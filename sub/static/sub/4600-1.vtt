02:32.277 --> 02:33.903
Rosebud.

03:12.276 --> 03:14.277
News on the March.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.798
Legendary was the Xanadu...

03:35.966 --> 03:39.468
...where Kubla Khan decreed
his stately pleasure dome.

03:39.636 --> 03:43.097
Today, almost as legendary,
is Florida's Xanadu...

03:43.265 --> 03:46.225
...the world's largest
private pleasure ground.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.689
Here on the deserts of the Gulf Coast,
a private mountain...

03:51.857 --> 03:53.900
...was commissioned
and successfully built.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.236
One hundred thousand trees,
twenty thousand tons of marble...

03:57.404 --> 03:59.989
...are the ingredients
of Xanadu's mountain.

04:01.033 --> 04:03.409
Contents of Xanadu's palace:

04:03.577 --> 04:07.705
Paintings, pictures, statues,
various stones of other palaces.

04:08.123 --> 04:09.916
A collection of everything.

04:10.083 --> 04:13.252
So big it can never
be cataloged or appraised.

04:13.420 --> 04:17.255
Enough for 10 museums,
the loot of the world.

04:20.844 --> 04:22.803
Xanadu's livestock...

04:23.847 --> 04:29.352
...the fowl of the air, the fish of the
sea, the beast of the field and jungle...

04:29.686 --> 04:33.940
...two of each,
the biggest private zoo since Noah.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.692
Like the pharaohs...

04:36.860 --> 04:40.821
...Xanadu's landlord leaves many stones
to mark his grave.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.866
Since the pyramids...

04:44.117 --> 04:46.744
...Xanadu is the costliest monument...

04:46.912 --> 04:49.330
...a man has built to himself.

05:02.386 --> 05:05.012
Here in Xanadu last week...

05:05.180 --> 05:08.265
...Xanadu's landlord was laid to rest.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.310
A potent figure of our century...

05:11.478 --> 05:13.604
...America's Kubla Khan:

05:14.064 --> 05:15.898
Charles Foster Kane.

05:43.135 --> 05:48.389
Its humble beginnings,
in this ramshackle building, a dying daily.

05:48.557 --> 05:50.975
Kane's empire, in its glory...

05:51.143 --> 05:55.271
...held dominion over 37 newspapers,
two syndicates...

05:55.480 --> 06:00.026
...a radio network,
an empire upon an empire.

06:00.193 --> 06:03.946
The first of grocery stores, paper mills...

06:04.114 --> 06:09.702
...apartment buildings,
factories, forests, ocean liners.

06:09.870 --> 06:13.122
An empire through which for 50 years...

06:13.290 --> 06:15.708
...flowed in an unending stream...

06:15.959 --> 06:19.211
...the wealth of the Earth's
third richest gold mine.

06:20.130 --> 06:23.716
Famed in American legend
is the origin of the Kane fortune.

06:23.884 --> 06:29.388
How, to boarding housekeeper Mary Kane,
by a defaulting boarder, in 1868...

06:29.556 --> 06:33.309
...was left the supposedly worthless deed
to an abandoned mineshaft:

06:33.477 --> 06:36.520
The Colorado Lode.

06:36.688 --> 06:40.775
Fifty-seven years later,
before a congressional investigation...

06:40.942 --> 06:44.320
...Walter P. Thatcher,
grand old man of Wall Street...

06:44.488 --> 06:48.115
...for years chief target
of Kane papers' attacks on trusts...

06:48.283 --> 06:50.576
...recalls a journey he made as a youth.

06:50.744 --> 06:54.080
My firm had been appointed trustee
by Mrs. Kane...

06:54.247 --> 06:56.499
...for a large fortune
she recently acquired.

06:56.666 --> 07:00.920
It was her wish that I take charge
of this boy, Charles Foster Kane.

07:01.088 --> 07:05.508
Chief, is it not, that on this occasion,
Charles Foster Kane...

07:05.675 --> 07:09.637
...personally attacked you after
striking you in the stomach with a sled?

07:11.014 --> 07:13.849
I shall read to the committee
a prepared statement...

07:14.017 --> 07:19.480
...which I have brought with me,
and then refuse to answer questions.

07:19.940 --> 07:23.234
Mr. Charles Foster Kane,
in every essence of his social beliefs...

07:23.401 --> 07:26.320
...and by the dangerous manner
he has persistently attacked...

07:26.488 --> 07:28.656
...American traditions
of private property...

07:28.824 --> 07:31.075
...initiative and opportunity
for advancement...

07:31.243 --> 07:35.079
...is, in fact, nothing more or less
than a communist.

07:35.247 --> 07:37.665
That same month in Union Square...

07:37.833 --> 07:40.376
The words "Charles Foster Kane"...

07:40.544 --> 07:44.046
...are a menace
to every workingman in this land.

07:44.381 --> 07:49.718
He is today what he has always been
A fascist.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.595
And still another opinion...

08:09.072 --> 08:12.575
Kane urged his country's entry
into one war...

08:12.784 --> 08:15.411
...opposed participation in another.

08:15.662 --> 08:19.456
Swung the election
to one American president at least.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.918
Spoke for millions of Americans.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.880
Was hated by as many more.

08:26.214 --> 08:29.758
For 40 years
appeared in Kane newsprint...

08:30.010 --> 08:34.346
...no public issue
on which Kane papers took no stand.

08:34.764 --> 08:40.059
No public man whom Kane himself
did not support or denounce.

08:40.227 --> 08:44.231
Often support, then denounce.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.951
Twice married, twice divorced.

08:56.286 --> 08:58.495
First to a president's niece...

08:58.663 --> 09:01.749
...Emily Norton, who left him in 1916.

09:02.292 --> 09:05.878
Died 1918 in a motor accident
with their son.

09:08.089 --> 09:10.633
Sixteen years after his first marriage...

09:10.800 --> 09:13.093
...two weeks after his first divorce...

09:13.303 --> 09:15.387
...Kane married Susan Alexander...

09:15.555 --> 09:18.807
...singer, at the Town Hall in Trenton,
New Jersey.

09:19.601 --> 09:25.064
For wife two, one-time opera-singing
Susan Alexander...

09:25.232 --> 09:28.317
...Kane built
Chicago's Municipal Opera House.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.945
$3 million.

09:31.112 --> 09:36.992
Conceived for Susan Alexander Kane,
half-finished before she divorced him...

09:37.160 --> 09:39.161
...the still unfinished...

09:39.329 --> 09:40.663
...Xanadu.

09:40.830 --> 09:43.999
No man can say.

09:47.337 --> 09:50.673
Kane, molder of mass opinion
though he was...

09:50.840 --> 09:53.467
...in all his life
was never granted elective office...

09:53.635 --> 09:55.219
...by the voters of his country.

09:55.387 --> 09:58.097
But Kane papers
were once strong indeed...

09:58.265 --> 10:00.766
...and once the prize seemed almost his.

10:01.017 --> 10:04.436
In 1916, as independent candidate
for governor...

10:04.604 --> 10:06.939
...the best elements of the state
behind him...

10:07.107 --> 10:11.860
...the White House seemingly the next easy
step in a lightning political career...

10:12.028 --> 10:15.864
...then suddenly, less than one week
before election...

10:16.449 --> 10:20.703
...defeat.
Shameful, ignominious.

10:20.870 --> 10:24.456
Defeat that set back for 20 years
the cause of reform in the U. S...

10:24.624 --> 10:28.252
...forever canceled political chances
for Charles Foster Kane.

10:30.964 --> 10:34.842
Then, in the first year
of the Great Depression...

10:35.010 --> 10:37.344
...a Kane paper closes.

10:37.512 --> 10:41.015
For Kane, in four short years, collapse.

10:41.391 --> 10:46.603
Eleven Kane papers merged,
more sold, scrapped.

10:56.239 --> 10:57.281
Is that correct?

10:57.449 --> 10:59.700
Don't believe everything you hear
on the radio.

10:59.868 --> 11:03.704
- Read the Inquirer.
- How were business conditions in Europe?

11:03.872 --> 11:07.750
How did I find business conditions
in Europe, Mr. Bones?

11:07.917 --> 11:09.251
With great difficulty.

11:12.130 --> 11:13.756
Are you glad to be back?

11:13.923 --> 11:16.425
I'm always glad to be back.
I'm an American.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.762
Always been an American.
Anything else?

11:19.929 --> 11:22.931
When I was a reporter,
we asked them quicker than that.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.559
What do you think
of the chances for war in Europe?

11:25.727 --> 11:29.980
I talked with the responsible leaders
of England, France, Germany and Italy.

11:30.148 --> 11:32.524
They're too intelligent
to embark on a project...

11:32.692 --> 11:35.152
...which would mean
the end of civilization.

11:35.320 --> 11:38.822
You can take my word for it,
there will be no war.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.829
Kane helped to change the world...

11:45.997 --> 11:48.624
...but Kane's world now is history...

11:48.792 --> 11:52.127
...and the great yellow journalist himself
lived to be history...

11:52.295 --> 11:54.588
...outlived his power to make it.

11:55.465 --> 11:59.468
Alone in his never-finished,
already decaying pleasure palace...

11:59.719 --> 12:03.138
...aloof, seldom visited,
never photographed...

12:03.431 --> 12:07.935
...an emperor of newsprint
continued to direct his failing empire.

12:08.103 --> 12:10.813
Vainly attempted to sway,
as he once did...

12:11.189 --> 12:14.525
...the destinies of a nation
that had ceased to listen to him...

12:14.692 --> 12:16.443
...ceased to trust him.

12:18.655 --> 12:23.283
Then last week, as it must to all men...

12:23.451 --> 12:26.036
...death came to Charles Foster Kane.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.498
News on the March.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.796
- That's it.
- Hello. Hello.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.841
- Stand by.
- I'll tell you if we want to run it again.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.552
- How about it, Mr. Rawlston?
- How do you like it?

12:41.719 --> 12:43.345
Seventy years in a man's life.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.556
That's a lot to try to get into a newsreel.

12:45.723 --> 12:48.058
It's a good short,
but what it needs is an angle.

12:48.226 --> 12:51.437
All we saw on that screen
was that Charles Foster Kane is dead.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.605
I know that. I read the papers.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.400
It isn't enough
to tell us what a man did...

12:56.568 --> 12:59.653
...you've got to tell us who he was.

12:59.821 --> 13:03.031
Wait a minute.
What were Kane's last words?

13:03.199 --> 13:05.033
Do you remember, boys?

13:05.201 --> 13:07.536
What were the last words
he said on Earth?

13:07.704 --> 13:09.830
Maybe he told us about himself
on his deathbed.

13:09.998 --> 13:12.916
- Maybe he didn't.
- All we saw was a big American.

13:13.084 --> 13:15.836
How did he differ from Ford,
Hearst or John Doe?

13:16.004 --> 13:18.672
- Yeah, sure.
- I tell you, a man's dying words...

13:18.840 --> 13:20.799
- What were they?
- You don't read the papers.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.385
When Charles Foster Kane died,
he said one word:

13:23.553 --> 13:26.263
"Rosebud."
That's all he said? Tough guy.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.724
Yes, "Rosebud." Just that one word.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.684
- But who is she?
- What was it?

13:30.852 --> 13:32.895
Here's a man
who could've been president...

13:33.062 --> 13:35.272
...who was as loved, hated
and talked about...

13:35.440 --> 13:37.900
...as any man in our time,
but when he dies...

13:38.067 --> 13:40.235
...something is on his mind
called Rosebud.

13:40.403 --> 13:42.779
- What does that mean?
- A racehorse he bet on once.

13:42.947 --> 13:45.240
- That didn't come in.
- But what was the race?

13:45.408 --> 13:46.450
Rosebud.

13:46.618 --> 13:47.701
- Thompson.
- Yes.

13:47.869 --> 13:51.246
- Hold this up a week, two if you must.
- Don't you think right after he's dead...

13:51.414 --> 13:56.084
Find out about Rosebud. Get in touch with
anybody who knew him or knew him well.

13:56.252 --> 13:57.961
That manager of his... Uh...

13:58.129 --> 14:00.547
Bernstein. His second wife.
She's still living.

14:00.715 --> 14:01.882
Susan Alexander Kane.

14:02.050 --> 14:04.801
- She runs a nightclub in Atlantic City.
- That's right.

14:04.969 --> 14:08.305
See them all. Get in touch with everybody
that ever worked for him...

14:08.473 --> 14:11.600
...whoever loved him,
whoever hated his guts.

14:11.768 --> 14:14.436
I don't mean go through
the city directory of course.

14:14.604 --> 14:16.104
I'll get on it right away.

14:16.272 --> 14:19.691
Good. Rosebud, dead or alive.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.444
It will probably turn out to be
a very simple thing.

15:01.985 --> 15:03.527
Miss Alexander.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.989
This is Mr. Thompson, Miss Alexander.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.449
I want another drink, John.

15:12.370 --> 15:15.247
Right away.
Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?

15:15.415 --> 15:18.917
- I'll have a highball, please.
- Who told you you could sit down?

15:20.795 --> 15:22.671
I thought maybe we could have a talk.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.256
Think again.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.634
Can't you people leave me alone?

15:27.802 --> 15:29.928
I'm minding my own business,
you mind yours.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.806
If I could just have a talk with you,
Miss Alexander. I'd...

15:32.974 --> 15:34.683
Get out of here.

15:36.561 --> 15:37.811
Get out!

15:39.022 --> 15:40.689
- Sorry.
- Get out.

15:40.982 --> 15:43.442
- Maybe some other time.
- Get out.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.579
Gino.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.207
Get her another highball.

15:59.542 --> 16:02.002
She just won't talk to nobody,
Mr. Thompson.

16:02.170 --> 16:03.420
Okay.

16:05.548 --> 16:08.884
- Another double?
- Yeah.

16:09.052 --> 16:10.886
Hello, I want New York City.

16:11.054 --> 16:16.642
Courtland 79970.
This is Atlantic City 46827. All right.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.310
Hey.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.562
- She's, uh...
- Yeah.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.356
She'll snap out of it.

16:22.523 --> 16:25.734
Why, until he died, she'd just as soon
talk about Mr. Kane as any...

16:25.902 --> 16:27.235
- Hello.
- Sooner.

16:27.403 --> 16:30.030
This is Thompson.
Let me talk to the chief.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.825
Mr. Rawlston? She won't talk.

16:34.077 --> 16:36.870
The second Mrs. Kane.
About Rosebud or anything else.

16:37.038 --> 16:38.705
I'm calling from Atlantic City.

16:38.873 --> 16:42.417
Tomorrow I'll go to Philadelphia,
to Thatcher Library, to see his diary.

16:42.585 --> 16:43.835
They're expecting me.

16:44.003 --> 16:47.464
Then I've a meeting with his general
manager in New York. Bernstein.

16:47.632 --> 16:49.007
Then I'm coming back here.

16:49.175 --> 16:52.803
Yeah, I'll see everybody
that's still alive. Goodbye.

16:52.970 --> 16:55.013
- Hey... Um...
- John.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.932
You just might be able to help me.

16:57.100 --> 17:01.103
When she used to talk about Mr. Kane,
did she ever mention Rosebud?

17:01.270 --> 17:02.771
"Rosebud"?

17:02.939 --> 17:05.523
Thank you, Mr. Thompson, thanks.

17:05.692 --> 17:10.444
As a matter of fact, just the other day,
when the papers were full of it...

17:11.030 --> 17:13.156
...I asked her.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.826
She never heard of Rosebud.

17:28.256 --> 17:31.967
The directors of the Thatcher
Memorial Library have asked me...

17:32.135 --> 17:35.345
...to remind you about the conditions
under which you may...

17:35.513 --> 17:38.598
...inspect certain portions
of Mr. Thatcher's unpublished memoirs.

17:38.766 --> 17:41.309
- I remember them.
- Yes, Jennings, I'll bring him in.

17:41.477 --> 17:43.937
- All I want is an hour...
- Under no circumstances...

17:44.105 --> 17:47.774
...are direct quotes from his manuscript
to be used by you. You may follow me.

17:47.942 --> 17:50.110
That's all right. I'm just looking for...

18:02.832 --> 18:04.499
Jennings.

18:09.505 --> 18:10.505
Thank you, Jennings.

18:11.883 --> 18:15.051
You will be required to leave this room
at 4:30 promptly.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.679
You will confine yourself,
it is our understanding...

18:17.847 --> 18:21.224
...to the chapters in Mr. Thatcher's
manuscript regarding Mr. Kane.

18:21.392 --> 18:23.268
That's all I'm interested in.

18:24.187 --> 18:25.562
Thank you.

18:26.856 --> 18:30.692
Pages 83 to 142.

19:08.231 --> 19:10.023
Come on, boys.

19:10.191 --> 19:12.442
- Be careful, Charles.
- Mrs. Kane.

19:12.610 --> 19:14.736
Pull your muffler around your neck,
Charles.

19:14.904 --> 19:17.072
Mrs. Kane,
I think we'll have to tell him now.

19:17.240 --> 19:21.201
Yes, I'll sign those papers now,
Mr. Thatcher.

19:21.369 --> 19:24.079
You people seem to forget
that I'm the boy's father.

19:24.247 --> 19:27.082
It's going to be done exactly the way
I've told Mr. Thatcher.

19:27.250 --> 19:30.919
There's nothing wrong with Colorado.
I don't see why we can't raise our son...

19:31.087 --> 19:32.754
...just because we came into money.

19:32.922 --> 19:35.799
If I want to, I can go to court.
A father has a right to.

19:35.967 --> 19:39.177
A boarder that beats his bill
and leaves worthless stock behind...

19:39.345 --> 19:42.180
That property is as much my property
as anybody's...

19:42.348 --> 19:45.183
...now that it's valuable.
And if Fred Graves had any idea...

19:45.351 --> 19:48.854
...this would happen, he'd have made out
the certificates in both our names.

19:49.021 --> 19:52.399
- But they're made out to Mrs. Kane.
- He owed the money to both of us.

19:52.567 --> 19:57.279
- "The bank's decision in all matters..."
- I don't hold with giving Charles to a bank...

19:57.446 --> 19:59.614
- Stop this nonsense.
- We're a bit uneducated...

19:59.782 --> 20:02.033
"The bank's decision
concerning his education...

20:02.201 --> 20:04.411
...his places of residence,
is to be final."

20:04.579 --> 20:08.039
- The idea of a bank being the guardian...
- Stop this nonsense, Jim.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.001
"We will assume full management
of the Colorado Lode"...

20:11.168 --> 20:13.753
...which I repeat, Mrs. Kane,
you are the sole owner.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.964
- Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
- Right here.

20:16.132 --> 20:19.175
Mary, I'm asking you for the last time.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.761
You'd think I hadn't been
a good husband or father...

20:21.929 --> 20:23.388
The sum of $50,000 a year...

20:23.556 --> 20:26.641
...is to be paid to you
and Mr. Kane as long as you both live...

20:26.809 --> 20:28.935
...and thereafter to the survivor.

20:29.520 --> 20:32.689
- Let's hope it's all for the best.
- It is.

20:32.857 --> 20:35.066
The union forever!

20:37.570 --> 20:40.697
Why I can't raise my own boy
is more than I can understand.

20:40.865 --> 20:42.782
Go on, Mr. Thatcher.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.994
Everything else, the principal,
as well as all monies earned...

20:46.162 --> 20:50.165
...is to be administered by the bank in
trust for your son, Charles Foster Kane...

20:50.333 --> 20:52.876
...until he reaches his 25th birthday,
at which time...

20:53.044 --> 20:55.337
...he is to come
into complete possession.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.088
Charles!

20:58.841 --> 21:00.425
Go on, Mr. Thatcher.

21:00.593 --> 21:05.847
Well, it's almost 5.
Don't you think I'd better meet the boy?

21:06.015 --> 21:07.974
I've got his trunk all packed.

21:09.352 --> 21:11.686
I've had it packed for a week now.

21:14.190 --> 21:16.399
I've arranged for a tutor
to meet us in Chicago.

21:16.567 --> 21:18.735
I'd have brought him
here with me, but...

21:19.487 --> 21:21.196
- Charles.
- Lookie, Mom.

21:21.364 --> 21:22.739
You'd better come inside.

21:22.907 --> 21:25.784
- That's quite a snowman.
- I took the pipe out of his mouth.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.369
Did you make it yourself?

21:27.536 --> 21:30.080
Maybe I'll make some
teeth and whiskers.

21:30.373 --> 21:32.415
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.876
- Hello.
- How do you do, Charles?

21:35.044 --> 21:36.503
He comes from the East.

21:36.671 --> 21:38.046
- Pa.
- Hello, Charlie.

21:38.214 --> 21:39.422
Charles.

21:40.216 --> 21:41.549
Yes, Mommy?

21:43.135 --> 21:46.137
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you
on a trip with him tonight.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.931
You'll be leaving on number 10.

21:48.099 --> 21:50.100
That's the train with all the lights on it.

21:50.267 --> 21:51.309
You going, Mom?

21:51.477 --> 21:54.688
No. Your mother won't be going
right away, but she'll...

21:55.398 --> 21:56.773
Where am I going?

21:56.941 --> 22:00.902
You're going to see Chicago and New York
and Washington, maybe. Ain't he?

22:01.070 --> 22:02.153
He certainly is.

22:02.321 --> 22:05.615
I wish I were a boy going on a trip
like that for the first time.

22:05.783 --> 22:08.952
- Why aren't you coming with us, Mom?
- We have to stay here, Charles.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.913
You're gonna live with Mr. Thatcher
from now on, Charlie.

22:12.081 --> 22:15.500
You're gonna be rich.
Your ma figures, well, that is...

22:15.751 --> 22:18.837
...me and her decided this ain't the place
for you to grow up in.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.297
You'll probably be
the richest man someday...

22:21.465 --> 22:23.883
...and you ought to get...
You won't be lonely.

22:24.051 --> 22:27.429
Lonely, of course not. We're going to have
fine times together, we are.

22:27.596 --> 22:30.432
Let's shake hands. Come.
I'm not that frightening, am I?

22:30.725 --> 22:33.018
- What do you say? Let's shake.
- Why, Charles.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.894
- Why, you almost hurt me.
- Charlie!

22:35.062 --> 22:37.439
Sleds aren't to hit people,
but to sleigh with.

22:37.606 --> 22:38.606
Mom!

22:38.774 --> 22:41.317
You got to go. Jim!

22:41.652 --> 22:44.946
I'm sorry, Mr. Thatcher.
What the kid needs is a good thrashing.

22:45.114 --> 22:46.906
- That's what you think, is it?
- Yes.

22:47.074 --> 22:51.327
That's why he's going to be brought up
where you can't get at him.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.391
Well, Charles...

23:15.352 --> 23:18.229
...Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.565
And a happy New Year.

23:20.733 --> 23:21.941
In closing...

23:22.109 --> 23:25.820
...may I remind you your 25th birthday,
which is now approaching...

23:25.988 --> 23:28.656
...marks your complete independence
from the firm...

23:28.824 --> 23:32.285
...of Thatcher & Company, as well as
acquiring the full responsibility...

23:32.453 --> 23:34.788
...for the world's sixth largest
private fortune.

23:34.955 --> 23:37.999
- Got that?
- "The world's sixth largest private fortune."

23:38.167 --> 23:42.003
I don't think you realize the full importance
of the position you are to occupy.

23:42.171 --> 23:44.506
I am therefore enclosing
for your consideration...

23:44.673 --> 23:47.258
...a list of your holdings,
extensively cross-indexed.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.552
"Dear Mr. Thatcher."
It's from Mr. Kane.

23:49.720 --> 23:52.138
- Go on.
- "Sorry, I'm not interested in gold mines...

23:52.306 --> 23:54.224
...oil wells, shipping or real estate."

23:54.391 --> 23:56.518
Not interested?

23:56.685 --> 24:00.021
The New York Inquirer.

24:00.189 --> 24:03.024
A little newspaper we acquired
in a foreclosure proceeding.

24:03.192 --> 24:05.485
Don't sell it.
I am coming back to take charge.

24:05.653 --> 24:08.029
"I think it would be fun
to run a newspaper."

24:08.197 --> 24:12.242
I think it would be fun
to run a newspaper.

24:20.084 --> 24:22.210
"Traction Trust exposed."

24:22.378 --> 24:24.921
"Traction Trust bleeds public white."

24:25.089 --> 24:28.341
"Traction Trust smashed by Inquirer."

24:28.509 --> 24:31.928
"Landlords refuse to clear slums."

24:32.263 --> 24:36.599
"Inquirerwins slum fight." Oh...

24:37.309 --> 24:41.187
"Wall Street backs copper swindle."

24:41.355 --> 24:43.398
"Copper robbers indicted."

24:43.566 --> 24:46.401
"Galleons of Spain off Jersey Coast."

24:46.569 --> 24:49.070
Is that really your idea
of how to run a newspaper?

24:49.238 --> 24:52.574
I don't know how to run a newspaper.
I try everything I can think of.

24:52.741 --> 24:55.577
You know there's not
the slightest proof this...

24:55.744 --> 24:58.580
...armada's off the Jersey Coast.
Hello, Mr. Bernstein.

24:58.747 --> 25:00.123
Can you prove it isn't?

25:00.291 --> 25:03.001
Mr. Bernstein,
I'd like you to meet Mr. Thatcher.

25:03.752 --> 25:04.878
- Mr. Leland.
- Hello.

25:05.045 --> 25:06.629
Mr. Thatcher, my ex-guardian.

25:06.797 --> 25:11.926
We have no secrets from our readers.
Thatcher is one of our devoted readers.

25:12.094 --> 25:15.847
He knows what's wrong with every copy
of the Inquirer since I took over. Read.

25:16.015 --> 25:18.975
"Girls delightful in Cuba. Stop.
Could send you prose poems..."

25:19.143 --> 25:22.854
...about scenery but don't feel right
spending your money. Stop.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.773
There is no war in Cuba."
Signed "Wheeler." Any answer?

25:25.941 --> 25:30.403
You provide
the prose poems, I'll provide the war.

25:30.571 --> 25:33.198
- That's fine.
- I like it myself. Send it right away.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.617
I came to see you
about this campaign of yours.

25:35.784 --> 25:38.578
The Inquirer's campaign against
the Public Transit Company.

25:38.746 --> 25:40.872
Do you know anything
we can use against them?

25:41.040 --> 25:42.540
Still the college boy, eh?

25:42.708 --> 25:46.711
I was expelled from college, a lot
of colleges, you remember? I remember.

25:46.879 --> 25:50.215
Charles, I think I should remind you
of a fact you have forgotten.

25:50.382 --> 25:54.135
You're one of the largest stockholders
in the Public Transit Company.

25:54.303 --> 25:57.305
The trouble is, you don't realize
you're talking to two people.

25:57.473 --> 26:00.516
As Charles Foster Kane
who owns 82,364 shares...

26:00.684 --> 26:04.395
...of Public Transit Preferred. See,
I do have a general idea of my holdings.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.023
I sympathize with you.
Kane is a scoundrel...

26:07.316 --> 26:10.360
...his paper should be closed,
a committee formed to boycott him.

26:10.527 --> 26:14.239
If you can form such a committee,
put me down for a contribution of $1000.

26:14.406 --> 26:17.158
On the other hand,
I am the publisher of the Inquirer.

26:17.326 --> 26:21.412
As such it's my duty, I'll let you in on a
little secret. It is also my pleasure...

26:21.580 --> 26:25.708
...to see that the working people of this
community aren't robbed by a pack...

26:25.876 --> 26:28.419
...of money-mad pirates, just because...

26:28.837 --> 26:32.006
...they have no one
to look after their interests.

26:32.424 --> 26:35.343
I'll let you in on another little secret,
Mr. Thatcher:

26:35.511 --> 26:39.305
I think I'm the man to do it.
You see, I have money and property.

26:39.473 --> 26:43.351
If I don't look after the interests
of the underprivileged, somebody else will.

26:43.519 --> 26:45.520
Maybe somebody
without money or property.

26:45.688 --> 26:46.896
That would be too bad.

26:47.064 --> 26:49.107
I saw your financial statement today.

26:49.275 --> 26:52.193
- Oh, did you?
- Tell me, honestly...

26:52.403 --> 26:56.614
...don't you think it's rather unwise to
continue this philanthropic enterprise...

26:56.782 --> 26:59.742
...this Inquirer, that is costing you
$1 million a year?

26:59.910 --> 27:04.664
Yes. I did lose $1 million last year.
I expect to lose $1 million this year.

27:04.832 --> 27:07.417
I expect to lose $1 million next year.

27:07.584 --> 27:10.044
At the rate of $1 million a year...

27:10.212 --> 27:14.007
...I'll have to close
this place in 60 years.

27:23.225 --> 27:25.560
"With respect to the said newspapers..."

27:25.728 --> 27:28.146
...the said Charles Foster Kane...

27:28.314 --> 27:31.858
...hereby relinquishes
all control thereof...

27:32.276 --> 27:34.986
...and of the syndicates
pertaining thereto...

27:35.154 --> 27:41.200
...and any and all other newspaper, press
and publishing properties of any kind...

27:41.660 --> 27:43.953
"...and agrees to abandon
all claim thereto..."

27:44.121 --> 27:47.415
- Which means we're bust all right.
- Well, out of cash.

27:47.583 --> 27:49.042
All right, Mr. Bernstein.

27:49.209 --> 27:53.629
I've read it, Mr. Thatcher,
just let me sign it and go home.

27:53.797 --> 27:57.091
You're too old
to call me Mr. Thatcher, Charles.

27:57.259 --> 28:00.219
You're too old to be called
anything else.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.555
You were always too old.

28:03.182 --> 28:06.809
"In consideration thereof,
Thatcher & Company agrees...

28:06.977 --> 28:09.729
...to pay to Charles Foster Kane,
as long as he lives..."

28:09.897 --> 28:11.439
My allowance.

28:11.607 --> 28:15.401
"You will continue to maintain
over your newspapers a large...

28:15.569 --> 28:20.281
...measure of control.
Measure of control."

28:20.783 --> 28:23.993
And we shall seek your advice.

28:26.580 --> 28:30.458
This depression is temporary.

28:31.627 --> 28:35.463
There's always the chance
that you'll die richer than I will.

28:35.672 --> 28:38.091
It's a cinch I'll die
richer than I was born.

28:38.258 --> 28:40.635
We never lost as much as we made.

28:40.803 --> 28:45.223
Yes, yes, but your methods.
You know, Charles...

28:45.391 --> 28:50.603
...you never made a single investment.
You always used money to...

28:51.313 --> 28:55.191
To buy things. Hmm?

28:56.527 --> 28:58.820
To buy things.

28:59.780 --> 29:03.741
My mother should have chosen
a less reliable banker.

29:10.582 --> 29:14.335
I always gagged on that silver spoon.

29:15.838 --> 29:18.339
You know, Mr. Bernstein...

29:20.008 --> 29:22.718
...if I hadn't been very rich...

29:23.303 --> 29:25.555
...I might have been a really great man.

29:25.722 --> 29:27.890
Don't you think you are?

29:29.893 --> 29:33.104
I think I did pretty well
under the circumstances.

29:34.940 --> 29:37.358
What would you like to have been?

29:40.154 --> 29:42.488
Everything you hate.

29:50.372 --> 29:54.083
- Oh...
- I beg your pardon, sir? What did you say?

29:54.251 --> 29:58.004
- It's 4:30. Isn't it, Jennings?
- Yes, ma'am.

29:58.172 --> 30:00.673
You have enjoyed a very rare privilege,
young man.

30:00.841 --> 30:03.843
- Did you find what you were looking for?
- No.

30:06.305 --> 30:08.264
- You're not Rosebud, are you?
- What?

30:08.432 --> 30:11.392
Rosebud, and your name is Jennings,
isn't it?

30:11.560 --> 30:15.980
Goodbye, everybody.
Thanks for the use of the hall.

30:16.732 --> 30:20.234
Who's a busy man, me?
I'm chairman of the board.

30:20.402 --> 30:22.737
I got nothing but time.
What do you want to know?

30:22.905 --> 30:27.033
We thought maybe... If we could
find out what he meant by his last words...

30:27.201 --> 30:29.619
...as he was dying.
That "Rosebud"?

30:29.786 --> 30:32.205
Maybe some girl?

30:32.372 --> 30:34.499
There were a lot of them
in the early days.

30:34.666 --> 30:37.793
It's hardly likely that Mr. Kane
could have met someone casually...

30:37.961 --> 30:40.129
...and then 50 years later,
on his deathbed...

30:40.297 --> 30:45.092
Well, you're pretty young, Mr. Thompson.

30:45.260 --> 30:48.846
A fellow will remember a lot of things
you wouldn't think he'd remember.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.640
You take me.

30:50.807 --> 30:55.853
One day, back in 1896, I was crossing
over to Jersey on the ferry...

30:56.063 --> 30:59.190
...and as we pulled out,
there was another ferry pulling in...

30:59.358 --> 31:02.109
...and on it there was a girl
waiting to get off.

31:02.945 --> 31:04.654
A white dress she had on.

31:04.821 --> 31:07.281
She was carrying a white parasol.

31:07.616 --> 31:10.034
I only saw her for one second.

31:10.202 --> 31:15.623
She didn't see me at all, but I'll
bet a month hasn't gone by since...

31:16.500 --> 31:19.085
...that I haven't thought of that girl.

31:19.586 --> 31:23.714
- Who else have you been to see?
- Well, I went down to Atlantic City.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.758
Susie?

31:25.926 --> 31:27.260
Thank you.

31:27.803 --> 31:30.680
I called her myself the day after he died.

31:31.014 --> 31:33.432
I thought maybe somebody ought to.

31:34.726 --> 31:38.980
- She couldn't even come to the phone.
- I'll be seeing her again in a couple of days.

31:39.147 --> 31:41.107
About Rosebud, Mr. Bernstein.

31:41.316 --> 31:44.902
If you'd talk about anything connected
with Mr. Kane that you can remember.

31:45.070 --> 31:46.904
You were with him from the beginning.

31:47.072 --> 31:52.451
From before the beginning, young fellow.
And now it's after the end.

31:53.495 --> 31:55.788
Have you tried to see anybody
except Susie?

31:55.956 --> 32:00.167
I haven't seen anybody else, but I've
been through Walter Thatcher's journal.

32:00.335 --> 32:04.755
- That man was the biggest fool I ever met.
- He made an awful lot of money.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.675
Well, it's no trick
to make a lot of money...

32:08.176 --> 32:10.386
...if all you want...

32:11.972 --> 32:14.098
...is to make a lot of money.

32:16.018 --> 32:18.060
You take Mr. Kane.

32:19.521 --> 32:21.814
It wasn't money he wanted.

32:23.567 --> 32:27.778
Thatcher never did figure him out.
Sometimes even I couldn't.

32:27.946 --> 32:31.365
You know who you ought to see?
Mr. Leland.

32:31.533 --> 32:34.535
He was Mr. Kane's closest friend.
They went to school together.

32:34.703 --> 32:35.828
Harvard?

32:35.996 --> 32:39.540
Oh, Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
Cornell, Switzerland.

32:39.708 --> 32:42.335
He was thrown out of a lot of colleges.

32:42.544 --> 32:45.212
Mr. Leland never had a nickel.

32:45.505 --> 32:48.466
One of those families
where the father is worth $10 million...

32:48.634 --> 32:52.887
...then one day he shoots himself,
and it turns out there's nothing but debts.

32:54.556 --> 32:56.807
He was with Mr. Kane and me...

32:57.809 --> 33:00.728
...the first day Mr. Kane took over
the Inquirer.

33:08.403 --> 33:10.905
Take a good look at it, Jedediah.

33:11.156 --> 33:15.034
It's going to look a lot different
one of these days. Come on.

33:23.794 --> 33:27.046
There ain't no bedrooms in this joint.
That's a newspaper building.

33:27.214 --> 33:30.591
You're getting paid, mister,
for opinions or for hauling?

33:30.759 --> 33:31.801
Ugh.

33:34.763 --> 33:37.682
- Jedediah.
- After you, Mr. Kane.

33:49.903 --> 33:52.113
Excuse me, sir, but I...

33:55.075 --> 33:58.869
Welcome, Mr. Kane. Welcome.

33:59.538 --> 34:02.206
Welcome to the Inquirer, Mr. Kane.

34:02.374 --> 34:04.583
I am Herbert Carter, the editor-in-chief.

34:04.751 --> 34:08.545
- Thank you, Mr. Carter. This is Mr. Leland...
- How do you do, Mr. Leland?

34:08.714 --> 34:11.549
Our new dramatic critic.
I hope I haven't made a mistake.

34:11.717 --> 34:13.842
- It is dramatic critic, right?
- That's right.

34:14.010 --> 34:17.596
- Are they standing for me?
- You? Oh, Mr. Kane.

34:17.806 --> 34:18.889
Standing?

34:19.056 --> 34:20.599
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

34:20.766 --> 34:23.018
I thought it would be a
nice little gesture.

34:23.186 --> 34:26.313
- Ask them to sit down, will you, please.
- The new publisher.

34:26.857 --> 34:30.650
- You may resume your duties, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

34:30.819 --> 34:34.155
- I didn't know your plans.
- I don't know my plans myself.

34:34.489 --> 34:36.741
- Matter of fact, I haven't got any plans.
- No?

34:36.908 --> 34:38.284
Except to get out a newspaper.

34:43.373 --> 34:45.081
- Whoops.
- Mr. Bernstein.

34:45.250 --> 34:46.458
Yes, Mr. Kane.

34:46.626 --> 34:48.918
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein.

34:49.087 --> 34:54.007
- Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
- How do you do, Mr. Carter?

34:54.176 --> 34:56.010
- Mr. Carter.
- How do you do?

34:57.012 --> 34:59.305
- Yes, Mr. Bernstine.
- Stein.

34:59.473 --> 35:03.017
- Kane.
- Mr. Carter, is this your office?

35:03.185 --> 35:07.271
My little private sanctum
is at your disposal.

35:07.439 --> 35:10.816
- Excuse me.
- But I don't understand.

35:11.193 --> 35:15.196
Mr. Carter, I'm going to live right here
in your office as long as I have to.

35:16.323 --> 35:18.199
Live here? Yes?

35:18.366 --> 35:21.118
- Excuse me.
- But a morning newspaper, after all...

35:21.286 --> 35:22.369
Excuse me.

35:22.537 --> 35:26.207
We're practically closed
for 12 hours a day.

35:26.500 --> 35:29.543
That's one of the things
that's going to have to be changed here.

35:29.711 --> 35:33.214
- The news goes on for 24 hours a day.
- Twenty-four?

35:33.381 --> 35:36.675
- That's right.
- Excuse me.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.427
It's impossible...

35:38.595 --> 35:43.557
I've drawn that cartoon.
I'm no good as a cartoonist.

35:43.725 --> 35:45.226
You certainly aren't.

35:45.393 --> 35:47.102
You're the dramatic critic, Leland.

35:47.270 --> 35:49.146
- You still eating?
- I'm still hungry.

35:49.314 --> 35:51.732
Here's a front-page story
in the Chronicle...

35:51.900 --> 35:54.902
...about a Mrs. Harry Silverstone
in Brooklyn who's missing.

35:55.070 --> 35:59.615
She's probably murdered. Why isn't
there something about it in the Inquirer?

35:59.783 --> 36:01.492
We're running a newspaper...

36:01.660 --> 36:04.578
I'm absolutely starving to death.
...not a scandal sheet.

36:05.455 --> 36:06.622
That's all right.

36:06.790 --> 36:10.709
Mr. Carter, here is a three-column headline
in the Chronicle.

36:10.877 --> 36:13.295
Why hasn't the Inquirer
a three-column headline?

36:13.463 --> 36:14.880
- The news wasn't big enough.
- Mm-hm.

36:15.048 --> 36:19.677
Mr. Carter, if the headline is big enough,
it makes the news big enough.

36:19.845 --> 36:22.388
- That's right!
- The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone...

36:22.556 --> 36:24.640
There's no proof
that she was murdered, or dead.

36:24.808 --> 36:27.601
It says she's missing.
The neighbors are getting suspicious.

36:27.769 --> 36:30.563
It's not our function
to report the gossip of housewives.

36:30.730 --> 36:34.859
If we were interested in that kind of thing,
we could fill the paper twice over, daily.

36:35.026 --> 36:38.279
That's the kind of thing we are going to be
interested in from now on.

36:38.446 --> 36:41.365
I want you to send your best man
to see Mr. Silverstone.

36:41.533 --> 36:45.286
Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't
produce his wife, Mrs. Silverstone...

36:45.453 --> 36:47.454
...the Inquirerwill have him arrested.
Wha...?

36:47.622 --> 36:50.040
Tell Mr. Silverstone
he's a detective from, uh...

36:50.208 --> 36:52.626
- Central Office.
- The Central Office.

36:52.961 --> 36:57.423
If Mr. Silverstone gets suspicious
and asks to see your man's badge...

36:57.591 --> 37:01.385
...your man is to get indignant
and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist.

37:01.636 --> 37:04.805
Loudly, so the neighbors can hear.
You ready for dinner, Jedediah?

37:04.973 --> 37:08.142
I can't see that the function
of a respectable newspaper...

37:08.310 --> 37:11.437
Thank you so much, Mr. Carter.
Goodbye.

37:12.022 --> 37:13.272
Goodbye.

37:13.982 --> 37:16.817
Paper! Read all about it!

37:17.068 --> 37:19.945
Read all about it
in the early morning Chronicle.

37:20.113 --> 37:22.531
The mystery of the lady
that vanished in Brooklyn.

37:23.992 --> 37:27.661
Read all about it
in the early morning Chronicle.

37:40.133 --> 37:43.719
We'll be on the street soon,
Charlie, another 10 minutes.

37:43.887 --> 37:46.513
Three hours and 50 minutes late,
but we did it.

37:46.681 --> 37:48.182
- Tired?
- A tough day.

37:48.350 --> 37:49.892
- A wasted day.
- Wasted?

37:50.060 --> 37:52.937
You only made the paper over
four times tonight, that's all.

37:53.188 --> 37:56.565
I've changed the front page a little,
Mr. Bernstein. That's not enough.

37:56.733 --> 38:00.945
There's something I've got to get into
this paper besides pictures and print.

38:01.529 --> 38:04.573
I've got to make the New York Inquirer
as important to New York...

38:04.741 --> 38:06.617
...as the gas in that light.

38:07.243 --> 38:08.994
What are you going to do, Charlie?

38:09.162 --> 38:13.290
My Declaration of Principles.
Don't smile, Jedediah.

38:13.708 --> 38:16.210
I've got it all written out here.

38:16.711 --> 38:19.713
You don't want to make any promises
you don't want to keep.

38:19.881 --> 38:21.548
These'll be kept.

38:22.384 --> 38:24.885
"I'll provide the people of this city..."

38:25.220 --> 38:28.806
...with a daily paper
that will tell all the news honestly.

38:30.058 --> 38:33.352
- I will also provide..."
- That's two sentences starting with "I."

38:33.520 --> 38:36.021
People will know who's responsible...

38:36.189 --> 38:40.150
...and they'll get the truth in the Inquirer,
quickly, simply and entertainingly.

38:40.318 --> 38:43.570
No special interests will be allowed
to interfere with that truth.

38:43.738 --> 38:47.574
"I will also provide them with a fighting
and tireless champion of their rights...

38:47.742 --> 38:50.327
...as citizens and as human beings."

38:50.996 --> 38:52.287
Signed:

38:52.664 --> 38:55.249
"Charles Foster Kane."

38:57.210 --> 38:59.837
- Can I have that, Charlie?
- I'm going to print it.

39:00.005 --> 39:01.422
Solly!

39:02.424 --> 39:03.424
Yes, Mr. Kane?

39:03.591 --> 39:06.385
I want you to run this editorial
in a box on the front page.

39:06.553 --> 39:07.928
This morning's front page?

39:08.096 --> 39:11.098
That's right, Solly,
that means we'll have to remake again.

39:11.266 --> 39:12.975
- Yes.
- Go down and tell them.

39:13.143 --> 39:14.435
- All right.
- Solly.

39:14.728 --> 39:18.439
When you're through with that,
I'd like to have it back.

39:20.108 --> 39:23.360
I'd like to keep that particular
piece of paper myself.

39:23.528 --> 39:27.573
I have a hunch it might turn out
to be something pretty important.

39:27.824 --> 39:29.950
- A document...
- Sure.

39:30.118 --> 39:33.537
...Like the Declaration of Independence
and the Constitution...

39:34.247 --> 39:36.874
...and my first report card at school.

40:05.153 --> 40:08.405
I know you're tired, gentlemen,
but I brought you here for a reason.

40:08.573 --> 40:12.159
- This little pilgrimage will do us good.
- The Chronicle's a good newspaper.

40:12.327 --> 40:15.329
Chronicle's a good idea for a newspaper.
Notice the circulation.

40:15.497 --> 40:20.292
495,000.
But look who's working for the Chronicle.

40:20.460 --> 40:23.629
- With them, it's no trick to get circulation.
- You're right.

40:23.838 --> 40:27.049
You know how long it took
the Chronicle to get that staff together?

40:27.217 --> 40:29.968
- Twenty years.
- Twenty years?

40:30.512 --> 40:35.516
Six years ago, I looked at a picture
of the world's greatest newspaper men.

40:35.683 --> 40:37.851
I felt like a kid in
front of a candy store.

40:38.019 --> 40:41.980
Tonight, six years later,
I got my candy, all of it.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.399
Welcome, gentlemen, to the Inquirer.

40:44.567 --> 40:47.402
Make an extra copy of that picture
and mail it to the Chronicle.

40:49.280 --> 40:52.533
It'll make you all happy to learn
that our circulation this morning...

40:52.700 --> 40:55.786
684,000.

40:56.412 --> 41:00.040
684,132.

41:00.291 --> 41:01.458
Right.

41:02.001 --> 41:05.629
I hope you'll forgive my rudeness
in taking leave of you.

41:05.797 --> 41:08.173
I'm going abroad next week
for a vacation.

41:08.341 --> 41:11.802
I've promised my doctor for sometime
that I would leave when I could.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.303
I now realize I can't.

41:14.681 --> 41:17.015
Say, Mr. Kane,
as long as you're promising...

41:17.183 --> 41:21.061
...there's a lot of pictures and statues
in Europe you ain't bought yet.

41:21.229 --> 41:23.147
You can't blame me, Mr. Bernstein.

41:23.565 --> 41:26.191
They've been making statues
for 2000 years.

41:26.359 --> 41:28.360
And I've only been buying for five.

41:28.528 --> 41:30.988
- Promise me, Mr. Kane.
- I promise, Mr. Bernstein.

41:31.156 --> 41:33.907
- Thank you.
- Mr. Bernstein?

41:34.075 --> 41:36.743
You don't expect me to keep
any of those promises, do you?

41:39.080 --> 41:41.123
And now, gentlemen!

41:41.291 --> 41:44.501
Your complete attention, if you please.

41:50.425 --> 41:53.510
Are we going to declare war on Spain?

42:01.352 --> 42:04.897
- Oh, mama, here they come.
- Shoot me while I'm happy.

42:12.697 --> 42:18.285
I said, "Are we going to declare
war on Spain, or are we not?"

42:18.453 --> 42:20.287
The Inquirer already has.

42:20.622 --> 42:24.458
You long-faced, overdressed anarchist.

42:24.667 --> 42:26.418
I am not overdressed.

42:26.586 --> 42:29.880
You are, too.
Mr. Bernstein, look at his necktie.

42:30.048 --> 42:31.965
Let's have the song about Charlie.

42:32.133 --> 42:35.427
- Is there a song about Charlie?
- Is there a song about you, Mr. Kane?

42:35.595 --> 42:39.890
You buy a bag of peanuts in this town,
you get a song written about you.

42:49.734 --> 42:52.069
I've seen that fellow. He's good.

42:52.278 --> 42:53.612
Good evening, Mr. Kane.

42:53.780 --> 42:55.155
There is a man There is a man

42:55.323 --> 42:56.698
A certain man A certain man

42:56.908 --> 43:00.160
And for the poor you may be sure
That he'll do all he can

43:00.328 --> 43:01.954
- Who is this one?
- Who is this one?

43:02.121 --> 43:03.789
- This favorite son
- This favorite son

43:03.957 --> 43:06.708
Just by his action
Has the traction magnates on the run

43:06.876 --> 43:08.669
- Who loves to smoke
- Who loves to smoke

43:08.836 --> 43:10.212
- Enjoys a joke
- Ha-ha-ha

43:10.421 --> 43:13.382
Who wouldn't get a bit upset
If he were really broke

43:13.549 --> 43:15.217
- With wealth and fame
- With wealth and fame

43:15.385 --> 43:16.718
He's still the same

43:16.886 --> 43:20.389
I'll bet you five you're not alive
If you don't know his name

43:25.895 --> 43:27.854
What is his name?

43:28.022 --> 43:30.190
It's Charlie Kane, it's Mister Kane!

43:30.358 --> 43:34.152
He doesn't like that Mister
He likes good old Charlie Kane

43:49.794 --> 43:52.754
- Isn't it wonderful? Such a party.
- Yes.

43:52.922 --> 43:54.673
What's the matter?

43:54.841 --> 43:58.051
Who says a miss was made to kiss

43:58.219 --> 44:01.221
And when he meets one
Always tries to do exactly this

44:01.389 --> 44:04.558
Who buys the food
Who buys the drinks

44:04.726 --> 44:07.978
Who thinks that dough was made to spend
And acts the way he thinks

44:08.146 --> 44:10.856
Now is it, Joe, no, no, no

44:11.566 --> 44:14.192
Bernstein, these men
who are now with the Inquirer...

44:14.360 --> 44:16.987
...who were with the Chronicle
until yesterday...

44:17.155 --> 44:18.572
Oh, mama, please.

44:18.740 --> 44:20.449
- Give me that.
- What? The blond?

44:20.616 --> 44:24.077
- No, the brunette.
- Where did you learn that, Charlie?

44:25.371 --> 44:28.498
Bernstein, these men
who were with the Chronicle...

44:28.666 --> 44:31.668
...weren't they just as devoted
to the Chronicle policy...

44:31.836 --> 44:34.004
...as they are now to our policies?

44:34.172 --> 44:36.882
Sure, they're just like anybody else.

44:37.091 --> 44:39.176
They got work to do, they do it.

44:39.469 --> 44:42.429
Only they happen to be the best men
in the business.

44:50.772 --> 44:55.108
Do we stand for the same things
the Chronicle stands for?

44:55.276 --> 44:57.069
Certainly not.

44:58.071 --> 45:03.116
Listen, Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed
to his kind of newspapermen in a week.

45:03.284 --> 45:07.621
There's always a chance, of course,
that they'll change Mr. Kane.

45:07.789 --> 45:09.164
Without his knowing it.

45:12.668 --> 45:16.254
Mr. Leland, I got a cable from Mr. Kane!

45:17.298 --> 45:21.301
- Mr. Leland! I got a cable from Mr. Kane.
- What?

45:21.469 --> 45:23.345
- From Paris, France.
- What?

45:23.513 --> 45:26.473
- From Paris, France.
- Come on in.

45:27.392 --> 45:32.312
Who by his action
Has the traction magnates on the run

45:32.647 --> 45:37.692
It's a good thing he promised
not to send back any more statues.

45:37.860 --> 45:38.944
Bernstein, Bernstein.

45:39.112 --> 45:41.780
Look, he wants to buy
the world's biggest diamond.

45:41.948 --> 45:45.409
Why didn't you go to Europe with him?
He wanted you to.

45:45.576 --> 45:48.078
I wanted Charlie to have fun,
with me along...

45:48.246 --> 45:50.372
Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt?

45:50.540 --> 45:55.419
Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?
Am I a New England schoolmarm?

45:56.170 --> 45:57.504
Yes.

45:58.756 --> 46:03.260
If you thought I'd answer you different
from what Mr. Kane tells you, I wouldn't.

46:03.428 --> 46:04.761
"World's biggest diamond."

46:04.929 --> 46:07.013
I didn't know Charlie
was collecting diamonds.

46:07.181 --> 46:08.348
He ain't.

46:08.516 --> 46:12.144
He's collecting somebody
that's collecting diamonds.

46:12.603 --> 46:15.689
Anyway, he ain't only collecting statues.

46:17.775 --> 46:19.818
"Welcome home, Mr. Kane...

46:19.986 --> 46:23.655
...from 467 employees
of the New York Inquirer."

46:23.823 --> 46:25.323
Here he comes!

46:29.370 --> 46:31.163
Welcome, Mr. Kane.

46:31.956 --> 46:33.707
- I know I've a mustache.
- It looks awful.

46:33.875 --> 46:37.377
Have we got a society editor?

46:37.545 --> 46:40.380
- Right here, Mr. Kane.
- Miss Townsend is the society editor.

46:40.548 --> 46:43.216
Miss Townsend,
this is Mr. Charles Foster Kane.

46:43.426 --> 46:48.555
Uh... Miss Townsend, I've been away
so long. I don't know your routine.

46:49.682 --> 46:52.726
I got a little social announcement.

46:52.894 --> 46:56.897
I wish you wouldn't treat it
any differently than you would any other...

46:57.064 --> 46:58.732
...social announcement.

46:59.358 --> 47:02.360
Mr. Kane, on behalf of all the employees
of the Inquirer...

47:02.528 --> 47:06.031
Mr. Bernstein,
thank you very much, everybody, I...

47:06.908 --> 47:11.036
I'm sorry, I can't accept it now.

47:11.204 --> 47:12.662
Goodbye.

47:13.331 --> 47:15.540
Say, he was in an awful hurry.

47:15.708 --> 47:18.585
Hey, everybody, look out here.

47:18.753 --> 47:20.712
Let's go to the window.

47:20.922 --> 47:23.757
- Mr. Leland! Mr. Bernstein!
- Yes, Ms. Townsend?

47:23.925 --> 47:26.718
"Mr. And Mrs. Thomas Monroe Norton..."

47:26.886 --> 47:30.347
...announce the engagement
of their daughter, Emily Monroe Norton...

47:30.515 --> 47:32.182
...to Mr. Charles Foster Kane."
Huh?

47:32.350 --> 47:33.850
Come on.

47:36.020 --> 47:41.066
Emily Monroe Norton, she's the niece
of the President of the United States.

47:41.234 --> 47:43.318
President's niece?

47:43.528 --> 47:46.071
Before he's through,
she'll be a president's wife.

47:54.956 --> 47:58.291
The way things turned out,
I don't need to tell you.

47:58.459 --> 48:01.211
Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud.

48:01.379 --> 48:03.630
It didn't end very well, did it?

48:03.798 --> 48:05.423
It ended.

48:06.217 --> 48:10.011
Then there was Susie. That ended too.

48:12.056 --> 48:14.975
You know, Mr. Thompson,
I was thinking...

48:15.476 --> 48:18.436
...this Rosebud
you're trying to find out about...

48:19.647 --> 48:20.981
Yes?

48:25.403 --> 48:27.821
Maybe that was something he lost.

48:28.656 --> 48:31.992
Mr. Kane was a man who lost
almost everything he had.

48:32.660 --> 48:34.869
You ought to see Jed Leland.

48:35.037 --> 48:38.164
Of course, he and Mr. Kane
didn't exactly see eye to eye.

48:38.332 --> 48:40.208
You take the Spanish-American war.

48:40.376 --> 48:43.670
I guess Mr. Leland was right.
That was Mr. Kane's war.

48:43.838 --> 48:46.798
We didn't really have anything
to fight about.

48:47.550 --> 48:51.177
Do you think if it hadn't been for that war
of Mr. Kane's...

48:51.470 --> 48:54.222
...we'd have the Panama Canal?

48:54.849 --> 48:57.350
I wish I knew where Mr. Leland was.

48:57.977 --> 49:01.146
A lot of the time now
they don't tell me these things.

49:02.440 --> 49:04.232
Maybe even he's dead.

49:04.400 --> 49:06.026
In case you'd like to know...

49:06.193 --> 49:09.070
...he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital
on 180th Street.

49:09.238 --> 49:10.655
You don't say. I had...

49:10.823 --> 49:13.617
Nothing particular the matter with him,
they tell me, just...

49:13.784 --> 49:16.369
Just old age.

49:17.663 --> 49:22.542
It's the only disease that you don't
look forward to being cured of.

49:34.680 --> 49:37.474
I can remember absolutely everything,
young man.

49:37.642 --> 49:38.850
That's my curse.

49:39.018 --> 49:43.563
That's one of the greatest curses
Memory.

49:44.523 --> 49:49.361
I was his oldest friend, and as far as
I was concerned, he behaved like a swine.

49:49.570 --> 49:53.698
Not that Charlie was ever brutal.
He just did brutal things.

49:54.450 --> 49:58.745
Maybe I wasn't his friend,
but if I wasn't, he never had one.

49:58.996 --> 50:02.540
Maybe I was what you nowadays
call a stooge.

50:02.708 --> 50:04.959
You were about to say
something about Rosebud.

50:05.127 --> 50:07.253
Do you happen to have a good cigar?

50:07.421 --> 50:11.216
I've got a young physician here
who thinks I'm going to give up smoking.

50:11.384 --> 50:13.802
- No, I'm afraid I haven't. Sorry.
- Oh, oh. Ha, ha.

50:13.969 --> 50:15.595
I changed the subject, didn't I?

50:15.763 --> 50:17.889
What a disagreeable old man
I have become.

50:19.266 --> 50:24.437
You're a reporter and you want to know
what I think about Charlie Kane.

50:24.939 --> 50:27.273
Well... Heh.

50:27.441 --> 50:29.901
I suppose he had some private sort
of greatness.

50:30.069 --> 50:31.695
But he kept it to himself.

50:31.862 --> 50:34.739
He never gave himself away.
He never gave anything away.

50:34.907 --> 50:37.867
He just left you a tip.

50:38.035 --> 50:40.662
Hmm? Heh. He had a generous mind.

50:40.830 --> 50:43.998
I don't suppose anybody
ever had so many opinions.

50:44.291 --> 50:46.960
But he never believed in anything
except Charlie Kane.

50:47.128 --> 50:50.714
He never had a conviction
except Charlie Kane in his life.

50:50.965 --> 50:53.174
I suppose he died without one.

50:53.342 --> 50:55.969
That must have been pretty unpleasant.

50:56.303 --> 51:00.890
Of course, a lot of us check out without
having any special convictions about death.

51:01.058 --> 51:04.310
But we do know what we're leaving.
We do believe in something.

51:04.979 --> 51:07.981
Are you absolutely sure
you haven't got a cigar?

51:08.149 --> 51:10.108
- Sorry, Mr. Leland.
- Never mind.

51:10.276 --> 51:13.653
- What do you know about Rosebud?
- "Rosebud"?

51:13.821 --> 51:18.074
"Rosebud."

51:18.409 --> 51:20.493
I saw that in the Inquirer.

51:21.495 --> 51:24.456
I never believed anything
I saw in the Inquirer.

51:24.623 --> 51:25.957
Anything else?

51:26.125 --> 51:29.794
I can tell you about Emily.
I went to dancing school with Emily.

51:30.171 --> 51:31.963
I was very graceful.

51:32.923 --> 51:36.217
- We were talking about the first Mrs. Kane.
- What was she like?

51:36.385 --> 51:38.845
She was like all the girls I knew
in dancing school.

51:39.013 --> 51:41.723
Very nice girl. Emily was a little nicer.

51:43.476 --> 51:45.477
After the first couple of months...

51:45.644 --> 51:49.898
...she and Charlie didn't see much
of each other except at breakfast.

51:50.566 --> 51:53.234
It was a marriage
just like any other marriage.

52:03.454 --> 52:05.079
- You're beautiful.
- I can't be.

52:05.247 --> 52:06.915
Yes, you are. You're very beautiful.

52:07.082 --> 52:09.626
I've never been to six parties
in one night before.

52:09.877 --> 52:12.545
- I've never been up this late.
- It's a matter of habit.

52:12.713 --> 52:15.590
- What will the servants think?
- That we enjoyed ourselves.

52:15.758 --> 52:18.218
Why do you have to go straight off
to the newspaper?

52:18.385 --> 52:22.055
You never should've married a
newspaperman, they're worse than sailors.

52:22.973 --> 52:24.891
I absolutely adore you.

52:25.726 --> 52:28.645
Charles, even newspapermen
have to sleep.

52:30.105 --> 52:33.942
I'll call Mr. Bernstein and have him
put off my appointments till noon.

52:34.902 --> 52:36.402
What time is it?

52:36.570 --> 52:38.530
I don't know. It's late.

52:40.616 --> 52:42.575
It's early.

52:42.743 --> 52:44.410
Charles...

52:44.995 --> 52:47.914
Do you know how long
you kept me waiting last night...

52:48.082 --> 52:50.875
...when you went to the newspaper
for 10 minutes?

52:51.085 --> 52:54.254
What do you do in a newspaper
in the middle of the night?

52:54.421 --> 52:59.384
My dear, your only correspondent
is the Inquirer.

52:59.552 --> 53:02.262
Sometimes I think I'd prefer a rival
of flesh and blood.

53:02.429 --> 53:04.889
I don't spend that much time
on the newspaper.

53:05.057 --> 53:09.060
It isn't just the time.
It's what you print, attacking the president.

53:09.228 --> 53:12.355
- You mean Uncle John.
- I mean the president of the United States.

53:12.523 --> 53:14.899
He's still Uncle John
and a well-meaning fathead...

53:15.067 --> 53:18.361
...who's letting a pack of high-pressure
crooks run his administration.

53:18.529 --> 53:22.240
- This whole oil scandal...
- He happens to be the president, not you.

53:22.408 --> 53:25.118
That's a mistake that will be corrected
one of these days.

53:25.286 --> 53:31.207
Your Mr. Bernstein sent Junior
the most incredible atrocity yesterday.

53:31.375 --> 53:34.210
I simply can't have it in the nursery.

53:36.297 --> 53:39.257
Mr. Bernstein is apt to pay a visit
to the nursery now and then.

53:39.425 --> 53:40.925
Does he have to?

53:42.303 --> 53:43.344
Yes.

53:43.512 --> 53:48.308
- Really, Charles, people will think...
- What I tell them to think.

54:06.744 --> 54:08.786
Wasn't he ever in love with her?

54:08.954 --> 54:10.705
He married for love.

54:11.624 --> 54:12.999
Love.

54:13.667 --> 54:15.335
That is why he did everything.

54:15.502 --> 54:18.338
That's why he went into politics.
It seems we weren't enough.

54:18.505 --> 54:21.549
He wanted all the voters to love him too.

54:22.217 --> 54:25.219
All he wanted out of life was love.

54:25.554 --> 54:28.806
That's Charlie's story. How he lost it.

54:29.016 --> 54:32.685
You see, he just didn't have any to give.

54:33.187 --> 54:35.396
He loved Charlie Kane, of course.

54:36.774 --> 54:38.024
Very dearly.

54:38.734 --> 54:40.902
And his mother,
I guess he always loved her.

54:41.070 --> 54:44.113
- How about his second wife?
- Susan Alexander?

54:44.865 --> 54:47.033
You know what Charlie called her?

54:47.242 --> 54:50.036
The day after he'd met her,
he told me about her.

54:50.204 --> 54:54.958
He said she was
"a cross-section of the American public."

54:57.336 --> 55:00.922
I guess he couldn't help it.
She must have had something for him.

55:01.090 --> 55:03.883
That first night, according to Charlie...

55:04.927 --> 55:07.595
...all she had was a toothache.

55:38.502 --> 55:40.878
What are you laughing at, young lady?

55:41.380 --> 55:42.588
Ooh.

55:42.756 --> 55:45.425
- What's the matter with you?
- Toothache.

55:45.592 --> 55:47.260
- What?
- Toothache.

55:47.428 --> 55:48.761
Toothache?

55:50.097 --> 55:52.015
Oh. Oh.

55:52.182 --> 55:53.474
You mean you've got a toothache.

55:55.102 --> 55:57.937
- What's funny about that?
- You're funny, mister.

55:58.105 --> 56:00.606
- You've got dirt on your face.
- Not dirt, it's mud.

56:00.774 --> 56:02.984
Do you want some hot water?
I live right here.

56:03.152 --> 56:05.111
What's that, young lady?

56:06.363 --> 56:08.781
I said, if you wanted some hot water...

56:09.116 --> 56:11.117
...I could get you some...

56:12.119 --> 56:13.745
...hot water.

56:16.874 --> 56:19.167
All right, thank you very much.

56:33.515 --> 56:35.433
Do I look any better now?

56:35.601 --> 56:40.313
- This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
- What you need is to get your mind off it.

56:40.606 --> 56:42.023
Hey.

56:45.486 --> 56:48.613
Excuse me, but my landlady
prefers me to keep this door open...

56:48.822 --> 56:51.282
...when I have a gentleman caller.
All right.

56:51.450 --> 56:53.951
- Oh.
- You have got a toothache, haven't you?

56:54.119 --> 56:57.080
- I surely have.
- Why don't you try laughing at me again?

56:57.247 --> 56:59.123
- What?
- I'm still pretty funny.

56:59.291 --> 57:01.793
I know, but you don't want me
to laugh at you.

57:01.960 --> 57:03.920
- I don't want your tooth to hurt, either.
- Ooh.

57:04.088 --> 57:05.338
Look at me.

57:05.798 --> 57:07.924
- See that?
- What are you doing?

57:08.092 --> 57:10.885
I'm wiggling both my ears
at the same time.

57:13.055 --> 57:14.263
That's it, smile.

57:17.518 --> 57:21.312
It took me two solid years at the best
boys' school in the world to learn that.

57:21.480 --> 57:24.315
The fellow who taught me
is now president of Venezuela.

57:26.568 --> 57:27.735
That's it!

57:31.824 --> 57:34.450
- Is it a giraffe?
- No, not a giraffe.

57:34.618 --> 57:37.328
- I bet it is.
- What?

57:37.496 --> 57:39.580
Well, then it's an elephant.

57:39.748 --> 57:43.709
- It's supposed to be a rooster.
- A rooster!

57:43.877 --> 57:47.755
You know an awful lot of tricks.
Are you a professional magician?

57:47.923 --> 57:50.424
- No, I'm not a magician.
- I was just joking.

57:50.592 --> 57:52.176
You really don't know who I am?

57:52.344 --> 57:55.346
You told me your name, Mr. Kane,
but I'm awfully ignorant.

57:55.514 --> 57:59.976
I guess you caught on to that.
I bet I've heard your name a million times.

58:00.144 --> 58:03.187
You really like me though,
even though you don't know who I am?

58:03.355 --> 58:06.774
I surely do. You've been wonderful.

58:07.860 --> 58:10.528
Without you I don't know
what I would have done.

58:10.696 --> 58:13.990
I had a toothache,
and I don't know many people.

58:14.283 --> 58:16.200
I know too many people.

58:16.618 --> 58:18.661
I guess we're both lonely.

58:18.954 --> 58:22.874
Want to know what I was going to do
before I ruined my best Sunday clothes?

58:23.041 --> 58:26.210
I bet they're not your best Sunday clothes.
You probably have more.

58:26.378 --> 58:27.545
I was just joking.

58:29.256 --> 58:33.134
I was on my way
to the Western Manhattan Warehouse...

58:33.302 --> 58:35.303
...in search of my youth.

58:36.388 --> 58:40.933
You see, my mother died a long time ago.
Her things were put in storage out West.

58:41.101 --> 58:43.477
There wasn't any other place
to put them.

58:43.645 --> 58:47.607
I thought I'd send for them now.
Tonight I was going to take a look at them.

58:47.774 --> 58:49.525
A sort of sentimental journey.

58:53.572 --> 58:55.698
I run a couple of newspapers.
What do you do?

58:55.866 --> 58:57.200
- Me?
- Mm-hm.

58:57.367 --> 58:59.452
- How old did you say you were?
- I didn't say.

58:59.620 --> 59:02.205
If you had, I wouldn't have asked you.

59:02.372 --> 59:03.539
- How old?
- Pretty old.

59:03.707 --> 59:05.708
- How old?
- Twenty-two in August.

59:05.876 --> 59:07.793
That's a ripe old age. What do you do?

59:07.961 --> 59:11.422
I work at Seligman's.
I'm in charge of the sheet music.

59:11.673 --> 59:16.802
- Is that what you want to do?
- No, I wanted to be a singer, I guess.

59:16.970 --> 59:20.556
- That is, I didn't. My mother did for me.
- What happened to the singing?

59:20.724 --> 59:24.644
Mother always thought... She always talked
about grand opera for me.

59:24.811 --> 59:26.020
Imagine.

59:26.313 --> 59:30.524
But my voice isn't that kind.
It's just, you know what mothers are like.

59:32.319 --> 59:33.527
Yes, I know.

59:35.572 --> 59:37.782
- Have you got a piano?
- A piano?

59:37.950 --> 59:40.952
- Mm-hm.
- Yes, there's one in the parlor.

59:41.119 --> 59:44.205
- Would you sing for me?
- You wouldn't want to hear me sing.

59:44.373 --> 59:45.748
Yes, I would.

59:47.668 --> 59:49.710
Don't tell me
your toothache is bothering you.

59:49.878 --> 59:51.587
No, that's all gone.

59:53.340 --> 59:55.299
All right.

59:56.260 --> 59:57.969
Let's go to the parlor.

59:58.512 --> 01:00:05.142
Yes, Lindor shall be mine

01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:09.438
I have sworn it

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:14.568
For weal or woe

01:00:14.736 --> 01:00:21.742
Yes, Lindor

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:43.222
There is only one man
who can rid the politics...

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:46.559
...of this state of the evil domination
of Boss Jim Gettys.

01:00:46.727 --> 01:00:50.563
I am speaking of Charles Foster Kane,
the fighting liberal...

01:00:50.731 --> 01:00:54.191
...the friend of the workingman,
the next governor of this state...

01:00:54.359 --> 01:00:56.569
...who entered upon this campaign...

01:00:58.739 --> 01:01:03.075
To point out
and make public the dishonesty...

01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:08.080
...the downright villainy
of Boss Jim W. Gettys' political machine...

01:01:08.415 --> 01:01:12.752
...now in complete control
of the government of this state.

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:16.922
I made no campaign promises...

01:01:17.424 --> 01:01:22.219
...because, until a few weeks ago,
I had no hope of being elected.

01:01:23.722 --> 01:01:27.308
Now, however, I have something more
than a hope.

01:01:29.353 --> 01:01:33.856
Jim Gettys has something less
than a chance.

01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:39.945
Every straw vote...

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:44.950
...every independent poll shows
that I will be elected.

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:47.119
Very well.

01:01:47.287 --> 01:01:49.955
Now I can afford to make some promises.

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:03.928
The workingman and the slum child...

01:02:04.096 --> 01:02:07.640
...know they can expect
my best efforts in their interests.

01:02:07.808 --> 01:02:12.311
The decent, ordinary citizens know
that I'll do everything in my power...

01:02:12.479 --> 01:02:17.650
...to protect the underprivileged,
the underpaid, and the underfed.

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:25.950
- Mother, is Pop governor yet?
- Not yet, Junior.

01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:33.165
I'd make my promises now...

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:36.961
...if I weren't too busy
arranging to keep them.

01:02:41.508 --> 01:02:44.510
But here's one promise I'll make...

01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:48.097
...and Boss Jim Gettys knows I'll keep it.

01:02:48.974 --> 01:02:51.809
My first official act
as governor of this state...

01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:57.064
...will be to appoint a special district
attorney to arrange for the indictment...

01:02:57.315 --> 01:03:02.611
...prosecution and conviction
of Boss Jim W. Gettys.

01:03:29.222 --> 01:03:32.391
If the election were held today,
you'd be in by 100,000 votes.

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:34.268
- Gettys isn't even pretending.
- Pop.

01:03:34.436 --> 01:03:36.562
- Hello, son.
- He isn't just scared, he's sick.

01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:39.440
It's beginning to dawn on Jim Gettys
I mean what I say.

01:03:39.608 --> 01:03:42.902
- Did you like your old man's speech?
- I could hear every word.

01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:44.862
- Hello, Emily.
- Hold it.

01:03:45.238 --> 01:03:47.448
- Great speech, Mr. Kane.
- Wonderful.

01:03:47.616 --> 01:03:51.327
- Will you get us a taxi?
- A taxi? Why? I thought...

01:03:51.703 --> 01:03:54.830
I'm sending Junior home
in the car with Oliver.

01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:56.499
Good night, Father.

01:03:57.918 --> 01:03:59.418
Goodbye, son.

01:04:05.217 --> 01:04:06.634
Emily...

01:04:10.472 --> 01:04:13.724
Why did you send Junior home in the car?
What are you doing in a taxi?

01:04:13.892 --> 01:04:15.851
There's a call I want you to make
with me.

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:17.937
- It can wait.
- No, it can't.

01:04:18.104 --> 01:04:21.273
- What's this all about, Emily?
- It may not be about anything at all.

01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:22.983
I intend to find out.

01:04:23.151 --> 01:04:27.446
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to "185 West 74th Street."

01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:31.200
If you wish, you may come with me.

01:04:35.914 --> 01:04:37.623
I'll come with you.

01:04:42.629 --> 01:04:46.298
I had no idea you had this flair
for melodrama, Emily.

01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:49.843
Come right in, Mr. Kane.

01:05:00.188 --> 01:05:01.814
Charlie.

01:05:08.363 --> 01:05:11.532
He forced me to send your wife that letter.
I didn't want to.

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:14.493
He's been saying the most terrible...

01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:20.207
Mrs. Kane.

01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:24.712
I don't suppose
anybody would introduce us.

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:27.756
I'm Jim Gettys.

01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:29.508
Yes?

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:36.432
I made Miss Alexander send you the note,
Mrs. Kane.

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.684
She didn't want to at first.
But she did it.

01:05:38.852 --> 01:05:40.185
Charlie, the things he said to me.

01:05:40.353 --> 01:05:42.646
- He threatened to...
- Gettys.

01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:46.650
I won't wait until I'm elected.
To start with, I think I'll break your neck.

01:05:46.818 --> 01:05:49.445
Maybe you can do it,
and maybe you can't.

01:05:49.613 --> 01:05:54.742
Charles, your breaking this man's neck
would scarcely explain this note:

01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:59.496
"Serious consequences for Mr. Kane,
for yourself and for your son."

01:05:59.664 --> 01:06:02.583
- He wanted to get her to come here...
- What does this note mean?

01:06:02.751 --> 01:06:05.252
I'm Susan Alexander.
I know what you think...

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:08.172
- What does this note mean, Ms. Alexander?
- She don't know.

01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:11.050
She sent it because I told her
it wouldn't be smart not to.

01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:14.511
- Emily, this gentleman...
- I'm not a gentleman.

01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:17.556
Your husband is only trying to be funny
calling me one.

01:06:17.724 --> 01:06:20.267
I don't even know what a gentleman is.

01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:24.563
You see, my idea of a gentleman... Heh.

01:06:27.734 --> 01:06:31.111
If I owned a paper and didn't like
the way somebody was doing things...

01:06:31.279 --> 01:06:33.614
...some politician,
I'd fight him with all I had.

01:06:33.782 --> 01:06:35.532
I wouldn't show him in a convict suit...

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.951
...so his children could see
his picture in the paper.

01:06:38.119 --> 01:06:42.039
- You're a cheap, crooked grafter...
- We're talking now about what you are.

01:06:42.957 --> 01:06:45.751
I'm fighting for my life,
not just my political life.

01:06:45.919 --> 01:06:48.003
- He said unless you...
- That's what I said.

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:52.091
Here's the chance I'm willing to give him.
It's more of a chance than he'd give me.

01:06:52.258 --> 01:06:56.929
Unless he decides by tomorrow that he's
so sick he has to go away for a year...

01:06:57.097 --> 01:07:01.266
...Monday morning, all papers in the state,
except his, will carry the story I'll give.

01:07:01.434 --> 01:07:02.810
What story?

01:07:03.603 --> 01:07:06.730
- The story about him and Ms. Alexander.
- There isn't any story!

01:07:06.898 --> 01:07:08.107
Shut up.

01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:11.193
We've got evidence that would look bad
in the headlines.

01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:13.987
Do you want me
to give you the evidence?

01:07:16.116 --> 01:07:18.867
I'd rather he withdrew
without having the story published.

01:07:19.035 --> 01:07:22.079
Not that I care about him,
but I'd be better off that way.

01:07:24.999 --> 01:07:27.126
So would you, Mrs. Kane.

01:07:27.502 --> 01:07:29.586
What about me?

01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:35.342
He said my name would be dragged
through the mud. That everywhere I went...

01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:38.721
There seems to be only one decision
you can make, Charles.

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:41.140
I'd say that it'd been made for you.

01:07:42.809 --> 01:07:44.893
You can't tell me the voters
of this state...

01:07:45.145 --> 01:07:47.855
I'm not interested in the voters
of this state right now.

01:07:48.022 --> 01:07:49.398
I am interested in our son.

01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:52.693
- Charlie, if they publish this story...
- They won't.

01:07:53.987 --> 01:07:56.155
Good night, Mr. Gettys.

01:08:05.623 --> 01:08:07.166
Are you coming, Charles?

01:08:09.377 --> 01:08:10.711
No.

01:08:14.132 --> 01:08:15.758
I'm staying here.

01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:21.013
I can fight this all alone.

01:08:22.223 --> 01:08:24.683
If you don't listen to reason,
it may be too late.

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:26.518
Too late?

01:08:28.145 --> 01:08:29.813
For what?

01:08:30.857 --> 01:08:34.151
For you and this public thief...

01:08:34.486 --> 01:08:36.737
...to take the love of the people
away from me?

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:39.615
You got other things to think about.
Your little boy.

01:08:39.783 --> 01:08:42.201
You don't want him to read about you
in the papers.

01:08:42.368 --> 01:08:46.872
There's only one person in the world
to decide what I'll do. And that's me.

01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:53.712
You decided what you were going to do,
Charles, some time ago.

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:03.095
You're making a bigger fool of yourself
than I thought.

01:09:03.264 --> 01:09:05.557
- I've got nothing to say to you.
- You're licked...

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:09.060
Get out. If you want to see me,
have the warden write me a letter.

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:13.982
If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going
to happen to you would be a lesson to you.

01:09:14.234 --> 01:09:16.944
Only you're going to need
more than one lesson.

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:21.823
- And you'll get more than one lesson.
- Don't worry about me, Gettys.

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:25.577
Don't worry about me!

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:29.081
I'm Charles Foster Kane!

01:09:29.624 --> 01:09:33.836
I'm no cheap, crooked politician
trying to save himself...

01:09:34.002 --> 01:09:37.005
...from the consequences of his crimes!

01:09:38.049 --> 01:09:42.094
Gettys! I'm gonna send you to Sing Sing.

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:46.305
Sing Sing, Gettys. Sing Sing!

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.685
- Have you a car, Mrs. Kane?
- Yes, thank you.

01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:53.981
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:10:04.784 --> 01:10:08.787
Paper. Read all about it. Extra, extra.

01:10:13.293 --> 01:10:15.377
- Paper?
- No, thanks.

01:10:30.268 --> 01:10:33.103
With a million majority
already against him...

01:10:33.354 --> 01:10:36.690
...and the church counties
still to be heard from...

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:39.276
...I'm afraid we got no choice.

01:10:39.444 --> 01:10:40.819
This one?

01:10:44.282 --> 01:10:46.033
That one.

01:11:09.349 --> 01:11:11.183
Good night again.

01:11:22.362 --> 01:11:26.406
- Is there anything I can...?
- No, thanks, Mr. Bernstein.

01:11:27.492 --> 01:11:29.785
You better go home and get some sleep.

01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:32.371
You too.

01:11:33.247 --> 01:11:34.581
Uh-huh.

01:11:34.749 --> 01:11:36.833
Good night, Mr. Kane.

01:12:01.693 --> 01:12:04.569
- Hello, Jedediah.
- I'm drunk.

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:13.537
If you've got drunk to talk to me about...

01:12:15.581 --> 01:12:18.125
...Ms. Alexander, don't bother.

01:12:19.961 --> 01:12:21.753
I'm not interested.

01:12:25.967 --> 01:12:30.137
I've set back the sacred cause of reform,
is that it?

01:12:31.305 --> 01:12:32.723
All right.

01:12:34.475 --> 01:12:37.728
If that's the way they want it,
the people have made their choice.

01:12:37.895 --> 01:12:40.689
It's obvious the people
prefer Jim Gettys to me.

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:44.359
You talk about the people
as though you owned them.

01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:47.320
As though they belong to you.
Goodness.

01:12:47.488 --> 01:12:52.325
As long as I can remember, you've talked
about giving the people their rights...

01:12:52.493 --> 01:12:55.704
...as if you could make them
a present of liberty...

01:12:55.872 --> 01:12:58.331
...as a reward for services rendered.

01:12:58.499 --> 01:13:01.293
- Jed.
- You remember the workingman?

01:13:01.461 --> 01:13:04.296
I'll get drunk too, Jedediah...

01:13:05.757 --> 01:13:06.965
...if it'll do any good.

01:13:07.133 --> 01:13:10.469
It won't do any good.
Besides you never get drunk.

01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:13.221
You used to write an awful lot
about the workingman...

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:14.514
Go on home.

01:13:14.682 --> 01:13:17.684
He's turning into something called
"organized labor."

01:13:19.145 --> 01:13:22.439
You won't like that one little bit
when you find out...

01:13:22.607 --> 01:13:27.694
...it means your workingman expects
something as his right, and not your gift.

01:13:29.781 --> 01:13:34.659
When your precious underprivileged
really get together...

01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:36.703
Oh, boy...

01:13:37.497 --> 01:13:40.415
That'll add up to something bigger
than your privilege...

01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:43.418
...then I don't know what you'll do.

01:13:43.586 --> 01:13:48.840
Sail away to a desert island probably
and lord it over the monkeys.

01:13:50.134 --> 01:13:52.302
I wouldn't worry about it too much.

01:13:52.678 --> 01:13:57.557
There'll probably be a few of them there
to tell me when I do something wrong.

01:13:57.767 --> 01:13:59.851
You may not always be so lucky.

01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:02.062
You're not very drunk.

01:14:02.230 --> 01:14:04.231
Drunk, what do you care?

01:14:04.649 --> 01:14:07.526
You don't care about anything
except you.

01:14:08.528 --> 01:14:14.366
You persuade people that you love them
so much that they ought to love you back.

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:17.327
Only you want love on your own terms.

01:14:19.038 --> 01:14:22.499
It's something to be played your way,
according to your rules.

01:14:29.132 --> 01:14:32.551
- Let me work on the Chicago paper.
- What?

01:14:32.718 --> 01:14:37.556
You said you were looking for someone
to do dramatic "crimitism," criticism.

01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:38.890
I am drunk.

01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:44.271
I want to go to Chicago.

01:14:45.231 --> 01:14:47.190
You're too valuable here.

01:14:49.235 --> 01:14:53.155
- There's nothing left for me to do...
- All right, you can go to Chicago.

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:54.865
Thank you.

01:14:55.616 --> 01:14:58.160
I guess I'd better try to get drunk anyway.

01:14:59.871 --> 01:15:02.289
I warn you, Jedediah,
you won't like Chicago.

01:15:02.456 --> 01:15:07.002
The wind comes off the lake, and they've
probably never heard of Lobster Newburg.

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:09.254
Will Saturday after next be all right?

01:15:09.422 --> 01:15:12.048
- Anytime you say.
- Thank you.

01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:22.434
A toast to love on my terms.
Those are the only terms anybody knows:

01:15:23.686 --> 01:15:25.145
His own.

01:15:37.825 --> 01:15:40.035
Mr. Kane, I'm from the Inquirer.

01:15:49.629 --> 01:15:52.464
- What's that, young man?
- Are you through with politics?

01:15:52.632 --> 01:15:56.218
Am I through with politics?
I should say vice versa.

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:58.345
We're going to be an opera star.

01:15:58.512 --> 01:16:00.305
Are you singing at the Metropolitan?

01:16:00.473 --> 01:16:01.806
We certainly are.

01:16:01.974 --> 01:16:04.809
Charlie said if I didn't,
he'd build me an opera house.

01:16:04.977 --> 01:16:06.853
That won't be necessary.

01:16:11.317 --> 01:16:12.651
No, no, no!

01:16:41.639 --> 01:16:43.682
Places, everybody!

01:16:48.187 --> 01:16:49.688
Places, please!

01:17:38.779 --> 01:17:41.531
Mr. Leland is writing it
from the dramatic angle?

01:17:41.699 --> 01:17:45.577
- We've covered it from the news end.
- And the social.

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:48.121
How about the music notice?

01:17:48.289 --> 01:17:50.206
Yes, it's already made up.

01:17:50.374 --> 01:17:53.460
Mr. Mowan wrote a swell review.

01:17:55.129 --> 01:17:57.213
- Enthusiastic?
- Yes, sir.

01:17:57.381 --> 01:17:58.923
- Naturally.
- Mr. Bernstein.

01:17:59.091 --> 01:18:01.968
- Mr. Kane.
- Mr. Kane. This is a surprise.

01:18:04.055 --> 01:18:05.972
We've got two spreads of pictures.

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:07.932
The music notice on the front page?

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:12.187
But there's still one notice to come.
The dramatic.

01:18:12.855 --> 01:18:14.647
The dramatic notice.

01:18:15.566 --> 01:18:20.653
- Mr. Bernstein, that's Mr. Leland, isn't it?
- Yes, we're waiting for it.

01:18:23.991 --> 01:18:27.077
- Where is he?
- Right in there, Mr. Kane.

01:18:35.086 --> 01:18:36.795
Mr. Kane...

01:18:39.465 --> 01:18:41.466
Mr. Kane...

01:18:51.268 --> 01:18:53.937
Mr. Leland and Mr. Kane...

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:58.691
...haven't spoken together for years.

01:19:00.945 --> 01:19:03.988
- You don't suppose...
- There's nothing to suppose.

01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:09.828
Excuse me.

01:19:26.345 --> 01:19:27.846
Close the door.

01:19:31.183 --> 01:19:34.102
He ain't been drinking before.

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:36.938
Never. We would have heard.

01:19:37.106 --> 01:19:39.023
What does it say there?

01:19:39.483 --> 01:19:42.277
The notice, what's he written?

01:19:43.863 --> 01:19:49.409
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty
but hopelessly incompetent amateur..."

01:19:52.371 --> 01:19:56.207
...last night opened
the new Chicago Opera House...

01:19:56.542 --> 01:19:58.543
"...in a performance of..."

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:05.467
I still can't pronounce that name.

01:20:08.429 --> 01:20:12.724
"Her singing, happily,
is no concern of this department.

01:20:12.892 --> 01:20:17.228
Of her acting,
it is absolutely impossible to..."

01:20:18.439 --> 01:20:19.898
Go on.

01:20:21.484 --> 01:20:24.068
- Go on.
- That's all there is.

01:20:37.166 --> 01:20:40.668
"Of her acting it is absolutely
impossible to say anything except...

01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:44.422
...that, in the opinion of this reviewer,
it represents a new low."

01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:47.425
- In the opinion of this reviewer.
- I didn't see that.

01:20:47.593 --> 01:20:49.886
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein,
I'm dictating it.

01:20:50.054 --> 01:20:52.931
- Mr. Kane, I...
- Get me a typewriter.

01:20:54.391 --> 01:20:57.060
I'm going to finish Mr. Leland's notice.

01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:16.079
Hello, Bernstein.

01:21:20.918 --> 01:21:23.336
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Leland.

01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:30.718
Where's my notice, Bernstein?
I've got to finish my notice.

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:34.556
- Mr. Kane is finishing it for you.
- Charlie?

01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:38.309
Charlie?

01:21:40.104 --> 01:21:42.438
Charlie out there?

01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:45.858
I guess he's fixing it up.

01:21:49.071 --> 01:21:51.864
I knew I'd never get that through.

01:21:52.324 --> 01:21:56.327
Mr. Kane's finishing your review
just the way you started it.

01:21:56.745 --> 01:22:00.957
He's writing a bad notice
like you wanted it to be.

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:05.336
I guess that'll show you.

01:22:29.862 --> 01:22:31.779
Hello, Jedediah.

01:22:35.034 --> 01:22:36.868
Hello, Charlie.

01:22:38.078 --> 01:22:40.538
I didn't know we were speaking.

01:22:41.248 --> 01:22:43.791
Sure we're speaking, Jedediah.

01:22:45.544 --> 01:22:47.712
You're fired.

01:23:00.017 --> 01:23:05.188
Everybody knows that story,
Mr. Leland, but why did he do it?

01:23:06.065 --> 01:23:09.192
- How could a man write a notice...
- You just don't know Charlie.

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:13.196
He thought that by finishing that notice
he'd show me he was an honest man.

01:23:13.364 --> 01:23:15.531
He was always
trying to prove something.

01:23:15.699 --> 01:23:18.743
That whole thing about Susie
being an opera singer.

01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:21.120
That was trying to prove something.

01:23:21.914 --> 01:23:25.249
You know what the headline was
the day before the election?

01:23:25.626 --> 01:23:31.464
"Candidate Kane
found in love nest with 'singer."'

01:23:31.632 --> 01:23:33.758
He was going to take
the quotes off the singer.

01:23:33.926 --> 01:23:35.009
Hey, nurse!

01:23:35.177 --> 01:23:39.222
Five years ago he wrote
from that place down there in the South.

01:23:39.390 --> 01:23:46.396
What's it called, Shangri-la? El Dorado?
Sloppy Joe's? What's the name?

01:23:48.107 --> 01:23:52.402
All right, Xanadu, I knew it all the time.

01:23:52.569 --> 01:23:56.656
You caught on, didn't you?
I'm not that hard to see through.

01:23:57.074 --> 01:23:59.450
Well, I never even answered his letter.

01:24:00.244 --> 01:24:01.577
Maybe I should have.

01:24:01.745 --> 01:24:05.790
I guess he was pretty lonely down there
in that coliseum all those years.

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:09.252
He hadn't finished it when she left him.
He never finished it.

01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:12.630
He never finished anything
except my notice.

01:24:12.965 --> 01:24:16.092
- Of course, he built the joint for her.
- That must have been love.

01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:17.510
I don't know.

01:24:17.678 --> 01:24:21.973
He was disappointed in the world
so he built his own, an absolute monarchy.

01:24:22.641 --> 01:24:25.143
It was something bigger
than an opera house anyway.

01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:26.644
- Nurse.
- Yes, Mr. Leland.

01:24:26.812 --> 01:24:28.146
I'm coming.

01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:33.151
- There's one thing you can do for me.
- Sure.

01:24:33.318 --> 01:24:37.697
Stop at the cigar store on your way out,
and get me a couple of good cigars.

01:24:37.865 --> 01:24:40.158
- Be glad to.
- Thank you.

01:24:40.617 --> 01:24:42.034
One is enough.

01:24:42.411 --> 01:24:46.664
When I was a young man, there was
an impression that nurses were pretty.

01:24:46.832 --> 01:24:48.916
Well, it was no truer
then than it is today.

01:24:49.084 --> 01:24:51.127
- I'll take your arm.
- All right.

01:24:51.295 --> 01:24:54.005
- You won't forget about those cigars?
- I won't.

01:24:54.173 --> 01:24:59.051
Have them wrapped like toothpaste,
or they'll stop them at the desk.

01:24:59.219 --> 01:25:02.013
You know that young doctor
I was telling you about, well...

01:25:02.181 --> 01:25:05.057
...he's got an idea
he wants to keep me alive.

01:25:35.339 --> 01:25:39.884
I'd rather you'd just talk.
Anything that comes into your mind...

01:25:40.052 --> 01:25:42.261
...about yourself and Mr. Kane.

01:25:42.471 --> 01:25:47.809
You don't want to hear what comes into
my mind about myself and Charlie Kane.

01:25:49.353 --> 01:25:54.148
You know, maybe I shouldn't have sung
for Charlie that first time I met him.

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:58.736
But I did an awful lot of singing
after that.

01:26:00.197 --> 01:26:03.991
I sang for teachers at $100 an hour.

01:26:04.159 --> 01:26:06.661
- The teachers got that, I didn't.
- What did you get?

01:26:06.829 --> 01:26:10.289
I didn't get a thing, except music lessons.
That's all there was in it.

01:26:10.457 --> 01:26:11.833
He married you, didn't he?

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.378
He didn't mention anything about marriage
until after it was over and...

01:26:15.546 --> 01:26:17.755
...until it got in the papers about us...

01:26:17.923 --> 01:26:22.802
...and he lost the election,
and that Norton woman divorced him.

01:26:23.136 --> 01:26:25.012
He was really interested in my voice.

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:26.764
Why did he build that opera house?

01:26:26.932 --> 01:26:30.768
I didn't want it. I didn't want a thing.
It was his idea.

01:26:32.145 --> 01:26:34.230
Everything was his idea...

01:26:37.192 --> 01:26:39.193
...except my leaving him.

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:48.619
Don't forget.

01:26:48.787 --> 01:26:51.789
Ta-ta-ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta-ta.

01:26:51.957 --> 01:26:53.416
Don't get nervous.

01:26:53.584 --> 01:26:56.210
Please. Let's come back.

01:26:57.796 --> 01:27:00.965
Look at me, Mrs. Kane, darling.

01:27:01.133 --> 01:27:03.175
Get the voice out of the throat

01:27:05.637 --> 01:27:10.057
Place the tone right in the mask

01:27:16.273 --> 01:27:17.982
Diaphragm.

01:27:25.115 --> 01:27:26.741
You're out of pitch.

01:27:31.163 --> 01:27:34.248
Some people can sing. Some can't.

01:27:34.416 --> 01:27:36.918
Impossible. Impossible!

01:27:37.085 --> 01:27:40.546
It's not your job to give your opinion
of Mrs. Kane's talents.

01:27:41.882 --> 01:27:45.509
You're supposed to train her voice,
Signor Matiste. Nothing more.

01:27:46.178 --> 01:27:47.887
Please continue with the lesson.

01:27:48.055 --> 01:27:50.473
- But, Mr. Kane.
- Please.

01:27:51.475 --> 01:27:55.269
I'll be the laughingstock
of the musical world. People will think...

01:27:55.437 --> 01:27:58.272
You're concerned what people will think?

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:02.860
Perhaps I can enlighten you a bit.
I'm an authority on what people will think.

01:28:03.028 --> 01:28:05.488
Heh. The newspapers for example.

01:28:05.739 --> 01:28:08.407
I run several newspapers
between here and San Francisco.

01:28:08.575 --> 01:28:09.992
It's all right, darling.

01:28:10.202 --> 01:28:12.703
Signor Matiste is going to listen
to reason.

01:28:13.372 --> 01:28:16.123
- How can I persuade you...
- You can't.

01:28:42.359 --> 01:28:44.485
It's all right, darling, go ahead.

01:28:56.248 --> 01:28:59.000
I thought you'd see it my way.

01:29:09.678 --> 01:29:12.430
No, no, no.

01:29:22.065 --> 01:29:24.525
Places! Places!

01:29:31.616 --> 01:29:34.160
Places! Places, everybody!

01:30:59.329 --> 01:31:00.704
I think it's dreadful.

01:32:40.222 --> 01:32:45.309
- Stop telling me he's your friend.
- A friend don't write that kind of review.

01:32:45.477 --> 01:32:48.562
All these other papers panning me,
I could expect that.

01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:52.524
But for the Inquirerto run a thing
like that, spoiling my whole debut.

01:32:52.692 --> 01:32:54.401
- Come in.
- I'll get it.

01:32:54.569 --> 01:32:57.363
Friend. Not the kind of friends I know...

01:32:57.656 --> 01:32:59.907
...but I'm not high class like you.

01:33:00.075 --> 01:33:01.909
And I never went to any swell schools.

01:33:02.077 --> 01:33:03.410
That'll be enough, Susan.

01:33:03.578 --> 01:33:05.162
- From Mr. Leland, sir.
- Jed Leland?

01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:08.457
He wanted me to make sure
you got this personally.

01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:11.377
Is that something from him?

01:33:12.837 --> 01:33:14.338
Charlie!

01:33:14.839 --> 01:33:18.676
As for you,
you ought to have your head examined.

01:33:18.885 --> 01:33:21.387
Sending him a letter
telling him he's fired...

01:33:21.554 --> 01:33:23.973
...with a $25,000 check in it.

01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:27.017
What kind of firing do you call that?

01:33:27.310 --> 01:33:31.563
You did send him a check for $25,000,
didn't you?

01:33:32.857 --> 01:33:34.149
Yes.

01:33:36.361 --> 01:33:39.571
I sent him a check for $25,000.

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:43.659
What's that?

01:33:44.869 --> 01:33:46.328
Declaration of Principles.

01:33:46.663 --> 01:33:48.914
- What? What is it?
- Hmm?

01:33:55.171 --> 01:33:59.550
- An antique.
- You're awful funny, aren't you?

01:34:00.093 --> 01:34:04.346
I'll tell you one thing you're not going
to be funny about, and that's my singing.

01:34:04.514 --> 01:34:08.225
I'm through.
I never wanted to do it in the first place.

01:34:08.727 --> 01:34:10.769
You'll continue with your singing, Susan.

01:34:10.937 --> 01:34:13.897
I don't propose
to have myself made ridiculous.

01:34:14.065 --> 01:34:17.484
You don't propose
to have yourself made ridiculous!

01:34:17.652 --> 01:34:20.904
What about me?
I'm the one that has to sing.

01:34:21.072 --> 01:34:24.616
I'm the one that gets the raspberries.
Why don't you leave me alone?

01:34:24.784 --> 01:34:26.577
My reasons satisfy me, Susan.

01:34:26.745 --> 01:34:28.912
You seem unable to understand them.

01:34:29.789 --> 01:34:32.041
I will not tell them to you again.

01:34:35.712 --> 01:34:37.921
You'll continue with your singing.

01:36:10.348 --> 01:36:12.182
Get Dr. Corey.

01:36:16.604 --> 01:36:18.021
Susan.

01:36:18.565 --> 01:36:22.192
She'll be perfectly all right
in a day or two, Mr. Kane.

01:36:24.195 --> 01:36:28.240
I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane
came to make such a foolish mistake.

01:36:28.741 --> 01:36:33.328
The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her
was in a somewhat larger bottle.

01:36:33.705 --> 01:36:38.125
The strain of preparing for the new opera
has excited and confused her.

01:36:38.293 --> 01:36:40.502
Yes, I'm sure that was it.

01:36:41.296 --> 01:36:44.047
No objections to my staying
with her, are there?

01:36:44.215 --> 01:36:48.302
No, not at all.
I'd like the nurse to be here too.

01:36:49.095 --> 01:36:51.221
Good night, Mr. Kane.

01:37:26.758 --> 01:37:28.383
Charlie.

01:37:31.095 --> 01:37:34.264
I couldn't make you see
how I felt, Charlie.

01:37:35.725 --> 01:37:38.477
But I couldn't go through
with the singing again.

01:37:40.396 --> 01:37:43.607
You don't know what it means
to know that people are...

01:37:45.109 --> 01:37:47.945
That the whole audience
doesn't want you.

01:37:51.533 --> 01:37:53.617
That's when you got to fight them.

01:38:02.043 --> 01:38:03.627
All right.

01:38:05.547 --> 01:38:07.965
You won't have to fight them anymore.

01:38:11.261 --> 01:38:12.803
It's their loss.

01:38:29.028 --> 01:38:30.821
What are you doing?

01:38:35.243 --> 01:38:37.244
Jigsaw puzzles?

01:38:42.375 --> 01:38:44.459
Charlie, what time is it?

01:38:44.961 --> 01:38:48.046
- 11:30.
- In New York?

01:38:49.549 --> 01:38:53.802
- Hmm?
- I said what time is it in New York?

01:38:54.637 --> 01:38:57.764
- 11:30.
- Night?

01:38:58.933 --> 01:39:00.392
Mm-hm.

01:39:01.352 --> 01:39:03.145
The Bulldog's just gone to press.

01:39:03.313 --> 01:39:06.481
Well, hurray for the Bulldog.

01:39:08.693 --> 01:39:12.070
Gee, 11:30. Shows are just getting out.

01:39:12.238 --> 01:39:14.990
People are going to nightclubs
and restaurants.

01:39:15.658 --> 01:39:18.994
Of course, we're different
because we live in a palace.

01:39:19.162 --> 01:39:21.705
You always said you wanted
to live in a palace.

01:39:21.873 --> 01:39:24.207
A person could go crazy in this dump.

01:39:24.375 --> 01:39:27.419
Nobody to talk to,
nobody to have any fun with.

01:39:27.587 --> 01:39:28.754
Susan.

01:39:28.921 --> 01:39:32.841
49,000 acres of nothing
but scenery and statues.

01:39:33.051 --> 01:39:34.468
I'm lonesome.

01:39:34.636 --> 01:39:38.472
Until yesterday, we've had no less
than 50 of your friends at any one time.

01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:41.266
I think if you look in the west wing...

01:39:41.434 --> 01:39:44.436
...you'll find about a dozen vacationists
still in residence.

01:39:44.604 --> 01:39:47.189
You make a joke out of everything.

01:39:47.690 --> 01:39:52.235
Charlie, I want to go to New York.
I'm tired of being a hostess.

01:39:52.403 --> 01:39:56.239
I want to have fun. Please, Charlie.

01:39:57.950 --> 01:40:00.786
Charlie, please.

01:40:01.746 --> 01:40:04.623
Our home is here, Susan.

01:40:10.129 --> 01:40:12.381
I don't care to visit New York.

01:40:49.293 --> 01:40:51.086
What are you doing?

01:40:53.172 --> 01:40:57.300
Oh. One thing I can never understand:

01:40:57.468 --> 01:40:59.553
How do you know
you haven't done it before?

01:40:59.721 --> 01:41:03.306
It makes a whole lot more sense
than collecting statues.

01:41:05.309 --> 01:41:06.893
You may be right.

01:41:07.311 --> 01:41:09.396
I sometimes wonder...

01:41:09.772 --> 01:41:12.149
...but you get into the habit.

01:41:12.316 --> 01:41:15.152
It's not a habit, I do
it because I like it.

01:41:15.653 --> 01:41:17.279
I thought we might have
a picnic tomorrow.

01:41:17.447 --> 01:41:18.488
Huh?

01:41:18.656 --> 01:41:20.365
I thought we might have
a picnic tomorrow.

01:41:20.533 --> 01:41:23.577
Invite everybody to spend the night
at the Everglades.

01:41:23.828 --> 01:41:28.165
Invite everybody. Order everybody,
you mean, and make them sleep in tents.

01:41:28.332 --> 01:41:31.209
Who wants to sleep in tents
when they've got their own room...

01:41:31.377 --> 01:41:33.920
...with a bath, where they know
where everything is?

01:41:34.088 --> 01:41:37.466
I thought we might have
a picnic tomorrow.

01:41:40.803 --> 01:41:45.140
You never give me anything
I really care about.

01:41:53.357 --> 01:41:57.861
It can't be love

01:41:58.029 --> 01:42:02.616
For there is no true love

01:42:02.784 --> 01:42:05.494
I know I've played at the game

01:42:05.661 --> 01:42:08.121
Like a moth in a blue flame

01:42:08.289 --> 01:42:12.209
Lost in the end Just the same

01:42:12.376 --> 01:42:15.045
All these years

01:42:15.213 --> 01:42:20.050
My heart's been floating around
In a puddle of tears

01:42:20.218 --> 01:42:24.221
Mm I wonder what it is

01:42:24.555 --> 01:42:28.558
Sure, you give me things,
but that don't mean anything to you.

01:42:30.978 --> 01:42:34.022
You're in a tent, darling,
you aren't at home.

01:42:34.190 --> 01:42:37.442
I can hear you very well
if you speak in a normal tone of voice.

01:42:37.610 --> 01:42:41.446
What's the difference between giving me
a bracelet or giving someone $100,000...

01:42:41.614 --> 01:42:44.574
...for a statue you'll keep crated up
and never look at?

01:42:44.742 --> 01:42:47.035
It's just money. It doesn't mean anything.

01:42:47.203 --> 01:42:50.330
You never really gave me anything
that you care about.

01:42:50.498 --> 01:42:53.041
- I want you to stop this.
- I'm not going to stop it.

01:42:53.209 --> 01:42:56.086
- Right now.
- You never gave me anything in your life.

01:42:56.254 --> 01:42:58.588
You just tried to buy me
into giving you something.

01:42:58.756 --> 01:43:00.298
Susan!

01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:07.430
- It can't be love
- It can't be love

01:43:07.598 --> 01:43:10.433
For there is no true love

01:43:19.026 --> 01:43:21.570
Whatever I do, I do because I love you.

01:43:21.737 --> 01:43:23.613
You don't love me.

01:43:23.781 --> 01:43:25.657
You want me to love you.

01:43:25.825 --> 01:43:28.660
Sure. "I'm Charles Foster Kane.

01:43:28.828 --> 01:43:31.371
Whatever you want,
just name it and it's yours.

01:43:31.539 --> 01:43:33.748
"But you gotta love me."

01:43:38.212 --> 01:43:40.964
Don't tell me you're sorry.

01:43:42.884 --> 01:43:44.634
I'm not sorry.

01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:58.064
Mr. Kane?

01:43:58.482 --> 01:44:01.234
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, sir.

01:44:04.113 --> 01:44:07.282
Marie has been packing her
since morning.

01:44:13.372 --> 01:44:17.083
Tell Arnold I'm ready, Marie.
Tell him he can get the bags.

01:44:17.627 --> 01:44:18.877
Yes, madame.

01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:23.173
Have you gone completely crazy?

01:44:23.341 --> 01:44:26.509
Don't you know that our guests,
that everyone will know about this?

01:44:26.677 --> 01:44:28.470
Packed your bag, sent for the car...

01:44:28.638 --> 01:44:31.848
And left you? Of course they'll hear.

01:44:32.850 --> 01:44:35.518
I'm not saying goodbye, except to you.

01:44:35.728 --> 01:44:38.563
But I never imagined
people wouldn't know.

01:44:41.025 --> 01:44:42.901
I won't let you go.

01:44:50.242 --> 01:44:51.868
Goodbye, Charlie.

01:44:55.456 --> 01:44:56.873
Susan.

01:45:07.051 --> 01:45:08.677
Please don't go.

01:45:14.308 --> 01:45:16.101
Please, Susan.

01:45:19.313 --> 01:45:22.732
From now on, everything will be
exactly the way you want it to be.

01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:24.985
Not the way I think you want it...

01:45:26.654 --> 01:45:28.154
...but your way.

01:45:30.408 --> 01:45:31.616
Hmm?

01:45:34.662 --> 01:45:35.996
You mustn't go.

01:45:39.250 --> 01:45:41.418
You can't do this to me.

01:45:43.087 --> 01:45:44.754
I see.

01:45:45.673 --> 01:45:48.258
It's you that this is being done to.

01:45:48.551 --> 01:45:50.343
It's not me at all.

01:45:50.594 --> 01:45:52.512
Not what it means to me.

01:45:54.682 --> 01:45:56.850
I can't do this to you?

01:45:58.310 --> 01:46:00.270
Oh, yes, I can.

01:46:19.415 --> 01:46:22.459
In case you haven't heard,
I lost all my money and it was plenty.

01:46:22.626 --> 01:46:24.878
The last 10 years
have been difficult for many.

01:46:25.046 --> 01:46:27.964
They haven't been tough on me.
I just lost all my money.

01:46:28.591 --> 01:46:31.676
- You're going down to Xanadu?
- Monday, with boys from the office.

01:46:31.844 --> 01:46:34.512
Mr. Rawlston wants
the whole place photographed.

01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:36.181
We run a picture magazine.

01:46:36.348 --> 01:46:39.976
If you're smart, you'll get in touch
with Raymond. He's the butler.

01:46:40.144 --> 01:46:42.062
You'll learn a lot from him.

01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:44.689
He knows where
all the bodies are buried.

01:46:44.857 --> 01:46:48.068
You know, all the same,
I feel kind of sorry for Mr. Kane.

01:46:50.321 --> 01:46:51.988
Don't you think I do?

01:46:56.577 --> 01:46:59.537
What do you know, it's morning already.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:06.628
Come around and tell me the story
of your life sometime.

01:47:13.636 --> 01:47:15.220
Rosebud?

01:47:17.848 --> 01:47:19.933
I'll tell you about Rosebud.

01:47:20.434 --> 01:47:22.352
How much is it worth to you?

01:47:22.937 --> 01:47:24.729
A thousand dollars?

01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:32.237
Okay.

01:47:34.031 --> 01:47:36.491
Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Thompson.

01:47:37.451 --> 01:47:40.870
- He acted funny sometimes, you know?
- No, I didn't.

01:47:41.122 --> 01:47:43.540
Yes, he did crazy things sometimes.

01:47:43.874 --> 01:47:46.209
I've been working for him 11 years now...

01:47:46.377 --> 01:47:50.213
...in charge of the whole place,
so I ought to know.

01:47:50.548 --> 01:47:51.756
- Rosebud.
- Yes.

01:47:51.924 --> 01:47:56.845
Like I tell you, the old man
acted kind of funny sometimes...

01:47:57.012 --> 01:48:00.640
...but I knew how to handle him...
Need a lot of service?

01:48:00.808 --> 01:48:03.768
Yeah. But I knew how to handle him.

01:48:03.936 --> 01:48:05.478
Like that time his wife left.

01:50:21.365 --> 01:50:22.615
Rosebud.

01:51:30.684 --> 01:51:32.226
I see.

01:51:32.895 --> 01:51:36.272
- And that's what you know about Rosebud?
- Yeah.

01:51:36.899 --> 01:51:39.275
I heard him say it that other time too.

01:51:39.943 --> 01:51:41.861
He just said:

01:51:42.237 --> 01:51:43.988
"Rosebud."

01:51:44.156 --> 01:51:47.450
Then he dropped the glass ball
and it broke on the floor.

01:51:48.118 --> 01:51:52.330
He didn't say anything after that,
and I knew he was dead.

01:51:53.082 --> 01:51:55.750
He said all kinds of things
that didn't mean anything.

01:51:55.918 --> 01:51:58.795
- Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
- Hmm...

01:51:58.962 --> 01:52:01.589
- Yes and no.
- That isn't worth $1000.

01:52:01.757 --> 01:52:04.717
You can keep on asking questions
if you want to.

01:52:04.968 --> 01:52:06.636
We're leaving tonight...

01:52:07.429 --> 01:52:09.305
...when we're through taking pictures.

01:52:09.473 --> 01:52:11.349
Allow yourself plenty of time.

01:52:11.517 --> 01:52:15.353
The train stops at the junction on signal,
but they don't like to wait.

01:52:16.397 --> 01:52:19.357
I can remember
when they'd wait all day...

01:52:19.691 --> 01:52:20.983
...if Mr. Kane said so.

01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:25.405
Better get going.

01:52:26.782 --> 01:52:28.199
Take a picture of that.

01:52:28.409 --> 01:52:32.328
- Can we come down?
- Yes, hurry up. We're leaving.

01:52:34.540 --> 01:52:38.000
How much do you think
all this is worth, Mr. Thompson?

01:52:38.210 --> 01:52:39.752
Millions.

01:52:41.213 --> 01:52:42.338
If anybody wants it.

01:52:42.506 --> 01:52:45.133
Well, at least he brought all this stuff
to America.

01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:46.968
- What's that?
- Another Venus.

01:52:47.136 --> 01:52:48.344
25,000 bucks.

01:52:48.512 --> 01:52:51.013
A lot of money to pay
for a dame without a head.

01:52:51.181 --> 01:52:54.100
- The banks are out of luck?
- Oh, I don't know.

01:52:54.852 --> 01:52:57.520
- They'll clear all right.
- He never threw anything away.

01:52:57.688 --> 01:53:02.817
"Welcome home, Mr. Kane, from 467
employees of the New York Inquirer."

01:53:02.985 --> 01:53:08.239
"One stove from the estate of Mary Kane,
$2."

01:53:08.407 --> 01:53:10.825
We're supposed to get everything,
junk as well as art.

01:53:10.993 --> 01:53:12.577
He sure liked to collect things.

01:53:12.744 --> 01:53:14.078
Anything and everything.

01:53:14.246 --> 01:53:15.872
A regular crow, eh?

01:53:16.039 --> 01:53:18.666
- Hey, look, a jigsaw puzzle.
- We got a lot of those.

01:53:18.834 --> 01:53:21.836
A Burmese temple and three
Spanish ceilings down the hall.

01:53:22.337 --> 01:53:23.713
Part of a Scotch castle...

01:53:23.881 --> 01:53:25.715
...that needs to be unwrapped.

01:53:26.049 --> 01:53:27.467
Put all this stuff together:

01:53:27.634 --> 01:53:30.678
The palaces and the paintings,
and the toys and everything.

01:53:30.846 --> 01:53:32.805
What would it spell?

01:53:34.224 --> 01:53:37.018
- Charles Foster Kane?
- Or Rosebud.

01:53:37.269 --> 01:53:40.146
- How about it, Jerry?
- What's Rosebud?

01:53:40.314 --> 01:53:42.857
That's what he said when he died.

01:53:43.525 --> 01:53:45.610
Did you ever find out what it means?

01:53:45.777 --> 01:53:47.904
- No, I didn't.
- What did you find out about him?

01:53:48.071 --> 01:53:49.572
Not much, really.

01:53:52.659 --> 01:53:54.368
We'd better get started.

01:53:56.288 --> 01:53:58.706
What have you been doing all this time?

01:53:59.750 --> 01:54:01.292
Playing with a jigsaw puzzle.

01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:05.129
If you'd discovered what Rosebud meant,
I bet it would've explained everything.

01:54:05.297 --> 01:54:06.839
No, I don't think so.

01:54:07.466 --> 01:54:08.841
No.

01:54:09.009 --> 01:54:12.553
He was a man who got
everything he wanted, and then lost it.

01:54:12.721 --> 01:54:16.307
Maybe Rosebud was something
he couldn't get or something he lost.

01:54:16.475 --> 01:54:18.768
It wouldn't have explained anything.

01:54:19.603 --> 01:54:22.730
I don't think any word
can explain a man's life.

01:54:23.690 --> 01:54:27.902
No. I guess Rosebud is just a piece
in a jigsaw puzzle.

01:54:29.071 --> 01:54:30.780
A missing piece.

01:54:34.117 --> 01:54:35.743
Well...

01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:38.788
...come on, everybody...

01:54:40.624 --> 01:54:42.875
...we'll miss the train.

01:55:47.566 --> 01:55:49.817
Throw that junk in.

01:57:22.828 --> 01:57:27.581
Maybe I was what you nowadays
call a stooge. Huh?

01:57:27.749 --> 01:57:30.042
Everything was his idea...

01:57:31.837 --> 01:57:33.671
...except my leaving him.

01:57:34.548 --> 01:57:36.841
I've got his trunk all packed.

01:57:37.843 --> 01:57:40.219
I've had it packed for a week now.

01:57:40.387 --> 01:57:44.056
Sometimes I think I'd prefer
a rival of flesh and blood.

01:57:45.976 --> 01:57:48.477
You're gonna need more than one lesson.

01:57:49.354 --> 01:57:51.897
And you'll get more than one lesson.

01:57:56.653 --> 01:57:58.863
Who's a busy man, me?

01:57:59.030 --> 01:58:02.032
I'm chairman of the board.
I got nothing but time.

01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:03.826
What do you want to know?

01:58:03.994 --> 01:58:08.831
We thought, if we could find out what he
meant by his last words as he was dying...

01:58:09.166 --> 01:58:12.001
- Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
- Hmm...

01:58:12.627 --> 01:58:13.794
Yes and no.

01:58:13.962 --> 01:58:16.881
"I think it would be fun
to run a newspaper."

01:58:17.132 --> 01:58:21.051
I think it would be fun
to run a newspaper.
