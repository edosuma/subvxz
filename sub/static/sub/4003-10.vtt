15:18.750 --> 15:20.583
- SORRY. WORKING LATE.

15:20.583 --> 15:22.750
- LIKE ALWAYS.

15:22.750 --> 15:24.542
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

15:24.542 --> 15:26.583
- HARRISON ISN'T SLEEPING,

15:26.583 --> 15:28.625
SO I'M GONNA KEEP HIM
IN OUR BED TONIGHT.

15:28.625 --> 15:31.917
- I'LL BE THERE IN A SEC.

15:31.917 --> 15:33.917
- OKAY.

15:45.750 --> 15:48.166
- ARTHUR COULD HAVE THAT BOY
ANYWHERE,

15:48.166 --> 15:50.250
AND NOW THERE'LL BE
AN ARMY OF POLICE

15:50.250 --> 15:51.792
AND VOLUNTEERS
SURROUNDING HIS PARENTS

15:51.792 --> 15:55.208
TO HELP FIND THEIR SON.

15:55.208 --> 15:58.083
I NEED TO BE ONE OF THEM.

16:01.041 --> 16:03.834
IF ARTHUR PICKED THIS
PARTICULAR BOY FOR A REASON,

16:03.834 --> 16:04.834
I NEED TO KNOW.

16:04.834 --> 16:06.083
[knock on door]

16:06.083 --> 16:07.291
COME IN.

16:07.291 --> 16:08.834
- HEY, DEX,
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

16:08.834 --> 16:10.291
- GORDY,
THANKS FOR COMING.

16:10.291 --> 16:12.333
- YEAH, SURE, NO SWEAT.
WHAT'S UP?

16:12.333 --> 16:15.458
- I DINGED A PARKED VAN
LAST NIGHT,

16:15.458 --> 16:17.959
AND I LEFT A NOTE,

16:17.959 --> 16:19.959
BUT THE DRIVER
HASN'T CALLED ME BACK.

16:19.959 --> 16:21.542
AND I'M THINKING,
AFTER I TOTALED MY CAR,

16:21.542 --> 16:22.625
I CAN'T AFFORD

16:22.625 --> 16:25.083
TO LET THE INSURANCE COMPANIES
GET INVOLVED.

16:25.083 --> 16:26.041
YOU THINK YOU CAN DO
A STAKE AND NOTIFY

16:26.041 --> 16:27.875
SO I CAN FIND THIS GUY,
PAY HIM IN CASH?

16:27.875 --> 16:30.500
- YEAH, SURE. JUST, UH,
GIVE ME THE PLATE,

16:30.500 --> 16:31.625
AND IF PATROL
SPOTS YOUR VAN,

16:31.625 --> 16:33.458
I'LL GIVE YOU A HEADS-UP
ON ITS LOCATION.

16:33.458 --> 16:35.333
- PERFECT.

16:37.792 --> 16:40.250
- HOLD ON. AS SOON AS HE'S DONE
WITH THE UNI, I'M NEXT.

16:40.250 --> 16:43.000
- NEXT FOR WHAT?
- I HAVE TO TALK TO HIM.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.417
- HE'S RIGHT IN THERE.

16:45.417 --> 16:49.166
- I'M STILL FIGURING OUT
HOW TO PHRASE IT.

16:49.166 --> 16:50.917
- HOW GAY ARE YOU?

16:50.917 --> 16:52.750
- LOOK, I--

16:52.750 --> 16:56.166
I SAW SOMETHING AT THANKSGIVING
I WISH I HADN'T.

16:56.166 --> 16:57.208
[door opens]

17:01.000 --> 17:03.667
- MORGAN.
- GORDON.

17:07.959 --> 17:10.000
JESUS,
EVER HEAR OF A COMB?

17:10.000 --> 17:11.083
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE
A CAT ON YOUR HEAD.

17:11.083 --> 17:14.333
- I'M KIND OF ON A MISSION HERE.
WHAT'S UP?

17:14.333 --> 17:17.500
- I'VE GOT THAT INTERVIEW
WITH QUINN'S SQUEEZE TODAY.

17:17.500 --> 17:18.917
- CHRISTINE?

17:18.917 --> 17:21.000
ARE YOU SURE
IT'S A GOOD IDEA

17:21.000 --> 17:24.208
TO DREDGE UP
ALL THAT LUNDY STUFF?

17:24.208 --> 17:26.458
- ACTUALLY, I'VE GOT
A FEW QUESTIONS FOR HER.

17:26.458 --> 17:28.333
I THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE
SOME IDEAS ABOUT WHO SHOT HIM.

17:28.333 --> 17:31.166
THE REAL QUESTION IS,
DO I GIVE QUINN A HEADS-UP OR--

17:31.166 --> 17:32.542
- NO, YOU DON'T.

17:32.542 --> 17:33.750
I GOTTA GO.

17:33.750 --> 17:35.000
- JUST NO?
HE'S MY PARTNER.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.208
- YEAH, HE'S ALSO
HER BOYFRIEND.

17:36.208 --> 17:38.583
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE
HIS LOYALTIES ARE.

17:38.583 --> 17:39.875
DEB, I'VE GOT FIELD WORK
I'VE GOT TO DO.

17:39.875 --> 17:41.500
- YEAH, AND I'VE GOT
A BRIEFING ON TRINITY

17:41.500 --> 17:42.542
IN, LIKE, TWO MINUTES.

17:42.542 --> 17:43.709
MY CASE.

17:43.709 --> 17:45.125
I NEED YOUR BIG BRAIN, BRO.

17:45.125 --> 17:46.500
- THERE'S NO NEW BLOOD.
THERE'S NO NEED.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.000
- NO WAY.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.041
YOU DO REALIZE I WILL STAND HERE
ALL FUCKING MORNING.

17:52.041 --> 17:53.542
IF TRINITY WORKS
IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM

17:53.542 --> 17:55.542
AND WE CAN'T GET THE OKAY
TO SWAB THESE GUYS,

17:55.542 --> 17:56.959
WE ARE BEYOND BONED.

17:56.959 --> 17:59.166
- IF HE'S EVEN IN
THE SCHOOL SYSTEM.

17:59.166 --> 18:02.041
SORRY, DEB, BUT THE SOONER
THIS IS OVER,

18:02.041 --> 18:03.875
THE SOONER I GET TO
THAT MISSING BOY'S PARENTS.

18:03.875 --> 18:06.000
- WE'VE HAD BETTER LUCK
WITH PRIVATE SCHOOLS,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.250
AND SO FAR
WE'RE LOOKING AT 240 MALES

18:08.250 --> 18:10.333
WHO FIT OUR TRINITY PROFILE.

18:10.333 --> 18:12.041
- WELL, COLLECT THEIR SAMPLES
AND GET THEM TO MASUKA.

18:12.041 --> 18:14.875
- OH, WONDERFUL.
MORE OLD MAN SPIT.

18:14.875 --> 18:16.750
- DEXTER, I NEED THE BLOOD
EVIDENCE IN THAT BAR STABBING.

18:16.750 --> 18:17.917
- PROOFING IT.

18:17.917 --> 18:20.250
- PROOF FASTER.
PRELIM'S TOMORROW.

18:20.250 --> 18:21.417
WHERE ARE WE
ON THE LUNDY SHOOTING?

18:21.417 --> 18:23.083
- I'M STILL ON
THE FOREIGN NATIONALS

18:23.083 --> 18:25.083
THAT WERE STAYING
AT THE HOTEL.

18:25.083 --> 18:28.125
SO, NO SIGNIFICANT
DEVELOPMENTS.

18:28.125 --> 18:31.792
- WHEN YOU SAY IT
LIKE THAT, NO.

18:31.792 --> 18:33.417
- OKAY.

18:34.709 --> 18:36.625
- [sighs]

18:39.166 --> 18:41.166
- HEY, UH, DEX,
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

18:41.166 --> 18:42.500
IT'S ABOUT THANKSGIVING.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.917
- LATER, VINCE.

18:44.917 --> 18:47.333
- UH...

18:47.333 --> 18:48.834
OKAY.

18:48.834 --> 18:52.458
- UH, LIEUTENANT, COULD YOU
AUTHORIZE THIS REQUISITION?

18:52.458 --> 18:54.917
COULD IT BE SO WRONG
IF YOU AND I

18:54.917 --> 18:56.792
HOPPED ON THE FIRST PLANE
TO AN ISLAND SOMEWHERE?

18:56.792 --> 18:59.625
- YES, AND THIS ISN'T
A REQUISITION.

18:59.625 --> 19:01.500
IT'S A THAI MENU.
- MM-HMM.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.250
- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT
TO MY ATTENTION, SERGEANT.

19:03.250 --> 19:05.750
- START AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES,
WORK OUR WAY UP?

19:05.750 --> 19:06.959
- DETECTIVES.

19:06.959 --> 19:08.166
- BABE?

19:08.166 --> 19:11.083
- KEEP IT IN YOUR PANTS.
SHE'S HERE TO SEE ME.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.125
- OH, YOU'RE FINALLY
DOING THE INTERVIEW?

19:12.125 --> 19:14.750
- SHE IS PERSISTENT.

19:14.750 --> 19:15.750
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

19:15.750 --> 19:17.208
- AND WHEN I'M DONE,

19:17.208 --> 19:19.458
EVERYONE IN MIAMI IS GONNA KNOW
WHAT A TRUE HERO IS.

19:19.458 --> 19:22.792
- DON'T FORGET YOUR PARTNER.
THAT'S QUINN WITH TWO Ns.

19:22.792 --> 19:24.583
- OH, SHIT, I FORGOT TO
RUN SOMETHING BY BATISTA.

19:24.583 --> 19:25.625
WILL YOU SHOW HER
TO THE BOX?

19:25.625 --> 19:26.500
AND I'LL BE THERE
IN TWO SECONDS?

19:26.500 --> 19:28.625
- YEAH.

19:32.166 --> 19:36.458
- I NEED YOU TO WATCH
CHRISTINE INTERVIEW ME.

19:36.458 --> 19:38.500
- AND I WOULD DO THAT WHY?

19:38.500 --> 19:41.333
- THIS COULD HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THE LUNDY SHOOTING.

19:41.333 --> 19:43.083
NO SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS,
REMEMBER?

19:43.083 --> 19:44.291
- OKAY.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.166
- I'M HUNGRY.

19:53.166 --> 19:56.625
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
PUT YOUR PAJAMAS ON

19:56.625 --> 19:59.208
AND WE'LL HAVE
SOMETHING TO EAT.

20:01.792 --> 20:04.166
- NO, I WON'T DO IT.

20:04.166 --> 20:06.208
I WON'T DO ANYTHING
YOU TELL ME TO.

20:18.500 --> 20:22.291
- DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

20:22.291 --> 20:26.917
FATHER DRINKS,
AND MOTHER PAYS THE PRICE.

20:29.083 --> 20:33.208
I'M JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU, ARTHUR.

20:33.208 --> 20:35.041
- MY NAME IS SCOTT!

20:38.208 --> 20:40.917
- VERY WELL.

20:54.792 --> 20:56.542
- MR. SMITH.
- YES.

20:56.542 --> 20:58.750
- I'M DEXTER MORGAN,
MIAMI METRO.

20:58.750 --> 21:01.542
I'M NOT HERE
IN ANY OFFICIAL CAPACITY.

21:01.542 --> 21:03.083
I JUST WANT TO DO
ANYTHING I CAN

21:03.083 --> 21:05.667
TO HELP FIND
YOUR MISSING SON.

21:05.667 --> 21:08.083
- WE HAVEN'T SET UP
PHONE BANKS YET,

21:08.083 --> 21:11.959
BUT, UH, WE HAVE
SOME FLYERS.

21:11.959 --> 21:14.417
- MAY I TAKE SOME WITH ME?

21:14.417 --> 21:16.375
- GREAT.

21:16.375 --> 21:18.500
[phone ringing]

21:18.500 --> 21:22.417
[overlapping chatter]

21:22.417 --> 21:24.792
- I'M THE ONLY ONE HERE
WHO KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED.

21:24.792 --> 21:29.333
I COULD POINT THE POLICE IN
ARTHUR MITCHELL'S DIRECTION.

21:29.333 --> 21:31.583
BUT THE SLIGHTEST MISSTEP
ON THEIR PART

21:31.583 --> 21:36.625
ENSURES THIS FAMILY
IS NEVER WHOLE AGAIN.

21:36.625 --> 21:38.792
[indistinct chatter]

21:38.792 --> 21:41.625
- IS THERE ANY INFORMATION
AT ALL ON YOUR SON?

21:41.625 --> 21:43.542
A TIP, A LEAD,
A PHONE CALL?

21:43.542 --> 21:45.291
ANYTHING THAT COULD POINT ME
IN A DIRECTION?

21:45.291 --> 21:46.166
- NONE.

21:46.166 --> 21:49.959
I KEEP WAITING
FOR A RANSOM NOTE.

21:49.959 --> 21:51.875
SOMETHING.

21:51.875 --> 21:54.625
- I'D BETTER GO
POST THESE.

21:54.625 --> 21:57.166
I'M GONNA DO EVERYTHING I CAN
TO HELP YOU GET YOUR SON BACK.

21:57.166 --> 21:58.166
[phone ringing]

21:58.166 --> 22:00.417
- THANK YOU.

22:03.125 --> 22:06.625
- CAN YOU IMAGINE WALKING BY
YOUR KID'S EMPTY BEDROOM,

22:06.625 --> 22:07.959
NOT KNOWING WHERE HE IS?

22:07.959 --> 22:11.750
- NO. I CAN'T.

22:13.709 --> 22:15.792
- HOW DOES A GUY LIKE THIS
MAKE A DEAD BODY

22:15.792 --> 22:17.291
JUST DISAPPEAR
INTO THIN AIR?

22:17.291 --> 22:19.792
- THE GULF STREAM
DOES THE TRICK FOR ME.

22:19.792 --> 22:21.000
- BUT THERE'S NO OCEAN
IN OMAHA,

22:21.000 --> 22:23.417
DES MOINES, ST. PAUL,
OR DENVER.

22:23.417 --> 22:26.333
- THE FOUR WALLS HOUSES.

22:26.333 --> 22:28.834
HE GOES TO EACH ONE
OF THOSE CITIES ON A BUILD

22:28.834 --> 22:30.834
AS A PRETEXT
FOR HIS KILLING CYCLE.

22:30.834 --> 22:32.250
- CONSTRUCTION SITE

22:32.250 --> 22:34.458
WOULD BE A CONVENIENT PLACE
TO BURY A BODY.

22:34.458 --> 22:37.959
- OR TO HOLD A BOY CAPTIVE.

22:40.125 --> 22:42.417
- THREE YEARS ON PATROL,

22:42.417 --> 22:45.583
TWO YEARS IN VICE.

22:45.583 --> 22:48.875
WHY HOMICIDE?

22:48.875 --> 22:50.709
- MY DAD
WAS A DETECTIVE HERE.

22:50.709 --> 22:51.917
- HMM.

22:51.917 --> 22:54.625
- BUT IT WAS COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT BEING A COP BACK THEN.

22:54.625 --> 22:58.875
- YEAH, I BET.
TALK ABOUT YOUR MAN'S WORLD.

22:58.875 --> 23:02.417
- OH, NO, NO,
IT WASN'T JUST THAT.

23:02.417 --> 23:06.208
I THINK YOU HAD TO RELY MORE
ON YOUR INSTINCTS BACK THEN.

23:06.208 --> 23:08.875
THERE WASN'T
ALL THIS FORENSICS STUFF

23:08.875 --> 23:10.792
TO LEAN ON
TO BREAK A CASE.

23:10.792 --> 23:12.917
BACK THEN, YOU HAD TO RELY
ON YOUR GUT.

23:12.917 --> 23:15.166
- AMEN TO THAT.

23:19.709 --> 23:22.041
- HAVE YOU SEEN THESE?

23:24.792 --> 23:27.583
- [exhales]

23:27.583 --> 23:31.125
- FORENSICALLY, WE'RE AT
A DEAD END WITH THE LUNDY CASE,

23:31.125 --> 23:37.000
SO I JUST STARE AT THESE,
LOOKING FOR ANSWERS.

23:43.208 --> 23:44.959
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:47.291 --> 23:50.500
I'VE GOT ENOUGH
BACKGROUND INFO.

23:50.500 --> 23:54.125
HOW ABOUT I JUST WRITE THIS UP
AND GIVE YOU A CALL

23:54.125 --> 23:58.166
IF, UH, WE DIDN'T COVER
EVERYTHING?

23:58.166 --> 24:00.208
- SURE.

24:02.125 --> 24:05.250
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

24:05.250 --> 24:06.792
YOU LIVE OVER IN THE GABLES,
RIGHT?

24:06.792 --> 24:07.917
- YEAH.

24:07.917 --> 24:10.333
- AH, THAT MUST BE
REALLY NICE,

24:10.333 --> 24:11.583
BEING AWAY FROM ALL THAT
TOURISTY STUFF.

24:11.583 --> 24:14.500
- WELL, I GOT LUCKY.
FOUND A GREAT BUILDING.

24:14.500 --> 24:16.792
- YEAH, SO THE GABLES,
THAT'S WHAT, LIKE, UH,

24:16.792 --> 24:20.417
60 MINUTES FROM THE HOTEL
WHERE FRANK WAS STAYING?

24:20.417 --> 24:22.333
- I GUESS.
- WOW.

24:22.333 --> 24:25.625
YOU SURE GOT TO
THE CRIME SCENE FAST.

24:25.625 --> 24:28.250
- [sighs]

24:28.250 --> 24:30.417
THERE'S NO TRAFFIC
AT 5:00 A.M.

24:30.417 --> 24:31.709
- OH, I KNOW THAT.

24:31.709 --> 24:35.458
BUT DISPATCH DIDN'T
PUT OUT THE CALL TILL 5:05.

24:35.458 --> 24:38.667
YOU WERE THE FIRST REPORTER
ON SCENE AT 5:20.

24:42.458 --> 24:45.667
- I LIKE TO ROLL OUT OF BED
AND HIT THE GYM EARLY.

24:45.667 --> 24:48.291
I WAS ON MY WAY THERE
WHEN I HEARD THE SCANNER.

24:48.291 --> 24:50.959
- BULLSHIT.
SHE'S LYING.

24:55.250 --> 24:57.083
- UM, HOW DO I
GET OUT OF HERE?

25:00.625 --> 25:03.417
- YOU JUST
FOLLOW THE WINDOWS

25:03.417 --> 25:05.166
TILL YOU GET
TO THE ELEVATOR.

25:20.542 --> 25:23.583
- WE'VE GOT TO TREAD
VERY, VERY LIGHTLY WITH IT.

25:23.583 --> 25:25.083
IF QUINN--
- NO SHIT.

25:25.083 --> 25:26.834
THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU
TO HELP ME SORT THROUGH THIS.

25:26.834 --> 25:29.083
TELL ME I'M NOT CRAZY.
- YOU'RE NOT CRAZY.

25:29.083 --> 25:32.166
I SPOKE TO CHRISTINE
AT YOUR CRIME SCENE.

25:32.166 --> 25:33.875
HAIR MADE, FULL MAKEUP.

25:33.875 --> 25:35.834
NO WAY SHE ROLLED OUT OF BED
AT 5:00 A.M. LOOKING LIKE THAT.

25:35.834 --> 25:38.166
- I'M TELLING YOU SHE KNOWS MORE
THAN SHE'S LETTING ON.

25:38.166 --> 25:39.959
SHE'S A HARD-BOILED
CRIME SCENE REPORTER,

25:39.959 --> 25:42.000
AND SHE COULDN'T EVEN FUCKING
LOOK AT THOSE PHOTOS OF LUNDY.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.458
- SUSPICIOUS,
BUT IT DOESN'T PROVE A THING.

25:45.458 --> 25:46.542
- WELL,
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

25:46.542 --> 25:49.875
I KNOW IT SOUNDS WEIRD,
BUT THE OTHER DAY,

25:49.875 --> 25:51.709
SHE WAS TALKING TO ME
ABOUT HOW I WAS

25:51.709 --> 25:54.875
LOOKING IN LUNDY'S EYES
WHEN HE DIED.

25:54.875 --> 25:56.917
HOW THE FUCK DOES SHE KNOW
HE DIDN'T DIE INSTANTLY?

25:56.917 --> 25:58.291
- LAGUERTA GOT BROWARD
COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT
