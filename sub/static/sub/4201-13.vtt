00:01.768 --> 00:02.770
April:  PREVIOUSLY
ON  CHASING LIFE...

00:03.003 --> 00:04.504
I DON'T WANT
TO MAKE YOU SICKER.

00:04.538 --> 00:06.407
CAN WE JUST PRETEND
THAT I'M NOT?

00:07.541 --> 00:09.176
DOMINIC STILL HAS
FEELINGS FOR ME.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.644
I WANT TO TELL HIM
TO JUST WAIT FOR ME.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.147
SO SELFISH, THOUGH.

00:13.179 --> 00:16.484
THE REASON WHY I'VE BEEN
SO SICK AND EMOTIONAL IS...

00:16.516 --> 00:19.085
-JOSH JUNIOR?
-OR GRAHAM JUNIOR.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.054
VERY FUNNY,
USING THE NAME  CHASING LIFE

00:21.088 --> 00:23.289
when you know there's
a book already being shopped
around with that title.

00:23.324 --> 00:24.725
April: DO YOU KNOW WHO'S
TRYING TO SELL THE BOOK?

00:24.759 --> 00:26.260
Calvin:

OH. SORRY,
I DIDN'T MEAN TO WAKE YOU.

01:17.076 --> 01:18.245
-(sighs)
-IT'S OKAY.

01:18.278 --> 01:20.781
I SHOULD PROBABLY GET UP.

01:20.814 --> 01:23.283
I COULDN'T SLEEP
LAST NIGHT.

01:23.317 --> 01:27.188
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT COMING
WITH ME THIS MORNING.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.289
OH, MY GOD. NO.

01:29.323 --> 01:32.626
NO, I AM ABSOLUTELY
COMING WITH YOU.

01:32.659 --> 01:34.093
GIVE ME TWO MINUTES.

01:35.195 --> 01:37.631
-WERE YOU WORKING
ON YOUR MEMOIR?
-YEAH.

01:37.664 --> 01:40.266
IT'S-- IT'S A GOOD
DISTRACTION. I JUST...

01:40.301 --> 01:43.570
I DON'T KNOW.
I THOUGHT I'D BE DONE
WITH MY OUTLINE BY NOW, BUT...

01:44.671 --> 01:47.240
YOU KNOW,
THE BIG QUESTION IS...

01:47.274 --> 01:50.411
HOW'S IT ALL GONNA END,
YOU KNOW?

01:50.444 --> 01:52.313
WHAT'S MY FINAL CHAPTER?

01:52.346 --> 01:53.847
WELL, YOU'VE GOT
A LOT ON YOUR MIND,

01:53.881 --> 01:56.450
YOU KNOW, WITH NATALIE
AND HER MOM TRYING TO
SELL YOUR DAD'S BOOK.

01:56.484 --> 01:58.752
STOP. I'M NOT THINKING
ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.888
-THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME.
-I'D RATHER IT BE ABOUT YOU.

02:02.121 --> 02:03.356
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

02:03.390 --> 02:05.825

TO TAKE BLOOD.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.525
IT'S THE 21ST CENTURY
FOR GOD'S SAKES.

02:37.557 --> 02:38.893
HOW DO YOU DO THIS
ALL THE TIME?

02:38.925 --> 02:40.426
WELL, BECAUSE YOU'RE USUALLY
WITH ME.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.228
WELL, NO OFFENSE,
BUT MAYBE IT DOESN'T WORK

02:42.263 --> 02:43.264
THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

02:43.296 --> 02:44.764
OKAY, JUST GIVE ME
A SECOND HERE.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.866
LET ME TRY SOMETHING.
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

02:46.901 --> 02:48.502
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.871
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

02:50.905 --> 02:52.872
HOLD IT.
(whispers) STICK HER.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.508
HOLD IT. HOLD IT.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.576
HOLDING IT.
NOW LET IT OUT.
LET IT OUT.

02:56.610 --> 02:57.877
BREATHE OUT SLOWLY.
BREATHE OUT.

02:57.912 --> 03:00.948
-SLOWLY LET IT OUT.
-(whimpering)

03:01.181 --> 03:02.849
GOOD GIRL. ALMOST DONE.

03:03.918 --> 03:07.187
OOH! MY PAIN THRESHOLD IS
SO LOW, APRIL.

03:07.221 --> 03:08.556
-I CAN'T HAVE A BABY.
-ALMOST DONE.

03:08.588 --> 03:09.789
YOU DID IT.
YOU'RE GOOD.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.324
-THANK YOU.
-SHE WAS SO GOOD. SHE WAS GREAT.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.793
OH GOD.

03:12.825 --> 03:15.361
-MORNING, BETH.
-HI.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.931
SO, WE SHOULD HAVE
YOUR BLOOD TEST RESULTS

03:16.963 --> 03:18.331
BACK IN A FEW DAYS,

03:18.365 --> 03:20.334
BUT BASED ON YOUR EXAM
AND LAST MENSTRUAL CYCLE,

03:20.366 --> 03:22.569
I'M GUESSING YOU'RE ABOUT
SIX WEEKS PREGNANT.

03:25.639 --> 03:28.474
SIX WEEKS. THAT MEANS IT'S JOSH.

03:28.509 --> 03:31.344
JOSH, THE PHARKAS
PHARMACEUTICAL REP

03:31.377 --> 03:32.780
IS THE FATHER OF MY BABY.

03:32.812 --> 03:34.781
AND HE IS A STAND-UP GUY.

03:34.814 --> 03:36.283
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA GET
THROUGH THIS TOGETHER.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.884
THIS IS YOUR FAULT!

03:37.918 --> 03:39.453
IF YOU HADN'T HAVE ASKED
ME TO GO OUT WITH HIM

03:39.485 --> 03:40.753
AND THEN FALL IN PRE-LOVE,

03:40.788 --> 03:42.389
-NONE OF THIS WOULD'VE HAPPENED!
-ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

03:42.423 --> 03:44.258
LET'S JUST-- LET'S CALM DOWN.
YOU'RE FEELING FOR TWO NOW.

03:44.290 --> 03:45.325
OH, MY GOD.

03:45.359 --> 03:46.826
I'M GUESSING THIS
WASN'T PLANNED?

03:46.860 --> 03:47.895
(sarcastically) OH, REALLY?

03:47.927 --> 03:49.963
WOW. CLEARLY YOU'VE
DONE THIS BEFORE.

03:51.531 --> 03:54.468
WELL, YOU HAVE TIME TO THINK
ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS.

03:55.468 --> 03:56.903
DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS?

03:56.937 --> 03:59.772
JUST ONE. WHAT DO I DO?

03:59.807 --> 04:01.942
(cellphone chimes)

04:07.948 --> 04:09.984
ONCE WE HEARD OLIVIA PUT
THE MANUSCRIPT ON THE MARKET,

04:10.016 --> 04:11.919
APRIL ASKED HER AGENT
FOR A FULL COPY.

04:11.951 --> 04:15.455
THE PARALLELS TO DAD'S LIFE ONLY
GET DEEPER IN THE SECOND HALF.

04:15.489 --> 04:18.425
TO AVOID RUSSIAN CAPTURE,
TIMOTHY ASKS HIS CONFIDANT

04:18.459 --> 04:19.860
TO HELP PLAN HIS SUICIDE

04:19.893 --> 04:21.327
TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
AN ACCIDENT.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.663
IT'S STILL JUST FICTION.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.665
WHO CARES WHAT OLIVIA
DOES WITH IT?

04:25.699 --> 04:28.901
WELL, THE FACT THAT THEY'RE
SHOPPING AROUND HIS FINAL,
UNPUBLISHED MANUSCRIPT

04:28.935 --> 04:31.904
IS SCANDALOUS ENOUGH TO DRAG
ALL OF YOU THROUGH THE MUD.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.540
IT WOULD ONLY TAKE
A ROOKIE REPORTER
A LITTLE BIT OF DIGGING

04:34.574 --> 04:36.843
TO SEE THE SIMILARITIES
TO DAD'S DEATH.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.446
AND FLORIDA'S NOT
A RIGHT-TO-DIE STATE,

04:39.480 --> 04:41.281
SO THERE COULD BE
A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.

04:41.314 --> 04:44.918
BUT THE ORTIZES
CAN'T PUBLISH THIS
WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT, RIGHT?

04:44.951 --> 04:47.954
THAT'S PROBABLY
WHY THEY WANT TO SEE ME
AND THOMAS'S ATTORNEY TOMORROW.

04:47.987 --> 04:49.656
NATALIE'S OUR SISTER.

04:49.689 --> 04:52.358
SHE WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING
TO INTENTIONALLY HURT US.

04:52.393 --> 04:57.630
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY UPSET ABOUT
DAD'S COMPLETE DISREGARD
FOR HER AND HER MOM.

04:57.665 --> 05:00.434
I'M SURE SHE'S
ALREADY TOLD OLIVIA
THE TRUTH ABOUT DAD'S DEATH.

05:00.466 --> 05:03.403
WELL, DON'T WORRY.
I'M GOING TO TAKE CARE
OF THIS MYSELF TOMORROW.

05:03.437 --> 05:04.805
NOT ALONE, YOU WON'T.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.807
TAKING CARE OF THINGS YOURSELF

05:06.839 --> 05:07.940
GOT US INTO THIS SITUATION,

05:07.975 --> 05:09.776
AND I'M NOT GONNA LET THAT
HAPPEN AGAIN.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.944
-I'M COMING WITH YOU.
-I'LL GO, TOO.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.480
TRY AND REASON WITH NATALIE.

05:13.514 --> 05:14.848
Sara: NOW THAT WE KNOW
ALL YOUR SECRETS,

05:14.882 --> 05:17.084
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER,
WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT.

05:20.954 --> 05:23.956
IT'S GOING GREAT. REALLY.
JUST MOVING RIGHT ALONG.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.959
-THAT'S GREAT.
-I KNOW. SO GREAT.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.762
WELL, I MEAN THERE'S BEEN
SOME STATIC, YOU KNOW,

05:29.797 --> 05:32.031
JUST WITH FAMILY STUFF,
BUT MY OUTLINE'S
BASICALLY FINISHED.

05:32.066 --> 05:34.000
THAT'S GOOD, BECAUSE--
I DON'T WANT TO FREAK YOU OUT,

05:34.033 --> 05:36.470
BUT THE PUBLISHER NEEDS
TO SEE SOMETHING
IN TWO WEEKS.

05:36.502 --> 05:37.971
WHY WOULD
THAT FREAK ME OUT?

05:38.004 --> 05:40.374
THEY WANT TO CAPITALIZE
ON THE PUBLICITY FROM  THE POST,

05:40.406 --> 05:42.108
SO WE HAVE TO STRIKE
WHILE THE IRON'S HOT.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.778
OKAY, THE TRUTH IS...

05:45.812 --> 05:48.415
I'M STRUGGLING, CREATIVELY.

05:48.449 --> 05:49.917
I-- I CAN HELP BRAINSTORM.

05:49.949 --> 05:51.851
WHAT DID YOUR DAD DO
IN THESE SITUATIONS?

05:52.920 --> 05:54.588
HE HAD A WRITER'S
RETREAT IN FLORIDA,

05:54.620 --> 05:57.824
WHICH HONESTLY YIELDED
A MIXED BAG OF RESULTS.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.726
BUT THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

05:59.759 --> 06:02.896
YOU SHOULD GET OUT
OF YOUR ELEMENT, AVOID STATIC,
GET INSPIRED SOMEWHERE ELSE.

06:02.930 --> 06:06.800
BECAUSE HONESTLY, THE CLOCK'S
TICKING FOR BOTH OF US.

06:10.504 --> 06:11.704
(acoustic guitar playing)

06:15.007 --> 06:15.975
-(laughs)
-YEAH!

06:16.009 --> 06:17.778
NOW GIVE ME
THAT "A" CHORD AGAIN.

06:17.810 --> 06:19.379
HERE AND HERE.

06:19.413 --> 06:21.882
(laughs)

06:21.915 --> 06:23.617
OH, NO. WHAT HAPPENED?

06:23.649 --> 06:26.386
OH, YEAH. ALL RIGHT,
YOU'RE A LITTLE OFF
ON THE FOURTH STRING HERE.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.956
TRY THIS.
ONE, TWO, THREE, AND...

06:30.557 --> 06:32.158
-UH, TRY THAT.
-OKAY.

06:32.391 --> 06:33.894
-UMM...
-YEAH.

06:35.862 --> 06:38.999
-BETTER.
-SEE? I TOLD YOU.
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.

06:39.031 --> 06:41.100
WELL, I CAN'T
DO EVERYTHING,

06:41.134 --> 06:44.538
AND RIGHT NOW,
IT FEELS LIKE I HAVE TO.

06:44.571 --> 06:47.807
YOU KNOW, BETWEEN BEING THERE
FOR MY FAMILY AND FOR BETH,

06:47.841 --> 06:50.476
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW I'M EVER
GONNA FINISH MY OUTLINE.

06:50.511 --> 06:53.413
DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP
FOR GETTING STUCK ON YOUR BOOK.

06:53.447 --> 06:55.081
WELL, HOPEFULLY I'M NOT
STUCK FOR LONG,

06:55.115 --> 06:58.552
BECAUSE I DECIDED
I'M GOING TO ITALY.

06:58.584 --> 06:59.853
-NO WAY!
-YEAH.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.822
-WOW.
-AND BETH'S COMING.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.925
I'M JUST GONNA GET AWAY
AND GET INSPIRED.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.826
YOU KNOW,
FOCUS ON MY OUTLINE

07:06.860 --> 07:09.862
AWAY FROM ALL THE OBLIGATIONS
I HAVE IN BOSTON.

07:09.896 --> 07:11.831
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO GO.
(giggles)

07:11.865 --> 07:14.701
AND I STILL HAVE THE TICKETS
FROM THE HONEYMOON

07:14.735 --> 07:16.170
I NEVER GOT
TO TAKE WITH LEO, SO...

07:18.838 --> 07:20.973
YEAH. RIGHT.

07:21.007 --> 07:24.177
WELL, WE SHOULD ALL GET
TOGETHER BEFORE YOU GO.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.947
GRILL SOME BURGERS,
GET AS MUCH AMERICAN CUISINE IN

07:26.980 --> 07:29.882
BEFORE IT'S NOTHING
BUT PASTA AND GELATO.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.218
(giggles)
I'D LOVE THAT.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.120
AND WE CAN CELEBRATE
MY BIG NEWS, TOO.

07:34.153 --> 07:36.189
LOOKS LIKE MY MOM FOUND
A BUYER FOR THE HOUSE.

07:37.191 --> 07:38.792
REALLY?

07:38.826 --> 07:41.562
OH. I WAS KINDA PULLING
FOR THAT PLACE.

07:42.562 --> 07:44.764
(chuckles) ME TOO.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.098
BUT IT'S FOR THE BEST.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.802
SO, WHERE DOES
THAT LEAVE BOSTON?

07:49.836 --> 07:51.704
MAYBE ME LEAVING IT.

07:54.141 --> 07:57.911
Laura: BY SIGNING
THIS DOCUMENT, GEORGE WILL
PROVIDE NATALIE ORTIZ,

07:57.944 --> 07:59.980
THOMAS CARVER'S
DAUGHTER AND HEIR,

08:00.012 --> 08:02.850
WITH EXCLUSIVE
PUBLISHING RIGHTS TO HIS
FINAL MANUSCRIPT

08:02.882 --> 08:05.185
AND ANY PROFITS
THAT SAID BOOK EARNS.

08:05.218 --> 08:08.154
I'M NOT SIGNING IT.
IT'S NOT WHAT THOMAS WANTED.

08:08.187 --> 08:10.723
-I'M SORRY.
-I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION

08:10.757 --> 08:12.225
THAT BOTH PARTIES HAD
AGREED TO THE TERMS

08:12.259 --> 08:13.994
AND THAT THIS WAS
MERELY A FORMALITY.

08:14.026 --> 08:16.663
PUBLICATION IS NOT
AN OPTION, OLIVIA.

08:16.697 --> 08:19.098
THOMAS PROVIDED FOR YOU
AND NATALIE IN HIS WILL.

08:19.132 --> 08:21.535
THAT WAS BEFORE
NEW INFORMATION CAME TO LIGHT.

08:21.567 --> 08:23.903
LOOK, I REPRESENT
THOMAS'S ESTATE

08:23.937 --> 08:25.906
AND THIS SOUND PERSONAL,

08:25.939 --> 08:29.242
SO I'M GOING
TO LEAVE YOU TO DISCUSS
THIS AMONGST YOURSELVES.

08:34.914 --> 08:39.253
NATALIE, I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE UPSET,

08:39.286 --> 08:40.821
BUT I WISH
YOU WOULD'VE TALKED TO US

08:40.854 --> 08:43.690
BEFORE GETTING PUBLISHERS
AND LAWYERS INVOLVED.

08:43.724 --> 08:46.659
YOU'RE LUCKY WE'RE NOT
GETTING HOMICIDE DETECTIVES
INVOLVED, TOO.

08:48.227 --> 08:51.130
DID YOU HONESTLY THINK
I WOULDN'T TELL MY OWN MOM?

08:51.163 --> 08:54.533
-THAT MY UNCLE KILLED MY DAD?
-HE DIDN'T KILL HIM.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.235
NO, HE JUST LET HIM DIE.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.304
YOU HAD NO RIGHT
TO DO THAT, GEORGE.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.173
WE SHOULD'VE KNOWN
THAT THOMAS WAS SICK.

09:00.206 --> 09:01.908
WE COULD'VE PUSHED
TO GET HIM SOME HELP.

09:01.942 --> 09:04.577
THOMAS DIDN'T TELL US
HE WAS SICK EITHER.

09:04.610 --> 09:08.181
AND THIS BOOK COMING OUT,
OLIVIA, ISN'T JUST GOING
TO HURT GEORGE OR THOMAS,

09:08.215 --> 09:11.217
-IT'S GOING TO HURT ALL OF US.
-SO WHAT?

09:11.250 --> 09:13.720
I DID WHAT MY BROTHER
WANTED ME TO DO.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.789
AND THE NIGHT HE DIED,
I DID WHAT YOU WANTED ME TO DO.

09:16.822 --> 09:17.823
REMEMBER?

09:18.825 --> 09:20.994
-GEORGE?
-AFTER THOMAS'S ACCIDENT,

09:21.028 --> 09:24.096
GEORGE TOLD ME TO TELL
THE POLICE THAT HE WAS
THE ONE DRIVING.

09:24.130 --> 09:27.033
HE SAID THOMAS WAS DRUNK,
AND THAT IF ANYONE FOUND OUT,

09:27.067 --> 09:29.036
IT WOULD TARNISH
HIS REPUTATION

09:29.068 --> 09:33.240
AND THAT NATALIE WOULD
FOREVER REMEMBER HER FATHER
AS A RECKLESS DRUNK.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.875
BUT THAT'S NOT WHY
GEORGE TOLD ME TO LIE.

09:35.908 --> 09:38.979
I LIED SO THAT
THOMAS'S REAL FAMILY

09:39.011 --> 09:40.980
WOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF.

09:41.014 --> 09:43.250
WE DESERVE TO BE
TAKEN CARE OF, TOO.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.786
EITHER GEORGE SIGNS OVER
THE RIGHTS TO NATALIE

09:45.818 --> 09:48.788
OR I'M GOING
TO GO TO THE POLICE,
AND I AM GOING TO TELL THEM

09:48.822 --> 09:50.923
THAT YOU FORCED ME TO LIE
THE NIGHT THOMAS DIED.

09:52.058 --> 09:53.626
THE CHOICE IS YOURS.

09:59.899 --> 10:01.168
(door opens)

10:11.644 --> 10:13.980
I'M GUESSING THE MEETING
WITH THE LAWYER DIDN'T GO WELL.

10:14.014 --> 10:16.783
UNLESS YOU CONSIDER BLACKMAIL
GOING WELL.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.317
IF UNCLE GEORGE DOESN'T
SIGN OVER THE MANUSCRIPT,

10:18.351 --> 10:21.288
OLIVIA'S GONNA GO
TO THE POLICE AND TELL THEM
HE HAD HER LIE

10:21.321 --> 10:22.956
-THE NIGHT DAD DIED.
-WHAT?

10:24.791 --> 10:27.995
IT WAS OVER THREE YEARS AGO,
AND I WAS JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT MY FAMILY.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.364
YOU KNOW, FOR SOMEBODY
WHO'S CONSTANTLY TRYING
TO PROTECT US,

10:30.397 --> 10:32.365
YOU GET US INTO
AN AWFUL LOT OF TROUBLE.

10:32.399 --> 10:35.201
WELL, EITHER WAY,
NATALIE WOULD NEVER
LET OLIVIA DO THAT.

10:35.235 --> 10:38.071
I KNOW THIS IS HARD FOR YOU,
BRENNA, BUT SHE WOULD.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.639
SHE IS.

10:41.008 --> 10:44.010
-I THOUGHT WE COULD TRUST HER.
-(cellphone chimes)

10:46.712 --> 10:48.081
-OH, MY GOD.
-WHAT'S WRONG?

10:49.081 --> 10:50.984
IT'S FINN.
HE'S REALLY SICK.

10:51.018 --> 10:54.354
-THEY'RE TAKING HIM
TO THE HOSPITAL.
-OH, HONEY. I'M SO SORRY.

10:54.388 --> 10:58.057
-WHAT COULD IT BE?
-PROBABLY COMPLICATIONS
FROM HIS GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.360
TELL HIS MOM
TO TAKE HIM TO MASS MEDICAL,

11:00.394 --> 11:03.929
AND ASK FOR DR. LASKY.
I'LL CALL HIM.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.698
AND IF WE LEAVE NOW,
WE CAN BE RIGHT BEHIND HIM.

11:05.731 --> 11:07.234
OKAY. THANK YOU.

11:08.235 --> 11:09.769
WE'LL TALK ABOUT
THIS LATER, ALL RIGHT?

11:17.977 --> 11:19.913
I SHOULDN'T HAVE BOOKED
THIS TRIP TO ITALY.

11:19.946 --> 11:21.313
THE TIMING COULDN'T BE WORSE.

11:21.347 --> 11:24.183
-I CAN'T LEAVE YOU GUYS NOW.
-NO, NO.

11:24.216 --> 11:26.019
GRANDMA SAID
THE SAME THING ABOUT SEDONA,

11:26.052 --> 11:29.088
AND YOU TOLD HER TO GO.
AND NOW I'M TELLING YOU
THE SAME THING.

11:29.121 --> 11:31.291
YOU'VE DEALT WITH ENOUGH
THIS YEAR AS IT IS.

11:31.323 --> 11:34.860
YOU DESERVE THIS TRIP
AND YOU'RE GONNA GET
ON THAT AIRPLANE.

11:39.432 --> 11:43.970
I REALLY TRIED TO SNEAK YOU IN
SOME PICKLE CHIPS, BUT...

11:44.004 --> 11:47.874
YOUR NURSE WAS FOR SURE,
LIKE, A POLICE DOG
IN A PAST LIFE.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.009
SHE SNIFFED THEM OUT
FROM A MILE AWAY.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.912
OH, GIVE JANETTE A BREAK.

11:51.945 --> 11:55.014
HER LAST PATIENT DIDN'T
UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT
OF A BEDPAN, SO...

11:55.048 --> 11:56.917
(coughing)

11:57.951 --> 12:00.019
SHOULD I GET SOMEONE?

12:00.052 --> 12:02.355
NO, NO. I'M FINE.

12:04.924 --> 12:07.027
SO YOU SAID
THAT YOU HAVE THE FLU?

12:08.028 --> 12:09.062
YEAH.

12:12.065 --> 12:15.034
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT WE DID?

12:15.067 --> 12:16.436
YOU KNOW...

12:17.803 --> 12:20.440
-AFTER JUNIOR BALL...
-IT'D BE A WEIRD
THING TO FORGET.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.043
(chuckles)

12:23.976 --> 12:27.379
DO YOU THINK THAT
THAT'S WHAT GOT YOU SICK?

12:27.413 --> 12:31.418
LIKE, YOU'RE LIKE THIS
BECAUSE OF ME?

12:32.985 --> 12:35.020
I DON'T KNOW.

12:35.054 --> 12:37.823
WELL, MAYBE WE JUST...

12:37.857 --> 12:41.027
GO BACK TO FULL
BELLA AND EDWARD.

12:41.061 --> 12:43.963
IT'LL BE LIKE
A LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP

12:43.996 --> 12:47.767
FOR A WHILE,
AND... IF THAT GETS HARD,

12:47.801 --> 12:50.136
SEXTING'S ALWAYS
ON THE TABLE.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.240
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S GONNA WORK.

12:53.273 --> 12:57.277
WELL, I WAS TOTALLY KIDDING
ABOUT THE SEXTING THING.

13:00.312 --> 13:03.015
BEING WITH YOU IS
ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT.

13:05.519 --> 13:07.052
AND IT CAN'T BE.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.291
I HAVE TO FOCUS
ON GETTING BETTER.

13:15.961 --> 13:16.996
OH.

13:19.032 --> 13:22.201
OF COURSE.
YOU'RE-- YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.971
I REALLY LIKE YOU, BUT...

13:27.139 --> 13:28.942
MAYBE THIS ISN'T
MEANT TO BE.

13:32.211 --> 13:34.047
(coughing)

13:42.522 --> 13:44.356
BRENNA, YOU WANNA
WAIT OUTSIDE?

13:49.828 --> 13:51.431
(coughing continues)

13:53.399 --> 13:55.268
EASY BREATHS.

13:57.102 --> 13:58.572
George:
IT'S OKAY. IT'S...

14:00.941 --> 14:03.375
HEY, JOSH.
I'M PREGNANT.

14:05.578 --> 14:08.248
WHAT DO YOU THINK, DOM?
FROM A GUY'S PERSPECTIVE.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.549
MAYBE EASE
INTO THE CONVERSATION
A LITTLE MORE?

14:11.551 --> 14:14.019
YOUR DIRECT APPROACH IS
THE WAY TO GO. TRUST ME.

14:14.053 --> 14:17.090
WE BOTH KNOW APRIL'S NEVER
BEEN GREAT AT DELIVERING
BIG NEWS, SO...

14:17.123 --> 14:19.558
OH. GLAD WE CAN JOKE
ABOUT THAT NOW.

14:19.592 --> 14:23.562
-TOOK US LONG ENOUGH, RIGHT?
-OKAY, BACK TO BETH-VILLE,
PLEASE, ALL RIGHT?

14:23.596 --> 14:27.100
I AM SO TEMPTED TO JUST,
GOD, JUST PLAY SOME ENYA

14:27.133 --> 14:29.034
AND UNWIND
WITH A BOTTLE OF SHIRAZ.

14:29.068 --> 14:31.605
-WELL, YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY AVOID ALCOHOL.
-YES, I KNOW, DOMINIC.

14:31.638 --> 14:34.607
THERE ARE PROBABLY
A LOT OF THINGS THAT I SHOULD
AVOID WHILE PREGNANT,

14:34.640 --> 14:38.544
LIKE-- OH, I DON'T KNOW--
MAYBE QUITTING MY JOB
TO BUILD MY OWN EMPIRE!

14:38.577 --> 14:41.248
-(knock on door)
-SHH!

14:42.915 --> 14:44.517
(whispers)
DO YOU THINK THAT'S HIM?

14:44.551 --> 14:47.354
-SHOULD I PRETEND I'M NOT HOME?
-YOU CAN'T AVOID HIM FOREVER.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.023
(whispers)
ALL RIGHT.

14:55.528 --> 14:59.532
-OH, MY GOD. NATALIE,
I AM SO GLAD IT'S YOU.
-(Natalie laughs)

14:59.566 --> 15:00.634
COME ON.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.903
-Beth: IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.
-Natalie: THANKS.

15:04.937 --> 15:06.639
I'M SORRY FOR JUST
BAILING LIKE THAT.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.107
OH, DON'T WORRY.
WE'RE GOOD.

15:09.275 --> 15:11.610
WHO WANTS... WATER?

15:11.644 --> 15:12.946
CAN WE TALK?

15:18.684 --> 15:21.520
LOOK, WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
A LOT TOGETHER,

15:21.553 --> 15:24.990
AND YOU KNOW
I'LL ALWAYS BE YOUR DONOR,
BUT I NEED YOU TO UNDERSTAND

15:25.024 --> 15:26.692
I HAVE TO PUBLISH
THIS MANUSCRIPT.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.528
BUT YOU'RE COMPROMISING US
AT THE SAME TIME!

15:29.562 --> 15:32.197
-I GET THAT YOU'RE UPSET,
BUT YOU CAN'T JUST...
-YOU DON'T!

15:32.231 --> 15:33.566
YOU CAN'T.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.937
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO CONSTANTLY FEEL
LIKE SOMEONE'S SECOND CHOICE.

15:45.010 --> 15:47.147
I DESERVE
THIS OPPORTUNITY, APRIL.

15:47.179 --> 15:51.384
YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH WITH THIS
AND EXPECT MY WHOLE FAMILY
JUST TO GET OVER IT.

15:53.485 --> 15:55.054
ESPECIALLY BRENNA.

15:56.088 --> 15:58.957
-IS SHE OKAY?
-SHE FEELS BETRAYED
BY HER SISTER.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.193
CAN YOU BLAME HER?

16:06.166 --> 16:10.035
♪ YOU'VE GOT A SECOND CHANCE,
YOU COULD GO HOME ♪

16:10.070 --> 16:15.408

-DAMMIT.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.037
CANCERY?

17:19.439 --> 17:22.075
OKAY, LOOK,
YOU GUYS KNOW SOMETHING.

17:22.107 --> 17:23.777
DON'T BE SHY.
WE'RE ALL GROWN-UPS HERE.

17:23.809 --> 17:26.078
YOUR COUNTS TOOK
A STEEP DIVE, APRIL.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.548
THUS THE BLEEDING.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.153
I'VE BEEN FEELING
A LITTLE OFF LATELY.
I HOPED IT WAS JUST STRESS.

17:33.185 --> 17:35.087
BECAUSE OUR TRIAL
ISN'T WORKING,

17:35.121 --> 17:38.490
IT'S UNLIKELY THAT
STAYING ON IT WILL YIELD
ANY REAL RESULTS.

17:40.192 --> 17:41.528
I'M SO SORRY.

17:42.528 --> 17:44.830
0 FOR 2, BUT THIRD TIME'S
A CHARM, RIGHT?

17:46.132 --> 17:50.804
-WHAT'S NEXT?
-SINCE CHEMO AND THE OTHER
TRIALS HAVEN'T BEEN EFFECTIVE,

17:50.836 --> 17:53.405
YOU COULD LOOK INTO OPTIONS
OTHER THAN TREATMENT

17:53.440 --> 17:56.809
AS A WAY
TO HELP YOU ENJOY THE REST
OF YOUR DAYS COMFORTABLY.

17:58.144 --> 18:00.113
THE REST OF MY DAYS?

18:00.145 --> 18:02.248
THE REST OF MY DAYS?
IS THIS IT?

18:02.281 --> 18:05.084
A QUALITY-VERSUS-
QUANTITY CONVERSATION?

18:05.117 --> 18:07.287
-ARE WE THERE ALREADY?
-NO, WE ARE NOT. NO.

18:07.319 --> 18:09.288
APRIL IS NOT GIVING UP.
SHE'S NOT A QUITTER.

18:09.321 --> 18:12.858
WELL, NEITHER ARE ALL
THE OTHER PATIENTS WHO FEEL
THAT AGGRESSIVE TREATMENTS

18:13.092 --> 18:15.394
ARE NO LONGER WORTH
THE PAIN AND EFFORT
IT CAN COST THEM.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.596
OUR TRIAL IS ONE
OF THE MORE INVASIVE ONES,

18:17.630 --> 18:20.200
AND I PERSONALLY MAKE IT
A POINT TO GIVE MY PATIENTS

18:20.232 --> 18:22.634
-ALL THEIR OPTIONS.
-WELL, SHE'S NOT YOUR PATIENT,

18:22.669 --> 18:24.170
SO THANK YOU.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.273
-APRIL.
-MMM?

18:28.307 --> 18:30.210
THERE ARE OTHER TRIALS,
AND IF NEED BE,

18:30.242 --> 18:32.278
WE CAN STILL DO
THE TRANSPLANT.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.280
WITH ACTIVE CANCER?

18:35.315 --> 18:36.816
GETTING RID OF IT
WOULD'VE BEEN IDEAL,

18:36.849 --> 18:38.817
BUT IT'S STILL
A VERY REAL OPTION.

18:43.522 --> 18:45.825
-(school bell rings)
-(rock music playing)

18:47.259 --> 18:49.229
(kids chattering)

18:57.269 --> 19:00.839
-WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
-YOU HAVEN'T RESPONDED
TO ANY OF MY TEXTS.

19:00.874 --> 19:03.142
-AND?
-LOOK, I DON'T WANT
WHAT'S GOING ON

19:03.175 --> 19:04.911
BETWEEN OUR FAMILIES
TO MESS UP THINGS WITH US.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.813
I'M STILL YOUR BIG SISTER.

19:06.846 --> 19:10.316
OKAY, IF YOU THINK THAT
YOU'RE BEING A BIG SISTER
RIGHT NOW,

19:10.349 --> 19:12.885
YOU HAVE THE CONCEPT
TOTALLY TWISTED.

19:12.919 --> 19:15.788
MY BIG SISTER
IS SOMEONE WHO

19:15.821 --> 19:17.856
LOOKS OUT FOR ME,

19:17.891 --> 19:20.460
AND SOMEONE THAT
I CAN LOOK UP TO,

19:20.492 --> 19:23.496
SOMEONE WHO I CAN TALK TO
AFTER GETTING DUMPED.

19:23.529 --> 19:27.366
-WAIT, WHO DUMPED YOU?
-NO. YOU DON'T GET TO KNOW
ABOUT MY LIFE ANYMORE.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.868
I'M SORRY, BRENNA,
BUT I'M SICK OF BEING
THE INVISIBLE ONE.

19:29.903 --> 19:32.739
HEY, YOU WERE
THE ONE WHO TAUGHT ME

19:32.771 --> 19:35.541
THAT I WAS MORE
THAN EVERYONE ELSE'S
OPINION OF ME.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.876
WHY CAN'T YOU SEE
THAT YOU ARE TOO?

19:39.278 --> 19:41.647
-IT'S NOT THAT EASY.
-OF COURSE NOT!

19:41.681 --> 19:43.849
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE SISTERS
TO FALL BACK ON

19:43.883 --> 19:45.751
WHEN THINGS GET HARD.

19:45.785 --> 19:49.822
SISTERS WHO ALWAYS BELIEVED
THAT YOU WERE GOOD ENOUGH.

19:56.962 --> 20:00.299
-(sighs)
-Sara: I'VE BEEN THINKING.

20:00.333 --> 20:01.867
MAYBE WE SHOULD
GET A LAWYER,

20:01.901 --> 20:04.202
SEE WHAT THEY WOULD
SUGGEST WE DO.

20:04.237 --> 20:05.704
I'VE BEEN...

20:05.738 --> 20:08.273
DOING SOME
THINKING, TOO, AND...

20:09.608 --> 20:12.979
IT JUST MIGHT BE BEST
IF I GO TO THE POLICE
AND COME CLEAN...

20:13.813 --> 20:16.348
-ABOUT EVERYTHING.
-YOU COULD LOSE YOUR LICENSE.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.651
-YOU COULD GO TO PRISON.
-I JUST CAN'T STOMACH THE IDEA

20:18.684 --> 20:20.920
OF PUTTING YOU AND THE GIRLS
THROUGH ANY MORE PAIN.

20:20.953 --> 20:23.522
CLEANING UP
THIS MESS ALONE IS...

20:23.556 --> 20:25.892
IS ALL I KNOW.
EVEN WHEN I WAS WITH MAE

20:25.924 --> 20:27.894
AND EVEN WHEN
I WAS WITH YOU...

20:28.928 --> 20:32.798
THERE WAS A STILL
A PART OF ME THAT WAS ALWAYS
ALONE WITH THESE SECRETS.

20:32.832 --> 20:33.833
WELL...

20:34.834 --> 20:36.736
YOU'RE NOT ALONE ANYMORE.

20:39.771 --> 20:41.874
-WE'RE HERE, GEORGE.
-(door opens)

20:41.907 --> 20:44.943
AND WE'RE GONNA
GET THROUGH THIS
TOGETHER AS A FAMILY.

20:44.978 --> 20:45.845
(door closes)

20:46.846 --> 20:48.280
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

20:49.749 --> 20:53.019
WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION
ABOUT DAD'S MANUSCRIPT TOGETHER.

20:53.251 --> 20:55.520
Brenna:
NATALIE CAME
BY MY SCHOOL TODAY.

20:55.555 --> 20:57.789
SHE SEEMED
PRETTY DETERMINED.

20:57.824 --> 21:00.526
WELL, OLIVIA HAS POWER
OVER ALL OF US,

21:00.559 --> 21:02.561
BECAUSE SHE'S HOLDING
THE POLICE OVER MY HEAD.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.698
THE ONLY WAY TO CHANGE THAT
IS IF I GO TO THE AUTHORITIES
AND TELL THE TRUTH.

21:05.731 --> 21:08.367
MAYBE YOU JUST SIGN
THE DOCUMENTS.

21:08.401 --> 21:11.837
I MEAN,
WE GIVE 'EM WHAT THEY WANT
AND HOPE FOR THE BEST.

21:11.871 --> 21:14.374
NO, WE'RE FINDING
ANOTHER WAY.

21:14.406 --> 21:15.875
I DON'T KNOW THAT
THERE IS ANOTHER WAY.

21:15.907 --> 21:17.777
I'M NOT SURE THAT
THIS IS A FIGHT WE CAN WIN.

21:17.809 --> 21:19.612
WELL, WE HAVE TO TRY.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.315
(sighs)

21:24.951 --> 21:27.787
LAST NIGHT I GOT
A PAPER CUT THAT
WOULDN'T STOP BLEEDING,

21:27.819 --> 21:30.923
AND THIS MORNING I FOUND OUT
THAT MY CLINICAL TRIAL
ISN'T WORKING.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.326
-OH, APRIL.
-IT'S OKAY.

21:34.359 --> 21:36.729
I'M GONNA GET
THROUGH THIS.

21:36.762 --> 21:38.798
AS SOON
AS I'M BACK FROM ITALY,
ONCE I'VE CLEANSED MY SYSTEM,

21:38.830 --> 21:40.732
FROM THIS LAST TRIAL...

21:41.733 --> 21:43.336
I'M GONNA FIGHT FOR MY LIFE,

21:43.368 --> 21:45.971
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I DO.

21:46.939 --> 21:50.410
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO.
WE FIGHT.

21:50.442 --> 21:53.078
WE'RE NOT GONNA
LET OLIVIA AND NATALIE
PUBLISH THIS BOOK,

21:53.311 --> 21:56.048
WE'RE NOT GONNA LET
UNCLE GEORGE GO TO JAIL,

21:56.082 --> 21:59.618
WE'RE NOT GONNA LET
DAD'S SECRETS TAKE US DOWN.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.854
WE'RE GONNA FIGHT THIS.

22:01.887 --> 22:03.789
AND WE'RE GONNA WIN.

22:14.032 --> 22:16.868
(rock music playing)

22:16.903 --> 22:18.971
(chattering)

22:19.005 --> 22:21.039
TWO GIRLS HEADING OFF
TO ITALY ALONE.

22:21.074 --> 22:23.875
-SOUNDS LIKE A MOVIE.
-WHERE THEY DISCOVER LOVE?

22:23.910 --> 22:25.978
-OH. AND THEMSELVES?
-MMM.

22:26.011 --> 22:29.449
MAYBE A GERMAN SCIENTIST
WHO WANTS TO TURN THEM
INTO A HUMAN CENTIPEDE.

22:29.481 --> 22:31.616
-WATCH YOUR BACKS.
-DON'T EVEN JOKE.

22:32.617 --> 22:33.952
SAFE TRAVELS.

22:33.986 --> 22:35.855
OH. BABE, YOU'RE EMPTY.

22:35.887 --> 22:38.023
-HERE, TAKE MINE.
I'LL GRAB ANOTHER.
-THANKS.

22:40.992 --> 22:43.462
LAST CHANCE
FOR ALL-AMERICAN BURGERS
FOR A WHILE.

22:43.496 --> 22:44.997
YES, PLEASE.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.936
I GIVE THIS PLANT ANY MORE BEER,
IT'S GONNA START SWEARING.

22:50.970 --> 22:53.772
-OH, MY GOSH, JUST TELL HIM.
-TELL WHO WHAT?

22:54.941 --> 22:58.944
TELL YOU THAT...
MY EX-BOYFRIEND
LIVES HERE TOO.

22:58.978 --> 23:01.713
OH. IT'S A GOOD THING
HE'S NOT HERE TONIGHT.

23:01.748 --> 23:04.116
-MIGHT GET TERRITORIAL.
-GREAT.

23:04.150 --> 23:05.917
WHO'S HUNGRY?

23:09.122 --> 23:11.423
OH. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

23:30.476 --> 23:32.577
(doorbell rings)

23:32.612 --> 23:34.012
I GOT IT!

23:39.484 --> 23:40.920
HEY, BREN.

23:43.722 --> 23:46.925
UH... ARE YOU GONNA
INVITE ME IN?

23:48.528 --> 23:50.997
-YEAH!
-(both laugh)

23:51.029 --> 23:52.565
OH, MY GOD.

23:54.066 --> 23:57.135
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE HERE.
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU WERE IN TOWN.

23:57.170 --> 23:59.204
WELL, MY DAD HAD
SOME BUSINESS IN THE CITY,

23:59.438 --> 24:01.907
AND YOU HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE RADIO SILENT,

24:01.941 --> 24:04.743
SO I THOUGHT I'D SURPRISE YOU,
SEE HOW YOU'VE BEEN.

24:05.744 --> 24:09.147
-HONESTLY, I'VE BEEN BETTER.
-I THOUGHT SO.

24:09.182 --> 24:11.983
LAST TEXT I GOT FROM YOU,
THERE WAS SOME FAMILY
STUFF GOING ON?

24:13.451 --> 24:14.886
YEAH. (chuckles)

24:17.890 --> 24:19.991
I SAW YOUR
JUNIOR BALL PHOTOS.

24:20.026 --> 24:22.595
-YOU LOOKED GORGEOUS.
-THANKS.

24:22.627 --> 24:24.696
BETH DESIGNED MY DRESS.

24:24.730 --> 24:28.467
A WAY BETTER EXPERIENCE
THAN LAST YEAR'S FASHION
SHOW FROM HELL.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.836
OH, GOD, I STILL
GET P.T.S.D. FLASHBACKS

24:30.869 --> 24:32.872
ANY TIME I SEE FLORAL PRINT.

24:32.904 --> 24:35.040
-MM-HMM.
-(both laugh)

24:35.875 --> 24:37.576
SO WHO IS THAT GUY
YOU WENT WITH?

24:37.609 --> 24:40.579
-THE ONE IN THE SARS MASK.
-OH, FINN?

24:40.613 --> 24:42.748
HE'S JUST A FRIEND.

24:43.849 --> 24:46.251
SO, WHAT'S NEW WITH YOU?
HOW LONG ARE YOU HERE?

24:46.484 --> 24:49.855
WELL, WE'RE HERE
A COUPLE OF DAYS... FOR NOW.

24:50.856 --> 24:54.794
-FOR NOW?
-MY DAD MISSED THE CITY,
SO WE'RE ACTUALLY MOVING BACK

24:54.826 --> 24:55.994
TO BEACON HILL.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.931
-HEY, NEIGHBOR.
-(laughs)

25:01.767 --> 25:04.569
-(knock on door)
-SOMEONE'S IN HERE.

25:07.506 --> 25:10.076
WOW.
I LIKE DRUNK BETH.

25:10.108 --> 25:12.678
IT'S A SMALL SPACE,
BUT WE'RE A CREATIVE COUPLE.

25:12.711 --> 25:14.779
I'M DEFINITELY
NOT HERE FOR SEX,

25:14.814 --> 25:17.516
-AND I'M NOT DRUNK.
-AFTER FIVE BEERS?

25:17.549 --> 25:19.951
-JOSH...
-(knock on door)

25:19.986 --> 25:22.855
I... DO YOU REMEMBER
THAT EPISODE OF  FRIENDS?

25:22.888 --> 25:25.090
-THE ONE WITH THE EMBRYOS?
-NO.

25:25.124 --> 25:27.192
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT
THE EPISODE OF  WILL & GRACE,

25:27.226 --> 25:30.528
YOU KNOW, WHERE GRACE RACES
ACROSS CENTRAL PARK
WITH WILL'S SPERM?

25:30.563 --> 25:33.132
-UH...
-NO. WHAT ABOUT
THE  SAVED BY THE BELL,

25:33.164 --> 25:36.234
YOU KNOW, WHERE ZACK GETS
TRAPPED IN THE ELEVATOR
WITH MR. BELDING'S WIFE?

25:36.269 --> 25:38.604
YES, THAT WAS
THE EARTHQUAKE EPISODE, RIGHT?

25:38.637 --> 25:41.307
THAT WAS SO CHEESY.
ALL THEY DID WAS SHAKE
THE CAMERA, REMEMBER?

25:41.539 --> 25:43.709
(Danny knocks)
SOMEONE'S WAITING OUT HERE!

25:43.742 --> 25:45.978
GONNA HAVE
TO HOLD IT, GUPTA!

25:47.113 --> 25:48.280
I'M PREGNANT.

25:48.314 --> 25:50.148
Danny:
GOTTA GO, GOTTA GO!

25:50.182 --> 25:51.884
ARE YOU SURE?

25:53.752 --> 25:55.086
BUT YOU JUST DRANK
LIKE FIVE BEERS.

25:55.121 --> 25:58.924
I DIDN'T DRINK THEM.
I USED THEM TO WATER
THE FICUS, TO...

25:58.958 --> 26:00.558
TO BUY MYSELF TIME
TO TELL YOU.

26:07.967 --> 26:09.035
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

26:10.102 --> 26:11.836
STILL PROCESSING.

26:13.739 --> 26:16.741
COULD YOU PROCESS FASTER PLEASE,
BECAUSE I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

26:16.776 --> 26:20.211
-I MEAN, IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE BOTHERED, I--
-NO. GOD, IT'S...

26:20.246 --> 26:22.013
IT'S NOT THAT AT ALL,
AND I'M SORRY.

26:25.017 --> 26:26.719
WHATEVER YOU WANNA DO...

26:27.720 --> 26:30.056
I'LL BE WITH YOU
EVERY SINGLE STEP OF THE WAY.

26:36.194 --> 26:37.663
THANK YOU.

26:39.832 --> 26:43.269
YOU KNOW, I STILL
WANNA GO TO ITALY,
YOU KNOW, WEIGH MY OPTIONS,

26:43.301 --> 26:45.770
AND WE CAN JUST DECIDE
WHEN I GET BACK.

26:46.838 --> 26:48.740
I'LL BE WAITING HERE
WHEN YOU DO.

26:55.013 --> 26:56.715
LEAVE IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO SEE ME PEE.

27:01.753 --> 27:04.022
YOU'RE LEAVING TOMORROW
AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE
YOUR PASSPORT IS?

27:04.056 --> 27:05.891
I'M PRETTY SURE
IT'S AT MY MOM'S HOUSE.

27:05.924 --> 27:07.058
I'LL FIND IT.

27:07.093 --> 27:08.227
-WOW.
-(laughs)

27:08.259 --> 27:10.028
EVERY DAY REALLY IS
AN ADVENTURE FOR YOU.

27:10.061 --> 27:11.830
CAN'T KNOCK ADVENTURE.

27:11.864 --> 27:13.732
DIDN'T YOU LOVE
PERFORMING FOR THE KIDS?

27:13.766 --> 27:16.067
YOU'VE SHOWN ME HOW GREAT
IT IS TO TAKE BIG RISKS.

27:17.068 --> 27:18.903
GUESS THAT'S WHY
I'M THINKING OF MOVING.

27:18.938 --> 27:20.806
TRY SOMETHING CRAZY.

27:22.008 --> 27:24.076
IT'S KIND OF SAD TO THINK
ABOUT YOU NOT LIVING HERE.

27:25.111 --> 27:27.380
YOU'VE HAD SOME BIG MEMORIES
IN THIS APARTMENT.

27:27.413 --> 27:29.949
-EATING A POT COOKIE,
COMING HERE.
-MM-HMM.

27:29.981 --> 27:31.951
TAKING E,
COMING HERE.

27:32.984 --> 27:34.119
YEAH.

27:34.153 --> 27:37.390
WELL, IT WASN'T THE APARTMENT
I WAS COMING TO.

27:41.394 --> 27:44.829
WOW. WHAT HAPPENED
TO THIS PARTY, HUH?

27:44.864 --> 27:46.365
(scoffs)
IT'S AFTER 2:00.

27:47.365 --> 27:50.802
DOM, DANNY TOLD ME THAT...

27:51.971 --> 27:53.905
YOU MIGHT STILL
HAVE FEELINGS FOR ME.

27:57.442 --> 27:59.077
WHY ARE YOU
BRINGING THIS UP?

28:00.779 --> 28:03.015
IF I DIE TOMORROW, I...

28:03.048 --> 28:05.384
I DON'T WANNA REGRET
NOT TALKING TO YOU ABOUT THIS.

28:05.417 --> 28:08.153
STOP. I DON'T WANNA BE
YOUR ADVENTURE RIGHT NOW.

28:08.186 --> 28:10.890
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I STILL HAVE FEELINGS
FOR YOU, TOO.

28:26.905 --> 28:28.039
SORRY.

28:31.309 --> 28:33.945
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT OVER LEO...

28:34.980 --> 28:36.347
AND I ACCEPT THAT.

28:38.451 --> 28:40.019
I'M TRYING TO MOVE ON.

28:42.153 --> 28:43.923
MAYBE JUST BECAUSE TWO PEOPLE
WANT THE SAME THING,

28:43.955 --> 28:46.325
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
THEY LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

28:47.926 --> 28:49.929
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE.

28:49.961 --> 28:54.066
YOU'RE GONNA GO TO ITALY
AND YOU'RE GONNA COME BACK HERE
AND GET WELL.

28:57.368 --> 28:59.771
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN HARD, DOM.

29:01.173 --> 29:04.977
THIS TIME,
THIS NEXT BATTLE,

29:05.009 --> 29:06.479
IT'S GONNA BE HARDER.

29:07.512 --> 29:08.980
I CAN FEEL IT.

29:10.915 --> 29:13.986
I JUST-- I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE
AND NOT TELL YOU HOW I FELT.

29:14.019 --> 29:15.988
-AP--
-NO, I'M SORRY.

29:16.020 --> 29:18.790
I GOTTA GO, BUT THANK YOU
FOR AN AMAZING NIGHT

29:18.824 --> 29:20.893
AND FOR EVERYTHING.

29:23.996 --> 29:25.498
(door opens)

29:27.165 --> 29:28.299
(door closes)

29:37.175 --> 29:40.412
-THIS ISN'T
THE DOCUMENT WE GAVE YOU.
-IT'S A CEASE AND DESIST LETTER.

29:40.445 --> 29:43.315
YOU AND NATALIE ARE BARRED
FROM PUBLISHING THOMAS'S BOOK

29:43.348 --> 29:45.351
OR SENDING IT
TO ANYONE AT ALL.

29:45.384 --> 29:47.252
LEGAL ACTION
WILL BE TAKEN IF YOU DO.

29:47.286 --> 29:50.955
-I'LL GO TO THE POLICE, GEORGE.
-YOU GO AHEAD AND YOU
TELL THEM YOUR STORY,

29:50.990 --> 29:53.025
'CAUSE THAT'S ALL
IT WILL BE TO THEM, A STORY,

29:53.057 --> 29:55.560
AND I WILL DENY
EVERYTHING YOU SAY.

29:55.794 --> 29:59.198
IT'S TIME TO DROP
THIS CRAZINESS BEFORE
ANY REAL DAMAGE GETS DONE.

29:59.230 --> 30:01.799
AND YOU DON'T THINK NATALIE'S
BEEN DAMAGED BY ALL THIS?

30:01.834 --> 30:04.903
-YOU ARE DOING MORE HARM
BY ENCOURAGING THIS REVENGE...
-(door opens)

30:04.936 --> 30:08.140
...OVER SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENED SO LONG AGO.

30:08.173 --> 30:10.442
-WHAT'S GOING ON?
-THEY'RE TRYING TO STOP US

30:10.476 --> 30:13.011
FROM GOING TO THE POLICE,
BUT WE'RE NOT BACKING DOWN.

30:13.045 --> 30:17.182
-I'VE BEEN
TOO NICE FOR TOO LONG.
-WHEN WERE YOU NICE, OLIVIA?

30:17.215 --> 30:19.117
WHEN YOU BLACKMAILED
MY FAMILY

30:19.151 --> 30:21.921
-OR WHEN YOU SLEPT
WITH MY HUSBAND?
-STOP!

30:22.954 --> 30:24.022
PLEASE.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.259
I'M DONE, MOM.

30:28.294 --> 30:30.528
-WE NEED TO LET THIS GO.
-WE CAN WIN THIS.

30:30.563 --> 30:32.597
IT'S NOT ABOUT
WINNING ANYMORE.

30:32.830 --> 30:36.367
GOING FURTHER
WILL ONLY KEEP THIS
AWFUL FEUD ALIVE.

30:36.402 --> 30:38.069
I CAN'T DO IT.

30:38.103 --> 30:40.905
I'M MORE THAN A SIDE CHARACTER
IN THE THOMAS CARVER STORY.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.307
WE BOTH ARE.

30:42.340 --> 30:44.843
AND THE ONLY WAY
WE CAN PROVE THAT
TO OURSELVES AND TO THEM

30:44.876 --> 30:46.278
IS BY BREAKING THE CYCLE.

30:49.914 --> 30:51.217
I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY.

30:53.051 --> 30:54.920
THEN PLEASE DO THIS FOR ME.

31:07.932 --> 31:11.369
-ANY LUCK?
-NOTHING YET.

31:11.403 --> 31:14.606
YOU ARE JUST GONNA HAVE
SUCH A GOOD TIME.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.942
IT'S A LOT EASIER LEAVING
KNOWING THAT THINGS

31:16.976 --> 31:18.544
WITH NATALIE AND OLIVIA
ARE RESOLVED.

31:18.576 --> 31:20.412
YEAH, NATALIE REALLY
STEPPED UP,

31:20.445 --> 31:23.082
REALIZING THAT
ALL THIS FIGHTING IS

31:23.115 --> 31:25.150
NOT WORTH THE PAIN
IT'S CAUSING.

31:25.183 --> 31:26.919
I WAS REALLY PROUD
OF HER. (gasps)

31:26.951 --> 31:29.020
I FOUND IT!

31:29.054 --> 31:30.221
LOOK OUT, ITALY.

31:30.256 --> 31:32.023
(laughs)
AND DON'T FORGET...

31:32.057 --> 31:35.027
(hesitantly)
THE TERRACE
OF CAMPIDOGLIO...

31:35.059 --> 31:36.461
AT SUNSET.

31:37.997 --> 31:40.266
IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE.

31:40.298 --> 31:41.500
(chuckles)

31:43.001 --> 31:46.105
SO, DID YOU SAY GOODBYE
TO DOMINIC LAST NIGHT?

31:47.105 --> 31:48.106
YEAH.

31:49.107 --> 31:51.009
MAYBE FOR GOOD.

31:52.111 --> 31:55.146
TRUTHFULLY, I DON'T KNOW
IF I'LL EVER GET OVER LEO, MOM.

31:56.582 --> 32:00.219
YOU KNOW, HONEY,
I LOVED LEO.

32:00.251 --> 32:04.088
HE WAS SO CHARMING
AND GRAND.

32:05.089 --> 32:07.526
AND YOUR RELATIONSHIP WAS EPIC.

32:09.428 --> 32:13.031
BUT TAKE IT FROM SOMEONE
WHO MARRIED CHARMING AND GRAND

32:13.065 --> 32:15.067
AND TRIED TO LIVE
AN EPIC LIFE--

32:15.099 --> 32:17.001
SOMETIMES THE GUY
WHO STICKS BY YOU,

32:17.036 --> 32:19.104
THE GUY WHO NEVER GIVES UP,

32:19.137 --> 32:21.640
IS THE GUY YOU SHOULD
BUILD A LIFE WITH.

32:21.673 --> 32:22.974
(knock on door)

32:23.008 --> 32:25.044
HEY, I CALLED YOUR CAB.

32:27.011 --> 32:29.948
-(sighs)
-(rock music playing)

32:33.519 --> 32:39.357
♪ IT'S THAT STORM
BEHIND YOUR EYES ♪

32:39.391 --> 32:45.064
♪ IT'S WHERE I STAND ♪

32:46.664 --> 32:52.637
♪ TOUCHING,
GUARDED BY THE NIGHT ♪

32:52.671 --> 32:57.576
♪ YOU SECURE ME ♪

32:57.608 --> 32:59.010
DID YOU FORGET SOMETHING?

33:02.247 --> 33:06.352
APRIL, WE ARE ABOUT TO TAKE
AN INCREDIBLE VACATION,

33:06.384 --> 33:08.119
SO VACATE.

33:10.422 --> 33:13.392
WE'RE GONNA
BE BACK SOON, ALL RIGHT?

33:13.424 --> 33:16.295
TO THE AIRPORT,
AND STEP ON IT!

33:16.327 --> 33:17.563
WAIT!

33:17.596 --> 33:20.632
Beth: HEY, DOM.
PLEASE DON'T MAKE US LATE.

33:20.665 --> 33:23.102
WE'LL BE QUICK.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

33:23.134 --> 33:26.404
WHEN ONE OF US
LEAVES THE COUNTRY,
THINGS TEND TO GO BADLY,

33:26.438 --> 33:28.574
SO I NEED TO ASK THIS
BEFORE YOU GO.

33:30.075 --> 33:31.076
ASK WHAT?

33:32.344 --> 33:34.313
WE'RE NOT DONE, ARE WE?

33:35.314 --> 33:37.682
I MEAN, I KEEP THINKING
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID LAST NIGHT.

33:38.683 --> 33:41.787
AND I JUST WANNA KNOW...
THERE'S STILL HOPE, RIGHT?

33:42.755 --> 33:44.655
OUR STORY ISN'T OVER, IS IT?

33:48.594 --> 33:51.730
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT HOPE OR THE FUTURE.

33:51.763 --> 33:54.599
-ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT
IS RIGHT NOW.
-(sighs)

33:54.633 --> 33:56.134
AND RIGHT NOW...

34:03.174 --> 34:04.542
COME WITH US.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.346
-TO ITALY?
-YEAH!

34:07.378 --> 34:09.481
WE CAN SWING BY YOUR PLACE
ON THE WAY TO THE AIRPORT,

34:09.514 --> 34:12.284
YOU CAN GRAB
YOUR PASSPORT,
AND PACK A BAG,

34:12.317 --> 34:13.684
AND JUST GO.

34:21.126 --> 34:23.829
(Italian rock music playing)

34:37.275 --> 34:39.210
(no discernible dialog)

35:10.442 --> 35:12.376
Beth:
APRILE CARVIERI!

35:12.411 --> 35:15.112
I REFUSE TO BE
IN ONE MORE SELFIE
UNLESS YOU TAKE IT.

35:15.146 --> 35:16.748
DOM DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
MY ANGLES LIKE YOU DO.

35:16.782 --> 35:18.516
SAY NO MORE.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.222
HELP. (laughs)

35:25.224 --> 35:27.559
-Dominic: COME ON.
-OKAY.

35:27.592 --> 35:29.862
-ALL RIGHT.
-(phone camera clicks)

35:29.894 --> 35:30.896
SEE? GOOD ANGLES.

35:31.128 --> 35:32.463
-OH, CUTE.
-THAT'S GREAT.

35:32.498 --> 35:34.233
WE SHOULD GRAB FOOD
BEFORE THE  RIPOSO,

35:34.266 --> 35:36.268
WHEN EVERYTHING
CLOSES DOWN FOR A FEW HOURS
IN THE AFTERNOON--

35:36.300 --> 35:40.873
-CAFES,  GELATERIAS --
-WAIT, THEY CLOSE
THE  GELATERIAS?

35:40.905 --> 35:42.773
OKAY, I GOTTA GO.
EXCUSE ME.

35:42.807 --> 35:44.876
(laughs)

35:45.844 --> 35:47.478
(sighs)

35:47.512 --> 35:51.650
SO, IS ROME AS INSPIRING
AS YOU HOPED IT WOULD BE?

35:52.650 --> 35:53.918
IT'S BETTER.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.389
YOU KNOW,
JUST BEING AWAY FROM BOSTON,

35:57.422 --> 36:00.759
THE SYRINGES,
AND THE IVS THAT COME
ALONG WITH IT,

36:00.791 --> 36:03.762
HAS BEEN... LIFE-CHANGING.

36:04.762 --> 36:06.532
ENDLESS WINE AND PASTA
WILL DO THAT.

36:06.565 --> 36:08.199
(laughs)
THAT TOO.

36:08.233 --> 36:11.903
IT'S JUST THIS CITY,
BEING HERE WITH BETH AND...

36:11.936 --> 36:13.871
BEING HERE WITH YOU.

36:16.507 --> 36:18.242
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M HERE.

36:19.311 --> 36:23.181
HEY, YOU REMEMBER
THAT 37 REGRETS LIST?

36:24.181 --> 36:28.653
I WAS LOOKING AT IT,
JUST GOING OVER ALL THE THINGS
I'D REGRET NOT DOING.

36:28.686 --> 36:31.422
I WAS SO SCARED THAT CANCER
WOULD PREVENT ME

36:31.456 --> 36:34.192
FROM CHECKING OFF
THAT LAST REGRET.

36:35.661 --> 36:37.496
LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE
DONE MOST OF THEM.

36:37.528 --> 36:40.331
NO, I'VE DONE ALL OF THEM.

36:40.364 --> 36:42.367
EVERYTHING I WANTED TO DO.

36:45.202 --> 36:47.773
THINK ABOUT
HOW MANY NEW LISTS
YOU'RE GONNA WRITE

36:47.806 --> 36:50.309
WHEN YOU GET BACK TO BOSTON
AND WE GET YOU BETTER.

36:51.610 --> 36:52.610
RIGHT.

36:55.847 --> 36:57.882
-OH, HEY.
-OH, MY GOD.

36:57.916 --> 37:02.853
BETH, YOU'VE GOT
A LITTLE GELATO... HERE.

37:04.489 --> 37:06.824
WHAT? HMM?

37:08.827 --> 37:10.996
AH. WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO
SO DRESSED UP?

37:11.228 --> 37:15.567
JUST A SEXY EVENING
AT THE NEW ENGLAND
AQUARIUM WITH GREER.

37:15.601 --> 37:18.336
WELL, I'M NOT SURE PICKLE BREATH
IS SUCH A GOOD IDEA

37:18.369 --> 37:20.371
IF YOU'RE GONNA SEE
A FORMER LOVER.

37:20.405 --> 37:23.574
AS YOUR NIECE,
I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU

37:23.608 --> 37:26.711
TO NEVER USE
THE PHRASE "FORMER LOVER"

37:26.744 --> 37:29.614
-IN CASUAL CONVERSATION
EVER AGAIN.
-(chuckles)

37:36.954 --> 37:41.793
-IS SOMETHING WRONG?
-I JUST GOT MY SIX-MONTH UPDATE

37:41.827 --> 37:43.795
ON MY STEM-CELL DONATION.

37:44.829 --> 37:46.965
MY RECIPIENT IS STILL ALIVE.

37:46.998 --> 37:50.402
HE'S A 17-YEAR-OLD MALE
IN BOSTON...

37:51.369 --> 37:53.338
AND HE HAS LYMPHOMA.

37:54.373 --> 37:56.907
DO YOU THINK-- NO.

37:56.942 --> 38:00.378
DOES THAT MEAN THAT-- NO.

38:00.411 --> 38:03.815
-NO, THERE'S NO WAY THAT I'M...
-FINN'S DONOR?

38:05.282 --> 38:06.617
I DON'T KNOW.

38:06.652 --> 38:09.688
I MEAN, THE ODDS ARE
PRETTY IMPOSSIBLE.

38:10.755 --> 38:11.789
WELL, YOU KNOW...

38:12.891 --> 38:14.793
MOST DONORS...

38:14.826 --> 38:17.862
NEVER GET TO SEE
THE GIFT OF LIFE
THEY GIVE THEIR RECIPIENTS.

38:18.829 --> 38:21.632
MAYBE YOU GOT
TO WITNESS IT FIRSTHAND.

38:21.666 --> 38:23.467
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
IT WAS MEANT TO BE.

38:27.005 --> 38:28.673
I HAVE TO GO.

38:31.376 --> 38:33.744
-HEY.
-HI.

38:33.778 --> 38:36.815
WELL, SHE'S IN A HURRY.

38:36.847 --> 38:39.751
-IS SHE GOING TO SEE GREER?
-I AM NOT SURE.

38:40.786 --> 38:43.789
Brenna:
MOM? UNCLE GEORGE?

38:49.427 --> 38:52.030
GEORGE CARVER?
WE'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS.

38:56.867 --> 38:59.036
OKAY, WE'RE LOST.

39:01.505 --> 39:05.510
-ALL RIGHT.
MR. ITALIAN, GO SAVE US.
-ALL RIGHT. I'M ON IT.

39:05.543 --> 39:08.579
(speaking Italian)

39:09.715 --> 39:10.882
WOW.

39:14.052 --> 39:16.954
YOU KNOW, WE'VE ONLY
BEEN HERE A FEW DAYS AND...

39:16.987 --> 39:19.858
GOD, IT CAN REALLY HAVE
AN EFFECT ON YOU.

39:19.891 --> 39:21.827
I HAVEN'T TRAVELED
AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE,

39:21.860 --> 39:24.762
BUT I DEFINITELY SEE
WHAT YOU MEAN.

39:25.764 --> 39:27.733
I WAS LOOKING AT MY PASSPORT
ON THE WAY HERE,

39:27.766 --> 39:30.034
AND I'VE SEEN
SO MUCH OF THE WORLD,

39:31.036 --> 39:35.106
AND YOU KNOW, IT WAS PROBABLY
MOSTLY BECAUSE MY MOM
DIDN'T GET TO TRAVEL.

39:35.139 --> 39:37.775
SHE WAS SO TIED DOWN
TO RAISING US,

39:37.809 --> 39:41.545
AND I SWORE
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT,
AND YET, HERE I AM.

39:43.782 --> 39:45.851
YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE LIKE THAT.

39:45.884 --> 39:49.954
YEAH, I KNOW.
AND YOU KNOW I'M
NOT JUDGEY ABOUT ABORTION,

39:49.987 --> 39:53.759
BUT I'VE SPENT THE PAST YEAR
LOOKING AT LIFE DIFFERENTLY

39:53.791 --> 39:57.596
BECAUSE OF HOW YOU HAVE TO FIGHT
FOR YOURS EVERY SINGLE DAY.

39:57.628 --> 40:01.800
WELL, THERE'S NO
EASY DECISION, IS THERE?

40:01.833 --> 40:03.101
THERE ISN'T.

40:04.969 --> 40:07.405
BUT... I'VE DECIDED.

40:09.074 --> 40:11.842
I GUESS I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN.
I JUST HAD TO PREPARE
MYSELF FOR IT.

40:16.981 --> 40:18.949
(cellphone rings)

40:25.923 --> 40:27.858
YOU WANNA SPLIT A BOTTLE
OF  MONTEPULCIANO ?

40:27.893 --> 40:29.427
YES, PLEASE.

40:31.028 --> 40:33.097
GOD, IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

40:43.641 --> 40:44.876
THANKS.

40:47.846 --> 40:50.081
I COULD DIE HERE.

40:50.114 --> 40:51.849
LITERALLY.

40:54.985 --> 40:57.889
THAT CALL EARLIER
WAS DR. HAMBURG.

40:57.922 --> 41:00.157
AND IT LOOKS LIKE,
GIVEN MY GENOME SAMPLING,

41:00.192 --> 41:04.061
WE MIGHT'VE RUN OUT OF LUCK
WITH EXISTING CLINICAL TRIALS.

41:04.094 --> 41:06.931
SHE WANTS TO SCHEDULE
A TRANSPLANT AS SOON
AS I'M HOME.

41:06.965 --> 41:08.833
IT'S A LAST-DITCH EFFORT.

41:08.867 --> 41:11.902
IF IT COULD KEEP YOU ALIVE,
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.
WE HAVE TO.

41:12.971 --> 41:13.972
DO WE?

41:15.574 --> 41:17.943
BEING HERE,
I'VE REALIZED
WHAT MY FINAL CHAPTER IS.

41:17.976 --> 41:19.777
WE'RE IN IT. IT'S THIS.

41:20.778 --> 41:23.715
I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME
AND HAVE A TRANSPLANT

41:23.748 --> 41:26.918
THAT COULD KILL ME SLOWLY
IN FRONT OF MY FAMILY

41:26.952 --> 41:28.753
AND THE PEOPLE THAT I LOVE.

41:29.954 --> 41:32.090
YOU KNOW, IF--
IF I WERE TO DIE TOMORROW,

41:32.123 --> 41:37.829
I HAVE LIVED MORE IN 25 YEARS
THAN MOST PEOPLE DO IN 70.

41:37.862 --> 41:39.197
YOU CAN'T GIVE UP.

41:40.831 --> 41:44.001
I'M NOT GIVING UP,
BECAUSE I'VE ALREADY WON.

41:45.570 --> 41:47.672
I COULD DIE HAPPY HERE...

41:51.909 --> 41:53.978
LET'S GO GET
A BETTER LOOK
OF THAT SUNSET.

41:54.012 --> 41:56.248
(classical score playing)

42:19.304 --> 42:21.606
(classical score playing)
