WEBVTT

00:01.323 --> 00:02.405
You put him in a coma?

00:02.457 --> 00:04.207
Cryogenic sleep is more accurate.

00:04.242 --> 00:05.708
Welcome to management.

00:05.744 --> 00:07.994
Even if I had the footage
of the things that happened

00:08.045 --> 00:09.295
in your home, Tom, I truly doubt

00:09.331 --> 00:10.330
you'd wanna see it.

00:12.334 --> 00:13.466
Who's Edgar L. Abbot?

00:13.501 --> 00:15.385
I don't know. But we need to find him.

00:15.420 --> 00:17.470
Good, we are all here.

00:17.505 --> 00:20.089
You bought a gun to kill Arthur.

00:22.344 --> 00:24.010
I'm a better person than them.

00:24.062 --> 00:25.144
Charlie...

00:25.180 --> 00:26.346
Aaugh!

00:26.348 --> 00:29.432
Ohhhh!

Who are you?

01:13.228 --> 01:15.028
Ohhh!

01:19.401 --> 01:20.984
What are you?

01:25.123 --> 01:26.239
I'm home.

01:41.389 --> 01:45.008
Back off him! Now!

01:47.095 --> 01:50.063
Back! Off! Now!

02:11.369 --> 02:13.169
We've got a body in here!

02:30.388 --> 02:32.472
He lied about everything.

02:32.474 --> 02:38.111
That stupid freezer.
His visions. Him and Charlie.

02:38.146 --> 02:40.446
How does she even know him?

02:40.482 --> 02:42.315
You said she was in a coma.

02:42.367 --> 02:44.033
And she mentioned my grandfather,

02:44.069 --> 02:46.285
so she has to know him
from his research.

02:48.239 --> 02:50.239
Are Th... Are there others?

02:50.291 --> 02:51.324
Like Holden?

02:51.376 --> 02:54.377
I know Arthur's been at this
for a really long time.

02:54.412 --> 02:57.213
But he's never mentioned
anything about a Charlie.

02:57.248 --> 02:59.415
Doesn't mean they don't
know one another.

03:01.086 --> 03:03.970
Do you think she's the one
that broke into his house?

03:04.005 --> 03:05.171
I...

03:07.142 --> 03:08.975
I really don't know.

03:11.396 --> 03:14.230
I'm so sorry you got
dragged into all of this.

03:14.265 --> 03:16.399
I dragged myself into this.

03:17.485 --> 03:19.318
I... I couldn't live with you thinking

03:19.354 --> 03:21.404
that you're better at
Mortal Kombat than me.

03:24.275 --> 03:26.159
Why do you care what I think?

03:27.278 --> 03:31.330
Things have been so hard lately.

03:31.366 --> 03:34.033
And you didn't have to be there for me.

03:34.085 --> 03:35.084
But you were.

03:36.371 --> 03:37.420
Thank you.

03:39.174 --> 03:41.207
Ah, it's nothing. Heh.

03:41.209 --> 03:43.042
It's not nothing.

03:48.383 --> 03:50.216
I think we need to stop.

03:52.387 --> 03:54.437
Sorry, I just mean that I...

03:56.107 --> 03:59.058
I think we should stop
seeing each other.

04:01.446 --> 04:02.395
Why?

04:03.448 --> 04:06.199
Given the circumstances,

04:06.234 --> 04:09.368
I just think that maybe...

04:09.404 --> 04:12.038
this isn't the best idea.

04:12.073 --> 04:13.956
What circumstances?

04:13.992 --> 04:16.075
- Willa...
- What circumstances?

04:17.295 --> 04:19.995
I like you.

04:20.048 --> 04:22.165
And not in like a...

04:22.217 --> 04:24.383
you're cool and you're my friend

04:24.419 --> 04:25.418
kinda way.

04:27.088 --> 04:30.306
You're... beautiful.

04:32.093 --> 04:35.428
And... mysterious, and smart as hell,

04:35.430 --> 04:37.146
and like a total badass,

04:37.182 --> 04:39.315
and, like, a million times
more interesting

04:39.350 --> 04:42.268
than the entire population
of Fort Reed combined.

04:43.488 --> 04:47.440
And I just think that I would be
a complete piece of garbage

04:47.442 --> 04:50.243
if I let this go any further.

04:52.113 --> 04:56.032
Holden may be acting
like a tool right now...

04:56.084 --> 04:58.334
I mean, he's definitely
acting like a tool right now.

04:59.420 --> 05:01.120
But he's still my brother.

05:04.292 --> 05:05.291
I can't.

05:16.204 --> 05:18.137
Could you just say something?

05:19.974 --> 05:21.107
Please?

05:23.978 --> 05:26.145
I'm such an idiot.

05:26.147 --> 05:28.030
No. No, you're not.

05:29.067 --> 05:30.066
Willa...

05:48.386 --> 05:50.002
Listen...

05:51.172 --> 05:54.006
I know you're not the instigator here.

05:54.008 --> 05:56.008
Couple of kids in the parking
lot saw the guy go in

05:56.060 --> 05:57.343
and attack the manager.

05:57.395 --> 05:59.428
I saw how he was wailing on you.

05:59.480 --> 06:01.347
So if you're worried about
incriminating yourself...

06:01.349 --> 06:03.015
I don't know who he is, Sheriff.

06:03.017 --> 06:05.017
Holden!

06:05.069 --> 06:06.209
Sorry.

06:11.359 --> 06:13.242
Did you know that there are
people in this town

06:13.278 --> 06:17.163
that I only ever see at pancake dinners.

06:17.198 --> 06:18.414
This stuff just keeps finding me.

06:18.449 --> 06:19.949
I can't help it.

06:20.001 --> 06:21.367
Why?

06:21.369 --> 06:24.337
Why does this stuff keep finding you?

06:24.372 --> 06:27.123
Just tell me what's going on,
I can help.

06:29.210 --> 06:31.043
Really wish I could, Sheriff.

06:32.380 --> 06:33.429
I swear.

06:33.464 --> 06:35.047
Okay.

06:36.384 --> 06:38.351
Well, don't go disappearing on me.

06:38.386 --> 06:41.053
Might need to talk to you again.

06:41.055 --> 06:43.139
- I'm free to go?
- Yeah.

06:44.442 --> 06:48.227
Make sure you tell your folks
what happened tonight.

06:48.279 --> 06:51.230
No one likes a late night
phone call from the police.

06:51.232 --> 06:52.231
I will, sir.

06:56.371 --> 07:00.323
Actually, um, there is...
one thing you could do to help.

07:01.993 --> 07:02.958
What's that?

07:05.413 --> 07:07.963
Could I talk to him?

07:07.999 --> 07:10.249
He came after me.

07:10.251 --> 07:12.335
Maybe I can get him to tell me why.

07:18.226 --> 07:20.092
Five minutes.

07:20.144 --> 07:22.178
Don't antagonize him.

07:51.125 --> 07:52.375
What's your name?

07:55.346 --> 07:57.046
What do you want with me?

08:00.218 --> 08:01.934
We want to thank you.

08:03.271 --> 08:04.353
For what?

08:04.389 --> 08:06.305
You entered a forbidden world.

08:07.442 --> 08:09.975
Molded it, bent it, broke it.

08:11.145 --> 08:12.311
You freed us.

08:13.364 --> 08:15.981
And now we've come to this world.

08:16.033 --> 08:20.069
We've come to mold it,
to bend it, break it.

08:20.121 --> 08:22.071
We've come to make it our own.

08:32.332 --> 08:34.166
You're from the Realm.

08:36.337 --> 08:37.385
Are you alone?

08:40.006 --> 08:41.173
We are many.

08:42.342 --> 08:44.176
We are everywhere.

08:48.316 --> 08:50.433
Would you like to see what I see?

08:59.026 --> 09:00.192
You see?

09:27.188 --> 09:29.188
Everything you love will be dust!

09:29.223 --> 09:32.141
Your world will become our world!

09:32.193 --> 09:34.109
There's no stopping it now!

09:34.145 --> 09:35.394
Let him go! Hey!

09:37.365 --> 09:39.949
Hey...

09:39.984 --> 09:41.033
come on.

09:56.398 --> 09:57.564
Whoa...

09:57.745 --> 10:01.435
Did you get your face stuck in
the ball return after we left?

10:01.487 --> 10:03.403
Yeah. Almost.

10:03.439 --> 10:05.489
How... how'd you know I was here?

10:05.524 --> 10:07.491
I saw the cops breakin'
the sound barrier

10:07.526 --> 10:09.526
headed toward the bowling alley.

10:09.528 --> 10:11.445
Went back to check it out.

10:13.365 --> 10:15.582
Who did that to your face?

10:15.618 --> 10:17.584
You mean what.

10:17.620 --> 10:20.504
I think he's... it's... from the Realm.

10:22.458 --> 10:24.591
That stuff I've been telling you?

10:24.627 --> 10:25.676
My dreams?

10:25.711 --> 10:28.679
Visions? That... feeling I've had

10:28.714 --> 10:30.714
that something's about to go wrong?

10:30.766 --> 10:33.300
It's all happening. It's real!

10:34.720 --> 10:37.387
What? You don't believe me?

10:37.439 --> 10:39.690
Of course I believe you.
This is what I've been talking about...

10:39.725 --> 10:42.392
- Charlie...
- Don't "Charlie" me!

10:43.729 --> 10:46.563
Run away with me!

10:46.599 --> 10:49.383
Okay, gas up and get the hell
outta here.

10:49.418 --> 10:50.400
I'll even let you drive.

10:50.452 --> 10:52.536
- That's not funny.
- I'm not kidding.

10:52.571 --> 10:55.405
If what you're saying
is anything close to true,

10:55.441 --> 10:58.575
the only way I know how to help you
is to get you away from here.

11:00.329 --> 11:02.579
Okay, fine. Go alone.

11:02.581 --> 11:05.249
Just get out of Fort Reed.

11:05.251 --> 11:08.226
Okay? Change your name, dye
your hair, whatever you gotta do

11:08.226 --> 11:10.671
to leave this behind forever.

11:10.723 --> 11:14.424
Holden, I'm literally asking you

11:14.426 --> 11:15.475
not to answer the call right now.

11:15.511 --> 11:17.261
- I have to.
- No, you don't!

11:17.313 --> 11:19.263
Stop acting like this is
about protecting me!

11:19.265 --> 11:20.347
What the hell else would it be about?

11:20.399 --> 11:22.399
You're scared.

11:22.434 --> 11:26.486
Okay. That's not funny.

11:26.522 --> 11:30.440
This is what you do. Charlie,
you don't fix problems.

11:30.492 --> 11:31.692
You displace them.

11:33.329 --> 11:35.362
What... Uh, hiding your sister.

11:35.414 --> 11:37.281
Avoiding me.

11:37.283 --> 11:39.700
Fooling yourself into thinking you're
gonna come here to kill Arthur,

11:39.752 --> 11:43.503
but problems just keep
finding you, don't they?

11:45.591 --> 11:49.593
That... thing in there,
it's not gonna stop.

11:49.628 --> 11:51.628
So neither can I.

11:55.801 --> 11:57.517
Hey, Jeff.

11:57.553 --> 11:59.720
Hey, I found out who Edgar Abbot is.

11:59.772 --> 12:01.638
But we're gonna have
to take a field trip.

12:01.690 --> 12:04.274
Field trip? â€­What'd you find out?

12:05.477 --> 12:06.560
I'll explain it on the way.

12:06.612 --> 12:08.528
Meet me in an hour.
I'll text you the details.

12:08.564 --> 12:10.230
I'll see you then.

12:13.485 --> 12:17.454
Look, you do... whatever you want.

12:17.489 --> 12:20.457
Jeff and I are gonna figure out
what's wrong with that freezer,

12:20.492 --> 12:23.543
and then, we're gonna see about
that guy that attacked me.

12:23.579 --> 12:25.462
You're an idiot, Holden.

12:26.498 --> 12:28.665
Yeah. Probably.

12:31.553 --> 12:33.503
Will you be here when I get back?

12:43.432 --> 12:45.349
I'd tell you to say hi
to your folks for me,

12:45.401 --> 12:47.567
but... I don't think
they like me very much.

12:47.603 --> 12:52.272
Yeah, well, Kevin didn't
exactly sing your praises.

12:52.324 --> 12:53.657
I'm gonna talk to them.

12:53.692 --> 12:55.692
You know, you've really been there
for us for the past few weeks,

12:55.744 --> 12:57.277
and they should know that.

12:58.497 --> 12:59.529
Thanks.

13:02.501 --> 13:03.842
I think while you're at your parents,

13:03.842 --> 13:05.832
Holden and I are gonna take a road trip.

13:07.256 --> 13:08.588
Promise me you'll be careful.

13:10.626 --> 13:13.377
I'll be here when you
and Landon come back.

13:19.685 --> 13:21.685
So I spoke to Pastor Ian.

13:24.440 --> 13:25.472
Yeah?

13:25.557 --> 13:28.392
Uh, he and Helping Hands
invited me on a retreat.

13:31.530 --> 13:33.313
It's just a ranch.

13:33.365 --> 13:35.918
They do group therapy,
activities, Kumbaya.

13:35.918 --> 13:38.384
They said Landon could come.

13:39.655 --> 13:41.455
They even invited you.

13:43.575 --> 13:45.625
I'll... I'll think about it.

13:48.330 --> 13:51.331
Can we talk about it when we're
all back home in a couple days?

13:51.383 --> 13:52.416
Yeah, of course.

13:53.419 --> 13:54.551
Go do your thing.

13:54.586 --> 13:56.503
We'll see you when you get back.

13:56.555 --> 13:58.472
Thanks.

13:58.507 --> 14:00.424
What were you thinking?

14:00.476 --> 14:03.343
Diane, Ian is a creep. All right?

14:03.395 --> 14:05.429
- You know what he said?
- Did anyone see you?

14:05.431 --> 14:07.264
His secretary was there.

14:07.316 --> 14:09.433
The chatterbox... she was
gone by the time I left.

14:09.485 --> 14:10.517
And Ian?

14:10.569 --> 14:13.487
He's fine, he's just
missing a few teeth.

14:13.522 --> 14:16.406
He baited me. That son of a bitch,

14:16.442 --> 14:17.657
he wanted me to hit him.

14:19.661 --> 14:22.362
Yeah. He thought he did.

14:24.450 --> 14:28.668
Believe me... Ian's not the kind
of guy who can take a hit.

14:28.704 --> 14:31.538
Yeah. I think he found
that out pretty quick.

14:32.708 --> 14:34.458
You know we have to fix this.

14:34.510 --> 14:37.711
Yeah... that's why I'm goin'
to the Sheriff's office.

14:37.763 --> 14:39.429
You're joking, right?

14:39.465 --> 14:40.680
You have a prior assault charge, Tom,

14:40.716 --> 14:43.383
and you just beat up the town pastor.

14:43.435 --> 14:45.469
- No. I'll go.
- Diane, listen to me.

14:45.521 --> 14:47.437
It can't look like I'm hiding.

14:47.473 --> 14:49.272
Okay? If I own up to it,

14:49.308 --> 14:51.381
pull off the Band-Aid,
and it shows that we're

14:51.381 --> 14:52.433
not hiding anything,

14:52.478 --> 14:55.395
then we can talk openly
about that creep hiding cameras

14:55.447 --> 14:58.315
and spying on my wife and my two sons.

14:58.317 --> 15:00.317
And what? I just wait here?

15:00.369 --> 15:02.319
No, no, no, you hold down the fort.

15:02.321 --> 15:05.655
Diane, look. I hated the fact that
you and Ian were gonna

15:05.657 --> 15:08.325
get back together.
Even though it wasn't for real.

15:09.495 --> 15:12.212
I should've supported you
like you supported me.

15:12.247 --> 15:15.499
I messed up. All right?

15:15.501 --> 15:16.666
Let me fix it.

15:18.303 --> 15:19.336
Okay.

15:23.675 --> 15:26.343
Expenses remain
manageable at the moment.

15:26.395 --> 15:27.844
We've been able to fudge the numbers

15:27.846 --> 15:30.742
and hide operating costs
for the facility inside food

15:30.742 --> 15:32.400
and kitchen expenses.

15:32.401 --> 15:34.651
As for the patients, things are
looking pretty normal,

15:34.686 --> 15:37.237
save for some slight
fluctuations in vital signs

15:37.272 --> 15:38.355
this morning.

15:49.451 --> 15:51.585
- Excuse me, Mr...
- What do you want?

15:51.620 --> 15:53.537
There's a situation in Fort Reed.

15:53.589 --> 15:55.255
I've tried multiple times
to get in touch

15:55.290 --> 15:57.541
with Ms. Shoemacher, but she's
incommunicado right now.

15:57.543 --> 15:59.342
What kind of situation?

16:03.682 --> 16:05.298
Understood.

16:05.350 --> 16:07.217
Don't worry about bothering
Ms. Shoemacher with this.

16:07.219 --> 16:09.636
I know Fort Reed better than she does.
I'll handle the situation.

16:09.688 --> 16:11.521
But... Sir, you haven't
been doing this very long.

16:11.557 --> 16:14.391
- I think that...
- No, George. You don't think.

16:14.393 --> 16:17.611
You get Ms. Shoemacher her lattes.

16:17.646 --> 16:19.563
I said I'll handle the situation.

16:19.615 --> 16:20.564
Yes, sir.

16:23.318 --> 16:24.618
What about your orientation?

16:33.378 --> 16:34.578
Have a good trip.

16:34.580 --> 16:36.580
Thank you.

16:36.632 --> 16:38.298
I will.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.211
Morning, friend.

17:01.087 --> 17:02.253
Ahh...

17:02.305 --> 17:04.005
Morning.

17:05.141 --> 17:06.340
Anything I can help you with?

17:08.144 --> 17:11.229
Looks like you've had a rough night.

17:11.263 --> 17:13.981
Well, it's nothing you need
to concern yourself with.

17:15.352 --> 17:18.236
As fate would have it,
it's the reason I'm here.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.405
I'm visiting on behalf of Hollow Sky.

17:24.993 --> 17:27.362
They, um... They got my message?

17:27.414 --> 17:29.280
You're one of the flock.

17:29.332 --> 17:32.116
We'd never leave you for the wolves.

17:32.168 --> 17:36.037
Well, it's, uh...
it's great to meet you.

17:36.089 --> 17:38.206
Ian. And you are...?

17:39.259 --> 17:41.342
It's not important.

17:41.378 --> 17:45.096
What is important is that you
give me a little more information.

17:45.131 --> 17:46.381
Oh, whatever you need.

17:48.218 --> 17:50.385
How did Diane Matthews
find out about the cameras?

17:52.272 --> 17:57.358
Well... between you and me,
the people your people sent over

17:57.394 --> 18:02.980
to install the cameras... they weren't
exactly the most discreet.

18:03.032 --> 18:04.148
Ohh.

18:07.203 --> 18:09.237
Did you access the feed yourself?

18:13.042 --> 18:16.294
I'm a bit of a Luddite, to be honest.

18:16.329 --> 18:19.130
And I would never violate
her family's privacy...

18:20.166 --> 18:21.416
well, like that.

18:23.169 --> 18:25.386
And you didn't make copies
of those feeds?

18:25.422 --> 18:27.305
Save 'em onto your computer
or hard drive?

18:27.340 --> 18:32.059
Uh, like I said, my friend,
I wouldn't even know how.

18:32.095 --> 18:34.262
And if there were copies,
they would disappear?

18:36.399 --> 18:39.400
You'd be surprised how
easily things can disappear.

18:45.108 --> 18:46.324
I understand.

18:46.359 --> 18:48.025
Do you?

18:53.116 --> 18:54.282
I do.

19:02.125 --> 19:04.208
It was great to meet you, Pastor.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.011
We'll be in touch.

19:21.060 --> 19:22.193
Come on...

19:22.228 --> 19:23.978
come on, where are you,
you little bastards?

19:26.449 --> 19:27.982
Mom?

19:35.124 --> 19:37.992
Honey... we should talk.

19:39.379 --> 19:44.966
Your dad and I have been up to...
a lot that we haven't told you about.

19:46.135 --> 19:49.003
We've been talking to the FBI.

19:49.005 --> 19:50.338
You, what?

19:50.390 --> 19:53.391
Pastor Ian isn't who he says he is.

19:53.426 --> 19:56.310
He belongs to some cult
called Hollow Sky.

19:57.347 --> 19:59.263
And the FBI is investigating them.

19:59.315 --> 20:03.150
They told us that there are some people
who have gone missing,

20:03.186 --> 20:06.020
and they think that this
cult is responsible.

20:06.022 --> 20:10.324
And... we're helping because it
seems that Hollow Sky...

20:10.360 --> 20:13.411
has shown interest in Holden.

20:13.446 --> 20:18.332
So, what... are you, like, the Mata Hari
for the FBI or something?

20:18.368 --> 20:20.418
Luke, they put cameras in our house.

20:22.171 --> 20:25.039
Your father's gone to talk to
the Sheriff as we speak.

20:28.211 --> 20:30.461
So, you and... Dad...

20:30.513 --> 20:33.214
have been doing... all of this

20:33.266 --> 20:38.386
because you think a cult has
some weird interest in Holden?

20:38.388 --> 20:42.023
Heh... Maybe you should be
talkin' to him right now.

20:42.058 --> 20:43.107
No, I... I don't want him to worry.

20:43.142 --> 20:44.559
He... He's not a kid anymore.

20:44.561 --> 20:47.278
I mean, have you ever thought that
maybe he's keeping things from you?

20:50.066 --> 20:52.066
Why would he do that?

20:52.068 --> 20:55.202
Because he's not as helpless
as you think he is.

20:55.238 --> 20:59.206
But you know, God forbid he be held
responsible for anything, right?

20:59.242 --> 21:02.076
- Luke...
- No, Mom, look at you.

21:02.128 --> 21:05.567
You were just smashing
family photos in our dining room

21:05.567 --> 21:09.182
looking for cameras. I mean, have you
spent any time at all wondering

21:09.182 --> 21:10.085
what Holden's been up to?

21:10.086 --> 21:12.420
Why are we all so worried
about protecting his feelings?

21:12.422 --> 21:13.421
Luke!

21:18.478 --> 21:20.227
I'm sorry.

21:34.444 --> 21:36.444
Dr. Francis Chang?

21:38.114 --> 21:39.330
Short notice.

21:42.168 --> 21:44.285
You doin' okay with the, uh...?

21:45.288 --> 21:48.289
Uh, yeah, it's a... it's fine.

21:48.291 --> 21:50.374
Is there somethin'
we need to be worryin' about?

21:50.426 --> 21:53.210
Do we need to storm the
Sheriff's station or somethin'?

21:53.262 --> 21:55.046
Let's call that Plan B.

21:55.098 --> 21:56.380
First we have to talk to this Edgar guy.

21:56.432 --> 21:59.016
- Hm.
- Find out what he knows.

22:00.353 --> 22:03.971
You think that guy that attacked you
and the freezer are related?

22:06.142 --> 22:10.027
Doctor... Chang?

22:10.063 --> 22:12.113
That's me.

22:12.148 --> 22:14.231
And this is my research assistant.

22:14.283 --> 22:15.316
Warren.

22:17.236 --> 22:20.204
I'm Dr. Tolan, Edgar's
head doctor. Shall we?

22:20.239 --> 22:21.322
We shall.

22:23.126 --> 22:26.377
You're not part of the regular
Hollow Sky rotation, Dr. Chang.

22:26.412 --> 22:30.381
Ms. Shoemacher felt it necessary to
send someone she really trusted.

22:30.416 --> 22:32.466
She unsatisfied with the
care we're providing?

22:32.502 --> 22:35.386
She's just being thorough.

22:35.421 --> 22:39.473
Well, as I'm sure you're aware,
Mr. Abbot has been docile for years.

22:39.509 --> 22:42.513
Never caused trouble.
Yet, over the past month

22:42.513 --> 22:44.229
he's become quite a handful.

22:44.230 --> 22:47.264
Scaring the orderlies, babbling
about an imaginary friend

22:47.316 --> 22:49.350
he's named "Holden Matthews."

22:49.402 --> 22:53.104
Starting fires, which, as you can
imagine, have been a serious problem.

22:53.156 --> 22:56.190
But here's what concerns
me. These fires?

22:56.242 --> 22:58.409
We can never seem
to find the point of origin.

22:58.444 --> 23:00.194
We've taken every
precaution to no avail,

23:00.246 --> 23:03.330
so, I've been exploring
some extracurricular research.

23:03.366 --> 23:06.951
There's interesting work out there
by a man named Arthur Forman.

23:07.003 --> 23:10.619
It's mostly fringe science,
but he posits that there

23:10.619 --> 23:13.040
are people out there who awake
from comas with the ability

23:13.092 --> 23:16.093
to manipulate the physical world
using their minds.

23:16.129 --> 23:19.380
You think Edgar can
start fires with his mind?

23:19.432 --> 23:22.099
We call it pyrokinesis.

23:22.135 --> 23:25.386
And that's Arthur Forman's hypothesis?

23:25.388 --> 23:27.138
It's Stephen King.

23:29.225 --> 23:31.275
Look, I am acutely aware
of how bizarre it sounds,

23:31.310 --> 23:34.028
but I can only theorize
based on my experience.

23:35.064 --> 23:36.363
See for yourself, Dr. Chang.

23:50.163 --> 23:52.413
So try not to let him get agitated.

23:52.415 --> 23:57.084
And if he does start a fire...
do me a favor and take some notes.

23:59.255 --> 24:00.304
Thank you.

24:08.347 --> 24:10.314
Edgar?

24:10.349 --> 24:14.268
Hey... do you mind if we talk?

24:14.320 --> 24:16.187
Uh...

24:16.239 --> 24:17.238
Edgar?

24:19.358 --> 24:20.991
You in there?

24:35.041 --> 24:38.008
Hey... it's me.

24:38.044 --> 24:39.460
Holden Matthews.

24:50.022 --> 24:54.308
They're here... aren't they?

25:11.812 --> 25:14.780
Hey. You still got time
to make a statement?

25:15.866 --> 25:17.399
You okay?

25:18.736 --> 25:20.402
Yeah.

25:22.406 --> 25:23.572
Deputy Franklin.

25:24.875 --> 25:30.629
Chaaaaaarlie...

25:40.891 --> 25:42.641
I know, I know, but...

25:51.819 --> 25:56.945
Chaaaaaarlie...

26:12.157 --> 26:17.293
Admit it... you're better
off without her.

26:26.187 --> 26:27.970
Without who?

26:54.215 --> 26:56.048
Anabelle.

27:10.899 --> 27:13.850
Ohhh...

27:25.363 --> 27:28.915
It's so, so good to talk to someone

27:28.950 --> 27:31.250
beside those Hollow Sky Moonies.

27:31.286 --> 27:33.730
They've been trying
to get the freezer's location

27:33.730 --> 27:37.123
out of me for so long.
Years, I... I think.

27:37.175 --> 27:39.175
I'm just so, so glad to hear
you found it first.

27:39.210 --> 27:41.961
I knew that would happen
if I just trusted you, Holden.

27:42.013 --> 27:45.882
I saw it each and every time I shut
my eyes, I Ne... I never broke.

27:45.934 --> 27:48.267
Never. 'Cause I knew
this day would come.

27:48.303 --> 27:52.021
Edgar... how do you know my name?

27:52.056 --> 27:53.890
He told me.

27:53.892 --> 27:54.891
Who?

27:56.060 --> 27:57.226
The man in my head.

27:59.280 --> 28:01.113
So, what's with this freezer?

28:01.149 --> 28:03.950
Why'd you bury it in the woods?

28:03.985 --> 28:05.201
So they wouldn't find it.

28:11.042 --> 28:13.960
The freezer takes you to the Realm.

28:13.995 --> 28:17.880
It's the only way you,
and me, and everyone,

28:17.916 --> 28:19.882
will survive what's coming.

28:19.918 --> 28:21.300
And what's coming?

28:21.386 --> 28:25.254
You were attacked by a being
that crossed over, right?

28:25.306 --> 28:26.973
How do you know that?

28:28.893 --> 28:30.092
Right.

28:30.144 --> 28:35.264
Okay, so, the thing that attacked me.
Wh... What does it want?

28:35.266 --> 28:37.149
What does cancer want?

28:37.185 --> 28:42.271
It wants to grow, overtake, survive,
by any means necessary.

28:42.323 --> 28:45.274
Uh, wait, just...

28:45.276 --> 28:47.944
back up to this voice in your head.

28:47.996 --> 28:52.865
The Realm has a funny way
of communicating.

28:52.917 --> 28:55.952
It stays with you. Some hear voices,

28:56.004 --> 29:00.039
others see images, symbols.

29:00.091 --> 29:03.175
The Realm wants to be heard.

29:03.211 --> 29:07.129
But only a select few
are capable of truly listening.

29:07.131 --> 29:10.132
You've been experiencing
parasomnia, right?

29:10.184 --> 29:13.052
- Para who?
- Somnia.

29:13.104 --> 29:18.190
Somnambulism. That state between
sleep and consciousness,

29:18.226 --> 29:21.277
tapping into a state of existence
that's typically only achievable

29:21.312 --> 29:26.198
through the use of hallucinogenic drugs
or extreme starvation.

29:26.234 --> 29:29.902
It's classic. Ancient.

29:29.954 --> 29:33.072
Norse seidr, Persian ascetics...

29:33.124 --> 29:34.874
indigenous cultures of the Americas,

29:34.909 --> 29:37.326
and... and the Pacific,
Greek priestesses,

29:37.328 --> 29:41.213
Victorian spiritualists,
hippie kids in the desert.

29:41.249 --> 29:44.166
We're driven by this desperate need

29:44.168 --> 29:46.085
to seek out that state of consciousness

29:46.137 --> 29:49.005
and achieve some form of enlightenment.

29:49.057 --> 29:50.339
And now, here we are.

29:52.176 --> 29:54.310
Bunch of unlucky mortals
who bumped our heads

29:54.345 --> 29:56.345
and opened the floodgates.

29:56.347 --> 29:59.231
Visions of freezers and farm boys
dancing through our minds.

29:59.267 --> 30:01.183
I'm not a farm boy.

30:03.104 --> 30:07.073
Bit tardy, aren't we? Your
associates are already with Edgar.

30:08.276 --> 30:10.026
Our associates?

30:10.028 --> 30:13.029
Dr. Chang and his assistant.

30:13.081 --> 30:17.366
We've gotta use that freezer
to block more of 'em from comin' over.

30:17.368 --> 30:22.488
Hollow Sky in their supreme
"death is just the beginning"

30:22.488 --> 30:24.174
idiocy have used that machine

30:24.175 --> 30:28.044
to go places no regular person
should be allowed to go.

30:28.096 --> 30:30.012
The worlds must remain separate.

30:30.048 --> 30:33.015
So... So you're familiar
with Arthur Forman's theories.

30:33.051 --> 30:34.967
Uh, yeah, you could say that.

30:35.019 --> 30:36.302
Hey, guys?

30:36.354 --> 30:38.270
I think our cover's about to get blown.

30:42.226 --> 30:44.944
Hollow Sky goons
here for their weekly visit.

30:44.979 --> 30:46.362
Why'd we come here
the same day as Hollow Sky?

30:46.397 --> 30:48.898
Hey, I told you, I had pretty
damn short notice.

30:48.950 --> 30:51.446
Okay, wait... Edgar, what else
can you tell us about the thing

30:51.446 --> 30:53.369
that attacked me? What does
it want? How do we kill it?

30:53.404 --> 30:55.204
- Follow your dreams.
- Back door.

30:55.239 --> 30:58.324
- But we're gonna need a...
- A distraction? Easy peasy.

31:01.129 --> 31:02.244
Fire!

31:02.296 --> 31:03.329
Oh, no!

31:03.381 --> 31:04.964
Let's go, come on!

31:14.092 --> 31:15.257
We can't just leave him here.

31:15.309 --> 31:17.259
There's not much else
we can do here, man.

31:17.261 --> 31:18.928
We gotta come back for him.

31:25.319 --> 31:27.937
Annabelle, pick up, you little brat.

31:27.989 --> 31:31.107
Come on. Pick up.

31:40.034 --> 31:42.918
You broke into my grandfather's house.

31:42.954 --> 31:44.203
You're going to tell me why.

31:53.513 --> 31:54.629
Sit down.

32:05.358 --> 32:06.524
What's the gun for?

32:10.280 --> 32:13.197
I brought it in case
Arthur got an itch on his back.

32:14.484 --> 32:16.484
You think you're cute, don't you?

32:16.536 --> 32:19.320
I do, actually.

32:19.372 --> 32:20.655
I should go to the police.

32:20.707 --> 32:23.407
Something tells me
that's not in your nature.

32:24.661 --> 32:26.494
Why do you hate him?

32:27.580 --> 32:30.331
You're kidding, right?

32:30.383 --> 32:32.416
He gave up so much for people like you.

32:32.468 --> 32:35.219
His relationship with his family... me.

32:35.255 --> 32:37.725
Man, I bet the boys really
eat up your whole wounded,

32:37.725 --> 32:40.406
exotic flower thing, don't they?

32:40.406 --> 32:43.477
As opposed to that
aloof, bad-girl facade?

32:43.513 --> 32:47.315
So, did you intentionally act as a
honeypot for Holden in the Realm?

32:47.350 --> 32:50.351
Pretty granddaughter there to
make the teenage boy stick around?

32:50.353 --> 32:51.686
Holden wanted to help us.

32:51.688 --> 32:53.354
Just because you couldn't handle it.

32:53.356 --> 32:55.573
Like you have any idea
what Holden wanted.

32:55.608 --> 32:57.441
Oh, and you do?

32:57.493 --> 33:01.195
Why? Because you're special, like him?

33:01.247 --> 33:04.582
Special?

33:04.617 --> 33:08.369
Yes, a very special little suicidal kid

33:08.371 --> 33:10.588
who went and put herself in a coma?

33:10.623 --> 33:15.543
Yeah. You know, when I found
myself in the Realm,

33:15.595 --> 33:21.549
Arthur made me feel like I could
finally be safe. Finally belong.

33:21.551 --> 33:25.303
Until he realized I couldn't
get him what he wanted.

33:25.355 --> 33:28.689
Couldn't help him win
his little fight with Frost.

33:28.725 --> 33:33.694
So he dropped me. And when I woke up?

33:33.730 --> 33:36.480
He ghosted. Poof.

33:36.532 --> 33:39.138
So I drifted from foster
home to foster home,

33:39.138 --> 33:41.071
some nice, some not so nice.

33:41.537 --> 33:45.456
Then I fell in with Hollow Sky
and Frost, because I had nothing else.

33:45.491 --> 33:49.243
And the whole time, I had to figure out
how to bridge the time

33:49.295 --> 33:51.245
I lost in my coma.

33:51.297 --> 33:55.249
Figure out how to navigate
these ridiculous powers I woke up with.

33:55.301 --> 33:56.584
Figure out how to survive!

33:56.636 --> 34:00.588
It all felt very special. Believe me.

34:04.594 --> 34:08.396
Arthur... destroyed my life.

34:09.565 --> 34:12.266
So I wanted to destroy his.

34:14.237 --> 34:15.319
But he's not dead.

34:16.406 --> 34:17.571
You didn't go through with it.

34:19.409 --> 34:20.408
Why?

34:21.610 --> 34:23.494
You're gonna have
to put that gun to my head

34:23.529 --> 34:25.446
if you want an answer to that one.

34:29.619 --> 34:32.203
You got scared. Didn't you?

34:32.255 --> 34:34.621
What is with you guys,
accusing me of being scared,

34:34.674 --> 34:36.623
like it's some character flaw?

34:36.626 --> 34:39.627
Holden nearly got killed
last night by some Realm defector

34:39.629 --> 34:42.295
you and your grandpa unleashed,
and you're gonna sit here and...

34:42.348 --> 34:43.681
Wait... What are you talking about?

34:43.716 --> 34:45.349
Someone tried to kill him?

34:46.636 --> 34:48.302
Is he okay?

34:51.306 --> 34:52.639
You don't know, do you?

34:54.560 --> 34:56.610
You're gonna wanna sit back down.

34:59.532 --> 35:02.283
Do you wanna know what happened or not?

35:11.494 --> 35:13.661
Can I have my gun back?

35:13.663 --> 35:16.163
You called me a honeypot.

35:18.468 --> 35:19.500
Fine.

35:25.508 --> 35:27.258
All right. All right, listen...

35:27.310 --> 35:30.172
I... I'm sure the Sheriff's
got his hands full dealing

35:30.172 --> 35:32.480
with noise complaints or something,
but I need to see him now.

35:32.515 --> 35:34.515
And I'm telling you if you
sign in, I'll let him know.

35:34.567 --> 35:37.568
Damn it! I'm tryin'
to turn myself in here.

35:37.603 --> 35:39.403
I have information
on Pastor Ian Brachman,

35:39.439 --> 35:41.355
and I need to speak to Dayton now.

35:41.407 --> 35:45.359
Tom... Holden's fine, we've got
the guy behind bars.

35:47.363 --> 35:50.414
Holden? What guy?

35:50.450 --> 35:52.249
What happened?

35:52.285 --> 35:55.336
I told him to talk to you.

35:55.371 --> 35:57.288
He was out bowling
with his friends last night

35:57.340 --> 36:00.591
when a guy showed up and attacked him.

36:00.626 --> 36:02.426
Where's Holden?

36:02.462 --> 36:04.261
Is he okay? Is he here? Now?

36:04.297 --> 36:07.298
We let him go hours ago.
He's fine, but...

36:07.350 --> 36:10.301
this guy that attacked him,
we put some feelers out.

36:10.353 --> 36:13.354
He's wanted for questioning
in regard to the death of his parents.

36:13.389 --> 36:15.272
In Argentina.

36:17.443 --> 36:21.228
I wanna see him. I wanna see
the kid who attacked my son.

36:21.280 --> 36:22.530
That's not a good idea.

36:22.565 --> 36:25.316
Sheriff? That's him.

36:25.368 --> 36:27.234
The man who attacked Pastor Ian.

36:27.286 --> 36:28.369
Tom, what's she talking about?

36:28.404 --> 36:30.654
Just look at his hand.

36:30.706 --> 36:33.240
Maybe you should come with me,
Mr. Matthews.

36:33.242 --> 36:36.243
No. Not until I see the bastard
who attacked my son.

36:37.413 --> 36:39.380
Tell your deputy to get
his hands off of me, John.

36:39.415 --> 36:40.631
Tom, just go with him, okay?

36:40.666 --> 36:42.383
- Let go!
- Hey!

36:42.418 --> 36:43.634
- Relax!
- Aah! Let go! Aah!

36:43.669 --> 36:44.668
- Let's go!
- Relax, Tom.

36:44.720 --> 36:46.554
Let go of me, I wanna see him!

36:46.589 --> 36:49.640
- Tom, Relax!
- Aah!

36:49.675 --> 36:55.262
- Let's go!
- Ooh, boy. That's gonna be fun.

36:55.314 --> 36:58.399
So... explain again
what you came in here for.

36:58.434 --> 37:01.519
Oh... wife thinks someone's
stealin' our trash,

37:01.571 --> 37:04.488
but I'm pretty sure
it's just the raccoons.

37:07.449 --> 37:11.693
â™ª Twinkle, twinkle little star â™ª

37:11.976 --> 37:16.929
â™ª How I wonder what you are â™ª

37:16.981 --> 37:22.068
â™ª Up above the world so high â™ª

37:22.103 --> 37:24.987
â™ª Like a diamond in the sky â™ª

37:25.023 --> 37:27.156
Excuse me... pardon me...

37:27.192 --> 37:31.244
- Pardon me.
- â™ª Twinkle, twinkle little star â™ª

37:31.279 --> 37:36.082
- Sorry, ma'am.
- â™ª How I wonder what you are â™ª

37:36.117 --> 37:40.286
Oh, wow, Emily. Is she gonna do a solo?

37:40.288 --> 37:42.955
Please don't discuss my daughter.

37:43.007 --> 37:44.290
What did you learn, Ramon?

37:44.342 --> 37:47.927
Holden got into some kind of fight
with some Argentinian kid.

37:47.962 --> 37:51.047
- Is he alive?
- â™ª How I wonder what you are â™ª

37:51.099 --> 37:54.133
- Wh... Which one?
- â™ª Up above the world so high â™ª

37:54.185 --> 37:56.886
Holden.

37:56.938 --> 38:00.056
- Yeah. Actually, they both are.
- â™ª Like a diamond in the sky â™ª

38:00.108 --> 38:02.141
- So why'd you ask me which...
- Shhh!

38:02.143 --> 38:05.945
â™ª Twinkle, twinkle little star â™ª

38:05.980 --> 38:09.031
- What else?
- â™ª How I wonder what you are â™ª

38:09.067 --> 38:10.983
Parents are talkin' to the cops.

38:14.823 --> 38:16.956
And the pastor, is he talking?

38:16.991 --> 38:19.041
Not as far as I could tell.

38:19.077 --> 38:20.293
Thank you, Ramon.

38:22.997 --> 38:25.214
Are you gonna tell Ms. Shoemacher?

38:25.250 --> 38:27.884
Not yet. There's still work to be done.

38:29.003 --> 38:31.220
Don't take this the wrong way...

38:31.256 --> 38:33.256
but do you know what you're doing?

38:33.308 --> 38:35.174
Of course I know what I'm doing.

38:35.226 --> 38:37.844
I'm in management now.

38:37.896 --> 38:43.099
â™ª A dream is a wish your heart makes â™ª

38:43.151 --> 38:48.020
