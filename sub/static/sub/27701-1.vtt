- Yeah, he didn't write that.

06:03.231 --> 06:06.162

06:06.164 --> 06:09.129
You know, obviously
a fellow songwriter.

06:09.131 --> 06:11.196
And only went crazy once, Blaze.

06:11.198 --> 06:13.962
Just once.
But he stayed there.

06:14.964 --> 06:15.964
He was shot and killed.

06:17.231 --> 06:18.296
<i>Oh.</i>

06:18.298 --> 06:20.895
Some, some punk kid in Austin.

06:20.897 --> 06:22.463
I think he lives out west now.

06:22.465 --> 06:25.829
Well, the kid was trying to
steal his dad's disability check

06:25.831 --> 06:28.996
and, uh, Blaze decided he

06:28.998 --> 06:30.429
he wasn't gonna let that happen.

06:30.431 --> 06:32.429
He tried to, he tried to do
something about it

06:32.431 --> 06:34.365
and then he took a bullet
in the gut for it.

06:36.398 --> 06:38.529

08:39.761 --> 08:41.461
I got nervous when you stopped.

08:41.462 --> 08:43.296
<i>More, more nervous.</i>

08:44.096 --> 08:45.496
Well, I'll never stop.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.227

And Good French Fries"</i>

08:51.229 --> 08:52.893
- "Let Me Ride In Your Big Cadillac."
- No, no, no, no.

08:52.895 --> 08:54.960
And we're doing
a ton of songs in A.

08:54.962 --> 08:57.527
I think we should make sure to revert
every... every third to C or E.

08:57.529 --> 09:00.959
Oh, shut up, Zee. He's just gonna
shake 'em and he's gonna roll.

09:00.961 --> 09:03.093
- <i>And my friend had to leave town for.. For 18 years.</i>
- <i>Fuck Townes.</i>

09:03.095 --> 09:04.361
I hooked Blaze up

09:04.363 --> 09:05.793
He's costin'
a shit ton of money

09:05.795 --> 09:07.260
and we only get
two hours tape.

09:07.262 --> 09:08.394
We can't have him gettin' drunk

09:08.396 --> 09:11.059
and reading off the back
of tampon packages.

09:11.061 --> 09:12.326
As funny as that is.

09:12.328 --> 09:14.059
His brother owned the rights
to all the..

09:14.061 --> 09:16.360
No, but I mean seriously, if I
ran us off the road right now

09:16.362 --> 09:19.360
and this exploded, none of these
songs would even fucking exist.

09:19.362 --> 09:20.860
<i>Just drop me off at Will's.</i>

09:20.862 --> 09:22.393
<i>"Drop me off at Will's."
Where the fuck you going?</i>

09:22.395 --> 09:24.426
<i>...is only giving Blaze
the gig because of you.</i>

09:24.428 --> 09:26.095
<i>It's like rain.</i>

09:27.195 --> 09:29.760
Rain doesn't try and fall.

09:29.762 --> 09:32.126
It just falls,
because it's rain.

09:32.128 --> 09:34.360
Okay?
So, it's the same with acting.

09:34.362 --> 09:35.959
- <i>Leave me alone!</i>
- You don't try and act...

09:35.961 --> 09:37.526
<i>I don't need your help!</i>

09:37.528 --> 09:39.393

10:04.195 --> 10:06.058
He's got a uh..

10:06.060 --> 10:09.058
...14-year-old hayseed girl
up in his room.

10:09.060 --> 10:10.826
So me and some of the guys
went up there

10:10.828 --> 10:12.528
because that didn't sound
very good.

10:14.094 --> 10:16.859
Trying to make sure everything's
on the up and up.

10:16.861 --> 10:18.428
Turns out the fucking guy
is nuts.

10:19.893 --> 10:22.060
I guess I should've known.
You know what they say.

10:23.094 --> 10:25.092
No, what do they say?

10:25.094 --> 10:27.094
Never stand in the way
of true love.

10:30.261 --> 10:31.960
I'm Sybil by the way.

10:33.495 --> 10:34.994
I'm Deputy Dawg.

10:36.027 --> 10:37.392
No, you're not.

10:37.394 --> 10:39.192
Deputy Dawg?

10:39.194 --> 10:40.494
You like Blaze better?

10:41.860 --> 10:43.459
What's your real name?

10:43.461 --> 10:45.325
It was Mike Fuller, but, uh

10:45.327 --> 10:47.994
I ditched that
when I lost 150 pounds.

10:48.927 --> 10:50.826
You lost 150 pounds?

10:50.828 --> 10:52.361
You wanna see my stretch marks?

10:53.860 --> 10:55.192
Is that your best line?

10:55.194 --> 10:57.194
<i>Ah! Nope.</i>

10:58.694 --> 11:02.361
My best line, "Picture cards
can't picture you."

11:04.327 --> 11:06.225
How'd you lose all that weight?

11:06.227 --> 11:07.227
Thorazine.

11:11.227 --> 11:14.461
Where'd you get that, uh,
that limp from?

11:15.127 --> 11:17.425
I had polio.

11:17.427 --> 11:19.192
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

11:19.194 --> 11:20.327
It's okay.

11:21.160 --> 11:23.425
I was only eight months old.

11:23.427 --> 11:25.227
I've been an oddball
ever since.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.057
I never could run or dance

11:28.059 --> 11:30.026
or play any of
the reindeer games.

11:31.261 --> 11:32.361
In high school..

11:33.859 --> 11:35.425
...I was the only Jewish person

11:35.427 --> 11:38.325
so they used to invite me into
classes for show and tell.

11:42.926 --> 11:44.059
Well..

11:45.226 --> 11:46.826
...odd ducks unite!

11:58.326 --> 12:01.360
I'm shy. I don't know why.

12:03.460 --> 12:05.957
All wild things are shy.

12:05.959 --> 12:11.224

12:32.493 --> 12:34.889
<i>At his funeral, we, uh</i>

12:34.891 --> 12:36.491
<i>we duct taped
his casket together.</i>

12:36.493 --> 12:38.823
- <i>Yeah, we sure did. Didn't we?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

12:38.825 --> 12:41.157
<i>Well, he was buried with
everything he owned.</i>

12:41.159 --> 12:43.056
Which didn't really
add up to nothing.

12:43.058 --> 12:45.823
- No. A Reagan mask, some pigs!
- But, do you know what?

12:45.825 --> 12:49.725
He, uh..
This was his guitar. Right here.

12:49.727 --> 12:50.923
<i>He gave it to you?</i>

12:50.925 --> 12:53.424
I bought it for him.
I bought it for him.

12:53.426 --> 12:55.058
- You did?
- Yeah.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.257
You see, Blaze he... he, uh..

12:58.259 --> 13:01.491
...he was really popular
at the pawn shop.

13:01.493 --> 13:03.058
Almost famous
at the pawn shop.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.390
He, he ended up
borrowing more guitars

13:06.392 --> 13:08.158
than he ever actually played.

13:09.025 --> 13:10.923
<i>After the funeral I heard</i>

13:10.925 --> 13:13.190
<i>that it might be
at this one shop</i>

13:13.192 --> 13:14.956
- <i>The guitar?</i>
- <i>This guitar.</i>

13:14.958 --> 13:17.490
<i>So I went over there
and sure enough, there it was.</i>

13:17.492 --> 13:20.390
<i>And, uh..
But, you know..</i>

13:20.392 --> 13:23.090
<i>I told the guy, I said, "Hey, man,
that's... that's my buddy's guitar."</i>

13:23.092 --> 13:26.590
And you know he gave it to me. He
actually willed it to me. Which he did!

13:26.592 --> 13:28.290
<i>But he wasn't giving away
nothing.</i>

13:28.292 --> 13:30.490
<i>He wanted 1800 bucks for it.</i>

13:30.492 --> 13:35.056
<i>So we all knew
that Blaze only had one coat</i>

13:35.058 --> 13:38.990
and I was pretty sure that that
pawn slip was gonna be in that coat.

13:38.992 --> 13:41.390
So, one night after the funeral

13:41.392 --> 13:43.956
we got thinking about it and, uh

13:43.958 --> 13:46.223
drinking about it
maybe a little bit

13:46.225 --> 13:48.290
and me and Al Minus and, uh..

13:48.292 --> 13:51.156
Crazy Kerkin you know,
some, I'm not really sure.

13:51.158 --> 13:52.755
When was this?

13:52.757 --> 13:55.022
You weren't there, but..

13:55.024 --> 13:57.123
I just pretty much decided
I was gonna go over there

13:57.125 --> 13:58.357
and I was gonna dig him up

13:58.359 --> 14:00.425
to get, to get that pawn slip.

14:02.057 --> 14:03.755
<i>And that's what I did.</i>

14:03.757 --> 14:05.955
<i>I went over there
and I dug him up</i>

14:05.957 --> 14:07.357
<i>cut through that duct tape</i>

14:07.359 --> 14:08.888
<i>opened it up</i>

14:08.890 --> 14:10.257
<i>and sure enough, there it was.</i>

14:10.259 --> 14:11.624
<i>Right there
in that breast pocket.</i>

14:14.091 --> 14:15.325
His pawn slip.

14:16.459 --> 14:18.224
I'll tell you something else
about that.

14:19.757 --> 14:21.389
When I got it open

14:21.391 --> 14:22.824
he was grinnin'.

14:24.324 --> 14:26.024
Like laughin'.

14:27.492 --> 14:28.790
So now it's my guitar.

14:32.358 --> 14:34.456
<i>Only one drink, big dog.
That's the limit.</i>

14:34.458 --> 14:36.356
<i>I don't want any shenanigans
from you tonight.</i>

14:36.358 --> 14:38.222
<i>No fights.
No belligerent bullshit.</i>

14:38.224 --> 14:39.589
- <i>No, no, he's...</i>
- <i>You got it?</i>

14:39.591 --> 14:41.822
<i>It's none for him.
He's sober. Give his to Concho.</i>

14:41.824 --> 14:42.955
<i>Damn right!</i>

14:42.957 --> 14:46.055
- <i>Blaze sober? Bullshit.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

14:46.057 --> 14:47.522
<i>He's clean as a the house too.</i>

14:47.524 --> 14:49.855
- Where's Townes?
- Oh, he's, uh, he had to make a stop.

14:49.857 --> 14:52.356
- He's right behind us. He's coming.
- Uh-huh.

14:52.358 --> 14:55.157
I'm breaking so many promise to
myself letting you play again.

14:56.258 --> 14:58.821
Don't make me regret it.

14:58.823 --> 14:59.823
Fuck!

15:01.258 --> 15:02.955
What an asshole.

15:02.957 --> 15:05.022
- Hmm.
- You good?

15:05.024 --> 15:08.055
Sneak me a Dr. Pepper
and a squirt of amber in it.

15:08.057 --> 15:10.291
Nah. You got this.
You got this.

15:13.923 --> 15:17.258
<i>Check, check, check. Alligator,
alligator, alligator, gah.</i>

15:23.823 --> 15:24.856
<i>You rollin'?</i>

15:26.223 --> 15:27.988
<i>Okay, good people.</i>

15:27.990 --> 15:31.887
<i>I've got every last dollar
in the world to me</i>

15:31.889 --> 15:34.489
<i>spinnin' 'round those
reel to reels so you know.</i>

15:34.491 --> 15:36.954
<i>So I'm gonna do my best
not to do too much</i>

15:36.956 --> 15:40.456
<i>Johnny Carsonin'
or Chatty Cathyin'</i>

15:40.458 --> 15:45.421
<i>just gonna play every song I,
I can think of I guess.</i>

15:45.423 --> 15:49.121
Will that mean we're gonna be
on the album if I shout a ton?

15:49.123 --> 15:51.054
<i>Yes, I suppose it does!</i>

15:51.056 --> 15:53.288
Hey, Jake, we're
gonna be on the album!

15:53.290 --> 15:54.821
Welcome home!

15:54.823 --> 15:56.188
<i>Fuck you!</i>

15:56.190 --> 15:58.887
Hey! When's Townes comin'?

15:58.889 --> 16:00.223
He's comin' when he's coming.

16:01.956 --> 16:04.954
Spring bird.
You know spring bird!

16:04.956 --> 16:08.221
Springers! You've got to know
some springers.

16:08.223 --> 16:11.488
Ever feel like you're not
gonna be alive much longer?

16:11.490 --> 16:15.255
<i>Ha! With the way you live,
that's not much of a premonition.</i>

16:15.257 --> 16:16.755
That's wishful thinkin'.

16:18.490 --> 16:19.954
<i>Well..</i>

16:19.956 --> 16:22.488
<i>...if I was to go up
and see the Big Spender</i>

16:22.490 --> 16:25.388
<i>That's what I call the man
upstairs, The Big Spender.</i>

16:25.390 --> 16:30.088
<i>'Cause he, or she,
is one generous being.</i>

16:30.090 --> 16:32.886
<i>You want a light? Zap!</i>

16:32.888 --> 16:34.455
<i>Here's a star on fire.</i>

16:34.457 --> 16:35.853
<i>You like flowers?</i>

16:35.855 --> 16:37.488
<i>Here's ten million
different kinds.</i>

16:37.490 --> 16:40.987
<i>You want music?
Here's Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart!</i>

16:40.989 --> 16:44.153
<i>You don't dig on the fancy
pants symphonic stuff?</i>

16:44.155 --> 16:45.488
<i>Here's Merle Haggard.</i>

16:45.490 --> 16:48.120
<i>Yeah, I suppose
if I was to check out early</i>

16:48.122 --> 16:49.621
<i>and go and meet the Big Spender</i>

16:49.623 --> 16:51.920
<i>I'd be sad I never got to meet
Merle Haggard</i>

16:51.922 --> 16:54.820
<i>never got to play
my charm song.</i>

16:54.822 --> 16:57.455
<i>So, ladies and gentleman's</i>

16:57.457 --> 17:00.387
<i>this deal tonight,
is my letter to Merle.</i>

17:00.389 --> 17:02.053
<i>Say hi to Merle, folks.</i>

17:02.055 --> 17:05.153
- Hey, Merle!
- Howdy, Merle!

17:05.155 --> 17:07.155
- Hey, Merle.
- Hey, Merle.

17:08.821 --> 17:11.354
You know, I bet
old Merle's been in love.

17:11.356 --> 17:13.220
Well, I's been in love too.

17:13.222 --> 17:16.289
This one's called "Picture Cards
Can't Picture You."

17:17.356 --> 17:18.688
<i>Ain't that right?</i>

17:20.989 --> 17:22.220
You see it's not
that primitive.

17:22.222 --> 17:23.555
It's got, you know..

17:24.289 --> 17:26.153
...running water.

17:26.155 --> 17:29.187
<i>Man, we sure do appreciate
the offer.</i>

17:29.189 --> 17:30.987
<i>You know, y'all can rent it
if you like.</i>

17:30.989 --> 17:32.089
<i>How much you want for it?</i>

17:32.821 --> 17:33.821
Nothin'.

Huh?

19:37.220 --> 19:38.520
I don't wanna be a star.

19:39.519 --> 19:41.417
I wants to be a legend.

19:43.486 --> 19:45.319
What's the,
what's the difference, deputy?

19:46.353 --> 19:48.317
Well..

19:48.319 --> 19:51.120

19:52.853 --> 19:54.820

19:55.753 --> 19:56.920
I'm amazing.

19:58.486 --> 19:59.987
Legend lasts forever.

20:01.187 --> 20:02.953
A legend stands for something.

20:04.187 --> 20:05.920
Something that matters,
you know?

20:08.486 --> 20:09.917
Well, do you think
that's possible?

20:09.919 --> 20:11.486
You... you could live forever?

20:13.353 --> 20:16.519
People can't, but a song can.

20:17.486 --> 20:18.952
It's just a matter of time.

20:43.419 --> 20:46.019
All of a sudden
I have no idea what to sing.

20:46.952 --> 20:48.752
<i>You know any Neil Young?</i>

20:49.486 --> 20:52.084
<i>When is Townes comin'?</i>

20:52.086 --> 20:54.318
<i>Why don't you play the first
song you ever wrote?</i>

20:55.385 --> 20:56.986
The first song I ever wrote?

21:00.385 --> 21:04.250
Man, I wouldn't play that song
to myself sitting in the dark.

21:04.252 --> 21:07.919
Stupid little song about living
in a tree house in the woods.

21:09.485 --> 21:12.250
I wrote that song for a..

21:12.252 --> 21:15.352
...a beautiful little Jewish gal
with kinky hair.

21:16.885 --> 21:18.919
Thought that song
would last forever.

21:34.186 --> 21:38.150
Just like every time,
I'm... preparing a scene

21:38.152 --> 21:43.018
it's like... I have all
these ideas of how I wanna do it

21:44.118 --> 21:46.316
and then..

21:46.318 --> 21:47.882
...when I actually have to do it

21:47.884 --> 21:50.051
or if there's somebody
watching me..

21:51.318 --> 21:53.452
...it's not even like stage
fright, it's just like..

21:56.818 --> 22:00.085
...the ease of it
kinda leaves my body. You know?

22:00.951 --> 22:03.215
- And..
- <i>Mm.</i>

22:03.217 --> 22:04.516
After every time, it's like

22:04.518 --> 22:06.485
it's never as good
as I know it can be.

22:09.884 --> 22:12.782
I don't know, I guess it's just,
like, confidence or something

22:12.784 --> 22:16.515
I just don't feel like I'm giving
it all the energy I actually have.

22:16.517 --> 22:19.415
I wanted to be, like, free and
not questioning what I'm doing

22:19.417 --> 22:21.382
but I'm always questioning it.

22:21.384 --> 22:23.284
Where do you think
confidence comes from?

22:25.351 --> 22:27.484
<i>I don't know.
Thinking you're the best?</i>

22:29.517 --> 22:31.184
That's not real confidence.

22:32.484 --> 22:34.384
Can I tell you
where I think it comes from?

22:35.085 --> 22:36.184
<i>Mm-hm, okay.</i>

22:37.384 --> 22:39.983
I think confidence
is a consolation prize

22:39.985 --> 22:41.484
for knowing that you're alive.

22:44.951 --> 22:45.985
I do.

22:47.817 --> 22:50.182
Some years back,
you weren't even here.

22:50.184 --> 22:52.015
And now you're here.

22:52.017 --> 22:54.118
- <i>Mm.</i>
- Couple years, you won't be here again.

22:56.050 --> 23:00.783
<i>Knowin' that you're here's...
kind of a rarity as a human being.</i>

23:04.017 --> 23:07.017
It seems too simple
but it's true I think.

23:08.351 --> 23:09.815
Next time you're on stage

23:09.817 --> 23:14.048
remember, you got a heart
beatin' in your chest..

23:14.050 --> 23:16.050
...there's lungs filling up
with air.

23:18.084 --> 23:19.850
All that stuff is really
happenin'.

23:22.950 --> 23:27.214
<i>All these little melodramas
people make up for themself</i>

23:27.216 --> 23:28.984
<i>they don't mean anything.</i>

23:30.950 --> 23:32.850
<i>I think that's the way it is.</i>

23:34.084 --> 23:36.248
You have it though.
I've seen it.

23:36.250 --> 23:37.381
<i>Yeah, as long
as you're around.</i>

23:37.383 --> 23:38.783
That's not true.

23:40.316 --> 23:42.783
You have it when you're walking
across the room.

23:44.984 --> 23:47.314
And you fill other people
with it

23:47.316 --> 23:49.316
because you remind them
that they're alive.

23:52.516 --> 23:54.481
Bet you didn't know that?

23:54.483 --> 23:55.483
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

23:57.116 --> 23:58.350
Well, now you do.

24:00.017 --> 24:01.481
Now, please discard.

24:01.483 --> 24:02.816
I'm ready, there!

24:04.216 --> 24:05.348
Can I take another one?

24:05.350 --> 24:06.448
- <i>No!</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

24:06.450 --> 24:08.015
<i>It's my turn!</i>

24:08.017 --> 24:10.483
<i>That night,
the night he died, uh..</i>

24:11.483 --> 24:13.083
...we recorded a live record..

24:13.983 --> 24:15.350
...at, uh..

24:18.183 --> 24:19.381
It was The Outhouse.

24:19.383 --> 24:21.448
Is Townes coming or not?

24:21.450 --> 24:23.847
Maintain Jennifer, he's comin'.

24:23.849 --> 24:25.046
<i>Yo!</i>

24:25.048 --> 24:27.348
I often find myself thinking on

24:27.350 --> 24:29.481
where does a song come from?

24:29.483 --> 24:31.381
A real song.
You know what I mean?

24:31.383 --> 24:33.213
He's told me not to come here.

24:33.215 --> 24:38.180
<i>'Cause the good ones, they
just sort of arrive on time.</i>

24:38.182 --> 24:40.380
<i>There we go.</i>

24:40.382 --> 24:43.280

24:51.148 --> 24:52.947

24:52.949 --> 24:55.447

24:55.449 --> 24:58.180
<i>You can't imagine the world

24:58.182 --> 25:00.280
<i>It's like babies maybe.</i>

25:00.282 --> 25:02.146
<i>Where do they come from?</i>

25:02.148 --> 25:03.515
Comes from love, right?

25:04.349 --> 25:06.814
From the galaxy deep.

25:06.816 --> 25:09.947
All them stars,
lighting up the night sky.

25:09.949 --> 25:13.280
Songs are like stars
or like babies.

25:13.282 --> 25:15.213
<i>What happens if you stop 'em?</i>

25:15.215 --> 25:17.413

it was just like his songs</i>

<i>there was two kinds of Blaze.</i>

31:29.177 --> 31:31.075
<i>Some folks met one</i>

31:31.077 --> 31:33.108
<i>some folks met the other one.</i>

was just plain wild.</i>

Lots of folks knew that one.

31:37.344 --> 31:39.908
But now the other one,
that one was different.

31:39.910 --> 31:43.740
He was big,
he was kind and gentle.

31:43.742 --> 31:47.108
But sometimes
he could get bitter.

31:47.110 --> 31:49.208
<i>I keep thinkin' about
people 20 years from now..</i>

31:49.210 --> 31:51.408

Asshole. What?

31:58.009 --> 31:59.475
Well..

31:59.477 --> 32:01.708
Listen, honey, just..

32:01.710 --> 32:04.342
Just go and order the pizzas.

32:04.344 --> 32:06.408
Well, tell him to go fuck
himself. Pizza's fine.

32:06.410 --> 32:07.408
<i>But then again..</i>

32:07.410 --> 32:09.342
What is he,
Little Lord Fauntleroy?

32:09.344 --> 32:11.508
Maybe he's just thinkin'
who the hell is this fool

32:11.510 --> 32:13.475
talking on the phone
for the whole thing?

32:13.477 --> 32:15.940
<i>You know, you'd never know
by lookin' at him.</i>

32:15.942 --> 32:19.174
But he was a spiritual,
almost righteous.

32:19.176 --> 32:22.140
I guess you could say
he took a vow of poverty

32:22.142 --> 32:24.140
and saw everything
through that lens.

32:24.142 --> 32:27.241
You know, I used to fish
the White River with my father.

32:27.243 --> 32:28.807
<i>I don't know when I'm gonna be
back. I just..</i>

32:28.809 --> 32:30.241
One spring I was

32:30.243 --> 32:32.873
fishin' with him and I said,
"Daddy, is this the same water

32:32.875 --> 32:35.040
we was ridin' on last summer?"

32:35.042 --> 32:37.374
I mean, is this water
that we're motivatin'

32:37.376 --> 32:40.807
on the same water... from before?

32:40.809 --> 32:43.341
I told you I was gonna pick some
shit up for Jim! I gotta drop it off!

32:43.343 --> 32:45.207
He just shook his head

32:45.209 --> 32:49.040
looked at me,
with some bait on his hook.

32:49.042 --> 32:52.274
'Cause I put 20 bucks in the damn
drawer is how you can order it!

32:52.276 --> 32:54.441
That's when I realized
grown folk don't know shit.

32:54.443 --> 32:56.074
<i>I can't sit here and talk
all day. I've gotta go.</i>

32:56.076 --> 32:58.207
And nobody knows nothin'.

32:58.209 --> 33:01.174
Least of all
this goofy son of a bitch.

33:01.176 --> 33:02.241
Is he talking to me?

33:02.243 --> 33:03.243
Heh, probably.

33:04.243 --> 33:06.274
Yeah! I'm talking to you!

33:06.276 --> 33:10.006
I can hear every goddamn words
you're saying on that talk bus.

33:10.008 --> 33:13.739
How many quarters do you plan
on jamming in, Igmitus?

33:13.741 --> 33:16.274
<i>Hey, man, I'm just waiting
for your shit music to stop.</i>

33:16.276 --> 33:17.872
<i>Ah, ignore this fucker, man.</i>

33:17.874 --> 33:19.174
Shit music.

33:19.176 --> 33:21.073
Honey, I might have
to call you back.

33:21.075 --> 33:22.640
- Uh-huh.
- <i>Blaze.</i>

33:22.642 --> 33:23.973
Oh, no, no, no, no.

33:23.975 --> 33:26.075
Why don't you bring your ass up
here, ZZ Top?

33:27.443 --> 33:28.806
Blaze, come on.

33:28.808 --> 33:30.073
Fucking piece of shit.

33:30.075 --> 33:31.874
<i>One time we'd been up
for like a week..</i>

33:32.874 --> 33:34.407
...writing.

33:34.409 --> 33:36.872
<i>I was finally trying
to fall asleep.</i>

33:36.874 --> 33:38.573
<i>Blaze just stumbles
into the room</i>

33:38.575 --> 33:40.741
and he's, like,
mumbling something.

33:41.941 --> 33:44.939
He, he told me
he was trying to meditate.

33:44.941 --> 33:46.106
<i>What?</i>

33:46.108 --> 33:47.806
Yeah.

33:47.808 --> 33:49.108
He, he just kept..

33:50.741 --> 33:53.505
...saying this, like, Buddhist
prayer over and over again

33:53.507 --> 33:56.073
he was just like,
staring at the wall

33:56.075 --> 33:57.173
What, like a mantra?

33:57.175 --> 33:59.039
But then all of a sudden
there was this..

33:59.041 --> 34:01.106
...explosion in the room.

34:01.108 --> 34:05.939
Like the room exploded
with this bright white light

34:05.941 --> 34:10.505
and it felt like
something, like..

34:10.507 --> 34:13.039
It was like somethin'
that hasn't made it

34:13.041 --> 34:15.440
its way into a book.

34:15.442 --> 34:19.804
<i>And from this feeling
of genuine love</i>

34:19.806 --> 34:23.242
this Buddha-like
character appeared.

34:25.507 --> 34:29.340
And he went to the door
and he opened the door

34:29.342 --> 34:33.771
and there was even a bigger
explosion of light

34:33.773 --> 34:35.773
and in walks Jesus.

34:37.074 --> 34:39.072
<i>And Jesus tells Blaze</i>

34:39.074 --> 34:41.771
that you never turn your back
on your family.

34:41.773 --> 34:43.905
Did he say it that in Aramaic?

34:43.907 --> 34:45.739
Yeah, something like that.

34:46.739 --> 34:48.005
Regardless of what you worship

34:48.007 --> 34:49.274
or how you worship..

34:51.840 --> 34:54.371
...you can't..

34:54.373 --> 34:56.306
You can't lose,
you can't strip away these

34:57.474 --> 34:59.339
these symbols
that you're raised with.

34:59.341 --> 35:01.274
They become part of you like..

35:04.074 --> 35:05.471
...like blood.

35:05.473 --> 35:08.074
<i>Hell fucking no.</i>

35:09.540 --> 35:13.272
No, no, no, no, no.
Hell fucking no.

35:13.274 --> 35:15.972
Here's what I'm saying is
Blaze didn't have to look east

35:15.974 --> 35:16.974
to see the light.

35:19.940 --> 35:21.805
The light is with us.

35:21.807 --> 35:23.205
I think the two of you
were drinking

35:23.207 --> 35:26.471
or something for a week,
and if I remember correctly

35:26.473 --> 35:28.837
<i>you had to pull a pistol on him
to get him out of your bedroom.</i>

35:28.839 --> 35:31.107
What I'm saying is
that, uh, he was, um..

35:34.940 --> 35:37.107
He was open
to that kind of experience.

35:39.772 --> 35:41.904
That doesn't mean
that I think he could handle it.

35:41.906 --> 35:44.971
Goddammit, why'd you take your hands
down to the goddamn hole in the wall.

35:44.973 --> 35:46.339
Because they won't let you in.

35:46.341 --> 35:48.804
I let you in and you come in
you asked me to come in

35:48.806 --> 35:50.770
and goddammit
I let you in and you fuck it up!

35:50.772 --> 35:52.071
- I'm real sorry about that.
- <i>I'm gonna tear your ass down..</i>

35:55.106 --> 35:57.937
Look, I care for the man.
I care for him.

35:57.939 --> 35:59.104
Six... six hundred.

35:59.106 --> 36:00.737
Let's just, let us finish this.
Now, come on.

36:00.739 --> 36:03.371
I'm just sick and fucking tired
of people getting hurt in my bar.

36:03.373 --> 36:05.171
- Don't you understand?
- Oh, come on.

36:05.173 --> 36:06.971
- It's over.
- Please?

36:06.973 --> 36:09.506
Goddammit. Son of a mother
fucking bitch.

36:11.339 --> 36:12.806
That was embarrassing.

36:14.939 --> 36:15.937
You alright?

36:15.939 --> 36:17.173
I think so.

36:18.339 --> 36:20.870
Okey-dokey, smoky-pokey.

36:20.872 --> 36:23.304
This next song
is my wedding song.

36:23.306 --> 36:27.570
If J.T.'s alright with it and
they're still not too mad at me

36:27.572 --> 36:30.503
<i>I'd love to have the Outhouse family
come up here and play some music with us.</i>

36:30.505 --> 36:34.870
Jodie, Nassie and Dave.
If y'all feel inclined.

36:34.872 --> 36:37.337
Come on up here
and play this song.

36:37.339 --> 36:40.073
<i>This song's called "Big
Cheeseburgers And Good French Fries."</i>

36:41.771 --> 36:45.370
<i>It's not like playing up a tree
house free as a squirrel.</i>

36:45.372 --> 36:48.039
<i>But looky here now, I'm just
standing here playing for Merle.</i>

36:49.139 --> 36:50.937
That rhyme to.

36:50.939 --> 36:53.503
There's a little sucker thing
going round and around.

37:03.005 --> 37:04.271
- <i>Hey!</i>
- Hey!

37:04.273 --> 37:07.070
- How you been?
- I'm doing good.

37:07.072 --> 37:09.803
Well aren't you the cutest
fucking thing I've ever seen?

37:09.805 --> 37:12.270
<i>You feel confident that they're prepared
to have a Bigfoot in their house?</i>

37:12.272 --> 37:14.370
- There's nothing to worry about.
- <i>Sam!</i>

37:14.372 --> 37:16.170
- <i>Sam, come on. They're here! She's here!</i>
- <i>Let's go, let's go.</i>

37:26.105 --> 37:28.070
Thanks for the tea,
uh, Mrs. Rosen.

37:28.072 --> 37:30.470
I wish I could
still drink coffee.

37:30.472 --> 37:32.369
Coffee does wonders
for my noodle hub

37:32.371 --> 37:35.070
but wreaks havoc
down in my spaghetti house.

37:35.072 --> 37:37.304
It's just a mess, you know?

37:40.205 --> 37:43.936
<i>Blaze, don't you think Sybil
has a nice nose?</i>

37:43.938 --> 37:47.504
Oh, Ms. Rosen, we Pentecostals
don't go in for noses.

37:52.005 --> 37:57.038
Having said that, as far as noses go,
that's one of the finest noses I knows.

38:02.404 --> 38:04.768
So you guys been married
for a long time?

38:04.770 --> 38:06.205
Oh, we've been married forever.

38:08.138 --> 38:11.336
<i>Y'all's got that
old-fashioned love.</i>

38:11.338 --> 38:13.138
That's what I want for Tsibila.

38:14.172 --> 38:18.236
Setsibila? What is Setsibila?

38:18.238 --> 38:23.202
Tsi... Tsibila. It means
a little onion in Yiddish.

38:23.204 --> 38:27.170
Little onion. So youse my little
sweet Vidalia Onion?

38:27.172 --> 38:29.504
Gonna eat you for breakfast
with my hot potato.

38:30.837 --> 38:32.302
Are you kidding me?

38:32.304 --> 38:33.471
Ugh, Mom!

38:38.404 --> 38:39.404
Sorry.

38:42.937 --> 38:45.102
Can, uh..

38:45.104 --> 38:48.737
...can we talk to one
another... honestly?

38:49.870 --> 38:51.203
Yeah. That would be nice.

38:53.403 --> 38:55.935
Sybil..

38:55.937 --> 39:01.368
...I think you brought this man
home to meet your family

39:01.370 --> 39:05.902
because... you are in love
with him

39:05.904 --> 39:09.768
<i>and you are considering
marriage and children.</i>

39:09.770 --> 39:10.870
<i>Is that right?</i>

39:13.170 --> 39:14.170
Yeah.

39:16.470 --> 39:18.401
We are a Jewish family.

39:18.403 --> 39:20.002
<i>Yes.</i>

39:20.004 --> 39:23.803
If we have grandchildren,
we would want them to be Jewish.

39:25.470 --> 39:28.803
- I got it.
- I noticed you haven't asked for Sybil's hand.

39:30.136 --> 39:31.936
Is that somethin' you were
planning on doing?

39:36.104 --> 39:39.134
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

39:39.136 --> 39:41.867
Well, now would be a great time
for that I think.

39:41.869 --> 39:42.901
- <i>Now?</i>
- <i>Dad.</i>

39:42.903 --> 39:44.034
Jeanette?

39:44.036 --> 39:45.901
Could you come on
back in here, please?

39:45.903 --> 39:47.801
No, no, Dad, Dad.

39:47.803 --> 39:50.169
Please. Let's not be ridiculous,
okay?

39:51.337 --> 39:55.200
If Blaze wants to marry me

39:55.202 --> 39:56.803
we have to talk about it first.

39:57.970 --> 40:00.435
Of course
I respect the past, but..

40:00.437 --> 40:03.400
...the past has a lot
of ugliness to it

40:03.402 --> 40:07.200
that I think we're all trying
to change in the future.

40:07.202 --> 40:09.934
I don't want to spend my life
cleaning up some man's socks

40:09.936 --> 40:11.267
and I definitely don't want
to be handed out

40:11.269 --> 40:12.936
as if I am something
that's owned.

40:28.436 --> 40:32.903
If Blaze wants my hand,
he has to ask me.

40:35.835 --> 40:40.236
And if I say yes, then,
we will ask for your blessing.

40:44.202 --> 40:46.933
And if you don't give it to us,
we'll do it anyway.

40:46.935 --> 40:52.033
But if Blaze does decide
to convert to Judaism

40:52.035 --> 40:54.967
your mother and I, and we
haven't discussed this

40:54.969 --> 40:58.334
but I'm certain we agree

40:58.336 --> 41:02.066
if he does convert, your mother
and I will cover the costs.

41:02.068 --> 41:03.302
Of course, we will.

41:05.469 --> 41:08.269
That's good to know.
That's good to know for sure.

41:09.369 --> 41:12.201
Blaze, is your faith important
to you?

41:13.268 --> 41:15.168
Is my faith important to me?

41:17.436 --> 41:19.467
I'm not dead positive
I know what you mean..

41:19.469 --> 41:22.299
Your identity as a Christian

41:22.301 --> 41:24.969
is that fundamental
to your integrity?

41:25.802 --> 41:27.967
I got ya.

41:27.969 --> 41:31.800
Mr. Rosen, Christianity didn't
do much more than kick my ass

41:31.802 --> 41:33.168
every day including Sunday.

41:34.201 --> 41:35.802
<i>It taught me to sing, but, uh...</i>

41:37.134 --> 41:40.466
the Lord giveth
and the Lord taketh away, so...

41:40.468 --> 41:44.099
No, not terribly important.
That would be a <i>nay.</i>

41:44.101 --> 41:46.802
Well, see, that's
very helpful for me to know.

41:48.201 --> 41:49.967
<i>Say, I got a question?</i>

41:49.969 --> 41:51.900
Was Zero Mostel really Jewish?

41:51.902 --> 41:53.299
From "Fiddler On The Roof?"

41:53.301 --> 41:55.199
Yeah, yeah.

41:55.201 --> 41:57.899
I believe so.

41:57.901 --> 42:00.299
In fact, I think
he was raised orthodox.

42:00.301 --> 42:01.301
Yeah.

42:02.468 --> 42:03.799
Hot dog.

42:03.801 --> 42:05.134
I love Zero Mostel.

47:26.896 --> 47:28.596
Broke his jaw in three places.

47:30.896 --> 47:33.760
This is a true story.
I was probably nine years old.

47:33.762 --> 47:35.261
And he was in the hospital
for three days

47:35.263 --> 47:37.329
and I went to visit him
on the second day.

47:37.331 --> 47:39.194
He was just... you know

47:39.196 --> 47:43.194
anxious and shaking,
and his jaw was wired shut.

47:43.196 --> 47:44.927
And he was, like, and I said,
"How you doing, Daddy?"

47:44.929 --> 47:46.328
He said "I'm doing alright,
apart from the fact

47:46.330 --> 47:47.927
"that I need a drink
and a cup of coffee

47:47.929 --> 47:49.894
"and they won't let me have
liquor inside the hospital.

47:49.896 --> 47:51.394
But they said
I could have coffee."

47:51.396 --> 47:52.827
And I'm waiting
to find out how.

47:52.829 --> 47:54.860
So the nurse came in.

47:54.862 --> 47:56.194
Nurse comes in and says,
"Mr. Fuller

47:56.196 --> 47:57.596
"I really have to apologize
to you

47:57.598 --> 48:00.328
the only way we can do this
is an enema."

48:01.463 --> 48:02.827
<i>Oh, no.</i>

48:02.829 --> 48:04.927
And he said,
"I don't care what you do

48:04.929 --> 48:07.127
I just want you to get
my coffee."

48:07.129 --> 48:09.794
So I said, "Should I leave?"
He said, "No."

48:09.796 --> 48:13.061
So she came in. She..
And I promise you, it's true..

48:13.063 --> 48:14.793
Turned him on his side.

48:14.795 --> 48:17.061
<i>And he says,
"Son, hold my hand."</i>

48:17.063 --> 48:19.061
I said, "Alright."

48:19.063 --> 48:21.127
I held his hand and he looked
at me and she said

48:21.129 --> 48:23.428
"I'm going to put in
the hose now, Mr. Fuller.

48:23.430 --> 48:24.961
Take a deep breath.
Took a deep breath."

48:24.963 --> 48:26.361
"Oh! Shit!

48:26.363 --> 48:29.027
You put the thing up
where it shouldn't be."

48:29.029 --> 48:30.228
<i>She rolled this thing in</i>

48:30.230 --> 48:32.461
they had hot coffee
up in that IV bag.

48:32.463 --> 48:33.893
- <i>Hot coffee?</i>
- Hot coffee..

48:33.895 --> 48:35.926
They just gone and pour
that thing.

48:35.928 --> 48:38.060
And she released the valve
on that thing

48:38.062 --> 48:39.093
and said,
"Take a deep breath."

48:39.095 --> 48:41.328
He said, "Oh! Shit!

48:41.330 --> 48:43.893
Oh, God almighty."

48:43.895 --> 48:46.093
And she said, "What's the matter,
Mr. Fuller? Is it too hot?"

48:46.095 --> 48:48.826
And he said,
"No! It's too sweet!"

is wrong with them?

01:09:39.477 --> 01:09:40.609
The bartender's up my ass

01:09:40.612 --> 01:09:42.009
the ladies in front of me
are up my ass.

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:44.310
- Stop it. You're drunk!
- Of course, I'm drunk.

01:09:44.312 --> 01:09:46.009
So what if I'm fucking drunk?

01:09:46.011 --> 01:09:47.243
You don't even know
why I drink!

01:09:47.245 --> 01:09:48.742
Oh why don't
you explain it to me then?

01:09:48.743 --> 01:09:50.809
<i>'Cause you wouldn't
fucking like me on Thorazine.</i>

01:09:50.810 --> 01:09:51.975
And I'll see you, boss.

01:09:51.978 --> 01:09:53.742
- Stop it. Stop it.
- I'll see you, boss!

01:09:53.743 --> 01:09:55.642
- You get away from the door.
- Come outside!

01:09:55.644 --> 01:09:57.475
I dare you to fucking
come outside.

01:09:57.477 --> 01:10:00.576
- One, two, three, come outside!
- Stop it! Stop it. Stop it!

01:10:00.578 --> 01:10:02.842
Listen to yourself.
What are you doing?

01:10:02.844 --> 01:10:05.076
- What are they doing?
- Calm down. Look at me.

01:10:05.078 --> 01:10:06.409
Stop this.

01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:08.676
<i>Why are you letting this
get to you?</i>

01:10:08.678 --> 01:10:10.442
You're better than this.

01:10:10.444 --> 01:10:12.841
You must know that.

01:10:12.843 --> 01:10:14.841
Look at me.

01:10:14.843 --> 01:10:17.808
I worked damn hard for that
guitar, you know that.

01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:19.741
Why do you think I did it?

01:10:19.743 --> 01:10:21.045
Why?

01:10:22.411 --> 01:10:24.076
You don't know why?

01:10:24.078 --> 01:10:25.908
It's because I love you.

01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:29.108
I fucking love you,
do you understand?

01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:32.275
Sybil, don't give me this
fucking greeting card horse-shit.

01:10:32.277 --> 01:10:33.777
This isn't greeting ca..

01:10:35.544 --> 01:10:37.044
There's your guitar.

01:10:44.644 --> 01:10:46.242
<i>Dear Lord</i>

01:10:46.244 --> 01:10:49.242
you say to ask for grace
and it shall be given.

01:10:49.244 --> 01:10:51.075
I ask for it. Please.

01:10:51.077 --> 01:10:53.209
I do not want to be lonely
all my life

01:10:53.211 --> 01:10:56.175
but people make me lonelier.

01:10:56.177 --> 01:10:58.841
<i>Help me with this life
that feels so</i>

01:10:58.843 --> 01:11:01.609
treacherous and disappointing.

01:11:01.611 --> 01:11:03.108
I've been reading Mr. Kafka

01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:07.108
and I can feel his problem
in getting grace.

01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:09.008
<i>I'm talkin' around the point.</i>

01:11:09.010 --> 01:11:12.408
<i>I realize you have to suffer
to learn</i>

01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:15.341
but it's hard
to want to suffer.

01:11:15.343 --> 01:11:17.641
We all walk around
puffing like peacocks

01:11:17.643 --> 01:11:20.374
as if we made our own
feathers.

01:11:20.376 --> 01:11:24.608
Cut us open, so we can see
our ego is an illusion.

01:11:24.610 --> 01:11:27.840
I would very much like to
talk to you.

01:11:27.842 --> 01:11:30.675

01:11:30.677 --> 01:11:33.042
<i>I have proved myself
a glutton.</i>

01:11:33.044 --> 01:11:35.740

01:11:35.742 --> 01:11:38.077
oatmeal cookies
and erotic thought.

01:11:40.343 --> 01:11:42.909
Okay, that's it,
take ten, everyone.

01:12:02.376 --> 01:12:06.641
The next song's called,
"If I Could Only Fly."

01:12:06.643 --> 01:12:10.240
But I was a selfish man
when I wrote this song.

01:12:10.242 --> 01:12:13.309
I wrote it for a girl,
a woman.

01:12:15.342 --> 01:12:16.874
And, uh..

01:12:16.876 --> 01:12:20.575

Zephyr Records.

01:17:49.038 --> 01:17:51.336

- Nothing

- Wait a minute. What do you mean, "Mix it?"

01:19:44.437 --> 01:19:47.535
Hey, guys, I gotta go get some sleep.
Maybe for about a week.

- Don't take it personally.
- It'll be fine.

01:19:55.303 --> 01:19:56.635
I know what it is.

01:19:56.637 --> 01:19:59.201
This is a real big deal
for us, man.

01:19:59.203 --> 01:20:00.733
<i>We've been wanting to do this
for a long while</i>

01:20:00.735 --> 01:20:02.967
<i>and it's a real good
experience.</i>

01:20:02.969 --> 01:20:05.234
<i>I couldn't help but think through
the whole recording process</i>

01:20:05.236 --> 01:20:07.401
<i>about the old fable
about the songbird for whom</i>

01:20:07.403 --> 01:20:11.369
which sang the swamp choir.
Are you familiar with that?

01:20:14.002 --> 01:20:16.201
<i>There's this beautiful
songbird</i>

01:20:16.203 --> 01:20:19.167
<i>for whom sang
in this swamp choir.</i>

01:20:19.169 --> 01:20:21.134
<i>He used to rehearse
on this little cypress tree</i>

01:20:21.136 --> 01:20:22.568
<i>and he was up there
rehearsin' one day.</i>

01:20:22.570 --> 01:20:25.234
<i>They had a big swamp recital
coming up.</i>

01:20:25.236 --> 01:20:29.568
He sang a really pretty song and this bullfrog
comes up and starts watching him singing.

01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:34.732
Songbird looked down and said, "Bullfrog,
you liked that song I'm singing?"

01:20:34.734 --> 01:20:37.267
The bullfrog looked up
and said, "Ahhh."

01:20:37.269 --> 01:20:40.033
<i>Songbird said, "Well if
you don't like that song</i>

01:20:40.035 --> 01:20:41.933
<i>I'll sing you
an even better song."</i>

01:20:41.935 --> 01:20:43.334
<i>So he sang another song
and yes indeed</i>

01:20:43.336 --> 01:20:45.367
<i>this song was twice as good
as the first one.</i>

01:20:45.369 --> 01:20:47.799
He finished up the song,
he looked down at the bullfrog

01:20:47.801 --> 01:20:52.401
and he said, "Bullfrog,
what you think about that song?"

01:20:52.403 --> 01:20:56.367
Once again the bullfrog looked
up and he said, "Ahhhh."

01:20:58.101 --> 01:21:02.699
<i>Songbird said, "Damn!
I was singing my best song."</i>

01:21:02.701 --> 01:21:06.333
<i>He took a deep breath and he sang one of the
most beautiful songs the frog had ever heard.</i>

01:21:06.335 --> 01:21:08.832
<i>In fact, it was the most beautiful
song the whole swamp had ever heard.</i>

01:21:08.834 --> 01:21:12.568
<i>It went on and on and at the end
of it this high note was held.</i>

01:21:12.570 --> 01:21:16.502
<i>The songbird stretched his
neck, his gullet up to the sky.</i>

01:21:17.734 --> 01:21:19.734
And he hit that
final crescendo and..

01:21:21.235 --> 01:21:22.667
<i>Heart gave up.</i>

01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:24.999
Songbird fell dead.

01:21:25.001 --> 01:21:26.500
And as he fell

01:21:26.502 --> 01:21:29.933
that bullfrog looked up
and said, 'Ahhh.'

01:21:29.935 --> 01:21:32.200
And swallowed the songbird.

01:21:32.202 --> 01:21:35.832
<i>The bullfrog felt pretty bad about
that, he wandered over to the river.</i>

01:21:35.834 --> 01:21:38.868
<i>And he went to see the band leader,
which was a big old fat raccoon.</i>

01:21:40.767 --> 01:21:46.200
He said, "Hey, man, I'd like to sing 'The
Revival Of The Night' if that's possible?"

01:21:46.202 --> 01:21:49.168
<i>The raccoon looked him up and
down and said, "Bullfrog..</i>

01:21:50.569 --> 01:21:53.366
<i>...can you even sing?"</i>

01:21:53.368 --> 01:21:57.700
The bullfrog said, "Nope,
but I gots it in me!"

01:22:03.833 --> 01:22:08.098
Well, that's the strangest damn
joke I ever heard.

01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:09.865
<i>Gotta say, Blaze,
we're pumped, man.</i>

01:22:09.867 --> 01:22:11.333
- Hell, yeah!
- Whoo!

01:22:11.335 --> 01:22:14.798
Looking good, looking forward to
the gig in New York.

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:17.698
<i>The first time that I ever met
Blaze was in New York City</i>

01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:19.898
<i>at the Lonestar Cafe.</i>

01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:22.367
When he was openin' up
for Kinky.

01:22:24.502 --> 01:22:28.698
See, people make a livin'
all day long writin'

01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:32.765
but really the only thing
they're sellin' is hot dogs.

Zephyr Records called ahead
and got these

01:24:10.765 --> 01:24:12.264
titty tassels
on the windows for us.

01:24:12.266 --> 01:24:16.431

01:24:26.099 --> 01:24:27.896
Well, sing us a song

01:24:27.898 --> 01:24:30.729
give us one of them
long wise intros you do.

01:24:30.731 --> 01:24:32.597
Well, it just so happens
that's my specialty.

01:24:35.166 --> 01:24:36.696
Hey, can I ask you too?

01:24:36.698 --> 01:24:40.130
Well, would you mind..
Can we do "Miss Carousel?"

<i>I'm sorry, I just..</i>

01:24:42.366 --> 01:24:45.398
I don't know what it is
about that song, but, I..

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:48.364
Every time I do those solos..

01:24:48.366 --> 01:24:51.263
...it's like a, it's like a
weird Spanish fly or something..

01:24:51.265 --> 01:24:53.463
- I don't, I mean..
- <i>Spanish fly.</i>

01:24:53.465 --> 01:24:55.731

<i>I'm sure this has happened
to you.</i>

01:25:03.998 --> 01:25:06.030
It's a kooky thing, but it
happens to me all the time.

01:25:06.032 --> 01:25:09.263
It's like a reoccurring
waking nightmare.

01:25:09.265 --> 01:25:10.829
<i>Let's say you're doing a gig.</i>

01:25:10.831 --> 01:25:12.396
<i>And everything's just goin'</i>

01:25:12.398 --> 01:25:15.496

way in the back of the hall</i>

01:25:15.498 --> 01:25:19.163
you see this dude
standing back there.

01:25:19.165 --> 01:25:21.030
He's the only guy standing up.

01:25:21.032 --> 01:25:23.596
<i>So you keep the show going,
doing some songs</i>

01:25:23.598 --> 01:25:26.163
you're talking to the people,
then all of a sudden

01:25:26.165 --> 01:25:28.096
he starts to move
a little bit closer.

01:25:28.098 --> 01:25:31.462
It's just as soon as he gets
right up to the stage, huh?

01:25:31.464 --> 01:25:34.762
So when he starts
to reach

01:25:34.764 --> 01:25:36.596
into the inside of his jacket..

01:25:36.598 --> 01:25:38.130
Oh..

01:25:38.132 --> 01:25:41.163
<i>You know, I always think of
this same thing every time.</i>

01:25:41.165 --> 01:25:45.199
Jesus, Lord,
I hope that's a gun.

01:25:47.232 --> 01:25:50.230
- And, man, it never is.
- <i>It never is.</i>

01:25:50.232 --> 01:25:52.130
It's never..

01:25:52.132 --> 01:25:54.663

Uh... uh, was there a certain reason
that you became a folk singer?

01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:41.196
What... what is it
that drives you?

01:26:41.198 --> 01:26:42.696
Well..

01:26:44.064 --> 01:26:45.761
Once I started to do a little
gigs around town

01:26:45.763 --> 01:26:47.895
and you know,
playin' a little bit

01:26:47.897 --> 01:26:49.897
I guess at one point
where I thought..

01:26:52.131 --> 01:26:54.428
"Man, I can really do this.

01:26:54.430 --> 01:26:55.930
I can really do this."

01:26:58.164 --> 01:27:00.630
But it takes blowing
everything off.

01:27:03.231 --> 01:27:04.894
You know.

01:27:04.896 --> 01:27:07.528
It takes blowing family off

01:27:07.530 --> 01:27:10.794
and... job

01:27:14.996 --> 01:27:18.827

- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:23.859
Yeah, look, you're opening up
in New York.

01:30:23.861 --> 01:30:26.425

I mean..

01:30:26.427 --> 01:30:27.592
Sorry. Blaze.

01:30:30.061 --> 01:30:31.724
You really made it, huh?

01:30:31.726 --> 01:30:34.026
Well, we just heard
in a couple weeks

01:30:34.028 --> 01:30:36.258
Willie Nelson's gonna record
"If I Could Only Fly."

01:30:36.260 --> 01:30:37.525
- <i>No.</i>
- Yeah.

01:30:37.527 --> 01:30:41.559
No. Oh, wow!

01:30:41.561 --> 01:30:43.026
Ain't it crazy?

01:30:43.028 --> 01:30:47.158
I mean, I knew it, but I didn't
really know it, you know?

01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:49.158
I'm, I'm so happy for you.

01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:51.559
Thank you.
How 'bout you?

01:30:51.561 --> 01:30:54.392
You're living in New York City doing
this Broadway thing. That's a big deal.

01:30:54.394 --> 01:30:58.025
Off.. Off Broadway.
I only got one line.

01:30:58.027 --> 01:30:59.458
One line?

01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:01.758
So what it is?

01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:02.758
Asshole.

01:31:04.726 --> 01:31:06.925
- Asshole?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:31:06.927 --> 01:31:11.258
Welcome to Broadway, Sybil
Rosen debut... "Asshole."

01:31:13.327 --> 01:31:14.325
Yeah.

01:31:14.327 --> 01:31:16.291
<i>You still writin' at all?</i>

01:31:16.293 --> 01:31:18.925
Uh, yeah. I... I've migrated
to writing plays now.

01:31:18.927 --> 01:31:19.925
- Oh yeah?
- <i>Mm-hm.</i>

01:31:19.927 --> 01:31:21.157
Alright.

01:31:21.159 --> 01:31:22.525
How 'bout you?

01:31:22.527 --> 01:31:24.958
Ooh. You know me.

01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:26.925
Have these old gypsy feets.

01:31:33.459 --> 01:31:35.960
Keep me movin' down the road.

01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:56.960
<i>Hey, I haven't heard
that one before.</i>

01:31:59.193 --> 01:32:01.990
Yeah, there's a lot
that you haven't heard.

01:32:01.992 --> 01:32:03.326
Yeah.

01:32:07.825 --> 01:32:10.057
- <i>Well, I think I, I gotta go.</i>
- Yeah?

01:32:10.059 --> 01:32:11.823
<i>But, um, I'm gonna come back
and see you play.</i>

01:32:11.825 --> 01:32:13.056
- Will you?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:32:13.058 --> 01:32:14.357
I... I got a show tonight, but..

01:32:14.359 --> 01:32:15.591
I'll try for tomorrow.

01:32:15.593 --> 01:32:17.890
Okay, well, um, I'll put you
on the guest list.

01:32:17.892 --> 01:32:18.924
<i>Okay.</i>

01:32:18.926 --> 01:32:19.956
And I'm here
for three more nights

01:32:19.958 --> 01:32:22.890
so you can come by every night.

01:32:22.892 --> 01:32:24.624
I'm happy to see you.

01:32:24.626 --> 01:32:27.424
- Me too.
- Thanks for comin'.

01:32:27.426 --> 01:32:29.123
- And good luck tonight.
- Thank you.

01:32:29.125 --> 01:32:30.956
Let me hear
that line one time.

01:32:30.958 --> 01:32:33.223
Asshole!

01:32:33.225 --> 01:32:36.089
A professional actress
right there.

01:32:36.091 --> 01:32:37.926
Asshole!

01:32:51.759 --> 01:32:54.723
Why do you suppose
she didn't come to the gig

01:32:54.725 --> 01:32:56.890
but she came to say hello?

01:32:56.892 --> 01:33:00.857
I told her I had a record coming
out w... with Willie Nelson.

01:33:00.859 --> 01:33:02.859
She said "That's great."

01:33:04.192 --> 01:33:07.325
Why the fuck would she not
come out to the gig, man?

01:33:08.125 --> 01:33:10.756
This next number is called

01:33:10.758 --> 01:33:13.822
"My Existential Journey
into Quasimodo's

01:33:13.824 --> 01:33:18.356
"Quasar Monitorial
Anti-Bilateral

01:33:18.358 --> 01:33:21.856
Underneath the Porny, uh,
Daydream."

01:33:21.858 --> 01:33:26.190
And on, on, on the side note,
it tells her to call, "Son up?"

01:33:26.192 --> 01:33:29.390
