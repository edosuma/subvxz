WEBVTT

00:01.167 --> 00:02.835
Another Yom Kippur.

00:02.835 --> 00:05.071
Do you think Bethenny
Frankel's fasting today?

00:05.071 --> 00:06.406
Uh yeah, but not because she knows

00:06.406 --> 00:07.674
what day it is.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.075
Oh, these fucking shoes.

00:09.075 --> 00:10.777
- Oh, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

00:10.777 --> 00:11.844
I never see you in a chunky heel,

00:11.844 --> 00:13.246
only a sassy flat.

00:13.246 --> 00:14.981
I'm going to my mom's break-fast later

00:14.981 --> 00:15.982
and Nicole's gonna be there

00:15.982 --> 00:17.050
and she's always dressed up.

00:17.050 --> 00:18.351
Wait, which one is Nicole again?

00:18.351 --> 00:19.919
Is that the Uber driver
that tried to sell us

00:19.919 --> 00:20.987
a friendship bracelet?

00:20.987 --> 00:22.355
No, it's another person we hate.

00:22.355 --> 00:24.324
She's that annoying psychology student

00:24.324 --> 00:25.758
who's obsessed with my mom.

00:25.758 --> 00:26.993
She looks great without makeup,

00:26.993 --> 00:28.228
she likes hiking,

00:28.228 --> 00:29.829
she has no food issues.

00:29.829 --> 00:30.730
She's basically the daughter

00:30.730 --> 00:32.165
my mom always wanted.

00:32.165 --> 00:33.800
Yeah, family is the
worst way to meet someone

00:33.800 --> 00:35.001
that you have nothing in common with.

00:35.001 --> 00:36.236
So how did you suckered into going

00:36.236 --> 00:37.470
to your brother's for Yom Kippur?

00:37.470 --> 00:39.205
You said last year, "Never again!"

00:39.205 --> 00:41.174
Which, honestly, was a little on the nose.

00:41.174 --> 00:44.777
I know, I got a call from an unknown number

00:44.777 --> 00:46.846
and I thought it was
that agent Skippy Truce,

00:46.846 --> 00:48.948
the one that likes me, but
it wasn't, it was Garry.

00:48.948 --> 00:50.083
Does your brother spell "Gary"

00:50.083 --> 00:51.084
with one R?

00:51.084 --> 00:52.919
Oh, I wish. Two Rs.

00:52.919 --> 00:53.953
The bad Garry.

00:53.953 --> 00:55.755
Of course.

00:55.755 --> 00:58.691
Hello? Yeah!

00:58.691 --> 01:00.426
Oh my God, yes! Yes, that's amazing.

01:00.426 --> 01:02.428
That's so great.

01:02.428 --> 01:03.429
Okay, thank you.

01:03.429 --> 01:04.263
Thank you! Okay, bye.

01:04.263 --> 01:05.098
I got an agent!

01:05.098 --> 01:06.466
(screaming)

01:06.466 --> 01:07.967
- That's amazing!
- Oh my God, I'm sorry!

01:07.967 --> 01:09.068
I'm screaming, I know,

01:09.068 --> 01:10.169
I'll buy your agave syrup.

01:10.169 --> 01:11.204
I can't believe it!

01:11.204 --> 01:12.338
I'm represented.

01:12.338 --> 01:13.706
- I am represented.
- Finally!

01:13.706 --> 01:15.241
I am represented! Yes!

01:15.241 --> 01:17.310
- That's amazing.
- Oh, I can't.

01:17.310 --> 01:19.078
He said I have a John C. Reilly quality.

01:19.078 --> 01:20.880
- I've always thought that.
- Yes!

01:20.880 --> 01:21.948
Do you think it's a little weird

01:21.948 --> 01:23.349
he called on Yom Kippur?

01:23.349 --> 01:24.717
No, no, no, he's not Jewish.

01:24.717 --> 01:25.852
(groans)

01:25.852 --> 01:27.854
Julie, no! Julie, no, no, no!

01:27.854 --> 01:29.188
It's fine! He's good.

01:29.188 --> 01:30.390
I'm telling you, he's legit.

01:30.390 --> 01:32.158
He knows all those guys at HBO.

01:32.158 --> 01:33.459
What more do you need?

01:33.459 --> 01:35.328
You have to pitch a series to HBO

01:35.328 --> 01:36.763
about a network that passed on

01:36.763 --> 01:38.197
all the good shows and all it was left with

01:38.197 --> 01:40.867
was "The Leftovers."

01:40.867 --> 01:42.935
Yes! Or what about a "Fraggle Rock" reboot

01:42.935 --> 01:44.737
except all the Fraggles are trans?

01:44.737 --> 01:46.272
You think that's too close to "Looking"?

01:46.272 --> 01:50.272
♪

01:53.867 --> 01:56.336
(laughter)

01:56.336 --> 01:57.437
Julie, come in.

01:57.437 --> 01:58.738
Hug Nicole.

01:58.738 --> 02:00.607
She's helping me because you were late.

02:00.607 --> 02:01.741
- Julie.
- Hey, Nicole.

02:01.741 --> 02:02.943
Oh, look at you.

02:02.943 --> 02:04.110
I'm still in my workout clothes.

02:04.110 --> 02:06.379
Oh, natural beauty.

02:06.379 --> 02:07.614
Julie, get the juice

02:07.614 --> 02:08.782
out of the fridge, please,

02:08.782 --> 02:10.317
before your father comes back

02:10.317 --> 02:11.518
with the lox.

02:11.518 --> 02:13.353
So, Julie, are you still writing?

02:13.353 --> 02:14.554
Well, I just live-blogged

02:14.554 --> 02:16.323
the Emmys last month.

02:16.323 --> 02:17.524
Twelve of the people I took

02:17.524 --> 02:19.859
improv classes with won statues

02:19.859 --> 02:21.328
and one of them hosted.

02:21.328 --> 02:22.395
Oh, that's impressive.

02:22.395 --> 02:23.563
Yeah, for them.

02:23.563 --> 02:25.465
How's psychology school?

02:25.465 --> 02:26.866
Uh, I'm already done.

02:26.866 --> 02:28.568
Yeah, she's got a graduation party

02:28.568 --> 02:30.003
on Sunday.

02:30.003 --> 02:31.671
Do you have a clean dress?

02:31.671 --> 02:32.872
Why isn't your mom hosting

02:32.872 --> 02:34.674
a graduation party for you?

02:34.674 --> 02:35.742
Because her mother

02:35.742 --> 02:37.877
just joined Scientology.

02:37.877 --> 02:39.079
Oh, it's terrible.

02:39.079 --> 02:40.547
Those people hate psychologists.

02:40.547 --> 02:41.748
You know we're

02:41.748 --> 02:43.016
the chief competitor of any cult.

02:43.016 --> 02:44.818
Wait a minute, Nicole, does this mean

02:44.818 --> 02:45.852
you know Anne Archer?

02:45.852 --> 02:46.886
Okay, just ignore her.

02:46.886 --> 02:47.887
I love her.

02:47.887 --> 02:49.723
Honey, help me with the bagels.

02:49.723 --> 02:51.858
Nicole is fasting.

02:51.858 --> 02:53.693
I can't because it's uncomfortable,

02:53.693 --> 02:55.061
and Julie can't because she's hungry

02:55.061 --> 02:56.496
all the time.

02:56.496 --> 02:58.298
Oh, is that because you work out?

02:58.298 --> 02:59.466
Come on, Nicole.

02:59.466 --> 03:01.368
No, Nicole's doing this...

03:01.368 --> 03:02.469
what is the name of that,

03:02.469 --> 03:03.803
that great new exercise thing?

03:03.803 --> 03:05.372
Oh, Bernie's Bootcamp.

03:05.372 --> 03:07.674
- Yeah, that's right.
- Every day at six a.m.

03:07.674 --> 03:10.643
Can you believe that?
"Private Benjamin" stuff.

03:10.643 --> 03:13.780
It's mud trenches, chin-ups,

03:13.780 --> 03:15.749
and there's an Army guy with a whistle.

03:15.749 --> 03:16.950
That's what you gotta do

03:16.950 --> 03:18.752
to have this body. Show that off.

03:18.752 --> 03:20.653
Look at that beautiful bootcamp body.

03:20.653 --> 03:21.788
- You.
- Stop it!

03:21.788 --> 03:23.323
Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry, I guess

03:23.323 --> 03:24.958
I just find that a little offensive.

03:24.958 --> 03:27.460
Honey, what is your problem?

03:27.460 --> 03:29.396
I don't know, just a military themed

03:29.396 --> 03:30.830
exercise class?

03:30.830 --> 03:33.433
I... think it minimizes the contributions

03:33.433 --> 03:35.635
that veterans have made to society.

03:35.635 --> 03:37.437
Well, I had no idea that
you were so concerned

03:37.437 --> 03:39.339
about protecting veterans in society.

03:39.339 --> 03:40.673
Yeah, well, I, uh,

03:40.673 --> 03:42.709
have a lot of friends who are veterans.

03:42.709 --> 03:44.744
- No you don't.
- Of course I do.

03:44.744 --> 03:46.713
There's a lot you don't
know about me, Nicole.

03:46.713 --> 03:47.814
Well, how did you meet them?

03:47.814 --> 03:48.882
Volunteering.

03:48.882 --> 03:49.983
But you don't volunteer.

03:49.983 --> 03:51.384
Tell that to my comedy career

03:51.384 --> 03:52.519
'cause it's basically just

03:52.519 --> 03:53.820
one big unpaid internship.

03:53.820 --> 03:54.921
I don't believe you.

03:54.921 --> 03:56.423
I've seen you with one friend

03:56.423 --> 03:57.724
and it's that loud gay guy

03:57.724 --> 03:58.925
that you bring around.

03:58.925 --> 04:00.894
I have lots of friends, Nicole,

04:00.894 --> 04:02.929
so many of whom are veterans.

04:02.929 --> 04:04.531
In fact, I'm gonna bring one of them

04:04.531 --> 04:06.566
to your graduation party.

04:06.566 --> 04:08.468
How do you like that? Huh?

04:08.468 --> 04:09.903
That would be amazing.

04:09.903 --> 04:11.037
I can't wait to meet him.

04:11.037 --> 04:12.906
Arthur's here!

04:12.906 --> 04:14.441
Chag sameach, Marilyn.

04:14.441 --> 04:17.377
You look like Julie's beautiful sister.

04:17.377 --> 04:19.546
You know, this looks like something

04:19.546 --> 04:21.781
that you would love to drink, Arthur.

04:21.781 --> 04:23.883
Hey Mom, just because Arthur's a WASP

04:23.883 --> 04:25.652
doesn't mean he's an alcoholic.

04:25.652 --> 04:27.587
Hm. It probably does.

04:27.587 --> 04:29.522
Arthur, you remember Nicole, right?

04:29.522 --> 04:30.757
Wanna hear something funny?

04:30.757 --> 04:32.525
Her mom knows John Travolta.

04:32.525 --> 04:33.960
- Oh really?
- Isn't that great?

04:33.960 --> 04:36.329
- John Travolta.
- Let it go!

04:36.329 --> 04:40.329
♪

04:44.804 --> 04:46.773
Billy!

04:46.773 --> 04:48.441
Come here. Chag sameach!

04:48.441 --> 04:49.509
Hey, Garry.

04:49.509 --> 04:50.710
Big hug, come in,

04:50.710 --> 04:51.978
it's freezing out there.

04:51.978 --> 04:53.480
- Take your coat off.
- Sure.

04:53.480 --> 04:56.749
Boy, sorry, I was just, uh...

04:56.749 --> 04:58.618
You got a lot of mezuzahs out there.

04:58.618 --> 04:59.986
Yeah, three of them are doorbells.

04:59.986 --> 05:01.387
Oh really?

05:01.387 --> 05:02.322
Come in, here, I got it, I got it,

05:02.322 --> 05:03.756
let go, let go, let go.

05:03.756 --> 05:04.891
Here, here.

05:04.891 --> 05:06.292
Wow, you guys keep it smelling

05:06.292 --> 05:07.694
like pot roast and boiled carrots

05:07.694 --> 05:09.729
around here all year long.

05:09.729 --> 05:10.797
Thank you very much.

05:10.797 --> 05:12.365
Rachel, look who's here.

05:12.365 --> 05:14.467
Tal, Renee, get out of the goddamn kitchen

05:14.467 --> 05:16.336
and say hello to your Uncle Billy.

05:16.336 --> 05:17.504
Hey Tal, Hey Renee.

05:17.504 --> 05:18.605
Hi, Uncle Billy.

05:18.605 --> 05:20.507
Why aren't you famous yet?

05:20.507 --> 05:22.575
Renee is going through her cunt phase.

05:22.575 --> 05:24.577
That's okay, me too. Hello, Rachel.

05:24.577 --> 05:25.845
Tal, you wanna tell Billy what your

05:25.845 --> 05:28.448
bat mitzvah party theme's gonna be?

05:28.448 --> 05:30.583
- "It gets better." 
- Are you gay?

05:30.583 --> 05:32.585
I wish. Just chubby.

05:32.585 --> 05:33.887
(chuckling)

05:33.887 --> 05:35.421
Renee, put away your cell phone

05:35.421 --> 05:36.623
or I'll take your flat iron

05:36.623 --> 05:38.424
and bury it so far up your ass,

05:38.424 --> 05:40.360
your throat will burn.

05:40.360 --> 05:41.794
It's a real threat.

05:41.794 --> 05:42.862
Yom Kippur!

05:42.862 --> 05:44.364
(awkward chuckling)

05:44.364 --> 05:45.498
Sit down.

05:45.498 --> 05:46.666
Gotta hear it all day long.

05:46.666 --> 05:47.901
I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure.

05:47.901 --> 05:50.036
They're at that age, huh?

05:50.036 --> 05:51.804
It's a real treat having
you here, you know?

05:51.804 --> 05:52.839
I don't see you enough.

05:52.839 --> 05:54.040
I've seen you, I think,

05:54.040 --> 05:55.942
twice since Dad's funeral.

05:55.942 --> 05:56.910
Mm-hm.

05:56.910 --> 05:58.011
Let me tell you something.

05:58.011 --> 05:59.679
There's only two of us left.

05:59.679 --> 06:01.381
That's it, the last people on Earth.

06:01.381 --> 06:02.582
- The last people... 
- It's up to us.

06:02.582 --> 06:04.517
The last people on Earth.

06:04.517 --> 06:05.652
And we're sitting in this house.

06:05.652 --> 06:07.654
Yes, Dad died and that's it.

06:07.654 --> 06:08.888
Uh, no, I know, I know,

06:08.888 --> 06:10.323
and I'm sorry about that.

06:10.323 --> 06:11.524
I should see you guys more

06:11.524 --> 06:12.926
but I don't want to.

06:12.926 --> 06:14.060
I'm just kidding.

06:14.060 --> 06:15.528
Rachel, Billy did a joke

06:15.528 --> 06:16.663
and he said, "I would see you more,

06:16.663 --> 06:17.764
but I don't want to."

06:17.764 --> 06:18.831
He's very funny.

06:18.831 --> 06:20.934
I was kidding. Thank you.

06:20.934 --> 06:22.302
No, but you know, you don't have to

06:22.302 --> 06:23.903
mention that every time I come over.

06:23.903 --> 06:25.805
It's not like I'm gonna forget.

06:25.805 --> 06:27.073
Dad died, you know,

06:27.073 --> 06:29.742
like it's my keys or Minnie Driver.

06:29.742 --> 06:32.045
(chuckling)

06:32.045 --> 06:34.380
Um, I have two pieces of good news

06:34.380 --> 06:36.516
that I wanted to share from my world.

06:36.516 --> 06:37.784
I can't wait to hear it.

06:37.784 --> 06:39.619
Number one: John Stamos

06:39.619 --> 06:42.322
was delightful on "The Chew" yesterday.

06:42.322 --> 06:43.823
How about it? That's great!

06:43.823 --> 06:45.425
No, no, I'm kidding.

06:45.425 --> 06:47.360
- You're joking?
- It was a joke.

06:47.360 --> 06:49.762
- Billy.

09:33.926 --> 09:35.928

09:35.928 --> 09:37.630
That's because Moshe Aronoff

09:37.630 --> 09:39.832
invented a laser you can use on skin tags

09:39.832 --> 09:41.033

gently funny comedies?

Yes, is it true that your slogan now

15:57.610 --> 15:58.811
is "It's not TV,

15:58.811 --> 16:00.813
