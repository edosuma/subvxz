00:07.919 --> 00:10.400
(CROWD CHEER)
Yes! She spoke it.

00:12.199 --> 00:15.720
Go on, Germania!
Maybe have a little hug? Yeah!

00:15.759 --> 00:18.960
I'm impressed you're able to perv
from a distance.  Cheers!

00:19.000 --> 00:22.559
I wish we could swap with Aurelius,
though, that jammy git!

00:22.600 --> 00:23.839
Ball, please.

00:23.879 --> 00:26.559
Ball boy!
Yes. Sorry. Ball man.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.879
We are a bit far from the action.
And the bogs.

00:28.920 --> 00:33.280
I've had to go in me cup.
Oh, no, Grumio!

00:33.320 --> 00:38.240
Oh-ho, dear! Help her up,
dust her down a bit maybe

00:38.280 --> 00:40.359
and a quick hug.

00:40.399 --> 00:41.560
Yow!

00:41.600 --> 00:45.399
I need another cup! Quick!

You know they're all about 13?!
OK, fine, former gymnast.

01:12.120 --> 01:15.159
Here he is, look,
that one, the mushroom head.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.200
Salve, Grumio.
All right, Landlord?

01:18.239 --> 01:20.840
This gentleman here
is looking for you.

01:20.879 --> 01:23.400
What's he done?
The little 'un? Are you sure?

01:23.439 --> 01:26.760
Whatever he's damaged, eaten
or soiled, he'll reimburse you.

01:26.799 --> 01:29.200
Oh, no, it's nothing like that!

01:29.239 --> 01:32.120
I just wanted to come
and introduce myself.

01:32.159 --> 01:33.439
I'm Justin.

01:33.479 --> 01:36.079
Your dad.

01:39.200 --> 01:43.159
Look how you've grown! Not as much
as I'd expected, but still...

01:43.200 --> 01:45.640
So, how have you been, then, son?

01:45.680 --> 01:47.640
Yeah, not too bad, thanks.

01:47.680 --> 01:50.120
Sorry. Can we back up a bit?
You're his dad?

01:50.159 --> 01:52.759
I am. Justin Corvenus. Salve.

01:52.799 --> 01:56.319
As in, the guy who left him
on a hill as a baby?

01:56.359 --> 01:59.039
Blimey, he dunt muck about,
does he? I like it!

01:59.079 --> 02:01.640
He could've died.
Steady on! I'm not a monster!

02:01.680 --> 02:04.159
It was a good hill,
right by a diddy farmhouse.

02:04.200 --> 02:08.318
My house! Where my parents brought
him up because you couldn't be bothered!

02:08.360 --> 02:11.159
I never married her
but, yeah, you're right,

02:11.199 --> 02:13.000
I screwed up. Mea culpa.

02:13.039 --> 02:14.759
I'm sorry, son.

02:14.800 --> 02:18.240
That's why I want to make it right.
I see.  Get to know you a bit.

02:18.280 --> 02:20.879
Take you to the Games,
be the dad you never had.

02:20.920 --> 02:24.575
Why now?  I only found out where
he was when they done that census.

02:24.656 --> 02:26.000
Plus, I'm in town for work.

02:26.039 --> 02:27.759
What was that about the Games?

02:27.800 --> 02:31.039
I've got tickets for the boxing
tonight. You can all come!

02:31.079 --> 02:34.120
I say we give him a chance.
Right, yeah, I wonder why.

02:34.159 --> 02:38.039
Thank you, lad. I appreciate that.
He said he's sorry!  I am so sorry.

02:38.079 --> 02:42.599
Look, I was a total knobhead.
But I'm a changed man.

02:42.639 --> 02:46.319
He's a changed man! How do you know?
Bloody 'ell, I'm confused.

02:46.360 --> 02:48.599
He's got boxing tickets!
Ringside.

02:48.639 --> 02:50.800
Ringside?
It's too little, too late.

02:50.840 --> 02:54.639
It's too much, too soon.  Of course,
son, this must be a lot to take in.

02:54.680 --> 02:57.680
If you never want to see me again,
I'd understand.

02:57.719 --> 03:01.280
But if you feel like
giving your old man another chance

03:01.319 --> 03:05.573

About time having Grumio for a slave
had its perks.

03:59.639 --> 04:02.840
What do you mean, slave?
Is Grumio your slave?

04:02.879 --> 04:05.280
Yeah. Did I not mention that?

04:05.319 --> 04:07.439
No. I thought you were just friends.

04:07.479 --> 04:09.280
Oh. Yeah. Well, we're both.

Huh...

04:13.919 --> 04:16.720
Grumio's an utterly shit slave,
if that helps.

04:16.759 --> 04:18.959
Why would that help?
Yeah. I dunno.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.199

Honestly, it's a tiny deal.

Well, seven years of training

05:30.560 --> 05:33.279
What's your style, overarm, underarm?

05:33.319 --> 05:36.120
It's more of your classic
sidearm technique, so...

Whoa-ho! You've got one hell
of a wingspan on you.

05:39.519 --> 05:42.560

it's quantity.

06:22.879 --> 06:25.240
Big moaner, more like.

06:25.279 --> 06:28.879
No. She was always busting me balls
about growing the business.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.839
I had to get out in the end,
she was driving me barmy.

06:34.120 --> 06:37.639
What's your business, then?
I'll give you a clue.

06:37.680 --> 06:41.399
You have it hot when it's cold,
cold when it's hot,

06:41.439 --> 06:45.279
and you serve it with a ladle
straight out of a pot.

06:46.680 --> 06:49.959
It's soup.  Oh, I like a bit of soup.
Well, who doesn't?

06:50.000 --> 06:53.720

Aren't discus-throwers chunky?
Whoa! She's not chunky!

07:19.680 --> 07:22.720
She's muscly, but that's because of
the bull powder.

07:22.759 --> 07:24.959
What? How do you powder a bull?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.920
I guess grate it.

07:26.959 --> 07:29.079
It's a performance enhancer.

07:29.120 --> 07:31.839
It should be banned.
I helps you go for longer.

07:31.879 --> 07:33.879
That's why you know about it!
No!

07:33.920 --> 07:36.759
You take bull powder?  No need.
To perform for longer!

07:36.800 --> 07:38.026
I can perform for ages!

07:38.106 --> 07:41.840
Finally get over the 1-minute mark?
I can hump till the cows come home!

07:41.879 --> 07:44.959
I hope the farmers don't mind,
Water boy.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.685
Yes. No, I-I don't hump cows.

07:46.764 --> 07:49.959
They were accusing me of
taking a supplement. Water man.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.680
What supplement is that?
It's called bull powder.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.639
It seems to be good for aggression.

07:54.680 --> 07:58.079
I could use a bit of that.
I think you're fine for aggression.

07:58.120 --> 08:02.160
Not for me, you nasty little
gobshite! For me new beau, Primus.

08:02.199 --> 08:05.519
I could do with him being
a tad more bullish in the bedroom!

08:05.560 --> 08:09.360
Not getting much action? The main
action does tend to be sleeping.

08:09.399 --> 08:13.160
And although Primus is very suave
and has the most charming yacht,

08:13.199 --> 08:15.959
I really need him to grab the bull
by the horns

08:16.000 --> 08:18.639

I think it's the bull powder.

08:59.086 --> 09:00.919
Two rounds without breaking sweat.

09:00.960 --> 09:04.720
About that bull powder, is it legit
or is it more cheating?

09:04.759 --> 09:07.519
No! It's just desiccated
bull's testis.

09:07.559 --> 09:10.440
Totally natural.
It's given me so much more energy.

09:10.480 --> 09:14.039
Maybe we should go for a run.
Or I've got another idea...

09:14.080 --> 09:17.369
I can't have sex, Stylax.
I can't even fool around.

09:17.448 --> 09:19.600
I'm on lockdown

09:19.639 --> 09:22.440
Really? Because I'm happy
to do the donkey work.

09:22.480 --> 09:24.519
Listen, I'll make it up to you, OK?

09:24.559 --> 09:27.879
As soon as I'm knocked out,
I'll be partying. Hard.

09:27.919 --> 09:31.159
OK! And you've done two rounds
out of...? Eight!

09:31.200 --> 09:35.039
Don't sweat it, hun, I doubt
I'll make it past three. Four max.

09:35.080 --> 09:39.679
Come on, you. Race you to the arch.

09:41.360 --> 09:43.919
Get in! Get in!

09:43.960 --> 09:46.320
(GRUNTS)

09:46.360 --> 09:49.679
So, what am I doing with the garlic?
You're frying it.

09:49.720 --> 09:53.120
Can you do that or shall I get
the slave to do it for you?

09:55.200 --> 09:58.120
You realise I do everything
around here, don't you?

09:58.159 --> 10:00.792
Having Grumio's not
like having a slave.

10:00.871 --> 10:03.759
It's more like having
leprosy. I know. It's OK.

10:03.799 --> 10:06.320
I'm only winding you up.

10:07.480 --> 10:10.399
What's that?

10:10.440 --> 10:12.000
"Gregory"?
Uh-huh.

10:12.039 --> 10:13.240
So?

10:13.279 --> 10:17.600
So, is that anything to do with good
looking French cheesemonger Gregory?

10:17.639 --> 10:20.879
Uh, yeah. We used to go out.
Oh!

10:20.919 --> 10:23.159
Right. I thought he was a friend.
He is.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.960
He's an ex and a friend.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.519
It must've been pretty serious,
because I've got exes and friends

10:29.559 --> 10:32.000
and none of their names
are written on my body!

10:32.039 --> 10:36.320
Tattoos are very common
in Gallic culture. Don't be a baby.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.720
It's a tiny deal, OK?

10:42.879 --> 10:45.360
I just wish I could stay longer,
son,

10:45.399 --> 10:48.639
do all that dad shit
I never got chance to do before,

10:48.679 --> 10:53.159
take you hunting, read you stories,
change your nappies.

10:53.200 --> 10:57.039
I realise you're a bit past that
now.  I still have the odd accident.

10:57.080 --> 10:58.879
Don't we all?!

11:00.159 --> 11:04.279
But I've got to keep moving. Once this
meeting's over, I'm back on the road,

11:04.320 --> 11:07.879
sitting on me arse,
stuffing me face with junk food.

11:07.919 --> 11:10.039
Sounds wicked.

11:10.080 --> 11:13.399
Eh, why don't you come with us,
as part of Justin's Soups?

11:13.440 --> 11:17.080
I can teach you the business,
make you the heir to the empire!

11:17.120 --> 11:19.080
Are you serious?
Deadly.

11:19.120 --> 11:22.840
I'll change the company name to,
erm, Justin & Son Soups.

11:22.879 --> 11:24.120
No. No.

11:24.159 --> 11:28.039
Justin and Grumio's Soups.
I'd have to change the logos but...

11:28.080 --> 11:33.240
Or I could change my name to Justin.
Then we could keep the logos the same.

11:33.279 --> 11:38.240
Yes! Justin and Justin,
the Soup Boys, out on the road!

11:38.279 --> 11:40.559
What do you reckon?

11:40.600 --> 11:43.919
Give me a side parting an' all.

11:47.679 --> 11:51.360
Morning. What's for brekko, then?

11:51.399 --> 11:55.039
We should be asking you that.
Soz, yeah. Late night with me dad.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.399
Listen, right, I've had an idea -

11:57.440 --> 11:59.039
cow and radish.

11:59.080 --> 12:02.159
OK. Just trying to work out
what part of that is an idea.

12:02.200 --> 12:05.519
I'm coming up with new soups.
Me dad says I've got great taste.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.759
Your dad's wrong.
You eat your earwax.

12:07.799 --> 12:11.559
I've got more.
Bean and bird, salmon and gammon,

12:11.600 --> 12:12.720
bread and orange.

12:12.759 --> 12:15.711
You're saying the first things
that come into your head.

12:15.792 --> 12:16.879
Dad says I'm a natural.

12:16.919 --> 12:20.039
He's taking me on the road
to help him run his business.

12:20.080 --> 12:23.991
Boom! Do you not think you might
be getting a bit carried away?

12:24.072 --> 12:25.600
He did leave you on a hill.

12:25.639 --> 12:27.291
Stop slagging off me dad.

12:27.370 --> 12:31.399
- I'm looking out for you, Grumio.
- Justin! Me name's Justin now!

12:31.440 --> 12:34.480
Or Justin Junior.

12:35.840 --> 12:38.600
Or possibly sometimes JJ.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.852
It's on her wrist. He's
written his name on her.

12:43.932 --> 12:46.000
Like she's his gym kit!
Or his pants!

12:46.039 --> 12:48.320
What's his name?
Why does that matter?

12:48.360 --> 12:51.879
It could be little, like Leo,
or long like Agathangelos.

12:51.919 --> 12:54.759
It's medium, like Gregory.
See, it could be worse!

12:54.799 --> 12:57.759
Ciao for now, boys,
I won't be in this afternoon.

12:57.799 --> 13:02.480
Oh, Flavia, apparently bull powder
can be dangerous for non-athletes.

13:02.519 --> 13:04.370
I know. Primus had a heart attack.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.879
Oh, my Jove, is he all right?
Not great. I'm off to his funeral.

13:07.919 --> 13:09.408
Was that bedroom-related?

13:09.488 --> 13:12.879
Bedroom, kitchen, cellar, garden.
It was quite an evening.

13:12.919 --> 13:16.440
The bull powder really got him going
before stopping him dead!

13:16.480 --> 13:21.080
Still, saves me having to dump him!
(CHUCKLES)

13:24.840 --> 13:26.240
Veal and...

13:26.279 --> 13:29.039
Sorry, the ink's gone sweaty.
I think it's eel.

13:29.080 --> 13:32.519
Veal and eel! Yeah, I like it.

13:32.559 --> 13:34.399
Then we've got pork and bogey...

13:34.440 --> 13:36.759
Oh, no.
Wait, that is an actual bogey.

13:36.799 --> 13:41.559
These are all great, son. Not the pork
and bogey one, but the others...!

13:41.600 --> 13:44.200
Shall I pitch them in the meeting,
then?  Oh...

13:44.240 --> 13:47.720
No. I reckon I'll do this one
on me own. It is a biggie.  Oh.

13:47.759 --> 13:50.168
So, when you gonna
learn me the business,

13:50.249 --> 13:52.600
then, when we're
on the road?  Maybe, yeah.

13:52.639 --> 13:55.279
Although I do like to drive
in silence.

13:55.320 --> 13:57.519
Or in our hotel room, then.

13:57.559 --> 13:59.600
Yeah! Exactly.

13:59.639 --> 14:02.600
Er, we won't be sharing a room,
though.

14:02.639 --> 14:05.279
I mean, that's not gonna work!
Why not?

14:05.320 --> 14:08.679
In case I meet someone on the road.

14:08.720 --> 14:11.960
You won't need to,
cos I'll be with you the whole time!

14:12.000 --> 14:13.600
Aww!

14:13.639 --> 14:19.240
Can you read me a story, Dad? Er, I've
got nothing on me, Justin Jr, clearly.

14:19.279 --> 14:22.320
Maybe when we go hunting, then.
We can still go hunting?

14:22.360 --> 14:24.639
Yeah! Yes. Yeah, course we can.

14:24.679 --> 14:26.360
When?  Er...
Today?

14:26.399 --> 14:28.799
Oh... Yeah. Fine.

14:28.840 --> 14:31.799
Meet me under the arch
on Palatine Hill about three.

14:31.840 --> 14:33.320
Mm. Nice!

14:33.360 --> 14:37.679
I'll think of some more soup ideas
for you, too. Vinegar and egg.

14:37.720 --> 14:39.399
Lobster and lobster.

14:39.440 --> 14:41.000
Blood and chutney.

What the hell are you doing?
I'm cheering her on.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.600
Well, stop it! I don't get any action
until she's knocked out.

15:03.639 --> 15:06.399

Did not realise that.

Yeah, but we've cooled it off
for now.  Mm.

Wow! With your little stick?

19:17.039 --> 19:20.400
Yeah. I just grabbed him
by the 'orns and stuck it in.

19:20.440 --> 19:23.640
Right. Not sure bears have horns.
This one did.

a really good time.
