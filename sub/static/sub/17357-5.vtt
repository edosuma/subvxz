Woman: Previously on Deadbeat...

00:08.349 --> 00:10.455
Ghost stick around when they
have unfinished business.

00:10.465 --> 00:13.886
Finishing unfinished
business is my business.

00:13.896 --> 00:15.288
Camomile: What else do
we know about this guy?

00:15.289 --> 00:17.949
It seems he's fashioned
himself a little ghost hut

00:17.956 --> 00:20.809
- out of a newsstand.
- What are you scheming?

00:20.817 --> 00:22.503
- Camomile White.
- Hi.

00:22.504 --> 00:24.147
Would you like to go out sometime?

00:24.152 --> 00:25.596
That's not what I thought you'd say.

00:25.598 --> 00:27.896
- Do you want to take my number?
- Oh.

00:27.901 --> 00:33.126
- Call me when you want to...
- (Grunting)

00:33.136 --> 00:35.521
play. Call me.

01:07.664 --> 01:09.589
(Mysterious theme playing)

01:11.842 --> 01:13.688
I don't get why she hasn't called me back.

01:13.698 --> 01:16.685
I mean, I have certainly left
her enough voice messages

01:16.686 --> 01:18.234
to let her know I'm still interested.

01:18.244 --> 01:20.219
Look, why don't you just
break into her apartment

01:20.229 --> 01:22.283
and wear all her clothes and wait for her?

01:22.293 --> 01:23.871
I do know where she lives.

01:23.881 --> 01:25.132
Look, just play it cool, you know?

01:25.142 --> 01:26.662
People love what they can't have.

01:26.670 --> 01:30.610
And that's the principle. It's
the same business with pa-chank.

01:30.611 --> 01:32.199
You can never try to impress a femmie.

01:32.208 --> 01:34.114
That's why I let them impress me.

01:34.121 --> 01:36.933
- Yeah, that makes sense.
- Excuse me. Is this your place?

01:36.943 --> 01:39.578
I'm here 'cause I heard
you deal with ghosts.

01:39.583 --> 01:41.647
- Yeah, he's the best.
- I am the best.

01:41.657 --> 01:44.168
I work over at the United
States of Apparel on Lex.

01:44.178 --> 01:46.749
It's that clothing store. I
think it might be haunted.

01:46.759 --> 01:50.858
Uh, I'm sorry. Are you asking me questions?

01:50.868 --> 01:54.143
- Or...
- No, that's the way she talks.

01:54.153 --> 01:55.999
- Oh.
- Look, look. Sorry about him.

01:56.009 --> 01:57.458
- I got to get back to my shift,

01:57.468 --> 01:59.383
but can you take the case or not?

01:59.393 --> 02:01.071
I can't pay you money, but
I can probably give you

02:01.081 --> 02:02.996
some merchandise left
over from last season.

02:03.006 --> 02:05.357
Listen, I can't afford to do any more cases

02:05.358 --> 02:06.783
where I don't get paid in money for.

02:06.788 --> 02:09.666
You know what... I know somebody
that can flip that merch into cash.

02:09.675 --> 02:12.981
- Oh, all right.
- So can you come with me right now?

02:12.991 --> 02:14.470
- We on it, we on it.
- We on it.

02:14.480 --> 02:16.365
We on it, baby. It's a ghost.

02:16.375 --> 02:18.986
Hey, you know what? I think
you should let me come with you

02:18.995 --> 02:21.705
on this case. Could be like a ride along.

02:21.715 --> 02:23.988
Ah, I see what's going on here, man.

02:23.998 --> 02:25.774
You are head over heels for this girl.

02:25.784 --> 02:28.533
No, no. That's not what it
is. I want to see, actually,

02:28.543 --> 02:30.816
what my best friend does
on this job, you know?

02:30.826 --> 02:34.201
- Oh, do you?
- Yes, yes.

02:34.211 --> 02:36.493
Okay, let's go.

02:36.503 --> 02:38.488
(Mysterious theme playing)

02:47.411 --> 02:50.279
Oh, my God. I hate myself.

02:50.289 --> 02:53.436
Oh, come on, man. These hoes are
pros, man, these skinny girls.

02:53.445 --> 02:55.490
Actually, all these poses are of girls

02:55.500 --> 02:57.177
that are employees or former employees.

02:57.187 --> 02:59.172
Word?

02:59.182 --> 03:02.517
Oh, my God. So I'm guessing this is you.

03:02.527 --> 03:06.398
Ha, ha, ha. It's from the spring 2014 line.

03:06.408 --> 03:08.690
Your ass is from the spring 2014 line?

03:08.700 --> 03:12.670
- The sock, silly.
- Oh. I'll take that too.

03:14.467 --> 03:15.956
(Mysterious theme playing)

03:29.057 --> 03:31.975
Hey there, doll face. I see you.

03:33.970 --> 03:35.975
Woman: What a weirdo.

03:35.985 --> 03:38.208
What?

03:39.339 --> 03:42.902
Okay. Let's get you in here.

03:42.912 --> 03:45.364
I'm sorry. Sorry.

03:45.374 --> 03:47.448
Yeah.

03:47.458 --> 03:50.366
Thought maybe you would
like a little privacy.

03:50.376 --> 03:54.445
Oh, pardon me, where are my mannerisms?

03:54.455 --> 03:57.294
My name is Kevin, and I help ghosts.

03:57.304 --> 04:00.152
Even ghosts like you who
have taken up root in,

04:00.162 --> 04:01.710
let's be honest,

04:01.720 --> 04:04.757
in extraordinarily
realistic vessels like this.

04:04.767 --> 04:06.911
You know like, 90 percent human basically.

04:06.921 --> 04:08.608
It's almost as if no one could fault a guy

04:08.618 --> 04:10.762
for getting confused and...

04:10.772 --> 04:13.908
inserting myself into you.

04:13.918 --> 04:16.171
I just so happen I have
one of these pre-lubes,

04:16.180 --> 04:17.988
so you don't have to do any of the work.

04:17.998 --> 04:21.045
Lot of diseases out there.

04:21.053 --> 04:23.923
I just...

04:23.933 --> 04:25.848
Oh! Ah! Ha, ha, ha!

04:25.858 --> 04:27.833
Dude, what is your damage?

04:27.843 --> 04:30.027
I had to get you out of there
somehow. Look, it worked.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.180
Wait, how... how can you hear me?

04:32.190 --> 04:36.399
Like I said to your mannequin, I'm Kevin.

04:36.409 --> 04:38.513
I help ghosts, all right?
So let's rap, let's jive.

04:38.523 --> 04:40.567
Tell what you're doing
here. What's your name?

04:40.577 --> 04:43.753
- Why are you haunting this store?
- My name is Alice.

04:43.763 --> 04:45.480
I was just a girl from Bumblefork, Iowa.

04:45.490 --> 04:47.068
I moved to New York City

04:47.078 --> 04:50.026
with big eyes and a small
waist and a medium-sized dream.

04:50.036 --> 04:51.842
I wanted to be a model.

04:51.852 --> 04:55.564
One day, the CEO of United
States of Apparel, Reed Kelly,

04:55.574 --> 04:56.924
came in while I was working.

04:56.934 --> 04:58.839
We started talking about tube tops,

04:58.849 --> 05:00.963
and he must've been really
interested in what I had to say

05:00.973 --> 05:02.492
because he asked me out.

05:02.502 --> 05:04.745
I went out with him, just the two of us.

05:04.755 --> 05:06.402
And that's when it happened.

05:06.412 --> 05:10.412
What? Oh. Oh, my God, did
he... did he murder you?

05:10.422 --> 05:13.935
Worse. He kept on telling
me how beautiful I was

05:13.945 --> 05:15.791
and how hot I was making him, and...

05:15.801 --> 05:19.503
Next thing I knew, I was
stripped down to my underwear

05:19.513 --> 05:20.794
and he was taking pictures of me.

05:20.804 --> 05:23.513
Oh, my God, he exploitered you.

05:23.523 --> 05:26.431
Just like he exploitered
every other girl in here.

05:26.441 --> 05:27.662
No.

05:27.672 --> 05:30.481
Those other girls, they got lucky.

05:30.491 --> 05:33.359
What do you mean? What did he do?

05:33.369 --> 05:35.314
He, uh...

05:35.324 --> 05:37.279
He...

05:37.289 --> 05:39.433
He didn't use my pictures.

05:39.443 --> 05:41.587
He didn't...

05:41.597 --> 05:43.175
Uh, ex-squeeze me?

05:43.185 --> 05:45.031
Not on billboards, not in the store,

05:45.041 --> 05:48.653
not even in those pop-up ads
during words with friends.

05:52.306 --> 05:55.095
Calm down, calm down. I'm
here to help, remember?

05:56.087 --> 05:57.397
- You are?
- Yes.

05:57.407 --> 05:58.995
It sounds like a piece of cake.

05:59.005 --> 06:02.072
All I gotta do is meet with this CDO guy

06:02.082 --> 06:05.099
- and make him use these photos, right?
- Yeah.

06:05.109 --> 06:08.911
- But there's just one problem.
- What?

06:08.921 --> 06:10.568
Reed Kelly suffers from a debilitating case

06:10.578 --> 06:13.089
of cacomorphobia.

06:13.099 --> 06:15.005
Oh, no. Oh, boy.

06:15.015 --> 06:17.903
Is that the irrational fear of cocoa puffs?

06:19.064 --> 06:21.079
Uh, no.

06:21.089 --> 06:23.034
It's the fear of fat people.

06:23.044 --> 06:26.151
Fear of fat...

06:26.160 --> 06:28.155
Sorry.

06:36.046 --> 06:38.319
Cacomor...? It sounds like cockomorphobia.

06:38.329 --> 06:40.641
So it's not a fear of cocoa puffs,

06:40.651 --> 06:43.093
it's a fear of those who
consume them irresponsibly.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.753
Exactly. I have no idea how I
get a meeting with this guy.

06:45.763 --> 06:48.234
Look at me. How am I gonna
pass myself off as thin?

06:48.244 --> 06:50.288
I don't know, lose weight?

06:50.298 --> 06:52.283
Oh, get serious, Roofie. Come on.

06:52.293 --> 06:55.261
What about you? You're skinny.
You can talk to the CDO.

06:55.271 --> 06:58.715
Hey man, I would, but I
got priors with N'Cole.

06:58.725 --> 06:59.946
With N'Cole?

07:01.712 --> 07:03.618
I knew it. I knew it, man.

07:03.628 --> 07:06.675
I mean, do you even know a guy who
can flip women's clothing into cash?

07:06.685 --> 07:09.156
Or am I just gonna have to wear
this stuff, like a fancy boy?

07:09.166 --> 07:13.136
I'm sorry, Pac, but, man,
this bitch could be the one.

07:14.079 --> 07:15.885
You're really into this chick, huh?

07:15.895 --> 07:18.773
Almost. But she's all stressed
about this ghost thing.

07:18.783 --> 07:22.892
Actually, you solving this
could be major points for me.

07:22.902 --> 07:26.664
All right, all right, I will. I'll do it.

07:26.674 --> 07:29.086
I still have no idea how am
I gonna get into his office.

07:29.096 --> 07:32.738
I don't know, just, you know,
like, wear something slimming.

07:32.748 --> 07:34.723
Wear something slimming?

07:34.733 --> 07:36.549
Something that makes you look thinner.

07:36.559 --> 07:39.606
You know what? I think
I have just the thing.

07:45.591 --> 07:47.586
(Upbeat theme playing)

08:09.441 --> 08:10.890
(Clears throat)

08:10.900 --> 08:13.014
Can I help you?

08:14.443 --> 08:15.823
(Speaks French)

08:15.833 --> 08:17.153
I am Pierre L'Croissant,

08:17.163 --> 08:19.108
the very famous French fashion mongrel.

08:19.118 --> 08:20.468
Perhaps you have heard of me.

08:20.478 --> 08:23.783
I am arrived to see Reed Kelly.

08:23.793 --> 08:25.907
I'm sorry, if you don't
have an appointment,

08:25.917 --> 08:28.229
I can't let you in.

08:28.239 --> 08:30.056
Do you really think
that Pierre L'Croissant,

08:30.066 --> 08:31.445
the inventor of the cargo short,

08:31.455 --> 08:33.966
is accustomed to waiting
for an appointment?

08:33.976 --> 08:36.914
Do you really think you're
passing for three skinny people

08:36.924 --> 08:39.673
and not just one fat guy
with two fake black heads

08:39.683 --> 08:41.301
mounted on his shoulders?

08:43.325 --> 08:45.301
Touché.

08:45.310 --> 08:48.357
Okay, listen, I just need five
minutes of Mr. Kelly's time.

08:48.367 --> 08:51.672
It's about an employee who was
terrorizing one of his stores.

08:51.682 --> 08:54.223
It's a... it's a pretty young thing

08:54.233 --> 08:57.578
he had may have an indiscretion with.

08:57.588 --> 08:59.841
I think he'll wanna hear about it.

09:02.560 --> 09:05.766
Mr. Kelly, there's a
Pierre L'Croissant here

09:05.776 --> 09:07.989
to see you, says it's urgent.

09:07.999 --> 09:10.481
Quite fat, yeah.

09:11.979 --> 09:13.835
Okay.

09:16.654 --> 09:19.006
Thank you.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.899
(Door buzzes open) Kelly: Mr. croissant.

09:23.909 --> 09:27.056
Mr. croissant, please, please come in.

09:27.065 --> 09:29.576
As a result of my involuntary repulsion

09:29.586 --> 09:31.492
towards people of considerable girth,

09:31.502 --> 09:34.549
I will have to conduct this
meeting facing away from you.

09:34.559 --> 09:37.009
I completely understand, good
sir. The reason I'm here...

09:37.010 --> 09:40.355
- Oh. Stop, stop, stop.
- What?

09:40.365 --> 09:41.943
- (Bleep) me.
- What?

09:41.953 --> 09:44.464
Even your voice sounds
fat. Look, do me a favor.

09:44.474 --> 09:48.444
Croissant, please there is
a helium tank to your right.

09:49.318 --> 09:51.362
- Yeah, the pink one?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:51.372 --> 09:54.240
I always keep it on deck.
I have an obese FedEx guy.

09:54.250 --> 09:56.603
- Do me a favor, just give it a little toot.
- A little suck on this?

09:56.612 --> 09:58.320
Yeah, stop talking. Give it a little...

09:58.330 --> 09:59.729
Okay.

10:01.218 --> 10:04.136
(High voice): Ah. Okay, is that better?

10:06.121 --> 10:07.371
Much.

10:07.381 --> 10:10.091
- Okay.
- Thank you. I like that a lot.

10:10.101 --> 10:11.490
Anyway, you were saying?

10:11.500 --> 10:13.445
Yes, I was saying that...

10:13.455 --> 10:16.224
I'm afraid one of your
stores is being haunted

10:16.234 --> 10:18.745
by a former employee named Alice N.

10:18.755 --> 10:20.701
She's a little peeved

10:20.711 --> 10:23.321
because you took some
scandally type photos of her

10:23.331 --> 10:25.981
and then didn't use any of them.

10:25.991 --> 10:27.172
(Sighs)

10:27.182 --> 10:30.020
Son of a bitch.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.541
I knew this would come back
to bite me right in the dick.

10:32.551 --> 10:34.268
Yeah. I know the girl you're talking about.

10:34.278 --> 10:35.698
Yes, yes.

10:35.707 --> 10:37.911
Got me. Okay.

10:37.921 --> 10:40.372
And there's a reason,
a perfectly good reason

10:40.382 --> 10:42.060
that I did nothing with those photos.

10:42.069 --> 10:45.017
You see, I found out that
Allison was in fact...

10:46.149 --> 10:47.330
My daughter.

10:47.340 --> 10:50.416
- What?
- Yeah.

10:50.426 --> 10:53.265
From a one-night stand, years ago.

10:53.275 --> 10:55.984
- In middle school.
- (Normal voice): Oh, my God.

10:55.994 --> 10:59.170
- Whoa, helium, helium. Helium.
- Yeah, I got it right here.

10:59.180 --> 11:01.225
(Gags)

11:01.235 --> 11:03.478
(High voice): Okay,
we're back to square one.

11:03.488 --> 11:06.833
Oh, Jesus. Okay. Anyway, I'm sorry,

11:06.843 --> 11:09.681
but there's no way I
could exploit my daughter.

11:09.691 --> 11:12.897
I mean, what kind of a
monster do you think I am?

11:12.907 --> 11:16.113
Well, I will certainly tell Alice N.

11:16.123 --> 11:17.770
She's gonna be a little disappointed.

11:17.780 --> 11:19.368
Also, probably a little disturbed.

11:19.378 --> 11:21.720
Okay, I'm sorry. Hold on.

11:21.730 --> 11:23.209
Why do you keep saying her name that way?

11:23.219 --> 11:26.891
What? Oh, Alice N?
Because I know two Alices,

11:26.901 --> 11:29.045
and this is how I keep
them different in my head.

11:29.055 --> 11:33.293
This one is called Alice N,
like new Alice, Alice New.

11:33.303 --> 11:36.042
- The other is Alice O for old...
- Okay, hold on.

11:36.052 --> 11:37.700
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

11:37.710 --> 11:39.853
I got it. Ha, ha, ha.

11:39.863 --> 11:42.771
Wait a minute. Holy shit.

11:42.781 --> 11:46.652
Wait a second. I thought
you were saying Allison.

11:46.662 --> 11:48.776
- No. Alice...
- Yes. Can you understand

11:48.786 --> 11:50.533
why I thought you were saying Allison?

11:50.543 --> 11:52.587
- Because when you say Alice N,
- Alice N, yeah.

11:52.597 --> 11:53.818
It sounds like Allison.

11:53.828 --> 11:56.796
- Oh, I guess so.
- Okay. This Alice girl.

11:56.806 --> 11:59.624
This Alice "N", okay?

11:59.634 --> 12:02.800
I don't... I don't know
who... that's not my daughter.

12:02.810 --> 12:04.994
No. Uh-uh. No, no, no.

12:05.004 --> 12:08.339
She's probably just some
girl from Bumble ( ), Iowa.

12:08.348 --> 12:11.654
- Uh, it's Bumblefork.
- Whatever. Don't correct me.

12:11.663 --> 12:14.740
Anyway, I will totally
exploit this Alice girl.

12:14.750 --> 12:16.666
Fantastic. Yeah.

12:16.676 --> 12:20.646
That is great news. Uh, but
what about your daughter?

12:20.656 --> 12:22.700
The other Allison?

12:22.710 --> 12:24.596
Let's just forget about her.

12:25.757 --> 12:27.881
(Mysterious theme playing)

12:29.410 --> 12:31.881
- These are the photos from Reed.
- Alice: Fat.

12:31.891 --> 12:34.372
Fat. F.U.P.A.

12:34.382 --> 12:35.861
Fat.

12:35.871 --> 12:37.518
Bloated earlobe.

12:37.528 --> 12:39.474
Melon groove.

12:39.484 --> 12:42.233
Look at these rolls of fat on my side here.

12:42.243 --> 12:43.553
Those are ribs.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.151
Are these really all of them?

12:45.161 --> 12:47.503
I think you look
super-duper skinny in these.

12:47.513 --> 12:49.061
Well, compared to you, maybe.

12:49.071 --> 12:51.681
You're like one big human carbohydrate.

12:51.691 --> 12:55.661
Hey. I happen to love my
body for what it is, okay?

12:55.671 --> 12:57.557
- Well, aren't you lucky?
- Yes.

12:59.086 --> 13:01.229
What the hell?

13:01.239 --> 13:03.482
Roofie? Are those kitty
cats in your underwear?

13:03.492 --> 13:06.569
Yo, what the hell? I thought you
was dealing with the haunting.

13:06.579 --> 13:10.380
I tried, I tried. There is
just no pleasing this ghost.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.405
She has got major body issues.

13:12.415 --> 13:14.390
She doesn't even have a body anymore.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.187
Look, please don't let me down, man.

13:16.197 --> 13:18.410
N'Cole got some melon grooves
a dude could get lost in.

13:18.420 --> 13:20.690
I wanna help you with that, but I can't.

13:20.691 --> 13:24.841
- Hey, Please finish this, all right?
- Yeah, okay.

13:24.851 --> 13:25.892
Uhh.

13:25.893 --> 13:27.988
(Sobbing)

13:29.010 --> 13:30.657
Hey, hey, hey.

13:30.667 --> 13:33.347
Hey, girl.

13:33.357 --> 13:36.364
Listen, I was thinking we
could take those pictures

13:36.374 --> 13:39.291
and photoshop them to make you
look as skinny as you want.

13:39.292 --> 13:41.168
No, that would be cheating.

13:41.178 --> 13:43.163
I mean, those photos are supposed to show

13:43.173 --> 13:45.813
my hard w ork and dedication to...

13:45.823 --> 13:47.739
Oh, my God. I'm such an idiot.

13:47.748 --> 13:49.922
Wait. Okay, those photos from the boat,

13:49.932 --> 13:52.145
those were taken before my tapeworm diet.

13:52.155 --> 13:53.634
Before your what?

13:53.644 --> 13:54.994
A few weeks after the photo-bang,

13:55.004 --> 13:57.852
I went down to Mexico
and ingested a tapeworm.

13:57.862 --> 14:00.175
For months, I could eat whatever
I wanted and still lose weight.

14:00.185 --> 14:02.924
I paid a pretty peso for it,
but it was totally worth it,

14:02.934 --> 14:05.614
- until it finally killed me.
- Yeah.

14:05.624 --> 14:07.867
Someone should probably put
a warning on those things.

14:07.877 --> 14:09.584
- I know.
- Anyway,

14:09.594 --> 14:10.844
what are you telling me this for?

14:10.854 --> 14:12.030
Don't you see?

14:12.037 --> 14:14.596
I mean, right before I died,
I was at my ideal body weight,

14:14.606 --> 14:16.521
but I don't have any pictures of it.

14:16.531 --> 14:17.980
Not even a little selfie?

14:17.990 --> 14:20.531
No, I was too weak to lift the camera.

14:20.541 --> 14:25.335
Okay. I'm not gonna go dig up your corpse

14:25.345 --> 14:27.092
and take creepy pictures of it.

14:27.101 --> 14:29.017
- No, of course not.
- Okay, good because...

14:29.027 --> 14:32.272
- No, those pictures should be sexy.
- Yes. A... wait, what?

14:32.282 --> 14:34.496
Sexy, but tasteful.

14:34.506 --> 14:36.818
Oh.

14:40.838 --> 14:42.823
(Dramatic theme playing)

14:45.542 --> 14:47.587
Roofie: The things we do for pa-chank.

14:47.597 --> 14:49.483
Kevin: Oh, the things you do for pa-chank.

14:49.493 --> 14:51.597
I'm doing this for
ill-fitting women's clothing.

14:51.607 --> 14:53.562
From last season, no less.

14:53.572 --> 14:55.874
What happened to the
advice about the principle?

14:55.884 --> 14:57.740
Never going out of your
way to impress a femmie?

14:57.750 --> 15:00.390
We're about to dig up a
grave so you can get laid.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.537
Roofie: The principle applies,
okay? It's just complicated.

15:03.546 --> 15:06.494
You gotta get a girl to
a tipping point, right?

15:06.504 --> 15:08.807
And you gotta do whatever
to push her over the edge.

15:08.817 --> 15:11.229
You sound like a real Reed Kelly right now.

15:11.238 --> 15:13.124
- Reed Kelly?
- Yeah. You're exploitering me.

15:13.134 --> 15:14.613
What? You think I wanna be here?

15:14.623 --> 15:16.697
What? Oh, I don't know.
You tell me, exploiterer.

15:16.707 --> 15:19.585
- Let's just get this over with.
- Yeah.

15:19.595 --> 15:21.590
(Dramatic theme playing)

15:24.270 --> 15:26.285
Roofie: Yo, man, I'm freaked out, man.

15:26.295 --> 15:28.012
I'm, like, wondering what's under here,

15:28.022 --> 15:30.563
like it's a model dead
chick that's gonna pop up

15:30.573 --> 15:31.992
like tales from the crypt, like

15:32.002 --> 15:33.411
(Cackles)

15:33.421 --> 15:35.575
What? No. She's only
been dead for two weeks.

15:35.585 --> 15:39.118
Probably an embalmed body
takes months to decompose.

15:39.128 --> 15:40.944
How do you even know that?

15:40.954 --> 15:44.160
Because, Roofie, I know some
stuff about some stuff, okay?

15:44.170 --> 15:48.140
I don't ask you how much a
quarter pound of weed weighs.

15:49.440 --> 15:51.921
- (Shovel hits casket)
- Look. This is it.

15:51.931 --> 15:53.916
(Suspenseful theme playing)

16:03.107 --> 16:04.298
Okay.

16:06.750 --> 16:08.129
- Good. You ready?
- Yeah.

16:08.139 --> 16:10.154
All right, on the count of 30.

16:10.164 --> 16:12.079
One...

16:12.089 --> 16:13.638
- Two...
- Come on, man.

16:13.648 --> 16:15.325
What? All right, okay.

16:15.335 --> 16:17.915
(Both gasp)

16:17.925 --> 16:19.811
- She looks like a damn corpse.
- Beautiful.

16:22.034 --> 16:24.645
She was a handsome lady.

16:24.654 --> 16:27.563
So, what should I do? Should I,
like, try and make her smile?

16:27.572 --> 16:29.770
No, give her the duck lips
like everybody got on.

16:29.771 --> 16:33.895
Oh. Oh, good. Good call.

16:33.905 --> 16:35.155
Roofie: Ooh.

16:35.165 --> 16:37.547
- Oh!
- Aw, nuts, I think I broke her jaw.

16:37.557 --> 16:39.105
- What's the matter with you?
- I don't know.

16:39.115 --> 16:41.855
My weight just shifted. I...
let me see if I can fix it.

16:41.865 --> 16:45.110
- Oh, no, it's okay.
- Dislocation. Just fix it, fix it.

16:45.120 --> 16:47.165
All right. I got it.

16:47.175 --> 16:50.083
There we go.

16:50.093 --> 16:51.601
What is that?

16:51.611 --> 16:56.048
- (Hissing)
- (Both screaming)

16:56.058 --> 16:57.546
Goddamn it.

16:58.916 --> 17:00.861
- Oh, my God.
- Kill it, kill it, kill it!

17:00.871 --> 17:03.938
- Die!
- Kill it! Kill it!

17:03.948 --> 17:05.893
Oh, it's the Mexican
tapeworm from the diet.

17:05.903 --> 17:08.653
It's Medusa's cousin.

17:08.662 --> 17:10.707
Okay, get the picture, get the picture.

17:10.717 --> 17:13.655
- Oh! God! So gross.
- I'm gonna get the picture.

17:13.665 --> 17:16.344
(Both screaming)

17:16.354 --> 17:17.903
Kevin: Did you get it? Did you get it?

17:17.913 --> 17:19.987
- Roofie: I got it.
- Kevin: Oh, good.

17:19.997 --> 17:22.806
- Alice: You're kidding me, right?
- What do you mean?

17:22.816 --> 17:24.404
You look so thin.

17:24.414 --> 17:27.648
- Yo, what's she saying?
- Hold on.

17:27.659 --> 17:29.207
Look at my hair and make-up in these.

17:29.217 --> 17:31.331
I mean, what, was I styled by a mortician?

17:31.341 --> 17:33.614
- Well, yeah.
- Not to mention

17:33.624 --> 17:35.579
I'm not wearing United
States of Apparel in these.

17:35.589 --> 17:37.336
They'll never put them up on the wall.

17:37.346 --> 17:38.855
That was the whole point of this, remember?

17:38.865 --> 17:40.780
I do, I do.

17:40.790 --> 17:44.760
She's upset about the hair and
makeup and clothing choices.

17:45.167 --> 17:48.403
So she want us to go back to the
cemetery, re-exhume her body,

17:48.412 --> 17:50.527
and go all extreme makeover on her ass?

17:50.536 --> 17:52.254
(Both laugh)

17:52.263 --> 17:55.102
Wait, wait, wait. That's
actually a good idea.

17:55.112 --> 17:57.097
- Huh?
- A makeover?

17:57.107 --> 17:58.496
Roofie: Wait, what?

18:02.476 --> 18:04.461
(Upbeat theme playing)

18:19.885 --> 18:21.840
(Inaudible dialogue)

18:43.824 --> 18:45.909
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

18:45.919 --> 18:47.765
- What don't you know?
- Girl: Mommy, look.

18:47.775 --> 18:50.425
I wanna look just like
that girl when I grow up.

18:52.777 --> 18:54.792
Did you hear that little girl?

18:54.802 --> 18:56.320
What, the one that wants to grow up

18:56.330 --> 18:58.841
and look like a malnourished
corpse? Yeah, I heard her.

18:58.851 --> 19:02.255
My whole life, I've been
taught by magazines and movies

19:02.265 --> 19:05.273
that being thin was what
made me worth anything.

19:05.282 --> 19:08.756
That girl might develop an
eating disorder because of me.

19:08.766 --> 19:10.712
It's me. I'm part of the problem.

19:10.721 --> 19:13.828
Which means...

19:13.838 --> 19:16.776
That I'm finally a real model.

19:16.786 --> 19:18.205
(Alice laughs)

19:18.215 --> 19:21.123
Yeah, that's it, that's what that means.

19:21.133 --> 19:22.959
Oh, yes. Oh, yeah.

19:27.028 --> 19:28.845
- Yes.
- That's how you do it.

19:28.855 --> 19:31.743
- Now I can roll around and...
- N'Cole: Hey!

19:33.470 --> 19:35.018
What the hell's all of this?

19:35.028 --> 19:37.003
Another ghost case solved, honey melon.

19:37.013 --> 19:38.532
It was easy. All we had to do

19:38.542 --> 19:40.358
was convince Kelly to put up these photos.

19:40.368 --> 19:42.869
Yeah, and he put it up over mine.

19:42.879 --> 19:45.390
We through, Roofie. And you,

19:45.400 --> 19:47.087
you're not getting that
leftover merchandise.

19:47.097 --> 19:50.471
- Oh, come on. Damn it.
- This is...

19:50.481 --> 19:52.387
I thought you didn't want the merchandise.

19:52.397 --> 19:55.543
I didn't want the merchandise.
But now that I can't have it,

19:55.553 --> 19:56.734
all I can think about is the...

19:56.744 --> 19:58.422
- The principle.
- See?

19:58.431 --> 19:59.881
- It does play.
- See?

19:59.890 --> 20:02.669
- I get it now. I see it crystal clear.
- Crystal clear.

20:02.679 --> 20:04.694
- Gotta give you credit, man.
- Hey.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.781
Does kind of suck we didn't
get anything from today though.

20:07.791 --> 20:11.552
Hm. I mean, we got to...
the facial was good.

20:11.562 --> 20:13.250
The makeover thing, that was kind of cool.

20:13.260 --> 20:15.374
The cucumbers and...

20:15.384 --> 20:17.895
Uh, the baseball game was pretty good.

20:17.905 --> 20:20.545
- What day are you talking about?
- Oh. Never mind.

20:20.555 --> 20:22.470
That's another day. You're
talking about today.

20:22.480 --> 20:24.088
- Today.
- Today was good. Yeah.

20:24.098 --> 20:26.182
- Let's get manis and pedis.
- Yeah, I'm starving.

20:33.269 --> 20:36.316
I wonder if I have body issues.

20:36.326 --> 20:38.995
I don't think so.

20:39.005 --> 20:41.149
You definitely have body
issues, little buddy.

20:41.159 --> 20:42.539
(Laughs)

20:42.549 --> 20:45.586
Look at you, you got such a weird body.

20:45.596 --> 20:48.275
Well, I think maybe we
should do a little acid

20:48.285 --> 20:52.087
and reward ourselves for a
job well done. I think so.

20:52.097 --> 20:54.479
Down the hatch. Ohh.

20:58.518 --> 21:00.831
Hey, excuse me, Holmes?

21:00.841 --> 21:02.826
(Mysterious theme playing)

21:04.820 --> 21:08.185
Oh, come on. What are you?
The ghost of the tapeworm?

21:08.195 --> 21:10.170
Well, I'm out of here. Come on, man.

21:10.180 --> 21:13.247
I'm just trying to get home
to see mi familia in Mexico.

21:13.257 --> 21:16.095
No, no, I'm not dealing with this.

21:16.105 --> 21:17.584
I got a head full of acid.

21:17.594 --> 21:19.609
Oh, come on, man, I can pay you.

21:19.619 --> 21:21.763
I can pay you real good.

21:21.773 --> 21:23.847
- Oh.
- Let's go, man.

21:23.857 --> 21:26.060
I can't move on till I know they're okay.

21:26.070 --> 21:28.224
Come on, cholo. Arriba.

21:31.211 --> 21:33.196
(Latin dance theme playing)

21:37.008 --> 21:39.449
