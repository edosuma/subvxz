<i>EMMA: A few months ago I
discovered I had a twin sister.</i>

00:03.255 --> 00:05.607
<i>And then she asked me to take her place,</i>

00:05.650 --> 00:07.885
<i>keep the secret, find our real mother</i>

00:07.919 --> 00:09.887
<i>and try to stay alive.</i>

00:10.566 --> 00:11.891
<i>Put yourself in my shoes.</i>

00:12.281 --> 00:14.559
<i>How long could you keep up the lying game?</i>

00:14.943 --> 00:16.544
Theresa is missing.

00:16.578 --> 00:17.778
Give me one night... tonight.

00:17.812 --> 00:19.780
You are my brother!

00:19.814 --> 00:22.449
And you lied right to my face.

00:22.484 --> 00:23.450
Everything okay?

00:23.485 --> 00:24.618
Dan threw him out.

00:24.653 --> 00:27.321
You're always welcome to stay on the couch.

00:32.194 --> 00:33.194
Ah!

00:33.228 --> 00:34.361
I just want to know where I stand.

00:34.396 --> 00:36.864
You're going to a hotel with Alec?

00:36.898 --> 00:37.998
That's none of your business.

00:38.033 --> 00:40.067
What makes you think that's what I want?

00:40.101 --> 00:42.136
I kissed you.

00:42.170 --> 00:43.137
One-half for you,

00:43.171 --> 00:45.673
the other half I'm saving for Emma.

00:45.707 --> 00:47.708
What does she have over you?

00:47.742 --> 00:49.677
Let's just say I have Rebecca's trust.

00:49.711 --> 00:51.445
<i>So, yesterday, I saw Rebecca in her bedroom</i>

00:51.479 --> 00:53.514
<i>locking this box in a cabinet.</i>

00:53.548 --> 00:54.715
(Maddie shrieks)

00:54.749 --> 00:57.184
You would do anything to
protect me, wouldn't you?

00:57.219 --> 00:57.618
Anything.

01:00.488 --> 01:03.090
DAN: Theresa!

01:06.061 --> 01:07.962
Dan, you know you can't go there.

01:07.996 --> 01:10.064
Get away from me! Get
the hell away from me!

01:10.098 --> 01:11.098
Hey, hey, come on, man!

01:11.132 --> 01:12.933
Hey, we can take your car.

01:12.968 --> 01:14.168
You can take your car and meet 'em there.

01:14.202 --> 01:15.836
I just need to see...

01:15.870 --> 01:17.071
I just need to be with her.

01:17.105 --> 01:19.873
There's nothing else you can do.

01:19.908 --> 01:21.108
Like hell there isn't.

01:28.817 --> 01:30.517
Look at you people.

01:30.552 --> 01:32.786
With all your secrets, your lies.

01:34.831 --> 01:37.333
Someone here did this.

01:37.367 --> 01:39.435
I'm gonna find out who it is.

01:39.469 --> 01:41.470
And when I do, I swear to God!

01:41.505 --> 01:45.141
Hey, man, you're blowing it.

01:45.175 --> 01:47.143
We're gonna do this,
we're gonna do it right,

01:47.177 --> 01:49.445
but we're gonna do it by the book.

01:49.479 --> 01:51.013
Hey, let's just go.

01:51.048 --> 01:52.248
You have my word.

01:52.282 --> 01:54.150
Let's just go.

01:59.956 --> 02:01.857
- Emma...
- I have to.

02:01.892 --> 02:03.092
Emma, come on. Emma...

02:03.126 --> 02:05.828
(indistinct radio transmission)

02:13.937 --> 02:15.571
I'm so sorry.

02:16.840 --> 02:19.575
I feel... that this is awful.

02:19.609 --> 02:21.377
Yeah, it is.

02:55.479 --> 02:58.114
I don't know how appropriate

02:58.148 --> 02:59.415
No, don't cancel.

02:59.449 --> 03:02.118
Just find another keynote speaker.

03:04.154 --> 03:06.088
Listen, I got to jump.

03:39.156 --> 03:40.523
Take it easy, big guy.

03:42.259 --> 03:45.561
If it's any consolation,
I know just how you feel.

03:45.645 --> 03:47.613
You really know how I feel, Alec?

03:47.647 --> 03:49.415
Because I just said good-bye

03:49.449 --> 03:52.351
to the only woman I'll ever love.

03:52.385 --> 03:55.554
And, well, look at that.

03:55.589 --> 03:57.423
I can't even feel this.

03:57.457 --> 04:00.125
Listen, Dan, if you need...
if you need some time...

04:00.160 --> 04:02.328
No, no. I don't... I don't need time.

04:02.362 --> 04:05.264
I need the truth.

04:05.298 --> 04:07.266
And I need the facts.

04:07.300 --> 04:09.602
The fact is is Rebecca's the killer.

04:09.636 --> 04:11.570
See, that's a theory.

04:11.605 --> 04:15.241
What I don't know is what you told Theresa.

04:17.209 --> 04:22.348
I'm betting whatever it
was, is what got her killed.

04:22.382 --> 04:25.417
Listen... Whoa! Hey, hey.

04:25.452 --> 04:27.253
You're gonna tell me right now

04:27.287 --> 04:29.321
what happened to her, or I swear to God

04:29.389 --> 04:31.290
I will kill you right here in this hallway.

04:31.324 --> 04:34.260
I know, I know, I know
you're upset. It's okay.

04:34.294 --> 04:38.464
Okay, all right, there is something

04:38.498 --> 04:41.200
we've been keeping from you.

04:41.234 --> 04:43.202
Ethan...

04:43.236 --> 04:45.304
myself...

04:45.338 --> 04:46.572
Theresa,

04:46.606 --> 04:49.241
and the twins.

04:52.579 --> 04:56.582
What are you talking about, twins?

04:56.616 --> 05:00.519
There's another Sutton,
and her name's Emma.

05:04.424 --> 05:05.524
See ya, Thayer.

05:05.559 --> 05:07.326
THAYER: Sutton.

05:09.496 --> 05:14.333
Well, this changes everything.

05:14.367 --> 05:17.336
Back in my room, before the sirens,

05:17.370 --> 05:19.238
I asked you for the truth.

05:21.308 --> 05:23.475
I... I don't even remember.

05:23.510 --> 05:25.578
Yeah, you do.

05:25.612 --> 05:30.182
You were avoiding it then,
and you're avoiding it now.

05:30.216 --> 05:32.518
You cannot get Ethan out of your head.

05:32.552 --> 05:35.421
I felt it since we slept together.

05:35.455 --> 05:39.224
Right away, you started to pull back.

05:39.259 --> 05:41.319
And now, tonight, at the pool,

05:41.627 --> 05:44.597
it's all about Ethan again.

05:44.591 --> 05:48.227
Yeah, just, I'm really confused.

05:48.261 --> 05:51.297
I have... it's just thoughts.

05:51.331 --> 05:53.132
I just have all this stuff in my head,

05:53.166 --> 05:55.301
and I haven't worked it out yet.

05:55.335 --> 05:56.368
I don't believe you.

05:56.403 --> 05:57.536
I think you already have.

05:57.571 --> 05:59.471
Thayer, that's not fair.

05:59.506 --> 06:02.374
No, no, not fair is you
keeping this from me.

06:02.409 --> 06:03.542
Being with me,

06:03.577 --> 06:05.444
getting what I thought was closer,

06:05.478 --> 06:07.279
when all you've been doing
is thinking about him!

06:07.314 --> 06:08.447
I told you, I haven't

06:08.481 --> 06:09.548
worked it out yet.

06:09.583 --> 06:11.283
Well, you need to, Emma.

06:13.119 --> 06:16.455
It's a clear-cut choice.
It's him or it's me.

06:19.492 --> 06:23.128
When you figure it out, let me know.

06:30.370 --> 06:32.504
(sighs)

06:35.141 --> 06:38.277
I'm sorry.

06:38.311 --> 06:41.213
Didn't tell you about Ted.
And I know every second

06:41.247 --> 06:43.048
I didn't say anything
could've made a difference.

06:45.218 --> 06:46.852
I kept it from you a whole night.

06:46.886 --> 06:49.655
A lot longer than that, little brother.

06:49.689 --> 06:51.657
A lot longer than that.

06:51.691 --> 06:55.561
(wood crashes)

06:55.595 --> 06:57.630
I'd say you been lying to me since

06:57.664 --> 07:01.734
the two of them have,
what? Switched places.

07:01.768 --> 07:03.535
That's right.

07:03.570 --> 07:06.605
I know all about 'em.

07:06.640 --> 07:08.374
Twins.

07:08.408 --> 07:09.308
Who told you?

07:09.342 --> 07:11.176
Who cares who told me?!

07:11.211 --> 07:15.247
The point is you should have said something

07:15.281 --> 07:17.082
<i>the second that you knew about it!</i>

07:19.285 --> 07:21.920
Your my brother.

07:21.955 --> 07:27.059
(wood clatters)

07:27.093 --> 07:28.861
- I'm, I'm sorry.
- What?!

07:28.895 --> 07:31.697
I don't know what else to say! I'm sorry!

07:32.999 --> 07:35.467
Let me tell you something.

07:42.642 --> 07:45.244
You got to make a choice.

07:45.278 --> 07:47.479
You either choose family...

07:47.514 --> 07:50.449
or you choose those twins.

07:52.485 --> 07:55.020
Because you've had it both ways...

07:55.055 --> 07:56.989
for far too long.

08:13.673 --> 08:15.641
(door opens)

08:19.615 --> 08:20.849
Hey.

08:20.883 --> 08:24.519
I wasn't sure where you'd end up tonight.

08:26.289 --> 08:28.456
How's Dan? Did you see him?

08:28.491 --> 08:33.260
Yeah. He's bad.

08:33.296 --> 08:37.432
I just came by to pick up my stuff.

08:39.268 --> 08:42.003
Look, Thayer said some stuff

08:42.038 --> 08:46.174
about how I'm not being honest with him,

08:46.209 --> 08:49.878
or with you or myself.

08:49.912 --> 08:51.646
He gave me an ultimatum.

08:51.681 --> 08:52.948
Stop right there.

08:52.982 --> 08:55.517
But no, I'm... I'm choosing you, Ethan.

08:56.752 --> 08:59.588
I...

09:01.524 --> 09:03.225
it's always been you.

09:10.166 --> 09:13.001
(scoffs)

09:13.035 --> 09:14.202
Emma, it's too late.

09:17.206 --> 09:19.140
What do you mean, it's too late?

09:19.175 --> 09:22.878
I've been lying to my brother for months.

09:22.912 --> 09:26.681
I kept the secret, and
now his fiancée is dead.

09:26.716 --> 09:29.517
That's got nothing to do with Thayer.

09:29.552 --> 09:32.754
It's because of my feelings for you.

09:32.788 --> 09:35.457
That's not true.

09:35.491 --> 09:36.591
Ethan, you can't do this.

09:36.626 --> 09:37.425
Do what?

09:37.460 --> 09:39.427
Be honest?

09:39.462 --> 09:41.563
Emma, I fell in love with you,

09:41.597 --> 09:43.431
and both our lives went to hell.

09:43.466 --> 09:46.935
Not because of us...

09:46.969 --> 09:48.136
Yes, it was because of us.

09:48.170 --> 09:50.939
We played along with the lie.

09:50.973 --> 09:53.008
We became the lie.

09:55.978 --> 09:58.113
I, I don't know what you're saying.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.718
I think you do.

10:03.753 --> 10:05.787
I think you knew this day was coming.

10:09.492 --> 10:12.494
Please don't say it.

10:15.464 --> 10:16.564
Okay.

10:18.467 --> 10:19.467
I won't.

10:27.009 --> 10:29.044
(sniffles)

10:40.117 --> 10:42.619
So, when do you stop:

10:42.653 --> 10:45.855
when the balls run our or
when you're not angry anymore?

10:45.890 --> 10:48.625
I'm just think that talking...
the gentle flapping of lips...

10:48.659 --> 10:51.294
might be a little less taxing.

10:51.595 --> 10:53.263
Hey!

10:53.297 --> 10:55.298
Sorry.

10:55.332 --> 10:57.434
Okay, I sense this is about Thayer.

10:57.468 --> 11:00.470
Or Ethan?

11:00.504 --> 11:02.272
Both.

11:02.306 --> 11:04.307
(sighs)

11:04.341 --> 11:06.242
It's about how I'm not being fair to them

11:06.277 --> 11:07.310
or anyone.

11:07.344 --> 11:10.180
And Theresa, what happened.

11:10.214 --> 11:12.182
And...

11:12.216 --> 11:15.952
about how when this all comes out,

11:15.986 --> 11:19.756
and I'm pretty sure it will really soon,

11:19.790 --> 11:22.025
I'm gonna lose everything.

11:22.059 --> 11:25.595
When you say "everything"...

11:25.629 --> 11:26.830
I mean everything.

11:26.864 --> 11:28.865
Especially Kristin.

11:28.899 --> 11:31.401
I mean, of all the lies that I have told,

11:31.435 --> 11:32.669
the worst have been to her,

11:32.703 --> 11:35.405
and she's so innocent in all of this.

11:35.439 --> 11:37.607
It's gonna hit her the hardest, Laurel.

11:40.344 --> 11:43.346
Our mom is strong and smart.

11:43.380 --> 11:45.248
Yeah, and she's been lied to by everyone,

11:45.282 --> 11:46.549
including her daughters.

11:46.584 --> 11:51.888
A strong, smart woman
would walk away from that.

11:54.158 --> 11:55.125
What?

11:56.927 --> 11:58.795
I was trying to think of something

11:58.829 --> 12:00.997
funny and witty to say, but
I can't think of anything.

12:01.031 --> 12:02.799
Yeah, 'cause you know it's possible.

12:02.833 --> 12:04.734
I'm gonna go take a shower.

12:07.905 --> 12:09.506
Don't worry.

12:09.540 --> 12:10.773
I'll get the balls.

12:10.808 --> 12:12.876
All one million of them.

12:12.910 --> 12:14.811
(sirens wailing, people talking)

12:21.619 --> 12:23.486
Hey.

12:23.521 --> 12:25.221
I didn't think you were coming back here.

12:25.256 --> 12:28.158
Sleep seems to be a complete waste of time,

12:28.142 --> 12:30.143
and I guess I just figure
that you would be off

12:30.177 --> 12:33.847
with, uh, some twin or another.

12:33.881 --> 12:35.982
I am done with all of that.

12:36.016 --> 12:38.852
I'm choosing family.

12:38.886 --> 12:39.986
Okay.

12:41.088 --> 12:43.857
Then I need to know everything

12:43.891 --> 12:46.593
about Rebecca Sewell Rybak

12:46.627 --> 12:48.361
and who's been working with her.

12:48.395 --> 12:52.398
You know that she's
the mother of the twins?

12:52.433 --> 12:56.603
And you know how Sutton
and Rebecca connected.

12:56.637 --> 12:59.172
Yes, and they've been
working together in secret,

12:59.206 --> 13:00.240
the whole Ted connection.

13:00.274 --> 13:01.508
I've got all that.

13:01.542 --> 13:05.411
Jordan was apparently doing stuff for her,

13:05.446 --> 13:07.981
but it was in the past.

13:08.015 --> 13:09.782
He's definitely on our side now.

13:09.817 --> 13:11.084
All right.

13:11.118 --> 13:13.753
It doesn't matter how
suspicious Rebecca looks.

13:13.787 --> 13:15.788
If we don't have any proof,

13:15.823 --> 13:16.990
she will walk.

13:17.024 --> 13:18.858
(knocking)

13:18.893 --> 13:20.660
- Yeah?
- OFFICER: This just came in.

13:20.694 --> 13:21.794
Preliminary autopsy report.

13:24.598 --> 13:26.766
"The cause of death:

13:26.800 --> 13:29.636
blunt-force trauma injuries,
injury to the head area.

13:29.670 --> 13:31.304
Probable weapon used:

13:31.338 --> 13:32.472
rusted metal object,

13:32.506 --> 13:34.541
fragments of green paint detected.

13:34.575 --> 13:36.476
No water found in the lungs.

13:36.510 --> 13:40.313
Time of death approximately
48 to 72 hours ago."

13:44.118 --> 13:46.052
"Limestone"?

13:46.086 --> 13:47.086
Limestone?

13:47.121 --> 13:49.722
Underneath her nails
and remnants on her clothing.

13:49.757 --> 13:51.024
Let's go.

13:50.958 --> 13:52.959
I started all this.

13:52.993 --> 13:54.961
If would have just told you I found Emma

13:54.995 --> 13:56.663
- from the beginning...
- Or if I would've told Kristin

13:56.697 --> 13:58.531
you were mine when I brought you home.

13:58.566 --> 14:00.467
Look, honey, you can try and
rewrite history all you want.

14:00.501 --> 14:02.502
- It doesn't change anything.
- But if Rebecca is involved...

14:02.536 --> 14:04.537
I don't care if Rebecca
did or didn't do it.

14:04.572 --> 14:06.639
I'll let Dan and the police
figure that out, honey.

14:06.674 --> 14:09.409
I have got to tell Kristin.
I can still save this family.

14:09.443 --> 14:11.111
But she'll find out that I've been working

14:11.145 --> 14:12.245
with Rebecca all this time.

14:12.279 --> 14:14.114
And what about Emma?

14:14.148 --> 14:16.049
Everyone who's on to
this has accepted Emma,

14:16.083 --> 14:19.018
and they see her as you, and...

14:19.053 --> 14:20.253
I know.

14:20.287 --> 14:21.988
She's the more improved version.

14:22.022 --> 14:23.189
I get that a lot.

14:23.224 --> 14:26.025
(sighs) Please, just...

14:26.060 --> 14:28.128
look at it from Mom's point of view.

14:28.162 --> 14:30.029
How many more lies can she take?

14:30.064 --> 14:32.065
If we dump this on her right now,

14:32.099 --> 14:33.867
it will blow up in our faces.

14:33.901 --> 14:37.470
And then if that happens,
she may never forgive us

14:37.505 --> 14:38.738
and then we're all rejected.

14:38.772 --> 14:40.440
We can't take that chance.

14:40.474 --> 14:42.709
We just need more time, Dad,

14:42.743 --> 14:45.612
for me and for Emma.

14:45.646 --> 14:48.214
Promise me, Dad.

14:48.249 --> 14:50.416
Please.

14:53.254 --> 14:55.221
Hello, Emma.

14:55.256 --> 14:58.258
I'm really not going to
have this conversation.

14:58.292 --> 15:01.861
Okay, then I'll talk and you listen.

15:03.297 --> 15:05.131
I know you know the truth

15:05.166 --> 15:07.700
and that I've been working with Sutton.

15:07.735 --> 15:09.769
And I think you know my motive also:

15:09.803 --> 15:12.572
to reunite our family,

15:12.606 --> 15:15.808
Ted and Sutton... 

15:15.843 --> 15:17.877
and you.

15:17.912 --> 15:20.547
I told you.

15:20.581 --> 15:21.648
I don't care.

15:21.682 --> 15:24.617
But you need to know

15:24.652 --> 15:26.486
how much I love you,

15:26.520 --> 15:29.455
how I've always loved you.

15:29.490 --> 15:33.159
And I never, never wanted you separated

15:33.194 --> 15:34.260
from Sutton.

15:34.295 --> 15:37.931
I wanted you together in-in a nice home

15:37.965 --> 15:39.265
with a nice family,

15:39.300 --> 15:41.968
and if I had known that
Alec was gonna split you up,

15:42.002 --> 15:43.069
I would've stopped it.

15:43.103 --> 15:44.671
You have to believe me.

15:44.705 --> 15:45.939
You know what? I want to believe you.

15:45.928 --> 15:46.895
So much.

15:46.929 --> 15:48.530
But you came to town,

15:48.564 --> 15:50.498
and you destroyed a family.

15:50.533 --> 15:53.768
- You did nothing but tear us apart.
- I didn't handle it right.

15:53.802 --> 15:56.337
Yeah, you sure as hell didn't.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.374
Emma?

15:59.408 --> 16:00.575
You know what, no.

16:00.609 --> 16:02.443
I have to ask you something,

16:02.478 --> 16:04.179
and I've been wanting to ask it

16:04.213 --> 16:06.181
ever since I found out you were my mother.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.282
Okay.

16:07.316 --> 16:10.885
Did you even look at us

16:10.920 --> 16:14.222
before you let Alec take us away?

16:14.256 --> 16:15.757
Yes, I did.

16:15.791 --> 16:19.928
And I held you, one in each arm.

16:19.962 --> 16:23.031
You looked up at me, both of you,

16:23.065 --> 16:27.535
with your big, beautiful eyes and...

16:27.570 --> 16:30.838
you were so quiet and so full of love.

16:32.608 --> 16:35.276
And then I kissed you,

16:35.311 --> 16:36.411
each of you,

16:36.445 --> 16:38.146
and, um...

16:38.180 --> 16:40.348
And you gave us away.

16:43.152 --> 16:45.086
Yeah.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.921
I gave you away.

16:51.160 --> 16:56.631
Emma, I wasn't capable
enough to care for you.

16:56.665 --> 16:57.932
Oh, but you care now?

16:57.967 --> 17:02.537
I have cared for you every
single day since I gave you up.

17:02.571 --> 17:04.539
This has been a terrible struggle for me.

17:04.573 --> 17:05.607
A struggle?

17:05.641 --> 17:06.641
Yes.

17:06.675 --> 17:08.443
You want to know a struggle, Mom?

17:08.477 --> 17:10.578
Try foster care.

17:10.613 --> 17:13.548
Try six different homes,

17:13.582 --> 17:15.450
a dozen schools.

17:15.483 --> 17:18.219
You know, I didn't even
know what a hug felt like

17:18.253 --> 17:19.520
until I got here.

17:19.555 --> 17:21.089
I'm so sorry.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.223
- No.
- Baby, I'm so sorry!

17:22.258 --> 17:23.358
I am, too.

17:26.295 --> 17:29.364
(sniffles, panting)

17:29.398 --> 17:33.234
DAN: So, we're 3.1 miles from the cemetery.

17:33.269 --> 17:35.803
Uh...

17:35.838 --> 17:36.904
tire tracks,

17:36.939 --> 17:38.906
footprints all around, obviously.

17:38.941 --> 17:40.908
Heel prints, high heel prints over here,

17:40.943 --> 17:41.943
over here.

17:41.977 --> 17:45.813
There's evidence that, uh,

17:45.848 --> 17:47.749
Theresa's hands were...

17:47.783 --> 17:50.518
(sighs) were bound.

17:50.552 --> 17:51.753
Struck from behind?

17:51.787 --> 17:54.355
Potential murder weapons everywhere.

17:54.390 --> 17:57.358
DAN: Whatever it was,

17:57.393 --> 17:58.660
she most likely took it with her.

17:58.694 --> 18:00.395
She?

18:03.465 --> 18:04.532
I got it from here, Danny. Nice work.

18:12.074 --> 18:14.208
(crying)

18:22.384 --> 18:23.985
- Are you okay, man?
- No.

18:24.019 --> 18:27.188
No.

18:27.222 --> 18:29.724
She died... she died right here.

18:29.758 --> 18:30.892
She died right here.

18:30.926 --> 18:31.993
Can't take it.

18:34.897 --> 18:36.698
I didn't know if I should have hugged her

18:36.732 --> 18:37.899
or slapped her.

18:37.933 --> 18:40.802
You didn't believe her, did you?

18:40.836 --> 18:41.803
I don't know.

18:41.837 --> 18:43.471
Emma, are you insane?

18:43.505 --> 18:45.540
You cannot go soft like this.

18:45.574 --> 18:47.342
She's our mother.

18:47.376 --> 18:51.279
I... I want to believe that
at some point, she loved us.

18:51.313 --> 18:52.580
Well, of course she did.

18:54.183 --> 18:57.085
I've felt the same things you're feeling,

18:57.119 --> 18:58.386
and that's when I fell under her spell,

18:58.420 --> 19:00.254
and now it's happening to you.

19:00.289 --> 19:02.090
Just, it's hard.

19:02.124 --> 19:04.926
Believe me, I know.

19:04.960 --> 19:08.830
I mean, to think that
our mother is a killer...

19:08.864 --> 19:10.965
(sighs)

19:10.999 --> 19:14.669
We just need to both be strong right now.

19:14.703 --> 19:16.003
Together.

19:18.640 --> 19:21.542
I'm realizing something.

19:21.577 --> 19:23.511
Do I have anything to do with it?

19:23.545 --> 19:25.613
Everything.

19:25.647 --> 19:28.583
When I was bouncing
around from home to home,

19:28.617 --> 19:30.385
all I ever did was run away,

19:30.419 --> 19:35.323
and just being you and living your life,

19:35.357 --> 19:37.392
it's taught me to stand up for myself.

19:39.561 --> 19:42.430
And stay?

19:42.464 --> 19:44.399
And stay.

19:57.316 --> 19:59.084
- <i>SUTTON: I DVR'd this.
- These are live images</i>

19:59.118 --> 20:01.053
from the abandoned Taconic
quarry where Scottsdale PD

20:01.087 --> 20:03.021
has established a perimeter.

20:03.056 --> 20:05.223
We're awaiting confirmation,
but sources tell us

20:05.258 --> 20:06.925
this is where noted defense attorney

20:06.959 --> 20:08.260
Theresa Lopez was killed.

20:08.294 --> 20:11.096
I wonder what's in that bag.

20:11.130 --> 20:13.665
I don't know. It's too small to see.

20:13.700 --> 20:15.834
Well, can't Thayer like,
blow it up on his computer?

20:15.868 --> 20:17.569
You'd lose too much resolution.

20:17.603 --> 20:18.804
Okay, we need somebody to tell us

20:18.838 --> 20:20.672
what's in that bag so I can tell them

20:20.707 --> 20:21.873
if it somehow points to Rebecca.

20:21.908 --> 20:23.542
Who's gonna tell us that?

20:23.576 --> 20:25.644
The police? We're kids.

20:25.678 --> 20:27.746
The don't really care about us.

20:27.780 --> 20:29.347
I'm not talking about the police.

20:29.382 --> 20:30.549
I'm talking about him.

20:33.286 --> 20:38.323
I don't want to push my way into anything.

20:38.357 --> 20:41.126
Maybe we can just go together.

20:41.160 --> 20:42.961
I can't.

20:42.995 --> 20:45.063
Ethan doesn't want anything to do with me,

20:45.098 --> 20:46.865
and for a good reason.

20:49.235 --> 20:52.971
You should just go to him.

20:53.005 --> 20:54.773
Are you sure?

20:54.807 --> 20:56.942
Yeah, I'll stay here.

20:56.976 --> 20:58.910
Be careful.

20:58.945 --> 21:01.646
Okay.

21:01.681 --> 21:03.582
Wish me luck.

21:06.753 --> 21:09.621
So that's it then?

21:09.655 --> 21:12.524
You're just gonna hand Ethan
over on a silver platter?

21:12.558 --> 21:14.493
Laurel, stop. Ethan and I are done.

21:14.527 --> 21:15.627
For good, forever.

21:15.661 --> 21:18.130
We are not getting back
together. It is done.

21:18.164 --> 21:21.399
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

21:21.434 --> 21:23.401
What about Thayer?

21:23.436 --> 21:25.036
Have you talked to him?

21:25.071 --> 21:27.305
He's totally MIA,

21:27.340 --> 21:29.007
and I haven't called

21:29.041 --> 21:32.110
because I have no idea what to say to him.

21:32.145 --> 21:34.846
I...

21:34.881 --> 21:37.015
I'm not sure how he's gonna take it.

21:59.472 --> 22:03.175
Accordingly, Mrs. Mercer
expects to keep physical custody

22:03.209 --> 22:05.243
of both daughters, as well as the house,

22:05.278 --> 22:07.412
the cabin at the lake,

22:07.446 --> 22:09.347
50% of all material assets...

22:09.382 --> 22:11.983
Fine. Whatever you want.

22:12.018 --> 22:13.151
You know what I want?

22:13.186 --> 22:15.987
To know what happened to that $20,000.

22:18.090 --> 22:19.858
I don't even care anymore.

22:19.892 --> 22:22.194
I just don't want to spend
the rest of my life wondering.

22:22.228 --> 22:24.162
Can you give us a minute, please?

22:39.445 --> 22:42.314
The truth is, Kristin, I love you.

22:42.348 --> 22:44.516
I've loved you since the
day I met you in ninth grade,

22:44.550 --> 22:46.651
with your cheerleader skirt,
your horn-rimmed glasses.

22:46.686 --> 22:48.620
- Ted...
- And I have never stopped loving you.

22:48.654 --> 22:50.322
No matter what my mistakes,

22:50.356 --> 22:52.123
there hasn't been one day
when I haven't loved you.

22:52.158 --> 22:54.159
And I know for the rest
of my life, there won't be!

22:54.193 --> 22:57.395
And there's nothing that
I want to do more right now

22:57.430 --> 22:59.064
than to come clean about everything,

22:59.098 --> 23:00.165
not just the money.

23:00.199 --> 23:01.333
What else is there?

23:01.367 --> 23:02.901
- I can't.
- Please?

23:02.935 --> 23:05.036
I can't! Right now I
can't. I made a promise,

23:05.071 --> 23:08.840
- and I owe it to our daughters to keep it.
- Our daughters?

23:08.875 --> 23:11.776
- Yes!
- What do they have to do with this?

23:11.811 --> 23:13.011
- Kristin, please.
- You know what? Just forget it.

23:13.045 --> 23:14.813
This is just too much.

23:14.847 --> 23:16.915
(Ted slaps table)

23:25.591 --> 23:27.359
I don't know which one you are

23:27.426 --> 23:29.427
or what the hell you're doing here,

23:29.462 --> 23:30.528
but you got five minutes,

23:30.563 --> 23:33.231
and then I want you off my property.

23:33.266 --> 23:35.267
Sorry.

23:35.301 --> 23:36.468
Look, Emma and I...

23:36.502 --> 23:38.536
Stop, stop. I'm not gonna
talk about Emma right now.

23:38.571 --> 23:43.208
No, you're right. This isn't about her.

23:43.242 --> 23:45.010
All the lies started with me.

23:45.044 --> 23:47.279
And if I could take all
of them back, I would.

23:47.313 --> 23:50.048
I lost so much

23:50.082 --> 23:51.316
along the way, including you.

23:51.350 --> 23:54.185
Sutton, I... I can't do this, okay?

23:54.220 --> 23:55.140
You don't have to do anything.

23:55.141 --> 23:56.085
It's me. I want to help.

23:57.023 --> 23:58.890
I saw the news and the crime scene.

23:58.925 --> 23:59.925
What did they find?

23:59.959 --> 24:02.727
Come on, please.

24:02.762 --> 24:04.696
I spent all that time with Rebecca.

24:04.730 --> 24:08.733
I can at least tell you
whether or not something...

24:08.768 --> 24:11.670
Let me try and make this up to you.

24:11.704 --> 24:14.472
What was in that plastic bag?

24:17.410 --> 24:20.345
It was a... a necklace.

24:20.379 --> 24:22.514
It's like a little broken heart.

24:25.484 --> 24:26.484
What?

24:30.423 --> 24:32.123
Did it look like this?

24:36.195 --> 24:38.964
It's a match.

24:38.998 --> 24:41.666
Rebecca had two of them.
She gave one to Sutton.

24:41.701 --> 24:42.901
She must have lost the other at the quarry.

24:42.935 --> 24:44.069
Now I want my warrant.

24:44.103 --> 24:45.870
You got it, Dan. Go get her.

24:54.580 --> 24:57.649
Pack a bag... fast.

24:57.683 --> 25:01.519
(indistinct radio transmission,
helicopter overhead)

25:02.688 --> 25:05.590
(sirens approach)

25:05.624 --> 25:07.325
Upstairs...

25:19.038 --> 25:21.206
MAN (over radio): Harry, all
clear down here. Search warrant.

25:25.244 --> 25:26.945
The house is clear.

25:26.979 --> 25:29.914
I know. She's gone.

25:29.949 --> 25:31.916
Damn it!

25:34.791 --> 25:35.924
<i>Come on Sutton, think!
You spent all that time</i>

25:35.959 --> 25:37.693
with Rebecca. You must know where she is!

25:37.727 --> 25:40.596
Okay, stop. We should just let her go.

25:40.630 --> 25:41.730
What? Why?

25:41.764 --> 25:42.764
After all this?

25:42.799 --> 25:45.567
Because if she gets caught,

25:45.602 --> 25:47.269
she's gonna be the one to tell.

25:47.303 --> 25:49.371
Is that really how you want our mother

25:49.405 --> 25:52.107
to hear the truth about who you are?

25:52.142 --> 25:54.343
(computer beeps)

25:55.512 --> 25:57.346
It's Rebecca.

26:03.086 --> 26:06.989
Look at you two. You're so beautiful.

26:07.023 --> 26:11.827
God, this is so far from
how I imagined we'd...

26:11.861 --> 26:12.861
Where are you?

26:12.896 --> 26:14.663
I can't...

26:14.697 --> 26:17.833
Sutton, we were so close

26:17.867 --> 26:19.801
to having everything that we dreamed of...

26:19.836 --> 26:22.638
until it went so wrong.

26:22.672 --> 26:25.307
Yeah, 'cause you killed two people.

26:25.341 --> 26:28.377
No, I didn't. I'm being framed!

26:28.411 --> 26:30.546
- By who?
- I don't know!

26:30.580 --> 26:33.382
But I had nothing to do with
Derek or Theresa's murder!

26:33.416 --> 26:34.483
You have to believe me!

26:34.517 --> 26:36.218
But that necklace...

26:36.252 --> 26:38.086
It was meant for you.

26:38.121 --> 26:41.190
I had it in a locked in,
in a drawer in my bedroom.

26:41.224 --> 26:43.825
I was saving it for you.

26:43.860 --> 26:44.893
Why would I...?

26:44.928 --> 26:46.828
Look, just... where are you?

26:46.863 --> 26:48.130
I do not want you in danger.

26:48.164 --> 26:50.132
I don't know who's behind this

26:50.166 --> 26:52.034
or why they're trying
to pin it on me, but...

26:54.003 --> 26:56.705
Please, girls.

26:56.739 --> 26:58.507
I can't believe I'm leaving you again.

26:58.541 --> 27:01.777
I've spent so long trying
to find you and get you back.

27:04.514 --> 27:07.416
You have to believe me that...

27:07.450 --> 27:11.286
I love you so much. So much!

27:11.321 --> 27:14.122
I gotta go.

27:22.332 --> 27:24.800
Thank God you're here.
I wasn't sure you'd come.

27:24.834 --> 27:26.969
Yeah, me neither.

27:27.003 --> 27:29.805
I just want to tell you that
I'm so sorry about all this.

27:29.839 --> 27:33.041
You know, we'll just have to
start over and start new lives.

27:33.076 --> 27:34.042
Together?

27:34.077 --> 27:36.945
Well, of course.

27:36.980 --> 27:39.581
I mean, leaving Ted and my girls,

27:39.616 --> 27:40.716
it's devastating enough.

27:40.750 --> 27:43.385
I can't imagine doing this on my own.

27:43.419 --> 27:44.653
What's in this for me?

27:44.687 --> 27:46.622
Why the hell would I go with you?

27:46.751 --> 27:49.353
Well, because if you don't,
then I'll just make a call

27:49.387 --> 27:51.521
and make sure that you're
sent away for what you've done.

27:51.556 --> 27:54.524
I've got Mads and Alec on my side.

27:54.559 --> 27:57.394
Hmm. I'll take my chances
with the accessory charge.

27:57.428 --> 27:59.463
I'm not talking about
what you've done for me.

27:59.497 --> 28:01.198
I'm talking about what
you did to your brother

28:01.232 --> 28:03.300
in Los Angeles.

28:09.907 --> 28:11.074
You ready?

28:11.109 --> 28:14.878
Yeah. Let's go.

28:15.042 --> 28:17.944
(chuckles) I told Theresa

28:17.979 --> 28:23.116
that I didn't want to
wear a suit to our wedding.

28:23.150 --> 28:26.720
And here I am sporting one to her memorial.

28:28.990 --> 28:32.626
I think this is, this is
good, what Alec's doing.

28:32.660 --> 28:35.529
Making this charity thing
a tribute for Theresa,

28:35.563 --> 28:37.564
naming that clinic after her.

28:37.598 --> 28:42.502
See, Alec doesn't, he doesn't
do good things for no reason.

28:45.573 --> 28:47.474
I'm sure he feels responsible.

28:47.588 --> 28:49.356
We all do.

28:49.390 --> 28:51.291
Well, I'm not going for Alec.

28:51.325 --> 28:54.327
I'm going for Theresa.

28:58.332 --> 29:00.500
Sutton, you look beautiful.

29:00.534 --> 29:03.136
Thanks.

29:03.170 --> 29:04.938
It's a sad occasion.

29:04.972 --> 29:06.339
Yeah. I just want

29:06.374 --> 29:08.241
to be there for Dan and Ethan.

29:08.275 --> 29:10.076
What about you?

29:10.111 --> 29:12.879
Are you going for Alec?

29:12.913 --> 29:14.781
Are you guys... together?

29:14.815 --> 29:18.985
No, no, we're not.

29:19.020 --> 29:21.621
I don't know what we are, actually.

29:23.824 --> 29:27.727
I mean, I could lie, say I'm done with him,

29:27.762 --> 29:30.363
that what happened was a crazy mistake,

29:30.398 --> 29:32.565
but I'm trying to set an
example for you and Laurel;

29:32.600 --> 29:35.335
total honesty.

29:35.369 --> 29:37.203
Of course.

29:37.238 --> 29:40.373
So if there's ever anything
you want to tell me...

29:43.344 --> 29:46.012
There is, actually.

29:46.047 --> 29:52.185
I... I, honestly, there is
something I want... to tell you.

29:55.890 --> 29:57.190
I just... I love you...

29:58.125 --> 29:59.993
Mom.

30:00.861 --> 30:02.729
Honey, I love you, too.

30:02.763 --> 30:03.997
I'm sorry. I forgot.

30:04.031 --> 30:05.699
There's something I need to do.

30:05.733 --> 30:06.800
I'll meet you there.

30:12.907 --> 30:16.776
Dad, what are you doing here?

30:16.811 --> 30:20.747
I came to tell Sutton that I
can't keep my promise any longer.

30:20.781 --> 30:23.283
That I have to tell Kristin everything.

30:23.317 --> 30:26.252
And I told him that he can't. Not yet.

30:26.287 --> 30:28.354
Sutton, I know that you are scared,

30:28.389 --> 30:32.158
but we have to have learned by now,

30:32.193 --> 30:34.194
- these lies are getting us nowhere.
- He's right.

30:34.228 --> 30:36.896
I can't keep doing this either.

30:36.931 --> 30:39.265
You know I love Kristin
as if she were my own.

30:39.300 --> 30:42.769
And even if she hates me for
everything that I've done,

30:42.837 --> 30:46.773
every minute that I am lying to her, I...

30:46.807 --> 30:48.942
it just feels like it's breaking my heart.

30:51.946 --> 30:54.514
TED: So here's what we're gonna do:

30:54.548 --> 30:57.383
We're gonna go to this
thing together tonight,

30:57.418 --> 30:59.285
Then, afterwards, I will get Kristin alone

30:59.320 --> 31:02.522
and I will introduce you... as Emma.

31:06.160 --> 31:08.361
No, that's, that's not...
that's not my place.

31:12.266 --> 31:14.334
Can you just give us a second, please?

31:14.368 --> 31:17.237
Okay. Okay.

31:22.743 --> 31:24.677
Okay, look, I'm gonna go into hiding

31:24.712 --> 31:26.613
until you tell me to come forward.

31:26.647 --> 31:33.787
<i>Whenever... if ever
Kristin wants to meet me,</i>

31:33.821 --> 31:36.456
you'll just, you'll let me know.

31:36.490 --> 31:38.625
Please, Emma, things with Kristin and me

31:38.659 --> 31:41.561
have gotten got so ugly,
she might throw me out.

31:41.595 --> 31:43.263
She might...

31:43.297 --> 31:46.366
she might want you instead.

31:46.400 --> 31:49.102
Sutton, come on.

31:49.136 --> 31:55.141
This is your family.

31:55.176 --> 31:56.910
It always was.

32:00.014 --> 32:02.949
He was always your boyfriend.

32:02.983 --> 32:05.652
I wish that were true.

32:05.686 --> 32:10.657
Well, either way, this isn't
just about a boy anymore.

32:12.560 --> 32:14.894
You're gonna need this dress.

32:29.249 --> 32:31.417
Let me get this for you.

32:42.363 --> 32:43.820
Yuck. 

32:44.364 --> 32:45.965
Right?

32:48.335 --> 32:50.837
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

32:54.975 --> 32:57.043
Hey.

32:57.077 --> 32:58.878
What happened?

32:58.912 --> 33:00.012
Where's Emma?

33:00.047 --> 33:01.881
We switched back.

33:01.915 --> 33:03.683
For the last time.

33:06.019 --> 33:08.654
Uh... sorry. This is...?

33:08.689 --> 33:09.789
It's Sutton.

33:09.823 --> 33:10.923
Great.

33:10.958 --> 33:14.794
Um, listen, I just want to thank you for

33:14.828 --> 33:18.264
stepping up and helping us
crack the case against Rebecca,

33:18.298 --> 33:20.366
even though it meant turning
against your own mother.

33:20.400 --> 33:22.268
Of course.

33:22.302 --> 33:24.203
I... but Kristin's my mother.

33:24.238 --> 33:25.505
Okay.

33:25.539 --> 33:30.143
But whether or not we find Rebecca,

33:30.177 --> 33:32.145
I'll always remember what you did.

33:40.120 --> 33:40.961
Where's Jordan?

33:41.122 --> 33:43.956
- Gone.
- Gone how?

33:43.991 --> 33:45.892
I haven't seen him since last night,

33:45.926 --> 33:47.927
and I think he may have
taken off with Rebecca.

33:50.097 --> 33:51.664
(sighs)

33:51.698 --> 33:53.799
Look, honey, I know our
life has been a little crazy

33:53.834 --> 33:55.535
ever since Rebecca entered the picture,

33:55.569 --> 33:58.704
but, uh... now that she's gone,

33:58.739 --> 34:01.674
I think things are gonna get...

34:01.708 --> 34:02.842
much simpler.

34:02.876 --> 34:05.411
So you're happy she just took off?

34:05.445 --> 34:06.445
Well, no.

34:06.480 --> 34:08.514
I mean, as a D.A. I wish
she had stuck around.

34:08.549 --> 34:09.614
I would've liked to have prosecuted her.

34:09.650 --> 34:12.351
Convicted her.

34:12.386 --> 34:15.521
Punished her for what she did to us.

34:15.556 --> 34:18.024
But as a dad, yes.

34:18.058 --> 34:20.293
I'm glad she's gone.

34:20.327 --> 34:22.895
I want my family back.

34:22.929 --> 34:24.197
I want Thayer back.

34:24.231 --> 34:26.966
So you haven't given up on him?

34:27.000 --> 34:29.969
Honey, I love T.

34:30.003 --> 34:33.072
No matter what's happened,
he's always gonna be my boy.

34:43.550 --> 34:45.585
Hey.

34:45.619 --> 34:46.752
You all right?

34:46.786 --> 34:49.655
I've been better.

34:49.690 --> 34:52.525
I should've called or come sooner.

34:52.559 --> 34:53.492
I just... It's fine.

34:53.527 --> 34:56.161
Kind of got my answer.

34:58.498 --> 35:00.466
Thayer, I'm...

35:00.500 --> 35:02.134
I'm so sorry.

35:04.271 --> 35:06.005
I know I've been really unfair to you,

35:06.039 --> 35:07.940
and I owe you an explanation.

35:07.975 --> 35:10.276
Okay.

35:10.310 --> 35:12.144
Why don't you shut that door?

35:21.622 --> 35:23.556
(door closing)

35:23.590 --> 35:25.524
Alec, thank you.

35:25.559 --> 35:27.693
Um...

35:29.429 --> 35:31.564
thank you for honoring Theresa tonight.

35:31.598 --> 35:32.632
I really appreciate that.

35:34.334 --> 35:38.504
Uh, but mostly I want to thank...

35:38.538 --> 35:42.341
I want to thank Theresa for loving me,

35:42.376 --> 35:45.478
and for agreeing to marry me,

35:45.512 --> 35:51.250
and showing me what it means
to live a life of purpose.

35:51.285 --> 35:55.087
Her passion is, ultimately,
what got her killed,

35:55.122 --> 35:59.959
but it's also the legacy
that she has left behind.

35:59.993 --> 36:01.794
- And...
- (whispering): Excuse me, sir, sorry.

36:01.828 --> 36:03.095
- A lady asked me to give this to you.
- Sure.

36:03.130 --> 36:05.097
This clinic will allow her work

36:05.132 --> 36:07.833
to go on forever.

36:07.868 --> 36:09.635
And for that, I thank you all.

36:09.670 --> 36:11.804
(applause)

36:15.742 --> 36:17.710
Hello, Alec.

36:18.845 --> 36:21.380
Thanks for the call.

36:21.415 --> 36:23.482
But I decided

36:23.517 --> 36:27.553
I couldn't run away after all.

36:30.290 --> 36:31.223
You here to turn yourself in?

36:31.258 --> 36:33.426
Quite the opposite.

36:35.195 --> 36:36.529
I figured it out.

36:39.066 --> 36:42.034
All this time, I thought it was Ted.

36:42.069 --> 36:44.103
And it was him I was trying to protect.

36:44.137 --> 36:45.938
But now...

36:45.972 --> 36:49.909
I know who the real killer is.

36:49.943 --> 36:52.712
And I know you do, too.

36:56.869 --> 36:58.203
- Where have you been?
- (sighs)

36:58.237 --> 37:00.205
I thought... we all thought...

37:00.239 --> 37:02.741
- That I ran off with Rebecca?
- But you didn't. You're here.

37:02.775 --> 37:03.942
She wanted me to.

37:03.976 --> 37:05.677
She threatened that if I didn't,

37:05.711 --> 37:07.746
she would turn me in for
everything she has on me.

37:07.780 --> 37:09.014
So what are you gonna do? Run away?

37:09.048 --> 37:11.516
I'm gonna face up to it.

37:11.551 --> 37:13.385
I'm gonna turn myself in.

37:14.487 --> 37:16.755
But not till tomorrow.

37:16.789 --> 37:19.324
Tonight, I thought maybe you
and I could ride up to Howl Peak?

37:19.358 --> 37:20.692
Hmm? Just the two of us?

37:20.726 --> 37:23.261
Mm. Mm?

37:23.296 --> 37:25.430
I know it sounds crazy and stupid.

37:25.465 --> 37:28.233
Sometimes crazy and stupid is good.

37:28.267 --> 37:30.502
Yeah.

37:37.009 --> 37:39.010
My car's the other way.

37:39.045 --> 37:40.378
We can get you out of here. I can hide you.

37:40.413 --> 37:42.314
No.

37:42.348 --> 37:43.949
No more hiding.

37:43.983 --> 37:45.116
But what are they gonna do to you?

37:45.151 --> 37:46.985
Ship me back to L.A.? I don't know.

37:47.019 --> 37:49.187
- It doesn't matter. It's over.
- No! Jordan, no.

37:49.222 --> 37:51.089
Please.

37:59.899 --> 38:00.999
Forget you ever saw me.

38:01.033 --> 38:02.634
Forget you ever knew me.

38:02.668 --> 38:04.002
Jordan Lyle?

38:04.036 --> 38:05.837
Don't, please. He didn't do anything.

38:05.872 --> 38:07.606
Currently of Scottsdale?

38:07.640 --> 38:09.541
- Yes, sir. That's me.
- Turn around, please.

38:11.511 --> 38:13.512
Just go back to the party, Mads.

38:13.546 --> 38:14.546
Jordan Lyle, you're
under arrest for murder.

38:14.580 --> 38:15.647
Murder?

38:15.681 --> 38:17.415
He had nothing to do with Theresa.

38:17.450 --> 38:18.550
He didn't murder Derek...

38:18.584 --> 38:20.452
Look, he's not talking about them!

38:20.486 --> 38:22.521
Mads, he's talking about my brother.

38:25.324 --> 38:27.459
About what Dan said to you earlier...

38:27.493 --> 38:30.228
Let me guess: you don't agree with him.

38:30.263 --> 38:31.363
He meant it when he thanked you.

38:34.100 --> 38:36.201
It's been a crazy ride.

38:39.138 --> 38:41.006
I put you through a lot.

38:41.040 --> 38:42.340
We put each other through a lot.

38:43.976 --> 38:45.210
Anyway, no matter what happens,

38:45.244 --> 38:47.178
I'm going to work really hard

38:47.213 --> 38:49.748
to prove that...

38:49.782 --> 38:50.849
I'm a good person.

38:50.883 --> 38:52.050
No matter what happens?

38:52.084 --> 38:55.053
Ted's telling Kristin everything tonight.

38:55.087 --> 38:56.688
Ah.

38:56.722 --> 38:58.023
And I just...

38:58.057 --> 39:01.826
have this sick feeling that
they'll choose Emma over me.

39:02.962 --> 39:04.596
It's possible.

39:08.868 --> 39:10.769
Yeah, um...

39:10.803 --> 39:12.504
the way I deceived everyone,

39:12.538 --> 39:14.639
it's more than possible.

39:16.475 --> 39:19.477
But something else could happen.

39:21.314 --> 39:23.281
They could forgive you.

39:24.417 --> 39:26.184
What are you saying?

39:28.354 --> 39:30.422
I'm saying...

39:30.489 --> 39:33.058
that I forgive you.

39:38.998 --> 39:42.233
You engineered it all.

39:45.037 --> 39:46.171
Everything that's happened.

39:47.840 --> 39:50.942
And it all went down like clockwork.

39:50.977 --> 39:53.945
You know, you got a
pretty vivid imagination

39:53.980 --> 39:55.814
for a cold-blooded killer.

39:55.881 --> 39:57.983
But this blows it, doesn't it?

39:58.985 --> 40:01.586
You wanted me on the run,

40:01.621 --> 40:03.989
to spend my life as a fugitive,

40:04.023 --> 40:08.727
so they'd never look for the real killer.

40:08.761 --> 40:10.462
Honey, come on.

40:10.496 --> 40:12.464
We've been down this
road before, haven't we?

40:12.498 --> 40:13.765
Not this road.

40:17.570 --> 40:24.576
Isn't it amazing how far we'll go

40:24.610 --> 40:28.346
to protect the ones we love?

40:31.584 --> 40:34.252
Kristin...

40:34.286 --> 40:36.154
I'm ready to tell you

40:36.188 --> 40:38.023
what I couldn't tell you before.

40:38.057 --> 40:39.991
I talked to the girls...

40:40.026 --> 40:41.993
there's something that you should know.

40:42.028 --> 40:44.229
Something you should have
known months, even years, ago.

40:44.263 --> 40:46.965
It's about Sutton, and you should really...

40:46.999 --> 40:48.199
(crashing)

40:58.244 --> 41:00.879
KRISTIN: Oh my God, Alec.

41:00.913 --> 41:04.182
I just, I wanted to talk
about it. I... I couldn't...

41:04.216 --> 41:06.851
just... let it go.

41:06.886 --> 41:09.020
Yeah, don't worry about it.

41:11.057 --> 41:13.758
But I am worried about it.

41:13.793 --> 41:16.995
After tonight, I have no idea
what my life will look like.

41:17.029 --> 41:20.899
If I stay here,

41:20.933 --> 41:22.834
or... or leave...

41:24.870 --> 41:26.638
But I...

41:26.672 --> 41:28.840
I just, I don't want things
to end badly between us.

41:30.943 --> 41:32.644
I still want to be friends.

41:34.947 --> 41:37.749
Okay?

41:37.783 --> 41:40.652
I think you should go now.

41:40.686 --> 41:41.653
- Thayer...
- I mean it.

41:41.687 --> 41:42.854
Could we please just talk about it...

41:42.888 --> 41:44.756
You need to go. Go!

41:44.790 --> 41:46.658
Now.

41:46.692 --> 41:48.860
I'm s... I'm sorry.
