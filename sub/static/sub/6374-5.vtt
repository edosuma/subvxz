00:00.600 --> 00:02.900
 <I>Previously On "Ugly Betty"...</I>
Justin?

00:03.200 --> 00:05.500
You're Supposed To Be Working
On Your Algebra, Not Making Out.

00:05.500 --> 00:09.300
Back Off.
You're Not My Dad.
I Miss Him So Much.

00:09.300 --> 00:12.900
I Know, <I>Mija.</I>
But It'll Get Better.
I Want To Postpone

00:12.900 --> 00:16.700
Wilhelmina Is Losing
Her Grip On Bradford.

00:16.700 --> 00:19.300
The Bradford Meade/
Wilhelmina Slater Wedding

00:19.300 --> 00:21.900
Is Back On.
How'd The Meeting
With The Advertiser Go?

00:21.900 --> 00:22.700
I Think
I Lost The Account.

00:22.800 --> 00:25.600
Guy Had Some Issues
With Our Staff.
What? With Who?

00:26.100 --> 00:28.000
You.
I Think We Should
Lose The Account.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.700
What?
We Don't Need Atlantic Attire
Or Their Money.

00:30.700 --> 00:34.700
So You Want
To Destroy "Mode"?
Well, There's Only Room

00:35.000 --> 00:36.700
At Meade Publications.

00:36.800 --> 00:39.300
So The Baby's Yours.
I'm Soy, Betty.

00:39.300 --> 00:40.600
You Should Go.

00:43.100 --> 00:45.800
Henry, I'm Sorry.
I Just Can't See You.

00:45.800 --> 00:47.400
Not With The Way
Everything Turned Out.

00:47.400 --> 00:48.600
The Baby's Yours.

00:48.600 --> 00:50.600
You're Going Back To Tucson
To Be With Charlie.

00:50.600 --> 00:53.000
I Am Not Going Back
To Be With Charlie.

00:53.100 --> 00:55.500
I Am Going Back
To Be A Father To My Child.

00:55.500 --> 00:57.500
Maybe We Can
Still Do This.

00:57.500 --> 01:00.300
Long Distance? It--
That'll Never Work.

01:00.300 --> 01:02.900
I Just Think It's Better
If We Just Avoid Each Other

01:03.000 --> 01:04.400
Until You Leave.

01:04.500 --> 01:07.100
So That's It.
Just Like That?

01:07.100 --> 01:09.300
Yes, I Think
That's What's Best.

01:09.300 --> 01:12.600
Excuse Me, Do You Mind
Not Leaning On Me?
Who's Leaning On You?

01:12.600 --> 01:14.400
Well, You See,
That's None Of Your Concern.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.100
People Can Lean On Me
All They Want.
Okay.

01:16.100 --> 01:19.800
No, Not You.
Okay, So I'm Here
For Five More Months.

01:19.800 --> 01:23.500
How Do We Make This Work?
When You Need
Daniel's Signature, Send Kenny.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.500
Okay. What About Meals?

01:25.600 --> 01:28.800
I Go To The Cafeteria
At 1:00.
I Guess I Can Do 12:00.

01:28.900 --> 01:31.300
Except For Taco Tuesdays.
I'm Always Afraid

01:31.400 --> 01:34.600
They're Gonna Run Out,
So I Have To Go Early.
Okay, Sure.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.900
Well, Maybe This Whole
Avoidance Thing Will Work.

01:37.900 --> 01:41.000
Yeah, We Never Have To
See Each Other At All.

01:45.700 --> 01:46.100
Ugh!

01:46.800 --> 01:48.900

丑女贝蒂 第二季第5集

01:50.300 --> 01:53.000
Starting Tomorrow,
I'll Take The Subway.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.000
Uh-Huh.

01:59.300 --> 01:59.600
Morning.

01:59.800 --> 02:02.600
Hey, Don't Fill Up On Fruit.
I'm Making <I>Machaca.</I>

02:02.700 --> 02:05.200
Oh, No, I Can't Stay.
It's Thursday.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.900
Santos And I Do
Our Lotto Scratchers

02:06.900 --> 02:08.699
At The Cemetery.
Oh.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.200
Hey, Kiddo.
I'm Making <I>Machaca.</I>

02:12.300 --> 02:14.900
I Know You Say
It Gives You Hips But--
I'm Meeting My Friends.

02:14.900 --> 02:17.400
Oh, Are You All Trying Out
For "The Music Man"?

02:17.400 --> 02:19.700
I Read In The School Paper
Auditions Are Today.

02:19.800 --> 02:22.300
Drama Club?
That's For Losers.

02:22.300 --> 02:24.800
You're The President.
You Even Started The Club.

02:25.300 --> 02:26.500
Whatever. Here.

02:27.100 --> 02:28.200
Oh.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.400
Okay. Bye.

02:32.500 --> 02:33.600
Hey.

02:33.600 --> 02:37.000
Do You Even Know
What You Signed?
Oh, I Don't Know, <I>Papi.</I>

02:37.600 --> 02:40.000
Maybe It Was
For Mail-Order Crack.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Come On, It Was
A Permission Slip For Something.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.500
It's Fine. Bye.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.900
Did You Get It?

02:50.900 --> 02:53.000
One Note Excusing Me
From The Field Trip Tomorrow.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.500
Yeah, Suck That,
Queens County Farm Museum.

02:55.700 --> 02:57.700
So What
Are We Gonna Do?

02:57.700 --> 02:59.600
We'll Take My Family's Car
Out For A Ride.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.100
My Dad Taught Me
How To Drive.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.000
Car Thieves Are Hot.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.100
Marc Jacobs Wants To Send
Over Bags. I Said Yes.

03:08.100 --> 03:11.000
Kathy Griffin Is Begging
For A Date. I Said No.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.400
And Your Father Wants To Have
You And Alexis Over For Dinner

03:13.400 --> 03:15.900
With Him And Wilhelmina.
I Didn't Know What To Say.

03:15.900 --> 03:19.100
Great. I Get To Spend Time
With My Futurestep-Monster.

03:19.100 --> 03:22.700
One Big Crappy Family.
A Grudging "Yes" It Is.
Speaking Of Which,

03:22.700 --> 03:24.700
Your Step-Monster Has Called
A Meeting In Her Office

03:24.700 --> 03:27.100
In 30 Seconds.
Wait, Is That Why
We're Headed This Way?

03:27.100 --> 03:28.800
I Was Hoping We Were
Going To Get Danish.

03:31.500 --> 03:32.600
Are You Really
That Good,

03:32.600 --> 03:34.100
Or Did You Just Happen
To Have That On You?

03:34.100 --> 03:36.200
You'll Never Know. Oh.

03:38.700 --> 03:40.000
Are You Okay With This?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.500
You Can Skip The Meeting
If You Want.

03:41.500 --> 03:44.500
No, I Won't Let This
Get In The Way Of My Job.

03:44.700 --> 03:45.700
I'm A Professional.

03:45.700 --> 03:47.900
Besides, It's Not Like
I'm Writing "Betty Loves Henry"

03:47.900 --> 03:49.300
All Over My Notebook.

03:49.300 --> 03:50.600
Um, You--
Shut Up.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.900
(Wilhelmina) Thank You
For Joining Us, Daniel.

03:55.900 --> 03:57.900
Why Are You In Here? Where Are
All The Other Departments?

03:58.000 --> 04:00.400
Oh, I Only Invited Ad Sales
And Accounting.

04:00.400 --> 04:01.300
I Figured It'd Be Easier

04:01.400 --> 04:04.300
To Discuss
The Advertising Situation

04:04.300 --> 04:07.600
In A Smaller,
Le Judgmental Group.
(Whispering) Excuse Me,

04:07.800 --> 04:10.900
Over There To That Chair?
Well, That's Very Thoughtful
Of You, Wilhelmina,

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
But I Really Don't Have
Anything To Hide.

04:15.500 --> 04:16.100
I've Been Very Open
About This Whole Thing.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.800
And If You Could Just Move
To That Chair. It's Empty.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.000
I Think We All Know
Atlantic Attire

04:20.100 --> 04:22.000
Pulled Their Advertising
From "Mode."
(Normal Voice) No, No, No.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.700
I Didn't Mean You.
I Meant Him.
Betty? Please.

04:25.700 --> 04:28.100
Oh, You--You Didn't Know?

04:28.100 --> 04:29.800
Uh, Once The News Leaked

04:29.800 --> 04:32.000
That Atlantic Attire
Was Pulling Out,

04:32.000 --> 04:34.400
Well,
Other Companies Followed.

04:34.600 --> 04:37.000
Just How Many Advertisers
Are We Talking About?

04:37.000 --> 04:38.700
Well,
As Of This Morning,

04:38.700 --> 04:41.400
Um... 52%.

04:43.900 --> 04:45.200
(Low Voice) Your Foot
Just Touched My Knee.

04:45.200 --> 04:48.300
(Low Voice) Your Knee
Just Touched My Foot.
Well, Here's The Line.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.200
So What's
Our Financial Outlook?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.800
Well, Uh,
If We Keep Touching--

04:54.800 --> 04:56.500
Spending
At The Current Rate,

04:56.500 --> 04:59.600
Then "Mode" Will Be
Out Of Business In 90 Days.

05:01.000 --> 05:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:09.800 --> 05:11.200
(Yoga) Yo, Fish!

05:13.400 --> 05:16.600
You Staying In Here All Day
Or We Gon' Play Tennis?

05:17.000 --> 05:19.900
Yoga,
I've Been Drinking--

05:19.900 --> 05:21.300
I Mean, Thinking.

05:21.300 --> 05:23.600
Uh, Actually,
They're Both Right.

05:23.600 --> 05:26.700
Maybe The South Of France
Isn't Such A Good Idea.

05:26.700 --> 05:28.600
I Am So Glad
To Hear You Say That.

05:28.600 --> 05:31.100
'Cause At Piano Man's
Wine Tasting Last Night,

05:31.100 --> 05:34.700
Everybody Was Saying That
Positano Is The New Monaco.

05:34.700 --> 05:36.700
I Don't Want
To Run Anymore.

05:36.700 --> 05:38.500
I'm Turning Myself In.

05:38.500 --> 05:39.900
Whoa, Whoa,
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.700
That Ain't What
We've Been Talkin' About.

05:41.700 --> 05:43.200
I Can't Leave My Children.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.300
Bradford May Have Moved On,

05:44.300 --> 05:46.700
But Daniel And Alexis
Still Need Me.

05:46.700 --> 05:48.800
Need You?
You Gon' Be In Prison.

05:54.800 --> 05:55.900
I need You.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.700
Between The Two Of Us,
You The One More Likely

05:59.800 --> 06:01.900
To Have A Rich Friend
With An Empty Villa.

06:02.800 --> 06:04.600
Well, At Least If
I'm Behind Bars,

06:04.700 --> 06:05.800
They Can Come Visit.

06:07.700 --> 06:08.900
I'm Sorry, Yoga.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.100
All Right.

06:12.100 --> 06:13.700
If That's The Way
You Want To Play This,

06:13.700 --> 06:15.500
I'm-A Start Packing.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.400
We Don't Have
Anything To Pack.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.900
No, But They Do.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.900
It Was Just Stupid To Think
That We Could Avoid Each Other

06:24.900 --> 06:26.600
When We Work
In The Same Building.

06:26.900 --> 06:27.900
Now I Don't Know
What To Do.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.600
You See, The Problem Is You've
Got No One Else To Focus On.

06:31.300 --> 06:34.800
Not Bad, Not Bad.
Turn. Thank You.

06:36.100 --> 06:37.100
You Need To Date.

06:37.400 --> 06:40.200
Da? No, I Am Not Ready
To Get Involved Again.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.500
Who Said Anything
About Getting Involved?

06:41.600 --> 06:44.800
All You Wanna Do
Is Have A Little Bit Of Fun.
Christina,

06:44.800 --> 06:46.700
Ten Minutes
Before The Fun Happens.

06:46.700 --> 06:48.600
Well, You Don't Know
What You're Missing, Do You?

06:48.600 --> 06:50.200
Okay, Turn.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.200
(Low Voice) Christina, What--
What Are You Doing?

06:57.200 --> 06:58.600
You Can't Alter Underwear.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.100
(Low Voice) Oh,
They Never Catch On.

07:00.800 --> 07:03.300
(Normal Voice)
Okay, Executive Decision--

07:03.300 --> 07:06.900
I'm Gonna Put Your Profile
On Bachelocity.Com.

07:06.900 --> 07:09.800
(Normal Voice) Internet Dating?
There Are Freaks Online.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.400
Why Don't You Just
Chop Me Into Pieces Yourself,

07:11.400 --> 07:14.700
And We Can Cut Out
The Middleman?
Mm, They Don't Always

07:14.700 --> 07:18.500
I Don't Need Internet Dating.
I Can Get Over Henry Myself.

07:18.500 --> 07:19.900
I'm Not <I>That</I> Desperate.

07:19.900 --> 07:21.400
(Man) You're
A Little Desperate.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.300
The Internet It Is.

Well, Doughnuts
And My Family...

07:50.800 --> 07:52.200
Ugh, And Eyeglass Cleaner.

07:52.300 --> 07:53.600
I Can't Stand It
When They Get Smudged.

07:53.700 --> 07:56.100
Yeah, You Might Want To
Sex It Up Just A Little Bit.

07:56.100 --> 07:59.400
Why? What Did You Put?
Well, Sex--Five Times.

08:00.100 --> 08:03.000
Oh, Well, Maybe
I'll Come Back To This One.

08:03.300 --> 08:05.600
Oh, Listen, Nobody Cares
About What You Write Anyway.

08:05.600 --> 08:06.700
All They Care About
Is That You've Got

08:06.700 --> 08:09.200
A Cute Little Photograph.
Now Smile.

08:11.400 --> 08:12.000
Ooh.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.700
Oh, No, I Wasn't Ready.
Do Another One.

08:15.700 --> 08:17.500
Okay, Smile.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.300
(Camera Shutter Clicks)
Oh, Well, That One's
A Little Bit Better.

08:19.300 --> 08:22.500
At Least You've Got
One Eye Open.
Head Down, Shoot From Above,

08:22.600 --> 08:24.400
Get Those Bangs To
Cover Those Caterpillars

08:24.400 --> 08:26.600
And Hide Your Chins
By Doing This.

08:27.700 --> 08:29.600
For God Sake,
Lose The Glasses.

08:29.600 --> 08:32.200
Amanda, I Wear Glasses.
I'm Not Gonna Lie.

08:32.299 --> 08:33.299
Whatever.

08:33.400 --> 08:36.100
But Guys Don't Make Passes
At Girls Who Are Fat.

08:36.700 --> 08:38.100
These Are The Shoes
I Borrowed.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.299
You Borrowed The Jimmy Choos.
This Is A Sandwich.

08:43.500 --> 08:45.500
You Usually Don't Open Up
The Box That Fast.

08:46.900 --> 08:47.900
I'll Be Right Back.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.100
Okay,
Let's Try This Again.

08:52.300 --> 08:53.800
Aah, Ham!

08:53.900 --> 08:55.900
Yeah!
That's Your Best One Yet.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.600
Graphics Wants You
To Sign Off On This.
Brilliant.

08:59.900 --> 09:00.900
But You Didn't Even
Look At It.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.100
The First Rule In Ruining
A Magazine Is Stop Caring.

09:04.200 --> 09:05.500
Uh, Why Don't You
Go Downstairs

09:05.600 --> 09:08.900
And Supervise
The Valentino Shoot?
Me? Supervise A Shoot?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.300
Whoa! You've Never Asked Me
To Supervise Anything Before.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.100
Wait A Minute,
Is This Part Of Your Plan

09:13.200 --> 09:16.200
To Make The Magazine Suck?
Do You Care? There'll Be
Male Models In Underwear.

09:16.300 --> 09:18.300
Mm, Not If
I Have My Way.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.500
Knock, Knock.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.500
Your Late.
Take Off Your Clothes.

09:31.500 --> 09:34.500
Ha Ha, Easy Sailor.
Buy A Girl A Drink First.

09:34.600 --> 09:37.400
Oh, I-I'm Sorry, I Thought
You Were The Underwear Model.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.300
Oh, No, No, No, No, No.

09:39.300 --> 09:41.400
I Am Supervising
This Shoot.
(Sizzles)

09:43.200 --> 09:44.400
But It's Funny
That You Mention That

09:44.500 --> 09:46.500
Because I Did Take
A Modeling Class Once.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.700
You Know, Thought About It,
Put It Away,

09:48.700 --> 09:50.800
Could Always Go Back
And Get It.

09:50.900 --> 09:54.400
Hmm, Hmm, Hmm, Hmm.
Ow.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.200
What Are You Laughing At?

09:57.200 --> 09:59.700
You, Uh, You Slapped
Your Own Ass Too Hard.

09:59.700 --> 10:00.600
That's Funny.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.800
Oh, Yeah, I Guess
That Is Funny. Ha Ha.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.600
Cliff St. Paul.
Marc St. James.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.800
Wow, We're Both Saints.
Is Yours Fake, Too?

10:06.900 --> 10:08.000
No.
Mine, Either.

10:08.100 --> 10:11.100
Are You Sure This
Doesn't Make Me Look Fat?

10:12.100 --> 10:13.400
(Sighs) I'll Sign
For That Package.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.800
Well, Please Let Him Be Dumb.
He Can't Have Everything.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.500
Oh. (Laughs)
I Put 'Em On Backward.

10:19.400 --> 10:20.100
Thank You.

10:20.500 --> 10:21.600
I Can Help You.

10:36.600 --> 10:37.200
Hello?

10:37.900 --> 10:39.100
(All) Hello.

10:39.100 --> 10:40.500
Oh, Hey, <I>Papi.</I>

10:40.500 --> 10:42.700
These Are My New Friends
From The Cemetery--

10:42.700 --> 10:46.700
Mabel, Esther, And Lucille.
They Lost Their Husbands, Too.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.400
Heart Attack.

10:48.500 --> 10:49.800
Liver Failure.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.600
Stroke On A Cruise.

10:52.500 --> 10:53.000
I'm Sorry.

10:53.100 --> 10:54.300
You Don't Get
Your Money Back,

10:54.400 --> 10:56.000
But They Don't
Tell You That.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.500
Oh, We're Maki A Quilt
From Our Husbands' Shirts.

10:59.500 --> 11:03.300
Our Dead Husbands.
Fun.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.600
Okay, I Decided
 Go With This One.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.400
I Was Gonna Use The One
That Says,

11:12.400 --> 11:16.400
"Drink Till She's Cute,"
But I Buried Him In It.

11:17.100 --> 11:18.400
(All) Aw.

11:20.100 --> 11:22.100
(Cliff) I Think
The Last Shot's The One.

11:22.100 --> 11:25.000
So This Whole Window Thing
You're Doing, It's Genius.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.900
I Love It.
Totally Get The Concept.

11:26.900 --> 11:30.400
You Have No Idea, Do You?
None Whatsoever.

11:30.400 --> 11:31.900
(Laughs)
Uh, "Rear Window."

11:32.800 --> 11:34.400
Hitchcock?
Never Saw It.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.300
Really?
It--It's Amazing.

11:36.300 --> 11:38.700
I-I-I Love Hitchcock.
What Aut "Psycho"?

11:38.700 --> 11:40.400
Uh, Work For One.
Does That Count?

11:40.400 --> 11:43.100
Hey, Did You Guys
See "Saw"?

11:43.100 --> 11:44.300
No.

11:44.300 --> 11:46.100
Wh--I Said "Seesaw."
(Laughs)

11:49.300 --> 11:49.800
Wow.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.800
(Gasps) I Know. Oh.

11:51.800 --> 11:54.100
Okay, You Have To Go
With Me Tomorrow Night.

11:54.100 --> 11:57.300
I'm Seeing "Psycho"
At The Film Forum.
Oh, That Sounds Like Fun.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.200
Maybe We Could
Grab A Beer Before.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.900
Uh, Sure, If By "Beer"
You Mean "Appletini."

12:01.900 --> 12:02.900
Okay.

12:03.900 --> 12:05.700
Gus, Rear Back
In The Window.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.600
What Is It, Girl?
Someone Felldown Their Well?

12:16.600 --> 12:18.700
Betty...
Internet Dating...

12:18.700 --> 12:20.100
Must Mock.

12:20.100 --> 12:21.800
(Gasps) Ooh, Bookmark It.
I Gotta Stick Around Here.

12:21.900 --> 12:22.800
I'm Trying To Work Up
The Nerve

12:22.900 --> 12:24.900
To Ask Out
"Hot Pants" Over There.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.600
Oh, You're Asking <I>Him</I> Out? Maybe
I'll Stay Here And Mock You.

12:28.700 --> 12:30.300
What? You Think
He's Out Of My League?

12:30.400 --> 12:32.300
He's A Nine. I'm An Eight.
He's A Ten. You're A Six.

12:32.400 --> 12:33.800
You're A Bitch.
I'm A Seven.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.400
Now I Know This Is
Going To Hurt A Bit,

12:38.600 --> 12:42.700
But For Starters, We Can
Save 8% By Printing On...

12:43.400 --> 12:44.400
Rice Paper.

12:45.800 --> 12:48.100
Look At That.
That's Not Terrible, Huh?

12:48.100 --> 12:50.700
I Can See You.
(Wilhelmina) Well, We Can
Just Say We're Going Green.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.300
People Will Do Anything If They
Think They're Saving A Tree.

12:53.300 --> 12:57.100
Which Brings Me To...
Soy Ink.

12:57.200 --> 12:59.300
I've Heard That Stuff
Tends To Rub Off.

12:59.400 --> 13:00.800
We Could Throw In
A Packet Of Wasabi,

13:00.900 --> 13:03.400
And Then
We All Got Lunch.
This Is Crazy.

13:03.500 --> 13:06.100
We're Ruining The Magazine,
And It's All My Fault.

13:06.100 --> 13:08.100
No, It's Not. It's My Fault.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.400
Alexis, I'm The One
Who Lost The Advertisers.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.900
Now, Now,
Stop Blaming Yourselves.

13:13.300 --> 13:14.800
It's Both Your Faults,

13:15.500 --> 13:16.800
But Fortunately,
I'm Here To Help.

13:16.900 --> 13:20.600
Now How Do You Feel
About Free Detergent Samples?

13:26.600 --> 13:27.900
B-Licious.

13:27.900 --> 13:29.100
Kenny.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.800
Henry Needs
Daniel's Tag On This.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.300
Okay. Oh, And Will You
Give Henry My Time Card?

13:33.900 --> 13:35.800
I Can't Make It
To The Accounting Department.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.600
Chicken.
Stay Out Of It.

13:38.200 --> 13:41.200
So B.T. Dubs, You Really Did
A Number On My Boy Henry.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.200
I Don't Even Think Porn
And Malt Liquor

13:43.300 --> 13:45.300
Can Heal The Damage
That You Have Inflicted.

13:45.300 --> 13:48.800
Kenny, You're From Greenwich.
Stop <I>Frontin'.</I>

13:48.800 --> 13:50.300
South Side, Yo.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.800
 <I>Chris-Tay,</I>
Oh, Lookin' Good.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.600
Oh, Go Away, Kenny.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.100
Listen, Why Don't You
Tell Your Girl To Throw My Man

13:56.100 --> 13:59.000
A Betty Biscuit Before
He Leaves For <I>Tucson?</I>
Tucson.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.300
It's Spelled "Tuc-Son."

14:00.400 --> 14:01.900
It Should Be Pronounced
"Tuck-Son."

14:02.000 --> 14:03.900
I Don't Understand
A Word That Man Says.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.600
Christina, Look. I Already
Have Responses To My Profile.

14:07.700 --> 14:11.700
15 Of Them. First One's
From Ilovetacos.

14:11.900 --> 14:13.100
I Love Tacos.

14:13.100 --> 14:14.700
Then Ilovechurros.

14:14.700 --> 14:15.700
I Love Churros.

14:15.700 --> 14:17.300
Ilovetortillas.

14:19.700 --> 14:21.900
Amanda,
You're <I>Not</I> Funny.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.100
(Laughs)
I'm A Little Funny.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.700
Look, There's One--
Niceguy47.

14:29.900 --> 14:32.100
Oh, It's A Real One.
Mm-Hmm.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.400
"I'd Love
To Go Out With You.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.300
"Your Profile Says
You Enjoy Bowling,

14:36.400 --> 14:39.000
So If You Have
Some <I>Spare</I> Time..."

14:39.100 --> 14:40.200
Oh.
Aw.

14:40.200 --> 14:41.100
I Don't Get It.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.400
"Yes, I Love Bowling."

14:47.400 --> 14:48.400
Send.

14:48.500 --> 14:49.900
Send That Again.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Why?
You Typed "Blowing."

14:58.400 --> 14:59.800
What Else Could They Do?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.800
We Weren't Due To Dock
In Puerto Vallarta

15:01.900 --> 15:03.300
For Two More Days.

15:03.700 --> 15:06.200
So They Put Him
In The Freezer,

15:06.200 --> 15:09.300
Right Next
To The Beef Tenderloin.
(Mabel) Done.

15:09.700 --> 15:12.100
One For
My Grandson's Birthday,

15:12.300 --> 15:14.100
And Then One
For Christmas,

15:14.200 --> 15:15.600
In Case I'm Dead.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.800
I Always Wondered
How My <I>Abuela</I>

15:17.800 --> 15:20.600
Got Such Crisp Bills
In The Cards She Sent.

15:22.500 --> 15:23.800
(Laughs) So What
Are We Doing Tomorrow?

15:23.800 --> 15:26.900
Tomorrow? Look At Her,
The Optimist.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.800
We're Taking
The Senior Center Bus

15:28.800 --> 15:30.300
To Rockaway Beach.

15:30.300 --> 15:34.300
The Beach Is
A Good Place To Die.
No, Home Is Best.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.700
I Always Thought The Mall
Would Be A Good Place To Die,

15:37.700 --> 15:39.000
But I'm A Shopper.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.700
You Know Where's
 <I>Not</I> A Good Place To Die?

15:42.700 --> 15:46.100
A Cruise Ship.
They Take Your Money.

15:46.100 --> 15:47.800
I'm Gonna Write
Another Letter.

15:47.800 --> 15:51.600
Ooh, That Reminds Me, I Have
To Write To That Cereal Company.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.200
I Counted.

15:53.200 --> 15:56.400
There's Not Two Scoops
Of Raisins In There.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.000
I'm Writing
The Networks.

15:58.100 --> 16:01.200
Why Won't They Bring Back
That "Highway To Heaven"?

16:01.200 --> 16:03.500
(Hilda) I Wish I Had
Someone To Write A Letter To.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.400
Maybe I'll Find Something
To Hate In Rockaway.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.300
(Mabel) You Coming, Too?

16:08.300 --> 16:11.500
Yeah, Sure. What Else
I Got Goin' On?

16:13.700 --> 16:14.300
Come On, Betty.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.600
Your Opinion
Really Matters To Me.

16:17.500 --> 16:21.500
Ll, The New One
Doesn't Really Say

16:21.700 --> 16:23.800
"Classy Fashion Magazine."

16:23.800 --> 16:27.300
It's More
"Where's Lindsay's Mug Shot?"

16:27.900 --> 16:29.900
Oh, And There It Is.

16:30.900 --> 16:34.000
Daniel, Wouldn't You Rather
Just Keep "Mode" The Way It Is

16:34.000 --> 16:36.300
And Go To Your Father
And Ask Him For Money?

16:36.300 --> 16:37.600
Yeah, But You've Met
My Family.

16:37.700 --> 16:39.100
My Mother Was Arrested
For Murder,

16:39.200 --> 16:40.700
And She's The Nice One.

16:40.800 --> 16:44.800
Yeah, But Do You Really Want
"Mode" Going Out Like <I>This?</I>

16:45.200 --> 16:47.600
Oh, Free Laundry Detergent.

16:48.400 --> 16:49.700
Yeah, Knock Yourself Out.

16:49.800 --> 16:50.800
Thanks.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.200
Why Are You Wearing
Your Lucky Sweater?

16:52.300 --> 16:53.500
It's Not Taco Tuesday.

16:53.600 --> 16:57.500
No, But I Have
An Appointment...

16:58.700 --> 17:01.700
At The Bowling Alley...
With A Boy.

17:03.400 --> 17:04.800
That's A Date.
Betty, You've Got A Date.

17:04.800 --> 17:07.000
I'm So Proud Of You
For Getting Back Out There.

17:07.099 --> 17:08.500
Me, Too.

17:42.600 --> 17:43.900
whore!(Speaking Spanish)

17:43.900 --> 17:46.800
you plotted with Lorenzo to steal my heart...

17:46.800 --> 17:48.199
and then steal my husband!

17:53.600 --> 17:54.900
Would You And The Golden Girls
Like A Snack?

17:55.100 --> 17:56.699
I've Got Some Soft Food.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.100
It's Almost Dinnertime.

17:58.100 --> 17:59.600
It's 3:15.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.700
(Gasps)
We're Gonna Be Late.

18:01.800 --> 18:04.100
It's The Early Bird Special.

18:04.600 --> 18:08.500
Ack! Mabel Left
Her Teeth Again. Ew.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.699
She's Gonna Need These
If She Wants The Roast Beef.

18:10.700 --> 18:15.000
Hold It. You Just
Put Teeth In Your Purse.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.799
What's Going On With You
And These Old Ladies?

18:17.800 --> 18:20.699
They're Fun.
Oh Yeah, "Stroke-On-A-Cruise"
 A Laugh Riot.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.199
They Get Me.
Ever Since Santos Died,

18:23.200 --> 18:25.100
Everyone Says, "I Know What
You're Going Through."

18:25.200 --> 18:26.600
Well, They Don't.

18:26.800 --> 18:29.099
They Don't Know What It's Like
To Wake Up Every Morning,

18:29.100 --> 18:31.600
Roll Over And Not See
That Person Next To You.

18:31.600 --> 18:34.700
These Women Do.
Yeah, Well,
I Do, Too, Hilda.

18:35.100 --> 18:37.600
Since I Lost Your Mother,
Not A Day Goes By

18:37.600 --> 18:39.700
That I Don't Miss Her.
I Know.

18:39.700 --> 18:42.200
But It Can't Mean
That Life Stops.

18:42.300 --> 18:44.700
You Still Have A Future
Ahead Of You.

18:44.700 --> 18:47.100
And You've Got A Son
That Needs You.

18:47.100 --> 18:50.800
Justin Is Fine.
I'm Fine.

18:51.400 --> 18:54.800
Well, Except For
This Shooting Pain In Myack.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.600
Feels Like Rain.

18:57.100 --> 18:59.400
All Right, Girls.
(Claps Hands) Let's Go.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.100
Look.

19:05.300 --> 19:07.300
This Is Soy Ink.

19:07.300 --> 19:09.100
This Is Dolce.

19:09.300 --> 19:11.399
Damn It. I've Gotta
Stop Doing That.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.199
Okay, So Maybe Soy Ink
Isn't The Best Option.

19:14.200 --> 19:15.300
We'll Figure
Something Else Out.

19:15.300 --> 19:18.600
We're Out Of Options.
You Know What We Have To Do.

19:19.600 --> 19:22.800
Oh, No. No.
I'm Not Going To Dad.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.399
He's Finally Staing
To Trust Me.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.899
H-How Can I Tell Him
I Lost Half Our Advertisers?

19:26.900 --> 19:28.899
You Can't, But I Can.

19:28.900 --> 19:30.500
I May Not Remember
The Last Couple Years,

19:30.500 --> 19:31.999
But I Know I Was
His Golden Boy.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.699
I'll Just Tell Him
It Was My Fault,

19:33.700 --> 19:37.200
And I'll Get The Money
From Him.
All Right.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.199
You Were Always The One Who
Could Get Away With Anything.

19:40.200 --> 19:41.499
I'll Be Right Back.

19:41.500 --> 19:44.500
This Golden Boy's Gotta Go
Wash Ink Off His Boobs.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.500
G-Stick,
You Sittin' Down?

19:52.500 --> 19:56.100
Um, Ye
You Can See I Am.

19:56.100 --> 20:01.100
Brace Yourself. Bad News
Vis-?Vis Your Old Lady.

20:01.100 --> 20:04.000
Oh, My God, My Mom?
Did She Fall Again?

20:04.000 --> 20:05.600
Nah, I'm Talkin'
About Betty.

20:05.600 --> 20:08.300
Oh, My God,
Did Betty Fall Again?
Worse.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.600
You Know I'm Hooked Up Like
Perez When It Comes To Gossip.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.700
I Hear Everything, Yo.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.600
That's Because You Pee
In The Ladies' Room.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.300
Well, They're Cleaner.
Men Are Pigs.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.700
But This Is Something
I Heard With My Own Eyes.

20:21.700 --> 20:23.900

What's Going On With Betty?

20:23.900 --> 20:25.200

20:57.100 --> 20:58.299
It's Nice To Meet You.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.499
Adult Braces. Wow.

21:00.500 --> 21:03.900
Oh, Yeah. Uh, You Probably
Didn't See Them In The Photo.

21:04.300 --> 21:06.200
I'm Glad
You Recognized Me.

21:06.500 --> 21:08.700
Um, Size 6, Please.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.100
An 11.

21:10.800 --> 21:14.100
Yeah, That Was
A Really Good Picture.

21:14.100 --> 21:17.400
I Know, It Was, Like,
My Best Ever.

21:50.550 --> 21:53.050
So I Fured,Why Even Bother With Ilovebunnies?

21:53.210 --> 21:57.050
Yeah,Why Bother? Lot Of Frames Left.

21:57.210 --> 21:59.340
Oh,You're Right. You're Right.

21:59.520 --> 22:02.050
But Just So You Know,That's How I Ended Up With Cuteinqueens.

22:02.230 --> 22:04.660
I Didn't Want You Thinking I Was Conceited,

22:04.840 --> 22:06.840
'Cause I'm Not.

22:08.610 --> 22:10.730
Oh,That's Me.

22:10.890 --> 22:12.700
Uh,Go Ahead. I'm Gonna Hit The Restroom.

22:12.860 --> 22:16.120
Oh,Okay,Uh,Funny Story About The Bathroom Here--

22:16.270 --> 22:17.660
A Little Gross, But Mostly Funny.

22:17.830 --> 22:19.670
I'll Tell You When You Get Back.

22:22.430 --> 22:22.950
Hello.

22:23.120 --> 22:24.080
So How's It Going?

22:24.250 --> 22:28.050
Good. He's A Really Nice Guy, Just Like His Screen Name Says.

22:28.230 --> 22:30.030
And We Haven't Had Any Of Those Awkward Pauses.

22:30.200 --> 22:31.640
Great. (Computer Beeps)

22:32.100 --> 22:32.720
Oh,I Have To Go.

22:32.880 --> 22:35.180
Someone's I.M.Ing Me On Bachelocity.

22:35.340 --> 22:37.830
Maybe I'll Get As Lucky As You Did. See You Later.

22:39.770 --> 22:41.340
You're not slngle.

22:43.070 --> 22:49.730
"And You Are A Creepy Stalker."

22:49.900 --> 22:52.309
No I'm not. I'm your husband.

23:26.320 --> 23:27.350
Look What I Swiped From The Closet

23:27.500 --> 23:29.310
For My Date With The Underwear Model.

23:29.470 --> 23:31.730
That's Right. I'm Seeing Gus Tonight. I Don't Believe You.

23:31.890 --> 23:32.660
It's True.

23:32.810 --> 23:36.160
I Want Proof. Ooh,Send Me A Dirty Cell Phone Picture.

23:36.310 --> 23:39.500
Oh,But Not Your Parts Again. That Was Gross.

23:39.670 --> 23:42.510
Yeah,Well, Your Left One's Bigger.

23:43.990 --> 23:44.920
Hey.

23:45.650 --> 23:46.920
You Got All Dressed Up.

23:47.100 --> 23:49.640
Mm. (Singsongy) New Cashmere.

23:49.810 --> 23:52.402
Old... Cat Hair.

23:53.710 --> 23:56.830
So Listen,After The Movie, Maybe We Can Go To The Village--

23:56.990 --> 23:59.850
Oh,Yeah,Right. Oh,I Meant To Call You.

24:00.020 --> 24:02.070
I'm Gonna Have To Take A Rain Check On "Psycho."

24:02.240 --> 24:04.220
You're Not Going To Believe This,

24:04.360 --> 24:06.310
But I Asked Out Gus.

24:06.460 --> 24:10.170
For... Tonight? Yeah, And He Said,"Yes."

24:10.340 --> 24:12.350
Aah! (Singsongy) I'm Going Out With An Underwear Model.

24:12.510 --> 24:13.730
(Normal Voice) Are You Dying? I'm Dying.

24:13.910 --> 24:17.000
Oh,Yeah,Yeah,I'm Dying. Uh,I Thought We Were Going Out.

24:17.170 --> 24:18.620
Yeah,But Gus And I Are Going On A <I>Date.</I>

24:18.780 --> 24:20.800
You And I Were Just Gonna...

24:22.330 --> 24:23.240
Oh.

24:23.400 --> 24:26.750
No. No "Oh." It-It-It's Fine.

24:26.920 --> 24:29.490
We Weren't... At All. Cliff...

24:29.660 --> 24:33.373
Okay,I've Gotta Go. Have Fun On Your Date.

24:41.830 --> 24:44.540
* You Can't Have Me

24:46.230 --> 24:50.220
* You Can't Keep Me For Yourse *

24:50.810 --> 24:51.290
* Not You...

24:51.470 --> 24:54.070
Yes,I Got One!

24:58.110 --> 24:59.130
Henry?

25:00.450 --> 25:04.490
Oh,My God,Betty. I Didn't See You.

25:04.660 --> 25:06.010
What Are You Doing Here?

25:06.330 --> 25:07.680
League Night.

25:07.840 --> 25:12.160
The Accountants Have A Team-- "The Debitz" With A "Z."

25:12.330 --> 25:14.850
Totally Intimidates "The Actuaries."

25:15.010 --> 25:16.270
What About You?

25:16.830 --> 25:18.810
Oh,Um,I'm On A Date.

25:18.980 --> 25:21.830
A First Date. It's Going Really Well.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.790
Actually, He'll Be Back Any Second.

25:23.960 --> 25:27.220
He--He Doesn't--He Didn't Have A-A Yellow Shirt On,Did He?

25:27.380 --> 25:28.610
Yeah,Yeah

25:28.780 --> 25:31.730
I-I've Been Calling Him "Yellow Head" All Night.

25:31.890 --> 25:35.690
We Just Laugh. Uh,How Did You Know?

25:35.850 --> 25:37.590
Well,I-I Think I Saw Him In The Bathroom,

25:37.760 --> 25:41.130
And He--He Got A Phone Call And Had To Leave.

25:41.290 --> 25:44.460
Oh,My God. Well,Do You Know Why?

25:45.110 --> 25:49.810
Well,I Think I Heard Him Say Something About A Pet Bird.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.870
It Was Sick. Bird Flu.

25:53.300 --> 25:55.870
Yeah,He Had To Rush And Say Good-Bye,

25:56.030 --> 25:58.160
And He--He Taught The Bird How To Say Good-Bye,

25:58.310 --> 25:59.350
And--You Know What? The Bird's Sick.

25:59.520 --> 26:01.620
Let's Just Leave It At That.

26:03.080 --> 26:06.390
Oh,Uh,Well, That's Too Bad.

26:06.570 --> 26:09.490
Um,Well,I Guess I'll Just Finish My Game On My Own.

26:09.660 --> 26:11.220
It Was Good To See You.

26:11.840 --> 26:13.130
Hey,You Know What?

26:13.320 --> 26:15.320
Um,I Was Thinking...

26:15.470 --> 26:17.980
Well,I Don't See Any Of The Other Debitz Here.

26:18.150 --> 26:20.610
Do You Mind If I Just Warmed Up In The Lane Next To You?

26:20.780 --> 26:22.890
Aren't We Supposed To Be Avoiding Each Other?

26:23.070 --> 26:25.740
Right. How's That Working For You?

26:25.900 --> 26:27.780
Not So Good. Same Here.

26:29.100 --> 26:31.840
Look,Why Don't We Just Try And Be Friends?

26:32.040 --> 26:35.640
Yeah. And In That Case, Friends Bowl,Right?

26:35.800 --> 26:36.220
Right.

26:36.390 --> 26:37.260
Yeah.

26:42.150 --> 26:43.740
I've Been Doing That All Night.

26:43.900 --> 26:45.240
Nice. (Laughs) (Laughs)

26:46.490 --> 26:47.860
<I>(Man) Okay,Lovers,</I>

26:48.030 --> 26:50.710
<I>It's The Time</I>  <I>You've All Been Waiting For.</I>

26:50.880 --> 26:53.018
<I>It's Couples' Bowl.</I>

26:55.760 --> 26:58.850
<I>(Woman) * Yeah,Yeah,Yeah </I>

27:00.430 --> 27:01.860
Bowling Sucks.

27:02.040 --> 27:03.470
Let's Go.

27:09.910 --> 27:11.280
Cliff,I Am So Sorry.

27:11.440 --> 27:12.670
Look,It's-- It's Not A Big Deal.

27:12.830 --> 27:13.980
It's Just-- Just A Misunderstanding.

27:14.150 --> 27:17.580
We--We Never Need To Talk About This Again.

27:21.950 --> 27:25.430
You Know What? We Are Gonna Talk About This Again.

27:25.800 --> 27:28.160
I Don't Know What Planet You're From,

27:28.310 --> 27:31.400
But When Someone Asks You Out For Drinks And A Movie,

27:31.560 --> 27:33.230
That's A Date, And The Only Reason

27:33.400 --> 27:34.830
You Didn't Think So Is 'Cause It Was Me.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.720
That's Not True. Oh,Come On.

27:36.880 --> 27:39.370
We Both Know That I Don't Have "Muscle Tone"

27:39.550 --> 27:42.590
Or--Or Use "Products," And For No Apparent Reason,

27:42.740 --> 27:44.110
I Now Do  Annoying "Air Quotes."

27:44.280 --> 27:45.290
Stop It.

27:45.460 --> 27:47.130
You're Such A Clich?

27:47.290 --> 27:49.530
You And Gus? What Is That?

27:49.690 --> 27:53.640
That's Beauty... And Beauty. That's Not A Story.

27:53.810 --> 27:56.950
Now "Beauty And The Beast"-- That's A Fairy Tale.

27:57.100 --> 27:59.050
I Am Not Dating Gus Just Because Of His Looks.

27:59.210 --> 28:00.600
We Had A Real Connection. We Laughed Together.

28:00.770 --> 28:02.980
<I>We</I> Laughed Together. Gus Just Stood There

28:03.140 --> 28:05.390
In His Backwards Underwear Lookin' Hot.

28:05.550 --> 28:06.200
So You Admit That He's Hot.

28:06.370 --> 28:10.380
Yes. Yes,He Is Hot. But I've Got News For You.

28:10.540 --> 28:14.050
In 20 Years,That Guy Candy Is Gonna Turn Into This.

28:14.200 --> 28:18.350
I Just Got There A Little Sooner.

28:23.500 --> 28:25.090
You Know Something,Marc?

28:25.240 --> 28:27.870
I Thought That There Was More To You.

28:28.880 --> 28:30.800
It's My Mistake.

28:39.210 --> 28:40.580
Alexis,Daniel.

28:40.740 --> 28:41.880
Dad.

28:44.160 --> 28:46.870
And This Is My Fianc蒃, Wilhelmina.

28:47.030 --> 28:49.340
I've Heard So Much About You.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.880
(Laughs) So When's The Last Time I Was Here?

28:52.040 --> 28:54.720
Oh,About A Month Ago, Before The Car Accident.

28:54.890 --> 28:58.080
We Had Dinner Together, As We Do Every Sunday.

28:58.250 --> 28:59.630
(Low Voice) Laying It On A Little Thick,Aren't We?

28:59.800 --> 29:01.910
May I Take Your Coat? Sure.

29:04.810 --> 29:06.130
You Okay?

29:06.890 --> 29:08.850
Yeah,Uh...

29:09.020 --> 29:12.420
I Thought I Just Had,Like, A Memory Flashback Or Something.

29:12.590 --> 29:14.750
Weird. Maybe I'm Just Hungry.

29:14.920 --> 29:15.970
Well,You're In Luck.

29:16.140 --> 29:18.310
Mommy Made Fondue.

29:26.250 --> 29:28.960
Now Everyone Put Your Hats On.

29:33.290 --> 29:34.590
I Am Not Putting That On.

29:34.760 --> 29:37.760
Bah Humbug,Daniel. We're All Together Tonight.

29:37.950 --> 29:40.500
It's A Perfect Time To Take Our Holiday Photo.

29:40.670 --> 29:43.500
Actually,We Usually Do It In Front Of The Christmas Tree

29:43.670 --> 29:44.800
With Our Real Mother. Come On.

29:44.980 --> 29:45.970
Daniel,I Would Never Try

29:46.140 --> 29:47.840
To Take The Place Of Your Real Mother.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.800
You'll Have Two Christmases This Year--One Here

29:49.980 --> 29:53.600
And One On The Lam. Here,Let Me Take That For You.

29:53.770 --> 29:56.600
Unless You Want To Continue In Your Mother's Tradition.

30:01.540 --> 30:02.990
Thanks,Dad.

30:03.170 --> 30:06.040
All Right, Everyone Smile.

30:14.390 --> 30:16.730
(Yoga Whispering) Hey,Fish.

30:17.310 --> 30:19.480
What The Hell Do You Think You're Doing?

30:19.630 --> 30:22.530
I Don't... I-I Don't Know.

30:23.170 --> 30:26.250
I-I Saw The Gun And... And The Wedding Invitation,

30:26.420 --> 30:29.130
And I Just Lost It.

30:30.660 --> 30:32.390
But Look.

30:33.150 --> 30:36.900
The Woman That Ruined My Life Did What I Never Could.

30:37.090 --> 30:39.070
She Brought Them Together.

30:39.230 --> 30:41.000
They're A Family.

30:43.010 --> 30:45.020
That's All I Ever Wanted.

30:46.540 --> 30:48.330
It's Okay Now.

30:50.410 --> 30:52.370
Let's Go To Italy.

31:02.110 --> 31:04.790
(Hilda) I Gotta Say, This Is Very Relaxing.

31:05.120 --> 31:07.950
It Really Does Pass The Time.

31:08.120 --> 31:09.120
You Know What Else Was Nice?

31:09.290 --> 31:10.350
The Applesauce That We Had For Dinner.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.810
I Think I Could Have It Every Day. (Laughs)

31:12.980 --> 31:16.080
They're Sleeping, Grandma.

31:17.050 --> 31:19.150
For Her,It Could Be The Big One.

31:19.330 --> 31:20.890
<I>Ay,Papi.</I>

31:32.510 --> 31:34.320
It's Not Much, But It's There. (Siren Whoops)

31:35.300 --> 31:38.110
Who Died? I Get Her Clothes.

31:38.260 --> 31:40.450
I'll Get It.

31:46.130 --> 31:47.110
Justin.

31:47.270 --> 31:49.660
Hey,Hilda. Listen,Justin Took Your Car

31:49.840 --> 31:51.990
For A Little Joyride With His Friends.

31:52.150 --> 31:53.640
What?

31:53.810 --> 31:55.600
I'm Goin' Upstairs.

31:55.810 --> 31:58.050
Hey. He Crashed It Into A Tree.

31:58.590 --> 31:59.470
No One Was Hurt

31:59.660 --> 32:02.760
Except The Car And The Tree.

32:03.060 --> 32:04.870
Listen,This One's Between Us.

32:05.040 --> 32:06.160
I Know You Been Goin' Through A Lot Lately,

32:06.320 --> 32:07.600
But Keep An Eye On Him.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.610
I Seen These Things Spiral.

32:09.790 --> 32:12.650
Yeah,Yeah. Thanks,Rita.

32:12.810 --> 32:14.040
Mm-Hmm.

32:14.510 --> 32:16.360
Thanks.

32:23.500 --> 32:24.210
All Right,Ladies.

32:24.370 --> 32:26.350
Looks Like We're Gonna Have To Wrap Things Up.

32:26.500 --> 32:28.860
You Don't Have To Go Home, But You Can't Quilt Here.

32:29.030 --> 32:31.130
Will We See You Tomorrow?

32:31.310 --> 32:34.830
I Don't Think So. I Mean,This Was Fun,

32:34.990 --> 32:36.880
But Maybe I'll Just See You At The Cemetery.

32:37.050 --> 32:38.460
I Mean,Above Ground. (Women Laugh)

32:39.710 --> 32:42.310
So Who's Got The Walker? Yeah,Let's Help.

32:42.780 --> 32:45.520
Well,Dinner Is Served.

32:45.850 --> 32:46.630
Come On.

32:46.800 --> 32:48.640
Soup's Not Soup Unless It's Hot.

32:49.350 --> 32:51.900
Wait,Dad,There's Something I Have To Tell You.

32:52.070 --> 32:52.950
It's About The Magazine.

32:53.120 --> 32:55.610
No,Alexis. I Can't Let You Do That.

32:55.780 --> 32:58.950
Hot Or Cold, Soup Is Soup.

33:03.300 --> 33:05.590
I Lost Atlantic Attire,

33:05.760 --> 33:08.860
Which Led To A Substantial Advertiser Pullout.

33:09.010 --> 33:10.420
How Substantial?

33:10.580 --> 33:11.970
52%, But I Can Explain.

33:12.150 --> 33:14.800
Of All The Incompetent-- Hold On,Dad. It's Not His Fault.

33:14.950 --> 33:17.460
He Was Protecting Me. Don't Defend Him.

33:17.640 --> 33:20.670
Your Brother Has A Long History Of Making Mistakes Around Here

33:20.840 --> 33:23.440
And Expecting Everybody Else To Clean Up After Him.

33:23.610 --> 33:26.000
You're The Only One I Can Count On To Do Anything Right.

33:26.160 --> 33:27.540
And Me,Of Course.

33:27.710 --> 33:30.520
Look,I Can Fix This. Just Give Me The Chance.

33:30.820 --> 33:31.220
(Bradford,Voice Distorted) I Always Knew

33:31.390 --> 33:33.310
Something Like This Wagonna Happen.

33:33.480 --> 33:36.550
You've Had Every Opportunity Handed To You.

33:36.720 --> 33:39.860
How The Hell Could You Turn Into Such A Screwup?

33:40.920 --> 33:43.750
<I>You Are Dead To Me,Alex.</I>

33:46.410 --> 33:48.850
Excuse Me.

33:57.360 --> 34:00.490
Oh,Boy,It Really Is Date Night.

34:01.540 --> 34:02.880
Who Cares?

34:03.030 --> 34:04.340
Two Friends Can Have Dinner,Right?

34:04.510 --> 34:05.360
No Big Deal.

34:05.520 --> 34:06.680
Yeah.

34:08.530 --> 34:09.870
What Are You Doing?

34:10.170 --> 34:12.620
Oh,Oh, This Is For Me.

34:12.780 --> 34:14.639
Sucks To Be You.

34:14.810 --> 34:16.480
No,Seriously, Do You Want To Sit Here?

34:16.650 --> 34:19.040
No,I'm Fine.

34:20.639 --> 34:21.780
Thank You.

34:22.420 --> 34:23.800
Thank You.

34:24.600 --> 34:27.110
Oh,Look, It's My Date's Bird.

34:27.280 --> 34:29.260
Guess He Didn't Make It.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.610
I'm Sorry. I'm A Terrible Liar.

34:31.770 --> 34:33.520
????

34:33.690 --> 34:35.710
And You're On A Bowling Team Called The Debitz?

34:35.870 --> 34:39.610
No,The Debitz Are Real. It Just Wasn't League Night. Oh.

34:40.540 --> 34:44.010
I-I Heard You Were On A Date, And It Made Me Kind Of Crazy.

34:44.170 --> 34:46.989
Are You Serious? You Got Jealous?

34:47.170 --> 34:48.550
Oh,No,No,No. We Are Not...

34:48.719 --> 34:52.270
We're Friends. He Got Another Girl Pregnant.

34:52.610 --> 34:56.070
Betty. What? I Can Deal With It. I'm Sure Hcan.

34:56.219 --> 34:57.150
Rose For Your Pretty Lady?

34:57.330 --> 34:59.350
Oh,No,She's Not My Pretty Lady.

34:59.530 --> 35:02.360
I Mean,She's Pretty, Uh,But...

35:02.550 --> 35:04.710
He Got Another Girl Pregnant. Oh.

35:08.020 --> 35:08.910
Oh.

35:10.540 --> 35:14.110
You Know What? Suddenly I'm Not So Hungry.

35:14.400 --> 35:15.900
Wait,Betty,Wait.

35:16.060 --> 35:19.020
No,We Can Do This. You Mean So Much To Me.

35:19.190 --> 35:21.470
Oh,My God, He's Proposing!

35:21.640 --> 35:22.510
What? What? No,No.

35:22.700 --> 35:25.880
(Man) Champagne For The Happy Couple. No,No. No,No,I'm Not.

35:26.040 --> 35:29.830
Wait. I Would,But...

35:29.990 --> 35:32.450
I Can't Do This.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.110
No,Uh...

35:43.300 --> 35:44.480
You Okay?

35:44.660 --> 35:46.140
Where Are Ey?

35:46.510 --> 35:47.740
Down In The Kitchen.

35:47.910 --> 35:50.750
She's Licking Fondue Cheese Off His Fingers.

35:51.940 --> 35:53.230
What's Wrong?

35:54.490 --> 35:56.210
I Remember Everything.

35:56.380 --> 35:57.990
Dad's Been Lying To Me This Whole Time,

35:58.170 --> 36:00.180
Acting Like Some Loving Father.

36:00.340 --> 36:01.210
He Hates Me.

36:01.380 --> 36:03.970
No,He Doesn't. He Just Wanted To Use The Accident

36:04.150 --> 36:06.050
As A Way To Start Over With You.

36:06.220 --> 36:09.960
I Remember The Accident,Too. It Wasn't Your Fault.

36:10.280 --> 36:11.480
What?

36:13.230 --> 36:15.670
We Took Dad's Car, And I Had...

36:15.820 --> 36:17.820
I'd--I'd Paid Someone To,Um...

36:19.210 --> 36:21.320
To Cut The Brakes.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.820
What? No,You Didn't.

36:23.990 --> 36:25.560
Yes,I Did.

36:25.730 --> 36:29.150
He Was Trying To Get Rid Of Me, And So I Was Trying To...

36:29.310 --> 36:31.290
What? Kill Him?

36:31.470 --> 36:33.810
Oh,God. Alexis,What The Hell Is Wrong With You?

36:33.980 --> 36:37.450
I Was Torturing Myself. I Thought <I>I</I> Put You In A Coma.

36:37.620 --> 36:40.110
All This Time You Wanted To Murder Our Father?

36:40.260 --> 36:41.950
Daniel,I'm Sorry.

36:42.120 --> 36:44.760
Please Don't Tell Him.

36:48.320 --> 36:50.410
Wouldn't Believe Me Anyway.

37:00.590 --> 37:03.680
So You Had A Big Day,Huh?

37:03.840 --> 37:06.800
Stealing A Car, Crashing A Car.

37:08.010 --> 37:10.530
I Think We Should Talk About It.

37:14.240 --> 37:15.140
Are You Serious?

37:15.300 --> 37:17.340
Yeah,I Know You Think I Haven't Been Paying Attention

37:17.500 --> 37:19.410
To What's Been Going On Lately,

37:19.580 --> 37:21.830
And Maybe I Haven't, But That's Gonna Change.

37:22.010 --> 37:25.900
Oh,So Now You're Gonna Turn Back Into A Mother?

37:26.250 --> 37:27.750
What's That Supposed To Mean?

37:27.910 --> 37:30.680
It's Not Exactly A Part-Time Job When You Feel Like It.

37:30.840 --> 37:32.290
Oh,No, Get The Hell Back Here.

37:32.470 --> 37:33.880
I <I>Am</I> Your Mother. Don't You Forget It.

37:34.040 --> 37:36.710
Let Go Of Me. No,Justin,Listen.

37:36.870 --> 37:37.840
A Kid Losing His Father--

37:38.010 --> 37:41.440
That Is Not Supposed To Happen.

37:43.360 --> 37:46.240
And I Would Do Anything-- Anything In The World

37:46.400 --> 37:49.080
If I Could Bring Him Back.

37:49.740 --> 37:54.300
But... It's Just You And Me.

37:54.930 --> 37:57.250
We're All We've Got.

37:57.880 --> 37:59.690
And I'm Getting Scared, Justin,

37:59.850 --> 38:04.810
Because I Feel Like We're-- We're Moving Like This.

38:08.810 --> 38:12.850
So I Think It's Time We Pull It Together,Yeah?

38:13.010 --> 38:14.430
I Mean,I Been Acting Like An 80 Year Old,

38:14.590 --> 38:17.250
And You With The... With The Attitude

38:17.410 --> 38:19.610
And The Clothes--

38:19.900 --> 38:21.730
That's Not You.

38:22.590 --> 38:25.230
I Just Wanted Him To Be Proud Of Me.

38:25.500 --> 38:28.230
Oh,Baby,He Was Proud Of You.

38:28.390 --> 38:29.610
He <I>Is.</I>

38:29.770 --> 38:33.420
Just Exactly, Exactly Like You Are.

38:36.430 --> 38:38.070
I Just Miss Him So Much.

38:38.240 --> 38:40.470
Oh,Me,Too.

38:42.390 --> 38:44.460
But It's Gonna Be Okay.

38:45.280 --> 38:47.420
Just Let It Out.

38:48.660 --> 38:51.210
We're Gonna Be Okay.

38:55.640 --> 38:56.670
Oh.

39:02.020 --> 39:04.310
If You Had Told Me When I Woke Up This Morning,

39:04.470 --> 39:07.410
That I Would End Up At Your Apartment,

39:07.570 --> 39:09.990
I Woulnot Have Believed You.

39:11.890 --> 39:13.860
Will You Stop Grinning?

39:14.040 --> 39:15.100
You Picked Me.

39:15.280 --> 39:18.680
I Didn't Pick You. I Just Wanted To See "Psycho."

39:18.830 --> 39:21.690
* You Picked Me Over An Underwear Model *

39:21.840 --> 39:23.020
What Is That?

39:23.440 --> 39:25.650
That--That Is A Dance You're Never Gonna See Again.

39:25.820 --> 39:27.460
Exactly.

39:36.600 --> 39:40.850
So What If I Get Scared?

39:41.630 --> 39:43.460
Well...

39:43.890 --> 39:46.290
Then I'll Be Right Here Next To You.

39:59.220 --> 40:01.070
What? (Henry) I Need To Talk To You.

40:01.230 --> 40:03.870
Why? What Could There Possibly Be Left To Say?

40:04.050 --> 40:06.260
I Just Don't Want Things To End Like This.

40:06.420 --> 40:08.630
So You Had To Follow Me All The Way Home?

40:08.800 --> 40:11.070
No,I Followed You Because I Didn't Want You

40:11.210 --> 40:13.670
Walking Alone At Night.

40:18.400 --> 40:19.890
Henry,Please.

40:20.050 --> 40:21.650
Stop. Stop Being So Nice.

40:21.820 --> 40:23.600
You're Not Making This Any Easier.

40:23.770 --> 40:25.130
Well,What Am I Supposed To Do?

40:25.280 --> 40:26.850
I Don't Know.

40:27.010 --> 40:29.410
Kick A Puppy Or Knock Over A Midget.

40:29.590 --> 40:31.310
I-I Think The More Considerate Term

40:31.480 --> 40:33.390
Is "Little Person"?

40:33.570 --> 40:36.070
No. See? This Is Exactly What I'm Talking About.

40:36.230 --> 40:37.810
Well,I Don't Know What To Do.

40:37.970 --> 40:39.040
We Said We Were Gonna Avoid Each Other

40:39.210 --> 40:40.070
And That Didn't Work.

40:40.220 --> 40:42.060
Being Friends Practically Got Us Married.

40:42.220 --> 40:45.200
So What's Left? Should I Leave "Mode"?

40:50.530 --> 40:52.680
Okay.

40:54.860 --> 40:57.380
I'll--I'll Give My Notice On Monday.

40:58.610 --> 41:00.250
Daniel Can Help You Find Something.

41:00.420 --> 41:01.650
Yeah.

41:07.500 --> 41:09.670
Good-Bye,Henry.

41:12.010 --> 41:13.450
Good-Bye,Betty.

41:26.950 --> 41:28.520
There Is Another Option.

41:28.690 --> 41:30.280
There Is?

41:37.570 --> 41:40.580
(Man) * You Must Remember This

41:40.730 --> 41:43.690
I Know You're Leaving In Five Months,

41:43.960 --> 41:46.330
And I Know Everyone's Gonna Say It's A Big Mistake,

41:46.490 --> 41:50.500
And I Know That I'm Gonna Get My Heart Broken,

41:51.670 --> 41:53.660
But Maybe It's Worth It.

41:54.250 --> 41:56.110
Are You Sure?

41:57.590 --> 42:00.680
* It's Still The Same Old Story *

42:00.850 --> 42:03.110
* A Fight For Love And Glory *

42:03.270 --> 42:07.360
* A Case Of Do Or Die
