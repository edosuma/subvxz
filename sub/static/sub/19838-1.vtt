00:04.220 --> 00:07.480
<b>I'm the pro Hunter Biscuit Krueger.</b>

00:07.480 --> 00:09.460
<b>I'm not big on formalities,</b>

00:09.460 --> 00:11.490
<b>so call me Bisky.</b>

00:11.970 --> 00:16.470
<b>In return, you must obey every 
word of what I teach you.</b>

00:16.470 --> 00:18.740
<b>No way. And no, thanks.</b>

00:19.310 --> 00:24.480
<b>We're not desperate enough to beg 
a total stranger to train us!</b>

00:24.480 --> 00:26.480
<b>Say something, Gon.</b>

00:26.480 --> 00:28.750
<b>We have Wing-san.</b>

00:28.750 --> 00:30.000
<b>Right, right.</b>

00:30.490 --> 00:32.850
<b>We already have a master,</b>

00:32.850 --> 00:35.010
<b>and we don't need anyone else to teach us.</b>

00:35.310 --> 00:36.590
<b>Wing?</b>

00:36.590 --> 00:39.270
<b>You mean that little boy with 
messy hair and glasses?</b>

00:40.090 --> 00:42.320
<b>The one who never tucks in his shirt?</b>

00:42.320 --> 00:43.640
<b>Do you know him?</b>

00:44.040 --> 00:45.330
<b>Do I know him?</b>

00:45.330 --> 00:48.150
<b>Wing's one of my students.</b>

00:48.150 --> 00:49.180
<b><i>Seriously?</i></b>

00:49.180 --> 00:51.150
<b>That's awesome!</b>

00:51.430 --> 00:53.980
<b>So he's become a master now...</b>

00:53.980 --> 00:56.440
<b>Time really flies, huh?</b>

00:56.440 --> 00:59.450
<b>Does that mean you're pro Hunters?</b>

00:59.450 --> 01:01.160
<b>Oh, just me.</b>

01:01.790 --> 01:04.030
<b>You've passed the secret exam?</b>

01:04.030 --> 01:05.040
<b>Yep.</b>

01:05.440 --> 01:07.560
<b>That really takes me back...</b>

01:08.210 --> 01:11.050
<b><i>I'd love to serve as an examiner again.</i></b>

01:12.170 --> 01:16.180
<b>Well, I'm essentially your master's master,</b>

01:16.740 --> 01:19.340
<b>so you shouldn't have any 
problems with my teaching you.</b>

02:40.010 --> 02:45.060
<b>A x Hard x Master</b>

02:45.560 --> 02:46.770
<b>Wow!</b>

02:46.770 --> 02:49.480
<b>You've been an examiner!</b>

02:49.480 --> 02:51.690
<b>Assuming that she's telling the truth.</b>

02:52.680 --> 02:55.330
<b>You're a stubborn little boy.</b>

02:55.330 --> 02:57.440
<b>I like to see that in kids.</b>

02:57.810 --> 03:01.270
<b>You said that you weren't desperate, right?</b>

03:01.870 --> 03:02.800
<b><i>Book.</i></b>

03:03.560 --> 03:04.580
<b>That card...</b>

03:04.580 --> 03:11.580
<b>Marimo-chi 

A super-fast ball-like 
creature about as hard 
as rubber. Deals little 
damage, but can be 
annoying if it smacks 
you in the face.</b>

03:04.740 --> 03:06.050
<b>Look carefully.</b>

03:06.050 --> 03:07.800
<b>Its difficulty to obtain is ranked D.</b>

03:07.800 --> 03:11.580
<b>It's a normal card that doesn't 
go in a restricted slot.</b>

03:13.180 --> 03:14.330
<b>The problem is that</b>

03:14.330 --> 03:16.900
<b>there are many people who 
could have effortlessly</b>

03:16.900 --> 03:21.090
<b>obtained this card, while you two could not.</b>

03:21.530 --> 03:26.850
<b>If you run into someone who's 
stronger and has evil intentions...</b>

03:29.450 --> 03:31.850
<b>Sit down... 
Pretend that we're chatting.</b>

03:33.030 --> 03:35.110
<b>There's an enemy behind me.</b>

03:38.550 --> 03:40.420
<b>Three kids?</b>

03:45.660 --> 03:47.700
<b>I'll cut them apart.</b>

03:50.470 --> 03:52.460
<b>Don't probe for him.</b>

03:52.770 --> 03:54.330
<b>He'll notice.</b>

03:54.330 --> 03:55.830
<b>How did you sense him?</b>

03:56.090 --> 03:58.340
<b>He let a tiny bit of bloodlust escape.</b>

03:58.340 --> 04:02.590
<b>The enemy saw a bunch of kids, 
and he relaxed for a second.</b>

04:03.020 --> 04:05.090
<b>Doesn't that mean he's weak?</b>

04:05.440 --> 04:08.660
<b>He immediately concealed his presence again.</b>

04:09.340 --> 04:11.980
<b>It was only the slightest bloodlust, 
and he quickly concealed it,</b>

04:12.460 --> 04:14.600
<b>so he's pretty good.</b>

04:14.920 --> 04:19.810
<b><i>We couldn't even sense his presence, 
let alone locate him.</i></b>

04:21.130 --> 04:22.360
<b>What should we do?</b>

04:22.550 --> 04:24.590
<b><i>He's fast on the uptake!</i></b>

04:24.590 --> 04:26.120
<b><i>This boy's bright.</i></b>

04:27.000 --> 04:28.720
<b>What do you think?</b>

04:28.720 --> 04:30.800
<b>We three should move together.</b>

04:30.800 --> 04:32.220
<b>Why do you say that?</b>

04:32.220 --> 04:34.470
<b>I'm guessing he decided to use caution</b>

04:34.470 --> 04:36.630
<b>because there are three of us.</b>

04:37.110 --> 04:41.210
<b>If we stick together, 
he'll be less eager to attack.</b>

04:41.210 --> 04:42.380
<b>I agree.</b>

04:42.640 --> 04:45.130
<b>Well, you're right.</b>

04:45.660 --> 04:47.820
<b>But that's not what we're going to do.</b>

04:48.420 --> 04:49.950
<b>If I go off on my own,</b>

04:49.950 --> 04:52.840
<b>the enemy is one hundred percent 
guaranteed to attack me.</b>

04:52.840 --> 04:54.790
<b>I'll go south. You boys, go north.</b>

04:55.250 --> 04:58.770
<b>Walk five hundred meters without 
concealing your presences.</b>

04:59.490 --> 05:01.460
<b>Aim for that pillar.</b>

05:01.460 --> 05:04.650
<b>Once you get there, use <i>Zetsu</i>, 
then rush back immediately!</b>

05:04.900 --> 05:06.660
<b>Okay, stalk the stalkerâ€”</b>

05:11.420 --> 05:12.620
<b>Huh?</b>

05:12.950 --> 05:15.270
<b>Fine, then! Be that way!</b>

05:15.270 --> 05:17.620
<b><i>Damned hag...</i></b>

05:17.790 --> 05:19.910
<b>I've had enough!</b>

05:19.910 --> 05:21.100
<b>Bye-bye.</b>

05:21.100 --> 05:22.550
<b>Yeah, get lost!</b>

05:22.550 --> 05:24.150
<b>We didn't want you around!</b>

05:24.150 --> 05:25.130
<b>Come on, Gon!</b>

05:25.130 --> 05:26.100
<b>Let's go.</b>

05:27.070 --> 05:29.140
<b><i>Oh, they're acting.</i></b>

05:29.890 --> 05:32.560
<b>So long, stupid!</b>

05:37.740 --> 05:40.160
<b>That woman really is something.</b>

05:40.160 --> 05:40.770
<b>Huh?</b>

05:41.220 --> 05:43.040
<b>I was on full alert,</b>

05:43.040 --> 05:45.030
<b>so I'd be ready to react at a moment's notice.</b>

05:46.120 --> 05:49.120
<b>But I didn't realize what she'd done</b>

05:49.120 --> 05:51.160
<b>until my cheek began to sting.</b>

05:59.190 --> 06:00.440
<b>Let's hurry back.</b>

06:00.440 --> 06:01.040
<b>Yeah.</b>

06:10.090 --> 06:13.680
<b>I just cut your hair...</b>

06:14.270 --> 06:20.100
<b>With my Scissor Hands!</b>

06:21.660 --> 06:28.660
<b>When I eat the hair I cut,</b>

06:29.830 --> 06:32.350
<b>I can learn things about the owner's body</b>

06:32.350 --> 06:36.020
<b>that they don't even know about themselves.</b>

06:36.830 --> 06:41.800
<b>Muscle tone, potential for 
disease, genetic strengths!</b>

06:43.370 --> 06:46.210
<b>I will learn everything about your body</b>

06:46.210 --> 06:47.970
<b>before I begin to toy with it...</b>

06:54.380 --> 06:57.300
<b><i>Age fifty-seven?!</i></b>

06:57.810 --> 06:59.190
<b><i>And she looks like this?</i></b>

06:59.750 --> 07:03.690
<b><i>What's even scarier is how honed her body is.</i></b>

07:05.260 --> 07:06.440
<b><i>I can see</i></b>

07:07.060 --> 07:08.440
<b><i>her physical appearance conceals</i></b>

07:09.190 --> 07:12.200
<b><i>the strength she's achieved</i></b>

07:12.700 --> 07:14.700
<b><i>through intensive training.</i></b>

07:18.050 --> 07:20.830
<b>My fighter's spirit insists that 
I challenge you to a duel.</b>

07:21.160 --> 07:23.630
<b>I guess you aren't a total deviant.</b>

07:24.960 --> 07:26.210
<b>Very well.</b>

07:56.530 --> 07:57.620
<b>You're lucky.</b>

07:58.150 --> 08:01.280
<b>If I'd used my <i>Nen</i>, you would be dead.</b>

08:02.000 --> 08:04.750
<b>During that battle, what did you see first?</b>

08:04.750 --> 08:08.160
<b>The guy being flipped through the air.</b>

08:08.160 --> 08:09.380
<b>Same here.</b>

08:09.600 --> 08:11.630
<b><i>Her opponent wasn't weak by any means.</i></b>

08:11.940 --> 08:14.130
<b><i>She's just that strong!</i></b>

08:14.570 --> 08:16.800
<b>If he were an in-game character,</b>

08:16.800 --> 08:18.640
<b>he'd have a D rank in terms of difficulty.</b>

08:19.030 --> 08:22.140
<b>It would have been an instant 
game over for you boys.</b>

08:22.660 --> 08:24.780
<b>That makes the second time</b>

08:24.780 --> 08:27.590
<b>I've seen you barely escape death.</b>

08:28.220 --> 08:30.590
<b>How long will your good fortune last?</b>

08:31.110 --> 08:32.280
<b>Bisky-san...</b>

08:32.620 --> 08:34.500
<b>Just call me Bisky.</b>

08:34.500 --> 08:36.990
<b>If you insist on an honorific,</b>

08:36.990 --> 08:38.870
<b>call me Bisky-chama!</b>

08:38.870 --> 08:40.790
<b>I'll just call you Hag.</b>

08:43.790 --> 08:46.290
<b>Why are you here, Bisky?</b>

08:46.290 --> 08:49.090
<b>Well, I'm here to clear the game,</b>

08:49.090 --> 08:51.010
<b>but I'm mainly after a jewel.</b>

08:51.010 --> 08:51.920
<b>A jewel?</b>

08:52.240 --> 08:55.220
<b>There's a jewel that can only be found here.</b>

08:55.200 --> 09:00.810
<b>Blue Planet 

A gemstone with an 
incomparable blue shine. 
Its composition matches 
no known minerals, 
so it's named for its 
otherworldly nature.</b>

08:55.220 --> 08:57.670
<b>It goes in restricted slot #81...</b>

08:57.670 --> 08:59.300
<b>Blue Planet.</b>

08:59.680 --> 09:00.810
<b>What about you boys?</b>

09:01.460 --> 09:04.660
<b>We're here to clear the game, obviously.</b>

09:04.660 --> 09:08.130
<b>Actually, my dad made this game.</b>

09:08.130 --> 09:09.320
<b>Oh?</b>

09:09.730 --> 09:12.460
<b>I'm looking for my dad,</b>

09:12.460 --> 09:16.140
<b>so I thought this game might contain a lead.</b>

09:16.140 --> 09:18.180
<b>Who's your dad?</b>

09:18.180 --> 09:19.330
<b>Ging Freecss.</b>

09:19.640 --> 09:20.720
<b>Ging?!</b>

09:20.720 --> 09:21.730
<b>You know him?</b>

09:21.730 --> 09:23.080
<b>You bet I do!</b>

09:23.080 --> 09:24.970
<b>He's famous.</b>

09:28.180 --> 09:30.050
<b>Chairman Netero once said</b>

09:30.050 --> 09:33.840
<b>he was one of the top five <i>Nen</i> users...</b>

09:38.170 --> 09:43.340
<b>Bisky, if you'd be willing to 
postpone your treasure hunt,</b>

09:43.340 --> 09:45.600
<b>please teach us <i>Nen</i>!</b>

09:45.930 --> 09:47.900
<b>You've finally come around?</b>

09:48.350 --> 09:50.980
<b>I'm a lot tougher than Wing.</b>

09:51.390 --> 09:52.820
<b>Are you ready?</b>

09:52.820 --> 09:53.780
<b>Yes!</b>

09:53.780 --> 09:55.040
<b>What about you?</b>

09:55.040 --> 09:56.180
<b>I'll be fine.</b>

09:59.540 --> 10:01.250
<b>Take out all your cards.</b>

10:01.820 --> 10:03.230
<b><i>Book.</i></b>

10:06.090 --> 10:07.250
<b>I'm going to give you a chance.</b>

10:07.710 --> 10:11.250
<b>You must evade their attacks for two weeks!</b>

10:11.640 --> 10:13.910
<b>If you're successful, I'll let you escape.</b>

10:13.910 --> 10:17.630
<b>If you're knocked unconscious or can't stand...</b>

10:18.060 --> 10:19.610
<b>I will kill you.</b>

10:21.760 --> 10:24.410
<b>I just have to avoid their attacks, right?</b>

10:25.190 --> 10:27.160
<b>It doesn't matter what I do to them?</b>

10:28.180 --> 10:29.270
<b>Sure.</b>

10:29.540 --> 10:31.180
<b>But there's one rule.</b>

10:31.180 --> 10:34.620
<b>You aren't allowed to leave this crater.</b>

10:34.620 --> 10:36.140
<b>If you break this rule, you lose,</b>

10:36.140 --> 10:38.600
<b>and I'll kill you.</b>

10:38.600 --> 10:39.780
<b>What about us?</b>

10:40.050 --> 10:42.140
<b>The same rules apply.</b>

10:42.140 --> 10:45.040
<b>If you leave, or fail to defeat 
him after two weeks,</b>

10:45.040 --> 10:46.710
<b>you'll be punished.</b>

10:48.160 --> 10:51.020
<b>You're the Bounty Hunter Binolt, right?</b>

10:51.680 --> 10:52.820
<b>Yeah.</b>

10:53.270 --> 10:55.050
<b>There's a bounty on his head, as well.</b>

10:55.700 --> 10:57.510
<b>He's a brutal murderer.</b>

11:01.910 --> 11:03.040
<b>Begin!</b>

11:20.970 --> 11:22.790
<b>Why are you standing around?</b>

11:22.790 --> 11:24.430
<b>He's trying to heal up!</b>

11:24.430 --> 11:26.130
<b>Are you going to let him?</b>

11:33.470 --> 11:35.800
<b><i>If he weren't injured,</i></b>

11:35.800 --> 11:37.210
<b><i>I would have lost my eye!</i></b>

11:43.590 --> 11:45.550
<b><i>We can't get close to him...</i></b>

11:47.120 --> 11:48.390
<b><i>Should I use this?</i></b>

11:48.390 --> 11:53.560
<b><i>But while I charge up, he won't stay still.</i></b>

11:54.050 --> 11:56.390
<b>Gon, let's make this a battle of attrition.</b>

11:56.390 --> 11:57.690
<b>Attrition?</b>

11:58.080 --> 11:59.670
<b>You get some rest.</b>

11:59.670 --> 12:03.310
<b>I'll keep an eye on him, and use these to attack.</b>

12:03.310 --> 12:04.950
<b>We'll switch every six hours.</b>

12:05.320 --> 12:06.620
<b>Rocks?</b>

12:06.620 --> 12:08.050
<b>That's a good idea.</b>

12:09.890 --> 12:11.490
<b><i>That's exactly what I need...</i></b>

12:11.490 --> 12:14.890
<b><i>If I can rest like this for a week, 
I'll be more or less recovered.</i></b>

12:15.360 --> 12:18.460
<b><i>Once I'm healed, I can finish them off.</i></b>

12:36.090 --> 12:37.690
<b><i>He's using the rock as a shield!</i></b>

12:40.670 --> 12:41.800
<b>Correct!</b>

12:41.800 --> 12:44.570
<b>You boys can't beat him in a drawn-out fight.</b>

12:44.940 --> 12:46.160
<b>Makes sense.</b>

12:48.540 --> 12:49.650
<b>Damn!</b>

13:16.730 --> 13:18.470
<b><i>They have too much stamina!</i></b>

13:18.470 --> 13:20.190
<b><i>I won't have any time to rest!</i></b>

13:20.780 --> 13:22.900
<b><i>Binolt may be injured,</i></b>

13:22.900 --> 13:25.590
<b><i>but making him uncomfortable 
in half a day is still impressive.</i></b>

13:25.590 --> 13:29.200
<b><i>They're conscious that their lives 
are on the line in this fight.</i></b>

13:29.730 --> 13:30.870
<b><i>Not bad at all.</i></b>

13:32.160 --> 13:34.930
<b><i>These boys are raw gems!</i></b>

13:36.360 --> 13:38.290
<b><i>That rock-hard conviction in his eyes.</i></b>

13:38.290 --> 13:41.710
<b><i>That hidden, bottomless potential.</i></b>

13:42.060 --> 13:46.310
<b><i>If properly cut through training, 
he can be completely transformed...</i></b>

13:47.300 --> 13:49.330
<b><i>Like a diamond!</i></b>

13:50.440 --> 13:52.180
<b><i>And this boy is a cool, calm blue.</i></b>

13:52.180 --> 13:54.340
<b><i>He may look fragile,</i></b>

13:54.340 --> 13:57.930
<b><i>but with the right amount of heat, he can 
achieve semi-permanent strength...</i></b>

13:59.070 --> 14:01.110
<b><i>Like a sapphire!</i></b>

14:02.240 --> 14:03.960
<b><i>Why does my heart skip</i></b>

14:03.960 --> 14:07.200
<b><i>whenever I see something 
waiting to be polished?</i></b>

14:07.200 --> 14:09.990
<b><i>I'll train them well!</i></b>

14:12.310 --> 14:13.530
<b><i>What?</i></b>

14:14.550 --> 14:16.350
<b><i>A forest of rocks.</i></b>

14:16.350 --> 14:19.530
<b><i>It impedes their enemy, 
while concealing their presences.</i></b>

14:20.070 --> 14:24.000
<b><i>This won't take two weeks. 
They'll finish it in a day.</i></b>

14:38.990 --> 14:41.230
<b>Game over, pops!</b>

14:41.230 --> 14:42.690
<b>Stop, Killua!</b>

14:45.960 --> 14:47.990
<b>Why did you stop me, Gon?</b>

14:47.990 --> 14:49.890
<b>We still have plenty of time.</b>

14:49.890 --> 14:52.860
<b>Let's continue until we're both 
able to take him alone.</b>

14:52.860 --> 14:53.830
<b>Huh?</b>

14:54.190 --> 14:56.340
<b>Stopping now would be a waste.</b>

14:56.340 --> 14:58.580
<b>Because we're on a roll.</b>

14:59.460 --> 15:00.590
<b>Fool...</b>

15:01.660 --> 15:03.000
<b>It's my turn.</b>

15:03.000 --> 15:04.840
<b>I'll slice you up!</b>

15:05.110 --> 15:07.720
<b>Sure, but let's wait until tomorrow.</b>

15:08.500 --> 15:11.060
<b>You should get some rest.</b>

15:11.060 --> 15:13.350
<b>You've been slowing down.</b>

15:14.610 --> 15:15.590
<b><i>True.</i></b>

15:16.140 --> 15:20.170
<b><i>If it takes both of us to beat a single 
injured, exhausted man,</i></b>

15:20.170 --> 15:22.730
<b><i>we won't stand a chance 
against any of the rest.</i></b>

15:34.300 --> 15:39.470
<b>You won't be able to fool their 
acute antennae now.</b>

15:40.190 --> 15:44.580
<b>Binolt, your potential pales 
in comparison to theirs.</b>

15:55.340 --> 15:56.760
<b><i>Oh, my wallet's missing.</i></b>

15:57.000 --> 15:59.520
<b><i>Really? You had it a moment ago.</i></b>

16:01.790 --> 16:02.770
<b><i>Excuse me...</i></b>

16:04.680 --> 16:07.520
<b><i>You dropped this...</i></b>

16:17.400 --> 16:20.040
<b>Day two...</b>

16:35.870 --> 16:37.700
<b><i>He's slowing down.</i></b>

16:37.700 --> 16:40.220
<b><i>No, we're getting faster.</i></b>

16:42.370 --> 16:44.690
<b><i>Practice pays off that much more</i></b>

16:45.700 --> 16:50.630
<b><i>when you're fighting an equal for your life.</i></b>

16:57.340 --> 16:58.580
<b><i>Damn...</i></b>

17:01.650 --> 17:03.330
<b><i>Damn!</i></b>

17:06.570 --> 17:07.840
<b><i>I never...</i></b>

17:08.380 --> 17:10.590
<b><i>I never wanted</i></b>

17:10.590 --> 17:12.620
<b><i>to live this way!</i></b>

17:17.150 --> 17:18.850
<b><i>That's why I was against this!</i></b>

17:18.850 --> 17:21.970
<b><i>You're the one who said 
this would be a shortcut.</i></b>

17:21.970 --> 17:23.870
<b><i>Now it's my fault?</i></b>

17:23.870 --> 17:27.230
<b><i>Look at my clothes... 
They're dirty now.</i></b>

17:27.620 --> 17:31.350
<b><i>I wasn't looking for a reward...</i></b>

17:31.350 --> 17:33.630
<b><i>I wasn't expecting any gratitude...</i></b>

17:34.450 --> 17:35.740
<b><i>I just...</i></b>

17:39.720 --> 17:42.120
<b>That's enough.</b>

17:43.800 --> 17:45.560
<b>There's no way I can defeat you.</b>

17:46.210 --> 17:47.340
<b>Kill me.</b>

17:47.340 --> 17:49.820
<b>Why? We won't kill you.</b>

17:49.820 --> 17:53.130
<b>You've helped us make a lot of progress.</b>

17:53.460 --> 17:56.010
<b>Thank you, Binolt-san!</b>

17:56.790 --> 17:58.360
<b><i>I only wanted</i></b>

18:00.330 --> 18:02.770
<b><i>to lead a normal life.</i></b>

18:07.060 --> 18:08.410
<b>Go on.</b>

18:10.840 --> 18:12.910
<b>Once I leave, I'll turn myself in.</b>

18:17.140 --> 18:18.160
<b><i>Gon...</i></b>

18:18.600 --> 18:20.140
<b><i>You're flawless,</i></b>

18:20.140 --> 18:22.030
<b><i>a perfect gem.</i></b>

18:22.030 --> 18:25.840
<b><i>But that pure nature could be your undoing.</i></b>

18:28.070 --> 18:31.280
<b>Well, let's head for Masadora.</b>

18:31.280 --> 18:32.290
<b>Osu!</b>

18:32.290 --> 18:34.420
<b>The number 9!</b>

18:34.420 --> 18:35.530
<b>Too slow!</b>

18:35.530 --> 18:37.550
<b>Give me three thousand push-ups.</b>

18:37.550 --> 18:39.860
<b>Damn...</b>

18:39.860 --> 18:42.280
<b>Masadora's about seventy kilometers away.</b>

18:42.280 --> 18:44.810
<b>That's a three-hour trip, at most.</b>

18:44.810 --> 18:47.060
<b>Seriously?</b>

18:57.140 --> 18:58.450
<b>Oh, there it is!</b>

18:58.990 --> 19:01.950
<b>City of Magic 
Masadora</b>

18:59.150 --> 19:01.950
<b>Let's find a department store now!</b>

19:03.540 --> 19:06.340
<b>They're only selling cards...</b>

19:06.340 --> 19:07.690
<b>Sorry for the wait.</b>

19:07.690 --> 19:10.250
<b>Let's return to that rocky area.</b>

19:10.250 --> 19:11.960
<b>What?!</b>

19:15.170 --> 19:16.010
<b><i>Gain!</i></b>

19:18.180 --> 19:21.010
<b>These are the cards you bought?</b>

19:21.010 --> 19:21.970
<b>Yep.</b>

19:22.280 --> 19:24.920
<b>We'll head back to Masadora now.</b>

19:25.340 --> 19:26.420
<b>However,</b>

19:26.420 --> 19:27.940
<b>we'll go in a straight line!</b>

19:27.940 --> 19:29.970
<b>Huh? A straight line?</b>

19:29.970 --> 19:31.100
<b>You can't mean...</b>

19:31.570 --> 19:32.640
<b>Yep!</b>

19:33.840 --> 19:36.480
<b>It's time to dig!</b>

19:39.390 --> 19:41.470
<b>The rock isn't as hard as I was expecting.</b>

19:41.470 --> 19:44.240
<b>Yeah, this should go pretty smoothly.</b>

19:56.230 --> 19:58.070
<b>This is rough...</b>

19:58.070 --> 20:00.050
<b>No more...</b>

20:01.470 --> 20:02.850
<b>Hold on.</b>

20:02.850 --> 20:04.420
<b>If you're going to rest, sit properly.</b>

20:04.860 --> 20:05.470
<b>Huh?</b>

20:05.860 --> 20:08.050
<b>Starting today, you must always 
sleep in this position.</b>

20:08.050 --> 20:09.740
<b>Don't let go of the rope.</b>

20:09.740 --> 20:11.750
<b>There's a chance I might cut the rope,</b>

20:11.750 --> 20:15.360
<b>so keep a portion of your 
brain alert while you sleep.</b>

20:16.530 --> 20:20.300
<b><i>My old man put me through this 
kind of training all the time.</i></b>

20:27.980 --> 20:29.890
<b>Ow!</b>

20:30.610 --> 20:33.820
<b>Okay, when it falls, 
you have to put it back up.</b>

20:37.690 --> 20:39.840
<b>Gon, your head...</b>

20:39.840 --> 20:41.300
<b>I'm good...</b>

20:41.720 --> 20:44.180
<b>I'll be making them bigger.</b>

20:44.510 --> 20:45.540
<b>Gon...</b>

20:45.540 --> 20:46.900
<b>I'm good!</b>

20:50.120 --> 20:52.980
<b>Ow!</b>

20:54.880 --> 20:57.530
<b>We've run into a really hard rock.</b>

20:57.530 --> 20:58.950
<b>Can we dig it up?</b>

20:59.990 --> 21:01.990
<b>I don't think a shovel will work.</b>

21:01.990 --> 21:05.330
<b>I can probably break it with a <i>Nen</i> punch.</b>

21:06.210 --> 21:07.290
<b>What's wrong?</b>

21:07.690 --> 21:10.610
<b>Killua, what were you doing with 
your aura while digging?</b>

21:10.610 --> 21:12.920
<b>I wasn't doing anything unusual.</b>

21:12.920 --> 21:15.680
<b>Think of the shovel as part of your body!</b>

21:17.360 --> 21:18.680
<b><i>I see.</i></b>

21:18.680 --> 21:22.580
<b><i>If we shroud the shovel in aura, 
our digging will be stronger!</i></b>

21:24.590 --> 21:27.440
<b>Wow! The rock's as soft as pudding!</b>

21:27.440 --> 21:29.850
<b>Okay! Let's keep on digging!</b>

21:30.290 --> 21:34.490

<b>G.I. Tutorial</b>

<b>Coming up, it's the

23:06.820 --> 23:09.090
<b>Today, we're introducing the card Blue Planet.</b>

23:07.720 --> 23:18.750
<b>Blue Planet 

A gemstone with an 
incomparable blue shine. 
Its composition matches 
no known minerals, 
so it's named for its 
otherworldly nature.</b>

23:09.090 --> 23:11.930
<b>It's one of the reasons Bisky is playing the game.</b>

23:11.930 --> 23:14.430
<b>She's going through all this just for a stone?</b>

23:14.430 --> 23:16.550

<b>Strengthen!</b>

23:30.880 --> 23:31.930
<b>Ahem!</b>

23:31.930 --> 23:33.100
<b>Don't threaten!</b>
