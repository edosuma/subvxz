00:01.386 --> 00:03.787
You are being watched.

00:03.789 --> 00:06.056
The government
has a secret system--

00:06.058 --> 00:10.811
a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:10.813 --> 00:13.096
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:13.098 --> 00:14.598
but it sees everything...

00:14.600 --> 00:18.335
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people.

00:18.337 --> 00:21.221
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:21.223 --> 00:23.407
We don't.

00:23.409 --> 00:28.028
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:28.030 --> 00:29.830
You will never find us.

00:29.832 --> 00:32.082
But victim or perpetrator,

00:32.084 --> 00:35.402
if your number's up, we'll find you.

00:35.403 --> 00:38.424
Sync and corrections by n17t01

00:38.459 --> 00:39.923
Did you see it happen?

00:39.925 --> 00:43.010
No, but she did.
She saw everything.

00:43.012 --> 00:44.428
Where's the girl now?

00:44.430 --> 00:46.547
Are you sure you can keep her safe?

00:46.549 --> 00:50.033
Of course.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.404
Did you know that
the first public cell phone call

00:54.406 --> 00:57.391
was made
from the New York Hilton? 1973.

00:57.393 --> 00:59.092
There's also a rumor that the Martini

00:59.094 --> 01:00.677
was invented at the Knickerbocker,

01:00.679 --> 01:02.095
but there are some people
in San Francisco

01:02.097 --> 01:03.430
that would dispute that.

01:03.432 --> 01:05.765
I feel like I should be taking notes.

01:05.767 --> 01:08.268
You find my fascination
with hotels to be peculiar,

01:08.270 --> 01:09.653
don't you?

01:09.655 --> 01:12.456
You sharing anything personal
is peculiar.

01:12.458 --> 01:14.958
A hotel is one of the last few places

01:14.960 --> 01:17.794
where a person can retain
relative anonymity.

01:17.796 --> 01:20.280
Makes it easier when
disappearing foreign diplomats

01:20.282 --> 01:21.832
from their penthouses.

01:21.834 --> 01:23.884
With any luck, Mr. Reese,
we can prevent a murder,

01:23.886 --> 01:25.919
rather than the alternative.

01:25.921 --> 01:28.088
Yeah.

01:28.949 --> 01:30.938
_

01:30.973 --> 01:32.893
Mira Dobrica.

01:32.895 --> 01:36.597
You sure the threat to her
is work-related?

01:36.599 --> 01:38.348
Ms. Dobrica is single,
lives alone,

01:38.350 --> 01:40.317
doesn't do much social networking,

01:40.319 --> 01:42.319
and she puts in
a 60-hour work week.

01:42.321 --> 01:44.187
Whatever's gonna happen,

01:44.189 --> 01:46.189
it makes sense
that it would happen here.

01:46.191 --> 01:47.991
They say a maid can tell
everything about you

01:47.993 --> 01:49.809
from how you leave your room.

01:49.811 --> 01:52.829
All sorts of things
happen in hotel rooms.

01:52.831 --> 01:54.314
Mira's job could have put her

01:54.316 --> 01:56.983
at the wrong place at the wrong time.

01:56.985 --> 01:59.703
What about her life
before coming to America?

01:59.705 --> 02:01.488
Bit of a mystery.
She came here in '99,

02:01.490 --> 02:04.041
when computer records
weren't what they are today.

02:04.043 --> 02:06.159
I put in a call to Immigration Services,

02:06.161 --> 02:08.628
as a prospective employer.

02:08.631 --> 02:10.180
Would that be Mr. Wren

02:10.181 --> 02:13.133
from Universal Heritage Insurance?

02:13.135 --> 02:15.185
You know, her shift
starts in five minutes,

02:15.187 --> 02:19.189
which means that ours starts in four.

02:19.191 --> 02:21.058
They were hiring a bellhop
and a concierge.

02:21.060 --> 02:22.559
The choice seemed obvious.

02:22.561 --> 02:23.977
I interviewed last night,

02:23.979 --> 02:26.179
made sure that your resume
would stand out.

02:26.181 --> 02:29.199
Oh, by the way, you worked
at the Hotel Lutetia

02:29.201 --> 02:31.368
in Paris for two years.

02:31.370 --> 02:34.705
You'll have access to every room
with your employee key card.

02:34.707 --> 02:36.690
I can research the guests and exploit

02:36.692 --> 02:40.460
any necessary systems from my desk.

02:40.462 --> 02:44.965
700 guests in this hotel.

02:44.967 --> 02:48.201
One of them is planning a murder.

02:48.203 --> 02:51.388
Where do we start?

02:53.040 --> 02:54.424
Harold.

02:54.426 --> 02:56.143
Glad you could start
on such short notice.

02:56.145 --> 02:57.728
Derek, my pleasure.

02:57.730 --> 02:59.596
When you're on the clock,
it's Mr. Fowler.

02:59.598 --> 03:02.983
This is bud, my head doorman.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.570
And you are again?

03:06.572 --> 03:11.158
John. I worked
at the Hotel Lutetia.

03:11.160 --> 03:14.077
Right.

03:14.079 --> 03:16.530
Your desk is right over there.

03:16.532 --> 03:19.333
Remember,
always recommend our restaurant

03:19.335 --> 03:20.751
before suggesting anywhere else.

03:20.753 --> 03:22.753
- Very good.
- We're hosting an event

03:22.755 --> 03:25.739
for the Association
of Aviation Technology tomorrow,

03:25.741 --> 03:31.428
and most of the attendees
are arriving today, so...

03:31.430 --> 03:35.132
no excuse for standing around.

03:35.134 --> 03:38.385
Are you waiting
for a written invitation?

03:41.973 --> 03:44.591
Let me help you with that.

03:49.530 --> 03:52.932
Mr. Reese,
Mira should be housekeeping

03:52.934 --> 03:55.101
on the 30th floor.

03:55.103 --> 03:58.572
I just finished a run on 12.
I'll head up.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:08.616 --> 04:09.916
John.

04:09.918 --> 04:11.635
Zoe.

04:11.637 --> 04:14.788
Haven't seen you since the divorce.

04:14.790 --> 04:16.339
You working?

04:16.341 --> 04:19.392
Yeah.
You working?

04:19.394 --> 04:23.180
Always.

04:23.182 --> 04:26.400
Like the suit.

04:31.239 --> 04:33.907
I'm planting the camera on her cart.

04:33.909 --> 04:36.526
We can see exactly where she is
at all times.

04:36.528 --> 04:38.078
I didn't take your money.

04:38.080 --> 04:41.531
I had 50 bucks in my wallet,
and now I don't.

04:41.533 --> 04:44.584
Finch, who's in room 3024?

04:44.586 --> 04:48.455
Tug Brantley, CEO
of the Aggro Push energy drink.

04:48.457 --> 04:50.424
I'm a Platinum Member of this place.

04:50.426 --> 04:51.675
Do you have any idea

04:51.677 --> 04:53.293
how difficult I can make your life?

04:53.295 --> 04:55.429
- Come on.
- What do you want from me?

04:55.431 --> 04:58.215
I wanna know if those lips
taste like the chocolate mints

04:58.217 --> 04:59.933
you leave on my pillow.

04:59.935 --> 05:02.636
I'm going to come back
when you're not here.

05:02.638 --> 05:07.006
Are you really going to turn me down?

05:07.008 --> 05:09.676
- Is there a problem here?
- Who invited you in?

05:09.678 --> 05:12.846
Mr. Reese, could you try
not to get fired before lunch?

05:12.848 --> 05:16.366
Being a Platinum Member
doesn't entitle you

05:16.368 --> 05:18.201
to sexually harass our staff.

05:18.203 --> 05:22.038
If you disagree, we can have
the police sort this out.

05:22.040 --> 05:25.292
You're lucky
I don't report you to your boss.

05:28.412 --> 05:30.747
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

05:30.749 --> 05:32.799
That sort of thing happens
every other week, you know.

05:32.801 --> 05:34.217
I could have handled it.

05:34.219 --> 05:37.304
Sounds like a rough gig.
I'm John.

05:37.306 --> 05:39.005
Mira.

05:39.007 --> 05:42.876
So strong, handsome guy
your age working as a bellhop.

05:42.878 --> 05:44.895
Must have made a wrong turn somewhere.

05:44.897 --> 05:47.848
Yeah, I stopped counting awhile back.

05:47.850 --> 05:50.383
Well you're in for a rough gig yourself.

05:50.385 --> 05:51.601
Our brilliant manager

05:51.603 --> 05:53.019
should have staffed four bellhops.

05:53.021 --> 05:54.905
Instead, it's just you and Randy,

05:54.907 --> 05:57.774
and he takes more smoke breaks
than he does luggage.

05:57.776 --> 06:00.577
You seem to know
your way around this place.

06:00.579 --> 06:06.333
Hotel management is hard work,
but it's not rocket science.

06:06.335 --> 06:11.037
Speaking of which,
I should get back to work.

06:11.039 --> 06:15.091
Guess I'll be seeing you around then.

06:16.911 --> 06:18.845
_

06:18.847 --> 06:22.349
Oh, I really like this girl, Finch.

06:22.351 --> 06:24.434
I heard back from Immigration Services.

06:24.436 --> 06:27.938
Mira sought asylum as a Serbian refugee,

06:27.940 --> 06:29.923
a survivor of the Kosovo war.

06:29.925 --> 06:32.976
I thought most refugees
from that war were Albanian.

06:32.978 --> 06:36.363
Most were,
but both sides suffered losses.

06:36.365 --> 06:39.098
Seeing as how Mira came alone,

06:39.100 --> 06:41.267
we can only assume
that whatever family she had

06:41.269 --> 06:42.953
didn't make it out.

06:42.955 --> 06:44.955
She was 16 at the time.

06:44.957 --> 06:48.708
She's been on her own ever since.

06:50.878 --> 06:52.913
Here's a map of midtown.

06:52.915 --> 06:54.831
That's the Theater District,
Columbus Circle,

06:54.833 --> 06:56.166
and the beginning of the Park.

06:56.168 --> 06:59.636
- It's a good start.
- Thank you.

06:59.638 --> 07:02.121
I managed to hack
into the security network

07:02.123 --> 07:04.057
and piggyback on their feeds,
allowing me access

07:04.059 --> 07:07.060
to all the hotel's cameras.

07:07.062 --> 07:09.062
Uh, excuse me.
Where's the--

07:09.064 --> 07:10.397
Oh,
the ladies' is around--

07:10.399 --> 07:13.299
and the gents', the opposite.

07:20.241 --> 07:22.776
Mira.

07:25.413 --> 07:27.163
Is something wrong?

07:27.165 --> 07:31.001
Police were asking questions
about our little side operation.

07:31.003 --> 07:32.869
It got me thinking about how they knew

07:32.871 --> 07:35.338
to poke around in the first place.

07:35.340 --> 07:38.324
- It-- it wasn't me.
- No.

07:38.326 --> 07:41.428
You're not stupid enough
to do a thing like that

07:41.430 --> 07:43.179
because you know how upset I would be

07:43.181 --> 07:44.931
if I found out it was you.

07:44.933 --> 07:47.517
Of course.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.439
Mr. Reese,
we can add hotel staff

07:52.441 --> 07:54.808
to our list of potential threats.

08:00.482 --> 08:02.482
Sir.

08:02.484 --> 08:05.318
Welcome back to the land of the free.

08:05.320 --> 08:07.904
Getting out of Rikers
took longer than I anticipated.

08:07.906 --> 08:09.456
I understand our rogue operative

08:09.458 --> 08:11.074
slipped away from you in there.

08:11.076 --> 08:13.627
It won't happen again.
I know his face now.

08:15.914 --> 08:18.248
Need you to work fast.

08:18.250 --> 08:20.417
Ever since he assaulted
our DOD facility,

08:20.419 --> 08:22.335
our source has become compromised.

08:22.337 --> 08:23.870
Compromised, sir?

08:23.872 --> 08:26.056
This man has connections
to a dangerous party.

08:26.058 --> 08:27.891
It's imperative that you find him

08:27.893 --> 08:29.843
and figure out who he works for.

08:29.845 --> 08:31.978
Wherever he goes,
a mess usually follows.

08:31.980 --> 08:34.147
All I have to do is find the right mess.

08:34.149 --> 08:36.265
I'm sure you'll work it out,

08:36.268 --> 08:38.101
and when you're done with him,

08:38.102 --> 08:42.355
- make sure no one finds him.
- Understood.

08:58.507 --> 08:59.789
Any available units,

08:59.791 --> 09:01.875
please respond to a 10-50
in progress

09:01.877 --> 09:04.010
at the intersection of 46th and 3rd.

09:18.316 --> 09:20.016
- Thanks.
- Hey, so listen,

09:20.018 --> 09:21.735
there's something you should know.

09:21.737 --> 09:24.988
I'm in a bit of...
trouble.

09:24.990 --> 09:28.875
- Serious?
- Yeah.

09:28.877 --> 09:30.910
My mom wants to set me up

09:30.912 --> 09:32.896
with this woman who goes to her church.

09:32.898 --> 09:36.082
Oh.
Well, that's pretty serious.

09:36.084 --> 09:37.534
Yeah.

09:37.536 --> 09:38.651
What'd you say?

09:38.653 --> 09:40.203
That I'm seeing someone.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.488
It could be serious.

09:42.490 --> 09:43.840
That right?

09:43.842 --> 09:46.042
I don't know.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.128
Have you told your son anything?

09:48.130 --> 09:50.964
Mm, I may have mentioned a thing or two,

09:50.966 --> 09:53.466
that I met a man who's nice and funny,

09:53.468 --> 09:55.135
easy on the eyes.

09:56.504 --> 09:58.388
Taylor's happy for me,

09:58.390 --> 10:01.608
so what do you think about meeting him?

10:01.610 --> 10:05.011
I'm cool with it.
You?

10:05.013 --> 10:09.366
I think it might be time.

10:09.368 --> 10:11.184
But let's talk more
about it later. I gotta go.

10:11.186 --> 10:13.820
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:15.522 --> 10:17.791
SAIC Moss.

10:17.793 --> 10:20.043
Didn't think
I'd ever see you here again.

10:20.045 --> 10:22.128
I'm on a matter regarding
Special Agent Donnelly.

10:22.130 --> 10:23.963
After he died, I took it upon myself

10:23.965 --> 10:25.915
to review his old files.

10:25.917 --> 10:29.252
Found something that might interest you.

10:29.254 --> 10:32.205
I discovered a recommendation
to make you a Field Agent.

10:32.207 --> 10:34.624
Donnelly ever discuss that with you?

10:34.626 --> 10:37.060
Once or twice, yeah.

10:37.062 --> 10:38.845
I'm ready to run it up the flagpole,

10:38.847 --> 10:40.980
but only if you're still interested.

10:40.982 --> 10:41.981
I am.

10:41.983 --> 10:43.650
Great.

10:43.652 --> 10:45.151
Then with your permission,

10:45.153 --> 10:46.853
we'll initiate the background check,

10:46.855 --> 10:48.154
interview friends, family,

10:48.156 --> 10:50.940
any contacts from the past ten years.

10:50.942 --> 10:52.609
Okay, whatever you need.

10:52.611 --> 10:54.727
Are you available to take
a polygraph this evening?

10:54.729 --> 10:56.913
- Polygraph?
- Standard procedure.

10:56.915 --> 10:58.198
You can take it here in the precinct.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.417
Okay, it shouldn't be a problem.

11:00.419 --> 11:03.670
- Then we'll see you later.
- Okay.

11:06.006 --> 11:07.624
FBI, huh?

11:07.626 --> 11:11.244
You really gonna go through with this?

11:11.246 --> 11:13.430
Yeah.

11:13.432 --> 11:15.545
I guess so.

11:21.973 --> 11:24.057
The spa's located
past the elevator banks,

11:24.059 --> 11:25.392
through a glass door on your right.

11:25.394 --> 11:28.228
- You can't miss it.
- Sounds great.

11:30.698 --> 11:32.749
Everything all right,
Mr. Reese?

11:32.751 --> 11:34.918
I feel like I'm back at boot camp,

11:34.920 --> 11:38.038
and we still haven't zeroed in
on the threat to Mira yet.

11:41.075 --> 11:45.095
Same girl we saw before,
but she's with a different guy.

11:45.097 --> 11:48.181
The side operation Derek's running

11:48.183 --> 11:49.599
might be girls.

11:49.601 --> 11:51.635
I made a similar observation.

11:51.637 --> 11:54.604
Detective Carter should be
getting back to me soon

11:54.606 --> 11:57.057
on any known solicitation activity.

11:57.059 --> 11:59.859
Look who has time to chat.

11:59.861 --> 12:02.862
A bus just arrived
full of airplane geeks.

12:02.864 --> 12:04.614
Check them in, and let's make sure

12:04.616 --> 12:07.617
they don't crowd up the common areas.

12:09.036 --> 12:12.289
Oh, I really hope Derek's the threat.

12:14.159 --> 12:15.709
Detective Carter.

12:15.711 --> 12:17.127
I checked with Vice.

12:17.129 --> 12:18.795
They picked up a working girl
a few days ago

12:18.797 --> 12:21.164
at that hotel off an anonymous tip,

12:21.166 --> 12:23.249
but the girl didn't say boo,

12:23.251 --> 12:25.635
and her bail was posted within an hour.

12:25.637 --> 12:30.140
- By whom?
- By a guy named Bud Garrison.

12:31.008 --> 12:32.759
Our floor manager's pet.

12:32.761 --> 12:34.144
Thank you.

12:34.146 --> 12:36.980
- Anything else?
- Should there be?

12:36.982 --> 12:42.135
I just assume you heard
my conversation with Moss.

12:42.137 --> 12:43.853
I hear everything, Detective.

12:43.855 --> 12:46.656
So you know he thinks
I'm qualified to join the feds.

12:46.658 --> 12:48.408
Well, what do you think?

12:48.410 --> 12:50.193
I just think it'll be
a great opportunity,

12:50.195 --> 12:51.578
assuming I get in.

12:51.580 --> 12:53.980
You're concerned about the polygraph.

12:53.982 --> 12:55.865
Considering I've been lying
about you guys

12:55.867 --> 12:57.834
for over a year, a little.

12:57.836 --> 13:00.286
You know, polygraphs don't detect lies,

13:00.288 --> 13:03.269
just physiological responses.

13:04.843 --> 13:08.178
Try lying on one
of the baseline questions,

13:08.180 --> 13:09.579
it might trick the test into thinking

13:09.581 --> 13:10.997
that everything you say is normal.

13:10.999 --> 13:13.850
Yeah, it's just a machine, right?

13:13.852 --> 13:15.852
I mean, how smart can it be?

13:15.854 --> 13:18.271
Exactly.
Just a machine.

13:18.273 --> 13:20.940
Oh, in the meantime,
it might be wise for you

13:20.942 --> 13:23.009
to steer clear of John and myself,

13:23.011 --> 13:24.778
just for the time being.

13:24.780 --> 13:27.346
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

13:27.348 --> 13:29.515
Thanks.

13:31.535 --> 13:34.904
Looks like Derek
is running an escort service.

13:34.906 --> 13:38.124
If Mira called in the tip,
he might be our threat.

13:38.126 --> 13:42.361
The sooner we can confirm it,
the sooner we can go home.

13:49.003 --> 13:51.171
Housekeeping.

13:55.393 --> 13:56.760
Sorry, we don't need service.

13:56.762 --> 13:58.094
My wife forgot to put the sign out.

13:58.096 --> 14:00.313
No problem.

14:03.651 --> 14:04.818
Housekeeping.

14:04.820 --> 14:06.719
Hey.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.271
I need to talk to you.

14:08.273 --> 14:09.856
I can't now.

14:09.858 --> 14:13.076
You know this can't wait.

14:15.496 --> 14:17.280
Mr. Reese?

14:17.282 --> 14:21.584
Mira's just been summoned
into room 3215 by a guest.

14:21.586 --> 14:23.586
Charles Harris.

14:23.588 --> 14:25.955
She didn't look
particularly happy to see him.

14:25.957 --> 14:29.626
You must be exhausted,
dropping bags off all day.

14:29.628 --> 14:31.010
According to his hotel bill,

14:31.012 --> 14:34.064
Mr. Harris drinks
more than he eats,

14:34.066 --> 14:35.765
and we have no way of knowing
what's going on in the room

14:35.767 --> 14:38.134
because Mira left her phone on her cart.

14:38.136 --> 14:39.853
She's three floors above you.

14:39.855 --> 14:42.055
How late do you deliver room service?

14:42.057 --> 14:44.607
I believe the hotel
delivers room service--

14:44.609 --> 14:46.059
- I'm not talking about the hotel.

14:46.061 --> 14:47.527
I'm talking about you.

14:47.529 --> 14:50.630
Feel free to drop yourself off...

14:50.632 --> 14:52.532
anytime.

14:52.534 --> 14:56.119
Huh.
Excuse me.

15:01.775 --> 15:05.328
I'm on the 32nd floor now.

15:05.330 --> 15:06.796
Don't try to push me, Harris.

15:06.798 --> 15:09.048
But you need to listen to reason.

15:09.050 --> 15:10.967
How can you expect me to agree to this?

15:10.969 --> 15:12.669
Because it's the right thing to do.

15:12.671 --> 15:15.338
Easy for you to say.

15:15.340 --> 15:18.842
Next time, damn well knock.

15:18.844 --> 15:21.728
What are you doing here?

15:24.064 --> 15:26.683
I was checking the minibar.

15:26.685 --> 15:29.235
I'll save you the trouble.
It's empty.

15:29.237 --> 15:31.821
We'll talk later.

15:31.823 --> 15:34.473
Ms. Brozi, Ms. Brozi!

15:34.475 --> 15:37.410
Please reconsider.

15:43.450 --> 15:45.335
What's your problem?

15:45.337 --> 15:48.121
That's the second time
you've walked in on me.

15:48.123 --> 15:50.673
It's Derek, isn't it?
He has you following me around.

15:50.675 --> 15:52.825
Are you in some kind
of trouble with him?

15:52.827 --> 15:54.127
I know he's running girls out of here.

15:54.129 --> 15:55.762
I also know you're involved.

15:55.764 --> 15:58.798
I clean the rooms, that's my job.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.049
I've worked too hard

16:00.051 --> 16:01.500
to get involved in some sleazy scheme.

16:01.502 --> 16:04.337
Is that why you tipped off the police?

16:04.339 --> 16:06.105
That's none of your business.

16:06.107 --> 16:08.725
What about the booze hound
in there? I heard the yelling.

16:08.727 --> 16:11.027
He's harmless.
It was nothing.

16:11.029 --> 16:13.279
Are you sure about that,
Ms. Dobrica?

16:13.281 --> 16:16.983
Or is that "Brozi"?

16:20.187 --> 16:22.121
You know nothing about me,

16:22.123 --> 16:25.208
what I've seen, what I've been through.

16:25.210 --> 16:29.195
I don't need help, especially
from someone like you.

16:29.197 --> 16:32.498
Just stay away from me, got it?

16:37.037 --> 16:41.558
We do have a good steakhouse
here in the hotel, but...

16:41.560 --> 16:43.209
personally, I'd recommend The Grand.

16:43.211 --> 16:46.162
Best rib eye in town.
You will not be disappointed.

16:46.164 --> 16:48.181
Shall I put you down for 7:30?

16:48.183 --> 16:49.566
- Sure, thanks.
- Okay.

16:54.155 --> 16:56.389
I've been researching our guest.

16:56.391 --> 16:59.275
Charles Harris is a freelance journalist

16:59.277 --> 17:01.895
working with a number
of respected publications.

17:01.897 --> 17:03.246
He's the kind of writer

17:03.248 --> 17:04.948
that has strong opinions
about world leaders,

17:04.950 --> 17:09.002
making him persona non grata
in a half dozen countries.

17:09.003 --> 17:11.421
What's his interest in Mira?

17:11.423 --> 17:14.573
Not sure, but if he came
all this way to talk to her,

17:14.575 --> 17:16.909
she might be some kind of source.

17:16.911 --> 17:19.462
A girl who flees her country
and changes her name

17:19.464 --> 17:21.431
is someone who doesn't want to be found.

17:21.433 --> 17:23.582
But if she's hiding,
who's she hiding from?

17:23.584 --> 17:25.518
That guy in the turtleneck.

17:25.520 --> 17:28.354
He's been sitting there
since we arrived.

17:28.356 --> 17:29.772
Have you seen him move at all?

17:29.774 --> 17:31.691
- I don't believe so.
- Yeah, well,

17:31.693 --> 17:33.476
he's got a clear line of sight
of the front desk

17:33.478 --> 17:34.694
and the entrance.

17:34.696 --> 17:36.762
Might be waiting for somebody.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.982
And if he's not?

17:38.984 --> 17:40.933
Then what's he still doing here?

17:40.935 --> 17:46.122
How do you suggest we find out?

18:09.396 --> 18:10.897
What ya readin'?

18:10.899 --> 18:13.799
Nothing, it was here when I sat down.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.301
Good.

18:15.303 --> 18:17.904
Can't stand these airplane nuts.

18:17.906 --> 18:19.138
I mean, the pickup--

18:19.140 --> 18:21.908
Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry.

18:21.910 --> 18:23.443
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

18:23.445 --> 18:24.827
It's okay, it's fine.

18:24.829 --> 18:27.646
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.148
Who's he talking to?

18:29.150 --> 18:30.833
Pull up the downstairs feeds.

18:34.489 --> 18:35.988
Watch the man at the bar.

18:57.678 --> 19:00.847
The man at the side entrance
is taking his place.

19:00.849 --> 19:03.282
They're spotters.

19:03.284 --> 19:05.651
They're rotating positions
to patch the gaps

19:05.653 --> 19:08.237
in their surveillance.

19:08.239 --> 19:11.958
Military recon tactic.

19:11.960 --> 19:14.877
It's a hit squad, Finch.

19:14.879 --> 19:16.362
At least it's safe to say that we found

19:16.364 --> 19:18.534
the real threat to Mira.

19:19.718 --> 19:21.534
Who would send a hit squad
with military training

19:21.536 --> 19:23.202
to kill a hotel maid?

19:32.926 --> 19:36.095
Our spotter is headed
back downstairs, Finch.

19:36.097 --> 19:37.430
Where's Mira?

19:37.432 --> 19:39.515
She's in the kitchen, taking a break.

19:39.517 --> 19:43.135
Well, I'm going to check out his room.

19:43.137 --> 19:47.273
That room is registered
to a Peter Krieg,

19:47.275 --> 19:49.642
checked in under a German passport.

19:49.644 --> 19:51.160
Could be a forged identity.

19:51.162 --> 19:54.664
We need to know who sent the team.

19:54.666 --> 19:56.816
Any new information on Harris?

19:56.818 --> 20:00.670
- I see that his laptop
is signed onto the hotel wi-fi.

20:00.672 --> 20:02.205
If I can get past his firewall,

20:02.207 --> 20:04.707
I can see what kind of notes
he has on Mira.

20:07.494 --> 20:09.995
Our spotter has a file on Harris.

20:09.997 --> 20:12.548
Whatever's going on,

20:12.550 --> 20:15.968
it has to do with a series
of articles Harris wrote

20:15.970 --> 20:18.888
about a Serbian colonel
named Rudko Petrovic.

20:18.890 --> 20:20.556
That name sounds familiar.

20:20.558 --> 20:22.475
I believe he's running
for deputy prime minister.

20:22.477 --> 20:24.060
Harris all but accused him

20:24.062 --> 20:26.362
of committing war crimes in Kosovo.

20:26.364 --> 20:29.699
How does Mira fit into all this?

20:29.701 --> 20:31.350
I think I just found out.

20:31.352 --> 20:33.436
I'm in Harris's computer.

20:33.438 --> 20:36.355
Not only is her real last name "Brozi,"

20:36.357 --> 20:39.125
but she's ethnic Albanian, not Serbian.

20:39.127 --> 20:42.061
According to Harris's notes,

20:42.063 --> 20:43.429
mira witnessed Petrovic

20:43.431 --> 20:45.381
order the execution
of her entire family.

20:45.383 --> 20:47.383
It makes sense
that she lied to Immigration

20:47.385 --> 20:48.718
about her name and ethnicity,

20:48.720 --> 20:50.887
she was simply protecting herself.

20:50.889 --> 20:52.472
And Harris found the one witness

20:52.474 --> 20:54.056
who could bring down the colonel.

20:54.058 --> 20:55.641
They must have followed him
to the hotel,

20:55.643 --> 20:58.261
hoping he would establish
contact with his source.

20:58.263 --> 21:01.481
They'll make their move on Mira
as soon as they identify her.

21:01.483 --> 21:03.149
They may already have.

21:03.151 --> 21:05.351
What's the ETA on our backup?

21:05.353 --> 21:07.820
Arriving as we speak.

21:12.159 --> 21:14.827
Always a bar.

21:18.899 --> 21:21.204
Hi, give me a ginger ale.

21:24.404 --> 21:25.838
Mr. Reese,
all three spotters

21:25.840 --> 21:28.458
are back in their original positions.

21:28.460 --> 21:30.460
Keep an eye on them.
We'll deal with those guys

21:30.462 --> 21:32.840
after I get Mira out of here.

21:33.965 --> 21:37.216
You just don't give up, do you?

21:41.723 --> 21:45.107
John, the man
at the side entrance is moving.

21:51.782 --> 21:54.116
Why won't you just leave me alone?

21:54.118 --> 21:55.701
Aah!

21:55.703 --> 21:58.871
That a good enough reason?

21:58.873 --> 22:01.607
Ah!

22:08.382 --> 22:12.301
He was going to kill me...
for talking to the journalist.

22:12.303 --> 22:14.954
He was going to kill you for knowing

22:14.956 --> 22:19.008
what Petrovic did
to your family in Kosovo.

22:19.010 --> 22:20.927
What does that make you?

22:20.929 --> 22:25.231
Just a guy at the right place
at the right time.

22:34.276 --> 22:36.359
_

22:37.578 --> 22:39.312
Mr. Reese,
I've lost the connection

22:39.314 --> 22:40.813
to Harris's computer...

22:40.815 --> 22:42.848
and eyes on his floor.

22:42.850 --> 22:45.918
You'd better get to Mr. Harris's
room immediately.

22:47.087 --> 22:49.019
Stay close to me.

22:52.543 --> 22:56.345
All right, like to start
with a few basic questions.

22:56.347 --> 22:59.298
Is your name Jocelyn Carter?

22:59.300 --> 23:00.716
Yes.

23:00.718 --> 23:03.669
Are you a member
of the Homicide Task Force

23:03.671 --> 23:06.722
- in New York?
- Yes.

23:06.724 --> 23:09.358
Have you ever smoked marijuana?

23:12.479 --> 23:14.447
Yes.

23:14.449 --> 23:17.683
College.

23:17.685 --> 23:19.452
You're the first one to admit that.

23:19.454 --> 23:22.488
Okay, now, we can move on

23:22.490 --> 23:24.991
to the important stuff.

23:24.993 --> 23:26.576
Mr. Reese?

23:26.578 --> 23:28.794
It seems that Mr. Harris
remotely checked out of his room

23:28.796 --> 23:31.864
a few minutes ago.

23:42.142 --> 23:44.810
He's not here.

23:44.812 --> 23:47.930
Any chance another maid
cleaned this room?

23:47.932 --> 23:50.816
Not today.
This is my floor.

23:50.818 --> 23:52.985
You notice anything out of the ordinary?

23:52.987 --> 23:57.222
The chair--
it's usually over there.

24:03.947 --> 24:05.564
We're too late.

24:05.566 --> 24:08.250
They move fast.

24:08.252 --> 24:11.170
Cleaned up best they could.

24:14.675 --> 24:17.343
I thought he was a drunk.

24:17.345 --> 24:19.595
Yesterday, he tells me
he knows who I am,

24:19.597 --> 24:22.414
that Petrovic is the man
who killed my family.

24:22.416 --> 24:26.385
How did you escape, Mira?

24:26.387 --> 24:31.273
Sanja, a Serbian woman
across the street.

24:31.275 --> 24:33.726
I watched it happen from her attic.

24:33.728 --> 24:37.530
Then the man, Harris,
found Sanja last month,

24:37.532 --> 24:38.731
made a tape of her saying

24:38.733 --> 24:41.060
I could identify the colonel.

24:43.655 --> 24:46.105
She was found dead two weeks ago,

24:46.107 --> 24:49.375
probably from talking to the journalist.

24:51.111 --> 24:54.880
He said if I went public,
it would ensure my safety,

24:54.882 --> 24:56.933
but I refused.

24:58.452 --> 25:03.389
Look how far this monster
is willing to go.

25:03.391 --> 25:06.308
What choice do I have?

25:06.310 --> 25:09.478
I'm gonna get you out of here, Mira,

25:09.480 --> 25:12.815
but I need to know
how they found out about you.

25:12.817 --> 25:15.568
Did you tell anyone
you were talking with Harris?

25:15.570 --> 25:17.687
No, nobody.

25:17.689 --> 25:21.807
Then how could they have known
you were the witness?

25:21.809 --> 25:23.659
Unless...

25:23.661 --> 25:26.134
Give me your cell phone.

25:43.880 --> 25:47.433
The electromagnetic field
of a microphone...

25:49.503 --> 25:53.639
can interfere...

25:53.641 --> 25:57.026
with a cell phone.

26:07.537 --> 26:10.823
They overheard everything in this room.

26:12.909 --> 26:15.077
They're next door.

26:15.079 --> 26:18.664
Wait here.

26:27.257 --> 26:29.208
Aah!

26:29.210 --> 26:32.211
Oh!

26:37.184 --> 26:38.550
Mira?

26:38.552 --> 26:41.937
She's running for it, Finch.

26:49.913 --> 26:52.665
Finch, she just got on the elevator.

26:58.922 --> 27:02.758
Mira, I was just looking for you.

27:02.760 --> 27:04.827
Mr. Reese,
I'm afraid Mira's in there

27:04.829 --> 27:06.545
with another member of the hit squad.

27:06.547 --> 27:09.932
And she has nowhere to run.

27:20.539 --> 27:22.640
Do exactly as I say.

27:22.642 --> 27:27.095
Use your key card and take us
straight to the basement.

27:27.097 --> 27:28.479
I may be able to stall the elevator

27:28.481 --> 27:30.014
before it gets to the basement,

27:30.016 --> 27:32.250
might give you a chance
to get Mira out of there.

27:38.158 --> 27:39.824
I'm a little busy, Lionel.

27:41.828 --> 27:42.994
Yeah, one of your trained killers

27:42.996 --> 27:44.340
is leaving his post.

27:46.249 --> 27:49.500
So is the one in the lobby.

27:51.754 --> 27:54.005
He's taking rather
a large trunk with him.

27:54.007 --> 27:56.073
I don't know
what they could possibly--

27:56.075 --> 27:58.176
Oh, dear.
It's Harris.

27:58.178 --> 28:01.629
- They're disposing of the body.
- Body? What body?

28:01.631 --> 28:03.848
Detective, you can't
let them leave the hotel.

28:14.443 --> 28:17.595
The recording, where is it?

28:17.597 --> 28:20.031
I don't know of any recording.

28:23.101 --> 28:25.453
The one of Sanja, your old neighbor,

28:25.455 --> 28:28.108
it wasn't in his room
or on his computer.

28:30.293 --> 28:32.126
I swear, I don't have it.

28:32.128 --> 28:34.879
No?
Too bad.

28:37.967 --> 28:40.284
I don't know who you are,

28:40.286 --> 28:42.754
but I'm prepared to shoot you
and 20 others like you

28:42.756 --> 28:43.954
to get what I came for.

28:54.350 --> 28:56.901
Glad that you're a better shot
than you are a bellhop.

28:56.903 --> 28:59.103
So am I.

28:59.105 --> 29:00.855
Detective, the barfly

29:00.857 --> 29:03.141
just left the building
through the back exit.

29:03.143 --> 29:05.326
Yeah, okay, I'm on it.

29:05.328 --> 29:07.144
- Oh, excuse me.
- Uh, sorry.

29:07.146 --> 29:09.313
Just looking for the bathroom.
I thought I saw a sign, but--

29:09.315 --> 29:10.915
Yeah, why don't you try
right up those stairs

29:10.917 --> 29:11.982
in the lobby?

29:11.984 --> 29:15.119
Oh, yeah.
Thanks, buddy.

29:21.377 --> 29:23.160
What do you say
we get you out of here now?

29:23.162 --> 29:26.097
Not yet. We have to get
the tape Harris made of Sanja.

29:26.099 --> 29:27.682
It's evidence Petrovic killed her.

29:27.684 --> 29:29.467
You said you didn't have it.

29:29.469 --> 29:33.170
I lied. He gave me a disc
to take home and watch.

29:33.172 --> 29:35.473
Thought it would persuade me
to tell my story.

29:35.475 --> 29:36.507
It's down in my locker.

29:36.509 --> 29:37.975
Well, that and your testimony

29:37.977 --> 29:39.510
would be enough to put Petrovic away.

29:39.512 --> 29:41.529
Assuming I live long enough.

29:41.531 --> 29:44.348
I'll come back for the disc
after we get you out of here.

29:44.350 --> 29:47.184
We don't know how many hit men are left.

29:47.186 --> 29:51.322
Drop us off on the next floor,
then shut this elevator down.

29:51.324 --> 29:54.459
Who are you talking to?

29:54.461 --> 29:55.710
Hello.

29:55.712 --> 29:57.879
This is Harold.
I work with John.

29:57.881 --> 30:00.364
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mira.

30:00.366 --> 30:02.633
Sure.

30:10.342 --> 30:11.809
Hey, excuse me, guys.

30:11.811 --> 30:13.394
Have you seen a little chihuahua?

30:13.396 --> 30:16.380
He's a little dog about this big.

30:26.024 --> 30:27.913
Ah, jeez.

30:32.449 --> 30:33.781
Yeah.

30:33.783 --> 30:35.616
I've got a new assignment for you.

30:35.618 --> 30:37.452
Meet me at the annex south of the lobby.

30:37.454 --> 30:39.087
Yeah, no problem.

30:39.089 --> 30:40.671
I'm fine, by the way,
considering I just took out

30:40.673 --> 30:42.457
two trained killers
trying to get rid of a body.

30:42.459 --> 30:44.041
Never doubted you for a second.

30:44.043 --> 30:45.743
Now, come and meet me.

30:45.745 --> 30:48.096
I'll be right there.
Let me just call these two in.

30:48.098 --> 30:50.515
Oh, and don't forget
the guys in the storage room

30:50.517 --> 30:51.582
and the elevator.

30:51.584 --> 30:53.434
Seriously?

30:53.436 --> 30:55.303
Got something?

30:55.305 --> 30:57.188
Big mess at The Coronet Hotel.

30:57.190 --> 30:58.606
Couple guys with gunshot wounds

30:58.608 --> 31:00.257
have been tied up
and gift-wrapped.

31:00.259 --> 31:01.592
Sounds like our man.

31:01.594 --> 31:05.012
What are you still talking to me for?

31:10.119 --> 31:13.121
This friend of yours, he's a policeman?

31:13.123 --> 31:15.706
Yeah.
Listen, Mira,

31:15.708 --> 31:18.626
he'll take you to his precinct.

31:18.628 --> 31:22.630
It's the safest place for you
until this is over.

31:22.632 --> 31:26.834
I've never really felt safe
since I left Kosovo.

31:26.836 --> 31:29.954
I was a girl when I ran away.

31:29.956 --> 31:35.460
New name, new country, I tried
to leave all that behind.

31:35.462 --> 31:36.894
But it's like I've just been waiting

31:36.896 --> 31:39.230
for all this to come back somehow,

31:39.232 --> 31:42.567
afraid of what would happen
to me if it did.

31:42.569 --> 31:45.436
From what I've seen,

31:45.438 --> 31:47.471
you're a lot braver than you think.

31:47.473 --> 31:52.076
I allowed Rudko Petrovic
get away with murder.

31:52.078 --> 31:56.164
My family, Sanja, now Harris.

31:56.166 --> 31:57.498
No more.

31:57.500 --> 32:00.484
Petrovic must be held accountable.

32:00.486 --> 32:02.587
You rang?

32:02.589 --> 32:06.355
Mira, this is Lionel,
and you can trust him.

32:08.127 --> 32:09.627
Nice to meet you.

32:09.629 --> 32:12.963
All right, you ready?

32:12.965 --> 32:15.299
Thank you, John.

32:15.301 --> 32:17.318
You're welcome.

32:17.320 --> 32:20.655
Okay, come on.
This way.

32:20.657 --> 32:22.190
Finch,

32:22.192 --> 32:25.576
now would be a good time
to tender your resignation.

32:35.838 --> 32:39.123
Have you ever lied
to people you work with?

32:39.125 --> 32:41.325
No.

32:42.511 --> 32:44.846
Have you ever knowingly associated

32:44.848 --> 32:46.214
with a wanted criminal?

32:46.216 --> 32:48.383
No.

32:48.385 --> 32:52.503
Have you--

33:04.015 --> 33:05.450
What was that about?

33:05.452 --> 33:07.952
How would you describe your relationship

33:07.954 --> 33:10.321
with Narcotics Detective Cal Beecher?

33:10.323 --> 33:12.073
Cal?

33:12.075 --> 33:15.993
You describe it as... platonic?

33:15.995 --> 33:18.195
Intimate?

33:18.197 --> 33:20.164
We see each other socially.

33:20.166 --> 33:21.749
Are you aware of any

33:21.751 --> 33:23.868
of the several IAB investigations

33:23.870 --> 33:25.303
into Detective Beecher?

33:25.305 --> 33:27.371
Investigations for what?

33:27.373 --> 33:29.891
I'm not at liberty to say.

33:29.893 --> 33:33.227
So you were not aware of any
of the ongoing investigations--

33:33.229 --> 33:37.148
No.
I was not aware.

33:53.750 --> 33:55.583
Where the hell have you been?

33:55.585 --> 33:59.587
You really have no idea
what's going on in your hotel,

33:59.589 --> 34:01.255
do you?

34:01.257 --> 34:04.125
You're me.
You find a first day employee

34:04.127 --> 34:06.043
sneaking around
in the ladies' locker room.

34:06.045 --> 34:08.262
What do you do?

34:08.264 --> 34:11.014
I don't know, something like this?

34:18.806 --> 34:23.027
I've got the disc.
Meet you back at the library.

34:25.230 --> 34:29.033
You're a hard man to find.

34:30.485 --> 34:33.487
The phone please.

34:36.126 --> 34:39.744
How about we go somewhere
a little more private?

34:51.684 --> 34:53.800
That's some line of questioning.

34:53.802 --> 34:55.652
Hope it gets easier from here.

34:55.655 --> 34:58.222
Unfortunately,
this can't go any further.

34:58.224 --> 35:02.293
I'm rescinding your offer
to join the Bureau.

35:02.295 --> 35:04.628
I'm sorry, Detective, sometimes
these things don't work out.

35:04.630 --> 35:06.246
Why not?

35:06.248 --> 35:07.648
I can't divulge that.

35:07.650 --> 35:10.084
I gave you plenty of answers
in that room.

35:10.086 --> 35:11.919
I can get one from you.

35:11.921 --> 35:14.088
In the future,

35:14.090 --> 35:17.091
I'd choose my company more wisely.

35:22.798 --> 35:25.265
- Yeah.
- Yeah, all right.

35:34.776 --> 35:36.276
Can I get you a soda?

35:36.278 --> 35:38.612
I'm fine.
Thank you.

35:38.614 --> 35:40.542
Okay, if you need anything,
I'll be right out here, okay?

35:46.571 --> 35:48.288
You missed all the fun.

35:48.290 --> 35:50.691
Wonderboy and I jump-started
an international incident.

35:50.693 --> 35:52.831
Shame I couldn't be there.

35:57.666 --> 35:59.550
You say you were mugged?

35:59.552 --> 36:03.203
Yeah, guy took my wallet and my watch.

36:03.205 --> 36:05.673
Okay.
Just wait right here, sir.

36:05.675 --> 36:07.675
Someone will be by shortly
to take your statement.

36:07.677 --> 36:09.843
Thanks, buddy.

36:21.573 --> 36:23.741
Get out.

36:23.743 --> 36:25.325
Get out!

36:28.614 --> 36:31.732
This can go one of two ways.

36:31.734 --> 36:33.734
Don't suppose one of those ways

36:33.736 --> 36:37.037
involves me walking out of here.

36:37.039 --> 36:39.740
Didn't think so.

36:39.742 --> 36:41.742
I don't care who you are.

36:41.744 --> 36:44.211
I don't care what you did to get here.

36:44.213 --> 36:48.549
All I want to know is who you work for.

36:48.551 --> 36:51.101
But that would be telling.

36:58.927 --> 37:02.196
What makes you think
I'm working for anyone, anyway?

37:02.198 --> 37:03.981
Because you're like me.

37:03.983 --> 37:07.284
We don't give orders, we execute them.

37:07.286 --> 37:09.202
Speak for yourself.

37:29.457 --> 37:34.094
One last time.
Who do you work for?

37:34.096 --> 37:37.514
You'll... never... know.

37:59.671 --> 38:03.590
Any deeper, and I would have
cut your celiac artery.

38:10.298 --> 38:13.467
You got about 20 minutes
before you bleed to death.

38:18.005 --> 38:20.340
You can keep coming after me,

38:20.342 --> 38:23.861
or you can get to the hospital.

38:25.346 --> 38:26.780
I wonder if your employers

38:26.782 --> 38:29.867
would have showed you
that kind of mercy.

38:36.023 --> 38:37.666
How's it going?

38:39.328 --> 38:43.864
Fine, just tired, you know?
Long day.

38:43.866 --> 38:47.668
Uh, I was thinking about
what we could do with Taylor.

38:47.670 --> 38:50.671
Maybe we can go to
the Botanical Garden Saturday.

38:50.673 --> 38:53.640
Yeah, I've been thinking about that.

38:53.642 --> 38:56.376
Maybe it is too soon, you know?

38:56.378 --> 39:00.264
Sure. Cool.

39:02.817 --> 39:05.068
Hey, Carter,
if you need to talk to me--

39:05.070 --> 39:08.856
I just need time.
That's it, Cal.

39:08.858 --> 39:11.909
You take as long as you need.

39:11.911 --> 39:15.579
I'm not going anywhere.

39:33.598 --> 39:34.965
- Uh-huh.
- Hey, Sarge.

39:34.967 --> 39:36.309
- You have a second?
- Yeah.

39:51.150 --> 39:52.649
Hey! Hey!

39:53.903 --> 39:55.319
Carter, he's got a weapon!

40:00.125 --> 40:01.879
Are you okay?

40:03.462 --> 40:06.713
Guess you didn't miss
all the fun after all.

40:17.892 --> 40:22.346
Colonel's career is over.
Next stop, The Hague.

40:29.904 --> 40:33.156
I'll have what he's having.

40:35.944 --> 40:38.829
What was your business here anyway?

40:38.831 --> 40:41.248
Well, let's just say
the convention wasn't as boring

40:41.250 --> 40:43.500
as I thought it would be.

40:43.502 --> 40:46.503
The things people try
to get away with in hotels.

40:46.505 --> 40:50.290
I see you boys made the news.

40:50.292 --> 40:52.626
Not too bad, considering you also helped

40:52.628 --> 40:54.845
to take down an escort ring.

40:54.847 --> 40:57.180
They'd barely gotten
the floor manager into handcuffs

40:57.182 --> 41:00.634
before he confessed
to the entire operation.

41:00.636 --> 41:02.886
Meanwhile, my phone hasn't let up.

41:02.888 --> 41:05.171
Councilmen needing to know
that their names

41:05.173 --> 41:07.724
aren't gonna surface on the client list.

41:07.726 --> 41:10.143
I appreciate the work.

41:10.145 --> 41:12.946
And to make sure
this place is run properly,

41:12.948 --> 41:15.682
Harold here bought the hotel.

41:15.684 --> 41:18.402
It needed proper management.

41:20.121 --> 41:22.823
John, Harold,

41:22.825 --> 41:24.741
this one's on the house.

41:24.743 --> 41:27.210
Ms. Brozi, I was hoping we could
go over the event calendar

41:27.212 --> 41:29.482
- for the month.
- Absolutely.

41:39.424 --> 41:42.175
Ever consider
doing in-house work?

41:42.177 --> 41:46.480
This place could use someone
in crisis management.

41:46.482 --> 41:48.882
I like to move around.

41:48.884 --> 41:52.569
More a freelancer, like you.

41:52.571 --> 41:55.989
It's a nice place.

41:55.991 --> 41:58.742
Maybe I'll even stick around
for one more night.

41:58.744 --> 42:03.246
Well, I heard it was all booked,

42:03.248 --> 42:07.451
but then again, you do know the owner.

42:08.736 --> 42:11.421
The penthouse suite.

42:11.423 --> 42:14.174
Another round?

42:24.102 --> 42:26.403
Sir, I have Mr. Hersh for you.

42:27.106 --> 42:28.645
Thank you, Ms. May.

42:30.225 --> 42:32.943
Well, you haven't checked in
for a while.

42:32.945 --> 42:35.479
I hit a snag.

42:35.481 --> 42:37.481
We have a bigger problem at home.

42:37.483 --> 42:39.783
I need you here ASAP.

42:39.785 --> 42:41.317
I'm on my way.

42:51.129 --> 42:53.497
Ms. May,
I need to draft a letter

42:53.499 --> 42:55.632
to the State Department.

42:55.634 --> 42:57.582
Be right in, sir.

43:03.307 --> 43:06.593
For your State Dinner
at the White House.

43:08.462 --> 43:13.400
Also, I picked up something
for your anniversary.

43:14.969 --> 43:17.652
God, I completely forgot.

43:19.108 --> 43:21.975
Ms. May, you've only worked
for me for two months,

43:21.977 --> 43:25.078
and already, you know me
better than I know myself.

43:25.080 --> 43:28.331
That's what I'm here for.

43:30.701 --> 43:32.485
Ready when you are, sir.

43:32.487 --> 43:34.621
To the Secretary of State,

43:34.623 --> 43:37.624
from Office of Special Counsel.
