WEBVTT

00:03.602 --> 00:06.299
I never figured out why
they make these bizarre toilet seats.

00:06.473 --> 00:10.409
You know? Like those clear Lucite
ones with all the coins in it?

00:10.577 --> 00:14.377
It's a lovely tribute to our
past president. It's not bad enough...

00:14.547 --> 00:19.246
...Lincoln got shot in the head, we
gotta drop our pants and sit on it too.

00:19.686 --> 00:23.281
It's just incomprehensible
that you would buy a thing like this.

00:23.456 --> 00:26.948
You install it on your toilet seat.
And this says what about you?

00:27.360 --> 00:31.888
I can't afford to throw money down
the toilet, but look how close I am.

00:39.239 --> 00:43.107
I cannot believe Lindsay's seeing you
after that <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i> thing.

00:43.276 --> 00:45.141
I think she finds
my stupidity charming.

00:46.079 --> 00:47.603
-As we all do.
-Yeah.

00:47.781 --> 00:51.547
Anyway, she's having some kind
of a family lunch. I'll swing by after.

00:51.718 --> 00:54.414
-So you gonna meet the mother?
-I'll zip in. "How do you do?"

00:54.587 --> 00:57.249
-Zip out. She'll love me.
-You're good with the mothers.

00:57.424 --> 01:00.723
You know, I'm better with the mothers
than I am with the daughters.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.988
-Maybe you should date the mothers.
-lf I could talk to the mothers...

01:04.164 --> 01:08.294
...and have sex with the daughters,
then I'd really have something going.

01:08.468 --> 01:10.129
-You've got something going.
-Yeah.

01:10.670 --> 01:11.967
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:12.138 --> 01:14.333
-You got a hammer?
-What do you need a hammer for?

01:14.507 --> 01:17.499
I got this new poster, 3-D art.
Computers generate it.

01:17.677 --> 01:20.407
-Yeah, I wanna see that. Bring it over.
-I don't have it now.

01:20.580 --> 01:23.640
I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's.
Elaine was framing stuff for him...

01:23.817 --> 01:25.751
...so she did me a favor.
Wanna take a ride?

01:25.919 --> 01:29.047
-No, I don't think so.
-George, you wanna go for a ride?

01:29.222 --> 01:30.849
-No.
-Oh, come on!

01:31.024 --> 01:34.084
Could you wait until the man
finishes...?

01:34.627 --> 01:36.219
All right, I've had it with you two.

01:36.396 --> 01:38.728
Hey, guess what? Remember that
woman you saw me with?

01:38.898 --> 01:40.593
She used to be
an Olympic gymnast.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.368
-A gymnast?
-Yeah. She's Romanian.

01:43.536 --> 01:45.595
She won a silver
at the '84 Olympics.

01:45.772 --> 01:49.173
A gymnast, Jerry.
Think of the flexibility.

01:49.576 --> 01:51.441
That sex will melt your face.

01:53.046 --> 01:56.277
-Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing.
-Bailing?

01:56.449 --> 01:59.941
Kramer, there's always a price
to pay for just a sexual dalliance.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.281
Jerry, you should pay that price.

02:02.822 --> 02:06.553
She's Romanian. What will I talk
to her about? Ceausescu?

02:06.926 --> 02:08.518
Ch-- What?

02:10.196 --> 02:14.724
Gymnast? I can't believe it.
You didn't tell me she was a gymnast.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.958
What is this?

02:19.572 --> 02:21.403
I'm putting my shirt back on.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.678
Back on? What was it doing off?

02:30.316 --> 02:34.878
I take it off when I go to the....
You know, to the office.

02:35.922 --> 02:38.049
What for?

02:38.224 --> 02:40.852
Frees me up, no encumbrances.

02:41.661 --> 02:45.153
-Unbuttoned or all the way off?
-All the way, baby.

02:45.398 --> 02:47.127
Of course.

02:48.535 --> 02:51.095
Again? Kramer, if you keep
getting these attacks...

02:51.271 --> 02:53.603
...you should see the doctor
and have it checked out.

02:53.773 --> 02:55.365
Yeah, yeah.

02:56.776 --> 02:59.244
-You always take the shirt off?
-Always.

02:59.412 --> 03:02.279
I tell you, knowing you is like going
into the jungle.

03:02.448 --> 03:06.248
I never know what I'm gonna find next,
and I'm real scared.

03:08.488 --> 03:11.924
Elaine, I need you to proofread
this report for my meeting...

03:12.091 --> 03:14.582
...with the Poland Creek
bottled-water people.

03:14.761 --> 03:16.626
-What meeting?
-I told you.

03:16.796 --> 03:19.264
I sit on the board of trustees
for Morgan Springs...

03:19.432 --> 03:22.026
...and we're trying to acquire
Poland Creek.

03:24.270 --> 03:26.898
Are you using a fountain pen?

03:27.740 --> 03:29.867
-Yes.
-They smear.

03:30.043 --> 03:34.002
Under no circumstances is ink
to be used in this office.

03:35.014 --> 03:39.314
All right, I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt.

03:41.721 --> 03:42.949
-Elaine.
-Come in. Come in.

03:43.122 --> 03:45.022
Yeah.

03:47.260 --> 03:49.057
Hi, right there. Yeah.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.924
-That's not it.
-Kramer, it's that--

03:53.099 --> 03:55.590
-There she blows.
-Kramer?

03:56.035 --> 03:58.799
Kramer, could you do this at home?
I don't think--

04:00.039 --> 04:02.906
-I've got work to do, okay?
-These are nice corners.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.977
Elaine, did I hear--?
This is very odd.

04:06.145 --> 04:10.343
Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers
generate them, big computers.

04:10.516 --> 04:13.781
Yes, I've heard about these.
How do they work?

04:13.953 --> 04:17.047
You blur your eyes like you're staring
straight through the picture...

04:17.223 --> 04:19.589
...and you keep
your eyes unfocused.

04:19.759 --> 04:21.351
Then....

04:23.896 --> 04:25.625
Yeah!

04:27.066 --> 04:28.897
-I don't see it.
-It's a spaceship...

04:29.068 --> 04:32.526
-...surrounded by planets, asteroids.
-I still don't see it.

04:32.705 --> 04:35.970
Okay. Kramer, that's enough.
Mr. Pitt has got work to do.

04:36.142 --> 04:37.632
You ever dream in 3-D?

04:37.810 --> 04:39.937
It's like the boogeyman
is coming right at you.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.876
-A spaceship, where?
-Right in here.

04:42.048 --> 04:43.413
Just keep your eyes unfocused.

04:45.418 --> 04:47.318
-Oh, Mama.
-Kramer, what's wrong?

04:47.487 --> 04:50.354
-Mama.
-Kramer, are you okay?

04:50.523 --> 04:53.424
I think I got to go to the doctor.
Oh, Mama!

04:53.960 --> 04:56.485
How long does it usually take?

05:03.202 --> 05:07.229
George, it is so nice
to finally meet you.

05:07.407 --> 05:09.705
And I'm sorry
we've kept Lindsay so long.

05:09.876 --> 05:11.605
-Mother.
-No, no, not at all.

05:11.778 --> 05:14.872
I have always felt that the
most important thing in the world...

05:15.048 --> 05:16.811
...is spending time with family.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.342
Are you and your family close?

05:19.986 --> 05:23.922
Very close. Almost painfully close.

05:24.257 --> 05:27.522
Mother, I'm gonna walk Nana
and Aunt Phyllis to the elevator.

05:27.694 --> 05:29.628
George, do you mind
waiting one more minute?

05:29.796 --> 05:32.287
Mind? Why would I mind?
I would love to wait.

05:32.465 --> 05:35.923
Nana, nice to see you.
Nana!

05:36.336 --> 05:39.134
Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure,
what a pleasure.

05:39.305 --> 05:41.865
Hey, let's do this again real soon.
I had fun.

05:42.041 --> 05:44.168
-Can I offer you anything to eat?
-No, I'm fine.

05:44.344 --> 05:47.336
-Let me help you with these dishes.
-George, you don't have to.

05:47.513 --> 05:50.175
No, I know I don't have to,
I want to.

05:50.350 --> 05:54.616
George, you are such a gentleman.

05:54.787 --> 05:56.721
I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright.

05:57.423 --> 05:59.220
Here we go. All right.

06:01.000 --> 06:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:23.983 --> 06:25.883
Mrs. Enright!

06:26.052 --> 06:27.542
Mrs. Enright!

06:28.221 --> 06:31.588
Look, there's a spaceship.
That is so cool.

06:31.758 --> 06:33.658
Where is it?

06:33.826 --> 06:35.384
-Right here.
-I'm looking there!

06:35.561 --> 06:38.394
-No, no, unfocus.
-I am unfocused!

06:42.668 --> 06:44.192
Hello?

06:45.538 --> 06:48.530
Oh, yeah. Okay, fine.
He'll be right down.

06:48.708 --> 06:51.108
Car's here to pick you up
and take you to the meeting.

06:51.277 --> 06:53.074
Meeting?

06:53.513 --> 06:55.743
The Poland Creek merger.

06:56.416 --> 07:00.819
-Why don't you go for me?
-How can I go?

07:00.987 --> 07:03.080
All they're gonna do
is read the report.

07:03.556 --> 07:06.423
Mr. Pitt, I do not think
that is just such a good idea.

07:06.592 --> 07:08.583
Oh, damn this thing!

07:10.596 --> 07:15.898
So Ceausescu,
he must have been some dictator.

07:16.068 --> 07:19.868
Yes, he was not shy about dictating.

07:20.139 --> 07:22.767
He must have been dictating
first thing in the morning.

07:22.942 --> 07:27.208
-I want a cup of coffee and a muffin.
-And you could not refuse.

07:27.380 --> 07:29.507
No, you'd have to be crazy.

07:30.516 --> 07:34.008
-He was a very bad dictator.
-Yes.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.319
Very bad.

07:37.023 --> 07:39.253
Very, very bad.

07:42.695 --> 07:45.459
So let me get this straight.
You find yourself in the kitchen.

07:45.631 --> 07:48.828
You see an Ã©clair
in the receptacle...

07:49.368 --> 07:51.563
...and you think to yourself:

07:51.838 --> 07:55.467
"What the hell,
I'll just eat some trash."

07:56.409 --> 08:00.539
No, no, no. It was not trash.

08:00.713 --> 08:02.476
-Was it in the trash?
-Yes.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.476
Then it was trash.

08:04.650 --> 08:07.847
It wasn't down in.
It was sort of on top.

08:08.221 --> 08:11.315
-But it was in the cylinder.
-Above the rim.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.221
Adjacent to refuse is refuse.

08:14.393 --> 08:17.055
It was on a magazine,
and it still had the doily on.

08:17.230 --> 08:20.290
-Was it eaten?
-One little bite.

08:20.933 --> 08:23.993
Well, that's garbage.

08:24.770 --> 08:28.206
But I know who took the bite.
It was her aunt.

08:28.508 --> 08:33.571
You, my friend, have crossed the line
that divides man and bum.

08:33.746 --> 08:36.044
You are now a bum.

08:37.283 --> 08:38.875
Hey.

08:39.418 --> 08:41.283
What's with you?

08:41.453 --> 08:43.251
I got a stone.

08:44.390 --> 08:46.756
-What stone?
-A kidney stone.

08:46.926 --> 08:48.416
What is that, anyway?

08:48.594 --> 08:53.156
It's a stony mineral concretion...

08:53.332 --> 08:55.698
...formed abnormally in the kidney.

08:55.868 --> 09:00.100
And this jagged shard of calcium
pushes its way through the ureter...

09:00.273 --> 09:04.869
...into the bladder.
It's forced out through the urine.

09:07.847 --> 09:09.678
Boy, that's gotta hurt.

09:11.517 --> 09:13.508
Our shareholders
have given basic approval...

09:13.686 --> 09:16.655
...for the merger,
including the stock swap.

09:17.690 --> 09:21.592
The stock swap.
Let's swap some stock.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.489
If you'll just give this to Mr. Pitt
and tell him that we expect...

09:25.665 --> 09:28.099
...to be in full-scale production
by the spring.

09:28.267 --> 09:30.735
All right. Hey, you guys,
what's the name...

09:30.903 --> 09:34.304
-...of the new company gonna be?
-Moland Spring.

09:34.807 --> 09:36.775
-Moland?
-Yes.

09:36.943 --> 09:39.309
We combined Morgan and Poland.

09:40.046 --> 09:43.174
Yeah, I know, but Moland?

09:43.349 --> 09:46.011
I wouldn't drink
anything called Moland.

09:46.185 --> 09:47.743
But it was Mr. Pitt's idea.

09:49.188 --> 09:54.023
Well, what's in a name?
I mean, water is water, right?

09:54.193 --> 09:57.060
We've got to do something
about that name.

09:57.563 --> 10:02.557
No, Lindsay, it was not in the garbage.
It was above the garbage.

10:02.735 --> 10:05.602
Hovering like an angel.

10:06.939 --> 10:11.433
Of course I know your aunt bit it.
I kissed her goodbye.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.845
Listen, can I tell you something else?
In my family...

10:15.014 --> 10:18.211
...we used to eat out of the garbage
all the time. It was no big thing.

10:18.384 --> 10:21.046
That's right. Okay.

10:21.220 --> 10:24.314
Bye-bye. I'm back in.
She gave me a second chance.

10:24.490 --> 10:26.355
-Good for you.
-Yes. Good for me.

10:26.525 --> 10:29.460
You know what you should do now?
Get her flowers, smooth it out.

10:29.629 --> 10:34.726
Yes. Flowers. I will get her flowers.
I will go to the florist.

10:35.468 --> 10:39.529
Behold, the games
of the '84 Olympiad.

10:39.705 --> 10:43.971
-Katya's silver-medal performance.
-Kramer, you're still on this?

10:44.143 --> 10:46.168
I've seen gymnasts.
I know what they do.

10:46.345 --> 10:49.473
-It's not gonna make any difference.
-Jerry, what is your problem?

10:49.649 --> 10:53.449
Kramer, you know,
guys like you with no conscience...

10:53.619 --> 10:55.678
...don't know what it's like
for guys like me.

10:55.855 --> 11:00.155
I'm in the unfortunate position of
having to consider people's feelings.

11:00.326 --> 11:03.193
All right, Jerry, are you familiar
with the <i>Kama Sutra</i> ?

11:03.362 --> 11:04.920
-No.
-Tantric yoga.

11:05.097 --> 11:08.430
-No.
-Jerry, you stand on the threshold...

11:08.601 --> 11:11.161
...to the magical world
of sensual delights...

11:11.337 --> 11:14.329
...that most men dare not dream of.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.865
Boy, you can really talk some trash.

11:17.043 --> 11:19.341
I guess that's better than eating it.

11:21.580 --> 11:25.346
All right, why don't we just watch
the tape, huh?

11:26.619 --> 11:29.144
-Did you pass your stone yet?
-Not yet.

11:29.622 --> 11:32.284
But the suspense is killing me.

11:32.458 --> 11:34.790
-Hey, that's her.
-Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, that's her.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.394
Look at the height, Jerry,
the extension.

11:37.563 --> 11:40.464
Watch the tuck,
handstand, half turn...

11:40.633 --> 11:43.158
...giant into a straddle,
back into another handstand...

11:43.335 --> 11:45.496
...nice kip, reverse hecht.

11:45.671 --> 11:47.730
Nice leg extension. Good form.

11:47.907 --> 11:50.375
Here comes the big dismount.
Look at the rotation.

11:50.543 --> 11:54.377
Full in, double back,
and she sticks the landing.

11:59.652 --> 12:01.916
Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape.

12:02.888 --> 12:05.186
I'll take that as a yes.

12:09.195 --> 12:10.423
Well, here we are.

12:11.397 --> 12:14.525
Yes, we are here.

12:15.701 --> 12:19.899
How did you stay on that beam
like that? It's only this wide.

12:20.506 --> 12:23.532
I can balance myself in any position.

12:26.312 --> 12:31.113
It is amazing, after years of training,
how one can contort one's body.

12:31.283 --> 12:36.118
Of course, it is only useful
in gymnastics.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.784
Oh, boy.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.625
I couldn't believe it.
I thought I was entering...

12:46.799 --> 12:49.563
...a magical world
of sensual delights.

12:49.735 --> 12:54.502
It was just so ordinary.
There was nothing gymnastic about it.

12:55.341 --> 12:57.036
What did you think
she was going to do?

12:57.610 --> 13:00.773
You know, I mean.... I don't know.

13:01.847 --> 13:03.508
No, what?

13:04.083 --> 13:07.814
-Obviously, I prefer not mention any--
-Did you think she was gonna take...

13:07.987 --> 13:11.650
-...some of that chalk and--
-I really don't wanna get into it.

13:12.224 --> 13:15.159
-Oh, come on. One thing.
-You know, any kind of specifics.

13:15.327 --> 13:17.158
One thing. What?

13:17.997 --> 13:24.402
Well, frankly, I thought, you know,
I was gonna be like the apparatus.

13:27.940 --> 13:29.669
You mean like
the uneven parallel bars?

13:29.842 --> 13:32.037
-Again, I don't feel like--
-The balance beam?

13:32.211 --> 13:35.578
-Could we stop?
-Not the pommel horse.

13:37.883 --> 13:39.316
Let's just drop it.

13:41.020 --> 13:43.215
So let me ask you this.
How long would you say...

13:43.389 --> 13:47.826
...I have to put in now
because of, you know, last night?

13:47.993 --> 13:51.190
-I don't know, at least three weeks.
-Oh, great.

13:51.363 --> 13:53.331
Jerry, that is such small potatoes.

13:53.499 --> 13:57.026
I think that I may have
single-handedly put the kibosh...

13:57.203 --> 14:00.536
-...on the big water merger.
-Between Poland and Morgan?

14:00.706 --> 14:03.106
Yeah. Started a big
name controversy.

14:05.077 --> 14:06.942
Kramer. The stone.

14:10.082 --> 14:11.743
What happened?
Did you pass the stone?

14:11.917 --> 14:16.081
No, I tried to do a reverse hecht
off my couch, and I didn't make it.

14:25.197 --> 14:27.392
You call this coffee?

14:28.033 --> 14:30.024
Hey!

14:30.703 --> 14:32.068
What the hell was that?

14:33.305 --> 14:35.432
-I'm terribly sorry.
-Clean that up!

14:35.608 --> 14:37.735
Oh, sure. Of course.

14:39.011 --> 14:41.502
Could you hold these
for just a second?

14:43.582 --> 14:45.482
Here you go.
Don't worry about a thing.

14:45.651 --> 14:49.553
It's gonna be fine.
Here we go. Look at this shine.

14:56.996 --> 14:59.157
Look at this sparkle.

15:02.334 --> 15:05.167
Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!

15:06.171 --> 15:07.763
Mrs. Enright!

15:09.041 --> 15:13.978
Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled
coffee on the gentleman's windshield.

15:15.147 --> 15:18.275
Why would I do that? I have a job.

15:18.951 --> 15:21.385
Well, did she see a squeegee?

15:22.755 --> 15:26.054
You're not gonna make
a dime without a squeegee.

15:26.625 --> 15:30.925
That's right. Just tell your mother
it was all a big misunderstanding.

15:31.096 --> 15:32.825
You won't regret it.

15:32.998 --> 15:35.330
Okay, I'll see you later.

15:35.734 --> 15:37.599
Bye-bye.

15:38.570 --> 15:40.595
Strike two.

15:42.308 --> 15:45.607
-You think I'm going down?
-You're behind in the count.

15:46.512 --> 15:50.471
-Hey, what are you doing later?
-Going out with Katya, thanks to you.

15:50.649 --> 15:53.083
Well, you know,
maybe you should try again.

15:53.252 --> 15:57.814
You know what happens the first time.
People are a little shy, a little reticent.

15:57.990 --> 16:01.517
If I do it again, that extends
my payment book another two weeks.

16:02.127 --> 16:03.617
-Where are you going?
-The circus.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.855
One of her old Olympic teammates
is an acrobat.

16:06.031 --> 16:10.559
-I don't even feel like going out.
-Jerry, it's your obligation, come on.

16:10.736 --> 16:13.569
Yeah, well, if I gotta go
and spend time with this girl...

16:13.739 --> 16:15.536
...you're coming with me,
Dr. Cyclops.

16:15.708 --> 16:18.734
-No, I don't wanna go to the circus.
-Yeah? Well, you're going.

16:18.911 --> 16:21.209
But I'm afraid of clowns.

16:24.583 --> 16:27.518
I didn't send you over there
to complain about the name.

16:27.686 --> 16:30.985
I couldn't help it. Moland Springs?

16:31.156 --> 16:32.953
I like the name Moland.

16:33.125 --> 16:34.649
I picked it out.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.159
After all those months
of negotiating.

16:37.329 --> 16:40.890
-Well, I'm so sorry.
-Well, I'm going riding.

16:41.433 --> 16:44.334
I haven't been on Jenny
for three days.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.233
All because of this blasted painting.

16:47.773 --> 16:50.037
-Elaine?
-Oh, sorry.

16:52.211 --> 16:53.678
Hello.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.042
Wait a minute.

16:57.216 --> 16:58.877
Wait a minute.

17:15.233 --> 17:17.395
So, Jerry,
you're enjoying the circus?

17:17.736 --> 17:19.431
Greatest show on earth.

17:19.905 --> 17:22.464
My father used to take me
to the circus.

17:22.641 --> 17:26.406
When the elephants came by,
he would scream curses at them...

17:26.578 --> 17:30.173
...blaming them for all the ills
of society.

17:31.583 --> 17:34.245
Well, they certainly take up
a lot of space.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.788
-Misha.
-Katya.

17:38.490 --> 17:40.390
Misha, this is Jerry.

17:41.093 --> 17:43.323
Yes, the comedian.

17:51.503 --> 17:53.767
Oh, yes. Yes, I'll tell him.
Yes, thank you.

17:53.939 --> 17:55.600
Hold on, hold on. Mr. Pitt?

17:55.774 --> 17:57.002
I think I'm on to something.

17:57.176 --> 17:59.303
Mr. Pitt, the board of directors
is on the phone.

17:59.478 --> 18:01.036
They've called
an emergency meeting.

18:01.213 --> 18:03.078
You need to be there
to discuss the merger.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.808
You said keep your eyes out of focus,
which is misleading.

18:05.984 --> 18:07.713
You want deep focus.

18:07.886 --> 18:11.083
Yes, hi, okay. Fine. Yeah.
Hold on just a second. Let me just--

18:11.557 --> 18:13.548
Yeah, I've got it--

18:16.195 --> 18:17.958
Yeah, he'll be there.

18:18.197 --> 18:22.258
Mr. Pitt, you have got to stop
staring at that poster!

18:22.434 --> 18:26.165
I see something that could be a
spaceship. Is it round? Is it pointed?

18:26.338 --> 18:29.432
No! You don't see it,
and you're never gonna see it!

18:30.008 --> 18:33.603
Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the
shareholders. You have to leave now.

18:33.779 --> 18:37.146
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?

18:38.884 --> 18:40.875
My goodness.
What's happened to me?

18:41.053 --> 18:42.884
-When's the meeting?
-In about 20 minutes.

18:44.089 --> 18:45.454
Do I have time to change?

18:46.358 --> 18:47.985
-No.
-Well, excuse me.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.025
I better get straight over there.

18:50.996 --> 18:52.623
-Mr. Pitt--
-Yes?

18:53.132 --> 18:55.532
-There's a--
-Is that ink?

18:56.368 --> 18:58.302
No.

19:02.207 --> 19:05.335
Well, here we are.

19:07.513 --> 19:10.676
Do you wanna come in?
My mother's having a little party.

19:11.150 --> 19:14.586
-Maybe I could just use the bathroom.
-Sure.

19:16.321 --> 19:19.848
Ladies and gentlemen, may I direct
your attention to the center ring...

19:20.025 --> 19:22.585
...where the incomparable Misha
will balance 10 stories...

19:22.761 --> 19:27.027
...above the circus floor on a wire
no wider than a human thumb.

19:27.933 --> 19:29.230
It is time.

19:31.103 --> 19:33.162
Break a leg.

19:33.572 --> 19:36.132
-Show biz.
-Ladies and gentlemen...

19:36.308 --> 19:39.175
...the incomparable Misha!

19:41.079 --> 19:43.172
Those capes
are really coming back.

19:46.785 --> 19:51.017
Sorry I took so long. They've got
one of those 3-D art posters in there.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.919
It's mesmerizing.

20:28.193 --> 20:30.184
What is that sound?

20:30.395 --> 20:32.226
It is horrible.

20:55.754 --> 20:58.780
Anybody see that poster in there?
That is weird, wild stuff, huh?

21:13.138 --> 21:15.902
I have been accused
of wrongdoing...

21:16.375 --> 21:20.175
...but these false accusations
will not deter us.

21:20.345 --> 21:24.475
We will annex Poland by the spring
at any cost!

21:24.850 --> 21:28.650
And our stock will rise high.

21:39.798 --> 21:42.699
The doctor said Misha
is going to be all right.

21:42.868 --> 21:44.893
I must go and be with Misha now.

21:45.070 --> 21:47.868
-I don't want you to come with me.
-Why not?

21:48.040 --> 21:50.770
It has been three days
since our night together.

21:50.942 --> 21:54.571
Misha said that was all the time
I needed to put in.

21:56.248 --> 21:59.046
-Really?
-In my country...

21:59.217 --> 22:01.913
...they speak of a man so virile,
so potent...

22:02.087 --> 22:05.250
...that to spend a night
with such a man is to enter a world...

22:05.424 --> 22:09.690
...of sensual delights
most women dare not dream of.

22:10.295 --> 22:12.923
This man is known
as the comedian.

22:14.800 --> 22:20.204
You may tell jokes, Mr. Jerry Seinfeld,
but you are no comedian.
