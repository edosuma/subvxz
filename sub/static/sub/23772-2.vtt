WEBVTT

00:05.480 --> 00:07.590
- Are you avoiding me?
- No, why?

00:07.640 --> 00:10.190
A lot of people's shoelaces seem
to come untied when I'm around,

00:10.240 --> 00:12.350
even if they're wearing slip-ons.

00:12.400 --> 00:15.150
Look, I just don't want to start
the day with a load of grief about

00:15.200 --> 00:18.270
Mimi being placed with
Martin instead of you.

00:18.320 --> 00:20.070
- All right, Cliff?
- Hello.

00:20.120 --> 00:23.190
I mean, surely you must be used
to not getting the girl by now.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.950
Why do you imagine I'm such
a failure with da ladies?

00:26.000 --> 00:29.990
Maybe because you keep using
words like "da ladies".

00:30.040 --> 00:32.150
Maybe it's a good thing,
that I'm not with Mimi,

00:32.200 --> 00:34.310
because office romances
are unprofessional.

00:34.360 --> 00:37.350
You haven't got a chance. She
says you have a dandruff problem.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.630
A, don't listen in to
people's private conversations.

00:39.680 --> 00:41.270
B, what the hell are you doing in there.

00:41.320 --> 00:42.950
- I'm...
- C, it's not dandruff.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.870
I just run my fingers
through my hair sometimes

00:44.920 --> 00:45.910
when I'm eating crisps.

00:45.960 --> 00:47.550
And it was pickled onion Monster Munch.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.350
It's a nightmare, because I had to
shampoo twice to get the stink out.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.350
I hope that's on your dating profile.

00:52.400 --> 00:53.470
Are you coming, Nat?

00:53.520 --> 00:56.030
Yeah. Can't find the
missing files in there.

00:56.080 --> 00:58.630
I thought you said they were
missing from the computer system.

00:58.680 --> 01:01.030
- Yes. - So, why would
they be in the recycling?

01:01.080 --> 01:02.710
Well, I've looked everywhere else.

01:02.760 --> 01:06.110
They were sent to be digitized,
weren't they, when we did the move?

01:06.160 --> 01:09.590
So, maybe they've been sent here by
mistake and they've been turfed out.

01:09.640 --> 01:12.110
A lot of stuff comes here by
mistake and should be turfed out.

01:12.160 --> 01:13.990
There's not going to
be anything interesting

01:14.040 --> 01:15.230
in them, though, is there?

01:15.280 --> 01:17.470
- They're pre-war.
- They're 1980s.

01:17.520 --> 01:19.230
Yeah. Pre-Iraq war.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.870
That's what pre-war means, isn't it?

01:20.920 --> 01:22.390
Yeah.

01:22.440 --> 01:23.510
She's got to go.

01:25.360 --> 01:27.150
Elm Heath Children's Services.

01:27.200 --> 01:31.200
Very, very young boys have just put
a sausage through my letterbox.

01:31.440 --> 01:33.710
Oh, how very strange.

01:33.760 --> 01:37.760
Well, I was wondering if you think
it's safe to eat the sausage.

01:37.840 --> 01:38.990
Oh, if it were me...

01:39.040 --> 01:41.510
Oh, I want one of those. Nice to
see you here with time to spare.

01:41.560 --> 01:45.070
One of the pluses of Lee lying
around house like a beached whale,

01:45.120 --> 01:49.120
is that I get out early in
the morning and I stay later.

01:49.520 --> 01:53.520
That's Rose. Rose there, and today,
she's turned up early and eager,

01:55.880 --> 01:59.550
as opposed to late and nearly dead.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.150
So we've put that there.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.510
'Hello.

02:02.560 --> 02:05.630
I'd like to purchase some breast milk.

02:05.680 --> 02:07.310
Breast Milk Man's back.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.070
Uh, Nitin, predictable.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.070
What's the point of being
boring? But he's not.

02:11.120 --> 02:12.470
He's not. A very interesting guy.

02:12.520 --> 02:15.470
Got it. I won an eBay bid on my TV.

02:15.520 --> 02:17.270
What about Caitlin
giving that back to you,

02:17.320 --> 02:18.830
on account that it's actually yours.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.470
Yeah, she's been saying that for ages.

02:20.520 --> 02:21.670
It's never going to happen.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.390
So I thought I'd pick one up second-hand,

02:23.440 --> 02:24.830
found she'd listed it.

02:24.880 --> 02:26.950
So you paid for your own TV?

02:27.000 --> 02:28.790
Yeah, but now I don't
have to confront her.

02:28.840 --> 02:31.670
You're going to have to confront
her when you go pick up the TV.

02:31.720 --> 02:34.350
Shit, I hadn't thought of that.

02:34.400 --> 02:37.350
- Will you do it for me?
- No fucking way.

02:37.400 --> 02:41.400
I've only met her once. I
still get the night terrors.

02:42.520 --> 02:46.350
Good morning, Ingrid.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.110
Sean, you can't just turn up here.

02:48.160 --> 02:50.790
You have to make an appointment.
You know that. What are you doing?

02:50.840 --> 02:52.510
You're not playing truant again, are you?

02:52.560 --> 02:53.990
No. Look, I've got a meeting today,

02:54.040 --> 02:56.230
and the school are trying to exclude me.

02:56.280 --> 02:58.310
Can you just come in
and talk them out of it?

02:58.360 --> 03:01.110
Why can't your mum go...?

03:01.160 --> 03:02.590
Sorry, your dad.

03:02.640 --> 03:06.190
She's still my mum. She just
wants me to call her dad.

03:06.240 --> 03:10.240
Well, he identifies as male, so
that's what I have to call him.

03:11.640 --> 03:13.830
Why isn't he going to the meeting?

03:13.880 --> 03:16.030
Oh, he doesn't know about it, does he?

03:16.080 --> 03:19.630
All right, so, why are you being excluded?

03:19.680 --> 03:22.190
- Fighting. - Because of what
the other kids are saying?

03:22.240 --> 03:25.470
- Sort of. - Well, you know he's going
to find out about it, don't you?

03:25.520 --> 03:28.590
Not if you come in and
convince them to let me stay.

03:28.640 --> 03:30.630
Can't you just ignore them? I don't know.

03:30.680 --> 03:31.910
No, I can't.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.070
If I could, I wouldn't be here, Al.

03:34.120 --> 03:36.430
Well, just keep your hands in your pocket.

03:36.480 --> 03:38.230
You don't have to lamp them all.

03:38.280 --> 03:41.070
All right, Ing. Limahl settling in OK?

03:41.120 --> 03:43.990
Oh, a bit of an adjustment
period, but I tell you what,

03:44.040 --> 03:46.390
I brought in his welcome cake.

03:46.440 --> 03:48.070
I thought everyone might like a piece.

03:48.120 --> 03:50.430
- He made that?
- No, I made it for him.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.590
He looked on appreciatively.

03:52.640 --> 03:55.790
I have cut off the bit of icing
where he stubbed out his cigarette.

03:55.840 --> 03:57.830
Oh, um, lovely.

03:57.880 --> 04:01.470
Sorry, do these hairy old ears
deceive me, but a cigarette?

04:01.520 --> 04:03.550
He's 14, isn't he? He
shouldn't be smoking.

04:03.600 --> 04:05.550
That's what I said to him

04:05.600 --> 04:07.790
and that's why he stubbed out
the cigarette in the cake.

04:07.840 --> 04:11.830
- What can you do? - God, Ben Evans
has fallen off the wagon again.

04:11.880 --> 04:14.510
PC Harris took him home
last night with a caution

04:14.560 --> 04:16.790
for urinating in a hanging basket.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.190
Was he underneath it?

04:18.240 --> 04:20.029
That's genuinely impressive.

04:20.079 --> 04:22.710
- It doesn't say.
- I think you should pop round there.

04:22.760 --> 04:24.510
Why? To find out where he pissed from?

04:24.560 --> 04:27.150
No, to see if his kids are all right.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.590
Isn't that a bit of
phlegm on the edge there?

04:29.640 --> 04:31.350
Oh, yes, I think it might be.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.350
Yes, I'll go and wipe it off.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.430
No, don't wipe it. Cut it out.

04:35.480 --> 04:38.390
Chuck it out. He's probably
jizzed into the middle of it.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.230
Speaking from experience?

04:40.280 --> 04:41.950
Yeah, I've been caught by that before.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.870
I meant you've done it, not eaten it.

04:43.920 --> 04:45.470
I didn't get on with one of my brothers.

04:45.520 --> 04:46.670
Do you remember Sean Atkins?

04:46.720 --> 04:48.710
- Yeah. - Mum with plums,
or whatever you call a woman

04:48.760 --> 04:50.030
who wants to be a man.

04:50.080 --> 04:54.080
Nitin. For fuck's sake.

04:54.320 --> 04:56.950
Well, you just swore in front of a
client, though, so that's worse,

04:57.000 --> 04:59.350
and no-one could accuse
me of being transphobic.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.310
Apart from anyone who knows you.

05:01.360 --> 05:05.360
Walk over there in a non-phobic way.

05:05.600 --> 05:09.600
Phobic.

05:10.400 --> 05:13.070
- Sean, I...
- Phobic.

05:13.120 --> 05:17.120
Sean, I apologise for using
inappropriate terminology.

05:17.240 --> 05:21.110
I've had worse, but say that
again, and I will fuck you up.

05:21.160 --> 05:23.030
Well, now he's sworn. You both swore,

05:23.080 --> 05:24.510
and that cancels out what I said.

05:24.560 --> 05:25.990
If only there were two of you,

05:26.040 --> 05:28.110
and then you could cancel each other out.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.670
He's about to be excluded for fighting.

05:30.720 --> 05:32.670
- You could probably tell.
- Yeah, Sean, it,

05:32.720 --> 05:34.990
it might be a good idea
to start off somewhere new

05:35.040 --> 05:37.390
where the kids know your dad as your dad,

05:37.440 --> 05:39.230
rather than someone
that used to be your mum.

05:39.280 --> 05:41.590
That's letting ignorant people win.

05:41.640 --> 05:43.750
They always do. Look at Brexit.

05:43.800 --> 05:46.350
I mean, I just had an e-mail
from the Kowalskis, right?

05:46.400 --> 05:48.110
They've gone back to Poland

05:48.160 --> 05:50.670
because some idiot Tippexed a swastika

05:50.720 --> 05:53.150
on the back of Tommy's fucking wheelchair.

05:53.200 --> 05:56.150
I mean, Nigel Farage should
have his nose hair ripped out

05:56.200 --> 05:59.590
and fashioned into tiny cudgels
to beat Boris Johnson with.

05:59.640 --> 06:03.070
Uh, I think ripping out Mr Farage's
pubics would be a better option.

06:09.160 --> 06:13.160
Nat, can you tell Denise to take
the Kowalskis off the Strat agenda?

06:13.760 --> 06:15.790
They've left the country.

06:15.840 --> 06:19.070
- Gone anywhere nice?
- No, it's not a holiday.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.670
Oh, it's all right. I'll do, I'll do it.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.270
I'm off to Evan's nightmare.

06:22.320 --> 06:24.230
But it is quite near that big Tesco's.

06:24.280 --> 06:26.990
Can you nip in there
and get a decent cake?

06:27.040 --> 06:29.350
I don't fancy Ing's.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.150
No. No, thanks.

06:31.200 --> 06:35.200
If you don't, I'll tell Denise that
you insulted a transgender client

06:36.280 --> 06:39.750
in front of their son, so just do it.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.510
What do you want, then, one
of those Peppa Pig ones?

06:42.560 --> 06:46.560
- Yeah, Peppa Pig.
- Yeah, Peppa Pig is fine.

06:47.320 --> 06:50.110
I'm going to argue that
it'll cause you more distress

06:50.160 --> 06:52.350
to go to a referral unit.

06:52.400 --> 06:55.830
It's unhelpful cos of what
you're going through at home.

06:55.880 --> 06:59.350
- Thanks for this.
- Nah, it's all right, it's my job.

06:59.400 --> 07:03.190
- For now. - What, are
you thinking of changing?

07:03.240 --> 07:06.230
- Maybe.
- What else could you do?

07:06.280 --> 07:08.510
It's a pretty transferable skill.

07:08.560 --> 07:11.350
Yeah, but it's tough for old people.

07:11.400 --> 07:14.190
I'm older than you, but
I'm not old people.

07:14.240 --> 07:17.430
You're about as old as my dad,
and he can't find anything.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.870
He's been stressing about
that more than the op.

07:19.920 --> 07:22.910
And the rent keeps going
up, the TV packed in.

07:22.960 --> 07:24.750
I thought your generation didn't watch TV.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.990
I thought it was all phones and tablets.

07:27.040 --> 07:30.390
Like I can afford an iPad.

07:30.440 --> 07:33.590
Denise, the, uh, Kowalskis...

07:33.640 --> 07:35.470
Hiya, hello.

07:35.520 --> 07:36.710
Do you two know each other?

07:36.760 --> 07:38.790
He queue-jumped me in
the pub the other night.

07:38.840 --> 07:40.830
And I bought you a drink
to make up for it.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.830
Oh, yes, and it was lovely, thank you.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.670
Yeah, I don't think I caught your name.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.390
- I'm, I'm Rose.
- Dennis.

07:46.440 --> 07:47.910
How do you two know each other?

07:47.960 --> 07:50.230
- He's my brother.
- I didn't know you had a brother.

07:50.280 --> 07:53.430
- Why would you? - Oh, it might
have popped up in conversation.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.030
We don't have conversations.

07:55.080 --> 07:58.270
We have exchanges of
professionally relevant information.

07:58.320 --> 07:59.350
She was like this as a kid.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.510
I used to get memos as a birthday card.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.150
Thank you, Dennis. Is that it?

08:03.200 --> 08:06.270
- Is that all you needed?
- Dennis and Denise?

08:07.720 --> 08:09.190
Who's named after who?

08:09.240 --> 08:12.790
Rose, if I had a pound for every
tedious comment about our names,

08:12.840 --> 08:15.790
I'd have enough to pay your
redundancy out of my own pocket.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.910
Don't worry, you caught
her at a bad moment.

08:17.960 --> 08:18.990
- Her 50s.
- Do you want these

08:19.040 --> 08:20.990
or will you be moving
out to a hotel tonight?

08:21.040 --> 08:23.750
Oh, come on, Stinker, I'm just
trying to lighten the mood.

08:23.800 --> 08:24.870
I'll get back to work.

08:24.920 --> 08:26.350
Yes, which is a first for you.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.470
Professionally, she admires me, really.

08:28.520 --> 08:29.510
I just wanted to say

08:29.560 --> 08:31.590
that the Kowalskis won't
be coming to the meeting.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.390
They've gone back to Poland,

08:33.440 --> 08:35.909
they said they just don't
feel welcome here any more.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.789
Thank you, and talking of being
welcome, that will be all.

08:38.840 --> 08:40.830
Shall I Brexit?

08:40.880 --> 08:42.590
Listen, give me your number.

08:42.640 --> 08:45.030
- I owe you a drink.
- Oh, OK.

08:45.080 --> 08:46.910
You said you already bought her one.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.910
Well, I'm going to get her another one.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.270
I've been out of the
country for a few years,

08:51.320 --> 08:52.990
and I don't know many people.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.990
Oh, well, as long as "out of the country"

08:55.040 --> 08:57.190
isn't a euphemism for prison.

08:57.240 --> 08:59.270
No, I've been in Canada, where, obviously,

08:59.320 --> 09:00.820
I was serving time for murder.

09:05.560 --> 09:07.830
- Give me your phone.
- No!

09:07.880 --> 09:09.310
Do not phone that woman.

09:09.360 --> 09:13.360
- Why not?
- She has appalling hygiene.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.670
- Dennis.
- Hello, is that Rose?

09:15.720 --> 09:18.910
Dennis, it's not funny.

09:18.960 --> 09:22.960
Sorry, I'm late. Found a
13-year-old with condoms in his bag.

09:23.680 --> 09:27.670
Said he was using them for water bombs.

09:27.720 --> 09:29.630
Probably shouldn't have shared that,

09:29.680 --> 09:33.350
but, uh, it's been one of those days.

09:33.400 --> 09:34.910
Who are you?

09:34.960 --> 09:37.510
- Where's your dad?
- I'm Al Kavanagh.

09:37.560 --> 09:40.510
I was Sean's social
worker when his dad le...

09:40.560 --> 09:44.560
Biological dad left, so,
it's before your time.

09:45.360 --> 09:49.360
And, Sean's dad, as we
now know him, where's he?

09:49.520 --> 09:53.430
Sean hasn't told his dad
about the possible exclusion.

09:53.480 --> 09:57.480
His dad's going through
a difficult time...

09:58.040 --> 10:01.550
.. emotionally, with the process of
transitioning and also financially,

10:01.600 --> 10:05.310
and Sean feels guilty, and he
doesn't want to add to that.

10:05.360 --> 10:09.360
So, I'm just here to ask you
to give him another chance.

10:11.720 --> 10:13.670
Well, I'm very sorry to hear all of that,

10:13.720 --> 10:16.710
but I can't tolerate
violence between pupils.

10:16.760 --> 10:19.270
No, and, of course, I appreciate
that, but, but, equally,

10:19.320 --> 10:22.910
Sean shouldn't have to put
up with insensitive taunts

10:22.960 --> 10:26.710
and provocations from
the other kids and...

10:26.760 --> 10:29.670
Sean's classmates have
actually been very supportive,

10:29.720 --> 10:32.070
and the ones that haven't
been have been kept in check

10:32.120 --> 10:34.230
by the rest of the class, and by me.

10:34.280 --> 10:37.110
Sean's being excluded for
hitting another pupil

10:37.160 --> 10:41.160
who actually said how cool
his dad was for transitioning.

10:42.200 --> 10:46.200
That's not what you told me, Sean.

10:47.920 --> 10:49.270
Sean.

10:49.320 --> 10:52.150
Sean! OK, right.

10:52.200 --> 10:56.200
- I can't have this.
- That's enough.

10:57.880 --> 10:59.310
Uh, no, John T.

10:59.360 --> 11:01.110
Come on.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.510
Hi, do you remember me?

11:03.560 --> 11:05.310
Oh, God, sorry, yeah.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.550
Um, there you go.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.190
- What's that for?
- You brought the take away last night?

11:10.240 --> 11:12.790
- I didn't have enough
change for a tip. - Wow.

11:12.840 --> 11:16.350
In 2017. That wasn't me.

11:16.400 --> 11:17.590
Where do I know you from, then?

11:17.640 --> 11:20.510
Your wife left a baby in the
supermarket three months ago.

11:20.560 --> 11:23.790
Oh, yeah. I remember you
tried and failed to detain us

11:23.840 --> 11:26.150
under your Stalinesque bureaucracy.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.270
Shit. Fuck.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.710
- Have you been drinking?
- I don't have to answer that.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.230
- Oh, Christ, no.
- There you go.

11:32.280 --> 11:33.390
We've got a problem here.

11:33.440 --> 11:34.550
This is a living hell.

11:34.600 --> 11:37.870
- You're not coping.
- Are you just going to stand there?

11:37.920 --> 11:39.790
I mean, she helped. I don't even know her.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.430
You've got that harness too tight.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.350
Oh, you're a harness expert, are you?

11:43.400 --> 11:45.750
I thought you were an
expert in being annoying.

11:45.800 --> 11:48.230
- Where's your wife?
- Search me.

11:48.280 --> 11:49.750
Living in a ditch, hopefully.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.710
You've got way too many clothes on her.

11:51.760 --> 11:53.350
- Him.
- He's sweating.

11:53.400 --> 11:54.550
You're as bad as she was.

11:54.600 --> 11:55.990
Now it's too hot, now it's too cold,

11:56.040 --> 11:57.550
don't leave him in the bath on his own.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.550
- OK, you're coming with me.
- Like fuck, I am.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.910
All right, maybe then I'll
just slap a section 47 on you.

12:01.960 --> 12:03.670
You're a lawyer. You know what that means.

12:03.720 --> 12:05.150
I'm a corporate lawyer.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.990
It's part of the 1989 Children Act.

12:07.040 --> 12:08.270
Guarantees an investigation

12:08.320 --> 12:10.590
if the child's welfare is
considered to be at risk.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.550
Maybe you should ask one
the lawyers at your firm

12:12.600 --> 12:15.150
to explain further. I'm
sure they'd love to be able.

12:15.200 --> 12:18.790
Fine. Last time you took John T
away from us for a couple of hours.

12:18.840 --> 12:22.840
Could do with a break.

12:23.680 --> 12:25.700
Oh, look, it's The Incredible Sulk.

12:26.540 --> 12:29.650
For fuck's sake, I'm too
sick and tired of everyone

12:29.700 --> 12:30.850
trying to be understanding!

12:30.900 --> 12:32.890
- That's the fucking problem!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

12:32.940 --> 12:36.890
- So what are you saying now? People
are too understanding? - I don't know.

12:36.940 --> 12:39.450
It's just all these teachers
are spouting this modern therapy

12:39.500 --> 12:41.370
bullshit to show how much they care.

12:41.420 --> 12:43.930
And then the rest of the class
all trying to outdo each other

12:43.980 --> 12:45.450
to show how OK they are with it.

12:45.500 --> 12:48.730
I just feel like I'm not allowed
to feel pissed off about everything

12:48.780 --> 12:50.410
or freaked or angry.

12:50.460 --> 12:54.460
Is that how you feel, you
feel freaked and angry?

12:57.260 --> 13:00.530
I lost my dad when he walked out on us

13:00.580 --> 13:04.580
and now it feels like I'm
going to you lose my mum.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.690
- Come on.
- Sean.

13:09.740 --> 13:13.740
When I've had you in here
before, you've just clammed up.

13:14.260 --> 13:16.290
This is the first time
I'm hearing any of this.

13:16.340 --> 13:19.010
I just feel crap that I'm the only
person that seems to have a problem

13:19.060 --> 13:20.050
with all this.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.290
I fucking hate it, that's how I feel.

13:22.340 --> 13:25.290
- Can we just lose the swearing?
- Why the fuck should I?

13:25.340 --> 13:28.370
I'm out, aren't I? I'm not
excluded, I'm expelled!

13:28.420 --> 13:32.290
Well, maybe I didn't have
the full picture before.

13:32.340 --> 13:35.130
So, I am prepared to discuss
a probationary period

13:35.180 --> 13:36.410
with you and your dad.

13:36.460 --> 13:39.130
No, I don't want him to know.

13:39.180 --> 13:41.890
You should just say to your dad
everything that you've just said

13:41.940 --> 13:43.970
cos you're not saying you don't love him,

13:44.020 --> 13:46.050
you're not saying you don't support him.

13:46.100 --> 13:50.100
Why don't I give him a call?

13:51.860 --> 13:54.690
I heard something about a victim
of abuse at the football club.

13:54.740 --> 13:56.810
I'm just wondering why
that's not down here.

13:56.860 --> 13:59.850
- It's historic abuse and the
police are dealing with it. - Right.

13:59.900 --> 14:01.810
Don't get why they investigate.

14:01.860 --> 14:04.330
Surely if it's historic,
it happened, end of.

14:04.380 --> 14:08.090
I just wanted to asked before
Denise arrives... Don't note this.

14:08.140 --> 14:11.010
- I'm not, I'm playing hangman.
- Against yourself?

14:11.060 --> 14:13.490
Yeah, I'm really good at it.

14:13.540 --> 14:16.410
I don't try and guess the word,
cos obviously that's in my head.

14:16.460 --> 14:19.530
I just really love drawing the hanged man.

14:19.580 --> 14:21.650
Pretend it's an ex.

14:21.700 --> 14:25.170
Better than killing them, eh?

14:25.220 --> 14:28.330
I'm just wondering, Mimi, who
your choice would have been

14:28.380 --> 14:30.130
if Denise hadn't overruled you?

14:30.180 --> 14:32.050
Now, steady, Nitin.

14:32.100 --> 14:35.050
Sounds like you've got a mouth
full of rather sour grapes there.

14:35.100 --> 14:37.450
I don't like grapes, Martin.

14:37.500 --> 14:40.490
If it's any consolation, Nitin,
you did make the long list.

14:40.540 --> 14:43.770
The long list? There were
five of us in contention so...

14:43.820 --> 14:46.610
Exactly. So...

14:46.660 --> 14:48.970
OK, was it the dandruff cos
I can explain the dandruff?

14:49.020 --> 14:50.770
The fact is, that it's not dandruff.

14:50.820 --> 14:53.530
Oh, aside from the dandruff and
the long list of other issues,

14:53.580 --> 14:54.770
you have RDD.

14:54.820 --> 14:56.450
Is that a posh name for crabs?

14:56.500 --> 14:59.730
No, Responsibility Deficit Disorder.

14:59.780 --> 15:02.130
- What? - It's not
officially recognised yet.

15:02.180 --> 15:04.570
Theoretical stage, but you have it.

15:04.620 --> 15:08.570
Well, if it's not officially
recognised and it's theoretical

15:08.620 --> 15:11.410
then it doesn't exist,
so, I don't have it.

15:11.460 --> 15:15.250
Definitely have OCD. It can
be linked to Trichotillomania.

15:15.300 --> 15:18.570
- Trickle..?
- Hair-pulling disorder.

15:18.620 --> 15:20.850
It actually might explain the dandruff.

15:20.900 --> 15:23.370
There's no dandruff. There is no dandruff!

15:23.420 --> 15:25.010
It's crisps.

15:25.060 --> 15:27.890
Right, let's get on.

15:27.940 --> 15:30.090
Where's Alastair?

15:30.140 --> 15:31.810
The Atkins boy turned up.

15:31.860 --> 15:34.170
The father left leading
to behavioural issues,

15:34.220 --> 15:35.770
remaining parent transitioning?

15:35.820 --> 15:37.730
Yeah, he's got a few problems at school

15:37.780 --> 15:40.730
so Al's gone up there to try
and smooth things over before...

15:40.780 --> 15:42.650
OK, then will start with Nitin.

15:42.700 --> 15:46.010
- Ben Evans' relapse?
- Yeah, he's embarrassed and remorseful

15:46.060 --> 15:48.490
but he's committed to staying sober.

15:48.540 --> 15:51.370
- The kids are fine. The house
is clean-ish. - Meaning?

15:51.420 --> 15:54.690
The lid was off the butter tub and I
noticed there was some crumbs in it.

15:54.740 --> 15:56.850
I'm a neat freak. It's one of my bugbears.

15:56.900 --> 15:59.050
- Completely irrelevant, strike that.
- I hate that.

15:59.100 --> 16:03.100
Just strike it, strike it.

16:03.340 --> 16:06.610
Anyway, on my way back, I
popped into the supermarket

16:06.660 --> 16:09.210
- because you wanted a cake
which I forgot... - Oh.

16:09.260 --> 16:10.610
I bumped into Zach Stott.

16:10.660 --> 16:13.490
Remember the guy with the wife who
left the baby in the supermarket?

16:13.540 --> 16:17.540
- Posh boy. - Yeah, anyway, now his
wife has left him with the baby.

16:17.860 --> 16:20.370
How can a woman do that, abandon her baby?

16:20.420 --> 16:24.420
Let's not woman shame, Nat. No-one
ever blames a man for walking out.

16:24.540 --> 16:26.890
- They do.
- Not to the same degree.

16:26.940 --> 16:29.650
Women are conditioned to be care
givers so when a mother abandons

16:29.700 --> 16:32.770
her child they are seen as unnatural
beings which is totally unfair.

16:32.820 --> 16:34.530
Too right, girl power!

16:34.580 --> 16:38.530
Can we cut the vacuous
feminist chit-chat, please?

16:38.580 --> 16:39.850
Nitin, carry on.

16:39.900 --> 16:42.770
I brought him in cos he
seemed drunk and distraught,

16:42.820 --> 16:44.290
and not coping at all.

16:44.340 --> 16:46.690
The baby was overdressed and
too tight in the carrier.

16:46.740 --> 16:48.970
OK, Rose, speak to him.

16:49.020 --> 16:52.290
Why am I not being assigned
to this, cos I brought him in?

16:52.340 --> 16:55.290
- No, no, we need a senior on
this. Rose will do it. - Senior.

16:55.340 --> 16:57.770
Find out where the mother
is and set him straight.

16:57.820 --> 16:59.370
We're not here to pick up the pieces

16:59.420 --> 17:01.370
for people who can afford
to pay for themselves.

17:01.420 --> 17:03.050
The kid's called Jonty, by the way,

17:03.100 --> 17:05.010
which is grounds for
intervention in itself.

17:05.060 --> 17:07.369
Stupid names are just child cruelty.

17:07.420 --> 17:08.650
Jonty. Jonty.

17:08.700 --> 17:11.089
- Jonty? - Yeah. It's
his gran's intervention.

17:11.140 --> 17:13.250
John T?

17:13.300 --> 17:14.970
J-O-N-T-Y.

17:15.020 --> 17:17.810
- There was someone at our
school called Salome. - All right.

17:17.859 --> 17:20.609
I can tell by the smirks and the way
you're talking about stupid names

17:20.660 --> 17:23.329
that you've all been having
a great laugh at my expense.

17:23.380 --> 17:26.609
Sorry, I think you might be barking
up the wrong tree there, Denise.

17:26.660 --> 17:30.610
Did you just call me Dennis? I will
not tolerate such insubordination.

17:30.660 --> 17:32.050
Why would I do that?

17:32.100 --> 17:35.130
Because that's what Rose told
you my brother was called.

17:35.180 --> 17:39.180
Actually I didn't.

17:39.860 --> 17:42.410
I see, well. Then...

17:42.460 --> 17:44.370
.. apologies are due on both sides.

17:44.420 --> 17:46.050
Apologies are just due on one side

17:46.100 --> 17:48.730
because it was only you who falsely
accused everyone in the room.

17:48.780 --> 17:51.450
Do you want to have the world's
shortest placement or something?

17:51.500 --> 17:54.690
Denise, obviously there's only
one victim here and we apologise.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.650
Oh, shut up, Nitin, you obsequious turd!

17:57.700 --> 18:00.530
You should probably tell
Nat not to note that.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.730
I deliberately used the word obsequious

18:02.780 --> 18:05.250
- to stop that from happening.
- Good move, not a clue.

18:05.300 --> 18:06.610
This thing with your brother,

18:06.660 --> 18:10.660
is it something you'd like to
talk to me about in private...

18:11.500 --> 18:14.530
.. in a professional capacity?

18:14.580 --> 18:18.250
Was he the chap in here earlier
that asked for your number

18:18.300 --> 18:22.300
- because I can see...
- Meeting adjourned.

18:23.140 --> 18:25.170
It was the eyes.

18:25.220 --> 18:27.730
Rose and Denny sitting in a tree.

18:27.780 --> 18:30.970
H... S-H-A? G?G-G-I...

18:31.020 --> 18:33.210
- Fuck off, Nat.
- Yay.

18:33.260 --> 18:36.970
Top bants.

18:37.020 --> 18:40.290
- Children services, can I help?
- Dad won't let me shave.

18:40.340 --> 18:42.170
Your dad won't let you shave?

18:42.220 --> 18:44.930
- And I've got a tash.
- How old are you?

18:44.980 --> 18:47.610
- I'm eight.
- OK, what's your name?

18:47.660 --> 18:51.660
Elisha. All my friends
are making fun of me.

18:52.060 --> 18:53.850
- Thank God, can you take
over the rocking? - No.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.530
Fuck's sake, my arm's killing me!

18:56.660 --> 18:58.330
Oh, Jesus, I just got her down!

18:59.820 --> 19:02.730
- I've spoken to your wife.
- Where is she? - At a friend's.

19:02.780 --> 19:05.530
Which one? Is it Barbara?
Bet it's Barbara.

19:05.580 --> 19:08.410
She fucking hates me cos I made
a comment about her breast once

19:08.460 --> 19:10.210
and it was a compliment as well.

19:10.260 --> 19:13.010
So is she coming back now I've
learned my lesson about hard it is

19:13.060 --> 19:15.890
- to look after at kid?
- Look, she said she's exhausted.

19:15.940 --> 19:18.210
She just needs to get herself together.

19:18.260 --> 19:22.090
- Have you noticed how tired she is?
- We hardly see each other, you know.

19:22.140 --> 19:23.930
I've long hours, then I need to unwind.

19:23.980 --> 19:26.130
There's no point in me
going home straight away.

19:26.180 --> 19:28.290
- I'd be useless.
- You are fucking useless.

19:28.340 --> 19:30.930
Look, she could be suffering
from postnatal depression.

19:30.980 --> 19:34.010
Meanwhile, I'm suffering from her
suffering from postnatal depression.

19:34.060 --> 19:36.090
- Have you thought about counselling?
- Here we go.

19:36.140 --> 19:39.050
- I don't have a drink problem.
- I meant for your marriage.

19:39.100 --> 19:41.370
All I need from my marriage
is for my wife to be at home

19:41.420 --> 19:42.930
so I can go to work.

19:42.980 --> 19:45.850
I'm not saying that being a
mother isn't a job, but it isn't!

19:45.900 --> 19:48.610
Her being a mother isn't what pays
the mortgage. I pay the mortgage.

19:48.660 --> 19:51.130
That's on me and I can't
do it if I'm here.

19:51.180 --> 19:53.970
Cleaning shit off baby balls.
I need her to come back.

19:54.020 --> 19:57.330
All right, well, just let her
rest up and see how it goes.

19:57.380 --> 20:00.290
I think she just needs
some time away from you,

20:00.340 --> 20:04.340
as do we all.

20:04.940 --> 20:06.610
Please, please, don't cry.

20:08.300 --> 20:12.130
- Best to leave him with his dad.
- Yeah.

20:12.180 --> 20:15.370
Walk!

20:15.420 --> 20:18.450
- You'll let him stay though, yeah?
- Yeah, for a trial period.

20:18.500 --> 20:23.500
And, I'll tell his class mates
to lay off the tolerance.

20:24.180 --> 20:27.970
- I won't actually phrase it like that.
- Yeah, well...

20:28.020 --> 20:31.930
Listen, can I have your e-mail address?

20:31.980 --> 20:34.730
I... I'm just...

20:34.780 --> 20:38.780
I've got over a relationship
actually, a bad one.

20:38.980 --> 20:42.980
I was just going to suggest I could
keep you updated on Sean's progress.

20:44.300 --> 20:48.300
Yeah, I'll just type that in.

20:49.180 --> 20:52.050
You're really good with kids.

20:52.100 --> 20:54.090
Better than some of my staff.

20:54.140 --> 20:56.650
Well, I was thinking of a
career change, actually.

20:56.700 --> 20:59.170
Maybe teaching would be an option.

20:59.220 --> 21:01.170
It's tricky at your age.

21:01.220 --> 21:03.890
Yeah, right.

21:03.940 --> 21:07.940
I'm just going to pop to the toilet.
Dad asked if you could come back in.

21:08.060 --> 21:09.410
Sure.

21:09.460 --> 21:13.460
And maybe you could drop me a
line when you're over the bad one.

21:19.220 --> 21:20.810
All good?

21:20.860 --> 21:23.210
Yeah, I think so. Thanks.

21:23.260 --> 21:25.690
Yeah, no problem. Just doing my job.

21:25.740 --> 21:27.850
It doesn't look like I'm
going to get another one.

21:27.900 --> 21:31.900
I'm glad it's your job, else they
might not have let me stay, so...

21:32.220 --> 21:36.220
Well, look, best of luck.

21:39.820 --> 21:43.410
- Sean, hang on!
- I need a shit.

21:43.460 --> 21:46.690
Listen if you go here

21:46.740 --> 21:50.090
after school with your dad

21:50.140 --> 21:52.210
you can pick up a telly.

21:52.260 --> 21:56.260
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:56.620 --> 21:58.410
Don't you want the TV?

21:58.460 --> 22:02.010
No, I've bid on two by
mistake so I've got a spare.

22:02.060 --> 22:05.290
And I've dealt with that seller
before, so don't be offended

22:05.340 --> 22:09.340
if she talks to you like you just
pissed on her shoes. It's normal.

22:10.820 --> 22:14.820
OK.

22:15.500 --> 22:19.290
Right, I'm off. Thanks for
the cake. Helped myself.

22:19.340 --> 22:21.250
Don't thank me, thank Ingrid.

22:21.300 --> 22:24.290
Pretty good. I love a
bit of salted chocolate.

22:24.340 --> 22:27.050
I didn't put any salt in it.

22:27.100 --> 22:29.210
Ingrid, you need to bin that cake.

22:29.260 --> 22:31.810
And it sounds like you need
some support with Limahl.

22:31.860 --> 22:35.010
Oh, no, I'm fine. He just
sent me a picture actually.

22:35.060 --> 22:36.930
Seems to be having some sort of party.

22:36.980 --> 22:38.570
Then get home and chuck them out!

22:38.620 --> 22:40.370
It might be best to let it run its course.

22:40.420 --> 22:43.170
- I can go and eat in the cafe.
- Do you want me to go and kick them out?

22:43.220 --> 22:45.650
I haven't broken up a house
party since my time in blue.

22:45.700 --> 22:46.850
- Oh, would you mind?
- Sure.

22:46.900 --> 22:50.810
Think of it as payment in kind for
having that knob eat the wank cake.

22:50.860 --> 22:53.570
Must have been loads for the
taste to cut through though.

22:53.620 --> 22:55.810
Having said that, he's a teenager.

22:55.860 --> 22:57.530
I could go five in a row back in the day.

22:57.580 --> 22:59.970
- Wow!
- Not any more!

23:00.020 --> 23:03.250
Well, I suppose it's quality,
not quantity, isn't it?

23:03.300 --> 23:06.330
Well, the quality of the sex I'm having.

23:06.380 --> 23:08.130
Lots of intercourse.

23:08.180 --> 23:10.570
Oh, I thought maybe you had
a problem with your penis?

23:10.620 --> 23:12.050
No, no problem with my penis.

23:12.100 --> 23:16.100
♪ People, they ain't no good

23:18.660 --> 23:22.660
♪ I think that's well understood

23:25.420 --> 23:29.420
