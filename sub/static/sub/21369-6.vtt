♪♪

00:10.080 --> 00:13.170
Ooh, this tub is so dirty,
you could grow potatoes in it.

00:13.170 --> 00:15.670
Yeah. We should start
having the kids take showers

00:15.670 --> 00:18.120
before they take baths.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.540
What we should do is move that
toilet about two inches forward,

00:20.540 --> 00:22.620
so the boys actually
get somethin' in it.

00:25.330 --> 00:28.290
Hey, Rae...
is this a new toilet brush?

00:28.290 --> 00:30.250
-Why yes, it is.
-Oh!

00:30.250 --> 00:33.380
It's got a flex grip,
a curved handle,

00:33.380 --> 00:35.710
and two types of bristles
for dual-action cleaning.

00:36.920 --> 00:38.710
Well, this is amazing!

00:38.710 --> 00:43.710
(laughs) What-- Is it sad that
we're getting this excited

00:43.710 --> 00:45.120
about a new toilet brush?

00:46.290 --> 00:48.040
Booker: Mom, where do we
keep the extra butter?

00:48.040 --> 00:50.210
-Why?
-No reason.

00:52.290 --> 00:53.330
In the fridge, Booker.

00:53.330 --> 00:55.250
You the best!

00:55.250 --> 00:56.500
(clang)

00:58.210 --> 01:00.290
That boy needs a CAT scan.

01:03.210 --> 01:05.250
Chels, is this really our life?

01:05.250 --> 01:07.380
My son has his head
stuck in a pail,

01:07.380 --> 01:10.000
and we're on our hands and
knees scrubbin' the bathroom.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.330
It is Saturday. We
need to be havin' fun.

01:12.330 --> 01:16.290
Real fun.
We should go out!

01:16.290 --> 01:20.330
What do you mean, like "out" out?
Like, tiny purse out?

01:20.330 --> 01:24.040
Yeah. I'm talkin' about
fresh weave out.

01:24.040 --> 01:26.290
What?

01:26.290 --> 01:30.000
Now, I heard that up the street,
there's a new club called the Vault.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.290
-We should go.
-Yeah, we should go.

01:32.290 --> 01:33.290
-Mm-hm.
-I'll just call the sitter.

01:33.290 --> 01:35.670

(laughs) Right! Okay, great!
Great, thank you!

02:40.420 --> 02:44.380
(laughs) Bad news, Rae, we're
not goin' out tonight.

02:44.380 --> 02:46.330
Chelsea, you're serious?
No one's available to babysit?

02:46.330 --> 02:49.290
-No. -Man, I really
wanted to go out tonight.

02:49.290 --> 02:50.420
Mom, we don't need
a babysitter.

02:50.420 --> 02:51.920
We can stay by ourselves.

02:51.920 --> 02:54.620
Ha-ha! That's not gonna happen.

02:54.620 --> 02:55.750
But we're responsible.

02:55.750 --> 02:58.250
Nia, if it was just you,
sweetie, of course.

02:58.250 --> 03:00.420
You and Levi?
Why not?

03:00.420 --> 03:01.960
What if it was Nia,
Levi, and me?

03:01.960 --> 03:03.210
I'd think about it.

03:03.210 --> 03:04.920
Yo, Booker, I got an
"I'd think about it,"

03:04.920 --> 03:07.460
You got straight
shut down, son!

03:08.750 --> 03:11.790
Wait, I'm the reason
we can't stay home alone?

03:11.790 --> 03:14.830
I'm as responsible
as everybody else.

03:14.830 --> 03:18.330
You just had a pail
stuck on your head.

03:18.330 --> 03:20.420
Auntie Rae, you and Mom
deserve a night out.

03:20.420 --> 03:21.580
We can handle this.

03:21.580 --> 03:23.420
Yeah! We'll do it together.

03:23.420 --> 03:24.750
Plus, I'll be here, Ms. B.

03:24.750 --> 03:26.380
When are you not here, Tess?

03:27.880 --> 03:29.880
Please, give us a chance.

03:29.880 --> 03:32.330
Kids: Mmm?

03:32.330 --> 03:34.210
Mm.

03:34.210 --> 03:36.040
A moment in the kitchen?

03:36.040 --> 03:37.540
If that's not the name

03:37.540 --> 03:39.380
of a Michael Bublé album,

03:39.380 --> 03:40.750
it should be.

03:44.670 --> 03:46.080
What do you think, Chels?

03:46.080 --> 03:47.670
I think our kids
deserve a chance

03:47.670 --> 03:49.460
to prove they can
stay home alone.

03:49.460 --> 03:51.750
I don't think so, Chels.
You can't trust 'em.

03:51.750 --> 03:53.120
They're sneaky.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.960
I can't believe she said
we're sneaky!

03:54.960 --> 03:56.540
Be quiet! She'll hear us!

03:57.670 --> 03:59.500
Oh, come on, they're good kids.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.540
And, Rae, we need this.

04:02.540 --> 04:04.290
(sigh) All right, okay.

04:04.290 --> 04:06.250
I could ask Tess' Mom
to check in on them,

04:06.250 --> 04:08.500
and the club is only
four blocks away.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.580
Okay, wow. I can't believe

04:10.580 --> 04:12.540
I'm actually saying this,
but okay.

04:12.540 --> 04:14.120
We'll let the kids
stay home alone.

04:14.120 --> 04:17.620
(kids cheering)

04:20.580 --> 04:21.500
Yeah!

04:23.620 --> 04:27.540
Now how many times have I told you not
to eavesdrop on my conversations?

04:27.540 --> 04:30.210
Let's focus on what's
really important.

04:30.210 --> 04:32.460
(yelling)
We're stayin' home alone!

04:32.460 --> 04:34.580
(kids cheering)

04:36.920 --> 04:39.710
Chels, did we make
the right decision?

04:39.710 --> 04:43.120
Rae, if the Vault is lame,
we'll just go somewhere else.

04:44.380 --> 04:47.210
Oh, you mean about the kids?
Oh. I don't know.

04:52.380 --> 04:54.580
You guys! For the first
time in our 11 years

04:54.580 --> 04:56.960
on the planet,
we're gonna be home alone!

04:56.960 --> 05:00.170
I can't wait to find out
what's on TV after 9:00.

05:01.620 --> 05:04.250
Raven: I hope you're
not eating ice cream!

05:04.250 --> 05:06.500
'Cause it's about to get
hot in here.

05:09.040 --> 05:11.210
How do we look?

05:11.210 --> 05:13.040
Kinda trashy.

05:14.460 --> 05:16.580
Both:
Nailed it!

05:16.580 --> 05:17.670
Ahhh!

05:17.670 --> 05:19.120
All right, everybody,
listen up!

05:19.120 --> 05:22.790
Rules. Tess' mom is watchin' out
for you, so behave yourselves.

05:22.790 --> 05:25.830
Also! No cooking, no fighting,
no throwing, no running,

05:25.830 --> 05:27.670
-no hugging!
-Why no hugging?

05:27.670 --> 05:29.620
'Cause it always ends
in fightin'.

05:31.120 --> 05:32.830
Listen, don't
open the door for anybody,

05:32.830 --> 05:35.960
under no circumstances are
you allowed to leave this house,

05:35.960 --> 05:37.670
and you call us
if you need anything.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.500
Anything!

05:39.500 --> 05:43.120
(phone ringing)

05:43.120 --> 05:45.380
Yes, Tess?

05:45.380 --> 05:48.620
Heh. Just wanted to make sure
I had the right number.

05:50.540 --> 05:53.330
Mother, there is
no need to worry.

05:53.330 --> 05:55.500
We are all mature enough
to handle this.

05:55.500 --> 06:00.460
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off
to enjoy a sugar-free hard candy.

06:03.620 --> 06:05.750
Don't make me regret this.

06:05.750 --> 06:07.080
-Love you, Mom.
-Love you guys.

06:07.080 --> 06:08.750
-Have fun.
-Love you, Levi.

06:08.750 --> 06:10.580
-Love you, too.
-Mm-wah.

06:10.580 --> 06:12.040
-And remember...
-Yeah?

06:12.040 --> 06:14.540
You don't owe
anybody anything.

06:17.670 --> 06:20.080
Nia: Okay! Have a good time! Love you guys!
See you later!

06:20.080 --> 06:21.670
-Bye!
-Kids: Bye!

06:21.670 --> 06:24.000
Finally!
They're gone!

What are you doing? You can't
throw that in the house.

06:51.210 --> 06:52.750
But we're not allowed
to go outside.

06:52.750 --> 06:55.080
Yeah, what are we

You're gonna spill.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.290
What?

07:27.290 --> 07:29.670
I have to be honest.
If anyone was gonna spill,

07:29.670 --> 07:31.420
I thought it'd be you.

07:31.420 --> 07:32.960
Yeah, me too!

07:34.330 --> 07:36.290
Mom's gonna think
I did this!

07:36.290 --> 07:37.380
We have to fix it.

07:37.380 --> 07:39.670
Just flip the cushion.
They'll never know.

07:39.670 --> 07:40.750
Okay.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.420
Yeah, that's not gonna work,

07:45.420 --> 07:49.000
I had a small incident
with a chocolate bar last week.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.580
I'm just glad
that's chocolate.

07:52.040 --> 07:53.120
Don't worry.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.790
I got this.
I'll call my uncle.

07:55.790 --> 07:57.330
He knows
how to get any stain out.

07:57.330 --> 07:58.620
Even blood.

07:58.620 --> 08:01.290
Is your uncle a dry cleaner
or something like that?

08:01.290 --> 08:03.790
Yeah, somethin' like that.

08:07.380 --> 08:12.540
(club music playing)

08:18.000 --> 08:20.380
No, I'm gonna need
to see some ID.

08:20.380 --> 08:24.210
Oh, how cute. Cardin' us like
we're some sorority girls.

08:24.210 --> 08:26.120
-Oh...
-Thank you!

08:28.380 --> 08:29.460
I'm serious.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.620
Okay, gimme a second,
let me find it.

08:33.880 --> 08:38.210
Um... so I--
I don't have it.

08:39.750 --> 08:40.880
Then I can't let you in.

08:40.880 --> 08:42.170
There's mine, sir,

08:42.170 --> 08:43.790
and as you can see,
I am of age,

08:43.790 --> 08:45.710
so I will vouch for her.
(chuckles)

08:45.710 --> 08:47.040
All right.
You can get in.

08:47.040 --> 08:49.250
-Cool.
-Not you!

08:51.000 --> 08:52.790
You got a mama, don't you?

08:52.790 --> 08:54.620
Yes, I do.

08:54.620 --> 08:56.750
And you love your mama,
don't you?

08:56.750 --> 08:59.210
The woman's a saint.

08:59.210 --> 09:03.380
And if your mama wanted to just pop
it one good time at the club...

09:05.250 --> 09:06.710
would you let her in?

09:07.830 --> 09:09.120
If she had ID.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.000
Listen to me!
All right?

09:13.000 --> 09:17.040
I am a hard-working single mother.
I need this!

09:17.040 --> 09:20.830
Now, everything I got
is taped down, squeezed in,

09:20.830 --> 09:22.420
and pushed up!

09:22.420 --> 09:25.120
All right?
I'm gettin' in this club.

09:26.420 --> 09:27.750
(high-pitched)
Enjoy your night.

09:27.750 --> 09:28.750
Yeah, that's right.

09:30.210 --> 09:32.580
Come on, Rae, aah!

09:32.580 --> 09:33.790
Isn't this great?

09:33.790 --> 09:36.920
Oh! Finally a chance to be out
as adults, you know?

09:36.920 --> 09:38.920
Just you and me, havin' fun.

09:38.920 --> 09:40.790
Not talkin' about the kids.

09:40.790 --> 09:42.710
Girl, what kids?
We ain't got no kids!

09:42.710 --> 09:44.750
(both laughing)

09:44.750 --> 09:46.290
-Shall we call 'em?
-Yeah.

09:46.290 --> 09:48.420
-Let's go call 'em, and then
we can have some fun. -Okay.

09:50.790 --> 09:53.830
(phone ringing)

09:53.830 --> 09:55.540
-It's Mom!
-Pick it up!

09:55.540 --> 09:56.830
I'm not pickin' it up,
you pick it up!

09:56.830 --> 09:58.920
Fine, I'll get it. Gosh.

09:59.960 --> 10:03.170
No, don't hand me the--
hey, Mom.

10:03.170 --> 10:05.710
Hey, baby, how's it goin'?

10:05.710 --> 10:06.790
She knows!

10:09.620 --> 10:11.880
Uh, fine, fine,
perfectly fine, okay?

10:11.880 --> 10:13.460
-Just spillin'.
-Booker!

10:13.460 --> 10:15.960
I mean chillin'!

10:15.960 --> 10:17.620
Everything okay?
Let me talk to your sister.

10:17.620 --> 10:20.000
I wish you would.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.080
-Hey, Mom! -Hey, sweetie,
everything okay?

10:22.080 --> 10:24.000
Yup. Everything's fine.
Nothing happening here,

10:24.000 --> 10:25.790
-just hangin' out. -(dance
music plays over phone)

10:25.790 --> 10:27.880
Hey, is that your jam
they're playing?

10:27.880 --> 10:30.120
(dance music plays)

10:30.120 --> 10:31.960
That's my baby.
She got a good ear.

10:31.960 --> 10:34.830
-That is our jam. Okay, gotta go, bye!
-(both screaming)

10:36.830 --> 10:39.670
So, we got the stain out.

10:39.670 --> 10:42.170
Yeah, but then this happened.

10:43.920 --> 10:46.000
No, that's worse
than the stain!

10:46.000 --> 10:48.500
Who's gonna
get blamed for this? Me.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.750
It doesn't matter
who gets blamed for this.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.420
Gosh, Mom's never gonna let
us stay home alone again.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.040
Yo! I got it!

10:55.040 --> 10:56.790
We use this stuff
on the rest of the chair,

10:56.790 --> 10:58.710
and your mom
will never notice the spot,

10:58.710 --> 11:00.670
'cause the whole chair
will be white!

11:01.830 --> 11:05.170
Do you listen to yourself
when you talk?

11:05.170 --> 11:06.790
We have
to cover this up somehow.

11:06.790 --> 11:11.580
We can paint it. I have a watercolor
set with 128 different colors.

11:11.580 --> 11:13.960
I'm sure we can find one
that'll match the chair.

11:13.960 --> 11:15.250
That's perfect!

11:15.250 --> 11:18.330
Yes! I've been waiting for a chance
to break those bad boys out!

11:20.080 --> 11:24.460
-This has to work. -And he's gotta
stop callin' watercolors "bad boys."

11:29.790 --> 11:33.920
(club music playing)

11:33.920 --> 11:36.290
Hey, Chels, you remember this?
Woo-ahh.

11:36.290 --> 11:38.670
-Oh, yeah, I remember that.
-You remember that?

11:38.670 --> 11:40.750
Chels, you remember this?

11:40.750 --> 11:43.080
Oh, you know
I remember that.

11:43.080 --> 11:45.040
(both laughing)

11:45.040 --> 11:46.290
Chels, you remember this?

11:46.290 --> 11:49.750
Ha-huhhh, ha-huhhh,
uh-ahhhh.

11:49.750 --> 11:52.580
No, Rae.
I do not remember that.

11:52.580 --> 11:55.040
You know why? 'Cause I just made it up.
It's called the Baxter Bounce.

11:55.040 --> 11:57.330
Check this out!
Ay-uh-uh, uhh, uhh.

11:57.330 --> 12:01.080
-(grunt) -Ooh! I'm sorry about that,
sorry, I didn't see you there.

12:01.080 --> 12:02.880
I find that hard to believe.

12:07.120 --> 12:11.040
Wow. You real big
for a person.

12:11.040 --> 12:14.080
You real... real big.
Not just big, you strong.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.960
Real strong, aren't you?
You're like, sturdy.

12:15.960 --> 12:18.250
(grunts) I'm a sturdy woman.
(growling)

12:18.250 --> 12:20.920
(laughs) Ooh, I'm gonna
stop talkin' now.

12:22.620 --> 12:24.000
Just watch yourself.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.040
Will do. I'm sorry about that,
I'm just-- I'm-- you know what?

12:26.040 --> 12:27.330
I'm thirsty. I'm gonna
go get some water.

12:27.330 --> 12:28.830
All right?
All right.

12:28.830 --> 12:31.290
Wow, Chels, that woman
is scary. I didn't even see her.

12:31.290 --> 12:33.210
Don't worry about it, Rae.
It's so dark in here,

12:33.210 --> 12:35.000
-you probably thought she was a wall.
-Yeah.

12:39.710 --> 12:41.790
Just a little more blue.

12:44.290 --> 12:46.380
And what do you think?

12:46.380 --> 12:48.080
Levi! Nice work.

12:48.080 --> 12:51.120
That's amazing. You ever
try to paint a $20 bill?

12:51.120 --> 12:52.380
Why would I do that?

12:52.380 --> 12:54.000
No reason.

12:55.880 --> 12:59.500
It's not perfect, but it should
be good enough to fool Mom.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.210
Now it just needs
some time to dry.

13:01.210 --> 13:03.120
No problem. I'll just
stick it in the window,

13:03.120 --> 13:05.620
and it'll be dry
before they get back.

13:05.620 --> 13:06.830
Yo, I can't believe it.

13:06.830 --> 13:08.830
I think we're actually
gonna get away with this.

13:08.830 --> 13:09.960
I know, right? (giggles)

13:09.960 --> 13:11.170
Thanks, guys.

13:11.170 --> 13:12.210
Finally, it's over.

13:12.210 --> 13:14.170
Everything's okay.

13:14.170 --> 13:15.290
(sighs)

13:17.920 --> 13:20.460
No, please don't lock us
in here, no!

13:24.460 --> 13:26.170
I just had a vision.

13:26.170 --> 13:28.540
Mom and Aunt Chels are gonna
get trapped in a giant safe!

13:28.540 --> 13:31.040
That club they went to
tonight used to be a bank.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.830
Maybe they got locked
in the vault!

13:32.830 --> 13:35.120
-How do you know about that club?
-Yo, am I the only one

13:35.120 --> 13:37.000
who watches
What's Lit Chicago?

13:38.750 --> 13:40.620
We gotta get down there
and save them.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.960
-You're right. -But we're not
supposed to leave the house.

13:42.960 --> 13:45.000
Ooh, you're also right.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.170
Look, you got two choices,
stay here and protect your butt,

13:48.170 --> 13:50.170
or sneak out
and protect your mom.

13:50.170 --> 13:53.120
Ooh... this is a tough one.

13:54.830 --> 13:56.540
No, it's not.
Let's go.

13:56.540 --> 13:57.580
Right.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.380
(club music playing)

14:09.380 --> 14:10.960
-Hey, Chels.
-What?

14:10.960 --> 14:12.920
Come on, let's get out there and
show 'em what we're workin' with.

14:14.580 --> 14:16.210
(gasps)

14:16.210 --> 14:19.120
-Oh snap!
-You again!

14:19.120 --> 14:20.920
Oh, my bad, my bad.

14:20.920 --> 14:24.420
Stay cool, Brenda. Remember what your
life coach said, don't do anything crazy

14:24.420 --> 14:27.000
until you count to 10.
One, two--

14:27.000 --> 14:29.170
Wait wait wait wait here, let me
clean it up, let me clean it up.

14:29.170 --> 14:31.750
-Here we go. Oh!
-Ten!

14:31.750 --> 14:36.040
-Ohhhh... -(gasp) W-W-W-Wait,
wait, huh, there's no reason

14:36.040 --> 14:38.330
to get physical. Raven could
make you a new dress.

14:38.330 --> 14:40.580
You know, she actually makes
clothes for dogs for a living,

14:40.580 --> 14:42.670
so it's not a big deal.

14:42.670 --> 14:45.040
Did you just call me
a dog?

14:45.040 --> 14:47.380
Not on purpose.

14:47.380 --> 14:50.170
I'm going to use her
to beat you!

14:50.170 --> 14:51.710
Now, Brenda, Brenda...

14:51.710 --> 14:53.170
what did your life coach say?

14:53.170 --> 14:55.960
Right?
Count to 10.

14:55.960 --> 14:59.460
One... two...

14:59.460 --> 15:00.710
Whaaa!

15:03.460 --> 15:05.420
How are we gonna
get by the doorman?

15:05.420 --> 15:06.960
Let's just tell him the truth.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.750
What? That I had
a psychic vision that our moms

15:08.750 --> 15:10.250
are gonna get stuck
in the vault?

15:10.250 --> 15:12.040
No way he'd believe that.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.670
We gotta sneak in.

15:13.670 --> 15:17.000
Just be smooth.
Act like you belong.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.290
Sup, my man.
How you doin', brother?

15:20.290 --> 15:21.620
I see you, Kim!

15:27.210 --> 15:31.080
Nice try. You kids can't
get into this establishment.

15:31.080 --> 15:33.790
All right, all right,
I feel you, dawg.

15:34.960 --> 15:36.380
But what if we
were chaperoned...

15:36.380 --> 15:38.290
by George Washington?

15:38.290 --> 15:42.790
And his friend...
also George Washington, eh?

15:42.790 --> 15:44.120
You're not gettin' in.

15:44.120 --> 15:45.330
Man.

15:45.330 --> 15:47.290
Hmph. Two dollars.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.000
I don't know, Rae, maybe-- maybe
we should just, uh, go home.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.580
What? No, we're not goin' anywhere, Chels.
This is our night out.

16:00.580 --> 16:03.500
Yeah, you're right. This is our
night, and we're gonna have fun,

16:03.500 --> 16:05.920
even if she uses me
to beat you.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.750
But like, ideally though,
that's not gonna happen.

16:09.250 --> 16:11.170
-Gotcha. We'll just avoid her.
-Yeah.

16:11.170 --> 16:12.960
-Avoid who?
-Both: Aahhhhh!

16:12.960 --> 16:15.880
Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go!

16:15.880 --> 16:17.000
There they are!

16:17.000 --> 16:18.080
(both screaming)

16:21.120 --> 16:23.210
No, please don't lock us
in here, no!

16:23.210 --> 16:25.000
(vault door shuts)

16:26.580 --> 16:28.750
I am not telling my life coach
about this.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.120
No! They're trapped!

16:32.120 --> 16:34.790
Please, sir! Our moms are
locked in that vault!

16:34.790 --> 16:35.960
They need our help!

16:35.960 --> 16:37.290
Look, I know what's
goin' on here.

16:37.290 --> 16:38.960
You got caught tryin'
to sneak in,

16:38.960 --> 16:41.000
so you're makin' up
all these stories.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.330
But it ain't gonna work.

16:43.330 --> 16:45.080
Skedaddle!

16:45.080 --> 16:46.540
(harsher)
Skedaddle!

16:49.250 --> 16:51.420
-Now what?
-I have a plan.

16:51.420 --> 16:55.210
But we're gonna have to squeeze
into a really tight space.

16:57.380 --> 17:01.790
Delivery? (laughs) Oh, I
know what's goin' on here.

17:01.790 --> 17:04.380
These kids
think they're slick.

17:04.380 --> 17:07.120
But you're not
sneakin' into my club!

17:10.290 --> 17:12.210
You weren't kidding.
That back window

17:12.210 --> 17:15.080
was a seriously tight space.

17:15.080 --> 17:18.330
Good call sneaking in through
the kitchen, Wallet Size.

17:18.330 --> 17:21.380
Yeah, these chicken fingers
are ♪ bomb. ♪

17:21.380 --> 17:22.880
Booker!

17:24.540 --> 17:26.380
Focus!

17:26.380 --> 17:28.290
Right. We need to get
over to the vault.

17:28.290 --> 17:30.460
-Okay.
-Everybody, stay low.

17:30.460 --> 17:32.210
It's what I do best.

17:33.380 --> 17:37.170
(club music playing)

17:41.420 --> 17:44.250
Help!
Somebody let us out of here!

17:44.250 --> 17:49.290
Oh my g-- Oh, there's gotta be like a
handle, or a-- a latch, a-- a zipper.

17:50.710 --> 17:52.000
Chels, there's nothing.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.670
Okay, well, we'll just--
we'll call the club,

17:53.670 --> 17:56.080
and we'll tell them we're in
here, and they'll let us out.

17:56.080 --> 17:58.580
-(beeping) -Rae, can I borrow your phone?
I got no signal.

17:58.580 --> 18:00.250
-Ohh...
-Neither do I.

18:00.250 --> 18:01.380
Well, how do they expect people

18:01.380 --> 18:03.290
to make phone calls
from in here?

18:03.290 --> 18:05.380
We're not supposed
to be in here!

18:07.880 --> 18:09.380
How are we gonna
get them out?

18:09.380 --> 18:11.170
Yo, I got it!
We set off the sprinklers,

18:11.170 --> 18:13.710
then they'll have to evacuate
the whole club.

18:13.710 --> 18:15.580
No way.
If my mom's hair gets wet,

18:15.580 --> 18:17.830
it's better for all of us
if she stays in there.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.750
Try turning those!

18:21.750 --> 18:22.830
Okay.

18:25.500 --> 18:26.420
It's stuck.

18:26.420 --> 18:28.120
Pull harder.

18:28.120 --> 18:30.210
It's turning, don't stop.

18:30.210 --> 18:33.460
Hey! Who left chicken
fingers on my floor?

18:35.330 --> 18:37.290
-He's coming!
-Keep him busy.

18:37.290 --> 18:38.670
-I'll get the open.
-Okay.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.460
You're comin' with me.

18:42.460 --> 18:43.290
Run!

18:45.330 --> 18:47.460
Ha-ha, where you goin'?

18:47.460 --> 18:48.920
(laughs)

18:48.920 --> 18:49.960
Oh!

18:49.960 --> 18:51.170
Ooh. Okay.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.790
Come on, muscles. This is
what we've been training for.

18:58.830 --> 19:01.330
Don't worry.
Someone's gonna find us soon.

19:02.920 --> 19:06.420
What if they don't, Chels?
What if they don't find us?

19:06.420 --> 19:09.170
What if we're stuck in here,
and we run outta air?

19:09.170 --> 19:13.710
(laughs)
You can't run outta air.

19:15.330 --> 19:18.290
-Can you run out of air?
-Yeah.

19:18.290 --> 19:19.540
Air is how I breathe!

19:19.540 --> 19:22.120
(inhaling deeply) Oh no, I
think I'm running out of air!

19:22.120 --> 19:25.420
Rae! If this is the end, there's
something I gotta tell you, okay?

19:25.420 --> 19:29.500
-What? -I can't believe I'm
gonna say this... but--

19:29.500 --> 19:32.500
-(creaking)
-Almost there.

19:32.500 --> 19:35.120
Chels! I can't believe
you kept that from me!

19:35.120 --> 19:38.290
We were in international waters!
I didn't think it would count!

19:38.290 --> 19:40.540
It always counts, Chels!

19:42.330 --> 19:45.420
(both screaming)

19:45.420 --> 19:48.460
-We're saved! -Yeah, but we're not
finished with that conversation!

19:48.460 --> 19:50.170
I know.

19:53.880 --> 19:56.380
-You did it!
-We gotta get outta here.

19:56.380 --> 19:57.960
We don't want Mom and Aunt Chels
to see us.

19:57.960 --> 20:00.460
Yeah. And 'cause I just saw
my English teacher dancing

20:00.460 --> 20:01.580
with my physics teacher.

20:01.580 --> 20:03.830
-Why is that bad? -She's
married to my Spanish teacher!

20:04.880 --> 20:06.170
Go, go, go!

20:07.380 --> 20:10.580
Oh, I really didn't want
to fight tonight.

20:10.580 --> 20:14.210
Ah, who am I kidding? That's
the only reason I came.

20:14.210 --> 20:17.080
Okay, listen here,
Little Miss Giant Lady,

20:17.080 --> 20:18.250
I just wanted to have
a good time.

20:18.250 --> 20:19.750
I wasn't trying
to ruin your night.

20:19.750 --> 20:22.460
-Well, it's too late for that.
-All right, I've had enough.

20:22.460 --> 20:25.580
You cannot treat people
like this.

20:25.580 --> 20:28.620
We haven't been out without
our children in years,

20:28.620 --> 20:30.120
and this was our chance.

20:30.120 --> 20:34.580
You know? Our one chance to go
out and have fun, you know,

20:34.580 --> 20:37.880
be adults, and you ruined it.
Instead, we spent the entire night

20:37.880 --> 20:40.290
running from you.

20:40.290 --> 20:41.920
Well, I've gotta tell
you, lady, you know?

20:41.920 --> 20:45.830
I've-- I've had it! Okay? So,
you'd best back up on offa me!

20:47.830 --> 20:50.420
Yo, I'd listen to her,
her baby daddy's in jail.

20:51.920 --> 20:55.710
Are we gonna have a problem
in my club tonight?

20:55.710 --> 20:58.540
I don't know.
Are we?

21:00.580 --> 21:02.710
No, we're good.

21:02.710 --> 21:04.580
That's what I thought, Brenda.
That's what I thought.

21:04.580 --> 21:07.170
-You'd better walk away!
-Yeah.

21:07.170 --> 21:10.000
I knew I shouldn't
have let you in here.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.250
(sighs)

21:11.250 --> 21:13.250
Chels, that was amazing. I
didn't know you had it in you.

21:13.250 --> 21:16.790
I know, me neither! I just couldn't stand
to watch that lady ruin our night.

21:16.790 --> 21:20.620
Yeah, we did have a crazy night. I lost
my ID, you know, we danced all night,

21:20.620 --> 21:22.540
we got in a fight with Brenda,
we got locked in the vault!

21:22.540 --> 21:25.750
-(laughs)
-Our club game is weak.

21:25.750 --> 21:27.750
But it doesn't matter, Rae.
We went out.

21:27.750 --> 21:29.000
Yeah, we did.
Yeah, we did.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.920
Rae and Chels went out.

21:30.920 --> 21:33.670
Both: ♪ Rae and Chels went out!
Rae and Chels went out! ♪

21:33.670 --> 21:36.000
♪ Rae and Chels went out! ♪

21:36.000 --> 21:38.880
Rae and Chels
need to go home!

21:38.880 --> 21:42.880
All right. I'm telling you,
we're just good friends.

21:47.750 --> 21:49.500
Mom and Aunt Chelsea
are gonna be home any second.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.170
We have to clean this place up.

21:58.750 --> 22:01.500
Booker, don't just
stand there. Help!

22:01.500 --> 22:04.420
It's gone, Nia.
It's gone!

22:06.170 --> 22:07.580
What do you mean,
"it's gone"?

22:07.580 --> 22:10.250
The cushion must've
fallen out the window.

22:10.250 --> 22:11.750
Let's just go down and get it!

22:11.750 --> 22:12.750
Okay.

22:20.040 --> 22:23.790
Now why would my cushion
be on the sidewalk?

22:25.250 --> 22:26.330
Uhhh...

22:26.330 --> 22:29.000
Booker? Explain.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.120
Okay. I spilled on the chair,
and we tried to fix it,

22:33.120 --> 22:36.830
but, when we put the cushion in the
window to dry, it must've fallen out.

22:36.830 --> 22:39.460
I told you to leave this house
exactly like I left it.

22:39.460 --> 22:42.710
I know, and I apologize.

22:42.710 --> 22:46.790
I guess you were right. I'm not
responsible enough to be left home alone.

22:48.580 --> 22:49.920
Actually, you are.

22:49.920 --> 22:50.920
Kids:
He is?

22:52.620 --> 22:54.120
Yes, he is.

22:54.120 --> 22:56.920
'Cause you coulda lied,
and you didn't.

22:56.920 --> 22:59.540
Which means I can trust you.

22:59.540 --> 23:01.830
Yeah.
You guys really proved

23:01.830 --> 23:03.540
you can handle
stayin' at home on your own.

23:03.540 --> 23:06.210
Yeah. That means
that we can go out

23:06.210 --> 23:07.710
clubbin' anytime we want to!

23:07.710 --> 23:09.460
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

23:09.460 --> 23:10.620
(Chelsea and Raven laugh)

23:10.620 --> 23:11.670
But we're not gonna, are we?

23:11.670 --> 23:13.540
Oh, no, I gotta untape,
unsqueeze, unpush

23:13.540 --> 23:15.500
everything I got, girl, no.

23:18.960 --> 23:21.460
So, we all good. (laughs)

23:21.460 --> 23:24.000
Ooh! As long as they never
find out what happened

23:24.000 --> 23:25.580
at the club.

23:25.580 --> 23:28.420
-Raven: Booker!
-She knows!
