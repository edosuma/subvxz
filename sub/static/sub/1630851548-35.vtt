THEY COULD DO BUILD MISSILES NOT

08:35.882 --> 08:37.450
PARTICULARLY WELL, WHEREAS THE

08:37.516 --> 08:39.218
CHINESE ARE DOING AI, THEY ARE

08:39.285 --> 08:40.820
DOING QUANTUM COMPUTING,

08:51.564 --> 08:52.565
TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.

08:52.632 --> 08:54.400
AT THE END OF THE DAY, I'M AN

I THINK THE OPENNESS, THE

08:58.104 --> 09:00.439

09:00.506 --> 09:01.874
WORRIED ABOUT JAPAN IN THE

09:03.576 --> 09:04.877
TO REMEMBER THAT AND EVERYONE

09:04.944 --> 09:05.678

CONSPIRACY THEORISTS, AND THE

17:17.369 --> 17:18.871
DANGEROUS POLICIES OF JOE

17:36.221 --> 17:38.757
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

17:38.824 --> 17:40.759
BEFORE I GET TO THE ISSUES,

17:40.826 --> 17:42.928
ERIC, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING FOR

17:42.995 --> 17:45.330
ME?

17:45.397 --> 17:46.732
>> [LAUGHTER]

17:46.799 --> 17:47.433
, NO WRAPPING PAPER.

17:47.499 --> 17:51.970
>> Bill: I SAW YOU GIVE POT TO

17:52.037 --> 17:52.905
STEPHEN COLBERT, WHAT ARE YOU

17:52.971 --> 17:54.606
GIVING IT TO HIM FOR?

17:54.673 --> 17:55.641
HE'S A SQUARE, I'M SOMEONE WHO

17:55.707 --> 18:01.413
WILL USE IT.

18:01.480 --> 18:02.381
SOMETHING BAD I THINK HAPPENED

18:02.448 --> 18:04.583
IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY, I THINK

18:04.650 --> 18:05.217
VIGILANTES GOT A SINGLE YOU CAN

18:05.284 --> 18:06.618
GO OUT AND DO WHATEVER YOU WANT

18:06.685 --> 18:07.453
WHICH I DON'T THINK IS GOING TO

18:07.519 --> 18:09.421
BE GOOD BUT FOR A TALK SHOW HOST

18:09.488 --> 18:11.023
WAS ABOUT TO GO ON VACATION ON A

18:11.089 --> 18:14.593
DEBATE SHOW, THIS IS A DREAM.

18:14.660 --> 18:15.727
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS READ BOTH OF

18:15.794 --> 18:16.662
YOUR STATEMENTS TODAY AND WE ARE

18:16.728 --> 18:20.065
OFF TO THE RACES.

18:20.132 --> 18:23.402
MISSES YOU -- THIS DECISION IS

18:23.469 --> 18:24.937
AN INDICTMENT OF IRRESPONSIBLE

18:25.003 --> 18:26.538
LAWS THAT MAKE OUR SOCIETY FAR

18:26.605 --> 18:27.806
MORE VIOLENT AND UNSAFE UNDER

18:27.873 --> 18:29.508
THE GUISE OF PERSONAL FREEDOM

18:29.575 --> 18:30.309
AND SO-CALLED SELF-DEFENSE.

18:30.375 --> 18:35.147
[APPLAUSE]

18:35.214 --> 18:35.781
CHRIS CHRISTIE SAYS JUSTICE WAS

18:35.848 --> 18:38.917
DONE IN THE RITTENHOUSE VERDICT.

18:38.984 --> 18:41.553
IT RENEWS OUR FAITH IN THE JURY

18:41.620 --> 18:44.189
SYSTEM.

18:44.256 --> 18:45.390
[BOOS]

18:45.457 --> 18:46.859
>> I THINK THE REAL CRISIS HERE

18:46.925 --> 18:50.496
THAT WE ARE MISSING IN

18:50.562 --> 18:52.331
BROWNSVILLE, A 17-YEAR-OLD CAN

18:52.397 --> 18:56.034
GET AN ASSAULT RIFLE, FASTER

18:56.101 --> 18:58.570
THAN HE COULD GET A COMPUTER.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.205
THIS 17 YEAR OLD, IT WAS ILLEGAL

19:00.272 --> 19:01.974
FOR HIM TO PURCHASE THE RIFLE,

19:02.040 --> 19:03.575
BUT IT WAS LEGAL FOR HIM TO

19:03.642 --> 19:07.246
CARRY IT ACROSS STATE LINES,

19:07.312 --> 19:09.314
GOING INTO A COMMUNITY, LOOKING

19:09.381 --> 19:10.782
FOR PEOPLE THAT HE WANTED TO

19:10.849 --> 19:14.753
SHOOT OR IN SOME WAY DISRUPT.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.321
THAT IS A CRISIS.

19:16.388 --> 19:18.590
WHAT ARE WE DOING TO OUR

19:18.657 --> 19:22.995
CHILDREN?

19:23.061 --> 19:23.762
THAT YOU HAVE ACCESS --

19:23.829 --> 19:25.330
>> Bill: LEGAL FOR HIM TO

19:25.397 --> 19:26.565
CARRY IT?

19:26.632 --> 19:28.033
THAT'S AS CRAZY AS WHERE YOUR

19:28.100 --> 19:28.800
MASK WHEN YOU WALK INTO THE

19:28.867 --> 19:31.003
RESTAURANT AND TAKE IT OFF WHEN

19:31.069 --> 19:31.637
YOU EAT.

19:31.703 --> 19:32.404
IT'S CRAZY.

19:32.471 --> 19:33.405
>> IT REALLY IS.

19:33.472 --> 19:36.041
>> I DON'T THINK OUR TWO

19:36.108 --> 19:37.576
STATEMENTS ARE NECESSARILY AS

19:37.643 --> 19:39.845
DIFFERENT AS YOU THINK.

19:39.912 --> 19:40.445
>> Bill: WHAT?

19:40.512 --> 19:43.615
>> WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS

19:43.682 --> 19:46.385
I LOOK ADDED AS A PROSECUTOR.

19:46.451 --> 19:47.986
THE LAWS ARE WHAT THEY ARE, YOU

19:48.053 --> 19:50.355
DON'T GET TO CHANGE THE LAWS AND

19:50.422 --> 19:51.523
IN THE END, THE EVIDENCE THEY

19:51.590 --> 19:53.825
HAD DID NOT PROVE WHAT THEY

19:53.892 --> 19:55.928
NEEDED TO PROVE BEYOND A

19:55.994 --> 19:57.162
REASONABLE DOUBT.

19:57.229 --> 19:58.564
IF YOU HAVE AN OBJECTION TO THE

19:58.630 --> 19:59.898
LAWS AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT

19:59.965 --> 20:01.033
ERIC WAS TALKING ABOUT, THEN

20:01.099 --> 20:03.035
CHANGE THE LAWS.

20:03.101 --> 20:05.137
BUT DON'T BRING A CASE YOU CAN'T

20:05.203 --> 20:07.639
PROVE IT BEYOND A REASONABLE

20:07.706 --> 20:08.607
DOUBT THEIR GUILT >> Bill:

20:08.674 --> 20:09.841
YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT FROM A

20:09.908 --> 20:10.075
VERY --

20:10.142 --> 20:12.778
>> THAT'S WHAT MY STATEMENT WAS.

20:12.844 --> 20:15.113
>> Bill: LET'S PULL BACK TO

20:15.180 --> 20:15.814
30,000 FEET NOW.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.083
WHAT ABOUT THE REPERCUSSIONS OF

20:18.150 --> 20:18.884
THIS?

20:18.951 --> 20:19.418
WHAT ABOUT THE MESSAGE THIS

20:19.484 --> 20:21.954
SENDS TO ALL THE KIDS -- I THINK

20:22.020 --> 20:23.589
THIS KID WATCHED TOO MANY

20:23.655 --> 20:24.022
COMIC BOOK MOVIE IS.

20:24.089 --> 20:25.457
I THINK HE WANTS TO BE SOME SORT

20:25.524 --> 20:26.658
OF HERO AND I THINK THERE'S LOTS

20:26.725 --> 20:28.460
OF IN SALES OUT THERE LIKE HIM

20:28.527 --> 20:32.764
WHO WILL DO THE SAME THING, IT'S

20:32.831 --> 20:33.365
A TINDERBOX.

20:33.432 --> 20:35.867
I READ TODAY, 46% OF PEOPLE IN

20:35.934 --> 20:37.569
THIS COUNTRY ACCORDING TO THE

20:37.636 --> 20:41.640
ZOGBY POLL THINKS A CIVIL WAR IS

20:41.707 --> 20:41.974
LIKELY.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.208
HALF THE COUNTRY THINKS A

20:43.275 --> 20:44.042
CIVIL WAR IS LIKELY COME I DON'T

20:44.109 --> 20:46.345
THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA TO SAY

20:46.411 --> 20:48.447
TO PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:48.513 --> 20:49.982
IF THE POLICE ARE NOT DOING THE

20:50.048 --> 20:52.250
JOB AS THEY WEREN'T AT THAT

20:52.317 --> 20:54.119
MOMENT IN KENOSHA, THE ANSWER

20:54.186 --> 20:56.388
CAN'T BE THAN THE CITIZENS HAVE

20:56.455 --> 20:56.955
FULL POLICE POWERS.

20:57.022 --> 20:59.891
THAT CAN'T BE THE RESPONSE,

20:59.958 --> 21:02.728
RIGHT?

21:02.794 --> 21:05.797
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

21:05.864 --> 21:09.801
>> I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT,

21:09.868 --> 21:12.671
THE POINT IS YOU CAN'T USE AN

21:12.738 --> 21:13.872
INDIVIDUAL CASE TO SEND A

21:13.939 --> 21:15.707
BROADER SOCIETAL MESSAGE IF THE

21:15.774 --> 21:18.543
LAWS DON'T COVER IT.

21:18.610 --> 21:19.778
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO THEN IF WE

21:19.845 --> 21:20.812
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND WE

21:20.879 --> 21:22.848
SHOULD BE IS WE NEED TO GO AFTER

21:22.914 --> 21:24.383
THE LAWS AND MAKE SURE IT'S VERY

21:24.449 --> 21:26.084
CLEAR TO PEOPLE THAT YOU CAN'T

21:26.151 --> 21:28.253
TAKE THE LAW INTO YOUR OWN

21:28.320 --> 21:28.453
HANDS.

21:28.520 --> 21:28.720
[APPLAUSE]

21:28.787 --> 21:31.390
THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO, NOT

21:31.456 --> 21:33.158
CONVICT SOMEBODY WHO UNDER THE

21:33.225 --> 21:35.527
LAW WAS NOT ENTITLED TO BE

21:35.594 --> 21:35.961
CONVICTED.

21:36.028 --> 21:37.329
>> WHAT I BELIEVE WE MUST TAKE

21:37.396 --> 21:40.465
INTO OUR OWN HANDS, MY PLEA TO

21:40.532 --> 21:44.102
AMERICA WE MUST TAKE OUR COUNTRY

21:44.169 --> 21:44.302
BACK.

21:44.369 --> 21:46.538
WE ARE ALLOWING THE FRINGE

21:46.605 --> 21:48.707
ELEMENTS IN BOTH OF THESE

21:48.774 --> 21:50.175
CONVERSATIONS TO HIJACK WHAT

21:50.242 --> 21:52.377
EVERYDAY AMERICANS WANT.

21:52.444 --> 21:54.946
WE WANT TO SAY FOR CITIES,

21:55.013 --> 21:56.782
EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN AND TO BE

21:56.848 --> 21:57.215
GAINFULLY EMPLOYED.

21:57.282 --> 22:01.953
[APPLAUSE]

22:02.020 --> 22:02.621
WHEN YOU HAVE THIS DIVISION THAT

22:02.688 --> 22:05.457
IS RIPPING US APART -- I'M

22:05.524 --> 22:07.759
REALLY CONCERNED.

22:07.826 --> 22:11.496
I BELIEVE THERE IS AN AMICUS

22:11.563 --> 22:14.366
GROUP IN THIS COUNTRY, THE ONLY

22:14.433 --> 22:17.102
DESIRE IS TO CONTINUE TO PULL

22:17.169 --> 22:18.537
OUR CITIES APART.

22:18.603 --> 22:20.405
I SAW POLICE VEHICLES BEING

22:20.472 --> 22:21.807
FIREBOMBED, I SAW THE

22:21.873 --> 22:22.741
INSTRUCTION OF PROPERTY, WE HAVE

22:22.808 --> 22:23.575
A PLACE IN PORTLAND WHERE THERE

22:23.642 --> 22:26.445
IS A CITY IN A CITY, THIS IS

22:26.511 --> 22:27.813
AMERICA, THERE'S ONLY ONE

22:27.879 --> 22:29.681
COUNTRY CALLED AMERICA, IF NOT

22:29.748 --> 22:30.415
MULTIPLE COUNTRIES.

22:30.482 --> 22:31.183
>> Bill: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

22:31.249 --> 22:33.318
A GROUP ON THE LEFT OR ON THE

22:33.385 --> 22:33.685
RIGHT OR BOTH?

22:33.752 --> 22:36.254
>> BOTH.

22:36.321 --> 22:39.858
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG -- BEING

22:39.925 --> 22:41.026
PRAGMATIC IS PROGRESSIVE.

22:41.093 --> 22:44.896
I'M PROGRESSIVE, I WANT TO DEAL

22:44.963 --> 22:46.765
WITH OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

22:46.832 --> 22:48.533
THAT'S UNFAIR COME I WANT TO

22:48.600 --> 22:49.167
CLOSE RIKERS ISLAND BUT I WANT

22:49.234 --> 22:55.140
TO CLOSE THE PIPELINE THAT FEEDS

22:55.207 --> 22:55.474
RIKERS ISLAND.

22:55.540 --> 23:00.078
30% OF THOSE CHILDREN --

23:00.145 --> 23:00.812
[APPLAUSE]

23:00.879 --> 23:03.348
>> I THINK YOU JUST HEARD WHY HE

23:03.415 --> 23:03.515
WON.

23:03.582 --> 23:04.750
DESPITE THE DIVISIONS WE ARE

23:04.816 --> 23:05.650
TALKING ABOUT IN THE COUNTRY

23:05.717 --> 23:06.785
WHICH ARE VERY REAL, THERE IS

23:06.852 --> 23:09.121
STILL A LARGE SECTION OF THE

23:09.187 --> 23:09.955
COUNTRY THAT SAYS JUST TALK

23:10.021 --> 23:12.758
COMMON SENSE TO ME.

23:12.824 --> 23:15.627
FOR INSTANCE, HE'S TALKING ABOUT

23:15.694 --> 23:17.596
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH RIKERS

23:17.662 --> 23:19.397
ISLAND, WHEN I WAS GOVERNOR WE

23:19.464 --> 23:20.832
CLOSED CIRCLE PRISONS BECAUSE WE

23:20.899 --> 23:22.100
AREN'T KEEPING NONVIOLENT PEOPLE

23:22.167 --> 23:23.568
IN JAIL BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

23:23.635 --> 23:24.836
AFFORD $500 IN BAIL.

23:24.903 --> 23:26.171
THE REALLY VIOLENT PEOPLE STAY

23:26.238 --> 23:26.838
IN JAIL.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.240
OF THE NONVIOLENT ONES WE PUT A

23:28.306 --> 23:29.574
BRACELET AROUND THEM, WE MAKE

23:29.641 --> 23:30.809
SURE THEY SHOW UP FOR COURT AND

23:30.876 --> 23:33.011
THEY DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO,

23:33.078 --> 23:34.780
BUT WE ARE NOT FEELING JAILS

23:34.846 --> 23:37.415
WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY IN

23:37.482 --> 23:38.950
DEBTOR'S PRISON.

23:39.017 --> 23:40.085
CRIME WENT DOWN IN NEW JERSEY

23:40.152 --> 23:42.454
WHEN WE DID THAT.

23:42.521 --> 23:43.488
[APPLAUSE]

23:43.555 --> 23:45.323
>> Bill: AS TWO POLITICIANS

23:45.390 --> 23:46.057
WHO ARE TOWARD THE CENTER OF

23:46.124 --> 23:48.326
YOUR PARTIES, RIGHT?

23:48.393 --> 23:54.766
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE WITH THAT?

23:54.833 --> 23:55.867
>> I DON'T LIKE THE TITLES THAT

23:55.934 --> 23:59.171
PEOPLE TRY TO DEFINE ME, I'M

23:59.237 --> 24:04.609
TRYING TO DEFINE MYSELF.

24:04.676 --> 24:05.510
[APPLAUSE]

24:05.577 --> 24:08.346
>> Bill: THAT'S PRETTY VAGUE.

24:08.413 --> 24:09.481
COMPARED TO SAY, BERNIE SANDERS,

24:09.548 --> 24:10.749
I WOULD SAY YOU'RE MORE TOWARD

24:10.816 --> 24:13.585
THE CENTER, BY THE WAY, THIS IS

24:13.652 --> 24:15.020
WHY WE LIKE YOU.

24:15.086 --> 24:17.322
STOP APOLOGIZING, I THINK IT'S

24:17.389 --> 24:17.589
FANTASTIC.

24:17.656 --> 24:20.592
>> I THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE -- I

24:20.659 --> 24:21.793
BELIEVE IT'S UNFAIR TO AMERICANS

24:21.860 --> 24:23.562
BECAUSE YOU HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS

24:23.628 --> 24:24.896
ON DIFFERENT THINGS, WE WANT TO

24:24.963 --> 24:26.832
SAY HERE IS THE LITMUS TEST.

24:26.898 --> 24:31.803
WE HAVE TO BREAK FREE OF THAT.

24:31.870 --> 24:33.772
>> Bill: I WOULD SAY I'M MORE

24:33.839 --> 24:34.539
TOWARD THE CENTER.

24:34.606 --> 24:36.341
I THINK I'M LEFT BUT MORE TOWARD

24:36.408 --> 24:37.375
THE CENTER OF.

24:37.442 --> 24:38.176
I'M ALWAYS FIGHTING WITH THE FAR

24:38.243 --> 24:41.446
LEFT AND THE FAR RIGHT.

24:41.513 --> 24:44.082
TO SOMEONE LIKE ME IT LOOKS LIKE

24:44.149 --> 24:46.384
ONE SIDE WANTS TO DEMORALIZE THE

24:46.451 --> 24:47.919
POLICE TO THE POINT WHERE THEY

24:47.986 --> 24:49.421
SOMETIMES DON'T SHOW UP AND THAT

24:49.487 --> 24:51.189
DOES HAPPEN AND MAYBE THAT

24:51.256 --> 24:53.391
HAPPENED IN KENOSHA, RIGHT?

24:53.458 --> 24:55.994
THE OTHER SIDE WANTS TO MAKE THE

24:56.061 --> 24:57.596
CITIZENS OF SOME SORT VIGILANTE

24:57.662 --> 24:58.430
FORCE.

24:58.496 --> 24:58.997
WHY CAN'T WE HAVE SOMETHING

24:59.064 --> 25:01.933
THAT'S SENSIBLE IN THE MIDDLE?

25:02.000 --> 25:08.807
THIS IS WHY YOU AS AN EX-COP --

25:08.874 --> 25:12.143
>> I WOULD TELL YOU WHEN I WAS

25:12.210 --> 25:13.345
GOVERNOR WE HAD CAMDEN WHICH WAS

25:13.411 --> 25:14.546
THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN

25:14.613 --> 25:16.181
AMERICA AT THE TIME.

25:16.248 --> 25:17.849
WE FIRED THE ENTIRE POLICE

25:17.916 --> 25:19.150
FORCE, WE BROUGHT THEM BACK IN

25:19.217 --> 25:20.819
AND WE TRAINED THEM BASED UPON

25:20.886 --> 25:23.521
COMMUNITY POLICING AND IN

25:23.588 --> 25:25.724
VIOLENCE THE ESCALATION AND

25:25.790 --> 25:28.093
INVOLVEMENT IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS

25:28.159 --> 25:30.729
OUT OF CARS COME ON BICYCLES, ON

25:30.795 --> 25:33.832
FOOT AND MURDERS WENT DOWN 75%

25:33.899 --> 25:34.499
IN CAMDEN BECAUSE THE CITIZENS

25:34.566 --> 25:35.934
DIDN'T SEE THE POLICE AS THE

25:36.001 --> 25:37.202
ENEMIES ANYMORE, THEY SAW THEM

25:37.269 --> 25:38.637
AS PARTNERS AND THE POLICE

25:38.703 --> 25:40.605
DIDN'T SEE THE CITIZENS AS

25:40.672 --> 25:41.573
ENEMIES ANYMORE, THEY SAW THEM

25:41.640 --> 25:43.775
AS PEOPLE WORTHY TO PROTECT.

25:43.842 --> 25:44.676
THAT'S WHERE WE GOT TO GET WITH

25:44.743 --> 25:49.281
POLICING IN THIS COUNTRY.

25:49.347 --> 25:51.983
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

25:52.050 --> 25:55.387
>> WHAT THE GOVERNOR SAID IS SO

25:55.453 --> 25:57.889
CORRECT, HOW DO WE DEFINE THE

25:57.956 --> 25:58.857
EQUAL SYSTEM OF PUBLIC SAFETY?

25:58.924 --> 26:03.161
WE HAVE NOT DONE THAT.

26:03.228 --> 26:03.728
TRADITIONALLY, POLICING HAS

26:03.795 --> 26:05.430
ALWAYS BEEN -- PUBLIC SAFETY HAS

26:05.497 --> 26:09.768
ALWAYS BEEN JUST THE POLICE.

26:09.834 --> 26:11.303
WE CALL THEM FOR EVERYTHING BUT

26:11.369 --> 26:13.371
IF WE REDEFINE THE ECOSYSTEM,

26:13.438 --> 26:15.140
COMMUNITY GROUPS, CRISIS

26:15.206 --> 26:16.841
MANAGEMENT, YOUTH ORGANIZATION,

26:16.908 --> 26:18.076
WE BUILT THAT TRUST BECAUSE THE

26:18.143 --> 26:20.812
BAD GUYS ARE LOOKING AT US AND

26:20.879 --> 26:21.079
LAUGHING.

26:21.146 --> 26:23.682
>> Bill: AND TAKE SOME OF THE

26:23.748 --> 26:24.816
BURDEN OFF POLICE.

26:24.883 --> 26:25.884
WHO ARE DOING THINGS -- I WATCH

26:25.951 --> 26:27.786
COPS WHO ARE ALWAYS ON THE FRONT

26:27.852 --> 26:30.555
PORCH OF SOMEBODY'S HOUSE ABOUT

26:30.622 --> 26:32.857
THEIR MARRIAGE.

26:32.924 --> 26:34.025
>> PROFESSIONALS RESPONDED TO

26:34.092 --> 26:36.528
THOSE NONVIOLENT JOBS, YOU CAN

26:36.594 --> 26:37.228
HAVE A DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP

26:37.295 --> 26:39.264
AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE GOING

26:39.331 --> 26:39.464
TO --

26:39.531 --> 26:42.334
>> Bill: YOU SAID IT, WE

26:42.400 --> 26:42.867
DEFINE.

26:42.934 --> 26:43.535
THE DEMOCRATS ALWAYS FALL INTO

26:43.601 --> 26:47.939
THE TRAP OF GETTING WORD FUCKED.

26:48.006 --> 26:52.777
>> I LOVE THIS SHOW.

26:52.844 --> 26:53.445
[LAUGHTER]

26:53.511 --> 26:55.046
I COULDN'T GET AWAY WITH SAYING

26:55.113 --> 26:57.148
THAT.

26:57.215 --> 27:00.518
>> Bill: OH, YES, YOU COULD.

27:00.585 --> 27:02.721
>> I COULDN'T.

27:02.787 --> 27:03.822
>> Bill: WRIGHT, CHRIS, YOU'VE

27:03.888 --> 27:08.093
NEVER SAID "BUCK!"

27:08.159 --> 27:08.326
NOT YOU.

27:08.393 --> 27:10.495
>> NOT LIKE THAT.

27:10.562 --> 27:12.831
>> Bill: INSTEAD OF CALLING

27:12.897 --> 27:15.200
THE FUND, REDEFINE.

27:15.266 --> 27:16.234
>> WORDS ARE POWERFUL.

27:16.301 --> 27:16.634
>> Bill: EXACTLY!

27:16.701 --> 27:18.737
>> I AGREE THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD

27:18.803 --> 27:19.838
BE DOING.

27:19.904 --> 27:21.172
>> Bill: HERE'S WHAT JILL

27:21.239 --> 27:22.574
BIDEN SAID AFTER KENOSHA IN

27:22.640 --> 27:24.542
2020, HE SAID I WANT TO BE VERY

27:24.609 --> 27:25.977
CLEAR ABOUT ALL OF THIS, RIOTING

27:26.044 --> 27:27.245
IS NOT PROTESTING, LOOTING IS

27:27.312 --> 27:29.314
NOT PROTESTING, SETTING FIRES IS

27:29.381 --> 27:30.782
NOT PROTESTING, IT'S

27:30.849 --> 27:31.549
LAWLESSNESS, PLAIN AND SIMPLE

27:31.616 --> 27:33.318
AND THOSE WHO DO IT SHOULD BE

27:33.385 --> 27:34.819
PROSECUTED -- SOUNDS LIKE YOU.

27:34.886 --> 27:36.588
I FEEL LIKE THAT'S WHAT HE GOT

27:36.654 --> 27:37.422
ELECTED TO.

27:37.489 --> 27:38.523
THE PERCEPTION NOW AMONG MANY

27:38.590 --> 27:39.991
PEOPLE AS THAT'S NOT THE GUY WHO

27:40.058 --> 27:43.895
WAS IN OFFICE, THAT HE HAS SWUNG

27:43.962 --> 27:44.129
LEFT.

27:44.195 --> 27:45.964
>> IT'S THE NARRATIVE.

27:46.031 --> 27:47.599
>> Bill: IS THAT TRUE?

27:47.665 --> 27:48.166
>> NO.

27:48.233 --> 27:49.734
I BELIEVE WE NEED TO RE-CLEAN

27:49.801 --> 27:50.702
THE NARRATIVE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT

27:50.769 --> 27:53.004
THE BUILD BACK BETTER BILL, THE

27:53.071 --> 27:55.106
STUFF IN THE BILL ABOUT

27:55.173 --> 27:57.442
UNIVERSAL CHILD CARE, WHEN YOU

27:57.509 --> 27:58.443
LOOK AT GOOD THINGS THAT ARE

27:58.510 --> 28:03.548
BEING DONE, WE ARE NOT TALKING

28:03.615 --> 28:05.316
TO AMERICANS WITH THOSE KITCHEN

28:05.383 --> 28:06.518
TABLE ISSUES.

28:06.584 --> 28:09.754
WE ARE GETTING SO COMPLICATED.

28:09.821 --> 28:11.723
WHAT'S ZERO IN ON WHAT

28:11.790 --> 28:12.924
AMERICANS, WHAT NEW YORKERS,

28:12.991 --> 28:13.591
WHAT WE WANT.

28:13.658 --> 28:15.360
THAT'S WHAT I DID ON THE

28:15.427 --> 28:16.895
CAMPAIGN TRAIL, I TALKED

28:16.961 --> 28:17.962
DIRECTLY ABOUT WHAT NEW YORKERS

28:18.029 --> 28:19.497
WANTED AND THAT'S WHAT DEMOCRATS

28:19.564 --> 28:20.398
MUST DO.

28:20.465 --> 28:21.266
>> Bill: THIS THING IS ALL

28:21.332 --> 28:23.935
ABOUT GUNS.

28:24.002 --> 28:26.137
WHERE ARE YOU ON THE GUNS?

28:26.204 --> 28:27.939
YOU CARRY A GUN, YOU'RE PROBABLY

28:28.006 --> 28:28.339
STRAPPED NOW.

28:28.406 --> 28:30.642
BUT I WANT YOU TO HAVE A GUN,

28:30.708 --> 28:32.243
YOU'RE AN EX-COP, I TRUST YOU

28:32.310 --> 28:36.581
WITH A GUN, I DON'T TRUST KYLE.

28:36.648 --> 28:38.349
IS A KID.

28:38.416 --> 28:40.085
I KNOW THIS IS COMING UP BEFORE

28:40.151 --> 28:41.386
THE SUPREME COURT, OPEN CARRY

28:41.453 --> 28:42.787
INCLUDES A NEW YORK CASE, WHERE

28:42.854 --> 28:45.123
DO YOU STAND?

28:45.190 --> 28:47.258
>> I HAVEN'T CARRIED IN 15

28:47.325 --> 28:47.459
YEARS.

28:47.525 --> 28:50.328
I CAN'T CARRY IN CALIFORNIA.

28:50.395 --> 28:52.797
>> Bill: YOU WOULD LIKE TO?

28:52.864 --> 28:56.935
>> THE SUPREME COURT IS ABOUT TO

28:57.001 --> 28:57.535
MAKE AN IMPORTANT DECISION

28:57.602 --> 29:00.138
THAT'S ABOUT TO IMPACT US AND

29:00.205 --> 29:01.239
I'M HOPING THEY DON'T ALLOW THE

29:01.306 --> 29:04.742
CONCEALED CARRY TWO WE DO A

29:04.809 --> 29:06.377
GREAT JOB WITH OUR LAWS IN

29:06.444 --> 29:07.479
NEW YORK AND I'M HOPING THEY

29:07.545 --> 29:09.013
CONSIDER NOT TO MAKE THIS

29:09.080 --> 29:09.347
DECISION.

29:09.414 --> 29:10.381
>> Bill: OKAY, GOOD TO.

29:10.448 --> 29:12.417
WE DON'T WANT TO BE THE OLD

29:12.484 --> 29:12.617
WEST.

29:12.684 --> 29:15.386
>> I GO BACK TO THE STUFF YOU

29:15.453 --> 29:16.788
SAID -- WHAT PRESIDENT BIDEN

29:16.855 --> 29:18.289
SAID IN 20 VERSES WHERE HE IS

29:18.356 --> 29:19.290
NOW, THAT IS THE BIGGEST REASON

29:19.357 --> 29:22.894
WHY HIS POLL NUMBERS HAVE GONE

29:22.961 --> 29:24.195
DOWN SO MUCH.

29:24.262 --> 29:25.763
HE CAMPAIGNED THAT WAY, HE

29:25.830 --> 29:27.298
CAMPAIGNED AS A UNITER, A

29:27.365 --> 29:28.299
CENTRIST, GOING TO BRING THE

29:28.366 --> 29:29.501
COUNTRY TOGETHER AND RETURN

29:29.567 --> 29:32.937
THINGS TO NORMALCY, THAT WAS HIS

29:33.004 --> 29:33.605
PITCH.

29:33.671 --> 29:34.506
HE GOT A LOT OF INDEPENDENT

29:34.572 --> 29:35.306
VOTERS, A LOT OF REPUBLICAN

29:35.373 --> 29:35.874
VOTERS WHO VOTED FOR HIM FOR

29:35.940 --> 29:38.176
THAT REASON.

29:38.243 --> 29:40.545
NOW HE'S COME IN WITH A MUCH

29:40.612 --> 29:43.114
MORE AGGRESSIVE AGGRESSIVE

29:43.181 --> 29:44.782
SOCIAL AGENDA THAT HE CAMPAIGNED

29:44.849 --> 29:46.851
ON.

29:46.918 --> 29:50.221
VOTERS KNOW IS IT YOU GOVERN

29:50.288 --> 29:51.189
DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY YOU

29:51.256 --> 29:53.591
CAMPAIGNED, THEY DON'T LIKE IT.

29:53.658 --> 29:54.359
THEY FEEL LIKE WAIT A SECOND I

29:54.425 --> 29:56.127
BOUGHT IT BASED ON WHAT YOU'RE

29:56.194 --> 29:57.795
SELLING, AND I YOU'RE SELLING ON

29:57.862 --> 29:58.263
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

29:58.329 --> 30:00.298
>> Bill: HE DID CAMPAIGN ON A

30:00.365 --> 30:01.332
LOT OF THINGS HE'S SELLING.

30:01.399 --> 30:03.601
>> NOT THEMATICALLY, THAT IS THE

30:03.668 --> 30:04.068
PROBLEM.

30:04.135 --> 30:05.170
PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY WERE GETTING

30:05.236 --> 30:06.237
THIS GUY WHO WAS GOING TO UNITE

30:06.304 --> 30:08.573
THE COUNTRY AND IT'S THAT HE'S

30:08.640 --> 30:09.607
DOING DIFFERENT STUFF.

30:09.674 --> 30:11.376
I THINK ERIC IS RIGHT DEMOCRATS

30:11.442 --> 30:12.443
MADE A HUGE MISTAKE BY NOT

30:12.510 --> 30:13.411
BREAKING DOWN THEIR BILL AND

30:13.478 --> 30:14.746
TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUAL THINGS

30:14.812 --> 30:16.314
AND JUST TALKING ABOUT THE PRICE

30:16.381 --> 30:23.721
TAG, GREAT FOR REPUBLICANS IT.

30:23.788 --> 30:24.255
KEEP

30:24.322 --> 30:24.556
DOING IT TO.

30:24.622 --> 30:26.324
FOR ME, HE HAS GOVERNED CONTRARY

30:26.391 --> 30:27.892
TO THE PLAN HE SOLD AND WHEN YOU

30:27.959 --> 30:30.028
DO THAT AS A POLITICIAN YOU PUT

30:30.094 --> 30:30.428
YOURSELF IN PERIL.

30:56.154 --> 30:57.088
MUST GET ON THE GROUND AND THE

33:44.922 --> 33:48.593
YOUR STATEMENTS, IF YOU COULD

33:48.659 --> 33:49.527
PREVENT DONALD TRUMP FROM BEING

33:49.594 --> 33:50.862
IN OFFICE, I SAID THIS ABOUT

33:50.928 --> 33:51.929
MITT ROMNEY.

33:51.996 --> 33:52.897
I WOULD TAKE THE MILLION DOLLARS

33:52.964 --> 33:54.899
I GAVE TO OBAMA AND GIVE IT TO

33:54.966 --> 33:58.403
YOU OR MITT ROMNEY OR ANYBODY

33:58.469 --> 34:01.339
WHO CAN ASSURE ME THAT YOU WOULD

34:01.406 --> 34:03.841
GET THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION.

34:03.908 --> 34:04.942
>> THAN IT'S BEEN WITH THE

34:05.009 --> 34:07.478
FLIGHT OUT HERE.

34:07.545 --> 34:09.580
[LAUGHTER]

34:09.647 --> 34:12.984
>> Bill: IF YOU CAN WIN.

34:13.050 --> 34:14.152
HERE'S THE PROBLEM, YOU ARE

34:14.218 --> 34:15.787
TRYING TO SQUARE THE CIRCLE THAT

34:15.853 --> 34:17.522
CANNOT BE SQUARED WHICH IS YOU

34:17.588 --> 34:19.524
DON'T WANT TO COMPLETELY

34:19.590 --> 34:19.891
RENOUNCE TRUMP.

34:19.957 --> 34:23.661
THIS BLOWS MY MIND.

34:23.728 --> 34:26.297
YOU SAID "LET'S SEE WHO HE IS."

34:26.364 --> 34:27.331
YOU STILL MIGHT SUPPORT HIM, YOU

34:27.398 --> 34:29.133
CALL HIM OUT FOR THE BIG LIE I

34:29.200 --> 34:31.135
GIVE YOU CREDIT FOR THAT, YOU

34:31.202 --> 34:32.370
CALL OUT THE CONSPIRACY

34:32.437 --> 34:34.138
THEORIES, YOU SAY HE ABSOLUTELY

34:34.205 --> 34:36.107
LOST THE ELECTION BUT THEN YOU

34:36.174 --> 34:37.275
SAY YOU MIGHT SUPPORT HIM IN

34:37.341 --> 34:39.410
2020, LET'S SEE WHO HE IS AND

34:39.477 --> 34:42.580
WHAT HE SAYS AND HOW HE CONDUCTS

34:42.647 --> 34:42.814
HIMSELF.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.749
THIS IS NOT TENABLE FOR A GUY

34:44.816 --> 34:46.083
LIKE YOU WHO IS LIKE I'M NO

34:46.150 --> 34:46.684
BULLSHIT.

34:46.751 --> 34:48.653
YOU KNOW WHO HE IS, YOU THINK IS

34:48.719 --> 34:51.556
GOING TO CHANGE AT 75?

34:51.622 --> 34:53.090
HE DIDN'T CHANGE WHEN HE BECAME

34:53.157 --> 34:55.159
PRESIDENT, THIS WHOLE

34:55.226 --> 34:57.462
DONALD TRUMP MIGHT CHANGE

34:57.528 --> 34:57.929
THEORY?

34:57.995 --> 35:01.933
>> THIS IS WHAT I THINK ABOUT

35:01.999 --> 35:03.134
THAT, BILL.

35:03.201 --> 35:04.702
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WIN AS BADLY

35:04.769 --> 35:06.737
AS HE DOES OFTEN FIND THEIR

35:06.804 --> 35:08.573
PRINCIPLES TO BE FLEXIBLE.

35:08.639 --> 35:10.641
THIS IS A GUY WHO WHEN I FIRST

35:10.708 --> 35:13.110
MET HIM WAS THE MOST PRO-CHOICE

35:13.177 --> 35:14.812
GUY -- HE SAID I'M THE MOST

35:14.879 --> 35:15.746
PRO-CHOICE GUY YOU'LL EVER MEET

35:15.813 --> 35:16.781
AND NOW HE'S THE MOST PRO-LIFE

35:16.848 --> 35:20.117
GUY YOU'LL EVER MEET.

35:20.184 --> 35:21.452
HE WAS TOTALLY AGAINST ETHANOL

35:21.519 --> 35:22.653
SUBSIDIES BECAUSE HE SAID THEY

35:22.720 --> 35:24.288
WERE A WASTE OF MONEY.

35:24.355 --> 35:26.491
>> Bill: PEOPLE DON'T GIVE A

35:26.557 --> 35:28.125
SHIT ABOUT ETHANOL SUBSIDIES,

35:28.192 --> 35:29.060
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT,

35:29.126 --> 35:31.863
COME ON.

35:31.929 --> 35:33.931
LET'S TALK IN NEW JERSEY TO

35:33.998 --> 35:34.732
NEW JERSEY, IT'S NOT ABOUT

35:34.799 --> 35:34.966
ETHANOL.

35:35.032 --> 35:36.934
>> I KNOW THEY DON'T GIVE A

35:37.001 --> 35:38.803
SHIT, I'M TRYING TO MAKE A

35:38.870 --> 35:40.104
BIGGER POINT.

35:40.171 --> 35:43.074
>> Bill: WE GOT HIM GOING!

35:43.140 --> 35:43.941
[LAUGHTER]

35:44.008 --> 35:45.610
>> THAT WORD IS A LOT DIFFERENT

35:45.676 --> 35:46.477
FROM THE OTHER ONE, MY MOTHER

35:46.544 --> 35:49.313
TAUGHT ME THAT!

35:49.380 --> 35:50.648
WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS

35:50.715 --> 35:52.483
WILLING TO CHANGE THEIR

35:52.550 --> 35:53.351
POSITIONS ON SOMETHING LIKE

35:53.417 --> 35:54.519
THAT, I'M NOT ONE WHO'S BEEN

35:54.585 --> 35:55.620
WILLING TO DO THAT, YOU NEVER

35:55.686 --> 35:56.621
KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

35:56.687 --> 35:58.089
IF THIS IS A TRAP.

35:58.155 --> 36:00.491
PEOPLE WANT TO GET YOU IN A TRAP

36:00.558 --> 36:01.692
TO SAY THINGS THAT ARE THREE

36:01.759 --> 36:02.660
YEARS AWAY AND THERE'S NO REASON

36:02.727 --> 36:05.530
FOR ME TO SAY THIS TODAY.

36:05.596 --> 36:07.732
WHAT I AM SAYING IS STUFF THAT

36:07.798 --> 36:09.500
NO ONE ELSE IS SAYING EXCEPT FOR

36:09.567 --> 36:12.169
RUPERT MURDOCH WHO SAID IT

36:12.236 --> 36:12.904
YESTERDAY.

36:12.970 --> 36:15.306
>> Bill: ERIC, HELP ME.

36:15.373 --> 36:17.475
>> YOU NEED HELP?

36:17.542 --> 36:18.943
>> Bill: YOU CAN'T BOTH BE A

36:19.010 --> 36:23.581
MAY BE ON TRUMP AND DEMOCRACY.

36:23.648 --> 36:25.216
YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE ONE.

36:25.283 --> 36:26.751
HE TRIED TO STEAL THE ELECTION

36:26.817 --> 36:29.554
AND YOU CALLED HIM OUT IN EVERY

36:29.620 --> 36:30.454
WAY POSSIBLE, HE CALLED THE

36:30.521 --> 36:31.722
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, HE TRIED TO

36:31.789 --> 36:33.324
GET MIKE PENCE TO DO IT, HE

36:33.391 --> 36:35.927
TRIED TO GET THE COURTS TO DO

36:35.993 --> 36:36.928
IT, HE DID EVERYTHING POSSIBLE.

36:36.994 --> 36:38.563
HE JUST DIDN'T CHEAT HARD

36:38.629 --> 36:40.965
ENOUGH, THAT'S THE ONLY LESSON

36:41.032 --> 36:41.299
HE'S LEARNED.

36:41.365 --> 36:44.435
YOU CAN'T BE "TRUMP IS A BAD GUY

36:44.502 --> 36:45.703
AND I KNOW IT AND I MIGHT VOTE

36:45.770 --> 36:48.906
FOR THEM IN 24."

36:48.973 --> 36:50.508
>> HE'S A BAD GUY, WE DON'T NEED

36:50.575 --> 36:55.980
TO GO BACKWARDS.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.915
WE ARE STILL RECEIVING THE

36:57.982 --> 37:02.420
FALLOUT OF HIS PRESIDENCY AND WE

37:02.486 --> 37:06.490
SHOULD NOT, AND I AM LIGHTING

37:06.557 --> 37:07.892
CANDLES, BURNING INCENSE, DOING

37:07.959 --> 37:08.626
HAIL MARYS, WE DON'T WANT HIM

37:08.693 --> 37:13.497
BACK IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

37:13.564 --> 37:16.834
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

37:16.901 --> 37:17.635
>> Bill: AND WHAT MAKES YOU

37:17.702 --> 37:19.604
THINK YOU CAN PRY THE PARTY AWAY

37:19.670 --> 37:22.239
FROM HIM WHICH HE OWNS?

37:22.306 --> 37:27.545
>> I THINK YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT

37:27.612 --> 37:29.513
THAT, YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN

37:29.580 --> 37:31.148
VIRGINIA, YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED

37:31.215 --> 37:31.716
IN NEW JERSEY.

37:31.782 --> 37:33.050
TWO GUYS AFFIRMATIVELY SAID WE

37:33.117 --> 37:35.186
DON'T WANT YOU TO COME CAMPAIGN

37:35.252 --> 37:37.488
HERE, BOTH OF THEM.

37:37.555 --> 37:39.090
>> Bill: THEY DIDN'T RENOUNCE

37:39.156 --> 37:39.457
HIM.

37:39.523 --> 37:41.525
>> WHEN YOU TELL SOMEBODY DON'T

37:41.592 --> 37:42.960
COME ANYWHERE NEAR ME, THAT'S

37:43.027 --> 37:44.061
WERE ANNOUNCING.

37:44.128 --> 37:45.262
>> Bill: IT'S NOT.

37:45.329 --> 37:47.331
>> IT IS, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO

37:47.398 --> 37:48.532
BE STANDING ANYWHERE NEAR

37:48.599 --> 37:49.734
SOMEBODY, THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.736
A POLL CAME OUT THREE DAYS AGO

37:51.802 --> 37:54.171
IN IOWA, IOWA REPUBLICANS WERE

37:54.238 --> 37:55.039
SOME OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE

37:55.106 --> 37:55.773
REPUBLICANS IN AMERICA THEY

37:55.840 --> 37:57.675
ASKED WHO DO YOU HAVE GREATER

37:57.742 --> 37:59.010
LOYALTY TO COME OF THE

37:59.076 --> 38:04.815
REPUBLICAN PARTY, DONALD TRUMP.

38:04.882 --> 38:07.018
62% SAID THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

38:07.084 --> 38:08.552
HE ABSORBED ALL THE OXYGEN IN

38:08.619 --> 38:10.221
HIS POLITICAL WORLD FOR FIVE

38:10.287 --> 38:11.422
YEARS.

38:11.489 --> 38:12.923
HE'S OUT OF OFFICE TODAY, TEN

38:12.990 --> 38:14.058
MONTHS AND EVERYBODY EXPECTS

38:14.125 --> 38:16.460
EVERYTHING TO BE DIFFERED WITHIN

38:16.527 --> 38:17.928
TEN MONTHS.

38:17.995 --> 38:18.663
IT'S THIS INSTANT GRATIFICATION

38:18.729 --> 38:20.064
SOCIETY WE LIVE IN.

38:20.131 --> 38:21.532
WE ARE MOVING BECAUSE HE IS

38:21.599 --> 38:22.733
FORCING THAT MOVEMENT BECAUSE HE

38:22.800 --> 38:24.368
WON'T LET GO OF THE PAST.

38:24.435 --> 38:25.569
IF YOU WON'T LET GO OF THE PAST

38:25.636 --> 38:27.672
YOU CAN'T BE PART OF THE FUTURE.

38:27.738 --> 38:27.972
[APPLAUSE]

38:28.039 --> 38:30.074
>> I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

38:30.141 --> 38:32.943
WHAT CHRIS IS SAYING.

38:33.010 --> 38:35.680
WE ALLOWED THIS MAN TO REALLY

38:35.746 --> 38:38.916
JUST DISRUPT OUR COUNTRY.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.851
WE WOKE UP EVERY DAY LOOKING AT

38:40.918 --> 38:42.119
HIS TWEETS, WE ALLOWED HIM TO

38:42.186 --> 38:45.289
SUCK THE OXYGEN OUT OF OUR

38:45.356 --> 38:47.658
COUNTRY WHILE WE ARE DEALING

38:47.725 --> 38:51.062
WITH TRUMP CHINA IS KICKING OUR

38:51.128 --> 38:52.697
REAR.

38:52.763 --> 38:54.432
WE NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON OUR

38:54.498 --> 38:55.533
COUNTRY AND WHAT CHRIS IS

38:55.599 --> 38:57.401
SAYING, LET'S NOT FALL INTO THAT

38:57.468 --> 38:59.603
TRAP AGAIN, AMERICA.

38:59.670 --> 38:59.937
HE'S THE PAST.

39:00.004 --> 39:05.543
>> EV EVERYBODY HAS ASKED ME THE

39:05.609 --> 39:06.977
SAME QUESTION YOU DO, NOT GOING

39:07.044 --> 39:09.046
TO FALL INTO THE TRAP OF

39:09.113 --> 39:09.547
SPENDING EVERY MINUTE ON

39:09.613 --> 39:11.315
TELEVISION TALKING ABOUT

39:11.382 --> 39:11.649
DONALD TRUMP.

39:11.716 --> 39:14.051
I WROTE A WHOLE BOOK THAT SAID

39:14.118 --> 39:15.619
THE ELECTION WAS NOT STOLEN,

39:15.686 --> 39:16.620
JOE BIDEN WON FAIR AND SQUARE, I

39:16.687 --> 39:18.155
PROVED IT IN THE BOOK, I GO

39:18.222 --> 39:19.390
THROUGH THESE STATISTICS OF THE

39:19.457 --> 39:20.524
ELECTION AND SAY IF WE DON'T

39:20.591 --> 39:22.159
STOP IT, WE AS A PARTY ARE NOT

39:22.226 --> 39:23.894
GOING TO BE VIABLE, THE MORE

39:23.961 --> 39:27.198
IMPORTANT THAN TALKING ABOUT

39:27.264 --> 39:27.531
DONALD TRUMP.

39:27.598 --> 39:31.368
[APPLAUSE]

39:31.435 --> 39:34.105
>> Bill: DONALD TRUMP IS THAT

39:34.171 --> 39:34.872
PARTY.

39:34.939 --> 39:35.706
LIZ CHENEY IS NOW A

39:35.773 --> 39:39.043
NONREPUBLICAN IN WYOMING.

39:39.110 --> 39:39.577
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IOWA?

39:39.643 --> 39:45.950
I THINK WYOMING IS CONSERVATIVE.

39:46.016 --> 39:46.617
IF THEY DECLARED LIZ CHENEY --

39:46.684 --> 39:51.956
>> A STATE COMMITTEE DID.

39:52.022 --> 39:55.459
>> YOU CAN'T WIN AN ELECTION IN

39:55.526 --> 39:55.693
WYOMING.

39:55.760 --> 39:59.096
>> SHE'S IN A PRIMARY IN 2022

39:59.163 --> 40:00.731
AND I'M PREDICTING RIGHT NOW

40:00.798 --> 40:03.334
SHE'S GOING TO BE RENOMINATED IN

40:03.400 --> 40:03.934
WYOMING.

40:04.001 --> 40:06.103
THEY WILL WERE DETERMINED, THE

40:06.170 --> 40:06.871
VOTERS OF WYOMING, BECAUSE

40:06.937 --> 40:08.072
THAT'S A STATEWIDE RACE BECAUSE

40:08.139 --> 40:10.307
THEY ONLY HAVE ONE MEMBER OF

40:10.374 --> 40:10.674
CONGRESS.

40:10.741 --> 40:12.376
THE VOTERS OF WYOMING WILL

40:12.443 --> 40:13.310
DETERMINE WHO IS A REPUBLICAN

40:13.377 --> 40:14.545
AND WHO ISN'T, NOT A SMOKE OF

40:14.612 --> 40:15.279
THE PEOPLE IN THE STATE

40:15.346 --> 40:17.314
COMMITTEE WHO HAVE A VOTE.

40:17.381 --> 40:19.550
I COULD WIND UP BEING WRONG, I

40:19.617 --> 40:20.484
KNOW I'VE NEVER BEEN WRONG

40:20.551 --> 40:22.153
BEFORE BUT THIS COULD BE THE

40:22.219 --> 40:22.453
FIRST TIME.

40:22.520 --> 40:22.787
[LAUGHTER]

40:22.853 --> 40:24.588
I COULD BE WRONG BUT I THINK I'M

40:24.655 --> 40:25.723
GOING TO BE RIGHT AND I THINK

40:25.790 --> 40:27.992
CHENEY IS GOING TO WIN.

40:28.058 --> 40:29.360
>> Bill: I THINK YOU COULD

40:29.426 --> 40:31.562
HAVE BEEN PRESIDENT IF YOU RAN

40:31.629 --> 40:32.930
THAT YEAR PEOPLE WANTED YOU TO

40:32.997 --> 40:34.665
RUN, THE KNOCK AGAINST YOU WAS

40:34.732 --> 40:37.868
HE'S KIND OF A MOB BOSS BULLY

40:37.935 --> 40:39.436
AND THEN THEY FOUND DONALD TRUMP

40:39.503 --> 40:42.506
A MUCH BIGGER MOB BOSS -- THAT'S

40:42.573 --> 40:43.707
WHAT THEY WANT TO.

40:43.774 --> 40:44.141
[LAUGHTER]

40:44.208 --> 40:45.876
THAT CAN BE GOOD IN POLITICS,

40:45.943 --> 40:47.978
YOU GET THINGS DONE.

40:48.045 --> 40:50.214
HE DIDN'T, YOU POSSIBLY WOULD

40:50.281 --> 40:52.249
BECAUSE YOU CAN WORK WITH THE

40:52.316 --> 40:52.750
OTHER SIDE.

40:52.817 --> 40:54.585
>> AND I DID FOR EIGHT YEARS.

40:54.652 --> 40:59.657
>> Bill: RUNNING AS A SAIN

40:59.723 --> 41:01.358
REPUBLICAN IN THE PART IT IS NO

41:01.425 --> 41:01.659
LONGER SEEN.

41:01.725 --> 41:04.695
QANON IS THE LIFE BLOOD --

41:04.762 --> 41:06.730
>> I WRITE ABOUT THAT IN THE

41:06.797 --> 41:11.535
BOOK, ONCE THEY READ THE BOOK --

41:11.602 --> 41:12.803
>> Bill: THEY ARE NOT GOING TO

41:12.870 --> 41:14.004
READ THE BOOK.

41:14.071 --> 41:15.372
THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS

41:15.439 --> 41:17.474
DON'T READ BOOKS, THEY ARE ON

41:17.541 --> 41:17.775
THEIR PHONE.

41:17.842 --> 41:18.709
>> THAT'S WHAT THE

41:18.776 --> 41:23.047
DEMOCRATIC PARTY MUST DO, THEY

41:23.113 --> 41:23.681
MUST ATTACH DONALD TRUMP TO THE

41:23.747 --> 41:26.317
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

41:26.383 --> 41:26.951
THEY MUST ATTACH HIM TO THAT

41:27.017 --> 41:28.652
PARTY AND IF THEY FAILED TO DO

41:28.719 --> 41:29.520
SO, WE ARE GOING TO FAIL TO

41:29.587 --> 41:32.323
REALLY SHOW THE PROGRESS WE ARE

41:32.389 --> 41:32.823
MAKING IN THIS COUNTRY.

41:32.890 --> 41:35.793
>> THIS IS THE ONLY TIME I'VE

41:35.860 --> 41:36.794
DISAGREED WITH ERIC TONIGHT --

49:34.871 --> 49:35.739
YOUNKIN'S WIN PROVES WHITE

49:35.806 --> 49:37.140
IGNORANCE IS A POWERFUL WEAPON."

49:37.207 --> 49:38.275
"RACISM STILL WORKS IN

49:38.342 --> 49:39.810
VIRGINIA."

49:39.876 --> 49:40.944
"IT'S NOT THE MESSAGING, FOLKS.

49:41.011 --> 49:42.346
THIS COUNTRY SIMPLY LOVES WHITE

49:42.412 --> 49:44.514
SUPREMACY."

49:44.581 --> 49:46.316
I HAVEN'T WORKED UP AN OFFICIAL

49:46.383 --> 49:48.852
DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN SLOGAN FOR

49:48.919 --> 49:51.288
2024 YET, BUT I TELL YOU WHAT I

49:51.355 --> 49:52.289
HAVE RULED OUT IS "VOTE

49:52.356 --> 49:53.090
DEMOCRAT. BECAUSE WHITE PEOPLE

49:53.156 --> 50:03.133
SUCK."

50:03.200 --> 50:04.401
[APPLAUSE]

50:04.468 --> 50:05.335
IT'S LIKE TRYING TO GET LAID BY

50:05.402 --> 50:06.269
SAYING, "YOU'RE UGLY -- DO YOU

50:06.336 --> 50:07.170
WANT TO DANCE?"

50:07.237 --> 50:08.138
YOU'RE ALIENATING A WHOLE LOT OF

50:08.205 --> 50:09.373
PEOPLE.

50:09.439 --> 50:10.640
PARTICULARLY WHITES WITHOUT A

50:10.707 --> 50:11.675
COLLEGE DEGREE, WHICH IS MOST OF

50:11.742 --> 50:12.709
THEM.

50:12.776 --> 50:13.610
IN A COUNTRY THAT'S STILL 70%

50:13.677 --> 50:14.811
WHITE.

50:14.878 --> 50:16.413
I'D SAY "DO THE MATH," BUT MATH

50:16.480 --> 50:23.787
IS A FORM OF WHITE SUPREMACY.

50:23.854 --> 50:24.054
[LAUGHTER]

50:24.121 --> 50:24.855
[APPLAUSE]

50:24.921 --> 50:25.856
YES, I KNOW, EVERY FIBER OF YOUR

50:25.922 --> 50:27.190
BEING TELLS YOU THE PEOPLE YOU

50:27.257 --> 50:28.592
REALLY WANT TO REACH ARE

50:28.658 --> 50:29.693
GUATEMALAN TEENAGERS AND

50:29.760 --> 50:31.027
BLOGGERS IN GAZA, BUT THEY CAN'T

50:31.094 --> 50:33.697
VOTE.

50:33.764 --> 50:35.899
TO A LOT OF FOLKS YOU COME

50:35.966 --> 50:37.234
ACROSS AS THE "CARES ABOUT

50:37.300 --> 50:40.003
EVERYBODY BUT ME" PARTY.

50:40.070 --> 50:41.338
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY

50:41.405 --> 50:43.573
-- YOU CAN FIND WAYS TO STAND UP

50:43.640 --> 50:44.708
FOR THEM WITHOUT BEING DAVID

50:44.775 --> 50:46.042
DUKE.

50:46.109 --> 50:47.444
THIS MONTH WHEN THE DEMOCRATS

50:47.511 --> 50:50.614
FINALLY PASSED THEIR BIG

50:50.680 --> 50:51.782
TRILLION-DOLLAR TO REBUILD OUR

50:51.848 --> 50:53.583
ROADS AND BRIDGES SIX DEMOCRATS

50:53.650 --> 50:54.918
VOTED "NO" BECAUSE IT DIDN'T GO

50:54.985 --> 50:57.554
FAR ENOUGH TO ADDRESS CLIMATE

50:57.621 --> 50:59.055
CHANGE, WHICH I'M SURE IS TRUE

50:59.122 --> 51:01.091
-- WHAT DOES?

51:01.158 --> 51:02.492
BUT THIS WAS FREE MONEY FROM THE

51:02.559 --> 51:03.326
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD

51:03.393 --> 51:04.694
ACTUALLY IMPROVE THEIR

51:04.761 --> 51:06.863
CONSTITUENTS' LIVES.

51:06.930 --> 51:09.132
I CAN SEE A VOTER SAYING, "YOU

51:09.199 --> 51:11.635
KNOW, SQUAD, I AGREE WITH YOU ON

51:11.701 --> 51:12.869
CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT AS LONG AS

51:12.936 --> 51:14.237
IT IS HAPPENING, WE ALSO NEED

51:14.304 --> 51:15.238
MONEY FOR GETTING THE WATER

51:15.305 --> 51:17.040
PUMPED OUT OF THE SUBWAY.

51:17.107 --> 51:18.375
CAN WE DO THAT BEFORE WE BUILD

51:18.442 --> 51:22.612
THE WORKERS' PARADISE?"

51:22.679 --> 51:24.347
[APPLAUSE]

51:24.414 --> 51:25.715
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS BIDEN

51:25.782 --> 51:27.818
DID IN OFFICE WAS GETTING

51:27.884 --> 51:29.953
THROUGH A COVID "RELIEF" PACKAGE

51:30.020 --> 51:31.254
THAT SENT 1,400 DOLLARS TO,

51:31.321 --> 51:33.056
WELL, EVERYBODY.

51:33.123 --> 51:34.224
WITHOUT A SINGLE REPUBLICAN

51:34.291 --> 51:35.692
VOTE.

51:35.759 --> 51:37.561
AND TODAY TRUMP IS LEADING HIM

51:37.627 --> 51:39.596
IN THE POLLS.

51:39.663 --> 51:40.931
YOU CAN GIVE THE PEOPLE ALL THE

51:40.997 --> 51:42.933
GOODIES JOE MANCHIN WILL ALLOW,

51:42.999 --> 51:44.234
AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BUY THEIR

51:44.301 --> 51:45.735
LOVE.

51:45.802 --> 51:47.370
WHY?

51:47.437 --> 51:48.872
WHY IS THE PARTY THAT SUPPORTS

51:48.939 --> 51:51.408
SO MANY ISSUES THAT BENEFIT THE

51:51.475 --> 51:52.008
MIDDLE CLASS STILL CONSIDERED

51:52.075 --> 51:53.076
"OUT OF TOUCH" BY 62% OF

51:53.143 --> 51:55.512
AMERICANS?

51:55.579 --> 51:57.013
IN PLAIN ENGLISH, NOBODY LIKES A

51:57.080 --> 51:59.816
SNOB.

51:59.883 --> 52:01.184
HILLARY CLINTON DIDN'T HAVE

52:01.251 --> 52:02.686
ANYONE ON RURAL RESEARCH OR

52:02.752 --> 52:04.988
OUTREACH WHEN SHE RAN IN 2016.

52:05.055 --> 52:06.823
UNTIL THE RACE TIGHTENED JUST

52:06.890 --> 52:07.757
BEFORE THE ELECTION, THEN THEY

52:07.824 --> 52:08.658
HIRED ONE.

52:08.725 --> 52:09.893
AND WHERE WAS HIS OFFICE?

52:09.960 --> 52:13.697
BROOKLYN.

52:13.763 --> 52:13.964
[LAUGHTER]

52:14.030 --> 52:14.698
TRUE STORY.

52:14.764 --> 52:16.766
POLITICS IS LOCAL, NOT LOCALLY

52:16.833 --> 52:17.968
SOURCED.

52:18.034 --> 52:19.202
IT'S NOT ARTISAN -- IT'S ART AND

52:19.269 --> 52:27.544
STAN.

52:27.611 --> 52:28.745
[APPLAUSE]

52:28.812 --> 52:29.679
YOUR MICROAGGRESSION CULTURE

52:29.746 --> 52:31.615
DOESN'T PLAY IN THE RUST BELT.

52:31.681 --> 52:33.283
IF A STAFFER HANDS YOU A SPEECH

52:33.350 --> 52:36.486
THAT SAYS "MENSTRUATING PEOPLE"

52:36.553 --> 52:39.089
INSTEAD OF "WOMEN," DON'T SAY

52:39.155 --> 52:39.856
THAT.

52:39.923 --> 52:44.594
SAY. "WOMEN."

52:44.661 --> 52:46.129
[APPLAUSE]

52:46.196 --> 52:47.297
DON'T PUT ANYONE FRESH OUT OF

52:47.364 --> 52:48.098
COLLEGE IN CHARGE OF THE

52:48.164 --> 52:50.100
CAMPAIGN.

52:50.166 --> 52:51.134
THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN PARTICIPATION

52:51.201 --> 52:52.235
TROPHIES THEIR WHOLE LIFE, THEY

52:52.302 --> 52:59.543
DON'T KNOW HOW TO WIN.

52:59.609 --> 52:59.809
[LAUGHTER]

52:59.876 --> 53:00.076
[APPLAUSE]

53:00.143 --> 53:01.311
JAMES CARVILLE KNEW HOW TO WIN,

53:01.378 --> 53:03.146
AND HE BLAMED THE DEMOCRATIC

53:03.213 --> 53:05.482
LOSSES THIS NOVEMBER 2ND ON

53:05.549 --> 53:08.051
"STUPID WOKENESS," TO WHICH AOC

53:08.118 --> 53:09.753
FIRED BACK THAT WOKENESS "IS A

53:09.819 --> 53:11.087
TERM ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY USED BY

53:11.154 --> 53:13.123
OLDER PEOPLE THESE DAYS," SO

53:13.189 --> 53:13.690
THAT SHOULD TELL YOU ALL YOU

53:13.757 --> 53:15.325
NEED TO KNOW."

53:15.392 --> 53:17.294
WHAT?

53:17.360 --> 53:19.796
THIS IS A TERM FOLKS LIKE YOU

53:19.863 --> 53:21.731
BROUGHT OUT VERY RECENTLY AND

53:21.798 --> 53:23.600
HAD BEEN PROUDLY DISPLAYING AT

53:23.667 --> 53:25.335
EVERY MARCH SINCE.

53:25.402 --> 53:27.337
JUST LAST YEAR THE GUARDIAN

53:27.404 --> 53:28.838
DECLARED "WOKE" "THE WORD OF OUR

53:28.905 --> 53:29.839
ERA" -- I GUESS THEY DIDN'T GET

53:29.906 --> 53:30.740
THE MEMO FROM THE MEAN GIRLS

53:30.807 --> 53:33.209
CLUB.

53:33.276 --> 53:35.879
WE DON'T USE THAT EMOJI ANYMORE.

53:35.946 --> 53:36.947
"WOKE"?

53:37.013 --> 53:44.955
PLEASE, WE SAY "FETCH" NOW.

53:45.021 --> 53:45.221
[LAUGHTER]

53:45.288 --> 53:46.456
[APPLAUSE]

53:46.523 --> 53:47.624
WHAT A GREAT STRATEGY, NEVER

53:47.691 --> 53:48.959
MISSING AN OPPORTUNITY TO REMIND

53:49.025 --> 53:51.394
VOTERS HOW LAME AND CLUELESS AND

53:51.461 --> 53:53.730
HOPELESSLY UNCOOL THEY ARE,

53:53.797 --> 53:55.231
ESPECIALLY SINCE THOSE ARE THE

53:55.298 --> 53:57.701
ONES WHO VOTE.

53:57.767 --> 53:59.836
BUT OKAY, FINE, WHAT WORD WOULD

53:59.903 --> 54:01.571
YOU LIKE US TO USE FOR THE

54:01.638 --> 54:04.007
PLAINLY INSANE EXCESSES OF THE

54:04.074 --> 54:05.842
LEFT THAT ARE NOT LIBERALISM BUT

54:05.909 --> 54:07.477
SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT?

54:07.544 --> 54:09.879
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE THE WORD

54:09.946 --> 54:11.014
LIBERAL FROM US AND THINK IT

54:11.081 --> 54:12.916
SHOULD COVER THINGS LIKE

54:12.983 --> 54:14.351
CANCELLING LINCOLN AND TEACHING

54:14.417 --> 54:17.520
3RD GRADERS THEY'RE OPPRESSORS.

54:17.587 --> 54:20.991
THAT'S ALL YOUR NEW THING.

54:21.057 --> 54:22.959
[APPLAUSE]

54:23.026 --> 54:23.793
A MORE PERTINENT QUESTION TO ASK

54:23.860 --> 54:24.928
ABOUT THE WORD WOKE MIGHT BE,

54:24.995 --> 54:26.096
"WHY, IN SUCH A SHORT TIME HAS

54:26.162 --> 54:27.931
IT GONE FROM A RALLYING CRY TO A

54:27.998 --> 54:30.333
PEJORATIVE?"

54:30.400 --> 54:31.434
IF THE WORD ONLY MADE YOU THINK

54:31.501 --> 54:34.604
OF RATIONAL, DESERVED CAUSES

54:34.671 --> 54:36.973
LIKE TEACHING A LESS WHITEWASHED

54:37.040 --> 54:39.009
VERSION OF AMERICAN HISTORY, AOC

54:39.075 --> 54:42.445
WOULD STILL WANT TO OWN IT.

54:42.512 --> 54:43.480
BUT IT'S A JOKE BECAUSE IT MAKES

54:43.546 --> 54:49.019
YOU THINK OF PEOPLE WHO WAKE UP

54:49.085 --> 54:51.421
OFFENDED AND TAKE ORDERS FROM

54:51.488 --> 54:52.088
TWITTER.

54:52.155 --> 54:52.956
AND THEIR OVERSENSITIVITY HAS

54:53.023 --> 54:56.059
GROWN TIRESOME.

54:56.126 --> 54:57.661
THAT SAID, I'D LOVE TO HAVE AOC

54:57.727 --> 54:59.295
ON THIS SHOW, THERE'S MUCH TO

54:59.362 --> 55:00.597
ADMIRE THERE, I WAS ONE OF HER

55:00.664 --> 55:02.732
FIRST SUPPORTERS FOR THE GREEN

55:02.799 --> 55:04.701
NEW DEAL IDEA -- BUT THAT WILL

55:04.768 --> 55:06.102
PROBABLY NEVER HAPPEN BECAUSE

55:06.169 --> 55:07.637
DEMOCRATS DON'T GO ANYWHERE

55:07.704 --> 55:09.305
THESE DAYS WHERE THEY'RE NOT

55:09.372 --> 55:10.740
PRE-ADORED -- AND THAT'S MY LAST

55:10.807 --> 55:13.043
BIT OF ADVICE TO THEM.

55:13.109 --> 55:14.778
GO WHERE THE AMEN CORNER ISN'T.

55:14.844 --> 55:16.346
DO FOX NEWS.

55:16.413 --> 55:17.280
BE BRAVE.

55:17.347 --> 55:18.281
COME HERE.

55:18.348 --> 55:19.482
GO EVERYWHERE.

55:19.549 --> 55:21.451
WINNING IS ABOUT EXPANDING THE

55:21.518 --> 55:24.788
ELECTORATE.

55:24.854 --> 55:25.255
OKAY, THAT'S OUR SHOW.

55:25.321 --> 55:26.289
WE'RE OFF TIL JANUARY 21ST!

55:26.356 --> 55:27.323
TIL THEN I'LL BE AT THE MAUI
