Are you sure?
Yep. They're covered
in peanut butter.

08:33.844 --> 08:35.556
He uses them
to scrape the
bottom of the jar.

Maybe Jorge was
telling the truth.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.812
He doesn't go anywhere
without his glasses.
That's true.

08:41.812 --> 08:45.946
He can't see
without them.
Or eat peanut butter.

08:45.946 --> 08:52.152

This is Zuri's "Reba Is
My Co-Pilot" money clip!

08:52.152 --> 08:53.954

go anywhere
without that.

08:59.960 --> 09:03.003

all the  Slaughter Camp
movies begin!

09:03.003 --> 09:05.545
Except for  Slaughter
Camp Six, which
was a musical comedy,

and a real low point
in the franchise.

Zuri, Tiffany,

gone missing!

09:31.822 --> 09:33.533
You have to call
the police!

09:33.533 --> 09:35.405
And you might want to
wipe your face before
they get here.

09:35.405 --> 09:36.997
You know, so the
cops don't think
you ate them.

09:37.908 --> 09:40.460
You didn't,
did you?

09:40.460 --> 09:42.502
Those kids are just
messing with you.

09:42.502 --> 09:45.255
The only thing that's
missing around here
is a few stray cats.

Hint, they're in
the nachos.

09:48.128 --> 09:49.840

09:49.840 --> 09:51.882
I can't believe Gladys
wouldn't listen to us!

09:51.882 --> 09:57.017
I can. In every horror movie,
the authority figure never
believes the frightened teens.

09:57.017 --> 10:00.350
Though said figure does tend
to get gutted like a fish
late in the second act.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.102
So, it evens out.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.564
Okay. Okay, we'll have
to handle this ourselves.

10:04.564 --> 10:07.397
We need to split up.
No! Never split up.

10:07.397 --> 10:10.030
That is a classic
horror movie miscalculation.

10:10.030 --> 10:13.403
It will give the killer
the opportunity to pick
us off one by one.

10:13.403 --> 10:17.077
Forget the movie! Emma
and I will get a cellphone
from Gladys's cabin.

10:17.077 --> 10:19.289
And Ravi and I will
search the camp for
any signs of the kids.

10:19.289 --> 10:22.042
Meet at the mess hall
in 10 minutes, got it?
Got it!

10:22.042 --> 10:23.503
Wait!

10:23.503 --> 10:26.206
Just in case you're
right about this
horror movie thing,

10:26.206 --> 10:29.459
what happens
to the goofy,
good-natured gal?

10:29.459 --> 10:31.171
Actually, she makes it
to the end of the movie.

10:31.171 --> 10:32.963
Oh, really?
Until finally
meeting her doom.

10:32.963 --> 10:35.055

farm implement.

10:36.346 --> 10:38.138
Okay, you're searching
the tool shed.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.812
We have to find
a phone!

10:41.812 --> 10:44.604
(GASPS) Look,
the cellphone bag
is under her bed!

10:44.604 --> 10:47.818
Right next to several copies
of  Mountain Man Monthly.

10:49.820 --> 10:52.152
(SCREAMING)
Emma, what is it?

10:52.152 --> 10:55.325
My case is scratched!
(SIGHS)

10:55.325 --> 10:57.117
Okay. We really need
to have a discussion

10:57.117 --> 10:59.279
about when it's
appropriate to scream.

10:59.279 --> 11:01.541
Call the police!
Okay.

11:01.541 --> 11:04.124
(DOOR CLOSES)
What are you doing
in my cabin?

11:04.124 --> 11:07.047
Have you two been messing
with one of my Morgan Ross
hand puppets?

11:07.047 --> 11:09.209
You have a hand puppet
of my dad?

11:09.209 --> 11:11.131
More than one?

11:11.131 --> 11:13.133
What?
Nothing.
Never mind.

11:13.133 --> 11:15.295
Are you trying to
use your cellphones?

11:15.295 --> 11:17.387
Gladys, we have
to call the cops!

11:17.387 --> 11:19.179
Oh, for cryin'
out loud!

11:19.179 --> 11:20.851
I can't believe you
two don't know when
you're being tricked.

11:20.851 --> 11:22.562
Now, get out
of my cabin.

11:22.562 --> 11:23.563
(BOTH SCOFF)

11:25.355 --> 11:27.147
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

11:28.148 --> 11:30.310
Back off, Fireman Morgan.

11:30.310 --> 11:32.072
Gladys is my woman!

11:32.072 --> 11:35.575
No, she's not,
Construction Worker Morgan.
She's my woman.

11:35.575 --> 11:38.078
(CHUCKLES)
Oh, boys, boys,
please...

11:38.078 --> 11:39.319
You're going to
have to get along,

11:39.319 --> 11:43.533
especially if Astronaut Morgan
is going to join us later.

11:43.533 --> 11:47.037
(GIGGLING)
Oh, hey... Oh.

11:47.037 --> 11:48.999
Okay, we're going
to have to run
to town to get help!

11:48.999 --> 11:50.670
Let's go tell
Lou and Ravi!

11:50.670 --> 11:52.212
(BOTH GASP AND SCREAM)

11:58.759 --> 12:00.640
There's no sign of Zuri,
Jorge, or Tiffany!

12:00.640 --> 12:02.642
It's like they vanished
into thin air!

12:02.642 --> 12:04.184
This is terrible!

12:04.184 --> 12:06.897
I have been wishing
Jorge would disappear
since I met him,

12:06.897 --> 12:11.061
and now that it has
really happened,
I'm kind of sad about it.

12:11.061 --> 12:13.353
Where's Emma and Xander?
They should have
been here by now!

12:13.353 --> 12:15.115
No sign of them either.

12:15.115 --> 12:19.159
But in horror movies, the
overly affectionate couple
always ends up dead.

12:19.159 --> 12:22.162
Frankly, I am surprised
they made it this long.

12:22.162 --> 12:25.365
I can't believe this
is happening! Who would
do such a thing?

12:25.365 --> 12:27.577
(CREAKING)
Hide!
He's coming for us!

12:29.499 --> 12:32.172
Oh, relax.
It is just Murphy.

when the kids are jerks?

12:45.976 --> 12:47.647
(SNIFFLES)
Did you hear that?

12:47.647 --> 12:51.691
Indeed. That was
totally off key.

12:51.691 --> 12:54.985
No! I mean, what if
Murphy is the killer?

12:54.985 --> 12:57.657
He has access to knives.
He said we'd "pay"
for ruining his sauce.

12:57.657 --> 12:59.950
And now he's singing
a song about
chopping up kids!

13:00.660 --> 13:02.532
That is impossible.

13:02.532 --> 13:05.906
Think about it. Murphy has
been slowly poisoning us
with his horrible food.

13:05.906 --> 13:07.457
Maybe after what we
did to him this morning,

13:07.457 --> 13:09.870
he decided to speed
up the process.

13:09.870 --> 13:12.963
No, I mean, it is
impossible because
in horror movies,

13:12.963 --> 13:14.714
it is never the most
obvious suspect.

13:14.714 --> 13:16.256
Really?
Yes.

13:16.256 --> 13:17.547
Just like in
Slaughter Camp Seven

13:17.547 --> 13:20.260
when the killer turned
out to be an
enraged dandelion.

13:20.260 --> 13:21.882
Not only was it
a brilliant twist,

13:21.882 --> 13:24.224
but also an insightful
commentary
on global warming.

13:24.224 --> 13:25.225
(THUDDING)

13:28.188 --> 13:31.191
Hurry, help!
I am hurrying.

13:31.191 --> 13:33.023
We must run
to town to get help!

13:33.023 --> 13:34.895
Hang on, I left
my flashlight
in the mess hall.

13:34.895 --> 13:36.276
I'll be right back.

13:36.276 --> 13:38.568
Never say,
"I will be right back!"

(PANTING)

13:51.912 --> 13:54.294
Have to get to town
to get the police!

13:54.294 --> 13:58.298
If I meet my demise,
whoever finds this, please
show it to the authorities

13:58.298 --> 14:00.510
and upload it
to the internet.

14:00.510 --> 14:03.133
If I must die, it would be
nice to at least go viral.

Dude, TMI.

14:43.343 --> 14:46.927
Timmy? Wait!
You are the killer?

14:46.927 --> 14:49.179
Relax!
There is no killer.

14:49.179 --> 14:51.311
Everyone is safe
in the barn.

thank goodness!

14:54.894 --> 14:57.397
Ravi, why are
your pants all wet?

14:57.397 --> 14:59.019

15:07.117 --> 15:09.579

just an elaborate prank?

15:09.579 --> 15:11.081
Yup.

15:11.081 --> 15:13.453
Hey, Ravi!
Sit in another puddle?

15:13.453 --> 15:16.296

get revenge on Gladys for
kicking him out of camp.

it look like we've
all been murdered,

15:21.671 --> 15:23.883
and that the crazy killer
is coming after Gladys.

it was bread.

they want to die!

for the last time,

15:45.865 --> 15:50.030

of Blake Shelton"
is not an option.

make the phone call.

in the name of

were you burying
in the woods?

the barbecue. I can't
burn it anymore.

You do?
Yes.

to come back

for what I've done,

21:47.727 --> 21:50.430
I'm going to spend
every single second

21:50.430 --> 21:53.643
of every single day
with you. (CHUCKLES)

21:53.643 --> 21:56.235
What? I'd rather go
back to the woods!

21:59.739 --> 22:01.741
I think he made
the right choice.
