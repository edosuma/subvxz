01:00.908 --> 01:02.533
Authorities in Australia report that

01:02.675 --> 01:06.539
the solar storm electromagnetic
pulse overloaded power stations

01:06.675 --> 01:09.232
all along Australia's eastern coast.

01:11.508 --> 01:14.269
Though the storm occurred some
hours after sundown local time,

01:14.408 --> 01:16.465
the high energy burst
was apparently diverted

01:16.608 --> 01:18.403
around the curvature of the earth

01:18.541 --> 01:20.666
to strike Sydney after dark.

01:23.107 --> 01:25.266
The young woman was killed instantly.

01:25.408 --> 01:26.601
Call an ambulance!

01:27.074 --> 01:29.802
Now the intensity and
effect of this solar storm

01:29.941 --> 01:32.499
is reminiscent of
the geomagnetic storm

01:32.641 --> 01:36.733
that was a result of a cordial
mass eject on March 9th 1989,

01:36.875 --> 01:39.965
that knocked out power in the
Canadian province of Quebec.

01:40.107 --> 01:41.801
That storm originated on earth

01:41.941 --> 01:45.897
with extremely intense aurora's
at both poles that were visible as

01:46.041 --> 01:47.337
Really? -Uh huh

01:47.474 --> 01:49.337
Well l know we're going through
a peak in the solar cycle,

01:49.474 --> 01:51.133
but it generated a storm.

01:51.274 --> 01:53.467
Does this change anything
for the flight tomorrow?

01:55.141 --> 01:56.198
l don't think so.

01:56.341 --> 01:57.329
Hum

02:00.907 --> 02:01.874
Go home.

02:02.441 --> 02:04.236
Go to sleep. l need you tomorrow.

02:04.374 --> 02:07.306
You're on launch diagnostic systems
and fuel disbursement back ups.

02:07.441 --> 02:08.770
l need you.

02:08.907 --> 02:11.840
When you talk like that,
it really turns me on.

02:11.974 --> 02:15.168
So come on, let's just go back to your
place and order some Chinese.

02:15.308 --> 02:16.296
We just take.

02:16.441 --> 02:18.669
Fine, let's just go back to your
place and do more tech talk

02:18.808 --> 02:19.831
Denise.

02:19.974 --> 02:23.168
l know, I'm too young,
l could get hurt, yadda, yadda, yadda.

02:23.308 --> 02:25.171
Listen. l told you when
we started working together,

02:25.308 --> 02:26.933
you don't want to
hang out with me. OK.

02:27.074 --> 02:27.597
You remember that.

02:27.741 --> 02:29.866
Ya. l thought you were
just being mysterious.

02:30.474 --> 02:32.235
How was l supposed to know
you were incapable of lying?

02:32.374 --> 02:33.237
l told you that, too.

02:33.374 --> 02:37.965
Yes. You did.You told me that. Yes.

02:41.641 --> 02:43.072
Do you know

02:43.208 --> 02:46.140
that biologically that two people
can tell a lot from each other

02:46.274 --> 02:49.502
by the transfer of genetic information
that occurs from kissing.

02:49.808 --> 02:52.706
It's a miracle of Darwinian selection.

02:52.842 --> 02:54.831
What's my DNA telling you right now?

02:55.775 --> 02:58.434
That uh, one day I'm going to get to you

02:58.575 --> 03:00.473
and when l do you're going
to be in big trouble.

03:04.708 --> 03:07.867
OK. Won't be the first time
a kiss got me in trouble.

03:10.341 --> 03:11.170
Thanks

03:24.041 --> 03:27.769
Whoa. Slow down. Don't you
think we're moving a little fast?

03:27.907 --> 03:29.100
No, and now kiss me.

03:30.141 --> 03:31.834
No. Hey it's only been our third date.

03:31.974 --> 03:33.099
You want a fourth one? Kiss me.

03:33.241 --> 03:34.138
We don't have a lot of time.

03:34.274 --> 03:35.672
Uh, until what?

03:53.274 --> 03:54.331
What the hell!

03:56.675 --> 03:57.663
Tempo is recovered.

03:57.807 --> 03:58.966
Returning to castle.

03:59.107 --> 04:01.733
Tempo? l thought you told me
your name was Lara Smith?

04:03.041 --> 04:04.439
Miss Mathany, please come with us.

04:08.074 --> 04:11.006
Mathany? Lara Mathany?

04:13.107 --> 04:14.970
I've been dating
the president's daughter?

04:15.107 --> 04:16.630
Ugh! Ugh!

04:20.107 --> 04:21.266
Awesome!

04:29.208 --> 04:31.003
Making out with some boy
in the back seat of car.

04:31.141 --> 04:32.004
Really?

04:32.575 --> 04:33.767
Nothing happened.

04:34.708 --> 04:37.867
Hey, you just slipped your secret
service detail and you just ran off.

04:39.074 --> 04:40.972
do you even realize
the risk you put yourself at?

04:41.907 --> 04:43.373
l was being discrete.

04:43.508 --> 04:44.633
You're the president's daughter.

04:44.774 --> 04:46.502
You're held to a higher standard.

04:47.508 --> 04:50.940
l didn't ask for any of that.
l want a normal life.

04:51.074 --> 04:52.097
Well you can have one in a year.

04:52.241 --> 04:53.502
Five if I'm re-elected.

04:53.641 --> 04:56.607
We'll talk about your
behavior when l get back.

04:56.740 --> 04:58.070
Wish me luck.

04:58.208 --> 05:00.333
Ya. Good luck on your publicity stunt.

05:00.474 --> 05:01.531
Hey! Hey!

05:01.675 --> 05:03.072
It's OK. Just leave her.

05:05.174 --> 05:06.572
Were you like that at sixteen?

05:07.174 --> 05:11.266
Worse. You're sure
this is going to be safe?

05:13.807 --> 05:15.603
Roebling's a genius.

05:15.740 --> 05:17.468
He's poached the best minds from NASA.

05:17.608 --> 05:20.472
This program better funded
than any other government agency.

05:20.608 --> 05:22.073
I'd go in a second if l could.

05:22.208 --> 05:23.231
l know.

05:23.641 --> 05:25.573
Well, I'll see you Thursday.

05:31.141 --> 05:32.630
l don't think l hold you enough.

05:34.608 --> 05:35.937
so hold me now.

05:59.974 --> 06:04.168
Well l am really excited for you and,
no l really am.

06:04.308 --> 06:06.240
Ya, no l am. Really, ya.

06:06.374 --> 06:08.465
Ya, l think he's just trying to
make up for the G force test

06:08.608 --> 06:09.834
he put me through.

06:09.974 --> 06:11.065
Well l think that's what you get

06:11.208 --> 06:13.606
when you're the oldest
member of the group, right?

06:13.740 --> 06:15.001
does your back still hurt?

06:15.141 --> 06:16.731
Uh, now it's my shoulder.

06:18.707 --> 06:21.367
Um, one second. Can you wait? Paul?

06:21.508 --> 06:21.973
Ya?

06:22.107 --> 06:24.505
Can you just, um,
take care of these guys?

06:24.641 --> 06:26.231
Sure. Ya.

06:28.107 --> 06:34.404
You know, um, if you think it's too
much for you, you could pull out.

06:35.374 --> 06:38.828
No way. We both know
what the camp runs on.

06:39.308 --> 06:42.138
Food, used clothing donations.

06:42.274 --> 06:42.762
Publicity.

06:42.907 --> 06:44.464
And this little trip of mine
is going to raise awareness

06:44.608 --> 06:48.165
for our work to new heights.
Literally.

06:48.674 --> 06:52.368
Just come back soon,
preferably in one piece. Hmm.

06:53.208 --> 06:54.538
Did you hear from JJ?

06:56.107 --> 06:59.834
No. No, l thought he'd at
least call and wish me luck.

07:00.441 --> 07:01.338
Wow.

07:03.774 --> 07:04.797
Mr. Elias?

07:06.141 --> 07:09.834
l gotta go. I'll call when I'm back.

07:10.907 --> 07:11.736
OK.

07:15.740 --> 07:16.933
Good morning everyone.

07:17.074 --> 07:17.869
Morning

07:18.007 --> 07:20.200
My name is Peter Roebling,

07:20.341 --> 07:26.069
and l want to welcome you to
this the most exciting day of,

07:26.208 --> 07:28.367
well the most exciting
day of all our lives.

07:30.508 --> 07:35.270
Today marks the beginning of
a new era in civilian space flight.

07:35.408 --> 07:39.500
No longer will man flights belong
exclusively to governments

07:39.640 --> 07:40.970
or special interests.

07:41.107 --> 07:46.301
As of today,
space belongs to the people.

07:46.907 --> 07:47.838
Ya!

07:52.141 --> 07:55.335
Now l would like to
introduce Dr. Craig Bakus,

07:55.474 --> 07:57.564
formerly a senior engineer with NASA

07:57.707 --> 08:01.470
but now Roebling Spaceport's
designer and head engineer.

08:01.607 --> 08:03.301
He's going to talk
you through today's flight.

08:06.308 --> 08:07.399
Thank you Peter and thank you all

08:07.540 --> 08:10.473
for coming out today
and good morning.

08:11.607 --> 08:13.573
The Roebling Clipper is without a doubt

08:13.707 --> 08:16.173
the most advanced
civilian aircraft ever built.

08:16.308 --> 08:18.739
It's designed to take off and fly
just like a regular airplane

08:18.874 --> 08:21.999
but also to be able to leave and
re enter the earth's atmosphere.

08:22.141 --> 08:24.300
Taking off from our
runway just outside here

08:24.441 --> 08:25.906
command pilot Fiona Henslaw.

08:26.041 --> 08:28.337
Let's give her a hand. Thank you.

08:30.807 --> 08:33.773
she'll take the Clipper up to
an altitude of 50,000 feet.

08:33.907 --> 08:35.668
And from there she'll fire a rocket,

08:35.807 --> 08:40.433
that will take her and the Clipper up to
seventy miles above the earth's surface.

08:40.573 --> 08:42.539
Hey, Jeff Gustas, WLDQ Network.

08:42.674 --> 08:43.197
Hi Jeff.

08:43.341 --> 08:46.829
Craig, is this the scalar drive
we've been hearing about?

08:46.974 --> 08:49.872
Ah, no. It's not the scalar drive,
it's a special hybrid,

08:50.007 --> 08:51.632
designed to get us into low orbit.

08:51.774 --> 08:54.104
And once we are in low orbit
we'd fire the scalar drive.

08:54.241 --> 08:56.002
John Davis CNJ News.

08:56.141 --> 08:58.073
Can you tell us the difference
between a scalar drive

08:58.208 --> 09:00.037
and a regular rocket engine?

09:00.174 --> 09:01.503
That's a good question.

09:01.640 --> 09:04.004
Well a regular rocket engine burns fuel.

09:04.141 --> 09:06.130
So no fuel, no propulsion,

09:06.274 --> 09:08.865
but the scalar drive
uses solar radiation.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.700
And there's plenty of
that in out in space.

09:10.841 --> 09:11.864
Let me tell ya.

09:12.540 --> 09:16.166
Think of the scalar drive a little
bit like a music amplifier,

09:16.308 --> 09:18.569
but instead of making your
neighbor's tunes louder,

09:18.707 --> 09:19.730
what is does is that

09:19.874 --> 09:23.170
it takes the energy from radiation
and it amps that up.

09:23.740 --> 09:26.706
Take bad music put it into an amplifier
and you get a headache,

09:26.841 --> 09:28.171
take solar radiation,

09:28.308 --> 09:31.831
you put it into the scalar drive
and you get massive acceleration.

09:31.974 --> 09:33.940
Cindy Powers, NTX News.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.801
How fast are you talking about?

09:35.941 --> 09:38.203
One thousand
three hundred miles a minute.

09:38.341 --> 09:43.296
Which is about one ten thousandth of
the speed of light. And that's a ...

09:43.807 --> 09:46.171
well that's ah pretty damn fast.
Isn't it?

09:47.241 --> 09:48.229
The trip around the moon

09:48.374 --> 09:51.067
and back today should take
just under seven hours.

09:51.607 --> 09:54.767
Dr. Bakus. ls scalar technology safe?

09:55.574 --> 09:59.098
It's about as safe as your drive
out here today Jeff. Maybe safer.

10:00.107 --> 10:01.504
Thank you Dr. Bakus.

10:02.507 --> 10:03.871
Thank you. -Well done.

10:10.841 --> 10:13.239
Joan? She just walked in.

10:14.274 --> 10:16.365
Ahh family? Parents?

10:17.174 --> 10:18.162
l don't know.

10:21.440 --> 10:22.463
Nourhan

10:26.208 --> 10:28.299
Let's get her to medical.
Just make sure she's OK.

10:37.674 --> 10:39.140
What's your update?

10:39.274 --> 10:42.240
We get a ton of rice in a couple
of days but it's crap quality.

10:42.674 --> 10:44.368
Ugh. l really don't care.

10:44.507 --> 10:46.871
Just so long as they bring in
the water purification tablets.

10:47.007 --> 10:48.734
Ah, they're gone.

10:49.507 --> 10:52.564
Mehrzad's men had them
hijacked off the aid supply trucks.

10:53.274 --> 10:54.796
High energy biscuits too.

10:55.874 --> 10:58.806
Did you text him?
Can we set up a Skype call?

10:58.941 --> 11:01.566
It's really hard to save a
thousand of his starving people

11:01.707 --> 11:03.139
while he's stealing our supplies.

11:03.274 --> 11:05.933
l guess if you're a war lord selling
aid supplies on the black market

11:06.074 --> 11:08.505
you don't care about killing
off a few of your countrymen.

11:08.640 --> 11:11.106
Clearly. Just wish
he'd steal the crap he wants.

11:16.373 --> 11:19.464
Ladies and gentlemen,
please join with me

11:19.607 --> 11:24.539
and help welcome a true
legend of the US Space Program,

11:24.674 --> 11:26.401
Commander Don Wincroft.

11:37.941 --> 11:39.600
Did you know Wincroft was coming?

11:40.174 --> 11:40.935
Are you kidding me?

11:41.074 --> 11:42.062
On a pissed off scale of 1 to 10?

11:42.208 --> 11:43.571
Nineteen. -OK.

11:44.107 --> 11:47.402
Thank you. Thank you.
Good morning everyone.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.631
A special good morning to
you our civilian astronauts.

11:51.407 --> 11:55.067
In a few hours they will do
what most people only dream of.

11:55.208 --> 11:59.401
Break free from
the earth's grasp and fly.

12:00.241 --> 12:01.570
He sure talks pretty.

12:03.340 --> 12:07.739
You take with you all the earth's
best hopes, dreams and ambitions.

12:08.674 --> 12:10.004
God speed.

12:10.874 --> 12:14.238
Crew and passengers
of the Roebling Clipper.

12:37.473 --> 12:38.530
When l first found out that

12:38.674 --> 12:41.197
l was picked from all of
Virginia to go on this flight,

12:41.340 --> 12:43.306
ah, l was pretty shocked.

12:43.740 --> 12:47.433
Especially since l didn't know that my
wife had entered me in the lottery.

12:47.574 --> 12:50.506
But what she didn't know
is that l entered her too. Oh.

12:53.473 --> 12:56.667
OK. I'll see you later?

12:56.807 --> 12:58.534
Don't you know never
to say that to a girl?

12:58.674 --> 13:00.038
See you later sounds like a shut down.

13:00.174 --> 13:02.037
Like, I'll see you never.

13:03.041 --> 13:03.836
Ya, I'm sorry.

13:03.974 --> 13:04.803
OK, OK.

13:04.941 --> 13:06.066
I'll call you sometime.

13:08.208 --> 13:09.730
l will see you soon.

13:16.674 --> 13:17.935
Dr. Bakus.

13:18.074 --> 13:18.562
Jeff

13:18.707 --> 13:20.935
How bout a few words with
you and Commander Wincroft?

13:21.707 --> 13:23.003
I'm sorry. I'm busy.

13:28.273 --> 13:32.172
The hardest part l think is leaving
my wife in Afghanistan.

13:32.307 --> 13:33.796
We hope that my being here today

13:33.941 --> 13:38.169
will help draw attention to the needs
of the refugees that we're helping.

13:38.674 --> 13:41.504
Do you have any concerns about
last night's events in Sydney?

13:41.640 --> 13:42.469
Oh none at all.

13:42.607 --> 13:45.402
And besides, l know the
Roebling Clipper inside out.

13:45.540 --> 13:48.438
If there's any problem,
l know where to kick it to fix it.

13:48.574 --> 13:50.699
So you have no concerns even
though this launch is happening

13:50.841 --> 13:52.568
during a spike in solar activity?

13:52.707 --> 13:53.695
Oh. None what so ever.

13:53.841 --> 13:55.568
And besides, if there
was anything working wrong

13:55.707 --> 13:57.173
we'd have scrubbed the mission.

13:58.674 --> 14:02.299
How bout that son of a bitch asking
about the spike in solar activity?

14:02.440 --> 14:03.963
It's a reasonable question.

14:04.941 --> 14:06.531
What? Are you saying that we're at risk?

14:06.674 --> 14:08.299
No, I'm saying it's
a reasonable question, Peter.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.702
It's space travel. There's always risks.

14:10.841 --> 14:13.363
Craig. ls there any solid
data that we're in danger?

14:13.507 --> 14:14.473
No.

14:15.540 --> 14:17.267
OK, would you get on the flight?

14:17.941 --> 14:19.270
You know l would.

14:19.407 --> 14:21.101
Well, that's good enough for me.

14:21.240 --> 14:24.764
We've been following Mr. Roebling's
successes for some time now,

14:24.907 --> 14:28.236
and personally I'm thrilled
that Peter invited me to come.

14:28.373 --> 14:31.067
My husband and l
have absolute confidence that

14:31.207 --> 14:33.571
this will be a safe
and exciting journey.

14:34.373 --> 14:36.498
Dr. Bakus. Excuse me Dr Bakus,

14:36.640 --> 14:39.470
I'm Reg Walker, Reggie,
Reginald if you'd like. Ha.

14:39.607 --> 14:40.368
Hi Reginald.

14:40.507 --> 14:43.133
I'm a communications technician
and we met a couple of weeks ago.

14:43.273 --> 14:45.796
Dr. Bakus.
l need you to take a look at this.

14:45.941 --> 14:48.270
Anyways I'm going to be working
integrated communications today.

14:48.407 --> 14:49.430
Great.

14:49.574 --> 14:51.097
I'd just like to say Dr. Bakus,

14:51.240 --> 14:54.297
it's a real honor to be serving
with you on this mission.

14:54.440 --> 14:58.133
Thanks. You're still here.

14:58.273 --> 14:59.330
Um, well look,

14:59.473 --> 15:00.996
I'm a doctoral student at the Polytech

15:01.140 --> 15:04.039
and l was wondering if you'd consider
looking over my uh, my thesis?

15:04.173 --> 15:06.605
Reggie, it's a big day
for both of us here today.

15:06.740 --> 15:08.205
l need you to focus in. OK?

15:08.340 --> 15:09.328
Absolutely.

15:09.473 --> 15:10.632
Abso, no I'm focused.

15:10.774 --> 15:13.262
Uh, uh, no l did not, not today.

15:13.407 --> 15:17.533
Ha ha, I'm just thinking
sometime in the near future.

15:19.473 --> 15:20.302
Um, you know what,

15:20.440 --> 15:21.906
why don't you give me
your ah cell phone number?

15:22.041 --> 15:24.131
l can text you my contact info. Huh?

15:24.273 --> 15:25.603
l don't have a cell phone.

15:25.740 --> 15:27.569
That's a brilliant life choice.

15:27.707 --> 15:28.604
Ya. You know what?

15:28.740 --> 15:30.763
I'm going to give you
my cell phone number,

15:30.907 --> 15:35.202
and you can just call me
whenever you'd like. How bout that?

15:37.874 --> 15:38.965
You're not at your work station.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.629
Ya. Right. Ha. Ya.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.934
OK. Alright everybody,
let's get this party started.

15:45.074 --> 15:46.403
Com loop check time.

16:32.941 --> 16:34.804
Mom! Look, there's dad!

16:34.941 --> 16:35.838
Oh

16:41.674 --> 16:43.936
He looks cool in that space suit.

16:44.540 --> 16:45.062
Yup.

16:45.140 --> 16:47.231
She'll have to call you back later.

16:47.874 --> 16:48.362
Who was that?

16:48.507 --> 16:50.063
Ah Dr. Gallagher's office.

16:50.207 --> 16:51.468
That could have been important.

16:51.607 --> 16:53.232
Today you're not a nurse.

16:53.373 --> 16:55.339
Today you are an astronaut's wife.

16:55.473 --> 16:57.166
Besides you have to keep this line free.

16:57.307 --> 17:00.364
Relax mom. The PR company
will call. They said they will.

17:04.272 --> 17:05.829
You know things are really
going to change around here.

17:05.973 --> 17:08.701
Jose said he might even write
a book about his experiences.

17:08.840 --> 17:10.136
Write a book.

17:11.272 --> 17:12.933
He can barely write his name.

17:13.840 --> 17:14.897
Mom!

17:16.207 --> 17:17.638
Well it's true, isn't it?

17:19.507 --> 17:22.301
Yes, hello? She'll call yo back!

18:24.273 --> 18:25.432
Mind if l watch?

18:26.073 --> 18:28.403
Yes. What are you doing here anyway?

18:29.207 --> 18:32.139
NASA sent me as a personal
favor to President Methany.

18:32.273 --> 18:33.966
Serves me right for voting for him.

18:36.440 --> 18:37.599
So how you been?

18:38.307 --> 18:41.432
Really? ls this the conversation
we're going to have?

18:41.940 --> 18:43.668
What's next,
woody banter about the weather.

18:43.807 --> 18:46.272
If you'll excuse me
I've got a space ship to fly.

18:47.207 --> 18:49.696
Well done.
Almost like a real space program.

18:50.906 --> 18:52.031
Bite me.

18:52.707 --> 18:54.536
I'd be nice. The world is watching.

19:03.674 --> 19:06.469
What are you doing here anyway?
Seriously?

19:15.807 --> 19:19.136
The first ever paying tourist was
a wealthy American industrialist

19:19.273 --> 19:20.830
who flew to the international
space station...

19:20.973 --> 19:22.769
You're late. -Sorry.

19:22.906 --> 19:24.566
MSNBC needed a statement.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.201
Well l guess it
must be a pretty busy day

19:27.340 --> 19:28.965
being the President's Science adviser?

19:29.106 --> 19:30.436
Yes Mr. President.

19:31.973 --> 19:34.496
Television seems to really love
your husband there Cheryl.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.063
Which one?

19:37.440 --> 19:39.065
I'm sorry. That was awkward.

19:39.207 --> 19:42.105
It's fine Mr. President.
Craig and l divorced years ago.

19:42.240 --> 19:43.263
We're both past it.

19:44.440 --> 19:46.463
Well in that case the one on the left.

19:46.607 --> 19:48.470
In that case, thank you Mr. President.

19:51.106 --> 19:54.732
OK. This is flights.
l need a launch status check TBC.

19:54.873 --> 19:56.066
TBC is go.

19:56.207 --> 19:57.195
Fido?

19:57.340 --> 19:58.271
Go

19:58.407 --> 19:58.963
Guidance?

19:59.106 --> 19:59.800
Go

19:59.940 --> 20:00.668
lnco?

20:00.807 --> 20:02.432
lnco is go flight.

20:02.574 --> 20:03.834
Right. That's it.

20:03.973 --> 20:06.030
We are go for launch. Roebling One

20:08.906 --> 20:10.338
you have clearance for take off.

20:11.873 --> 20:12.998
Roger that flight.

20:29.640 --> 20:31.105
And sir we have lift off.

21:12.674 --> 21:15.697
Alright everybody
just like we trained for.

21:16.307 --> 21:17.671
Now once we get to 50,000 feet,

21:17.806 --> 21:19.999
that's when the show really begins.

21:21.674 --> 21:25.265
what do you think Fiona?
This beats working for the air force.

21:25.407 --> 21:26.395
Absolutely.

21:26.540 --> 21:28.597
Though l did like the
air force flight suits better.

21:28.739 --> 21:30.467
Well you know l think these suits

21:30.607 --> 21:33.198
help to fire up
the imagination of the public.

21:33.340 --> 21:34.862
Not to mention our investors.

21:35.006 --> 21:37.598
Always looking out for the bottom line.
Huh Peter?

21:40.674 --> 21:43.663
Altitude reading,
cruising up to 22,000 feet.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.830
How are you doing Mr. Hernandez?

21:50.273 --> 21:55.228
Pretty good. Except for the fact that my
heart's about to jump out of my chest.

21:56.173 --> 21:59.401
Back at the press conference
you said you weren't scared.

21:59.473 --> 22:00.530
l lied.

22:03.373 --> 22:08.703
So, uh, is this your
first time flying into space?

22:09.273 --> 22:11.704
Yes. And yours?

22:12.240 --> 22:15.831
It's my first time flying. Period.

22:17.574 --> 22:20.631
Well if you get really nervous
you can grab onto my hand.

22:21.440 --> 22:26.395
And piss off the President of the
United States. l got enough trouble.

22:28.739 --> 22:30.705
29,000 feet and climbing.

22:31.773 --> 22:35.001
Hey Alan. Why don't you
wave to the folks at home?

22:36.140 --> 22:38.935
Donate now to the Elias refugee camp.

22:39.073 --> 22:41.732
Send this man your money.
He will save refugees

22:41.873 --> 22:44.771
and he might even win himself
another humanitarian prize.

22:46.507 --> 22:47.699
How we doing Denise?

22:47.840 --> 22:48.999
A OK boss.

22:50.507 --> 22:51.733
Madam First Lady?

22:52.340 --> 22:53.805
I'm doing just great.

22:55.773 --> 22:56.864
Jose?

22:57.673 --> 23:01.799
(Spanish)

23:06.207 --> 23:07.797
How's she flying Fiona?

23:08.340 --> 23:09.771
Beautifully.

23:12.906 --> 23:15.236
Here we are aboard the Roebling Clipper.

23:15.373 --> 23:18.134
Approaching 50,000 feet.

23:27.639 --> 23:30.538
I'm sorry Mr. Miller but trading
in all exchanges has been halted.

23:31.273 --> 23:34.000
There's some kind of
electrical glitch in the system.

23:34.140 --> 23:36.368
No, I'm sure it's absolutely nothing.

23:36.507 --> 23:39.166
On camera we see Alan Elias.

23:39.307 --> 23:42.704
Mr Elias of course and his wife Joan
noted humanitarian relief efforts.

23:42.840 --> 23:45.534
Yes,yes l have those documents
here in my hand.

23:46.140 --> 23:47.696
And as soon as trading resumes

23:47.840 --> 23:49.965
l will be sure to execute
your exchange.

23:50.673 --> 23:52.264
College students has since grown

23:52.407 --> 23:55.066
into a major international
aid organization

23:55.207 --> 23:56.434
with branches in...

23:56.574 --> 23:58.971
Yes he is my father. -more than
70 countries all over the world.

23:59.106 --> 24:01.004
An you may recall a few years ago
-I'm very excited for him.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.697
the Elias' were honored
by the Nobel community

24:03.840 --> 24:06.806
and recognized with the prestigious
Simmons accommodation

24:06.940 --> 24:09.429
for their relief efforts in Afghanistan.

24:09.574 --> 24:13.665
35,000 feet. 36,000 feet.
Still climbing.

24:14.440 --> 24:15.371
Thanks.

24:16.073 --> 24:17.539
Hey listen l was out of line earlier,

24:17.673 --> 24:20.333
with that uh crack about
the real space program,

24:20.473 --> 24:22.734
uh, and uh for that. I'm sorry.

24:23.440 --> 24:24.735
l think you've mistaken me for somebody

24:24.873 --> 24:26.430
who actually cares what you think.

24:30.473 --> 24:31.597
Regardless.

24:32.940 --> 24:34.065
l guess it's a little much for me

24:34.207 --> 24:36.435
to think that we could
still be friendly, huh?

24:36.573 --> 24:38.039
Sure. Whatever.

24:43.340 --> 24:44.533
How's Cheryl?

24:45.273 --> 24:47.761
She's good. She's ah... she's good.

24:47.906 --> 24:49.304
I'll let her know you said hello.

24:49.773 --> 24:50.796
l didn't.

24:54.273 --> 24:58.069
Roebling Clipper at 48,000 feet. 49,000.

24:59.273 --> 25:01.432
Flight we are at ignition altitude.

25:02.140 --> 25:04.901
Roebling Clipper,
you ready to light it up?

25:06.006 --> 25:07.233
Roger Flight.

25:08.307 --> 25:09.204
Ignition.

25:29.073 --> 25:30.198
Yeah BABY!

25:44.240 --> 25:48.468
Roebling One to Flight.
We are in low earth orbit.

25:49.373 --> 25:52.930
Roger that Roebling One.
Welcome to space.

25:57.506 --> 25:58.370
Yes.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.063
Good job.

26:17.440 --> 26:18.632
Roger

26:21.006 --> 26:21.994
Great job.

26:23.840 --> 26:24.863
Jose.

26:30.606 --> 26:32.163
He's so cool. -Ya.

26:34.606 --> 26:38.004
Roebling One to Flight.
We are in low earth orbit.

26:38.539 --> 26:41.335
Roger that. Roebling One.
Welcome to space.

26:44.006 --> 26:45.596
To Alan Elias.

26:45.739 --> 26:49.899
The Elias Afghan Relief
Camp's first astronaut.

26:51.606 --> 26:53.004
To Alan!

26:57.906 --> 26:59.133
Alan is in space.

27:02.973 --> 27:05.064
And there you have it
ladies and gentlemen,

27:05.207 --> 27:10.367
after a near flawless launch the
Roebling Clipper has achieved orbit.

27:10.806 --> 27:13.772
And there on camera
right now we see Alan Elias.

27:13.906 --> 27:19.668
Ah Mr Elias the oldest member on board
Roebling Clipper's inaugural flight.

27:21.207 --> 27:22.968
Congratulations everybody

27:23.606 --> 27:26.936
on being the first commercial
passengers in space.

27:27.073 --> 27:30.062
Now l have a special
little gift for everyone.

27:30.207 --> 27:34.264
Astronaut bubbly.
Ah, champagne in a bag!

27:35.906 --> 27:37.428
Nicely done sir.

27:40.040 --> 27:41.233
What a view.

28:00.307 --> 28:01.295
Denise?

28:02.372 --> 28:04.429
Hey. l thought you forgot about me.

28:06.273 --> 28:08.136
Never. How's the ship?

28:08.273 --> 28:11.727
Oh please tell me you did not ask about
the ship before asking about me.

28:11.873 --> 28:13.203
l am repentant.

28:13.339 --> 28:15.498
Ya. You better be.

28:16.040 --> 28:18.733
I'm fine, thanks for asking
and so is the Roebling Clipper.

28:18.873 --> 28:19.600
Can you do me a favor?

28:19.739 --> 28:20.329
When you get back,

28:20.472 --> 28:23.404
prepare a report for me on
the fuel cells from the scalar drive.

28:24.140 --> 28:26.537
Just curious to see whether or
not the photonic distribution

28:26.673 --> 28:28.502
was affected by the change in gravity.

28:29.973 --> 28:31.563
That is a massive turn on.

28:32.506 --> 28:35.336
So, how are you doing?

28:36.806 --> 28:37.737
I'm great.

28:37.873 --> 28:39.964
This is an amazing experience actually,

28:40.106 --> 28:43.765
and, l just,
l wish l could share it with you.

28:45.773 --> 28:47.137
Listen, Denise.

28:47.439 --> 28:48.336
Ya?

28:48.472 --> 28:49.870
When you get back,

28:52.207 --> 28:55.139
l really do want that report
on photonic distribution.

28:57.140 --> 28:58.265
Bastard.

29:06.306 --> 29:07.431
Denise huh?

29:09.506 --> 29:11.563
Why don't you do me a favor,
stick to what you know.

29:19.306 --> 29:21.898
Mission Control
this is the space station.

29:22.639 --> 29:25.537
We have a visual on
the Roebling Clipper.

29:25.673 --> 29:28.105
Copy that space station.
How does she look?

29:28.240 --> 29:31.467
Spectacular.
Like the future of space travel.

29:31.606 --> 29:34.198
You've been reading our
promotional material again l see.

29:34.339 --> 29:39.170
l wish l had the money to invest.
She's good to go Dr. Bakus.

29:39.306 --> 29:40.363
Thanks Ivan.

29:41.806 --> 29:43.465
Roebling One this is Flight.

29:45.240 --> 29:47.330
You're good to go for
scalar drive ignition.

29:49.639 --> 29:50.900
Copy that Flight.

29:52.472 --> 29:55.404
Ladies and gentlemen,
next stop, the moon.

29:56.106 --> 30:00.504
Sit back and relax folks,
this is going to be something.

30:07.973 --> 30:11.496
On my mark. And mark.

30:28.706 --> 30:29.865
Wow.

30:52.073 --> 30:57.334
Pushing through 1000. 1 100,
pushing past 1300 miles per minute.

30:57.940 --> 30:58.906
Amazing.

31:19.873 --> 31:20.861
What the hell!?

31:21.006 --> 31:21.937
Oh my god!

31:24.606 --> 31:25.697
What was that?

31:27.873 --> 31:30.498
Everybody just, just stay calm alright.

31:34.106 --> 31:35.037
Craig?

31:37.639 --> 31:39.901
Can you hear me Craig?
Are you there?

31:41.606 --> 31:43.936
Talk to me. Do you have
any idea what's going on?

31:44.739 --> 31:46.432
l can't take anything up here.

31:54.139 --> 31:55.332
Talk to me Craig

31:55.639 --> 31:56.502
What's happening?

31:56.639 --> 31:57.866
l don't know.

31:58.639 --> 32:00.969
Denise. What's going on?

32:01.106 --> 32:02.037
I'm not sure.

32:02.773 --> 32:04.966
Some kind of spike in the energy,
maybe a solar anomaly.

32:05.105 --> 32:06.072
Come on!

32:06.706 --> 32:08.865
Everyone hold on tight.
We're figuring this out.

32:10.739 --> 32:11.432
Cheryl

32:11.573 --> 32:13.402
Don. What's happening?

32:14.339 --> 32:16.362
We don't know yet.
Some sort of power surge.

32:16.739 --> 32:18.967
lnco, can you pull up space station?

32:19.105 --> 32:20.037
I'm on it.

32:20.172 --> 32:21.160
Thank you.

32:24.406 --> 32:25.429
Space station is up.

32:25.573 --> 32:26.834
We need to know
whats on your sensors.

32:26.973 --> 32:28.097
Thanks lnco.

32:28.840 --> 32:31.567
It was a wave of cosmic rays.
Micro burst.

32:32.773 --> 32:34.739
From where? Solar or galactic?

32:34.873 --> 32:36.964
Local. From our sun.

32:37.105 --> 32:40.868
We're detecting a CME behind it.
Big one.

32:41.006 --> 32:42.869
Cheryl. Copy that space station.

32:43.006 --> 32:44.904
It was a blast of cosmic radiation.

32:45.040 --> 32:47.403
There's a big CME storm
following right behind it.

32:48.206 --> 32:50.365
Denise? That was a cosmic ray.

32:50.506 --> 32:52.233
Coronal mass ejection
bringing up the rear.

32:52.506 --> 32:54.165
How's everybody doing up there?

32:58.840 --> 33:00.430
Freaking the hell out. How bad is this?

33:00.573 --> 33:01.334
l don't know yet.

33:01.472 --> 33:03.267
Flight... check your monitor.

33:08.840 --> 33:10.430
She's accelerating. Hang on.

33:11.372 --> 33:13.338
Fiona. Can you confirm
the engine readings please?

33:14.072 --> 33:18.505
Ah... 47 percent, and, and rising.

33:20.573 --> 33:21.937
51 percent

33:22.072 --> 33:23.197
Shut down the mains.

33:25.439 --> 33:27.564
Negative.
Negative on an engine shut down.

33:32.206 --> 33:33.297
Oh my god.

33:34.172 --> 33:35.536
53 percent.

33:44.339 --> 33:45.202
Damn it.

33:45.873 --> 33:47.930
Hey, will you tell me
what the hell is going on?

33:48.072 --> 33:49.698
The Clipper is accelerating
right at the moon,

33:49.840 --> 33:50.965
and if you would just
stay out of our way

33:51.105 --> 33:52.901
maybe we can get
something done about it.

33:53.472 --> 33:55.631
Cheryl we got a real
situation brewing here.

33:56.472 --> 33:58.961
No I'm not so sure
he's capable to deal with it.

33:59.506 --> 34:00.597
Thank you.

34:04.439 --> 34:05.462
OK.

34:09.472 --> 34:10.529
Mr. President.

34:14.306 --> 34:15.465
How bad is it?

34:16.272 --> 34:19.067
A cosmic ray storm triggered a
malfunction in the scalar drive.

34:19.206 --> 34:20.502
The passengers are OK.

34:20.639 --> 34:23.230
Mission control is doing
everything they can to fix it.

34:23.739 --> 34:25.101
So they can fix it?

34:25.806 --> 34:27.203
We don't know yet.

34:27.639 --> 34:29.002
If you needed publicity so bad,

34:29.139 --> 34:31.833
why didn't you send
mom to a kid's hospital,

34:31.972 --> 34:33.666
instead of into space?

34:40.005 --> 34:41.869
Can you kill power to
the scalar drive remotely?

34:42.005 --> 34:43.062
We already tried that.

34:43.206 --> 34:44.672
Guidance, what's our current course?

34:44.806 --> 34:47.168
If she keeps keeps accelerating
she's gonna blow right past the moon

34:47.306 --> 34:48.533
and shoot off into space.

34:48.672 --> 34:50.002
What do we have remote access to?

34:50.139 --> 34:50.900
How about the thrusters?

34:51.039 --> 34:52.665
How about you let me handle this?

34:52.806 --> 34:55.397
How about you cut crap
and let me help you.

34:58.339 --> 35:00.271
Here, put these on.

35:01.873 --> 35:04.202
Have you tried bypassing
you're A/B Bus modules?

35:04.339 --> 35:04.737
Yes.

35:04.873 --> 35:06.532
What is our current speed?

35:06.673 --> 35:09.901
2789 miles per minute.

35:10.039 --> 35:11.437
ls that even possible?

35:11.573 --> 35:12.834
Apparently!

35:20.206 --> 35:21.263
Are any of the engines responding?

35:21.406 --> 35:21.996
No.

35:22.139 --> 35:23.002
Thrusters? -No.

35:23.139 --> 35:24.628
Retros? -l can't get anything.

35:24.773 --> 35:26.204
Come on, damn it.

35:27.172 --> 35:28.365
What are these guys still doing here?

35:28.506 --> 35:29.529
They have permission to be here.

35:29.673 --> 35:30.400
Get out of here!

35:30.539 --> 35:31.732
Not anymore they don't.

35:31.873 --> 35:32.997
Were done here gentlemen.

35:45.539 --> 35:48.004
Not anymore they don't.
Were done here gentlemen.

35:50.905 --> 35:54.133
Well as yo just saw there,
ah, it seems that ah,

35:54.272 --> 35:58.068
Commander Don Wincroft is no
longer allowing our news crew

35:58.206 --> 36:01.832
to broadcast live from inside
mission control, so...

36:01.972 --> 36:07.166
We will continue to bring you updates
as this situation unfolds, ah, meantime

36:21.606 --> 36:23.162
Fiona!? -I'm trying!

36:36.439 --> 36:38.496
Flame out. Engine just shut itself down.

36:44.239 --> 36:46.467
Denise? Are these readings correct?
The engine's off.

36:49.072 --> 36:50.038
Flamed out.

36:50.172 --> 36:51.433
Oh, thank god.

36:51.573 --> 36:53.801
What she said. Thank god.

36:55.005 --> 36:56.631
We're no longer accelerating.

36:56.773 --> 36:59.568
But we're not slowing down either.
Are we?

36:59.706 --> 37:01.296
Flight, can you confirm
our current trajectory?

37:01.439 --> 37:02.870
l can't get a read up here anymore.

37:04.739 --> 37:06.637
Working on that right now. Guidance?

37:06.773 --> 37:07.466
Give me another minute.

37:07.606 --> 37:08.469
You don't have another minute.

37:08.606 --> 37:11.935
Fido? l want you to work up
the following protocol.

37:12.905 --> 37:13.769
Go.

37:17.872 --> 37:19.361
Well as you saw just moments ago

37:19.506 --> 37:22.938
we have lost our video feed from
inside the Roebling Spaceport.

37:23.072 --> 37:25.129
But we are going to
go now live to our reporter

37:25.272 --> 37:27.670
Jeff Gustas who is standing by outside.

37:27.805 --> 37:29.431
Ah Jeff, what is the latest?

37:29.573 --> 37:31.766
All we know is that there's
been some sort of a mishap

37:31.905 --> 37:33.462
aboard the Roebling Clipper.

37:33.606 --> 37:37.060
Whether it's mechanical malfunction
or something caused by human error,

37:37.206 --> 37:39.695
we really don't have any way
of determining at the moment.

37:39.839 --> 37:40.930
Alright. Thank you very much.

37:41.072 --> 37:43.436
That of course Jeff Gustas our reporter

37:43.573 --> 37:47.198
who is tracking this developing
story for us this afternoon.

37:48.239 --> 37:49.432
This is what l got.

37:50.573 --> 37:51.038
You sure?

37:51.172 --> 37:52.365
Hundred percent.

37:56.272 --> 37:57.295
We need to call the President

37:57.439 --> 37:58.166
Ya

38:03.805 --> 38:04.771
So it's not going to hit the moon?

38:04.905 --> 38:06.394
That's correct Mr. President.

38:06.539 --> 38:07.698
The current trajectory
will bring the ship

38:07.839 --> 38:09.567
close enough to the lunar surface

38:09.706 --> 38:11.762
that the gravity will slingshot
it around the moon.

38:11.905 --> 38:13.064
And back towards earth?

38:13.206 --> 38:15.967
No Sir. The ships going so fast that

38:16.105 --> 38:19.629
it's going to veer off into
space towards the sun.

38:20.105 --> 38:24.265
Oh God. What about a rescue?

38:25.639 --> 38:28.332
I'm sorry Mr President but that's
just out of the question right now.

38:28.905 --> 38:32.167
We are presently working at
firing the thrusters remotely,

38:32.306 --> 38:34.204
Sir from Mission Control.

38:34.905 --> 38:38.099
That's true Sir,
but it's a very very long shot.

38:39.005 --> 38:40.198
Statistically close to impossible.

38:40.339 --> 38:41.770
But not actually impossible?

38:41.905 --> 38:43.303
No Sir.

38:45.239 --> 38:46.227
You don't know
what you're talking about.

38:46.372 --> 38:47.735
You bet l do.

38:47.872 --> 38:49.701
OK. Listen. Make it happen.

38:49.839 --> 38:51.771
l don't care how, just do it.

38:51.905 --> 38:54.064
Cheryl, go there.

38:54.206 --> 38:55.694
l want eyes and ears in Mission Control,

38:55.839 --> 38:57.805
l wan to know what's happening
as it happens, no matter what.

38:57.939 --> 38:59.064
l understand Mr. President.

38:59.206 --> 39:00.796
Why are you giving him false hope?

39:00.939 --> 39:03.030
I'm not quite ready to
give up on your ship yet.

39:03.172 --> 39:04.694
I'm not giving up on my ship!

39:04.839 --> 39:06.896
But I'm not blowing smoke either.

39:07.039 --> 39:08.198
You know what,
that's always been your problem.

39:08.339 --> 39:09.566
You just don't know when to quit.

39:09.705 --> 39:12.638
Well you don't know when to fight
for something worth fighting for.

39:12.772 --> 39:14.136
You never did.

39:21.206 --> 39:26.571
You know, um, she only went
because l asked her to.

39:28.172 --> 39:30.763
They're doing everything they can
to bring the First Lady home Sir.

39:32.172 --> 39:36.070
Windcroft and Bakus,
they ever let you down?

39:38.239 --> 39:39.603
Not together.

39:43.939 --> 39:46.599
Aren't there back up systems?
There are always back up systems.

39:46.738 --> 39:48.227
There are plenty of back up systems.

39:48.372 --> 39:51.031
No one could have
anticipated a problem like this.

39:54.506 --> 39:55.233
Denise?

39:55.372 --> 39:57.133
Ya, I'm here. You got some good news?

39:57.272 --> 39:58.897
We're working on some
models right now to see

39:59.039 --> 40:01.301
if we can't get those
thrusters firing remotely.

40:01.872 --> 40:02.860
Well that's never going to work.

40:03.005 --> 40:03.902
l wish it could but it won't.

40:04.039 --> 40:05.130
It might.

40:06.239 --> 40:08.467
You just keep working on
the thrusters on your end, OK?

40:08.606 --> 40:09.503
Understood.

40:09.638 --> 40:12.798
Listen, about those scalar fuel
cells numbers you asked for.

40:14.072 --> 40:16.402
l think we can put a pin
in that for now right?

40:16.539 --> 40:18.198
No, there's something odd about them.

40:18.339 --> 40:19.362
Like they're over clogged,

40:19.506 --> 40:22.097
as if they were adjusted to
perform at higher levels then

40:22.239 --> 40:23.170
when we tested them.

40:23.306 --> 40:25.135
Could that happen all on it's own?

40:25.939 --> 40:26.962
No.

40:28.472 --> 40:30.165
Ya, that's what l thought.

40:30.306 --> 40:36.466
Denise, let's just focus for now on
getting the thrusters working OK?

40:38.372 --> 40:39.429
Roger that.

40:40.139 --> 40:41.036
Bye.

40:50.339 --> 40:51.827
But there's really no point.

40:53.005 --> 40:54.198
Mom, what l was trying to say is that

40:54.339 --> 40:56.305
I'm not happy you're alone right now.

40:57.072 --> 40:58.867
Well that's never bothered you before.

41:01.406 --> 41:05.202
I'm sorry. That was mean.
I'm not alone JJ.

41:05.339 --> 41:08.305
I'm surrounded by 950 people
who need me.

41:09.772 --> 41:11.863
There's nothing either of us can
do for your dad right now.

41:12.005 --> 41:13.971
Well I'm sure the US is
doing everything they can

41:14.105 --> 41:15.469
to protect him and these people.

41:16.672 --> 41:20.002
Governments don't
save people JJ, people do.

41:20.139 --> 41:21.627
People save people.

41:23.539 --> 41:29.937
Mom. What the... Ma! Hello?

41:30.072 --> 41:31.265
JJ?

41:37.872 --> 41:38.963
JJ?

42:03.439 --> 42:06.428
Now as the Clipper slingshots around
the moon she'll be pulling 9 G's...

42:06.572 --> 42:08.266
Excuse me. ls she rated for that?

42:08.406 --> 42:09.463
Reggie

42:09.905 --> 42:11.337
OK. Ya l get it
I'm just communications.

42:11.472 --> 42:12.767
I'll shut up. Ya.

42:12.905 --> 42:14.428
No, that's a good question.

42:16.738 --> 42:17.897
Dr. Bakus.

42:19.005 --> 42:20.527
It's a dog and pony show.

42:21.406 --> 42:22.666
l thought this was a closed facility.

42:22.805 --> 42:23.498
Not anymore.

42:23.638 --> 42:25.797
I'm here under orders of the
President of the United States.

42:25.939 --> 42:28.734
Can the Roebling Clipper
withstand 9 G's of force?

42:28.872 --> 42:33.032
Yes. Barely but yes.

42:33.939 --> 42:35.371
As l was saying,

42:35.905 --> 42:39.235
9 G's will send the Clipper
to veer off it's plotted course

42:39.372 --> 42:42.270
and head on an 87 degree
trajectory towards the sun.

42:42.406 --> 42:46.633
Now we need to be ready to transmit
the thruster control signal the minute

42:46.772 --> 42:48.635
she clears the far side of the moon.

42:48.772 --> 42:51.364
Now get your calculations together,
let's get on it.

42:54.372 --> 42:55.496
Hey Don. -Hey Baby.

42:55.638 --> 42:56.535
Craig.

42:56.872 --> 42:57.838
Cheryl.

42:57.972 --> 43:00.336
I'm glad you two have put aside
the animosity to work together.

43:00.471 --> 43:01.199
It's an illusion.

43:01.339 --> 43:02.804
The odds of Don's plan
working are about...

43:02.939 --> 43:03.870
Twenty percent.

43:04.005 --> 43:05.232
Zero point zero one percent

43:05.372 --> 43:07.701
You know Craig
even if you're right,

43:07.839 --> 43:10.999
the Clipper is traveling
at 11,000 miles a minute.

43:11.139 --> 43:13.536
That puts it in the sun in six days.

43:13.672 --> 43:16.230
Guess we better hope this
plan works then. Right Superman?

43:22.372 --> 43:23.167
How is he?

43:23.306 --> 43:25.533
Well he's about the same.
A brilliant guy but a pill.

43:27.572 --> 43:31.027
Clearly he still hates me and
he's not that wild about you either.

43:31.505 --> 43:33.131
But I'm glad you're here.

43:33.272 --> 43:34.567
Me too.

43:35.805 --> 43:36.964
Let me show you around.

43:39.672 --> 43:41.467
The information I'm receiving
about the rescue plan

43:41.605 --> 43:42.696
is spotty at best.

43:42.839 --> 43:44.429
Um, my sources are telling me

43:44.572 --> 43:47.436
that it involves some kind
of a transmission of a signal

43:47.572 --> 43:50.902
from Mission Control to the Roebling
Clipper that will somehow,

43:51.039 --> 43:52.402
slow the ship down...

43:52.805 --> 43:54.634
OK. Thank you very much Jeff.

43:55.039 --> 43:55.834
How's she holding up?

43:55.972 --> 43:56.903
It's hard for her.

43:57.039 --> 43:59.527
Ah, well as Jeff was saying...
-It's hard for all of us.

43:59.672 --> 44:02.866
Look if there's anything you need,
anything you want, just call me.

44:03.471 --> 44:05.199
Claire? l just wanted to remind you

44:05.339 --> 44:06.998
about the council meeting
in 30 minutes.

44:07.139 --> 44:08.866
Let's cancel that. I'm staying here.

44:09.005 --> 44:10.402
You don't have to do that.

44:11.306 --> 44:14.567
l belong here with all of you.
We're all in this together.

44:14.705 --> 44:17.069
Isn't it a little late to
change the meeting?

44:17.206 --> 44:18.694
The nice thing about being mayor

44:18.839 --> 44:21.032
is that l get to do
whatever the hell l want.

44:21.172 --> 44:24.070
Clipper is in any type of
condition to receive a signal,

44:24.206 --> 44:26.831
when and if it is broadcast.

44:26.972 --> 44:29.699
And our experts here on
the ground are telling us

44:29.839 --> 44:33.669
that any type of rescue plan
at this point is a long shot.

44:43.572 --> 44:46.629
Once we hit lunar orbit I'll
need everyone belted in tightly.

44:46.772 --> 44:48.738
Face forward in your seats
and try to stay calm.

44:48.872 --> 44:51.134
Try to stay calm, are you serious?

44:51.272 --> 44:53.669
Would you just relax.
You are in good hands.

44:53.805 --> 44:54.896
The hands that got us into this mess?

44:55.039 --> 44:56.732
Those the hands you're talking about?

44:57.172 --> 44:58.432
Gentlemen please.

44:58.572 --> 45:01.232
We're all feeling the pressure here,
this is not going to help.

45:12.306 --> 45:13.203
Denise, how you doing?

45:13.338 --> 45:16.169
Considering we just had to rip
Roebling and Elias apart, fine.

45:16.306 --> 45:19.067
How are you doing firing
those thrusters remotely?

45:19.206 --> 45:21.433
We're working on it but
just don't wait for it OK?

45:21.572 --> 45:23.538
You just keep working on
the thrusters yourself.

45:24.239 --> 45:25.636
What if we don't slow down?

45:25.772 --> 45:27.670
Where do we end up with our trajectory?

45:28.405 --> 45:31.031
Six days and you're going
to get pulled into the sun.

45:31.805 --> 45:33.828
No Craig, you can't let that happen.

45:34.905 --> 45:36.871
We're gonna get you
out of there Denise.

45:37.005 --> 45:38.630
No you don't understand Craig.

45:38.772 --> 45:41.170
If the scalar drive hits the sun,

45:41.305 --> 45:42.862
which is already going
through an active phase,

45:43.005 --> 45:45.130
the drive will just amplify
the energy in the solar plasma

45:45.272 --> 45:47.601
and send it shooting out
into every direction.

45:49.672 --> 45:50.660
You sure about that?

45:50.805 --> 45:52.634
Positive. Unfortunately.

45:53.172 --> 45:54.432
Well l guess we're just
going to have to make sure

45:54.572 --> 45:56.095
you don't hit the sun, right?

45:57.805 --> 45:59.327
Brace yourselves everyone.

46:00.271 --> 46:01.430
l gotta go.

46:01.805 --> 46:02.896
Okay.

46:04.538 --> 46:06.401
Please don't say I'll see you later.

46:07.271 --> 46:10.601
l wasn't. But l will see you later.

46:11.371 --> 46:12.496
Count on it.

46:23.638 --> 46:25.536
Denise? lnco?

46:25.939 --> 46:26.802
Well we're not going to hear from them

46:26.939 --> 46:28.132
until they clear
the other side of the moon.

46:28.271 --> 46:29.169
How long?

46:29.305 --> 46:30.828
About five minutes.

46:41.105 --> 46:42.128
Here we go.

46:44.772 --> 46:45.760
1 G,

46:48.705 --> 46:49.898
2 G's...

47:03.271 --> 47:05.067
Right now we can only imagine

47:05.205 --> 47:07.467
what is happening on
board the Roebling Clipper

47:07.605 --> 47:10.628
as it hurtles around
the far side of the moon...

47:11.772 --> 47:14.294
We are still four minutes
away from knowing the fate

47:14.438 --> 47:17.734
of the Roebling Clipper
and the six people on board.

47:17.872 --> 47:20.531
As we reported the acceleration
of the passengers

47:20.672 --> 47:22.104
and the crew will create

47:22.238 --> 47:25.727
up to 9 G's or 9 times
their body weight.

47:25.872 --> 47:27.394
The human body...

47:37.972 --> 47:39.767
With just over three minutes left,

47:39.905 --> 47:43.997
the tension not only here but
around the world is palpable.

47:44.139 --> 47:48.195
This will likely be one of those moments
that this generation looks back on

47:48.338 --> 47:50.736
and always remembers
where they were

47:50.872 --> 47:53.565
as the earth held
it's breath waiting to hear again

47:53.705 --> 47:55.103
from the Roebling Clipper.

47:55.872 --> 47:58.303
The world awaits news
from Roebling Spaceport

47:58.438 --> 47:59.995
regarding the fate of the passengers

48:00.139 --> 48:02.866
and the crew of the Roebling Clipper.

48:03.005 --> 48:04.470
With minutes remaining..

48:04.605 --> 48:07.298
All ..one has hope.. And pray...

48:07.438 --> 48:09.666
Oh C'mon. work, dammit!

48:12.738 --> 48:15.499
It's not the radio,
it's interference from outside.

48:23.905 --> 48:24.802
Four G's.

48:26.905 --> 48:28.064
Four point five.

48:35.238 --> 48:36.431
Six.

48:37.738 --> 48:39.601
Six point five.

48:40.605 --> 48:41.662
Seven.

49:04.905 --> 49:07.064
We are of course following
the online chatter

49:07.205 --> 49:09.501
regarding this story as it unfolds

49:09.638 --> 49:11.570
How many minutes until... uh...?

49:11.705 --> 49:13.330
Less than three Mr. President.

49:13.805 --> 49:15.327
ls there anything l an get for you?

49:15.471 --> 49:16.562
Ya, my wife back, safe.

49:16.705 --> 49:17.568
And like Lady Di,

49:17.705 --> 49:21.797
the First Lady seems to create this
aura of accessibility around her.

49:21.939 --> 49:24.063
She is a devoted mother,
a beloved figure,

49:24.205 --> 49:26.501
famously generous with her time.

49:26.638 --> 49:27.865
Mrs. Mathany won the hearts...

49:28.005 --> 49:30.095
The President is barely
holding it together.

49:32.104 --> 49:33.695
Colonel, what do you think?

49:33.839 --> 49:35.498
ls this mission in good hands?

49:35.939 --> 49:37.768
What do we know about Craig Bakus?

49:38.738 --> 49:42.363
Brilliant scientist,
designed the Aurora Clipper,

49:42.505 --> 49:45.994
but apparently he's not
the easiest person to deal with.

49:46.138 --> 49:49.468
Oh, great. What about Don Wincroft?

49:50.071 --> 49:52.765
NASA, decorated astronaut.

49:53.338 --> 49:56.634
Saved the crew of the shuttle
Reliant when they had to ditch

49:56.772 --> 49:59.704
and he has mission critical experience.

50:00.705 --> 50:03.569
If it was up to me,
I'd rather see him in charge.

50:05.138 --> 50:08.229
Me too. Make the call.

50:09.138 --> 50:10.900
Shouldn't that come from the President?

50:11.438 --> 50:14.598
In this matter I'm confident
l speak for President Methany.

50:15.939 --> 50:17.336
Make the call.

50:17.471 --> 50:19.630
And the Washington social scene

50:19.772 --> 50:23.568
have combined to make her one
of the most popular First Ladies.

50:23.705 --> 50:26.227
We're just hoping she returns safely.

50:29.538 --> 50:30.595
Two minutes.

50:30.738 --> 50:33.260
This is completely wrong.

50:33.405 --> 50:36.303
l understand, but tell the President
that l advise against this.

50:38.471 --> 50:42.130
Fine. No, better if it comes from me.

50:43.572 --> 50:45.538
oh god.

50:49.004 --> 50:50.095
Craig l have to talk to you.

50:50.238 --> 50:51.568
Not now Cheryl. lnco?

50:51.705 --> 50:53.034
One minute,
forty five until radio contact.

50:53.171 --> 50:55.103
Remote firing sequences
ready to transmit?

50:55.238 --> 50:56.602
Craig please, this is important.

50:56.738 --> 50:58.363
l need to speak with you in private.

51:04.471 --> 51:06.369
C'mon Cheryl, we're all friends here.

51:06.505 --> 51:09.437
We have no secrets between us. Huh?

51:11.438 --> 51:13.734
The White House wants Don
to take over the mission.

51:13.872 --> 51:15.167
What?

51:17.038 --> 51:18.561
Don is in charge now.

51:21.371 --> 51:23.030
This is a private facility,
you can't do that.

51:23.171 --> 51:25.000
Roebling's license
with the FAA allows us.

51:25.138 --> 51:26.900
l don't care. -We are federalizing
control of the operation.

51:27.038 --> 51:29.436
Craig, I'm sorry.

51:31.138 --> 51:32.069
One minute.

51:32.205 --> 51:33.296
I'll tell you what.

51:33.438 --> 51:34.927
Why don't you two stop screwing around,

51:35.071 --> 51:37.469
we'll go back to trying to
save these people's lives okay?

51:37.605 --> 51:38.730
Thank you very much.

51:39.338 --> 51:40.361
lnco...

51:41.371 --> 51:42.098
Craig...

51:42.238 --> 51:44.898
Ah... You've been trying to take
over since you got here haven't you?

51:45.038 --> 51:45.902
You think l wanted this?

51:46.038 --> 51:47.527
Hell ya! -Everyone calm down!

51:47.672 --> 51:48.399
You don't touch me.

51:48.538 --> 51:49.868
Craig, Don had nothing to do with this.

51:50.004 --> 51:50.834
It came from the top.

51:50.971 --> 51:52.198
Like hell he didn't.

51:52.338 --> 51:53.634
Roebling One.

51:53.772 --> 51:55.601
Guys, guys,
l got her... l got her...l got her...

51:55.971 --> 51:56.733
Transmit.

51:56.872 --> 51:58.565
Escort Mr. Bakus out of Mission Control.

51:58.705 --> 52:01.899
You don't touch me.
I'll get there myself.

52:03.738 --> 52:05.033
You get what you want!

52:05.171 --> 52:07.262
You happy now Wincroft? You happy!?

52:07.872 --> 52:09.167
Keep me up to speed lnco.

52:09.305 --> 52:10.566
Ya. Right.

52:11.238 --> 52:12.261
Stay focused.

52:32.238 --> 52:33.670
ls everybody okay?

52:36.271 --> 52:37.896
I'm okay... I'm good.

52:38.038 --> 52:40.163
Ah, that was almost
as bad a s the simulator.

52:47.505 --> 52:48.562
Peter?!

52:51.205 --> 52:52.398
Peter?!

52:52.538 --> 52:53.731
No...

53:00.271 --> 53:01.328
no...

53:08.371 --> 53:09.701
Try to keep up big guy.

53:19.738 --> 53:20.998
Gonna lock that?

53:23.672 --> 53:24.103
Ahhh!

53:24.238 --> 53:24.795
That is Jeff,

53:24.938 --> 53:27.700
and of course as he was mentioning
there are many factors here

53:27.838 --> 53:29.737
that need to be taken
into consideration...

53:29.871 --> 53:33.167
Don Wincroft is America's
most celebrated astronaut.

53:33.638 --> 53:35.899
It's a smart call for the President
to remove Craig Bakus

53:36.038 --> 53:38.561
and turn the rescue mission
over to Commander Wincroft.

53:44.038 --> 53:45.936
Who the hell put Wincroft in charge?

53:48.171 --> 53:49.228
Who made that call?

53:50.171 --> 53:51.398
l did Mr. President.

53:53.804 --> 53:55.327
Without consulting me?

53:55.471 --> 53:56.767
It was the right thing to do.

53:56.904 --> 54:00.859
No! The right thing would have
been to consult your boss.

54:01.804 --> 54:03.031
The Commander in Chief.

54:03.171 --> 54:06.967
...arguably the only reason the Reliant
made it safely back to earth was

54:07.104 --> 54:09.764
because of Commander
Wincroft's heroic handling of

54:09.904 --> 54:12.802
what was a near fatal situation.

54:12.938 --> 54:14.564
l feel really bad about this.

54:15.104 --> 54:17.366
You've been feeling bad about
Craig for years Cheryl.

54:17.505 --> 54:18.163
That's what he does,

54:18.305 --> 54:20.294
he makes people who
care about him feel bad.

54:20.971 --> 54:22.960
lnco? It's ah Reggie right?

54:23.104 --> 54:24.297
Ya, yes Sir, ya.

54:24.438 --> 54:26.301
Have the Clipper's thrusters fired yet?

54:26.438 --> 54:27.835
Not that l can see, no.

54:27.971 --> 54:28.959
Can we boost the signal?

54:29.104 --> 54:31.161
l tried that already and
I'm working on it now.

54:32.804 --> 54:36.737
Hey, listen. Why don't we ah give Craig
a couple more minutes to clam down,

54:36.871 --> 54:37.837
then you pay him a visit,

54:37.971 --> 54:39.733
see if he wants to come back
and be part of the team.

54:39.871 --> 54:42.133
I'm the last person he wants
to talk to right now.

54:42.271 --> 54:43.827
You might be the second last.

54:45.771 --> 54:47.203
Commander the Clipper's on line.

54:51.071 --> 54:53.128
Roebling One this is Mission Control.

54:53.271 --> 54:54.532
Dr. Bakus?

54:55.138 --> 54:57.434
This is ah Commander Don Wincroft.

54:57.505 --> 54:59.732
I've been asked to assume
control of the mission.

55:00.405 --> 55:01.893
This is Captain Henslaw correct?

55:02.038 --> 55:02.595
Yes.

55:02.737 --> 55:04.169
Captain, what's your situation up there?

55:04.305 --> 55:05.498
Have your thrusters fired yet?

55:05.638 --> 55:06.762
Negative, not yet.

55:06.904 --> 55:08.200
Commander, Peter Roebling's dead.

55:08.338 --> 55:09.599
Say again Captain.

55:10.071 --> 55:12.367
Roebling's dead. G forces were too much.

55:14.838 --> 55:15.963
Copy that.

55:17.638 --> 55:20.365
Captain, you flew with VFA-1 1 ,
the "Red Rippers" right?

55:20.505 --> 55:21.493
That's right.

55:22.104 --> 55:23.831
Remember how
they were on the Forrestal

55:23.971 --> 55:26.233
when they came through
that fire back in '67?

55:26.871 --> 55:27.768
l do.

55:27.904 --> 55:29.961
Just like that Captain, you're
going to come through this.

55:30.104 --> 55:32.297
Copy that. Denise, listen.

55:32.438 --> 55:34.869
Dr. Bakus isn't in charge any more,
Wincroft is.

55:35.004 --> 55:35.833
What? Why?

55:35.971 --> 55:37.335
l don't know. It doesn't matter.

55:37.471 --> 55:38.494
It matters to me.

55:38.638 --> 55:40.194
Listen, we've got to
get our thrusters firing.

55:40.338 --> 55:41.860
Remember you said you
knew where to kick the Clipper

55:42.004 --> 55:42.901
if something didn't work?

55:43.038 --> 55:44.527
Did you mean that
or was that just talk?

55:44.672 --> 55:45.638
l meant it.

55:45.771 --> 55:46.930
Then show me.

56:16.405 --> 56:17.665
c'mon, c'mon, c'mon...

56:21.505 --> 56:22.061
Hello?

56:22.205 --> 56:23.603
Reggie, don't say anything.

56:23.737 --> 56:25.726
Don't react, it's me Craig.

56:25.871 --> 56:28.201
l need you to do exactly what l say.

56:30.138 --> 56:31.126
Okay.

56:31.271 --> 56:33.533
l need you to patch me through
to Denise on the Roebling Clipper.

56:33.671 --> 56:34.864
Can you do that for me?

56:36.538 --> 56:38.163
Ya, l could get fired.

56:38.305 --> 56:40.827
Reggie, you don't have a job
to get fired from anymore.

56:40.971 --> 56:42.800
Do you really think that any
one's going to want to pay to fly

56:42.938 --> 56:44.733
into space after today?

56:45.171 --> 56:46.330
Ah, l see your point.

56:46.471 --> 56:50.062
Ya. Thank you.

56:50.205 --> 56:51.296
Ya.

57:12.671 --> 57:15.160
Nice work Reggie. Denise you there?

57:15.305 --> 57:18.567
Craig, where are you?
Why is Wincroft in charge?

57:19.538 --> 57:21.527
Screw that. How are you doing?

57:22.205 --> 57:23.898
Hanging in there. Barely.

57:24.038 --> 57:25.402
How bout the thrusters?

57:25.938 --> 57:27.461
Has the remote
protocol worked yet?

57:27.604 --> 57:29.968
No. They're rerouting
the system manually.

57:30.104 --> 57:31.694
Might be able to get
them started up yet.

57:31.838 --> 57:33.804
Those cosmic rays
that fired our Clipper,

57:33.938 --> 57:35.529
triggered a whole bunch of SEL.

57:35.671 --> 57:36.602
You're kidding me.

57:36.737 --> 57:38.226
A single event latch-ups? l mean c'mon.

57:38.371 --> 57:40.962
That's incredibly rare. Are you sure?

57:41.505 --> 57:42.731
That's why I'm telling you.

57:43.205 --> 57:46.501
The scalar drive was engaged
when the SELs were triggered right?

57:46.637 --> 57:47.501
Right.

57:48.671 --> 57:49.830
Don't go anywhere.

57:50.571 --> 57:51.559
l wish.

58:12.971 --> 58:16.630
Well so far it appears that the
Roebling Clipper is not responding.

58:16.771 --> 58:17.566
l repeat not responding...

58:17.704 --> 58:18.931
C'mon Cheryl, give me something.

58:19.071 --> 58:21.435
The President's watching
the news channels...

58:21.571 --> 58:24.504
We're still transmitting the
remote sequence but...

58:26.771 --> 58:29.499
the longer it fails to work the
less likely it is that is will work.

58:29.637 --> 58:31.830
Well l hope that
someone does more than try.

58:32.604 --> 58:34.298
Roger, how are you holding up?

58:35.138 --> 58:37.001
How do you think I'm holding up?

58:37.571 --> 58:39.162
Call me when you know more.

58:39.305 --> 58:42.566
hard information all we
can do at this point is guess...

58:44.438 --> 58:46.370
l think it's time
we bring Craig back in here.

58:52.604 --> 58:54.002
What is he doing?

59:01.238 --> 59:03.829
Joan. You better come.

59:06.904 --> 59:08.063
This better be good.

59:17.504 --> 59:18.527
What's going on?

59:18.671 --> 59:20.399
He says that a girl is
hiding here in the camp.

59:20.537 --> 59:23.060
Her name is Nourhan.

59:23.871 --> 59:25.700
He wants to come in and look for her.

59:26.171 --> 59:27.693
She's supposed to marry him.

59:27.838 --> 59:29.168
Marry him? She's a kid.

59:29.305 --> 59:30.895
Stay out of this please.

59:34.671 --> 59:38.126
This camp is under the
protection of International Treaties.

59:38.838 --> 59:39.496
Tell him.

59:46.104 --> 59:47.535
He's not a big fan of treaties.

59:48.004 --> 59:49.526
I'm not a big fan of his timing.

59:49.671 --> 59:54.161
Ah, does he have a picture of the girl?

59:54.305 --> 59:55.600
Do you have a picture?

01:00:08.504 --> 01:00:10.403
She's not here. Tell him.

01:00:21.437 --> 01:00:24.097
He says that the girl
is Mehrzad's daughter.

01:00:25.104 --> 01:00:28.934
Mehrzad himself sent him to find her.

01:00:29.071 --> 01:00:30.400
No.

01:00:33.504 --> 01:00:35.402
You're not coming into this camp.

01:01:05.604 --> 01:01:07.502
That was really stupid of me, wasn't it?

01:01:08.671 --> 01:01:09.898
Yes.

01:01:11.771 --> 01:01:12.169
Oh...

01:01:12.305 --> 01:01:14.429
I'm sorry... l gave her away.

01:01:14.571 --> 01:01:17.560
Ah, find Nourhan, ah...
keep her out of sight.

01:01:20.004 --> 01:01:22.061
If the Roebling Clipper's
thrusters don't fire,

01:01:22.205 --> 01:01:25.728
gravity will eventually pull
the ship directly into the sun.

01:01:25.871 --> 01:01:28.530
They really only have
one chance at this.

01:01:28.671 --> 01:01:29.898
And the real problem here is

01:01:30.038 --> 01:01:31.628
no one fully knows what will happen

01:01:31.771 --> 01:01:35.033
to the ship's scalar drive
if it impacts the sun.

01:01:43.604 --> 01:01:44.627
Craig.

01:01:47.271 --> 01:01:49.532
Why are you calculating
phased systems?

01:01:49.671 --> 01:01:51.694
If l explained to you
l won't have time to finish.

01:01:52.704 --> 01:01:54.431
So please just stop talking.

01:02:04.171 --> 01:02:04.829
Denise?

01:02:04.971 --> 01:02:05.937
Hold on.

01:02:09.637 --> 01:02:11.035
Wait, l think we're getting something.

01:02:13.504 --> 01:02:14.800
Try the thrusters.

01:02:18.038 --> 01:02:18.901
No.

01:02:19.038 --> 01:02:20.004
Try again.

01:02:24.004 --> 01:02:26.197
Craig l need you to explain this to me.

01:02:26.337 --> 01:02:27.803
Denise? Can you still hear me?

01:02:27.938 --> 01:02:28.528
Go Craig.

01:02:28.671 --> 01:02:29.898
You're talking to Denise?

01:02:30.038 --> 01:02:30.935
Dr. Bakus?

01:02:31.071 --> 01:02:32.468
l need you to confirm some
power cell settings for me.

01:02:32.604 --> 01:02:33.797
l need you to hang up right now.

01:02:33.938 --> 01:02:35.927
Forty seven, two,
ninety nine, six, thirteen...

01:02:36.071 --> 01:02:38.468
Craig you've got to let me in.
what is going on?

01:02:39.604 --> 01:02:43.434
And forty seven, two,
ninety nine, six and thirteen.

01:02:43.571 --> 01:02:44.366
Those are correct.

01:02:44.504 --> 01:02:45.697
Denise, do not...

01:02:52.537 --> 01:02:54.833
Denise copy...
Do not fire the thrusters.

01:02:54.971 --> 01:02:55.994
What?

01:02:56.737 --> 01:02:59.067
You want me to let you in,
get me out of here,

01:02:59.205 --> 01:03:00.363
we cannot fire that remote transmission.

01:03:00.504 --> 01:03:01.595
What! Why?

01:03:01.737 --> 01:03:03.464
They can't fire those thrusters.

01:03:06.637 --> 01:03:07.660
Why?

01:03:07.804 --> 01:03:08.895
Trust me.

01:03:11.804 --> 01:03:12.827
Craig!

01:03:17.038 --> 01:03:18.129
Yes.

01:03:21.138 --> 01:03:23.797
Oh Balaban,
it look like you aren't just talk.

01:03:33.370 --> 01:03:35.598
Don! Don!

01:03:35.737 --> 01:03:37.259
Tell Fiona not to fire the thrusters.

01:03:37.404 --> 01:03:38.166
Tell her now!

01:03:38.304 --> 01:03:39.032
Why?

01:03:39.171 --> 01:03:40.568
Easy, easy..

01:03:41.938 --> 01:03:43.631
Because the cosmic ray that hit the ship

01:03:43.771 --> 01:03:45.634
caused a bunch of
single event latch-ups.

01:03:45.771 --> 01:03:46.737
That means the electronics,

01:03:46.871 --> 01:03:50.359
they're stuck in the exact same state
that they were in when the ray hit.

01:03:50.504 --> 01:03:53.402
Reggie, what was the last
confirmed settings of the drive?

01:03:53.938 --> 01:03:55.460
One hundred and ninety
eight percent full forward.

01:03:55.604 --> 01:03:57.365
Full forward one hundred
and ninety eight percent.

01:03:57.504 --> 01:04:00.197
That's the state the drive's going to
be in when it comes back on line.

01:04:01.404 --> 01:04:03.030
Stand by everyone.

01:04:03.171 --> 01:04:06.500
Firing reverse thrusters.
Five percent power.

01:04:06.637 --> 01:04:08.967
Let's slow this bitch down and go home.

01:04:15.304 --> 01:04:19.498
Roebling One this is Mission Control.
Do not fire the thrusters.

01:04:19.637 --> 01:04:20.967
do not...

01:04:23.437 --> 01:04:26.335
Scalar drive engaged
instead of thrusters!

01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:28.668
Shut it down!

01:04:31.771 --> 01:04:33.930
l can't! l can't!

01:04:44.104 --> 01:04:46.433
Don? Don?

01:04:48.237 --> 01:04:49.135
Roebling One, come in, come in!

01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:49.827
lnco get em back!

01:04:49.971 --> 01:04:50.766
I'm, eh, the channels are all blocked.

01:04:50.904 --> 01:04:51.528
Well try harder!

01:04:51.671 --> 01:04:54.796
Roebling One, please come in. Come in.

01:05:02.304 --> 01:05:03.361
Oh God.

01:05:06.971 --> 01:05:09.869
Fiona! Shut them down!

01:05:10.004 --> 01:05:13.663
Engines are not responding,
Navigation seems frozen.

01:05:22.537 --> 01:05:25.526
Too repeat, reports are now
coming in that the Roebling Clipper

01:05:25.671 --> 01:05:27.796
is out of control once again.

01:05:27.938 --> 01:05:28.869
l repeat the Roebling Clipper, out of...

01:05:29.004 --> 01:05:32.629
Ma, are you there? Ma, can you hear me?

01:05:34.237 --> 01:05:39.465
Ya. I'm here sweetheart. I'm here.

01:05:39.604 --> 01:05:42.570
Good to hear your voice.
How are you over there?

01:05:43.571 --> 01:05:44.093
Listen Ivan,

01:05:44.237 --> 01:05:47.601
if you're still tracking the Clipper can
you relay her course of speed to us?

01:05:47.737 --> 01:05:51.294
Yes. We still have her but
I'm not sure for how much longer.

01:05:51.437 --> 01:05:53.460
We're sending telemetry to you now.

01:05:54.038 --> 01:05:56.902
Roebling One respond.
Roebling One respond.

01:05:57.038 --> 01:05:59.094
Denise? Fiona?

01:05:59.571 --> 01:06:01.161
Cheryl, what the hell happened?

01:06:01.304 --> 01:06:04.032
The scalar drive fired
instead of the thrusters.

01:06:04.437 --> 01:06:05.664
We didn't anticipate it.

01:06:05.804 --> 01:06:07.565
And what's being done to fix this?

01:06:08.103 --> 01:06:09.126
Fiona?

01:06:09.537 --> 01:06:11.230
Everyone is doing everything they can.

01:06:11.370 --> 01:06:13.131
The minute we know
more I'll let you know.

01:06:18.671 --> 01:06:19.967
l love you baby.

01:06:20.504 --> 01:06:25.334
Everybody, out. Out!

01:06:27.103 --> 01:06:28.433
Thank you, thank you.

01:06:33.337 --> 01:06:35.599
What's going on? Are we slowing down?

01:06:39.971 --> 01:06:42.994
No. No we've hit our top speed.

01:06:43.137 --> 01:06:44.398
That's a good thing right?

01:06:44.537 --> 01:06:48.196
l mean, if we can't go any faster,
that's good right?

01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:50.263
How fast are we going?

01:06:50.404 --> 01:06:53.097
Five thousand, five hundred
and eighty-eight miles per second.

01:06:53.237 --> 01:06:54.430
Per second?

01:06:54.838 --> 01:06:55.997
But you can turn us around right,

01:06:56.137 --> 01:06:58.569
l mean you can shut the engines down!

01:07:01.671 --> 01:07:03.159
Ah, I'm sorry.

01:07:03.871 --> 01:07:05.700
What do you mean"sorry".

01:07:06.103 --> 01:07:08.626
What does that mean?

01:07:16.204 --> 01:07:18.568
We've almost re-established
contact with the Clipper.

01:07:18.704 --> 01:07:21.135
Clipper's accelerated at three
percent the speed of light.

01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:23.702
At that speed,
it will be close enough to the sun

01:07:23.838 --> 01:07:25.599
to burn up in less than thirty minutes.

01:07:25.737 --> 01:07:27.202
That's not even the worst of it.

01:07:28.437 --> 01:07:31.335
The scalar drive is designed to
withstand intense heat,

01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:32.493
so when the Clipper incinerates,

01:07:32.637 --> 01:07:34.830
it's going to continue
on straight into the sun.

01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:36.493
The scalar drive is a quantum device.

01:07:36.637 --> 01:07:38.125
After impact it'll phase double

01:07:38.270 --> 01:07:40.862
and multiply every solar anomaly
we've been seeing.

01:07:41.337 --> 01:07:43.462
You sure know a whole hell of
a lot about scalar mechanics

01:07:43.604 --> 01:07:44.331
for an astronaut.

01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:45.936
ls there anything we can do?

01:07:46.070 --> 01:07:47.468
No. It's inevitable.

01:07:47.604 --> 01:07:48.661
There's got to be something we can do.

01:07:48.804 --> 01:07:52.668
No! It's over Don. Alright everybody!

01:07:52.804 --> 01:07:54.633
This is officially over.

01:07:56.370 --> 01:07:58.359
There's not going to be another
Shuttle Reliant for you Don.

01:07:58.871 --> 01:08:01.428
Alright, what exactly is gonna happen?

01:08:01.571 --> 01:08:03.764
The earth is gonna suffer through
a cocktail of solar events

01:08:03.904 --> 01:08:06.927
like we've never felt before.
Starting with a cosmic ray burst.

01:08:07.070 --> 01:08:09.127
Will it impact earth directly?

01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:11.668
It doesn't really make a difference
if it impacts directly.

01:08:11.804 --> 01:08:13.770
Even an indirect hit,
it's very bad news,

01:08:13.904 --> 01:08:15.460
it's gonna take out
a chunk of the ozone layer,

01:08:15.604 --> 01:08:17.296
expose us to direct solar radiation.

01:08:17.437 --> 01:08:21.062
Following right on the heels of that,
will be a massive CME.

01:08:22.103 --> 01:08:23.330
It's going to take out
all the electronics,

01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:25.402
everything the cosmic
ray hasn't touched.

01:08:25.537 --> 01:08:30.969
Throw one in for good measure,
constant static electrical storms.

01:08:31.504 --> 01:08:33.560
It's going to blast us
back into prehistory.

01:08:34.337 --> 01:08:35.529
l have to alert the the White House.

01:08:35.671 --> 01:08:37.636
They need to get the word
out to other governments.

01:08:38.237 --> 01:08:42.135
lnco? Can you patch everyone in
the Clipper through to people

01:08:42.270 --> 01:08:44.133
they need to say goodbye to please?

01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:45.524
Yes Sir.

01:08:49.002 --> 01:08:50.332
They've got 30 minutes left.

01:09:00.837 --> 01:09:02.497
I'll have a Skype for you in a minute.

01:09:03.270 --> 01:09:04.736
I'll take the audio feed.

01:09:06.571 --> 01:09:07.798
We're almost ready.

01:09:07.937 --> 01:09:09.163
Thank you Reggie.

01:09:10.103 --> 01:09:12.001
Commander, if you don't mind me asking,

01:09:12.504 --> 01:09:15.732
what was it like on Reliant
when the accident happened?

01:09:16.770 --> 01:09:17.962
Wasn't good.

01:09:18.103 --> 01:09:21.399
Dr. Bakus told me
that you lead a mutiny.

01:09:22.203 --> 01:09:23.295
Really?

01:09:23.437 --> 01:09:24.368
Ya.

01:09:24.504 --> 01:09:25.231
Well you know Reggie,

01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:29.961
Dr. Bakus often has
a slightly skewed, ah, vision.

01:09:30.703 --> 01:09:33.568
Sometimes for the better,
and sometimes not.

01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:39.732
Anyway, the ship was
severely compromised.

01:09:39.870 --> 01:09:42.200
The impact had knocked out
our guidance control board,

01:09:42.337 --> 01:09:44.428
which put us into a deteriorating orbit.

01:09:45.136 --> 01:09:48.035
Our trajectory was gonna put
us straight into Chicago.

01:09:48.170 --> 01:09:51.796
We were ordered to fire the
engines and shoot off into space.

01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:53.201
We said our goodbyes,

01:09:53.337 --> 01:09:58.634
the captain was about to engage
the engine when it occurred to me

01:09:58.771 --> 01:10:00.168
we had a rover in a cargo bay,

01:10:00.304 --> 01:10:01.963
now l don't know why no
one had thought of it before,

01:10:02.103 --> 01:10:04.763
but it had a compatible
control board on it.

01:10:04.903 --> 01:10:07.495
Now l surmised that
we could reprogram that,

01:10:07.637 --> 01:10:10.000
use it to bypass our down system.

01:10:10.737 --> 01:10:12.464
The captain refused
to take the chance.

01:10:13.537 --> 01:10:14.968
So what'd you do?

01:10:15.103 --> 01:10:16.000
Well the flight engineer

01:10:16.137 --> 01:10:18.035
and the payload officer
were keen on my plan

01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:20.500
and they backed me to
take charge of the ship.

01:10:21.204 --> 01:10:23.432
Well, the short of it is, it took ah,

01:10:23.571 --> 01:10:26.662
under three hours to reroute the system.

01:10:27.537 --> 01:10:29.298
So that's how you saved Reliant?

01:10:29.437 --> 01:10:30.733
Basically.

01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:33.735
What about this captain?
He didn't press any charges?

01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:35.802
No, you know Reggie, he never did.

01:10:36.704 --> 01:10:39.693
l guess the captain saw the merit in
NASA not finding out that ah,

01:10:39.837 --> 01:10:43.497
he was tied to his chair in what could
possibly be the greatest space rescue

01:10:43.637 --> 01:10:45.296
since Apollo 13.

01:10:50.604 --> 01:10:52.763
Commander, we're ready.
Everyone's in place.

01:10:53.671 --> 01:10:56.432
You know l really thought we were
going to beat this thing today.

01:10:59.304 --> 01:11:00.463
Me too Sir.

01:11:03.870 --> 01:11:05.496
Dad? Dad can you hear me?

01:11:05.803 --> 01:11:08.326
l, l hear you JJ.

01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:09.367
l tried to get mom on the line

01:11:09.504 --> 01:11:11.595
but there was just simply
too much interference.

01:11:11.737 --> 01:11:16.260
Um, l wanted to tell you
that I'm sorry that l,

01:11:16.404 --> 01:11:18.336
that l didn't call
you before the launch.

01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:20.992
It's okay. We're talking now.

01:11:21.903 --> 01:11:26.734
Listen, l just want to say
that I'm sorry your mom

01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:29.734
and l didn't give you the kind of
childhood you probably wanted.

01:11:31.204 --> 01:11:32.794
Don't be sorry Dad, it's not the...

01:11:32.937 --> 01:11:35.199
No, no, no l know
how you felt growing up.

01:11:35.337 --> 01:11:38.303
That we picked our work over you.

01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:47.634
But l want you to know that if l,
if l had it to do all over again

01:11:49.970 --> 01:11:51.596
I'd do the same thing.

01:11:53.470 --> 01:11:55.163
Probably not what you want to hear

01:11:57.470 --> 01:12:00.902
but l need you to understand.

01:12:02.537 --> 01:12:04.798
I've devoted my whole life to an idea.

01:12:05.770 --> 01:12:13.499
To the belief that helping others is
the greatest good a person can do.

01:12:16.370 --> 01:12:22.462
If you remember anything about me,
remember that.

01:12:24.937 --> 01:12:26.460
Ya, l won't forget that.

01:12:28.637 --> 01:12:32.160
l love you JJ. l truly do.

01:12:32.671 --> 01:12:33.727
Ya.

01:12:34.437 --> 01:12:37.631
Tell your mother that l love her.

01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:39.134
Okay then...

01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:39.997
l gotta go.

01:12:40.137 --> 01:12:41.160
Uh huh.

01:12:45.003 --> 01:12:48.299
Honey, Honey don't be sad.

01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:51.495
We'll be together again one day.

01:12:51.637 --> 01:12:53.659
l want to be with you now.

01:12:54.703 --> 01:12:58.136
l need you to be strong. Both of you.

01:12:58.270 --> 01:12:59.497
You hear that Freddie?

01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:02.893
l need you to take
care of Mommy for me.

01:13:03.037 --> 01:13:04.298
Okay Buddy?

01:13:05.070 --> 01:13:06.127
Okay.

01:13:07.037 --> 01:13:08.333
Don't be scared.

01:13:08.903 --> 01:13:15.961
I'm not. What do l always tell you?
Life's one big...

01:13:17.204 --> 01:13:18.534
Adventure.

01:13:19.803 --> 01:13:25.702
Marta, listen.
l want you to get married again.

01:13:25.837 --> 01:13:29.531
No, don't say that. Please.

01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:33.693
Yes. When the time is right,
you get married.

01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:36.835
But listen, this is important.

01:13:37.670 --> 01:13:40.102
Don't marry Brad Bartels.

01:13:40.237 --> 01:13:43.896
l see the way that sheriff looks at
you and l don't like it one bit.

01:13:46.571 --> 01:13:47.968
Okay.

01:13:48.837 --> 01:13:53.497
l just know you're gonna raise Freddie
in a way to make me proud.

01:13:56.337 --> 01:13:58.928
l gotta go. Others are waiting.

01:13:59.537 --> 01:14:01.627
Hold on Mom wants
to say something to you.

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:04.736
Jose, l just want you to know that

01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:08.666
I'm sorry for giving you such
a hard time over the years.

01:14:08.803 --> 01:14:13.566
No you're not.
But l love you anyway Mom.

01:14:23.970 --> 01:14:27.164
Denise? You shouldn't be
wasting this call on me, okay?

01:14:32.537 --> 01:14:36.992
Everyone I'm close to knows how
l feel about them except you so...

01:14:37.570 --> 01:14:38.366
Reggie boost the signal.

01:14:38.504 --> 01:14:39.867
I'm, I'm trying.

01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:42.865
I've got one question for you Craig

01:14:43.003 --> 01:14:48.833
and l know you're incapable of lying so,
here goes...

01:14:50.137 --> 01:14:55.092
Do you love me?
Because l sure as hell love you.

01:14:58.636 --> 01:15:00.000
ah...

01:15:04.137 --> 01:15:08.365
It's okay. Thank you for,
for telling me the truth.

01:15:16.404 --> 01:15:17.392
I've got to go.

01:15:17.536 --> 01:15:18.524
Ya.

01:15:18.670 --> 01:15:19.966
I'll call you later.

01:15:31.703 --> 01:15:34.295
Would it have killed you
to tell her you love her?

01:15:35.536 --> 01:15:37.162
She would have known l was lying.

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:42.093
l couldn't do that to her.

01:15:45.536 --> 01:15:47.093
I'll see ya later.

01:15:53.237 --> 01:15:55.032
We have a connection to the First Lady.

01:15:57.770 --> 01:15:59.998
You should talk to your mom first. Okay.

01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:10.331
Mom.

01:16:11.770 --> 01:16:12.861
Hey Baby.

01:16:13.903 --> 01:16:20.734
Oh Sweetie, it's okay, I'm okay.
I'm not scared.

01:16:21.536 --> 01:16:24.230
l was so awful to you before you left.

01:16:24.970 --> 01:16:29.232
Oh Baby don't...
l know you didn't mean it.

01:16:30.170 --> 01:16:32.193
Please tell me you forgive me.

01:16:33.103 --> 01:16:38.161
Of course l forgive you.
Can you do something for me?

01:16:38.603 --> 01:16:40.126
Okay, anything.

01:16:40.770 --> 01:16:43.998
Help your dad.
He's not as tough as we are.

01:16:45.436 --> 01:16:46.334
Will you do that?

01:16:46.469 --> 01:16:47.730
Okay.

01:16:51.636 --> 01:16:53.693
It wasn't anyone's fault Sweetie.

01:16:53.837 --> 01:16:55.462
You remember that, okay?

01:16:56.370 --> 01:16:58.029
Oh l love you sweet girl.

01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:02.997
l love you too, Mom.

01:17:13.237 --> 01:17:14.395
Honey l...

01:17:15.204 --> 01:17:17.227
l know... l know

01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:23.695
Look after Lara for me.
Love her just the way she is.

01:17:24.670 --> 01:17:29.693
l will...l should have held you more.

01:17:30.703 --> 01:17:32.498
So hold me now.

01:18:17.436 --> 01:18:18.697
How long till impact?

01:18:21.970 --> 01:18:24.232
Four minutes. Maybe five.

01:18:27.070 --> 01:18:28.127
It takes another eight minutes

01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:30.326
for whatever the hell's
unleashed to get here to earth.

01:18:32.903 --> 01:18:34.334
We should tell the President.

01:18:39.870 --> 01:18:40.858
Sorry.

01:18:41.003 --> 01:18:42.162
Don't.

01:18:53.137 --> 01:18:53.932
Mr. President?

01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:55.899
You heard what Cheryl said.

01:18:56.403 --> 01:19:00.859
We have to get the word out.
Mobilize the National Guard.

01:19:01.003 --> 01:19:03.901
Look, Roger. l need a moment.

01:19:11.070 --> 01:19:14.900
Mr. President, l need you to sign this.

01:19:16.770 --> 01:19:17.861
What is this?

01:19:19.536 --> 01:19:21.365
Because of your personal loss,

01:19:22.369 --> 01:19:24.801
as per the rules of
Presidential succession,

01:19:24.937 --> 01:19:27.300
you need to affirm in writing that

01:19:27.436 --> 01:19:31.698
you are no longer able to discharge
the powers and duties of your office.

01:19:33.303 --> 01:19:38.292
l just lost my wife.
l think l can have a moment.

01:19:38.970 --> 01:19:41.367
Nobody will think less
of you for doing this.

01:19:41.503 --> 01:19:46.061
It's obviously not true.
How much time do we have?

01:19:46.970 --> 01:19:48.526
Approximately eleven minutes.

01:19:48.670 --> 01:19:51.034
l want emergency messages
sent to every state

01:19:51.170 --> 01:19:53.068
and federal agency we can reach.

01:19:54.269 --> 01:19:55.758
Let 'em know what's coming.

01:19:55.903 --> 01:19:57.266
Yes, Mr. President.

01:20:00.636 --> 01:20:02.431
Get out of my sight.

01:20:11.636 --> 01:20:14.194
Yes, l understand. Thank you Governor.

01:20:16.236 --> 01:20:20.169
Jeffery? How many copies of the town of
Eden disaster plan do we have available?

01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:25.324
Make another ten copies please,
right away. Right away.

01:20:38.436 --> 01:20:39.663
One minute till impact.

01:20:40.703 --> 01:20:43.101
We won't know about the solar event

01:20:43.236 --> 01:20:45.862
or how bad it is until eight
minutes after impact.

01:20:46.003 --> 01:20:48.230
Alright l want all systems that
aren't crucial powered down

01:20:48.369 --> 01:20:49.835
and disconnected from the grid.

01:20:50.837 --> 01:20:53.997
Ivan, how long will it take you to
do an emergency evacuation?

01:20:54.137 --> 01:20:57.899
Not in eight minutes,
if that's what you mean.

01:20:58.037 --> 01:20:58.593
Besides,

01:20:58.736 --> 01:21:02.668
why would l want to give up the
best seat in the house for the show?

01:21:02.803 --> 01:21:03.894
ls that the right expression?

01:21:04.037 --> 01:21:05.434
Yes, it's the right expression.

01:21:06.703 --> 01:21:08.328
l don't think you want this seat Buddy.

01:21:08.469 --> 01:21:12.834
l will stay here and relay information
from the Solar Dynamics Observatory.

01:21:12.970 --> 01:21:15.595
Might give you
a few extra seconds of warning.

01:21:16.670 --> 01:21:17.761
Thanks Ivan.

01:21:20.469 --> 01:21:25.197
Five seconds.
Four, three, two, one. Impact.

01:21:35.436 --> 01:21:36.868
ls there a bunker here?

01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:41.297
No. Not that it makes
much of a difference.

01:21:41.436 --> 01:21:42.902
Wouldn't do us any good anyway.

01:21:50.103 --> 01:21:52.330
The world is in mourning
at the loss of the First Lady

01:21:52.469 --> 01:21:55.230
and the rest of the passengers
of the Roebling Clipper.

01:21:55.369 --> 01:21:57.426
No one is exactly sure what happened.

01:21:57.570 --> 01:21:58.729
But it is...

01:22:37.037 --> 01:22:38.297
Paul!

01:22:50.603 --> 01:22:53.626
Mom? Sa.. Sarah?

01:22:55.770 --> 01:22:58.565
No, no it's okay l don't want
you to come over right now.

01:22:59.203 --> 01:23:02.601
No, I'll be fine.
Look, l just want to be alone.

01:23:03.236 --> 01:23:05.429
I'll call you a little later okay? Okay.

01:23:07.670 --> 01:23:12.796
Freddie!? Freddie come here.
Have you seen him?

01:23:12.937 --> 01:23:14.163
l thought he was here with you.

01:23:14.303 --> 01:23:15.326
He's not in his room? -No.

01:23:15.469 --> 01:23:16.366
Freddie?

01:24:24.236 --> 01:24:25.224
Twelve,

01:24:25.969 --> 01:24:27.026
eleven,

01:24:27.603 --> 01:24:28.569
ten,

01:24:29.736 --> 01:24:30.702
nine,

01:24:31.703 --> 01:24:32.634
eight,

01:24:33.670 --> 01:24:34.727
seven,

01:24:35.503 --> 01:24:36.491
six,

01:24:37.269 --> 01:24:38.292
five,

01:24:39.036 --> 01:24:40.059
four,

01:24:40.536 --> 01:24:41.661
three,

01:24:41.803 --> 01:24:43.132
two,

01:24:43.269 --> 01:24:44.599
one.

01:25:11.236 --> 01:25:12.361
It missed us.

01:25:12.503 --> 01:25:15.957
It went lateral to earth
at eighty-two degrees.

01:25:16.102 --> 01:25:17.261
Eighty-two degrees.

01:25:19.603 --> 01:25:21.125
Dodged a bullet there huh?

01:25:24.536 --> 01:25:25.661
Wait for it.

01:25:47.136 --> 01:25:48.193
Ahh!!!

01:26:00.869 --> 01:26:02.130
Oh my god.

01:26:20.336 --> 01:26:21.427
Paul!

01:27:00.570 --> 01:27:02.195
Do you ever get tired of being wrong?

01:27:32.021 --> 01:27:32.987
You got it?

01:27:33.821 --> 01:27:35.912
Reggie, run the
emergency backup protocol.

01:27:36.054 --> 01:27:36.747
I'm on it.

01:27:37.654 --> 01:27:38.620
Cheryl, you okay?

01:27:38.754 --> 01:27:39.720
I'm fine.

01:27:40.787 --> 01:27:42.776
l thought Ivan said
the solar burst missed us.

01:27:42.921 --> 01:27:46.876
It did, we just got sucker punched
by the solar radiation cone.

01:27:47.021 --> 01:27:49.885
Dammit, trust me this
is going to be bad enough

01:27:50.021 --> 01:27:50.884
How bad?

01:27:51.021 --> 01:27:52.850
The sun's gone hyperactive,

01:27:52.988 --> 01:27:55.113
coronal mass ejection solar flares.

01:27:55.954 --> 01:27:56.885
The whole planet is going to get hit

01:27:57.021 --> 01:27:58.247
by electromagnetic pulses,

01:27:58.387 --> 01:28:01.820
electrical storms,
solar radiation bursts.

01:28:01.954 --> 01:28:03.681
Maybe even some earthquakes,

01:28:03.821 --> 01:28:06.252
caused by the distortion
in the magnetosphere.

01:28:06.387 --> 01:28:08.148
Day or night its not
going to make a difference.

01:28:08.287 --> 01:28:09.310
What's the end game?

01:28:09.454 --> 01:28:10.886
Either the sun calms
down on its own or...

01:28:11.021 --> 01:28:14.919
we can count the days earth
has left on one hand. Reggie?

01:28:28.854 --> 01:28:31.047
What happened?
The generators blew out.

01:28:31.954 --> 01:28:34.818
l don't know but whatever
it is our friends are back,

01:28:34.954 --> 01:28:36.476
its killed their trucks.

01:28:36.621 --> 01:28:38.109
Could be an EMP of some kind.

01:28:38.253 --> 01:28:41.651
Might be something to do
with what happened to Alan.

01:28:41.787 --> 01:28:42.844
What's an EMP?

01:28:42.988 --> 01:28:44.715
Electromagnetic pulse.

01:28:44.854 --> 01:28:48.877
Overloads all electronic circuits,
generators, auto ignitions.

01:28:49.021 --> 01:28:51.680
l want you to find Nourhan
and take her back to my tent.

01:28:51.821 --> 01:28:54.378
l don't want them finding her
when their coming down here.

01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:59.343
ls there anything l can do for you?

01:29:00.687 --> 01:29:04.710
Yeah. Can you be there when it
hits me that my husband is dead.

01:29:05.654 --> 01:29:07.677
l just don't think
that I'm taking it in.

01:29:09.054 --> 01:29:10.042
Have you heard from JJ?

01:29:10.187 --> 01:29:12.745
No. Phone's dead. Internet's down.

01:29:13.287 --> 01:29:14.753
I've never felt so cut off

01:29:21.153 --> 01:29:22.244
What is that?

01:29:35.449 --> 01:29:36.415
We need to find the Vice President

01:29:36.549 --> 01:29:40.504
and get him to the bunker also the
Speaker and The Secretary of State.

01:29:40.649 --> 01:29:41.808
And Laura.

01:29:41.949 --> 01:29:43.779
Secret service is looking for her.

01:29:44.382 --> 01:29:46.473
Your telling me nobody knows
where the hell my daughter is?

01:29:46.616 --> 01:29:48.775
She was pretty scared. She's
somewhere in the White House.

01:29:48.915 --> 01:29:51.245
We'll bring her here as soon
as we find her Mr. President.

01:29:51.382 --> 01:29:53.678
Have we made any contact
with other heads of state?

01:29:53.816 --> 01:29:56.407
France, England and Moscow before
communications went down.

01:29:56.549 --> 01:29:57.912
It's a global situation.

01:29:58.049 --> 01:30:00.208
We managed to get word out on
the Emergency Broadcasting System

01:30:00.349 --> 01:30:01.508
to state and local bodies.

01:30:01.649 --> 01:30:02.580
We're doing the best we can.

01:30:02.716 --> 01:30:03.773
Stay on it.

01:30:03.915 --> 01:30:06.507
l want in five minutes
what we doing with here.

01:30:06.683 --> 01:30:09.807
What we can expect.
l communicate at home.

01:30:09.982 --> 01:30:11.039
Mr. President.

01:30:12.583 --> 01:30:16.413
Perhaps you would like some time to
process what's happened to your wife.

01:30:16.549 --> 01:30:19.174
I'm grieving Roger,
not incapacitated.

01:30:19.316 --> 01:30:21.804
There's a difference.
Don't forget that.

01:30:47.683 --> 01:30:48.512
Rebeca!

01:30:48.649 --> 01:30:49.978
We haven't got time!

01:30:50.115 --> 01:30:51.138
Run!

01:31:06.249 --> 01:31:07.340
Run!

01:31:10.115 --> 01:31:10.842
Go, go!

01:31:10.982 --> 01:31:11.879
No!

01:31:29.683 --> 01:31:34.411
Come baby, come inside...
come Freddie, Freddie come!

01:31:34.549 --> 01:31:35.515
No!

01:31:41.049 --> 01:31:41.980
Freddie!

01:31:42.115 --> 01:31:43.376
Let go of me.

01:31:44.349 --> 01:31:45.406
Freddie!

01:31:47.649 --> 01:31:48.773
Freddie!

01:31:53.982 --> 01:31:55.777
What systems do
we still have on line here?

01:31:55.915 --> 01:31:58.313
Roebling had many of
the systems EMP hardened.

01:31:58.982 --> 01:32:00.448
Question is if it still works.

01:32:03.815 --> 01:32:04.906
Mission control.

01:32:06.382 --> 01:32:08.711
Dr. Bakus! We're getting
something from the Space Station.

01:32:08.849 --> 01:32:11.611
Space Station to mission control.

01:32:11.748 --> 01:32:14.214
I'm struggling to get systems back up.

01:32:14.349 --> 01:32:15.871
Ivan, What's your situation?

01:32:16.015 --> 01:32:17.481
Not good.

01:32:17.616 --> 01:32:20.740
We've lost power and are
in a deteriorating orbit.

01:32:20.882 --> 01:32:22.745
Ivan, this is Commander Wincroft.

01:32:22.882 --> 01:32:24.814
Can you boost back to a better orbit?

01:32:24.949 --> 01:32:25.937
No.

01:32:26.082 --> 01:32:27.775
Well what about evacuation?

01:32:27.915 --> 01:32:30.211
The blast damaged our Soyuz pods.

01:32:30.349 --> 01:32:32.611
We're trying to repair them now, but..

01:32:32.748 --> 01:32:33.873
Keep working on it buddy.

01:32:34.015 --> 01:32:34.981
Yes, yes.

01:32:35.115 --> 01:32:39.104
We're also collecting a ton of
information from our sensors.

01:32:39.249 --> 01:32:41.647
l will download what l can, when l..

01:32:43.149 --> 01:32:44.342
Ivan, what is it?

01:32:44.715 --> 01:32:47.375
I'm, looking at Earth.

01:32:48.549 --> 01:32:49.446
How does it look?

01:32:49.583 --> 01:32:52.413
Like, like hell.

01:33:00.483 --> 01:33:01.506
l need a status meeting.

01:33:01.648 --> 01:33:03.478
Oh a meeting. I'll call for donuts.

01:33:03.616 --> 01:33:05.548
l need to know what
resources we have available,

01:33:05.682 --> 01:33:07.841
What our level of
disaster preparedness is.

01:33:07.982 --> 01:33:10.278
We need all ears and eyes
up as quick as possible Don.

01:33:10.416 --> 01:33:12.348
Can't afford to have
our people get off task.

01:33:12.483 --> 01:33:14.142
l don't need you permission Craig

01:33:14.282 --> 01:33:15.077
Like hell you don't

01:33:15.216 --> 01:33:18.773
This is now a federal facility and
the President put Don in charge

01:33:18.915 --> 01:33:20.404
ah, a lot of good that did.

01:33:20.549 --> 01:33:22.105
It wasn't my ship where
the problem started pal.

01:33:22.249 --> 01:33:22.873
Ya , but...

01:33:23.015 --> 01:33:26.175
Do we have to play out our
whole sad relationship right here

01:33:28.882 --> 01:33:30.508
alright, its all yours.

01:33:31.049 --> 01:33:31.810
Listen up everyone.

01:33:31.949 --> 01:33:35.177
l need you to stop what
you're doing just for a moment.

01:33:35.915 --> 01:33:38.904
l need a status update.
What's working for us and what isn't?

01:33:39.049 --> 01:33:41.072
Well, we have some pretty
crappy communications.

01:33:41.216 --> 01:33:42.580
Define "crappy."

01:33:42.715 --> 01:33:44.443
Well, we still have contact
with the space station

01:33:44.583 --> 01:33:47.140
and that's fine we can scan
some government frequencies,

01:33:47.282 --> 01:33:49.544
but it's dead quiet out there.

01:33:49.682 --> 01:33:50.909
I'm thinking most
people are still trying

01:33:51.049 --> 01:33:52.947
to get their
communications back online.

01:33:53.082 --> 01:33:55.048
What about cell phones or land lines?

01:33:55.182 --> 01:33:56.045
No...nothing

01:33:56.182 --> 01:33:59.512
Tracking systems? Telemetry?
Satellites? GPS?

01:34:00.049 --> 01:34:01.708
We have some power to
one of our radio dishes,

01:34:01.849 --> 01:34:02.678
but we can't turn it.

01:34:02.815 --> 01:34:04.145
Looks like the motor is burned out.

01:34:04.282 --> 01:34:05.339
Can it be fixed?

01:34:05.483 --> 01:34:09.279
l don't know,
but.. l really need to leave.

01:34:09.416 --> 01:34:10.574
l haven't heard from my husband

01:34:10.715 --> 01:34:15.512
and l don't know if he and my little
girl are okay. I'm sorry, l gotta go.

01:34:15.648 --> 01:34:17.308
Look, l don't think your
car is going to be working.

01:34:17.449 --> 01:34:20.074
I'll walk. l don't live too far away.

01:34:20.216 --> 01:34:20.977
Alright listen up everyone.

01:34:21.115 --> 01:34:24.013
We are in the middle
of a global crisis.

01:34:24.149 --> 01:34:27.343
Everyone here are the best
people to monitor the situation.

01:34:27.483 --> 01:34:30.506
Everyone here is
also private contractor Don.

01:34:31.648 --> 01:34:33.580
Your boss is now dead,

01:34:34.615 --> 01:34:36.411
and the world is staring
down the barrel of a gun.

01:34:36.548 --> 01:34:38.639
As far as I'm concerned
your contract is up.

01:34:38.782 --> 01:34:40.248
Go home and see your husband..

01:34:41.449 --> 01:34:43.438
We will continue to
monitor every channel,

01:34:43.582 --> 01:34:47.708
collect and disseminate whatever
information we can to whomever we can.

01:34:47.849 --> 01:34:50.838
Nobody here is under any responsibility
to listen to the people

01:34:50.982 --> 01:34:54.471
that got you into this nightmare
in the first place. Go home.

01:34:55.516 --> 01:34:57.505
Reggie, specifics.

01:34:57.648 --> 01:34:58.046
Yeah,

01:34:58.182 --> 01:34:59.409
Let's look at that motor.

01:34:59.548 --> 01:35:00.878
Craig I'd like a minute.

01:35:08.216 --> 01:35:09.045
Has my daughter been found?

01:35:09.182 --> 01:35:10.545
Not yet, Mr. President.

01:35:11.548 --> 01:35:13.980
Did you, or did you not
send someone to find her?

01:35:14.115 --> 01:35:16.546
We're in the middle of
a global crisis, dammit!

01:35:19.349 --> 01:35:21.974
Mr. President, you shouldn't
leave the operations center.

01:35:25.316 --> 01:35:27.441
This is not Don's fault.

01:35:27.582 --> 01:35:29.014
We could just as easily blame the guy

01:35:29.149 --> 01:35:31.580
who designed the Roebling
Clipper for the mess we're all in.

01:35:31.715 --> 01:35:32.976
Maybe we should.

01:35:33.115 --> 01:35:34.512
No. We shouldn't.

01:35:35.515 --> 01:35:38.004
This has always been your problem.

01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:40.512
You think if something bad happens
and it's got to be someone fault.

01:35:40.648 --> 01:35:42.546
Well guess what,
it doesn't work like that.

01:35:43.648 --> 01:35:45.944
Life's a lot more complicated.

01:35:46.082 --> 01:35:47.809
We're losing the space station.

01:36:35.249 --> 01:36:36.112
Ivan?

01:36:37.115 --> 01:36:38.910
Craig, my friend.

01:36:39.049 --> 01:36:42.606
l am going to send you
the data I've collected,

01:36:42.748 --> 01:36:47.044
but in case l run out of time
here is everything we know.

01:36:47.182 --> 01:36:50.205
Our worst scenario is confirmed.

01:36:50.349 --> 01:36:55.372
The intensity of the solar impact
on Earth will continue to grow.

01:36:55.515 --> 01:36:59.039
Whatever satellites are
still operational will fail.

01:36:59.182 --> 01:37:03.671
Whatever communications
you have will be shut down.

01:37:03.815 --> 01:37:06.576
Our readings from up here show that

01:37:06.715 --> 01:37:11.477
the sun is pouring out massive
amounts of subatomic particles

01:37:11.615 --> 01:37:16.980
that will keep on striking the earth,
eventually sterilizing the planet.

01:37:18.349 --> 01:37:19.473
How certain are
your readings Commander?

01:37:19.615 --> 01:37:21.206
Ivan is a solar physicist, Don.

01:37:21.349 --> 01:37:23.780
It is a mathematical certainty.

01:37:23.915 --> 01:37:30.404
The earth can survive for
perhaps two more days. Maximum.

01:37:33.548 --> 01:37:34.536
Ivan...

01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:36.614
Don't be sorry for us up here...

01:37:36.748 --> 01:37:41.442
I'm afraid to say..
we're the lucky ones. Good luck.

01:37:52.415 --> 01:37:53.540
Go home.

01:38:07.682 --> 01:38:12.410
Freddie! Have you seen Freddie?

01:38:13.915 --> 01:38:14.881
Freddie!

01:38:21.082 --> 01:38:22.173
Freddie!

01:38:24.715 --> 01:38:27.442
Marta, Marta,

01:38:28.249 --> 01:38:29.112
Freddie!

01:38:29.915 --> 01:38:31.642
l found him a few blocks from here.

01:38:31.949 --> 01:38:34.437
Never do that to me again, OK?

01:38:34.582 --> 01:38:36.048
We have to stay together.

01:38:38.115 --> 01:38:41.206
Listen , if there is
anything you need, you find me.

01:38:41.348 --> 01:38:42.336
Thank you.

01:38:42.949 --> 01:38:44.812
l know it's a hard time but,

01:38:44.949 --> 01:38:47.437
Claire's calling for a town
meeting in the high school gym,

01:38:47.582 --> 01:38:49.445
to go over the town's disaster plan.

01:38:49.582 --> 01:38:50.570
I'm not up to that.

01:38:50.715 --> 01:38:53.374
l know but you're
the only nurse in town.

01:38:53.849 --> 01:38:54.974
Look it's important to be there

01:38:55.115 --> 01:38:57.603
but I'm sure no one will
blame you if you stay home.

01:38:59.381 --> 01:39:01.438
You want me to walk you
back so l can tell your mother?

01:39:01.582 --> 01:39:04.742
No, no, I'll... I'll do that. Thank you.

01:39:05.682 --> 01:39:11.672
Marta, I'm really sorry about Jose.
He was a good guy.

01:39:13.915 --> 01:39:15.040
Thank you.

01:39:22.381 --> 01:39:24.745
Hey look people,
we're going to go this way.

01:39:44.082 --> 01:39:45.604
Son of a bitch.

01:39:57.415 --> 01:40:00.347
This is Roebling Spaceport
in Mountcastle, Virginia,

01:40:00.482 --> 01:40:02.073
can anyone hear me?

01:40:02.215 --> 01:40:03.408
l can hear you Reggie.

01:40:04.448 --> 01:40:05.539
Go home man.

01:40:05.682 --> 01:40:06.841
Go be with your family.

01:40:08.982 --> 01:40:10.470
My family's in Portland.

01:40:12.715 --> 01:40:17.841
Ya, so the chances of me getting
back there before, you know..

01:40:17.982 --> 01:40:19.141
Slim.

01:40:19.748 --> 01:40:23.271
Yeah, you know what though?

01:40:23.415 --> 01:40:24.642
Ya know l am a nerd.

01:40:24.782 --> 01:40:26.338
So if I'm going to go,

01:40:26.482 --> 01:40:28.471
it's going to be with
a keyboard in my hand

01:40:32.315 --> 01:40:34.907
There's nobody special you want
to spend the last few days with?

01:40:36.482 --> 01:40:40.676
Yeah, yeah there is. Umm...
she's with someone else though.

01:40:42.682 --> 01:40:43.943
What about you?

01:40:45.748 --> 01:40:47.044
Same here.

01:40:51.949 --> 01:40:53.312
l think it stopped

01:40:55.448 --> 01:40:56.505
...Paul!

01:40:57.248 --> 01:41:00.806
l think l broke my leg,
and might have busted a rib too.

01:41:02.715 --> 01:41:03.840
I'll go get help.

01:41:56.782 --> 01:41:57.873
Nourhan.

01:41:58.315 --> 01:41:59.872
Are you okay?

01:42:03.815 --> 01:42:05.280
l know we're missing something.

01:42:05.415 --> 01:42:06.540
Like what?

01:42:06.682 --> 01:42:07.773
l...

01:42:08.415 --> 01:42:12.575
Craig, hey you're
the smartest guy l know.

01:42:12.715 --> 01:42:14.340
What haven't we thought of?

01:42:14.482 --> 01:42:16.744
You mean to stop the sun
from destroying us?

01:42:16.882 --> 01:42:18.370
There's got to be something we can do.

01:42:18.515 --> 01:42:19.845
It's the sun, Don..

01:42:19.982 --> 01:42:22.846
It's a fusion furnace burning at
six thousand degrees Celsius

01:42:22.982 --> 01:42:24.174
on it's surface,

01:42:24.315 --> 01:42:27.009
its ninety-three million miles away.

01:42:27.148 --> 01:42:29.808
No. There's nothing we can do.

01:42:29.949 --> 01:42:31.209
l won't except that.

01:42:31.815 --> 01:42:33.144
The sun doesn't seem to care.

01:42:33.281 --> 01:42:34.907
I'm not ready to give up yet.

01:42:35.448 --> 01:42:37.710
You can't "hero" us
out of this situation, Don.

01:42:42.148 --> 01:42:43.546
Cheryl, where are you going?

01:42:44.515 --> 01:42:45.640
l don't know,

01:42:45.782 --> 01:42:46.839
but I'm not going to
spend what little time

01:42:46.982 --> 01:42:48.777
l have left in this building.

01:42:48.915 --> 01:42:53.904
Jesus Don, take her away.
If you don't...l will.

01:42:57.381 --> 01:42:58.745
Ya l guess you're right.

01:43:00.849 --> 01:43:04.975
Let's ah.. see if we
can find a car that works.

01:43:06.081 --> 01:43:09.605
Try to get back home
to Silver Spring huh?

01:43:10.582 --> 01:43:11.843
Thank you.

01:43:16.682 --> 01:43:20.045
Craig come with us.

01:43:22.014 --> 01:43:24.037
You guys should be alone.
Just go ahead.

01:43:24.915 --> 01:43:30.404
Huh, Cheryl's right Craig Come on,
come with us.

01:43:31.148 --> 01:43:33.080
There's too much history between us.

01:43:33.715 --> 01:43:35.203
We use to be like a family.

01:43:35.815 --> 01:43:39.008
A dysfunctional family,
but still a family.

01:43:39.482 --> 01:43:40.778
Ya, thanks anyway.

01:43:42.048 --> 01:43:44.014
You guys go and us get out of here.

01:43:45.815 --> 01:43:47.178
I'll wait it out here.

01:43:47.315 --> 01:43:48.713
Alright, well you uh...

01:43:48.849 --> 01:43:49.678
Take care of yourself then.

01:43:49.815 --> 01:43:50.940
Ya, you too.

01:43:51.949 --> 01:43:53.505
It was a helluva ride brother.

01:43:54.048 --> 01:43:56.276
Ya well, it wasn't boring,
I'll give it that.

01:44:00.882 --> 01:44:03.370
Maybe one day you'll explain
to me how l lost you

01:44:03.515 --> 01:44:06.310
One day you'll have to explain
to me how you let me go.

01:44:19.415 --> 01:44:20.745
Wait...

01:44:31.348 --> 01:44:32.575
here.

01:44:37.815 --> 01:44:39.371
l remember this picture.

01:44:40.181 --> 01:44:41.169
Yeah,

01:44:45.615 --> 01:44:46.944
take it,

01:44:49.615 --> 01:44:50.876
good luck.

01:46:06.148 --> 01:46:07.239
Mr. President, over here.

01:46:10.815 --> 01:46:13.838
Honey, are you okay? Huh?

01:46:19.315 --> 01:46:23.111
Shh. It's okay, it's okay honey.

01:46:23.848 --> 01:46:27.042
We're going to be fine. Look at me.

01:46:28.148 --> 01:46:31.046
Lara we're going to be fine, okay?

01:46:34.848 --> 01:46:38.076
Daddy, what's happening outside...

01:46:39.048 --> 01:46:40.810
would it have happened anyway?

01:46:41.748 --> 01:46:44.213
l mean, even if mom wasn't on that ship?

01:46:45.881 --> 01:46:47.507
Yes honey, yes.

01:46:50.081 --> 01:46:57.242
Daddy...what happened to mom,
it's not your fault.

01:46:59.315 --> 01:47:00.645
I'm sorry l said it was.

01:47:00.782 --> 01:47:02.213
l know.

01:47:08.348 --> 01:47:10.746
I'm supposed to be the most
powerful man in the world.

01:47:11.881 --> 01:47:13.177
Good joke huh?

01:47:53.014 --> 01:47:54.173
Wait a minute!

01:47:57.548 --> 01:47:59.343
Don! Don!

01:48:01.781 --> 01:48:04.145
You never told me
why NASA wanted you here today.

01:48:04.281 --> 01:48:06.940
Why you know so much
about scalar drive technology.

01:48:07.948 --> 01:48:10.210
NASA's got their own scalar drive,
don't they?

01:48:10.348 --> 01:48:12.836
They took your plans and modified them.

01:48:12.981 --> 01:48:16.038
They had Roebling over clock
the scalar on the Clipper

01:48:16.181 --> 01:48:17.647
as an experiment.

01:48:17.781 --> 01:48:20.475
NASA wanted to see if they could
increase the energy output.

01:48:20.615 --> 01:48:22.205
Roebling knew about it and approved it?

01:48:22.348 --> 01:48:23.279
Yeah, but l didn't.

01:48:23.415 --> 01:48:25.846
You knew NASA took Craig's plans
and didn't stop them?

01:48:25.981 --> 01:48:28.447
l objected but they did it anyway.

01:48:28.582 --> 01:48:30.013
Why is this important right now?

01:48:30.148 --> 01:48:32.614
Because the solar mess that's
killing the earth was caused

01:48:32.747 --> 01:48:35.145
by a scalar drive
impacting the sun's surface.

01:48:35.281 --> 01:48:37.838
Scalar power is phased. It's polarized,

01:48:37.981 --> 01:48:40.243
and do you know how to
turn a scalar drive off?

01:48:40.381 --> 01:48:41.472
You flip its polarity,

01:48:41.615 --> 01:48:43.978
you just cancel its phase down to zero.

01:48:44.114 --> 01:48:48.103
Now, the scalar drive that impacted
on the sun's surface, its phased on...

01:48:48.248 --> 01:48:50.305
the sun doesn't have the ability
on its own to flip polarity

01:48:50.448 --> 01:48:52.141
to cancel it out.

01:48:52.281 --> 01:48:54.838
But another scalar drive
impacted the sun would.

01:48:54.981 --> 01:48:56.345
Bingo!

01:48:56.482 --> 01:48:59.777
I'm very attracted to you right now.
That's exactly right.

01:49:00.348 --> 01:49:01.779
We've only got two days.

01:49:02.348 --> 01:49:05.439
It's impossible to get NASA's
scalar drive to the sun in time.

01:49:05.582 --> 01:49:07.047
Not necessarily.

01:49:12.914 --> 01:49:15.506
How are things?
Any success raising anyone?

01:49:15.648 --> 01:49:18.341
Mr. President,
can l speak to you in private?

01:49:18.482 --> 01:49:20.141
Why don't you say it here, Roger?

01:49:23.515 --> 01:49:24.276
Thomas, please.

01:49:24.415 --> 01:49:25.778
I'll make it easy for you.

01:49:26.381 --> 01:49:29.972
l do not accept your invoking of
the Presidential Succession Act.

01:49:30.714 --> 01:49:32.078
Now today was a difficult day,

01:49:32.215 --> 01:49:33.874
not just for me but
for the entire world,

01:49:34.014 --> 01:49:38.379
and we have more hard days
ahead of us. But l will lead.

01:49:38.515 --> 01:49:40.878
l have a duty to protect our country.

01:49:41.014 --> 01:49:42.480
As do l.

01:49:44.348 --> 01:49:47.677
So the Air Force stole my design
and built their own Clipper?

01:49:47.814 --> 01:49:50.939
Roebling had to vet your plan with
NASA, that was part of his deal.

01:49:51.081 --> 01:49:54.138
The Air Force took the plans and
built their own experimental ship.

01:49:54.281 --> 01:49:55.269
The X-57.

01:49:55.415 --> 01:49:57.278
How close is it in
design to the Clipper?

01:49:57.415 --> 01:50:00.347
It's similar.
They made some improvements.

01:50:00.482 --> 01:50:03.936
Advanced propulsion, a solar
shield, hot-swappable pods.

01:50:04.081 --> 01:50:05.513
And it has a scalar engine?

01:50:05.647 --> 01:50:07.580
It uses nuclear pulse propulsion.

01:50:07.714 --> 01:50:10.078
It will get us to the sun
in just under nine hours.

01:50:10.215 --> 01:50:12.113
So where's the scalar drive?

01:50:12.248 --> 01:50:13.544
It's in the cargo bay.

01:50:14.482 --> 01:50:16.311
Why would they put
it in the cargo bay?

01:50:16.448 --> 01:50:19.505
They weaponized it. It's a bomb.

01:50:20.348 --> 01:50:22.075
Hold on a second,
did l miss something?

01:50:22.215 --> 01:50:24.147
Somebody weaponized a scalar drive?

01:50:24.281 --> 01:50:25.247
Shut up.

01:50:27.148 --> 01:50:28.670
Okay, so where's the ship?

01:50:28.814 --> 01:50:30.041
Hopper Air Force base.

01:50:30.181 --> 01:50:31.612
How do we know it'll still fly?

01:50:31.747 --> 01:50:33.610
The X-57 is EMP hardened.

01:50:33.747 --> 01:50:35.838
So if we can get you to Hopper,
can you fly the thing?

01:50:35.981 --> 01:50:38.640
Absolutely. l was lead test pilot.

01:50:38.781 --> 01:50:42.611
She's only flown sub-orbital,
but she's ready.

01:50:42.747 --> 01:50:43.974
It'll go into space.

01:50:44.114 --> 01:50:47.205
The bigger problem is that Hopper
is two hundred miles from here.

01:50:47.348 --> 01:50:48.870
Well you could take my car.

01:50:50.215 --> 01:50:53.375
Roger,unless it's a classic
it's not likely to work.

01:50:53.515 --> 01:50:54.912
Oh, she's a classic.

01:50:55.647 --> 01:50:56.635
Operations center.

01:50:56.781 --> 01:50:59.611
Repeat, this is the Presidential
Emergency Operations Center.

01:50:59.747 --> 01:51:02.043
-If anyone reads this, please respond.
-OK, I'll put it up on the big screen.

01:51:07.315 --> 01:51:08.303
We're getting something.

01:51:08.448 --> 01:51:10.675
This is Roebling Spaceport
in Mountcastle, Virginia.

01:51:10.814 --> 01:51:12.337
We read you PEOC.

01:51:12.482 --> 01:51:13.448
This is Cheryl Wincroft,

01:51:13.581 --> 01:51:15.706
Science Adviser to President Mathany.

01:51:15.848 --> 01:51:17.643
ls the President alright?

01:51:17.781 --> 01:51:21.043
Cheryl, this is Tom.
l am so glad to hear from you.

01:51:21.181 --> 01:51:23.409
What the hell's going on?

01:51:23.547 --> 01:51:25.570
It's pretty much our worst fears,
Mr. President.

01:51:26.614 --> 01:51:28.739
Please tell me that your
husbands have a plan.

01:51:29.881 --> 01:51:31.211
They do, Mr. President.

01:51:33.114 --> 01:51:34.670
Okay everyone, okay everyone.

01:51:34.814 --> 01:51:36.144
Come in and settle down.

01:51:39.614 --> 01:51:42.376
Just before the phones went
down l spoke to the Governor.

01:51:42.514 --> 01:51:44.276
Here's what we know.

01:51:44.415 --> 01:51:47.869
The same accident
that took Jose from us

01:51:48.014 --> 01:51:50.480
also caused this
situation we're now in.

01:51:50.614 --> 01:51:52.103
What's happening here

01:51:52.248 --> 01:51:54.271
is happening everywhere
around the world

01:51:54.415 --> 01:51:57.006
and we have no idea
how long it's going to last.

01:51:57.148 --> 01:52:00.308
We can't count on any help from
the state or federal government.

01:52:00.448 --> 01:52:02.471
We are on our own.

01:52:02.614 --> 01:52:05.479
So we're declaring the
"Town of Eden Disaster Plan"

01:52:05.614 --> 01:52:07.739
in effect as of right now...

01:52:07.881 --> 01:52:11.041
Members of the disaster committee,
please raise your hand.

01:52:12.348 --> 01:52:14.870
They will be coming around
to all of your houses

01:52:15.014 --> 01:52:19.140
and collecting all of your food,
medicines, and batteries.

01:52:21.481 --> 01:52:22.970
Hold it down, everyone

01:52:23.814 --> 01:52:28.440
We need to pool and ration
everything we have as a community.

01:52:28.581 --> 01:52:31.741
It will all going be centrally
distributed right from here.

01:52:32.348 --> 01:52:34.939
Now those of us who have
more than enough of something

01:52:35.081 --> 01:52:37.876
will be able to help those
of us without enough.

01:52:38.315 --> 01:52:42.179
And l promise you, by the time this
thing is over every single one of us

01:52:42.315 --> 01:52:45.042
is going to need something
that somebody else has.

01:52:45.547 --> 01:52:46.706
Next,

01:52:46.848 --> 01:52:51.576
l need everybody that owns a gun
or a rifle to volunteer for patrol duty.

01:52:51.714 --> 01:52:53.873
Why do we need an armed patrol?

01:52:54.014 --> 01:52:58.310
Because we're closing all roads
in and out of Eden to outsiders,

01:52:58.447 --> 01:53:01.073
The patrol will enforce that...

01:53:01.215 --> 01:53:03.340
Look l know it sounds harsh,

01:53:03.481 --> 01:53:06.004
l know that one or two people
coming into our town

01:53:06.148 --> 01:53:09.012
and enjoying our charity
won't deplete our reserves,

01:53:09.148 --> 01:53:12.080
but one or two will lead to hundreds.

01:53:12.581 --> 01:53:15.741
And once we become known as
a place that takes in outsiders

01:53:15.881 --> 01:53:20.371
we will be overrun and
then nobody will survive.

01:53:20.514 --> 01:53:22.912
Not them, and not us.

01:53:23.048 --> 01:53:24.479
This is not the Christian way!

01:53:24.614 --> 01:53:30.138
Well, l would rather see us all survive
as people than die as Christians.

01:53:31.581 --> 01:53:33.706
Anybody here disagree with that?

01:53:35.981 --> 01:53:37.446
Good.

01:53:38.747 --> 01:53:43.237
Any outsider who tries to get
into our town must turn away.

01:53:43.714 --> 01:53:48.612
And anyone who doesn't turn away
must be turned away forcefully.

01:53:51.547 --> 01:53:52.241
Rebeca!

01:53:52.380 --> 01:53:53.369
Paul.

01:53:53.514 --> 01:53:54.344
Rebeca!

01:53:54.481 --> 01:53:55.674
She didn't make it

01:53:55.814 --> 01:53:56.643
You don't know that.

01:53:56.781 --> 01:53:59.145
Yes l do... l do.

01:54:01.848 --> 01:54:02.404
Listen to me.

01:54:02.547 --> 01:54:05.013
We have to stay focused
on saving as many as we can.

01:54:05.148 --> 01:54:07.239
Are you listening?
Because l need you.

01:54:08.048 --> 01:54:09.741
Yeah, yeah, I'm listening.

01:54:09.881 --> 01:54:12.245
Alright, so if another
electrical storm comes in,

01:54:12.380 --> 01:54:14.176
can we all survive in those pipes?

01:54:15.315 --> 01:54:17.974
No. We're too exposed.

01:54:18.914 --> 01:54:22.312
We need a safe shelter and
food and some clean water.

01:54:23.614 --> 01:54:24.807
Mehrzad's bunkers.

01:54:24.948 --> 01:54:26.675
He's hoarding plenty
of food and clean water.

01:54:26.814 --> 01:54:28.404
We go, make a deal with him

01:54:28.547 --> 01:54:31.275
Counting on a warlord to be
compassionate is your plan?

01:54:31.414 --> 01:54:34.471
I'm counting on finding an
alternative along the way

01:54:34.614 --> 01:54:37.637
and his gratitude for us reuniting
him with his daughter

01:54:38.114 --> 01:54:39.670
Are you sure about this?

01:54:40.581 --> 01:54:44.980
The man she was supposed to marry
has died and he's still a parent.

01:54:46.215 --> 01:54:48.510
I'd give anything to
be with JJ right now.

01:54:48.647 --> 01:54:51.943
Come here! Come!

01:54:52.581 --> 01:54:54.877
Have everyone look for
as much clean water

01:54:55.014 --> 01:54:56.809
and we're leaving as soon as possible.

01:55:08.681 --> 01:55:10.738
Are you absolutely sure about this?

01:55:12.681 --> 01:55:15.579
Everyday, the solar effects
will multiply exponentially.

01:55:16.347 --> 01:55:18.211
It's our only hope
of turning things around.

01:55:19.781 --> 01:55:21.337
Captain Wincroft? Do you agree?

01:55:22.314 --> 01:55:23.439
l do.

01:55:26.814 --> 01:55:28.302
Well, please forgive me
for being so blunt,

01:55:28.447 --> 01:55:29.777
but why should l trust the two people

01:55:29.914 --> 01:55:31.743
who should have seen
this coming and didn't.

01:55:31.881 --> 01:55:33.506
Three people, Mr. President.

01:55:33.647 --> 01:55:35.442
All due respect sir,

01:55:35.581 --> 01:55:37.945
if you got another option
we would love to hear it.

01:55:42.481 --> 01:55:43.606
Do it.

01:55:44.547 --> 01:55:46.445
ls there anything
we can do for you from here?

01:55:46.581 --> 01:55:50.536
There is sir, if there's anybody
left at Hopper's Air force base,

01:55:50.681 --> 01:55:51.840
let them know we're on our way

01:55:51.981 --> 01:55:54.209
and to have the X-57 fueled and ready.

01:55:55.414 --> 01:55:56.812
We'll do our best.

01:55:56.948 --> 01:56:00.244
Reggie, let's see this car of yours.

01:56:04.347 --> 01:56:07.336
Thomas, you can't authorize
use of the X-57.

01:56:07.481 --> 01:56:09.504
It's powered by thermonuclear charges.

01:56:09.647 --> 01:56:12.340
That might make
the situation on earth worse.

01:56:12.481 --> 01:56:16.243
Worse than what?
You heard Wincroft and Bakus.

01:56:16.781 --> 01:56:18.246
We need to look into this more.

01:56:18.380 --> 01:56:19.074
Get more opinions.

01:56:19.215 --> 01:56:19.942
Not to mention that

01:56:20.081 --> 01:56:23.013
this is a violation of
the nuclear test ban treaty!

01:56:24.814 --> 01:56:27.473
Roger, l need you to try and calm down.

01:56:27.614 --> 01:56:30.206
You're potentially authorizing
the destruction of the world

01:56:30.347 --> 01:56:32.745
and I'm the one
that needs to calm down?

01:56:33.814 --> 01:56:35.212
I'm sorry, Roger.

01:56:36.647 --> 01:56:38.306
CORPORAL, -Yes, sir

01:56:39.114 --> 01:56:41.602
l want Mr. Lynch
removed from the PEOC.

01:56:41.747 --> 01:56:44.372
Place send him in
the executive briefing room.

01:56:44.514 --> 01:56:45.707
Yes, sir...

01:56:45.848 --> 01:56:47.438
Mr. Lynch, please come with me.

01:56:48.948 --> 01:56:52.778
l take no responsibility for the
results of the course of this action

01:56:53.547 --> 01:56:55.513
You're all complicit in this

01:56:56.414 --> 01:56:57.573
l know the way.

01:57:07.181 --> 01:57:08.407
There it is, it's the blue one

01:57:09.081 --> 01:57:10.341
l thought you said it was a classic

01:57:10.481 --> 01:57:10.970
It is..

01:57:11.114 --> 01:57:12.204
It's a 1970...

01:57:12.347 --> 01:57:13.904
It's a 1970 original.

01:57:14.048 --> 01:57:16.445
We're supposed to stop the
earth from burning up in that?

01:57:16.581 --> 01:57:19.139
It's nice to see that God
hasn't lost his sense of humor.

01:57:20.247 --> 01:57:21.145
Whoa!

01:57:21.714 --> 01:57:22.839
You were saying?

01:57:24.180 --> 01:57:25.271
Get into the car.

01:57:27.081 --> 01:57:28.637
Start it up... Come on buddy.

01:57:28.781 --> 01:57:31.269
Come on! Come on!

01:57:31.414 --> 01:57:32.142
Calm down Reggie!

01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:35.940
I'm trying to start it... Come on baby.

01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:56.576
How you feeling, Dr. Bakus?

01:57:59.048 --> 01:58:01.206
Like the guy who jumped off
the Empire State Building

01:58:01.347 --> 01:58:03.609
and halfway down he goes
" hey,so far so good."

01:58:04.314 --> 01:58:06.576
l think that's the first time
I've heard you tell a joke.

01:58:06.714 --> 01:58:09.475
If l don't get this job done
it'll probably be the last time, huh.

01:58:11.747 --> 01:58:13.906
What do you think is going on
around the world right now?

01:58:14.048 --> 01:58:17.037
l guess that depends on how bad
the solar anomalies are playing out.

01:58:17.180 --> 01:58:18.237
No l mean, with the people.

01:58:18.380 --> 01:58:20.938
l mean are people rioting?

01:58:21.081 --> 01:58:22.376
Are they finding religion?

01:58:22.514 --> 01:58:23.480
Are they helping each other out?

01:58:23.614 --> 01:58:25.103
Oh, God knows Reggie.

01:58:25.814 --> 01:58:28.007
l don't exactly have highest
regard for people's ability

01:58:28.147 --> 01:58:29.875
to act civilly under pressure.

01:58:33.314 --> 01:58:34.405
We can do this right?

01:58:34.547 --> 01:58:35.706
The number of random factors

01:58:35.848 --> 01:58:39.245
that actually have to coincide perfectly
in order for us to stand a chance...

01:58:42.447 --> 01:58:45.311
If it doesn't work out,
it won't be because we didn't try.

01:58:55.781 --> 01:58:56.940
Help!

01:59:05.214 --> 01:59:07.010
Help! Get me out of here.

01:59:14.747 --> 01:59:17.043
Help! Help!

01:59:26.314 --> 01:59:27.405
Help!

01:59:33.481 --> 01:59:35.140
Get me out of here.

01:59:36.180 --> 01:59:36.874
Help!

01:59:37.014 --> 01:59:37.945
Hello

01:59:38.247 --> 01:59:39.770
Please! We're trapped.

01:59:40.180 --> 01:59:41.237
Hold on...

01:59:46.047 --> 01:59:47.911
l can't, I'll be back in a second okay?

01:59:48.047 --> 01:59:49.240
No! Oh please don't leave.

01:59:49.380 --> 01:59:51.006
I'll be back. l promise.

02:00:01.814 --> 02:00:03.507
These back roads are killing us.

02:00:04.380 --> 02:00:05.471
How are we doing on time?

02:00:05.614 --> 02:00:07.204
Well we've got to
be almost halfway there.

02:00:07.347 --> 02:00:07.870
No we're not.

02:00:08.013 --> 02:00:09.741
Hey why don't you let me
drive for one minute Reggie?

02:00:09.881 --> 02:00:10.812
Yeah, I'm going to drive Don.

02:00:10.948 --> 02:00:12.436
You get to fly
the X-57 all by yourself.

02:00:12.581 --> 02:00:15.706
Just take a rest...
I'll drive for a little bit okay?

02:00:15.848 --> 02:00:18.746
We need you fresh to give the
once over the scaling device pal.

02:00:18.881 --> 02:00:20.471
Ah, don't you mean bomb?

02:00:20.614 --> 02:00:23.102
Enough, l think we're doing
pretty good right now.

02:00:23.247 --> 02:00:24.611
No, we're not -No we're not.

02:00:24.747 --> 02:00:27.838
Let Craig drive,
anybody but you, come on.

02:00:29.581 --> 02:00:31.945
Reggie, I'll take a shift.

02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:33.307
Okay, that's fine.

02:00:43.013 --> 02:00:44.979
Just try not to shoot off your foot,
tough guy.

02:00:51.247 --> 02:00:51.974
Leave those.

02:00:52.113 --> 02:00:53.807
Sorry, Gloria.
We have to take everything.

02:00:53.948 --> 02:00:54.879
Those are our orders.

02:00:55.013 --> 02:00:57.104
For God's sake, we have a child here.

02:00:57.247 --> 02:00:58.235
What if gets hungry?

02:00:58.380 --> 02:01:01.278
Then he'll come to the gym like
everyone else and get something...

02:01:01.814 --> 02:01:03.780
Do you have any other battery
devices or Cell phones?

02:01:03.914 --> 02:01:05.038
We need to conserve everything

02:01:05.180 --> 02:01:07.373
since we're not sure
how long this is will last...

02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:12.473
What about you Freddie?

02:01:12.614 --> 02:01:14.102
No. l don't have one.

02:01:14.681 --> 02:01:18.010
Food distribution is going
to be from 7 am to 9 am,

02:01:18.514 --> 02:01:20.343
and then from 2 pm to 4 pm.

02:01:21.047 --> 02:01:24.172
If anyone gets sick,
medicine is available 24 hours.

02:01:24.314 --> 02:01:28.371
Marta, Claire told me to ask
you that if you're feeling up to it,

02:01:28.514 --> 02:01:31.105
they could sure use your
help setting up the dispensary.

02:01:32.113 --> 02:01:33.238
I'll try.

02:01:43.814 --> 02:01:45.473
Daddy gave it to me.

02:01:58.848 --> 02:01:59.871
Hang in there.

02:02:14.481 --> 02:02:17.675
Go girl... My bag.

02:02:17.781 --> 02:02:18.508
No.

02:02:20.147 --> 02:02:23.136
Come to my apartment
and wait until it's over, come.

02:02:42.814 --> 02:02:45.678
Less than a hundred miles.
How you doing?

02:02:46.747 --> 02:02:47.838
I'm tired.

02:02:47.980 --> 02:02:49.742
Pull over and let me drive.

02:02:49.880 --> 02:02:50.937
I'm fine.

02:02:51.080 --> 02:02:52.546
You just said that you were tired.

02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:54.177
That's because l am tired.

02:02:54.314 --> 02:02:55.541
That's why you should let me drive.

02:02:55.681 --> 02:02:56.612
I'm fine.

02:02:56.747 --> 02:03:00.110
You still haven't learned to let
anyone help you or get close to you.

02:03:00.814 --> 02:03:01.507
Why is that?

02:03:01.647 --> 02:03:03.874
Because every time
l do l end up regretting it.

02:03:08.380 --> 02:03:10.039
I'm sorry l hurt you.

02:03:10.781 --> 02:03:12.440
That's like the punch
line to a bad joke.

02:03:12.581 --> 02:03:13.410
You left me for my best friend.

02:03:13.547 --> 02:03:15.513
l didn't leave you for Don.

02:03:16.013 --> 02:03:17.240
He was friends with both of us.

02:03:17.380 --> 02:03:18.902
We broke up,
he was there for me.

02:03:19.047 --> 02:03:20.673
That's just semantics.

02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:25.405
l don't know what you're more hurt by?

02:03:25.547 --> 02:03:28.138
Our failed marriage or
your failed friendship?

02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:29.610
Why can't it be both.

02:03:39.447 --> 02:03:39.878
Here you go.

02:03:40.013 --> 02:03:41.445
Ah...thanks.

02:03:45.481 --> 02:03:48.242
ls everyone ready to move?

02:03:48.380 --> 02:03:50.868
Yeah. How about you?

02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:52.610
Yeah...

02:03:56.347 --> 02:03:57.005
Maybe not.

02:03:57.147 --> 02:03:58.204
Are you bleeding?

02:03:59.214 --> 02:04:00.612
You should have told me.

02:04:02.947 --> 02:04:06.607
Alright come on, keep the pressure.

02:04:08.280 --> 02:04:10.939
We'll fix you up and
get you out of here.

02:04:43.913 --> 02:04:44.844
Here you go.

02:04:44.980 --> 02:04:45.708
This is it?

02:04:45.847 --> 02:04:47.643
Yes. That's breakfast for three.

02:04:47.780 --> 02:04:49.406
This wouldn't feed even one person.

02:04:49.547 --> 02:04:50.535
Mom, it's okay.

02:04:50.681 --> 02:04:52.704
No, it's not okay!

02:04:52.847 --> 02:04:53.744
It's Gloria.

02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:54.743
That woman...

02:04:54.880 --> 02:04:56.471
We didn't turn in all our food
so we can starve to death.

02:04:57.147 --> 02:04:59.579
Gloria? ls everything alright?

02:04:59.713 --> 02:05:01.680
We need more food than this.

02:05:01.813 --> 02:05:03.507
Everybody is getting the same amount.

02:05:03.647 --> 02:05:04.976
We're all in this together.

02:05:05.113 --> 02:05:06.409
No we're not.

02:05:06.847 --> 02:05:09.904
My family has suffered
more than anyone here.

02:05:10.047 --> 02:05:11.638
We've lost more than anyone.

02:05:11.780 --> 02:05:12.474
Mom, please don't.

02:05:12.614 --> 02:05:14.841
We deserve more than anyone.

02:05:14.980 --> 02:05:16.241
l know what you're doing.

02:05:16.380 --> 02:05:19.709
You're trying to use Jose's death
to get special treatment.

02:05:19.847 --> 02:05:21.938
You never loved him, we all know that.

02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:25.773
So stop this before you embarrass
your daughter and your grandson.

02:05:25.913 --> 02:05:28.243
You love this don't you?

02:05:28.913 --> 02:05:31.379
Finally, you've got all the
power you've always wanted.

02:05:31.514 --> 02:05:32.706
You think l want this job today?

02:05:32.847 --> 02:05:37.939
Well l don't! But we've got a plan
and our only hope is to stick to it.

02:05:39.247 --> 02:05:40.543
Mom!

02:05:46.113 --> 02:05:47.136
I'm so sorry.

02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:49.212
It's okay Marta, it's not your fault.

02:06:09.047 --> 02:06:10.104
What is that?

02:06:11.147 --> 02:06:12.272
Oh, sh..

02:06:35.481 --> 02:06:36.412
What the hell is this?

02:06:36.547 --> 02:06:37.739
Static electricity burst

02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:39.176
We drove right into it.

02:06:44.314 --> 02:06:45.109
Come on

02:06:45.247 --> 02:06:46.338
It's not starting?

02:06:46.481 --> 02:06:47.707
Plugs are fried.

02:06:48.713 --> 02:06:50.009
How far to Hopper?

02:06:50.147 --> 02:06:51.703
Twenty-five miles.

02:06:51.847 --> 02:06:53.313
Alright then, let's start walking.

02:07:06.180 --> 02:07:07.476
We're just going to leave it here?

02:07:08.780 --> 02:07:10.303
You can push it if you want.

02:07:19.347 --> 02:07:20.438
How are we doing on time?

02:07:20.580 --> 02:07:21.671
We're tight.

02:07:32.013 --> 02:07:33.172
There's a truck coming.

02:07:33.713 --> 02:07:35.304
My God, he's going to hit those people!

02:07:50.847 --> 02:07:53.109
Back up... taking this truck.

02:07:55.180 --> 02:07:56.271
Wait, wait

02:07:58.113 --> 02:07:58.942
Reggie!

02:08:16.013 --> 02:08:17.479
Everyone, back off!

02:08:22.180 --> 02:08:23.873
You heard her. Step away!

02:08:27.414 --> 02:08:28.243
You okay?

02:08:28.380 --> 02:08:29.606
Yeah, yeah I'm okay.

02:08:29.746 --> 02:08:32.235
Sorry, but we're going to need
to commandeer this truck.

02:08:32.380 --> 02:08:33.777
Just take it.

02:08:33.913 --> 02:08:36.243
It's almost gotten me
killed three times today.

02:08:36.380 --> 02:08:37.437
Take it.

02:08:38.646 --> 02:08:40.544
l don't think you have
the balls to shoot me.

02:08:43.214 --> 02:08:45.839
Trust me buddy, she does.

02:08:46.947 --> 02:08:49.742
Look, l need to get to my family.

02:08:50.813 --> 02:08:55.973
We're trying to save your family.
Step away.

02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:16.503
Joan, Joan.

02:09:17.113 --> 02:09:19.011
Hey. How you doing?

02:09:19.147 --> 02:09:20.204
Not great.

02:09:20.347 --> 02:09:22.279
Alright, we have to keep
moving and then we'll rest.

02:09:22.414 --> 02:09:25.380
No, l think I'll stop here.

02:09:34.047 --> 02:09:35.013
We have to keep moving.

02:09:35.147 --> 02:09:38.874
l know. l mean just me.
You all go on.

02:09:39.013 --> 02:09:40.036
No.

02:09:40.180 --> 02:09:41.543
Joan, I'm done.

02:09:42.214 --> 02:09:44.009
l got a busted rib,
a punctured lung,

02:09:44.147 --> 02:09:45.476
and a broken leg.

02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:49.734
All you're going to do by dragging me
along is endanger everyone else.

02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:51.176
I'm not leaving you here.

02:09:51.646 --> 02:09:54.612
Yes you are, and you know why?

02:09:55.780 --> 02:09:57.303
Because you're you.

02:09:58.047 --> 02:10:00.842
You've always done what it
takes to help the most people.

02:10:01.947 --> 02:10:04.072
Leaving me behind is what it takes.

02:10:11.947 --> 02:10:16.073
Alright, we'll begin to build you
some kind of shelter to protect you.

02:10:16.214 --> 02:10:21.237
After l get everyone to the mountains,

02:10:21.380 --> 02:10:24.504
I'll bring some man
and come back for you..

02:10:24.646 --> 02:10:27.078
We both know I'll be dead
before you get back.

02:10:33.847 --> 02:10:35.676
Then I'll come back and bury you.

02:10:37.947 --> 02:10:39.140
Thank you,

02:10:41.847 --> 02:10:45.836
thank you for years of grade A work,

02:10:47.813 --> 02:10:49.369
um friendship.

02:10:51.746 --> 02:10:53.939
Alan was a lucky man.

02:10:57.147 --> 02:11:00.704
Go, these people need you.

02:11:44.379 --> 02:11:47.175
Hey hey, truck coming.
Go get back up.

02:11:51.346 --> 02:11:52.471
What the hell is this?

02:11:52.613 --> 02:11:54.602
l don't know,
but we don't have time for this.

02:11:57.746 --> 02:11:59.371
We need to pass through.

02:12:00.379 --> 02:12:02.039
The town of Eden is closed.

02:12:03.113 --> 02:12:06.045
Kid, do we look like tourists?
Let us through.

02:12:06.180 --> 02:12:07.907
And l said the town's closed.

02:12:08.047 --> 02:12:09.274
Go away...

02:12:15.113 --> 02:12:16.510
What the hell.

02:12:17.513 --> 02:12:20.071
That's the sound of our
planet starting her death rattle.

02:12:20.214 --> 02:12:21.111
Are you going to let us through?

02:12:21.247 --> 02:12:24.145
No way. l got orders.

02:12:24.279 --> 02:12:25.404
Come on..

02:12:25.546 --> 02:12:27.910
Listen son,
I'm Commander Don Wincroft

02:12:28.047 --> 02:12:29.273
Never heard of it yet.

02:12:29.413 --> 02:12:30.674
Imagine that.

02:12:32.613 --> 02:12:34.045
Take it easy alright?

02:12:34.480 --> 02:12:37.537
We have an emergency situation we
need to get to Hopper Air Force base,

02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:39.305
we don't have time to
go around the town,

02:12:39.446 --> 02:12:40.469
we need to pass through here.

02:12:40.613 --> 02:12:42.079
l said l got my orders!

02:12:45.413 --> 02:12:46.504
Don!

02:12:49.214 --> 02:12:50.839
I'm sorry, please don't kill me.

02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:54.375
Let me see. You're going to be okay.

02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:56.107
Don't worry it's merely..

02:12:56.246 --> 02:12:58.076
Just don't say it's only a flesh wound

02:12:58.214 --> 02:12:59.839
l won't, but it is.

02:13:00.613 --> 02:13:02.408
ls there a medical facility in town?

02:13:02.546 --> 02:13:03.739
You're going to take us there

02:13:05.313 --> 02:13:06.609
We don't have time.

02:13:07.746 --> 02:13:09.905
You're no good to us
bleeding to death, let's go.

02:13:11.813 --> 02:13:12.836
I've got a space.

02:13:13.379 --> 02:13:14.504
Bring them over here.

02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:17.639
What happened to them?

02:13:17.780 --> 02:13:20.905
Burns. It's this weird lightning
that keeps blasting.

02:13:21.047 --> 02:13:22.569
So far it's been away
from the center of town,

02:13:22.713 --> 02:13:24.440
but if it gets closer...

02:13:25.047 --> 02:13:26.239
l shot someone.

02:13:26.379 --> 02:13:28.607
We need someone to
bandage this man up.

02:13:28.746 --> 02:13:30.678
I'm sorry, but this town is closed.

02:13:30.813 --> 02:13:31.870
Yeah, we keep hearing that.

02:13:32.013 --> 02:13:33.478
You're going to turn
away a wounded man?

02:13:33.613 --> 02:13:34.874
Somebody one of your kid's shot?

02:13:35.013 --> 02:13:36.842
Eden is under emergency lock down.

02:13:36.980 --> 02:13:38.843
The man who is bleeding
all over your floor

02:13:38.980 --> 02:13:40.502
is Commander Don Wincroft.

02:13:40.646 --> 02:13:41.942
The astronaut?

02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:47.937
Hey, feel that?

02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:49.705
Things are going to get
a whole heck of a lot worse.

02:13:49.847 --> 02:13:52.506
Shutting down your town is going to
make no difference what so ever.

02:13:52.646 --> 02:13:54.407
You're Dr. Bakus. -Yes.

02:13:54.546 --> 02:13:56.535
You're the genius
that caused this trouble.

02:13:57.413 --> 02:13:59.402
Screw this. Are those the bandages.

02:13:59.546 --> 02:14:01.409
Hey! Hey stop right there!

02:14:01.780 --> 02:14:03.007
These the bandages?

02:14:07.913 --> 02:14:08.936
Brad, don't!

02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:10.636
You want to shoot me
over a couple of bandages,

02:14:10.780 --> 02:14:11.404
you go right ahead.

02:14:11.546 --> 02:14:12.409
Hey!

02:14:13.913 --> 02:14:14.469
Nice.

02:14:14.613 --> 02:14:17.511
Seriously lady, your town sucks.

02:14:18.346 --> 02:14:22.074
Still have that left hook huh?
Does that hurt?

02:14:22.213 --> 02:14:23.679
Yeah. -Good.

02:14:26.646 --> 02:14:28.010
l seen you on television.

02:14:28.146 --> 02:14:29.113
From the spaceport.

02:14:29.246 --> 02:14:30.576
I'm Marta Hernandez.

02:14:32.246 --> 02:14:33.906
Jose Hernandez?

02:14:34.047 --> 02:14:36.137
Yeah, my husband Jose
was on the Clipper.

02:14:38.146 --> 02:14:39.339
I'm sorry.

02:14:40.313 --> 02:14:42.279
Can you guys stop what's happening?

02:14:42.413 --> 02:14:43.845
l mean, can you save us?

02:14:44.780 --> 02:14:47.405
l don't know. We're going to try.

02:14:49.113 --> 02:14:50.373
Are you an astronaut?

02:14:50.513 --> 02:14:51.706
Yes l am.

02:14:51.847 --> 02:14:53.870
My daddy was an astronaut.

02:14:54.813 --> 02:14:56.369
l know he was.

02:14:56.513 --> 02:14:59.036
Your dad was one of
the bravest men l ever met.

02:15:02.413 --> 02:15:05.073
You know what you people are
doing here shutting this town up.

02:15:05.980 --> 02:15:08.071
If we can't stop
what's happening out there,

02:15:08.713 --> 02:15:11.770
nothing you do down here
is going to save anything.

02:15:11.913 --> 02:15:15.140
We had a disaster plan
and we'll sticking to it.

02:15:15.746 --> 02:15:18.143
There's no plan for what
we're up against now...

02:15:19.246 --> 02:15:21.008
Commander, we're ready.

02:15:22.213 --> 02:15:27.339
Gotta go. Wish us luck. Thank you.

02:15:29.379 --> 02:15:30.936
Tear down the barricades.

02:15:31.780 --> 02:15:34.042
There a lot of people out
there that need our help.

02:15:34.179 --> 02:15:36.111
We've got to be here for them.

02:15:45.379 --> 02:15:48.140
It's, it's okay. We'll be safe here.

02:15:49.913 --> 02:15:51.936
Shouldn't we try to find Uncle Robert?

02:15:52.079 --> 02:15:53.978
Uncle Robert's not in his apartment,
honey.

02:15:54.112 --> 02:15:55.339
We already checked.

02:15:56.313 --> 02:15:57.472
We were supposed to go see my brother,

02:15:57.613 --> 02:15:59.841
but l think he left
the building before we came.

02:16:00.446 --> 02:16:01.343
A lot of people did.

02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:04.640
Once the lightning started people
wanted to head to lower ground so,

02:16:04.780 --> 02:16:05.939
so they left.

02:16:09.046 --> 02:16:13.172
I'm JJ Elias. Bloody hand for you.

02:16:13.313 --> 02:16:13.972
Amy.

02:16:14.112 --> 02:16:15.169
Nice to meat you Amy.

02:16:15.313 --> 02:16:16.108
This is Maya

02:16:16.246 --> 02:16:17.803
Maya, it's a pleasure.

02:16:21.713 --> 02:16:23.406
Are we going to be okay here?

02:16:23.546 --> 02:16:27.001
Yes... we will.
My apartment is completely safe.

02:16:27.847 --> 02:16:30.779
Okay. Ahhh!

02:16:35.245 --> 02:16:36.405
l have an idea.

02:16:37.913 --> 02:16:41.709
Why don't we have
an ice cream party, huh.

02:16:41.847 --> 02:16:45.779
l have a freezer and it's filled with
ice cream and if we don't eat it,

02:16:45.913 --> 02:16:48.003
it's going to melt. What do you say?

02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:52.373
Do you have chocolate?

02:16:52.780 --> 02:16:55.177
Okay, chocolate ice cream come right up.

02:16:56.780 --> 02:16:57.870
Thank you.

02:17:00.111 --> 02:17:01.510
l got England!

02:17:01.646 --> 02:17:02.339
Who?

02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:03.741
10 Downing Street.

02:17:05.646 --> 02:17:08.009
Mr. Prime Minister,
this is President Mathany.

02:17:08.146 --> 02:17:10.669
Mr. President.
What is your condition?

02:17:10.813 --> 02:17:13.142
Most, if not all of the
country is without power.

02:17:13.612 --> 02:17:17.477
We're re-establishing contact
with all branches of the military,

02:17:18.313 --> 02:17:19.609
but it's slow going.

02:17:20.346 --> 02:17:22.244
I'm afraid it's much the same.

02:17:22.379 --> 02:17:24.208
We're tracking the situation.

02:17:24.346 --> 02:17:25.903
I'm seeing the British relay stations.

02:17:26.046 --> 02:17:27.034
They're going offline.

02:17:27.179 --> 02:17:29.371
Mr. Prime Minister,
are you in a safe location?

02:17:30.379 --> 02:17:33.969
We're seeing something
happening to you're relay stations.

02:17:34.111 --> 02:17:35.702
I'm good as can be hoped for.

02:17:36.379 --> 02:17:38.038
We'll try survive the night.

02:17:38.680 --> 02:17:41.611
God bless us. God save the Queen.

02:17:43.179 --> 02:17:44.509
It's gone.

02:17:47.245 --> 02:17:48.303
You okay?

02:17:49.780 --> 02:17:51.745
Has anyone heard from
Cheryl and her team?

02:17:51.879 --> 02:17:53.277
No, Mr. President.

02:18:00.046 --> 02:18:03.943
Whoa, whoa, whoa..whoa, easy, easy

02:18:07.379 --> 02:18:09.072
I'm Commander Don Wincroft

02:18:11.245 --> 02:18:14.610
Stand down. Commander it's an honor.

02:18:14.745 --> 02:18:17.040
We got a message from the
President saying you were coming.

02:18:17.780 --> 02:18:19.143
Where's the base Commandant?

02:18:19.279 --> 02:18:21.370
Before we lost contact
with command we heard that

02:18:21.513 --> 02:18:23.741
what the earth was experiencing
was the beginning of the end.

02:18:24.413 --> 02:18:26.606
A lot of people left to
be with their families.

02:18:26.745 --> 02:18:28.644
So who's senior officer now?

02:18:28.780 --> 02:18:30.473
At the moment, that would be you sir.

02:18:31.813 --> 02:18:33.209
Open the gate.

02:18:45.612 --> 02:18:47.579
l can't believe you guys, you shameless.

02:18:48.079 --> 02:18:52.102
We made a few improvements,
leather bucket seats, MP3 player

02:18:54.313 --> 02:18:55.802
That must be the command trailer.

02:18:55.946 --> 02:18:57.776
Yeah, yeah. That's it.
Let's go check it out.

02:19:01.680 --> 02:19:02.201
Where are you going?

02:19:02.346 --> 02:19:05.312
Inside. l want to see what
a scalar bomb looks like.

02:19:17.179 --> 02:19:18.201
Jesus...

02:19:21.612 --> 02:19:24.044
the military would weaponize
a toaster if they could.

02:19:48.245 --> 02:19:49.735
Oh hell.

02:20:30.279 --> 02:20:31.869
Almost there.

02:20:46.346 --> 02:20:49.005
Wincroft, we got a problem.

02:20:49.613 --> 02:20:50.203
What?

02:20:50.346 --> 02:20:54.176
What's military protocol for detonating
any high-powered strategic device?

02:20:54.313 --> 02:20:55.336
It takes two command officers

02:20:55.480 --> 02:20:57.412
turning two separate key switches
simultaneously located

02:20:57.546 --> 02:21:00.512
more than six feet apart to... Oh hell.

02:21:01.413 --> 02:21:04.867
Yeah, it's designed so that one
person can't flip both switches.

02:21:05.012 --> 02:21:06.603
You can't do this alone buddy.

02:21:06.745 --> 02:21:08.735
Can't you rig something
so that l could do it alone?

02:21:08.879 --> 02:21:09.867
Not in the time l got.

02:21:10.012 --> 02:21:11.239
Well, you're not coming.

02:21:11.646 --> 02:21:12.975
Yeah, l am.

02:21:13.112 --> 02:21:14.941
No, l don't want you to.

02:21:15.079 --> 02:21:16.238
Yeah, me neither.

02:21:17.446 --> 02:21:19.469
I'll take somebody else,
one of the guards.

02:21:19.613 --> 02:21:21.805
Come on. They don't know the
ships systems the way l do.

02:21:22.379 --> 02:21:25.174
Besides with that arm of yours,
you can barely put your clothes on.

02:21:25.313 --> 02:21:27.972
It might be that you need someone
to actually do something a bit more

02:21:28.112 --> 02:21:29.237
than flip a switch up there.

02:21:29.379 --> 02:21:30.675
You're staying here.

02:21:30.812 --> 02:21:32.244
Why's that?

02:21:32.379 --> 02:21:34.368
So you can go out
the big hero alone again?

02:21:35.879 --> 02:21:37.845
Put NASA back on the map, eh?

02:21:38.279 --> 02:21:42.075
No, dammit! l need you here for Cheryl.

02:21:43.379 --> 02:21:44.504
Anything happens to me...

02:21:44.646 --> 02:21:46.873
you're the only person
l trust to look after her.

02:21:48.546 --> 02:21:52.603
What? Do l strike you as
someone that needs taking care of?

02:21:52.745 --> 02:21:54.836
l... -l got news for you buzz.

02:21:54.979 --> 02:21:56.104
If anything happens to you,

02:21:56.246 --> 02:21:57.678
it won't matter who
you leave to babysit me

02:21:57.812 --> 02:21:59.335
because we're all screwed.

02:21:59.779 --> 02:22:02.939
So park the testosterone
and finish suiting up!

02:22:03.012 --> 02:22:05.570
l want the crate in
the air in 5 minutes.

02:22:08.846 --> 02:22:10.937
You know on second thought,
maybe you should come along.

02:22:11.779 --> 02:22:14.371
Maybe safer than staying here,
huh? Yeah.

02:22:34.346 --> 02:22:35.709
Come on, come on.

02:22:43.112 --> 02:22:44.271
Time to say good bye.

02:22:52.379 --> 02:22:53.810
Commander? Doctor Bakus?

02:22:54.279 --> 02:22:55.074
What's up Reggie?

02:22:55.213 --> 02:22:56.042
We're losing satellites.

02:22:56.179 --> 02:22:58.304
l don't know how much
longer I'll be getting telemetry.

02:22:58.446 --> 02:22:59.503
Got it.

02:22:59.645 --> 02:23:00.668
l Gotta go.

02:23:01.679 --> 02:23:03.407
Come back soon, okay.

02:23:08.979 --> 02:23:10.672
I'm sorry for yelling.

02:23:12.846 --> 02:23:15.335
Come on, l had that coming.
l was acting like a jerk.

02:23:15.480 --> 02:23:17.309
No, l mean ever.

02:23:39.745 --> 02:23:40.608
Craig?

02:23:40.745 --> 02:23:41.733
Yeah?

02:23:42.879 --> 02:23:44.402
You want to know how you lost me?

02:23:45.946 --> 02:23:48.208
By thinking you didn't deserve me.

02:23:50.213 --> 02:23:51.872
You want to know how l let you go?

02:23:52.979 --> 02:23:54.570
Cause l knew that l didn't

02:23:56.912 --> 02:23:59.105
Do you ever get tired
of being wrong?

02:24:02.012 --> 02:24:02.444
Here.. -No...

02:24:02.579 --> 02:24:06.205
Yes, for luck.

02:24:20.513 --> 02:24:21.705
Thank you.

02:24:30.146 --> 02:24:30.611
You ready?

02:24:30.745 --> 02:24:31.768
Yeah, yeah.

02:24:48.679 --> 02:24:49.940
You okay?

02:24:50.079 --> 02:24:51.306
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:24:54.079 --> 02:24:56.102
So you and Cheryl made up, huh?

02:24:56.246 --> 02:24:57.734
Better late than never, right?

02:24:58.812 --> 02:25:00.801
So what did she have
to say for herself?

02:25:01.579 --> 02:25:02.477
Said that I'm a better lover than you

02:25:02.612 --> 02:25:05.374
and while we're away l should
probably give you a few pointers.

02:25:08.879 --> 02:25:10.606
It's going to be
a long flight this time.

02:25:10.745 --> 02:25:12.006
Hell yeah

02:25:14.545 --> 02:25:16.670
Gentlemen, you're cleared for takeoff.

02:25:16.812 --> 02:25:17.869
Good luck.

02:25:18.679 --> 02:25:19.770
Roger that.

02:25:51.979 --> 02:25:54.036
It's taking way too long to
get to fifty-thousand feet.

02:25:54.179 --> 02:25:55.270
The air is way too thin.

02:25:55.413 --> 02:25:57.708
It's making it difficult for the
ship to achieve launch altitude.

02:25:57.846 --> 02:25:58.937
We got to get to forty seven.

02:25:59.079 --> 02:26:00.102
Roger that.

02:26:06.379 --> 02:26:07.605
Forty-two thousand.

02:26:08.579 --> 02:26:10.273
Craig, if we fail to
reach launch altitude,

02:26:10.413 --> 02:26:12.242
can we still fire the nuclear
propulsion engine?

02:26:12.379 --> 02:26:14.844
Detonating a nuclear device
in this volatile atmosphere

02:26:14.979 --> 02:26:16.411
is a very bad idea.

02:26:17.545 --> 02:26:18.806
Forty-three thousand.

02:26:39.412 --> 02:26:41.140
Dammit! We're losing altitude.

02:26:41.279 --> 02:26:43.142
Forty-two thousand five hundred.

02:26:43.279 --> 02:26:45.938
Forty-two.
Craig I'm going to fire the nuke.

02:26:46.545 --> 02:26:47.841
Wait!, just give me a chance.

02:26:51.146 --> 02:26:54.010
Go... If this kills us,
I'm gonna kill you...

02:26:54.279 --> 02:26:55.302
There goes

02:27:06.779 --> 02:27:08.938
Five G's...six

02:27:09.079 --> 02:27:10.045
Hold it!

02:27:36.946 --> 02:27:39.310
X-57, this is control, can you hear me?

02:27:40.545 --> 02:27:42.102
Come in X-57

02:27:42.645 --> 02:27:43.668
Keep trying.

02:27:43.812 --> 02:27:44.402
Dr. Wincroft,

02:27:44.545 --> 02:27:46.171
just because l can't raise
them doesn't mean anything.

02:27:46.313 --> 02:27:48.540
l mean we've lost just about
every major satellite we have.

02:27:48.679 --> 02:27:49.804
l know.

02:27:55.012 --> 02:27:55.636
You okay?

02:27:55.779 --> 02:27:57.268
Yeah. You?

02:27:57.412 --> 02:27:58.776
Yeah, I'm okay.

02:27:59.579 --> 02:28:00.670
Okay, try again.

02:28:00.812 --> 02:28:01.436
Yeah.

02:28:04.545 --> 02:28:07.568
X-57, this is control can you hear me.

02:28:07.712 --> 02:28:12.008
Come in X-57. X-57, come in.

02:28:25.146 --> 02:28:26.475
It's getting worse.

02:28:27.745 --> 02:28:29.404
Yeah. Yeah it is.

02:28:31.179 --> 02:28:33.145
Before, when you said that
we were going to be safe here,

02:28:33.279 --> 02:28:34.539
you were lying, right?

02:28:34.679 --> 02:28:38.941
No, no, l was lying,
l was being optimistic.

02:28:39.079 --> 02:28:40.204
It's different.

02:28:44.345 --> 02:28:45.709
I'm sorry about your father...

02:28:47.279 --> 02:28:50.506
The picture l recognize him
from the news.

02:28:53.979 --> 02:28:55.672
You must have been
very proud of him?

02:28:59.779 --> 02:29:02.745
You know it takes a very special kind
of kid to have parents like l did.

02:29:05.112 --> 02:29:10.567
They weren't there. They were out there.

02:29:11.879 --> 02:29:13.209
Helping others...

02:29:15.879 --> 02:29:24.369
and l was getting older to live up
to that standard that selflessness.

02:29:24.512 --> 02:29:25.808
l ah...

02:29:28.645 --> 02:29:30.304
don't think l have it in me.

02:29:38.879 --> 02:29:40.106
It's okay, honey.

02:29:42.779 --> 02:29:45.836
Lie down, its nothing.
It's going to be fine.

02:29:51.012 --> 02:29:54.739
Hey, just hang in there okay?

02:29:56.378 --> 02:29:57.810
It's going to be fine.

02:30:01.779 --> 02:30:03.608
You're being optimistic again.

02:30:05.579 --> 02:30:06.840
It's all l got.

02:30:16.278 --> 02:30:20.643
Don. Hey, hey!

02:30:24.979 --> 02:30:26.205
How long have we've been out?

02:30:27.146 --> 02:30:29.135
Remember that solar shield
you were bragging about?

02:30:29.846 --> 02:30:31.368
Now would be a good time to deploy it.

02:30:34.912 --> 02:30:37.673
Dammit! it's not responding.

02:30:39.946 --> 02:30:41.139
What a shocker.

02:30:55.445 --> 02:30:56.706
Daddy?

02:30:58.046 --> 02:30:59.944
Hey, baby. How you holding up?

02:31:01.779 --> 02:31:05.404
I'm scared. How about you?

02:31:07.046 --> 02:31:09.477
Well let's not give up
on hope just yet, alright?

02:31:10.879 --> 02:31:12.367
Tom,

02:31:17.278 --> 02:31:21.472
Thomas, I'm sorry about before.

02:31:23.712 --> 02:31:26.405
l didn't realize
how hard l was taking this.

02:31:27.612 --> 02:31:29.202
That's understandable.

02:31:32.145 --> 02:31:34.839
But I'm okay now. I'm good.

02:31:41.745 --> 02:31:43.041
I'm good.

02:31:47.645 --> 02:31:49.077
Don't shoot, hold your fire.

02:31:52.579 --> 02:31:57.375
President Thomas Mathany
is no longer fit to serve.

02:31:58.846 --> 02:32:01.539
l invoke the Presidential
Succession Act

02:32:01.679 --> 02:32:03.372
and l am taking command.

02:32:04.178 --> 02:32:05.667
Roger! Stop it.

02:32:06.278 --> 02:32:10.233
That's what I've been
trying to do! Security!

02:32:10.812 --> 02:32:14.938
l order you to place
President Mathany in custody.

02:32:18.345 --> 02:32:22.141
l order you to protect
the office of the President!

02:32:22.879 --> 02:32:24.538
Put the gun down, Roger.

02:32:42.912 --> 02:32:45.377
Place the Chief of Staff
in tight security this time.

02:33:13.679 --> 02:33:15.235
l know you.

02:33:15.378 --> 02:33:18.674
You're the American that
gives me so much trouble.

02:33:19.445 --> 02:33:21.206
Salaam alaykum, agha sahib.
(peace be with you, sir)

02:33:22.412 --> 02:33:24.503
An educated trouble maker.

02:33:25.178 --> 02:33:28.076
We alaykum as-salaam, khwahar.
(And with you peace, sister.)

02:33:28.912 --> 02:33:30.309
We need your help.

02:33:32.345 --> 02:33:35.209
When Allah has decreed
that the earth burn,

02:33:35.779 --> 02:33:38.404
there is very little help l can give.

02:33:39.178 --> 02:33:41.906
My pledge is to help these
people and protect them.

02:33:43.245 --> 02:33:45.643
You had many hundreds in your camp.

02:33:45.779 --> 02:33:46.904
Where are they?

02:33:47.045 --> 02:33:49.068
They all died in the electrical storm.

02:33:49.545 --> 02:33:51.511
We're the only survivors.

02:33:51.645 --> 02:33:56.270
We need shelter,
some food and clean water.

02:33:57.679 --> 02:34:00.076
And what can you offer me in return?

02:34:00.978 --> 02:34:02.376
Nourhan.

02:34:04.545 --> 02:34:05.602
Come.

02:34:06.345 --> 02:34:08.277
My daughter did run to you.

02:34:08.412 --> 02:34:09.469
l kept her safe,

02:34:09.612 --> 02:34:14.510
and now I'm bringing her back
to be with you in this awful time.

02:34:15.212 --> 02:34:17.576
You are educated, but not wise.

02:34:17.712 --> 02:34:20.701
Nourhan has disgraced
me by running away.

02:34:20.846 --> 02:34:22.675
Disgraced her whole family.

02:34:22.812 --> 02:34:26.403
l understand that you're angry,
but you could forgive her.

02:34:26.545 --> 02:34:27.135
You could.

02:34:36.812 --> 02:34:38.710
Please help us, please.

02:34:38.846 --> 02:34:41.710
My daughter needs to be punished.

02:34:41.846 --> 02:34:43.505
l cannot allow you to do it.

02:34:44.512 --> 02:34:50.001
You won't allow me? Fine.

02:34:52.579 --> 02:34:54.306
You do it.

02:34:55.111 --> 02:34:59.237
If you avenge my family
honor for me l will give you

02:34:59.378 --> 02:35:04.276
and your people
everything you ask for.

02:35:04.412 --> 02:35:08.538
Food, water, and safety,

02:35:09.945 --> 02:35:11.536
but If you don't,

02:35:12.579 --> 02:35:16.773
I'll kill Nourhan myself and send
you all back to the desert to die.

02:35:21.579 --> 02:35:23.067
It's your choice.

02:36:02.812 --> 02:36:07.005
Nourhan, it's okay.

02:36:44.345 --> 02:36:46.936
You are much stronger than l expected.

02:37:34.445 --> 02:37:35.138
It won't deploy,

02:37:35.278 --> 02:37:37.937
circuitry must have been
damaged during the launch

02:37:38.078 --> 02:37:39.805
Looks like your improvement isn't

02:37:42.445 --> 02:37:43.933
What's the external temperature?

02:37:44.078 --> 02:37:45.976
The skin is designed to
withstand the heat of re-entry,

02:37:46.111 --> 02:37:47.441
3000 degrees Celsius.

02:37:48.111 --> 02:37:50.543
Right now we're at..
twenty-two twenty-eight.

02:37:51.111 --> 02:37:53.009
And at our current speed?

02:37:53.145 --> 02:37:57.100
If we don't get the shield open
we'll burn up in twelve minutes

02:38:10.145 --> 02:38:12.373
ls there any sort of manual
override on the shield?

02:38:12.512 --> 02:38:14.501
We did it once in the simulator.

02:38:14.645 --> 02:38:15.440
How long did it take?

02:38:15.579 --> 02:38:18.101
It took four men twenty-seven minutes.

02:38:18.645 --> 02:38:20.235
We don't have that time, we'll be dead.

02:38:24.178 --> 02:38:25.871
Okay, how about this,

02:38:26.011 --> 02:38:30.103
we flip the ship around so the
tail of the ship is facing the sun.

02:38:30.245 --> 02:38:32.870
We use the nuclear pulse shield
as our solar shield.

02:38:33.011 --> 02:38:34.568
And fly backwards?

02:38:37.145 --> 02:38:39.736
Well, your idea does have the
added benefit of being the only idea

02:38:39.878 --> 02:38:40.775
we've got right now.

02:38:40.911 --> 02:38:43.537
So, what the hell. Let's do it.

02:39:04.545 --> 02:39:05.976
We've lost the last satellite.

02:39:12.512 --> 02:39:14.000
Down to the last hours.

02:39:15.612 --> 02:39:18.805
Don and Craig will do this.
l know them.

02:39:20.111 --> 02:39:21.407
l hope so.

02:39:25.312 --> 02:39:26.300
Ready?

02:39:26.945 --> 02:39:28.377
This is going to work, right?

02:39:29.212 --> 02:39:30.473
Yeah, why not?

02:39:32.245 --> 02:39:37.473
Good enough for me.
Alright transition and go.

02:39:52.278 --> 02:39:55.039
Yeah, not too bad.

02:40:04.212 --> 02:40:06.405
Temperature is dropping, it worked.

02:40:08.078 --> 02:40:09.408
What a goal Craig.

02:40:09.545 --> 02:40:11.601
Jesus, we're not getting along are we?

02:40:18.512 --> 02:40:19.772
Mommy!

02:40:33.512 --> 02:40:34.341
Come on, honey, come on.

02:40:34.479 --> 02:40:35.308
Come on, come on.

02:40:36.512 --> 02:40:36.977
It's okay?

02:40:37.045 --> 02:40:38.511
Come, follow me.

02:40:41.512 --> 02:40:46.808
Go, go...

02:40:49.378 --> 02:40:52.139
Stop Crouch, get down here.

02:41:07.811 --> 02:41:09.300
We're almost there.
What's out time frame?

02:41:09.445 --> 02:41:10.705
Two minutes three seconds to threshold.

02:41:10.845 --> 02:41:12.640
I'm being the scalar
bomb online right now.

02:41:13.145 --> 02:41:15.202
I'll start prepping the cargo bay.

02:41:16.744 --> 02:41:18.005
Why don't you tell me,

02:41:18.611 --> 02:41:20.839
you ever feel guilty about
ending up with Cheryl?

02:41:24.345 --> 02:41:26.243
I'm not mad, just curious.

02:41:27.512 --> 02:41:29.171
Yeah, of course l felt bad.

02:41:29.845 --> 02:41:31.209
Dammit, what?

02:41:31.345 --> 02:41:32.833
l was demanding a system check,

02:41:32.978 --> 02:41:34.534
I'm going to have to override it.

02:41:37.644 --> 02:41:39.235
l guess l was mad at you too Craig.

02:41:39.378 --> 02:41:40.604
At me?

02:41:40.978 --> 02:41:43.773
Yeah, you were my friend.

02:41:43.911 --> 02:41:46.036
All l ever wanted was to see you happy.

02:41:46.678 --> 02:41:48.541
Cheryl was the best thing
that ever happened to you,

02:41:48.678 --> 02:41:49.575
and you screwed it up.

02:41:49.711 --> 02:41:50.870
You let her go.

02:41:53.278 --> 02:41:55.369
Ultimately l guess I'm glad you did.

02:41:56.678 --> 02:41:57.871
Yeah, l bet...

02:42:01.278 --> 02:42:02.641
Scalar bomb is not coming online

02:42:02.778 --> 02:42:05.336
Well l can't get the cargo
bay doors opened either

02:42:05.479 --> 02:42:06.569
If we can't get those
cargo bay doors opened,

02:42:06.711 --> 02:42:08.234
we can't eject the bomb.

02:42:08.378 --> 02:42:09.435
I'm on it.

02:42:16.011 --> 02:42:17.443
How's it look?

02:42:17.578 --> 02:42:21.510
Well I've got some bad news
and l got some really bad news...

02:42:21.644 --> 02:42:22.803
What?

02:42:22.945 --> 02:42:26.536
Looks like the heat caused
by our premature transition

02:42:26.678 --> 02:42:28.974
fused the cargo bay doors together.

02:42:31.778 --> 02:42:33.404
There not opening up again.

02:42:35.312 --> 02:42:37.141
Also the umbilical cord that

02:42:37.278 --> 02:42:40.835
connects the scalar bomb
onto the ship's systems,

02:42:41.578 --> 02:42:43.169
it's damaged.

02:42:44.378 --> 02:42:45.900
That's the bad news

02:42:48.178 --> 02:42:49.700
Can it still be detonated?

02:42:49.845 --> 02:42:53.777
Yes, but we're going to
have to do it manually.

02:42:58.678 --> 02:43:01.167
That means we're going to
have to take it in ourselves.

02:43:01.312 --> 02:43:04.301
Just detonate it by hand,

02:43:05.345 --> 02:43:07.810
which l guess you can say
is the really bad news.

02:43:10.578 --> 02:43:11.408
Well, to be honest with you,

02:43:11.544 --> 02:43:14.170
l didn't really expect to
make it back anyway.

02:43:15.611 --> 02:43:20.271
I'll start plotting our course,
and you prep the bomb.

02:43:20.811 --> 02:43:22.072
Got it.

02:43:39.178 --> 02:43:40.269
Come on.

02:43:41.312 --> 02:43:42.902
Come on, please work.

02:43:46.978 --> 02:43:50.138
Don, was one of
the improvements that

02:43:50.278 --> 02:43:52.766
you guys made turning
the cargo bay into a pod?

02:43:52.911 --> 02:43:55.399
Yeah, its hot-swappable.

02:43:55.544 --> 02:43:58.340
There were plans for a medical
or a passenger pod.

02:43:58.478 --> 02:44:00.467
So you can jettison it?

02:44:00.611 --> 02:44:01.599
Yes!

02:44:01.744 --> 02:44:04.539
Okay. Change of plan.

02:44:05.345 --> 02:44:08.367
Your going to fly the ship into
the sun as close as you can make it

02:44:08.511 --> 02:44:10.034
without it burning up,

02:44:10.178 --> 02:44:13.507
and you just jettison the pod
and get the hell out of Dodge.

02:44:14.145 --> 02:44:16.111
The sun's gravity is going to
pull the bomb right in.

02:44:16.245 --> 02:44:18.472
l thought the bomb had
to be detonated manually?

02:44:18.611 --> 02:44:20.406
Yeah, it does. I'll do it.

02:44:20.978 --> 02:44:22.500
Like hell you will.

02:44:23.145 --> 02:44:24.804
You don't know how to do this Don.

02:44:24.945 --> 02:44:26.410
You show me how.

02:44:26.544 --> 02:44:28.272
Don, l don't know how to fly this ship.

02:44:28.411 --> 02:44:30.037
Just go home to Cheryl.

02:44:30.178 --> 02:44:31.939
There's got to be another way Craig.

02:44:32.078 --> 02:44:34.339
There's forty seconds to threshold

02:44:34.911 --> 02:44:38.071
Even the great Don Wincroft can't
come up with a plan that fast.

02:44:38.212 --> 02:44:39.541
But you could.

02:44:40.111 --> 02:44:41.633
This is all we've got.

02:44:42.212 --> 02:44:43.472
We've got to do this.

02:44:45.377 --> 02:44:47.105
Craig don't.

02:44:50.212 --> 02:44:51.541
Craig dammit!

02:45:01.611 --> 02:45:03.600
Why the hell did you do that Craig?

02:45:03.744 --> 02:45:05.642
You would have never
let me stay behind.

02:45:06.911 --> 02:45:10.900
We both know that was the
only way...thirty seconds.

02:45:11.045 --> 02:45:15.137
Get the hell out of here!
You better listen to me now,

02:45:15.278 --> 02:45:18.244
in my flight bag there's something
l want you to give to Cheryl

02:45:18.744 --> 02:45:20.300
You're going to recognize
it the second you see it.

02:45:20.444 --> 02:45:23.070
Trust me... twenty seconds.

02:45:24.578 --> 02:45:26.169
So much for long goodbyes, huh?

02:45:27.845 --> 02:45:34.039
Ten. Don you there? Don!?

02:45:34.178 --> 02:45:35.768
Yeah, I'm still here.

02:45:36.611 --> 02:45:38.202
Glad we were friends, buddy.

02:45:39.811 --> 02:45:41.674
Just wish l would
have been a better one.

02:45:43.311 --> 02:45:45.107
You did just fine.

02:46:27.778 --> 02:46:29.710
They should have
detonated the device by now.

02:46:30.544 --> 02:46:31.908
How long until we know?

02:46:32.045 --> 02:46:33.271
Better be soon.

02:46:35.778 --> 02:46:38.040
It'll be okay. Just hang tight

02:47:56.945 --> 02:47:58.002
Listen.

02:47:58.778 --> 02:48:00.141
l don't hear anything.

02:48:01.678 --> 02:48:02.905
Neither do l.

02:48:03.978 --> 02:48:05.001
Come on!

02:48:18.211 --> 02:48:20.302
Oh my God, they did it.

02:48:21.644 --> 02:48:22.940
l knew they would.

02:48:55.845 --> 02:48:57.310
Oh man.

02:49:15.344 --> 02:49:16.674
ls it over?

02:49:19.045 --> 02:49:20.510
l think so.

02:49:24.544 --> 02:49:25.908
We'll be okay.

02:49:49.945 --> 02:49:52.069
l want communications restored asap.

02:49:52.544 --> 02:49:54.169
l want the country to know
that we are not alone.

02:49:54.311 --> 02:49:56.903
l want the world to know
that we got through this together

02:49:57.044 --> 02:49:58.510
Yes sir, Mr. President

02:50:03.544 --> 02:50:05.100
Mom would be proud of you.

02:50:05.744 --> 02:50:07.437
Mom would be proud of both of us.

02:50:30.010 --> 02:50:33.306
Dr. Wincroft, I'm scanning
all the frequencies l can,

02:50:33.444 --> 02:50:35.467
but there's no news from the X-57

02:50:36.311 --> 02:50:38.004
It's okay, Reggie. You can stop.

02:50:38.144 --> 02:50:39.804
Yeah, don't give up hope.

02:50:40.578 --> 02:50:44.510
No, l mean you can stop
because there they are...C'mon!

02:50:52.311 --> 02:50:54.539
Sergeant, we need your help.

02:50:59.478 --> 02:51:00.671
Come on, come on, come on!

02:51:00.811 --> 02:51:01.936
Go! Lets go!

02:51:28.678 --> 02:51:30.143
Craig?

02:51:36.611 --> 02:51:40.065
He saved us all.
You should know that...

02:51:42.077 --> 02:51:44.100
He wanted you to have this again.
