WEBVTT

00:09.127 --> 00:12.278
FRASIER: I'm glad you came back
with us. I hope you had a good time.

00:12.447 --> 00:14.915
Well, I can't tell you how much
fun this has been.

00:15.087 --> 00:17.840
Listen, now that you know the way,
don't be a stranger, okay?

00:18.007 --> 00:19.599
Good night.

00:20.167 --> 00:21.759
Who the hell was that?

00:22.407 --> 00:24.682
- He's not from the station?
- I never saw him before.

00:24.887 --> 00:27.242
He was table-hopping like crazy
during the awards.

00:27.447 --> 00:29.483
That's because he was our waiter.

00:32.406 --> 00:35.205
Well, that's the last time I say,
"Everybody back to my place."

00:36.287 --> 00:39.279
BULLDOG: Oh, who cares
about that guy? This is a great night.

00:39.447 --> 00:41.597
For you, maybe.
The rest of us lost.

00:41.807 --> 00:44.241
Hey, it's not important
whether you win or lose.

00:44.407 --> 00:45.806
It's an honour just being nomi...

00:45.967 --> 00:47.559
[LAUGHING]

00:47.847 --> 00:50.998
I couldn't get through that crap
on stage. I can't get through it now.

00:52.607 --> 00:54.882
- Do you mind if I use your phone?
FRASIER: No, not at all.

00:55.087 --> 00:56.440
Who are you calling?
It's midnight.

00:56.647 --> 00:59.605
I promised my grandmother I'd leave
her a message telling her how we did.

01:00.087 --> 01:04.239
Hey, Gammy, it's Roz. Guess what?
I won again. We're all here celebrating.

01:05.167 --> 01:06.805
ALL:
Yay.

01:07.007 --> 01:08.520
ROZ:
Listen, I gotta go.

01:08.727 --> 01:11.480
It's getting crazy here,
but I'll talk to you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

01:11.687 --> 01:14.360
You lied to Gammy?

01:15.607 --> 01:17.996
Well, she's old,
and it makes her happy.

01:18.167 --> 01:20.681
She smiled for a week when I won
the Miss Seattle pageant.

01:24.007 --> 01:26.965
You know, Roz raises a very
interesting philosophical question.

01:27.167 --> 01:29.635
Here we go. Buckle up.

01:30.807 --> 01:33.605
Is it always morally wrong to lie?

01:33.807 --> 01:35.399
Now, we are taught that it is.

01:35.887 --> 01:39.084
But are there certain occasions
where a lie would be acceptable?

01:39.287 --> 01:41.676
Yeah, like the lies
you tell a chick in bed.

01:42.127 --> 01:46.325
"You're the best I've ever been with."
"Your thighs don't look that fat."

01:48.207 --> 01:50.038
"Don't worry, I've had a vasectomy."

01:52.367 --> 01:56.280
Hey, screw you guys! I'm an artist.
We live by different rules.

01:57.647 --> 02:00.207
An argument can certainly be
made that a lie is good

02:00.367 --> 02:02.244
when it spares someone
unnecessary pain.

02:02.407 --> 02:06.082
I'm reminded of Maris' brief flirtation
with active wear when I assured her,

02:06.527 --> 02:10.725
"You look fine, darling,
spandex is supposed to blouse."

02:15.767 --> 02:17.962
You know, Lilith actually told me
the other day that

02:18.127 --> 02:19.765
Frederick has taken to lying.

02:21.047 --> 02:23.925
Yes, he told all of his friends
that Lilith is an alien.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.917
It seems as good an explanation
as any.

02:28.847 --> 02:31.236
Yes, he also told them that she wears
her hair in a bun

02:31.407 --> 02:33.523
to hide the third eye
in the back of her head.

02:33.727 --> 02:35.683
- How did Lilith find out?
FRASIER: Well,

02:35.887 --> 02:38.401
apparently, she was driving him
and two of his friends over

02:38.567 --> 02:39.920
to a Junior Mensa meeting.

02:40.087 --> 02:41.406
She looked in the rear-view mirror

02:41.567 --> 02:44.127
and saw that they were
making faces at the other cars.

02:44.287 --> 02:46.323
So never have the words
"I can see you"

02:46.527 --> 02:49.325
caused so much screaming
and wetting of pants.

02:49.527 --> 02:50.676
[LAUGHING]

02:52.887 --> 02:55.196
I did my share of fibbing too.

02:55.367 --> 02:58.598
I once told my school chums
I was born with a tiny embryonic twin

02:58.767 --> 03:00.325
attached to my hip.

03:02.567 --> 03:06.276
Of course, they were horrified,
and it didn't help my social life at all.

03:06.447 --> 03:10.406
Oh, but for a while there
it was nice having a sister.

03:18.007 --> 03:20.396
Oh, remember in prep school
when we were so desperate

03:20.567 --> 03:22.603
to avoid the President's
Physical Fitness Test...

03:22.807 --> 03:24.604
That we lit a match underneath
the fire alarm,

03:24.767 --> 03:28.043
- and all the sprinklers went off.
- And we blamed that delinquent kid,

03:28.207 --> 03:30.277
- John Rajeski.
- Yes.

03:30.447 --> 03:32.483
- You did what?
- What's wrong?

03:32.687 --> 03:35.485
You two swore up and down to me
that you never set off that alarm.

03:35.687 --> 03:37.882
Well, of course, we weren't gonna
tell you.

03:38.527 --> 03:40.404
NILES: For heaven's sake, Dad,
you can't be mad.

03:40.607 --> 03:41.756
We were kids.

03:41.967 --> 03:43.719
You know, the headmaster said
it was you two.

03:43.887 --> 03:46.640
I went there and raised hell with him.
I said, "My kids don't lie."

03:46.807 --> 03:49.560
Because of you, that Rajeski kid
got expelled.

03:50.167 --> 03:51.919
Expelled?

03:52.567 --> 03:54.319
Jeez, if we'd known that was
gonna happen,

03:54.487 --> 03:56.637
- we would've told the truth.
- Not me.

03:57.687 --> 04:00.406
He was a brute and a meanie.

04:02.007 --> 04:03.565
FRASIER:
You're right.

04:03.767 --> 04:05.758
He used to make the
most merciless fun of me

04:05.927 --> 04:08.680
because I always wore
my gym shorts in the shower.

04:11.167 --> 04:14.477
He used to call me
shorts-in-the-shower boy.

04:16.447 --> 04:18.517
Well, you don't have to be witty
to be cruel.

04:19.966 --> 04:23.243
I don't give a damn what that kid did.
Getting him expelled was worse.

04:23.447 --> 04:25.199
I'm going to bed.
Good night, everybody.

04:25.727 --> 04:28.241
- Good night.
FRASIER: Good night, Dad.

04:28.687 --> 04:31.599
Well, I guess that brings an end
to our little debate.

04:31.767 --> 04:33.758
Apparently, there are no good lies.

04:33.967 --> 04:36.197
Hey, hey, it's getting
kind of heavy in here.

04:36.367 --> 04:38.642
We gotta liven this place up, huh?

04:38.807 --> 04:40.798
Hey, I know. Party games, huh?

04:41.007 --> 04:43.396
All right, doc, I'm gonna need

04:43.607 --> 04:46.440
a blindfold, some whipped cream
and a glass coffee table.

04:48.407 --> 04:50.443
What? Nobody here went to camp?

04:52.167 --> 04:56.240
- Forget it.
- Hold on. These guys are no fun.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.402
You know what? I know a great
after-hours place

04:59.567 --> 05:01.319
where we can go get a few drinks.

05:01.527 --> 05:03.677
Now you're talking.

05:03.847 --> 05:04.962
Hey, if things go well,

05:05.127 --> 05:06.719
I know an after-after-hours place.

05:06.927 --> 05:11.079
- I got the keys.
- You get the elevator, I'll get my coat.

05:11.287 --> 05:12.879
You're on.

05:18.247 --> 05:20.317
No good lies, my ass.

05:26.247 --> 05:28.966
NILES: Good morning, Frasier.
- Oh, good morning, Niles.

05:30.367 --> 05:32.676
Oh, dear God, it's finally happened.

05:32.847 --> 05:33.916
This is the thanks I get

05:34.087 --> 05:35.998
for introducing you
to my personal shopper.

05:36.287 --> 05:38.005
I gave Rinaldo instructions
to write down

05:38.167 --> 05:39.759
every article of clothing I've purchased

05:39.927 --> 05:41.485
so we could avoid
this sort of calamity.

05:41.687 --> 05:42.961
I didn't use Rinaldo.

05:43.127 --> 05:46.324
This suit just caught my eye
while I was shopping for shoes.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.075
Oh!

05:50.567 --> 05:51.761
Well, why didn't you also take

05:51.927 --> 05:54.202
- my strong chin and swimmer's build?
FRASIER: Oh, please.

05:56.127 --> 05:59.039
- Obviously, we have to sit apart today.
- Oh, sit down!

06:00.607 --> 06:02.563
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

06:02.807 --> 06:05.401
Most people aren't as attuned
to these things as you and I are.

06:05.567 --> 06:07.285
I'm sure they won't even notice.

06:07.487 --> 06:08.476
Here, double espresso.

06:08.647 --> 06:11.764
I took a chance and brought you
the same thing.

06:15.967 --> 06:17.286
FRASIER:
Well, anyway,

06:17.887 --> 06:20.560
after our conversation last night,
I couldn't stop thinking

06:20.727 --> 06:22.558
about our getting
John Rajeski expelled.

06:22.727 --> 06:25.366
- I didn't sleep a wink.
- You can't be serious.

06:25.967 --> 06:28.276
You mean, it didn't bother you?
Where is your conscience?

06:28.487 --> 06:31.445
Perhaps it fell into the quad
along with my hall monitor beret

06:31.607 --> 06:34.246
when John hung me from the flagpole.

06:37.167 --> 06:38.839
He was going to be expelled
sooner or later.

06:39.007 --> 06:40.838
You cannot guilt me into feeling bad.

06:41.047 --> 06:43.163
Yes, well, no one hated him
more than I did,

06:43.327 --> 06:44.965
but I still think we owe him an apology.

06:45.567 --> 06:49.355
- May I borrow your phone, Niles?
- Certainly. There you are.

06:49.527 --> 06:50.642
You're not going to call him.

06:50.847 --> 06:53.122
- I am.
- Are you insane?

06:53.287 --> 06:55.164
Hello, a number for a John Rajeski,
please.

06:55.327 --> 06:58.842
Niles, my conscience won't rest until
the two of us have said we're sorry.

06:59.247 --> 07:01.078
Oh, yes, connect me, please.

07:01.247 --> 07:03.283
Leave me out of this. I'm not sorry.

07:03.447 --> 07:04.880
But don't tell him that.

07:06.767 --> 07:10.203
And if he asks, I'm living in Italy.

07:10.367 --> 07:12.642
No, no, France.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.923
No, Italy.

07:15.687 --> 07:16.802
Yes, hello.

07:16.967 --> 07:20.403
Is John Rajeski there, please?
It's an old friend of his.

07:21.527 --> 07:22.562
Oh.

07:23.127 --> 07:26.164
I'm terribly sorry to hear that.
Thank you.

07:27.567 --> 07:29.558
Niles, it's worse than we thought.

07:29.807 --> 07:31.638
He's in prison.

07:32.767 --> 07:36.521
Well, who's wearing shorts
in the shower now?

07:44.567 --> 07:45.886
Yes, well, joke all you like.

07:46.087 --> 07:48.396
I still can't help thinking
this is all our fault.

07:48.567 --> 07:50.683
- How?
- Well, he was always on the cusp.

07:51.327 --> 07:54.239
Maybe he couldn't get in another prep
school. Maybe he had to go to public.

07:55.447 --> 07:56.641
Fell in with the wrong crowd,

07:56.807 --> 07:59.002
couldn't hold down a job,
he turned to a life of crime.

07:59.207 --> 08:01.482
Frasier, sometimes bad things
happen to bad people.

08:01.647 --> 08:04.036
We did not set him
on the path to prison.

08:04.247 --> 08:07.239
Until I'm sure, my conscience will
not rest. I have got to speak with him.

08:07.447 --> 08:08.482
May I have the check?

08:08.647 --> 08:10.046
You're not going down
to the jail.

08:10.247 --> 08:13.080
Yes, I am.
I invite you to join me.

08:13.287 --> 08:15.198
Oh, yes, that's a good idea, Frasier.

08:15.367 --> 08:18.598
The Crane boys going to a prison
in matching outfits.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:31.487 --> 08:33.318
- Frasier Crane?
- John.

08:33.527 --> 08:35.245
Hey, how's it going?

08:35.447 --> 08:37.164
Well, fine. And you?

08:37.567 --> 08:38.885
Eh.

08:41.527 --> 08:43.563
- What brings you down here?
- Well,

08:43.767 --> 08:46.725
I don't know if you get
the alumni magazine, but

08:47.167 --> 08:49.965
- No.
- I became a psychiatrist,

08:50.167 --> 08:53.762
and I'm currently conducting
a study on men behind bars

08:53.927 --> 08:59.206
and how they got there. That's an
awfully nasty bruise on your knuckles.

08:59.367 --> 09:03.246
Oh, this... Caught some guy
using my comb.

09:03.407 --> 09:05.602
I really hate it when people
touch my stuff.

09:06.167 --> 09:09.682
Oh, yes, I remember my brother Niles
once sat in your chair in the cafeteria.

09:09.887 --> 09:13.004
As I recall, you put him on a tray
and ran him through the dishwasher.

09:13.207 --> 09:14.196
[LAUGHING]

09:14.367 --> 09:17.165
Yeah, class clown, that was me.

09:18.487 --> 09:20.045
Yeah, how is Niles anyway?

09:20.247 --> 09:22.920
He's... He's abroad now.

09:23.127 --> 09:24.685
Really?

09:26.967 --> 09:29.435
- Whoa, that must have hurt.
- No, no, I mean...

09:29.847 --> 09:32.486
Well, yes, I suppose it did.

09:33.287 --> 09:35.755
Anyway, it would be an enormous
help in my study if you could

09:35.967 --> 09:40.597
perhaps pinpoint the moment
or event in your life

09:40.767 --> 09:43.440
that led you to here.

09:43.647 --> 09:44.796
Oh, that's easy.

09:44.967 --> 09:47.037
I'm doing time for
passing a bad check.

09:47.847 --> 09:50.520
Yeah, you see, I wanted
to get my wife something nice.

09:50.727 --> 09:53.116
Been going through
a rough time recently.

09:53.327 --> 09:54.999
I was scared she was gonna leave me.

09:55.207 --> 09:56.356
That was quick and painless.

09:56.527 --> 09:58.438
We identified the point
where you fell off the beam.

09:58.607 --> 10:00.962
Actually, though,
I was already on probation.

10:01.127 --> 10:02.606
I did some time about ten years back

10:02.767 --> 10:04.644
for driving a car
that didn't belong to me.

10:04.847 --> 10:07.202
And that was your first infraction.

10:07.407 --> 10:08.840
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, then,

10:09.007 --> 10:10.486
case closed, mystery solved.

10:10.647 --> 10:13.241
Young man yields to the lure
of a bright and shiny car.

10:13.647 --> 10:16.445
- Is there anything more tragic?
- I did have a juvenile record.

10:16.607 --> 10:18.438
Apparently, there is.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.522
Got thrown out of high school
for fighting.

10:22.247 --> 10:24.807
You did say high school,
not prep school?

10:25.007 --> 10:28.044
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
This was way after you knew me.

10:28.247 --> 10:30.397
I went bad then.

10:30.607 --> 10:32.598
Always getting into fights.

10:32.767 --> 10:35.042
Of course, I wouldn't have been there
in the first place

10:35.207 --> 10:38.517
if I hadn't got thrown out of
that good school you and me were in.

10:40.167 --> 10:41.680
That had a big effect on me,
you know?

10:41.887 --> 10:44.162
Yes, well, perhaps we could
continue our backward journey...

10:44.327 --> 10:46.636
No, no, no, that was a bum rap.

10:47.167 --> 10:49.283
Somebody pulled the fire alarm.

10:49.487 --> 10:51.842
They blamed me for it.
They said I did it. I didn't do it.

10:52.047 --> 10:54.003
- Let's discuss your early childhood.
- You know,

10:54.207 --> 10:55.765
the more I think about it,

10:55.967 --> 10:58.242
this all started the day
I got thrown out of prep school.

10:58.447 --> 11:00.199
Ever since then, my life's been crap.

11:00.407 --> 11:01.396
Crap!

11:01.567 --> 11:04.001
You know, I think I have all
the information I need now.

one more thing.

There's something I need
to tell you about.

Something I did in school
I'm not very proud of.

Beat it.

So, what'd you do?

11:41.647 --> 11:45.356
Well, I peeked over your shoulder once
during an algebra quiz.

12:01.967 --> 12:03.320
Is something wrong with your back?

12:03.487 --> 12:05.205
I injured it this morning

12:05.367 --> 12:06.402
playing squash.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.800
I had to make a dive
to save match point.

You're too kind.

I should never have even
attempted a move like that.

12:19.367 --> 12:23.042
It was sort of a cross between
a pirouette and a flying-scissor kick.

in your Mercedes again?
