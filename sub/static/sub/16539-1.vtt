00:59.769 --> 01:02.879

02:07.581 --> 02:10.047

02:29.182 --> 02:35.140
- Governor, we are not, not, not
going to be explaining.

02:35.167 --> 02:37.153
When we're explaining,
we're losing.

02:38.399 --> 02:40.004
Now, we'll protect you
from this bullshit.

02:40.031 --> 02:42.017
We will attack, attack,
and attack again.

02:42.047 --> 02:43.073
<i>- This is Paul Turner,</i>

02:43.104 --> 02:44.642
<i>former presidential aide</i>

02:44.672 --> 02:46.309
<i>and the guy
for politicians in trouble.</i>

02:46.336 --> 02:48.714
<i>He's called
"the master of disaster. "</i>

02:48.735 --> 02:49.892
- But I need Sophia
by your side.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.491
- I've got the, uh,
Vermont gov calling in.

02:51.520 --> 02:54.247
<i>And this is me,
Kerstin Rhee, his assistant.</i>

02:54.272 --> 02:55.746
<i>learned more
in my first week with Paul</i>

02:55.776 --> 02:57.446
<i>on how it all really Works</i>

02:57.472 --> 02:59.589
<i>than in four years
of college.</i>

02:59.617 --> 03:00.773
- All right.
Okay.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.306
I'll call you later.
You-don't worry.

03:02.337 --> 03:03.558
Just-just don't.

03:03.584 --> 03:04.938
- Thank you.

03:04.961 --> 03:05.921
- Hey, listen.

03:05.952 --> 03:07.174
- I didn't have much.

03:07.201 --> 03:09.253
Absent father,

03:09.281 --> 03:11.530
mother with two low-paying jobs,

03:11.553 --> 03:15.111
and my sister Mary,
my big sister,

03:15.138 --> 03:17.516
who always dreamed
of becoming a doctor.

03:17.537 --> 03:19.491
But, as hard
as my mother worked

03:19.522 --> 03:20.995
she couldn't keep up
the payments

03:21.026 --> 03:22.215
on our little house.

03:22.242 --> 03:25.417
And one day, the bank came
and foreclosed on us.

03:25.442 --> 03:28.236
<i>- Larry Becker
was born to run for office.</i>

03:28.258 --> 03:29.961
<i>He's taken on
the Wall Street banks,</i>

03:29.986 --> 03:32.136
<i>Who, in return, have declared
jihad against him.</i>

03:32.163 --> 03:34.378
<i>And he's in a bare-knuckled
reelection campaign</i>

03:34.402 --> 03:36.999
<i>against a crazy
ex-baseball player</i>

03:37.026 --> 03:39.689
- First we moved
into a homeless shelter,

03:39.715 --> 03:41.668
but that wasn't safe.

03:41.699 --> 03:44.678
Eventually we found
a tiny one-bedroom apartment-

03:44.707 --> 03:46.344
three of us.

03:46.371 --> 03:48.204
- The press will most likely
have questions about

03:48.228 --> 03:50.443
Afghan troop levels,
the Travis base closing,

03:50.467 --> 03:51.853
levies, the budget debates.

03:51.876 --> 03:53.349
Just blow through
those questions

03:53.380 --> 03:55.300
and pivot to our message
of the day.

03:55.332 --> 03:56.521
- All right, great.

03:56.548 --> 03:59.407
Got it.
Thank you, guys.

03:59.428 --> 04:00.847
Ah.

04:00.869 --> 04:02.025
All right.
Showtime.

04:02.052 --> 04:03.972
<i>- Stephen Green
is the real deal."</i>

04:04.005 --> 04:06.438
<i>war hero, cares,
actually knows the facts.</i>

04:06.469 --> 04:07.723
<i>And he's cruising
for reelection</i>

04:07.748 --> 04:08.741
<i>against Duff Campbell,</i>

04:08.773 --> 04:10.093
<i>who has none
of those things,</i>

04:10.117 --> 04:12.550
<i>but Duff does have good hair
and unlimited money,</i>

04:12.581 --> 04:14.381
<i>which is the mother's milk
of all politics.</i>

04:15.141 --> 04:17.127
- My mama struggled
day and night,

04:17.156 --> 04:18.598
but it wasn't enough.

04:18.629 --> 04:20.233
Eventually, my sister Mary,

04:20.262 --> 04:23.502
she had to quit high school,
get a job as a waitress.

04:23.526 --> 04:25.031
Both of them working
just to provide me

04:25.062 --> 04:27.976
with some food, clothing,
roof over my head.

04:28.006 --> 04:29.392
- What do you say
to Campbell's charge

04:29.414 --> 04:30.374
that you're afraid
to debate him?

04:30.406 --> 04:31.563
- What is the air force
gonna do about the Travis Base?

04:31.591 --> 04:32.551
- As a former Navy SEAL,

04:32.582 --> 04:34.317
what do you think about the way
they handled it?

04:34.342 --> 04:35.369
- Gas prices
are at a record high.

04:35.398 --> 04:36.424
Companies are making
enormous profits.

04:36.454 --> 04:37.578
What's your response?

04:37.607 --> 04:39.113
- Okay, guys,
these are great questions.

04:39.143 --> 04:40.267
I'm gonna get to all these,

04:40.294 --> 04:41.899
But my primary purpose
here today is to talk

04:41.927 --> 04:43.531
about our most precious
natural resource,

04:43.559 --> 04:44.749
which is our children.

04:44.775 --> 04:47.275
We now live in a country
where over 2/3 of the population

04:47.304 --> 04:48.493
is overweight.

04:48.520 --> 04:50.604
Now, 90%
of our middle schools

04:50.632 --> 04:53.359
no longer have
daily gym classes.

04:53.383 --> 04:55.467
- At night, I'd hear my mama
come home

04:55.495 --> 04:58.190
from her late shift
at the tanning plant.

04:58.216 --> 05:00.464
As I lay there in bed...

05:02.792 --> 05:06.731
I could hear my mama cry.

05:06.761 --> 05:08.747
And I ask you,

05:08.777 --> 05:11.636
how is it possible

05:11.657 --> 05:13.873
that a country that can afford

05:13.897 --> 05:15.468
to bail out
the Wall Street banks

05:15.497 --> 05:18.160
to the tune
of over $2 trillion-

05:18.185 --> 05:19.658
trillion-

05:19.690 --> 05:21.708
how could that country
not afford to have

05:21.737 --> 05:22.927
those same banks

05:22.953 --> 05:24.786
from taking away
the American dream

05:24.809 --> 05:27.155
from so many
hardworking Americans?

05:27.177 --> 05:29.044
It's just not right.

05:29.066 --> 05:30.452
- This is a crisis.

05:30.474 --> 05:33.584
And it's a crisis that we owe it
to our children to solve.

05:33.610 --> 05:35.378
And the time to solve it is now.

05:35.403 --> 05:36.363
Thank you.

05:37.771 --> 05:40.149
- Just a couple more questions
on Afghan troop levels, Senator.

05:40.170 --> 05:41.425
- Hey, Reed?
Hey.

05:41.451 --> 05:43.535
Why don't you go fishing
for the three-day weekend?

05:43.563 --> 05:46.127
We'll dump the divorce news
after 5:00 on Friday

05:46.155 --> 05:47.247
by tipping the AP

05:47.275 --> 05:49.142
to the legal filings
on an embargoed basis.

05:49.163 --> 05:51.476
They'll play on the wires
after 7:00.

05:51.499 --> 05:53.104
It's the perfect time
for a document dump.

05:53.132 --> 05:55.827
All right.
Talk to you later.

05:57.547 --> 05:58.802
He'll live.

06:04.332 --> 06:06.002
- All right!

06:06.029 --> 06:06.989
- Ka-ching.

06:07.020 --> 06:08.755
Money shot.
The message of the day.

06:08.780 --> 06:10.613
- This one's yours, all right?

06:10.636 --> 06:12.622
Oh, God!

06:12.653 --> 06:14.290
- Sir, are you okay?

06:14.317 --> 06:16.369
- Yeah, I'm all right.
Thanks. Thanks.

06:16.397 --> 06:18.929
All right!
Come on!

06:22.573 --> 06:24.440
- Same thing?

06:24.462 --> 06:26.481
- Yes.
Yes.

06:28.366 --> 06:31.727
- Now, as I stand here
in the governor's house-

06:31.758 --> 06:33.263
the people's house,

06:33.294 --> 06:36.655
I am using the power
of this house

06:36.686 --> 06:39.186
to help keep
the people of Kentucky

06:39.215 --> 06:41.081
in their houses.

06:41.102 --> 06:43.961
Today I am sending a bill
to the state senate

06:43.982 --> 06:46.743
that offers real
and solid protection

06:46.767 --> 06:48.687
from the kind of
cruel foreclosures

06:48.719 --> 06:51.666
that my mama and so many
hardworking Kentuckians

06:51.695 --> 06:55.001
have been forced to endure.

06:55.023 --> 06:58.548
And I'm asking for you
to back me on this.

06:58.576 --> 07:02.265
It's-it's fair, it's decent,

07:02.288 --> 07:04.154
and it is right.

07:12.048 --> 07:13.303
You don't have to do that.

07:13.329 --> 07:14.551
You're an aide,
not a waitress.

07:14.577 --> 07:17.523
- It's my pleasure.

07:17.553 --> 07:20.696
And can I ask you something?

07:20.721 --> 07:21.877
- Of course.

07:21.905 --> 07:25.332
- How much of that story
you just told is true?

07:26.418 --> 07:29.179
- Helena.

07:29.202 --> 07:31.385
100%.

07:31.410 --> 07:33.330
- Really?

07:35.666 --> 07:37.653
- Come here.

07:54.772 --> 07:55.764
- Room 1600?

07:55.795 --> 07:57.301
- You're Tawny?

07:57.332 --> 07:58.620
- To the rescue.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.379
1600'?

08:00.404 --> 08:02.204
- Down the hall
to your left.

08:04.724 --> 08:06.263
Hey, could you be
a bit more obvious?

08:06.292 --> 08:07.995
- I thought
he was getting a masseuse,

08:08.020 --> 08:10.071
not some starlet
playing a masseuse.

08:10.100 --> 08:12.152
- Hey, she and her company
were vetted.

08:12.180 --> 08:13.599
She had the recs.
- Yeah.

08:13.621 --> 08:15.672
She has the killer bod.
That's the only rec that counts.

08:15.700 --> 08:19.028
You know, come to think of it,
my back feels stiff too.

08:19.061 --> 08:21.593
- Yeah, that's not
the only thing, you jerk.

08:23.637 --> 08:24.891
- Nice.

08:27.062 --> 08:28.928
- In Kentucky,
we're going to the mattresses.

08:28.949 --> 08:30.652
- I've got some ideas
on the statement.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.957
- Well, they better be good,
'cause if he goes down,

08:32.981 --> 08:34.552
it's gonna be
a four-day school week there.

08:34.582 --> 08:37.441
Minimum wage will drop
to 75¢ an hour.

08:37.462 --> 08:39.645
You'll be able to light
the Kentucky rivers on fire.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.394
- How late are we?

08:42.423 --> 08:44.507
- Real time or Paul time?

08:44.535 --> 08:46.913
Exactly on time.
How do you know this person?

08:46.934 --> 08:49.280
- She's my law school
roommate's sister.

08:49.302 --> 08:50.623
But the object is
to get in, get out,

08:50.647 --> 08:52.382
and get back
to the Kentucky mess.

08:52.407 --> 08:55.321
- Max!
Julia!

08:55.351 --> 08:56.857
- Yes?

08:56.887 --> 08:58.524
- Get me Paul.

08:58.551 --> 08:59.642
Get him now.

09:01.976 --> 09:04.541
- Senator, let's just
go through this bit-by-bit.

09:04.567 --> 09:05.724
What are we
talking about here?

09:05.752 --> 09:07.454
- She's claiming
that we did it.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.117
- Well, did What'?

09:09.144 --> 09:10.977
A happy ending, OI'-

09:11.000 --> 09:12.419
- More.

09:12.440 --> 09:14.721
I'm sure she thinks
it'll get her a bigger check.

09:14.745 --> 09:17.277
Look, man, I am dying
because of your photo op,

09:17.304 --> 09:19.323
and now I'm dying because
of this fucking psycho.

09:19.353 --> 09:21.950
- And what kind
of masseuse is this,

09:21.977 --> 09:24.225
like a masseuse masseuse
or an escort?

09:24.249 --> 09:26.846
- Julia got her from
the Speaker of the Assembly!

09:26.873 --> 09:28.227
- We're in room five.

09:28.250 --> 09:29.723
- Okay, how many people
know about this?

09:29.754 --> 09:31.456
- Just us.

09:31.482 --> 09:33.763
Come on, man.
This is-

09:33.786 --> 09:35.171
This could be a career killer.

09:35.194 --> 09:37.889
- Okay, I need 15 minutes here-

09:37.914 --> 09:38.874
make it 10-

09:38.906 --> 09:41.853
and I am on this.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.934
malnourished children,

09:43.963 --> 09:46.112
AIDS rampant,
people looking for decent jobs

09:46.139 --> 09:48.005
or any job,
for that matter,

09:48.026 --> 09:50.427
victims of an education system
horribly broken,

09:50.459 --> 09:53.023
and hope, something in
extremely short supply.

09:53.051 --> 09:54.557
- I completely agree,

09:54.587 --> 09:56.900
and I can only imagine
what it's like

09:56.923 --> 09:59.007
to try to run this
every year.

09:59.035 --> 10:01.730
And next year, you're gonna have
even less money for this clinic.

10:01.755 --> 10:03.555
So in terms of fund-raising,

10:03.579 --> 10:04.736
I think I should
put you in touch

10:04.764 --> 10:06.815
with some deep-pocket guys
in Woodside,

10:06.844 --> 10:08.895
Pacific Heights,
internet do-gooder-

10:08.924 --> 10:10.529
- I want to run for governor.

10:13.116 --> 10:15.582
Excuse me?

10:15.612 --> 10:18.013
- I want to run for governor.

10:19.389 --> 10:22.150
Well, I guess that's one way
to solve your problem.

10:22.172 --> 10:24.770
Okay, do you mind
if I ask you why?

10:24.796 --> 10:26.434
- For 9 years,
I have worked 12,

10:26.461 --> 10:27.585
14 hours a day here,

10:27.613 --> 10:28.999
seeing what's working
in our society

10:29.021 --> 10:30.592
and, more importantly,
what isn't.

10:30.621 --> 10:31.778
And I'm not
just a physician, I-

10:32.893 --> 10:33.952
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah?

10:33.982 --> 10:35.368
- What do you want me
to tell Maria's mom?

10:35.390 --> 10:36.808
- Nothing from Children's?

10:36.829 --> 10:39.208
Okay, we're gonna
have to road-trip it.

10:39.230 --> 10:41.445
Get in their faces.
Guilt them into the transplant.

10:41.470 --> 10:43.205
And ask the OR nurses
when Chris Anderson

10:43.230 --> 10:44.289
gets out of his last surgery.

10:44.318 --> 10:45.606
- Sure.
- Okay.

10:45.630 --> 10:48.096
- Dim sum on the way back?
- Perfect, thanks.

10:48.127 --> 10:50.113
Sorry.
My life.

10:50.143 --> 10:52.162
Anyway, I'm not just
a physician.

10:52.190 --> 10:53.958
I also do community organizing,

10:53.983 --> 10:56.231
a job qualification
that didn't hurt our president.

10:56.255 --> 10:58.688
And, uh, not
to sound too immodest,

10:58.719 --> 11:00.868
but I think I can make
people's lives better.

11:00.895 --> 11:02.019
- Look.
Forgive me.

11:02.047 --> 11:03.553
You're Dan's sister,
and I love him,

11:03.583 --> 11:06.049
and you seem like
a very nice person yourself,

11:06.079 --> 11:08.360
but I got to tell you,
and I think, as a doctor,

11:08.384 --> 11:09.704
you'll understand
when I say this:

11:09.727 --> 11:11.081
You need to have
your head examined.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.799
I mean, seriously,
because this is insane.

11:13.824 --> 11:15.810
- Running a free clinic
with what the state gives me,

11:15.840 --> 11:17.891
that's insane too.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.939
- Okay, um, all right.

11:19.969 --> 11:21.125
We had something that came up,

11:21.152 --> 11:22.211
so I don't have
a ton of time,

11:22.241 --> 11:24.773
but let me just
walk you through this.

11:24.801 --> 11:29.122
If you are ballsy enough
or crazy enough to do this,

11:29.153 --> 11:32.361
I can promise you
an unending barrage

11:32.385 --> 11:34.983
of innuendo, vitriol, and lies.

11:35.009 --> 11:36.515
Everything will be
on the public record,

11:36.546 --> 11:39.012
from the dope that you smoked
in the 11th grade

11:39.041 --> 11:40.711
to the blow you did
with your girlfriends

11:40.738 --> 11:43.782
during your college lesbian
experimentation period.

11:43.810 --> 11:47.499
There's not one moment
of your past

11:47.522 --> 11:51.079
that will not be scrutinized
in excruciating detail.

11:51.106 --> 11:52.874
- Done?
- Not yet.

11:52.899 --> 11:55.812
After that all comes out
and more,

11:55.843 --> 11:58.702
the facts will be twisted,
stomped, and exaggerated

11:58.723 --> 12:00.939
to the point that you will
no longer recognize them.

12:00.963 --> 12:04.869
And if that doesn't do it,
new facts will be made up

12:04.899 --> 12:05.958
so they can destroy you.

12:05.987 --> 12:07.406
- Done?
- Not yet.

12:07.427 --> 12:10.984
And then they'll say-
and I'll say it right now-

12:11.011 --> 12:13.325
what the hell qualifications
do you have to be governor?

12:13.348 --> 12:16.588
- In my job, I work
with every sort of person

12:16.612 --> 12:18.347
a giant array of problems.

12:18.372 --> 12:21.002
I run a team that daily
produces real, tangible results.

12:21.028 --> 12:23.047
I see our problems up close,

12:23.077 --> 12:25.030
and I think that I
can bring people together

12:25.060 --> 12:27.046
to accomplish things-
good things.

12:27.077 --> 12:28.103
- Good things?
- Yes.

12:28.133 --> 12:29.257
- Excuse me.

12:29.285 --> 12:30.726
This isn't
a high school service club.

12:30.757 --> 12:33.420
Okay, getting elected isn't
the Harvard-Yale debate society

12:33.445 --> 12:34.983
where the best argument
carries the day.

12:35.013 --> 12:38.221
These are steel-cage
death matches.

12:38.245 --> 12:40.842
Even if you win,
which, with all due respect,

12:40.870 --> 12:41.961
would be laughable,

12:41.989 --> 12:44.423
they will hobble you.

12:44.454 --> 12:46.604
They will shatter you.

12:46.630 --> 12:49.773
The process itself
will change you in ways

12:49.798 --> 12:51.665
that you cannot
even possibly imagine.

12:51.686 --> 12:52.940
Is that what you want,

12:52.966 --> 12:55.116
and is that what you want
for you, for your family?

12:55.142 --> 12:56.364
Do you have a family?

12:56.390 --> 12:58.890
- I'm a single mom.
I have a six-year-old son.

12:58.918 --> 13:01.646
- What about the kid's dad?
- Irrelevant.

13:01.671 --> 13:03.144
- Not if you're gonna do this.

13:03.175 --> 13:05.129
Nothing will be irrelevant.

13:05.159 --> 13:07.757
Despite this being
the bluest state in the country,

13:07.783 --> 13:09.421
it still knocked down
gay marriage

13:09.447 --> 13:11.401
and the legalization of pot.

13:11.432 --> 13:12.970
Over half of the people
in the state

13:13.000 --> 13:16.590
self-identify as born-agains
or regular church-goers,

13:16.616 --> 13:18.799
not exactly the profile
of someone

13:18.824 --> 13:20.329
who's gonna be voting for you.

13:20.360 --> 13:22.860
This is a blood sport, okay?

13:23.528 --> 13:27.085
I have worked for men
who were shot at in Vietnam,

13:27.112 --> 13:30.156
and the campaign literally
broke them down to tears.

13:30.185 --> 13:33.132
A man I loved-
who America loved,

13:33.161 --> 13:35.245
with the Navy Cross
and two Purple Hearts,

13:35.273 --> 13:37.554
sat crying
on my living room couch

13:37.577 --> 13:39.497
because of what the press said
about him and his family.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.473
You're too good a person
for this.

13:45.578 --> 13:48.044
Look.

13:48.074 --> 13:50.508
To win in politics,

13:50.538 --> 13:52.143
you have got to be the person

13:52.170 --> 13:54.865
who is willing to bring a gun
to a knife fight.

13:55.914 --> 13:57.747
- Is this your usual pep talk?

13:57.771 --> 13:59.441
- No.

13:59.467 --> 14:02.194
- Well, that's good, I guess.

14:02.219 --> 14:03.692
- No, this one's
for friends and family.

14:03.723 --> 14:05.294
Usually it's worse.

14:05.323 --> 14:07.472
- Hmm.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.996
- She wants to be governor.
Oh, man.

14:11.019 --> 14:12.460
- I liked her.

14:12.491 --> 14:13.812
She was cool and sharp,

14:13.836 --> 14:16.847
and it seemed
like she really wanted it.

14:16.876 --> 14:19.092
- Well, I want to play shortstop
for the Giants,

14:19.116 --> 14:20.982
but it's not gonna happen
in this lifetime.

14:26.028 --> 14:27.414
Okay.

14:27.437 --> 14:29.357
Jimmy, you want to start us off?

14:29.389 --> 14:31.288
- This is our friend
Tawny Shearson,

14:31.309 --> 14:32.465
courtesy of YouTube

14:32.492 --> 14:35.254
at her massage school
graduation picnic.

14:35.277 --> 14:37.492
- So she is an actual masseuse?
This is not a set-up?

14:37.517 --> 14:39.863
- Licensed
and with six years' experience.

14:39.885 --> 14:41.326
- Oh, that sucks.

14:41.357 --> 14:42.743
- But with other experience too.

14:42.765 --> 14:45.330
She had the misfortune
of being arrested twice

14:45.358 --> 14:46.776
for prostitution.

14:46.797 --> 14:48.151
The first time,
she pleaded guilty

14:48.174 --> 14:49.462
and was sentenced to probation.

14:49.486 --> 14:50.926
The other time,
charges were dropped.

14:50.958 --> 14:53.359
- Okay, so we're not dealing
with the Virgin Mary here.

14:53.390 --> 14:54.416
- Exactly.

14:54.446 --> 14:56.181
And you, sir,
are a war hero

14:56.206 --> 14:57.265
who served your country

14:57.295 --> 14:58.866
in the freezing mountains
of Afghanistan

14:58.894 --> 15:01.077
while she was selling her pussy
at the Beverly Hills hotel.

15:01.102 --> 15:03.154
So if it becomes her word
against yours,

15:03.183 --> 15:04.143
you should be okay.

15:04.174 --> 15:05.812
That's the good news.

15:05.839 --> 15:08.055
- Okay, tell me the bad news.

15:08.079 --> 15:09.432
- She's a pro,

15:09.455 --> 15:12.249
and you're on her massage table
in your boxers.

15:12.271 --> 15:13.690
That's our bogey.

15:13.712 --> 15:14.966
- Do we know
what she's asking for?

15:14.991 --> 15:16.661
- $2 million.
- Oh, forget that.

15:16.688 --> 15:18.390
Jimmy, could you bring up
the next thing?

15:18.416 --> 15:20.315
Okay, we just
threw this together,

15:20.336 --> 15:22.453
probably a little early,
but we had to know.

15:22.480 --> 15:24.182
You want to know why
you're up seven points?

15:24.208 --> 15:25.168
This is why.

15:25.200 --> 15:26.935
Soccer moms, 35 to 45.

15:26.961 --> 15:28.215
These are your people.

15:28.240 --> 15:30.259
<i>- No Way would I believe him.</i>

15:30.289 --> 15:33.115
<i>- And if she had
a shady past</i>

15:33.136 --> 15:35.286
<i>and was a known and proven liar?</i>

15:35.313 --> 15:36.371
<i>- I don't know.</i>

15:36.401 --> 15:37.972
<i>Someone who looks like that?</i>

15:38.001 --> 15:39.289
<i>He's still a guy.</i>

15:39.313 --> 15:41.397
<i>- Guys do what they're gonna do.</i>

15:41.425 --> 15:42.811
<i>- And how about
if someone told you</i>

15:42.833 --> 15:45.561
<i>that he was in a state
of semi-consciousness</i>

15:45.585 --> 15:46.971
<i>because of all the pain,</i>

15:46.993 --> 15:49.787
<i>and that's Why he didn't realize
how bad it might look,</i>

15:49.809 --> 15:51.195
<i>him being in there with her?</i>

15:51.217 --> 15:52.855
<i>- If my husband
said something like that,</i>

15:52.882 --> 15:54.869
<i>not only would I think
that he's a cheating jerk</i>

15:54.898 --> 15:57.364
<i>but that he can't make up
a halfway decent lie.</i>

15:57.394 --> 15:59.926
- Okay, they were my people.

15:59.955 --> 16:02.104
- And if I told you
that because of a war injury,

16:02.131 --> 16:04.051
sometimes he takes
strong pain medication,

16:04.083 --> 16:06.461
which makes him drowsy,
and that's why this happened?

16:06.482 --> 16:08.315
- Well, that's 10% better,

16:08.339 --> 16:10.904
but 90% pure lame-o.

16:10.931 --> 16:12.469
Come on.
Really.

16:14.483 --> 16:15.804
- They love you
when you're talking

16:15.827 --> 16:17.432
about smaller class sizes
but not so much

16:17.459 --> 16:19.543
when you're trying to explain
away a quickie with Tawny.

16:19.571 --> 16:21.438
- I am such an idiot.

16:21.460 --> 16:23.926
- You are anything but.

16:23.956 --> 16:26.237
You got caught up
in some nasty shit.

16:26.260 --> 16:28.639
We're gonna figure out a way
to get you out of it.

16:29.492 --> 16:30.649
- How's she gonna spill it?

16:30.677 --> 16:32.063
- She's got some kind of
in at Fox.

16:32.085 --> 16:34.617
This asshole they brought in
to run KXSF, Roger Fillmore,

16:34.645 --> 16:36.445
he's practically
smacking his lips on this one,

16:36.469 --> 16:38.553
not to mention his riding-high
Tea Party pals.

16:38.581 --> 16:39.541
This is their wet dream.

16:39.573 --> 16:41.144
- So what are they waiting for?

16:41.173 --> 16:43.552
- She's teed it up but hasn't
given the deliverables.

16:43.573 --> 16:44.762
This is straight-up pay to play.

16:44.789 --> 16:46.110
And even if we do pay,

16:46.134 --> 16:48.185
Roger is still probably
gonna run with it.

16:48.214 --> 16:49.819
- Okay, look,
we're gonna figure out a way

16:49.845 --> 16:51.286
to inoculate you against this,

16:51.318 --> 16:53.217
and we're gonna dig up the shit
on this girl.

16:53.238 --> 16:55.005
What do you think
is the best room service?

16:55.030 --> 16:57.147
- Carl Ludwig
at I-(COP loves us.

16:57.174 --> 16:58.712
- Or Maggie Darcy?

16:58.742 --> 17:01.143
- I have two words for you:

17:01.174 --> 17:02.134
Peaches O'Dell.

17:13.463 --> 17:14.521
. He)'-
. He)'-

17:15.830 --> 17:17.435
- Can I buy you another coffee?

17:17.464 --> 17:18.490
- No, thanks.

17:18.520 --> 17:19.873
I got enough
to last me all night,

17:19.896 --> 17:21.849
which, at the rate you're
dumping your garbage on me,

17:21.878 --> 17:23.233
is where I'm gonna be again.

17:23.256 --> 17:25.209
- You did a great job
with that Tawny mug shot.

17:25.240 --> 17:27.040
- She's a ho.
- She's a ho with a story.

17:27.064 --> 17:28.352
- Yeah, well, like all of us.

17:28.376 --> 17:29.566
- How much it cost you?

17:29.592 --> 17:31.098
- Nothing.

17:31.128 --> 17:33.311
I did a little thing
for an Interpol guy

17:33.337 --> 17:36.163
running a button cam video
on a dot-com gazillionaire.

17:36.184 --> 17:37.625
- A thing?
- A thing.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.708
You don't want to know.
Trust me.

17:39.737 --> 17:42.781
And I got you a little present.

17:42.809 --> 17:44.130
- This wouldn't have
anything to do

17:44.153 --> 17:45.920
with health-related issues,
would it?

17:45.945 --> 17:46.905
- Try everything.

17:46.937 --> 17:48.126
Your buddy in Kentucky,

17:48.153 --> 17:50.499
the ex-left fielder for
the Baltimore Orioles, no less-

17:50.521 --> 17:52.191
Guess what?
He's mortal.

17:52.218 --> 17:53.691
- I'm heartbroken.
- Yeah, me too.

17:53.722 --> 17:54.911
Who would have thunk it?

17:54.938 --> 17:56.291
Mr. "I used to play
in the big leagues

17:56.314 --> 17:58.147
while you were a pussy
in the Peace Corps,"

17:58.170 --> 17:59.327
arrogant prick fuck.

17:59.354 --> 18:00.708
- And this is solid?
- Platinum.

18:00.730 --> 18:02.945
- Actually seen
or talked about?

18:02.970 --> 18:04.890
- What do you take me for?

18:04.922 --> 18:06.363
- As our friend the Gipper
always said,

18:06.394 --> 18:08.097
<i>"Doveryaf, no proveryaf."</i>

18:08.123 --> 18:10.239
Trust but verify.

18:10.267 --> 18:12.133
- Okay.

18:12.155 --> 18:14.403
<i>Well, no pro-pro-prover-</i>

18:14.427 --> 18:15.780
Look at it.

18:21.755 --> 18:22.879
- Wow.

18:22.907 --> 18:23.999
- Yeah.

18:24.027 --> 18:25.947
You can kiss me
if you like.

18:25.980 --> 18:27.551
- Irregular heartbeat.

18:27.580 --> 18:29.479
He's had it for years.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.202
And one of the great truisms
of the game is,

18:31.228 --> 18:33.444
when voters start to worry
about a candidate's health,

18:33.468 --> 18:35.519
<i>it is a gigantic
numbers suck.</i>

18:35.548 --> 18:36.672
- Well, sure, Paul.

18:36.701 --> 18:38.272
But I can't exactly
tell a local news honey

18:38.301 --> 18:41.062
I just happened to sneak a peek
at Perkins' medical records.

18:41.085 --> 18:43.333
- <i>Well, no,</i> {mean
<i>not like that.</i>

18:43.357 --> 18:45.277
- How, then?

18:45.309 --> 18:46.979
<i>- It's all about how
you frame the narrative.</i>

18:47.005 --> 18:49.471
<i>Look, this is a race
about leadership.</i>

18:49.501 --> 18:52.164
<i>One guy is using his position
in the state senate</i>

18:52.189 --> 18:54.110
to conduct a completely
meritless witch hunt

18:54.141 --> 18:55.909
against a man
who has served the public

18:55.934 --> 18:57.156
his entire adult life,

18:57.182 --> 18:59.681
a man who works
for the state of Kentucky 24/7.

18:59.710 --> 19:00.736
I mean, look-

19:00.766 --> 19:02.020
Look what time
we're talking now.

19:02.046 --> 19:03.039
It's what?

19:03.070 --> 19:05.155
It's 3:15 in the morning
your time.

19:05.182 --> 19:08.194
Yeah.

19:08.223 --> 19:10.274
- What you do

19:10.303 --> 19:11.722
<i>is incredibly difficult.</i>

19:11.743 --> 19:13.762
<i>It requires tremendous
strength and stamina.</i>

19:13.790 --> 19:15.361
- Yeah, you're fucking
telling me.

19:15.391 --> 19:16.864
Trying to get
my antiforeclosure thing

19:16.895 --> 19:19.361
<i>through this Wing-nut
legislature is like</i>

19:19.391 --> 19:22.273
<i>trying to run a Red Sox flag
up in Yankee Stadium.</i>

19:22.303 --> 19:23.362
- How's it going?

19:23.391 --> 19:26.119
- Ah, you know,
2 steps forward, 1 'I,-"2 back.

19:26.144 --> 19:27.464
And not to sound
like some kind of ad

19:27.487 --> 19:28.514
you guys do, but my mama

19:28.544 --> 19:29.865
could've used
something like this.

19:29.888 --> 19:31.209
<i>And if these assholes
want a fight,</i>

19:31.232 --> 19:32.520
<i>they're gonna get a fight.</i>

19:32.544 --> 19:35.239
<i>- And it's an incredibly
difficult fight, right?</i>

19:35.265 --> 19:37.730
<i>I mean, look, all We're doing
is asking the voters</i>

19:37.760 --> 19:39.844
<i>to compare the two candidates'
health records</i>

19:39.872 --> 19:42.251
<i>and make an informed choice.</i>

19:42.273 --> 19:44.422
<i>mean, you're gonna release
everything you have, right?</i>

19:44.449 --> 19:45.835
<i>mean, and is there
anything in there</i>

19:45.857 --> 19:47.014
<i>that I need
to be Worried about?</i>

19:47.041 --> 19:48.132
- Nothing.

19:48.161 --> 19:50.027
<i>- Really nothing?
- Trust me.</i>

19:50.049 --> 19:51.849
Despite decades
of avoiding the gym

19:51.873 --> 19:53.347
like that's where
you get dengue fever,

19:53.377 --> 19:57.066
I have, probably unfairly,
been dealt a pretty good hand.

19:57.090 --> 19:59.109
- I'm gonna have my guy
look it over anyway.

19:59.138 --> 20:00.840
And then when we do release it,

20:00.866 --> 20:03.725
every day, at every stop
through every news cycle,

20:03.746 --> 20:06.311
we hammer him to release his.

20:06.339 --> 20:07.725
- What if he doesn't go for it?

20:07.747 --> 20:09.220
- <i>Well, that's exactly
what we want.</i>

20:09.250 --> 20:11.716
More than anything else,
it's the refusal to release

20:11.747 --> 20:12.707
that creates the story.

20:12.739 --> 20:14.157
Look.

20:14.178 --> 20:17.703
<i>Campaigns always come down
to one thing above all else."</i>

20:17.731 --> 20:19.466
<i>Who do you trust?</i>

20:19.491 --> 20:21.291
<i>And by not releasing,</i>

20:21.315 --> 20:22.853
<i>that ca uses people
to lose trust.</i>

20:22.883 --> 20:24.869
And once you've lost
the public trust,

20:24.899 --> 20:26.220
you're a dead man walking.

20:26.244 --> 20:28.230
- Better him than me.

20:28.260 --> 20:29.930
- And that's just the beginning.

20:29.956 --> 20:32.204
Then we get some credible
third parties down there

20:32.228 --> 20:33.701
to just pound him

20:33.732 --> 20:37.038
<i>ask him, "Has he ever
failed a steroids test?”</i>

20:37.061 --> 20:39.887
<i>You think Roger Clemens
on steroids was a big story?</i>

20:39.908 --> 20:41.327
<i>How about a guy
running for governor</i>

20:41.349 --> 20:42.571
<i>on the juice?</i>

20:42.597 --> 20:43.885
<i>And the nurses are with us</i>

20:43.909 --> 20:45.349
big-time, we get them out there,

20:45.381 --> 20:48.295
picketing his fucking office
every week, and then we get

20:48.325 --> 20:49.930
<i>our blog buddies
to float a story</i>

20:49.957 --> 20:53.034
<i>that he may be suffering
from some sort of STD,</i>

20:53.061 --> 20:55.975
and then we put the flyers on
the windshield at the churches,

20:56.006 --> 20:58.352
and then we follow that up
with a killer push poll.

20:59.717 --> 21:02.249
- Well, that's nice, considering
he's got none of those things.

21:02.277 --> 21:05.900
- Well, maybe he has,
and maybe he hasn't.

21:05.926 --> 21:08.272
We're just asking the questions.

21:08.294 --> 21:10.313
Look, your guy loves to talk

21:10.342 --> 21:11.816
about hitting
major-league pitching?

21:11.846 --> 21:13.745
Well, politics is the NFL.

21:13.766 --> 21:16.396
And we're gonna hit him
helmet-to-helmet.

21:16.423 --> 21:19.304
- Let's say he does release them
and people fee! <i>sorry</i> for him?

21:19.335 --> 21:22.314
<i>Then {just look like some kind
of</i> a <i>jerk for bringing it up.</i>

21:22.343 --> 21:23.761
- You didn't know
what was in it!

21:23.783 --> 21:25.137
You're as surprised
as anyone else.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.633
He was an all-star
baseball player,

21:26.663 --> 21:27.820
for Christ's sake.

21:27.847 --> 21:29.801
Of course,
you feel for him,

21:29.831 --> 21:32.778
<i>and you'll keep him
in yours and Sophia's prayers,</i>

21:32.807 --> 21:34.128
<i>but what
you're more interested in</i>

21:34.152 --> 21:35.625
<i>is who is best qualified
to lead a state</i>

21:35.656 --> 21:38.286
<i>that nobody could possibly
care about more than you.</i>

21:38.312 --> 21:40.178
- Got it.

21:41.385 --> 21:44.462
Crazy times, man.

21:44.488 --> 21:47.250
<i>Hey, is it true Stephen Green
got a hummer from a pro?</i>

21:47.273 --> 21:48.910
<i>- Where did you hear that?</i>

21:48.937 --> 21:50.191
- {heard <i>it</i>

21:50.217 --> 21:52.498
- Come on.

21:52.521 --> 21:53.809
<i>- One of Green's guys
did the, uh-</i>

21:53.833 --> 21:55.535
<i>the Webb race
with one of mine.</i>

21:57.609 --> 22:00.882
That makes my stuff
look like a walk in the park.

22:00.905 --> 22:02.510
<i>Was she hot?</i>

22:03.914 --> 22:06.893
<i>- I can neither confirm
nor deny the story.</i>

22:06.922 --> 22:07.914
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:07.946 --> 22:09.005
Was she hot?

22:09.034 --> 22:10.060
<i>- Allegedly, very.</i>

22:18.763 --> 22:21.044
Hey, Peaches!

22:21.067 --> 22:23.380
- Really?
You're coming to me?

22:23.403 --> 22:24.789
- Always.
- Oh, come on.

22:24.811 --> 22:25.870
When I'm looking my worst?

22:25.900 --> 22:27.471
- Your worst
is 1,000 times better

22:27.499 --> 22:28.558
than most people's best.

22:28.587 --> 22:30.093
Weren't you a Miss something?

22:30.123 --> 22:31.247
Nebraska?
- Arizona.

22:31.275 --> 22:32.563
- Arizona.
- Miss Arizona.

22:32.587 --> 22:34.988
Some of us had to get ahead
without the fancy schools.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.689
- Hey, while you were polishing
your tiara,

22:36.716 --> 22:38.287
I was busting my ass
on construction sites

22:38.316 --> 22:39.254
up in Minnesota.

22:39.276 --> 22:41.044
- Oh, please.

22:41.068 --> 22:43.119
Didn't you go
to Harvard Law or something?

22:43.148 --> 22:44.501
Sounds kind of silver-spoony
to me.

22:44.524 --> 22:45.551
- Try wooden spoon.

22:45.580 --> 22:48.275
My dad was
a building trades union steward.

22:48.300 --> 22:49.522
That's how I got
all my cushy jobs

22:49.549 --> 22:51.633
lugging lumber
up four flights of stairs.

22:51.661 --> 22:53.266
- Well, you've got me
without the glam,

22:53.292 --> 22:55.508
and as much as I do
enjoy seeing you,

22:55.533 --> 22:57.487
I don't think you came
all the way across town

22:57.517 --> 22:58.739
to check me out
in my sweaty gear.

22:58.765 --> 23:01.046
- I have a story for you.
- Oh, stop it.

23:01.070 --> 23:03.253
- I hear that CNN
may be bringing you to D.C.

23:03.278 --> 23:05.013
to try you out nationally?

23:05.038 --> 23:05.976
- Well, it could be.

23:05.998 --> 23:06.958
- Well, this could help.

23:06.989 --> 23:08.310
- Paul, whatever
you've got for me,

23:08.334 --> 23:09.556
it cannot be as good

23:09.582 --> 23:11.153
as what I'm getting
from Campbell's guys,

23:11.182 --> 23:13.430
which, as I understand it,

23:13.454 --> 23:17.426
involves a tasty treat
from a smokin' hot masseuse.

23:17.454 --> 23:19.571
- Well, Peaches,
of course we're gonna deny that.

23:19.599 --> 23:21.301
We are talking about
a United States senator

23:21.327 --> 23:22.800
and a Purple Heart winner

23:22.831 --> 23:24.697
with a documented history
of a bad back

23:24.719 --> 23:27.546
injured, I might add,
in service of his country.

23:27.567 --> 23:29.651
- Right, and John F. Kennedy
had a bad back,

23:29.679 --> 23:31.599
but it didn't stop him
from fucking Marilyn Monroe.

23:31.632 --> 23:33.880
- This is no Marilyn.
- No, Marilyn was a secret.

23:33.904 --> 23:35.192
And not this baby.

23:35.216 --> 23:37.365
She is hot,
and she is mine-oh-mine.

23:37.392 --> 23:38.352
- Okay, look.

23:38.384 --> 23:40.053
Like everything else,

23:40.080 --> 23:42.394
there's another side to this.

23:42.416 --> 23:43.922
And I thought that you and I

23:43.952 --> 23:45.371
might be able
to work something out.

23:45.392 --> 23:47.225
- Hmm.

23:47.249 --> 23:48.241
Not friggin' likely.

23:48.272 --> 23:49.625
<i>-</i> Okay-

23:49.648 --> 23:50.675
- What?

23:50.704 --> 23:52.472
- I have a friend who tells me

23:52.497 --> 23:54.646
that your newest anchor,
Connie Connor,

23:54.673 --> 23:57.816
went to a bachelorette party
in Vegas a few years back.

23:57.841 --> 23:58.932
- And?

23:59.986 --> 24:01.590
- Things got pretty wild.

24:04.049 --> 24:06.232
- Oh, yeah!

24:06.257 --> 24:07.217
Okay.

24:07.250 --> 24:09.050
Okay, your friends are good.

24:09.074 --> 24:10.427
These on the net?

24:10.449 --> 24:11.409
- Not yet.

24:11.442 --> 24:14.421
So...

24:14.450 --> 24:16.982
Some room service?

24:17.011 --> 24:18.331
- Mm.

24:18.354 --> 24:20.221
- Am I gonna love this?

24:20.243 --> 24:21.661
- Do you love me?
- Deeply.

24:21.682 --> 24:23.931
No, show me the spot first.

24:23.954 --> 24:25.526
<i>- I used to be a Navy pilot.</i>

24:25.555 --> 24:28.916
<i>On a mission in Afghanistan,
my helicopter was shot down.</i>

24:28.947 --> 24:31.544
<i>Both of my legs and four ribs
were broken.</i>

24:32.563 --> 24:34.844
<i>The enemy came
to finish us off.</i>

24:34.867 --> 24:36.635
<i>The young officer
that I was transporting</i>

24:36.660 --> 24:39.224
<i>single-handedly fought off
an entire squad of Taliban</i>

24:39.251 --> 24:41.499
<i>until reinforcements
could arrive.</i>

24:41.524 --> 24:44.024
<i>didn't think
I'd make it through that night.</i>

24:44.052 --> 24:46.136
<i>When the rescue choppers
finally came,</i>

24:46.164 --> 24:50.682
<i>that same officer carried me
over 1/4 of a mile on his back.</i>

24:50.709 --> 24:52.695
<i>By ah' accounts,
{should be dead</i>

24:52.725 --> 24:55.289
<i>But I'm not,
thanks to one man</i>

24:55.317 --> 24:57.947
<i>Stephen Green fought for me
with everything he had,</i>

24:57.973 --> 24:59.544
<i>and now he's fighting
just as hard</i>

24:59.573 --> 25:02.486
<i>for all
of California's families.</i>

25:02.517 --> 25:05.463
<i>- I was so very proud to serve
with Captain Johnny Duncan,</i>

25:05.493 --> 25:07.807
<i>a true American hero.</i>

25:07.830 --> 25:10.013
<i>I'm Stephen Green,
and I approve this</i> message

25:18.774 --> 25:19.767
- Some light reading?

25:19.798 --> 25:21.053
- Yeah,
it's for that new cruiser,

25:21.079 --> 25:23.228
which costs more
than an aircraft carrier did

25:23.255 --> 25:24.412
when I was coming up.

25:24.438 --> 25:26.337
- Well, somebody
will get rich on it.

25:26.359 --> 25:27.515
- Yeah, you know,
I got a feeling

25:27.543 --> 25:28.667
it doesn't even do

25:28.695 --> 25:30.649
what the Navy says
it's supposed to do.

25:30.679 --> 25:32.120
But you try
to find real data on it,

25:32.151 --> 25:33.537
then good luck.

25:33.559 --> 25:34.651
Thank you.

25:34.680 --> 25:36.863
- You have a call to make.

25:40.759 --> 25:42.200
Mandy Denton.

25:42.232 --> 25:43.803
- Sounds vaguely familiar.

25:43.831 --> 25:45.469
- She runs commercials
for Campbell.

25:45.495 --> 25:48.093
- Oh, God, those cloying, what,

25:48.121 --> 25:50.653
"I believe how a guy
treats his family,"

25:50.680 --> 25:52.513
those "Mr. Family Values
till you want to retch,"

25:52.536 --> 25:53.474
those ads?

25:53.496 --> 25:55.483
- Yeah, that's her.

25:55.512 --> 25:56.898
- Good night.

26:00.121 --> 26:02.205
- You know what
they're doing, right?

26:02.233 --> 26:04.099
The more they pound
family values,

26:04.121 --> 26:07.362
they're just laying track
for you-know-who.

26:07.385 --> 26:08.574
- Scum.

26:08.601 --> 26:11.548
- First-class.

26:11.577 --> 26:12.898
But it turns out that Mandy

26:12.922 --> 26:15.105
not only makes the commercials
for Campbell.

26:15.130 --> 26:17.247
She also makes his bed.

26:17.274 --> 26:19.075
It's all one big happy family,

26:19.098 --> 26:22.371
along with Roger Fillmore
down at KXSF.

26:22.394 --> 26:24.926
But he's really just
a mouthpiece for Campbell

26:24.955 --> 26:28.512
and his 90 million bucks
he's got earmarked to bury you.

26:28.539 --> 26:30.722
- Yeah, family values.

26:30.747 --> 26:32.318
What's Roger actually got?

26:32.347 --> 26:34.082
- He's trying
to swiftboat you.

26:34.107 --> 26:36.191
He's got all his guys meeting
with anybody and everybody

26:36.220 --> 26:37.278
you ever served with.

26:37.307 --> 26:39.970
- Yeah?
Happy hunting.

26:39.996 --> 26:41.895
What's Mandy's story?

26:41.916 --> 26:44.065
- She's good at what she does.

26:44.092 --> 26:47.485
She's got two kids at home.
The husband's a dot-com guy.

26:47.516 --> 26:49.633
I don't think he knows.

26:49.660 --> 26:52.290
So...

26:52.316 --> 26:53.669
- Okay.
Roger?

26:53.692 --> 26:55.460
I want you
to blow that asshole up.

26:55.484 --> 26:57.121
This Mandy thing, kill it.

26:57.148 --> 26:59.200
She's a civilian.

27:02.173 --> 27:03.744
What is it?

27:03.773 --> 27:06.053
- Talking points
for the governor on his budget.

27:06.077 --> 27:07.780
- And what do you know
about that?

27:07.806 --> 27:10.533
- Six weeks ago, not much.

27:10.557 --> 27:12.325
- Okay, but you can fake it.

27:12.350 --> 27:13.987
- Yeah, it's nothing.

27:14.014 --> 27:15.716
My parents think
that I'm taking some time off

27:15.741 --> 27:17.247
before applying to med school.

27:17.278 --> 27:19.558
And remember,
you're not Samantha

27:19.582 --> 27:21.797
but a guy named Sam.

27:21.822 --> 27:23.240
- Oh, thanks.

27:23.263 --> 27:25.958
- You're welcome.

27:25.983 --> 27:26.943
Don't be pissed.

27:26.974 --> 27:29.604
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, Paul.

27:29.631 --> 27:32.359
- Hey, it's not too late
to call you, is it?

27:32.383 --> 27:35.209
- Uh, no.

27:35.231 --> 27:37.414
- Do you remember the, uh...
- Hi, Paul.

27:37.439 --> 27:38.912
- The football player
who was wanting to run

27:38.943 --> 27:40.100
for mayor of San Diego?

27:40.127 --> 27:41.317
- Tony Blanchard.

27:41.344 --> 27:42.500
- Right, right.

27:42.527 --> 27:45.124
Right, and doesn't he have
a book coming out?

27:45.151 --> 27:47.301
<i>- First and Goal,
something like that.</i>

27:47.327 --> 27:49.128
- Let's get him in here.

27:49.152 --> 27:50.723
<i>-</i> Okay-

28:05.153 --> 28:08.427
- Okay, so, uh, 89.

28:08.449 --> 28:09.835
You want to push it?

28:09.858 --> 28:11.178
Eight, nine.

28:11.201 --> 28:13.963
Perfect.
Thank you.

28:17.314 --> 28:18.732
Hmm.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.651
You and me.
Lunch.

28:28.674 --> 28:30.093
- Okay.
- You want pizza?

28:30.115 --> 28:31.075
Yeah?
Okay.

28:34.978 --> 28:36.779
You're gonna have to wait
just a second, honey.

28:36.803 --> 28:38.669
Come on.

28:38.691 --> 28:40.328
Hello.
Hey, guys.

28:40.355 --> 28:45.102
Petitions from people
who want me to run.

28:45.124 --> 28:47.689
- Did you have every junkie
in the Mission sign these?

28:47.715 --> 28:49.865
- No.
Okay, yes.

28:49.892 --> 28:52.008
But I also got architects,
other physicians,

28:52.036 --> 28:54.568
waitresses, delivery guys,
teachers, painters.

28:54.596 --> 28:57.095
- Okay, look, I have no doubt
those people love you.

28:57.124 --> 28:59.557
But you also need the farmers
in the Central Valley,

28:59.588 --> 29:01.126
the soccer moms in Concord,

29:01.156 --> 29:02.891
and the second-
and third-generation Latinos

29:02.916 --> 29:04.619
in San Bernardino
to love you too,

29:04.644 --> 29:06.729
not to mention the golf crowd
in Santa Barbara.

29:06.756 --> 29:08.491
- Hey, I was raised
in Santa Barbara.

29:08.517 --> 29:09.903
My dad was a doctor there
for 35 years.

29:09.925 --> 29:12.359
- Okay, well, great,
but that's not gonna help you

29:12.389 --> 29:13.677
and your druggie friends.

29:13.701 --> 29:15.720
And then the other side of that,
your parents' friends

29:15.749 --> 29:17.549
don't want to know
about the dirty needle crowd.

29:17.573 --> 29:19.243
And here's the cold reality:

29:19.270 --> 29:20.743
You have no name recognition.

29:20.774 --> 29:22.607
So how the hell
are you gonna pay for this?

29:22.630 --> 29:24.135
- That's what the web's for.

29:24.166 --> 29:25.585
There has to be a million people

29:25.606 --> 29:27.854
willing to pay $10
for real change.

29:27.878 --> 29:30.278
Boom.
There's $10 million for you.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.012
- California has more
local media markets

29:32.038 --> 29:33.326
than any state in the union.

29:33.350 --> 29:37.486
It costs $2.5 million a week
for a statewide media buy.

29:37.511 --> 29:38.832
$10 million?

29:38.855 --> 29:41.070
Try multiplying that by five
just to get into the game.

29:41.095 --> 29:42.536
- Okay, then I'll get
4 million people.

29:42.567 --> 29:45.449
That's only 10% of the state
to pay $10.

29:45.479 --> 29:46.833
You got 40.

29:46.856 --> 29:48.361
You know, I got to-
I got to believe

29:48.391 --> 29:50.639
that one in ten people
will think

29:50.664 --> 29:52.137
for the price
of two frappuccinos

29:52.168 --> 29:54.765
they'll finally get a governor
who will really change things.

29:54.792 --> 29:56.113
- Okay, I get it.

29:56.136 --> 29:59.442
I'm sure you would be
a great governor.

29:59.464 --> 30:01.068
But I'm in the business
of winning.

30:01.096 --> 30:03.562
- I thought you were
in the business of helping.

30:03.593 --> 30:04.619
- Helping people who can win.

30:05.993 --> 30:07.117
- Hello?

30:07.144 --> 30:08.171
Great.
- Would you just-

30:08.200 --> 30:10.099
Would you-
would you just help me?

30:10.120 --> 30:12.466
Would you-
Would you think about it?

30:12.489 --> 30:14.574
- Kentucky.
He loved the talking points.

30:14.601 --> 30:16.882
- I have thought about it.

30:16.905 --> 30:18.291
I'm sorry.

30:20.202 --> 30:21.194
Hey.
Hey. No.

30:21.226 --> 30:22.350
- Come on, buddy.
We got to go.

30:22.378 --> 30:23.502
- For a girl born in Seoul,

30:23.530 --> 30:25.134
she's sure got
that Kentucky thing down.

30:25.162 --> 30:26.384
- Thank you.

30:26.410 --> 30:28.788
- Right?

30:28.811 --> 30:31.789
I think it's
gonna move the numbers a little.

30:31.818 --> 30:33.324
- Give me a break.

30:33.355 --> 30:35.788
- What?
- Look.

30:35.819 --> 30:38.318
<i>- I played professional baseball
for 15 years</i>

30:38.347 --> 30:39.536
<i>and was fortunate enough</i>

30:39.563 --> 30:41.876
to make the American League
AH-Star team <i>six</i> times.

30:41.899 --> 30:43.602
<i>And later, /shared
in the highest honor</i>

30:43.627 --> 30:44.686
<i>in team sports."</i>

30:44.715 --> 30:46.352
<i>Winning the World Series.</i>

30:46.379 --> 30:47.667
<i>And after that amazing season,</i>

30:47.691 --> 30:49.808
{came home to serve
in our <i>state</i> senate,

30:49.835 --> 30:52.018
<i>Where I stood up
for small businesses,</i>

30:52.044 --> 30:53.582
<i>cutting your taxes
and cracking down</i>

30:53.612 --> 30:54.703
<i>on bloated pensions</i>

30:54.732 --> 30:57.427
<i>for overpaid
and underworked bureaucrats.</i>

30:57.452 --> 30:59.406
But the greatest <i>honor</i>
{could ever have

30:59.436 --> 31:01.901
<i>is going to bat
for all of Kentucky</i>

31:01.932 --> 31:03.253
<i>as your governor.</i>

31:03.276 --> 31:04.597
<i>I'm Justin Perkins,</i>

31:04.621 --> 31:06.836
<i>and I approve this message.</i>

31:06.861 --> 31:08.694
<i>- Oy.</i>

31:08.717 --> 31:09.677
- Yeah, right?

31:11.181 --> 31:12.567
- Now, I don't have
an FBI badge,

31:12.589 --> 31:14.902
but I know blackmail
when I see it.

31:14.925 --> 31:16.595
- As I'm sure
you can understand,

31:16.621 --> 31:18.388
we see it rather differently.

31:18.413 --> 31:23.062
My client has suffered
enormous emotional damage.

31:23.085 --> 31:25.813
Imagine you're hired
to do a job,

31:25.838 --> 31:28.021
you do it exceptionally well
for six years,

31:28.046 --> 31:30.195
then suddenly,
out of the blue,

31:30.222 --> 31:33.649
you're hit on
by a United States senator?

31:33.678 --> 31:34.933
- Senator Green has

31:34.958 --> 31:37.817
a completely different
recollection of these events,

31:37.838 --> 31:39.126
and with all due respect,

31:39.151 --> 31:42.359
if it comes down to his word
against your client's,

31:42.383 --> 31:43.802
I think we both know who wins.

31:43.823 --> 31:44.914
- You're a bit overconfident.

31:44.943 --> 31:48.370
Do you have any idea
what faces your boss

31:48.399 --> 31:50.963
if he doesn't settle this case?

31:50.991 --> 31:55.542
A legal colonoscopy
without anesthesia.

31:55.568 --> 31:59.802
- Okay, I want to know
what you want.

31:59.824 --> 32:01.297
- Finally.

32:01.328 --> 32:02.583
What I want is a check-

32:02.608 --> 32:03.634
- Sweetheart, please.

32:03.664 --> 32:05.464
Let me handle this.

32:05.488 --> 32:08.500
What Miss Shearson wants
is three things:

32:08.528 --> 32:11.126
$3 million.

32:11.153 --> 32:13.204
What your client wants-
- Wasn't it $2 million?

32:13.233 --> 32:16.506
- It was $2 million
until your boss

32:16.529 --> 32:19.323
accused my client of extortion,

32:19.345 --> 32:21.811
a million-dollar costly mistake.

32:21.842 --> 32:25.115
- Look, even if we were
to pay that outrageous amount,

32:25.137 --> 32:27.189
what guarantee do we have
that we still wouldn't

32:27.217 --> 32:29.683
hear this story
from Peaches O'Dell

32:29.714 --> 32:31.384
or any of your other
media buddies?

32:31.410 --> 32:34.137
- Paul, I keep my promises.

32:34.162 --> 32:37.021
How do you think I built
this law firm?

32:37.043 --> 32:40.283
<i>-</i> Okay-

32:40.306 --> 32:43.187
All right.

32:43.219 --> 32:46.547
This is what I'm prepared
to offer you.

32:46.579 --> 32:48.314
And I really want you
to think about it,

32:48.339 --> 32:51.700
because this is as high
as it will ever get.

32:53.876 --> 32:56.124
Zero.

32:58.739 --> 33:01.501
That's my offer.

33:01.524 --> 33:03.356
- Well, I guess we're gonna
be hearing a lot more

33:03.380 --> 33:04.854
about a particular senator.

33:04.884 --> 33:06.238
Now, Paul,
I want you to understand,

33:06.261 --> 33:07.450
this is not a threat.

33:07.477 --> 33:08.983
It's just-
- You don't have much to go on.

33:09.012 --> 33:11.610
a sterling-silver reputation.

33:11.636 --> 33:14.234
multiple prostitution arrests.

33:14.260 --> 33:15.450
- Maybe.

33:15.477 --> 33:19.482
But we have something
that you don't have.

33:19.509 --> 33:21.528
We have a lab report

33:21.557 --> 33:24.984
from a forensic lab
in Mountain View.

33:25.013 --> 33:26.879
It shows Tawny's shirt.

33:26.901 --> 33:28.440
You want to guess what's on it?

33:31.062 --> 33:33.725
- I don't think I want to.

33:33.750 --> 33:34.972
- DNA

33:34.998 --> 33:36.384
in a stain,

33:36.406 --> 33:39.101
perfect match to your senator.

33:39.126 --> 33:42.815
It seems as if your guy
is being screwed again.

33:42.839 --> 33:45.567
Mr. Green, in the bedroom,

33:45.591 --> 33:47.936
with his happy little gun.

33:52.727 --> 33:54.113
- Why did he do it'?

33:55.127 --> 33:57.888
Look, politicians
are politicians

33:57.911 --> 34:00.606
because they have completely
interrelated strengths

34:00.632 --> 34:01.592
and frailties.

34:01.624 --> 34:03.294
They can be incredibly committed

34:03.320 --> 34:04.825
to truly changing the world

34:04.856 --> 34:07.257
and also be wildly
self-destructive.

34:07.288 --> 34:09.569
- I'll take the first
and pass on the second.

34:09.592 --> 34:12.353
- It's not so easy
in the real world.

34:12.376 --> 34:15.868
The qualities that make
a star politician-

34:15.896 --> 34:18.777
the need for the spotlight,
the quest for power,

34:18.809 --> 34:20.926
the ability to use people
and then discard them

34:20.953 --> 34:22.109
when you're through with them-

34:22.137 --> 34:23.840
is the exact same skill set

34:23.864 --> 34:26.244
that enables an FDR
to create the New Deal,

34:26.264 --> 34:29.309
saving the country
and having multiple affairs.

34:29.337 --> 34:31.585
Or Eisenhower,
liberate a continent

34:31.609 --> 34:33.987
and be carrying on an affair
with his aide the whole time.

34:34.010 --> 34:35.581
Or President Clinton

34:35.610 --> 34:37.409
presiding over
an unprecedented period

34:37.434 --> 34:38.851
of peace and prosperity

34:38.873 --> 34:41.090
and then banging
Monica Lewinsky.

34:41.114 --> 34:42.620
- To all our detriment.

34:42.650 --> 34:43.871
But is this something
that we got to have

34:43.898 --> 34:45.632
or something
we've just bought into?

34:45.658 --> 34:47.099
- You don't get
the outsized talent

34:47.130 --> 34:49.215
without the outsized weakness.

34:49.243 --> 34:51.458
And look, this isn't
a video game or a TV show.

34:51.483 --> 34:52.956
This is the real thing.

34:52.987 --> 34:56.414
People in power
truly impact our lives.

34:56.443 --> 34:58.495
You know, do they screw up?

34:58.524 --> 34:59.484
Are they perfect?

34:59.515 --> 35:00.574
Look.

35:00.604 --> 35:02.885
Stephen Green
could be president, right?

35:02.908 --> 35:05.057
And he would be a great one.

35:05.084 --> 35:07.299
Because of some
blackmailing hooker,

35:07.324 --> 35:09.758
are we gonna throw away
all of the good that he's done,

35:09.788 --> 35:12.102
all of the good
that he's gonna do?

35:12.125 --> 35:13.478
- Yeah, but still.

35:13.500 --> 35:14.689
- When it gets like this,

35:14.716 --> 35:16.189
you just got to get
revved and ready

35:16.221 --> 35:20.804
and say, "WWMD?"

35:20.828 --> 35:23.044
What would Machiavelli do?

35:31.709 --> 35:33.379
- This better work, man.

35:33.406 --> 35:34.661
- Look at it this way.

35:34.686 --> 35:36.257
If it doesn't,
I've got you back on the road

35:36.286 --> 35:37.574
to get in shape.

35:37.598 --> 35:38.657
- I'd rather be riding
down that road on my Harley.

35:38.686 --> 35:40.640
A lot more fun.
- What?

35:40.670 --> 35:41.892
- What, what?

35:41.918 --> 35:43.457
You're looking
at the new me, sweetheart.

35:43.486 --> 35:44.446
- Really?

35:44.478 --> 35:46.278
- Don't sound so skeptical.

35:46.302 --> 35:47.557
I used to be
in pretty good shape.

35:47.583 --> 35:51.173
Hey, I still am
in reasonable shape, sort of.

35:54.527 --> 35:55.619
Oh, come on.

35:55.647 --> 35:56.607
What'd you bring 'em for?

35:56.639 --> 35:57.599
Hey!

35:57.631 --> 35:58.591
- Tony Blanchard.

35:58.623 --> 36:00.522
So nice to meet you, sir.

36:00.543 --> 36:02.726
- God.
The pleasure is all mine.

36:02.752 --> 36:04.901
Tony Blanchard.

36:04.928 --> 36:06.216
I used to watch you
all the time,

36:06.240 --> 36:07.429
just in awe of your talent.

36:07.456 --> 36:08.678
Amazing.
- Thank you. Thank you.

36:08.704 --> 36:09.926
I appreciate it, sir.
Thank you.

36:09.952 --> 36:11.338
- Thanks for coming.

36:11.360 --> 36:13.379
Hey, I hear you're gonna be
the next mayor of San Diego.

36:13.408 --> 36:15.624
- Oh, trying
Hoping-

36:15.649 --> 36:17.002
- Where did you think
I heard it from?

36:18.561 --> 36:20.099
- Governor!
- Tony, Tony, over here!

36:20.129 --> 36:22.028
Just one question!
- Just a few questions.

36:22.049 --> 36:24.003
Governor, do you have
any comments on Justin Perkins

36:24.033 --> 36:26.020
releasing his medical records
later today'?

36:26.049 --> 36:28.036
- Just that it's long overdue.

36:28.065 --> 36:29.025
We both-

36:29.057 --> 36:30.050
We both owe it to the voters

36:30.081 --> 36:32.264
to be completely up front
and open.

36:32.289 --> 36:34.439
As you know, I released
my records over two weeks ago.

36:34.465 --> 36:36.484
But I think if you want
to occupy this fine house, well,

36:36.514 --> 36:37.987
the voters have a right
to know the state

36:38.018 --> 36:39.077
of their governor's health.

36:39.106 --> 36:40.579
- Is having Tony Blanchard
with you today

36:40.610 --> 36:41.570
related to the release?

36:41.602 --> 36:42.562
- Absolutely not.

36:42.594 --> 36:43.848
This is one
of the finest athletes

36:43.874 --> 36:45.031
this country has ever produced,

36:45.058 --> 36:47.939
and when Tony offered to take
time out of his busy schedule

36:47.971 --> 36:49.542
to come here,
I jumped at the chance.

36:49.570 --> 36:51.687
Not every day you get whupped
by an all-pro.

36:52.771 --> 36:54.244
- Tony, what do you think
of the governor

36:54.275 --> 36:55.464
as a jogging partner?

36:55.491 --> 36:56.931
- I think-
and let me stress "think"-

36:56.963 --> 36:58.404
that I could beat
your governor today.

36:58.435 --> 37:00.487
But if I'm in
as half as good a shape

37:00.516 --> 37:02.699
as Governor Becker is
when I hit his age,

37:02.724 --> 37:04.197
I'll be one happy guy.

37:04.227 --> 37:05.482
- "His age."
Don't believe it.

37:05.508 --> 37:07.014
Get off. Go. Go.
Go long.

37:07.043 --> 37:08.516
You want to join us?

37:08.548 --> 37:10.447
- Not in these heels,
but have a good run, Governor.

37:17.156 --> 37:19.753
- Okay, here we go.

37:19.780 --> 37:21.101
- Man, you are fast!

37:21.125 --> 37:23.340
- Not as fast as you and Tony.

37:23.364 --> 37:25.231
- Cheers to that.

37:29.574 --> 37:30.763
<i>- For state senator</i>

37:30.789 --> 37:32.524
<i>and gubernatorial candidate
Justin Perkins,</i>

37:32.550 --> 37:34.383
<i>it was a major day indeed.</i>

37:34.406 --> 37:35.726
<i>Perkins finally</i> released

37:35.749 --> 37:37.070
<i>his medical records
this morning,</i>

37:37.094 --> 37:38.283
<i>and as We've been reporting,</i>

37:38.310 --> 37:40.078
<i>they showed
an irregular heartbeat.</i>

37:40.102 --> 37:42.088
<i>All over the capital
and, in fact, the state,</i>

37:42.118 --> 37:43.951
<i>this has been topic number one.</i>

37:43.974 --> 37:46.124
<i>And earlier the Perkins campaign
made every effort</i>

37:46.150 --> 37:47.536
<i>to diminish the damage,</i>

37:47.559 --> 37:49.130
<i>including having
his personal physician</i>

37:49.158 --> 37:51.308
<i>speak to reporters here
at Mercy Hospital.</i>

37:51.335 --> 37:52.840
- <i>Thank you.
Welcome to Mercy Hospital</i>

37:52.870 --> 37:54.125
<i>I'm Dr. Ryan Johnson.</i>

37:54.151 --> 37:56.300
<i>I'm Senator Perkins'
cardiologist</i>

37:56.327 --> 37:57.931
<i>and his attending physician.</i>

37:57.959 --> 38:00.305
<i>Senator Perkins
has arrhythmia,</i>

38:00.327 --> 38:03.655
<i>a condition commonly known
as an irregular heartbeat,</i>

38:03.687 --> 38:06.765
<i>a condition shared
by millions of Americans.</i>

38:06.792 --> 38:08.712
<i>He is a former
professional athlete,</i>

38:08.743 --> 38:10.697
<i>as everybody in Kentucky knows.</i>

38:10.728 --> 38:12.594
<i>He is in superb health.</i>

38:12.616 --> 38:14.515
<i>There WIN be no
physical limitations for him</i>

38:14.536 --> 38:15.595
<i>because of this condition.</i>

38:15.624 --> 38:17.130
- <i>But what about the reports
of steroids?</i>

38:18.152 --> 38:19.571
<i>- Excuse me.
One at a time, please.</i>

38:19.593 --> 38:21.546
- Why were <i>his</i> records
not released earlier?

38:21.576 --> 38:23.147
<i>- I'll refer you
to the campaign on that.</i>

38:23.177 --> 38:24.814
<i>Again, he's in superb condition.</i>

38:24.841 --> 38:26.990
<i>His arrhythmia
will have no impact.</i>

38:27.017 --> 38:28.785
<i>- Any evidence of STDs?</i>

38:28.809 --> 38:31.122
<i>- That's an offensive question
that I Won't be answering.</i>

38:32.137 --> 38:33.196
<i>- At the same time,</i>

38:33.225 --> 38:34.796
<i>our current governor
had a different take</i>

38:34.825 --> 38:36.080
<i>on the day's events.</i>

38:36.106 --> 38:37.132
<i>- Let me begin by saying</i>

38:37.162 --> 38:38.482
<i>that the issue
of a person's health</i>

38:38.505 --> 38:40.938
<i>is far more important
than any political campaign.</i>

38:40.970 --> 38:43.949
<i>But this is really
about the public trust.</i>

38:43.978 --> 38:45.102
<i>If the public can't trust you</i>

38:45.130 --> 38:46.734
<i>to be up front
about your own health,</i>

38:46.762 --> 38:49.294
<i>then how can they trust you
with the health of our state?</i>

38:49.322 --> 38:51.374
<i>Of course, Sophia and I
WIN have state Senator Perkins</i>

38:51.402 --> 38:53.322
<i>in our hearts
and our prayers tonight,</i>

38:53.354 --> 38:54.478
<i>when it comes to his overcoming</i>

38:54.507 --> 38:57.617
<i>this very serious
health prob/em.</i>

38:57.643 --> 38:59.313
<i>think if you want to occupy
this fine house,</i>

38:59.339 --> 39:01.041
<i>web', the voters have</i> a <i>right
to know the state</i>

39:01.067 --> 39:02.093
<i>of their governor's health.</i>

39:02.123 --> 39:03.312
<i>- And later in the day,</i>

39:03.339 --> 39:05.685
<i>Tony Blanchard spoke
to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd</i>

39:05.707 --> 39:07.180
<i>at Le/and Middle School</i>

39:07.211 --> 39:09.525
<i>and then afterward
signed autographs.</i>

39:09.548 --> 39:12.691
<i>And for those lucky kids
getting to meet our governor's</i>

39:12.715 --> 39:14.418
ah'-pro jogging partner,

39:14.444 --> 39:17.074
<i>it'll be a day they'll remember
their entire lives.</i>

39:17.100 --> 39:18.127
- <i>Lucky.</i>

39:18.156 --> 39:19.597
<i>- And We caught up
with Governor Becker</i>

39:19.628 --> 39:21.428
<i>as he attended
a talk and book signing</i>

39:21.452 --> 39:23.318
<i>for football superstar
Tony Blanchard</i>

39:23.340 --> 39:25.970
<i>at the Pine Valley Mall.</i>

39:26.989 --> 39:28.407
<i>- Some rush there, Governor!</i>

39:28.428 --> 39:30.513
- <i>Well, I promised I'd come
hear Tony speak.</i>

39:30.541 --> 39:32.724
<i>He's</i> a <i>good friend.
I'm running</i> a <i>little fate</i>

39:32.749 --> 39:34.255
<i>You know, like everyone else
in America,</i>

39:34.285 --> 39:36.915
<i>{cheered when he</i> made <i>that
unbelievable Super Bow! run,</i>

39:36.941 --> 39:38.895
<i>and I'm cheering for him now
that he's setting</i>

39:38.926 --> 39:41.075
<i>such a fine example
for Kentucky's children.</i>

39:41.102 --> 39:43.797
<i>- Thanks for your time,
Governor.</i>

39:43.822 --> 39:44.946
- Wow.

39:44.974 --> 39:46.807
- It's a Picasso.

39:46.830 --> 39:48.467
- Sure.
A Picasso.

39:48.494 --> 39:50.131
- The escalator was genius.

39:50.158 --> 39:52.177
- And you had the cameras
everywhere they needed to be.

39:52.207 --> 39:53.265
Just a great job.

39:53.294 --> 39:54.386
It's great.
It's a great job.

39:54.414 --> 39:55.506
- Thanks, sweetheart.

39:55.535 --> 39:56.789
I owe you.

39:59.406 --> 40:02.134
Well, that is it for jogging!

40:02.159 --> 40:03.665
- No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

40:03.695 --> 40:05.910
Once a week every week
till the campaign ends.

40:05.935 --> 40:07.190
- What?

40:07.215 --> 40:08.372
Can't you just release
some photos or something?

40:15.567 --> 40:16.626
- Just one, 'cause you and I

40:16.656 --> 40:17.977
are going
to the Seville Bar later.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.735
- The wine bar?
- The wine bar.

40:19.760 --> 40:21.298
- Seems a little upscale
for you.

40:21.328 --> 40:22.582
- Upscale?
Really? Why?

40:22.608 --> 40:23.568
What do you mean?

40:23.600 --> 40:24.560
- The girls
keep their clothes on,

40:24.593 --> 40:25.847
for one thing.
- Don't be so sure.

40:26.640 --> 40:29.205
There's this waitress there
named Lara.

40:29.233 --> 40:31.797
Oh, my God.
She's absolutely gorgeous.

40:31.825 --> 40:32.982
- Is she the new thing?

40:33.009 --> 40:34.482
- Well, actually,
she's more your type.

40:34.513 --> 40:35.898
- Why are we going
to the Seville?

40:35.921 --> 40:38.038
- Okay, Lara,

40:38.065 --> 40:41.939
who is becoming very tight
with myself,

40:41.970 --> 40:44.796
has agreed
to show some pictures.

40:44.818 --> 40:45.910
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:45.937 --> 40:47.956
- Clothed?
- Kind of sort of.

40:47.986 --> 40:48.946
- Regarding?

40:48.978 --> 40:52.186
- Regarding bite marks

40:52.210 --> 40:55.571
of a certain set of teeth

40:55.602 --> 40:59.160
from a person of interest

40:59.186 --> 41:03.606
regarding a certain fleshy part
of the body.

41:03.635 --> 41:05.304
- What are you still doing here?

41:05.331 --> 41:06.390
- You're here, boss.

41:06.419 --> 41:08.568
Anyway I love this spot.

41:08.595 --> 41:09.719
- Love it?

41:09.747 --> 41:11.100
- Swiftboat the swiftboaters,
dude.

41:11.123 --> 41:12.083
Want to see it?

41:12.115 --> 41:13.337
It's still rough in my voice,

41:13.364 --> 41:15.164
but we'll get Don in here
tomorrow if you like it.

41:15.188 --> 41:16.377
- Let's have a look.

41:17.652 --> 41:18.841
<i>- Imagine this."</i>

41:18.868 --> 41:20.287
<i>You attend Annapolis.</i>

41:20.308 --> 41:22.141
<i>You play football there</i>

41:22.164 --> 41:23.833
<i>and did so well,
you had the chance</i>

41:23.860 --> 41:25.693
<i>to go on
and play professionally.</i>

41:25.716 --> 41:28.575
<i>But instead,
you turned down the NFL</i>

41:28.596 --> 41:30.779
<i>and went to fight
for your country.</i>

41:30.804 --> 41:33.369
<i>Your leadership was recognized
with the Navy Cross,</i>

41:33.397 --> 41:35.066
<i>and then, years later,</i>

41:35.093 --> 41:36.730
<i>someone begins knocking
on the doors</i>

41:36.757 --> 41:38.394
of those who served with you.

41:38.421 --> 41:41.400
<i>- They came into my house
and started asking me questions</i>

41:41.429 --> 41:42.902
<i>about Stephen Green</i>

41:42.933 --> 41:44.504
<i>and all the bad things
he had done</i>

41:44.534 --> 41:46.007
<i>when he was a lieutenant
in my unit.</i>

41:46.038 --> 41:47.511
<i>Bad things?</i>

41:47.541 --> 41:49.244
<i>There Wasn't an officer
in all of Afghanistan</i>

41:49.270 --> 41:50.394
<i>as respected as he Was.</i>

41:50.422 --> 41:52.026
<i>- Yeah, they asked me
the same thing,</i>

41:52.054 --> 41:53.407
<i>and every time
I said something good</i>

41:53.430 --> 41:55.831
<i>about Stephen Green,
they Wanted something bad.</i>

41:55.863 --> 41:57.281
<i>This is the guy
who put his body</i>

41:57.302 --> 41:58.656
<i>between us and the Taliban.</i>

41:58.679 --> 42:00.414
<i>And what they're doing
is un-American.</i>

42:00.439 --> 42:02.654
<i>So I asked them
to please leave my house.</i>

42:02.679 --> 42:04.828
<i>Far too many of our friends
are buried here,</i>

42:04.855 --> 42:07.201
<i>and it shocks me that instead
of honoring those</i>

<i>that fought and died

42:09.079 --> 42:11.228
<i>Duff Campbell

Yeah!

42:48.633 --> 42:50.204
- Is that Stephen Green stuff?

42:50.234 --> 42:51.969
- No, it's not that.

42:53.338 --> 42:56.033
Read.

42:56.058 --> 42:57.978
- "I first aspired
to go to medical school

42:58.011 --> 42:59.964
"when, as a small child,
I would accompany my uncle

42:59.994 --> 43:02.045
"to his small pediatric clinic
in Seoul,

43:02.074 --> 43:03.395
where he was a beloved figure."

43:03.419 --> 43:04.478
What is this?

43:04.507 --> 43:06.012
- Well, that's my life,

43:06.043 --> 43:07.614
the cliché of my life.

43:07.643 --> 43:09.727
It's what you do when you're
first-generation American

43:09.755 --> 43:11.741
and your parents
run a fruit market

43:11.771 --> 43:13.473
in the shadows of Berkeley.

43:13.499 --> 43:15.136
They work, like, 15 hours a day,

43:15.163 --> 43:16.669
just so that, one day,

43:16.700 --> 43:18.849
you can go
to that very same college.

43:18.876 --> 43:21.189
- And become a surgeon.

43:21.211 --> 43:22.237
- Not just that.

43:22.268 --> 43:24.647
I could be
an internationally renowned

43:24.668 --> 43:28.574
concert pianist or a professor
in electrical engineering.

43:30.844 --> 43:32.415
- You ended up here.

43:34.460 --> 43:38.182
- I thought it was a good thing.

43:38.205 --> 43:41.762
- Well, I can't offer you
a lab coat, but...

43:41.789 --> 43:44.321
the truth of it is, is that,

43:44.350 --> 43:47.525
as fucked up as things are
and as bad as they may seem,

43:47.549 --> 43:48.706
that most people really believe

43:48.734 --> 43:50.883
that leaders
can make a difference.

43:50.910 --> 43:52.481
If you're helping
great leaders get in,

43:52.510 --> 43:54.594
aren't you doing a service?

43:54.622 --> 43:56.640
- Yeah.

43:56.670 --> 43:58.754
I know, but-

43:58.782 --> 44:01.543
- It doesn't fit the narrative,

44:01.566 --> 44:05.059
the cliché that we work with
every day.

44:05.086 --> 44:09.124
- Like being the daughter
of outrageously hardworking

44:09.151 --> 44:10.537
Korean immigrants,

44:10.559 --> 44:15.328
who one day goes off
to Johns Hopkins Medical School.

44:15.359 --> 44:16.800
- You broke out of your cliché.

44:16.832 --> 44:21.186
I think that's a great thing.

44:21.216 --> 44:24.260
Look.

44:24.288 --> 44:26.568
On election night,

44:26.592 --> 44:29.419
when your guy goes over the top,

44:29.440 --> 44:34.983
the feeling
is un-fucking-believable.

44:35.008 --> 44:39.330
It courses through your veins
like nothing else.

44:39.361 --> 44:41.958
- See, that's what I want to do.
I...

44:41.985 --> 44:42.945
I want to do what you do.

44:42.977 --> 44:44.363
I want to make kings and queens,

44:44.385 --> 44:46.022
but I can't do what you do.

44:46.049 --> 44:47.009
- You can.

44:47.041 --> 44:48.908
And you'll be better than I am.

44:48.929 --> 44:50.729
- No.

44:52.642 --> 44:55.501
I can't.

44:55.522 --> 44:58.403
- Then you'll be a great doctor,

44:58.434 --> 45:01.445
a Penelope-great doctor.

45:02.467 --> 45:04.202
I'll write a letter
of recommendation for you.

45:04.227 --> 45:06.311
I'll get the Vice President
of the United States

45:06.338 --> 45:08.652
to write a letter
of recommendation for you.

45:10.243 --> 45:12.426
- I'm sorry,

45:12.451 --> 45:14.251
but thank you.

45:19.236 --> 45:20.196
Thanks.

45:31.652 --> 45:33.322
- That photo probably cost him
five grand.

45:36.613 --> 45:38.445
- For you.
- You're kidding.

45:38.468 --> 45:39.723
- Not at all.

45:39.749 --> 45:41.167
I go to meetings all the time.

45:41.188 --> 45:42.574
All I get from them
is a headache.

45:42.596 --> 45:44.070
Now at least
you'll have something good

45:44.101 --> 45:45.225
to remember our little talk by.

45:45.253 --> 45:46.606
Sit.

45:46.629 --> 45:48.714
- Well, hopefully we'll be able
to provide a happy memory

45:48.741 --> 45:49.931
of our talk.

45:49.957 --> 45:52.719
- We can all use them,
or more to the point, uh,

45:52.742 --> 45:54.859
your man Stephen Green can.

45:54.885 --> 45:56.555
Not happy times
for our junior senator,

45:56.582 --> 45:57.542
huh, Paul?

45:57.574 --> 45:58.796
- Well, I don't know about that.

45:58.822 --> 46:00.688
He's up nine points
in the latest field poll.

46:00.710 --> 46:02.696
He's got 16 major
newspaper endorsements,

46:02.726 --> 46:05.007
and more importantly, he's doing
great things for the state.

46:05.030 --> 46:06.186
- Spare me.

46:06.214 --> 46:09.128
We're in a no-spin zone
here, Paul.

46:09.159 --> 46:11.079
We both know that he's got
a giant bull's-eye

46:11.110 --> 46:12.584
painted on his back,

46:12.614 --> 46:15.855
and I have a huge fucking archer
standing right behind him.

46:15.879 --> 46:17.484
- But you haven't fired.

46:17.511 --> 46:19.694
- I wanted to see what you had
to offer first.

46:19.719 --> 46:21.869
- You're interested
in our story?

46:21.896 --> 46:22.856
- Of course.

46:22.887 --> 46:24.241
We're fair.
We're balanced.

46:24.264 --> 46:26.217
We're a news organization,
for Christ's sake, Paul.

46:26.248 --> 46:27.601
Come on.

46:27.623 --> 46:31.530
Well, I'm not sure that I agree
with any of those claims.

46:31.560 --> 46:34.604
Our story is
that there is no story.

46:34.632 --> 46:35.789
Nada.

46:35.816 --> 46:36.973
Nothing.

46:37.001 --> 46:38.222
Zilch.
- Mm.

46:38.248 --> 46:40.398
That's too bad.

46:40.425 --> 46:43.469
Then I guess we'll be hearing
a lot more from Miss Shearson.

46:43.497 --> 46:46.029
It's horrible,
what that poor girl experienced.

46:46.056 --> 46:48.621
- Something tells me
she's gonna be just fine.

46:48.649 --> 46:52.076
I was hoping you would do me
a personal favor.

46:52.105 --> 46:54.735
I'd like you to kill any stories
with her ridiculous claims.

46:54.761 --> 46:56.878
You must be joking.

46:56.906 --> 46:58.226
- Not at all.

46:58.249 --> 47:00.082
You see, I've recently
become aware of a waitress

47:00.105 --> 47:02.288
at the Seville Wine Bar
named Lara.

47:02.314 --> 47:04.911
She tells
a pretty incredible story.

47:04.938 --> 47:06.357
- I've never been there.

47:06.378 --> 47:08.495
- The story is, guy comes in,
is drinking.

47:08.522 --> 47:10.771
He's interested.

47:10.794 --> 47:14.068
He bites her ass in the bar.

47:14.091 --> 47:15.509
Now, it's-it's-

47:15.531 --> 47:18.095
That was my reaction as well.

47:18.123 --> 47:20.404
So she tells her friend,
who also works there,

47:20.427 --> 47:25.076
and it turns out the same guy
did the same thing to her too.

47:25.099 --> 47:26.573
- Really?

47:26.603 --> 47:28.142
- And there's more.

47:28.172 --> 47:29.426
Apparently, the guy is so rich-

47:29.452 --> 47:31.853
he was brought in to run
a television station

47:31.884 --> 47:33.172
or something-

47:33.196 --> 47:35.095
that both girls,
looking for opportunities,

47:35.116 --> 47:37.550
as people are wont to do
in these tough economic times,

47:37.580 --> 47:38.573
take pictures...

47:38.605 --> 47:40.242
- Hmm.
- Of the bite marks

47:40.269 --> 47:42.102
and what this guy did to them.

47:42.125 --> 47:43.925
I thought you'd want to know.

47:46.765 --> 47:47.987
I can have this story
up on Gawker

47:48.012 --> 47:49.301
before I get back to my office.

47:49.325 --> 47:51.758
Most of the major media outlets
will probably pick it up,

47:51.789 --> 47:53.110
certainly The Chronicle,

47:53.133 --> 47:55.633
maybe some other
television stations.

47:55.661 --> 47:58.161
But I'm guessing

47:58.189 --> 47:59.510
not here?

48:01.646 --> 48:03.665
- Probably not.

48:03.694 --> 48:07.121
This has been great.

48:07.150 --> 48:08.689
Paul, best.

48:08.719 --> 48:09.679
- Thanks for the mug.

48:09.710 --> 48:11.096
- Absolutely.

48:16.335 --> 48:17.589
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

48:17.615 --> 48:19.001
- I'd like you to meet Angela.

48:19.023 --> 48:21.523
- Hi.
Sorry, I was working all day.

48:21.551 --> 48:23.024
And Dimitris...
- What?

48:23.055 --> 48:24.725
- He spent, like,
half your company's budget

48:24.751 --> 48:25.777
on me tonight.

48:25.807 --> 48:27.095
- Just a few drinks.

48:27.119 --> 48:29.302
This girl can go toe-to-toe
with the best.

48:29.328 --> 48:30.419
- You look familiar.

48:30.448 --> 48:32.019
- Very good, Jimmy!

48:32.048 --> 48:33.521
There's something
in between your ears

48:33.552 --> 48:34.610
besides unlistenable punk.

48:34.640 --> 48:37.554
Very nice.
Okay, now tell me from where.

48:37.584 --> 48:40.530
And Paul's disqualified.

48:40.560 --> 48:42.360
Oh, come on.
Nobody?

48:42.384 --> 48:44.435
- The Tawny video.
Orange bikini.

48:44.464 --> 48:45.523
- That's my girl.

48:45.553 --> 48:46.841
- It was red,
and it's my favorite.

48:46.865 --> 48:48.022
- Red, blue, yellow.
Who cares?

48:48.048 --> 48:49.619
You looked
that fucking beautiful in it.

48:49.649 --> 48:51.188
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

48:51.217 --> 48:53.334
- Okay, Dimitris says
that you are a proud graduate

48:53.361 --> 48:56.405
of the Bay City School
of Massage Therapy?

48:56.433 --> 48:57.557
- She is the all-star graduate.

48:57.585 --> 48:59.025
She-she won, like,
the what?

48:59.057 --> 49:01.240
The President's Award
or the Iron Cross or something.

49:01.266 --> 49:02.968
- Hey.
Hi, I'm sorry.

49:02.993 --> 49:04.215
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry I'm late.

49:04.242 --> 49:05.595
- Oh, my God!

49:05.618 --> 49:06.611
I watch you all the time!

49:06.642 --> 49:08.060
You're Peaches O'Dell!

49:08.082 --> 49:10.101
You're the best!

49:10.130 --> 49:11.701
- Thank you.
You are very sweet to say that.

49:11.731 --> 49:12.789
- Oh, wow!

49:12.818 --> 49:14.488
All I ever wanted to be
when I was a little girl

49:14.514 --> 49:15.932
was a TV reporter,
and you did it.

49:15.954 --> 49:17.079
Look at you.
And you're like-

49:17.106 --> 49:18.580
Wow, you're here,
like, right here

49:18.610 --> 49:20.597
on the couch beside me!

49:20.626 --> 49:22.427
- Angela went to school
with Tawny.

49:22.450 --> 49:24.600
- Oh?
What is she like?

49:24.627 --> 49:25.783
- Mean.
- Oh.

49:25.811 --> 49:27.033
- Well, she's not always,

49:27.059 --> 49:28.892
but when she drinks,
she gets that way.

49:28.915 --> 49:30.236
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

49:30.259 --> 49:32.638
- Um, pretty, tell her what you
uh, told me about the Baja.

49:32.659 --> 49:33.619
- Oh, right.
Yeah.

49:33.652 --> 49:34.711
We were out drinking and-

49:34.739 --> 49:36.028
Well, something she did
a lot of.

49:36.052 --> 49:37.557
Well, but to be honest,
kind of something

49:37.588 --> 49:38.647
I did a lot of too.

49:38.676 --> 49:40.542
And we'd had
this crazy happy hour

49:40.564 --> 49:42.518
where we did
way too many tequila shots

49:42.548 --> 49:44.218
at the Baja Cantina.

49:44.244 --> 49:45.204
You know it?
In Venice?

49:45.236 --> 49:46.196
- I don't.
- It's awesome!

49:46.229 --> 49:47.517
<i>-</i> Okay-

49:47.541 --> 49:49.919
- So when we left, we passed
this rollerblading place,

49:49.940 --> 49:52.156
and she picked up a pair
of knee pads,

49:52.181 --> 49:54.713
and she said, "These guys,

49:54.741 --> 49:56.443
"a ticket to Washington,

49:56.469 --> 49:58.269
"and this body,

49:58.293 --> 49:59.963
and I'm golden."

49:59.989 --> 50:01.080
- Nice.

50:01.109 --> 50:02.844
- But how'd she end up
in Sacramento?

50:02.869 --> 50:05.979
- Oh, she had some thing
with, like, a politician dude

50:06.005 --> 50:07.610
that she thought
was gonna go, like, a week,

50:07.638 --> 50:10.464
but then he got elected
Speaker of the Assembly.

50:10.486 --> 50:12.091
And when he moved
his whole family up there,

50:12.118 --> 50:14.496
then he brought her up too.

50:14.518 --> 50:15.642
- Wow.

50:15.670 --> 50:17.275
- I kind of didn't
think much about it.

50:17.303 --> 50:18.776
I didn't think
it was that big of a deal.

50:18.806 --> 50:20.793
But then Dimitris...
- Yes, I did.

50:20.822 --> 50:23.965
- Found me,
and it all came back.

50:23.990 --> 50:25.595
Dimitris found me.

50:27.703 --> 50:30.562
- Would you be willing
to tell this story on camera?

50:30.583 --> 50:31.969
- You want me?

50:31.991 --> 50:34.010
Peaches O'Dell, you want to-
you want to interview me?

50:34.040 --> 50:35.000
- Yep.
- Hell yeah!

50:35.032 --> 50:35.992
Yeah!
Yes.

50:36.023 --> 50:37.890
Absolutely, I would, yes.

50:37.912 --> 50:39.450
- Thank you.

50:39.480 --> 50:40.920
Thank you.

50:40.952 --> 50:43.549
This is a story
that needs to be heard.

50:43.576 --> 50:44.897
- Yeah.

50:44.920 --> 50:46.044
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

50:47.385 --> 50:48.923
Yes.

50:48.952 --> 50:51.069
- Just keeping the media happy.

50:51.096 --> 50:52.057
- Fat and happy.
- Fat?

50:52.088 --> 50:53.147
I don't think so.

50:53.177 --> 50:55.490
- Just be glad
you're not on camera.

50:55.513 --> 50:56.539
Do you know what I think?

50:56.569 --> 50:58.948
- Hmm?
- I think you're running a con.

50:58.969 --> 51:01.217
- I bring you
to the best sushi restaurant

51:01.241 --> 51:04.253
in the town, and this is
the thanks I get?

51:04.281 --> 51:06.082
- Are you?

51:06.105 --> 51:09.019
- No hidden microphones
or secret cameras?

51:09.050 --> 51:10.468
- Want to pat me down?

51:10.490 --> 51:12.225
- Absolutely.
- No.

51:12.249 --> 51:15.011
- I think we're surrounded
by the con.

51:15.034 --> 51:17.118
"Tax breaks for the rich
will help the poor.

51:17.147 --> 51:18.849
"Diet drinks will help you
lose 20 pounds,

51:18.874 --> 51:20.511
"and you snag the man
of your dreams.

51:20.538 --> 51:22.208
"Paul, please give us
the inside scoop,

51:22.235 --> 51:24.635
and we promise we'll treat
your guy fairly in the story."

51:24.667 --> 51:25.726
- "The guy you elect today

51:25.755 --> 51:28.548
will change
your world tomorrow

51:28.571 --> 51:30.109
- You know, the first race
I ever ran

51:30.139 --> 51:32.965
was for my dad's
childhood friend, Ron Gerace.

51:32.987 --> 51:34.111
Great guy.

51:34.139 --> 51:35.710
Just very little
formal education,

51:35.740 --> 51:37.726
but smart and honest.

51:37.756 --> 51:40.386
He was running for mayor
against a corrupt asshole

51:40.412 --> 51:43.074
who had been in office forever
and was considered unbeatable.

51:43.100 --> 51:46.046
I was, like, 20
and had no experience

51:46.076 --> 51:48.160
but a lot of energy
and a lot of ideas.

51:48.188 --> 51:50.087
But really,
I didn't know shit.

51:50.108 --> 51:51.101
- Like now.

51:51.132 --> 51:52.867
More so.

51:52.892 --> 51:56.898
- But what I did know was
that if I worked hard enough

51:56.924 --> 51:59.686
and a miracle happened
and Ron got in,

51:59.709 --> 52:04.641
that the world would somehow
be a better place.

52:04.669 --> 52:06.274
- Did he win?

52:06.302 --> 52:07.720
- He killed.

52:07.741 --> 52:10.404
He was the best mayor
Minneapolis ever had.

52:10.430 --> 52:13.573
So, as corny as it sounds,

52:13.598 --> 52:15.136
if you believe,

52:15.166 --> 52:16.322
it happens.

52:16.350 --> 52:19.177
- So what do you believe?

52:19.198 --> 52:22.308
- That if you get
the right guy elected,

52:22.334 --> 52:25.444
you are so far into a place

52:25.470 --> 52:28.198
that is beyond
running a campaign

52:28.223 --> 52:29.641
or reporting the news.

52:29.662 --> 52:33.285
You are making the news.

52:33.311 --> 52:37.381
And that's what we dream of.

52:37.407 --> 52:41.445
So do I believe?

52:41.472 --> 52:44.233
Yeah.

52:44.256 --> 52:45.544
I believe.

52:48.256 --> 52:49.216
- Conning me?

52:49.248 --> 52:50.569
I am not.

52:50.592 --> 52:51.978
It's the truth.
Straight up.

52:52.000 --> 52:52.960
Swear to God.

52:52.993 --> 52:54.564
Oh, yeah, right.

52:54.592 --> 52:56.098
That'll be the day.

52:56.129 --> 52:57.155
That-That is your god.

52:57.185 --> 52:58.887
You believe in the god
of BlackBerry.

52:58.913 --> 53:00.299
- Please, it's only a tool.

53:00.321 --> 53:01.827
- Right.
Then don't answer it.

53:01.857 --> 53:02.948
I dare you.

53:02.977 --> 53:04.548
You love that thing
more than life itself.

53:04.577 --> 53:06.377
- Well, that would be crazy.

53:09.762 --> 53:10.722
What are you-

53:10.753 --> 53:12.107
What the fuck?

53:13.954 --> 53:15.787
- It's merely a tool.

53:15.810 --> 53:18.309
- What?
- We did a sweeps piece on this.

53:18.338 --> 53:19.626
I know it looks really weird,

53:19.650 --> 53:21.570
but the rice
will bring it back to life.

53:21.602 --> 53:22.856
- It better.

53:22.882 --> 53:23.842
- Hmm.

53:23.875 --> 53:25.512
- Oh, you have some right there.

53:25.539 --> 53:26.499
There you go.

53:30.019 --> 53:32.332
- I'm not too much
of a vapid beauty queen?

53:32.355 --> 53:33.577
- I don't know.

53:33.603 --> 53:35.403
I'm not too much
of an over educated,

53:35.427 --> 53:37.643
BlackBerry-addicted guy
running a con?

53:37.668 --> 53:39.851
<i>- I Come bring me home <i></i></i>

53:39.876 --> 53:45.157
<i>It's been a long time coming <i></i></i>

53:54.148 --> 53:55.981
- Hello.
- Paul, where the hell are you?

53:56.005 --> 53:59.082
I've been emailing you
every two minutes!

53:59.108 --> 54:00.330
- You know, I had a long night.

54:00.357 --> 54:01.579
I had meeting after meeting,

54:01.605 --> 54:03.143
and then I just lost track
of time.

54:03.173 --> 54:06.032
And then I had a BlackBerry
technical malfunction.

54:06.053 --> 54:07.788
It works!
Nothing.

54:07.813 --> 54:09.002
Did you send it to the iPhone?

54:09.029 --> 54:10.470
I'll look at it there.
Okay.

54:12.166 --> 54:15.406
- <i>And we just learned tonight
that</i> a <i>focal man claims</i>

54:15.429 --> 54:18.059
<i>his girlfriend is having
an ongoing affair</i>

54:18.086 --> 54:19.407
<i>with the governor.</i>

54:19.430 --> 54:22.441
<i>And he claims he has her diary
to prove it.</i>

54:22.470 --> 54:25.198
<i>- Sounds like this is one
explosive story.</i>

54:25.222 --> 54:26.695
<i>And what was
the governor's response?</i>

54:26.727 --> 54:27.916
<i>- well, nothing yet, Dani.</i>

54:27.943 --> 54:31.151
<i>And to be fair,
this just came in but our-</i>

54:31.175 --> 54:32.943
- This is terrible.
We need to get down there.

54:32.967 --> 54:34.287
What's the first flight
we can get?

54:34.311 --> 54:35.817
- Oh, God.

54:35.847 --> 54:38.095
- Fuck a duck.

54:38.119 --> 54:39.985
- No, honey.
You fucked an intern.

54:40.007 --> 54:41.197
That's why we're all here.

54:41.224 --> 54:43.919
- Has anyone actually
seen the diary?

54:43.944 --> 54:45.864
- Hey, darlin'.

54:52.648 --> 54:54.154
- Do we even know
that the diary's real?

54:54.184 --> 54:55.438
- We don't,

54:55.464 --> 54:57.331
and if it's electronic,
that would be a huge break.

54:57.353 --> 54:58.313
Is she a nutter?

54:58.344 --> 54:59.818
- No. No.
She's solid.

54:59.848 --> 55:00.808
I like her.

55:00.841 --> 55:03.089
I mean, I-
You know what I mean.

55:03.113 --> 55:05.579
- Paul, as much as I want
to violently disagree

55:05.609 --> 55:07.529
with every single thing,
every word,

55:07.561 --> 55:10.606
every syllable
my alleged husband says,

55:10.633 --> 55:12.238
that one thing is true.

55:12.265 --> 55:14.000
She's the daughter
of one of our professors.

55:14.026 --> 55:15.248
- And?

55:15.274 --> 55:17.325
- And you're not gonna
Kobe Bryant her,

55:17.354 --> 55:19.602
turn her into some sort of
predatory slut.

55:19.626 --> 55:21.546
- Well, we're just
getting started here.

55:21.578 --> 55:23.662
- She may not be perfect
or even completely innocent.

55:23.690 --> 55:24.814
I have no idea.

55:24.843 --> 55:26.097
But you are not gonna trash her.

55:26.122 --> 55:28.076
- Look, honey-
- No, honey.

55:28.106 --> 55:29.361
You guys trash her,

55:29.387 --> 55:31.504
and I won't be there
to do my stand-by-my-man thing,

55:31.530 --> 55:33.746
and then you're really fucked.

55:33.771 --> 55:35.059
Honey.

55:43.115 --> 55:45.974
So what do we do?

55:45.996 --> 55:53.591
- Sweetie, we have entered
a deep, dark, unspinnable place.

55:56.492 --> 55:59.885
<i>II'</i>

56:15.822 --> 56:17.076
- Ah.

56:17.101 --> 56:19.218
It's nice to know no matter
how bad things get,

56:19.246 --> 56:21.843
there's gonna be a naked girl
on a pole to cheer you right up.

56:21.870 --> 56:23.987
- Try many, many girls.
Hi.

56:24.013 --> 56:25.519
You object?

56:25.550 --> 56:27.634
- Enjoying.
- That's my girl.

56:27.662 --> 56:29.266
There's a gentleman
sitting across the way

56:29.294 --> 56:30.680
in a football jersey.

56:30.702 --> 56:31.728
That's the boyfriend.

56:31.758 --> 56:33.363
His name is Junior,
believe it or not,

56:33.391 --> 56:35.257
Junior Conway.

56:35.279 --> 56:36.981
He's here all the time.

56:37.006 --> 56:38.709
- Don't get me wrong.
I could stay here all day.

56:38.735 --> 56:40.121
But you got to do better
than that.

56:40.143 --> 56:42.292
- Patience, my friend.
Patience.

56:42.319 --> 56:43.279
- Junior?

56:43.312 --> 56:44.501
He sells coke to everyone:

56:44.528 --> 56:45.848
girls, customers.

56:45.871 --> 56:48.250
Shit, he probably even sells it
to the cops that come in.

56:48.271 --> 56:50.672
- Okay, what about her?

56:52.592 --> 56:54.840
- I did see her once.

56:54.864 --> 56:58.225
- And did Junior there
provide the refreshments?

56:58.256 --> 57:00.123
- Yes and no.

57:00.144 --> 57:01.333
- What do you mean?

57:01.360 --> 57:03.761
- One time we were all,
like, three girls from the club,

57:03.792 --> 57:05.146
Junior and a couple
of his buddies-

57:05.169 --> 57:06.969
we were at a frat party
in Lexington

57:06.993 --> 57:08.760
doing a bunch
of Junior's blow,

57:08.784 --> 57:10.422
and he kept telling her
to do it.

57:10.449 --> 57:12.020
- But she didn't want to do it?

57:12.049 --> 57:14.101
- Not really.
She kept saying no.

57:14.129 --> 57:15.188
Junior wouldn't let it go.

57:15.217 --> 57:16.177
He was buggin' on it,

57:16.210 --> 57:17.399
and he kept saying
over and over,

57:17.425 --> 57:19.509
"Are you 22 or 62?
Just go for it."

57:19.538 --> 57:21.011
- Did she do any?

57:21.042 --> 57:22.264
- She did a tiny bit
of the blow,

57:22.289 --> 57:24.538
and then, five minutes later,
she went home alone.

57:24.562 --> 57:25.947
I mean, if I had to guess,

57:25.970 --> 57:27.890
that was probably the beginning
of the end.

57:27.922 --> 57:29.363
I mean, they're just
so different.

57:29.394 --> 57:31.130
- Did you ever see her
do the drugs again?

57:31.154 --> 57:33.654
- I mean, I barely saw her
do it that once.

57:37.555 --> 57:38.908
- It's go time.

57:38.931 --> 57:41.877
It's do or die,
but it's your call.

57:41.907 --> 57:44.602
- Sophia's gonna go batshit.

57:44.627 --> 57:46.711
- You should look at this.

57:46.739 --> 57:48.343
They've made a major ad buy.

57:48.371 --> 57:49.398
It's about to hit.

57:49.427 --> 57:52.308
A guy at the station
slipped it to me.

57:52.339 --> 57:53.594
<i>- Larry Becker Wants us</i>

57:53.620 --> 57:55.420

as governor</i>

57:55.444 --> 57:58.074
<i>so he can A." continue

<i>or C: convince you that a girl

58:07.221 --> 58:09.654
<i>really isn't
the first mistress of Kentucky</i>

58:09.684 --> 58:12.412
<i>so he can have four more years

58:12.437 --> 58:13.823
<i>Is this really the kind of man</i>

58:13.845 --> 58:15.678
<i>you would trust
with your daughter?</i>

58:15.701 --> 58:17.207
<i>Or your state?</i>

58:17.237 --> 58:19.104
<i>- I'm Justin Perkins.</i>

58:19.125 --> 58:21.820
<i>And I'll restore dignity back
to the governor's office.</i>

58:21.846 --> 58:24.956
- I don't know
where to fucking start.

58:24.981 --> 58:27.546
And by the way, since when is 22
just out of high school?

58:27.574 --> 58:30.301
- She could have been 32.
They'd have used the same line.

58:32.086 --> 58:33.657
- Know what's weird?

58:35.318 --> 58:38.013
She's a good girl, really.

58:38.038 --> 58:39.959
- Well, the boyfriend's
asshole central.

58:39.990 --> 58:42.009
Dimitris already got him
getting a 100k payday

58:42.039 --> 58:43.479
and double that if you go down.

58:43.511 --> 58:46.938
- Oh, fuck me.

58:46.967 --> 58:48.866
Six months ago, the only way
I could lose this thing

58:48.887 --> 58:51.549
was to get caught in bed
with a dead girl or a live boy.

58:51.575 --> 58:53.856
Now this.

58:55.832 --> 58:57.054
- So what's it gonna be?

58:57.079 --> 58:58.782
Sonny or Michael?

59:01.624 --> 59:03.675
- Sonny.

59:03.704 --> 59:05.570
Go nuclear.

59:05.592 --> 59:07.644
- Bloggers.
- Yep.

59:07.673 --> 59:08.895
- TV reporters.
- Yeah.

59:08.921 --> 59:11.005
- Talk show bloviaters
and newspapers.

59:11.033 --> 59:12.025
All of them.
- Newspapers.

59:12.057 --> 59:14.011
- City, community, college.

59:14.041 --> 59:15.100
I want all of our big guys,

59:15.129 --> 59:16.733
and I want every newbie
looking to break in.

59:16.761 --> 59:17.885
- Okay, they're set up.
Got it.

59:17.913 --> 59:19.997
Take this on deep background.

59:20.025 --> 59:20.985
Just follow the money.

59:21.018 --> 59:22.491
It leads straight back
to Perkins.

59:22.522 --> 59:25.283
Listen, I'm doing you this favor
so you don't get beat again.

59:25.306 --> 59:26.812
You did all the legwork,

59:26.841 --> 59:29.471
but you definitely did not
get this information from us.

59:29.498 --> 59:31.484
Now, this story is yours
and yours only,

59:31.514 --> 59:34.209
but remember, whatever you do,
don't source back to us.

59:34.234 --> 59:35.391
And remember, this is embargoed

59:35.419 --> 59:36.924
for a 7:00 a.m.
online posting tomorrow.

59:36.954 --> 59:38.395
- Yeah, yeah,
but you're not giving this

59:38.426 --> 59:39.386
to anyone else, right?

59:39.418 --> 59:40.378
Because, let's face it.

59:40.411 --> 59:42.048
My blog
drives the cable coverage.

59:42.075 --> 59:43.777
All the insiders come
to us first.

59:43.803 --> 59:45.986
- No, absolutely.
You get the first pop.

59:46.011 --> 59:47.233
- This is gonna be more
than a pop.

59:47.259 --> 59:49.540
When I heard about this story,
I had a blogasm.

59:49.563 --> 59:50.818
- Now you get multiple blogasms.

59:52.411 --> 59:56.034
- Perkins and his buddies
are rat-fucking Kentucky.

59:56.059 --> 59:57.630
So we're talking about
the Sunday edition

59:57.659 --> 59:59.165
above the fold, right?

59:59.196 --> 01:00:00.385
- Right.

01:00:00.412 --> 01:00:02.693
- So I hear that you two
are Kentucky's answer

01:00:02.716 --> 01:00:04.800
to Woodward and Bernstein.

01:00:04.828 --> 01:00:05.820
- Who?

01:00:08.444 --> 01:00:09.404
- Never mind.

01:00:09.436 --> 01:00:11.749
But I am Deep Throat.

01:00:20.701 --> 01:00:27.586
<i>II'</i>

01:00:27.614 --> 01:00:29.665

with that major anchor

01:00:29.693 --> 01:00:30.850
in Lexington, Dani whatever?

01:00:30.878 --> 01:00:31.838
- I competed against her.

01:00:31.869 --> 01:00:32.896
- Well, that's close enough.

01:00:32.925 --> 01:00:34.496
But if you slipped her
the information-

01:00:34.526 --> 01:00:35.552
- We're not exactly friends.

01:00:35.582 --> 01:00:36.935
- But you can call her, right?
- Paul.

01:00:36.958 --> 01:00:38.279
- I don't understand
what's wrong.

01:00:38.302 --> 01:00:39.939
- Paul, shut up and fuck.

<i>- Yes, I Would.</i>

01:00:55.615 --> 01:00:56.739
<i>Uh, more than anything,</i>

01:00:56.768 --> 01:00:58.601
these charges are complete
and utter fiction.

01:00:58.624 --> 01:01:00.064
<i>John Grisham
could have Written this</i>

01:01:00.096 --> 01:01:01.766
<i>or, better still,
Stephen King,</i>

01:01:01.792 --> 01:01:03.013
<i>'cause this has-</i>

01:01:03.039 --> 01:01:05.124
<i>This has truly been
a horror story for my family.</i>

01:01:05.152 --> 01:01:07.302
<i>And this alleged diary
the man claims to have</i>

01:01:07.328 --> 01:01:11.082
<i>is just more fiction,
pure and simple.</i>

01:01:11.169 --> 01:01:13.035
<i>- And what about
Helena St. John,</i>

01:01:13.056 --> 01:01:15.751
<i>the woman at the center
of all of these charges?</i>

01:01:15.776 --> 01:01:17.544
<i>- well, Dani,
Ms. St. John returned</i>

01:01:17.569 --> 01:01:19.369
<i>to her parents' home
near Boston,</i>

01:01:19.393 --> 01:01:21.892
<i>Where she was briefly seen
yesterday.</i>

01:01:21.921 --> 01:01:23.394
<i>- Helena, over here.
We have a question!</i>

01:01:23.425 --> 01:01:25.225
<i>- Helena, Helena!</i>

01:01:25.249 --> 01:01:26.504
<i>Why are you denying the affair?</i>

01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:27.490
<i>- Why did you do it, Helena?</i>

01:01:27.521 --> 01:01:28.645
<i>Was all the sex consensual?</i>

01:01:28.673 --> 01:01:29.633
<i>- Helena!
Helena!</i>

01:01:29.666 --> 01:01:31.139
<i>Has the governor
been in touch with you?</i>

01:01:31.170 --> 01:01:32.196
<i>- Can We get an interview?</i>

01:01:32.226 --> 01:01:33.732
<i>- ls the governor gonna
divorce his Wife?</i>

01:01:33.761 --> 01:01:35.594
<i>- Helena, are you in rehab now?
- Helena!</i>

01:01:35.618 --> 01:01:38.565
<i>- And Ms. St. John
also came up back home,</i>

01:01:38.594 --> 01:01:39.882
<i>when We caught up
with the governor</i>

01:01:39.906 --> 01:01:40.866
<i>heading for a performance</i>

01:01:40.898 --> 01:01:42.153
<i>of the Good Shepherd
Youth Choir,</i>

01:01:42.178 --> 01:01:44.678
<i>run by Lexington
police officers.</i>

01:01:44.707 --> 01:01:47.206
<i>- The lady in question
is a good girl,</i>

01:01:47.235 --> 01:01:49.799
<i>Who, like so many fine people
from good families,</i>

01:01:49.827 --> 01:01:54.028
<i>fell into that terrible,
terrible abyss of drugs.</i>

01:01:54.051 --> 01:01:55.306
<i>Wish her all the luck
in the World</i>

01:01:55.332 --> 01:01:57.416
<i>in getting her life together,</i>

01:01:57.444 --> 01:01:59.757
<i>and I know that with
the assistance of clergy,</i>

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:00.806
<i>she'll be just fine</i>

01:02:00.836 --> 01:02:04.197
<i>and become clean and sober
once again.</i>

01:02:04.228 --> 01:02:05.799
- That's good.
Okay.

01:02:05.828 --> 01:02:07.301
Here's the spot Jimmy just out.

01:02:07.332 --> 01:02:08.870
We're running it
at 2,000 points,

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:10.537
heavy rotation
for the next two weeks,

01:02:10.564 --> 01:02:11.885
major cable buy.

01:02:11.909 --> 01:02:13.295
Lifetime, Ellen,

01:02:13.317 --> 01:02:16.809
just buying the shit
out of the mom demo.

01:02:16.837 --> 01:02:19.150
<i>- Some things
are pretty darn expensive,</i>

01:02:19.173 --> 01:02:21.999
<i>and it makes you Wonder
Where all that money comes from.</i>

01:02:22.021 --> 01:02:23.788
<i>The cost of incarcerating
a cocaine dealer</i>

01:02:23.813 --> 01:02:25.450
<i>in Kentucky for 15 months."</i>

01:02:25.477 --> 01:02:27.758
<i>$28,313.</i>

01:02:27.781 --> 01:02:29.647
<i>The cost of a brand-new pickup."</i>

01:02:29.669 --> 01:02:31.589
<i>$34,201,</i>

01:02:31.621 --> 01:02:33.575
<i>which was purchased
two days after claiming</i>

01:02:33.606 --> 01:02:35.177
<i>he had a diary for sale.</i>

01:02:35.205 --> 01:02:37.388
<i>The cost of cocaine rehab
for a month?</i>

01:02:37.414 --> 01:02:39.563
<i>$14,000.</i>

01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:42.188
<i>The cost of Wall Street banks
trying to ruin the reputation</i>

01:02:42.214 --> 01:02:44.495
<i>of a man who has served
the commonwealth of Kentucky</i>

01:02:44.518 --> 01:02:46.537
<i>his entire adult life."</i>

01:02:46.567 --> 01:02:48.073
<i>priceless.</i>

01:02:48.102 --> 01:02:49.641
- Booyah, motherfucker!

01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:51.373
- I owe you, man!

01:02:51.399 --> 01:02:53.003
But you better get your ass
out of Dodge.

01:02:53.031 --> 01:02:55.181
- Hey, next time you think
about running for office,

01:02:55.207 --> 01:02:56.234
try France.

01:02:56.263 --> 01:02:57.290
It's a better fit.

01:02:57.319 --> 01:03:00.178
Well, merci beaucoup.

01:03:00.199 --> 01:03:01.869
- Taxi will be here in five.

01:03:01.895 --> 01:03:03.762
So you also have the-
- Paul.

01:03:13.192 --> 01:03:14.513
You son of a bitch.

01:03:14.536 --> 01:03:17.264
I can't fucking believe it.

01:03:17.289 --> 01:03:18.729
Here.

01:03:25.161 --> 01:03:27.507
When you graduated law school,
you know where I was, right?

01:03:27.529 --> 01:03:29.515
- Sure.
You were two years behind me.

01:03:29.545 --> 01:03:32.557
- Right, in the same class
with your favorite pal.

01:03:32.586 --> 01:03:35.499
I got to tell you,
I have taken a lot.

01:03:35.530 --> 01:03:37.363
- I know you have.
- I'm not sure you do.

01:03:37.386 --> 01:03:40.496
My father was an artist
who struggled his whole life

01:03:40.522 --> 01:03:41.614
to support us,

01:03:41.642 --> 01:03:44.305
and he told me if I worked hard,
got good grades,

01:03:44.330 --> 01:03:48.116
and got into Harvard,
I could do whatever I wanted.

01:03:48.138 --> 01:03:50.037
Guess what I did
when I got there.

01:03:50.058 --> 01:03:52.372
Fell for one
Larry Lincoln Becker,

01:03:52.395 --> 01:03:54.828
dragged me back
to this godforsaken place.

01:03:54.859 --> 01:03:56.147
- Godforsaken?

01:03:56.171 --> 01:03:59.085
- If you grew up
in Brooklyn, absolutely.

01:03:59.115 --> 01:04:00.436
You know,
I've been a good sport.

01:04:00.459 --> 01:04:01.845
I've done my
stand-by-your man thing

01:04:01.867 --> 01:04:05.392
for a guy who will fuck anyone-
anything in a skirt.

01:04:05.419 --> 01:04:07.373
Honestly, it must be
so confusing for him

01:04:07.404 --> 01:04:09.685
when those Scottish bagpipers
come here to play.

01:04:09.708 --> 01:04:11.661
But it was all
between me and him,

01:04:11.692 --> 01:04:14.289
but now you go ahead
and you drag this girl

01:04:14.316 --> 01:04:15.408
through the mud,

01:04:15.436 --> 01:04:17.684
a girl with her whole life
ahead of her?

01:04:17.708 --> 01:04:18.898
Is that what it's come to?

01:04:18.925 --> 01:04:20.943
- Hey, she did the coke.
- Big deal.

01:04:20.972 --> 01:04:23.155
Half of America has done a line
once in their lives.

01:04:23.181 --> 01:04:24.719
- And she wasn't raped.

01:04:24.749 --> 01:04:26.354
She was a completely
willing participant.

01:04:26.381 --> 01:04:27.821
- Hardly.
- She knew what the score was.

01:04:27.853 --> 01:04:29.141
- What the fuck, Paul?

01:04:29.165 --> 01:04:30.933
Is it worth it?

01:04:30.957 --> 01:04:33.074
- Let me tell you
what I'm doing.

01:04:33.101 --> 01:04:35.185
I am playing to win

01:04:35.213 --> 01:04:38.356
so that your guy
gets another four years

01:04:38.382 --> 01:04:40.084
so that that asshole Perkins,

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:41.551
who is diametrically opposed

01:04:41.581 --> 01:04:43.731
to every single issue
that you care about:

01:04:43.758 --> 01:04:46.223
foreclosures, minimum wage,
clean air

01:04:46.254 --> 01:04:48.022
and who doesn't so much
as take a shit

01:04:48.046 --> 01:04:50.097
without first
having it stamped and approved

01:04:50.126 --> 01:04:51.315
by Wall Street banks

01:04:51.342 --> 01:04:53.241
and the mega-mining
and health care industries,

01:04:53.262 --> 01:04:55.346
doesn't get to sit
where Larry sits.

01:04:55.374 --> 01:04:58.801
- And doesn't it bother you,
the way you get there?

01:05:02.095 --> 01:05:04.408
It's just you and me here, Paul.

01:05:24.753 --> 01:05:26.226
- Thought you'd never
make it home.

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:28.024
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:05:28.049 --> 01:05:30.875
- Is that more Kentucky stuff?
- No.

01:05:30.897 --> 01:05:32.763
Penelope's petitions.

01:05:32.785 --> 01:05:34.291
And they're not just petitions.

01:05:34.322 --> 01:05:36.122
I mean, they are,
but there's also notes on them.

01:05:36.146 --> 01:05:37.335
- Oh, boy.

01:05:37.362 --> 01:05:39.828
"Best doctor I ever had."

01:05:39.857 --> 01:05:42.869
"Yes," followed by four
exclamation points.

01:05:42.898 --> 01:05:45.331
"I wish I could sign ten times,

01:05:45.362 --> 01:05:47.032
"because you are going to be
ten times better

01:05:47.058 --> 01:05:48.215
than what we got."

01:05:48.242 --> 01:05:49.912
- And ten times as likely
to get slaughtered.

01:05:49.939 --> 01:05:52.187
- Why not Penelope?

01:05:52.211 --> 01:05:53.367
- You know why.

01:05:53.394 --> 01:05:56.221
There's 101 reasons
why she can't win.

01:05:56.243 --> 01:05:57.945
- Yeah, I know.

01:05:57.971 --> 01:05:59.226
And they're all
really good ones,

01:05:59.251 --> 01:06:01.150
but I just feel like,
if she won,

01:06:01.171 --> 01:06:03.703
this world would be
a better place.

01:06:05.363 --> 01:06:08.157
- Not so?

01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:09.784
No?

01:06:17.428 --> 01:06:19.261
Hmm.

01:06:22.868 --> 01:06:24.222
- I didn't know
you were in town.

01:06:24.245 --> 01:06:25.980
- Can I talk to you
for a minute?

01:06:26.005 --> 01:06:26.965
- Yeah, sure.

01:06:31.573 --> 01:06:36.374
Look, I know that you're still
upset about Helena, but...

01:06:36.405 --> 01:06:37.627
this is what happens.

01:06:37.653 --> 01:06:41.691
- Paul, Helena tried
to commit suicide.

01:06:41.718 --> 01:06:43.584
She took a container
full of pills,

01:06:43.606 --> 01:06:45.473
but her mother found her.

01:06:45.494 --> 01:06:47.643
It happened over the weekend.

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:48.859
They're keeping it quiet.

01:06:48.886 --> 01:06:51.319
It's not in the media
and won't be.

01:06:51.350 --> 01:06:53.304
But her mother called
to tell me,

01:06:53.334 --> 01:06:56.662
and I thought
you should know too.

01:07:08.535 --> 01:07:11.481
- I had no idea it would...

01:07:13.975 --> 01:07:16.354
I didn't think
it would play like this.

01:07:20.344 --> 01:07:22.210
- This is what happens.

01:07:25.912 --> 01:07:26.971
- Professor St. John,

01:07:27.001 --> 01:07:28.768
it's just Paul Turner
calling again.

01:07:28.792 --> 01:07:31.968
Um, I know it's a hard time
for you and your family,

01:07:31.993 --> 01:07:34.077
but if you could give me a call

01:07:34.105 --> 01:07:35.359
at the number
that I left earlier,

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:38.048
that-that would be great.

01:07:38.074 --> 01:07:39.459
Thank you.

01:07:48.826 --> 01:07:51.172
Hello, Helena.
It's Paul Turner calling again.

01:07:51.194 --> 01:07:54.402
Um, look, if you'd like me
to stop calling you,

01:07:54.426 --> 01:07:58.267
just text me, and I will.

01:07:58.298 --> 01:07:59.968
Okay, thanks.

01:08:24.283 --> 01:08:27.776
Please, I just need five minutes
of your time.

01:08:27.804 --> 01:08:29.854
Pl-five minutes,
and I will go home.

01:08:29.884 --> 01:08:33.091
I promise.
Please.

01:08:33.116 --> 01:08:35.812
I can't begin to tell you
how sorry I am.

01:08:35.836 --> 01:08:38.750
We never should have done it.

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:40.930
I never should have done it.

01:08:40.957 --> 01:08:42.594
- But you did.

01:08:45.725 --> 01:08:48.006
Why?

01:08:48.029 --> 01:08:51.073
Why me?

01:08:51.102 --> 01:08:54.560
- I don't know.

01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:57.536
No, I do know.

01:08:59.645 --> 01:09:02.112
What we do

01:09:02.143 --> 01:09:04.675
is like a military guy
in Virginia

01:09:04.703 --> 01:09:06.754
piloting a drone
over Afghanistan

01:09:06.783 --> 01:09:07.939
and launching a missile.

01:09:07.966 --> 01:09:09.287
It seems like a video game

01:09:09.310 --> 01:09:11.974
and there aren't
real people involved.

01:09:11.999 --> 01:09:13.669
And you hit the fire button,

01:09:13.694 --> 01:09:15.081
and you're thinking,
"How'd we do?

01:09:15.103 --> 01:09:16.063
Did We hit it?"

01:09:16.095 --> 01:09:17.602
And sometimes we hit the target,

01:09:17.631 --> 01:09:21.439
and other times

01:09:21.471 --> 01:09:23.042
we destroy the building
with a red cross

01:09:23.072 --> 01:09:26.019
painted on the top.

01:09:26.048 --> 01:09:29.376
- It's not right.

01:09:29.408 --> 01:09:33.162
It's so not right.

01:09:33.184 --> 01:09:36.511
For years,
after a bad day at school,

01:09:36.545 --> 01:09:40.746
I'd jump on that trampoline.

01:09:40.769 --> 01:09:43.017
And I'd feel better,

01:09:43.041 --> 01:09:45.158
feel like I was free,

01:09:45.185 --> 01:09:47.301
floating in space.

01:09:47.330 --> 01:09:49.196
But at some point,
my mom would come out

01:09:49.216 --> 01:09:53.319
and tell me that I couldn't
stay here all night.

01:09:53.345 --> 01:09:57.546
The last thing that I wanted
was to come back to Earth.

01:09:57.570 --> 01:10:02.055
- And this is a big dose
of coming back down to Earth.

01:10:02.083 --> 01:10:04.396
- Giant dose.

01:10:07.939 --> 01:10:10.056
And my dad teaches
power and politics.

01:10:10.083 --> 01:10:12.942
I should've known.

01:10:12.963 --> 01:10:16.717
- No.
Nobody really understands power.

01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:20.778
I think that's why
we all abuse it so easily.

01:10:20.804 --> 01:10:24.743
- I'm sorry, but that's just
not good enough.

01:10:24.772 --> 01:10:27.337
Actions have consequences.

01:10:29.732 --> 01:10:32.078
And I think you do understand.

01:10:47.237 --> 01:10:48.296
. He)'-

01:10:48.325 --> 01:10:50.224
You know better than that.

01:10:50.245 --> 01:10:52.624
- Oh, yes, I do.

01:11:31.176 --> 01:11:32.747
- We have last month's
foreclosure stats,

01:11:32.776 --> 01:11:33.998
and we're cutting the spot now.

01:11:34.024 --> 01:11:36.240
- Good.
Where's the big guy?

01:11:36.265 --> 01:11:38.698
- You got me.

01:11:38.729 --> 01:11:41.162
- What's he doing,
hiking the Appalachian Trail?

01:11:41.193 --> 01:11:42.797
<i>- Yeah, something like that.</i>

01:11:42.825 --> 01:11:45.357
<i>- We're talking about the most
electronically connected dude</i>

01:11:45.385 --> 01:11:46.345
<i>on the planet.</i>

01:11:46.378 --> 01:11:49.040
<i>Where the hell is he?</i>

01:11:49.065 --> 01:11:52.044
- I have no idea.

01:11:52.074 --> 01:11:54.289
Hi, I'm so sorry
for calling you so many times,

01:11:54.313 --> 01:11:56.943
and I know you're really busy
and I called you yesterday.

01:11:56.970 --> 01:11:58.803
- It's fine, really.

01:11:58.826 --> 01:12:01.226
- Um, you haven't heard
from him yet, have you?

01:12:01.258 --> 01:12:03.441
- I haven't, but if I do,
I'll call you or text you.

01:12:03.466 --> 01:12:04.426
Are you okay?

01:12:04.459 --> 01:12:06.226
- Just a little worried.

01:12:06.250 --> 01:12:08.683
- Okay, well, I'll let you know
if I do.

01:12:08.714 --> 01:12:10.035
Okay, We-

01:12:14.571 --> 01:12:16.623
- I think you need a shot.

01:12:16.651 --> 01:12:18.517
- That's my line.

01:12:19.659 --> 01:12:21.678
- This is what
you're up against:

01:12:21.707 --> 01:12:23.475
internet tycoon

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:25.900
who, after two grueling
months teaching,

01:12:25.932 --> 01:12:27.918
is running as
a public school teacher,

01:12:27.948 --> 01:12:30.959
albeit a public school teacher
willing to spend $45 million,

01:12:30.988 --> 01:12:33.236
95% of which is his own money.

01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:34.450
- Serious stuff.

01:12:34.477 --> 01:12:37.172
- If you happen to get past him
in the primary,

01:12:37.197 --> 01:12:38.866
and that is a gigantic "if,"

01:12:38.892 --> 01:12:40.246
this is who you will face:

01:12:40.269 --> 01:12:42.964
Hammering Hank Harrison,
beloved television star

01:12:42.989 --> 01:12:44.113
and Tea Party hero,

01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:46.061
who is running as the outsider
in this race

01:12:46.093 --> 01:12:49.334
in spite of having $65 million
already in the bank

01:12:49.357 --> 01:12:51.573
and off-the-charts
name recognition.

01:12:51.597 --> 01:12:53.016
- And what do we have?

01:12:53.037 --> 01:12:53.997
- You.

01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:56.943
I'm flattered.

01:12:56.973 --> 01:12:58.708
But anything else?

01:12:58.734 --> 01:13:00.469
- Us.

01:13:00.494 --> 01:13:01.716
- Are you sure
you're up for this'?

01:13:01.742 --> 01:13:04.983
No more Appalachian Trail
walkabouts?

01:13:05.006 --> 01:13:08.116
- You know, I actually was on
the Appalachian Trail in Maine.

01:13:08.142 --> 01:13:10.357
- Well, welcome home.

01:13:10.382 --> 01:13:13.493
- So Jimmy is gonna
be following you around 24/7.

01:13:13.519 --> 01:13:14.545
He's gonna be filming you.

01:13:14.575 --> 01:13:15.961
We'll cut together some spots

01:13:15.983 --> 01:13:17.488
about who you are,
what you're about,

01:13:17.519 --> 01:13:18.807
your commitment to service,

01:13:18.831 --> 01:13:21.264
your dedication to this office,
that kind of thing.

01:13:21.295 --> 01:13:23.314
- And people are gonna want
to see this?

01:13:23.344 --> 01:13:25.777
- We can only hope.

01:13:25.808 --> 01:13:27.707
- Thank you.

01:13:27.728 --> 01:13:29.845
Thank you so much.

01:13:29.871 --> 01:13:32.730
In the words
of the great Hubert Humphrey,

01:13:32.752 --> 01:13:34.584
"I am proud to be here today

01:13:34.608 --> 01:13:37.882
to represent the people
who don't always have a voice,"

01:13:37.904 --> 01:13:40.730
our children,

01:13:40.752 --> 01:13:44.212
our poor,

01:13:44.241 --> 01:13:47.449
our elderly.

01:13:47.473 --> 01:13:49.754
I am proud to be here
on behalf of those

01:13:49.777 --> 01:13:52.210
who work
to make California work,

01:13:52.241 --> 01:13:54.074
the people who build our houses,

01:13:54.097 --> 01:13:56.378
teach our children,
care for our sick,

01:13:56.401 --> 01:13:58.802
put out the fires,
protect our streets,

01:13:58.833 --> 01:14:00.700
cook our food
pick our fruit,

01:14:00.722 --> 01:14:03.581
drive the trucks,
and clean our offices.

01:14:03.602 --> 01:14:06.461
I am here because we are all
in this together

01:14:06.482 --> 01:14:09.658
when it comes to standing tall
and standing strong

01:14:09.682 --> 01:14:11.831
to fight
for the California dream.

01:14:11.858 --> 01:14:13.080
- Field poll.

01:14:13.107 --> 01:14:14.777
- Where are we?

01:14:14.802 --> 01:14:16.221
- Still in the single digits.

01:14:16.243 --> 01:14:17.367
6%

01:14:17.395 --> 01:14:18.519
<i>- Oy.</i>

01:14:18.547 --> 01:14:20.730
- Oh, there's still time.

01:14:20.755 --> 01:14:23.450
- While they will protect
Wall Street banks

01:14:23.476 --> 01:14:24.436
and lower taxes

01:14:24.467 --> 01:14:26.781
for corporations
and millionaires,

01:14:26.804 --> 01:14:29.182
we will fight for jobs.

01:14:29.203 --> 01:14:30.906
- Can you do that again,
but really emphasize,

01:14:30.932 --> 01:14:32.372
"we will <i>fight</i> for jobs"?

01:14:32.404 --> 01:14:34.782
- While they will protect
Wall Street banks

01:14:34.804 --> 01:14:35.830
and lower taxes

01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:37.562
for corporations
and millionaires,

01:14:37.588 --> 01:14:39.639
we will fight for jobs.

01:14:39.668 --> 01:14:42.582
And while they will complain
about what is wrong in America,

01:14:42.613 --> 01:14:45.526
we will focus
on what is right in America.

01:14:45.557 --> 01:14:47.194
Today, our party,

01:14:47.221 --> 01:14:51.194
which has saved this nation
from depression, from fascism,

01:14:51.221 --> 01:14:53.272
from racism,
from corruption,

01:14:53.301 --> 01:14:54.654
is called upon to do it again,

01:14:54.677 --> 01:14:57.755
this time to save the state
from confusion and division,

01:14:57.782 --> 01:15:01.110
from the threat
of eventual fiscal disaster

01:15:01.141 --> 01:15:04.568
and from those
who lack the courage and vision

01:15:04.598 --> 01:15:08.701
to understand that we are all
in this together.

01:15:08.726 --> 01:15:10.363
- A little higher.

01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:12.190
Yeah, up.

01:15:12.214 --> 01:15:13.174
Yup.

01:15:13.206 --> 01:15:14.199
- Now how is it?

01:15:14.230 --> 01:15:16.380
- Perfect.

01:15:16.407 --> 01:15:19.036
- What do you think?

01:15:19.062 --> 01:15:21.627
- I think it's gonna be
a knife fight in a phone booth.

01:15:27.607 --> 01:15:30.073
- Protein shakes.

01:15:30.104 --> 01:15:31.424
- Are you sure you're gay?

01:15:31.447 --> 01:15:32.702
- Nope.

01:15:32.728 --> 01:15:34.648
- Then what the hell am I doing
with Peaches?

01:15:34.679 --> 01:15:35.803
- Peaches?

01:15:35.832 --> 01:15:37.087
Peaches?

01:15:37.112 --> 01:15:40.320
Is this a thing or a fling?

01:15:40.344 --> 01:15:41.435
- We need her.

01:15:41.464 --> 01:15:42.424
- We need her?

01:15:42.456 --> 01:15:44.158
What if I told you
I was screwing

01:15:44.184 --> 01:15:46.497
some hair product reporter
because we needed him?

01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:48.321
What would you say?

01:15:48.345 --> 01:15:49.698
- Is he local or national?

01:15:49.721 --> 01:15:51.162
- You would not.

01:15:57.465 --> 01:15:58.425
What?

01:15:58.457 --> 01:15:59.516
- You got to get here now!

01:15:59.545 --> 01:16:00.571
- No, we'll be there-

01:16:00.601 --> 01:16:01.856
We'll be there
in less than five.

01:16:01.881 --> 01:16:03.780
We're in the Mission now
We're on our way.

01:16:06.009 --> 01:16:07.231
- You're gonna give them
to me now, huh?

01:16:07.258 --> 01:16:08.513
You're gonna give me
my meds, huh?

01:16:08.538 --> 01:16:09.956
'Cause I will out
your fucking throat

01:16:09.978 --> 01:16:10.938
little girl.

01:16:10.970 --> 01:16:11.930
- Excuse me!
Excuse me!

01:16:11.963 --> 01:16:13.567
Hey, hey!

01:16:13.594 --> 01:16:15.296
- You gonna give 'em to me now,
little girl, huh?

01:16:15.322 --> 01:16:16.282
- Put it down! Stop!
Ah!

01:16:16.314 --> 01:16:17.274
- You too, Penelope?

01:16:17.307 --> 01:16:18.431
You gonna fucking dis me too?

01:16:18.459 --> 01:16:19.419
Huh?

01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:20.640
Fucking dis me too!

01:16:20.666 --> 01:16:23.045
<i>-</i> Hey, Tommy.

01:16:23.067 --> 01:16:26.657
Tommy, Marisol is one
of the sweetest,

01:16:26.683 --> 01:16:27.774
nicest people I have ever met.

01:16:27.803 --> 01:16:29.887
She would never
intentionally disrespect you.

01:16:29.915 --> 01:16:31.007
And you know that, right?

01:16:31.035 --> 01:16:32.421
- It's not true.
- No, never.

01:16:32.443 --> 01:16:34.310
We don't even have
the pills you want, Tommy.

01:16:34.332 --> 01:16:36.994
- Okay, Tommy.

01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:38.657
Give me the knife, okay?
Please.

01:16:38.684 --> 01:16:39.906
- No, I need my meds.

01:16:39.932 --> 01:16:40.991
- I know.

01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:42.274
Give me the knife.

01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:43.838
Give me the knife, Tommy.
Please.

01:16:43.868 --> 01:16:44.861
Give me the knife.

01:16:44.892 --> 01:16:47.108
- No!

01:16:47.132 --> 01:16:48.485
- Give me the knife.

01:16:48.508 --> 01:16:50.308
- I can't.

01:16:50.332 --> 01:16:51.391
- Please.

01:16:51.421 --> 01:16:53.156
Give me the knife.

01:16:56.861 --> 01:16:58.498
- I need my meds, Penelope!

01:16:58.525 --> 01:17:00.063
My meds, Penelope.

01:17:01.085 --> 01:17:02.045
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:17:02.078 --> 01:17:03.780
- We should get you inside.

01:17:03.806 --> 01:17:06.087
- Holy shit.

01:17:14.174 --> 01:17:15.166
- I'm glad you're okay.

01:17:15.198 --> 01:17:16.158
- I'm fine.
- I'm glad.

01:17:16.190 --> 01:17:19.846
- I'll be fine.
- Thank you.

01:17:19.871 --> 01:17:23.046
I'm, um, so sorry.

01:17:23.070 --> 01:17:24.292
Really, really, sorry, you know?

01:17:24.319 --> 01:17:25.508
- Don't be sorry.

01:17:25.534 --> 01:17:27.040
No, we're just glad
that ever},/one's okay

01:17:27.071 --> 01:17:28.130
and that Jimmy called us.

01:17:28.159 --> 01:17:30.244
- Yeah, I mean,
you were amazing out there.

01:17:30.271 --> 01:17:31.363
- Yeah.
- Incredible.

01:17:31.392 --> 01:17:32.352
- No, no.

01:17:32.383 --> 01:17:33.704
You see,
one of the biggest clichés

01:17:33.727 --> 01:17:34.884
about this neighborhood.

01:17:34.912 --> 01:17:37.061
Normally it's not
like this, really.

01:17:40.416 --> 01:17:42.794
You're probably right.

01:17:42.815 --> 01:17:45.161
If I can't even control
my own little space,

01:17:45.184 --> 01:17:47.563
how can I control
an entire state?

01:17:49.473 --> 01:17:50.695
Right?

01:18:01.889 --> 01:18:03.308
- So this is what
you've wrought:

01:18:03.330 --> 01:18:05.730
Facebook likes,
1.2 million and counting.

01:18:05.761 --> 01:18:07.681
Number of YouTube views
of you taking the knife away

01:18:07.714 --> 01:18:08.805
from the crazy person:

01:18:08.834 --> 01:18:12.195
4,318,000.

01:18:12.225 --> 01:18:13.185
- And counting.

01:18:13.218 --> 01:18:14.473
And watch this.

01:18:14.498 --> 01:18:17.030
<i>- She's awesome.
She's really inspiring.</i>

01:18:17.058 --> 01:18:19.786
<i>- That lady is definitely
Walking the walk.</i>

01:18:19.810 --> 01:18:21.578
- Okay, you cannot
take that bandage off

01:18:21.603 --> 01:18:22.988
until the election.

01:18:23.011 --> 01:18:24.997
- It's been almost two weeks.
I think it's time.

01:18:25.027 --> 01:18:26.183
- No, no, no.

01:18:26.211 --> 01:18:27.881
You've got to give me
at least another month.

01:18:27.907 --> 01:18:29.413
- I'll give you a week.
- Sold.

01:18:29.443 --> 01:18:32.422
- What the fuck?
- What?

01:18:32.451 --> 01:18:34.317
- Check it out.

01:18:34.339 --> 01:18:35.332
- <i>Helping the homeless</i>

01:18:35.364 --> 01:18:37.099
<i>is nothing new
for San Francisco.</i>

01:18:37.124 --> 01:18:38.990
<i>We have along history of it
in our city.</i>

01:18:39.011 --> 01:18:40.616
<i>But what is new is a program</i>

01:18:40.644 --> 01:18:42.827
<i>one of the volunteers here
has started.</i>

01:18:42.851 --> 01:18:43.812
- <i>Exhale.</i>

01:18:48.453 --> 01:18:49.479
<i>Breathe in.</i>

01:18:49.509 --> 01:18:51.528
<i>- Tawny Shearson
is no ordinary volunteer.</i>

01:18:51.556 --> 01:18:53.608
<i>She has started
a special program</i>

01:18:53.637 --> 01:18:55.688
<i>for San Francisco's
homeless children.</i>

01:18:55.717 --> 01:18:57.223
<i>- well, the idea is,</i>

01:18:57.252 --> 01:18:58.376
<i>Why should only rich children</i>

01:18:58.405 --> 01:19:00.238
<i>get all the amazing benefits
of yoga?</i>

01:19:00.261 --> 01:19:01.385
<i>These kids love it!</i>

01:19:01.413 --> 01:19:02.635
<i>They can't get enough of it.</i>

01:19:02.661 --> 01:19:06.567
<i>And honestly, I can't get enough
teaching them.</i>

01:19:06.597 --> 01:19:09.162
<i>- Tawny Shearson, a woman
truly making a difference</i>

01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:10.827
<i>for those who need it most.</i>

01:19:10.853 --> 01:19:13.036
<i>Rick Sanchez, KXSF News,</i>

01:19:13.061 --> 01:19:15.561
<i>at Saint Mary's Church
in the Tenderloin.</i>

01:19:15.589 --> 01:19:17.357
- Okay, so when she's not
blackmailing us,

01:19:17.382 --> 01:19:18.342
she's running for saint?

01:19:18.374 --> 01:19:19.760
- Those guys are good.

01:19:19.782 --> 01:19:21.222
- Mandy Denton behind this?

01:19:21.254 --> 01:19:22.476
- 100%.

01:19:22.503 --> 01:19:25.165
And we violated the number one
commandment in politics.

01:19:25.190 --> 01:19:28.431
We had her down,
and we did not put in the shiv.

01:19:29.159 --> 01:19:30.185
All right,
when you think of family,

01:19:30.215 --> 01:19:31.655
what are the first things
you think of?

01:19:31.687 --> 01:19:32.942
- Love, protection, warmth.

01:19:32.967 --> 01:19:34.288
- Security, fun.

01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:35.850
- Caring, a bond, support.

01:19:35.879 --> 01:19:37.680
- Strength as a unit, shelter.

01:19:37.703 --> 01:19:38.925
- That's good.
When we get back-

01:19:38.951 --> 01:19:40.970
- <i>Penelope Nelson
runs this clinic,</i>

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.702
<i>the same Penelope Nelson</i>

01:19:42.727 --> 01:19:45.608
<i>who claims she's qualified
to be your governor.</i>

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:47.211
<i>What she doesn't tell you is,</i>

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:51.048
<i>28% of those who come here are
not Americans</i>

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:52.848
<i>but illegal aliens.</i>

01:19:52.873 --> 01:19:55.121
<i>And it's all funded by you.</i>

01:19:55.145 --> 01:19:57.360
<i>You pay far too much
in taxes already</i>

01:19:57.384 --> 01:19:58.344
so <i>that</i> Penelope

01:19:58.377 --> 01:20:00.942
<i>can spend your money
on illegals?</i>

01:20:00.968 --> 01:20:03.347
<i>You work hard.
You play by the rules.</i>

01:20:03.369 --> 01:20:04.395
<i>Why doesn't she?</i>

01:20:04.425 --> 01:20:05.963
<i>Hank Harrison.</i>

01:20:05.993 --> 01:20:08.110
<i>Let's make California
great again.</i>

01:20:08.138 --> 01:20:10.058
<i>- I'm Hank Harrison,
and with your help,</i>

01:20:10.090 --> 01:20:11.311
<i>We can take back
our government.</i>

01:20:12.330 --> 01:20:13.389
- That's good.

01:20:13.418 --> 01:20:14.858
- Now it's really incoming.

01:20:14.890 --> 01:20:17.901
Tawny's lawyer.

01:20:17.930 --> 01:20:20.178
- Erik the Red
has scheduled a press conference

01:20:20.202 --> 01:20:21.905
with Tawny tomorrow at 6:00.

01:20:21.931 --> 01:20:24.080
He'll call it off
if we deliver him $2 million

01:20:24.106 --> 01:20:25.197
tomorrow at 4:00.

01:20:25.226 --> 01:20:26.994
- Down $1 million.
- It's still blackmail.

01:20:27.019 --> 01:20:28.688
- And the answer is still-
- No fucking way!

01:20:28.714 --> 01:20:30.319
- Good, good.
Okay.

01:20:30.347 --> 01:20:33.042
Good. Okay.
All right.

01:20:33.067 --> 01:20:35.664
First, Tawny has a story,

01:20:35.691 --> 01:20:39.052
but so does Peaches
and her new BFF, Angela.

01:20:39.083 --> 01:20:40.371
How is that going?

01:20:40.395 --> 01:20:41.421
- All set.
- Good.

01:20:41.451 --> 01:20:43.983
And second,
starting on the 5:00 news,

01:20:44.012 --> 01:20:46.413
we're launching a saturation buy
of the downed helicopter spot

01:20:46.443 --> 01:20:47.698
with your war buddy.

01:20:47.724 --> 01:20:51.151
Three, we are making your name
and the word "family"

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:52.207
synonymous.

01:20:52.236 --> 01:20:53.196
Think Stephen Green,

01:20:53.228 --> 01:20:54.287
think family.

01:20:54.317 --> 01:20:55.757
- Take all the things
that family means,

01:20:55.788 --> 01:20:56.748
and go from there,

01:20:56.781 --> 01:20:58.647
like love, warmth, strength,

01:20:58.668 --> 01:21:00.370
protection, support, caring.

01:21:00.396 --> 01:21:01.423
- And with each one of those,

01:21:01.452 --> 01:21:03.351
we do a photo and message
of the day.

01:21:03.372 --> 01:21:04.878
- Like what?

01:21:04.909 --> 01:21:06.514
- Well, let's start
with the last one

01:21:06.541 --> 01:21:07.829
caring.

01:21:07.853 --> 01:21:09.905
As in caring
for your children's future.

01:21:09.934 --> 01:21:10.993
We've worked something up

01:21:11.021 --> 01:21:12.592
around your affordable
college program,

01:21:12.621 --> 01:21:13.909
which I love, incidentally.

01:21:13.933 --> 01:21:15.472
- We'll send you to a school
or something.

01:21:15.501 --> 01:21:17.717
editorials.

01:21:17.742 --> 01:21:19.858
Tawny's gonna cry to
every reporter with a laptop

01:21:19.886 --> 01:21:20.945
that you're a bad guy.

01:21:20.974 --> 01:21:22.840
We get editorials saying
that the last thing

01:21:22.862 --> 01:21:24.281
anybody needs in this economy

01:21:24.302 --> 01:21:26.102
is more lipstick
and pig stories.

01:21:26.126 --> 01:21:28.243
Everybody should be focusing
on real issues

01:21:28.271 --> 01:21:29.297
that affect real Americans.

01:21:29.327 --> 01:21:30.713
- Okay, okay, how about this:

01:21:30.735 --> 01:21:33.234
We suggest, gently, but serve it
on a silver platter,

01:21:33.263 --> 01:21:35.096
that Tawny
is a complete distraction

01:21:35.119 --> 01:21:36.308
from real issues.

01:21:36.335 --> 01:21:37.808
And let them hark back
to when Mark Twain

01:21:37.839 --> 01:21:39.192
was a reporter here

01:21:39.215 --> 01:21:41.463
and that he could see through
all the smoke and nonsense,

01:21:41.487 --> 01:21:42.742
like this smoke and nonsense.

01:21:42.768 --> 01:21:44.568
- Mark Twain.
They love Mark Twain.

01:21:44.592 --> 01:21:46.807
I love quoting Mark Twain.

01:21:46.831 --> 01:21:49.331
- Well, she actually uses
zero fossil fuels

01:21:49.359 --> 01:21:50.833
and thus has zero emissions.

01:21:50.864 --> 01:21:52.981
She can go at highway speeds,

01:21:53.008 --> 01:21:54.874
and what's more,
she was built entirely

01:21:54.896 --> 01:21:56.282
by the class you see here.

01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:00.437
<i>- Thank you all for coming.</i>

01:22:00.465 --> 01:22:02.298
<i>This is Tawny Shearson.
- Hello.</i>

01:22:02.321 --> 01:22:04.820
<i>- She's gonna tell you
quite a story</i>

01:22:04.849 --> 01:22:08.723
<i>about a woman wronged
by a United States senator.</i>

01:22:08.753 --> 01:22:10.357
- Senator, last month we went

01:22:10.385 --> 01:22:11.706
to the California
Solar Challenge.

01:22:11.730 --> 01:22:12.690
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

01:22:12.721 --> 01:22:13.714
- And of the five finalists,

01:22:13.746 --> 01:22:15.132
we were the only
public school there,

01:22:15.154 --> 01:22:16.442
but we won.

01:22:16.466 --> 01:22:18.266
And what we're showing here
is that what it takes

01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:20.374
to achieve in science
isn't all about money.

01:22:20.402 --> 01:22:23.228
It's about inventiveness
and creativity and brain power,

01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:25.149
all of which this class has
in abundance.

01:22:25.170 --> 01:22:27.484
- Well, this is amazing.
This is truly amazing.

01:22:27.506 --> 01:22:28.794
And I think I speak for myself,

01:22:28.818 --> 01:22:30.324
but I also think I speak
for every senator

01:22:30.354 --> 01:22:32.788
when I say that we can learn
a lot from Mr. Quinn's class.

01:22:32.818 --> 01:22:34.040
It's truly amazing!

01:22:34.067 --> 01:22:36.053
Give yourselves
a round of applause.

01:22:36.083 --> 01:22:37.175
- Thank you so much for coming.

01:22:37.202 --> 01:22:39.603
- Senator!

01:22:39.635 --> 01:22:41.272
- Senator!
Senator Green, one question.

01:22:41.299 --> 01:22:42.521
- Senator Green.
Senator Green.

01:22:42.547 --> 01:22:43.933
Are you aware
of the press conference

01:22:43.955 --> 01:22:45.244
Tawny Shearson just gave?

01:22:45.268 --> 01:22:47.483
She's claiming
you had an affair.

01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:52.126
- I was just thinking
about something

01:22:52.148 --> 01:22:53.174
that Mark Twain once said,

01:22:53.204 --> 01:22:56.118
which is, "When in doubt,
tell the truth."

01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:58.331
Well, here's the truth.

01:22:58.356 --> 01:23:00.223
I have a bad back.

01:23:00.244 --> 01:23:04.729
I injured it in the service
in Afghanistan.

01:23:04.756 --> 01:23:06.743
And I receive physical therapy
for that injury,

01:23:06.772 --> 01:23:09.850
including massages.

01:23:09.877 --> 01:23:12.442
And during one
of those massages,

01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:14.237
I crossed the line.

01:23:14.261 --> 01:23:15.767
And, uh, here's some more truth.

01:23:15.798 --> 01:23:18.941
There is-there's no one
to blame for this but me.

01:23:18.966 --> 01:23:20.187
There is no excuse
for what I did.

01:23:20.213 --> 01:23:22.133
It was wrong.
It was-

01:23:22.166 --> 01:23:23.454
It was wrong to do to my family.

01:23:23.478 --> 01:23:25.497
It was wrong to do
to the people

01:23:25.526 --> 01:23:26.683
that I set an example for.

01:23:26.710 --> 01:23:29.275
It was just plain wrong, period.

01:23:29.302 --> 01:23:31.834
Now, I could stand up here,
and I could spin the facts,

01:23:31.863 --> 01:23:33.729
and I could maybe fool
some of you,

01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:36.445
but I believe that the people
of California deserve better.

01:23:36.471 --> 01:23:40.706
I think that we are all tired
of the spin.

01:23:40.727 --> 01:23:44.732
So, I am just here to offer
my sincere apology.

01:23:44.759 --> 01:23:47.672
And it is my hope
that the citizens of California

01:23:47.703 --> 01:23:50.169
will forgive me
for this mistake

01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:51.586
and will choose to reelect me.

01:23:51.608 --> 01:23:55.132
I promise I will be
your senator,

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:58.172
and I will work tirelessly
for the things

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.578
that matter most to you,

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.678
like classes taught
by Matt Quinn here,

01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:06.880
where our children
are truly inventing the future.

01:24:06.904 --> 01:24:10.593
And to that end,
I am proposing

01:24:10.617 --> 01:24:14.338
a oil company
windfall profit tax

01:24:14.361 --> 01:24:16.380
with the revenue
providing the funds

01:24:16.409 --> 01:24:19.323
for every student in America
with a B-plus average and above

01:24:19.354 --> 01:24:20.510
to go to college.

01:24:26.938 --> 01:24:29.601
I'm prepared
to do everything for you,

01:24:29.626 --> 01:24:34.046
as a not-perfect
but a truly dedicated man

01:24:34.075 --> 01:24:37.697
who will always fight for you.

01:24:43.771 --> 01:24:50.788
<i>II'</i>

01:24:50.811 --> 01:24:54.238
<i>- Mission in Afghanistan
my helicopter was shot down.</i>

01:24:54.268 --> 01:24:57.346
<i>Both of my legs
and four ribs were broken.</i>

01:24:57.371 --> 01:24:59.620
<i>The enemy came to finish us off,</i>

01:24:59.644 --> 01:25:01.346
<i>but the young officer
that I was transporting</i>

01:25:01.372 --> 01:25:03.904
<i>single-handedly fought off
an entire squad of Taliban</i>

01:25:03.933 --> 01:25:05.319
<i>until reinforcements
could arrive.</i>

01:25:05.341 --> 01:25:06.595
- Nice.

01:25:11.837 --> 01:25:13.855
<i>-</i> Up, up, up!

01:25:13.885 --> 01:25:16.133
Senator, you have jumped
five points!

01:25:16.157 --> 01:25:17.598
It is off the charts!

01:25:17.630 --> 01:25:18.721
- Whoo!

01:25:18.749 --> 01:25:19.709
- On the other hand,

01:25:19.742 --> 01:25:21.062
Tawny is going to kick ass

01:25:21.085 --> 01:25:23.301
if she ever decides to open
a chain of massage parlors.

01:25:23.326 --> 01:25:25.093
- Oh, sweet.
Tell him to check his email.

01:25:25.117 --> 01:25:26.438
Jimmy just
sent us all a present.

01:25:26.462 --> 01:25:27.422
- Check your email.

01:25:27.454 --> 01:25:28.742
We got something
coming your way.

01:25:28.766 --> 01:25:30.468
<i>- And then Tawny went up
to the rollerblade guy</i>

01:25:30.494 --> 01:25:32.807
<i>and took two knee pads,
and she said,</i>

01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:35.493
<i>"These guys,
a ticket to Washington,</i>

01:25:35.519 --> 01:25:39.360
<i>and this body
and I'm golden, “</i>

01:25:39.391 --> 01:25:41.791
<i>- How did that make you feel?</i>

01:25:41.823 --> 01:25:43.111
- Um...

01:25:43.135 --> 01:25:45.830
- Now, that is room service.

01:25:45.855 --> 01:25:47.525
- Oh, my God.

01:25:47.551 --> 01:25:50.278
Penelope's video just got
5 million views on YouTube.

01:25:50.303 --> 01:25:52.170
- You see, when you're doing
God's work

01:25:52.192 --> 01:25:53.927
and you're at the right place
at the right time,

01:25:53.952 --> 01:25:54.912
good things happen.

01:25:54.943 --> 01:25:56.417
- Best 100 bucks you ever spent.

01:25:56.447 --> 01:25:57.953
- What do you mean?

01:25:57.984 --> 01:26:00.035
- What do you mean
what do I mean?

01:26:00.064 --> 01:26:01.767
- What are you talking about?

01:26:01.792 --> 01:26:04.651
Does somebody want to tell me
what's going on?

01:26:04.673 --> 01:26:07.073
- It's okay
- Oh, my God.

01:26:08.097 --> 01:26:10.629
I just assumed
that she told you.

01:26:10.656 --> 01:26:14.825
Your girl here had me
send the guy to the clinic.

01:26:14.849 --> 01:26:16.038
- You did what?

01:26:16.065 --> 01:26:18.378
- Okay, in her defense,

01:26:18.401 --> 01:26:19.623
I gave the guy 100 bucks.

01:26:19.649 --> 01:26:21.569
I told him to scream,
wave the knife around a little.

01:26:21.602 --> 01:26:22.856
In no way...

01:26:22.881 --> 01:26:25.064
I did not think that he was
gonna take a hostage.

01:26:25.089 --> 01:26:26.562
I didn't think
that was gonna happen.

01:26:26.594 --> 01:26:28.231
- You gave a junkie a knife?

01:26:28.258 --> 01:26:29.512
- Yeah, well, in retrospect...

01:26:29.537 --> 01:26:30.727
- Meg Whitman spent

01:26:30.753 --> 01:26:33.351
$175 million-plus
running for governor.

01:26:33.378 --> 01:26:35.593
We spent $100

01:26:35.618 --> 01:26:37.288
and took Penelope's
name recognition

01:26:37.315 --> 01:26:40.326
from nonexistent to omnipresent.

01:26:40.354 --> 01:26:41.478
Am I fired?

01:26:49.155 --> 01:26:51.817
- You are a brilliant,

01:26:51.843 --> 01:26:52.935
beautiful woman.

01:26:54.084 --> 01:26:55.470
- Mm!

01:26:55.492 --> 01:26:58.121
What happened to the guy?

01:26:58.147 --> 01:27:00.613
- He's doing 90 days.

01:27:00.644 --> 01:27:02.412
I'll give him another $500
when he gets out.

01:27:02.435 --> 01:27:05.349
He'll send me flowers
for such a nice payday.

01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:07.781
Okay, I'll give him $1,000.

01:27:16.197 --> 01:27:18.346
<i>- As We've been reporting,
Stephen Green</i>

01:27:18.373 --> 01:27:20.751
<i>had an easy reelection tonight,</i>

01:27:20.773 --> 01:27:23.850
<i>but the real story
is right here,</i>

01:27:23.877 --> 01:27:26.125
<i>in a gubernatorial race
that's too tight to call</i>

01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:28.844
between <i>upstart candidate
Penelope Nelson</i>

01:27:28.869 --> 01:27:31.270
<i>and Hollywood megastar
Hank Harrison.</i>

01:27:31.302 --> 01:27:33.834
- We have really done
something incredible.

01:27:33.861 --> 01:27:35.400
No matter what happens tonight,

01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:37.383
we have done
something incredible.

01:27:41.031 --> 01:27:44.337
<i>- It was a very steep hill
to climb indeed.</i>

01:27:44.359 --> 01:27:46.759
<i>Ms. Nelson is</i> going <i>to</i> need
a huge <i>turnout</i>

01:27:46.791 --> 01:27:48.396
<i>in Los Angeles
and the Bay Area</i>

01:27:48.423 --> 01:27:51.816
<i>if she has any hope of eating
into Mr. Harrison's margins.</i>

01:27:51.847 --> 01:27:54.380
<i>Again, very discouraging news</i>

01:27:54.407 --> 01:27:57.005
<i>for Ms. Nelson's campaign
and her supporters.</i>

01:27:57.031 --> 01:27:58.602
<i>Hank Harrison,
one of the country's</i>

01:28:00.488 --> 01:28:03.566
<i>has been in the public eye
for over three decades.</i>

01:28:03.592 --> 01:28:06.287
<i>And with 76%

01:28:06.312 --> 01:28:10.066
<i>if he can maintain that lead,
he'll be our next governor.</i>

01:28:10.089 --> 01:28:12.009
We have <i>just</i> learned
<i>that</i> Santa Barbara,

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:14.059
<i>San Joaquin,
and Sacramento Counties,</i>

01:28:14.088 --> 01:28:16.915
<i>all bellwether counties,
have reported,</i>

01:28:16.937 --> 01:28:19.818
<i>and all three
have gone narrowly</i>

01:28:19.848 --> 01:28:22.381
<i>for Hank Harrison.</i>

01:28:22.409 --> 01:28:27.025
<i>This is a devastating blow
to Ms. Nelson's campaign.</i>

01:28:27.049 --> 01:28:29.330
<i>Sacramento must also
be particularly disappointing</i>

01:28:29.353 --> 01:28:30.542
<i>for her, as, traditionally...</i>

01:28:30.569 --> 01:28:32.239
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:28:32.266 --> 01:28:35.442
<i>- As goes Sacramento County,
so goes California.</i>

01:28:35.466 --> 01:28:36.971
<i>And We're still waiting
for results</i>

01:28:37.002 --> 01:28:40.494

01:28:40.522 --> 01:28:42.127
<i>Okay.</i>

01:28:42.154 --> 01:28:43.213
<i>We just got Word.</i>

01:28:43.242 --> 01:28:45.326
<i>Los Angeles County
has reported,</i>

01:28:45.355 --> 01:28:48.301
<i>and Penelope Nelson

01:28:48.331 --> 01:28:49.553
- Hey!
Hey!

01:28:49.579 --> 01:28:51.728
" My God!

01:29:01.516 --> 01:29:05.324
<i>- What an incredible victory
for Penelope Nelson.</i>

01:29:05.356 --> 01:29:07.539
<i>Penelope Nelson,
who ran her campaign</i>

01:29:07.564 --> 01:29:11.372
<i>on passion and promise
but so very little money,</i>

01:29:11.404 --> 01:29:12.910
<i>will be the next governor
of California.</i>

01:29:12.941 --> 01:29:13.933
- Un-fucking-believable.

01:29:13.964 --> 01:29:15.732
Un-fucking-believable!

01:29:22.925 --> 01:29:25.424
Thank you!
Thank you!

01:29:25.453 --> 01:29:27.123
<i>- Thank you, California!</i>

01:29:27.149 --> 01:29:28.109
<i>Thank you!</i>

01:29:34.670 --> 01:29:38.773
<i>- And at the governor's mansion
earlier, this was the scene.</i>

01:29:38.798 --> 01:29:41.428
- <i>What</i> a <i>feeling?</i>

01:29:44.175 --> 01:29:46.837

01:29:46.862 --> 01:29:47.855
Hey!

01:29:47.886 --> 01:29:50.516

01:29:50.542 --> 01:29:51.666
- Oh!

01:29:51.695 --> 01:29:54.456
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

01:29:57.103 --> 01:29:58.609
And you.

01:29:58.639 --> 01:30:00.079
Thanks.

01:30:02.735 --> 01:30:03.990
<i>-</i> Wow!

01:30:04.016 --> 01:30:05.238
- I think it's, "Wow, Governor."

01:30:05.263 --> 01:30:06.224
- Absolutely!

01:30:06.256 --> 01:30:07.729
Wow, Governor!

01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:10.041
- I got a lot of work to do.

01:30:10.064 --> 01:30:11.352
So do both of you.

01:30:11.376 --> 01:30:13.754
- Well, I'm losing her.

01:30:13.776 --> 01:30:15.347
I'm losing her
to medical school.

01:30:15.376 --> 01:30:18.203
This is her swan song.

01:30:18.225 --> 01:30:20.952
- Actually,
I'm gonna withdraw my apps.

01:30:23.792 --> 01:30:24.752
- Really?

01:30:24.785 --> 01:30:27.033
- Really.

01:30:29.937 --> 01:30:31.542
- Well, I got to get reelected
in four years,

01:30:31.570 --> 01:30:33.785
and I can't get stabbed twice,
you know.

01:30:33.809 --> 01:30:34.966
- Oh, we'll think of something.
