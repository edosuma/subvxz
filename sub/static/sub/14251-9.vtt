00:02.569 --> 00:04.332
Last time,
on Star Trek: Voyager...

00:12.645 --> 00:14.135
Looks like
this entire part of space

00:14.214 --> 00:15.146
has changed somehow.

00:15.215 --> 00:17.342
We should dismantle this weapon

00:17.417 --> 00:18.975
and rejoin our people.

00:19.052 --> 00:21.384
No, not until every colony...

00:21.454 --> 00:22.478
every individual...

00:22.589 --> 00:24.250
every blade of grass
is restored.

00:24.324 --> 00:26.656
lt appears that someone...

00:26.726 --> 00:29.661
or something
has altered history.

00:39.305 --> 00:40.829
Captain, that energy beam--

00:40.907 --> 00:42.772
it's pushing Voyager
out of the space- time continuum.

00:42.842 --> 00:45.709
He's trying to erase us
from history.

00:48.782 --> 00:51.774
l promised myself that l
would never give this order,

00:51.851 --> 00:54.251
that l would never break up
this family,

00:54.320 --> 00:56.083
but asking you to stay...

00:58.425 --> 01:00.586
would be asking you to die.

01:04.763 --> 01:06.527
And now, the conclusion.

01:08.935 --> 01:13.065
Captain's Log, Stardate 51425. 4.

01:13.139 --> 01:16.472
Our condition has left us
vulnerable to spatial anomalies

01:16.543 --> 01:20.343
and to any alien species
eager for a piece of hardware.

01:20.413 --> 01:23.314
We've taken refuge
in a class- 9 nebula.

01:32.025 --> 01:33.390
Oh, come on!

01:33.460 --> 01:36.725
Don't do this to me now.

01:36.796 --> 01:38.491
Emergency force fields
are holding.

01:38.565 --> 01:40.658
How the hell did all this gas
get inside?

01:40.733 --> 01:43.031
Looks like a malfunction
in the ventilation system.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.177
Okay, l'm going to try

01:55.248 --> 01:58.149
reversing the osmotic pressure
on this deck.

01:58.218 --> 01:59.879
- Oh!
- Whoa!

02:00.954 --> 02:03.548
The gas corroded
the circuit relays.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.215
Let's bypass.

02:07.594 --> 02:10.620
We've got three minutes
of air left.

02:10.697 --> 02:12.460
How long can you
hold your breath?

02:17.804 --> 02:20.272
Ensign Kim found time
to be treated, so can you.

02:20.340 --> 02:21.364
How is Harry?

02:21.441 --> 02:23.432
He'll be fine, but l'm surprised
he didn't asphyxiate.

02:23.576 --> 02:25.339
l told you eight minutes
on that deck,

02:25.411 --> 02:27.971
not eight and a half,
not nine, and certainly not 12.

02:28.047 --> 02:29.947
Would you rather have
an indoor nebula?

02:30.016 --> 02:31.313
lf we didn't stop it
then and there,

02:31.384 --> 02:32.942
it would have flooded
another two decks.

02:33.019 --> 02:34.077
B'Elanna, engines?

02:34.154 --> 02:35.086
Not yet, Captain.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.713
One of the warp nacelles
is still off- line.

02:36.789 --> 02:37.813
The other one's a lost cause.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.882
Route all available power
to the good one.

02:41.060 --> 02:43.153
The alveoli in your lungs
have been chemically burned.

02:43.229 --> 02:45.322
l want you off your feet
for the next 48 hours.

02:45.398 --> 02:47.025
lmpossible. l've got
too much work to do.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.761
There are seven
other crew members on board.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.735
You're the Captain.
Delegate.

02:50.803 --> 02:51.929
lnject me with trioxin.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.495
That should help me
breathe a little easier.

02:53.606 --> 02:55.403
B'Elanna, stand by
for the transfer.

02:55.475 --> 02:56.442
Right.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.409
Trioxin is used
in emergency situations

02:58.478 --> 02:59.968
as a stopgap measure.

03:00.046 --> 03:01.809
Your lungs have suffered
serious damage.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.145
They need to be treated
properly.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.115
Doctor's orders.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.846
Captain's orders--
trioxin, now.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.410
Aye, aye.

03:08.521 --> 03:09.749
lt's your body.

03:09.822 --> 03:11.312
Who am l to judge?

03:11.391 --> 03:12.949
l'm only the Chief
Medical Officer.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.118
What do l know?

03:14.194 --> 03:15.286
Thank you.

03:20.066 --> 03:21.533
Now, where were we?

05:33.966 --> 05:35.934
Well...

05:36.002 --> 05:37.526
you look rested.

05:38.771 --> 05:40.033
Where's my crewmate?

05:40.106 --> 05:42.631
He should have been here by now.

05:42.709 --> 05:44.939
No doubt
he's making himself difficult.

05:45.011 --> 05:49.471
l've never seen such
an intransigent young man.

05:49.549 --> 05:51.608
You've had us in isolation
for two months.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.709
We've been scanned,
poked and prodded.

05:53.786 --> 05:55.811
How do you expect us to act?

05:55.888 --> 05:58.721
With some degree
of dignity and restraint.

05:58.791 --> 06:00.850
Your crewmate has none.

06:00.927 --> 06:02.485
What do you want from us?

06:04.464 --> 06:05.590
At the moment...

06:05.665 --> 06:07.360
information.

06:07.467 --> 06:09.594
Anything
for such a charming host.

06:09.669 --> 06:10.693
Are you all right?

06:10.770 --> 06:11.759
The galley has prepared

06:11.838 --> 06:14.306
a selection
of unique delicacies.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.774
You won't find them
anywhere else in the galaxy.

06:16.843 --> 06:18.071
Please, join me.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.212
Malkothian spirits--

06:28.287 --> 06:29.811
an extremely rare vintage.

06:29.889 --> 06:32.414
The only bottle known to exist.

06:32.525 --> 06:34.584
Your Captain said that...

06:34.660 --> 06:36.719
your vessel is trying
to reach home.

06:36.796 --> 06:39.765
l hadn't realized
how far your home was.

06:41.634 --> 06:43.659
You're an anomalous component--

06:43.736 --> 06:47.638
alone, disconnected,
impossible to predict.

06:49.475 --> 06:53.343
You have no idea how you've
complicated my mission.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.677
Glad to hear it.

06:55.748 --> 06:58.478
When l first encountered
your vessel,

06:58.584 --> 07:00.848
it was badly damaged,
barely functioning.

07:00.920 --> 07:04.185
What if l told you
that, in the blink of an eye,

07:04.257 --> 07:07.988
l could restore Voyager
to its former condition?

07:08.060 --> 07:10.654
That you and l
would never have met?

07:10.730 --> 07:12.061
That you might
even find yourself

07:12.131 --> 07:14.361
closer to the Alpha Quadrant?

07:14.434 --> 07:17.369
By using the weapon on this ship
to alter history.

07:17.503 --> 07:19.027
Yes.

07:19.105 --> 07:22.040
l can control the destiny
of a...

07:22.108 --> 07:25.407
single molecule
or an entire civilization.

07:25.478 --> 07:26.502
How's the wine?

07:27.547 --> 07:28.514
Excellent.

07:28.581 --> 07:31.175
This bottle is
the only component left

07:31.250 --> 07:33.582
of the once powerful
Malkoth race.

07:33.653 --> 07:35.416
Everything else about them--

07:35.488 --> 07:37.649
cities, culture,
the very species itself--

07:37.723 --> 07:39.281
never existed...

07:39.358 --> 07:40.689
because of me.

07:42.094 --> 07:46.360
Every dish you see here comes
from a civilization that...

07:46.432 --> 07:48.229
has been erased from time.

07:48.301 --> 07:51.668
Mr. Paris, you're devouring
the last remnants

07:51.737 --> 07:54.069
of the Alsuran Empire.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.971
l have collected artifacts
from...

07:57.810 --> 08:00.506
hundreds of worlds.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.673
This vessel is
more than a weapon.

08:04.283 --> 08:06.683
lt's a museum of lost histories.

08:09.689 --> 08:13.716
You two gentlemen almost became
artifacts yourselves.

08:15.261 --> 08:17.593
But l've decided to...

08:17.663 --> 08:19.324
spare your vessel.

08:19.398 --> 08:20.592
Why?

08:20.666 --> 08:22.531
Call it an act of compassion.

08:22.602 --> 08:24.160
You're trying to reach home.

08:24.237 --> 08:25.829
ln a way, so am l.

08:27.874 --> 08:30.672
We can work together
to achieve both our goals.

08:30.743 --> 08:33.006
What do you propose?

08:33.078 --> 08:35.639
ln order to make
the calculations required

08:35.715 --> 08:36.875
to restore Voyager,

08:36.948 --> 08:39.679
l need to know
about some of your experiences

08:39.751 --> 08:41.014
in this Quadrant--

08:41.087 --> 08:42.418
what species
you interacted with,

08:42.488 --> 08:45.048
how other components were
affected by your presence...

08:45.124 --> 08:47.319
You can't find her, can you?

08:47.393 --> 08:49.793
l think Captain Janeway
has been eluding you

08:49.862 --> 08:51.022
for the past two months.

08:51.097 --> 08:53.964
Otherwise, you would've
destroyed Voyager by now.

08:55.001 --> 08:57.435
l'm offering you
a way out of this situation.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.971
You accept my offer...

09:01.340 --> 09:03.900
or when l do find Voyager,
l will destroy it.

09:03.976 --> 09:06.945
And how many civilizations
will you have to erase

09:07.013 --> 09:08.844
to send us merrily on our way?

09:08.915 --> 09:10.041
No, thanks.

09:10.116 --> 09:11.845
We don't want that kind
of blood on our hands.

09:11.918 --> 09:13.909
Tom, hold on.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.321
You said you could control

09:17.390 --> 09:19.221
the destiny
of a single molecule.

09:19.292 --> 09:22.022
lf you made
a precise enough calculation,

09:22.094 --> 09:25.359
could you restore Voyager
without harming anyone?

09:25.464 --> 09:27.329
lt is possible...

09:27.400 --> 09:29.095
but it's extremely difficult.

09:29.168 --> 09:31.227
That's why l need
your cooperation.

09:32.538 --> 09:34.563
l'd rather spend a year
in solitary confinement

09:34.640 --> 09:35.766
than listen to any of this.

09:35.841 --> 09:36.808
Tom, have a seat.

09:36.876 --> 09:38.901
Chakotay, we can't trust him.

09:38.978 --> 09:40.878
You're correct.

09:40.947 --> 09:44.110
Given the circumstances,
there is no reason to trust me,

09:44.183 --> 09:45.980
but trust isn't necessary.

09:46.052 --> 09:47.576
We need each other.

09:50.756 --> 09:53.122
Obrist...

09:53.192 --> 09:56.320
show our guest
to his new quarters.

09:56.395 --> 09:57.657
l'll do everything in my power

09:57.730 --> 09:59.664
to make you comfortable here,
Mr. Paris.

09:59.732 --> 10:02.030
All l ask in return...

10:02.101 --> 10:04.467
is that you keep an open mind.

10:15.915 --> 10:18.042
l was very impressed
with your question.

10:18.117 --> 10:21.018
You seem to understand
the subtleties of time.

10:22.488 --> 10:25.924
Professor Vassbinder
might've disagreed with you.

10:25.992 --> 10:27.983
l failed his course
in temporal mechanics.

10:29.228 --> 10:32.459
Beyond study
and instrumentation,

10:32.531 --> 10:33.930
there is instinct.

10:35.468 --> 10:40.235
Not everyone has the ability
to truly perceive time...

10:41.407 --> 10:44.308
its colors, its moods.

10:47.213 --> 10:48.908
Perhaps you do.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.443
l'm certainly willing
to give it a try.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.280
To distant friends.

10:56.355 --> 10:57.344
To friends.

10:57.423 --> 10:58.355
Hear, hear.

10:58.424 --> 10:59.391
Cheers.

11:09.535 --> 11:11.093
Well?

11:14.540 --> 11:16.167
lnteresting.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.807
Not bad.

11:18.878 --> 11:20.140
Not bad at all.

11:20.212 --> 11:22.772
What...is it exactly?

11:22.848 --> 11:25.783
l call it"the elixir
of endurance."

11:25.851 --> 11:27.819
lt's loaded with amino acids,
carbohydrates--

11:27.887 --> 11:29.752
all the nutrients
necessary for the crew

11:29.822 --> 11:31.756
to withstand these
stressful conditions.

11:31.824 --> 11:33.086
Ration cubes.

11:33.159 --> 11:37.061
Well, yes, yes,
but this time, pureed

11:37.129 --> 11:38.096
and mixed with water

11:38.164 --> 11:39.927
and enhanced
with Talaxian spices.

11:39.999 --> 11:41.261
lt is offensive.

11:42.668 --> 11:44.431
Fortunately,
taste is irrelevant.

11:44.503 --> 11:46.494
Well, it's been a few days

11:46.639 --> 11:48.539
since we've gathered
in one place.

11:48.607 --> 11:50.438
Now's a good time to catch up.

11:50.509 --> 11:51.942
How are the repairs proceeding?

11:52.011 --> 11:53.239
l'm happy to report

11:53.312 --> 11:56.213
that l've repaired the optronic
error in my program.

11:56.282 --> 11:58.716
And the power grid.

11:58.784 --> 12:00.911
We're operating
at 32 percent efficiency.

12:00.986 --> 12:04.046
l think l can bring it up to 50,
but l'll need a few more days.

12:04.123 --> 12:05.147
Warp drive.

12:05.224 --> 12:08.159
l'm still having trouble
with the starboard nacelle.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.159
How long?

12:09.228 --> 12:11.719
Three weeks, minimum.

12:15.701 --> 12:17.692
l thought this nebula
would be a safe haven

12:17.770 --> 12:18.964
until we finished repairs,

12:19.038 --> 12:21.097
but it's turning
into a permanent residence.

12:21.173 --> 12:23.971
We've got to get back
into open space,

12:24.043 --> 12:25.374
find allies,

12:25.444 --> 12:28.845
put together a fighting force
to take on Annorax.

12:31.217 --> 12:34.209
We're leaving this damn cloud
first thing tomorrow morning.

12:34.286 --> 12:37.016
Captain, you are in error.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.352
Really?

12:39.425 --> 12:41.893
At the moment,
this vessel is defenseless.

12:41.961 --> 12:42.928
We should remain here

12:42.995 --> 12:44.860
until we are functioning
at our peak efficiency.

12:44.930 --> 12:48.491
l appreciate your opinion,
Seven, but l disagree.

12:48.567 --> 12:52.128
We leave tomorrow, 0800 hours.

12:54.740 --> 12:56.970
lt is inappropriate
to contradict the Captain

12:57.042 --> 12:58.202
in front of the crew.

12:58.277 --> 12:59.539
That was not my intention.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.012
l simply pointed out
that her decision was wrong.

13:02.114 --> 13:03.376
ln your view.

13:03.415 --> 13:04.677
And yours.

13:04.750 --> 13:06.377
l know you well enough
to say that.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.544
Then you should also know

13:07.620 --> 13:10.054
that my trust
in Captain Janeway is absolute.

13:10.122 --> 13:13.285
The decision you or l
might have made is irrelevant.

13:13.359 --> 13:16.021
As a Borg, l submitted
to a single authority--

13:16.095 --> 13:17.255
the collective.

13:17.329 --> 13:19.797
Over the past several months,
l've been encouraged

13:19.865 --> 13:21.423
to think and act
as an individual.

13:21.500 --> 13:25.300
lt is difficult to know
when to restrain myself.

13:25.371 --> 13:26.929
Remember this guideline:

13:27.006 --> 13:29.031
The Captain is always right.

13:29.108 --> 13:32.077
Even when you know
her logic is flawed?

13:33.779 --> 13:35.144
Perhaps.

13:44.490 --> 13:48.859
Component 37329-- a rogue comet.

13:48.928 --> 13:50.486
About eight months ago,

13:50.563 --> 13:51.996
Voyager made
a course correction

13:52.064 --> 13:53.031
to avoid the comet.

13:53.098 --> 13:55.464
According to my calculations,

13:55.534 --> 13:57.968
it led to our entering
Krenim space.

13:58.037 --> 13:59.800
Your solution, then, would be

13:59.872 --> 14:01.772
to erase that comet
from history.

14:01.874 --> 14:03.171
Exactly.

14:03.209 --> 14:05.143
Voyager would have
stayed on its course

14:05.211 --> 14:07.372
and bypassed Krenim
space altogether.

14:07.446 --> 14:09.812
Sounds simple enough.

14:09.882 --> 14:11.406
Conduct a simulation.

14:12.484 --> 14:14.111
Temporal incursion in progress.

14:24.163 --> 14:25.892
What happened?

14:25.965 --> 14:27.956
Had you actually
eradicated that comet,

14:28.033 --> 14:31.969
all life within 50 light- years
would never have existed.

14:32.037 --> 14:34.232
Congratulations.

14:34.306 --> 14:38.140
You almost wiped out...
8, 000 civilizations.

14:40.713 --> 14:44.376
l didn't consider
the entire history of the comet.

14:44.450 --> 14:46.884
Four billion years ago,

14:46.952 --> 14:50.285
fragments from that comet
impacted a planet.

14:50.356 --> 14:53.416
Hydrocarbons from those
fragments gave rise to

14:53.492 --> 14:56.290
several species of plant life,
which in turn,

14:56.362 --> 14:57.488
sustained
more complex organisms.

14:57.563 --> 15:01.397
Ultimately, several
space- faring civilizations

15:01.467 --> 15:04.527
evolved and colonized
the entire sector.

15:04.603 --> 15:05.934
By erasing the comet,

15:06.005 --> 15:08.735
l altered all evolution
in this region.

15:08.807 --> 15:12.800
Past, present and future--

15:13.746 --> 15:15.577
they exist as one.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.843
They breathe together.

15:21.453 --> 15:23.751
You're not the only person
to make this mistake.

15:27.026 --> 15:30.860
When l first constructed
this weapon ship,

15:30.930 --> 15:34.058
l turned it against
our greatest enemy--

15:34.133 --> 15:35.532
the Rilnar.

15:37.870 --> 15:40.202
The result was miraculous.

15:40.272 --> 15:43.332
With the Rilnar
gone from history,

15:43.409 --> 15:47.311
my people, in an instant,
became powerful again,

15:47.379 --> 15:49.779
but there were problems.

15:51.383 --> 15:54.216
A rare disease broke out
among our colonies.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.982
Within a year,
50 million were dead.

15:57.056 --> 15:59.286
l had failed to realize
that the Rilnar

15:59.358 --> 16:01.724
had introduced
a crucial antibody

16:01.827 --> 16:03.761
into the Krenim genome...

16:05.597 --> 16:09.897
and my weapon had eliminated
that antibody as well.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.335
And you've been trying to undo
that damage ever since,

16:12.404 --> 16:15.703
but each time
you pull out a new thread

16:15.774 --> 16:17.639
another one begins to unravel.

16:17.710 --> 16:21.111
You can't imagine the burden
of memory that l carry--

16:21.180 --> 16:23.671
thousands of worlds,

16:23.749 --> 16:25.740
billions of lives

16:25.818 --> 16:28.116
gone, brought back,

16:28.187 --> 16:30.087
gone again.

16:30.155 --> 16:33.249
l try to rationalize the loss.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.885
They're not
really being destroyed

16:35.961 --> 16:37.656
because they never existed.

16:39.465 --> 16:41.797
Sometimes l can...

16:41.867 --> 16:44.165
almost convince myself.

16:44.236 --> 16:46.568
You've been at this
for 200 years, Annorax.

16:46.638 --> 16:48.435
What makes you think
you're ever going to succeed?

16:48.574 --> 16:51.475
What makes you think Voyager
will ever reach Earth?

16:51.577 --> 16:55.479
The odds against you
are astronomical.

16:55.547 --> 16:58.539
Yet, you keep trying.

16:59.718 --> 17:02.346
You're right, but we
don't destroy everything

17:02.454 --> 17:03.921
that stands in our way.

17:03.989 --> 17:06.685
You can help me
to change that, Chakotay.

17:06.759 --> 17:10.661
Together, we'll restore
the Krenim and Voyager

17:10.729 --> 17:13.196
and we'll undo the damage
that l've caused.

17:14.465 --> 17:16.366
l've still got a lot to learn.

17:16.435 --> 17:17.800
Come.

17:17.869 --> 17:20.566
lt's time l show you
the heart of this vessel--

17:20.638 --> 17:21.799
the temporal core.

17:35.287 --> 17:36.584
Engines?

17:36.655 --> 17:38.020
l'm doing my best!

17:38.090 --> 17:39.580
Captain,
with the deflector down,

17:39.658 --> 17:42.149
those micro- meteoroids
are beginning to erode the hull.

17:42.227 --> 17:43.990
Emergency power
to the deflector.

17:44.063 --> 17:44.995
None available.

17:47.833 --> 17:49.892
l'll be in Deflector Control.

17:49.968 --> 17:52.061
Captain, that entire section

17:52.137 --> 17:53.604
has been designated
hazard- level 4.

17:53.672 --> 17:54.696
l know.

18:11.423 --> 18:14.051
Oh, why do l get the feeling
you're testing me, Voyager?

18:14.126 --> 18:16.356
Bridge, there's a fire
in Deflector Control.

18:16.428 --> 18:17.827
Any luck with the engines?

18:17.896 --> 18:19.454
The warp core's still off- line.

18:19.531 --> 18:22.989
Micro- meteoroid density
is increasing.

18:25.304 --> 18:28.330
The nacelle pylon is buckling.

18:35.681 --> 18:36.739
Bridge, l'm going in.

18:36.815 --> 18:38.407
Stand by
to engage the deflector.

18:38.517 --> 18:40.542
Tell the Doctor l'll be coming
back with severe burns.

18:40.619 --> 18:41.551
Captain...

18:41.620 --> 18:42.678
Do it.

18:45.390 --> 18:46.550
Be kind.

18:53.732 --> 18:56.223
The Captain's accessed
manual control.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.565
She's stabilizing
the particle emitters.

18:59.638 --> 19:00.536
She's got it.

19:00.639 --> 19:01.571
Deflector's on line.

19:01.607 --> 19:04.542
Activating deflector field.

19:04.610 --> 19:06.544
Bridge to Janeway.

19:09.414 --> 19:11.211
Captain, please respond.

19:57.095 --> 19:59.086
What's my condition?

19:59.164 --> 20:00.927
You suffered
third- degree burns

20:00.999 --> 20:03.160
to approximately
60 percent of your body.

20:03.235 --> 20:05.100
l've healed most of them,

20:05.170 --> 20:06.637
but without
a dermal regenerator,

20:06.705 --> 20:09.173
l couldn't repair
all the damage to your skin.

20:09.241 --> 20:12.972
You've been left with scars
on your face and arms.

20:16.715 --> 20:18.945
l'll consider them mementos.

20:19.017 --> 20:20.644
Not so fast.

20:20.719 --> 20:23.483
You're spending the next
few days here with me.

20:23.589 --> 20:24.613
What for?

20:24.690 --> 20:25.622
Observation.

20:25.691 --> 20:27.181
ls there something else
wrong with me?

20:27.259 --> 20:28.191
Not physically.

20:28.260 --> 20:29.989
What are you suggesting?

20:30.062 --> 20:32.121
Traumatic stress syndrome.

20:32.197 --> 20:34.495
Symptoms: irritability,
sleeplessness,

20:34.566 --> 20:37.126
obsessional thoughts,
reckless behavior--

20:37.202 --> 20:39.136
all of which
you've demonstrated

20:39.204 --> 20:40.228
over the last few weeks.

20:40.305 --> 20:44.401
My only obsession is
with saving my ship, my people.

20:44.476 --> 20:46.341
lf l've been taking
some reckless chances

20:46.411 --> 20:48.845
in order to do that, it's
hardly a medical condition.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.472
l'm not going to stand
here while you rationalize

20:50.549 --> 20:51.481
yet another brush with death.

20:51.550 --> 20:52.517
You don't have to.

20:52.584 --> 20:53.551
As Chief Medical Officer,

20:53.652 --> 20:55.449
l have the authority
to relieve you of your command.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.680
You're not going to do that.

20:56.755 --> 20:58.245
lf, in my medical opinion,

20:58.323 --> 21:01.156
your judgment has been impaired,
l can and l will.

21:01.226 --> 21:04.718
Try it and l'll shut down
your program.

21:04.796 --> 21:06.423
That threat in itself

21:06.498 --> 21:09.126
is evidence
of your unstable condition.

21:10.569 --> 21:13.333
l am sorry, Doctor.

21:13.405 --> 21:15.965
l've been operating
on instinct for so long,

21:16.041 --> 21:17.770
l did not think before l spoke.

21:17.843 --> 21:20.676
l have no intention
of deactivating you,

21:20.746 --> 21:23.408
but l won't stay
in this Mess Hall.

21:23.482 --> 21:24.414
ls that final?

21:24.483 --> 21:25.415
Final.

21:25.484 --> 21:26.508
Then you leave me no choice.

21:27.552 --> 21:29.349
Captain Kathryn Janeway,

21:29.421 --> 21:31.719
under Starfleet Medical
Regulation 121, Section A,

21:31.790 --> 21:33.985
l, the Chief Medical Officer,
do hereby relieve you

21:34.059 --> 21:37.051
of your active command,
effective immediately.

21:38.196 --> 21:39.493
Have a seat.

21:39.564 --> 21:42.658
How do you plan to implement
this protocol, Doctor?

21:42.734 --> 21:46.465
Mr. Tuvok doesn't have
a security team;

21:46.538 --> 21:48.096
both the brigs
have been destroyed;

21:48.173 --> 21:50.232
and with the internal
force fields off- line,

21:50.309 --> 21:52.243
you'll have a hell of a time
keeping me confined.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.245
You'd better grab a phaser

21:54.313 --> 21:56.281
because
before l give up command,

21:56.348 --> 21:57.781
you'll have to shoot me.

21:59.484 --> 22:03.511
You realize this incident will
be noted in my official logs.

22:03.622 --> 22:06.750
By refusing my orders, you risk
a general court- martial.

22:06.792 --> 22:09.090
Compared to what l've been
through the past few months,

22:09.161 --> 22:12.995
a court- martial would be
a small price to pay.

22:14.566 --> 22:17.000
lf we make it back home...

22:17.069 --> 22:19.037
l'll be happy to face the music.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.044
Another ruptured EPS conduit.

22:36.121 --> 22:37.053
32 so far.

22:37.122 --> 22:39.283
33, 34, 35...

22:39.358 --> 22:41.918
And that fluidic converter
needs to be purged.

22:41.993 --> 22:43.051
Right.

22:43.128 --> 22:45.323
The gravitational plating
in this room has buckled.

22:46.798 --> 22:48.493
Chakotay's quarters.

23:25.670 --> 23:27.900
You disobeyed orders.

23:27.973 --> 23:29.065
Captain?

23:31.743 --> 23:34.644
Chakotay gave this
to me five months ago--

23:34.713 --> 23:36.772
a birthday gift.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.718
l ordered him to...

23:53.331 --> 23:55.060
What do you think?

23:55.133 --> 23:56.259
Handsome.

23:58.069 --> 23:59.297
Come on.

24:08.847 --> 24:10.314
Astounding.

24:10.382 --> 24:12.043
Not really.

24:12.117 --> 24:13.880
l get lucky now and again.

24:13.952 --> 24:16.580
Uh, your end game sequence,
it, uh...

24:16.655 --> 24:18.782
it was the same one
favored by my brother.

24:18.857 --> 24:22.122
To quote a long- lost friend
of mine:

24:22.194 --> 24:24.185
"lt seemed logical."

24:28.133 --> 24:29.464
Now what?

24:32.103 --> 24:36.164
l used to honor
the day of his birth.

24:36.241 --> 24:37.208
Who?

24:37.275 --> 24:39.334
My brother.

24:41.813 --> 24:44.179
And my parents,
my closest friends.

24:44.249 --> 24:46.479
Every year, at first.

24:46.551 --> 24:50.954
Then one day, l realized
a century had passed...

24:51.022 --> 24:54.150
and for years, l had been
celebrating birthdays...

24:57.295 --> 24:58.523
for the dead.

24:59.698 --> 25:01.290
Mmm.

25:01.399 --> 25:04.129
Or for people
who never even existed.

25:07.772 --> 25:09.171
l'm sorry.

25:16.248 --> 25:18.341
You can put that thing down,
Chakotay.

25:18.416 --> 25:20.816
No need to strain your eyes
anymore.

25:20.886 --> 25:21.978
l've got a plan.

25:22.053 --> 25:23.145
Let's hear it.

25:23.221 --> 25:24.415
This ship's temporal core

25:24.523 --> 25:26.388
keeps the vessel out of phase
with normal space- time,

25:26.458 --> 25:28.858
but its shields
are incredibly weak.

25:28.927 --> 25:31.896
You take that core off- line,
and a photon grenade

25:31.963 --> 25:33.624
could penetrate the hull.

25:33.698 --> 25:35.063
How do you know all this?

25:35.133 --> 25:38.830
l've been spending time
with our friend Obrist,

25:38.904 --> 25:41.429
who seems more than willing
to share information.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.474
And that's not all.

25:43.575 --> 25:45.907
Does the name Captain Bligh
mean anything to you?

25:45.977 --> 25:49.276
This is not a happy crew.

25:49.347 --> 25:50.974
They've been at this
for 200 years now.

25:51.049 --> 25:52.380
They're tired of it, Chakotay.

25:52.450 --> 25:53.417
They want it to end.

25:57.155 --> 25:58.816
Good work, Tom,

25:58.890 --> 26:00.755
but l'm not quite ready
to start a mutiny.

26:00.859 --> 26:02.258
Keep gathering information.

26:02.294 --> 26:03.693
Lie low.

26:03.762 --> 26:06.458
l'm starting to make progress
on the temporal calculations.

26:06.531 --> 26:08.362
With a little time and luck,

26:08.433 --> 26:10.731
l think we can get
the Krenim back on their feet

26:10.802 --> 26:13.066
and Voyager back
to the Alpha Quadrant.

26:13.138 --> 26:15.538
You're starting to sound
like Annorax--

26:15.607 --> 26:17.234
always one more calculation.

26:17.309 --> 26:18.469
This time it's going
to be perfect.

26:18.543 --> 26:19.510
This can work.

26:19.578 --> 26:20.977
lf you'd take time to listen,

26:21.046 --> 26:23.037
you'd understand what Annorax
is trying to do.

26:23.114 --> 26:25.742
What? Wipe out civilizations
to help his own race?

26:25.817 --> 26:27.045
l understand perfectly.

26:27.118 --> 26:29.712
lt's more complicated
than that.

26:32.157 --> 26:34.421
Annorax is an enlightened man--

26:34.492 --> 26:36.756
misguided, but l think
he wants this to end

26:36.828 --> 26:37.988
as much as anyone.

26:38.063 --> 26:41.430
l guess l don't have
the instinct for time--

26:41.499 --> 26:44.525
or whatever it is Captain Nemo
out there calls it.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.230
Chakotay, he's been
flattering you

26:46.304 --> 26:47.669
and it's gone to your head.

26:47.739 --> 26:49.172
You're out of line, Lieutenant.

26:51.943 --> 26:54.275
Maybe l shouldn't
start a mutiny,

26:54.346 --> 26:55.472
but l might be able
to get Obrist

26:55.580 --> 26:57.309
to help us send a message
to Captain Janeway.

26:57.382 --> 27:00.715
Not yet-- if you get caught,
we lose everything.

27:00.785 --> 27:01.809
l can get us out of this.

27:01.886 --> 27:03.615
Not if l can get us
out of here first.

27:03.688 --> 27:06.589
You're not doing anything
against Annorax.

27:06.658 --> 27:08.319
That's an order.

27:10.061 --> 27:11.153
What are you going to do,

27:11.229 --> 27:12.628
take away
my holodeck privileges?

27:12.697 --> 27:16.133
Either we maintain
our command structure

27:16.201 --> 27:17.691
or else
we settle our differences

27:17.769 --> 27:18.827
the old- fashioned way.

27:24.275 --> 27:25.242
What's happening?

27:25.310 --> 27:27.073
We're preparing
for a temporal incursion.

27:27.145 --> 27:28.077
What incursion?

27:28.146 --> 27:29.078
You didn't say anything...

27:29.147 --> 27:30.409
l had an inspiration
last night.

27:30.482 --> 27:31.414
By my calculations,

27:31.483 --> 27:33.314
the eradication
of the Ram lzad species

27:33.385 --> 27:35.649
will result
in a 52 percent restoration

27:35.720 --> 27:37.085
of the Krenim timeline.

27:37.155 --> 27:39.180
l thought we were working
to avoid more destruction.

27:39.257 --> 27:41.350
When time offers you
an opportunity,

27:41.426 --> 27:42.950
you don't ignore it.

27:43.028 --> 27:45.326
We're within range
of their homeworld.

27:46.698 --> 27:48.063
Take us into orbit.

27:48.133 --> 27:49.600
Full power to the weapon.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.568
Prepare for total erasure.

27:52.804 --> 27:54.863
ls this what you call
enlightened?

27:54.939 --> 27:56.600
Targeting the focal point.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.836
Locked.

27:58.910 --> 28:00.707
Please, this isn't necessary.

28:00.812 --> 28:02.279
We'll find another way.

28:09.754 --> 28:11.187
Fire.

28:17.228 --> 28:18.695
Trace elements?

28:18.763 --> 28:21.095
Diminishing.

28:21.166 --> 28:22.929
Counter- indications.

28:23.001 --> 28:24.662
None so far.

28:24.736 --> 28:26.363
Scan the continuum.

28:26.504 --> 28:28.199
Bring me the results
once they're complete.

28:28.273 --> 28:29.240
Yes, sir.

28:29.307 --> 28:31.070
l'll be in my chambers.

28:36.014 --> 28:38.778
Have you seen enough
yet, Chakotay?

28:38.850 --> 28:42.445
lf you don't do something
about this maniac, l will.

28:56.201 --> 28:58.192
You didn't need
to fire on that planet.

28:58.269 --> 29:02.205
l'm altering history
on a massive scale.

29:02.307 --> 29:05.640
The destinies of countless
star systems are in my hands.

29:05.677 --> 29:08.441
The fate of one species
is insignificant.

29:08.513 --> 29:10.708
You're trying
to rationalize genocide.

29:10.782 --> 29:12.340
One species is significant.

29:12.450 --> 29:14.281
A single life is significant.

29:19.724 --> 29:22.488
lt seemed so...

29:22.560 --> 29:25.358
easy the first time.

29:25.430 --> 29:30.663
ln the blink of an eye,
l had changed history itself,

29:30.735 --> 29:33.067
allowed my people
to thrive again.

29:35.673 --> 29:39.109
But when l changed history
a second time,

29:39.177 --> 29:42.169
l lost more
than you can imagine.

29:42.247 --> 29:44.181
The colony on Kyana Prime.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.245
How could you know that?

29:48.319 --> 29:51.755
l've been studying
your previous incursions.

29:51.823 --> 29:54.849
No matter how close you get
to restoring the timeline,

29:54.926 --> 29:57.190
one component
is always missing...

29:57.262 --> 29:58.752
Kyana Prime.

30:01.266 --> 30:03.063
Who was on that colony?

30:03.134 --> 30:05.193
Who did you lose?

30:05.270 --> 30:07.431
My wife...

30:07.572 --> 30:09.096
and with her, my future.

30:09.174 --> 30:12.473
My children, grandchildren--

30:12.577 --> 30:14.772
all erased because of me.

30:17.615 --> 30:19.879
This is all l have left of her.

30:19.951 --> 30:22.920
So many years
l worked through the night

30:22.987 --> 30:24.477
while she was sleeping.

30:24.556 --> 30:27.491
How could l have known l was...

30:27.559 --> 30:30.824
calculating her fate?

30:30.895 --> 30:34.854
l can't stop
until l've restored Kyana Prime

30:34.933 --> 30:37.094
and forced time
to give me back my wife.

30:37.168 --> 30:38.965
Maybe it isn't possible.

30:39.037 --> 30:42.996
When l tell you
that time has moods...

30:43.074 --> 30:45.542
a disposition to be intuited...

30:45.610 --> 30:47.100
l'm not speaking metaphorically.

30:47.178 --> 30:48.645
What do you mean?

30:48.713 --> 30:50.943
Anger is one of its moods--

30:51.015 --> 30:53.984
anger and the desire for...

30:54.052 --> 30:56.987
retribution, vengeance.

30:57.055 --> 31:01.719
Time itself has tried
to punish me for my arrogance.

31:01.793 --> 31:05.092
lt has kept me from my wife,
denied me my future.

31:06.264 --> 31:09.995
Sir, we've achieved
a 52 percent restoration.

31:10.068 --> 31:12.298
Kyana Prime?

31:13.404 --> 31:14.894
Negative, sir.

31:17.675 --> 31:20.007
Resume scanning the continuum.

31:20.078 --> 31:21.067
Yes, sir.

31:26.784 --> 31:28.445
l've, uh...

31:30.121 --> 31:31.918
l've studied your calculations,
Chakotay.

31:31.990 --> 31:35.983
They're promising...

31:36.060 --> 31:37.288
premature.

31:38.329 --> 31:40.024
We'll keep working on them.

31:40.098 --> 31:43.124
ln the meantime,
my mission must continue.

31:43.201 --> 31:44.498
You don't have the right...

31:44.569 --> 31:46.002
To fight for what is mine?

31:46.070 --> 31:48.664
That's not for you to decide.

31:48.740 --> 31:52.574
Only time can pronounce
judgment against me.

31:59.651 --> 32:01.516
lf that little display
doesn't convince you,

32:01.619 --> 32:02.643
l don't know what will.

32:02.687 --> 32:03.619
He's insane.

32:03.688 --> 32:04.814
No, he's not.

32:04.889 --> 32:05.947
Wounded maybe,

32:06.024 --> 32:08.515
even tortured,
but l can still reach him...

32:08.593 --> 32:09.719
convince him to stop.

32:09.794 --> 32:11.421
Not from what you've told me.

32:11.529 --> 32:15.898
This guy thinks that time has
a personal grudge against him.

32:15.967 --> 32:17.935
That's called paranoia,
Chakotay,

32:18.002 --> 32:19.367
with a hint of megalomania.

32:19.437 --> 32:20.802
You don't know
what he's been through.

32:21.973 --> 32:23.838
He's lost his family.

32:23.908 --> 32:25.136
Okay, that's a terrible thing,

32:25.209 --> 32:27.234
but so has everyone else
on this ship,

32:27.312 --> 32:29.007
and frankly, so have we!

32:32.717 --> 32:34.548
What kind of progress
have you made?

32:36.120 --> 32:38.452
Obrist is coming around...

32:38.523 --> 32:40.115
and l think we can trust him.

32:40.191 --> 32:43.490
He says he'll give me access
to their communications array.

32:43.561 --> 32:45.028
l can send a message to Voyager

32:45.096 --> 32:46.757
from the comfort
of my own quarters.

32:46.831 --> 32:48.958
And the temporal core?

32:49.033 --> 32:50.660
That's going to be
a little trickier.

32:50.735 --> 32:53.499
With Obrist's help, l'm
pretty sure l can disable it,

32:53.571 --> 32:57.029
but not without setting off
every alarm on this ship.

32:57.108 --> 32:58.939
We're only going
to have one chance.

32:59.010 --> 33:00.272
lt'll require precise timing.

33:00.378 --> 33:01.868
You and me
working from within...

33:01.913 --> 33:04.746
And Captain Janeway
attacking from Voyager.

33:05.917 --> 33:09.785
That is...
if the Captain's still alive.

33:09.854 --> 33:11.151
She's alive.

33:14.892 --> 33:16.416
Send the message.

33:16.494 --> 33:17.518
Transmit our coordinates.

33:17.595 --> 33:18.527
Done.

33:18.596 --> 33:20.791
And...

33:20.865 --> 33:22.298
give Kathryn my best.

33:30.341 --> 33:34.471
Captain's Log, Stardate 51682. 2.

33:34.579 --> 33:36.706
l've forged a coalition
with the Nihydron

33:36.781 --> 33:38.009
and the Mawasi.

33:38.082 --> 33:40.812
Together, we're preparing
to attack the weapon ship.

33:40.885 --> 33:43.115
l've analyzed
every carrier frequency

33:43.187 --> 33:44.484
of their transmission.

33:44.589 --> 33:48.685
lt contains a classified
Starfleet lD code

33:48.760 --> 33:52.161
that could only have
come from Tom Paris.

33:52.230 --> 33:54.289
lt's real.

33:54.365 --> 33:55.491
The coordinates he sent

33:55.566 --> 33:58.057
should lead us directly
to the weapon ship.

33:58.136 --> 33:59.068
Location?

33:59.137 --> 34:01.697
Approximately
50 light- years from here.

34:01.806 --> 34:05.105
Our new allies are
assembling reinforcements.

34:05.143 --> 34:07.941
Once we're in range,
Tom says he'll try

34:08.012 --> 34:10.411
to take the weapon ship
temporal core off- line.

34:10.514 --> 34:11.743
When that happens,

34:11.815 --> 34:13.681
they'll be vulnerable
to conventional weapons.

34:13.751 --> 34:17.619
Tom will then transmit
the exact location of the core.

34:17.688 --> 34:19.815
Our job will be
to disable the ship

34:19.891 --> 34:20.983
and get our people out.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.025
ls everyone clear?

34:22.092 --> 34:23.424
- Yes, ma'am.
- Aye, Captain.

34:24.695 --> 34:25.821
B'Elanna, Harry,

34:25.897 --> 34:27.592
l want you to beam over
to the Nihydron vessel.

34:27.665 --> 34:29.530
Work with their engineers.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.329
The entire fleet
needs to be equipped

34:31.402 --> 34:32.527
with temporal shielding.

34:32.603 --> 34:33.433
Aye, Captain.

34:33.571 --> 34:36.768
Tuvok, Neelix, Seven,

34:36.841 --> 34:38.433
you'll be working
on the Mawasi ship.

34:38.543 --> 34:39.532
Yes, Captain.

34:40.678 --> 34:43.168
Doctor, once the attack begins,

34:43.246 --> 34:46.478
your skills
will no doubt be required.

34:46.551 --> 34:47.882
Join Tuvok's team.

34:47.952 --> 34:49.248
What about yourself?

34:49.320 --> 34:51.982
l'll be piloting Voyager,
coordinating the attack.

34:52.056 --> 34:53.284
Captain,

34:53.357 --> 34:55.484
there's barely enough
of this ship left to get there,

34:55.560 --> 34:57.152
much less wage a war.

34:57.228 --> 34:59.321
There's fight in Voyager yet.

34:59.397 --> 35:01.422
lt's still got
temporal shields...

35:01.532 --> 35:02.931
six photon torpedoes.

35:02.967 --> 35:04.696
lt'll hold together.

35:04.769 --> 35:07.465
Besides, you know the adage--

35:07.538 --> 35:10.234
Captain goes down
with the ship, right?

35:10.308 --> 35:11.798
You have your orders.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.104
Dismissed.

35:27.625 --> 35:30.788
Tuvok, l can hear
your objections already.

35:30.862 --> 35:32.227
l am not leaving.

35:32.296 --> 35:34.662
Given Voyager's damaged state,

35:34.732 --> 35:36.825
the probability
of your surviving

35:36.901 --> 35:38.869
an armed conflict is marginal.

35:38.936 --> 35:42.531
Oh, l know the odds,
but l have to stay.

35:44.108 --> 35:46.167
Voyager's done too much for us.

35:48.412 --> 35:49.845
Curious.

35:49.914 --> 35:51.472
l have never understood
the human compulsion

35:51.549 --> 35:54.814
to emotionally bond
with inanimate objects.

35:54.886 --> 35:57.650
This vessel has done nothing.

35:57.722 --> 35:59.485
lt is an assemblage

35:59.557 --> 36:02.890
of bulkheads, conduits,
tritanium...

36:02.994 --> 36:04.393
nothing more.

36:04.462 --> 36:05.952
Oh, you're wrong.

36:07.732 --> 36:10.599
lt's much more than that.

36:10.668 --> 36:13.159
This ship has been our home.

36:13.237 --> 36:14.898
lt's kept us together.

36:14.972 --> 36:17.406
lt's been part of our family.

36:17.475 --> 36:20.171
As illogical
as this might sound...

36:20.244 --> 36:22.235
l feel as close to Voyager

36:22.313 --> 36:24.645
as l do to any other member
of my crew.

36:24.715 --> 36:26.580
lt's carried us, Tuvok...

36:26.651 --> 36:30.052
even nurtured us...

36:30.121 --> 36:33.113
and right now,
it needs one of us.

36:34.692 --> 36:37.126
l respect your decision.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.895
Live long and prosper, Captain.

36:50.575 --> 36:51.599
Same to you...

36:53.177 --> 36:54.974
old friend.

38:02.546 --> 38:04.343
Voyager to Mawasi vessel.

38:04.415 --> 38:05.746
Go ahead, Captain.

38:05.816 --> 38:08.785
l'm picking up the weapon ship,
dead ahead.

38:08.853 --> 38:10.081
Confirmed.

38:10.154 --> 38:12.088
Temporal shields status.

38:12.156 --> 38:14.784
All vessels are bringing them
on line.

38:22.033 --> 38:23.967
This is Captain Janeway
to the fleet.

38:24.035 --> 38:26.799
Plot an intercept course
to the weapon ship.

38:30.474 --> 38:32.237
Sir, six vessels are
approaching our position.

38:32.310 --> 38:33.242
ldentify.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.973
Three Nihydron warships,
two Mawasi cruisers...

38:36.047 --> 38:37.241
and Voyager.

38:38.516 --> 38:41.178
We're outside space- time,
impervious to their weapons.

38:41.252 --> 38:42.480
Let them come.

38:43.921 --> 38:45.081
l know Captain Janeway.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.418
She wouldn't be attacking

38:46.490 --> 38:48.515
unless she knew she
could do some damage.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.799
Good work, Obrist.

38:59.470 --> 39:01.870
lf she's given the other
ships temporal shielding,

39:01.972 --> 39:03.906
they've undoubtedly
informed their homeworlds.

39:03.941 --> 39:06.842
They'll be able to protect their
planets against your weapon.

39:08.379 --> 39:10.779
Bring the weapon to full power.

39:10.848 --> 39:13.510
Stand by
for multiple incursions.

39:13.584 --> 39:17.782
We'll have to disable
their temporal shields first.

39:17.855 --> 39:20.653
Make the necessary calculations.

39:20.725 --> 39:23.091
All vessels report ready.

39:23.160 --> 39:25.651
Let's see if Tom
has done his part.

39:25.730 --> 39:28.198
Janeway to the fleet.

39:28.265 --> 39:30.859
Attack pattern omega.

39:30.935 --> 39:32.163
Engage.

39:38.743 --> 39:39.732
Condition?

39:39.810 --> 39:41.801
No damage.

39:41.879 --> 39:43.540
Temporal core is stable.

39:43.614 --> 39:44.876
Return fire.

39:51.389 --> 39:55.621
Captain, two Nihydron vessels
have been destroyed.

39:57.495 --> 39:58.723
Janeway to the fleet.

39:58.796 --> 40:01.526
Evasive pattern delta.
We're going to have to wait.

40:01.599 --> 40:03.157
Come on, Tom.
Come on.

40:05.369 --> 40:06.859
Target the other vessels.

40:13.711 --> 40:16.441
Obrist...
l said target the vessels.

40:23.988 --> 40:26.218
You're deactivating
the temporal core.

40:27.558 --> 40:29.253
l'm sorry, sir.

40:29.326 --> 40:30.588
lt's over.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.235
Get back to your stations.

40:38.302 --> 40:40.133
You will not disobey me.

40:42.006 --> 40:44.600
We're phasing back
into normal space- time.

40:44.675 --> 40:48.008
Reconfigure
to conventional weapons.

40:49.680 --> 40:53.081
Captain, Chakotay and Paris
were beamed aboard our vessel.

40:53.150 --> 40:56.244
Everything's going as planned.

40:56.320 --> 40:57.719
Tom sent me the coordinates

40:57.788 --> 40:59.756
of their temporal core
before he left.

40:59.824 --> 41:03.385
l'm transmitting them
to you now.

41:03.494 --> 41:07.191
Conventional weapons are on line
and fully charged, sir.

41:07.231 --> 41:08.721
Fire at will!

41:58.549 --> 42:00.847
Sir, weapons are back
to full capacity.

42:00.951 --> 42:02.248
Target Voyager.

42:02.286 --> 42:05.050
Put Janeway out of her misery.

42:05.122 --> 42:07.784
All our ships
have been disabled, Captain.

42:07.858 --> 42:09.587
Do you have weapons?

42:09.660 --> 42:12.527
Negative.
Torpedo launchers are down.

42:12.596 --> 42:14.860
l'm setting a collision course.

42:17.034 --> 42:18.558
Janeway to the fleet.

42:18.636 --> 42:21.002
Take your temporal shields
off- line.

42:21.071 --> 42:22.800
Captain, we won't be protected.

42:22.873 --> 42:24.534
Exactly.

42:24.608 --> 42:26.132
lf that ship is destroyed,

42:26.210 --> 42:28.940
all of history
might be restored,

42:29.013 --> 42:31.743
and this is one year
l'd like to forget.

42:36.487 --> 42:38.352
Time's...up.

42:56.740 --> 42:58.833
The core is destabilizing.

42:58.909 --> 43:00.274
lt's going to cause
a temporal incursion

43:00.377 --> 43:01.401
within the ship.

43:24.668 --> 43:28.968
Captain's Log, Stardate 51252. 3.

43:29.039 --> 43:31.132
The past couple of weeks
have been uneventful,

43:31.208 --> 43:32.402
but we've made
excellent progress

43:32.476 --> 43:34.740
on the new Astrometrics Lab.

43:34.812 --> 43:36.404
When can you bring it on line?

43:36.480 --> 43:38.380
We just did.

43:38.449 --> 43:41.475
ln fact, we're in the process
of charting a new course home.

43:41.552 --> 43:43.577
l'd say this is cause
for celebration.

43:43.654 --> 43:45.986
A vessel is approaching
off the port bow, Captain.

43:46.056 --> 43:47.523
On screen.

43:49.226 --> 43:50.488
They're hailing us.

43:50.561 --> 43:51.585
Open a channel.

43:51.662 --> 43:54.995
You've entered Krenim space.

43:55.065 --> 43:56.692
State your identity.

43:56.767 --> 43:59.327
Captain Janeway
of the Starship Voyager.

43:59.403 --> 44:01.132
We're just passing through,
trying to get home.

44:01.238 --> 44:02.398
This region is in dispute.

44:02.473 --> 44:04.941
l suggest
you avoid our territory.

44:05.009 --> 44:06.533
Thanks for the warning.

44:06.610 --> 44:08.601
Good journey.

44:10.147 --> 44:12.615
Tom, plot a course
around Krenim space.

44:12.683 --> 44:14.082
Aye, sir.

44:14.151 --> 44:15.516
So what do you think?

44:15.586 --> 44:18.146
How about a ground- breaking
ceremony for our new lab?

44:18.222 --> 44:19.519
Sounds great.

44:19.590 --> 44:22.218
l think l'll replicate
a bottle of Saint Emilion

44:22.292 --> 44:23.384
for the occasion.

44:23.460 --> 44:27.794
2370--
l hear that was a good year.

44:32.970 --> 44:34.096
Good morning.

44:37.041 --> 44:38.338
Good morning.

44:42.179 --> 44:44.374
Join me for breakfast?

44:44.448 --> 44:45.881
ln a little while.

44:45.949 --> 44:49.476
l still have a...
few more calculations.

44:49.553 --> 44:50.986
There are always

44:51.055 --> 44:53.114
"a few more calculations."

44:53.190 --> 44:55.681
lt's a beautiful day.

44:55.759 --> 44:58.193
Spend it with me.

45:01.465 --> 45:03.194
l suppose l can make the time.
