00:27.499 --> 00:31.777
In my dream I Tolak Zed, rescuing "Sirena" the evil prefect.

00:33.278 --> 00:35.555
Help me, Johnny!

00:44.856 --> 00:46.444
Did these men are bothering you?

00:48.045 --> 00:50.444
Lárgate, Spud.

01:08.545 --> 01:11.788
Johnny, you're a real badass.

01:11.789 --> 01:14.556
And she has never wanted sex with Hugh Hefner and ...

01:14.557 --> 01:17.266
... Best of all for her'm not a Spud.

01:24.267 --> 01:25.888
Do you mind if I were one?

01:25.889 --> 01:28.500
Can you? Please.

01:37.801 --> 01:39.389
Not so fast, my friend.

01:39.490 --> 01:41.444
You've been a child really, really bad.

01:41.445 --> 01:42.845
¿Christine?

01:43.546 --> 01:44.840
Why always me touch your breasts?

01:44.841 --> 01:46.589
Why do not you kiss me when you had the chance?

01:46.590 --> 01:47.444
Ramero child.

02:08.209 --> 02:10.223
I can not believe it! All holiday ...

02:10.223 --> 02:12.378
... My voice sounded like a constipated donkey.

02:12.379 --> 02:13.844
And now it has finally happened.

02:15.245 --> 02:16.866
I have hair on the balls.

02:17.867 --> 02:21.399
They may only be three, but the revolution has definitely begun.

02:22.300 --> 02:26.500
Goodbye childhood, and welcome the explosive and constant sex with my girlfriend.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.589
Mom is-What time is it?

02:51.890 --> 02:53.555
... It is time ... to leave.

02:53.956 --> 02:56.188
We're going .. just ... yeah.

03:04.289 --> 03:06.144
My parents were driving me crazy.

03:06.345 --> 03:09.923
I mean, I can handle sex, to drink and discuss,

03:09.924 --> 03:11.900
- I heard you say. - I just was-

03:11.901 --> 03:14.839
But now Mom is thinking of emigrating to England after ...

03:14.840 --> 03:17.777
... That the president announced plans for new legislation.

03:18.278 --> 03:20.666
I heard that the neighbors are selling.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.088
- It's very serious. - What?

03:23.089 --> 03:25.609
Going to be Sodom and Gomorrah.

03:25.610 --> 03:28.292
Apparently it's a matter of time before we are all ...

03:28.293 --> 03:30.809
... Violated in our beds by Innocence and friends.

03:30.810 --> 03:33.189
- Hello how are you? - Did you sleep well?

03:33.190 --> 03:35.800
- You want some coffee? - Maybe some biscuits.

03:35.801 --> 03:37.333
Yes. Sugar?

03:39.334 --> 03:41.289
No way I'm going to emigrate.

03:41.390 --> 03:43.600
It took a whole year to grab value to kiss ...

03:43.601 --> 03:45.899
... "Sirena" and now I will not throw that away.

03:45.900 --> 03:48.000
In addition, we are in love.

04:12.601 --> 04:14.507
I never cared that it was awarded a scholarship in ...

04:14.508 --> 04:16.488
... One of the most prestigious schools in the country.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.666
Actually I do not even mind the scholarship.

04:19.666 --> 04:22.333
I mean, of course my parents could not afford to send me here.

04:22.834 --> 04:25.369
But the real reason we need this school,

04:25.370 --> 04:28.293
even though it is governed as a dictatorship with silly ...

04:28.294 --> 04:31.259
... Narcissistic and abusive rules, the real reason is because ...

04:31.260 --> 04:34.000
... It has the most crazy and insane vandals worldwide.

04:37.901 --> 04:39.299
The "Eight Crazy."

04:41.800 --> 04:45.000
And our first work will throw Vern to the source!

04:58.701 --> 05:03.869
Wilson, if you can not control these guys, I'll find someone who can.

05:06.770 --> 05:11.044
Hey, what are you doing? I want everyone in my office to that already!

05:11.345 --> 05:14.609
"Costilla," our sadistic supervising teacher.

05:14.610 --> 05:16.888
After our remarkable resistance to the lashes,

05:16.889 --> 05:19.289
I'm sure that has something up his sleeve unpleasant.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.222
Does anyone?

05:40.323 --> 05:44.466
Significa compórtense
o váyanse a la f...

05:46.067 --> 05:48.344
Do I make myself clear, gentlemen?

05:51.445 --> 05:52.445
What?

05:52.446 --> 05:54.489
Sorry, sir, I'm confused.

05:54.490 --> 05:56.788
What did he mean by that "F"?

06:02.389 --> 06:04.555
I must warn you, boy.

06:04.556 --> 06:06.999
He estado ejercitándome.

06:16.600 --> 06:21.899
Well, enjoy the anticipation, I'll be watching.

06:22.700 --> 06:24.100
Retírense.

06:24.501 --> 06:28.909
If "Costilla" want to drive the crazy, you will have to try harder.

06:30.110 --> 06:32.038
For starters, Rambo said he planned ...

06:32.039 --> 06:34.291
... Teach the wife of "rib" a lot of ...

06:34.292 --> 06:36.666
... New sex positions learned during the holidays.

06:42.367 --> 06:45.788
Oh, you would catch "mad dog" causing terror in the freshmen.

06:49.689 --> 06:51.598
In fact the new guys have so much ...

06:51.599 --> 06:53.589
... Afraid to do whatever he says.

06:53.590 --> 06:56.088
Get down! Lizards!

06:57.289 --> 06:58.544
Well, become the dead.

07:03.245 --> 07:06.999
Or you could catch "brat" with his epic collection of international porn.

07:07.800 --> 07:08.800
Ready, look at this.

07:09.801 --> 07:10.801
Who is that?

07:10.802 --> 07:12.900
- A sex machine. - Are implants?

07:12.901 --> 07:15.444
- No, look at them well. - Look, keep watching.

07:16.445 --> 07:20.089
- Is that Christine? - No, no, you'd be dead.

07:20.490 --> 07:23.111
It is the film "Brat" killed by Christine.

07:23.512 --> 07:24.999
How we're going to believe?

07:25.000 --> 07:27.888
"Greasy" is also seriously violating school rules.

07:27.889 --> 07:30.700
Saving supermarket more than half under the bed.

07:31.601 --> 07:33.571
The he accumulated during the holidays and said that ...

07:33.572 --> 07:35.500
... Only saved when price rise.

07:38.301 --> 07:41.061
Simon is in danger because constantly skip class ...

07:41.062 --> 07:44.044
... To practice their shooting and ligand girls through the defense.

07:45.145 --> 07:47.510
And Vern has become a kleptomaniac as long feed ...

07:47.511 --> 07:50.033
... Her unhealthy addiction to the solution for contact lenses.

07:53.834 --> 07:56.817
Everyone is probably safe as Roger the cat ...

07:56.818 --> 07:59.700
... Was adopted as an honorary member at the eight crazy.

08:01.201 --> 08:04.526
As for me, this year I plan to keep my nose ...

08:04.527 --> 08:07.489
... Clean and avoid disaster, death and shame.

08:08.790 --> 08:11.899
I will work hard and become world famous actor.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.702
And a siren day and I walk through ...

08:14.703 --> 08:17.700
... The red carpet as Richard Gere and Cindy Crawfort.

08:24.701 --> 08:25.701
Come on.

08:27.502 --> 08:28.999
Come on, are not chickens.

08:30.400 --> 08:31.666
Rambo, what are we doing here?

08:31.867 --> 08:33.849
If someone catches us entering the office ...

08:33.850 --> 08:35.999
Director ... we'll be in serious trouble.

08:43.500 --> 08:46.909
The largest and most insane madness of the year had not yet begun.

08:47.410 --> 08:48.610
Come on, everyone.

08:51.211 --> 08:53.273
Everything was Rambo said,

08:53.274 --> 08:56.999
"It's time to stop being children and become legends."

09:01.800 --> 09:05.099
Boys, welcome to the legendary wall of fame.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.111
Whose are these names?

09:10.712 --> 09:16.444
Spud, are all guys who told the Director to the goal.

09:17.745 --> 09:20.000
I bet that "Glock" has not even checked under his old desk.

09:21.001 --> 09:22.600
How did you hear about this?

09:24.501 --> 09:27.888
Haywire Mckenzie who was expelled for eating consideration.

09:28.689 --> 09:29.889
He vomited here.

09:32.090 --> 09:36.189
You see guys, not everyone can make their names under this desk.

09:37.490 --> 09:40.555
- Until then ... - Or I can do it again.

09:41.556 --> 09:45.111
No, can not. Everything we have done are a few nocturnal escapades.

09:45.112 --> 09:47.000
Nor even we deserve to be here.

09:47.801 --> 09:48.801
Let's go.

09:51.702 --> 09:52.702
"Mocoso"

09:56.103 --> 09:59.466
This is where our quest to become legends begins.

10:00.067 --> 10:03.333
The Nutties Farm Show, the competition eating hot dogs.

10:03.534 --> 10:06.888
The prize is $ 500.

10:06.889 --> 10:08.189
Seboso can do to sleep.

10:10.090 --> 10:13.444
Greasy, you can win this.

10:13.445 --> 10:15.300
- Yes. - You're our man.

10:15.301 --> 10:17.852
What we will do with the money?

10:17.853 --> 10:21.111
Brat, let's put this school head.

10:21.112 --> 10:22.112
Sounds legenda-

10:22.113 --> 10:24.555
But I thought that only the prefects were allowed to go.

10:24.556 --> 10:26.666
Not if Costilla gives us a weekend pass.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.167
Yeah, like that was going to happen.

10:29.868 --> 10:31.788
A heel passes weekend.

10:33.889 --> 10:35.555
I wonder how you get it from your desk.

10:36.056 --> 10:37.456
Well played.

10:57.023 --> 10:58.444
What the hell are you doing here?

10:58.445 --> 11:01.222
La Granja is only for seniors, morons.

11:01.223 --> 11:03.788
Mr. Wilson gave us passes weekend.

11:03.789 --> 11:04.911
Nonsense, show me.

11:05.512 --> 11:07.596
The Head of the House, Greg Anderson and prefect ...

11:07.597 --> 11:09.766
... Guy Hamilton house and "mortal breath."

11:09.767 --> 11:10.767
¡Jump!

11:13.468 --> 11:17.046
Undoubtedly the most sadistic kids who have walked by the school.

11:18.747 --> 11:20.189
After Mad Dog, of course.

11:22.190 --> 11:23.999
¿Van a entrar a la
competencia de Hot Dogs?

11:24.000 --> 11:26.688
- I'll make you fall. - But do not get ahead.

11:26.689 --> 11:28.289
Shut your mouth!

11:29.090 --> 11:31.045
How about some idiots like you bring the money to go?

11:33.346 --> 11:36.777
- I do not think so. - The preparation, stinks.

11:43.378 --> 11:44.378
How we have altogether?

11:44.379 --> 11:46.666
- How much will it cost? - Do not mention the posters.

11:46.667 --> 11:48.999
- Nobody told us anything. - Do not mention anything?

11:49.000 --> 11:51.400
- Why did they do? - You have to pay for the Hot Dogs.

11:55.801 --> 12:01.084
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to "help the needy," performed ...

12:01.085 --> 12:06.222
... By John Milton. Please donate generously to this worthy cause.

12:08.023 --> 12:09.023
Thank you.

12:19.624 --> 12:24.444
# Bring me my bow of burning gold #

12:24.555 --> 12:29.709
# Bring me my arrows of desire #

12:29.789 --> 12:35.100
# Bring me my spear, oh, Disperse clouds #

12:35.101 --> 12:40.000
# Bring me my chariot of fire #

12:40.001 --> 12:44.609
# I will not cease my mental struggle #

12:45.010 --> 12:49.111
# And the sword sleep in my hand #

12:49.112 --> 12:54.099
# Until we have built Jerusalem #

12:54.400 --> 13:02.444
# In the green and pleasant land of England #

13:09.889 --> 13:11.999
It's for a good cause, ladies and gentlemen.

13:13.300 --> 13:14.300
It's for a good cause.

13:28.900 --> 13:31.489
- Why are we here? - Do not fail again.

13:39.490 --> 13:44.189
After Oliver, all the girls in my school do not stop talking about you.

13:58.555 --> 14:02.850
Have you had time to send a fly that pathetic little girlfriend of yours ...

14:05.151 --> 14:06.851
... To kiss a real woman?

14:17.152 --> 14:20.489
There you are! Listen, I found a-

14:24.790 --> 14:25.990
I have to go.

14:39.991 --> 14:42.189
Spud, I can tell you one thing about Amanda,

14:42.890 --> 14:46.099
And, uh, it's definitely intense.

14:46.600 --> 14:51.888
Greetings, ladies and gentlemen in the hot dog eating competition.

14:51.889 --> 14:55.333
- ¡Mírenlos eat! - ¡Vamos, greasy, come on!

14:56.134 --> 15:01.200
23 hot dogs each, this is amazing, ladies and gentlemen!

15:01.901 --> 15:04.494
Mrs. David and Mr. Kruger can no longer ...

15:04.495 --> 15:07.189
... And it is outside the competence ladies and gentlemen.

15:07.590 --> 15:09.823
Before going to go through your consolation prize, right?

15:13.224 --> 15:15.499
Look at that. This is getting intense.

15:15.700 --> 15:18.322
Look at that, ladies and gentlemen, there was never ...

15:18.323 --> 15:20.999
... Seen it eat two hot dogs at once!

15:22.100 --> 15:25.899
Do not try that at home, ladies and gentlemen! Do not try this at home!

15:26.100 --> 15:29.800
Now it remains to see who continues to the end and who resigned.

15:31.401 --> 15:34.444
See if your opponent holds more and is ready for the challenge.

15:34.445 --> 15:37.777
- Vamos, vamos.
- Come, come.

15:38.178 --> 15:41.044
If you are doing it, yes! This is incredible!

15:41.045 --> 15:43.899
What a great fight of these young people!

15:43.900 --> 15:47.788
What a great test of endurance! Your parents must be so proud!

15:49.189 --> 15:53.489
Look at that! That is an incredible maneuver the competitor!

15:54.690 --> 15:57.489
But it is looking a little ... a little sick.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.333
Do not worry son, you'll be fine.

15:59.434 --> 16:01.344
Do not worry ladies and gentlemen, I have seen this before.

16:03.345 --> 16:06.333
No, no! And if vomiting, ladies and gentlemen!

16:06.634 --> 16:08.964
That automatically removed from the competition,

16:08.965 --> 16:11.489
and it means that the contest winner is ...!

16:12.090 --> 16:14.989
The big winner is the "greasy" Sidney Smitherson-Scott!

16:15.590 --> 16:18.888
It is incredible! Greasy, greasy, how do you feel ?!

16:19.089 --> 16:21.600
- It felt like a tasty snack. - Yes!

16:21.601 --> 16:24.666
Brome, jokes, if it ate a lot!

16:45.000 --> 16:49.200
Cherry, put that damn incompetent Wilson to phone

16:49.301 --> 16:51.200
We go to the festival of Midland guys.

16:52.901 --> 16:55.111
When we win that we will be legends.

16:57.412 --> 17:00.000
I want to see you all in my office to already.

17:09.201 --> 17:15.566
Last year their clandestine activities were leaked ...

17:16.067 --> 17:22.222
- ... The lake to swim in which two boys almost drowning.

17:24.423 --> 17:28.999
Putting me and this school in a very serious position.

17:33.500 --> 17:40.444
Now the meeting falsifying weekend passes.

17:40.445 --> 17:42.489
- Lord, Mr. Wilson did not give it. - Given a mierd-!

17:42.490 --> 17:45.455
Take care of that language, Mr. Wilson!

17:46.656 --> 17:47.656
Thank you.

17:49.857 --> 17:53.485
Boys have to look after the reputation of the school ...

17:53.486 --> 17:56.923
... And if you do not, I swear I will.

18:00.124 --> 18:03.788
Therefore, this is my last warning to all of you.

18:03.989 --> 18:09.600
A transgression of this nature more and result in expulsion.

18:12.201 --> 18:14.294
All are confined indoors until further notice ...

18:14.295 --> 18:16.222
... And they are forbidden to go to the festival of Midland.

18:18.423 --> 18:19.423
Have a nice day.

18:25.824 --> 18:30.181
So far my punishment have been merciful,

18:30.182 --> 18:33.770
I'll make them wish never born.

18:51.071 --> 18:52.071
Sit.

19:00.272 --> 19:01.472
Ribs.

19:03.673 --> 19:05.073
So it's what they call me?

19:07.274 --> 19:09.666
I understand that yours is Spud, because you ...

19:18.467 --> 19:22.344
Listen, Milton, you have to wake up.

19:23.345 --> 19:27.249
School, this is your chance.

19:28.150 --> 19:30.099
If you mess this, you can end up like your father.

19:30.800 --> 19:34.671
Now, the way I see it, Milton is that time is running out you ...

19:34.672 --> 19:38.303
... Before your friend Black, do you do something incredibly stupid.

19:39.404 --> 19:45.555
But if you and I work together, perhaps your future is safe.

19:46.356 --> 19:49.099
Well. Could you think about that Milton?

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Yes sir.

19:53.101 --> 19:54.501
Retírate.

19:59.902 --> 20:03.666
I do not know what you're thinking, but it is very obvious what's happening.

20:04.767 --> 20:07.400
Costilla will stop at nothing to make us expel all.

20:07.401 --> 20:09.400
- You are absolutely right. - We must stay together.

20:09.401 --> 20:11.999
Which only leaves us with one option.

20:13.900 --> 20:16.155
Costilla catch before he caught us.

20:16.156 --> 20:17.356
- Yes. - Yes.

20:17.857 --> 20:19.157
What do you mean?

20:19.158 --> 20:21.333
I want to give everything to get fired.

20:23.634 --> 20:24.634
What?

20:25.235 --> 20:26.899
He dresses as was watching the Glock.

20:27.300 --> 20:30.426
Right? All we have to do is prove that ...

20:30.427 --> 20:33.500
... Costilla can not control our house and sent a farmer.

20:33.901 --> 20:36.201
If, farmer.

20:36.802 --> 20:39.666
I do not see how we can do that without expel us.

20:40.967 --> 20:42.788
Do not worry about it, Spud.

20:43.889 --> 20:45.489
First we pass unnoticed.

20:54.222 --> 20:57.099
And after the holidays attack.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.111
And our game begins.

20:59.712 --> 21:00.991
So it was decided to declare ...

21:00.992 --> 21:02.444
... Our war on our supervising teacher.

21:02.845 --> 21:06.444
And as always Spud Milton was trapped in the middle.

21:08.745 --> 21:10.045
Easter holidays.

21:10.046 --> 21:13.289
If expelled me, here it is where come.

21:13.290 --> 21:15.000
A Dad's old school.

21:16.401 --> 21:17.955
They not even give theater classes.

21:20.656 --> 21:24.144
In January, I learned from a newspaper that won Miss Teen Sirena Durban.

21:25.145 --> 21:28.111
- When I called to congratulate her ... - Sorry, Johnny.

21:29.612 --> 21:32.033
- There's another man. - She Finished with me.

21:36.534 --> 21:38.500
Hey, you're done with this?

21:40.501 --> 21:41.501
Hey!

22:12.899 --> 22:14.999
- I was looking for and was not. - I left it in the car.

22:17.601 --> 22:20.589
What to emigrate turned serious after being stolen car.

22:20.990 --> 22:23.492
Shit! They stole the car!

22:23.593 --> 22:25.809
I've had enough of this damn country!

22:28.810 --> 22:31.204
Innocence actually borrowed it.

22:32.405 --> 22:33.405
Mrs.

22:33.406 --> 22:35.500
For mom was pretty much the same thing.

22:35.901 --> 22:37.444
- Say something. - You say something.

22:37.445 --> 22:39.400
- You say something! - What do you want me to say?

22:39.401 --> 22:42.318
To compensate for past injustices began to share ...

22:42.319 --> 22:45.144
... More with Dad what he earned with his illegal liquor business.

22:54.845 --> 22:57.344
Dad began selling life insurance.

22:57.945 --> 23:01.666
Even if you die, I will give.

23:02.067 --> 23:04.899
So far it has sold only three.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Uno a "Wombat. "

23:06.001 --> 23:07.222
Listen. Do not do that.

23:07.323 --> 23:09.461
After reading the first status report ...

23:09.462 --> 23:11.689
... Costilla, mother railed furiously against me.

23:11.690 --> 23:14.677
Just what you throw away! All elections you did!

23:14.678 --> 23:16.899
I have not told you to go!

23:24.500 --> 23:25.500
Maybe he's right.

23:26.801 --> 23:29.900
If I am expelled from school, I will never return me a famous actor.

23:30.301 --> 23:32.111
Ni recuperaré a Sirena.

23:36.712 --> 23:37.912
Are you all right, son?

23:42.713 --> 23:44.899
You know, the Rugby is a dangerous game.

23:46.400 --> 23:48.400
I think the basic life insurance covers.

23:49.701 --> 23:50.701
Dad, I don't-

23:54.702 --> 23:56.099
Is that a maybe?

23:58.300 --> 23:59.300
It is a maybe.

24:01.100 --> 24:02.100
SECOND QUARTER.

24:02.101 --> 24:05.111
Every night at 8, Costilla was leaving his house to go for cigarettes.

24:06.412 --> 24:09.288
It was also the time when Eve liked to bathe.

24:11.189 --> 24:13.555
How to fit this into our master plan, he was not sure.

24:13.956 --> 24:16.299
But you could not say no to Rambo who had us ...

24:16.300 --> 24:18.888
... I convinced that even had sex with Eve when he felt like it.

24:25.689 --> 24:27.400
Spud, Rain Man, go to watch if he returns.

24:27.801 --> 24:28.801
Guys.

24:44.602 --> 24:47.244
This is crazy.

24:50.745 --> 24:53.111
- Is it over there? - Do not move so much!

24:54.012 --> 24:56.011
- Already he entered? - Tell us when it does.

24:56.312 --> 24:57.612
Already you are recording?

25:00.313 --> 25:02.099
- What does? - Brat, will not tell us.

25:02.700 --> 25:03.700
is not that.

25:06.701 --> 25:08.101
Oh, this is fantastic!

25:14.102 --> 25:15.102
I've never seen such naked.

25:16.703 --> 25:18.553
- Here comes Rambo. - You're already naked?

25:18.754 --> 25:21.055
- What's going on? - Tell us what happened.

25:21.856 --> 25:23.888
- What? - Come on, tell us what happens.

25:26.689 --> 25:28.689
It Costilla! Let's go!

25:32.290 --> 25:34.444
Guys, it Costilla, and returned.

25:35.045 --> 25:37.222
Frayed, faster, lower it, hide it.

25:38.223 --> 25:42.689
- Get up, get up, come on! - Come on, come on, run!

25:49.190 --> 25:51.444
Get out! I told you it was over!

26:00.891 --> 26:04.000
- What? - Someone was watching me.

26:08.401 --> 26:11.999
- It's lovely. - That, that is.

26:30.401 --> 26:31.401
What a disappointment!

26:32.222 --> 26:34.402
Boys even got to the best part.

26:34.703 --> 26:37.999
- You're a dog. - Yes, I miserable.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.999
What will you do with the tape? If Costilla sees, we expel them all.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.440
¿Expel? We do not want to expel us.

26:44.441 --> 26:47.222
Do not start queer, you will not see the tape.

26:47.223 --> 26:49.999
- And what's your problem Spud? - I have none.

26:51.400 --> 26:54.204
I just thought we'd do things for them to run to Costilla.

26:54.905 --> 26:56.666
Not all of us.

27:00.967 --> 27:02.899
Do you have any bright ideas, genius?

27:08.500 --> 27:09.800
I thought so.

27:14.101 --> 27:15.101
Play it again.

27:18.802 --> 27:19.802
I go to bed.

27:43.899 --> 27:47.447
Milton My wife tells me that someone in the house was ...

27:47.448 --> 27:51.300
... Spying outside my house last night, you know something?

27:52.201 --> 27:55.189
- No sir. - I saw, sir.

27:58.890 --> 28:01.788
Want to notify the School Board Scholarship?

28:03.189 --> 28:06.188
- I Do not want any trouble, sir. - Good.

28:06.189 --> 28:08.189
Then tell me what happened.

28:15.890 --> 28:17.633
He was late for class, sir.

28:25.634 --> 28:28.999
Just read the document. It's a very generous offer!

28:29.000 --> 28:31.555
I do not behold! Out, out!

28:31.556 --> 28:33.222
¡Maldito Spud!

28:33.223 --> 28:34.899
Read your own mediocrity!

28:46.300 --> 28:47.600
He is okay?

28:48.401 --> 28:50.700
He offered me a retreat.

28:52.301 --> 28:54.566
- What are you going to do? - Fight!

28:54.567 --> 28:58.333
I fight him to the end.

28:58.734 --> 29:02.333
Now that my wife was I fight for this school or never forgive myself.

29:02.334 --> 29:04.666
- He went? - Have not you heard?

29:06.667 --> 29:07.667
You mean you're dead woman?

29:07.668 --> 29:11.444
No, she is not dead! She left me for the guild.

29:12.645 --> 29:14.955
I think he's in Yurick.

29:15.356 --> 29:16.556
Well, enough of that.

29:16.557 --> 29:21.390
Now tell me about your book, tell me about 1942.

29:22.291 --> 29:25.199
- I'm done, sir. - Do you know who is personally signed?

29:25.200 --> 29:26.200
¿Por George Orwell?

29:26.201 --> 29:28.400
Not for the woman who stole my virginity.

29:30.001 --> 29:31.899
His name was Yen?

29:32.100 --> 29:34.584
Well you have to start somewhere. Well,

29:34.585 --> 29:37.777
What do you think? Any advantage in this fascist utopia?

29:38.378 --> 29:40.800
It reminded me a lot to this place, sir.

29:41.101 --> 29:43.444
Yes, sir, what are we going to do about it?

29:43.445 --> 29:46.455
There seems to Mandela style, is it?

29:46.956 --> 29:50.600
- What should we do? - Challenge her!

29:51.101 --> 29:52.888
Challenge her to make it better!

29:54.289 --> 29:55.289
But, sir ...

29:58.390 --> 29:59.390
What?

30:02.291 --> 30:04.389
Costilla want to betray my friends.

30:04.690 --> 30:07.555
Threatens to take away my scholarship.

30:11.256 --> 30:16.011
So it is being an informer or be shattered, right?

30:18.712 --> 30:20.700
Do you still want to be a Milton actor?

30:22.701 --> 30:24.788
- More than anything in the world, sir. - Well!

30:24.789 --> 30:27.222
Well, think of all the great actors.

30:27.223 --> 30:29.666
They have always given the middle finger to authority.

30:29.667 --> 30:34.289
Richard Burton, James Dean, Brando Malon, are not a bunch of cowards, do you?

30:34.790 --> 30:39.600
And think of the biggest rebel of all, the founder of our philosophy.

30:39.601 --> 30:43.099
Socrates, you next reading.

30:43.100 --> 30:46.788
A simple citizen opposed to the powerful city-state of Athens.

30:50.289 --> 30:51.788
What happened to all of them, sir?

30:52.189 --> 30:56.400
Oh, well, accidents, poisonings, murders.

30:56.401 --> 30:58.099
They worked well the middle finger then.

30:58.100 --> 30:59.222
More than anything else.

31:37.544 --> 31:39.800
Guys, I think I have a plan to catch Costilla.

31:51.201 --> 31:54.566
Well, guys, this is what we need to do.

32:00.467 --> 32:04.023
The plan was simple, first we had to motivate the "seven normal."

32:06.124 --> 32:07.788
That was the name we had for the new.

32:07.789 --> 32:09.767
Who were in serious danger of becoming the boys ...

32:09.768 --> 32:11.677
... They are receiving more abuse in school history.

32:12.578 --> 32:15.365
The call, "Skinny," "Fencing," "Dwarf"

32:15.366 --> 32:18.333
"Darryl," "Donald, y
"Darryl negro. " o "Nerryl"

32:18.734 --> 32:21.409
Guys, this is how they want the rest of the year?

32:23.910 --> 32:27.700
Or do they want to be known as bold and hard?

32:27.701 --> 32:29.553
All you had to do was convince ...

32:29.554 --> 32:31.089
... Seven to go swimming at night.

32:32.190 --> 32:34.428
Since we did something famous and almost two idiots ...

32:34.429 --> 32:36.666
... Drown, night swimming was prohibited.

32:36.667 --> 32:40.789
In accordance with brat is a combination of sleep, smoking and sex.

32:42.790 --> 32:45.709
We plan to notify the Glock and caught the normal seven.

32:47.610 --> 32:49.800
What would be bright for his reputation.

32:50.401 --> 32:52.121
But best of all would look like ...

32:52.122 --> 32:54.000
... That Costilla can not watch the new.

32:54.001 --> 32:55.001
Wilson.

32:55.002 --> 32:57.577
And most great ...

32:57.878 --> 33:00.000
- It's a tradition. - We'd be invisible.

33:00.001 --> 33:02.166
- It's cold. - You can leave the chapel.

33:02.167 --> 33:04.777
- What chapel window? - We will show.

33:41.566 --> 33:44.089
Hello, champions, how are you doing?

33:44.790 --> 33:47.500
How you doing son? Oh, what a pity you're such a wimp.

33:59.701 --> 34:02.700
- How did you know? - The prefects should be spying.

34:02.701 --> 34:04.900
We can not against rib and prefects.

34:04.901 --> 34:08.699
If we can, we just have to be more careful.

34:09.900 --> 34:10.900
Crazy Dog.

34:11.502 --> 34:15.400
- Are you ready? - Yes, ready to use.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.089
- What is ready? - What are you talking about?

34:17.090 --> 34:20.244
This will bring us into the deepest shit that we've been.

34:21.545 --> 34:24.244
We will turn this place into our realm.

34:24.945 --> 34:27.777
Meet me after the chapel after sports.

34:28.578 --> 34:29.978
And look natural.

34:45.279 --> 34:46.579
Come on guys, walking.

35:18.999 --> 35:20.111
Where is Mad Dog?

35:20.712 --> 35:23.233
Como taste trépense, or climb to the rubbed váyanse.

35:28.334 --> 35:30.234
Rise, rise.

35:53.335 --> 35:54.599
It can not be!

36:00.800 --> 36:03.044
Welcome to the house of madness, guys.

36:03.045 --> 36:06.111
- Yes! - Where did you get all this?

36:06.112 --> 36:10.111
We use our own money and stole the rest of the warehouse maintenance.

36:10.112 --> 36:12.333
This truck is Costilla.

36:12.934 --> 36:14.334
What classic!

36:14.335 --> 36:17.344
And the lamp too.

36:18.845 --> 36:21.144
- First. - Oh, yes!

36:21.445 --> 36:23.509
A drink as vow of silence.

36:31.610 --> 36:33.700
I think we never saw so excited.

36:34.701 --> 36:38.444
While we were still in school grounds, it felt like on another planet.

36:38.445 --> 36:41.999
Miles away from ordinary mortals.

36:46.500 --> 36:50.789
Guys, if we're going to rib and prefects,

36:51.190 --> 36:54.209
It has to be to the end.

36:55.310 --> 36:59.400
So from now on is a fight to the death.

36:59.401 --> 37:01.101
Come on, júntenlas.

37:04.702 --> 37:05.702
On three!

37:23.389 --> 37:26.877
If you did not know better I would say that smell like ass rat.

37:32.478 --> 37:37.222
Well, I think this is the right time for some poetry.

37:38.123 --> 37:43.800
No, I do not speak of the poetry of drunken souls, I mean the EEC

37:47.201 --> 37:48.901
Does the European Economic Community?

37:48.902 --> 37:54.881
No, no, poetry openly, with contempt the name EE ...

37:54.882 --> 38:01.034
... Capitalism and deliberately used incorrect punctuation.

38:01.035 --> 38:04.222
Lord, what kind of poetry that has no sex included?

38:04.223 --> 38:08.709
Indeed, it is, and most importantly, I had sex because of it.

38:09.110 --> 38:13.627
So followers of dosing read something ...

38:13.628 --> 38:18.144
Poetry in the least acceptable place on earth ...

38:19.245 --> 38:20.445
Bring a book.

38:29.246 --> 38:33.999
Try to page 63, my country is right here.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.666
ONE FOR THE TEAM OWNER.

38:42.500 --> 38:46.586
At Greenstein, you will be playing the role of ...

38:46.587 --> 38:50.999
... So flirtatious nymph will read every line.

38:51.000 --> 38:55.444
Milton, you will do the role of Hersey Dusa.

38:55.445 --> 39:00.999
So you will read an equal number of lines. Start.

39:02.500 --> 39:03.518
Can I feel it?

39:03.519 --> 39:06.189
I understand this if to hug me, right?

39:06.190 --> 39:09.600
- Just once? - What fun?

39:09.601 --> 39:10.601
It's comfortable here.

39:10.602 --> 39:12.602
Do not put both hands.

39:12.603 --> 39:16.111
- What is not so? - Where are you.

39:16.712 --> 39:20.399
- Thanks. - This is an outrage!

39:20.400 --> 39:23.595
Rugby This field is off limits to all ...

39:23.596 --> 39:26.999
... Those who are not members and only they, out, out!

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
Out!

39:28.601 --> 39:29.601
Out!

39:30.702 --> 39:33.832
I do not know what your game Edly, but I assure you ...

39:33.833 --> 39:37.202
... You will not make a mockery of our sacred traditions.

39:37.203 --> 39:40.999
They were good just standing on the lawn, director, not burning the flag.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.222
Exactly the source of arson.

39:44.901 --> 39:47.111
Is this about your early retirement?

39:47.112 --> 39:51.666
The only one in danger of an early withdrawal is this school.

39:55.367 --> 39:59.888
Do not push Edly, I have the board in my pocket on this.

40:03.589 --> 40:07.111
It is the cambo Ruby, not the field of poetry.

40:08.412 --> 40:10.500
- Good. - Understood.

40:11.101 --> 40:14.333
Your kind of Shakespeare are the first to step on without authorization.

40:14.834 --> 40:16.234
Well that I do not know.

40:18.535 --> 40:20.444
The rebellion was everywhere.

40:20.445 --> 40:23.318
With the Madhouse as our headquarters, we started ...

40:23.319 --> 40:26.400
... Our war plan rib and prefects.

40:27.001 --> 40:29.627
Also, "The Boss" deserted the order marking all ...

40:29.628 --> 40:32.155
... Boring doors teachers with red x.

40:33.056 --> 40:37.111
Marking what he called "the lazy current place of teaching."

40:56.777 --> 40:59.222
Do not look at me! Why if something smells bad they look at me?

42:02.000 --> 42:04.699
Parking Problems, Mr. Wilson?

42:05.200 --> 42:06.800
Only one niggle, director.

42:15.901 --> 42:17.201
Get it out now!

42:28.102 --> 42:31.111
It did not take long for the prefects to take revenge.

42:31.112 --> 42:33.555
- On your knees anymore. - Good Guy.

42:34.056 --> 42:36.666
Are you ready? Everybody ready? Alright guys.

42:36.667 --> 42:38.167
Pass.

42:54.868 --> 42:56.843
And Costilla forced everyone to add to ...

42:56.844 --> 42:58.700
... The work of the house known as "the ark."

42:59.301 --> 43:01.999
Directed by "mortal Breath" and Hamilton.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.888
- More action. - Yes, yes, more passion.

43:14.989 --> 43:15.989
What a clown!

43:16.990 --> 43:17.990
That's it!

43:21.191 --> 43:23.788
But it did not look good for my acting career.

43:24.489 --> 43:27.000
Flapping arms.

43:31.101 --> 43:34.700
But while we had our asylum, nothing could be depressed.

43:35.201 --> 43:38.709
Also devised a murderer Rambo plan to win this war.

43:38.710 --> 43:41.444
Guys, we're ready to finish this.

43:42.045 --> 43:44.888
As the party approached the house and Costilla was in charge.

43:44.889 --> 43:48.144
We were going to sure it was a complete disaster.

43:50.245 --> 43:52.988
Milton, turn off the lights.

43:53.489 --> 43:54.489
Yes sir.

44:08.490 --> 44:12.777
I do not know if you have plans, but do you want to come to the party of the House in the afternoon?

44:16.678 --> 44:19.000
- It's okay. - Seriously.

44:31.801 --> 44:33.999
It's time, a night of conquests.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.888
Costilla and recover end up with my girlfriend.

44:38.089 --> 44:40.089
Idiots, ready for a challenge?

44:40.190 --> 44:41.190
That never.

44:41.191 --> 44:44.333
If we take the girl to one of your guys you give us $ 100.

44:45.534 --> 44:49.444
But if we do the same with one of your own, you will do the same.

44:49.445 --> 44:51.444
As if that were to happen.

44:52.045 --> 44:53.045
Done.

44:55.346 --> 44:56.346
¿Sirena va a venir?

44:58.347 --> 45:03.023
Just drop your pants and demand oral sex.

45:03.024 --> 45:04.824
That's what I do.

46:06.666 --> 46:07.777
¡Wilson!

46:10.778 --> 46:14.555
Mr. Wilson, what in God's name is going on?

46:14.956 --> 46:17.122
Nothing unusual, Mr. Director.

46:17.123 --> 46:19.333
I hope so, I hope so.

46:19.334 --> 46:22.178
Ladies please enjoy the meeting.

46:26.979 --> 46:29.444
The howls went better than expected.

46:30.645 --> 46:34.344
The next phase involved the seven normal and girls.

46:48.545 --> 46:51.444
We are in trouble. "Mortal Breath" is the DJ ...

46:51.445 --> 46:54.289
... And everyone knows that the DJ always check twice.

46:54.890 --> 46:57.099
Have you seen his girlfriend?

47:02.100 --> 47:05.555
Now all I had to do was follow the advice of Brat with Sirena.

47:18.256 --> 47:20.333
Johnny're my best friend.

47:23.634 --> 47:25.400
I have a boyfriend now.

47:28.101 --> 47:29.501
Why are you holding my hand?

47:32.102 --> 47:33.102
Johnny...

47:36.103 --> 47:37.103
And you the ...

47:46.804 --> 47:48.204
I should go.

48:00.855 --> 48:01.600
Do it.

48:04.501 --> 48:08.999
Guys, there are two very good girls showering naked in bathrooms.

48:09.600 --> 48:11.444
Come on guys, let's see.

48:22.145 --> 48:23.333
And Spud ...

48:24.434 --> 48:25.888
Where's your girl?

48:26.789 --> 48:27.989
I had to leave.

48:30.290 --> 48:31.290
Shall We Dance?

48:47.189 --> 48:48.222
Where did they go?

48:48.223 --> 48:50.022
They said they were in the shower, disappeared? Where did they go?

48:53.423 --> 48:56.600
Take off all your clothes! Ya!

49:14.801 --> 49:18.044
Thanks guys, that is worth $ 200.

49:26.900 --> 49:28.099
What is missing?

49:33.200 --> 49:37.389
Hello. Thanks for coming. The meeting is officially completed.

49:46.090 --> 49:47.788
Tell Mad Dog to prepare.

49:49.789 --> 49:54.199
Mad dog, come on. What do you do, we said nothing to paint?

49:54.500 --> 49:55.500
Now they are.

50:10.101 --> 50:11.201
Now now.

50:17.602 --> 50:18.902
¡Háganlo!

50:20.203 --> 50:22.266
CRAZY DOG.

50:22.767 --> 50:23.767
Crazy Dog.

50:26.668 --> 50:29.444
Time to show what they are made, guys. Now!

50:46.045 --> 50:48.700
This school is a disgrace!

50:49.901 --> 50:51.301
¡Wilson!

50:53.602 --> 50:55.666
Sign up now. Move!

51:00.367 --> 51:03.266
So I finish the craziest party in school history.

51:03.967 --> 51:05.788
Standard Seven were only six.

51:05.789 --> 51:08.400
But they won much credit.

51:10.101 --> 51:13.888
Mad Dog was delighted with the outcome of their work.

51:14.389 --> 51:16.999
And of course Costilla blamed us all.

51:17.600 --> 51:18.989
But we told him we had to try it.

51:19.290 --> 51:21.190
And our supervising teacher suspended.

51:28.091 --> 51:30.466
Eight crazy were not the only ones enjoying their revolution.

51:31.066 --> 51:32.066
FESTIVITIES.

51:32.067 --> 51:33.689
Innocence had taken control.

51:34.290 --> 51:38.400
Her business is thriving and now have a better car than ours.

51:39.201 --> 51:41.700
They thought I had stolen his car.

51:42.301 --> 51:44.147
With the New South Africa literally on the doorstep ...

51:44.148 --> 51:45.788
... Of our house, my mother reached its limit.

51:45.789 --> 51:50.500
It's over, I'll put the house on sale! We moved to England!

51:51.601 --> 51:55.444
I will commit suicide if I have to eat their food and drink your drink!

51:55.945 --> 52:00.199
The truth is that despite everything, Dad is more patriotic than anyone I know.

52:21.200 --> 52:22.200
Returned!

52:23.701 --> 52:24.701
¡Vamos!

52:25.202 --> 52:27.300
Of course, I did not want to leave.

52:27.601 --> 52:29.277
So Dad and I spent the rest of the ...

52:29.278 --> 52:31.289
... Festivities scaring potential buyers.

52:35.090 --> 52:36.090
How's it going?

52:38.591 --> 52:41.444
Sorry, we were going to swim but the pool is infested.

52:41.445 --> 52:44.045
Mosquitoes murderers, but pass.

52:44.646 --> 52:49.262
This house used to be a transvestite brothel.

52:52.663 --> 52:53.963
What are you doing ?!

52:55.064 --> 52:58.999
Listen, we are living with the enemy at home.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.899
Mom just want to stay here and keep going to school myself.

53:01.900 --> 53:03.788
Then you will only see us once a year.

53:04.589 --> 53:07.400
- More time without you sounds better. - John Milton!

53:10.301 --> 53:12.478
That child, I tell you.

53:12.779 --> 53:15.044
It will not eat with the maid, do you?

54:19.799 --> 54:21.244
Johnny, what are you doing?

54:27.145 --> 54:28.545
I love you so much.

54:34.646 --> 54:35.899
Who is this little idiot?

54:42.666 --> 54:43.845
AMANDA LIST talking points:

54:43.846 --> 54:44.484
1. HOW ARE YOU?

54:44.485 --> 54:46.444
2. THANKS FOR THE SATURDAY NIGHT

54:46.445 --> 54:47.888
3. How's school? - Hello?

54:47.889 --> 54:51.666
4. WHEN we meet again? - Hi, I'm John.

54:53.767 --> 54:55.266
Do not ever call this number again.

55:02.567 --> 55:03.888
Note for yourself.

55:03.889 --> 55:08.727
To avoid madness, rejection and despair ...

55:08.728 --> 55:13.666
.evita girls and never, ever drink again.

55:16.667 --> 55:19.200
THIRD QUARTER. - Season nonsense.

55:19.201 --> 55:21.777
Bottoms up, bottoms up!

55:21.778 --> 55:23.520
And to drown my sorrows eight crazy ...

55:23.521 --> 55:25.111
... They had to be insanely bright.

55:26.612 --> 55:31.300
Vern scored a sword and psycho score for the unbeaten East.

55:33.801 --> 55:37.600
The only problem is that sometimes forgets Bonding with balo the goal.

55:50.101 --> 55:53.555
In the holidays, Mad Dog killed a deer with his hunting knife.

55:55.656 --> 55:56.788
He points out the differences.

55:57.589 --> 56:00.176
"Greasy" swear that suddenly became the ...

56:00.177 --> 56:02.999
...agua normal en soda
usando solo gas natural.

56:04.200 --> 56:06.233
But no one was brave enough to take a sip.

56:08.334 --> 56:10.461
Brat got a book in the library that ...

56:10.462 --> 56:12.899
... I had a list of 10 sensitive points of women.

56:14.600 --> 56:16.666
But someone had already stolen the page.

56:18.667 --> 56:21.000
Chief organized a revolt against the remodeling of the chapel.

56:21.001 --> 56:23.899
Who said he was willing and inconsiderate.

56:30.400 --> 56:32.389
Simon left the Rugby for tennis.

56:32.390 --> 56:33.999
And it's the starting lineup.

56:34.100 --> 56:37.089
Now all they called Gabriel Salvatinni.

56:41.890 --> 56:45.244
As my hair on the balls are already midnight.

56:46.145 --> 56:48.333
But I worry that having breast cancer.

56:51.509 --> 56:53.788
Rambo challenge to the prefects to struggle with the rope.

56:53.789 --> 56:54.888
What are you doing?

56:54.889 --> 56:59.666
Avoid pulling and just wait for the prefects to tire themselves.

57:57.500 --> 58:00.788
You do not have breast cancer, is well placed to become aroused.

58:01.289 --> 58:04.488
Uhhh, her nipples get hard because success.

58:15.189 --> 58:16.986
Why did you think you had breast cancer?

58:16.987 --> 58:18.222
I had never set hard.

58:18.623 --> 58:21.199
- ¡Drones! - Cállense, esperen.

58:22.500 --> 58:25.189
- Did you hear something? - We know you're up there.

58:34.590 --> 58:37.466
Come on, pieces of shit down!

58:41.067 --> 58:43.489
Nobody move, okay?

58:43.490 --> 58:45.089
There is no way to rise.

58:59.155 --> 59:01.700
Or down or I'll call the police!

59:24.900 --> 59:27.700
I am very curious to know what's up there.

59:37.501 --> 59:39.201
Costilla made us wait all day.

59:39.902 --> 59:43.333
As expected, discussions about who betrayed us is formed,

59:47.334 --> 59:49.700
I wanted to die when I found my diary.

59:56.201 --> 59:59.700
- Where did you get this? - The car of my father.

01:00:00.801 --> 01:00:04.389
- And the rest? - We picked up trash.

01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:18.700
We find when we went to the farm and we wanted to keep it there.

01:00:18.701 --> 01:00:20.101
Really?

01:00:22.102 --> 01:00:25.677
Well, let's see ...

01:00:27.278 --> 01:00:29.900
Let Spud has to say about it.

01:00:36.701 --> 01:00:41.777
- Lord, everything in that journal are lies. - Is that Milton?

01:00:43.978 --> 01:00:44.978
¿Milton?

01:00:48.279 --> 01:00:51.999
- Yes sir. - Well then.

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:55.599
Out. Get out!

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.222
Milton, tú te quedas.

01:01:05.823 --> 01:01:11.555
You and your crew will be expelled from school if you do not confess all to the principal.

01:01:11.556 --> 01:01:16.335
Now all you have to do is admit that what you wrote here ...

01:01:16.336 --> 01:01:21.239
... And maybe it's true, you can save your miserable little future.

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.600
This is private property, sir.

01:01:33.601 --> 01:01:36.478
I have a copy boy.

01:01:37.579 --> 01:01:38.579
¡Lárgate!

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:03.333
- What did you say to him? - Nothing.

01:02:03.334 --> 01:02:04.334
And fuck!

01:02:04.635 --> 01:02:08.244
I promise, I asked him to return me my diary.

01:02:08.445 --> 01:02:12.299
You think you're better than us, do not you, Spud?

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.444
Write to the smallest detail in the newspaper.

01:02:19.845 --> 01:02:21.045
That sucks!

01:02:21.046 --> 01:02:23.289
And we played it!

01:02:25.946 --> 01:02:27.744
So thanks for making us expelled.

01:02:55.755 --> 01:02:57.222
What's going on?

01:02:58.523 --> 01:03:00.444
Have not you heard? I have been asked to resign.

01:03:00.845 --> 01:03:02.545
So that's what I'll do.

01:03:02.646 --> 01:03:04.111
But, sir, do not say we fight?

01:03:04.112 --> 01:03:07.579
I've spent half of my life struggling with this house ...

01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:11.444
... Crazy and do not know why I bother, the whole place is a mess.

01:03:11.645 --> 01:03:15.555
Lord, please, just stay until the end of the year.

01:03:15.856 --> 01:03:18.144
I'm not sure you're here for the end of the year.

01:03:19.545 --> 01:03:21.289
- He knows? - Do You Know?

01:03:21.290 --> 01:03:25.167
Fools like you have been doing the same ever since.

01:03:25.168 --> 01:03:29.044
Bicks and Frank Samuel were living anywhere.

01:03:31.345 --> 01:03:32.745
I do not know what to do.

01:03:34.146 --> 01:03:36.400
If I do not accept that everything I wrote in my journal it is true,

01:03:38.601 --> 01:03:40.049
We are going to drive, sir.

01:03:43.350 --> 01:03:44.550
Look, fool ...

01:03:47.251 --> 01:03:48.888
Do not listen to this old fool, right?

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.452
Just do what they ask.

01:03:50.853 --> 01:03:54.289
You will have the opportunity to have a life.

01:03:56.890 --> 01:04:01.500
If you do not seize this opportunity, you always regret.

01:04:16.701 --> 01:04:19.370
Alright, I'll stay until the end of ...

01:04:19.371 --> 01:04:22.222
... Year but you'd better help me unpack.

01:04:26.123 --> 01:04:27.523
One thing was certain.

01:04:31.024 --> 01:04:33.489
Eight Crazy would not be the same again.

01:05:12.790 --> 01:05:14.566
Good morning, idiots.

01:05:15.167 --> 01:05:17.555
The Glock wants to see you in his office.

01:05:17.856 --> 01:05:18.856
Now.

01:05:42.888 --> 01:05:44.999
Here come the eight crazy.

01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:43.666
Knights, for their reckless behavior and ...

01:06:43.667 --> 01:06:47.465
... The complete indifference to the rules of ...

But nonconformists.

01:20:44.556 --> 01:20:45.556
Excuse me?

01:20:45.557 --> 01:20:49.368
Dear Editor, if you think the best way to care for the reputation of this ...

01:20:53.445 --> 01:20:54.545
Are you done?

01:20:54.546 --> 01:20:57.933
The question to ask is, why?

01:20:57.934 --> 01:21:01.863
Why, why? Why these guys defy the rules?

01:21:01.864 --> 01:21:05.222
Why they are given breaks and create food fights?

01:21:05.723 --> 01:21:08.800
I'll tell because the director.

01:21:08.801 --> 01:21:13.232

01:21:18.281 --> 01:21:23.244

01:21:24.045 --> 01:21:27.816
It has been carrying out a personal vendetta ...

01:21:27.817 --> 01:21:31.144
... I have proof against these guys and me.

01:21:49.555 --> 01:21:51.999
- Is yours ...? - I think so.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.402
So Amour because one guy and his wife has made ...

01:21:57.403 --> 01:22:03.189
... His personal mission to trap and expel the boy and all his friends.

01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:04.690
Shut up!

01:22:08.391 --> 01:22:12.899
I mean, if we both have copies, director, who else has?

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.000
I mean ...

01:22:17.001 --> 01:22:18.301
If the press ...

01:22:40.788 --> 01:22:45.011
It is the future of this school in his hands, director. I trusted these guys.

01:22:46.912 --> 01:22:49.700
I must say that make you feel proud.

01:23:07.401 --> 01:23:08.401
What ...?

01:23:11.902 --> 01:23:17.678
No more talk about what they have done if I ...

01:23:17.679 --> 01:23:23.700
... They swear they will not say a word about this.

01:23:35.801 --> 01:23:39.202
Retírense.
Tú no, Wilson.

01:23:40.603 --> 01:23:47.099
And director, let me think about early retirement.

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:03.666
Well done, guys. Well done. Very well done.

01:24:16.467 --> 01:24:18.628
The Glock Costilla shouted at like 20 minutes ...

01:24:18.629 --> 01:24:20.788
... Before I dismiss as Master supervisor.

01:24:21.389 --> 01:24:23.899
Felt not be in place for a change.

01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:31.700
Rambo is back.

01:24:34.783 --> 01:24:36.777
He ended up getting the same treatment as us.

01:24:38.378 --> 01:24:40.911
Mad Dog said he was having so much fun killing animals ...

01:24:40.912 --> 01:24:43.444
... Wild on the farm of his father to return to school.

01:24:45.745 --> 01:24:48.000
DAY OF SEPARATION.

01:24:48.001 --> 01:24:50.836
The sky is unusually blue and clear today and there is a ...

01:24:50.837 --> 01:24:54.111
... Strange feeling of calm in every room he entered.

01:25:01.712 --> 01:25:05.000
In the final assembly, there was celebration instead of mourning.

01:25:05.601 --> 01:25:08.401
The Glock took a record number of ties, badges and awards.

01:25:08.902 --> 01:25:11.688
In fact who did not receive something felt like a complete loser.

01:25:13.689 --> 01:25:20.600
John Milton, English and prize good job overall.

01:25:25.601 --> 01:25:27.001
Only I was not there.
