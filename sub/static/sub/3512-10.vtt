00:50.215 --> 00:52.583
Castle, I thought this was gonna be

00:52.617 --> 00:54.751
a small gathering. I mean...

00:54.786 --> 00:57.354
there's enough food in here
for, like, 50 people.

00:57.389 --> 01:00.658
Never underestimate
the importance of leftovers...

01:00.692 --> 01:02.826
second-day stuffing, turkey soup,

01:02.860 --> 01:04.662
microwave yams,
and a visit to the food bank.

01:05.696 --> 01:08.665
And so that you know, Alexis always
makes dessert.

01:08.699 --> 01:10.099
Pi said he would make

01:10.134 --> 01:11.635
a cranberry concoction of some kind.

01:11.669 --> 01:13.937
Even mother cooks something.

01:13.971 --> 01:16.139
- It's not always edible.
-  - I heard that!

01:16.173 --> 01:18.174
Well, you know what? I make a...

01:18.208 --> 01:20.109
<i>killer</i> stuffing, and my dad makes

01:20.144 --> 01:21.611
a great traditional corn casserole.

01:21.646 --> 01:24.880
Nice. And I know
the perfect costume for you,

01:24.915 --> 01:26.215
so you don't have to worry.

01:26.250 --> 01:27.683
A costume?

01:27.717 --> 01:29.397
Yeah, I'm gonna be, uh,
settler John Rolfe,

01:29.420 --> 01:32.688
so you will, obviously,
be Pocahontas... his bride.

01:32.722 --> 01:33.956
Alexis goes back and forth.

01:33.990 --> 01:36.426
Sometimes she's puritan.
Sometimes she's native American.

01:36.460 --> 01:37.726
Just depends on where
she is in her life.

01:37.761 --> 01:39.795
Your dad can be whichever.
Nothing elaborate.

01:39.829 --> 01:41.697
Uh, so you guys... you guys dress up

01:41.731 --> 01:42.898
for Thanksgiving?

01:42.933 --> 01:44.567
Doesn't everybody?

01:44.601 --> 01:46.401
No, I think that's
pretty special to you.

01:46.436 --> 01:48.336
Um... so is there anything else
I should know about you

01:48.371 --> 01:49.471
before we get married?

01:49.505 --> 01:52.174
So many, many things.

01:54.711 --> 01:57.212
- There's been a murder in a church downtown.
- Oh.

01:57.246 --> 01:58.646
Too bad it wasn't in a cathedral.

01:58.681 --> 02:00.048
That would be so T.S. Eliot.

02:00.083 --> 02:01.849
Huh?

02:01.884 --> 02:04.252
"Murder In The Cathedral"?
Thomas Becket,

02:04.287 --> 02:06.221
- Beckett and Becket?
- Come on.

02:06.255 --> 02:07.415
- Nothing?
 - Let's go.

02:07.423 --> 02:09.223
- Anyone?
- Thank you.

02:10.860 --> 02:12.493
You know, when we do this,

02:12.527 --> 02:14.828
let's not do the dead body
in the middle of the aisle.

02:14.863 --> 02:16.764
Okay. Good call.

02:16.798 --> 02:18.165
So what happened?

02:18.200 --> 02:21.769
Well, our victim entered
the church during 6:30 mass

02:21.803 --> 02:23.237
with multiple gunshot wounds,

02:23.272 --> 02:24.671
made his way towards the altar

02:24.706 --> 02:26.807
before collapsing.

02:26.841 --> 02:28.475
But not before handing the priest

02:28.510 --> 02:29.877
- a little somethin' somethin'.
- Mm.

02:31.078 --> 02:33.814
A baby?!

02:33.848 --> 02:35.148
A boy.

02:35.182 --> 02:36.817
I'm guessing he's about 3 months.

02:36.851 --> 02:40.654
And he's hungry, 'cause he keeps
going after the girls.

02:40.688 --> 02:42.456
Well, who can blame him? Hi, buddy.

02:42.490 --> 02:44.190
What's your name, little man?

02:44.225 --> 02:47.260
<i>That</i> is a very good question.

02:48.503 --> 02:51.464
- So is this the baby's father?
- We don't really know.

02:51.498 --> 02:54.667
But what we <i>do</i> know
is his name is Cameron Ducane,

02:54.701 --> 02:55.868
30, lived in the Bronx.

02:55.903 --> 02:57.603
There's no baby pictures in his wallet.

02:57.638 --> 02:59.572
He's got a commercial driver's license...

02:59.606 --> 03:01.374
probably drives for a living.

03:01.409 --> 03:03.576
He's got a car wash coupon,

03:03.610 --> 03:07.613
and, like Ryan,
spent his hard-earned money

03:07.648 --> 03:08.681
on a lottery ticket.

03:08.715 --> 03:11.183
That is the 5 State Magicball Jackpot

03:11.217 --> 03:14.620
at $247 million. You're crazy
<i>not</i> buying a ticket.

03:14.655 --> 03:15.788
Yeah, 1 or 2, but not 50.

03:15.823 --> 03:17.189
I'm just increasing my odds of winning.

03:17.223 --> 03:18.523
Increasing your odds of being broke.

03:18.558 --> 03:20.092
Listen, do you have any idea
what it costs

03:20.126 --> 03:21.226
raising a child in New York City?

03:21.261 --> 03:22.294
I don't know how much it costs...

03:22.329 --> 03:23.429
- Guys.
- Well, of course you don't.

03:23.463 --> 03:24.896
- Guys!
- I'm not...

03:24.931 --> 03:26.432
How about we don't fight

03:26.466 --> 03:27.599
in front of the baby?

03:29.235 --> 03:32.771
Okay, contact Ducane's next of kin.

03:32.805 --> 03:35.039
Let's see if this little guy
is, indeed, his.

03:35.074 --> 03:37.576
And then what happens to him
in the meantime?

03:37.610 --> 03:38.977
Well, we'll get ahold
of child services...

03:39.011 --> 03:40.420
and they'll place him until we're able

03:40.448 --> 03:42.283
to get him back to his family.

03:42.334 --> 03:44.649
I think Lanie's right.
I think he <i>is</i> hungry.

03:44.684 --> 03:46.417
Um, how about you finish up here?

03:46.452 --> 03:47.652
I'll grab a uniform,

03:47.687 --> 03:48.753
and we'll just go pick up
some stuff for him?

03:48.788 --> 03:50.254
You really want to do that?

03:50.289 --> 03:52.957
Of course. Highly qualified.
I have an R.H.D. in child care.

03:52.992 --> 03:54.658
And an R.H.D. is...

03:54.693 --> 03:56.894
- "Ruggedly handsome dad."
- Ah.

03:56.928 --> 03:58.662
Okay. Fine. Go.

03:58.697 --> 04:00.664
Hey, buddy... let's go.

04:00.699 --> 04:03.139
Don't look at her. Come on. We'll
get ice cream.

04:04.503 --> 04:06.837
Do we know where he was shot?

04:06.872 --> 04:09.306
Uniforms found it
with the engine running

04:09.340 --> 04:10.541
and both doors wide open.

04:11.977 --> 04:14.077
Someone fired at him from above,

04:14.112 --> 04:16.213
through the roof.

04:17.348 --> 04:18.815
That's a lot of blood.

04:18.850 --> 04:20.618
Notice what's missing?

04:20.652 --> 04:22.853
There's no car seat.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.154
- Yeah.
- Whatever happened,

04:24.188 --> 04:25.522
I don't think he planned
on having a baby with him.

04:25.556 --> 04:27.524
There's no way of telling
how long he had been driving.

04:27.558 --> 04:28.925
I mean, he could have been
shot nearby...

04:28.959 --> 04:31.028
- Or miles away.
- Right.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.529
Have uniforms go through
traffic cam footage.

04:32.563 --> 04:33.930
Let's see if we can figure out

04:33.964 --> 04:36.133
- what direction this car was coming from.
- Yo.

04:36.167 --> 04:39.002
We found the victim's wife.
It's not their kid.

04:39.037 --> 04:40.937
We've only been married for two years.

04:40.971 --> 04:43.372
We weren't ready for a baby.

04:43.407 --> 04:45.107
Could the baby be a friend's
or a relative's?

04:45.142 --> 04:48.778
No, I've never seen him before.

04:48.812 --> 04:51.447
Lissa, I know this is hard,
but is it possible

04:51.481 --> 04:54.617
- that Cam had a baby outside of your
marriage? - Absolutely not.

04:54.652 --> 04:55.752
Cam told me everything.

04:55.786 --> 04:58.020
He wouldn't have kept
a secret like that.

04:58.055 --> 04:59.855
Okay. Where did he go this morning?

04:59.889 --> 05:00.889
Do you know what he was doing?

05:00.924 --> 05:03.992
He was at work. He's...

05:04.027 --> 05:05.661
he's a driver for a car service.

05:05.695 --> 05:08.664
- When did he go in?
- Around 10:00 last night.

05:08.698 --> 05:09.898
He works the overnight...

05:09.933 --> 05:12.568
11:00 to 6:00.

05:12.602 --> 05:13.902
I knew something was wrong.

05:13.937 --> 05:16.805
He just always comes home by 7:00.

05:17.907 --> 05:19.675
Uh, did you notice anything unusual

05:19.709 --> 05:21.209
in his life recently,

05:21.243 --> 05:24.947
anything that would point
to trouble of some sort?

05:24.981 --> 05:27.549
Actually, yeah.

05:27.584 --> 05:30.251
A couple of weeks ago,
he started acting...

05:30.286 --> 05:32.387
I don't know... paranoid.

05:32.421 --> 05:34.181
He bought one of those
home security systems,

05:34.190 --> 05:36.691
and he put extra locks
on all of our doors.

05:36.725 --> 05:38.693
- Did he say why?
- No, he just...

05:40.963 --> 05:42.897
oh, he said he just loved me...

05:42.931 --> 05:46.167
and that he just wanted me to be safe.

05:47.803 --> 05:50.037
This limo company... what's the name?

05:50.072 --> 05:52.974
Cameron? Jeez, he was one
of my best guys.

05:53.008 --> 05:56.110
Nice, reliable, good soul.

05:56.144 --> 05:58.178
- What happened?
- We were hoping you could tell us.

05:58.213 --> 06:00.280
We know he worked
the overnight yesterday.

06:00.315 --> 06:01.916
What time did he finish
his shift this morning?

06:01.950 --> 06:03.750
He didn't. He was on the books
to work last night,

06:03.784 --> 06:06.253
- but he didn't show up.
- He do that a lot?

06:06.287 --> 06:09.289
Nah, a year and a half here.
That was his first time.

06:09.324 --> 06:10.924
You notice anything going on
with him at work...

06:10.958 --> 06:12.826
anything unusual?

06:12.860 --> 06:14.794
Yeah, yeah, there was that guy
that showed up last week.

06:14.829 --> 06:16.604
Watch yourselves.
Guys, bring it out.

06:16.635 --> 06:17.797
What guy?

06:17.832 --> 06:20.133
Well, Cam said he was
an old friend, right?

06:20.167 --> 06:21.728
But they didn't look too friendly to me.

06:21.736 --> 06:23.803
When Cam saw him, he went pale.

06:23.838 --> 06:25.538
So he stepped outside to talk.

06:25.572 --> 06:27.240
And it sounded pretty heated.

06:27.274 --> 06:28.441
You know what it was about?

06:28.475 --> 06:29.509
No, but I heard the guy say something

06:29.543 --> 06:30.610
about going to prison.

06:30.645 --> 06:33.379
When Cam came back inside,
he was rattled.

06:33.413 --> 06:34.848
And before that guy left,

06:34.882 --> 06:35.882
he told Cam that he'd be coming back.

06:35.916 --> 06:37.283
This guy show up again?

06:37.317 --> 06:39.252
Nah, but I got the feeling
Cam was scared of him.

06:39.286 --> 06:40.886
Because normally
he'd come back to the garage

06:40.920 --> 06:42.221
for his 3:00 A.M. lunch break.

06:42.256 --> 06:43.656
But since that guy showed up,

06:43.690 --> 06:44.723
he'd be staying out all night,

06:44.758 --> 06:47.793
like he was scared to come back here.

06:47.827 --> 06:49.328
This guy... can you describe him?

06:49.363 --> 06:51.197
I didn't really get a look at his face.

06:51.231 --> 06:52.731
But oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:52.766 --> 06:54.332
He had this, uh, tattoo on his arm.

06:54.367 --> 06:55.834
It was pretty spectacular.

06:55.869 --> 06:58.436
It was a wolf... teeth bared...
howling at a moon.

06:58.471 --> 07:02.908
- Wow, a howling wolf tattoo? That's pretty
specific. - Mm.

07:02.942 --> 07:04.442
If this guy did time,
there should be a record of it

07:04.477 --> 07:06.011
in the prison tattoo database.

07:06.046 --> 07:09.148
Esposito's checking right now.
Any idea whose kid this is?

07:09.182 --> 07:11.650
Uh, there's no reports
of any missing babies.

07:11.684 --> 07:13.685
Okay, how about our victim?

07:13.719 --> 07:15.387
Well, aside from
a handful of speeding tickets

07:15.421 --> 07:17.355
back in the day, he's clean.

07:17.390 --> 07:19.558
All of his friends say
that he was quiet,

07:19.592 --> 07:20.825
he was hard-working,

07:20.859 --> 07:22.460
and completely devoted to his wife.

07:22.495 --> 07:24.996
Huh. Guy takes off for work
at 10:00 P.M. and never arrives.

07:25.030 --> 07:27.331
And then at 6:45 the next morning,

07:27.365 --> 07:29.366
he shows up shot to death at a church...

07:29.401 --> 07:31.869
holding somebody else's baby.

07:31.904 --> 07:34.271
What the hell happened during
those eight hours?

07:35.640 --> 07:38.009
Hey, so <i>that's "a couple of things"?</i>

07:38.043 --> 07:40.277
Yeah, I just grabbed the essentials,

07:40.312 --> 07:43.052
you know, uh, diapers,
a carrier, wipes, blankies,

07:43.077 --> 07:45.942
bottles, formula, don't want
little Cosmo going hungry.

07:45.983 --> 07:48.352
- Cosmo, huh?
- Yeah.

07:48.386 --> 07:51.021
- We can't just keep calling him "the baby."
- Uh, why "Cosmo"?

07:51.055 --> 07:53.824
- It's what I was gonna call Alexis if she
was a boy.  - Ah.

07:53.858 --> 07:55.292
A... turkey outfit?

07:55.327 --> 07:58.128
- Really?
- It's a Turkey <i>onesie. It's Thanksgiving.</i>

07:58.162 --> 08:00.797
It was expensive, but <i>it's adorable.</i>

08:00.832 --> 08:03.299
And like I said, my family
dresses up for Thanksgiving.

08:03.334 --> 08:05.301
Oh.

08:05.336 --> 08:08.404
I'm suddenly getting
a clear and frightening visual

08:08.439 --> 08:10.173
as to what my future will look like.

08:10.208 --> 08:12.675
Hey, Castle, um, mind if I... hold him?

08:12.710 --> 08:14.111
It'd be good experience for me.

08:14.145 --> 08:15.612
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.
- All right. Good.

08:15.646 --> 08:17.046
- Ready?
- Oh, yeah.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.048
Uh...

08:19.082 --> 08:20.983
- Put his head there.
- I know.

08:21.017 --> 08:23.018
Hold him under so that...

08:23.053 --> 08:25.255
I know.

08:27.991 --> 08:29.825
He's crying. What am I doing wrong?

08:29.860 --> 08:31.994
Just try to remain calm.
They can sense fear.

08:33.296 --> 08:35.131
This is not at all
like the practice doll.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.201
I thought I was ready.

08:39.236 --> 08:41.837
- Clearly, I am not.
- All right.

08:41.871 --> 08:43.139
Oh, God, I'm not ready.

08:46.309 --> 08:47.877
- Oh, he really likes you.
- Oh, yeah.

08:47.911 --> 08:49.678
I don't know if you know this about me...

08:49.712 --> 08:51.513
babies love me.

08:51.547 --> 08:53.348
I'm the baby whisperer.

08:55.618 --> 08:56.918
Wanna hold him?

08:56.952 --> 08:59.388
Uh, no. I'd rather
figure out where he came from.

08:59.422 --> 09:01.356
- Well, when a m...
- Stop.

09:01.391 --> 09:02.924
Stop. I know where babies
come from, Castle.

09:02.958 --> 09:04.192
Just... not this one.

09:04.226 --> 09:06.127
I can't believe you don't
want to hold the baby.

09:06.162 --> 09:07.195
Everyone wants to hold the baby.

09:07.229 --> 09:08.797
I don't want to hold that baby.

09:08.831 --> 09:12.233
So I got a hit in the, uh,
prison tattoo database.

09:12.268 --> 09:14.002
- Mm-hmm.
- Check it out.

09:14.036 --> 09:15.770
Just like Roman described it.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.072
Yep. Belongs to one Jimmy Wolfinsky...

09:18.107 --> 09:19.607
a.k.a. "Jimmy The Wolf."

09:19.641 --> 09:22.109
Suspected in a handful
of bank and jewelry jobs.

09:22.143 --> 09:24.278
He was arrested seven years ago

09:24.313 --> 09:25.813
and convicted when
a bank robbery went south.

09:25.847 --> 09:28.716
He just got paroled two weeks ago.

09:28.750 --> 09:29.983
Any connection to our victim?

09:30.018 --> 09:31.298
Well, the bank that he robbed...

09:31.320 --> 09:32.486
Jimmy would have gotten away,

09:32.521 --> 09:33.854
but when he came outside the building,

09:33.888 --> 09:35.323
his getaway car was gone.

09:35.357 --> 09:36.890
Jimmy's partner bolted
when the alarm sounded.

09:36.925 --> 09:38.726
Cops never caught him,
and Jimmy never ratted.

09:38.759 --> 09:41.261
But... witnesses were able
to provide a sketch

09:41.296 --> 09:43.697
of the getaway driver. Look familiar?

09:45.666 --> 09:47.301
That's Cameron Ducane... our victim.

09:47.335 --> 09:50.003
Our mild-mannered limo driver
had a criminal past.

09:50.038 --> 09:53.140
Looks like that past
just caught up with him.

09:53.174 --> 09:57.674
Castle 6x10 - The Good, The Bad & The Baby
Original air date November 25, 2013

09:57.699 --> 10:01.399
Sync and corrections by atrn97g
for www.addic7ed.com

10:01.497 --> 10:05.648
So... it's a tale of betrayal
and revenge.

10:06.119 --> 10:08.086
Cameron abandons his partner Jimmy

10:08.121 --> 10:10.455
when he comes down,
leaving him to take the fall.

10:10.489 --> 10:13.525
Ridden with remorse, Cameron
tries to put it all behind him,

10:13.559 --> 10:15.226
start his life anew.

10:15.260 --> 10:18.430
But surprise, surprise,

10:18.464 --> 10:19.597
Jimmy made parole,

10:19.632 --> 10:20.965
after spending seven long years

10:20.999 --> 10:22.834
thinking of ways
to make his old partner pay.

10:22.868 --> 10:24.436
No wonder Cameron was adding locks.

10:24.470 --> 10:25.903
He didn't want
to tell his wife about it,

10:25.938 --> 10:27.572
because he didn't want her
to know about is criminal past.

10:27.606 --> 10:28.940
That's a great theory, Castle,

10:28.974 --> 10:31.642
except where did the baby come from?

10:31.676 --> 10:33.477
Ah. Maybe...

10:35.513 --> 10:37.315
- Nope, I got nothing.
- Hmm.

10:37.349 --> 10:38.916
I just talked Jimmy The Wolf's
parole officer.

10:38.951 --> 10:40.517
Jimmy's got an apartment in Queens.

10:40.552 --> 10:42.386
Okay. Head up there.
See if you can track him down.

10:42.420 --> 10:44.621
Whatever happened last night...
he was a part of it.

10:44.656 --> 10:46.890
Don't you worry, little Cosmo.

10:46.924 --> 10:47.958
These guys are the best.

10:47.992 --> 10:49.727
If anyone can find your folks,
it's them.

10:49.761 --> 10:52.963
Except we have double-checked
with hospitals, the F.B.I.,

10:52.997 --> 10:55.666
and the N.C.M.E.C., and nothing.

10:55.700 --> 10:57.668
If someone was missing their baby,

10:57.702 --> 10:58.982
wouldn't they have come forward?

10:59.003 --> 11:00.324
Maybe they don't know he's gone...

11:00.338 --> 11:03.006
Or maybe they're not alive.

11:03.040 --> 11:04.881
I mean, we don't know
what happened that night.

11:06.710 --> 11:09.279
Well, whatever happened,
happened near that church.

11:09.313 --> 11:10.513
Lanie, what are you doing here?

11:10.547 --> 11:13.116
I had some information.
I thought I'd come by

11:13.150 --> 11:15.785
and check on my little patient.

11:15.819 --> 11:18.821
Hi, you little doodle bug.

11:18.856 --> 11:21.090
How you doin'?

11:21.124 --> 11:23.559
What makes you think Cameron
was shot near the church?

11:23.594 --> 11:25.528
Well, based on the nature
and the severity

11:25.562 --> 11:27.930
of the wounds, your victim maybe had

11:27.964 --> 11:30.733
only five or ten minutes
before he bled out.

11:30.768 --> 11:32.368
He couldn't have driven that far.

11:32.403 --> 11:34.069
20 blocks at most.

11:34.104 --> 11:38.007
I also found something unusual
under his fingernails.

11:38.041 --> 11:41.743
Wax residue, charred nitrocellulose...

11:41.778 --> 11:42.945
and camphor.

11:42.979 --> 11:45.114
- Nitrocellulose?
- Yes.

11:45.148 --> 11:46.848
It's used to make celluloid.

11:46.883 --> 11:49.952
You can find it in old film stock,

11:49.986 --> 11:53.087
certain kinds of plastic,
but it's highly flammable.

11:53.122 --> 11:55.123
- Isn't it?
- Charred celluloid...

11:55.157 --> 11:56.425
where would that come from?

11:56.459 --> 11:58.359
Beats me. That's your job.

11:58.394 --> 12:01.897
Right now my job is to play
with the little baby.

12:01.931 --> 12:04.599
Yes, it is!

12:04.634 --> 12:06.435
Yo.

12:06.469 --> 12:07.702
Jimmy's apartment is empty,

12:07.737 --> 12:09.237
and his landlord
hasn't seen him in days.

12:09.271 --> 12:10.704
Well, if he killed Cameron,

12:10.739 --> 12:12.259
he's probably halfway to Mexico by now.

12:12.274 --> 12:13.774
All right, I'll put out
a B.O.L.O. on him,

12:13.809 --> 12:15.209
check in with his parole officer,

12:15.244 --> 12:17.045
see if he's got
a list of known associates.

12:17.079 --> 12:18.365
He just got out of prison.

12:18.397 --> 12:20.081
If he's on the run, he's
gonna need some help.

12:20.115 --> 12:21.715
Yeah, yeah, and, uh, while you do that,

12:21.750 --> 12:22.917
I'm gonna duck inside.

12:22.952 --> 12:24.752
I feel a quick pick calling my name.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.720
- Are you serious?
- Two minutes, okay?

12:26.755 --> 12:28.789
Two minutes to fritter away
your unborn child's future?

12:28.824 --> 12:31.559
Frittering or <i>investing?</i>

12:31.593 --> 12:33.461
Yo, this is detective Esposito.

12:33.495 --> 12:34.995
I need to put out a B.O.L.O.

12:35.029 --> 12:36.697
on a Jimmy Wolfins...

12:39.267 --> 12:40.434
Never mind. I think I found him.

12:41.669 --> 12:43.070
Yo, Jimmy!

12:44.339 --> 12:46.139
Hey!

12:46.174 --> 12:47.975
Come here.

12:49.177 --> 12:50.643
49...

12:50.678 --> 12:52.212
9...

12:52.246 --> 12:53.246
36...

12:55.716 --> 12:58.284
- Uhh!
- Uhh!

12:58.318 --> 12:59.418
Where you running to, pal?

13:06.560 --> 13:08.127
Hey! See?

13:08.161 --> 13:09.496
I knew this place was lucky.

13:09.530 --> 13:11.297
Come on.

13:11.331 --> 13:14.766
Hmm, see that man?

13:14.801 --> 13:16.668
That is a bad man.

13:16.703 --> 13:18.137
He's gonna confess.

13:18.171 --> 13:20.072
Then we're gonna know just who you are.

13:20.107 --> 13:22.541
- Castle, mind if I try again?
- Of course.

13:22.575 --> 13:24.510
- Here you go.
- Hey.

13:24.544 --> 13:28.447
Oh.

13:33.419 --> 13:36.688
- On second thought, I'll just wait outside.
- No problem.

13:36.723 --> 13:38.724
- He's cute.
- Yeah.

13:39.926 --> 13:42.394
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

13:42.428 --> 13:45.163
- High five.
-  Good job.

13:45.197 --> 13:46.498
<i>Mr. Wolfinsky,</i>

13:46.533 --> 13:49.067
do you recognize this man?

13:50.236 --> 13:51.869
Never seen him before in my life.

13:51.904 --> 13:53.238
Really?

13:53.272 --> 13:55.540
I think he looks a lot
like your old partner...

13:55.574 --> 13:58.009
the one who left you to get busted

13:58.044 --> 13:59.911
at that bank job seven years ago.

13:59.945 --> 14:02.247
Doesn't ring a bell.

14:02.281 --> 14:05.049
That's a grown-up lying.

14:05.083 --> 14:06.651
Get used to that.

14:06.685 --> 14:07.985
<i>Must have ate at ya, huh?</i>

14:08.020 --> 14:09.687
All those nights in the joint.

14:09.721 --> 14:11.088
Knowing you were in there rotting away,

14:11.122 --> 14:13.024
while he was out there <i>free</i>

14:13.058 --> 14:14.992
because he ditched you at the bank.

14:15.027 --> 14:17.562
Like I told the D.A.,
I didn't have a partner.

14:17.596 --> 14:20.564
And if I did, I ain't no rat.

14:20.598 --> 14:21.865
What about...

14:21.899 --> 14:23.700
a murderer?

14:25.236 --> 14:27.171
- Cam's dead?
- So you <i>do</i> know him?

14:27.205 --> 14:29.440
Yeah, okay, but I had
nothing to do with this.

14:29.474 --> 14:32.943
The day you make parole,
he installs a security system,

14:32.977 --> 14:34.945
gets all new locks.

14:34.979 --> 14:36.113
Now why would he do that?

14:36.147 --> 14:37.981
Because...

14:38.015 --> 14:39.282
I don't know, when I was convicted,

14:39.316 --> 14:41.985
I may have told some folks
that, uh, Cam will pay.

14:42.019 --> 14:44.821
But that was years ago.

14:44.855 --> 14:46.189
Look, the truth is,

14:46.223 --> 14:47.663
I was the one who messed up that day.

14:47.692 --> 14:49.292
I got hung up inside.

14:49.326 --> 14:50.794
Cam waited as long as he could...

14:50.828 --> 14:52.128
longer than he should've.

14:52.162 --> 14:53.729
I told him that. He knew we were square.

14:53.763 --> 14:55.864
Witnesses at Cam's work say otherwise.

14:55.899 --> 14:57.500
Said you two were fighting,
that afterwards...

14:57.534 --> 15:01.804
- Cam was scared to come back
to the garage at night. <i>- What?</i>

15:01.838 --> 15:03.838
Nah, it's just, I'm trying
to get my life together,

15:03.840 --> 15:05.074
like he did.

15:05.109 --> 15:06.775
I thought maybe he could
put in a word with his boss,

15:06.810 --> 15:07.943
help me get a job driving.

15:07.978 --> 15:09.378
Well, that's funny.

15:09.413 --> 15:11.113
'Cause witnesses say that
the conversation was heated.

15:11.147 --> 15:12.447
Because he wouldn't help me.

15:12.482 --> 15:13.882
He told me he couldn't
be around me anymore,

15:13.917 --> 15:15.618
that that part of his life was over.

15:15.652 --> 15:17.385
After all I'd done for him,
keeping my mouth shut

15:17.420 --> 15:19.755
all those years, he couldn't
even put in a good word?

15:19.789 --> 15:21.790
That's the last I saw of him.

15:23.793 --> 15:25.928
Mr. Wolfinksy,
where were you last night?

15:25.962 --> 15:28.796
I was with my girlfriend out in Jersey.

15:28.831 --> 15:29.964
I've been with her all week.

15:29.999 --> 15:32.234
What about this morning,
between 6:00 and 7:00?

15:32.268 --> 15:33.568
We were having breakfast at a diner.

15:33.603 --> 15:36.471
People saw us.
Look, I <i>swear</i> this wasn't me.

15:36.506 --> 15:41.075
Have you ever seen this baby before?

15:41.110 --> 15:42.810
No.

15:42.845 --> 15:44.445
What's a baby gotta do with this?

15:45.981 --> 15:47.715
Well, he's telling the truth.

15:47.750 --> 15:49.583
According to his girlfriend
and a roommate,

15:49.618 --> 15:52.020
he spent the last few days
at their apartment in Jersey.

15:52.054 --> 15:53.454
And a waitress at that diner

15:53.488 --> 15:55.589
- places him there during the shooting
window. - Yeah.

15:55.624 --> 15:56.924
Okay, well, if Jimmy
was telling the truth,

15:56.959 --> 15:59.393
then Cam didn't have any reason
to be afraid of him.

15:59.427 --> 16:01.428
And why was he avoiding the limo garage

16:01.463 --> 16:03.197
at his 3:00 A.M. lunch break?

16:03.231 --> 16:05.699
Maybe he wasn't avoiding it.

16:05.733 --> 16:07.834
Maybe something else was going on.

16:07.869 --> 16:10.137
Most limo companies use G.P.S. services

16:10.172 --> 16:11.805
to track their vehicles.
Maybe they can tell us

16:11.839 --> 16:13.807
where Cam was going all those nights.

16:13.841 --> 16:16.209
On it.

16:16.243 --> 16:17.811
Uh, excuse me, detective Beckett?

16:17.845 --> 16:19.512
- Yeah.
- Hi.

16:19.547 --> 16:20.981
Sandra Whitman... child services.

16:21.015 --> 16:23.050
Sorry it took me so long to get here.

16:23.084 --> 16:24.364
This time of year is always bad.

16:24.385 --> 16:26.219
Oh, no, uh, not a problem.

16:26.253 --> 16:28.388
- He's right in the lounge.
- Oh, great, thanks.

16:28.422 --> 16:30.590
Um, uh... what's gonna happen to him?

16:30.624 --> 16:32.258
County facilities don't
currently have any beds.

16:32.293 --> 16:35.061
So we're working to find
a foster family to take him.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.495
I'll let you know as soon as we do.

16:36.497 --> 16:38.698
Thank you.

16:40.701 --> 16:42.101
I don't know if we should

16:42.135 --> 16:44.337
just be handing him over to strangers.

16:44.371 --> 16:45.705
<i>Hi.</i>

16:45.739 --> 16:47.973
Castle, we were strangers
until this morning.

16:48.008 --> 16:50.342
How can you be logical
in the face of that face?

16:50.376 --> 16:52.477
Well, because I have to be.
I mean, we don't know

16:52.512 --> 16:55.181
what's gonna happen to Cosmo.
We can't get attached.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.683
Is that why you won't hold him?

16:57.718 --> 16:59.384
Yes.

17:00.587 --> 17:04.388
Okay. Fine.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.156
I've never really been a baby person.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.059
I mean, some people see babies

17:08.094 --> 17:09.627
and they want to hold them,
they want to nibble their toes,

17:09.662 --> 17:12.097
and I've never been
one of those people. So...

17:13.453 --> 17:15.670
Oh.

17:15.789 --> 17:18.086
I did not know that about you.

17:18.252 --> 17:19.838
I suppose you hate rainbows, too.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.473
I don't hate babies, Castle.

17:21.507 --> 17:23.074
I just don't see the appeal.

17:23.108 --> 17:25.210
But I'm sure I'll feel differently

17:25.243 --> 17:27.645
when we have one of our own.

17:30.249 --> 17:32.217
Will you?

17:33.719 --> 17:35.019
Will you?!

17:35.054 --> 17:37.956
Okay, so we pulled G.P.S. information

17:37.990 --> 17:40.190
from the past six nights
that Cameron was at work,

17:40.225 --> 17:41.626
and nothing out of the ordinary.

17:41.660 --> 17:43.961
Until we took a look at his lunch hour.

17:43.995 --> 17:45.429
- Check it out.
- Every night at 3:00 A.M...

17:45.464 --> 17:47.131
he'd go off shift,

17:47.165 --> 17:48.366
and he would drive here.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.933
The Colfax building downtown?

17:49.968 --> 17:51.769
But he wouldn't stay long. Watch.

17:51.803 --> 17:54.037
Every night, he would drive
to the same destination...

17:54.072 --> 17:55.739
a block in Alphabet City.

17:55.774 --> 17:57.241
Each night he would take
a different route,

17:57.275 --> 17:59.276
and he'd do it over and over again.

18:02.113 --> 18:04.148
Only one reason I can think
why someone like him

18:04.182 --> 18:05.382
would be doing something like that.

18:05.416 --> 18:08.752
He was practicing escape routes.

18:08.787 --> 18:10.921
Cam was back in the life.

18:13.257 --> 18:16.693
He was planning a getaway.

18:22.958 --> 18:25.691
We scrubbed traffic cam
footage from the Colfax building

18:25.708 --> 18:28.300
between the time Cameron left
his house that night,

18:28.324 --> 18:30.753
- to when he arrived at the church.
- And we found this

18:30.793 --> 18:32.761
behind the Colfax building.

18:32.795 --> 18:34.288
That's his car.

18:34.330 --> 18:35.874
Two guys are with him.

18:35.898 --> 18:37.332
3:57 A.M.

18:37.367 --> 18:39.000
Where are they going
with that briefcase?

18:39.035 --> 18:40.101
Don't know, but... then

18:40.136 --> 18:41.736
about 15 minutes later...

18:46.442 --> 18:49.144
Here they come. Same briefcase.

18:49.178 --> 18:50.745
It's a heist...

18:50.780 --> 18:53.414
And Cam is the wheelman.

18:53.448 --> 18:55.349
- What's in the building?
- Uh, high-end offices,

18:55.384 --> 18:57.652
jewelry store, real estate,
and law offices,

18:57.687 --> 18:59.487
the TV station, and a couple of banks.

18:59.521 --> 19:00.488
I checked the blotter.

19:00.522 --> 19:01.856
There were no reports of any break-ins

19:01.891 --> 19:03.257
from anyone at that address.

19:03.292 --> 19:05.226
Well, they might not know
they have been hit.

19:05.260 --> 19:07.261
Is there any evidence
of the baby in the footage?

19:07.296 --> 19:09.930
Nope. Only three men and a mustang.

19:09.964 --> 19:11.599
So where did Cosmo come from?

19:11.633 --> 19:14.935
Must be from wherever
Cameron was between 4:12 A.M.

19:14.969 --> 19:16.470
and when he was shot at 6:30.

19:16.505 --> 19:18.272
Canvass the area in Alphabet City

19:18.307 --> 19:19.707
where Cameron's practice route ended.

19:19.741 --> 19:21.675
See if you can figure out
where those guys were holed up.

19:21.710 --> 19:23.510
Castle and I will head down
to the Colfax building.

19:23.544 --> 19:25.946
Someone down there must know
what these guys took.

19:25.980 --> 19:28.615
I'm sorry, detective.
As head of security,

19:28.649 --> 19:30.150
I checked with all our tenants.

19:30.185 --> 19:31.651
As far as we can tell,
nothing was taken.

19:31.686 --> 19:34.088
Well, nothing? Are you sure?

19:34.122 --> 19:36.023
Uh, Mr. Dennis,

19:36.057 --> 19:37.924
how... how's your security system?

19:37.958 --> 19:39.025
State of the art...

19:39.059 --> 19:41.528
good camera coverage, motion detectors.

19:41.562 --> 19:43.430
We double-checked all our systems.

19:43.464 --> 19:46.299
No wires were cut,
no alarms were triggered,

19:46.334 --> 19:47.967
no elevators called.

19:48.001 --> 19:49.769
There's just no evidence
of anyone entering the building.

19:49.803 --> 19:52.071
Then how do you explain this?

19:52.106 --> 19:53.372
Two masked guys entering
your parking lot

19:53.406 --> 19:54.640
at 4:00 A.M.?

19:54.674 --> 19:57.210
I don't know.

19:57.244 --> 19:59.204
It's possible they never
got past the parking gate

19:59.213 --> 20:00.747
and just gave up.

20:02.916 --> 20:04.383
Still, we're gonna need to examine

20:04.417 --> 20:06.786
- all the surveillance from last night,
Mr. Dennis. - Of course.

20:06.820 --> 20:08.054
I'll also get you a list of our tenants,

20:08.088 --> 20:09.622
if you want to follow up.

20:09.656 --> 20:12.625
A heist where nothing was taken.

20:12.659 --> 20:14.593
Maybe this is a classic

20:14.628 --> 20:16.828
"no honor among thieves" situation.

20:16.863 --> 20:18.664
You know, heist goes wrong, they fight.

20:18.698 --> 20:21.867
Where someone gets shot
running away with a baby?

20:21.901 --> 20:23.902
Not-so-classic

20:23.936 --> 20:25.203
"no honor among thieves" situation?

20:25.238 --> 20:27.038
No.

20:27.073 --> 20:29.507
Hey, earlier just got me thinking,

20:29.541 --> 20:32.844
our baby's due in a month,

20:32.879 --> 20:36.014
and I can't stop it.
What if I'm really not ready?

20:36.048 --> 20:37.682
Well, you're not ready.

20:37.716 --> 20:40.185
- What?
- Nobody is.

20:40.219 --> 20:43.488
Look, being a dad is like being a cop.

20:43.522 --> 20:45.790
It doesn't matter what they
teach you in the academy,

20:45.824 --> 20:48.192
you learn on the streets.
You did okay with that, right?

20:48.226 --> 20:51.896
Uh, my first day, I was so nervous,

20:51.930 --> 20:53.197
I rear-ended a S.W.A.T. van,

20:53.231 --> 20:55.533
and ten guys in vests poured out,

20:55.567 --> 20:59.536
ready to take me down
with extreme prejudice.

20:59.570 --> 21:01.272
Well...

21:01.306 --> 21:03.174
you care.

21:03.208 --> 21:05.075
That already makes you
a hundred times better

21:05.110 --> 21:06.410
than the dad I had.

21:07.946 --> 21:09.346
This is it.

21:09.380 --> 21:10.747
This is where Cam's route ended.

21:16.387 --> 21:19.022
Hey, Espo. Check it out.

21:19.056 --> 21:20.424
A bullet hole.

21:28.866 --> 21:30.133
The building's scheduled to be torn down

21:30.167 --> 21:31.702
the end of the month.

21:31.736 --> 21:33.536
Making this a perfect hideout.

21:33.570 --> 21:35.404
- Over here.
- Yeah.

21:35.439 --> 21:37.807
We think this is where
Cam's killer fired from.

21:37.842 --> 21:39.108
Is that powder residue?

21:39.143 --> 21:41.077
Probably broke the window with his elbow

21:41.111 --> 21:42.445
before firing down at Cameron.

21:46.783 --> 21:48.417
This building is about a 5-minute drive

21:48.452 --> 21:49.518
to that church.

21:51.087 --> 21:52.955
Something caught fire here recently.

21:52.989 --> 21:54.390
Very recently.

21:54.424 --> 21:55.991
There's also signs of a fight...

21:56.025 --> 21:59.194
blood spatter on the walls.
Don't know whose.

22:00.797 --> 22:03.232
<i>And</i> we found this.

22:05.468 --> 22:06.735
Cosmo was here.

22:06.769 --> 22:08.904
Okay, so this must be
where Cameron got him from.

22:08.938 --> 22:13.475
What was a baby doing here
in the first place?

22:13.509 --> 22:16.745
Get C.S.U. down here.
Have them tear this place apart.

22:16.779 --> 22:18.713
Prints, trace, anything
that'll help us identify

22:18.748 --> 22:20.883
- whoever else was involved.
- Right.

22:26.822 --> 22:28.990
You okay?

22:29.024 --> 22:31.793
Yeah. I just keep wondering
about whose blood that was

22:31.827 --> 22:33.327
on the wall of the hideout.

22:33.362 --> 22:36.498
Every time I think about it,
I don't like how the story ends.

22:36.532 --> 22:38.032
Well, I've contacted every business

22:38.066 --> 22:39.700
in the Colfax building.

22:39.734 --> 22:41.802
No thefts and no missing babies.

22:41.836 --> 22:44.505
Hey. We took another look
at Jimmy Wolfinsky.

22:44.539 --> 22:46.240
If he is involved,
we can't find a connection.

22:46.275 --> 22:47.942
I spoke to Cameron's wife again.

22:47.976 --> 22:49.944
There's no indication
of any new friends in his life.

22:49.978 --> 22:52.113
But they were having money issues.

22:52.147 --> 22:53.580
They were on the verge
of losing their house.

22:53.615 --> 22:55.982
So odds are, whatever
he was doing was for the money.

22:56.017 --> 22:57.518
But there was nothing unusual
in his phone records,

22:57.552 --> 22:58.952
and no activity that night.

22:58.986 --> 23:00.466
Well, C.S.U. is just getting started,

23:00.488 --> 23:02.122
and we're not gonna learn
anything more until tomorrow,

23:02.156 --> 23:03.524
- so...
- All right.

23:03.558 --> 23:04.525
- Good night.
- Good night, guys.

23:04.559 --> 23:07.761
We should probably get going, too.

23:07.796 --> 23:10.330
You know, even though he had been shot,

23:10.364 --> 23:13.233
Cameron did everything he could
to keep that baby safe.

23:13.267 --> 23:15.668
That doesn't seem like
the actions of a bad guy.

23:15.702 --> 23:17.470
Yeah, well, he's probably not a bad guy.

23:17.504 --> 23:20.140
He just made a bad choice
and got in over his head.

23:20.174 --> 23:23.443
Now come on. Let's go home.

23:23.477 --> 23:25.678
Shh, it's okay.

23:25.712 --> 23:29.281
It's okay, shh. Hush, hush, hush.

23:29.316 --> 23:32.418
Oh, no. What's wrong, Cosmo?

23:32.453 --> 23:34.587
- You're still here?
- Yeah.

23:34.621 --> 23:36.355
I've been trying to locate
a foster family.

23:36.389 --> 23:37.590
But because it's Thanksgiving week,

23:37.624 --> 23:39.058
no one's available.

23:39.092 --> 23:41.253
I'm gonna have to bring him
to the County Crisis Center

23:41.261 --> 23:43.228
until I can find someone
who can take him.

23:43.263 --> 23:44.903
I thought you said
there weren't any beds.

23:44.931 --> 23:46.698
When it's this crowded,
they have to double up.

23:46.732 --> 23:48.566
There's no other options?

23:48.600 --> 23:50.401
That's the only place
that can take an infant.

23:50.436 --> 23:52.270
Well, what if we take him?

23:52.304 --> 23:53.371
Wait...

23:53.405 --> 23:54.839
what?

23:54.873 --> 23:56.841
Well, we've already bonded.
I... I got all the stuff.

23:56.875 --> 23:59.243
No, no. Castle, I told you.

23:59.278 --> 24:01.579
I know, I know. You haven't been
around babies that much.

24:01.613 --> 24:03.047
Not a big deal.

24:03.082 --> 24:05.649
I got this. I'm the baby whisperer.

24:05.684 --> 24:08.218
Look, she's not gonna just
give you a baby.

24:08.252 --> 24:09.419
I'm sure that there are
background checks

24:09.454 --> 24:12.422
and forms that
we have to fill out, right?

24:12.457 --> 24:15.225
Not... if the baby officially remains

24:15.259 --> 24:17.928
in the custody of the N.Y.P.D.

24:17.963 --> 24:19.797
And you guys have done...

24:19.831 --> 24:21.231
an amazing job so far.

24:22.533 --> 24:24.134
What do you say, Beckett?

24:25.203 --> 24:26.636
Wanna have a baby?

24:31.476 --> 24:32.842
Come on! It'll be fun.

24:34.479 --> 24:37.480
Sorry.

24:48.354 --> 24:49.621
This is so not fun.

24:49.656 --> 24:50.756
Castle, if this is a part of your plan

24:50.791 --> 24:52.258
to turn me into a baby person,

24:52.292 --> 24:53.425
it's not working.

24:53.459 --> 24:54.426
It isn't.

24:54.460 --> 24:56.796
Well, it was, at first. But...

24:56.830 --> 24:58.497
he was so good at the precinct.

24:58.531 --> 25:00.699
- I thought you were the "baby whisperer."
- I am.

25:00.733 --> 25:02.902
There's something wrong with this baby.

25:02.936 --> 25:04.936
Ooh, okay! So, it says here that,

25:04.970 --> 25:08.106
"gently bouncing your baby
should calm him or her down."

25:08.140 --> 25:10.676
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.477
I got an idea.

25:12.512 --> 25:14.346
Shh, shh, okay.

25:14.380 --> 25:16.581
You're making me look bad, kid.

25:16.616 --> 25:18.617
Anything you want, okay, buddy?

25:18.651 --> 25:21.619
You just tell me what it is,
I will give it to you.

25:21.653 --> 25:23.254
Okay, shh.

25:23.289 --> 25:25.957
Here, sit. Bounce.

25:25.991 --> 25:27.859
Okay, okay, okay.

25:32.664 --> 25:33.965
Ooh, it's working.

25:33.999 --> 25:36.767
Yeah. You're a genius.

25:42.907 --> 25:44.545
Do not laugh.

25:44.577 --> 25:45.911
I'm not laughing.

25:45.945 --> 25:48.981
You do not laugh. Get me the towel.

25:49.016 --> 25:50.149
Okay, here.

25:50.183 --> 25:52.051
- Here, take him.
- Huh?

25:52.085 --> 25:54.686
- Take him.
- Okay.

25:54.721 --> 25:56.989
Come on. Thank you. Here we go.

25:57.023 --> 25:59.124
- There we go.
- Hey!

25:59.158 --> 26:01.092
- Here we go...
- Not on the rug.

26:01.127 --> 26:02.460
Okay. We're gonna go up...

26:02.495 --> 26:04.796
- Not on that chair.
- Okay.

26:04.831 --> 26:06.131
Put him on the blanket.
I hate that blanket.

26:06.165 --> 26:08.867
We're going on the nasty blanket.

26:08.902 --> 26:11.617
Yeah, okay, good.

26:11.664 --> 26:14.406
- Hold him, or he'll roll off.
- Yes.

26:14.440 --> 26:16.074
Castle, I think he
needs a change of clothes.

26:16.108 --> 26:17.909
- Uh, get him undressed. I'll get a onesie.
- Okay.

26:17.943 --> 26:22.047
Changin', changin'...

26:22.081 --> 26:23.048
And a new diaper.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.316
- Uh, all right, switch.
- Yeah.

26:25.351 --> 26:26.350
Here.

26:26.723 --> 26:27.723
Okay.

26:27.758 --> 26:29.192
Wipes.

26:32.629 --> 26:33.863
Lotion.

26:37.201 --> 26:38.634
Diaper.

26:42.439 --> 26:45.841
Onesie.

26:45.876 --> 26:46.876
And...

26:48.745 --> 26:49.779
victory.

26:49.813 --> 26:51.580
We've done it.

26:51.615 --> 26:53.549
All right.

26:53.583 --> 26:56.351
- You hold him.
- Okay, all right.

26:56.386 --> 26:59.788
There we go. I'll take care of... this.

26:59.822 --> 27:02.257
Okay.

27:04.193 --> 27:06.261
Uncle Rick's pretty funny, huh?

27:06.296 --> 27:08.630
I think you're pretty funny, too.

27:08.664 --> 27:10.698
Ugh.

27:14.938 --> 27:16.438
What?

27:16.472 --> 27:18.372
Nothing.

27:18.407 --> 27:19.541
All right.

27:19.575 --> 27:23.144
Now all we have to do
is get him to sleep.

27:25.815 --> 27:27.749
Well, you are a hungry boy.

27:27.783 --> 27:29.484
Yes, you are.

27:29.518 --> 27:32.053
Good for you.

27:32.087 --> 27:34.588
Oh, well, look who's up.

27:41.363 --> 27:43.564
How long have I been gone?

27:47.469 --> 27:50.871
Coffee's not even helping.

27:50.905 --> 27:53.073
I'd forgotten about this part.

27:53.107 --> 27:55.976
Whoa.

27:56.010 --> 27:59.713
You two look like
you got hit by the milk truck.

27:59.747 --> 28:01.648
You see this face?

28:01.683 --> 28:04.184
- This is the face of your future.
- That bad, huh?

28:04.218 --> 28:06.719
No, no, no, we slept like babies.

28:06.753 --> 28:09.822
Yeah, up every hour.

28:09.857 --> 28:10.957
Where is the little guy?

28:10.992 --> 28:13.860
Martha and Alexis
offered to babysit him.

28:13.894 --> 28:15.761
They said they're gonna
make a day out of it.

28:15.796 --> 28:18.498
So, where are we on, um...

28:18.532 --> 28:20.500
- Child services?
- Child services.

28:20.534 --> 28:22.267
Still no reports of a missing baby.

28:22.302 --> 28:24.342
But while you two were
bouncing junior on your knee,

28:24.371 --> 28:25.605
C.S.U. reports came in.

28:25.639 --> 28:27.507
Whoever was there
cleaned up after themselves.

28:27.541 --> 28:29.041
The place was wiped down for prints.

28:29.075 --> 28:30.376
What about that fire?

28:30.410 --> 28:33.245
Analysis of the burn
showed high concentration

28:33.279 --> 28:35.114
nitrocellulose and camphor.

28:35.148 --> 28:36.382
Charred celluloid.

28:36.416 --> 28:39.351
- Just like on Cameron.
- That blood we found...

28:39.386 --> 28:41.053
according to genetic markers,

28:41.087 --> 28:42.854
came from someone related to that baby.

28:42.889 --> 28:45.624
But without anything else to go on,

28:45.658 --> 28:47.059
all we know is that they <i>are</i> related.

28:47.093 --> 28:48.693
We still don't know
who either of them are.

28:48.728 --> 28:50.129
What about Cameron? He must've known.

28:50.163 --> 28:52.831
We rechecked his phones,
friends, and financials.

28:52.865 --> 28:54.199
Whatever was going on, he hid it well.

28:54.234 --> 28:55.901
And since no one in that office building

28:55.935 --> 28:56.968
knows what our thieves were after,

28:57.003 --> 28:58.269
we're back at square one.

28:58.303 --> 29:00.204
Maybe not.

29:00.239 --> 29:01.239
Why? What are you thinking?

29:01.273 --> 29:03.207
I... given how much baby garbage

29:03.242 --> 29:04.943
we generated in just one night,

29:04.977 --> 29:07.712
and how quickly they cleaned
and vacated that apartment

29:07.747 --> 29:09.080
after the shooting,

29:09.114 --> 29:11.149
I'm wondering where
all their garbage went.

29:13.018 --> 29:16.421
You take me to the most exotic places.

29:16.455 --> 29:18.322
Look, if you didn't wanna jump in,

29:18.357 --> 29:19.690
you could've just waited on the side

29:19.724 --> 29:21.192
like you usually do.

29:21.226 --> 29:23.428
What? Are you kidding?
After the puke storm

29:23.462 --> 29:25.063
I put you through last night,

29:25.097 --> 29:26.697
it felt wrong not to participate.

29:26.731 --> 29:28.498
Yeah.

29:28.533 --> 29:30.000
Which, by the way,
you were great last night.

29:30.035 --> 29:32.670
Thank you. You weren't so bad yourself.

29:32.704 --> 29:34.872
Well, I was no baby whisperer.

29:34.906 --> 29:37.608
You know, I... I gotta say,
when I... when I volunteered

29:37.642 --> 29:40.477
to take Cosmo, I... I thought
I was doing it for <i>his</i> benefit.

29:40.511 --> 29:45.415
But... I realized
I was doing it more for mine.

29:45.450 --> 29:49.919
I... when Alexis was little,
Meredith really wasn't around.

29:49.954 --> 29:51.788
So I... I did it all on my own.

29:51.822 --> 29:55.225
And when you said
you weren't a baby person...

29:55.259 --> 29:56.460
Oh, okay, okay. I get it.

29:56.494 --> 29:59.096
- You were thinking that...
- Yeah.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.497
Okay, well, I'll tell you what.

30:00.531 --> 30:01.998
When the time comes...

30:03.166 --> 30:04.667
there's no way I'm gonna let you

30:04.702 --> 30:06.335
take care of our baby on your own.

30:08.338 --> 30:10.039
Hey, guys!

30:10.074 --> 30:12.842
Got somethin'.

30:15.613 --> 30:17.246
Diapers.

30:17.280 --> 30:20.316
Same kind that Cosmo was wearing
when we found him.

30:20.350 --> 30:22.251
Cheap, non-biodegradable kind?

30:22.285 --> 30:24.685
- Well, that's just criminal.
- What else is in the bag?

30:27.491 --> 30:32.928
Wine preservation kit,
with, uh, ooh, argon canisters.

30:32.962 --> 30:34.596
Really? That's weird.

30:34.631 --> 30:36.732
Ping pong balls, paddles, and a net.

30:36.766 --> 30:37.966
Ping pong balls!

30:38.001 --> 30:39.967
Those are made of celluloid,
highly flammable.

30:40.002 --> 30:41.301
That's what caused the burn.

30:41.336 --> 30:43.370
Really? They were lighting
ping pong balls on fire?

30:45.206 --> 30:47.108
Okay, get the bags to C.S.U.,
see if they can pull prints.

30:47.142 --> 30:49.644
Oh, look, a receipt from three days ago

30:49.678 --> 30:52.046
for the diapers from a Quick Mart.

30:52.080 --> 30:53.247
Person paid cash.

30:53.281 --> 30:54.849
Does it have a time stamp?

30:54.883 --> 30:58.018
Here it is. 2:47 P.M.

30:58.052 --> 30:59.353
And there's our buyer.

31:01.623 --> 31:03.257
Turn your head.

31:05.693 --> 31:08.595
Come on, come on.

31:09.864 --> 31:11.365
Damn it.

31:11.399 --> 31:15.535
Okay, a wine preservation kit,
flaming ping pong balls,

31:15.569 --> 31:18.604
a missing baby, and a heist
where nothing was taken.

31:18.639 --> 31:21.274
I mean, each time we find
a piece of this puzzle,

31:21.308 --> 31:22.942
it makes less and less sense.

31:22.977 --> 31:25.411
There's something we're missing.

31:25.445 --> 31:26.846
- Something that...
-  - Oh, oh!

31:26.881 --> 31:28.748
It's time. It's time! It's time!

31:28.783 --> 31:31.484
Something that's
gonna make all the pieces fit.

31:31.518 --> 31:32.885
Shh, shh, shh, quiet, everybody!

31:32.919 --> 31:34.587
It's starting!

31:36.523 --> 31:39.225
Thank you so much.

31:40.727 --> 31:41.960
Wow, Ryan.

31:41.995 --> 31:43.796
- How many of these things did you buy...
- Shh!

31:43.830 --> 31:45.164
Baby needs an education.

31:46.566 --> 31:49.467
<i>Hello! I'm Miranda Vail,</i>

31:49.502 --> 31:53.105
<i>and this is</i>
<i>the 5 State Magicball Lottery.</i>

31:53.139 --> 31:56.474
<i>We have the largest pot</i>
<i>in 5 State history...</i>

31:56.509 --> 31:59.812
That something we're missing?
I think we just found it.

31:59.846 --> 32:02.181
- Sorry, Jen.
<i>- 247 million dollars.</i>

32:02.215 --> 32:04.482
<i>So let's see if there's</i>
<i>a winner out there.</i>

32:04.517 --> 32:06.050
You <i>could be next.</i>

32:06.085 --> 32:08.052
<i>Are you ready</i>
<i>for your dreams to come true?</i>

32:08.087 --> 32:09.654
Yes.

32:11.123 --> 32:12.824
<i>Here we go...</i>

32:14.860 --> 32:15.893
<i>40...</i>

32:15.928 --> 32:17.329
I've got that.

32:18.564 --> 32:19.964
<i>9...</i>

32:19.998 --> 32:21.332
- Another one.
- Yeah?

32:21.366 --> 32:23.801
22...

32:23.836 --> 32:25.169
<i>22...</i>

32:25.204 --> 32:26.470
17...

32:26.504 --> 32:29.573
<i>17...</i>

32:29.608 --> 32:31.242
37...

32:32.677 --> 32:34.112
<i>37...</i>

32:34.146 --> 32:36.747
<i>And the Magicball number is...</i>

32:36.781 --> 32:37.881
28.

32:37.915 --> 32:39.116
No way.

32:39.150 --> 32:40.851
<i>28.</i>

32:40.885 --> 32:42.886
- What the...
<i>- I'm Miranda Vail...</i>

32:42.920 --> 32:45.021
How'd you know that, Castle?

32:45.056 --> 32:47.491
It's Cameron's lottery ticket,
and it's motive.

32:47.525 --> 32:49.893
Esposito, you said
that there was a TV station

32:49.927 --> 32:51.128
in the Colfax building?

32:51.162 --> 32:52.729
Yeah, WQTI.

32:52.764 --> 32:55.465
Right, the break-in
where nothing was stolen?

32:55.499 --> 32:57.033
Ping pong balls, wax, gas.

32:57.068 --> 32:59.169
You guys, it makes perfect sense.

32:59.203 --> 33:00.503
He fixed the lottery.

33:11.222 --> 33:13.476
It wasn't a heist. It was an exchange.

33:13.508 --> 33:15.443
They replaced the official lotto balls

33:15.477 --> 33:16.644
with the doctored ones,

33:16.678 --> 33:18.913
which is why no one knew
anything was missing.

33:18.948 --> 33:20.815
They must've filled <i>their</i> lottery balls

33:20.850 --> 33:23.384
with argon gas,
sealing the hole with wax.

33:23.418 --> 33:26.221
Under the hot lights of the TV studio,

33:26.255 --> 33:27.956
the argon would make
the balls expand enough,

33:27.990 --> 33:29.190
they wouldn't go in the chute.

33:29.224 --> 33:30.524
They would just bounce off.

33:30.559 --> 33:32.226
So only the balls without gas
can fit through 'em.

33:32.261 --> 33:33.827
Yeah, they must've been doing tests,

33:33.862 --> 33:35.829
exposing the gas-filled balls
to heat sources,

33:35.864 --> 33:38.165
and gotten them too close,
and celluloid is flammable...

33:38.199 --> 33:40.534
- That's how the fire started.
- It all fits.

33:40.569 --> 33:42.503
And there's one sure way to prove it.

33:42.537 --> 33:45.906
- 17...
- No.

33:45.940 --> 33:47.241
- 37...
- No, no.

33:47.275 --> 33:50.510
- No, this is impossible.
- And yet...

33:50.544 --> 33:52.412
You don't understand. This can't happen.

33:52.446 --> 33:55.482
The balls are hand-delivered
and locked in sealed briefcases

33:55.516 --> 33:56.850
by the lottery commission.

33:56.885 --> 33:58.318
They're placed in a safe

33:58.352 --> 33:59.552
that only two people have access to.

33:59.587 --> 34:00.821
And what happens to the case

34:00.855 --> 34:02.756
between the safe and the studio?

34:02.790 --> 34:04.758
One briefcase is chosen at random,

34:04.792 --> 34:09.161
between nine identical cases
just before the drawing.

34:09.196 --> 34:10.996
The balls are then
removed from the case,

34:11.031 --> 34:12.864
weighed, measured, and then placed

34:12.900 --> 34:14.301
inside the machine by people
wearing rubber gloves.

34:14.335 --> 34:17.771
Making this...
a statistical impossibility.

34:17.804 --> 34:21.040
- The odds against this happening are like...
- Winning the lottery?

34:21.074 --> 34:23.775
The case that they
had with them at the time

34:23.811 --> 34:26.578
was only large enough
to fit one set of balls.

34:26.612 --> 34:28.246
You said that they set that you used

34:28.282 --> 34:30.882
was chosen at random.
Who makes that choice?

34:30.918 --> 34:33.018
Our lottery announcer, Miranda Vail.

34:33.053 --> 34:35.721
But she's been with us for ten years.

34:35.755 --> 34:37.523
She would never do something like that.

34:37.556 --> 34:39.224
Does she have any children?

34:39.257 --> 34:41.527
Yeah, a baby boy.

34:41.561 --> 34:43.094
How old?

34:43.129 --> 34:44.896
Maybe 3 months.

34:44.931 --> 34:48.033
- Where is she right now? - She said
she wasn't feeling well. She just left.

34:48.067 --> 34:49.635
Okay, you stay here. That's evidence.

34:49.668 --> 34:51.235
Watch those balls.

34:52.670 --> 34:54.505
No. Not touching it.

34:58.911 --> 35:00.078
Miranda!

35:02.348 --> 35:03.648
Miranda Vail!

35:03.682 --> 35:04.782
I'm sorry. I'm in a hurry.

35:04.817 --> 35:06.284
Please, just wait. We need to talk.

35:06.319 --> 35:08.279
- No, I can't, please. I'm sorry.
- We have your baby.

35:11.022 --> 35:12.323
You have him.

35:12.358 --> 35:13.391
Yes.

35:13.425 --> 35:14.625
- You have Benny?
- Yes.

35:14.660 --> 35:16.494
Oh, my God. Where is he? Is he okay?

35:16.528 --> 35:18.563
- He's safe. He's...
- What about my husband?

35:18.597 --> 35:21.031
Paul, they have him, too.

35:23.542 --> 35:26.370
They called me three days ago.

35:26.404 --> 35:27.671
Who?

35:27.705 --> 35:29.073
A man.

35:29.107 --> 35:33.110
He said they were holding
Paul, my husband, and Benny,

35:33.144 --> 35:34.745
and that if I went to the police

35:34.779 --> 35:37.281
or said anything to anyone,
he would kill them both.

35:37.315 --> 35:39.116
And did you recognize his voice?

35:39.150 --> 35:40.117
It was disguised.

35:40.151 --> 35:41.818
He told me that if I wanted

35:41.853 --> 35:45.088
to see my family again,
I had to do exactly as he said.

35:45.122 --> 35:46.456
And what did he tell you to do?

35:46.491 --> 35:47.758
He said it was easy.

35:47.792 --> 35:50.226
All I had to do was pick
the right set of balls.

35:50.261 --> 35:52.429
He would call me
the morning of the lottery

35:52.463 --> 35:53.597
and tell me which one.

35:53.631 --> 35:54.798
Did he?

35:54.832 --> 35:56.433
Yesterday, at 5:00 A.M.,
he told me to pick

35:56.467 --> 35:58.334
the third briefcase from the left,

35:58.369 --> 35:59.468
and that if his numbers didn't come up,

35:59.503 --> 36:01.637
that I would be sorry.

36:01.671 --> 36:03.672
Did you hear anything else?

36:03.707 --> 36:05.341
Anything in the background?

36:05.376 --> 36:09.012
No.
All I heard was Benny crying.

36:09.046 --> 36:11.014
When do I get to see him? Is he here?

36:11.048 --> 36:12.949
He's on his way in right now.

36:12.983 --> 36:14.383
One thing I... I still don't get.

36:14.418 --> 36:17.252
When they came forward
to collect their winnings,

36:17.287 --> 36:18.447
you would know who they were.

36:18.455 --> 36:19.789
How did they plan
on getting away with it?

36:19.823 --> 36:21.590
They were going to hold Paul and Benny

36:21.625 --> 36:23.325
another couple of days,

36:23.359 --> 36:24.660
until they could collect their winnings.

36:24.694 --> 36:26.462
Once they moved the money
out of the country,

36:26.496 --> 36:28.130
they were going to release them.

36:28.164 --> 36:29.331
But now...

36:29.365 --> 36:33.101
do you think you can find him?

36:34.904 --> 36:37.439
If Paul's still
a hostage, he won't be for long.

36:37.473 --> 36:39.174
Whatever happened that night
with his captors,

36:39.208 --> 36:40.909
their plan is blown.

36:40.944 --> 36:41.977
Not necessarily.

36:42.011 --> 36:43.778
We checked with lottery officials.

36:43.813 --> 36:45.981
A second ticket
with the exact same numbers

36:46.015 --> 36:47.048
was sold in the City

36:47.082 --> 36:49.183
just hours after
Cameron's body was found.

36:49.217 --> 36:50.284
A replacement ticket.

36:50.319 --> 36:52.454
They might not know
we made the connection

36:52.488 --> 36:53.621
to the lottery.

36:53.656 --> 36:54.856
After all, Miranda did as she was asked.

36:54.890 --> 36:57.091
So they may still come forward.

36:57.125 --> 36:59.461
What if they decide that it's too risky?

36:59.495 --> 37:02.897
What if they discover that we know?

37:02.932 --> 37:05.933
Then Paul Vail will be
nothing but a liability,

37:05.968 --> 37:08.202
and they will kill him.

37:08.236 --> 37:10.838
Then we need to find him
before that happens.

37:20.611 --> 37:22.556
C.S.U.'s going over Cam's car again,

37:22.587 --> 37:24.814
see if his partners left
any trace evidence.

37:24.853 --> 37:26.254
But it's gonna take time.

37:26.288 --> 37:27.743
Time is one thing we don't have.

37:27.783 --> 37:29.517
And we're facing an uphill battle.

37:29.552 --> 37:31.452
Whoever these guys are,
they must've been damn good

37:31.487 --> 37:33.821
to get past that building's
security undetected.

37:33.855 --> 37:36.090
Wait. What if they didn't?

37:36.124 --> 37:37.158
What do you mean?

37:37.192 --> 37:39.060
We already know they have one person

37:39.094 --> 37:41.328
working on the inside
of the Colfax building...

37:41.362 --> 37:43.164
Miranda, but what if they have two?

37:43.198 --> 37:45.332
They would've needed someone
to help them circumvent

37:45.366 --> 37:47.601
the building's security system,
avoid the camera,

37:47.635 --> 37:48.936
and rewrite all the logs.

37:48.970 --> 37:51.271
The only person capable
of doing that undetected...

37:51.306 --> 37:52.706
Is the head of security.

37:52.740 --> 37:54.608
He works in the building.
We spoke to him.

37:54.642 --> 37:56.310
We may have already tipped our hand.

37:56.344 --> 37:58.412
Not if he's being leveraged, too.

37:58.446 --> 38:00.146
What do we know about him?

38:00.181 --> 38:03.483
Walter Dennis.
Guy's an ex-cop from Albany.

38:03.518 --> 38:06.219
Any family, spouse, or children
they can use against him?

38:06.253 --> 38:07.653
No, guy's divorced. No kids.

38:07.688 --> 38:09.222
Listen to this. Dennis got fired from

38:09.256 --> 38:11.656
the Albany Police Department
ten years ago for taking bribes.

38:11.658 --> 38:13.426
- He's dirty.
- They're not leveraging him.

38:13.460 --> 38:14.828
He's in on it.

38:14.862 --> 38:17.831
If he's in on it,
then he knows we're onto him.

38:17.865 --> 38:19.365
He would've seen us taking Miranda.

38:19.399 --> 38:21.534
They can't come forward now.
They're gonna kill Paul.

38:24.304 --> 38:27.306
Dennis isn't at work.
He left right after we did.

38:27.341 --> 38:29.174
He's not at his apartment either.

38:29.209 --> 38:31.644
- No, he's wherever Paul is.
- Hey, check this out.

38:31.678 --> 38:33.412
I found a series of calls
between Walter Dennis

38:33.447 --> 38:34.480
and Roman's limo service.

38:34.514 --> 38:35.881
Where Cameron worked.

38:35.915 --> 38:38.016
Dennis called there six times.

38:38.051 --> 38:39.317
Probably to plan the job.

38:39.352 --> 38:40.452
Only they weren't to Cam.

38:40.486 --> 38:42.154
These were made in the last two days.

38:42.188 --> 38:43.455
After Cam was already dead, so...

38:43.489 --> 38:44.556
Who was he calling?

38:49.262 --> 38:50.729
Come on. Let's go. It's clear.

38:52.474 --> 38:54.032
Come on. Let's get him.

38:54.067 --> 38:55.667
Come on, Vail.

38:55.701 --> 38:56.968
Time's up.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.112
Come on. Get him in.

39:08.147 --> 39:10.448
Come on, get him in there.

39:10.483 --> 39:12.416
Get him in, get him in the truck.

39:12.450 --> 39:15.753
Get him in.

39:16.492 --> 39:20.258
Sorry, pal. The way things
stand, we got no other choice.

39:20.292 --> 39:22.059
I think you do.

39:28.400 --> 39:29.767
Come on, on your knees.

39:41.646 --> 39:43.480
I never thought I'd see you again.

39:43.515 --> 39:45.715
Paul.

39:45.749 --> 39:46.783
Where's Benny?

39:46.818 --> 39:49.019
He's on his way up now.

39:50.521 --> 39:51.754
Nicely done.

39:51.789 --> 39:54.757
Thanks, but, uh,
Cam is the real hero here.

39:54.792 --> 39:56.126
The getaway driver?

39:56.160 --> 39:59.029
Yeah, turns out it was
a case of "honor among thieves."

39:59.063 --> 40:01.064
Yeah, Paul told us the whole story.

40:01.098 --> 40:03.466
When Cam's boss, Roman,
found out about his past,

40:03.500 --> 40:04.967
he pressured Cam into the job

40:05.001 --> 40:07.136
and threatened to fire him
if he didn't go along.

40:07.170 --> 40:08.371
He was gonna destroy everything

40:08.405 --> 40:09.439
he and his wife were trying to build.

40:09.473 --> 40:11.073
Roman promised no one would get hurt,

40:11.107 --> 40:13.142
but then after the ball exchange
at the TV station,

40:13.176 --> 40:15.211
Cam overheard Roman
and Walter Dennis talking.

40:15.245 --> 40:17.179
That whole leaving
the country thing was bull.

40:17.214 --> 40:19.448
They never had any intention
of letting the Vails live.

40:19.482 --> 40:21.083
Yeah, before collecting the winnings,

40:21.117 --> 40:23.252
they were gonna stage
an accident, killing 'em all.

40:23.286 --> 40:26.255
Silencing the only witnesses
to their crime.

40:26.289 --> 40:27.789
When Cam found out,
he couldn't live with it.

40:27.824 --> 40:30.525
He tried to save us both.
But they caught him.

40:30.560 --> 40:32.328
So he grabbed Benny and ran.

40:32.362 --> 40:34.163
He gave up his life for us.

40:35.798 --> 40:37.699
Look who's here.

40:37.734 --> 40:38.967
Benny. Oh, my God.

40:40.536 --> 40:43.171
My grandmother got him some new clothes.

40:43.205 --> 40:46.608
Hey, buddy. Hey.

40:48.244 --> 40:49.578
Oh, my God.

40:54.149 --> 40:55.649
Well, the good news is...

40:55.684 --> 40:57.352
I mean, besides saving that family...

40:57.386 --> 40:59.620
they are rolling over the lottery.

40:59.654 --> 41:01.856
So I got another shot
at that $247 million.

41:01.891 --> 41:04.325
All I gotta do is tape
my tickets back together.

41:04.360 --> 41:05.459
Oh, dude.

41:05.494 --> 41:07.161
They, uh...

41:07.196 --> 41:09.930
they already took out the trash, so...

41:14.436 --> 41:16.737
I'm just gonna let him
swim around the dumpster

41:16.772 --> 41:18.506
for like an hour,
then I'm gonna pull him out.

41:18.540 --> 41:20.474
Happy Thanksgiving.

41:20.509 --> 41:21.742
Yeah, you, too.

41:21.777 --> 41:23.411
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

41:23.445 --> 41:27.314
You know, I... I think I'm actually
gonna miss little Benny.

41:27.348 --> 41:28.481
Well, who knows?

41:28.516 --> 41:29.917
Maybe in a few thanksgivings from now,

41:29.951 --> 41:33.253
we'll have a couple Bennys
of our own running around.

41:33.288 --> 41:35.956
Hey, if you guys
have kids in a few years,

41:35.990 --> 41:37.230
and I have kids in a few years,

41:37.258 --> 41:38.625
they can grow up together.

41:39.727 --> 41:41.861
And it's ruined.

41:41.896 --> 41:43.506
And the Turkey will be, too,
if I don't get it

41:43.533 --> 41:45.434
out of the freezer.
Come on, ladies. Chop, chop.

41:46.366 --> 41:47.967
There we go.

41:48.001 --> 41:51.671
- Ooh.
- Oh, this is so exciting.

41:51.705 --> 41:54.507
Our family is just growing
by leaps and bounds.

41:54.542 --> 41:56.409
If we keep this up, darling,

41:56.444 --> 41:57.476
we're gonna need a bigger table.

41:57.510 --> 42:00.779
Exactly 20 minutes till turkey time.

42:00.814 --> 42:02.214
Pi is on his way,

42:02.249 --> 42:04.050
and Beckett's dad just called.
He'll be here any minute.

42:04.084 --> 42:05.617
Excellent. And where's Beckett?

42:09.923 --> 42:11.357
Katherine.

42:11.391 --> 42:14.626
What on earth are you wearing?

42:14.661 --> 42:15.861
My... outfit.

42:15.895 --> 42:18.396
Your family... tradition.

42:18.431 --> 42:21.600
Yeah, uh, you do know I was kidding...

42:21.634 --> 42:22.901
about that, right?

42:22.936 --> 42:26.438
You know, I actually
wasn't sure about that.

42:26.473 --> 42:30.175
So I figured, if this isn't
a Castle family tradition,

42:30.209 --> 42:31.876
then maybe it should be.

42:33.279 --> 42:36.214
Better put this on, pilgrim.
