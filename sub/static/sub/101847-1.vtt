04:26.000 --> 04:28.401
The
holidays bring back memories.

04:29.604 --> 04:31.939
Those moments we
shared with loved ones.

04:33.875 --> 04:35.176
Love transcends.

04:37.044 --> 04:39.046
I think you have
the right to be afraid.

04:40.181 --> 04:41.249
Love is terrifying.

04:42.950 --> 04:43.985
When we love someone,

04:44.018 --> 04:45.653
we give them a
part of your soul.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.355
And you don't get it back.

04:49.991 --> 04:52.359
Just because some silly
person smiled at you

04:52.392 --> 04:53.360
just the right way.

04:54.996 --> 04:55.997
Or kiss you.

06:04.332 --> 06:05.633
When I
was at her house,

06:05.666 --> 06:08.169
diagnosed with a
emetophobia and philophobia,

06:08.202 --> 06:11.138
do you know what those are?

06:11.172 --> 06:15.676
Emetophobia is the fear
of losing someone you love

06:15.710 --> 06:19.479
and philophobia is the
fear of falling in love

06:19.513 --> 06:20.948
or being loved.

06:23.517 --> 06:26.187
I've always had
this fear of death.

06:30.490 --> 06:32.326
When I lost my mother,

06:34.394 --> 06:37.565
I never had the
chance to say goodbye.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.935
And it made me realize that

06:44.538 --> 06:46.073
you take people for granted,
you know.

06:46.107 --> 06:48.843
We're just always
looking to the future.

06:48.876 --> 06:52.713
But we don't even know if
they're gonna be there tomorrow.

08:18.432 --> 08:19.333
Where's Alina at?

08:19.367 --> 08:20.801
Has anybody seen Alina?

08:20.835 --> 08:22.269
Come on, come on, get close.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.373
Everybody smile, there you go.

08:25.406 --> 08:27.742
Nice, nice, great, great, great.

08:27.775 --> 08:28.976
Thank you.

08:29.010 --> 08:31.012
Ladies and gentlemen
please take your seats.

08:31.045 --> 08:33.848
The show is about to begin.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.836
Where did Alina and Victor go?

09:28.869 --> 09:29.804
Did they leave?

09:29.837 --> 09:30.671
I'm not sure.

09:32.039 --> 09:33.007
That reminds me.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.976
I need to confirm that
birthdaygram for Alina.

09:36.010 --> 09:38.045
Are you gonna
fire this guy today?

09:38.079 --> 09:40.581
Yes but not a word to
Victor about that, huh?

09:40.614 --> 09:41.615
Of course not, honey.

09:41.649 --> 09:43.552
Why would I say something
like that to Victor?

09:43.584 --> 09:44.452
I know you.

09:48.055 --> 09:49.490
I'm going to go
make that phone call.

09:49.524 --> 09:50.525
All right.

10:06.841 --> 10:07.908
Victor.

10:07.942 --> 10:09.511
Oh, Sofia, hi.

10:09.544 --> 10:11.245
We thought you and Alina left.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.581
We're about to go.

10:12.613 --> 10:13.881
Ah, is she okay?

10:13.914 --> 10:14.715
Yeah, she's fine.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.183
She should be right out.

10:16.217 --> 10:18.652
Walter told me about
that little surprise

10:18.686 --> 10:20.988
you got planned
for her.

10:21.021 --> 10:22.990
I think that's so sweet.

10:23.023 --> 10:23.858
Details.

10:25.359 --> 10:28.496
Okay, sure.

10:28.530 --> 10:29.363
Sure.

10:29.396 --> 10:32.466
By the way,
my lips are sealed.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.002
I hear nothing
and I see nothing.

10:35.903 --> 10:37.805
Thank you for that.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.840
Walter is on the
phone right now

10:39.874 --> 10:43.010
confirming your birthdaygram,
boy.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.279
This one is going to
be dressed as Santa.

10:46.581 --> 10:48.550
But you didn't
hear that from me.

10:48.583 --> 10:50.217
Thank you for letting me know.

10:50.251 --> 10:51.852
You know, between you and me,

10:51.886 --> 10:53.888
business has
been a little bit slow,

10:54.922 --> 10:58.225
and I got a feeling he's
going to let some people go.

10:58.259 --> 11:01.128
But you didn't hear that,
you didn't hear that from me.

11:01.162 --> 11:03.230
Keep that to
yourself.

11:03.264 --> 11:04.064
Of course.

11:04.098 --> 11:04.899
Okay.

11:04.932 --> 11:06.467
Well I better get in there cause

11:06.500 --> 11:08.936
I'm ready to pee in my panties,
so,

11:10.938 --> 11:12.206
if I don't see you,

11:12.239 --> 11:13.374
Oh, we are going,

11:13.407 --> 11:14.842
- now, yeah.
- Oh, okay.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.076
Well, happy holidays.

11:16.110 --> 11:19.713
And your secret's
safe with me from Alina.

11:19.747 --> 11:21.215
I appreciate your discretion.

11:21.248 --> 11:23.384
Of course, you know me?

11:23.417 --> 11:24.418
I'm a coffin.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.194
I still need to go by my
mom's place, is that okay?

11:33.227 --> 11:34.028
Yup.

11:34.061 --> 11:35.029
I got your mom coffee.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.030
Nice.

11:36.063 --> 11:37.731
Did you forget something?

11:37.765 --> 11:38.966
I think I
left some lights on

11:38.999 --> 11:40.768
before I came and met you, yeah.

11:42.336 --> 11:43.638
It's been vacant
for a while, hasn't it?

11:43.672 --> 11:45.739
Yeah, well kind of, I guess,

11:45.773 --> 11:48.042
I've been back and forth
with all the upkeep.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.846
Can you believe it's already
been almost two years?

11:53.914 --> 11:55.749
Time sure
does go by fast.

11:57.051 --> 11:58.219
This is the place
that she would always go

11:58.252 --> 12:01.021
whenever she just
wanted to escape it all.

12:01.055 --> 12:02.389
I remember when she would say,

12:02.423 --> 12:04.559
"Oh,
that was from your uncle Luigi"

12:06.727 --> 12:09.631
Did your dad sell Uncle
Luigi's property in Italy?

12:09.664 --> 12:10.831
No.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.032
And he's not
gonna if I still have

12:12.066 --> 12:13.067
any say in that.

12:14.068 --> 12:14.868
Someday were
going to retire there.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.538
We?

12:16.571 --> 12:17.572
Yeah.

12:17.606 --> 12:19.273
And enough space for both of us.

12:21.342 --> 12:22.843
Well, I hope
when you retire there,

12:22.876 --> 12:26.046
you grow old with
someone you love.

12:26.080 --> 12:28.048
'Cause you deserve it.

13:06.253 --> 13:08.822
Ho ho ho,
this is a birthday message

13:08.856 --> 13:11.058
from your friend, Victor Gardel.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.729
Tomorrow is your birthday,

13:14.763 --> 13:16.497
star light star, bright.

13:16.531 --> 13:18.799
Everything you do, you do right.

13:18.832 --> 13:21.335
You've shined your
light each every night.

13:21.368 --> 13:24.238
For that special smile,
I'll walk a mile.

13:25.873 --> 13:28.610
You know so well,
you are so swell.

13:29.577 --> 13:30.645
From all of your friends

13:30.679 --> 13:33.080
we look forward to more trends.

13:33.113 --> 13:36.050
Whether in fashion
or friendship,

13:36.083 --> 13:37.552
we'll always be friends.

13:45.826 --> 13:46.894
That was beautiful.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.664
I'm sorry,
it's probably upset you.

13:52.032 --> 13:53.167
No, I'm fine.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.769
Just, it's really beautiful.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.505
Well,
your friend wrote it.

13:57.539 --> 13:58.707
I'm just the messenger.

13:59.741 --> 14:01.041
Thank you.

14:01.075 --> 14:02.610
I thought you had forgotten.

14:03.944 --> 14:04.779
Love you too.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.649
Victor Gardel.

14:07.682 --> 14:08.916
Roy Bacchus.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.485
That was great,
thank you so much.

14:11.519 --> 14:13.387
Can I offer you
something to drink?

14:13.420 --> 14:16.156
No, I don't want
to interrupt anything.

14:16.190 --> 14:16.990
Nonsense, come on in.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.193
Yeah, please come in.

14:19.226 --> 14:21.128
I'm really
not supposed to.

14:21.161 --> 14:23.030
Come on, we don't bite.

14:28.202 --> 14:29.704
Alina Giselle.

14:29.738 --> 14:30.904
Giselle?

14:30.938 --> 14:32.172
That's a beautiful name.

14:34.843 --> 14:36.176
What are they gonna do, fire me?

14:43.718 --> 14:47.121
How about a vodka tonic?

14:47.154 --> 14:49.390
Sorry, we're hard drinkers here.

14:49.423 --> 14:50.558
Vodka tonic's great.

14:57.064 --> 14:57.866
Thank you again.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.667
That was everything I wanted.

14:59.701 --> 15:00.934
Happy to be of service.

15:02.236 --> 15:03.971
I'll put in a good word
at the agency for you.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.906
Oh, no need.

15:06.775 --> 15:07.609
Why is that?

15:08.710 --> 15:12.547
I got laid off today,
agency's cutting back.

15:12.580 --> 15:15.382
I would say I am
certifiably unemployed.

15:15.416 --> 15:17.719
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.

15:17.752 --> 15:18.887
It's not your fault.

15:22.423 --> 15:23.257
Thank you.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.060
Go and have a seat.

15:30.264 --> 15:34.067
Sorry, you gave me your
name and I forgot it.

15:34.101 --> 15:35.503
I know it starts with an R.

15:37.037 --> 15:37.872
Is it Roger?

15:39.273 --> 15:40.207
Roger Rabbit.

15:41.041 --> 15:44.579
Close,
but not quite.

15:44.612 --> 15:46.848
It's Roy, Roy Bacchus.

15:47.682 --> 15:50.250
That's an odd last name.

15:50.284 --> 15:51.920
Are you related to Dionysius?

15:53.387 --> 15:54.321
He's my cousin.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.726
Oh, so you come from a
long line of Greek gods.

15:58.760 --> 16:03.063
Some might say so, but
I'm of Roman descent.

16:03.096 --> 16:05.065
Dionysius was Greek.

16:05.098 --> 16:07.334
So the God of wine and Santa.

16:08.202 --> 16:09.036
That's me.

16:10.404 --> 16:13.006
Well I think you look
very cute in the outfit.

16:14.576 --> 16:15.877
So where are you from, Roy?

16:15.910 --> 16:18.378
Imported from Tower Hamlets.

16:18.412 --> 16:19.246
East side of London.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.648
Oh yeah, okay.

16:20.682 --> 16:22.182
Are you from there originally?

16:23.250 --> 16:25.954
Born but not raised.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.120
We moved around a lot.

16:27.154 --> 16:30.224
Mom didn't like to be tied down.

16:30.257 --> 16:31.726
I'm a child of the world.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.128
So interesting.

16:35.162 --> 16:36.330
What brought you here?

16:37.765 --> 16:38.600
Oh.

16:40.702 --> 16:42.336
Well I was visiting
with my girlfriend

16:42.369 --> 16:46.440
and she broke up with me,
left me here.

16:47.542 --> 16:50.244
I liked it so I figured
I'd stick around.

16:54.749 --> 16:55.583
Hmm.

17:05.560 --> 17:06.895
This is inappropriate.

17:06.928 --> 17:08.930
I really shouldn't be here,
I'm sorry.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.199
Don't go, it still early.

17:12.232 --> 17:13.868
I hope we didn't say
anything to offend you.

17:13.902 --> 17:16.236
No, not at all,
but I really should go.

17:38.826 --> 17:41.061
This is inappropriate?

17:41.094 --> 17:42.095
God, what a schmuck.

17:43.665 --> 17:46.034
How could I be
any more pathetic?

17:49.169 --> 17:50.838
He was cute, wasn't he?

17:50.872 --> 17:52.941
Yeah, he was.

17:55.577 --> 17:57.477
I should get going as well.

17:57.512 --> 17:58.713
Gotta get up early tomorrow.

17:58.746 --> 18:00.414
No, no, no, no, stay.

18:00.447 --> 18:01.883
Come on, let's hang out.

18:05.218 --> 18:06.020
You sure?

18:07.154 --> 18:07.989
Yeah.

18:11.325 --> 18:13.327
In that case I'll
walk you back there.

18:52.432 --> 18:53.433
Beautiful night out.

18:56.938 --> 18:58.138
Are you okay?

18:58.171 --> 18:59.306
Yeah, why?

18:59.339 --> 19:01.809
You're
just a little quiet.

19:01.843 --> 19:03.410
I'm fine.

19:08.181 --> 19:08.983
It was
nice hanging out

19:09.017 --> 19:10.183
with Walter and Sofia.

19:10.217 --> 19:11.218
Sofia?

19:11.251 --> 19:16.256
Okay, maybe
not Sofia.

20:15.616 --> 20:16.551
Shh, don't.

20:17.885 --> 20:18.786
Where am I?

20:18.820 --> 20:20.353
You're in my apartment.

20:20.387 --> 20:23.490
You had a birthdaygram for
my friend here earlier.

20:23.524 --> 20:24.525
Who did this to you?

20:26.226 --> 20:27.962
I'm gonna call the police.

20:27.995 --> 20:29.496
- No, don't.
- Why?

20:33.167 --> 20:34.035
Just don't.

20:34.068 --> 20:36.336
Let me take
you to the hospital.

20:36.369 --> 20:37.404
I'll be fine.

20:39.907 --> 20:41.709
I just need to go home.

20:41.743 --> 20:43.544
I don't think you're
going anywhere tonight.

20:45.012 --> 20:47.081
I'm not your responsibility.

20:47.115 --> 20:49.150
Look,
I know when people are hurt,

20:49.183 --> 20:50.718
and you my friend are hurt.

20:53.988 --> 20:54.856
You can stay here.

20:55.857 --> 20:57.491
If you feel better
tomorrow you can go then.

20:58.659 --> 20:59.994
I have to work,

21:00.027 --> 21:01.062
but you're more than
welcome to help yourself

21:01.095 --> 21:03.363
to anything in the fridge
or the cabinets, okay?

21:03.396 --> 21:04.966
Just get some rest.

21:04.999 --> 21:06.000
Thank you.

21:10.337 --> 21:11.172
It's Victor.

21:12.573 --> 21:13.406
Victor.

21:14.407 --> 21:15.243
Victor.

21:17.545 --> 21:19.379
I'll be out of here first
thing in the morning.

21:20.615 --> 21:23.251
Make sure to get better first,
okay?

22:03.157 --> 22:04.391
All right, let's see.

22:04.424 --> 22:05.960
Rhonda, Rhonda, Rhonda,

22:05.993 --> 22:09.530
how are you feeling today,
any better?

22:09.564 --> 22:13.034
Well, I'll get you up and
running soon, all right?

22:13.067 --> 22:14.235
Hang in there.

22:16.204 --> 22:18.606
And then there's Dollar, hey.

22:19.540 --> 22:20.373
You okay?

22:23.945 --> 22:25.546
Hey you, I'm sorry.

22:27.849 --> 22:28.683
All right.

22:33.888 --> 22:34.856
There, you're fine.

22:37.424 --> 22:42.530
Yeah,

22:42.563 --> 22:44.065
Now that's my dog.

22:47.201 --> 22:49.303
Well, very nice, didn't ya?

22:49.337 --> 22:50.671
All right.

22:50.705 --> 22:52.607
Cleaned up now,
you'll really suit up.

22:54.208 --> 22:55.810
Hey there, hi.

22:55.843 --> 22:56.677
I'm not sure yet.

22:59.680 --> 23:00.781
Pretty one, aren't ya?

23:04.318 --> 23:06.354
And my favorite, old Roscoe.

23:08.823 --> 23:11.058
Calm, be nice now with friends?

23:11.092 --> 23:11.926
All right.

23:29.210 --> 23:30.044
Hello?

23:31.679 --> 23:32.680
Okay, yeah.

23:33.714 --> 23:34.649
No, I'll be right in.

23:34.682 --> 23:36.483
I just need to stop
by the other apartment

23:36.517 --> 23:37.585
and check on things.

23:41.155 --> 23:41.989
What?

23:45.559 --> 23:46.394
How?

23:47.494 --> 23:48.896
I was just with her last night.

23:48.930 --> 23:49.864
She was doing so well.

23:49.897 --> 23:50.731
What happened?

24:00.207 --> 24:01.108
Yeah, okay.

24:03.010 --> 24:05.079
Okay I'll be ready, yeah.

24:05.947 --> 24:06.781
Bye.

25:55.022 --> 25:56.757
So what are you going to do?

25:57.925 --> 25:59.126
Wait till he wakes up.

25:59.160 --> 26:00.661
See what his plan is, I guess.

26:02.229 --> 26:03.532
You should take
him to a hospital.

26:03.564 --> 26:06.300
I mean, what if he has a
concussion or an internal bleeding?

26:06.333 --> 26:07.835
I know,
I offered to take him,

26:07.868 --> 26:09.837
but he refused to go.

26:09.870 --> 26:12.339
So he doesn't want
you to go to the cops

26:12.373 --> 26:14.108
and he won't go to the hospital.

26:16.077 --> 26:17.645
What is he, a criminal?

26:20.081 --> 26:22.583
Oh my gosh, what if you're
harboring a fugitive?

26:22.616 --> 26:24.185
Alina.

26:24.218 --> 26:26.487
I am not harboring a fugitive

26:26.521 --> 26:29.156
and you've obviously been
watching too much TV.

26:31.058 --> 26:34.161
Just promise
me you'll be careful.

26:35.029 --> 26:35.863
Please?

26:36.730 --> 26:37.566
I promise.

26:40.167 --> 26:43.003
Now tell me how's it going
with the fashion show?

26:43.037 --> 26:43.871
It's good.

26:43.904 --> 26:45.639
The sponsors are
still thinking about it,

26:45.673 --> 26:47.741
but they should be
getting back to me soon.

26:47.775 --> 26:48.876
Nice.

26:48.909 --> 26:50.077
You should come.

26:50.111 --> 26:54.516
That is unless Santa
doesn't murder you.

26:54.549 --> 26:57.718
No, I mean,
you know I want to.

26:58.719 --> 27:00.087
But I have to work.

27:01.523 --> 27:03.057
My critters, they need me.

27:03.090 --> 27:05.560
Victor, you work all the time.

27:05.594 --> 27:08.696
Is it going to kill you
to get one night off?

27:08.729 --> 27:09.730
It's not really about me.

27:09.763 --> 27:11.932
It's the animals, they need me.

27:13.934 --> 27:15.236
I don't know.

27:15.269 --> 27:16.403
Maybe, maybe it is for me.

27:16.437 --> 27:19.340
They make it so that I don't
think about my depression.

27:19.373 --> 27:23.010
You know that I'm giving
back, doing something good.

29:04.044 --> 29:05.145
From childhood,

29:05.179 --> 29:07.248
I remember walking around
to see the holiday lights.

29:08.382 --> 29:10.217
Every year I'd
walk the same path

29:10.251 --> 29:13.655
checking for any additional
fixtures or lack thereof,

29:13.688 --> 29:16.156
a tradition I enjoy
up to this day.

29:16.190 --> 29:17.891
No matter how trying life got,

29:17.925 --> 29:19.994
the holiday lights
always brought me joy,

29:20.027 --> 29:22.763
it gave me something
to look forward to.

29:52.560 --> 29:55.329
How long
have I been out?

29:58.032 --> 29:58.866
Two days.

30:00.834 --> 30:02.236
Two days?

30:02.269 --> 30:03.470
Yeah.

30:03.505 --> 30:05.272
You must have really
needed the sleep.

30:06.340 --> 30:07.174
How you feeling?

30:09.209 --> 30:10.612
Like I slept for two days.

30:11.845 --> 30:15.550
And like
I have a bruised rib.

30:19.654 --> 30:20.854
I'm sorry I put you out.

30:22.757 --> 30:23.591
It's okay.

30:25.059 --> 30:26.661
I've been meaning to try
out the couch anyways,

30:26.695 --> 30:27.696
It's not too bad.

30:35.269 --> 30:37.237
Well,
I should really get going.

30:38.606 --> 30:40.407
Thank you for helping me.

30:41.342 --> 30:43.110
The world needs
more people like you.

30:44.546 --> 30:45.513
So they do.

30:46.947 --> 30:48.349
Do you live nearby?

30:49.617 --> 30:50.618
No, not really.

30:53.320 --> 30:54.154
Wait.

30:55.356 --> 30:56.857
You don't have a place to go,
do you?

31:02.196 --> 31:03.030
How'd you know?

31:04.666 --> 31:06.333
You were talking
in your sleep.

31:09.937 --> 31:11.238
You can be honest with me.

31:12.906 --> 31:13.974
Why didn't you want
me to call the police

31:14.007 --> 31:16.076
or take you to the hospital?

31:16.110 --> 31:16.910
Are you a fugitive?

31:16.944 --> 31:18.847
No, nothing like that.

31:20.914 --> 31:21.783
So what is it?

31:23.050 --> 31:26.019
Feel free to pay me back with
just a little bit of honesty.

31:27.187 --> 31:28.857
You're right, I'm sorry.

31:28.889 --> 31:30.224
That's least that I can do.

31:32.059 --> 31:35.496
I came to visit and
I ended up staying.

31:35.530 --> 31:37.866
My visa ended about
four months ago.

31:39.400 --> 31:41.068
There's nothing
for me back home.

31:42.570 --> 31:44.037
So you're an undocumented.

31:45.906 --> 31:46.741
Yeah.

31:55.282 --> 31:57.050
Well, are you hungry?

31:59.888 --> 32:01.054
I could eat.

32:08.429 --> 32:10.330
I hope you like Chinese food.

32:10.364 --> 32:11.699
I eat everything.

32:19.072 --> 32:22.976
So don't you have parents
or friends who miss you?

32:23.010 --> 32:24.144
No.

32:24.178 --> 32:25.547
My mom died a few years ago.

32:26.380 --> 32:28.248
And my dad was never around.

32:28.282 --> 32:30.184
I never lived anywhere long
enough to make friends.

32:30.217 --> 32:32.953
So it was always just
me and my girlfriend.

32:32.986 --> 32:33.822
I'm sorry.

32:36.524 --> 32:37.926
And what happened
between you two?

32:39.527 --> 32:41.629
We wanted different things.

32:41.663 --> 32:45.199
I wanted to marry her and she
didn't want to be tied down.

32:46.366 --> 32:48.570
I guess that's why she's
a flight attendant.

32:52.907 --> 32:54.274
And how'd you get evicted?

32:56.076 --> 32:58.746
Well,
I found this place online

32:58.780 --> 33:00.715
that was willing
to rent me a room,

33:00.748 --> 33:05.385
but I ended up paying
both shares of the rent

33:06.588 --> 33:09.524
and it turns out she was
never even paying the rent.

33:10.925 --> 33:12.694
So, hence the eviction.

33:12.727 --> 33:13.561
Wow.

33:14.729 --> 33:16.997
You have really not
had the best week.

33:17.866 --> 33:19.032
I'm certainly not going
to buy a lottery ticket,

33:19.066 --> 33:20.033
that's for sure.

33:21.268 --> 33:23.370
I wish there was
something more that I can do.

33:23.403 --> 33:27.642
Listen, Victor,
I don't want your pity.

33:27.675 --> 33:29.644
I don't want your charity.

33:29.677 --> 33:32.379
You have been incredibly
generous with me.

33:33.380 --> 33:35.249
But I really think I should go.

33:37.117 --> 33:38.553
Where are you going to go?

33:40.889 --> 33:42.055
I mean,
this is not the city to be both

33:42.089 --> 33:43.423
penniless and homeless in.

33:45.025 --> 33:48.061
Look, why don't you stay
here for a couple of days?

33:48.095 --> 33:50.999
Let me call a few friends,
see if anyone can help out.

33:53.902 --> 33:56.403
In the meantime,
finish your dinner

33:56.436 --> 33:57.906
and open your fortune cookie.

34:17.525 --> 34:19.192
You know, I think,

34:20.528 --> 34:22.396
I think you've done enough,
really.

34:24.197 --> 34:26.534
I wouldn't want to
inconvenience you like that.

34:27.434 --> 34:29.403
Well,
you already have for two days.

34:29.436 --> 34:31.606
So the way I see it
now you kind of owe me.

34:32.540 --> 34:34.709
Come on, hang around.

34:34.742 --> 34:36.010
Let me see what I can do.

34:38.546 --> 34:39.614
Now what does it say?

34:40.949 --> 34:41.749
What, this?

34:41.783 --> 34:42.584
Yes, that.

34:42.617 --> 34:43.450
Nothing.

34:49.824 --> 34:50.658
Deep.

34:53.226 --> 34:55.362
Most of those things
say the same thing.

34:55.395 --> 34:56.531
Ah, don't be so sure.

34:57.599 --> 34:59.834
What, you actually
believe those things?

34:59.867 --> 35:02.737
Believe in a lot of things.

35:02.770 --> 35:03.738
Believing has helped
me throughout life.

35:03.771 --> 35:07.008
So yeah, I believe.

35:08.776 --> 35:10.845
What do you believe in?

35:10.878 --> 35:11.913
I believe in fate.

35:11.946 --> 35:13.413
I believe in destiny.

35:15.750 --> 35:16.551
What about you, Roy?

35:16.584 --> 35:17.919
Do you believe in anything?

35:20.253 --> 35:22.824
I believe that I'm here now.

35:24.726 --> 35:25.760
See, there you go.

35:26.928 --> 35:28.195
You believe in something.

35:31.566 --> 35:32.399
That's true.

35:34.936 --> 35:36.904
So tell me about your friend.

35:36.938 --> 35:38.338
Who, Alina?

35:38.372 --> 35:39.406
Yeah.

35:39.439 --> 35:40.273
What about her?

35:42.342 --> 35:43.645
Are you guys like a couple?

35:43.678 --> 35:45.245
No.

35:47.715 --> 35:48.549
Nothing like that.

35:48.583 --> 35:51.719
I mean,
we were lovers for about a day.

35:52.587 --> 35:53.988
But that did not work out.

35:55.523 --> 35:58.059
We talked and we realized
pretty quickly that we

35:59.093 --> 36:01.194
made much, much better friends.

36:02.997 --> 36:03.798
She's cute.

36:03.831 --> 36:05.265
Yeah, yeah she is.

36:07.835 --> 36:10.738
Now listen, I think that
you should stay here

36:10.772 --> 36:12.073
until you fully recover.

36:14.542 --> 36:17.177
I'm gonna make some calls,
let me see what I can do.

36:17.210 --> 36:18.680
With the economy the way it is,

36:18.713 --> 36:21.549
you really just should not be
out there wandering around.

36:24.886 --> 36:26.486
Well, I can't argue with that.

36:30.158 --> 36:32.527
I will repay you, seriously.

36:34.327 --> 36:36.329
How do
you intend to do that?

36:38.166 --> 36:41.468
I don't know.

36:41.501 --> 36:43.771
I could run some errands,

36:45.073 --> 36:46.107
clean your apartment.

36:48.009 --> 36:49.376
Well,
that is very kind of you,

36:49.409 --> 36:51.679
but I really rather
you didn't just 'cause

36:51.713 --> 36:53.181
I have everything in its place

36:53.213 --> 36:55.083
and I'm kind of
particular about that.

36:56.851 --> 36:57.685
But look.

36:59.654 --> 37:01.889
It's getting late, I
have a big day tomorrow.

37:03.591 --> 37:04.859
You should get some rest.

37:06.761 --> 37:08.328
Okay.

37:11.165 --> 37:13.500
Thank you, really.

37:15.603 --> 37:17.004
Yeah, of course.

37:43.831 --> 37:45.666
So what
are you gonna do?

37:45.700 --> 37:47.334
So he doesn't
wanna go to the cops

37:47.367 --> 37:50.171
and he won't go to the hospital.

37:50.204 --> 37:52.507
Oh my gosh, what if you're
harboring a fugitive?

37:54.075 --> 37:56.244
Thank
you for helping me.

37:56.276 --> 37:58.179
The world needs
more people like you.

37:59.714 --> 38:01.649
Well I am so sorry,
you're right,

38:01.682 --> 38:03.751
there's just nothing I can do.

38:03.785 --> 38:05.219
I'm undocumented.

38:07.522 --> 38:10.992
Don't you have
parents or friends who miss you?

38:12.325 --> 38:13.861
No, not really.

38:13.895 --> 38:16.396
My mother died a few years ago

38:17.598 --> 38:19.934
and my dad was never around.

39:33.541 --> 39:35.343
You cleaned.

39:35.375 --> 39:36.244
I didn't
have anything to do

39:36.277 --> 39:39.379
so I figure I'd put
my hands together.

39:42.884 --> 39:44.051
Hey.

39:44.085 --> 39:44.852
All right.

39:44.886 --> 39:45.686
You made breakfast.

39:45.720 --> 39:46.520
I made bakes.

39:46.554 --> 39:47.688
They're my own recipe.

39:49.557 --> 39:52.293
So Victor, I was thinking.

39:52.326 --> 39:53.961
So was I.

39:53.995 --> 39:55.997
But sorry, I interrupted you,
go ahead.

39:56.030 --> 39:57.365
No, please, you go ahead.

39:59.233 --> 40:00.067
Well.

40:01.102 --> 40:02.370
Go on, get it out with.

40:04.238 --> 40:06.641
I was thinking that
there might be a way

40:06.674 --> 40:09.977
for you to stay here legally

40:10.011 --> 40:12.146
without the risk of deportation.

40:12.179 --> 40:13.314
Okay.

40:13.347 --> 40:14.548
What have you got?

40:16.250 --> 40:19.787
Well, I was
thinking.

40:21.255 --> 40:22.089
Go on.

40:23.224 --> 40:28.029
I was thinking that civil
union is legal here now

40:28.696 --> 40:30.564
for people of the same gender.

40:30.598 --> 40:34.068
And if we were to get
married, then you could stay.

40:35.569 --> 40:36.404
Oh.

40:40.241 --> 40:42.043
- It's probably a stupid idea.
- Okay.

40:42.944 --> 40:43.844
I'm not like that.

40:46.380 --> 40:47.348
Food for thought.

40:49.083 --> 40:50.084
I was just thinking it today.

40:50.117 --> 40:52.386
It was probably a stupid idea.

40:55.690 --> 40:56.524
Sorry.

40:59.026 --> 41:00.661
Yeah, I can't think
about this right now.

41:00.695 --> 41:01.829
I'm sorry, I should go.

41:03.597 --> 41:04.832
Roy, no, Roy.

41:04.865 --> 41:05.733
I wasn't...

41:06.867 --> 41:08.402
No, Roy, I wasn't,

41:08.436 --> 41:09.437
trying to...

41:16.911 --> 41:17.745
Roy!

41:24.085 --> 41:25.519
Why'd I say that?

41:55.950 --> 41:56.784
So stupid.

46:31.425 --> 46:33.093
Espanol or Ingles?

46:34.361 --> 46:35.896
Ingles.

46:35.929 --> 46:36.765
Okay.

46:39.500 --> 46:41.969
So Mr. Victor Gardel,

46:42.002 --> 46:44.471
I see that you're a Zonian
from the Canal Zone.

46:44.506 --> 46:45.906
Yeah, that's right.

46:45.939 --> 46:46.741
That's right.

46:46.775 --> 46:48.208
I grew up there myself.

46:48.242 --> 46:49.910
Went to Balboa
High School actually.

46:49.943 --> 46:51.613
Oh you're kidding,
small world.

46:53.380 --> 46:55.215
Well,
I've reviewed your application

46:55.249 --> 46:56.817
and with the County clerk,

46:56.850 --> 46:59.086
I'll be issuing your
civil union certificate.

47:01.088 --> 47:02.489
You're here today
for the civil ceremony.

47:02.524 --> 47:04.793
And I must tell you
that there's many duties

47:04.825 --> 47:07.328
and responsibilities of a
civil union partnership.

47:09.029 --> 47:11.465
First I assume you're
both the legal age.

47:11.498 --> 47:12.900
Yes.

47:12.933 --> 47:14.968
And you're both here
of your own free will

47:15.002 --> 47:17.739
to engage in this civil union.

47:17.772 --> 47:19.206
Yeah, yeah.

47:19.239 --> 47:20.809
Yeah.

47:20.841 --> 47:22.176
Okay.

47:22.209 --> 47:23.745
You've met all the prerequisites

47:23.778 --> 47:25.079
for the celebration
of this union.

47:25.112 --> 47:28.082
So therefore the state has
decided to approve your request.

47:30.184 --> 47:31.720
Thank you.

47:31.753 --> 47:32.886
First I must ask,

47:32.920 --> 47:34.988
are there any objections
that either of you may have

47:35.022 --> 47:37.458
that might prevent
us from being able

47:37.491 --> 47:39.426
to continue with
these proceedings?

47:41.830 --> 47:43.130
No.

47:43.163 --> 47:44.264
Okay.

47:44.298 --> 47:47.901
Well, now's the time to speak
up if there is anything.

47:50.505 --> 47:52.574
Otherwise you'll be bound
by the amended resolution

47:52.607 --> 47:56.276
2-56 and the articles that
I'm about to read to you.

47:59.681 --> 48:03.217
Article 66 states that by
entering into this partnership,

48:03.250 --> 48:05.319
both of you understand that
you will share the same rights

48:05.352 --> 48:08.857
and responsibilities as
any other regular couple

48:08.889 --> 48:09.858
with your status.

48:11.826 --> 48:15.162
Article 67 states that
you both agree to respect

48:15.195 --> 48:17.498
and make this union work for
the benefit of both parties

48:17.532 --> 48:19.233
and in the interest
of your union.

48:21.168 --> 48:22.570
And that you will look
after each other's wellbeing

48:22.604 --> 48:26.039
and to protect each other
until the passing of one

48:26.073 --> 48:26.907
or the other.

48:29.343 --> 48:32.045
And finally, article 68 states
that by your own free will

48:32.079 --> 48:34.816
you have agreed to
enter into this union.

48:34.849 --> 48:36.350
You promise to be
faithful to one another,

48:36.383 --> 48:39.621
to share the responsibilities
of any ascendants

48:39.654 --> 48:41.021
or descendants in your care.

48:42.990 --> 48:45.058
And most importantly, to
look out for the wellbeing

48:45.092 --> 48:46.694
of your newly created family.

48:48.830 --> 48:49.997
Okay.

48:50.030 --> 48:53.967
So now we've reached the moment
for each of you to confirm

48:54.001 --> 48:55.369
your reason for being here.

48:57.938 --> 49:00.040
Mr. Victor Gardel,
do you agree to join

49:00.073 --> 49:02.409
into the civil union
with Mr. Roy Bacchus?

49:04.378 --> 49:05.212
I do.

49:06.681 --> 49:08.315
Mr. Roy Bacchus,

49:08.348 --> 49:10.417
do you agree to join
into this civil union

49:10.451 --> 49:12.352
with Mr. Victor Gardel?

49:18.927 --> 49:19.761
I do.

49:24.097 --> 49:25.399
Okay.

49:25.432 --> 49:27.769
Well, you may exchange rings.

49:45.653 --> 49:46.487
Great.

49:47.387 --> 49:50.324
Well, by the power vested in me,

49:50.357 --> 49:53.928
I now declare this civil
union to be legitimate by law.

49:55.095 --> 49:56.664
Congratulations to both of you.

49:57.932 --> 49:59.868
Oh and one final thing.

50:01.101 --> 50:03.705
I'll need each of
you to sign this

50:03.738 --> 50:07.575
notarized document
that will allow you to

50:07.609 --> 50:09.811
complete the process
of the certificate

50:09.844 --> 50:11.044
and this civil union.

50:24.057 --> 50:25.693
Congratulations.

50:25.727 --> 50:27.194
You may now kiss your spouse.

50:40.374 --> 50:41.576
Congratulations.

50:41.609 --> 50:43.277
Thank you so much.

51:07.869 --> 51:09.369
Home sweet home.

51:10.572 --> 51:12.172
This is so tight.

51:13.440 --> 51:15.175
I did not think that
you were gonna be able

51:15.208 --> 51:17.011
to keep a straight face.

51:17.045 --> 51:18.312
Yeah, I didn't either.

51:18.345 --> 51:19.413
We should celebrate.

51:21.081 --> 51:22.082
I don't have any champagne.

51:22.115 --> 51:23.751
I only get it for new year's.

51:23.785 --> 51:25.285
It's okay.

51:25.319 --> 51:27.622
We can celebrate with this.

51:27.655 --> 51:28.923
Whiskey, okay.

51:37.665 --> 51:39.399
To the new Mr. Gardel.

51:39.433 --> 51:42.169
Hey,
I did not give up my last name.

51:42.202 --> 51:43.203
Okay.

51:43.236 --> 51:45.172
How does it feel
to be Mr. Bacchus?

51:46.206 --> 51:47.341
Well, hold on.

51:47.374 --> 51:49.844
I did not decide on that either,
sir.

51:49.877 --> 51:50.778
Thank you.

51:50.812 --> 51:53.447
Fine, I will be
Mr. Gardel for tonight.

51:59.252 --> 52:01.488
I do really want to say

52:01.522 --> 52:04.759
how much I appreciate
what you've done for me.

52:05.660 --> 52:06.828
No, it's big.

52:06.861 --> 52:11.799
It's really big for
anybody to do for anyone.

52:11.833 --> 52:15.435
Especially somebody that
they just met a few days ago.

52:17.437 --> 52:20.575
What I'm trying to say
is that I'm grateful.

52:22.043 --> 52:24.779
And it says a lot about
who you are as a person.

52:27.615 --> 52:29.083
Who would that?

52:29.117 --> 52:29.951
Someone kind.

52:31.653 --> 52:36.256
Somebody generous, selfless.

52:39.027 --> 52:41.729
Well,
I would not have done this

52:41.763 --> 52:44.866
if I didn't think that you
were pretty special yourself.

52:47.234 --> 52:48.803
All right.

52:48.836 --> 52:50.571
May I have this dance?

52:50.605 --> 52:53.541
Now you're really making
me feel like Mr. Bacchus.

52:53.574 --> 52:55.143
Hey, it's only for one night.

52:55.175 --> 52:57.912
And besides, it's Christmas Eve.

52:57.945 --> 53:01.049
How many wedding nights do you
get to have on Christmas Eve?

53:02.050 --> 53:03.084
None.

53:03.117 --> 53:04.519
One wedding!

53:04.552 --> 53:05.385
One.

53:06.654 --> 53:07.889
So let's make it count.

53:22.436 --> 53:23.705
This is nice.

53:27.108 --> 53:28.109
Thank you.

53:29.043 --> 53:29.944
For what?

53:32.613 --> 53:34.048
For everything.

54:25.099 --> 54:27.501
Have you done this before?

54:27.535 --> 54:28.368
No.

54:30.004 --> 54:30.838
Have you?

54:32.073 --> 54:33.241
No.

54:39.113 --> 54:41.048
So what do we do now?

54:47.221 --> 54:49.690
Like, get some sleep.

54:52.059 --> 54:53.828
I have to work in the morning.

54:54.862 --> 54:56.363
On Christmas?

54:56.396 --> 54:59.066
Come on, it's our wedding night.

54:59.100 --> 55:00.467
We should hang.

55:00.500 --> 55:02.003
Shouldn't we go to sleep

55:02.036 --> 55:03.403
so Santa can bring our presents?

55:03.436 --> 55:04.238
If we're awake-

55:04.272 --> 55:05.206
- I am Santa.

55:07.041 --> 55:10.545
And Santa says
that we celebrate.

55:11.746 --> 55:13.514
We have celebrated.

55:15.249 --> 55:17.317
And this has been really fun,
but,

55:17.350 --> 55:18.586
we drank a lot.

55:20.988 --> 55:24.225
It's been a long day, I think
we should get some rest.

55:24.258 --> 55:25.092
Fine.

55:30.097 --> 55:31.933
You don't have to
sleep on the couch.

55:34.068 --> 55:36.838
Where are
you gonna sleep?

55:36.871 --> 55:38.438
We share the bed.

55:41.374 --> 55:43.744
You okay with that?

55:43.778 --> 55:46.413
What kind of spouse would I be

55:47.380 --> 55:52.385
if I let my husband sleep on
the couch on his wedding night?

56:16.376 --> 56:18.779
I had a great time tonight.

56:20.181 --> 56:21.015
Me too.

56:30.423 --> 56:31.491
I like you.

56:35.363 --> 56:36.197
I know.

56:56.951 --> 56:58.886
So what do we do now?

57:01.555 --> 57:02.823
I don't know.

57:04.926 --> 57:07.028
I don't want to hurt you.

57:09.163 --> 57:10.164
You won't.

57:13.768 --> 57:18.706
I don't want to do anything
that you don't want to.

57:18.739 --> 57:19.740
You won't.

59:04.178 --> 59:05.514
Are you awake?

59:06.515 --> 59:07.348
No.

59:14.655 --> 59:15.524
This feels good.

59:20.861 --> 59:21.996
Can we do this again?

59:26.233 --> 59:28.736
I don't want to lead you on.

59:29.603 --> 59:31.172
I did this for you.

59:38.012 --> 59:43.017
I know.

59:45.486 --> 59:47.522
I know you liked me like this.

59:47.556 --> 59:50.624
I just, I needed you to know

59:50.658 --> 59:53.194
that it's not always
going to be like this.

1:00:09.376 --> 1:00:10.611
I understand.

1:00:35.870 --> 1:00:37.705
I'm gonna take a bath.

1:02:44.265 --> 1:02:45.099
Victor.

1:03:00.414 --> 1:03:01.248
I'm sorry.

1:03:02.517 --> 1:03:03.917
I don't really know
what I'm doing.

1:03:09.390 --> 1:03:12.661
There's no need to apologize,
I mean.

1:03:13.894 --> 1:03:15.896
We had a deal and
we just had a little bit

1:03:15.929 --> 1:03:17.732
more fun than we had planned.

1:03:17.766 --> 1:03:18.832
It's not like that.

1:03:22.671 --> 1:03:23.571
Let's make a pact.

1:03:26.741 --> 1:03:28.543
What kind of a pact?

1:03:28.576 --> 1:03:30.779
If anything happens,

1:03:33.715 --> 1:03:36.116
no matter what happens,
we'll always be friends.

1:03:41.556 --> 1:03:42.657
You got it.

1:03:46.026 --> 1:03:47.061
Would you promise me something?

1:03:47.094 --> 1:03:47.928
Sure.

1:03:49.330 --> 1:03:51.365
Promise that if
anything ever happened

1:03:51.398 --> 1:03:52.232
to either one of us,

1:03:52.266 --> 1:03:53.768
that we would be
there for each other.

1:03:54.669 --> 1:03:56.470
Okay, done.

1:03:56.503 --> 1:03:57.905
Hold on, I'm not finished.

1:03:59.541 --> 1:04:02.276
I've always had
this fear of death.

1:04:03.944 --> 1:04:04.978
That's a little normal.

1:04:05.012 --> 1:04:06.581
Yeah, but this is for real.

1:04:06.614 --> 1:04:08.182
Okay, I'm sorry.

1:04:10.719 --> 1:04:12.787
When I lost my mother,

1:04:14.988 --> 1:04:17.024
I never had the
chance to say goodbye.

1:04:18.926 --> 1:04:20.695
And it made me realize that

1:04:24.766 --> 1:04:26.200
we take people for granted.

1:04:26.233 --> 1:04:29.069
We're just always
looking to the future.

1:04:29.103 --> 1:04:29.970
But we don't even know

1:04:30.003 --> 1:04:31.706
if they're going to
be there tomorrow.

1:04:36.076 --> 1:04:38.278
Well,
if it makes you feel any better,

1:04:39.179 --> 1:04:41.215
I don't plan on going
anywhere tomorrow.

1:04:50.357 --> 1:04:51.726
Would you promise
me one more thing?

1:04:51.760 --> 1:04:52.594
Yeah.

1:04:54.194 --> 1:04:57.231
If anything was
ever to happen to you,

1:04:57.264 --> 1:04:59.199
that you would give me

1:04:59.233 --> 1:05:01.235
some sort of sign or a
signal that just let me knew

1:05:01.268 --> 1:05:02.436
that you were around?

1:05:03.538 --> 1:05:05.507
And how would
you like me to do that?

1:05:05.540 --> 1:05:06.373
I don't know.

1:05:07.374 --> 1:05:09.844
Play with my keys, make
the lights flicker.

1:05:09.878 --> 1:05:12.913
I mean, just something, so
that I know you're there.

1:05:15.082 --> 1:05:17.886
I could email you,
how does that work?

1:05:17.918 --> 1:05:19.788
I'm being serious here.

1:05:19.821 --> 1:05:21.188
Okay.

1:05:21.221 --> 1:05:22.857
Yeah, the light flickering.

1:05:22.891 --> 1:05:24.358
That sounds good.

1:05:24.391 --> 1:05:26.728
And the keys, I'll do that too.

1:05:26.761 --> 1:05:29.196
I'll even put in a
little bit of my soul.

1:05:29.229 --> 1:05:30.698
So you know I'm always there.

1:05:32.834 --> 1:05:33.635
And would you look after me?

1:05:33.668 --> 1:05:34.669
Of course.

1:05:36.336 --> 1:05:38.372
Now let's stop
talking about death.

1:05:38.405 --> 1:05:39.339
Enjoy this moment.

1:05:40.909 --> 1:05:43.410
I am
enjoying this moment.

1:05:43.444 --> 1:05:45.045
Okay.

1:05:45.078 --> 1:05:46.514
I'm enjoying it very much.

1:05:56.056 --> 1:05:58.893
Listen,
I have to visit my father.

1:06:01.328 --> 1:06:03.330
Would you consider joining me?

1:06:03.363 --> 1:06:04.799
Yeah, where is he?

1:06:04.833 --> 1:06:06.233
He's at his office.

1:06:09.704 --> 1:06:11.104
How about breakfast first?

1:06:13.173 --> 1:06:14.107
That sounds good.

1:06:19.881 --> 1:06:22.216
Okay,
still a little too sticky.

1:06:22.249 --> 1:06:25.219
So we're going to get
a little bit of flour.

1:06:25.252 --> 1:06:26.788
Not a lot, just a little bit.

1:06:28.255 --> 1:06:29.289
Okay.

1:06:29.323 --> 1:06:31.425
You're looking for
the right consistency.

1:06:32.426 --> 1:06:33.728
Not a lot, just a little.

1:06:35.329 --> 1:06:38.499
You want it to be not
sticky, but not too dry.

1:06:38.533 --> 1:06:40.568
If it's too dry it
gets really crumbly.

1:06:40.602 --> 1:06:41.502
Okay.

1:06:41.536 --> 1:06:43.872
So once you got
the right consistency,

1:06:43.905 --> 1:06:45.707
that feels pretty good.

1:06:45.740 --> 1:06:47.509
We're going to ball that up.

1:06:47.542 --> 1:06:48.543
Just roll it?

1:06:48.576 --> 1:06:50.477
Yep,
just roll it just like that.

1:06:50.512 --> 1:06:51.679
Take that.

1:06:55.415 --> 1:06:57.184
Okay, now we're gonna roll it.

1:06:59.186 --> 1:07:00.487
Rolling, rolling, rolling.

1:07:01.723 --> 1:07:03.490
We're gonna flatten that out

1:07:03.525 --> 1:07:05.627
and make them
to like little disks.

1:07:05.660 --> 1:07:06.728
That's the bake.

1:07:06.761 --> 1:07:07.562
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1:07:07.595 --> 1:07:08.563
That's it?

1:07:08.596 --> 1:07:09.396
That's it.

1:07:09.429 --> 1:07:11.131
And then we toss it in there.

1:07:11.164 --> 1:07:12.767
Yeah,
just like a little frisbee.

1:07:13.935 --> 1:07:14.769
There you go.

1:07:20.107 --> 1:07:21.208
Oh, that isn't hard.

1:07:21.241 --> 1:07:22.042
No, it's super easy.

1:07:22.075 --> 1:07:22.911
Nice.

1:07:24.444 --> 1:07:25.580
Too thick in the middle?

1:07:25.613 --> 1:07:27.715
Ah, a little bit.

1:07:29.216 --> 1:07:30.885
There's another one.

1:07:32.020 --> 1:07:33.755
Thank you.

1:07:39.126 --> 1:07:40.028
It's pretty easy, right?

1:07:40.060 --> 1:07:40.895
Yeah.

1:07:55.743 --> 1:07:57.344
Last but not least.

1:08:04.552 --> 1:08:05.319
That's it?

1:08:05.352 --> 1:08:06.688
That's it.

1:08:06.721 --> 1:08:07.522
Pretty simple right?

1:08:07.555 --> 1:08:09.256
Yeah, and from there, okay.

1:08:10.825 --> 1:08:12.694
It's actually a
really weird flour.

1:08:16.764 --> 1:08:18.298
I think there's
something in the flour.

1:08:18.332 --> 1:08:19.366
What, no.

1:08:19.399 --> 1:08:22.135
Yeah.

1:08:23.437 --> 1:08:24.404
Seriously?

1:08:30.945 --> 1:08:33.081
Oh my god.

1:08:33.113 --> 1:08:34.214
No, no, yeah.

1:08:48.997 --> 1:08:50.364
I think I'm just
gonna wait here.

1:08:51.933 --> 1:08:53.868
Yeah, okay,
it's probably best.

1:08:55.069 --> 1:08:57.505
You okay?

1:08:57.538 --> 1:08:58.372
Yeah.

1:09:00.240 --> 1:09:01.743
But I don't want to do this.

1:09:02.777 --> 1:09:04.012
Relax, it'll be fine.

1:09:05.046 --> 1:09:06.279
I'll be here when you get back.

1:09:16.024 --> 1:09:18.158
What about
your lady friend?

1:09:18.191 --> 1:09:20.427
You have fine receivers
with any of them?

1:09:21.529 --> 1:09:23.731
No, nothing
really going on with that.

1:09:23.765 --> 1:09:25.800
I'm still really
close with Alina

1:09:25.833 --> 1:09:28.069
but nothing there.

1:09:29.003 --> 1:09:30.404
Nothing for now but,

1:09:30.437 --> 1:09:32.372
don't you have any
plan to get involved

1:09:32.406 --> 1:09:34.609
with some nice girl
in where you live?

1:09:35.843 --> 1:09:37.310
No plans right now.

1:09:37.344 --> 1:09:39.547
Just working a lot
and keeping busy

1:09:39.580 --> 1:09:43.718
and I'm spending a lot of
time with my good friend Roy.

1:09:43.751 --> 1:09:46.486
I remember
one time you told me

1:09:46.521 --> 1:09:50.525
you met a nice girl,
you were going out.

1:09:51.526 --> 1:09:52.994
What happened?

1:09:53.027 --> 1:09:55.730
Yeah I mean,
I've met lots of nice girls.

1:09:55.763 --> 1:09:58.700
It's just, you know, none
of it took, really wasn't.

1:09:58.733 --> 1:10:00.568
It wasn't that sort
of relationship.

1:10:00.601 --> 1:10:03.705
You know,
I need some grandsons.

1:10:03.738 --> 1:10:06.239
I am alone, I need grandsons.

1:10:07.407 --> 1:10:09.177
I depend on you on that.

1:10:09.209 --> 1:10:12.714
I don't know

1:10:12.747 --> 1:10:15.083
when that'll come about,
but you never know.

1:10:15.116 --> 1:10:17.585
Here, you go to a bar

1:10:17.618 --> 1:10:19.120
and you meet a very nice girl

1:10:19.153 --> 1:10:22.322
and bring me some good
news next time, okay?

1:10:22.355 --> 1:10:23.991
Well actually,
I mean,

1:10:24.025 --> 1:10:26.359
I do have some pretty good news.

1:10:27.829 --> 1:10:29.697
My friend Roy really
needed some help.

1:10:29.731 --> 1:10:32.232
But what, I don't understand.

1:10:32.265 --> 1:10:35.502
I want to hear from your
girlfriend, not your friend.

1:10:35.536 --> 1:10:36.336
You did what?!

1:10:36.369 --> 1:10:38.139
Are you out of your mind?

1:10:38.172 --> 1:10:40.240
Papa,
I did it to help a friend.

1:10:40.273 --> 1:10:41.843
Perdita had a son!

1:10:41.876 --> 1:10:42.677
Out!

1:10:42.710 --> 1:10:43.678
Get out!

1:10:43.711 --> 1:10:45.213
I want no part of this!

1:10:46.214 --> 1:10:47.882
Well,
Merry Christmas to you too!

1:10:47.915 --> 1:10:51.152
I can't believe you would
do something like that.

1:10:52.854 --> 1:10:55.223
Your mother would
be shamed of you.

1:11:21.448 --> 1:11:22.617
How'd it go?

1:11:25.853 --> 1:11:26.754
Not well.

1:11:30.992 --> 1:11:31.893
That bad?

1:11:35.163 --> 1:11:36.063
That bad.

1:11:41.434 --> 1:11:42.670
Tell you what.

1:11:42.703 --> 1:11:44.839
I have this special
spot that I always go

1:11:44.872 --> 1:11:46.473
when I get stressed.

1:11:46.507 --> 1:11:47.340
Let's go.

1:12:48.336 --> 1:12:50.338
Was he always like that?

1:12:51.205 --> 1:12:54.175
I've never seen
him like that before.

1:12:54.208 --> 1:12:55.843
All my fault?

1:12:55.877 --> 1:12:57.812
It is not your fault.

1:12:57.845 --> 1:12:59.580
Look,
this was a long time coming.

1:12:59.614 --> 1:13:00.648
He's always been like that,

1:13:00.681 --> 1:13:02.049
just so controlling.

1:13:03.718 --> 1:13:04.585
I'm tired of it.

1:13:04.619 --> 1:13:06.254
I'm my own man
and my own person.

1:13:10.490 --> 1:13:11.491
I'm a homewrecker.

1:13:13.393 --> 1:13:14.762
My mother would be so proud.

1:13:16.764 --> 1:13:18.299
Is there anything I can do?

1:13:18.332 --> 1:13:19.533
Maybe I can talk to him.

1:13:21.602 --> 1:13:22.737
Wouldn't do any good.

1:13:27.875 --> 1:13:29.543
Do you work for him?

1:13:29.577 --> 1:13:31.478
Sometimes, I mean, kind of.

1:13:31.512 --> 1:13:33.547
He manages my mother's estate

1:13:33.581 --> 1:13:36.584
and I co-manage different
assets and ventures with him.

1:13:38.119 --> 1:13:40.321
Alina is one of the ventures.

1:13:40.354 --> 1:13:44.325
But really, my joy, my passion,

1:13:44.358 --> 1:13:46.493
is my day job,
working with the rescues.

1:13:49.230 --> 1:13:50.064
I'm a rescue.

1:13:50.932 --> 1:13:51.866
Do I bring you joy?

1:13:53.935 --> 1:13:54.769
Yeah.

1:13:56.404 --> 1:13:57.238
Good.

1:13:59.941 --> 1:14:01.842
Good,
at least I'm good for something.

1:14:05.212 --> 1:14:06.547
So how do you manage Alina?

1:14:08.249 --> 1:14:09.283
Oh my God, Alina.

1:14:10.418 --> 1:14:11.852
I totally forgot we're
supposed to have dinner

1:14:11.886 --> 1:14:12.954
at her house tonight.

1:14:15.389 --> 1:14:16.657
Why didn't you say so earlier?

1:14:17.558 --> 1:14:19.060
Listen, I have a present.

1:14:19.093 --> 1:14:19.894
I have a bottle of wine.

1:14:19.927 --> 1:14:20.728
I can give you that to give

1:14:20.761 --> 1:14:21.963
so you don't show
up empty-handed.

1:14:21.996 --> 1:14:23.030
Okay.

1:14:23.064 --> 1:14:24.365
Yeah, it's okay?

1:14:24.398 --> 1:14:25.199
- Yeah.
- All right.

1:14:26.233 --> 1:14:27.168
Hello?

1:14:27.201 --> 1:14:28.536
Merry Christmas.

1:14:28.569 --> 1:14:29.904
Merry Christmas.

1:14:32.206 --> 1:14:33.307
Merry Christmas.

1:14:33.341 --> 1:14:34.141
Merry Christmas.

1:14:34.175 --> 1:14:35.643
I hope you like merlot.

1:14:35.676 --> 1:14:37.244
It's my favorite.

1:14:37.278 --> 1:14:38.112
Thank you.

1:14:39.380 --> 1:14:40.982
Please make yourselves at home.

1:14:41.015 --> 1:14:41.983
Thank you.

1:14:42.016 --> 1:14:43.718
I was just finishing
up here in the kitchen.

1:14:43.751 --> 1:14:45.853
So sorry, running a bit late.

1:14:45.886 --> 1:14:46.721
Oh, not at all.

1:14:46.754 --> 1:14:48.322
Totally the ones who were late.

1:14:48.356 --> 1:14:49.357
Nonsense, you actually gave me

1:14:49.390 --> 1:14:50.992
more time to prepare dinner.

1:14:51.025 --> 1:14:51.859
Perfect.

1:15:01.736 --> 1:15:04.772
So I'd never seen him
quite that angry before.

1:15:05.773 --> 1:15:06.607
Sounds awful.

1:15:07.908 --> 1:15:10.311
You guys had quite the day.

1:15:10.344 --> 1:15:12.079
Yeah well, you know him,

1:15:12.113 --> 1:15:13.547
I was never the
son that he wanted

1:15:13.581 --> 1:15:15.850
and now this is just
one more big reason why.

1:15:16.751 --> 1:15:19.453
Well your mother
would be proud

1:15:19.487 --> 1:15:22.056
of the man you've become.

1:15:22.089 --> 1:15:23.090
Thank you.

1:15:29.497 --> 1:15:33.067
All that matters is that
we're here together now.

1:15:38.172 --> 1:15:40.174
Victor, Merry Christmas.

1:15:41.175 --> 1:15:42.176
Thank you.

1:15:43.411 --> 1:15:45.679
And Roy, this is for you.

1:15:47.581 --> 1:15:48.582
Oh my god.

1:15:49.518 --> 1:15:52.720
I don't know what to say,
I didn't bring anything.

1:15:52.753 --> 1:15:54.523
It's okay,
you brought the wine,

1:15:54.555 --> 1:15:56.690
that's good enough.

1:15:56.724 --> 1:15:57.625
Yeah this is
sort of our thing.

1:15:57.658 --> 1:15:58.959
We both really love the holidays

1:15:58.993 --> 1:16:00.861
so we kind of go crazy.

1:16:02.430 --> 1:16:03.431
Thank you.

1:16:06.535 --> 1:16:09.203
Speaking of,
I think that you are

1:16:09.236 --> 1:16:11.405
really going to love that.

1:16:14.742 --> 1:16:15.576
And Roy.

1:16:17.512 --> 1:16:19.847
Roy, that is for you.

1:16:19.880 --> 1:16:20.714
Victor.

1:16:20.748 --> 1:16:23.184
It's nothing, just open it.

1:16:42.036 --> 1:16:44.905
Are these keys
to your apartment?

1:16:44.939 --> 1:16:47.641
Victor, I can't accept this.

1:16:47.675 --> 1:16:49.009
Yeah, you can.

1:16:57.351 --> 1:16:58.452
Now, open mine.

1:17:50.171 --> 1:17:50.971
You okay, Roy?

1:17:51.005 --> 1:17:51.839
What's wrong?

1:17:56.578 --> 1:17:58.445
When I was a little kid,

1:17:59.446 --> 1:18:00.848
I never got to
celebrate holidays.

1:18:02.750 --> 1:18:06.187
My mom always
struggled for work.

1:18:06.220 --> 1:18:08.489
I would always go
out and let her in,

1:18:08.523 --> 1:18:10.224
hope to find
presents and things.

1:18:13.327 --> 1:18:15.496
But it was always just me.

1:18:16.497 --> 1:18:20.234
This has always kind of
been a dream of mine.

1:18:29.076 --> 1:18:31.812
Well we are very blessed
to have you here with us

1:18:31.845 --> 1:18:33.515
this Christmas, Roy.

1:18:34.616 --> 1:18:35.650
Right, Alina?

1:18:35.684 --> 1:18:37.051
Yes, of course.

1:18:40.421 --> 1:18:41.488
Thank you for this.

1:18:43.090 --> 1:18:44.091
It's our pleasure.

1:18:46.661 --> 1:18:48.862
Can I use your bathroom?

1:18:48.896 --> 1:18:49.897
Of course.

1:18:50.764 --> 1:18:52.567
My home is your home.

1:18:52.601 --> 1:18:54.201
It's down the hall.

1:19:01.775 --> 1:19:03.310
He's so sweet.

1:19:03.344 --> 1:19:04.245
Isn't he?

1:19:06.113 --> 1:19:09.016
Listen, I wanted to ask you.

1:19:10.384 --> 1:19:12.052
He could really use some
work and I wondered if

1:19:12.086 --> 1:19:15.889
maybe there was some sort of
fit for him in the gallery.

1:19:19.793 --> 1:19:21.362
I'm sure I can find something.

1:19:21.395 --> 1:19:22.564
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1:19:22.597 --> 1:19:24.331
That means so
much to me, thank you.

1:19:24.365 --> 1:19:26.000
That'll be amazing.

1:19:26.033 --> 1:19:27.602
Anything for you.

1:19:28.769 --> 1:19:29.770
Thank you.

1:19:38.846 --> 1:19:39.681
Well.

1:19:42.517 --> 1:19:43.585
Welcome back.

1:19:45.853 --> 1:19:47.054
Feeling better?

1:19:47.087 --> 1:19:48.590
Much, thank you.

1:19:52.226 --> 1:19:54.962
You know, I could use
some help with the gallery

1:19:54.995 --> 1:19:56.997
in case you're looking
to make some extra cash.

1:19:57.031 --> 1:20:00.702
I'm producing the fashion show
there and I can use a hand.

1:20:01.770 --> 1:20:05.072
Doesn't pay much, but it'll
help you get back on your feet.

1:20:07.341 --> 1:20:08.876
I would love that, thank you.

1:20:09.744 --> 1:20:10.578
Welcome.

1:20:11.780 --> 1:20:13.748
Come back tomorrow
around nine a.m.?

1:20:15.082 --> 1:20:15.949
Yeah, great.

1:20:19.420 --> 1:20:22.189
Looks like it's
your lucky day.

1:20:23.857 --> 1:20:24.693
A toast.

1:20:25.694 --> 1:20:28.028
To new friends, old friends.

1:20:29.330 --> 1:20:30.964
May we all get
everything set to see.

1:20:32.701 --> 1:20:34.034
Cheers to all.

1:21:13.240 --> 1:21:15.844
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:21:15.876 --> 1:21:19.848
and now a visual
feast for your eyes.

1:21:19.880 --> 1:21:21.014
Escargot.

1:21:22.784 --> 1:21:27.020
We welcome you tonight
to a world of wonder,

1:21:27.888 --> 1:21:31.125
delivering a burst
of deliciousness

1:21:31.158 --> 1:21:33.293
- an uncommon taste of freedom.
- This is your moment.

1:21:33.327 --> 1:21:34.529
- As a body adapts
- You've got this.

1:21:34.562 --> 1:21:36.631
To the
consistency of fabrics.

1:21:36.664 --> 1:21:37.898
Shine.

1:21:37.931 --> 1:21:38.966
As they
brush against the body,

1:21:38.999 --> 1:21:42.469
Whoah.

1:21:59.687 --> 1:22:02.624
Coming straight
out of our solar system,

1:22:02.657 --> 1:22:05.325
Angelique shines in gold.

1:22:05.359 --> 1:22:07.729
A beam of light
straight out of the sun

1:22:07.762 --> 1:22:11.064
with infusions of
Greek goddess motifs

1:22:11.098 --> 1:22:14.334
demands attention and worship.

1:22:14.368 --> 1:22:15.737
Thank you, Angelique.

1:22:28.415 --> 1:22:30.984
From a world far, far away,

1:22:31.018 --> 1:22:33.187
Delilah is delighting
us with a confession

1:22:34.254 --> 1:22:36.858
straight from a spider's web.

1:22:36.891 --> 1:22:38.526
This Black Widow is fierce

1:22:39.527 --> 1:22:43.063
dressed in a single top
with a black feather veil

1:22:43.096 --> 1:22:46.433
in a sweeping
faint silk Saks skirt.

1:22:52.439 --> 1:22:56.009
Christina has blessed
us with her presence

1:22:56.043 --> 1:23:00.247
to accentuate her magnificent
exhibition as the Virgin.

1:23:01.950 --> 1:23:03.651
Olive Hundrow introduced us

1:23:03.685 --> 1:23:06.721
to a very unique perspective.

1:23:06.754 --> 1:23:10.357
This masculine delicacy
hides the essence of vigor

1:23:10.390 --> 1:23:11.992
that he brought.

1:23:12.025 --> 1:23:14.294
One who with the casual power

1:23:14.328 --> 1:23:17.565
is willing and able
to seduce any girl,

1:23:18.733 --> 1:23:20.535
sweeping them off their feet

1:23:20.568 --> 1:23:24.404
and turning them into
whatever his heart desires.

1:23:24.438 --> 1:23:26.406
Thank you, Alejandro.

1:23:26.440 --> 1:23:28.676
Franzua emerges from the depths

1:23:28.710 --> 1:23:30.377
with saturated colors,

1:23:30.410 --> 1:23:34.014
flowing with vast abstract
designs in his attire

1:23:34.047 --> 1:23:35.950
as our masked hero.

1:23:36.918 --> 1:23:39.186
Thank you, Franzua.

1:23:39.219 --> 1:23:42.289
From the book of Genesis,
our Adam sports

1:23:42.322 --> 1:23:46.326
emerald organic acids with
sparkling green beads,

1:23:46.360 --> 1:23:49.129
in an attempt to
hide his manhood

1:23:49.162 --> 1:23:52.399
from the ever increasing
powers of seduction.

1:23:52.432 --> 1:23:54.167
Thank you, as well.

1:23:54.201 --> 1:23:56.136
Please put your hands together

1:23:56.169 --> 1:23:57.906
and let's give a
round of applause

1:23:57.939 --> 1:23:59.841
to our magnificent models

1:23:59.874 --> 1:24:04.879
for all sporting the Escargot
fantasy collection from Saks.

1:24:05.445 --> 1:24:07.982
We take this
opportunity to remind you

1:24:08.016 --> 1:24:10.150
these confessions
will be on display

1:24:10.183 --> 1:24:11.886
for your viewing pleasure

1:24:11.920 --> 1:24:14.722
at the gallery during the week.

1:24:46.654 --> 1:24:49.156
Roy,
thank you so much for your help.

1:24:50.424 --> 1:24:51.693
You did it.

1:24:51.726 --> 1:24:53.327
Amazing and awesome.

1:24:53.360 --> 1:24:54.428
I really enjoyed it.

1:24:57.431 --> 1:24:58.432
Thank you.

1:25:00.400 --> 1:25:03.671
Would you like to
go out for a drink?

1:25:09.911 --> 1:25:11.579
I would like that.

1:30:39.941 --> 1:30:41.108
You're home.

1:30:42.043 --> 1:30:43.544
Yeah, I was waiting for you.

1:30:45.012 --> 1:30:47.715
Is everything all right?

1:30:47.748 --> 1:30:48.582
Yeah.

1:30:49.449 --> 1:30:51.052
Elena's setting up
for new year spread

1:30:51.085 --> 1:30:52.787
and I came to pick you up.

1:30:52.820 --> 1:30:54.288
Oh, right.

1:30:54.322 --> 1:30:56.190
Okay,
let me just take a quick shower.

1:30:57.191 --> 1:30:58.960
Actually, there is something

1:30:58.993 --> 1:31:01.395
that I need to
talk to you about.

1:31:01.429 --> 1:31:03.264
Okay, yeah, what's going on?

1:31:06.067 --> 1:31:08.269
I proposed to
Alina last night.

1:31:12.506 --> 1:31:13.341
She said yes.

1:31:22.516 --> 1:31:23.351
Oh.

1:31:33.493 --> 1:31:34.328
Congratulations.

1:31:35.396 --> 1:31:36.263
That's great news.

1:31:40.001 --> 1:31:43.604
No, no,
I'm really happy for you guys.

1:31:44.705 --> 1:31:45.539
That's excellent.

1:31:47.408 --> 1:31:49.176
Really happy for you.

1:31:52.913 --> 1:31:54.181
It's all thanks to you.

1:31:55.249 --> 1:31:56.450
You brought us together.

1:31:58.886 --> 1:32:00.755
Sounds like Cupid
was hard at work.

1:32:03.657 --> 1:32:04.992
Are you okay with this?

1:32:06.927 --> 1:32:08.229
Victor,
we'll still see each other.

1:32:08.262 --> 1:32:10.231
Maybe not as
often as we used to.

1:32:16.037 --> 1:32:17.304
I get it.

1:32:17.338 --> 1:32:19.607
I take it you'll be moving soon?

1:32:22.410 --> 1:32:25.546
Yeah, I'll be by to pick
up my stuff this week.

1:32:27.581 --> 1:32:28.549
I know it's sudden

1:32:28.582 --> 1:32:30.418
and we're obviously
gonna have to figure out

1:32:30.451 --> 1:32:31.552
the divorce paperwork.

1:32:35.689 --> 1:32:37.892
But that doesn't
matter right now.

1:32:39.026 --> 1:32:40.661
I can still come by

1:32:40.694 --> 1:32:42.997
and cook breakfast
every now and then.

1:32:43.030 --> 1:32:45.633
Nothing's going to change.

1:32:45.666 --> 1:32:47.668
I saw this day coming.

1:32:49.503 --> 1:32:51.072
Congratulations, really.

1:32:54.575 --> 1:32:56.210
I understand, congratulations.

1:32:58.045 --> 1:32:58.846
Come here.

1:32:58.879 --> 1:32:59.980
I'm fine.

1:33:00.014 --> 1:33:01.315
Stop.

1:33:01.348 --> 1:33:03.017
Stop, look at me.

1:33:06.887 --> 1:33:07.721
I love you.

1:33:11.025 --> 1:33:12.726
I will always love you.

1:33:15.429 --> 1:33:17.431
I will never forget
what you did for me.

1:33:19.767 --> 1:33:21.769
But Alina's my soul.

1:33:28.375 --> 1:33:29.210
I understand.

1:33:32.279 --> 1:33:33.582
I love Alina, I love you.

1:33:35.716 --> 1:33:36.884
And there's nothing
that makes me happier

1:33:36.917 --> 1:33:38.419
than knowing that two
of my favorite people

1:33:38.452 --> 1:33:40.454
are going to spend
their lives together.

1:33:43.357 --> 1:33:45.659
Part of me just still
wishes it was me.

1:33:49.330 --> 1:33:50.164
I know.

1:33:53.200 --> 1:33:54.034
I know.

1:33:57.037 --> 1:34:00.040
I didn't wanna drop
all this on you today.

1:34:00.074 --> 1:34:01.675
I just thought it was best.

1:34:04.579 --> 1:34:06.581
Yeah, it probably was.

1:34:09.216 --> 1:34:12.554
Why don't you go take
a shower and get ready?

1:34:12.587 --> 1:34:13.588
We don't want to be late.

1:34:14.755 --> 1:34:18.192
It was very thoughtful of
you guys to invite me over

1:34:18.225 --> 1:34:20.562
but I think I'm just
going to lay low tonight.

1:34:20.595 --> 1:34:21.862
I'm feeling really tired.

1:34:23.430 --> 1:34:24.265
Are you sure?

1:34:25.499 --> 1:34:26.400
Yeah.

1:34:26.433 --> 1:34:28.302
But you should go.

1:34:28.335 --> 1:34:30.171
You don't want to
keep Alina waiting.

1:34:32.273 --> 1:34:34.576
You will always have a
special place in my heart.

1:34:39.847 --> 1:34:41.215
It was fun, wasn't it?

1:34:42.750 --> 1:34:43.585
Yeah.

1:34:47.488 --> 1:34:48.489
Victor.

1:34:48.523 --> 1:34:50.592
May I kiss you goodbye?

1:35:00.669 --> 1:35:01.502
You should go.

1:35:03.737 --> 1:35:05.439
You are so worrying.

1:36:27.021 --> 1:36:28.956
I'm here because
your father asked me

1:36:28.989 --> 1:36:31.726
to speak with you about
something about this apartment.

1:36:32.926 --> 1:36:34.562
You have a few
interested buyers.

1:39:46.286 --> 1:39:47.120
Hello?

1:39:49.189 --> 1:39:50.023
Yeah.

1:39:53.494 --> 1:39:55.897
Sure, is everything all right?

1:39:58.098 --> 1:39:58.933
Right now?

1:40:01.268 --> 1:40:02.704
All right.

1:40:02.737 --> 1:40:04.606
Yeah, I'm on my way.

1:40:06.006 --> 1:40:08.710
Remember you told me
when you were a child,

1:40:08.743 --> 1:40:10.812
how much you loved Christmas

1:40:10.845 --> 1:40:13.313
and believed in Santa Claus,

1:40:13.347 --> 1:40:16.751
and how you refuse to
believe he didn't exist?

1:40:18.452 --> 1:40:21.021
How you would hide under
a dining room table,

1:40:21.054 --> 1:40:24.324
waiting for him
to eat the cookies

1:40:24.358 --> 1:40:26.928
and drink the milk you left
for him under the tree?

1:40:27.996 --> 1:40:32.165
And how you would fall
asleep under the table,

1:40:32.199 --> 1:40:33.066
waiting for him.

1:40:34.234 --> 1:40:35.335
And one night you
woke up to find your mom

1:40:35.369 --> 1:40:37.170
going back and
forth under the tree?

1:40:39.406 --> 1:40:40.407
Yeah, I remember,

1:40:41.543 --> 1:40:44.244
I thought that she was
checking to see what presents

1:40:44.278 --> 1:40:45.713
Santa had brought her.

1:40:52.887 --> 1:40:55.957
I always romanticize
your story in my head

1:40:57.324 --> 1:41:01.228
hoping one day I could
be the mom to that child,

1:41:03.397 --> 1:41:05.365
making sure he always believed

1:41:06.266 --> 1:41:07.869
even when the other
kids didn't anymore,

1:41:07.902 --> 1:41:11.005
because they had
outgrown that fairy tale.

1:41:12.339 --> 1:41:16.010
And when he was a grown man,

1:41:17.411 --> 1:41:20.380
he and his wife would
come home for the holidays

1:41:20.414 --> 1:41:23.651
to visit his aging parents.

1:41:23.685 --> 1:41:26.688
And I'd always be there

1:41:26.721 --> 1:41:28.056
to prepare the holiday spread

1:41:28.088 --> 1:41:29.824
that we used to
enjoy as a family.

1:41:38.666 --> 1:41:39.734
I remember.

1:41:41.536 --> 1:41:42.369
Victor.

1:41:48.776 --> 1:41:51.512
I no longer think that's
in the cards for Roy and I.

1:41:56.383 --> 1:41:57.919
What she's trying to say

1:41:58.786 --> 1:42:00.888
is that we've been
trying to have a baby,

1:42:02.724 --> 1:42:05.660
but we're having
difficulty conceiving.

1:42:07.394 --> 1:42:09.697
We've been to the
doctors and it's me.

1:42:13.333 --> 1:42:14.234
I can't have kids.

1:42:29.617 --> 1:42:32.587
Have you two
considered adoption?

1:42:33.921 --> 1:42:34.956
Maybe that is an option.

1:42:34.989 --> 1:42:38.225
I mean,
there are so many children who

1:42:39.426 --> 1:42:42.396
would love a wonderful
family like yours.

1:42:44.164 --> 1:42:44.999
We have.

1:42:47.334 --> 1:42:50.370
Victor, the reason that we
actually called you here

1:42:50.404 --> 1:42:53.574
is there was something
we wanted to ask you.

1:42:57.879 --> 1:42:58.680
Okay.

1:42:58.713 --> 1:43:00.280
We were wondering if,

1:43:04.085 --> 1:43:05.920
you would be our surrogate.

1:43:17.932 --> 1:43:19.433
You want me to donate sperm?

1:43:24.404 --> 1:43:29.409
Actually we want our baby
to be conceived naturally.

1:43:32.212 --> 1:43:34.082
We kind of had
something else in mind.

1:43:36.249 --> 1:43:39.721
We would like for you to
be part of the experience.

1:43:49.530 --> 1:43:52.166
Alina,
do you realize what your husband

1:43:52.200 --> 1:43:53.400
is asking me to do?

1:43:58.840 --> 1:44:01.341
Roy, I told you he
wouldn't go for this.

1:44:04.679 --> 1:44:07.682
Victor, let's just forget
this happened, okay?

1:44:09.617 --> 1:44:13.988
I mean it's our problem,
so we'll deal with it.

1:44:14.021 --> 1:44:14.856
It's my idea.

1:44:16.557 --> 1:44:19.193
I thought because you guys
have been intimate before

1:44:19.227 --> 1:44:22.764
that maybe it would be a
way to connect all of us.

1:44:43.684 --> 1:44:44.519
I mean,

1:44:46.687 --> 1:44:48.256
would you be present?

1:45:05.006 --> 1:45:05.840
I'll do it.

1:45:08.341 --> 1:45:09.409
Wait, really?

1:45:10.410 --> 1:45:11.245
Are you sure?

1:45:14.849 --> 1:45:15.750
Yeah, yeah.

1:45:19.587 --> 1:45:21.354
Would you like
to have a drink first?

1:45:24.058 --> 1:45:24.892
Wait, now?

1:45:28.729 --> 1:45:29.530
Oh.

1:45:30.898 --> 1:45:31.732
Then yes.

1:45:33.100 --> 1:45:34.101
Probably several.

1:45:39.574 --> 1:45:40.407
Okay.

1:46:32.260 --> 1:46:34.929
So how do we actually do this?

1:46:37.031 --> 1:46:39.166
This is awkward, isn't it?

1:46:39.200 --> 1:46:44.205
Yeah, a little bit.

1:46:45.239 --> 1:46:46.908
Like it still
doesn't wanna work.

1:46:46.941 --> 1:46:50.477
What can I do?

1:46:50.511 --> 1:46:55.516
More wine, yeah.

1:47:00.420 --> 1:47:02.723
Guys, this is crazy,

1:47:02.757 --> 1:47:07.094
are you sure that you
actually thought this through?

1:47:11.498 --> 1:47:12.499
Thank you.

1:47:21.042 --> 1:47:26.047
I'm here for you.

1:50:23.357 --> 1:50:25.359
I know they were
somewhere around here.

1:50:25.392 --> 1:50:27.361
They must've fallen
out of my pocket,

1:50:27.394 --> 1:50:29.897
Honey,
don't forget your bag.

1:50:29.930 --> 1:50:31.533
I'm going as quick as I can.

1:50:34.101 --> 1:50:34.969
Got it.

1:50:35.002 --> 1:50:36.871
Are you sure you're
going to be okay?

1:50:36.904 --> 1:50:37.705
Positive.

1:50:37.738 --> 1:50:38.706
Now go break a leg.

1:50:39.673 --> 1:50:40.509
I love you.

1:50:42.009 --> 1:50:42.910
I love you too.

1:50:47.781 --> 1:50:48.716
We'll be fine.

1:50:48.749 --> 1:50:49.783
Now, go.

1:51:45.239 --> 1:51:47.741
Hi, yes, please, I need
an ambulance right away.

1:52:01.855 --> 1:52:02.691
Hello?

1:52:03.692 --> 1:52:05.326
Hey, Roy.

1:52:05.359 --> 1:52:07.562
Whoa, whoa, whoah, slow
down, I can't understand you.

1:52:08.597 --> 1:52:10.231
I thought she was
due next month.

1:52:11.165 --> 1:52:11.999
Is it serious?

1:52:13.267 --> 1:52:15.369
What's the name of hospital?

1:52:15.402 --> 1:52:16.804
Okay, I'm on my way.

1:52:16.837 --> 1:52:17.738
I'll see you there.

1:52:17.771 --> 1:52:18.739
I'll see you there.

1:52:33.220 --> 1:52:34.455
Alina?

1:52:34.488 --> 1:52:35.956
Alina, Alina.

1:52:47.001 --> 1:52:48.135
Alina?

1:52:48.168 --> 1:52:49.638
- Alina?
- Alina?

1:55:08.175 --> 1:55:09.243
Oh, Victor.

1:55:10.077 --> 1:55:11.211
Victor, where are you?

1:55:12.346 --> 1:55:14.081
We need you, I need you.

1:55:15.115 --> 1:55:16.551
I can't do this without you.

1:55:48.850 --> 1:55:51.519
Oh baby.

1:55:51.553 --> 1:55:53.053
Please save my baby.

1:55:57.659 --> 1:55:58.827
Oh, my baby.

1:56:00.662 --> 1:56:03.731
Tell me he'll be okay, please.

1:56:03.765 --> 1:56:04.566
Please.

1:56:24.953 --> 1:56:26.220
Victor.

1:56:27.755 --> 1:56:28.790
Victor.

1:56:33.661 --> 1:56:34.495
Roy!

1:57:05.192 --> 1:57:06.961
Roy, Roy, Roy, Roy!

1:57:06.995 --> 1:57:08.897
Stay with me, it's me,
it's Victor, it's Victor.

1:57:08.930 --> 1:57:09.864
I'm here.

1:57:09.898 --> 1:57:12.634
Please, please, just
get some help, please!

1:57:12.667 --> 1:57:14.034
Roy, Roy,
help is on the way, okay?

1:57:14.067 --> 1:57:15.035
Stay with me.

1:57:23.778 --> 1:57:25.345
Somebody help me!

1:57:26.514 --> 1:57:28.181
No, no, no, no.

1:57:28.215 --> 1:57:31.251
No, no, no, no,
stay with me Roy.

1:57:31.285 --> 1:57:36.089
No, you stay with me,
you stay with me!

1:57:38.091 --> 1:57:38.927
No!

1:57:56.544 --> 1:57:59.346
Here I am
with the only man I ever loved

1:57:59.379 --> 1:58:00.347
crying over me.

1:58:01.950 --> 1:58:03.585
My soulmate waiting for us.

1:58:05.720 --> 1:58:06.754
And a kid on the way.

1:58:08.221 --> 1:58:09.557
Is this how it ends for me?

1:58:19.033 --> 1:58:21.301
Come on, come on, come on.

1:58:21.335 --> 1:58:22.737
Please, please.

1:58:30.845 --> 1:58:32.547
Just come on!

1:58:32.580 --> 1:58:33.413
Roy.

1:58:57.337 --> 1:59:02.342
Somebody get help!

1:59:11.919 --> 1:59:13.521
Let's make a pact.

1:59:13.554 --> 1:59:15.056
If anything happens.

1:59:15.089 --> 1:59:16.490
If something
were to happen to you

1:59:16.524 --> 1:59:20.662
and you would give me some
sort of sign or signal,

1:59:20.695 --> 1:59:21.495
just let me know.

1:59:21.529 --> 1:59:22.797
No matter what.

1:59:22.830 --> 1:59:24.999
We will always be friends.

2:00:10.011 --> 2:00:11.746
Thank you, I'm ready.

2:01:06.500 --> 2:01:11.505
Alina,

2:01:34.262 --> 2:01:35.663
Alina?

2:01:35.696 --> 2:01:37.364
Alina, Alina

2:01:37.397 --> 2:01:42.402
Alina,

2:01:42.770 --> 2:01:43.905
Alina?

2:01:43.938 --> 2:01:45.372
Alina?

2:01:45.405 --> 2:01:46.240
Alina!

2:04:23.230 --> 2:04:28.235
You and I are gonna get
through this together.
