WEBVTT

00:00.133 --> 00:03.600
You decided to make
some extra money breeding dogs.

00:03.667 --> 00:06.066
-Right.
-Did he give you any money?

00:06.133 --> 00:08.133
[upbeat music]

00:08.200 --> 00:09.266
No, no money.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.266
-That's a lie.
-How's that?

00:13.333 --> 00:14.967
-I mean, I'm not stupid but--
-If you're not stupid,

00:15.033 --> 00:16.934
don't play stupid
when it's convenient.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.934
[narrator]
This is Judy Justice.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.767
[upbeat music]

00:36.100 --> 00:40.934
[narrator] Danielle Nantz is suing
her former friend Darrel Bowens

00:41.000 --> 00:44.700
for the cost or the return
of a miniature Dachshund.

00:45.667 --> 00:47.433
[Kevin] Court, come to order.
All rise.

00:48.934 --> 00:51.066
Be seated, please. Kevin?

00:51.133 --> 00:52.066
[Kevin] Hello, Judge.

00:52.133 --> 00:54.066
Case 1087,
Nantz versus Bowens.

00:54.133 --> 00:55.300
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

00:55.367 --> 00:56.767
Miss Nantz,
what do you do for a living?

00:56.834 --> 00:59.600
I work for Amazon.
And I'm also a CNA part-time.

00:59.667 --> 01:00.834
What do you do for Amazon?

01:00.900 --> 01:02.300
I am a sortation associate.

01:02.367 --> 01:04.867
So, the packages
come in on trailers,

01:04.934 --> 01:06.333
and they leave
on the delivery trucks

01:06.400 --> 01:07.367
that you see
in your neighborhood.

01:07.433 --> 01:11.567
So, we sort them in between.
It's very physical. [laughs]

01:11.633 --> 01:13.834
I have to tell you,
that is some company,

01:13.900 --> 01:16.166
they certainly do know
how to deliver packages,

01:16.233 --> 01:20.066
and I get about 15 of them
a day [laughs],

01:20.133 --> 01:23.900
between my husband,
my grandchildren. [laughs]

01:23.967 --> 01:25.100
Not me, I don't--

01:25.166 --> 01:26.934
You know, if I want something,
I say to my husband,

01:27.000 --> 01:30.767
"This is what I want.
Can you order it for me?"

01:30.834 --> 01:33.600
Because I don't understand
putting it in a cart and

01:33.667 --> 01:34.867
checking off how many.

01:34.934 --> 01:37.100
Oh, okay,
you're not that person.

01:37.166 --> 01:38.700
I'm not that person.

01:38.767 --> 01:40.233
But in your spare time,
Miss Nantz,

01:40.300 --> 01:41.200
what you decided to do

01:41.266 --> 01:43.734
is to make some extra money
breeding dogs.

01:43.800 --> 01:45.133
-Right.
-[Judy] This kind of dog.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.266
Right.

01:46.333 --> 01:49.100
[Judy] And you knew Mr. Bowens
from where?

01:49.166 --> 01:50.633
He and I used to work
at the same company

01:50.700 --> 01:52.000
back in 2018.

01:52.066 --> 01:53.867
And at the time that you met,

01:53.934 --> 01:56.000
did you already have
this breed of dog?

01:56.066 --> 01:57.000
No, ma'am.

01:57.066 --> 01:58.000
[Judy] And did you have
this breed of dog?

01:58.066 --> 01:59.200
-[Danielle] I did.
-[Judy] One?

01:59.266 --> 02:01.467
I had one female,
one male in 2018.

02:01.533 --> 02:04.333
[Judy] So, you decided to sort
of go into business together?

02:04.400 --> 02:07.066
-Right.
-[Judy] And this kind of dog

02:07.133 --> 02:09.667
is called a Piebald Dachshund?

02:09.734 --> 02:12.967
Yes. An extreme Piebald
black and tan mini Dachshund.

02:13.033 --> 02:14.667
[Judy] When I read over
the complaint

02:14.734 --> 02:16.233
and the answer in this case,

02:16.300 --> 02:19.100
I must say that I had
never heard of that.

02:19.166 --> 02:22.967
And so I looked it up
on the Internet, Googled.

02:23.033 --> 02:25.867
[laughs] And-and
it showed this color,

02:25.934 --> 02:29.300
and I had seen this color
before--not usually,

02:29.367 --> 02:32.834
Dachshunds are usually
all brown or all one color.

02:32.900 --> 02:34.100
-[Danielle] Mm-hmm.
-[Judy] And this is

02:34.166 --> 02:35.533
a relatively small one.

02:35.600 --> 02:38.100
How many dogs do you
currently have, Mr. Bowens?

02:38.166 --> 02:39.567
-[Darrel] Two.
-[Judy] You have this one?

02:39.633 --> 02:41.667
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] Whose name is Pockets.

02:41.734 --> 02:43.266
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] You're his wife?

02:43.333 --> 02:44.767
-No.
-[Judy] Who are you?

02:44.834 --> 02:46.000
His colleague and friend.

02:46.066 --> 02:48.000
-But the dog seems
very comfortable with you.

02:48.066 --> 02:49.700
He's comfortable with everyone.

02:49.767 --> 02:52.367
[Judy] Anyway, you decided
to go into business together.

02:52.433 --> 02:57.667
And this case is about breeding
rights and ownership of the dog,

02:57.734 --> 02:59.066
and where the dog
is going to live.

02:59.133 --> 03:00.133
Right.

03:00.200 --> 03:01.867
And how we're
going to sort out this mess

03:01.934 --> 03:03.567
because
you're no longer friends.

03:03.633 --> 03:05.100
Because of this issue.

03:05.166 --> 03:06.734
[Judy] You're no longer friends,

03:06.800 --> 03:09.967
and Pockets
has to have a stable home.

03:10.033 --> 03:11.266
He does.

03:11.333 --> 03:13.967
[Judy] On what date
did you purchase Pockets?

03:14.033 --> 03:15.433
October 13th, 2020.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.233
Who did you
purchase the dog from?

03:17.300 --> 03:21.533
I bought him from
Spottadachs Dachshunds in Utah.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.967
He was a breeder dog for her.

03:23.033 --> 03:25.166
How expensive was the dog?

03:25.233 --> 03:26.433
[Danielle]
Thirty-one hundred dollars.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.633
-2,500 for the dog, and six--
-[Judy] Shhh.

03:28.700 --> 03:31.133
-Okay.
-How much was the dog?

03:31.200 --> 03:32.567
[Danielle]
Thirty-one hundred dollars.

03:32.633 --> 03:34.633
-No.
-How much did I spend with--?

03:34.700 --> 03:36.433
Okay, 2,500.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.367
[Judy] The dog was
2,500 dollars.

03:38.433 --> 03:39.367
Right.

03:39.433 --> 03:41.433
And did you discuss
with Mr. Bowens

03:41.500 --> 03:44.133
-splitting the cost of the dog?
-[Danielle] Um--

03:44.200 --> 03:46.200
Let's be very careful
about this, Miss Nantz.

03:46.266 --> 03:51.967
Did you discuss with Mr. Bowens
splitting the cost of the dog?

03:52.033 --> 03:52.967
We did.

03:53.033 --> 03:55.433
Was that prior
to picking the dog up

03:55.500 --> 03:57.266
on the 13th of October?

03:57.333 --> 03:58.467
We had talked about it,

03:58.533 --> 03:59.834
but he didn't want
to pay for shipping,

03:59.900 --> 04:02.333
-so I bought the dog by myself.
-[Judy] Just a second.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.433
-You had talked with him--
-[Danielle] Hm-mm.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.467
[Judy] --about splitting
the cost of the dog.

04:06.533 --> 04:07.467
Right.

04:07.533 --> 04:09.100
[Judy] And when you
talked to him

04:09.166 --> 04:11.900
about splitting
the cost of the dog,

04:11.967 --> 04:14.000
did you also discuss,

04:14.066 --> 04:17.834
either orally or commit
to a written instrument,

04:17.900 --> 04:20.934
what the contractual
relationship was

04:21.000 --> 04:23.734
between the two of you
with regard to the dog?

04:23.800 --> 04:24.867
We did not do that.

04:24.934 --> 04:28.000
So, you picked up the dog
on 10-13-2020?

04:28.066 --> 04:30.266
He was shipped to me
from Utah.

04:30.333 --> 04:32.000
[Judy] Subsequent to that,

04:32.066 --> 04:37.867
you turned over physical custody
of Pockets to Mr. Bowens?

04:37.934 --> 04:39.233
In March,

04:39.300 --> 04:41.433
-when his dog was in heat.
-[Judy] So, March 1.

04:41.500 --> 04:44.667
-[Danielle] March 14.
-Of 20--?

04:44.734 --> 04:46.266
[Danielle] 2021.

04:46.333 --> 04:48.166
-[Judy] Okay.
-About March 14th,

04:48.233 --> 04:49.066
it might be the 13th,

04:49.133 --> 04:50.700
it was right before
my dog had puppies.

04:50.767 --> 04:51.834
[Judy] Okay.

04:51.900 --> 04:55.367
And you turned your dog over
to Mr. Bowens on March 13th

04:55.433 --> 04:57.533
because your dog
was going to have puppies?

04:57.600 --> 04:58.600
[Danielle]
That was the agreement.

04:58.667 --> 04:59.867
His dog was coming into heat

04:59.934 --> 05:00.934
-and my dog was having puppies.
-[Judy] Alright, just a second.

05:01.266 --> 05:02.800
Your dog was having puppies.

05:02.867 --> 05:06.600
-[Danielle] Mm-hmm.
-So, between October and March,

05:06.667 --> 05:08.734
-you had no contact?
-We were in an argument

05:08.800 --> 05:11.000
because he didn't want to pay
for the shipping of the dog,

05:11.066 --> 05:12.333
and stormed out of my house,

05:12.400 --> 05:14.767
so we were not talking
until February.

05:14.834 --> 05:17.266
[Judy] Okay. Then something
happened in February.

05:17.333 --> 05:18.934
I called him
and buried the hatchet.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.066
Okay, you called him
in February and said--

05:22.133 --> 05:24.100
I called him
in February and said,

05:24.166 --> 05:27.367
"I apologize for the part
that I played in our arguing.

05:27.433 --> 05:30.433
And I hope that we can be
friends again."

05:30.500 --> 05:33.200
Great. Do you remember
that conversation, Mr. Bowens?

05:33.266 --> 05:35.233
-Yes, ma'am. I do.
-[Judy] Good.

05:35.300 --> 05:36.300
It came, but I mean,

05:36.367 --> 05:40.166
it came from different
parts of our friends.

05:40.233 --> 05:41.800
-[Judy] Mutual friends?
-Yes.

05:41.867 --> 05:43.300
-[Judy] Okay. That's fine
-She-she-she was

05:43.367 --> 05:46.000
-sending messages.
-[Judy] So, in February.

05:46.066 --> 05:47.433
I'm not sure on the timeline

05:47.500 --> 05:49.600
because I think I had Pockets, you know,

05:49.667 --> 05:53.066
like when she put
the deposit down for Pockets,

05:53.133 --> 05:55.100
she hadn't paid
for Pockets in October.

05:55.166 --> 05:56.934
She had only put
the deposit down.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.433
-Then later, we would--
-Okay.

05:58.500 --> 05:59.767
-[Darrel] Okay, sorry.
-[Danielle] It's not true.

05:59.834 --> 06:01.467
Mr. Bowens,
I'm going to stop.

06:01.533 --> 06:02.667
I'm gonna stop right there.

06:02.734 --> 06:06.233
When the dog was purchased
in October,

06:06.300 --> 06:09.500
did you pay the full cost
of the dog?

06:09.567 --> 06:11.133
-Yes, I did.
-[Judy] Okay.

06:11.200 --> 06:12.767
-Do you have proof of that?
-I do.

06:12.834 --> 06:13.834
I'd like to see it.

06:22.667 --> 06:25.166
Well, you usually get
a full contract with this.

06:25.233 --> 06:26.467
That's what I got from her.

06:26.533 --> 06:28.200
I didn't sign a contract.

06:28.266 --> 06:29.900
I just got an invoice
for purchasing him.

06:29.967 --> 06:32.133
Is he an AKC registered dog?

06:32.200 --> 06:33.133
[Danielle] Yes, ma'am.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.567
[Judy] Well, you always get
some sort of a contract

06:35.633 --> 06:37.367
when you buy a dog
from a breeder.

06:37.433 --> 06:38.533
She didn't give me a contract.

06:38.600 --> 06:41.433
We didn't have--
this is what I got from her.

06:41.500 --> 06:45.567
That's unusual.
That's actually very unusual.

06:45.633 --> 06:47.200
-Is it?
-[Danielle] Yeah.

06:47.266 --> 06:49.133
Absolutely.
I've owned dogs all my life.

06:49.200 --> 06:53.834
And I've had a particular
breed that I like very much.

06:53.900 --> 06:57.100
And every breeder-- well,
the two or three that I've used,

06:57.166 --> 06:59.934
has always had a certificate
of good health,

07:00.066 --> 07:02.900
whether you can use the dog
for breeding purposes,

07:02.967 --> 07:05.967
whether you have to have the dog
neutered at a certain time,

07:06.033 --> 07:10.166
what vaccines the dog has had,
so I know all of these things.

07:10.233 --> 07:11.934
These I take
from my own history.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.433
That's what happens
when you get old.

07:13.500 --> 07:14.834
You have a life's history.

07:14.900 --> 07:15.834
[upbeat music]

07:15.900 --> 07:17.467
Miss Nantz,
I have to tell you something.

07:17.533 --> 07:20.767
I can always tell
from someone's hesitancy

07:20.834 --> 07:24.400
whether or not they're
giving me an accurate story.

07:24.467 --> 07:27.867
That last part of it
was a make-up-as-you-go.

07:33.734 --> 07:36.834
[dramatic music]

07:38.500 --> 07:43.100
[narrator] Danielle Nantz claims
her former friend Darrel Bowens

07:43.166 --> 07:46.300
owes her for the cost
of a miniature Dachshund.

07:46.367 --> 07:49.633
Darrel is countersuing,
claiming Danielle owes him

07:49.700 --> 07:52.066
for his portion of the dog's costs.

07:52.133 --> 07:53.800
So, this looks stupid to me

07:53.867 --> 07:54.800
-from somebody who's breeding.
-[Danielle] Really?

07:54.867 --> 07:55.934
-[Judy] Really.
-Okay.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.166
Looks stupid to me from
somebody who is buying this dog

08:01.233 --> 08:03.934
for the purposes of breeding it.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.367
And if this is all you've got,
then this is a,

08:07.433 --> 08:09.900
probably a game
you shouldn't be playing

08:09.967 --> 08:12.000
if you accept--
the breeding game.

08:12.066 --> 08:13.800
-Okay.
-It's probably the game

08:13.867 --> 08:15.800
that you shouldn't be playing
because you don't--

08:15.867 --> 08:18.200
this, you think,
is what everybody gets.

08:18.266 --> 08:22.200
And I had no intention
to breeding my dog, but--

08:22.266 --> 08:24.233
[laughs] I know the contract
that I signed,

08:24.300 --> 08:27.700
I know the papers that I got,
and if this is all you've got--

08:27.767 --> 08:30.767
In any event, at some point,
you buried the hatchet.

08:30.834 --> 08:33.100
Subsequent to that,
you think it was before,

08:33.166 --> 08:35.367
but it was at least in March.

08:35.433 --> 08:36.367
At least in March.

08:36.433 --> 08:41.066
Okay. How old was Pockets
when you got him in October?

08:41.133 --> 08:43.767
He was, um, almost three.

08:43.834 --> 08:44.734
Three months old?

08:44.800 --> 08:45.767
[Danielle] Almost three years old.

08:45.834 --> 08:49.633
He was born December 29th, 2017.

08:49.700 --> 08:52.767
[Judy] And she was
clearly selling him then

08:52.834 --> 08:54.166
for 2,500 dollars,

08:54.233 --> 08:58.867
which was an expensive price
for an adult dog.

08:58.934 --> 09:00.433
So, this wasn't a puppy.

09:00.500 --> 09:03.367
You were buying this dog
for rehoming purposes.

09:03.433 --> 09:04.400
It's like rehoming,

09:04.467 --> 09:06.266
but you were buying the dog
for breeding

09:06.333 --> 09:08.433
because she had not
had the dog neutered.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.133
Right.
He was a breeding dog for her,

09:10.200 --> 09:12.567
and he was going to be
a breeding dog for me.

09:12.633 --> 09:14.467
Um, he is Embark clear,

09:14.533 --> 09:16.567
so he's not got
any genetic issues.

09:16.633 --> 09:18.633
And that's why
I was feeling comfortable enough

09:18.700 --> 09:19.767
to pay as much
as I did for him.

09:19.834 --> 09:21.100
So, instead of buying a dog

09:21.166 --> 09:22.900
and not knowing if it has
PRA or something.

09:22.967 --> 09:25.633
On what date
did Mr. Bowens give you

09:25.700 --> 09:27.734
1,250 dollars?

09:27.800 --> 09:29.567
It was when his,

09:29.633 --> 09:31.233
the day that his puppies
went home.

09:31.300 --> 09:34.133
-What date did Mr. Bowens--?
-[Darrel] It's gonna be,

09:34.200 --> 09:35.800
the total amount was paid,

09:35.867 --> 09:36.800
-Your Honor, on--
-[Judy] No, no, no,

09:36.867 --> 09:39.266
-just answer my question.
-July the 28th.

09:39.333 --> 09:41.133
-July--?
-[Darrel] The 28th.

09:41.200 --> 09:42.834
Yeah, that was the day
that the puppies went home.

09:42.900 --> 09:44.967
That's the date
the puppies could go home.

09:45.033 --> 09:46.867
[Judy] So, when you say
that's the date

09:46.934 --> 09:48.734
that the puppies could go home,

09:48.800 --> 09:54.700
you used Pockets to breed
with a female that you owned?

09:54.767 --> 09:57.834
I used my dog Pockets

09:57.900 --> 09:59.567
-to breed with--
-Shh, I haven't decided

09:59.633 --> 10:00.900
-whose dog it is.
-[Darrel] I'm sorry.

10:00.967 --> 10:02.934
Up until you make
your decision--

10:03.000 --> 10:04.266
[Judy] You used Pockets?

10:04.333 --> 10:05.633
Yes, ma'am.

10:05.700 --> 10:07.166
With her permission?

10:08.300 --> 10:12.166
Did you tell her that you were
going to breed Pockets?

10:12.233 --> 10:13.333
[Darrel] Yes, she knew

10:13.400 --> 10:14.567
-I was gonna breed Poc--
-No, not what she knew.

10:14.633 --> 10:16.400
-That's not my question.
-Okay.

10:16.467 --> 10:19.800
[Judy] Did you tell her that
you were going to breed Pockets?

10:19.867 --> 10:20.867
Yes, ma'am.

10:20.934 --> 10:22.033
[Judy] Is that correct?

10:22.100 --> 10:22.967
It is.

10:23.033 --> 10:23.967
So, you had a discussion about it.

10:24.033 --> 10:26.367
Was that discussion in person
or over the phone?

10:26.433 --> 10:29.033
In person.
We hang out a lot, we used to.

10:29.100 --> 10:30.367
Okay. So, by that time,

10:30.433 --> 10:32.333
you had sort of
sorted things out.

10:32.400 --> 10:35.066
-[Danielle] Mm-mm.
-And you bred Pockets

10:35.133 --> 10:37.467
with a female that you owned?

10:37.533 --> 10:39.867
-That I purchased from her, yes.
-[Judy] Okay.

10:39.934 --> 10:41.467
-Great.
-When did you purchase

10:41.533 --> 10:43.667
that female from the plaintiff?

10:43.734 --> 10:45.500
-[Darrel] Okay.
-He didn't buy it from me.

10:45.567 --> 10:47.333
-[Judy] No, no, no.
-Okay.

10:47.400 --> 10:49.200
-I didn't buy the dog.
-[Judy] No, no, just a second.

10:49.266 --> 10:50.834
-Don't speak.
-Okay.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.233
[Judy] I'm not looking
at you now.

10:52.300 --> 10:53.400
[Darrel] Okay, let me
explain this.

10:53.467 --> 10:55.200
We were co-workers at a company.

10:55.266 --> 10:58.000
And she was looking
for another job.

10:58.066 --> 11:02.300
And she has a trouble
of keeping jobs and being happy.

11:02.367 --> 11:03.300
I understand.

11:03.367 --> 11:04.567
[Judy] Don't
editorialize for me.

11:04.633 --> 11:05.567
[Darrel] I'm not gonna do it,

11:05.633 --> 11:06.567
-I'm sorry.
-[Judy] This case is

11:06.633 --> 11:07.567
gonna be long enough as it is.

11:07.633 --> 11:08.834
-Okay. All right.
-[Judy] Okay.

11:08.900 --> 11:12.233
What I saw in her was
that she was great with dogs.

11:12.300 --> 11:14.200
She had a lot of knowledge about dogs

11:14.266 --> 11:15.533
with my previous experience

11:15.600 --> 11:17.433
before we start working together.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.400
During the process
of our friendship,

11:19.467 --> 11:21.567
she had a litter of puppies
that she made

11:21.633 --> 11:23.800
quite a substantial
amount of money on.

11:23.867 --> 11:26.400
And so while she's looking
for this different job,

11:26.467 --> 11:29.200
because she doesn't feel like
she's doing well on-on the job

11:29.266 --> 11:32.033
that we're on, and I was
one of the top agents,

11:32.100 --> 11:33.500
I said, "Look, all my life

11:33.567 --> 11:35.867
I've done stuff
that I like to do.

11:35.934 --> 11:37.033
You love puppies,

11:37.100 --> 11:38.867
but you just had
a litter of puppies."

11:38.934 --> 11:40.233
And what she did
with a male puppy

11:40.300 --> 11:42.367
was fix her male puppy
and gave him away.

11:42.433 --> 11:44.533
Then she was getting ready
to give away her female puppy

11:44.600 --> 11:45.633
after she got her fixed.

11:45.700 --> 11:48.100
She got the male puppy
that just bred the puppies

11:48.166 --> 11:49.100
and gave him away.

11:49.166 --> 11:50.233
Then she was gonna do
the same thing

11:50.300 --> 11:51.934
[clears throat] with Daphne.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.066
[Judy] With Daphne?

11:53.133 --> 11:54.500
-Her female puppy.
-Her female.

11:54.567 --> 11:56.266
-[Darrel] Right.
-Well, her female dog.

11:56.333 --> 11:57.500
[Darrel] Female dog.
I'm sorry, yeah.

11:57.567 --> 11:58.934
How old is the dog?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.066
-[Darrel] I thought--
-I wasn't giving her away.

12:00.133 --> 12:02.200
I was gonna fix her
to not have any more puppies.

12:02.266 --> 12:03.700
How old was Daphne?

12:03.767 --> 12:04.700
[Danielle] At that time?

12:04.767 --> 12:06.700
Yes. She just had
a litter of puppies.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.100
She was two and a half.

12:08.166 --> 12:11.567
So, you were going to
have her fixed and rehome her?

12:11.633 --> 12:13.233
No, I was not
going to rehome her.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.233
[Judy] You were going to keep her.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.233
Keep her. I was just hoping

12:15.300 --> 12:16.266
I wasn't gonna have more puppies.

12:16.333 --> 12:17.300
[Judy] Okay.

12:17.367 --> 12:18.800
You subsequently
changed your mind.

12:18.867 --> 12:19.800
I did. Darrel talked me out of it.

12:19.867 --> 12:21.066
[Judy] Okay, just, just--

12:21.133 --> 12:24.567
Yeah. [exhales deeply]

12:24.633 --> 12:26.266
[Judy] And Daphne
went to live with him?

12:26.333 --> 12:27.266
-No.
-No.

12:27.333 --> 12:29.233
-[Judy] No.
-She still lives with her.

12:29.300 --> 12:30.867
So, Daphne
still lives with you.

12:30.934 --> 12:33.166
What about Daphne's puppies?

12:33.233 --> 12:36.700
Did one of Daphne's puppies
go to the defendant?

12:36.767 --> 12:38.166
No, never.

12:38.233 --> 12:39.867
[Judy] Never. According to you,

12:39.934 --> 12:43.467
the female dog that he has,
he didn't get from you.

12:43.533 --> 12:45.333
I just helped him find it online.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.500
Well, tell me about that.

12:47.567 --> 12:49.433
[Danielle] Okay, I found her
on PuppyFind,

12:49.500 --> 12:52.066
and I made an agreement
with the person

12:52.133 --> 12:54.533
that was selling the puppy.

12:54.600 --> 12:57.867
So, you found
this puppy on PuppyFind.

12:57.934 --> 13:00.834
-Mm-hmm.
-And contacted this person.

13:00.900 --> 13:02.467
-Mm-hmm.
-Was this person

13:02.533 --> 13:04.433
selling the dog
or giving it away?

13:04.500 --> 13:05.433
[Danielle] Selling.

13:05.500 --> 13:06.433
For how much?

13:06.500 --> 13:09.400
-I didn't pay for her,
so I think it was 1,200.

13:09.467 --> 13:11.834
[Judy] And what was
that puppy's name?

13:11.900 --> 13:13.133
-Eventually?
-[Danielle] Pearl.

13:13.200 --> 13:16.533
Did Pearl eventually
wind up with Mr. Bowens?

13:16.600 --> 13:18.633
-Yes, from the beginning.
-[Judy shushes]

13:18.700 --> 13:20.400
Sorry. [breathes deeply]

13:20.467 --> 13:23.767
[Judy] And that's
the female dog, Pearl,

13:23.834 --> 13:27.567
that ultimately had a litter
of puppies with Pockets?

13:27.633 --> 13:29.100
[Darrel] Yes.

13:29.166 --> 13:31.867
Okay. Now,
where did Pearl come from?

13:31.934 --> 13:33.500
-Did she--? What state?
-Texas.

13:33.567 --> 13:34.600
[Judy] Texas.

13:34.667 --> 13:38.934
And tell me how you communicated
with Mr. Bowens then,

13:39.000 --> 13:44.266
that you had located a puppy
for 1,200 dollars in Texas?

13:44.333 --> 13:45.266
I think that--

13:45.333 --> 13:47.967
I imagine it was in person
or over the phone.

13:48.033 --> 13:49.300
I think it was over the phone.

13:49.367 --> 13:53.100
Um, and at the time,
I had planned in the beginning,

13:53.166 --> 13:54.100
I was going to keep her,

13:54.166 --> 13:56.233
but then he said that he would
like to have her.

13:56.300 --> 13:57.367
So that's how that happened.

13:57.433 --> 13:58.567
Okey-dokey.

13:58.633 --> 14:00.967
Well, Miss Nantz, I have to
tell you something.

14:01.033 --> 14:03.333
I have this thing
in the back of my neck.

14:03.400 --> 14:04.934
It twitches one way to another.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.934
So, I can always tell
from someone's hesitancy

14:09.000 --> 14:12.400
whether or not they're
giving me an accurate story.

14:12.467 --> 14:16.567
That last part of it
was a make-up-as-you-go.

14:16.633 --> 14:18.734
Mr. Bowens,
you want to tell me how

14:18.800 --> 14:20.633
-Yes, ma'am.
-Pearl got into your custody?

14:20.700 --> 14:21.700
[Darrel] Yes, ma'am.

14:21.767 --> 14:24.000
[dramatic music]

14:24.066 --> 14:25.633
Subsequent to that, I said,

14:25.700 --> 14:29.266
did he give you any money?
And you said no.

14:29.333 --> 14:32.166
You want to read that
back to me? Subsequent.

14:32.233 --> 14:33.533
[Danielle]
Which means before, right?

14:33.600 --> 14:34.633
I mean, I'm not stupid but--

14:34.700 --> 14:36.266
If you're not stupid,
don't play stupid.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.900
If you're not stupid,
don't play stupid

14:37.967 --> 14:38.967
when it's convenient.

14:39.033 --> 14:40.467
There were two words
most people know.

14:40.533 --> 14:42.800
Previous is before,
subsequent is after.

14:42.867 --> 14:44.000
Okay, I had it backwards.

14:44.066 --> 14:45.166
Well, that's too bad.

14:45.233 --> 14:46.433
[dramatic music]

14:49.266 --> 14:52.333
[upbeat music]

14:55.934 --> 14:59.333
[narrator] Danielle Nantz
has accused her former friend

14:59.400 --> 15:02.834
Darrel Bowens of refusing
to return or pay for

15:02.900 --> 15:05.567
the miniature Dachshund
she purchased.

15:05.633 --> 15:08.066
Darrel says Danielle
gave him the dog

15:08.133 --> 15:10.333
and owes him
for the dog's costs.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.667
Okay, Mr. Bowens,
you want to tell me how--

15:12.734 --> 15:13.667
Yes, ma'am.

15:13.734 --> 15:14.967
[Judy] --Pearl got
into your custody?

15:15.033 --> 15:16.734
Yes, ma'am.
She came to me.

15:16.800 --> 15:17.734
[Judy] In person?

15:17.800 --> 15:19.166
-Yes. In person.
-[Judy] Or on the phone?

15:19.233 --> 15:20.166
In person.

15:20.233 --> 15:21.166
-Most of our transactions--
-At your ho--

15:21.233 --> 15:22.700
At your home or at the off--?

15:22.767 --> 15:25.667
At one of, I mean,
we hung out, barbecued.

15:25.734 --> 15:26.667
-Okay.
-Okay.

15:26.734 --> 15:28.066
So, she was at your house.

15:28.133 --> 15:31.266
Right. Well, it might have been
at her rental house.

15:31.333 --> 15:33.867
She had a longtime resident
left it in a mess.

15:33.934 --> 15:36.834
I went over there,
free of charge, as a friend,

15:36.900 --> 15:38.033
to help her paint it.

15:38.100 --> 15:41.633
I also offered her to pay
for the outside of the paint

15:41.700 --> 15:43.133
so she could go ahead
and match the color

15:43.200 --> 15:46.066
so she could just sell it
instead of just renting it out.

15:46.133 --> 15:48.266
During that time,
she was concerned,

15:48.333 --> 15:51.333
by not working,
that she wouldn't have the money

15:51.400 --> 15:52.800
for her mortgage.

15:52.867 --> 15:55.633
She asked me,
would I purchase Pearl?

15:55.700 --> 15:57.900
And I said,
"Sure I'll purchase Pearl,"

15:57.967 --> 15:59.700
-so she could cover her mortgage.
-Was Pearl--

15:59.767 --> 16:02.166
was Pearl
already in her custody?

16:02.233 --> 16:04.200
As I can remember, yes.

16:04.266 --> 16:06.967
But it's possible
that she had just negotiated

16:07.033 --> 16:07.967
-with this woman in Texas.
-[Darrel] Because this is over

16:08.033 --> 16:09.633
a three-year period
with a friend

16:09.700 --> 16:10.767
that you're not having to

16:10.834 --> 16:12.233
recalculate everything,
you know.

16:12.300 --> 16:15.166
[Judy] Okay.
But you gave her money--

16:15.233 --> 16:16.300
-Yes.
-[Judy] --for that dog?

16:16.367 --> 16:17.333
[Darrel] Absolutely.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.233
-And that dog--
-So she can cover her mortgage.

16:19.300 --> 16:21.233
And that dog
was 1,200 dollars?

16:21.300 --> 16:23.166
[Darrel] I think it was
a thousand dollars,

16:23.233 --> 16:26.033
and then 200 dollars
for the transportation

16:26.100 --> 16:28.000
if I'm not-- you know,
I have to go with her word,

16:28.066 --> 16:29.066
which-- [laughs]

16:29.133 --> 16:31.166
[Judy] Okay.
Does that sound right?

16:31.233 --> 16:32.166
I think that sounds right.

16:32.233 --> 16:36.066
Oh, it sounds like
a complete story to me

16:36.133 --> 16:39.800
that makes sense, as opposed
to what you told me a moment ago.

16:39.867 --> 16:44.367
Okay. So, now we have this dog
father a litter of puppies.

16:44.433 --> 16:50.266
Pockets has been in your custody
for March, April, May,

16:50.333 --> 16:55.100
June, July, August,
and so far in September?

16:55.166 --> 16:56.934
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] Seven months.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.400
-Or more.
-[Judy] Or more.

16:58.467 --> 17:01.000
And the dog,
for the last seven months,

17:01.066 --> 17:04.467
the dog was in your custody, this dog,

17:04.533 --> 17:09.333
October, November, December,
January, February,

17:09.400 --> 17:10.367
and part of March?

17:10.433 --> 17:11.367
Right.

17:11.433 --> 17:14.633
[Judy] Correct?
And the dog has been now,

17:14.700 --> 17:18.767
if you get the dog back,
in three homes?

17:18.834 --> 17:20.200
Total. Mm-mm.

17:20.266 --> 17:23.066
Yes. As an adult dog.
So far, am I correct?

17:23.133 --> 17:28.100
So far, the dog has been living
with him the last seven months.

17:28.166 --> 17:31.033
And it was rehomed
by its original owner

17:31.100 --> 17:33.967
when it was two and a half
or three, to you.

17:34.033 --> 17:36.300
So, I want you to understand,
Miss Nantz.

17:36.367 --> 17:40.033
If he paid anything to you,
you're not getting the dog back.

17:40.100 --> 17:43.633
I want you to understand that.
There is a certain humanity.

17:43.700 --> 17:46.100
So, my question to you is,

17:46.166 --> 17:50.600
did Mr. Bowens give you any money?

17:50.667 --> 17:54.600
We're not talking about
for the other dog,

17:54.667 --> 17:56.934
the female dog
that you got from Texas.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.867
I'm talking about,
subsequent to Pockets

18:00.934 --> 18:04.066
going to live with Mr. Bowens,
did he give you any money?

18:04.200 --> 18:05.066
No.

18:05.133 --> 18:06.433
-[Judy] No money?
-No money.

18:06.500 --> 18:07.800
[Judy] Okay.

18:10.700 --> 18:13.000
That's a lie.
According to you.

18:13.066 --> 18:14.600
-How's that?
-[Judy] According to you,

18:14.667 --> 18:15.734
that's a lie,

18:15.800 --> 18:17.867
because you swore
to a complaint.

18:17.934 --> 18:23.133
And in your complaint,
you say on June 2nd, 2021,

18:23.200 --> 18:26.900
Darrel gave me 1,250 dollars.

18:26.967 --> 18:28.233
[Danielle] Well, subsequent
means before, right?

18:28.300 --> 18:29.567
No subse--

18:29.633 --> 18:30.633
Subsequent to.

18:30.700 --> 18:34.033
[Judy] I said
subsequent to Pockets.

18:34.100 --> 18:36.567
-[Danielle] Living--
-Going to live with him,

18:36.633 --> 18:38.967
which was at least in March,

18:39.033 --> 18:40.934
according to you -
pay attention.

18:41.000 --> 18:41.934
Mm-mm.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.734
[Judy] Which was in least
in March, according to you.

18:45.800 --> 18:48.400
Subsequent to that,
my question was simple.

18:48.467 --> 18:51.233
And I said it three times,
and you're an intelligent woman.

18:51.300 --> 18:56.333
So, subsequent to that, I said,
did he give you any money?

18:56.400 --> 18:57.667
And you said no.

18:57.734 --> 19:00.800
You want to read
that back to me? Subsequent.

19:00.867 --> 19:02.066
[Danielle]
Which means before, right?

19:02.133 --> 19:03.300
I mean, I'm not stupid but--

19:03.367 --> 19:04.900
If you're not stupid,
don't play stupid.

19:04.967 --> 19:07.333
If you're not stupid, don't play stupid
when it's convenient.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.033
There were two words
most people know.

19:09.100 --> 19:11.000
Previous is before,
subsequent is after.

19:11.066 --> 19:12.533
Okay, I had it backwards.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.834
[Judy] Well, that's too bad.
I don't believe it.

19:14.900 --> 19:16.166
-You really should.
-[Judy] I don't,

19:16.233 --> 19:18.000
I don't believe it.
I was very clear.

19:18.066 --> 19:20.133
I said it three times or twice.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.867
Sorry, I didn't know
what subsequent meant.

19:21.934 --> 19:23.600
"I'm talking about
subsequent to Pockets

19:23.667 --> 19:26.233
going to live with Mr. Bowens,
did he give you any money?

19:26.300 --> 19:27.266
And she said no."

19:27.333 --> 19:28.667
Correct.
And that's not true.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.266
Yeah, he gave me 1,250 after.

19:30.333 --> 19:31.367
[Judy] Just a--

19:32.967 --> 19:36.834
Subsequent to Pockets
going to live with Mr. Bowens,

19:36.900 --> 19:41.066
he gave you
half of Pockets' cost,

19:41.133 --> 19:43.133
which was 2,500 dollars.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.266
Not including the shipping.

19:44.333 --> 19:47.700
[Judy] Just a second. [laughs]
I'm not talking about shipping.

19:47.767 --> 19:50.033
I'm talking about,
because I'm getting annoyed,

19:50.100 --> 19:54.300
subsequent to Pockets
going to live with Mr. Bowens

19:54.367 --> 19:56.166
for at least seven months.

19:56.233 --> 19:59.867
Now, subsequent
to March of 2021,

19:59.934 --> 20:03.800
he gave you 1,250 dollars,

20:03.867 --> 20:06.767
which is half the cost
of the dog.

20:06.834 --> 20:07.834
That's all I want to know.

20:07.900 --> 20:09.667
That doesn't mean
he paid for the whole dog.

20:09.734 --> 20:11.200
That doesn't mean
he paid for the whole dog.

20:11.266 --> 20:14.200
But he paid,
and it's a neat number

20:14.266 --> 20:16.300
because according to you before,

20:16.367 --> 20:19.200
you got into an argument
over the shipping costs.

20:19.266 --> 20:22.467
That's what the original
breakup of the friendship was.

20:22.533 --> 20:24.033
We don't have to go back
to that, Whitney,

20:24.100 --> 20:26.767
I actually remember that
distinctly,

20:26.834 --> 20:28.633
that they were good friends
with the barbeques

20:28.700 --> 20:29.734
and everything else together,

20:29.800 --> 20:31.133
and they were in
each other's houses.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.900
He went and painted your house
to help you out,

20:33.967 --> 20:35.433
blah blah blah, blah blah blah,
blah blah blah.

20:35.500 --> 20:38.700
You got into a kerfuffle
over the shipping costs

20:38.767 --> 20:43.000
because the shipping costs
for Pearl were 200,

20:43.066 --> 20:48.100
the shipping costs for Pockets was 600.

20:48.166 --> 20:49.600
Now it's all coming together.

20:49.667 --> 20:52.133
You say, "I'm not paying
600 dollars shipping cost,

20:52.200 --> 20:53.300
Pearl was 200.

20:53.367 --> 20:55.633
I'll pay the 200,
I'm not paying 600."

20:55.700 --> 20:59.300
You got into a fight
over 400 dollars.

20:59.367 --> 21:01.433
All right. Uh, I've sort of
had enough of this case.

21:01.500 --> 21:02.633
You want this dog, sir?

21:02.700 --> 21:04.100
Yes, ma'am, I do.
I love this dog.

21:04.166 --> 21:06.066
And this dog looks
very, very comfortable,

21:06.133 --> 21:08.100
very, very happy,
very contended,

21:08.166 --> 21:09.800
and very well taken care of.

21:09.867 --> 21:12.066
So, I'm going to
make you whole, madam.

21:12.133 --> 21:15.800
Judgment for the Plaintiff
in the amount of 1,250 dollars.

21:15.867 --> 21:17.333
We're finished here.
Thank you.

21:17.400 --> 21:18.400
[Kevin] Court is adjourned.

21:18.467 --> 21:20.700
[dramatic music]

21:20.767 --> 21:23.200
Darrel got greedy
after he had the puppies.

21:23.266 --> 21:26.100
I offered all of my time
and energy to help her out.

21:26.166 --> 21:27.734
He just doesn't care
about them like I do.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.133
I just wish her the best.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.500
Darrel will take good care of them.

21:30.567 --> 21:31.633
It's not about
the money with him.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.033
I love him dearly, you know.

21:34.133 --> 21:36.834
That dog, I had never
seen one quite like it.

21:36.900 --> 21:39.066
And it was a great-looking little dog,

21:39.133 --> 21:40.467
and it looked very, very happy.

21:40.533 --> 21:43.300
And I know that probably
the plaintiff isn't happy

21:43.367 --> 21:46.133
with that judgment,
but with that judgment,

21:46.200 --> 21:48.100
the dog doesn't get to move again.

21:48.166 --> 21:50.500
It's already had
three different homes

21:50.567 --> 21:52.500
in its relatively short life.

21:52.567 --> 21:56.066
So, I'm sort of happy
he's staying where he-he is,

21:56.133 --> 21:57.166
and he's comfortable.

21:57.233 --> 22:00.367
And plaintiff may not have
gotten all the money she wanted,

22:00.433 --> 22:01.367
but she's whole.

22:01.433 --> 22:03.800
She paid 2,500 dollars
for the dog,

22:03.867 --> 22:06.266
and she got 2,500 dollars
for the dog,

22:06.333 --> 22:07.934
and she had her house painted.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.333
I think the right thing happened.

22:09.400 --> 22:10.467
[Sarah] I agree.

22:12.300 --> 22:13.400
[narrator]
Have you been cheated?
