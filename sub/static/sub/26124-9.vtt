WEBVTT

00:47.290 --> 00:49.246
Hmm?

00:52.010 --> 00:53.125
You okay?

00:54.010 --> 00:55.500
Never been better.

01:04.600 --> 01:07.433
I lost 94 fucking pounds.
Ninety-four...

01:07.520 --> 01:10.068
- Here she is.
- Candy's late.

01:10.150 --> 01:13.529
Fashionably. Hey. Hey.
It's her night, it's her film.

01:13.610 --> 01:16.488
- Let her have her big entrance.
- Hey...

01:16.570 --> 01:18.401
Mr. and Mrs. Wasserman.

01:18.490 --> 01:20.822
- Mr. and Mrs. Martino.
- Ah!

01:21.580 --> 01:25.243
Mage/
on the premiere of your
very first producorial endeavor.

01:25.330 --> 01:29.585
All right.
So, how much money is this making us?

01:29.670 --> 01:33.162
Regrettably, this is an
invitation-only event, you understand?

01:33.260 --> 01:34.329
So, the tickets are gratis.

01:34.420 --> 01:37.878
But we open
in ten theaters on Thursday.

01:38.300 --> 01:39.460
That's all?

01:39.550 --> 01:41.848
That's a lot.
For porn, that's huge.

01:41.930 --> 01:43.136
- Huge.
- All right?

01:43.220 --> 01:45.688
Okay. All right, all right.

01:46.230 --> 01:48.266
Oh, uh, yeah, Harv...

01:49.310 --> 01:52.609
We're gonna do right by Christina
on the next one?

01:52.690 --> 01:54.430
I mean, leading role?

01:54.530 --> 01:56.486
- On the next one?
- Yeah.

01:56.570 --> 01:59.277
- I mean, we owe it.
- You mean you owe it.

01:59.660 --> 02:01.901
You know, we're gonna
figure that out later, all right?

02:01.990 --> 02:03.617
Enjoy yourselves tonight.

02:03.700 --> 02:05.748
- Okay. Okay.
- All right? Both of you.

02:05.830 --> 02:09.243
- A
maze/
top to you, my friend.
- Oh, my God. All right.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.412
- Love the tie.
- Beautiful.

02:11.500 --> 02:14.207
Turn this way. Let me see
that beautiful face, baby.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.790
Thank you.
Thank you, baby.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.052
Excuse me, baby,
let me get a photo. Baby? Hey.

02:22.140 --> 02:23.550
This way, please, come on.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.801
Come on, come on.
Give me something.

02:25.890 --> 02:28.688
- Looking beautiful, mama.
- Give me a smile, come on.

02:29.020 --> 02:31.557
Hey, baby, hey.
You're looking so pretty.

02:31.650 --> 02:33.220
Put a nice smile on.

02:34.280 --> 02:36.737
One more, one more,
one more. Sparkly diamonds.

02:36.820 --> 02:39.061
- Come on.
- Looking good.

02:39.160 --> 02:40.229
This way, this way.

02:48.410 --> 02:49.786
Congratulations, Candy.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.873
- Russ. Hey, Russ.
- Russell.

02:52.960 --> 02:55.292
- Ho, boy. Russ.
- I see some old friends

02:55.380 --> 02:57.621
- from when I was young.
- No problem.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.711
Okay. I'll catch you in there.

03:00.640 --> 03:03.097
Ten theaters and counting.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.636
And this.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.930
We made the trades.

03:09.730 --> 03:11.300
Tomorrow’s
Var/em

03:16.030 --> 03:17.645
Hey, Lori Madison.

03:21.030 --> 03:23.112
Hey, Lori, what's wrong?

03:23.200 --> 03:25.191
- Uh... Nothing.
- No, no, no.

03:25.290 --> 03:27.497
- Lori, talk to me.
- Just...

03:28.330 --> 03:30.571
I know he's gonna...
He's gonna show up here. I know.

03:30.670 --> 03:34.128
This is...
This is your night, all right?

03:34.710 --> 03:37.258
If his narrow ass shows up,
he's not getting anywhere near you.

03:37.340 --> 03:39.046
- Understand?
-Mmmmmm.

03:39.130 --> 03:41.928
Hey. My word is my bond.

03:44.470 --> 03:45.846
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:50.850 --> 03:52.977
Oh, my God. Look at you.

04:00.610 --> 04:02.100
Hot as balls.

04:04.280 --> 04:07.829
"...and the script is, at points,
blunt and knowing.

04:08.910 --> 04:10.901
"There's much to be admired here.

04:11.250 --> 04:15.994
"So much, in fact, that were it not
for the gratuitous punctuation

04:16.090 --> 04:20.834
"of hardcore pornographic imagery,
Red Hot
could be called..."

04:23.090 --> 04:25.718
"...an instant arthouse
tour-de-force."

04:27.970 --> 04:29.676
- Gratuitous?
- Never mind that.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.977
You are holding the best review
of a skin flick

04:32.060 --> 04:33.470
since
Behind the Green Door.

04:33.560 --> 04:36.472
The guy bought what you were selling.
This is a hit, Eileen.

04:36.560 --> 04:40.109
Forget about the raincoat crowd,
guys are gonna bring dates to this.

04:40.190 --> 04:42.567
Regular guys. Normal guys.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.190
- Normal?
-Hmm.

04:45.070 --> 04:47.447
Harvey, I keep telling you,
fuck normal.

04:47.660 --> 04:49.730
- Nobody's normal.
- Come here.

04:53.160 --> 04:56.243
Yeah, Lori. Yeah!

04:56.330 --> 04:58.878
- Congratulations, Lori.
- Yeah, Lori, yeah.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.700
You're beautiful, baby.

05:09.180 --> 05:11.842
Russ would be the idiot
with flowers on his arm.

05:11.930 --> 05:14.137
Let's just say it's not exactly
like the old days

05:14.230 --> 05:16.266
when you were fumbling around
with those Tri-Delt girls

05:16.350 --> 05:17.897
at the fall mixer.

05:17.980 --> 05:19.857
Only difference between
Candy and the Tri-Delt girls

05:19.940 --> 05:21.726
is Candy knows how to fuck.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.237
So, what's it like boning a porn star?

05:25.240 --> 05:27.652
It's like boning a porn star.

05:36.210 --> 05:38.747
- Shit.
- So, the screening's about

05:38.840 --> 05:41.240
to start, and I'd like you
to intro the film.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.126
You ready with a few words?

05:45.170 --> 05:46.216
Yeah.

07:26.110 --> 07:28.852
Well, I'm awake.

07:29.150 --> 07:31.812
What made you think this movie
was gonna keep them interested?

07:31.910 --> 07:33.775
I love this movie.

07:33.870 --> 07:37.988
Bill Holden is like the hero
without any of the hero bullshit.

07:38.080 --> 07:41.823
- He didn't want to go back.
- Yeah, but he did.

07:42.380 --> 07:44.371
I dunno, I read in the
TVGu/de
it was playing,

07:44.460 --> 07:46.451
and I thought
they would be ready for it.

07:46.550 --> 07:47.915
I mean, I was at their age.

07:48.010 --> 07:49.409
I remember I took two buses

07:49.510 --> 07:52.217
all the way to the Marine on Flatbush
to see it.

07:52.300 --> 07:55.133
- Marine's gone now.
- Yeah.

07:56.930 --> 07:59.342
Oh, fuck, we're on memory lane.

07:59.430 --> 08:02.558
- The years, you know?
- Christ, Vin, no.

08:02.650 --> 08:05.608
- No, don't even start.
- Yeah, you're not wrong.

08:06.110 --> 08:08.431
So, how's it going
with that guy from Cedarhurst?

08:08.530 --> 08:10.896
- The lawyer.
- Done. Done.

08:10.990 --> 08:11.979
Oh...

08:12.110 --> 08:13.771
I was rooting for that guy.

08:14.320 --> 08:17.073
You were rooting for an end
to the monthly checks,

08:17.160 --> 08:19.401
that's what you were rooting for.
Be honest.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.492
No. Fuck the money. The money's easy.

08:22.580 --> 08:24.320
Why can't I want you happy?

08:24.420 --> 08:27.548
Yeah, well, not with that mook,
that was for sure.

08:29.380 --> 08:30.790
And Abby? How's that?

08:32.260 --> 08:33.500
Good.

08:33.970 --> 08:36.677
I mean... I don't know.

08:37.810 --> 08:39.095
Good, but you don't know?

08:39.890 --> 08:43.519
She has her own things,
her own worlds.

08:44.730 --> 08:47.893
She's smarter than me,
which is great, but...

08:47.980 --> 08:52.269
You're smart, Vin. Don't play that
dumb bartender shit with me.

08:52.990 --> 08:54.946
She's book smart, and I'm not that.

08:55.320 --> 08:57.618
And it ain't even really
about the books.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.992
You know, when I...
When I met her, she was young,

09:01.080 --> 09:04.743
and there was this whole world
she didn't know about.

09:04.830 --> 09:08.914
But now it's like she sees the world
better than me.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.542
And me,
I think she sees right through.

09:12.970 --> 09:14.619
Just because she knows
more shit than you

09:14.720 --> 09:17.132
doesn't mean she won't
make you a good wnfe, VIn.

09:17.220 --> 09:20.508
She wants to get married
like I want a kidney stone.

09:20.600 --> 09:23.592
What about, uh, you know, kids?

09:25.140 --> 09:26.687
What do you want?

09:27.610 --> 09:29.146
I want a house and a wife

09:29.230 --> 09:31.278
and a bunch of rug rats
running around,

09:31.360 --> 09:34.773
and a dog and a cat and a goldfish,

09:35.240 --> 09:38.903
and a lawn and a driveway
with a Lincoln rusting in it.

09:40.530 --> 09:42.282
And I want to be
at the center of the world

09:42.370 --> 09:44.031
and never fucking sleep.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.285
Same as ever.

09:48.710 --> 09:52.168
Yeah, but I'm more mature than I was.

09:53.460 --> 09:54.791
I'm more thoughtful about it.

09:54.880 --> 09:56.211
Oh, thoughtful.

09:57.180 --> 09:58.829
Yeah, thoughtful.

10:07.980 --> 10:11.393
I'll help you, uh...
Put them to bed.

10:13.940 --> 10:15.430
Come on, Vincenzo.

10:16.450 --> 10:17.735
Oh, my God.

10:17.950 --> 10:20.407
I can't even lift him.
What are you feeding this guy?

10:20.490 --> 10:22.481
He's 11 now, Vin.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.116
- Come on.
- They grow.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.612
Yeah.
All right, come on, buddy.

10:27.370 --> 10:31.579
Come on. Here we go.
I can't carry you anymore.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.887
Angie, honey, come on, it's bedtime.

10:40.430 --> 10:41.920
Angie, wake up. Bedtime.

10:43.890 --> 10:45.517
Is Dad still here?

10:46.020 --> 10:48.432
Yeah, he's just taking
your brother upstairs.

10:49.270 --> 10:50.897
Go on, bedtime.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.431
Go on, brush your teeth.

11:03.080 --> 11:06.948
Yeah, you know, so,
you can figure that part out.

11:07.040 --> 11:08.359
I don't really care.

11:09.040 --> 11:10.200
You sure of this?

11:10.290 --> 11:11.780
Yeah.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.245
How you know?

11:13.340 --> 11:15.240
We know. We always know.

11:16.590 --> 11:17.796
Well, just that you're sure.

11:18.510 --> 11:19.716
Yeah, of course.

11:35.570 --> 11:38.357
Yeah?
- Yo, my man. You eat?

11:38.440 --> 11:41.022
- Not yet. You?
- No, let's run out.

11:41.320 --> 11:43.777
You fitting to go on
a food run? Count me in, okay?

11:43.870 --> 11:45.485
”Spanish joint with the good menudo?

11:45.580 --> 11:47.400
No, I got a new place
I wanna check out.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.115
- Yeah?
- Chinese.

11:49.210 --> 11:51.075
All right.
I could do with some /0 mein.

11:51.170 --> 11:53.627
Yeah. Come past and get me.

11:57.380 --> 11:59.621
- So you can't carry out for me?
- What you want?

11:59.920 --> 12:02.047
Egg foo young. Shrimp toast.

12:17.020 --> 12:18.931
You just passed it.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.850
- That place back there?
- Yeah.

12:27.870 --> 12:30.748
I don't know, man. Looks like
a mistake waiting to happen.

12:30.830 --> 12:32.149
Yeah.

13:04.240 --> 13:06.026
Don't slam it like that.

13:06.570 --> 13:09.903
Fuck. Shit's so stomped on,
no one needs to worry.

13:09.990 --> 13:13.539
Yeah, well, you ain't wrong.

13:14.250 --> 13:16.457
That's why we gonna go to the source.

13:16.540 --> 13:18.531
Stop talking that crazy shit, Rodney.

13:18.630 --> 13:20.700
Bitch, ain't nothing crazy about it.

13:22.470 --> 13:24.927
Hot Rod got it all figured out.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.355
This from the new place?

13:41.440 --> 13:43.146
No, new place ain't shit.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.326
Hey.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.286
My God.

13:52.370 --> 13:55.703
Looks like you're cramming for
a midterm ten years too late.

13:55.790 --> 13:58.076
- Hunting for a play.
- Which one?

13:58.290 --> 13:59.666
- The right one.
- Okay.

13:59.750 --> 14:01.490
Well, that narrows it down, I guess.

14:02.550 --> 14:05.166
- Glass Menagerie?
- That's a finalist,

14:05.260 --> 14:08.548
but I am also looking at O'Neill
and
Ah, l/l/liderness/

14:08.640 --> 14:10.130
and Inge.

14:10.720 --> 14:12.847
Maybe even
Richard I].

14:14.020 --> 14:15.135
That's a lot of auditions.

14:16.270 --> 14:19.228
Fuck auditions.
I am going to stage something.

14:21.900 --> 14:23.720
On my own, if I have to.

14:24.900 --> 14:27.812
On your own? Uh, where? How?

14:28.110 --> 14:30.863
Not a clue. But I'm gonna do it.

14:34.910 --> 14:37.617
And somewhere in here is my play.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.570
Something from the canon
with the kind of subtext

14:40.670 --> 14:42.831
that can be set to homosexual themes,

14:42.920 --> 14:45.252
something everyone thinks
is a straight play,

14:45.340 --> 14:49.083
and then we turn it on its head
and surprise the hell out of people.

14:52.510 --> 14:53.670
Glass Menagerie?

14:53.760 --> 14:56.058
Oh, come on, Tom Wingfield
has more of a crush

14:56.140 --> 14:58.631
on his sister's gentleman caller
than she does.

14:59.020 --> 15:00.976
Mmm.

15:01.480 --> 15:04.017
- Okay.
- I am going to do this, Paul.

15:04.860 --> 15:06.270
Somehow.

15:06.690 --> 15:08.988
I want this to be a theater group

15:09.070 --> 15:11.982
in the Village, of the Village,
and for the Village.

15:12.070 --> 15:16.279
And fuck every casting agent in town
who ever whispered me out of a room.

15:16.370 --> 15:17.530
Mmm.

15:18.710 --> 15:21.201
Well, you're gonna need
a stage somewhere.

15:21.290 --> 15:23.747
And money beyond that.

15:24.380 --> 15:26.371
- I'm not pressing you.
- I don't feel pressed,

15:26.460 --> 15:27.836
but I'm gonna do this with you.

15:28.220 --> 15:29.619
It's not a nightclub, Paul.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.290
- It's community theater.
- I know.

15:31.390 --> 15:32.459
This is how people stay poor.

15:32.550 --> 15:34.381
Yeah, well, I make enough money.

15:36.350 --> 15:37.760
Just promise me you'll stay away
from Richard.

15:37.850 --> 15:39.590
Nobody wants to see a gay hunchback.

15:39.690 --> 15:41.681
Thatis
Richard 171}
you lowbrow fuck.

15:41.770 --> 15:44.512
Yeah, you know me,
always grabbing at the wrong Dick.

15:50.780 --> 15:52.736
Yeah, this one's gonna be bad.

15:52.820 --> 15:54.651
Yeah, smoke them if you got them.

15:54.740 --> 15:56.321
One, two, three.

15:57.080 --> 15:59.401
Christ. You can smell him from here.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.199
He's gone ripe.

16:06.300 --> 16:08.700
Watch out he don't burst on you
when you pull back the rug.

16:09.630 --> 16:11.871
From the clothes, "he" was a "she."

16:11.970 --> 16:13.790
Not that you could tell otherwise.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.539
Her face is fucking moving.

16:16.970 --> 16:18.710
You want some VapoRub?

16:18.810 --> 16:20.266
Nah, I'm good.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.148
All right, I got shots
of the dumpster,

16:26.230 --> 16:28.278
of the rug, both ends of the alley.

16:28.820 --> 16:31.197
Let me know if you want
anything else, Chris.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.696
Okay.

16:33.700 --> 16:35.315
Got a Spina, Dorothy.

16:35.410 --> 16:36.820
Thirty-four years.

16:36.910 --> 16:39.322
Burlingame, California, address.

16:39.410 --> 16:41.492
All right, I don't want to lose
any trace evidence

16:41.580 --> 16:43.957
fucking around here in the alley,
so let's roll it back up,

16:44.040 --> 16:45.826
take the whole mess down to the ME.

16:48.300 --> 16:49.619
- Miss.
- Thank you, sir.

16:49.710 --> 16:51.371
...motherfucker.

16:52.170 --> 16:54.832
Shit, here come one of his.

16:54.930 --> 16:56.795
Oh, I like the way that sounds, Daddy.

16:56.890 --> 16:58.209
Who the fuck you calling Daddy?

16:58.310 --> 17:00.710
I was just thinking,
with C.C. in the wind,

17:00.810 --> 17:02.516
that I could maybe
earn for one of you.

17:02.600 --> 17:06.013
Earn?
Girl, you rough on pimps.

17:06.110 --> 17:07.429
-Mmmmmm.
- Says who?

17:07.520 --> 17:08.851
First you buried Reggie Love.

17:08.940 --> 17:11.397
- Now word is C.C.'s been iced.
-Mmmmmm.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.355
What word?

17:13.450 --> 17:15.441
C.C. probably took all his money
and went somewhere.

17:15.530 --> 17:18.408
- That ain't what the streets say.
- Well, fuck the streets.

17:18.490 --> 17:20.947
And I didn't
do nothing to Reggie neither.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.189
This ain't fair.

17:22.290 --> 17:23.780
Bad luck come in threes.

17:23.870 --> 17:26.202
So go on, bitch.
No one here gonna pimp you.

17:28.420 --> 17:31.878
Order up.
Pancakes with a side of sausage.

17:31.960 --> 17:33.257
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:33.340 --> 17:35.672
Over easy, hash browns, bacon.

17:41.100 --> 17:43.842
See if we have a pair like this
in the front window.

17:43.930 --> 17:46.899
If not, get these out there.
They always sell.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.417
- Hey.
- You need help?

18:08.170 --> 18:09.159
I know you.

18:10.250 --> 18:11.410
I don't think so.

18:11.500 --> 18:12.956
Yeah. I do.

18:15.550 --> 18:17.757
I think you got me
mistook for someone.

18:17.840 --> 18:20.889
Oh, not in a million years.
I wouldn't forget that face.

18:20.970 --> 18:24.633
Or, uh, everything else
that goes along with it.

18:31.690 --> 18:33.066
Get the fuck out.

18:33.360 --> 18:34.349
You hear me?

18:34.780 --> 18:36.600
Get the fuck outta here, asshole.

18:36.700 --> 18:39.191
- I didn't mean anything by it. Wait.
- Get out, asshole.

18:39.280 --> 18:42.192
Get the fuck out, and take
your shit-eating grin with you.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.120
The more cartoon, the better.

18:51.210 --> 18:53.201
The Ramones, Cramps, whatever.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.621
Back in England,
where it all began, it's political.

18:55.710 --> 18:58.372
Yeah, that's legit.
It's only legit over in London.

18:58.470 --> 18:59.459
Excuse me a minute.

18:59.550 --> 19:02.849
I gotta get over there, you know?
That's where they're doing it.

19:04.140 --> 19:05.266
Hey.

19:05.810 --> 19:07.550
Couldn't figure out how to spend it?

19:07.640 --> 19:09.380
I was giving it all to Dorothy.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.055
Yeah, so?

19:11.440 --> 19:13.067
I haven't seen her in a week.

19:13.150 --> 19:16.608
Not since Dave Hiller and his crew
packed up their shop and left.

19:17.400 --> 19:18.389
Maybe she went with him.

19:19.450 --> 19:20.906
Doubt it.

19:21.950 --> 19:23.269
She'll post up.

19:23.700 --> 19:24.860
Vincent.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.446
- Take a walk with me.
- Now?

19:29.290 --> 19:31.326
All right, give me a minute.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.047
I just need you out front.

19:36.460 --> 19:38.963
- Jeez, Rodney, you're serious.
- Yeah.

19:39.050 --> 19:40.426
Looking out is all.

19:40.510 --> 19:42.842
So no one can come in
and bother me none.

19:42.930 --> 19:45.501
Now, if you can do that, we set.

19:45.600 --> 19:48.091
Three, four minutes
of good looking out,

19:48.180 --> 19:49.636
then just walk away.

19:50.810 --> 19:53.051
I'll meet you back at the crib

19:53.860 --> 19:55.851
with all the candy I can carry.

20:00.820 --> 20:02.310
- Carlos?
- Gone.

20:02.410 --> 20:05.322
- But they...
- Gone, Vincent. He's gone.

20:06.030 --> 20:08.863
- But why?
- Fuck do I know?

20:09.830 --> 20:13.414
Black Frankie comes in today,
tells me like it's barely my business.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.536
Tommy Longo told him to
make it happen, and he did it.

20:15.630 --> 20:17.746
- He just fucking did.
- But what reason?

20:17.840 --> 20:19.831
Black Frankie says
that it got back to Rudy

20:19.920 --> 20:22.832
that Carlos was talking out of school.

20:22.930 --> 20:25.751
Him being a drunk,
they weren't gonna let it stand.

20:25.850 --> 20:28.762
Carlos. Jesus Christ.

20:28.850 --> 20:31.136
It's fucking me up, Vincent.

20:33.020 --> 20:36.103
Bobby, this is what's fucking you up?

20:36.650 --> 20:38.641
This right here? Carlos?

20:39.820 --> 20:41.230
Last we talked,

20:41.320 --> 20:43.697
you and my brother were running out
in the middle of the night

20:43.780 --> 20:46.988
to get bleach
to wipe down the fucking parlor

20:47.080 --> 20:51.574
because you two lost your fucking mind
and killed a pimp on the premises.

20:51.660 --> 20:54.743
You killed him over bullshit,
Bobby, all right?

20:55.130 --> 20:58.088
And now you're gonna get emotional?

20:58.710 --> 21:00.007
I mean, you fucking kidding me?

21:00.340 --> 21:01.716
This is different.

21:02.260 --> 21:04.637
- Different how?
- It's one of our own.

21:04.720 --> 21:06.460
You think I'm gonna
squeeze out some tears

21:06.550 --> 21:08.051
over fucking C.C.?

21:08.140 --> 21:10.381
He had it coming for 12
different reasons, and you know it.

21:10.470 --> 21:13.189
But this was one of
our own people, Vincent.

21:13.480 --> 21:16.802
And even so, Rudy and Tommy,
they just reach right around me,

21:16.900 --> 21:20.609
tap Black Frankie to put a bullet
in a guy's head.

21:20.690 --> 21:23.022
Black Frankie,
who supposedly works for us,

21:23.110 --> 21:24.987
but when he gets an order from Tommy,

21:25.070 --> 21:27.618
he drops one of our own.
You see what I'm saying?

21:27.700 --> 21:30.988
What happens when Tommy tells
Black Frankie or whoever

21:31.080 --> 21:33.492
that it's my turn? Or yours?

21:38.840 --> 21:40.205
Homicide.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.956
Yeah, hang on.

21:42.050 --> 21:44.507
- History?
- Lots of it.

21:45.010 --> 21:46.637
All pross—related.

21:47.140 --> 21:50.348
Soliciting, loitering...
Going back to '69.

21:50.470 --> 21:54.179
Nothing in the last six years or so.
Call those "the California years."

21:54.270 --> 21:57.148
You heard Constantine caught one
last night too, right?

21:57.230 --> 21:59.300
- In a car. West 27th?
- Yep.

21:59.730 --> 22:00.810
What's that looking like?

22:01.150 --> 22:02.219
Mob related.

22:02.480 --> 22:03.811
Gambino ties.

22:04.150 --> 22:06.357
The summer heat's starting
to get to everybody.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.270
It's always like that in August.

22:08.450 --> 22:10.190
And not a taxpayer in the bunch.

22:10.280 --> 22:13.784
Just us, picking up the trash,
misdemeanor homicides.

22:13.870 --> 22:15.246
Son of a bitch.

22:16.330 --> 22:17.319
I knew her.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.490
Went by the name Ashley.

22:20.960 --> 22:23.952
Must've tossed her in the ho wagon
two dozen times.

22:24.050 --> 22:25.756
Yeah? Well, it didn't take.

22:34.350 --> 22:35.920
Front end out.

22:36.020 --> 22:37.885
You pull into
a parking space front end in,

22:37.980 --> 22:40.141
every boss will be beating you
like a red-headed stepchild.

22:44.360 --> 22:47.602
- Detective.
- I'll shadow Goldman for you.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.565
You been on me to do it, and I will.

22:50.030 --> 22:51.190
But I have conditions.

22:51.580 --> 22:52.865
No doubt, Detective.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.582
If you're looking for work,
you going have to wait on Bobby.

23:02.670 --> 23:05.002
Ain't no guarantee,
given your history here.

23:05.880 --> 23:07.757
That was fucking years ago.

23:08.380 --> 23:10.007
He's like a elephant. He don't forget.

23:11.050 --> 23:12.597
I'm management, too.

23:12.930 --> 23:15.842
Name's Joseph,
but, uh, you can call me Joey.

23:16.390 --> 23:17.379
Management?

23:17.480 --> 23:21.473
Melissa. I can start now if you guys
are down a girl or something.

23:21.560 --> 23:24.313
Joey, this girl and your father
have history in this place.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.891
I stole from a john.
Got barred from all the parlors.

23:26.990 --> 23:28.946
But that was forever and a day ago.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.982
So, you're, um... You're Bobby's boy.

23:32.370 --> 23:34.361
-Mmmmmm.
- How old are you?

23:35.870 --> 23:36.939
Twenty-fou r.

23:37.870 --> 23:40.077
Melissa, why don't I buy you dinner

23:40.170 --> 23:42.707
and we figure out
how to put the past behind us, huh?

23:42.790 --> 23:45.122
I mean, everyone deserves
a second chance.

23:47.510 --> 23:49.375
You don't look 24, Joey.

23:49.470 --> 23:51.461
Everyone says that. It's so weird.

23:52.970 --> 23:54.631
So, what do you like to eat, huh?

23:56.140 --> 23:57.346
Um...

23:57.930 --> 23:59.477
Steak, Joey.

23:59.850 --> 24:01.135
Or lobster, maybe?

24:02.400 --> 24:04.186
How about both?

24:04.270 --> 24:05.567
Cool.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.486
But they like that.

24:12.570 --> 24:14.401
Oh, no, no. Right place, wrong time.

24:14.490 --> 24:16.446
No, ladies, no hassle tonight.

24:16.740 --> 24:17.946
Promise.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.956
- We need some help.
- Come on.

24:21.410 --> 24:22.616
Help?

24:31.090 --> 24:32.796
Was she on the stroll?

24:34.300 --> 24:35.540
I don't know her.

24:39.060 --> 24:41.096
Did she have a man out here?

24:41.180 --> 24:42.977
Anyone see her get into a car
the last couple weeks?

24:43.060 --> 24:45.608
- You guys ain't Vice?
- Homicide.

24:48.480 --> 24:50.277
She's dead?

24:52.570 --> 24:56.233
What's the word on the street?
Any bad johns the girls are avondlng?

24:58.490 --> 25:00.117
She wasn't a whore.

25:02.710 --> 25:05.918
You saying you knew her?
Where do you think you're going?

25:09.800 --> 25:12.121
I tell you, nothing was there
when we came in.

25:13.510 --> 25:14.716
What's this one about?

25:14.800 --> 25:16.085
- Nothing.
- Damn right.

25:16.180 --> 25:17.920
Like I been saying...

25:19.390 --> 25:22.302
Girl, just back up. Let me see it.

25:28.020 --> 25:30.523
- What the fuck?
- It ain't yours.

25:32.440 --> 25:34.237
Who wrote you a check?

25:35.160 --> 25:37.276
- It's from me working...
- It's from what?

25:37.370 --> 25:38.826
It's from me working on my thing.

25:38.910 --> 25:40.070
Your thing? What's your thing?

25:40.160 --> 25:42.151
I'm a salesgirl. I sell clothes.

25:42.660 --> 25:44.036
You sell what?

25:44.500 --> 25:46.912
What I make with you,
I share with you.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.537
What I make on my own is mine.

25:56.470 --> 26:00.133
When did you get a straight job?

26:08.060 --> 26:09.300
What the...

26:09.730 --> 26:12.472
Piece of shit. Motherfucker!

26:12.940 --> 26:13.929
Fuck.

26:16.910 --> 26:17.979
Fuck you!

26:19.530 --> 26:20.940
Piece of shit!

26:27.500 --> 26:29.661
What the fuck is going on around here?

26:29.750 --> 26:30.990
You killed her.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.376
- What?
- You killed Ashley.

26:33.510 --> 26:35.080
I ain't kill anyone.

26:35.170 --> 26:37.081
You're the fucking pimps, you did it.

26:37.180 --> 26:39.466
Bitch, I don't know what the fuck
you talking about.

26:39.550 --> 26:40.539
Ashley got killed?

26:42.760 --> 26:45.729
Let me up!

26:55.440 --> 26:58.819
I ain't had shit to do
with anybody getting killed.

26:59.490 --> 27:02.732
And if Ashley dead,
you might want to think on

27:02.830 --> 27:04.479
who had it out for that girl.

27:05.410 --> 27:07.401
Or who ain't been around
in a good while.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.628
Yeah. Could be CO in the wind
for a reason.

27:10.710 --> 27:12.530
What's the fucking difference?

27:12.630 --> 27:15.042
- What are you saying?
- Ashley is dead?

27:15.130 --> 27:16.620
Who's Ashley?

27:18.050 --> 27:19.176
Loretta. . .

27:19.930 --> 27:21.636
I'm fucking done with this.

27:23.850 --> 27:25.556
I'm fucking done with it.

27:48.040 --> 27:52.875
Only, uh, three years old,
and $1,600 new.

27:52.960 --> 27:54.496
And already this thing's a fucking...

27:55.170 --> 27:56.546
it's a fucking stegosaurus.

27:56.630 --> 27:58.791
Now, behold...

28:00.130 --> 28:01.506
The future.

28:02.680 --> 28:07.629
This is a new Panasonic prototype
that they're gonna market next year,

28:07.720 --> 28:10.553
I think for less than a thousand
retail, and that's top of the line.

28:10.890 --> 28:14.474
Artie Morowitz brought this back
from the CES show in Chicago.

28:17.690 --> 28:18.930
It's just you,

28:19.030 --> 28:22.022
in the privacy of your own home,
doing whatever you wanna do

28:22.110 --> 28:25.489
when you're watching people fucking
on your own television set.

28:26.870 --> 28:29.612
Look. Look at this shit, Okay?

28:29.830 --> 28:32.116
You can watch it again and again.

28:32.210 --> 28:33.996
You can go backwards.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.833
There. Or forwards.

28:37.500 --> 28:40.469
Huh? And the old in-and-out

28:40.550 --> 28:42.927
becomes the old out-and-in.

28:44.010 --> 28:47.252
Like I said,
this is the future for us,

28:47.430 --> 28:49.637
which means that, uh, today,

28:49.720 --> 28:51.802
you're gonna go back into editing
and put together trailers

28:51.890 --> 28:54.597
for .
P/easure Pr/son
.and .
Touch /n the /V/ght.

28:55.110 --> 28:57.010
- What for?
- Well, we're gonna

28:57.110 --> 28:59.567
stick 'em on every videotape
of
Red Hot
that we sell.

28:59.650 --> 29:02.483
"Other titles also available

29:02.570 --> 29:04.561
- "from HW International Films."
- Yeah.

29:04.660 --> 29:06.776
We are gonna tease our backlist
on every video.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.440
Yeah, if they're
mail-ordering for one,

29:08.540 --> 29:10.360
they're probably in the market
for more movies.

29:10.450 --> 29:12.611
- That makes a lot of sense.
- And it's not just mail order.

29:12.870 --> 29:16.829
Morowitz is opening up a store
for videos on 47th.

29:17.170 --> 29:19.297
Hmm? Yeah. You walk
right up to the counter.

29:19.380 --> 29:21.666
They sell you any title
that goes to videotape.

29:21.760 --> 29:26.584
I think it's like $100
a unit for VHS, 90 for Beta?

29:26.680 --> 29:28.671
For one? People are gonna pay that?

29:28.760 --> 29:30.762
For porn in the privacy
of their own homes,

29:30.850 --> 29:32.841
people are gonna sell their children.

29:34.560 --> 29:38.189
And hey, uh, I also need
a 45-second c//,'o from
Red Hot.

29:38.270 --> 29:41.683
Okay? No sex. Just people
walking and talking, whatever,

29:41.780 --> 29:44.021
while fully-clothed.

29:44.110 --> 29:45.737
What for?

29:45.820 --> 29:48.527
For Jack l/a/ance. 0n
Late ill/ght.

29:49.370 --> 29:51.326
- What?
- They booked you as a guest.

29:51.700 --> 29:53.452
- No. Fuck you.
- Well...

29:53.540 --> 29:56.532
"The feminist auteur_
who made a porn classm."

29:57.130 --> 29:58.586
And they're willing to let you
show a clip,

29:58.670 --> 30:01.412
so long as it meets network standards.

30:01.920 --> 30:04.332
I am going on network television

30:04.920 --> 30:06.751
to fuckin' sell porn?

30:07.010 --> 30:08.466
O brave new world.

30:10.680 --> 30:14.013
Valance's bookers would like you
to do a pre-interview,

30:14.850 --> 30:16.727
okay, Candy Renee?

30:17.600 --> 30:19.648
You're what's known in this business
as a "good get."

30:21.270 --> 30:23.226
Mack here tells me
that you can be trusted...

30:23.320 --> 30:24.935
...that we can rely on you.

30:25.030 --> 30:26.691
- Sir?
- Look,

30:26.780 --> 30:29.487
the department is going all-in
with the Midtown partnership.

30:29.570 --> 30:31.902
We want it to work. But...

30:32.830 --> 30:34.149
We don't want to be surprised.

30:34.450 --> 30:36.611
We need to know where the thing
is going before it gets there.

30:36.710 --> 30:38.530
If we need _
to clean something up, fine.

30:38.630 --> 30:40.916
You give us the word,
you'll give us a chance.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.547
Don't hang the department
out in public.

30:42.630 --> 30:45.542
And if someone with some pull down
at City Hall is gonna be targeted,

30:45.630 --> 30:47.871
_ some landlord
or holding company or whatever,

30:48.220 --> 30:49.756
we want to know who
we're biting in the ass.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.922
We'll make the enemies
if we have to, sure,

30:52.010 --> 30:54.592
but let us know in advance
so we can protect ourselves.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.089
Now, what do you need?

30:58.900 --> 31:01.642
I need you to shuffle most of
the Vice plainclothes out of Midtown,

31:02.190 --> 31:04.818
especially the guys in Public Morals
and the task force.

31:05.740 --> 31:08.197
I can't do this if I gotta
wade through the usual shit.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.149
Anything else?

31:11.370 --> 31:13.361
Respectfully, sir, I'll let you know.

31:13.660 --> 31:15.571
You do that, Sergeant Alston.

31:15.660 --> 31:16.900
My door is open to you.

31:17.750 --> 31:19.320
Congratulations on making rank.

31:20.920 --> 31:23.286
Sir, I'm nowhere near the top
of the sergeant's list.

31:23.380 --> 31:24.699
You are now.

31:28.590 --> 31:30.330
She can ’t heio you now, gir/.

31:30.890 --> 31:31.879
You mine.

31:31.970 --> 31:34.803
No, I... I don't like that.

31:35.220 --> 31:38.303
Try to find something on 8th Avenue
with Larry and Lori.

31:38.390 --> 31:40.767
Maybe the second chase sequence?

31:41.690 --> 31:43.180
So, omitting the skin,
maybe in the doorway or...

31:43.270 --> 31:44.931
- Yes. Yeah.
- Okay.

31:46.440 --> 31:48.146
Eileen? Um, about...

31:48.900 --> 31:51.027
About the other night,
with those guys, um...

31:51.530 --> 31:52.736
Yeah. Fuck you, Russell.

31:53.200 --> 31:55.111
Um, just... It's...

31:56.330 --> 31:57.786
That's not how I think of us.

31:59.580 --> 32:00.740
No, really, fuck you.

32:02.540 --> 32:03.586
And fuck me, too.

32:05.210 --> 32:06.700
You know, I settled for us,

32:08.210 --> 32:09.791
'cause I thought you were safe for me.

32:10.590 --> 32:12.638
You're in the business.
You know what we do.

32:13.220 --> 32:14.426
You know what's real...

32:15.850 --> 32:16.885
And what's not real.

32:17.810 --> 32:19.766
So, you know, I thought I could
let my guard down a little,

32:19.850 --> 32:23.229
not have to worry someone
was pretending to fuck Eileen

32:24.690 --> 32:26.760
when Candy was the only one
in his bed.

32:28.360 --> 32:30.021
I know. I don't...

32:30.110 --> 32:32.567
Like, I know these guys
from back in the day, and I was...

32:33.490 --> 32:36.527
I got caught up in trying
to impress them, but...

32:36.910 --> 32:38.116
Yeah.

32:38.410 --> 32:41.402
It's stupid, and I'm sorry.

32:44.750 --> 32:45.956
Yeah, anything you got
in my apartment,

32:46.040 --> 32:47.166
I'll throw in a bag for you.

32:49.380 --> 32:52.463
Start on that mid-shot of Lori,
coming out of the subway.

32:52.550 --> 32:53.630
We'll go from there.

33:00.850 --> 33:01.976
Oh...

33:09.480 --> 33:10.526
You kiddin' me?

33:12.240 --> 33:13.525
That kind of money
for the East Village?

33:13.610 --> 33:16.989
Theater in the West Village or even
Chelsea'd be three times the rent.

33:17.080 --> 33:19.617
For what you have to spend,
be thankful this is still Manhattan.

33:19.700 --> 33:20.906
Oof.

33:23.500 --> 33:25.707
He's gone, okay?

33:25.790 --> 33:28.338
He is not coming back for you, Lori.

33:28.590 --> 33:30.831
He is gone for good.

33:30.920 --> 33:33.377
- He was paid to go.
- You don't know him.

33:33.720 --> 33:34.755
You don't.

33:35.430 --> 33:37.170
He's gonna come back for me,
you'll see.

33:37.260 --> 33:38.670
This is fucking crazy.

33:38.760 --> 33:41.968
The people I work with,
they bought him out.

33:42.060 --> 33:43.095
He took the money.

33:44.890 --> 33:46.801
Doesn't matter.

33:48.860 --> 33:52.148
Look, whatever you left at his crib,

33:52.530 --> 33:53.599
we can replace it,

33:53.700 --> 33:56.066
and for now,
you can keep on staying with me.

33:56.160 --> 33:57.696
I am fine with that.

33:58.570 --> 33:59.980
But come Friday,

34:00.450 --> 34:03.829
you are going to get on that plane
and go to LA

34:03.910 --> 34:05.286
and do the LA premiere,

34:05.370 --> 34:08.032
and the publicity they have scheduled.

34:08.130 --> 34:09.415
We're committed.

34:09.500 --> 34:11.991
I'm not gonna go until he says I can.

34:12.590 --> 34:13.716
I'm not.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.177
Jesus, Lori!

34:16.590 --> 34:18.797
This is so fucking paranoid.

34:20.720 --> 34:22.210
How much coke are you doing?

34:22.770 --> 34:24.670
You don't understand.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.220
So, how is it going
with my sister?

34:30.060 --> 34:31.061
Fine.

34:31.650 --> 34:32.856
Oh.

34:33.110 --> 34:34.316
Thanks for makin' it happen.

34:35.900 --> 34:37.356
Nadine is worried you are unhappy.

34:37.660 --> 34:41.619
Me? No, I just had a thing yesterday.

34:41.950 --> 34:43.235
Yeah, she told me.

34:51.500 --> 34:52.876
You know what, Renton?

34:54.460 --> 34:55.586
I ain't gonna lie to you.

34:59.300 --> 35:01.256
You don't deserve that,
you really don't.

35:02.310 --> 35:03.299
You are lying?

35:04.680 --> 35:06.341
I'm not telling the truth,
that's for damn sure.

35:19.740 --> 35:21.230
You could do better for yourself.

35:21.870 --> 35:22.859
Excuse me?

35:23.120 --> 35:24.155
Way better.

35:25.500 --> 35:28.287
I slept with men for money.

35:30.920 --> 35:31.989
I did it for years.

35:32.590 --> 35:35.241
And I've been in movies,
dirty-ass movies.

35:36.260 --> 35:38.626
The guy yesterday,
he recognized me from the movies,

35:38.720 --> 35:41.632
and, I don't know,
I just lost my shit when he did.

35:44.470 --> 35:45.550
So now you know.

35:47.640 --> 35:48.720
But it's a job.

35:49.810 --> 35:50.845
And I did it.

35:52.560 --> 35:54.516
- Do you still?
- Less and less.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.390
Why you think I took the job
with your sister?

36:01.990 --> 36:03.526
It's hard to get past it all,
ain't it?

36:16.800 --> 36:17.915
Come to class.

36:29.140 --> 36:30.801
Feels like
something's turned.

36:30.890 --> 36:33.472
- How so?
- I don't know, I just...

36:34.810 --> 36:37.608
I always thought of us...
You know, me and mine...

36:39.530 --> 36:40.519
This is gonna sound stupid,

36:40.610 --> 36:43.602
but I always thought of us
as being good people.

36:44.780 --> 36:46.156
What, we ain't?

36:46.870 --> 36:48.155
Maybe all the assholes in the world,

36:48.240 --> 36:50.572
they go through life thinkin'
that they're not assholes.

36:51.410 --> 36:54.538
They think they're right people,
and they're not.

36:55.170 --> 36:56.626
That's a part of being an asshole.

36:58.250 --> 36:59.330
That's what I'm sayin'.

37:01.300 --> 37:02.335
Ah.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.006
These motherfuckers,

37:07.220 --> 37:09.632
they come to me tomorrow,
and they tell me to do you.

37:10.600 --> 37:11.726
What do I say?

37:11.810 --> 37:14.643
What do you say if they come to you,
tell you to do me?

37:15.060 --> 37:16.140
What do you think?

37:19.360 --> 37:21.601
- I think we're not assholes.
- No.

37:25.240 --> 37:26.525
But you can never be sure, right?

37:34.370 --> 37:35.576
Check, one, two.

37:39.960 --> 37:41.450
Boy, am I glad to see you.

37:42.300 --> 37:43.460
Where has our girl been?

38:06.820 --> 38:08.026
Check, one, two.

38:13.250 --> 38:15.957
Ah... Classics.

38:17.040 --> 38:18.029
Vincent.

38:19.960 --> 38:21.040
Ah.

38:24.920 --> 38:26.000
Yeah?

38:28.180 --> 38:29.215
Uh-huh.

38:31.390 --> 38:32.709
All right. Stay there.

38:33.270 --> 38:34.305
Stay there.

38:36.230 --> 38:37.345
Hey. Get up.

38:38.060 --> 38:39.049
Pour us something.

38:40.360 --> 38:41.850
Ianniello, wha...

38:43.570 --> 38:44.776
You fellas can wait outside.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.025
- Pour.
- Yeah.

38:47.570 --> 38:48.559
All right.

38:49.240 --> 38:52.403
Is there something, uh...
What... What can I do?

38:52.990 --> 38:54.116
Do you know this gentleman?

38:54.750 --> 38:57.492
Uh... I'm sorry, I... How do you do?

38:57.580 --> 38:59.912
- I'm good.
- His name is Rudy Pipilo,

39:00.170 --> 39:01.455
and you should fuckin' know him.

39:01.920 --> 39:03.831
He happens to own 25% of your movie.

39:04.420 --> 39:07.628
But what's really confusing to me is,
I own 90% of it.

39:07.880 --> 39:08.926
How much is that?

39:09.300 --> 39:10.631
Hundred and fifteen percent.

39:11.970 --> 39:13.597
Add on the 10% for you and yours,

39:13.680 --> 39:15.921
if this thing ever sees
a fuckin' profit.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.260
How much does that make, Harvey?

39:17.350 --> 39:18.385
A hundred and a quarter.

39:18.730 --> 39:21.802
How... How do you...
How do you have...

39:21.900 --> 39:24.721
Frankie Martino sold me a quarter
for 20 grand.

39:25.820 --> 39:27.481
He didn't tell you
where the cash came from?

39:27.570 --> 39:28.639
He, uh...

39:32.740 --> 39:34.287
You dumb fuckin' sheeny.

39:34.540 --> 39:35.905
Do you realize what you've done?

39:37.000 --> 39:39.742
You sold the same movie to two capos,

39:40.210 --> 39:43.031
one Gambino, and one Genovese.

39:43.590 --> 39:44.579
It's true.

39:44.960 --> 39:46.291
We don't even like each other.

39:47.050 --> 39:48.210
We really don't.

40:06.190 --> 40:07.225
Hey.

40:12.530 --> 40:14.612
- You were right.
- No.

40:15.740 --> 40:16.900
The pimps.

40:17.330 --> 40:19.150
CO, I know it was him.

40:20.040 --> 40:21.075
Look.

40:22.170 --> 40:24.161
- This isn't your fault.
- Hell, no.

40:24.500 --> 40:25.706
This isn't about you.

40:25.800 --> 40:26.915
I should have stopped it.

40:27.380 --> 40:28.449
Shit, how?

40:29.590 --> 40:32.002
This is about Ashley
and what she couldn't shake.

40:33.390 --> 40:34.755
That damage don't lie.

40:37.890 --> 40:38.879
Come on.

41:24.060 --> 41:25.095
Darlene.

41:29.190 --> 41:30.771
You ain't gonna say
goodbye or nothin'?

41:35.530 --> 41:36.770
It's easier this way.

41:43.870 --> 41:45.076
Thing is,

41:45.170 --> 41:47.206
you should've never let me
see you act, Larry.

41:48.960 --> 41:50.621
Once you showed me that,
you showed me everything.

41:52.260 --> 41:53.295
How you mean?

41:53.920 --> 41:55.217
Pimp is a role.

41:56.090 --> 41:57.170
So is whore.

41:58.220 --> 42:00.757
You pretended to be one,
I pretended to be the other,

42:00.850 --> 42:02.590
and we went on like that for years.

42:03.270 --> 42:04.385
You know, pretendin'.

42:05.060 --> 42:06.300
But shit,

42:06.400 --> 42:08.641
once you start lettin' a girl
inside the pretend,

42:09.690 --> 42:11.271
it's over, ain't it?

42:13.280 --> 42:14.315
Besides...

42:15.280 --> 42:17.817
Your heart ain't been in pimpin'
for a long while now.

42:26.170 --> 42:27.239
So this is it, then?

42:28.460 --> 42:29.495
Yeah.

42:31.590 --> 42:33.126
A lot of years, Darlene.

42:35.090 --> 42:36.671
We might not ever
see each other again.

42:43.640 --> 42:44.766
I do this right,

42:45.600 --> 42:47.306
we sure as hell will not.

43:14.300 --> 43:17.542
This same caliber, but more than six.

43:18.800 --> 43:19.880
You know how to use semi-auto?

43:22.810 --> 43:23.879
It's all good.

43:24.520 --> 43:26.806
Just remember there's one in the
chamber after you rack the slide.

43:28.230 --> 43:29.891
I can probably do 60 a day
for that one,

43:30.270 --> 43:31.305
another ten for bullets.

43:34.980 --> 43:37.528
Gonna come get you in five minutes.

43:37.610 --> 43:39.487
You need anything?
Hair and makeup touch-up?

43:41.030 --> 43:42.941
- You tell me.
- You look good.

43:43.870 --> 43:47.192
Hearst huﬂt
a castle there. You should go see it.

43:47.500 --> 43:49.149
Yeah, next time
I’m in the neighborhood

43:49.250 --> 43:50.365
I’// be sure to stop by.

43:53.250 --> 43:55.081
Christ, this place is all class.

43:55.170 --> 43:56.205
Mmm-hmm.

43:56.300 --> 43:58.791
- What's the overhead?
- Higher than usual.

43:58.880 --> 44:00.711
I'm still clearing
two or three a week.

44:01.180 --> 44:02.329
So you're set.

44:04.010 --> 44:06.592
- Why call us now?
- I need cash now.

44:07.270 --> 44:09.170
For one thing, I wanna
buy out my partner in this.

44:09.270 --> 44:12.228
He risked everything,
now he needs to move on, I owe him.

44:13.150 --> 44:14.765
And for another,
I got a new opportunity.

44:15.190 --> 44:16.976
- What's that?
- A theater.

44:17.650 --> 44:19.948
- Like for movies?
- Nah. For plays.

44:20.400 --> 44:21.606
Hmm.

44:22.410 --> 44:25.368
- Money in that?
- Not a dime, that I can tell.

44:27.370 --> 44:29.247
How much?

44:30.540 --> 44:33.498
Seventy-five. But here's the thing.

44:33.580 --> 44:36.663
IfI can pay Rudy that back,
with a fair vig within the year,

44:36.750 --> 44:37.830
I want to get clear.

44:39.090 --> 44:41.297
Yeah, it doesn't work that way.

44:41.380 --> 44:44.634
- Yeah.
- Look, Rudy's not greedy.

44:45.180 --> 44:47.842
- He won't bust you out. You know this.
-Mmmmmm.

44:48.520 --> 44:50.590
But if we're in, we're in for the run.

44:55.520 --> 44:56.566
Yeah.

44:57.270 --> 44:59.932
I understand that you not only
directed the movie,

45:00.030 --> 45:01.349
but you also acted in it.

45:01.450 --> 45:03.691
What was it like directing yourself?

45:04.490 --> 45:05.616
Oh.

45:06.330 --> 45:07.319
Um...

45:07.410 --> 45:11.153
I mean, did you make the cast
do take after take

45:11.250 --> 45:13.070
until you were satisfied?

45:15.290 --> 45:16.496
Um...

45:16.590 --> 45:19.127
My cast was really talented,

45:19.210 --> 45:22.088
and it was an honor to work with them.

45:22.170 --> 45:23.797
Oh, come on, lighten up.

45:23.880 --> 45:26.098
It's an adult movie,
not an Oscar contender.

45:26.180 --> 45:28.250
I... I know, but I...

45:28.350 --> 45:31.092
Just because we're depicting
human sexuality,

45:31.480 --> 45:34.517
that doesn't mean you can assume
that we're not professionals

45:34.600 --> 45:36.181
or that we don't have a story to tell.

45:36.270 --> 45:39.228
R/ght and we a// read
P/ayboy
for the interviews.

46:04.760 --> 46:06.250
Give it. Give it all.

46:06.340 --> 46:08.217
Time safe. It's a time safe.

46:11.350 --> 46:13.170
You stupid...

46:13.270 --> 46:15.226
Get up, motherfucker! Get up!

46:15.890 --> 46:17.596
Look what you made me do, huh?

46:19.230 --> 46:20.436
Shit!

46:25.280 --> 46:26.486
Fuck this!

46:42.420 --> 46:44.468
Well, that was no fun at all.

46:45.050 --> 46:47.541
- Oh, no?
- Everybody had their clothes on.

46:48.140 --> 46:51.177
I remember when we used to collar her
twme a week on the stroll.

46:51.810 --> 46:54.017
Now she's swapping spit on talk shows.

46:54.100 --> 46:55.636
Hmm. Good for her.

46:57.480 --> 46:58.970
Hey.

46:59.060 --> 47:01.108
Units be advised
there ’5 a 1 0-30 in progress.

47:01.190 --> 47:02.600
- That's us.
- All right, let's roll.

47:03.110 --> 47:04.350
Tenth and 44th Street

47:05.990 --> 47:08.151
- What was the address on that?
- Pharmacy on 10th.

47:08.660 --> 47:09.900
All right. You comin'?

47:10.530 --> 47:11.576
For what?

47:17.250 --> 47:18.365
Save my stool, will ya?

47:50.320 --> 47:51.309
Fuck!

47:53.200 --> 47:54.531
Hey. Hey, where's your partner?

47:54.620 --> 47:56.156
- Covering the back.
- No, no. Go find him.

47:56.250 --> 47:57.956
I got this till backup comes,
then we'll go in.

47:58.290 --> 47:59.325
Go.

48:07.760 --> 48:08.749
Shay!

48:09.170 --> 48:10.376
Shay, we clear out there?

48:11.510 --> 48:12.636
Shay!

48:27.480 --> 48:28.481
Rodney?

48:29.030 --> 48:30.145
Are you kidding me?

48:30.780 --> 48:32.236
Fuck you, Haddix.

48:39.410 --> 48:40.490
Detective on scene!

48:45.000 --> 48:45.989
- You okay?
- Yeah.

48:46.090 --> 48:47.125
Somebody call the bus.

48:47.210 --> 48:48.837
I spilled my fuckin' beer.

48:49.630 --> 48:51.586
- Detective, you okay?
- Ah...

48:52.760 --> 48:54.887
- Hey, move it, move it!
- Back, people, back.

48:54.970 --> 48:57.598
Lori Madison is losing
her coke-addled mind

48:57.680 --> 48:59.307
at the idea that her pimp

48:59.390 --> 49:02.097
is hiding behind every lamppost
waiting to jump her.

49:02.350 --> 49:05.683
Kiki Raines says she won't get
on a plane for the LA premiere

49:05.770 --> 49:07.510
unless C.C. says she can.

49:07.940 --> 49:09.430
C.C. ain't gonna say shit.

49:10.070 --> 49:11.947
Well, someone needs
to convince Lori of that.

49:14.110 --> 49:16.738
Yeah, it's on me. I... I'll do it.

49:17.120 --> 49:19.748
Second, and much more of a problem.

49:21.910 --> 49:24.743
I've been informed that
we sold pieces of
Red hot

49:24.830 --> 49:26.661
to two different Mafia families?

49:27.380 --> 49:29.200
All right, what... So who's cryin'?

49:29.300 --> 49:31.586
I mean, the movie's gonna make money,
then we all make money.

49:32.090 --> 49:33.296
You don't fuckin' get it.

49:33.930 --> 49:36.842
The only thing these guys like
to do more than cheat each other

49:36.930 --> 49:38.056
is cheat other people.

49:38.140 --> 49:40.882
I thought you won that cash in a bet,
Frankie. Yeah.

49:41.390 --> 49:43.597
Yeah, now these dagos
are gonna compete with each other

49:43.690 --> 49:45.806
to see which one of 'em
can screw us over more.

49:45.900 --> 49:47.299
No, no, no.

49:47.400 --> 49:50.062
I got my own money
in this movie, all right?

49:50.360 --> 49:54.239
And Candy, she's got her guy
out in LA, he threw in.

49:54.320 --> 49:56.106
He's fucked. And so are you.

49:56.200 --> 49:57.770
Hey, that's not fair, Harvey.

49:57.870 --> 50:01.829
I'm not telling you what's fair,
dearest, I'm telling you what is. I...

50:03.000 --> 50:05.070
Look, yeah, sure,
if we keep our heads down

50:05.170 --> 50:06.706
and the movie does the business
that it should,

50:06.790 --> 50:09.497
sure, maybe they'll peel off
a little back end for you, Frankie.

50:09.590 --> 50:11.330
Yeah, maybe they'll even
give me a little taste

50:11.420 --> 50:12.705
of what oughta be my cut!

50:13.550 --> 50:14.676
Maybe not!

50:17.180 --> 50:19.296
Boy, you're awfully quiet over there,
Miss Merrell.

50:20.220 --> 50:21.209
What say you?

50:25.640 --> 50:27.471
Looks like we're gonna
make them some money.

50:29.020 --> 50:30.226
And they're gonna make me a name.

50:31.190 --> 50:33.932
I'm gonna take that name
and I'm gonna use it

50:34.190 --> 50:36.488
to raise money for the next picture
without them,

50:36.570 --> 50:38.026
and then the next one.

50:39.200 --> 50:40.576
So fuck it.

50:42.990 --> 50:44.036
Hey, Harvey.

50:45.410 --> 50:46.411
Harvey.

50:48.460 --> 50:49.779
This is just money.

50:51.040 --> 50:52.166
It's just money.

50:52.250 --> 50:53.877
What we do is not goin' away.

50:54.970 --> 50:56.005
Not ever.

50:58.430 --> 51:00.295
Hey, you were good on TV last night.

51:01.390 --> 51:04.211
No, I was the butt
of that asshole's jokes.

51:06.230 --> 51:07.595
But I'm not goin' away, either.

51:12.360 --> 51:13.520
Fuck.

51:14.570 --> 51:15.685
You awake?

51:18.990 --> 51:20.230
I made some calls.

51:21.070 --> 51:24.198
Take care of things for Ashley.

51:26.830 --> 51:28.570
Dorothy.

51:29.460 --> 51:30.449
What do you mean?

51:31.500 --> 51:32.956
I claimed her from the city.

51:36.300 --> 51:37.585
I'll do what needs doin'.

51:42.430 --> 51:43.556
Do you want to go out there?

51:59.360 --> 52:00.440
- Hey.
- Hey.

52:05.540 --> 52:06.609
How's she doin'?

52:08.750 --> 52:09.819
This a bad idea?

52:10.540 --> 52:12.747
No. No, just, um...

52:14.250 --> 52:15.456
Why don't you spend
some time with her,

52:15.550 --> 52:18.041
I'm gonna go take care
of some things. All right?

52:18.130 --> 52:20.086
- Yeah. Mmm-hmm.
- Thank you.

52:30.190 --> 52:31.179
Ding dong.

52:34.860 --> 52:35.895
Why are you here?

52:37.230 --> 52:38.982
The fuck do you think? I need a job.

52:40.610 --> 52:42.066
You think I can go back to trickin'

52:42.160 --> 52:46.733
now that Dorothy fuckin' Spina
decided to die for my sins,

52:46.830 --> 52:49.037
you've lost whatever's left
of your mind.

52:49.660 --> 52:50.900
She screwed me good.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.036
Now I gotta clean glasses
and spill liquor

52:53.120 --> 52:55.031
in that dive you call a bar.

53:01.260 --> 53:03.216
There's no fixing this world,
is there?

53:07.220 --> 53:08.209
I don't know.

53:09.470 --> 53:12.883
Whatever it is,
it's bigger than some pimps,

53:13.650 --> 53:16.858
and it's bigger than all the whores
and all the johns.

53:17.980 --> 53:21.529
It's something to do with how
our brains work, or don't.

53:25.370 --> 53:26.439
What do you mean?

53:28.700 --> 53:30.827
I don't know what the fuck I mean.
I'm not that smart.

53:31.410 --> 53:33.492
Hmm.

53:34.540 --> 53:37.282
But, shit, maybe you'll figure it out.

53:37.380 --> 53:38.449
Hmm.

53:41.840 --> 53:43.000
I'll help ifI can.

53:45.760 --> 53:46.840
Hmm.

54:06.410 --> 54:07.399
Hello?

54:14.290 --> 54:16.872
Hey, who wants to go on vacation?

54:26.680 --> 54:27.795
Hi, Dad.

54:52.200 --> 54:54.191
- Is Adam here?
- He's not going with you.

54:56.410 --> 54:57.411
Ma.

55:03.130 --> 55:05.667
I... I promised him the beach.

55:05.760 --> 55:07.000
I don't care what you promised him.

55:07.090 --> 55:09.502
He's not goin', and you're not welcome
in this house.

55:09.590 --> 55:11.342
- Dad--
- How'd you think it would be for him?

55:11.430 --> 55:13.967
What do you think happens in a
schoolyard when everything gets said?

55:14.060 --> 55:15.049
Why, did something happen?

55:15.140 --> 55:16.971
When you tell the whole world
who you are?

55:20.110 --> 55:21.225
Fuck you.

55:22.820 --> 55:24.890
Because you don't have any idea...

56:04.320 --> 56:05.389
Hey, Dad.

56:12.950 --> 56:13.985
Dad.

56:57.660 --> 56:59.287
So, what'd you want
to talk to me about?

57:04.670 --> 57:05.705
He's dead.

57:07.960 --> 57:09.541
C.C. He's dead.

57:15.220 --> 57:16.346
How do you know?

57:17.510 --> 57:18.590
I know.

57:19.430 --> 57:20.886
I saw him. Dead.

57:22.640 --> 57:23.686
You saw him?

57:25.190 --> 57:26.179
You were there?

57:29.570 --> 57:30.730
Why?

57:31.650 --> 57:32.856
Was it 'cause of me?

57:34.280 --> 57:35.736
- No.
- So, why?

57:40.870 --> 57:42.497
It just happened.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.161
- But...
- But he's not comin' back.

57:48.290 --> 57:49.450
That's what you need to know.

57:54.880 --> 57:55.960
Yeah.

58:00.680 --> 58:01.806
Yeah.

58:02.640 --> 58:03.766
Is everything good?

58:05.900 --> 58:07.356
I got some fresh coffee comin' up.

58:43.640 --> 58:45.301
I'll get your check for you.
Hold on, honey.

58:56.910 --> 59:00.027
You want some coffee? You want coffee?
All right, I got some decaf brewmg.

59:56.170 --> 59:57.546
. . . was shot in the line of duty.

59:57.630 --> 1:00:00.337
The 14-year veteran was admitted
to St. Vincent’s Hospital

1:00:00.430 --> 1:00:02.250
with a single gunshot wound
to the shoulder.

1:00:02.600 --> 1:00:03.669
Wh/le the...

1:00:04.350 --> 1:00:05.465
Take it you know the guy.

1:00:07.230 --> 1:00:10.393
That is the senior man
in Public Morals,

1:00:10.850 --> 1:00:12.977
and I had him a heartbeat away
from being transferred

1:00:13.060 --> 1:00:15.142
to some shithole precinct
in an outer borough.

1:00:15.610 --> 1:00:17.396
- And now?
- Now?

1:00:18.070 --> 1:00:20.061
He took one for the company.
He's a fuckin' hero.

1:00:20.320 --> 1:00:21.309
And if anyone says different,

1:00:21.410 --> 1:00:23.310
he just unbuttons his shirt
and shows 'em the scar.

1:00:24.620 --> 1:00:26.576
He fuckin' rules
where he stands.

1:00:26.660 --> 1:00:27.649
You're kidding me.

1:00:29.370 --> 1:00:30.746
God's a second-rate novelist.

1:00:31.460 --> 1:00:32.666
Truth is, Sergeant,

1:00:33.580 --> 1:00:35.081
I don't need you
to clean up the Deuce,

1:00:35.840 --> 1:00:37.455
or even clean up your own department.

1:00:37.760 --> 1:00:39.159
What I need is for you
to hold the line,

1:00:39.260 --> 1:00:40.670
and make sure it doesn't get worse.

1:00:41.180 --> 1:00:42.329
You give me that,

1:00:43.850 --> 1:00:45.135
and the money will do the rest.

1:00:47.970 --> 1:00:49.130
The future's now,

1:00:49.770 --> 1:00:52.398
and I'm gonna run these
sons of bitches right off this island.

1:00:53.480 --> 1:00:56.313
See the show,
three dancers on the stage now.

1:00:56.400 --> 1:00:58.311
All it costs is one quarter.

1:00:58.650 --> 1:01:01.528
Watch ’em, touch em,
taste ’em if you ’re lucky.

1:01:01.610 --> 1:01:03.350
Juicy pussy waitin ’ for ya.

1:01:03.950 --> 1:01:06.271
Show these girls what you got.

1:01:09.700 --> 1:01:12.203
You love somethin', set it free.

1:01:12.620 --> 1:01:15.669
If it comes back to you,
it's fucked up.

1:01:19.090 --> 1:01:21.968
Speakin' of which,
they told me you were back.

1:01:22.720 --> 1:01:24.631
What, you pay what you owe,
plus some vig?

1:01:24.720 --> 1:01:25.880
Manner of speakin'.

1:01:26.930 --> 1:01:30.843
They're fuckin' me out of
every last dollar I'm due on my movie.

1:01:31.390 --> 1:01:33.517
And Rudy, feelin' a little bit guilty,

1:01:34.150 --> 1:01:36.106
hands me back this fuckin' shithole.

1:01:36.520 --> 1:01:38.727
I mean,
motherfucker actually says to me,

1:01:38.820 --> 1:01:41.732
"Hey, try not to steal
so many quarters this time.

1:01:41.820 --> 1:01:43.310
"Just keep it within reason."

1:01:43.780 --> 1:01:44.849
Fuck.

1:01:47.910 --> 1:01:50.151
Nothin' shi_ttier _
than a consolation prize.

1:01:52.870 --> 1:01:53.996
Yeah.

1:02:01.760 --> 1:02:03.830
- Vince.
- Hey.

1:02:13.680 --> 1:02:15.932
Uh... Bobby.

1:02:17.360 --> 1:02:18.475
Uh...

1:02:18.980 --> 1:02:23.349
I was over at St. Gabriel
with Ashley.

1:02:23.780 --> 1:02:25.566
- You know.
- Yeah, okay.

1:02:26.490 --> 1:02:30.233
You, uh... You didn't put a stone down
for that other girl,

1:02:30.660 --> 1:02:31.649
what's-her-name.

1:02:37.420 --> 1:02:38.455
Shit.

1:02:38.960 --> 1:02:40.086
Yeah, I fuckin' forgot.

1:02:41.630 --> 1:02:43.166
I'll get it done, Vince. Sorry.

1:02:45.590 --> 1:02:46.966
We're better than this, Bobby.

1:02:48.510 --> 1:02:50.216
We can be better, you know?

1:02:56.560 --> 1:02:59.142
- Well, uh...
- Yeah, come on,

1:02:59.230 --> 1:03:00.470
everyone knows how to dance.

1:03:00.860 --> 1:03:03.397
All right. How 'bout a slow one?

1:03:03.730 --> 1:03:04.731
Yeah.

1:03:10.320 --> 1:03:13.448
This isn't slow, silly.

1:03:36.310 --> 1:03:38.187
Yes. Okay, uh...

1:03:41.190 --> 1:03:44.318
Can I see you guys in your position?
You look beautiful.

1:03:44.980 --> 1:03:46.060
I wanna see if there's a way we...

1:04:09.340 --> 1:04:12.423
That dump where all the
silly fools go, I should say not.

1:04:12.510 --> 1:04:15.388
Cut. We're gonna update that.
Nobody reads Kipling anymore.

1:04:53.390 --> 1:04:55.255
This rede ve/opment plan is cﬁ/ferent.

1:04:56.140 --> 1:04:59.052

strategies we wﬂl be deploying,

1:04:59.140 --> 1:05:02.689
[’0' Me to introduce the director of

If you gonna take my badge,
Captain Hall,

1:06:33.280 --> 1:06:34.395
you might as well do it now,

1:06:35.280 --> 1:06:38.738
'cause I ain't gonna stop
until I solve this case.

1:06:40.450 --> 1:06:42.577
Turned completely white, you know?

Hey, Vince.
