00:36.397 --> 00:39.950
Anybody want a piece of this
against my will?

00:40.018 --> 00:42.152
I won't <i>accuse</i> anyone.

00:42.220 --> 00:43.754
Okay, lady,
you've had enough.

00:43.821 --> 00:45.222
I want to hear it from him.

00:45.289 --> 00:47.357
You've probably
had enough.

00:48.943 --> 00:50.927
You are too big to punch.

01:13.317 --> 01:15.118
I did it perfectly.

01:17.505 --> 01:19.556
Stan?! What are
you doing here?

01:19.624 --> 01:21.074
You called me.
No, I didn't.

01:22.460 --> 01:24.010
ROGER
Stan, I'm at Shenanigans.

01:24.095 --> 01:26.296
I'm super-drunk
and about to get raped.

01:26.364 --> 01:29.483
Come pick me up in 45 minutes.

01:29.550 --> 01:32.219
Hey, I did call you
and I sound great.

01:32.286 --> 01:34.004
I should get
voice-over work.

01:34.072 --> 01:37.023
In a world where
vomit comes out of my mouth...

01:43.581 --> 01:47.517
Great, I tore my favorite suit
saving your drunk ass.

01:47.585 --> 01:49.953
Oh, please. You'd be
so bored without me.

01:50.021 --> 01:51.455
I would not.
You're annoying.

01:51.522 --> 01:54.174
Driving you home from bars,
cleaning up your messes,

01:54.242 --> 01:56.460
returning Somalian babies
you've adopted.

01:56.527 --> 01:58.845
Their little hands can
get stuff out of my butt.

01:58.913 --> 02:00.864
I don't know why I saved
your life last night.

02:00.932 --> 02:02.149
I should have let that bus
kill you.

02:02.216 --> 02:04.835
Wow, Dad!
You saved Roger's life?

02:04.886 --> 02:06.820
I guess you guys are even now.
"Even"?

02:06.888 --> 02:08.521
Yeah, you know, the life debt.

02:08.589 --> 02:10.190
Oh, right. Yeah. It's true.

02:10.258 --> 02:13.977
I understand, too, Hayley,
but would you explain it anyway?

02:14.045 --> 02:15.979
I love to hear things
summarized.

02:16.047 --> 02:18.081
Sure, Mom.
Years ago, Roger

02:18.149 --> 02:20.417
<i>was a prisoner in Area 51.</i>

02:20.485 --> 02:21.902
<i>He got loose and Dad</i>
<i>was the one who found him.</i>

02:24.355 --> 02:26.072
<i>Guards threw grenades</i>
<i>into the room.</i>

02:28.493 --> 02:30.894
<i>And Roger saved Dad's life.</i>

02:32.830 --> 02:35.365
Ever since then,
Dad's owed Roger a life debt,

02:35.433 --> 02:37.250
and that's why he lives with us.

02:37.318 --> 02:39.820
Hey, now that the debt's repaid,
he can move out.

02:39.887 --> 02:42.071
Klaus, the life debt
may be why Stan

02:42.123 --> 02:44.374
invited me to stay here
at first, but we all know

02:44.442 --> 02:46.409
he love me now and
wants me to be here.

02:46.477 --> 02:47.978
Nope, it's the life debt.

02:48.045 --> 02:50.063
It's always been the life debt
and now it's repaid.

02:50.131 --> 02:51.731
I don't owe you squat.

02:51.799 --> 02:53.233
Stan...
No.

02:53.301 --> 02:54.734
No, it's true.
He doesn't.

02:54.802 --> 02:57.370
And if that's how
you feel, Stan,

02:57.438 --> 02:59.639
maybe I should just move out.
Maybe you should.

02:59.707 --> 03:02.209
Fine, I'll move out today!
Great, see you.

03:02.276 --> 03:04.077
You'll miss me!

03:04.145 --> 03:06.913
I should have grabbed my
fanny pack instead of that jerk.

03:10.618 --> 03:12.652
Oh, fanny pack?

03:12.720 --> 03:14.621
Finally-- yes,
at Area 51.

03:14.689 --> 03:16.239
When I met Stan,
I was wearing

03:16.307 --> 03:17.674
my special fanny pack.

03:17.742 --> 03:19.743
But it fell off
and I had to choose

03:19.811 --> 03:21.795
between grabbing it
or saving Stan.

03:21.863 --> 03:23.830
Clearly, I chose wrong.

03:23.898 --> 03:26.433
Oh.

03:26.501 --> 03:28.335
Aren't you going to ask
me what's so special

03:28.402 --> 03:29.936
about the fanny pack?
Okay.

03:30.004 --> 03:31.354
What's so
special about...?

03:31.422 --> 03:32.973
That's personal!
Stay out of my business!

03:38.930 --> 03:41.147
Oh, oh, no!

03:41.215 --> 03:43.316
Tell Francine to stay
out of my business!

03:48.105 --> 03:49.906
And lunch today will be pizza

03:49.974 --> 03:51.191
and tater tots.

03:51.259 --> 03:53.693
Tater tots!
All right!

03:53.761 --> 03:55.929
Hey-a, friendos!
How's this sound?

03:55.997 --> 03:58.832
"The Sci-Fi Club will meet
Wednesday at 3:00.

03:58.900 --> 04:01.334
"This week's topic:
the complicated relationship

04:01.402 --> 04:03.336
between black people
and science fiction."

04:03.404 --> 04:05.505
Sounds good.
Hey, here he comes.

04:05.573 --> 04:07.641
Hey, Zack,
could you announce

04:07.708 --> 04:09.276
our Sci-Fi Club
meeting tomorrow?

04:09.343 --> 04:10.944
Yeah... no.

04:11.012 --> 04:12.579
But it's a club and...

04:12.647 --> 04:14.598
Look, I decide
what's worth announcing

04:14.665 --> 04:16.466
and stupid crap
like that ain't it.

04:18.569 --> 04:20.353
Wow, what a jerk.

04:20.421 --> 04:22.639
Someone should put Zack
in his place.

04:22.707 --> 04:24.941
Yeah, his ego is
out of control.

04:25.009 --> 04:27.444
Like my blood sugar.

04:30.231 --> 04:32.449
Thanks for letting me
move in right away, Miles.

04:32.516 --> 04:34.134
Hey, no problem at all.

04:34.201 --> 04:35.835
Whoa, who is this dog?!

04:35.903 --> 04:38.104
Is this so we don't get boners
in the common area?

04:38.172 --> 04:39.272
That's my mother.

04:39.340 --> 04:40.440
Ugh! I wouldn't even

04:40.508 --> 04:42.142
do coke off this picture.

04:42.209 --> 04:43.476
Oh, who am I kidding?

04:43.544 --> 04:45.045
I would and I'm about to.

04:46.264 --> 04:47.747
Mama's boy!

04:49.366 --> 04:50.550
Your neighbor's
a mama's boy.

04:50.618 --> 04:51.818
Yeah, I know.

04:51.886 --> 04:53.453
Who's at the door, Todd?

04:53.521 --> 04:55.722
It's for me, Mommy!
I love you!

05:03.164 --> 05:04.531
What are you
doing up here?

05:04.599 --> 05:07.067
Oh, uh, just, uh,
enjoying Roger being gone.

05:07.134 --> 05:08.335
Oh, that's cool.

05:08.402 --> 05:10.203
So, I guess neither of us

05:10.271 --> 05:12.505
came up here
for any particular reason.

05:14.809 --> 05:18.178
And soccer practice had been
moved to the upper field.

05:18.245 --> 05:20.347
Are you sure
this'll work, Steve?

05:20.414 --> 05:23.049
Snot, this strategy
always works.

05:23.117 --> 05:25.318
And congratulations
to the badminton squad,

05:25.386 --> 05:27.420
who will be going to regionals.

05:27.488 --> 05:29.656
Zack, will you
announce our Sci-Fi Club meeting?

05:29.724 --> 05:31.157
I told you, no!

05:31.225 --> 05:33.593
But don't the students have
a right to hear about...?

05:33.661 --> 05:36.963
Those stupid sheep hear
what I <i>want</i> them to hear!

05:37.031 --> 05:38.431
I decide what
gets announced

05:38.499 --> 05:40.767
and those idiots out there
do what <i>I</i> tell them!

05:40.835 --> 05:42.569
Zachary,
for Pete's sake,

05:42.637 --> 05:43.770
the microphone
is still on!

05:48.976 --> 05:50.410
It worked!

05:50.478 --> 05:53.813
People always forget
the microphone is still on.

05:53.881 --> 05:56.783
I always forget the stove is on.

05:56.851 --> 05:59.986
Zachary, you've lost
your announcing privileges.

06:01.989 --> 06:04.407
Steve, I want you to be
our new announcer.

06:04.475 --> 06:07.143
Me? Uh, thank you, sir.

06:07.211 --> 06:08.845
Here's your trophy.

06:10.464 --> 06:11.681
I'm just kidding.

06:11.749 --> 06:12.949
Can you imagine
if you got this

06:13.000 --> 06:14.868
big-ass trophy
just for announcing?

06:14.935 --> 06:18.204
No. No, a trophy like this
is for when you star

06:18.272 --> 06:21.441
in over 40 adult films
in under two months.

06:21.509 --> 06:23.977
That's how you get
a trophy like this, son.

06:27.348 --> 06:30.383
Sorry, things didn't work out
with your new roommate, Roger.

06:30.451 --> 06:33.486
I tell you, it's a cruel,
cruel world out here.

06:33.554 --> 06:35.488
Did you know I saw
a man beat down

06:35.556 --> 06:37.257
another man today
for a sandwich?

06:37.324 --> 06:38.792
A sandwich, Francine!

06:38.859 --> 06:40.927
This sandwich.

06:40.995 --> 06:42.495
I wish I could just come home.

06:42.563 --> 06:44.764
So come home.
We want you there.

06:44.832 --> 06:47.100
Stan doesn't.
As far as he's concerned,

06:47.168 --> 06:48.501
the only reason
I was living there

06:48.569 --> 06:50.070
was the life debt he owed me.

06:50.137 --> 06:51.321
And now, it's repaid.

06:51.389 --> 06:53.289
Forget about the life debt.

06:53.357 --> 06:55.675
Stan's too proud
to admit he misses you,

06:55.743 --> 06:57.477
but I know he does.

06:57.545 --> 07:00.480
Hey! What if you
offered to pay rent?

07:00.548 --> 07:03.316
Then Stan would have a perfect
excuse to take you back.

07:03.384 --> 07:05.518
You know, that could
actually work.

07:05.586 --> 07:07.137
I don't mind
paying a little rent.

07:07.204 --> 07:08.972
All right, I'm coming home!

07:10.541 --> 07:12.108
Hi, kids!

07:14.695 --> 07:17.313
As soon as Stan
sees my face,

07:17.364 --> 07:19.082
he'll realize how much
he's missed me.

07:21.585 --> 07:23.420
This isn't my feather boa.

07:23.487 --> 07:25.121
It's beautiful,
but it's not mine.

07:26.390 --> 07:28.041

What is going on?

07:41.055 --> 07:42.806
Stan, who the hell is this?

Andy, if you need anything,
just let me know.

08:11.189 --> 08:12.439
Welcome to our home.

08:14.008 --> 08:17.010
How could Stan think
he could replace me with you?

08:17.078 --> 08:19.263
You are so annoying.

08:19.330 --> 08:20.998
I'm not annoying.

Stan, you're renting the attic

like Roger.

09:30.702 --> 09:32.269
Just admit you miss him.

09:32.337 --> 09:34.021
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

09:34.088 --> 09:35.355
Andy is nothing like Roger.

Well done, Steve!

09:50.154 --> 09:52.289
That's right, Snot,
'cause I'm the man!

09:52.357 --> 09:54.358
Whatever I say goes.

09:57.762 --> 09:59.496
I said Miss de Gaulle's
French class

09:59.564 --> 10:02.182
was moved to room 215,
and it is.

10:02.250 --> 10:05.369
I see you, baby,
shakin' that derriere.

10:05.436 --> 10:06.903
That means butthole.

10:08.573 --> 10:11.658
And, behold, I said
lunch was lasagna,

10:11.726 --> 10:13.143
and they're eating
lasagna!

10:13.211 --> 10:15.112
Everything
I say happens!

10:16.914 --> 10:18.048
We've got
to do something.

10:18.116 --> 10:19.850
Steve is drunk
with power.

10:19.917 --> 10:22.219
The drunker he gets,
the better I look.

10:30.645 --> 10:33.080
Roger?

10:33.147 --> 10:35.432
Sorry.

10:35.516 --> 10:37.067
I-I'm looking for a friend.

10:37.135 --> 10:40.087
I'd say you found one.

10:40.154 --> 10:42.022
Boing!

10:43.841 --> 10:45.809
Roger?

10:45.893 --> 10:47.260
Oh, hey, Franny.

10:47.328 --> 10:48.795
I was just catching some "Zs."

10:48.863 --> 10:51.231
I got your message
that you were staying here.

10:51.299 --> 10:55.368
Roger, this YMCA stopped renting
out rooms, like, 30 years ago.

10:55.436 --> 10:58.121
What?! I just put up
all my pictures.

10:58.189 --> 11:01.108
Oh, I wish you and Stan
could just patch things up.

11:01.175 --> 11:02.292
It's too late.

11:02.360 --> 11:03.977
I've been replaced.

11:07.949 --> 11:09.616
Good for you.

11:09.684 --> 11:11.518
You can't give up, Roger.

11:11.586 --> 11:13.587
Maybe you just need
to remind Stan

11:13.654 --> 11:15.188
why you guys were once friends.

11:15.256 --> 11:17.257
That's a great idea, Franny.

11:17.325 --> 11:19.726
Tell you what.
Bring Stan to the zoo tomorrow.

11:19.794 --> 11:21.561
That's where I've been pooing--
in the peacock hutch.

11:21.629 --> 11:24.264
After he spends the day
with me away from Andy,

11:24.332 --> 11:26.349
he'll remember
how good we are together

11:26.417 --> 11:28.034
and he'll invite me
to move back in!

11:28.102 --> 11:30.470
I'll go talk to Stan right now.
I'll walk you out.

11:30.538 --> 11:31.988
Let me run upstairs
and change.

11:42.116 --> 11:44.117
Uh-oh, storm's a-comin'.

11:53.511 --> 11:56.112
STEVE Finally, the
janitorial staff has a friendly reminder.

11:56.180 --> 11:58.715
Please do not defecate
in the urinals.

12:00.685 --> 12:02.953
Don't forget to
announce debate team practice.

12:03.020 --> 12:04.304
Screw debate. Go away!

12:04.372 --> 12:06.540
It's an official school team.

12:06.607 --> 12:09.042
It's only a school team
if <i>I</i> say it's a school team!

12:09.110 --> 12:10.510
<i>I</i> do the announcements,

12:10.578 --> 12:13.663
and all those mongoloids
and tampon-eaters do what I say!

12:13.731 --> 12:15.532
Steven!
For Pete's sake, boy,

12:15.600 --> 12:16.900
the microphone is still on!

12:21.973 --> 12:25.075
Snot, from now on, you're
doing the announcements.

12:25.142 --> 12:26.376
Yes, sir.

12:26.444 --> 12:29.312
Brought down
by an open microphone.

12:29.380 --> 12:30.780
We had to do it, Steve.

12:30.848 --> 12:32.382
You were out of control.

12:32.450 --> 12:34.584
Like my cholesterol.

12:34.652 --> 12:37.521
Jeez, Barry, you have
a lot of health problems.

12:41.993 --> 12:44.094
Enjoy that, fancy birds.

12:46.380 --> 12:48.815
Stan, you're here!
Roger.

12:48.883 --> 12:50.650
Damn it, Andy.
Can I put you down now?

12:50.718 --> 12:52.986
But I feel so snug, Stan.

12:53.054 --> 12:55.755
Ooh, this must be
how baby kangaroos feel

12:55.823 --> 12:57.858
when they're on heroin.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.861
What is he doing here?

13:00.928 --> 13:03.430
Oh, Stan insisted
on bringing him.

13:03.497 --> 13:06.016
Mostly, because every time
we leave him alone in the house,

13:06.083 --> 13:07.751
he has sex with the groceries.

13:07.818 --> 13:11.237
Ugh, that guy is such
an annoying, selfish jerk.

13:11.289 --> 13:13.323
This is a disaster.

13:13.391 --> 13:15.775
Why did Stan
have to save my life?

13:15.843 --> 13:18.428
I just wish things could go
back to the way they were

13:18.512 --> 13:20.180
when he still owed
me that life debt.

13:20.248 --> 13:21.798
That's it!

13:28.706 --> 13:30.073
What the hell
are you doing?!

13:30.141 --> 13:32.042
Acting like a genius.

13:32.109 --> 13:34.444
All I have to do is grab
that ladder over there,

13:34.512 --> 13:36.179
lower it down, and save Stan.

13:36.247 --> 13:38.682
He'll owe me a new life debt
and I can move back in.

13:43.988 --> 13:45.455
Don't worry, Stan.

13:45.523 --> 13:47.106
I'll save you!

13:48.409 --> 13:50.577
No, I'm supposed to save him!

13:56.634 --> 13:59.302
No!

14:00.922 --> 14:02.756
It's my life debt!

14:02.807 --> 14:04.307
You're crazy!
You're so crazy! Aah!

14:09.513 --> 14:11.798
Aah!

14:19.857 --> 14:21.908
It's all right!
I'm okay!

14:21.976 --> 14:24.444
Eww!

14:24.512 --> 14:27.247
St!

14:27.314 --> 14:28.665
Don't worry, Stan.

14:28.733 --> 14:30.583
I'm going to take you
to the hospital.

14:30.651 --> 14:32.552
No, I need to save him!

14:39.226 --> 14:40.476
Damn it, Roger!

14:40.543 --> 14:42.011
Take him to a hospital!

14:42.062 --> 14:43.562
Franny, we've
been over this.

14:43.647 --> 14:45.380
I can't take Stan
to a hospital

14:45.432 --> 14:47.483
because then a doctor
would save him.

14:47.550 --> 14:50.019
To restore the life debt,
<i>I</i> have to save him.

14:50.070 --> 14:51.187
This is crazy!

14:51.238 --> 14:52.655
Well, I think you're crazy.

14:52.722 --> 14:53.939
See? Isn't that hurtful?

14:54.024 --> 14:55.274
You son of a bitch!

14:55.358 --> 14:57.243
I'm going to rip
your throat out!

14:57.327 --> 14:59.445
Oh, okay. It always ends
with you being a potty mouth,

14:59.529 --> 15:00.579
so I'm hanging up.

15:02.699 --> 15:04.750
Roger?

15:04.834 --> 15:07.086
I had a crazy dream.

15:07.170 --> 15:08.587
I was at the zoo and...

15:10.240 --> 15:11.790
Oh, my God!

15:11.875 --> 15:13.759
Don't worry.
I'm saving your life.

15:13.843 --> 15:15.410
I've got a special salve

15:15.462 --> 15:16.912
that'll make
your legs grow back.

15:16.963 --> 15:19.431
We just have to get
to my fanny pack in Area 51.

15:19.516 --> 15:20.766
Area 51?!

15:20.850 --> 15:23.385
Roger, take me to a hospital!
I'm bleeding to death!

15:23.436 --> 15:25.854
Which is exactly why we
don't have time to argue.

15:25.922 --> 15:27.640
We have to get
you to Area 51

15:27.724 --> 15:28.891
and there's not
a moment to spare.

15:28.942 --> 15:30.526
♪

15:37.017 --> 15:38.817

15:48.128 --> 15:49.495

15:51.431 --> 15:53.065
to get us past
the front gate and...

15:53.133 --> 15:54.667
Stan?

15:56.686 --> 15:58.520
Looks like it's up to me.

16:07.497 --> 16:09.331
Identification, sir.

16:11.635 --> 16:13.152
Thank you, sir.

16:16.539 --> 16:17.539
Good-bye, sir.

16:21.477 --> 16:22.811
That's a very
nice bird, sir.

16:26.116 --> 16:27.850
Sir, you're cleared
to enter the base.

16:27.917 --> 16:29.718
You don't have to keep
showing me things you can do.

16:48.388 --> 16:50.939
Steve, look, about yesterday...

16:51.007 --> 16:52.958
No, you did the right thing.

16:53.026 --> 16:56.145
Just be careful doing
the announcements, okay?

16:56.212 --> 17:00.249
The power of the microphone--
it-it... it changes you.

17:00.317 --> 17:01.684
Don't worry, buddy.

17:01.751 --> 17:04.920
No stupid announcements
are going to change me.

17:04.988 --> 17:06.821
I do the announcements!

17:06.890 --> 17:08.656
I am the second coming!

17:08.724 --> 17:10.858
I speak for God now!

17:13.762 --> 17:15.314
Schmuley!

17:19.886 --> 17:22.354
Barry, you're doing
the announcements now.

17:27.127 --> 17:29.294
Ah.

17:29.362 --> 17:32.981
You ,
you're gonna do what I say

17:33.049 --> 17:36.551
or I will put my foot
so far up your ,

17:36.603 --> 17:39.655
you will rue the day you crawled
out of your mother's !

17:39.723 --> 17:40.689
Barry!

17:43.059 --> 17:44.526
I made a swear.

17:44.594 --> 17:46.161
All right, that's it.

17:46.229 --> 17:48.163
We're not doing
daily announcements anymore.

17:48.231 --> 17:50.699
All of you just get out of here.

17:53.286 --> 17:54.920
Damn kids.

17:56.606 --> 18:00.192
Sometimes I think I should have
just stayed in Peru moving coke.

18:00.260 --> 18:03.662
Machado was a cold bastard,
but he was good to his men.

18:03.730 --> 18:06.665
And once you drew blood for him,
you were set.

18:06.733 --> 18:09.234
Hooch, blow, girls--

18:09.302 --> 18:11.070
not women, girls.

18:11.137 --> 18:13.588
Little bitty things.

18:13.640 --> 18:15.340
Brian!

18:17.043 --> 18:19.778
Oh, me!

18:21.281 --> 18:22.531
Roger?

18:22.598 --> 18:24.733
It's okay, Stan.
We're inside Area 51,

18:24.784 --> 18:27.403
and I think I know exactly
where to find my fanny pack.

18:27.454 --> 18:29.288
Just take me
to a hospital.

18:29.372 --> 18:30.839
Ugh, you are a broken record.

18:34.427 --> 18:36.261
That must be where
my fanny pack is.

18:39.799 --> 18:40.849
I knew it.

18:40.917 --> 18:42.418
Hello, beautiful.

18:48.491 --> 18:49.975
Stay with me, Stan.

18:51.127 --> 18:52.394
Roger?

18:52.462 --> 18:54.680
I feel... better.

18:54.764 --> 18:55.814
A lot better.

18:55.899 --> 18:57.065
I feel like... Oh!

18:57.133 --> 18:58.684
Don't worry. They'll
grow to full size,

18:58.768 --> 19:00.953
but it takes a few hours,
so you're going to have

19:01.020 --> 19:03.155
to do the baby leg thing
for a little while.

19:03.223 --> 19:06.492
Roger, you... saved my life.

19:06.559 --> 19:08.660
And you owe me
a life debt again.

19:08.728 --> 19:10.863
Guess you'll have
to kick Andy Dick out

19:10.947 --> 19:12.314
and let me move back in.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.167
Scientists!

19:15.235 --> 19:16.919
Hey, guys, I'm glad you're here.

19:16.986 --> 19:19.004
We got separated
from our tour group.

19:19.072 --> 19:21.273
I'm safari man Hubert LeGrange

19:21.341 --> 19:23.308
and this is my sidekick
Wheelbarrow Tim,

19:23.376 --> 19:24.977
AKA Babylegs O'Hurlihan.

19:25.044 --> 19:26.612
No, you're an alien,

19:26.679 --> 19:27.796
and that's
your picture.

19:27.864 --> 19:29.982
Damn it! Run, Stan!

19:30.049 --> 19:31.550
Get 'em!

19:34.020 --> 19:35.387
They're gaining
on us!

19:35.472 --> 19:36.522
Damn baby legs.

19:41.644 --> 19:42.561
Can't turn.

19:42.645 --> 19:43.929
Have to jump it.

19:54.824 --> 19:55.657
Yes.

19:56.910 --> 19:58.911
I think we lost 'em.

19:59.946 --> 20:01.697
Roger!

20:06.536 --> 20:09.221
Aw, crap, you saved my life.

20:09.305 --> 20:10.556
Isn't that good?

20:10.640 --> 20:13.475
No. That means we're even
on life debts again.

20:13.543 --> 20:15.260
I wanted you
to owe me, so...

20:15.345 --> 20:17.379
Never mind.

20:17.430 --> 20:19.348
I'll look for another room
to rent.

20:19.399 --> 20:21.433
No, Roger, don't.

20:21.518 --> 20:24.386
Look, I didn't even remember
the life debt

20:24.437 --> 20:25.971
until Hayley brought it up.

20:26.039 --> 20:30.993
I just didn't want to admit that
I... like having you around.

20:31.060 --> 20:32.828
What about Andy Dick?

20:32.896 --> 20:34.897
You were doing a lot
of cool stuff with him.

20:34.964 --> 20:36.532
I saw you hold his nose

20:36.583 --> 20:38.984
until he spit out that Band-Aid
he found on the sidewalk.

20:39.052 --> 20:41.053
Andy Dick bugs
the crap out of me.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.638
You bug the crap
out of me too,

20:42.705 --> 20:44.540
but, well...

20:44.591 --> 20:46.275
with you it's different.

20:46.342 --> 20:48.277
And I want you
to move back in.

20:48.344 --> 20:50.996
Oh, Staniel,
you love me!

20:51.064 --> 20:53.599
Oh, man, I can't wait
to move back home.

20:53.666 --> 20:56.635
We just have to figure out
how to get rid of Andy Dick.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.137
Go get the pills, boy.

21:01.791 --> 21:03.141
Punch it!

21:03.226 --> 21:05.611
Smart throwing him
those drugs.

21:05.695 --> 21:07.062
Actually they
were Tic Tacs.

21:07.113 --> 21:09.114
Smarter.

21:14.992 --> 21:18.244
Um, Stan, Andy Dick's
running after us.

21:18.312 --> 21:19.446
What? I'm going 55.

21:19.497 --> 21:21.031
He's catching up to us.

21:22.316 --> 21:24.084
Faster, Stan.
He's gonna get us.

21:24.151 --> 21:26.152
Why didn't you
give him real drugs?

21:26.203 --> 21:27.587
You fool!
You've killed us both!

21:27.655 --> 21:29.789
Oh, no, he's...

21:29.857 --> 21:31.124
passing us?

21:34.545 --> 21:36.463
Oh, yeah, he's robbing
a pharmacy.

21:36.514 --> 21:38.331
We're okay.

21:38.382 --> 21:40.216
We're gonna be okay.

21:40.301 --> 21:42.118
Bye! Have a beautiful time.
