00:16.363 --> 00:17.887
oh, Kenny,

00:17.931 --> 00:19.990
-it's 1 :45-- you got to go.
-What?

00:20.033 --> 00:21.660
Get up, get up.

00:21.702 --> 00:22.794
-oh.
-We fell asleep--

00:22.836 --> 00:24.269
you got to go home.

00:24.371 --> 00:25.668
oh, my God.

00:25.706 --> 00:27.674
oh, my God,
l hate this.

00:27.708 --> 00:29.403
Not as much as l do.

00:29.443 --> 00:31.206
What are you
gonna tell Diane?

00:31.244 --> 00:32.404
l have no idea.

00:32.445 --> 00:34.038
Maybe she'll finally
get mad enough

00:34.081 --> 00:35.878
to kick me out of the house.

00:35.916 --> 00:37.178
l wish.

00:37.217 --> 00:38.809
lt's not like you're gonna walk
out on your own.

00:38.852 --> 00:40.183
come on, Val,
we've talked about this.

00:40.220 --> 00:41.278
You know it's not that simple.

00:41.355 --> 00:42.447
Yes, it is.

00:42.489 --> 00:43.979
You know, l'm
21 years old,

00:44.024 --> 00:46.288
l'm single, l can sleep
with whoever l want to.

00:46.360 --> 00:49.261
So why am l the one who...
who feels guilty all the time?

00:49.296 --> 00:50.695
l feel guilty, too.

00:50.731 --> 00:51.698
Does that make
you feel any better?

00:51.732 --> 00:53.097
No.

00:53.133 --> 00:54.964
l just think you want
to have it all, and you can't.

00:55.001 --> 00:57.128
Valerie, this is not about me.

00:57.170 --> 00:58.398
-oh, really?
-My son

00:58.438 --> 01:00.065
is six years old.

01:00.107 --> 01:02.598
He has kid feelings, okay?
We have grown-up feelings.

01:02.642 --> 01:04.108
Why should he have to suffer

01:04.144 --> 01:06.237
because l'm not in love
with his mother anymore.

01:06.346 --> 01:09.509
l can't do this anymore.

01:09.549 --> 01:10.743
l thought l could.

01:10.784 --> 01:13.082
l-l thought
l could be sophisticated.

01:13.120 --> 01:14.951
But l guess l'm not.

01:14.988 --> 01:17.013
Whoa, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

01:17.057 --> 01:18.524
What are you saying?

01:18.558 --> 01:20.048
Are you ending this?

01:20.093 --> 01:22.254
lt's not like
l want to, Kenny.

01:22.295 --> 01:24.456
But l'm tired of
sneaking around.

01:24.498 --> 01:27.797
You either tell Diane
the truth, or it's over.

03:17.477 --> 03:19.741
-You look awful.
-Thanks.

03:19.779 --> 03:20.871
Who's the lucky guy?

03:20.914 --> 03:22.541
Does it always
have to be a guy?

03:22.582 --> 03:23.708
Let's see,
you come in

03:23.750 --> 03:25.240
at 7:00 in the morning
looking like

03:25.352 --> 03:27.513
you've been up all night--
looks like a guy to me.

03:27.554 --> 03:30.489
lt's Kenny, Brandon.

03:30.524 --> 03:32.492
Yeah, l figured that.

03:32.526 --> 03:35.017
-Did he leave his wife?
-Not yet, but he's going to.

03:35.061 --> 03:36.722
And how long has he
been telling you that?

03:36.763 --> 03:37.991
These things take time.

03:38.031 --> 03:39.726
Haven't you ever watched
a soap opera, Val?

03:39.766 --> 03:41.028
He's not gonna leave his wife.

03:41.067 --> 03:42.534
And what makes you
the big expert?

03:42.569 --> 03:45.732
l have experience
in this arena, all right?

03:45.772 --> 03:47.797
You with a married woman? Who?

03:47.841 --> 03:49.069
She was trouble.

03:49.109 --> 03:50.269
Just like Kenny.

03:50.377 --> 03:52.675
Do yourself a favor,
go to David's party,

03:52.712 --> 03:54.839
meet some nice young guy who,
preferably, isn't married.

03:54.881 --> 03:56.280
Well, thank you, Dr. Walsh.

03:56.316 --> 03:58.716
l'll take two aspirin
and l'll call you if l need you.

04:14.634 --> 04:17.432
Are you guys wearing
bathing suits to David's party?

04:17.470 --> 04:19.836
oh, God, no way--
l'm not gonna parade around

04:19.873 --> 04:22.137
so David and his friends
can gawk at me all day.

04:22.175 --> 04:23.437
Me, either.

04:23.476 --> 04:26.411
But l guarantee
those neighbors of theirs

04:26.446 --> 04:28.744
-will show up half naked.
-Yeah, what's up

04:28.782 --> 04:30.010
with those girls, anyway?

04:30.050 --> 04:31.881
Have you seen how they
flirt with David and Mark?

04:31.918 --> 04:33.010
No, they don't.

04:33.053 --> 04:34.520
You're just jealous.

04:34.554 --> 04:36.545
oh, yeah. Jealous of what?

04:36.590 --> 04:38.114
oh, you're not still into David?

04:38.158 --> 04:40.353
What, l'm-l'm going
to the party, aren't l?

04:40.393 --> 04:42.691
David and l are friends.

04:42.729 --> 04:43.718
Right, and if he wants

04:43.763 --> 04:45.856
to drool all over
his neighbors, then...

04:45.899 --> 04:47.196
That'd be his business.

04:47.233 --> 04:48.359
Please, clare,

04:48.401 --> 04:50.028
like you haven't noticed,
every time Steve

04:50.070 --> 04:53.096
is up at that house, his eyes
practically pop out of his head.

04:53.139 --> 04:53.935
No, they don't.

04:54.741 --> 04:55.571
Do they?

04:56.576 --> 04:59.409
Well, Steve and l
have this arrangement.

04:59.446 --> 05:02.210
Looking's fine;
touching ain't.

05:02.315 --> 05:03.942
-All right.
-So, um,

05:03.984 --> 05:05.884
what time are we heading
up to the party?

05:05.919 --> 05:07.409
You guys go without me--
l told David

05:07.454 --> 05:09.547
l would stop at my mom's
and pick up some bowls.

05:09.589 --> 05:11.113
They're serving food?

05:11.157 --> 05:12.886
Apparently, they're
going all out.

05:12.926 --> 05:15.224
David said they're serving
pretzels and potato chips.

05:15.295 --> 05:18.321
Wow. This is
gonna be some party.

05:20.467 --> 05:22.833
Yeah.

05:32.512 --> 05:34.810
l heard it's supposed to be,

05:34.848 --> 05:36.577
like, 103 today.

05:36.616 --> 05:38.516
No way-- not
in the hills.

05:38.551 --> 05:40.985
All right, well, 97,
then, if we're lucky.

05:41.021 --> 05:43.251
Wait. Look at that.

05:43.289 --> 05:44.449
What?

05:46.126 --> 05:47.923
over there.

05:47.961 --> 05:49.929
lt's a deer.

05:49.963 --> 05:51.590
oh, my gosh!

05:51.631 --> 05:53.599
You know, it's getting
rarer and rarer

05:53.633 --> 05:55.260
to see deer
up in these hills.

05:55.368 --> 05:58.269
My dad, he always says if you
spot one it's really good luck.

05:58.338 --> 06:00.533
Well, we must have double
good luck, 'cause there's

06:00.573 --> 06:02.336
-another one.
-oh!

06:02.375 --> 06:06.106
You know, l've never seen
a baby deer so close before.

06:06.146 --> 06:08.205
They must come down here
looking for water in this heat.

06:08.248 --> 06:11.479
Mm. Maybe they'll come to
David's with us and have a brew.

06:12.986 --> 06:14.613
oh, they're
so beautiful, aren't they?

06:14.654 --> 06:18.647
lt's amazing they
can even survive up here.

06:18.692 --> 06:21.525
Well, it's like everyone else
trying to make it in this town--

06:21.561 --> 06:23.461
they start out innocent,
but sooner or later

06:23.496 --> 06:25.123
they'll claw
their way to the top.

06:25.165 --> 06:27.725
clare, they're animals.

06:27.767 --> 06:29.792
Who isn't?

06:32.172 --> 06:33.867
-oh...
-oh...

06:33.907 --> 06:35.875
-how cute.
-look.

06:35.909 --> 06:39.675
one more time! Here we go!

06:39.713 --> 06:41.374
one...

06:41.414 --> 06:42.881
two...

06:42.916 --> 06:44.543
three!

06:44.584 --> 06:46.211
Hey! Watch it!

06:46.252 --> 06:48.220
Hey, you watch it,
or you're next!

06:49.756 --> 06:50.882
-Hey.
-Hi.

06:50.924 --> 06:52.516
l was afraid you
wouldn't show up.

06:52.559 --> 06:54.493
oh, and miss
this elegant gathering? Mm-mm.

06:54.527 --> 06:56.495
Ah, good-- Mark's been
asking about you all week.

06:56.529 --> 06:57.962
-oh, he has?
-Yep.

06:57.997 --> 06:59.157
What has he been saying?

06:59.199 --> 07:00.530
oh, same thing he said last week

07:00.567 --> 07:02.865
and the week before that
and the week before that.

07:02.902 --> 07:04.494
He says he keeps
asking you out,

07:04.537 --> 07:06.835
and you keep telling him
it's not the right time.

07:06.873 --> 07:10.400
Well, you know what they say:
timing is everything.

07:10.443 --> 07:12.536
Speaking of timing,

07:12.579 --> 07:14.444
l just came up

07:14.481 --> 07:16.176
with the perfect
margarita blend.

07:16.216 --> 07:19.049
oh! David, l am
so proud of you.

07:19.085 --> 07:21.713
Now you're gonna have
something to fall back on.

07:25.291 --> 07:26.519
Hey, guys!

07:26.559 --> 07:27.651
-Hi, Mark.
-Hey, Mark.

07:27.694 --> 07:28.854
out of ice already?

07:28.895 --> 07:30.157
Nah, l'm just
thinking ahead.

07:30.196 --> 07:31.663
They're drinking
like fish out there.

07:31.698 --> 07:33.165
At 1 1 :00
in the morning?

07:33.199 --> 07:34.496
That is quite
a party.

07:34.534 --> 07:36.058
lt's got promise.

07:36.102 --> 07:38.400
lt's got promise.

07:40.406 --> 07:42.533
come on, let's
go get a drink.

07:42.575 --> 07:43.872
You sure about that?

07:43.910 --> 07:45.104
Lemonade, Brandon--
l wouldn't want

07:45.145 --> 07:47.079
your friends to think
l was a lush.

07:47.113 --> 07:49.604
Lemonade, the cool,
refreshing drink...

07:55.789 --> 07:57.757
on the other hand, even
if l got plastered,

07:57.791 --> 07:59.088
l don't think anyone
would notice.

07:59.125 --> 08:00.956
l don't think they
would, either, baby.

08:00.994 --> 08:01.983
cocktails right this way.

08:02.028 --> 08:03.757
A fried bacon
and tomato sandwich?

08:04.864 --> 08:05.990
Hey, Silver.

08:06.032 --> 08:07.499
Hey, what's up, Steve, boy?

08:07.534 --> 08:09.968
What's up?
Hey, give me a sip of that.

08:12.005 --> 08:14.997
Mmm! You make a hell
of a margarita, Dave.

08:15.041 --> 08:16.201
Thanks.

08:16.276 --> 08:19.211
Tell me, my friend,
who are those girls?

08:19.279 --> 08:22.180
ooh...

08:22.215 --> 08:23.910
those are my new neighbors,

08:23.950 --> 08:25.315
Nina and Teresa.

08:25.351 --> 08:27.819
couple of hotties--
aren't you lucky.

08:29.022 --> 08:30.922
So, uh, why don't
you introduce me.

08:30.957 --> 08:32.583
l'll be your slave for life.

08:32.625 --> 08:33.751
Steve, what about clare?

08:33.793 --> 08:37.092
She'll be your slave, too.

08:37.130 --> 08:39.222
Who are all these people?

08:39.299 --> 08:40.596
l don't know.

08:40.633 --> 08:44.330
They sure look like
they're having a good time.

08:46.739 --> 08:50.641
That guy is totally
smiling at me.

08:50.677 --> 08:52.645
So smile back.

08:52.679 --> 08:54.647
Uh, l have a
boyfriend, remember?

08:54.681 --> 08:57.616
So, tell him
to smile at me.

09:00.386 --> 09:02.081
Maybe he is
smiling at you.

09:02.121 --> 09:04.021
Look at him, right there.

09:05.658 --> 09:07.489
Dick Harrison?
You know him.

09:07.527 --> 09:09.154
-No, l don't.
-You don't?

09:09.195 --> 09:11.356
l thought all you brainy
types hang out together.

09:11.397 --> 09:13.991
He's a genius--
Phi Beta Kappa, like you.

09:14.033 --> 09:17.002
Hm. l guess l'll have
to stop slumming.

09:17.036 --> 09:18.469
Ha-ha-ha!

09:18.504 --> 09:20.165
What, you think he's cute?

09:20.206 --> 09:21.798
Not bad for a genius.

09:21.841 --> 09:22.967
oh,

09:23.009 --> 09:24.670
he's coming.

09:24.711 --> 09:26.076
-Hi.
-Hey, Donna, how you doing?

09:26.112 --> 09:27.875
-Hey, Dick. How are you?
-Fine, fine, thanks.

09:27.914 --> 09:29.609
Actually, l was hoping you'd
introduce me

09:29.649 --> 09:30.775
to your friend here.

09:30.817 --> 09:32.045
l'm Dick Harrison.

09:32.085 --> 09:33.416
Hi. l'm clare Arnold.

09:33.453 --> 09:34.852
oh, the chancellor's
daughter?

09:34.888 --> 09:37.152
-Sorry.
-oh, no, don't be--

09:37.190 --> 09:39.317
l took your dad's economics
seminar-- he's a riot.

09:39.359 --> 09:42.089
Yeah, in a painfully
boring kind of way.

09:42.128 --> 09:44.653
Yeah, l guess you
could say that.

09:44.697 --> 09:46.631
Yeah, well, Dick and l

09:46.666 --> 09:48.998
were on lnterGreek council
together, so, uh...

09:49.035 --> 09:50.730
oh, really?
What house were you in?

09:50.770 --> 09:51.566
Beta Gamma Beta.

09:51.604 --> 09:54.232
Well, nobody's perfect.

09:56.442 --> 09:59.002
That's the, uh, last line
in my favorite film.

09:59.045 --> 10:00.672
Some Like lt Hot.

10:00.713 --> 10:03.876
Yeah. l-l'll bet you a drink you
can't remember who said it.

10:05.184 --> 10:07.118
Joe E. Brown.

10:07.153 --> 10:08.552
Funniest guy
in the '50s.

10:08.588 --> 10:09.953
That's right.

10:11.491 --> 10:13.391
Do you want to dance?

10:13.426 --> 10:15.087
Actually, l'm looking
for my boyfriend, so...

10:15.128 --> 10:16.356
Your boyfriend?

10:17.597 --> 10:18.791
Yeah.

10:18.831 --> 10:19.923
Sorry.

10:19.966 --> 10:22.059
Well, nobody's perfect.

10:30.476 --> 10:32.603
You must be
David's neighbor.

10:32.645 --> 10:33.771
Hi.

10:33.813 --> 10:34.973
Yeah, l'm Teresa;
l live next-door.

10:35.014 --> 10:36.538
l'm Steve. You know, l
was just gonna go over

10:36.582 --> 10:38.607
to the bar and get something to
drink-- you want something?

10:38.651 --> 10:39.709
Yeah, sure.

10:39.752 --> 10:41.515
can you do me
a favor first?

10:41.554 --> 10:42.578
Sure.

10:42.622 --> 10:44.283
l can't reach my back.

10:45.491 --> 10:46.822
Sure.

10:52.031 --> 10:53.658
How's that?

10:53.700 --> 10:55.133
Perfect.

11:02.275 --> 11:04.607
Some states, you need a license
for a massage like this.

11:04.644 --> 11:05.906
Yeah, well, actually,

11:05.945 --> 11:07.913
l have a license
on my bedroom wall at home.

11:09.015 --> 11:11.006
That's funny. You're funny.

11:11.050 --> 11:12.540
Excuse me. Are you
Steve Sanders?

11:12.585 --> 11:13.984
-Hey, clare.
-Hi.

11:14.020 --> 11:15.248
Hi. l'm Teresa.

11:15.321 --> 11:16.686
Hi.

11:16.723 --> 11:18.213
lt was nice to
meet you, Teresa.

11:18.257 --> 11:19.246
You, too, Steve.

11:19.325 --> 11:20.587
You really are funny,
you know that?

11:21.861 --> 11:23.453
Yeah, a regular conan o'Brien.

11:23.496 --> 11:25.896
come on.

11:25.932 --> 11:28.765
l don't know why, but l'm
giving you a second chance.

11:28.801 --> 11:30.564
Well, you should;
l deserve it.

11:30.603 --> 11:31.570
No, you don't.

11:31.604 --> 11:32.571
l do.

11:32.605 --> 11:34.596
Shut up and
kiss me anyway.

11:51.724 --> 11:52.691
Hello.

11:53.893 --> 11:55.520
Hi. Sounds like l woke you.

11:55.561 --> 11:57.426
You did.

11:57.463 --> 11:58.794
What time is it, anyway?

11:58.831 --> 12:01.561
lt's almost noon.

12:01.601 --> 12:03.364
l can't believe
l slept that long.

12:03.403 --> 12:04.563
Mmm.

12:04.604 --> 12:05.730
Listen, are you free today?

12:05.772 --> 12:07.501
No. l told you,
l have to go to that party.

12:07.540 --> 12:09.667
Will you do me a favor?

12:09.709 --> 12:10.733
Skip it.

12:10.777 --> 12:12.574
l really need to see you
this afternoon.

12:12.612 --> 12:13.738
Did you talk to her?

12:13.780 --> 12:15.509
can we meet at the apartment
around 1 :00-ish?

12:15.548 --> 12:17.982
okay.

12:18.017 --> 12:19.814
l love you.

12:19.852 --> 12:21.979
l love you, too.

12:22.021 --> 12:22.988
l'll see you soon.

12:23.022 --> 12:24.011
okay.

12:34.100 --> 12:35.761
Hey, margaritas anyone?

12:35.802 --> 12:37.133
Ah, hit me again, Waldo.

12:37.170 --> 12:38.228
open wide, baby.

12:38.271 --> 12:39.260
Ha...!

12:40.907 --> 12:42.101
What about you, darling?

12:42.141 --> 12:43.836
oh, l don't think so.

12:43.876 --> 12:46.504
lt's a little early in the day
for that taste in my mouth.

12:46.546 --> 12:48.275
oh, don't worry
about it.

12:48.347 --> 12:50.611
Got a nice bottle of bubbly
chilling on the ice for you.

12:50.650 --> 12:51.617
ooh, thanks.

12:51.651 --> 12:52.777
But l think l'll wait awhile.

12:52.819 --> 12:54.411
All right, just
let me know.

12:54.454 --> 12:56.285
Wow, this place is amazing.

12:56.355 --> 12:57.413
Quite the party house, huh?

12:57.457 --> 12:58.515
Yeah.

12:58.558 --> 13:00.287
Me and Mark really
get along well, too.

13:00.326 --> 13:01.315
oh, that's great.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.885
So, um, how's school?

13:03.930 --> 13:05.921
closed for the weekend.

13:12.105 --> 13:13.732
The iceman cometh.

13:13.773 --> 13:15.240
The iceman throw-eth
a good party.

13:15.274 --> 13:16.241
Well, thank you.

13:16.275 --> 13:17.469
lt runs in the blood.

13:17.510 --> 13:19.068
Besides, it's our farewell
to summer.

13:19.112 --> 13:20.579
lsn't that what
Labor Day is for?

13:20.613 --> 13:22.240
oh, l know. We had
a great party. Where were you?

13:22.348 --> 13:24.816
l wasn't invited, thank you.

13:24.851 --> 13:27.877
Well, from now on,
you're on that list, okay?

13:27.920 --> 13:28.944
Good.

13:28.988 --> 13:29.955
l'll hold you to it.

13:29.989 --> 13:31.149
l hope you do.

13:39.832 --> 13:41.129
Someone's in here.

13:41.167 --> 13:44.000
Sorry.

13:45.605 --> 13:46.731
What?!
What?! What?!

13:46.772 --> 13:49.263
Spider.
There's a spider in there.

13:49.308 --> 13:50.832
lt's so big.

13:50.877 --> 13:52.037
lt was coming
right at me.

13:52.078 --> 13:53.045
Don't worry about it.

13:54.080 --> 13:55.240
Thanks, all right.

13:55.281 --> 13:56.771
l take karate, but l still
can't handle spiders.

13:56.816 --> 13:58.147
Well, don't kill it.

13:58.184 --> 13:59.412
No, l'll just send it on

13:59.452 --> 14:01.113
a little ocean voyage,
that's all.

14:02.355 --> 14:04.220
You killed it.

14:04.257 --> 14:05.781
Well, it was
a black widow, Teresa.

14:05.825 --> 14:07.087
lt was a very old spider, too.

14:07.126 --> 14:08.354
l'm sure it led a full life.

14:08.394 --> 14:10.089
How could you tell its age?

14:10.129 --> 14:11.460
Well, l cut one of
the limbs off,

14:11.497 --> 14:12.486
counted the growth rings.
How else?

14:12.532 --> 14:13.965
oh.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.434
So you're funny and smart.

14:16.469 --> 14:18.130
Not to mention cute.

14:26.979 --> 14:28.105
You're despicable.

14:28.147 --> 14:30.012
clare.

14:30.049 --> 14:31.676
Don't even.

14:33.686 --> 14:35.517
No, you don't understand.

14:35.555 --> 14:37.318
Gee, sorry.

14:47.700 --> 14:50.100
okay, l think l got it.

14:50.136 --> 14:52.832
Donna went out with David
before he went out with clare,

14:52.872 --> 14:55.170
and then clare went
out with Steve,

14:55.208 --> 14:57.574
and then after clare, David
went out with Valerie,

14:57.610 --> 14:59.669
who lives in your house,
but she's not here.

14:59.712 --> 15:00.679
How am l doing?

15:00.713 --> 15:02.442
Perfect.

15:02.481 --> 15:04.847
So, the only one l haven't
met is your former ex,

15:04.884 --> 15:05.976
Kelly Taylor.

15:06.018 --> 15:07.144
or one of your
former exes.

15:08.187 --> 15:10.712
She's right over there.

15:10.756 --> 15:12.348
Thanks, man.

15:14.627 --> 15:16.060
-The one with Mark?
-She's not with Mark,

15:16.095 --> 15:17.062
she's just talking to Mark.

15:17.096 --> 15:18.996
conversing casually,
you know.

15:19.031 --> 15:19.998
Excuse me.

15:20.032 --> 15:21.226
You're excused.

15:21.334 --> 15:22.767
come on,
let's dance.

15:22.802 --> 15:23.826
oh, no, no, no, no.

15:23.869 --> 15:25.336
l only dance at night
and only the Macarena.

15:25.371 --> 15:26.633
Macarena and cheese,

15:26.672 --> 15:28.162
l like mine with
a little salsa mixed in.

15:28.207 --> 15:29.640
-Hey, Brandon.
-Hey, Muntz!

15:29.675 --> 15:30.699
How you doing, my man?

15:30.743 --> 15:31.835
Do you know Tracy Gaylian?

15:31.877 --> 15:33.071
Why, yes, l do.

15:33.112 --> 15:34.875
You look even better
in real life than on TV.

15:34.914 --> 15:36.643
-ooh, you are silky, my man.
-Ah, thank you.

15:36.682 --> 15:38.115
Silky! What's the haps?

15:38.150 --> 15:39.583
Well, l thought
l'd never get up here.

15:39.619 --> 15:40.586
There's freaking
fire trucks everywhere.

15:40.620 --> 15:41.587
Fire trucks?

15:41.621 --> 15:42.849
What's the deal?

15:42.888 --> 15:44.253
There's a fire
in the next canyon.

15:44.323 --> 15:47.053
At least there'll be
a cool light show, huh?

15:51.964 --> 15:53.522
Man, l think we got a problem.
Hey, Mark!

15:53.566 --> 15:54.794
Mark!

15:55.768 --> 15:57.759
l'll be right back.

16:00.439 --> 16:01.406
What? What's up?

16:01.440 --> 16:03.067
check it out.

16:06.345 --> 16:07.607
oh, no.

16:07.647 --> 16:10.207
Those hills haven't burned
in 40 years.

16:10.249 --> 16:11.511
ls that good or bad?

16:11.550 --> 16:12.812
That's very bad.

16:12.852 --> 16:15.082
40 years of underbrush,
that's a ton of kindling.

16:15.121 --> 16:16.782
l think a lot of drunk people

16:16.822 --> 16:18.949
are gonna get real sober,
real quick.

16:31.704 --> 16:34.229
l thought you'd
never get here.

16:34.340 --> 16:36.604
Hi, baby.

16:36.642 --> 16:38.576
There's a fire in the hills,
and Sunset's a mess.

16:38.611 --> 16:40.545
-Well, you're in a good mood.
-Yes, l am.

16:40.579 --> 16:41.807
And it's all
because of you.

16:41.847 --> 16:42.814
What happened?

16:42.848 --> 16:44.645
We finally talked about it.

16:44.684 --> 16:46.709
Diane and l finally talked
about our relationship.

16:46.752 --> 16:48.652
We were up
the whole night talking

16:48.688 --> 16:50.053
and really listening
to each other

16:50.089 --> 16:51.556
about how it's just
not working out.

16:51.590 --> 16:53.353
And you know what's funny?

16:53.392 --> 16:55.383
She's just as miserable as l am.

16:55.428 --> 16:56.986
She wants a change, too.

16:57.029 --> 16:58.621
l really think
this is gonna work out

16:58.664 --> 16:59.858
in the best possible way.

16:59.899 --> 17:02.197
Well, of course it could happen,
if you want it to.

17:02.301 --> 17:04.734
oh, you know it is.

17:06.571 --> 17:07.539
Mmm. You smell great.

17:07.573 --> 17:08.540
What is that?

17:08.574 --> 17:10.508
lt's Honey Dust.

17:10.542 --> 17:13.068
l sprinkle it on,
and you lick it off.

17:13.112 --> 17:15.204
ooh.

17:15.281 --> 17:16.270
Mmm.

17:18.184 --> 17:19.208
l love it.

17:19.251 --> 17:20.945
Where do you learn
all these things?

17:20.986 --> 17:22.613
Well, l'm self-taught.

17:24.223 --> 17:26.191
lt's amazing all the things
you know that my wife doesn't.

17:26.224 --> 17:28.215
You better believe it.

18:06.132 --> 18:07.360
So what'd they say?

18:07.400 --> 18:08.924
They're not evacuating
this canyon yet.

18:08.968 --> 18:10.196
Well, my car was one of

18:10.302 --> 18:11.530
the last ones let up the hill.

18:11.570 --> 18:13.197
They're only, uh,
letting residents up now.

18:13.305 --> 18:14.772
Listen, before you guys go,
can you help me get these people

18:14.807 --> 18:15.899
out of here?
l don't want a mob scene.

18:15.941 --> 18:17.101
Yeah, sure.

18:17.143 --> 18:18.167
-Yeah, no problem.
-Hey.

18:18.210 --> 18:20.075
l don't really want
to be in another fire.

18:20.112 --> 18:21.977
Kel, why don't you just
take whoever doesn't have

18:22.014 --> 18:23.174
a ride and get
out of here, huh?

18:23.215 --> 18:24.614
okay.

18:24.650 --> 18:25.981
ls she okay?

18:26.018 --> 18:27.315
Yeah, yeah.

18:27.353 --> 18:29.514
She's just got, she's
got a thing with fire.

18:29.555 --> 18:31.022
She got caught in
one and got burned.

18:31.056 --> 18:32.114
She gonna be all right?

18:32.158 --> 18:33.147
Yeah, yeah,
she'll be fine.

18:35.161 --> 18:37.095
All right, let's, uh, let's
get to it. Let's go out front.

18:39.031 --> 18:41.329
oh, God.

18:41.367 --> 18:42.334
l don't feel so good.

18:42.368 --> 18:43.335
l got to lay down.

18:43.369 --> 18:44.700
You okay?

18:46.739 --> 18:49.003
lt's not working;
l got to sit up.

18:49.041 --> 18:50.372
What's the matter?

18:53.579 --> 18:54.978
l just got to lay down.

18:55.014 --> 18:56.606
Maybe you need to throw up.

18:58.517 --> 19:01.611
That's it.

19:01.654 --> 19:04.487
Ew.

19:04.523 --> 19:05.751
All right, everybody, listen up.

19:05.791 --> 19:07.156
l've got some bad news, okay?

19:07.193 --> 19:09.684
Uh, we have to shut
the party down because

19:09.728 --> 19:11.787
there's a little fire
over in Nichols canyon,

19:11.831 --> 19:13.196
and the fire department
thinks it's best

19:13.232 --> 19:14.699
that everybody goes home, okay?

19:15.768 --> 19:16.962
l know, l know, l know, okay.

19:17.002 --> 19:19.197
All right, you're all
gonna have a major

19:19.271 --> 19:21.034
rain check or fire check
or something.

19:21.073 --> 19:23.507
But just be careful
getting out of here, okay?

19:23.542 --> 19:25.567
And if anybody
had too much to drink,

19:25.611 --> 19:27.408
find a designated driver.

19:27.446 --> 19:29.038
Thank you for coming out.

19:30.149 --> 19:31.309
l'll give you a lift,
all right?

19:35.821 --> 19:36.788
oh, God.

19:36.822 --> 19:38.312
How long is this gonna last?

19:38.357 --> 19:40.450
l don't know.

19:40.493 --> 19:42.518
How much did you have to drink?

19:42.561 --> 19:45.189
l think l'm all empty.

19:45.231 --> 19:46.357
You know what?

19:46.398 --> 19:47.922
l'm gonna go
get you some coffee, okay?

19:47.967 --> 19:49.059
No, don't go.

19:52.938 --> 19:55.668
l can't believe this house
is gonna burn down.

19:58.878 --> 20:00.243
Yep, that's right.

20:00.279 --> 20:02.110
And you're in the toilet.

20:11.624 --> 20:13.524
clare.

20:13.559 --> 20:15.220
clare, l didn't
do anything!

20:15.261 --> 20:16.353
You know what?
You're right.

20:16.395 --> 20:18.761
You were totally
helpless; you're right.

20:18.797 --> 20:20.389
Why do you always think
the worst of me?

20:20.432 --> 20:22.263
Because you've proven me
right so many times before.

20:22.301 --> 20:23.563
l didn't do anything.

20:23.602 --> 20:26.400
Listen, clare, if you need
a lift down the hill...

20:26.438 --> 20:27.405
That won't be necessary.

20:27.439 --> 20:29.066
Shut up, Steve.

20:29.108 --> 20:31.906
Thanks. Um, actually,
l'm-l'm not leaving yet.

20:31.944 --> 20:32.968
okay.

20:33.012 --> 20:34.036
can l call you sometime?

20:34.079 --> 20:35.239
No, you can't.

20:36.248 --> 20:37.738
Sure. Why not?

20:39.485 --> 20:41.749
l'll see you later.

20:41.787 --> 20:44.415
Bye.

20:46.091 --> 20:47.422
Why are you doing this to me?

20:47.459 --> 20:48.983
l love you.

20:49.028 --> 20:52.464
lf you haven't noticed, we're
in an emergency here, Steve.

20:52.498 --> 20:54.489
You are not an emergency.

21:20.359 --> 21:22.122
All right, l got the extra line.

21:22.161 --> 21:24.288
l'm gonna hook it up to
the source, meet you up top.

21:36.909 --> 21:38.137
You're blocking me in!

21:38.177 --> 21:39.144
Hey, calm down, man.

21:39.178 --> 21:40.270
Muntz, got ahold
of this guy.

21:40.379 --> 21:41.846
Get that car moving!

21:41.880 --> 21:42.938
Make sure everybody
has a ride!

21:42.982 --> 21:44.176
You should get
out of here, too.

21:44.216 --> 21:45.376
No way. l'm staying.

21:45.417 --> 21:47.385
oh, l wish we had a camera.

21:47.419 --> 21:48.886
Just chill, okay!

21:48.921 --> 21:51.219
l'll be back in a second.

21:54.727 --> 21:57.195
l can't go through this again.

22:05.604 --> 22:07.572
Say it with me, Kelly.

22:07.606 --> 22:10.074
''Thy kingdom come,

22:10.109 --> 22:12.839
''thy will be done,

22:12.878 --> 22:14.937
on earth as it is in heaven...''

22:18.550 --> 22:19.517
Help us!

22:21.020 --> 22:22.988
Help us!

22:34.767 --> 22:35.756
Kelly, are you okay?

22:35.801 --> 22:37.029
No, l'm not okay.

22:37.069 --> 22:38.229
What's the matter?

22:38.270 --> 22:39.931
Nothing. l ha-have a small
problem with fires

22:39.972 --> 22:41.405
in case you don't remember.

22:41.440 --> 22:42.907
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, l'm sure this
must be very upsetting....

22:42.941 --> 22:44.932
Save it, Brandon.

22:44.977 --> 22:47.411
You know what, Kel,
why don't you just go home

22:47.446 --> 22:49.414
and we'll talk about whatever's
bothering you later, okay?

22:49.448 --> 22:51.040
We have nothing to talk about.

22:53.519 --> 22:54.850
Why are you mad at me?

22:54.887 --> 22:55.615
You don't know?

22:55.654 --> 22:56.552
No, l don't know.

22:56.588 --> 22:58.283
The night of the fire, Brandon,

22:58.357 --> 23:00.723
l needed you
and you weren't there.

23:00.759 --> 23:02.021
l can't forget that!

23:02.061 --> 23:03.221
l'm not asking you to forget it.

23:03.262 --> 23:04.854
You know, you always thought
that l was mad at you

23:04.897 --> 23:06.694
because l thought you were off
sleeping with Emily Valentine.

23:06.732 --> 23:07.960
But that wasn't it, it was you!

23:08.000 --> 23:09.592
-lt was me? Uh-huh.
-You.

23:09.635 --> 23:12.763
the person l needed most in this
world was not there for me.

23:12.805 --> 23:14.898
You know what, Kelly?
l've apologized to you

23:14.940 --> 23:16.874
about this until l'm blue
in the face.

23:16.909 --> 23:17.876
l can't change it,

23:17.910 --> 23:20.037
-can l?!
-No, you can't.

23:20.079 --> 23:21.205
l gotta go.

23:21.246 --> 23:22.941
Drive safely.

23:22.981 --> 23:24.539
l'll talk to you later.

23:34.193 --> 23:35.285
Kelly?

23:40.599 --> 23:41.930
l thought you were leaving.

23:41.967 --> 23:43.901
l'm trying to.

23:43.936 --> 23:45.267
So what's stopping you?

23:45.304 --> 23:49.263
l'm scared to go, but l'm scared
to stay, you know?

23:49.341 --> 23:51.275
Well, l'll make it easy for you.

23:51.310 --> 23:52.675
Move over.
l'll drive you home.

23:52.711 --> 23:54.144
You... lt's your house.

23:54.179 --> 23:55.441
l know, it's just a house.

23:55.481 --> 23:57.244
You're more important.

23:57.282 --> 23:58.772
You mean that, don't you?

23:58.817 --> 23:59.784
of course l do.

24:01.887 --> 24:03.650
Go on back. l'll be fine.

24:03.689 --> 24:05.657
okay.

24:19.738 --> 24:21.672
Hey, you got more hoses?

24:21.707 --> 24:23.436
There's one on the side
of the house and two up front.

24:23.475 --> 24:24.567
All right, bro.
l got the front.

24:24.610 --> 24:25.599
l'll take the side.

24:28.647 --> 24:30.342
Give me one of those.

24:30.382 --> 24:32.407
Kel, what are you
still doing here? Go home.

24:32.451 --> 24:34.146
Brandon, l need
to do this, all right?

24:34.186 --> 24:35.653
No, you don't.
Get out of here!

24:35.687 --> 24:37.052
-Give me the hose.
-Fine.

24:44.129 --> 24:45.619
Guys, let's go.
Let's get a line started

24:45.664 --> 24:46.790
at the top of this ridge.

24:46.832 --> 24:48.459
chainsaws up front.
Let's move it.

24:54.072 --> 24:56.370
Hey, hey, we're
losing pressure.

24:56.408 --> 24:57.466
Yeah, here, too.

24:57.509 --> 24:58.840
The fire department
must have

24:58.877 --> 25:00.208
every hydrant
on the hill going.

25:00.245 --> 25:01.769
We have a sump pump
for the pool.

25:01.814 --> 25:03.645
-We can switch to that.
-Yeah, let's do it.

25:03.682 --> 25:04.979
oh, yeah? All right,
l'll get it.

25:05.017 --> 25:06.382
No, stay here.
l'll get it.

25:06.418 --> 25:07.885
Does this mean
you forgive me?

25:07.920 --> 25:09.615
No, it means
you're a hoser.

25:11.089 --> 25:12.215
Who's the owner of this
property?

25:12.257 --> 25:13.815
Uh, my father is,
but l live here.

25:13.859 --> 25:15.656
Sir, it's my obligation

25:15.694 --> 25:17.559
to inform you that you're in
the path of a dangerous fire.

25:17.596 --> 25:19.587
lt's the recommendation of the
Los Angeles Fire Department

25:19.631 --> 25:20.723
that all residents evacuate
immediately.

25:20.766 --> 25:22.427
Well, is there some law against
us staying here?

25:22.467 --> 25:23.764
No, sir, it's not,

25:23.802 --> 25:25.326
but could l have the name
of your next of kin, please?

25:26.605 --> 25:28.664
Look, this is
your last chance to leave.

25:28.707 --> 25:30.106
We're gonna be running hoses
across the street.

25:30.142 --> 25:31.939
Well, l'm sorry,
l'm not leaving, okay?

25:31.977 --> 25:32.773
We're staying, sir.

25:35.948 --> 25:38.246
All right, just don't try
to be heroes.

25:38.283 --> 25:41.343
We'll cover you the best we can.
Be careful. And good luck.

25:43.622 --> 25:46.056
Hey, maybe we should go.
This could be a big mistake.

26:00.239 --> 26:02.104
We need more personnel
on the line!

26:07.512 --> 26:10.640
of all the brushfires that are
blazing across the Southland

26:10.682 --> 26:13.981
on this hot, windy day, the one
that poses the greatest threat

26:14.019 --> 26:16.681
to expensive homes in the area
is in the Hollywood Hills.

26:16.722 --> 26:18.815
Reporter Gail Reichenberg is
on the scene. Gail.

26:18.857 --> 26:21.758
We're up on Deronda Drive,
Harry,

26:21.793 --> 26:24.887
just a stone's throw
from the famous Hollywood sign.

26:24.930 --> 26:27.524
As firefighters combat
the encroaching blaze,

26:27.566 --> 26:30.433
courageous area residents stand
on rooftops.

26:30.469 --> 26:33.199
They're desperately trying to
wet down as much as they can

26:33.238 --> 26:36.503
before sparks fanned
by these high winds ignite

26:36.541 --> 26:38.338
their expensive hillside homes.

26:38.377 --> 26:41.972
No structures have burned yet,
but the fire department warns

26:42.014 --> 26:44.244
that fires like this are
unpredictable.

26:44.349 --> 26:47.250
We've been told that
in situations like this

26:47.286 --> 26:49.811
many residents need to go back
home, or feel they need

26:49.855 --> 26:52.153
to go back home to retrieve
family heirlooms or pets...

26:52.190 --> 26:53.179
Where have you been?

26:53.225 --> 26:54.487
l don't feel so good.

26:54.526 --> 26:56.153
Some help you are.

26:56.194 --> 26:57.684
Shut up, Steve.

26:59.231 --> 27:01.199
Has anybody seen Donna around?

27:01.233 --> 27:02.393
Yeah, she's outside with clare.

27:02.434 --> 27:03.628
They're having trouble
with the sump.

27:03.669 --> 27:04.863
Hey,

27:04.903 --> 27:06.063
can l get you a shot
of tequila?

27:06.104 --> 27:07.628
That's very funny.

27:14.813 --> 27:17.543
The sump's down again.

27:17.582 --> 27:20.016
Mark said there's more gas
in the garage.

27:20.052 --> 27:21.417
okay.

27:29.728 --> 27:32.060
clare.

27:32.097 --> 27:33.724
clare, come here!

27:35.067 --> 27:36.034
What?

27:36.068 --> 27:39.196
Look, it's the same deer.

27:39.237 --> 27:41.000
So much for good luck.

27:41.039 --> 27:42.506
Poor thing.
l wonder where its mother went.

27:42.541 --> 27:43.667
To get a pedicure?

27:43.709 --> 27:44.937
clare, this isn't funny.
l'm worried.

27:44.977 --> 27:47.138
A baby deer out in the woods
alone during a fire.

27:47.179 --> 27:48.544
lt could get killed.

27:48.580 --> 27:50.377
Don, you've seen Bambi
too many times.

27:50.415 --> 27:51.746
l'm sure it's fine.

27:51.783 --> 27:53.774
can you imagine how scared
she is out there all alone?

27:53.819 --> 27:56.083
lt's an animal.
lt lives ''out there.''

27:56.121 --> 27:57.884
No, you don't understand.

27:57.923 --> 28:00.756
No, l guess l don't.

28:03.795 --> 28:05.763
Well, now you look presentable.

28:05.797 --> 28:07.890
Did l get all the
Honey Dust off my face?

28:07.933 --> 28:09.867
Yes, you look great.

28:09.901 --> 28:12.096
l wish you didn't have to go
back to the office.

28:12.137 --> 28:13.104
lt's Saturday.

28:13.138 --> 28:14.605
Don't remind me.

28:14.639 --> 28:16.038
Well, you better go before
you're late.

28:17.242 --> 28:18.266
You sound like a wife.

28:23.048 --> 28:26.142
You sure don't kiss
like one though.

28:26.184 --> 28:27.481
l love you.

28:27.519 --> 28:30.010
Hmm, l love you.

28:30.055 --> 28:31.454
Don't make any plans tonight,
okay?

28:31.490 --> 28:32.923
Why not?

28:32.958 --> 28:34.949
Because we are spending it
together.

28:34.993 --> 28:36.358
All night?

28:36.395 --> 28:37.657
All night, baby.

28:37.696 --> 28:39.220
Well, you better hurry home.

28:39.264 --> 28:41.528
l will.

29:03.622 --> 29:05.317
okay, we're getting
a break here.

29:05.357 --> 29:06.517
The wind's shifting out.

29:06.558 --> 29:07.684
Looks like you guys are
gonna make it.

29:07.726 --> 29:08.693
All right!

29:08.727 --> 29:10.024
Save your water, though.

29:10.062 --> 29:11.324
clare, kill the pump.

29:15.033 --> 29:16.762
All right,
is everybody okay?

29:16.802 --> 29:17.928
Are we all
accounted for?

29:17.969 --> 29:18.993
Yeah, yeah, l think so.

29:19.037 --> 29:20.834
Where's Kelly?

29:20.872 --> 29:22.100
She's inside.
l just saw her.

29:22.140 --> 29:23.004
What about Donna?

29:24.242 --> 29:25.436
l don't know.

29:25.477 --> 29:26.944
l haven't seen much of her
all day.

29:26.978 --> 29:28.138
Well, that's because she's been
playing nursemaid

29:28.180 --> 29:29.147
to the town drunk.

29:29.181 --> 29:30.273
That's very funny, Steve.

29:31.249 --> 29:32.181
oh, my God.

29:33.218 --> 29:35.209
She was worried about this baby
deer down the hill.

29:35.320 --> 29:37.220
Great, clare.
She didn't go after it, did she?

29:37.322 --> 29:38.380
l don't know.

29:38.423 --> 29:39.515
Well, when's the last time
you saw her?

29:39.558 --> 29:40.718
Like, a half an hour ago.

29:40.759 --> 29:41.691
That hillside's covered
in brush.

29:41.726 --> 29:42.818
lt could go up anytime.

29:42.861 --> 29:44.226
Yeah, we should split up
and go look for her.

29:44.262 --> 29:45.490
There's a hook and ladder
down the street.

29:45.530 --> 29:46.497
l'm gonna go tell 'em
we're missing somebody.

29:46.531 --> 29:47.862
okay, l'm going.

30:32.277 --> 30:35.337
Now who's more helpless,
you or me?

30:37.949 --> 30:42.682
Don't just stand there,
scream for help.

30:42.721 --> 30:46.282
Help! Help!

30:47.993 --> 30:50.223
That was effective.

30:50.262 --> 30:52.253
l guess we just have
to wait it out.

30:52.297 --> 30:55.198
Hope someone finds us
before it gets dark.

31:14.886 --> 31:16.251
Hello.

31:16.288 --> 31:19.086
Valerie, Valerie,
l thought l'd missed you.

31:19.124 --> 31:20.591
l was just picking up
some dinner.

31:20.625 --> 31:23.458
oh. oh, dinner.

31:23.495 --> 31:25.258
What's going on?

31:25.297 --> 31:27.094
Uh, what?

31:27.132 --> 31:28.622
Well, you sound
completely weird.

31:28.667 --> 31:31.568
Yeah, well, l've just been
on the phone with my lawyer

31:31.603 --> 31:32.592
for the last hour.

31:32.637 --> 31:33.729
About what?

31:33.772 --> 31:36.138
lt's not gonna be as easy
as l thought.

31:36.174 --> 31:37.573
So what's that supposed to mean?

31:37.609 --> 31:40.669
Well, it means that her lawyer
is on the warpath already,

31:40.712 --> 31:42.737
and my lawyer doesn't want me
to do anything foolish.

31:42.781 --> 31:43.941
So that means me?

31:43.982 --> 31:46.382
l don't know.
l-l-l don't know.

31:46.418 --> 31:47.646
Why are you so angry?

31:47.686 --> 31:48.914
l'm not angry!

31:48.954 --> 31:50.285
Honey, it's just, it's just

31:50.355 --> 31:52.152
not going down the way
that l thought.

31:52.190 --> 31:54.784
l mean, l could lose everything.

31:54.826 --> 31:55.884
Excuse me.

31:55.927 --> 31:58.452
You need to sign these
here and here.

32:00.865 --> 32:03.060
l just, l wasn't prepared
for this.

32:03.101 --> 32:04.591
What did you think
was gonna happen?

32:04.636 --> 32:05.830
certainly not this.

32:05.870 --> 32:07.428
So we're off for tonight,
aren't we?

32:07.472 --> 32:09.963
For tonight, unfortunately, yes.

32:10.008 --> 32:11.805
can you handle that?

32:11.843 --> 32:13.834
No, l can't.

32:30.061 --> 32:31.085
Help!

32:31.129 --> 32:32.926
We're down here!

32:32.964 --> 32:35.455
Help us!

32:35.500 --> 32:38.799
Your mother must be worried
about you out here

32:38.837 --> 32:40.395
all alone in the hills.

32:40.438 --> 32:42.963
You're gonna be fine, okay?

32:43.008 --> 32:45.841
We're gonna be fine.

32:45.877 --> 32:47.606
Help!

33:03.561 --> 33:05.222
Are you sure
she just didn't go home?

33:05.263 --> 33:06.525
No, her car's still
at the house.

33:06.564 --> 33:07.963
Well, maybe she caught a lift
down the hill.

33:07.999 --> 33:09.398
Man, this is all
my fault.

33:09.434 --> 33:11.061
l should have been
looking out for her.

33:11.102 --> 33:12.126
-Hey, hey.
-Look, all right,

33:12.170 --> 33:13.034
l got some guys working
their way

33:13.071 --> 33:14.163
back up the hillside, all right?

33:14.205 --> 33:15.638
lf she's on that hill,
they'll spot her.

33:15.674 --> 33:17.539
How bad is it down there?

33:17.575 --> 33:19.133
Well, let's just say if the wind
shifts, that brush is gonna go.

33:19.177 --> 33:21.077
Plus, that smoke is
really thick.

33:21.112 --> 33:23.046
But don't worry,
we're gonna find your friend.

33:24.382 --> 33:25.747
come on, let's go
back to the house.

33:25.784 --> 33:27.581
l'm never
getting drunk again.

33:27.619 --> 33:28.745
l'll hold you to that.

33:28.787 --> 33:30.914
You don't have to.

33:33.291 --> 33:35.259
Help!

33:35.360 --> 33:37.385
Somebody help!

33:37.429 --> 33:38.760
Keep clearing
that brush, guys.

33:38.797 --> 33:40.389
over here!
We're down here!

33:40.432 --> 33:42.525
Wait!

33:42.567 --> 33:43.625
Hey, you hear that?

33:43.668 --> 33:45.602
Help!

33:45.637 --> 33:47.832
We hear you!

33:47.872 --> 33:49.772
Just a second!
We're coming down!

33:49.808 --> 33:50.934
Help!

33:52.477 --> 33:53.739
This way!

33:56.381 --> 33:59.839
Help! over here.

33:59.884 --> 34:02.182
over here, we're over here!

34:02.220 --> 34:04.450
come on, guys!

34:04.489 --> 34:07.253
Boy, am l glad to see you.

34:10.328 --> 34:12.592
Really glad.

34:12.630 --> 34:13.597
Are you hurt?

34:13.630 --> 34:15.428
What? oh...

34:15.467 --> 34:18.027
Yeah, my knee, my knee
hurts really badly.

34:18.069 --> 34:19.536
What are you doing down here?

34:19.571 --> 34:21.094
The fawn, she lost her mother.

34:21.139 --> 34:23.607
l was just trying
to get her out.

34:23.641 --> 34:26.610
Well, what do you say
we get you two out of here?

34:26.643 --> 34:28.339
lf you just put your
arms around my neck

34:28.380 --> 34:30.074
-and hold on tight,
l'll get you out. -okay.

34:30.114 --> 34:31.206
So, what's your name?

34:31.248 --> 34:32.409
Donna, Donna Martin.

34:32.449 --> 34:33.940
cliff Yeager.

34:36.121 --> 34:38.987
lt's really nice
to meet you.

35:01.546 --> 35:03.605
Fire crews in the
Hollywood Hills

35:03.648 --> 35:06.515
report that the last hotspot
is finally under control,

35:06.551 --> 35:09.019
and that cleanup operations
are underway.

35:09.053 --> 35:11.487
But these firemen are going
to have a very long night.

35:11.523 --> 35:13.582
Thank God it's over.

35:14.859 --> 35:16.690
Any word?

35:16.728 --> 35:18.491
No, they're still
looking for her.

35:18.530 --> 35:19.497
They'll find her.

35:19.531 --> 35:21.021
Uh, they, they already did.

35:21.065 --> 35:24.228
Well, Harry, at least one of our

35:24.302 --> 35:26.236
stories today
has a happy ending.

35:26.304 --> 35:27.828
This is Donna Martin,

35:27.872 --> 35:29.840
a california University senior,

35:29.874 --> 35:32.035
who risked her own safety

35:32.076 --> 35:35.944
to rescue our very own
real life Bambi.

35:35.980 --> 35:37.777
Donna, tell us what happened.

35:37.816 --> 35:40.182
Well, it wasn't
really a big deal.

35:40.218 --> 35:41.742
And the truth is,

35:41.786 --> 35:44.050
if anyone deserves
the credit, it's him.

35:44.088 --> 35:45.646
He's your local hero.

35:45.690 --> 35:46.657
Excuse me, sir,

35:46.691 --> 35:47.749
what's your name?

35:47.792 --> 35:48.759
cliff Yeager.

35:48.793 --> 35:50.385
Firefighter cliff Yeager

35:50.428 --> 35:52.225
and Donna Martin.

35:52.263 --> 35:53.628
Two reluctant heroes

35:53.665 --> 35:55.530
whose selfless actions

35:55.567 --> 35:57.262
under the circumstances
point out

35:57.368 --> 35:59.802
the very best instincts
in human nature.

35:59.838 --> 36:03.205
l guess some girls will
do anything to get a date.

36:03.241 --> 36:05.937
Well, come on, guys.
Dinner's on me.

36:05.977 --> 36:08.002
Well, that's the least
you could do after we saved

36:08.046 --> 36:09.479
your house
from burning, huh?

36:09.514 --> 36:10.572
You got it.

36:10.615 --> 36:12.378
Good. l'm hungry.

36:23.528 --> 36:25.223
Hey, Nat!

36:25.296 --> 36:27.230
-Kelly?
-Yeah?

36:27.298 --> 36:28.322
can l ask you something?

36:28.366 --> 36:29.333
-Sure.
-l know you used to

36:29.367 --> 36:30.425
go out with Brandon

36:30.468 --> 36:31.457
and l was wondering

36:31.503 --> 36:32.868
why you guys broke up.

36:32.904 --> 36:34.701
As far as l can tell,
he's perfect.

36:34.739 --> 36:35.763
Nobody's perfect.

36:37.809 --> 36:39.902
l couldn't have said
it better myself.

36:45.116 --> 36:46.242
Quite a night
tonight, huh?

36:46.351 --> 36:48.717
l saw Donna on TV.
She gonna be all right?

36:48.753 --> 36:50.380
Yeah, yeah, she's fine,
David's on his way over

36:50.421 --> 36:52.048
to the hospital to
pick her up right now.

36:52.090 --> 36:53.887
So, who's the pretty lady?

36:53.925 --> 36:56.485
oh, you, l'm sorry.

36:56.528 --> 36:58.462
This is c.U.'s
anchorwoman, Tracy.

36:58.496 --> 36:59.963
Tracy, Nat,
Nat, Tracy.

36:59.998 --> 37:01.295
Nice to meet you.

37:01.332 --> 37:02.390
Nice to meet you.

37:02.433 --> 37:03.832
He said l should
get the megaburger.

37:03.868 --> 37:05.665
Sure, the first one's
always on me.

37:05.703 --> 37:07.864
Just like a drug dealer,

37:07.906 --> 37:09.305
gives you the
first one for free,

37:09.340 --> 37:11.672
charges you second
for the double-- what?

37:11.709 --> 37:13.006
oh, my God!

37:13.044 --> 37:14.739
You should have been
there, it was awesome!

37:14.779 --> 37:16.679
Fire raged all around us.

37:16.714 --> 37:18.739
lt was like the classic battle:
Man versus nature.

37:18.783 --> 37:19.943
Good versus evil.

37:19.984 --> 37:21.451
We fought and we won.

37:21.486 --> 37:22.953
-Awesome.
-Don't worry.

37:22.987 --> 37:24.545
You'll probably only have
to listen to this story

37:24.589 --> 37:26.887
for about two
more centuries.

37:26.925 --> 37:28.722
Excuse me,
l think five times

37:28.760 --> 37:31.627
is probably enough for me,
considering l was there.

37:31.663 --> 37:33.654
ls it me or is she
icier than usual?

37:33.698 --> 37:35.962
lt's me.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.399
clare!

37:37.435 --> 37:39.062
come on, knock it off.

37:39.103 --> 37:40.434
What's the big deal?

37:40.471 --> 37:42.701
All you ever do is screw up
and say you're sorry.

37:42.740 --> 37:44.537
This time, you didn't
even have the decency to say

37:44.576 --> 37:45.543
you were sorry.

37:45.577 --> 37:47.135
How long are you
going to punish me, huh?

37:47.178 --> 37:48.645
l'm sorry, okay?

37:48.680 --> 37:50.011
No, it's not okay.

37:50.048 --> 37:51.481
For months now,

37:51.516 --> 37:54.781
all we ever do is fight
and make up, fight and make up.

37:54.819 --> 37:56.548
lt's like a game;
l'm sick of it.

37:56.588 --> 37:58.385
Are you saying you
want to break up?

37:58.423 --> 38:02.359
Yeah, that's what l'm saying.

38:10.435 --> 38:11.402
Hi.

38:11.436 --> 38:12.562
Hi.

38:12.604 --> 38:14.333
Listen, about before...

38:14.372 --> 38:15.430
No, forget it.

38:15.473 --> 38:17.373
-No.
-No, it's fine.

38:17.408 --> 38:19.876
Don't worry about it.

38:24.616 --> 38:26.311
-Hey, man.
-Hey, you got any quarters?

38:26.351 --> 38:28.444
l'm playing Kelly's
favorite songs.

38:28.486 --> 38:29.783
oh, boy, here you go.

38:29.821 --> 38:31.049
Thanks.

38:31.089 --> 38:34.388
Listen, uh, just
for the record,

38:34.425 --> 38:36.552
l know you and Kelly
have a history together

38:36.594 --> 38:38.221
and l just kinda wanted to

38:38.262 --> 38:39.695
clear things with you before...

38:39.731 --> 38:41.392
You want to ask her out.

38:41.432 --> 38:42.763
Well, actually,
l already did.

38:42.800 --> 38:44.563
You okay with that?

38:44.602 --> 38:46.229
Absolutely.
Kelly's a big girl.

38:46.304 --> 38:47.771
She can make
her own decisions.

38:47.805 --> 38:49.773
All right, cool.

38:53.311 --> 38:54.676
Did you miss me?

38:54.712 --> 38:56.612
Yeah, what was
that all about?

38:56.648 --> 38:58.582
What, you mean
me and Brandon?

38:58.616 --> 39:00.550
No, nothing, it was
just some talk.

39:00.585 --> 39:01.950
Just some newsroom
stuff, that's all.

39:01.986 --> 39:03.954
Right.

39:03.988 --> 39:07.617
okay, actually,
the truth is,

39:07.659 --> 39:09.024
l told him that
we were gonna go out.

39:09.060 --> 39:12.518
oh, and we need his
permission to do that?

39:12.563 --> 39:14.053
That's funny.
That's what he said.

39:14.098 --> 39:17.090
Well, Brandon is a smart guy.

39:17.135 --> 39:19.035
l'm gonna ask you one more time.

39:20.271 --> 39:22.102
Do you want to have dinner
with me tomorrow night?

39:22.140 --> 39:23.198
Hmm, l don't know.

39:23.274 --> 39:24.536
l'd have to ask Brandon first.

39:27.845 --> 39:29.039
Brando?

39:29.080 --> 39:30.547
Yeah.

39:30.581 --> 39:32.310
They look kind of
chummy, don't they?

39:34.585 --> 39:36.382
So?

39:36.421 --> 39:38.048
25 years ago,
l let Joanie slip away.

39:38.089 --> 39:39.818
Don't make the same mistake.

39:39.857 --> 39:42.291
Yeah, yeah, l'll see ya, Nat.

40:00.812 --> 40:03.246
Take it easy.

40:03.281 --> 40:05.579
lt's just a sprain.

40:05.616 --> 40:06.947
Yeah, l know.

40:06.984 --> 40:09.214
But l've got a lot
to make up to you.

40:09.253 --> 40:11.778
Well, thanks for
coming to get me.

40:11.823 --> 40:14.257
l'm just trying to salvage
a horrible day.

40:14.325 --> 40:16.555
Well, you're doing
a good job now.

40:16.594 --> 40:19.791
There you go.

40:19.831 --> 40:21.594
l just want you
to know that, uh,

40:21.632 --> 40:23.998
you can count on me
as a friend.

40:24.035 --> 40:25.935
That's sweet of you, David.

40:25.970 --> 40:26.937
Thank you.

40:26.971 --> 40:29.531
Thank you for
taking care of me.

40:29.574 --> 40:31.838
Do you want to stay for awhile?

40:31.876 --> 40:33.503
You know what, uh,

40:33.544 --> 40:34.943
will you be
okay by yourself?

40:34.979 --> 40:36.606
Yeah, sure.

40:36.647 --> 40:38.706
Great, l got to get going;
l need to get some sleep.

40:40.051 --> 40:41.518
Are you sure you'll be okay?

40:41.552 --> 40:42.576
l'm positive.

40:42.620 --> 40:43.644
Good night.

40:44.689 --> 40:46.987
Good night.

40:50.027 --> 40:51.585
l'll talk to you tomorrow.

40:51.629 --> 40:53.392
okay.

41:01.272 --> 41:03.365
come on in.

41:05.710 --> 41:08.338
-Valerie, hi.
-Hi.

41:08.379 --> 41:11.246
Your secretary said
you were working late.

41:11.315 --> 41:13.249
lt's Saturday night.

41:13.284 --> 41:14.251
Doesn't Diane mind?

41:14.352 --> 41:16.912
This is not a good time, honey.

41:16.954 --> 41:18.546
Well, it won't take long,
l just thought maybe

41:18.589 --> 41:19.851
you should be the
first one to know.

41:19.891 --> 41:21.222
Know what? What?

41:25.963 --> 41:27.021
l'm pregnant.

41:33.104 --> 41:34.833
Here's the little test.

41:34.872 --> 41:36.737
lt's amazing how simple it is.

41:36.774 --> 41:37.900
Blue if you're pregnant.

41:37.942 --> 41:39.705
Pink if you're not.

41:44.048 --> 41:45.379
You'll notice it's bright blue.

41:45.416 --> 41:47.077
Daddy.
