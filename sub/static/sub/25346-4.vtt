Bobby, who are we doing this week?

00:23.732 --> 00:25.108
Jason Vogelsang.

00:25.191 --> 00:27.902
He is 48, 6 foot, 165.

00:27.986 --> 00:31.072
Jason is a handyman that can fix
just about anything.

00:31.156 --> 00:34.659
His relationship status is single
and he's open to dating.

00:34.743 --> 00:35.577
Oh, nice.

00:35.660 --> 00:39.456
He was nominated by his best friend Beth
and she adores Jason.

00:39.539 --> 00:40.874
Could he date her?

00:40.957 --> 00:44.210
It's best friends, I think
they might be in the friend zone.

00:44.294 --> 00:45.420

I love that the Burning group
is like gays, we get to pick our family.

00:58.183 --> 01:02.645
My dear friend Beth nominated me.
I think it's obvious why.

01:02.729 --> 01:08.693
Jason's style...
granola meets aging hipster.

01:08.777 --> 01:11.654
This is typically my style right here.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.865
I'm just not a very vain person.

Everything is mostly functional.

01:16.367 --> 01:18.578
[Beth] Jason is a paradox.

01:18.661 --> 01:20.830
He does resist change

01:20.914 --> 01:23.750
but I think deep down

01:23.833 --> 01:26.085
he knows that it's time.

it ties into my love of Burning Man.

01:41.100 --> 01:44.979
As far as my career is concerned,
it's something I wanna redefine

a specific direction

01:47.941 --> 01:52.195

nice to have a fresh perspective.

I just would love for the Fab 5
to help Jason build up his confidence

01:57.075 --> 02:01.913

control of the next part of his life.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.805
-He holds my life together.
-Aw.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.307
He does that for a lot of people.

02:21.391 --> 02:26.104
And in the process, he doesn't
necessarily make himself a priority.

02:26.187 --> 02:28.648

to Reno?

02:28.731 --> 02:30.984

without Jason.

02:35.530 --> 02:38.950
It'll be good for him
for the next phase in his life,

-This is cow lung that the dog eats.

[Karamo] Oh, that's disgusting.

10:21.537 --> 10:23.998
-[Antoni] Oh, what's that?
-You gonna sniff it?

10:24.081 --> 10:25.666
Did you just taste it?

10:26.375 --> 10:29.795
You can't put everything in your mouth
and up your nose.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.005
That's really hot.

10:31.756 --> 10:34.216
It's making me sneeze. [sneezes]

10:34.300 --> 10:38.346
What's a morning in the life of Jason?
Do you spend time on yourself?

10:38.429 --> 10:40.473
-No. No.
-Just like take a shower?

10:40.556 --> 10:43.476
Take a shower.
I don't really have any product.

10:43.559 --> 10:44.977
I struggle with shampoo.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.396
The ingredients in this
are not working.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.899
Sodium lauryl sulfate,
the same thing

10:49.982 --> 10:52.276
that cleans the carburetor of a car.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.070
-Wow.
-It is hardcore.

10:54.153 --> 10:55.863
It's like an AK47, you know.

10:55.946 --> 10:56.947
It is not gentle.

10:57.031 --> 10:59.950
For curly hair that's porous,
we do not want that.

11:00.034 --> 11:03.788
I'm way open to any advice
you have 'cause I've never known.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.456
Also as far as the look.

11:05.539 --> 11:08.834
Maybe polish it up
but still keep your boho vibe.

attractive, honey.

-Put those Magnums to work.
-Whoo!

11:14.090 --> 11:16.884
-I wanna see your fridge.
-Not much to see.

11:17.426 --> 11:20.471
I don't even have anything
that I can criticize

11:20.554 --> 11:22.306
because there is nothing in here.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.475
My meals are simple and functional.

11:24.558 --> 11:26.894
But it's a convenient thing.

11:26.977 --> 11:28.896
[Antoni] Functional eater, my ass.

11:28.979 --> 11:31.357
You're supposed to enjoy spice, texture.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.652
Something that's fried,
something that's raw.

11:34.735 --> 11:37.780
-What cuisine are you interested in?
-Um, I love Indian.

11:37.863 --> 11:38.697
Oh, nice.

11:38.781 --> 11:42.159
It's something I'd like to make
'cause I do love the food.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.327
Do you cook?

11:43.411 --> 11:44.954
Frozen veggie burger.

11:45.037 --> 11:48.666
I have nuts and probably
some microwave meals.

11:48.749 --> 11:50.960
You're not being good to this.

11:51.043 --> 11:51.961
Right. Right.

11:52.044 --> 11:55.047
-Ew, why is it sticky? Ew!
-Just get it off, get it off.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.008
Hey, stop touching my stuff.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.093

-Hey.
-Let me find a chair.

How else can we help you?

12:05.015 --> 12:08.686
I don't know if you know,
but I'm planning a going-away party.

12:08.769 --> 12:10.229
-Oh, nice.
-Cool.

12:10.312 --> 12:12.231
We should help you plan.

12:12.314 --> 12:14.233
-[laughs]
-[Jason] I might need help.

12:14.316 --> 12:17.278
Are you transporting these things
you've collected?

12:17.361 --> 12:19.947
I'm gonna try
to get rid of a bulk of it.

12:20.030 --> 12:23.909
What if we have a silent auction?
Line up some cool things

12:23.993 --> 12:25.744
to help fund your move.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.997
-[Karamo] Great idea.
-[Bobby] That's a great way

12:28.080 --> 12:29.915
for friends to have a piece of you,

12:29.999 --> 12:32.835
-then it helps fund your trip.
-Great, brilliant.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.254
[Tan] Are you open to all of these things?

12:35.337 --> 12:37.006
-Very much, very much.
-[Tan] Good.

he needs while he's in Atlanta,

to make this move successfully,
seeing a goal and finishing it.

12:52.897 --> 12:53.814

[Bobby] I don't need to teach Jason taste,
he has it.

I need to show
how to translate that into a home.

13:00.404 --> 13:02.406
[Antoni] I want him to get excited
about food

13:02.490 --> 13:04.033
like when you hear a song you love

13:04.116 --> 13:06.118
or see a painting
that makes you think.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.703
The same should happen with food.

13:08.287 --> 13:11.665
[Karamo] Jason needs structure
in his life. He's complacent.

13:11.749 --> 13:15.419
And the problem with that
is that you get to a place

13:15.503 --> 13:18.756
where you just don't wanna try
anymore.

13:18.839 --> 13:20.216
[Tan] No more painter Jason.

Yes, it's something
I don't know enough about.

13:35.481 --> 13:39.193
I wanna try to embrace it a bit
and get more experience.

13:39.276 --> 13:41.737
What we do here is we're a chaat house.

13:41.820 --> 13:44.573
Chaat means like savory snack.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.659
Lot of crispy,
street vendor foods.

13:47.243 --> 13:50.663
What's great about this spot,
it's fast, casual, easy dining.

Can I?

14:05.302 --> 14:07.137
Yeah.

I make this with my mom.
But it's been a long time.

Really flour up your hands
and get a small ball and then roll it.

-[Jason] Mm-hm.
-Spin it in between each roll.

14:18.482 --> 14:20.901
You get a little bit more
on this side.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.319

-Yeah.

to fix things up and sell them,

16:10.094 --> 16:11.637
he never got around to it.

the president of Home Depot.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.768
He'll never work for the man.

16:17.851 --> 16:20.479

"This is good enough."

-Yes.

-Why has it not happened?
-He's got incredible friends.

16:50.718 --> 16:54.096
I think that that's a tough thing
to cut or leave.

16:54.179 --> 16:59.476
I have never thought he really knew
how important he was to this community.

17:00.060 --> 17:03.147
We've been surprised
at how willing he was to leave.

Why are you moving
to the other side of the country,

17:06.191 --> 17:08.902

that have been in your life?

17:08.986 --> 17:12.489
We think of him as family.
Like, he's like our brother.

Like, "Do you not get it?"

17:15.951 --> 17:17.953

17:18.037 --> 17:19.830
[Michael] I don't think he realizes it.

17:19.913 --> 17:22.541

is he doesn't have a plan.

and goes where the wind takes him.

-I recognize those.
-I stole them from your house.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.771

When you're doing pieces
you want to sell,

18:28.607 --> 18:30.943
it's best to do things
that are neutral.

he's found

18:41.078 --> 18:43.080
and turning them into cool pieces

18:43.163 --> 18:45.833
he can use in the silent auction
at his party

18:45.916 --> 18:47.417
and make some money.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.461

and make them modern.

All right.

-Good answer.

-something that has dual purpose.
-Work space.

-Cool.

20:05.204 --> 20:09.374
Did you hear that 12 years ago
and then you just reminded yourself now?

20:09.458 --> 20:10.500
They're so functional.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.920
A muumuu is functional
but I don't want you in it.

20:13.003 --> 20:14.838
[Jason] Fair enough.

20:14.922 --> 20:17.216
Everything I saw in your closet,
a lot didn't work,

20:17.299 --> 20:19.301
but there were options
that did.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.887
I took inspiration from them
and brought you here.

20:21.970 --> 20:25.057
It's making more of an effort
to get what you want.

20:25.140 --> 20:28.810
It's very boho. I know you don't like
the word hippie. Why?

20:28.894 --> 20:31.939
Um, I guess I don't really classify
myself as a hippie.

20:32.022 --> 20:33.565
-Is this not hippie?
-A little.

20:33.649 --> 20:37.277
That's actually the Burning Man symbol.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.446
It is? Okay. I actually love that.

20:39.529 --> 20:42.699
That will tie in perfectly
with what we'll pick.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.785
-Linens.
-[Jason] I do like linens.

20:44.868 --> 20:47.996
It's hotter than hell out here
and where you're going,

20:48.080 --> 20:50.207
-it's not that much cooler.
-Hotter.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.959
Yeah, so linens are perfect.

20:52.042 --> 20:54.711
Stick with natural fabrics.
Cottons, linens.

20:54.795 --> 20:57.839
Anything that's a silk blend as well
that's gonna breathe.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.258
-This is beautiful.
-Cool.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.760
For your coloring,
this could be perfect.

21:01.843 --> 21:06.640
One thing that we talked about
was that you don't have Jason.

21:06.723 --> 21:08.934
You have handyman, you have burner.

21:09.017 --> 21:13.146
I wanna find a version
that sits in the middle of these two guys

21:13.230 --> 21:15.232
that makes sense for regular life.

21:15.315 --> 21:19.403
-I like it, okay.
-Let's get you to try on some clothes.

21:19.486 --> 21:21.697
-Okay, Jason how you doing?
-I'm good.

21:22.197 --> 21:24.408
-How's it looking?
-It's coming along.

21:24.491 --> 21:26.576
Good. If you wanna pop those on.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.287
Comfortable? Like the way it looks?

21:28.370 --> 21:29.746
-Feels very comfortable.
-Yeah.

21:29.830 --> 21:33.208
-It's different.
-If it gets cool in the evening.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.543
-Over the shirt?
-Yeah.

21:36.378 --> 21:37.504
I like this.

21:37.587 --> 21:40.173
I like that there's a bit of the shirt.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.301
[Jason] My first skinny pants.

21:42.384 --> 21:45.846
If we make sure things are fitting right
and not boxy,

21:45.929 --> 21:47.764
you'll look taller and slimmer.

21:47.848 --> 21:49.433
It's still very much you.

21:49.516 --> 21:52.436
-It's just definitely a more...
-Elevated.

21:52.519 --> 21:54.980
An elevated
and refined version of you.

21:55.063 --> 21:57.649
-Ready for the next one?
-What you got?

21:58.483 --> 22:01.028
I like that.
If you wanna slip those on.

22:01.111 --> 22:02.029
Gotcha.

22:02.112 --> 22:03.405
And the final piece.

22:03.697 --> 22:05.073
Let's put this on you.

22:05.657 --> 22:06.575
Oh, no.

22:06.700 --> 22:07.784
[laughing]

22:08.076 --> 22:09.244
-No? Yes.
-Yes.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.038
It looks like trouble though.

22:11.121 --> 22:13.373
This feels good. I like this.

22:13.457 --> 22:16.001
-It's boho, and it's age appropriate.
-Yeah.

22:16.418 --> 22:19.713
We've gotta get back
into the unfortunate clothes.

22:19.796 --> 22:21.256
[both laughing]

22:21.882 --> 22:23.717
[pop music playing]

22:27.387 --> 22:31.183
[Karamo] I've been researching
Burning Man culture, I want to understand

22:31.266 --> 22:33.977
why you're so intrigued by it.

22:34.061 --> 22:36.813
The spirituality is one
of the key things.

22:36.938 --> 22:39.858
There's a temple where people take photos,

22:39.941 --> 22:43.570
mementos of loved ones
that they've lost in the year

22:43.653 --> 22:45.530
and post those up everywhere.

22:45.614 --> 22:47.908
-At the end, they burn it.
-Powerful.

22:47.991 --> 22:49.159
It's very powerful.

22:49.242 --> 22:51.328
It's also a good place to let go.

22:51.411 --> 22:54.414
The temple is the one time
of year I give myself...

22:55.123 --> 22:57.209
-Let her rip. Get it all out.
-Yeah.

22:57.793 --> 22:58.752
[Karamo] Side note.

22:58.835 --> 23:02.798
I met with your friends because I
need to know more about you.

23:02.881 --> 23:07.094
And your friends,
they think you're afraid of success.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.304
-Probably.
-Why?

23:09.805 --> 23:12.099
I think I could use a little more ego.

23:12.182 --> 23:15.227
Your friends were on the nose
with what they were feeling about you.

23:15.310 --> 23:17.229
We spent a lot of time together.

23:17.813 --> 23:21.108
[Karamo] The fact you're afraid to succeed
is a problem.

23:21.191 --> 23:25.278
But we're gonna help you to see
if you do fail, it's okay.

23:25.362 --> 23:28.115
But you also might very well
just succeed.

23:28.198 --> 23:29.658
[Jason laughs] I dig that.

23:29.741 --> 23:31.952
There's a lot of this at Burning Man.

23:32.035 --> 23:33.286
-[Karamo] Really?
-Oh, yeah.

23:33.703 --> 23:34.788
It's mind-blowing.

23:34.871 --> 23:36.456
-Hi, are you Kimberly?
-Hi.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.125
-Karamo.
-Nice to meet you.

23:38.208 --> 23:40.627
-Jason.
-Nice to meet you.

23:40.710 --> 23:43.171
[Karamo] We have never done aerial arts--

23:43.255 --> 23:45.715
-This is blowing my mind. [laughs]
-I know, right?

23:45.966 --> 23:48.927
-You're gonna do just fine.
-Please be gentle.

23:49.010 --> 23:51.346
-Absolutely not.
-Yes, mama, yeah!

23:51.888 --> 23:53.974
[Jason] That does not look like
day one stuff.

23:54.057 --> 23:56.893
-[Karamo] All right, ready to stretch?
-[Jason] Sure.

23:57.686 --> 24:00.188
My granny used to say

24:00.272 --> 24:02.941
failure isn't the opposite
of success. It's part of it.

24:03.024 --> 24:06.111
Yeah, I agree with that,
and I am afraid of failure.

24:06.194 --> 24:08.488
You have to put yourself out there,

24:08.572 --> 24:11.324
and I think that requires
a little bit of ego.

24:11.408 --> 24:12.742
I haven't failed much.

24:12.826 --> 24:15.287
'Cause I haven't tried much.

24:15.370 --> 24:19.666
It's a fine line where ego gets blown out,
and you're self-centered.

24:19.875 --> 24:22.294
How do you think
it's affecting your life?

24:22.669 --> 24:26.631
Um, I'm sure it probably holds me back
from "career" things.

24:27.048 --> 24:29.551
The thing Jason
is struggling with the most

24:29.634 --> 24:33.680
is that I don't think he's ready
to face whatever fears he truly has.

24:33.763 --> 24:36.266
This is what's gonna help him
propel to that next level

24:36.349 --> 24:39.311
and get over that hump
of being afraid to succeed.

24:39.394 --> 24:41.479
This is about conquering fear.

24:41.563 --> 24:43.231
-Absolutely.
-Jump up for me.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.608
Knees on the outside.

24:44.691 --> 24:46.651
Slide your hands back and good.

24:46.735 --> 24:49.070
-[Karamo] Good job.
-That's nice.

24:49.696 --> 24:50.739
[all laughing]

24:51.489 --> 24:53.491
We're going to learn how to climb.

24:53.700 --> 24:56.161
Straighten this leg and stand on this.

24:56.703 --> 24:59.247
Yes, there you go.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.832
Jesus, I'm sweating.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.125
I keep slipping.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.543
That's normal.

25:03.627 --> 25:06.338
-That's normal. Yes.
-You gotta push harder with your feet.

25:06.421 --> 25:08.215
[Karamo] I'm gonna use that
against you.

25:08.298 --> 25:10.592
When you feel you're slipping,
push harder.

25:10.675 --> 25:13.053
-I like that.
-[Kimberly] Now, lift those knees.

25:13.136 --> 25:14.679
You're gonna bend them.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.389
-[Jason] Grab up.
-[Kimberly] Uh-huh.

25:16.473 --> 25:17.891
-There you go.
-[Karamo] Got it.

25:17.974 --> 25:20.435
Walk those hands up,
all the way up.

25:20.518 --> 25:22.938
-Yes.
-[Karamo] Good job. How do you feel?

25:23.021 --> 25:24.940
-High.
-[all laughing]

25:25.523 --> 25:27.234
Very good. Aw...

25:27.317 --> 25:29.653
-Look who's here to catch you.
-[Karamo] I was here.

25:29.736 --> 25:32.364
-I'm proud of you. That was good.
-Very nice.

25:32.447 --> 25:36.701
Jason is succeeding at every one of these
things she's telling him to do.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.954
-You are killing it.
-Thank you.

25:39.037 --> 25:41.831
This is the first taste of success
Jason needed.

25:41.915 --> 25:43.917
What I love is it's giving you

25:44.000 --> 25:46.253
-an experience to try something new.
-I'm excited.

25:46.336 --> 25:49.047
I will be fearless at Burning Man
when I come across one.

25:49.130 --> 25:50.090
Yes.

25:50.173 --> 25:52.801
-Hopefully this opens you up.
-I can get into this.

25:52.884 --> 25:55.136
-Not too shabby.
-You're getting over fears.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.846
-Not too shabby.
-You're swinging.

26:08.775 --> 26:10.860
Nice to have a Burning Man section.

26:10.944 --> 26:13.738
[Bobby] I wanna set Jason's home up
with great furniture

26:13.822 --> 26:15.365
that he can take to Reno

26:15.448 --> 26:18.535
so he can see what a home
should be when he moves.

26:20.078 --> 26:21.621
Excited to view the house?

26:21.705 --> 26:24.040
Yeah, definitely.

26:38.388 --> 26:41.016
-[Jason] Is this my house?
-[Bobby] You had amazing pieces.

26:41.099 --> 26:45.020
-They just needed to be showcased.
-This is really, really,

26:45.103 --> 26:46.563
really ridiculous.

26:46.646 --> 26:49.983
And look,
you have a whole handyman hideout.

26:50.525 --> 26:53.361
I didn't have a place for that.

26:53.445 --> 26:56.406
I wanted to give you things
you can take to Reno.

26:56.489 --> 26:57.574
[Jason] Thank you.

26:57.699 --> 27:01.161
-Are you ready for the rest?
-I doubt it. [laughing]

27:01.244 --> 27:02.620

-Holy crap.
-Shades, curtains.

in here, you already owned.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.713
There's your dining table.

27:11.796 --> 27:13.757
[Jason] Oh, my God, look at this table.

27:14.174 --> 27:17.385
The cool thing about these chairs,
they can go to Burning Man.

27:23.516 --> 27:24.893
Now you don't wanna leave?

27:24.976 --> 27:27.896
Is that what this was all about?
Get me to stay. Ah.

27:28.229 --> 27:29.564
-Clever.
-Beth called.

27:29.647 --> 27:32.484
She's like, "Make an amazing space,
so he doesn't leave."

27:32.567 --> 27:35.779
There may be regrets
going through Jason's mind.

27:35.862 --> 27:39.282
Realizing he could have been living
like this.

27:39.449 --> 27:42.035
You were in my head
when you set this up.

27:42.118 --> 27:43.787
-Yeah, yeah.
-Holy crap.

27:44.371 --> 27:47.374
-I like the use of the trunks.
-Which were clutter.

You have a pretty texture.
But it needs a bit of work.

that I'm gonna have
to come over here.

28:38.675 --> 28:42.262
So, I took clothes
to just do a shower at the Neon Company.

28:42.345 --> 28:47.100
I washed my hair with dish soap 'cause
that's all there was.

28:47.183 --> 28:48.101
Great.

28:48.685 --> 28:51.146
That's okay because I have
much more gorgeous shampoo

29:44.449 --> 29:45.992
Oh, the suspense.

29:46.159 --> 29:47.452
All right. Go and pop on up.

29:47.786 --> 29:48.620
[sighs]

29:50.038 --> 29:51.623
Hey, what--? Whoa.

29:51.915 --> 29:54.918
-[laughs] I remember that guy.
-You do?

29:55.001 --> 29:57.420
I remember that guy.
Holy cow.

29:57.629 --> 30:00.048
-What do you think?
-Amazing. Thank you.

30:00.131 --> 30:02.091
-I love how that's sitting,
-Uh-huh.

30:02.175 --> 30:04.219
-so that defines it a little.
-Awesome.

30:04.302 --> 30:05.345
-Tannie.
-Are we ready?

30:05.428 --> 30:07.388
-Yeah.
-Look how good you look.

30:07.722 --> 30:10.391
Oh, my gosh.
That's taken a decade off you.

30:10.475 --> 30:12.143
-[Jason] I think so.
-Am I right?

30:12.227 --> 30:13.561
Yes, how do you feel?

30:13.645 --> 30:16.064
-Wonderful. Yes.
-[Tan] You look so much better.

30:16.147 --> 30:18.608
-Can I steal?
-Get him in a gorgeous outfit.

30:18.691 --> 30:21.361
It makes no sense to leave you
in the clothes you've got on

30:21.444 --> 30:23.404
-because you've had a haircut.
-Right, yeah.

30:23.488 --> 30:26.825
My issue with a lot of your clothes
is that it's too big for your body.

30:26.908 --> 30:29.494
I wanna make sure
we're framing it the best way we can.

30:29.577 --> 30:30.745
So, get out of that top.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.455
-You mind--?
-You hate this?

30:32.539 --> 30:36.084
I do. I just wanna show you
the difference.

30:36.292 --> 30:38.002
Okay, good, good, good.

30:38.086 --> 30:40.463
The shoulders fit your shoulders.

30:40.547 --> 30:41.840
-Yeah.
-I don't have a shirt

30:41.923 --> 30:44.884
-that fits right, I know that.
-See what a difference that makes?

30:44.968 --> 30:47.053
-It fits you appropriately.
-I do.

30:47.136 --> 30:51.474
You seem to resonate with the boho style,
so we do earthy tones.

30:51.558 --> 30:54.477
I wanna mention one more thing.
I told you about this shirt.

30:54.561 --> 30:56.312
This was the one thing
that I thought:

30:56.396 --> 30:58.314
Okay, now, I understand his style.

30:58.398 --> 31:00.275
So, had it tailored
'cause it was a big.

31:00.358 --> 31:02.652
-Thank you.
-But, um, I'm gonna show you

31:02.735 --> 31:04.571
-how to wear this the right way.
-Sure.

31:04.654 --> 31:06.823
I got a whiff of something,
I thought it was me.

31:06.906 --> 31:08.950
-Your breath stinks?
-[Antoni] I had peanuts.

31:09.033 --> 31:10.285
It's probably me.

31:10.368 --> 31:12.495
It's not you. Fart-y baby.

31:12.579 --> 31:14.998
-I'm a fart-y baby.
-All right, boys.

31:15.081 --> 31:16.916
-Oh, my God.
-Gosh.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.960
-You have a face.
-Look how young you look.

31:19.043 --> 31:21.087
-And a nice one.
-You look amazing.

31:21.170 --> 31:22.130
[laughing]

31:22.213 --> 31:24.173
-Look at the buttons.
-I know.

31:24.257 --> 31:26.384
I love that he's smashed
his fresh hair

31:26.467 --> 31:28.553
-with a firm hat. It looks great.
-I'm sorry.

31:28.636 --> 31:30.847
-What does it look like without the hat?
-Lovely.

31:30.930 --> 31:32.307
Have you seen this hair?

31:32.390 --> 31:34.893
-Love it.
-What I love about this--

31:34.976 --> 31:37.896
-The moccasins.
-It's my hat and my shirt.

31:37.979 --> 31:39.981
-I was gonna say I've seen this.
-Serious?

31:40.064 --> 31:42.150
Yeah. I'm not devoid of style.

31:42.233 --> 31:45.653
I actually built the whole wardrobe
around this one shirt.

31:45.737 --> 31:48.531
This is all him. We've just shown him
how to wear it correctly.

31:48.615 --> 31:51.117
-[Jonathan] Love it.
-Never worn a skinny jean before.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.536
-[Jonathan] Is this a skinny?
-Skinny for him.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.079
[Bobby] That's a skinny jean.

31:55.163 --> 31:57.582
I don't wanna get him back
in those hideous clothes.

31:57.665 --> 31:59.667
So, we've given him something
he can cook in.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.044
-You ready?
-[Jason] Awesome.

32:01.127 --> 32:02.837
All right. Bye, boys, let's go.

32:03.338 --> 32:06.674
So, I wanted you to have
little lessons that you can take

32:06.758 --> 32:11.471
to your new and existing friends in Reno
and also the deserts of Burning Man.

32:11.554 --> 32:13.765
-Awesome.
-I was inspired by Beth.

32:13.848 --> 32:16.142
She got really emotional
about you leaving.

32:16.225 --> 32:19.145
-Oh, no.
-And I was thinking about my best friend,

32:19.228 --> 32:22.231
Rema, she has an amazing snack
that her mom taught her how to make.

32:22.315 --> 32:24.442
I actually call this Rema's Nuts.

32:24.525 --> 32:26.903
-But some people call it peanuts masala.
-All right.

32:26.986 --> 32:28.905
So, you start out with roasted peanuts.

32:28.988 --> 32:32.742
I heat these up on a pan just to release
the oils and get them nice and brown.

32:32.825 --> 32:34.035
Here we have red onion.

32:34.118 --> 32:37.747
-Once I cut it, I soak it in water.
-Never heard of that.

32:37.830 --> 32:40.917
It's gonna make the flavor a little
more mild but it still has bite.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.377
-Cilantro.
-Right.

32:42.460 --> 32:43.753
A nice little heap of that.

32:43.836 --> 32:46.339
So, I like to buy
unsalted roasted peanuts,

32:46.422 --> 32:48.758
so you can control
how much sodium goes in there.

32:48.841 --> 32:52.053
This is cayenne. We're gonna
be super modest and careful with this.

32:52.136 --> 32:54.389
-Sure.
-You can't take away any spice

32:54.472 --> 32:56.474
once you put too much, but you can
add more.

32:56.557 --> 33:00.103
So, it's better to make it gradual
and mix it around until you get it right.

33:00.186 --> 33:02.689
And then, finally, lime juice for acidity.

33:03.064 --> 33:06.067
That's basically it, and the only way
to find out is to taste it.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.696
-I like that.
-It's a crowd pleaser.

33:09.779 --> 33:12.699
This is something you can make
for friends, take to Burning Man.

33:12.782 --> 33:16.285
Your friends will be more impressed
than your standard peanut butter offerings

33:16.369 --> 33:19.288
-when they come and see you.
-They would absolutely be impressed.

33:19.539 --> 33:21.541
[Karamo] So, how's this week been for you?

33:21.624 --> 33:22.875
A whirlwind for sure.

33:22.959 --> 33:27.255
I think I have exactly the little bit
of a kick in the pants that I needed.

33:27.338 --> 33:28.923
Examine myself a little differently

33:29.007 --> 33:30.842
and take more care
about what I'm doing.

33:30.925 --> 33:34.345
We talked about Burning Man
and the traditions and culture.

33:34.429 --> 33:35.680
I was fascinated.

33:35.763 --> 33:39.642
It's a great place to, um, let go
of a lot of things,

33:39.726 --> 33:41.227
whatever you need to let go of.

33:41.310 --> 33:43.688
Well, that's what I love most
about Burning Man.

33:43.771 --> 33:45.481
-I got you these cards.
-Oh.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.901
I really want you to take an opportunity
before you go to your party

33:49.068 --> 33:51.946
to write down some of the things
we discussed.

33:52.030 --> 33:55.408
And in true tradition of Burning Man,
let them go.

33:55.491 --> 33:56.909
Well, I can absolutely do that.

33:56.993 --> 34:00.163
What are some of the things
that you feel that you'd be writing down?

34:00.246 --> 34:04.250
A little bit of a fear of intimacy,
fear of failure and fear of success.

34:04.333 --> 34:06.377
And, uh, the rest I'm gonna figure out.

34:06.961 --> 34:08.838
I don't want you to move to Reno

34:08.921 --> 34:12.341
having any of those feelings
and those issues with you.

34:12.425 --> 34:15.136
So, I'm excited about you
using those tonight.

34:15.219 --> 34:16.387
Definitely, definitely.

34:16.471 --> 34:19.098
I wanna talk about your party,
but I want the guys here.

34:19.182 --> 34:20.933
-Oh, right on.
-Hey, fellas!

34:21.517 --> 34:23.936
-Girl, you look amazing.
-Thank you.

34:24.020 --> 34:25.188
Yes.

34:25.271 --> 34:27.440
I'm so happy
about your going-away party.

34:27.523 --> 34:28.357
Me, too.

34:28.441 --> 34:31.194
[Karamo] Allow tonight
with the silent auction items

34:31.277 --> 34:34.155
that you and Bobby put together
be the first step in your plan.

34:34.238 --> 34:36.157
Failure is not the opposite of success.

34:36.240 --> 34:37.742
-Right.
-[Karamo] It's part of it.

34:37.825 --> 34:40.912
I would like to say
thank you again for pushing that

34:40.995 --> 34:43.289
because I procrastinate on things,

34:43.372 --> 34:46.626
but half of the time when I
do them, I'm like, "Why did I wait?"

34:46.709 --> 34:49.504
Glad to have been a mama bird
to push you out of the nest.

34:49.712 --> 34:52.882
You were a painter, you were
the burner, there was no real Jason.

34:52.965 --> 34:55.134
Everything in that closet truly feels you

34:55.218 --> 34:57.261
and the person that you wanna
continue to be.

34:57.345 --> 34:59.680
You did a great job.
I do wanna thank you guys.

34:59.764 --> 35:03.726
You did an amazing job of getting
to read me a little bit,

35:03.810 --> 35:07.396
and I appreciate the fact that
you put that into what you were doing.

35:07.605 --> 35:10.024
As a matter of fact,
if you give me one second,

35:10.525 --> 35:12.735
-I'd like to run and get you something.
-Get out.

35:12.819 --> 35:13.861
-What?
-For us?

35:13.945 --> 35:15.655
I thought of this last night.

35:15.738 --> 35:17.907
-It just came to me.
-Oh, my God, what is it?

35:18.157 --> 35:20.868
I got T-shirts for everybody
to remember this experience.

35:20.952 --> 35:23.037
But I didn't just get T-shirts.

35:23.121 --> 35:29.127
I got original, one of a kind,
slightly paint smeared...

35:29.210 --> 35:32.004
-That's amazing.
-Plunging neckline.

35:32.088 --> 35:35.258
-I love a plunging neckline.
-I really, really enjoyed

35:35.341 --> 35:37.385
-this experience. Thank you.
-Bye.

35:37.468 --> 35:39.595
-I'll look you up at Burning Man.
-Please, do.

35:39.679 --> 35:41.722
Good luck tonight,
be fantastic, be confident.

35:41.806 --> 35:42.890
Thank you very much.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.142
Bye, guys.

35:46.477 --> 35:50.106
♪ We're gonna dance
Till the sun comes up ♪

35:50.982 --> 35:54.861
♪ Until everybody knows
This world is for us ♪

35:56.028 --> 35:59.073
So, this is sort of a roasted nut
dish to have when people come in

35:59.157 --> 36:02.160
-you eat with your hands.
-[Jonathan] Throw another. I'll catch it.

36:03.411 --> 36:05.580
Yeah!

36:05.663 --> 36:07.999
You guys, so, I bet
they're literally about to light

36:08.082 --> 36:10.376
-that massive burning thing on fire.
-The effigy.

36:10.459 --> 36:12.211
Shall we go retire

36:12.295 --> 36:13.504
-to the lounge?
-Yeah.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.758
-After you.
-[Bobby] Are we ready for this?

36:17.842 --> 36:19.093
Of course we are.

36:20.511 --> 36:23.806
-[Jonathan] Topless Jason Vogelsang.
-Don't let that skinny body fool you.

36:23.890 --> 36:28.186
That man is so strong, he climbed
things like you can't imagine.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.646
[Tan] Yes, I love that shirt on him.

36:30.855 --> 36:32.440
-[Antoni] Those are oysters.
-Yeah.

36:33.816 --> 36:35.526
I gotta find the socks I had earlier.

36:35.943 --> 36:39.530
-Why is he going through dirty laundry?
-He had loads of socks.

36:39.864 --> 36:42.617
Maybe he doesn't realize
the clothes are in the dresser now.

36:42.700 --> 36:45.036
It's like old habits die hard, honey.

36:45.119 --> 36:47.830
[Karamo] Burning Man culture
is all about starting anew,

36:47.914 --> 36:49.207
and with him doing the move,

36:49.290 --> 36:52.710
I gave him these so he could write
down things he wanted to let go.

36:52.793 --> 36:55.254
-If you got an issue, burn it.
-That's what he's doing?

36:55.338 --> 36:57.006
-He's gonna burn all this?
-Mm.

36:57.089 --> 36:59.425
You know what I do not have time for?
Fear.

36:59.508 --> 37:00.927
-At all.
-None.

37:02.553 --> 37:04.013
Don't burn your nuts.

37:04.096 --> 37:05.640
Dude. [laughs]

37:05.723 --> 37:08.184
-[Jonathan] Is that Beth?
-Oh, my God, it smells good.

37:08.267 --> 37:10.144
-What the hell?
-[Jason] Roasting peanuts.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.188
Oh, hi, honey.

37:12.271 --> 37:13.522
Oh, my God.

37:13.606 --> 37:15.024
-Look at you.
-Right?

37:15.942 --> 37:18.694
I don't know if you guys
just like caught the subtle,

37:18.778 --> 37:20.738
not-subtle body language
Beth just gave him.

37:20.821 --> 37:22.114
-Yeah.
-Oh, yeah.

37:22.698 --> 37:25.076
-Oh, my God.
-[Jason] I know.

37:25.243 --> 37:28.287
-I actually wanna hang out here now.
-[Jason] I know.

37:29.121 --> 37:31.040
I got some swanky shoes.

37:31.332 --> 37:32.708
She just checked out his butt!

37:33.292 --> 37:35.544
-[Beth] Hey, Jason, what's this?
-Squash.

37:35.628 --> 37:37.755
-So, can I have all of this?
-No.

37:38.506 --> 37:40.883
How about you come over
and we cook together?

37:40.967 --> 37:43.552
[Antoni]
Look at her looking at him, making food.

37:43.636 --> 37:45.179
-The friend zone is over.
-Yeah.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.723
It is something you're supposed
to eat with your hands.

37:47.807 --> 37:50.309
-Gosh, that's super good.
-This is awesome.

37:50.393 --> 37:52.728
I should have taught him breakfast.

37:53.145 --> 37:56.357
[Beth] You've done things this week

37:56.440 --> 37:59.318
that literally we would have
to tranq you up to do.

37:59.902 --> 38:03.572
I guess I'm just wondering, like, if that
whole experience has sort of made you

38:03.656 --> 38:06.659
look at, you know, what you could do
in Atlanta differently

38:06.742 --> 38:09.453
versus skipping town and trying
in a new place.

38:09.537 --> 38:12.665
Certainly.
But Atlanta is just too big.

38:12.748 --> 38:13.749
It's a nightmare.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.376
Oh, traffic.

38:15.543 --> 38:18.170
-Beth and Michael, yay.
-[Jason] Right.

38:19.005 --> 38:21.382
You talking about
things that are not important.

38:21.465 --> 38:23.926
What about people who love you
and are in your life?

38:24.510 --> 38:25.386
I understand that.

38:26.095 --> 38:27.054
Aw...

38:28.347 --> 38:29.765
[laughing]

38:32.059 --> 38:33.644
-Here we go.
-You're making me sad.

38:33.728 --> 38:35.062
-Oh, come on.
-Don't be sad.

38:35.604 --> 38:37.148
And then, a selfie with me in it.

38:38.190 --> 38:40.109
-You've ruined it now.
-Get out of there!

38:40.192 --> 38:42.778
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

38:42.862 --> 38:44.447
[chattering]

38:46.157 --> 38:48.326
Not everybody knew
there was a silent auction.

I'm, like, turned on by those shoes, dude.

39:16.228 --> 39:18.064
[Fab 5] Oh, yes.

39:18.147 --> 39:20.441
-[Tan] They are good shoes.
-We have foot fetishes.

39:20.983 --> 39:22.318
[Beth] Is that a spittoon?

39:22.401 --> 39:25.738
That is a spittoon, and somebody wants
to pay $100 for it.

Oh, there's some money to be made here.

39:28.449 --> 39:31.619
[Jason] I've had the vision for a while
of doing hub caps with neon.

39:31.702 --> 39:33.662
The big awesome piece is back there.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.539
[Beth] Cool.

39:36.624 --> 39:39.418
[Bobby] Do you remember that old speaker
that was in?

39:39.502 --> 39:41.879
We turned it into an amp
with neon on it, painted it.

39:41.962 --> 39:42.797
Does it work?

39:43.547 --> 39:44.507
Does it work?

39:45.091 --> 39:46.592
Yes!

39:55.226 --> 39:57.019
All right, let's do this.

[Jason] The hub cap highlighted with neon

to Clayton and Catherine for $100.

40:08.823 --> 40:10.157
Oh, yeah.

40:10.699 --> 40:14.370
-Next, a speaker cabinet amp.
-Yeah!

This will be used in my wedding.

-[Karamo] Yes, come through fire.
-[Tan] We have Burning Man stuff.

40:33.889 --> 40:37.184
-This is why I wouldn't go to Burning Man.
-The dust, the sand, the heat.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.602
-[Tan] Yeah.
-[Karamo] I'd go.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.479
-You?
-[Jonathan] You won't put yourself

40:40.563 --> 40:42.606

[Michael] Jason, I fully support you
going to Reno,

40:47.486 --> 40:49.947
-but it makes me sad.
-Makes me sad, too.

40:50.030 --> 40:52.324
It's funny how quickly
I can get emotional about it

40:52.408 --> 40:54.660
because you are a beautiful man
and I love you.

40:54.743 --> 40:55.995
You're one of my constants.

40:56.078 --> 40:58.164
-I hope I have been that for you.
-Absolutely.

40:58.247 --> 41:01.208
And you have always been there, 30 years.

41:02.251 --> 41:04.712
It doesn't matter
where you go or what you do.

41:05.504 --> 41:09.508
You're a piece of my heart.
And that's all I can say without crying.

41:09.592 --> 41:11.510
-[Jason] Okay.
-I don't want you to go.

41:11.927 --> 41:13.804
-But I love you.
-I love you.

"Give me my flowers now, not later."

41:21.896 --> 41:23.522
So many times people forget

41:23.606 --> 41:26.275
to tell the people they are around
how much they love them.

41:26.358 --> 41:28.569
So, you know what?
I love you. I love you.

41:28.652 --> 41:30.279
I love you, and I love you.

41:30.362 --> 41:32.907
-I love you, girl.
-Aw.

41:33.240 --> 41:36.160
There were some things
that I kind of need to let go of

41:36.243 --> 41:38.078
that I've been living with too long.

41:38.162 --> 41:42.082
So, in true Burning Man fashion,
burn them and let them go.

-I love you.
-I love you, too.

41:54.178 --> 41:56.180
I guess it's something
that I innately know,

41:56.263 --> 42:01.352
but to hear it and to see everyone
gathering here is just a bit overwhelming.

42:01.936 --> 42:07.483
It's gonna be very hard to move on
to Reno and leave this behind.
