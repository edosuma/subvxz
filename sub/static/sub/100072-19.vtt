Ah, son of a bitch!

00:57.474 --> 00:58.516
I'm browning out.

00:58.517 --> 01:00.434

01:02.771 --> 01:05.230
<i>We interrupt this program

01:05.232 --> 01:08.317
<i>Record rains continue

01:17.327 --> 01:20.413
- Oh, my God.
- What are we gonna do now?

01:20.414 --> 01:22.415
Ah, well, at least we're all here,

01:22.416 --> 01:23.833
and we're all safe.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.668
- Where's Brian?
- Oh, my God.

01:25.669 --> 01:28.170
When we evacuated,
I think we forgot him.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.672
It's okay, Lois, I left him chained up

01:29.673 --> 01:31.299
in the gully in the backyard.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.802
Guys? Guys?

01:36.346 --> 01:38.639
All right, well, TV's out, no Internet.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.266
Let's all just go to the bathroom

01:40.267 --> 01:43.352
and pretend we can't hear each other go.

01:45.564 --> 01:47.148
So, Chris, did you get back

01:47.149 --> 01:49.400
your Industrial Revolution term paper?

01:49.401 --> 01:51.611
I did. I got an 11.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.571
Is-is that good?

01:53.572 --> 01:55.197
No, it's quite bad.

01:55.198 --> 01:58.034
Hey, guys, the splatter
on the floor was already here.

01:58.035 --> 02:00.911
I used four of the five towels
to clean it up.

02:00.912 --> 02:03.080
Seriously, guys, what are we
gonna do in here?

02:03.081 --> 02:04.707
Well, maybe there's something
in this drawer

02:04.708 --> 02:05.791
we can all play with.

02:05.792 --> 02:08.044
Hair gel, condom.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.461
Boy, the last guy who stayed here

02:09.463 --> 02:10.838
was super cool.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.465
And there's a book in here
that makes you tired

02:12.466 --> 02:13.799
just by looking at it.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.219
A book called "T,"
written by Holly Bibble.

02:17.220 --> 02:20.139
"Uh, Peter, I think that's
the Holy Bible..."

02:20.140 --> 02:23.684
Is what Brian would say if he
wasn't drowning in our backyard.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.227
When he's gone, can we get a bird?

02:25.228 --> 02:27.229
Read some, Peter, you'll love it.

02:27.230 --> 02:28.981
It's <i>Harry Potter</i> for stupid people.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.483
Hey, guys, could you tone it down?

02:30.484 --> 02:32.401
This is offensive
to the open-button shirt

02:32.402 --> 02:33.778
necklace community.

02:33.779 --> 02:37.281
Okay "The Street James Bibble." Page I.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.075
Seriously, could somebody else
read this?

02:39.076 --> 02:42.828
"In the beginning, God created
the Heaven and the Earth,

02:42.829 --> 02:46.165
and the sitcom joke that goes,
'That went well.'"

02:58.470 --> 03:02.973
<i>"And the first man and woman,
Adam and Eve."</i>

03:02.974 --> 03:06.602
I think the leaf over my balls
is poison ivy.

03:06.603 --> 03:07.937
What should we do today?

03:07.938 --> 03:09.313
I don't know,
but you're looking pretty hot.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.232
You should wear this to work more often.

03:11.233 --> 03:13.067
Hey, that's sexual harassment.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.656
Oh, so, should I stop?

03:14.657 --> 03:16.987
Yes, in about 10,000 years.

03:16.988 --> 03:19.949
Hey, while I got you,
there's nothing to do down here.

03:19.950 --> 03:22.743
When are you gonna invent
the American <i>Office</i> on Netflix?

03:22.744 --> 03:24.704
I-I just feel like they're not grateful.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.581
You know, I-I gave them water, the sun,

03:27.582 --> 03:30.000
a clear road map to hating gays.

03:30.001 --> 03:32.294
So, uh, you want to name more stuff?

03:32.295 --> 03:34.255
Ugh, that's all we ever do.

03:34.256 --> 03:37.007
Yeah, and there's still six
billion things left to name.

03:37.008 --> 03:39.301
Okay, I'll start.
That green, leafy thing.

03:39.302 --> 03:40.719
That's a Casey.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.597
That thing flying
through the sky there... Casey.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.725
You can't name everything Casey.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.101
All right, fine, Eve.

03:47.102 --> 03:49.145
What's the word for that thing
flying through the sky?

03:49.146 --> 03:51.411
- I don't know... bird.
- Oh, bird?

03:51.412 --> 03:53.001
- Bird is the word?
- Bird?

03:53.002 --> 03:54.220
- Bird.
- Bird?

03:54.221 --> 03:55.860
Bird. Bird is the word.

03:55.861 --> 03:57.069
Peter, cut it out!

03:57.070 --> 03:59.280
You know, charades are
a thing people do.

03:59.281 --> 04:03.159
Anyone mind if I open
fragrant Doritos in a tiny room?

04:03.160 --> 04:05.244
Ooh... Oh! Ugh...

04:05.245 --> 04:08.205
It smells like horse crap.
What flavor is it?

04:08.206 --> 04:10.249
"Cattle Ranch Doritos."

04:10.250 --> 04:13.002
Relax, Lois. <i>Family Guy</i>
has long been sponsored

04:13.003 --> 04:14.587
by Axe body spray.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.047
Axe?

04:17.048 --> 04:20.968
There. Now we all smell like
a nightmare Tinder date.

04:22.012 --> 04:24.221
Okay, you two, I'm going away
for the weekend.

04:24.222 --> 04:26.265
My girlfriend got a piece
in an art show,

04:26.266 --> 04:28.267
and I'd look like a dick if I didn't go.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.269
It's a pot that no one's allowed to use.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.313
Don't even suggest putting keys in it.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.815
Did everyone who submitted
to the art show get in?

04:34.816 --> 04:36.901
Yes. But again, don't want to be a dick.

04:36.902 --> 04:38.486
So, if you're looking
for me this weekend,

04:38.487 --> 04:40.571
I'll be nibbling terrible cheese cubes

04:40.572 --> 04:42.156
with Santa Fe people who couldn't cut it

04:42.157 --> 04:43.199
in the real world.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.575
Are any of them named Melody?

04:44.576 --> 04:45.785
They're <i>all</i> named Melody!

04:45.786 --> 04:47.536
Coming.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.872
Well, I gotta go get yelled at
for being late to something

04:49.873 --> 04:51.499
I didn't want to go to
in the first place.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.709
All right, before I go, I got two rules.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.628
No putting your penis
in the gopher holes,

04:55.629 --> 04:57.838
and no apples.

04:57.839 --> 05:01.008
You can trust us. Ow! That went well.

05:01.009 --> 05:04.220
Oh, my God, that's so funny.

05:04.221 --> 05:06.597
'Cause it didn't go well.

05:09.518 --> 05:11.519
- Adam, would you like a pear?
- Apple.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.686
- Orange?
- Apple.

05:12.687 --> 05:13.687
- Grape?
- Apple.

05:13.688 --> 05:14.688
- Peach?
- Apple.

05:14.689 --> 05:15.731
- Nectarine?
- Casey.

05:15.732 --> 05:16.732
- Cantaloupe?
- Apple.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.234
- Honeydew?
- Apple.

05:18.235 --> 05:19.276
- Clementine?
- Apple.

05:19.277 --> 05:21.028
Hey, you guys looking for some apples?

05:21.029 --> 05:22.780
You know, I <i>could</i> go for an apple.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.990
No. Adam, remember what God said.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.326
About his nightmare girlfriend's
art show?

05:27.327 --> 05:29.328
'Cause that's all I remember
about that poor guy.

05:29.329 --> 05:33.082
No. He said if we eat the apple
we're kicked out of paradise.

05:33.083 --> 05:36.418
- They have antioxidants.
- They do?

05:36.419 --> 05:38.462
Why would I lie? I'm a snake in a tree.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.339
I have nothing to gain
from lying to you,

05:40.340 --> 05:42.091
aside from the minor sexual thrill

05:42.092 --> 05:43.175
of watching someone eat something.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.343
And-and that's minor.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.095
Okay, I'm gonna do it.

05:46.096 --> 05:47.471
Okay, good. Now, Adam can't be here.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.682
Eat it with your feet, and
look at me when you do it.

05:55.146 --> 05:57.774
What the hell happened here?!

05:59.651 --> 06:01.819
Uh, it's not our fault.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.571
You created the most tempting thing

06:03.572 --> 06:06.073
man has ever known... a piece of fruit.

06:06.074 --> 06:09.326
That's it, you two are
kicked out of paradise.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.287
Unless you want to buy a nice pot.

06:11.288 --> 06:12.746
Can I put my keys in it?

06:12.747 --> 06:14.331
- No.
- Fine, we'll leave.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.000
But where will we live?

06:16.001 --> 06:17.877
The opposite of Eden.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.254
Well, Florida, time to fit in.

06:20.255 --> 06:22.715
Let's go have sex
with gum in our mouths.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.174
Then what happened?

06:24.175 --> 06:26.385
- They populated the Earth.
- How?

06:26.386 --> 06:29.221
- They had kids.
- Okay, but then, what did <i>they</i> do?

06:29.222 --> 06:30.389
They had kids, too.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.182
- With who?
- They were fruitful.

06:32.183 --> 06:34.184
- With who?
- Well, the girls

06:34.185 --> 06:36.186
with either their brothers
or their fathers,

06:36.187 --> 06:39.023
and the boys with either
their sisters or their mothers.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.441
That's disgusting.

06:40.442 --> 06:42.342
No, Meg, that's the Bible.

06:48.867 --> 06:51.243
Are we just gonna let
that guy in the parking lot

06:51.244 --> 06:52.536
keep screaming at his girlfriend?

06:52.537 --> 06:54.204
Peter, get away from the window.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.956
Shh, shh, shh. If we're quiet,

06:55.957 --> 06:57.499
you can hear every fifth word.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.793
Always......

06:59.794 --> 07:04.465
- never......
- my friends......

07:04.466 --> 07:06.091
Michelob Ultra!

07:06.092 --> 07:07.176
All right, back to the Bible.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.970
And again, you'll let me know
if another older,

07:09.971 --> 07:12.473
heavyset woman wanders by
in nothing but a T-shirt?

07:12.474 --> 07:14.516
Why did we choose this motel?

07:14.517 --> 07:15.893
This is any motel.

07:15.894 --> 07:18.520
Now, here's a story about
a bunch of animals

07:18.521 --> 07:19.856
who went on a cruise.

07:26.404 --> 07:31.033
Noah, I want you to build an ark.

07:31.034 --> 07:33.077
Right.

07:33.078 --> 07:35.204
- What's an ark?
- A large ship.

07:35.205 --> 07:38.207
40 cubits by 80 cubits by 40 cubits.

07:38.208 --> 07:41.710
Right. What's a cubit?

07:41.711 --> 07:44.380
Wait a minute, are you just
doing Bill Cosby bits?

07:44.381 --> 07:46.382
Yeah, why not? All of his stuff
is up for grabs.

07:46.383 --> 07:47.800
What is he gonna do, sue us?

07:47.801 --> 07:49.301
Now, where was I? Oh, yeah.

07:49.302 --> 07:53.097
"Noah was feeding his children
chocolate cake for breakfast."

07:53.098 --> 07:56.141
Dad is great. Give us chocolate cake.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.893
Dad is great.

07:57.894 --> 07:59.520
Give us chocolate cake.

07:59.521 --> 08:01.563
Terrific. Okay, kids, that's enough.

08:01.564 --> 08:04.149
We're done stealing from "Dr." Cosby.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.193
Now it's time to get ready for school.

08:06.194 --> 08:09.822
There's no school today.
There was another mass stoning.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.157
Ugh, another school stoning.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.742
When will we learn?

08:13.743 --> 08:15.411
If only those teachers had stones,

08:15.412 --> 08:16.662
then they could stone back.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.580
Hello? Stone control.

08:18.581 --> 08:21.750
Shem, stones don't kill people.
People kill people.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.085
With stones.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.586
I don't think the Founding Fathers

08:24.587 --> 08:26.922
ever envisioned stones this large.

08:26.923 --> 08:29.174
Can we not politicize the stoning?

08:29.175 --> 08:31.051
All right? Thoughts and prayers.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.679
Thoughts and prayers for the bashed.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.304
Oh, hey, honey, two things.

08:35.306 --> 08:36.974
I stopped taking my lithium,

08:36.975 --> 08:38.642
and I'm building an ark for God.

08:38.643 --> 08:41.352
- Those things seem related.
- They're not related.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.230
- They're fighting again.
- Shh.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.357
If you're quiet,
you can hear every fifth word.

08:46.901 --> 08:51.155
- Always......
- never......

08:51.156 --> 08:53.490
They're my animals......

08:53.491 --> 08:54.950
Michelob Ultra!

08:54.951 --> 08:57.786
<i>"To build the ark, Noah stole the wood</i>

08:57.787 --> 08:59.121
<i>from the front of his neighbor's house."</i>

08:59.122 --> 09:03.751
No, no, no, no, Noah!

09:03.752 --> 09:06.628
<i>"And the animals came, two by two,</i>

09:06.629 --> 09:08.797
<i>and were given poorly assigned rooms."</i>

09:08.798 --> 09:11.884
All right, uh, lions, you'll be
with the baby antelopes.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.970
Uh, crocodiles, you're with
the water-crossing wildebeests.

09:14.971 --> 09:17.139
Uh, bats, you'll be with bugs.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.141
Seagulls, McDonald's wrappers.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.893
Pit bulls and city babies.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.437
And Christian Bale and
annoying cameramen.

09:23.438 --> 09:26.440
Hey, Christian, looks like
I'm rooming with you.

09:26.441 --> 09:29.151
Oh, good for you!

09:31.571 --> 09:34.740
<i>"Soon, the Great Flood came...</i>

09:34.741 --> 09:36.325
<i>"...and the ark set sail.</i>

09:36.326 --> 09:38.327
<i>"Then, like every father on a boat,</i>

09:38.328 --> 09:41.038
<i>Noah quickly became
a total dick to his family."</i>

09:41.039 --> 09:42.664
Is that a half-hitch knot?

09:42.665 --> 09:44.625
Uh... yeah.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.460
Well, if it's a half-hitch,
it's not gonna hold.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.879
It's gotta be a reef knot.
You call yourself a sailor?

09:48.880 --> 09:51.632
- I don't know.
- Can I talk to you portside?

09:51.633 --> 09:54.384
Why are you heading starboard?
I said portside.

09:54.385 --> 09:56.220
I don't... I don't
understand what's happening.

09:56.221 --> 09:58.555
I really don't. Why...
Why would you go starboard

09:58.556 --> 09:59.890
if I said portside?

09:59.891 --> 10:01.058
Look, why don't I tie the knots,

10:01.059 --> 10:03.477
you polish the teak. Can you do that?

10:03.478 --> 10:06.230
Wait, you're gonna polish
the teak on the windward side?

10:06.231 --> 10:08.565
I ca... I can't...
Is this... Is this guy for real?

10:08.566 --> 10:09.817
It's gonna make a mess.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.401
You have to do it on the leeward side.

10:11.402 --> 10:13.695
- Sorry.
- Never mind. Just take a break.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.364
All right? I left
a <i>Penthouse</i> magazine for you

10:15.365 --> 10:16.448
in the aft cabin.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.867
Oh, suddenly he's Popeye.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.997
Okay, guys, now remember to use
the right bathrooms.

10:23.998 --> 10:26.000
All right, you're either
"pellets" or "piles."

10:27.710 --> 10:30.587
Excuse me, what about green smooshies?

10:30.588 --> 10:32.214
Oi, yeah, wombat here.

10:32.215 --> 10:34.216
What if my poop is a perfect cube?

10:34.217 --> 10:35.634
It's a real thing you can Google,

10:35.635 --> 10:36.969
it's really quite remarkable.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.223
Okay, God, we're doing it.

10:41.224 --> 10:42.975
Good. And you brought all the animals?

10:42.976 --> 10:44.226
- Yup.
- Lions?

10:44.227 --> 10:45.352
- Yup.
- Tigers?

10:45.353 --> 10:46.730
- Yup.
- Spiders?

10:46.731 --> 10:49.356
- Mm-hmm.
- W-Wait, w-why'd you say it like that?

10:49.357 --> 10:52.192
- Did you not bring spiders?
- I don't like spiders.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.778
And-and technically, they're not
animals, they're arachnids.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.405
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

10:56.406 --> 10:57.698
You know what I meant.

10:57.699 --> 10:59.456
Snakes?

10:59.457 --> 11:01.869
- Oh, come on!
- I-I got a lot of stuff!

11:01.870 --> 11:04.957
39 days later...

11:09.460 --> 11:11.670
I'm sorry I threw
the <i>Monopoly</i> board overboard

11:11.671 --> 11:13.172
on the third day.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.840
I was mad I couldn't be the hat.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.884
Well, at least we still have
<i>The Game of Life.</i>

11:16.885 --> 11:18.051
I'm the blue car.

11:18.052 --> 11:20.929
Um, I'm-- I'm already the blue car.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.433
Sorry I threw
<i>The Game of Life</i> overboard.

11:24.434 --> 11:27.144
All right, let's play <i>Risk</i>
until it's clear I can't win.

11:27.145 --> 11:30.731
Look! A bird on the horizon!

11:36.237 --> 11:38.488
Ah! Giant Bible bird!

11:38.489 --> 11:40.449
Aah!

11:40.450 --> 11:44.036
Somebody throw away the
balled-up underwear in my room!

11:44.037 --> 11:45.412
Don't look at it!

11:45.413 --> 11:47.122
Just throw it away!

11:47.123 --> 11:49.542
Ah, look! Land!

11:52.128 --> 11:54.504
Pale-Israel-stein.

11:54.505 --> 11:56.965
Now let's divide it into banks
and strips

11:56.966 --> 11:59.760
as one normally does with land.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.179
"Shem and Ham married their mom,

12:02.180 --> 12:04.848
"while she and Noah remained
the best of friends.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.975
"Noah even danced with Ham
at his second marriage

12:06.976 --> 12:08.518
"to his daughter.

12:08.519 --> 12:11.396
"Shem and Ham had twins
named Phlegm and Yam,

12:11.397 --> 12:13.357
"who married each other and gave birth

12:13.358 --> 12:15.025
to Noah's next daughter-wife."

12:15.026 --> 12:17.611
And that's the story of the Great Flood.

12:17.612 --> 12:20.239
Now God only brings natural disasters

12:20.240 --> 12:23.158
to places that have
too much butt stuff going on.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.957
<i>God, if you stop this rain,</i>

12:25.958 --> 12:28.413
<i>I promise I'll never do butt stuff.</i>

12:28.414 --> 12:30.832
<i>God, if you stop this rain,</i>

12:30.833 --> 12:32.961
<i>I'll never do butt stuff agai.</i>

12:34.170 --> 12:36.214
<i>Let it pour.</i>

12:42.220 --> 12:45.138
This is fun.
Read us something else, Dad.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.682
You got it, Chris.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.726
How about this laminated
motel information sheet?

12:49.727 --> 12:51.144
"Checkout is noon.

12:51.145 --> 12:53.897
"Must dial nine to reach
outside prostitute.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.315
"In the event of fire,

12:55.316 --> 12:58.151
"follow the older heavyset lady
in just a T-shirt.

12:58.152 --> 13:00.570
"There are no dining facilities on-site,

13:00.571 --> 13:03.282
"but guests are encouraged
to visit the Applebee's,

13:03.283 --> 13:06.076
which is a short walk across
the six-lane highway."

13:06.077 --> 13:07.911
Well, we might have to brave that walk.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.163
I'm starving.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.249
Oh, God, I made eye contact

13:12.250 --> 13:13.625
with someone looking for shelter.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.793
Guys?

13:14.794 --> 13:16.211
Guys?

13:16.212 --> 13:18.880
Lot of street signs
whipping around out here.

13:18.881 --> 13:21.091
I had an umbrella,
but as this is a comedy,

13:21.092 --> 13:23.218
you can imagine what happened to it.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.012
Let's see what's in the mini-fridge.

13:25.013 --> 13:28.682
There's nothing in here to eat
but crackers and screw-top wine.

13:28.683 --> 13:30.809
Who buys a comb out of a mini-fridge?

13:30.810 --> 13:33.061
- Guys?
- Crackers and wine?

13:33.062 --> 13:34.396
You know, that actually reminds me

13:34.397 --> 13:37.232
of another Bible story: The Last Supper.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.318
"It was the week before Easter,

13:39.319 --> 13:42.070
<i>"and Jesus and Mary Magdalene
were dyeing eggs</i>

13:42.071 --> 13:44.656
<i>"with that cheap messy coloring
kit from the drugstore</i>

13:44.657 --> 13:47.451
<i>"that has those weird paper
things that are like costumes</i>

13:47.452 --> 13:49.494
<i>for the eggs but never really
fit around the eggs..."</i>

13:49.495 --> 13:50.954
Hey. Hey, Mary.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.040
The half-orange, half-red one
is mine, so don't eat it.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.875
I wanna have it for when we watch

13:54.876 --> 13:56.335
<i>The Sound of Music</i> on Sunday.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.045
We don't have to wait till Sunday.

13:58.046 --> 13:59.588
We can eat these eggs tonight.

13:59.589 --> 14:02.257
Oh. Sorry, I got that big supper
with the guys tonight.

14:02.258 --> 14:04.301
But tomorrow's Friday, date night.

14:04.302 --> 14:06.261
You and me.
Nothing's keepin' me from that.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.555
Somebody'd have to nail me
to a piece of wood

14:08.556 --> 14:10.140
and throw me in a cave grave.

14:10.141 --> 14:12.100
You're having supper
with your disciples?

14:12.101 --> 14:13.935
What's the big occasion?

14:13.936 --> 14:16.772
Ah, we're drafting teams
for our fantasy football league.

14:16.773 --> 14:19.358
And if one guy isn't there, it
screws it all up for everybody.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.276
Like last time,
Paul was on his speaker phone,

14:21.277 --> 14:22.819
and we were like, "Paul, you're up,"

14:22.820 --> 14:24.196
and he'd be like, "I'm what?"

14:24.197 --> 14:25.197
And we'd say, "You're up."

14:25.198 --> 14:27.282
And he'd be like
"Oh, okay, um, Randy Moss."

14:27.283 --> 14:30.202
And we'd say, "Thomas picked
Randy Moss, he's off the board."

14:30.203 --> 14:32.871
And he'd say, "What?"
It just... it just really sucked.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.790
Well, I guess if your friends
are expecting you,

14:34.791 --> 14:36.124
- you have to go.
- Right?

14:36.125 --> 14:37.584
Okay, I'll see ya.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.127
Are you sure you don't want to change?

14:39.128 --> 14:41.755
That's the same robe you wore
to the leper colony.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.673
I don't know, maybe throw it
in the dryer at least?

14:43.674 --> 14:45.258
Don't take this the wrong way,

14:45.259 --> 14:48.470
but I'm not taking advice
about germs from a whore.

14:51.641 --> 14:54.434
Mr. Pilate, I'm here
to file a complaint.

14:54.435 --> 14:56.937
It's Passover, and somebody tricked me

14:56.938 --> 14:58.105
into eating leavened bread!

14:58.106 --> 14:59.856
Look, I'm from Rome.

14:59.857 --> 15:01.525
If it isn't spaghetti,
I don't know what the hell

15:01.526 --> 15:03.443
you're talking about.
Now get out of here!

15:03.444 --> 15:05.570
Grace! Grace, am I done?

15:05.571 --> 15:07.030
Can I go home?

15:07.031 --> 15:08.281
Ooh, not yet.

15:08.282 --> 15:11.201
You still have that meeting
with that Judas Iscariot

15:11.202 --> 15:13.161
regarding that Jesus fella.

15:13.162 --> 15:15.038
Ugh, right, Jesus.

15:15.039 --> 15:16.832
Man, that guy's a pain in the ass.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.000
Oh, well, he's very popular.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.044
The lepers, the Canaanites,
the fishermen,

15:21.045 --> 15:23.588
the Philippians, that woman at the well.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.132
Oh, they all love him.

15:25.133 --> 15:27.759
They think he's a righteous dude.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.177
Wasn't that cool?

15:29.178 --> 15:30.637
That was really her. Edie McClurg.

15:30.638 --> 15:31.763
Thanks, Edie.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.390
Hey, man, what's the buzz?

15:33.391 --> 15:35.016
Tell me what's a-happening.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.726
What are you, high?
What the hell is that?

15:36.727 --> 15:38.895
Listen, I got 30 pieces of silver

15:38.896 --> 15:40.439
if you narc on your friend Jesus.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.898
Oh, I don't know.

15:41.899 --> 15:43.525
Seems like kind of a slimy thing to do.

15:43.526 --> 15:46.153
I will also throw in
two dirty tennis balls.

15:46.154 --> 15:49.197
Well, lead with that, man! Yeah!

15:49.198 --> 15:52.367
Okay, we're all gonna be at
the Jerusalem El Torito at 5:15.

15:52.368 --> 15:53.618
5:15?

15:53.619 --> 15:55.120
Yeah, it's a very big group.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.289
It was either that or 10:45.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.086
Did it go off yet?

16:03.087 --> 16:04.421
No. Stop askin' me.

16:04.422 --> 16:05.922
I thought we had a reservation.

16:05.923 --> 16:08.717
So did I. So did I.

16:08.718 --> 16:12.220
I just went to the bathroom.
The whole patio's open.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.014
Yeah, but are there heating lamps?

16:14.015 --> 16:17.476
'Cause I can hear Simon already:
"Beep. Beep-boop.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.895
Beep-boop-beep. Ba..."

16:19.896 --> 16:21.104
We get it, it's cold.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.106
- "Christ"?
- Oh, yes, that's us.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.483
Ed Christ?

16:24.484 --> 16:26.151
Uh, no, no, Jesus Christ.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.611
I'm Ed Christ.

16:27.612 --> 16:29.571
Great. Is your whole party here?

16:29.572 --> 16:32.115
Almost, my wife Stephanie
is out pooping on some hay,

16:32.116 --> 16:33.950
but she is here.

16:33.951 --> 16:36.161
How's this?

16:36.162 --> 16:37.913
All right, that's great.

16:37.914 --> 16:40.123
Hey, guys, I want to have fun
with the seating.

16:40.124 --> 16:42.959
Let's do it boy, boy... boy, boy...

16:42.960 --> 16:45.128
boy, boy... boy, boy.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.547
And let's all sit on
the same side of the table.

16:47.548 --> 16:50.926
Can I start you folks off
with anything to drink?

16:50.927 --> 16:53.178
Yes, we'll all be splitting
one cup of wine.

16:53.179 --> 16:57.098
And can we have some bread
and no other food at all?

16:57.099 --> 16:59.100
Wow. Let me guess, you're Jewish?

16:59.101 --> 17:02.062
Yes, although my first name
is oddly Puerto Rican.

17:02.063 --> 17:04.231
Friends, followers,

17:04.232 --> 17:07.067
there's something important
we must discuss.

17:07.068 --> 17:09.861
Remember the Pizza Hut
Bigfoot Pizza from the '90s?

17:09.862 --> 17:11.613
That thing was huge.

17:11.614 --> 17:13.406
I mean, I-it was, like, this big.

17:18.621 --> 17:21.122
Your photos will be
available in the lobby

17:21.123 --> 17:22.415
when your meal is over.

17:22.415 --> 17:25.539
O-Okay, uh, thank you. Thank you.

17:25.540 --> 17:28.509
Sorry about that, I was kind of
right in the middle of my thing.

17:28.510 --> 17:30.799
Anyway, there's something else
you should know.

17:30.800 --> 17:34.428
Before the night is over,
one of you will betray me.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.267
This is some bullcrap.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.018
I'm the only one who's the color

17:42.019 --> 17:43.353
we're supposed to be in this thing.

17:43.354 --> 17:45.438
Yeah, let's not be so quick
to judge here.

17:45.439 --> 17:47.566
- We're better than tha...
- Quiet down, Judas.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.609
There's a Judas among us.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.194
And it's Luke!

17:51.195 --> 17:53.863
Oh, good, I thought I was too late.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.449
Wait... what... h-hey!

17:56.450 --> 17:58.827
- What are you doing?
- Kissing you, like in the plan.

17:58.828 --> 18:00.412
The old "Judas Kiss."

18:00.413 --> 18:02.247
No, it's Jesus who gets the kiss.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.999
And did you... did you close your eyes?

18:04.000 --> 18:06.084
Oh, so I kiss Jesus, then?

18:06.085 --> 18:08.086
- No, I do.
- Well, who do I kiss?

18:08.087 --> 18:10.463
All right, I'm not leaving here
until I kiss a guy.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.340
It's the only reason I joined the army.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.676
Okay, good, here's the bread.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.136
Now everybody listen up.

18:16.137 --> 18:18.096
Take this, and eat it.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.432
It's supposed to be, like, my body.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.184
- Ew, what part?
- I'm not gonna say what part,

18:23.185 --> 18:25.437
but you're supposed to eat it
while kneeling.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.689
All right, now it's a party.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.899
Okay, now pass this wine around.

18:29.900 --> 18:32.193
You're never gonna believe
what this is supposed to be.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.738
♪ <i>Happy, happy birthday,
from all of us to you</i> ♪

18:34.739 --> 18:37.657
♪ <i>We wish it was our birthday,</i>
<i>so we could party, too, hey!</i> ♪

18:37.658 --> 18:38.859
Ah, son of a bitch!

18:38.860 --> 18:40.035
All right, forget it. You know what?

18:40.036 --> 18:41.202
This whole thing is ruined.

18:41.203 --> 18:42.704
Okay? We'll just do it next week.

18:42.705 --> 18:44.331
I mean, it's not like this is
our last supper.

18:44.332 --> 18:45.832
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

18:45.833 --> 18:47.083
You're supposed to arrest this guy.

18:47.084 --> 18:49.002
Relax, man, it's a party.

18:49.003 --> 18:50.503
That's enough.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.589
All right, you're coming with me, buddy.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.090
Listen, pal, I forgive you,

18:54.091 --> 18:55.425
because you know not what you do,

18:55.426 --> 18:56.635
but get the hell out of here.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.887
I ain't leaving. You are.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.849
Oh, you think so?

19:08.064 --> 19:11.149
"It was a chicken fight
of biblical proportions.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.068
"And then, there was Easter.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.528
"Also, pregnant ladies
have to have the baby.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.739
The end of the Bible."

19:17.740 --> 19:19.240
- Hey!
- The lights are on!

19:19.241 --> 19:20.662
That vent is dripping again.

19:20.663 --> 19:22.577
And it looks like the storm has passed.

19:22.578 --> 19:23.995
Great, let's get out of here.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.997
Oh, it wasn't so bad, Meg.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.041
We got to spend time as a family,

19:28.042 --> 19:29.879
and read a few stories from the Bible.

19:29.880 --> 19:33.254
You're right. And look, somebody
bookmarked another page for us.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.256
Maybe there's one more story we can all

19:35.257 --> 19:37.300
learn an important lesson from...
oh, oh,

19:37.301 --> 19:38.799
it's a whole big toenail.

19:38.800 --> 19:41.429
Okay, all right, last one
across the highway

19:41.430 --> 19:43.932
to Applebee's has to pay.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.102
You gotta cross at the light!

19:47.103 --> 19:49.145
- Shut up!
- What did you say?!

19:49.146 --> 19:50.772
Oh, we doin' this?

19:50.773 --> 19:53.191
- We doin' this?!
- You're damn right we are!

19:53.192 --> 19:56.111
PETER: Watch out, I got God on my side,
I will (BLEEP) kill you!

20:10.501 --> 20:12.293
Well, it's good to be home.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.546
I'm glad our house
survived the hurricane.

20:14.547 --> 20:17.132
Yeah, now we got three months
of sour-smelling house

20:17.133 --> 20:19.134
to look forward to while it dries out.

20:19.135 --> 20:20.510
I was left to die.

20:20.511 --> 20:22.429
Chris, you kept the Bible?

20:22.430 --> 20:24.305
Yeah. I think I'm gonna get a job

20:24.306 --> 20:27.225
as a night security guard
and just read it constantly.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.686
I'm already putting lots
of notes in the margins.

20:29.687 --> 20:31.563
"And the king said unto her,

20:31.564 --> 20:34.149
"'What aileth thee?' And she answered,

20:34.150 --> 20:36.735
"'This woman said unto me, give thy son,

20:36.736 --> 20:40.989
"that we may eat him today, and
we will eat my son tomorrow.

20:40.990 --> 20:43.867
So we boiled my son, and did eat him.'"

20:43.868 --> 20:45.952
Second Kings 6:28-20.

20:45.953 --> 20:48.079
- But you already knew that.
- Look, man, I was just seeing

20:48.080 --> 20:50.874
if anyone dropped off my
umbrella at the lost and found.

20:50.875 --> 20:54.210
Well, let's see. There's got to
be something in here for that.

20:54.211 --> 20:55.754
Hey, you ever read <i>Dianetics?</i>

20:55.755 --> 20:57.714
No, but I believe it.

20:57.715 --> 21:00.968
And that is why I'm not gay.
