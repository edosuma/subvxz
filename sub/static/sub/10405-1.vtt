01:07.735 --> 01:09.235
(LAUGHING)

01:09.319 --> 01:14.824
I live in Austria's
coolest city, Vienna.
No big deal. Whatever.

01:16.160 --> 01:18.661
I am the host of Funkyzeit,

01:18.746 --> 01:23.833
the most important
TV fashion show in any
German-speaking country,

01:24.376 --> 01:25.877
apart from Germany.

01:30.716 --> 01:33.301
Funkyzeit is
über influential.

01:33.385 --> 01:39.223
In fact, Austrian fashionistas
live their lives according
to my "In or Out" list.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.642
In! Autism.

01:41.727 --> 01:42.977
Aus. Chlamydia.

01:44.146 --> 01:47.523
Why is autism
so cool at the moment?

01:47.649 --> 01:50.276
Because it's funny.
Great.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.780
BRÜNO: Through Funkyzeit,
ich have done interviews

01:53.864 --> 01:56.657
mit everyone in
the Euro-fashion world.

01:56.742 --> 01:58.951
Can you look into
this camera and just say,

01:59.036 --> 02:01.704
"You're watching
Funkyzeit mit Brüno"?

02:01.789 --> 02:06.709
You are watching Funkyzeit
program with Brüno,
and it's really a great show.

02:07.252 --> 02:10.545
Yeah, that's cool.
Can you do it, like, even more
like a kind of black guy?

02:10.631 --> 02:11.631
You know,
like an afrikanischer...

02:11.715 --> 02:13.132
Like this?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:13.217 --> 02:17.136
You are watching
Funkyzeit program
with Brüno.

02:17.221 --> 02:20.640
Yo, man. Fuck, man.
Welcome to the jungle.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.350
Something maybe
a bit more crazy.

02:22.434 --> 02:24.936
Maybe show a bit of skin
or something like that.

02:25.062 --> 02:28.981
No, I don't think so.
Or what about just
like one Kugelsack?

02:29.066 --> 02:30.525

02:30.943 --> 02:31.984
No.

02:32.528 --> 02:36.239
And the most exciting
and amazing thing
in the town,

02:36.323 --> 02:41.536
from the fashion streets
of Milan, only for the
German girls, my great hairs.

02:41.620 --> 02:42.912
Yo, man.

02:46.375 --> 02:48.751
Modeling, a lot of people
think it's easy.

02:48.836 --> 02:51.504
But it's the hardest job
in the world, isn't it?

02:51.588 --> 02:56.134
It's very hard.
Standing in heels all day,
and everyone's watching you,

02:56.218 --> 02:58.970
so you have to make sure
your walk is good. And, yeah.

02:59.054 --> 03:01.180
Yeah, it's really hard,
'cause you've gotta
remember, like,

03:01.265 --> 03:04.517
to put your right leg forward
and then put
your left leg forward

03:04.601 --> 03:06.310
and then, like,
which one now?

03:06.395 --> 03:08.771
Right leg again,
and then, like,
the left one.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.606
And then sometimes
you even have to turn.

03:10.691 --> 03:15.444
Yeah. And especially
the turn. It's so scary.

03:16.530 --> 03:21.159
BRÜNO: Being the host from
Funkyzeit means Brüno's always
seated on the front row.

03:22.494 --> 03:24.287
Hi. How are you?

03:24.371 --> 03:25.788
You have to lose
some weight.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.583
The kettle is calling
the pot black.
Oh, yeah?

03:30.210 --> 03:34.755
Put your shoulders back.
This is a fashion show,
not a slave auction.

03:37.092 --> 03:39.969
BRÜNO: Mein personal
assistant, Kookus,
is my rock.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.263
He's also mein stylist.

03:42.472 --> 03:45.308
Do you think the glasses
are too much?
Yeah, I'd lose them.

03:45.392 --> 03:46.726
They're too much like,
"Look at me.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.853
"Hey, everybody,
look at me.
Look at my glasses."

03:48.979 --> 03:50.605
Yeah.
"Everybody, like,
stare at my glasses."

03:50.689 --> 03:52.648
BRÜNO: He's also
my nutritionist.

03:53.108 --> 03:54.901
(RETCHING)
Yeah, that is good.

03:55.277 --> 03:59.280
BRÜNO: I have a second
assistant, but ich can't
remember its name.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.992
Brüno has known true love
twice in his life.

04:03.076 --> 04:07.121
Once, for seven minutes
with Milli from
Milli und Vanilli.

04:07.206 --> 04:08.247
No big deal. Whatever.

04:09.082 --> 04:13.669
But for the last nine years,
ich have been head über heels
in love

04:13.754 --> 04:17.005
mit a pygmy flight
attendant called Diesel.

04:17.632 --> 04:22.261

Just half a glass.
Otherwise I get too giggly.

05:02.511 --> 05:04.512
I left for Milan Fashion Week

05:04.596 --> 05:07.348
to shoot a new season
of Funkyzeit.

05:08.058 --> 05:13.229
Brüno had backstage access
for the hottest show
of the week, de la Prada.

05:13.647 --> 05:19.652
So I wore the jewel
of mein wardrobe, a suit
made entirely out of Velcro.

Wow.
Pretty cool, right?

05:40.382 --> 05:43.634
It is. I was looking at it,
and can I have one?

Well, it's a prototype.
It's a one-off.
Okay.

We'll get out,
but don't push me.

05:50.767 --> 05:54.437

We haven't finished
the thing.

05:54.521 --> 05:55.688
You go out now.
Yeah.

on Austria's greatest man

he was brave enough

that the fashion world was
superficial und vacuous.

So, I decided instead
to go to Los Angeles
to become a celebrity.

No, Lloyd, I was not
speaking to you. I was just
talking to the woman here.

14:32.163 --> 14:33.413
Who's got the audio?

14:34.499 --> 14:36.792
I want to hear
the audio back.
I want you to hear...

14:36.876 --> 14:39.002
I want you to hear
what this fool is saying.

How important is it for you
to help other people?

Helping other people
is so vital to my life.

we haven't actually spoke

We won't go there.

That was a very

18:03.249 --> 18:04.666

18:04.834 --> 18:06.918
And it's very important
what scores you give it,

18:07.003 --> 18:09.421
because if the show
scores over an 85%,

18:09.505 --> 18:12.466
the network's obviously
gonna be very interested.
So take a look.

What do you think there?
Is that a white-trash fetus?

28:26.830 --> 28:28.498

Sting's got the Amazon,
and Bono's got AIDS.

left to fix,

28:37.966 --> 28:39.300

Mein Plan was to get both
sides to sign a peace deal
in front of the world's press,

28:46.808 --> 28:48.976
making Brüno über famous.

29:25.973 --> 29:28.891
I mean,
isn't pita bread
the real enemy?

29:29.393 --> 29:32.019
You're confusing Hamas
with hummus, I believe.

29:32.854 --> 29:34.105
Hummus has nothing
to do with Hamas.
Do you think

29:34.189 --> 29:36.607
there is a relation
between Hamas and hummus?

29:36.692 --> 29:40.069
So was the founder
of Hamas a chef?

29:40.988 --> 29:46.117
He had created
the food and then
got lots of followers.

29:46.201 --> 29:52.206
Hummus has nothing to do
with Hamas. It's a food.
Okay? We eat it. They eat it.

29:52.583 --> 29:55.501
It's vegetarian.
It's healthy. It's beans.

29:57.087 --> 29:59.880
Well, do you
both agree on that?
Hmm?

30:00.215 --> 30:03.050
We both agree that
hummus is very healthy.

30:03.343 --> 30:05.344
So we're making progress.

a solution, right?

be here forever.
Will you, the Palestinians,

the pyramids back

because he's a black baby

walk in the park with

remind you of that,
then I say go for it

and play the clarinet
with everything
inside of you.

then I say put it down,

if I put a flute
up my stinker?

to gay guys. They see me
und they want to schtupp me.

against those guys?

spot the homosexual?

don't even dress no different
than myself or you.

You know?

52:30.356 --> 52:32.565

has infiltrated

52:36.445 --> 52:39.489
and he dresses
like the policemen,
how would you know that's him?

52:39.573 --> 52:41.783
What are obvious things
that we can look for?

52:41.867 --> 52:46.162
Obvious is a person
that's being extremely nice
to them to start with.

52:46.413 --> 52:50.958
So if someone approaches you
in the street und is being
very, very nice to you,

52:51.043 --> 52:52.835
you know that
they are a homosexual?

52:52.920 --> 52:54.295
Most likely.

How should I protect myself
from being attacked
by homosexuals?

52:59.927 --> 53:04.138
They probably would
attack from behind.

against a black dildo?

as the other
to defend against.

55:30.410 --> 55:33.204
Could you hold
the sheet over there?

55:33.288 --> 55:34.247
I'm not holding
anything.

55:34.373 --> 55:35.706
Get down.
Get down.
Was?

55:35.791 --> 55:38.084
I said, get down!
Do push ups.

This line right here is
a line that you don't cross.

55:41.088 --> 55:43.631
This is TAC Alley.
TAC Officer's...

55:43.715 --> 55:45.967
You're in it again.
This is my alley.

55:46.051 --> 55:47.218
I don't want to be
in your alley.

55:47.302 --> 55:50.596
Yeah, well, get out of it.
Your finger's in my alley.

55:51.098 --> 55:52.348
Not yet.

55:55.269 --> 55:58.187
By the way,
where's your uniform?
Go get your uniform on.

Oh, my gosh.

56:03.485 --> 56:05.361
What's up with the scarf?

56:05.445 --> 56:06.988
That is, like,
it's my own thing.

56:07.072 --> 56:09.574
Let me introduce you
to somebody.
Captain Miles.

56:09.658 --> 56:11.367
Candidate,
what are you doing?

56:11.451 --> 56:13.160
Stand at the position
of attention, candidate.

56:13.245 --> 56:15.746
Do it! Do it!
Head and eyes
straight forward, candidate.

56:15.831 --> 56:18.374
Head and eyes
straight forward.
Stand still, candidate.

56:18.458 --> 56:21.002
That is not part of
the uniform, candidate.
You need to take that off.

56:21.086 --> 56:23.921
This outfit is too
matchy-matchy as it is,

56:24.006 --> 56:27.884
and so I was just trying
to break it up with some
simple horizontal lines.

56:27.968 --> 56:30.845
Do you have an attitude,
candidate?
Do we detect an attitude?

56:30.929 --> 56:34.473
Sir, she's got an attitude.
MILES: What?

56:34.558 --> 56:37.018
Sir Officer Candidate,
did you just call me "she"?

56:37.144 --> 56:39.145
Get down, candidate!
Now!
Do it!

56:39.229 --> 56:41.397
What type belt is that,
candidate?

56:41.481 --> 56:42.773
What is that?

56:42.858 --> 56:44.734
D&G.
What is D&G?

56:44.818 --> 56:46.861
Dolce und Gabbana.
Hello?

56:46.945 --> 56:47.904

Get down, you!

56:49.865 --> 56:53.826
Sir Officer Candidate,
you deserve a medal
for exceptional skin.

What are you talking...
What are you trying
to say, candidate?

56:56.914 --> 56:58.956
Sir Officer Candidate,
you could be a general

56:59.041 --> 57:01.792
in the Bitch Army
the way you're going.

57:01.877 --> 57:03.628
Did you use profanity again?
Did you use profanity?

57:03.712 --> 57:04.962
But you're being
really nasty.

57:05.047 --> 57:08.883
The OC guide states that
I will not use profanity
while I'm at OCS.

57:08.967 --> 57:11.636
Yes, mein Führer.
Yes, Officer Candidate.

about the person
that changed my life?

57:45.671 --> 57:47.546
Was it Karl Lagerfeld?

57:47.839 --> 57:52.176
No, actually, his name
is Jesus. Jesus is
in this room right now.

57:52.260 --> 57:54.720
He never leaves us.
He never forsakes us.

57:54.805 --> 57:55.805
(WHISPERS) He's here.

57:55.889 --> 57:57.056
(WHISPERS) Amazing.

57:57.140 --> 57:58.724
That's exactly right.
He's amazing.

57:58.809 --> 58:02.520
You want to be famous.
You'll be one
that's so famous, Brüno,

58:02.604 --> 58:06.273
you will prepare the way
for other young men
all over the world

58:06.358 --> 58:10.319
who want to come out of
the homosexual lifestyle and
make a change in their lives.

58:10.404 --> 58:13.239
And they'll say,
"If Brüno can do it,
then I can do it.

58:13.323 --> 58:15.533
"How did he change?
How did you change, Brüno?"

58:15.617 --> 58:18.494
And they'll say,
"It's Jesus. He changed me."

58:18.578 --> 58:20.663
But he wants to come into
your heart right now.

58:20.747 --> 58:23.040
Are you ready to
make that change?

58:23.125 --> 58:25.042
Are you hitting on me?

58:26.044 --> 58:27.461
No, I'm not.

Okay, good, 'cause I just...
That was, like, really hot,
that whole speech.

suffocate a hamster
in Mykonos.

Do you prefer the vagina
or the mammary glands?

59:09.421 --> 59:11.630
I prefer the vagina.

and saying how much
we enjoy them.

You haven't?
How's it feel?

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:27.289
I feel a bit vulnerable.

they appear to us

somewhat irritating

01:06:45.793 --> 01:06:48.503
I didn't come here

Me, neither.
Okay.

01:06:56.971 --> 01:06:58.138
Hi.
JACK: Did he not
try to pull

01:06:58.223 --> 01:06:59.890
that queer shit

Hi. How you doing?

01:06:59.974 --> 01:07:02.267
JACK: I don't need
this motherfucker
touching me on the back,

01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:04.394
telling me to look him
in the fucking eye. Right?

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:08.023
I was just going
to the kitchen.
I know, yeah. Come on.

01:07:08.816 --> 01:07:11.902
What's this shit?
Let's take this off.

01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:15.572
Let's maybe we get
to know each other
a little.

actually.
I don't give a fuck.

I don't want you
to do something
that you'll regret.

01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:33.298
You wake up tomorrow,
you've lost your virginity,
and you feel ashamed.

01:07:33.383 --> 01:07:36.718
You know, let's take
this a little slower.

01:07:36.803 --> 01:07:38.887
We should reschedule.
Sit the fuck down.

01:07:38.972 --> 01:07:40.555

Ow!

01:07:40.848 --> 01:07:42.266
Don't fuck around!

If he gives
his permission...
What?

01:07:50.984 --> 01:07:52.359
Would you quit being
a little bitch here

01:07:52.443 --> 01:07:55.320
and take
your little briefs off
before I fucking rip them?

01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:57.072
Wait. Yes.

01:07:57.156 --> 01:07:58.240
Yeah.
Fine.

01:07:58.324 --> 01:07:59.408
Thanks.
Okay. Great.

01:07:59.492 --> 01:08:01.410
I don't like
this little shit.

01:08:01.494 --> 01:08:03.912
Yes, well,
I want to really make
this heterosexual sex.

01:08:03.997 --> 01:08:05.872
It's going to be
fantastisch!

01:08:05.957 --> 01:08:09.918

You gotta fold that neatly.
You don't treat suede
like that. It stains.

Sit the fuck down.
Take it off!

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:22.430
I've got an idea.
Let's play a little bit
of dress-up here.

01:08:22.515 --> 01:08:23.473
It will be erotisch.

01:08:23.558 --> 01:08:25.517
What is this?
You gonna dress me
like a man?

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:26.977
No, it's just a beard.

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:28.645
Am I supposed
to wear a beard?
It's just a...

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:30.104
Come on,
it will be fun.

01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:31.398
I don't need a beard.

01:08:31.482 --> 01:08:32.899
