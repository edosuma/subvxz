WEBVTT

00:08.750 --> 00:10.250
Cha-chung!

00:21.083 --> 00:22.750
-Ay!

00:22.833 --> 00:24.833
My lord, Teca is under attack.

00:27.291 --> 00:29.083
They have come for Maya.

00:29.166 --> 00:32.541
-Hmm! But they will find only…

00:32.625 --> 00:35.375
-…our fury.

00:35.458 --> 00:39.166
-Oh! Yes, they will.

00:57.291 --> 01:00.375
Seven will be difficult, mi amor.

01:00.458 --> 01:02.666
And you are pregnant.

01:02.750 --> 01:06.250
It's never stopped me before.
I will take the lead, husband.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.333
As you wish, my queen.

01:08.416 --> 01:10.583
For Maya!

01:32.458 --> 01:33.666
-That not good.

01:33.750 --> 01:36.375
-Oh no! Teca!

01:36.875 --> 01:39.125
-My parents!

01:40.458 --> 01:42.375
-Andale, Chiapa!

01:55.000 --> 01:57.208
They came here looking for me.

02:01.125 --> 02:03.333
-Chiapa, go find mamá y papá.

02:03.416 --> 02:05.458
-I will stop this golem.

02:05.916 --> 02:07.708
Hey! Over here!

02:08.291 --> 02:09.875
You looking for me?

02:09.958 --> 02:12.041
You've got me!

02:43.833 --> 02:45.000
Ha!

02:51.916 --> 02:54.208
-Boom shakalak-- Whoa!

03:03.875 --> 03:07.291
Thanks for helping.
Again, I'm so sorry I lied to you.

03:07.375 --> 03:10.541
-Just because we're mad at you…
-Doesn't mean we're gonna abandon you.

03:11.458 --> 03:13.083
You drop this.

03:14.208 --> 03:17.625
Thank you.
I'm so relieved you forgive me.

03:20.458 --> 03:24.041
-I-- I'm not off the hook, am I?
-Not even close, princesa.

03:24.125 --> 03:25.625
I still expect to meet my mother.

03:30.166 --> 03:31.000
You did?

03:32.500 --> 03:34.750
Come on. Chiapa found my parents.

03:36.458 --> 03:38.375
-Mama!
-Maya!

03:38.958 --> 03:40.583
Where's Papa?

03:43.250 --> 03:44.541
Hola, mija.

03:44.625 --> 03:45.875
Papa!

03:46.916 --> 03:50.583
I can't lift this.

03:50.666 --> 03:52.833
If only we had gotten here sooner.

03:52.916 --> 03:55.458
Mija, we have to get this monster off him.

03:55.541 --> 03:58.208
Okay, we need some ropes,
some wood, and at least four

03:58.291 --> 03:59.916
-to seventeen men--

04:00.000 --> 04:01.875
-Or Picchu could do that.

04:01.958 --> 04:05.875
I'm just going to close my eyes for a bit.

04:05.958 --> 04:07.375
It's all right, gordo.

04:07.458 --> 04:08.666
Just rest.

04:08.750 --> 04:11.833
Mama, you're-- you're expecting?

04:12.833 --> 04:16.708
I don't know why they call it expecting.
It's never when you expect it.

04:16.791 --> 04:17.666
Ay, Mama.

04:17.750 --> 04:18.875
No time to talk.

04:18.958 --> 04:23.375
-Let's get your father to the healers.
-Ay! Oh. We showed them golems.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.500
We showed them.

04:29.125 --> 04:31.458
The healers have given
your father medicine.

04:33.125 --> 04:36.291
Blue corn tortillas! Blue corn tortillas!

04:36.916 --> 04:38.250
Very strong medicine.

04:38.333 --> 04:42.208
Blue corn tortillas!

04:42.291 --> 04:44.500
So… that's my papa.

04:44.583 --> 04:46.791
Blue corn tortillas!

04:46.875 --> 04:49.000
-Husband, focus.

04:49.083 --> 04:50.291
You do'd it!

04:50.375 --> 04:55.250
These must be
the warriors of the prophecy.

04:55.333 --> 04:57.916
Wait. They look so young.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.125
Like bebés gigantes.

05:01.625 --> 05:04.291
Mama, Papa, this is Rico,

05:04.375 --> 05:07.208
the greatest Rooster Wizard
from Luna Island.

05:07.291 --> 05:10.958
He's dazzled me with his magic
and humbled me with his bravery.

05:11.458 --> 05:12.875
I'm forever in his debt.

05:13.666 --> 05:15.500
Nice to meet you,

05:15.583 --> 05:17.958
-Your Majestic Majesty.

05:19.666 --> 05:22.666
-Excuse me if I don't get up.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.500
I can't feel my legs.

05:27.166 --> 05:30.375
-This is Chimi, the deadly Skull Archer

05:30.458 --> 05:31.875
from the Jungle Lands.

05:31.958 --> 05:34.625
She's the most skilled fighter
I've ever seen,

05:34.708 --> 05:37.583
and has the kindest heart
in all three kingdoms.

05:38.666 --> 05:40.708
-Mm-hmm.

05:40.791 --> 05:43.416
Are you the ghost of a ghost?

05:43.500 --> 05:45.333
Maybe someday if I'm lucky.

05:45.416 --> 05:47.875
Ooh!

05:47.958 --> 05:48.875
Ay, ay, ay!

05:48.958 --> 05:53.833
And this is Picchu, the brave Puma Warrior
from the Golden Mountains.

05:53.916 --> 05:56.208
I'm proud to fight beside him,

05:56.291 --> 05:59.541
-and I'm in awe of his strength and honor.

06:00.291 --> 06:01.916
Picchu glad meet you.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.625
You're a big boy, aren't you?

06:04.708 --> 06:08.041
Someone's been eating
his blue corn tortillas.

06:08.125 --> 06:09.708
-Ay, gordo.

06:10.416 --> 06:13.458
Mama, the four of us
were a mighty team, but now--

06:16.416 --> 06:19.166
Oh, for the gods' sake. What now?

06:19.250 --> 06:20.625
I'll get my-- my armor.

06:20.708 --> 06:23.041
No, you stay with Papa. He needs you.

06:23.125 --> 06:26.083
-Chiapa, guard them with your life.

06:26.166 --> 06:27.833
We will… handle this.

06:30.833 --> 06:35.666
Can't we space these fights out more? Huh?
Why has fighting become normal, anyway?

06:35.750 --> 06:40.083
Look, you know how many fights I got in
before I met you? Huh, Maya? Zero.

06:42.958 --> 06:46.291
This seem like
normal amount of fights to Picchu.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.083
Fine. Even Picchu worry. You happy now?

07:03.166 --> 07:06.458
-Hey! You're-- You're not welcome here.

07:06.541 --> 07:11.208
I am Chivo, god of dark magic.

07:15.416 --> 07:19.583
We are Bone and Skull,
goddesses of thievery!

07:22.208 --> 07:27.000
-I am Vucub, god of jungle animals!

07:28.791 --> 07:31.166
And I am Xtabay…

07:31.750 --> 07:34.666
…goddess of illusions.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.458
We are here for the half-breed.

07:40.541 --> 07:43.083
Hand her over and just walk away.

07:43.166 --> 07:45.750
This will bring an end to the horror.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.416
Walk away.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
They all have golden talismans.

07:54.083 --> 07:56.750
-Whoa!
-Quiet!

07:56.833 --> 07:59.916
These puny humans are no match for gods.

08:01.750 --> 08:04.916
-Hi, girl who will get…
-…everyone killed.

08:09.416 --> 08:10.416
I got these two.

08:10.500 --> 08:12.333
-Split up and get the others.

08:12.416 --> 08:16.333
-How-- How do we know who to face?
-You! The sewer rat apprentice.

08:16.416 --> 08:18.708
-Ah! I hate goats!

08:18.791 --> 08:20.375
-Ah!

08:22.291 --> 08:25.000
Excuse me, Chimi.
May I have a word with you?

08:27.625 --> 08:28.625
Chimi!

08:28.708 --> 08:29.958
-Huh?

08:30.041 --> 08:33.041
It's just you and me, handsome.

08:33.833 --> 08:36.083
Oh.

08:37.666 --> 08:40.333
We're taking you to Lord Mictlan.

08:40.416 --> 08:44.041
But maybe we steal your treasure
before we steal you.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
What a dump.

08:50.250 --> 08:53.583
There's got to be something
worth stealing around here.

08:53.666 --> 08:55.750
I don't know, sister.

08:55.833 --> 08:58.750
-Everything looks lame.

09:00.291 --> 09:02.958
-Colibrí! G-Get-- Get in the cage.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.083
Huh. You really
have nothing worth stealing.

09:07.541 --> 09:10.625
-Hmm… Or do you?

09:17.625 --> 09:20.875
The Nefarious Bandit Queen's earrings!

09:20.958 --> 09:24.208
How does it look?
Do I have the right bone structure?

09:24.291 --> 09:26.000
My brother gave that to me.

09:27.125 --> 09:28.500
Ay!

09:28.583 --> 09:30.791
Check it out, the Golden Pearl!

09:30.875 --> 09:33.041
-Hey! Put that back.

09:33.125 --> 09:37.166
Join us, Maya!
Together, we can overthrow Lord Mictlan.

09:37.250 --> 09:38.166
What?

09:38.250 --> 09:40.791
-Nobody wants you around here anyway.

09:40.875 --> 09:43.833
Your mama isn't even your real mama.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.250
You shut your mouth!

09:46.333 --> 09:49.625
-Ooh! I guess that one hurt, huh?

09:49.708 --> 09:51.458
-Colibrí!

09:51.541 --> 09:54.750
-Give those back!

10:00.583 --> 10:02.791
-Poor little princesa,

10:02.875 --> 10:05.083
stuck between two worlds.

10:05.166 --> 10:07.916
-And she doesn't belong to either.

10:08.000 --> 10:14.833
Face it, Maya, you're just a product
of your papa's biggest indiscreción.

10:14.916 --> 10:17.041
-Yeah, I said it.

10:17.583 --> 10:20.208
-I am a friend to all animals.

10:20.291 --> 10:23.208
No, you are a traitor.

10:23.708 --> 10:25.875
And I must end you.

10:25.958 --> 10:28.833
-You let your animal family die!

10:30.375 --> 10:32.958
After they raised you as their own.

10:38.416 --> 10:42.750
-Now you pay for your betrayal.

10:45.750 --> 10:46.750
Wait!

10:47.333 --> 10:48.166
Huh.

10:49.291 --> 10:53.125
I don't wanna hurt them if I fall.
None of this is their fault.

10:58.041 --> 10:59.625
I'm ready when you are.

10:59.708 --> 11:04.625
How could you side with humans now,
after they shunned you, Chimi?

11:04.708 --> 11:07.333
I am learning they're not all bad.

11:07.416 --> 11:10.833
You trusted the half-breed girl,
and she lied to you.

11:10.916 --> 11:12.250
-But--
-Have you forgotten?

11:12.333 --> 11:17.000
Humans murdered your animal family.
Why would they not betray you now?

11:17.500 --> 11:19.166
I ask you, Chimi,

11:19.250 --> 11:22.708
-have you forgotten your real family?

11:25.416 --> 11:28.583
Monkey, I'm sorry!

11:28.666 --> 11:30.833
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

11:33.208 --> 11:35.291
-Who this?

11:35.375 --> 11:37.000
I am Xtabay.

11:37.750 --> 11:39.250
-Huh?
-Or…

11:42.791 --> 11:44.041
…maybe I'm Maya.

11:44.125 --> 11:47.000
Maybe I'm this idiot.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.833
Or maybe I'm the girl you like.

11:52.166 --> 11:56.458
Whoever I am, I am your worst nightmare.

11:59.791 --> 12:01.375
Huh?

12:04.791 --> 12:07.791
Picchu, we are so proud of you.

12:07.875 --> 12:11.416
Son good warrior. Best all time.

12:11.500 --> 12:15.041
-Picchu proud be your son.

12:17.125 --> 12:18.458
This not real.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.916
-No!

12:25.000 --> 12:26.333
-Huh?

12:30.041 --> 12:34.291
Make stop. Make stop.
Picchu no can watch.

12:34.875 --> 12:37.000
You let this happen, Picchu.

12:37.083 --> 12:38.000
You.

12:38.083 --> 12:40.416
If it weren't for you showing mercy…

12:40.500 --> 12:42.916
Your family
would still be alive.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
No!

12:46.166 --> 12:48.833
-If it weren't for you…

12:48.916 --> 12:52.041
-…your brothers would be alive.

12:52.125 --> 12:57.041
You are the worst thing to happen
to Teca and your familia.

12:58.083 --> 13:00.083
-We can defeat Lord Mictlan.
-Huh?

13:00.166 --> 13:02.000
It'll be just the three of us,

13:02.083 --> 13:04.541
ruling the underworld.

13:04.625 --> 13:08.541
Do it for your family.
They're better off without you anyway.

13:08.625 --> 13:11.500
Plus, Zatz will be there.

13:14.500 --> 13:18.625
-So, what do you say? Join us, hermanita.

13:18.708 --> 13:19.958
-No.

13:20.041 --> 13:23.083
-I am the Eagle Warrior of the prophecy.

13:23.166 --> 13:25.041
-I am not one of you.

13:26.041 --> 13:28.875
Well, we tried.
Take the pearl and the earring, right?

13:28.958 --> 13:31.916
Yeah, but leave the stupid bird.
That thing's worthless.

13:35.291 --> 13:38.458
Time to knock this chick out
and stuff her in a sack, right?

13:38.541 --> 13:42.625
-Go ahead. Make your move.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.708
-You stupid little brat.

13:51.791 --> 13:54.375
One human can't stand against the gods.

13:55.875 --> 13:57.833
-You're right.

14:15.583 --> 14:19.166
-Come on, Colibrí. Let's get the others.

14:19.250 --> 14:20.666
-I'm sorry!

14:20.750 --> 14:22.416
-I'm sorry.

14:28.333 --> 14:31.166
Yes, if it weren't for me,
they'd still be alive.

14:32.541 --> 14:33.916
And so would my mother.

14:34.416 --> 14:39.083
So you agree you deserve to die,
as do all humans.

14:39.166 --> 14:44.208
No. I now have met humans
who have… shown kindness to me.

14:45.291 --> 14:47.333
They've accepted me as their own.

14:49.291 --> 14:50.791
And I have accepted them.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.083
Stop!

15:02.166 --> 15:04.416
Why would you do this?

15:04.500 --> 15:06.375
I don't want us to hurt each other,

15:06.458 --> 15:09.458
-but I will gladly die defending my pack.

15:09.541 --> 15:11.750
-Chimi!

15:11.833 --> 15:13.958
-Maya!
-Are you all right?

15:14.041 --> 15:15.041
Do you need help?

15:18.916 --> 15:20.000
Hmm.

15:21.166 --> 15:22.916
-Ooh.
-This is my friend Colibrí.

15:28.041 --> 15:30.458
Come on. We have to help Rico and Picchu.

15:32.541 --> 15:34.166
Hmm.

15:36.083 --> 15:37.166
Huh?

15:39.458 --> 15:42.791
Spare me, and I swear
you will never see me again.

15:49.291 --> 15:50.541
-No.

15:50.625 --> 15:52.750
Do it. What are you waiting for?

15:52.833 --> 15:53.750
This is it,

15:53.833 --> 15:56.583
-the moment you made your great mistake.

15:56.666 --> 15:58.416
-Do it, Picchu!

16:02.750 --> 16:06.333
-Mercy is never mistake.

16:07.625 --> 16:10.333
-Then you will die like your family.

16:13.541 --> 16:15.791
Let me show you how it's done.

16:17.958 --> 16:20.208
You fight Picchu, you fight us all!

16:20.291 --> 16:21.541
-Huh?

16:23.166 --> 16:24.916
Stay away from him, you witch.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.250
-Ah!

16:36.791 --> 16:37.833
Estefan!

16:37.916 --> 16:43.458
Not only did you kill the Gran Brujo,
you broke his golden talisman.

16:43.541 --> 16:45.625
You are diabolical.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.875
Listen here, mocoso.

16:50.958 --> 16:54.250
Why don't you use your staff
like a civilized wizard?

16:54.333 --> 16:57.958
-Yes. Yes.

16:58.041 --> 17:00.208
Estefan! You all right?

17:01.333 --> 17:03.833
W-- W-- W-Wait a second.
Why did you do this for me?

17:03.916 --> 17:07.916
Well, how would it look if I,
Chivo, the god of dark magic,

17:08.000 --> 17:11.333
defeated a pathetic worm
with a broken staff?

17:11.416 --> 17:12.416
Huh?

17:12.500 --> 17:16.583
Now let me show you
what real Peasant Magic looks like, fool.

17:25.916 --> 17:28.541
Now let's see
if you're really okay. Terebro!

17:30.958 --> 17:32.041
Oh no.

17:32.125 --> 17:35.625
You almost g-g-g-g-g-got me.

17:35.708 --> 17:40.291
Let me know when you're done playing
and can do some actual magic.

17:40.375 --> 17:42.291
Oh yeah? Try this.

17:42.375 --> 17:44.750
-Fulminis!

17:50.250 --> 17:51.416
Strangulatus!

17:52.166 --> 17:56.541
Don't you know that the others can see you
for the failure you really are?

17:57.041 --> 18:00.750
They're not really your friends.
They got stuck with you,

18:00.833 --> 18:04.583
just like the Gran Bru-hoo-hoo-hoo-jo.

18:10.541 --> 18:13.000
The only remarkable thing you've ever done

18:13.083 --> 18:16.125
was kill the one person
who cared about you.

18:16.208 --> 18:19.083
And now you will get your friends killed.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.666
-No.
-Say it.

18:21.125 --> 18:23.916
-Say "I am worthless."

18:24.000 --> 18:26.583
Admit it, and I will let you live.

18:26.666 --> 18:28.083
Admit it!

18:28.166 --> 18:30.500
I am worthless.

18:34.750 --> 18:36.750
I-- I'm sorry, Gran Brujo!

18:36.833 --> 18:39.083
I don't need to defeat you.

18:39.166 --> 18:41.541
You defeated yourself.

18:41.625 --> 18:43.791
Time to die.

18:43.875 --> 18:46.041
-Get away from him!
-Aya!

18:46.125 --> 18:47.458
Taste my ax!

18:51.833 --> 18:54.833
-You fight Rico…
-You fight us all.

18:58.416 --> 19:00.791
-He's gone. Rico?

19:04.375 --> 19:08.375
-Estefan, you fixed him, Rico.
-Estefan was broken?

19:10.125 --> 19:12.125
Rico, are you okay?

19:17.958 --> 19:20.375
Don't worry about me. I-- I-- I got it.

19:20.458 --> 19:22.458
I'm-- I'm-- I'm fine. I'm fine.

19:22.541 --> 19:25.083
Yeah, Es-- Estefan is like new.

19:25.166 --> 19:26.166
Listen to me.

19:26.250 --> 19:29.291
Our weapons,
they can hurt the gods.

19:29.791 --> 19:30.833
-Hmm.

19:30.916 --> 19:32.625
Hmm. That's right.

19:32.708 --> 19:35.208
Chivo said they're golden talismans.

19:35.291 --> 19:38.041
-They're made from the blood of gods.

19:38.125 --> 19:39.875
Gods bleed gold?

19:41.000 --> 19:43.750
-Picchu like see that.
-Hardcore.

19:43.833 --> 19:45.458
But why does mine not glow?

19:46.125 --> 19:48.083
Hmm. Gran Brujo taught us

19:48.166 --> 19:51.500
that gold talismans
don't respond to thoughts.

19:51.583 --> 19:53.958
-They respond to feelings!

19:54.041 --> 19:56.125
Emotions like love and anger and--

19:56.208 --> 19:58.083
Axes, be magic now.

20:00.541 --> 20:02.166
Anger work good.

20:03.250 --> 20:06.291
-Guys, Chivo fixed Estefan.
-Why would he do that?

20:06.375 --> 20:11.625
Chivo didn't fix… Esss-stefan
because he was being fair.

20:12.250 --> 20:16.166
He fixed you because
he didn't want me using Peasant Magic.

20:16.250 --> 20:17.708
He's afraid of it!

20:19.458 --> 20:21.958
-Okay, we got this.

20:23.125 --> 20:24.166
They here.

20:24.250 --> 20:27.000
Ax, kill goat god!

20:28.500 --> 20:30.875
You'll pay for that, barbarian.

20:31.916 --> 20:34.958
Plenty more where that come from, fool.

20:51.250 --> 20:54.583
Please, golden totem, I need this.

20:54.666 --> 20:55.750
For my friends.

20:55.833 --> 20:58.791
-It worked!

21:00.916 --> 21:03.250
Magic arrows!

21:03.333 --> 21:04.625
Oh yeah! It's on.

21:04.708 --> 21:06.541
You amaze me, Chimi.

21:06.625 --> 21:10.041
-Team stay together this time. Okay?

21:11.250 --> 21:13.583
Let's finish what we started.

21:13.666 --> 21:15.583
-Hey, goat face!

21:15.666 --> 21:18.000
-We will fight on our terms!

21:18.083 --> 21:22.083
Selfish Princess Maya
and the three outcasts.

21:22.166 --> 21:25.291
You have all brought harm
to the ones you love.

21:25.375 --> 21:28.875
Fitting that you will all fail together.

21:37.083 --> 21:41.333
Dragón mágico, fire away.
Chivo malvado, time to pay!

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
-We are the prophecy!

21:50.250 --> 21:52.083
Together, we stronger.

21:52.166 --> 21:53.333
Dang right.

21:54.458 --> 21:55.500
-Hmm?

21:59.750 --> 22:02.541
-Cover me, Chimi.

22:02.625 --> 22:03.791
Die, skele-twins!

22:03.875 --> 22:05.666
-Skele-twins?

22:06.875 --> 22:10.500
-You are no match, peasant!

22:15.208 --> 22:17.958
-You are no match for a god!

22:29.916 --> 22:31.541
One for you.

22:32.583 --> 22:34.250
-And three for you!

22:34.333 --> 22:35.833
Gracias, Chimi!

22:44.166 --> 22:46.083
-Huh?

22:49.333 --> 22:51.958
Who wants some? Huh?

22:52.041 --> 22:54.666
Fight me, bird-faced god.

22:59.416 --> 23:03.208
-You are truly merciful, barbarian.

23:03.291 --> 23:07.625
Hmm. Parents raised Picchu right.

23:08.833 --> 23:12.166
Okay, who wants some more?

23:18.333 --> 23:20.000
I got you, Maya.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.291
-Ooh!
-Stop moving.

23:32.875 --> 23:34.958
-My bracelet! Mine!

23:35.041 --> 23:37.500
Girl! I said give it to me!

23:37.583 --> 23:40.500
-Ow!
-That's my bracelet!

23:40.583 --> 23:43.500
Chimi, can I use the string
from your magic bow?

23:43.583 --> 23:47.250
-Let me see if I can get it off. Whoa!
-Perfect! How did you do that?

23:47.333 --> 23:48.583
I have no idea.

23:53.625 --> 23:55.500
-Steal this!

23:55.583 --> 23:57.708
Help me, Skull!

23:58.291 --> 24:01.500
That's it! I don't care
what Lord Mictlan ordered.

24:01.583 --> 24:06.791
We're gonna kill you
and become all-powerful ourselves.

24:11.291 --> 24:12.791
Eagle Claw!

24:12.875 --> 24:15.208
-Adios, princesita.

24:15.291 --> 24:17.250
Colibrí, get in her head!

24:19.291 --> 24:22.666
Get it out of me!
Get it out of me!

24:25.583 --> 24:27.583
Ah!

24:40.916 --> 24:43.833
-You… How did you--

24:44.416 --> 24:47.375
-A human can't kill a god.

24:47.458 --> 24:51.083
This is why
Lord Mictlan fears her.

24:54.875 --> 24:56.750
I will avenge you, sister.

24:56.833 --> 24:58.333
This I swear!

24:58.833 --> 25:00.958
Eh… But not today. Bye.

25:14.416 --> 25:15.541
Huh.

25:17.708 --> 25:18.541
What?

25:19.833 --> 25:25.125
-What did I just do? I killed a god.
-Yeah, don't feel bad. It was you or her.

25:25.208 --> 25:28.500
I mean, besides, she was already dead.
She was a skeleton.

25:30.750 --> 25:31.791
Gracias, Colibrí.

25:33.291 --> 25:35.500
Thank you for your gifts, brothers.

25:35.583 --> 25:39.583
From the bottom of my heart,
thank you three for fighting by my side.

25:39.666 --> 25:41.875
And I should have never lied to you.

25:41.958 --> 25:44.708
I'll understand
if you never forgive me. What?

25:44.791 --> 25:47.208
-Yes, you lied to us.

25:47.291 --> 25:49.208
But none of us are perfect.

25:49.291 --> 25:53.958
-Hmm. Chimi pretty close.
-Shut your mouth.

25:54.041 --> 25:59.083
And if we can't forgive you,
how can we ever forgive our-- ourselves?

25:59.166 --> 26:01.750
-Uh… Fist hug?
-Not a chance.

26:14.541 --> 26:17.583
You should have seen us, Papa.
We were unstoppable.

26:17.666 --> 26:21.375
And I can actually kill the gods.
It's why Mictlan is afraid of me.

26:21.458 --> 26:23.958
Who's Papa's little god-killer?!

26:27.000 --> 26:29.166
He's still getting
a lot of medicinal herbs.

26:30.166 --> 26:35.041
So that old club of mine
is made out of gods' blood?

26:35.125 --> 26:39.250
Man, that's-- that's-- Whoa, crazy, man.

26:39.333 --> 26:43.125
Seems like it would be
a little, eh, squishier.

26:46.833 --> 26:50.916
So, uh… Yeah, yeah, yeah, I--
I learned something today too. Mm-hmm.

26:51.000 --> 26:55.375
Very interesting.
Uh, it turns out my magic is so powerful,

26:55.458 --> 26:59.958
the god of dark magic himself
is afraid of moi.

27:00.041 --> 27:01.166
That's great, Rico.

27:01.250 --> 27:06.541
Picchu learn
mercy not something you give.

27:07.041 --> 27:07.916
Hmm.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.958
Mercy something you are.

27:11.041 --> 27:11.875
Aww.

27:11.958 --> 27:14.041
-That's so noble, Picchu.

27:15.291 --> 27:16.875
Hmm?

27:18.166 --> 27:23.291
Tomorrow, we ride for glory!

27:27.083 --> 27:31.083
Mama, Papa can't go with us
to destroy the Divine Gate.

27:31.166 --> 27:35.458
And neither can you.
You must protect Papa and the baby.

27:35.541 --> 27:36.416
I…

27:37.583 --> 27:38.708
I know, mija.

27:38.791 --> 27:41.041
The quest to destroy the Divine Gate

27:41.666 --> 27:44.791
will just be me
and the warriors of the prophecy.

27:44.875 --> 27:47.375
Chiapa will guide us. We got this.

27:47.458 --> 27:51.416
Mija, Lord Mictlan
is not like the other gods.

27:51.500 --> 27:56.000
What happened to your father and brothers,
it was worse than you can imagine.

27:58.541 --> 28:02.250
Just destroy the Divine Gate
and come home safe to me.

28:03.166 --> 28:06.000
I can't bear to lose anyone else.
You promise?

28:07.958 --> 28:09.083
I promise, Mama.

28:19.708 --> 28:22.708
-My mother is a monstruo.

28:22.791 --> 28:24.916
-The Divine Gate!

28:25.000 --> 28:27.625
The door between our realm
and the underworld.

28:34.708 --> 28:36.125
Never give up.

28:36.791 --> 28:38.666
-Fight till the end.

28:39.625 --> 28:41.125
Maybe live for cause.

28:42.166 --> 28:44.250
Maybe die for cause.
