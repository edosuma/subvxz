WEBVTT

00:02.654 --> 00:04.632
Evan has his footy pyjamas, a new diaper

00:04.633 --> 00:05.633
and we need a poo.

00:05.634 --> 00:08.863
So he has no excuse not
to sleep through the night.

00:08.864 --> 00:12.365
Oh, thank God. I am so tired, and
I have so much work to do tomorrrow.

00:12.664 --> 00:14.628
Well, maybe we should really be
thinking about doing something else.

00:14.628 --> 00:17.915
Honey, I'm sorry, but the press is
expecting me to announce my candidacy

00:17.915 --> 00:19.747
on the steps of city hall next week.

00:19.747 --> 00:21.584
Have I told you how much I love your lips?

00:22.781 --> 00:24.775
You and 77% of California.

00:25.172 --> 00:25.937
- Really?
- Yep.

00:26.257 --> 00:28.241
My pre-announcement polls came in, 

00:28.488 --> 00:31.633
and everybody agrees that my
lips are my greatest asset.

00:31.785 --> 00:33.124
Everybody loves my mouth.

00:33.124 --> 00:35.087
Yeah. What do they think about this spot?

00:36.059 --> 00:38.157
Uh, well, which spot?

00:39.043 --> 00:40.084
This one.

00:40.313 --> 00:42.553
Oh, well, I don't think
they did a poll on that spot.

00:42.989 --> 00:44.450
Mm, if they did, you'd win a landslide.

00:47.102 --> 00:47.934
Ignore it.

00:48.148 --> 00:49.033
Oh, no, I can't.

00:49.282 --> 00:52.059
Ugh. It's Buffy. That woman
has been calling me all day.

00:52.249 --> 00:53.949
You cannot hire her to
be your campaign manager.

00:54.330 --> 00:55.981
Ll, honey, I have to at
least give her a meeting.

00:56.117 --> 00:57.370
I mean, she is my friend.

00:57.554 --> 00:59.217
I don't care. Just tell her
she's not getting the job.

00:59.326 --> 01:00.428
I need that phone to stop ringing.

01:00.574 --> 01:02.354
She's the best political
strategist out there.

01:02.448 --> 01:05.866
- No, you're the best.
- Well, yes, but I can't hire myself, can I?

01:06.283 --> 01:07.285
Well, you'll figure something out.

01:08.341 --> 01:09.594
Mm. That... that would be you.

01:13.512 --> 01:14.488
Is this her number?

01:17.458 --> 01:18.570
She is relentless.

01:19.096 --> 01:19.998
Hello, Buffy.

01:21.011 --> 01:22.407
Yes, you are disturbing me, but go ahead.

01:24.325 --> 01:25.237
Okay, I'll talk to her.

01:26.334 --> 01:27.992
Tomorrow. I'll do it. Okay. Bye bye.

01:28.415 --> 01:29.434
All right, you have
brunch with her tomorrow

01:29.599 --> 01:30.975
and just put her out of her misery.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.806
No. I'm going to give
her a proper interview, 

01:33.028 --> 01:34.462
and if she doesn't
work out, then you and I

01:34.704 --> 01:36.194
are gonna hit the lists again on Sunday.

01:36.429 --> 01:37.809
Sunday is, uh, Valentine's day, 

01:38.285 --> 01:41.106
- and our sex-iversary. - Oh, well, 
that... that's not a real thing.

01:41.285 --> 01:42.536
It is, too.

01:43.490 --> 01:44.846
Oh, honey.

01:45.040 --> 01:48.350
Every day a holiday with you.

01:55.022 --> 01:56.468
So every painting is $500?

01:56.659 --> 01:57.711
Yeah, but they're anonymous.

01:57.873 --> 01:59.982
That way, the only reason to
buy it is because you like it.

02:00.798 --> 02:02.691
Oh, Rebecca loves this one... mm.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.334
But $500... you know, I can't afford that.

02:04.427 --> 02:05.538
Yeah, I know what you mean.

02:05.660 --> 02:07.338
I'm getting Kevin boxers
for Valentine's day.

02:07.544 --> 02:10.531
I was gonna go underwear, 
too, but she's pregnant.

02:10.621 --> 02:12.182
- You know, it seems a little inappropriate.
- Oh. Sure.

02:12.372 --> 02:14.762
But I... I don't know what to
do. I'm totally out of ideas.

02:15.354 --> 02:18.287
Wait. Are you asking me what to
get a woman for Valentine's day?

02:18.287 --> 02:20.342
Because the last
Valentine I gave to a woman

02:20.342 --> 02:23.399
was written in crayon, and there
were boxes for "yes" and "no."

02:24.152 --> 02:26.616
- Things were so much easier back then.
- Yeah.

02:26.754 --> 02:27.572
He's your boyfriend.

02:27.679 --> 02:28.971
You have to get him
something for Valentine's day.

02:29.194 --> 02:31.514
No, we've never actually used that word.

02:32.086 --> 02:33.887
You know, we haven't been
seeing each other that long.

02:34.024 --> 02:34.673
You're having sex, 

02:34.906 --> 02:37.088
so he's either your boyfriend
or a friend with benefits.

02:37.233 --> 02:38.008
Oh, God. I'm sorry, Kevin.

02:38.220 --> 02:40.606
There's gotta be something in between.

02:43.496 --> 02:45.778
Maybe, but that was
definitely a boyfriend wave.

02:46.480 --> 02:48.726
I don't get it. Two weeks
ago he was Mr. Perfect.

02:48.727 --> 02:49.815
No, I like Roy.

02:50.270 --> 02:51.637
You know I don't like Valentine's day.

02:51.941 --> 02:52.705
It's too much pressure, 

02:52.899 --> 02:55.184
and I don't see why I should
ha to define my relationship

02:55.515 --> 02:57.776
so that some greeting card
company can make money.

02:58.588 --> 03:01.035
I mean, it's the opposite of
romantic if you think about it.

03:02.167 --> 03:03.487
Yeah, it's not like
meeting a beautiful man

03:03.753 --> 03:06.665
- in the south of France.
- Stop it.

03:07.662 --> 03:09.407
Didn't he... no, I never texted back.

03:10.179 --> 03:11.867
I'm sorry. Has it ever occurred to you, 

03:11.969 --> 03:13.098
you might still be in love with Luc?

03:13.264 --> 03:16.204
Kevin, I was never in love
with Luc. I was enthralled.

03:16.204 --> 03:17.337
There is a difference.

03:17.533 --> 03:18.993
Secondly, it didn't work out.

03:19.798 --> 03:22.345
It was impractical, and I
am trying to be a grown-up.

03:22.479 --> 03:24.485
Right. So ask Roy to be your Valentine.

03:24.632 --> 03:26.369
It's no big deal. Even Paige
has a Valentine this year.

03:27.938 --> 03:29.710
- I'm sorry?
- Oh, you didn't...

03:29.887 --> 03:31.986
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, well, me and Paige are tight.

03:32.175 --> 03:32.889
Kevin!

03:33.099 --> 03:34.129
- Oh, Justin.
- Hey.

03:34.306 --> 03:35.003
Hey.

03:35.168 --> 03:38.812
So I think I have this great
idea for Sarah's Valentine gift.

03:39.052 --> 03:39.753
Oh, what is it?

03:41.035 --> 03:41.729
Roller skating.

03:42.627 --> 03:44.208
Oh. Ooh. Uh... no good?

03:44.347 --> 03:46.963
No. She actually broke her ankle
roller skating when she was 12.

03:47.217 --> 03:49.286
I think she still suffers from PTSD.

03:49.736 --> 03:53.444
Okay. Uh, I just thought it
would be retro and hilarious, 

03:54.078 --> 03:54.870
romantic in that, 

03:55.109 --> 03:58.181
Uh... Olivia Newton-John in "Xanadu"
kind of way. I totally get it.

03:58.291 --> 03:59.941
Okay. Well, l... let's think about
it. What else could you get her?

04:00.061 --> 04:02.725
I don't know. We're both kind
of practical people with kids, 

04:03.554 --> 04:05.329
which is why I thought about
doing something rather than a gift.

04:05.538 --> 04:06.535
We could spend some time alone.

04:07.387 --> 04:08.873
Wow. Yeah, you've really
thought about this.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.454
That's so nice.

04:10.723 --> 04:11.482
Yeah.

04:13.752 --> 04:14.582
It's so beautiful.

04:14.766 --> 04:16.607
Look at it... the color, the light.

04:17.152 --> 04:18.692
It's making me want to touch it.

04:18.832 --> 04:20.116
Don't. Here comes the gallery owner.

04:21.244 --> 04:22.069
It's a great piece, isn't it?

04:22.339 --> 04:23.887
Oh, yeah. It's so lovely.

04:24.563 --> 04:26.302
I know the paintings are
supposed to be anonymous, 

04:26.448 --> 04:29.354
but the artist of this particular
piece happens to be here.

04:29.513 --> 04:32.486
- I could arrange an introduction if you'd like.
- Oh, I'd love that.

04:32.486 --> 04:34.102
All right. I'll see if I can find him.

04:37.202 --> 04:38.535
There's a woman out front
who wants to meet you.

04:39.583 --> 04:40.787
Come here.

04:42.423 --> 04:43.464
There.

04:45.000 --> 04:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:55.166 --> 04:55.880
That's...

04:56.579 --> 04:57.138
That... that's okay.

04:57.261 --> 04:58.972
Just... just tell her I'm not here.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.430
- You really like it?
- I love it.

05:03.120 --> 05:06.601
Th... there's something about the
way the forms are so constrained

05:06.928 --> 05:07.953
and then this blue line in the middle

05:08.137 --> 05:09.708
just flies off the canvas like...

05:11.053 --> 05:14.891
Like it just wants to keep
going forever or you know...

05:17.554 --> 05:18.279
What do you think?

05:18.575 --> 05:21.564
Honestly, I think it looks like
something Libby did in second grade.

05:23.923 --> 05:25.384
I'm sorry. He wasn't here after all.

05:25.582 --> 05:28.775
Oh. Would you just tell him I loved?

05:29.007 --> 05:29.940
I will.

05:43.592 --> 05:45.069
Hey, what's going on?
Why are you still awake?

05:46.790 --> 05:48.327
There's something I need to tell you.

05:50.059 --> 05:51.047
Okay.

05:52.151 --> 05:54.287
The other night, when you proposed, 

05:55.408 --> 05:57.518
I had just come back
from a meeting with York.

05:57.806 --> 05:59.800
- Yeah?
- Well, he said that I was right

05:59.973 --> 06:01.404
about the hidden value of the company.

06:01.548 --> 06:03.071
There definitely is one.

06:05.232 --> 06:05.766
What is it?

06:06.921 --> 06:07.667
I still don't know.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.601
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.
- Oh, Holly. Come on.

06:09.954 --> 06:11.118
No, no, no. David...

06:12.170 --> 06:13.589
York tried to blackmail me.

06:15.296 --> 06:19.048
I was in his hotel room, and
he started coming on to me.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.159
And he said that he... he would tell me

06:22.299 --> 06:25.491
the secret and even make me
a partner if I slept with him.

06:26.256 --> 06:27.661
But I... I... I... I... I didn't.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.167
- You know, I... I wouldn't...
- I believe you, Holly. I believe you.

06:30.301 --> 06:31.603
- You... you do?
- Of course I do.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.644
All right, what, uh, 
what are you gonna do?

06:35.762 --> 06:37.031
You want me to deal with York?

06:37.204 --> 06:39.553
No. I just want him out of my life.

06:40.179 --> 06:41.717
All right, so when does
the deal go through?

06:42.941 --> 06:43.791
This afternoon.

06:44.652 --> 06:47.746
My bank said that they would
call me when his funds landed.

06:49.158 --> 06:51.943
But York has this major
grudge against the Walkers, 

06:51.943 --> 06:54.371
and when they find out
who I sold my shares to...

06:54.518 --> 06:55.443
Well, that's not your problem, 

06:55.666 --> 06:57.833
Holly. Yeah, but what about Rebecca, huh?

06:57.961 --> 07:00.658
- I mean, she lands right in the middle again.
- All right.

07:00.768 --> 07:03.628
Then you have to talk to
Rebecca before the bank calls.

07:04.334 --> 07:06.070
But don't get sentimental
about the Walkers.

07:06.425 --> 07:08.038
They're certainly not
sentimental about you.

07:08.280 --> 07:11.172
No, I know that's true.

07:12.499 --> 07:13.124
Look, um, 

07:14.183 --> 07:16.625
I'm supposed to get on this
plane in a couple of hours.

07:16.744 --> 07:18.765
- You want me to cancel the trip and stay?
- Oh, no, no. Go.

07:21.017 --> 07:22.640
I know what I have to do.

07:24.872 --> 07:25.915
Okay.

07:28.439 --> 07:29.934
I think it's in this book.

07:30.666 --> 07:31.841
It's not in that one.

07:32.308 --> 07:35.420
- Here it is... the brownie recipe.
- Wow.

07:35.683 --> 07:36.826
Yeah, look how old it is.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.871
But I made a copy. That one you can keep.

07:38.993 --> 07:40.697
Wait, wait, wait. You
make these from scratch?

07:40.801 --> 07:42.866
I thought it was a mix, that you
just added some things into it.

07:42.968 --> 07:43.885
A mix?

07:43.999 --> 07:47.323
You can't make Justin's
favorite brownies from a mix.

07:47.434 --> 07:49.700
- No, no, no.
- Did you always know how to bake

07:49.857 --> 07:53.087
- or did you learn when you had a family?
- I was raised in the '50s.

07:53.218 --> 07:56.379
All the girls... we learned how
to bake. We had home economics.

07:56.379 --> 07:57.924
Well, I didn't have home economics, 

07:58.232 --> 07:59.911
so you're gonna have
to talk me through this.

08:00.010 --> 08:00.989
Yes, I absolutely will.

08:01.102 --> 08:04.022
You know, I have this
fabulous tin in my office, 

08:04.123 --> 08:04.987
this little red tin.

08:05.116 --> 08:08.071
It's perfect, because
presentation is really half of it.

08:08.721 --> 08:11.413
Ow. Nora?

08:13.323 --> 08:15.134
Oh, my God. Oh. Nora?

08:15.917 --> 08:17.377
Oh, God, s... something's wrong.

08:18.281 --> 08:19.956
- Rebecca, what?
- I don't know. Something's happening.

08:20.327 --> 08:22.857
- Okay, just sit still. I'll call 911.
- Okay.

08:25.885 --> 08:26.838
Oh, God.

08:35.567 --> 08:37.356
Do you want to try to
drink a little more of this?

08:37.616 --> 08:38.707
No, thank you. I'm not thirsty.

08:38.707 --> 08:40.666
Well, they really want you
to drink as much as you can.

08:40.666 --> 08:42.337
- I'm really not thirsty.
- Okay.

08:45.402 --> 08:46.561
Can we go yet?

08:47.157 --> 08:48.701
Well, the doctor wants
to keep his eye on you, 

08:48.868 --> 08:49.757
just for a little while.

08:50.668 --> 08:51.561
I don't want to be here.

08:53.927 --> 08:54.716
I know.

08:55.997 --> 08:56.553
I know.

08:59.500 --> 09:04.198
I r... I remember when I was on my
second or third date with William, 

09:04.680 --> 09:06.789
and I didn't really know him very well, 

09:06.953 --> 09:08.384
but he took me to this seafood restaurant

09:08.618 --> 09:10.618
where I got massive food poisoning.

09:10.800 --> 09:11.783
Thought I was gonna die.

09:14.133 --> 09:15.628
I was reading "Valley of the dolls"

09:15.754 --> 09:17.491
at that time, and I
had a copy in my purse.

09:18.524 --> 09:20.544
He stayed with me there
all night, read to me.

09:20.699 --> 09:24.760
Every 30 seconds I stuck my head
in a bucket and puked my guts out.

09:26.198 --> 09:28.908
- Yeah, I wouldn't return his call for weeks.
- Why?

09:29.163 --> 09:32.678
I was mortified. I didn't
want him to see me like that.

09:33.204 --> 09:35.986
And now, not only was I the
girl with her head in the bucket, 

09:36.167 --> 09:38.555
but he found out I was
reading "Valley of the dolls."

09:42.771 --> 09:43.844
But the... the truth of the matter is, 

09:44.106 --> 09:47.569
he liked taking cared of me, 
and I liked that he liked it.

09:51.420 --> 09:53.607
Okay. I'll have a sip of water.

09:54.064 --> 09:55.118
Good.

09:58.979 --> 09:59.923
You want to talk about it?

10:02.729 --> 10:04.378
- No.
- Okay.

10:05.684 --> 10:08.736
But thank you for... for being there

10:09.066 --> 10:10.491
and calling my mom and Justin.

10:12.728 --> 10:14.803
Can you not tell anybody
until Justin gets here?

10:14.989 --> 10:18.985
- I won't tell anyone.
- I came as fast as I could. You okay?

10:19.239 --> 10:20.335
I lost the baby.

10:21.604 --> 10:23.487
Oh, sweetie. I'm sorry.

10:27.467 --> 10:29.483
Listen, I'm gonna wait outside, 
give you guys some time.

10:29.593 --> 10:30.512
Thank you.

10:32.734 --> 10:34.160
Oh, sweetheart.

10:40.198 --> 10:43.454
Well, obviously we need to
review... thank you... my platform.

10:43.660 --> 10:44.997
Platforms are for olympic divers.

10:45.218 --> 10:46.434
We need to already be swimming.

10:46.580 --> 10:48.483
Hey, can I just cut to the chase

10:48.617 --> 10:50.439
and let's eighty-six
this little audition?

10:50.594 --> 10:52.961
No. I'm sorry, Buffy, 
but this is an interview, 

10:53.108 --> 10:54.546
and frankly, it's not going very well.

10:54.712 --> 10:56.213
Come on. I already have the job.

10:56.398 --> 10:59.421
- I'm pretty sure that's up to me.
- Well, you waited too long.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.791
What do you mean, I waited too long?

11:00.927 --> 11:03.558
Sweetheart, you think you're
announcin' from city hall?

11:04.364 --> 11:05.012
I am. No.

11:08.594 --> 11:09.770
That building is gonna be swarming

11:10.174 --> 11:13.110
with SUVs three-deep, 
loaded with security.

11:13.557 --> 11:16.244
A staffer will probably be
calling you in the next half-hour.

11:16.429 --> 11:17.259
How did you know that?

11:17.390 --> 11:20.693
I am obsessed with these things.
I have sources everywhere.

11:20.949 --> 11:22.225
Anyway, you can do better.

11:22.335 --> 11:25.957
You have the perfect spot.
It's just hiding in plain sight.

11:26.168 --> 11:29.486
- What are you talking about?
- Hon, your choice of venue

11:29.579 --> 11:32.513
is really a decision best
left to your campaign manager.

11:32.686 --> 11:34.022
Oh, come on, Buffy. You know what?

11:34.206 --> 11:35.973
Blackmail is not a good color on you.

11:36.224 --> 11:37.915
Well, just tell me I have the job.

11:38.049 --> 11:39.750
Prove to me you deserve it.

11:40.388 --> 11:42.206
You're a moderate Republican

11:42.362 --> 11:45.557
running on family values
and small business.

11:45.748 --> 11:46.315
Ojai Foods.

11:46.488 --> 11:48.744
- Bingo. - Mm-hmm. I was already
thinking about it, and, you know, 

11:48.849 --> 11:50.126
they can't say no, 
because they're my family.

11:50.256 --> 11:51.716
Standard vetting will need to be done.

11:51.839 --> 11:53.438
Of course. But I... I
think most of the skeletons

11:53.575 --> 11:55.787
in that particular closet
have already been found.

11:55.933 --> 11:59.378
Speaking of skeletons, is there
anything you need to tell me?

11:59.507 --> 12:00.886
No. No, you can start digging.

12:01.062 --> 12:04.482
Okay. Well, your hair is
growing in beautifully.

12:04.598 --> 12:05.505
- Oh.
- Thank you.

12:05.678 --> 12:09.226
Yes. And you feel comfortable
releasing your medical records?

12:09.356 --> 12:10.178
- I do. I feel good.
- Okay.

12:10.265 --> 12:14.816
- I'm... I'm in remission.
- Good. Okay. Nothin' else I need to know?

12:14.932 --> 12:18.543
- Nothing else you need to know.
- So do I deserve it?

12:18.684 --> 12:22.167
No. But clearly, you have the job anyway.

12:24.343 --> 12:26.368
Did you know they have
bacon chocolate here?

12:26.551 --> 12:28.192
Oh, yeah. It's not just
for breakfast anymore.

12:28.328 --> 12:29.767
Would you like to try anything else?

12:30.242 --> 12:32.597
Uh, I don't know. Kevin, do
I want to try anything else?

12:32.769 --> 12:34.527
Oh, yeah. Definitely do the wasabi next.

12:34.617 --> 12:36.407
No. I draw the line at horseradish.

12:36.661 --> 12:38.536
Okay. Uh, how about the lavender?

12:38.667 --> 12:39.702
Scotty always wants to try that.

12:39.790 --> 12:41.334
Well, if Scotty wants to try the lavender, 

12:41.421 --> 12:43.386
you can tell Scotty to come
down here and taste it himself.

12:43.516 --> 12:44.917
Ouch. Snark much recently?

12:45.097 --> 12:46.216
Sorry. God, I just...

12:46.395 --> 12:48.546
I don't know why you
sent me to this place.

12:48.652 --> 12:52.530
I just... I don't really need
fancy, artisanal chocolate.

12:52.744 --> 12:54.366
Look, you have all day
to figure this out, okay?

12:54.753 --> 12:57.330
I'm at work. I should go. Oh!
Uh, the... the chili pepper.

12:57.442 --> 12:59.242
- That's meant to be an aphrodisiac. Get him that.
- Okay.

13:00.310 --> 13:02.180
But what if... he doesn't get me anything

13:02.327 --> 13:04.166
and I show up with... with a box

13:04.312 --> 13:07.987
of chili pepper or lavender
or lox-infused chocolate?

13:08.140 --> 13:09.723
They don't do lox. And he's
gonna get you something.

13:09.844 --> 13:12.534
Hold on. Yeah? What's his name?

13:13.882 --> 13:15.781
All right. Let him up, 
I guess. I have to go.

13:16.021 --> 13:17.412
Wait. I don't know what to get.

13:21.943 --> 13:23.637
You know, nothing says "I
love you" like sweethearts.

13:27.373 --> 13:27.957
Hey.

13:28.139 --> 13:29.835
There's someone here to see
you. He thinks it's important.

13:30.558 --> 13:31.694
It's a Saturday. Who is it?

13:31.828 --> 13:33.479
His name's Alec Tyler, says he knows you.

13:34.900 --> 13:35.995
- Send him in.
- Sure.

13:36.730 --> 13:37.467
You can come in.

13:45.868 --> 13:48.842
Uh, Kevin, I think we're gonna
need to... speak privately.

13:51.445 --> 13:52.675
Sure.

13:56.213 --> 14:01.163
I'm probably the last person
you expected or wanted to see.

14:02.055 --> 14:03.504
Mm. Actually, I don't consider you at all.

14:06.257 --> 14:07.490
I just need a minute of your time.

14:07.800 --> 14:08.722
Why should I talk to you?

14:09.856 --> 14:11.161
You tried to steal my wife last year.

14:12.311 --> 14:14.407
Because I've been approached
about my relationship with Kitty.

14:16.892 --> 14:18.911
Oh. Okay, come on, 
Paigey. We're running late.

14:19.109 --> 14:21.349
- Mom, have you seen my goggles?
- I got 'em.

14:21.853 --> 14:22.536
Thanks.

14:25.993 --> 14:26.500
What?

14:26.655 --> 14:29.784
- Paige, do you have a Valentine?
- You talked to uncle Kevin.

14:29.958 --> 14:31.891
- Mm-hmm. - It's
nothing, really. Just...

14:32.857 --> 14:34.520
There was a lot of
hurt feelings last year, 

14:34.740 --> 14:36.492
so Mrs. Nowicki wanted to be fair, 

14:36.815 --> 14:39.099
and she put all of the
boys' names into a hat

14:39.261 --> 14:40.468
and had the girls choose one.

14:41.059 --> 14:43.471
Oh. Well, that's a nice way to do it.

14:43.666 --> 14:45.818
We're also learning about
India for social studies, 

14:45.999 --> 14:49.351
so she thought it'd be a good
lesson in arranged marriages.

14:50.099 --> 14:50.997
Do you like who you got?

14:51.987 --> 14:52.864
Andrew Whitlow?

14:53.962 --> 14:54.636
He's okay.

14:54.802 --> 14:57.099
- Just okay?
- Well, there's this other boy.

14:57.255 --> 14:59.744
- Oh. There always is, honey.
- Jake Gannon.

15:00.030 --> 15:02.165
Oh. Sometimes when the teacher's talking

15:02.379 --> 15:04.482
and writing on the board, 
he'll go like this...

15:06.510 --> 15:08.480
He's really funny and so cute.

15:09.353 --> 15:12.775
But if I'd gotten Jake? Nightmare.

15:12.928 --> 15:13.994
- Why?
- Because I like him, 

15:14.217 --> 15:16.797
and my cheeks probably
would have turned pink, 

15:16.970 --> 15:18.603
and I might have even barfed.

15:18.804 --> 15:21.052
And he'd probably throw my
Valentine's in the trash.

15:21.313 --> 15:23.132
At least Andrew will say thank you.

15:23.349 --> 15:25.529
Well, there's a lot to be said
for a boy who says thank you.

15:25.900 --> 15:28.109
And as you grow up, 
Paige, you will realize

15:28.248 --> 15:30.157
that the man who makes
you barf and blush...

15:31.015 --> 15:32.112
That's not Mr. Perfect.

15:33.386 --> 15:34.023
No.

15:34.681 --> 15:39.007
No, there's a lot to be
said for a nice thank you.

15:45.468 --> 15:46.225
Hey.

15:47.362 --> 15:49.259
The doctor's looking at her.

15:52.348 --> 15:53.993
- She'll be okay.
- Oh, yeah. She'll be fine.

15:54.160 --> 15:55.804
I'm not sure it's hit her yet, but...

15:56.508 --> 15:57.237
No.

15:57.817 --> 16:00.347
Holly, can I get you something?
A cup of coffee maybe?

16:00.506 --> 16:02.353
Oh, please, Nora. No, 
you've done enough already.

16:03.132 --> 16:06.100
You were there when she needed
you. That's what really matters.

16:07.919 --> 16:08.563
I love Rebecca.

16:12.079 --> 16:13.050
Nora, I, um...

16:16.205 --> 16:18.429
You know, our life... you and I...

16:19.320 --> 16:20.792
it's never been easy.

16:21.068 --> 16:22.635
It'll probably never be easy.

16:24.949 --> 16:25.615
I may not...

16:26.270 --> 16:28.304
Have the chance to say this again.

16:31.078 --> 16:35.372
I wanted to thank you, 
sincerely, for today.

16:36.863 --> 16:39.747
I... it... it was nothing. We're family.

16:40.632 --> 16:41.763
Boy, I never thought I'd say that, 

16:41.901 --> 16:44.172
but we are family now, you and I.

16:44.365 --> 16:46.995
And that's what families
do. We support each other.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.066
I don't know what to say.

16:51.805 --> 16:52.751
Um...

16:53.094 --> 16:54.916
Well, don't say anything. Here he is.

16:55.578 --> 16:58.271
- Where is she? - Hi, 
honey. Um, it's room 2- 4- 3.

16:58.453 --> 16:59.905
- Down the hall. Okay.
- You guys okay?

17:00.051 --> 17:01.051
Yeah. We're fine. Go... go talk to her.

17:03.483 --> 17:05.858
Okay. Holly, at... at least
let me call Sarah for you

17:06.127 --> 17:07.617
and... and tell her that you and Rebecca

17:08.067 --> 17:10.127
- won't be in to work on Monday.
- What?

17:10.483 --> 17:12.807
Well, the last thing you want
to think about now is Ojai Foods.

17:14.704 --> 17:16.637
No, that's me. That's me.

17:20.688 --> 17:21.910
Oh, it's Kevin.

17:22.384 --> 17:24.037
- I'm gonna talk to him.
- Sure.

17:24.902 --> 17:27.088
Hi, honey. I'm glad you called.

17:32.689 --> 17:35.443
So you're telling me that
someone left you a voice mail.

17:35.708 --> 17:37.917
Yes. They said that they wanted to talk

17:38.062 --> 17:40.684
- about my relationship with Kitty.
- And you didn't return the call?

17:40.986 --> 17:43.230
- No.
- You know what? I don't believe you.

17:44.834 --> 17:45.346
Okay, listen.

17:45.710 --> 17:46.590
I want you to tell me what you want.

17:47.787 --> 17:49.659
Is this about the press?
Are you writing a tell-all?

17:49.923 --> 17:50.894
Or is this just about the money?

17:51.594 --> 17:52.178
I don't want money.

17:53.523 --> 17:55.247
I am here for one reason... to warn you.

17:55.506 --> 17:57.081
You're a senator. I figure
whoever is behind this

17:57.281 --> 17:59.339
is... is trying to sabotage
your political career.

17:59.601 --> 18:00.783
Why would you give a damn about my career?

18:00.982 --> 18:03.523
I don't, but Kitty does.

18:08.461 --> 18:11.258
You know that Kitty is
gonna be running for my seat?

18:12.814 --> 18:13.747
She's about to announce.

18:15.871 --> 18:17.237
Wow. Good for her.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.855
It's a little early for a smear campaign, 

18:20.791 --> 18:23.968
so whoever is behind this
is a... ahead of the curve.

18:24.174 --> 18:25.272
Who would have it out for Kitty?

18:25.447 --> 18:27.597
I don't know yet. Here's
what I want you to do.

18:27.736 --> 18:29.109
I want you to call them
and set up a meeting.

18:29.259 --> 18:30.382
Give them 24 hours.

18:31.528 --> 18:33.418
You and I are gonna get to
the bottom of this. Okay.

18:38.339 --> 18:39.211
Hey.

18:42.352 --> 18:43.661
Did you sleep with my wife?

18:46.009 --> 18:47.078
No.

18:50.087 --> 18:51.437
Call me when you hear from them.

18:53.634 --> 18:54.995
Okay.

18:59.944 --> 19:01.891
So I've ordered six dedicated phone lines.

19:02.219 --> 19:04.517
- They will be set up on Monday.
- Only six?

19:04.984 --> 19:06.026
Until we find you a proper office, 

19:06.229 --> 19:07.307
this is campaign central, 

19:07.496 --> 19:10.784
- and your kitchen phone ain't cuttin' it.
- Okay. What's this?

19:10.962 --> 19:14.779
These are of staffers, foot
soldiers, speechwriters...

19:15.002 --> 19:16.971
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Short
list. I have a short list.

19:17.145 --> 19:18.532
Here it is. Right here in the blue folder.

19:18.688 --> 19:20.366
Okay. I'll take a look at that

19:20.517 --> 19:22.641
as soon as I'm done with
my Ojai Foods research.

19:23.032 --> 19:25.455
Did you know... that your father's company

19:25.629 --> 19:27.886
has employed over 3, 000
people since it opened?

19:28.069 --> 19:29.282
Did you find any red flags?

19:29.478 --> 19:33.003
Just another financially-strapped
small business.

19:33.474 --> 19:34.046
It's perfect.

19:34.474 --> 19:37.090
Oh, my God. Oh, my
God, you are so cynical.

19:37.607 --> 19:39.503
Well, you need to get used to that.

19:39.790 --> 19:41.096
As a matter of fact, we need to talk about

19:41.194 --> 19:43.420
who's gonna be onstage
for the announcement.

19:43.554 --> 19:44.808
Well, that would be my family.

19:45.067 --> 19:47.823
I have done a background
check on Scotty Wandell, 

19:47.972 --> 19:51.558
and apparently, he's had
some citations for vagrancy, 

19:51.772 --> 19:53.219
something about sleeping in his car.

19:53.828 --> 19:56.454
Yes, and he's also my brother's husband.

19:56.658 --> 19:58.468
Isn't that the point you're
actually trying to make?

19:58.697 --> 20:01.146
Well, I'm not sayin' we have
to keep him in the closet

20:01.354 --> 20:02.344
during the whole campaign.

20:02.499 --> 20:04.759
I'm just saying we don't
need to trot him out

20:04.932 --> 20:05.645
during the announcement.

20:05.963 --> 20:09.115
- He can be in the audience.
- How do you sleep at night?

20:09.278 --> 20:10.311
Like a baby.

20:10.528 --> 20:11.512
Now let's talk about your husband.

20:11.723 --> 20:14.145
What, y... you want to
put him in the closet, too?

20:14.802 --> 20:18.387
No. I want him to stand way in the back.

20:18.916 --> 20:20.641
He can hold your beautiful baby.

20:20.874 --> 20:22.465
You're gonna put my baby in the back?

20:23.204 --> 20:24.684
Okay, your mama can hold the baby.

20:24.863 --> 20:26.910
I'm just sayin', I don't
want any distractions

20:27.247 --> 20:29.227
from the main event, which is you.

20:30.297 --> 20:31.488
Let's put your sister up there.

20:32.197 --> 20:34.144
We can put your war vet brother up there

20:34.595 --> 20:37.900
- or your kindly uncle Saul.
- Uh, no. Saul is gay.

20:38.186 --> 20:41.368
Oh, shoot. I should have
known it when I saw his socks.

20:42.914 --> 20:43.881
You know, here's the thing...

20:44.030 --> 20:46.006
The... the... the reason
that we're doing it at Ojai

20:46.167 --> 20:47.709
is because it's a family business.

20:47.840 --> 20:49.819
Yes. That's the beauty of Ojai.

20:50.407 --> 20:52.894
It's symbolic of family.

21:00.085 --> 21:02.987
Hey, Sarah. You'll be very happy
to know that you made the cut.

21:03.244 --> 21:07.133
Well, no. I mean that you
get to stand onstage with me

21:07.280 --> 21:08.200
during my announcement.

21:11.873 --> 21:12.584
Oh, no.

21:14.313 --> 21:15.449
Oh, no. You're kidding me.

21:17.585 --> 21:19.538
Oh, God. Poor Rebecca.

21:20.353 --> 21:21.286
Is she okay?

21:22.395 --> 21:23.566
Wait. No, no. Of course. Of course.

21:23.694 --> 21:25.868
I will be there as...
as soon as I can. Yeah.

21:27.670 --> 21:29.352
Uh, Buffy, I'm really
sorry, but I have to go.

21:29.692 --> 21:31.178
Okay, Evan is Fed.

21:31.417 --> 21:33.661
Evan is with the nanny. I'll... just...

21:34.747 --> 21:36.963
Oh, wait a second. I
need to ask you somethin'.

21:37.202 --> 21:40.093
No, sorry. I don't have time
to answer any more questions.

21:40.395 --> 21:41.522
Who is Holly Harper?

21:41.679 --> 21:43.755
No, I am not gonna vet
another person in my life.

21:43.925 --> 21:46.018
- I'm sorry. I don't have time.
- Listen. According to this, 

21:46.276 --> 21:49.454
Holly Harper has sold all
her shares of Ojai Foods.

21:50.971 --> 21:52.987
So you need to call your sister

21:53.120 --> 21:54.503
and find out who owns this company

21:54.627 --> 21:55.772
before you announce from there.

21:58.877 --> 21:59.913
What are you thinking?

22:02.188 --> 22:02.900
Nothing.

22:06.147 --> 22:06.877
I just...

22:08.357 --> 22:09.315
feel empty.

22:12.853 --> 22:14.137
Well, the doctor said
you're gonna be okay.

22:14.654 --> 22:15.301
"Okay"?

22:18.327 --> 22:19.413
What, like, "try again"?

22:24.018 --> 22:24.884
Uh, yeah.

22:25.185 --> 22:26.800
Yeah. You know, when we're ready.

22:28.223 --> 22:29.313
We weren't ready this time.

22:33.234 --> 22:35.257
Look, Rebecca, we... we
don't have to talk about that.

22:36.750 --> 22:40.025
All right? As... as long as
we have each other, I'm happy.

22:46.617 --> 22:48.335
Could we just turn on the tv?

23:00.587 --> 23:02.102
Look, Rebecca, you have to let me in.

23:04.056 --> 23:06.554
Okay, cry, punch a wall, 
punch me, something...

23:06.804 --> 23:07.831
But just let me help you.

23:10.965 --> 23:12.182
I just want to go home.

23:15.750 --> 23:17.639
I want to forget this ever happened.

23:21.682 --> 23:23.247
Okay.

23:36.643 --> 23:38.444
Nothing Holly does surprises me.

23:38.444 --> 23:39.984
Is she in there with Rebecca?

23:39.984 --> 23:42.548
No, no, she left pretty
much as soon as I got here.

23:42.548 --> 23:44.075
She said it was important.

23:44.109 --> 23:46.179
More important than her daughter, I guess.

23:46.179 --> 23:47.042
Kevin, don't say that.

23:47.075 --> 23:48.731
All right? She's Rebecca's mother.

23:48.732 --> 23:50.242
- Just...
- Okay, okay, okay. Stop.

23:50.276 --> 23:52.543
You don't have to worry
about it right now.

23:52.576 --> 23:55.075
It's just so hard to watch her suffer.

23:55.109 --> 23:58.409
I feel like there's nothing I can do.

23:59.647 --> 24:00.626
Yeah.

24:02.142 --> 24:05.109
Yeah, you know, I remember
when it happened to me.

24:05.142 --> 24:08.676
It... I didn't even know what to think.

24:08.709 --> 24:11.276
And... and everybody
wanted to talk about it, 

24:11.309 --> 24:13.042
and it just...

24:13.075 --> 24:15.365
It just seems impossible.

24:17.203 --> 24:19.209
You know, I was at the
bookstore at school today, 

24:19.242 --> 24:21.543
and, um, 

24:21.576 --> 24:23.576
I noticed they had a kids' section.

24:25.276 --> 24:27.442
"My fuzzy Valentine."

24:29.209 --> 24:31.423
I was gonna give it to
her for Valentine's day, 

24:31.423 --> 24:32.439
but, um, 

24:34.609 --> 24:37.586
you know, you should, uh, you
should just give it to Evan.

24:37.586 --> 24:39.430
He'll think it's cool, right?

24:39.714 --> 24:41.454
Oh, Justin.

24:43.765 --> 24:45.432
I'm sorry.

24:45.465 --> 24:47.198
You know what I'm gonna do?

24:47.231 --> 24:50.598
I'm gonna keep this
until you want it back.

24:53.931 --> 24:56.698
It's okay.

24:56.732 --> 24:58.598
It's okay. I'm sorry.

24:59.865 --> 25:01.336
I've brought everybody up to speed.

25:01.336 --> 25:03.397
- I don't know what else to do.
- I was just with her.

25:03.397 --> 25:06.057
We sat there together with
our children down the hall.

25:06.057 --> 25:08.492
She looked me in the face
and she never said anything.

25:08.492 --> 25:10.238
Kitty just faxed over what
she found. Take a look.

25:10.272 --> 25:12.971
Okay, please tell me Holly
did not sell all her shares.

25:12.971 --> 25:14.478
She sold all her shares.

25:14.478 --> 25:16.778
Even if she did, we have the majority.

25:16.778 --> 25:18.943
No, this obstfeld capital group

25:18.943 --> 25:21.400
is obviously confident of
gaining a majority share

25:21.400 --> 25:22.927
or they wouldn't have made her the offer.

25:22.927 --> 25:24.194
She sold it to a conglomerate, 

25:24.227 --> 25:26.728
behind our back, in
the middle of the night?

25:26.761 --> 25:27.880
How could she do this?

25:27.881 --> 25:30.528
Because Holly has no pride
of ownership, that's how.

25:30.561 --> 25:32.914
I wish dad had figured that out
before he screwed her and left...

25:32.914 --> 25:35.654
Come on, Sarah. Stop dredging
up the past. It's enough...

25:35.654 --> 25:38.409
I am sick of cleaning up dad's messes.

25:38.409 --> 25:40.375
I can't believe this is still going on.

25:40.409 --> 25:41.874
No matter what your
father might have done, 

25:41.874 --> 25:43.552
it doesn't matter. It's
not his company anymore.

25:43.552 --> 25:46.351
It's ours, most especially
yours and Saul's.

25:46.351 --> 25:48.125
You've poured your heart into it.

25:48.125 --> 25:50.833
Everything of value here
exists because of you.

25:50.833 --> 25:52.924
And I swear to God, I'll
see the whole place blown up

25:52.958 --> 25:55.968
before I see some faceless
conglomerate take it over.

25:55.968 --> 25:58.158
Right. And I'm not ready
to give up either, so...

25:58.191 --> 26:00.791
How do you suggest we stop it?

26:00.824 --> 26:03.325
With a big brick wall
called the Walker family.

26:05.340 --> 26:06.873
I'll call Holly, 

26:06.873 --> 26:10.454
see if I can find out who
this obstfeld group is.

26:10.454 --> 26:12.976
No. I want to talk to Holly.

26:23.574 --> 26:24.795
So...

26:26.417 --> 26:28.261
How is she?

26:28.261 --> 26:30.547
The... cancer.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.514
I... I... I heard about it on tv.

26:33.307 --> 26:36.274
She is better and better every day.

26:36.307 --> 26:39.074
I'm glad to hear it.

26:41.174 --> 26:44.140
I lost my wife to breast cancer.

26:44.174 --> 26:46.940
How far along was she when you found out?

26:46.973 --> 26:48.441
Stage III.

26:48.474 --> 26:51.441
Um, and, you know, we...
we tried everything, 

26:51.474 --> 26:54.807
but, uh, it had spread too far.

26:54.840 --> 26:56.940
I'm sorry.

27:03.340 --> 27:06.307
You know, Kitty and I
were not in a good place, 

27:06.340 --> 27:09.174
even before she started
taking Evan to the park.

27:09.207 --> 27:11.773
I'd had a heart attack.

27:11.807 --> 27:13.773
I... withdrew.

27:13.807 --> 27:16.207
I shut her out, and so...

27:16.240 --> 27:17.314
Because of that, 

27:17.314 --> 27:18.733
we've had to fight for
everything that we have, 

27:18.733 --> 27:22.699
and today we're better off
than we've ever been, so...

27:23.307 --> 27:26.739
I guess I should thank you.

27:31.897 --> 27:32.841
What should I do?

27:32.841 --> 27:34.360
Answer it. Okay.

27:42.089 --> 27:44.140
- Hello.
- Um, is there a place

27:44.140 --> 27:46.806
where we could sit
down and maybe have a...

27:49.873 --> 27:53.960
- Well, this is awkward, isn't it?
- That's putting it mildly.

27:53.960 --> 27:54.725
You two know each other?

27:54.725 --> 27:56.981
I'm afraid we do. Alec, this is Buffy, 

27:57.015 --> 27:59.247
Kitty's college chum
turned campaign manager.

27:59.281 --> 28:00.748
Buffy, this is Alec, 

28:00.781 --> 28:04.648
the man who did not have
an affair with my wife.

28:04.681 --> 28:06.648
Alec, thank you for coming forward.

28:06.681 --> 28:07.449
You're a stand-up guy.

28:07.449 --> 28:10.768
Hey, I was investigating
a potential problem.

28:10.768 --> 28:13.391
An affair in the Republican
party is a killer.

28:13.391 --> 28:15.991
This was just a very sensitive issue.

28:16.024 --> 28:18.824
I was being thorough.

28:18.857 --> 28:21.757
You weren't being thorough.
You were being disrespectful.

28:21.790 --> 28:23.558
Excuse me.

28:27.957 --> 28:30.424
Oh, my God.

28:30.458 --> 28:32.458
Roy, I...

28:32.491 --> 28:35.458
I can't believe you got this for me.

28:35.491 --> 28:37.466
Well, I had this whole
roller skating plan.

28:37.466 --> 28:38.336
Roller skating?

28:38.336 --> 28:40.336
Yeah, uh, but then I
talked to your brother.

28:40.369 --> 28:42.835
- He, uh, he told me about the accident.
- Oh.

28:42.869 --> 28:44.969
Anyway, I wanted to do something better, 

28:45.002 --> 28:46.969
and so I went back to the gallery.

28:47.002 --> 28:49.602
Roy, i... it... it... it's so extravagant.

28:50.914 --> 28:52.007
I know.

28:52.007 --> 28:54.473
I got it back to the house, 

28:54.506 --> 28:57.473
and I started thinking, 
maybe I was trying too hard.

28:57.506 --> 29:00.207
I... I don't really
even like the painting.

29:02.007 --> 29:03.843
We don't like the same things, Sarah.

29:03.843 --> 29:05.709
No, we...

29:08.134 --> 29:12.568
It shouldn't be this hard, should it?

29:12.601 --> 29:14.568
What are you saying, Roy?

29:14.601 --> 29:19.067
I don't think this is working out.

29:19.100 --> 29:21.901
Are you breaking up with me?

29:21.935 --> 29:23.467
Yes.

29:23.501 --> 29:26.146
- I like you, Sarah.
- You like me.

29:26.146 --> 29:27.809
I really do. I... God, I...
oh, my God. I bought you...

29:27.809 --> 29:31.055
I bought you chocolates...
chili pepper chocolates.

29:31.055 --> 29:32.575
Chili pepper chocolates?

29:32.576 --> 29:34.778
They're an aphrodisiac.
I can't believe it.

29:34.778 --> 29:37.245
I got sucked into this
whole Valentine's day thing, 

29:37.278 --> 29:37.784
and I knew...

29:37.784 --> 29:41.313
I had a feeling deep down
that things weren't wonderful, 

29:41.313 --> 29:42.899
but I... I was...

29:42.899 --> 29:46.105
- Trying.
- Yes, trying. I've been trying.

29:47.088 --> 29:49.122
Like me.

29:53.154 --> 29:54.609
You're right.

29:55.989 --> 29:58.956
I am so sorry. You're right.

29:58.989 --> 30:02.489
I've been trying to get
my heart to follow my head.

30:02.522 --> 30:04.989
Yeah.

30:05.022 --> 30:08.789
Obviously, I really want us to be friends.

30:08.822 --> 30:10.622
Oh, me, too.

30:10.655 --> 30:12.622
We can do that tomorrow.

30:12.655 --> 30:14.455
Sure. Yeah.

30:14.489 --> 30:18.288
Well, obviously, I can't
accept this painting.

30:18.322 --> 30:19.956
Yeah... no. Yes, please.

30:19.989 --> 30:21.847
This is not my painting anymore.

30:21.847 --> 30:23.813
I want you to have it.

30:23.847 --> 30:26.813
You love it. Please keep it. Please?

30:28.175 --> 30:29.629
Thanks.

30:34.502 --> 30:37.070
How can you go on a
fishing expedition like that

30:37.103 --> 30:39.703
- without coming to her first?
- I was gathering facts.

30:39.736 --> 30:41.436
And when exactly did you
first hear about this?

30:41.437 --> 30:42.703
When you were runnin' for governor, 

30:42.736 --> 30:44.766
someone noticed Kitty
and Alec at the park.

30:44.766 --> 30:45.854
With our children.

30:45.854 --> 30:48.821
- I'm sorry. I should've just asked you.
- You know what?

30:48.854 --> 30:50.412
If you can't communicate
any better than that, 

30:50.412 --> 30:52.082
then she shouldn't be working for you.

30:52.082 --> 30:53.936
Maybe you and I should
have this discussion alone.

30:53.937 --> 30:56.023
You know what? The blonde hair

30:56.023 --> 30:58.177
and the southern drawl don't distract me.

30:58.177 --> 31:00.097
I've run for this office, 
and I've won it twice.

31:00.098 --> 31:01.831
Yes, but you're not the
candidate this time, Robert.

31:01.831 --> 31:03.937
I am. And, Buffy, I've done your job.

31:03.938 --> 31:05.477
- I know how hard it is.
- Thank you.

31:05.511 --> 31:07.636
But there is a fine line
between doing what's right

31:07.636 --> 31:09.736
and doing what's right for your candidate.

31:09.769 --> 31:12.103
And you need to come
to me first next time, 

31:12.136 --> 31:13.191
because if we can't trust each other, 

31:13.191 --> 31:16.103
- then we can't work together.
- W... wait a minute.

31:16.136 --> 31:17.744
You're... you're keeping her on
the payroll after what she's...

31:17.744 --> 31:19.407
Robert, I appreciate
your opinion, but, yes, 

31:19.407 --> 31:22.941
I need Buffy. And I hate
to tell you this, Buffy, 

31:22.974 --> 31:25.617
- but you're gonna be working all night.
- What am I missin'?

31:25.617 --> 31:28.953
Well, I have found a
venue for my announcement.

31:28.953 --> 31:30.870
Okay. Someone want to clue me in?

31:30.870 --> 31:32.837
As you know, I'm running on family values, 

31:32.870 --> 31:36.287
so I've decided to do it
here, where I learned them.

31:37.277 --> 31:38.957
And we're gonna do it tomorrow.

31:38.957 --> 31:40.810
Tomorrow?

31:40.810 --> 31:44.710
Announcing on a Sunday is a
nightmare for the news cycle.

31:44.743 --> 31:48.043
What part of "make it
happen" do you not understand?

31:50.643 --> 31:52.609
Not a thing.

31:52.643 --> 31:54.410
Well, excuse me.

31:54.444 --> 31:56.943
I have some phone calls to make.

32:00.344 --> 32:01.312
She's so out of touch, 

32:01.312 --> 32:03.469
she doesn't even see the
genius of doing it on Sunday...

32:03.469 --> 32:05.017
Valentine's day.

32:05.811 --> 32:07.811
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

32:07.844 --> 32:11.245
I thought it was our sex-iversary.

32:11.278 --> 32:14.245
You should put that
on a banner behind you.

32:14.278 --> 32:16.744
It'd be more famous than "I Like Ike."

32:18.778 --> 32:21.011
Sex-iversary.

32:26.678 --> 32:29.644
Well, I never thought
I would find you here.

32:29.678 --> 32:31.644
Hello, Nora.

32:31.678 --> 32:35.211
What, are you packing up your office?

32:35.245 --> 32:38.211
Four years ago, Holly, 
you became a reality to me, 

32:38.245 --> 32:40.178
and while I never imagined a world

32:40.178 --> 32:41.464
in which my husband's mistress

32:41.464 --> 32:43.742
would become a daily
part of it, I accepted it.

32:43.742 --> 32:46.075
I fought it, I didn't
like it, but I accepted it.

32:46.109 --> 32:47.380
I accepted you.

32:47.380 --> 32:49.680
We've shared experiences, life...

32:49.714 --> 32:51.558
We almost shared a grandchild together, 

32:51.558 --> 32:54.524
and today of all days, 
when I looked you in the eye

32:54.558 --> 32:55.928
and we mourned the loss of that, 

32:55.929 --> 32:57.208
the joining of our two families, 

32:57.208 --> 32:58.307
you never bothered to tell me

32:58.308 --> 33:01.556
- how you had betrayed mine.
- Nora, please let me explain.

33:01.556 --> 33:04.556
God, when I think of all the
precious moments of my life

33:04.589 --> 33:07.289
I have wasted trying to
swallow my fury at you...

33:07.322 --> 33:09.289
I was in a very difficult situation.

33:09.322 --> 33:11.989
Oh, really? Is this
about your money troubles?

33:12.023 --> 33:14.772
Good God. William left you more money

33:14.772 --> 33:16.973
than most people could dream about, 

33:17.006 --> 33:19.639
and when you lost that, 
you sold his legacy

33:19.672 --> 33:21.806
and slithered away for your own profit.

33:21.839 --> 33:23.163
It's always about money with you, Holly.

33:23.163 --> 33:24.930
No, no. It's about survival.

33:24.930 --> 33:27.664
Well, congratulations! You
made it through another day.

33:27.698 --> 33:30.364
I canceled the deal.

33:30.398 --> 33:32.865
I didn't sell my shares.

33:32.897 --> 33:35.231
I read it in black and white.

33:35.264 --> 33:36.765
It never happened.

33:36.798 --> 33:40.498
What you read was a
pending sale. I stopped it.

33:40.531 --> 33:44.097
You couldn't have told me
that when I walked in here?

33:44.131 --> 33:48.097
This afternoon in the hospital...

33:48.131 --> 33:53.097
when you said that I was family, 

33:53.131 --> 33:57.698
I realized that no money
was worth losing that.

33:57.731 --> 34:01.264
Has anyone ever told
you you're exhausting?

34:02.798 --> 34:04.897
There's one more thing...

34:04.930 --> 34:06.930
Oh, God. Now what?

34:06.964 --> 34:09.097
This man that wants to buy my shares...

34:09.130 --> 34:11.143
- I'm telling you, he's trouble.
- Why?

34:11.143 --> 34:14.315
He knows something about
the value of this company

34:14.315 --> 34:16.146
that was gonna make him very rich.

34:16.146 --> 34:18.504
I have tried everything to
figure out what that was.

34:18.505 --> 34:19.301
That doesn't make any sense.

34:19.301 --> 34:21.036
How could he know something
about Ojai that we don't?

34:21.036 --> 34:23.254
He knew William. They
were business partners.

34:23.254 --> 34:26.187
His name is Dennis York.

34:29.290 --> 34:31.360
Well, that changes everything.

34:35.413 --> 34:37.380
Hello?

34:37.413 --> 34:38.924
Oh, my God. You're early.

34:38.924 --> 34:40.702
No, I'm not early. I
said I'd be home by 8:00.

34:40.703 --> 34:41.824
I must've lost track of time.

34:41.858 --> 34:44.025
I'm... I... I was gonna surprise
you with your mom's brownies.

34:44.058 --> 34:44.945
Well, why are you doing that?

34:44.945 --> 34:46.873
Your mom said that they're your favorite.

34:46.873 --> 34:48.900
- No, Rebecca, why aren't you in bed resting?
- I just told you.

34:48.900 --> 34:51.224
I wanted to surprise
you for Valentine's day.

34:51.225 --> 34:53.931
Uh... well, I'm, uh, I'm surprised.

34:53.931 --> 34:57.405
Um... look, uh, I know
you gotta eat something, 

34:57.405 --> 34:59.405
so I... I got all your favorites.

34:59.439 --> 35:02.572
I got split pea soup from the deli, 

35:02.606 --> 35:04.572
cheese ravioli

35:04.606 --> 35:06.821
from the Italian
restaurant on San Vicente.

35:06.821 --> 35:11.244
I got chopped salad...
garbanzo beans, no blue cheese.

35:11.244 --> 35:14.814
And... if it's possible for
you to love me any more...

35:14.814 --> 35:16.972
Cheesecake from Feinberg's.

35:16.972 --> 35:19.510
I can't believe you went
to all of those places.

35:19.544 --> 35:21.447
Well, now you gotta eat, so, 
uh, what do you want first?

35:21.447 --> 35:23.147
Um, yes, I will eat later.

35:23.181 --> 35:24.396
Right now I just have to keep stirring

35:24.396 --> 35:25.510
or the chocolate's gonna get dry.

35:25.511 --> 35:26.862
Well, all right. Let me stir it for you.

35:26.895 --> 35:28.956
No, it's okay. I really
want to do it myself.

35:28.956 --> 35:30.511
Well, I... look, I need you
to eat something, all right?

35:30.512 --> 35:31.922
I'm gonna eat when I'm done.

35:31.956 --> 35:33.922
- Rebecca, you know what?
- Let me stir... - Justin!

35:33.956 --> 35:35.922
- What?
-Your mom gave me this recipe.

35:35.956 --> 35:37.856
She talked me through how to do it.

35:37.889 --> 35:39.690
I bought imported dark chocolate.

35:39.723 --> 35:41.690
I bought a heart shaped brownie pan, 

35:41.723 --> 35:43.690
and... I've been planning
this for a long time, 

35:43.723 --> 35:46.523
and right now, I just... I
really... I really need something

35:46.556 --> 35:49.757
- to work out the way that I planned, okay?
- Okay.

35:51.290 --> 35:53.356
I, uh...

35:55.382 --> 35:58.615
I... I got you a
Valentine's day present, too, 

35:58.649 --> 36:00.715
but, um, in all the craziness, 

36:00.749 --> 36:03.814
I... I think I left it at the hospital.

36:05.814 --> 36:08.282
It's okay.

36:08.315 --> 36:11.615
I can wait till next year.

36:16.288 --> 36:19.219
You know, Valentine's day
hardly ever happens on a weekend.

36:19.252 --> 36:21.219
I was picturing... breakfast in bed.

36:21.252 --> 36:23.095
Instead we're spending it here in suits.

36:23.096 --> 36:24.219
Well, the good news...

36:24.252 --> 36:28.533
The announcement is 20 minutes, 
but Valentine's is all day.

36:28.533 --> 36:30.833
Mm. You know, I think we better stop, 

36:30.866 --> 36:32.505
unless we want to end up on Youtube.

36:32.506 --> 36:34.099
If Cooper gets to go to Disneyland, 

36:34.132 --> 36:36.099
can I at least take off this necklace?

36:36.132 --> 36:37.300
The pearls are choking me.

36:37.301 --> 36:39.099
No, honey. That's what Republicans wear.

36:39.132 --> 36:41.933
I've got right
- wing hair, so suck it up. Hey.

36:41.967 --> 36:43.284
Can I at least wish Aunt Kitty good luck?

36:43.285 --> 36:44.666
Yeah, just don't get
in anyone's way, okay?

36:44.700 --> 36:46.166
You look great. Mm
- hmm.

36:46.199 --> 36:48.600
God, I hate Valentine's day.

36:48.633 --> 36:50.800
Oh, did you ever get Roy anything?

36:50.833 --> 36:53.572
- Yes. Chili pepper chocolate.
- Oh.

36:53.572 --> 36:54.881
And we broke up.

36:54.881 --> 36:57.138
- Wait. Seriously?
- On Valentine's day?

36:57.138 --> 36:59.838
It was a mutual decision. I'm sorry.

36:59.871 --> 37:02.038
No. It's the right thing.

37:02.072 --> 37:04.972
I'll be alone for the rest
of my life, but I'm fine.

37:05.005 --> 37:06.439
Sarah...

37:06.472 --> 37:08.439
Mnh
- mnh. It's true. Look at my track record.

37:08.472 --> 37:09.938
My marriage fell apart.

37:09.972 --> 37:11.439
Every relationship since has fizzled.

37:11.472 --> 37:13.439
Luc was too much of a good thing, 

37:13.472 --> 37:14.750
and Roy... never really heated up.

37:14.750 --> 37:16.897
That's a couple of
misfires. You're still young.

37:16.898 --> 37:18.150
Exactly. And you look great.

37:18.184 --> 37:20.250
Right. Guys, come on. Stop it.

37:20.284 --> 37:23.050
I mean, I'm good at a lot of
things... my career, my kids.

37:23.083 --> 37:25.250
I just... I have this one area of my life

37:25.284 --> 37:28.250
that I don't seem to be able to make work.

37:28.284 --> 37:31.617
Whoever said you can have
it all is a big fat liar.

37:31.651 --> 37:34.484
Oh, I needed that mimosa.

37:34.517 --> 37:36.486
Well, on the upside, Holly
didn't sell her shares.

37:36.487 --> 37:37.983
Oh, please don't start with that mess.

37:38.017 --> 37:40.017
Otherwise I'm gonna have to toss the juice

37:40.050 --> 37:41.150
and go to the straight grape.

37:41.151 --> 37:42.517
Okay, they're almost ready to start.

37:42.551 --> 37:44.983
I can't believe the three of
you are in here drinking...

37:45.017 --> 37:47.150
While the GOP is out there
denying global warming.

37:47.184 --> 37:49.816
Mm. Thanks. That's it, s...
n... no, just a little sip.

37:49.850 --> 37:51.450
Oh, hey.

37:51.484 --> 37:54.250
I'm so sorry. It's awful.

37:54.284 --> 37:56.250
Oh, thanks. Come here.

37:56.284 --> 37:58.417
Mm. How's Rebecca?

37:58.450 --> 37:59.917
Okay, I guess.

37:59.950 --> 38:02.783
Um, she's, uh, she's here.

38:02.816 --> 38:04.783
Seven, eight, 

38:04.816 --> 38:06.317
nine ladybugs, 

38:06.350 --> 38:08.551
ten ladybugs. No, seven...

38:08.584 --> 38:12.217
Well, hey. Hey. I...
I'll leave you two alone.

38:12.250 --> 38:14.716
No, no. Hey, Rebecca, 
I'm so happy you came.

38:14.750 --> 38:17.517
- I mean, you totally didn't have to, but...
- Oh, no. I wanted to.

38:19.551 --> 38:21.716
How's Evan?

38:21.750 --> 38:24.950
Oh, he's great. He's great.

38:24.983 --> 38:26.950
You know, um...

38:28.983 --> 38:30.950
Well, I... I just know how...

38:30.983 --> 38:34.117
well, y... if you ever
want to talk, I... I'm here.

38:34.150 --> 38:35.770
Rebecca, I'm so glad you're here.

38:35.771 --> 38:37.883
- They're ready for you.
- Oh, gosh. It's time.

38:37.917 --> 38:39.750
Okay, come on. Go see grandma.

38:39.783 --> 38:42.517
Come on. Let's go bye...
ooh, what a big boy you are.

38:42.551 --> 38:44.417
Okay. Well... okay, wish me luck.

38:44.450 --> 38:46.716
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

38:46.750 --> 38:49.705
Well... you have always
looked good in red.

38:49.706 --> 38:51.217
Whew. Oh, my goodness.

38:51.250 --> 38:54.217
- You nervous?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah, I think, um, 

38:54.250 --> 38:56.217
making a speech in
front of a live audience

38:56.250 --> 38:56.801
is a very different thing
than a one- on- one interview

38:56.801 --> 38:58.441
in the studio, and...
your speech is great.

38:58.442 --> 38:59.769
Okay? You're gonna knock 'em dead.

38:59.801 --> 39:02.383
Mm. I'll be sitting in the
front row making faces at you.

39:02.383 --> 39:04.850
No, Robert, you're not.
We talked about this.

39:04.883 --> 39:05.871
I want you on the stage.

39:05.871 --> 39:07.709
No. This moment needs to be about you.

39:07.743 --> 39:09.234
I'll take my moment right now.

39:09.235 --> 39:11.075
Kitty, it's time to meet your public.

39:11.109 --> 39:12.976
Oh, hell.

39:15.010 --> 39:16.976
Excuse us.

39:17.010 --> 39:20.476
- Well, I guess, um, I guess they've decided for us.
- Yeah.

39:20.509 --> 39:21.943
Okay.

39:26.075 --> 39:27.200
I don't understand.

39:27.200 --> 39:28.617
That painting's already been paid for.

39:28.617 --> 39:31.584
No, I don't want to return
it. Look, I was just...

39:31.617 --> 39:34.584
I was hoping that you
could just credit the card

39:34.617 --> 39:37.084
of the man who bought it for me, 

39:37.118 --> 39:38.584
and... and use mine instead.

39:38.617 --> 39:41.084
Mm. Of course.

39:41.118 --> 39:42.717
I'll get the paperwork.

39:42.751 --> 39:44.751
Thank you.

39:51.284 --> 39:54.751
What's the matter? You
don't like my painting?

39:58.084 --> 39:59.284
Luc.

39:59.284 --> 40:00.987
And if you can't be with the one you love

40:00.987 --> 40:03.354
- This is your painting?
- Oui.

40:03.387 --> 40:05.854
No, I... I love it.

40:05.888 --> 40:08.154
Oh, my God. I can't believe this.

40:08.187 --> 40:10.154
Wh... what are you doing here?

40:10.187 --> 40:11.654
Uh, I've been...

40:11.687 --> 40:14.354
- I've been working with this gallery.
- Oh.

40:14.387 --> 40:17.721
I try to contact you. You never respond.

40:19.287 --> 40:22.120
I couldn't.

40:22.154 --> 40:26.254
He seems like a nice man...
the one who bought it for you.

40:26.287 --> 40:29.254
- Oh, we're not... you know...
- In love?

40:29.287 --> 40:32.287
No. We're... we're just friends.

40:32.320 --> 40:34.287
Oh.

40:34.320 --> 40:36.920
I'm glad to hear that.

40:39.087 --> 40:42.721
So what did you love about my painting?

40:42.754 --> 40:45.220
I, um...

40:45.254 --> 40:48.220
I loved the line in the middle...

40:48.254 --> 40:51.254
The way it's trying to escape.

40:51.287 --> 40:53.254
Love the one you're with

40:53.287 --> 40:55.621
reminded me of something I lost.

40:55.654 --> 40:59.287
What if the blue line
is not trying to escape, 

40:59.320 --> 41:03.754
but trying to find his way home?

41:03.788 --> 41:07.220
Well, that would be a
