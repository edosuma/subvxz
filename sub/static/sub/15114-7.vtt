00:02.291 --> 00:05.522
I am the goddamn mayor
of this motherfucking city!

00:05.556 --> 00:08.029
And I want this hole fixed now!

00:08.465 --> 00:11.823
Mr. Langley has previously
undiagnosed open-angle glaucoma.

00:11.857 --> 00:14.242
- <i>To take that shot...</i>
- Motherfucker.

00:14.276 --> 00:16.096
- Where'd you get the urine?
- I don't understand.

00:16.131 --> 00:18.816
Bulbocapnine... used to
induce a severe stupor.

00:18.851 --> 00:20.745
Grandpa, did they do this to you?

00:20.779 --> 00:22.341
Hell no, we won't go!

00:22.375 --> 00:25.640
Mr. Zajac is this an attempt to get
back into your wife's good graces?

00:26.175 --> 00:27.176
Don't resist.

00:29.007 --> 00:30.115
I love you.

00:30.149 --> 00:32.253
- Where is the mayor?
- You'll be apprised soon enough.

00:32.287 --> 00:34.128
Until then, I believe
you have a job to perform.

00:34.663 --> 00:36.404
You have been paid,

00:36.438 --> 00:38.920
so may we start the fucking
treatment, please?

00:38.954 --> 00:41.940
With the first injection,
the pain may be sharp.

00:41.975 --> 00:44.796
After hours of seemingly
unending violence,

00:44.831 --> 00:47.923
<i>the toll of injury</i>
<i>and destruction is growing.</i>

00:48.207 --> 00:50.525
CPD shot an unarmed kid.

00:50.543 --> 00:52.988
We've always had
a mutual respect, Mac.

00:53.022 --> 00:55.009
We have, you being cut from the
same cloth as your father.

00:55.043 --> 00:57.409
20 years ago, we urged Tom to ask

00:57.443 --> 00:59.255
<i>for a deployment</i>
<i>of the National Guard.</i>

00:59.290 --> 01:00.746
I'd like to hear it from him.

01:00.780 --> 01:02.304
You will, in due time.

01:02.338 --> 01:03.617
- Sam.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

01:03.651 --> 01:05.576
The papers on your table, Rosebud.

01:05.611 --> 01:07.970
<i>I'm pretty sure the</i>
<i>handwriting's Stone's.</i>

02:31.667 --> 02:33.745
<i>I love you.</i>

03:24.882 --> 03:26.741
There are tanks in the streets.

03:29.584 --> 03:31.924
How did we get here,

03:31.958 --> 03:34.274
to this fractured state?

03:34.309 --> 03:36.782
<i>In the last 48 hours</i>

03:36.816 --> 03:38.966
I've become clear on many things.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.669
Most importantly
that I am at my strongest

03:44.204 --> 03:46.021
when we are aligned.

03:49.106 --> 03:51.547
<i>Your concerns were founded.</i>

03:51.581 --> 03:52.951
<i>I cannot do this alone.</i>

03:52.986 --> 03:54.622
I need a tether

03:54.656 --> 03:58.690
should I again become unbound.

03:58.724 --> 04:01.059
<i>I need a mirror.</i>

04:01.094 --> 04:02.627
<i>Someone who knows,</i>

04:02.662 --> 04:05.230
someone who sees things as they are.

04:07.633 --> 04:09.534
I need you.

04:21.081 --> 04:23.916
We have much to discuss.

04:23.950 --> 04:25.918
I understand the press is camped
out in front of City Hall.

04:25.952 --> 04:27.486
Yes, sir.
We need an explanation.

04:29.155 --> 04:30.789
Casualties during the turmoil?

04:30.823 --> 04:34.192
47 injuries.
Four of those were cops, two firemen.

04:34.227 --> 04:36.061
Only one fatality, a looter.

04:36.095 --> 04:37.729
17 years old shot by CPD.

04:37.764 --> 04:40.098
The unrest has been tamped
down thanks to the Guard,

04:40.133 --> 04:42.468
but the stories we floated
to cover your absence,

04:42.502 --> 04:44.336
- they won't hold.
- Get Cullen.

04:44.371 --> 04:46.472
Sir, if we want
the explanation to hold,

04:46.506 --> 04:48.140
we're gonna need to fill in details.

04:48.175 --> 04:50.376
The public was told one
thing, the council another.

04:50.410 --> 04:52.244
Ignoring the problem
won't make it go away.

04:52.279 --> 04:53.946
I have the mayor.

04:54.680 --> 04:56.682
The press is not gonna let up.

04:56.717 --> 04:59.518
- We need to be prepared to...
- Sir.

05:00.820 --> 05:02.088
Mac.

05:02.122 --> 05:05.758
Nice to hear from you, Tom.
Been a while.

05:05.793 --> 05:08.694
Listen, we're grateful for your
help during this chaotic situation,

05:08.729 --> 05:10.597
but I think it's time for
the boys to go home now.

05:10.631 --> 05:13.533
You're feeling confident
it's all under control then?

05:13.567 --> 05:14.935
<i>I am.</i>

05:14.969 --> 05:17.237
Far be it for the state
to overstay its welcome

05:17.271 --> 05:19.038
in your great city.

05:19.072 --> 05:20.906
Swift and orderly,
we'll be on our way.

05:20.940 --> 05:22.541
Thank you.

05:22.575 --> 05:24.577
Everything all right with you, Tom?

05:24.611 --> 05:26.879
Love to Edie.

05:26.914 --> 05:30.051
What's the price tag
on that little operation?

05:30.086 --> 05:32.089
Around 10.3 million.

05:32.123 --> 05:35.093
Can't imagine any mayor wanting

05:35.127 --> 05:38.397
the state to bear the cost
for his city's mistakes.

05:38.431 --> 05:39.965
Tom.

05:39.999 --> 05:41.366
Thank you, Meredith.

05:45.538 --> 05:49.275
Sir, someone on the council
will leak what they were told.

05:49.309 --> 05:52.078
Someone or your former employer?

05:52.112 --> 05:54.514
Ross certainly poses a threat.

05:54.548 --> 05:57.083
Personally, I wouldn't have...

05:59.052 --> 06:01.890
<i>I respect the need to keep</i>
<i>your private life private,</i>

06:01.924 --> 06:04.496
but you disappeared
while the city burned.

06:04.530 --> 06:07.233
And now you run the risk
of destroying

06:07.267 --> 06:09.535
whatever tenuous trust
the people have left in you.

06:11.638 --> 06:13.705
We need a more coherent explanation

06:13.739 --> 06:15.740
as to why no one
saw you for two days.

06:19.212 --> 06:22.414
- What was his name?
- Who?

06:22.448 --> 06:23.815
The kid.
The looter.

06:23.849 --> 06:25.283
Why?

06:26.986 --> 06:29.454
Jerome Mathis.
Street name: Smoke.

06:29.488 --> 06:32.123
<i>Would you like to sit down with
Superintendent Royczyk first thing?</i>

06:32.158 --> 06:35.494
A phone call will suffice.
I'm sure Jim is quite busy

06:35.528 --> 06:37.863
with all that's transpired.

06:37.897 --> 06:40.198
<i>Not one of the
protestors has a record.</i>

06:40.233 --> 06:42.100
<i>- So?</i>
- That's not a rebuttal.

06:42.134 --> 06:43.802
You didn't make an argument.

06:43.836 --> 06:45.637
They had every right
to peaceably assemble.

06:45.671 --> 06:48.107
Please. They were on
private property.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.609
I thought you went to law school

06:50.643 --> 06:53.112
And what was peaceable about the
brawl you got wrapped up in?

06:53.146 --> 06:55.881
- We're not talking about me.
- We're not?

06:55.916 --> 06:57.634
What's the State's
Attorney's office get

06:57.635 --> 06:59.351
out of pushing these
prosecutions through?

06:59.385 --> 07:01.920
The satisfaction of a job well done.

07:01.955 --> 07:05.023
I wonder, if a politician
pulls a stunt

07:05.058 --> 07:06.959
and it doesn't hit the front page,

07:06.993 --> 07:09.028
did he even make a sound?

07:10.563 --> 07:12.198
You know, maybe, just maybe,

07:12.232 --> 07:15.000
I want to do right by these folks.
You ever considered that?

07:15.034 --> 07:17.169
It's not their fault they don't have
a friend in the mayor's office.

07:17.203 --> 07:19.671
Wasting your breath.
I only vote if it's a job requirement.

07:20.206 --> 07:23.174
Your cynicism is fucking exhausting.

07:30.816 --> 07:33.984
It will raise questions,
my continued presence.

07:34.019 --> 07:35.886
I owe no explanation.

07:37.155 --> 07:38.556
What did you see, Tom?

07:40.358 --> 07:42.693
It doesn't matter.

07:48.433 --> 07:50.901
- Take Mrs. Kane around back.
- Yes, sir.

08:04.085 --> 08:06.185
Were there specific
threats against you?

08:06.220 --> 08:09.789
What do you say to the accusations that
this is a repeat of the '93 riots?

08:09.823 --> 08:13.392
Mr. Mayor, was the council notified
of your location during the riots?

08:16.096 --> 08:19.498
The disorder has been contained
by our fine guardsmen and women

08:19.532 --> 08:21.400
who are now on their way home
to their families.

08:21.434 --> 08:23.434
I know I speak for all Chicagoans

08:23.468 --> 08:25.566
when I saw that we are
grateful for their service.

08:25.600 --> 08:29.033
I know many of us gave in to our baser
instincts over the last two days,

08:29.068 --> 08:32.669
but I have faith in us all
that we can rise above fear

08:32.705 --> 08:36.508
and recrimination to rebuild
what's been lost.

08:36.542 --> 08:40.477
The bonds formed in adversity
will strengthen what remains.

08:40.513 --> 08:43.481
To that end, I would like to
assure the family of Jerome Mathis

08:43.515 --> 08:45.883
that his death will
be fully investigated.

08:45.917 --> 08:47.551
Thank you.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.124
<i>Both fingerprints and handwriting.</i>

08:54.158 --> 08:56.226
<i>Great.</i>
<i>And how long would that take?</i>

08:56.260 --> 08:58.394
<i>Could I get that in 24 hours?</i>

09:01.299 --> 09:02.632
Great. And what's
that going to cost me?

09:04.368 --> 09:06.669
- Great, thank you.
- Answer your telephone.

09:06.703 --> 09:09.305
Where the hell is your assistant? I've
been trying to call you for, like, ever.

09:09.339 --> 09:11.540
Yes?

09:11.574 --> 09:13.909
<i>I know many of us gave
in to our baser instincts</i>

09:13.943 --> 09:15.310
<i>over the last two days...</i>

09:15.345 --> 09:17.613
Look who's home.

09:17.647 --> 09:20.850
Full of platitudes.

09:20.885 --> 09:24.788
Blah, blah, blah.
Snap, crackle, pop.

09:24.822 --> 09:26.040
Wait for it.

09:26.041 --> 09:27.957
<i>To that end, I would
like to assure the family</i>

09:27.991 --> 09:30.694
<i>of Jerome Mathis that his death
will be fully investigated.</i>

09:30.728 --> 09:33.063
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- Wow.

09:33.097 --> 09:36.066
What do you think, Jacks? Should we
let him change the conversation?

09:36.101 --> 09:38.435
I also found another source
who saw him on Chestnut

09:38.470 --> 09:40.003
the night before the evictions.

09:40.038 --> 09:43.006
Said he was screaming,
seemed unhinged.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.541
Want me to run with it?

10:13.639 --> 10:15.873
Royczyk's holding on three.

10:23.216 --> 10:25.150
This is insane.

10:25.184 --> 10:27.118
The First Lady's
returning to her duties.

10:27.153 --> 10:28.553
No need to feel threatened.

10:28.587 --> 10:29.954
- Don't do that.
- What?

10:29.989 --> 10:32.323
He's taking everything I care about,

10:32.358 --> 10:36.361
flipping it upside down and now
he's gonna use it as a soapbox.

10:36.395 --> 10:38.663
And I'm just standing here
like I'm okay with it.

10:38.698 --> 10:41.033
So, you got two choices...

10:41.067 --> 10:44.670
stay or go.

10:44.704 --> 10:46.638
You've done an exceptional job, Jim.

10:46.673 --> 10:49.108
I'm just sorry it took me this
long to thank you in person.

10:49.142 --> 10:52.211
<i>At least it wasn't</i>
<i>'93 all over again,</i>

10:52.245 --> 10:55.514
<i>no matter what those cable news</i>
<i>yahoos seem to think.</i>

10:55.548 --> 10:57.249
Speaking of,

10:57.283 --> 11:00.018
I'm concerned about this
Jerome Mathis situation.

11:00.053 --> 11:02.754
These things have a way of blowing
themselves out of proportion.

11:02.788 --> 11:04.956
Frankly, my men should be commended

11:04.991 --> 11:06.924
for their restraint
the past two days.

11:06.959 --> 11:10.695
And I don't disagree. But I'd feel more
comfortable if I had all the facts.

11:10.729 --> 11:13.999
Mathis was observed

11:14.033 --> 11:15.867
leaving an electronics store

11:15.902 --> 11:17.669
carrying a stereo.

11:17.704 --> 11:20.072
<i>The store's windows were smashed.</i>

11:20.107 --> 11:23.142
<i>He saw the officers,</i>
<i>dropped the stereo and ran.</i>

11:23.176 --> 11:26.779
<i>He ignored repeated requests to stop.</i>

11:26.813 --> 11:28.180
Another unit responded.

11:28.215 --> 11:30.350
He turned into
the squad car's headlights

11:30.384 --> 11:32.285
and appeared to be holding a firearm.

11:32.320 --> 11:36.857
Officer Albanese fired one round,

11:36.891 --> 11:39.126
<i>striking Mathis in the chest.</i>

11:39.160 --> 11:42.196
<i>He was later revealed</i>
<i>to be holding an iPod.</i>

11:42.230 --> 11:46.033
Listen, I don't deny
this is unfortunate,

11:46.067 --> 11:48.602
but it could have all been avoided

11:48.637 --> 11:50.871
if he'd just followed
the officer's instructions.

11:50.906 --> 11:52.807
He was 17, Jim.

11:52.841 --> 11:55.176
<i>He was in and out of juvie</i>
<i>since he was 11.</i>

11:55.211 --> 11:58.546
<i>Drug possession,</i>
<i>distribution, assault.</i>

11:58.581 --> 12:00.748
<i>Let's call a spade a spade.</i>

12:00.783 --> 12:03.251
<i>He was a bad kid, Tom.</i>

12:03.285 --> 12:05.687
I'm sure his mom is sad,

12:05.721 --> 12:07.989
but he was no great loss
for the community.

12:08.023 --> 12:11.026
<i>It was a good shot.</i>
<i>I stand by my men.</i>

12:11.061 --> 12:12.695
Fair enough.

12:12.729 --> 12:15.564
When this is all behind us,
we're long overdue for a meal.

12:16.599 --> 12:19.503
How about a hot dog in the mayor's box
at the next Cubbies game?

12:19.668 --> 12:21.405
Looking forward to it.

12:24.981 --> 12:26.818
<i>I think it's a terrible idea.</i>

12:27.352 --> 12:29.020
Why is that?

12:29.054 --> 12:31.355
He was a criminal.
Armed or not,

12:31.390 --> 12:33.458
it will be difficult
to paint him as sympathetic.

12:33.492 --> 12:36.294
Regardless, his mother is grieving.

12:36.328 --> 12:38.062
She deserves my condolences.

12:38.097 --> 12:39.364
So do it privately.

12:39.398 --> 12:42.000
There's no reason
to make it a press event.

12:42.035 --> 12:43.568
I disagree.

12:43.603 --> 12:46.105
The city needs to know the
mayor is aware and in control.

12:46.140 --> 12:49.142
He'll appear both strong
and emotionally engaged

12:49.176 --> 12:50.476
in the plight of those affected.

12:50.511 --> 12:53.680
In other words, you're using
a grieving mother

12:53.715 --> 12:56.350
as a political prop.
No one is gonna buy it as sincere.

12:57.385 --> 12:59.754
Because they haven't
so many times before?

13:00.288 --> 13:03.224
<i>Moral issues aside,</i>
<i>you're opening yourself up</i>

13:03.258 --> 13:06.193
to a host of criticisms that
play right into the hands

13:06.228 --> 13:08.462
of those who want to see
Lennox Gardens fail.

13:09.497 --> 13:10.831
There are larger concerns

13:10.866 --> 13:13.134
than your pet project,
Ms. Fredricks.

13:16.605 --> 13:19.039
If you're committed to this,

13:19.074 --> 13:21.809
I respectfully ask that you have lan

13:21.843 --> 13:23.344
coordinate with Moretti.

13:23.378 --> 13:24.979
I'm not comfortable being involved.

13:28.099 --> 13:30.318
No decision needs
to be made at this time.

13:38.593 --> 13:40.828
<i>Kane's purging his</i>
<i>organization in the 11th,</i>

13:40.863 --> 13:43.498
<i>14th, 21st, and 46th.</i>

13:43.532 --> 13:46.234
So we're focusing our efforts there.

13:47.118 --> 13:49.537
Interesting timing for
this story to take hold,

13:49.572 --> 13:50.839
don't you think?

13:50.873 --> 13:53.175
We've also set our sights on the 3rd,

13:53.209 --> 13:57.144
6th, 17th, 24th, 27th, and 28th.

13:58.746 --> 14:00.132
Giving what went down at the Gardens,

14:00.166 --> 14:01.522
we're pretty confident
they're up for grabs.

14:01.556 --> 14:03.438
It might have been up for grabs.

14:03.473 --> 14:07.415
Maybe, if Walsh hadn't rammed that
anti-felon bill through the lege.

14:07.949 --> 14:09.704
Cullen's gonna pocket veto.

14:10.239 --> 14:13.282
You sure about that? I saw him last
night touting Walsh's efforts.

14:13.317 --> 14:16.232
Spoke with him this morning.
Now that he understands

14:16.266 --> 14:18.520
the situation, he's agreed
to stick it in a drawer.

14:18.804 --> 14:21.503
It's impressive.
She gets the win,

14:21.537 --> 14:23.291
keeps the boogieman,

14:23.325 --> 14:26.308
and you've protected
an important voting bloc.

14:26.842 --> 14:28.630
What you must have done

14:29.158 --> 14:31.112
for him to let you go...

14:32.647 --> 14:34.128
Can you set the meet?

14:36.218 --> 14:39.433
My husband went into hiding
at my insistence.

14:40.117 --> 14:42.483
And were it up to me,
he would not have returned

14:42.517 --> 14:44.071
until you'd done your job.

14:44.856 --> 14:46.394
Fortunately for you both,

14:46.428 --> 14:48.150
your lack of faith will not affect

14:48.184 --> 14:50.171
my commitment to the task at hand.

14:50.706 --> 14:52.260
I understand how,

14:52.795 --> 14:54.843
with the distant history
you and my husband share,

14:55.877 --> 14:58.227
it could be difficult
working symbiotically...

14:58.261 --> 15:01.245
There's nothing distant
about my historical concerns.

15:01.279 --> 15:03.151
There's reason to believe that,

15:03.152 --> 15:05.022
had Langley's identity been
kept confidential,

15:05.057 --> 15:07.077
his accomplice would
already be in custody.

15:07.112 --> 15:09.300
And that leak couldn't
have come from your office?

15:09.334 --> 15:13.711
My office has been treated
with disdain and disrespect

15:13.745 --> 15:16.560
from the moment
this investigation began.

15:17.983 --> 15:20.672
A lesser man would have
closed the book with Langley.

15:20.706 --> 15:23.589
How great thou art.

15:25.612 --> 15:28.161
I lie awake at night...

15:30.717 --> 15:32.672
terrified.

15:34.061 --> 15:35.982
Reliving it all.

15:37.311 --> 15:38.899
Hearing the shots.

15:40.083 --> 15:41.815
<i>And you refuse to give me</i>

15:42.349 --> 15:44.270
<i>a reason to believe we're safe.</i>

15:47.027 --> 15:49.710
We believe he's a veteran.

15:50.244 --> 15:52.859
A fellow member
of Langley's sniper team.

15:52.893 --> 15:55.582
<i>With the information we have,</i>

15:55.610 --> 15:58.660
<i>I am confident the heightened</i>
<i>security protocols in place</i>

15:58.694 --> 16:00.816
<i>are sufficient.</i>

16:00.850 --> 16:05.027
In service of a more
symbiotic relationship,

16:06.055 --> 16:07.944
you should know you'll be receiving

16:07.978 --> 16:09.966
wide-ranging subpoenas
in the morning...

16:10.000 --> 16:12.048
<i>in conjunction with</i>
<i>the corruption cases</i>

16:12.082 --> 16:13.743
<i>you set in motion last month.</i>

16:13.777 --> 16:14.970
Wide-ranging?

16:14.998 --> 16:16.692
<i>Back to '93.</i>

16:17.226 --> 16:20.275
That's an absurd overreach,
even for you.

16:20.310 --> 16:22.792
There isn't a judge in town
who wouldn't agree.

16:22.826 --> 16:24.120
Maybe.

16:24.154 --> 16:26.870
But I'm attempting to make
these cases airtight.

16:26.904 --> 16:30.447
And with 20 years
of records to comb through,

16:30.482 --> 16:32.970
I certainly won't have time
to comment to the press.

16:33.005 --> 16:37.181
If that's what you need
for a successful prosecution.

16:43.015 --> 16:46.958
And I had a chance to look
at the Jerome Mathis case.

16:46.993 --> 16:50.109
Seems like a good shot.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.497
<i>How many more surprises?</i>

16:51.531 --> 16:53.158
Meaning?

16:53.193 --> 16:54.780
<i>These subpoenas.</i>

16:54.815 --> 16:58.291
The result of the arrests of key
members of your organization.

16:59.854 --> 17:01.908
A decision so lacking in clarity

17:01.942 --> 17:04.191
<i>I can only assume it was</i>
<i>your disease at the wheel.</i>

17:04.224 --> 17:06.246
Did you notice any symptoms today?

17:06.281 --> 17:07.907
No.

17:07.943 --> 17:09.163
Despite that, I think it wise

17:09.198 --> 17:11.152
you visit Dr. Harris
sooner rather than later.

17:11.186 --> 17:12.380
One thing at a time.

17:12.415 --> 17:14.935
As for tomorrow,

17:14.971 --> 17:18.086
aren't there matters outside the
office that require your attention?

17:22.791 --> 17:24.913
You're confident you need
no more monitoring?

17:24.948 --> 17:26.669
I'll drop you at home.

17:26.703 --> 17:28.057
I have an errand to run.

18:03.291 --> 18:04.761
I'm sorry.

18:04.796 --> 18:06.163
I didn't realize anyone was home.

18:06.197 --> 18:07.498
I'll get out of your way.

18:07.532 --> 18:09.533
No, that's fine.
You don't have to.

18:17.241 --> 18:18.275
What?

18:18.310 --> 18:20.379
I've been thinking about you.

18:20.413 --> 18:22.514
What you're going through.

18:22.548 --> 18:25.017
It's a Herculean feat.

18:25.051 --> 18:27.852
What?
Living with my parents?

18:27.886 --> 18:30.989
That, too, I suppose.
But no.

18:31.023 --> 18:33.292
I meant...

18:33.326 --> 18:35.328
I'm sorry.
Is this too personal?

18:35.362 --> 18:38.599
I don't know what "this" is.

18:45.339 --> 18:47.408
My mom was a drunk.

18:49.511 --> 18:51.379
Pills on occasion.

18:51.413 --> 18:52.981
She wanted to get clean.

18:53.015 --> 18:56.184
Put in the work, but it didn't stick.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.785
<i>I never blamed her, though.</i>

18:59.855 --> 19:02.156
She tried.
She really did.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.995
You're stronger than she was.

19:12.769 --> 19:15.370
Part of my job

19:15.405 --> 19:18.206
is knowing what to keep
off the mayor's desk.

19:23.980 --> 19:26.748
If you need anything ever.

19:26.783 --> 19:28.617
That's my personal cell.

19:28.651 --> 19:31.186
- Anytime.
- Thanks.

19:34.091 --> 19:36.258
Anytime.

19:53.077 --> 19:55.512
Thanks.
Wait for me outside.

19:57.948 --> 20:00.483
No thanks.
Not tonight.

20:07.491 --> 20:09.092
Glad to see you in one piece.

20:09.126 --> 20:11.895
You and me both.

20:13.731 --> 20:15.565
Plans are changing.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.767
Must be drastic if you
couldn't send the kid.

20:19.403 --> 20:22.905
Our old friend.
His time has come.

20:27.544 --> 20:29.245
<i>You never ask questions.</i>

20:29.279 --> 20:31.814
I always appreciated that about you.

20:39.355 --> 20:41.155
Thanks, Kav.

21:28.871 --> 21:30.805
<i>There weren't no reason for it.</i>

21:31.590 --> 21:33.241
Jerome was a baby.

21:33.775 --> 21:36.111
He was my baby.

21:41.950 --> 21:44.452
I am here today not only as a mayor,

21:44.987 --> 21:46.888
but also as a father.

21:46.889 --> 21:48.857
Our hearts go out
to the Mathis family.

21:49.226 --> 21:50.725
By 3 o'clock, it became clear that...

21:50.726 --> 21:54.396
I want you to eat a little bit more.
Three more bites. Just three more.

21:54.430 --> 21:56.598
<i>We tied at the end of the game.</i>

21:56.633 --> 21:59.234
- <i> but we won when...</i>
- Where's your mat homework, Bits?

21:59.768 --> 22:02.437
I put it in her backpack.

22:04.339 --> 22:06.208
What? It was that
or be late.

22:06.242 --> 22:07.742
Alissa, finish up.
We've got to go, baby.

22:07.743 --> 22:10.412
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

22:11.446 --> 22:13.748
Hush, both of you!

22:13.782 --> 22:16.484
I've assured Ms. Mathis
that my entire administration

22:16.519 --> 22:18.587
is committed to finding
justice for Jerome.

22:18.621 --> 22:20.889
<i>There's never any excuse</i>

22:20.923 --> 22:24.226
for gunning down an unarmed teen.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.128
- That's your boss.
- Who's Jerome?

22:26.162 --> 22:28.598
Go get your backpacks.
Go on, now.

22:28.632 --> 22:31.401
- Please.
- Up you go.

22:31.435 --> 22:34.370
That child was 6'2", 180 pounds

22:34.405 --> 22:37.006
with a record as long as my arm.

22:38.476 --> 22:40.643
- Okay... let's not... hey.
- I can't.

22:40.678 --> 22:42.879
I can't right now.

22:45.116 --> 22:46.983
<i>Do you remember the
story you used to tell me</i>

22:47.017 --> 22:48.718
about the princess and the wolf?

22:50.153 --> 22:51.921
Gave me nightmares.

22:51.955 --> 22:53.155
Kids are impressionable.

22:55.425 --> 22:57.893
I told my mother that
there were wolves on the roof

22:57.928 --> 22:59.628
and you know what she said?

22:59.662 --> 23:01.463
We all have our wolves, Emma.

23:01.498 --> 23:03.833
Those were her words of comfort.

23:03.867 --> 23:06.903
Yeah, she's a piece of work.

23:10.374 --> 23:12.208
Can I?

23:12.242 --> 23:14.343
I did it all the time in the clinic.

23:27.157 --> 23:29.792
- How much?
- <i>Two CCs.</i>

23:48.277 --> 23:50.345
There's nothing in there
that will get you high.

23:50.379 --> 23:52.513
Good luck.

23:54.483 --> 23:56.517
Despite what experience
my daughter may claim,

23:56.552 --> 23:58.252
she is not a medical professional.

23:58.286 --> 24:00.354
Unless you'd like
to find other employment,

24:00.388 --> 24:03.057
I suggest you don't share
your responsibilities again.

24:03.091 --> 24:05.459
Yes, ma'am.

24:15.403 --> 24:17.237
Hello, Dad.

24:44.269 --> 24:46.670
You can't get five feet
down a hallway around here

24:46.704 --> 24:48.438
without a reporter
asking the question.

24:48.473 --> 24:50.340
We're gonna need something
better than no comment.

24:50.375 --> 24:51.775
We're gonna look like assholes.

24:51.809 --> 24:54.745
Press will get bored and move on.

24:54.779 --> 24:56.980
To Jerome Mathis, maybe.

24:57.015 --> 24:58.849
<i>The riots were unfortunate.</i>

24:58.884 --> 25:01.152
But the story will conclude
as they all do.

25:01.186 --> 25:04.288
- In the meantime...
- They're not asking about the riots.

25:04.323 --> 25:05.957
They're asking about you.

25:05.991 --> 25:07.858
Where you've been.
What we knew.

25:07.893 --> 25:10.695
In the meantime, we are fast
approaching the annual vote

25:10.729 --> 25:12.797
to authorize the selling of bonds

25:12.831 --> 25:14.599
to cover the city's expenditures.

25:14.633 --> 25:17.201
Pro forma.
I foresee no concerns.

25:17.236 --> 25:20.905
The request will be
considerably larger than usual.

25:20.939 --> 25:23.874
Many unexpected costs this quarter.

25:23.908 --> 25:25.608
How much larger?

25:25.643 --> 25:27.210
We're still crunching the numbers.

25:27.244 --> 25:28.712
A revised preliminary budget

25:28.746 --> 25:30.414
will be distributed for review
by the end of the week.

25:30.448 --> 25:32.082
I didn't bring you here
to talk specifics.

25:32.116 --> 25:34.851
Rather, to make clear
that for the financial health

25:34.885 --> 25:37.120
of the city, there can
be no push back.

25:37.154 --> 25:40.090
DC's nice this time of year.

25:40.124 --> 25:43.025
I hope you had some time
to enjoy yourself.

25:45.062 --> 25:46.696
<i>How does he seem to you?</i>

25:46.730 --> 25:48.965
His personality, his emotional life?

25:48.999 --> 25:51.500
Before this treatment
he was growing soft,

25:51.535 --> 25:54.203
susceptible to suggestion.

25:54.237 --> 25:56.772
I've been concerned.

25:56.806 --> 25:58.841
As you should be.

25:58.875 --> 26:02.545
Since he's returned?

26:02.580 --> 26:04.447
More focused.

26:04.481 --> 26:08.484
Aware of the weaknesses
exhibited in the resent past.

26:08.519 --> 26:11.287
Determined to steel himself.

26:12.889 --> 26:14.357
But?

26:16.726 --> 26:20.363
Vestiges of the personality
shift remain.

26:20.397 --> 26:24.334
A surprising attachment to certain...

26:26.271 --> 26:30.040
people remains steadfast.

26:30.075 --> 26:32.810
I suspect any improvement

26:32.844 --> 26:35.246
he's experienced from the
treatment he received

26:35.280 --> 26:38.816
is likely a placebo affect.

26:38.850 --> 26:42.785
But the goal here is a
prolonged life worth living.

26:42.820 --> 26:44.754
If this has given him that,

26:44.789 --> 26:47.557
even temporarily,
I consider it a success.

26:47.591 --> 26:49.993
So...

26:50.027 --> 26:52.462
you don't recommend
confronting him on the issue?

26:52.496 --> 26:54.364
<i>No need to speed</i>
<i>the return of symptoms.</i>

26:56.033 --> 26:58.635
My greatest concern has
always been your husband's

26:58.670 --> 27:02.272
unwillingness to honestly
accept his disease.

27:02.306 --> 27:04.541
Choosing to include you suggests

27:04.575 --> 27:07.043
he's beginning to come
to terms with his situation.

27:08.612 --> 27:10.513
Thank you, Dr. Harris.

27:22.893 --> 27:25.829
And you're redacting any reference
to the mayor specifically?

27:25.863 --> 27:28.531
I thought we were
supposed to highlight those.

27:28.566 --> 27:29.766
"Yes" will suffice.

27:29.800 --> 27:32.068
- Mr. Todd.
- What?

27:32.102 --> 27:33.536
- Um...
- What?

27:33.571 --> 27:36.473
Mr. Todd, you might
want to take a look at this.

27:40.612 --> 27:43.481
Sir?

27:45.451 --> 27:47.285
Your phone call with Royczyk,

27:47.320 --> 27:48.587
it's on the "Trib" 's website.

27:48.621 --> 27:50.122
Everywhere now.

27:50.156 --> 27:52.457
CNS, FNN, "The Times."

27:52.492 --> 27:54.727
Who knows how many blogs?

27:54.761 --> 27:57.764
<i>I'm concerned about
this Jerome Mathis situation.</i>

27:57.798 --> 27:59.099
<i>It was a good shot.</i>

27:59.133 --> 28:00.467
<i>He was 17, Jim.</i>

28:00.501 --> 28:02.635
<i>Let's call a spade a spade.</i>

28:02.670 --> 28:05.872
<i>He was a bad kid, Tom.</i>
<i>I'm sure his mom is sad,</i>

28:05.906 --> 28:08.342
<i>but he was no great loss</i>
<i>for the community,</i>

28:08.376 --> 28:11.011
<i>no matter what those cable</i>
<i>news yahoos seem to think.</i>

28:11.045 --> 28:13.780
Is it accurate?
Is that the conversation you had?

28:13.815 --> 28:15.816
Close enough.

28:15.850 --> 28:17.351
How are we gonna handle this?

28:17.386 --> 28:19.454
Damage is done.

28:19.488 --> 28:21.656
Shouldn't we call in
a telecom expert,

28:21.690 --> 28:23.257
make sure our phone
system isn't compromised?

28:23.292 --> 28:26.894
There are safeguards in place here.

28:28.296 --> 28:30.464
I'm confident it was
the superintendent's phone

28:30.499 --> 28:32.600
<i>that was compromised.</i>

28:35.954 --> 28:38.155
Jim didn't deserve this.

28:57.609 --> 29:00.410
<i>Ms. Kane,</i>
<i>Dave Hoffman, again.</i>

29:00.445 --> 29:02.145
<i>My seventh message.</i>

29:02.180 --> 29:04.048
<i>Really don't want to make</i>
<i>life difficult for you,</i>

29:04.082 --> 29:07.518
<i>but if you don't call me back</i>
<i>I'm not gonna have a choice.</i>

29:07.553 --> 29:10.254
Glad to see your phone works.

29:10.289 --> 29:12.223
Hi.

29:12.258 --> 29:14.626
Can I talk to you real quick?

29:14.660 --> 29:16.361
My car's parked over there.

29:23.169 --> 29:25.003
You okay?

29:25.037 --> 29:26.638
Mostly.

29:26.672 --> 29:28.640
You clean?

29:33.446 --> 29:36.948
Well, I'm glad for you, but...

29:36.983 --> 29:39.651
this ain't right.

29:39.685 --> 29:41.887
<i>I can't take you out.</i>

29:41.921 --> 29:44.923
I can't... I can't
treat you like...

29:44.957 --> 29:46.958
like I want to treat my girl.

29:46.993 --> 29:49.228
<i>So I keep doing all</i>
<i>this shit for you.</i>

29:49.262 --> 29:51.397
If you're just calling me
when you want a fix,

29:51.431 --> 29:53.332
be straight about it.

29:53.366 --> 29:55.367
You...

29:55.401 --> 29:57.937
you're the only one who ever cared.

30:03.477 --> 30:06.178
- Who is it?
- It's my parole officer.

30:06.213 --> 30:07.880
He just keeps calling and calling.

30:07.914 --> 30:11.117
The test, I thought I had it
handled, but I can't go back.

30:11.151 --> 30:13.219
If he was gonna violate you,
he would have done it already.

30:13.254 --> 30:15.022
Yeah, but he wants something
and I don't know what it is.

30:16.124 --> 30:17.725
What are...
what are you...

30:17.759 --> 30:19.393
Don't! Don't!

30:19.427 --> 30:21.061
You'd rather ask daddy?

30:21.096 --> 30:23.964
Look, you're just
gonna make it worse.

30:23.998 --> 30:26.500
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it like that.

30:30.204 --> 30:32.339
No, yeah, you did.

30:35.410 --> 30:36.977
Sorry to disturb.

30:37.012 --> 30:38.646
Mrs. Kane,
what can I do for you?

30:38.680 --> 30:40.548
I'd like you to pull
together all the work

30:40.582 --> 30:42.216
you've done on Lennox Gardens for me.

30:42.251 --> 30:44.719
Why?

30:47.490 --> 30:50.826
I assumed with the death of Joe Young

30:50.861 --> 30:53.162
and the recent turmoil,
the project was on hold.

30:53.196 --> 30:55.965
I merely want to be
informed for my meeting

30:56.000 --> 30:57.600
with Babe McGantry later today.

30:57.634 --> 30:59.702
<i>I wasn't aware he was</i>
<i>back in consideration.</i>

30:59.736 --> 31:02.271
There were a number of valid reasons

31:02.305 --> 31:04.023
for not going with him
the first time around.

31:04.024 --> 31:05.741
I'd be happy to discuss...

31:05.775 --> 31:08.477
I am perfectly clear on the reasons

31:08.511 --> 31:10.546
behind my husband's decisions.

31:10.580 --> 31:12.949
Information is ammunition

31:12.983 --> 31:15.552
and McGantry is not a man
you meet with unarmed.

31:15.586 --> 31:17.454
But if you're not able to oblige...

31:17.488 --> 31:20.857
No, of course. I'll have my assistant
pull it all together for you.

31:22.894 --> 31:24.527
Thank you.

31:27.031 --> 31:29.733
Nice looking family.

31:42.410 --> 31:44.578
Aunt Rae.

31:44.612 --> 31:47.247
Give me a second.

31:52.587 --> 31:54.855
Sorry.
What's up?

31:56.824 --> 31:58.725
Emma, what's wrong?

31:58.760 --> 32:01.729
Um, I slipped.

32:01.763 --> 32:04.965
Just a few pills
but I failed my test.

32:04.999 --> 32:07.334
- And my parole officer...
- I'll handle it.

32:07.368 --> 32:09.904
- <i>Really?</i>
- Of course.

32:09.938 --> 32:11.472
Your father won't know a thing.

32:11.507 --> 32:14.908
I'll never ask you for anything
like this again, I promise.

32:14.942 --> 32:16.943
You can ask me for whatever you want.

32:16.977 --> 32:20.446
Thank you, lan.
I mean it.

32:27.822 --> 32:31.325
Your office wouldn't have
sufficed for this conversation?

32:31.359 --> 32:33.093
I wanted you to be
clear on the stakes.

32:33.128 --> 32:36.664
The view below, Lennox Gardens.

32:36.698 --> 32:40.134
All that's adjacent,

32:40.168 --> 32:41.535
my investment.

32:43.137 --> 32:45.271
You remember, years back,

32:45.306 --> 32:48.842
when it was made clear that
redevelopment was on the horizon,

32:48.876 --> 32:53.147
deliberately we began to acquire
all that surrounds the project.

32:53.181 --> 32:56.951
You knew this.
Your husband was aware.

32:56.985 --> 33:00.322
What has changed?

33:00.356 --> 33:04.892
Are we operating with different
definitions of progress suddenly?

33:06.394 --> 33:08.362
Semantics are not at issue here.

33:08.397 --> 33:09.997
So what is?

33:10.032 --> 33:12.733
If your husband proceeds
in this fashion,

33:12.768 --> 33:15.002
all you see is worthless.

33:15.037 --> 33:18.306
I suggest you unload it while you
can still recoup your investment.

33:18.340 --> 33:21.776
So Tom hasn't abandoned
his foolish notion?

33:22.978 --> 33:24.846
I had thought your husband and I

33:24.881 --> 33:28.017
were locked in a temporary skirmish

33:28.051 --> 33:31.521
brought on by your disappearance
from the equation.

33:33.323 --> 33:34.757
Was I mistaken?

33:37.228 --> 33:41.899
Meredith, must I articulate
what this will mean?

33:44.769 --> 33:47.371
Do not do this.

33:47.405 --> 33:49.640
It's done, Babe.

33:53.010 --> 33:55.779
You fucking cunt.

33:57.448 --> 33:59.983
You're nothing.

34:00.018 --> 34:04.021
You're a goddamn
dress form with a slit.

34:05.090 --> 34:06.958
I am the constant.

34:06.992 --> 34:09.559
You were always a variable.

34:23.574 --> 34:25.408
Duck sauce?

34:25.442 --> 34:29.045
No longer can he hide
behind the throne.

34:29.079 --> 34:30.513
For once in the history of Chicago,

34:30.547 --> 34:33.014
the PD wasn't being racist asshats.

34:33.050 --> 34:35.851
Numbers are in.
Everything except the 21st.

34:35.886 --> 34:38.420
Thanks.

34:38.456 --> 34:41.458
You know, as much
as I hate the bastard,

34:41.493 --> 34:44.027
Kane never fails to impress.
He just dealt a race card

34:44.062 --> 34:46.996
from the bottom of the deck,
sits back, relaxes,

34:47.031 --> 34:50.833
and lets the righteous indignation
machine do the work for him.

34:50.868 --> 34:52.301
You know?

34:52.335 --> 34:54.335
117 walk shifts.

34:54.371 --> 34:56.371
15% of our universe.

34:56.406 --> 34:59.075
Undecideds breaking
our way two to one.

34:59.109 --> 35:01.611
500,000.

35:01.646 --> 35:04.848
He's okay. Cone of silence.
McGantry?

35:04.883 --> 35:06.250
We should double our ad buy.

35:06.284 --> 35:08.051
- No.
- <i>Are you crazy?</i>

35:08.086 --> 35:10.554
Tina, don't fucking
touch that money, okay?

35:16.160 --> 35:18.661
Three cheers for sisterhood.

35:18.696 --> 35:21.064
<i>Stop.</i>

35:21.098 --> 35:23.199
Hey, what are you doing?

35:23.233 --> 35:26.469
I told you I am not stopping
working to eat with you.

35:26.503 --> 35:28.905
I just need a minute
of uninterrupted privacy.

35:31.608 --> 35:33.576
I sent Rosebud in for testing.

35:33.610 --> 35:35.979
Shit cost a fucking fortune
for the rush job

35:36.014 --> 35:37.982
and the shit still
came back inconclusive.

35:38.017 --> 35:41.387
Partial print,
generic block handwriting.

35:41.421 --> 35:44.524
I'm not going on record, okay?
I don't even know myself.

35:44.558 --> 35:46.126
No, I'm not asking you to.

35:46.160 --> 35:48.762
Just the guy at the lab said the
only way to go is DNA testing

35:48.796 --> 35:50.363
and I need something
to compare it against.

35:52.900 --> 35:55.869
Sam, I didn't even know
the guy's birthday.

35:56.653 --> 35:58.304
You don't have a memo pad

35:58.338 --> 36:00.506
or, like, a fucking pen?

36:00.540 --> 36:05.044
The mayor's closest aide
leaks damning documents

36:05.079 --> 36:06.746
then turns up dead.

36:06.780 --> 36:08.414
That doesn't bother you?

36:08.449 --> 36:10.216
- You don't know that for sure.
- Come on.

36:11.719 --> 36:14.121
How do we always end up back here?

36:14.156 --> 36:16.124
You tell me.

36:16.158 --> 36:18.526
You're right.
I should have kept my mouth shut.

36:18.561 --> 36:20.895
Look, I get it.
You're exposed here, but...

36:23.229 --> 36:24.866
Don'you want to know the truth?

36:55.897 --> 36:57.765
Can I buy you another?

36:59.000 --> 37:01.035
Claire Mann.

37:03.238 --> 37:04.972
That's quite a dress.

37:05.007 --> 37:06.674
Or maybe you've had enough.

37:08.677 --> 37:10.244
Not nearly.

37:16.186 --> 37:19.388
We're dropping all charges.

37:22.492 --> 37:24.460
Got spanked?

37:24.494 --> 37:26.828
You made good points.

37:26.863 --> 37:29.397
I took them to Doyle and he agreed.

37:32.568 --> 37:34.335
You had to get all fancy
to tell me that?

37:34.369 --> 37:36.670
Gala for Hubbard Street.

37:38.406 --> 37:40.507
Could have called.

37:42.176 --> 37:44.644
Figured I owed you an apology.

37:44.679 --> 37:46.213
In person.

37:49.584 --> 37:51.418
What do you want?

37:51.453 --> 37:52.954
No, I mean it.

37:52.988 --> 37:55.056
I like to argue.

37:55.090 --> 37:58.325
Or, I like to win, rather.

37:58.360 --> 38:01.294
I hit below the belt with you.

38:01.329 --> 38:03.963
I feel bad about it.

38:04.965 --> 38:06.599
Ain't beanbag.

38:06.633 --> 38:09.201
You're giving up?

38:12.940 --> 38:15.208
She's divorcing me.

38:15.242 --> 38:18.712
Lesser men have come back
from greater scandal.

38:20.748 --> 38:23.617
You've got a knack
at finding the sweet spot

38:23.651 --> 38:26.286
between sincerity

38:26.321 --> 38:29.289
and what's politically useful.

38:32.660 --> 38:34.694
You'll be fine.

38:41.135 --> 38:43.269
What do you want?

39:14.905 --> 39:16.639
You were fucking incredible.

39:16.673 --> 39:18.707
I get that a lot.

39:18.742 --> 39:21.077
You're humble, too.

39:21.111 --> 39:23.412
<i>That, not so much.</i>

39:25.281 --> 39:27.049
<i>You got somewhere else to be?</i>

39:27.083 --> 39:30.119
Home.
Big day tomorrow.

39:30.154 --> 39:31.721
Yeah?

39:31.755 --> 39:33.890
We served Kane with subpoenas.

39:33.924 --> 39:36.525
Expecting the files in the morning.

39:36.560 --> 39:38.761
Doyle subpoenaed Kane?

39:38.795 --> 39:40.262
What, does he hate
his job or something?

39:40.297 --> 39:43.465
He doesn't need the mayor's support.

39:43.500 --> 39:46.701
I didn't realize Doyle's
organization was so formidable.

39:48.571 --> 39:50.839
Speaking of formidable.

40:00.150 --> 40:01.684
Night, Ben.

40:35.485 --> 40:37.319
This is it.

40:37.353 --> 40:39.487
One time.
She's clear, right?

40:41.257 --> 40:42.557
Right?

40:42.592 --> 40:44.259
Long as she keeps pissing
clean we're cool.

40:44.293 --> 40:46.461
Otherwise it's another five K.

40:46.496 --> 40:47.663
Like that.

41:19.930 --> 41:21.330
I dealt with Babe.

41:23.067 --> 41:26.469
We'll need to move quickly before he
becomes aware your plans have changed.

41:26.504 --> 41:27.704
Demolition's in motion.

41:27.739 --> 41:29.706
Won't be more than
a couple of weeks now.

41:29.741 --> 41:32.343
- And Mona?
- What about her?

41:34.012 --> 41:37.114
Without a clear future
in place for the Gardens

41:37.149 --> 41:39.717
I expect she'll resist,

41:39.751 --> 41:41.552
attached as she is to its fate.

41:41.587 --> 41:44.188
I have her under control.

41:44.223 --> 41:46.224
Did he make things
difficult... McGantry?

41:46.258 --> 41:48.793
It was as expected.

41:53.099 --> 41:56.168
I should never have compromised you.

42:11.920 --> 42:13.721
One, two, three, four,

42:13.755 --> 42:15.689
throw those racists out the door!

42:15.723 --> 42:17.357
Five, six, seven, eight,

42:17.392 --> 42:19.192
we will not discriminate!

42:19.227 --> 42:21.628
I hate that it's come to this.

42:21.663 --> 42:24.798
I did what I could to protect you,
but things being what they are...

42:24.832 --> 42:26.867
You know that call was doctored.

42:26.901 --> 42:28.736
Everything was taken out of context.

42:28.770 --> 42:31.305
I know.
I know.

42:31.339 --> 42:34.741
There are many things I can control.

42:34.776 --> 42:38.177
Unfortunately for both of us,
the media is not one of them.

42:39.780 --> 42:42.215
I wanted to have
this private farewell

42:42.249 --> 42:46.052
so you know how grateful I am
for your many years of service.

42:46.086 --> 42:48.921
Once I step in front
of those cameras...

42:48.956 --> 42:51.090
Yeah, I know how the songs ends.

42:52.793 --> 42:55.295
I'll ensure that you're
well taken care of.

42:55.329 --> 42:58.464
Full pension. And, of course,
if there's anything you need,

42:58.498 --> 43:00.599
please don't hesitate to ask.

43:02.202 --> 43:04.437
Maybe we can find time
to take in that Cubs game.

43:04.471 --> 43:07.173
They're not looking
too good this year.

43:24.490 --> 43:26.691
It is with a heavy heart that
I stand here before you today.

43:26.725 --> 43:28.960
I've asked for and received

43:28.994 --> 43:31.062
Superintendent Royczyk's resignation.

43:31.097 --> 43:34.199
His response to the death
of Jerome Mathis

43:34.233 --> 43:36.367
cannot be ignored or tolerated.

43:36.402 --> 43:39.371
I want to assure all of Chicago
that I am committed

43:39.405 --> 43:42.875
to purging such attitudes
from our civic institutions.

43:42.909 --> 43:46.278
I hope this speeds the healing
process for us all,

43:46.313 --> 43:49.882
especially the family
of Jerome Mathis.

43:49.916 --> 43:51.716
Thank you.

43:58.358 --> 44:01.226
<i>In response to mounting</i>
<i>pressure from citizens</i>

44:01.261 --> 44:02.594
<i>and civil rights groups,</i>

44:02.629 --> 44:04.628
<i>Superintendent James Royczyk</i>
<i>stepped down today</i>

44:04.629 --> 44:09.400
<i>after 15 years at the post.</i>
<i>This ends his 33-year long career...</i>

44:10.931 --> 44:13.990
Disappointing that it
had to come to this.

44:15.024 --> 44:17.788
We're going ahead with
demolition of the Gardens.

44:17.823 --> 44:19.522
Gave the contract to Ortiz.

44:19.556 --> 44:22.420
We'll worry about
replacing Y&M down the road.

44:22.455 --> 44:24.186
Is that all?

44:24.220 --> 44:26.052
Yes.

44:36.814 --> 44:40.810
Neither of us were under any
illusions when I was hired.

44:40.844 --> 44:42.975
I didn't expect much from you

44:43.009 --> 44:45.773
and you knew exactly why I was here.

44:45.807 --> 44:48.905
But you made promises.

44:48.939 --> 44:51.870
You made promises in my name.

44:51.904 --> 44:53.935
And if you're gonna
go back on them now,

44:53.970 --> 44:56.568
I would appreciate
the respect of being informed

44:56.603 --> 44:58.133
before the shit hits the fan.

44:58.168 --> 45:00.099
Sit.

45:10.727 --> 45:13.225
I won't be scolded, sir.

45:24.420 --> 45:26.683
I hired you for all
the wrong reasons.

45:26.717 --> 45:29.681
You knew that, yet here you are.

45:29.716 --> 45:32.780
You knew how long the odds were,

45:32.815 --> 45:34.713
and yet you played.

45:34.747 --> 45:37.579
I envy you.

45:37.614 --> 45:40.577
After 20 years behind this desk,

45:40.612 --> 45:42.975
I've lost sight

45:43.009 --> 45:44.974
of why I started.

45:46.542 --> 45:48.540
And now here you are,

45:48.574 --> 45:51.438
a constant reminder.

45:52.870 --> 45:54.236
I'm no idealist.

45:54.270 --> 45:57.401
No, you're a realist

45:57.435 --> 45:59.433
who holds out hope.

46:04.497 --> 46:07.927
I don't know what lies ahead,

46:07.961 --> 46:11.692
but I promise
you won't be blindsided.

46:12.892 --> 46:14.559
Thank you.

46:21.357 --> 46:23.355
You can go.

46:29.086 --> 46:32.350
I believe you're all
familiar with Senator Walsh.

46:32.385 --> 46:33.949
You've already met everyone else.

46:33.983 --> 46:36.415
Almost.
Kitty O'Neil.

46:36.449 --> 46:38.613
Trey Rogers.
Pleasure.

46:38.647 --> 46:41.711
Thank you, Alderman Ross
for arranging this meeting.

46:41.746 --> 46:45.344
And for helping me to understand

46:45.378 --> 46:47.842
the struggles your communities face

46:47.876 --> 46:51.441
Clearly disenfranchising your
vote is no way to confront them.

46:51.476 --> 46:53.240
Excuse me, Senator.

46:53.274 --> 46:56.339
No disrespect, but I believe
we all know why we're here.

46:56.373 --> 46:58.238
Why don't we skip the politicking

46:58.273 --> 47:01.003
and get to the numbers?
Agreed?

47:01.037 --> 47:04.567
Well, I can guarantee you
5,500 votes out of the 21st.

47:04.602 --> 47:08.433
Coming mostly from the surrounding
precincts around the Gardens.

47:08.468 --> 47:11.565
Would have been more
but for our recent exodus.

47:11.599 --> 47:12.998
Walking around money?

47:13.032 --> 47:16.031
A discounted rate of 95,000.

47:16.065 --> 47:17.497
Antoine?

47:17.531 --> 47:19.696
Well, we've got a lot
of sporadics in the 23rd.

47:19.730 --> 47:21.528
Made progress last aldermanic race,

47:21.562 --> 47:23.760
but I don't want to overpromise.

47:23.794 --> 47:26.792
I'm confident we can guarantee
3,700, but it could be more.

47:26.826 --> 47:29.157
We're looking at 75 thou,

47:29.192 --> 47:32.256
<i>but I'd like to reserve</i>
<i>the right to renegotiate.</i>

47:32.290 --> 47:34.754
Of course.
Maurice?

47:34.788 --> 47:36.220
So what do you think?

47:36.255 --> 47:39.817
<i>Like I said, between 3,700 and 4,075.</i>

47:39.852 --> 47:41.750
<i>If I go over 4,000</i>
<i>I got to charge more.</i>

47:41.784 --> 47:43.482
No, but let's not fuck around here.

47:43.516 --> 47:44.915
- Let's just be realistic.
- <i>Kitty. Kitty.</i>

47:44.949 --> 47:46.480
- No, the reality is...
- Wait a minute.

47:46.515 --> 47:48.081
You're asking him to go
all the way down to 71st

47:48.115 --> 47:49.913
all the way over to the shore, okay?

47:49.948 --> 47:52.745
Right, but the reality
is that doesn't work for us.

47:52.779 --> 47:56.909
Now you told me 3,500,
you delivered 2,500.

47:56.943 --> 47:58.507
<i>Right, right.</i>

47:58.541 --> 48:00.973
At the same time, sir,

48:01.008 --> 48:03.504
<i>let's allow this association</i>
<i>to have some longevity.</i>

48:03.539 --> 48:07.071
No possible way because
we're not going above 60.

48:10.056 --> 48:11.106
It's doable.

48:11.110 --> 48:13.450
I didn't know you were
so flush, Catherine.

48:13.484 --> 48:16.152
Plenty left over
for your finder's fee.

48:17.387 --> 48:18.988
Thank you for your time, gentlemen.

48:19.023 --> 48:21.391
Delivery will be made
through the usual channel.

48:21.893 --> 48:23.291
Thank you.

48:25.396 --> 48:27.063
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

48:27.097 --> 48:30.032
Even with diligent
redaction you're exposed.

48:30.066 --> 48:32.801
We can petition for a narrower scope.

48:32.836 --> 48:35.404
Not a judge around who wouldn't
agree this is excessive.

49:20.484 --> 49:21.751
Send it all.

49:21.785 --> 49:23.686
<i>Motherfucking cocksucking</i>

49:23.720 --> 49:27.089
piece of shit asshole!

49:27.124 --> 49:29.025
This is some old school bullshit.

49:29.059 --> 49:30.593
This is a year's worth of work.
Maybe two.

49:35.499 --> 49:38.400
Well, this one's not
a complete disaster.

49:43.640 --> 49:47.143
And look at that,
not a word redacted.

49:53.316 --> 49:56.285
Mr. Hoffman, lan Todd
from the mayor's office.

49:56.320 --> 49:59.088
I understand you have some
concerns with Emma Kane.

50:05.663 --> 50:07.864
All right.

50:09.300 --> 50:11.934
Well, listen, in the future,

50:11.969 --> 50:14.904
should any problems arise, I'd like
to be the first call you make.

50:14.938 --> 50:17.139
Thank you.

50:18.741 --> 50:21.744
Huge coup you pulled today.

50:21.778 --> 50:25.581
You wanted Cook County,
I got you Cook County,

50:25.615 --> 50:28.184
Tough to get in bed
with those people, though.

50:28.218 --> 50:32.454
Well, their crimes are just
less socially acceptable

50:32.489 --> 50:35.024
than say McGantry's.

50:35.058 --> 50:37.560
It's all the same shit, though.

50:37.594 --> 50:39.295
Thank you.

50:39.329 --> 50:41.497
<i>Just doing my job, ma'am.</i>

50:41.531 --> 50:44.000
Brilliantly.

50:44.034 --> 50:48.337
Look, I don't want
to stir the pot, but...

50:48.372 --> 50:51.974
Tina, she didn't back this move.

50:52.008 --> 50:55.944
In fact, she hasn't backed
any move I've tried to make.

50:55.978 --> 50:59.079
Let me worry about Tina.

50:59.114 --> 51:01.282
I'm gonna head up.

51:01.316 --> 51:03.684
We're downstate the rest of the week,

51:03.718 --> 51:05.819
so I won't see you for a while.

51:05.854 --> 51:07.988
Okay, I'll be in touch.

51:34.548 --> 51:36.449
Ma'am.

51:36.483 --> 51:37.984
You forgot this.

51:44.858 --> 51:46.058
Sleep well.

51:47.294 --> 51:49.161
You, too.

52:05.445 --> 52:08.214
- Ian.
- Hey.

52:08.248 --> 52:10.883
- I was hoping I'd...
- Thank you.

52:12.352 --> 52:13.853
I didn't do anything,
but you're welcome.

52:13.887 --> 52:15.455
What do you mean?
He stopped calling.

52:15.489 --> 52:18.191
Must have been some confusion.
He said there was no problem.

52:18.225 --> 52:21.027
Really.

52:24.999 --> 52:28.035
Do you need to get that?

52:29.638 --> 52:32.840
Well, thanks anyway
for making the effort.

52:32.874 --> 52:35.876
I meant it, anything you need.

52:47.923 --> 52:49.724
Um, good night.

52:51.258 --> 52:52.493
Good night.

52:56.599 --> 52:58.399
This isn't just off the record.

52:58.434 --> 53:00.302
It's not even deep background.

53:00.337 --> 53:02.072
You've got to find your own proof

53:02.106 --> 53:03.573
'cause I'll deny this ever happened.

53:03.608 --> 53:05.208
I'll take whatever you can give.

53:05.243 --> 53:08.411
City Hall town car went
missing same time Kane did.

53:08.446 --> 53:11.715
Crossed over into Canada
at the I-94 border

53:11.750 --> 53:13.951
at 11:47 P.M. Tuesday.

53:15.453 --> 53:17.621
Wait, was Kane driving?

53:34.939 --> 53:36.974
About fucking time.

53:46.851 --> 53:48.819
<i>Come in.</i>

53:49.854 --> 53:52.489
Meredith, have you seen my...

53:57.695 --> 53:59.296
You're in bed early.

53:59.330 --> 54:01.632
I wasn't feeling very well.

54:01.666 --> 54:04.100
Come. Sit.

54:13.846 --> 54:16.681
I was in need of guidance
while you were gone.

54:18.884 --> 54:22.587
I took the liberty of exploring
the contents of your computer.

54:30.496 --> 54:32.764
There are dozens of these.

54:32.799 --> 54:35.567
As well as more...

54:37.136 --> 54:39.404
intimate moments.

54:39.439 --> 54:41.906
All of them saved.

54:41.941 --> 54:45.777
None of them containing information
pertinent to your office.

54:55.555 --> 54:57.823
Are you in love with her?

55:01.929 --> 55:04.364
Just obsessed?

55:09.236 --> 55:10.870
I can't fire her.

55:12.205 --> 55:13.606
Wouldn't look good.

55:13.657 --> 55:16.243
<i>For the moment, at least.</i>

55:16.277 --> 55:18.979
But if you could,

55:20.514 --> 55:21.814
would you?

55:28.690 --> 55:32.160
I'll admit there was an attachment.

55:33.696 --> 55:36.631
But it was the disease.

55:36.665 --> 55:40.402
<i>Now that I'm renewed,</i>
<i>I see her role clearly.</i>

55:43.272 --> 55:45.574
You know, I'm concerned
that you're pushing

55:45.608 --> 55:47.242
too hard too fast.

55:54.852 --> 55:56.452
No.

55:57.486 --> 55:59.022
<i>But what about you?</i>

55:59.056 --> 56:01.591
With all that's gone on,
we haven't even

56:01.625 --> 56:04.260
had the opportunity to talk

56:04.294 --> 56:06.596
about your treatment.

56:07.899 --> 56:10.266
You seem confident it was effective.

56:12.519 --> 56:14.204
Confidence.

56:16.241 --> 56:18.174
It cuts both ways.

56:25.666 --> 56:27.817
Tell me.

56:31.222 --> 56:33.557
What did you see in your hallucinations?

56:38.096 --> 56:40.330
Ezra.

56:41.464 --> 56:42.799
Your father.

56:43.333 --> 56:45.101
History rewritten.

56:45.136 --> 56:46.036
Creatures.

56:47.071 --> 56:49.606
<i>So many voices.</i>

56:51.275 --> 56:53.677
<i>The din drowned out all reason.</i>

56:53.711 --> 56:56.246
<i>I tried.</i>
<i>I tried on my own</i>

56:56.980 --> 56:59.783
<i>to silence it,</i>
<i>but it only grew louder.</i>

57:01.152 --> 57:02.786
<i>Deafening.</i>

57:27.279 --> 57:29.814
<i>But it's quiet now.</i>

57:30.816 --> 57:33.018
<i>My mind is still.</i>

57:33.802 --> 57:35.155
<i>My thoughts</i>

57:36.502 --> 57:37.655
<i>clear.</i>

57:37.656 --> 57:38.957
<i>Calm.</i>
