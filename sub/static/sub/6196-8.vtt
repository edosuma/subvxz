I'm not Suze Orman,
but I did read her book

03:57.551 --> 03:58.802
and she's got a lot of great ideas.

03:58.803 --> 04:00.512
- And I'm sure we're about to hear them.
- Yes, you are.

04:00.513 --> 04:02.514
Since now you and Niecy both have jobs,

04:02.515 --> 04:04.516
we can finally start applying
some of Suze's principles.

04:04.517 --> 04:05.934
Hmm.

04:05.935 --> 04:07.727
She's rich and White,
so you know it works.

04:07.728 --> 04:09.562
Oh, ho, ho.

04:09.563 --> 04:11.023
So, in her book,

04:11.024 --> 04:12.607
Suze talks about this woman who

04:12.608 --> 04:14.317
built her family's wealth, right?

04:14.318 --> 04:17.236
So, using our family as an example,

04:17.237 --> 04:20.515
let's say Niecy needed
to borrow money, right?

04:21.116 --> 04:22.909
But she didn't pay it back.

04:22.910 --> 04:25.286
So, the next person who
needs to borrow money,

04:25.287 --> 04:27.914
like say, Patrick,
let's keep it realistic,

04:27.915 --> 04:30.083
- has to go to Niecy to ask for the money.
- Oh!

04:30.084 --> 04:31.877
What? Borrow money from Niecy?

04:31.878 --> 04:33.503
- NIECY: Um...
- MARY JANE: Yeah, yeah.

04:33.504 --> 04:35.922
You see how that's sort of
promoting communal accountability?

04:35.923 --> 04:38.158
- Hmm. Hmm.
- Right, right?

04:38.300 --> 04:39.534
NIECY: Whatever.

04:40.386 --> 04:42.846
I just want a car. That's it.

04:42.847 --> 04:45.473
No, no, no, no, Niecy. See,
that's a short-term goal.

04:45.474 --> 04:47.642
That's just a short-term
goal. See? Okay.

04:47.643 --> 04:51.938
As a matter of fact, I say we
have a family homework assignment.

04:51.939 --> 04:53.606
Okay, right,

04:53.607 --> 04:56.401
where we come up with a
mission statement as a family

04:56.402 --> 05:00.780
and we brainstorm ideas of
financial security and...

05:00.781 --> 05:03.533
And then we come up
with like a family pot

05:03.534 --> 05:07.286
that we can use in times
of trouble or crisis

05:07.287 --> 05:09.706
so it, you know, doesn't
fall on me, right?

05:09.707 --> 05:11.499
Again, it's... It's like, um,

05:11.500 --> 05:15.904
really just preaching communal
accountability, right, as a family.

05:20.467 --> 05:22.495

09:27.840 --> 09:30.424
People's mistakes, and
indiscretions and... And...

09:30.425 --> 09:32.718
And rumors, gossip,

09:32.719 --> 09:35.347
that's way more important
than real issues and the truth.

09:35.348 --> 09:38.224
That's why everyone in this classroom

09:38.225 --> 09:41.545
is obsessed with blogs and tabloids,

09:42.896 --> 09:45.481
because that's what
we've been conditioned

09:45.482 --> 09:47.300
to think is important.

09:48.235 --> 09:51.221
That's the current
climate of this industry.

09:52.406 --> 09:54.224
Wait, so how'd you get around that?

09:56.076 --> 09:58.161
Branding.

09:58.162 --> 10:00.246
You've gotta figure out what appeals

10:00.247 --> 10:02.999
to the viewer, right?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.793
This is precisely why Kim
Kardashian has a voice.

- That's why North West

10:07.380 --> 10:09.005
has a bigger voice than the President.

10:09.006 --> 10:10.882
No, the Kim K. Analogy

10:10.883 --> 10:12.466
- doesn't apply to you.
- Why not?

10:12.467 --> 10:14.219
Because when you gave up TalkBACK for

10:14.220 --> 10:15.594
Prime Time to brand yourself,

10:15.595 --> 10:17.581
you lost your voice.

10:18.640 --> 10:22.560
I mean, seeing your Black face up there

10:22.561 --> 10:25.313
validates these bandwagon stories

10:25.314 --> 10:27.273
and contributes to a culture of

10:27.274 --> 10:29.401
fear-based news and, honestly,

10:29.402 --> 10:31.303
it makes the problem even worse.

10:32.905 --> 10:34.264

11:11.318 --> 11:12.485
<i>I see what you're saying,</i>

11:12.486 --> 11:15.029
<i>that society just
turns on our sons.</i>

11:15.030 --> 11:18.241
<i>I mean, one minute, he's this
cute little boy and everybody...</i>

11:18.242 --> 11:21.953
<i>I mean White, stopped me just to tell
me how cute and adorable my son is.</i>

11:21.954 --> 11:23.480
But, now...

11:23.747 --> 11:25.331
Now it's like,

11:25.332 --> 11:27.500
you know, they're not quite
grabbing their purses yet,

11:27.501 --> 11:29.794
but they just don't
smile at him anymore.

11:29.795 --> 11:32.130
They look at him like
he's going to do something.

11:32.131 --> 11:34.924
You know, you can literally see them
turning on him, making him a criminal,

11:34.925 --> 11:36.342
like they're so scared of him,

11:36.343 --> 11:38.428
but I'm the one who's scared.

11:38.429 --> 11:41.139
You see, my son is only ten

11:41.140 --> 11:43.891
and, to them, he's already
becoming public enemy number one.

11:43.892 --> 11:45.335
Help!

11:45.644 --> 11:46.811
What do I do?

11:46.812 --> 11:48.771
Like if there's one thing I can master

11:48.772 --> 11:50.632
that can help him, what is it?

11:50.941 --> 11:52.926
How do I protect my son?

11:54.820 --> 11:57.696
Part of the answer is
how do we protect him?

11:57.697 --> 12:02.494
We have to understand that we live
in a highly White supremacist society.

12:02.495 --> 12:05.788
White people do not have
to think about being White.

12:05.789 --> 12:09.667
Being White is accepted, privileged.

12:09.668 --> 12:12.504
But being Black is not
the opposite of White.

12:12.505 --> 12:15.047
Being Black, we have our own definition.

12:15.048 --> 12:18.384
And we did not come here first
class on American Airlines.

12:18.385 --> 12:20.553
There's a whole history there.

12:20.554 --> 12:23.722
So, what your son needs, and what
you need, and what we all need,

12:23.723 --> 12:25.724
is an understanding
of that relationship.

12:25.725 --> 12:28.686
And then within the context
of that, build a culture,

12:28.687 --> 12:31.063
a positive culture that will
allow us to continue to grow

12:31.064 --> 12:32.982
and to develop.

12:32.983 --> 12:35.693
So, it requires in many
cases, changes from all of us,

12:35.694 --> 12:37.529
men and women.

12:37.530 --> 12:40.323
But the key point is, that now,

12:40.324 --> 12:43.701
we're on a mission to make
sure that he's loved and secure

12:43.702 --> 12:45.812
and he's on a learning
path toward tomorrow.

12:48.248 --> 12:51.625
You know, Dr. Madhubuti, I've
been chewing on a thought.

12:51.626 --> 12:54.379
I think that we, as a Black
community, need to start using

12:54.380 --> 12:57.590
the word "boy" for our boys.

12:57.591 --> 13:00.468
Because of our history
as slaves in this country,

13:00.469 --> 13:04.305
I know that a lot of people do not
like to address their boys as "boys."

13:04.306 --> 13:05.723
They, instead, want to say little man,

13:05.724 --> 13:07.350
but they're not little men.

13:07.351 --> 13:09.101
I mean, they're children...

13:09.102 --> 13:10.562
See? Even I can't say it.

13:10.563 --> 13:14.690
They're boys and girls and we
should at least see them as such.

13:14.691 --> 13:17.026
It's like we need a marketing campaign

13:17.027 --> 13:19.737
to give them back their childhood.

13:19.738 --> 13:23.074
That's true and the marketing
campaign starts with us.

13:23.075 --> 13:25.159
It starts with you. It starts
with your extended family,

13:25.160 --> 13:27.061
your biological family also.

13:27.329 --> 13:28.913
The boy, himself,

13:28.914 --> 13:30.789
must understand that
he's not only a boy,

13:30.790 --> 13:34.210
but whatever his name is,
it must be his name, too.

13:34.211 --> 13:37.088
And we all have to
address him by his name.

13:37.089 --> 13:38.839
But because he's so young,

13:38.840 --> 13:41.926
he does not understand
the larger picture.

13:41.927 --> 13:44.387
And, so, the larger
picture starts in the home.

13:44.388 --> 13:45.513
What do you have in your home?

13:45.514 --> 13:47.181
What kind of images do
you have on your wall?

13:47.182 --> 13:48.974
What kind of books are you reading?

13:48.975 --> 13:50.976
What kind of music are you listening to?

13:50.977 --> 13:53.812
What's on the walls
in his room, you see?

13:53.813 --> 13:57.316
So we have to kind of
bring the culture to him

13:57.317 --> 13:59.902
and make sure there are very few
contradictions in that culture,

13:59.903 --> 14:03.056
which requires us to
study, study, study.

14:04.450 --> 14:06.200
CECE: So, you've never
even heard of his work?

14:06.201 --> 14:08.202
No, of course, I was
familiar with his work.

14:08.203 --> 14:11.122
I just hadn't read all of his books yet.

14:11.123 --> 14:14.166
That's because of all that White
schooling you've been getting.

14:14.167 --> 14:16.586
Oh, here we go.

14:16.587 --> 14:18.588
You know, when the White
man wants to control you,

14:18.589 --> 14:21.574
he's not gonna give you the
tools to control yourself.

14:23.594 --> 14:25.928
If you want any of his books,
you should get that one,

You don't seem too happy about it.

14:43.697 --> 14:45.573
- Do you think I'm a sell out?
- Oh!

14:45.574 --> 14:48.493
(LAUGHS) One thing at a time.

14:48.494 --> 14:49.785
I was sitting in a class,

14:49.786 --> 14:51.787
a journalism class at Clark, right,

14:51.788 --> 14:53.872
and come to find out

14:53.873 --> 14:56.083
most of the students think I'm
more concerned with being famous

14:56.084 --> 14:57.793
than reporting the news.

14:57.794 --> 15:00.113
Yeah. They're right.

15:01.298 --> 15:04.216
You prefer things and not value,

15:04.217 --> 15:07.136
especially not doing anything
for anybody besides yourself.

15:07.137 --> 15:08.513
No, but I do the news,

15:08.514 --> 15:10.889
and I try to cover stories
that actually make a difference,

15:10.890 --> 15:12.933
especially to our community,
and you see what happens.

15:12.934 --> 15:15.353
- Well, I thought it worked.
- No, they don't.

15:15.354 --> 15:18.147
Black episodes, those
are my lowest rated.

15:18.148 --> 15:20.733
Not to mention the constant
battles and the fights.

15:20.734 --> 15:22.527
At some point, you just get tired.

15:22.528 --> 15:25.571
So, when they offered me
a promotion, it felt good.

15:25.572 --> 15:28.767
Well, if it's so good, then
why are you so defensive?

15:33.079 --> 15:35.440
Mary Jane, what do you want?

15:37.250 --> 15:38.459
Financial freedom.

15:38.460 --> 15:40.503
You got that, so stop whining.

15:40.504 --> 15:41.879
No, I don't, actually.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.673
So, what are you doing with your money?

15:43.674 --> 15:46.592
Bills and family, extortion.

15:46.593 --> 15:49.704
Look, don't start pointing fingers
because I'm trying to help you out.

15:51.890 --> 15:53.891
This is my life?

15:53.892 --> 15:55.476
I mean, seriously, is
this gonna be my life?

15:55.477 --> 15:57.269
One obstacle after another?

15:57.270 --> 15:59.564
Just... My life.

15:59.565 --> 16:01.607
Mary Jane, I think you're
just missing the freedom

16:01.608 --> 16:03.067
you had when you were doing TalkBACK

16:03.068 --> 16:05.137
and just don't know
how to get back there.

16:06.863 --> 16:08.614
In a weird way, I think
maybe you're right.

16:08.615 --> 16:10.199
Well, what's weird about that?

16:10.200 --> 16:12.936
Because it's less money
and it's less billboards.

16:15.455 --> 16:17.273
I'm sure you want your money.

16:19.084 --> 16:20.292
There you go.

16:20.293 --> 16:22.336
Oh, the last payment.

16:22.337 --> 16:24.463

16:24.464 --> 16:26.173

- Okay.

16:26.174 --> 16:27.883
Well, well, now...

16:27.884 --> 16:29.635
(CHUCKLES) Should we hug it out?

16:29.636 --> 16:30.969
- It's over.
- No.

16:30.970 --> 16:32.263
(LAUGHS) Okay.

16:32.264 --> 16:33.514

19:50.963 --> 19:52.170
wait to pass with flying colors,

19:52.171 --> 19:55.215
we can nibble on those.

19:55.216 --> 19:57.618
They're the appetizer
before the main feast.

19:58.428 --> 19:59.637
The citrus is for you.

KARA: <i>Stop! Wait a minute.
No. You... You are lying.</i>

22:18.110 --> 22:20.945
I only have a few minutes before my
training and I've gotta hear this.

22:20.946 --> 22:23.447
You are telling me that you have never

22:23.448 --> 22:25.991
ever, ever, ever, been with a White boy?

22:25.992 --> 22:28.077
- Never. Ever.
- Seriously?

22:28.078 --> 22:29.854
- Oh, my God.
- Uh-uh.

22:30.538 --> 22:31.956
Wow. (LAUGHS)

22:31.957 --> 22:34.150
Okay, all right, all right. Well...

22:34.751 --> 22:35.834
Well, what did you think?

22:35.835 --> 22:37.169
It was pink.

22:37.170 --> 22:39.212
- Really?
- Mmm-hm. Unusually pink.

22:39.213 --> 22:41.924
I guess I haven't been with
that many of them, but okay.

22:41.925 --> 22:45.886
Well, have you ever seen like a
picture of one or a movie or something?

22:45.887 --> 22:48.847
Yes, like, you know, pictures.
Like National Geographic.

22:48.848 --> 22:53.018
But, no, not like live-action
White penis movement, no.

22:53.019 --> 22:55.228
I don't even watch White porn.

22:55.229 --> 22:57.898
Mmm-hmm, so Black porn
is bigger and better, huh?

22:57.899 --> 23:00.525
Lexington Steele, that's all
I'm gonna say. Google him.

23:00.526 --> 23:02.653
- You are so racist.
- I'm not racist.

23:02.654 --> 23:06.198
I just discriminate based on my personal
preference, not hatred, thank you.

23:06.199 --> 23:08.700
Mmm-hmm.

23:08.701 --> 23:11.078
Well, did the boy have a little
something goin' on down there or what?

23:11.079 --> 23:12.871
Like did he have like a package?

23:12.872 --> 23:14.498
He... He was cool, you know what I mean?

23:14.499 --> 23:16.500
He wasn't the biggest,
but he... He definitely

23:16.501 --> 23:19.003
exceeded my stereotypical expectations.

23:19.004 --> 23:20.171
- Oh. Nice.
- Mmm-hmm.

23:20.172 --> 23:22.173
- Yeah.
- Okay. Okay.

23:22.174 --> 23:24.424
- One stereotype that was true...
- Mmm-hmm?

23:24.425 --> 23:26.093
They do love to chomp the box

23:26.094 --> 23:28.179
- and you should have told me.
- Yes, they do.

23:28.180 --> 23:30.456
That's a good thing. (LAUGHS)

23:30.556 --> 23:32.124
I know!

23:35.895 --> 23:37.312
(RUNNING FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

23:37.313 --> 23:39.272
- I thought I was done with you.
- You are.

23:39.273 --> 23:41.483
But you were on my mind, so,

23:41.484 --> 23:43.735
I needed to come and get
some things off my chest.

23:43.736 --> 23:45.529
- I tried calling.
- I changed my number.

23:45.530 --> 23:48.032
I know that, which is why I'm here.

23:48.033 --> 23:49.867
Look, I gave you some bad advice

23:49.868 --> 23:53.954
and I simply came to offer you a
different, more reflective thought.

23:53.955 --> 23:55.731
Okay, what's that, Cece?

23:57.583 --> 24:00.377
Don't tear down to build.

24:00.378 --> 24:02.462
Look, I don't do riddles.
Come on, help me out.

24:02.463 --> 24:05.132
Don't go back to TalkBACK for
less money for your people.

24:05.133 --> 24:07.759
We don't need to tear down to build.

24:07.760 --> 24:09.511
Keep Prime Time,

24:09.512 --> 24:12.639
do their news, but ask them for TalkBACK

24:12.640 --> 24:14.141
and do that show in a way you want.

24:14.142 --> 24:15.684
Ask for both.

24:15.685 --> 24:18.729
We need you on Prime Time
because that's progress,

24:18.730 --> 24:22.691
and our babies need to see
winners in all walks of life,

24:22.692 --> 24:25.261
even if they are screwin' White boys.

24:27.197 --> 24:30.032
How long have you been
sitting outside my house?

24:30.033 --> 24:32.367
I just was trying to catch
you before you went to work.

24:32.368 --> 24:35.453
I'd hate to see you do something
stupid on account of me.

24:35.454 --> 24:37.148
Hey, that's all I wanted,

24:37.456 --> 24:40.125
a clear conscience.

24:40.126 --> 24:44.755
Oh, I got some kids' authors
coming by the store for story time,

24:44.756 --> 24:47.450
if you want to bring your
little nephew and nieces.

24:50.053 --> 24:52.137
Don't come back, Cece.

24:52.138 --> 24:53.831
I'm serious. I'll call the Cops.

24:57.685 --> 24:59.629
(ENGINE STARTS)

25:02.899 --> 25:04.275
NISCHELLE: You played a significant role

25:04.276 --> 25:05.859
in President Clinton's election,

25:05.860 --> 25:09.654
along with 83 percent of
Black voters who voted for him.

25:09.655 --> 25:12.574
Some people even touted him
as the first Black President.

25:12.575 --> 25:14.034
- (LAUGHS) Yes.
- Now,

25:14.035 --> 25:16.703
can we put this debate
to bed once and for all?

25:16.704 --> 25:20.540
Donna Brazile, who was
the first Black President?

25:20.541 --> 25:23.252
The novelist Toni
Morrison, suggested that

25:23.253 --> 25:25.462
Bill Clinton was the
first Black President

25:25.463 --> 25:26.964
because of the way he was being treated,

25:26.965 --> 25:29.007
being persecuted by his opponents.

25:29.008 --> 25:30.301
But eight years later,

25:30.302 --> 25:32.261
the distinction went to Barack Obama.

25:32.262 --> 25:33.637
He is America's first Black President.

25:33.638 --> 25:35.013
MARY JANE: <i>I want the show back.</i>

25:35.014 --> 25:36.765
(LAUGHING) Okay, you know,

25:36.766 --> 25:38.892
you remind me of my wife

25:38.893 --> 25:40.894
and why I both want to divorce her

25:40.895 --> 25:42.938
and stay intrigued by her.

25:42.939 --> 25:46.900
And I think it should be an entire
hour of the interview format.

25:46.901 --> 25:48.568
Kara revamped Mark's show.

25:48.569 --> 25:51.989
It'll just look like SNC is
revamping the whole three hour block.

25:51.990 --> 25:53.865
You know, I only bring this up because,

25:53.866 --> 25:55.742
whether or not you agree,

25:55.743 --> 25:58.996
the fact is there are a lot
of Black voters out there

25:58.997 --> 26:01.873
who believe Hillary and
Bill threw Black people

26:01.874 --> 26:05.919
under the bus during her 2008
Primary battle against Obama,

26:05.920 --> 26:08.046
and a significant
moment in that campaign,

26:08.047 --> 26:10.174
and might I add, one that
a lot of African-Americans

26:10.175 --> 26:12.050
have never forgiven her for,

26:12.051 --> 26:13.468
was when she referred to

26:13.469 --> 26:16.429
Obama's declining support among

26:16.430 --> 26:19.350
"hard working Americans,
White Americans"

26:19.351 --> 26:22.477
and all of the insinuations
that that statement implies.

26:22.478 --> 26:24.437
So now here we are, eight years later,

26:24.438 --> 26:26.857
and she needs and wants our vote again.

26:26.858 --> 26:29.901
So, what does she need
to do to get it back?

26:29.902 --> 26:33.364
Well, first of all, Hillary
Clinton cannot inherit this vote.

26:33.365 --> 26:35.490
She has to earn the support of

26:35.491 --> 26:37.326
African-American voters and others.

26:37.327 --> 26:41.205
The votes that Barak Obama
achieved in 2008 and 2012,

26:41.206 --> 26:42.580
they're not transferrable.

26:42.581 --> 26:44.375
Hillary Clinton will
have to go out there

26:44.376 --> 26:46.626
and earn the support of every voter.

26:46.627 --> 26:48.503
And let me just say this,

26:48.504 --> 26:52.507
Hillary Clinton understands that it takes
more than a village to win a campaign.

26:52.508 --> 26:54.092
It takes a coalition
and the coalition that

26:54.093 --> 26:55.677
Barak Obama assembled,

26:55.678 --> 26:57.554
that's the coalition she's
gonna have to fight for.

26:57.555 --> 26:58.763
GREG: Why?

26:58.764 --> 26:59.806
Because I'll do a better job.

26:59.807 --> 27:01.599
Oh.

27:01.600 --> 27:04.186
And given the current climate of
America, we could use that time

27:04.187 --> 27:05.812
to explore the news through that prism.

27:05.813 --> 27:07.398
I mean, not to mention

27:07.399 --> 27:09.816
the African-American
audience's ratings gold, honey.

27:09.817 --> 27:12.319
It's a demographic we
could easily exploit,

27:12.320 --> 27:15.514
especially when we tackle the
hot button, emotional stuff.

27:22.830 --> 27:24.831
I got a bunch of empty
boxes from work today.

27:24.832 --> 27:26.583
So the packing party can begin.

27:26.584 --> 27:27.876
Can we start tonight?

27:27.877 --> 27:29.086
No, I'll get us started.

27:29.087 --> 27:30.571
You have school in the morning.

27:31.256 --> 27:32.256
You're gonna start tonight?

27:32.257 --> 27:33.699
Yeah, may as well.

27:34.717 --> 27:36.218
You're a ball of energy lately.

27:36.219 --> 27:37.719
(CHUCKLES) I have things to do.

27:37.720 --> 27:39.637
I'm gonna have my own room.

27:39.638 --> 27:41.598
- TRACY: That's nice.
- (GIGGLES)

27:41.599 --> 27:43.183
Daddy said we can paint my room purple.

27:43.184 --> 27:44.960
No, I said we'll see.

27:46.229 --> 27:48.046
A purple room would be pretty cool.

27:50.942 --> 27:53.010
Um... Um...

27:53.569 --> 27:55.554
- Please? Please?
- Nah... Um...

27:56.364 --> 27:57.822
- One wall, that's it.
- Yay!

27:57.823 --> 27:59.141
(CHUCKLES)

28:22.056 --> 28:24.099
What are you still doing here this late?

28:24.100 --> 28:25.959
Working on a little
something-something.

28:27.228 --> 28:29.046
Okay, what are you up to now?

28:29.563 --> 28:32.607
I asked Greg for TalkBACK back.

28:32.608 --> 28:34.859
- What?
- Yeah, I mean, I wanted to make sure it was

28:34.860 --> 28:37.237
you know, a hundred percent and
I'd worked out all the kinks before,

28:37.238 --> 28:38.447
you know, presented it to you.

28:38.448 --> 28:39.948
But...

28:39.949 --> 28:41.658
Greg, he sent me an email

28:41.659 --> 28:44.744
saying he loved the idea and he was
gonna run it by all the mucky-mucks.

28:44.745 --> 28:46.288
Whoa, whoa, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

28:46.289 --> 28:49.082
You're not talking about
quitting Prime Time, right?

28:49.083 --> 28:50.417
No, no, hell, no.

28:50.418 --> 28:52.236
- Okay.
- You don't tear down to build.

28:52.545 --> 28:54.087
What?

28:54.088 --> 28:55.964
I just miss doing all my TalkBACK stuff

28:55.965 --> 28:57.924
and with everything that's
going on in our country,

28:57.925 --> 29:01.428
I mean, imagine if we
had an hour-long show,

29:01.429 --> 29:04.348
you know, in the vein of how I
produced the Ugly Black Woman panel,

29:04.349 --> 29:06.683
but for Ferguson, or for Tamir Rice

29:06.684 --> 29:07.892
or for Eric Garner
or for Walter Scott...

29:07.893 --> 29:09.769
- Okay, I get it. I got you.
- For Buddy Ray...

29:09.770 --> 29:11.396
- I got it.
- We can change the game, baby.

29:11.397 --> 29:13.773
Mary Jane, okay, wait a minute.

29:13.774 --> 29:16.026
No, no, and I... I know
where you're headed.

29:16.027 --> 29:18.195
I want to include Latino
issues, as well, and...

29:18.196 --> 29:19.904
And women's issues,

29:19.905 --> 29:21.948
especially since we're bound to
have our first female President.

29:21.949 --> 29:24.993
Okay, mama, stop, stop, stop.

29:24.994 --> 29:26.520
Okay.

29:27.663 --> 29:29.373
First of all,

29:29.374 --> 29:30.832
I think it's great you want to do this.

29:30.833 --> 29:32.860
I really do, okay?

29:33.044 --> 29:34.653
But...

29:37.006 --> 29:39.632
You keep saying "we," Mary Jane,

29:39.633 --> 29:41.634
and I...

29:41.635 --> 29:43.845
I can't do this show
with you, honey, I can't.

29:43.846 --> 29:45.889
I... I've got Prime Time.

29:45.890 --> 29:48.016
I have to revamp Mark's show.

29:48.017 --> 29:52.045
I cannot possibly take on another
show and still be a mom to my kids.

29:53.064 --> 29:55.815
You just drop Mark's
show and come to us.

29:55.816 --> 29:58.109
Mary Jane, they reduced
the budget on TalkBACK.

29:58.110 --> 29:59.570
Even if I could,

29:59.571 --> 30:02.807
the producer fee is not
enough to make me go back.

30:02.990 --> 30:04.866
Besides,

30:04.867 --> 30:07.619
I love where we are right
now, I do, I love it.

30:07.620 --> 30:09.871
I love our friendship. It's great.

30:09.872 --> 30:12.483
I'm so freaking tired
of fighting on TalkBACK.

30:13.376 --> 30:15.068
You know what?

30:15.461 --> 30:17.754
You should produce this show.

30:17.755 --> 30:19.423
- I can't do this show without you.
- Yes, you can.

30:19.424 --> 30:22.300
No, I can't. I don't like...
I don't like anyone, okay?

30:22.301 --> 30:24.428
I only trust you, Kara.

30:24.429 --> 30:26.304
- That's it.
- I know. I know.

30:26.305 --> 30:28.014
I know, baby, but listen to me.

30:28.015 --> 30:32.085
It's time that you start
to trust yourself, okay?

30:33.062 --> 30:34.938
Now you take the budget from TalkBACK

30:34.939 --> 30:36.481
and you go and you find some

30:36.482 --> 30:38.567
new fresh idea people, you know?

30:38.568 --> 30:40.235
People with no life, no kids.

30:40.236 --> 30:42.680
Somebody who can be with you 24/7.

30:44.323 --> 30:47.033
I hear you. Hear me out.

30:47.034 --> 30:51.913
Don't you think that producing this kind
of show will get you closer to your dreams?

30:51.914 --> 30:53.665
- I mean, don't forget about you here.
- (SIGHS)

30:53.666 --> 30:55.083
You've got hopes. You've got dreams.

30:55.084 --> 30:57.502
I know, but listen, I...

30:57.503 --> 31:00.255
My dreams are on hold for right now

31:00.256 --> 31:01.714
because, you know, I just...

31:01.715 --> 31:04.676
My thing is I want to come to
work, I want to make my money,

31:04.677 --> 31:08.388
and I wanna... I wanna do a good
job here and get back in time

31:08.389 --> 31:10.290
so that I can help raise my sons.

31:15.020 --> 31:16.380
Okay.

31:18.316 --> 31:19.925
What about Marisol?

31:22.027 --> 31:23.570
What about Marisol?

31:23.571 --> 31:25.905
She doesn't have any kids. I'm
sure she doesn't have a life.

31:25.906 --> 31:28.741
I could let her co-host every so often.

31:28.742 --> 31:31.244
- This'll be a great way to break her in.
- (SCOFFS)

31:31.245 --> 31:32.663
She's already broken in. Trust me.

31:32.664 --> 31:34.164
Do I detect a little shade?

31:34.165 --> 31:36.166
No, no, I'm just saying

31:36.167 --> 31:38.209
that she is not a host

31:38.210 --> 31:39.836
or a co-host, okay?

31:39.837 --> 31:42.422
She is not Mary Jane Paul.

31:42.423 --> 31:45.509
There's only one Mary Jane
Paul, baby, and that's it.

31:45.510 --> 31:48.913
Which is why I know I will succeed
in getting you to come back.

31:50.598 --> 31:53.084
(LAUGHING) Yeah.

31:54.226 --> 31:55.810
Bye, Felicia!

31:55.811 --> 31:58.104
<i>Hasta luego. Buenas noches.</i>

31:58.105 --> 31:59.564
- Come on back.
- I love you and I'm outta here.

31:59.565 --> 32:01.525
<i>- Come on back.
- Adios.</i>

32:01.526 --> 32:03.026
You know you're comin' back.

32:03.027 --> 32:04.386
Bye!

32:26.050 --> 32:27.884
So...

32:27.885 --> 32:29.828
I'm getting out of the half-way house.

32:31.681 --> 32:33.206
Well, that's great.

32:34.183 --> 32:35.542
I wanted to tell you first.

32:36.268 --> 32:37.878
Yeah.

32:39.731 --> 32:41.356
You said as soon as I was clean,

32:41.357 --> 32:42.982
we'd get back together again.

32:42.983 --> 32:44.984
I had fun putting her to bed.

32:44.985 --> 32:47.304
She was so happy with
that family dinner.

32:49.323 --> 32:51.142
(SIGHS) Tracy...

32:54.870 --> 32:57.121
We'll co-parent, but... (SIGHS)

32:57.122 --> 32:58.857
We're not getting back together.

33:01.586 --> 33:03.028
You just want to co-parent?

33:04.963 --> 33:06.381
TRACY: I got it.

33:06.382 --> 33:08.341
You got yourself together.
Now you don't wanna help me.

33:08.342 --> 33:10.927
It's not about that. I'll help
you get a job, give you money.

33:10.928 --> 33:12.746
I want you to do well. I just...

33:13.013 --> 33:14.456
Just not with you?

33:16.642 --> 33:18.669
After all I've done for you?

33:19.771 --> 33:21.854
I stuck by you when
you didn't have a job.

33:21.855 --> 33:23.732
I believed in you when everyone,

33:23.733 --> 33:26.568
including your uppity-ass
family doubted you

33:26.569 --> 33:28.804
and I loved you even when
you didn't love yourself.

33:29.363 --> 33:30.848
This is...

33:33.534 --> 33:35.326
This is how you treat me?

33:35.327 --> 33:36.561
You know what?

33:37.455 --> 33:39.064
You need to stop.

33:39.957 --> 33:41.650
I never promised you anything.

33:42.752 --> 33:43.918
You told me you loved me.

33:43.919 --> 33:44.961
Because I do.

33:44.962 --> 33:46.404
You had my child.

33:47.256 --> 33:48.590
Don't play me.

33:48.591 --> 33:50.283
You keep lying to yourself.

33:50.884 --> 33:53.511
We had sex and had a baby.

33:53.512 --> 33:57.098
You mistook a nice guy who cares
for you for happily-ever-after.

33:57.099 --> 33:58.891
This ain't new. I've
told you this before,

33:58.892 --> 34:00.226
but you don't wanna hear me.

34:00.227 --> 34:02.479
You want me to be
that guy that left you,

34:02.480 --> 34:06.341
when I'm just hoping that we can
just try and raise our daughter.

34:07.109 --> 34:08.610
Can we do that?

34:08.610 --> 34:12.155
Can we just try and do right by
her? Please, I'm just... (SIGHS)

34:12.156 --> 34:14.783
I'm not gon' leave you hanging. I'm...

34:14.784 --> 34:17.228

34:40.726 --> 34:43.186
Oh, are you beating me to work now?

34:43.187 --> 34:46.523
Well, somebody said I
could produce my own show.

34:46.524 --> 34:48.483
Well, okay, okay, girlfriend.

34:48.484 --> 34:50.150
- Excuse me.

Oh, my goodness, Well,

34:57.284 --> 34:58.409
- Okay.

34:59.704 --> 35:01.354
She says she's
your sister-in-law.

35:02.956 --> 35:04.399
Okay.

35:05.376 --> 35:07.360
Okay. Bye.

35:10.798 --> 35:12.423
MARY JANE: <i>Why are you here?</i>

35:12.424 --> 35:13.966
It's important.

35:13.967 --> 35:15.426
I need to talk to you about Patrick.

35:15.427 --> 35:16.661
What about him?

35:17.471 --> 35:19.331
Your brother is on drugs again.

35:21.392 --> 35:23.643
If you wasted your bus fare
to come all the way up here

35:23.644 --> 35:25.520
- to tell me that, you're stupid.
- So, you don't believe me.

35:25.521 --> 35:27.271
No, I don't believe you, Tracy.

35:27.272 --> 35:29.315
You know, I actually
see my brother and I...

35:29.316 --> 35:32.276
- I see that he's doing great.
- You don't think I can see the signs?

35:32.277 --> 35:34.320
We're both addicts. I
know all of his tricks.

35:34.321 --> 35:35.572
I even taught him some.

35:35.573 --> 35:38.199
I wouldn't brag about that.

35:38.200 --> 35:41.786
I am not proud of my past, but
I'm telling you he's using again.

35:41.787 --> 35:43.454
His eyes are all glossy.

35:43.455 --> 35:45.081
All of a sudden, he has
extra energy to burn,

35:45.082 --> 35:46.750
and his mood is
happy-go-lucky.

35:46.751 --> 35:48.084
When is Patrick ever that?

35:48.085 --> 35:50.112
Have you talked to Patrick about this?

35:50.922 --> 35:52.823
He won't open up to me, not anymore.

35:54.007 --> 35:56.843
I... I... I didn't want to come to you,

35:56.844 --> 35:59.788
but the truth is you're probably
the only person he'll talk to.

36:01.014 --> 36:03.416
It's a little peculiar, don't you think?

36:04.017 --> 36:06.060
I mean, why wouldn't he tell you?

36:06.061 --> 36:08.980
I mean, you... You guys have
been through so much together.

36:08.981 --> 36:10.607
I mean, you've seen him at his lowest.

36:10.608 --> 36:13.302
Hell, you taught him all
those valuable tricks.

36:15.905 --> 36:18.431
This isn't about me.
This is about Patrick.

36:18.866 --> 36:20.366
Don't you want to help him?

36:20.367 --> 36:21.826
Of course, I want to help him.

36:21.827 --> 36:23.620
Do you have proof that he's using again?

36:23.621 --> 36:26.080
Have you... Have you
actually seen him doing drugs?

36:26.081 --> 36:27.832
I don't need proof. I know the signs.

36:27.833 --> 36:29.500
And I know my brother!

36:29.501 --> 36:31.419
And the next time you
bring your ass up to my job

36:31.420 --> 36:34.130
making wild accusation, I
will have your ass arrested.

36:34.131 --> 36:35.448
Get out.

36:36.133 --> 36:38.369
- You are such a bitch.
- Thanks.

36:45.350 --> 36:47.226
PATRICK: <i>I can't believe
she came to your job.</i>

36:47.227 --> 36:48.686
<i>I'll talk to her.</i>

36:48.687 --> 36:51.982
No, you don't have to. I was just
trying to make sure you were okay.

36:51.983 --> 36:53.775
She was saying some pretty crazy stuff.

36:53.776 --> 36:55.735
- Like what?
- You're on drugs.

36:55.736 --> 36:58.571
(SCOFFS) She's just pissed
that I don't wanna be with her.

36:58.572 --> 37:00.490
That's a hell of a
way to get back at you.

37:00.491 --> 37:02.241
Yeah, that's just Tracy.

37:02.242 --> 37:04.494
Well, I kicked her ass out of my office.

37:04.495 --> 37:05.662
- What?
- Yeah.

37:05.663 --> 37:07.163
Oh, you cold, Letta.

37:07.164 --> 37:09.373
No, I was just trying to have your back

37:09.374 --> 37:11.484
and she just kept insisting
that she was right.

37:18.050 --> 37:19.717
You're not on drugs, are you, Patrick?

37:19.718 --> 37:20.760
No, I'm not on drugs.

37:20.761 --> 37:22.679
Okay.

37:22.680 --> 37:25.807
I mean, you know, I'm taking a little
something to help me focus, but...

37:25.808 --> 37:29.477
A little something,
like a prescription drug?

37:29.478 --> 37:31.855
Yeah, it's prescription,
but it's not my prescription.

37:31.856 --> 37:33.023
Oh, Jesus, Patrick.

37:33.024 --> 37:34.148
Now don't get all worked up.

37:34.149 --> 37:35.441
I mean, it's far from coke.

37:35.442 --> 37:37.652
I swear, I'll never do that again.

37:37.653 --> 37:39.763
You also swore you'd never do any drug.

37:40.698 --> 37:42.515
But you broke that promise.

37:47.120 --> 37:48.521

37:52.584 --> 37:54.335

37:56.463 --> 37:58.673
- I don't believe this.
- No, we don't believe it.

37:58.674 --> 38:00.158

38:03.762 --> 38:05.221
Why would you do this?

38:05.222 --> 38:07.291
It's not a street drug, Ma. It's not...

Are you going to stop?

38:30.831 --> 38:32.123
Sure.

38:32.124 --> 38:34.458
How can we believe anything you say?

38:34.459 --> 38:37.321
The lies spill out of your mouth
is just as easy as the truth.

38:37.755 --> 38:39.323
So I'm a liar now?

38:41.174 --> 38:43.134
