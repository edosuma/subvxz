00:06.620 --> 00:09.340
Thanks, Mom. This is
a perfect first job.

00:09.350 --> 00:10.690
First job?

00:10.700 --> 00:13.220
I think you're looking
at a birth of a career.

00:17.590 --> 00:21.590
I was going to have him put up fliers,
but I didn't trust him with a staple gun.

00:21.600 --> 00:22.940
How much are you paying him?

00:22.950 --> 00:26.080
Obviously, too much. Look at him.

00:29.130 --> 00:33.120
For the record, I promised
him $20 and a Playboy magazine.

00:33.130 --> 00:34.410
Playboy?

00:34.440 --> 00:35.680
Don't worry.

00:35.700 --> 00:38.760
I'll Magic-Marker over
the ta-tas and hoo-hoos.

00:39.420 --> 00:42.650
Oh, that's disturbing on so many levels.

You mean a different monkey.

********

01:07.430 --> 01:12.790
Well, it's not really a paycheck, and he's
not really earning it and we don't call him...

01:13.100 --> 01:15.680
I guess I got to give you Jughead.

01:15.690 --> 01:17.420
I remember my first job.

01:17.430 --> 01:18.510
Slaughterhouse.

01:18.520 --> 01:21.890
Strippin' out sheep intestines
for the condom companies.

01:25.950 --> 01:28.670
Not as sexy as it sounds.

01:28.680 --> 01:31.200
I was a fluffer in a pet salon.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.760
You know, with a blow dryer.

01:34.770 --> 01:37.480
I was going a completely different way.

01:40.260 --> 01:41.140
What are you doing?

01:41.160 --> 01:44.900
Thanks to Grandma, I'm reading
an interview with Jimmy Kimmel.

01:46.110 --> 01:48.000
Hey, Alan, you got any cash?

01:48.010 --> 01:49.110
Yeah. Why?

01:49.120 --> 01:50.450
I need to borrow some.

01:50.460 --> 01:51.590
What for?

01:51.610 --> 01:53.710
What are you, my mother?

01:53.720 --> 01:55.800
Just give me a few bucks,
save me a trip to the ATM.

01:55.820 --> 01:56.850
When will I get it back?

01:56.870 --> 01:58.820
I don't know. Tomorrow.

01:58.830 --> 02:01.140
Okay, how much do you need?

02:01.160 --> 02:03.360
Just a couple hundred.

02:04.120 --> 02:07.000
A couple hundred? Who carries
around that kind of money?

02:07.010 --> 02:08.270
Well, let's see...

02:08.280 --> 02:12.970
Strippers, bookies, prostitutes,
and not entirely coincidentally-- me.

02:14.210 --> 02:18.730
Well, I've only got... 35, 36...38

02:18.740 --> 02:22.670
That's it? That's your
walking around money?

02:22.680 --> 02:24.560
It's the perfect amount
in case I get mugged.

02:24.590 --> 02:27.820
See, not so little that my attacker will
get angry and try and pistol-whip me,

02:27.860 --> 02:32.630
yet not so much that I would feel obliged to fight for
it and possibly be shot while wrestling for the gun.

02:36.010 --> 02:38.530
- So you got $38.
- Yep.

02:39.220 --> 02:43.850
Just out of curiosity, how much money would
it take for you to wrestle a gun from a mugger?

02:43.870 --> 02:47.500
Assuming a small- to medium-
sized mugger, at least $40.

02:48.420 --> 02:50.230
Fine, so, give me the $38.

02:50.260 --> 02:51.720
- All of it?
- Why not?

02:51.730 --> 02:52.580
Then I've got nothing.

02:52.600 --> 02:55.300
And you think $38 changes that?

02:56.690 --> 02:58.850
What if I decide to go
out and have some fun?

02:58.880 --> 03:01.720
$38 worth of fun?

03:01.730 --> 03:04.170
I wouldn't spend all of it.

03:05.110 --> 03:07.440
Okay, okay, look, you're
not going out to have fun.

03:07.460 --> 03:09.370
You never go out to have
fun, because you know why?

03:09.390 --> 03:10.530
You're not a fun guy.

03:11.450 --> 03:13.230
Oh, I am very much a fun guy.

03:13.250 --> 03:15.280
We just have different
definitions of fun,

03:15.310 --> 03:19.130
and mine doesn't include urinary
tract infections and dry heaving.

03:20.530 --> 03:23.230
Just give me the money, ya big fruit.

03:23.750 --> 03:26.390
$38...

03:26.860 --> 03:29.910
If it had been $40, we'd
be wrestling, my friend!

03:35.210 --> 03:37.380
Hey, Charlie?

03:44.400 --> 03:46.460
You got my money?

03:49.440 --> 03:51.090
Charlie!

03:51.100 --> 03:52.760
I'm trying to sleep, Alan.

03:52.780 --> 03:55.110
Yeah, well, I've got to go to work
and you said you'd have my money.

03:55.140 --> 03:57.570
Oh, for God's sake.

03:57.590 --> 03:59.500
You don't even have to get
up. Just tell me where it is.

03:59.510 --> 04:01.710
Well, the last I saw any of it,

04:01.720 --> 04:06.990
it was sandwiched between two of the loveliest
man-made breasts that ever smacked me in the eye.

04:07.650 --> 04:11.430
Oh, Charlie, you say
the sweetest things.

04:11.760 --> 04:14.940
Oh, Ginger, this is my
brother Alan. Alan, Ginger.

04:17.360 --> 04:19.649
So bottom line, you don't have my money?

04:19.670 --> 04:20.360
No.

04:20.390 --> 04:22.370
The money you promised
to pay back today?

04:22.390 --> 04:24.140
The day hasn't even started yet.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.320
It started for me.

04:25.330 --> 04:29.130
That's only because you're
on Douchebag Savings Time.

04:29.140 --> 04:31.910
Can we please talk about this
when one of us doesn't have a warm,

04:31.930 --> 04:35.000
firm buttock nestled against his groin?

04:35.360 --> 04:37.080
Oh, dear Lord.

04:37.090 --> 04:38.520
So you'll get it by tonight?

04:38.540 --> 04:41.080
I'm hopin' to get it as
soon as you close the door.

04:45.110 --> 04:46.660
Are you really out of cash?

04:46.670 --> 04:49.450
Don't worry. I've got hooker money.

04:58.910 --> 05:00.800
* When you're hungry at school *

05:00.810 --> 05:02.570
* You need to know *

05:02.580 --> 05:06.010
* Paste yes, boogers no.*

05:12.160 --> 05:14.530
How was your day, darling?

05:14.540 --> 05:18.650
Fine, except I had to pay for lunch
with my lucky Sacagawea dollar.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.120
What kind of lunch can
you get for a dollar?

05:21.140 --> 05:25.630
Two gas station hot dogs that were a year
old if they were a day, thank you very much.

05:26.010 --> 05:30.100
Is Sacagawea the same Indian chick
that's on the Land O'Lakes butter?

05:30.750 --> 05:32.520
I don't know.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.660
I hope so.

05:35.620 --> 05:37.790
I'd like to believe it is.

05:38.330 --> 05:41.090
Okay, Charlie, I'm leaving.

05:41.100 --> 05:43.860
Hang on. Let me pay you.

05:47.600 --> 05:48.890
Here you go.

05:48.900 --> 05:50.930
Did you forget I paid for
that pizza the other night?

05:50.950 --> 05:53.580
Oh, right. How much was that?

05:53.590 --> 05:57.190
Well, you got the garlic
balls too, so, say...

05:57.210 --> 05:59.490
75 bucks.

06:00.170 --> 06:01.370
You got change for a hundred?

06:01.380 --> 06:02.450
Nope.

06:02.460 --> 06:04.160
Okay, you'll pay me back.

06:04.180 --> 06:06.500
Count on it.

06:09.230 --> 06:12.870
Wait, wait, wait, as long as you're
doling it out, you got my 40 bucks?

06:12.890 --> 06:13.920
Oh, sure.

06:13.930 --> 06:15.540
- You got change for a hundred?
- Nope.

06:15.550 --> 06:17.250
Okay, I'll catch you later.

06:17.860 --> 06:19.160
Wait...

06:19.170 --> 06:21.380
How come Berta can pay
you back and I can't?

06:21.390 --> 06:24.380
Oh, grow up. She's
not gonna pay me back.

06:24.770 --> 06:26.320
Okay, then, what about me?

06:26.330 --> 06:27.240
What about you?

06:27.260 --> 06:29.150
I want my $40.

06:29.160 --> 06:30.940
I only borrowed $38.

06:30.950 --> 06:33.840
Yeah, well, I find round
numbers easier to remember.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.420
Oh, you like round numbers, do you?

06:35.440 --> 06:37.370
Yes, I like round numbers.

06:37.380 --> 06:41.120
Okay, here's a round
number for you. Zero.

06:41.910 --> 06:44.130
Nice, tight circular shape.

06:44.140 --> 06:47.460
Nothing gets in, nothing gets
out. Sound familiar, Alan?

06:48.140 --> 06:49.830
Are you calling me anal?

06:49.840 --> 06:53.220
That's right.
A-L-A-N, anal.

06:54.260 --> 06:59.570
Okay, okay, okay. So, so bottom line, you're
not gonna pay me back. Is that correct?

06:59.580 --> 07:04.740
Well, truth be told, I was gonna pay
you back, but your attitude irks me.

07:04.750 --> 07:05.720
I irk you?

07:05.730 --> 07:08.930
That's right. I find you irksome.

07:09.710 --> 07:12.130
You're a big, fat irk.

07:12.790 --> 07:16.560
Hey, hey, you borrow
$38, you owe me $38.

07:16.570 --> 07:19.760
Yeah, well, you've been living in
my Malibu beach house for six years.

07:19.770 --> 07:22.350
You owe me $1 million.

07:23.120 --> 07:24.710
A million dollars?

07:24.740 --> 07:28.640
That's a one followed by
six tight little sphincters.

07:41.940 --> 07:43.280
You look tired.

07:43.290 --> 07:45.520
Yesterday, I had a quarter tank of gas.

07:45.530 --> 07:50.270
Today, I drive a mile into
Topanga Canyon and bang, empty.

07:51.300 --> 07:55.940
There's no cell coverage up there, so I had to hump
all the way back down to the beach to call Triple-A.

07:55.950 --> 07:56.590
Oh, that's a shame.

07:56.610 --> 08:00.240
Shame, my ass. How the hell did a
quarter tank of gas disappear overnight?

08:00.590 --> 08:02.750
It's a mystery.

08:06.420 --> 08:09.510
Wait a minute... I smell gasoline.

08:10.520 --> 08:12.040
Really?

08:12.050 --> 08:14.560
I... I don't smell anything.

08:25.360 --> 08:27.120
You have gas on your breath.

08:27.130 --> 08:28.440
You siphoned my tank.

08:29.260 --> 08:30.590
Oh, please.

08:30.620 --> 08:33.419
You think I stuck a rubber
hose down your gas tank,

08:33.450 --> 08:39.299
sucked on it until the gas ran out of your tank and
into mine thereby compensating me for the $38 you owe me?

08:41.720 --> 08:44.130
That's preposterous.

08:44.140 --> 08:47.200
Yeah... Yeah, you're right.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.850
What was I thinking?

08:57.900 --> 08:59.720
What are you doing?

08:59.750 --> 09:04.860
Do me a favor. Say...
preposterous again.

09:05.980 --> 09:09.550
You're crazy! Get that away from me!

09:10.200 --> 09:13.040
Oh, come on. Come on.

09:13.350 --> 09:17.040
Just for grins say, "Help
me. My head's on fire."

09:17.050 --> 09:21.530
All right, all right, all right, I sucked
the gas out of your car! Now turn it off!

09:24.410 --> 09:27.990
Okay, fine. Well played.
You got your money back.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.680
actually...

09:30.690 --> 09:37.220
at 473.9 cents a gallon, you had
only $13.22 worth in your tank,

09:37.230 --> 09:40.500
so you still owe me $24.

09:46.700 --> 09:48.830
- Get out.
- What?

09:48.840 --> 09:51.120
Get out of my house.

09:51.130 --> 09:52.600
You know what? I just might.

09:52.610 --> 09:54.850
No, no, no, "might"
implies you have a choice.

09:55.410 --> 09:58.540
Oh, so you're going to
throw me out over $24. 78?

09:58.550 --> 10:03.400
No, I'm throwing you out because you're
a cheap, gas-sucking, flammable irk!

10:03.990 --> 10:06.230
I am not cheap.

10:06.240 --> 10:08.650
Leaving.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.860
no one's fault, Jake.
These things just happen.

10:19.870 --> 10:22.480
I don't know. They seem
to happen to you a lot.

10:25.020 --> 10:27.150
Oh, hey, guys. What are you doing here?

10:27.160 --> 10:29.720
Dad pissed off Uncle Charlie again.

10:31.470 --> 10:34.330
Sorry to show up unannounced like this.

10:34.340 --> 10:35.850
No problem. It's always good to see you.

10:35.860 --> 10:38.950
He got kicked out again?

10:38.960 --> 10:40.800
Damn it, Alan. What'd you do now?

10:40.810 --> 10:42.340
I didn't do anything.

10:42.350 --> 10:45.010
But I'm not going to be
staying at Charlie's anymore,

10:45.030 --> 10:49.040
so I thought I should bring Jake's stuff
back here until I find a place of my own.

10:49.050 --> 10:50.580
Fine. Good luck.

10:50.590 --> 10:52.400
But it's nobody's fault.

10:52.410 --> 10:54.380
I just think it's
time for me to move on.

10:54.390 --> 10:56.270
Okay. Good night.

10:56.280 --> 11:00.380
But FYI: Charlie's a thief, a liar
and I suspect something of a firebug.

11:00.390 --> 11:03.570
Really? Hmm, he struck
me as a straight shooter.

11:03.580 --> 11:07.450
Little loosey-goosey with the liquor and
the ladies, but all in all, a good fella.

11:09.470 --> 11:12.880
In what universe is
Charlie Harper a good fella?

11:12.890 --> 11:17.890
Well, I certainly don't know him as well
as you do, so I'll just shut my piehole.

11:19.470 --> 11:23.030
Uh, anyway, here's the
rest of Jake's stuff.

11:23.040 --> 11:26.290
I'll get you my new address
as soon as I have one.

11:26.300 --> 11:27.520
You do that.

11:27.530 --> 11:30.120
- So, where are you gonna stay till then?
- Piehole, Herb.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.470
Oh, I don't know.

11:32.480 --> 11:36.570
Things are a little tight right now,
so a hotel isn't really an option.

11:36.580 --> 11:41.000
Maybe the Y for a couple of
days, you know, but we'll see.

11:41.030 --> 11:45.660
I could sleep in my
office or... in the car.

11:45.670 --> 11:47.220
Oh, well, you can't do that.

11:47.250 --> 11:49.420
Piehole, piehole, piehole!

11:49.430 --> 11:51.800
Come on, Judith, you can't
expect a man to sleep in his car.

11:51.810 --> 11:54.250
You're good people. Just
let me just get a few things.

11:55.970 --> 11:59.250
I'm sure it'll be fine. He's not the
kind of guy who'll overstay his welcome.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.930
He's been at his
brother's for six years.

12:01.940 --> 12:06.320
Uh, Herb, would you mind giving
me a hand with the NordicTrack?

12:06.330 --> 12:08.020
Oh, sure.

12:10.050 --> 12:12.520
Love you.

12:18.170 --> 12:18.950
Hey, Charlie.

12:18.970 --> 12:20.070
Oh, hey, Herb, what's up?

12:20.080 --> 12:22.440
I came to pick up some stuff for Alan.

12:22.490 --> 12:23.250
For Alan?

12:23.260 --> 12:26.600
Yeah, he's staying with Judith and
I till he gets back on his feet.

12:26.630 --> 12:28.340
Gee, Herb, I hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

12:28.350 --> 12:33.170
but I've been waiting six years for that
khaki-wearing weasel to get on his feet.

12:33.550 --> 12:34.770
Judith mentioned that...

12:34.790 --> 12:37.780
using a lot of the same
words, interestingly enough.

12:37.790 --> 12:41.320
Anyway, he wanted to avoid having a scene with
you, so he asked if I'd pick up some of his stuff.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.590
And you agreed?

12:42.610 --> 12:45.220
I had to get out of there, Charlie.

12:45.700 --> 12:47.460
Okay, okay, fine. What do you need?

12:47.470 --> 12:50.120
Quite a few things,
actually. He gave me a list.

12:50.130 --> 12:54.120
Well, let him stay in there long
enough, he'll give you a bleeding ulcer.

12:54.540 --> 12:57.140
Yeah, Judith said that, too.

12:57.150 --> 13:00.730
Anyway, uh, melatonin, a mouth guard.

13:00.740 --> 13:02.560
I guess he grinds his teeth at night.

13:02.580 --> 13:05.290
I myself have restless legs syndrome.

13:05.300 --> 13:08.250
But just the left leg.
Right leg sleeps like a baby.

13:08.260 --> 13:09.490
What else, Herb?

13:09.500 --> 13:12.720
Well, I also got apnea
and I tend to drool a lot.

13:14.710 --> 13:17.300
- The list, Herb.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

13:17.310 --> 13:22.890
Let's see, shower cap, loofa mitt and some
kind of little stool that elevates his feet

13:22.900 --> 13:24.900
while he's sitting on the toilet.

13:24.910 --> 13:25.640
What?

13:25.650 --> 13:27.970
Yeah, apparently when the
morning coffee doesn't do the job,

13:27.990 --> 13:32.030
having his feet up gives him that extra
leverage for a successful bowel movement.

13:33.070 --> 13:34.020
You're kidding?

13:34.050 --> 13:37.580
No. Look. For a successful BM.

13:38.140 --> 13:40.640
That would mean "bowel movement."

13:41.270 --> 13:42.770
Okay, fine.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.450
Guest bedroom's right down there.

13:45.520 --> 13:48.080
Hey, I just made a pitcher
of margaritas. You want one?

13:48.090 --> 13:50.380
Oh, gee, I'll have to pass.

13:50.390 --> 13:52.990
Judith's waiting for me to get
back, and she gets really steamed...

13:53.000 --> 13:53.720
- Salt or no salt?
- Salt.

13:53.730 --> 13:55.570
- Okay.
- You got it.

14:03.080 --> 14:05.840
This is so weird.

14:06.070 --> 14:09.100
It's just for a couple days,
Jake. Don't make a federal case.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.060
You know this is probably
gonna affect my schoolwork.

14:12.100 --> 14:14.950
How? It's not like your
grades could get any lower.

14:14.960 --> 14:17.470
That's good, Alan.
Undermine his self-esteem.

14:17.480 --> 14:20.250
You see what I have to
live with on weekends?

14:20.260 --> 14:23.020
Nobody's talking to you.

14:24.760 --> 14:26.630
Where's he gonna sleep?

14:26.640 --> 14:28.770
I'm not a "he." I'm your father.

14:28.780 --> 14:31.770
How'd you get to be my
father if you're not a "he"?

14:33.470 --> 14:36.080
Go make up the couch.

14:36.090 --> 14:37.390
What about the guest room?

14:37.400 --> 14:40.080
That's not a guest room
anymore. It's Herb's train room.

14:40.090 --> 14:40.990
His what?

14:41.010 --> 14:43.930
He's a model train aficionado.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.150
Aficionado?

14:46.160 --> 14:48.200
He works hard. He deserves a hobby.

14:48.210 --> 14:50.690
Sometimes he lets me wear the hat.

14:52.030 --> 14:55.030
I begged you for years to let
me turn that into a game room.

14:55.040 --> 14:57.330
Bumper pool, ping-pong, something.

14:57.340 --> 14:58.760
- Oh, this is different.
- How?

14:58.770 --> 15:01.270
Herb can play with his trains alone.

15:02.340 --> 15:05.540
I'm sure he does plenty
of stuff in there alone.

15:05.980 --> 15:07.760
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

15:08.870 --> 15:10.640
I got it.

15:17.780 --> 15:20.010
This is so beautiful.

15:20.550 --> 15:22.460
Yep.

15:22.470 --> 15:24.610
Can I confess something, Charlie?

15:24.620 --> 15:25.800
What's that?

15:25.810 --> 15:29.050
I sometimes wonder
about the road not taken.

15:29.060 --> 15:30.580
Which road is that?

15:30.590 --> 15:33.220
Your road, Charlie.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.490
It's a good road, Herb.

15:36.500 --> 15:39.260
So it's not a matter of the
grass always seems greener?

15:39.280 --> 15:42.660
No, no. No, the grass is
pretty frickin' green over here.

15:44.240 --> 15:46.390
Damn!

15:50.240 --> 15:51.600
It's me.

15:51.610 --> 15:53.490
I hope so.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.880
It's the road taken.

15:56.560 --> 15:57.650
You're not gonna answer it?

15:57.680 --> 16:00.750
Nah. Judith will just harsh my mellow.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.440
Yeah, she's a mellow-harsher.

16:03.460 --> 16:05.180
But I love her.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.660
That's nice.

16:06.670 --> 16:11.220
You know, in the boudoir,
we're very simpatico.

16:11.230 --> 16:12.810
Glad to hear it.

16:12.830 --> 16:17.490
On top of everything else, she actually
let me put my train set in her back room.

16:41.880 --> 16:44.760
Damn cran-apple juice.

16:46.810 --> 16:49.410
I should start wearing a diaper.

17:39.910 --> 17:42.560
It's about time you got home.

17:45.880 --> 17:48.830
Is that an apology I'm feeling?

18:04.200 --> 18:05.790
Where's my husband?

18:05.800 --> 18:07.200
Sleeping on the deck.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.880
What? Why?

18:08.890 --> 18:10.380
He's drunk.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.010
Herb's not a drinker.

18:12.030 --> 18:14.090
No argument there.

18:14.100 --> 18:15.590
All right, here's how it's gonna go:

18:15.600 --> 18:19.650
I am taking him home with me and
you're taking back your brother.

18:19.930 --> 18:22.350
How 'bout this?

18:22.700 --> 18:26.700
You and Alan patch things up
and I keep Stretch out there.

18:26.710 --> 18:28.920
I'm kinda fond of the big lug.

18:28.930 --> 18:31.220
Charlie, I'm in no mood.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.290
- Not what I heard.
- What?

18:36.620 --> 18:38.740
I don't have time for
this. Alan, get in here!

18:38.750 --> 18:39.420
No!

18:39.430 --> 18:41.980
Do not make me come get you!

18:44.820 --> 18:48.640
Now... apologize to your brother.

18:50.020 --> 18:52.010
Do it!

18:55.370 --> 18:57.550
I'm sorry I made such a
big deal out of everything.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.480
And?

19:00.010 --> 19:03.770
And you can keep the $24.78

19:03.780 --> 19:05.590
This was all about $24?

19:05.600 --> 19:06.920
Plus he tried to set me on fire!

19:06.930 --> 19:09.630
Afr you sucked my gas!

19:10.170 --> 19:13.280
Hey, baby, when did
you arrive on the scene?

19:13.600 --> 19:15.180
Just get in the car.

19:15.190 --> 19:17.640
Look, poop stool.

19:18.180 --> 19:20.490
I'm gonna need that.

19:23.100 --> 19:26.160
You can pop a blood vessel
if you push too hard.

19:26.170 --> 19:27.910
Words to live by.

19:27.920 --> 19:29.860
Herb, car!

19:29.870 --> 19:31.110
- Bye, Charlie.
- Bye, Herb.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.660
- Bye, all.
- Bye, Herb.

19:32.670 --> 19:34.270
This was fun. Let's do it again.

19:34.280 --> 19:36.220
Now!

19:40.700 --> 19:42.960
Kinda like old times, huh?

19:43.320 --> 19:46.460
Judith kicking me out
and you taking me in.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.120
You are taking me in, aren't you?

19:51.130 --> 19:54.270
Give me one good reason why I should.

19:54.280 --> 19:59.040
Uh, well... we're... we're family...

19:59.350 --> 20:00.630
brothers.

20:00.640 --> 20:04.220
We share blood and, and, and history.

20:04.250 --> 20:07.440
We have a bond that unites us forever.

20:08.210 --> 20:10.340
Nah. What else you got?

20:11.260 --> 20:15.400
Okay. what about my French
toast? You like that.

20:15.410 --> 20:20.570
You know, thick and fluffy with
cinnamon and powdered sugar.

20:24.570 --> 20:26.530
- All right, you can stay.
- Really?

20:26.540 --> 20:27.910
No.

20:33.320 --> 20:35.530
Very funny.

20:36.030 --> 20:37.960
Charlie?

20:42.580 --> 20:45.570
You changed the locks?

20:46.010 --> 20:49.210
I was only gone for six hours!

20:49.220 --> 20:51.460
Charlie?

20:56.400 --> 20:58.230
Oh, crap.

21:02.910 --> 21:07.160
Here you go. Black, two
sugars. Double glazed.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.770
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

21:11.030 --> 21:13.000
I can't believe Grandma fired me.

21:13.010 --> 21:16.180
Well, the labor market's
very competitive these days.

21:16.190 --> 21:19.660
There's always somebody brighter and
better and willing to work for less.
