00:59.954 --> 01:01.663
Kimmy, what is all this stuff?

01:01.747 --> 01:04.081
The greatest shopping experience
of my life.

01:04.291 --> 01:06.668
It's called the 89 Cents store
and guess what?

01:07.252 --> 01:09.087
Everything's 89 cents?

01:10.505 --> 01:14.551
It's awesome. I'm never going back
to that snooty 99 Cents store.

01:17.888 --> 01:22.267
- I got it! That's the dance team.
- I bought some cookies for you guys.

01:23.978 --> 01:26.229
Mom, you couldn't get the real thing?

01:26.438 --> 01:30.191
Once they're on the platter, your friends
will never know the difference.

01:30.275 --> 01:32.694
You just can't eat them
near an open flame.

01:36.156 --> 01:38.826
- Hey, guys!
- Hi, Mom. Going to study. Bye, Mom.

01:38.909 --> 01:41.954
Hold on. It's 90 degrees out
and you have a jacket on.

01:42.162 --> 01:44.748
And that's not even your jacket.
What's going on?

01:44.957 --> 01:47.083
You're always so suspicious!

01:47.292 --> 01:53.423
Can't I just be wearing my friend's jacket
'cause it's National Jacket Swapping Day?

01:53.632 --> 01:56.092
What are you up to?

01:56.176 --> 01:59.972
Jackson, you're all banged up.

02:00.180 --> 02:02.850
- What happened?
- Oh, nothing.

02:02.933 --> 02:04.225
Max, what happened?

02:04.434 --> 02:08.521
He skateboarded off Bobby Popko's
tool shed and wiped out.

02:08.729 --> 02:11.274
- Max!
- Sorry.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.695
Here's your "don't tell Mom"
Jolly Ranchers back.

02:17.031 --> 02:19.074
Okay, have a seat.

02:19.157 --> 02:20.701
You know what, you guys?

02:20.784 --> 02:25.330
Every time you're at that Bobby Popko's
house, something bad happens.

02:25.413 --> 02:28.792
- Aren't his parents around?
- Oh, yes, yes, yes, of course.

02:28.876 --> 02:31.003
They're very responsible people.

02:31.086 --> 02:33.129
- Max?
- They're never home.

02:35.423 --> 02:37.009
Here's your Skittles.

02:39.970 --> 02:43.473
Until I talk to his parents,
you are not allowed at the Popkos'.

02:43.682 --> 02:45.308
What? That's bogus!

02:45.517 --> 02:48.020
Yeah, that's bogus!
Can I have the Skittles back?

02:50.105 --> 02:53.358
Boys, who's your favorite aunt?
No need to answer. I know it's me.

02:54.317 --> 02:58.154
Okay, I am deejaying at Lucha Kaboom
and I got us all tickets.

02:58.363 --> 03:00.532
- Wow! That's amazing!
- Oh, my gosh!

03:00.615 --> 03:03.035
I get to go to Lucha Kaboom?

03:03.744 --> 03:05.579
What's Lucha Kaboom?

03:06.329 --> 03:11.877
It's Mexican wrestling. It's got crazy
outfits, crazy stunts and crazy chickens.

03:12.086 --> 03:14.963
And guess who's headlining?
King Jaguarito.

03:15.047 --> 03:18.258
- Oh, my gosh!
- That is so cool!

03:18.466 --> 03:20.719
Who's King Dorito?

03:22.220 --> 03:24.556
Mom, he's not a corn chip.

03:26.892 --> 03:30.145
He's king of the jaguars
and he's my favorite wrestler!

03:30.353 --> 03:32.064
Oh. Well, as a veterinarian,

03:32.147 --> 03:36.568
I am always in favor of raising awareness
for endangered jungle cats.

03:38.278 --> 03:41.531
Yeah, 'cause that's what wrestling
is all about.

03:47.996 --> 03:50.206
- Great!
- Good job!

03:50.290 --> 03:54.628
Snack break!
I have some classic authentic Oreos.

03:56.546 --> 03:58.423
Oh. Hang on.

04:01.426 --> 04:03.887
That's a precaution
I would take with any cookie.

04:04.096 --> 04:05.430
Enjoy.

04:08.224 --> 04:10.894
Don't do it!
There ain't no cookie in those cookies.

04:12.854 --> 04:17.608
Great news! Your uniforms came in!
Check out the logo on the front!

04:17.692 --> 04:22.363
- That looks awesome!
- And the team sponsor on the back.

04:26.034 --> 04:28.536
I know.
They made it smaller than I wanted.

04:30.330 --> 04:35.376
Guys, we need a big finish. We've gotta
find something no one's ever seen before.

04:36.086 --> 04:37.545
This is your lucky day.

04:37.754 --> 04:41.257
I'm gonna share with you
my guaranteed big-finish showstopper.

04:41.466 --> 04:44.970
- Mom, that's really not necessary.
- Yes, it is.

04:46.596 --> 04:49.766
I present to you the Gibbler gallop.

04:49.850 --> 04:53.687
Five, six, seven, eight and sparkle.
Sparkle!

04:53.770 --> 04:55.939
And gallop and gallop.

04:57.273 --> 04:58.817
Now spank.

05:10.453 --> 05:13.081
I understand,
it looks impossible to master.

05:14.208 --> 05:18.628
However, two or three hours of practice,
and you'll be doing this in your sleep.

05:18.837 --> 05:20.839
That's where nightmares belong.

05:22.632 --> 05:25.135
Come on, girls. Giddyup. Ready?

05:25.219 --> 05:29.097
Five, six, seven, eight and sparkle.
Yes, sparkle.

05:29.181 --> 05:31.892
And giddyup! Come on! Yeah! That's it!

05:31.975 --> 05:34.728
More energy, Ramona! Come on! Whoo!

05:37.231 --> 05:39.274
D.J., you have got to see this.

05:39.941 --> 05:42.610
This kid put his history report
on a flash drive

05:42.694 --> 05:45.405
and his wiener dog swallowed it.

05:47.448 --> 05:50.994
So it finally happened.
A dog actually ate a kid's homework.

05:53.454 --> 05:54.748
What are you doing?

05:55.415 --> 05:58.001
I'm installing an app
to keep track of Jackson.

05:58.210 --> 06:02.130
- You're stalking your kid?
- No, don't be ridiculous.

06:02.214 --> 06:05.842
I'm just watching what he does
all the time without his knowledge.

06:07.177 --> 06:09.304
So you're stalking your kid?

06:09.512 --> 06:12.974
Look, Jackson's
in this crazy <i>Jackass</i> phase.

06:13.058 --> 06:14.976
He and his bad-news buddy Bobby Popko,

06:15.060 --> 06:17.979
like that name doesn't have trouble
written all over it,

06:18.188 --> 06:20.523
they're always doing stupid stuff.

06:20.732 --> 06:24.319
Here, look at Jackson
on Popko's YouTube channel.

06:24.527 --> 06:25.862
<i>Do it, dude.</i>

06:29.324 --> 06:32.535
<i>Yeah, man! Whoo-hoo! Yeah!</i>

06:32.744 --> 06:34.288
That's awesome.

06:35.997 --> 06:38.458
No, dumb and dangerous!

06:38.666 --> 06:41.920
Come on, D.J. You have three boys.
You better get used to it.

06:42.003 --> 06:45.506
I mean, this is what guys do.
We're idiots.

06:45.715 --> 06:48.593
You don't have kids.
You don't know what it's like to be a mom.

06:48.802 --> 06:51.638
And you don't know
what it's like to be a boy, so there.

06:55.350 --> 06:56.517
Oh!

06:56.601 --> 07:01.898
Look! Jackson just showed up at Popko's
house and he knows he's not allowed.

07:01.982 --> 07:03.191
I'm going down there.

07:03.399 --> 07:06.694
Now you're gonna embarrass the poor kid
in front of his friends?

07:06.903 --> 07:09.823
No, I'm gonna show up unannounced,
drag him out by his ear

07:09.906 --> 07:12.284
and make him walk home
while I drive behind him.

07:16.746 --> 07:18.414
You're looking good, Max.

07:18.623 --> 07:20.625
We'd better run our safety tests.

07:29.259 --> 07:31.427
- Did it hurt?
- Not a bit.

07:32.762 --> 07:34.222
Safety test is a go!

07:34.430 --> 07:36.391
Lay down on this target, kid.

07:42.063 --> 07:46.818
- Do it, dude!
- Prepare to be <i>El Explosivo-ed!</i>

07:51.614 --> 07:54.659
Oh, my Gosh!

07:54.742 --> 07:57.537
- Jackson!
- Hi, Mom!

07:57.745 --> 07:59.873
- That better not be your brother.
- Hi, Mom.

08:02.876 --> 08:04.961
Max, are you okay?

08:05.170 --> 08:07.255
I'm fantastic!

08:08.548 --> 08:11.301
You boys know
you're not supposed to be here.

08:11.509 --> 08:13.428
Jackson said you gave us permission.

08:17.765 --> 08:18.933
And now you lied?

08:19.142 --> 08:21.811
In my defense,
how did you even know I was here?

08:22.396 --> 08:27.025
Dude, your mom's a vet.
She must have dog-chipped you.

08:28.484 --> 08:32.197
I did not dog-chip him.
I used mother's intuition.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.615
Which is the name of the app I used
to track you.

08:35.950 --> 08:38.160
You can forget about going
to Lucha Kaboom.

08:38.370 --> 08:40.705
- What?
- And where are your parents?

08:40.914 --> 08:45.085
My mom just stepped out.
She'll be back the minute you leave.

08:46.461 --> 08:48.380
I'm on to you, Popko.

08:49.339 --> 08:51.132
Let's go, boys.

08:59.391 --> 09:01.142
Mom!

09:01.226 --> 09:03.186
Mom, a little help, please!

09:08.566 --> 09:10.151
- Great!
- That was so good!

09:11.652 --> 09:14.155
Thank you for sparing us
from the Gibbler gallop.

09:14.364 --> 09:17.075
Rihanna and I worked these moves out
in a club in Lisbon,

09:17.284 --> 09:20.036
whereas the Gibbler gallop
was developed in a barn.

09:21.955 --> 09:25.917
Excuse me. Why are you sneaking
a rehearsal in your bedroom?

09:26.126 --> 09:31.047
Um, Stephanie was just helping us
make the moves a little... cooler.

09:31.256 --> 09:35.427
Cooler, huh? Hey... You want cool moves?

09:35.510 --> 09:38.554
Put your parkas on
'cause here comes the Running Man.

09:40.848 --> 09:42.392
And the Carlton.

09:45.061 --> 09:47.021
Stop! Hammer time!

09:52.152 --> 09:53.903
Kimmy... Kim...

09:54.112 --> 09:56.739
Let's face it, okay?
You're stuck in the '90s.

09:56.948 --> 09:59.242
The '90s? As if!

10:01.869 --> 10:05.165
My moves are all that and a bag of chips,
so talk to the hand, loser!

10:05.248 --> 10:08.376
Oh, snap! You go, girl!
I think I just did!

10:10.378 --> 10:13.840
Well, we have some great news
here in the present.

10:13.923 --> 10:16.926
I talked to the promoter
and how would you girls like to do

10:17.010 --> 10:19.929
a little in-between match performance
at Lucha Kaboom?

10:20.138 --> 10:22.390
- That would be great!
- Awesome!

10:22.598 --> 10:23.724
Hey!

10:23.933 --> 10:28.522
I didn't see the Gibbler gallop
in that routine, so I have to say, "Whoa!"

10:30.648 --> 10:33.943
Mom, you are so good at...

10:34.861 --> 10:37.655
driving us around and getting us snacks

10:37.738 --> 10:40.325
that we've decided
to make you president of that.

10:40.408 --> 10:41.909
Congratulations!

10:42.994 --> 10:46.247
And we're making Stephanie
Vice President of Hot Dance Moves.

10:46.747 --> 10:47.999
Oh!

10:48.082 --> 10:50.585
I humbly accept the position.

10:51.294 --> 10:53.921
If that's how you all feel,
I'll just step aside.

10:54.130 --> 10:56.550
But for the record,
I am not stuck in the '90s.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.926
This is all '80s, baby.

11:05.933 --> 11:09.521
Look at you, doing the Gibbler gallop!

11:09.729 --> 11:12.440
Yeah! And sparkle, and sparkle!

11:12.524 --> 11:17.111
And gallop, and gallop and smack, smack.

11:17.195 --> 11:18.779
There you are!

11:18.988 --> 11:23.910
Hi! Grandma and Grandpa Fuller
are so excited to babysit you.

11:24.118 --> 11:28.789
Here you go, Mom. Coffee with a hint
of almond milk, just the way you like it.

11:29.457 --> 11:33.378
Jackson, thank you for the coffee
and for doing the dishes.

11:33.587 --> 11:35.505
And for breakfast in bed.

11:36.047 --> 11:38.091
But you're still not going.

11:38.299 --> 11:41.052
Well, that's perfect!
You know, I don't even wanna go.

11:41.135 --> 11:44.138
It sounds boring.
How's that for reverse psychology?

11:45.723 --> 11:50.061
A little tip: when you're using reverse
psychology, don't say you're using it.

11:51.729 --> 11:54.190
How am I to know?
I'm not a reverse psychologist!

11:55.816 --> 11:58.403
Coach, we're all so excited
to go to Lucha Kaboom.

11:58.612 --> 12:01.573
- We never could have done it without you.
- You're welcome.

12:01.781 --> 12:05.201
Aw... Yes, Stephanie, you're so wonderful.

12:06.578 --> 12:09.872
- Are you still mad about the dance thing?
- Don't be silly!

12:10.081 --> 12:11.165
Check this out!

12:12.166 --> 12:16.712
Aunt Stephanie got me
an official King Jaguarito costume!

12:17.338 --> 12:18.548
You're the best!

12:20.883 --> 12:25.221
"Look at me! I'm Aunt Stephanie!
I can do everything!

12:25.430 --> 12:27.432
Everyone loves me.

12:27.641 --> 12:30.143
I have big boobs."

12:35.607 --> 12:39.569
Okay, not that this
isn't a wonderful topic, but...

12:39.777 --> 12:42.155
Max, you look so jungly.

12:42.363 --> 12:46.075
Well, Jackson and I added the skull
and some fake blood to the king's bone.

12:46.159 --> 12:50.079
Some of the blood's real. I cut myself
opening the fake-blood packaging.

12:50.288 --> 12:52.081
Oh. Boo-hoo.

12:55.084 --> 12:56.294
Let's go.

12:56.877 --> 13:01.174
I got the keys and the snacks because
apparently that's all I'm good for.

13:01.382 --> 13:04.552
Goodbye, everybody.
I hope you don't have a good time.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.347
Don't worry, when I get home

13:07.430 --> 13:12.768
I'll tell you about every unbelievable,
unforgettable, super-cool moment!

13:15.229 --> 13:17.106
That didn't cheer you up, did it?

13:18.065 --> 13:21.068
Come on, Max. Sorry, Jackson.

13:34.499 --> 13:38.878
<i>Buenos días</i> and welcome to Lucha Kaboom!

13:42.298 --> 13:47.011
The only Mexican wrestling league
that is too dangerous for Mexico itself.

13:48.388 --> 13:52.808
Now, please welcome Los Pollos Locos!

14:02.109 --> 14:06.280
Holy chalupas!
This is the greatest day of my life!

14:09.825 --> 14:12.078
Okay, team, you guys go on in two minutes.

14:12.870 --> 14:15.248
- Where's Sara?
- She just texted.

14:15.331 --> 14:18.125
Sara ate some bad <i>pollo</i>
and her butt went <i>loco.</i>

14:20.253 --> 14:21.962
But our dance needs four people.

14:23.256 --> 14:26.217
Stephanie, you know all the moves.
Will you please do it?

14:29.721 --> 14:34.308
Look, as your coach, I have to advise you
to get the best dancer available

14:34.392 --> 14:36.519
and she's sitting right next to you.

14:40.607 --> 14:42.900
Well, well, well.

14:42.983 --> 14:45.403
Look who comes crawling back
to Kimmy Gibbler.

14:48.114 --> 14:49.449
I'm in!

14:52.410 --> 14:56.205
I know what you're thinking.
I swear I did not poison Sara.

14:57.415 --> 14:59.333
Okay. Come on. Let's go.

15:00.501 --> 15:03.504
It's time for the King Jaguarito
costume contest.

15:03.713 --> 15:08.259
The winner will be selected
by King Jaguarito himself!

15:08.342 --> 15:09.761
And here he comes!

15:12.555 --> 15:15.057
The greatest <i>luchador</i> in <i>luchador</i> history.

15:22.982 --> 15:26.444
We have a winner,
King Jaguarito-ito!

15:26.653 --> 15:28.488
Congratulations, Mini-Me.

15:29.447 --> 15:33.451
You're my hero. You're little
like me, but you're a champion.

15:33.660 --> 15:35.328
Don't judge me by my size.

15:35.411 --> 15:39.332
Judge me by the size of the heart I rip
from my opponent's chest.

15:40.916 --> 15:42.918
That's beautiful.

15:43.878 --> 15:47.548
I would be honored to have you pound
someone senseless with my club.

15:47.757 --> 15:51.344
I'll take it!
I love how you pimped out my club.

15:51.552 --> 15:53.387
I gotta get a picture!

15:57.975 --> 16:01.020
- Okay, let's go to our seat.
- Lady, wrong little person.

16:04.357 --> 16:07.109
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome our special guests,

16:07.318 --> 16:09.445
the Van Atta Middle School dance team!

16:13.867 --> 16:18.078
Sponsored by Gibbler Style Party Planning!
$5 off your next <i>quinceañera.</i>

16:56.325 --> 16:57.535
You guys wanna see more?

16:59.453 --> 17:00.955
But we don't have any more.

17:01.163 --> 17:03.040
Oh, yes, we do. Right, Mom?

17:04.709 --> 17:06.794
Give me a back beat
and put some stank on it!

17:16.762 --> 17:18.222
Now spank!

17:20.767 --> 17:23.269
Okay, let's review the Popko plan.

17:23.477 --> 17:25.896
Put on the mask
and sneak into the wrestling match.

17:26.105 --> 17:28.983
And I leave my phone here
because my mom tracks me.

17:29.066 --> 17:31.444
As if I can't be trusted!

17:32.820 --> 17:34.363
Here's the genius part.

17:34.572 --> 17:36.616
I strapped the phone to the dog's collar,

17:36.699 --> 17:38.993
so your mom
will think you're moving around.

17:40.536 --> 17:42.538
Why don't you hold it and move around?

17:43.122 --> 17:45.625
Do you wanna tell him
he's not part of the plan?

17:47.293 --> 17:48.836
Okay, the dog's in.

17:49.044 --> 17:50.463
Now go!

17:52.423 --> 17:54.717
And now to take on Los Pollos Locos,

17:54.926 --> 17:59.639
give it up for your heroes, Los Calaveras!

18:09.607 --> 18:11.943
These chickens are <i>mucho</i> sneaky!

18:12.151 --> 18:14.361
Boo! No!

18:14.445 --> 18:18.115
Wait, I'm confused.
I thought we liked the crazy chickens.

18:18.198 --> 18:21.786
No, not anymore.
Now we love Los Calaveras.

18:21.869 --> 18:23.704
But they're skeletons!

18:24.998 --> 18:29.460
They're good skeletons,
guitar-playing skeletons in shiny suits.

18:29.543 --> 18:31.004
Why is this so hard for you?

18:33.047 --> 18:35.967
All I know is Jackson
would have loved this.

18:38.928 --> 18:42.890
Oh! Did you see what that chicken did?
Boo, chicken!

18:45.351 --> 18:47.687
Deej, I think
Jackson's learned his lesson.

18:47.770 --> 18:50.230
Cut him some slack and get him down here.

18:50.314 --> 18:52.525
You're right. I'm gonna call him.

19:00.908 --> 19:02.159
Do not answer that.

19:08.207 --> 19:10.334
These chickens are bad eggs!

19:10.417 --> 19:12.753
I mean, that is very foul play!

19:12.962 --> 19:14.881
Look. Help is on the way!

19:14.964 --> 19:18.801
Your hero King Jaguarito
is here to save the day.

19:18.885 --> 19:24.098
Oh! The king <i>El Explosivo</i> hit 'em
right in the chicken tenders.

19:24.473 --> 19:25.892
But what is this?

19:29.603 --> 19:31.271
Oh, the king is in trouble.

19:32.147 --> 19:34.608
He's taking a vicious chicken-lickin'.

19:34.817 --> 19:36.694
He's being pounded and deboned.

19:36.903 --> 19:40.239
That's Max's club.
Max, what are you doing in there?

19:42.616 --> 19:45.452
Oh. Who is this young Jaguarito wannabe?

19:48.039 --> 19:51.042
He seems to have
no wrestling skills whatsoever!

19:56.630 --> 20:00.676
Oh, boy! They are about
to perform the ultimate humiliation!

20:00.885 --> 20:02.929
The unmasking!

20:04.138 --> 20:06.348
- Jackson?
- Max?

20:06.557 --> 20:09.184
Jackson's not picking up.
Something's wrong.

20:09.268 --> 20:12.396
Yeah, he's getting his butt kicked
by some crazy chickens.

20:14.107 --> 20:16.692
Hang on, Jackson! Momma's comin'!

20:19.779 --> 20:23.116
Take your hands off my son,
you damn dirty chickens!

20:24.951 --> 20:27.828
An unknown wrestler
has just entered the ring!

20:28.037 --> 20:31.665
Who is this brave <i>señorita</i>
with a death wish?

20:34.043 --> 20:37.463
There is a foxy lady in the hen house.

20:38.923 --> 20:40.549
Nice! Go, Mom!

20:43.552 --> 20:44.720
Get 'em, Mom!

20:44.929 --> 20:47.222
Right in the Chicken McNuggets.

20:49.433 --> 20:51.685
<i>Dios mío,</i> look at her go.

20:51.894 --> 20:54.647
She's whipping up
a chopped chicken salad out there.

20:57.066 --> 20:59.944
This has never been attempted!

21:00.027 --> 21:03.363
They're going for a double <i>El Explosivo!</i>

21:06.533 --> 21:08.410
Oh! They did it!

21:08.494 --> 21:13.373
Ladies and gentlemen, you've just
witnessed Lucha Kaboom history.

21:20.339 --> 21:24.135
It's a double pin for the win.

21:29.223 --> 21:32.434
Our winners are King Jaguarito and...

21:32.643 --> 21:34.937
What do you call yourself,
brave <i>señorita</i> ?

21:35.146 --> 21:37.148
Just a mom who loves her son.

21:38.232 --> 21:41.401
<i>Mamacita del Amor!</i>

21:48.993 --> 21:52.079
Come on in. We need to talk.
Then I need a hot bath.

21:52.997 --> 21:54.999
Mom, you went nuts in there.

21:55.208 --> 21:56.876
How do you know all of those moves?

21:57.084 --> 21:58.169
I don't know.

21:58.252 --> 22:02.006
Once I saw you were in trouble,
my momma bear instincts just kicked in.

22:02.715 --> 22:05.176
After that, it was a blur,
just a bunch of feathers

22:05.259 --> 22:08.971
and then someone offered me a one-year
contract to be <i>Mamacita del Amor.</i>

22:09.805 --> 22:11.515
Ah! You should totally do it.

22:11.724 --> 22:14.894
Mexican wrestling
doesn't pay as much as you'd think.

22:16.937 --> 22:21.525
- Let's talk about you.
- I know. I shouldn't have snuck out.

22:21.608 --> 22:23.152
I'm very sorry.

22:23.360 --> 22:25.487
- Okay, good talk. Let's hug it out.
- Uh...

22:26.321 --> 22:28.699
Nice try. There are gonna be consequences.

22:28.908 --> 22:30.868
I just don't understand.

22:31.077 --> 22:32.536
You've been lying.

22:32.619 --> 22:36.749
You've been getting hurt sneaking out,
doing these crazy stunts.

22:36.832 --> 22:41.087
- What's been going on with you lately?
- I'm just trying to have fun.

22:41.170 --> 22:43.422
Why do you have to be
so tough on me all the time?

22:45.716 --> 22:48.427
Maybe it's because
you're so much like your dad.

22:49.344 --> 22:51.180
What's wrong with that?

22:51.264 --> 22:54.683
Dad was awesome
and he did risky stuff every day.

22:54.892 --> 22:59.021
Well, he was a fireman
and that was part of his job.

22:59.105 --> 23:00.940
But you're just being reckless.

23:02.108 --> 23:05.819
And I just love you so much. I never want
anything bad to happen to you.

23:07.613 --> 23:10.741
I get it.
I'll try to be a little more careful.

23:11.366 --> 23:13.244
A lot more careful.

23:14.494 --> 23:18.249
And I'll try to be
a little less overprotective.

23:18.457 --> 23:20.876
A lot less overprotective.

23:22.044 --> 23:25.256
We'll start with a little.
Bring in the hug.

23:26.673 --> 23:30.052
Oh! Careful!
I caught a chicken wing to the neck.

23:32.096 --> 23:33.639
Oh, hey. And do me a favor.

23:33.847 --> 23:37.434
Stay away from that Popko kid.
There's something not right with him.

23:38.185 --> 23:42.148
Mom, he's my best friend.
He's my Kimmy Gibbler.

23:46.735 --> 23:49.780
That drought thing is such a scam.

23:49.863 --> 23:51.991
I just took a 90-minute shower.
