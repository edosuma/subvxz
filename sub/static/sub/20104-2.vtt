00:01.502 --> 00:04.872
Previously on Prison Break...
SARA:
Losing a brother--

00:04.905 --> 00:06.840
the massive hole
that leaves in your life.

00:06.874 --> 00:08.076
LINCOLN:
Like the same massive hole

00:08.109 --> 00:09.810
losing a husband makes.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.146
Your brother's dead, Lincoln.
How do you explain that?

00:12.180 --> 00:13.647
Lincoln Burrows.
Jacob.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.583
Uncle Lincoln!
Hey!

00:15.616 --> 00:17.251
SARA: 911. I have
an armed intruder in my house.

00:17.285 --> 00:19.353
(groans)
LINCOLN:
We've awoken something--

00:19.387 --> 00:21.422
something people are trying
to hide about Michael.

00:21.455 --> 00:24.192
I don't know who we're fighting.
Let's go to Yemen and find out.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.426
SARA: You don't know
a damn thing about Yemen.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.728
LINCOLN:
I'll find someone who does.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.663
C-NOTE: The country's falling
apart. Everyone wants out.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.265
(explosion)

00:31.299 --> 00:32.766
Welcome to the civil war.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.269
Come quickly, or
we'll all be dead!

00:35.303 --> 00:37.004
LINCOLN:
Who's that contact again?
C-NOTE: A woman named Sheba.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.372
LINCOLN: Michael's caught
in the middle of something big.

00:38.406 --> 00:40.174
C-NOTE:
Kaniel Outis is

00:40.208 --> 00:41.375
a big-time terrorist.
SHEBA:
We've arranged

00:41.409 --> 00:42.743
a visit to Ogygia Prison.

00:42.776 --> 00:44.112
LINCOLN:
That mean Michael's in there?

00:44.145 --> 00:46.013
Michael?

00:46.046 --> 00:48.249
My name isn't Michael,
and I don't know who you are.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.184
(speaking Arabic)

00:50.218 --> 00:52.353
Michael, what are you doing,
damn it?!

00:52.386 --> 00:55.022
REPORTER: The fighting in Yemen
intensified today

00:55.055 --> 00:57.891
as ISIL forces
get ever nearer to the capitol.

00:57.925 --> 01:00.528
The rebels, who have the stated
intent of taking over

01:00.561 --> 01:02.930
the country and establishing
a radical caliphate,

01:02.963 --> 01:04.864
are also bent on freeing
their leader,

01:04.897 --> 01:08.402
Abu Ramal, who was captured by
the government five years ago.

01:08.436 --> 01:11.639
Ramal is known for his extreme
views and practices,

01:11.672 --> 01:13.907
from using young girls
as sex slaves,

01:13.941 --> 01:16.877
to a medieval brand of justice
that includes public beheadings

01:16.910 --> 01:18.579
and executions in the street.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.548
Ramal is currently
being held in Yemen's

01:20.581 --> 01:23.784
most notorious penitentiary,
Ogygia Prison.

01:51.445 --> 01:52.713
Psst.

01:55.549 --> 01:57.385
(whispers):
This is it.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.423
Whip, get up here.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.692
MAN:
Is it happening?

02:04.725 --> 02:07.795
You are not going
to leave us, are you?

02:07.828 --> 02:10.663
If the rebels take
the city, we're dead.
MICHAEL: You've told us that

02:10.698 --> 02:13.401
a thousand times, Sid. You're
a broken record. Is it clear?

02:15.002 --> 02:16.704
SID:
Okay, it's clear.

02:16.737 --> 02:19.340
Whip. Come on.

02:20.708 --> 02:23.644
Lights go out...
(grunts) ...you follow.

02:23.677 --> 02:24.912
Come on.

02:30.184 --> 02:31.985
WHIP: Would have made it
so much easier

02:32.019 --> 02:35.323
if it was just you and me like
it was on all the other ones.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.325
Nothing is easy
on this one.

02:37.358 --> 02:40.093
Yeah, tell
me about it.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.769
One minute.

03:02.115 --> 03:04.518
(distant explosions rumbling)

03:20.268 --> 03:22.703
(sighs)

03:25.439 --> 03:27.040
Board spans the gap.

03:27.074 --> 03:29.243
Okay.

03:31.279 --> 03:32.580
Blanket covers the wire.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.748
(gasps)

03:34.782 --> 03:37.451
Now it's about
those lights going out.

03:39.487 --> 03:41.455
He didn't flash it
24 hours before.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.624
That's supposed
to be the signal.
Have faith.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.459
Seven straight nights?

03:45.493 --> 03:47.595
No signal, no lights
getting turned out?

03:51.499 --> 03:53.967
Those strikes are
getting closer, too.

03:54.001 --> 03:56.304
(distant explosion)

03:56.337 --> 03:58.606
Those lights aren't going out.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.908
Lights aren't
going out.
Got to go back.

04:00.941 --> 04:03.911
Maybe make a run for it.
Too much ground to cover.
They'll shoot us down

04:03.944 --> 04:06.914
before we make the gap.
What's the plan then?
Give up and die?

04:06.947 --> 04:08.482
I can't wait
another four years.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.484
It was supposed to be one week.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.786
Poseidon has left
us here to die.
We still got

04:12.820 --> 04:14.622
one card left to play.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.957
I didn't want to play it,
but it's already in motion.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.858
(explosion rumbles)
Let's go.

04:20.761 --> 04:24.498
C-NOTE:
Apparently, Kaniel Outis
was thrown into Ogygia

04:24.532 --> 04:26.567
for crimes
against the government.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.802
Shortly after, he was captured

04:28.836 --> 04:31.839
trying to escape, and
thrown into solitary.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.974
They just released him
into gen pop recently.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.509
Call him Michael, will you?

04:35.543 --> 04:37.645
But why didn't he acknowledge us

04:37.678 --> 04:40.280
when he saw us?
(soft scraping on floor)

04:40.314 --> 04:42.149
(soft scraping on floor)

04:48.989 --> 04:50.658
Stop!

04:52.493 --> 04:54.662
LINCOLN:
Get back here!

05:21.088 --> 05:23.491
Kid was spying on us.
Yeah.

05:23.524 --> 05:27.094
And he left something
under the doormat.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.182
*

06:19.146 --> 06:23.016
This is Michael's handwriting.
Swan was his calling card.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.251
He's reaching out to us.

06:24.284 --> 06:26.386
But why is he being
so mysterious?

06:27.588 --> 06:30.691
Back in the day, he never
talked to you straight, as in

06:30.724 --> 06:33.427
not in code?
He's worried about someone
intercepting his message.

06:33.461 --> 06:35.429
Yeah, but what does it mean?

06:35.463 --> 06:37.364
I don't know, but
we're supposed to know.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.633
Sheik of Light.
Sheik of Light.

06:39.667 --> 06:42.102
That sounds like a guy
on a mountain peak

06:42.135 --> 06:43.737
communing with God.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.939
Yeah, we got to get help.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.241
We're out of help.
Sheba.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.611
She's thinks I'm
abetting a terrorist.

06:50.644 --> 06:53.881
Well, then you have
to convince her that you're not.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.083
SHEBA:
You have got to leave, Papa.

06:56.116 --> 06:59.319
I will not run away.
The government
is being targeted.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.922
You are being targeted.

07:01.955 --> 07:04.424
I'm a no one.
You are government to them.

07:04.458 --> 07:07.995
You don't understand
being a Yemeni.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.930
(panting)

07:09.963 --> 07:13.100
You would run away when
she needs you the most?

07:13.133 --> 07:17.137
I understand that we are no good
to this country dead.

07:17.170 --> 07:20.073
Papa, there will come a time.
We go abroad,

07:20.107 --> 07:22.009
regroup
with an exile government.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.612
With what money, girl?

07:24.645 --> 07:27.615
It would cost
two years' salary.

07:29.950 --> 07:34.655
I'd rather die with my face to
the enemy than to run away.

07:34.688 --> 07:37.224
Papa...

07:38.458 --> 07:40.994
(sighs)

07:41.028 --> 07:43.997
(knocking at door)

07:44.031 --> 07:46.433
Hey.
SHEBA: I suggest you leave

07:46.466 --> 07:49.670
this country as quickly
as you can.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.705
What's he doing here?

07:51.739 --> 07:53.140
My friend needs your help.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.675
I gave him my help.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.176
You didn't tell me he was
working with the enemy.

07:56.209 --> 07:57.711
This man you claim
is your brother,

07:57.745 --> 08:00.548
Kaniel Outis,
worked with the rebels.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.149
His name's Michael Scofield.
I don't care!

08:02.182 --> 08:03.951
Not Kaniel Outis!

08:03.984 --> 08:06.486
There's nothing you can
say to me that will

08:06.520 --> 08:08.956
make me help you, okay?

08:08.989 --> 08:11.625
Is that right?

08:11.659 --> 08:14.394
This enough to get your family
out of the country?

08:18.866 --> 08:21.902
Deliver me this first.

08:24.538 --> 08:26.940
(school bell ringing)

08:29.509 --> 08:32.245
Ready, love?

08:32.279 --> 08:34.615
(phone chimes)

08:49.196 --> 08:51.865
MIKE:
What's that?
It's, uh... it's

08:51.899 --> 08:54.034
something your
Uncle Lincoln sent.

08:54.067 --> 08:57.004
Here.
I don't want to go.
I want to stay with you.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.506
You got to go to school.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.374
And I'm gonna be right
here when the bell rings.

09:01.408 --> 09:03.944
Okay? You walk
down those steps,

09:03.977 --> 09:05.913
you hop straight
into the car. Yeah?

09:08.148 --> 09:11.719
I love you.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.053
Make it a great day.

09:25.733 --> 09:28.035
LINCOLN (on video):
I got the note.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.302
(gasps)

09:29.336 --> 09:31.905
I got the note, Michael.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.815
We're here
to get you out of here.

09:41.849 --> 09:44.117
MICHAEL:
Look, my name isn't Michael,

09:44.151 --> 09:47.287
and I don't know who you are.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.089
I'm sorry.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.792
(phone rings)

09:56.263 --> 09:58.465
Hey.

09:58.498 --> 10:00.300
JACOB:
You know I'm a noted economist?

10:00.333 --> 10:01.969
I mean, that's what it says
in the paper.

10:02.002 --> 10:05.806
"Noted Economist
Attacked in Home." (laughs)

10:05.839 --> 10:08.075
I didn't even know
economists made the news.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.477
That's the first and last time,
hopefully.

10:10.510 --> 10:15.015
(laughs) I've been trying
to piece this thing together.

10:15.048 --> 10:17.450
You remember
those government guys,

10:17.484 --> 10:18.919
those think tank guys,

10:18.952 --> 10:21.188
trying to pick my brain
about game theory,

10:21.221 --> 10:23.356
how they could use it
for foreign policy?

10:23.390 --> 10:25.592
Yeah, you bored the hell
out of 'em, right?

10:25.625 --> 10:29.162
Yeah, okay, but I mean,
did I hear something

10:29.196 --> 10:31.464
I shouldn't have?
I don't know. Did you?

10:31.498 --> 10:33.033
Like who shot JFK?

10:33.066 --> 10:35.335
(laughs)
I am trying to be serious here.

10:35.368 --> 10:36.870
No, you're doped up
on painkillers

10:36.904 --> 10:38.605
and you're thinking too much.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.008
I promise
this has nothing to do with you.

10:41.041 --> 10:45.478
You rest. I'm going to, um...

10:45.512 --> 10:47.380
I'm gonna run some errands,

10:47.414 --> 10:49.316
and then I'm gonna
come visit you, okay?

10:49.349 --> 10:51.719
Okay. Love you.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.855
Love you, too.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.001
Okay, no problem. Thanks.

11:08.035 --> 11:11.004
Hi. I, uh, I called earlier
about a missing U.S. citizen

11:11.038 --> 11:13.306
in the Middle East.
Yes. I'm Henry Kishida.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.675
Let me walk you
to the director's office.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.545
It's an unusual
situation,

11:18.578 --> 11:19.880
which you can appreciate,

11:19.913 --> 11:22.349
since your husband
is declared legally dead,

11:22.382 --> 11:23.683
and the person that
you're referring to

11:23.717 --> 11:25.085
goes by another name.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.354
KELLERMAN: I'll take it
from here, Henry.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.324
How are you, Sara?

11:31.358 --> 11:32.793
Kellerman?

11:38.631 --> 11:42.369
I'll leave you two be. Let me
know if you need anything, sir.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.404
Mm-hmm.
Sorry, how did I

11:44.437 --> 11:45.672
end up with you again?

11:45.705 --> 11:47.674
You asked
for the State Department's help.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.242
I wanted the State Department,
not you.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.011
Yeah, you've lived

11:51.044 --> 11:52.880
so many lives, I don't
know who you are.

11:52.913 --> 11:55.115
That'd be a consistent theme
for you, wouldn't it, given that

11:55.148 --> 11:56.850
you were married to a man
who never existed?

11:56.884 --> 11:58.786
What is that
supposed to mean?

11:58.819 --> 12:01.221
It means you should come in
and let me enlighten you

12:01.254 --> 12:03.356
to all things
Michael Scofield...

12:03.390 --> 12:05.492
Or should I say Kaniel Outis?

12:11.664 --> 12:13.200
You shouldn't drink

12:13.233 --> 12:14.902
bottled water-- the dioxins,
the BPAs in there...

12:14.935 --> 12:16.269
I'm touched by your concern.

12:16.303 --> 12:17.437
Have a seat.

12:17.470 --> 12:18.671
Good, thank you.

12:21.008 --> 12:22.876
You know, Sara...
(clears throat)

12:22.910 --> 12:25.312
...you and I have...
a checkered past.

12:26.613 --> 12:28.816
But I am evermore
a boring guy now, and...

12:28.849 --> 12:30.650
mellowed by life,
trust me.

12:30.683 --> 12:32.252
If you have something
you want to tell me

12:32.285 --> 12:34.054
about Michael,
I'd sure love to hear it.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.423
Okay. When your call came in

12:36.456 --> 12:38.258
and Kishida processed it...

12:38.291 --> 12:40.560
well, let's just say
there are certain keywords

12:40.593 --> 12:42.329
that get our system buzzing
pretty quickly.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.997
Kaniel Outis...

12:44.031 --> 12:46.266
Actually, can't stand it

12:46.299 --> 12:48.001
watching you drink
out of that.

12:48.035 --> 12:49.636
Hey, Kishida?

12:49.669 --> 12:53.006
Could you bring Sara a glass
for her water, please?

12:53.040 --> 12:54.074
Thank you.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.442
Kaniel Outis...

12:55.475 --> 12:56.743
is a known terrorist,

12:56.776 --> 12:58.478
ties to ISIL,
wanted in the killing

12:58.511 --> 12:59.746
of a senior CIA official.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.481
Michael's no killer.
You see,

13:01.514 --> 13:02.816
that's the problem.

13:02.850 --> 13:03.851
Because Kaniel Outis is.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.019
Thank you.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.087
KISHIDA:
You're welcome.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.488
And...

13:08.521 --> 13:10.590
this is Kaniel Outis.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.192
That's ridiculous.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.194
KELLERMAN:
The record here at State says

13:14.227 --> 13:16.964
that... that's
Kaniel Outis's face.
Okay,

13:16.997 --> 13:19.166
but you and I both know
who Michael Scofield was.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.334
No, that's just a memory.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.270
The official record-- history--

13:23.303 --> 13:24.838
it says otherwise now.

13:24.872 --> 13:28.308
Now, that's scary, to think
who could be behind that.

13:28.341 --> 13:31.344
Because only somebody
very formidable

13:31.378 --> 13:33.380
would be capable

13:33.413 --> 13:35.015
of officially turning
one man into another.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.985
It would take a genius...
like Michael.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.122
You're insinuating
that he did this?

13:42.155 --> 13:43.957
He disappeared,

13:43.991 --> 13:45.959
just quit on his life?

13:45.993 --> 13:47.527
I want answers just like you do.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.795
Who's capable of this?

13:48.828 --> 13:51.798
Only a handful of people
in the world.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.334
Sara? Sara!

13:57.170 --> 14:00.307
I figure we got
a day, maybe two,

14:00.340 --> 14:02.042
tops, to get out
of this hole.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.543
(explosion)

14:04.878 --> 14:07.347
At that point,

14:07.380 --> 14:10.183
either the shelling gets us...

14:10.217 --> 14:12.052
or ISIL does.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.523
Does any of this
faze you at all?

14:16.556 --> 14:18.091
The fact that we're
gonna die in here?

14:18.125 --> 14:20.360
We're not gonna die.
We're still getting out.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.628
All of us.

14:23.096 --> 14:25.232
How's that? The roof?

14:25.265 --> 14:27.400
The roof ain't happening.
The roof is happening.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.402
We don't have time to come up
with another escape plan.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.404
So you are nervous.

14:34.975 --> 14:38.145
Great, now I know
I'm in deep crap.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.781
I'm only doing this
for the money.

14:41.814 --> 14:44.952
Don't think you and I
are suddenly good.

14:44.985 --> 14:47.387
You just deliver
me the sheik.

14:47.420 --> 14:50.057
The sheiks are
well away from here.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.758
High desert.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.526
And I've never
heard of one

14:53.560 --> 14:55.062
being referred to
as Sheik of Light.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.564
Which means it's
probably a code.

14:57.597 --> 15:00.400
She knows your brother.

15:01.668 --> 15:02.902
This tape--

15:02.936 --> 15:05.638
it's the only thing
that doesn't belong.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.541
Your brother speaks
in riddles,

15:08.575 --> 15:10.477
does he?
Maybe it's Braille

15:10.510 --> 15:13.613
or, uh, Morse.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.049
Or just numbers.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.986
(speaking Arabic)

15:21.454 --> 15:23.456
I think it's a phone number.

15:29.829 --> 15:31.164
(line ringing)

15:33.433 --> 15:35.435
Voice mail.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.504
Mohammad El-Tunis.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.608
Director of Electrical Works
in Sana'a.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.276
Director of Electrical Works.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.145
"Sheik of Light."

15:53.186 --> 15:55.122
C-NOTE: Thanks for taking
the time to see us.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.990
Where is everybody?

15:57.024 --> 15:59.126
SECURITY GUARD: They are fleeing
ahead of the advance.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.827
We have been trying
to reach him.

16:00.860 --> 16:02.862
All we know is that
he went to the suburbs

16:02.895 --> 16:04.797
to try to find
his daughter.

16:04.831 --> 16:06.199
Do you have an address for her?

16:06.233 --> 16:08.635
We tried calling her,
but no answer.

16:08.668 --> 16:12.839
Address is here.

16:12.872 --> 16:14.974
You are not going to try
to find him, are you?

16:18.011 --> 16:20.347
God be with you, then.

16:24.017 --> 16:26.186
Circled the address.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.454
Good luck.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.122
You're coming with us.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.690
If you think I'm going
into the suburbs,

16:30.723 --> 16:31.958
you're crazy.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.526
What's wrong with the suburbs?

16:33.560 --> 16:35.962
The suburbs
are out there.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.697
The front line of the war.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.799
Nice knowing you,
Benjamin.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.201
I hope next time

16:41.234 --> 16:42.669
it's under
better circumstances.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.471
Pay up.
You have to get us
past the checkpoint.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.340
Two Americans-- we'll never
make it without you.

16:47.374 --> 16:48.675
I am not getting myself killed.

16:48.708 --> 16:49.909
Pay up.

16:49.942 --> 16:51.644
Deliver the sheik.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.380
Then you get your money.

16:59.686 --> 17:00.987
(mutters in Arabic)

17:01.020 --> 17:02.289
Get in.

17:19.271 --> 17:21.374
(phone rings)

17:25.044 --> 17:26.579
Yes?

17:26.613 --> 17:29.582
KELLERMAN: You should check
your e-mail, Sara.

17:31.918 --> 17:33.453
What am I looking at?

17:33.486 --> 17:36.523
Footage captured by
a hunter four years ago.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.926
One of those motion sensor
devices you hang on trees,

17:39.959 --> 17:42.028
takes intermittent
photos of prey.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.097
Hunter comes out one morning,
finds these images.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.710
This is the killing
I was telling you about.

17:57.744 --> 18:02.415
The victim's Harlan Gaines,
Deputy Chief of the CIA.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.117
And the killer...

18:04.151 --> 18:05.585
well, you can see,

18:05.618 --> 18:07.587
it's who we call
Michael Scofield,

18:07.620 --> 18:10.723
or Kaniel Outis, or...
This is exactly what they
did to Lincoln.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.925
And then there's the blood
evidence the next day.

18:12.959 --> 18:15.328
Kaniel or Michael or whatever
gets on a flight to Yemen.

18:15.362 --> 18:17.464
We all most nail him
when he lands.

18:17.497 --> 18:18.731
He gets away.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.267
His luggage doesn't,

18:20.300 --> 18:23.603
and Gaines' blood is all
over the clothes inside.

18:23.636 --> 18:26.439
The evidence is overwhelming.

18:26.473 --> 18:29.242
Whatever name
you want to call him,

18:29.276 --> 18:31.778
Michael's a murderer, Sara.

18:40.287 --> 18:41.488
Hey.

18:43.456 --> 18:46.092
Are you all right?

18:46.125 --> 18:48.161
You all right?

18:48.195 --> 18:49.762
Oh, this old thing?

18:49.796 --> 18:51.464
Yeah, I'm doing fine.

18:51.498 --> 18:54.133
What's going on?

18:54.167 --> 18:56.002
I need your advice.

18:56.035 --> 18:57.670
It's probably something
you're not gonna

18:57.704 --> 19:00.039
want to talk about.

19:00.072 --> 19:01.741
I could really use
your clarity right now.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.178
It's about Michael.

19:05.212 --> 19:07.347
(cell doors closing)

19:19.025 --> 19:20.427
* I've paid my dues *

19:22.862 --> 19:24.797
* I've done my sentence *

19:24.831 --> 19:26.633
WHIP: Still want to know how
he got that in here.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.668
Hugging naked
with the guards.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.403
Got to be, right?

19:30.437 --> 19:32.905
* But I've come through *

19:32.939 --> 19:35.842
What the hell is that?

19:35.875 --> 19:37.877
"We are the Champions."

19:37.910 --> 19:39.979
* We are the champions *

19:40.012 --> 19:43.182
You get stuck in a Porta-Potty
like this, you go Queen?

19:43.216 --> 19:44.417
I mean, where are the girls

19:44.451 --> 19:46.386
riding the washing
machines, right?

19:46.419 --> 19:50.457
Look at my screen again,
this goes in your eye.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.026
You know, the world
never ceases to amaze.

19:54.060 --> 19:55.428
You get stuck in a
Middle Eastern prison,

19:55.462 --> 19:57.864
the biggest S.O.B. is a Korean.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.999
He's in withdrawal.

20:00.032 --> 20:03.202
* 'Cause we are the champions *

20:05.938 --> 20:09.342
* Of the world... *

20:09.376 --> 20:11.077
MICHAEL: You know,
he's the biggest collector

20:11.110 --> 20:12.879
of Queen paraphernalia
in the world.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.248
They say his house in Seoul
is a shrine to Freddy Mercury.

20:15.282 --> 20:17.250
And he got in here how?

20:17.284 --> 20:19.085
Identity theft.

20:19.118 --> 20:21.588
Apparently he used to
sit on his couch,

20:21.621 --> 20:23.856
hack high net worth accounts
all over the world.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.192
Turned it into a collection
of Hummers, helicopters

20:26.225 --> 20:28.361
and, apparently,
Freddy Mercury's ashes.

20:28.395 --> 20:31.130
WHIP: Wait, you mean like
his burnt-up body?

20:31.163 --> 20:34.033
The story is Freddy's cremated,
but his ashes go missing.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.369
To this day no one knows
where they are.

20:36.403 --> 20:39.572
Ja admitted to me once
when he was high he bought them.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.374
Two million bucks.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.543
He's got Queen's lead singer
in his family room.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.244
How exactly do you
know all this?

20:45.278 --> 20:46.813
I asked him.

20:46.846 --> 20:49.215
He's a real mensch when
he's not in withdrawal.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.918
I didn't know
you talked to him.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.486
Amazing.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.555
Just when I think
I know your game, I don't.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.089
You know my game, Whip.

20:57.123 --> 20:58.591
See, right there, "Whip."

20:58.625 --> 21:00.226
I don't even know
why you call me that.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.761
Because you're my whip hand.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.430
My ace in the hole.

21:03.463 --> 21:06.098
Yeah, sure, okay.

21:08.100 --> 21:11.237
JACOB: See, in game theory,
it serves you to be two-faced.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.905
Be everyone's friend

21:12.939 --> 21:16.443
till the moment you're not.

21:16.476 --> 21:19.145
You make them love you so much
that when they're up against it,

21:19.178 --> 21:20.447
their loyalty
will make them act

21:20.480 --> 21:22.248
against their own
best interests.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.617
That's game theory.

21:24.651 --> 21:28.788
A cold, rational
focus on winning.

21:28.821 --> 21:31.524
Even if it's at
everyone else's expense.

21:31.558 --> 21:34.461
What I'm trying to understand
is what he stands to gain.

21:34.494 --> 21:36.963
Leaving his family,

21:36.996 --> 21:39.666
and-and the new identity.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.267
According to the little you've
told me, he was different.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.502
Always an agenda, right?

21:42.535 --> 21:45.372
Yeah.

21:45.405 --> 21:46.773
I mean, he apparently loved you.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.174
Of course he loved you.

21:48.207 --> 21:50.710
How could he not?

21:50.743 --> 21:53.646
But he also wanted you
to open that door

21:53.680 --> 21:56.849
in the prison for him.

21:56.883 --> 21:58.785
I mean, true game theory,

21:58.818 --> 22:01.821
everything, everyone

22:01.854 --> 22:05.625
is a contingency.

22:05.658 --> 22:08.294
You meet people,
you bring them into your life

22:08.327 --> 22:11.664
and you keep them percolating
until the moment

22:11.698 --> 22:14.834
you need to manipulate the
relationship to your advantage.

22:17.036 --> 22:19.806
I'm not judging, you know?
That's not my thing.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.774
I know.
You know me. But...

22:23.910 --> 22:25.878
...schema as deep

22:25.912 --> 22:28.881
and as calculating
as that can, in the end,

22:28.915 --> 22:31.250
spin a man off into madness.

22:31.283 --> 22:33.586
He might initially think
smaller evils are okay

22:33.620 --> 22:35.422
in the service
of a greater good.

22:35.455 --> 22:38.024
Like breaking Lincoln out
of prison.

22:38.057 --> 22:40.993
But the dance of good and evil
could become jumbled,

22:41.027 --> 22:43.029
and the manipulation
itself becomes

22:43.062 --> 22:44.864
the most important thing.

22:44.897 --> 22:46.766
Becomes about winning

22:46.799 --> 22:49.702
rather than whether the game
should be won at all.

22:56.743 --> 23:00.747
I don't think I've seen you
this scared before.

23:06.252 --> 23:09.255
They say, for Ramadan, as an act

23:09.288 --> 23:11.691
of forgiveness,
they're going to release

23:11.724 --> 23:13.593
all prisoners from
solitary over there

23:13.626 --> 23:16.529
back into general
population.

23:16.563 --> 23:18.064
Worst of the worst.

23:18.097 --> 23:20.733
ISIL fanatics.

23:20.767 --> 23:23.235
Abu Ramal.

23:23.269 --> 23:25.237
They're going to kill me,
you know.

23:25.271 --> 23:29.776
Government
gave me 20 years

23:29.809 --> 23:33.379
for homosexuality.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.114
But the monsters in there,

23:35.147 --> 23:37.484
Ramal and his men,

23:37.517 --> 23:40.119
won't let me live 20 minutes.

23:41.153 --> 23:43.490
Please tell me

23:43.523 --> 23:46.058
you still plan
on getting us out of here.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.260
You were responsible
for killing the lights,

23:48.294 --> 23:50.262
and then your Sheik of Light
went missing

23:50.296 --> 23:52.665
at exactly
the wrong time.

23:52.699 --> 23:56.268
I don't know what
happened to him.

23:56.302 --> 23:59.739
Maybe I can find another way.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.641
There is something
you could do.

24:01.674 --> 24:03.409
Give me a piece
of that gum.

24:03.442 --> 24:07.013
Piece of gum is going
to get us out of prison?

24:07.046 --> 24:10.249
It'll start the process.

24:10.282 --> 24:12.251
Sometimes, my friend, I
can't tell which is bigger,

24:12.284 --> 24:14.587
your plans
or your lies.

24:14.621 --> 24:17.690
I take that personally,
you calling me a liar.

24:17.724 --> 24:20.693
And I'm gonna show you,
just like the butterfly's wings,

24:20.727 --> 24:23.462
this piece of gum is gonna start
a sequence of events

24:23.496 --> 24:25.898
that will finish
on the other side of the world.

24:35.875 --> 24:37.877
*

24:41.881 --> 24:44.483
(whispers):
Battery, please.

25:03.502 --> 25:06.706
Prison lighter.

25:12.745 --> 25:15.514
Whip, I need your socks.

25:21.087 --> 25:23.522
Sid, water can.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.497
How we doing
out there?

25:31.530 --> 25:33.800
We're all good. Quick though.

25:35.968 --> 25:37.970
Okay.

25:42.408 --> 25:43.776
Hey.

25:43.810 --> 25:45.511
You sure about this?

25:45.544 --> 25:46.579
There's no time left.

25:46.613 --> 25:48.214
The city's
about to collapse.

25:48.247 --> 25:51.618
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

25:54.654 --> 25:56.288
(gasps)

25:56.322 --> 25:57.957
(grunts)

25:59.058 --> 26:00.192
Ah! Got it.

26:00.226 --> 26:01.460
(grunts)
Come on, come on, come on.

26:01.493 --> 26:03.395
(yells)

26:03.429 --> 26:04.597
WHIP:
Go, go, go.

26:05.932 --> 26:08.134
Guards!

26:08.167 --> 26:10.402
We got a sick
one in here.

26:13.139 --> 26:14.907
What is this?

26:14.941 --> 26:16.743
He's burning up, he
needs the infirmary.

26:16.776 --> 26:19.111
Please.

26:23.650 --> 26:26.252
SHEBA:
This is it.

26:26.285 --> 26:28.454
Limit of government
control.

26:28.487 --> 26:31.590
Anything after this
is ISIL territory.

26:31.624 --> 26:33.626
Stop.

26:36.963 --> 26:39.531
Let me
do the talking.

26:43.670 --> 26:45.104
(speaking Arabic)

26:47.606 --> 26:49.876
(soldier speaking in Arabic)

26:52.879 --> 26:55.481
He's says us being
Westerners, a woman...

26:55.514 --> 26:58.184
we go inside, we
are not coming back.

26:58.217 --> 27:01.120
They're not
letting us through.

27:01.153 --> 27:04.924
Tell him I bet $500 bucks
we'll make it back in one piece.

27:04.957 --> 27:07.326
He doesn't have
$500 to bet.

27:07.359 --> 27:08.761
It doesn't matter.

27:08.795 --> 27:11.530
We don't make it back,
he keeps it.

27:15.501 --> 27:17.036
(speaking Arabic)

27:18.537 --> 27:21.741
(speaking Arabic)

27:22.742 --> 27:24.476
(speaking Arabic)

27:27.213 --> 27:29.381
He says we have a death wish.

27:29.415 --> 27:30.850
Fine.

27:42.695 --> 27:46.866
The city used to be beautiful,
alive.

27:46.899 --> 27:49.335
Look what they've done
to it.

27:55.274 --> 27:58.144
They're putting up portraits
of Abu Ramal.

27:58.177 --> 28:00.346
He's only gotten
more powerful

28:00.379 --> 28:03.249
since he got locked up
in Ogygia.

28:03.282 --> 28:05.117
LINCOLN:
God help us if he gets out.

28:25.872 --> 28:27.840
SHEBA:
ISIL.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.375
We're gonna get stopped.
Get down.

28:29.408 --> 28:30.810
Down now.

28:31.811 --> 28:33.612
Cover up.

28:37.116 --> 28:38.717
Can't believe this.

28:38.751 --> 28:40.152
I know him.

28:49.595 --> 28:50.763
Reza.

28:50.797 --> 28:53.265
It's Abu Amir now.

28:53.299 --> 28:56.335
What are you doing in
the suburbs, Sheba?

28:57.403 --> 28:59.438
Took a wrong turn.

29:00.472 --> 29:02.441
You got your hair covered up.

29:02.474 --> 29:05.544
That's good.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.980
Finally find God?

29:08.014 --> 29:10.216
Not your God.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.318
There is only one God.

29:12.351 --> 29:14.353
We're gonna take
the city, you know.

29:17.589 --> 29:20.159
You be nice...

29:20.192 --> 29:23.429
maybe I'll make a
good woman of you.

29:23.462 --> 29:25.664
Forgive the devil in you.

29:25.697 --> 29:29.836
Why don't I just
turn around now?

29:29.869 --> 29:31.904
We forgive each other.

29:31.938 --> 29:34.740
Forget each other ever existed.

29:34.773 --> 29:38.077
Beauty is not so
easily forgotten.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.846
YASSER:
Lover boy!

29:39.879 --> 29:41.280
We have to go.

29:41.313 --> 29:42.982
Government's moving in
at Aksa Park.

29:45.551 --> 29:47.353
Cut her loose.

29:47.386 --> 29:48.821
(yells in Arabic)

29:49.856 --> 29:51.958
Get the hell off
our territory.

29:51.991 --> 29:53.659
(engine starts)

30:03.702 --> 30:05.704
They are gone.

30:08.908 --> 30:11.443
We have to hurry.

30:11.477 --> 30:13.712
We're lucky he didn't
kill me right then.

30:13.745 --> 30:15.147
Why?

30:16.582 --> 30:19.085
SHEBA:
Maybe I'll tell you one day.

30:20.186 --> 30:21.553
(groaning)

30:21.587 --> 30:23.455
(automatic gunfire outside)

30:23.489 --> 30:25.457
They're destroying our city.

30:25.491 --> 30:29.695
Your ISIL friends
are destroying our city.

30:29.728 --> 30:30.796
And you come in here

30:30.829 --> 30:33.332
wanting help.

30:33.365 --> 30:36.068
Just give me a little something.

30:36.102 --> 30:38.004
Is there a doctor here?

30:38.037 --> 30:39.705
I'm burning up.

30:39.738 --> 30:41.807
You should have
thought about that

30:41.840 --> 30:45.311
when you supplied guns to them,

30:45.344 --> 30:46.745
assassinated
good men.

30:46.778 --> 30:48.647
Those charges were
a misunderstanding.

30:48.680 --> 30:51.017
Oh, Allah.
Kaniel Outis says

30:51.050 --> 30:53.219
it was
a misunderstanding.

30:53.252 --> 30:54.720
Was it also
a misunderstanding

30:54.753 --> 30:57.156
when you tried to escape
the moment

30:57.189 --> 30:59.525
you got into this prison? Hmm?

30:59.959 --> 31:03.229
(groans)

31:03.262 --> 31:05.664
An honest man doesn't
try to escape.

31:05.697 --> 31:08.834
He asks for a lawyer.
But you,

31:08.867 --> 31:10.903
you tried to escape
the very first week.

31:17.443 --> 31:20.446
I'd have left you in solitary
forever if it was up to me.

31:22.148 --> 31:24.483
(yells)

31:25.817 --> 31:28.120
(whipping continues)

31:28.154 --> 31:29.255
(grunts)

31:39.165 --> 31:42.134
(Michael groans)
(door opens)

31:52.411 --> 31:54.981
(medicine cabinet opens)

31:55.014 --> 31:56.949
(Michael grunts)

32:07.793 --> 32:08.995
(engine idling)

32:11.663 --> 32:13.599
(engine turns off)

32:16.268 --> 32:18.370
The address
at the end of the block.

32:19.538 --> 32:20.772
Rebels...

32:20.806 --> 32:22.241
right in front
of the house.

32:22.274 --> 32:23.675
LINCOLN:
Son of a bitch.

32:23.709 --> 32:25.511
Anything easy
in this country?

32:25.544 --> 32:27.913
The question is:
is the sheik even inside?

32:27.946 --> 32:31.050
Only one way to find out.

32:36.488 --> 32:38.090
SHEBA:
They find us up here,

32:38.124 --> 32:39.992
there's no
explaining ourselves.

32:40.026 --> 32:41.960
We're all dead.

32:46.999 --> 32:48.000
(grunts)

32:58.044 --> 32:59.478
(grunting)

32:59.511 --> 33:01.847
(muttering)

33:01.880 --> 33:03.882
Shh, shh, shh.

33:03.915 --> 33:05.684
Quiet.

33:05.717 --> 33:07.553
You... You are not ISIL?

33:07.586 --> 33:10.989
No. But you're
Mohammad El-Tunis, I take it?

33:15.094 --> 33:17.996
We are from the city center.
We are here to get you out.

33:18.030 --> 33:19.365
Not without my daughter.

33:19.398 --> 33:21.667
We can bring her. Where is she?

33:21.700 --> 33:23.369
She's out there.
Where?

33:24.903 --> 33:27.005
In the basement of the
schoolyard, across the street.

33:28.874 --> 33:30.576
Pinned since ISIL arrived.

33:30.609 --> 33:32.344
I came to get her out.

33:32.378 --> 33:35.047
And I got pinned, too.

33:35.081 --> 33:36.715
C-NOTE: I hate to say it, Linc,
but I think we might've

33:36.748 --> 33:38.250
just got pinned as well.

33:38.284 --> 33:39.918
(soldiers shouting)

33:50.562 --> 33:53.132
*

34:09.114 --> 34:10.748
You okay?

34:13.918 --> 34:15.920
(grunts)

34:18.257 --> 34:20.592
You look like you could use
a few sharp edges

34:20.626 --> 34:22.793
knocked off your world.

34:22.828 --> 34:25.831
You don't look so good yourself.

34:28.967 --> 34:31.237
(inhales, exhales)

34:31.270 --> 34:33.972
Say what you want about Yemen,

34:34.005 --> 34:35.806
they're not shy
about prescriptions.

34:35.841 --> 34:38.076
It's the good stuff.
Morphine derivative.

34:41.480 --> 34:45.050
I need access to your cell phone
and a credit card number.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.386
Why?

34:47.418 --> 34:51.456
I want to order a pizza.

34:51.489 --> 34:53.492
(shouting in Arabic)

34:57.196 --> 34:58.730
There's a back door,

34:58.764 --> 35:01.600
toward the schoolhouse.
Come on.

35:05.304 --> 35:06.638
LINCOLN:
Too late.

35:06.672 --> 35:08.507
Go to the rooftops.

35:08.540 --> 35:09.908
C-NOTE: They're all
over the Rover.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.910
We'll never get to it.
I can get
in that pickup,

35:11.943 --> 35:13.078
make a ruckus on my way out.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.147
Any luck,
they'll be all over me.

35:15.181 --> 35:16.315
Then you got a clean shot
to the Rover.

35:16.348 --> 35:18.684
(slamming on door)

35:18.717 --> 35:19.685
Go. Go!

35:19.718 --> 35:20.752
I'm not leaving

35:20.786 --> 35:21.853
without my daughter.

35:21.887 --> 35:23.455
You don't know
what ISIL will do to her

35:23.489 --> 35:24.823
for educating those girls.

35:24.856 --> 35:26.825
I'll get her out, I promise.

35:26.858 --> 35:28.160
(grunting)

35:29.828 --> 35:32.531
LINCOLN: Go!
MOHAMMED: Okay! Okay.

35:33.832 --> 35:35.501
(speaking in Arabic)

35:41.740 --> 35:43.542
(horn blaring)
(shouting in Arabic)

35:48.480 --> 35:50.649
Your father sent me.
I'm getting you out of here.

35:50.682 --> 35:51.883
Come on! Come on!

36:05.497 --> 36:07.065
(engine starts)

36:07.098 --> 36:09.100
LINCOLN:
Get down! Stay down!

36:13.572 --> 36:15.241
(gunshots)

36:22.714 --> 36:23.815
He's got to make it.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.351
You know you got to make it.
Come on.

36:27.453 --> 36:28.754
There he is! There he is!

36:31.089 --> 36:32.090
Yeah, baby!

36:39.130 --> 36:40.299
Oh, no. This isn't good.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.034
This isn't good.

36:53.312 --> 36:54.780
(shouting in Arabic)

36:59.318 --> 37:01.253
SHEBA:
This government checkpoint.

37:01.287 --> 37:03.355
They'll think we're suicide
bombers. We have to stop.

37:03.389 --> 37:04.723
C-NOTE:
Are you out of your mind?

37:06.091 --> 37:08.093
Don't shoot at us!

37:08.126 --> 37:09.661
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

37:14.566 --> 37:15.934
LINCOLN:
Stay down!

37:22.274 --> 37:24.075
(speaks in Arabic)

37:46.197 --> 37:48.334
(laughing)

37:56.842 --> 37:58.844
(sobbing)
(speaks Arabic)

38:14.693 --> 38:16.962
Forgive me, uh...

38:16.995 --> 38:19.431
Their parents
have been killed.

38:19.465 --> 38:21.667
I'm trying to figure out
how I can help them.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.435
They can stay here for now.

38:23.469 --> 38:26.037
As long as you tell me
who you know in Ogygia

38:26.071 --> 38:27.773
and why they want
you so bad.

38:27.806 --> 38:30.509
(sighs) I'm a man
with, uh...

38:30.542 --> 38:32.844
troublesome children.

38:34.312 --> 38:37.549
They're beautiful.

38:37.583 --> 38:40.151
But perhaps too modern
for this country.

38:40.185 --> 38:44.690
My daughter tries
to educate girls.

38:44.723 --> 38:46.191
And my son,

38:46.224 --> 38:48.794
he falls in love
with another man.

38:48.827 --> 38:52.564
They gave him 20 years
in Ogygia Prison.

38:54.332 --> 38:55.867
I went to visit him
a few weeks ago.

38:55.901 --> 38:58.737
He said maybe
there is a way out.

38:58.770 --> 39:00.972
A way I could help.

39:01.006 --> 39:02.408
A man is not a man

39:02.441 --> 39:05.243
if he would let his family die.

39:06.512 --> 39:08.146
You agreed to help him.

39:08.179 --> 39:09.515
How?

39:09.548 --> 39:11.983
He said if I could
arrange a blackout,

39:12.017 --> 39:14.586
he... he knew someone
who could get him out.

39:14.620 --> 39:15.721
An American?

39:15.754 --> 39:17.423
I don't know.

39:17.456 --> 39:19.891
I-I was supposed to
do this a week ago,

39:19.925 --> 39:23.395
but then this happened
with my daughter.

39:23.429 --> 39:24.763
Thank God you found us.

39:24.796 --> 39:27.198
There's still
time to do it.

39:27.232 --> 39:29.200
They're waiting for you
in there.

39:29.234 --> 39:30.702
Then I have to go now.

39:30.736 --> 39:32.771
He said I was
to give a signal

39:32.804 --> 39:35.040
exactly 24 hours
before the blackout.

39:35.073 --> 39:37.275
I will pulse
the power grid twice.

39:37.308 --> 39:40.912
This city
may not have 24 hours in it.

39:50.288 --> 39:51.256
(school bell rings)

39:51.289 --> 39:52.257
TEACHER:
Bye, guys.

39:52.290 --> 39:54.292
Bye.

39:56.795 --> 39:58.764
God knows I'm no perfect
judge of character,

39:58.797 --> 40:01.733
but Michael?
(chuckles)

40:01.767 --> 40:04.369
If any of what they're
saying is true...

40:04.402 --> 40:06.438
So there's more
to find out, Sara.

40:06.472 --> 40:10.041
I mean, the important thing is
that you are gonna survive this,

40:10.075 --> 40:12.143
however it turns out.

40:12.177 --> 40:13.479
Mm-hmm.

40:13.512 --> 40:16.247
And we're here for you. Okay?

40:16.281 --> 40:17.583
Let's go.
Thank you.

40:17.616 --> 40:18.617
Call me, okay?

40:18.650 --> 40:20.151
Yeah.

40:22.954 --> 40:24.723
Hey, can I just scoop
Mike real quick?

40:24.756 --> 40:27.058
All the kids have been released.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.661
You don't have him?

40:29.695 --> 40:30.929
Mike?

40:32.297 --> 40:33.699
I'll go this way.
Okay, yeah.

40:34.966 --> 40:36.635
Mike?

40:36.668 --> 40:40.171
Hey, hey, have you seen Mike?

40:40.205 --> 40:41.439
Mike!

40:43.208 --> 40:45.243
Mike!

40:45.276 --> 40:47.846
Mike!

40:47.879 --> 40:50.749
(panting):
There...

40:50.782 --> 40:52.417
What are you doing?
You scared me.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.185
I was looking
for where the man went.

40:54.219 --> 40:55.353
What man, baby?

40:55.386 --> 40:56.755
The man that gave me this.

40:56.788 --> 40:59.324
The pizza man.

40:59.357 --> 41:01.192
The pizza man?

41:10.135 --> 41:11.937
(whispering):
Michael.

41:11.970 --> 41:14.973
What are you into?

41:20.078 --> 41:23.048
ISIL is getting
closer by the hour.

41:23.081 --> 41:25.450
And the rebels
in here know it.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.653
When they take over,
they'll kill all of us.

41:29.020 --> 41:32.891
Infidels, the sinners,
the foreigners.

41:43.835 --> 41:44.903
Praise Allah.

41:44.936 --> 41:47.138
Someone found my father.

41:47.172 --> 41:49.708
Means the escape is on.

41:52.243 --> 41:53.845
24 hours from now.

41:53.879 --> 41:55.413
(door opens)

41:55.446 --> 41:57.482
But this may be too late.

41:57.515 --> 42:00.351
Ramadan has begun.

42:00.385 --> 42:02.520
The guards are releasing
the prisoners.

42:04.122 --> 42:06.491
Abu Ramal and his men,

42:06.524 --> 42:08.226
they'll kill me.

42:08.259 --> 42:10.028
And you.

42:37.388 --> 42:39.390
