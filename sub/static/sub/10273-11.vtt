WEBVTT

00:03.836 --> 00:05.596
<i>Thank you for getting</i>
<i>a place for us to meet.</i>

00:05.621 --> 00:08.996
Why is it so hard?
It just doesn't feel like it did before.

00:09.116 --> 00:12.194
If we start killing scientists
on U.S. soil...

00:13.795 --> 00:15.329
who knows where it leads?

00:15.397 --> 00:16.864
What the hell
did you think you were doing?

00:16.932 --> 00:18.032
They got my partner.

00:18.100 --> 00:20.101
What would you have done?

00:21.636 --> 00:22.870
Who killed Vlad?

00:22.938 --> 00:24.839
I don't know.
Don't lie to me.

00:24.906 --> 00:27.675
You're separating?
Not exactly. We're, uh --

00:27.743 --> 00:28.843
Hitting the pause button.

00:29.845 --> 00:31.245
Home, sweet home.

00:31.313 --> 00:32.680
General Zhukov.

00:32.747 --> 00:34.882
Our war is not so cold
anymore, Elizabeth.

00:34.950 --> 00:37.685
Our enemy
is strong and capable.

00:41.857 --> 00:44.775
They kill us, we kill them.

00:44.860 --> 00:46.911
It's the world we live in.

00:46.995 --> 00:48.763
But even in this world,

00:48.830 --> 00:51.132
there are lines
that can't be crossed.

00:51.199 --> 00:55.269
At this moment,
three high-level KGB officers

00:55.337 --> 00:57.438
are being targeted in Moscow,

00:57.506 --> 01:00.408
including Viktor Zhukov,
head of Directorate "S."

01:07.215 --> 01:10.885
There will be no sanctuary,
no safety,

01:10.952 --> 01:13.054
not even in their own homes.

01:14.856 --> 01:17.491
We're going to find them,

01:17.559 --> 01:19.894
and we're going to kill them.

01:19.961 --> 01:21.979
This isn't a cold war.

01:22.064 --> 01:25.166
There's nothing cold about
the covert, violent exchanges

01:25.233 --> 01:27.601
between the United States
and the Soviet Union.

01:27.669 --> 01:31.906
They've killed not only
our agents, but our citizens.

01:31.973 --> 01:34.575
And for that, they'll pay.

02:52.277 --> 02:53.308
Wow.

02:53.428 --> 02:54.462
No. Stop.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.458
No, really. Wow.
You look amazing.

02:56.526 --> 02:58.227
Well, I have
more paint on my face

02:58.295 --> 02:59.395
than a new Buick, so...

02:59.462 --> 03:01.030
Come on. Let's go.

03:01.081 --> 03:02.231
Okay.

03:05.395 --> 03:07.496
What is this Harvey Wallbanger?

03:07.564 --> 03:11.166
Vodka, Galliano,
and orange juice.

03:11.234 --> 03:13.735
Galliano.
That sounds so continental.

03:13.803 --> 03:15.971
This is my Italian lover,
Galliano.

03:20.043 --> 03:22.778
Have you ever dated anyone
from a foreign country?

03:22.845 --> 03:25.647
Never. You?

03:25.715 --> 03:27.683
Mm. Yeah. In college.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.451
There was
this visiting professor,

03:29.519 --> 03:31.186
Juhani, from Finland.

03:31.254 --> 03:33.188
He was the first guy
I ever slept with

03:33.256 --> 03:34.823
on a list of two.

03:35.892 --> 03:38.694
I hope Juhani's life
is happier than Stan's.

03:40.229 --> 03:42.631
That was the Harvey Wallbanger
talking.

03:42.699 --> 03:44.199
Sorry.

03:44.267 --> 03:46.635
Speaking of -- excuse me.
Can we get two more of these?

03:46.686 --> 03:47.803
You got it.

03:47.870 --> 03:49.638
Thank you.

03:49.706 --> 03:51.039
Have you ever thought about
cheating?

03:51.107 --> 03:53.308
Wow.

03:53.376 --> 03:55.811
Um...

03:55.878 --> 03:59.448
I mean,
I think anyone who's married

03:59.515 --> 04:01.483
and says they haven't is lying.

04:01.551 --> 04:03.285
Mm.

04:03.353 --> 04:04.953
But there is a difference
between thinking about it

04:05.021 --> 04:07.122
and actually going through.

04:09.685 --> 04:11.686
Is something going on, Sandra?

04:11.753 --> 04:13.621
No. Oh, I'm sorry.

04:13.689 --> 04:16.089
I'm just blah, blah,
blah, blah.

04:20.462 --> 04:21.796
Let's go dance.

04:21.863 --> 04:24.699
What?

04:24.766 --> 04:27.702
<i>As is the case with</i>
<i>most mammals, the cheetah...</i>

04:27.769 --> 04:29.704
What does this
have to do with insurance?

04:29.771 --> 04:33.441
The insurance company
pays for the show.

04:33.508 --> 04:34.875
Why?

04:34.943 --> 04:37.111
Well, that's what capitalism's
all about.

04:37.179 --> 04:39.247
You make something,
then you sell it for profit.

04:39.314 --> 04:41.249
How do you make insurance?

04:41.316 --> 04:43.150
You <i>buy</i> insurance, doofus.

04:43.218 --> 04:44.552
Do we buy their insurance?

04:44.620 --> 04:48.222
No. We just watch their show.

04:48.290 --> 04:49.223
I'm hungry.

04:49.291 --> 04:50.958
Me too.

04:51.026 --> 04:55.229
Well, I have orange juice
and...peanut butter.

04:55.297 --> 04:56.764
The orange juice is warm.

04:56.832 --> 04:58.666
What do you do for food?

04:58.734 --> 05:00.568
The Jennings family

05:00.636 --> 05:02.970
are natural foragers.

05:03.038 --> 05:04.672
They find comestibles --
Comestibles?

05:04.740 --> 05:07.575
Food wherever it can be found.

05:07.643 --> 05:08.542
No! Aah!

05:08.610 --> 05:11.912
♪ Ever change your mind ♪

05:11.964 --> 05:16.167

- Hello?

05:36.338 --> 05:37.705
Oh, h-hi.

05:37.773 --> 05:39.307
I thought you were at
the "Rocky Horror" show.

05:39.374 --> 05:41.342
Doesn't start till midnight.

05:41.410 --> 05:44.445
Oh. And Mrs. Peters
is driving you and Harry?

05:44.513 --> 05:46.947
Yes, mom.

05:47.015 --> 05:50.785
Could you, uh, put dad
on the phone for me, please?

05:50.836 --> 05:52.520
He called to say
he's working late.

05:52.587 --> 05:54.622
Shocker, right?

05:56.591 --> 05:58.392
Okay, well,
have a good time, then.

05:58.460 --> 06:00.027
Okay?

06:04.032 --> 06:05.132
Who wants Skittles?

06:05.200 --> 06:07.335
Me. And Cheetos.

06:07.402 --> 06:08.502
Can I have a Mars bar?

06:08.570 --> 06:11.806
No, they're out of Mars bars.

06:11.857 --> 06:13.908
Hey, look over there.

06:17.079 --> 06:18.846
What's he doing?

06:18.914 --> 06:20.414
Taking a whiz.

06:20.482 --> 06:22.750
Hey, buddy,
you want to pack it up?

06:24.419 --> 06:26.487
Nice one, dad.
Let's go.

06:44.172 --> 06:46.724
Hey.

06:46.808 --> 06:47.742
What happened?

06:50.579 --> 06:51.746
I've been asking you that
for months.

06:51.813 --> 06:53.013
I'm still waiting for an answer

06:53.081 --> 06:57.785
that doesn't
smell like bullshit.

06:57.853 --> 07:00.755
Okay.

07:03.258 --> 07:05.626
Seems like you've had
a few drinks, hon.

07:08.530 --> 07:10.598
I called headquarters.

07:12.434 --> 07:14.902
They said
that you left hours ago.

07:14.970 --> 07:16.403
Well, they were mistaken.

07:16.455 --> 07:18.272
Bullshit.

07:18.340 --> 07:19.874
Look, Sandra, whatever it is
you're thinking,

07:19.941 --> 07:24.211
I'm...telling you
you don't understand.

07:26.181 --> 07:27.915
You're a goddamn liar.

07:27.983 --> 07:30.885
Can we just take a breath here
for a second?

07:34.322 --> 07:37.224
You know, every time
that I call headquarters,

07:37.292 --> 07:38.826
it's so funny, because they say

07:38.894 --> 07:41.095
that you left four hours ago,

07:41.163 --> 07:42.563
and I keep telling myself,

07:42.631 --> 07:43.931
"Oh, yeah, he must be out
on a stakeout,"

07:43.999 --> 07:45.766
or, "Oh, he must be out
on a case,"

07:45.817 --> 07:47.768
or, "Oh, he must be surveilling
some bad guys or something."

07:47.819 --> 07:50.139
But you know what? There aren't
enough bad guys in the world

07:50.172 --> 07:52.306
to explain all your time away
from here, from us, from me.

07:52.374 --> 07:53.974
And it dawned on me!

07:54.042 --> 07:55.576
I was like, "Wake up, Sandra!"
Because you know what?

07:55.644 --> 07:57.278
The only bad guy here
is you, Stan,

07:57.345 --> 08:00.781
and the opposite of the man
that I married and a coward,

08:00.849 --> 08:02.316
and I am pretty sure

08:02.384 --> 08:03.634
that I can't stand
the sight of you right now!

08:03.718 --> 08:04.952
Sandra, please --
can you please --

08:05.003 --> 08:06.420
Stop! You know what?
What goes on in you?

08:06.471 --> 08:07.621
What goes on in there, huh?!
Sandra --

08:07.672 --> 08:08.806
Do you know?
Do you have any idea?

08:08.890 --> 08:10.341
No, you don't.
You don't.

08:10.425 --> 08:13.260
'Cause there's nothing.
There's nothing there.

08:13.328 --> 08:14.478
Just nothing.

08:14.563 --> 08:16.463
I just need you
to listen to me.

08:16.515 --> 08:17.865
No.

08:17.933 --> 08:20.768
Because I am sick

08:20.836 --> 08:24.638
of kidding myself about you
and about this marriage

08:24.706 --> 08:27.274
and about the last 19 1/2 years
of my life,

08:27.342 --> 08:30.678
and I am -- I don't know
how you can dare

08:30.745 --> 08:33.313
turn my life into some...

08:44.526 --> 08:47.845
Zhukov is dead?

08:47.929 --> 08:50.731
Monsters is what they are.

08:50.799 --> 08:53.968
Assassins with
federal I.D. badges.

08:56.037 --> 08:57.738
Who did it?

08:57.806 --> 09:00.708
I'm told
the CIA Director of Planning

09:00.775 --> 09:02.243
for the Soviet Union,
Richard Patterson,

09:02.310 --> 09:03.677
was the architect
of the operation.

09:03.745 --> 09:04.979
He has to die.

09:05.728 --> 09:09.016
Not by us.
I'm sorry to say there'll be no retribution.

09:09.084 --> 09:10.351
Moscow's decided to end

09:10.418 --> 09:12.920
the escalation of violence
for now.

09:12.988 --> 09:15.523
So he gets to walk off free?

09:15.590 --> 09:17.892
Moscow says
that we can't let this

09:17.959 --> 09:19.560
spiral any further
out of control.

09:19.628 --> 09:20.728
We have to stay focused
on the big --

09:20.795 --> 09:21.962
Moscow is wrong.

09:23.565 --> 09:26.534
Do you agree with
the centre's perspective?

09:26.601 --> 09:29.737
I do not agree or disagree.

09:29.804 --> 09:31.572
I follow orders.

09:31.640 --> 09:34.508
Speaking of which,
you and Philip

09:34.559 --> 09:37.678
directly contradicted my order
regarding Gregory Thomas.

09:37.746 --> 09:39.280
It was the right thing to do.

09:39.347 --> 09:41.916
Defying orders is never
the right thing to do.

09:41.983 --> 09:44.518
You're lucky
that your act of street theater

09:44.586 --> 09:47.221
didn't bring down
the entire operation.

09:47.289 --> 09:52.459
Sometimes the smartest officers
do the stupidest things.

09:53.695 --> 09:55.579
We're sorry.

09:56.748 --> 09:58.232
Viktor Zhukov was a great man

09:58.300 --> 10:00.134
who meant a great deal to you.

10:00.201 --> 10:03.203
I know he'd have full confidence
you'll do the right thing.

10:03.271 --> 10:05.105
I thought the Americans
understood

10:05.173 --> 10:08.409
that even covert wars
have rules.

10:08.476 --> 10:10.010
I was wrong.

10:24.893 --> 10:26.327
You wanted to see me, Colonel?

10:26.394 --> 10:28.062
Sit.

10:37.472 --> 10:39.740
How is the training going?

10:39.808 --> 10:41.108
Good.

10:41.176 --> 10:43.210
Any problems?

10:44.346 --> 10:45.346
No.

10:48.049 --> 10:51.318
Change is hard, daunting.

10:51.386 --> 10:54.755
It uproots us.

10:54.823 --> 10:57.458
Have I failed
in some respect, sir?

10:57.525 --> 11:00.227
No. You are exemplary.

11:02.197 --> 11:04.098
But I see that you are unhappy.

11:04.165 --> 11:07.768
Things are not as you expected?

11:07.836 --> 11:10.671
No.

11:10.739 --> 11:13.674
Philip is a good man.

11:13.742 --> 11:15.876
You are a good match.

11:28.957 --> 11:30.391
Nine years ago,

11:30.458 --> 11:35.229
fate or circumstance
brought Malysh and me together.

11:35.296 --> 11:38.399
And my life
has never been the same.

11:38.466 --> 11:42.369
Malysh has taught me
what it means to love.

11:42.437 --> 11:45.039
Do you know what love is,
Elizabeth?

11:47.208 --> 11:49.043
It's a feeling.
Yes.

11:49.110 --> 11:52.579
The most profound feeling.

11:52.647 --> 11:56.483
He isn't particularly smart,
or he isn't pretty.

11:56.551 --> 11:58.085
But I love him.

11:58.153 --> 12:00.688
Do you know why?

12:00.755 --> 12:04.658
Because I take care of him
every day.

12:04.726 --> 12:08.228
And he, in his way,
is taking care of me.

12:08.296 --> 12:11.198
If you take care of something,
Elizabeth,

12:11.266 --> 12:14.601
one day you will discover
that you love this creature

12:14.669 --> 12:18.072
and your life
would be empty without him.

12:26.648 --> 12:28.582
Zhukov was murdered.

12:28.650 --> 12:30.451
What?

12:30.518 --> 12:34.521
The Americans killed him.

12:34.589 --> 12:36.724
I'm going to find
the man responsible

12:36.791 --> 12:38.525
and kill him.

12:38.593 --> 12:40.961
Are those our orders?

12:41.029 --> 12:44.965
Zhukov understood me.

12:45.033 --> 12:48.402
He loved me.

12:48.470 --> 12:50.904
I'm telling you,
the man who ordered his murder

12:50.972 --> 12:53.040
will pay with his life.

12:53.108 --> 12:54.508
Elizabeth, come on.
You can't --

12:54.576 --> 12:57.277
No, <i>they</i> can't, Philip.

12:57.345 --> 12:59.713
And I'm gonna make sure
they know it.

13:04.414 --> 13:07.231
Patterson keeps an irregular schedule.

13:07.471 --> 13:09.522
He takes a number of different
routes to Langley.

13:09.607 --> 13:11.930
Sometimes stops off
to get a coffee or a doughnut,

13:12.050 --> 13:13.250
but not always.

13:13.318 --> 13:14.885
He arrives at the office
by 7:00ish,

13:14.952 --> 13:16.225
doesn't leave for meals.

13:16.345 --> 13:19.114
His dry-cleaners is next to
a bank with a security guard.

13:19.234 --> 13:21.590
His gym has
exterior video surveillance.

13:21.713 --> 13:23.246
Don't ask me why.

13:23.314 --> 13:25.465
He frequents
the Wheel House on Comstock.

13:25.550 --> 13:26.883
He always goes by himself,

13:26.951 --> 13:28.631
but often leaves
in the company of a woman,

13:28.653 --> 13:29.586
rarely the same one.

13:29.654 --> 13:31.488
Patterson is tough to get.

13:31.556 --> 13:32.956
You have to let this go.

13:33.024 --> 13:34.091
I can't do that.

13:34.158 --> 13:36.293
Patterson is a careful man,

13:36.361 --> 13:37.761
but he has one weakness.

13:37.829 --> 13:39.096
He likes women.

13:39.163 --> 13:41.131
Not for the long haul --
for a pit stop.

13:41.199 --> 13:42.332
He can be reckless.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.734
Interesting word.

13:43.801 --> 13:45.502
My best shot to grab him
is at the Wheel House.

13:45.570 --> 13:48.071
"Grab"? You've got to be
out of your mind.

13:48.139 --> 13:50.474
It's doable.
No, it's not. It's reckless.

13:50.541 --> 13:53.410
If you're saying
I can't do it alone,

13:53.478 --> 13:54.911
you're right.

13:54.979 --> 13:56.346
Look, all I --
No.

13:56.414 --> 13:58.148
Philip --
We just did this.

13:58.216 --> 13:59.850
I know. I know we did.

13:59.917 --> 14:01.157
We just got done
defying orders.

14:01.219 --> 14:03.470
This is different,
and you know it.

14:03.554 --> 14:04.788
You want to kill him?

14:04.856 --> 14:06.523
Put a scope on a rifle.
Take him out.

14:06.591 --> 14:08.124
That's the point.
I can't.

14:08.176 --> 14:09.993
His movements are unpredictable.
That's bullshit.

14:10.061 --> 14:11.328
You're putting yourself in danger
because you've made it personal.

14:11.396 --> 14:12.329
Do you see that?

14:12.397 --> 14:14.164
If you're asking me

14:14.232 --> 14:16.466
do I want to look in Patterson's
eyes before I kill him,

14:16.534 --> 14:20.103
the answer is yes.

14:21.239 --> 14:22.706
Hello?

14:22.774 --> 14:23.857
Hey.

14:23.941 --> 14:25.275
Hey. Where's mom?

14:25.326 --> 14:27.361
Aerobics class, I think.

14:27.445 --> 14:29.613
How was
the "Rocky Horror" movie?

14:29.680 --> 14:30.981
It was fun.

14:31.049 --> 14:33.116
We threw toilet paper
and toast at the screen.

14:33.184 --> 14:35.018
Y-you did what?

14:35.086 --> 14:36.553
Never mind.

14:36.621 --> 14:39.156
Matthew.

14:39.223 --> 14:40.690
Are you wearing makeup?

14:40.758 --> 14:42.025
Yeah, dad.

14:42.093 --> 14:44.027
It's a drag show.
Everyone wears makeup.

14:44.095 --> 14:46.363
And, no,
that doesn't mean I'm gay.

16:14.986 --> 16:16.486
What was so urgent?

16:18.022 --> 16:22.959
Mom, daddy,
I'd like you to meet Clark.

16:25.163 --> 16:27.781
- Hi.
- Hi, there. - Hi.

16:31.118 --> 16:34.304
To quote Tevye from
"Fiddler on the Roof," to life.

16:34.372 --> 16:35.472
Oh!
To life.

16:35.540 --> 16:36.973
To life.

16:37.041 --> 16:38.241
They saw the show last night.

16:38.292 --> 16:40.126
Oh, loved it.
Mm.

16:40.211 --> 16:41.912
"If I Were a Rich Man"
was in perfect pitch,

16:41.963 --> 16:45.582
but I thought Tevye was
a little flat with "Tradition."

16:45.633 --> 16:47.784
Daddy is a baritone
in the church choir.

16:47.835 --> 16:48.952
We're Lutherans.
Right.

16:49.020 --> 16:50.954
How were you raised, Clark?

16:51.022 --> 16:54.291
Uh...Protestant.
Presbyterian.

16:54.358 --> 16:56.293
Yeah,
that's not so far off, hm?

16:56.360 --> 16:58.662
So, would anyone like coffee?

16:58.729 --> 17:00.313
I would.
Oh, let me.

17:00.398 --> 17:01.982
No, no. You stay. Talk.

17:05.536 --> 17:07.103
We've heard
so much about you, Clark.

17:07.171 --> 17:08.338
Really?

17:08.406 --> 17:09.973
Don't worry.
Nothing about work.

17:10.040 --> 17:12.943
Martha keeps saying
what a wonderful guy you are.

17:12.993 --> 17:15.028
We've never seen her so happy.

17:15.112 --> 17:16.029
Daddy.
What?!

17:16.113 --> 17:18.164
You said he's a great guy.

17:18.249 --> 17:20.317
She's over the moon for you.

17:20.384 --> 17:23.787
Well, your daughter
is a very special lady,

17:23.838 --> 17:26.890
and I am so sorry to say,
but I really need to get going.

17:26.958 --> 17:27.891
That's okay.

17:27.959 --> 17:29.325
Oh, no.

17:29.377 --> 17:30.544
Yeah, it's just --

17:30.628 --> 17:31.995
it's just work stuff
that can't wait.

17:32.046 --> 17:33.680
But it was a real pleasure
meeting you both.

17:33.764 --> 17:35.682
It was great to meet you, too,
Clark.

17:35.766 --> 17:36.850
I hope to see you soon.

17:36.934 --> 17:38.184
I'm sure we will.

17:38.269 --> 17:39.185
Take care.

17:39.270 --> 17:40.353
Bye-bye.
Bye.

17:43.891 --> 17:45.225
Okay, before you say anything,
I know.

17:45.309 --> 17:46.693
I know no one's
supposed to know about you,

17:46.777 --> 17:48.228
but they could just tell
that I was seeing someone,

17:48.312 --> 17:49.846
and then, of course, they wanted
to meet you and --

17:49.914 --> 17:54.084
Martha,
your parents are lovely.

17:54.151 --> 17:55.418
Like you.

17:55.486 --> 17:56.987
Mm.

17:57.038 --> 17:58.021
Bye.

17:59.206 --> 18:00.991
Bye.

18:07.498 --> 18:12.102
I'm pregnant --
number two.

18:12.169 --> 18:13.903
Congratulations.

18:13.971 --> 18:15.538
Mm.

18:15.606 --> 18:17.440
How old is your daughter now?

18:17.508 --> 18:19.042
3.

18:19.110 --> 18:21.278
She's in a play group.

18:21.345 --> 18:24.848
There are no demands on
children in America, no chores.

18:24.915 --> 18:27.450
All we do all day long
is watch them play.

18:27.518 --> 18:29.919
Play is serious.

18:29.987 --> 18:31.788
It's how we learn
to read one another...

18:31.856 --> 18:32.856
Oh.

18:32.923 --> 18:35.358
...and the world.

18:35.426 --> 18:38.128
I don't remember much of that
as a child.

18:38.195 --> 18:39.462
Because of the war,

18:39.530 --> 18:44.034
you never had
the pleasure of play.

18:44.101 --> 18:45.935
Things were hard.

18:46.003 --> 18:49.306
Very hard.

18:49.373 --> 18:52.142
Philip must be excited about
your family growing.

18:52.209 --> 18:54.077
I haven't told him.

18:54.145 --> 18:56.813
I will, of course.

18:56.881 --> 18:58.882
Just not yet.

18:58.949 --> 19:00.650
In case you change your mind.

19:07.291 --> 19:10.393
You remember my dog, Malysh?

19:10.461 --> 19:11.394
Mm-hmm.

19:11.462 --> 19:13.630
He died.

19:13.698 --> 19:15.665
I'm sorry.

19:15.733 --> 19:17.467
I know you loved him.

19:17.535 --> 19:21.404
He was my companion.

19:21.472 --> 19:23.573
We all die alone, Elizabeth.

19:23.641 --> 19:29.746
Before that, we make choices.

19:38.689 --> 19:40.023
I'll give you 20 minutes,

19:40.091 --> 19:41.591
then I'll pull the car
in the alley in the back.

19:41.659 --> 19:44.794
20 minutes.

19:44.862 --> 19:48.832
It's not too late.
You can still turn back.

19:48.899 --> 19:50.900
We both know that's not true.

19:54.071 --> 19:55.038
But you can.

19:57.108 --> 19:59.509
20 minutes.

20:10.921 --> 20:13.022
Good luck.

Air Supply.

24:44.579 --> 24:47.231
I...keep hitting

24:47.299 --> 24:49.734
Nobody's talking.

24:49.801 --> 24:52.403
Maybe you're talking to
the wrong people.

24:52.471 --> 24:55.239
Maybe that's what
I'll find out.

24:55.307 --> 24:57.908
I have a lot more access

24:57.976 --> 24:59.777
Look, Nina,
the Rezidentura was warned.

24:59.845 --> 25:01.979
You had an opportunity
to make an exchange,

25:02.047 --> 25:03.114
and you didn't do it.

25:03.181 --> 25:06.384
I don't know what to tell you.

25:06.451 --> 25:08.219
The...

25:10.989 --> 25:12.790
I-I don't...

25:14.426 --> 25:17.194
I don't think we're ever gonna
really know what happened, Nina.

25:21.283 --> 25:24.235
It...

25:24.302 --> 25:25.803
It's frustrating.

25:25.871 --> 25:28.639
I would use a different word.

25:32.411 --> 25:35.813
What is it you want from me?

25:38.850 --> 25:40.284
Well, I've been thinking

25:40.352 --> 25:44.789
that this part of things...

25:44.856 --> 25:47.391
should stop.

25:50.896 --> 25:52.930
Is that what you want?

25:54.332 --> 25:57.168
It's not what I...

26:01.907 --> 26:04.375
It's the right thing to do.

26:08.513 --> 26:11.015
Okay.

26:20.258 --> 26:24.228
I don't have
anything anymore, Stan.

26:24.296 --> 26:27.498
No country to go back to.

26:27.566 --> 26:31.535
My family,
I will never see again.

26:31.603 --> 26:36.407
I only have fear...

26:36.475 --> 26:37.641
and you.

26:43.548 --> 26:45.416
My wife...

26:45.484 --> 26:47.017
She knows.

26:47.085 --> 26:49.453
Yes.

26:53.625 --> 26:56.727
Family is everything.

28:13.989 --> 28:16.373

28:18.410 --> 28:20.678
I'm here.

28:22.047 --> 28:24.715
Who are you?
What do you want?

28:37.696 --> 28:39.897
What do you hear, Richard?

28:42.317 --> 28:44.685
What do I hear?
Yes.

28:44.769 --> 28:46.820
Your footsteps.

28:46.905 --> 28:49.740
Yes, but what do you <i>hear?</i>

28:51.743 --> 28:52.810
I don't understand.

28:52.878 --> 28:54.545
Listen.

28:56.848 --> 28:58.182
Do you hear that?

29:00.619 --> 29:03.153
Your chest ring and falling.

29:03.221 --> 29:05.122
Your pulse quickening.

29:05.190 --> 29:07.625
Your heart beating.

29:11.880 --> 29:14.198
How does it feel to be alive...

29:14.266 --> 29:17.301
but know
that you're going to die?

29:17.369 --> 29:19.670
You just don't know
exactly when.

29:19.738 --> 29:20.738
Everyone dies.

29:20.805 --> 29:22.640
That's true.

29:22.707 --> 29:24.675
But you're fortunate.

29:24.743 --> 29:26.911
You know what's coming.

29:29.614 --> 29:32.316
But you won't get any goodbyes.

29:32.384 --> 29:33.884
It will just happen,

29:33.952 --> 29:35.319
just like it did

29:35.387 --> 29:37.721
for the people you slaughtered
in Moscow.

29:37.789 --> 29:39.189
Do you want information?
No.

29:39.257 --> 29:40.190
Money?

29:40.258 --> 29:42.159
No.

29:42.227 --> 29:44.028
What do you want?

29:44.095 --> 29:47.998
I want to know how it feels,
how <i>you</i> feel.

29:49.417 --> 29:52.536
I want to know how it feels

29:52.604 --> 29:57.174
to order the deaths
of innocent people.

29:57.225 --> 30:00.010
Those generals who died
in Moscow weren't innocent.

30:00.078 --> 30:02.046
They knew the risks.

30:02.113 --> 30:04.615
Like you.

30:06.518 --> 30:08.235
And you.

30:11.856 --> 30:13.440
Do you know who I am?

30:13.525 --> 30:15.726
Richard Patterson, CIA,

30:15.794 --> 30:17.578
Director
of Operations and Planning

30:17.662 --> 30:18.912
for the Soviet Union.

30:18.997 --> 30:22.416
That is my title.
But do you know who I am?

30:22.500 --> 30:24.735
I'm a bureaucrat.

30:24.786 --> 30:26.904
I decide nothing.
I do nothing.

30:26.972 --> 30:28.238
You give orders.

30:28.306 --> 30:30.040
I give orders
that are given to me.

30:30.108 --> 30:31.542
I implement the will of others.

30:31.609 --> 30:33.277
But you --
your life is a lie.

30:33.345 --> 30:34.979
You kill.
That's who you are.

30:35.046 --> 30:36.814
That's what you know.
That's what you do.

30:36.881 --> 30:38.082
You should stop.

30:38.149 --> 30:39.950
You grind people into dust.

30:40.018 --> 30:42.086
You have no heart,
no soul, no conscience.

30:42.153 --> 30:43.554
You should stop talking
right now.

30:43.605 --> 30:45.255
Your hands
are covered in blood.

30:45.323 --> 30:46.991
Do you care about anything?

30:47.058 --> 30:48.559
Do you love anyone?

30:48.626 --> 30:51.945
Does anyone love you?
I said stop talking!

31:17.722 --> 31:19.156
Oh, God.

31:19.224 --> 31:21.325
What happened?

31:22.660 --> 31:23.761
What happened?

31:25.163 --> 31:27.598
It's okay. I'll do it.
I'll do it.

31:27.649 --> 31:30.167
No.

31:30.235 --> 31:31.985
I thought
this was what you wanted.

31:32.070 --> 31:33.937
It's not him.
It's not about him.

31:33.988 --> 31:35.939
I don't care about him.

31:36.007 --> 31:37.808
About Zhukov?

31:37.876 --> 31:40.494
I was out of control.

31:44.682 --> 31:45.949
It's okay.

31:46.017 --> 31:47.618
It's okay.

31:49.287 --> 31:51.188
It happens.

32:33.870 --> 32:35.853
And they took you where?

32:36.083 --> 32:38.724
It was a warehouse, I think.

32:38.792 --> 32:40.192
It was industrial.

32:40.260 --> 32:41.994
How do you know?

32:43.174 --> 32:47.032
The sound of her footsteps,
the way her voice carried.

32:47.100 --> 32:49.745
It was large, empty.

32:50.041 --> 32:51.708
She was alone in the warehouse.

32:51.776 --> 32:53.176
No.

32:53.244 --> 32:54.811
The man was with her?
Yes.

32:54.879 --> 32:56.513
The same man?

32:56.581 --> 32:58.315
I think so. Yes.

32:58.382 --> 33:00.450
What were you doing
in the restroom?

33:00.518 --> 33:03.286
I was going
to have sex with her.

33:03.354 --> 33:04.721
And she attacked you.

33:04.789 --> 33:05.856
Yes.

33:05.923 --> 33:09.059
And she had help.

33:09.126 --> 33:10.327
Yes.

33:10.394 --> 33:13.330
And she said
she was gonna kill you.

33:13.397 --> 33:15.232
Yes.

33:15.299 --> 33:18.235
Because of the deaths
of the KGB agents in Moscow.

33:18.302 --> 33:19.202
I think so.

33:19.270 --> 33:21.471
You <i>think.</i>

33:21.539 --> 33:25.742
It was personal --
killing me.

33:25.810 --> 33:28.678
How do you know?

33:28.746 --> 33:31.314
By the sound of her voice.

33:31.382 --> 33:34.417
Assuming she was a KGB agent

33:34.485 --> 33:38.021
and she brought you
to a safe house to kill you,

33:38.089 --> 33:40.657
why do you think
she let you go?

33:43.928 --> 33:45.428
I don't know.

33:45.496 --> 33:49.432
So, a woman and a man.

33:49.500 --> 33:51.001
Yes.

33:51.068 --> 33:52.435
A couple.

33:58.059 --> 34:01.344
I love to come here
this time of year.

34:01.395 --> 34:03.446
Everything is
in the process of becoming.

34:03.514 --> 34:06.116
The garden is beautiful.

34:06.183 --> 34:08.851
The flowers will be temporary.

34:08.920 --> 34:11.221
We will have to enjoy them
while we can.

34:11.289 --> 34:12.906
Mm.

34:14.324 --> 34:16.860
How are you and Philip?

34:16.911 --> 34:18.661
The same.

34:20.063 --> 34:22.748
Do you know
why you were chosen for America?

34:22.833 --> 34:25.168
Because of my commitment.

34:26.203 --> 34:27.920
Yes.

34:28.005 --> 34:32.425
Loyalty, intelligence, skills.

34:32.510 --> 34:34.377
But most of all,

34:34.428 --> 34:36.713
you were chosen
because of your fear.

34:37.965 --> 34:40.100
My fear?

34:40.184 --> 34:42.886
Of surrender.

34:42.937 --> 34:45.722
Surrender for you
would be an act of suicide.

34:45.773 --> 34:47.607
Hm.

34:47.692 --> 34:51.194
But not everyone is your enemy.

34:54.364 --> 34:56.933
These buds
don't look like much now.

34:57.001 --> 34:58.785
But in a week or two,

34:58.869 --> 35:02.906
the garden will be
bursting with color.

35:02.957 --> 35:05.325
Nature is genius...

35:05.409 --> 35:07.310
and easy to overlook.

35:09.313 --> 35:13.183
I have no more stories
to tell you, Elizabeth.

35:13.250 --> 35:15.685
I lost my way a long time ago.

35:17.488 --> 35:21.725
I have lived for my work,
for the party.

35:22.994 --> 35:25.595
Now I miss what I never had.

35:36.273 --> 35:37.774
What's up?

35:37.842 --> 35:41.978
I wanted to say thanks...

35:42.046 --> 35:43.213
a lot.

35:45.182 --> 35:47.050
You didn't have to drive
all the way out here.

35:47.118 --> 35:49.386
I did, though.

35:50.855 --> 35:53.289
I-I brought beer.

35:53.357 --> 35:56.059
"Thanks a lot" beer?

36:03.884 --> 36:06.703
Do you, um, have an opener?

36:11.058 --> 36:12.676
Oh.

36:14.211 --> 36:15.545
Just like old times.

36:17.815 --> 36:20.016
At least I stopped using
my teeth.

36:28.225 --> 36:29.726
This place is, um...

36:29.794 --> 36:31.728
Homey?

36:35.900 --> 36:38.668
You going somewhere?

36:38.736 --> 36:41.171
I can't stay here anymore.

36:43.574 --> 36:45.375
I don't want to bring
the kids here again.

36:45.443 --> 36:47.010
Right.

36:47.078 --> 36:49.446
It was fun for a night or two,
but they need to feel --

36:49.513 --> 36:50.580
Rooted.

36:50.648 --> 36:54.184
I completely -- I --

36:54.251 --> 37:00.023
No, I think it's been
long enough, and...

37:00.091 --> 37:01.891
it's the right thing to do.

37:01.959 --> 37:05.361
Actually, you think, um,

37:05.429 --> 37:07.914
I could take you
back to the house

37:07.998 --> 37:09.733
and borrow the car
to move my bags?

37:09.800 --> 37:12.569
Because my --
my battery's dead.

37:12.636 --> 37:14.270
Yeah, your bags
will fit in the car,

37:14.338 --> 37:16.473
and you could just
deal with the battery tomorrow.

37:16.540 --> 37:18.441
Oh, you want to see it?

37:18.509 --> 37:19.909
See it?

37:19.977 --> 37:22.278
The apartment.

37:25.049 --> 37:28.818
Oh, you got an apartment.

37:33.057 --> 37:34.457
So, do you want to see it?

37:34.525 --> 37:35.892
No, I'm --

37:35.943 --> 37:37.444
you should definitely
take the car,

37:37.528 --> 37:40.263
and I should, um...

37:40.331 --> 37:41.297
I'll take the bus.

37:41.365 --> 37:42.599
I can drive you.

37:42.666 --> 37:46.236
No, no, no.
Bus is a breeze.

38:24.175 --> 38:26.276
You gave me
Richard Patterson's name

38:26.343 --> 38:28.945
and told me
not to act on that intelligence.

38:29.013 --> 38:31.314
But you were counting on
the fact that I would.

38:31.382 --> 38:33.950
Why?

38:34.018 --> 38:35.985
"Hello, Claudia,
how are you?"

38:36.036 --> 38:38.121
"I'm fine, Elizabeth.
And you?"

38:38.189 --> 38:40.557
Why did you want me
to kill Patterson?

38:40.624 --> 38:43.893
I admire your predictability,
Elizabeth.

38:43.961 --> 38:45.962
It's comforting.

38:46.030 --> 38:47.797
I let him go.

38:50.568 --> 38:51.701
Why?

38:51.769 --> 38:54.070
It's not what you wanted.
I know that.

38:54.138 --> 38:56.039
But it's what I did.

38:57.975 --> 39:00.476
I don't understand you.

39:00.544 --> 39:03.947
You're not the only one
who loved Zhukov.

39:06.383 --> 39:08.184
You and Viktor?

39:08.252 --> 39:11.054
Don't look so surprised.

39:11.121 --> 39:12.722
We were a good match.

39:12.790 --> 39:15.925
When you're a loner,
there's nothing more satisfying

39:15.993 --> 39:21.731
than finding another loner
to be alone with.

39:21.799 --> 39:24.534
That's not true.

39:24.602 --> 39:26.736
Viktor was easy to love.

39:28.973 --> 39:31.174
Yes, he was.

39:31.242 --> 39:33.076
Mm.

39:33.143 --> 39:35.078
But you're not.

39:37.114 --> 39:40.850
I don't believe you ever had
a relationship with Zhukov.

39:40.918 --> 39:43.720
I think you wanted me
to go against KGB orders

39:43.787 --> 39:45.722
and kill Patterson
so you could -- what? --

39:45.789 --> 39:48.224
ship me off to Moscow,

39:48.292 --> 39:52.629
bring me to heel like
your dog on some short leash?

39:52.696 --> 39:56.065
Believing in people isn't easy
for you, is it, Elizabeth?

39:56.133 --> 39:58.134
I am on your side.

39:58.202 --> 40:02.272
We've invested everything
in you, count on you.

40:02.339 --> 40:04.874
My only ambition
is to make sure

40:04.942 --> 40:08.044
you're the best officers
you can possibly be --

40:08.112 --> 40:10.947
are trained to be.

40:11.015 --> 40:13.483
If I have to be tough
to accomplish this,

40:13.550 --> 40:16.119
I will be.

40:16.186 --> 40:18.888
You really believe all that,
don't you?

40:20.291 --> 40:23.760
You've only ever wanted
to hurt us.

40:23.827 --> 40:27.163
And maybe in your mind you think
it's better for the centre

40:27.231 --> 40:30.099
if we don't really get along,
but you hate us.

40:30.167 --> 40:32.468
I don't understand why.

40:32.536 --> 40:35.338
Because we're better at this
than you ever were?

40:35.406 --> 40:37.774
Because I beat your face in?

40:37.841 --> 40:42.645
You're still new at this,
my dear.

40:42.713 --> 40:45.848
So much to learn.

40:45.916 --> 40:50.753
This isn't gonna go well
for you, old lady.
