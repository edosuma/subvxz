13:09.581 --> 13:10.991
I didn't talk to anyone.

13:11.083 --> 13:12.323
Theytook
the damn thing away,

13:12.417 --> 13:14.453
I got nothing
to do with it anymore.

13:14.544 --> 13:15.579
What is it with you people?

13:16.797 --> 13:18.958
Did somebody at
the department lean on you?

13:19.049 --> 13:20.129
Were you reimbursed?

13:20.217 --> 13:21.878
Not nearly enough.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.213
You cops gotta get
your stories straight.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.044
Go talk to that bald bastard.

13:27.933 --> 13:29.469
You mean Dillon?
Yeah.

13:31.561 --> 13:32.550
(SIGHS)

13:35.399 --> 13:36.388
(BEEPS)

13:36.483 --> 13:38.189
CARLOS: Hey, it’s me.
What'd you find?

13:38.276 --> 13:39.527
There's at least
three others.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.310
I spoke to two of them.

13:41.405 --> 13:44.021
There were pay-offs.
Dillon's involved.

13:44.199 --> 13:45.484
How’d it go
with the boy genius?

13:45.575 --> 13:48.703
Alec claims
he doesn't know a thing
about any problems with HALO,

13:48.787 --> 13:51.244
or Jason's extracurricular
trip to the park.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.704
(SCOFFS)
And you believe him?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.035
lscanned him.

13:54.126 --> 13:55.241
He checked out.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.495
So that's a dead end.

13:56.586 --> 13:57.917
It’s not sitting right.

13:58.046 --> 14:00.458
Just because Alec
believes HALO is harmless,

14:00.549 --> 14:01.914
doesn't mean that it is.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.059
Whatever they're paying you,
I'll triple it.

14:15.147 --> 14:16.603
BRAD: I need your help.

14:21.111 --> 14:22.271
You're Kiera's, uh...

14:22.571 --> 14:23.606
You're Matthew Kellog.

14:23.947 --> 14:25.357
My reputation precedes me.

14:25.449 --> 14:26.484
I hope that's a good thing.

14:26.575 --> 14:28.440
I know you better
than you realize.

14:28.952 --> 14:30.453
I'm not exactly
from around here.

14:30.704 --> 14:31.784
You and me both.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.203
That's why I came to you.

14:33.290 --> 14:35.201
I need resources.
I need information.

14:36.585 --> 14:38.075
I don't even know you.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.458
You will.

14:41.590 --> 14:42.705
What do you need, exactly?

14:42.799 --> 14:45.415
I need to find a freelancer,
retrieve something they took.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.667
Can you help me with that?

14:46.762 --> 14:47.797
Those guys tend to find you.

14:47.888 --> 14:49.298
And it doesn't
usually go too well.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.720
They don't worry me.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.304
All right, say I do
find them.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.475
How would I contact you?

14:56.563 --> 14:58.178
We pre-arrange a meeting.

15:04.738 --> 15:06.228
Take this.
I'll call you.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.902
We need to act fast, sir.
Our future depends on it.

15:09.993 --> 15:10.982
Hang on.

15:11.078 --> 15:13.114
I don't want to be rude here,
but who the hell are you?

15:13.205 --> 15:15.070
You'll have to wait
for another time.

15:19.753 --> 15:22.586
We're seeing a reaction
in less than six percent
of our beta testers.

15:22.672 --> 15:23.923
Six percent.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.963
So that means if the
launch goes the way we want,

15:26.051 --> 15:29.714
by Christmas we'll have
30,000 psychotic people
walking around?

15:29.805 --> 15:31.011
It seems a bit high.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.713
It'll never get to that.

15:32.808 --> 15:35.265
It looks like a problem
with the neural interfacing.

15:35.352 --> 15:37.889
It's like, um, if someone
had a gluten allergy,

15:37.979 --> 15:39.139
but, you know,
in the brain.

15:39.231 --> 15:40.937
We could find a work-around.

15:41.024 --> 15:42.685
Are you dumbing
this down for me or her?

15:43.693 --> 15:45.194
No, I would never.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.652
Really.
It's an alpha model.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.775
The first quantal phones
shipped as bricks.

15:49.866 --> 15:51.367
They recovered.

15:54.621 --> 15:55.952
You should have told me
about this, Jason.

15:56.039 --> 15:57.779
You should
have come clean.

15:57.874 --> 15:58.863
I know.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.540
How are you?
I'm fine.

16:01.628 --> 16:02.743
Look, I don't want you
to keep wearing this

16:02.838 --> 16:04.453
if it's hurting you.

16:04.548 --> 16:05.663
But we really
need to fix it

16:05.757 --> 16:07.088
and you're the lead
on that interface.

16:07.175 --> 16:09.712
Yeah, I can,
um, take breaks.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.543
A few hours on,
a few hours off.

16:11.638 --> 16:12.627
(STAMMERING)

16:12.722 --> 16:14.223
It'll be fine.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.509
Yeah.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.636
No more secrets
between us, okay?

16:19.479 --> 16:20.889
All right.

16:22.566 --> 16:23.976
Piron has a
dangerously flawed product

16:24.067 --> 16:25.398
that they've
invested millions in,

16:25.485 --> 16:28.067
and they have Dillon
on the inside
sweeping up the damage.

16:28.280 --> 16:31.568
You better be 100% sure
before you
make any accusations.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.656
l have three people that
say he headed off charges,

16:33.743 --> 16:36.155
and payoffs were handled
by Piron lawyers.

16:38.081 --> 16:39.537
Any of them
willing to go on record?

16:40.584 --> 16:41.915
No.

16:42.711 --> 16:44.747
You shoot the king,
you gotta kill the king.

16:45.630 --> 16:46.836
Alec is involved.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.629
What is with your
hate-on for Alec?

16:48.717 --> 16:50.548
I thought you chose this
Alec over the other one.

16:50.635 --> 16:53.798
That ceremony,
for the other Kiera,

16:53.889 --> 16:56.175
did you ever stop and ask
yourselfwhy he did it?

16:56.266 --> 16:59.303
It was about
respect, closure.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.385
Or maybe a great way
to cover something up.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.185
Make evidence
disappear forever.

17:03.273 --> 17:04.228
Evidence of what?

17:04.316 --> 17:06.773
Her CMR chip, he removed it.

17:07.485 --> 17:08.474
He didn't.

17:08.570 --> 17:11.186
Yes. This HALO technology
is three generations

17:11.281 --> 17:13.067
ahead of
what's available today.

17:13.408 --> 17:15.148
How do you
think that happens?

17:15.243 --> 17:16.358
Oh, that little...

17:19.956 --> 17:21.207
Okay.

17:21.291 --> 17:22.701
Where are you going?

17:22.834 --> 17:24.950
(SIGHS) I'm going
about this a different way.

17:25.253 --> 17:26.538
How so?

17:28.256 --> 17:29.666
I'm calling in a favor.

17:29.758 --> 17:30.793
You?

17:30.884 --> 17:32.590
I've got another lead
to chase down.

17:32.677 --> 17:34.508
It's a long shot, but...

17:38.183 --> 17:39.639
CARLOS: So you gave up
andjoined the enemy.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.967
JULIAN: Well,
my principles
are unchanged.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.394
I don't work for Piron,
ljust watch over them.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.142
CARLOS: Really? Huh.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.268
'Cause from the outside,

17:47.359 --> 17:50.567
it seems like Alec bought you
and put you on a leash.

17:50.654 --> 17:52.064
You're trying
to provoke me.

17:52.155 --> 17:53.611
VVhy?

17:53.949 --> 17:56.656
(SIGHS) I've got
three crimes, all of them
swept under the rug,

17:56.785 --> 17:59.151
all of them wearing HALO
beta test devices.

17:59.996 --> 18:01.327
That's not a coincidence.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.995
I'll talk to Alec about it.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.077
Kiera already did that.

18:05.168 --> 18:07.750
l was looking for something
a little more covert.

18:08.338 --> 18:10.750
Piron is putting profit
ahead of public safety.

18:11.174 --> 18:13.540
I thought that's what
you were there to prevent.

18:14.344 --> 18:15.754
I'll look into it.

19:07.647 --> 19:08.978
YOUNG BRAD:
Who are you?

19:10.984 --> 19:12.520
ljust came to get
something I left here.

19:12.736 --> 19:14.101
That's my hiding spot.

19:14.404 --> 19:16.736
Yeah, lfigured
we could share it.

19:18.366 --> 19:19.401
That was underneath?

19:19.492 --> 19:20.823
Uh-huh.

19:20.910 --> 19:23.617
So, uh...
Did you live here before?

19:24.581 --> 19:25.741
You could say that.

19:26.583 --> 19:27.993
Billy Kemp do that?

19:29.085 --> 19:30.950
Let me tell you something.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.666
Billy Kemp is a coward.

19:34.758 --> 19:36.498
You remember that the
next time you see him.

19:36.593 --> 19:37.708
And then you
ball up your fist,

19:37.802 --> 19:39.542
and you let him have it.
Hit him?

19:39.888 --> 19:41.503
It's gonna
hurt your hand, but
he won't come at you again.

19:42.307 --> 19:44.764
That is terrible advice.

19:45.602 --> 19:47.263
Don't worry,
I'm with the police.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.605
You in trouble?
BRAD: Nah.

19:49.898 --> 19:51.138
But we do have some
bad guys to catch, though.

19:51.441 --> 19:53.147
BRAD'S MOTHER:
Bradley Tonkin,
you get in here

19:53.276 --> 19:55.062
before your lunch
gets cold!

19:55.236 --> 19:56.316
I should go.

19:56.905 --> 19:59.191
Brad, don't be the
one who hits first, okay?

19:59.866 --> 20:01.276
That makes you the bully.

20:02.035 --> 20:03.775
But if he comes at you...
Then it's okay?

20:04.245 --> 20:05.746
You have
to protect yourself.

20:22.138 --> 20:23.969
That was interesting.

20:26.142 --> 20:28.428
I thought
you'd been snatched.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.681
The broken glass,
the blood?

20:30.772 --> 20:32.182
Uh,yeah.

20:32.273 --> 20:33.353
Sorry.

20:34.317 --> 20:35.306
How'd you find me?

20:35.443 --> 20:36.603
ldidn't find you.

20:36.694 --> 20:37.729
lfound him.

20:38.321 --> 20:39.356
I'm impressed.

20:39.447 --> 20:40.607
I'm good at myjob.

20:40.782 --> 20:42.067
And sorry?

20:43.159 --> 20:44.319
What's going on?

20:45.245 --> 20:46.735
Am I going to have
to apologize again

20:46.830 --> 20:48.741
if I say it's not you,

20:49.666 --> 20:51.406
even though it's not
exactly true?

20:51.835 --> 20:52.995
I came here
to help you.

20:53.086 --> 20:55.452
And you've done that,
all the way down the line.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.546
And it was a mistake
and l have to go.

21:00.510 --> 21:02.751
There is something that
you aren't telling me.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.005
There's a lot.

21:08.351 --> 21:10.091
When are you from?

21:10.603 --> 21:11.934
And who sent you back?

21:12.021 --> 21:13.761
We both walk away.

21:13.857 --> 21:15.142
That's the only choice.

21:15.483 --> 21:17.348
Oh, it's no choice
at all.

21:18.486 --> 21:19.692
Putyour
weapon down, Travis.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.189
You think I
came here alone?

21:21.573 --> 21:22.562
(GUN COCKING)

21:26.744 --> 21:28.780
You must be sweet
on this one, Protector.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.866
ltwasn't even hard
to sneak up on you.

21:43.845 --> 21:46.552
So. You caught me.

21:47.557 --> 21:48.637
What now?

21:48.725 --> 21:51.683
It's like Wile E. Coyote
finally catching
the Road Runner.

21:54.731 --> 21:55.971
It's a cartoon.

21:56.065 --> 21:57.771
It's pretty
existential fare, actually.

21:57.859 --> 21:59.395
There's a coyote
who's just relentless...

21:59.486 --> 22:02.068
We're savoring
the moment, Protector.

22:02.489 --> 22:04.650
What do you want with me?

22:04.741 --> 22:06.823
What makes you think we're
interested in you at all?

22:06.910 --> 22:08.116
SONYA: Where did you
get these?

22:08.203 --> 22:09.784
KIERA: From Alec.

22:09.871 --> 22:11.156
They're experimental.

22:11.247 --> 22:12.908
They're his.

22:16.211 --> 22:17.200
They are.

22:17.462 --> 22:19.544
INGRAM: The microcircuits
are advanced beyond
anything now,

22:19.631 --> 22:22.543
but it's a weird,
hybridized nano-tech.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.052
Like a caveman
building a cell phone.

22:25.136 --> 22:26.125
SONYA: From the future?

22:26.221 --> 22:27.882
Yes.
Don't.

22:30.892 --> 22:32.007
Who sent you?

22:38.942 --> 22:43.527
There's aspects to this time
that I truly appreciate.

22:44.656 --> 22:48.490
Like how you still have to
do certain things by hand.

22:48.576 --> 22:49.907
(GRUNTING)

22:51.287 --> 22:52.663
(WHIMPERING)

22:56.209 --> 22:57.540
(GRUNTING)

23:01.631 --> 23:02.746
You can take a hit.

23:02.840 --> 23:03.875
Apparently.

23:10.598 --> 23:12.463
Time for some answers,
future man.

23:12.559 --> 23:14.049
(GRUNTS)

23:14.143 --> 23:16.634
What are you doing here?

23:18.147 --> 23:19.808
Cleaning up your mess.

23:21.985 --> 23:24.192
HALO beta test,
list participants.

23:24.821 --> 23:25.936
COMPUTER: HALO participants.

23:26.030 --> 23:29.898
All right, narrow to those
who have reported
anti-social behavior.

23:29.993 --> 23:31.199
COMPUTER: No findings.

23:31.286 --> 23:32.571
Not a one, all right?

23:32.662 --> 23:36.029
Widen the search
to former participants.

23:36.124 --> 23:37.955
COMPUTER: You do not
have clearance.

23:38.042 --> 23:40.078
No access.

23:40.169 --> 23:42.160
So much for openness, Alec.

23:43.631 --> 23:45.371
Jason, you okay?

23:46.134 --> 23:47.999
Police knock you
around a little bit?

23:48.094 --> 23:49.379
Nah, it's all cleared up.

23:49.470 --> 23:52.837
Let's, uh, move along,
move along.
Nothing to see.

23:52.932 --> 23:55.139
But you're not
the only one, are you?

23:55.476 --> 23:57.387
Others were arrested,
did things,

23:57.478 --> 23:59.093
they paid to
make it go away, right?

23:59.188 --> 24:00.439
Oh, I don't know.

24:02.984 --> 24:04.940
You're not wearing
your HALO.

That's what created
the alternate future
that this guy comes from.

36:10.753 --> 36:12.334
I guess your
secret deal with Sadler

36:12.421 --> 36:14.286
just got a little
complicated, Garza.

36:15.132 --> 36:16.167
INGRAM:
You work for Sadler?

36:16.258 --> 36:17.213
No, of course not!

36:17.301 --> 36:19.587
He sent her
back here from 2077.

36:21.263 --> 36:24.426
If only you people knew
what you don't know.

36:25.934 --> 36:27.310
Hey.

36:27.394 --> 36:30.602
Homeowner reported two
strangers in the back yard
talking to her kid.

36:30.689 --> 36:31.678
Yeah, and?

36:31.774 --> 36:35.107
A unit responded,
spoke to the witnesses,
identified these two.

36:36.528 --> 36:39.019
Agent Cameron's car
was in the alleyway.

36:39.114 --> 36:40.365
There's no sign of her.

36:42.993 --> 36:44.028
Shit.

36:44.119 --> 36:45.780
All right,
text me the address.

36:50.626 --> 36:52.036
Come on, come on.

36:52.127 --> 36:53.378
Kiera, where are you?
Call me back.

36:53.462 --> 36:54.542
We're in this
together, Lucas.

36:54.630 --> 36:55.961
You can't believe
what she's saying.

36:56.048 --> 36:57.333
I can't believe what
any of you say!

36:59.176 --> 37:00.211
Even though I've
got the evidence!

37:00.302 --> 37:01.382
You are going to want
to be careful with that.

37:01.470 --> 37:03.085
Lucas.
Dontyousee?

37:03.972 --> 37:05.963
If this timeline
has been altered,

37:06.058 --> 37:07.844
then we're just pawns
in someone else's game.

37:07.935 --> 37:09.891
Either Sadler's, or hers.

37:09.978 --> 37:11.843
Lucas, no. No.

37:11.939 --> 37:14.476
He's right.
And none of you get it.

37:15.317 --> 37:18.150
Everything you've done
is for nothing.

37:18.237 --> 37:20.068
(GROANS)
Take it easy!

37:20.155 --> 37:21.861
It's useless!

37:23.492 --> 37:25.198
Two Alecs!
Two protectors!

37:25.285 --> 37:26.741
One dead!

37:26.829 --> 37:28.865
And him!
(EXPLODING)

37:38.340 --> 37:39.750
Now you
tell me something.

37:43.679 --> 37:45.135
Whose future is this?

37:50.352 --> 37:51.307
You.

37:51.395 --> 37:53.010
Start talking.

37:53.689 --> 37:54.678
About what?

37:54.773 --> 37:57.185
About the future we made
and what happens after.

37:58.610 --> 37:59.941
Corporations
versus governments.

38:00.028 --> 38:01.814
How do you think
that turns out?

38:01.905 --> 38:04.942
People chose sides,
then switched sides.

38:05.033 --> 38:06.159
Tried to protect
their families,

38:06.243 --> 38:07.608
only got caught up
in the middle.

38:07.703 --> 38:08.863
Life became
about survival,

38:08.954 --> 38:10.785
and survival became
a life sentence.

38:10.873 --> 38:13.159
Please, they're just
trying to play us.

38:14.376 --> 38:15.411
Keep talking.

38:15.711 --> 38:17.326
I grew up in this
beautiful city.

38:17.421 --> 38:19.628
In less than 30 years,
it's a lifeless crater.

38:19.715 --> 38:22.127
Dogs tearing at corpses,
everything gone to hell.

38:22.217 --> 38:23.878
Because of you.
All of you.

38:24.428 --> 38:26.134
Your useless rhetoric,
your vision.

38:26.555 --> 38:29.046
None of us is
in control here.

38:29.850 --> 38:31.841
You never catch
the Road Runner.

38:31.935 --> 38:33.015
It can't be done.

38:33.103 --> 38:34.968
KIERA:
From the moment Alec and I
traveled to this timeline,

38:35.063 --> 38:38.055
you have all been pawns
in someone else's game.

38:38.150 --> 38:39.230
CURTIS: It gets better!

38:41.820 --> 38:43.276
Chen.
It can't be.

38:43.363 --> 38:44.694
It is.

38:44.781 --> 38:46.521
KELLOG: Aw!
Well, look at this.

38:46.783 --> 38:48.648
We got the band
back together again.

38:48.744 --> 38:49.984
Sorry we're
late to the party.

38:50.078 --> 38:51.238
Your cell phone.

38:51.330 --> 38:52.365
You used it to track me.

38:52.456 --> 38:53.787
KELLOG: Well,
at least he's smart.

38:54.249 --> 38:56.501
That's something.
So come on, catch me up.

38:56.585 --> 38:59.418
I want to hear all about
this alternate future
you're apparently from.

38:59.505 --> 39:01.666
Starting with, um...

39:01.757 --> 39:02.746
Me.

39:02.841 --> 39:05.253
There's no
Corporate Congress.
We won.

39:05.344 --> 39:06.675
That's not what
the man described.

39:06.762 --> 39:10.346
I remember how it feels,
thinking you're
leading change,

39:10.432 --> 39:13.799
then realizing someone's
playing a deeper game
than you can even imagine.

39:13.894 --> 39:15.100
Like you, Lazarus?

39:16.063 --> 39:17.098
It's not a game.

39:17.606 --> 39:18.766
It's a mission.

39:20.359 --> 39:21.895
The one he sent me
back for.

39:22.444 --> 39:24.059
Kellog is one of
several clan leaders,

39:24.154 --> 39:25.485
created this plan
to change history.

39:26.907 --> 39:28.113
SONYA: Kellog?

39:29.117 --> 39:30.197
INGRAM: You see?

39:30.702 --> 39:32.533
Any future is possible.

39:32.621 --> 39:34.452
You just have to
want it bad enough.

39:35.082 --> 39:36.367
CURTIS: I'm living proof.

39:36.458 --> 39:38.790
Travis, you were done
before you began, brother.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.333
Kellog, working for himself.

39:40.420 --> 39:42.081
Curtis, working
for the freelancers.

39:42.172 --> 39:44.663
And Garza,
working for Alec Sadler.

39:45.384 --> 39:47.875
Your plans were compromised
from the beginning.

39:47.970 --> 39:49.631
No one controls the future.

39:49.763 --> 39:51.845
It is an
ever-evolving organism

39:51.932 --> 39:54.799
free to change and adapt
as it sees fit.

39:55.310 --> 39:56.595
BRAD: Nothing left
to fight for.

39:56.687 --> 39:58.223
No winners.
There is no perfect system.

39:59.314 --> 40:00.850
I can show you
ifyou let me.

40:01.817 --> 40:03.182
Let him open your eyes.

40:12.452 --> 40:13.828
Show us.

40:31.680 --> 40:34.843
As we stand now,
on the precipice of war,

40:35.767 --> 40:37.883
/ am reminded of
what we have endured...

40:37.978 --> 40:39.093
Is that me?

40:39.187 --> 40:41.223
...and what we are
fighting for.

40:42.524 --> 40:45.687
Hundreds of thousands
have already
paid a terrible price,

40:45.777 --> 40:47.153
with their lives.

40:47.237 --> 40:48.477
But for what?

40:48.572 --> 40:49.937
Our children are starving.

40:50.032 --> 40:51.943
Our city is in ruins.

40:52.034 --> 40:53.649
We have had enough.

40:54.244 --> 40:56.621
We must rise up as one.

40:56.705 --> 40:59.868
We must act now,
before it’s too late.

41:00.208 --> 41:03.120
Before our strength
and our will abandons us.

41:05.505 --> 41:08.542
You can't know what impact
your moves will have now.

41:09.384 --> 41:10.635
You're done.

41:13.055 --> 41:14.545
You're all done.

41:14.765 --> 41:15.925
She's right.

41:19.394 --> 41:20.554
It's pointless.

41:22.981 --> 41:26.144
And I'm tired of being
someone else's bitch.

41:29.738 --> 41:31.569
SONYA: This is just
one possible future.

41:31.657 --> 41:33.022
We're needed now
more than ever.

41:33.116 --> 41:35.983
No, our mission concept
is flawed.

41:36.411 --> 41:38.493
A soldier knows
when the battle is lost.

41:45.462 --> 41:46.622
Think I can have that?

41:48.215 --> 41:49.455
Does it matter?

41:51.802 --> 41:54.589
Tools always backfire.

41:56.556 --> 41:58.012
Brad, you ready
to finish this?

42:02.104 --> 42:04.595
I'm not the same guy
that came through, Curtis.

42:06.108 --> 42:07.769
You're both
on your own now.

42:10.612 --> 42:12.352
CURTIS: I'll tell you
what I do know.

42:12.447 --> 42:14.278
Whatever is supposed
to happen will,

42:14.783 --> 42:16.648
with or without you.

42:24.292 --> 42:25.702
We'll pick this up later.

42:25.961 --> 42:27.576
We can fix this.

42:27.671 --> 42:29.787
We can still fight for
what we believe in.

42:30.257 --> 42:31.997
I don't know what
that is anymore.
