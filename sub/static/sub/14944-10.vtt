I can help you with that.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.901
When's this Agent Cameron
coming in?

13:49.037 --> 13:50.413
She said 20 minutes
when I talked to her.

13:50.580 --> 13:51.956
Yeah, I know,
35 minutes ago.

13:52.249 --> 13:53.238
Yeah.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.783
It's nice of the boys
at Section 6 to let her

13:55.877 --> 13:56.912
come down and
work here full time.

13:57.045 --> 13:58.546
It's not their
usual protocol.

13:58.755 --> 14:00.131
Yeah. I wouldn't know.

14:00.257 --> 14:02.464
And I'd also
like to know why Section 6
isn't filing any reports

14:02.592 --> 14:04.548
about this task force
with my office.

14:05.095 --> 14:06.631
Well, you'll have to ask her
that when she gets here.

14:07.097 --> 14:08.587
I will.
When she gets here.

14:09.725 --> 14:11.556
Excuse me.
Yeah, sure.

14:24.823 --> 14:27.109
It's Gardiner here.
I want you to run a check on

14:27.242 --> 14:31.952
an outfit called Section 6.
Yeah, I've never
heard of them either.

14:33.874 --> 14:35.990
It's the memorial.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.454
That's exactly
what I've been
trying to tell you.

14:39.296 --> 14:41.958
Today is the day
the sculpture
becomes a memorial.

14:42.299 --> 14:44.210
(IMITATES EXPLOSION)

14:46.678 --> 14:49.636
That's right,
the building comes down.

14:50.140 --> 14:52.347
Glass and steel
raining down.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.054
It was the first
attack on the city,

14:55.145 --> 14:57.056
thousands of people
were killed.

14:58.482 --> 15:00.143
ltwas 2012.

15:00.317 --> 15:02.228
Thousands of people
were killed.

15:02.319 --> 15:04.981
And it is 2012.
And today is the day.

15:05.072 --> 15:06.107
It is today.

15:06.198 --> 15:08.154
All the more reason
why we need to fire up
the machine

15:08.241 --> 15:09.822
and get the hell
outta here.

15:16.416 --> 15:19.499
Oh, no.
Don't do this.

15:20.170 --> 15:21.706
We met for a reason.

15:23.924 --> 15:24.959
We have to go.

15:25.050 --> 15:27.541
We need to get home
before Theseus
unleashes hell.

15:29.846 --> 15:31.586
If we wait until
after it happens,

15:31.681 --> 15:33.421
who knows what
the repercussions will be.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.257
The power could get cut.

15:35.352 --> 15:37.843
The authorities could come
and shut this place down.

15:39.773 --> 15:43.186
Nothing will be
the same here
in a few hours.

15:44.611 --> 15:45.976
I know.

15:47.489 --> 15:50.947
And Iwant
to get home, Jason.
More than anything.

15:53.411 --> 15:56.073
But I can't let
thousands of people die,

15:56.164 --> 15:57.825
even if there's
a small chance

15:57.916 --> 15:59.781
I might be able to
change what's happening.

16:01.086 --> 16:02.246
You were right.

16:04.047 --> 16:05.878
We have to warn them.

16:09.136 --> 16:10.672
KAGAME: l’m truly
sorry about your father.

16:12.139 --> 16:14.221
He was a good man

16:14.307 --> 16:16.969
who understood
the danger we face
from corporations.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.509
They shot him
in cold blood.

16:21.398 --> 16:23.354
Took his life
like itwas nothing.

16:25.277 --> 16:29.190
And they will take
all of our lives
and our freedoms

16:31.575 --> 16:33.031
unless we stop them.

16:35.912 --> 16:41.498
I want to stop them.
I'm willing to do
whatever it takes.

16:43.253 --> 16:46.871
Sometimes
we must inspire others
with a personal sacrifice.

16:48.091 --> 16:51.709
A statement that
moves a generation
of followers.

16:55.974 --> 16:57.805
You understand?

16:59.603 --> 17:02.470
Itwould have
to be a statement
that changed everything.

17:05.233 --> 17:08.566
I promise you,
itwill be.

17:29.925 --> 17:31.040
What's he doing here?

17:31.134 --> 17:32.249
What am I doing here?
You kidding me?

17:32.385 --> 17:33.545
You know him?

17:33.678 --> 17:34.884
He's my stepbrother, Alec.

17:37.140 --> 17:38.129
What the hell
are you doing here?

17:38.266 --> 17:39.301
I was looking
foryou,JuHan.

17:39.392 --> 17:40.552
I thought you were
in trouble.

17:40.644 --> 17:42.930
Any trouble
that I've found
is of your doing.

17:43.605 --> 17:46.563
My father would still
be alive ifyou hadn't
helped those cops.

17:47.776 --> 17:48.982
He knows us.

17:49.152 --> 17:50.392
Yes, he does.

17:52.530 --> 17:53.565
How do you know us, Alec?

17:54.741 --> 17:56.242
From the news.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.569
That must be it.

17:57.661 --> 17:58.741
We should make sure...

17:58.828 --> 18:00.364
We will.
You have to
take care of this.

18:00.455 --> 18:03.071
In my own way.

18:04.584 --> 18:05.619
Take him.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.379
Julian!
Come on!

18:09.422 --> 18:10.411
Julian!

18:10.548 --> 18:11.583
Come on!

18:12.175 --> 18:13.790
TRAVIS:
We're going to be late.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.511
Oh, is that too tight?

18:27.274 --> 18:28.559
Do you think I'm pretty?

18:31.820 --> 18:33.276
What?

18:35.240 --> 18:37.276
We will write history
together, brother.

18:38.326 --> 18:41.318
And millions will
respect your name.

19:02.058 --> 19:04.140
It's not safe.
I want you to stay here.

19:04.352 --> 19:06.968
And miss the chance
to change history?
No way.

19:07.147 --> 19:09.354
Maybe that's why we
were sent back here.

19:09.733 --> 19:11.269
We weren't sent back.

19:11.359 --> 19:12.394
Really?

19:12.902 --> 19:16.815
It was
an insidejob, you know?
The execution.

19:17.198 --> 19:19.985
The device.
The explosion.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.067
The guards,
the warden.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.699
Who knows
how high it went.

19:27.250 --> 19:28.330
Come on, let's go.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.272
Amazing.

19:55.153 --> 19:56.768
Not from
where I'm sitting.

19:57.238 --> 20:00.071
You spoke of
this moment once.

20:00.575 --> 20:04.159
Yet that
conversation won't take
place for 60 years.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.281
Was I tied
to a chair then?

20:06.373 --> 20:07.408
No.

20:07.832 --> 20:08.912
I was.

20:10.794 --> 20:14.286
You imagined someone
could get a message to
their younger self.

20:14.589 --> 20:16.796
Offer them the kind
of wisdom and knowledge

20:16.883 --> 20:19.090
that might affect
the course of their life

20:19.302 --> 20:22.465
and, in turn,
affect the
course of history.

20:23.932 --> 20:24.967
That's great.

20:26.476 --> 20:28.216
Did the future me
happen to mention that

20:28.311 --> 20:29.972
all this business
took place in my past

20:30.105 --> 20:31.641
or are we breaking
new ground right now?

20:37.195 --> 20:39.106
Well, that's no help.

20:39.614 --> 20:40.979
Knowing for sure
that I'm going to

20:41.074 --> 20:42.439
survive long enough
to make that meeting

20:42.534 --> 20:45.025
would certainly change how
I handle this situation.

20:45.328 --> 20:49.321
You really
don't understand how
important you are, do you?

20:49.666 --> 20:51.497
No, I understand
more than you realize.

20:52.419 --> 20:55.661
What I don't understand
is how you and your gang
could possibly think

20:55.755 --> 20:57.837
you could change
the inevitable.

20:59.926 --> 21:05.512
A pebble tossed from a beach
can become a tsunami

21:05.598 --> 21:07.850
on the other side
of the world.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.683
You are that pebble.

21:11.729 --> 21:16.098
And I am standing on a beach
on the other side of time.

21:16.860 --> 21:20.603
Waiting for
the tidal wave to crash.

21:22.532 --> 21:26.366
Yeah,
you're standing on a beach
and you're facing a tsunami,

21:26.578 --> 21:29.240
but you only have
a bucket to change it.

21:30.373 --> 21:33.365
And, yeah, you could
scoop out a small amount
of water from that wave

21:33.543 --> 21:35.374
and change
history slightly.

21:36.463 --> 21:39.079
But that's it.
The wave still hits.

21:39.215 --> 21:41.046
And itwill
probably drown you.

21:42.093 --> 21:46.302
And if I'm the pebble,
then progress and
innovation is the wave.

21:47.307 --> 21:50.595
Itwill make
the world a better place.
And that you can't change.

21:55.773 --> 21:59.391
But that's precisely
my point, Alec.

22:01.154 --> 22:04.772
You're the one who
convinced me I can.

22:11.915 --> 22:14.247
All right,
which one of these buildings
is the target?

22:17.879 --> 22:19.585
I was kind hoping
you'd remember.

22:19.756 --> 22:21.496
This is history to me.

22:21.591 --> 22:22.797
I don't remember specifics.

22:22.884 --> 22:24.340
You're the one
who's been doing
the research.

22:24.427 --> 22:26.338
Okay, okay.
Sojust think!

22:31.184 --> 22:32.219
I don't remember.

22:32.310 --> 22:33.345
Then we have to
warn all of them.

22:34.896 --> 22:36.386
Okay, this one!

22:37.023 --> 22:39.730
No. Here.

22:44.656 --> 22:45.987
Yeah, that's what
I thought.

22:46.074 --> 22:47.564
Someone's gone to
a lot of trouble

22:47.659 --> 22:49.695
to put her in
a position of trust.

22:50.787 --> 22:53.199
No. Let's keep this
on a need to know.

22:53.414 --> 22:54.995
If she is working
for Liber8,

22:55.124 --> 22:57.285
I don't want to tip our hand
that we know
she's one of them.

22:57.961 --> 22:59.997
We need to evacuate
the premises immediately.

23:00.255 --> 23:01.370
Yeah, right.

23:01.464 --> 23:03.079
Get on the phone,
call the police.

23:03.174 --> 23:05.335
Ask for Inspector Dillon,
he will vouch for me.

23:05.635 --> 23:07.375
Now, typically
the agency's...

23:07.470 --> 23:09.711
Sir, I got Kiera
on line three.

23:11.266 --> 23:13.006
Yeah, Kiera.
Sir.

23:13.101 --> 23:15.592
I'm at City Plaza.
I believe that Liber8
is going to

23:15.687 --> 23:16.893
bring down one of
the buildings with a bomb

23:16.980 --> 23:18.470
but I can't be
certain which one.

23:18.565 --> 23:21.056
I need your approval
to evacuate all of
them immediately.

23:21.234 --> 23:23.725
Inspector this
is now a matter of
national security.

23:23.820 --> 23:25.230
I'm officially
taking over.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.863
I'll take care of it, Kiera.
Stay where you are.

23:30.159 --> 23:31.695
Thank you.

23:32.036 --> 23:33.776
We need to treat this
as a real bomb threat.

23:33.871 --> 23:34.906
Yes, we do.

23:35.039 --> 23:37.075
So we send down
the bomb squad
and the ER team.

23:37.166 --> 23:38.747
You're coming with me.
We're going to
go to the Plaza

23:38.835 --> 23:39.915
and find your partner.

23:40.003 --> 23:42.085
Come on.
Everyone, let's go.

23:50.597 --> 23:51.677
Where have you been?

23:51.764 --> 23:52.799
On an errand.

23:54.017 --> 23:56.349
What kind of errand?

23:56.436 --> 23:58.176
I had some
business to do
for Kagame!

23:58.354 --> 23:59.434
It's nothing.

24:06.613 --> 24:08.023
Why are you so upset?

24:08.197 --> 24:09.607
Something's going on.

24:10.199 --> 24:12.155
Something you're
not telling me.

24:15.371 --> 24:17.202
What are you not
telling me, Sonya?

24:17.498 --> 24:18.874
You know what
you need to know.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.536
And when Kagame wants
you to know more,
he'll tell you.

24:20.668 --> 24:21.874
To hell with Kagame!

24:22.003 --> 24:24.335
Kagame is our leader.
Not you.

24:26.299 --> 24:29.962
He was then.
But now he's strayed
from the very plan

24:30.053 --> 24:31.042
he laid out in 2077.

24:31.387 --> 24:32.502
He's lied to us!

24:32.597 --> 24:33.677
SONYA: No, he hasn't.

24:33.848 --> 24:36.009
TRAVIS: He said we
would go back six years.
It's been 65.

24:37.268 --> 24:39.259
I get the feeling that
was the plan all along.

24:41.272 --> 24:43.388
What is your design?

24:43.483 --> 24:45.895
You are a very
important member
of this cell.

24:46.277 --> 24:47.858
Kagame has his reasons.

24:49.364 --> 24:51.229
We have to trust them.

25:25.483 --> 25:27.565
Carlos. Good.
I need your help organizing
the second building.

25:27.777 --> 25:29.392
Don't worry about that,
Agent Cameron.

25:29.487 --> 25:30.727
We've got it under control.
Thank you.

25:30.822 --> 25:33.029
Kiera, this is
Agent Gardiner from CSIS.

25:33.449 --> 25:34.484
I've been wanting
to meet you.

25:35.535 --> 25:37.776
I'm very interested
in hearing how you obtained
this information.

25:38.287 --> 25:40.869
I will tell you
all of that later
but right now...

25:40.957 --> 25:44.199
I think right now would be
an appropriate time,
Agent Cameron.

25:44.669 --> 25:46.455
I have informants, sir.

25:46.546 --> 25:48.207
With Section 6?
Yes.

25:48.297 --> 25:50.128
Hey. I told her.

25:51.217 --> 25:54.630
Well, I helped her remember.
She and I,
we're from the future.

25:54.721 --> 25:55.801
No.

25:57.807 --> 26:00.139
Hey. Hey! Ithink we
have a problem here.

26:01.227 --> 26:03.058
An unauthorized vehicle
justpuHedin.

26:03.312 --> 26:04.848
This guy one of yours?

26:09.861 --> 26:11.146
CARLOS:
That's Julian Randol.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.693
Get everyone out of here.
Everybody out!

26:45.772 --> 26:46.807
Theseus.

26:59.702 --> 27:01.693
Put your hands in the air
and step out of the vehicle!

27:04.499 --> 27:06.285
Put the switch down, son!

27:09.420 --> 27:10.535
Rot in hell.

27:11.589 --> 27:12.795
Take him!

27:12.882 --> 27:14.088
Come on!

27:15.843 --> 27:17.674
No! Get the hell
off of me!

27:18.179 --> 27:20.261
No! Off of me.

27:20.348 --> 27:21.383
Get him out of here now!

27:24.101 --> 27:25.841
Go to hell!
Move it.

27:26.020 --> 27:27.635
Run. Everybody go!

27:29.232 --> 27:31.188
OFFICER: Right this way!
Move.

27:31.818 --> 27:34.400
Detonator wasn't connected.
Explosives neutralized.

27:34.821 --> 27:38.109
Copy. Looks like
the situation's
under control.

27:39.242 --> 27:41.574
I believe you were gonna
answer some questions
for me, Agent Cameron.

27:43.037 --> 27:44.902
I'm still
interested in knowing
who those contacts are.

27:47.041 --> 27:48.076
(MOBILE PHONE RINGS)

27:49.377 --> 27:51.163
Looks like cell service
has been restored.

27:51.254 --> 27:52.960
Gardiner here.
Yes, sir.

28:04.559 --> 28:06.515
Understood, sir.
Thank you.

28:10.106 --> 28:12.973
Ijust received a call
from my supervisor,
Agent Cameron.

28:13.109 --> 28:16.067
Letting me know that
he's been in contact with
your commander, Mr. Esher,

28:17.029 --> 28:21.443
and that I am to
cooperate fully from here
on with Section 6.

28:23.452 --> 28:24.441
Excuse me.

28:25.580 --> 28:28.447
I've never seen CSIS
back down to anyone
like that before.

28:29.792 --> 28:32.283
I'd like to meet your boss
and shake his hand.

28:35.047 --> 28:36.628
So would I.

28:46.392 --> 28:50.556
Hey, it's not broken!
You changed history.

28:50.980 --> 28:53.187
She changed history
over here!

28:54.442 --> 28:56.307
All right, blue eyes,
we've got a time machine
waiting for us.

28:56.444 --> 28:57.980
Let's go, let's go!

29:00.990 --> 29:03.026
Tell you what,
I'll meet you there.

29:03.492 --> 29:05.778
Okay.
But time's a-wasting.

29:06.162 --> 29:08.027
Don't take too long.
I won't.

29:14.921 --> 29:17.583
Let me guess,
it's complicated.

29:20.051 --> 29:21.086
Yeah.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.896
Something happened
to the bomb.

29:39.987 --> 29:41.227
I tried the detonator,
it wouldn't go off.

29:41.364 --> 29:42.604
Someone sabotaged it.

29:42.698 --> 29:44.279
It wasn't supposed to work.

29:44.367 --> 29:45.402
What?

29:45.868 --> 29:48.575
Listen to me.
This battle isn't over.

29:48.704 --> 29:52.288
It's hardly begun.
There are many ways
to sacrifice.

29:52.583 --> 29:56.201
None more noble
than the other.
We will meet again.

29:58.631 --> 30:00.087
Kagame!

30:02.885 --> 30:06.719
Kiera! It's Building Two.

30:06.806 --> 30:08.137
I saw a map.
They're going to
blow Building Two.

30:08.224 --> 30:10.636
No, Alec, listen.
It's okay.
We got Julian.

30:10.726 --> 30:12.591
He was in Building One.
You don't understand.

30:12.728 --> 30:14.138
I was at their hideout.
I saw their plan.

30:14.230 --> 30:15.845
Julian was
just a diversion.

30:20.861 --> 30:21.896
Kagame.

30:24.699 --> 30:25.984
Alec, stay here.

30:35.918 --> 30:36.953
Kagame.

30:39.630 --> 30:43.839
Ifyou shoot me,
you risk
losing everything.

30:45.553 --> 30:46.668
Where's the bomb?

30:53.644 --> 30:55.350
Do not do this.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.603
Have you forgotten
your history lessons?

30:59.984 --> 31:01.474
It's already done.

31:03.696 --> 31:06.813
No, this doesn't
have to happen.

31:07.575 --> 31:09.440
We can change history.

31:09.785 --> 31:13.118
But that's my role to
play in the larger plan.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.450
Whose plan?

31:16.625 --> 31:17.660
His.

31:21.047 --> 31:22.503
What?
What are you
talking about?

31:23.507 --> 31:24.713
Explain yourself.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.506
That would take
too much time.

31:26.719 --> 31:29.836
I'm on a schedule,
and this bomb is
set to go off,

31:29.930 --> 31:31.670
and none of us
can stop it.

31:32.516 --> 31:34.472
Alec will explain.

31:36.937 --> 31:38.723
What's he talking about?
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

31:42.401 --> 31:46.019
Kiera, he's going
to do it, trust me,
we gotta go. Come on!

31:46.530 --> 31:49.317
We have a possible sighting
of Eduoard Kagame
entering Building Two.

31:49.408 --> 31:51.114
Are you sure?
Prepare to evacuate.

31:52.661 --> 31:53.912
Kiera was just...

32:43.462 --> 32:44.497
(COUGHING)

33:49.862 --> 33:50.942
Go.

34:27.650 --> 34:29.561
I know you.

34:29.652 --> 34:30.687
Mrs. Kagame.

34:30.986 --> 34:32.317
Yes?

34:37.826 --> 34:41.410
A friend of mine asked
me to give this to you.

34:48.712 --> 34:51.499
I can't answer your questions,
you'll just have to trust me.

35:00.557 --> 35:01.592
Thank you.

35:15.114 --> 35:17.571
Sonya.

35:17.658 --> 35:18.738
You followed me?

35:19.868 --> 35:21.529
Where's Kagame?

35:23.664 --> 35:25.575
Come with me.

35:29.503 --> 35:31.414
What are you doing here?

35:32.464 --> 35:35.126
Kagame was in the building
when it exploded.

35:36.844 --> 35:40.007
What are you talking about?
I thought Julian was.

35:40.097 --> 35:43.715
No. Kagame had this
planned all along.

35:45.144 --> 35:46.509
Today's his birthday.

35:48.355 --> 35:49.390
He's here?

35:50.774 --> 35:53.607
Down the hall.
Just born.

35:55.946 --> 35:57.686
He told me
some other things.

35:58.782 --> 36:01.239
He asked me to
make arrangements
for his mother.

36:02.369 --> 36:04.325
Make arrangements for him.

36:04.663 --> 36:06.995
What are you
talking about?

36:08.208 --> 36:10.870
He said we would meet again
and it would all make sense.

36:13.756 --> 36:16.293
He also told me that
after he died today,

36:17.718 --> 36:21.336
he wanted me
to do something
very important.

36:23.349 --> 36:25.431
He wanted me
to succeed him.

36:28.437 --> 36:29.472
(LOUD BANG)

36:35.152 --> 36:36.688
Jason?

36:39.031 --> 36:41.113
What took you so long?

36:43.285 --> 36:45.947
Well, it blew anyway.
The building.

36:46.705 --> 36:49.162
We didn't change history.

36:49.249 --> 36:50.375
Not yet.

36:52.002 --> 36:54.084
Which means
all those horrible things
are going to happen anyways

36:54.171 --> 36:55.752
and there's
nothing we can do.

36:57.841 --> 36:59.923
Show me the time machine.

37:00.094 --> 37:02.176
Let me get the lights.

37:10.896 --> 37:11.931
Huh?

37:12.272 --> 37:13.307
(LAUGHS)

37:18.654 --> 37:20.019
(HUMMING)

37:28.122 --> 37:29.908
It's a beauty, isn't it?

37:31.208 --> 37:32.493
Yeah.

37:55.149 --> 37:57.982
We'll be wearing these.
I'll fit one for you.

38:01.864 --> 38:04.606
When we hold here,
a massive pulse,

38:04.700 --> 38:07.442
down through here,
up to the ball.

38:24.178 --> 38:26.214
Seems I can't
get rid of you.

38:27.347 --> 38:29.053
Did you have
anything to do
with this?

38:31.143 --> 38:35.182
No. Not in this year.
Not in 2076.

38:36.231 --> 38:38.062
I told you,
I was just a pawn.

38:41.570 --> 38:45.062
My cover was
almost blown today.

38:51.163 --> 38:52.369
That leaves you.

38:53.665 --> 38:54.700
It wasn't me.

38:56.084 --> 38:58.166
Must have been
your guardian angel.

39:00.756 --> 39:01.836
A Freelancer?

39:04.092 --> 39:05.172
A Who?

39:07.054 --> 39:08.760
Never mind.

39:10.933 --> 39:13.049
I guess I can't
change history after all.

39:21.276 --> 39:23.392
ngetus
out of here.

40:00.274 --> 40:02.356
You're alive?
Of course.

40:03.819 --> 40:06.561
I knew what was going
to happen to the Congress.

40:08.574 --> 40:11.441
That's impossible.
How could you have known?

40:11.618 --> 40:16.612
How I knew and how I came
to be the man I am today,

40:18.292 --> 40:20.374
is going to
become clear to you.

40:26.675 --> 40:28.506
What's that?

40:28.885 --> 40:31.467
The culmination
of my life's work.

40:33.390 --> 40:36.803
You and I have
a lot more in common
than you realize, Edouard.

40:37.978 --> 40:39.388
I don't understand.

40:39.479 --> 40:40.514
You will.

40:42.858 --> 40:44.974
You will.

40:46.862 --> 40:52.027
Have you ever
stood on a beach and faced
an approaching tsunami?

41:37.663 --> 41:39.745
You have taught me
everything I know.

41:42.209 --> 41:46.748
Theseus, tell me,
can I trust him?

41:47.673 --> 41:49.755
My brother?

41:51.176 --> 41:53.258
Who knows?

41:55.430 --> 41:56.419
Who knows.

41:59.017 --> 42:01.929
But you will do
as he proposes,

42:03.939 --> 42:07.272
and I will do my best
to prepare you.

42:20.747 --> 42:22.658
You there?

42:22.749 --> 42:23.784
Yeah, I'm here.

42:27.629 --> 42:29.130
I don't know
how to say this.

42:31.800 --> 42:33.916
Just say it, Alec.

42:37.639 --> 42:40.881
Yourjourney here
was no accident.

42:44.146 --> 42:46.307
The time travel device
didn ’t malfunction,

42:46.732 --> 42:48.814
and Kagame knew this.

42:52.154 --> 42:57.194
The truth is,
I'm the one who
sent you back in time.

43:00.829 --> 43:02.945
And you’re not
going to believe why.
