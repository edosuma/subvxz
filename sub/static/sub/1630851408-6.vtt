00:47.422 --> 00:48.924
Professor Luxcraft?

00:51.093 --> 00:52.636
Professor Luxcraft!

00:54.721 --> 00:56.473
Professor Luxcraft!

01:03.939 --> 01:04.982
Hey, Wolfy.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.777
Did you find him? What did he say?

01:08.861 --> 01:10.654
He's still not there.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.531
It's been days now.

01:12.614 --> 01:14.700
It's like he's just vanished.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.493
Where do you think he's gone?

01:16.577 --> 01:17.619
I don't know.

01:18.996 --> 01:21.290
I'm never gonna get any answers.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.043
What happened to your mask?

01:25.669 --> 01:27.963
I think it happened in the Memory Maze.

01:29.214 --> 01:33.802
Then maybe you can make a new one.You love making things.

01:33.886 --> 01:36.305
No. This one's special.

01:37.431 --> 01:38.724
Mum made it for me.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.357
Maybe she can fix it for you.

01:48.775 --> 01:49.776
She could.

01:49.860 --> 01:52.779
-I could go and see her.-Hooray!

01:52.863 --> 01:54.364
Hey, what's up?

01:54.948 --> 01:57.201
We're all going on an adventure!

01:57.784 --> 01:59.494
To visit Wolfy's mum!

02:01.038 --> 02:02.706
That's a great idea.

02:02.789 --> 02:06.293
You could ask her if she remembersLuxcraft from when you were a baby.

02:06.376 --> 02:07.419
Oh, yeah.

02:08.002 --> 02:11.507
And maybe she knows somethingabout this prophecy he was talking about.

02:11.590 --> 02:15.344
I can't find anythingabout a human with spryte powers.

02:15.427 --> 02:16.553
Ready!

02:17.054 --> 02:18.722
We're going on an adventure.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.017
But are you sure you guys want to come?

02:22.100 --> 02:24.186
It's not as fun as down here.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.104
My house is kinda boring.

02:26.188 --> 02:28.565
Adventures are never boring!

02:28.649 --> 02:31.777
And besides,it'll be cool to see where you're from.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.321
There must be some explanation.

02:43.830 --> 02:44.998
What's that?

02:45.082 --> 02:47.626
We call that a "car."

02:48.460 --> 02:50.546
Please tell me we're almost there.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.756
Yep. It's just up here.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.512
Wow.

02:58.595 --> 03:01.181
Okay. I'm gonna seewhat I can find out from Mum.

03:01.265 --> 03:02.975
And we'll search for clues.

03:03.058 --> 03:07.062
Yeah! Where do you think your mumkeeps the clues?

03:07.145 --> 03:09.565
There may be some old stuff in the attic.

03:09.648 --> 03:11.900
In the attic?

03:15.612 --> 03:19.199
Wait, Mum thinks I've beenat boarding school all this time.

03:19.283 --> 03:21.493
I can't tell her where I've really been.

03:21.577 --> 03:23.996
Maybe you two should hang back.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.747
If she saw you--

03:26.748 --> 03:29.418
Darling, what a wonderful surprise.

03:30.085 --> 03:31.211
Hi, Mum.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.132
Let me explain.

03:36.175 --> 03:39.344
Look at you. All grown up.

03:40.679 --> 03:43.849
Humans can't see sprytes, you big silly.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.352
I missed you, you know.

03:47.436 --> 03:48.854
Me too, Mum.

03:53.734 --> 03:54.985
Custard!

04:01.325 --> 04:03.202
What's gotten into Custard?

04:03.285 --> 04:04.536
No idea.

04:05.287 --> 04:06.288
Meep!

04:08.332 --> 04:11.251
I received a very strange letterfrom your headmaster.

04:12.461 --> 04:14.463
Very strange indeed.

04:15.964 --> 04:20.052
"I'm writing to confirmthat your human child is doing well

04:20.135 --> 04:25.140
and is doing all sorts of human thingshere at his human school."

04:25.933 --> 04:28.352
Signed, Professor L.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.146
How does he know where I live?

04:32.064 --> 04:34.399
What does he mean by "human" things?

04:34.483 --> 04:38.028
Just English, Latin, maths.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.113
You know, human things.

04:40.197 --> 04:43.825
But it seems like you're enjoying it?

04:43.909 --> 04:45.452
I got your letters too.

04:45.536 --> 04:47.454
It's amazing.

04:47.538 --> 04:51.083
I'm learning so much,and I've made the best friends.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.752
That's fantastic.

04:53.836 --> 04:56.171
You've got to bring them by sometime.

04:56.255 --> 04:59.341
Yeah. I'll bring them by sometime.

05:09.935 --> 05:12.980
So, how have you been, Mum?

05:16.108 --> 05:17.526
Silly puppy.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.779
Sprout, look at this place.

05:23.282 --> 05:28.370
Now, Wolfy saidthere might be some clues in the attic.

05:29.496 --> 05:32.291
What do you suppose an attic is?

05:41.049 --> 05:42.426
You okay, darling?

06:06.366 --> 06:08.869
Something's gotten into Custard.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.787
Yeah. Yeah.

06:11.371 --> 06:14.374
Hey, Mum, I cracked my mask.

06:14.458 --> 06:18.170
-Think you could fix it for me?-Oh, no. How did you do that?

06:18.253 --> 06:21.173
I got into a bit of trouble in the

06:22.257 --> 06:24.051
library.

06:24.635 --> 06:27.679
-Are kids picking on you again?-No, no. No.

06:27.763 --> 06:31.683
-You know you can tell me if they are.-No, it's not that. I promise.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.227
It was just an accident.

06:34.686 --> 06:38.482
It's just a little crack.I bet you could have fixed it yourself.

06:41.944 --> 06:44.154
Of course I can fix it.

06:47.991 --> 06:50.494
Hey, Mum, I wanted to ask you.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.996
What was I like when I was younger?

06:53.747 --> 06:55.832
You were just as special as you are now.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.669
Always so creative and imaginative.

07:00.754 --> 07:04.383
Why did we move around so muchwhen I was little?

07:04.466 --> 07:08.095
Well, I suppose it took us a whileto find our place.

07:09.304 --> 07:10.722
Why do you ask?

07:13.725 --> 07:17.062
Come on.Tell me what it is and I can help.

07:18.105 --> 07:21.817
Mum, did you ever knowany colorful men with long beards?

07:22.985 --> 07:25.028
Of course. I work in the theater.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.245
Meep!

07:35.831 --> 07:37.666
What do you think this does?

07:41.670 --> 07:45.048
The clues are in the attic.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.263
Bouncelings!

07:55.184 --> 07:58.562
They're all tired now. Poor little guys.

08:02.399 --> 08:05.694
Did you always knowthat you wanted to make costumes?

08:05.777 --> 08:07.362
No, not always.

08:07.946 --> 08:12.075
See, sometimes it takes timeto figure out who you're supposed to be.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.953
But how do you know?

08:16.663 --> 08:18.165
Is everything okay?

08:19.208 --> 08:21.543
I'm just trying to figure some stuff out.

08:24.588 --> 08:26.548
Well, I know who you are.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.218
I've always known.

08:29.885 --> 08:31.970
You're William Wolfe.

08:32.054 --> 08:34.139
What more do you need to know?

08:43.524 --> 08:45.984
Fly, my pretties, fly!

09:02.000 --> 09:04.461
Hey, there's the attic!

09:05.212 --> 09:06.964
The clues must be in there.

09:10.425 --> 09:11.802
So sparkly!

09:12.511 --> 09:14.680
Oneira would love these.

09:16.557 --> 09:18.392
Now surely this

09:19.434 --> 09:21.144
is a clue.

09:22.312 --> 09:23.939
Don't you think, Xandra?

09:25.274 --> 09:26.650
Xandra?

09:27.985 --> 09:30.863
She has a mask just like Wolfboy's.

09:32.114 --> 09:33.907
I think this might be a clue.

09:35.367 --> 09:36.952
So we have two clues.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.330
Custard.

09:41.874 --> 09:43.417
What is going on?

10:06.857 --> 10:10.068
I'd forgotten all about that song.

10:10.152 --> 10:12.571
You used to play it for me all the time.

10:47.189 --> 10:50.901
-She wants that squeaky thing.-She can't have the clue!

10:50.984 --> 10:52.694
Stop squeaking the clue!

10:52.778 --> 10:54.196
What are we gonna do?

11:26.770 --> 11:29.898
Nobody can tell you who you are,my darling.

11:29.982 --> 11:33.026
You have to figure that out for yourself.

11:33.110 --> 11:35.612
You just have to listen to your heart.

11:49.668 --> 11:52.045
You keep this close, okay?

11:52.129 --> 11:53.130
Okay, Mum.

11:53.630 --> 11:56.550
Don't worry about me. I'll figure it out.

12:06.059 --> 12:09.229
So, did your mom know anythingabout Luxcraft?

12:09.313 --> 12:12.482
No, but it was nice to see her.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.943
Well, we found a clue!

12:17.529 --> 12:21.408
Wow! I've never seen my mum so young.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.785
I wonder when this was taken.

12:25.329 --> 12:26.830
Thanks, Xandra.

13:03.909 --> 13:06.954
Hey, Blip, you're up early.What are you doing?

13:07.913 --> 13:08.914
Blip?

13:08.997 --> 13:12.376
Don't worry.He's practicing his snowflakes.

13:12.459 --> 13:13.544
Is he okay?

13:13.627 --> 13:16.463
He looks a little tense.

13:16.547 --> 13:19.258
Yeah,he always gets like this before Snow Lab.

13:19.925 --> 13:22.678
You know, I don't wanna boop my own horn,

13:22.761 --> 13:26.056
but I'm pretty good at making snowflakes.

13:26.849 --> 13:28.141
I wanna see!

13:29.977 --> 13:33.689
-Morning.-And what a splendid morning it is!

13:33.772 --> 13:37.401
Wolfy's about to use his powersto make some snowflakes!

13:40.028 --> 13:44.408
Luxcraft seemed convinced thatI had the power to make my creations real,

13:44.491 --> 13:45.909
just like sprytes do.

13:45.993 --> 13:48.161
So all I have to do is…

13:51.290 --> 13:52.875
Snow! Pow, pow, pow.

13:59.047 --> 14:03.051
Well, they're the best snowflakesI've seen all day.

14:03.135 --> 14:08.265
In fact, they're so good,I'm gonna hang them up here. See?

14:08.348 --> 14:12.060
Thanks, Sprout,but they're not real snowflakes.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.688
Maybe Luxcraft was wrong about me.

14:16.732 --> 14:19.526
Has Blip been up all nightpracticing again?

14:20.360 --> 14:22.070
Poor thing.

14:22.154 --> 14:24.239
Does Blip not like Snow Lab?

14:24.323 --> 14:28.118
It's just some pre-lab jitters.He'll be okay.

14:28.202 --> 14:32.581
Now come on. I wanna get some breakfastbefore all the blue mash runs out.

14:43.509 --> 14:47.221
-I told you to bring a coat.-Guardian sprytes don't need coats.

14:47.304 --> 14:49.848
I don't know. You look pretty chilly.

14:49.932 --> 14:53.769
I like it.Besides, you're the one turning blue.

14:53.852 --> 14:56.021
That's just the mash.

15:00.192 --> 15:01.360
On second thought,

15:01.443 --> 15:03.987
I think I might be coming downwith something.

15:04.071 --> 15:06.323
Oh, Blip. Come on.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.951
You cannot miss Snow Lab again.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.039
What's that?

15:57.124 --> 15:59.001
That's Professor Glaçon.

16:11.096 --> 16:14.933
Salut, sprytelings. Welcome to Snow Lab.

16:15.017 --> 16:16.310
Welcome!

16:17.519 --> 16:21.023
Mademoiselle Glaçon, you're already here?

16:21.106 --> 16:22.691
Bonjour, Monsieur Snjor.

16:22.774 --> 16:26.987
I will get out of your hair,but I'll be back soon.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.867
Right. Well, let's get inside, shall we?

16:32.451 --> 16:35.204
I hope we'll all fit. Everyone, come on.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.959
It's nice and warm in here.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.628
I wouldn't get used to it.

16:42.711 --> 16:44.671
Brace yourselves, everyone.

16:55.349 --> 17:00.812
Okay, everyone.Spread out, find yourself a blank sheet.

17:00.896 --> 17:03.815
I hope you'veall been practicing your shapes.

17:04.650 --> 17:07.694
Remember, symmetry, symmetry, symmetry.

17:08.278 --> 17:10.030
And no copying.

17:10.739 --> 17:13.784
Every snowflake must be unique.

17:13.867 --> 17:17.871
You must put something of yourselfinto every one of them you make.

17:19.957 --> 17:22.751
-What are you doing?-You'll see.

17:30.801 --> 17:33.262
Now that you've finished your designs,

17:33.345 --> 17:37.266
it's time tobring your snowflakes to life.

17:37.349 --> 17:40.269
That's it. Guide the wisps into your ice.

17:40.352 --> 17:42.062
Feel the creative energy.

17:42.145 --> 17:44.106
Let it move through you.

17:54.533 --> 17:57.369
Come on, wisps, help me out here!

17:57.452 --> 17:59.454
Maybe snowflakes just aren't your thing.

18:01.373 --> 18:03.333
Come along now, Blip.

18:10.883 --> 18:12.217
Oh, my!

18:12.801 --> 18:15.053
-Precision.-Nice one, Blip.

18:15.137 --> 18:17.514
The symmetry. It's a triumph.

18:18.307 --> 18:19.850
Blip, Blip, hooray!

18:20.893 --> 18:23.770
Whoa, Blip. What were you worried about?

18:23.854 --> 18:25.731
You're the best in the class.

18:25.814 --> 18:29.109
Hey, you can relax now. It's all over.

18:29.193 --> 18:32.362
Oh, you sweet,innocent little wolf spryte.

18:32.446 --> 18:34.740
It hasn't even started.

18:34.823 --> 18:37.242
-What do you mean?-Tremendous job, class.

18:37.326 --> 18:40.287
Now, if you can takeall your snowflakelings outside

18:40.370 --> 18:42.206
to meet Professor Glaçon.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.625
It's time for the dancing.

18:45.626 --> 18:47.878
-Dancing?-Dancing.

18:50.130 --> 18:53.509
Before your snowflakelings are readyfor the surface,

18:53.592 --> 18:56.720
they must learn to dance.

18:57.221 --> 19:01.850
Now please take your partnersand follow me.

19:01.934 --> 19:05.687
Is this why you've been nervous all day?It's just dancing.

19:05.771 --> 19:08.857
It's not just dancing.It's pure humiliation.

19:09.483 --> 19:10.734
I can't dance.

19:20.911 --> 19:24.122
Will you not dance with us today,Monsieur Snjor?

19:25.123 --> 19:27.835
No, thank you, Mademoiselle Glaçon.

19:27.918 --> 19:29.461
I could never.

19:30.045 --> 19:33.131
Now, who would like to go first?

19:33.215 --> 19:35.259
We can go first.

19:45.978 --> 19:48.564
There. See, everyone?

19:48.647 --> 19:51.233
Look how she moves with the wind.

19:52.109 --> 19:55.696
Such grace, such coordination.

19:56.446 --> 19:58.073
Superb, Oneira.

19:58.657 --> 19:59.700
Who's next?

20:08.876 --> 20:09.960
Cool!

20:15.924 --> 20:17.509
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

20:34.693 --> 20:36.028
No.

20:48.457 --> 20:51.752
I'm sorry, Professor, but it's impossible.

20:51.835 --> 20:53.837
I simply cannot dance.

20:54.338 --> 20:56.173
My dear spryteling,

20:56.256 --> 21:02.179
you know very well the dance is all partof this wonderful creative process.

21:02.262 --> 21:05.390
If you don't believe you can do it,

21:05.474 --> 21:07.643
what chance do you have?

21:11.897 --> 21:15.567
Poor Blip. He really cannot dance.

21:16.151 --> 21:18.362
No one can't dance.

21:35.128 --> 21:38.173
I think I've got somethingthat might help you with your dancing.

21:38.257 --> 21:39.258
It won't work.

21:41.552 --> 21:42.845
Is that an orb?

21:44.012 --> 21:45.222
Sure is.

21:45.305 --> 21:47.891
It's a dance orb.

21:47.975 --> 21:49.476
I got it from a rhythm spryte.

21:50.102 --> 21:52.563
Whoever holds it can dance like the wind.

21:54.565 --> 21:57.067
Look, it even makes my hair dance.

22:01.613 --> 22:04.867
Inconceivable. It really works?

22:04.950 --> 22:07.494
Yep. I'm terrible at dancing,

22:07.578 --> 22:09.705
but I've been using it all day.

22:09.788 --> 22:11.623
Why don't you give it a try?

22:15.127 --> 22:18.881
Must be infused with some kind ofarcane patterned-movement energy.

22:20.841 --> 22:23.969
You know, that's exactlywhat the rhythm spryte said.

22:32.603 --> 22:35.439
Okay, dance orb. Do your thing.

22:40.485 --> 22:43.739
-Let's go, Blip!-Yay, Blip!

22:58.837 --> 23:01.089
I've never seen a dance like that.

23:01.173 --> 23:02.883
Bravo, Blip!

23:06.136 --> 23:08.138
I wanna go again!

23:14.144 --> 23:17.272
-Bravo!-Good job, Blip. You did so good!

23:20.025 --> 23:21.443
Mademoiselle,

23:21.527 --> 23:24.696
I was wonderingwhether you would like to--

23:24.780 --> 23:29.701
Professor, do you think whateveryou are about to ask me could wait?

23:29.785 --> 23:32.579
I would like very much to dance.

23:33.997 --> 23:35.290
Oh, yes.

23:45.175 --> 23:49.096
It's a good thing a rhythm sprytegave you that dance orb, Wolfy.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.473
There was no rhythm spryte.

23:51.557 --> 23:54.393
And it's not a dance orb.It's just a balloon.

23:55.978 --> 23:57.896
What's a "laboon"?

23:58.480 --> 23:59.648
It doesn't matter.

23:59.731 --> 24:03.318
He just had to believe he could do it,and then he could.

24:10.993 --> 24:12.870
Isn't it nice, Floof?

24:13.370 --> 24:14.997
It's like it's snowing.
