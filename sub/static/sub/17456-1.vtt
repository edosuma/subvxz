WEBVTT

03:17.209 --> 03:18.751
Let's go, guys...

03:24.209 --> 03:25.584
Come over here.

03:28.751 --> 03:30.209
Good fish, right?

03:30.542 --> 03:31.876
Thanks!

03:34.584 --> 03:36.126
OK, it's all of us?

03:36.292 --> 03:37.584
All of us together?

03:37.709 --> 03:39.084
All together.

03:46.751 --> 03:48.042
My hand went numb.

04:04.376 --> 04:06.667
I'm all wet! I'm going in.

04:06.792 --> 04:09.167
Spray some over here.

04:26.667 --> 04:32.376
<i>Attention please. Tonight we'll begin
our return trip towards Athens.</i>

04:33.917 --> 04:37.917
<i>Anyone planning to dive again
today, please inform the crew.</i>

04:38.084 --> 04:39.417
<i>Thank you.</i>

04:42.459 --> 04:45.167
There must be a lot of fish
over by that cliff.

04:45.334 --> 04:48.334
Did you see the bream I missed?

04:48.417 --> 04:51.042
The second one?

04:51.209 --> 04:52.459
Huge fish.

04:52.501 --> 04:54.084
- Really?
- I had it like that.

04:55.251 --> 04:57.001
...and? It disappeared.

04:57.376 --> 04:58.042
Dimitris...

04:58.167 --> 05:00.334
I think you need to start diving too.

05:00.709 --> 05:02.209
I'm a little scared.

05:04.417 --> 05:06.417
There are beautiful rocks down there,

05:06.501 --> 05:08.126
perfect for your collection.

05:08.209 --> 05:09.917
Like that. Dead on.

05:11.209 --> 05:12.667
It looked at me.

05:12.751 --> 05:13.876
It turned, to run..

05:14.209 --> 05:16.251
You, you don't get scared?

05:16.417 --> 05:17.542
At first I was.

05:17.709 --> 05:18.876
What's in this?

05:19.001 --> 05:20.334
Cream cheese.

05:20.584 --> 05:22.334
Lettuce, tomato, and cheese?

05:22.709 --> 05:24.917
You, Yorgos? How deep do you go?

05:25.167 --> 05:26.876
Fifteen meters on a good day.

05:28.501 --> 05:29.917
- Christos too.
- With tanks?

05:30.001 --> 05:31.084
Tanks? No.

05:31.501 --> 05:35.542
- Yannis, what did you catch?
- A couple of breams.

05:35.959 --> 05:38.792
- Breams, eh? How many?
- Two or three.

05:38.876 --> 05:41.667
- Big ones?
- Not big. Medium.

05:41.792 --> 05:44.667
But it's hard to catch breams...

05:45.001 --> 05:46.084
They're fast.

05:46.542 --> 05:48.751
It takes skill to catch them.
It isn't easy.

05:48.792 --> 05:50.167
These are terrible.

05:50.584 --> 05:51.501
Anyway...

05:51.876 --> 05:53.459
I'm leaving you now.

05:53.584 --> 05:55.709
- This afternoon we'll dive again?
- You bet.

06:08.292 --> 06:09.626
Yorgos...

06:10.334 --> 06:12.251
Your glasses.

06:14.626 --> 06:16.709
Thanks.

06:18.584 --> 06:21.209
- Will you dive again later?
- Yes.

06:23.126 --> 06:24.542
Can I come with you?

06:26.251 --> 06:29.167
Another time. When the
water is safer.

06:29.876 --> 06:32.209
We'll do a dive lesson first...

06:32.292 --> 06:34.084
to check your breathing...

06:34.501 --> 06:36.042
I have very strong lungs.

06:36.334 --> 06:38.209
Much better than my brother's.

06:38.334 --> 06:40.251
I've never smoked.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.501
I'm just a little chubby...

06:44.167 --> 06:46.001
You've also got a bit of
a spare tire.

06:46.042 --> 06:47.917
But with some muscle.

06:49.084 --> 06:51.292
Do you want to see how long
I can hold my breath?

06:51.376 --> 06:52.876
- Now?
- Yes.

06:56.167 --> 06:57.626
OK, show me.

06:59.376 --> 07:01.251
- Press here, on 'start.'

07:01.876 --> 07:03.126
Ready?

07:05.626 --> 07:06.626
Go!

07:24.417 --> 07:26.751
Okay. That's good. Well done.

07:26.834 --> 07:28.709
- How long?
- Eighteen seconds.

07:29.542 --> 07:31.042
Once I lasted to 22.

07:31.167 --> 07:32.334
Great.

07:32.751 --> 07:34.459
I'm going to go rest now.

07:35.167 --> 07:36.917
Talk to you later. OK?

07:54.251 --> 07:57.876
<i>Today's nautical weather forecasts
a high of 16 degrees</i>

07:57.959 --> 08:00.917
<i>and winds from the southwest.
Thank you.</i>

08:02.251 --> 08:04.792
You must admit my stamina
is much better

08:04.876 --> 08:06.626
since I gave up smoking.

08:08.084 --> 08:10.542
You have incredible discipline.

08:11.709 --> 08:14.251
You're doing really well.

08:47.209 --> 08:49.167
Hello, sweetheart, how are you?

08:51.417 --> 08:54.501
Good. We're all fine.

08:59.126 --> 09:01.084
We went diving.

09:01.417 --> 09:02.709
This morning.

09:03.459 --> 09:05.417
Yes. Your husband too.

09:06.001 --> 09:07.959
He caught some breams.

09:09.792 --> 09:11.792
Not too big.

09:12.042 --> 09:13.167
And Christos...

09:13.334 --> 09:15.001
got a giant dentex.

10:21.459 --> 10:22.876
There.

10:32.709 --> 10:34.709
Turn it.

10:35.376 --> 10:37.376
Little more.

10:56.751 --> 10:58.459
My baby.

11:08.626 --> 11:11.459
I think you've gone overboard
with the pebbles.

11:11.542 --> 11:14.376
I need to pee, and I've got
to move them.

11:17.334 --> 11:18.667
Okay.

11:21.042 --> 11:23.542
I'd love to find a pebble
that's totally round.

11:23.626 --> 11:25.709
Almost a perfect sphere.

11:25.917 --> 11:27.542
Think how amazing it'd be,

11:27.709 --> 11:29.501
to find a pebble like that

11:29.584 --> 11:32.292
since 99% of all pebbles...

11:32.376 --> 11:33.709
aren't round.

11:35.084 --> 11:36.167
Found any?

11:37.459 --> 11:38.626
No.

11:39.084 --> 11:41.042
But maybe I haven't
looked hard enough.

11:41.167 --> 11:42.626
I did find this one.

11:42.917 --> 11:44.626
It's pretty close to a sphere.

11:45.001 --> 11:49.084
And by looking at it I can say
its volume is about 33ml.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.751
Know why?

11:50.876 --> 11:56.126
Because volume is 4/3 pi R cubed, and
this one's radius is about 2cm...

11:56.542 --> 11:58.542
So 2 cubed is 8,

11:58.751 --> 12:01.209
times pi, is about 25 and a bit...

12:01.334 --> 12:03.251
24.

12:03.667 --> 12:05.126
4.8.

12:05.834 --> 12:06.917
56.

12:07.001 --> 12:08.084
11.2.

12:09.001 --> 12:10.751
- 82.
- 16.4.

12:11.167 --> 12:12.126
46.

12:13.126 --> 12:14.084
7.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.459
9.2.

12:16.667 --> 12:18.167
I got confused.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.334
Okay, okay...

12:29.542 --> 12:31.334
Anyway I won't keep you any longer.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.251
Have a good drive.

12:33.417 --> 12:36.376
And please don't drive too fast. Okay?

12:37.084 --> 12:39.376
Think about your old Dad.
He worries.

12:41.376 --> 12:43.959
Goodbye, Anna. Goodbye,
my child.

14:02.292 --> 14:04.042
To the sink please.

14:06.626 --> 14:08.084
And this one too.

14:10.001 --> 14:11.251
Bowl.

15:32.209 --> 15:33.584
<i>Attention, please.</i>

15:34.126 --> 15:37.209
<i>Tonight we'll perform minor repairs
to our generator.</i>

15:38.001 --> 15:40.917
<i>As we do this work, the ship may
briefly lose main power.</i>

15:41.292 --> 15:44.376
<i>We apologize for any inconvenience.
Thank you.</i>

15:50.126 --> 15:50.917
Nope.

15:51.042 --> 15:52.334
You're out.

15:52.751 --> 15:54.126
The answer was Mr. Nikolaou.

15:54.209 --> 15:56.292
None of you got it, so I win.

15:56.417 --> 15:58.834
Please tell us how Mr. Nikolaou
looks like a panda.

15:58.917 --> 16:01.084
It's my subjective opinion.

16:01.626 --> 16:03.584
He looks like a panda because

16:03.709 --> 16:05.959
his body type exudes kindness...

16:06.042 --> 16:08.709
He's got a beard, dark circles
under his eyes...

16:08.917 --> 16:10.459
like a teddy-bear.

16:10.542 --> 16:12.251
I don't mind being a panda.

16:12.626 --> 16:15.876
Excuse me, but the panda is an animal
with a very large body-type.

16:16.417 --> 16:19.251
Yes Christos, but a baby panda
has a small body-type.

16:19.376 --> 16:21.126
Exactly. Small panda, small body.

16:21.209 --> 16:22.001
Wrong.

16:22.084 --> 16:23.876
A panda, of any age,

16:23.959 --> 16:25.251
is a plump animal.

16:25.334 --> 16:26.667
This guy is oblong!

16:26.834 --> 16:27.751
Christos is right.

16:28.001 --> 16:29.917
You have
to say baby panda.

16:30.334 --> 16:31.626
- It's not important.
- It's not important?

16:31.709 --> 16:33.042
It's very important.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.792
No, you should have asked
how old the panda was.

16:35.959 --> 16:38.251
I like that you
called me a panda.

16:38.334 --> 16:41.167
Hang on. This game is about
how we see each other.

16:41.251 --> 16:42.417
We don't have to agree.

16:42.542 --> 16:44.876
Shouldn't it refer to a
common perception?

16:44.959 --> 16:45.834
But that's it!

16:45.917 --> 16:48.084
It's because there's no such
common perception

16:48.126 --> 16:49.751
that the game even works!

16:49.834 --> 16:52.292
That absence is the whole
point of the game!

16:52.417 --> 16:55.792
Fine, and yet you must,
with every answer...

16:56.001 --> 16:57.084
Not every answer.

16:57.167 --> 16:58.251
Every answer.

16:58.334 --> 17:00.376
Every answer has to express somehow

17:00.459 --> 17:03.251
the essence of the person you're
thinking of.

17:03.334 --> 17:04.834
Are you going to censor
what I see,

17:04.916 --> 17:06.209
if that's what I see?

17:06.416 --> 17:08.041
- He's right.
- About what?

17:08.126 --> 17:09.751
I think Dimitris has a point.

17:10.166 --> 17:11.791
He likes being unconventional.

17:12.001 --> 17:15.209
I think there has to be consistency
in terms of common sense.

17:15.334 --> 17:17.084
Let's call it that: common sense.

17:17.291 --> 17:18.584
Precisely.

17:19.376 --> 17:22.084
Fine. You may all think
I'm wrong to see

17:22.209 --> 17:24.251
a resemblance between
Mr. Nikolaou and a panda.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.791
But I will not retract it!

17:29.376 --> 17:30.834
Can we continue, now?

17:31.001 --> 17:31.876
Who's next?

17:32.751 --> 17:33.751
Okay.

17:34.042 --> 17:35.251
I've got someone.

17:35.501 --> 17:36.626
If he was clothing?

17:36.917 --> 17:39.251
He'd be... a blue vest.

17:39.334 --> 17:40.626
If he was fruit?

17:40.709 --> 17:41.667
Pineapple.

17:41.751 --> 17:42.917
If he was a lighter?

17:43.667 --> 17:45.876
- What do you mean?
- It's a dumb question.

17:45.959 --> 17:49.251
I mean, an expensive lighter
or a plastic one?

17:49.376 --> 17:50.959
It's a dumb question.

17:51.167 --> 17:54.542
- He'd be...a plastic lighter.
- I think I got it.

17:54.667 --> 17:56.792
Careful, if you're wrong you're out.

17:59.126 --> 18:00.167
Wrong.

18:01.417 --> 18:04.376
If I were clothing I'd be a blue vest?

18:04.501 --> 18:05.584
That makes no sense.

18:05.917 --> 18:09.376
And there's no way in hell,
if I'm a fruit, I'm a pineapple.

18:09.459 --> 18:11.209
Pineapple for sure.

18:12.501 --> 18:14.251
Take back, right now,

18:14.334 --> 18:16.417
that if I were a fruit, I'd
be a pineapple.

18:16.542 --> 18:19.084
- Take it back now.
- I'm not taking back anything.

18:19.167 --> 18:20.251
It's unfounded!

18:20.376 --> 18:22.501
- You're a pineapple.
- It's unfounded!

18:22.709 --> 18:24.042
If he was...

18:24.584 --> 18:27.167
a state in the United States
of America?

18:27.751 --> 18:29.417
The cabin boy.

18:30.542 --> 18:31.876
The cabin boy?

18:33.209 --> 18:35.459
Yes. It's the cabin boy.

18:36.126 --> 18:37.876
How did you know?

18:37.959 --> 18:40.167
See that? Now who's the pineapple?

18:40.251 --> 18:41.167
Congratulations.

18:41.251 --> 18:43.417
You have two points and
you're ahead so far.

18:43.501 --> 18:44.501
Thank you.

18:45.667 --> 18:47.042
Who's going next?

18:48.417 --> 18:50.042
I'm not playing anymore.

18:50.209 --> 18:52.417
I'm tired and I'm bored of this game.

18:53.001 --> 18:54.251
OK. I'd be bored too,

18:54.334 --> 18:56.501
and give up, if I were losing.

18:56.834 --> 18:58.126
Just because you can guess

18:58.209 --> 19:00.126
who's a kiwi and who's a pineapple,

19:00.209 --> 19:02.542
doesn't mean you're better than us.

19:02.626 --> 19:04.334
In case you're wondering,

19:04.417 --> 19:06.209
you're not the best in general.

19:06.251 --> 19:08.251
You're the best at
that particular game.

19:08.334 --> 19:09.334
Only.

19:10.459 --> 19:13.501
All right, then let's play the game
“The Best in General.”

19:13.584 --> 19:14.584
How about it?

19:14.667 --> 19:16.709
But wait, actually we can't play that,

19:16.792 --> 19:18.626
because that game doesn't exist.

19:18.709 --> 19:20.126
Pity.

19:21.417 --> 19:23.501
Why don't we play something else?

19:23.584 --> 19:24.626
Cards, let's say.

19:25.167 --> 19:27.584
Unfortunately I don't know
how to play cards.

19:28.292 --> 19:29.667
I know a game we can play...

19:30.626 --> 19:33.667
but I don't know if we can
finish it before we get back.

19:33.917 --> 19:35.001
What game?

19:35.584 --> 19:37.251
I played it last year with friends.

19:37.376 --> 19:38.542
It's very simple.

19:38.959 --> 19:41.667
Each of us thinks up a contest
where we all compete.

19:41.792 --> 19:42.917
Anything you want.

19:43.001 --> 19:45.626
A physical test or
a mental challenge.

19:46.084 --> 19:47.626
We each score each other.

19:47.709 --> 19:49.417
And he with the most points, wins.

19:49.501 --> 19:51.001
Sounds fun.

19:51.084 --> 19:52.334
Well, I'm...

19:53.042 --> 19:54.584
I'm not sleepy. I'll play it.

19:54.626 --> 19:56.751
But now that I think about it...

19:56.834 --> 20:00.251
we can't play that without
a chevalier signet ring.

20:00.626 --> 20:02.334
Why the ring?

20:02.667 --> 20:04.251
Because whoever wins,

20:04.376 --> 20:07.251
puts on the ring and wears it
until the next game.

20:08.542 --> 20:10.584
We'll give him something else.

20:10.667 --> 20:12.126
It doesn't have to be a ring.

20:12.417 --> 20:13.542
We can't do that.

20:13.917 --> 20:15.626
How can we play a game
called “Chevalier,"

20:15.751 --> 20:17.376
and then give the winner...

20:17.459 --> 20:19.792
something like a glass of
water, or a vase?

20:20.584 --> 20:22.834
We could play a game called “Vase."

20:25.501 --> 20:27.626
Doc, what if, just to get started,

20:27.709 --> 20:30.001
you lend us your own
chevalier ring?

20:30.584 --> 20:32.126
Don't be ridiculous.

20:32.751 --> 20:34.584
Trivial Pursuit?

20:37.126 --> 20:39.792
Sure. Whatever you guys want.

20:40.334 --> 20:42.626
I do not play Trivial Pursuit.

20:44.584 --> 20:46.542
Yeah, I was just kidding.

20:50.542 --> 20:51.501
Fine. OK.

20:52.042 --> 20:54.376
Why don't we start this game now,

20:54.459 --> 20:56.626
and when we get back to Athens,

20:56.709 --> 20:57.959
we'll get a ring.

20:59.334 --> 21:00.876
Yorgos, are you playing?

21:01.751 --> 21:03.751
I'll play...if we change
the game a little bit.

21:03.834 --> 21:05.042
Meaning?

21:05.626 --> 21:07.126
When do we arrive?

21:09.417 --> 21:11.417
Hopefully tomorrow night.

21:13.709 --> 21:16.959
Okay, so I propose, until then,

21:17.042 --> 21:20.126
we don't judge each other
only on the chosen contests...

21:20.209 --> 21:21.251
But?

21:22.417 --> 21:23.876
...but on everything.

21:24.001 --> 21:25.167
Everything we do.

21:25.417 --> 21:26.834
How we speak.

21:26.917 --> 21:28.334
Loudly? Slowly?

21:28.376 --> 21:29.876
What words we use.

21:30.584 --> 21:32.126
How we laugh.

21:32.209 --> 21:34.334
If we show our teeth when we smile.

21:34.501 --> 21:35.626
How we look,

21:35.834 --> 21:37.251
and how we look at each other.

21:37.667 --> 21:38.959
How we walk.

21:39.501 --> 21:41.667
Why we walk and we don't sit down.

21:42.626 --> 21:44.209
How we think.

21:45.709 --> 21:46.917
Everything.

21:47.667 --> 21:50.626
And whoever is the best,
at everything,

21:51.126 --> 21:53.084
he wears the chevalier.

21:55.501 --> 21:58.709
In other words, the game
“The Best in General.”

22:00.542 --> 22:03.084
I'm fine with it. I'll
play it like that.

22:06.709 --> 22:10.084
When you say we'll grade each
other on everything,

22:10.542 --> 22:11.584
what do you mean?

22:11.792 --> 22:13.751
Whether we kill sea-urchins,
for example?

22:14.167 --> 22:17.334
Whether we kill sea-urchins or whether
our pants ride up too high.

22:18.459 --> 22:20.334
My pants don't ride up too high.

22:20.584 --> 22:23.042
They do, and you can ask anyone.

22:28.167 --> 22:30.251
Do my pants ride up too high?

22:30.834 --> 22:32.501
I think it's an okay height.

22:32.584 --> 22:34.334
An okay height. See?

23:07.709 --> 23:08.709
Thanks.

23:10.126 --> 23:11.126
Thanks.

24:06.251 --> 24:09.251
Nice underwear. Striped.

24:12.334 --> 24:17.084
His posture is excellent.
Straight back, straight neck.

24:18.042 --> 24:20.126
I don't think he's asleep.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.292
How can he be asleep already?

24:22.459 --> 24:23.501
He's asleep.

24:23.584 --> 24:27.834
It's odd he doesn't sleep nude,
although he's a nudist.

24:28.376 --> 24:30.251
That's because he's not asleep.

24:30.376 --> 24:32.792
I don't like the way he's sleeping.

24:33.042 --> 24:35.626
His body posture is too perfect.

24:35.709 --> 24:38.334
I don't like what I'm seeing.

24:38.459 --> 24:40.834
That's because he's not asleep.

24:41.001 --> 24:42.417
He's asleep.

24:42.501 --> 24:44.292
I don't know if I buy it.

24:44.376 --> 24:47.376
Still, his underwear is nice.

25:05.459 --> 25:08.876
<i>The captain and the crew would like
to wish you good morning.</i>

25:09.084 --> 25:13.042
<i>The temperature today will range
from 9 to 20 degrees Celsius.</i>

25:13.126 --> 25:14.417
<i>Thank you.</i>

25:47.626 --> 25:49.709
How many fillings do you have?

25:49.917 --> 25:51.251
Two.

25:51.376 --> 25:53.126
And one root canal.

25:58.667 --> 26:01.084
Did you have your teeth
cleaned recently?

26:01.209 --> 26:02.667
Four months ago.

26:04.542 --> 26:06.626
How many times a day do you brush?

26:06.709 --> 26:07.751
Three.

26:12.001 --> 26:15.584
Maybe...it's not enough.
I should do it more often.

26:16.959 --> 26:18.459
Good morning.

26:19.167 --> 26:20.834
Good morning.

26:21.501 --> 26:23.001
It must be abandoned, eh?

26:27.417 --> 26:29.126
Great day for jet-skiing!

26:29.209 --> 26:30.459
Bravo, Josef.

26:36.167 --> 26:38.042
Do I have time for breakfast?

26:38.126 --> 26:40.751
Yes, grab a bite.
What will you have?

26:41.542 --> 26:45.126
Coffee for sure, and maybe
some lemon cake.

26:46.251 --> 26:48.042
How do you like your coffee?

26:48.126 --> 26:50.209
Espresso. No sugar.
A splash of milk.

26:50.251 --> 26:51.584
Evaporated milk.

26:52.792 --> 26:55.209
I never put milk in my espresso.

26:55.876 --> 26:58.459
Especially not evaporated milk.

26:58.542 --> 27:00.834
Not that it's wrong.
I just don't like it.

27:00.959 --> 27:02.959
Sure.

27:30.001 --> 27:31.542
Josef!

27:31.959 --> 27:36.376
Everyone is awake, we're
ready! Come on!

27:59.042 --> 28:00.584
Can I go around again?

28:00.667 --> 28:02.084
No.

28:23.459 --> 28:25.001
What were you telling them?

28:25.084 --> 28:27.084
You weren't really asleep.
You heard us.

28:27.126 --> 28:30.126
As a favor, because you begged,
I brought you.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.709
Or else you'd be in Athens now,
with mom.

28:32.792 --> 28:34.084
Don't be ungrateful.

28:34.376 --> 28:38.501
I only observed that nobody could
be asleep in such a perfect pose.

28:39.792 --> 28:42.084
If you hit me again,
I'll tell everyone.

28:43.042 --> 28:46.167
And I'll tell everyone you're
afraid to sleep alone.

28:47.751 --> 28:49.209
Tell them. I don't care.

29:37.417 --> 29:41.042
For polishing silver, there's a
secret few people know.

29:42.001 --> 29:43.084
Tooth paste.

29:45.417 --> 29:47.126
You won't believe it.

29:48.417 --> 29:50.126
I wish you good luck.

31:10.876 --> 31:12.042
I'm done.

31:12.126 --> 31:13.084
I win.

31:13.167 --> 31:14.251
I finished first.

31:16.709 --> 31:18.001
Congratulations.

31:28.376 --> 31:30.251
The spoons aren't perfect.

31:33.251 --> 31:34.751
The tray? It looks dull.

31:34.834 --> 31:36.459
It's silver-plated, not silver.

31:36.542 --> 31:38.959
It's brass, that's why it
looks like that.

31:39.084 --> 31:40.834
The spoons aren't perfect.

31:41.209 --> 31:42.376
It's terrible.

31:42.459 --> 31:45.209
It's silver-plated. It
doesn't get any cleaner.

31:48.376 --> 31:51.084
Well you don't usually see the bottom.

31:55.292 --> 31:57.959
What's wrong with it?

32:17.001 --> 32:18.251
Help.

32:21.459 --> 32:22.501
Help!

32:25.584 --> 32:26.667
Help!

32:28.251 --> 32:29.667
What happened?

32:30.667 --> 32:33.459
You're the first who came.
Congratulations.

32:33.542 --> 32:35.667
- What happened?
- Help!

32:35.751 --> 32:37.334
Okay stop, that's enough.

32:37.459 --> 32:39.626
Will you stop? The Doctor is sleeping.

32:39.709 --> 32:42.167
In a contest like this, the Doctor's
the most important.

32:42.251 --> 32:44.084
Exactly because he's a doctor.

32:44.167 --> 32:45.042
Help!

32:46.251 --> 32:48.126
What is it, what's happening?

32:48.542 --> 32:51.876
The others said you wouldn't wake up,
but I told them you would.

32:56.626 --> 32:58.792
- What's happening?
- You came last, eh?

32:58.876 --> 32:59.626
Yeah.

32:59.709 --> 33:00.876
Who got here first?

33:01.626 --> 33:03.626
Yorgos, and me second.

33:19.084 --> 33:21.834
<i>Attention, please. We'd like
to kindly inform you</i>

33:21.876 --> 33:25.084
<i>that on tonight's menu the cheesecake
has been replaced by lemon pie.</i>

33:25.167 --> 33:28.542
<i>Thank you and we apologize
for any inconvenience.</i>

33:44.834 --> 33:46.792
Yannis, you're wearing shoes.

33:48.542 --> 33:49.834
Sorry.

33:53.584 --> 33:55.751
We never wear shoes inside the boat.

33:55.834 --> 33:56.751
We went over that.

34:17.876 --> 34:21.001
- What was your time?
- 18:01.

34:21.833 --> 34:23.042
Not bad.

34:30.458 --> 34:31.876
How's Anna?

34:32.833 --> 34:33.876
Anna?

34:34.251 --> 34:35.667
She's fine.

34:36.958 --> 34:38.792
How long since you've seen her?

34:38.876 --> 34:40.042
Long time.

34:41.001 --> 34:43.333
Since our Christmas party last year?

34:44.583 --> 34:45.626
Yeah.

34:47.251 --> 34:49.083
You haven't seen her since?

34:52.126 --> 34:53.126
No.

34:54.126 --> 34:55.583
She's terrific.

34:56.376 --> 34:57.917
She's very happy.

34:58.584 --> 35:01.542
I think...the happiest
she's been in her life.

35:02.084 --> 35:03.417
She nags me a bit,

35:03.501 --> 35:05.334
when I get home late from work.

35:05.417 --> 35:08.167
She cut her hair short and it
doesn't suit her, but...

35:08.251 --> 35:09.917
Anyway it'll grow back.

35:10.001 --> 35:11.001
She's fine.

35:15.126 --> 35:17.626
We were thinking of buying
a camera like yours.

35:18.001 --> 35:20.376
Especially if Anna manages
to get pregnant,

35:20.459 --> 35:22.542
we'll need a good camera.

35:24.834 --> 35:26.667
How much did yours cost?

35:30.667 --> 35:32.042
I don't remember.

35:32.501 --> 35:35.792
Have you considered it might be you
who has the problem?

35:37.209 --> 35:38.001
I don't think so...

35:38.084 --> 35:39.834
If Anna were 3 or 4 years younger,

35:39.917 --> 35:41.501
she wouldn't have a problem.

35:44.751 --> 35:47.792
Yannis, do you remember me
being an insurance agent,

35:47.876 --> 35:51.251
and advising you on your
homeowner's policy?

35:52.126 --> 35:53.001
No.

35:54.042 --> 35:56.251
And do you know why I haven't?

35:57.084 --> 35:57.917
Why?

35:58.001 --> 35:59.959
Because I'm not an insurance agent.

36:00.751 --> 36:01.751
So.

36:01.834 --> 36:03.417
Don't play doctor for me,

36:03.501 --> 36:05.876
and I won't play insurance
agent for you.

36:32.334 --> 36:34.209
Have a good rest.

37:33.501 --> 37:35.001
Don't put it out.

37:35.084 --> 37:37.001
I won't tell anyone you smoke.

37:38.042 --> 37:39.334
I wasn't smoking.

37:39.417 --> 37:40.917
But I saw you.

37:42.292 --> 37:43.917
Listen, it's okay.

37:44.292 --> 37:46.042
I won't tell anyone.

37:46.126 --> 37:49.084
You can come to my cabin and
smoke whenever you want.

37:52.084 --> 37:53.209
Thank you.

38:25.709 --> 38:32.501
<i>I fell in love with a shepherdess...</i>

38:33.751 --> 38:39.042
<i>a much admired maiden,</i>

38:41.251 --> 38:46.584
<i>But I loved her very much</i>

38:47.792 --> 38:53.834
<i>And I was still a songless bird,</i>

38:54.251 --> 38:59.542
<i>And I was still a songless bird,</i>

39:00.792 --> 39:05.959
<i>A boy of only ten.</i>

39:09.834 --> 39:11.209
Some tea with honey?

39:11.251 --> 39:12.417
No, thanks.

39:13.626 --> 39:15.126
Do you think he's impotent?

39:19.084 --> 39:20.542
Impotent in general?

39:21.834 --> 39:23.501
Unable to have children.

39:25.084 --> 39:26.917
We can find out easily enough.

39:29.209 --> 39:32.209
Bring him in to get tested.
At the clinic.

39:32.251 --> 39:33.751
No, no.

39:33.792 --> 39:36.042
It's not right. To force him?

39:36.792 --> 39:38.459
Force him.

39:38.751 --> 39:41.501
To come in and prove
to us that he's...

39:41.584 --> 39:42.667
fertile.

39:44.126 --> 39:46.792
We don't know anything about
their private life.

39:46.876 --> 39:49.167
Do they use protection?
We don't know.

39:51.584 --> 39:53.542
Is she on the pill?

39:53.584 --> 39:56.126
Does he insist? We don't know.

39:59.001 --> 40:01.792
You know Anna, she's sensitive.
She doesn't talk.

40:01.876 --> 40:04.084
She doesn't tell me what's going on.

40:04.709 --> 40:06.751
On the one hand that's a good thing.

40:06.834 --> 40:08.959
I don't want her being dependent...

40:09.667 --> 40:11.667
Being totally dependent on me...

40:14.334 --> 40:16.334
Which she is, to a certain degree,

40:16.417 --> 40:18.376
because it's something I strive for...

40:18.959 --> 40:21.417
And I acknowledge this
weakness of mine.

40:21.834 --> 40:24.084
I don't even know why you invited him.

40:24.167 --> 40:26.376
And he's also terrible at
spear-fishing.

40:36.501 --> 40:37.501
Christos!

40:38.334 --> 40:39.542
Come, join me.

40:39.626 --> 40:42.251
<i>A reminder that shoes must be removed</i>

40:42.334 --> 40:45.251
<i>before entering the main cabin area
of the ship. Thank you.</i>

40:53.001 --> 40:54.167
Want a sausage?

40:55.167 --> 40:56.251
No.

40:57.292 --> 40:58.751
Let me ask you.

40:59.792 --> 41:02.334
Sea-urchin salad. How do
you make it?

41:02.876 --> 41:05.376
The usual way. Olive oil, lemon.

41:06.084 --> 41:08.334
The ones we caught weren't full.

41:08.417 --> 41:12.417
You know, sea urchins are packed
with eggs at full moon.

41:12.501 --> 41:13.667
Yes, I know.

41:15.542 --> 41:17.417
Slipper lobsters are tasty too.

41:17.501 --> 41:19.042
- And funny.
- How's that?

41:19.709 --> 41:21.542
When you catch them.

41:21.751 --> 41:23.792
That sound they make.

41:27.209 --> 41:28.417
Beavers do that too.

41:29.626 --> 41:30.667
You catch beavers?

41:30.792 --> 41:31.626
No.

41:32.376 --> 41:33.334
What about calamari?

41:33.417 --> 41:34.667
I don't catch them.

41:34.751 --> 41:36.626
But I do eat them, and I like them.

41:37.376 --> 41:39.542
Know the secret to frying calamari?

41:40.042 --> 41:40.917
No.

41:43.542 --> 41:47.876
After you dry them, you wash
them thoroughly.

41:47.959 --> 41:50.792
The secret is to drain the
water completely.

41:50.876 --> 41:51.959
How, with napkins?

41:52.042 --> 41:54.376
Napkins, paper towels,
bits of cloth. Anything.

41:54.459 --> 41:57.042
You put them in a bag of flour
and shake it.

41:57.251 --> 41:59.417
Don't you get flour all
over the kitchen?

41:59.501 --> 42:01.542
I don't fry them in the kitchen.

42:02.209 --> 42:03.584
My wife yells at me.

42:03.667 --> 42:04.792
So where do you do it?

42:04.834 --> 42:06.626
In the garden. With a camp stove.

42:09.876 --> 42:10.917
Do you cook?

42:11.042 --> 42:12.084
Not really.

42:12.501 --> 42:14.126
But I do make a salad.

42:14.167 --> 42:16.126
Pears wrapped in
prosciutto and arugula.

42:16.501 --> 42:17.876
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

42:18.292 --> 42:20.251
I cut the pears in slices,

42:20.376 --> 42:21.501
put them in the oven,

42:21.584 --> 42:24.042
wrap them in
prosciutto, tightly,

42:24.126 --> 42:26.001
spread more prosciutto
around the plate,

42:26.084 --> 42:28.917
and at very the end, right in
the middle: arugula.

42:30.126 --> 42:32.459
Couldn't you also put the
arugula inside the rolls?

42:32.542 --> 42:35.084
You could. You're totally free.

42:35.792 --> 42:39.917
And for a dressing, I use
caramelized balsamic.

42:40.001 --> 42:42.834
- How do you caramelize it?
- At 120° C.

42:44.626 --> 42:47.167
- Raw fish, do you eat it?
- Raw? You bet.

42:48.417 --> 42:50.167
Mr. Nikolaou doesn't, I guess.

42:50.417 --> 42:52.251
With Josef you never know.

42:52.751 --> 42:54.251
Not openly, at least.

42:54.417 --> 42:59.834
He might hide in the toilet and eat
salmon carpaccio. Who knows.

43:01.792 --> 43:05.001
- You've been partners a long time?
- Eleven years.

43:07.334 --> 43:09.751
- A very particular man, isn't he.
- You said it.

43:11.167 --> 43:13.876
How long have you worked
for the Doctor at the clinic?

43:13.959 --> 43:15.084
Four years.

43:16.667 --> 43:20.501
And who will take over for him?
I heard he's retiring.

43:22.209 --> 43:24.126
You'd have to ask him.

43:25.876 --> 43:27.459
It's a big decision.

43:28.167 --> 43:30.251
The Doctor is smart.

43:30.792 --> 43:32.876
I'm sure he'll choose the best
man for the job.

43:40.001 --> 43:41.459
How old are your kids?

43:41.792 --> 43:44.959
My daughter's 16 and
my son's 12.

43:45.751 --> 43:47.042
I had them young.

43:47.126 --> 43:48.959
Well, not that young.
How old are you?

43:49.209 --> 43:51.126
Forty-five. But I don't look it.

43:56.417 --> 43:58.709
Wouldn't you have liked to play
the field a little more?

43:59.501 --> 44:00.667
Not at all.

44:20.292 --> 44:24.376
<i>The dinghy is ready for anyone who
wishes to go ashore. Thank you.</i>

45:14.876 --> 45:16.584
Sorry, Christos...

45:17.626 --> 45:19.626
It's OK. Don't worry about it.

45:54.126 --> 45:55.376
What are you looking at?

45:55.459 --> 45:58.459
- My hair? Is it a mess?
- A little.

45:59.626 --> 46:01.834
- Now?
- Better.

46:03.084 --> 46:05.292
Was it a mess before, or only
now with the wind?

46:05.376 --> 46:07.876
Only now. Inside you were fine.

46:12.584 --> 46:15.167
Have you thought of a contest?

46:16.334 --> 46:20.251
I have, but I'm not crazy about it and
it's making me anxious.

46:22.001 --> 46:23.251
Do you want to tell me?

46:23.334 --> 46:27.417
Sure. Everyone describes
his house, in detail...

46:27.501 --> 46:31.251
square meters, floor, and address,
and then we grade it.

46:34.501 --> 46:36.376
You're right. It's not
very interesting.

46:36.459 --> 46:37.751
No, it's not.

46:39.709 --> 46:41.209
Don't suggest it.

46:56.959 --> 46:58.917
Yorgos!

47:07.834 --> 47:08.751
Three!

47:09.626 --> 47:10.459
One!

47:10.584 --> 47:12.001
One is like none.

47:12.084 --> 47:13.001
Two.

47:13.167 --> 47:14.709
Is someone writing these down?

47:14.792 --> 47:15.667
I did.

47:15.751 --> 47:17.667
- Three.
- Two or three, which was it?

47:18.001 --> 47:19.001
- One.
- Four.

47:19.084 --> 47:19.751
Two!

47:19.834 --> 47:20.459
Three...

47:20.542 --> 47:21.376
three...

47:21.626 --> 47:23.084
- Bravo, Josef.
- Seven.

47:23.167 --> 47:24.042
Yeah, right.

47:24.126 --> 47:25.167
I don't believe it.

47:25.459 --> 47:26.626
Did you see it? Seven.

47:26.667 --> 47:27.542
Three.

47:27.626 --> 47:28.792
Josef, how many?

47:29.376 --> 47:30.917
I've done a whole variety.

47:32.459 --> 47:33.959
- One.
- Two, one, three.

47:35.917 --> 47:37.084
Write it down.

47:38.709 --> 47:39.876
- Josef?
- Four.

47:39.959 --> 47:41.584
Three, four, two, one.

47:43.542 --> 47:46.209
I think it's our best contest so far!

47:47.417 --> 47:48.626
What's wrong?

47:52.209 --> 47:53.626
You're not talking?

47:53.959 --> 47:56.417
- What you did wasn't right.
- What?

47:56.542 --> 47:58.959
Letting them throw my
pebbles into the water.

47:59.001 --> 48:00.709
You asked, so I gave them to you.

48:00.792 --> 48:03.292
You didn't say they'd be
thrown into the sea.

48:03.376 --> 48:05.209
I trusted you.

48:05.292 --> 48:07.126
Pebbles belong in the sea.

48:07.209 --> 48:09.626
No. Pebbles belong to me,
not the sea.

48:09.751 --> 48:11.251
These pebbles, anyway.

48:13.959 --> 48:15.542
Why do you want those
pebbles anyway?

48:16.042 --> 48:17.626
They're pebbles. We'll get more.

48:17.792 --> 48:19.417
I wanted to make a terrarium.

48:19.501 --> 48:20.251
A what?

48:20.376 --> 48:22.084
- A terrarium.
- A terrarium?

48:22.209 --> 48:23.167
Yes.

48:23.251 --> 48:24.334
What's a terrarium?

48:24.417 --> 48:26.042
If you knew what a terrarium was,

48:26.084 --> 48:27.959
you wouldn't throw my
pebbles in the sea.

48:28.042 --> 48:29.876
Will you tell me?

48:30.084 --> 48:31.917
No. Did you tell me?

48:32.042 --> 48:33.542
I didn't tell you.

48:35.417 --> 48:37.334
- But I did it for you.
- Yeah, right.

48:37.459 --> 48:40.126
Don't “yeah right” me.

48:40.667 --> 48:43.251
You shouldn't become so
attached to pebbles.

48:43.626 --> 48:46.542
Pebbles come, pebbles go.

48:46.834 --> 48:48.417
Other pebbles show up.

48:48.917 --> 48:50.792
When you don't expect them.

48:53.709 --> 48:55.584
Want to throw some?

48:59.792 --> 49:01.626
Nobody's stopping you.

49:02.042 --> 49:03.917
Well, I'm going to throw some.

49:19.667 --> 49:22.959
“My geometry professor
was very strict,

49:23.042 --> 49:26.459
and I knew he wouldn't tell me
my grade on the test..."

49:26.542 --> 49:29.084
With a little more feeling!

49:29.751 --> 49:31.209
If you don't mind.

49:35.001 --> 49:38.751
“My geometry professor
was very strict,

49:38.876 --> 49:42.709
and I knew he wouldn't tell me
my grade on the test...

49:42.792 --> 49:46.501
I was scared, but I had
nothing else to lose,

49:46.626 --> 49:50.126
as I approached his office, to
ask how I had done.

49:50.542 --> 49:54.459
Standing outside his door, I was
trembling with fear..."

50:04.542 --> 50:05.584
OK?

50:22.917 --> 50:23.959
Josef?

50:24.501 --> 50:26.834
And remember: I've seen your dick,

50:26.876 --> 50:29.792
because you show it to us every
time you go swimming,

50:29.876 --> 50:31.709
and it's not what you'd
call a big dick.

50:31.792 --> 50:34.334
First of all, you know that a penis
which is not erect

50:34.417 --> 50:36.292
can grow considerably
when it is, i.e.,

50:36.376 --> 50:38.751
two penises where one
is smaller than the other,

50:38.834 --> 50:40.751
when they're not erect, when
they become erect

50:40.834 --> 50:42.334
the smaller can become the bigger.

50:42.417 --> 50:43.626
That made no sense at all,

50:43.709 --> 50:46.417
your syntax is shit and your
dick is very, very small.

50:46.501 --> 50:48.917
I don't insult you, I'm always polite,

50:49.251 --> 50:51.792
and I think my contest is very
fair to everyone.

50:52.459 --> 50:54.042
I merely said that...

50:54.126 --> 50:56.417
you alone didn't have
a morning erection.

50:56.501 --> 50:58.542
And I think it must
mean something.

50:59.167 --> 51:02.251
That I didn't have a morning
erection is completely irrelevant.

51:02.292 --> 51:04.417
Maybe I'd just had a bad dream...

51:04.501 --> 51:06.167
that you had died, let's say...

51:06.251 --> 51:07.417
and I was sad.

51:10.584 --> 51:11.876
Fair enough.

51:12.001 --> 51:13.584
Anyway, we're on a tight schedule,

51:13.667 --> 51:15.334
so I think you should get in there.

51:16.917 --> 51:18.959
And please make sure the
focus is sharp,

51:19.126 --> 51:20.959
otherwise we can't compare.

51:21.084 --> 51:23.501
Press the screen and it
focuses automatically.

51:23.584 --> 51:25.209
I know how to focus.

51:25.626 --> 51:27.167
Very good.

51:27.501 --> 51:28.917
OK, let's do it.

51:37.792 --> 51:39.251
- Ready?
- Yep!

51:41.167 --> 51:42.251
“Night had fallen,

51:42.376 --> 51:44.417
when I arrived at
the college courtyard...”

51:47.459 --> 51:49.709
I'm telling you, it was that story.

51:49.792 --> 51:53.001
The geometry teacher and the girl?
I couldn't imagine it.

51:53.209 --> 51:56.792
If it was the one about the girl
whose car breaks down,

51:56.834 --> 51:58.167
I'd have been fine.

51:58.292 --> 52:00.251
I'm not saying you have a problem.

52:00.334 --> 52:03.042
Maybe you were nervous, maybe...

52:03.126 --> 52:06.084
Maybe you were embarrassed...

52:06.626 --> 52:08.834
but you had better look into it.

52:09.167 --> 52:10.709
Okay?

52:15.626 --> 52:18.001
Hurry up! We're waiting for you.

52:20.501 --> 52:22.417
Come on, get up.

52:24.959 --> 52:26.876
Can you please tell me
what's going on?

52:27.001 --> 52:28.334
Nothing's going on.

52:30.876 --> 52:32.126
Want some tangerine?

52:32.251 --> 52:34.334
- Making fun of me?
- Not at all.

52:36.709 --> 52:38.167
You sit there and agree.

52:38.251 --> 52:39.417
You say, “Sure,

52:39.542 --> 52:41.167
take off some of his points."

52:41.251 --> 52:43.126
Points off from what? My cock?

52:43.209 --> 52:45.542
I think you're overly upset.

52:46.459 --> 52:50.042
Didn't we go together
to that apartment in Ilissia?

52:50.167 --> 52:51.042
We did.

52:52.542 --> 52:54.334
And when the client came to see it,

52:54.417 --> 52:58.001
didn't I fuck her in the kitchen?
Yes or no?

52:58.084 --> 52:58.959
I know it.

52:59.042 --> 53:01.667
Did I get a hard-on instantly,
yes or no?

53:01.751 --> 53:02.417
You did.

53:02.501 --> 53:05.459
Did I get it up without her
even blowing me?

53:05.626 --> 53:07.042
- I don't remember.
- What?

53:07.126 --> 53:09.459
You were on the balcony,
watching us and laughing.

53:09.542 --> 53:11.042
You're right. I remember now.

53:11.126 --> 53:13.917
So when those guys started with
the insults and sarcasm,

53:14.001 --> 53:16.792
why didn't you tell them to shut up?

53:17.251 --> 53:20.542
Why didn't you tell them, “guys,
don't make fun of Josef,

53:20.626 --> 53:23.459
because I've seen him in Ilissia
with a beautiful erection.”

53:23.542 --> 53:26.834
I didn't tell them because
it's against the rules of the game.

53:26.917 --> 53:29.209
What rules? There are no
rules to this game.

53:29.292 --> 53:33.126
There are no rules to this stupid
game you came up with.

53:33.209 --> 53:35.209
You didn't tell them because
you're ungrateful.

53:35.292 --> 53:37.126
You don't love me and
you're ungrateful.

53:37.209 --> 53:38.001
Are you crazy?

53:38.084 --> 53:40.042
- Oh, I'm crazy?
- Are you?

53:40.126 --> 53:43.042
- I've lost my mind?
-Yes, you've totally lost your mind.

53:43.251 --> 53:45.709
I've lost my mind? Is that it?

53:46.959 --> 53:48.876
Calm down, now!

53:49.001 --> 53:50.709
You better believe it!

53:51.626 --> 53:53.376
- You better believe it.
- Calm down.

53:53.501 --> 53:58.126
Our business is over. You and me,
we're over. We're through.

53:58.834 --> 54:00.501
Nothing's over, you dog.

54:00.959 --> 54:05.167
And you know what? You'll win.

54:07.334 --> 54:09.626
But you won't actually win anything.

54:10.167 --> 54:14.834
Even if you win, it doesn't mean
you're the best in general.

54:17.084 --> 54:19.042
We'll win together.

54:21.792 --> 54:25.001
- We'll win together?
- You and me.

54:27.001 --> 54:28.917
Together.

54:29.917 --> 54:31.792
Okay?

54:33.959 --> 54:36.751
Sixth place Yannis, fifth Dimitris.

54:37.084 --> 54:38.417
Fourth Yorgos.

54:38.501 --> 54:39.667
Third Nikolaou.

54:39.792 --> 54:41.751
Second Christos, first: the Doctor.

54:43.001 --> 54:45.084
6th place: Nikolaou,

54:45.709 --> 54:47.042
5th: the Doctor...

54:47.126 --> 54:48.792
- The Doctor in 5th place?
- Yes.

54:48.876 --> 54:50.959
Number 4, Dimitris.

54:51.042 --> 54:53.542
3rd Yorgos, 2nd: Christos.

54:53.626 --> 54:54.834
1st place: Yannis.

54:55.001 --> 54:55.876
Yannis?

54:56.001 --> 54:57.376
Why not Christos in first?

54:57.459 --> 54:58.917
I don't know Christos.

54:59.001 --> 55:02.917
Sometimes I think he's the best, and
other times he confuses me.

55:03.376 --> 55:05.667
I'm torn between him and the
Doctor for first.

55:06.626 --> 55:09.626
Now that I think of it, I believe
he deserves first place.

55:09.709 --> 55:12.376
Christos doesn't deserve first.
Don't even consider it.

55:13.292 --> 55:15.334
Like I said, I'm not sure.

55:15.417 --> 55:18.417
I don't know him, it's
his first trip with us.

55:19.042 --> 55:21.876
I might change my
predictions later.

55:22.417 --> 55:25.959
It's just that his room is neat,
and he's very polite.

55:26.376 --> 55:27.417
You?

55:27.584 --> 55:29.376
Whom would you put in first place?

55:29.626 --> 55:32.001
I don't know. Yet.

55:35.959 --> 55:40.334
I still put Yannis first.
I'm sure about it.

55:52.667 --> 55:54.334
The food was tasteless.

56:33.001 --> 56:35.626
- Are you OK?
- Yeah...

56:35.709 --> 56:38.417
But I'd like to keep that
between us.

56:41.042 --> 56:43.334
- It could happen to anyone.
- I know.

56:43.417 --> 56:46.417
But let's keep it
between us, okay?

56:49.501 --> 56:50.876
Okay.

56:51.709 --> 56:53.001
Thanks.

56:55.417 --> 56:57.001
Don't worry.

57:14.584 --> 57:17.834
<i>Winds are mild rising to moderate,
3 to 5 Beaufort scale.</i>

57:17.917 --> 57:21.792
<i>The sea will be disturbed, later a bit
disturbed, and then disturbed.</i>

57:21.876 --> 57:23.126
<i>Thank you.</i>

58:13.417 --> 58:15.501
Does anyone want anything
from the kitchen?

58:15.584 --> 58:17.709
I'm going to grab a bite. I'm hungry.

58:37.834 --> 58:39.751
Sea's a little bumpy today.

58:40.709 --> 58:42.501
Yes, it is.

59:07.667 --> 59:11.542
<i>We will dock at Faliro Marina, Athens,
in approximately two hours.</i>

59:11.626 --> 59:12.917
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:00:38.334 --> 01:00:40.334
You're sure you don't
need anything else?

01:00:40.417 --> 01:00:42.417
Yes. Thank you for everything.

01:00:42.626 --> 01:00:44.626
As always you were excellent.

01:00:44.917 --> 01:00:46.876
And as always I thank you
for your trust.

01:00:47.209 --> 01:00:50.126
- If anything does come up...
- We won't need you.

01:00:51.001 --> 01:00:53.042
I wish you a pleasant rest.

01:00:54.792 --> 01:00:57.209
I hope everything goes well,
and you win.

01:00:57.459 --> 01:00:59.001
That's what I wish you.

01:00:59.126 --> 01:01:00.959
Thank you.

01:01:20.042 --> 01:01:22.751
You two are not dismissed yet.

01:01:23.542 --> 01:01:25.167
I'll need you for one or
two more days.

01:01:25.209 --> 01:01:26.751
One or two, Doctor?

01:01:27.376 --> 01:01:29.167
Either one or two. I don't know.

01:01:29.792 --> 01:01:30.834
Maybe three.

01:01:30.917 --> 01:01:31.917
Maybe 20.

01:01:32.001 --> 01:01:33.792
- Is it important?
- Of course not.

01:01:33.959 --> 01:01:35.751
It's just about the provisions.

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:39.251
I'll be giving you a list of
what we'll need.

01:01:39.334 --> 01:01:40.417
Certainly.

01:01:41.876 --> 01:01:43.709
That will be all.

01:01:47.792 --> 01:01:48.584
Hello.

01:01:48.667 --> 01:01:50.001
Hi, how are you?

01:01:50.417 --> 01:01:51.584
Fine.

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:53.501
Have you arrived?

01:01:54.584 --> 01:01:57.042
No, and we're going to be late.

01:01:57.126 --> 01:02:01.709
Tomorrow afternoon we'll try to
set out again, and we'll see...

01:02:01.834 --> 01:02:02.876
Okay.

01:02:03.709 --> 01:02:05.001
Is it very windy?

01:02:05.542 --> 01:02:06.751
Quite.

01:02:06.876 --> 01:02:10.084
But don't worry.
There's no reason to worry.

01:02:10.209 --> 01:02:14.167
It's just that I wanted to be
home today, to see you.

01:02:15.126 --> 01:02:16.334
I've missed you.

01:02:19.126 --> 01:02:20.667
Have you missed me?

01:02:20.834 --> 01:02:22.459
Sure. I've missed you.

01:02:25.042 --> 01:02:26.376
Do you love me?

01:02:26.792 --> 01:02:28.251
Yes, I love you.

01:02:28.834 --> 01:02:30.834
Are you sure everything's okay there?

01:02:30.876 --> 01:02:32.959
Yes. Everything's fine.

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:35.376
You? Any news?

01:02:35.459 --> 01:02:37.126
Nothing much.

01:02:37.209 --> 01:02:39.792
They came to clear out
the garden today.

01:02:39.876 --> 01:02:43.542
The rose bushes will die soon,
if we don't do something...

01:02:44.376 --> 01:02:45.417
Darling,

01:02:45.459 --> 01:02:47.834
speak up, I can't hear you.

01:02:47.917 --> 01:02:50.834
I said, the men who came
today for the garden,

01:02:50.959 --> 01:02:53.251
said the rose bushes need attention.

01:02:53.501 --> 01:02:55.501
We have to adjust the watering system

01:02:55.584 --> 01:02:58.084
and see if the oleanders
need pruning...

01:03:19.334 --> 01:03:21.584
So. I will now...

01:03:21.667 --> 01:03:23.917
make a call to my mother.

01:03:38.209 --> 01:03:40.459
Wait, sorry, I'm not ready.

01:03:53.292 --> 01:03:56.042
- That's the default ringtone, right?
- Yes.

01:03:57.417 --> 01:03:59.792
It's been like that
since I got it.

01:04:04.167 --> 01:04:05.501
Is that the sound of a frog?

01:04:05.709 --> 01:04:07.709
- No.
- What is it?

01:04:07.917 --> 01:04:10.709
A telephone sound.
An electronic sound.

01:04:11.167 --> 01:04:12.667
Why did you choose that ringtone?

01:04:12.751 --> 01:04:15.709
My son went into the settings,
and he chose it.

01:04:15.792 --> 01:04:18.167
Someone may give you an awful shirt,

01:04:18.251 --> 01:04:19.792
but once you put it on,

01:04:19.876 --> 01:04:22.292
the bad choice is no longer theirs,

01:04:22.376 --> 01:04:23.584
but yours.

01:04:24.001 --> 01:04:25.417
That's correct.

01:04:25.459 --> 01:04:27.001
I wasn't making excuses.

01:04:27.292 --> 01:04:29.834
And in any case, it's not
the sound of a frog,

01:04:29.959 --> 01:04:31.501
it's a simple electronic sound.

01:04:31.876 --> 01:04:32.751
Of a frog.

01:04:32.834 --> 01:04:34.917
Excuse me, but maybe he
hasn't changed it

01:04:35.001 --> 01:04:36.251
to not upset his son.

01:04:36.334 --> 01:04:37.126
Precisely.

01:04:37.251 --> 01:04:39.126
Just a moment. We're asking Yorgos,

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:40.876
We're not asking you.

01:04:40.959 --> 01:04:42.834
I didn't answer. I only hypothesized.

01:04:42.917 --> 01:04:45.376
No, no. A specific question
was put to Yorgos,

01:04:45.459 --> 01:04:46.876
and Yorgos should answer.

01:04:46.959 --> 01:04:49.292
I didn't answer, I only
hypothesized. Right?

01:04:49.376 --> 01:04:51.001
Dimitris's hypothesis was correct.

01:05:01.626 --> 01:05:03.334
You're a very beautiful woman.

01:05:06.626 --> 01:05:09.667
Why is such a beautiful woman
here alone...

01:05:10.251 --> 01:05:13.001
by the road, at this hour?

01:05:13.584 --> 01:05:17.126
No spare tire? Well,
that is a problem!

01:05:17.334 --> 01:05:20.626
Let's see if there's anything
I can do to fix it.

01:05:20.709 --> 01:05:23.209
Let's see. It's difficult.

01:05:23.376 --> 01:05:25.376
It's difficult but let's see.

01:05:54.917 --> 01:05:56.584
Yorgos?

01:06:01.292 --> 01:06:02.292
Yorgos?

01:06:04.167 --> 01:06:05.626
Are you asleep?

01:06:06.834 --> 01:06:08.542
I've got a beautiful erection,

01:06:08.626 --> 01:06:11.917
enduring and engorged.

01:06:12.126 --> 01:06:14.209
Open up, let me show you.

01:06:15.501 --> 01:06:16.792
Yorgos?

01:06:18.126 --> 01:06:19.417
Yannis?

01:06:20.459 --> 01:06:22.292
Go call that geometry professor,

01:06:22.417 --> 01:06:24.334
I've got something for him.

01:06:30.042 --> 01:06:31.334
Whoever wants to,

01:06:31.417 --> 01:06:33.501
can come out and get fucked.

01:06:34.167 --> 01:06:36.376
Come on, I don't have all night.

01:06:36.459 --> 01:06:38.251
I'm too busy!

01:06:55.626 --> 01:06:57.626
Do you want me to fuck you?

01:06:58.209 --> 01:07:00.251
I have a really great erection.

01:07:01.251 --> 01:07:03.251
Do you want me to fuck you?

01:07:20.417 --> 01:07:21.917
Come now, drink this.

01:07:24.376 --> 01:07:27.001
<i>One crazy night in Lilliput City,</i>

01:07:27.751 --> 01:07:30.709
<i>In the purple Lilliput City...</i>

01:07:31.167 --> 01:07:35.001
<i>In the cake-shop of the
Sugar-saurus...</i>

01:07:35.209 --> 01:07:38.501
<i>I was throwing doughnuts in
the air for you!</i>

01:07:38.709 --> 01:07:41.917
<i>And you spread jam all over me!</i>

01:07:42.417 --> 01:07:45.251
<i>So get ready because I'm
coming back...</i>

01:07:45.334 --> 01:07:47.417
<i>to Lilliput City!</i>

01:07:48.042 --> 01:07:50.792
<i>Get ready because I'm coming back</i>

01:07:50.876 --> 01:07:52.959
<i>to Lilliput City!</i>

01:08:10.251 --> 01:08:13.001
I thought you were exaggerating,
but you were right.

01:08:13.209 --> 01:08:15.167
He does snore loudly.

01:08:15.251 --> 01:08:17.876
Of course he may have a
sinus problem,

01:08:18.792 --> 01:08:19.917
or infected adenoids.

01:08:20.126 --> 01:08:22.709
I'm sure he's started smoking again.

01:08:22.792 --> 01:08:25.542
Earlier I saw cigarettes and a
lighter on his desk.

01:08:25.626 --> 01:08:26.542
Silk Cut?

01:08:26.626 --> 01:08:27.751
Yes. You saw them too?

01:08:27.834 --> 01:08:29.292
They're not his. They're mine.

01:08:29.376 --> 01:08:31.751
I forgot them on deck and he
probably noticed them.

01:08:31.834 --> 01:08:33.417
- You smoke?
- Shhhh...

01:08:33.834 --> 01:08:34.751
You smoke?

01:08:34.834 --> 01:08:36.417
I smoke. A little.

01:08:55.626 --> 01:08:58.084
There's drool on the pillow.

01:09:27.292 --> 01:09:29.167
Next, please.

01:09:31.251 --> 01:09:33.167
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:09:34.917 --> 01:09:37.542
- How are you today?
- Fine.

01:09:38.167 --> 01:09:40.126
You seem a little pale.

01:09:40.501 --> 01:09:41.751
I'm fine.

01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:44.501
Roll up your sleeve please.

01:10:16.459 --> 01:10:17.334
Done.

01:10:18.251 --> 01:10:19.792
Would you like some orange juice?

01:10:19.917 --> 01:10:21.084
No, I'm okay.

01:10:26.001 --> 01:10:27.792
Next please.

01:10:31.126 --> 01:10:32.917
Who's next?

01:10:35.292 --> 01:10:38.251
Good morning, Dimitris.
Have a seat.

01:10:40.959 --> 01:10:42.292
Roll up your sleeve.

01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:56.709
Make a fist,

01:10:56.792 --> 01:10:58.626
and take a deep breath.

01:10:59.376 --> 01:11:00.334
Sorry, sorry...

01:11:00.417 --> 01:11:01.834
I need some time.

01:11:01.917 --> 01:11:03.209
It's nothing.

01:11:03.292 --> 01:11:04.834
Just a little prick.

01:11:04.959 --> 01:11:06.542
Turn the other way,

01:11:06.626 --> 01:11:08.542
so you don't see the needle.

01:11:08.959 --> 01:11:10.042
Like that.

01:11:10.876 --> 01:11:12.459
I don't want to give blood.

01:11:12.542 --> 01:11:13.626
Can I not give blood?

01:11:13.709 --> 01:11:14.542
Of course...

01:11:14.626 --> 01:11:16.917
but realize there
will be consequences.

01:11:17.042 --> 01:11:18.251
Please try.

01:11:18.376 --> 01:11:20.417
It's a shame if you don't.

01:11:20.501 --> 01:11:23.209
It won't hurt, trust me. It's nothing.

01:11:23.292 --> 01:11:24.917
I have a recent chest X-ray.

01:11:25.001 --> 01:11:26.834
I can have it brought
here if you want.

01:11:26.917 --> 01:11:27.959
Don't be afraid.

01:11:28.042 --> 01:11:29.751
It will only take a moment.

01:11:31.251 --> 01:11:33.876
No, I can't do it,
I'm sorry, I can't.

01:11:34.001 --> 01:11:36.084
All right...listen.

01:11:36.167 --> 01:11:37.084
Sit.

01:11:38.542 --> 01:11:39.792
Sit.

01:11:40.834 --> 01:11:42.001
Close your eyes.

01:11:42.084 --> 01:11:44.084
And I'll apply a special ointment.

01:11:44.334 --> 01:11:47.251
It burns a bit, but then you
won't feel anything.

01:11:47.334 --> 01:11:48.376
Okay?

01:11:50.834 --> 01:11:52.292
Close your eyes.

01:11:55.417 --> 01:11:58.542
Now I'll apply the special
ointment, okay?

01:12:04.459 --> 01:12:05.917
You lied to me!

01:12:06.167 --> 01:12:08.959
I knew you'd lie to me.
That wasn't fair.

01:12:09.042 --> 01:12:10.709
I was straight with you,

01:12:10.792 --> 01:12:11.709
but you weren't.

01:12:11.792 --> 01:12:13.251
That wasn't nice.

01:12:13.334 --> 01:12:15.542
Your behavior is appalling.

01:12:15.626 --> 01:12:18.334
Forgive me. I apologize.
You're right.

01:12:18.417 --> 01:12:19.251
I'm sorry.

01:12:20.834 --> 01:12:21.584
Dimitris?

01:12:33.959 --> 01:12:35.167
Why the hell are you smoking?

01:12:35.251 --> 01:12:36.792
I just started now.

01:12:39.959 --> 01:12:43.001
Okay, you don't need this.

01:12:43.084 --> 01:12:45.084
And don't beat yourself up.

01:12:45.167 --> 01:12:49.084
I know that if the doctor
had insisted a bit more,

01:12:49.167 --> 01:12:50.251
you would have done it.

01:12:56.584 --> 01:13:00.001
I've given you really high points.

01:13:00.626 --> 01:13:01.751
That's great.

01:13:03.667 --> 01:13:05.084
And to Christos?

01:13:05.209 --> 01:13:06.584
Christos too.

01:13:07.459 --> 01:13:10.542
But more points to you...so far.

01:13:14.084 --> 01:13:16.251
I've given you high points too.

01:13:20.626 --> 01:13:22.126
Wasn't I doing fine until today?

01:13:22.251 --> 01:13:24.084
You certainly were.

01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:26.542
And you'll keep on doing well.

01:14:19.751 --> 01:14:20.917
Finished!

01:14:21.876 --> 01:14:23.042
Finished!

01:14:24.876 --> 01:14:25.917
Finished.

01:14:27.334 --> 01:14:28.376
Finished.

01:14:30.751 --> 01:14:32.251
Where'd that thing go?

01:14:38.584 --> 01:14:39.959
I'm done.

01:14:46.084 --> 01:14:47.251
What happened?

01:14:47.292 --> 01:14:48.542
What happened?

01:14:49.251 --> 01:14:51.376
The instructions were confusing.

01:14:51.459 --> 01:14:53.584
They weren't clear at all!

01:14:53.917 --> 01:14:55.667
Not to me anyway.

01:14:55.751 --> 01:14:57.584
Okay, don't fret.

01:14:57.667 --> 01:14:58.917
Maybe it was defective?

01:14:59.001 --> 01:15:00.542
You think so?

01:15:02.209 --> 01:15:04.084
Well, it's too late now.

01:15:28.001 --> 01:15:30.042
These eggplants aren't
good for stuffing.

01:15:30.126 --> 01:15:31.667
We needed the
flask-shaped ones.

01:15:31.751 --> 01:15:33.501
I told you again and again.

01:15:33.584 --> 01:15:35.084
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry's no good.

01:15:35.167 --> 01:15:37.709
I can't work with these eggplants.

01:15:38.751 --> 01:15:40.876
You have to go back and
get the right ones.

01:15:40.959 --> 01:15:41.959
Yes, sir.

01:15:42.042 --> 01:15:44.709
And what about the way to cook them?

01:15:44.792 --> 01:15:46.709
You remember what I taught you?

01:15:47.501 --> 01:15:48.751
We cut them in half,

01:15:48.792 --> 01:15:49.751
salt them,

01:15:49.792 --> 01:15:51.334
and leave them for 20 minutes.

01:15:51.417 --> 01:15:52.459
Enough.

01:15:52.834 --> 01:15:55.042
Go get the flask-shaped
ones and get back here.

01:15:55.126 --> 01:15:56.167
Right away.

01:15:56.292 --> 01:15:57.501
What will you get?

01:15:58.542 --> 01:15:59.667
Flask-shaped ones.

01:15:59.751 --> 01:16:00.792
What will you get?

01:16:01.792 --> 01:16:03.167
Flask-shaped ones.

01:16:04.376 --> 01:16:05.917
Blood sugar.

01:16:06.251 --> 01:16:07.501
80.

01:16:07.542 --> 01:16:08.917
72.

01:16:09.084 --> 01:16:10.334
91.

01:16:10.417 --> 01:16:11.584
118.

01:16:11.917 --> 01:16:12.959
103.

01:16:13.167 --> 01:16:18.417
Normal levels are from 70...to 110.

01:16:19.209 --> 01:16:21.126
If you're within that range,

01:16:21.209 --> 01:16:24.167
raise your hand so we can see you.

01:16:25.959 --> 01:16:27.167
Fine.

01:16:27.959 --> 01:16:29.376
Cholesterol.

01:16:30.167 --> 01:16:31.251
Maybe...

01:16:31.501 --> 01:16:33.459
Should we do creatinine first?

01:16:33.876 --> 01:16:35.959
No, cholesterol comes first.

01:16:36.417 --> 01:16:37.501
129.

01:16:39.959 --> 01:16:41.001
180.

01:16:41.792 --> 01:16:43.376
257.

01:16:45.001 --> 01:16:46.001
140.

01:16:47.792 --> 01:16:48.917
Christos?

01:16:53.667 --> 01:16:55.542
- Yes?
- 260.

01:16:56.251 --> 01:16:57.959
260, Christos?

01:16:58.084 --> 01:17:00.334
I thought you were watching
your nutrition.

01:17:00.626 --> 01:17:02.167
That's not good.

01:17:02.251 --> 01:17:05.459
I too thought you were
watching your nutrition.

01:17:05.834 --> 01:17:07.709
As for me I can easily call

01:17:07.792 --> 01:17:11.376
and have that chest X-ray
brought here.

01:17:11.459 --> 01:17:12.709
If you'd like.

01:17:16.626 --> 01:17:18.042
Triglycerides.

01:17:33.876 --> 01:17:37.542
You were good on the phone. Thanks.

01:17:38.376 --> 01:17:40.292
You helped me a lot.

01:17:41.209 --> 01:17:43.792
They were all convinced we're
very happy together.

01:17:46.042 --> 01:17:47.501
I don't know why...

01:17:48.126 --> 01:17:49.834
I'm stressed out.

01:17:51.167 --> 01:17:54.001
No, I'm doing OK, but...
I don't know...

01:17:59.417 --> 01:18:02.042
You're right. I will.

01:18:03.584 --> 01:18:04.917
You're right.

01:18:07.876 --> 01:18:10.209
Do you think my thighs are fat?

01:18:10.876 --> 01:18:12.251
Are you sure?

01:18:42.917 --> 01:18:44.334
I'm the best.

01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:46.792
I'm the best, I'm the best,
I'm the best...

01:18:49.542 --> 01:18:52.001
My thighs aren't fat.
I'm the best, I'm the best...

01:18:55.834 --> 01:18:57.292
I don't have high cholesterol.

01:18:57.334 --> 01:18:59.459
I have low cholesterol!
I'm the best!

01:19:00.501 --> 01:19:02.042
I don't bite my nails.

01:19:02.209 --> 01:19:04.251
No - I do bite my nails! And
I'm the best!

01:19:26.292 --> 01:19:27.459
Are you cold?

01:19:27.501 --> 01:19:28.667
Me? No.

01:19:29.084 --> 01:19:30.667
Why, is it cold?

01:19:30.751 --> 01:19:32.584
- Are you cold?
- No.

01:19:32.667 --> 01:19:34.334
Doctor, are you cold?

01:19:34.417 --> 01:19:36.417
Are you kidding?
Not at all.

01:19:37.001 --> 01:19:39.376
I must admit, I am a little cold.

01:19:43.292 --> 01:19:45.042
Wouldn't it be great,

01:19:45.126 --> 01:19:47.126
to always be on holiday?

01:19:48.042 --> 01:19:50.042
That would really be perfect.

01:19:50.126 --> 01:19:51.167
You're cold?

01:19:51.251 --> 01:19:52.042
No.

01:20:13.084 --> 01:20:15.584
I do apologize. I never...

01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:20.876
That hardly ever happens...

01:20:21.251 --> 01:20:25.251
It's probably all that garlic in the
stuffed eggplants.

01:20:31.167 --> 01:20:32.084
Dimitris?

01:20:32.126 --> 01:20:35.376
Will you show us what you prepared?
It's very impressive.

01:20:36.376 --> 01:20:37.376
Well...

01:20:38.251 --> 01:20:39.501
It's nothing really.

01:20:40.334 --> 01:20:43.042
You're being modest.
It's very impressive.

01:20:44.042 --> 01:20:45.126
Come on.

01:23:07.751 --> 01:23:10.084
What you did was totally idiotic.

01:23:10.167 --> 01:23:12.459
And dangerous, in this wind.

01:23:13.542 --> 01:23:16.376
Those fireworks aren't meant for that.

01:23:16.834 --> 01:23:18.459
I did it...

01:23:18.542 --> 01:23:20.042
Dimitris was singing, and...

01:23:20.167 --> 01:23:21.876
and it seemed like a good idea.

01:23:21.959 --> 01:23:22.834
I'm sorry.

01:23:22.917 --> 01:23:25.876
It had nothing to do with
Dimitris's song.

01:23:26.292 --> 01:23:28.001
It was unnecessary.

01:23:28.084 --> 01:23:31.792
It both endangered your brother,
and was pointless.

01:23:31.917 --> 01:23:34.626
It wasn't relevant, and it
was ridiculous.

01:23:34.751 --> 01:23:35.834
It was relevant.

01:23:35.917 --> 01:23:37.751
And everyone loved it, didn't you?

01:23:37.876 --> 01:23:39.084
I liked it.

01:23:39.167 --> 01:23:41.792
For me it was okay, I didn't mind.

01:23:43.751 --> 01:23:44.959
It didn't really fit.

01:23:46.334 --> 01:23:47.876
Oh, it didn't fit?

01:23:50.751 --> 01:23:52.084
It fit!

01:23:52.501 --> 01:23:54.376
It fit absolutely, and that's final.

01:23:54.501 --> 01:23:56.667
You're unfair, Doc, because

01:23:56.792 --> 01:23:59.626
if someone else did it,
you wouldn't reprimand him,

01:23:59.751 --> 01:24:00.917
you'd reward him.

01:24:01.001 --> 01:24:03.126
If Christos did it, you'd praise him.

01:24:03.209 --> 01:24:05.542
You'd say “Good job, Christos,
my boy!”

01:24:05.626 --> 01:24:07.626
Well I'm more...

01:24:08.501 --> 01:24:09.709
than Christos.

01:24:09.792 --> 01:24:13.376
Did you know I sold 170 insurance
policies last year?

01:24:15.584 --> 01:24:18.792
Can you even grasp that number? 170.

01:24:19.167 --> 01:24:21.917
So tell Christos to make a baby
with your daughter,

01:24:22.001 --> 01:24:24.542
because me? I don't really want one.

01:24:24.626 --> 01:24:25.584
If he can, that is.

01:24:25.667 --> 01:24:26.876
Because Anna said...

01:24:26.959 --> 01:24:28.792
Little Christos didn't do
so well there.

01:24:28.917 --> 01:24:29.834
Yannis,

01:24:29.959 --> 01:24:31.042
shut up.

01:24:31.126 --> 01:24:33.126
You think Anna hasn't told me?

01:24:33.209 --> 01:24:35.459
She told me what a loser you were.

01:24:35.542 --> 01:24:37.459
That you made her lick your feet

01:24:37.542 --> 01:24:38.751
to get a hard-on.

01:24:38.834 --> 01:24:40.542
It made her sick!

01:24:40.667 --> 01:24:43.084
And so did the gifts you gave her!

01:24:43.126 --> 01:24:47.376
Picture frames? Dumb greeting
cards that play music?

01:24:47.876 --> 01:24:50.042
And desk sets!

01:24:50.584 --> 01:24:53.167
She showed me your gifts and
we laughed.

01:24:53.251 --> 01:24:55.126
We still laugh at you.

01:24:55.209 --> 01:24:56.501
Apologize.

01:24:58.084 --> 01:24:59.792
- Apologize.
- No.

01:24:59.834 --> 01:25:01.209
Apologize.

01:25:01.251 --> 01:25:02.376
No.

01:25:08.042 --> 01:25:10.751
And if you must know, Anna
wanted that stuff!

01:25:10.834 --> 01:25:13.334
She wanted that desk set!

01:25:13.417 --> 01:25:15.334
I didn't choose it alone!

01:25:17.626 --> 01:25:20.126
But you have no taste, Christos.
Your taste sucks.

01:25:20.251 --> 01:25:21.834
It's a fact, what can I do?

01:25:22.042 --> 01:25:23.709
Apologize. Apologize now.

01:25:25.251 --> 01:25:26.501
A little lower please...

01:25:26.584 --> 01:25:28.501
I can't reach your feet
to lick them!

01:25:28.584 --> 01:25:31.751
So you can get hard and fuck
Anna and make a baby!

01:25:31.834 --> 01:25:32.667
Apologize!

01:25:32.751 --> 01:25:34.376
Take off your shoes!

01:25:36.292 --> 01:25:39.042
A desk set with a compass,
a letter-opener...

01:25:39.126 --> 01:25:41.501
a pen and a paperweight!

01:25:41.584 --> 01:25:42.876
Apologize!

01:25:46.459 --> 01:25:47.917
What a lovely letter-opener!

01:25:48.042 --> 01:25:49.459
What a lovely paperweight!

01:25:49.584 --> 01:25:51.042
What wonderful gifts!

01:25:51.167 --> 01:25:52.667
I'll put them on my desk!

01:25:54.167 --> 01:25:55.834
Josef, take him inside!

01:25:56.501 --> 01:25:58.751
You know that Anna still loves me!

01:26:00.876 --> 01:26:02.792
And those cards! So romantic!

01:26:02.876 --> 01:26:04.251
Oh! They play music!

01:26:04.334 --> 01:26:06.667
Oh, I love you, Christos!
I love you!

01:26:06.792 --> 01:26:09.001
I love your gifts!

01:26:09.834 --> 01:26:11.667
Christos I love you!

01:26:13.501 --> 01:26:15.792
I'm crazy about you, Christos!

01:26:16.959 --> 01:26:19.542
Lick my feet, Christos!

01:26:26.501 --> 01:26:27.834
Sorry.

01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:52.001
Sorry.

01:27:04.376 --> 01:27:06.376
If someone gets hypoxia while diving,

01:27:06.459 --> 01:27:08.001
is it very dangerous?

01:27:08.251 --> 01:27:09.959
Can you die?

01:27:11.834 --> 01:27:13.792
Yes, it's dangerous.

01:27:15.084 --> 01:27:18.459
The last time we dove,
Yorgos got hypoxia.

01:27:21.917 --> 01:27:23.876
Luckily I saw him in time.

01:27:25.584 --> 01:27:27.167
Until I took him to the surface

01:27:27.251 --> 01:27:28.459
and saw him breathing,

01:27:28.542 --> 01:27:30.209
I was really scared.

01:27:33.001 --> 01:27:35.459
When I think that he
could have died...

01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:38.167
It's horrible.

01:27:39.542 --> 01:27:41.876
I don't even want to think about it.

01:28:03.084 --> 01:28:05.001
Let me ask you something.

01:28:05.292 --> 01:28:06.209
Gladly.

01:28:06.251 --> 01:28:08.459
Do you think Yorgos is better than me?

01:28:10.251 --> 01:28:12.459
Look, I know it's a weird question.

01:28:12.584 --> 01:28:14.626
And you can't be objective,

01:28:14.751 --> 01:28:17.834
because of our long-time friendship
and your devotion to me,

01:28:17.959 --> 01:28:19.667
which is mutual of course,

01:28:21.209 --> 01:28:22.667
but I would like to know.

01:28:23.417 --> 01:28:25.209
If you think he's better than me.

01:28:25.334 --> 01:28:28.626
I know you don't think so,
but I want to hear it myself.

01:28:29.751 --> 01:28:31.667
Christos will win, won't he?

01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:35.834
Or Yorgos.

01:28:36.251 --> 01:28:37.459
Or Christos.

01:28:51.584 --> 01:28:53.542
Christos or Yorgos?

01:28:58.209 --> 01:29:00.126
Yorgos, or me?

01:29:04.376 --> 01:29:06.584
The finalists are Yorgos and Christos.

01:29:06.667 --> 01:29:07.751
The Doctor?

01:29:07.834 --> 01:29:09.751
The Doctor is next to last.

01:29:10.209 --> 01:29:12.001
He's very agitated.

01:29:12.084 --> 01:29:14.834
He kept playing with his
chevalier ring,

01:29:14.917 --> 01:29:17.251
taking it off, putting it on,

01:29:17.334 --> 01:29:19.042
until his finger swelled,

01:29:19.126 --> 01:29:21.042
and he asked me for some ice.

01:29:22.042 --> 01:29:24.001
Then he asked me to get
him cigarettes.

01:29:24.376 --> 01:29:25.542
A carton.

01:29:30.626 --> 01:29:32.417
It's just like I predicted.

01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:33.876
Nikolaou last.

01:29:33.959 --> 01:29:35.626
The Doctor next to last.

01:29:37.709 --> 01:29:40.376
How could he possibly have won,

01:29:40.626 --> 01:29:42.876
the way he's going so bald?

01:29:45.334 --> 01:29:47.126
Why are you staring at me?

01:29:48.042 --> 01:29:50.376
Your hair's beginning to
fall out as well.

01:29:50.959 --> 01:29:51.834
Here,

01:29:51.917 --> 01:29:53.001
and here.

01:30:08.917 --> 01:30:10.959
I hold you all in high regard...

01:30:12.542 --> 01:30:14.917
you and your families.

01:30:26.917 --> 01:30:28.959
I hold you all in high regard...

01:30:29.542 --> 01:30:31.876
you and your families.

01:30:33.709 --> 01:30:35.251
So...

01:30:35.876 --> 01:30:37.167
I just wanted to...

01:30:37.417 --> 01:30:40.126
...on this occasion I
just wanted to say...

01:30:40.376 --> 01:30:42.334
I hold you all in high regard.

01:30:42.542 --> 01:30:45.626
You and your families.

01:30:47.917 --> 01:30:50.584
But I have to admit, I feel,

01:30:50.834 --> 01:30:52.709
as if I've won already.

01:30:58.834 --> 01:31:02.001
...regardless of what
your final vote decides.

01:31:02.959 --> 01:31:06.959
I want to thank everyone who
gave me high points,

01:31:07.126 --> 01:31:09.959
but also those who gave
me low points,

01:31:10.501 --> 01:31:14.542
because thanks to your
criticism and comments

01:31:15.417 --> 01:31:17.501
I have become a better person.

01:31:18.084 --> 01:31:23.209
All these days with you, you've
taught me many things.

01:31:23.876 --> 01:31:25.626
About underwater fishing,

01:31:25.709 --> 01:31:27.667
about making sea urchin salad,
Christos,

01:31:29.334 --> 01:31:30.792
meteorology...

01:31:31.459 --> 01:31:32.709
oceanography...

01:31:33.334 --> 01:31:34.584
astronomy...

01:31:34.626 --> 01:31:36.001
And Doc,

01:31:36.542 --> 01:31:39.084
You taught me something I wanted
to know since I was a kid.

01:31:40.334 --> 01:31:43.001
How to tell the Little Dipper
from the Big Dipper.

01:31:43.376 --> 01:31:45.209
I taught you about the Big Dipper.

01:31:45.334 --> 01:31:46.626
You too, Josef.

01:31:47.042 --> 01:31:48.667
And the Doctor. It doesn't matter.

01:31:48.751 --> 01:31:50.959
Maybe you taught me the Big Dipper,

01:31:51.042 --> 01:31:53.001
and the Doctor the Little Dipper.

01:31:53.084 --> 01:31:54.792
You, the Doctor, the Doctor, you...

01:31:54.876 --> 01:31:56.209
Okay, enough.

01:31:56.459 --> 01:31:57.917
What you're doing is unethical.

01:31:58.001 --> 01:31:59.626
Trying to influence our opinions,

01:31:59.709 --> 01:32:02.126
our votes...their votes...

01:32:02.209 --> 01:32:04.584
Christos, I'm talking about
love and respect here.

01:32:04.667 --> 01:32:06.542
Yes, it's a brilliant speech.

01:32:06.626 --> 01:32:08.459
And not at all self-serving!

01:32:09.417 --> 01:32:10.917
Go on, Yorgos.

01:32:20.792 --> 01:32:23.292
I'm sharing what's in my
heart with you...

01:32:23.376 --> 01:32:24.626
What are you doing, my boy?

01:32:24.751 --> 01:32:26.334
It's okay, carry on.

01:32:29.001 --> 01:32:31.167
And to show you my regard for you,

01:32:31.751 --> 01:32:33.334
and how close to you I feel...

01:32:33.959 --> 01:32:35.959
Put a few here.

01:32:36.626 --> 01:32:37.626
Thanks.

01:32:37.709 --> 01:32:39.834
Come on my boy. Finish up.

01:32:40.917 --> 01:32:41.751
So.

01:32:42.084 --> 01:32:43.417
To show you what's in my heart,

01:32:43.501 --> 01:32:45.751
and how highly I regard you,

01:32:47.042 --> 01:32:48.917
and how close to you I feel...

01:32:49.167 --> 01:32:51.459
I will invoke the Secret Society
of Friends...

01:32:51.584 --> 01:32:53.167
those brave ringleaders

01:32:53.251 --> 01:32:56.167
of our national uprising of 1821,

01:32:57.042 --> 01:32:59.459
who through the ritual of
the blood oath,

01:32:59.542 --> 01:33:01.626
through the exchange of blood,

01:33:03.042 --> 01:33:06.167
became linked through eternal ties.

01:33:10.876 --> 01:33:12.167
Seriously?

01:33:12.251 --> 01:33:13.959
This is the gift I ask of you.

01:33:14.334 --> 01:33:16.376
And I'm certain you'll offer it...

01:33:16.751 --> 01:33:17.751
And I'm ready

01:33:18.626 --> 01:33:19.876
to receive it.

01:33:23.001 --> 01:33:24.417
What the hell?

01:33:24.876 --> 01:33:26.542
Is that knife sterilized?

01:33:26.626 --> 01:33:29.209
I wiped it with alcohol and
held it over a flame.

01:33:29.292 --> 01:33:30.667
This is over the top.

01:33:30.751 --> 01:33:32.917
You've gone too far now!

01:33:35.126 --> 01:33:36.084
Come on.

01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:37.751
Someone?

01:33:38.959 --> 01:33:40.126
I don't know about that...

01:33:40.626 --> 01:33:43.417
I don't want to cut my arm,
I'll have a scar.

01:33:43.709 --> 01:33:44.709
Then cut your leg.

01:33:44.792 --> 01:33:46.376
Then I can't wear shorts!

01:33:46.459 --> 01:33:48.959
- Make the cut on your behind!
- Find someone else.

01:33:49.042 --> 01:33:49.959
Well?

01:33:52.292 --> 01:33:53.626
I'd like to think about it.

01:33:53.709 --> 01:33:55.417
Great, think about it.

01:33:55.542 --> 01:33:57.626
I think I won't be doing that.

01:33:57.792 --> 01:34:00.251
Somebody decide.
I'm bleeding here.

01:34:00.376 --> 01:34:02.917
Can we bandage the thing
before you make a mess?

01:34:03.001 --> 01:34:05.251
It'll be just a small cut!

01:34:05.376 --> 01:34:07.042
I won't do it. I'm sorry.

01:34:07.251 --> 01:34:09.001
This is really important to me.

01:34:09.251 --> 01:34:11.042
It's important to me.

01:34:11.167 --> 01:34:12.501
It's important to me!

01:34:17.251 --> 01:34:20.167
I will gladly become your
blood-brother.

01:34:20.542 --> 01:34:21.626
There!

01:34:21.876 --> 01:34:24.584
- Dimitri you're not serious.
- I'm serious.

01:34:25.251 --> 01:34:27.251
You wouldn't let the Doctor prick you,

01:34:27.334 --> 01:34:28.501
but you'll do this?

01:34:28.542 --> 01:34:30.667
Would you do it for me?

01:34:30.751 --> 01:34:32.542
We're already brothers.

01:34:32.626 --> 01:34:34.667
There's no point in being
blood-brothers.

01:34:34.751 --> 01:34:35.751
Great...

01:34:38.917 --> 01:34:40.417
- Did I do it?
- No.

01:34:42.084 --> 01:34:43.001
Did I do it?

01:34:43.084 --> 01:34:44.542
No. There's just a red mark.

01:34:44.667 --> 01:34:46.584
Turn the knife to the side that cuts,

01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:48.126
and press a little harder.

01:34:48.209 --> 01:34:49.459
Yannis, say something!

01:34:54.667 --> 01:34:57.376
Okay, I think it's all right,
Dimitris.

01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:59.917
Let's leave it a little
longer to make sure.

01:35:00.001 --> 01:35:01.626
A little longer? Okay.

01:35:07.167 --> 01:35:08.167
Okay?

01:35:10.251 --> 01:35:11.251
Okay.

01:35:20.251 --> 01:35:22.209
Come on. Sure.

01:35:23.167 --> 01:35:24.667
Bravo.

01:35:27.251 --> 01:35:28.917
Bravo!

01:35:42.542 --> 01:35:44.084
Thanks.

01:35:46.084 --> 01:35:47.917
You're smoking?

01:35:48.626 --> 01:35:49.834
Yeah...

01:35:49.959 --> 01:35:50.876
No...

01:35:50.959 --> 01:35:53.001
In the moment.

01:35:58.501 --> 01:35:59.876
<i>Where is it,</i>

01:35:59.959 --> 01:36:01.126
<i>Where is it,</i>

01:36:01.209 --> 01:36:03.251
<i>The little ring?</i>

01:36:03.584 --> 01:36:04.751
<i>Search for it,</i>

01:36:04.834 --> 01:36:05.959
<i>Search for it,</i>

01:36:06.084 --> 01:36:07.709
<i>You won't find it.</i>

01:36:08.334 --> 01:36:10.001
<i>You won't find it.</i>

01:36:10.459 --> 01:36:12.126
<i>You won't find it.</i>

01:36:12.542 --> 01:36:14.209
<i>The little ring</i>

01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:16.251
<i>That you yearn for.</i>

01:36:16.876 --> 01:36:18.501
<i>You won't find it.</i>

01:36:18.584 --> 01:36:20.209
<i>You won't find it.</i>

01:36:20.626 --> 01:36:22.251
<i>The little ring</i>

01:36:22.334 --> 01:36:23.959
<i>That you yearn for.</i>

01:36:35.042 --> 01:36:36.084
What happened?

01:36:36.167 --> 01:36:36.876
Nothing.

01:36:37.001 --> 01:36:38.459
Is that blood?

01:36:38.542 --> 01:36:39.459
Yes.

01:36:40.876 --> 01:36:42.376
They slaughtered each other.

01:36:42.459 --> 01:36:43.834
- Didn't you hear it?
- No.

01:36:49.376 --> 01:36:51.876
Just before the final vote,

01:36:51.959 --> 01:36:55.417
the Doctor insulted Christos in
front of everyone.

01:36:55.459 --> 01:36:57.001
He got mad and attacked.

01:36:57.084 --> 01:36:59.626
The Doctor grabbed a bread knife,

01:36:59.709 --> 01:37:01.626
and as they wrestled on the floor,

01:37:01.667 --> 01:37:04.251
he slashed his cheek, to the chin.

01:37:04.334 --> 01:37:05.751
Like this.

01:37:10.251 --> 01:37:12.584
Luckily Yannis broke them up,

01:37:12.667 --> 01:37:15.709
otherwise the Doctor would have
cut him to pieces.

01:37:18.251 --> 01:37:19.876
Yannis got hurt too.

01:37:19.959 --> 01:37:21.459
He got stabbed in the knee.

01:37:21.542 --> 01:37:23.626
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

01:37:27.251 --> 01:37:28.751
It probably cut a tendon,

01:37:28.792 --> 01:37:31.751
but if you see Christos's face
you won't believe it.

01:37:36.876 --> 01:37:38.376
Nikolaou left in tears,

01:37:38.501 --> 01:37:40.876
the rest are down in their cabins.

01:37:40.959 --> 01:37:42.709
An ambulance is on its way.

01:37:42.792 --> 01:37:44.792
Christos lost a lot of blood.

01:37:49.792 --> 01:37:51.209
You believed it.

01:37:52.042 --> 01:37:53.376
No I didn't.

01:37:53.876 --> 01:37:55.042
You did.

01:37:55.709 --> 01:37:56.709
No I didn't.

01:37:56.834 --> 01:37:57.834
Yes you did.

01:37:57.917 --> 01:37:59.126
I didn't believe it.

01:38:00.084 --> 01:38:01.167
Minus 6 points.

01:38:01.251 --> 01:38:03.959
I didn't believe it, you
can't take off points.

01:38:04.417 --> 01:38:06.584
Minus 12 for
being a sore loser.

01:38:06.667 --> 01:38:08.834
I won't lose. I'll win.

01:38:08.917 --> 01:38:11.084
You'll never get the
chevalier. Forget it.

01:38:11.167 --> 01:38:12.917
- Take that back.
- I won't.

01:38:13.001 --> 01:38:14.584
You have a boundless imagination,

01:38:14.626 --> 01:38:16.584
but none when it
comes to cooking.

01:38:16.667 --> 01:38:18.792
You'll never be promoted to chef.

01:38:18.917 --> 01:38:20.167
You're not a chef.

01:38:20.251 --> 01:38:21.501
You're a cook.

01:38:21.584 --> 01:38:22.751
Sorry.

01:38:23.751 --> 01:38:25.501
Take it back about
not being a chef.

01:38:25.584 --> 01:38:26.751
Certainly not.

01:38:27.292 --> 01:38:28.834
Take it back now I said.

01:38:29.209 --> 01:38:30.292
Let go of my tie.

01:38:30.376 --> 01:38:32.167
- Take it back.
- Let go of my tie.

01:38:32.251 --> 01:38:34.084
- Take it back.
- Let go of my tie.

01:38:34.167 --> 01:38:35.667
- Take it back!
- Let go of my tie!

01:38:35.792 --> 01:38:37.917
- Let go of my tie!
- Apologize now!
