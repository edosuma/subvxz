WEBVTT

00:08.483 --> 00:09.950
I missed my alarm!

00:09.951 --> 00:11.454
- I'm up! I'm up!
- No, no, no. Sorry.

00:11.455 --> 00:13.423
I just went for an early run.

00:13.424 --> 00:15.158
That's right, you have the FBI,

00:15.159 --> 00:17.460
and I have ten more minutes.

00:17.461 --> 00:18.695
Go away, roommate.

00:18.696 --> 00:21.932
Look, I got you one of
those cinnamon rolls you like

00:21.933 --> 00:23.999
from Maggie's.

00:25.735 --> 00:28.605
The kind with the cream cheese on top?

00:28.606 --> 00:29.973
Yeah..

00:29.974 --> 00:32.308
And a nomination for
the Nobel Peace Prize.

00:33.211 --> 00:35.011
- What?
- Look.

00:35.012 --> 00:37.080
Wait, they put that in the article?

00:37.081 --> 00:39.115
Nice cover photo.

00:39.116 --> 00:41.351
They weren't supposed to
mention the nomination.

00:41.352 --> 00:42.619
It's just a rumor.

00:42.620 --> 00:46.156
Kissinger is so jealous right now.

00:46.157 --> 00:49.159
Geez. What'd they do to my face?

00:49.160 --> 00:50.427
What do you mean?

00:50.428 --> 00:53.430
I look like a creepy plastic doll.

00:53.431 --> 00:55.165
Well, the article is great.

00:55.166 --> 00:57.701
It's all about the
Israel-Iran peace talks.

00:57.702 --> 00:59.936
Look, it-it's nice
you're getting some notice

00:59.937 --> 01:02.138
after all this crazy work
you've been putting in.

01:02.139 --> 01:04.007
I must've worked myself to death.

01:04.007 --> 01:06.676
I mean, I look like a corpse.

01:10.881 --> 01:14.584
What, you think if they didn't
erase all the lines on my face,

01:14.585 --> 01:16.119
- I'd be disappointed.
- Yeah, I...

01:16.120 --> 01:18.622
I think I'm gonna take a shower.

01:18.623 --> 01:21.024
See why the FBI needs me again.

01:21.025 --> 01:22.359
I bet they wouldn't have

01:22.360 --> 01:23.827
worked over Henry Kissinger's face

01:23.828 --> 01:26.529
till he looked like a pressed sheet.

01:28.799 --> 01:31.635
There's a good picture
of Rabbi Lowenthal.

01:31.636 --> 01:33.236
Yeah, I saw that.

01:33.237 --> 01:35.939
What a brilliant idea,
getting Israel and Iranian kids

01:35.940 --> 01:37.440
to play soccer together.

01:37.441 --> 01:39.542
He actually got President Shiraz

01:39.543 --> 01:41.544
and the Israeli prime minister

01:41.545 --> 01:44.014
to agree to go to the
game in Jordan next week.

01:44.015 --> 01:46.983
Guy's better at wrangling
world leaders than I am.

01:46.984 --> 01:50.020
Maybe he should get a
Nobel Peace Prize instead.

01:52.023 --> 01:54.824
Seriously.

01:54.825 --> 01:58.228
Are my... crow's feet that bad

01:58.229 --> 02:00.263
that they need to be erased?

02:00.264 --> 02:03.198
I love every inch of
your beautiful face.

02:05.535 --> 02:07.270
Virginia Field Force.

02:07.271 --> 02:09.472
Pretty much your standard militia group.

02:09.473 --> 02:12.142
Anti-government, little
white supremacy, lots of guns

02:12.143 --> 02:13.376
and tactical gear.

02:13.377 --> 02:15.979
I still don't understand
why you need me.

02:15.980 --> 02:18.348
One of the ex-Covenant of
John members we interviewed

02:18.349 --> 02:20.216
had a cousin in a militia group.

02:20.217 --> 02:21.651
We looked into it.

02:21.652 --> 02:24.054
Couple of ex-COJ members
posted on their Web site.

02:24.055 --> 02:26.790
So the legion of angels
is looking for soldiers.

02:26.791 --> 02:29.292
Makes sense if they're
planning some kind of action.

02:29.293 --> 02:31.895
It's hard to see what the
militia gets out of it.

02:31.896 --> 02:34.731
Well, they both share
the same goal, right?

02:34.732 --> 02:37.067
Burn down the basic
structures of society.

02:37.068 --> 02:39.169
COJ gets guns and know-how,

02:39.170 --> 02:41.970
and militia gets a righteous ideology.

02:42.906 --> 02:45.241
And if COJ does have a
bomb from Rex Mayfield...

02:45.242 --> 02:47.410
They bring even more to the table.

02:47.411 --> 02:49.379
Wow.

02:49.380 --> 02:51.723
So what are you thinking, watch
and wait or send a team in?

02:51.724 --> 02:54.284
We'd love to move in, if
we could only find them.

02:54.285 --> 02:56.186
They were in the mountains near Abingdon

02:56.187 --> 02:58.555
when ATF started tracking
them about six months ago.

02:58.556 --> 03:00.457
But then they pulled up stakes

03:00.458 --> 03:02.726
and got cagey about the new location.

03:02.727 --> 03:04.710
Could they have figured
out ATF was tracking them?

03:04.711 --> 03:07.364
Doesn't look like it.

03:07.365 --> 03:09.632
Ian Conroy.

03:09.633 --> 03:12.002
He's been working the group.

03:12.003 --> 03:14.671
Ex-Marine, deployed
three times to Iraq.

03:14.672 --> 03:17.307
They love this guy.
They want to recruit him.

03:17.308 --> 03:18.908
It could be a trap.

03:18.909 --> 03:21.177
It's the only way we're
gonna find out where they are.

03:21.178 --> 03:24.247
We'll have to take our
chances and be ready.

03:24.248 --> 03:27.283
So now you need me to help ATF Guy

03:27.284 --> 03:31.653
become an expert on apocalyptic
Christianity so he'll fit in.

03:32.555 --> 03:35.859
I love it when you're ahead of me.

03:35.860 --> 03:37.761
And here's the seating
chart for Camp David.

03:37.762 --> 03:39.896
President Shiraz will
enter from the east door.

03:39.897 --> 03:41.664
- Which Israel approved?
- Yes.

03:41.665 --> 03:42.932
I will confirm

03:42.933 --> 03:44.276
with the prime minister's office.

03:44.277 --> 03:47.937
Right. I do not want to
lose this peace deal over

03:47.938 --> 03:48.938
who gets the top bunk.

03:48.939 --> 03:50.440
Sorry, I just saw the seating chart.

03:50.441 --> 03:51.574
Is this right?

03:51.575 --> 03:53.643
Yes. We'll approve
the west entrance with.

03:53.644 --> 03:55.885
- Prime Minister Aaronson.
- No, no, no, the table shape.

03:55.886 --> 03:58.521
I spent three days getting both
sides to agree to an oval table.

03:58.522 --> 03:59.616
This is a rectangle.

03:59.617 --> 04:01.697
- It can't be a rectangle.
- That's just the diagram.

04:01.698 --> 04:02.676
The table will be oval.

04:02.677 --> 04:04.454
Can we confirm it's
oval? The actual table.

04:04.455 --> 04:06.823
With Aaronson on the
bulge-y part by the windows.

04:06.824 --> 04:08.425
Y-Yes, I-I will confirm.

04:08.426 --> 04:11.428
And the flowers have to be white.

04:11.429 --> 04:14.596
Hang in there, buddy. Almost there.

04:15.398 --> 04:17.200
No, I know. I'm just...

04:17.201 --> 04:18.535
Exhausted from negotiating

04:18.536 --> 04:21.538
every single detail of a
historic peace agreement.

04:21.539 --> 04:24.040
Jay, your wife is on the way up.

04:24.041 --> 04:25.241
Who's that?

04:25.242 --> 04:27.610
Tell her

04:27.611 --> 04:29.612
she gets you back as soon
as this thing is signed.

04:29.613 --> 04:31.548
Hours away.

04:31.549 --> 04:32.782
Good morning, ma'am.

04:32.783 --> 04:36.052
I know. NewsSource
Magazine mentioned the rumor

04:36.053 --> 04:37.720
about the Nobel nomination.

04:37.721 --> 04:39.923
I-I don't know how they got that.

04:39.924 --> 04:41.867
Nominations have been
rumored before in the past.

04:41.868 --> 04:43.526
It's not an issue.

04:43.527 --> 04:46.362
I'll gather the staff for the meeting.

04:46.363 --> 04:47.797
About the cover...

04:47.798 --> 04:51.935
You mean that I look
like my own... wax statue?

04:51.936 --> 04:53.570
I told them no retouching,

04:53.571 --> 04:55.872
and I was assured that
we'd get final approval.

04:55.873 --> 04:57.507
Obviously, that didn't happen.

04:57.508 --> 04:59.476
I mean, not that it's bad.

04:59.477 --> 05:02.045
Come on. It's pretty bad.

05:02.046 --> 05:03.880
Are we in here or
what? I-I'm all alone.

05:03.881 --> 05:05.648
Could you give us a minute?

05:05.649 --> 05:07.984
Hey, congratulations on NewsSource.

05:07.985 --> 05:09.368
You're officially trending online.

05:09.369 --> 05:10.253
I am?

05:10.254 --> 05:13.121
It's been, um... positive.

05:14.858 --> 05:18.128
Okay, that was a bad "um."

05:18.129 --> 05:19.863
What did that "um" mean?

05:19.864 --> 05:24.767
It hasn't been as focused on
the peace deal as we'd like.

05:24.768 --> 05:27.303
Some pundit on Twitter's
calling you Madam Sexy-tary.

05:27.304 --> 05:29.706
Could you get back in your crate?

05:29.707 --> 05:31.374
What? It's true.

05:31.375 --> 05:35.845
Frankly, I'm surprised anyone
finds that weird Photoshop sexy.

05:35.846 --> 05:39.482
No, this is,
more about your blouse.

05:39.483 --> 05:42.785
What are they saying about my blouse?

05:42.786 --> 05:44.787
Hey. I just got your messages.

05:44.788 --> 05:48.091
No, that's okay. I figured
I'd better just bring it.

05:48.092 --> 05:50.293
You're saving me. Thank
you. I-I just, I don't know

05:50.294 --> 05:51.793
- where my head is.
- Elsewhere.

05:53.496 --> 05:55.565
So, it looks like this
thing could get signed today.

05:55.566 --> 05:58.168
How 'bout dinner at that bistro
you like? What's it called?

05:58.169 --> 06:00.703
Why don't you just let
me know how it goes first.

06:00.704 --> 06:02.771
- Hey, Abby.
- Hey.

06:03.573 --> 06:05.642
That's a gorgeous dress.

06:05.643 --> 06:08.378
And I am so wearing yoga pants.

06:08.379 --> 06:10.747
Stop it. You're totally working it.

06:10.748 --> 06:12.649
Hey, the car's ready for Camp David.

06:12.650 --> 06:13.883
Go.

06:13.884 --> 06:15.351
Make world peace.

06:15.352 --> 06:16.786
I got to get back to Chloe.

06:16.787 --> 06:18.887
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

06:20.256 --> 06:22.125
Aw, look at that.

06:22.126 --> 06:23.560
Personal life.

06:23.561 --> 06:25.295
I used to have one of those.

06:25.296 --> 06:26.863
Yeah. Me, too.

06:28.165 --> 06:30.033
I'm gonna need some coffee.

06:30.034 --> 06:31.334
Don't you have a car waiting?

06:31.335 --> 06:33.735
Don't you have a staff meeting?

06:35.838 --> 06:38.074
Yes. Frankie's hazelnut roast.

06:38.075 --> 06:39.342
Smells amazing.

06:39.343 --> 06:41.744
Yeah, she brought it back
from Seattle. Get on it.

06:41.745 --> 06:43.780
It goes fast.

06:43.781 --> 06:45.415
Hey, Kevin.

06:45.416 --> 06:47.116
'Sup?

06:47.117 --> 06:49.519
Hey, Kevin.

06:49.520 --> 06:52.222
I'm Jay. Have we met?

06:52.223 --> 06:55.124
This is Kevin from Budget and Planning.

06:55.125 --> 06:57.694
Guess you guys get a pretty
high security clearance,

06:57.695 --> 07:00.063
coming up from five to take our coffee.

07:00.064 --> 07:03.332
I'm just good at making friends.

07:06.336 --> 07:07.971
You gave that guy floor access?

07:07.972 --> 07:10.740
Yes, I did.

07:10.741 --> 07:14.043
And a member of the board
of regents at UVA invited you

07:14.044 --> 07:16.546
to a reception... something
about the Nobel nomination.

07:16.547 --> 07:19.448
Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.

07:20.717 --> 07:21.884
President Shiraz,

07:21.885 --> 07:23.553
welcome.

07:23.554 --> 07:25.822
Such a beautiful setting.

07:25.823 --> 07:28.725
It's been the site of
many historic meetings.

07:28.726 --> 07:31.928
I'm hoping today will
add to that history.

07:31.929 --> 07:34.330
We only lack a certain prime minister.

07:34.331 --> 07:36.466
Yes, he will be along any moment,

07:36.467 --> 07:40.903
as will my policy advisor with
our final negotiation framework.

07:40.904 --> 07:42.005
Let's sit.

07:42.006 --> 07:42.939
Thank you.

07:42.940 --> 07:44.507
You got to be kidding me.

07:44.508 --> 07:46.109
It's a small matter of language.

07:46.110 --> 07:47.610
Amin, how long we been at this?

07:47.611 --> 07:48.978
The whole thing is language.

07:48.979 --> 07:50.780
That's like saying we're all just water.

07:50.781 --> 07:53.182
Iran is obviously acknowledging
Israel's legitimacy

07:53.183 --> 07:54.450
by engaging in this agreement.

07:54.451 --> 07:56.058
We simply want to change a few words.

07:56.059 --> 07:58.292
Changing "Iran acknowledges
Israel's right to exist"

07:58.293 --> 08:00.023
to "Iran acknowledges
Israel's existence"

08:00.024 --> 08:02.091
is more than a word
change, it's a firebomb.

08:02.092 --> 08:03.475
We have agreed to pull Quds Forces

08:03.476 --> 08:04.594
from five other countries.

08:04.595 --> 08:06.596
We have submitted ourselves
to the humiliating scrutiny

08:06.597 --> 08:08.340
by the United States
of our defense weapons.

08:08.341 --> 08:10.333
We are cutting ties with
our political allies...

08:10.334 --> 08:12.101
But this is the main
thing that Israel wants.

08:12.102 --> 08:14.137
It's what got them to the
table in the first place.

08:14.138 --> 08:15.838
This is from our Supreme Leader.

08:15.839 --> 08:18.675
If we cannot renegotiate, I
have to resubmit every point

08:18.676 --> 08:21.476
for the ayatollah's reconsideration.

08:23.000 --> 08:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:32.355 --> 08:35.291
Prime Minister, I am so
sorry about the delay.

08:35.292 --> 08:37.092
It's just a slight hiccup

08:37.094 --> 08:39.128
in the finalizing of
the framework agreement.

08:39.129 --> 08:41.089
Well, we've come a very
long way, Madam Secretary.

08:41.090 --> 08:42.823
I know. We are so
honored to have you here.

08:42.823 --> 08:45.068
And you must be exhausted
from your journey.

08:45.069 --> 08:48.271
So, I tell you what, why don't
you guys go up, get settled

08:48.272 --> 08:51.207
into your cabins,
and... enjoy the scenery.

08:51.208 --> 08:52.508
Dinner at 6:00.

08:52.509 --> 08:54.332
We'll resume talks first
thing in the morning.

08:54.333 --> 08:55.812
Okay?

08:55.813 --> 08:57.980
He's gonna hear about the
"right to exist" issue.

08:57.981 --> 09:00.450
Yeah, I'll walk him through
it tonight at dinner.

09:00.451 --> 09:02.585
Do you know if scotch is kosher?

09:03.887 --> 09:06.389
I hope that I can spin
it so they don't leave.

09:06.390 --> 09:08.091
That's gonna be a hell of a spin.

09:08.092 --> 09:09.359
Not that I doubt your skills.

09:09.360 --> 09:11.327
Still got three days
left on the cease-fire.

09:11.328 --> 09:12.662
Including today.

09:12.663 --> 09:14.664
We'll work on extending
it first thing tomorrow.

09:14.665 --> 09:17.008
Look, I know you've been through
it a million times, but...

09:17.009 --> 09:18.801
Inducements for Israel
to get them to let go

09:18.802 --> 09:20.670
of the "right to exist"
language; I'm on it.

09:20.671 --> 09:22.105
What about the Ashkelon Pipeline?

09:22.106 --> 09:24.273
Maybe we could get Iran
to forgive Israel's debt?

09:24.274 --> 09:26.242
It-It's not... it's not
enough, but I'll try.

09:26.243 --> 09:28.311
You want me to reach out to
Shiraz's staff or do you want...

09:28.312 --> 09:30.055
No, no, I got it. You
got to call your wife.

09:30.056 --> 09:31.981
- Okay.
- And break plans with her again.

09:34.818 --> 09:36.986
Nothing is more important to the future

09:36.987 --> 09:39.622
of Israel than these
peace talks with Iran.

09:39.623 --> 09:43.025
If we can shake hands
with our Muslim brothers,

09:43.026 --> 09:46.429
we will show the world
that anything is possible.

09:46.430 --> 09:48.097
What do you say, Rabbi Lowenthal,

09:48.098 --> 09:49.966
to those who object to any compromise

09:49.967 --> 09:51.901
with a country who refuses
to acknowledge Israel?

09:51.902 --> 09:53.236
What are we compromising?

09:53.237 --> 09:57.573
50 years of enmity, violence,
destruction, isolation?

09:57.574 --> 10:00.942
Try to explain this to children...

10:11.154 --> 10:12.755
Yeah.

10:12.756 --> 10:15.057
Yeah.

10:15.058 --> 10:16.359
You heard?

10:16.360 --> 10:18.995
I'm on with Henry. Hear what?

10:18.996 --> 10:21.397
Rabbi Lowenthal, the guy
planning the soccer game

10:21.398 --> 10:24.333
in Jordan, he just got bombed
at a peace rally in Haifa.

10:24.334 --> 10:25.535
Tell me he survived.

10:25.536 --> 10:27.737
22 demonstrators,

10:27.738 --> 10:29.972
documentary film crew
and the rabbi... all dead.

10:29.973 --> 10:32.040
Henry, I got to call you back.

10:33.776 --> 10:36.546
Well, has anybody taken
responsibility for it?

10:36.547 --> 10:37.947
Not yet, but the bombing was

10:37.948 --> 10:39.749
close to the border with Lebanon.

10:39.750 --> 10:43.552
Hezbollah's been making
noise about the peace deal.

10:45.321 --> 10:47.256
Okay. You take Aaronson's people.

10:47.257 --> 10:48.724
I'm gonna go to Shiraz.

10:48.725 --> 10:51.160
Aaronson may be heading back
to Israel. I just got word.

10:51.161 --> 10:52.895
No. Stall him.

10:52.896 --> 10:55.530
Whoever did this is not
going to kill these talks.

10:59.635 --> 11:02.672
Iran has made so many concessions

11:02.673 --> 11:03.973
throughout these negotiations.

11:03.974 --> 11:06.209
Yes. And for that I'm very grateful.

11:06.210 --> 11:08.244
But your reversal today

11:08.245 --> 11:10.246
on acknowledging
Israel's right to exist...

11:10.247 --> 11:12.448
There's nothing to
be done in this point.

11:12.449 --> 11:13.749
It's out of my control.

11:13.750 --> 11:16.719
You have to know that I
can't ask Israel to give up

11:16.720 --> 11:19.088
its most important deal point

11:19.089 --> 11:21.824
without offering them
something in exchange.

11:21.825 --> 11:25.061
What do you ask now?

11:25.062 --> 11:26.762
Cut all ties to Hezbollah,

11:26.763 --> 11:29.465
political and financial,
effective immediately.

11:29.466 --> 11:31.200
That is outrageous.

11:31.201 --> 11:33.002
Hezbollah hasn't taken
credit for this attack.

11:33.003 --> 11:35.346
But you've already agreed to
end your support for Hezbollah

11:35.347 --> 11:36.839
as soon as the agreement is final.

11:36.840 --> 11:38.708
I'm just asking you to say so now.

11:38.709 --> 11:40.576
It's...

11:40.577 --> 11:44.847
an... an act of empathy
for a country in grief.

11:44.848 --> 11:46.883
For this concession,

11:46.884 --> 11:48.818
Israel would have to
publicly acknowledge

11:48.819 --> 11:50.486
its nuclear weapons program,

11:50.487 --> 11:53.256
- Najid.
- And submit to all the same

11:53.257 --> 11:56.125
inspections Iran must endure.

11:56.126 --> 11:58.528
Effective immediately,
or the cease-fire ends.

11:58.529 --> 12:00.696
It's impossible. It's impossible.

12:00.697 --> 12:03.599
Yet you come to me
to ask the impossible.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.368
Unripened fruit is bitter.

12:05.369 --> 12:06.903
Perhaps it's time to...

12:06.904 --> 12:11.641
to-to admit that none of us
are ready for this agreement.

12:11.642 --> 12:13.908
I'm sorry.

12:37.531 --> 12:39.800
Professor. Here to take
me to Sunday school?

12:39.801 --> 12:43.437
Well, the Covenant of John is a long way

12:43.438 --> 12:45.138
from Sunday school, but sure.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.406
I'm just messing with you.

12:46.407 --> 12:47.874
Dr. McCord went into

12:47.875 --> 12:49.926
the Covenant of John
compound in Bolivia.

12:49.927 --> 12:51.898
We're lucky to have him work with us.

12:51.899 --> 12:53.619
Did you get a chance
to look at the material

12:53.620 --> 12:54.820
I sent you this morning?

12:54.821 --> 12:55.892
Yeah, a bit.

12:55.893 --> 12:58.095
Bible's pretty crazy, man.

12:58.096 --> 12:59.930
Part of Revelation's enduring power

12:59.931 --> 13:02.065
is its intense imagery and symbolism.

13:02.066 --> 13:03.967
That's why every age has

13:03.968 --> 13:05.602
its own interpretation of it.

13:05.603 --> 13:07.237
Now, there's a strong possibility

13:07.238 --> 13:10.173
that this group's
understanding of the seven seals

13:10.174 --> 13:11.842
will include some reference

13:11.843 --> 13:14.111
to the government siege on
their compound in Bolivia,

13:14.112 --> 13:15.746
so let's start with those verses.

13:15.747 --> 13:17.447
Bring it.

13:17.448 --> 13:21.318
Okay. The opening of the
fourth seal releases what?

13:23.054 --> 13:24.521
The four horsemen...

13:24.522 --> 13:26.223
Of the Apocalypse.

13:26.224 --> 13:27.657
And the four horsemen represent?

13:27.658 --> 13:31.194
John, Paul, George and Ringo?

13:31.195 --> 13:35.465
Ian... I can't stress highly enough

13:35.466 --> 13:38.401
how important it is
that these people feel

13:38.402 --> 13:40.370
you share their beliefs.

13:40.371 --> 13:42.272
Yeah. I'll go over it. I'll be ready.

13:42.273 --> 13:44.508
You can't just read it,
you've got to know it.

13:44.509 --> 13:46.543
They will do anything for this group,

13:46.544 --> 13:48.812
leave their families, even kill,

13:48.813 --> 13:50.347
for what they think this means.

13:50.348 --> 13:52.849
This is a cult, Conroy. There's no ego.

13:52.850 --> 13:54.184
Yeah, I got it.

13:54.185 --> 13:55.768
We're just trying to protect you.

13:55.769 --> 13:57.220
If you go in there unprepared,

13:57.221 --> 14:00.623
it could cost you your life,
not to mention the operation.

14:05.257 --> 14:07.697
Ask me what it's like to come
home from your third deployment,

14:07.698 --> 14:09.933
and you can't hold down a
job 'cause you keep going off,

14:09.934 --> 14:11.517
and the only thing that makes any sense

14:11.518 --> 14:14.371
is what you used to be able
to do defending your country.

14:14.372 --> 14:17.340
I understand these people.

14:17.341 --> 14:19.342
Now, do I personally believe
the federal government

14:19.343 --> 14:21.812
is gonna declare martial
law and take every citizen's

14:21.813 --> 14:24.581
gun away from them? No.

14:24.582 --> 14:27.350
But I guarantee you that is exactly

14:27.351 --> 14:31.120
what every member of this
group will think I believe.

14:34.391 --> 14:37.227
You need to drop that
guy like a hot rock.

14:37.228 --> 14:39.262
And start over with who?

14:39.263 --> 14:41.665
Conroy already built
his contacts online.

14:41.666 --> 14:43.834
That group could have
a bomb ready to go,

14:43.835 --> 14:45.569
and we don't even know where they are.

14:45.570 --> 14:47.170
No. We're sending him in.

14:47.171 --> 14:49.573
Okay. I hear you.
Anything I can do to help.

14:49.574 --> 14:51.373
Thanks for working with him.

14:54.110 --> 14:56.446
Mr. President. Ephraim. I'm
sorry to keep you waiting.

14:56.447 --> 14:58.215
You had a few crises to manage.

15:00.117 --> 15:01.818
Hell of a thing about Rabbi Lowenthal.

15:01.819 --> 15:04.387
I read about him in
your NewsSource article.

15:04.388 --> 15:05.555
Tragic loss.

15:05.556 --> 15:08.091
So what do we know about his attackers?

15:08.092 --> 15:09.993
Haifa's proximity to the Lebanese border

15:09.994 --> 15:12.963
made Hezbollah the immediate
suspect in the bombing.

15:12.964 --> 15:15.699
But we just got word
that Israeli Intelligence

15:15.700 --> 15:17.767
has determined that the culprit

15:17.768 --> 15:19.436
was a member of the ultra-right-wing

15:19.437 --> 15:20.470
orthodox community.

15:20.471 --> 15:22.205
The attacker was Israeli?

15:22.206 --> 15:23.506
Fiercely opposed

15:23.507 --> 15:24.574
to the peace process.

15:24.575 --> 15:26.509
They have security camera footage of him

15:26.510 --> 15:29.212
placing explosives
before the demonstration.

15:29.213 --> 15:30.947
The rhetoric's been so overheated.

15:30.948 --> 15:32.682
Do they have him in custody?

15:32.683 --> 15:34.851
Not yet. Which is why
news of this hasn't broken.

15:34.852 --> 15:36.386
I think I can work with this.

15:36.387 --> 15:39.088
I'm sorry. I've got to
go try and stop a plane.

15:45.161 --> 15:46.563
Prime Minister.

15:46.564 --> 15:49.032
I'm so glad I caught you.

15:49.033 --> 15:56.106
Madam Secretary, I'm sorry we
couldn't sit down at Camp David.

15:56.107 --> 16:00.610
I wanted to express our profound
condolences for your loss.

16:00.611 --> 16:03.747
I am touched by your compassion.

16:03.748 --> 16:05.749
We hope you will bring.

16:05.750 --> 16:08.018
Rabbi Lowenthal's
assassin to swift justice.

16:08.019 --> 16:10.353
We understand he's still at large?

16:11.689 --> 16:15.024
It always impresses me the
reach of U.S. Intelligence.

16:17.060 --> 16:21.331
Well... now that we know the attack

16:21.332 --> 16:23.433
wasn't perpetrated by Hezbollah,

16:23.434 --> 16:26.870
was in fact committed by
one of your own citizens,

16:26.871 --> 16:28.571
and isn't there an opportunity

16:28.572 --> 16:31.207
for us to... to finish
these peace talks?

16:31.208 --> 16:32.909
No, no, no. Madam Secretary...

16:32.910 --> 16:34.244
N-No. Maybe not here.

16:34.245 --> 16:37.580
Then maybe when you go to
the soccer game in Jordan.

16:37.581 --> 16:39.649
What better tribute to Rabbi Lowenthal?

16:39.650 --> 16:41.584
No. We cannot continue these talks.

16:41.585 --> 16:44.621
Look, you're pushing
us too far, too fast.

16:44.622 --> 16:46.525
It's turning my countrymen
against each other...

16:46.526 --> 16:47.590
Jews killing Jews.

16:47.591 --> 16:52.996
I do, if you get on that plane
and the cease-fire expires,

16:52.997 --> 16:56.232
then everything Rabbi
Lowenthal lived for,

16:56.233 --> 16:58.234
all the progress that we have made

16:58.235 --> 17:00.503
for a better future, is gone.

17:00.504 --> 17:02.439
He will have died for nothing.

17:02.440 --> 17:04.641
If we make this deal with Iran

17:04.642 --> 17:07.277
while they still refuse to
acknowledge our right to exist,

17:07.278 --> 17:09.045
then this, too, will refute everything

17:09.046 --> 17:12.983
that Rabbi Lowenthal stood for.

17:12.983 --> 17:15.251
You see, Elizabeth,

17:15.252 --> 17:19.422
these symbols can always be
turned to suit our own purposes.

17:19.423 --> 17:22.659
My greatest purpose
is and always will be

17:22.660 --> 17:25.328
to serve my people.

17:25.329 --> 17:29.031
Thank you for your condolences.

17:41.241 --> 17:43.358
I wasn't able to stop
the prime minister.

17:43.359 --> 17:46.205
He says he left because
of the assassination,

17:46.206 --> 17:48.974
but I am beginning to think that
neither side had any intention

17:48.975 --> 17:51.009
of signing the agreement this week.

17:51.010 --> 17:52.593
For what it's worth, I got confirmation

17:52.594 --> 17:53.845
that it was the Ayatollah

17:53.846 --> 17:55.547
who objected to Israel's right to exist.

17:55.548 --> 17:57.549
At least Shiraz wasn't
hiding behind that.

17:57.550 --> 18:00.586
Are you getting anywhere
trying to work back channels?

18:00.587 --> 18:01.853
Not yet, but I found out

18:01.854 --> 18:03.597
that "Shiva" in "sitting
Shiva" means seven,

18:03.598 --> 18:04.623
so I'm trying to get Iran

18:04.624 --> 18:06.505
to extend the cease-fire
seven days while Israel

18:06.506 --> 18:08.129
mourns Rabbi Lowenthal.

18:08.130 --> 18:09.394
Okay, that's-that's good.

18:09.395 --> 18:10.996
Um, keep me posted, all right?

18:10.997 --> 18:12.564
- Thanks, Jay.
- Sorry.

18:12.565 --> 18:13.899
Hey, Mo. What's up?

18:13.900 --> 18:17.102
I passed on your concerns about
Ian Conroy to the higher-ups.

18:17.103 --> 18:19.471
They want you to be his
handler for the mission.

18:19.472 --> 18:21.695
I can only imagine what
he thinks about that.

18:21.696 --> 18:22.608
He's up for it.

18:22.609 --> 18:24.592
Doggie likes the man with
the rolled-up newspaper.

18:24.593 --> 18:25.510
No, no, no.

18:25.511 --> 18:27.045
He needs someone who believes in him,

18:27.046 --> 18:30.015
and the minute he finds out
that's not me, which he will,

18:30.016 --> 18:32.050
he is gonna flip out,

18:32.051 --> 18:33.952
and that could put the
entire mission at risk.

18:33.953 --> 18:36.088
I hear you, man. All
right, I had to ask.

18:36.089 --> 18:37.856
Okay. Listen,

18:37.857 --> 18:40.492
consulting, whatever you
need, I'm there for you, okay?

18:40.493 --> 18:42.561
Good luck. Bye.

18:44.297 --> 18:46.732
Sounds like somebody's
getting let down easy.

18:46.733 --> 18:48.575
You ready for this?

18:48.576 --> 18:52.179
Being celebrated for a
Nobel Peace Prize nomination

18:52.180 --> 18:55.249
I haven't gotten and no longer
feel I deserve in the slightest?

18:55.250 --> 18:57.651
- I am so ready.
- Come on.

18:57.652 --> 19:00.921
Madam Secretary. I'm so
honored you could come.

19:00.922 --> 19:03.457
Are you kidding? We're old Wahoos.

19:03.458 --> 19:04.858
We're thrilled to be here.

19:04.859 --> 19:06.093
I'm sorry.

19:06.094 --> 19:08.796
This is my husband Henry
McCord. Nelly Conlon.

19:08.797 --> 19:10.080
Such a pleasure to meet you.

19:10.081 --> 19:11.944
Conlon Hall is my favorite
place to hear music.

19:11.945 --> 19:14.001
You are so gracious. Call me Nelly.

19:14.002 --> 19:15.669
Do you mind if we get a quick photo?

19:15.670 --> 19:17.573
- I'm sorry to ask.
- No, not at all.

19:17.574 --> 19:19.940
I'm finally catching
up with social media.

19:19.941 --> 19:21.241
Well...

19:21.242 --> 19:22.942
Evolve or die, right?

19:24.745 --> 19:27.614
I suppose you have some
theologian's perspective

19:27.615 --> 19:31.018
on all this cultural narcissism, Henry?

19:31.019 --> 19:32.853
Well, I just think it's an expansion

19:32.854 --> 19:33.887
of self-representation.

19:33.888 --> 19:35.255
I get it.

19:35.256 --> 19:38.559
Spoken like a man who checks
his Facebook page, like, never.

19:38.560 --> 19:39.860
I have Facebook?

19:39.861 --> 19:41.962
I'm gonna get us a drink.

19:41.963 --> 19:46.834
I have to tell you, UVA has
had seven Nobel laureates.

19:46.835 --> 19:50.104
I like to think that I've
figured out a few things

19:50.105 --> 19:51.805
about how to...

19:51.806 --> 19:55.042
move the needle with the committee.

19:55.043 --> 19:56.877
I...

19:56.878 --> 19:59.780
I didn't realize that the
Nobel committee needs lobbying.

19:59.781 --> 20:02.449
I know, you think they're
all off in fjords somewhere.

20:03.518 --> 20:06.220
But with everything online,

20:06.221 --> 20:08.188
any kind of buzz matters.

20:08.189 --> 20:11.291
Like that, NewsSource cover.

20:11.292 --> 20:13.035
- That was fantastic.
- I'm-I'm not sure

20:13.036 --> 20:15.562
you want some of the
attention that's been getting.

20:15.563 --> 20:17.164
It's a historic peace deal.

20:17.165 --> 20:20.734
If some silly nonsense about your legs

20:20.735 --> 20:23.971
is what gets your message
out there, I say work it.

20:23.972 --> 20:25.239
Bosie!

20:26.374 --> 20:28.741
Is there something online about my legs?

20:30.377 --> 20:32.112
Secretary McCord,

20:32.113 --> 20:34.515
may I introduce Victor Boseman,

20:34.516 --> 20:36.717
Nobel laureate in Economics.

20:36.718 --> 20:39.421
- Cool. It's really nice to meet you.
- Madam Secretary.

20:39.422 --> 20:40.120
Dr. McCord.

20:40.121 --> 20:41.855
Sorry, I'm geeking out a little.

20:41.856 --> 20:43.439
Well, Elizabeth was a math major,

20:43.440 --> 20:44.658
so I'm sure

20:44.659 --> 20:46.593
the geeking is mutual.

20:46.594 --> 20:48.362
What's your theory? I mean, can I ask?

20:48.363 --> 20:51.732
Broadly speaking, it concerns
contract negotiations.

20:51.733 --> 20:54.001
Thank goodness we moved
on from macroeconomics.

20:54.002 --> 20:55.135
I could never

20:55.136 --> 20:56.804
explain that to anybody.

20:56.805 --> 20:58.839
Basically it's a statistical analysis

20:58.840 --> 21:00.574
of optimal contractual arrangements,

21:00.575 --> 21:02.175
building on Hart and Holmstrom's theory.

21:03.511 --> 21:05.879
The idea is to find out if
there's a quantifiable balance

21:05.880 --> 21:08.081
of interdependence that
engages the goodwill

21:08.082 --> 21:10.551
of both parties; And
it turns out there is.

21:10.552 --> 21:11.952
See?

21:11.953 --> 21:14.555
Maybe the whole peace deal
is easier than you think.

21:14.556 --> 21:16.657
Of course, it sounds reductive,

21:16.658 --> 21:19.393
but it-it really does
come down to both parties

21:19.394 --> 21:21.728
having some baseline of
mutual interdependence

21:21.729 --> 21:23.096
with a few very simple,

21:23.097 --> 21:24.898
very clear incentives.

21:24.899 --> 21:27.267
Is that all?

21:29.404 --> 21:31.438
Gee, Mr. Math.

21:31.439 --> 21:35.275
Silly me, if I'd only just
plugged Iran and Israel

21:35.276 --> 21:37.444
into the right equation, then, well,

21:37.445 --> 21:40.780
they could have been tangoing weeks ago.

21:43.318 --> 21:45.686
Well, to be fair, I don't think

21:45.687 --> 21:46.653
he was implying...

21:46.654 --> 21:48.722
Is any of this really fair, though?

21:48.723 --> 21:53.794
I mean, Iran yanking the most
important piece of a peace deal

21:53.795 --> 21:56.864
hours before we head into
our final negotiations.

21:56.865 --> 21:58.999
I mean, is that really fair?

21:59.000 --> 22:00.367
Definitely not.

22:00.368 --> 22:03.670
Some misguided lunatic

22:03.671 --> 22:06.440
throwing a bomb at a rabbi
he doesn't agree with,

22:06.441 --> 22:09.276
and then 25 other innocent people

22:09.277 --> 22:12.045
get killed along with him.

22:12.046 --> 22:14.081
Is that fair?

22:14.082 --> 22:19.086
But, hey, if I show
just a little more leg,

22:19.087 --> 22:21.021
maybe UVA will get another Nobel Prize.

22:21.022 --> 22:21.989
Hey, kids.

22:21.990 --> 22:23.323
You guys are back early.

22:23.324 --> 22:24.690
Possibly drunk.

22:25.592 --> 22:27.694
Well, it's been a stressful week.

22:27.695 --> 22:30.063
Well, you looked smoking
hot on your magazine cover.

22:30.064 --> 22:31.465
My God, do you see that?

22:31.466 --> 22:34.401
I mean, even in my own house,
I am appraised like a show pony.

22:34.402 --> 22:35.335
Okay.

22:35.336 --> 22:36.637
All I said was you looked hot.

22:36.638 --> 22:38.171
Alison, it's not a reality show!

22:38.172 --> 22:39.740
Fine. Forget I said anything.

22:41.376 --> 22:44.044
I'm gonna assume this is

22:44.045 --> 22:46.346
somehow different than when
Dad was called "arm candy"

22:46.347 --> 22:49.982
by a magazine, and everybody
was just okay with that.

23:03.597 --> 23:05.865
Yeah, it's different.

23:12.606 --> 23:14.308
Hey. How's Ali?

23:15.677 --> 23:19.413
She's still freezing me out.

23:19.414 --> 23:21.281
I shouldn't have snapped.

23:21.282 --> 23:23.582
Give yourself a break.

23:24.751 --> 23:28.454
I feel like a failure on every level.

23:30.357 --> 23:33.727
You do realize that just getting
the Israelis and the Iranians

23:33.728 --> 23:37.164
to engage in six weeks
of talks alone is enough

23:37.165 --> 23:38.732
to get you a Peace Prize?

23:38.733 --> 23:41.301
I so don't care about
that prize right now.

23:41.302 --> 23:44.037
Well, whether you care about it or not,

23:44.038 --> 23:45.221
it's honoring something real.

23:45.222 --> 23:47.774
Yeah. I just keep
thinking about something

23:47.775 --> 23:49.943
that Aaronson said when he was leaving.

23:49.944 --> 23:54.648
He said that Rabbi
Lowenthal's death was...

23:54.649 --> 23:57.484
just a symbol that we could all use

23:57.485 --> 23:59.786
for our own political purposes.

23:59.787 --> 24:02.621
It just...

24:04.057 --> 24:08.195
made it all seem so... empty.

24:08.196 --> 24:10.097
Well, you're not gonna get very far

24:10.098 --> 24:13.133
trying to debunk the power
of symbols with a theologian.

24:14.402 --> 24:17.604
I spent the whole
afternoon trying to explain

24:17.605 --> 24:20.474
to this boneheaded ATF agent why someone

24:20.475 --> 24:22.576
would be willing to give up their life

24:22.577 --> 24:25.312
for something that was
scratched out on papyrus

24:25.313 --> 24:26.747
thousands of years ago.

24:26.748 --> 24:28.749
How'd that go?

24:28.750 --> 24:31.485
Well, I did my part.

24:31.486 --> 24:33.419
Rest is up to them.

24:37.958 --> 24:40.327
It's getting hard to compartmentalize.

24:40.328 --> 24:42.628
You notice that?

24:43.764 --> 24:45.532
I can compartmentalize just fine.

24:45.533 --> 24:48.434
What about you there, Madam Sexy-tary?

24:50.170 --> 24:52.539
Okay, I knew that was a risk.

24:52.540 --> 24:55.207
I just had... Never mind.

25:04.652 --> 25:06.253
Wait. Hang on.

25:06.254 --> 25:09.289
Before you say anything,
tell me you slept.

25:09.290 --> 25:11.224
There was about a half hour in there.

25:11.225 --> 25:14.461
I'd love to negotiate
peace in the same time zone.

25:14.462 --> 25:16.763
Where are we with the cease-fire?

25:16.764 --> 25:18.398
Rabbi Lowenthal's assassination

25:18.399 --> 25:20.233
pretty much shut everything down,

25:20.234 --> 25:22.869
but we've got until tomorrow.

25:22.870 --> 25:25.038
All right, I'm gonna take it from here.

25:25.039 --> 25:27.274
Why don't you try and
get some sleep, okay?

25:27.275 --> 25:28.898
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Morning.

25:28.899 --> 25:31.211
I'm sorry to have to bring
you a bit of bad news.

25:31.212 --> 25:33.713
Well, that never stops anybody, does it?

25:33.714 --> 25:36.783
Well, due to security concerns,

25:36.784 --> 25:40.020
Jordan has decided to
cancel the Iranian/Israeli

25:40.021 --> 25:42.856
youth soccer game that was
organized by Rabbi Lowenthal.

25:42.857 --> 25:44.524
They didn't do that already?

25:44.525 --> 25:47.961
Well, the kids still wanted to
play, in tribute to the rabbi.

25:47.962 --> 25:49.362
But understandably,

25:49.363 --> 25:51.565
Jordan can't take on the
risk of another attack.

25:51.566 --> 25:52.966
Talks are all but dead.

25:52.967 --> 25:55.234
It wouldn't have mattered much anyway.

25:56.603 --> 25:57.804
Sorry.

25:57.805 --> 25:59.372
Yeah, I'm gonna go lie down.

25:59.373 --> 26:02.008
No, no, no, no, hang on.

26:02.009 --> 26:06.179
This might be exactly
the symbol we need.

26:06.180 --> 26:08.815
Can we get the teams here?

26:08.816 --> 26:10.550
Here, where?

26:10.551 --> 26:13.253
D.C. by tomorrow, before
the cease-fire expires?

26:13.254 --> 26:14.917
I mean, we're the
State Department, right?

26:14.918 --> 26:16.056
We can do that?

26:16.057 --> 26:17.524
Well, it might be challenging.

26:17.525 --> 26:19.659
Trying to get two countries

26:19.660 --> 26:21.695
not to go to war with each other.

26:21.696 --> 26:23.463
That is challenging.

26:23.464 --> 26:27.000
Okay, I don't know
about the rest of you,

26:27.001 --> 26:28.502
but after all of the work

26:28.503 --> 26:30.270
that we have put into this peace deal,

26:30.271 --> 26:33.273
I would like to see one
good thing come out of it.

26:33.274 --> 26:35.175
Who's with me?

26:35.176 --> 26:37.377
With you as ever, ma'am.

26:37.378 --> 26:40.981
Yes! Let's bring the
soccer game to D.C.!

26:49.184 --> 26:51.599
We've cleared visas for
all the soccer players,

26:51.600 --> 26:53.735
plus one family member
each, and the coaches.

26:53.736 --> 26:56.702
Great. I assume we have
Valerie to thank for that.

26:56.703 --> 26:59.104
I'm singing at her nephew's
birthday party next month.

26:59.105 --> 27:00.063
Way to work it.

27:00.064 --> 27:01.631
Doing it for shalom.

27:01.632 --> 27:03.567
Okay, I've got the Chronicle

27:03.568 --> 27:05.111
and the Times fighting over a feature.

27:05.112 --> 27:06.209
Who did we want to go with?

27:06.210 --> 27:08.538
- The Chronicle.
- The Times.

27:08.539 --> 27:10.373
Okay, the National.

27:10.374 --> 27:12.976
Park Service can provide
a decent-sized soccer field

27:12.977 --> 27:15.145
in Meridian Hill, but
they're kind of killing us

27:15.146 --> 27:16.613
on the last-minute permit fees.

27:16.614 --> 27:17.714
We'll pay it.

27:17.715 --> 27:18.880
Well...

27:18.881 --> 27:21.362
Jay's wife is calling. She says
she's been trying to reach him.

27:21.363 --> 27:22.906
Would someone wake up Jay, please.

27:22.907 --> 27:24.521
Don't. Let him sleep.

27:24.522 --> 27:26.256
He looked like a zombie.

27:26.257 --> 27:28.000
All right, where are
we with transportation?

27:28.001 --> 27:31.695
Unfortunately, the
entire fleet is booked.

27:31.696 --> 27:33.230
Well, let me look into commercial.

27:33.231 --> 27:34.931
Well, there's a larger issue.

27:34.932 --> 27:37.300
Ma'am, we don't have a budget for this.

27:37.301 --> 27:40.337
And I'm not seeing enough to
divert from any other line item

27:40.338 --> 27:41.738
to cover all of these expenses.

27:41.739 --> 27:44.074
Keep trying.

27:44.075 --> 27:46.343
I'm not letting this
get derailed by red tape.

27:46.344 --> 27:48.445
I have a connection down
in Budget and Planning.

27:48.446 --> 27:50.614
Let me see if I can shake
loose some travel funding.

27:50.615 --> 27:51.918
Yeah, I have an angle

27:51.919 --> 27:53.917
I can try for a stadium.

27:53.918 --> 27:56.887
All right, stay with it, everyone.

27:56.888 --> 27:58.554
Yes, ma'am.

28:00.924 --> 28:03.393
Wow. Are you the coffee fairy?

28:03.394 --> 28:04.528
That depends.

28:04.529 --> 28:07.062
Have you been a good little bureaucrat?

28:08.832 --> 28:11.468
This is an unexpected treat.

28:11.469 --> 28:14.471
What can I do for you, Madam Secretary?

28:14.472 --> 28:16.773
Well, I was thinking about your whole.

28:16.774 --> 28:21.645
Nobel strategy, and I want
to run something by you.

28:21.646 --> 28:23.046
I always thought diplomacy

28:23.047 --> 28:24.414
is a lot like surfing.

28:24.415 --> 28:26.183
You think you're getting a sweet set,

28:26.184 --> 28:28.218
and the next thing you
know, you're being worked

28:28.219 --> 28:30.053
on some reef you didn't
even know was there.

28:30.054 --> 28:31.788
That's why you got
to talk to the locals.

28:31.789 --> 28:33.156
ELIZABETH And then it hit me.

28:33.157 --> 28:37.894
Maybe we can't save this
peace deal right now,

28:37.895 --> 28:41.031
but what if we could
save this soccer game?

28:41.032 --> 28:43.500
I'm listening.

28:43.501 --> 28:46.002
My point, Kevin, is that
sometimes we need to respond

28:46.003 --> 28:48.104
to an immediate situation, like, say,

28:48.105 --> 28:50.373
making a last-ditch effort
to save a peace deal.

28:50.374 --> 28:52.842
And little things like budgets

28:52.843 --> 28:55.178
don't always allow for
that kind of flexibility.

28:55.179 --> 28:57.681
Bringing the future of
these two countries together

28:57.682 --> 29:00.517
in the land of the free,
home of the brave...

29:00.518 --> 29:03.053
a living demonstration

29:03.054 --> 29:08.658
of Rabbi Lowenthal's
lifelong commitment to peace.

29:08.659 --> 29:11.228
Maybe if you'd come to me at the
beginning of the fiscal quarter

29:11.229 --> 29:13.063
with an R-241 signed by all parties,

29:13.064 --> 29:14.931
I might have been able to help.

29:14.932 --> 29:16.233
But there's no way.

29:16.234 --> 29:17.667
There's, like, literally no way.

29:17.668 --> 29:18.931
Could you stop saying "no way"?

29:18.932 --> 29:21.404
I'm sorry. This is the government, man.

29:21.405 --> 29:26.376
Max, how would you like to help
bring peace to the Middle East?

29:26.377 --> 29:28.178
Budget and Planning

29:28.179 --> 29:29.446
was a complete wipeout.

29:29.447 --> 29:31.414
Dude's probably not even a real surfer.

29:31.415 --> 29:35.652
Okay, who is ready for some soccer?!

29:35.653 --> 29:37.387
Nelly Conlon just happened

29:37.388 --> 29:39.623
to find a spare stadium
near Charlottesville.

29:39.624 --> 29:40.790
- Yes!
- Yes!

29:40.791 --> 29:42.292
Yeah!

29:42.293 --> 29:43.260
It's okay.

29:43.261 --> 29:44.794
Ma'am, I am very sorry, but we are

29:44.795 --> 29:46.796
hung up on travel expenses.

29:48.099 --> 29:49.966
She also happened to
mention a slush fund.

29:49.967 --> 29:51.601
I'm just gonna go make a phone call.

29:51.602 --> 29:53.136
Nelly Conlon taking it to the net.

29:53.137 --> 29:54.771
Don't know if you got my e-mail.

29:54.772 --> 29:56.715
Israel released the
identity of the Haifa bomber.

29:56.716 --> 30:00.110
Yeah, I-I did, which brings
us to our next mission.

30:00.111 --> 30:02.979
Blake, I need you to
contact President Shiraz,

30:02.980 --> 30:04.914
and then after that,
Prime Minister Aaronson.

30:04.915 --> 30:06.698
I want them both at
that game tomorrow, okay?

30:06.699 --> 30:09.886
And-and if we can't
extend the cease-fire?

30:09.887 --> 30:13.290
Well, then they will be seated

30:13.291 --> 30:15.225
across from each other at a stadium

30:15.226 --> 30:17.861
watching their kids play soccer.

30:17.862 --> 30:20.196
Let's see them launch missiles
at each other after that.

30:20.197 --> 30:23.733
And who knows, might even
get those talks going again.

30:23.734 --> 30:26.135
- Okay.
- On it.

30:40.150 --> 30:42.185
Ian?

30:42.186 --> 30:45.322
I came to see you, Dr. McCord,
but they wouldn't let me in.

30:45.323 --> 30:48.291
Well, you know how to reach
me. You should have called.

30:48.292 --> 30:51.528
I just wanted to let
you know that I know now.

30:51.529 --> 30:55.665
I was deceived by my arrogance before.

30:55.666 --> 30:58.000
Now I see.

30:58.802 --> 31:00.737
Well, that's good.

31:00.738 --> 31:02.138
Why don't we go inside?

31:02.139 --> 31:03.206
No, Henry.

31:03.207 --> 31:05.675
I just wanted you to know that I know.

31:05.676 --> 31:08.744
What is it you know?

31:12.015 --> 31:15.151
I know who shall be redeemed

31:15.152 --> 31:17.420
and who shall suffer eternal damnation.

31:17.421 --> 31:22.258
"The four living creatures,
each of them with six wings,

31:22.259 --> 31:25.595
"were covered with eyes inside and out.

31:25.596 --> 31:28.631
"Day and night, they
do not stop exclaiming.

31:28.632 --> 31:30.800
"Holy, holy, holy

31:30.801 --> 31:34.070
"is the Lord God Almighty,

31:34.071 --> 31:39.608
who is, who was, and
who is yet to come."

31:54.057 --> 31:56.558
It's empty. Go ahead and check.

32:06.836 --> 32:09.171
You did a little studying. Bravo.

32:10.940 --> 32:13.209
I can make them believe.

32:13.210 --> 32:14.911
But I need your help.

32:14.912 --> 32:17.781
You've been inside the wire.

32:17.782 --> 32:19.449
You know.

32:19.450 --> 32:21.650
Will you help me?

32:36.216 --> 32:38.203
David Ackerman from The
Chronicle is here, ma'am.

32:38.204 --> 32:40.205
- He brought a photographer.
- Great.

32:40.206 --> 32:42.474
Let's make sure and get
a shot with Nelly Conlon.

32:42.475 --> 32:45.009
We owe her big for this.

32:45.010 --> 32:46.978
Blake, what about POTUS?

32:46.979 --> 32:49.514
He hopes to make
it here for the kickoff,

32:49.515 --> 32:50.982
but it's unconfirmed.

32:50.983 --> 32:53.518
Here comes Israeli
Prime Minister Aaronson.

32:53.519 --> 32:57.055
And President Shiraz
should be here momentarily.

32:57.056 --> 32:58.623
All right.

32:58.624 --> 33:00.225
Let's just hope

33:00.226 --> 33:03.962
this doesn't somehow
backfire and derail whatever

33:03.963 --> 33:06.296
tenuous peace we had left.

33:07.398 --> 33:09.133
Peanuts?

33:09.134 --> 33:11.102
Representing their home countries

33:11.103 --> 33:12.337
in the spirit of peace,

33:12.338 --> 33:14.839
please welcome our team from Iran.

33:23.081 --> 33:25.149
And our team from Israel.

33:34.125 --> 33:38.263
And now, in honor of
Rabbi Lowenthal, we begin.

33:56.314 --> 33:58.349
How's it looking, Blake?

34:00.152 --> 34:02.720
Well, the prime minister
appears... supportive

34:02.721 --> 34:04.489
and engaged, ma'am.

34:04.490 --> 34:06.790
What about Shiraz?

34:07.892 --> 34:09.427
Enjoying...

34:09.428 --> 34:11.629
peanuts and soda.

34:11.630 --> 34:14.065
Well, tell him if he makes the deal

34:14.065 --> 34:15.500
and the sanctions stay lifted,

34:15.501 --> 34:18.402
he could have all the
pop and peanuts he wants.

34:19.603 --> 34:21.838
That's a good thought.

34:23.875 --> 34:26.811
Blake, get-get me my phone, will you?

34:40.358 --> 34:43.061
Nothing about Israel's right to exist?

34:43.062 --> 34:46.097
Nope. We're back to the terms
of the original agreement:

34:46.098 --> 34:48.866
No acknowledging Israel, no
severing ties with Hezbollah,

34:48.867 --> 34:50.668
no pulling Quds Forces
in other countries...

34:50.668 --> 34:52.235
you can have it all.

34:52.237 --> 34:53.737
We just want a cease-fire.

34:53.739 --> 34:55.873
But you're adding another
five years to the agreement?

34:55.873 --> 34:58.176
Yes. Because we have to
give Israel something.

34:58.177 --> 35:00.078
While they submit to zero inspections

35:00.079 --> 35:02.113
because they still won't
acknowledge they have

35:02.114 --> 35:03.880
a nuclear weapons program.

35:07.219 --> 35:08.753
You know what this is?

35:08.754 --> 35:11.055
This is the most I've
seen of my daughter

35:11.056 --> 35:13.824
in the last seven
weeks. I mean, she's two.

35:15.593 --> 35:16.961
We all miss our family.

35:16.962 --> 35:18.997
Then make the deal happen.

35:18.998 --> 35:21.065
It's exactly what your
leaders already agreed to,

35:21.066 --> 35:22.900
with five more years of inspections.

35:22.901 --> 35:25.371
It opens up your economy, it puts Iran

35:25.372 --> 35:26.919
in a newly empowered
position in the Middle East,

35:26.920 --> 35:28.596
and it gets you back in business

35:28.597 --> 35:30.140
with the EU and the rest of the world.

35:30.141 --> 35:34.295
So go sell this to your
boss, and let's all go home.

35:43.209 --> 35:45.050
- Come on, drive it!
- Come on, red, set it up!

35:45.051 --> 35:48.676
Come on... How do we decide
which team we're rooting for?

35:48.677 --> 35:51.104
Iran is willing to totally
revert back to the original deal

35:51.105 --> 35:53.339
plus five more years of IAEA inspections

35:53.340 --> 35:55.909
if Israel will agree to
preserve a cease-fire.

35:55.910 --> 35:58.778
So we give up everything
we negotiated for?

35:58.779 --> 36:00.446
How is this progress?

36:00.447 --> 36:03.049
Because it's the same deal
we had in place before,

36:03.050 --> 36:05.285
only now Israel's part of it.

36:05.286 --> 36:07.253
Iran just wants one more thing.

36:07.254 --> 36:09.022
- What's that?
- Ashkelon pipeline.

36:09.023 --> 36:11.024
Israel pays the
outstanding fines it owes.

36:11.025 --> 36:12.425
No. I can't sell that.

36:12.426 --> 36:14.294
Then tell your leaders
all they have to do

36:14.295 --> 36:15.951
is say they'll pay,
give a first installment

36:15.952 --> 36:18.153
and negotiate the rest later.
And one other thing...

36:18.154 --> 36:19.737
you're gonna sell some oranges to Iran.

36:19.738 --> 36:21.034
- Oranges?
- Yeah.

36:21.035 --> 36:22.969
Jaffa oranges. Doesn't matter how much.

36:22.970 --> 36:25.772
And Iran's gonna sell
you some pistachios.

36:25.773 --> 36:27.740
I hear they're really good.

36:27.741 --> 36:29.342
I don't get it.

36:29.343 --> 36:31.411
It's a symbol.

36:31.412 --> 36:33.112
Okay?

36:33.113 --> 36:35.982
Sometimes that's...

36:35.983 --> 36:38.650
all it takes.

36:46.560 --> 36:47.993
Yeah!

36:51.431 --> 36:53.132
Wait, wait, how do we tell we won?

36:53.133 --> 36:55.267
- Did we win?
- I don't know. I don't know.

37:00.540 --> 37:03.275
Hey. Look at that, you guys.

37:07.814 --> 37:10.516
Look what's happening.

37:10.517 --> 37:13.351
Ma'am. We may have tears.

37:27.033 --> 37:29.068
That should bode well for Jay.

37:29.069 --> 37:30.503
Where is he?

37:30.504 --> 37:31.938
Yeah, he had something

37:31.939 --> 37:34.540
he had to attend to.

37:42.048 --> 37:43.583
You made it.

37:43.584 --> 37:45.118
Yes, I did.

37:45.119 --> 37:47.086
I take it things went well.

37:47.087 --> 37:49.520
Well, Iran and Israel won't
be firing at each other

37:49.521 --> 37:50.857
anytime soon.

37:50.858 --> 37:52.892
That's amazing. Congratulations.

37:52.893 --> 37:54.427
Awesome. Thank you.

37:54.428 --> 37:56.529
We'll see how their
next round of talks goes,

37:56.530 --> 37:59.265
but we stuck our finger
in the dike anyway.

37:59.266 --> 38:00.867
How about you?

38:00.868 --> 38:02.668
Well, let's see.

38:02.669 --> 38:05.304
I reorganized a toy bin
and got into an argument

38:05.305 --> 38:06.806
with my mother about day care.

38:06.807 --> 38:08.640
What's her problem with day care?

38:09.409 --> 38:11.310
Who knows? She read an article.

38:14.113 --> 38:16.248
What's up?

38:18.718 --> 38:20.486
I miss my life.

38:20.487 --> 38:22.221
Hey, you'll be back to work soon.

38:22.222 --> 38:25.925
It's not just work,
Jay, it's everything.

38:25.926 --> 38:28.861
We are not a family anymore.

38:28.862 --> 38:31.998
I need more than one meal a month,

38:31.999 --> 38:34.233
that has to be rescheduled
three times over

38:34.234 --> 38:35.435
before it even happens.

38:35.436 --> 38:37.070
I know it's been an intense time,

38:37.071 --> 38:39.072
but this is a... temporary condition.

38:39.073 --> 38:40.856
You-you have to keep
in mind the specifics...

38:40.857 --> 38:43.142
No. Don't negotiate with me.

38:43.143 --> 38:45.478
This isn't a deal.

38:45.479 --> 38:47.246
You have, um...

38:47.247 --> 38:51.017
an incredible, world-altering job,

38:51.018 --> 38:54.487
and I would never...
ask you to give that up.

38:54.488 --> 38:56.956
But I just...

38:56.957 --> 38:59.591
don't know if that's what I wanted.

39:01.027 --> 39:02.295
Abby, come on...

39:02.296 --> 39:04.030
I'm not saying anything definitive.

39:04.031 --> 39:06.332
I just...

39:07.434 --> 39:10.068
I just need some time apart.

39:11.804 --> 39:14.539
Some time to think.

39:16.142 --> 39:18.577
What are you saying?

39:28.588 --> 39:30.323
Hey. She still on with Aaronson?

39:30.324 --> 39:32.859
Just getting final word.
Looks like it's a go.

39:32.860 --> 39:34.227
Are we good? Are we here?

39:34.228 --> 39:35.595
She's just getting final word.

39:35.596 --> 39:38.597
All right. Wrapping up the call.

39:39.265 --> 39:41.967
Niceties and pleasantries, and...

39:43.302 --> 39:44.403
we're approved.

39:44.404 --> 39:45.738
Yes.

39:47.274 --> 39:48.407
Yes.

39:48.408 --> 39:50.243
Cease-fire back in place.

39:50.244 --> 39:51.677
And Saint Jay

39:51.678 --> 39:53.679
got us a whole new agreement going.

39:53.680 --> 39:54.881
Congratulations, ma'am.

39:55.432 --> 39:56.993
And what's with pistachios and oranges?

39:56.994 --> 39:59.017
I'm definitely gonna get
some questions about that.

39:59.018 --> 40:01.053
Well, just a little...

40:01.054 --> 40:02.989
mutual interdependence thing...

40:02.990 --> 40:05.791
that I got from a Nobel
laureate economist.

40:05.792 --> 40:07.126
Okay.

40:07.127 --> 40:08.427
Grab your mugs, people.

40:08.428 --> 40:10.329
I'm gonna go get some glasses.

40:10.330 --> 40:11.864
- Gentlemen's breakfast.
- Hey, man.

40:12.490 --> 40:14.267
I was wondering,
would it be all right

40:14.268 --> 40:16.802
if I crashed at your
place for a few nights?

40:16.803 --> 40:18.971
Yeah. Course.

40:18.972 --> 40:21.174
Is everything all right?

40:21.175 --> 40:23.541
Yeah.

40:26.779 --> 40:28.314
Hey there.

40:28.315 --> 40:29.949
Hi.

40:29.950 --> 40:31.584
Can't keep me away.

40:31.585 --> 40:33.152
That's true.

40:33.153 --> 40:35.454
But I can charge you for the coffee.

40:35.455 --> 40:38.324
Five dollars. You can
leave it by the pot.

40:38.325 --> 40:41.194
But if you get that requisition
form in for next fiscal quarter,

40:41.195 --> 40:43.461
I may be able to cut you a deal.

40:49.168 --> 40:50.670
Wasn't in the mood anyway.

40:52.172 --> 40:53.773
What do you say to a drink?

40:53.774 --> 40:55.345
You think I'm gonna
have a drink with you?

40:55.346 --> 40:57.068
Well, it looks like
you're already starting.

40:57.069 --> 40:58.470
We're celebrating a peace deal.

40:58.471 --> 40:59.979
Iran and Israel. Congrats.

40:59.980 --> 41:01.180
That's what we do.

41:01.181 --> 41:03.416
Pull off world peace
despite zero support

41:03.417 --> 41:05.885
from small-minded
bureaucrats with no vision.

41:05.886 --> 41:08.687
Yeah. So tonight?

41:11.057 --> 41:13.591
Just... text me when you're done.

41:23.636 --> 41:24.670
Sorry.

41:24.671 --> 41:26.472
No, no. Stay, stay.

41:26.473 --> 41:28.074
Is that my face cream?

41:28.075 --> 41:30.910
I only used a little. I
like the way it smells.

41:30.911 --> 41:33.846
Well, it better smell
good; It costs a fortune.

41:33.847 --> 41:36.215
Supposedly, it has
pearls in it or something.

41:37.417 --> 41:39.151
You really don't need that.

41:39.152 --> 41:40.720
Your skin is flawless.

41:40.721 --> 41:43.556
No way. I'm having
the worst breakout.

41:43.557 --> 41:45.123
Where?

41:47.727 --> 41:50.029
Nobody can see that

41:50.030 --> 41:51.264
but you.

41:53.699 --> 41:55.835
I'm sorry I said the wrong thing

41:55.836 --> 41:57.136
about your magazine cover.

41:57.137 --> 41:58.638
Baby, you didn't say the wrong thing;

41:58.639 --> 41:59.905
It was everybody else.

41:59.906 --> 42:02.541
I mean...

42:02.542 --> 42:04.043
I just...

42:04.044 --> 42:08.581
I... I want people to talk
about what I'm trying to do,

42:08.582 --> 42:11.484
not about how I look doing it.

42:11.485 --> 42:12.752
You know?

42:12.753 --> 42:14.186
That must suck.

42:14.187 --> 42:17.823
Yeah, it... sucks for everybody.

42:17.824 --> 42:20.026
I mean...

42:20.027 --> 42:22.895
it's fun to feel pretty.

42:22.896 --> 42:26.365
But when that's the only
thing the world is looking for,
