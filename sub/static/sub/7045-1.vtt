WEBVTT

00:34.880 --> 00:36.159
We're always trying

00:36.320 --> 00:37.119
new things.

00:40.840 --> 00:41.959
We are so used

00:42.160 --> 00:43.839
to having crappy products.

02:15.680 --> 02:18.679
Daft Punk thought about
their music before they made it.

02:19.360 --> 02:22.919
That makes a real difference.
And weirdly enough,

02:23.200 --> 02:26.279
creating those robot personas
let them stay human,

02:26.480 --> 02:29.079
grounded and completely free.

02:32.200 --> 02:35.079
They bought their freedom
by sending the robots

02:35.320 --> 02:36.479
to do their dirty work.

03:55.320 --> 03:59.199
They were proud to release an EP
on the same label as Stereolab.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.039
That's how it all started.

04:02.240 --> 04:06.679
Guy-Manuel and Thomas
were 17 or 18 back then.

04:06.920 --> 04:09.759
They thought everything
had been set in motion.

04:11.400 --> 04:16.279
But a critic from Melody Maker
called them "daft punky thrash".

04:17.560 --> 04:20.839
That made them stop and wonder.

04:22.840 --> 04:27.239
It changed the optimistic view
they had on their music.

04:30.480 --> 04:35.039
It took them six or seven months
to send me two other tracks.

04:35.640 --> 04:38.959
I think they just
did not want to go that way.

04:39.760 --> 04:44.759
They would say "you'll have
the new tracks next week",

04:44.920 --> 04:48.319
but what they really meant was
"we don't care.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.679
We have
other things to think about."

05:16.600 --> 05:20.079
We were 18
when we went to our first rave

05:20.280 --> 05:21.759
on the roof of Beaubourg.

05:25.160 --> 05:29.439
We discovered a new kind
of music and energy

05:29.680 --> 05:32.439
with people dancing to music
they had never heard before.

05:32.640 --> 05:35.839
Something new
was happening on that scene

05:36.040 --> 05:42.519
and it was still alternative
and underground at the time.

05:42.720 --> 05:46.079
Not the kind of music
you heard on the radio.

05:51.160 --> 05:53.879
We thought there was
something to be done

05:54.120 --> 05:56.279
with electronic music.

05:58.240 --> 06:01.879
Thomas,
Guy-Manuel and I met there

06:02.120 --> 06:06.919
and the closer we got, the more
we could feel the vibrations.

06:07.200 --> 06:11.399
There's a track from Chicago
with a dark voice

06:22.520 --> 06:27.039
It was the last major revolution
in recent decades.

06:27.520 --> 06:31.239
Electronic music and hip-hop
were the last great revolutions.

06:31.440 --> 06:34.879
Everything since then
ultimately comes from

06:35.120 --> 06:36.679
one of those two movements.

07:11.080 --> 07:14.119
There were people
discovering drugs as well.

07:15.640 --> 07:19.319
I remember Thomas saying
he did not like it

07:19.520 --> 07:21.799
because using ecstasy made you

07:22.040 --> 07:24.039
lose your critical faculties.

07:25.360 --> 07:27.359
And that was it.

07:27.960 --> 07:30.959
He hates nothing more
than losing control.

08:10.160 --> 08:13.079
I called and asked them to come

08:13.280 --> 08:15.399
and to bring their demo.

08:20.440 --> 08:21.999
When they arrived,

08:22.200 --> 08:26.799
they were wondering
what was going on.

08:28.920 --> 08:32.799
They come in, their eyes
wide open. Guy-Man is blushing.

08:33.159 --> 08:36.359
I introduce
the people from Slam.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.279
We didn't have a name.

09:15.600 --> 09:18.759
We decided to use
the name from that bad review.

09:19.120 --> 09:21.679
They called us "daft punk".

09:28.320 --> 09:31.599
They have a very clear vision
of their careers

09:31.840 --> 09:34.959
because they get advice from
Thomas's Bangalter father.

09:35.200 --> 09:39.079
He produced disco music in the 70s
under the name Daniel Vangarde.

09:39.800 --> 09:44.679
He helped them work out
the deals they were offered.

09:46.400 --> 09:50.359
He was the ideal advisor
for a band

09:50.600 --> 09:53.319
making dance music
produced in France

09:53.520 --> 09:56.279
with lyrics in English
and aimed at the whole world.

09:59.680 --> 10:00.839
We've received faxes

10:01.080 --> 10:02.319
from Denmark, Sweden,

10:02.560 --> 10:04.999
Spain, Japan, New York...

10:05.240 --> 10:08.399
although
we've only sold 15,000 records.

10:08.680 --> 10:12.399
It shows
that there is an audience

10:12.640 --> 10:16.759
for that kind of music
all around the world.

11:50.480 --> 11:52.439
When I met them
in 1995,

11:52.680 --> 11:57.239
between the Scottish label,
and their energy and talent,

11:57.720 --> 12:00.519
Daft Punk were already
in demand

12:00.720 --> 12:02.399
for a live set.

12:09.240 --> 12:13.119
I would say that they were
recording their first album

12:13.360 --> 12:15.879
and a live set
wasn't possible yet.

12:18.720 --> 12:21.479
Technically, it was stunning.

12:22.520 --> 12:25.359
That music
was made in a bedroom...

12:26.360 --> 12:27.319
this big.

12:27.560 --> 12:32.359
There were electric cords
all over this child's bedroom.

12:32.760 --> 12:34.239
Child's. Not teenager's.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.919
It was full of cables,
keyboards and stuff.

12:38.360 --> 12:42.679
The two albums which changed the face
of electronic music were made there.

15:15.440 --> 15:18.599
The specificity of our music
and our work is that

15:18.800 --> 15:22.279
there is a real interaction
between music and technology.

15:22.480 --> 15:27.679
In a way, we consider technology
to be a part of the band.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.119
Thomas
is a genius with machines.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.919
When he was working on
their debut album,

15:46.200 --> 15:49.239
he read his instruction manuals
once a month.

15:50.880 --> 15:53.119
He was one of the first
to have a Macintosh in France

15:53.400 --> 15:56.559
so he had a very early approach
to computer-aided

15:56.840 --> 15:58.599
music and images.

16:00.520 --> 16:03.199
But artistically
there's more to him than that.

16:03.480 --> 16:07.679
He creates wonderful melodies.

16:07.880 --> 16:12.159
He has a real feeling
for what makes a hit.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.159
Guy-Man is the mystical one.

16:17.400 --> 16:20.119
There's just one thing
that works for him

16:20.520 --> 16:24.079
and as long as he hasn't
found it, the rest is junk.

17:40.120 --> 17:44.999
The contract we signed with
the label is 100% good for us

17:45.480 --> 17:49.279
so we've avoided problems
that others artists have had

17:49.520 --> 17:51.399
with their record companies.

17:55.320 --> 17:59.759
The deal they signed with Virgin
was a break with the norm.

18:00.080 --> 18:04.919
Artists usually signed for
4 or 5 albums for a percentage.

18:05.120 --> 18:08.039
They said "no,
we own our recordings and

18:08.360 --> 18:12.399
we'll give you the rights for 10 years."

18:12.640 --> 18:15.279
This showed me something.

18:15.480 --> 18:18.839
What I learnt was

18:19.040 --> 18:21.679
that success
is built on solid foundations.

18:21.960 --> 18:25.879
Guy-Man and Thomas
were already thinking

18:26.120 --> 18:27.559
about an international deal.

18:27.800 --> 18:31.359
They already had quite
a clear vision of their career.

18:32.040 --> 18:36.039
Their album was almost ready,
they were finishing it off.

18:36.320 --> 18:39.639
From the start, they already
understand the business.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.119
The business model is in place.

18:42.360 --> 18:46.439
They know they need complete
artistic freedom and control

18:46.680 --> 18:48.719
of their image
and everything else.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.319
They were able
to impose their own rules

18:54.560 --> 18:57.119
because
they were OK financially.

18:57.400 --> 18:59.239
They were not starving.

18:59.640 --> 19:03.399
They even became an example
for hip-hop bands

19:03.680 --> 19:05.359
who were influenced

19:05.640 --> 19:09.359
by their business model

19:09.560 --> 19:12.199
which was said to be
the greatest hold-up ever.

19:26.960 --> 19:31.439
They invited us to listen
to the album in Thomas's flat.

19:32.800 --> 19:37.439
We went with the London Virgin team
and some of the French team.

19:38.640 --> 19:43.039
It was fantastic, a small studio,
with not much equipment.

19:43.840 --> 19:46.159
We listened on a ghetto blaster,

19:46.520 --> 19:48.319
which impressed us all.

19:50.360 --> 19:52.039
It was a revelation.

19:52.280 --> 19:55.359
We listened
to one hit after the other.

20:59.200 --> 21:02.599
Spike Jonze's video
had a huge impact.

21:04.560 --> 21:08.879
When Michel Gondry hears about
Daft Punk, he has the great idea

21:09.440 --> 21:11.959
for the music video
of Around The World.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.199
Where's
that stupid little black box?

21:29.960 --> 21:33.559
I'm looking
for the remote control.

21:35.160 --> 21:36.359
It's crazy.

21:37.240 --> 21:40.439
Why would I have
put it somewhere else?

21:42.080 --> 21:45.919
It has only one use.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.519
That's the story of my life.

22:04.640 --> 22:05.639
Alright.

22:06.600 --> 22:11.279
I met them in a hotel room

22:14.560 --> 22:15.479
in London.

22:17.480 --> 22:22.479
I was sitting on the bed
and they were on chairs.

22:24.040 --> 22:26.559
I don't like having an idea
before talking to the group.

22:27.120 --> 22:32.079
I don't want to get on the wrong track.

22:32.840 --> 22:35.039
I always talk to the band first

22:35.760 --> 22:39.319
before I propose anything at all.

22:43.040 --> 22:44.759
I think it was Guy-Manuel

22:44.960 --> 22:47.679
who came up with the idea
of a choreography.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.639
Choreo-

22:52.440 --> 22:53.359
graphy.

22:54.760 --> 22:57.199
I asked
my designer Florence Fontaine,

22:57.640 --> 22:59.999
although
we did not have much money,

23:00.360 --> 23:01.719
to make robots.

23:01.920 --> 23:04.519
She used motorbike helmets.

23:05.560 --> 23:06.879
She added two antennas.

23:08.520 --> 23:09.879
Then we decided to cover

23:10.080 --> 23:14.839
the visors
with semi-transparent tape.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.559
I think it's the first time
they wore helmets.

23:17.760 --> 23:22.119
Maybe it was their idea
and I just worked around it,

23:22.560 --> 23:26.119
but I think I wanted them
to look like Robocop.

23:34.760 --> 23:35.639
One question,

23:35.840 --> 23:40.719
techno music is supposed to be
underground, anti-star system.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.999
Yet you're becoming stars.

23:43.240 --> 23:44.759
How do you feel about that?

23:45.240 --> 23:47.839
I still believe
it's anti-star system.

23:48.440 --> 23:51.639
We try not to expose
ourselves too much.

23:51.840 --> 23:54.719
The music is the only thing
that really matters.

23:55.080 --> 23:58.159
Then people
decide for themselves.

23:58.360 --> 24:00.879
But we're not really trying
to show ourselves off.

24:05.600 --> 24:08.399
The choice
not to show their faces anymore

24:08.600 --> 24:11.519
was made when they decided

24:12.120 --> 24:15.599
to go to the top
by signing with Virgin

24:15.800 --> 24:19.719
with the aim to sell records
and to conquer pop culture.

24:19.880 --> 24:23.639
Before that, they released EPs
with a small Scottish label.

24:23.840 --> 24:27.639
The movement was underground

24:27.840 --> 24:29.959
so there was no reason
to protect their identities.

24:30.200 --> 24:33.159
Hiding one's face
is part of techno culture.

24:33.440 --> 24:37.559
The founders of techno
like Underground Resistance did it.

24:41.920 --> 24:45.079
When techno emerged,
it was a faceless music.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.599
Back then, people even danced

24:47.800 --> 24:49.559
backs turned to the DJ.

24:51.880 --> 24:56.199
Americans had done it before.
Kraftwerk did it and Kiss.

24:56.480 --> 25:00.479
All pop stars invent
and reinvent themselves.

25:01.320 --> 25:02.999
They aren't born that way.

25:14.320 --> 25:15.879
When I talk to David Bowie,

25:16.120 --> 25:19.559
I'm talking
to one of his thousand avatars.

25:19.760 --> 25:22.519
Not to the Bowie
born in London in 1947.

25:24.000 --> 25:28.679
Those bands influenced them
by using make-up and costumes.

25:30.760 --> 25:31.919
They did photoshoots

25:32.200 --> 25:35.959
at the beginning
but they probably thought

25:36.200 --> 25:38.079
they looked like kids.

25:42.160 --> 25:44.079
What could be smarter?

25:44.320 --> 25:46.839
That was
part of the process as well.

25:47.240 --> 25:50.719
How to still make music
when you're 40?

26:23.360 --> 26:27.919
When Homework is released,
they are what shakes up the 90s,

26:28.200 --> 26:31.519
they bring a new energy
with their electronic music.

26:36.960 --> 26:38.479
It soon becomes clear

26:38.680 --> 26:41.879
that all the major pop stars
want to get in touch

26:42.080 --> 26:44.719
to produce them
or to work with them.

26:49.560 --> 26:52.999
People from all around the world
want to work with them.

26:53.400 --> 26:56.119
Janet Jackson,
Madonna, George Michael...

26:56.400 --> 26:58.319
They all tried
to collaborate with them.

26:58.560 --> 27:01.399
Thomas and Guy-Man
always answered politely

27:01.640 --> 27:04.359
but there was no collaboration.

27:06.960 --> 27:08.159
I can't see a thing.

27:09.880 --> 27:12.119
We have to walk slowly.

27:18.800 --> 27:23.519
They would send me to buy masks
at the last minute like the time

27:24.000 --> 27:25.639
they did the NME cover.

27:27.360 --> 27:30.279
I would buy cheap masks
from joke shops.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.039
It wasn't very well prepared.

27:34.040 --> 27:35.199
Once in Japan,

27:35.440 --> 27:39.239
they went to the shop an hour
before their meeting with EMl.

27:39.440 --> 27:42.439
They bought crazy costumes
to disguise themselves.

27:45.280 --> 27:47.559
They did not
want to play the game.

27:49.920 --> 27:53.439
There's a good story about
meeting Virgin in New York.

27:53.920 --> 27:56.479
We were all
going to a restaurant.

27:56.800 --> 28:00.479
A huge limo was waiting for us.

28:00.840 --> 28:02.679
Thomas and Guy-Man see that.

28:03.880 --> 28:05.119
They don't like it at all.

28:05.720 --> 28:07.759
So they decide to run away.

28:08.120 --> 28:11.679
I'm left alone in this limo
with the people from Virgin.

28:12.160 --> 28:15.199
Thomas and Guy-Man
took the subway

28:15.400 --> 28:17.919
and I got there in the limo
with Virgin.

28:20.120 --> 28:23.839
It's a rejection,
a philosophical position...

28:24.240 --> 28:27.079
They don't partake
in the charade.

30:05.120 --> 30:08.479
Do you use your anonymity
to get closer to your public?

30:09.680 --> 30:12.399
We do live
a lot of exceptional things

30:12.600 --> 30:17.559
but we still have
a very normal everyday life.

30:18.120 --> 30:22.719
We live more like our audience
than the artists

30:23.000 --> 30:26.199
who have
the same kind of fame as ours

30:26.440 --> 30:28.119
but who are attached

30:28.320 --> 30:32.199
to physical recognition
by the public.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.199
The band, and especially Thomas,

30:57.400 --> 31:00.759
had a fascination
for the Millennium bug.

31:00.960 --> 31:04.999
How to explain that in 1999
these two guys wear masks

31:05.240 --> 31:08.399
and on the 1st of January 2000,
they become robots?

31:08.600 --> 31:10.319
That's the Millennium bug.

31:10.560 --> 31:14.919
We told the journalists
that they were in the studio

31:15.200 --> 31:17.399
and at midnight
something happened.

31:17.840 --> 31:20.439
Thomas and Guy-Man
became robots.

31:31.880 --> 31:35.679
WE ARE NOT DEAD

31:35.920 --> 31:40.559
BUT WE'VE BECOME ROBOTS.

32:17.800 --> 32:22.279
I remember very well
the first tests at Alterian.

32:22.560 --> 32:26.799
We'd been driving a long time
to get to Los Angeles.

32:27.040 --> 32:30.639
I was hoping
it would be worth the trip.

32:31.320 --> 32:35.439
We arrive there
and meet Tony Gardner

32:36.360 --> 32:40.719
who was
kind of a nerd, with glasses

32:41.760 --> 32:45.759
surrounded
by monster heads and dolls.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.999
From 2001on, they're
no longer two regular guys.

35:02.480 --> 35:04.319
We're talking to robots.

35:10.280 --> 35:14.159
Last time I interviewed them,
we talked for three hours

35:14.760 --> 35:17.159
and Thomas
never used the word "I".

35:18.680 --> 35:21.399
It's crazy. The first person
singular no longer exists.

35:21.600 --> 35:24.719
It is totally erased.
They are Daft Punk.

35:26.520 --> 35:30.599
It's still playful.
But they control everything.

35:30.840 --> 35:32.759
They're still kids.

37:32.600 --> 37:33.719
One More Time

37:34.000 --> 37:37.159
is THE song that opens up
the USA for them.

37:48.680 --> 37:50.079
It's crazy to think

37:50.280 --> 37:53.599
that it took two French
white guys from Paris

37:53.840 --> 37:56.039
for Americans to discover

37:56.280 --> 38:00.439
house music when it was invented
by African-Americans.

38:58.800 --> 39:01.799
They were lucky
because they started out

39:02.000 --> 39:03.879
at the same time
as home studios.

39:04.120 --> 39:07.199
Albums needn't be recorded
in a limited time anymore.

39:07.640 --> 39:11.759
They can spend
four or five years on an album.

39:39.200 --> 39:42.519
This album
is important for pop music.

39:43.040 --> 39:46.879
It's one
of the first post-sample albums

39:47.200 --> 39:49.839
which builds music
out of other sounds.

40:01.920 --> 40:02.799
Sampling means

40:03.000 --> 40:05.919
taking parts of a song,
looping it over and over

40:06.200 --> 40:08.639
until it becomes music.

40:11.360 --> 40:15.239
But they changed them so much
that samples became unrecognizable.

40:17.520 --> 40:19.119
They had colossal ambitions

40:19.360 --> 40:21.239
for their work.

40:21.440 --> 40:26.239
They recorded their second album
while making Interstella 5555.

40:26.640 --> 40:29.559
It was a silent anime

40:29.840 --> 40:31.319
which came alive with music.

40:32.840 --> 40:35.119
Their original idea
just took off.

40:35.360 --> 40:38.999
The music video
turned into a feature film.

40:40.960 --> 40:44.559
They got into debt
because they were the producers.

40:45.600 --> 40:48.079
No record company
would have produced it.

40:49.360 --> 40:51.959
Daft Punk is not
just about making music.

40:52.360 --> 40:55.159
It means controlling a universe

40:55.400 --> 40:58.599
and protecting it
from any outside intervention.

40:58.840 --> 41:01.519
They answer to no one.
It's punk and rebellious.

41:10.400 --> 41:14.119
Interstella was ten years
ahead of its time,

41:14.320 --> 41:17.879
before the big TV shows
featuring lots of bands

41:18.160 --> 41:21.239
who are then
tied to the network for life.

41:39.240 --> 41:41.479
They made a wishlist of people

41:41.720 --> 41:43.639
they wanted to work with.

41:43.880 --> 41:45.039
Leiji Matsumoto was number 1.

41:45.520 --> 41:48.599
He's the man
behind Captain Harlock.

41:48.800 --> 41:52.239
People born
between 1975 and 1980

41:52.440 --> 41:53.719
were fascinated by

41:53.960 --> 41:55.359
Japanese animes.

41:55.600 --> 41:59.399
Captain Harlock was
quite different from the others

41:59.640 --> 42:02.359
that were childish and colorful.

42:02.560 --> 42:05.279
Captain Harlock
has a huge scar on his face.

42:05.480 --> 42:06.479
He's a pirate.

42:15.520 --> 42:18.359
If not a rebel,
he's definitely marginal.

42:34.360 --> 42:37.639
The way I see it,

42:38.360 --> 42:41.319
the robot has a human heart.

42:43.120 --> 42:47.839
He is
a calm and non-violent being.

42:48.520 --> 42:49.719
If necessary,

42:49.960 --> 42:51.319
he protects people.

42:51.560 --> 42:54.039
He becomes their shield

42:54.320 --> 42:55.919
in order to do so.

42:57.560 --> 42:59.439
This vision come from the traditional

42:59.680 --> 43:01.479
representation of ghosts

43:01.720 --> 43:02.559
and other supernatural beings.

43:02.800 --> 43:05.679
In the Japanese tradition,

43:05.960 --> 43:09.159
they are not evil monsters

43:09.840 --> 43:12.839
but beings who have hearts

43:13.080 --> 43:15.439
and a free spirit.

43:19.800 --> 43:20.919
My hero

43:21.160 --> 43:23.319
Captain Harlock often says

43:23.560 --> 43:26.239
"I live freely under my banner!

43:27.240 --> 43:30.119
But I also accept
all my responsabilities."

43:32.360 --> 43:35.119
All creativity should be
based on this principle.

44:20.560 --> 44:23.519
There was
a kind of reaction after

44:23.760 --> 44:27.399
the huge ambition
of the Discovery album.

44:28.080 --> 44:30.719
We wanted to go back
to something raw.

44:31.840 --> 44:35.799
Since we are Human After All
we'll record it in two weeks.

44:36.400 --> 44:38.519
This is the music
we want to make.

44:41.640 --> 44:43.759
When this album came out,

44:45.560 --> 44:47.959
it disconcerted a lot of people.

44:48.720 --> 44:50.439
Even the media

44:50.680 --> 44:53.919
and people from the label.

44:54.520 --> 44:58.039
It was more difficult
for us to promote

44:58.280 --> 44:59.599
this album.

45:02.200 --> 45:03.719
There was no single to play

45:03.920 --> 45:05.999
on the radio
so we had to find ways

45:06.240 --> 45:09.639
for people
to talk about the album.

45:10.200 --> 45:12.399
I think
the public did not understand.

45:20.080 --> 45:22.319
People are used to saying

45:22.520 --> 45:26.999
debut albums are underground,
the second's a success,

45:27.240 --> 45:30.639
and the third one
even more successful.

45:31.760 --> 45:34.319
But they were not
running after success.

45:34.520 --> 45:37.199
I think
they just wanted to express

45:37.440 --> 45:39.119
what they had inside.

45:42.040 --> 45:44.399
People tend to say

45:44.640 --> 45:46.279
this album is not as good.

45:47.160 --> 45:49.599
People expected
something else from them.

45:50.040 --> 45:52.479
In any case, that's what you hear.

46:06.000 --> 46:09.719
It's interesting to see that
years later, those same critics

46:10.280 --> 46:12.199
reevaluate the album...

46:15.080 --> 46:17.279
and realise the impact it had.

46:17.520 --> 46:21.719
It attracted
a wave of French producers,

46:22.040 --> 46:24.199
the French Touch 2.0,

46:24.440 --> 46:26.959
inspired by Daft Punk's energy

46:27.360 --> 46:31.119
and a return
to the raw energy of techno.

46:31.320 --> 46:33.039
Bands such as Justice

46:33.240 --> 46:36.319
and the new generation
come out of Human After All.

47:19.600 --> 47:22.959
The robots dress up as humans
and eventually kill themselves.

47:23.200 --> 47:26.439
Maybe they were trying
to tell us something.

47:26.720 --> 47:27.879
Is Daft Punk over?

47:37.360 --> 47:38.959
That crossed my mind.

47:39.200 --> 47:44.199
I figured they were done with
the masks and had a new idea:

47:45.000 --> 47:46.279
showing their faces.

47:46.880 --> 47:48.959
They probably thought about it.

47:56.240 --> 47:58.119
They had the great idea

47:58.360 --> 48:02.919
of simplified robots
dressed in black leather.

48:03.320 --> 48:05.999
It was Mad Max meets Tron.

51:47.280 --> 51:49.839
300,000 dollars
for a Daft Punk concert.

51:50.080 --> 51:54.119
I say the band is not touring

51:54.320 --> 51:56.399
but it's a big offer,
so I'll talk to them.

52:01.680 --> 52:05.559
Coachella 2006 was a big risk.

52:05.800 --> 52:08.159
The band
is going through a rough patch.

52:08.440 --> 52:12.319
People think they are
outdated and maybe uncool,

52:12.760 --> 52:16.399
that they didn't reinvent themselves
with Human After All,

52:16.760 --> 52:18.559
which is essential

52:18.840 --> 52:22.159
when you are a major band
of the electronic scene.

52:22.480 --> 52:25.559
They are almost over.

52:30.080 --> 52:33.839
They call me back
a few hours or days later

52:34.080 --> 52:36.639
to ask me to say
they might be interested.

53:05.880 --> 53:10.359
I go to the rehearsal studio
ten days before Coachella.

53:11.320 --> 53:15.799
I see everything, the set-up,
the pyramid, the LEDs...

53:18.760 --> 53:21.599
Now everyone uses LEDs,
even nightclubs.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.199
But back then,

53:23.400 --> 53:27.279
to cover the pyramid with LEDs,
we had to go through

53:27.520 --> 53:32.039
all the suppliers in the USA.
It was no easy task.

53:38.560 --> 53:39.959
Thomas and Guy-Man

53:40.160 --> 53:44.279
ask me to sit down while
they play me what they have prepared.

53:44.520 --> 53:47.159
It was just the audio part.

53:47.360 --> 53:50.959
They don't let me see
the pyramid yet.

53:51.240 --> 53:54.599
It's a mix of their three albums
and it's amazing.

54:14.400 --> 54:18.999
It's Daft Punk's turn to go on
and we're backstage with them.

54:19.520 --> 54:23.279
We're dressing the duo,
checking the last details.

54:23.640 --> 54:26.879
The tent gets so packed
it's overflowing with people.

54:37.880 --> 54:40.599
We realise
Daft Punk's return is awaited.

54:40.880 --> 54:43.079
We start to get the numbers.

54:43.360 --> 54:46.839
There's 40,000 people
when the tent can only host 10,000.

56:21.520 --> 56:23.279
Everyone took out their phones.

56:23.480 --> 56:28.439
It was the time people started
filming with cell phones

56:28.840 --> 56:30.919
and the beginning of YouTube.

56:31.240 --> 56:34.519
It was crazy.

56:34.880 --> 56:39.879
Everybody was so stunned
by the power of the show

56:40.400 --> 56:43.279
that they filmed it
and posted it on YouTube.

56:55.560 --> 56:58.359
I'm not ashamed
to admit I cried.

56:58.960 --> 57:03.319
I was moved by the show
and people's incredible reaction.

57:09.760 --> 57:11.519
It was completely unreal.

57:11.760 --> 57:15.039
A spaceship had landed
in the middle of the desert

57:15.440 --> 57:20.159
and there's 40,000 of us happy,
stunned by the light and sound.

58:21.840 --> 58:25.239
The pyramid was
the start of a gigantic tour

58:25.520 --> 58:28.039
and of a movement
in the United States

58:28.360 --> 58:30.519
called Electronic Dance Music.

58:30.760 --> 58:35.399
The starting point
was the pyramid at Coachella.

58:35.640 --> 58:39.399
A whole generation of musicians
was in the audience.

58:39.680 --> 58:42.359
They discovered it
and they were blown away.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:04.519
Bass players, drummers,

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:07.999
all those musicians are
part of the history of music.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.439
They are the rhythm sections

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.439
of Quincy Jones,
George Benson, Michael Jackson.

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:18.199
It's not easy to sum up
as just a studio musician's thing.

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:23.359
The dream of house music was

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:27.119
to revive the spirit
of dance and disco

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:28.639
which no longer existed.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.039
I think that with Tron,

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:17.399
they got to be students again,
people who wanted to learn.

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:20.799
And God knows how hard
it was for them.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.199
They'd built Daft Punk not to have
to answer to anyone and yet

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:27.639
they're ready to take orders from
one of the largest corporations.

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:30.999
It was like
walking into the lion's den.

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:47.919
When I met Thomas,
I was 12 or 13.

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:51.319
Phantom of the Paradise was
the film that covered it all.

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:53.919
It was like a Warhol trip,

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:56.879
not just the music,
but the film, the cover design.

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.479
This film had it all.

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:14.279
I wanted a mix of the two
to forget that they are robots.

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:18.159
I think that works well.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.719
They didn't take their helmets off,
not for a second.

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:31.719
That obviously created
a surrealist atmosphere.

01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:37.119
We expected them to take
their helmets off between shots.

01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:41.079
But they didn't.
That was very powerful.

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:49.159
I imagine it hasn't always been
easy for them to work together.

01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:53.239
There are a lot of pitfalls
in a career like that.

01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:56.999
Some people may even
have issues with their ego.

01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:01.679
But those two always tried
to stay on the right path,

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:07.159
almost like
a model of human behaviour.

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:09.319
That's very rare.

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:12.839
I've been working
in music for 30 years

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:18.479
and less successful people
don't even say hello.

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:23.919
But not them. They pay
the same attention

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:28.679
whether talking
to a nightclub bouncer

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:31.479
or to the boss
of a record company.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.879
To keep these qualities
throughout your life,

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.039
you have
to win battles with yourself.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.999
