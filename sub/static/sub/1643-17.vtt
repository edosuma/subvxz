SCOFIELD: <i>Previously on</i> Prison Break.

00:08.759 --> 00:10.010
LINCOLN: Did you see the guy
in the viewing room?

00:10.093 --> 00:11.261
SCOFIELDI No.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.930
It was Dad.

00:14.765 --> 00:16.140
I know that guy.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.483
KATIE: What is it?

00:24.566 --> 00:26.443
It was fused into Michael Scofield's skin.

00:26.527 --> 00:30.030
- Where'd it come from?
- As far as I can tell, a guard's uniform.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.156
<i>SUCRE: What's wrong?</i>

00:31.240 --> 00:32.241
The blueprints,

00:32.323 --> 00:35.160
the ones we need to get
from the psych ward to the infirmary,

00:35.244 --> 00:36.453
they're gone.

00:46.797 --> 00:48.632
Hey, that's looking good.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.385
You're making some real progress.

00:51.468 --> 00:53.053
The plaster adds a lot of weight.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.805
I may have to add reinforcements.

00:54.888 --> 00:57.849
Whatever it takes, as long as you get done
in time for the anniversary.

00:57.933 --> 00:59.893
It'll be done. Hold this.

01:01.228 --> 01:03.647
You know, the Shah loved his Taj so much

01:03.730 --> 01:06.650
that he built another temple
just like it on the other side of the river.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.193
It was an absolute mirror image.

01:08.277 --> 01:11.154
Except it was darker,
it was like a black Taj Mahal.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.031
Never heard of it.

01:13.115 --> 01:15.158
Well, that's 'cause it was never completed.

01:15.242 --> 01:18.745
He was overthrown by his favorite son
before he could finish it.

01:20.831 --> 01:23.959
- Sounds like a myth.
- No, it's 100% true.

01:24.251 --> 01:25.252
I think.

01:25.919 --> 01:29.172
Excuse me, Warden.
Dr. Tancredi is here to see you.

01:29.548 --> 01:30.549
Thank you.

01:33.260 --> 01:36.513
POPE: Adams, please escort Mr. Scofield
back to his cell.

01:40.892 --> 01:45.022
- Doctor, what can I do for you?
- Actually, it's about Scofield, sir.

01:46.356 --> 01:47.524
Come in.

01:53.196 --> 01:57.034
- What about Scofield?
- The burn on his back is fairly serious.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.244
He seems to be recovering.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.748
At first, I assumed
he was being assaulted by another inmate,

02:02.831 --> 02:04.833
but I found this embedded
in the skin on his back.

02:04.916 --> 02:07.586
- What's this?
- It's fabric.

02:08.544 --> 02:10.380
Came from a guard's uniform.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.022
What are you doing?

02:27.105 --> 02:29.816
I'm trying to remember those blueprints,

02:30.275 --> 02:32.277
what we lost to the burn.

02:33.028 --> 02:35.155
Without them,
we'll never be able to navigate those pipes

02:35.238 --> 02:36.865
beneath psych ward.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.743
- Any luck?
- No.

02:42.079 --> 02:45.040
I spent a lot of time
studying those blueprints,

02:45.374 --> 02:47.834
<i>tracing them night after night,</i>

02:48.210 --> 02:51.421
<i>considering every possible route
to the infirmary.</i>

02:52.214 --> 02:55.592
It's like trying to take a test
you studied for 10 years ago.

03:03.058 --> 03:04.226
PI!

03:15.904 --> 03:19.032
- How do they get like that, I got no idea.
- I do.

03:19.116 --> 03:22.369
- Tugging on too many pockets.
- She tug on your pocket?

03:22.452 --> 03:26.331
I may be social, but that's
the boundary line even I won't cross.

03:29.084 --> 03:31.086
So how about it, Fish?
When we rolling out?

03:31.169 --> 03:34.214
- One hiccup left, but I'm working on it.
- Yeah, and what is that?

03:34.297 --> 03:37.050
Our road map's
a little incomplete at the moment.

03:39.469 --> 03:42.097
I don't get it.
Why not just go down there again?

03:42.180 --> 03:44.474
'Cause, one, I don't have
the guard's uniform anymore,

03:44.558 --> 03:47.269
which means I can't get across the yard
or past the orderly.

03:47.352 --> 03:50.647
And two, even if I did,
it's a mess down there.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.275
I need this.

03:53.358 --> 03:56.820
- You think you're gonna remember it?
- Not with you hounding me.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.160
Time to wrap it up.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.953
We're going to
have you start exterminating.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.038
- We're not done in here.
- Well, you look done to me.

04:07.122 --> 04:09.583
No, CO,
we still got the carpet to do, man.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.002
No, Bellick is going to bring
professionals in to do that.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.045
Wants the job done right.

04:14.671 --> 04:17.048
- When's that going to happen?
- Tomorrow.

04:23.555 --> 04:26.183
We got a real problem on our hands,
don't we?

04:26.516 --> 04:28.894
Rug monkeys gonna come in here,
tear up that carpet

04:28.977 --> 04:30.854
and that hole's gonna be smiling up
at them.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.023
- We'll have to fill it in.
- We just dug that bitch.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.566
All we need is a piece of plywood

04:34.649 --> 04:37.611
and a couple inches of that
fast-setting concrete on top of it.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.905
The carpet guys will never know
there's anything beneath it.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.406
And the night we break out,

04:41.490 --> 04:44.117
we'll just smash through
with a sledgehammer.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.914
Well, okay. Let's get on it.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.541
We've only got a couple hours
to get this thing done.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.050
Hey, Tweener. You met Avocado?

05:01.510 --> 05:02.844
Yo, what's up?

05:03.595 --> 05:06.723
Lookit. She's just a baby.

05:08.517 --> 05:09.851

05:14.689 --> 05:15.857

05:23.198 --> 05:24.491
Scofield.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.326
What's the 911?

05:26.409 --> 05:30.747
It's 411, and I don't know, man.
I ain't up in his car.

05:31.414 --> 05:33.250
You know,
Avocado's looking for a new cellie.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.585
Boss, come on, man,
I'm trying to break bread with the man,

05:35.669 --> 05:38.421
but I can't get jack
unless I can get to the table.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.090
You know what I'm saying?

05:40.173 --> 05:43.593
Scofield got his own peeps up in Pl.
He don't need me.

05:47.556 --> 05:50.767
- How long this stuff take to dry?
- One, two hours.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.270
Fire on the line.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.085
This place is sweet.

06:17.168 --> 06:18.545
I heard we're getting satellite.

06:18.628 --> 06:22.299
- Yeah, all the porn you can watch, boss.
- Good, good.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.467
You know, you girls
have done such a good job,

06:24.551 --> 06:27.804

It's all sticking together.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.156
Somebody needs to go clean them out.

07:29.199 --> 07:33.536
According to rank, that would be you.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.207
What do I gotta do?

07:37.290 --> 07:40.627
There's a hose out by the shed in the yard.
You can use that.

07:45.048 --> 07:46.424
Clean those, too.

07:49.427 --> 07:50.637
All right.

07:52.055 --> 07:54.391
Sorry I busted up the party, yo.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.286
Who is he?

08:15.370 --> 08:16.955
For your purposes, all you need to know

08:17.038 --> 08:19.332
is that man in the photo
used to work for the Company.

08:19.416 --> 08:20.542
He went rogue.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.627
And how's he involved in this situation?

08:22.711 --> 08:24.337
He's Burrows' father.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.589
Wait, wait, wait.

08:26.673 --> 08:30.760
You picked the son of a Company man
to be our patsy? Did the Company know?

08:30.844 --> 08:33.888
The Company did know.
That was the whole point.

08:34.264 --> 08:35.724
How about you elaborate on that?

08:35.807 --> 08:38.268
How about you
stop with all the questions?

08:38.351 --> 08:41.980
You are a glorified bodyguard, that's it.

08:42.063 --> 08:45.775
Yourjob's to be seen, not to be heard.
Is that understood?

08:53.575 --> 08:56.244
- How close are we?
- Oh, we're good to go, baby.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.038
Got another badge.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.956
What is this, happy hour?

09:12.427 --> 09:14.763

The rest of you round up,
you're done in here.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.643
Hey, CO Patterson said
we had till the end of the day to finish up.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.020
And I say you're done.

09:22.103 --> 09:25.899
There's a couple hours of work
I want done in the yard before sundown.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.485
Come on, let's go.

09:31.154 --> 09:33.490
- We're dead.
- We're not. I'll get it done.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.825
- It's gotta be done tonight.
- I said I'll get it done.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.869
Scofield, Pope's waiting.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.292
Hey, Linc.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.422
You going to let me out?

09:49.506 --> 09:52.383
No, Linc, just came to let you know
they set a new date.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.719
DOC refiled all the paperwork.

09:54.803 --> 09:56.805
Execution's a week from Friday
at midnight.

09:56.888 --> 09:58.306
You going to let me out in the yard
or what?

09:58.389 --> 10:00.809
Unless I hear it from the Pope himself,
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

10:00.892 --> 10:02.936
Come on, man, 10 minutes.
That's all I'm asking.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.395
Ten minutes.

10:05.355 --> 10:06.856
I'm sorry.

10:12.070 --> 10:14.030
Some guy just walks into the courtroom,

10:14.114 --> 10:17.200
drops off some medical records,
Lincoln gets a stay of execution,

10:17.283 --> 10:19.244
then "poof," he disappears into the cold.

10:19.327 --> 10:22.539
Who do you think it could be,
some anti-death penalty fanatic?

10:22.622 --> 10:24.666
Oh, come on, in this case, I doubt it.

10:24.749 --> 10:27.418
But without a name or a paper trail,
we got no way of getting to him.

10:27.502 --> 10:29.337
So once again we have nothing.

10:29.420 --> 10:32.215
I wouldn't exactly call
a two-week stay nothing, okay?

10:32.298 --> 10:33.591
It's more than we had yesterday.

10:33.675 --> 10:35.385
Can I ask you a question?

10:35.468 --> 10:38.138
Do you really think that
you're going to get to the bottom of this?

10:38.221 --> 10:40.014
That they'll let you
get to the bottom of this?

10:40.098 --> 10:42.058
These guys don't exist.

10:42.142 --> 10:45.520
You go after them with the law,
and they'll just use it against you.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.981
We're doing the best we can, okay?

10:48.064 --> 10:50.733
Law's the only way we're going
to bring them to justice, LJ.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.527
They gunned my mother down, man.

10:52.610 --> 10:54.529
You think I give a damn aboutjustice?

10:54.612 --> 10:57.073
I want them.
I wanna do to them what they did to me.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.366
<i>Come on, LA.</i>

10:58.700 --> 11:00.076
It's for the courts to decide, not us.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.536
Look, they're going to slip up, okay?

11:01.619 --> 11:04.080
They're going to leave a piece of evidence
that can't be refuted.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.250
And we're going to be waiting
to nail them when they do.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.588
Maybe they already slipped up.

11:12.547 --> 11:14.424
Up at the cabin, at the well.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.092
Quinn.

11:18.136 --> 11:21.514
- Somebody covered it up.
- They must have come and gotten him.

11:22.056 --> 11:24.142
There's only one way to find out.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.614
Look, there's his cell phone.

11:41.910 --> 11:42.994
Easy.

11:47.290 --> 11:49.083
Okay, a little lower!

11:49.626 --> 11:51.127
A little more.

11:58.009 --> 11:59.552
Okay, I got it.

12:08.645 --> 12:09.646
You Okay?

12:10.313 --> 12:11.856
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.360
Pull me up.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.041
Would you give us a minute, Gary?

12:32.585 --> 12:35.880
Michael, I want you to be
absolutely honest with me.

12:36.631 --> 12:40.218
Dr. Tancredi found this

12:40.301 --> 12:43.346
embedded in your flesh
when she was treating you.

12:43.429 --> 12:46.266
Apparently, it came
from a guard's uniform.

12:46.349 --> 12:48.977
Have you been assaulted by an officer?

12:51.104 --> 12:53.606
Michael, Michael,

12:54.607 --> 12:56.109
I need an answer.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.903
This is not about
sticking to the inmates' code anymore.

12:58.987 --> 13:01.739
This is about officer misconduct.
That's my responsibility.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.908
You wouldn't want to see me
lose my job now, would you?

13:03.992 --> 13:08.037
No, of course not. You have been
very good to me and my brother.

13:08.121 --> 13:11.582
Then I need to know
where you got that burn. Right now.

13:12.667 --> 13:16.212
Otherwise, your ass is going to solitary.
You understand?

13:16.754 --> 13:18.381
It's your choice.

13:20.550 --> 13:23.303
Don't... Hey, please, listen to me.

13:23.553 --> 13:26.139
- Cool down!
- Listen to me, don't do this!

13:26.222 --> 13:27.724
Don't do this!

13:30.601 --> 13:31.853
Michael!

13:32.895 --> 13:33.938
No!

13:48.995 --> 13:50.121
Michael?

13:52.790 --> 13:54.042
Michael?

13:54.876 --> 13:55.960
Michael?

14:01.299 --> 14:03.926
- Linc?
- What the hell are you doing in here?

14:05.928 --> 14:08.890
Linc, we're in a lot of trouble now.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.351
What happened?

14:11.434 --> 14:13.603
The Pope asked some questions

14:14.312 --> 14:15.897
that I couldn't answer.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.315
About what?

14:18.733 --> 14:22.278
He's got proof that I was
where I wasn't supposed to be.

14:22.653 --> 14:26.616
He doesn't know it, but sooner or later
he's going to put the whole thing together.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.409
There's no way out of this.

14:28.493 --> 14:29.952
Yeah, there is.

14:30.078 --> 14:32.538
- You just got to keep the faith.
- No.

14:33.289 --> 14:36.584
I put my blood into this,
and it's coming apart.

14:36.751 --> 14:37.919
Listen to me.

14:38.002 --> 14:40.546
The whole point of solitary is to break you,

14:40.755 --> 14:42.090
make you crazy.

14:42.173 --> 14:45.009
You got to keep strong, you hear me?

14:45.426 --> 14:47.136
Don't let them break you.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.430
I put my blood into this.

Look, baby, I'm so sorry it took me so long
to get back to you.

Turns out that our division is not
getting mobilized for a couple more days.

15:03.194 --> 15:05.863
When I didn't hear from you,
I didn't know what to think, baby.

15:05.947 --> 15:09.742
I got so worried. I started
watching the news, looking for casualties.

15:10.159 --> 15:13.162
I'm so sorry about all this.
You gotta believe that.

15:14.497 --> 15:16.833

the rear detachment office,

15:16.916 --> 15:20.002
asking if there was some sort of problem
with the 117th.

15:23.673 --> 15:24.674
No.

<i>A couple more days,
and we'll be on those hops, baby.</i>

15:32.473 --> 15:35.184
That's not what
the rear detachment officer said.

15:35.268 --> 15:38.813
<i>He said the 117th wasn't coming home
for another six months.</i>

15:38.896 --> 15:42.817
What? No. That can't be right.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.360
That's what he said.

15:44.861 --> 15:46.904
You know what it is?

15:47.196 --> 15:48.906
It's because we're transpo.

15:48.990 --> 15:52.076
You know, technically
we're on a loan-out from the 140th.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.162
I mean, that's why he said that.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.914
- The 140th?
- Yeah, yeah.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.084
It's just a few more days.

16:01.752 --> 16:04.088

16:04.172 --> 16:05.882

16:05.965 --> 16:09.594
I will call you

in that room over there

I can get into the guards' room.

But even if I do, and I fill that hole in,
I'll still be in that room.

(DOOR BUZZES)

36:24.641 --> 36:25.892
Michael!

36:27.936 --> 36:30.105
Michael! Michael!

37:50.852 --> 37:53.271
He's totally non-responsive,
so start him on chlorpromazine.

37:53.354 --> 37:55.190
And I believe he's in danger
of a psychotic break.

37:55.273 --> 37:57.400
I want you to notify me immediately
if and when that happens.

37:57.484 --> 37:58.526
GUARD: All right.
SARA: Thank you.

37:58.610 --> 37:59.611
Come on.

38:01.488 --> 38:03.031
Come this way.
Come on. Here you go.

38:04.699 --> 38:06.117
Watch your step.

38:13.875 --> 38:15.335
Clean him up.

38:50.954 --> 38:52.413
(DOOR OPENING)

39:08.179 --> 39:09.305
(GUN CLICKING)

39:13.643 --> 39:15.144
You scared me.

39:17.105 --> 39:18.523
Put it down. You're not a killer.

39:18.606 --> 39:21.067
You don't want to make
any rash mistakes here, LJ.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.573
- Don't move!
- Go easy, go easy...

39:26.656 --> 39:27.866
Shut up!

39:28.366 --> 39:30.952
LJ, there's other ways out of this,
you know, okay?

39:31.035 --> 39:32.287
I can help you beat this rap,

39:32.370 --> 39:35.123
but if you pull that trigger,
you really will be a killer,

39:35.206 --> 39:36.791
and then I can't help you, okay?

39:36.875 --> 39:39.168
I'm government, LJ.
There's a lot of things I can do for you.

39:39.252 --> 39:41.754
The only thing you can do for me is die!

39:42.005 --> 39:43.381
Drop your weapon!

39:44.841 --> 39:46.593
I said drop your weapon!

39:47.886 --> 39:51.014
Guess you're going to have to take
a rain check on that one, huh?

39:53.933 --> 39:55.727
COP: Drop the gun now!

40:10.700 --> 40:12.660
No. I did what you said.

40:12.952 --> 40:15.413
BELLICK: You brought me a pile of crap.
There was nothing there.

40:15.496 --> 40:17.540
Boss, come on, man.
I just need some more time.

40:17.624 --> 40:20.627
You had your time.
You're a waste of my fries.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.173
Open on 88!

40:25.256 --> 40:26.883
Boss, come on, man!

40:27.008 --> 40:28.176
(DOOR BUZZING)

40:28.843 --> 40:31.137
Dude, just give me another try.

40:35.683 --> 40:37.101
Close on 88!

40:41.522 --> 40:42.899
Have at it.

40:44.692 --> 40:45.777
Boss.

40:48.905 --> 40:50.031
Boss!

40:54.285 --> 40:57.747
COP: You're lucky.
Kid's got a warrant for double homicide.

40:58.373 --> 41:01.084
- Oh, dear. Are you serious?
- Did you have any prior contact with him?

41:01.167 --> 41:03.252
- Any idea why he chose your house?
- No,none.

41:03.336 --> 41:05.630
I mean, he was screaming something like,
"You killed my mom,"

41:05.713 --> 41:09.801
and going on
about me being a government agent, and...

41:09.968 --> 41:12.929
I don't know, it just seemed like that kid
was on drugs or something.

41:13.012 --> 41:14.973
What do you do for a living, Mr. Kravecki?

41:15.056 --> 41:19.102
I'm a regional sales manager
for a dehydrated meat distributor.

41:19.227 --> 41:21.562
- What, you mean like jerky?
- Yes.

41:21.646 --> 41:23.731
- You a fan?
- What kind?

41:23.815 --> 41:25.024
Buffalo.

41:28.319 --> 41:31.656
Have some. Really.
I'm swimming in the stuff.

41:44.085 --> 41:45.878
One hour till lunch.

41:55.596 --> 41:56.931
So, what's the problem?

41:57.015 --> 41:58.433
You're looking at it.

41:58.516 --> 42:01.394
ABRUZZI: What, Haywire?
- Yep. He's my new cellmate.

42:01.686 --> 42:05.314
They think I have schizoaffective disorder
with bipolar tendencies.

42:14.824 --> 42:15.867
Your tattoos.

42:15.950 --> 42:17.035
What about them?

42:17.118 --> 42:18.870
- What are they of?
- They're just tattoos.

42:18.953 --> 42:20.788
The man's got a maze on his skin.

42:20.872 --> 42:21.914
Why would he do that?

42:21.998 --> 42:24.167
Why would he put a maze on his skin?

42:24.542 --> 42:26.044
It's a pathway.

42:26.127 --> 42:27.587
Where does it lead?

42:30.214 --> 42:31.507
Hello, roomie.

42:33.176 --> 42:35.511
You were right about my tattoo.

42:35.678 --> 42:38.222
It is a path, just like you thought.

42:38.723 --> 42:42.643
And I need you to remember
when you saw it, Haywire.

42:43.019 --> 42:45.188
I need you to remember
what it looked like.

42:45.271 --> 42:47.482
Do you think you can do that for me?

42:50.359 --> 42:51.778
Who are you?
