it's your favorite agent.</i>

00:17.918 --> 00:19.320
<i>Miles has met with Martin</i>

00:19.453 --> 00:21.055

in New York.</i>

00:21.189 --> 00:23.357
<i>It's not gonna happen.
I'm sorry.</i>

00:23.491 --> 00:25.126
<i>I know how much
you wanted this.</i>

00:25.259 --> 00:27.261
<i>They just want younger,
blonder,</i>

00:27.395 --> 00:29.197
<i>Meantime, Kira's going to
send you</i>

00:29.330 --> 00:31.065
<i>the name of my new facialist.</i>

00:31.199 --> 00:33.567
<i>She does wonders.</i>

00:33.701 --> 00:35.069
- Damn it.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.074
- Morning.
- Is everybody ready

00:40.208 --> 00:41.409
to get some butts
out of some beds?

00:41.542 --> 00:43.344
- You're too damn happy.

00:43.477 --> 00:46.847
- Cheerful is a choice.
You should try it.

00:46.980 --> 00:48.749
- Well, I like to save it
for the camera.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.419
- Oh, don't be such
a Negative Nancy.

00:53.254 --> 00:54.855
What am I smelling?

00:54.988 --> 00:56.857
- It's cloudy with a chance
of sprinkles.

00:56.990 --> 00:59.727
I got chocolate.
I got glazed. I got--

00:59.860 --> 01:02.330
- There is a rule.

01:03.030 --> 01:06.800
- Pink frosted for the lady?
- No food on set.

01:06.934 --> 01:08.702
Unless it's part of a segment.

01:08.836 --> 01:11.805
- And we're live in five.
- No bagels, no pizza,

01:11.939 --> 01:13.907
no birthday cupcakes,
no donuts.

01:14.041 --> 01:15.176
- Relax.
He's just trying to be nice.

01:15.309 --> 01:17.911
- Three. Two.

01:21.849 --> 01:24.685
Good morning, Phoenix.
I'm Christine Collins.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.620
And I would love
to be bringing you

01:26.754 --> 01:28.289
the breaking news right now,

01:28.422 --> 01:33.627
but instead,
I am smelling donuts.

01:35.529 --> 01:38.299
Our new 25-year-old weatherman
just wants to be liked.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.468
So now I get to spend
the entire broadcast

01:40.601 --> 01:41.802
thinking about donuts.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.671
- Let's go to traffic.

01:43.804 --> 01:46.240
- Aren't we all trying
not to eat donuts?

01:46.374 --> 01:48.075
Aren't we juicing and cleansing
and cutting out dairy

01:48.209 --> 01:49.977
and cutting out carbs?
It's hard enough

01:50.110 --> 01:53.914
to get through the day
on protein powder and spinach.

01:54.047 --> 01:56.016
I do not need to be tortured
by the aroma

01:56.150 --> 01:57.518
of a chocolate eclair.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.787
And yes, oh, I know,
he's trying to be nice.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.822
But it's not nice.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.991
You know what would be nice?
Sleeping in

02:04.124 --> 02:07.295
or not shooting my face
full of medical-grade poison.

02:07.428 --> 02:08.462
And you know what?

02:09.963 --> 02:12.233
It would be great
to eat a donut.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.134
But I'm supposed to be thin
and perky

02:14.268 --> 02:15.636
and perpetually quaffed.

02:15.769 --> 02:18.706
Forever young.
I give everything.

02:18.839 --> 02:20.974
But it's not enough.
It's--it's--it's...ha.

02:21.108 --> 02:22.943
It's never enough.

02:23.076 --> 02:28.249
All I am asking is that
you do not make it harder,

02:28.382 --> 02:31.118
because it is
hard enough already!

02:31.252 --> 02:33.854
- Okay. Looks like somebody
needs a vacation, huh?

02:36.156 --> 02:39.026
We'll be right back with back
to school looks for less.

02:44.698 --> 02:51.839
<i>* *</i>

03:11.392 --> 03:14.094

03:42.723 --> 03:46.059
<i>and this is my island.</i>

03:46.193 --> 03:51.265
<i>Like my great uncle before me,
I make fantasies come true.</i>

03:51.399 --> 03:55.503
<i>What is your deepest desire,
your most heartfelt need?</i>

03:59.607 --> 04:03.444
<i>The Island knows
even if you don't.</i>

04:05.379 --> 04:07.315
<i>My family have been
the guardians of this island</i>

04:07.448 --> 04:09.650
<i>for generations.</i>

04:09.783 --> 04:14.121
<i>Our mission--to transform
the life of every guest.</i>

04:14.254 --> 04:16.357
<i>- * Whoa oh oh oh oh *</i>

04:16.490 --> 04:21.094
- Smiles, everyone.

04:21.228 --> 04:23.263
<i>- * Bag of tricks,
now watch me move *</i>

04:24.665 --> 04:25.566
- Captain.

04:26.967 --> 04:30.003
- Roarke,
you've been avoiding me.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.939
- Hmm. To avoid you,

04:32.072 --> 04:35.108
I'd have to think of you,
which I haven't.

04:35.242 --> 04:37.611
- I'd just like you to admit
that we had a moment.

04:37.745 --> 04:39.279
- Oh, we had a moment.
- Mm-hmm.

04:39.413 --> 04:42.350
- But it passed.
- Set myself up for that.

04:44.251 --> 04:45.786
- The guests are waiting.

04:51.191 --> 04:52.993
<i>* *</i>

04:53.126 --> 04:55.729
- Welcome. Welcome.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.531
How are you? Hi.

04:57.665 --> 05:00.000
Ruby and Mel Akuda, this is
Ms. Elena Roarke, your host.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.403
- Good afternoon,
Mr. and Mrs. Akuda.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.338
You must be so tired
from your trip, huh?

05:04.472 --> 05:06.139
- Yeah,
we're pretty well tuckered.

05:06.273 --> 05:07.841
Especially Ruby, she--

05:07.975 --> 05:09.109
- Thrilled to be
on this island.

05:09.242 --> 05:10.478
- Yeah.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.480
- And yes, we'd love
to freshen up.

05:12.613 --> 05:15.015
- Of course. Yeah, Ash will
get you settled in your suite.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.284
I'll meet you later. Enjoy.

05:20.087 --> 05:22.923
- This is Christine Collins,
fresh from Phoenix, Arizona.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.793
- Ms. Collins,
I'm your host Elena Roarke.

05:25.926 --> 05:29.363
- Wonderful to meet you.
Sorry, I'm a bit of a mess.

05:29.497 --> 05:31.499
- It's okay. We'll fix that.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.938
<i>- I'm--I'm-
I'm smelling donuts.</i>

05:38.071 --> 05:40.207
<i>Aah!
* Donut, donut *</i>

05:40.340 --> 05:43.377
- Remixing my epic meltdown
has become a national pastime.

05:43.511 --> 05:45.446
- Well,
if it's any consolation,

05:45.579 --> 05:47.981
this blue
looks fabulous on you.

05:48.649 --> 05:51.519
So tell me, what can the Island
do for you, hmm?

05:51.652 --> 05:54.922
- My fantasy is to eat

05:55.055 --> 05:57.057
and eat and eat and eat.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.927
And when I leave here,

06:00.060 --> 06:02.496
I need my body
to look exactly the same.

06:02.630 --> 06:03.997
- I see.

06:04.131 --> 06:06.567
- That's not possible.
I knew it.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.069
- No, no, no.
It's absolutely possible.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.704
But this is Fantasy Island,

06:10.838 --> 06:13.240
and I can make your most
outrageous wish come true.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.843
And that's what you want,
a buffet?

06:15.976 --> 06:19.079
My first job was at this tiny
little station in Amarillo.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.214
I loved it so much.

06:21.348 --> 06:23.250
I was so proud
of my dream job.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.119
One night, I went on a date.

06:26.253 --> 06:28.822
I had a slice of pizza,
had two beers.

06:28.956 --> 06:30.558
We split dessert.

06:30.691 --> 06:36.029
Two days later, I got
my first letter from a viewer.

06:36.163 --> 06:40.434
She was worried
because I had gained weight.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.235
And she was sure that meant

06:42.369 --> 06:45.573
that I was having
some kind of personal problems.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.941
So I have been hungry
ever since.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.877
- I was just wonder...

06:50.010 --> 06:53.947
is it food that you're hungry
for or something deeper?

06:54.081 --> 06:56.416
- I have a therapist. Thanks.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.385
I came here for cheeseburgers.

06:58.519 --> 07:02.089
- Let's get started. Ready?

07:05.192 --> 07:10.864
<i>* *</i>

07:10.998 --> 07:12.633
- A chocolate truffle.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.368
If I gain one ounce--
- Not one ounce.

07:15.503 --> 07:16.937
You have my word.

07:21.475 --> 07:24.545
- Mmm, mmm.

07:29.216 --> 07:30.751
Mmm!

07:30.884 --> 07:33.420
- Welcome to Fantasy Island.

07:38.526 --> 07:42.830
<i>* *</i>

07:42.963 --> 07:45.365
<i>- * Can I make you mine *</i>

07:45.499 --> 07:47.835
<i>* Can I take your time *</i>

07:47.968 --> 07:50.403
<i>* 'Cause you feel all right *</i>

07:50.538 --> 07:54.775
<i>* And you'll get me
hi-igh-igh *</i>

07:54.908 --> 07:57.444
- Oh ho ho.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.713
<i>* *</i>

07:59.847 --> 08:02.249
<i>- * So give me all you got *</i>

08:02.382 --> 08:05.052
<i>* *</i>

08:05.185 --> 08:07.120
<i>* You know you hit the spot *</i>

08:07.254 --> 08:10.357
<i>* *</i>

08:10.490 --> 08:12.492
<i>* Give me all you got *</i>

08:12.626 --> 08:19.533
<i>* *</i>

08:19.667 --> 08:20.701
<i>* You know you hit the spot *</i>

08:20.834 --> 08:23.003
- Oh, I can't believe it.

08:23.136 --> 08:25.338
- Having fun,
Mr. and Mrs. Akuda?

08:25.472 --> 08:27.440
- Oh, just call us
Mel and Ruby.

08:27.575 --> 08:29.877
- And yes, we are.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.746
I swear the sun
feels different here.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.883
- Oh, the water is bluer.
The air is sweeter.

08:36.016 --> 08:39.352
And yes, the grass
really is greener.

08:39.486 --> 08:43.123
- I might not need a fantasy.
- Well, the Island disagrees.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.558
You know, if you're here,

08:44.692 --> 08:46.694
it's because
there's a reason for it.

08:46.827 --> 08:50.998
So tell me, how did you
hear about Fantasy Island?

08:51.131 --> 08:52.700
- Well, we still get
the newspaper,

08:52.833 --> 08:54.001
the kind
that's actually on paper.

08:55.636 --> 08:58.005
- We saw this little ad
with a phone number.

08:58.138 --> 09:01.942
Something inside said call,
And here we are.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.612
- It's an honor
to help people like you.

09:04.745 --> 09:08.716
Mel, Ruby, what can
the Island do for you?

09:09.917 --> 09:14.154
- Ruby has, uh, she has cancer,
pancreatic.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.223
- I'm a goner.

09:16.356 --> 09:17.858
- I'm so sorry.

09:17.991 --> 09:21.228
- Our fantasy is to make her
feel healthy again

09:21.361 --> 09:23.430
just for a few days.

09:23.563 --> 09:27.067
She spent so much of her life
caring for others, for me,

09:27.200 --> 09:29.670
our kids, our grandkids.

09:29.803 --> 09:34.141
I want her to have a weekend
that's all about her.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.710
- And what does
that weekend entail?

09:36.844 --> 09:40.547
- Dancing, walking on
the beach, wonderful food.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.750
- Now, Ruby,
I need to be clear.

09:42.883 --> 09:46.419
Even I can't cure your cancer.
I wish I could.

09:46.553 --> 09:48.221
- I know that, sweetheart.

09:48.355 --> 09:52.292
I'm looking for a fantasy,
not a miracle.

09:53.193 --> 09:56.229
- Most people don't realize
there's a difference.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.634
This map leads you to the place
where the fantasy will begin.

10:02.870 --> 10:05.572
- Thank you for this.
It means the world to us.

10:05.706 --> 10:08.575
- It's my pleasure.

10:08.709 --> 10:11.779
And welcome to Fantasy Island.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.955
- Look out now. Don't want you
to fall and break a hip.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.391
- Worry about yourself,
old man.

10:24.524 --> 10:25.959
And move your butt.

10:26.093 --> 10:27.494
I want to get
to the good stuff.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.096
- Speaking of butts,

10:29.229 --> 10:31.198
yours still looks pretty damn
good to me.

10:31.331 --> 10:34.234
- You're half blind.
But I'll take it.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.537
I'm comin'.

10:45.578 --> 10:47.280
- That's real pretty.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.655
Now what?

10:57.457 --> 10:59.526
What the hell are you doing?

11:01.628 --> 11:03.430
- I'm going in.

11:05.432 --> 11:06.734
- Wait for me.

11:13.774 --> 11:20.680
<i>* *</i>

11:45.205 --> 11:47.674
- Look at you.
- Look at you!

11:51.278 --> 11:54.214
- It really is a miracle.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.290
I almost can't believe
they're mine.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.192
- Yeah.
Try looking in the mirror

12:05.325 --> 12:07.928
and seeing all this hair.
-

12:08.061 --> 12:10.397
And not a bit of it
growing out of your ears.

12:13.033 --> 12:17.737
- Also, no reflux.
Bring on the tomato sauce.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.244
- Youth really is wasted
on the young.

12:24.377 --> 12:25.478
- Mmm.
- Ha.

12:27.114 --> 12:29.549
- Man, when I look back on us,

12:29.682 --> 12:32.752
when we were this age...

12:32.886 --> 12:35.322
we didn't know a damn thing.
- Hmm.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.925
Still don't half the time.
- Mmm.

12:38.058 --> 12:43.663
- Yeah, let's--let's not think
at all right now, you know?

12:43.797 --> 12:49.302
Let's just feel how we are in
these healthy and young bodies.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.638
- Well, if we're just feelin',

12:51.771 --> 12:53.874
might I suggest round four?

12:54.007 --> 12:57.110
- Okay. Later.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.346
Right now, I want to
go out for a run.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.781
Test out my knees.

13:01.915 --> 13:04.184
- You do your thing.

13:04.317 --> 13:07.187
I saw there's
a beach party tonight.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.622
Maybe we should go, you know,

13:09.756 --> 13:12.592
mingle with the other
young people, get crazy.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.932
- It's a date.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.869
- Hey, sweet pea.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.436
- Hmm.

13:23.570 --> 13:26.106
- The gray hair

13:26.239 --> 13:28.876
and the wrinkles makes you

13:29.009 --> 13:30.743
all the more beautiful to me.

13:30.878 --> 13:32.946
I just want you to know that.

13:33.080 --> 13:36.716
- I do, Mel. I do.

13:44.357 --> 13:49.629
<i>* *</i>

13:57.604 --> 14:04.511
<i>* *</i>

14:27.500 --> 14:30.938
<i>* *</i>

14:32.305 --> 14:34.041
Ahh...

14:34.174 --> 14:41.081
<i>* *</i>

14:42.815 --> 14:46.119
- It's a dragon roll
from that little sushi place

14:46.253 --> 14:48.188
around the corner
from the TV station.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.490
- The girls at work told me
about those.

14:50.623 --> 14:53.460
I've never gotten to try one.
It's too many calories.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.628
- Not today!

14:55.762 --> 14:57.164
- Oh! Ooh!

15:00.167 --> 15:02.735
Mmm, mmm. Mmm!

15:02.869 --> 15:06.339
- Christine Collins,
this is your life in food.

15:06.473 --> 15:07.840
Salud.

15:07.975 --> 15:09.977
- Salud. Mmm.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.281
- Mmm...

15:20.353 --> 15:23.290
- Butter popcorn, mmm,
delicious,

15:23.423 --> 15:25.292
from that movie theater
where you were supposed to have

15:25.425 --> 15:27.460
that blind date that
your hairdresser set you up on.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.396
- Oh, he wanted to see
the late show.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.131
But I got up at 2:45
in the morning.

15:31.264 --> 15:34.267
I can't do late shows.
- I know. I know.

15:34.401 --> 15:36.936
Well, he got married
and has two kids.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.705
Can I ask you something?

15:38.838 --> 15:40.340
Do other people
in your profession,

15:40.473 --> 15:42.442
do they sacrifice
as much as you do?

15:44.211 --> 15:45.878
- Um...

15:48.215 --> 15:49.449
What's this?

15:49.582 --> 15:51.151
- Let me see.

15:51.284 --> 15:54.454
Oh, yeah, I believe
that is called fluffernutter.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.656
Not my personal favorite.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.392
But your mom made them for you
every single day after school.

15:59.526 --> 16:01.728
- Why would I want that?
- I don't know.

16:01.861 --> 16:06.266
This banquet was catered
for your taste, not mine.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.602
Ooh, look at this!

16:09.736 --> 16:13.140
How...huge.

16:20.013 --> 16:23.850
The year was 1984 and everybody
was getting footloose.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.618
- I don't want this cake.
- Christine,

16:25.752 --> 16:27.354
I can't help you
if you don't let me.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.356
- I don't need your help.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.258
Get it away from me!

16:31.391 --> 16:32.359
Oh--ah--

16:32.492 --> 16:34.127
Aah!

16:34.261 --> 16:35.862
<i>- * We gonna take it

16:37.897 --> 16:44.704

16:46.173 --> 16:48.041

16:48.175 --> 16:49.809

- There ya go.

16:49.942 --> 16:52.312
- Oh!
-

16:55.548 --> 16:58.151
Mm.
Come on over here, honey.

16:58.285 --> 17:01.554
You're part of this too.

17:01.688 --> 17:04.891
- Congratulations, Mom.
- Ohh...

17:05.024 --> 17:08.395
We're family now, Crystal Joe.
Us and Landon.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.564
- That's right.
I love your mother.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.002
I'm gonna take care of her.
You too, kiddo.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.405
- Yes, sir.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.707
- Amy.
- Oh, I'll be right back.

17:20.840 --> 17:22.409
- Mm-hmm.
Hey, don't eat too much

17:22.542 --> 17:24.043
of that cake, you hear me?

17:24.177 --> 17:26.946
No kid of mine's
gonna be a heifer.

17:32.352 --> 17:39.126
<i>* *</i>

17:42.028 --> 17:43.930
- Good morning, New York City.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.899
I'm Crystal Joe Stevens coming
to you live from Times Square.

17:47.033 --> 17:48.401
Don't change that dial.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.437
Stick with me
for all the breaking news.

17:51.804 --> 17:55.442
- My daughter,
the next Diane Sawyer.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.444
- I don't know about that.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.779
- I believe in you,
Crystal Joe.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.114
You're gonna get out of here.

18:01.248 --> 18:04.251
I never did. But you will.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.386
Promise me.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.788
- I promise.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.491
- What are you two
whispering about?

18:11.624 --> 18:13.493
- Crystal Joe promised me
she's gonna get herself

18:13.626 --> 18:15.962
on TV someday.
- That right?

18:16.095 --> 18:18.265
Yeah, you got
a good voice for it.

18:18.398 --> 18:19.632
- You think?
- Mm-hmm.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.934
Of course, the, uh,

18:22.068 --> 18:24.737
crooked horse teeth are a problem.

18:24.871 --> 18:26.973
And you got a few extra pounds.

18:27.106 --> 18:30.109
- Landon, what a thing to say.

18:32.545 --> 18:35.047
I'll tell you what, kiddo.

18:35.182 --> 18:37.950
I'll pay to get
your teeth fixed.

18:38.084 --> 18:39.686
- You will?
- Mm-hmm.

18:39.819 --> 18:43.456
You and me will make
it happen together. Deal?

18:43.590 --> 18:45.292
- No. Say no.

18:48.027 --> 18:49.662
- Deal.
- All right.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.334
- Christine.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.370
- Why did you bring me here?

18:57.504 --> 19:00.973
- It's a taste of the
Madeleine soaked in tea.

19:01.107 --> 19:05.245
Proust. A taste from youth can
unlock a lifetime of memories,

19:05.378 --> 19:06.913
and not always good ones.

19:07.046 --> 19:10.517
- I let go of that girl
and that life decades ago.

19:10.650 --> 19:11.818
As far as I'm concerned,

19:11.951 --> 19:14.020
Crystal Joe Stevens
never existed.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.555
- Crystal Joe Stevens had a mom

19:15.688 --> 19:19.359
who loved her so much
and believed in her.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.594
- I came to Fantasy Island
to stuff my face,

19:21.728 --> 19:23.430
and I'm really, really hungry,

19:23.563 --> 19:26.566
so can you please just get me
back to the damn buffet?!

19:26.699 --> 19:29.068
- Yes. Of course.

19:53.260 --> 20:00.166
<i>* *</i>

20:07.340 --> 20:11.344
- 8.5. Can I...join you?

20:11.478 --> 20:14.347
- Sure, but gotta warn you,

20:14.481 --> 20:16.115
I'm feeling good.

20:16.249 --> 20:17.417
- Okay.

20:19.252 --> 20:26.158
<i>* *</i>

20:40.139 --> 20:41.841
I'm Ruby.

20:41.974 --> 20:43.276
<i>- Yo soy Isla.</i>

20:43.410 --> 20:45.778
- Okay.

20:54.421 --> 20:57.390
- I think maybe
I'm lucky I met you.

20:58.358 --> 21:02.762
- Oh, uh, I should...
I should go.

21:02.895 --> 21:05.565
Yeah.
But it was...

21:05.698 --> 21:07.467
nice to meet you.

21:23.049 --> 21:24.250
- Mmm, mmm, mmm.

21:24.384 --> 21:25.618
- Crystal Joe.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.658
- Landon?

21:37.263 --> 21:39.131
- I missed you, kiddo.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.839
- How did he get here?
- Good question.

21:46.973 --> 21:49.041
Now a better question is
why is he here?

21:49.175 --> 21:52.512
- Uh, to mess with me,
to ruin my life.

21:55.548 --> 21:58.150
Do you know when you get a song
stuck in your head,

21:58.284 --> 21:59.686
a song you can't stand

21:59.819 --> 22:02.989
but it's just stuck
in your head for weeks?

22:03.122 --> 22:07.527
Landon was in my head
for years.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.296
When my mom died,
I was stuck with him.

22:10.430 --> 22:13.332
But I got away.

22:13.466 --> 22:15.468
I remade my whole life.

22:15.602 --> 22:17.404
- Did you get away,
Crystal Joe?

22:17.537 --> 22:19.138
- Don't call me that.
- Or did you just start

22:19.271 --> 22:20.873
listening to the meanness
in other voices?

22:21.007 --> 22:22.875
Because yes, yes, you left.

22:23.009 --> 22:26.178
But did you escape?
Hmm?

22:26.312 --> 22:28.981
No, no. Mm-mm.

22:29.115 --> 22:32.385
That is manchineel fruit.
It's poison fruit.

22:32.519 --> 22:35.688
- You keep poison fruit
on your desk?

22:35.822 --> 22:38.324
- It's a good reminder,
I think,

22:38.458 --> 22:40.192
that things are not
always as they seem.

22:40.326 --> 22:41.828
You certainly aren't.

22:43.095 --> 22:44.697
You know what,

22:44.831 --> 22:46.633
I'm gonna have the servers
bring a meal to your room.

22:46.766 --> 22:48.000
Do you have
any special requests?

22:48.134 --> 22:51.504
- Yes. No. Oh, God.

22:51.638 --> 22:53.039
I've been craving something,

22:53.172 --> 22:55.374
but I just--I cannot
put my finger on what.

22:57.510 --> 22:59.479
- Okay, I'll have the kitchen
send a selection.

23:05.084 --> 23:08.455
<i>* *</i>

23:08.588 --> 23:11.257
- Check it out.
Let's go do some drugs.

23:13.125 --> 23:15.495
Mel Akuda, we've never
done drugs in our life.

23:15.628 --> 23:18.364
And this isn't drugs.
It's goo.

23:18.498 --> 23:21.568
- It's Island Magic.
It opens up new ways of seeing.

23:21.701 --> 23:23.235
It's quite safe. I assure you.

23:23.369 --> 23:26.272
- Well, Ms. Roarke,
we are having the best time.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.941
- Oh, I'm so glad to hear it.
And it's Elena, by the way.

23:29.075 --> 23:32.712
- Aw.
- Enjoy the Island Magic.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.947
The night is young.
-

23:37.917 --> 23:41.153
- Mmm?
- You are a terrible influence.

23:41.287 --> 23:44.290
- Well, we won't tell the kids.
- Mmm.

23:52.131 --> 23:55.401
- You're late, Captain.
- I know. I know.

23:55.535 --> 23:57.737
Late for a very important date.

23:57.870 --> 24:01.808
To talk about the departure
schedule. Sorry.

24:01.941 --> 24:05.444
- I broke out the good stuff.
- I see that.

24:05.578 --> 24:07.446
Want to talk about it?

24:08.648 --> 24:10.750
- No.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.656
- Okay.

24:16.789 --> 24:21.093
It's one of the guests,
Ruby Akuda.

24:21.227 --> 24:25.698
You know, I--I can usually
maintain an emotional distance

24:25.832 --> 24:27.667
from the guests.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.969
If I didn't,
I'd get lost in their needs,

24:30.102 --> 24:31.638
and then I wouldn't be able
to do my job.

24:33.906 --> 24:36.743
But with this lady,
with Ruby...

24:36.876 --> 24:38.811
mm...

24:38.945 --> 24:40.613
it's different.

24:43.415 --> 24:45.284
- 'Cause she's dying.

24:46.586 --> 24:48.354
- I'm sad for her.

24:50.222 --> 24:52.959
And I'm sad for me too, and...

24:53.092 --> 24:55.027
doesn't usually happen.

24:59.932 --> 25:01.601
- You know what I think?

25:01.734 --> 25:04.604
I think Mrs. Ruby Akuda
found a ladder

25:04.737 --> 25:07.774
and climbed over
that wall around your heart.

25:07.907 --> 25:10.009
- It's not a wall. Mm-mm.

25:10.142 --> 25:11.343
It's a moat.

25:14.681 --> 25:16.182
- Anything I can do to help?

25:16.315 --> 25:19.218
- You can pour me another.

25:19.351 --> 25:22.454
- I can do that.

25:33.499 --> 25:39.939

- Got enough for me?

27:53.139 --> 27:54.673
- Take it.

But if it's money you want,
I'm not giving you any.

27:56.843 --> 27:59.445
- Hey.
Who paid to fix those teeth?

27:59.578 --> 28:01.047
-
- Me.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.414
Who got you off the sweets,

28:02.548 --> 28:05.184
taught you what a salad
is, huh?

28:05.317 --> 28:06.986
Yeah,
I whipped you into shape.

28:07.119 --> 28:11.657
And now the bill is coming due,
Christine Collins,

28:11.791 --> 28:15.094
with your big life
and your fancy friends.

28:15.227 --> 28:16.863
- You don't know anything
about my life.

28:16.996 --> 28:19.165
- I know you're ashamed
of who you really are.

28:19.298 --> 28:22.034
Trailer park hick
with a trailer park hick mom.

28:22.168 --> 28:23.535
- Don't you talk about her!

28:23.669 --> 28:25.738
- You're gonna take care
of me, Crystal Joe.

28:25.872 --> 28:27.706
- No!
- Or I'll make sure

28:27.840 --> 28:29.575
everybody knows you're nothing.
- Shut up.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.410
- Then again, maybe your life's
as empty as you are.

28:31.543 --> 28:34.113
Just a pretty little
made-for-TV package,

28:34.246 --> 28:37.750
but unwrap it,
and nothing there.

28:37.884 --> 28:41.353
- I am a successful, powerful,
happy woman!

28:41.487 --> 28:44.490
- No! You just play one on TV.

28:47.593 --> 28:48.795
- Aah!

28:53.532 --> 28:55.401
- Stop pretending.

28:55.534 --> 28:58.704
After 50 years, I know how you
breathe when you're asleep.

29:00.973 --> 29:03.075
Well, now we know why
we didn't do drugs

29:03.209 --> 29:06.145
last time we were this age.

29:06.278 --> 29:09.849
Mmm. What was I thinking?

29:09.982 --> 29:12.084
- Mmm.

29:18.190 --> 29:20.392
Hey, come here, baby.
Come here for sec.

29:20.526 --> 29:22.328
Come closer. Come on now.

29:22.461 --> 29:23.796
- I'm comin'.

29:27.499 --> 29:29.969
- When we met,

29:30.102 --> 29:33.405
you had a--a friend, a...

29:33.539 --> 29:36.508
a close friend.

29:38.744 --> 29:41.580
- Meredith?
- Yeah.

29:41.713 --> 29:44.250
Yeah, and then one day,
seemed like she just...

29:44.383 --> 29:46.385
disappeared.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.523
- Yeah, well, we, uh,
we grew apart, so--

29:51.657 --> 29:55.161
-
Stop pretending.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.662
After 50 years, I know when

29:56.795 --> 29:59.065
you're not telling me
the truth.

30:02.101 --> 30:03.569
You loved her.
- Mel.

30:03.702 --> 30:04.937
- Ruby...

30:06.738 --> 30:08.274
All this time, and I feel like

30:08.407 --> 30:10.476
I'm just understanding
who you are and...

30:13.112 --> 30:15.114
I feel like a fool.

30:15.247 --> 30:19.085
- You are not a fool.

30:19.218 --> 30:22.554
50 years ago, I made a choice.

30:22.688 --> 30:27.359
I chose you and the life
that we would build together.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.328
I wouldn't trade that
for the world.

30:29.461 --> 30:31.030
- Yeah, but you don't--

30:34.300 --> 30:37.904
You don't love me
the way that I love you.

30:38.037 --> 30:41.240
- But I do love you, Mel.

30:43.442 --> 30:44.443
You--

30:47.079 --> 30:49.481
You're the finest person
I've ever known.

30:51.783 --> 30:56.522
And you filled my life
with so much joy.

30:56.655 --> 31:02.828
And I will keep loving you
until my last breath.

31:02.962 --> 31:05.131
Do you hear me?

31:41.267 --> 31:44.370
- You made it just in time
for your parting feast.

31:44.503 --> 31:46.905
- I did something awful.
- I think we finally know

31:47.039 --> 31:49.408
what will satisfy your hunger.

31:51.310 --> 31:53.812
This should hit the spot.

31:56.882 --> 32:02.521
<i>* *</i>

32:02.654 --> 32:05.124
- Landon?

32:17.903 --> 32:21.273
<i>* *</i>

32:21.407 --> 32:23.142
- It's kind of early
for a swim.

32:32.751 --> 32:36.888
- I keep telling myself
to swim out and keep going.

32:37.023 --> 32:42.094
But, you know,
I--I can't make myself do it.

32:42.228 --> 32:44.863
Truth is I...

32:44.997 --> 32:47.633
I was never planning
on coming back from this trip.

32:47.766 --> 32:51.170
I said my goodbyes, 'cause
after this, it's just pain.

32:51.303 --> 32:56.442
And more pain and, uh...

32:56.575 --> 32:58.477
Hmm.

32:58.610 --> 33:00.679
Do you have a family?

33:00.812 --> 33:02.648
- I have a big family.
- Oh.

33:02.781 --> 33:06.252
- Yes.
But I--I haven't seen them

33:06.385 --> 33:08.287
in a really long time.

33:09.888 --> 33:12.191
- Well, I bet this job
doesn't stop

33:12.324 --> 33:14.193
for birthdays
or holidays, does it?

33:14.326 --> 33:18.064
- Not exactly.
- And I bet that's hard.

33:18.197 --> 33:20.332
- It can be.

33:20.466 --> 33:22.868
The Island chose me
for this role.

33:23.001 --> 33:26.705
- You didn't want it?
- I tried to say no.

33:26.838 --> 33:31.743
I was young. I was in love.
I...

33:31.877 --> 33:33.379
I'm sorry, 'cause I don't
usually

33:33.512 --> 33:35.447
talk about myself at all.

33:35.581 --> 33:37.149
- Must be the company.

33:37.283 --> 33:40.219
- No, no, actually,
I don't think so.

33:42.554 --> 33:47.226
No complaints. I have
the best job in the world.

33:47.359 --> 33:48.994
And I live in paradise.

33:49.128 --> 33:51.963
- Oh, you sure do.

33:52.098 --> 33:55.401
I'd love to stay
a little longer, in fact.

33:55.534 --> 34:00.172
But I--I got some dying to do.

34:00.306 --> 34:02.074
- Ruby--
- No, no, no, no.

34:02.208 --> 34:08.580
It's all right, really.
You know, I've had a good run.

34:09.748 --> 34:13.685
You know, if I were brave,
I'd spare Mel what's coming.

34:13.819 --> 34:18.757
You know, I just--
I've never been brave.

34:18.890 --> 34:23.695
Strong, yes. But not brave.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.471
- Well, there are many ways
to be brave

34:32.604 --> 34:35.141
and many opportunities
for bravery.

34:37.409 --> 34:41.079
That just...
isn't the right one for you.

34:46.485 --> 34:48.520
Come on.

34:48.654 --> 34:50.122
I'll walk you back, all right?

34:50.256 --> 34:52.090
- All right.

35:00.199 --> 35:01.467
- Mmm.

35:03.935 --> 35:08.240
Mmm. Mmm!

35:16.948 --> 35:18.717
Hello?
<i>- Good morning.</i>

35:18.850 --> 35:20.986
<i>Would you like breakfast
in your room this morning?</i>

35:21.119 --> 35:24.656
- Breakfast. No, thank you.
I'm--

35:27.058 --> 35:29.127
I'm not hungry.

35:36.668 --> 35:38.704
- Oh, great. You're here.

35:38.837 --> 35:40.272
Thank you so much
for meeting me.

35:40.406 --> 35:42.174
- Oh, okay.
- You know, the work that I do

35:42.308 --> 35:44.976
as a steward of this island
is--is an honor.

35:45.110 --> 35:46.712
I help people.

35:46.845 --> 35:49.981
I transform their lives
always for the better.

35:50.115 --> 35:52.251
You know, in the past,
people in my position,

35:52.384 --> 35:57.189
they have had a second,
a right hand.

35:57.323 --> 36:01.793
Ruby, I would like to
invite you

36:01.927 --> 36:05.030
to stay on Fantasy Island.

36:08.467 --> 36:10.035
- You--you'd like to what?

36:10.168 --> 36:12.904
- And you will remain
just as you are, healthy,

36:13.038 --> 36:16.308
strong, young, beautiful.

36:16.442 --> 36:19.711
Your tattoo.
What made you choose it?

36:19.845 --> 36:23.148
- I--I don't know.
I was drawn to it.

36:23.282 --> 36:26.852
- You know, it's an island
symbol of rebirth.

36:26.985 --> 36:29.888
It's reserved only to those
who hold the position

36:30.021 --> 36:31.723
that I'm offering you.

36:31.857 --> 36:35.227
I truly believe the Island
was speaking to you and to me.

36:36.862 --> 36:38.530
Well, why would the Island
speak to me?

36:38.664 --> 36:42.868
- You know, this island
is endlessly mysterious.

36:43.001 --> 36:45.203
But also, it's usually right.

36:48.374 --> 36:52.978
- Well, what do you think?
Could we?

36:53.111 --> 36:58.850
- I, uh... I think
it's a one-person offer, honey.

37:09.895 --> 37:12.798
- Well, then no.
- Ruby, on Fantasy Island,

37:12.931 --> 37:15.734
you know, honor
is balanced by--by sacrifice.

37:15.867 --> 37:19.037
- No, no. Absolutely not.

37:19.170 --> 37:23.241
How could you even ask me this?
What is wrong with you?

37:23.375 --> 37:26.512
- Yes. Yes, she'll stay.

37:26.645 --> 37:29.615
- No, you do not speak for me,
Mel Akuda.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.049
- Now don't be crazy.

37:31.182 --> 37:32.918
- No, I'm not gonna
talk about this.

37:33.051 --> 37:35.253
- Hey, we can tell the kids
that--that you didn't make it,

37:35.387 --> 37:36.588
that the trip was too much.

37:36.722 --> 37:41.427
- No! What?!
- Ruby, look at me.

37:41.560 --> 37:44.396
We both know that
you're gonna leave me soon.

37:44.530 --> 37:47.666
- Not like this I'm--
- Hey, hey, hey.

37:47.799 --> 37:53.038
You lived your whole life
for me, for our family.

37:53.171 --> 37:56.575
It's your turn now.

37:56.708 --> 37:59.277
Now, Ms. Roarke, she's--she's
offering you the opportunity

37:59.411 --> 38:04.383
at a whole new life
for yourself.

38:04.516 --> 38:07.285
And you can be yourself,
your whole self.

38:07.419 --> 38:10.622
I couldn't live with myself
if I let you pass that up.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.092
- Ruby...

38:16.662 --> 38:20.198
I'm offering you
an opportunity to be brave.

38:24.069 --> 38:30.976
<i>* *</i>

38:42.120 --> 38:44.122
- Good morning.
-

38:44.255 --> 38:49.695
I had the strangest
weekend of my life.

38:49.828 --> 38:53.064
Thank you.
- You're so welcome.

38:53.198 --> 38:57.803
- I feel liberated
and a little confused.

38:57.936 --> 38:59.204
Last night--

38:59.337 --> 39:03.875
- At the pig roast?
- The pig roast.

39:06.311 --> 39:11.850
I woke up and I thought--um,
it's hard to explain.

39:11.983 --> 39:14.019
- Christine, I want to tell
you,

39:14.152 --> 39:16.855
after you came to my office,
I looked into your stepfather.

39:16.988 --> 39:20.358
His death certificate says
that Landon Green died in 2012.

39:22.828 --> 39:26.832
- But he was here.
- His cruelty certainly was.

39:26.965 --> 39:30.268
And you've been holding onto
that since you were a child.

39:30.969 --> 39:33.705
- I think I finally let it go.

39:33.839 --> 39:36.508
You could even say
I devoured it.

39:37.443 --> 39:39.244
The cruelest thing he ever did
was to make me forget

39:39.377 --> 39:43.181
how much my mom loved me.
But I remember that now.

39:43.314 --> 39:45.717
- So what are you going to
do now with this new freedom?

39:45.851 --> 39:47.786
- First of all,
I'm gonna invite the girls

39:47.919 --> 39:51.022
from work to dragon rolls!

39:51.156 --> 39:54.426
And then, gosh, I've just spent
so many years of my life

39:54.560 --> 39:56.528
trying to please other people,

39:56.662 --> 39:59.565
I think I'm gonna work on
being happy, for real.

39:59.698 --> 40:01.066
Not just on TV.

40:01.199 --> 40:03.034
- Safe travels, Christine.

40:16.114 --> 40:20.151
- No. No, no.
This--this--this isn't right.

40:20.285 --> 40:23.088
You're not supposed
to leave me, okay?

40:23.221 --> 40:26.091
- You're gonna have
another wonderful life.

40:26.224 --> 40:27.759
Promise me.

40:31.597 --> 40:34.533
I'm the luckiest man
in the world.

40:34.666 --> 40:36.267
Okay.

40:48.146 --> 40:50.348
- Wait, wait!

41:12.103 --> 41:19.010
<i>* *</i>

41:39.765 --> 41:46.672
<i>* *</i>

42:10.128 --> 42:13.632
- So what happens now?

42:13.765 --> 42:16.401
- The unexpected.
