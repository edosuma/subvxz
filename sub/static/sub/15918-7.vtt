WEBVTT

00:02.237 --> 00:03.370
I love you.

00:03.404 --> 00:05.105
But I can't be in
this relationship.

00:05.216 --> 00:07.217
So that's it, we're done?

00:07.252 --> 00:10.054
You are 19 having
your second baby.

00:10.088 --> 00:11.956
You have no job and you live
with your grandparents.

00:11.990 --> 00:15.326
Look, I love Niecy and I'm
gonna be there for her baby.

00:15.360 --> 00:18.028
I think they should come
live with me full-time.

00:18.063 --> 00:19.797
John is the better parent.

00:19.831 --> 00:22.499
There's a story breaking
about Terrence Mitchell

00:22.534 --> 00:24.435
involving the prison
exposÃ© he wrote.

00:24.469 --> 00:26.470
Terrence is being
accused of journalistic fraud.

00:26.504 --> 00:28.806
Maybe I embellished
a few details.

00:28.840 --> 00:31.442
Everything you've accomplished
has been compromised.

00:31.476 --> 00:33.444
We did reach out to
Terrence Mitchell to come on

00:33.478 --> 00:35.370
and give his side of the
story, but he declined.

00:41.019 --> 00:42.886
Hey...
Niecy.

00:44.489 --> 00:45.889
Auntie.

00:45.924 --> 00:47.791
Look what I got.

00:47.826 --> 00:50.594
Yeah, I'm not really
into guilt gifts.

00:50.628 --> 00:53.464
Oh, come on, Niecy.

00:53.498 --> 00:55.132
Seriously?

00:57.135 --> 00:57.868
What?

00:57.902 --> 01:00.070
Remember this?

01:00.105 --> 01:02.206
Buying dresses for
Romero's wedding

01:02.240 --> 01:05.376
and you told me you
wanted to be a lawyer.

01:05.410 --> 01:08.078
You told me that you
wanted a house full of kids.

01:08.113 --> 01:10.748
Yeah, well, I got the house,
you got the kids.

01:18.723 --> 01:20.557
Calm down a little bit, quiet.

01:23.928 --> 01:27.965
I'm sorry I was being
so hard on you.

01:27.999 --> 01:30.067
You know, I just...

01:30.101 --> 01:33.437
I was wrong.

01:33.471 --> 01:35.172
I spent so much
time fussing at you

01:35.206 --> 01:36.540
about what you were gonna
do with your life,

01:36.574 --> 01:40.444
that I didn't take one
second to celebrate this baby

01:40.478 --> 01:43.080
and I'm sorry.

01:45.383 --> 01:49.286
Thank you.

01:49.320 --> 01:53.624
She wasn't a mistake, you know?

01:53.658 --> 01:55.526
You mean, you tried
to get pregnant?

01:55.560 --> 01:58.595
More like I didn't try not to.

01:59.898 --> 02:01.098
But Auntie...

02:01.132 --> 02:03.834
Her dad being Filipino,

02:03.868 --> 02:05.636
means something.

02:05.670 --> 02:07.438
Okay, you lost me.

02:07.472 --> 02:08.972
Come on.

02:09.007 --> 02:13.377
She's gonna be half
Filipino, half black.

02:13.411 --> 02:16.246
That means she's
gonna be pretty.

02:16.281 --> 02:19.716
She's gonna have
light skin and good hair

02:19.751 --> 02:23.253
and an easier life.

02:23.288 --> 02:24.721
Oh, God...

02:24.756 --> 02:26.757
Please don't lecture me.

02:26.791 --> 02:28.992
Niecy, you're beautiful.

02:29.027 --> 02:30.294
Oh, God.

02:30.328 --> 02:32.396
They would pay good
money for your skin

02:32.430 --> 02:35.833
and your... your eyes,
your smile.

02:35.867 --> 02:38.302
Please, Auntie, you don't
think I know what it means

02:38.336 --> 02:42.606
when people say that I have a
nice smile and nice eyes?

02:42.640 --> 02:46.243
Niecy, you're beautiful.

02:46.277 --> 02:49.813
Ain't no man ever fall for me.

02:49.848 --> 02:53.817
No, but they keep
coming back, don't they?

02:53.852 --> 02:56.286
That's because I put it down.

02:56.321 --> 02:58.388
No, no, don't...
say in the bedroom.

02:58.423 --> 03:02.259
In the bedroom,
in the car, movie theater.

03:02.293 --> 03:05.229
I've probably done things that
you never even heard of,

03:05.263 --> 03:07.831
being honest.
Okay, Niecy, just...

03:07.866 --> 03:10.200
Stop, I... I can't.

03:15.607 --> 03:17.641
You asked me what happened.

03:21.146 --> 03:23.213
Do you really wanna know?

03:27.986 --> 03:33.123
I grew up.

03:33.158 --> 03:37.394
I looked around.

03:37.428 --> 03:42.099
And I was finally
real with myself.

03:42.133 --> 03:45.502
I'm just saying.

03:45.537 --> 03:49.907
I want for my baby to have

03:49.941 --> 03:55.112
every possible opportunity...

03:55.146 --> 04:01.018
Because in this world
pretty is it.

04:01.052 --> 04:04.121
Then look at me.
Oh, baby...

04:04.155 --> 04:06.356
Baby, you are so beautiful.

04:06.391 --> 04:08.859
I wish you knew it.

04:08.893 --> 04:11.595
If you could only see...

04:11.629 --> 04:14.064
You have to say that,
though, you're my Auntie.

04:14.098 --> 04:16.433
No, no.

04:16.466 --> 04:19.570
I'm saying it...

04:19.603 --> 04:22.539
because it's true.

04:22.574 --> 04:23.740
And I love your hair.

04:23.775 --> 04:28.412
It's not mine.
And neither's mine.

04:28.446 --> 04:30.747
Well, I think I'm ready
for my guilt gifts.

04:32.750 --> 04:36.153
Girl, you were ready when my
ass walked through the door.

04:36.187 --> 04:40.123
Oh, baby.

04:40.158 --> 04:42.960
Can you stay the night?

04:42.994 --> 04:44.695
Of course.

Oh, hey, good morning.

06:19.357 --> 06:21.725
Hey.

06:21.759 --> 06:23.427
Ooh.

06:23.461 --> 06:25.762
I had a dream about
my baby girl last night.

06:25.797 --> 06:26.897
Yeah?

06:26.931 --> 06:29.299
She's beautiful.

06:29.334 --> 06:30.467
Pick out a name yet?

06:30.501 --> 06:32.002
Oh, I didn't tell you?
Unh-unh.

06:32.036 --> 06:35.072
I think we're gonna go
with Dantaysha.

06:37.275 --> 06:40.777
Man, the ghetto jokes
get you every time.

06:40.812 --> 06:44.681
You are so bourgey.
Girl, whatever.

06:44.716 --> 06:45.582
All right.

06:45.616 --> 06:46.917
Hey.

06:46.951 --> 06:47.818
I'm glad we did this.

06:47.852 --> 06:49.019
Me too.

06:52.657 --> 06:54.191
All right, bye, Mom.

06:54.225 --> 06:55.225
Oh, Pauletta.

06:55.259 --> 06:56.493
Looks like you're
gonna have to drive me

06:56.527 --> 06:58.929
to the doctor's appointment
'cause your brother forgot.

06:58.963 --> 07:00.931
Mom, I'm on my way to
work, where's PJ?

07:00.965 --> 07:03.100
Wait... PJ!

07:03.134 --> 07:04.401
Hey, Mom, you ready?

07:04.435 --> 07:06.737
Uh, been ready.

07:06.771 --> 07:07.938
Thought you weren't coming.

07:07.972 --> 07:10.107
What? What'd you call me for?

07:10.116 --> 07:11.675
I thought Mom needed a
ride to her appointment

07:11.709 --> 07:13.877
but Patrick's here.
I'm on time.

07:13.911 --> 07:15.679
You can never be too early.

07:15.713 --> 07:18.448
Mom, I know you're not happy
I moved out, but...

07:18.483 --> 07:19.950
I got you something.

07:19.984 --> 07:20.951
Oh.

07:20.985 --> 07:21.952
What is it?

07:21.986 --> 07:23.820
Open it.

07:27.358 --> 07:29.960
Oh, what is it?

07:29.994 --> 07:32.662
A Life Alert necklace.

07:32.697 --> 07:35.699
Now you can feel safe no matter
where you are in the house.

07:35.733 --> 07:38.068
Are you out of your mind?

07:38.102 --> 07:39.803
I'm not wearing this damn thing,

07:39.837 --> 07:43.507
this is for old people
who live alone.

07:43.541 --> 07:46.376
But... Mom.
Ridiculous.

07:46.411 --> 07:50.080
Life Alert.

07:50.114 --> 07:52.048
Ridiculous.

07:53.351 --> 07:54.584
Really?

07:54.619 --> 07:56.180
Come on, I still think
it's a good idea.

08:02.226 --> 08:04.261
All right, all right, all right.

08:04.295 --> 08:07.197
All right, you guys. Come
with me, come with me.

08:07.231 --> 08:09.332
Hey, Mary Jane, Mary Jane.

08:09.367 --> 08:10.567
Mary Jane!

08:10.601 --> 08:12.068
Hey, Mary Jane, care to
comment on Terrence Mitchell...

08:12.103 --> 08:13.904
No comment!

08:13.938 --> 08:15.572
One of the most respected activists
in the country? No comment at this time.

08:15.606 --> 08:17.374
You must know what happened.
Open up.

08:17.408 --> 08:19.075
Did you see what happened...
No comment.

08:19.110 --> 08:22.012
Is Terrence Mitchell...
do you know what happened?

08:22.046 --> 08:23.814
What's going on?

08:23.848 --> 08:25.882
Terrence Mitchell
committed suicide.

08:25.917 --> 08:27.684
Mary Jane?
Just go.

08:27.718 --> 08:28.618
Okay, okay, okay.

08:28.653 --> 08:30.987
Let's get out of here.
Okay.

08:32.722 --> 08:36.493
You and Terrence Mitchell had a
long-term relationship for many years.

08:36.527 --> 08:39.696
There's been a lot of talk
that you have been paid off

08:39.730 --> 08:42.065
by the Correctional
Facilities Federation.

08:42.099 --> 08:43.299
No, that's ridiculous.

08:43.333 --> 08:47.070
I came forward because it
was the right thing to do.

08:47.104 --> 08:49.239
I care about Terrence.

08:49.273 --> 08:53.777
Yeah, I am still very unclear
about your motivation here.

08:53.811 --> 08:56.279
Just listen to the tape.

08:56.314 --> 08:58.415
Listen, I know he
is your friend.

08:58.449 --> 09:01.785
But I am not the one who lied.

09:07.291 --> 09:08.725
There's nothing there.

09:08.759 --> 09:10.460
And let's not forget
Terrence Mitchell

09:10.495 --> 09:13.663
did commit journalistic fraud.

09:13.698 --> 09:16.066
The Mitchell family has no case.

09:16.100 --> 09:18.401
But what we don't wanna do

09:18.436 --> 09:22.172
is to give the plaintiff
any ammunition to make it seem

09:22.206 --> 09:25.976
that Miss Paul released this
news with malicious intent.

09:26.010 --> 09:30.313
Simply put, Miss Paul
should make no statements

09:30.348 --> 09:32.816
pertaining to Terrence Mitchell
until the matter's settled.

09:32.850 --> 09:34.985
I agree.

09:35.019 --> 09:38.922
Well, I'm glad you
all agree, but I don't.

09:38.956 --> 09:40.557
Terrence Mitchell was my friend.

09:40.591 --> 09:43.660
And, on top of that,
I covered this story.

09:43.694 --> 09:45.996
His death deserves an
immediate response.

09:46.030 --> 09:47.364
Mary Jane, I hear you.

09:47.398 --> 09:48.698
Are you hearing me?

09:48.733 --> 09:50.901
But I'm going to overrule
you on this.

09:50.935 --> 09:52.702
We have to put
this lawsuit to bed.

09:52.737 --> 09:56.540
After that, you can give
your statement.

09:56.574 --> 09:59.242
Okay, well, the longer
we all remain silent,

09:59.277 --> 10:01.111
the more culpable I look.

10:01.145 --> 10:02.112
Are you kidding?

10:02.146 --> 10:04.548
This thing's gonna
blow over in a week.

10:04.582 --> 10:07.350
I'm just more frustrated that we can't
capitalize on this frenzy for ratings.

10:07.385 --> 10:11.454
Okay.
So until told otherwise,

10:11.489 --> 10:13.990
you are to maintain a
cone of silence

10:14.025 --> 10:17.060
surrounding anything
concerning Terrence Mitchell.

10:21.332 --> 10:23.400
Are we clear?

10:42.162 --> 10:44.297
Let's see...

10:44.331 --> 10:46.299
How could this get any worse?

10:46.393 --> 10:50.697
Are there any more doughnuts
in the break room?

10:50.731 --> 10:55.235
Greg just told me
they're pulling "Talk Back."

10:55.269 --> 10:58.204
They want me off the air?

10:58.239 --> 11:00.173
Kara, they want me off the air.

11:00.207 --> 11:02.575
He just said I couldn't
talk about Terrence.

11:02.610 --> 11:03.710
Now I can't talk at all.

11:03.744 --> 11:05.778
It's temporary, MJ.

11:05.813 --> 11:09.148
Mark is gonna cover for you,
he's gonna be on for two hours.

11:09.183 --> 11:11.351
And Greg thinks it's a smart
way to re-launch his show.

11:11.385 --> 11:16.356
Oh, oh, that's great, okay,
well, who covers for you?

11:16.390 --> 11:18.892
You are the one who pressed me to
have Rayna on in the first place.

11:18.926 --> 11:21.427
Now I'm benched, and
you're still in the game?

11:21.462 --> 11:23.796
Our team broke a story,

11:23.831 --> 11:26.633
a story which happens
to be true, by the way.

11:26.667 --> 11:27.800
I know this is painful.

11:27.835 --> 11:30.403
But if we hadn't exposed
the truth about Terrence,

11:30.437 --> 11:31.537
someone else would have.

11:31.572 --> 11:33.539
Maybe we should've let them.

11:33.574 --> 11:35.575
You know this isn't me, MJ.

11:35.609 --> 11:36.876
No, no-no,
you know what?

11:36.911 --> 11:40.947
You're absolutely right,
this is a team effort.

11:40.981 --> 11:43.149
Only I'm the only
one on the sidelines

11:43.183 --> 11:45.285
and you'll be working
on Mark's show.

11:45.319 --> 11:47.987
Works out beautiful for everyone...
oh, right, except for me.

11:48.022 --> 11:49.956
Here we are.
No, that's nonsense.

11:49.990 --> 11:52.671
Listen to me, I know you don't
want to hear this right now. I don't.

11:52.693 --> 11:54.560
But we just need
to keep our heads down

11:54.595 --> 11:56.229
and ride this thing out.

11:56.263 --> 11:58.765
I'm sorry, which "we"
are you talking about?

11:58.799 --> 12:00.600
I'm confused.

12:18.252 --> 12:19.185
Hey.

12:20.454 --> 12:21.888
Oh, brother...

12:21.922 --> 12:23.456
What are you guys watching?

12:23.490 --> 12:26.059
Turn it off.
No, no.

12:26.093 --> 12:27.727
Let it play.

12:27.761 --> 12:28.995
And she praised him
for that, Keli,

12:29.029 --> 12:30.797
gave him a forum to
discuss his platform.

12:30.831 --> 12:32.498
Yeah, and then when he made a
mistake, she put her foot

12:32.533 --> 12:34.400
on the throat of his career
to try to advance her own.

12:34.435 --> 12:36.936
She's just reporting the news.

12:36.971 --> 12:38.137
You call it what you want
to, the bottom line is,

12:38.172 --> 12:40.373
a man is dead,
his reputation tarnished,

12:40.407 --> 12:42.675
and all at the hands of
a so-called friend.

12:53.354 --> 12:56.089
That's a good-looking
lunch.

12:56.123 --> 12:57.256
Want some?

12:57.291 --> 12:58.791
Oh,
no-no-no-no.

12:58.826 --> 13:01.928
It's too early for me
to have sweets.

13:01.962 --> 13:04.197
Aren't you lactose intolerant?

13:04.231 --> 13:05.932
Not today.

13:05.966 --> 13:08.434
Well, make sure you light a
candle when you're done, baby.

13:23.751 --> 13:28.221
You wanna tell me what's
going on with you?

13:28.255 --> 13:32.492
Dad, why haven't you
talked to me about Terrence?

13:32.526 --> 13:35.895
I mean, you disapprove, but...

13:35.929 --> 13:39.999
Do you know how hard
that was for me?

13:40.034 --> 13:42.235
He was my friend.

13:42.269 --> 13:43.469
Was he?

13:46.407 --> 13:51.310
Would he have done that to you?

13:51.345 --> 13:53.179
The way I grew up,
we were taught

13:53.213 --> 13:55.915
at a very young age
to stick together.

13:55.949 --> 13:58.785
It was ingrained in us.

13:58.819 --> 14:01.387
That it was never a level
playing field.

14:01.422 --> 14:04.524
And we had to bend the rules

14:04.558 --> 14:07.960
in order to get things done.

14:07.995 --> 14:11.664
Hopefully, we've
evolved some as a nation.

14:12.896 --> 14:14.376
Yeah, well, I know we
live in that era

14:14.401 --> 14:19.572
of hope and change
but sometimes it...

14:19.606 --> 14:24.310
sometimes it feels the same.

14:24.344 --> 14:26.312
Pauletta, at the end of
the day, it doesn't matter

14:26.346 --> 14:28.815
what I think or what
anyone thinks.

14:28.849 --> 14:32.452
It's your life.

14:32.486 --> 14:33.719
Right?

14:49.536 --> 14:52.205
You wanna tell me why you're
not wearing your new necklace?

14:55.442 --> 14:58.244
Come on, Mom, you didn't
even crack a smile.

14:58.278 --> 14:59.645
It's not funny.

14:59.680 --> 15:02.148
You're right,
you're right, it's not.

15:02.182 --> 15:02.815
It's hilarious.

15:07.354 --> 15:09.222
Mom, you need to laugh.

15:09.256 --> 15:10.823
Laugh.

15:10.858 --> 15:15.161
Junior, you don't
know how sick I am.

15:15.195 --> 15:18.064
I can't sleep, I can't eat.

15:18.098 --> 15:22.135
I can't even walk down the
stairs without losing my breath.

15:22.169 --> 15:26.439
And these damn doctors got me
on all this medication.

15:26.473 --> 15:30.209
And it's not doing a
thing, not a damn thing.

15:30.244 --> 15:32.411
All it's doing is taking
out my hair.

15:36.517 --> 15:38.918
Mom, have you ever tried, um...

15:38.952 --> 15:40.753
marijuana?

15:40.787 --> 15:45.191
Boy, now don't talk crazy
in my presence.

15:45.225 --> 15:46.726
I'm serious, okay.

15:46.760 --> 15:49.795
Look, a lot of folks your
age take it as a sleep aid,

15:49.830 --> 15:51.898
a eating aid.

15:51.932 --> 15:53.900
Doctors prescribe
it all the time.

15:53.934 --> 15:55.401
Um-hmm,
for hippies.

15:55.435 --> 15:58.404
And guess what, it'll
even make you laugh.

15:58.438 --> 16:03.142
Junior, I'm not
using illicit drugs.

16:03.177 --> 16:06.412
Okay, Mom, you gotta
get with the times.

16:06.446 --> 16:08.748
Legislation just
passed it in Colorado.

16:08.782 --> 16:10.950
They just passed it
in Washington.

16:10.984 --> 16:14.086
You know, California's
ahead of everybody.

16:14.121 --> 16:16.589
Look, people are even growing
it in their own back yards,

16:16.623 --> 16:18.758
in their gardens.

16:18.792 --> 16:23.062
I could never inhale.

16:23.096 --> 16:25.231
Wait, you smoked before?

16:25.265 --> 16:28.668
Boy...
Okay, all right.

16:28.702 --> 16:32.238
All right, um... then you
can take it as an edible.

16:32.272 --> 16:37.443
They come in cookies, brownies,
lollipops, you name it.

16:37.477 --> 16:40.746
They'd never suspect that.
See?

16:40.781 --> 16:43.282
But I wouldn't wanna
gain any weight.

16:43.317 --> 16:47.486
Well, there are a
few healthier options.

16:47.521 --> 16:49.589
You like bran muffins, right?

16:49.623 --> 16:52.592
Now how you gonna do all this?

16:52.626 --> 16:54.760
Don't worry about it, okay?

16:54.795 --> 16:57.396
I know a guy who knows a guy.

16:58.899 --> 17:00.700
Who knows another guy.

17:00.734 --> 17:03.469
But hey, I better get to class.

17:03.503 --> 17:06.305
Mwah, and then I
gotta get to work.

17:06.339 --> 17:07.807
Junior?
Yeah.

17:07.840 --> 17:10.843
This is between me and you.

17:10.877 --> 17:13.045
Me and you, I got you.

17:13.079 --> 17:14.946
I'll see you later.

17:17.317 --> 17:19.952
I can't be gaining
weight in here.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.813
Good morning.

17:27.896 --> 17:28.914
Good morning.

17:28.948 --> 17:31.750
Security's been through it.

17:31.785 --> 17:34.186
And hey, chin up.

17:34.220 --> 17:37.056
You and I both know
it's not true.

17:37.090 --> 17:41.026
Thanks.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.075
Critics claim that China's
no-strings attached investment

17:56.109 --> 18:00.879
has resulted in greater human
rights violations.

18:00.914 --> 18:04.383
So where is the public outcry?

18:04.417 --> 18:07.419
Well, my guess is
that it's coming.

18:07.454 --> 18:10.689
But not before the US's
dependency on foreign oil

18:10.724 --> 18:12.291
reaches a tipping point.

18:12.325 --> 18:15.160
And with China's oil companies
taking their yields

18:15.195 --> 18:16.695
off of the international market,

18:16.730 --> 18:20.599
some say that catastrophic gas
crisis in the United States

18:20.633 --> 18:23.902
is merely a matter of time.

18:23.937 --> 18:26.004
I'm Mark Bradley.

18:26.039 --> 18:29.575
And this is
the "Bradley Hour."

18:32.312 --> 18:33.245
You're out.

18:35.749 --> 18:39.852
Hey, you showed me how
to do this.

18:39.886 --> 18:42.755
I actually learned something.

18:42.789 --> 18:43.956
Your show's gonna be great.

18:43.990 --> 18:46.892
Well, thank you, but just as long
as my show isn't better than yours.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.560
Exactly.

18:48.595 --> 18:50.662
Isn't that you...

18:50.697 --> 18:54.233
So, uh... what are
you doing here?

18:54.267 --> 18:56.802
You know you
don't have to be brave.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.871
You can go shopping.

18:58.905 --> 19:01.240
Enjoy yourself.

19:01.274 --> 19:03.142
Get out of here, girl.

19:05.979 --> 19:09.681
Proud of you.

19:30.870 --> 19:32.838
Hello?

19:32.872 --> 19:33.906
Miss Mary?

19:42.081 --> 19:46.385
What's wrong with Mary?

19:46.419 --> 19:47.519
My friend died.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.755
Oh.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.657
Come, come, come.

20:27.493 --> 20:30.362
Ay-yi-yi.

20:41.674 --> 20:42.407
Hey, Patrick.

20:42.442 --> 20:43.342
Hey.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.177
Lisa moved up Niecy's surgery.

20:45.211 --> 20:48.213
- Something about not enough fluid.
- Okay, how soon?

20:48.248 --> 20:48.947
Within the hour.

20:48.982 --> 20:50.582
We're packing up the car now.

20:50.617 --> 20:51.717
All right, I'm on my way.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.252
Okay, see you there.

20:56.155 --> 20:57.115
Niecy's having her baby.

21:05.996 --> 21:08.476
- They're just gonna have to hold on.
- If we don't leave soon,

21:08.501 --> 21:10.836
Lisa's not gonna be able
to do the procedure.

21:10.870 --> 21:13.438
Which means some random-ass
doctor's gonna be operating on you.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.040
Stop being hard-headed
and let's go!

21:15.074 --> 21:16.408
Why you yelling?

21:16.442 --> 21:18.777
I'm waiting for Dante,
and that's it.

21:18.811 --> 21:21.647
So everybody can just relax.

21:21.681 --> 21:23.348
Damn it, Niecy, he's not coming.

21:23.383 --> 21:24.983
Hey, son, calm down.

21:25.018 --> 21:29.821
Hey, uh, Nyema's got Travian
so we're good there.

21:29.856 --> 21:32.157
Dante ain't coming,
my mama ain't coming?

21:32.191 --> 21:34.159
What the hell do we look like?

21:34.193 --> 21:37.162
Extras in your in your movie?

21:37.196 --> 21:40.198
Everybody just leave her alone.

21:40.233 --> 21:41.566
Let her have
the baby right here.

21:41.601 --> 21:44.136
All this is so she can
get attention.

21:44.170 --> 21:45.871
Don't give her any.

21:48.374 --> 21:50.542
Okay, fine.

21:50.576 --> 21:51.710
I'll go.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.478
That's what I thought.

21:53.513 --> 21:55.280
Get your behind up.

22:03.022 --> 22:04.723
Hi, I'm home.

22:04.757 --> 22:05.457
Hey.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.225
Hey, thanks for staying late.

22:07.260 --> 22:09.127
Sure, no problem, we had fun.

22:09.162 --> 22:12.097
Good, that's good.

22:20.039 --> 22:23.308
You got that little soldier
look going, what's going on?

22:23.343 --> 22:25.744
No hot date tonight?

22:25.778 --> 22:29.514
Oh, you know me, quick
shower, I'm good to go.

22:29.549 --> 22:31.416
I can make time.

22:33.853 --> 22:36.555
It's just work.

22:36.589 --> 22:39.791
I pushed Mary Jane to um...

22:39.826 --> 22:42.361
expose this guy's secrets
a few weeks ago

22:42.395 --> 22:45.931
and it's just all
come crashing down on us.

22:45.965 --> 22:49.835
I think I pushed her too hard.

22:49.869 --> 22:53.038
I don't know, sometimes I...

22:53.072 --> 22:55.974
I don't think she's got the
stomach for this business.

22:56.009 --> 22:58.977
Now you're having an
attack of conscience.

22:59.012 --> 23:00.779
Am I that predictable?

23:00.813 --> 23:04.916
Yeah, pretty much, I mean,
you're catholic for one thing.

23:04.951 --> 23:06.785
What does that mean?

23:06.819 --> 23:08.920
It means you have all
this self-criticism,

23:08.955 --> 23:12.324
over going for what you want.

23:12.358 --> 23:15.360
It's okay to love
your job, Kara.

23:15.395 --> 23:17.729
It's okay to be ambitious.

23:17.764 --> 23:20.132
I don't know.

23:20.166 --> 23:22.601
It ruined you and me.

23:22.635 --> 23:25.537
No, it didn't ruin us.

23:25.571 --> 23:27.773
We did.

23:27.807 --> 23:32.711
It's just easier to blame
everything on SNC sometimes.

23:32.745 --> 23:36.348
Am I really that ambitious?

23:36.382 --> 23:41.153
Where most people hear no
you hear try harder.

23:41.187 --> 23:44.222
I mean, you got places to go.

23:44.257 --> 23:48.060
Do you know how envious
I am of that?

23:48.094 --> 23:51.930
Really?

23:51.964 --> 23:54.900
All I've been trying to say
is you're not a bad mom

23:54.934 --> 23:58.036
if you want me to
take the boys for a while.

23:58.071 --> 24:01.473
You can still have them each
and every weekend.

24:06.112 --> 24:08.880
I just don't wanna hurt them.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.919
I love them more than
anything in this world.

24:16.989 --> 24:19.391
More than my job.

24:21.260 --> 24:24.396
It's just that if I
don't try my hardest

24:24.430 --> 24:26.798
to make something of
myself right now,

24:26.833 --> 24:29.801
I just feel like I
don't have anything to give.

24:29.836 --> 24:35.907
Hey, hey, hey.

24:35.942 --> 24:36.442
I know.

24:40.546 --> 24:43.415
We are such a clichÃ©.

24:51.958 --> 24:53.158
Mr. Patterson?

24:53.192 --> 24:55.327
Surprise?
Get your things.

24:55.361 --> 24:56.495
Niecy's having the baby.

24:56.529 --> 24:57.829
She wants you there.

24:57.864 --> 25:00.265
I told her she don't need me
for this, I'm not going.

25:00.299 --> 25:01.166
Oh, you going.

25:04.670 --> 25:06.438
Excuse me, are
you Dante's mother?

25:06.472 --> 25:07.572
Yes.

25:07.607 --> 25:08.773
I'm Patrick Patterson.

25:08.808 --> 25:10.208
Our children know each other.

25:10.243 --> 25:11.643
I really need to speak with you.

25:11.677 --> 25:14.746
Please, come on, Dante, don't
be rude, invite them inside.

25:16.916 --> 25:19.184
You have to take off your shoes.

25:19.218 --> 25:20.886
House rule.

25:20.920 --> 25:25.223
You lucky your mom here.

25:25.258 --> 25:27.959
What can I do for
you, Mr. Patterson?

25:31.030 --> 25:33.732
I take it Dante hasn't
mentioned anything?

25:33.766 --> 25:35.634
Mentioned what?

25:35.668 --> 25:38.603
There's no easy way to say this.

25:38.638 --> 25:42.807
But my daughter is pregnant
with Dante's child.

25:42.842 --> 25:46.611
Ah, no, not my son.

25:46.646 --> 25:49.948
Not my son.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.249
Either he's been lying to you,

25:51.284 --> 25:53.718
or you're in denial,
but this is happening.

25:53.753 --> 25:56.054
Dante's gonna be a father.

25:56.088 --> 25:59.524
He can't... He can't have
a baby, he's too young.

25:59.559 --> 26:03.662
You know, actually, um... your
son has two babies on the way.

26:03.696 --> 26:05.664
Oh, come on, man,
what are you doing to me.

26:05.698 --> 26:07.966
Man, she might as well
know all of it.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.035
We can continue
this discussion later.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.870
But my daughter's having
his baby right now.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.805
And he needs to be there.

26:17.043 --> 26:19.844
Dante.

26:19.879 --> 26:21.780
Dante.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.968
Oh, it's so pretty.

26:45.338 --> 26:47.839
You've seen streamers
before, I assume.

26:47.873 --> 26:48.740
Mmm...

26:48.774 --> 26:50.442
Ma, those are for later.

26:50.476 --> 26:53.445
Mmm, these are delicious.

26:53.479 --> 26:55.146
Mom.

26:56.816 --> 27:00.085
Oh, aren't these cute?

27:00.119 --> 27:01.953
It's hard to believe anyone is

27:01.988 --> 27:05.490
small enough to
even get into these.

27:05.524 --> 27:06.958
If I knew that bringing
babies in the world

27:06.993 --> 27:09.861
make you this happy, I
would've had a bunch by now.

27:09.895 --> 27:12.731
You just say so, but I
don't believe you.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.000
Give me another cookie...

27:15.034 --> 27:17.836
No, no, enough with
the cookies, Mom.

27:21.774 --> 27:23.275
Wow.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.143
You've got the munchies.

27:25.177 --> 27:27.112
No.

27:27.146 --> 27:28.213
Is she here yet?

27:28.247 --> 27:30.448
No, no, not yet.

27:30.483 --> 27:31.750
Tubal ligation, thing?

27:31.784 --> 27:33.485
That happens after.

27:33.519 --> 27:36.554
Dante.
What's up?

27:36.589 --> 27:38.590
Why don't you...

27:38.624 --> 27:40.158
drape that over something.

27:40.192 --> 27:41.359
Okay.

27:58.163 --> 28:01.432
Being a parent,
something else, right?

28:01.477 --> 28:04.513
Yes, it is, yes, it is.

28:04.551 --> 28:05.918
Thing is, it never stops.

28:05.953 --> 28:09.689
They grow up and we still
try to protect them.

28:09.723 --> 28:13.793
Dad, I feel awful about
tarnishing the Patterson name.

28:14.828 --> 28:17.830
Your name is Mary Jane Paul now.

28:17.865 --> 28:20.233
So I guess we're okay.

28:21.235 --> 28:24.003
Everyone thinks I changed
my name for my career,

28:24.037 --> 28:26.172
but really, it was
for times like these.

28:26.206 --> 28:27.974
I mean, I never wanted
you guys to suffer

28:28.008 --> 28:32.812
for anything I
came under fire for.

28:32.846 --> 28:34.313
Pauletta, you don't
know how proud

28:34.348 --> 28:37.483
I am of you every single day.

28:37.518 --> 28:39.919
I just want you to be okay.

28:45.526 --> 28:49.529
A perfect little life.

28:49.563 --> 28:51.230
No mistakes made, just perfect.

28:51.265 --> 28:57.737
Hmm... yeah, but wait till
the world get's a hold of 'em.

28:57.771 --> 29:01.674
Still... there's
nothing like it.

29:03.176 --> 29:05.177
I don't know if it's
in the cards for me, Dad.

29:05.212 --> 29:06.979
Oh, you got time.

29:07.014 --> 29:08.180
Tell my ovaries that.

29:08.215 --> 29:09.715
Oh, please...

29:12.286 --> 29:13.819
Any news?

29:13.854 --> 29:15.254
We just heard,
she's out of surgery.

29:15.289 --> 29:19.625
Should be any minute now.

29:19.660 --> 29:22.194
Well, there she is,
here she come.

29:22.229 --> 29:24.697
Oh-ho-ho.

29:24.731 --> 29:29.435
Allow me to introduce
the newest little Patterson.

29:29.469 --> 29:32.004
Wait, it's champagne time?

29:32.039 --> 29:34.874
Oh!

29:34.908 --> 29:37.944
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

29:43.517 --> 29:45.985
Happy to be a daddy,
how does it feel?

29:46.019 --> 29:48.554
Ohh...

29:48.589 --> 29:51.591
You wanna hold her?

29:54.761 --> 29:56.495
Go on.

29:57.364 --> 29:59.398
You washed your
hands first, right?

30:00.801 --> 30:02.468
Does the child have a name?

30:02.502 --> 30:04.670
Isabel Aquino.

30:04.705 --> 30:06.706
Isabel, Isabel.

30:11.278 --> 30:12.612
She got a headful of hair.

30:12.646 --> 30:15.314
Just like my dreams, Auntie.

30:15.349 --> 30:17.083
She is, she's beautiful.

30:17.117 --> 30:20.252
Okay, I'm nervous, anybody
else wanna hold her?

30:20.287 --> 30:21.454
Daddy?

30:21.488 --> 30:23.389
Uh-oh, this is
all you right here.

30:26.493 --> 30:28.060
Watch her head.

30:28.095 --> 30:29.462
Ohh...

30:35.502 --> 30:37.269
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

30:37.304 --> 30:38.404
I've been patient enough.

30:38.438 --> 30:40.640
My turn, my turn.

30:42.442 --> 30:45.411
Ohh...

30:49.316 --> 30:50.683
Auntie MJ.

30:50.717 --> 30:54.253
Paulleta with a baby.

30:54.287 --> 30:57.056
Oh, you know, you next, right?

30:57.090 --> 30:58.758
Yeah, yeah.

30:58.792 --> 31:00.660
How you holding up?

31:00.694 --> 31:03.996
It's kind of hard.

31:04.031 --> 31:08.968
It's hard being at the center of
someone's death, you know?

31:09.002 --> 31:12.104
I'm obsessed with all
the work he left behind.

31:12.139 --> 31:14.240
I've been meaning to call you.

31:14.274 --> 31:16.308
Come in, check on you.

31:16.343 --> 31:19.011
No, girl, you know,
I'm... I'm fine.

31:19.046 --> 31:20.713
People have been
calling left and right...

31:20.747 --> 31:22.882
David even called, actually.

31:22.916 --> 31:25.084
He left me the sweetest message.

31:25.118 --> 31:28.454
He did... when?

31:28.488 --> 31:30.623
Right after he heard
about Terrence.

31:30.657 --> 31:32.525
I mean, I'm...

31:32.559 --> 31:33.693
Sort of amazed that it

31:33.727 --> 31:37.329
took something so tragic
to get him to reach out, but...

31:37.364 --> 31:40.733
You think it's a sign?

31:40.767 --> 31:43.502
I guess God gives
us something to hold onto

31:43.537 --> 31:45.204
even in the worst of times.

31:45.238 --> 31:48.374
Vilma said the same thing.

31:48.408 --> 31:51.644
I guess God wants me to know
that I'm gonna be okay.

31:51.678 --> 31:55.681
Yeah, listen, I'm glad to hear
you're well, but I better go.

31:55.716 --> 31:56.816
Work, you know?

31:56.850 --> 31:59.452
Oh, right, hey.

31:59.486 --> 32:04.090
Um, thank you for taking care
of my niece and little Isabel.

32:04.124 --> 32:06.892
You're welcome, bye.

32:06.927 --> 32:08.227
Bye

32:24.711 --> 32:27.880
You an Auntie again?

32:27.914 --> 32:29.381
Did you know that?

32:29.416 --> 32:31.016
I didn't know.

32:31.051 --> 32:33.619
Hmm....

32:33.653 --> 32:38.691
Yeah, I get
confused sometimes, too.

32:38.725 --> 32:39.825
How's your mom?

32:39.860 --> 32:41.127
Good.

32:41.161 --> 32:42.828
She still mad at me?

32:42.863 --> 32:44.563
She's pretty pissed.

32:44.598 --> 32:45.197
Hmm.

32:45.232 --> 32:47.633
Dinner's ready!

32:47.667 --> 32:50.102
I have an idea.

32:54.374 --> 32:56.242
What happens if you push it?

32:56.276 --> 32:57.510
You wanna find out?

32:57.544 --> 32:59.345
No way.

32:59.379 --> 33:02.281
You won't get in trouble.

33:02.315 --> 33:07.153
Well-behaved women
seldom make history.

33:08.889 --> 33:11.056
Oh, hell.

33:14.261 --> 33:16.729
Wait...

33:16.763 --> 33:18.030
That's mom, that's her!

33:18.064 --> 33:20.699
Mom! We're coming Mom!

33:20.734 --> 33:22.201
Almost there!

33:22.235 --> 33:25.237
What's wrong, Mom?
Are you okay, did you fall?

33:25.272 --> 33:26.353
I don't know what happened?

33:26.373 --> 33:28.274
Did it accidentally go off?

33:31.144 --> 33:32.244
D'Asia.

33:33.280 --> 33:34.547
Really?

33:34.581 --> 33:36.382
Corrupting them this young?

33:38.819 --> 33:39.919
Dinner's on the table.

33:39.953 --> 33:43.556
Since you didn't exercise today, you
can get down the stairs yourself.

33:45.225 --> 33:47.693
I got ya, I got ya.

33:47.727 --> 33:49.395
You'll get yours.

33:49.429 --> 33:51.764
You gonna help
me down the stairs?

33:51.798 --> 33:52.965
Yeah.

33:56.303 --> 33:58.237
You're fast.

34:02.168 --> 34:04.293
Ava, that I love about
your "Middle of Nowhere"

34:04.383 --> 34:07.018
is that you focus
on how a life in prison

34:07.080 --> 34:08.614
affects the whole family.

34:08.702 --> 34:12.405
There's so much politics, so
many politics, so much drama.

34:12.438 --> 34:14.340
So much architecture
around the idea

34:14.373 --> 34:17.810
of the prison industrial
complex that really excludes

34:17.844 --> 34:19.946
the heart of it, which
are the families,

34:19.980 --> 34:21.447
the loved ones
who are left behind.

34:21.482 --> 34:23.549
Um, you know, I just thought it
was time that we looked at

34:23.583 --> 34:27.487
the millions, millions of
people, particularly women,

34:27.521 --> 34:29.455
mothers, daughters, sisters,
wives, who are victimized

34:29.489 --> 34:32.291
by this and the ways
in which companies

34:32.326 --> 34:33.693
actually prey upon them.

34:33.726 --> 34:35.895
Predatory phone rates,
exorbitant prices

34:35.929 --> 34:38.297
to just call
into your loved ones.

34:38.331 --> 34:42.335
Um, barriers to connection is
really what this is all about,

34:42.369 --> 34:44.103
and the fact that people are...
are getting rich

34:44.138 --> 34:49.809
on the misery of those who are
waiting, is really inexcusable.

34:49.842 --> 34:51.444
Thank you, Ava, for
coming on my show.

34:51.478 --> 34:53.880
Thank you, Mary
Jane, thanks for having me.

34:53.914 --> 34:56.415
Check out Ava's film
"Middle of Nowhere".

34:56.449 --> 34:59.318
I promise, it's time well spent.

34:59.353 --> 35:02.989
Brook to two, cue MJ's
Terrence response.

35:03.023 --> 35:05.725
Well, if you're a regular
viewer of "Talk Back"

35:05.759 --> 35:07.460
you're likely aware
of the tragic death

35:07.494 --> 35:09.862
of Terrence Mitchell.

35:09.897 --> 35:13.099
Terrence was many things.

35:13.133 --> 35:15.868
A gifted writer,
a tireless crusader,

35:15.903 --> 35:18.104
and an advocate for millions
silenced by what

35:18.138 --> 35:21.941
Michelle Alexander calls
"the new Jim Crow."

35:21.975 --> 35:23.843
He was also human.

35:23.877 --> 35:26.813
He was fallible.

35:26.847 --> 35:30.616
I was lucky to
call him a friend.

35:30.651 --> 35:32.985
I was asked to read a statement
about Terrence's suicide,

35:33.020 --> 35:34.120
something that indicated...

35:34.154 --> 35:35.621
Here comes your handiwork.

35:35.656 --> 35:37.723
...stunned by this tragedy, we
don't regret our actions

35:37.758 --> 35:39.492
here at SNC
and I, in particular,

35:39.526 --> 35:42.395
have done nothing wrong.

35:42.429 --> 35:44.130
I could read it.

35:44.164 --> 35:47.233
But I'm not sure I could look
myself in the mirror afterwards.

35:47.267 --> 35:48.534
She's off script.

35:48.569 --> 35:51.003
Kara, what's going on?

35:51.038 --> 35:52.405
While I know...

35:52.439 --> 35:56.175
MJ, I don't know where
you're going with this...

35:56.210 --> 35:58.578
She isn't supposed
to say anything.

35:58.612 --> 36:00.680
I do regret how I handled it.

36:02.850 --> 36:06.285
The discovery of some of
Terrence's research was forged

36:06.320 --> 36:09.222
left me with a moral dilemma.

36:09.256 --> 36:11.290
I knew his reputation
would be tarnished.

36:11.325 --> 36:14.861
His efforts made
futile and nobody would care

36:14.895 --> 36:21.434
about the very real issues he
devoted his life to exploring.

36:21.468 --> 36:27.106
I chose to pursue it anyway.

36:27.140 --> 36:28.380
I can't help but see a parallel

36:28.408 --> 36:31.444
between how I feel
about Terrence

36:31.478 --> 36:36.649
and our prison system itself.

36:36.683 --> 36:38.351
Yes, it's legal,

36:38.385 --> 36:41.487
but that doesn't make it right.

36:41.521 --> 36:43.823
The facts are indisputable.

36:43.857 --> 36:45.625
People of color make
up 30 percent

36:45.659 --> 36:48.461
of the general population,
yet they make up 60 percent

36:48.495 --> 36:50.396
of the population behind bars.

36:50.430 --> 36:51.910
One in three
black men in this country

36:51.932 --> 36:55.501
can expect to go to prison
in their lifetime.

36:55.535 --> 36:58.271
I say enough is enough. We have
to stop hiding behind rhetoric,

36:58.305 --> 37:00.640
legislation such as "three
strikes" and sentences

37:00.674 --> 37:04.543
based almost entirely
on the discretion of judges.

37:04.578 --> 37:07.346
If we remain indifferent
to these injustices,

37:07.381 --> 37:09.782
we as individuals are no better
than a system that has been

37:09.816 --> 37:13.486
problematic at best and
morally bankrupt at worst.

37:17.357 --> 37:21.794
Terrence Mitchell asked me
to pick up this fight.

37:21.828 --> 37:25.097
I never had the chance
to give him an answer.

37:25.132 --> 37:32.171
And Terrence, I will not let
my mistakes define me.

37:32.205 --> 37:34.941
I will no longer be silent

37:34.975 --> 37:40.446
and most of all, I want you to
know how truly sorry I am.

37:50.357 --> 37:53.793
I'm Mary Jane Paul, and
you are watching "Talk Back."

38:06.173 --> 38:08.541
And we're out.

38:13.213 --> 38:15.214
- Good job today.
- Thank you.

38:32.265 --> 38:34.633
I know you said,
"Keep your head down."

38:34.668 --> 38:37.003
I heard, "Go down swinging."

38:40.874 --> 38:43.909
You are the real thing, mama.

38:43.944 --> 38:46.912
Great.

38:46.947 --> 38:48.781
You did good.

38:48.815 --> 38:50.216
Thanks.

38:53.186 --> 38:54.887
Good job, Mary Jane.

39:16.743 --> 39:18.144
Hey.

39:18.178 --> 39:19.945
What's up?

39:19.980 --> 39:20.713
You okay?

39:20.747 --> 39:23.716
Yeah, I'm good, actually.

39:23.750 --> 39:26.519
Did you come all this
way just to check on me?

39:26.553 --> 39:28.954
Yeah.

39:28.989 --> 39:31.424
That, and I need to
ask you something.

39:31.458 --> 39:33.025
Anything, come in.

39:39.099 --> 39:42.701
What is it?

39:42.736 --> 39:46.072
Can't believe I'm
about to ask you this.

39:46.106 --> 39:51.077
Did you...

39:51.111 --> 39:53.646
Did you steal my sperm?

39:56.049 --> 39:57.593
Mmm...
