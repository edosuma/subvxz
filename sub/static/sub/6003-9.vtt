00:26.467 --> 00:28.001
Where are you going?

02:00.759 --> 02:03.594
This isn't yellow fever. This is smallpox.

02:03.595 --> 02:05.424
I know.

02:05.425 --> 02:09.461
And you didn't think this was
important information for me to have?

02:09.463 --> 02:11.463
Yellow fever is common.

02:12.799 --> 02:15.393
Rest of the world will not even notice.

02:15.394 --> 02:17.328
But smallpox,

02:17.430 --> 02:20.899
would you buy beef or coffee
beans from a country with that?

02:20.900 --> 02:23.602
But I could have brought the vaccine.

02:23.603 --> 02:25.737
Medicines.

02:25.738 --> 02:27.873
I'm equipped for the wrong disease.

02:29.876 --> 02:32.343
You will do as you're told.

02:32.512 --> 02:36.313
After all, it was your country that
caused this outbreak in the first place.

02:58.669 --> 03:00.504
Are you American?

03:01.672 --> 03:04.541
Help me. Help me.

03:12.384 --> 03:14.018
John Thackery, Philadelphia.

03:14.019 --> 03:15.751
August Robertson, New York.

03:15.752 --> 03:17.520
I know the name.

03:17.521 --> 03:19.088
What are you doing here?

03:19.089 --> 03:20.789
I'm a doctor.

03:20.790 --> 03:22.558
I was working the Mosquito Coast.

03:22.559 --> 03:24.560
They called me in for this.

03:24.728 --> 03:28.130
This is the last place I expected
to see a man from the society pages.

03:28.232 --> 03:30.733
My shipping company, they
use Nicaragua as a shortcut

03:30.767 --> 03:32.735
to the West Coast and the Orient and back.

03:32.802 --> 03:34.870
Two weeks crossing this
country saves me two months

03:34.905 --> 03:37.840
in navigation around South America.

03:37.874 --> 03:40.342
So why are they keeping you prisoner?

03:40.476 --> 03:43.846
Are you the American that's supposed
to have caused this outbreak?

03:43.947 --> 03:46.248
My shipping company pays
them in trinkets and blankets

03:46.315 --> 03:48.450
and now they're saying those
blankets made them sick.

03:48.451 --> 03:50.786
That's very possible.

03:50.787 --> 03:52.587
They killed 12 of my men.

03:52.622 --> 03:53.822
Mostly Hondurans.

03:53.890 --> 03:55.690
And they're gonna kill
me, I can assure you.

03:55.792 --> 03:57.759
Please, you've got to help me. Ah!

03:57.761 --> 03:59.527
You need to let the American go.

03:59.595 --> 04:02.964
He will pay for this disease with his life.

04:02.998 --> 04:05.133
But you can't be sure he's responsible.

04:05.134 --> 04:06.801
He stays.

04:08.637 --> 04:11.806
Well, then I won't cure these people.

04:11.840 --> 04:13.975
Then you will end up
like your American friend.

04:15.311 --> 04:16.711
If this thing spreads,

04:16.745 --> 04:18.644
it's the most contagious
thing on the Earth.

04:18.680 --> 04:21.548
You let him go, I will save these people.

04:27.489 --> 04:30.091
Without the vaccine?

04:30.092 --> 04:32.426
I have a way.

05:17.971 --> 05:19.938
These are the survivors.

05:19.972 --> 05:21.873
They can no longer get the disease.

05:21.874 --> 05:23.507
They're immune.

05:23.575 --> 05:26.510
So they can help us with
those who still have it.

05:26.578 --> 05:30.048
Tell them to wrap these
bandages around the skin.

05:30.049 --> 05:33.151
It will help their sores heal.

05:54.005 --> 05:55.839
For those who haven't gotten the disease,

05:55.840 --> 05:57.907
this will keep them safe.

05:57.909 --> 05:59.543
They'll get a mild case of it.

05:59.544 --> 06:01.778
They'll definitely recover

06:01.779 --> 06:04.013
and they'll never get it again.

06:04.014 --> 06:06.082
Even if this does work,

06:06.083 --> 06:07.884
I'm still keeping his cargo.

06:56.599 --> 06:58.599
Girls, you ready?

08:05.833 --> 08:08.601
Good morning, Dr. Gallinger.

08:11.471 --> 08:13.572
Detective.

08:13.573 --> 08:15.774
What can I do for you?

08:15.875 --> 08:19.478
I had some more information
regarding Dr. Cotton's death

08:19.512 --> 08:21.480
that you might be interested in hearing

08:21.580 --> 08:25.150
since, as you said, you and
your wife were so fond of him.

08:27.653 --> 08:29.454
Would you follow me?

08:33.159 --> 08:34.926
What is it?

08:35.028 --> 08:39.063
We've confirmed that he was
most definitely poisoned.

08:39.065 --> 08:41.899
And we now know who did it.

08:44.169 --> 08:46.103
You do?

08:46.104 --> 08:48.873
You might want to prepare yourself.

08:50.575 --> 08:52.909
It was his sons who did him in.

08:52.911 --> 08:55.112
They both were studying at Princeton

08:55.247 --> 08:58.815
and were slowly adding arsenic
to their father's meals over time.

09:02.054 --> 09:03.855
You're positive about this?

09:03.856 --> 09:05.556
They confessed it.

09:05.590 --> 09:07.591
They were surprised he had died so quickly

09:07.759 --> 09:11.295
since, as they said, they had only
been adding the arsenic a short while.

09:11.363 --> 09:13.597
Must have given him
more than they realized.

09:13.598 --> 09:15.466
Not that I blame them.

09:15.533 --> 09:19.002
From what I gather, the old man was a nut.

09:20.438 --> 09:21.872
You know that crazy man

09:21.874 --> 09:24.275
pulled the teeth out of their head.

09:26.211 --> 09:28.879
His own children's teeth.

09:28.914 --> 09:31.248
Why the hell do you do something like that?

09:33.217 --> 09:35.552
He thought it would keep them sane.

09:37.989 --> 09:40.656
Have the boys been arrested?

09:40.657 --> 09:43.859
They killed themselves before we could.

09:43.928 --> 09:47.430
So I guess Daddy's treatment
didn't work out so great.

09:49.100 --> 09:51.467
Anyway, just thought you'd want to know.

09:51.468 --> 09:53.569
Thank you.

09:53.570 --> 09:55.538
How's your wife?

09:57.474 --> 09:59.075
Doing well.

09:59.076 --> 10:01.244
Give her my best.

10:21.831 --> 10:24.132
Will you excuse us for a moment, Dudley?

10:25.868 --> 10:27.802
Thank you.

10:29.806 --> 10:31.740
Your mother said you're leaving.

10:32.875 --> 10:35.110
Going to Ohio tonight.

10:35.111 --> 10:37.379
The refinery is nearly ready.

10:37.480 --> 10:39.648
Talking with some men in
Cleveland and up near Detroit

10:39.715 --> 10:42.951
about using our gasoline
for automotive propulsion.

10:42.953 --> 10:45.320
Well, when will you be back?

10:46.722 --> 10:49.023
Do you really care?

10:49.024 --> 10:50.658
Of course.

10:50.660 --> 10:52.761
'Cause I want you to come with me.

10:52.862 --> 10:55.230
It's a part of my father's
business that could be mine.

10:55.297 --> 10:58.833
I can build it. We can make a life there.

10:58.835 --> 11:02.036
Phillip, it's a lot all at once.

11:02.037 --> 11:03.504
I need some time.

11:03.539 --> 11:06.374
No, I don't want words or protestations.

11:06.408 --> 11:09.210
It's not what you say, it's what you do.

11:09.311 --> 11:12.480
I'm leaving tonight. I
don't know when I'll be back.

11:12.515 --> 11:14.682
Now either you're coming
with me, your husband,

11:14.683 --> 11:16.584
to be with me wherever we end up,

11:16.585 --> 11:18.419
or you're not.

11:18.520 --> 11:23.024
And if you're not, I'll
find someone who wants to.

11:23.025 --> 11:25.225
I deserve at least that.

11:41.210 --> 11:43.310
May I come in?

11:51.919 --> 11:54.321
How are you doing?

11:59.894 --> 12:03.663
I'm deeply sorry, John.

12:06.367 --> 12:08.234
What did you want?

12:10.371 --> 12:13.140
Just wanted to give you
a report on the twins.

12:13.141 --> 12:15.842
Some good news for a change.

12:17.444 --> 12:20.446
Dr. Chickering and I
examined them this morning.

12:20.447 --> 12:22.514
Nika's pneumonia has receded.

12:24.317 --> 12:27.786
The amount of albumin in
their urine has decreased.

12:27.788 --> 12:30.957
They're eating full meals and...

12:30.958 --> 12:33.092
they took their first steps alone.

12:35.796 --> 12:37.363
Also, the orphanage informs me

12:37.464 --> 12:39.866
that a family from Missouri
has agreed to take the girls.

12:39.900 --> 12:41.433
They arrived in the city yesterday

12:41.501 --> 12:44.737
and are just waiting on
our approval to let them go.

12:44.738 --> 12:46.438
I think they're ready.

12:47.775 --> 12:49.775
Sounds like it.

12:53.447 --> 12:55.614
Congratulations.

13:31.350 --> 13:34.219
So, here's what I'm thinking.

13:34.220 --> 13:37.588
We start at the East Side piers.

13:37.690 --> 13:40.125
Find some sailors coming
back from a long time at sea

13:40.126 --> 13:41.727
looking to get their logs dunked.

13:41.728 --> 13:44.195
Then we head to 29th Street.

13:44.396 --> 13:47.966
They've got enough brothels and dance
halls to keep us selling till Christmas.

13:47.967 --> 13:49.935
Fine.

13:52.204 --> 13:54.705
How long you gonna be sore with me?

13:54.706 --> 13:56.874
As long as I feel like.

13:56.908 --> 13:59.544
I may not be a nun
anymore, but I took my vows,

13:59.545 --> 14:01.912
vows that you know I intend on keeping.

14:01.913 --> 14:04.215
It was one little kiss, all right?

14:04.216 --> 14:05.883
A kiss I didn't even get.

14:05.884 --> 14:07.685
You're a hound,

14:07.719 --> 14:09.820
like all them fellas getting off the boats

14:09.821 --> 14:11.856
looking to get their logs dunked.

14:11.990 --> 14:15.159
I can't trust you now just like
I shouldn't have all this time.

14:16.094 --> 14:19.531
I got carried away is all.

14:19.532 --> 14:22.166
Because what I said is true.

14:23.935 --> 14:25.836
I do have feelings for you.

14:29.374 --> 14:31.976
Then I'd ask you to please
keep them to yourself.

14:33.545 --> 14:36.613
This box is ready.

14:36.715 --> 14:39.383
Guess those vows didn't
include one of forgiveness.

14:39.384 --> 14:40.718
What?

14:40.719 --> 14:42.419
Nothing, all right? I'm sorry.

14:42.520 --> 14:45.055
I didn't mean to tempt you
into breaking your vows.

14:45.057 --> 14:47.257
Believe me, a gorilla like you,

14:47.258 --> 14:49.659
there wasn't the least bit of temptation.

15:05.409 --> 15:07.410
Mr. Jenkins.

15:07.411 --> 15:08.711
Herman Barrow.

15:08.713 --> 15:09.879
Good to meet you, Mr. Barrow.

15:09.880 --> 15:11.581
And you, sir.

15:11.582 --> 15:13.149
- Shall we?
- Yes.

15:27.063 --> 15:28.664
Thank you, Mr. Barrow.

15:28.665 --> 15:30.599
Welcome to the Metropolitan Club.

15:47.250 --> 15:49.517
I "don'ts" know what a Vander is,

15:49.518 --> 15:51.485
but I'm sho glad he done built it.

15:51.487 --> 15:53.855
Herman, how are you?

15:53.856 --> 15:55.757
I'm very well, Corky, thank you.

15:55.758 --> 15:57.158
That was a wonderful evening.

15:57.159 --> 15:58.826
Please.

15:58.827 --> 16:00.728
Oh.

16:00.829 --> 16:04.666
Well, we very much appreciated
your generous donation.

16:04.667 --> 16:06.801
Ah.

16:17.512 --> 16:19.112
Dr. Thackery?

16:21.316 --> 16:24.952
Dr. Thackery, it's Nurse Baker.

16:25.019 --> 16:27.520
The twins are leaving. I
thought you'd want to know.

16:47.641 --> 16:49.910
Where is Dr. Thackery?

16:49.911 --> 16:51.978
We want to say good-bye.

16:52.013 --> 16:53.846
I'm sure he wishes he could be here,

16:53.848 --> 16:57.450
but unfortunately he's elsewhere.

17:01.988 --> 17:03.723
Be well, girls.

17:12.366 --> 17:13.733
Finally, a good outcome.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.467
Yeah.

17:17.737 --> 17:20.939
Oh, well, I don't suppose he's rushing over

17:20.940 --> 17:23.107
for one last wave at the twins.

17:23.108 --> 17:25.009
You brought me up on charges?

17:25.010 --> 17:26.444
What?

17:26.445 --> 17:28.079
I've been called to defend myself

17:28.079 --> 17:30.081
in front of the state medical board.

17:30.082 --> 17:32.050
You sterilized idiots?

17:32.051 --> 17:33.685
Dozens.

17:33.686 --> 17:36.521
I had no idea how far outside

17:36.588 --> 17:38.455
the brotherhood of
physicians you were until now.

17:38.457 --> 17:40.190
And I had no idea how far outside you were

17:40.191 --> 17:41.859
until you sabotaged me.

17:41.860 --> 17:43.961
How?

17:43.962 --> 17:46.230
The Carr surgery.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.965
I know it was you.

17:48.099 --> 17:50.100
Why? Because there's no chance
you would ever make a mistake?

17:50.235 --> 17:53.203
No, because there is no chance that
you are a better doctor than I am.

17:53.238 --> 17:56.405
Oh, for God's sake. Shut up, both of you.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.407
Everett, you're supposed to be on the ward.

18:00.745 --> 18:03.312
Have I missed the twins?

18:03.313 --> 18:04.947
Just.

18:04.948 --> 18:06.383
They asked after you.

18:08.586 --> 18:09.719
Thack! Thack!

18:09.720 --> 18:11.788
Quick, quick, fetch a gurney.

18:11.789 --> 18:13.222
No.

18:13.223 --> 18:14.223
You have been in pain for weeks.

18:14.224 --> 18:15.557
You need to be examined.

18:15.558 --> 18:18.293
You mean opened up? Like hell.

18:18.395 --> 18:20.862
All right, well, maybe
there's another alternative.

18:59.367 --> 19:01.468
Have a look, doctors.

19:05.607 --> 19:07.441
My Lord.

19:07.543 --> 19:11.979
You do realize the patient is
conscious, don't you, Bertie?

19:11.980 --> 19:15.415
I was marveling at the technology.

19:16.952 --> 19:19.153
Zinberg taught you to tell the truth.

19:19.154 --> 19:21.588
I taught you to lie.

19:21.622 --> 19:24.991
Seems like neither of
us did a very good job.

19:24.993 --> 19:27.461
It is a marvelous invention.

19:27.462 --> 19:28.995
And what does it tell you?

19:29.030 --> 19:31.531
That a section of your bowel is ischemic.

19:31.532 --> 19:33.533
Agreed.

19:34.702 --> 19:37.337
I suppose we can guess what's caused it.

19:37.372 --> 19:39.073
Well, we don't need to get into that.

19:39.074 --> 19:41.107
No, that's all right.

19:41.142 --> 19:43.710
A man ingests cocaine for long enough,

19:43.845 --> 19:47.212
then his intestinal blood
vessels don't stand a chance.

19:48.682 --> 19:51.049
You'll need a resection.

19:51.051 --> 19:54.453
Is the entire intestine necrotic?

19:56.056 --> 19:59.158
Well, we can only guess
from what little we can see,

19:59.193 --> 20:01.560
but I'll schedule surgery
as soon as possible.

20:01.561 --> 20:04.763
No, I want to find an alternative.

20:04.764 --> 20:07.166
What do you mean?

20:07.167 --> 20:09.535
I don't want to rush into it.

20:10.704 --> 20:14.040
There are other things I want to try.

20:14.041 --> 20:15.508
Medications.

20:15.509 --> 20:17.742
You collapsed on the street.

20:17.743 --> 20:20.278
Your bowel looks like the badlands.

20:20.279 --> 20:21.746
What more evidence do you need?

20:21.747 --> 20:23.648
No medication is gonna repair that.

20:23.682 --> 20:27.719
Yet it is not for any of you to decide.

20:27.887 --> 20:32.056
Ladies, I am kindly asking you
to please stay out of my way.

20:32.058 --> 20:34.659
I will go wherever I please.

20:34.760 --> 20:38.763
These nurses are saying I
am barred from the building.

20:40.099 --> 20:44.202
You need to make an
appointment like everyone else.

20:44.203 --> 20:46.938
I am not everyone else.

20:49.042 --> 20:52.276
Thank you, nurses. Everything is fine.

20:53.712 --> 20:55.912
Please close the door.

21:02.154 --> 21:04.121
How's your whore?

21:04.122 --> 21:05.622
Is she well?

21:05.623 --> 21:07.425
Junia is very well.

21:07.426 --> 21:09.460
Thank you.

21:09.461 --> 21:11.328
And how's your new apartment?

21:11.329 --> 21:13.597
Tiny and awful, I trust?

21:13.598 --> 21:15.899
Actually, that's why I'm here.

21:15.967 --> 21:20.404
I want you to buy me a
big, nice one with a view

21:20.405 --> 21:23.474
like yours for me and the children.

21:23.475 --> 21:26.176
Preferably on the Upper East Side.

21:26.244 --> 21:29.913
In a dream, that might
be something I would do.

21:29.914 --> 21:32.282
By law, I owe you nothing.

21:45.162 --> 21:47.129
What is that?

21:47.198 --> 21:50.966
Apparently, it's the actual amount of steel

21:50.968 --> 21:52.469
that was delivered to the new Knick

21:52.470 --> 21:55.070
on March 4, 1901.

21:55.139 --> 21:57.707
I'm assuming that
somewhere in this building

21:57.841 --> 22:01.076
there's a document claiming that
the delivery was much greater,

22:01.212 --> 22:04.380
as was the amount that you
required the hospital to pay for it.

22:04.482 --> 22:08.618
We'll both just suppose we
know where the extra money went.

22:08.619 --> 22:10.653
Where did you get that?

22:10.654 --> 22:12.754
You keep excellent records, Herman.

22:12.855 --> 22:15.323
And you were very smart to
keep them out of the hospital

22:15.325 --> 22:17.358
where people could find them.

22:17.460 --> 22:21.329
Unfortunately, when I went
to the bank the other day

22:21.464 --> 22:25.400
to retrieve jewelry from my
safe-deposit box to sell it,

22:25.401 --> 22:28.337
the banker mistakenly gave me the keys

22:28.338 --> 22:31.440
to the other Barrow box.

22:33.343 --> 22:35.544
Where are they now, the papers?

22:35.545 --> 22:38.347
In a new safe-deposit box.

22:38.348 --> 22:40.348
They're all there...

22:40.349 --> 22:42.016
everything you did

22:42.017 --> 22:44.351
and every penny you stole.

22:46.688 --> 22:49.156
What do you want?

22:49.224 --> 22:52.993
I want to live the life I
was accustomed to living.

22:53.028 --> 22:56.830
I want the children back in their schools.

22:56.831 --> 22:59.933
I want the apartment I mentioned.

22:59.934 --> 23:02.169
I want you to suffer.

23:03.938 --> 23:07.307
And I want you to pay
me until the day you die.

23:08.210 --> 23:10.043
How much?

23:10.045 --> 23:13.880
Half paid to me every month.

23:17.118 --> 23:19.919
All right. Half my salary.

23:20.922 --> 23:23.557
And half of everything you steal, skim,

23:23.558 --> 23:26.259
and ferret away.

23:31.199 --> 23:34.434
Over that, you can go fuck yourself.

23:34.569 --> 23:38.038
And I'd advise you to find someone
else that wants to fuck you, too,

23:38.073 --> 23:40.540
because I'm only paying for five years.

23:40.541 --> 23:42.943
After that,

23:42.944 --> 23:45.012
you're on your own.

23:45.080 --> 23:48.114
So start casting about
for men with deep pockets,

23:48.115 --> 23:51.150
poor eyesight, and very little need

23:51.151 --> 23:53.519
for proper sexual gratification.

24:10.470 --> 24:12.371
I've sped up the crews

24:12.439 --> 24:16.242
and I believe we'll
soon be back on schedule.

24:16.243 --> 24:18.477
Are you sure that's wise?

24:18.478 --> 24:20.912
To rush the crews?

24:20.913 --> 24:23.481
Perhaps we should slow them a bit.

24:23.482 --> 24:26.017
I worry about accidents.

24:26.085 --> 24:28.854
As do I, which is why there won't be any.

24:28.855 --> 24:31.256
He won't cooperate.

24:31.257 --> 24:33.625
He's a by-the-book operator.

24:33.626 --> 24:36.394
He's cutting costs.

24:36.495 --> 24:39.664
Wants to bring the project in
under budget from here on out.

24:39.698 --> 24:41.933
- What kind of fruit does that?
- Exactly.

24:41.968 --> 24:45.102
So, we have our normal arrangement?

24:45.203 --> 24:48.806
Look, Herm, I could bust the
guy up, but what's the point?

24:48.807 --> 24:50.174
The building's nearly done.

24:50.175 --> 24:52.109
Let's at least slow it down.

24:52.144 --> 24:54.311
We got to let it get built sometime.

24:54.379 --> 24:56.046
If we didn't, they
wouldn't build the next one

24:56.047 --> 24:57.448
and we couldn't skim off that.

24:57.482 --> 25:01.051
There is no next one. This is it for me.

25:01.052 --> 25:03.287
I have expenses, Jimmy.

25:03.354 --> 25:05.422
You might pull a few more
bucks out of the building,

25:05.490 --> 25:08.024
but short of finding a
way to turn back the clock

25:08.026 --> 25:09.993
and start the whole project over again,

25:09.995 --> 25:11.996
I'd say find another scheme.

25:11.997 --> 25:13.797
I am not giving up.

25:13.832 --> 25:16.167
There are a lot more ways to game this

25:16.168 --> 25:18.302
and I will find them.

25:18.303 --> 25:19.969
I wish you luck, Herm.

25:20.004 --> 25:22.505
And when you do, don't forget our cut.

25:22.506 --> 25:24.173
Yeah.

25:28.679 --> 25:30.579
Do you have a moment?

25:30.580 --> 25:32.715
It's rather urgent.

25:32.716 --> 25:34.650
What is it?

25:34.651 --> 25:36.853
It's the new man.

25:36.854 --> 25:39.388
The architect, Mr. Warren.

25:39.523 --> 25:42.591
From what I can tell, he's
whipping us into shape nicely.

25:42.592 --> 25:46.094
Yes. Very efficient.

25:46.095 --> 25:48.631
But I fear there may be some pitfalls

25:48.665 --> 25:50.999
involved in all of that whipping.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.168
Such as?

25:53.203 --> 25:56.104
Such as the cheapening of quality, for one.

25:56.105 --> 25:59.207
He's using fewer joists, thinner materials.

25:59.242 --> 26:02.678
I'm more than happy to
have less of everything.

26:02.679 --> 26:04.947
Everything,

26:04.948 --> 26:06.748
including costs.

26:06.782 --> 26:10.519
Yes, but with the demands he is placing

26:10.553 --> 26:13.855
on these crews, the speed he wants,

26:13.857 --> 26:16.991
the dangers are immense.

26:18.427 --> 26:20.862
With all that we have
poured into that place,

26:20.930 --> 26:24.232
to have it destroyed by
some terrible calamity...

26:26.201 --> 26:29.603
Warren and his firm
have an excellent record.

26:29.604 --> 26:31.572
The Astors' hotel was a triumph.

26:31.639 --> 26:35.042
I appreciate your caution,
but we're backing him.

26:37.880 --> 26:39.813
Of course.

26:39.814 --> 26:41.883
I'm sure you're right.

26:41.884 --> 26:43.817
Oh, Mrs. Showalter.

26:43.818 --> 26:45.652
Lovely to see you.

26:45.653 --> 26:47.587
And you, Mr. Barrow.

26:54.228 --> 26:56.562
So?

27:00.601 --> 27:03.736
I've tried 100 different ways
to find the holes in this.

27:03.771 --> 27:06.206
I didn't want to believe it either.

27:10.010 --> 27:12.544
It's not in Dad's nature.

27:13.680 --> 27:15.547
I know.

27:17.651 --> 27:19.786
But when I stop looking at him

27:19.787 --> 27:21.821
as just his son...

27:23.957 --> 27:26.592
there is a desperation to him now.

27:28.762 --> 27:30.730
But actual murder?

27:34.100 --> 27:36.068
So what do we do?

27:37.037 --> 27:40.106
I mean, go to the police?

27:44.377 --> 27:46.511
Well, we can't just have
them come to the door

27:46.513 --> 27:49.048
and march him out into some jail.

27:49.049 --> 27:52.117
We need to confront him first.

27:52.152 --> 27:55.320
Allow him to get his affairs in order.

27:55.322 --> 27:57.456
Turn himself in with dignity.

28:00.026 --> 28:03.028
And we need to have him look us in the eye

28:03.029 --> 28:04.630
and admit what he's done.

28:06.699 --> 28:09.100
I suppose it would make it feel

28:09.135 --> 28:11.370
like less of a betrayal that way.

28:14.540 --> 28:18.310
He asked me to meet him at
the construction site at 8:00.

28:19.745 --> 28:21.146
Do you think you can be there, too,

28:21.147 --> 28:23.548
so we can confront him together?

28:23.549 --> 28:25.350
Of course.

28:25.518 --> 28:28.854
What I found in my
investigation of Dr. Gallinger...

28:28.855 --> 28:30.688
By investigation,

28:30.690 --> 28:32.757
you mean breaking into my office

28:32.758 --> 28:34.558
and stealing patient records.

28:34.560 --> 28:36.727
So what you found in your thievery.

28:36.729 --> 28:41.132
What I found is that Dr. Gallinger

28:41.200 --> 28:43.835
has performed dozens of
unauthorized vasectomies

28:43.836 --> 28:45.837
on children,

28:45.938 --> 28:48.372
children who had no say in
their permanent alteration

28:48.407 --> 28:51.075
and all in service of
some harebrained theory

28:51.110 --> 28:53.644
that has no proven
basis in medical science.

28:55.514 --> 28:58.282
Dr. Gallinger, your defense.

28:58.283 --> 29:01.251
I plead guilty, Dr. Phelps.

29:02.421 --> 29:04.688
Guilty to believing what I believe

29:04.689 --> 29:07.291
in doing what I have done.

29:07.359 --> 29:10.028
So you did alter these boys?

29:10.029 --> 29:11.695
Of course.

29:11.696 --> 29:13.597
And I stand by it.

29:15.067 --> 29:17.735
Cripples, imbeciles,

29:17.736 --> 29:20.237
criminals, defectives...

29:20.238 --> 29:23.140
I spare the world from their line

29:23.141 --> 29:25.575
in order to benefit the greater good.

29:28.146 --> 29:32.182
What gives a man the right to play God?

29:33.752 --> 29:35.352
Deciding who is hereditarily fit

29:35.386 --> 29:37.487
and who unworthy to bear children?

29:37.556 --> 29:41.825
What Dr. Gallinger did
was an act of egotism,

29:41.826 --> 29:45.595
of cruelty, and of malpractice.

29:45.630 --> 29:47.965
As his superior at the Knickerbocker,

29:47.966 --> 29:50.032
it is my recommendation that this board

29:50.134 --> 29:53.770
considers a full revocation
of Dr. Gallinger's credentials.

29:53.771 --> 29:55.472
What Edwards has left out

29:55.473 --> 29:57.574
of his mongrelization-loving diatribe

29:57.575 --> 30:00.444
is that full permission was granted

30:00.445 --> 30:02.512
on every single procedure

30:02.513 --> 30:05.448
on every single one of those boys.

30:05.450 --> 30:07.917
Let me introduce Dr. Samuel Reid.

30:09.187 --> 30:10.787
Good afternoon, doctors.

30:10.921 --> 30:13.923
Dr. Reid is the director of the
Idiot House on Randall's Island.

30:13.924 --> 30:15.591
I am indeed.

30:15.658 --> 30:19.361
I have state guardianship
of all the boys in my home

30:19.463 --> 30:22.998
and I did, in fact, grant
Dr. Gallinger full permission

30:22.999 --> 30:24.800
to perform these procedures.

30:24.867 --> 30:26.702
You have papers to
substantiate all of this?

30:26.703 --> 30:28.336
Of course.

30:28.371 --> 30:31.373
Dr. Gallinger and I
have a similar philosophy

30:31.374 --> 30:33.509
when it comes to these matters.

30:33.610 --> 30:36.778
Oh, so this quackery is
now sanctioned by the state.

30:36.779 --> 30:38.414
Wonderful.

30:38.515 --> 30:42.650
What Edwards and other people
of his kind cannot accept

30:42.718 --> 30:46.954
is there is great validity
in the eugenics movement.

30:46.989 --> 30:49.123
States such as California and Indiana

30:49.191 --> 30:52.326
are already seeing the
benefits of a purified society

30:52.394 --> 30:55.830
and are considering writing
it into their legislation.

30:55.964 --> 31:00.201
This movement is growing faster
than any other in modern medicine.

31:00.202 --> 31:03.337
But men like Edwards

31:03.339 --> 31:05.105
likely also buried their heads

31:05.174 --> 31:07.708
when other revolutions
arose like germ theory,

31:07.743 --> 31:11.679
vaccinations, things that proved over time

31:11.680 --> 31:13.780
to be miracles.

31:15.651 --> 31:18.485
Now, if the board sees fit to prevent
me from practicing in New York,

31:18.520 --> 31:22.823
there are hundreds of other institutions

31:22.891 --> 31:26.660
and doctors whom I'm sure would welcome me.

31:28.530 --> 31:30.564
Thank you, Dr. Gallinger.

31:32.668 --> 31:34.634
Dr. Edwards,

31:34.703 --> 31:37.537
how much have you studied
the eugenics movement?

31:39.607 --> 31:41.541
I've read several articles in "Lancet"

31:41.543 --> 31:43.510
and in other medical journals.

31:43.678 --> 31:46.946
And you believe that's enough to
discredit an entire field of study?

31:46.947 --> 31:49.082
A field which is now being taught

31:49.116 --> 31:52.619
in hundreds of medical
schools and universities?

31:52.620 --> 31:55.822
This isn't about a field of study.

31:57.192 --> 31:59.058
It is about intention.

31:59.126 --> 32:02.028
But Dr. Gallinger's
intentions were, in his words,

32:02.029 --> 32:03.497
for the greater good.

32:03.531 --> 32:06.300
Yes, but for the greater good of whom?

32:06.301 --> 32:08.602
Himself?

32:08.603 --> 32:10.470
You, Dr. Phelps?

32:10.471 --> 32:12.372
Mankind.

32:12.440 --> 32:15.575
Eugenics is, in my
opinion, a very legitimate

32:15.576 --> 32:18.011
and necessary study.

32:18.212 --> 32:21.814
So much so I've added it to the curriculum
at my own Columbia Medical College.

32:21.949 --> 32:25.018
You broke into his office and
you accused him of doing something

32:25.052 --> 32:28.087
to which he apparently had every right.

32:28.155 --> 32:31.624
Unless my colleagues differ
from me in their opinions,

32:31.658 --> 32:34.593
I see no reason to grant your request.

32:36.831 --> 32:38.764
I see.

32:41.135 --> 32:43.069
Thank you, Doctor.

32:46.240 --> 32:48.608
Thank you.

32:48.609 --> 32:50.242
Thank you.

33:05.292 --> 33:07.760
You really intend on doing this?

33:11.831 --> 33:14.766
You realize you're just
proving my entire thesis?

33:21.741 --> 33:24.910
I just made a logical

33:24.911 --> 33:27.645
and scientific argument...

33:28.915 --> 33:32.050
and respected, learned men agreed with me

33:32.051 --> 33:34.486
because whether you like it or not,

33:34.487 --> 33:37.388
this field of study is legitimate

33:37.389 --> 33:39.757
and it's not going away.

33:39.758 --> 33:41.892
It is fact.

33:43.695 --> 33:46.597
Of course, instead of
being a man of science,

33:46.598 --> 33:50.000
you raise your fists like an animal,

33:50.068 --> 33:53.137
the animal we are
proving your people to be.

33:55.107 --> 33:57.441
In the face of intellectual reason,

33:57.442 --> 34:00.811
you can't help but resort to violence.

34:03.848 --> 34:05.815
Well, I won't.

34:08.351 --> 34:10.187
'Cause the fight is already...

34:15.860 --> 34:18.061
Now you just proved it again,

34:18.062 --> 34:19.963
stupid nigger.

34:27.804 --> 34:30.071
Dorothy!

34:31.407 --> 34:33.775
- Dorothy!
- Everett?

34:33.775 --> 34:36.678
- What is it?
- I won.

34:37.580 --> 34:40.482
I beat that dusky bastard every which way.

34:40.483 --> 34:42.985
I tamed the goddamn beast.

34:42.985 --> 34:44.553
Did you go for his eye?

34:44.554 --> 34:46.755
Like a hammer to a nail.

34:46.755 --> 34:48.790
He had no idea I knew.

34:51.293 --> 34:53.460
Let's go upstairs.

34:55.831 --> 34:57.898
Take me right here.

35:04.740 --> 35:06.674
It don't matter if she's a cocktrough whore

35:06.675 --> 35:08.176
or dressed up like a dog's dinner.

35:08.244 --> 35:10.411
You can't tell a thing
by looking at 'em, fellas.

35:10.445 --> 35:12.647
They maybe got it, and maybe they don't.

35:12.781 --> 35:15.649
But these will keep you from
getting the bug no matter what.

35:15.650 --> 35:17.252
You want to lose your nose, hmm?

35:17.253 --> 35:18.586
Your ears? Your toes?

35:18.620 --> 35:20.087
'Cause you didn't cover up your bell-end?

35:20.155 --> 35:22.255
You want to be answering
to the name of Daddy?

35:22.423 --> 35:26.092
Coupled off to some mistake with a
face like a bulldog chewing a wasp?

35:26.094 --> 35:27.494
Now I know what you're thinking.

35:27.595 --> 35:29.462
But pulling out of her
cave at the last second

35:29.497 --> 35:30.830
and painting her belly won't save you.

35:30.831 --> 35:32.265
All the docs say so.

35:32.300 --> 35:33.700
There's only one way to go here, fellas,

35:33.701 --> 35:34.801
and it's right here in my hand.

35:34.835 --> 35:36.736
Don't slip it in till you slip it on.

35:36.771 --> 35:38.905
It's a dime a fuck. 10 in a pack.

35:38.973 --> 35:41.341
Only cost you a buck
for 10 rolls in the sack.

35:41.342 --> 35:43.643
Get your money. What are you doing?

35:43.644 --> 35:45.445
I'm out.

35:45.446 --> 35:46.379
I barely finished my tout.

35:46.381 --> 35:48.480
I didn't have to say a word.

36:08.668 --> 36:10.669
Look what I have.

36:10.670 --> 36:13.371
Only charge you 15 cents for it.

36:13.372 --> 36:16.274
The rest costs extra.

37:09.394 --> 37:11.695
Do you remember Moon Flower?

37:13.465 --> 37:15.932
That old plow mule we had?

37:17.735 --> 37:21.070
I remember how stubborn she was.

37:22.373 --> 37:24.540
We would beat on her and beat on her.

37:24.542 --> 37:27.076
And there came a day finally

37:27.077 --> 37:29.578
when she stopped being stubborn.

37:31.616 --> 37:34.083
She was so old at that point.

37:35.987 --> 37:38.688
Had that lame hind limb.

37:40.224 --> 37:42.892
Eyes always dripping from fly bites.

37:45.095 --> 37:47.797
Levi used to do the
funniest imitation of her.

37:51.903 --> 37:55.238
But she obeyed

37:55.272 --> 37:58.274
and worked all day with no hesitation

37:58.308 --> 38:01.744
and then limped back to the barn at night,

38:01.745 --> 38:03.579
waiting in the dark not moving

38:03.680 --> 38:06.982
until the beating and the work
started again the next morning.

38:10.287 --> 38:12.421
Did that until she was all used up

38:12.489 --> 38:15.224
and there was nothing
left to do but shoot her.

38:26.537 --> 38:29.739
This world offers too much.

38:32.109 --> 38:35.845
And contrary to what you think,

38:35.879 --> 38:39.348
I'm too smart to let
myself turn out that way.

38:41.885 --> 38:44.954
And if that means sinning

38:44.955 --> 38:47.855
to get what I want,

38:47.856 --> 38:51.025
well, then, so be it.

38:53.128 --> 38:55.463
I won't be shamed by the likes of you

38:55.464 --> 38:58.099
or anyone else anymore.

39:00.669 --> 39:03.671
What I've done,

39:03.672 --> 39:06.340
what I will do...

39:07.676 --> 39:09.978
is nowhere near the deceitful life

39:09.979 --> 39:11.979
you've obviously led.

39:16.051 --> 39:19.120
God has turned a deaf
ear to you, I'm afraid.

39:26.061 --> 39:30.898
Eternal damnation is the
fate of Pastor Elkins.

39:35.037 --> 39:38.406
But before you go to the flames,

39:38.540 --> 39:42.342
I think it's only fair to confess
the rest of my sins to you.

39:44.546 --> 39:47.815
See, what I confessed in church that night,

39:47.849 --> 39:51.285
that night you beat me like that mule,

39:51.286 --> 39:54.888
isn't the whole story.

39:54.956 --> 39:59.192
The man I mentioned I
had a relationship with,

39:59.194 --> 40:02.362
he's the chief of surgery here.

40:02.364 --> 40:04.998
Dr. Thackery. You met him.

40:06.268 --> 40:08.134
You shook the very fingers

40:08.203 --> 40:11.605
I begged him to slip
inside me so many times.

40:13.475 --> 40:15.275
He's older than you.

40:17.445 --> 40:20.080
And he was a terrible cocaine user.

40:21.616 --> 40:23.884
I used to get him his drugs,

40:23.985 --> 40:28.220
and in return he would dip
his erect penis in those drugs

40:28.255 --> 40:31.457
and let me feel just how good it was.

40:36.096 --> 40:39.398
After that, I would do anything for him

40:39.400 --> 40:41.100
as long as he would fuck me.

40:45.606 --> 40:50.276
But that, dear Father,

40:50.277 --> 40:52.745
is not the end of my story.

40:54.348 --> 40:56.148
I sunk lower.

40:57.984 --> 41:00.820
Maybe in all your
experience with the brothels

41:00.854 --> 41:03.823
you've heard of something
called the Golden Lotus.

41:06.260 --> 41:08.693
While he was having sex,

41:08.761 --> 41:11.763
I stuck my foot in the mouth of an Oriental

41:11.797 --> 41:14.799
and let him suck on it as he ejaculated.

41:16.769 --> 41:20.171
And he paid me $100 for the pleasure.

41:22.174 --> 41:23.909
More than once.

41:27.780 --> 41:31.115
I just wanted you to know
everything before you went.

41:35.288 --> 41:37.121
Bye, Daddy.

41:38.524 --> 41:40.759
Enjoy your trip.

42:36.447 --> 42:38.415
Dad?

42:45.456 --> 42:47.557
Dad?

42:47.558 --> 42:49.592
Are you here?

42:53.898 --> 42:55.697
Hey there.

42:55.699 --> 42:58.167
I didn't expect to see you here.

42:58.202 --> 43:00.936
Come on up. The view is wonderful.

43:12.482 --> 43:15.083
That's a long walk.

43:15.085 --> 43:17.586
There'll be an elevator soon.

43:17.587 --> 43:18.888
Where's Henry?

43:18.889 --> 43:20.422
He'll be here any moment.

43:20.423 --> 43:22.058
Good.

43:22.059 --> 43:23.925
What do you think?

43:25.595 --> 43:27.596
Hmm?

43:27.597 --> 43:29.564
Cold rooms.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.568
Light therapy patio up on the roof.

43:35.271 --> 43:37.104
Gonna be a marvel.

43:40.676 --> 43:42.610
This is it.

43:44.580 --> 43:46.747
This is my legacy.

43:49.585 --> 43:51.286
Long after I'm gone,

43:51.320 --> 43:53.788
this is what people will remember me for.

43:56.192 --> 43:59.494
I'm not certain it's all
you'll be remembered for.

44:00.930 --> 44:03.630
Well, there'll be the
shipping and other endeavors,

44:03.631 --> 44:05.765
but this,

44:05.800 --> 44:11.137
oh, this is going to save lives every day.

44:11.172 --> 44:14.874
Then why would you be so greedy and foolish

44:14.876 --> 44:17.511
as to risk and hurt so many people?

44:18.679 --> 44:21.048
What do you mean?

44:21.049 --> 44:23.717
I know about it, Dad.

44:23.718 --> 44:26.387
I know about the inspectors

44:26.388 --> 44:28.789
and the bribes and the ports.

44:28.790 --> 44:30.524
I know about it all.

44:30.625 --> 44:32.693
Cornelia, you're jabbering.
What are you talking...

44:32.827 --> 44:35.529
Inspector Bradley and the
Immigration Office at the docks.

44:35.630 --> 44:38.264
You've been bribing him and his men.

44:39.733 --> 44:42.335
Inspector Brad...

44:42.369 --> 44:45.538
Oh, Neely, there isn't a shipping man

44:45.639 --> 44:48.274
in New York who doesn't go
out and slip those fellas

44:48.375 --> 44:52.445
a 20 every now and again to
get a little happy in a pub.

44:53.713 --> 44:55.581
But that is hardly a crime.

44:55.649 --> 44:58.384
If only that was your crime, but it's not.

44:58.385 --> 45:01.787
I know it and Henry knows it.

45:01.888 --> 45:04.923
You move up the sick and
the poor to second-class

45:04.992 --> 45:07.560
and the inspectors let
them into the country

45:07.661 --> 45:10.596
where they infest the
tenements and the neighborhoods.

45:10.597 --> 45:13.866
People died, Dad. Lots of them.

45:13.867 --> 45:16.234
In San Francisco and Hawaii.

45:16.235 --> 45:18.170
Here in New York.

45:18.204 --> 45:20.606
Speight found out and you killed him, too.

45:20.607 --> 45:22.174
What?

45:24.177 --> 45:28.580
What in the hell are you accusing me of?

45:28.582 --> 45:30.515
Don't make it worse by denying it.

45:30.517 --> 45:31.684
Neely, this is ridiculous.

45:31.685 --> 45:34.186
Don't touch me.

45:39.359 --> 45:43.262
I assure you

45:43.296 --> 45:47.398
I did none of the things that you say.

45:48.300 --> 45:50.201
Look around you.

45:50.202 --> 45:52.536
Take a good look around!

45:54.940 --> 45:58.743
If I was so concerned about money...

46:00.746 --> 46:03.214
...would I be working so hard
to give it away to the Knick?

46:03.281 --> 46:06.050
- I know your business is in trouble.
- What?

46:06.118 --> 46:09.053
- You owe Hobart an enormous amount.
- Neely.

46:11.724 --> 46:14.258
In a way.

46:14.259 --> 46:16.660
But that is just an investment

46:16.661 --> 46:18.996
that he made in me.

46:18.997 --> 46:20.631
I am on the rebound.

46:20.765 --> 46:23.600
Yet you still can't cover
your commitments to the Knick.

46:25.137 --> 46:30.007
I did not do what you think.

46:30.008 --> 46:32.510
We're going to the police,

46:32.511 --> 46:34.512
Henry and I.

46:34.513 --> 46:36.313
It's already decided.

46:36.314 --> 46:39.717
Neely, this is preposterous.

46:44.156 --> 46:45.822
Do you smell that?

46:45.823 --> 46:47.823
What?

46:49.626 --> 46:51.427
Oh, my God.

46:51.429 --> 46:53.429
We've got to get out of here.

46:58.936 --> 47:01.070
Oh, God.

47:04.975 --> 47:06.776
Look, over there.

47:12.950 --> 47:14.649
It's a 20-foot drop.

47:17.554 --> 47:19.488
Help me with this.

47:26.529 --> 47:29.664
I'm gonna lower this
ladder down in the hole.

47:30.667 --> 47:33.135
Wait. You've got to go sideways.

47:33.136 --> 47:35.137
Here, go up. Go up.

47:36.640 --> 47:38.440
I got it.

47:39.509 --> 47:42.611
- All right, here.
- It's not long enough.

47:42.679 --> 47:44.713
It'll carry you most
of the way, maybe more.

47:44.715 --> 47:46.515
You can climb down, hang, and drop.

47:46.549 --> 47:48.550
- I'll hold it from up here.
- No.

47:48.585 --> 47:50.752
You have to, Neely. There's no other way.

47:50.753 --> 47:52.487
- And what about you?
- Go find help.

47:52.522 --> 47:54.222
There's a fire brigade two blocks down.

47:54.257 --> 47:55.857
They've probably already seen the smoke.

47:55.858 --> 47:57.759
I'll go up the stairs
and wait it out up there.

47:57.760 --> 47:59.193
- Now, go. You've got to go.
- I won't.

47:59.195 --> 48:00.729
Neely, you're running out of time!

48:00.730 --> 48:03.799
Go! Get on this ladder and go now.

48:05.768 --> 48:09.204
That's it. Climb down as far as you can.

48:09.205 --> 48:12.374
Oh, God.

48:12.375 --> 48:14.743
That's it, Neely. Go.

48:14.744 --> 48:16.812
As far as you can go.

48:19.048 --> 48:20.749
That's it.

48:22.752 --> 48:24.453
Good, now let go.

48:24.454 --> 48:26.755
Now, Neely. Now!

48:32.927 --> 48:35.729
Neely? Neely?

48:35.730 --> 48:37.998
Neely, are you all right?

48:39.034 --> 48:40.901
Go get help.

48:40.902 --> 48:43.471
Go.

48:43.472 --> 48:45.339
Now.

49:15.468 --> 49:17.703
Where?

49:20.808 --> 49:22.608
Dad!

49:30.450 --> 49:32.484
No! No!

49:41.527 --> 49:43.794
Shh, shh.

50:11.056 --> 50:13.357
Oh, God.

50:22.099 --> 50:24.701
Oh, God.

50:30.241 --> 50:31.875
We're almost there.

50:31.909 --> 50:34.678
We should talk about compensation.

50:34.712 --> 50:38.047
No, I'm not much interested in money.

50:40.518 --> 50:44.687
You know, I fund a hospital in New York.

50:44.688 --> 50:46.889
The Knickerbocker.

50:46.923 --> 50:50.425
Isn't that where J.M. Christiansen is?

50:50.460 --> 50:53.361
I hear he's doing some astonishing work.

50:55.565 --> 50:57.566
You two should meet.

50:57.567 --> 50:58.934
I'll introduce you.
