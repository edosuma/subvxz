01:16.880 --> 01:18.166
Dottie!

01:20.520 --> 01:23.000
Dottie, God damn it, wake up!

01:26.760 --> 01:27.966
Shut up, T-Bone!

01:30.160 --> 01:33.369
God damn it, Dottie, let me in!
T-Bone, shut up!

01:37.000 --> 01:38.809
Dottie!

01:38.880 --> 01:40.644
Wake Up!

01:40.720 --> 01:42.006
Dottie!

01:45.200 --> 01:48.966
Open the goddamn door!
Dottie!

01:52.800 --> 01:55.883
Get out of that fucking bed
right fucking now!

01:59.360 --> 02:01.647
Dottie, open this door!

02:01.720 --> 02:03.484
Dottie!

02:03.600 --> 02:07.127
Dottie, please open the door!
...Dottie!

02:12.560 --> 02:14.722
Dottie, I gotta take a piss!

02:16.480 --> 02:18.084
Wake up, it's me!

02:21.560 --> 02:22.800
Shit!

02:22.880 --> 02:23.961
Hold on!

02:25.080 --> 02:28.004
- Open the goddamn door!
- I'm coming, just a second.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.206
Shut up!

02:33.920 --> 02:37.641
Oh, God, put some clothes on,
for Christ's sake!

02:38.840 --> 02:40.251
Well, hell,
I didn't know who you were.

02:40.560 --> 02:41.891
Shit.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.329
Close the goddamn door!

02:45.400 --> 02:47.846
You answer the door like that,
if you don't know who the hell it is?

02:47.920 --> 02:49.331
Nothing you never seen before.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.880
Nothing half of Dallas County
hasn't seen before.

02:51.960 --> 02:52.961
Shut up.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.804
Dad here?

02:55.880 --> 02:57.530
He's asleep.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.364
Dottie's here, ain't she?

02:59.440 --> 03:04.002
- Did Adele throw you out?
- No, I need to talk to Dad.

03:04.120 --> 03:05.884
Why'd she throw you out?
Did you hit her again?

03:05.960 --> 03:07.564
No, I didn't hit her.

03:07.640 --> 03:09.051
Hey' look,

03:09.120 --> 03:11.202
would you please put some clothes on?

03:11.280 --> 03:14.011
- My God, I never heard so much...
- It's a bit distracting.

03:14.080 --> 03:16.003
Your bush staring me in the face.

03:16.080 --> 03:17.445
All right! Jesus.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.045
God damn it!

03:22.440 --> 03:24.044
Help yourself.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.248
What'd you do?
Chop up some clover?

03:26.320 --> 03:27.651
Where'd you get this shit?

03:27.720 --> 03:29.563
I bought it from you.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.930
This is that?

03:33.920 --> 03:34.921
What are you doing here?

03:35.000 --> 03:36.525
Adele threw him out.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.887
So what? The boy can talk.

03:38.960 --> 03:40.485
I need a place to stay' all right?

03:40.720 --> 03:42.927
Why'd she throw you out?

03:43.800 --> 03:45.211
It's a long story.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.323
Sharla, get me a beer.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.368
What'd you do? Hit her again?

03:49.480 --> 03:51.721
No, God damn it! I didn't hit her.

03:51.800 --> 03:54.201
It's not like
you never hit her before.

03:54.280 --> 03:56.203
This ain't none
of your goddamn business, Sharla.

03:56.280 --> 03:58.408
- Hey, I live here.
- Calm down.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.562
Listen, Dad,
I gotta listen to your naked wife

04:00.640 --> 04:02.483
- giving me the third degree?
- I'm not naked.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.768
Why do you let her walk around here
like that'?

04:04.840 --> 04:06.001
- Like what?
- It's the middle Of the night.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.048
She answered the door
with her beaver puckered out

04:08.120 --> 04:10.122
- like it was trying to shake my hand.
- You hush your mouth'

04:10.200 --> 04:13.124
- She didn't know who you were.
- That ain't the point, God damn it.

04:13.200 --> 04:16.249
I don't want Dottie looking
at her own stepmother's pussy.

04:16.360 --> 04:17.850
That's it. I'm going to bed.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.410
I've heard all the shit
I can take in one night.

04:19.480 --> 04:21.209
Good night.

04:21.320 --> 04:23.209
You little shit,
I'm going to fucking kill you!

04:26.680 --> 04:28.091
- Cut it out!
- Sweet dreams!

04:28.160 --> 04:29.127
- ...kill you!
- Damn it.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.929
Enough on the weed!

04:31.040 --> 04:32.166
He can stay here tonight!

04:32.240 --> 04:33.969
Hey, I'll stay as long
as I goddamn feel like it!

04:34.040 --> 04:37.283
If he stays here any longer, I'm
liable to hurt the little bastard!

04:37.360 --> 04:39.522
- Don't go to bed mad.
- Good night! Fucker!

04:40.000 --> 04:42.082
- Don't die in your sleep!
- Goddamn hick!

04:43.840 --> 04:45.285
What the fuck?

04:45.360 --> 04:48.011
- Now I'm in the fucking doghouse.
- Hey, put some pamts on

04:48.080 --> 04:49.684
I need to talk to you
about something.

04:49.760 --> 04:52.127
- I need pants for that?
- So we can get out of here.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.521
- I'm not going out.
- Come on, this is private stuff.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.443
Then fucking whisper!

04:56.520 --> 04:58.841
I need you to put some pants on.

04:58.920 --> 04:59.967
- No.
- Come on.

05:11.400 --> 05:14.051
I need $6,000
or some guys are gonna kill me.

05:14.120 --> 05:15.849
You'd better get out of town, quick.

05:15.960 --> 05:18.645
- If you could just give me $1,000?
- I don't have it.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.609
Hey, I could hold them off
with $1,000.

05:20.680 --> 05:22.330
Chris, I do not have it.

06:03.480 --> 06:06.211
I wouldn't be in this mess
if it weren't for Mom.

06:06.280 --> 06:08.601
Then she goes and kicks me out.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.329
You hit her, didn't you?

06:11.400 --> 06:12.686
God damn it, no!

06:12.760 --> 06:14.762
I didn't hit her, I told you.

06:14.840 --> 06:16.763
Why'd she kick you out?

06:18.160 --> 06:20.527
I threw her up against the fridge.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.523
She stole two ounces of coke from me.

06:22.600 --> 06:25.126
That's bullshit.
Adele doesn't snort cocaine.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.164
She sold it.

06:27.280 --> 06:30.250
Gave it away to that goddamn Rex,
'cause the shit's gone.

06:30.320 --> 06:32.721
She was the only other one
knew where it was. Then tonight,

06:32.800 --> 06:36.646
she comes up to the house
with her car running like a watch.

06:36.720 --> 06:40.645
Which? The gold Cadillac?
You're shitting me.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.485
- Piece of shit hadn't run in years
- What'd I tell you?

06:44.560 --> 06:47.643
So my blow is gone
and now these guys are gonna kill me.

06:47.760 --> 06:50.161
And my own mother for Christ's sake.

06:55.480 --> 06:56.811
so...?

06:57.600 --> 07:00.444
- Huh? What?
- You gonna loan me the money?

07:00.520 --> 07:02.488
- No.
- Man, I'm fucked.

07:03.440 --> 07:05.841
I hadn't had $1,000 in
my whole life.

07:05.920 --> 07:07.445
How'd you like to?

07:07.520 --> 07:09.841
- How'd you like to have $15,000?
- Jesus.

07:09.920 --> 07:11.490
No, just hear me out.

07:12.360 --> 07:15.603
Every goddamn time,
What about the farm?

07:15.680 --> 07:17.125
Leave the farm out of it.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.043
I'm talking about something
way easier than that.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.406
Ugh!

07:20.720 --> 07:22.290
This ought to be good.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.488
You ever hear of Joe Cooper?

07:25.360 --> 07:27.328
- No.
- He's a cop.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.243
A detective, actually.

07:29.880 --> 07:30.847
Okay.

07:30.920 --> 07:33.764
He's got a little business
on the side

07:33.840 --> 07:34.921
What's he do?

07:35.360 --> 07:38.204
He's a killer. He kills people.

07:40.720 --> 07:41.960
Yeah. so?

07:43.160 --> 07:47.051
Mom's got
a $50,000 life insurance policy.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.240
Don't look at me like that.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.448
Well, who's the...
What do you call it?

07:54.520 --> 07:56.761
Beneficiary.

07:56.840 --> 07:58.444
- Dottie.
- Dottie?

07:59.320 --> 08:02.130
- The whole thing? The whole $50,000?
- Yup.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.685
She didn't
leave nothing to me?

08:03.760 --> 08:07.287
Of course not, you dipshit,
Why would she do that?

08:07.360 --> 08:08.805
I'm her ex-husband.

08:08.880 --> 08:11.326
She hates you, Dad.
You know that.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.647
How much something like that cost?

08:16.720 --> 08:18.688
Well, I hear he charges 20.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.842
Thousand? Jesus.

08:20.920 --> 08:23.730
Listen, this isn't really something
we can cut corners on.

08:23.800 --> 08:26.007
I'd say it's worth it
not to get caught.

08:26.080 --> 08:29.801
I mean, Killer Joe's a professional
He'll do this right.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.724
How do you know?
Who told you about this?

08:36.799 --> 08:38.450
Never mind that.

08:44.720 --> 08:47.087
I want to hire him on spec
Ask him to do it for free

08:47.160 --> 08:49.367
and then give him
a cut of the insurance money.

08:49.440 --> 08:51.966
Well, after we pay this guy

08:52.040 --> 08:55.761
- and we clear $30,000
- 30 thousand.

08:55.840 --> 08:58.241
- We split it four ways
- Three ways.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.800
- How do you figure?
- You, me and Dottie.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.006
What about Sharla?

09:02.640 --> 09:03.687
What about her?

09:03.760 --> 09:04.921
She gets a cut.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.604
The hell she does,
She ain't family.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.728
She's been my wife
longer than Adele was.

09:08.800 --> 09:09.767
It's less money.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.080
It's less money for you.

09:11.480 --> 09:13.244
And it's more money for you.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.651
I'm the father here.

09:15.080 --> 09:17.526
I found her, She's my ex-wife.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.170
Not you, Not Dottie.

09:19.240 --> 09:22.164
Okay, fine.
We'll just split it four ways.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.807
I ain't agreeing
to nothing, okay?

09:29.320 --> 09:31.926
This is murder we're talking about.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.608
I'm not just gonna stand here
nodding my head.

09:35.160 --> 09:39.051
Look at it this way.
Is she doing anybody any good?

09:39.120 --> 09:40.246
What do you mean?

09:40.320 --> 09:43.529
Is anybody gonna care
if Mom's not around any more?

09:43.600 --> 09:45.364
Yeah. Rex.

09:45.480 --> 09:48.245
Son of a bitch screws
anything draws breath.

09:48.320 --> 09:51.449
- That doesn't mean he doesn't care.
- He'd be tickled pink.

09:51.520 --> 09:53.568
You should see the way
she treats that poor bastard.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.010
Probably about the same way
she treated me.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.609
What's better for Dottie?

10:09.680 --> 10:12.365
Having $10,000,
so she can go to that Amazon school

10:12.440 --> 10:16.081
or having a beat-up,
old, ugly, naggy alcoholic mother

10:16.160 --> 10:18.288
for another 20 years or so?

10:20.120 --> 10:22.726
- I see your point.
- Exactly.

10:22.800 --> 10:25.371
So long as Dottie never knows
what we're talking about.

10:25.920 --> 10:28.207
We're really doing her a favour.

10:29.440 --> 10:30.566
Yeah.

10:32.080 --> 10:34.048
What are you doing here?

10:38.440 --> 10:39.885
Got in a fight with Mom.

10:40.600 --> 10:43.171
You build this city all by yourself?

10:44.120 --> 10:45.246
Yeah.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.086
Sure did.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.450
Brick by brick.

10:50.440 --> 10:52.568
I heard that at the wedding.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.928
Scared the shit out of me.

11:01.320 --> 11:03.527
Sleep talking gives me the creeps.

11:03.640 --> 11:05.768
Yeah. Gotten worse.

11:06.240 --> 11:07.969
About every night.

11:10.600 --> 11:11.726
She's not seeing anybody yet?

11:13.440 --> 11:14.885
Don't hold your breath.

11:14.960 --> 11:18.681
Truth be told,
I think she's still a... You know.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.000
What?

11:20.080 --> 11:21.320
A virgin?

11:24.440 --> 11:25.726
Let me just call him.

11:25.800 --> 11:28.041
And at least just set up a meet
and talk to the guy.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.805
We don't got to decide anything
right now.

11:30.880 --> 11:32.962
- ANSEL Okay.
- Okay. good.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.408
I heard y'all talking
about killing Momma.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.048
I think it's a good idea.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.001
Well, there you go.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.926
This is murder we're talking about.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.209
That looks hard.

13:36.280 --> 13:37.486
Who are you?

13:38.360 --> 13:40.442
Joe Cooper. Joe Cooper.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.488
You scared me to death.

13:43.440 --> 13:44.771
Excuse me.

13:47.800 --> 13:49.689
And I apologise.

13:49.760 --> 13:52.286
I knocked on the door,
but you had the TV on too loud

13:52.360 --> 13:55.409
to hear me,
so I decided to let myself in.

13:56.160 --> 13:57.446
It's okay.

13:58.760 --> 14:01.604
That looks hard. From a TV like that.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.490
You should have a teacher.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.610
I'm Joe Cooper.

14:08.840 --> 14:11.366
I'm supposed to meet Chris here
at 10:30.

14:11.440 --> 14:13.249
He's not here.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.526
Well, I'm a little early.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.329
He's usually late.

14:21.440 --> 14:24.171
Could I trouble you
for a cup of coffee?

14:25.200 --> 14:26.326
Sure.

14:27.720 --> 14:29.563
Why don't you sit down
and I'll take your jacket.

14:29.680 --> 14:30.841
Mmm-hmm. Thank you.

14:38.480 --> 14:39.481
Can I ask your name?

14:41.120 --> 14:42.884
I'm Dottie.

14:42.960 --> 14:44.405
Hello, Dottie.

14:44.480 --> 14:45.686
Hi.

14:54.880 --> 14:55.927
What?

14:57.640 --> 14:59.165
What are you?

14:59.840 --> 15:01.490
I mean, what do you do?

15:04.520 --> 15:06.010
I'm a detective.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.885
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

15:08.960 --> 15:10.405
Like Magnum P.I?

15:10.480 --> 15:11.811
No.

15:11.880 --> 15:14.042
He's a private detective.

15:14.520 --> 15:17.091
I'm in the Dallas Police Department.

15:17.160 --> 15:19.288
- He ain't real, either...
- No.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.521
I'm real.

15:23.720 --> 15:26.849
I read it's nothing like them shows
with car chases and all.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.684
A lot of paperwork.

15:29.280 --> 15:31.009
I read some policemen
go their whole lives

15:31.080 --> 15:32.764
without shooting their guns.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.410
Probably true.

15:37.760 --> 15:40.570
- You ever drawn your gun?
- Oh, sure.

15:42.120 --> 15:43.246
You ever shot anybody?

15:43.760 --> 15:45.762
- Yes.
- Who?

15:47.040 --> 15:48.883
Nobody you'd know.

15:48.960 --> 15:50.246
Did they die?

15:51.760 --> 15:53.967
Well, they have. Yes.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.086
Wow.

15:56.680 --> 15:59.445
What's the most exciting thing
that's ever happened?

15:59.560 --> 16:01.210
Hmm.

16:04.120 --> 16:06.202
I went into this house.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.485
I heard an awful screaming
coming from

16:10.680 --> 16:12.409
inside in the back.

16:13.720 --> 16:15.609
And it was pitch dark.

16:17.560 --> 16:21.087
So I followed the sound of the scream
back to a bedroom.

16:21.720 --> 16:23.643
And I didn't know
what the hell to expect.

16:23.720 --> 16:24.846
Yeah.

16:25.240 --> 16:28.926
When I opened the door
suddenly just... Whap!

16:29.440 --> 16:32.762
There's this huge, fat man

16:33.760 --> 16:35.410
was on top of me.

16:35.840 --> 16:39.447
- Screaming and kicking and clawing
- Oh, my God.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.724
And the thing was,

16:42.520 --> 16:44.921
there was nobody else even there.

16:45.240 --> 16:49.529
And he wasn't trying to hurt me,
He wanted me to help him.

16:50.640 --> 16:51.846
Why?

16:52.400 --> 16:56.200
See, he got into a fight
with his girlfriend, right?

16:56.280 --> 16:58.681
She'd been having an affair, so...

16:59.560 --> 17:01.927
In order to teach her a lesson.

17:02.280 --> 17:04.044
That's what he said.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.409
"Teach her a lesson."

17:08.480 --> 17:11.050
He doused his genitals
with lighter ï¬‚uid

17:11.119 --> 17:13.281
and he set them on fire.

17:15.599 --> 17:17.284
You believe that?

17:18.640 --> 17:20.130
It's true.

17:20.920 --> 17:25.686
That poor miserable bastard
set his own genitals on fire

17:25.760 --> 17:28.525
just to teach his girlfriend
a lesson.

17:30.920 --> 17:32.809
I guess he showed her.

17:36.280 --> 17:38.328
I wonder if she ever got over it.

17:39.960 --> 17:42.122
- Was he all right?
- No.

17:43.320 --> 17:45.846
No, he was not all right.

17:45.960 --> 17:48.167
He set his genitals on fire.

17:50.760 --> 17:53.650
I had an aunt
who set herself on fire once.

17:53.760 --> 17:54.761
Yeah?

17:54.840 --> 17:57.081
Not on purpose, though.
She was wearing this long lace dress

17:57.160 --> 17:59.083
and she got it caught in the furnace.

17:59.160 --> 18:01.447
She died
before they could put the fire out.

18:01.520 --> 18:02.965
Really?

18:03.840 --> 18:06.684
They say she's the one
in the family I look the most like.

18:06.760 --> 18:09.650
Her name was Vivah.
Isn't that a pretty name?

18:09.720 --> 18:11.051
Mmm-hmm.

18:11.120 --> 18:12.724
I don't think
she ever got married, though.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.685
You gonna answer that?

18:23.440 --> 18:25.044
It's for you.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.491
My dad couldn't get away from work.

18:37.560 --> 18:40.404
I was wondering if you could meet us
at Bob's Muffler.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.248
There's some place private
where we can talk?

18:43.320 --> 18:45.971
There's a pool hall next door,
out of business.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.883
Just off Harry Hines.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.208
Bring Dottie,
she'll show you the way.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.042
Don't change plans on me again.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.888
Listen, I'm really sorry.

19:01.720 --> 19:03.449
Could you try
to make a little more noise...

19:03.680 --> 19:06.923
Why don't you try kissing my ass?
Son of a bitch.

19:07.400 --> 19:08.890
Are you gonna kill my momma?

19:14.120 --> 19:15.565
I don't know.

19:18.760 --> 19:21.127
- Why?
- I was just curious.

19:21.840 --> 19:24.366
My momma tried to kill me
when I was real little.

19:24.440 --> 19:25.646
She put a pillow over my face,

19:25.720 --> 19:28.371
because she cared more about herself
than her little baby.

19:28.440 --> 19:31.683
She didn't love me like a momma
should love a little baby.

19:31.760 --> 19:34.081
And she was happy, because
she thought she'd done it.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.447
And then I couldn't grow into
something better than she'd been.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.010
Had ever been.

19:39.720 --> 19:43.441
She hadn't done it.
She didn't send me back to Him.

19:45.440 --> 19:48.762
She just made me sick.
Made me not be for a while.

19:48.840 --> 19:50.410
But then I was.

19:51.200 --> 19:54.602
She was sad that I was,
and I always will be.

19:55.760 --> 19:57.524
How do you know that?

19:58.160 --> 19:59.491
Know what?

20:01.440 --> 20:03.408
That your mother tried to kill you?

20:04.800 --> 20:06.609
Because I remember.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.528
This is my father, Ansel.

21:04.200 --> 21:05.361
Ansel.

21:07.040 --> 21:08.485
Like a beer?

21:08.880 --> 21:11.770
No. No, thank you. Look.

21:11.840 --> 21:13.808
I don't have a lot of time, so...

21:13.880 --> 21:16.360
Alright
Let's get right To it.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.643
If that's all right.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.562
All right.
Well, first Off,

21:23.680 --> 21:26.490
me and my father
never done nothing like this before.

21:26.600 --> 21:30.047
We don't want to do it,
but it's got to be done.

21:34.560 --> 21:37.131
That's got nothing to do with me.

21:37.200 --> 21:38.326
All right.

21:38.440 --> 21:40.249
Well, sir

21:40.360 --> 21:43.170
instead of me kicking this off,
maybe you could tell us the questions

21:43.280 --> 21:45.931
- we need to ask?
- It's pretty simple.

21:46.680 --> 21:50.002
You're gonna pay me for a service
that I'm going to perform.

21:50.120 --> 21:51.326
Uh-huh.

21:51.400 --> 21:54.165
You're going to give me
the particulars of her schedule.

21:54.240 --> 21:57.244
Her habits.
I'll act on them accordingly.

21:58.440 --> 22:01.011
I won't give you many details
on my activities,

22:01.080 --> 22:03.162
because the less you know,

22:03.240 --> 22:04.401
the better for everyone involved.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.365
All right.

22:07.120 --> 22:11.330
Now I only have a couple of rules
that I insist on sticking to.

22:11.400 --> 22:13.004
- Insist.
- Okay. Yeah.

22:13.080 --> 22:16.323
If you're caught,
if you're implicated in this crime,

22:16.400 --> 22:19.290
you are not under any
circumstances to reveal

22:19.400 --> 22:21.528
my identity or participation.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.090
Oh, of course.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.289
If you break this rule,

22:26.600 --> 22:27.840
you'll be killed.

22:28.600 --> 22:29.681
Do you understand?

22:29.760 --> 22:32.366
- I...
- I must be absolutely clear

22:32.440 --> 22:33.487
on this point.

22:35.280 --> 22:36.770
I understand.

22:38.840 --> 22:40.330
Do you understand?

22:42.200 --> 22:43.406
Yeah.

22:45.040 --> 22:49.762
My payment is $25,000 in cash
in advance.

22:49.840 --> 22:50.887
No exceptions.

22:52.720 --> 22:54.643
- 25?
- Yes, sir.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.807
- I thought you said 20.
- I was told 20.

22:57.880 --> 22:59.041
25.

22:59.960 --> 23:01.246
Is that a problem?

23:01.320 --> 23:04.847
We don't have a problem with 25
That's not our problem.

23:05.800 --> 23:07.848
Then what is your problem?

23:08.840 --> 23:11.446
We have a problem with the advance.

23:12.320 --> 23:14.800
- No exceptions.
- Sir, let me explain.

23:14.880 --> 23:17.121
One of the reasons we're
interested in having this done

23:17.200 --> 23:20.682
is my mother holds
a very large insurance policy.

23:20.760 --> 23:21.727
They usually do.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.928
Now we thought
if we can guarantee payment

23:24.000 --> 23:26.082
after the policy had been covered...

23:26.160 --> 23:29.084
Look, this really isn't open
for discussion.

23:30.160 --> 23:33.323
- The conversation is finished.
- Please. this isn't...

23:33.960 --> 23:36.406
What did you think this was huh?

23:36.480 --> 23:38.164
Let's Make A Deal?

23:39.400 --> 23:42.449
This is serious business
you're fucking with here, boy.

23:42.520 --> 23:45.649
- I'm aware of that.
- No, I don't think you are.

23:48.840 --> 23:51.002
I don't take you seriously.

23:52.120 --> 23:55.169
This is gonna get done
one way or another.

23:56.520 --> 24:00.320
Our conversation is finished.
I never met you.

24:01.360 --> 24:02.521
You never met me.

24:28.600 --> 24:32.161
Ofcourse, we never discussed
the possibility of a retainer.

24:33.720 --> 24:35.404
What do you mean?

24:35.480 --> 24:37.482
You know how to reach me.

24:38.400 --> 24:40.528
Call me if she's interested.

24:41.160 --> 24:43.083
Hey, man,
you talking about my sister?

24:45.280 --> 24:47.089
Is that who she is?

24:49.840 --> 24:51.171
Jesus.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.762
What's he mean, "retainer"?

24:58.680 --> 25:01.604
What do you think he means?
He means Dottie.

25:04.280 --> 25:06.089
But retain what exactly?

25:07.240 --> 25:11.131
Just how stupid are you?
Are you really that stupid?

25:15.440 --> 25:18.284
- Watch your fucking mouth!
- What are we gonna do, Dad? Huh?

25:18.360 --> 25:19.805
We gotta think of something.

25:19.880 --> 25:22.326
- We could kill her ourselves!
- Are you gonna kill somebody?

25:22.720 --> 25:24.131
You can't even tell time!

25:24.200 --> 25:26.771
Well, what do you suggest,
smart-ass?

25:29.920 --> 25:32.366
Well, we can forget
about the whole thing.

25:32.440 --> 25:34.010
Or we can

25:34.960 --> 25:36.450
give him Dottie.

25:38.240 --> 25:40.846
Yeah,
it might just do her some good.

25:50.960 --> 25:53.884
Don't be silly.
Nobody's ever gonna see them.

25:54.360 --> 25:56.124
What are you so worried about anyway?

25:56.240 --> 25:59.050
It's not like you can see your face
in any of them.

25:59.160 --> 26:00.810
- Personal call?
- Uh-uh

26:00.880 --> 26:03.167
Two large pepperoni pizzas, please.

26:04.680 --> 26:07.047
That photo shop behind the mall.

26:07.240 --> 26:09.925
You worry too much.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.650
Just some pimply-faced lime girl

26:11.720 --> 26:13.449
who never seen one before
in her life.

26:15.080 --> 26:18.163
Nothing that big anyway.

26:19.320 --> 26:21.641
What time you gonna pick me up?

26:21.880 --> 26:25.202
8:30? What do you expect me to do
until then?

26:25.320 --> 26:26.321
Hold on, Jenny.

26:26.400 --> 26:29.051
Can I have some money
so I can fix supper?

26:29.120 --> 26:31.691
Jenny, I gotta call you
after my shift.

26:31.760 --> 26:34.001
I can't' I have to... Yeah.

26:35.160 --> 26:36.730
Yeah, me, too.

26:39.680 --> 26:41.444
What are you fixing
for supper tonight?

26:41.520 --> 26:43.568
- Just some casserole.
- You gonna make a salad?

26:43.640 --> 26:44.801
Mmm-mmm.

26:45.720 --> 26:47.768
Why don't I give you
a few extra dollars?

26:47.840 --> 26:49.808
Get yourself a new dress.

26:49.920 --> 26:52.605
- We're having a guest for supper.
- Do we have to dress up?

26:53.600 --> 26:56.843
I'm just saying
you'd look real pretty in a dress.

26:59.760 --> 27:01.524
Was it your boyfriend on the phone?

27:01.640 --> 27:02.801
What do you mean?

27:02.880 --> 27:04.086
That wasn't your boyfriend?

27:04.160 --> 27:06.606
- I'm married, silly.
- I won't tell Daddy.

27:06.680 --> 27:07.681
I don't know
what you're talking about.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.808
That was Jenny,
an old friend from high school.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.564
Here you go.

27:11.640 --> 27:13.642
I said no black Olives.

27:17.920 --> 27:21.242
Fire up another supreme.
No black olives. I'm taking my break.

27:21.880 --> 27:23.370
- Eat.
- Is he cute?

27:23.440 --> 27:25.329
Stop talking like that.

27:25.400 --> 27:27.368
You should have a cute boyfriend.

27:28.880 --> 27:31.247
I had a boyfriend in the third grade.

27:31.320 --> 27:33.163
I never told nobody.

27:33.240 --> 27:35.527
His name was Marshall. He was fat.

27:35.600 --> 27:36.886
He loved me.

27:36.960 --> 27:38.200
You need to go out more often.

27:38.280 --> 27:40.442
Nobody ever knew
we were going together.

27:40.520 --> 27:44.002
We didn't see each other at recess,
we didn't sit together at lunch.

27:44.080 --> 27:46.845
We never wrote notes and he didn't
walk me home from school.

27:46.920 --> 27:48.684
When would you see him?

27:48.760 --> 27:49.921
In class, at school.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.081
I mean, alone.

27:51.160 --> 27:52.764
We didn't see each other alone.

27:52.840 --> 27:55.571
- Ever?
- That would have spoiled the secret.

27:56.080 --> 27:57.081
How'd you know
you were going together,

27:57.160 --> 27:59.049
if you never spent any time alone?

27:59.120 --> 28:01.566
We just knew. If we talked about it,

28:01.640 --> 28:03.688
it wouldn't have been what it was,
which was true

28:03.760 --> 28:04.761
What was true?

28:05.160 --> 28:07.925
Love. We loved each other.

28:08.040 --> 28:10.725
How do you know he loved you,
if y'all never talked about it?

28:10.800 --> 28:12.450
Because he loved me with pure love.

28:14.080 --> 28:15.206
Well,

28:15.880 --> 28:18.451
not many like that around, I guess.

28:22.280 --> 28:24.806
It's Joe, isn't it?
Joe's coming over.

28:24.920 --> 28:26.046
Joe who?

28:26.120 --> 28:27.804
I don't remember.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.565
His eyes hurt.

28:29.640 --> 28:30.687
Huh?

28:30.760 --> 28:31.966
What?

28:33.200 --> 28:35.123
- Met him?
- Mmm-hmm.

28:35.720 --> 28:37.051
What's he like?

28:37.120 --> 28:39.248
He told me I should get a teacher
for my kung fu.

28:39.360 --> 28:40.885
Yeah?

28:40.960 --> 28:42.724
And he had me make him some coffee.

28:42.800 --> 28:44.928
- What's he like?
- I don't know.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.001
Hey, Ansel.

28:51.160 --> 28:53.686
Now you just forget about Jenny
She's an old friend

28:53.760 --> 28:55.000
and I don't need any trouble
from your daddy

28:55.080 --> 28:56.161
over an old friend, you hear?

28:56.280 --> 28:57.930
- You should have a cute boyfriend.
- Shh!

28:59.720 --> 29:01.802
Hey, y'all talking about me?

29:01.880 --> 29:04.850
- Your ears must've been burning.
- No, sir.

29:04.920 --> 29:08.402
I was just telling Dottie here
how pretty she'd look in a new dress.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.608
Yeah, I'll ride you
over to the Thrifty

29:10.680 --> 29:13.206
and maybe we'll pick you out
something pretty, all right?

29:13.280 --> 29:14.850
Is everyone getting dressed up?

29:14.920 --> 29:17.400
Yeah, we're all getting dressed up.

29:17.480 --> 29:20.165
Hey, can I get some money?
We're out of beer.

29:20.240 --> 29:22.288
My purse is downstairs.

29:22.840 --> 29:25.571
When are you gonna tell that girl
it's just gonna be her and Joe?

29:25.640 --> 29:28.007
- She'll figure it out
- You gotta tell her.

29:28.120 --> 29:29.281
That girl's not like other people.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.124
God damn it,
she don't put two and two together

29:31.200 --> 29:32.565
like you, me and Chris.

29:33.920 --> 29:35.285
What are you so worried about?

29:35.360 --> 29:37.761
She never been on a date before.

29:38.200 --> 29:39.884
- It ain't a date.
- It's the closest thing

29:39.960 --> 29:41.121
she'll ever come to one.

29:41.200 --> 29:43.851
Except for some fat kid
that didn't even know it.

29:43.920 --> 29:45.001
What fat kid?

29:46.160 --> 29:47.241
You talk to that girl

29:47.320 --> 29:49.482
else you're liable
to blow this whole thing real good.

29:49.600 --> 29:52.444
- What am I supposed to say?
- Tell her the story, for God's sake.

29:52.560 --> 29:54.562
Why do you have to make everything
so difficult?

29:54.640 --> 29:56.768
- What story?
- The situation.

29:56.840 --> 29:58.444
Tell her
why Joe is coming over tonight.

29:58.800 --> 30:00.723
- How am I supposed to get to that?
- If she don't know

30:00.840 --> 30:04.003
what's expected of her,
she might disappoint him.

30:05.920 --> 30:08.844
I'm riding her over to
the Thrifty, ain't I?

30:09.360 --> 30:11.408
Ugh!

30:11.960 --> 30:14.930
What about my beer money?
...Sharla.

30:16.200 --> 30:17.247
What fat kid?

30:46.600 --> 30:47.931
Hope you have a spare.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.240
Daddy?

30:51.280 --> 30:52.486
Daddy.

30:53.600 --> 30:56.683
Hey, hey, look at you.

30:57.280 --> 30:59.681
You look like a
goddamn movie star.

31:00.280 --> 31:01.361
Turn around.

31:02.040 --> 31:03.280
Turn around.

31:04.240 --> 31:07.084
Yeah, just like
a goddamn movie star.

31:08.440 --> 31:09.930
I feel funny.

31:10.520 --> 31:13.091
Oh, don't say that,
You look beautiful.

31:13.520 --> 31:15.204
My butt's too big.

31:15.280 --> 31:18.409
Well, let me let you in
on a little secret.

31:18.520 --> 31:21.251
- Guys like big butts
- They do not.

31:21.960 --> 31:23.849
I'm speaking from experience.

31:23.920 --> 31:25.888
Sharla doesn't have a big butt.

31:25.960 --> 31:28.486
Yeah, well, give her some time.

31:30.640 --> 31:32.051
Why aren't you dressed yet?

31:34.240 --> 31:36.891
'Cause I'm not gonna stay for supper.

31:39.640 --> 31:41.244
What do you mean?

31:41.320 --> 31:43.322
Chris and I got some business
to attend to

31:43.400 --> 31:44.401
Where's Chris?

31:44.480 --> 31:47.529
So it's just gonna be you
and Joe for supper.

31:49.880 --> 31:52.008
- I should change.
- No. No.

31:52.320 --> 31:54.766
- No. honey.
- Yeah, I should.

31:55.120 --> 31:59.728
Dottie, I think it'd be nice for Joe,
if he saw you looking pretty.

31:59.800 --> 32:02.121
- Yeah, I'm going to...
- Listen, honey. Dottie!

32:03.320 --> 32:06.767
- Just settle down. Dottie!
- Let go of me, I have to change!

32:07.360 --> 32:10.091
- Dottie, wait a second!
- Change! I have to change!

32:10.160 --> 32:11.446
I have to change!

32:11.520 --> 32:14.205
Dottie' don't close
that fucking door on me.

32:14.280 --> 32:16.282
I have to change!

32:16.360 --> 32:17.964
God damn it!

32:18.080 --> 32:20.287
Hold still, you little bitch.

32:20.920 --> 32:23.127
- What the hell's going on in here?
- What the fuck!

32:23.200 --> 32:25.202
What the hell's going on?

32:25.560 --> 32:28.370
- She wants to take off her dress.
- So?

32:28.440 --> 32:30.044
Well, don't you think she looks nice?

32:30.120 --> 32:32.043
Let her change, if she wants.
You put on whatever you like.

32:33.200 --> 32:36.807
- Don't you think she looks nice?
- Hey, let her change, Dad!

32:36.880 --> 32:38.086
Let her change!

32:38.160 --> 32:40.322
- Hang on a goddamn second.
- Hey

32:40.400 --> 32:43.165
Let her change.
...Change.

32:51.400 --> 32:52.686
What are you doing here?

32:52.760 --> 32:54.569
We're on our way out.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.211
- We discussed this.
- Well, don't push it. We're leaving.

32:57.280 --> 33:00.124
That's right, junior. Don't push it.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.011
Now, we make arrangements,

33:03.080 --> 33:06.448
I expect the details
to have some attention paid to them.

33:06.520 --> 33:08.090
Let's go, Dad.

33:08.600 --> 33:10.170
You understand?

33:10.240 --> 33:11.401
Yeah.

33:12.360 --> 33:13.771
Good boy.

33:15.520 --> 33:16.851
Where is she?

33:16.920 --> 33:18.604
She's changing.

33:27.160 --> 33:29.686
Too bad he didn't
meet Sharla first.

33:29.760 --> 33:32.570
He could've dated her,
I wouldn't have minded so much.

33:32.640 --> 33:35.564
That's my wife you're
talking about, fuck head.

33:35.640 --> 33:37.290
Yeah. Right.

34:09.080 --> 34:10.286
Dottie?

34:10.800 --> 34:12.563
It's me, Joe Cooper.

34:13.360 --> 34:14.485
We're alone now.

34:16.920 --> 34:19.321
You don't wanna come out,
it's okay.

34:19.400 --> 34:22.005
You stay in there
as long as you like.

34:36.239 --> 34:38.163
Casserole smells nice.

34:40.639 --> 34:43.405
I wish I had a funny story
about first dates

34:43.480 --> 34:45.766
or casseroles, but I don't.

34:46.880 --> 34:48.882
Maybe one will come to me.

34:51.080 --> 34:52.491
Maybe not.

34:59.680 --> 35:03.162
Lee Hazlewood. Okie from Muskogee.

35:05.360 --> 35:08.330
I don't have a funny story
about Lee Hazlewood, either.

35:08.400 --> 35:09.811
Or Oklahoma.

35:10.240 --> 35:12.686
I guess Oklahoma's
kind of funny anyway though.

35:14.880 --> 35:18.248
I grew up, looking at Oklahoma.

35:21.760 --> 35:24.081
From the south bank
of the Red River.

35:25.360 --> 35:29.570
When I was a boy,
the border between Texas

35:29.640 --> 35:33.042
and Oklahoma
was actually the middle of the river.

35:33.120 --> 35:36.203
You fish the north bank,
you caught Okie fish.

35:38.240 --> 35:40.049
I caught Texas fish.

35:41.200 --> 35:45.410
Sometime since then,
we gave our half of the river away.

35:46.680 --> 35:49.650
Now the whole damn thing
belongs to Oklahoma.

35:51.560 --> 35:52.925
South bank.

35:54.040 --> 35:56.088
That's the border now.

35:58.760 --> 36:00.967
I'm not sure why we did that.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.404
But it makes me mad.

36:09.560 --> 36:11.722
Ifs kind of like giving away

36:13.200 --> 36:14.850
your front porch.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.841
- How are you?
- Fine.

36:29.240 --> 36:30.605
You wanna know how I am?

36:31.080 --> 36:32.445
How are you?

36:33.320 --> 36:35.607
I'm fine. Thank you.

36:44.080 --> 36:45.684
You look nice.

36:48.880 --> 36:49.927
Thank you.

36:51.080 --> 36:52.764
I changed.

36:52.840 --> 36:56.242
I didn't know it was just gonna be
you and me for dinner

36:56.320 --> 36:58.527
Someone should have told you.

36:59.040 --> 37:00.804
They did Just now.

37:05.200 --> 37:07.009
What did you change from?

37:07.120 --> 37:08.360
A dress.

37:10.640 --> 37:12.324
I'd love to see it.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.170
Your eyes hurt.

37:24.120 --> 37:25.770
I beg your pardon?

37:29.920 --> 37:32.400
Dottie, do you trust me?

37:34.480 --> 37:35.845
Not quite.

37:36.600 --> 37:37.726
Good.

37:52.680 --> 37:53.920
Lovely.

37:54.520 --> 37:56.045
I'm a virgin.

37:56.960 --> 37:58.041
I know.

38:09.360 --> 38:10.646
Ay!

38:11.280 --> 38:13.886
- Tuna casserole.
- Yes.

38:15.360 --> 38:17.362
- May I serve?
- Please.

38:21.760 --> 38:23.091
Thank you.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.246
Mmm.

38:26.520 --> 38:29.649
I'd really like to see that dress.

38:29.720 --> 38:31.404
It wasn't right.

38:31.480 --> 38:33.244
May I see it anyway?

38:35.760 --> 38:37.364
How you gonna kill my momma?

38:37.760 --> 38:42.322
That's not appropriate
dinner conversation, Dottie.

38:44.720 --> 38:47.485
Unless you poison her.

38:51.960 --> 38:54.930
Will you be the detective
who investigates?

38:55.000 --> 38:56.331
Probably not.

38:56.400 --> 38:57.765
Sometimes.

38:59.280 --> 39:01.009
Is that a problem?

39:02.480 --> 39:04.244
That's convenience.

39:05.200 --> 39:06.804
So are homes.

39:08.360 --> 39:09.486
Yes.

39:09.560 --> 39:11.324
I love my brother.

39:11.440 --> 39:14.922
I remember when Momma and Daddy
were getting a divorce.

39:19.120 --> 39:21.441
She just told us. She was drunk.

39:22.600 --> 39:24.489
She said,
"I don't love your daddy no more".

39:25.120 --> 39:26.884
"I never loved him."

39:27.600 --> 39:30.331
And I screamed something
that didn't make any sense.

39:30.400 --> 39:32.971
Ran out of the house
to the front yard.

39:33.800 --> 39:36.610
Chris came out.
He hadn't said anything.

39:38.600 --> 39:42.924
He just laid on top of me.
He stretched his body out like this.

39:45.960 --> 39:48.361
Laid on top of me
till I stopped crying.

39:48.440 --> 39:49.521
- Dottie...

39:49.600 --> 39:51.443
We never talked about it ever.

39:52.160 --> 39:53.730
Bring the dress.

39:56.800 --> 39:58.484
- Now?
- Yes.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.689
Why wouldn't you wear that for me?

40:30.840 --> 40:32.490
'Cause it's not me.

40:33.200 --> 40:35.282
Not when you're not in it.

40:37.520 --> 40:40.205
- I once had a boyfriend.
- Put it on.

40:43.360 --> 40:44.725
Alright.

40:45.160 --> 40:46.207
Where are you going?

40:48.200 --> 40:51.170
- I was going to put on the dress.
- I said put it on.

40:51.920 --> 40:52.921
I was.

40:55.400 --> 40:56.561
Here.

41:16.320 --> 41:19.608
I wanna see you put it on.

41:46.200 --> 41:47.440
Stop.

41:48.920 --> 41:50.684
Take off your socks.

42:16.400 --> 42:18.323
Take off your brassiere.

42:32.640 --> 42:33.971
Take off your underwear.

42:47.200 --> 42:48.486
Babies?

42:52.280 --> 42:53.964
Put on the dress.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.411
Come here.

43:17.760 --> 43:19.410
Right behind me.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.287
Put your hand inside my pants.

43:46.240 --> 43:47.890
Do you feel that?

43:49.680 --> 43:50.727
Yes.

43:51.720 --> 43:53.563
What's that feel like?

43:54.760 --> 43:56.489
I don't remember.

43:59.240 --> 44:01.004
How old are you now?

44:03.160 --> 44:04.241
12.

44:07.800 --> 44:09.245
So am I.

44:14.560 --> 44:16.449
Switch places with me.

44:38.800 --> 44:40.450
Your boyfriend?

44:42.880 --> 44:45.611
- Marshall.
- Marshall.

44:47.760 --> 44:49.205
He was fat.

44:49.520 --> 44:50.851
Uh-huh.

44:53.240 --> 44:55.322
He loved me with pure love.

45:00.160 --> 45:01.844
It was our secret.

45:07.280 --> 45:08.486
Nobody.

45:14.840 --> 45:16.330
Oh.

46:03.200 --> 46:04.645
Come on!

46:09.840 --> 46:13.083
1,000 on On the Nose,
on 5 on the eighth at Lone Star.

46:13.480 --> 46:15.323
ANNOUNCER
On My Mind there in sixth.

46:15.400 --> 46:17.767
And it's Mango, Cliff, Rick's CafÃ©

46:17.840 --> 46:20.889
and way, way back there, Bella Luna.

46:21.160 --> 46:23.606
Less than half a mile to go
as they move into the far turn.

46:23.680 --> 46:26.809
Betty Boo leads a nose
on the outside. Yes I Can...

46:30.720 --> 46:32.882
It's still Tilt a Whirl
with a tenuous lead.

46:32.960 --> 46:34.803
Legal Tender and Endearing Manners

46:34.880 --> 46:36.120
strikes the front
just outside the eighth pole.

46:36.200 --> 46:37.201
Come on, 5.

46:37.320 --> 46:39.049
Cavalier coming down hard
the centre of the track

46:39.120 --> 46:40.121
and Daddy Mike is right there.

46:40.200 --> 46:41.964
- Come on, 5. Come on, 5, come on 5!
- Towards the inside,

46:42.040 --> 46:43.087
- coming on through
- Piece of shit.

46:43.160 --> 46:44.650
...but it's Endearing Manner
that's come on now

46:44.720 --> 46:47.121
- to take the lead as they come...
- He held back!

46:47.240 --> 46:49.686
- And in a spectacular finish...
- He held back!

46:49.760 --> 46:53.651
A spectacular upset, Endearing
Manner has won the impossible!

46:53.720 --> 46:56.724
17 to 1,
resolved at Lone Star here today.

46:56.800 --> 46:58.040
God damn, motherfuck!

47:03.440 --> 47:05.920
- Hey.
- Time's up brother.

47:06.320 --> 47:09.085
You asked for an extra week
three weeks ago brother.

47:09.480 --> 47:12.245
- You told me you had a plan
- No, listen, I called you.

47:12.320 --> 47:14.288
- I called you at 11:00
- This the plan?

47:14.360 --> 47:15.646
Come on, G-Man.

47:15.840 --> 47:19.242
Yeah, the money is coming to you
by about, Motherfucking...

47:19.760 --> 47:21.285
Son of a bitch!

48:49.840 --> 48:51.444
You little motherfucker!

48:51.520 --> 48:53.010
Where you going?

48:54.480 --> 48:56.005
Piece of shit!

49:00.360 --> 49:02.362
Here you go, here you go!

49:16.240 --> 49:17.241
Chris.

49:19.720 --> 49:20.926
Hi Digger.

49:23.400 --> 49:26.131
How you been, boy?

49:27.560 --> 49:29.130
Pretty good. How about yourself?

49:29.200 --> 49:31.487
Oh, fair to middling.

49:31.560 --> 49:32.925
Blood pressure.

49:33.880 --> 49:34.881
You taking medicine?

49:34.960 --> 49:37.042
Yeah, alt that.
No salt, low stress.

49:37.560 --> 49:41.246
Course, Amy keeps making that fried
chicken. You know I can't resist it.

49:42.160 --> 49:43.730
How is Amy?

49:43.800 --> 49:46.929
Well, she's all busted up
right at the moment.

49:48.320 --> 49:50.641
You remember Dumpling,
that old bluetick we had?

49:51.000 --> 49:52.126
Yeah, sure, Dumpling.

49:52.240 --> 49:54.971
Yeah, well, we had to put him
to sleep yesterday morning

49:55.160 --> 49:56.764
- Oh, no.
- Yup.

49:56.920 --> 49:58.126
Well, you missed yourself
a hell of a party

49:58.200 --> 49:59.201
a couple of weeks ago.

49:59.280 --> 50:00.486
Sorry I missed your birthday.

50:00.600 --> 50:02.409
Well, I'm glad
you missed my birthday.

50:02.520 --> 50:05.000
I just wish you hadn't
missed the party.

50:05.080 --> 50:07.401
How many people we have
out there at the place, G-Man?

50:07.480 --> 50:08.481
A couple hundred.

50:08.600 --> 50:10.523
Oh, hell, it wasn't that many.

50:10.640 --> 50:12.608
- 150 anyway.
- No shit.

50:12.760 --> 50:14.171
Sorry l missed it.

50:14.280 --> 50:17.284
Yeah, good old party.
Lots of barbeque.

50:17.440 --> 50:19.841
Hey, G-Man here,
he played the accordion.

50:20.120 --> 50:21.531
That's right.

50:21.600 --> 50:23.841
- Hey, wasn't that gal out there?
- What gal?

50:23.920 --> 50:26.446
Well, the one that's always
sniffing around Chris's shit here.

50:27.160 --> 50:28.161
What the hell's her name?

50:28.240 --> 50:30.163
The one with the great big caboose
on her...

50:30.280 --> 50:31.884
- Arlene?
- Arlene.

50:31.960 --> 50:33.644
Yeah, Arlene.

50:34.200 --> 50:37.204
You'd better look out for her, boy.
She may be too much woman for you.

50:37.280 --> 50:39.521
Well, she'd better stay away
from the barbeque

50:39.640 --> 50:41.608
or she'd be too much woman
to fit through the door.

50:45.440 --> 50:47.568
Damn, you make me laugh.

50:47.640 --> 50:50.849
Hey, listen, I'm just gonna have the
boys here kick the shit out of you.

50:50.920 --> 50:53.207
You'd better pay me my money
in a couple of days

50:53.320 --> 50:54.526
or I'm gonna wrap you up
in electrician tape

50:54.600 --> 50:58.082
and bury you in a coffin
about 10 feet deep. Huh?

50:59.920 --> 51:02.321
I'll tell Amy you asked about her.

51:06.320 --> 51:07.731
That'll make her smile.

51:15.160 --> 51:16.207
He really likes you.

51:56.240 --> 51:59.483
- Stay the hell down!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

51:59.560 --> 52:01.289
- Easy, Easy.
- Oh, my God, what happened?

52:01.360 --> 52:06.002
- Fuck!
- Chris! Shit. You look rough, boy.

52:06.080 --> 52:07.241
Them old boys caught up to you huh.

52:07.320 --> 52:10.483
Dad! I think they broke my hand!

52:10.560 --> 52:11.925
- What did they do to your face?
- Excuse me.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.764
- You want to go to the hospital?
- I think he does.

52:13.840 --> 52:17.049
- I got beat up.
- What happened to you? - I got beat up!

52:17.160 --> 52:18.207
Can we get a wet rag?

52:18.320 --> 52:19.890
They put the fucking boot to you,
or what?

52:20.320 --> 52:22.561
That son of a bitch Digger Soames?

52:22.680 --> 52:24.648
They do all they were going to?

52:24.720 --> 52:26.404
If they wanted to kill him,
he'd be dead.

52:26.480 --> 52:28.289
- Your nose is broken.
- Is that all?

52:28.560 --> 52:29.891
What'd they say to you?

52:30.040 --> 52:33.123
What the fuck do you think they said?

52:33.200 --> 52:35.601
- I reckon they want their money.
- No shit!

52:35.680 --> 52:36.681
Hey, you want a beer?

52:36.760 --> 52:38.171
Where'd they find you?

52:38.240 --> 52:40.129
Fucking Sport of Kings.

52:40.200 --> 52:41.281
Did you see Bill there?

52:41.760 --> 52:43.489
I don't know, why?

52:43.560 --> 52:44.891
He owes me 10 bucks.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.446
I'm going to bed. Come on Ansel.

52:47.560 --> 52:48.561
We have to go to the hospital.

52:48.640 --> 52:50.688
No' he's fine.
He just got a whupping.

52:50.760 --> 52:52.649
- Ansel! Come on!
- All right, then.

52:52.720 --> 52:54.848
I guess we're gonna turn in.

52:57.520 --> 52:59.409
Dottie, go on.

53:01.120 --> 53:02.849
Good night Chris.

53:41.960 --> 53:45.328
I want to know what kind
of progress you're making.

53:46.360 --> 53:48.124
It's being taken care of.

53:48.200 --> 53:49.247
Yeah, right.

53:49.440 --> 53:50.521
You've been fucking my sister

53:50.640 --> 53:52.881
and my mother's a hell of a lot
healthier than me at the moment.

53:53.640 --> 53:56.644
Do you want me off the job?
Say the word.

53:57.920 --> 53:59.490
When are you planning on doing it?

54:00.200 --> 54:01.440
Tonight.

54:02.160 --> 54:03.366
Really?

54:05.040 --> 54:07.168
So you'd be leaving tomorrow then?

54:07.240 --> 54:10.403
No, no, no,
the retainer's for the money.

54:11.120 --> 54:13.726
I'm not leaving until I get my money.

54:13.920 --> 54:15.081
I don't like that.

54:15.160 --> 54:16.207
Well, I don't care.

54:16.360 --> 54:18.328
I don't want you near my sister.

54:18.440 --> 54:20.249
I don't care.

54:21.600 --> 54:24.001
And if I tell you the deal's off?

54:24.560 --> 54:28.167
Then I'll leave right now
and you'll never see me again.

54:29.640 --> 54:30.971
Your call.

54:39.040 --> 54:41.202
Who you into for this money?

54:41.880 --> 54:43.530
I won't tell you.

54:44.640 --> 54:46.165
Digger Soames?

54:47.200 --> 54:48.850
How'd you know that?

54:48.920 --> 54:50.922
What did he say he'd do to you,
if you don't pay him?

54:51.000 --> 54:52.331
You know that too?

54:52.640 --> 54:54.085
He'll do it.

54:56.480 --> 54:59.290
Aren't you supposed to arrest people
who commit murder?

55:02.160 --> 55:03.730
I like Digger.

55:12.560 --> 55:13.561
Do it.

55:42.080 --> 55:43.366
- Mr Tim.
- Hey Joe.

56:17.640 --> 56:20.291
Joe, Joe. Thank God.

56:21.240 --> 56:23.846
I was afraid I wouldn't get here.
I'd be too late, Thank God.

56:23.920 --> 56:26.571
Listen, we got to stop this.
Alright?

56:26.640 --> 56:28.165
I've been in a lot of trouble
all my life,

56:28.280 --> 56:30.089
but I never did nothing
like this before.

56:30.160 --> 56:33.004
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to waste your time.

56:33.080 --> 56:35.890
I mean, I hate that bitch.
I always hated her.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.401
I just can't be the one, you know?

56:38.480 --> 56:40.847
But the main thing really is Dottie.

56:40.920 --> 56:44.083
You know, my sister
never did nothing to nobody.

56:44.160 --> 56:45.571
- (CAR LOCK BEEPS}
- You got to give her up,

56:45.640 --> 56:47.130
'cause I can't look her in the eyes otherwise.

56:47.200 --> 56:49.931
I mean, you can't have her.
I can't let you have her.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.765
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

56:55.080 --> 56:56.286
Hop in.

57:00.680 --> 57:02.409
Shit. OW!

57:03.200 --> 57:04.201
Fuck!

57:05.680 --> 57:08.684
I started a farm once.
It seemed like the life I wanted.

57:08.800 --> 57:12.282
Work for myself outside a lot.
Live in the country, smoke dope.

57:12.360 --> 57:16.285
Watch TV. That's all I really want.
So I started a rabbit farm.

57:16.360 --> 57:17.771
I built it with my own two hands.

57:17.840 --> 57:21.322
Lumber, chicken wire,
water bottles, pellets, rabbits.

57:21.400 --> 57:22.970
I loved those little bastards.

57:23.040 --> 57:24.769
They smell like shit
and they fuck all the time,

57:24.840 --> 57:26.604
but they're awful easy going animals.

57:26.680 --> 57:29.524
A rat, a skunk or something
got into the pen

57:29.600 --> 57:31.364
and it was rabid
and awful hot out too.

57:31.440 --> 57:33.204
And they just tore each other up.

57:33.280 --> 57:36.443
Their eyes rolling and foaming
at the mouth and screaming.

57:36.520 --> 57:39.922
You know rabbits scream?
They sound just like little girls.

57:40.040 --> 57:42.122
I mean, it was disturbing.

57:42.560 --> 57:45.962
I started selling dope for a living.
I knew more about it, so...

57:46.040 --> 57:48.611
So I can't pay this guy
and I don't even really want to.

57:50.400 --> 57:51.970
You gotta get out Joe.

57:52.040 --> 57:54.725
You gotta leave my sister
alone forever.

58:24.440 --> 58:26.090
What's going on?

58:31.600 --> 58:32.761
Jesus.

58:45.720 --> 58:46.846
Easy.

58:57.880 --> 59:00.690
- Put her feet on the floorboard.
- Alright.

59:02.960 --> 59:04.724
- Alright?
- Yeah.

59:13.320 --> 59:15.721
Put that in the trunk and shut it.

59:59.160 --> 01:00:00.889
Give me some light.

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:20.488
- I was watching that, Chris.
- Listen.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.091
- I was watching a show.
- I know.

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.686
- I wanted to see how it turned out!
- He don't catch the bird, okay?

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:28.207
- It just goes on and on and on.
- Yeah?

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:37.165
Listen, honey.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:41.446
I know, you know what's going on,
okay?

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:44.447
I don't got to explain it to you.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.681
Mmm-hmm.

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:49.691
If I'd known
how this would all fall out

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.051
I might have done things different.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.121
No.

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:13.810
What's wrong?

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.325
For God's sake.

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.286
Shit.

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:24.601
- Good Morning y'all.
- Good morning.

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:26.000
Morning.

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.124
What was her maiden name, Ansel?

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.203
I need it for the file.

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:46.088
Yes, sir. Rogers.

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.367
Adele Carolyn Rogers.

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:03.450
- Is there gonna be a trial?
- No. No.

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:06.643
- Joe knows what he's doing.
- I ain't never been to a trial.

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.842
Did you see the shot in the paper?
Her car?

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:11.287
Joe knows what he's doing' all right?
They couldn't do no autopsy,

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:14.204
'cause there wasn't much
left to speak of.

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:17.008
- How'd it go?
- Let's just get out of here.

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:21.483
- Little son of a bitch.
- What's the matter?

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:24.202
I am not talking in front of Dottie.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.890
She knows what's going on.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.401
- I'm not talking in front of her.
- What happened with Filpatrick?

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.764
I ain't talking in front of Dottie!

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:33.764
They're not gonna pay you
the money, are they?

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:35.968
- Dad?
- Ansel, calm down.

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:39.170
- Dad?
- Ansel! Don't make a scene!

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.562
Who told you about Adele's policy?

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:46.881
Rex! Rex told me.

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.850
He just mentioned it in conversation.
Will you, for the love of God...

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:51.001
When?

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.447
- In conversation.
- Not how, when?

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.725
A few weeks ago.
Me and Mom just had a big fight...

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.564
- Oh, Christ.
- I told you, Ansel.

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.091
- What happened?
- I told you from the start.

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:02.162
- Shut up!
- Don't tell me to shut up!

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.083
- I'm not the one who blew this thing.
- What happened, Dad?

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.242
You show up at our place,
tell everyone what to do.

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:08.249
How we're all gonna see
a hundred grand!

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:09.481
God damn it, you tell me right now.

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:12.450
Dottie is not the beneficiary!

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:15.771
- Rex is the beneficiary!
- I don't understand.

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.651
- It's not real tough.
- Explain it to me.

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:21.161
Dottie does not get the money.

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:23.569
- Rex gets the money.
- Wait.

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:29.283
Dottie does not get $50,000 boy!

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.967
Rex! Rex!

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.371
Rex gets the $50,000.

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:39.404
- That's not right.
- That's the way it is! That can't be.

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:42.570
- Go talk to Filpatrick yourself!
- I was told!

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:45.880
Because he told me!

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.962
Rex told me, he told me!

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:50.248
Rex was Momma's boyfriend.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:52.926
Just shut up Dottie, He told me!

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.241
- He was lying. - Why would he do that?
- Why do you think?

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:58.324
No. No, he couldn't have
known I'd do this.

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.367
Who told you about Killer Joe?

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:06.846
Oh.

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:09.486
Oh, God.

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:12.328
I told you. - Yeah.
Did I tell you?

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:15.006
Oh my God, I'm fucked.

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:19.090
Piece of fucking fuck-suck-cake!

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.729
I don't believe you God.

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:23.370
You'd better believe it!

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:25.528
'Cause the sooner you believe it,
the sooner you figure out a way

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.284
to pay Killer Joe his money!

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:30.688
- We gotta get going.
- Not to mention Digger Soames.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.728
- Gotta get going y'all.
- For what?

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:34.080
Funeral's in a half hour.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.969
Y'all get going.
I gotta think of something.

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:40.491
I wish you would.

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:43.325
We're all so much better off
whenever you do.

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:45.927
Where's Joe?
He's coming back, isn't he?

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.206
Yeah.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:50.807
- He's coming back all right.
- Yeah, he's coming back all right.

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:53.804
Let's hit it. We gotta get
your mother tn the ground

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.122
- I'll take Dottie.
- Dottie!

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.169
Yeah, we'll be along.

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:04.481
Ms Smith, when you're done
fumigating the gates of hell.

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:09.849
Hey, Chris.

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:12.488
Why don't you do us
all a big favour?

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:14.449
Just go kill yourself.

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:30.685
Do you feel bad?

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:33.241
Yeah.

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.966
I feel like maybe I'm not supposed
to be on Earth or something.

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:42.967
Do you remember them shows
you used to put on with your knees?

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:44.411
Huh?

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:49.605
We'd be laying in bed and you'd get
a flashlight and put your knees up

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:51.489
and put a pair of sunglasses
on one knee

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:54.006
and some kind of hat on the other?

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.086
Yeah.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.683
Put on a little show.

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:02.084
"Greatest Show on Earthâ€œ
is what you called it.

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.281
Yeah?

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:09.686
Into time and forever, from now on,
no more adventures,

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.842
time outs or king's exes.

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:14.926
Everlasting one more time
than you can say,

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.288
into infinity and outer space, Amen.

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.208
Nothing's worse than regret.

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:28.127
Not cancer,
not being eaten by a shark, nothing.

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:36.448
Joe's coming back isn't he?
'Cause I...

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:37.931
I'm leaving.

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.331
- I think maybe...
- I want you to come with me.

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.686
Where?

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:44.006
Mexico.

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:46.649
No, further. Peru.

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:48.850
In South America.

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.806
- How we gonna get there?
- We'll drive.

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:53.846
We can drive it.

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:56.400
- Chris...
- Do you like Texas?

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:02.810
These people talk about it like
it's such a great place and all,

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:05.247
but it's really just a bunch of
goddamn hicks and rednecks,

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:07.971
with too much space
to walk around in!

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:10.682
- It's warm.
- Let's go.

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:13.531
Let's just go.

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:16.441
- Now.
- To the funeral?

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:19.649
Hey, if we're gonna pull this off
we gotta gas up.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.290
- I have to see Joe.
- No, Dottie.

01:08:21.359 --> 01:08:22.407
I have to see him.

01:08:22.479 --> 01:08:23.925
We have to go to Peru now!

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.560
Well, then you go by yourself.
'Cause I have to see Joe!

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:41.649
I'll make you a deal.

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:44.729
We'll go to the funeral
and you can see Joe after.

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:56.206
No funny stuff, Promise.

01:09:00.359 --> 01:09:01.691
You swear?

01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:04.481
I swear.

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:08.444
You can't tell Joe
we're going to Peru, okay?

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.648
You can't tell him goodbye,
not outright.

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:12.564
- Okie-dokie.

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.768
And you can't tell
Dad or Sharla, either,

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:17.321
'cause they're mad at me right now
and might try to spoil our trip.

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:19.529
- I understand.

01:09:20.399 --> 01:09:22.926
You excited?
You wanna go?

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:25.684
I'm always excited.

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:30.122
We can do this. We can pull this off.

01:09:33.279 --> 01:09:35.442
Not if somebody makes me mad.

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:44.045
Rex didn't even bother to show up.
Son of a bitch.

01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:51.331
Bow down thy ear to me.
Deliver me speedily.

01:09:52.399 --> 01:09:56.007
Be thou my strong rock
for a house of defence to save me.

01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:59.611
I would be glad to
rejoice in thy mercy.

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:01.969
For thou has considered my trouble.

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:05.965
Thou has known
my soul in adversities.

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:10.087
And thou has not shut me up
into the hand of the enemy.

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:12.891
Thou has set my feet
in the Lord's room.

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.842
Have mercy on me, oh, Lord.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:18.808
I am forgotten
as a dead man out of mind.

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.644
We are gathered here
to put to eternal rest

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.409
Adele Carolyn Rogers-Smith.

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:31.206
Beloved mother of two children,
Christopher and Dorothy.

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.208
Devoted to her family and community.

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:35.366
Hey Rex.

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.210
Hands on the car.

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:18.562
- Fucking asshole.
- Whatever.

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.241
Dottie!

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:25.081
It's us!

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:30.931
We stopped by the K-Fry-C.
You hungry?

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:35.840
Dottie!

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:37.447
Chris!

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.364
- Hey. Fetch me a beer, would you?
- He's not here.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:44.570
- Hey Joe.
- Dottie here?

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.450
She's asleep.

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:49.202
- Where's Chris?
- I don't know.

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:51.328
Do you want some chicken?
We stopped by the K-Fry-C.

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.004
Yes, please.

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:55.924
Sure, help yourself.
It's right here on the stove.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.604
Fetch it for him, would you, hon?

01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:59.444
Sure, white or dark?

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:01.527
Leg.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.570
You want a beer?

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:05.005
Yes, please.

01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:08.803
Set that on the table, please?

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:13.884
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:21.245
Funerals make people hungry
for some reason.

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.441
Huh.

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:24.010
I'm starving.

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:33.080
Mmm.

01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:35.288
- You hear about the insurance?
- Sharla.

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:38.170
- Yes, I did.
- I don't know what to say.

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.242
You don't have to say anything.
It's not your fault.

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.482
- Yeah, but
- Chris.

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:45.689
That Chris is so stupid, I could
have told you he'd fuck this up.

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:47.762
- Why didn't you?
- Why didn't I?

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:50.207
It's just an expression, really.

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:52.847
What is?

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:56.760
What she said. That she could
have told you Chris would fuck it up.

01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:58.763
I've never heard of that expression.

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:02.128
- A manner of speaking, really.
- I never liked that little bastard.

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:03.326
- You haven't?
- Mmm-mmm.

01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:06.085
He's just no good.
You can't trust him.

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:10.640
- You never really hit it off.
- All he cares about is himself.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.924
- That's not fair.
- Bullshit fair, it's true.

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:17.844
It's really all anybody cares about
if you think about it.

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:21.050
- No wonder.
- No wonder what?

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:23.687
No wonder Chris wound up
the way he did.

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:27.971
- What the fuck did I do?
- Just shut up.

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:30.051
I mean, how stupid do you have to be

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:32.521
to let an idiot like Rex
take advantage?

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:34.409
- Rex?
- Yeah, Rex.

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:36.841
- What about Rex?
- I said...

01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:39.651
I said, how stupid do you have to be
to let an idiot like Rex

01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:41.643
- take advantage?
- Yes, I heard what you said.

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:44.724
- Tell me about Rex.
- Rex is Adele's boyfriend.

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.006
Was.

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.529
Was Adele's boyfriend.

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:50.885
Tell me about Rex.

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:53.327
- What do you want to know?
- Not you.

01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:56.084
- You.
- What?

01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:58.845
You. Tell me about Rex.

01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:01.326
What do you mean?

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:03.687
Now, you know the man, don't you?
I mean, you have met.

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:06.161
- Yeah, ofcourse.
- Tell me about him.

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.366
I don't know what you mean.

01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:10.962
Is he tall? is he fat? is he Chinese?

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.850
Where does he work, how old is he,
do his ears hang low?

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:17.447
Is he unlike other men?
Tell me about Rex.

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:24.168
Rex is..

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:31.691
I don't get this, really.

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:37.523
Who told you
about our arrangement?

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:38.726
What arrangement?

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.565
The contract between
myself and this family?

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:43.091
- Ansel.
- Why?

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:45.049
Well, she is my wife. Joe.

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:47.885
- I wasn't addressing you, sir.
- Okay.

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:52.083
- Why did he tell you?
- I'm his wife, like he said.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.324
Were you gonna get
a cut of this money?

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:55.971
- Sure.
- Why?

01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:59.206
'Cause I'm his wife, like he said.

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:02.326
Did you advise Ansel
against the idea?

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:04.366
No.

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:05.487
Why?

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:08.770
You could have told him
Chris would fuck it up.

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:11.407
It's none of my business.

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:13.323
But it is, isn't it?

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:17.449
I mean, it is your business.

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:20.730
What are you getting at?

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:22.086
If you were going to
share in the money,

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:24.686
then it is your business, isn't it?

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:26.481
Yeah, I don't know.

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:30.531
Yet you did not advise Ansel,
your husband, against it?

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:38.967
Look, I wanted some of
that money alright.

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:41.611
If... If, Chris could
pull this off, then I...

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.444
Were you gonna split Ansel's share?

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:46.524
or were the four of you
gonna split it evenly?

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:50.204
- We didn't discuss that.
- I'm sure you did.

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.682
You're a practical woman.

01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:01.326
Well, I assumed
that I would take a fourth.

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:04.488
Not one-half of one-third?

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:07.769
- No, a fourth, four ways.
- Instead of one-sixth.

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:09.571
One-sixth.

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:13.884
No. Four ways.

01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:15.962
So the remainder of the money

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:19.203
would be split evenly
after I'd been paid my fee.

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:21.808
- $25,000.
- Right, right. Right.

01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:25.805
- Yeah, right after you were covered.
- Which means equal shares.

01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:29.563
What would those four equal
shares come out to?

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:34.241
- I haven't done the math.
- Well then do it with me. Right now.

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:50.121
The insurance policy gets covered.

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.851
The agent Filpatrick
cuts Ansel a cheque.

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:55.651
Dottie, That would be Dottie.

01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:58.366
Right, best of all
possible worlds, Dottie.

01:17:58.440 --> 01:17:59.885
Look, I don't know
why we're doing all this.

01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:01.371
We're not gonna see
any of that money.

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:02.885
Just watch my feet here, alright?

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:04.200
Alright. Mhmm.

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:06.806
- So Ansel gets the cheque.
- Dottie.

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:09.247
- Dottie.
- Look, if the cheque is for 100,

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.049
We Pay you 25.

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:12.645
- How much?
- 25.

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:16.204
How much, though, the policy is for?

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:18.681
However much. How much?

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.882
- 50 thousand.
- That much.

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:24.646
- 50 minus your 25.
- Right, minus my 25,

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:26.285
but you said 100, didn't you?

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:27.885
Yeah, however much,
minus your money.

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:29.007
No, but you said 100.

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:30.525
- Yeah, however much.
- The cheque is for 100.

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:32.847
- However much.
- But you said 100.

01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:35.844
However much,
minus your 25.

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:39.771
She was mistaken, Joe.
It's 50.

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:42.725
Alright?

01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:44.286
Is it?

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:47.806
Yeah.

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:52.088
Stick around for witches
as Christopher Lee

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:55.164
unearths a whole coven
at the Horror Hotel.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.608
Join us for more of our George Raft
marathon. Starting with Whistle Stop.

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:07.168
Fuck! Come on!

01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:11.361
Isn't it?

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:16.567
No.

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:19.650
Wait a minute!

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:22.803
In case of accidental death,
the figures double.

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:26.410
Right, Filpatrick told us that
this morning, didn't he Ansel?

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:32.807
- Nah ah.
- Yeah, I think he did.

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.201
Ansel?

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:37.441
Did he?

01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:43.001
- No.
- I think he did.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.081
So...

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:51.884
- It's not 50?
- No.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.331
It's 100.

01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:00.763
- Like I say, however much.
- However much.

01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:03.242
- Look, what are you getting at?
- What do you mean?

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:06.131
- I made a mistake alright?
- Yes, you did.

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:09.409
- I said 50 or 100. However much.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:12.324
Y'all gonna do this now?

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:14.880
You said that you
never cared for Chris.

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:16.371
I haven't, I don't.

01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:20.564
And you also said
that Rex is an idiot.

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:21.971
Yeah, right.

01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:25.050
And you also said that the cheque
was for 100.

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:27.490
Or however much!

01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:32.770
- I was just wondering.
- What are you getting at?

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:39.570
Oh fuck.

01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:45.085
Whose dick is that?

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:47.246
Where did you get those?

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:49.090
That's not Ansel's dick.

01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:55.964
Is that your dick, Ansel?

01:20:57.240 --> 01:20:58.241
No.

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:03.088
Yes, it is, darling. You were drunk.

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:05.604
How about that one?

01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:07.366
Nope.

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:11.440
That one?

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:14.651
Make sure now,
you might have been drunk.

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:18.691
- No.
- Hmm.

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:23.007
Whose dick is it?

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:24.570
You just stop that.

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:27.964
- That must be your boyfriend.
- Oh, please.

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:30.527
- Your boyfriend Rex.
- Oh, please now.

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:33.803
That idiot.
The one who's getting all that money.

01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:35.809
- I didn't know!
- All 100 grand.

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:39.003
Just stop it! I didn't know
anything about this, I swear.

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:40.770
Were you aware of this, Ansel?

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:44.491
- I'm never aware.
- Of course not.

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:51.251
Whose is it?

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:54.123
You son of a bitch!

01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:57.642
There's no need for name calling.
I haven't called you any names.

01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:00.326
I am a guest here, You be polite.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.081
Now.

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:05.729
Whose little dick is that,
and do not lie to me.

01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:08.724
You lie to me, and it will be
the last lie you ever tell.

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:12.522
- Rex. - Rex?
- It's Rex - Who?

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:14.090
- Rex!
- Correct.

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:16.170
Ansel, please!

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:19.289
Ansel is not too inclined
to assist you at this point in time.

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:20.925
Are you Ansel?

01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:22.685
No, I'm not.

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:25.764
In fact, Ansel's doing just fine
standing over there.

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:27.760
Yes sir.

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:29.769
That's what I thought.

01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:33.487
- Let me go, you motherfucker!
- What did I say about insulting me?

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:43.366
We'll give you the money,
I swear it.

01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:45.369
We'll give you as much money
as you want!

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:47.522
I'm afraid that's impossible.

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:49.640
No. ifs not.

01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:52.644
Rex picked up the settlement
this afternoon.

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:53.961
What?

01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:56.566
He gave it to me before he left.

01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.250
100 grand.

01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:02.524
God Almighty.

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:03.806
Where did he go?

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:07.402
Worthless, of course.
It's made out to Rex.

01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:10.767
Where did he
say he was going?

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:14.248
- He was unavailable for comment.
- I don't understand.

01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:16.250
Why didn't you get him to...

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:19.691
I can...

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:20.921
I can get him.

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.208
Looks like you need a new boyfriend.

01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:34.250
I'll be your boyfriend,
just for a little while.

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:42.765
Just stay down.

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:45.411
Stay down.

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:54.006
Look at me.

01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:57.171
Suck this.

01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:02.564
Go fuck yourself!

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:08.121
If you insult me again,

01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:11.283
I will cut your face off
and wear it over my own.

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:13.090
Do you understand?

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:15.726
Ansel!

01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:18.165
You made your bed.

01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:19.725
That's right.

01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:21.890
Now lie in it.

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:25.731
Now suck it!

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:29.526
Please.

01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:33.326
Do you want me
to wear your face?

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:36.001
Now suck it.

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:50.201
Easy.

01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:54.524
Easy.

01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.166
Oh yeah.

01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:01.561
Oh yeah, Here we go.

01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:05.611
Alright.

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:08.247
Hey.

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:11.080
Hey!

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:13.326
What do you think?

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.291
I don't!

01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:23.561
Now listen carefully, both of you.

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:27.204
I performed a service
for this family.

01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:30.728
And I deserve my payment in full.

01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:35.882
Because of a misunderstanding
with the insurance,

01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:39.764
I won't receive any cash
for my services.

01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:44.565
That is unfair.

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:50.691
I don't care to hear excuses
or placement of the blame.

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:55.041
I hold you all equally responsible.

01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:58.730
Reach around and grab my ass.

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:01.560
Reach around and grab my ass.

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:05.961
There you go. Grab it, That's it.

01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:13.720
I was fortunate,
however, in thinking ahead.

01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:18.371
I secured a retainer for my services.

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:21.521
Since I fulfilled my obligation,

01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:25.004
and since my cash
is not forthcoming,

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:28.250
that retainer is now mine.

01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:31.446
It belongs to me.

01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:35.960
and I'm taking it with me
when I leave.

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:41.284
You're very good at this.
Please moan.

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:51.330
Chris doesn't agree
with the concept of the retainer.

01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:56.808
He's coming here tonight to
attempt to take it with him.

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:00.801
I can't,

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:05.041
allow him to do that.

01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:12.961
This family can't allow him

01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:17.290
to do that!

01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:21.565
We have to go.

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:24.889
It's suffocating me.

01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:28.283
I can't be around them any more.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.843
Do you understand me?

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:41.368
I'll slaughter all of you!

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:45.565
If this family allows Chris
to leave this trailer,

01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:47.768
I'll slaughter all of you like pigs!

01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:51.088
Do you believe I'd do that?

01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:54.204
I am asking for your help.

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:58.125
Will you give it to me?

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:01.481
Ansel?

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:04.086
Yes, sir.

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:12.887
Now, you're a very beautiful woman.

01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:17.928
Don't you think so, Ansel?

01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:21.489
I hadn't given it much thought.

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:24.126
- No! -
- Wrong answer!

01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:28.087
She's a very beautiful woman.

01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.724
And that's sweet.

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:34.805
Don't you think so?

01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:41.561
Easy.

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:43.686
Now, hey.

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:48.606
- I want you to tidy up the kitchen.
- Okay.

01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:52.921
And you're gonna set the table
for a proper meal.

01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:55.001
Okay?

01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:56.566
Get that chair.

01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:00.089
And we're all gonna sit down.

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:04.324
- for dinner.
- Okay.

01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:06.369
Just the four of us.

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:08.442
Understand? Look at me.

01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:11.565
Just the family.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.604
Get that chair.

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:40.084
How you doing, guy?

01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:46.966
- Where'd you get them pictures?
- Oh, that's hardly important.

01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:50.811
I guess.

01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:55.889
I mean, all she did was suck his cock
and try and steal your money.

01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:57.803
It could have been worse.

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:01.726
How?

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.240
Well...

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:11.964
No, I suppose that's
about as bad as it gets.

01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:17.565
Listen.

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:21.926
Go spend some time with your wife.

01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:32.886
Sharla.

01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:35.521
Yes?

01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:37.765
Are you okay?

01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:41.884
Yes, I'm fine, Ansel.

01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:45.725
Are you sure?

01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:49.890
Yes, I'm sure.

01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:57.606
Okay.

01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:04.844
Shut up, T-Bone!

01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:12.009
Hey, son.

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:14.926
- Dottie here?
- She's in the bedroom.

01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:18.887
Oh thank God, I'm starving.
You hear from Joe?

01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:20.924
He's in his bedroom.

01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:24.045
You eat already?

01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:29.605
Hi Chris.

01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:31.886
Junior.

01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:35.405
You're home.

01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:38.926
Hi, Joe.

01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:42.404
I ehh, heard about the money.

01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:45.729
I gotta tell you, I'm all broke up
things didn't work out.

01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:50.088
- Yeah me, too.
- It's the way the world turns, right?

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:51.446
Huh?

01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:53.807
It's the way the cookie crumbles?

01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:55.006
Yeah, okay.

01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:57.731
Caveat emptor, you know what I mean?

01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:01.325
Shall we dine?

01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:03.286
Dear.

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:08.289
Smells heavenly. Chris, Ansel,
you hungry for some K-Fry-C?

01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:13.211
- I'm not really that hungry.
- Well, you should join us Ansel.

01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:14.645
All of us.

01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:17.202
Chris, have a seat right here.

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:19.806
There we go. As it should be.

01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:21.446
There we are.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.321
Sharla, have a seat.

01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:32.281
Thank you.

01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:38.050
This is lovely.

01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:43.768
Who would like to say grace?

01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:48.566
Dottie.
Would you do the honours?

01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:50.165
Mmm-hmm.

01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:58.009
Dear Jesus, thank you for the food.

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:01.564
Thank you that we're all here
together and safe.

01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:03.724
We're sorry Momma's dead.

01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:07.003
We hope you'll give her a place
to stay in heaven.

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:09.686
Please forgive us
for anything we did wrong.

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:13.048
We would all like a place
to stay in heaven, too.

01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:17.768
In the Lord's name, which is
Jesus Christ, we say, "Amen."

01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:19.161
Amen.

01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:23.485
That was beautiful.

01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:25.807
Thank you.

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:28.771
Let's eat.
Sharla, would you grab us some drinks

01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:31.008
and get young Chris a plate please?

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:35.203
- White and dark?
- Yes please.

01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:37.487
Ansel, get that potato salad started
will you?

01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:38.886
And potato salad.

01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:40.849
- I love potato salad.
- And potato salad.

01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:44.962
Iced tea.
Is that homemade Sharla?

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:47.441
- Yes, it is.
- I only need one scoop of that.

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:49.568
Will you get Dottie some potato salad
on there, please?

01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:52.484
How about that you start with that
and we'll get you some more

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:54.562
if you like.
- That's perfect. Can I start now?

01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:57.530
- Yes, you may. Sharla, white or dark?
- It doesn't matter.

01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:00.047
Do you want some potato salad?

01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:02.805
Yes, please.

01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:05.406
- Sharla, potato salad?
- No, thanks.

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:09.330
- Sharla, your mascara's running.
- Fuck you.

01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:12.571
Everybody.

01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:15.568
I have an announcement to make.

01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:17.369
You've all probably noticed that

01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:20.649
Dottie and I have been spending
an awful lot of time together.

01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:24.604
The fact is, we've fallen in love.

01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:31.129
So it's my privilege to tell you that
I've asked her to be my bride.

01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:34.603
And she has accepted.

01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:37.771
- Haven't you, dear?
- Yes.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.765
- Well i for one would like to say...
- Shut up.

01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:44.761
A toast.

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:47.609
To my future wife.

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:58.091
When's all this
supposed to take place?

01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:01.688
Well, we're leaving
right after this delicious meal.

01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:04.205
Is that right?

01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:06.161
Yes.

01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:11.161
You can't have my sister Joe.

01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:13.610
What do you mean, Chris?

01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:16.047
I mean, I can't let it happen.

01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:18.162
You're not gonna marry my sister.

01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:21.085
- I don't think ifs up to you.
- Shut up.

01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:23.640
- Don't tell me to shut up.
- You say another word, old man,

01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:25.961
and I will rip your head
off your shoulders.

01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:27.405
Now, Chris,

01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:30.802
I can certainly understand
your love for your sister.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.241
But you got to cut the
old apron strings sometimes.

01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:36.642
Okay, I'm not going to discuss it.
She's my sister.

01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:39.608
I'm taking her with me.
We're leaving here.

01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:41.091
We should let Dottie decide.

01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:42.730
Dottie doesn't have
a say tn the matter.

01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:45.241
- Oh, I believe she does.
- You believe wrong.

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:47.402
Dottie' go get your stuff.

01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:50.044
Dottie, stay seated.

01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:52.080
Dottie.

01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:55.402
Stay seated.
Dottie.

01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:58.084
Dottie, sit down.

01:35:58.160 --> 01:35:59.321
Dottie.

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:02.561
Dottie. go get your stuff now.

01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:04.210
- Dottie.

01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:06.166
Dottie.

01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:08.045
Ada girl.

01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:09.887

She's my retainer.

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:16.683
Deal's off.
You're gonna have to eat this one.

01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:20.404
- You know I'll kill you.
- Go fuck yourself.

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:25.524
Take your seat Joe.

01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:29.850
- Dottie, go get your stuff!
- Dottie, stay where you are.

01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:32.890
- This will be just fine.
- Dottie! Go get your stuff!

01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:39.886
Stop it!

01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:43.561

01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:10.971
I'm getting angry!

01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:18.526
Dottie.

01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:24.202
Jesus! Dottie!

01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:25.281
Dottie!

01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:28.401
Dottie!

01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:31.761
- Easy.
- Don't, Dottie, Dottie!

01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:35.250
Put the gun down.

01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:37.410
I'm going to have a baby.

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:41.281
A baby?

01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:45.521
- A baby?
