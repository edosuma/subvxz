00:02.393 --> 00:03.307
Previously on
"The Mentalist."

00:03.394 --> 00:04.700
Agent Lisbon, Tommy Volker.

00:04.787 --> 00:06.441
I've got somebody here
who says Cassie Flood

00:06.528 --> 00:07.964
was murdered
by Tommy Volker.

00:08.051 --> 00:09.879
Show Volker this sketch
and watch his face.

00:09.966 --> 00:11.446
Do you recognize
this man?

00:11.533 --> 00:13.056
Agent, I know you're under
a lot of pressure right now.

00:13.143 --> 00:14.623
'So I don't want you to worry'

00:14.710 --> 00:16.103
that you've offended
me in any way.

00:16.190 --> 00:17.756
You don't know
what he's like.

00:17.843 --> 00:20.803
Amanda, I promise nothing
is gonna happen to you

00:20.890 --> 00:22.544
as long as you
do the right thing.

00:22.631 --> 00:24.415
[grunting]

00:24.502 --> 00:25.808
[gasping]

00:27.679 --> 00:29.551
[Tommy]
'She left a suicide note,
you know..'

00:29.638 --> 00:32.945
...laying blame
at your feet.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.644
You will not get away
with this. I promise.

00:40.736 --> 00:42.520
What did you want
to see me about?

00:42.607 --> 00:45.393
A warrant for Thomas Volker's
personal and business records.

00:45.480 --> 00:47.047
I've already
ruled on that.

00:47.134 --> 00:48.961
But we've got fresh evidence.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.876
We believe that
Thomas Volker was involved

00:50.963 --> 00:53.444
in killing this
reporter, Cassie Flood.

00:53.531 --> 00:55.707
She was investigating
Volker industries' involvement

00:55.794 --> 00:57.666
in the massacre
of a South American village.

00:57.753 --> 00:59.842
Right, I remember.

00:59.929 --> 01:02.584
I convinced his assistant,
Amanda Shaw

01:02.671 --> 01:04.934
'to testify against him,
and he killed her for it.'

01:05.021 --> 01:06.501
Made it look like a suicide.

01:06.588 --> 01:08.894
Okay, saying it
does not make it so.

01:08.981 --> 01:11.767
Yes, but I ordered
a second autopsy

01:11.854 --> 01:15.945
by a forensic pathologist
who specializes in suicide.

01:16.032 --> 01:18.078
The ligature marks
on Amanda's neck

01:18.165 --> 01:21.124
are not consistent
with suicide by hanging.

01:21.211 --> 01:22.125
She was murdered.

01:23.953 --> 01:26.390
You know, I'm surprised
that you got Gail Bertram

01:26.477 --> 01:29.785
to cough up for a second
opinion on a closed case.

01:29.872 --> 01:31.613
He didn't.
I paid for it myself.

01:34.398 --> 01:38.141
Agent Lisbon,
why are you doing this?

01:38.228 --> 01:39.490
He's a murderer.

01:39.577 --> 01:41.710
If we follow the money
we'll find who he paid

01:41.797 --> 01:43.407
to kill these women.

01:43.494 --> 01:45.714
Why are youdoing this?

01:47.237 --> 01:48.934
I looked Amanda Shaw
in the eye

01:49.021 --> 01:51.937
and I promised
I'd protect her.

01:52.024 --> 01:53.200
I failed.

01:54.897 --> 01:56.246
I know that you've
heard this before

01:56.333 --> 01:59.815
but you're not
responsible for her death.

01:59.902 --> 02:03.166
I respectfully disagree.
I need to make this right.

02:03.253 --> 02:06.517
This report gives us
plenty for a warrant.

02:06.604 --> 02:08.258
[exhales]
Alright.

02:08.345 --> 02:10.608
You do realize that
Volker Industries

02:10.695 --> 02:12.610
is one of the biggest
employers in the state.

02:12.697 --> 02:15.309
And that Tommy Volker is a huge
supporter of the governor.

02:15.396 --> 02:18.616
Yes, and that they're
also good friends.

02:18.703 --> 02:19.965
That's why I came to you

02:20.052 --> 02:22.359
because I know
that you won't be threatened

02:22.446 --> 02:24.187
by a man's status
or connections.

02:25.884 --> 02:27.669
Well, this..

02:27.756 --> 02:30.498
...report does
change things.

02:32.891 --> 02:34.850
I'm inclined to open up
the door a crack

02:34.937 --> 02:37.548
but just a crack.

02:37.635 --> 02:39.768
Don't make me regret it,
Agent Lisbon.

02:44.164 --> 02:47.079
[instrumental music]

02:51.693 --> 02:53.434
[indistinct chattering]

02:55.305 --> 02:57.220
Lisbon, you're distracted
and you have an eager

02:57.307 --> 02:59.788
gleam in your eye.

02:59.875 --> 03:02.356
Either you have a breakthrough
in the Volker case

03:02.443 --> 03:04.532
or you're in love.
Which is it?

03:04.619 --> 03:06.534
I got Judge Davis
to sign the warrant

03:06.621 --> 03:09.450
and Van Pelt should be getting
Volker's records momentarily.

03:09.537 --> 03:11.365
I was hoping it was love.

03:11.452 --> 03:14.194
You deserve happiness,
but I'm glad for you anyway.

03:15.412 --> 03:18.241
Jane Doe.
No wallet, phone, or ID.

03:18.328 --> 03:20.156
Sanitation workers found
the body around 6:00 A.M.

03:21.462 --> 03:25.030
Designer clothes.
Sample size.

03:25.117 --> 03:28.512
She's as tall
as a giraffe...a model.

03:28.599 --> 03:30.384
Looks like a mugging
gone wrong.

03:30.471 --> 03:32.037
'ME says blunt force
trauma to the head.'

03:32.124 --> 03:33.213
'Puts time of death
around midnight'

03:33.300 --> 03:34.475
'give or take
a few hours.'

03:34.562 --> 03:36.694
Mmm. She's wearing
a very sensual perfume.

03:36.781 --> 03:38.609
Expensive,
with a top note of jasmine.

03:38.696 --> 03:39.654
Oh..

03:40.916 --> 03:43.527
And she's just
shaved her legs.

03:43.614 --> 03:45.790
I think she was going
to meet a lover.

03:45.877 --> 03:47.836
Rigsby, you're on trash duty,
whoever stole the wallet

03:47.923 --> 03:49.272
may have taken the money out
and dumped it.

03:49.359 --> 03:51.579
- See if you can find an ID.
- Copy that.

03:51.666 --> 03:53.494
Jane, let's talk to
the first responders.

03:53.581 --> 03:55.278
Oh, as fun as
that might sound

03:55.365 --> 03:57.106
I think I'd rather
play some chess.

03:57.193 --> 03:59.195
- No offense.
- Mmm.

03:59.282 --> 04:00.240
[Teresa]
'Gentlemen..'

04:01.502 --> 04:04.374
[instrumental music]

04:09.640 --> 04:12.077
Single malt whisky!

04:12.164 --> 04:15.211
- You have very good taste, uh..
- Walter.

04:15.298 --> 04:16.995
Walter.

04:17.082 --> 04:18.170
Don't mind me.

04:20.738 --> 04:23.219
Uh, no disrespect,
but your Grunfeld Defense

04:23.306 --> 04:25.308
is no match for Walter's
classic Spanish game.

04:26.788 --> 04:27.963
If you let me
play for you

04:28.050 --> 04:29.269
I might win your money back.

04:31.793 --> 04:33.838
- Thanks, man.
- Pleasure.

04:35.187 --> 04:38.234
- Good luck with that.
- Uh..

04:38.321 --> 04:39.627
[inhales sharply]

04:41.585 --> 04:42.673
Mate in seven.

04:42.760 --> 04:45.067
[laughing]

04:45.154 --> 04:47.025
A sucker born
every minute.

04:48.549 --> 04:50.768
What'd you do with
the wallet?

04:50.855 --> 04:52.422
What wallet?

04:53.989 --> 04:55.991
The one you took
from the dead girl.

04:56.078 --> 04:58.167
[scoffs]
What makes you
think that?

05:00.735 --> 05:03.259
Because you're not nearly
a good enough chess player

05:03.346 --> 05:06.306
to win enough money
to buy nice scotch like that.

05:06.393 --> 05:07.655
Oh, no?

05:09.004 --> 05:09.961
No.

05:12.007 --> 05:13.965
Checkmate...in seven.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.273
You can tell us
about the wallet now

05:17.360 --> 05:19.231
or we can find the wallet
with your prints on it

05:19.319 --> 05:20.494
and bring you down
to the CBI.

05:20.581 --> 05:22.757
- 'It's your choice.'
- Mm-hmm.

05:25.281 --> 05:28.197
[music continues]

05:32.723 --> 05:34.029
Oh, yeah.

05:34.116 --> 05:36.684
Who's got next?

05:36.771 --> 05:39.643
[theme music]

05:48.043 --> 05:48.826
[Rigsby]
'Victim's name
was Charlotte Coates.'

05:48.913 --> 05:50.611
'21, goes by Charlie.'

05:50.698 --> 05:52.308
Daughter of congressman Coates
from the 54th district.

05:52.395 --> 05:53.831
And Jane was right.
She was an up-and-coming model.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.093
What else do we know?

05:55.180 --> 05:56.834
About a month ago,
she was pulled over.

05:56.921 --> 05:58.575
Cop found an 8-ball
of cocaine on her.

05:58.662 --> 05:59.794
She was arrested
for possession.

05:59.881 --> 06:01.273
Was she charged?

06:01.361 --> 06:02.971
She pled guilty,
agreed to go to rehab.

06:03.058 --> 06:05.190
She was on day 26
of a 30-day program.

06:05.277 --> 06:07.497
- Place called, uh, Oasis Ranch.
- Inpatient.

06:07.584 --> 06:09.456
So she checked out of rehab
the night of her death?

06:09.543 --> 06:11.283
Snuck out.
Park's a drug zone.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.894
Probably went there to score.

06:12.981 --> 06:14.591
What about the wallet guy?

06:14.678 --> 06:16.767
No, he was at a homeless shelter
from 7:00 P.M. to 6:00 A.M.

06:16.854 --> 06:18.073
Couldn't have done it.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.944
SFPD's canvassing
the area for witnesses.

06:20.031 --> 06:21.598
Anything else?

06:21.685 --> 06:22.904
She didn't have a phone
because the rehab

06:22.991 --> 06:24.209
confiscated it
so now we don't know

06:24.296 --> 06:25.907
if she called anyone
before sneaking out.

06:25.994 --> 06:29.954
Before rehab, she sent a bunch
of angry texts to one number.

06:30.041 --> 06:33.567
"Screw you for betraying me.
You are a bastard."

06:33.654 --> 06:35.307
- Like that.
- And did you trace the number?

06:35.395 --> 06:38.702
Yeah, belongs
to a photographer..

06:38.789 --> 06:40.661
...called Mo Kaan.

06:40.748 --> 06:42.010
Alright, look into him.

06:42.097 --> 06:44.447
Jane and I are gonna
go talk to the parents.

06:46.667 --> 06:49.844
I want you to understand
she was a good girl.

06:49.931 --> 06:52.324
The drugs were just a phase.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.239
When did she start using?

06:54.326 --> 06:57.329
[Lisa]
'Um, a few years ago
when she started modeling.'

06:57.417 --> 07:01.551
As a child, she was always
so shy and sensitive

07:01.638 --> 07:04.902
like the volume was turned up
too high in her head.

07:04.989 --> 07:06.817
I knew modeling
was a tough business

07:06.904 --> 07:09.211
and lots of rejection.

07:09.298 --> 07:10.778
I never should have
let her do it.

07:12.301 --> 07:13.650
But you did let her do it

07:13.737 --> 07:16.174
and-and the role
of bad cop fell to you.

07:16.261 --> 07:17.915
You could say that.

07:20.091 --> 07:21.963
She put us through a lot.

07:22.050 --> 07:24.487
But you-you were about
to mention something else.

07:24.574 --> 07:25.532
What was it?

07:27.403 --> 07:29.884
Well, I guess there's no reason
we can't say it now.

07:29.971 --> 07:31.755
A month ago, she stole
a necklace from her mother.

07:31.842 --> 07:34.279
A very expensive,
ruby necklace.

07:34.366 --> 07:35.672
Don't say that, Jeffrey.

07:35.759 --> 07:37.979
I told you, Charlie
couldn't have done it.

07:38.066 --> 07:39.720
Maria was the only
person who knew

07:39.807 --> 07:41.156
where I had that
necklace hidden.

07:41.243 --> 07:43.332
Maria?

07:43.419 --> 07:44.986
Yeah. She was our maid.

07:45.073 --> 07:47.554
But we had to let her go.

07:47.641 --> 07:49.033
Our daughter loved Maria

07:49.120 --> 07:50.295
she would never have
let me fire her

07:50.382 --> 07:52.167
for something she didn't do.

07:52.254 --> 07:53.690
Uh, can you think of anyone

07:53.777 --> 07:55.649
who may have wanted
to hurt your daughter?

07:58.173 --> 08:02.394
Who knows, with the people
that she was hanging out with.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.441
If you think of anything,
give us a call.

08:07.138 --> 08:08.531
[instrumental music]

08:08.618 --> 08:10.315
[Mo]
'Stella, sweetheart'

08:10.402 --> 08:12.230
you look like
an angry stick insect.

08:12.317 --> 08:14.450
Relax.
Think of Brazil.

08:14.537 --> 08:15.843
Or wherever it is you're from.

08:15.930 --> 08:17.584
- Uruguay.
- Uruguay! Fabulous!

08:17.671 --> 08:18.933
Work it! Work it!

08:19.020 --> 08:21.326
Yeah, that's right.
That's right.

08:21.413 --> 08:23.503
You're a dirty
little Cossack.

08:23.590 --> 08:26.288
Yes, Perestroika!
That's it.

08:26.375 --> 08:30.031
Mo Kaan. I'm Agent Cho.
This is Agent Rigsby, CBI.

08:30.118 --> 08:31.162
We are in the middle
of something here.

08:31.249 --> 08:32.599
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

08:32.686 --> 08:34.165
Charlie Coates
was murdered last night.

08:35.732 --> 08:37.647
My God.

08:37.734 --> 08:39.780
Everyone take five!

08:39.867 --> 08:41.869
[crew murmuring]

08:41.956 --> 08:44.349
Uh, Charlie, uh, Charlie was
one of the good ones. Smart kid.

08:44.436 --> 08:46.700
Where were you last night?

08:46.787 --> 08:48.832
I was at dinner with a client,
and then after that

08:48.919 --> 08:51.182
I was shootin' Estella
at some dirty little hotel

08:51.269 --> 08:52.575
in Tenderloin,
The Seventh Veil.

08:52.662 --> 08:55.360
- The corner of Geary and Hyde?
- Yeah.

08:55.447 --> 08:57.145
Charlie was killed
two blocks from there.

08:57.232 --> 08:59.234
Can anyone confirm
your whereabouts?

08:59.321 --> 09:01.584
Sure. Everybody here.

09:01.671 --> 09:04.065
- What about the angry texts?
- What angry texts?

09:04.152 --> 09:05.414
The ones we found
on Charlie's phone

09:05.501 --> 09:07.111
accusing you of betrayal.

09:07.198 --> 09:10.811
Oh, those.
Nothing, really.

09:10.898 --> 09:12.421
A few weeks ago,
Charlie's agent fired her

09:12.508 --> 09:14.031
and she blamed me,
she thought I told him

09:14.118 --> 09:16.251
she was a no-show
after partying all night.

09:16.338 --> 09:18.601
- And did you tell him?
- Please.

09:18.688 --> 09:20.603
If I got every crazy,
coked-up model fired

09:20.690 --> 09:22.474
I'd have no one
to take pictures of.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.390
Speaking of coke,
empty your pockets.

09:25.477 --> 09:27.958
- What?
- Empty your pockets.

09:28.045 --> 09:29.699
Why?
This isn't Russia.

09:29.786 --> 09:31.222
You need a reason.

09:31.309 --> 09:33.398
You're acting high,
you're sniffing compulsively

09:33.485 --> 09:35.923
and you're wearing
a coke spoon.

09:36.010 --> 09:37.664
- It's hers.
- Slow down, hoss.

09:37.751 --> 09:40.318
We haven't found anything yet.

09:40.405 --> 09:42.407
[instrumental music]

09:43.974 --> 09:45.410
Honestly, I was just
holding it for her.

09:45.497 --> 09:46.498
You're under arrest.

09:47.499 --> 09:50.415
[music continues]

09:55.333 --> 09:58.554
Hello, I'm Dr. Rubin,
executive director.

09:58.641 --> 10:00.077
- Hi.
- I'm so glad you're here.

10:00.164 --> 10:02.166
We are all...in shock.

10:03.385 --> 10:05.126
So you-you're a psychiatrist?

10:05.213 --> 10:07.432
Yes.
Stanford Medical School.

10:07.519 --> 10:09.826
Excellent.
That should make things easier.

10:09.913 --> 10:12.742
It's nearly always
a psychiatrist that did it.

10:12.829 --> 10:15.658
Had a bad experience
with therapy, huh?

10:15.745 --> 10:17.399
[Teresa]
'Were you treating
Charlie personally?'

10:17.486 --> 10:20.663
No, and I have weekly sessions
with all the in-patients.

10:20.750 --> 10:23.318
I met with Charlie yesterday.

10:23.405 --> 10:25.712
But Joanna Lyle was
her primary therapist.

10:25.799 --> 10:27.191
Saw her every day.

10:27.278 --> 10:29.280
You can find her in
the clinical building.

10:29.367 --> 10:31.631
How did Charlie
manage to sneak out

10:31.718 --> 10:33.937
and get to the city unnoticed?
Did she have a car?

10:34.024 --> 10:36.461
Uh, no.
Patients aren't allowed cars.

10:36.548 --> 10:38.246
It's too much of a temptation.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.291
Uh, however,
this isn't a prison.

10:40.378 --> 10:42.554
We don't have security
cameras or electric fences.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.079
In fact, we have so many
high-profile patients

10:45.166 --> 10:46.558
'we're far more worried
about keeping paparazzi'

10:46.646 --> 10:47.951
and reporters out.

10:48.038 --> 10:50.562
And how was Charlie's
treatment going?

10:50.650 --> 10:54.001
Frankly, uh,
her spirit was willing

10:54.088 --> 10:55.567
but she didn't want
to do the work.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.179
"The work."
Who could blame her?

10:58.266 --> 11:00.485
Where were you last night?

11:00.572 --> 11:04.446
I was...here.
Working on my book.

11:04.533 --> 11:06.753
Hmm, I'm just trying
to figure out

11:06.840 --> 11:08.755
who Charlie
was sleeping with.

11:08.842 --> 11:10.408
Was it you?

11:10.495 --> 11:13.368
Absolutely not.

11:13.455 --> 11:15.283
What makes you think she was
sleeping with anybody?

11:15.370 --> 11:18.721
Because this place is like
a summer camp for drug addicts.

11:18.808 --> 11:21.898
- It fairly reeks of sex.
- Hmm.

11:21.985 --> 11:25.032
Well, we're like an early
sobriety to a whack-a-mole game.

11:25.119 --> 11:27.730
You push down one addiction,
and another one pops up.

11:27.817 --> 11:31.125
And even though we have
a strict policy about it

11:31.212 --> 11:35.956
newly sober people
tend to act out sexually.

11:36.043 --> 11:38.610
But I can't tell you
who Charlie was sleeping with.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.221
Why not?

11:40.308 --> 11:42.963
A little thing called
doctor-patient privilege.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.747
Charlie's dead.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.793
You're allowed to share
that information with us.

11:46.880 --> 11:49.709
And I'm allowed
to protect privilege.

11:50.927 --> 11:52.276
I see.

11:52.363 --> 11:53.800
You're not
protecting Charlie.

11:53.887 --> 11:56.367
You're protecting
someone else.

11:56.454 --> 11:59.022
Charlie did indeed
have a lover here.

11:59.109 --> 12:01.808
They were
a patient of yours.

12:01.895 --> 12:05.550
No need to give me a name.
I can figure it out for myself.

12:05.637 --> 12:07.161
Thank you.
You've been very helpful.

12:09.032 --> 12:11.469
We need to talk to this
therapist, this Lyle woman.

12:11.556 --> 12:12.862
I'm gonna head back
to the office.

12:12.949 --> 12:14.037
I'll have Cho come
and meet you here.

12:14.124 --> 12:15.299
Oh, I'm fine.
No need for a chaperone.

12:15.386 --> 12:16.736
[phone ringing]

12:17.954 --> 12:19.347
Hey, Van Pelt.

12:19.434 --> 12:20.391
Could you hang on a sec?

12:22.132 --> 12:23.220
Jane?

12:25.309 --> 12:27.485
- What's up?
- I think I found something big.

12:27.572 --> 12:29.749
Irregular payments
from Volker Industries

12:29.836 --> 12:31.359
to a shell corporation.

12:31.446 --> 12:34.231
Listed as consultant fees.
$25,000 each.

12:34.318 --> 12:36.233
Nice work.
Who's cashing the checks?

12:36.320 --> 12:37.974
[Grace]
'A guy named Charles Milk.'

12:38.061 --> 12:39.889
He's clean as a whistle
but his name came up

12:39.976 --> 12:42.674
in a 2007 case
just as a witness.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.808
One of his neighbors
committed suicide. A woman.

12:45.895 --> 12:48.376
Let me guess.
Hung herself like Amanda Shaw?

12:48.463 --> 12:51.118
Exactly.
And I got a picture of him.

12:51.205 --> 12:53.076
Matches the sketch of
the driver we were looking for

12:53.163 --> 12:54.469
in the Cassie Flood case.

12:54.556 --> 12:56.776
Great work, I'm headed
back to the office now.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.560
Start writing the warrant
for the Milk residence.

12:58.647 --> 13:00.083
I want to catch him
by surprise.

13:00.170 --> 13:02.477
- You got it, boss.
- And tell Cho to get over here.

13:03.957 --> 13:05.262
- Dr. Lyle?
- Yes.

13:05.349 --> 13:07.221
Patrick Jane.

13:07.308 --> 13:08.875
I'm with the CBI.

13:08.962 --> 13:11.268
Uh, please,
call me Joanna.

13:11.355 --> 13:12.835
And I'm not
actually a doctor.

13:12.922 --> 13:15.664
But you were Charlie's
drug counselor, yes?

13:15.751 --> 13:18.232
Yes.
Poor girl.

13:18.319 --> 13:19.668
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

13:19.755 --> 13:22.149
Yes, it seems
that she, uh..

13:22.236 --> 13:25.108
...she broke out
to buy some coke.

13:25.195 --> 13:28.895
Is that a.. Is that
a black mark against you?

13:28.982 --> 13:30.418
As a therapist,
I'd like to think

13:30.505 --> 13:32.115
that I can help
my patients get sober.

13:32.202 --> 13:36.076
But as a recovering
alcoholic I know

13:36.163 --> 13:39.253
I can't make someone
stop before they're ready.

13:39.340 --> 13:41.168
There but for
the grace of God.

13:41.255 --> 13:43.605
Mmm. Well, let's leave
God out of it, shall we?

13:43.692 --> 13:47.652
Uh, Charlie wasn't exactly
a model patient, was she?

13:47.739 --> 13:49.480
She had a good heart.

13:49.567 --> 13:52.701
She just made it very clear
that she didn't want to be here.

13:52.788 --> 13:54.224
She wouldn't open up to me.

13:54.311 --> 13:57.619
She, uh.. She wouldn't
participate in group.

13:57.706 --> 14:00.535
- Excuse me.
- Rough night?

14:00.622 --> 14:02.232
[yawns]
I've been, uh..

14:02.319 --> 14:04.669
I've been on call
this week working overnights

14:04.756 --> 14:07.020
and we discovered that Charlie
was missing from her room

14:07.107 --> 14:09.109
at about 2:00 A.M.

14:09.196 --> 14:12.068
And...I've been
up ever since.

14:12.155 --> 14:14.592
Running on coffee
and cigarettes, huh?

14:14.679 --> 14:16.681
Oh, coffee, yes.

14:16.768 --> 14:20.772
But I haven't
smoked in years.

14:20.860 --> 14:24.037
Oh.
Well, excuse me.

14:24.124 --> 14:26.256
Could you show me
Charlie's room?

14:26.343 --> 14:28.650
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

14:28.737 --> 14:30.043
[bell dings]

14:30.130 --> 14:31.609
What's up?

14:31.696 --> 14:33.307
Did you fill out the application
for the Milk warrant?

14:33.394 --> 14:36.484
I submitted it
to Judge Davis, but..

14:36.571 --> 14:38.660
- What?
- It's Volker. He's here.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.190
[instrumental music]

14:47.277 --> 14:49.149
Agent Lisbon.

14:49.236 --> 14:52.326
What do you want,
Mr. Volker?

14:52.413 --> 14:56.069
Brass tacks.
I like that.

14:56.156 --> 14:57.897
As I'm sure you're aware

14:57.984 --> 14:59.768
I run a very
successful business

14:59.855 --> 15:02.336
worth billions of dollars.

15:02.423 --> 15:05.426
You wanna know my secret?

15:05.513 --> 15:07.994
Transparency.

15:08.081 --> 15:09.734
Honesty.

15:09.821 --> 15:12.650
Open lines
of communication.

15:12.737 --> 15:15.915
'It's the way I do business.'

15:16.002 --> 15:17.873
What's your point?

15:17.960 --> 15:21.703
If you wanted
my financial records

15:21.790 --> 15:24.924
all you had to do
was ask for them.

15:25.011 --> 15:27.578
I got nothing to hide.

15:27.665 --> 15:29.493
You found nothing, right?

15:29.580 --> 15:32.105
Why? Is there something
you're worried about?

15:33.758 --> 15:34.934
Next time..

15:37.023 --> 15:38.720
...just ask.

15:40.852 --> 15:43.377
You look good.

15:43.464 --> 15:46.249
You've been working out.

15:46.336 --> 15:47.816
Get out of my office.

15:49.470 --> 15:51.820
Have a lovely day,
Agent Lisbon.

15:53.865 --> 15:54.954
[door opening]

16:05.051 --> 16:06.661
[indistinct chattering]

16:07.618 --> 16:10.491
[instrumental music]

16:15.409 --> 16:17.498
Hey, Cho.
You're freaking out the guests.

16:17.585 --> 16:20.805
Just relax
with the copness.

16:20.892 --> 16:22.720
I'm relaxed.

16:23.939 --> 16:26.855
[music continues]

16:29.814 --> 16:30.772
Here we are.

16:30.859 --> 16:31.903
[knock on door]

16:31.991 --> 16:33.470
Susie?

16:33.557 --> 16:35.777
Hey.
How you holding up?

16:35.864 --> 16:37.997
Okay, I guess.

16:38.084 --> 16:41.087
Shouldn't you be in group?
You should go.

16:41.174 --> 16:44.394
Talk about what happened
with Charlie, your feelings.

16:44.481 --> 16:45.874
Hi.
You were her roommate?

16:45.961 --> 16:47.441
Yeah, who are you?

16:47.528 --> 16:51.358
Uh, Susie, these guys
are here with the CBI

16:51.445 --> 16:53.621
to investigate what
happened with Charlie.

16:53.708 --> 16:56.189
That's Patrick Jane.
I'm Agent Cho.

16:56.276 --> 16:58.495
"Jane" as in Austen
or Mansfield?

16:59.888 --> 17:02.586
[chuckles]
Austen.

17:02.673 --> 17:05.459
What are you here for?

17:05.546 --> 17:08.244
- 'Coke. Speed. Some pills.'
- 'Mm-hmm.'

17:08.331 --> 17:10.377
Mmm, ambitious.

17:10.464 --> 17:12.422
So Charlie was
a tea drinker?

17:12.509 --> 17:14.163
No, those are mine.

17:14.250 --> 17:15.860
Did you see Charlie
sneaking out last night?

17:15.947 --> 17:18.167
Yes, I didn't think
anything of it.

17:18.254 --> 17:19.864
'She sneaks out
all the time.'

17:19.951 --> 17:21.692
[Joanna]
'Susie, you should
have reported it.'

17:21.779 --> 17:23.259
'It's a major breach
of the honor system.'

17:23.346 --> 17:25.392
[Susie]
'I know, I know.'

17:25.479 --> 17:27.829
I'm gonna have to tell
Dr. Rubin about it.

17:27.916 --> 17:29.787
Come on.
Are you serious?

17:29.874 --> 17:31.311
[Cho]
'What time did she sneak out?'

17:31.398 --> 17:34.357
[Susie]
'I don't know.
Around 10:00, I guess.'

17:34.444 --> 17:36.272
[Cho]
'You know where she was going?'

17:36.359 --> 17:37.882
I have no idea.
We weren't that close.

17:37.969 --> 17:41.190
Mmm, Jasmine.

17:41.277 --> 17:43.366
Uh, Dr. Lyle

17:43.453 --> 17:45.934
where is that group therapy
session going down?

17:46.021 --> 17:48.197
Uh, just down the hall.

17:48.284 --> 17:49.807
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

17:51.896 --> 17:54.290
My name is Armando
and I'm an addict.

17:54.377 --> 17:55.857
- Hi, Armando.
- Hi, Armando.

17:55.944 --> 17:58.425
But I mean, not like you guys.
No offense.

17:58.512 --> 17:59.991
My life's a party.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.081
Champagne.
Fine women.

18:03.908 --> 18:05.736
Translation, light beer
and cheap hookers.

18:05.823 --> 18:07.608
- Hey, now.
- Yo.

18:07.695 --> 18:09.436
Why the hostility, man?

18:09.523 --> 18:11.742
I'm only being
honest here, right?

18:11.829 --> 18:14.484
See this watch?
Girls gave this stuff to me.

18:14.571 --> 18:16.704
And that's my problem.

18:16.791 --> 18:19.489
I'm addicted to women.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.491
Excuse me.
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

18:21.578 --> 18:23.928
Just when it was getting good.
Uh, my name is Patrick Jane.

18:24.015 --> 18:25.582
I'm a consultant with the CBI.

18:25.669 --> 18:27.758
We're investigating
the murder of Charlie Coates.

18:27.845 --> 18:32.372
- Uh, and, uh, I need your help.
- Okay.

18:32.459 --> 18:36.419
You may not think...
you know anything of interest

18:36.506 --> 18:39.988
but the subconscious mind
knows a lot more.

18:40.075 --> 18:42.338
That's why I'm gonna ask
you all, as a group

18:42.425 --> 18:45.689
to close your eyes
and picture Charlie.

18:47.778 --> 18:51.956
Uh...I want you to think about
the last time you saw Charlie.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.179
Every detail counts.

18:57.266 --> 19:01.357
Her laugh.
The color of her eyes.

19:01.444 --> 19:04.273
Her perfume.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.493
Every little detail.

19:06.580 --> 19:09.670
Okay. Thank you.

19:09.757 --> 19:11.237
Now, if you'll open your eyes.

19:11.324 --> 19:13.152
[inhales sharply]

19:13.239 --> 19:15.328
It appears you two..

19:15.415 --> 19:18.113
'...are intimately
familiar with her scent.'

19:18.200 --> 19:20.115
But Charlie doesn't strike
me as a two-timer.

19:20.202 --> 19:21.856
So one of you was the boyfriend

19:21.943 --> 19:24.511
and the other one,
well, he was hoping.

19:24.598 --> 19:27.253
Let me see. You seem to have
a way with women.

19:27.340 --> 19:30.256
I would guess that Charlie

19:30.343 --> 19:34.129
may have been drawn
to your machismo.

19:34.216 --> 19:36.436
She found you irresistible.

19:36.523 --> 19:38.568
Maybe.
But you know.

19:38.655 --> 19:40.309
Hmm.

19:40.396 --> 19:41.745
You were sleeping together?

19:41.832 --> 19:43.617
[Armando]
'No.'

19:43.704 --> 19:45.488
Uh, you-you're lying.

19:45.575 --> 19:47.316
You were sleeping together.
I can tell.

19:47.403 --> 19:49.144
- 'No. No.'
- Yes.

19:49.231 --> 19:50.232
I mean, I tried,
of course.

19:50.319 --> 19:51.581
- But..
- You bastard!

19:51.668 --> 19:52.974
And here comes
the real boyfriend.

19:53.061 --> 19:54.105
Aah!

19:54.193 --> 19:57.674
[all screaming]

19:57.761 --> 19:59.415
Just back away there.
I-I was just kidding.

19:59.502 --> 20:00.982
He wasn't actually
sleeping with her.

20:01.069 --> 20:02.375
Just...Cho!

20:02.462 --> 20:03.463
Cho!

20:05.726 --> 20:07.510
- 'Get him off!'
- Whew!

20:13.212 --> 20:16.127
Phoenix Bell.
Your father's Anton Bell.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.739
Starred in those action movies
back in the '80s, right?

20:18.826 --> 20:22.960
And who's your father?
Is he relevant also?

20:23.047 --> 20:24.962
Point taken.

20:25.049 --> 20:28.052
Tell me about
you and Charlie.

20:28.139 --> 20:32.405
She was funny
and strong and...real.

20:32.492 --> 20:34.798
But fragile too.

20:34.885 --> 20:37.845
Not like these girls
I meet in LA.

20:37.932 --> 20:39.499
I know the doctors say
she didn't want to get better

20:39.586 --> 20:41.240
but she did.

20:41.327 --> 20:42.893
She made me want
to get better too.

20:42.980 --> 20:44.939
We talked to your
roommate, Phoenix.

20:45.026 --> 20:46.854
He says you snuck out
of your room at 11:00

20:46.941 --> 20:48.334
on the night Charlie died
and didn't come home

20:48.421 --> 20:51.162
until 1:00 in the morning.
Where were you?

20:51.250 --> 20:53.600
We had this spot where
we'd meet out in the desert.

20:53.687 --> 20:54.949
That night we were supposed
to hook up at 11:00

20:55.036 --> 20:56.820
but Charlie didn't show.

20:56.907 --> 20:58.648
What'd you do?

20:58.735 --> 21:00.650
I freaked out.

21:00.737 --> 21:02.348
I thought that
she was over me

21:02.435 --> 21:05.568
or she had relapsed
or something.

21:05.655 --> 21:06.874
So I took a drive.

21:08.658 --> 21:09.790
You have a car?

21:11.487 --> 21:12.836
My dad pulled a few strings

21:12.923 --> 21:14.838
got me some extra privileges.
Whatever.

21:14.925 --> 21:17.276
Where'd you go?

21:17.363 --> 21:19.669
Just around.

21:19.756 --> 21:21.105
And then I went
to a liquor store.

21:22.324 --> 21:24.892
[sighs]
You get loaded?

21:24.979 --> 21:27.329
No.
I wanted to.

21:28.809 --> 21:30.941
- Anyone see you there?
- No.

21:33.074 --> 21:35.250
But you have to
believe me.

21:35.337 --> 21:37.339
All the bad things
I've done in my life

21:37.426 --> 21:39.036
I would never
hurt Charlie.

21:39.123 --> 21:42.692
Right. Can you think
of anyone who would?

21:42.779 --> 21:44.390
I don't know.

21:44.477 --> 21:45.826
A few nights ago,
we were in our spot

21:45.913 --> 21:48.568
and we saw somebody
spying on us from far away.

21:48.655 --> 21:50.134
You went after them?

21:50.221 --> 21:51.788
Yeah, but I didn't
even get close.

21:55.749 --> 21:58.491
If she would have
just come that night

21:58.578 --> 22:01.537
maybe I could have
helped her.

22:01.624 --> 22:04.497
[instrumental music]

22:05.672 --> 22:07.326
Phoenix had access to a car.

22:07.413 --> 22:09.632
He has no alibi
for the time of death.

22:09.719 --> 22:12.635
And his story about someone
spying on them is sketchy.

22:12.722 --> 22:14.071
- You think he made it up?
- No.

22:14.158 --> 22:15.682
Someone was watching
Phoenix and Charlie.

22:15.769 --> 22:17.248
The question is who?

22:17.336 --> 22:19.599
Son of a movie star,
daughter of a politician.

22:19.686 --> 22:21.557
- Could have been the paparazzi.
- What about Armando?

22:21.644 --> 22:23.472
No, he had an alibi
for the night of the murder.

22:23.559 --> 22:25.387
His roommate was up all night
listening to him snore.

22:25.474 --> 22:27.258
Rigs, where are we
at with the photographer?

22:27.346 --> 22:28.477
He's been in holding
overnight.

22:28.564 --> 22:30.131
Good, go talk to him.

22:30.218 --> 22:32.699
Find out where Phoenix was
between 11:00 and 1:00.

22:32.786 --> 22:34.788
'We'll hold on to him
for as long as we can.'

22:34.875 --> 22:36.442
I have an idea.
I'm gonna go back to rehab.

22:36.529 --> 22:38.226
- You wanna come with?
- I've got a hit on Volker.

22:38.313 --> 22:39.532
I think I found
his enforcer.

22:39.619 --> 22:41.098
He's a guy named
Charles Milk.

22:41.185 --> 22:42.839
I'm waiting to get
a warrant on his residence.

22:42.926 --> 22:44.058
Bravo.

22:44.145 --> 22:45.364
There's no way
this guy is as smart

22:45.451 --> 22:46.843
or as careful as Volker.

22:46.930 --> 22:49.237
- I can turn him.
- Excellent police work, Lisbon.

22:49.324 --> 22:51.457
I admire your pluck.

22:51.544 --> 22:53.502
- I hear a "But."
- No "But."

22:53.589 --> 22:55.156
I'm just a little worried
that he's inside your head.

22:55.243 --> 22:56.940
And believe me that's not
a good road to go down.

22:57.027 --> 22:58.159
Bad neighborhood.

22:58.246 --> 23:00.553
I don't really
have a choice.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.076
Well, yeah, I can
certainly understand that.

23:02.163 --> 23:04.208
I just..

23:04.295 --> 23:06.994
I-I want you
to be careful.

23:07.081 --> 23:09.649
He may be powerful,
but he is not invincible.

23:09.736 --> 23:11.651
- And he's not in my head.
- I hope not.

23:11.738 --> 23:12.826
If you need my help,
let me know.

23:12.913 --> 23:14.349
No, thanks.
This one's mine.

23:14.436 --> 23:16.307
Yeah, you got this!

23:16.395 --> 23:17.874
Hey, boss,
I just got a call.

23:17.961 --> 23:19.833
The judge denied
the search warrant for Milk.

23:22.923 --> 23:24.577
Excuse me.
Judge Davis.

23:24.664 --> 23:26.622
- I just need a minute.
- I'm late for an appointment.

23:26.709 --> 23:28.102
I need you
to reconsider signing

23:28.189 --> 23:29.669
the Charles Milk
warrant, please.

23:29.756 --> 23:32.454
- It's not going to happen.
- Why not?

23:32.541 --> 23:33.847
We have clear evidence
of payment

23:33.934 --> 23:34.978
for the commission
of murder.

23:35.065 --> 23:36.676
Spare me the hyperbole.

23:36.763 --> 23:39.548
You have murky evidence
of payments for consulting.

23:39.635 --> 23:42.638
Frankly, we had less before
you signed the last warrant.

23:42.725 --> 23:45.293
What happened
between then and now?

23:45.380 --> 23:46.686
Did he get to you?

23:46.773 --> 23:48.731
I'm gonna pretend
I didn't just hear that.

23:50.124 --> 23:52.474
He did, didn't he?

23:52.561 --> 23:55.172
That's why he came to see me,
to show he wasn't scared.

23:55.259 --> 23:56.391
You know what,
I'm not gonna sit here

23:56.478 --> 23:57.740
and listen
to your accusations

23:57.827 --> 23:59.133
nor am I gonna get
dragged any further

23:59.220 --> 24:01.222
into your personal vendetta.

24:02.658 --> 24:04.181
Now..

24:04.268 --> 24:05.574
...if you will excuse me.

24:08.751 --> 24:11.624
[intense music]

24:15.410 --> 24:17.630
I bet you loved
to watch Charlie beg.

24:19.196 --> 24:20.546
I don't know
what you're getting at.

24:20.633 --> 24:22.417
Well, you can't seem
to stay out of trouble.

24:22.504 --> 24:24.811
Underage girls, drugs.

24:24.898 --> 24:27.204
It's not...my fault.

24:27.291 --> 24:28.641
You know what I think?

24:28.728 --> 24:29.903
I think Charlie
was gonna meet you

24:29.990 --> 24:32.558
the night she snuck
out of rehab.

24:32.645 --> 24:33.994
She wanted drugs,
you wanted sex

24:34.081 --> 24:35.343
things got a little weird.

24:35.430 --> 24:37.214
You didn't mean
to hurt her, but you did.

24:37.301 --> 24:38.520
So you took
her body to the park

24:38.607 --> 24:39.565
made it look
like a random drug deal.

24:39.652 --> 24:40.740
No!

24:40.827 --> 24:42.568
Just another model
with a coke habit.

24:42.655 --> 24:44.178
No. None of-none,
none of that happened.

24:44.265 --> 24:47.877
No.
That's not true, okay?

24:47.964 --> 24:50.184
I don't..

24:50.271 --> 24:51.881
I don't wanna
be here anymore now.

24:51.968 --> 24:54.971
I wanna go home
now, please.

24:55.058 --> 24:57.191
[cell phone ringing]

24:57.278 --> 24:58.627
Hello, Grace.
Do you have anything?

24:58.714 --> 25:00.890
I set an alert for
the name Phoenix Bell

25:00.977 --> 25:03.763
and I'm checking all
social media and gossip sites.

25:03.850 --> 25:05.242
Nothing so far.

25:05.329 --> 25:06.983
But I've learned a lot
about Lindsay Lohan.

25:07.070 --> 25:09.159
Mmm, can you try
again, please?

25:09.246 --> 25:11.422
[Grace]
'Sure, give me a minute.'

25:11.510 --> 25:13.207
Refill, please, Louis?

25:14.513 --> 25:15.775
Another rough one?

25:15.862 --> 25:18.125
Oh, these overnights
will be the death of me.

25:18.212 --> 25:19.822
- Mmm.
- But I shouldn't complain.

25:19.909 --> 25:21.258
I live halfway to Reno.

25:21.345 --> 25:23.478
So at least it's a break
from the commute, right?

25:23.565 --> 25:25.436
Mmm. Mmm.

25:25.524 --> 25:26.829
- Well, cheers.
- Cheers.

25:26.916 --> 25:28.439
Are you there, Jane?
I found something.

25:28.527 --> 25:29.658
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hmm.

25:29.745 --> 25:31.878
Uh, yes, Grace.
Sorry, go on.

25:31.965 --> 25:35.359
The gossip site "Rumor Hound"
just re-tweeted this.

25:35.446 --> 25:38.058
"Phoenix Bell,
son of movie star Anton Bell

25:38.145 --> 25:39.712
"suspect in murder
of his girlfriend.

25:39.799 --> 25:43.019
The two met at infamous
rehab "Oasis Ranch."

25:43.106 --> 25:46.936
Who was the, uh,
tweeterer-er?

25:47.023 --> 25:49.286
Someone named
Margaret Hammersby.

25:49.373 --> 25:50.505
She's a journalist.

25:50.592 --> 25:51.680
Excellent.

[knock on door]

26:02.865 --> 26:04.780
Hi, Susie.

26:04.867 --> 26:07.740
Could I bother you
for a cup of tea?

26:07.827 --> 26:09.568
Sure.
Come on in.

26:10.481 --> 26:11.570
Thank you.

26:12.962 --> 26:14.355
[door closing]

26:14.442 --> 26:16.444
Would you like
chamomile or mint?

26:16.531 --> 26:19.403
Chamomile, please.

26:19.490 --> 26:21.231
Water's hot.
There you go.

26:21.318 --> 26:23.103
That's very kind.

26:23.190 --> 26:24.278
Thanks, Margaret.

26:24.365 --> 26:25.845
You're welcome.

26:29.979 --> 26:31.198
Oh, fudge.

26:34.810 --> 26:36.377
Your real name
is Margaret Hammersby.

26:36.464 --> 26:37.552
You're a journalist.

26:37.639 --> 26:38.988
How did you find out?

26:39.075 --> 26:40.468
Well, only a journalist
would ask

26:40.555 --> 26:42.383
the correct spelling
of my name.

26:42.470 --> 26:44.777
'"Mansfield" please.'

26:44.864 --> 26:48.171
And what self-respecting,
speed freak drinks herbal tea?

26:48.258 --> 26:50.260
I have to be undercover
in order to get this story.

26:50.347 --> 26:53.960
Mmm, Woodward and Bernstein
you are not, my dear.

26:54.047 --> 26:56.615
You're tweeting trivia
about celebrities.

26:56.702 --> 26:59.574
Sons of celebrities..

26:59.661 --> 27:01.750
...like Phoenix Bell.

27:01.837 --> 27:03.970
That's a big scoop.
I had to tweet it.

27:04.057 --> 27:06.363
That was you spying
on them the other night.

27:06.450 --> 27:08.496
I only followed them out
that one time.

27:08.583 --> 27:09.845
I swear, I have no idea
where she was going

27:09.932 --> 27:11.412
the night she died.

27:11.499 --> 27:15.068
She didn't really open up to me.
Not really.

27:15.155 --> 27:16.504
She got emotional

27:16.591 --> 27:18.201
when she got this card
from her parents.

27:18.288 --> 27:20.334
Oh, this card?

27:21.509 --> 27:23.424
Yeah, she cried like a baby.

27:23.511 --> 27:26.862
"We're so proud of you."

27:26.949 --> 27:29.038
When did she get this?

27:29.125 --> 27:32.563
Three days ago.
The day before she died.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.043
After she got the card

27:34.130 --> 27:35.784
she started writing
this letter in Spanish

27:35.871 --> 27:38.657
but then she got frustrated
and ripped it up.

27:38.744 --> 27:42.182
And then you promptly dug it
out of the trash, didn't you?

27:42.269 --> 27:43.270
Yes, I did.

27:43.357 --> 27:44.880
But I don't speak Spanish.

27:44.967 --> 27:46.882
The only thing I can remember
is "Lo siento."

27:46.969 --> 27:49.189
That means "I'm sorry."

27:49.276 --> 27:51.887
Excellent.
You've been very helpful.

27:51.974 --> 27:53.541
You're not gonna blow
my cover, are you?

27:53.628 --> 27:55.935
Well, that's for me to know
and for you to find out.

27:59.112 --> 28:00.417
You know, you don't
have to stick around.

28:00.504 --> 28:02.463
I can meet you back at CBI.

28:02.550 --> 28:04.073
I'm supposed
to stay with you.

28:04.160 --> 28:06.510
What kind of trouble
am I gonna get in at rehab?

29:04.873 --> 29:06.701
The photographer
asked for a lawyer.

29:06.788 --> 29:08.050
I think he might
be good for this.

29:08.137 --> 29:10.139
He's more than just
ironically pervy.

29:10.226 --> 29:11.750
Agreed.

29:11.837 --> 29:13.577
And the sexual motive
is always a good one.

29:13.664 --> 29:16.929
But, uh, you can let him go.
Phoenix, too.

29:17.016 --> 29:18.974
- You have better motive?
- Uh, yeah.

29:19.061 --> 29:21.411
An extremely valuable
ruby necklace

29:21.498 --> 29:23.326
is a pretty good one.

29:23.413 --> 29:24.545
But we don't have
any evidence

29:24.632 --> 29:26.242
that Charlie actually stole

29:26.329 --> 29:27.809
the necklace from her mother.

29:27.896 --> 29:29.898
She was broke.
Of course she stole it.

29:29.985 --> 29:31.421
Then she got that card
from her parents

29:31.508 --> 29:32.988
and she started
to feel bad about it.

29:33.075 --> 29:35.077
Where are you
getting all this?

29:35.164 --> 29:36.775
The undercover journalist
told me that Charlie started

29:36.862 --> 29:39.516
writing a letter in Spanish
to say "Lo siento."

29:39.603 --> 29:41.605
- Which means "I'm sorry?"
- Yes.

29:41.692 --> 29:43.259
She was trying to make
amends with Maria

29:43.346 --> 29:45.044
the maid that was fired
for stealing the necklace.

29:45.131 --> 29:47.350
But we never found the necklace
in Charlie's apartment

29:47.437 --> 29:49.613
or her room
at the Oasis Ranch.

29:49.700 --> 29:54.096
Because the killer
stole it from her.

29:54.183 --> 29:56.969
Okay, wait, if Charlie
did steal the necklace

29:57.056 --> 29:58.361
and felt guilty about it
don't you think

29:58.448 --> 29:59.841
she would have
confided in someone?

29:59.928 --> 30:02.148
Yes, that's exactly
what I think.

30:02.235 --> 30:04.193
Hello?

30:04.280 --> 30:06.413
Dr. Rubin.

30:06.500 --> 30:07.718
What's that?

30:09.677 --> 30:11.505
Uh, well, thank you
for letting us know.

30:11.592 --> 30:13.899
We'll be there shortly.

30:13.986 --> 30:16.553
Apparently there was a rash
of robberies earlier today.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.729
A lot of the patients
got their valuables stolen.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.340
[gasps]
Imagine that.

30:20.427 --> 30:22.037
They're gonna search
the rooms to find the thief.

30:22.124 --> 30:24.300
Oh, my. We should
head out there, Lisbon.

30:24.387 --> 30:26.694
I'm sorry. I can't.
I-I'll meet you there later.

30:29.044 --> 30:31.307
So mysterious.

30:31.394 --> 30:32.656
Let me see,
Thursday night.

30:32.743 --> 30:35.181
Ah, you're going
to play poker.

30:35.268 --> 30:37.531
Get one of those muckety-mucks
to sign off on your warrant.

30:37.618 --> 30:39.272
It's worth a shot.

30:39.359 --> 30:41.491
If this doesn't work,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

30:41.578 --> 30:43.232
Eh, we'll think of something.
Good luck.

30:44.190 --> 30:46.975
[instrumental music]

30:47.062 --> 30:50.544
Let's see what
you got, senator.

30:50.631 --> 30:53.764
- Full house.
- Mmm.

30:53.852 --> 30:56.898
You've bled me dry.

30:56.985 --> 30:57.986
'I need a drink.'

31:00.902 --> 31:01.990
[indistinct chattering]

31:03.992 --> 31:06.516
Judge Manchester,
excuse me, sir.

31:06.603 --> 31:07.996
I need to discuss
something with you.

31:08.083 --> 31:09.998
I'm in no mood,
Agent Lisbon.

31:10.085 --> 31:12.044
I don't want to bother you,
I hate to.

31:12.131 --> 31:13.349
But this is important.

31:13.436 --> 31:14.960
Let me guess..

31:15.047 --> 31:17.179
...Tommy Volker
and the Charles Milk warrant.

31:17.266 --> 31:19.355
You heard.

31:19.442 --> 31:22.837
Judge Davis mentioned something
about your little visit.

31:22.924 --> 31:25.057
She said you had some nerve.

31:25.144 --> 31:28.582
I was upset.
I spoke in haste.

31:28.669 --> 31:30.453
No need
to apologize to me.

31:30.540 --> 31:32.673
Oh, I don't want to apologize.
Davis was wrong.

31:32.760 --> 31:36.198
I mean, Volker is a sociopath,
and he needs to be taken down.

31:36.285 --> 31:38.505
If not by me,
then by somebody else.

31:38.592 --> 31:41.595
Sometimes you are
childishly naive, Teresa.

31:41.682 --> 31:44.859
That might be so, but which side
would you rather be on?

31:44.946 --> 31:47.383
Childish naiveté,
or defeated cynicism?

31:47.470 --> 31:49.168
Ouch.

31:49.255 --> 31:52.084
Please, sign
the Milk warrant, judge.

31:52.171 --> 31:53.868
It's legit.

31:53.955 --> 31:55.914
The only reason
not to is fear.

32:00.309 --> 32:02.572
Doctor, we're here
to help you search.

32:02.659 --> 32:03.791
Do you think
the robberies could have

32:03.878 --> 32:05.488
something to do
with this case?

32:05.575 --> 32:07.751
Maybe. We won't know until
we search the room first.

32:07.838 --> 32:10.015
Well, this isn't the first time
we've had things stolen.

32:10.102 --> 32:11.320
It's quite common, in fact.

32:11.407 --> 32:12.365
It's another way
for addicts to

32:12.452 --> 32:13.932
'act out in early sobriety.'

32:14.019 --> 32:15.629
You and your fancy diagnoses.

32:15.716 --> 32:17.457
When people want stuff,
they take it.

32:17.544 --> 32:18.849
It's as simple as that.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.242
Now let's get to searching,
shall we?

32:20.329 --> 32:22.070
'This place isn't
gonna search itself.'

32:24.029 --> 32:25.204
'Mmm.'

32:32.689 --> 32:34.822
- What are you doing?
- What?

32:34.909 --> 32:36.824
Put it back.

32:36.911 --> 32:39.174
- Sshh.
- Put it back!

32:39.261 --> 32:41.307
[Jane]
'What are you talking about?'

32:41.394 --> 32:42.830
'I'm trying to search here.
Could you be a little quiet?'

32:42.917 --> 32:45.224
Excuse me. Excuse me.
What's going on?

32:45.311 --> 32:48.705
I'm sorry, doctor,
Jane's had some problems, uh..

32:48.792 --> 32:50.403
...taking stuff.

32:50.490 --> 32:53.058
Oh, well, that's the first
I've ever heard of that.

32:53.145 --> 32:54.581
Well, in that case,
let's empty your pocket.

32:54.668 --> 32:56.017
No, I will not.

32:56.104 --> 32:57.236
Don't make this
any worse than it is.

32:57.323 --> 32:58.628
Empty your pockets right now!

33:02.719 --> 33:04.069
Wow, that's..

33:06.854 --> 33:08.551
I can't believe I couldn't
feel that in there.

33:11.946 --> 33:14.601
That's not mine. I didn't..
That's-that's not my wallet.

33:14.688 --> 33:17.343
I think we should reconvene
in my office for a little chat.

33:17.430 --> 33:19.171
Keith, Marvin, would you
escort Mr. Jane to the office?

33:19.258 --> 33:20.650
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
watch the suit.

33:23.566 --> 33:25.829
I got here as soon
as I could.

33:25.916 --> 33:28.528
Kleptomania is a disease,
and you need help.

33:28.615 --> 33:30.051
Oh, please.

33:30.138 --> 33:32.184
I've told him that,
but he won't listen.

33:32.271 --> 33:33.750
It's not your fault.

33:33.837 --> 33:36.014
There is nothing
to be ashamed of.

33:36.101 --> 33:38.190
Yeah, see the last thing
I need is some new age nonsense

33:38.277 --> 33:39.887
rattling around inside my head.

33:39.974 --> 33:41.628
[Lisbon]
'Jane, I don't
think you understand'

33:41.715 --> 33:43.108
how much trouble you're in.

33:43.195 --> 33:44.326
- They could press charges.
- No, hang on.

33:44.413 --> 33:45.458
We're not there yet.
We're not there yet.

33:45.545 --> 33:46.763
I wanna hear from Mr. Jane.

33:46.850 --> 33:48.678
You're not even
a real doctor.

33:48.765 --> 33:50.854
I don't have to
talk to you.

33:50.941 --> 33:53.031
Jane..

33:53.118 --> 33:54.293
...it couldn't hurt.

33:54.945 --> 33:56.034
Please?

33:57.165 --> 33:58.166
Okay.

33:59.907 --> 34:03.650
I like to take stuff,
and I'm good at it.

34:03.737 --> 34:06.044
I don't see
what the big deal is.

34:06.131 --> 34:09.134
Well, this behavior
doesn't come from nowhere.

34:09.221 --> 34:10.787
No, you're right.

34:10.874 --> 34:13.573
When I was 10, my father
taught me to pick pockets

34:13.660 --> 34:15.444
and we knocked off
a few houses.

34:15.531 --> 34:19.274
And then we...moved on
to a couple of banks.

34:19.361 --> 34:21.885
But I didn't..
The banks was not my cup of tea.

34:21.972 --> 34:24.758
I don't like the banks 'cause
of the anxiety and the screaming

34:24.845 --> 34:26.107
and all the hysteria.

34:26.194 --> 34:29.328
- It doesn't sit well with me.
- Hmm.

34:29.415 --> 34:31.982
So subconsciously..

34:32.070 --> 34:35.160
...you're still trying
to please your father, hmm?

34:35.247 --> 34:38.119
[instrumental music]

34:41.035 --> 34:42.341
Yeah.

34:44.865 --> 34:46.823
Yeah.
That's, uh..

34:50.740 --> 34:52.786
How do you do that?
That is uncanny.

34:52.873 --> 34:54.918
Jane..

34:55.005 --> 34:56.094
[cell phone ringing]

34:56.181 --> 34:58.008
Mmm.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.272
Hello, Cho?

35:00.359 --> 35:03.057
[sighs]
A ruby necklace?

35:04.058 --> 35:07.540
'Really? Thanks.'

35:07.627 --> 35:10.673
They just found an expensive
ruby necklace in your car.

35:10.760 --> 35:14.112
You wanna explain
how it got there?

35:14.199 --> 35:15.722
- Not really.
- 'Thank you.'

35:15.809 --> 35:17.419
But this is a police matter now

35:17.506 --> 35:19.987
if you two wouldn't mind giving
me a moment alone with Jane.

35:20.074 --> 35:21.554
Yes, of course.
We'll leave you alone.

35:23.947 --> 35:26.167
You definitely should
continue therapy.

35:26.254 --> 35:28.387
Mmm.
I-I can make a referral.

35:29.736 --> 35:31.390
Thanks, doc.

35:31.477 --> 35:34.175
I mean, I-I..
I feel better already.

35:36.177 --> 35:37.831
[music continues]

35:41.922 --> 35:44.142
[instrumental music]

36:01.159 --> 36:04.074
[music continues]

36:05.685 --> 36:06.686
[switch clicks]

36:07.774 --> 36:08.992
Busted.

36:09.079 --> 36:10.124
[sighs]

36:12.561 --> 36:14.172
You're in massive debt.

36:14.259 --> 36:17.044
Cash advances,
credit cards

36:17.131 --> 36:19.089
home equity loans.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.614
What is it?
Craps, roulette?

36:23.137 --> 36:25.487
Those are for suckers.

36:25.574 --> 36:28.186
- I have skill.
- Blackjack then.

36:30.579 --> 36:32.102
How did you know?

36:32.190 --> 36:33.930
You told Jane you didn't smoke
and yet the inside

36:34.017 --> 36:36.194
of your office smelled
like a casino ashtray.

36:36.281 --> 36:38.370
And you referred to home
as being "Halfway to Reno."

36:40.023 --> 36:43.766
It started...years ago

36:43.853 --> 36:46.987
after I stopped drinking.

36:47.074 --> 36:50.643
Good, clean fun, right?

36:50.730 --> 36:53.211
But it got out of control.

36:53.298 --> 36:56.126
I lost my house.

36:58.085 --> 37:00.218
Burned through
my kid's college fund

37:00.305 --> 37:02.829
and I still couldn't stop.

37:02.916 --> 37:05.832
How did you pay for it?

37:05.919 --> 37:08.487
I started borrowing
money from people.

37:08.574 --> 37:10.706
Bad people.

37:10.793 --> 37:13.361
They were going to hurt me.

37:13.448 --> 37:16.625
So you heard about the necklace
and you saw a way out.

37:16.712 --> 37:21.021
Charlie had this-this...
moment of clarity

37:21.108 --> 37:22.631
after she got
that stupid card.

37:22.718 --> 37:25.460
She, uh...
came into therapy

37:25.547 --> 37:29.290
told me she had
stolen the necklace.

37:29.377 --> 37:30.857
She had tried to sell it
but she didn't have

37:30.944 --> 37:33.773
the right connections.

37:33.860 --> 37:36.384
And then she wanted to
give it back to her parents.

37:36.471 --> 37:38.734
And you were
the only person she told.

37:38.821 --> 37:42.390
She said she wanted
to make amends, but come on.

37:42.477 --> 37:43.783
It was a quarter
of a million dollars.

37:43.870 --> 37:45.175
I needed it.

37:48.309 --> 37:51.094
I convinced her to sneak out

37:51.181 --> 37:53.488
'go back to her place
to get the jewels.'

37:55.969 --> 37:56.970
[sobbing]

37:58.580 --> 38:00.930
'I said that she should
give them back'

38:01.017 --> 38:03.759
'to her parents at her
30-day chip ceremony'

38:03.846 --> 38:06.414
'that I was...proud of her.'

38:12.333 --> 38:14.509
I pulled over

38:14.596 --> 38:16.772
told her I thought
I had a flat.

38:20.167 --> 38:22.517
'I'd heard about that park
from some of my other patients'

38:22.604 --> 38:24.954
'that it was a place to score.'

38:31.091 --> 38:32.266
[grunting]

38:33.615 --> 38:35.313
I knew how it would look.

38:37.489 --> 38:38.490
[engine revving]

38:44.800 --> 38:46.541
So you killed her

38:46.628 --> 38:50.893
and you took the necklace
back to Oasis Ranch

38:50.980 --> 38:54.244
and you let her parents believe
that she died buying drugs?

38:56.029 --> 38:57.335
I'm powerless.

38:59.075 --> 39:00.425
It's a disease.

39:12.828 --> 39:15.701
Checkmate.

39:15.788 --> 39:18.834
Hey, Jane. I got Manchester
to sign the warrant.

39:18.921 --> 39:20.749
'I'm going to meet Van Pelt.'

39:20.836 --> 39:23.491
Huh, excellent police work
prevails yet again.

39:24.927 --> 39:26.059
'Grieving parents
at 12 O'clock.'

39:28.235 --> 39:30.759
Mr. Jane, thank you.

39:30.846 --> 39:32.544
Thank you, sir.

39:32.631 --> 39:34.676
Much appreciated.
It's my pleasure.

39:34.763 --> 39:36.765
I'll-I..
I was just heading..

39:36.852 --> 39:39.638
I'll-I'll leave you to it.

39:39.725 --> 39:43.206
I have something for you.

39:43.293 --> 39:44.730
Your necklace.

39:44.817 --> 39:47.167
Charlie was trying
to get it back for you.

39:47.254 --> 39:49.387
Thank you.

39:49.474 --> 39:52.346
I want you to know that
your daughter changed.

39:52.433 --> 39:53.652
She knew that
she hurt you both

39:53.739 --> 39:56.132
and she wanted
to make it right.

39:56.219 --> 39:57.482
She loved you.

40:00.093 --> 40:01.660
Our baby.

40:03.009 --> 40:04.445
Our poor baby.

40:14.237 --> 40:17.676
Hello, Teresa.
How are you today?

40:17.763 --> 40:20.026
Fantastic, actually.

40:20.113 --> 40:22.681
Oh, I can imagine.

40:22.768 --> 40:26.075
The thrill of
the chase and all that.

40:26.162 --> 40:29.339
I'm not sure I know what
you're referring to, Mr. Volker.

40:29.427 --> 40:31.951
Oh, don't be modest.

40:32.038 --> 40:34.823
I'm calling to
congratulate you.

40:34.910 --> 40:36.477
The warrant for Charles Milk.

40:39.175 --> 40:40.699
How did you know about that?

40:40.786 --> 40:43.005
Oh, I have my ways.

40:43.092 --> 40:44.877
At any rate..

40:44.964 --> 40:47.749
...you won't find
what you're looking for.

40:47.836 --> 40:50.491
Charles Milk did a few
personal security jobs for me

40:50.578 --> 40:51.971
nothing more.

40:52.058 --> 40:54.408
But, hey, he's a great guy.

40:54.495 --> 40:56.018
I'm sure you'll enjoy him.

40:56.105 --> 40:58.064
If that's it,
I've got another call.

40:58.151 --> 41:01.459
By all means,
you should take that.

41:04.636 --> 41:06.376
Van Pelt, I'm on my way.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.204
We're too late.

41:13.340 --> 41:14.515
[train horn blowing]

41:20.869 --> 41:23.089
We've just ID'd them all.

41:25.004 --> 41:27.093
'We've got a married couple,
Bob and Sara Miller'

41:27.180 --> 41:30.052
'and this gentleman
is Charles Milk.'

41:30.139 --> 41:31.750
What happened here?

41:31.837 --> 41:34.404
Drive-by shooting.
Some gang BS.

41:34.492 --> 41:35.754
These three were just
in the wrong place

41:35.841 --> 41:36.798
at the wrong time.

41:38.757 --> 41:40.846
Uh, Lisbon?

41:40.933 --> 41:42.630
Jane.

41:42.717 --> 41:43.979
I need your help.

41:47.200 --> 41:48.854
Mmm.

41:48.941 --> 41:51.291
[instrumental music]

42:03.956 --> 42:06.219
[theme music]

42:17.665 --> 42:20.538
[music continues]
