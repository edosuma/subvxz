00:34.550 --> 00:35.629
Ahem.

00:35.712 --> 00:37.632
They're ready for you.

00:40.152 --> 00:42.052
Gwendolyn Harris. We've met.

00:42.052 --> 00:43.290
Bournemouth.

00:43.291 --> 00:45.011
But you don't know the others.

00:45.012 --> 00:47.130
No, but I'm familiar with you.

00:47.131 --> 00:49.650
Why do you want to be an MP?

00:49.651 --> 00:52.129
Because I'm not satisfied
with the way things are,

00:52.130 --> 00:55.411
and rather than sit back and moan
I'd prefer to do something about it.

00:56.451 --> 00:57.729
Go again from the top.

00:57.730 --> 01:01.249
I don't know why anyone's surprised
the world's number one teen idol

01:01.250 --> 01:02.809
has become a Scientologist.

01:02.810 --> 01:04.369
Speed up the autocue, please.

01:04.370 --> 01:06.529
Pop stars do believe in weird things.

01:06.530 --> 01:09.929
'Abba believed in angels.
R Kelly believed he could fly...'

01:09.930 --> 01:11.169
They said show you this.

01:11.170 --> 01:12.651
This happened just now?

01:12.652 --> 01:13.330
Mm-hmm.

01:13.331 --> 01:14.810
Gladwell?

01:14.811 --> 01:17.529
"Shamed Tory Jason Gladwell
resigns," - capitals -

01:17.530 --> 01:19.449
"over Twitter porn pics scandal."

01:19.450 --> 01:20.969
Oh, so he wasn't hacked after all.

01:20.970 --> 01:23.249
"Originally claimed
his account had been hacked,

01:23.250 --> 01:26.249
"resignation statement admits
inappropriate correspondence

01:26.250 --> 01:27.449
"with a 15-year-old girl."

01:27.450 --> 01:30.449
So tweeting dick photos
is correspondence now, is it?

01:30.450 --> 01:32.369
"Departure triggers a by-election

01:32.370 --> 01:34.809
"in his Stentonford and Hersham
constituency."

01:34.810 --> 01:36.331
Well, you get to use
the Gladwell stuff.

01:36.332 --> 01:37.370
Mm-hmm.

01:37.371 --> 01:39.611
Bump it all up to
the top of the monologue.

01:39.612 --> 01:41.291
Anyone seen Jamie?

01:47.091 --> 01:48.170
Rach?

01:48.171 --> 01:50.449
'You really shouldn't be
calling me any more.

01:50.450 --> 01:52.171
'You need to sort yourself out.'

01:52.172 --> 01:53.690
I am.

01:53.691 --> 01:56.171
'Focus on Waldo,
that's going well for you.'

01:56.172 --> 01:57.450
But it is not...

01:57.451 --> 01:59.330
'He's a hit, Jamie.'

01:59.331 --> 02:01.810
"He." Not me, "he".

02:01.811 --> 02:03.450
'Just do your show.'

02:03.451 --> 02:05.291
I will. I mean, hon,
if you'd just...

02:06.531 --> 02:08.091
Jamie?

02:09.251 --> 02:10.851
Jamie, hurry up.

02:11.891 --> 02:14.371
What do you know about
Stentonford and Hersham?

02:14.372 --> 02:16.090
Safe Tory seat.

02:16.091 --> 02:19.531
So, realistically, I know there's
not much of a chance, but...

02:19.532 --> 02:22.370
So, it's a stepping stone for you?

02:22.371 --> 02:23.931
Yes.

02:25.371 --> 02:28.529
Obviously, I wouldn't say
that outside of this room,

02:28.530 --> 02:30.609
but, well,
you want me to be honest.

02:30.610 --> 02:32.329
There's no point in pretending.

02:32.330 --> 02:36.731
Is there anything in your past that
might conceivably cause problems?

02:36.732 --> 02:38.131
No.

02:39.371 --> 02:40.971
Except...

02:42.091 --> 02:44.731
I did commit a series
of murders in Huddersfield

02:44.732 --> 02:46.730
between 1999 and 2003.

02:46.731 --> 02:48.331
But apart from that...

02:52.171 --> 02:54.610
Well, thank you, Gwendolyn.

02:54.611 --> 02:56.531
If you could leave via that door.

02:56.532 --> 02:58.290
Oh, that door?

02:58.291 --> 03:00.331
We like to keep
the candidates separate.

03:01.371 --> 03:02.891
Right, yes.

03:13.811 --> 03:17.091
Idiot. Idiot!

03:18.651 --> 03:22.171
Shamed super groomer and all-round
pillock of the community

03:22.172 --> 03:25.290
Jason Gladwell
has resigned as an MP,

03:25.291 --> 03:28.970
saying he could no longer
maintain his position.

03:28.971 --> 03:31.251
That position, presumably,
being hunched over

03:31.252 --> 03:33.450
wanking madly at school kids.

03:33.451 --> 03:34.971
'A pal of Gladwell said...'

03:34.972 --> 03:35.890
You ready?

03:35.891 --> 03:37.170
Uh-huh.

03:37.171 --> 03:39.290
How old the girl wasn't.

03:39.291 --> 03:40.929
That's the sort of feeble excuse

03:40.930 --> 03:43.649
'only a naive school kid
would swallow -

03:43.650 --> 03:45.531
'which, presumably, was the idea.

03:46.811 --> 03:49.569
'Anyway, the bad news is
he's resigned in disgrace.'

03:49.570 --> 03:52.811
The good news is he's now
free to pursue a full-time career

03:52.812 --> 03:55.491
in the disgraced paedophile
industry.

03:57.091 --> 03:59.651
Personally, I don't understand
why anyone's surprised...

03:59.652 --> 04:01.930
Um, small change to the intro.

04:01.931 --> 04:03.010
What?

04:03.011 --> 04:06.089
- Nothing huge, Conor wanted the Jacko
gag for the monologue, so...
- That was my bit.

04:06.090 --> 04:08.809
- There is the Chancellor stuff,
you could use that.
- Bit politics.

04:08.810 --> 04:09.691
You can do politics.

04:09.692 --> 04:11.210
I do piss-taking.

04:11.211 --> 04:12.330
Go be Waldo.

04:12.331 --> 04:13.530
Yes, commander.

04:13.531 --> 04:15.449
'R Kelly believed he could fly,

04:15.450 --> 04:18.771
'and Michael Jackson believed
that his doctor was qualified...'

04:18.772 --> 04:20.850
Big ball blue bear bollocks.

04:20.851 --> 04:22.649
And now it's time
for our final visit

04:22.650 --> 04:25.089
to the world of educational
children's programming

04:25.090 --> 04:26.689
courtesy of everyone's favourite,

04:26.690 --> 04:30.091
and only occasionally inappropriate
cool kids' TV character,

04:30.092 --> 04:31.451
Waldo.

04:34.371 --> 04:36.970
Whose mum's in tonight, apparently.

04:36.971 --> 04:39.731
Waldo, who have you had
in your cave this week?

04:39.732 --> 04:43.090
Well, Conor,
in my big pink cave this week

04:43.091 --> 04:46.089
I had former Minister
for Culture Liam Monroe.

04:46.090 --> 04:48.011
Oh, he's quite handsome, isn't he?

04:48.012 --> 04:50.290
I was hoping he'd nosh me off!

04:50.291 --> 04:52.091
Want to see how it panned out?

04:52.092 --> 04:53.730
I think we should.

04:53.731 --> 04:55.091
Run VT!

05:07.971 --> 05:09.410
Hey, everybody!

05:09.411 --> 05:11.370
It's Waldo time!

05:11.371 --> 05:12.850
Yeah!

05:12.851 --> 05:14.410
Cool! Cool!

05:14.411 --> 05:17.370
Waldo-rrific!

05:17.371 --> 05:18.770
Ha-ha-ha!

05:18.771 --> 05:22.250
Hey, kids,
my guest this week is Mr Monroe.

05:22.251 --> 05:23.850
Hello, Mr Monroe.

05:23.851 --> 05:25.130
Hello, Waldo.

05:25.131 --> 05:28.291
Mr Monroe is a politician.

05:32.451 --> 05:34.930
So, what is a politician, Mr Monroe?

05:34.931 --> 05:36.849
Well, a politician is someone

05:36.850 --> 05:39.531
who tries to make the
world a fairer place.

05:39.532 --> 05:41.090
Like Batman.

05:41.091 --> 05:43.050
Not exactly like Batman.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.890
Do you beat people up?

05:44.891 --> 05:46.329
No, I don't beat people up.

05:46.330 --> 05:47.851
Oh, you're a pussy then?

05:49.691 --> 05:51.651
Well, I'm not sure
I know exactly what...

05:51.652 --> 05:54.211
You don't know what pussy is?

05:56.931 --> 05:59.491
OK, this is clearly
some kind of joke.

05:59.492 --> 06:02.090
No joke, sorry, let's move on.

06:02.091 --> 06:03.371
Friends again?

06:13.131 --> 06:15.450
Oh, hello, mate, great show.

06:15.451 --> 06:16.609
Well done, really good.

06:16.610 --> 06:17.849
So, we'll bring him over.

06:17.850 --> 06:19.689
You go and get him,
I'll explain about...

06:19.690 --> 06:21.291
'Now, he comes across...'

06:21.292 --> 06:22.810
Jamie!

06:22.811 --> 06:24.850
What you want, Miss Tamsin?

06:24.851 --> 06:27.009
Behind me, man in glasses
talking to Jack Napier.

06:27.010 --> 06:29.089
- Jack freaks me out.
- Yeah, ditto,

06:29.090 --> 06:32.410
but he owns the company and the man he's
with is important and wants to talk to you.

06:33.371 --> 06:34.930
He's from the channel.

06:34.931 --> 06:36.490
Go on.

06:36.491 --> 06:38.649
- 'Honestly, all I'm saying...'
- 'Is he shy?'

06:38.650 --> 06:40.889
'No, all I'm saying is
he's a terrific guy...'

06:40.890 --> 06:42.131
Jim, Jamie, Jamie, Jim.

06:42.132 --> 06:43.250
How do you do?

06:43.251 --> 06:44.450
Jim, Jack, James.

06:44.451 --> 06:45.770
Jamie.

06:45.771 --> 06:48.210
Jim was just talking about Waldo.

06:48.211 --> 06:51.211
Yeah. Liam Monroe
has lodged a complaint.

06:52.331 --> 06:53.690
Toys out the pram.

06:53.691 --> 06:55.050
And that's...?

06:55.051 --> 06:56.410
Good press.

06:56.411 --> 06:58.649
It's so tough to get
a breakthrough these days,

06:58.650 --> 07:01.329
but when it does,
well, it's just fantastic.

07:01.330 --> 07:03.769
It's fantastic the way Waldo puts
the piss up Monroe.

07:03.770 --> 07:07.051
You know, all those twats,
it's punk, it's... it's...

07:07.052 --> 07:08.410
'Jack?'

07:08.411 --> 07:09.771
Excuse me.

07:11.251 --> 07:14.531
Well, Twitter can't get
enough of Waldo, loves him.

07:16.011 --> 07:19.051
Look, I know the show's
coming back again next year,

07:19.052 --> 07:21.451
but we want to see more of Waldo.

07:23.531 --> 07:25.011
They want to do a pilot.

07:25.012 --> 07:25.970
A Waldo pilot?

07:25.971 --> 07:28.131
Yeah. I mean, how does that sound?

07:28.132 --> 07:30.290
Yeah. Sounds good.

07:30.291 --> 07:33.490
Sounds stormin' Norman,
fucking stormin'.

07:33.491 --> 07:34.971
Going to give it to 'em.

07:54.851 --> 07:57.609
But look, we can't do sketches
without Waldo.

07:57.610 --> 07:59.569
It's a Waldo pilot,
it's a Waldo show,

07:59.570 --> 08:01.169
it's got to be Waldo, Waldo, Waldo.

08:01.170 --> 08:03.929
Realistically, there isn't
the budget for other animations.

08:03.930 --> 08:06.129
I mean live action,
other characters I can do.

08:06.130 --> 08:08.009
What about the Brown Knight?

08:08.010 --> 08:09.569
What, the crap crusader?

08:09.570 --> 08:11.409
We can look into the Brown Knight.

08:11.410 --> 08:14.131
But right now
let's find more Waldo ideas.

08:15.731 --> 08:19.089
The problem is, any guests
we book will be in on it.

08:19.090 --> 08:21.451
They know that Waldo's a joke,
the surprise is gone.

08:21.452 --> 08:23.410
So, we think round that.

08:23.411 --> 08:25.891
Hey, boys and girls!
It's Waldo time!

08:25.892 --> 08:28.051
Yeah! Ha-ha!

08:29.331 --> 08:31.130
He's awesome, isn't he?

08:31.131 --> 08:34.851
I mean, look - sod name in lights,
you're an app now, my brother.

08:37.211 --> 08:40.129
All right, Sara? How's the
think tanking going, good shit?

08:40.130 --> 08:42.131
Um, yeah, yeah,
we're making headway.

08:42.131 --> 08:43.610
Good.

08:43.611 --> 08:45.929
I see our friend Monroe
is in the news again,

08:45.930 --> 08:48.649
running in
the Stentonford by-election.

08:48.650 --> 08:50.251
We should get Waldo down there.

08:51.049 --> 08:53.287
Hey, that's not a bad idea,
actually.

08:53.288 --> 08:56.489
We get a van with a screen with
the image of Waldo on the side.

08:56.490 --> 08:57.688
Like it.

08:57.689 --> 08:59.927
And then, when Monroe's
doing a meet and greet,

08:59.928 --> 09:01.807
we just turn up
and just get under his skin.

09:01.808 --> 09:03.047
I love that, I love it.

09:03.048 --> 09:03.887
We've done Monroe.

09:03.987 --> 09:05.266
But it was a great bit.

09:05.267 --> 09:07.786
I'm not dumb or clever enough
to be political...

09:07.787 --> 09:11.146
Why don't we get Waldo
to stand for the by-election?

09:11.147 --> 09:13.466
- Get people to vote for him?
- He's not real.

09:13.467 --> 09:15.946
But people have stood as
fictional characters before.

09:15.947 --> 09:18.266
Do you think Screaming
Lord Sutch was his real name?

09:18.267 --> 09:20.546
We just put "commonly known as"
on the ballot.

09:20.547 --> 09:22.846
No-one's actually going to vote
for him, that's not the point.

09:22.940 --> 09:26.019
The point is, we get to hang around,
we're there for the count.

09:26.020 --> 09:28.701
Well, go on then, Sara,
whack it up there.

09:45.384 --> 09:47.783
'He's with a mum and baby group.'

09:47.784 --> 09:51.463
OK. Going live
in five... four... three two...

09:51.464 --> 09:54.142
'Thank you so much
for joining me this morning.'

09:54.143 --> 09:55.782
It's been incredibly informative

09:55.783 --> 09:58.984
and I think we should have a little
round of applause for the children,

09:58.985 --> 10:00.943
who were fantastic.

10:00.944 --> 10:03.463
Thank you, Naomi.

10:03.464 --> 10:05.344
Thank you for your time.

10:08.304 --> 10:09.783
Hey!

10:09.784 --> 10:12.343
Hey, it's me Waldo.

10:12.344 --> 10:14.783
Oh. I like your trainers, man!

10:14.784 --> 10:17.302
I'd wear trainers myself
but I can't cos I haven't got feet.

10:17.303 --> 10:18.344
I've got stumps.

10:19.824 --> 10:20.623
He's out.

10:20.624 --> 10:22.703
Hey, Mr Monroe! Mr Monroe.

10:22.704 --> 10:24.822
Hey! Did you get off with
any of the mums?

10:24.823 --> 10:26.944
Where'd you look while
they were breastfeeding?

10:26.945 --> 10:29.423
They got big milky tits, Mr Monroe!

10:29.424 --> 10:31.183
He said it!

10:31.184 --> 10:33.623
Mr Monroe, don't walk away from me!

10:33.624 --> 10:35.542
- I'm sorry about this, Liam.
- Hey, I'm being snubbed!

10:35.543 --> 10:38.262
Hey, don't ignore me.
Don't just get in your car.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.502
It's a death trap anyway,
look at it!

10:40.503 --> 10:42.544
Let's find out what we can about
the idiot inside that thing.

10:42.545 --> 10:43.544
Sure.

10:44.944 --> 10:46.544
Mr Monroe. Oi!

10:49.744 --> 10:51.943
'Stentonford Labour Party.'

10:51.944 --> 10:53.864
Right, you've got
a choice of styles,

10:53.865 --> 10:59.183
so just choose one from there.
Then you put your name in there.

10:59.184 --> 11:00.864
This is like bloody Moonpig.

11:02.184 --> 11:03.864
Don't knock the free mail out.

11:06.024 --> 11:08.904
Bet Liam Monroe doesn't use some
Fisher-Price leaflet app.

11:08.905 --> 11:10.424
He doesn't have to.

11:16.304 --> 11:19.102
Day one of the campaign
in Stentonford and Hersham,

11:19.103 --> 11:21.942
and Tory hopeful Liam Monroe
hits the ground running.

11:21.943 --> 11:24.822
The license fee is something
that's very close to my heart...

11:24.823 --> 11:27.224
'Mr Monroe, ey! Oh, oh, oh!
Look at me Mr Monroe, please!'

11:27.225 --> 11:29.823
Hey, over here! Hey, over here...

11:29.824 --> 11:31.823
Look over here, Mr Monroe...

11:31.824 --> 11:33.622
The Conservative Party
have been, er...

11:33.623 --> 11:37.222
Have been arguing for a reduction
of the license fee for...

11:37.223 --> 11:39.182
- Good morning, everybody.
- Pardon?

11:39.183 --> 11:40.624
Why you ignoring me, Mr Monroe?
Mr Monroe? Why you ignoring me?

11:40.625 --> 11:41.863
I beg your pardon.

11:41.864 --> 11:43.943
I'm sorry. It's rather loud.

11:43.944 --> 11:45.462
We have argued for a further
reduction in the license fee...

11:45.463 --> 11:47.382
Mr Monroe? Why you ignoring me?

11:47.383 --> 11:49.182
Mum with a pushchair -
drag her into it.

11:49.183 --> 11:50.624
Hey, you. Mum with the pushchair.

11:50.625 --> 11:54.623
Yeah, you. Ask Mr Monroe
why he's ignoring me.

11:54.624 --> 11:56.863
Why are you ignoring Waldo?

11:56.864 --> 12:00.263
'Mr Monroe, what's Waldo
done to you?'

12:00.264 --> 12:03.824
We should probably just shift
before this turns stupid.

12:05.104 --> 12:07.144
I'm not walking away from a cartoon.

12:08.984 --> 12:10.743
'I'm not ignoring you.'

12:10.744 --> 12:12.943
Yeah, you were, you upset me.

12:12.944 --> 12:15.063
You made Waldo sad.

12:15.064 --> 12:18.584
Wa-a-a-a-a-a-ah.

12:20.264 --> 12:23.944
Well, obviously, I'm absolutely
devastated that you're upset...

12:23.945 --> 12:26.144
WA-A-A-A-A-A-A...

12:28.464 --> 12:31.304
Let him get a word in.

12:32.584 --> 12:36.063
I'm not ignoring you
because there is no you.

12:36.064 --> 12:38.903
You are an image voiced
by a comedian -

12:38.904 --> 12:40.782
an alleged comedian,
more accurately.

12:40.783 --> 12:42.902
If I'm not real,
why you talking to him?

12:42.903 --> 12:44.864
And by "him" I mean me, knobber!

12:47.224 --> 12:49.744
There's no point in attempting
to converse with a cartoon.

12:49.745 --> 12:52.543
Ooh, "converse", Your Lordship!

12:52.544 --> 12:55.944
Thy flowery language doth give
me a right throbbing bone-on!

12:55.945 --> 12:57.704
Uh-ha-ha-ha-huh!

12:59.224 --> 13:01.103
Uh-er-ha-ha!

13:01.104 --> 13:03.223
Ha-ha-ha-ha-uh-uh-uh!

13:03.224 --> 13:06.783
Uh-uh-uh-oh! Huh!

13:06.784 --> 13:08.184
Finished.

13:15.504 --> 13:17.303
Drink?

13:17.304 --> 13:18.904
I've got e-mails.

13:25.424 --> 13:28.503
You know that's Gwendolyn Harris?

13:28.504 --> 13:29.784
The Labour candidate.

13:31.624 --> 13:33.384
Did you read my background doc?

13:33.385 --> 13:34.544
Yes.

13:36.104 --> 13:38.584
Why don't you read it tonight? Alone.

13:48.224 --> 13:51.424
I'll swing by about nine,
so have your breakfast first...

13:51.425 --> 13:53.463
Are you my dad?

13:53.464 --> 13:56.384
Apparently not. See you tomorrow.

13:58.184 --> 14:01.422
'..Waldo the bear left
Monroe in stunned silence.

14:01.423 --> 14:03.942
'The colourful Waldo
launched his own campaign

14:03.943 --> 14:06.784
'in typically loud and
crowd-pleasing style...'

14:10.024 --> 14:12.064
Someone's bold? Do I know you?

14:12.065 --> 14:14.423
Nice way to greet a voter...

14:14.424 --> 14:16.383
Sorry, I thought you were...

14:16.384 --> 14:19.383
Actually, I'm more of a rival.

14:19.384 --> 14:22.942
"Hey, Mr Monroe, Mr Monroe, why
are you ignoring me, Mr Monroe?"

14:22.943 --> 14:24.182
You're good at that!

14:24.183 --> 14:25.302
Because I am that.

14:25.303 --> 14:26.424
What? You're that thing?

14:26.425 --> 14:29.783
Waldo's not a thing, he's a bear.

14:29.784 --> 14:34.143
Liam Monroe calls him worse.
Nice work there, by the way.

14:34.144 --> 14:37.664
Yeah, well. It's dick jokes
at his expense basically.

14:37.665 --> 14:38.783
Another one?

14:38.784 --> 14:40.224
OK. One.

14:44.424 --> 14:47.624
The way you describe it, it's like
you're doing this for a showreel...

14:47.625 --> 14:48.663
No...

14:48.664 --> 14:51.384
like this place is the equivalent
of a walk-on in a sketch show...

14:51.385 --> 14:52.423
Shh!

14:52.424 --> 14:54.802
But your party leader has to show
up because it's a... mid-thing...

14:54.891 --> 14:56.090
Midterm by-election.

14:56.091 --> 14:57.132
Terminology tits.

14:57.133 --> 14:58.331
You are 12!

14:58.332 --> 15:00.290
So because leaderballs is there,

15:00.291 --> 15:03.330
suddenly it's walk-on
in a Ricky Gervais sketch show

15:03.331 --> 15:04.690
so it's good exposure.

15:04.691 --> 15:07.210
- You're not going to win, you know
you're not going to win...
- Come on, shh.

15:07.211 --> 15:09.252
You're not going to win though.

15:09.253 --> 15:10.291
Of course not.

15:10.292 --> 15:11.490
So, why not be honest?

15:11.491 --> 15:13.530
Say, "You arseholes aren't
going to vote for me,

15:13.531 --> 15:14.970
"so here's what I think anyway."?

15:14.971 --> 15:18.412
- It doesn't work like that.
- Nothing does, that's why
everything's bollocksed.

15:18.413 --> 15:21.611
You're angry, for someone
who's doing well.

15:21.612 --> 15:25.531
I'm the voice of a blue bear...

15:25.532 --> 15:28.292
if that's, "doing well,"
then we are doomed!

15:32.412 --> 15:33.491
I can't see!

15:33.492 --> 15:35.012
Hang on, there's a thing.

15:38.292 --> 15:41.892
Have you had a fox in here or do you
live like a 14-year-old?

15:46.332 --> 15:48.532
Well, don't get too excited,
I'm not sleeping in it.

15:48.533 --> 15:49.892
Shit, really?

16:06.772 --> 16:07.811
You're amazing.

16:07.812 --> 16:08.971
Sorry?

16:08.972 --> 16:10.811
You're amazing?

16:10.812 --> 16:12.452
Oh, thank you!

16:36.172 --> 16:37.851
What's up?

16:37.852 --> 16:39.411
Nothing.

16:39.412 --> 16:40.732
Are you sure?

16:45.732 --> 16:47.172
It's just...

16:51.172 --> 16:53.892
I haven't been happy in a while...

16:55.892 --> 16:58.691
and this is good, you know?

16:58.692 --> 16:59.732
Hm.

17:09.892 --> 17:12.732
Can I... have your number?

17:16.652 --> 17:18.172
Yes!

17:35.372 --> 17:37.092
Where's our mark this morning?

17:37.093 --> 17:38.611
We're out on the road.

17:38.612 --> 17:40.732
Ooh... bien sur.

17:44.252 --> 17:52.011
Oh, hello, I'm Mr Monroe.
Vote for me and keep things shitty.

17:52.012 --> 17:54.092
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

18:15.532 --> 18:22.372
Vote Waldo! Vote Waldo!

18:25.092 --> 18:26.692
'You're right. Strong Tory.'

18:26.693 --> 18:27.971
'I warned you.'

18:27.972 --> 18:31.572
You know you're on Monroe turf
when they live so far apart.

18:33.452 --> 18:35.012
I'm voting Waldo!

18:38.652 --> 18:40.971
I met Waldo last night.

18:40.972 --> 18:42.892
Jamie, the guy who plays him.

18:42.893 --> 18:44.011
He's fun.

18:44.012 --> 18:45.611
Fun?

18:45.612 --> 18:46.652
Mmm-hmm.

18:48.612 --> 18:51.212
Did you tell him anything
about our campaign?

18:51.213 --> 18:52.771
Not really.

18:52.772 --> 18:54.412
Not really or no?

18:55.932 --> 18:57.172
Er, not really.

18:58.136 --> 18:59.335
Look, he's OK.

18:59.336 --> 19:00.535
He's a comedian -

19:00.536 --> 19:02.976
he's mocking Monroe now,
it'll be you next.

19:05.016 --> 19:07.935
His act is all f-this
and penis jokes.

19:07.936 --> 19:09.015
But...

19:09.016 --> 19:10.896
Don't see him again.

19:17.576 --> 19:20.576
OK. Job done till
the husting tomorrow.

19:21.656 --> 19:24.694
Some media students doing
a Question Time type thing.

19:24.695 --> 19:26.694
They've asked Waldo
to join the panel.

19:26.695 --> 19:29.774
Oh, come on. It's my nightmare,
going on Question Time.

19:29.775 --> 19:31.014
It's students, you'll walk it.

19:31.015 --> 19:32.774
I can't answer
serious questions...

19:32.775 --> 19:36.016
No-one wants you to!
You're the comic relief, lighten up.

19:47.696 --> 19:51.536
Erm, just have a look. I'm sure
you'll find lots in there...

19:54.056 --> 19:59.336
Are there any particular issues that
you're concerned about at all?

20:14.816 --> 20:16.055
Hey.

20:16.056 --> 20:17.095
Oh, hi.

20:17.096 --> 20:19.294
- I thought we were going to...?
- Sorry - I've had a tough day...

20:19.295 --> 20:20.536
Right. Not even one?

20:20.537 --> 20:22.175
Sorry.

20:22.176 --> 20:23.736
Well, what about tomorrow?

20:25.176 --> 20:27.776
- Look, I can't, when this is happening,
I can't see you.
- What do you mean?

20:27.777 --> 20:28.896
I'm sorry.

20:41.438 --> 20:43.958
Do they think that
looks like Question Time?

20:43.959 --> 20:45.998
Yeah. It looks politicsy.

20:47.518 --> 20:49.437
Check the host.

20:49.442 --> 20:50.602
Jailbait Dimbleby.

20:58.162 --> 21:02.322
When it comes to addiction
and addicts, we should sympathise,

21:02.362 --> 21:04.520
but we shouldn't patronise.

21:04.521 --> 21:07.919
You know, serious drug use is
a criminal of fence, that is

21:07.920 --> 21:10.521
committed voluntarily
and for pleasure...

21:11.721 --> 21:14.039
Look, I'm sorry, these are the
facts.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.399
Waldo, what do you think?

21:15.400 --> 21:17.041
Mr Monroe, are you addicted?

21:17.042 --> 21:18.760
No.

21:18.761 --> 21:20.681
Sorry, I mean, are you a dickhead?

21:23.481 --> 21:24.999
I think we have to ask ourselves...

21:25.000 --> 21:28.479
I think we have to ask ourselves,
what is this for?

21:28.480 --> 21:32.401
And why do we waste our time with
animated trivialities like him?

21:34.161 --> 21:35.240
I mean why?

21:35.241 --> 21:36.400
Why? I mean why?

21:36.401 --> 21:38.400
I mean why? I mean why?

21:38.401 --> 21:39.919
I mean why? I mean why?

21:39.920 --> 21:43.399
This is just the kind of thing...
rather than see you laugh...

21:43.400 --> 21:44.959
They laugh at you, Limbo.

21:44.960 --> 21:47.439
You laugh, you're laughing
at someone who won't engage.

21:47.440 --> 21:51.761
Who is scared to engage, who
hides behind a children's cartoon.

21:51.762 --> 21:54.560
Who you calling a kiddy toon, fool?

21:54.561 --> 21:59.400
I'm... I'm... I'm
speaking about James Salter.

21:59.401 --> 22:00.681
Hm?

22:02.161 --> 22:04.440
Don't worry about it.

22:04.441 --> 22:06.520
That's your name, isn't it?

22:06.521 --> 22:09.041
James Salter, this is the man
who's behind all this.

22:09.042 --> 22:11.960
He's 33 years old,

22:11.961 --> 22:15.799
a man whose career can be summed up
surprisingly quickly.

22:15.800 --> 22:17.319
You were in a sketch troupe

22:17.320 --> 22:19.719
that enjoyed minor success about
six years ago,

22:19.720 --> 22:21.799
and the others moved on to
better things,

22:21.800 --> 22:24.559
but your main achievement seems to
have been playing

22:24.560 --> 22:26.239
the part of a corn on the cob

22:26.240 --> 22:29.241
in a high-interest personal
loan commercial.

22:30.681 --> 22:32.559
I notice you keep that
pretty quiet.

22:32.560 --> 22:35.719
And now of course operating
this sort of teddy bear thing.

22:35.720 --> 22:38.561
Which by the way is easier than it
looks. Anyone could do it.

22:38.562 --> 22:45.040
See, this is... this is the thing.
It's easy, what he does.

22:45.041 --> 22:46.560
He mocks.

22:46.561 --> 22:49.079
And when he can't
think of an authentic joke,

22:49.080 --> 22:51.881
which is actually quite often,
he just swears.

22:52.881 --> 22:56.999
I think that this puppet's
inclusion on this panel debases the

22:57.000 --> 23:01.079
process of debate, and smothers any
meaningful discussion of the issues.

23:01.080 --> 23:05.679
So I return to my original question,
is that really what this is for?

23:05.680 --> 23:08.761
He has nothing to offer
and he has nothing to say.

23:08.762 --> 23:11.560
Prove me wrong. Hm?

23:11.561 --> 23:13.640
Speak, Waldo.

23:13.641 --> 23:17.841
Please. Come on. Speak up.

23:21.001 --> 23:23.280
There you see, nothing.

23:23.281 --> 23:24.521
Oh, go fuck yourself.

23:26.641 --> 23:28.400
It's more swearing.

23:28.401 --> 23:29.680
You're a joke.

23:29.681 --> 23:30.959
You look less human than I do

23:30.960 --> 23:33.121
and I'm a made-up bear with
a turquoise cock.

23:36.401 --> 23:40.440
What are you? You're just an old
attitude with new hair.

23:40.441 --> 23:43.359
Assuming you're my superior because
I'm not taking you seriously?

23:43.360 --> 23:45.719
No-one takes you seriously,
that's why no-one votes.

23:45.720 --> 23:47.039
The vast majority do vote.

23:47.040 --> 23:47.879
It's bullshit.

23:47.880 --> 23:49.199
Surely this is enough?

23:49.200 --> 23:50.799
You think you deserve respect.

23:50.800 --> 23:51.879
Just common courtesy.

23:51.880 --> 23:53.359
Because you went to public school

23:53.360 --> 23:55.519
and believed you were
entitled to everything.

23:55.520 --> 23:57.639
- Perhaps we could get back...
- Ad hominem nonsense...

23:57.640 --> 23:58.719
Gwendolyn Harris...

23:58.720 --> 24:01.839
Something's got to change. No-one
trusts you lot cos they know

24:01.840 --> 24:04.519
you don't give a shit about anything
outside your bubble.

24:04.520 --> 24:07.239
What about your mate Gladwell,
the kiddy-flasher?

24:07.240 --> 24:10.039
You knew him for 20 years,
did you not know what he was like?

24:10.040 --> 24:11.121
No, of course not.

24:11.122 --> 24:15.520
Yeah, cos you're all just front,
like him, sly and pretending,

24:15.521 --> 24:17.521
and in that way you're all the same.

24:17.522 --> 24:22.320
Gwendolyn Harris,
is all of politics a waste of time?

24:22.321 --> 24:24.800
Well, of course I think no...

24:24.801 --> 24:27.760
Oh, shut up, you're worse!

24:27.761 --> 24:29.639
Seriously, she's faker than him.

24:29.640 --> 24:32.719
- For once I agree with Liam Monroe
in that this...
- Are you going to win?

24:32.720 --> 24:35.919
Doesn't get us anywhere and
there's no point in us continuing...

24:35.920 --> 24:37.399
Tell them why you're here.

24:37.400 --> 24:38.921
If we can't have anything
resembling a deba...

24:38.922 --> 24:40.961
Tell them why you're here.

24:44.121 --> 24:46.240
She's here to build a showreel.

24:46.241 --> 24:48.799
I'm not kidding, that's literally
it.

24:48.800 --> 24:51.041
Knows she's not going to win.
This is all experience,

24:51.042 --> 24:52.320
to get on telly.

24:52.321 --> 24:54.919
She actually gives less of a shit
about anyone round here than

24:54.920 --> 24:57.321
he does, because he'll actually
have to represent you.

24:57.322 --> 24:58.520
Am I wrong?

24:58.521 --> 25:02.520
A career politician.
Someone else less real than me,

25:02.521 --> 25:03.801
and I can do this.

25:08.001 --> 25:09.881
Can I just make
a couple of points?

25:09.882 --> 25:11.600
Oh, shut up, you pebble.

25:11.601 --> 25:14.319
What is this for? That's what you
wanted to know, Mr Monroe.

25:14.320 --> 25:17.321
And the truth is, none of us
know any more, thanks to you.

25:17.322 --> 25:20.520
What are you for? What are you for?

25:20.521 --> 25:22.321
Thank you and goodnight.

26:13.081 --> 26:15.041
Jamie.

26:16.841 --> 26:18.001
Jamie?

26:19.641 --> 26:21.961
Jack's here. He wants to see us.

26:23.361 --> 26:24.441
You can't avoid it.

26:29.801 --> 26:33.081
Get dressed, he'll meet us outside.

26:47.481 --> 26:49.641
'And yet accusations of vapidity
aside,

26:49.642 --> 26:51.960
'it's clearly tapped a nerve.

26:51.961 --> 26:54.719
'In just three days, Waldo has gone
viral.

26:54.720 --> 26:58.639
'The video of his clash has already
been viewed over a million times

26:58.640 --> 27:01.961
'on YouTube. There are Facebook
groups calling on Waldo

27:01.962 --> 27:04.760
'to form a national party.'

27:04.761 --> 27:06.480
'You're a joke.

27:06.481 --> 27:09.519
'You look less human than I do
and I'm a made-up bear with

27:09.520 --> 27:11.719
'a turquoise (BLEEP) What are you?

27:11.720 --> 27:14.399
'You're just an old attitude
with new hair.

27:14.400 --> 27:18.361
'Assuming you're my superior because
I'm not taking you seriously.

27:18.362 --> 27:21.161
'No-one takes you (BLEEP)
seriously.'

27:29.361 --> 27:31.559
Oh, look, here
he is the man of the moment!

27:31.560 --> 27:33.281
How does it feel to be a phenomenon?

27:33.282 --> 27:34.281
Shitifying.

27:35.801 --> 27:37.399
You are everywhere, my son.

27:37.400 --> 27:39.521
Twitter, the news...
Have you seen the poll?

27:39.522 --> 27:41.720
You're in third place, mate.

27:41.721 --> 27:43.359
You overtook that Lib Dem prick...

27:43.360 --> 27:46.001
- Yeah, well, he's a glass of water.
- This is an opportunity, Jamie.

27:46.002 --> 27:48.040
He knows my name now.

27:48.041 --> 27:49.839
We could really do something here.

27:49.840 --> 27:52.199
You know, everyone's pissed
with the status quo.

27:52.200 --> 27:54.041
And Waldo gives that a voice.

27:54.042 --> 27:56.800
Waldo's a bear. A blue bear.

27:56.801 --> 27:58.400
Tell him, Tams.

27:58.401 --> 28:00.640
We've been asked on Consensus.

28:00.641 --> 28:04.041
It's a ten-minute one-to-one
interview with Phillip Crane.

28:04.042 --> 28:05.160
Pitbull Crane?

28:05.161 --> 28:06.239
Big guns for big guns.

28:06.240 --> 28:09.519
Hello? I'm not a politician, OK?
I don't want to be a politician.

28:09.520 --> 28:10.879
We know that you hate politics.

28:10.880 --> 28:13.439
I don't hate them,
I'm just not interested in them.

28:13.440 --> 28:15.159
You don't need to be
interested in them.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.481
You just need to be Waldo.

28:17.921 --> 28:21.401
And when Crane asks something tricky and I look
stupid because I don't know how to answer?

28:21.402 --> 28:23.480
You'll know the answer.

28:23.481 --> 28:25.241
Because you have a producer.

28:25.242 --> 28:28.720
Look, I can tell you what to say.

28:28.721 --> 28:31.639
I can live Google any facts,
give you stats, quotes,

28:31.640 --> 28:32.679
whatever else you need.

28:32.680 --> 28:34.919
So you've got a safety
net for the concrete stuff

28:34.920 --> 28:37.481
and the rest is Waldo
and you can do that in your sleep.

28:37.482 --> 28:39.520
You'll piss all over Crane.

28:39.521 --> 28:41.599
He'll know there's a team around me,
he'll see it.

28:41.600 --> 28:44.199
Yeah good. I hope he does.
I hope he points a camera at it.

28:44.200 --> 28:47.281
All the other MPs have got teams,
we're just more honest about it.

28:47.282 --> 28:49.721
Now come on. What d'you say? Eh?

28:52.782 --> 28:54.181
Jamie! Jamie!

28:54.182 --> 28:55.420
Why would I want to do this?

28:55.421 --> 28:58.460
Look, the world is knackered
and you can do something about it.

28:58.461 --> 28:59.940
I don't know what you're on about.

28:59.941 --> 29:02.860
Waldo has got the attention
of the young, and the young don't

29:02.861 --> 29:05.860
give a shit about anything
except trainers and pirating films.

29:05.861 --> 29:08.620
Do you have any other astounding
theories about young people?

29:08.621 --> 29:12.220
Yeah, yeah I do actually.
Look, they care about Waldo.

29:12.221 --> 29:13.580
They'll vote for Waldo.

29:13.581 --> 29:15.060
The video was a hit for a reason.

29:15.061 --> 29:17.380
The video's embarrassing.
I'm embarrassed by it.

29:17.381 --> 29:19.300
I was lashing out.
I wasn't even articulate -

29:19.301 --> 29:21.500
Doesn't matter.
Or funny, which is almost worse.

29:21.501 --> 29:22.780
We can build on that.

29:22.781 --> 29:23.860
Waldo's not real.

29:23.861 --> 29:27.660
Exactly! That's what you said that
really hit home. He's not real,

29:27.661 --> 29:29.220
but he's realer than all the others.

29:29.221 --> 29:30.900
He doesn't stand for anything.

29:30.901 --> 29:33.342
Yeah, well, at least
he doesn't pretend to.

29:33.343 --> 29:35.861
Look we... we don't need politicians,

29:35.862 --> 29:38.700
we've all got iPhones
and computers, right?

29:38.701 --> 29:42.260
So any decision that has to be made,
any policy, we just put it online.

29:42.261 --> 29:46.020
Let the people vote thumbs up,
thumbs down, the majority wins.

29:46.021 --> 29:48.900
That's a democracy. That's a...
that's an actual democracy.

29:48.901 --> 29:51.900
So's YouTube and I don't know
if you've seen it but the most

29:51.901 --> 29:55.942
popular video is a dog farting
the theme tune to Happy Days.

29:58.022 --> 29:59.861
Well, today it's Waldo.

29:59.862 --> 30:02.541
No. It's still the dog.

30:02.542 --> 30:05.180
Listen, can you imagine all
the things we can change

30:05.181 --> 30:07.220
if we fuck the politicians
out the equation?

30:07.221 --> 30:09.742
I've said what I've said
and now I'm shutting this door.

30:15.742 --> 30:17.781
Do you know who owns Waldo?

30:17.782 --> 30:18.982
I do, I own the rights.

30:21.542 --> 30:22.821
He's my character.

30:22.822 --> 30:24.462
Yeah, written for my show.

30:25.502 --> 30:30.221
You're too frightened to take to
the next level. Fine. I understand.

30:30.222 --> 30:32.101
But also, fuck off!

30:32.102 --> 30:33.062
And watch me fly.

30:33.063 --> 30:35.502
You own Waldo, you can't be Waldo.

30:38.182 --> 30:41.742
Eh, Jamie, Jamie,
Jamie, what's 'appenin, eh?

30:43.902 --> 30:45.182
Pretty close, I'd say.

30:50.852 --> 30:53.051
What's happenin'? Ahh!

30:53.058 --> 30:56.777
Waldorific, yeah! Yeah!

30:56.778 --> 30:58.136
Why is it going off left again?

30:58.137 --> 30:58.856
Because the...

30:58.857 --> 31:01.218
- I know! I've got my...
- Put your thumb in the white thing.

31:01.219 --> 31:03.137
I got that. In there? OK.

31:03.138 --> 31:04.818
That's not how that works.

31:13.778 --> 31:18.137
First tonight, a figure -
or more accurately a character -

31:18.138 --> 31:21.776
who's been causing an upset
in the Stentonford by-election.

31:21.777 --> 31:25.136
Unlike the other candidates,
he has no party affiliation.

31:25.137 --> 31:27.016
He doesn't even have a surname.

31:27.017 --> 31:31.418
He is Waldo, a few weeks ago just
a cult character in a comedy show.

31:31.419 --> 31:35.057
Today, an official
mascot for protest voters.

31:35.058 --> 31:36.217
Vote Waldo.

31:36.218 --> 31:39.576
Cartoons don't play by the rules
and Waldo's open disdain

31:39.577 --> 31:42.378
for his opponents
has clearly struck a chord.

31:45.018 --> 31:47.696
Waldo, as a mascot
for the disenfranchised, aren't you

31:47.697 --> 31:50.938
ultimately neutralizing seriously
effective dissent?

31:52.138 --> 31:54.056
Can I have subtitles for Mr Crane,
please?

31:54.057 --> 31:57.496
By encouraging people not to care,
you're actively dangerous.

31:57.497 --> 31:59.498
Dangerous? You think
the public can't be trusted?

31:59.499 --> 32:00.577
No.

32:00.578 --> 32:02.058
Isn't that basically you
calling them twats?

32:02.059 --> 32:03.057
No, I...

32:03.058 --> 32:04.137
Bell-ends then?

32:04.138 --> 32:05.736
Did you come for a discussion
or...

32:05.737 --> 32:08.936
You're snooty for a glorified
Punch And Judy man, Phil.

32:08.937 --> 32:11.776
You know you're gonna get your best
ratings in months cos I'm here.

32:11.777 --> 32:14.576
To even get close to the figures
I'm gonna pull in for you tonight,

32:14.577 --> 32:17.416
you'd have to fuck a prawn sandwich
live on air.

32:17.417 --> 32:19.056
Make a nice prawn cocktail.

32:19.057 --> 32:21.216
Could we make a serious
political point that is...

32:21.217 --> 32:23.136
I've got one big blue point
to make, fool.

32:23.137 --> 32:25.016
- Would you like to have a look at it?
- Oh, God. Thank you.

32:25.017 --> 32:27.776
Great work tonight. Look at... Look
at this, look at this.

32:27.777 --> 32:30.936
It's The Waldo polling app.
Now, this can pinpoint you with GPS

32:30.937 --> 32:32.776
so that when you're at a polling
station,

32:32.777 --> 32:34.338
it unlocks loads of free shit, look.

32:34.339 --> 32:38.337
Thanks for voting, dickhead!

32:38.338 --> 32:39.496
It's good, isn't it?

32:39.497 --> 32:40.936
Who's this guy we're meeting?

32:40.937 --> 32:44.858
I dunno. But he's from Washington
and he's got my restricted number.

32:48.218 --> 32:50.937
Jeff Carter, from the agency.

32:50.938 --> 32:51.577
Hey. Hey.

32:51.578 --> 32:52.856
And I'll leap right in.

32:52.857 --> 32:55.458
I think what you're doing
with Waldo is fascinating.

32:55.459 --> 32:56.777
From "the agency"?

32:56.778 --> 33:00.458
Yeah, listen. Waldo may be
the perfect political figurehead.

33:00.459 --> 33:01.937
Waldo The Bear.

33:01.938 --> 33:04.976
The bear, people like.
The fact he's a bear is an assist.

33:04.977 --> 33:06.496
- An assist?
- It helps.

33:06.497 --> 33:08.736
Right. You look at human
politicians,

33:08.737 --> 33:11.576
you're instinctively like,
"brrrr" - uncanny, right?

33:11.577 --> 33:12.776
Like the girls in porn.

33:12.777 --> 33:15.296
You know something's wrong,
cos why else are they doing it?

33:15.297 --> 33:16.976
It's usually daddy issues, eh?

33:16.977 --> 33:19.296
Just like politics.
Waldo bypasses that.

33:19.297 --> 33:21.778
You already know he's not real,
so no personal flaws.

33:21.779 --> 33:23.257
I'm a person.

33:23.258 --> 33:25.136
With respect, Waldo's more than you.

33:25.137 --> 33:28.778
He's a team, and you're open
about that, which is fantastic.

33:28.779 --> 33:30.737
The honesty thing works.

33:30.738 --> 33:35.017
Waldo is a construct
people not just accept but embrace.

33:35.018 --> 33:36.938
At the moment he's anti-politics,

33:36.939 --> 33:40.017
which is a political stance itself,
right?

33:40.018 --> 33:42.936
But he could deliver any brand
of political content,

33:42.937 --> 33:45.816
minus the potential downsides
of a human messenger.

33:45.817 --> 33:49.696
In a debate, your team could Google
every word the other guy says,

33:49.697 --> 33:51.696
then let Waldo hit him
with debunk stats

33:51.697 --> 33:54.898
and spit a Twitter-ready
zinger into the next sentence.

33:54.899 --> 33:57.217
He's the perfect assassin.

33:57.218 --> 33:58.938
We won't win, though.

34:02.658 --> 34:04.657
You guys are so British.

34:04.658 --> 34:08.775
No, of course he won't win. You
started out too coarse off the bat.

34:08.777 --> 34:11.978
There's no substantial basis
to what you offer, and the whole

34:11.978 --> 34:16.377
nihilist "democracy sucks" thing,
yeah, is kind of wack-a-doo,

34:16.378 --> 34:20.857
but with a targeted, hopeful
message, which we can provide,

34:20.858 --> 34:24.056
energising the disenfranchised
without spooking the middle

34:24.056 --> 34:28.538
via your new platform... You got
a global political-entertainment

34:28.539 --> 34:31.058
product people actually want.

34:32.578 --> 34:34.418
You could roll this out worldwide.

34:34.418 --> 34:36.337
Like Pringles.

34:36.338 --> 34:37.737
Absolutely.

34:42.578 --> 34:46.177
It's, er... It's interesting stuff
though.

34:46.178 --> 34:47.976
When you're done with Stentonford,

34:47.976 --> 34:50.578
there may be an opportunity
in South America.

34:50.579 --> 34:52.217
Se puede hablar espanol?

34:52.217 --> 34:54.657
Vivi en Madrid tres anos.

34:54.658 --> 34:56.498
Excelente.

35:15.458 --> 35:16.578
What?

35:17.978 --> 35:19.537
He's not coming.

35:19.538 --> 35:22.137
But he's the party leader!

35:22.138 --> 35:23.258
It's too toxic.

35:26.858 --> 35:29.256
Meanwhile,
as support for Gwendolyn Harris

35:29.257 --> 35:30.536
appears to be dwindling,

35:30.537 --> 35:34.416
Labour denies the party is losing
faith in their young candidate.

35:34.417 --> 35:37.098
But Miss Harris spent most of
the day locked in crisis talks

35:37.099 --> 35:38.338
at party headqu...

35:42.018 --> 35:46.298
In the Stentonford by-election,
Waldo the cartoon bear continues...

35:47.538 --> 35:50.016
Did you see Gwendolyn Harris
yesterday?

35:50.017 --> 35:52.098
She looks like she's been poisoned.

35:52.099 --> 35:54.497
Because he's gonna overtake her.

35:54.498 --> 35:55.896
We're still way ahead.

35:55.897 --> 35:59.218
If that thing is the main opposition
then the whole system looks absurd.

36:01.898 --> 36:04.377
Which it may well be.

36:04.378 --> 36:05.898
But it built these roads.

36:14.018 --> 36:15.858
Just come in, Roy.

36:22.098 --> 36:23.858
I'm sorry, OK?

36:25.338 --> 36:27.776
It was wrong to speak to you
like that and...

36:27.777 --> 36:30.218
After the campaign,
I would've called you.

36:31.378 --> 36:33.337
After the campaign!

36:33.338 --> 36:35.498
All you've done
is strengthen Monroe.

36:36.618 --> 36:40.456
You won't win either, but I was
at least attempting to represent...

36:40.457 --> 36:43.416
Well I don't know!
Not just "bollocks to everything".

36:43.417 --> 36:46.096
If you were preaching revolution,
well that'd be something,

36:46.097 --> 36:49.178
but you're not because that would
require courage and a mindset.

36:50.418 --> 36:51.818
And what have you got?

36:53.378 --> 36:54.578
Who are you?

36:56.018 --> 36:57.618
What are you for?

37:04.578 --> 37:05.858
Morning.

37:15.778 --> 37:17.657
So, final push.

37:17.658 --> 37:19.296
You remind everyone
that's got the app

37:19.297 --> 37:23.098
that if they recommend it to a friend
it unlocks a little fez for Waldo.

37:23.099 --> 37:24.178
We're here.

37:27.058 --> 37:29.377
Attention, shoppers.

37:29.378 --> 37:32.778
I'm here to ask you an important
favour. Gather round.

37:32.779 --> 37:34.938
Come over here and listen.

37:37.458 --> 37:40.577
Don't vote for me. I'm an insult.

37:40.578 --> 37:41.977
Seriously.

37:41.978 --> 37:45.137
Vote for Monroe or Harris
or, I dunno, UKIP,

37:45.138 --> 37:47.017
or even that Lib Dem guy.

37:47.018 --> 37:48.617
He's a prick!

37:48.618 --> 37:52.296
Seriously, only an arsehole
would actually vote for me.

37:52.297 --> 37:53.456
What is this? Irony?

37:53.457 --> 37:55.176
I'm worse than a wasted vote.

37:55.177 --> 37:56.896
He's from the Harris campaign.

37:56.897 --> 37:59.176
I mean it, you idiots!
Don't vote for me!

37:59.177 --> 38:01.378
Don't vote for me!
Don't vote for me!

38:01.379 --> 38:03.297
Don't vote for me!

38:03.298 --> 38:04.978
Don't vmmmf!

38:07.338 --> 38:08.497
Shut up.

38:08.498 --> 38:10.456
No. Don't boo him,
he's right! He's right!

38:10.457 --> 38:11.618
What are you doing?

38:11.619 --> 38:13.138
- Resigning.
- Jamie!

38:14.738 --> 38:16.537
Look! It's me, I'm Waldo.

38:16.538 --> 38:19.697
This guy, whoever this guy is,
he's a hero.

38:19.698 --> 38:22.096
You should throw stuff at Waldo,
he's bad bloody news.

38:22.097 --> 38:23.456
- He's funny!
- He's not.

38:23.457 --> 38:26.016
Don't listen to that man,
he's a lesbian. Ahh!

38:26.017 --> 38:29.616
So remember, the polls are open,
and if you've got my app, you can

38:29.617 --> 38:32.978
unlock new stuff like catchphrases
and a little hat 'n' that.

38:32.979 --> 38:37.377
Only an idiot wouldn't vote for me
so question the status quo!

38:37.378 --> 38:38.617
Kill it! Kill it!

38:38.618 --> 38:40.497
Kick them where it hurts.

38:40.498 --> 38:43.176
The first man to hit him
gets 500 quid!

38:43.177 --> 38:46.618
Yeah, that's right. Knock him down.
Knock him down.

38:46.619 --> 38:48.057
Smash it!

38:48.058 --> 38:50.217
Yeah! Yeah!

38:50.218 --> 38:54.578
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah...

39:03.858 --> 39:05.136
I, the undersigned,

39:05.137 --> 39:07.256
being the returning
officer for the Stentonford
