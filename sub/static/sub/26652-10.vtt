00:00.010 --> 00:01.550
<i>Previously on
"Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

00:01.556 --> 00:03.130
I have to keep you safe. Go!

00:03.148 --> 00:04.933
<i>You've had Mona
in custody this whole time?</i>

00:04.939 --> 00:06.102
<i>You have the Kaupe too?</i>

00:06.130 --> 00:07.660
<i>Sara, you need to
bring in that fugitive</i>

00:07.661 --> 00:09.540
<i>before someone gets hurt.</i>

00:09.554 --> 00:10.770
Step away
from the creature, miss.

00:10.850 --> 00:13.619
You murdered him.

00:13.620 --> 00:14.870
Today I asked you for one thing.

00:14.950 --> 00:16.720
- Ava, don't do this.
- Just go.

00:16.790 --> 00:18.430
<i>So I'll head to The Bureau
and do some digging?</i>

00:18.500 --> 00:20.670
<i>Hank is torturing prisoners
off site.</i>

00:20.750 --> 00:22.380
Keep digging.
I want to know everything.

00:22.460 --> 00:24.260
What do you mean
you couldn't capture the asset?

00:24.270 --> 00:26.770
<i>Blame it on your son's
time-traveling pals, sir.</i>

00:28.880 --> 00:30.510
<i>Let me just say this,</i>

00:30.590 --> 00:33.280
<i>and I want to say this
for the television news.</i>

00:33.350 --> 00:35.390
The people have a right to know

00:35.470 --> 00:38.440
whether or not
their president is a crook.

00:38.450 --> 00:40.370
Well, I am a crook.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.990
Oh, actually felt good
to get that off my chest.

00:43.070 --> 00:44.950
What other secrets
have I been holding back?

00:45.030 --> 00:48.530
Ah, yes, despite the constant
reassurances of my wife,

00:48.610 --> 00:51.530
I know that I'm certainly
only an adequate lover.

00:51.610 --> 00:52.620
Mr. President!

00:52.630 --> 00:53.950
<i>The President won't be taking</i>

00:53.960 --> 00:55.210
<i>any more questions at this time.</i>

00:55.280 --> 00:56.870
That is more about

00:56.950 --> 00:58.630
Tricky Dick than
I ever needed to know

00:58.710 --> 01:00.640
<i>And it's more than
the public needed to know.</i>

01:00.710 --> 01:02.380
<i>In the days following
the news conference,</i>

01:02.460 --> 01:04.470
<i>Nixon found himself
unable to tell a lie</i>

01:04.550 --> 01:05.810
<i>resulting in global chaos.</i>

01:05.880 --> 01:07.800
Nixon's blathering fouled up

01:07.880 --> 01:09.390
ongoing peace talks
and trade agreements.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.480
Without the release of
"All the President's Men,"

01:11.560 --> 01:13.390
Robert Redford's
career floundered.

01:13.470 --> 01:15.310
What?
No Redford?

01:15.390 --> 01:18.100
No Sundance, no indie film,
no artful nudity.

01:18.180 --> 01:19.360
We have to fix this!

01:19.440 --> 01:20.820
The only thing nastier

01:20.900 --> 01:22.320
than a politician lying is when

01:22.400 --> 01:23.900
he says how he really feels.

01:23.980 --> 01:25.240
Now, there's no way
he'd tell the truth

01:25.310 --> 01:26.660
without a magical assist.

01:26.740 --> 01:28.070
I hope the Watergate
has vacancies,

01:28.150 --> 01:29.500
because we need to
make sure that

01:29.570 --> 01:31.410
Nixon still cheats the press.

01:31.480 --> 01:33.200
Uh, Captain's orders and all,
but do you think

01:33.280 --> 01:35.500
it's really the best time
to be back on mission?

01:35.580 --> 01:38.330
Yeah, I mean, it might
do well to take a beat.

01:38.340 --> 01:41.010
I appreciate your concern,
but I'll be fine.

01:41.090 --> 01:43.680
Just because Ava and I
had a disagreement

01:43.760 --> 01:45.350
doesn't mean that
I can't do my job.

01:45.420 --> 01:47.260
I was actually
talking about the fact that

01:47.330 --> 01:49.010
we're on the outs
with the Time Bureau.

01:49.020 --> 01:50.760
Yeah, and I was
talking about Mona.

01:50.840 --> 01:52.510
I mean, Hank's gonna be
after us since her boyfriend

01:52.520 --> 01:54.310
offed that agent and, well,

01:54.380 --> 01:56.430
we can't just
stash her here forever.

01:56.510 --> 02:00.270
Right, well,
it has been eventful

02:00.350 --> 02:02.360
but things are gonna
blow over with The Bureau.

02:02.370 --> 02:04.070
We'll find a safe place
for Mona.

02:04.140 --> 02:05.610
And in the meantime,

02:05.690 --> 02:09.199
I feel like we should
be doing what we do best.

02:09.280 --> 02:11.030
Am I right?
Right.

02:11.110 --> 02:14.160
Save Redford
and independent film.

02:14.240 --> 02:16.540
That's the spirit.

02:16.610 --> 02:18.000
- Done it for worse reasons.
- Why not?

02:18.780 --> 02:21.869

02:23.520 --> 02:24.780
Director Sharpe.

02:24.850 --> 02:26.450
You look terrible.
What happened?

02:26.520 --> 02:28.620
Joke acknowledged, Nathaniel,
but tighten up.

02:28.690 --> 02:31.490
Director Sharpe is taking a leave of
absence to get her priorities straight.

02:31.570 --> 02:33.870
I'll be acting as
Director of the Bureau.

02:33.880 --> 02:36.330
Wait, so, um, you're gonna be
in charge from now on? That's...

02:36.410 --> 02:37.480
- Great.
- It's great.

02:37.481 --> 02:39.133
Looking forward to working
with you, Director Heywood.

02:39.135 --> 02:41.000
Glad to have you on board,
Agent Tomaz.

02:41.080 --> 02:43.960
Though my first job
is a sensitive one.

02:44.040 --> 02:45.920
I need to catch the Legends.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.470
This is the last time they will
thumb their nose at authority

02:48.540 --> 02:50.180
and get away with it.

02:50.260 --> 02:51.900
I know they're your friends,

02:51.970 --> 02:53.570
so, if you want to
sit this one out...

02:53.640 --> 02:54.970
No, no, Dad.
You know what?

02:55.050 --> 02:56.560
We have your back.
Agreed.

02:56.570 --> 02:58.570
I stand by the Time Bureau
and by my man.

02:58.650 --> 03:01.690
- Thank you, babe.
- Glad to hear it.

03:01.770 --> 03:03.690
We'll pinpoint
the location of the Waverider

03:03.770 --> 03:05.360
and pay it a visit.

03:05.440 --> 03:08.070
We'll meet in
the situation room, 0900.

03:08.080 --> 03:10.110
Yes, sir.
Copy that.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.030
We need to expose
what Hank's up to

03:12.110 --> 03:13.830
before he drops a hammer
on the Legends.

03:13.900 --> 03:15.870
Did... did you just
call me "babe"?

03:15.950 --> 03:17.160
Well, yeah, I was riffing.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.580
I was trying to keep
this thing afloat.

03:18.590 --> 03:19.930
Anyways, now that

03:20.000 --> 03:21.760
we are stuck with Hank,

03:21.840 --> 03:24.050
we can't go through
his phone ourselves.

03:24.120 --> 03:28.340
With Ava gone, there's no one
here left to trust.

03:28.420 --> 03:31.270
Well, there's one person
we can trust.

03:34.520 --> 03:36.770
Gary, we need to talk.

03:36.780 --> 03:38.740
Is this about what happened
between Sara and Ava?

03:38.810 --> 03:40.950
Wait, you're working
at The Bureau?

03:41.020 --> 03:43.280
Yes, and...

03:43.360 --> 03:45.110
I need you to do
something for me.

03:45.120 --> 03:47.070
And you're my boss,

03:47.150 --> 03:48.530
which is great, you know,

03:48.600 --> 03:49.960
I'm happy for you.
No one deserves it more.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.290
Damn it, Gary.
Focus.

03:52.370 --> 03:54.620
Hank is causing
total chaos here.

03:54.630 --> 03:56.910
Did you notice him using
Director Sharpe's mug, too?

03:56.990 --> 03:58.370
You know,
I was gonna say something.

03:58.450 --> 04:00.130
It goes much deeper than that.

04:00.210 --> 04:01.630
Mona was right.

04:01.710 --> 04:03.710
Hank is running
some secret project.

04:03.790 --> 04:05.210
And now that he's
in charge of The Bureau,

04:05.290 --> 04:07.380
he's trying to
shut down the Legends.

04:07.460 --> 04:09.050
Nate and I cloned his phone.
We're gonna keep him busy.

04:09.130 --> 04:10.520
You need to
go through his activity,

04:10.590 --> 04:11.630
find out what
he's been up to, so we can

04:11.710 --> 04:13.470
end his time at The Bureau.

04:13.480 --> 04:16.390
Use this to stay in touch
without being monitored, okay?

04:16.470 --> 04:19.390
I've always wanted to
untangle a conspiracy.

04:19.470 --> 04:21.320
I'll need a bulletin board,
index cards.

04:21.399 --> 04:22.990
I already have yarn.
I've been getting into crochet.

04:23.060 --> 04:25.650
- Yeah, me too.
- We should start a club.

04:25.730 --> 04:27.650
We'll talk.

04:27.660 --> 04:29.110
Okay.

04:35.490 --> 04:36.580
<i>Konane, no!</i>

04:38.000 --> 04:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:48.920 --> 04:50.510
Grr.

04:50.520 --> 04:51.510
<i>Kid.</i>

04:51.580 --> 04:53.760
<i>You okay in there?</i>

04:56.090 --> 05:00.930
Sorry, I, uh, never used
a future tech toilet before.

05:01.010 --> 05:04.270
So many buttons.
Mm.

05:04.350 --> 05:07.480
Give it time.
You'll learn to live with it.

05:07.560 --> 05:10.200
Oh, uh, don't touch
the red button.

05:11.620 --> 05:14.040
Oh, uh, Captain,
I wanted to talk to you.

05:14.120 --> 05:15.920
Good.
I need to talk to you, too.

05:15.990 --> 05:17.870
So as far as The Bureau's
concerned, you're a fugitive.

05:17.880 --> 05:20.040
I need you to stay on the ship
and not draw any attention.

05:20.050 --> 05:23.380
It's not just that.
Um, when we were in Mexico...

05:23.460 --> 05:26.330
No, when we were in Mexico,
a man got murdered by Konane

05:26.410 --> 05:27.790
because you said
we could trust him.

05:27.870 --> 05:31.220
No, Konane didn't...

05:31.300 --> 05:33.590
He didn't mean to.

05:33.670 --> 05:35.730
Look, Mona, whatever it is,
it's in the past.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.060
Now it's on to the next problem.
That's how this works.

05:38.140 --> 05:39.470
Mick, Nixon's supposed to give

05:39.480 --> 05:41.060
his "I'm not a crook"
speech tomorrow.

05:41.130 --> 05:42.900
We need him back to
his lying self by then.

05:42.980 --> 05:44.900
You and John stay on the ship,
look after Mona,

05:44.980 --> 05:46.520
make sure she doesn't
get into any trouble.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.520
Make sure she doesn't
touch that red button.

05:54.060 --> 05:56.080
I'm telling you, I'm not crazy.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.320
In fact, I've never
felt better in my life.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.160
That's the truth.

06:00.240 --> 06:02.250
Here that?
The truth.

06:02.330 --> 06:04.660
Something is very wrong
with the President.

06:04.740 --> 06:07.210
And he's supposed to be at
Disney's contemporary hotel

06:07.290 --> 06:09.210
to address the entire
American press corps tomorrow.

06:09.290 --> 06:12.170
We'll, uh,
we'll take care of it.

06:12.250 --> 06:13.840
- I'll update the VP.
- All right, sir.

06:13.920 --> 06:16.270
We'll, uh, start off
with a little sedative.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.600
Ugh.

06:20.610 --> 06:23.100
Don't know why you lot
are relying on my powers.

06:23.110 --> 06:24.680
They're still all mucked up.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.190
Look, it'll be fine.

06:26.260 --> 06:27.610
We'll get him to the ship,
fix what's wrong,

06:27.690 --> 06:29.400
and we'll be right back.

06:29.410 --> 06:32.480
Now, let's see
your Nixon impression.

06:40.030 --> 06:41.450
Nice.

06:44.710 --> 06:45.710
We got the cargo.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.250
<i>We're on our way.</i>

06:47.330 --> 06:48.630
Well, let's figure out
what loosed his tongue

06:48.710 --> 06:49.970
and get the hell out of here,
shall we?

06:53.290 --> 06:54.630
Listen, you guys can't be here.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.310
The Bureau's onto you.
Ah, good.

06:56.380 --> 06:58.510
Time for a pig roast.
No one's roasting anyone.

06:58.590 --> 07:00.800
And it's not just The Bureau.
It's my dad and he's got backup.

07:00.810 --> 07:02.310
Go.
No, not again.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.860
Guys, we're working on
stopping Hank for good.

07:03.930 --> 07:05.140
In the meantime, you need to

07:05.150 --> 07:06.150
find the team
and stay ahead of him.

07:06.230 --> 07:07.560
On it.

07:13.160 --> 07:14.480
What's going on?

07:14.560 --> 07:15.870
Nate's old man
commandeered the ship.

07:15.950 --> 07:17.110
There they are!

07:17.190 --> 07:18.150
All units,
converge on my position.

07:18.230 --> 07:19.490
Okay, take the stairs.

07:19.500 --> 07:22.130
Get Nixon.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.580
<i>Ignis-sa.</i>

07:25.200 --> 07:27.160
Ow!

07:27.170 --> 07:29.170
<i>We have eyes on the Legends
and they have the President!</i>

07:29.250 --> 07:31.750
They've gone too far, again!

07:31.830 --> 07:34.000
Siri... what, uh, Alexa...

07:34.080 --> 07:36.260
Gideon!
Fire up the engine.

07:39.790 --> 07:42.300
Legends must have
bricked the ship.

07:42.380 --> 07:44.680
Oh, they think of everything.

07:48.030 --> 07:49.810
Nicely done.

07:49.890 --> 07:52.100
I want our men
watching every time jump,

07:52.180 --> 07:53.770
listening to every comm.

07:53.850 --> 07:55.270
How are we going to make
distance with five of us

07:55.350 --> 07:56.440
and a kidnapped Nixon?

07:56.520 --> 08:00.030
There.
There's our getaway.

08:00.040 --> 08:01.370
That's a bit on the nose, no?

08:01.450 --> 08:03.160
We left subtlety back in Mexico.

08:03.230 --> 08:04.780
Gotta go.

08:12.980 --> 08:14.310
<i>The Legends are
in the wind, Director.</i>

08:14.390 --> 08:14.977
Damn it!

08:15.002 --> 08:17.220
<i>They must have stolen a
vehicle and hit the road.</i>

08:17.889 --> 08:18.355
You know what?

08:18.865 --> 08:22.705
I've never needed a Waverider
before and I don't need one now.

08:23.035 --> 08:23.985
You give me a dragnet.

08:24.065 --> 08:25.445
I want agents at every

08:25.455 --> 08:27.905
rest stop, diner,
store along the highway.

08:27.985 --> 08:29.325
Move.

08:29.335 --> 08:31.165
And you, set up
a police scanner.

08:31.235 --> 08:33.794
If the Legends
so much as forget to signal,

08:33.875 --> 08:35.755
we'll hear about it.

08:35.825 --> 08:37.375
They'll slip up eventually.

08:37.455 --> 08:39.475
That's probably accurate.

08:47.885 --> 08:50.645
Okay.

08:50.725 --> 08:53.485
Captain, you should know that

08:53.565 --> 08:56.475
me and tight spaces
might not mix.

08:56.495 --> 08:59.155
Do you think any of us
want to be stuck in the RV?

08:59.235 --> 09:00.995
Punch buggy.
No punch backs.

09:01.065 --> 09:03.985
Mona, the team's back
is up against the wall.

09:04.065 --> 09:05.615
And right now,
you are a part of this team.

09:05.695 --> 09:06.655
And if you want it to
stay that way,

09:06.665 --> 09:07.655
then you need to help,

09:07.665 --> 09:08.655
not create more problems.

09:08.665 --> 09:11.005
- Okay.
- Great.

09:13.495 --> 09:15.005
<i>Bob is struck with</i>

09:15.085 --> 09:17.415
<i>appendicitis on
an all-new "The Waltons."</i>

09:17.495 --> 09:19.515
<i>For all you lonely hearts
on the road today</i>

09:19.585 --> 09:22.135
<i>here's a tune just for you.</i>

09:22.205 --> 09:26.505
You know, I've never been
in a car that's a room before.

09:29.005 --> 09:30.635
Patricia.

09:30.715 --> 09:35.225
No, I'm not Patricia, Dick.

09:35.235 --> 09:37.365
Ooh.
Camera.

09:37.435 --> 09:39.365
Not to bother you,
but we've lost the ship,

09:39.445 --> 09:41.775
drugged the President, and
I'm stuck in the back with her.

09:41.855 --> 09:44.235
Now what are we gonna do?
We are going to Disney World.

09:44.315 --> 09:46.705
Yawn. Haven't we
been tortured enough?

09:46.785 --> 09:49.495
I mean, we are going to
fix Nixon

09:49.565 --> 09:51.875
in time to get him to
Florida to lie his ass off.

09:51.955 --> 09:53.545
We are not gonna let
anything stop us

09:53.625 --> 09:54.995
from what we set out to do.

09:55.075 --> 09:56.745
Mick, watch our tail.

09:56.825 --> 09:58.875
John, see if you can figure out
what's wrong with Nixon.

09:58.885 --> 10:00.545
And Mona, find us
something to wear.

10:00.555 --> 10:02.875
Charlie...

10:02.955 --> 10:04.635
We forgot Charlie!

10:04.705 --> 10:06.295
Oh, "We'll be right back,"
they said.

10:06.375 --> 10:08.675
Yeah, bloody right.

10:08.755 --> 10:10.395
<i>Mr. President?</i>

10:10.475 --> 10:12.305
- Oh, no, no, no. Okay.
<i>- Mr. President?</i>

10:12.385 --> 10:14.395
Uh, quick, quick, quick,
Charlie.

10:14.405 --> 10:16.515
<i>Mr. President,
are you okay in there?</i>

10:19.905 --> 10:21.695
Just checking in, Mr. President.

10:23.765 --> 10:25.245
You check in again,

10:25.325 --> 10:28.575
you'll be lucky to be
guarding a shopping mall.

10:39.505 --> 10:42.375
Um, okay, make your next left.

10:42.455 --> 10:44.425
Okay.

10:44.505 --> 10:46.895
No, your next right.

10:54.635 --> 10:56.225
Hey, guys?

10:56.305 --> 10:58.725
Looks like Nixon over there

10:58.805 --> 11:00.105
is finally winning
The War on Drugs.

11:04.695 --> 11:07.195
Good God, I've been
kidnapped by hippies.

11:07.275 --> 11:08.525
What is it you want?

11:08.605 --> 11:10.535
Money? Power?
I'll do anything.

11:10.605 --> 11:12.285
Look, we're...
We're here to help you.

11:12.295 --> 11:14.035
Let's talk about money.

11:14.115 --> 11:15.745
You know, right now
we're your best shot

11:15.825 --> 11:18.415
at getting back
to your right self.

11:18.495 --> 11:20.745
Oh, let's have a look.

11:20.825 --> 11:23.965
Now, I have my suspicions
as to what's got at ya.

11:23.975 --> 11:26.215
Yep, okay.

11:27.835 --> 11:30.885
<i>Vi veri universum vivus vici.</i>

11:30.965 --> 11:32.805
What the hell
are you babbling about?

11:38.965 --> 11:41.395
Oh!

11:41.475 --> 11:43.895
- It's a roach.
- I've been bugged.

11:43.975 --> 11:45.495
This is an agent of Ma'at,

11:45.565 --> 11:47.775
the Goddess of truth
in the Egyptian pantheon.

11:47.855 --> 11:50.325
You see, the creature,
it feeds off lies.

11:50.335 --> 11:53.865
And whoever it eats at has
nothing but truth left to tell.

11:53.945 --> 11:55.655
No wonder it found
its way to Nixon.

11:55.735 --> 11:57.575
You must have been a feast.

11:57.655 --> 11:58.925
No, no, no... oh.

11:58.995 --> 12:00.745
Sorry.

12:00.825 --> 12:02.415
Put him in the closet.

12:02.495 --> 12:04.005
Ugh.

12:04.015 --> 12:06.175
- Come on, Dicky.
- Yeah.

12:06.255 --> 12:08.925
Let's put Dick in a box.

12:08.995 --> 12:11.345
Okay.

12:11.355 --> 12:14.675
Um, Captain?
Can we talk?

12:14.685 --> 12:18.195
A lot's been going on and...

12:18.265 --> 12:21.565
And a truth roach, well,
that's gonna be a wrinkle.

12:21.645 --> 12:24.145
Look, Mona, I have a really
big responsibility for you.

12:24.225 --> 12:27.485
I need you to watch the roach.
Me? But, um...

12:27.555 --> 12:28.985
Your job was to
take care of creatures, right?

12:29.065 --> 12:31.275
Who better than you?

12:34.205 --> 12:38.665
Hey, little guy.
Bet you're hungry.

12:40.735 --> 12:42.705
Hank Heywood.

12:44.385 --> 12:46.415
Renewed his Bestflix
subscription...

12:46.425 --> 12:47.965
<i>December 16th...
Hank Heywood...</i>

12:48.035 --> 12:49.335
<i>November 27th...
Hank Heywood...</i>

12:52.465 --> 12:54.385
<i>So that means...</i>

12:58.475 --> 13:01.185
Oh, my God, how did this happen?

13:01.255 --> 13:03.695
I am way out of my league.

13:08.645 --> 13:10.075
What is it, Jerry?

13:10.155 --> 13:13.525
- No, it's... it's Gary.
- Hm.

13:13.605 --> 13:15.365
I notice you're reading "Body
of Proof" by Rebecca Silver.

13:15.445 --> 13:18.075
Is that a conspiracy thriller?
Book club's at capacity.

13:18.085 --> 13:22.425
Uh, no, no, that's not it.
It's, um...

13:22.495 --> 13:25.245
I need your help
uncovering a conspiracy.

13:25.255 --> 13:26.595
Why would I help you?

13:26.665 --> 13:28.455
Because you might be in trouble.

13:28.535 --> 13:29.845
Hank has his agents

13:29.925 --> 13:31.935
taking fugitives
out of their cells at night,

13:32.005 --> 13:34.175
and I don't want you to be next.

13:34.255 --> 13:38.885
So I thought if
I release you for the night,

13:38.965 --> 13:40.555
maybe you could help me?

13:43.765 --> 13:47.525
Hey, you okay?

13:47.595 --> 13:49.605
It's not easy
being trapped somewhere

13:49.615 --> 13:52.275
where no one
will listen to you, huh?

13:52.285 --> 13:54.455
Hey, can you hear me?

13:56.375 --> 13:59.335
You probably need air.

14:02.085 --> 14:03.625
Oh.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

14:03.695 --> 14:05.245
What's going on?

14:05.325 --> 14:08.045
Uh, oh, I just dropped it
but it's okay.

14:08.115 --> 14:09.255
It got it...

14:10.975 --> 14:12.805
What... what's wrong
with the brakes?

14:16.455 --> 14:17.425
Can't slow down!
Can't slow down!

14:20.815 --> 14:24.145
Move your... get...
Your foot, Ray.

14:24.215 --> 14:26.435
Got it.

14:27.655 --> 14:28.975
Who called the cops?

14:28.985 --> 14:30.195
Cops?

14:32.015 --> 14:33.655
I've never been
pulled over before.

14:33.665 --> 14:36.615
What do I do?
You just pull over.

14:41.855 --> 14:43.405
Okay.

14:43.485 --> 14:46.535
Just be cool.
You got this.

14:49.415 --> 14:52.385
Good afternoon...

14:52.465 --> 14:55.175
Good afternoon, officer.

14:55.185 --> 14:56.385
By the looks of your driving,

14:56.465 --> 14:57.845
you're having a fine afternoon.

14:57.925 --> 14:59.465
Ah.

14:59.545 --> 15:03.185
What is it?
Drinking? Drugs?

15:03.265 --> 15:05.435
No, sir, no, sir, no, sir,
we're just, uh...

15:05.505 --> 15:07.025
just driving and having a little

15:07.105 --> 15:09.355
steering wheel problems.

15:09.365 --> 15:11.025
Tell me some more about
this steering wheel trouble.

15:11.105 --> 15:12.855
Oh, well, it's a real doozy.

15:12.865 --> 15:15.535
So I'm here with my family
and we're on our way

15:15.615 --> 15:19.195
to North Carolina to see
the largest chest of drawers.

15:19.205 --> 15:23.045
- Ray.
- Uh, uh, so the steering wheel

15:23.115 --> 15:27.375
was a little loose and
so I turned to my wife,

15:27.455 --> 15:30.125
Claire, and, uh, I said...

15:35.075 --> 15:37.135
My friends and I here
are time travelers.

15:37.205 --> 15:38.295
We've kidnapped Nixon,

15:38.375 --> 15:42.005
and we're headed
to Disney World.

15:42.085 --> 15:44.385
Like I thought.

15:44.395 --> 15:46.235
You're high as
a Good Year blimp.

15:46.305 --> 15:48.145
I'm calling this in.

15:48.215 --> 15:49.685
Get this out of me.

15:49.765 --> 15:52.895
<i>Vi veri universum vivus vici.</i>

15:52.905 --> 15:55.945
Ugh.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.355
How'd it even...

15:58.435 --> 15:59.475
Mona!

15:59.485 --> 16:01.195
<i>I'm at exit 244.</i>

16:01.275 --> 16:03.905
<i>I've got an RV full of hopheads
who claim they're from the future.</i>

16:03.915 --> 16:06.405
See?
Come on, son.

16:06.485 --> 16:08.245
Let's go grab our guys
the old-fashioned way.

16:08.325 --> 16:10.495
- Mm-hmm.
- Wait, I...

16:10.575 --> 16:12.545
I tuned this to
a frequency Hank can't read.

16:12.625 --> 16:14.465
And I think I know a way
to contact the team.

16:14.545 --> 16:17.425
It's a little old-school
but it should work.

16:17.505 --> 16:18.885
I'll be in touch.

16:21.755 --> 16:23.215
I can't have
a ticket on my record.

16:23.295 --> 16:24.765
I can't have a ticket
on my record!

16:24.845 --> 16:25.885
Yeah, well,
nabbing Nixon's gonna give you

16:25.965 --> 16:27.095
more than a bloody ticket, mate.

16:27.105 --> 16:28.635
Gun it!
I'm bored.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.015
He's right.
Gun it.

16:30.095 --> 16:31.015
But then we'll become fugitives.

16:31.095 --> 16:32.195
We're already fugitives!

16:32.275 --> 16:33.725
Go!

16:33.735 --> 16:36.445
Hey!
Get... you come back here!

16:39.285 --> 16:42.065
Officer, we heard
your report from up high.

16:42.145 --> 16:43.275
Where are the offenders?

16:43.355 --> 16:45.115
Uh, I was fixing to call it in.

16:45.125 --> 16:47.365
You let them get away?

16:47.445 --> 16:48.585
You're gonna have to find
another way home

16:48.665 --> 16:50.285
because that's my car now.

16:52.825 --> 16:56.165
There's a new sheriff in town.

16:56.245 --> 16:58.425
Let's ride.

17:01.955 --> 17:04.365
Nice moves, Palmer.

17:04.444 --> 17:06.954
They're gaining.

17:07.035 --> 17:10.214
Yeah, and I don't think
that's the cops on us, mate.

17:12.555 --> 17:16.175
Whoa, hey! This car has no
airbags or traction control.

17:16.244 --> 17:20.214
Exactly.
Nothing but pure V8 power.

17:20.224 --> 17:21.895
WhoaK.

17:23.545 --> 17:24.685
We gotta lose Hank.

17:24.694 --> 17:26.185
You got something
for this, John?

17:26.255 --> 17:27.234
I might, but I'll need you
to get us

17:27.315 --> 17:29.155
off the road quick, squire.

17:34.075 --> 17:36.525
<i>Absconditus Domus.</i>

17:54.205 --> 17:56.005
Where the hell did they go?

17:59.005 --> 18:00.685
<i>Nothing to see here.</i>

18:00.765 --> 18:02.885
What was with the radio?

18:02.965 --> 18:05.765
<i>The heat's heavy on
the highway tonight</i>

18:05.775 --> 18:08.105
<i>and that's no weather report.</i>

18:08.185 --> 18:10.435
<i>Lucky for you, you're not alone,</i>

18:10.445 --> 18:14.565
<i>because you got DJ Z to guide
you past those bad vibes.</i>

18:14.645 --> 18:16.695
DJ Z?
That sounds like Zari.

18:16.765 --> 18:19.615
Right now, the beat
on the street is to lay low.

18:19.695 --> 18:23.035
But while you park it,
here's a hit to keep you safe.

18:23.105 --> 18:26.365
All right, you heard her.
We should keep a low profile.

18:26.445 --> 18:28.295
If we leave by night,
we should be able to make it.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.705
In the meantime,
no drawing attention

18:30.785 --> 18:32.375
and no altering the timeline.

18:32.455 --> 18:34.635
Well, we best keep
that bug bottled then, aye?

18:34.715 --> 18:36.085
The only way to
keep it contained is for

18:36.165 --> 18:38.805
everyone to
stay completely honest.

18:40.625 --> 18:42.805
What the hell is going on here?

18:44.265 --> 18:46.135
Checkers.

18:48.315 --> 18:50.895
Maybe it's best
if we all just don't talk.

18:52.805 --> 18:56.145
Now we just enter
a command line to a mirror site

18:56.155 --> 18:58.535
and we can get into his email.

18:58.615 --> 19:00.615
This email is linked
to a private server.

19:00.685 --> 19:02.825
Must be where he's got his dirt.

19:02.835 --> 19:04.995
We need a password.

19:05.075 --> 19:07.995
Uh, or, we can reset it.

19:08.005 --> 19:09.665
I forget my passwords
all the time.

19:09.745 --> 19:12.005
Those memory flashers
have a lot of side effects.

19:12.085 --> 19:13.505
Password reset question.

19:13.585 --> 19:17.295
Uh, we'll need some
personal info from Hank.

19:19.875 --> 19:23.295
What's the word?
Uh, sorry Gary.

19:23.375 --> 19:25.845
<i>What's the word?</i>
I need some scoop on Hank.

19:25.855 --> 19:27.975
Stand by, Gary.

19:27.985 --> 19:29.095
<i>Hey, Nate, we
need to know the name of</i>

19:29.175 --> 19:30.855
<i>your dad's childhood pet.</i>

19:30.935 --> 19:33.015
<i>And whatever you do,
keep your dad off the FM.</i>

19:33.025 --> 19:35.815
I'm on it, Z.

19:40.445 --> 19:43.155
Huh.
That's a pretty cool trick.

19:43.225 --> 19:45.785
You, uh, drink a lot of Cokes
when you were a kid?

19:45.855 --> 19:47.545
Yeah.

19:47.615 --> 19:49.875
My mom used to give me
a quarter for the corner store,

19:49.955 --> 19:51.455
<i>let me pick out
whatever I wanted.</i>

19:51.525 --> 19:52.705
With her raising me
on her own, a quarter

19:52.785 --> 19:54.245
was more than I even knew.

19:54.325 --> 19:57.545
You don't really talk
about your childhood much.

19:57.555 --> 19:59.625
Like, I'm not sure
I know where you were born.

19:59.705 --> 20:02.715
Hackensack, in New Jersey.

20:02.725 --> 20:04.225
Like the Billy Joel song.

20:04.305 --> 20:05.675
We should turn on the radio.

20:05.755 --> 20:07.515
1973, great year for music.

20:07.585 --> 20:10.175
Actually, why don't we...
Why don't we talk?

20:10.195 --> 20:12.975
You know,
get to know each other.

20:14.575 --> 20:16.405
You're right, Nathaniel.

20:16.475 --> 20:19.145
You could call me Nate.

20:19.225 --> 20:20.865
Did you have a dog?

20:20.945 --> 20:22.565
A lab.

20:22.645 --> 20:24.575
Yeah, named him Silver.

20:24.655 --> 20:27.655
After the...
Lone Ranger's horse. Yes.

20:27.735 --> 20:29.365
Yes, yes, yes.

20:29.445 --> 20:32.665
You used to show me
old episodes.

20:32.675 --> 20:36.495
Well, at least
I taught you something.

20:36.575 --> 20:38.585
Huh?

20:45.675 --> 20:47.385
You know, my mom used to
take me on road trips,

20:47.465 --> 20:49.175
stop for ice cream.

20:49.255 --> 20:53.605
Without Dad around, she
really had to play both roles.

20:53.685 --> 20:56.435
She didn't know how
to be a father,

20:56.445 --> 21:01.435
but she did her best.

21:01.455 --> 21:05.785
Guess I could say
the same for myself.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.775
Um.

21:07.785 --> 21:11.745
It's nice we get to make up
for some lost time, hmm?

21:11.815 --> 21:13.955
But, uh, we should
get back to the ship,

21:13.965 --> 21:15.205
see if Zari's back online.

21:15.275 --> 21:16.465
Actually, um,

21:16.535 --> 21:17.795
why don't we forget the Legends

21:17.875 --> 21:20.705
for a minute and
go get some ice cream?

21:20.785 --> 21:24.215
Fine idea, Nathaniel.

21:24.285 --> 21:26.545
Nate.

21:26.625 --> 21:28.765
<i>Hey, Gary?
The answer is Silver.</i>

21:31.815 --> 21:34.935
Silver.
I'm in!

21:35.005 --> 21:37.395
Hackers do
say that in real life.

21:37.465 --> 21:39.475
What is this?

21:39.485 --> 21:43.315
Property deed
in Hank's name from 1912?

21:43.325 --> 21:47.735
What's this shipment for
dwarf star alloy from 1837?

21:47.815 --> 21:50.665
He's using time travel
for personal gain?

21:50.745 --> 21:52.745
That is against Bureau creed.

21:52.815 --> 21:54.155
I have a copy in my wallet.

21:54.235 --> 21:57.175
Shh-shh.
Someone's coming.

22:43.125 --> 22:46.215
Who was that?

22:46.295 --> 22:48.885
Are you okay?

22:48.965 --> 22:52.465
You have to take this
to Zari and stop digging.

22:52.545 --> 22:54.885
I'll go back to my cell.

22:54.895 --> 22:58.065
And, Gary, be careful.

23:11.985 --> 23:13.525
I got an alert that someone

23:13.545 --> 23:15.745
recovered your password
from the Time Bureau

23:15.825 --> 23:17.405
and they're accessing
your accounts.

23:17.415 --> 23:19.365
But who would...

23:19.445 --> 23:22.165
How would they even...

23:22.245 --> 23:23.585
Thanks.

23:25.285 --> 23:28.975
It won't happen again.

23:31.265 --> 23:33.255
You know, I was just
thinking that even though

23:33.265 --> 23:36.435
we've had some setbacks,
that this road trip

23:36.515 --> 23:38.275
has really been
a great bonding experience.

23:38.345 --> 23:40.845
I think you're an idiot.

23:43.055 --> 23:44.815
Well, look,
we've dealt with a lot lately,

23:44.885 --> 23:49.615
and I think this is a very
needed chance for us to sit

23:49.695 --> 23:51.105
and really talk
about how we feel.

23:51.185 --> 23:52.615
Well, I'm glad you're happy.

23:52.625 --> 23:54.075
No, wait, I mean...

23:55.485 --> 23:57.245
I don't give a damn
if you're happy.

23:57.315 --> 23:59.005
And I certainly don't trust
you lot in helping me face Neron

23:59.075 --> 24:01.295
no matter how many
"go team" pep talks you give.

24:01.375 --> 24:03.455
Well, you can't keep me down!

24:04.945 --> 24:06.845
Actually, ever since I met you,

24:06.915 --> 24:09.125
I sometimes lie awake at night

24:09.135 --> 24:12.755
staring into the dark thinking
I am it, and it is me.

24:12.835 --> 24:14.595
Also, I don't think
Han shot first.

24:14.605 --> 24:16.555
- I'm gonna go sit up front.
- Also I used the strategy guide

24:16.635 --> 24:18.215
to beat the Water Temple
in "Legend of Zelda."

24:18.295 --> 24:19.925
Also, I really like gluten.

24:20.005 --> 24:21.435
Well, I think it's a cool look,

24:21.505 --> 24:23.555
but the whole loosened tie
is a little try hard.

24:23.635 --> 24:24.775
Yeah, well, you know,
it's not like

24:24.855 --> 24:25.935
I went and loosened it myself.

24:28.065 --> 24:29.935
Yeah, well, at least
I don't go make up my own

24:29.955 --> 24:32.275
silly superhero names
like "Atom" and "Heat Wave".

24:32.355 --> 24:33.495
Like I care what you think.

24:35.835 --> 24:38.405
I want to grow my hair out
and look like Fabio.

24:38.485 --> 24:39.995
Yeah, that...
I think that would be good.

24:41.485 --> 24:44.325
So honestly,
even as much as I trust Sara,

24:44.335 --> 24:46.285
this has been
one disaster after another

24:46.365 --> 24:50.005
and I really think that this
time we are totally screwed.

24:50.015 --> 24:52.125
Captain, we're okay, right?

24:52.205 --> 24:54.755
I mean, we just have to
focus on the mission.

24:54.835 --> 24:57.135
Yeah, Mona.
We're gonna be fine.

25:02.765 --> 25:04.475
Ah!

25:04.555 --> 25:08.315
Of course we're not fine, Mona.
Nothing is fine.

25:08.385 --> 25:10.475
And I am definitely not fine.

25:10.555 --> 25:12.775
Ava and I didn't just get into
an argument.

25:12.855 --> 25:14.275
She asked me to leave.

25:14.355 --> 25:16.315
And she hasn't answered
any of my calls since.

25:16.395 --> 25:19.325
And she was my one chance,
my one chance, Mona,

25:19.395 --> 25:20.705
at something real.

25:20.785 --> 25:22.705
And now I don't have a ship.

25:22.785 --> 25:24.035
I don't have a girlfriend.

25:24.045 --> 25:26.285
And I am the Captain of an RV

25:26.365 --> 25:28.885
and it is all your fault!

25:30.575 --> 25:32.505
Well, I won't be
your problem anymore.

25:40.795 --> 25:42.065
Mona!

25:42.135 --> 25:43.895
Mona, wait!

25:43.975 --> 25:45.805
Mona, come back!

25:51.785 --> 25:53.405
Mona, come back!

25:53.635 --> 25:55.885
Look, I meant everything I said

25:55.895 --> 26:00.645
but if you stay here in 1973,
you'll never survive!

26:00.715 --> 26:03.815
John, get this thing out of me.

26:03.885 --> 26:06.905
<i>Vi veri universum vivus vici.</i>

26:06.985 --> 26:08.985
Ugh.

26:09.055 --> 26:11.235
All right.
You guys, get Nixon to Florida.

26:11.245 --> 26:12.815
If you leave now,
there'll be time to spare.

26:12.895 --> 26:13.785
What about you?

26:13.865 --> 26:15.235
Mona's out there alone

26:15.245 --> 26:16.865
and we don't
leave our people behind

26:16.945 --> 26:18.495
no matter how much
they bug the crap out of us.

26:18.565 --> 26:21.875
I'd say no pun intended,
but that would be a lie.

26:21.945 --> 26:23.425
Hey, mate.
Hold that.

26:23.495 --> 26:24.925
What?
What, where are you going?

26:25.005 --> 26:26.625
Oh, I just need to
stretch my legs, squire.

26:33.265 --> 26:34.435
You all right, Dad?

26:34.505 --> 26:37.215
You didn't finish
your ice cream.

26:37.295 --> 26:39.435
Put on your seat belt.

26:39.515 --> 26:41.385
What's the hurry?

26:41.465 --> 26:44.395
The Legend's RV was spotted
just outside Richmond.

26:44.465 --> 26:46.605
My men are
setting up a blockade.

26:46.615 --> 26:48.565
They won't get away this time.

26:48.645 --> 26:51.855
That's great.
That's great!

26:51.935 --> 26:54.945
Whoo!

26:54.955 --> 26:56.285
You know,
this is what I dreamed about

26:56.365 --> 26:57.445
when I joined The Bureau.

26:57.455 --> 26:59.445
Stealing a cop car?

26:59.465 --> 27:01.615
You and me working together.

27:06.615 --> 27:08.875
Uh, yeah.
Oh.

27:08.955 --> 27:10.465
Ooh, you know what?

27:10.545 --> 27:12.925
Ooh, dad, that ice cream
is not agreeing with me.

27:12.995 --> 27:16.215
Can you, uh...
can you pull over?

27:31.905 --> 27:33.985
<i>Z?
Z, can you hear me?</i>

27:33.995 --> 27:35.325
Nate, is that you?

27:35.405 --> 27:37.275
Listen,
I need you to warn the team.

27:37.355 --> 27:39.335
Hank's got a blockade on
the highway north of Richmond.

27:39.405 --> 27:40.835
They got to find another route.

27:40.905 --> 27:42.865
<i>You got it?</i>
Roger. Over and out.

27:44.995 --> 27:47.175
There you go, hon.

27:57.705 --> 27:59.505
All right, what do you want?

27:59.525 --> 28:02.025
- Whatever's fast and cheap.
- No, no, please no.

28:02.095 --> 28:06.735
Can I get six Daphne House
burgers and a round of sodas?

28:06.815 --> 28:08.015
Coming up.

28:12.605 --> 28:15.815
Sara, hold up.
Hey!

28:15.895 --> 28:17.865
How do you even know
where she went, aye?

28:17.945 --> 28:20.785
Bike treads went this way.
We passed a diner a while back.

28:20.855 --> 28:23.585
She's probably headed there.
Hm.

28:23.665 --> 28:25.215
Go ahead.

28:25.285 --> 28:27.325
I know you've been dying
to say I told you so,

28:27.405 --> 28:29.205
so just do it.

28:29.215 --> 28:30.795
Uh, it's quite
the opposite, actually.

28:30.865 --> 28:33.625
It's... I wanted to see
how you're holding up.

28:33.635 --> 28:36.925
Honestly I'm freaking out.

28:36.995 --> 28:38.725
With the Kaupe dead
and Mona in the wind

28:38.805 --> 28:40.885
and then there's Ava and...

28:40.895 --> 28:43.215
What happened?

28:43.235 --> 28:46.135
I... I went to go talk to her
and...

28:46.215 --> 28:47.735
And I thought everything was
going to be fine

28:47.805 --> 28:51.645
'cause it's always fine
and it was bad, John.

28:51.725 --> 28:55.075
Look, I just... I don't know how
to convince everybody

28:55.155 --> 28:59.115
that everything's okay
when I'm not okay.

28:59.185 --> 29:01.025
Well, you know, if we were in
each other's shoes right now

29:01.105 --> 29:03.655
then you'd be giving me
some rubbish speech about

29:03.735 --> 29:05.705
about how you don't have to
shoulder the burden myself

29:05.775 --> 29:08.165
when I have friends around me
to help me carry it.

29:08.235 --> 29:09.745
Not that I believe you
for a second,

29:09.755 --> 29:14.005
but that doesn't mean
it's not true.

29:14.075 --> 29:17.545
Thanks, even if you're just
lying to make me feel better.

29:17.625 --> 29:20.265
Oh, I definitely am.
Hope it worked, though.

29:27.445 --> 29:29.445
You all right there?

29:29.515 --> 29:32.365
Uh, yeah.
I'm... I'm great.

29:34.805 --> 29:37.115
- Let's grab some tunes.
- Oh, no, no.

29:37.195 --> 29:39.905
Hey.

29:39.975 --> 29:42.075
<i>I just got a white hot tip.</i>

29:42.145 --> 29:43.785
The voice sounds familiar.

29:43.795 --> 29:46.245
I don't recognize her... or him.
I... I don't hear gender.

29:46.315 --> 29:48.955
<i>There's a smoky
checkpoint outside Richmond.</i>

29:48.965 --> 29:50.955
<i>If you want to make it
to your final destination,</i>

29:51.035 --> 29:52.745
<i>do yourself a favor and take</i>

29:52.825 --> 29:55.705
<i>route 301
all the way home, bandit.</i>

29:55.785 --> 29:57.125
Sounds like
we're taking a detour.

30:00.295 --> 30:05.215
Dad, dad, dad, dad!

30:05.295 --> 30:06.845
Are you insane?
You could have got us killed!

30:06.925 --> 30:08.565
Ha!
You're still here, ain't you?

30:08.645 --> 30:10.095
Yeah, but we're
going the wrong way.

30:10.175 --> 30:12.055
Nope, we're right on target.

30:12.135 --> 30:14.725
All units, Legends
are headed down route 301.

30:14.805 --> 30:17.935
Reroute all units to converge
on their location now.

30:18.015 --> 30:19.895
Come on, I'm not gonna miss
a chance to get back

30:19.975 --> 30:21.325
at the Legends for Mexico.

30:21.405 --> 30:22.825
They're gonna get
what they deserve

30:22.905 --> 30:24.445
for trying to protect
that wolf bastard.

30:24.525 --> 30:27.745
- His name was Konane.
- What?

30:30.365 --> 30:34.335
Wait, I remember you.

30:34.415 --> 30:36.835
You're the one
Director Heywood fired.

30:36.845 --> 30:38.455
You're the reason
that mutt got out

30:38.535 --> 30:40.625
of the containment
facility in the first place.

30:40.705 --> 30:42.795
I said, his name was

30:42.875 --> 30:44.465
Konane.

30:59.205 --> 31:02.055
There's Mona's bike.
Where is she?

31:02.125 --> 31:03.625
Where is everybody?

31:03.705 --> 31:05.675
Yeah, I know this kind of quiet

31:05.745 --> 31:07.005
and it never means
anything good.

31:09.585 --> 31:11.385
Everybody out!

31:22.055 --> 31:23.575
- Mona.
- I'll do it.

31:23.655 --> 31:25.235
I'll shoot!

31:25.245 --> 31:26.865
The Kaupe
must have scratched her.

31:26.935 --> 31:29.405
Oh, she tried to tell me,

31:29.415 --> 31:31.035
and I didn't listen.

31:37.905 --> 31:39.535
Mona, put him down!

31:39.615 --> 31:41.835
Come on, love, this isn't you.

31:48.755 --> 31:49.925
Stop the RV!

31:49.935 --> 31:51.435
Step out of the vehicle!

31:55.965 --> 31:58.185
What are we gonna do?
We can't drive through them.

31:58.265 --> 31:59.765
- Kill 'em. Kill 'em all.
- What? No.

31:59.845 --> 32:00.855
- Yes.
- No!

32:00.925 --> 32:01.905
- Yes!
- No.

32:01.985 --> 32:03.145
- Yes.
- N...

32:03.225 --> 32:05.105
Oh, Nate's here.

32:05.115 --> 32:06.945
I'm sure we can
talk this all out.

32:09.605 --> 32:11.115
Do you want to
do the honors, Son?

32:11.125 --> 32:13.785
Damn right, Dad.
All right!

32:13.795 --> 32:15.455
Don't worry, buddy.
I'll get you out of this.

32:17.985 --> 32:20.955
Mr. Heywood, if we could
just talk about this,

32:20.965 --> 32:23.085
I'm sure we can explain
and show you

32:23.165 --> 32:24.965
how this is just
one big misunderstanding.

32:24.975 --> 32:28.465
How's that for
a misunderstanding, you pig?

32:28.545 --> 32:31.215
By the power vested to me by
the United States government,

32:31.295 --> 32:32.885
I hereby arrest both of you

32:32.965 --> 32:35.555
on five charges of treason,
two of conspiracy...

32:35.635 --> 32:38.765
Uh, sir?

32:38.775 --> 32:40.815
Mr. President?
Are you all right?

32:40.895 --> 32:41.975
No!

32:41.985 --> 32:42.985
These two men and their

32:43.065 --> 32:44.825
co-conspirators kidnapped me.

32:44.895 --> 32:46.815
They've besmirched my good name

32:46.895 --> 32:48.075
and I've done nothing
to deserve it.

32:48.155 --> 32:49.405
Uhoh.

32:55.195 --> 32:58.705
Well, actually, there is
nothing good about my name.

32:58.715 --> 33:01.745
If you were born with
the name Dick Millhouse,

33:01.825 --> 33:05.345
you'd grow up
to be a bastard, too.

33:05.415 --> 33:07.795
- Ha-ha.
- What the hell?

33:07.875 --> 33:09.585
Listen to me, Mona.

33:09.665 --> 33:11.505
No one else needs to get hurt.

33:11.515 --> 33:12.895
<i>Funis Captis.</i>

33:14.525 --> 33:16.265
I am sorry about that, love.

33:16.335 --> 33:18.145
Bloody hell.

33:20.175 --> 33:22.145
Mona, can you hear me?

33:23.725 --> 33:25.185
Come on, I know you're in there.

33:25.195 --> 33:26.695
It's me.
It's Sara.

33:26.775 --> 33:30.035
I told you, Sara,
I remember everything.

33:30.115 --> 33:32.775
You pretended to be a friend!

33:35.205 --> 33:38.655
I looked up to you!
Mona.

33:39.755 --> 33:42.835
It was all lies.

33:45.575 --> 33:47.335
Mr. President,
what is going on?

33:47.415 --> 33:49.835
I don't know, but
I'm supposed to be in Florida,

33:49.915 --> 33:51.085
lying to the press.

33:51.095 --> 33:53.345
He ingested a truth bug.

33:53.415 --> 33:55.255
See, these blunders
are the exact reason

33:55.335 --> 33:56.925
why we should lock up
the Legends.

34:00.925 --> 34:03.055
Oh!

34:03.065 --> 34:07.075
Nathaniel, are you all right?

34:07.145 --> 34:08.784
No, I'm not.

34:08.855 --> 34:11.405
I've been keeping secrets
from you.

34:11.485 --> 34:13.315
You think I don't know that?

34:13.395 --> 34:16.864
But it's more than your
secret Pentagon side project.

34:16.945 --> 34:18.074
It's always been like this, Dad.

34:18.085 --> 34:19.245
The... the lying

34:19.315 --> 34:21.405
and the hiding of the feelings.

34:21.425 --> 34:23.125
Now that I'm getting to be
honest, I just want to tell you

34:23.205 --> 34:25.034
that I love you, but you
just make it so damn hard.

34:25.114 --> 34:27.045
Look, son, you don't understand.

34:27.054 --> 34:29.205
And I like working with you
at the Time Bureau side by side.

34:29.284 --> 34:31.045
I've never felt closer to you.

34:31.125 --> 34:32.835
But now I'm having,
like, a hard time

34:32.915 --> 34:34.465
even looking in your face.

34:34.545 --> 34:38.005
Just tell me why.
Why are you doing all this?

34:38.085 --> 34:42.014
Why are you pretending
that we are on the same side?

34:42.094 --> 34:44.775
I can't.

34:44.855 --> 34:49.945
But everything
I've done has been for you.

34:50.025 --> 34:53.065
And the fact that it's hurting
you, Nate, it's killing me.

34:53.145 --> 34:56.235
But I want to make this right.

34:56.315 --> 34:58.535
Okay.

34:58.615 --> 35:00.665
You let the Legends walk.

35:00.745 --> 35:02.825
That, or you lock me up, too.

35:02.905 --> 35:04.365
Because if you don't trust them,

35:04.445 --> 35:06.535
then you and I
are not on the same side.

35:08.995 --> 35:13.585
Stand down.
The Legends are free to go.

35:13.665 --> 35:16.215
From now on, we work together.

35:16.295 --> 35:19.105
No more lies.

35:23.555 --> 35:26.485
Watch yourself, love.
She's not in her right mind.

35:26.565 --> 35:30.725
Oh, that's the problem.
She is.

35:30.735 --> 35:33.395
Mona, look, please stop.

35:33.475 --> 35:36.825
I should have never
blamed you for everything.

35:36.905 --> 35:40.785
Look, Ava, the ship, Konane,
none of it was your fault.

35:40.855 --> 35:45.075
And I am so sorry that I told
you to ignore your feelings.

35:45.155 --> 35:47.245
It was because I thought...

35:47.325 --> 35:49.085
Look, I thought that
if I could forget the way that

35:49.155 --> 35:51.455
I was feeling, then maybe
it wouldn't hurt so bad.

35:54.085 --> 35:56.125
Look, Mona. I was wrong.

35:56.205 --> 36:01.015
I was so wrong.

36:01.095 --> 36:04.925
And you don't have to
bury your feelings.

36:05.005 --> 36:08.395
You can let them out.

36:30.365 --> 36:35.215
And if you ever need
a shoulder to lean on,

36:35.225 --> 36:37.375
I will be there.

36:37.455 --> 36:40.505
You promise?

36:40.585 --> 36:42.135
I promise.

36:57.425 --> 37:00.295
- Are you guys okay?
- Yes, no, I don't know.

37:00.375 --> 37:02.935
First time in my adult life
I told my dad I love him.

37:03.005 --> 37:05.135
Years of therapy couldn't even
get me to do that.

37:05.215 --> 37:06.855
Hey, speaking of,
I love you so big.

37:06.925 --> 37:08.425
I love you so big.

37:08.435 --> 37:10.265
I love you so big.
Aww.

37:10.345 --> 37:12.935
Look, I don't always
agree with you, but, uh,

37:12.945 --> 37:16.025
if Nathaniel trusts you,
then so do I.

37:16.105 --> 37:18.995
You're free to fly if you can
get that ship of yours working.

37:19.065 --> 37:22.825
<i>Someone ask for lift?</i>

37:27.455 --> 37:28.875
Ship was never broken was it?

37:28.955 --> 37:31.115
Nope,
it was Zari the whole time.

37:31.195 --> 37:33.785
- Is she even your girlfriend?
- Nope, but I'm open to it.

37:33.865 --> 37:35.715
Fat chance.

37:35.795 --> 37:36.965
Come on your poor bastard.

37:37.045 --> 37:38.385
Let's delouse you and get that

37:38.465 --> 37:40.215
truth bug contained
for good, yeah?

37:40.225 --> 37:42.545
And Nixon here has an
important speech to deliver.

37:42.555 --> 37:44.885
Let's get you back to Orlando.

37:44.895 --> 37:48.715
You know, the truth
really does set you free.

37:48.795 --> 37:50.775
After spending a few days with
all of you,

37:50.845 --> 37:52.385
I know that I can be

37:52.405 --> 37:55.895
a better leader,
and even more so, a better man.

37:55.905 --> 37:59.145
Ah.
History needs you crooked, Dick.

38:02.985 --> 38:04.405
Who are you?

38:04.415 --> 38:06.155
I really think
I'm gonna miss this thing.

38:06.235 --> 38:08.575
Yeah, if I had to be
stuck on a road trip

38:08.585 --> 38:10.155
at least it was with you guys.

38:10.165 --> 38:12.245
You know,
maybe that's what family is.

38:12.255 --> 38:14.925
The people you don't mind
being annoyed by.

38:16.335 --> 38:18.845
So you don't mind
being annoyed by me?

38:18.915 --> 38:20.625
Are you saying I can stay?

38:20.705 --> 38:22.795
We could always use
another shoulder to lean on.

38:22.875 --> 38:24.635
Besides, you're not
the first magical creature

38:24.715 --> 38:25.755
that we've taken in.

38:27.295 --> 38:29.135
We forgot Charlie!

38:32.935 --> 38:34.595
Uh, Nate, hold up.

38:34.675 --> 38:37.225
Gary surprisingly
got to the bottom of things.

38:37.305 --> 38:38.275
It's not good.

38:38.355 --> 38:39.895
Your dad's embezzling funds

38:39.975 --> 38:42.435
for some black site
operation in Baltimore.

38:42.455 --> 38:44.405
But he's not just
taking the fugitives;

38:44.485 --> 38:45.815
he's testing on them.

38:45.895 --> 38:47.525
- But why?
- I don't know.

38:47.605 --> 38:49.955
But I've seen
this before with A.R.G.U.S.

38:50.035 --> 38:51.405
This is what
they were doing to metas

38:51.485 --> 38:55.115
to turn them into
super soldiers.

38:56.295 --> 38:58.415
You okay?

38:58.425 --> 38:59.955
Yeah.

39:00.035 --> 39:02.375
Now I know
who my father really is.

39:02.455 --> 39:04.545
Hank says he's
doing this for me,

39:04.555 --> 39:09.215
but I want nothing
to do with it or him.

39:09.295 --> 39:11.265
Hey, I... I'm sorry.

39:16.555 --> 39:19.605
Um, yeah.

39:30.535 --> 39:32.155
You called.

39:32.165 --> 39:34.795
A little late for a meeting.
This better be good.

39:36.505 --> 39:41.245
When you came to me, uh,
I agreed to this plan,

39:41.325 --> 39:44.515
because I saw the potential
in your vision and I still do.

39:44.585 --> 39:46.675
Don't tell me
you're having second thoughts.

39:54.295 --> 39:56.095
I mean no disrespect.

39:56.175 --> 39:58.805
Um, I value the work
that we've done,

39:58.885 --> 40:01.695
and I understand why it
needs to remain top secret.

40:03.985 --> 40:08.695
But I have a new partner now.

40:08.705 --> 40:11.115
My son.

40:11.185 --> 40:14.155
And I can't let anything
come between us.

40:14.235 --> 40:17.455
What are you saying, Henry?

40:17.525 --> 40:19.005
I'm saying that
I don't need you anymore.

40:19.075 --> 40:20.215
If that's the case,

40:20.285 --> 40:22.205
I don't need you anymore either.

40:22.215 --> 40:25.175
No!

40:25.255 --> 40:27.295
You have to let me out of here.

40:27.375 --> 40:30.675
You gotta let me out of here!

40:30.745 --> 40:32.255
Gary!

40:32.335 --> 40:33.715
Anybody!

40:33.725 --> 40:36.015
No, no, no!

40:45.815 --> 40:48.315
No, no!

40:48.395 --> 40:50.855
Someone help me!

41:04.165 --> 41:06.095
No.
No, no, no, no.

41:06.165 --> 41:08.585
No, no, no, no.
Dad?

41:08.595 --> 41:10.335
Nate.

41:10.415 --> 41:12.975
What did you do?

41:13.055 --> 41:15.885
What did you do?

41:21.305 --> 41:24.615
Nate.
Listen, listen to me.

41:24.685 --> 41:26.185
Right there!

41:30.305 --> 41:32.695
I'm sorry.
