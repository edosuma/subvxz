00:20.111 --> 00:22.279
I hope you didn't
need this jar.

00:22.280 --> 00:23.246
We're getting
into canning.

00:23.281 --> 00:24.247
What are you gonna can?

00:24.248 --> 00:25.549
Farts.
Oh!

00:25.550 --> 00:26.817
When you need one,
you don't have one.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.351
And when you have one,
you need more!

00:28.386 --> 00:29.619
Wash it when you're done!

00:29.654 --> 00:32.222
Wait. If we freeze the
fart, it'll last forever!

00:32.256 --> 00:33.623
It'll be all that's left

00:33.624 --> 00:34.858
of the human race
when the aliens show up.

00:34.892 --> 00:36.293
Ha-ha, aliens!

00:36.294 --> 00:37.728
We farted on you!

00:37.729 --> 00:39.496
Hey, let's go down and see

00:39.497 --> 00:41.231
if we can make the walk-in
cold enough to make fartcicles.

00:41.265 --> 00:42.766
Guess who just went
to the doctor

00:42.767 --> 00:44.501
for his five-year checkup?
Kirstie Alley.

00:44.502 --> 00:45.936
Me. Longest I've been
naked in three years.

00:45.937 --> 00:47.371
Well, what'd he say?

00:47.405 --> 00:48.972
Doctor stuff.

00:48.973 --> 00:50.741
You know, "Your cholesterol
is off the charts."

00:50.742 --> 00:53.643
"You absolutely must change your
eating habits, or you will die."

00:53.678 --> 00:55.078
Anyway, one cheeseburger
and fries, please.

00:55.079 --> 00:57.647
Maybe you should be
a little concerned, right?

00:57.682 --> 00:59.516
You eat a burger
pretty much every day.

00:59.517 --> 01:01.585
That-that can't be good for you.
Yeah.

01:01.619 --> 01:03.587
Right. Don't you eat
your burgers every day?

01:03.621 --> 01:04.988
Not every day.
Yeah. We order off-menu.

01:04.989 --> 01:06.590
It's how we
have fun, right?

01:06.591 --> 01:08.158
Kill me.

01:08.192 --> 01:09.626
Ha-ha, that's nice.

01:09.627 --> 01:11.194
Anyway, cheeseburger
and fries, please.

01:11.195 --> 01:13.196
You sure you want
to ignore your doctor, Teddy?

01:13.197 --> 01:15.432
I'm not ignoring him.
I'm just not listening to him.

01:21.506 --> 01:23.206
- Bob's Burgers.
- This is Teddy's doctor.

01:23.207 --> 01:24.875
Let's take a look
at Teddy's heart, shall we?

01:24.876 --> 01:26.276
Okay.

01:26.310 --> 01:27.844
Whoa.
That's strange.

01:27.845 --> 01:28.845
Oh, hey...
hey, that tickles!

01:28.846 --> 01:30.013
What are you doing?

01:30.014 --> 01:31.715
Whoa.
Look at that.

01:31.716 --> 01:33.583
Sick!
Can I bring that to show-and-tell?!

01:33.618 --> 01:35.786
See how disgustingly
unhealthy it is?

01:35.787 --> 01:39.623
And it gets bigger and bigger
with every burger you serve him.

01:39.624 --> 01:41.058
Uh...

01:41.059 --> 01:43.527
Doctor, stop shoving
burgers into his heart!

01:43.528 --> 01:46.163
Oh, but I'm not, Bob. You are.

01:46.164 --> 01:47.564
Mmm! Keep 'em
coming, Bob.

01:47.565 --> 01:49.900
Oh, God, no!
Keep 'em coming...

01:49.901 --> 01:51.735
No!
Keep 'em coming!

01:51.736 --> 01:52.903
It's gonna pop!
It's gonna blow!

01:52.904 --> 01:54.338
I'm sorry, Teddy!

01:54.339 --> 01:55.739
What? What happened?
What-what happened?

01:55.740 --> 01:57.207
I'm killing Teddy.

01:57.208 --> 01:58.709
What? You're gonna
kill Teddy?

01:58.710 --> 02:01.211
All right, car's gassed up.
That's good.

02:01.212 --> 02:03.331
Guess I could
home-school the kids 'cause...

02:03.348 --> 02:05.882
No, Lin, the burgers are killing him.
What?

02:05.883 --> 02:07.551
The ones I give
him every day.

02:07.552 --> 02:08.884
Oh. Gotcha.

02:08.886 --> 02:10.988
Good God, Linda.
You had all that ready?

02:10.989 --> 02:13.056
What? I'm just being supportive.
Good night.

02:15.660 --> 02:17.327
Lowering the temperature
a few degrees really works.

02:17.328 --> 02:18.895
I should have worn
my higher socks.

02:18.896 --> 02:20.330
You guys call them pants.

02:20.331 --> 02:21.732
Is it frozen?

02:21.733 --> 02:23.634
Sorry, kids,
no fartsicles.

02:23.668 --> 02:25.068
Just disappoint-sicles.

02:25.103 --> 02:27.037
Well, this
experiment was a bust.

02:27.038 --> 02:28.772
Aah! Stupid patch of ice!

02:28.773 --> 02:30.407
Sorry, you're not stupid.
You're just slippery.

02:30.408 --> 02:31.985
Hold on.

02:32.010 --> 02:36.364
This stupid patch of ice
might actually be a genius.

02:38.049 --> 02:41.718
And tomorrow, the walk-in
goes from stinky to rinky.

02:41.753 --> 02:43.920
Feels weird cooking
a veggie burger.

02:43.921 --> 02:45.756
Plus, he's going to know
it's not a hamburger.

02:45.757 --> 02:48.125
Nah, nah, Teddy'll eat whatever
you put in front of him.

02:48.126 --> 02:49.593
Remember when he
ate that receipt?

02:49.594 --> 02:50.861
Well, I hope you're right.

02:53.264 --> 02:55.599
This tastes kind of funny.

02:55.633 --> 02:57.501
You don't need to look at it.
Just eat it.

02:57.535 --> 02:58.936
It tastes burger-ish,
but not good.

02:58.937 --> 03:00.537
Is that what you were going for?

03:00.571 --> 03:02.572
It's a...
Veggie burger.

03:02.607 --> 03:04.074
It's a what?
A veggie burger?!

03:04.108 --> 03:05.342
Listen...
Agh! Ugh!

03:05.376 --> 03:07.010
Why would you do that? Oh!

03:07.045 --> 03:08.745
Why? Oh!
Teddy...

03:08.746 --> 03:10.080
Now I can't get the taste out
of my mouth.

03:10.114 --> 03:11.748
Ugh! Look,
I can't in good conscience

03:11.749 --> 03:13.617
serve you a burger
every day.

03:13.651 --> 03:15.719
I don't see you shoving a veggie
burger down Mort's throat,

03:15.720 --> 03:17.120
and he eats a burger every day.

03:17.121 --> 03:19.089
That's not true.
I often get the soup.

03:19.090 --> 03:21.091
What?! You do? Soup?!

03:21.125 --> 03:22.192
Take it easy, Teddy.

03:22.226 --> 03:23.627
Wait. Teddy,

03:23.628 --> 03:24.995
you eat a burger every day?

03:24.996 --> 03:26.496
Of course I do!
That's messed-up.

03:26.497 --> 03:28.365
You eat a lot of burgers,
Mike, the mailman!

03:28.399 --> 03:30.901
Yeah, but I walk nine miles
a day. Look at my calves.

03:30.902 --> 03:33.270
Wait. Don't look at my calves.
They're not that impressive.

03:33.304 --> 03:34.738
Okay, here's
the deal, Teddy.

03:34.739 --> 03:36.340
I'll-I'll make you soup
or salad,

03:36.341 --> 03:38.742
but I don't think I can
serve you my burgers anymore.

03:38.776 --> 03:39.876
You cutting me off, Bobby?

03:39.911 --> 03:41.144
I guess I am.

03:41.179 --> 03:42.613
You're cutting me off?!

03:42.614 --> 03:44.014
Is this some kind
of sick joke?!

03:44.015 --> 03:45.515
I think it's for
your own good.

03:45.516 --> 03:47.184
You stay the hell
out of this, Mort!

03:47.185 --> 03:48.852
Bob, if you take
your burgers from me,

03:48.853 --> 03:50.821
I will murder you
and your mouthy wife.

03:50.855 --> 03:52.823
What?
Huh? I'm sorry!

03:52.824 --> 03:54.191
I don't know what I'm saying.

03:54.192 --> 03:55.492
I'll kill you!
Give me a burger!

03:55.526 --> 03:56.960
Teddy!
Calm... down.

03:56.961 --> 03:58.462
You calm down!

03:58.496 --> 03:59.997
Oh, my God.

03:59.998 --> 04:02.666
Whoa.
I will replace that.

04:02.700 --> 04:05.102
I don't want to be alive.
I don't want to be alive!

04:05.103 --> 04:07.318
He's handling this well.
Mm-hmm.

04:09.447 --> 04:11.648
Fire! There's a fire. Fire!

04:11.649 --> 04:13.550
No, Lin, it's
the alarm clock.

04:13.551 --> 04:15.118
What? Snooze it.

04:15.119 --> 04:16.519
Oh, you know the
buttons don't work.

04:16.521 --> 04:17.887
I have to unplug it.

04:17.889 --> 04:19.723
Someone unplug the alarm clock!

04:19.724 --> 04:21.225
Thank you!

04:21.226 --> 04:23.327
Where are you going
so early?

04:23.328 --> 04:25.162
I told Teddy
I'd go jogging with him.

04:25.163 --> 04:27.030
He wants to prove to me
that he's healthy enough

04:27.031 --> 04:29.433
to be un-cut-off
from our burgers.

04:29.467 --> 04:30.868
Why are you running
if you don't want to?

04:30.869 --> 04:32.536
Just tell your teacher
you have sciatica.

04:32.537 --> 04:35.005
I think it's sweet
you're helping your best friend.

04:35.039 --> 04:37.608
Teddy's not my best friend.
Teddy thinks you're best friends.

04:37.609 --> 04:39.042
- He does?
- Sure.

04:39.043 --> 04:40.310
Yup.

04:40.311 --> 04:41.678
Wait. Who's your
best friend then?

04:41.679 --> 04:43.280
Mm... probably
Walter Russo.

04:43.314 --> 04:44.748
Walter Russo?!

04:44.749 --> 04:46.884
When was the last time
you talked to Walter Russo?

04:46.885 --> 04:48.719
I don't know,
like, six years ago.

04:48.753 --> 04:50.387
Bob, you see Teddy
every day.

04:50.421 --> 04:52.389
Yeah, but Teddy's not
my best friend, Lin.

04:52.390 --> 04:53.857
He's my best customer.

04:53.858 --> 04:55.492
There's a big difference.

04:55.493 --> 04:57.160
And I really value
that 30 inches

04:57.161 --> 04:59.029
of Formica that's between us.

04:59.063 --> 05:01.899
Are you talking about
your dingdong, Daddy? Brag.

05:01.900 --> 05:05.035
Yeah, well, off to take
my best customer jogging

05:05.036 --> 05:06.904
so his heart
doesn't explode.

05:06.905 --> 05:08.539
All right, have fun.

05:08.540 --> 05:09.907
Are you all in bed with Mom?

05:09.908 --> 05:11.341
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

05:11.342 --> 05:12.709
Coming up,
coming up.

05:14.279 --> 05:15.712
Oh, our little
seal platform.

05:17.115 --> 05:18.582
What is that?

05:18.583 --> 05:20.384
My alarm clock.
Got to go.

05:20.385 --> 05:22.186
Oh! Uh, we gotta go

05:22.187 --> 05:23.687
check on... nothing!

05:23.688 --> 05:26.023
Oh, yeah, maybe
the nothing's ready!

05:26.024 --> 05:28.358
Aw.

05:31.729 --> 05:34.598
It's... perfect.

05:34.599 --> 05:36.300
Huh? Look how
high my knees are!

05:36.301 --> 05:38.035
I'm in great shape.

05:38.036 --> 05:39.469
Great enough
for one burger?

05:39.470 --> 05:40.938
I don't think so, Teddy.
Oh.

05:40.972 --> 05:42.406
Should we call the cops?

05:42.407 --> 05:44.541
Some kind of
early morning gang brawl?

05:44.576 --> 05:46.910
Wait... I-I think
they're fake fighting.

05:46.911 --> 05:48.745
Excuse me. What-what's
going on over there?

05:48.780 --> 05:50.147
It's called stuntman boot camp.

05:50.148 --> 05:51.682
I'm in the best shape
of my life.

05:51.716 --> 05:53.884
You're a stuntman?
No. I just train like one.

05:53.885 --> 05:55.018
You should check it out.

05:55.053 --> 05:56.420
Whoa.

05:56.454 --> 05:58.088
Grenade!

05:58.089 --> 05:59.723
And another grenade!

05:59.724 --> 06:02.559
Got to admit, that
looks kind of cool.

06:02.560 --> 06:03.894
Sort of cool.

06:03.895 --> 06:05.229
Well, that guy
doesn't look cool.

06:05.263 --> 06:07.331
All right, great
"grenadies," everybody.

06:07.332 --> 06:09.733
Now, don't forget to
sign up for the intensive,

06:09.734 --> 06:11.568
weekend-long, stuntman
boot camp in the woods.

06:11.569 --> 06:13.704
Where you might learn
how to do this.

06:13.738 --> 06:16.106
Go ahead. Now this is actually
a ten-story burning building,

06:16.107 --> 06:17.474
and I'm on fire.

06:17.475 --> 06:19.142
Ow! On fire!
Oh, wow.

06:19.177 --> 06:21.778
I'm on fire! I'm on fire!
So much fire!

06:21.813 --> 06:23.447
Falling and rolling
like you're on fire

06:23.448 --> 06:25.015
burns as many calories
as running, people.

06:25.016 --> 06:26.617
That is why, pound for pound,

06:26.618 --> 06:28.118
stuntmen are the greatest
athletes in the world.

06:28.119 --> 06:29.931
Up top!

06:29.954 --> 06:31.321
Huh. I thought
it was golfers.

06:31.322 --> 06:32.556
It's not golfers?

06:32.590 --> 06:35.025
Holy frozen nips!

06:35.026 --> 06:36.860
Look at this place!

06:36.861 --> 06:38.595
It's so slippery!

06:39.631 --> 06:40.998
Yeah, we like it.

06:40.999 --> 06:42.399
It's all right, I guess.

06:42.433 --> 06:44.201
So, what do you
do down here?

06:44.202 --> 06:47.104
Well, we've experimented
with lots of stuff. We tried

06:47.138 --> 06:48.639
- curling.
- We tried lying

06:48.640 --> 06:50.407
on the ice.
That was refreshing.

06:50.441 --> 06:52.142
Some of us didn't like it
as much as others,

06:52.143 --> 06:53.911
but we respect their opinions.

06:53.945 --> 06:55.279
And ice fishing.

06:55.280 --> 06:56.480
We did not get a bite.

06:56.514 --> 06:58.048
In the end,

06:58.049 --> 07:00.350
the most fun thing
to do is this!

07:00.351 --> 07:02.319
Whoa!

07:02.353 --> 07:03.921
So... pushing?

07:03.955 --> 07:05.088
Ice pushing.

07:05.123 --> 07:06.824
It all makes sense!

07:07.792 --> 07:10.027
Hi, Andy. Hi, Ollie.

07:10.028 --> 07:11.562
Hi, Louise and Gene
and Tina's mom!

07:11.563 --> 07:12.891
Louise said to say
we're meeting

07:12.897 --> 07:14.565
in the basement
for homework club.

07:14.566 --> 07:16.366
Okay. Have fun.

07:16.367 --> 07:18.168
Homework club?!

07:18.169 --> 07:20.537
Oh, my God, they're doing drugs
to each other!

07:20.572 --> 07:23.440
Push me till
I feel something, Zeke!

07:23.475 --> 07:25.008
Well, well, well.

07:25.043 --> 07:28.212
Mom! Hey, uh, uh, we were
just all getting...

07:28.213 --> 07:30.347
a-a head of...
Yeah?

07:30.348 --> 07:32.549
A head of lettuce. Mom, you didn't
happen to look down, did you?

07:32.584 --> 07:35.819
As a matter of fact, I'm looking
down right now, Tina.

07:35.854 --> 07:38.222
And... it's amazing!

07:38.256 --> 07:39.990
Oh, God, look at it shimmer!

07:40.024 --> 07:41.658
It's frozen water!

07:41.659 --> 07:44.628
They call it "ice," and
it's gonna change the world!

07:44.662 --> 07:47.364
If you're gonna be pushing
each other on the ice like this,

07:47.365 --> 07:49.099
you need to be wearing...
Helmets. I know.

07:49.100 --> 07:50.701
I've been a broken
record about it.

07:50.702 --> 07:52.369
No! Costumes!

07:52.370 --> 07:54.371
Glitzy ones
with sequins!

07:54.405 --> 07:57.574
I want to be the bad boy of
ice pushing like Elvis Stojko!

07:57.575 --> 07:59.710
And I want to be the bad boy
of public radio,

07:59.711 --> 08:01.678
like Elvis Mitchell!

08:01.713 --> 08:03.080
I'll go get the costumes.

08:03.081 --> 08:04.748
Ooh, and don't
tell your father.

08:04.749 --> 08:06.917
We won't if you won't!
Got to love that woman.

08:08.286 --> 08:09.620
Hey, Lin.
Whoa!

08:09.621 --> 08:11.255
Where-where...
where are you going? What?!

08:11.256 --> 08:12.956
What...? What? Nowhere.
What's this stuff?

08:12.957 --> 08:14.291
What? What are we doing?
We're making burgers?

08:14.292 --> 08:15.392
Let's do it.
Let's go.

08:15.393 --> 08:16.927
What's this?
This is to-go?

08:16.928 --> 08:19.530
Hey, buddy, catch! I-I got this.
Geez, Lin.

08:19.531 --> 08:21.031
Here you go.

08:24.602 --> 08:25.969
Hey, there,
Teddy.

08:25.970 --> 08:27.404
One veggie burger, please.

08:27.405 --> 08:29.440
I just got to use
the restroom real quick.

08:29.474 --> 08:31.742
Hmm. You ever see Teddy
with a briefcase before?

08:31.743 --> 08:33.110
Only in that one play.

08:33.111 --> 08:34.611
I forgot about that.

08:34.645 --> 08:36.080
Put the coffee down!

08:36.081 --> 08:38.381
Coffee is
for closers only!

08:38.416 --> 08:39.917
Teddy, what are
you doing in there?

08:39.918 --> 08:41.485
Washing my hands or something.

08:41.486 --> 08:43.453
I can hear you chewing.
You're chewing a burger.

08:43.488 --> 08:45.689
Did you get
that guy to buy you a burger?!

08:45.724 --> 08:47.391
No, I'm just
checking the bathroom

08:47.392 --> 08:49.359
to see that it's not leaking.

08:49.394 --> 08:51.528
He's eating!
Teddy, stop eating.

08:51.563 --> 08:54.131
You don't know
how hard this is for me.

08:54.132 --> 08:56.900
I paid that guy $300
to buy me this burger.

08:56.935 --> 08:58.969
Come on, Teddy,
you owe it to yourself.

08:58.970 --> 09:01.472
No, I don't.
Okay. Well, then do it for me.

09:01.506 --> 09:03.907
Ah, you're just helping me
because you feel guilty.

09:03.908 --> 09:05.309
That's not why.

09:05.310 --> 09:06.744
Yeah, it is.
Admit it, Bobby.

09:06.745 --> 09:08.312
No, it's not.
Admit it!

09:08.346 --> 09:10.814
Teddy, it's because...
you're my friend.

09:10.815 --> 09:12.182
Your best friend!
I didn't say...

09:12.183 --> 09:14.012
Besties.
Linda.

09:14.018 --> 09:16.097
Really, Bob?
We're best friends?

09:16.121 --> 09:17.654
I mean...

09:17.655 --> 09:19.456

09:54.993 --> 09:56.627

09:57.996 --> 09:59.396
Ha, ha! How about that.

09:59.397 --> 10:00.964
Okay, hey, we'll see you
in the morning.

10:00.965 --> 10:02.666
Tremendous news!

10:02.667 --> 10:04.568
Remember how you said that
stuntman boot camp was cool?

10:04.569 --> 10:06.804
You... didn't sign us up
for that, did you?

10:06.805 --> 10:09.473
Better! I signed us up
for the intensive weekend

10:09.474 --> 10:11.041
boot camp retreat
in the woods!

10:11.042 --> 10:12.976
What? You did?
Yup, the whole weekend.

10:12.977 --> 10:15.179
So I'd watch the restaurant,
the walk-in,

10:15.180 --> 10:16.847
everything in the walk-in,
and you'd be gone?

10:16.848 --> 10:18.749
Huh?
Ah, nothing.

10:18.750 --> 10:21.752
And it's two to a cabin, so you
and me will be roomie-caboomies!

10:21.753 --> 10:23.387
I don't know, Teddy.

10:23.388 --> 10:25.723
That, um, doesn't sound
like something I want to do.

10:25.724 --> 10:28.559
What?! You've always wanted
to do stunts in the woods.

10:28.560 --> 10:30.494
Yeah. Get the
hell out of here!

10:30.495 --> 10:32.262
Yeah, go for it, Dad.
Do it!

10:32.263 --> 10:34.331
Though you've already pulled off
the toughest stunt of all...

10:34.332 --> 10:36.400
raising three great kids. Yeah.

10:36.401 --> 10:37.835
Come on, Bobby.
My treat!

10:37.836 --> 10:40.004
Okay, I'll go.
That's, um...

10:40.005 --> 10:43.007
Thanks. Aw, it's nothin'.
Well, not nothin'.

10:43.008 --> 10:44.241
I won't have electricity
for three months.

11:02.904 --> 11:04.805
So take it easy, okay?

11:04.806 --> 11:07.408
You're not in the best shape,
you know. I know, best buddy.

11:07.442 --> 11:10.110
Okay. Now I need everybody to
breath out stress... Mm-hmm.

11:10.111 --> 11:13.313
...breath in stunts.
Stunts.

11:13.314 --> 11:15.516
Congratulations, you've now
got stunts inside of you.

11:15.517 --> 11:17.157
Now we're gonna get
cracking and roll down

11:17.185 --> 11:18.485
these stairs here.
So everybody knows

11:18.486 --> 11:20.320
that falling down
a flight of stairs

11:20.355 --> 11:23.257
is the same as doing 100 sit-ups.
Really? We're doing this?

11:23.258 --> 11:25.492
You're a mid-level drug dealer
in an apartment stairwell.

11:25.493 --> 11:27.961
Cameras are rolling.
Bang! You've been shot. Uh...

11:27.962 --> 11:29.963
Action! Action, man!
Go! You got to go!

11:29.964 --> 11:31.231
Go! This is a go.
That's you, Bobby.

11:31.266 --> 11:32.266
That was a go.
Go, go, go go, go...!

11:32.267 --> 11:33.100
What? Wait a... Aah!

11:33.134 --> 11:34.835
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

11:34.869 --> 11:37.337
Ow.
Wow! That was terrible!

11:37.338 --> 11:39.940
Wait, have you done any of
your morning melees in the park?

11:39.941 --> 11:41.341
No!
Oh!

11:41.342 --> 11:42.810
Well, then you could
really get hurt.

11:42.811 --> 11:45.279
Welcome to the Freezer-Dome!

11:45.280 --> 11:48.982
Whoever wins this whole shebang
takes this baby home!

11:48.983 --> 11:51.685
Ooh. It's beautiful.

11:51.720 --> 11:54.254
Aw. You all look so cute.

11:54.289 --> 11:55.522
Everyone got their pillows?

11:55.523 --> 11:57.424
Yes.

11:57.459 --> 12:00.461
Now let's rumble! If your butt
touches ice, you're dead.

12:00.495 --> 12:02.730
Really?
No. No, you're just out, honey.

12:02.731 --> 12:05.332
Two kids enter, one kid leaves!

12:05.367 --> 12:09.002
Two kids enter, one kid leaves!

12:09.003 --> 12:11.405
First up,
Rudy versus Louise! Go!

12:11.406 --> 12:13.640
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Why am I going against Rudy?

12:13.641 --> 12:15.309
He's a pushover, a cupcake.

12:15.310 --> 12:16.677
What? I'm tough.

12:16.711 --> 12:18.712
Rudy, I'm in your P.E. class.

12:18.713 --> 12:21.415
I was there
for the kickball incident.

12:21.416 --> 12:22.850
That was humbling.
Yeah.

12:22.884 --> 12:24.718
Hey, it's called weight class,
cool breeze.

12:24.719 --> 12:27.354
Deal with it. You can't hang
with the big boys, anyway.

12:27.355 --> 12:28.989
Oh, I can't hang
with the big boys?

12:28.990 --> 12:30.491
No, I'm gonna hang
with the big boys.

12:30.492 --> 12:31.491
You'll see.

12:31.493 --> 12:32.659
Look at me. Ding!

12:34.062 --> 12:35.729
Oh. All right, take care, buddy.

12:35.730 --> 12:36.997
Next!

12:36.998 --> 12:38.465
That's Mama's girl!

12:38.500 --> 12:40.200
This is sugar
glass, everyone.

12:40.235 --> 12:43.070
Fights often end with someone
flying through a window.

12:43.071 --> 12:44.838
It's a staple
in action movies.

12:44.839 --> 12:47.841
And an amazing cardio workout,
which you can incorporate

12:47.842 --> 12:50.444
into your daily routine.
My grandmother does it.

12:50.445 --> 12:52.613
Now, Teddy, you're looking for
the guy who kidnapped your daughter.

12:52.614 --> 12:54.448
Bob, you're the
guy who kidnapped

12:54.449 --> 12:55.649
his daughter.
Ooh.

12:55.684 --> 12:57.017
You are a horrible person.

12:57.018 --> 12:58.552
Teddy wants revenge. Go!

12:58.553 --> 13:00.020
Wait, why am I the person
who's...

13:00.021 --> 13:01.488
No!

13:01.523 --> 13:04.058
Where's my daughter, punk?!

13:04.092 --> 13:06.260
Get...
Teddy, get off.

13:06.261 --> 13:07.528
Get off!

13:07.529 --> 13:09.496
Today, one of you will advance

13:09.531 --> 13:11.932
to the Freezer-Dome
championship.

13:11.967 --> 13:13.667
The other one will
leave in shame.

13:13.702 --> 13:15.369
But all the losers get stickers.

13:15.370 --> 13:16.770
Stickers of shame!

13:16.771 --> 13:18.572
Now fight! Clank-clank!

13:18.606 --> 13:20.074
You're going down, Zeke.

13:20.075 --> 13:21.909
Good luck
with my low center of gravity.

13:21.910 --> 13:23.844
I'm practically unpushoverable.

13:23.878 --> 13:25.212
We'll see about that.

13:25.213 --> 13:26.914
Come on, girl!

13:26.948 --> 13:28.248
I told you

13:28.283 --> 13:29.282
you're going...

13:29.284 --> 13:30.751
...down.

13:30.785 --> 13:32.619
Yeah! I did it! I pushed a girl

13:32.620 --> 13:34.788
and not because I like her
and didn't know how to show it!

13:34.823 --> 13:36.490
Oh. Sorry, sweetie.

13:36.491 --> 13:38.492
You got to get off the ice.
Go on, get off.

13:38.493 --> 13:40.127
Louise versus Gene!

13:40.161 --> 13:41.462
Easy win, Gene.

13:41.463 --> 13:42.963
I'll be waiting for you
in the finals.

13:42.998 --> 13:45.265
Well, if he shows up
to the finals and looks like me,

13:45.266 --> 13:47.267
that's because
it's me, Zeke!

13:47.268 --> 13:48.936
I'm Mommy to both of you,

13:48.937 --> 13:51.572
but let's see who wants
Mommy's love more. Ding!

13:51.606 --> 13:53.741
I want Mom's love pretty bad,
so look out.

13:56.144 --> 13:58.479
Oh, yeah?
How 'bout a little of this?

13:58.480 --> 14:00.381
Well, you're sturdier
than I thought.

14:00.415 --> 14:01.949
Sturdy and purdy.

14:01.950 --> 14:04.351
Hold on, hold on.
I got something in my eye.

14:04.352 --> 14:06.353
Man,
it's really in there.

14:06.354 --> 14:08.822
Gene, have a seat.
This could take a while.

14:08.857 --> 14:10.924
No problem.
You fell for it!

14:10.959 --> 14:12.960
Aw!
She beat you fair and square,

14:12.961 --> 14:15.963
unfairly,
here in the Freezer-Dome!

14:15.997 --> 14:18.599
She advances
to the finals tomorrow!

14:18.633 --> 14:21.101
I'm coming for you, Zeke!

14:21.136 --> 14:22.236
Bring it on!

14:27.742 --> 14:30.577
You've got to
be kidding me.

14:35.784 --> 14:38.185
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

14:41.356 --> 14:43.123
Wake up, stuntboys!

14:43.124 --> 14:45.225
I'm sorry that was weird...
I don't have a bugle.

14:45.226 --> 14:47.461
It can't be morning.
No, no, no, no, no.

14:47.462 --> 14:50.130
Big day today! You're gonna
get chased by robots,

14:50.131 --> 14:53.500
get set on fire... it literally
burns the calories right off.

14:55.804 --> 14:56.737
Freeze, human.

14:56.738 --> 14:58.973
We have
apprehended you.

14:58.974 --> 15:01.375
Beep beep. All right, time-out, time-out,
time-out. What is going on here?

15:01.376 --> 15:03.811
Oh, my God. You don't have the mental
fortitude of someone that wants

15:03.812 --> 15:06.146
to train to not be
an actual stuntman.

15:06.147 --> 15:08.015
It's like you don't
even want to be here.

15:08.016 --> 15:10.384
Because I don't!
What?!

15:10.385 --> 15:12.653
Look, guys, I only came here
as a workout buddy

15:12.654 --> 15:14.822
for my friend Teddy
because I felt guilty.

15:14.823 --> 15:17.024
I mean, he's not even my friend.

15:17.058 --> 15:18.692
What are your words
even meaning?

15:18.727 --> 15:20.160
Listen, between you and me,

15:20.161 --> 15:21.829
I had to say
he was my best friend

15:21.830 --> 15:24.865
so he'd get healthy and not eat
my burgers all the time.

15:24.866 --> 15:26.367
Oh, I sell burgers.

15:26.368 --> 15:28.269
So he's really my best customer,

15:28.270 --> 15:30.704
'cause all he does
is shove burgers in his mouth.

15:30.705 --> 15:33.107
But he's not my best friend.

15:34.442 --> 15:35.609
Oh.

15:35.610 --> 15:37.444
Oh, my God.
Hey, Teddy.

15:37.445 --> 15:39.847
Hey. So, uh, you just heard

15:39.848 --> 15:41.982
all that.
And you're on fire.

15:42.017 --> 15:43.918
Those words hurt more
than that fire.

15:43.919 --> 15:46.253
Yeah, he's gonna be
scarred inside and outside.

15:46.254 --> 15:48.522
And o... We should put... Put him out...
he's scarring. We should put him out.

15:48.523 --> 15:50.191
He's starting to scar.
Yeah.

15:52.812 --> 15:54.679
How could you lie
to me like that?!

15:54.680 --> 15:56.514
Who says they're someone's
best friend when they're not?!

15:56.515 --> 15:58.350
I lied because I
care about you.

15:58.351 --> 16:00.885
Pull over here. Here!
Stop the car, Bob!

16:00.920 --> 16:03.321
You're not the only guy
that serves burgers.

16:03.322 --> 16:06.758
I'm gonna be a regular
at Dusty's Feedbag now, friend.

16:06.759 --> 16:08.460
Come on, Teddy, d... Oh,

16:08.494 --> 16:10.295
and one more thing...
three years ago,

16:10.296 --> 16:13.832
you forgot a tomato on my burger
and I said nothing... nothing!

16:13.833 --> 16:16.167
Teddy, don't go in there!
You don't tell me what to do!

16:16.168 --> 16:18.269
Oh, wait, I guess
this entrance isn't open.

16:18.270 --> 16:19.938
It's around the back.

16:19.939 --> 16:22.007
Then just come back here.
You... Keep driving!

16:22.008 --> 16:24.442
Is it around the side or...
Where am I? Something.

16:24.443 --> 16:26.945
It's right there in the front, the huge
entrance. I think this door goes...

16:26.946 --> 16:30.181
Get out of here, Bob!
I don't need your help!

16:30.216 --> 16:32.050
Boys and girls, girls and boys,

16:32.051 --> 16:34.219
future adults of America,

16:34.220 --> 16:36.855
it's time for the most important
thing in the world...

16:36.856 --> 16:40.592
the Freezer-Dome finals!

16:40.626 --> 16:42.527
Only one of you will go home
with this!

16:44.497 --> 16:46.231
I want that belt.
And I'm not gonna fall

16:46.232 --> 16:47.666
for your little tricks, girl.

16:47.700 --> 16:50.001
I wouldn't try
to trick you, Zeke.

16:50.036 --> 16:51.836
Ding! Ow! Oh, wait, wait, wait!
I got something in my eye.

16:51.837 --> 16:53.471
Hold on, hold on.

16:53.472 --> 16:55.874
All right, I guess
I'll just take a seat here,

16:55.875 --> 16:58.877
bend my little knees down...
Ha! Just kidding!

16:58.878 --> 17:02.380
Hey, hey, you had to try. You
know why? 'Cause you're tiny!

17:02.381 --> 17:03.548
Ah!

17:03.549 --> 17:05.317
You're
home early.

17:05.318 --> 17:06.718
What, did you
pull a hammy?

17:06.719 --> 17:08.987
No. Long story.
Where's Linda?

17:09.021 --> 17:11.223
Downstairs, I think.
Mike, what are you doing?

17:11.257 --> 17:12.691
That's weird.
I'm normally over there.

17:12.692 --> 17:14.159
I thought you were with Teddy.

17:14.193 --> 17:16.027
Uh, he's at Dusty's Feedbag,

17:16.028 --> 17:17.662
his new favorite restaurant.

17:17.663 --> 17:19.396
Oh, that's not good.
Why?

17:19.397 --> 17:21.398
You haven't heard
of the Belt Buckle Belly Buster?

17:21.400 --> 17:22.666
They serve that there.

17:22.667 --> 17:24.368
Belt Buckle Belly Buster?

17:24.369 --> 17:25.737
It's a five-pound burger.

17:25.738 --> 17:27.439
If you eat the whole thing
in a half hour,

17:27.440 --> 17:29.541
it's free, and you get
your picture on the wall.

17:29.542 --> 17:32.377
Oh, no, no.
No, no, no, no. Teddy!

17:32.378 --> 17:34.913
So you said it's cool
to have more ice cream?

17:34.947 --> 17:36.348
You're gonna get destroyed.

17:36.349 --> 17:37.749
Throw in the towel!
Never.

17:37.750 --> 17:39.017
Never, never, never!

17:39.018 --> 17:40.418
Finish her!

17:40.453 --> 17:42.454
Why you putting up a fight,
you tiny sweet angel?

17:42.455 --> 17:44.589
Take your medicine, girl.
Just go down.

17:44.590 --> 17:46.091
I'm s...
I'm still totally gonna win,

17:46.092 --> 17:47.559
so shut your mouth.

17:49.962 --> 17:51.963
You might have beaten me,
Louise,

17:51.964 --> 17:54.232
but blood is thicker than ice.
But not actually.

17:54.233 --> 17:56.368
Time to unleash the beast.

17:58.237 --> 17:59.237
Now's your chance!

17:59.272 --> 18:00.705
Oh, God.

18:00.706 --> 18:02.541
Oh, that's what killed
the dinosaurs.

18:02.542 --> 18:04.075
That's awful. Ooh.

18:04.110 --> 18:06.211
Zeke is down!
Louise, you win!

18:06.212 --> 18:09.247
Yay!

18:21.394 --> 18:23.395
You didn't order the Belt Buckle
Belly Buster, did you?

18:23.396 --> 18:25.397
Maybe I did,
maybe I didn't.

18:25.398 --> 18:27.899
But I did. Excuse me.
Uh, are you Dusty?

18:27.900 --> 18:30.569
Dusty?
Uh, no. There's no Dusty.

18:30.570 --> 18:33.905
Uh, this is a chain, pal.
I'm Kevin. I'm the manager.

18:33.906 --> 18:36.608
Listen, Kevin, you can't serve
this guy your five-pound burger.

18:36.609 --> 18:38.343
Oh, okay, making a note.

18:38.344 --> 18:40.645
I can't serve someone a burger
in my own restaurant.

18:40.680 --> 18:42.113
Look, Teddy is... Well...

18:42.114 --> 18:44.316
He has the biggest heart
of anyone I know.

18:44.350 --> 18:45.817
Both because
he's incredibly sweet

18:45.818 --> 18:47.319
but also
because it's full

18:47.353 --> 18:49.521
of cholesterol.
Which is why you can't serve him

18:49.522 --> 18:52.124
that huge burger...
he-he might not survive it.

18:52.158 --> 18:53.825
Well, you know what?
Big boy paid for it,

18:53.826 --> 18:55.127
so order up!

18:55.128 --> 18:56.862
Good God,
look at that thing. Oh.

18:56.863 --> 18:59.030
Let me at it!
You're not giving him that burger.

18:59.031 --> 19:01.700
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on,
let that Belly Buster through.

19:01.701 --> 19:03.969
Please take the burger back to
the kitchen, ma'am.

19:03.970 --> 19:07.372
It is so weird that you think
you work here. I just...

19:07.373 --> 19:09.808
Damn it, I don't remember
hiring a fat Burt Reynolds.

19:09.809 --> 19:11.977
Look, this burger
is not going anywhere.

19:11.978 --> 19:13.812
This is just
fantastic.

19:13.846 --> 19:16.481
I'm gonna get to throw fat Burt
Reynolds out of my restaurant!

19:16.516 --> 19:18.483
Oh, yeah?
Well, I can get tough, too.

19:18.518 --> 19:20.852
And I'm staying. Guys, come on.
Don't fight over me.

19:20.853 --> 19:22.487
Wait, is that what's happening?

19:22.522 --> 19:24.790
Bad news for you, Kevin.
I've just been through

19:24.791 --> 19:26.792
a bunch of kick-ass training,
so if you think

19:26.793 --> 19:28.627
you can just...
Oh, no...

19:28.628 --> 19:31.463
Oh, yeah? Well, I hope you got
trained to get your ass kicked!

19:31.464 --> 19:33.198
Actually, I did! Oh, God!

19:33.199 --> 19:35.300
Here comes the glass!

19:36.202 --> 19:38.970
Thanks for coming!

19:38.971 --> 19:40.505
Are you okay, Bobby?

19:40.540 --> 19:42.340
Real glass hurts so bad.

19:42.341 --> 19:43.542
Am I bleeding?

19:43.576 --> 19:45.143
Not, like, too much.

19:45.144 --> 19:46.545
And the concrete wasn't padded.

19:46.546 --> 19:48.880
It was so hard
when-when I landed on it.

19:48.915 --> 19:51.683
Before you pass out, that's the nicest
thing anyone's ever done for me.

19:51.684 --> 19:54.386
I have so much glass in myself.
I'll get you out of here, buddy.

19:54.420 --> 19:55.687
All right, let's go
to the hospital, Teddy.

19:55.688 --> 19:57.556
No, Bob. Let's go home.

19:57.557 --> 19:59.558
No. No, we're gonna go to
a hospital... Shh, shh, shh.

19:59.559 --> 20:01.526
Home it is, Bob.

20:01.527 --> 20:03.562
Here we go, almost home.

20:03.563 --> 20:06.064
I'll just see if
someone else can take me.

20:06.099 --> 20:07.699
Hey, even though
I'm not your best friend,

20:07.700 --> 20:09.434
I really appreciate
what you did.

20:09.435 --> 20:11.870
Look, I-I'm sorry I said
you're not my best friend.

20:11.871 --> 20:13.872
Because you are.
I am?

20:13.873 --> 20:16.108
Yeah, I mean, it depends
on how you define it.

20:16.109 --> 20:18.610
You technically
are my best friend.

20:18.611 --> 20:20.946
But, I mean... I might meet... Bup,
bup, bup... stop right there, Bobby.

20:20.947 --> 20:22.948
But, I mean, I don't know who...
Yeah. Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

20:22.949 --> 20:25.550
Eventually I... Enough.
Can I carry you across the threshold?

20:25.551 --> 20:26.918
All right.

20:28.955 --> 20:31.323
Ow.
Watch your head. Sorry.

20:31.357 --> 20:33.859
Aw, my little beat-up Bobby.

20:33.860 --> 20:35.694
Where's that belt from?
Where's all the food?

20:35.695 --> 20:37.696
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shush.
Is the ice helping?

20:37.697 --> 20:40.032
Pretty refreshing, right?
Yes, Tina.

20:40.033 --> 20:41.600
How 'bout this?
Is this helping?

20:41.601 --> 20:43.368
Thanks, Teddy.
Yes, it's good.

20:43.369 --> 20:46.371
How 'bout some smelling salts?
Oh, God. Come on!

20:46.372 --> 20:47.957
Oh, you come on.

20:47.958 --> 20:49.999
That fart's a winner
and you know it!

20:50.000 --> 20:51.504
All right,
let me smell it again.
