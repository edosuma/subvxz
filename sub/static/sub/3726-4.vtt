I was just at
the police station visiting

00:04.270 --> 00:06.431
and they're gonna
release Andrew Campbell.

00:06.470 --> 00:07.789
So if they don't think
that he did it--

00:07.840 --> 00:09.364
Then that person
is still out there.

00:09.410 --> 00:12.072
'You girls need
to take precautions.‘

00:12.110 --> 00:13.475
'They were supposed to give me
an anti-anxiety medication'

00:13.510 --> 00:14.602
'to help me sleep.‘

00:14.640 --> 00:16.744
- 'I asked them not to.'
- I need that prescription.

00:16.780 --> 00:18.577
No, you want it.

00:18.610 --> 00:21.044
It's Sara, I-I gave her
one of Caleb's phones.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.184

(Spencer)
_ When we were down there
In that place, we saw a name.

00:35.830 --> 00:37.320
- What name?
- Charles DiLaurentis.

00:37.370 --> 00:38.519
(Hanna)
'So one of those boys is Jason.‘

00:38.570 --> 00:40.128
(Aria)
'And the other one's Charlie.‘

00:40.170 --> 00:41.364
He said your dad
knows all about it.

00:41.400 --> 00:43.459
Who is the other boy
in this photo?

00:46.310 --> 00:47.675
[instrumental music]

00:47.710 --> 00:50.349
So what'd your dad say
when you showed him the picture?

00:50.380 --> 00:52.211
Did he admit Charles
was the boy next to Jason?

00:52.250 --> 00:54.070
Guys, give her a minute.

00:57.350 --> 00:59.284
Charles is my brother.

01:01.160 --> 01:03.151
Then, why hasn't
he been living

01:03.190 --> 01:04.828
with your family
this whole time?

01:04.860 --> 01:08.591
Charles was born
15 months before Jason.

01:08.630 --> 01:10.427
'Your mother and I knew he was'

01:10.470 --> 01:13.462
'troubled at an early age.‘

01:13.500 --> 01:16.628
We took him to the best doctors
and therapists we could find.

01:16.670 --> 01:17.864
What was wrong with him?

01:17.910 --> 01:19.798
They didn't know for sure

01:19.840 --> 01:22.400
'but by the time you were one'

01:22.450 --> 01:25.169
it was too dangerous
to keep him in the house

01:25.210 --> 01:27.178
we were scared for your safety

01:27.220 --> 01:29.518
so we had him institutionalized.

01:29.550 --> 01:30.847
Where?

01:30.890 --> 01:32.209
Radley.

01:33.460 --> 01:36.122
How is it possible that nobody
in this town ever mentioned him?

01:36.160 --> 01:37.422
(Kenneth)
'Nobody knew him.‘

01:37.460 --> 01:40.293
We moved here
after Charles was admitted.

01:40.330 --> 01:43.197
Your mother wanted
to be close to him.

01:43.230 --> 01:46.597
I'm so sorry, Ali.
Oh, God.

01:46.640 --> 01:51.304
- All roads lead back to Radley.
- 'I don't get it.'

01:51.340 --> 01:53.205
Why wouldn't your parents
tell you about him?

01:53.240 --> 01:54.798
Why keep him a secret?

01:54.840 --> 01:58.241
Your mother wanted to tell you,
but I thought we should wait

01:58.280 --> 01:59.838
until you got older.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.211
Why?

02:01.250 --> 02:03.684
I wanted you to have
a normal childhood.

02:03.720 --> 02:05.244
Without the distraction.

02:05.290 --> 02:08.259
Distraction? Is that what
you call your own son?

02:08.290 --> 02:10.451
He would have consumed
our lives.

02:10.490 --> 02:13.152
So you lied and told me
Charlie wasn't real.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.895
I thought I was
doing the right thing.

02:14.930 --> 02:17.922
We hoped Radley would help him.

02:17.970 --> 02:19.392
That in time, he'd get better.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.466
But instead he got worse.

02:22.510 --> 02:26.230
He's the person who set me up
for Mona's murder.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.931
He kidnapped
and tortured my friends.

02:28.980 --> 02:31.448
Charles couldn't have done that.

02:31.480 --> 02:33.573
How is your father so sure?

02:34.820 --> 02:36.481
Because Charles is dead.

02:41.220 --> 02:43.484
* Got a secret
can you keep It? *

02:43.530 --> 02:45.953
* Swear this one you'll save

02:45.990 --> 02:48.493
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

02:48.530 --> 02:51.226
* Taking this one to the grave

02:51.270 --> 02:53.761
* If I show you
that I know you *

02:53.800 --> 02:56.234
* Won't tell what I said

02:56.270 --> 03:01.378
* 'Cause two can keep a secret
if one of them is dead **

03:04.410 --> 03:06.878
He killed himself
when he was 16.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.342
He never left Radley.

03:10.990 --> 03:12.548
How did he do it?

03:14.260 --> 03:15.488
He took pills.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.454
Where did they bury him?

03:18.490 --> 03:21.220
'My dad was out of the country
when it happened.‘

03:21.260 --> 03:23.364
So my mom had him cremated.

03:24.030 --> 03:25.463
He's lying.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.398
How can you be so sure?

03:29.470 --> 03:31.404
No body, no grave, no proof.

03:31.440 --> 03:33.431
He's not lying, Hanna.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.402
He would never protect someone
who's tryin' to hurt us.

03:35.440 --> 03:36.600
Two days ago,
he said there was no

03:36.650 --> 03:38.379
Charles DiLaurentis
in your family.

03:38.410 --> 03:39.616
Why believe him now?

03:39.650 --> 03:41.447
He didn't wanna tell me
about Charles because

03:41.480 --> 03:43.846
he was ashamed
of what he did.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.448
To him, to my family.

03:45.490 --> 03:47.617
Look, A responds
to the name Charles

03:47.660 --> 03:49.685
and clearly that home movie
means a lot to him.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.379
So that's enough
reason for us to believe

03:51.430 --> 03:53.990
that your brother
might still be alive.

03:54.030 --> 03:55.759
If_ we wanna _ru|e
him out, we Just

03:55.800 --> 03:57.392
have to find proof of his death.

03:57.430 --> 03:58.692
How do we do that?

03:58.730 --> 04:00.493
We go to Radley.

04:00.540 --> 04:02.804
Someone who works there has to
know what happened to Charles.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.501
We can't go to Radley.

04:04.540 --> 04:06.679
- Why not?
- It closed down. Remember?

04:11.810 --> 04:15.746
Hey. I came as soon
as I heard about Andrew.

04:15.780 --> 04:17.611
You okay?

04:17.650 --> 04:20.687
Yeah, I'm just exhausted
and my head hurts

04:20.720 --> 04:22.483
I need to go to bed.

04:22.530 --> 04:25.658
Okay. Uh, well, your mom said
I could spend the night.

04:26.830 --> 04:28.422
I'm glad.

04:36.970 --> 04:38.369
I like it.

04:38.410 --> 04:42.039
You do? I-I'm not so sure.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.570
It's a good look for you.

04:44.350 --> 04:45.476
Thanks.

04:45.980 --> 04:47.971
[knock on door]

04:48.020 --> 04:50.909
Good morning, girls. I just got
off the phone with Dr. Sullivan

04:50.950 --> 04:53.748
and she was able to make time
to see both of you today.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.650
Dr. Sullivan is a therapist.

04:57.690 --> 05:00.488
She works with people
who've experienced trauma.

05:00.530 --> 05:02.998
I'm gonna take a shower.

05:03.030 --> 05:04.361
Sure.

05:08.370 --> 05:09.735
What was that about?

05:09.770 --> 05:12.000
[sighs]
Maybe she's not ready
to talk yet.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.838
She needs to speak to someone
about what she's been through.

05:14.880 --> 05:16.347
You can't force her to go.

05:16.380 --> 05:18.678
Well, maybe not,
but you were shooting

05:18.710 --> 05:20.348
your dad's gun
a couple of days ago

05:20.380 --> 05:22.746
so, you're going.

05:42.770 --> 05:44.658
[knock on door]

05:44.710 --> 05:45.904
Can I come in?

05:45.940 --> 05:46.907
Sure.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.849
Ah, I notice you've been

05:50.880 --> 05:52.973
taking pictures the
last couple of days.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.773
Yeah, just...feels good

05:55.820 --> 05:57.879
to focus on something
other than myself.

06:01.490 --> 06:02.718
Tanner called.

06:04.430 --> 06:05.488
Now, that Andrew

06:05.530 --> 06:06.690
has been released

06:06.730 --> 06:09.460
she's eager to meet
with you girls.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.627
I told her you need
a few more days.

06:12.900 --> 06:13.969
Thank you.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.638
Look, if you don't wanna

06:16.670 --> 06:20.106
see a professional yet,
I-I get it.

06:20.140 --> 06:21.573
But I just wanted you to know

06:21.610 --> 06:23.999
that when you
are ready to talk

06:24.050 --> 06:26.177
I'm here.

06:26.210 --> 06:29.885
I appreciate that,
but I don't need to talk

06:29.920 --> 06:30.784
about what happened.

06:30.820 --> 06:33.482
- Oh, maybe not now--
- No, not ever.

06:35.990 --> 06:38.151
I just...wanna move forward

06:38.190 --> 06:40.522
and get on with my life, okay?

06:45.800 --> 06:49.429
How about we do something?
Just the two of us.

06:49.470 --> 06:51.802
Let's go to a movie
or mini golf?

06:53.710 --> 06:55.632
Actually, I-I booked time

06:55.680 --> 06:57.671
to use the dark room at Hollis.

06:57.710 --> 07:00.019
I want to develop those photos.

07:00.050 --> 07:02.610
Um, but can I take a rain check?

07:02.650 --> 07:04.982
Sure, uh, I can drive
you to campus.

07:05.020 --> 07:06.214
Oh, you don't have to do that.

07:06.250 --> 07:07.717
But I-I don't want you
going out alone.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.456
But it's just to
the photo studio, dad.

07:10.490 --> 07:12.697
There's gonna be
plenty of people around.

07:12.730 --> 07:15.790
Okay, text me
when you get there?

07:15.830 --> 07:16.922
I will.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.562
[instrumental music]

07:28.080 --> 07:29.809
Morning, beautiful.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.909
What are you doing over there?

07:31.950 --> 07:34.043
I'm watching the cops
switch shifts.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.849
How long have you been
sitting in that chair?

07:37.890 --> 07:40.017
Long enough to see them
switch for the second time.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.779
Caleb, when my mom
invited you

07:42.830 --> 07:44.957
to spend the night,
she meant to sleep.

07:45.890 --> 07:46.993
I know.

07:48.300 --> 07:50.518
I just.. I can't.

07:50.570 --> 07:52.492
Not with what's still out there.

07:52.540 --> 07:53.689
Nothing is gonna happen to me

07:53.740 --> 07:55.662
_ with all those _
police camped outSIde.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.634
Hanna, there was a ten minute
gap between the time

07:57.670 --> 08:00.571
the first squad car left
and the other one showed up.

08:00.610 --> 08:02.749
A lot can happen in ten minutes.

08:02.780 --> 08:04.668
[sighs]
Why don't you just
come lie down?

08:04.710 --> 08:07.747
I will. I'm gonna
go talk to that cop first.

08:07.780 --> 08:09.213
I wanna see if
the other guy left early

08:09.250 --> 08:10.888
or if he showed up late.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.558
You really don't
have to do that.

08:12.590 --> 08:14.012
It'll just take a minute.

'Operator, how can I help you?‘

08:38.780 --> 08:41.772
Hi, uh, my daughter
was a patient at Radley.

08:41.820 --> 08:44.709
How can I get hold
of her medical records?

08:44.750 --> 08:47.253
'Files with patients who
transferred to another facility'

most of the others were sent'

08:49.860 --> 08:51.282
'to River Hill Davis Center.‘

08:51.330 --> 08:52.627
That's where
they're being stored?

08:52.660 --> 08:55.197
'That's where
they're being shredded.‘

08:55.230 --> 08:56.720
Thank you.

08:56.770 --> 08:59.068
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:59.100 --> 09:00.169
Are you alone?

09:00.200 --> 09:01.758
Uh, my mom just went to the bank

09:01.800 --> 09:02.960
she'll be back in a few minutes.

09:03.010 --> 09:03.965
Ah.

09:06.210 --> 09:07.677
Listen, um..

09:09.650 --> 09:11.106
...how are you doing?

09:11.150 --> 09:13.641
It's strange to be back.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.819
Everywhere I go,
everybody stares at me

09:15.850 --> 09:18.683
but nobody says anything.

09:18.720 --> 09:20.813
Well, it can be kinda
hard to know what to say.

09:22.220 --> 09:24.324
Yeah, I guess.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.089
Man, I thought
it was finally over.

09:27.230 --> 09:28.891
Now that Andrew's
been released--

09:28.930 --> 09:31.319
We're right back
to where we started.

09:31.370 --> 09:32.997
That's not true.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.860
Everybody's lookin' out
for you guys.

09:34.900 --> 09:36.959
And the police are gonna
figure out who's behind this.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.331
- You really believe that?
- I do.

09:39.370 --> 09:41.235
But you need to tell
them what you know.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.271
Every little detail can help.

09:43.310 --> 09:47.349
Oh, uh, hey, sorry, um,
I used up all the blueberries.

09:47.380 --> 09:49.348
Can you order some more?

09:49.380 --> 09:51.712
- Yeah, not a problem.
- Thanks.

09:52.420 --> 09:54.809
That's our new baker, Sabrina.

09:54.860 --> 09:57.749
She reeks of weed, but she makes
really great pastries.

09:58.730 --> 10:00.049
It's medicinal.

10:46.440 --> 10:48.374
Are you okay?

10:48.410 --> 10:49.741
Yeah.

10:51.210 --> 10:52.643
No, I'm fine.

10:56.180 --> 10:57.784
So if Charles died in Radley

10:57.820 --> 10:59.139
it would say it
in his patient file?

10:59.190 --> 11:02.182
- Yeah.
- What if he was released?

11:02.220 --> 11:03.380
It would be noted there too.

11:03.430 --> 11:06.081
So if we get that file,
we get the truth.

11:06.130 --> 11:09.019
Assuming it still exists,
it could be confetti by now.

11:09.060 --> 11:10.925
Well, we have to ﬁnd out
one way or another.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.894
I looked up the data center.
It's 20 minutes from here.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.896
We can't just walk in there
and ask for it.

11:15.940 --> 11:17.168
No, but I can ask
for mine and then

11:17.210 --> 11:19.166
we'll know
if they've been shredded.

11:19.210 --> 11:20.802
What if they haven't?

11:20.840 --> 11:23.047
Then we'll check out the place,
see how secure it is

11:23.080 --> 11:25.298
and figure out what to do next.

11:25.350 --> 11:26.942
Caleb can drive us.

11:26.980 --> 11:29.813
No, you can't tell Caleb
what we're doing.

11:29.850 --> 11:32.444
Charles had a knife
to Sara's throat, remember?

11:32.490 --> 11:33.912
I can't not to tell him.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.757
Em, he's barely left
my side ever since

11:35.790 --> 11:37.121
he found out Andrew isn't A.

11:37.160 --> 11:38.923
He's outside ta_|kin'
to Spencer's mom rIght now.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.757
Okay, and what about with Sara?

11:40.800 --> 11:41.994
I don't even know the girl.

11:42.030 --> 11:43.793
Hanna.

11:43.830 --> 11:45.969
Fine, I'll think of something.

11:51.170 --> 11:52.262
You okay?

11:52.310 --> 11:55.939
Yeah, you know, just been
on edge since we got back.

11:55.980 --> 11:58.949
Yeah, it's been
rough for me too.

11:58.980 --> 12:00.516
How about you?
Are those pills helping?

12:00.550 --> 12:04.247
Mm-hmm, no, they gave me a huge
headache, so I threw 'em out.

12:06.090 --> 12:08.888
I'm just trying to
not focus on what happened.

12:11.930 --> 12:14.319
Um, why don't we meet
at The Brew in one hour?

12:14.360 --> 12:15.793
Sounds good.

12:21.340 --> 12:24.264
[indistinct radio chatter]

12:29.010 --> 12:31.740
Hey, Aria wanted me
to pick up something for her.

[instrumental music]

[music continues]

13:20.200 --> 13:21.952
[coughing]

13:40.980 --> 13:42.880
What did you do with his ashes?

13:45.920 --> 13:48.218
Your mother scattered
them on the lake.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.425
You weren't with her?

13:52.460 --> 13:54.121
She didn't want me there.

13:56.160 --> 13:57.889
What about his funeral?

13:59.070 --> 14:01.061
We decided not to have one.

14:01.970 --> 14:04.063
What did he do to deserve that?

14:08.210 --> 14:10.144
Were you even sad when he died?

14:12.680 --> 14:15.615
To be honest, it was a relief.

14:15.650 --> 14:17.345
'We didn't have
to worry anymore.‘

14:22.120 --> 14:24.156
Well, the office manager
won't give me my file.

14:24.190 --> 14:25.589
Has to go through my doctor.

14:25.630 --> 14:27.450
Well, that must mean they
haven't been shredded yet.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.162
Okay, well, there's only
two ways into this warehouse.

14:30.200 --> 14:33.636
Front door has a security camera
and the back door's locked.

14:33.670 --> 14:34.989
What do we do now?

14:35.040 --> 14:36.359
Let's talk to Jason and Alison.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.868
Maybe they can figure out
a way to get his file.

14:41.540 --> 14:42.871
Wait.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.153
Uh, just put it
on the bottom..

15:00.430 --> 15:02.352
Put these up on the railing.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.965
I don't see
any cameras anywhere.

15:11.010 --> 15:12.534
Or people.

15:12.570 --> 15:15.038
You guys look for the file,
I'm gonna keep an eye out.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.189
[dramatic music]

15:32.590 --> 15:35.195
Did you find any Radley boxes?

15:35.230 --> 15:36.322
Not yet.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.363
I went to see
Dr. Sullivan today.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.161
You did?

15:41.200 --> 15:43.202
My mom gave me no choice.

15:44.640 --> 15:47.973
Sullivan asked if everything
was okay between the four of us.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.276
Did you say something?

15:51.410 --> 15:53.014
I might have.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.980
So is it?

15:59.590 --> 16:01.410
We'll get there.

16:06.360 --> 16:08.294
[dramatic music]

16:29.820 --> 16:31.549
(Emily)
'Aria found it.'

16:36.320 --> 16:38.629
So did he commit suicide
or was he released?

16:38.660 --> 16:40.457
I don't know.
It doesn't say, there's..

16:40.500 --> 16:43.560
There's no paperwork or entries
past his 16th birthday.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.295
What? That can't be everything.

16:45.330 --> 16:47.230
No, it's not. It's just
from ages 13 to 16.

16:47.270 --> 16:48.464
That's all I could find on him.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.559
Well, what's the last thing
written in there?

16:50.610 --> 16:52.339
Uh..

16:52.370 --> 16:55.305
His doctor recommending
an increase in his medication

16:55.340 --> 16:57.103
something called Xylotrol.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.503
It's for severe depression.

17:01.150 --> 17:03.209
Wait. Here's his visitors log.

17:03.250 --> 17:04.478
There's only two people on it.

17:04.520 --> 17:07.489
Alison's mom and someone
named Carol Ward.

17:07.520 --> 17:10.353
Carol is, um,
Alison's great aunt.

17:10.390 --> 17:12.119
Well, if she visited Charles

17:12.160 --> 17:13.422
she must know
what happened to him.

17:13.460 --> 17:15.121
- She can't help us.
- Why not?

17:15.160 --> 17:17.299
Because _she died
when we were In tenth grade.

17:18.430 --> 17:20.136
Okay, just check
the rest of these boxes.

17:20.170 --> 17:21.137
Make sure that we
haven't missed anything.

17:21.170 --> 17:22.535
[door opens]

17:23.110 --> 17:24.463
Go, go.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.152
I still don't understand
why you were there.

17:44.190 --> 17:45.418
I told you.

17:45.460 --> 17:48.156
We wanted to get
Spencer's Radley file.

17:48.200 --> 17:51.624
Oh. Thank God you're okay.

17:51.670 --> 17:53.399
What's wrong?

17:53.440 --> 17:55.260
I wanna make sure
Sara doesn't hear us.

17:55.300 --> 17:56.289
Did something happen?

17:56.340 --> 17:58.160
Well, I was, uh, on campus

17:58.210 --> 17:59.404
and I went by the photo studio

17:59.440 --> 18:00.702
and they said
you hadn't come in.

18:00.740 --> 18:03.174
Then when I came home
and you weren't here

18:03.210 --> 18:06.270
and you didn't pick up
your phone, I panicked.

18:06.310 --> 18:08.847
I-I know, my phone died
and I mixed up the dates

18:08.880 --> 18:10.313
at the studio, I..

18:10.350 --> 18:12.215
...actually booked time
for tomorrow, not today.

18:12.250 --> 18:13.410
But where were you?

18:13.460 --> 18:15.314
You_to|d me
you were gomg to The Brew.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.850
I did.

18:16.890 --> 18:18.824
And then we went
to the data center.

18:18.860 --> 18:20.725
Why? What'd you do,
follow me?

18:20.760 --> 18:23.228
No.

18:23.270 --> 18:26.421
- I put a tracker on your car.
- You did what?

18:26.470 --> 18:28.768
I looked for Sara everywhere.

18:28.800 --> 18:32.531
And I finally found her,
on our roof.

18:32.570 --> 18:34.800
What-what was she doing
on the roof?

18:34.840 --> 18:36.478
I was afraid she was gonna jump.

18:36.510 --> 18:39.877
But she was just
staring up at the slq.

18:39.910 --> 18:42.276
Said she wanted
to watch the sunset.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.481
It's my job to make sure
that you stay safe.

18:44.520 --> 18:48.149
So if you're going to Hollis
tomorrow, I'm-I'm taking you.

18:48.190 --> 18:49.612
I just said I was sorry, dad.

18:49.660 --> 18:53.528
This is not punishment,
Aria, okay?

18:54.530 --> 18:56.191
It's just the way it has to be.

18:56.230 --> 18:58.767
I need to know _
where you are at all tImes.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.233
Hanna, I'm trying
to protect you.

19:00.270 --> 19:01.760
No, I want the tracker off!

19:01.800 --> 19:04.303
The person who did this
to you is still out there.

19:04.340 --> 19:07.605
He kidnapped you once,
and he could try to do it again.

19:07.640 --> 19:10.177
Alright, look. I-I probably
should've discussed it with you.

19:10.210 --> 19:11.802
I-I know it sounds extreme

19:11.850 --> 19:14.273
but you have to understand.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.447
I spent over three weeks
not knowing where you were.

19:16.480 --> 19:19.244
Scared to death that something
terrible was happening

19:19.290 --> 19:21.918
and there was nothing
that I could do to help you.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.382
Where is Sara now?

19:23.430 --> 19:25.421
She's downstairs
watchIng teleVISIon.

19:26.830 --> 19:30.596
I think we acted too hastily
in letting her stay with us.

19:30.630 --> 19:32.427
You know, she doesn't
wanna go to therapy

19:32.470 --> 19:34.267
and we just don't have
the tools to help her.

19:34.300 --> 19:36.234
We can't send her
back to her mom's.

19:36.270 --> 19:37.464
Honey, if something
happens to her while

19:37.510 --> 19:38.829
she's here,
I'll be held responsible.

19:38.870 --> 19:41.532
I know, but nothing is
gonna happen to her, okay?

19:41.580 --> 19:43.775
I know what she's
been through. I can help her.

19:45.850 --> 19:47.408
[sighs]

19:47.450 --> 19:50.783
Honey, I don't know everything
that happened to you..

19:50.820 --> 19:52.742
...during those three weeks.

19:52.790 --> 19:55.418
But I know you still can't
sleep through the night

19:55.460 --> 19:58.520
and you jump
every time a door shuts.

19:58.560 --> 20:01.552
Sara was in there
for over two years.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.591
Neither of us can know
what she's been through

20:03.630 --> 20:06.758
or have any idea what it is
she really needs right now.

20:12.340 --> 20:14.479
[pop music on speaker]

20:21.350 --> 20:23.443

Spencen
Yes, I'm a friend of Ezra's.

20:25.020 --> 20:26.885
So you want to place
a pastry order?

20:26.920 --> 20:29.514
Um, not exactly.

20:29.560 --> 20:30.982
I, um..

20:31.030 --> 20:33.328
Sorry. Um..

20:34.560 --> 20:36.721
I don't know
if you know my story.

20:36.760 --> 20:39.320
I do. I'm really sorry
about what happened to you.

20:39.370 --> 20:41.463
Thank you, um,
it's just been

20:41.500 --> 20:42.728
it's been really hard on me

20:42.770 --> 20:44.761
since I've gotten back,
so I was..

20:44.810 --> 20:46.903
...hoping maybe you could
sell me something

20:46.940 --> 20:49.306
that would help calm my nerves.

20:49.340 --> 20:50.944
Yeah. What?

20:50.980 --> 20:53.744
Pot? Maybe some brownies?

20:53.780 --> 20:55.714
Did Ezra tell you
I could get you that?

20:55.750 --> 20:57.718
- No!
- Because I am not a dealer.

20:57.750 --> 20:59.388
No, no, no, uh, he didn't
say that you were.

20:59.420 --> 21:00.751
He said that you use it
for your migraines.

21:00.790 --> 21:03.384
- I can't sell you anything.
- I am so sorry.

21:03.430 --> 21:04.988
I should not have asked.
You don't even know me.

21:05.030 --> 21:06.486
I'm sorry.

21:06.530 --> 21:08.896
Look, I said I can't
sell you anything.

21:08.930 --> 21:12.320
I'm not opposed to sharing
a little bit of mine.

21:12.370 --> 21:13.598
I'll put together
a little package

21:13.640 --> 21:15.938
for you to pick up
tomorrow, okay?

21:15.970 --> 21:18.404
- Thank you.
- Shh.

21:51.070 --> 21:53.379
What happened? Where's Sara?

21:53.880 --> 21:55.336

[instrumental music]

22:01.880 --> 22:03.108
Whatcha lookin' at?

22:06.990 --> 22:08.810
We were so innocent back then.

22:08.860 --> 22:10.088
[scoffs]

22:10.120 --> 22:12.020
And it was all a lie.

22:12.060 --> 22:14.620
One big, disgusting lie.

22:17.030 --> 22:18.827
Are you okay?

22:18.870 --> 22:21.566
Would you be okay if
your entire life you were told

22:21.600 --> 22:24.433
something that you saw with
your own eyes wasn't real?

22:25.610 --> 22:27.669
I mean, they made me
doubt myself.

22:27.710 --> 22:31.544
I've...I've always
doubted myself.

22:31.580 --> 22:33.138
At least now we know the truth.

22:33.180 --> 22:35.114
Do we?

22:35.150 --> 22:37.141
'Cause I'm havin' a hard time
believing nobody else

22:37.180 --> 22:38.909
in this family knew
about Charles.

22:40.090 --> 22:41.751
Somebody did.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.026
This is his Radley file.

22:48.060 --> 22:49.493
The girls got it.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.390
It doesn't say
what happened to him.

22:53.030 --> 22:54.759
But Aunt Carol visited him.

22:55.700 --> 22:58.009
- Aunt Carol?
- Yeah.

22:58.040 --> 22:59.507
Many times.

23:01.740 --> 23:03.446
What is it?

23:04.910 --> 23:07.674
Last year, when I got hurt
in that elevator

23:07.720 --> 23:09.608
and I thought Wilden
was after me

23:09.650 --> 23:11.083
I needed a place to hide out.

23:11.120 --> 23:13.452
I knew nobody was living
at Aunt Carol's, so I drove up.

23:13.490 --> 23:16.653
(Jason)
But when I arrived,
someone was there.

23:19.490 --> 23:22.618
Jason? Why aren't you
at the hospital?

23:23.770 --> 23:24.919
They let me out.

23:25.870 --> 23:27.098
What are you doin'?

23:27.130 --> 23:28.893
Getting the, uh,
property ready to sell?

23:28.940 --> 23:30.737
No. I'm keeping the house.

23:30.770 --> 23:32.806
And I want it to look nice.

23:32.840 --> 23:36.628
Good, 'cause think I'd like
to stay here for a little while.

23:36.680 --> 23:39.171
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

23:39.210 --> 23:40.677
There's a plumbing issue.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.644
They had to turn
the water off inside.

23:43.690 --> 23:45.544
Well, then, I'll just
stay for tonight then.

23:45.590 --> 23:47.854
That's not a good idea.
It's a mess in there.

23:47.890 --> 23:49.187
I don't care, mom,
it's one night--

23:49.220 --> 23:50.858
I said no, Jason.

23:52.060 --> 23:54.824
I'll be done in an hour.
I'll see you at home.

23:57.970 --> 24:01.098
[rattling]

24:01.140 --> 24:02.596
Is someone in there?

24:02.640 --> 24:04.562
That's just the wind.

24:11.580 --> 24:13.741
(Jason)
And I got in my car and left.

24:13.780 --> 24:16.715
- Did you ever go back?
- No.

24:16.750 --> 24:18.718
But I always wondered
why she kept the place

24:18.750 --> 24:20.217
when no one was living there.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.559
Maybe someone was living there.

24:25.090 --> 24:26.557
Charles.

24:29.860 --> 24:31.760
I can't believe you went home.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.768
I thought maybe once my mom
got over the shock

24:33.800 --> 24:36.530
of me being back,
things would be different.

24:36.570 --> 24:39.869
- Were they?
- No.

24:39.910 --> 24:42.128
Why did you sneak out in the
middle of the night like that?

24:42.180 --> 24:44.842
I don't wanna cause any problems
between you and your mom.

24:44.880 --> 24:46.745
Did she say something
to scare you off?

24:46.780 --> 24:47.747
No.

24:47.780 --> 24:49.577
If-if you overheard anything
she said yesterday--

24:49.620 --> 24:51.247
I'm screwed up, Emily.

24:51.290 --> 24:53.588
I know it, your mom knows it..

24:53.620 --> 24:54.882
...and you do too.

24:56.290 --> 24:58.850
She's right.
I do belong in therapy.

24:58.890 --> 25:01.495
But it's not what
I wanna be doin' right now.

25:02.230 --> 25:03.925
What do you wanna do?

25:05.070 --> 25:07.061
Simple things.

25:07.100 --> 25:09.261
Take a walk on the beach.

25:09.300 --> 25:11.029
Swim in the ocean.

25:12.810 --> 25:15.973
I can't get back
the time I lost, but..

25:16.010 --> 25:18.205
I don't wanna waste any more
of it sitting in a room

25:18.250 --> 25:19.899
having someone analyze me.

25:22.750 --> 25:25.810
I don't expect anyone
to understand any of this.

25:27.050 --> 25:28.608
I do.

[cellphone ringing]

25:46.810 --> 25:48.937
[instrumental music]

26:07.830 --> 26:10.048
Doesn't look like
anybody lives here.

26:10.100 --> 26:12.091
Maybe that's what Charles
wants people to think.

26:15.100 --> 26:16.636
If he's still alive..

26:19.110 --> 26:20.566
...why would he do this?

26:21.310 --> 26:23.005
To me, to us?

26:24.110 --> 26:25.577
I wish I knew.

26:42.900 --> 26:44.868
Electricity's been turned off.

27:23.300 --> 27:25.234

[music continues]

28:16.520 --> 28:18.181
Oh, my God.

28:28.370 --> 28:29.689
Help!

28:34.280 --> 28:35.736
Help!

28:40.250 --> 28:41.717
Help!

28:45.990 --> 28:48.788
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.
It's okay. You're alright.

28:50.860 --> 28:52.225
Did you see who went
in there before me?

28:52.260 --> 28:54.148
No. I was in the other room.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.952
But whoever it was,
put a wedge in the door.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.218
That's why you got stuck.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.465
I.. I just needed
to get some air

29:00.500 --> 29:01.933
and the door wouldn't open.

29:01.970 --> 29:03.460
Just take a few deep breaths.

29:03.500 --> 29:04.933
- And you'll be fine.
- Yeah.

29:04.970 --> 29:06.460
Okay?

29:06.510 --> 29:09.070
I am.. I'm Clark, by the way.

29:11.150 --> 29:13.277
Aria. Thank you.

29:16.050 --> 29:17.540
(Hanna)
I don't understand
why your mom would keep

29:17.580 --> 29:20.788
this smelly old house
when no one's living here.

29:20.820 --> 29:23.084
It doesn't make any sense.

29:23.120 --> 29:25.281
We should check around
the property before we go.

29:26.330 --> 29:28.525
Okay. I'll check out that barn.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.027
I'll go with you.

[panﬁng]

30:00.490 --> 30:01.991
What did I do?

30:03.330 --> 30:05.195
What did you make me do?

30:09.570 --> 30:11.037
'(Hanna)
Spencer?‘

30:13.470 --> 30:15.973
What's wrong?

30:16.010 --> 30:18.808
Do you remember everything
that Charles made you do?

30:20.350 --> 30:22.113
Yeah. Don't you?

30:22.150 --> 30:23.242
No.

30:24.190 --> 30:25.817
No, not really.

30:27.090 --> 30:30.878
I, um, I-I could
barely sleep in there

30:30.930 --> 30:32.181
'cause every time
I'd fall asleep

30:32.230 --> 30:35.119
this really loud buzzer
would go off and..

30:35.160 --> 30:37.094
...one night, finally,
the buzzer didn't go off

30:37.130 --> 30:38.427
and so I fell asleep.

30:40.130 --> 30:41.859
Then when I woke up, my..

30:41.900 --> 30:45.131
...hands were completely
covered in blood.

30:46.440 --> 30:50.331
I have no idea what happened
or whose blood it was.

30:50.380 --> 30:53.349
And then the next morning
it was gone.

30:53.380 --> 30:55.644
You were sleep-deprived.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.216
You probably just imagined it.

30:57.250 --> 30:58.945
No, I..

30:58.990 --> 31:01.208
I know what I saw.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.956
The blood just wasn't on me,
it was smeared across the floor

31:03.990 --> 31:06.925
like somebody just
dragged a body out.

31:06.960 --> 31:08.655
Charles must've put
fake blood in there

31:08.700 --> 31:10.850
to make you think
you hurt one of us.

31:12.130 --> 31:14.997
It was just another
one of his mind games.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.258
But what if I really
did hurt somebody?

31:19.170 --> 31:20.262
VVho?

31:22.640 --> 31:24.471
(Sara)
We shouldn't be out here alone.

31:24.510 --> 31:27.070
(Emily)
We're together.
Nothing's gonna happen.

31:28.080 --> 31:30.116
Where are we going?

31:30.150 --> 31:32.414
It's a surprise.
You're gonna like it.

31:32.450 --> 31:34.281
Trust me.

31:34.320 --> 31:36.015
I do trust you.

31:44.700 --> 31:46.668
Wow! These are really cool.

31:46.700 --> 31:48.190
- Think so?
- Yeah.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.435
-Hmm._
- Yeah, espeCIally thIs one.

31:50.470 --> 31:53.405
Oop, no. That one doesn't work.
I, um, used a wrong filter.

31:53.440 --> 31:55.078
No, it's really good.

31:55.110 --> 31:57.533
Really good doesn't cut it
for National Geographic.

31:57.580 --> 32:00.003
- You work for them?
- No.

32:00.050 --> 32:02.075
But I hope to one day.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.109
Ooh.

32:03.150 --> 32:05.516
Now, that is a haunting image.

32:05.550 --> 32:07.415
(Aria)
'Oh, uh..'

32:07.450 --> 32:09.213
Don't really know
why I took that one.

32:09.260 --> 32:12.252
No, I love how it's framed
off center like that.

32:14.160 --> 32:17.095
You have a great eye.

32:17.130 --> 32:19.360
But you can't be afraid
to show people your work.

32:19.400 --> 32:20.321
Get some feedback.

32:20.370 --> 32:24.602
You'd be surprised
how much it could help.

32:28.740 --> 32:32.198

My dad's waiting outside.

'So this is why my mother
didn't want me to stay here.'

33:00.370 --> 33:02.133
She didn't want me to see this.

33:03.380 --> 33:06.144
Your dad said
Charles was cremated.

33:06.180 --> 33:07.499
She must've lied to him.

33:07.550 --> 33:09.074
Why would she bury him here?

33:09.120 --> 33:11.441
I guess she wanted to
keep this memorial for herself.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.446
That's why
she wouldn't sell the house.

33:15.090 --> 33:17.081
We've been
down this road before.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.485
Every time A thinks
were onto him

33:18.530 --> 33:20.088
he does something
to throw us off track.

33:20.130 --> 33:21.199
What are you saying?

33:21.230 --> 33:22.652
I'm saying
this headstone is fake.

33:22.700 --> 33:25.066
Planted here by Charles
to make us think he's dead.

33:25.100 --> 33:26.499
That's ridiculous.

33:26.530 --> 33:28.361
No, what's ridiculous
is that you think

33:28.400 --> 33:30.038
your brother's
actually buried there.

33:30.070 --> 33:32.163
- Easy, Hanna.
- No, this isn't a cemetery.

33:32.210 --> 33:35.202
And there's no casket
down there, I'll prove it.

'Hanna, what are you doing?‘

33:37.410 --> 33:38.377
Hanna, stop!

33:38.410 --> 33:41.049
That's my brother's grave,
you can't do that.

33:41.080 --> 33:43.048
- Watch me.
-Jason.

33:43.080 --> 33:46.117
No. Stop digging, it's real.

33:46.150 --> 33:48.118
The grave is real.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.116
How are you so sure?

33:50.160 --> 33:52.287
Look at the roots
wrapped around the headstone.

33:52.330 --> 33:55.151
They've been growing
that way for years.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.122
Oh, he's right.

33:58.170 --> 33:59.523
Nobody could've put this here.

34:03.670 --> 34:05.365

and anagrams.

34:23.860 --> 34:25.555
Charles is still the key
to all this.

34:25.590 --> 34:26.557
How?

34:26.590 --> 34:28.251
A is assuming his identity.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.097
He has the DiLaurentis'
home mOV|e.

34:30.130 --> 34:31.290
He had to have known Charles.

34:31.330 --> 34:33.218
Charles was institutionalized

34:33.270 --> 34:35.329
almost his entire life, Spencer.

34:35.370 --> 34:38.601
Exactly. So he must be somebody
Charles knew at Radley.

Good job.

34:51.490 --> 34:54.186
Well, the water feels so good.

- Is that a smile on your face?
- It might be.

your breath for?

looked exactly like this.

there was a dirt wall.

all over your clothes?

- What is that?
- I brought some clothes.

I could stay a while.

Because you're suffocating me.

it must've been when I was gone.

you have to protect me now

38:26.970 --> 38:29.598
but your constant need
to keep tabs on me

is making me feel like
I'm still in that bunker.

And that is not
what I need right now.

Look”

39:24.690 --> 39:26.578
...Spencer, I'm not judging.

39:26.630 --> 39:28.723
I can't even begin to imagine

39:28.760 --> 39:29.954
what you went through
down there.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.127
And I know
that coping can't be easy--

39:32.170 --> 39:33.728
That's an understatement.

39:34.670 --> 39:36.160
But when those wear off

39:36.200 --> 39:37.861
and they will..

39:37.900 --> 39:41.836
...whatever is bothering you
is still going to be there.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.438
Thanks for the talk.

39:43.480 --> 39:45.778
- Spencer.
- I can't sleep, okay?

39:46.980 --> 39:48.811
My mind won't shut off.

39:48.850 --> 39:51.546
I just, I just
want to quiet the noise.

39:52.620 --> 39:54.417
I need to quiet the noise.

40:03.600 --> 40:05.420
Where were you tonight?

40:07.100 --> 40:09.568
- Aunt Carol's.
- Carol's?

40:10.940 --> 40:11.929
Why?

40:11.970 --> 40:13.665
I thought somebody might..

40:14.940 --> 40:16.601
Never mind.

40:16.640 --> 40:19.006
You should know
why we put Charles in Radley.

40:28.590 --> 40:30.410
When you were 11 months old..

40:34.630 --> 40:36.689
...your mother was out
in the garden with Jason.

40:38.570 --> 40:40.868
I put you in your crib
to take a nap and then..

40:42.840 --> 40:44.933
...went outside_
to turn on the ng||.

40:46.240 --> 40:48.936
When I came back
I heard you screaming.

40:51.980 --> 40:53.948
I ran upstairs

40:53.980 --> 40:56.141
and found you in the tub.

40:56.180 --> 40:57.875
'The water was on..'

40:59.720 --> 41:04.521
...it was scalding hot
and rising fast and..

41:04.560 --> 41:07.120
...Charles was just
standing there

41:07.160 --> 41:08.696
watching you slip under--

41:08.730 --> 41:11.449
Stop it.
I don't wanna hear anymore.

41:12.770 --> 41:14.635
Let him rest in peace.
