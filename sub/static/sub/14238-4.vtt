00:00.977 --> 00:04.167
Why, hello.
My name is Eric Jonrosh.

00:04.925 --> 00:07.009
Tonight you will see
the fourth installment

00:07.044 --> 00:11.297
of what promises to be
the best half hour of your life.

00:11.331 --> 00:13.382
It is my masterpiece...

00:13.433 --> 00:16.184
<i>The Spoils of Babylon.</i>

00:16.219 --> 00:19.055
It's nothing short
of a masterpiece.

00:19.106 --> 00:21.374
I-- Listen, I can't say that.

00:21.408 --> 00:23.776
I can't say "masterpiece"
twice like that.

00:23.810 --> 00:27.079
Any writer worth his salt
knows you can't

00:27.114 --> 00:29.148
bunch the same word up
against the same word like that.

00:29.182 --> 00:30.750
It's not done.

00:30.784 --> 00:34.453
Could someone please get me
a glass of wine?

00:34.488 --> 00:37.006
And I'm not saying "masterpiece"
twice like that.

00:37.040 --> 00:39.842
Why, thank you, Doris.

00:39.876 --> 00:41.961
You're a breath of fresh air
I would like to kiss...

00:41.995 --> 00:45.164
Tonight is the fourth episode
of <i>The Spoils of Babylon.</i>

00:45.182 --> 00:48.050
Cynthia Morehouse and Devon
are deeply in love.

00:48.101 --> 00:50.436
But because they
are brother and sister,

00:50.470 --> 00:53.272
they cannot in good conscience
stay together.

00:53.307 --> 00:55.191
Let's watch how it plays.

00:55.225 --> 00:58.311
And now, episode four...

00:58.345 --> 01:00.513
of <i>The Spoils of Babylon.</i>

01:00.547 --> 01:03.716
I've been treated
like a heap of garbage

01:03.750 --> 01:06.419
from the moment
I've set foot on here.

01:06.453 --> 01:08.788
No one even remembers my name.

01:08.822 --> 01:12.124
They keep calling me Derek.

01:12.159 --> 01:14.327
One guy called me Lou.

01:14.361 --> 01:16.379
<i>Previously

01:16.413 --> 01:18.364
(gunshots and screaming)

01:18.382 --> 01:20.866
<i>My name is Devon Morehouse.</i>

01:20.884 --> 01:23.502
My story is an epic one.

01:23.536 --> 01:25.221
Devon, you haven't asked me
to dance all night.

01:25.255 --> 01:29.058
I want to introduce you
to the new Mrs. Devon Morehouse,

01:29.092 --> 01:31.093
Lady Anne York.

01:31.144 --> 01:32.228
Devon will be mine,

01:32.262 --> 01:33.479
and not as my brother,

01:33.513 --> 01:35.047
but as my lover.

01:35.065 --> 01:36.482
(screams)

01:36.516 --> 01:38.884
Lady Anne!
My love, she's gone.

01:38.902 --> 01:40.052
You keep the child.

01:40.070 --> 01:41.354
- What?
- You raise her.

01:41.388 --> 01:43.222
I kicked heroin.

01:43.240 --> 01:44.824
I can't kick you.

01:44.858 --> 01:47.493
I'm in love with my s--
I mean, Cynthia.

01:47.527 --> 01:49.829
- And she's in love with me.
- I forbid it.

01:49.863 --> 01:51.113
It looks like a carburetor.

01:51.164 --> 01:54.950
It will be
our gift to mankind.

01:55.001 --> 01:57.086
I'm dying, Devon.
Mama!

01:57.120 --> 01:58.754
No!

01:58.789 --> 02:02.591
This is my life,
or what remains of it.

02:15.588 --> 02:18.641

02:27.651 --> 02:30.119
Three to five months later,
they had a child,

02:30.153 --> 02:33.873
A boy named Winston.

02:33.907 --> 02:36.409
I know I've said it before,
but...

02:37.961 --> 02:40.329
the boy looks nothing like me.

02:40.380 --> 02:41.547
Don't be such a dolt.

02:41.581 --> 02:44.500

02:44.551 --> 02:47.686
We should make another.

02:47.721 --> 02:50.423
I want Winston here
to have a--

02:50.457 --> 02:52.091

02:52.125 --> 02:54.927

Oh, Chet!
(laughs)

03:03.470 --> 03:05.471
Don't be such a bore.

03:05.489 --> 03:07.490
But many couples
make love on a...

03:07.524 --> 03:10.409

11:13.744 --> 11:16.863
My 15-year-old boy
is correct.

11:16.914 --> 11:19.549
We are no longer
just a petroleum company.

11:19.583 --> 11:21.250
Our weapons and arms divisions

11:21.285 --> 11:24.453
accounted for up to 40%
of our profits last year.

11:24.487 --> 11:26.873
Hickory dickory dock.

11:26.924 --> 11:29.375
- My God.
- Guess who's here.

11:29.426 --> 11:31.210
Who is this man?
Call security!

11:31.261 --> 11:33.495
No, no, no.
That's not necessary.

11:33.513 --> 11:37.166
Winston, this is your...

11:37.184 --> 11:38.367
uncle, Devon.

11:38.402 --> 11:43.505
How dare you?

11:43.523 --> 11:45.308
Devon, you've been drinking.

11:45.342 --> 11:48.510
What a fine lot you are.

11:48.528 --> 11:50.396
Morehouse Conglomerated?

11:50.447 --> 11:54.183
Shame on you all.

11:54.201 --> 11:55.701
Devon, please, calm down.

11:55.736 --> 11:59.188
Uh, shutting down
my research institute?

11:59.206 --> 12:00.740
Oh, you mean
your underwater hangout

12:00.791 --> 12:02.325
where you and your tart
can play?

12:02.359 --> 12:04.577
That tart has a name!

12:04.628 --> 12:07.897
Dixie Melonworth.
Have some respect.

12:07.931 --> 12:10.666
- She's a person.
- She is your lover.

12:10.701 --> 12:12.885
She is
a legitimate scientist.

12:12.920 --> 12:15.504
For real, like...
Bloop, bloop, bloop.

12:15.538 --> 12:18.107
That institute
was a money drain.

12:18.141 --> 12:21.510
Our company has decided to go
in some new directions, Devon.

12:21.544 --> 12:22.845
Uh, I think
you're forgetting

12:22.879 --> 12:24.563
one small, tiny,
lile detail there, sis.

12:24.598 --> 12:27.316
I own half...

12:27.351 --> 12:29.018
(exhales)

12:29.052 --> 12:31.737
of the controlling interest
of this company.

12:31.772 --> 12:33.439
- Impossible!
- What was that?

12:33.490 --> 12:35.758
My 15-year-old boy
is right.

12:35.792 --> 12:37.460
I've been buying shares
of the company

12:37.494 --> 12:39.562
and now own 60%
of the business.

12:39.596 --> 12:42.281
You are
a minority shareholder.

12:42.332 --> 12:43.616

12:43.667 --> 12:46.285
You're not
even on the board anymore.

12:46.336 --> 12:47.503
(laughs)

12:47.537 --> 12:49.338
Winston, stop it.

12:49.373 --> 12:51.924
Cynthia...
That's not true, is it?

12:51.959 --> 12:56.379
But that research was important.
What...

12:56.413 --> 12:58.580
Wh-- How can we expand
into offshore drilling

12:58.598 --> 13:02.301
without understanding
the impact, Cynthia?

13:02.352 --> 13:04.437
We're doing this
for the world.

13:04.471 --> 13:07.589
(somber music)

13:07.607 --> 13:10.393
We didn't see
the need anymore.

13:10.427 --> 13:12.478
You have done nothing...

13:12.529 --> 13:15.064
but bring shame...

13:15.098 --> 13:17.316
to the Morehouse name.

13:17.367 --> 13:19.318
My father
had only one child.

13:19.369 --> 13:22.038
And how dare you
say his name in here?

13:22.072 --> 13:25.324
The only shame in this room
belongs to you,

13:25.375 --> 13:27.710

Winston, I want you to guide

15:31.792 --> 15:33.626
The Vietnam war
is on the horizon,

15:33.644 --> 15:37.097

for oil is growing.

15:37.131 --> 15:39.599
Morehouse must be
in the lead!

15:44.638 --> 15:47.073
Don't you fret,
mother dear.

15:47.108 --> 15:48.975
I know what to do.

Father...

health.

16:10.881 --> 16:13.516
Thank you, Winston.

16:13.551 --> 16:17.220
Darling, will you go
check on the casserole please?

16:17.271 --> 16:21.224
Of course,
my precious flower.

16:21.275 --> 16:24.894
I shall leave <i>Little Women</i>
in your safe company.

16:24.946 --> 16:27.063
You're reading it again?

16:27.114 --> 16:29.015
Louisa May is my guide
and my compass.

16:29.033 --> 16:32.068
Yes, you've mentioned.

16:32.119 --> 16:33.987
(sighs)

16:34.021 --> 16:38.858
Your sister,
that awful woman...

16:38.876 --> 16:40.827
she's tried to destroy you.

16:40.861 --> 16:44.547
I just--
I just don't understand why.

16:44.582 --> 16:48.218
I don't know.

16:49.837 --> 16:51.171
Look at them.

16:51.205 --> 16:53.473
So content.

16:53.507 --> 16:58.178
They hardly realize
the danger ahead.

16:58.212 --> 17:00.430
And it's as if...

17:00.481 --> 17:03.149
we'd only just begun
to understand the sea

17:03.184 --> 17:06.551
and all its varied creatures.

17:06.569 --> 17:07.487
(sighs)

17:07.521 --> 17:09.055
Now our research is coming

17:09.073 --> 17:11.657
to a dreadful end.

17:11.692 --> 17:14.194
With Winston at the helm,

17:14.228 --> 17:18.564
Morehouse Conglomerated
had lost its soul.

17:18.582 --> 17:22.267
And for the moment,
I had lost my soul as well.

17:23.204 --> 17:26.906
- Why?
- You're hurting me!

17:26.924 --> 17:29.959
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Dixie.

17:30.011 --> 17:32.045
It's that tyrant,
my sister.

17:32.079 --> 17:34.014
She's shutting us down.

17:34.048 --> 17:36.249
You've got to fight her.

17:36.267 --> 17:38.018
How?

17:38.052 --> 17:40.887
You once told me
you were a poet.

17:40.921 --> 17:42.472
Well, I...

17:42.523 --> 17:44.641
I mean, I-I dabble
in free verse

17:44.692 --> 17:47.694
and every form of poetry
that's ever been conceived of,

17:47.728 --> 17:50.263
and I've actually come up
with a few new ones myself.

17:50.281 --> 17:52.816
and I do it every day,
many hours a day.

17:52.867 --> 17:54.100
It's a discipline for me,

17:54.118 --> 17:56.786
but that was
a long time ago.

17:56.821 --> 17:59.372
So with poetry...

17:59.407 --> 18:01.541
you are going
to fight your sister

18:01.575 --> 18:04.661
with the power of the word.

18:04.712 --> 18:06.913
Poetry.
And novels.

18:06.947 --> 18:09.132
- Yes.
- Books about nature.

18:09.166 --> 18:10.166
Yes.

18:10.217 --> 18:12.335
- One-act plays...
- Yes.

18:12.386 --> 18:14.671
Children's books,
magazine articles.

18:14.722 --> 18:16.122
I could do it.

18:16.140 --> 18:19.642
With my writing,
I could crush Cynthia Morehouse

18:19.677 --> 18:24.431
and bring her crawling to me
for forgiveness.

18:24.465 --> 18:27.067
(whispering)
And the research institute...

18:27.101 --> 18:28.801
It will be saved.

18:28.819 --> 18:30.770
Yes.

18:30.804 --> 18:33.656
But more importantly,
I could crush her,

18:33.691 --> 18:36.309
destroy her--
she who has tried to destroy me.

18:36.327 --> 18:38.661
Oh, it's not over yet,
Cynthia!

18:38.696 --> 18:41.314
You may oversee the seventh
largest company in the world

18:41.332 --> 18:44.000
and have millions of dollars
at your disposal,

18:44.034 --> 18:46.652
but now you must face

18:46.670 --> 18:49.956
the wrath of the writer.

18:57.431 --> 18:59.665
<i>With Dr. Melon-cans
by my side,</i>

18:59.683 --> 19:01.885
<i>the words came fast.</i>

19:01.936 --> 19:05.688
<i>In 1967, I published
</i> Poems for the Forest,

19:05.723 --> 19:08.975
a defiant stance against
our industrialized world--

19:09.009 --> 19:11.177
slightly veiled,
but it was there.

19:11.212 --> 19:15.949
Several critics, including
Meredith Sennheiser, noticed it.

19:15.983 --> 19:17.367
Genius.

19:17.401 --> 19:19.819
It must have cut Cynthia
to the bone.

19:19.853 --> 19:22.238
<i>Dixie thought I could be
even more pointed,</i>

19:22.289 --> 19:23.907
<i>so I wrote my breakthrough,</i>

19:23.958 --> 19:26.859
Unto the Sea:
An Oceanographic Struggle.

19:26.877 --> 19:31.247
Sennheiser once again praised it
with his usual frothy zeal.

19:31.298 --> 19:33.166
Son of a bitch.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.868
It caught on fire,

19:34.902 --> 19:38.720
selling over a thousand copies
in the first year.

19:39.714 --> 19:43.291
<i>The world was
beginning to notice.</i>

19:43.712 --> 19:45.897
We now return
to <i>The Talc Munson Show.</i>

19:46.113 --> 19:47.380
We have a new sponsor,

19:47.414 --> 19:50.433
Bagpipes O'Toole
Scotch semi-blended.

19:50.484 --> 19:51.768
You know,
this is the only scotch

19:51.819 --> 19:54.220
you can find in a can,
everybody.

19:54.238 --> 19:57.490
Devon, tell me
about your book, <i>Unto the Sea.</i>

19:57.525 --> 20:00.076
Well, <i>Unto the Sea</i> is
a warning flare for our planet.

20:00.110 --> 20:02.862
For too long, we have let
evil corporations

20:02.896 --> 20:04.364
pollute the air we breathe,

20:04.398 --> 20:06.833
defile our land
we tread upon,

20:06.867 --> 20:08.751
and poison our oceans.

20:08.786 --> 20:11.737
Wow, sounds like
a real page-turner.

20:11.755 --> 20:13.840
Now, one of the corporations
you attack in the book

20:13.874 --> 20:15.871
is Morehouse Conglomerated.

20:15.967 --> 20:18.461
My father
and my sister and I

20:18.512 --> 20:20.450
started Morehouse
many years ago.

20:20.910 --> 20:26.081
But since then, the company's
been on a downward spiral

20:26.099 --> 20:29.051
<i>into the vast pit
of nothingness,</i>

20:29.085 --> 20:33.822
<i>where you find the very nature
of evil waiting,</i>

20:33.857 --> 20:37.092
- <i>Lurking, to ruin everything...</i>
- Oh, turn this off.

20:37.126 --> 20:38.760
He's gone mad.

20:38.795 --> 20:40.796
He's going to bring
this whole company down.

20:40.830 --> 20:43.632
Please, mother,
he's written one book.

20:43.666 --> 20:46.335
That hardly constitutes
a revolution.

20:46.369 --> 20:48.470
Karl Marx
only wrote one book.

20:48.504 --> 20:51.373
(chuckles)
Well, you know, my sweet,

20:51.407 --> 20:55.077
Marx wrote over 20 books.

20:55.111 --> 20:58.830
Chet, um, go check on dinner,
will you?

20:58.882 --> 21:01.750
<i>The nature
of a corporation is evil</i>

21:01.784 --> 21:03.168
<i>by its nature.</i>

21:03.219 --> 21:04.803
(interview continues
in background)

21:04.837 --> 21:06.471
Thank you, dear.

21:06.506 --> 21:10.792
<i>With some sprinklings
of goodness occasionally...</i>

21:10.810 --> 21:12.678
I'm telling you,

21:12.729 --> 21:14.846
People are rising up
against this war,

21:14.898 --> 21:16.481
against pollution,

21:16.516 --> 21:19.017
against everything that makes
this country great.

21:19.068 --> 21:21.436
And if Devon becomes leader
of this rabble,

21:21.470 --> 21:23.655
- he will ruin us!
- Mother, please.

21:23.690 --> 21:25.190
You're overreacting.

21:25.241 --> 21:27.642
Perhaps you're a bit jealous
of his business partner,

21:27.660 --> 21:29.978
Dixie Melonworth.

21:29.996 --> 21:32.831
How dare you?

21:32.865 --> 21:34.666
I could care less
about that tramp.

21:34.701 --> 21:36.118
She is a common whore.

21:36.152 --> 21:39.004
And if Devon won't come here,

21:39.038 --> 21:41.957
then I shall go to him.

21:41.991 --> 21:45.961
(dramatic chord)

21:47.517 --> 21:50.226
When <i>The Spoils</i> was completed,
I knew I had created

21:50.261 --> 21:52.128
something magically personal,

21:52.163 --> 21:55.598
and of a different order
than the normal miniseries.

21:55.633 --> 21:58.234
Alas, it was too good
for television,

21:58.269 --> 22:00.653
and so I locked it away.

22:01.989 --> 22:04.157
but you can't lock away
a genius.

22:04.191 --> 22:05.942
Mm.

22:05.976 --> 22:08.644
Like a drifter you lock up
in a root cellar,

22:08.662 --> 22:10.697
there's always a window
to break through

22:10.748 --> 22:15.318
or a rusty tool
to dig to freedom.

22:15.336 --> 22:18.704
So was my little drifter,
<i>The Spoils of Babylon.</i>

22:18.901 --> 22:20.901
It broke free...

22:21.265 --> 22:23.265
for all to see...

22:23.311 --> 22:24.366
almost...

22:25.320 --> 22:26.737
against my will.
