[footsteps rustling]

13:55.709 --> 13:57.002
Oh, no! Gus!

13:57.086 --> 13:58.212
[ominous music playing]

13:58.295 --> 13:59.463
[Jepperd] No, kid. Wait!

13:59.547 --> 14:01.632
-Get back here!
-[Bear] Gus, wait for us!

14:01.715 --> 14:04.260
[bridge creaking]

14:04.343 --> 14:06.679
-[Bear] No, Gus!
-[Jepperd] Whoa! Hey, kid!

14:06.762 --> 14:07.721
Wait, Gus.

14:07.805 --> 14:10.975
That's too far.
Just wait for us, okay?

14:11.559 --> 14:15.145
-Not if you keep fighting.
-[yells] Gus, get your ass back here!

14:15.229 --> 14:18.148
Do not yell at him.
Raising your voice doesn't help anything.

14:18.232 --> 14:19.567
It helps me. [yells] Gus!

14:19.650 --> 14:22.570
If you take one more step,
we're not a team anymore.

14:22.653 --> 14:24.697
-I'm not playing. Get back here!
-[beams snap]

14:24.780 --> 14:26.031
-[Gus screams]
-No!

14:27.032 --> 14:27.908
[Gus] Ah!

14:27.992 --> 14:29.243
Ah, Big Man!

14:29.326 --> 14:30.411
[Gus strains]

14:30.494 --> 14:33.122
-Hey! It won't hold you.
-Well, do you have a better idea?

14:33.205 --> 14:34.123
[Jepperd] Gus!

14:34.206 --> 14:36.750
-[rope cricking, snaps]
-Ah! [panting]

14:37.668 --> 14:38.711
Shit.

14:38.794 --> 14:39.837
[bridge creaking]

14:40.421 --> 14:41.463
[Bear] Don't let go.

14:41.547 --> 14:42.464
[Gus cries]

14:42.548 --> 14:43.883
[Jepperd] Don't move!

14:43.966 --> 14:45.050
[Bear] Hold still.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.468
[Jepperd] Hold still.

14:46.552 --> 14:47.678
[rope cricking]

-Hold on!

-Gus!
-Gus!

14:57.730 --> 14:59.440
Ah! Ah!

14:59.523 --> 15:00.941
Gus!

15:01.442 --> 15:02.276
-Gus!
-Gus!

15:03.027 --> 15:03.944
[Jepperd] Gus!

15:04.028 --> 15:06.113
[music builds to a climax, fades]

15:07.114 --> 15:09.575
[narrator]
And as time was running out for some…

15:09.658 --> 15:10.910
[light music playing]

15:10.993 --> 15:14.663
…Aimee and Wendy took advantage
of having all the time in the world.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.040
[hybrids cooing]

15:16.123 --> 15:18.876
It took years for them
to grow what would become

15:18.959 --> 15:21.754
the most important thing to both of them…

15:23.422 --> 15:24.757
the Preserve.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.509
[hybrids vocalizing]

15:27.593 --> 15:29.219
[Bobby breathing heavily]

15:29.303 --> 15:32.222
Stay still, Bobby.
We're almost ready to go to the store.

15:33.474 --> 15:34.350
Stay still.

15:35.100 --> 15:35.935
[Bobby groans]

15:36.018 --> 15:36.852
[Pigtail] Thank you.

15:37.645 --> 15:38.938
-[Bobby inhales, exhales]
-Mm-hmm?

15:39.021 --> 15:41.523
[Bobby] Yeah. [sighs]

15:41.607 --> 15:46.904
-[chuckles, snorts]
-[Bobby groans]

15:46.987 --> 15:49.031
Wait, Bobby, come back!

15:49.114 --> 15:50.491
I didn't mean it.

15:50.574 --> 15:51.575
[Bobby grunts]

15:52.701 --> 15:54.161
Bobby, come back!

15:54.662 --> 15:56.789
[Bobby shrieks, blows raspberries]

15:58.666 --> 15:59.500
[radio beeping]

15:59.583 --> 16:02.503
[man on radio]
Hello? Is anybody out there?

16:04.004 --> 16:05.965
I'm trying to reach the Preserve.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.132
Go ahead.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.885
[man on radio] Thank God.
We found a hybrid. A possum baby.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.804
But we don't know
how to take care of it.

16:11.887 --> 16:13.305
We came across your flyer.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.349
You can help us, right?

16:15.432 --> 16:18.978
I'll give you instructions of where
to leave them. Then we'll pick them up.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.146
[man on radio]
You want us to leave him? He's a baby.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.439
We can come to you.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.400
These are the rules.

16:24.483 --> 16:26.694
[man on radio] This thing
isn't gonna survive much longer.

16:26.777 --> 16:28.362
Just tell me where you are.

16:28.445 --> 16:29.655
He needs help.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.199
You can trust me.

16:33.534 --> 16:34.535
Hello?

16:34.618 --> 16:36.370
[ominous music playing]

16:38.205 --> 16:39.039
[Pigtail] Mama?

16:40.290 --> 16:42.167
Are we getting another baby?

16:45.129 --> 16:46.755
[Aimee] Too dangerous.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.095
Where's Bobby?

16:53.804 --> 16:55.014
[Pigtail] I don't know.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.558
He keeps on digging holes everywhere.

16:58.392 --> 17:00.436
He even goes outside sometimes.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.814
I asked him to.
He's helping me with a project.

17:04.398 --> 17:06.525
But I'm not allowed to go outside.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.319
Is that what's really bugging you?

17:10.696 --> 17:12.698
You know you can play with other hybrids.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.450
They're happy doing their own thing.

17:14.533 --> 17:15.826
What about Junior?

17:15.909 --> 17:18.245
He never leaves his tree anymore.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.247
He's part owl, sweetie.

17:22.541 --> 17:23.375
And Henry?

17:23.459 --> 17:25.461
He doesn't come out of his shell.

17:26.503 --> 17:27.629
He's too shy.

17:34.511 --> 17:35.679
Last I checked…

17:38.265 --> 17:40.601
you were part animal too, you know.

17:41.977 --> 17:43.479
But not like the others.

17:45.773 --> 17:48.192
You're making them too big.

17:48.275 --> 17:50.194
It needs to look more like this.

17:50.736 --> 17:51.612
Oh.

17:51.695 --> 17:53.363
Are you sure you're not full piglet?

17:54.448 --> 17:56.700
You sure are good at working with mud.

17:56.784 --> 17:57.701
[chuckles]

17:58.577 --> 18:01.163
-[Pigtail giggles]
-So you're not as animal as the rest.

18:01.872 --> 18:02.831
That's okay.

18:03.540 --> 18:05.501
Sometimes I wish I were.

18:05.584 --> 18:06.752
[Aimee] Well, I don't.

18:06.835 --> 18:09.922
I couldn't run this place
without you, Pigtail.

18:10.005 --> 18:11.840
That's because you're smart.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.884
Smarter than most humans I knew.

18:15.385 --> 18:17.012
But I'm not human either.

18:18.013 --> 18:18.889
Thank God.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.519
I didn't fit in either
when I was your age.

18:23.602 --> 18:24.812
[hopeful music playing]

18:24.895 --> 18:27.022
It wasn't until I came here,

18:27.606 --> 18:30.984
and found you, that I finally…

18:31.777 --> 18:32.778
[inhales]

18:32.861 --> 18:34.988
…learned how to just be myself.

18:35.572 --> 18:37.407
How do I learn to do that?

18:38.200 --> 18:40.577
By not thinking
there's anything wrong with you.

18:41.245 --> 18:43.622
Because you are perfect the way you are.

18:45.415 --> 18:46.959
[both giggle]

18:48.043 --> 18:49.670
[Bobby strains]

18:49.753 --> 18:51.004
Bobby, you came back!

18:52.798 --> 18:54.049
Mm-hmm.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.592
What do you have there, Bobby?

18:56.927 --> 18:58.512
[ominous music playing]

18:58.595 --> 18:59.721
Where did you find this?

19:00.806 --> 19:02.266
Mm… fence.

19:02.349 --> 19:03.976
He found it on the fence.

19:07.896 --> 19:09.064
They've found us.

[Dog barks]

19:51.565 --> 19:52.691
Where are we going?

19:54.818 --> 19:56.236
Dog, slow down!

20:00.282 --> 20:02.201
Dog! Where are you?

[sighs contently]

21:11.937 --> 21:12.980
Gus!

21:13.063 --> 21:14.773
You've gotten so tall!

21:15.649 --> 21:17.150
Oh, hang on.

21:19.444 --> 21:20.821
[Gus straining]

21:20.904 --> 21:22.739
There we go, that's better.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.162
You look tired.

21:29.246 --> 21:30.747
[Pubba] Oh, I came a long way.

21:32.499 --> 21:33.542
I've missed you.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.128
I've missed you too.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.340
I have to tell you something.

21:42.759 --> 21:45.220
And you're going to get mad.

21:45.304 --> 21:49.433
Okay, well, try me,
but we don't have a lot of time.

21:53.353 --> 21:54.688
I broke your rule.

21:55.480 --> 21:58.817
The one rule you told me
never, ever, ever to break.

21:59.901 --> 22:01.445
I crossed the fence.

22:03.405 --> 22:04.323
Yeah.

22:05.073 --> 22:06.074
Are you mad?

22:07.409 --> 22:08.327
Uh…

22:08.910 --> 22:11.538
I knew you'd cross the fence
sooner or later.

22:12.122 --> 22:13.248
You did?

22:14.499 --> 22:16.877
I just wanted you
to stay the way I remembered you.

22:17.461 --> 22:20.130
So I did the right thing?

22:21.340 --> 22:24.301
We don't always know what's right,
that's part of growing up.

22:24.885 --> 22:27.054
You just have to follow what's in here.

22:27.137 --> 22:28.805
Even when it's hard.

22:28.889 --> 22:30.766
I haven't told you the worst part yet.

22:30.849 --> 22:31.683
Tell me.

22:32.976 --> 22:36.146
I left with one of those people
you warned me about.

22:38.398 --> 22:39.232
Okay.

22:39.316 --> 22:41.485
But he's not really that bad.

22:41.568 --> 22:43.278
There's some good in him, I think.

22:43.904 --> 22:45.530
You just gotta look for it.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.617
So, um, you're learning.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.453
Human beings are complicated.

22:51.536 --> 22:55.207
-He and Bear are taking me to find Mom.
-There's a Bear too?

22:55.290 --> 22:56.583
Good. Good.

22:56.666 --> 22:59.836
They're my friends.
They're just not good at getting along.

23:00.670 --> 23:01.588
Listen to me.

23:01.671 --> 23:06.343
Now that you've left the fence,
you have to keep going. All right?

23:07.803 --> 23:09.346
You have a train to catch.

23:09.429 --> 23:12.265
But I want to stay here with you!

23:12.349 --> 23:15.268
I know you do, bud, I know.
But look, look.

23:16.186 --> 23:18.397
You have more important things to do now.

23:18.980 --> 23:21.441
It's not just about you
and me anymore, all right?

23:21.525 --> 23:25.362
There are other kids like you out there.
They're counting on you.

23:25.946 --> 23:29.658
But you have to be brave, all right?
Even when it's hard.

23:30.951 --> 23:31.827
Okay?

23:31.910 --> 23:33.245
Don't be afraid.

23:33.745 --> 23:35.247
Okay. Now come on.

23:39.751 --> 23:41.294
Let me show you.

23:44.381 --> 23:45.841
You're ready now, Gus.

23:47.634 --> 23:49.553
Just remember what I told you.

23:50.137 --> 23:51.263
Look at me, Pubba.

23:52.514 --> 23:53.807
I see you.

23:54.391 --> 23:56.643

[Pubba] He's coming, don't stop!

Don't be afraid, Gus. You're ready now.

[Jepperd] Gus!

24:45.734 --> 24:47.569

-[Pubba] You're ready now, Gus.
-[Jepperd] Sweet Tooth!

24:52.032 --> 24:53.992
[Pubba] Remember what I told you.

It's up to you, Gus. Don't give up now.

-[Bear] Get me out of this thing.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.473
I'm not afraid.

25:16.556 --> 25:18.308
Could you have gone any slower?

25:18.391 --> 25:21.144
-I didn't see you carrying him.
-[Bear] I can barely see anything.

25:21.228 --> 25:24.439
-[Jepperd] You wanted to wear the helmet.
-You wanted to wear the parachute.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.066
-Guys!
-[Jepperd] It fit me!
