00:01.201 --> 00:02.702
GILES: Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:02.735 --> 00:04.205
-What's going on?
-Get me out of here.

00:04.238 --> 00:06.206
-Call me Caleb.
-I'm Shannon.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.041
I want you to deliver
a message for me.

00:08.076 --> 00:10.278
It's for the one and only,
the original Slayer.

00:11.278 --> 00:12.413
(grunts)

00:12.445 --> 00:13.680
(yelps)

00:14.881 --> 00:18.051
Hey, got a spare bed
for a wanted fugitive?

00:18.085 --> 00:19.553
Hello, Faith.

00:19.586 --> 00:23.022
Huh. I guess "wanted"
wasn't really accurate.

00:23.056 --> 00:27.195
I have a mission
to save the world.
I don't have time for vendettas.

00:27.228 --> 00:31.231
The mission is what matters.
I think you've taught me
everything I need to know.

00:32.899 --> 00:34.402
I heard you have
something of mine.

00:34.435 --> 00:35.868
I do now.

00:35.902 --> 00:37.438
(grunting)

00:41.209 --> 00:42.942
No!

00:42.975 --> 00:45.246
-Get them out of here.
-I work in mysterious ways.

00:45.279 --> 00:46.880
(grunts)

00:49.149 --> 00:50.951
(shrieking)
BUFFY: Xander!

00:52.886 --> 00:56.356
(chattering)
GIRL: I don't wanna leave.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.591
Can we please stay?

00:58.625 --> 01:01.228
(car horns honking)
(chattering)

01:01.262 --> 01:03.764
MAN: I'll take it up there.
GIRL: Where are we going?

01:15.676 --> 01:17.811
CLEM: Hey you.
Hey.

01:17.844 --> 01:21.314
Do you believe this
meshugaas?

01:21.349 --> 01:25.152
Yeah. You'd think these
people had never seen
an apocalypse before.

01:25.186 --> 01:28.289
What about you?
You just going
for a quick spin to

01:28.322 --> 01:31.825
7-Eleven...
in Nebraska?

01:31.859 --> 01:35.628
It's gettin' bad here,
really bad.

01:35.662 --> 01:40.000
Hellmouth acting up again.
People feeling it,
getting crazier.

01:40.033 --> 01:43.503
You can't swing a cat
without hitting some
kind of demonic activity.

01:43.537 --> 01:48.542
Not that I swing cats,
or eat. Nope.
Cutting way back.

01:50.210 --> 01:52.313
Cholesterol--
Morals.

01:52.346 --> 01:56.082
I mean morals.
Right.

01:56.115 --> 01:59.019
We've seen some bad stuff
in this town before,
but, you know,

01:59.051 --> 02:03.323
this time, it's like
it just seems different,
more powerful.

02:03.356 --> 02:06.093
I don't think anyone's
gonna be able to stop it.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.295
I mean, I'm sure
you'll do fine.

02:09.330 --> 02:12.300
Complete confidence in you.
(laughs)

02:12.332 --> 02:16.370
If anyone can do it,
you can, because you rock!

02:16.403 --> 02:19.439
If you save the world,
I'll come back.
We'll have drinks.

02:19.473 --> 02:24.478
When. When, I mean.
When you save the world.

02:24.512 --> 02:28.382
It's gonna be great
with all the rocking.
(man yelling, indistinct)

02:29.383 --> 02:31.218
Maybe--

02:31.252 --> 02:34.487
Maybe you should just
get out of town this time.

02:35.989 --> 02:39.759
Yeah.
I probably should.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.663
You take care of yourself,
okay?

02:47.768 --> 02:50.170
MAN: Go!

02:50.204 --> 02:53.373
(yelling, indistinct)

02:59.012 --> 03:00.281
(theme music playing)

03:53.667 --> 03:56.704
Uh, thank you, Officer.
We appreciate your help.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.771
Oh, no. Thank you,
Inspector.

03:58.805 --> 04:00.307
We don't get a lot
of contact with Interpol,

04:00.341 --> 04:03.143
so we're happy to help you
with anything you need.

04:03.175 --> 04:06.979
-Is there anything else
we can help with?
-No. Thank you. We're fine.

04:07.014 --> 04:11.784
Right. Because--
Wait. Wh-Who are--
Who are you?

04:11.818 --> 04:13.586
I'm with the inspector.

04:14.987 --> 04:17.625
You're with the inspector.
Right.

04:17.658 --> 04:21.495
Well, we don't get a lot
of contact with Interpol, so...
Single step.

04:21.528 --> 04:25.899
Clear the sidewalk, folks.
A single step,
and it is upon us.

04:25.932 --> 04:29.870
It is nigh!
From beneath you!
A nutcase.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.774
-(blows landing)
-Ow?

04:33.807 --> 04:37.577
People are acting up,
getting nuts. Man,
you just let us know

04:37.610 --> 04:41.081
if you need help with
your guy because we are itching
to hand out some justice.

04:41.113 --> 04:45.252
-He doesn't seem like
much of a threat.
-A-And you are?

04:45.284 --> 04:50.257
Um, I think it's time
we were catching
our flight to, uh--

04:50.290 --> 04:54.862
Interpol.
Right. Okay.

04:54.894 --> 04:57.798
Good idea.
My control was fading.

04:57.831 --> 05:01.769
What's up
with those cops?
Oh, same as everyone.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.605
The Hellmouth
is active again.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.706
Come on. I wanna
get back to Xander.

05:08.875 --> 05:12.446
Who was that?
Um, I-- I don't know.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.281
Did you get
one of these yet?
No, what is that?

05:15.314 --> 05:18.651
Fugitive.
Ran to ground right here
in our own backyard.

05:18.685 --> 05:23.624
Yeah? Sounds like
a situation that needs
some justice.

05:23.656 --> 05:27.160
BUFFY: And that you should
expect to see some bruising
when you remove the bandages.

05:27.194 --> 05:30.197
Bruising around the...
area.

05:30.230 --> 05:34.233
The bone structure
and musculature
was hit pretty hard.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.838
Okay.

05:37.870 --> 05:40.874
Um, also, they said that
the meds may cause you

05:40.908 --> 05:45.812
some stomach discomfort,
so you'll have to be
careful with your diet.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.880
I can't taste anything
right now anyway.

05:47.915 --> 05:53.185
I keep waiting for my other
senses to improve 50%.

05:53.220 --> 05:56.524
And they should kick in
any day now.

05:56.557 --> 05:59.826
Well, we're looking
at a possible release
as early as tonight.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.428
Um, we're just waiting
for your labs to get back,

06:01.461 --> 06:03.997
and Dr. Kallet said that
should be a couple of hours.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.798
That's great.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.237
Okay. I think
we're all caught up then.

06:11.271 --> 06:14.007
Thank you for this.
This was, um, really
great work.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.810
Oh. I thought we were
gonn--

06:18.778 --> 06:21.380
There were gonna be
card games.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.952
Uh, no, I just--
I should really get back.

06:25.985 --> 06:30.824
I wanna get everyone started
on this. I think we're really
close to something.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.127
It's okay.

06:35.161 --> 06:36.963
It's gotta be done.

06:38.264 --> 06:40.300
And I might
see you tonight--

06:40.332 --> 06:44.170
without depth perception,
of course, but, still.

06:49.476 --> 06:52.278
So, I guess you're stuck
with me then, huh?

06:52.312 --> 06:56.415
Let's order some
cherry-flavored,
off-brand gelatin,

06:56.449 --> 06:59.487
and then I think
we'll be up for
a rousing game of--

06:59.519 --> 07:01.954
-I might need a parrot.
-Huh?

07:01.988 --> 07:05.559
Well, to go with
the eye patch. To really
complete the look.

07:05.593 --> 07:09.463
I think I still have
that costume from Halloween.
Yeah, and

07:09.497 --> 07:12.165
don't underestimate
the impact of a peg leg.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.401
Maybe the hospital
can hook you up
with a nice one.

07:14.434 --> 07:18.505
Maybe they have a two-body-
parts-for-the-price-of-one
kind of deal.

07:18.538 --> 07:20.574
Oh, you know what
the best part is?

07:20.608 --> 07:24.545
No one will ever make me
watch Jaws 3-D again.
Yeah, and...

07:25.812 --> 07:29.649
you'll never have to--
(sighing)

07:35.723 --> 07:37.124
Oh, Willow.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.194
Please don't.

07:51.971 --> 07:54.473
And so we know
that a battle is coming.

07:54.507 --> 07:56.343
Ubervamps galore.

07:56.375 --> 07:59.612
Uh, we also know
that the ubervamps
are hard to kill.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.382
Hard to kill.

08:02.415 --> 08:06.185
But I have been out
talking to some
of my old contacts,

08:06.218 --> 08:08.889
and they've provided
some surprising
bits of news.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.423
Yay for them!

08:12.091 --> 08:14.995
Um, okay. For example,
ubervamps

08:15.028 --> 08:17.497
can be staked--

08:17.531 --> 08:19.533
right through
the heart.

08:19.567 --> 08:22.970
Zing. Poof.
Just like regular vamps.

08:23.002 --> 08:24.872
Um, we didn't know this.

08:24.971 --> 08:30.076
Um, of course, these guys
have incredibly strong
sternums, so,

08:30.110 --> 08:33.046
it's a lot like driving
a wooden stake
through solid steel,

08:33.080 --> 08:35.849
but you guys are all
super-strong, right?

08:35.883 --> 08:37.884
Um, no.

08:37.918 --> 08:40.553
Right. Okay. Um--

08:40.587 --> 08:44.758
But, still, uh,
heart information,
still good to know

08:44.792 --> 08:48.861
since holy water seems
to run off these guys like
they've been Scotchgarded.

08:48.895 --> 08:51.764
Um, and, well, sunlight
would work, but guess what?

08:51.798 --> 08:54.701
They're not coming out
during the daytime.

08:54.735 --> 08:57.738
Uh, also, beware
of their teeth

08:57.770 --> 09:01.674
and the claws they use
to shred flesh.

09:01.708 --> 09:07.279
Okay. You know what?
I used to be really
afraid of these ubervamp guys.

09:07.379 --> 09:11.585
But then the scary preacher
blew into town, and now
I'm mostly terrified of him.

09:11.619 --> 09:14.621
Right. Well, um,
we're working

09:14.654 --> 09:17.289
on getting info
on that guy.

09:17.323 --> 09:21.928
Why bother?
Nothing works.
Nothing will.

09:25.666 --> 09:28.936
Okay. I know
you're all upset,

09:28.969 --> 09:32.038
and I, myself, would
much rather be sitting

09:32.072 --> 09:34.441
at the bedside of
my one-eyed ex-fiancÃ©

09:34.474 --> 09:36.408
than killing time
here with you people

09:36.442 --> 09:40.246
in this overcrowded, and,
might I add, increasingly
ripe-smelling basement.

09:40.279 --> 09:45.118
And I would be, too, if not for
a certain awkward discussion
he and I recently had

09:45.152 --> 09:47.586
right over there
on that cot, immediately
following some

09:47.620 --> 09:49.789
exciting and unexpected
breakup sex.

09:49.822 --> 09:53.961
But I need to
give him some space.
(murmuring)

09:53.994 --> 09:57.129
So, I'm doing what
I can do, contributing
any way I can,

09:57.163 --> 10:00.232
and so will
all of you.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.168
You still need to know
this information.

10:02.201 --> 10:05.673
We can't stop just because
something else is trying
to kill you too.

10:08.875 --> 10:10.878
(sighs)

10:12.879 --> 10:14.981
Got enough to share?

10:15.014 --> 10:17.484
I'll trade you for
a carton of cigarettes
and some soap.

10:20.452 --> 10:22.054
Sorry. Have it.

10:23.823 --> 10:25.958
Hey, shouldn't you
be down at Hogwarts?

10:27.827 --> 10:29.797
Probably.

10:29.830 --> 10:33.332
All right. Playing hooky.
Score one for the boarding
school brat.

10:33.365 --> 10:37.336
Anya's techniques are
probably a little different
than what you're used to.

10:37.370 --> 10:40.307
Do you think there are
gonna be questions about
her sex life on the test?

10:40.340 --> 10:43.610
'Cause I really hope
I don't have to study
all that.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.846
Yeah. Whenever she starts
talking about getting all
sweaty with Xander like that,

10:46.879 --> 10:48.480
I just remind her
I had him first.

10:48.514 --> 10:50.283
Shuts her
right the hell up.

10:50.317 --> 10:54.687
Thing is, what's the point?
Studying demon hot zones
and pressure points

10:54.721 --> 10:57.456
doesn't do a hell
of a lot of good when
preacher man's out there,

10:57.490 --> 10:59.692
ready to finish
the job he started.

10:59.726 --> 11:03.663
-No one's come up with
any info on Caleb yet?
-No. Nothing is working--

11:03.697 --> 11:05.999
Not research,
not Anya's contacts.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.735
We're lousy with dead-ends
around here.

11:07.768 --> 11:10.403
Everyone's feeling
pretty pointless.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.039
We don't even
have a place to start.

11:13.072 --> 11:14.908
BUFFY: Hey, who's here?

11:16.375 --> 11:19.379
Hey. Buffy,
how's Xander?

11:20.748 --> 11:22.514
He's... doing really well.

11:22.548 --> 11:24.951
He's, uh, ready
to come home, I think.

11:26.552 --> 11:28.187
What you got?

11:28.221 --> 11:31.024
Info that Giles and Willow
were able to pull off
the police database.

11:31.057 --> 11:35.028
We figured with Caleb's,
you know, overt
religiosity thing,

11:35.062 --> 11:36.562
we wanna learn more
about him.

11:36.596 --> 11:38.331
Let's find out
where he's been.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.600
"Incidents of Violence
and Vandalism Connected

11:40.633 --> 11:44.171
to California
Religious Institutions
in the Last 10 Years."

11:44.203 --> 11:47.573
Looks like this gives us
a place to start.

11:47.606 --> 11:51.244
Yeah, I figured we'd start
with California. If we
don't find anything there,

11:51.278 --> 11:53.013
then we'll expand the search.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.014
But a guy like Caleb
didn't just get
in the game.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.517
He's been playing for a while,
and I want to know where.

11:57.549 --> 12:00.220
Whatever it takes.
You good to help?

12:00.253 --> 12:04.124
Well, I was gonna do
lots and lots of homework,
but, darn the luck,

12:04.157 --> 12:08.461
they went and canceled
school, so it looks like
I got the time.

12:08.495 --> 12:09.763
Good.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.201
Hey, Buffy?

12:15.235 --> 12:19.639
How was Xander's mood,
uh, you know, exactly?

12:19.672 --> 12:23.043
And did you get a chance
to talk to the doctor
about the meds?

12:23.076 --> 12:25.312
Uh, because it seemed like--
FAITH: Hey, pip-squeak.

12:25.345 --> 12:29.917
Why don't you go and get
some of the stuff you've
already gotten from Giles.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.751
Or, um, you know,
we can talk about this
later maybe.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.086
Okay.

12:36.288 --> 12:38.524
Yeah. I'll be right back.

12:40.293 --> 12:43.996
Try to find anything
that looks like Caleb--
his church, his ring.

12:44.030 --> 12:46.633
His ability to render
a Slayer useless
in just one punch.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.504
I didn't-- Uh--

12:52.538 --> 12:54.474
That was stupid.
I don't know why
I said that.

12:55.508 --> 12:58.644
Uh, it's okay.
Um, you know, I-I--

12:58.677 --> 13:02.581
I have to go to the school,
pick up, uh,
the rest of my stuff.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.183
I really didn't mean--
It's fine.

13:04.216 --> 13:06.285
Really, it's fine.

13:06.318 --> 13:09.188
Don't worry about it.

13:10.823 --> 13:15.461
Hey, uh, isn't Anya
doing that thing
for you guys today?

13:15.495 --> 13:18.697
Yeah. We were.

13:18.730 --> 13:20.868
We probably should
head down there now.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.003
Okay. I'll be back soon.

13:30.878 --> 13:34.746
-See that everyone else
gets started on this.
-Yeah.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.352
(sighs)

14:35.741 --> 14:38.077
CALEB: Oh, now, look.

14:38.110 --> 14:42.115
Things don't go
exactly your way, so
here come the waterworks.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.385
Ain't that just
like a woman.

14:55.461 --> 14:56.863
Get out of here.
Now, now,

14:56.895 --> 14:59.198
little girl, manners.

14:59.231 --> 15:02.101
I do imagine that firebrand
tongue of yours has inflamed
many a man,

15:02.134 --> 15:04.004
weak as they are.

15:05.337 --> 15:08.140
This here is a, uh,
public school, ain't it?

15:09.275 --> 15:10.409
Kind of deserted.

15:10.442 --> 15:13.379
Only just, I suppose.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.881
Folks work so hard
at keepin' the Lord out,

15:15.914 --> 15:17.817
look what happens
in return.

15:17.850 --> 15:20.552
He abandons you.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.155
Not that he could
do you much good now,
anyway.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.524
Uh-uh-uh.

15:25.993 --> 15:29.062
Wouldn't do that,
were I you, sweet pea.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.663
Fighting back didn't
do you much good last time,
did it?

15:33.633 --> 15:35.934
And how is poor,
sweet Xander?

15:35.969 --> 15:38.238
Let him know he's
in my prayers.

15:38.270 --> 15:41.673
And any time he's willing,
I'm ready to--
(makes sputtering noise)

15:41.707 --> 15:45.979
finish the job.
Go near Xander again,
and I will end you!

15:50.984 --> 15:53.186
Mind your manners.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.655
I do believe
I did warn you once.

15:56.688 --> 16:01.094
(scoffs)
You're angry,
frustrated, scared.

16:01.128 --> 16:04.464
I like that in a girl.

16:04.496 --> 16:08.000
You really should
relax a little.

16:08.034 --> 16:10.269
Look at where
you are.

16:10.302 --> 16:13.373
History's gonna look
back at you, at me,
at this place,

16:13.405 --> 16:16.708
and they're gonna
see the glory.

16:16.743 --> 16:19.979
Great things
are happenin' now,
right here.

16:20.013 --> 16:23.682
This school, the seal,
it's all gonna be part
of the great

16:23.716 --> 16:26.686
sweeping tide of change,
and you're gonna
be a part of it!

16:27.919 --> 16:29.822
Now, why would you
wanna miss that?

16:29.855 --> 16:33.692
More importantly,
why would you want
to get in its way?

16:35.062 --> 16:37.563
I guess I'm just
ornery.

16:39.932 --> 16:43.202
(laughs)
Oh, I knew you'd be
a wild one.

16:43.235 --> 16:45.538
(grunts, groans)

16:47.106 --> 16:49.475
(grunts, laughs)

16:49.509 --> 16:52.845
(groaning)

16:54.413 --> 16:58.051
I'm gonna take
such sweet pleasure
in taming you.

16:58.085 --> 17:00.120
(gags, groans)

17:10.096 --> 17:11.931
I'll see you soon,
little lady.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.573
DAWN: Okay, well, here's
the one that stood out.

17:20.606 --> 17:23.608
It's, um, a mission
up north in Gilroy.

17:25.112 --> 17:27.680
Um, Mr. Giles?
Faith stole the last

17:27.713 --> 17:30.717
meatball-mozzarella-flavored
Hot Pocket
out of the freezer,

17:30.750 --> 17:32.118
even though I had
called dibs on it.

17:32.152 --> 17:35.954
I don't see anything.
Exactly.
No vandalism at all.

17:35.988 --> 17:38.023
Then why is it
in the file?

17:38.057 --> 17:42.095
The place was abandoned.
Locals started noticing
after a few days

17:42.128 --> 17:43.730
that no one was going
in or out.

17:43.762 --> 17:46.965
Six members of the order
lived there, but when
the cops showed up,

17:46.999 --> 17:48.800
all gone, unsolved.

17:48.835 --> 17:53.905
Yup, see. The Post-it's
still here: "Andrew's.
Please do not eat."

17:53.940 --> 17:55.275
But the box
is empty now.

17:55.307 --> 17:59.546
GILES: Oh.
Oh? Oh, good?

17:59.578 --> 18:01.913
I'm not sure.
Here.

18:08.355 --> 18:11.723
See, it's not
the Hot Pocket
itself,

18:11.758 --> 18:14.993
even though it did
have that new-and-improved
thicker tomato sauce.

18:15.027 --> 18:17.829
It's just the fundamental
lack of respect.
Shut up. Pay attention.

18:20.767 --> 18:24.136
Dawn, what do you see?
(sighs)
What am I looking for?

18:24.171 --> 18:27.273
On the back wall.
Uh, knothole.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.912
-That's not a knothole.
-Amanda?

18:32.944 --> 18:34.881
Would you go down
to the basement
and get Spike?

18:38.451 --> 18:42.355
Maybe this'll help,
if this does bring us
closer to Caleb.

18:42.388 --> 18:44.656
Sounded like
there was news.

18:47.026 --> 18:49.328
What's up, Rupert?

18:50.730 --> 18:53.165
Spike, I have
a mission for you.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.335
Oh, really?
'Cause, you know,
sometimes our missions

18:55.367 --> 18:59.506
end up with you
trying to kill me--
I'm not fond of those.

18:59.538 --> 19:03.843
This is bona fide,
with real ramifications.

19:03.875 --> 19:06.512
Take a look at this.

19:10.016 --> 19:12.184
SPIKE: Looks like our boy's
been here.

19:12.219 --> 19:15.321
-You wanna go check it out?
-I need someone who can
take care of themselves

19:15.355 --> 19:18.657
in case Caleb is...
after some souvenirs.

19:21.560 --> 19:24.497
(sighs)
Are we gonna get to
the food-stealing issue soon?

19:24.530 --> 19:26.232
-Take Andrew.
-SPIKE: What?
-What?

19:26.266 --> 19:28.800
Well, you are always
saying you wanna get
out of the house more.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.971
-Yeah, but--
-Well, there may
be demons, lurking about.

19:32.003 --> 19:34.906
You never know. He's
a demon expert. He can help.
Oh, please.

19:34.941 --> 19:38.677
Well, he could bring
his pan-flute thing
along.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.346
Excellent. Off you go.

19:43.282 --> 19:46.385
So, see?
That's something, right?

19:46.419 --> 19:49.489
We'll have
some news soon.
Sure.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.990
Maybe that'll
get us somewhere.

19:52.023 --> 19:54.426
(sighs)
Maybe.

19:54.461 --> 19:58.330
In the meantime, the troops here
gotta sit and stew, feeling
crappier by the minute.

19:58.365 --> 20:01.567
We should keep them
occupied.

20:01.601 --> 20:05.938
Yeah. I know how
to keep 'em occupied.

20:05.971 --> 20:08.173
(alternative rock)
* Liv-ing

20:08.207 --> 20:11.344
* On a wing and a prayer

20:11.377 --> 20:14.381
* Out on the strip

20:14.413 --> 20:17.048
* Nobody cares

20:17.083 --> 20:19.519
* Scabbing off
a Valley chick *

20:19.551 --> 20:22.355
* Sleeping on
the practice room floor *

20:22.388 --> 20:25.291
So, what kind of band
plays during an apocalypse?

20:25.325 --> 20:28.027
I think this band
might actually be
one of the signs.

20:28.059 --> 20:31.029
* Rock City blues

20:31.063 --> 20:33.164
* You gotta pay your dues

20:34.467 --> 20:36.935
Hey. Guys,
how's it...

20:41.508 --> 20:42.608
going?

20:42.642 --> 20:46.346
Buffy. Are you hurt?

20:48.414 --> 20:52.484
Oh. Caleb came back
looking for seconds.

20:52.519 --> 20:54.320
My God, is he--

20:54.354 --> 20:56.888
Still able to make me see
cartoon birdies
all around my head?

20:56.923 --> 20:59.157
You betcha.

20:59.191 --> 21:02.894
The short lack of
consciousness was nice.
I feel rested.

21:02.929 --> 21:05.263
(sighs)

21:05.298 --> 21:08.800
So, how did those
police files work out?
Were they helpful?

21:08.835 --> 21:13.839
Uh, uh, yes.
Very much so, I think.

21:13.873 --> 21:18.810
Um, th-there's evidence
that Caleb may have established
a foothold up north.

21:18.845 --> 21:23.650
That's great. That's--
I, um, I sent
Spike to look into it.

21:25.684 --> 21:26.719
Spike?

21:29.154 --> 21:32.191
Is this a mission
from which you intend
Spike to return alive?

21:32.223 --> 21:36.663
Yes. I sent Andrew
with him.

21:36.695 --> 21:39.499
Again,
I ask the question.

21:40.666 --> 21:43.536
Buffy,
you weren't here.

21:43.569 --> 21:46.271
Decisions have to be made
in your absence.

21:46.305 --> 21:49.107
Yeah, well, those
are the ones that have
been scaring me.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.042
-I did what I thought
was right.
-You sent away

21:51.076 --> 21:53.613
the one person
that's been watching
my back, again.

21:53.645 --> 21:57.115
We're all watching
your back.

21:57.148 --> 22:00.386
Funny, that's not
really what it feels like.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.689
Buffy.
Where did everybody go?

22:02.721 --> 22:06.224
What?
Faith, the girls,
where are they?

22:06.258 --> 22:11.196
Um, Faith thought that
the girls could do

22:11.230 --> 22:13.900
with some time off
their studies.
I thought--

22:16.035 --> 22:18.170
She took them
to The Bronze.

22:28.748 --> 22:30.348
CALEB: You know what I
figured out tonight?

22:30.383 --> 22:34.487
Every high school
in this country,
from one end to the other,

22:34.520 --> 22:37.423
smells exactly alike.

22:37.457 --> 22:40.527
Now, why do you suppose
that is?

22:40.559 --> 22:45.397
And how was our best girl?
They always think
they should put up a fight.

22:45.432 --> 22:48.034
Did you lay
the proper groundwork?
That I did.

22:48.067 --> 22:50.737
Reckon she got the message,
even if she doesn't
know it yet.

22:50.769 --> 22:54.339
So, now, the big,
strong Slayer
goes back to those girls--

22:54.373 --> 22:57.676
She's just so ready
to walk them
right into it,

22:57.710 --> 23:02.548
and all we have to do
is give her that one,
final, gentle nudge.

23:02.582 --> 23:04.115
Excellent.

23:04.150 --> 23:06.285
* No

23:06.317 --> 23:08.454
This is so cool.
* Don't want a boyfriend

23:08.488 --> 23:12.959
Buffy would never
let us do this.
You are so cool.

23:12.991 --> 23:15.795
This woman is so cool.

23:15.827 --> 23:19.097
-(laughs)
-Hey, hey, how old are you?

23:19.131 --> 23:21.099
17.

23:21.133 --> 23:23.603
Yeah, we're gonna
get you a real nice
7 Up, okay?

23:23.635 --> 23:27.440
* Someone with blood
that's cold and mean *

23:27.473 --> 23:31.210
* You want something better

23:31.242 --> 23:35.080
* Than me-e-e

23:35.114 --> 23:37.249
* Me-e-e

23:37.282 --> 23:40.419
Hey! I was wondering
what was taking you boys
so long. Where you been?

23:40.452 --> 23:42.253
We're gonna have
to ask you to come
with us, miss.

23:42.288 --> 23:46.057
-Outstanding warrants.
-Yeah, or we could try
this one on instead.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.993
How 'bout you guys
buy me another drink,

23:48.027 --> 23:50.261
and we'll see where
the evening takes us?

23:50.296 --> 23:52.298
-Come on!
-Hey!

23:52.330 --> 23:54.767
-OFFICER: Let's go.
-What's going on?
-FAITH: It's cool. I got it.

23:54.800 --> 23:58.003
It's nothin'.
Get off me!

23:58.037 --> 23:59.872
-Get back.
-Get off of me.
-Shut up.

24:00.772 --> 24:02.374
(grunting)

24:04.510 --> 24:05.944
(Faith shouts,
indistinct)

24:09.481 --> 24:12.317
I'll tell you right now.
I'm not going back to jail.
(grunts)

24:14.886 --> 24:17.789
Who said anything
about jail?
(guns cock)

24:29.167 --> 24:31.069
-(grunts)
-(groans)

24:37.476 --> 24:39.811
Stay back.
This doesn't concern you.

24:39.846 --> 24:43.348
You can't keep us in here.
It'll be over
before you know it.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.592
-(groans)
-(groans)

24:54.093 --> 24:56.895
Trust me. The best
thing you can do
is wait here.

24:56.929 --> 24:59.798
Don't listen to him.
He won't hurt us.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.834
You know what?
I'm just gonna go
borrow the phone.

25:03.068 --> 25:05.571
-(screaming)
-MAN: Hey! Hey!

25:07.272 --> 25:11.877
The best thing
you can do is wait...
here.

25:16.082 --> 25:18.585
(grunts, yells)

25:18.617 --> 25:21.019
You're gonna have
to shoot us all
to stop us.

25:21.053 --> 25:24.590
-It doesn't really bother me.
-RONA: These cops are really
gettin' Hellmouthed.

25:26.092 --> 25:28.027
-Back up.
-No.

25:28.059 --> 25:29.729
What?
(groans)

25:56.288 --> 26:00.226
Faith! What are you doing?

26:00.259 --> 26:03.095
Just blowin' off steam.
Well, it started that way.

26:03.128 --> 26:04.931
It turned when the cops
went evil on us.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.971
Girls, go home.

26:13.138 --> 26:15.106
I need to talk
to Faith for a minute.

26:15.141 --> 26:17.042
-Buffy, we weren't--
-Dawn!

26:17.076 --> 26:19.345
You, too. Go.

26:21.780 --> 26:23.849
(girls chattering)

26:27.286 --> 26:31.089
What is this?
They needed a break,
all right?

26:31.123 --> 26:33.826
They've been runnin'
themselves into the ground.
Things just got out of hand.

26:33.859 --> 26:37.163
Taking a break is one thing.
I get blowing off steam.

26:37.195 --> 26:40.266
But they were fighting,
and those girls
were drunk.

26:40.298 --> 26:43.501
What were you thinking?
It seemed like
a good idea at the time.

26:43.535 --> 26:46.972
Yeah, what if someone
had gotten hurt?
They didn't.

26:47.006 --> 26:49.240
Faith, I need to know
that these girls
are gonna be safe

26:49.275 --> 26:52.778
when I'm not around.
No one got hurt, B. You
don't even know these girls.

26:52.811 --> 26:55.013
Maybe you should have
a little more
confidence in them.

26:55.047 --> 26:57.650
Let 'em mess up, sometimes,
you know, get down and dirty.

26:57.683 --> 27:01.586
How are they gonna learn?
Learning from your mistakes
is one thing,

27:01.619 --> 27:03.990
but you don't
throw children--
They're not children.

27:05.825 --> 27:07.526
That really isn't
the point.

27:09.194 --> 27:10.829
Hey, what about
the vineyard?

27:13.164 --> 27:14.701
What?

27:14.733 --> 27:17.002
How safe were they
when you dragged them off
to meet Caleb?

27:17.036 --> 27:19.337
How safe was Rona
or Amanda or Molly?

27:19.371 --> 27:21.073
(grunts)

27:32.651 --> 27:36.188
ANDREW: You sure you don't
wanna stop and pick up
some burgers or something,

27:36.221 --> 27:38.490
you know,
road trip food?

27:38.523 --> 27:41.861
It's not a road trip.
It's a covert operation.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.895
Right, right.
Gotcha.

27:46.265 --> 27:50.068
I bet even covert
operatives eat curly fries.
They're really good.

27:52.270 --> 27:54.640
Not as good as those
onion blossom things.

27:54.673 --> 27:57.175
Ooh, I love those.
Yeah, me, too.

27:58.576 --> 28:00.645
It's an onion,
and it's a flower.

28:00.679 --> 28:03.715
I-I don't understand
how such a thing
is possible.

28:03.750 --> 28:06.986
Well, you see, the genius
of it is, you soak it
in ice water for an hour,

28:07.019 --> 28:08.554
so it holds its shape.

28:08.586 --> 28:11.790
Then you deep-fry it
root-side up for about
five minutes.

28:12.791 --> 28:15.227
Masterful.
Yeah.

28:17.797 --> 28:20.298
Tell anyone we had
this conversation,
I'll bite you.

28:21.299 --> 28:22.601
Right.

28:31.277 --> 28:33.244
The big meeting
hasn't started yet,
has it?

28:33.278 --> 28:35.547
God, I hope so.

28:35.580 --> 28:36.915
Faith.

28:38.250 --> 28:41.487
You must be Principal Wood.
Heard a lot about you.

28:44.123 --> 28:48.626
It hasn't really
started yet, has it?
'Cause I hate being late.

28:48.660 --> 28:51.462
The troops are
still gathering.
I think you're safe.

28:54.333 --> 28:57.603
Looks like someone
banged you up
pretty well.

28:57.635 --> 29:00.940
Yeah, cops... mostly.

29:00.972 --> 29:05.711
-Mostly?
-Yeah, this one's from someone
who just thinks she's a cop.

29:05.743 --> 29:09.080
It's my favorite
of all my current bruises.

29:09.115 --> 29:12.284
So, someone who thinks
she's a cop, huh?

29:12.317 --> 29:15.753
You gonna have to, like,
ice her now, or something
like that?

29:15.855 --> 29:17.655
I'm not gonna kill her.

29:17.689 --> 29:22.461
Wanted to, but didn't.
And, by the way, bully for me,
since no one else said it.

29:22.493 --> 29:24.329
For what?
For not killing Buffy?

29:24.363 --> 29:26.664
It's this new thing
I'm trying.

29:27.834 --> 29:29.935
She told me about you.

29:29.969 --> 29:34.105
Believe every word.
So, what changed?

29:34.140 --> 29:36.976
I mean, why didn't you
fight back?

29:38.944 --> 29:41.180
Other things matter more.

29:42.381 --> 29:44.951
I think you're
worried about her.

29:44.983 --> 29:47.519
I think you need
to brush up on your
Buffy and Faith history.

29:47.552 --> 29:50.655
(laughs)
All right,
if you say so,

29:50.689 --> 29:53.125
but I read people
pretty well.

29:53.159 --> 29:55.794
It's a thing I do.

29:55.827 --> 30:00.833
You don't live
around here, right?
Uh, no, not exactly.

30:00.866 --> 30:03.634
Well, it's the center
of town, really.

30:03.669 --> 30:09.275
This town, walking anywhere
after dark is like
an extreme sport.

30:09.307 --> 30:13.778
Someone who didn't know you
very well might think you
were out looking for a fight.

30:13.811 --> 30:17.348
Maybe you got bigger issues
than what's wrong with B.

30:18.384 --> 30:20.618
I read people, too.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.520
(tires skid)

30:23.521 --> 30:25.223
Xander's home.

30:35.867 --> 30:37.236
(sighs)

30:41.339 --> 30:44.410
(sighs)
No one's here.

30:44.442 --> 30:48.680
These kind of places
make me feel funny inside.
How 'bout that.

30:48.713 --> 30:51.983
You and me got
something else
in common after all.

30:52.018 --> 30:53.751
(grunts)
Spike!

31:01.027 --> 31:02.094
(grunts)

31:04.963 --> 31:06.597
(moaning)

31:15.740 --> 31:17.875
(door opens)

31:21.113 --> 31:23.015
XANDER: Oh, god.

31:23.048 --> 31:27.553
We didn't have time to do
more. You have to pretend
there's a big party here.

31:34.726 --> 31:39.965
That's fine. Parties in
this house, I usually end
up having to rebuild something.

31:39.999 --> 31:41.500
(laughter)

31:44.802 --> 31:49.075
Welcome home, Xander.
I wanted you to be here
for this.

31:49.107 --> 31:51.777
I think you'll be
interested in what
I found out.

31:51.809 --> 31:55.547
Wh-What did you
find out?
It's about the cellar.

31:55.580 --> 32:00.786
Look, I know that night
wasn't fun for any of us,

32:00.818 --> 32:02.854
but I figured out
some things about
that place,

32:02.954 --> 32:05.590
and I realize now
what we have to do.

32:06.657 --> 32:09.194
We're going back in.

32:21.039 --> 32:22.607
Tell me about the mark.

32:22.641 --> 32:26.478
(moans)
Hey. Are you part
of Caleb's faction?

32:26.511 --> 32:29.515
-No, no.
-Then tell me what happened.

32:29.548 --> 32:33.618
-I-I-I can't.
-"Can't" is
a four-letter word.

32:33.652 --> 32:37.756
I'm Andrew. I'll be
your bad cop this evening.

32:37.788 --> 32:40.959
You don't start singing,
my associate here--
We're trying to fight him.

32:40.992 --> 32:43.162
Caleb. We need your help.

32:43.194 --> 32:46.664
You can't fight him.
You can't stop him.

32:46.698 --> 32:51.269
-You can only run.
-"Run" is a four-letter wor--

32:51.302 --> 32:52.503
A three-letter word.

32:54.905 --> 32:56.174
Talk.

32:59.310 --> 33:02.147
I'll do better.
I'll show you.

33:09.221 --> 33:14.160
One night, some time ago,
a man arrived at our doors.

33:15.493 --> 33:17.895
And you said,
"Come in. Do some damage"?

33:17.929 --> 33:22.401
We are-- We are
a benevolent order,
and, yes, we welcomed him.

33:22.433 --> 33:26.738
We offered to feed him,
but he had come
for something else.

33:28.773 --> 33:32.377
Behind this, he revealed
something even
we didn't know was here.

33:32.411 --> 33:34.079
A secret room.

33:34.113 --> 33:37.816
He was excited,
talking the whole time.

33:37.848 --> 33:42.854
-Destiny. That sort of thing.
-Yeah, we hear he's
a real smooth-talker.

33:42.887 --> 33:45.356
He was going on
about this ancient
inscription.

33:45.391 --> 33:47.726
Neat.

33:47.759 --> 33:50.561
He read it,
and he didn't like
what it said.

33:52.131 --> 33:56.000
His temper-- He was
the purest evil
I've ever seen.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.503
He burned his mark
upon me.

33:58.537 --> 34:02.208
And then I ran,
and I hid,

34:03.241 --> 34:05.743
and I listened
to the others die.

34:09.248 --> 34:11.916
Running away saved your life.

34:14.985 --> 34:16.755
What does it say?

34:18.489 --> 34:20.592
"It is not for thee."

34:22.427 --> 34:26.697
"It is for her alone
to wield."

34:26.731 --> 34:30.369
I know what you're thinking,
but I had a visit today
at the school from Caleb.

34:30.402 --> 34:33.371
-Buffy, wh-why didn't you--
-I'm fine.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.974
I mean, it wasn't fun,
but I'm fine.

34:36.007 --> 34:39.311
I'm better than fine.
I figured something out.

34:39.344 --> 34:41.579
He kept making
all this noise
about the school.

34:41.612 --> 34:44.583
-Is it that seal again?
-Do we need to try
shutting it again?

34:44.614 --> 34:48.853
No. That's just it.
We've spent all this time
worrying about

34:48.954 --> 34:50.755
the seal and the Hellmouth.

34:50.789 --> 34:52.489
Wh-Why isn't Caleb
guarding them?

34:52.523 --> 34:54.925
Why doesn't he have
someone there
protecting it?

34:54.960 --> 34:57.163
Why is he camped out
at the vineyard?

34:57.195 --> 34:59.664
The bad guys always go
where the power is.

34:59.697 --> 35:03.434
So, if the seal was so important
to Caleb and the First,
they would be there right now.

35:03.469 --> 35:07.505
They're protecting
the vineyard or something
at the vineyard.

35:07.539 --> 35:11.543
I say it's their power,
and I say it's time we go in
and take it away from them.

35:14.679 --> 35:19.451
Or, in the alternative,
how 'bout we don't?

35:19.485 --> 35:22.320
I mean, it's a neat theory,
B, but I'm not going
back in that place,

35:22.353 --> 35:25.623
not without proof--
and neither should you
and neither should they.

35:25.657 --> 35:29.427
-I'm not saying
it's gonna be easy.
-I think Faith had the floor.

35:29.460 --> 35:33.931
FAITH: Maybe it ends okay
the way you wanna play it,
but maybe it doesn't.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.434
And right now,
I don't think I want you
playing the odds.

35:36.467 --> 35:38.769
Did you come here to fight?

35:38.804 --> 35:41.373
Listen, we're fighters,
all of us, but you gotta
give me something to fight.

35:41.407 --> 35:44.576
-Something real, not--
-Windmills.

35:46.010 --> 35:47.512
There is something there.

35:47.545 --> 35:50.981
Maybe. W-We can't
be sure of that.

35:51.016 --> 35:53.784
Y-You-- This is
a hell of a lot to ask.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.721
Too much.

35:57.889 --> 36:00.525
I-I don't understand this.

36:00.559 --> 36:04.963
For seven years, I've
kept us safe by doing this--
exactly this.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.865
Making the hard decisions.

36:07.898 --> 36:10.802
A-A-And, now, what,
suddenly you're all acting
like you can't trust me?

36:10.835 --> 36:14.306
Didn't you say to me
today you can't trust us?

36:14.340 --> 36:17.175
I mean, maybe there's
something there that
should be addressed.

36:18.376 --> 36:19.744
Is that why
you sent Spike away,

36:19.777 --> 36:21.713
to ambush me?
Come on.

36:21.746 --> 36:25.150
You know what?
I am sick of your deal
with this Spike guy.

36:25.182 --> 36:28.853
This isn't about him.
This is about you.
You're being reckless.

36:29.954 --> 36:31.822
What?
You are!

36:31.856 --> 36:35.360
I don't even know you
and I can tell. You are so
obsessed with beating Caleb,

36:35.393 --> 36:37.262
you are willing
to jump into any plan
without thinking.

36:37.295 --> 36:41.932
This is not what I'm doing.
Well, that's how
it feels to us.

36:41.967 --> 36:43.402
People are dying.

36:43.434 --> 36:45.871
-WILLOW: Kennedy.
-Why are you always
standing up for her?

36:47.072 --> 36:48.907
I'm not.

36:48.940 --> 36:52.478
-What do you mean you're not?
-With everything
that's happened, I--

36:54.380 --> 36:55.880
I'm worried
about your judgment.

37:00.918 --> 37:04.188
Look, I wish this
could be a democracy,

37:04.222 --> 37:05.856
I really do.

37:05.891 --> 37:08.460
But democracies
don't win battles.

37:08.494 --> 37:12.097
It's a hard truth,
but there has to be
a single voice.

37:12.130 --> 37:15.900
You need someone
to issue orders
and be reckless sometimes,

37:15.934 --> 37:17.768
and not take
your feelings into account.

37:17.802 --> 37:20.405
You need someone to lead you.

37:20.438 --> 37:22.673
And it's
automatically you.

37:24.141 --> 37:26.244
You really do
think you're better
than we are.

37:26.277 --> 37:28.079
No, I--
But we don't know.

37:28.112 --> 37:31.382
We don't know
if you're actually better.

37:31.416 --> 37:34.485
I mean, you came into
the world with certain
advantages, sure.

37:34.519 --> 37:36.954
I mean,
that's the legacy.
I--

37:36.987 --> 37:40.759
But you didn't earn it.
You didn't work for it.

37:40.791 --> 37:44.094
You've never had anybody
come up to you and say that
you deserve these things

37:44.128 --> 37:46.931
more than anyone else--
They were just handed to you.

37:46.965 --> 37:50.235
So, that doesn't
make you better than us.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.771
It makes you luckier
than us.

37:54.440 --> 37:58.443
I've gotten us this far.
XANDER: But not without a price.

37:59.777 --> 38:03.280
-Xander.
-I'm trying to see
your point here, Buff.

38:03.315 --> 38:06.652
But I guess it must be
a little bit to my left,

38:06.684 --> 38:08.853
'cause I just don't.

38:08.887 --> 38:10.621
Look, I'm willing
to talk strategy. Okay?

38:10.655 --> 38:14.092
I'll hear suggestions
on how to break this down,
but this is the plan.

38:14.125 --> 38:16.961
We have to be together
on this, or we will
fail again.

38:16.994 --> 38:19.764
We are clearly demonstrating
that we are not together
on this.

38:19.797 --> 38:21.400
Which is why
you have to fall in line.

38:22.900 --> 38:24.936
I'm still in charge here.

38:24.969 --> 38:29.139
-And why is that exactly?
-Because I'm the Slayer.

38:29.173 --> 38:32.010
-And isn't Faith a Slayer, too?
-What?

38:32.043 --> 38:36.014
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
So not what I meant.
I'm not in-charge chick.

38:36.047 --> 38:38.784
I think B here
just needs to chill out

38:38.817 --> 38:40.719
for a little bit,
take a siesta or something.

38:40.751 --> 38:44.523
But I'm not the one
you want.
Maybe we need a vote...

38:44.556 --> 38:47.224
to see who wants Faith
to have a turn in charge.

38:47.257 --> 38:50.896
-No.
-No, what?

38:50.929 --> 38:54.666
No, you don't get to vote
until I've had my chance
to pal around,

38:54.699 --> 38:56.534
you know,
get everybody drunk.

38:56.568 --> 38:59.371
See, I didn't get
that this was
a popularity contest.

38:59.405 --> 39:02.641
I should have equal time
to bake them cookies,
braid their hair.

39:02.673 --> 39:04.643
Learn their names.

39:04.675 --> 39:07.646
(scoffs)
You're just lovin'
this, aren't you?

39:07.679 --> 39:09.581
-You have no idea
what I'm feeling.
-Come in here.

39:09.614 --> 39:13.251
Take everything that I have.
I mean, you did it before.
Did you tell them that?

39:13.284 --> 39:15.521
Did you tell them
how you used to kill
people for fun?

39:15.554 --> 39:17.922
-Hey, you guys think
that's nifty?
-Buffy, that's enough.

39:17.956 --> 39:20.525
FAITH: Ididn't come here
to take anything
away from you,

39:20.559 --> 39:22.827
but I'm not gonna be
your little lap dog
either.

39:22.860 --> 39:26.864
I came here to beat
the other guy. To do right,
however it works.

39:26.898 --> 39:31.436
I don't know if I can lead.
But the real question is,
can you follow?

39:33.539 --> 39:35.139
So, we vote.

39:38.543 --> 39:41.045
Wait, guys.

39:47.918 --> 39:50.755
I can't watch you
just throw away
everything that--

39:53.791 --> 39:57.762
I know I'm right about this.
I just need a little--

39:59.998 --> 40:03.501
I can't stay here
and watch her lead you
into some disaster.

40:11.342 --> 40:13.277
Then you can't stay here.

40:15.780 --> 40:18.750
Buffy, I love you,

40:19.985 --> 40:21.251
but you were right.

40:22.286 --> 40:24.355
We have to be together
on this.

40:26.492 --> 40:27.925
You can't be
a part of it.

40:31.597 --> 40:33.965
So, I need you to leave.

40:36.134 --> 40:40.438
I'm sorry,
but this is my house, too.

40:54.652 --> 40:58.856
-Ding-dong,
the witch is dead.
-Shut your mouth.

41:01.326 --> 41:05.630
(sighs)
Hey.

41:05.664 --> 41:07.998
Look, I swear, I didn't
want it to go this way.
Don't.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.467
I mean it. I--
Don't

41:10.501 --> 41:12.637
be afraid to lead them.

41:14.905 --> 41:18.643
Whether you wanted it
or not, their lives
are yours.

41:21.045 --> 41:25.684
It's only gonna get harder.
Protect them.

41:29.019 --> 41:30.722
Lead them.
