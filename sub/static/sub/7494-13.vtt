WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:02.770
Narrator: Last time on
Make it Pop

00:02.803 --> 00:04.538
If you're still looking
for a lead, it's me.

00:04.572 --> 00:07.575
Agh! The store is in a truck,
and I'm stuck in the back.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.377
Corki: My father saw
the whole thing!

00:09.410 --> 00:11.779
And I know this must be
very disappointing, but I--

00:11.812 --> 00:12.980
Mr. Chang: That
was wonderful.

00:13.013 --> 00:13.647
Incoming cast list...

00:13.681 --> 00:15.916
And I'm...
not on the list.

00:16.950 --> 00:19.153
Mr. Stark: Alright,
everybody, quickly,

00:19.187 --> 00:21.089
we're running out of time.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.291
I said places, people!

00:23.324 --> 00:26.727
Trees, shrubs and other
random foliage, upstage.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.062
Twigs and yellow bricks...

00:28.096 --> 00:30.030
To the wings.

00:30.064 --> 00:32.266
Problems, Mr. Stark?

00:32.300 --> 00:36.137
First day of rehearsal is
always a special challenge.

00:36.170 --> 00:39.407
The excitement, the
dreams, the hormones...

00:39.440 --> 00:41.142
The mayhem.

00:41.175 --> 00:44.778
They will find the play
and it will be great.

00:44.812 --> 00:45.646
Not what I meant.

00:45.679 --> 00:48.015
Last year's play was
a colossal failure.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.083
And this year...

00:49.117 --> 00:50.751
Caleb: I'm winged
monkey number seven!

00:50.784 --> 00:51.985
This is awesome...

00:52.019 --> 00:58.159
Ahhhhh.

00:58.192 --> 01:00.894
I'm okay....

01:00.928 --> 01:02.330
I'd say "break a leg"

01:02.363 --> 01:04.532
but it looks like Caleb's
got that covered.

01:04.565 --> 01:10.037
(laughing)

01:10.070 --> 01:12.039
Mr. Stark, I need
to talk to you.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.274
Can it wait?

01:13.307 --> 01:16.410
Have I ever waited for anything
as long as you've known me?

01:16.444 --> 01:17.811
I guess not.

01:17.845 --> 01:20.114
How could you
not cast this?

01:20.148 --> 01:28.055
* Maaaaaaaaakkeeee it Pop pop
pop pop pop pop pop, oh, yeah *

01:28.088 --> 01:30.891
You are one of the most talented
performers at MacKendrick.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.193
One of?

01:32.226 --> 01:35.062
Have you taken a
look around this place?

01:35.095 --> 01:41.034
I almost got it...

01:41.068 --> 01:43.237
Your performance the
other night was terrific.

01:43.271 --> 01:45.038
So why am I
not the lead?

01:45.072 --> 01:47.441
Because I couldn't reward
someone when I found out she

01:47.475 --> 01:51.445
had dyed a few of her fellow
classmates flamingo pink.

01:51.479 --> 01:52.546
What?

01:52.580 --> 01:54.448
How did you find
out about that?

01:54.482 --> 01:57.485
I'd love to help you piece
this together, Sherlock,

01:57.518 --> 02:01.054
but some of us have
play rehearsal.

02:01.088 --> 02:03.924
Kissies.

02:03.957 --> 02:08.162
Okay kissies people--
Places people.

02:09.062 --> 02:12.200
* Make it pop, woo, woo

02:12.233 --> 02:16.069
* Make it pop, woo, woo

02:16.103 --> 02:19.106
* I can't wait
no I can't wait *

02:19.139 --> 02:22.210
* No, I can't wait,
no I can't wait *

02:22.243 --> 02:25.579
* So make it pop, we're
bout to, we're bout to blow *

02:25.613 --> 02:28.949
* Wait till we drop,
Oh ya, we're ready to go *

02:28.982 --> 02:29.983
* Ain't gonna stop

02:30.017 --> 02:32.386
* When is it time
for the show *

02:32.420 --> 02:35.223
* We make it, you make
it, they make it *

02:35.256 --> 02:38.058
* M-m-m-m-m-m-
Make it pop *

02:39.627 --> 02:44.097
*

02:44.131 --> 02:45.533
She hasn't
moved in hours.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.468
Well, that's
not so unusual.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.903
She hasn't said
anything in hours either.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.939
Oh, this is serious.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.114
Ahh!!

03:01.148 --> 03:01.682
She's alive!

03:01.715 --> 03:02.650
I can't believe this!

03:02.683 --> 03:04.285
Sun Hi, it's just a play.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.486
Maybe to you, Jodi.

03:05.519 --> 03:08.956
But to me, it was another
piece of my celebrity puzzle.

03:08.989 --> 03:09.757
Be fabulous: check.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.292
Get a Nation of
followers: check.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.926
The band blows
up: check.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.362
We've performed in
front of people.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.364
I'm not sure if that's
really "blowing up?"

03:16.397 --> 03:17.665
Corki!

03:17.698 --> 03:18.666
Sorry.

03:18.699 --> 03:19.467
What now?

03:19.500 --> 03:21.435
I'm fifteen.

03:21.469 --> 03:22.536
Time is running out!

03:22.570 --> 03:23.537
Take it easy.

03:23.571 --> 03:24.738
Before your world ends

03:24.772 --> 03:27.408
you might want to read this
review of our last concert.

03:28.276 --> 03:29.643
"The pop divas
wowed the crowd

03:29.677 --> 03:31.545
with astounding vocals
and amazing moves,

03:31.579 --> 03:36.484
Singer Sun Hi Song finishes
off with a pitch-perfect solo."

03:37.985 --> 03:38.919
That's not bad.

03:38.952 --> 03:39.620
Jodi: See?

03:39.653 --> 03:41.154
And it's on the internet.

03:41.188 --> 03:42.990
Can't get any more
credible than that.

03:43.023 --> 03:45.359
Mhmm.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.997
Mr. Stark: Pay
attention!

03:50.030 --> 03:51.565
It's a house of
cards, people!

03:51.599 --> 03:53.166
Mr. Stark are
you okay?

03:53.200 --> 03:54.968
I having more trouble
controlling this group

03:55.002 --> 03:58.506
than my all-cats
production of Cats.

03:58.539 --> 04:01.174
Am I happy to be
cast as a tree?

04:01.208 --> 04:04.011
No, but am I one
to go half way?

04:04.044 --> 04:06.314
Uh-uh.

04:06.347 --> 04:10.183
Oh, for the love
of Dorothy.

04:10.217 --> 04:12.119
Caleb: I'm okay.

04:12.152 --> 04:14.021
Nice commitment.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.256
Don't you feel kind
of sorry for him?

04:16.290 --> 04:18.459
I don't think trees
display empathy.

04:18.492 --> 04:21.295
Especially not for someone who
clearly can't see real talent

04:21.329 --> 04:23.664
when it's standing
right in front of him.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.333
He needs help.

04:25.366 --> 04:28.736
Maybe from someone
who exudes leadership.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.237
Authority.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.740
Discipline.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.275
Know anyone like that?

04:35.309 --> 04:37.411
(crying)

04:37.445 --> 04:39.046
Besides me?

04:39.079 --> 04:40.213
I don't know...

04:40.247 --> 04:42.215
I mean what makes
him Oz and not...

04:42.249 --> 04:44.251
Whoever fits into that
role might find themselves

04:44.284 --> 04:47.355
indispensable to this play.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.357
Mr. Stark:
Places people,

04:49.390 --> 04:51.692
People!

04:51.725 --> 04:53.694
Corki, you're a genius!

04:53.727 --> 04:57.130
Places people, please!

04:57.164 --> 04:58.666
Places?

04:58.699 --> 05:05.238
Line up, now!

05:05.272 --> 05:07.240
You see that is the
power the quarterback,

05:07.274 --> 05:08.241
student body president,

05:08.275 --> 05:13.246
and 'would have been'
homecoming king wields.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.716
This might be
useful to me.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.451
I'll keep your
play in line

05:17.485 --> 05:20.253
but ah I'm gonna need a little
something in return.

05:20.287 --> 05:20.988
I know.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.456
You don't want
to be a tree.

05:22.490 --> 05:23.657
Nice commitment
by the way.

05:23.691 --> 05:24.558
Thanks.

05:24.592 --> 05:25.359
And no!

05:25.393 --> 05:29.196
Mr. Stark I want
creative control.

05:29.229 --> 05:30.130
Ha!

05:30.163 --> 05:31.599
Absolutely not!

05:31.632 --> 05:34.134
It takes years to
get creative control.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.204
It is earned, young
man, not given.

05:37.237 --> 05:41.208
Okay, suit yourself.

05:41.241 --> 05:43.777
As you were!

05:43.811 --> 05:45.713
Fine!

05:45.746 --> 05:49.216
You can be my...
assistant director.

05:49.249 --> 05:51.519
Your name will appear on the
playbill under mine,

05:51.552 --> 05:56.089
and in a much
smaller font.

05:56.123 --> 05:58.426
Don't push it, Jared.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.493
Got it.

05:59.527 --> 06:01.695
Deal.

06:01.729 --> 06:06.366
Places everyone.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.469
Thank you...

06:08.502 --> 06:10.303
Jared: Let's take
it from the top!

06:10.337 --> 06:12.506
Mr. Stark: Act one, or two,
it doesn't matter,

06:12.540 --> 06:14.107
we're going back to
the beginning.

06:14.141 --> 06:16.810
It doesn't feel right
without Sun Hi here.

06:16.844 --> 06:19.179
Like we've
abandoned her.

06:19.212 --> 06:19.847
Sun Hi?

06:19.880 --> 06:20.714
No way....

06:20.748 --> 06:22.516
For her it doesn't get
any better than

06:22.550 --> 06:24.084
Reading great reviews
about herself

06:25.653 --> 06:33.160
* Everybody's searching
for the same light *

06:33.193 --> 06:40.434
* Wishing on a dream
inside their hearts *

06:40.468 --> 06:46.674
* Let's go, let's find a
spark we can ignite *

06:46.707 --> 06:56.283
* Together, together

06:56.316 --> 07:06.326
*

07:06.359 --> 07:12.199
*

07:12.232 --> 07:16.670
* All around the world
people lookin for love *

07:16.704 --> 07:20.140
* All around the world,
all around the world *

07:20.173 --> 07:21.909
* All around the
world *

07:21.942 --> 07:27.314
* Looking for love,
looking for love *

07:27.347 --> 07:35.556
* So many of us wanna
make a difference *

07:35.589 --> 07:43.296
* United we can
turn it all around *

07:43.330 --> 07:49.537
* We need to feed the
flame and make it stronger *

07:49.570 --> 07:59.813
* Together, together

07:59.847 --> 08:08.221
* Wherever we go, whatever
we dream, it's somewhere *

08:08.255 --> 08:15.629
* We're hoping to find, we know
in our minds, it's out there *

08:15.663 --> 08:23.270
* Ooooh ooooh Ooooh ooooh

08:23.303 --> 08:26.607
* Yeaah, yeaah

08:26.640 --> 08:33.747
* Yeaah, yeaah

08:33.781 --> 08:38.485
* All around the world
People looking for love *

08:38.518 --> 08:41.889
* All around the world, all
around the world *

08:41.922 --> 08:44.491
* All around the world

08:44.524 --> 08:49.296
* Looking for love
Looking for love *

08:49.329 --> 08:51.799
* All around the world

08:52.700 --> 08:53.667
No...

08:53.701 --> 08:56.269
I think Sun Hi would be
sad to be missing this.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.238
I think you're right.

08:58.271 --> 08:59.873
Jodi: Sun Hi?

08:59.907 --> 09:00.540
Corki: Sun Hi?

09:00.574 --> 09:02.242
Don't you have class?

09:02.275 --> 09:03.644
Yes.

09:03.677 --> 09:04.978
But I'm sick.

09:05.012 --> 09:07.881
My eyeballs are
completely dried out.

09:07.915 --> 09:10.283
Are you sure you're not
just forgetting to blink?

09:10.317 --> 09:11.451
I was reading
our review

09:11.484 --> 09:14.521
which led me to an article
about us in the local paper.

09:14.554 --> 09:18.358
That led me to a story
about potbellied pigs.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.894
And that led me to a
site where I watched

09:20.928 --> 09:24.998
two incredible seasons of
"Tracey's Turbo Taxi".

09:25.032 --> 09:27.668
Then I remembered the band
and tracked down a review

09:27.701 --> 09:30.037
in the MacKendrick
Gazette.

09:30.070 --> 09:36.910
Which is where I found this
comment, from Populargirl15.

09:36.944 --> 09:39.046
It says, "Best
new band ever?"

09:39.079 --> 09:43.751
Ummm. Only if this
is Opposite Land!"

09:43.784 --> 09:45.619
Okay, that's pretty harsh.

09:45.653 --> 09:47.688
But it's the only
bad comment on here.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.623
Then it's the only
one that matters.

09:49.657 --> 09:51.024
You never care
what anyone thinks.

09:51.058 --> 09:51.925
I know, right?

09:51.959 --> 09:53.293
I'm not myself!

09:53.326 --> 09:55.495
I'm sorry!

09:57.397 --> 09:59.967
I love Tracey's
Turbo Taxi.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.035
*

10:02.069 --> 10:04.404
(School bell rings)

10:04.437 --> 10:07.941
Jodi, listen to what
Populargirl15 just said.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.010
"Sun Hi thinks her
band's amazing.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.545
But really, it's
just amazingly bad."

10:12.579 --> 10:14.547
So then I wrote, "That's
what you think."

10:14.581 --> 10:15.749
Are you feeling okay?

10:15.783 --> 10:17.851
Super!

10:17.885 --> 10:19.887
So now, what's a
better way to say,

10:19.920 --> 10:20.921
"You stink like cheese,

10:20.954 --> 10:23.857
And not the cheese that's
supposed to stink"?

10:23.891 --> 10:27.427
Look, I know it hurts when
people say bad things about you,

10:27.460 --> 10:28.962
but be the
bigger person.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.363
Focus on other things.

10:30.397 --> 10:31.865
Like what, the play?

10:31.899 --> 10:34.501
Everyone knows I
can't do that!

10:34.534 --> 10:38.571
The band's all I've got and
Populargirl15 is trashing it!

10:38.605 --> 10:40.974
She's just trying to provoke
a reaction out of you.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.075
She's a troll.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.343
That's right.

10:43.376 --> 10:48.115
And I'm gonna smoke that troll
out of that sewer she lives in.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.249
Wow.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.785
I will not be joining you
on that little adventure.

10:51.819 --> 10:55.856
I just had these
clothes dry cleaned.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.693
*

11:06.800 --> 11:07.968
(sigh)

11:11.604 --> 11:12.873
Hey, what's wrong?

11:12.906 --> 11:14.875
I can't believe I
lost my sketch book.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.676
I had the coolest
designs worked out,

11:16.710 --> 11:18.678
and now I have to
start all over.

11:18.712 --> 11:21.014
They'll never be as
good as they were.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.516
When something like that
happens with my music,

11:23.550 --> 11:26.386
I just let my
mind go free.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.388
Sometimes it turns
out even better.

11:28.421 --> 11:32.425
And other times, worse.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.027
So I'm not the
only crazy one.

11:34.061 --> 11:34.962
Nope.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.964
Not to say that you're
crazy or anything.

11:36.997 --> 11:42.469
Just crazy brilliant.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.838
No one's ever
called me that before.

11:44.872 --> 11:47.140
That's because they
don't know you,

11:47.174 --> 11:50.043
Ms. "Crazy
Brilliant Pants".

11:50.077 --> 11:52.813
So how do you let
your mind go free?

11:52.846 --> 11:55.916
Well often times there's not
more than one thing in there.

11:55.949 --> 11:58.919
So it's pretty
easy for me.

11:58.952 --> 12:00.453
C'mon.

12:00.487 --> 12:03.123
Artist to artist.

12:04.457 --> 12:10.163
*

12:10.197 --> 12:15.068
Alright, okay.

12:20.207 --> 12:23.676
(phone beeping)

12:23.710 --> 12:24.711
Oh, no!

12:24.744 --> 12:26.446
The play rehearsal!

12:26.479 --> 12:29.082
We're late, come on!

12:29.716 --> 12:32.552
*

12:32.585 --> 12:33.954
Sun Hi: I'm
gonna get cha!

12:33.987 --> 12:39.459
And I'm gonna
find ya!

12:39.492 --> 12:44.932
Whaa, can't
hide from me!

12:44.965 --> 12:47.667
So... I'm gonna go.

12:47.700 --> 12:50.070
I'll leave you here
to your own devices.

12:50.103 --> 12:50.804
Get it?

12:50.838 --> 12:52.605
Cause you're on
all of your--

12:52.639 --> 12:55.575
Listen the troll goes
to our school, her comment,

12:55.608 --> 12:58.078
"Your band could use a,
little of the Wizard's magic"

12:58.111 --> 13:01.748
points to an intimate
knowledge of the play.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.051
It is a cast or
crew member.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.618
Great work.

13:05.652 --> 13:06.820
Well, see you later--

13:06.854 --> 13:08.521
You haven't heard
my plan yet!

13:08.555 --> 13:10.924
I'm going to bait her into
saying more annoying drivel

13:10.958 --> 13:13.760
during rehearsal and
catch her in the act!

13:13.793 --> 13:14.895
Wow.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.796
I'm shocked at the depth
and deviousness of your plan.

13:16.830 --> 13:17.664
Thank you.

13:17.697 --> 13:18.531
I appreciate it.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.567
It wasn't a compliment.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.769
Although I do admire how
resourceful you can be

13:22.802 --> 13:24.704
when you put
your mind to it.

13:24.737 --> 13:26.073
Is that a compliment?

13:26.106 --> 13:31.678
If it means I can
leave, then yes.

13:35.849 --> 13:39.152
Jared, you're supposed to be
keeping track of everyone.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.787
We're missing
The Scarecrow.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.923
I'm sorry Mr. Stark
it won't happen again.

13:42.956 --> 13:45.525
On a more creative level,
I can't help but wonder

13:45.558 --> 13:48.896
if the Munchkins
should be munchier.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.230
They can't get
any munchier.

13:50.263 --> 13:55.502
This school has rules
about this kind of thing.

13:56.636 --> 13:57.770
Where were you guys?

13:57.804 --> 14:00.307
We were... stuck
in traffic.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.975
You have a car?

14:02.009 --> 14:03.710
Did I just say traffic?

14:03.743 --> 14:04.978
He meant quicksand.

14:05.012 --> 14:08.281
But there's no
quicksand around here.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.183
And that's what
makes it so strange...

14:10.217 --> 14:17.857
and yet... believable.

14:19.226 --> 14:21.661
Mr. Stark: Oh please,
stop talking.

14:21.694 --> 14:22.762
Especially you.

14:22.795 --> 14:24.764
(phone beeping)

14:28.768 --> 14:31.704
Of course it is...

14:31.738 --> 14:32.705
A-ha!!

14:32.739 --> 14:34.074
I knew it!

14:34.107 --> 14:35.575
What's the meaning of this?

14:35.608 --> 14:36.977
The meaning is...

14:37.010 --> 14:39.579
Valerie Graves
is a troll!

14:39.612 --> 14:41.281
Angry and
dismayed selfie!

14:41.314 --> 14:42.249
Grrr.

14:42.282 --> 14:46.186
Whoa, there are
no trolls in Oz.

14:46.219 --> 14:49.022
Interesting idea.

14:49.056 --> 14:53.626
No, really, she's been
trashing me and my band.

14:53.660 --> 14:54.928
Is this true, Valerie?

14:54.962 --> 14:55.929
Yes.

14:55.963 --> 14:56.729
It is.

14:56.763 --> 14:57.931
Don't try and deny it!

14:57.965 --> 14:59.166
Wait, what?

14:59.199 --> 15:01.168
I'm sorry, but the
last time I checked,

15:01.201 --> 15:03.003
I'm allowed to have
my own opinions.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.605
Just like you have opinions
about chasing fame

15:05.638 --> 15:08.275
and who knows what on
your cute little blog...

15:08.308 --> 15:11.711
Those opinions are
totally different!

15:11.744 --> 15:12.612
How so?

15:12.645 --> 15:13.046
Because...

15:13.080 --> 15:14.347
They're mine.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.950
Plus, I'm a better
person than she is!

15:16.984 --> 15:20.620
Okay Sun Hi this is a
closed rehearsal, alright.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.990
Let's go back to the
monkey number people!

15:23.023 --> 15:24.057
This time Caleb,

15:24.091 --> 15:28.261
I wanna hear that primate
chatter in the back row!

15:28.295 --> 15:29.596
Okay people.

15:33.233 --> 15:36.236
It was Valerie.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.205
Why do you care
what Valerie says?

15:38.238 --> 15:39.272
I don't know!

15:39.306 --> 15:42.309
I never question myself.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.044
It's kinda like
with my father,

15:44.077 --> 15:47.214
why do I constantly worry
about his approval?

15:47.247 --> 15:49.682
Maybe because he's
a bazillionaire

15:49.716 --> 15:53.320
who can take away your allowance
whenever he gets "disappointed."

15:53.353 --> 15:55.755
Obvi.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.057
Yeah.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.691
I think we both need to

15:58.725 --> 16:01.161
stop thinking about
external approval.

16:01.194 --> 16:04.064
Okay.

16:04.097 --> 16:07.667
I can tell you how great you are
and you tell me how amazing,

16:07.700 --> 16:11.071
unique and astonishing
I am on a daily basis...

16:11.104 --> 16:13.273
Better make it hourly.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.707
Deal.

16:14.741 --> 16:19.146
As long as you
take care of this.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.783
I still look fabulous!

16:25.218 --> 16:29.856
Sun Hi: Brrraaaaaauuuuu
Eeeeeeeeee, Awwww

16:29.889 --> 16:32.125
I'm not even gonna ask.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.127
Don't question
my methods!

16:34.161 --> 16:36.329
Well wrap it up,
go grab Corki.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.098
The shows about
to start.

16:38.131 --> 16:39.332
I'll go get her.

16:39.366 --> 16:41.268
Brrruuuuuu.

16:41.301 --> 16:42.302
People in the house...

16:42.335 --> 16:45.372
It's XO-IQ!

16:57.517 --> 17:01.254
* Why d'ya think you
got to be better *

17:01.288 --> 17:02.722
* Who said

17:02.755 --> 17:07.427
* Who said that you need
to go and change *

17:07.460 --> 17:11.331
* Can't you find a
tighter sweater *

17:11.364 --> 17:12.732
* Well we say

17:12.765 --> 17:17.470

17:30.150 --> 17:32.485
* Follow us the way
we're walking *

17:32.519 --> 17:37.490
* If you want that cute boy
callin' you ooo oo *

17:37.524 --> 17:40.093
* Don't listen to a
word they're saying *

17:40.127 --> 17:42.495
* We'll be 5-star
hotel staying *

17:42.529 --> 17:46.866

17:47.900 --> 17:52.472

17:52.505 --> 17:57.477
* Ow ow, ow ow,

17:57.510 --> 18:01.414
* Now they want your
lips to be redder *

18:01.448 --> 18:07.454
* And they say they say
OMG your skirt's too long *

18:07.487 --> 18:11.258
* Come with us and the
boys will be better *

18:11.291 --> 18:12.459
* Yeah we say

(cheering)

19:14.454 --> 19:15.888
*

19:15.922 --> 19:18.090
Jodi: That was one of
your best songs yet

19:18.124 --> 19:18.958
Thanks, you like?

19:18.991 --> 19:21.561
I mean, yeah you liked it?

19:21.594 --> 19:22.595
Totally.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.264
Can I hear more?

19:24.297 --> 19:26.933
Yeah, I mean I got a
couple more songs...

19:26.966 --> 19:29.236
Wow.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.338
I'll be busy into next year.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.458
*

19:53.092 --> 19:56.028
Sun Hi: Du, da, du,
da, da, du, du.

19:56.062 --> 19:56.629
Hey guys.

19:56.663 --> 19:57.897
What's up?

19:57.930 --> 20:00.300
Why does something always have
to be up with this generation?

20:00.333 --> 20:02.168
Can't anything ever
just be normal?

20:02.201 --> 20:04.571
I mean I blame
social media!

20:04.604 --> 20:07.240
Owe.

20:07.274 --> 20:08.074
What's with him?

20:08.107 --> 20:08.975
I didn't notice him.

20:09.008 --> 20:10.677
Because I pay no
attention to him.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.145
No reason to, you know?

20:13.179 --> 20:14.180
(phone beeping)

20:14.213 --> 20:14.614
Oh!

20:14.647 --> 20:15.882
Look at that.

20:15.915 --> 20:19.486
It's already time for Corki to
tell me how great I am again.

20:19.519 --> 20:22.355
These things just
make the day fly by!

20:22.955 --> 20:30.630
*

20:30.663 --> 20:33.032
All right Sun Hi
Nation, listen up!

20:33.065 --> 20:36.303
I feel closer to a
more perfect me.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.537
Wait!

20:37.570 --> 20:40.440
How many people saw me look
like a crazed maniac yesterday?

20:40.473 --> 20:43.142
It was definitely ninety five
percent of the student body--

20:43.175 --> 20:44.143
Stop!

20:44.176 --> 20:48.114
Corki, I said I'm close
to a more perfect me,

20:48.147 --> 20:50.717
but there are still times
when you must lie to me

20:50.750 --> 20:54.020
as much as humanly
possible, okay?

20:54.053 --> 20:54.821
(phone beeping)

20:54.854 --> 20:56.523
I'm not ever going
to lie to you.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.124
I'm just going
to let you

20:58.157 --> 21:01.160
continue to discover
your better self.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.331
It's Jared.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.332
What does he want?

21:05.365 --> 21:07.567
He said "I need to see you".

21:07.600 --> 21:10.670
What do you think this
means, "I need to see you?"

21:10.703 --> 21:12.705
Probably nothing, right?

21:12.739 --> 21:14.441
But it could be anything.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.543
It could be everything.

21:16.576 --> 21:20.680
It could be the most
pivotal moment of my life...

21:20.713 --> 21:24.651
It's good she's keeping
her expectations low.

21:24.684 --> 21:25.652
Yeah.

21:25.685 --> 21:28.988
I'm sure this is going
to work out just fine...

21:29.021 --> 21:33.025
*
