He had to watch
her swallow his last eyeball.

08:42.792 --> 08:44.726
She kept it attached
to the optic nerve,

08:44.760 --> 08:46.695
so he could see
down her throat,

08:46.729 --> 08:49.731
to his own
partially digested flesh

08:49.765 --> 08:51.733

such a fan of... Gore.

09:12.940 --> 09:13.682
It's Halloween.

09:13.717 --> 09:15.351
If you're gonna
tell a scary story,

09:15.385 --> 09:17.820
- give it some texture.
- Wasn't that great.

09:17.854 --> 09:19.505
Well, your texture was so

09:19.539 --> 09:22.124
discompassionately macabre,

09:22.159 --> 09:24.860
as if without the slightest
regard for human life.

09:24.895 --> 09:27.062
That's enough.
Stop pinning ribbons to her.

09:27.097 --> 09:28.364
Why does Annie get
to be good at everything?

09:28.398 --> 09:32.568

your stupid stories.

11:44.901 --> 11:45.834
I didn't say it was you.

crazy, old, racist friend.

11:51.708 --> 11:53.509
I was, anyway.
Now I'm not so sure.

That wasn't even a ghost story.

12:55.505 --> 12:57.206
It was like
an episode of some show

What happened to the days
when ghost stories

18:31.641 --> 18:33.142
It doesn't matter.
I filled mine out randomly.

18:33.176 --> 18:35.744
- Oh, come on.
- What?

18:35.779 --> 18:37.446
You idiot!

18:37.481 --> 18:40.866
That was probably the test that
returned the psychotic result!

18:40.917 --> 18:42.535
Hmm. Maybe.

18:42.586 --> 18:44.520
Well, what kind of sociopath
doesn't offer that information,

18:44.554 --> 18:45.621
like, an hour ago?

18:45.655 --> 18:47.423
No, no.
I'm no sociopath.

18:47.457 --> 18:50.125
I always know
what I'm doing is wrong.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.194
I'm just a guy that doesn't
like taking tests, doing work,

18:52.229 --> 18:53.546
or getting yelled at.

18:53.597 --> 18:54.797
So if you think about it,

18:54.831 --> 18:56.265
that makes me
the sanest person here.

18:56.299 --> 18:57.533
Boo!

18:57.567 --> 18:59.301
[All booing]

18:59.335 --> 19:00.719
Is this your test or what?

19:00.770 --> 19:02.071
How should I know?
It's just a bunch of bubbles.

19:02.105 --> 19:03.689
Wait!

19:03.723 --> 19:05.374
Give me those.

19:05.408 --> 19:07.393
Why are the scores
on the bottoms of the sheets?

19:07.444 --> 19:09.645
They should--

19:09.679 --> 19:12.531
Britta, look at the arrow.

19:12.566 --> 19:13.949
You ran these through
the machine upside-down.

19:13.984 --> 19:15.751
She Britta'd it.

19:15.785 --> 19:19.321
Whatever.
I'll run them through again.

19:19.355 --> 19:21.657
And you guys
are gonna stop using my name

19:21.691 --> 19:25.928
to mean "making a tiny
and understandable mistake."

19:25.962 --> 19:29.532
[Thunder]

19:32.168 --> 19:34.003
So we're all insane.

19:34.037 --> 19:37.239
Well, except for this person.

19:37.274 --> 19:38.607
Is that one mine?

19:38.642 --> 19:40.576
We should probably
figure it out, right?

19:40.610 --> 19:42.011
If one of us
isn't crazy, it's only fair

19:42.045 --> 19:43.479
that the rest of us
know who they are.

19:43.513 --> 19:45.281
Or we could hold on
to the comforting notion

19:45.315 --> 19:47.983
t-that any one of us
m-might be sane.

19:48.018 --> 19:49.919
Yeah. Okay.

19:49.953 --> 19:52.421
We learned
an important lesson tonight.

19:52.455 --> 19:54.356
We should never make the Britta

19:54.391 --> 19:57.593
of Britta-ing
each other's feelings.

19:57.627 --> 19:58.661
You're using it wrong.

19:58.695 --> 20:00.663
Wow.
You Britta'd "Britta'd."

20:00.697 --> 20:02.281
- Yeah, way to pull an Abed.
- I don't get it.

20:02.332 --> 20:03.299
Shirley, don't Pierce.

20:03.333 --> 20:05.334
I don't get it.

20:07.571 --> 20:09.572
Do not get it.

20:21.872 --> 20:24.459
Guys, it's been three days!

20:24.579 --> 20:26.666
When are you gonna let me go?

20:27.208 --> 20:28.959
At least say something!

20:28.993 --> 20:29.960
Guys?

20:29.994 --> 20:31.695
Guys!

20:31.730 --> 20:32.829
Should we let him go?

20:32.847 --> 20:35.199
Hmm...Let me think.

20:35.233 --> 20:37.268
Nah.
More Brandy?

20:37.302 --> 20:40.054
Don't mind if I do.

20:40.105 --> 20:42.373
Mmm...That's terrible.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.008
Should we get back
in our F-15 that we repaired

20:44.042 --> 20:45.008
with our mind power?

20:45.026 --> 20:46.510
I was thinking the same thing!

20:46.544 --> 20:47.645
Both: I know!

20:47.679 --> 20:48.779
Jinx!
Double jinx!

20:48.813 --> 20:49.780
Triple jinx!
