00:05.428 --> 00:06.929
Previously on Billions...

00:06.929 --> 00:08.637
Tomorrow is
Rebecca Cantu's first day

00:08.637 --> 00:09.929
as CEO of Saler's.

00:09.929 --> 00:12.053
I want it to be
a bad one for her.

00:12.053 --> 00:13.553
With Taylor effectively

00:13.553 --> 00:15.261
in control of Kling,
they also control the supply

00:15.261 --> 00:17.303
of household appliances
that Saler's sells.

00:17.303 --> 00:19.679
And if Taylor decides to cut
the flow of those appliances?

00:19.679 --> 00:20.970
It'll gut you.

00:20.970 --> 00:22.512
The deal requires you walk away

00:22.512 --> 00:23.804
from the voting nonsense.

00:23.804 --> 00:25.595
Blockchain.
Your pilot program.

00:25.595 --> 00:27.220
So that's what Jock needs.

00:27.220 --> 00:29.637
Dr. Rhoades, your medical
license is under review.

00:29.637 --> 00:31.679
There is still,
somewhere inside of you,

00:31.679 --> 00:33.220
someone who knows
right from wrong.

00:33.220 --> 00:35.720
This hearing is your chance
to reclaim that person.

00:35.720 --> 00:38.387
Just share what you need
to get you out of this.

00:38.387 --> 00:41.512
Whatever our understanding,
it can't just be verbal...

00:41.512 --> 00:44.595
I've taken the liberty.

00:44.595 --> 00:46.178
Did they paper
this fucking deal?

00:46.178 --> 00:48.011
Now that it's just
the three of us, I have to say,

00:48.011 --> 00:50.053
I did not know the nature
of that conversation.

00:50.053 --> 00:51.470
You have to tell him everything.

00:51.470 --> 00:54.261
So he can defend us,
whatever may come.

00:54.261 --> 00:56.929
You mean about the idiot
who stands to lose the most?

00:56.929 --> 00:58.637
Baby brother.

00:58.637 --> 00:59.887
You suddenly showing up here...

00:59.887 --> 01:01.470
Must mean you want something.

01:01.470 --> 01:03.553
The one thing you do with those
hands better than fight.

01:03.553 --> 01:05.387
There's a safe?

01:05.387 --> 01:08.345
You bet your ass there is.

01:34.428 --> 01:35.637
Dad...

01:36.804 --> 01:38.136
...it's the crack
of dawn.

01:38.136 --> 01:40.136
Holy shit, Sonny.
I'm being bugged.

01:40.136 --> 01:42.804
Okay. Slow it down.
Spell it out. Breathe.

01:42.804 --> 01:45.136
I'll breathe later.
But for now, fucking listen.

01:45.136 --> 01:47.387
I was at home, alone...

02:02.470 --> 02:03.553
Ha!
Ohh.

02:04.679 --> 02:06.970
You are not fast enough

02:06.970 --> 02:10.345
or strong enough to outrun me.

02:10.345 --> 02:13.178
Well, then, you better come
and mount your quarry.

02:13.178 --> 02:15.970
But first, prime me, baby.

02:20.845 --> 02:22.887
Ohh! Whoo!

02:22.887 --> 02:24.553
Somehow I found myself
on the floor.

02:24.553 --> 02:27.011
Making a home repair
as I am wont to do, when...

02:27.011 --> 02:29.136
Mom is out of town.
If you were on the floor...

02:29.136 --> 02:31.345
Oh, fuck, I don't even
want to say it.

02:31.345 --> 02:33.178
Cuz then I'll have
the goddamned image in my head.

02:56.303 --> 02:58.762
They didn't fix the wood stain
perfectly.

02:58.762 --> 03:00.553
That's how I knew.

03:00.553 --> 03:01.970
I left it in the wall.

03:01.970 --> 03:03.220
So they wouldn't know
what I know.

03:03.220 --> 03:05.011
But what I know, Sonny Boy,

03:05.011 --> 03:06.845
is the government is on to me.

03:06.845 --> 03:09.220
Well, us.
Oh. Shit.

03:09.220 --> 03:11.095
They might've heard me
talk about Jock.

03:11.095 --> 03:14.178
What I've been planning. Okay.

03:14.178 --> 03:16.845
You need to go on the lam,
Whitey Bulger style.

03:16.845 --> 03:18.637
Or better, DB Cooper.

03:18.637 --> 03:20.095
Never caught.

03:20.095 --> 03:21.553
The document.
I need to go back.

03:21.553 --> 03:23.679
Get it out of the safe...
Your apartment isn't secure.

03:23.679 --> 03:25.970
They could be ready to pick you
up. I'll send someone.

03:25.970 --> 03:27.387
Can't.
It's a biometric lock.

03:27.387 --> 03:29.553
Oh. Terrific...

03:29.553 --> 03:31.887
Well, I'll have to speed up
everything on the Jock front...

03:31.887 --> 03:33.887
Ah, fuck!

03:33.887 --> 03:35.887
If they got a warrant
for your place,

03:35.887 --> 03:37.220
I could also be...

04:12.595 --> 04:16.595
Tell whomever you
send I'm sorry for the mess,

04:16.595 --> 04:20.053
but me and Roxanne,
when we get down,

04:20.053 --> 04:23.804
well, we don't fuck around.

04:52.387 --> 04:53.470
Brogan.

04:53.470 --> 04:56.929
I need you to
do a service for me.

04:56.929 --> 04:58.595
Recognize the voice?

04:58.595 --> 05:00.637
I do.
And my debt to you.

05:00.637 --> 05:04.637
You will be part of a detachment
formed for specific purpose...

05:04.637 --> 05:07.637
To deliver the final,
fatal blow to Jock Jeffcoat.

05:07.637 --> 05:10.053
Now, find a spot where
5 men can meet, and...

05:11.345 --> 05:14.053
I'm sorry, can you hold please?

05:14.053 --> 05:16.470
Are you fucking kidding?

05:16.470 --> 05:19.762
One of the very men I need
is on the other line.

05:19.762 --> 05:23.553
Ira, old pal, you're next
on my phone sheet...

05:23.553 --> 05:27.095
Jesus, that's like
three weeks early.

05:27.095 --> 05:30.178
Can I...

05:30.178 --> 05:33.303
Okay, I'll see you later then.

05:35.178 --> 05:36.512
Forget arranging a location.

05:36.512 --> 05:38.095
I know where we're meeting...

05:38.095 --> 05:40.553
Can't.
It's a biometric lock.

05:40.553 --> 05:42.428
Terrific...

05:42.428 --> 05:44.053
Uh...

05:44.053 --> 05:46.220
I'll have to speed everything
up on the Jock front...

05:46.220 --> 05:48.345
Oh, fuck!

05:48.345 --> 05:51.220
If they got a warrant for
your place, I could also be...

05:53.887 --> 05:56.387
So the shit train
was just the beginning.

05:56.387 --> 05:57.970
Yeah. Seems to be.

05:57.970 --> 06:00.053
What exactly is Rhoades
coming after me for?

06:00.053 --> 06:01.345
That I don't know.

06:01.345 --> 06:03.178
But I upped the physical
surveillance on him.

06:03.178 --> 06:05.011
Well, that's a start.
Here's an improvement:

06:05.011 --> 06:06.428
You scoop up that old man

06:06.428 --> 06:08.095
and you sweat him
'til the truth pours out.

06:08.095 --> 06:10.178
Would love to. But haven't been
able to locate him.

06:10.178 --> 06:11.929
He took Chuck's advice.
He's gone to ground.

06:11.929 --> 06:14.053
You are
a United States Attorney.

06:14.053 --> 06:16.387
You find his
wrinkly fucking ass.

06:16.387 --> 06:19.053
Uh, I saw it once. And actually,
the old guy keeps it together.

06:20.553 --> 06:23.428
Still... I take your point.

06:26.512 --> 06:28.220
Pearlsang Appliances
is still your business.

06:28.220 --> 06:30.553
You'll still run it.
Except now you'll own it.

06:30.553 --> 06:32.762
And you want us upping
production by twenty percent.

06:32.762 --> 06:35.261
We can't sell more
if we don't have more.

06:35.261 --> 06:37.178
You get it done
so we won't have to

06:37.178 --> 06:38.804
get in there and do it for you.

06:38.804 --> 06:40.470
Because believe you me,
you do not want

06:40.470 --> 06:42.970
Rebecca Cantu stalking
your assembly lines.

06:42.970 --> 06:46.679
When you put it that way,
let me get with my people

06:46.679 --> 06:49.595
and figure out how we can run
the factories around the clock.

06:49.595 --> 06:52.428
Saler's looks forward to
selling the fuck out of your...

06:52.428 --> 06:54.762
And soon to be our... appliances.

06:57.470 --> 06:59.095
The meeting is happening.

06:59.095 --> 07:00.887
Then drop what you got
on Pearlsang.

07:00.887 --> 07:03.178
Sometimes I really
love this job.

07:21.553 --> 07:23.637
It is the time of year
that you've all had circled

07:23.637 --> 07:25.804
on your calendars since
the moment you hopped aboard.

07:25.804 --> 07:27.470
But Royal Rumble
was two months ago!

07:27.470 --> 07:29.470
Thirty enter.
One remains.

07:29.470 --> 07:32.095
Similar, actually,
because it's comp time.

07:32.095 --> 07:34.804
I'm not doing meetings.

07:34.804 --> 07:37.053
I'm not going to force you
to justify your existence.

07:37.053 --> 07:38.553
The numbers already do that.

07:38.553 --> 07:41.762
Still, I know some of you
have been... anxious.

07:41.762 --> 07:44.387
Both about your performance
and mine this past year.

07:44.387 --> 07:47.970
So know this: I can afford
to pay you all full freight,

07:47.970 --> 07:49.470
which you'll find
is more than you made

07:49.470 --> 07:50.970
at any of your old shops...

07:52.720 --> 07:54.637
If you leave your money
in the fund

07:54.637 --> 07:56.804
for at least the next
twelve months.

07:56.804 --> 07:59.095
If you insist on
drawing your pay immediately,

07:59.095 --> 08:00.845
and at your discretion...

08:00.845 --> 08:03.345
the payout will be 60 cents
on the theoretical dollar.

08:03.345 --> 08:04.804
I'll await your
individual decisions

08:04.804 --> 08:06.845
by end of day tomorrow.

08:11.845 --> 08:13.011
Fuck!

08:13.011 --> 08:15.261
Motherfuck.

08:15.261 --> 08:16.512
I don't know where it leaves me.

08:16.512 --> 08:18.095
But that's a smart
approach for Taylor

08:18.095 --> 08:19.845
in a year they're trying
to conserve resources.

08:19.845 --> 08:23.261
So's asphyxiating every third
person, but frowned upon.

08:23.261 --> 08:26.345
Especially by the guy who'd be
the first one smothered.

08:30.679 --> 08:31.845
Thanks.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.178
Thank you.

08:35.220 --> 08:38.135
She got a premium for
a mediocre fucking company.

08:38.135 --> 08:41.636
Yeah, well, that is what makes
Taylor Mason so good.

08:41.636 --> 08:44.762
Makes you do things...
Compromise your approach...

08:44.762 --> 08:46.261
In ways you never usually would.

08:46.261 --> 08:47.720
You admire it.

08:47.720 --> 08:50.178
I like to celebrate
a really good kill.

08:50.178 --> 08:51.970
Connects me to
my spiritual side.

08:51.970 --> 08:54.637
You're a sick twist.
I like to celebrate that.

08:56.345 --> 08:58.303
Axe.
Yeah?

08:58.303 --> 08:59.970
Kitchen's all ready for you.

09:15.637 --> 09:18.095
Thought you'd be with your wife
today. The hearing.

09:18.095 --> 09:20.595
Instead of skull-dugging around
here like Philip Marlowe.

09:20.595 --> 09:22.720
You just compare me to Bogie?

09:22.720 --> 09:25.970
That's the nicest thing
anyone's said to me all week.

09:25.970 --> 09:28.136
Wendy didn't think
it was a good idea

09:28.136 --> 09:30.261
for the State AG
to be sitting behind her

09:30.261 --> 09:33.428
creating the impression he was
trying to influence things.

09:33.428 --> 09:34.428
And you?

09:34.428 --> 09:35.595
Yeah. Same.

09:35.595 --> 09:37.011
Didn't want me there
seeming like

09:37.011 --> 09:38.929
I'd asked her to do
what she was accused of.

09:38.929 --> 09:42.720
So she's better off without us.

09:42.720 --> 09:45.595
Yeah. For today.
For a few hours anyway.

09:45.595 --> 09:48.762
And maybe still not.
But get on with it.

09:48.762 --> 09:52.553
I need a man... with
a certain set of skills.

09:52.553 --> 09:54.387
Your man.
To get into a safe.

09:54.387 --> 09:57.136
And the room that safe is in.
A tough safe.

09:57.136 --> 10:00.178
Ah. A safe that lies outside
the bounds of your authority.

10:00.178 --> 10:02.470
Yeah, I got the guy.
You know I do.

10:02.470 --> 10:05.470
But, Chuck,
I'm not some USO girl

10:05.470 --> 10:07.553
dispensing donuts
and dances here.

10:07.553 --> 10:09.553
Taylor Mason should be in
a numbered fucking jumpsuit.

10:09.553 --> 10:11.512
If my dad and I get
fitted for them first,

10:11.512 --> 10:13.136
that's never gonna happen.

10:13.136 --> 10:14.887
You keep telling me why
you can't get it done

10:14.887 --> 10:17.011
and what you need to do first.

10:17.011 --> 10:18.637
Your days were never so full

10:18.637 --> 10:21.470
or disorganized when you were
gunning for me.

10:21.470 --> 10:23.804
Maybe this isn't
personal enough for you.

10:25.553 --> 10:27.804
You need me to make it
fucking personal?

10:27.804 --> 10:31.428
Taylor Mason
didn't just betray you.

10:31.428 --> 10:34.011
They fucked with Wendy
a dozen different ways.

10:34.011 --> 10:36.970
So, yeah, I can get that
happy hate going if I need to.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.845
But I've also given my word.
More than once.

10:39.845 --> 10:42.053
And that should
fucking count, too.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.887
You can use my man.

10:47.887 --> 10:50.011
Give me what he needs to know
about this safe

10:50.011 --> 10:52.720
and he'll know it.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.261
Confirm nothing.
Admit nothing.

10:55.261 --> 10:57.720
If Taylor doesn't show,
they have nothing.

10:57.720 --> 10:59.679
Unless you give them something.

10:59.679 --> 11:01.845
So, don't.

11:01.845 --> 11:05.011
I can't tell you to lie.

11:05.011 --> 11:07.929
I can only tell you that they'll
never be able to prove it,

11:07.929 --> 11:10.720
and it's the perfect solution
to all your problems.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.470
I hope so.

11:12.470 --> 11:15.220
Is that what your clients say?

11:15.220 --> 11:18.303
Do they always feel good
when they avoid punishment?

11:18.303 --> 11:19.804
Just move on with their lives?

11:19.804 --> 11:22.470
Real criminals are different
than you and me.

11:22.470 --> 11:26.387
Something about the mind-set of
someone who does those things.

11:26.387 --> 11:27.720
By the time I get 'em,

11:27.720 --> 11:29.512
they are long past
wondering who they are.

11:29.512 --> 11:30.887
They already know.

11:30.887 --> 11:33.470
They just want to
get away with it.

11:33.470 --> 11:35.053
Maybe I'm not so different.

11:35.053 --> 11:36.679
You are.

11:36.679 --> 11:39.470
And later, you may
feel some remorse.

11:39.470 --> 11:41.387
Which you will deal with,
Doctor Rhoades.

11:41.387 --> 11:42.553
But for now...

11:42.553 --> 11:44.220
For now, I do what you said.

11:53.387 --> 11:54.887
Thank you.

11:54.887 --> 11:56.887
We are here today to explore
serious charges

11:56.887 --> 11:59.053
against Doctor Wendy Rhoades.

11:59.053 --> 12:03.303
First, if she acted in
a medical capacity and, if so...

12:03.303 --> 12:05.136
I did.

12:06.679 --> 12:09.053
Give me a minute with my client...

12:12.220 --> 12:15.053
I am a doctor.

12:17.303 --> 12:19.762
Taylor Mason was my patient.

12:19.762 --> 12:24.261
I failed to respect
patient confidentiality

12:24.261 --> 12:27.011
and used information
revealed in session

12:27.011 --> 12:28.553
for my own personal gain...

12:28.553 --> 12:31.804
Or if I didn't technically gain,

12:31.804 --> 12:34.720
at least my own ends.

12:37.136 --> 12:38.428
Can you repeat that?

12:38.428 --> 12:40.845
Yes.

12:40.845 --> 12:42.220
Because it's the truth.

12:47.637 --> 12:49.387
I got us a table at...

12:51.637 --> 12:53.470
Oh.

12:53.470 --> 12:55.470
I see.

13:08.136 --> 13:09.970
This changes nothing.

13:09.970 --> 13:12.762
Everybody at Axe Cap
is and will remain

13:12.762 --> 13:15.470
deeply fucked in the head.

13:15.470 --> 13:19.804
We will all need your help
as a coach and a human.

13:19.804 --> 13:22.178
Thank you.

13:22.178 --> 13:26.470
But I, uh
finally feel myself again.

13:26.470 --> 13:28.887
You don't look it.

13:28.887 --> 13:30.178
Hmm.

13:30.178 --> 13:31.845
My face will catch up.

13:31.845 --> 13:36.095
It just needs to relax
into itself first.

13:39.845 --> 13:42.011
Wendy confessed
to the Medical Board.

13:42.011 --> 13:44.011
Ding dong, the witch is...

13:44.011 --> 13:46.178
We don't celebrate. Wendy merely
did the right thing.

13:46.178 --> 13:49.095
That's all.
We move forward.

13:53.845 --> 13:56.261
This is some detailed fucking
intel you brought here.

13:56.261 --> 13:58.178
I know the agent
who bugged the place.

13:58.178 --> 14:00.053
And he just gave you
the roadmap?

14:00.053 --> 14:01.970
In a manner of speaking.

14:01.970 --> 14:04.720
Nice.

14:04.720 --> 14:07.595
Well, I cased the place
myself anyway.

14:07.595 --> 14:09.345
Great.
So you know how to do it?

14:09.345 --> 14:10.637
I do.

14:10.637 --> 14:13.261
But it's a pass, bro.

14:13.261 --> 14:16.553
What the fuck, man?

14:16.553 --> 14:18.053
You're Bill Belichick,

14:18.053 --> 14:21.011
I just brought you video
of the Jets' signals and...

14:21.011 --> 14:22.887
Compare me to that fat fucking

14:22.887 --> 14:24.303
sweatshirt sausage
one more time...

14:24.303 --> 14:26.720
Oh. Nah, it's...
It's a positive comparison.

14:26.720 --> 14:28.387
You're smart like him.

14:28.387 --> 14:30.887
Yeah, well, I'm smart enough
that I only got caught

14:30.887 --> 14:35.095
once in my career... because
I knew which jobs not to take.

14:35.095 --> 14:36.887
This is one of 'em.

14:36.887 --> 14:39.345
You only got caught once because
I made the other ones go away.

14:41.804 --> 14:44.220
I literally got one thing in
my life that I'm proud of...

14:44.220 --> 14:48.095
The time you cropdusted
that pedo Father Collins.

14:48.095 --> 14:50.011
Okay. Two things.

14:51.762 --> 14:55.345
But you're the other one.

14:55.345 --> 14:57.512
And this ain't you, bro.

15:01.053 --> 15:04.929
Catching the bad guy is
as me as it fucking gets.

15:04.929 --> 15:06.845
So, yeah, I'm asking you,
guilting you...

15:06.845 --> 15:08.845
Whatever it takes
to get you to pull this.

15:08.845 --> 15:12.762
Do I have to remind you
which one of us stayed home

15:12.762 --> 15:14.428
to look after
our blessed mother...

15:14.428 --> 15:17.887
Is blessed some kind of
synonym for drunk bitch now...

15:17.887 --> 15:21.428
Easy there.
And in this case, yeah.

15:21.428 --> 15:24.261
Yet I stayed.

15:26.553 --> 15:28.387
Okay, little bro.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.637
I'll do this thing...

15:31.637 --> 15:34.970
We will.

15:34.970 --> 15:36.720
Whoa, whoa. Wh...
You want to come with?

15:36.720 --> 15:38.136
You're fucking killing me.

15:38.136 --> 15:39.804
I know the document
we're looking for.

15:39.804 --> 15:41.595
That's what we're taking?
A piece of paper?

15:41.595 --> 15:42.970
Not taking it.

15:42.970 --> 15:44.845
Hold on.

15:44.845 --> 15:48.261
Y-You know how it is once
a Scotsman's drawn his dirk...

15:48.261 --> 15:50.929
He can't return that blade
to the sheath

15:50.929 --> 15:52.929
until it's tasted
an Englishman's blood?

15:54.428 --> 15:56.929
Well, I can't open a safe
without taking something.

15:56.929 --> 15:58.679
No. You can and will.
Because otherwise,

15:58.679 --> 16:00.345
I can't use it legally.

16:00.345 --> 16:02.136
I need to read the thing,
photograph it,

16:02.136 --> 16:05.553
and use the info to get
a warrant to come back for it.

16:05.553 --> 16:07.887
You don't actually wonder
why people hate lawyers...

16:07.887 --> 16:10.136
Oh. No, I get it.

16:10.136 --> 16:13.136
A safe cracker is far more
interesting at parties.

16:14.762 --> 16:16.679
The time table's been
turbo charged.

16:16.679 --> 16:18.512
We gotta do this today.

16:18.512 --> 16:20.970
Tonight.

16:20.970 --> 16:23.762
As we used to say before
a schoolyard scrap:

16:23.762 --> 16:26.053
Tonight, long stick goes boom.

16:29.970 --> 16:31.345
I bear bad news from Hall.

16:31.345 --> 16:34.220
You need to back out of
the deal with Pearlsang.

16:34.220 --> 16:36.845
They're about to go radioactive.
What the fuck?

16:36.845 --> 16:40.178
They're gonna be publicly outed
as practitioners of slave labor.

16:40.178 --> 16:42.387
Well. Maybe we can...
Child slave labor.

16:42.387 --> 16:45.011
Temple of Doom shit.
How the fuck...

16:45.011 --> 16:46.804
Hall said it was well-buried,
but Taylor's man

16:46.804 --> 16:49.679
broke someone and leaked it.
Sorry, guys.

16:50.845 --> 16:52.845
Well, that deal is dead.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.762
I mean, he said Temple Of Doom.

16:55.762 --> 16:58.720
Okay, shit.

16:58.720 --> 17:00.762
We can still buy that
other appliance company

17:00.762 --> 17:03.053
I had my guys
look into... Cardinale.

17:03.053 --> 17:04.887
Won't work.
Saler's doesn't have the cash.

17:04.887 --> 17:06.387
Last week's price
was five billion.

17:06.387 --> 17:08.011
This week's...
With one fewer rival

17:08.011 --> 17:09.887
for us to leverage...
It's gonna be even more.

17:14.512 --> 17:16.011
What if you bought it?

17:16.011 --> 17:17.595
I thought about suggesting that

17:17.595 --> 17:20.220
but figured you wouldn't wanna
be the damsel in distress.

17:20.220 --> 17:23.011
Oh. I'm the dame
safeguarding my company.

17:23.011 --> 17:24.637
And while Taylor
may be the locomotive,

17:24.637 --> 17:25.929
you are kinda the one who

17:25.929 --> 17:28.053
tied me to the tracks
in the first place.

17:28.053 --> 17:30.470
So you might as well
rescue me, too.

17:30.470 --> 17:32.470
Revisionist fucking history.

17:32.470 --> 17:35.595
I told you all about
the baggage.

17:35.595 --> 17:37.595
You asked me to come in.
You asked me to stay in.

17:37.595 --> 17:39.887
Because I knew you'd always
find a way to make good.

17:39.887 --> 17:42.095
Like you said you would.
And sometimes that's

17:42.095 --> 17:44.178
strong-arming, sometimes
it's sweet-talking...

17:44.178 --> 17:46.595
Sometimes that's spending five
billion dollars to help you

17:46.595 --> 17:48.428
keep your Barbie
fucking Dreamhouse alive?

17:48.428 --> 17:50.845
With leverage, you'd only
have to put up half, Ken.

17:50.845 --> 17:52.387
Oh.
It's always easier

17:52.387 --> 17:54.095
to open up someone else's
wallet, isn't it?

17:54.095 --> 17:57.053
Before I met you
I went deal to deal,

17:57.053 --> 17:59.303
scooping up businesses
and profits.

17:59.303 --> 18:01.762
And then you wanted to be
my partner on a deal or two,

18:01.762 --> 18:04.637
and now I can't make a move
without a booby trap

18:04.637 --> 18:06.095
going off in my face.

18:09.637 --> 18:11.512
Fine.

18:11.512 --> 18:13.929
This is brutal to the bank account.

18:13.929 --> 18:14.929
Even for me.

18:14.929 --> 18:17.970
But, eh, I'll take it on.

18:17.970 --> 18:19.804
Really?

18:19.804 --> 18:21.512
For you.

18:21.512 --> 18:24.595
Thank you.

18:24.595 --> 18:27.345
But dinner's on you
for... a while.

18:43.136 --> 18:44.720
Why are we here?

18:44.720 --> 18:47.720
To end the Attorney General
of the Unites States.

18:47.720 --> 18:49.470
How the fuck are we
going to do that?

18:49.470 --> 18:51.345
By proving his hatred
of blockchain voting

18:51.345 --> 18:54.136
is motivated by corruption.
Which it is.

18:54.136 --> 18:55.970
Or why else would he
let a caboose of crap

18:55.970 --> 18:57.720
sit in his front yard
to pay for it.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.845
Oy. I need Jock's wrath
like I need a loch in kop.

18:59.845 --> 19:01.095
Shein.

19:01.095 --> 19:02.762
I will try to
shield you from it.

19:02.762 --> 19:04.804
And yet I have the right
to call on you gentlemen...

19:04.804 --> 19:06.261
And now I have.

19:06.261 --> 19:08.178
For I have done a service
for each of you.

19:08.178 --> 19:10.345
For your bankroll,
your security, your family.

19:10.345 --> 19:12.303
None of this explains
though why we're here.

19:12.303 --> 19:14.136
Naturally because
my most trusted counselor

19:14.136 --> 19:16.178
is tethered to this locale
for the foreseeable.

19:16.178 --> 19:17.679
Ira, are you a father again?

19:17.679 --> 19:19.178
Not yet.

19:19.178 --> 19:20.845
The contractions are
15 minutes apart.

19:20.845 --> 19:22.762
So we could have done this
at the fucking track.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.845
I have been banished
from the birthing suite

19:24.845 --> 19:26.011
until right before
the baby comes.

19:26.011 --> 19:27.428
She says I make her nervous.

19:27.428 --> 19:29.428
Taiga?
No. The doctor.

19:29.428 --> 19:31.053
She says my anxiety is catching.

19:31.053 --> 19:34.011
The doctor is a woman.
You trust that?

19:34.011 --> 19:35.261
We all have to pretend we do.

19:35.261 --> 19:36.970
Mm.

19:36.970 --> 19:38.970
Well, back to
the present century,

19:38.970 --> 19:40.970
and the magic of
childbirth aside,

19:40.970 --> 19:42.595
here is what I need
from each of you:

19:42.595 --> 19:44.220
Halloran, you know who
the biggest supplier

19:44.220 --> 19:46.220
of voting equipment is.
Bougle-Tek.

19:46.220 --> 19:48.345
Right you are.
Now, they most benefit

19:48.345 --> 19:50.428
financially from Jock keeping
things the way they are.

19:50.428 --> 19:53.053
So we hit them every which way.

19:53.053 --> 19:55.178
Ira, you're gonna sue 'em.
For what?

19:55.178 --> 19:57.929
Oh. Something public
and scary.

19:57.929 --> 20:00.220
Eisen, you will use
your scummiest PI

20:00.220 --> 20:02.178
with no respect for
data security laws

20:02.178 --> 20:04.512
to work the ex-wife
of Trent Fiske,

20:04.512 --> 20:07.220
Bougle-Tek's CEO, and worm
your way into his finances...

20:07.220 --> 20:08.929
And locate any payments
that might have

20:08.929 --> 20:10.679
gone from him to Jock.
Indeed.

20:10.679 --> 20:13.387
Halloran, you will solicit
a bribe from the company.

20:13.387 --> 20:15.220
How would I go about... Mm-hmm.

20:15.220 --> 20:18.428
Brogan, you have horses.
Jock has horses.

20:18.428 --> 20:21.053
You will move one of your
prized horses next to his

20:21.053 --> 20:23.053
and, under the guise
of visiting,

20:23.053 --> 20:24.512
you will kill Jock's horse.

20:24.512 --> 20:26.428
Okay.
What? Je... No.

20:26.428 --> 20:29.512
No more killing animals.
I was fucking with you.

20:29.512 --> 20:31.220
Okay.

20:31.220 --> 20:33.428
But Jock and Fiske are
in the same stable.

20:33.428 --> 20:35.387
Find out how
that's not a coincidence.

20:35.387 --> 20:37.387
Are their trainers
passing notes for them?

20:37.387 --> 20:39.553
Are payments hidden
in bales of hay?

20:39.553 --> 20:41.887
I don't fucking know,
but you are going to.

20:41.887 --> 20:43.261
And what are you
going to be doing?

20:43.261 --> 20:46.095
Oh. I myself will be doing
my usual boogie...

20:46.095 --> 20:47.970
Inducing mistakes
through temptation,

20:47.970 --> 20:51.470
misdirection, obfuscation and
conflation-slash-corruption

20:51.470 --> 20:54.261
of the ideals that built
this great nation.

20:54.261 --> 20:56.845
For good and noble purpose,
of course.

20:56.845 --> 20:58.261
- Sure.
- Oh, yeah. Of course.

20:58.261 --> 21:01.261
Okay, now, the entire
federal machine

21:01.261 --> 21:03.470
is set against us
and closing in.

21:03.470 --> 21:06.136
So move fast and break Jock.

21:15.845 --> 21:17.804
We followed him to the hospital.

21:17.804 --> 21:19.095
We've been tracking
his little gang,

21:19.095 --> 21:20.637
and they are deep in research on

21:20.637 --> 21:22.804
something to do with you
and elections...

21:22.804 --> 21:25.512
Uh huh.

21:25.512 --> 21:27.720
You have any idea why...

21:27.720 --> 21:29.512
I don't answer your questions.

21:29.512 --> 21:31.303
And you don't waste time
asking 'em.

21:31.303 --> 21:33.345
The more info I have,
the easier I can stop Rhoades.

21:33.345 --> 21:36.637
The way you stop Rhoades
is you keep him off balance.

21:36.637 --> 21:38.261
You can't let him
find his carencia.

21:39.303 --> 21:42.470
God. Do they teach a man nothing
about bullfighting anymore?

21:42.470 --> 21:45.220
Carencia.
Place in a ring

21:45.220 --> 21:46.887
where the bull feels most safe,

21:46.887 --> 21:48.345
where he draws his full power.

21:48.345 --> 21:50.261
The whole afternoon,
the matador is trying

21:50.261 --> 21:51.679
to keep him away from there.

21:51.679 --> 21:53.136
And if he lets up
for one second,

21:53.136 --> 21:54.845
and that bull
finds his carencia...

21:54.845 --> 21:57.220
Well, it doesn't matter
what went before...

21:57.220 --> 21:59.011
Because a goring is coming next.

21:59.011 --> 22:00.470
Understood.

22:00.470 --> 22:02.512
Now, on the subject of
on the run,

22:02.512 --> 22:04.512
what of the lamster,
Rhoades Senior?

22:04.512 --> 22:07.387
FBI is up on his credit cards
and bank accounts.

22:07.387 --> 22:10.553
There was a transaction

22:10.553 --> 22:13.011
at a gas station up the Thruway.

22:13.011 --> 22:15.220
Could be a misdirect.

22:15.220 --> 22:17.845
Well, run it down and wind up
facing the right way.

22:17.845 --> 22:21.136
We want our arms
around that fucker.

22:23.553 --> 22:25.387
Hey.

22:25.387 --> 22:26.720
I need you to liquidate
our position

22:26.720 --> 22:28.929
in Corwell Pharmaceuticals
at the open.

22:28.929 --> 22:31.053
Like fuck you do.

22:31.053 --> 22:33.845
That's my DB stock P
of the year.

22:33.845 --> 22:35.387
Yeah. It's made 9%...
That's solid.

22:35.387 --> 22:36.720
But I need to free up some cash.

22:36.720 --> 22:38.428
Pimp rule 101:

22:38.428 --> 22:41.261
You don't sell your best girl
'til she loses her hip flexion.

22:41.261 --> 22:42.970
- This sucker is still...
- I have to say

22:42.970 --> 22:44.553
that's really gross...

22:44.553 --> 22:46.345
Yeah, Dollar Bill, that's
a really poor analogy.

22:46.345 --> 22:48.136
- Nobody can own...
- They're right.

22:48.136 --> 22:50.095
Do it again, I'm gonna wash
your mouth out with soap.

22:50.095 --> 22:51.637
And I need the cash

22:51.637 --> 22:54.637
to lever up to buy five bill
worth of washer-dryers.

22:54.637 --> 22:57.887
I'll send you a few other
positions to dump out of.

23:00.136 --> 23:03.178
Tell me I'm not fucking crazy.

23:03.178 --> 23:04.595
I can't do that.

23:04.595 --> 23:06.970
Because lying makes me
break out in hives.

23:06.970 --> 23:09.595
Despite your grotesquerie,
you are correct on this one.

23:11.387 --> 23:14.428
So, how long will they
suspend your license for?

23:14.428 --> 23:15.804
It could be up to three years.

23:15.804 --> 23:17.261
Ah. Well.
You can petition to

23:17.261 --> 23:18.929
have it shortened
is what I'm saying.

23:18.929 --> 23:21.428
For good behavior? If I don't
shiv someone in the yard

23:21.428 --> 23:23.178
or use a rock pick
on my cell wall?

23:23.178 --> 23:26.220
So do you regret what you did?

23:26.220 --> 23:28.095
I certainly don't
understand it...

23:28.095 --> 23:29.929
I don't regret it.

23:29.929 --> 23:31.553
It had to be done.

23:31.553 --> 23:34.595
I was trying to advise,
knowing you as I do,

23:34.595 --> 23:38.762
that confessing while making
a deal was the better course.

23:38.762 --> 23:40.679
But you chose only the former...

23:40.679 --> 23:42.387
I guess I had enough
pain and guilt

23:42.387 --> 23:43.929
sloshing around inside me...

23:43.929 --> 23:47.720
I thought it best to just...
throw it all up.

23:47.720 --> 23:49.595
Sure.

23:49.595 --> 23:51.553
The ol' boot and rally.

23:53.261 --> 23:56.470
But on the other side,
your throat burns,

23:56.470 --> 23:57.845
and your mouth
doesn't taste too good.

23:57.845 --> 23:59.804
And you start wondering
if the better course

23:59.804 --> 24:02.136
might've been to
just keep it all down.

24:02.136 --> 24:04.136
You do. You wonder.

24:04.136 --> 24:06.303
But you know you had to.

24:06.303 --> 24:07.303
Right.

24:10.512 --> 24:13.303
Shall I open a bottle then?

24:13.303 --> 24:15.929
Oh.

24:15.929 --> 24:19.261
I don't want this to turn into
a Cassavetes movie.

24:19.261 --> 24:22.428
The drinking, the yelling.

24:24.720 --> 24:26.261
Who said anything about yelling?

24:26.261 --> 24:28.970
Let's not tempt fate.

24:35.345 --> 24:36.887
Alright.

24:40.428 --> 24:43.178
I think Ira is
in for a long night.

24:45.220 --> 24:47.345
We all are.

24:57.303 --> 25:00.095
That the night porter?

25:00.095 --> 25:02.136
Yup.

25:02.136 --> 25:04.136
Well. Let's go.

25:24.637 --> 25:26.470
So how...

25:26.470 --> 25:28.804
One-thousand eighty-two
permutations on the combination.

25:28.804 --> 25:30.929
Should only take two,
three hours.

25:30.929 --> 25:31.970
Are you fucking kid...

25:31.970 --> 25:33.261
Yes.
I'm fucking kidding.

25:35.720 --> 25:37.553
Twenty-nine bucks.

25:39.345 --> 25:40.428
You went to law school.

25:40.428 --> 25:42.387
I also went to school.

25:42.387 --> 25:44.595
They called me
Mr. Magneto.

25:57.261 --> 26:00.261
Magnet again?

26:11.387 --> 26:14.011
System disarmed.

26:14.011 --> 26:16.345
Handy being friends with the FBI.

26:16.345 --> 26:18.428
It's fucking cheating.

26:22.720 --> 26:24.553
I can't believe we came
all the way up here

26:24.553 --> 26:26.595
and we're not even
gonna steal anything.

26:26.595 --> 26:28.720
I told you:
don't fucking steal anything.

26:28.720 --> 26:31.220
And no more talking.
The rest of the place is...

28:11.178 --> 28:12.762
Hey.

28:14.053 --> 28:15.720
Yeah, just...

28:46.053 --> 28:47.887
Fuck.

28:47.887 --> 28:49.887
The tray.

29:10.261 --> 29:13.595
Whew, you feel that?!

29:13.595 --> 29:15.428
Adrenaline shakes?
Fuck yeah.

29:15.428 --> 29:16.679
You get what you need?

29:16.679 --> 29:18.303
I had bits and pieces before,

29:18.303 --> 29:19.679
but it's all spelled out here.

29:19.679 --> 29:22.095
So, yeah, I did.

29:22.095 --> 29:23.095
Let's go.

29:38.011 --> 29:39.845
So you're all good.

29:39.845 --> 29:42.303
I am.

29:42.303 --> 29:44.512
Weird way for us to
come back together...

29:44.512 --> 29:47.053
Ahh, I'm glad we did...

29:47.053 --> 29:50.011
I got a parting gift
for you, baby bro.

29:55.387 --> 29:57.053
From the fucking safe?

29:57.053 --> 29:58.470
I told you.

29:58.470 --> 30:00.470
I couldn't return the dirk
without getting it wet.

30:00.470 --> 30:03.512
Fuck it.

30:04.804 --> 30:06.845
Thanks, Jackie.
For all of it.

30:09.679 --> 30:12.178
See ya.

30:49.553 --> 30:51.970
I'm thinking of
holding office hours.

30:53.261 --> 30:57.595
Uh. Yes, you should be in your
office during working hours.

30:57.595 --> 31:01.220
No.
More like a professore.

31:01.220 --> 31:04.053
Selflessly lowering
his learned mane

31:04.053 --> 31:06.929
so that young matriculants
can climb up his ivory tower,

31:06.929 --> 31:09.887
sit at his feet,
and savor of his erudition.

31:11.720 --> 31:14.887
I shall call it
Compliance Corner.

31:17.095 --> 31:21.220
O-Okay, that's, um,
something you can do.

31:22.679 --> 31:26.845
Only I'm... I'm afraid to.

31:26.845 --> 31:30.428
Or... Or rather I'm afraid
that people won't come.

31:30.428 --> 31:33.553
I'm afraid deep down...
people don't like me.

31:33.553 --> 31:36.220
Don't respect me.

31:36.220 --> 31:38.595
Don't even fear me.

31:41.178 --> 31:42.679
Get the fuck out of here.

31:42.679 --> 31:44.345
You lying sack of coffee beans.

31:44.345 --> 31:45.887
You think
I'm a fucking charity case?

31:45.887 --> 31:48.512
Your problem is overconfidence.

31:48.512 --> 31:51.178
Absolute, unassailable,
unjustified...

31:51.178 --> 31:52.845
Now, now.
Let's be respectful...

31:52.845 --> 31:55.178
And I'm not so hard up
I need handouts from you.

31:57.637 --> 32:00.011
You know, I should have come up
with an actual bad idea.

32:00.011 --> 32:03.929
'Cause Compliance Corner
is just so money...

32:05.178 --> 32:07.261
Out!

32:07.261 --> 32:08.720
What?
It's my money.

32:08.720 --> 32:10.387
It's not technically
your money yet.

32:10.387 --> 32:11.970
- It's mine.
- Oh, my God. Really?

32:11.970 --> 32:13.303
What... Where is
the confusion here?

32:16.261 --> 32:17.970
This is about comp?

32:17.970 --> 32:19.762
About what to say
to you about comp.

32:19.762 --> 32:22.303
What's the issue?
I think it sucks.

32:22.303 --> 32:23.970
You're using
hedge fund social pressure

32:23.970 --> 32:25.845
to dissuade us from
insisting on up-front payment

32:25.845 --> 32:28.970
when, if given that money today,
I could generate more with it.

32:28.970 --> 32:31.470
Plus, the entire choice you've
foisted on us, is a false one.

32:31.470 --> 32:32.929
If you can't afford
full payment,

32:32.929 --> 32:34.970
you could just pay
your most valuable people...

32:34.970 --> 32:37.929
The mois of the world... first.
Are you finished?

32:37.929 --> 32:39.845
Not really. I think
you started this whole place

32:39.845 --> 32:41.053
because Axe took you for granted

32:41.053 --> 32:42.887
and now you're doing the same
thing to us.

32:42.887 --> 32:45.011
It's not like you're short
because you're waiting for

32:45.011 --> 32:46.762
a ship to come in
with beaucoup doubloons.

32:46.762 --> 32:48.136
You're on a revenge jag.

32:48.136 --> 32:49.929
And that's a journey that
requires you to dig two graves...

32:49.929 --> 32:52.261
And neither needs to be mine.

32:52.261 --> 32:54.345
Fuck you, math man.

32:54.345 --> 32:57.011
If you're such a genius,
why can't you count to loyalty?

32:57.011 --> 32:58.428
We've all fucked up.

32:58.428 --> 33:00.720
Maybe not Lauren.
But the rest of us.

33:00.720 --> 33:02.345
And each time,
Taylor's had our back.

33:02.345 --> 33:03.720
They've earned our faith.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.178
But if that concept
doesn't compute,

33:05.178 --> 33:06.804
then yeah...
Remember what happened

33:06.804 --> 33:08.845
when Taylor was on this side
and didn't like it?

33:08.845 --> 33:11.387
They were willing to walk away
and prove they could do better.

33:11.387 --> 33:12.929
Are you willing
to do that? No.

33:12.929 --> 33:15.095
Because you're not a leader.
You're a grumbler.

33:15.095 --> 33:17.136
Well, it's not grumble time.
It's comp time.

33:17.136 --> 33:19.178
Make your choice.
I made mine...

33:19.178 --> 33:23.011
Defer and trust in Taylor...
But you do you.

33:25.553 --> 33:27.470
Defer.

33:27.470 --> 33:29.261
And trust.

33:29.261 --> 33:31.011
Thanks for letting me know.

33:32.553 --> 33:34.053
Kiss ass.

33:39.720 --> 33:41.679
Mnh.

33:41.679 --> 33:43.720
What exactly do we know?

33:43.720 --> 33:45.595
Well, it's a shocker.

33:45.595 --> 33:47.512
Not the shocker...

33:47.512 --> 33:49.178
You know.

33:49.178 --> 33:52.387
One in the stink to all of us.
From Jock.

33:52.387 --> 33:54.178
Seems the man is
not interested in

33:54.178 --> 33:56.053
honoring actual
election results.

33:56.053 --> 33:58.220
Did you put Jock together
with the CEO, Fiske?

33:58.220 --> 34:00.261
Jock did come through for him...

34:00.261 --> 34:01.804
Landing government contracts,

34:01.804 --> 34:03.887
insulating him
from investigations.

34:03.887 --> 34:05.387
But there's no financial trail.

34:05.387 --> 34:07.053
They resist traditional bribes.

34:07.053 --> 34:09.679
The payoff works
a little different.

34:09.679 --> 34:11.094
Rigged elections.

34:11.094 --> 34:13.178
Two governors so far.

34:13.178 --> 34:15.387
And there's a senate seat
coming up in Texas

34:15.387 --> 34:18.219
where they're banking on
the same machines being in play.

34:18.219 --> 34:19.553
Ahh.

34:19.553 --> 34:20.929
Someone down there
will say that?

34:20.929 --> 34:22.844
They'll say there were
massive irregularities

34:22.844 --> 34:25.762
that resolved in a way
so statistically unlikely

34:25.762 --> 34:27.261
that I'd have a better chance

34:27.261 --> 34:29.219
being mistaken for
Matthew McConaughey.

34:29.219 --> 34:31.929
Will anyone go on record about
the voting irregularities?

34:31.929 --> 34:33.261
No fucking way.
You want proof,

34:33.261 --> 34:35.344
you're gonna have to
pick apart the raw votes.

34:35.344 --> 34:36.969
Which they've certified
and buried.

34:36.969 --> 34:39.219
But they are there.

34:39.219 --> 34:41.637
Okay.

34:41.637 --> 34:44.719
You have done well for me,
my gallant knights.

34:49.428 --> 34:51.512
It's me.

34:51.512 --> 34:53.303
I think you know
I wouldn't be calling you

34:53.303 --> 34:55.261
if it weren't important
that we meet...

35:00.804 --> 35:04.762
Hey. Any ideas surface
besides me being the house?

35:04.762 --> 35:06.804
Nope.

35:06.804 --> 35:08.095
Moving forward.

35:08.095 --> 35:09.762
I didn't intend
to pressure you...

35:09.762 --> 35:11.887
Oh.
You did mean to.

35:11.887 --> 35:15.136
But I think you should know:
immune to pressure.

35:15.136 --> 35:16.970
Yeah, but, you should know:

35:16.970 --> 35:18.637
a 'no' is not a deal breaker
with us.

35:18.637 --> 35:20.053
Nah.

35:20.053 --> 35:22.553
It's gonna be great in the end.

35:41.512 --> 35:43.595
I've negotiated a price
to buy Cardinale.

35:43.595 --> 35:45.178
Good.

35:45.178 --> 35:47.345
Well... it's the wrong
type of disgusting.

35:47.345 --> 35:50.595
It ends with a billion,
and it starts with a six.

35:50.595 --> 35:53.136
Well. Lucky for me
I have access to that.

35:53.136 --> 35:55.303
And I've got about a thousand
good loads left in me...

35:55.303 --> 35:58.512
But neither of us should
spend it all in one throw.

36:16.011 --> 36:18.679
What's this, a fucking ambush?

36:18.679 --> 36:20.345
It's an intervention.

36:20.345 --> 36:22.845
You can't do this, tatanka.

36:22.845 --> 36:24.553
If you proceed
to buy this company,

36:24.553 --> 36:27.053
you'll be outside
all risk parameters.

36:27.053 --> 36:30.178
And in violation of
Axe Capital's bylaws.

36:30.178 --> 36:32.345
Not to mention
the opportunity cost,

36:32.345 --> 36:35.261
exiting these positions now
could be a ten figure mistake.

36:35.261 --> 36:38.887
And the main company isn't juicy
enough to squeeze that out of.

36:38.887 --> 36:41.553
You'll be lucky if
Saler's is even standing

36:41.553 --> 36:43.887
after another round
of Taylor's attacks.

36:43.887 --> 36:46.053
The only reason
hedge fund managers

36:46.053 --> 36:47.679
make a move like this is ego.

36:47.679 --> 36:49.261
A legacy play.

36:49.261 --> 36:51.553
To strap themselves
to some noble brand.

36:51.553 --> 36:54.053
But while someone in this
might be trying to do that,

36:54.053 --> 36:56.428
it ain't you.
It's the broad.

36:56.428 --> 36:58.595
Which means you'd have to
notify all the investors

36:58.595 --> 37:00.804
that you're completely
P-whipped.

37:00.804 --> 37:02.470
You all fucking done?

37:03.970 --> 37:07.053
I set the risk parameters,
Spyros... so push them.

37:07.053 --> 37:09.261
They're my bylaws,
I can change them.

37:10.512 --> 37:12.804
I just did.
Paper that, Orrin.

37:12.804 --> 37:15.929
You don't like me selling out
your positions, tough shit.

37:15.929 --> 37:18.553
They aren't your positions
anyway, they're mine.

37:18.553 --> 37:20.595
And if you can't find a way
to pick up the returns...

37:20.595 --> 37:23.095
Then why the fuck are you here
instead of someone who can?

37:23.095 --> 37:26.887
I am the sun that warms you

37:26.887 --> 37:30.095
and the air that
you fucking breathe.

37:30.095 --> 37:31.345
Don't forget it.

37:36.929 --> 37:38.637
I'll change the risk model...

37:38.637 --> 37:41.970
But I'll email myself and Wags
that it was at your direction.

37:41.970 --> 37:44.095
Copy me.

37:44.095 --> 37:45.512
I'll recommend outside counsel

37:45.512 --> 37:47.637
willing to jerk around
your by-laws...

37:47.637 --> 37:50.136
Keep going
and you'll find yourselves

37:50.136 --> 37:52.303
taking a dive
through plate glass.

37:52.303 --> 37:54.136
Continue liquidating.

37:54.136 --> 37:55.762
And close the damn deal.

38:03.261 --> 38:05.470
Axe is in Colonel Kurtz
territory.

38:05.470 --> 38:07.470
He's up the river, walled off
and hunkered down.

38:07.470 --> 38:09.804
You have to go after him.
You're the only one who can.

38:09.804 --> 38:11.970
You're a terrible actor.

38:11.970 --> 38:13.804
Worse than Spyros.

38:13.804 --> 38:17.512
There is literally no way in
which I am worse than Spyros.

38:17.512 --> 38:19.720
Unless you mean worse
as a sycophant and...

38:19.720 --> 38:21.303
no, if I wanted to toadie,

38:21.303 --> 38:23.595
I could stoop lower
and lick boots better.

38:23.595 --> 38:25.595
No.

38:25.595 --> 38:27.053
This is the real deal.

38:27.053 --> 38:28.595
This is why you are here.

38:28.595 --> 38:31.512
Because when fearless leader
forgets every once in a while

38:31.512 --> 38:33.887
that he does need to
fear the almighty...

38:33.887 --> 38:36.178
You bring him back to himself.

38:36.178 --> 38:38.428
You restore equilibrium.

38:38.428 --> 38:42.387
This isn't a fire drill,
it's the Fyre Festival...

38:42.387 --> 38:45.553
And a full on fucking disaster.

38:45.553 --> 38:48.220
He needs you, Wendy.

38:48.220 --> 38:50.220
Okay.

38:50.220 --> 38:52.553
Tell me what I need to know...

38:59.679 --> 39:01.345
I've gotten everyone's
comp decision.

39:01.345 --> 39:02.845
They've all deferred.

39:02.845 --> 39:05.095
Well, everyone's comp decision
but yours.

39:07.136 --> 39:09.011
I want to be paid in full.

39:09.011 --> 39:10.804
Today.

39:10.804 --> 39:13.053
I don't want the money
locked up in the fund.

39:13.053 --> 39:16.345
It's not you, it's me.

39:16.345 --> 39:17.887
In case you break up with me.

39:17.887 --> 39:20.637
I like you too much to be here
if that happened.

39:22.387 --> 39:25.387
You are so good.

39:40.011 --> 39:40.970
You didn't need to.

39:40.970 --> 39:42.970
I was raised well.
Mm.

39:42.970 --> 39:44.595
So.
Why'd you reach out?

39:44.595 --> 39:47.261
Something truly new
or more of the same?

39:47.261 --> 39:49.553
You've known since day one

39:49.553 --> 39:52.178
that Jock Jeffcoat
is not fit by mien, character,

39:52.178 --> 39:55.595
or basic respect for humanity to
lead the Department of Justice.

39:55.595 --> 39:59.095
But he was appointed by
a man who was elected...

39:59.095 --> 40:02.845
So you told yourself a story
about why you had to soldier on.

40:02.845 --> 40:04.512
As did you.

40:04.512 --> 40:06.929
As you would still if
you didn't come at him and lose.

40:09.720 --> 40:12.053
You had a hand in that.

40:12.053 --> 40:13.970
They say if you jump

40:13.970 --> 40:15.512
right before the elevator
hits the ground

40:15.512 --> 40:18.553
that it rips right through you
all the same.

40:18.553 --> 40:20.845
I'm living proof
that ain't the case.

40:24.428 --> 40:28.428
Jock is eyeballs-deep
in election fraud.

40:28.428 --> 40:30.095
Rigging... stealing... elections.

40:30.095 --> 40:31.303
You can prove that?

40:31.303 --> 40:33.136
No. But you can.

40:33.136 --> 40:35.011
You can open a DOJ investigation

40:35.011 --> 40:36.595
and lay your hands on
the raw vote totals.

40:36.595 --> 40:38.679
Jock would snuff that out...
And snuff me out...

40:38.679 --> 40:40.387
Before I saw a single
butterfly ballot.

40:40.387 --> 40:43.428
No. From you,
he'd never see it coming.

40:43.428 --> 40:46.345
You're like that Sade song
come to life Kate...

40:46.345 --> 40:48.845
"Smooth Operator"...

40:48.845 --> 40:51.637
Now, know that's
high praise from me.

40:51.637 --> 40:53.261
Indeed.

40:53.261 --> 40:54.595
If you'll listen to me,

40:54.595 --> 40:57.095
I can coach you on how to
keep this on the DL.

40:57.095 --> 40:59.303
Avoid Jock's detection
until it's too late

40:59.303 --> 41:02.470
for him to do anything
but take it.

41:02.470 --> 41:06.970
You can't like
who Connerty has become.

41:08.345 --> 41:10.220
You can't like who you have.

41:10.220 --> 41:14.178
Use your skills for good again.
For right.

41:14.178 --> 41:17.595
You could've been anything...
You chose to be a prosecutor.

41:20.345 --> 41:23.303
Maybe this

41:23.303 --> 41:25.637
is a reminder of why you did.

41:27.261 --> 41:29.553
Or it'll end up in the trash.

41:29.553 --> 41:31.387
Stop selling.

41:31.387 --> 41:34.387
You're the guy who
taught me everything.

41:39.095 --> 41:41.512
Take me through the steps.
How would you have me work it?

41:41.512 --> 41:43.470
I'm glad you still
feel that way.

41:45.011 --> 41:46.553
You piggyback on
the subpoena power

41:46.553 --> 41:48.970
of an already convened
grand jury...

41:48.970 --> 41:51.303
You think I stole an election?

41:51.303 --> 41:53.011
Chuck thinks that.

41:53.011 --> 41:54.178
Two actually.

41:54.178 --> 41:55.887
Another on the way.

41:55.887 --> 41:57.345
You believe him?

41:58.929 --> 42:01.261
Not a word
out of his lying mouth.

42:01.261 --> 42:03.595
But I thought you should know
his plan of attack.

42:03.595 --> 42:05.387
He wanted me to flow
an investigation

42:05.387 --> 42:07.303
through the
Civil Rights Division...

42:07.303 --> 42:08.970
Knowing that's generally
not an area

42:08.970 --> 42:10.512
where you paid much attention.

42:10.512 --> 42:14.053
Oh. Well, that's a bit
unfair... and a little unkind.

42:14.053 --> 42:17.387
As a young prosecutor, no one
put more Klansmen behind bars.

42:17.387 --> 42:19.637
Even sent a few to the chamber.

42:19.637 --> 42:22.553
Watched 'em wriggle and twitch
without an ounce of sympathy.

42:22.553 --> 42:24.637
Laudable commitment to justice.

42:24.637 --> 42:26.053
Yeah. I have that.

42:26.053 --> 42:27.512
So do you.

42:27.512 --> 42:30.553
With a laudable swath
of ambition as well.

42:30.553 --> 42:32.887
Well, I do have my eye
on the next rung.

42:32.887 --> 42:35.136
Mm-hmm. Well, you can't
have Connerty's job.

42:35.136 --> 42:36.804
Don't want it.

42:36.804 --> 42:38.637
Too much scrutiny from you.

42:40.178 --> 42:44.512
No. I was thinking something
with more maneuvering room.

42:44.512 --> 42:46.762
Head of
the Civil Rights Division.

42:46.762 --> 42:49.845
That'll look good
when you run for office.

42:49.845 --> 42:50.929
Right?

42:50.929 --> 42:53.553
But first, we must
break Chuck's fever.

42:53.553 --> 42:56.345
And the surest route
is apprehending his padre.

42:56.345 --> 42:59.595
So, if you will add your labors
to Connerty's on that.

42:59.595 --> 43:00.595
Hmm.

43:07.553 --> 43:11.428
Cleared out
over two billion today.

43:11.428 --> 43:13.136
I feel like
that's a lot of money.

43:13.136 --> 43:14.553
Even for you.

43:14.553 --> 43:16.261
Yeah. It is.

43:16.261 --> 43:17.762
That's why I'm here.

43:17.762 --> 43:20.762
The truth is,
I can't be your counsel

43:20.762 --> 43:22.470
on destroying Taylor anymore.

43:22.470 --> 43:24.595
That took me to my worst place.

43:24.595 --> 43:26.220
I know.
Why I didn't ask.

43:26.220 --> 43:28.845
But I can still counsel you.

43:28.845 --> 43:31.512
I'm not gonna say,
"Don't compete against Taylor."

43:31.512 --> 43:33.845
But I am gonna say,

43:33.845 --> 43:37.303
compete on the battlefield
you're meant to.

43:37.303 --> 43:40.720
And take solace in beating
Taylor's returns.

43:40.720 --> 43:43.053
That really doesn't
seem like enough.

43:43.053 --> 43:45.845
Yeah. You need an enemy.
Or you think you do.

43:45.845 --> 43:48.053
Like without that
gravitational pull

43:48.053 --> 43:50.178
you'll go flying off
into nothingness.

43:50.178 --> 43:52.637
No edge, no drive.
No Axe.

43:52.637 --> 43:54.428
I don't need an enemy.
I have an enemy.

43:54.428 --> 43:55.845
What if you didn't?

43:55.845 --> 43:57.845
What if you just put this
to fucking bed?

43:57.845 --> 44:01.303
That what you think you did
at the hearing?

44:01.303 --> 44:04.178
In a sense, yes.

44:04.178 --> 44:06.679
Doing the right thing
eventually becomes the thing

44:06.679 --> 44:08.387
that makes you feel right.

44:08.387 --> 44:12.553
It's... It's not the hedonic
experience, believe me...

44:12.553 --> 44:14.595
It doesn't happen quickly.

44:14.595 --> 44:16.553
Doesn't charge you
with endorphins

44:16.553 --> 44:19.970
the way the perfect combo
of salt, fat and sugar does.

44:19.970 --> 44:23.303
But it does last longer.
It does nourish you.

44:23.303 --> 44:25.970
You really feel
all of that already?

44:25.970 --> 44:30.679
Right now I'm a little down
about losing my medical license.

44:30.679 --> 44:32.178
More than a little.

44:32.178 --> 44:36.220
But underneath that...
Yeah, I-I...

44:36.220 --> 44:38.470
I can feel the spark.

44:38.470 --> 44:42.178
I think we might not run
on the same kind of fuel.

44:42.178 --> 44:45.053
Taylor's my responsibility.
I brought them into the world.

44:45.053 --> 44:47.178
I need to be the one
to take them out.

44:47.178 --> 44:49.053
You do have a code.

44:49.053 --> 44:51.887
Rebecca's inside the circle, so
she gets the special treatment.

44:51.887 --> 44:54.053
Taylor's outside, so they get
the other special treatment.

44:54.053 --> 44:58.762
It gasses you up, as you say,
but it doesn't burn clean.

44:58.762 --> 45:00.804
Especially not as we get older.

45:00.804 --> 45:04.970
The only times I've ever
seen you truly fuck yourself

45:04.970 --> 45:08.345
were when you narrowed your
whole gaze to retribution.

45:08.345 --> 45:10.303
That's not happening here.

45:10.303 --> 45:12.679
I see the field.

45:12.679 --> 45:15.512
And I get that vengeance
didn't agree with your system.

45:15.512 --> 45:17.387
But we're built different.

45:17.387 --> 45:20.053
I guess I really have
lost my touch.

45:20.053 --> 45:22.303
Well, just because
I'm not listening to you,

45:22.303 --> 45:26.261
doesn't mean I don't value you.

45:26.261 --> 45:27.804
It really kinda does.

45:32.095 --> 45:35.929
It's thirty hours of labor.
And counting.

45:35.929 --> 45:38.178
She's a fucking
yoga champion, Ira.

45:38.178 --> 45:40.095
What does that have to do
with anything?

45:40.095 --> 45:42.595
I don't know. I just thought
it sounded reassuring.

45:42.595 --> 45:45.679
Hey. She's gonna be fine.

45:45.679 --> 45:47.261
Alright?

45:47.261 --> 45:50.762
I just... can't believe
you're starting all over.

45:50.762 --> 45:55.220
Neither can my kids,
but... I'm not dead.

45:57.011 --> 46:00.345
After every loss, after every
great big kick to the grundle,

46:00.345 --> 46:02.095
we start over.

46:02.095 --> 46:05.303
We fall in love again.
We make new life.

46:05.303 --> 46:07.553
And hopefully new
and different mistakes.

46:09.428 --> 46:11.136
What's the matter?

46:11.136 --> 46:12.553
Dad didn't check in.

46:12.553 --> 46:13.970
You think they have him?

46:15.261 --> 46:16.804
Ooh.

46:16.804 --> 46:20.053
- That sucks.
- Yeah.

46:20.053 --> 46:23.095
...Oh, the amount of goddamned
pot these little girls smoke...

46:24.804 --> 46:27.428
back in the day they'd have
been called 'grasshoppers.'

46:29.011 --> 46:30.970
Well, they're exaggerating
a little.

46:30.970 --> 46:34.136
Me? I never liked
to get too stoned.

46:34.136 --> 46:36.637
Only enough to make you
want to fuck.

46:36.637 --> 46:39.553
Oh. You just need
a nice sativa blend...

46:39.553 --> 46:40.637
A what?

46:47.637 --> 46:51.011
Oh, what's up, little Bess?

46:51.011 --> 46:53.512
FBI! Let me see your hands!

46:55.845 --> 46:58.178
Don't you lay a hand on her!

47:04.929 --> 47:07.637
We are running down
some promising leads and...

47:09.845 --> 47:12.679
This could be the call.

47:12.679 --> 47:14.178
Connerty...

47:17.428 --> 47:19.178
No, I'll be right there.

47:19.178 --> 47:20.637
Good work.

47:20.637 --> 47:23.595
We have him?
Through the woman?

47:23.595 --> 47:26.512
Tied Rhoades Senior to her
via a college account.

47:26.512 --> 47:28.428
Credit card pinged
at an upstate hotel.

47:28.428 --> 47:30.220
Looks like the Thruway hit
was real.

47:30.220 --> 47:31.553
I'm heading there now.

47:31.553 --> 47:32.720
Can you let Jock know?

47:32.720 --> 47:34.553
Easy breezy.

47:34.553 --> 47:37.428
Good luck finishing off
the Rhoadeses.

47:45.637 --> 47:47.220
You don't have to do it.

47:47.220 --> 47:50.720
Nope. I went to war with
my own people on the deal.

47:50.720 --> 47:51.887
Triumphed.

47:51.887 --> 47:55.345
And I am poised
to move on Cardinale.

47:55.345 --> 47:57.512
Should consummate tomorrow AM.

47:57.512 --> 48:00.053
And it means a lot to me
that you would do that.

48:00.053 --> 48:03.178
But, as I said,
you no longer have to.

48:05.178 --> 48:07.136
I thought I would outlast you.

48:07.136 --> 48:10.303
That the other moves would be
beyond your cash reserves...

48:10.303 --> 48:11.929
You were right about that point.

48:11.929 --> 48:13.470
But I was wrong about Axe.

48:13.470 --> 48:15.970
And how far he would go
against me. And for you.

48:15.970 --> 48:19.428
Maybe not this far for either.
But for both?

48:19.428 --> 48:21.303
He's backing me.

48:21.303 --> 48:23.845
In a day's time
I won't need your company.

48:23.845 --> 48:26.261
I can't let that happen.
I'm waving the white flag.

48:26.261 --> 48:27.720
Willing to go back
to supplying you.

48:27.720 --> 48:29.095
Under the old rates?

48:29.095 --> 48:31.428
Just like it was before
I came into the picture.

48:31.428 --> 48:32.679
Tempting.

48:32.679 --> 48:35.970
That would save Saler's...
And Axe... a bundle.

48:35.970 --> 48:39.679
But I would have to make you
a brutal fucking deal.

48:39.679 --> 48:41.512
Take controlling interest
of Kling.

48:41.512 --> 48:43.470
Strip you of all
decision-making.

48:43.470 --> 48:44.804
But without buying me out.

48:44.804 --> 48:47.136
I want you to have flesh
in the game.

48:47.136 --> 48:48.762
Invest me in Saler's wellbeing.

48:48.762 --> 48:51.595
And tie you to any
future suffering

48:51.595 --> 48:53.261
in order to prevent it.

48:53.261 --> 48:55.303
Ingenious.

48:55.303 --> 48:56.428
I'm open to that...

48:56.428 --> 48:59.637
You cut a fucking deal
with Taylor?

48:59.637 --> 49:01.929
I am grateful
that you were willing

49:01.929 --> 49:04.345
to buy me
the Heart of the Ocean...

49:04.345 --> 49:06.720
But a gift like that...
That's too much.

49:06.720 --> 49:09.220
Even if I am the one
who asked for it.

49:09.220 --> 49:12.053
I saw the dynamic change,

49:12.053 --> 49:15.136
the friction that it already
had created between us.

49:15.136 --> 49:16.970
So I let you off the hook.

49:16.970 --> 49:19.261
You also let my arch fucking foe
off the hook.

49:19.261 --> 49:22.053
I wasn't thinking about them.
I was thinking about us.

49:22.053 --> 49:23.637
And your company.

49:23.637 --> 49:25.387
Yes. And that.

49:28.053 --> 49:29.762
C'mon...

49:29.762 --> 49:32.970
You already understand
the wisdom of the move.

49:32.970 --> 49:35.136
And in time, you'll appreciate

49:35.136 --> 49:37.178
that it was the best thing
for everybody.

49:40.970 --> 49:43.011
Let's talk about what you can do

49:43.011 --> 49:46.428
with the few billion that
you don't need to spend anymore.

49:46.428 --> 49:50.512
And why aren't we drinking yet?

50:13.679 --> 50:16.136
Thank you.

50:16.136 --> 50:18.887
Mr. Rhoades, my name
is Waylon Jeffcoat.

50:18.887 --> 50:20.053
I know who the fuck you are.

50:20.053 --> 50:21.637
I thought you might,

50:21.637 --> 50:25.095
yet I thought I'd observe
a familiar courtesy...

50:25.095 --> 50:28.053
Maybe tell you about a few other
courtesies you might not know

50:28.053 --> 50:30.053
are currently being
extended to you.

50:30.053 --> 50:33.428
This is an unofficial,
casual conversation.

50:33.428 --> 50:35.261
You're not under arrest.

50:35.261 --> 50:36.804
If you answer my questions,

50:36.804 --> 50:39.220
it's possible that neither you
nor your boy

50:39.220 --> 50:41.261
need be clapped in iron.

50:41.261 --> 50:44.053
I don't really want that.

50:44.053 --> 50:47.136
I just want Chuck broken.

50:47.136 --> 50:51.345
Stripped of his office,
and his law license,

50:51.345 --> 50:54.804
and this futile vendetta
that he's directed my way.

50:54.804 --> 50:57.595
Where you come from,
maybe you sell your progeny

50:57.595 --> 50:59.929
because there's
not enough polk salad

50:59.929 --> 51:01.679
to feed all the little mouths.

51:01.679 --> 51:06.512
But I'm not saying a damn thing
to help you hurt my boy.

51:08.595 --> 51:11.929
Do you have any idea what
it smells like in prison?

51:11.929 --> 51:14.720
Is it dick?

51:14.720 --> 51:16.387
I'm betting dick.

51:16.387 --> 51:17.804
Well.

51:17.804 --> 51:20.428
That certainly is one of
the notes you will detect.

51:20.428 --> 51:22.804
You, sir, will have
all the time in the world

51:22.804 --> 51:25.470
to dig out every subtlety
off the back of your tongue,

51:25.470 --> 51:28.428
as you will be spending
the rest of your life there.

51:28.428 --> 51:31.095
Away from the people
and the acts that you love.

51:31.095 --> 51:33.762
Everything that you have
spent a lifetime building

51:33.762 --> 51:35.720
will be torn down
by these very hands.

51:35.720 --> 51:38.095
Even before it's finished.

51:40.720 --> 51:43.970
Or... you could keep it.

51:45.970 --> 51:49.929
That Elysian Fields project
of yours.

51:49.929 --> 51:52.970
I could make sure it's shielded
from your criminality.

51:52.970 --> 51:54.929
Which we have
abundant evidence of.

51:54.929 --> 51:56.929
- From the wires...
- Fucking wires...

51:56.929 --> 51:58.303
And from witnesses...

51:58.303 --> 52:00.512
There are no Goddamn witnesses.

52:00.512 --> 52:02.637
Because I haven't committed a crime.

52:06.595 --> 52:08.136
Excuse me.

52:20.011 --> 52:22.679
Ask him about "the idiot."

52:22.679 --> 52:24.261
Who is that?

52:24.261 --> 52:26.512
The guy who secretly brokered
his land deal.

52:26.512 --> 52:29.470
Better: tell him we have the guy.

52:29.470 --> 52:31.261
But who the hell is it?

52:31.261 --> 52:33.804
I don't know. But that's
what he referred to him as.

52:42.679 --> 52:45.553
Okay.

52:45.553 --> 52:47.887
Cards on the table.

52:47.887 --> 52:50.011
The cretin that helped you
snag the land.

52:50.011 --> 52:53.637
Uh. What is it you so lovingly
call him... the idiot?

52:55.679 --> 52:57.178
We have him.

52:57.178 --> 52:59.637
And he's singing like
Hank Williams, the elder.

52:59.637 --> 53:01.679
Telling us all about
your cheatin' heart.

53:04.136 --> 53:06.345
That would be bad news for me.

53:06.345 --> 53:08.261
Yeah.

53:08.261 --> 53:09.553
If it were true.

53:10.804 --> 53:14.762
So... if he's
in the next room,

53:14.762 --> 53:16.887
bring him in.

53:16.887 --> 53:19.220
I can't let you
have that access.

53:19.220 --> 53:21.512
Then just tell me his name.

53:21.512 --> 53:25.053
I'm in the information intake
business, not the reverse.

53:25.053 --> 53:27.929
What I fucking thought.

53:27.929 --> 53:29.387
So... what now?

53:29.387 --> 53:31.679
You gonna hold me
on some trumped up charge

53:31.679 --> 53:32.887
or you gonna turn me loose?

53:32.887 --> 53:36.011
Mm.

53:36.011 --> 53:39.011
I think I'll just
keep you right here.

53:39.011 --> 53:43.887
Get a material witness order.
Ice you.

53:43.887 --> 53:46.011
Until this whole thing
shakes out

53:46.011 --> 53:48.553
cleaner than
a choirboy's pecker.

53:52.595 --> 53:54.428
He jumped when you said it.

53:54.428 --> 53:58.053
Yeah. So we know where
to put the pinch bar...

53:58.053 --> 54:00.095
Only we don't fucking have one.

54:00.095 --> 54:01.804
We don't have the fucking idiot.

54:01.804 --> 54:04.011
We don't even know who
the motherfucker is.

54:04.011 --> 54:08.261
No... but I know
how we can.

54:08.261 --> 54:10.595
It's on the recording.

54:10.595 --> 54:12.637
That the taint team
stonewalled me on.

54:12.637 --> 54:15.428
- The thing's locked up in...
- Well, unlock it, son.

54:15.428 --> 54:18.095
Jesus Christ. The Lord doesn't
put knowledge before us

54:18.095 --> 54:19.637
so that we can remain ignorant.

54:19.637 --> 54:21.220
I'm not legally allowed to...

54:21.220 --> 54:23.220
If I order it,
it's fucking legal.

54:23.220 --> 54:25.887
Now, you get your hands
on that fucking tape...

54:25.887 --> 54:28.136
And that fucking idiot.

54:36.178 --> 54:38.887
We've got to get on the list
for preschool right away.

54:38.887 --> 54:40.804
We will, baby, we will...

55:01.136 --> 55:03.970
There's a word for what it takes
to do what you did.

55:03.970 --> 55:06.303
To reverse yourself like that
on Kling.

55:06.303 --> 55:08.303
Is it being dead tired?
Or beaten?

55:08.303 --> 55:10.720
- Mastery.
- Thank you.

55:10.720 --> 55:13.970
But I think it may also be
a little of the other things.

55:13.970 --> 55:16.845
I'm ready for this war
to finally be over.

55:16.845 --> 55:18.679
Do you think it is?

55:18.679 --> 55:21.345
Well, now that his
girlfriend's company is safe.

55:21.345 --> 55:23.345
I think it just might be.

55:37.970 --> 55:39.387
What's the thing.

55:39.387 --> 55:41.178
You said I could
get back into the game,

55:41.178 --> 55:42.679
if I found something good.

55:42.679 --> 55:43.637
Always.

55:43.637 --> 55:45.136
I think I found it.

55:45.136 --> 55:48.178
Good for Axe Cap.
Good for you.

55:48.178 --> 55:50.136
Maybe bad for someone else
you care about.

55:50.136 --> 55:52.095
But you can weigh that.

55:55.595 --> 55:58.387
Saler's has always had
too much toxic debt.

55:58.387 --> 56:01.428
There was no place
they could really put it.

56:01.428 --> 56:03.053
Until now.

56:03.053 --> 56:05.804
Yeah. Now they do.

56:07.345 --> 56:12.261
You have always been a stone
and steely assassin, Victor.

56:12.261 --> 56:13.762
Born that way.

56:25.387 --> 56:29.095
The kind of destruction
you're considering,

56:29.095 --> 56:30.970
the collateral damage,

56:30.970 --> 56:33.303
the relationships
that'll be ruined

56:33.303 --> 56:37.303
or pushed to the brink...
You ready for all that?

56:37.303 --> 56:40.095
Just to finally see the blood
seeping out of Taylor's armor

56:40.095 --> 56:41.428
onto the battlefield?

56:41.428 --> 56:45.261
If I'm not, why am I
still wearing my armor?

56:47.387 --> 56:50.512
Anything I can do to help?

56:50.512 --> 56:53.053
Not on this. No.

56:53.053 --> 56:55.345
Go find Wendy.

56:55.345 --> 56:58.970
No one knows better than you how
to pad the blow of a shitty day.

57:35.762 --> 57:39.470
Two Carte Blanche. Enjoy.

57:39.470 --> 57:41.428
I don't know if you're aware,

57:41.428 --> 57:43.845
but I am also
an unlicensed doctor.

57:43.845 --> 57:46.387
A medicine man of sorts,

57:46.387 --> 57:49.470
and surgeon
of the drinking arts.

57:49.470 --> 57:51.470
I'm going to place
a steady stream

57:51.470 --> 57:53.637
of prescribed medications
before you...

57:53.637 --> 57:56.428
And you are going to quaff
deeply and repeatedly.

57:56.428 --> 57:59.845
And a little flicker
of the warm and giddy

57:59.845 --> 58:02.679
will grow and spread.

58:02.679 --> 58:05.679
And we will laugh
about the days of yore.

58:05.679 --> 58:08.595
And we will toast the comrades
who have fallen

58:08.595 --> 58:10.178
and yet may fall.

58:10.178 --> 58:12.303
And you will forget
the vicissitudes

58:12.303 --> 58:14.553
of the last few days

58:14.553 --> 58:19.637
and you will remember
who you are.

58:19.637 --> 58:22.136
And who's that?

58:22.136 --> 58:25.095
The only woman I've ever
enjoyed drinking with.

58:28.887 --> 58:32.345
Well, then there's one thing
we should do...

58:32.345 --> 58:34.303
Get properly fucking drunk.
