-A band? Can I be in it?

Er, son, rock 'n' roll may  seem  easy,

-but it actually takes a lot of work.
-And lessons.

-before I became a rock god.
-And I didn't just wake up

and earn a partial scholarship
to play in a college marching band.

What do you play?

Nothing cool. Not a rock instrument.
I don't want to talk about it!

03:28.082 --> 03:32.045
Don't repeat my mistakes, Tim.
You learn to rock that cool keyboard.

03:32.128 --> 03:34.380
But piano lessons
sound like summer school.

03:34.505 --> 03:35.924
And Danny Petrosky told me

03:36.007 --> 03:38.301
summer school makes your eyes
crust over with eye boogers.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.553
And then, you have to go
to the eye dentist every Saturday

03:40.637 --> 03:42.472
to get a surgery to clean them out!

03:42.555 --> 03:46.142
Danny Petrosky eats boogers
on sandwich bread.

[groans] Oh-hh! Piano lessons!

03:54.067 --> 03:56.236
They're gonna suck up
the rest of our summer fun time

like a summer-sucking monster
that sucks summer with a suck mouth!

03:59.697 --> 04:01.950
[sighs] How am I gonna get out of this?

04:02.033 --> 04:04.035
Hold on. I'm formulating a thought.

04:04.535 --> 04:06.704
Formulate faster!
The suck monster's coming.

04:06.871 --> 04:08.039
[sucking]

04:08.122 --> 04:08.957
Stop sucking.

04:09.290 --> 04:12.961
Mom never asks  you  to do the dishes.
I assume there's a reason for that?

04:13.169 --> 04:16.547
Yeah. I had butter all over my hands,
so I dropped and broke them all.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.216
Why would you--? Ugh. Never mind.

04:18.299 --> 04:20.051
I had a bunch of butter packets
in my pockets--

04:20.218 --> 04:21.261
I said, never mind.

04:21.344 --> 04:24.430
Point is, being terrible
can get you out of anything.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.099
-I'll get the butter.
-Forget the butter.

04:26.182 --> 04:29.811
Tomorrow, you're going to be
so tremendously bad at the piano,

04:29.894 --> 04:32.855
no one will ever want to hear you
punch the ivories again.

04:32.939 --> 04:36.484
-I thought it was "tickle the ivories."
-Not the way you're gonna play.

04:38.903 --> 04:42.407

04:53.084 --> 04:55.795
I figure we'll start
with some Monte Carlo slot cars,

04:55.878 --> 04:59.173
then engage in a Football Mike
versus dinosaur counterinsurgency--

04:59.257 --> 05:01.926
Maybe later this week,
on a non-lesson day, of course.

05:02.218 --> 05:03.052
What lessons?

05:03.136 --> 05:05.346
[gasps] Did the plan backfire?
Too much butter?

05:05.805 --> 05:09.142
-I just kind of really liked the lesson.
-Nonsense!

05:09.267 --> 05:12.395
You like hill-rolling
and subsequent shrub regurgitation.

05:12.562 --> 05:15.023
Can we talk about this later?
I'm gonna take my nap.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.401
Your  nap? You haven't taken a nap
as long as I've known you.

05:18.609 --> 05:21.404
Mr. Grossman said naps
will help my fingers get stronger.

05:21.487 --> 05:24.741

05:41.591 --> 05:43.634
Wait, we're walking to my lesson?

05:43.718 --> 05:45.636
Rock 'n' roll is a marathon, my man.

05:46.095 --> 05:49.682
Takes a lot of cardio to scream
"Oh, yeah!" for two hours.

05:49.974 --> 05:54.645
Plus, it gives us time to talk T 'N' T,
Templeton and the Templetons.

05:54.729 --> 05:58.399
It works on everything--
airbrushed van sides, tattoos.

05:58.691 --> 06:00.651
Those are totally rock 'n' roll.

06:00.735 --> 06:03.237
-Do you have any tattoos?
-Kind of.

06:03.321 --> 06:06.282
I sat on an ink pen when I was a kid.
It broke skin,

06:06.365 --> 06:10.036
so now I have a tattoo
of a small blue dot on my butt.

06:10.119 --> 06:11.662
That's so crackerjack!

06:12.371 --> 06:14.123
"Crackerjack"? Who says--

06:14.207 --> 06:17.543
Shh! It's a shooshy stealth mission!
Cruddy poop pants, look!

06:18.795 --> 06:21.464
Old people!
Oh, I should have suspected!

06:21.964 --> 06:25.718

to pay for, on  their  salaries?

Shh! Something's happening.

07:04.715 --> 07:08.845
Maybe he needs to loosen up,
have some fun with it, let it rock out.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.180
Oh, I know, his dad can accompany him.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.599

They seem distant.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.644
Won't play ponies with you anymore.

08:39.769 --> 08:43.606
My hunch was right!
This is all a Consortium of Ancients plot!

08:43.689 --> 08:47.401
They use piano lessons to get private time
with our big brothers and sisters

08:47.485 --> 08:49.779
so they can turn them against us babies.

08:49.862 --> 08:52.073
That seems needlessly complicated.

08:52.365 --> 08:55.117
-[babbling]
-Yep, got it. Listen, Dina, is it?

08:55.201 --> 08:58.246
We'd love to actually observe
your sisters' changed behavior.

08:59.789 --> 09:02.625
Oh, great. Your grandmothers
will show us where to find your sisters?

Those  are  your sisters?

09:05.169 --> 09:06.045

The Consortium isn't just taking
our big brothers and sisters away,

09:10.258 --> 09:13.594
they're turning them
into junior old people.

Hey, hon, I was taking a trip
down memory lane

09:25.064 --> 09:26.607
with your old college yearbook.

09:26.691 --> 09:29.485
Funny, all the marching band pages
have been torn out.

09:29.569 --> 09:33.614
You're not gonna find anything
worth finding. You might as well quit.

Mr. G warned me this could happen.
My back's getting sore.

Can you fetch me some liniment, Dad?

09:43.457 --> 09:47.086
Uh, let me see what we've got
in the... liniment cabinet.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.631

into a mini-geezer!

I tell you. A screw loose!

My cousin's stepdad just patched up
their above-ground pool.

10:03.561 --> 10:06.856
And they have snakes.
It's like swimming in the Amazon.

10:07.064 --> 10:08.983
Rain check. I have to practice my piano.

10:09.108 --> 10:12.903
Bring it. I'll grab my guitar.
Poolside snake jam!

10:13.029 --> 10:15.156
Why does everyone want to jam with me?

10:15.239 --> 10:19.243

21:48.682 --> 21:49.808
-Mom!
-Shh!

21:49.891 --> 21:53.770
I wouldn't call Mommy and Daddy
if I were you.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.856
Or Baby Corp.

-That's right, Boss Baby.

21:59.067 --> 22:00.652
[laughing]

22:00.736 --> 22:03.572
I know everything.

22:03.864 --> 22:05.198
Stinkless Serum!

22:05.365 --> 22:08.869
The plan was to have Grossman
make you bring it to me

22:08.952 --> 22:12.414
once you went under his ragtime spell.

22:12.664 --> 22:15.542
-That seems needlessly complicated.
-I agree.

22:15.625 --> 22:19.838
So I just waltzed in here
and took it myself.

22:20.088 --> 22:23.425
Plus, free cookies!

22:23.508 --> 22:24.426
Not my cookies!

22:24.509 --> 22:26.219
[crunching, chuckling]

22:26.303 --> 22:30.015
Smell you later, Boss.
You won't be smelling me.

22:30.098 --> 22:32.100
[laughing, sputtering]

22:32.851 --> 22:35.812
Oh-- uh, after that.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.233
Ugh! Cream of Wheat.
