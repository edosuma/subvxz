00:06.269 --> 00:09.540
<i>Americans have had a
long love affair with their cars...</i>

00:09.541 --> 00:13.874
<i>Road trips, tailgating,
family vacations...</i>

00:13.875 --> 00:16.432
<i>But these days, not so much.</i>

00:16.433 --> 00:19.429
America is
treating its cars

00:19.430 --> 00:21.893
Like an old wife
it's sick of sleeping with,

00:21.894 --> 00:24.529
'cause maybe
she's gained a little weight

00:24.530 --> 00:26.672
Or stopped taking care
of herself.

00:26.673 --> 00:28.844
No offense, frances.

00:28.845 --> 00:30.379
None taken?

00:30.380 --> 00:32.445
America's bored
with their cars,

00:32.445 --> 00:34.779
And we need a little p.R.
To fix that.

00:34.780 --> 00:37.278
Everybody give a big hand

00:37.279 --> 00:39.511
To our new
customer relations supervisor...

00:39.512 --> 00:41.649
Frances heck.
Oh.

00:41.650 --> 00:43.319
From now on, frances,

00:43.320 --> 00:45.989
You're responsible
for writing birthday cards

00:45.990 --> 00:49.627
To all the cars we've sold
over the last ten yes.

00:49.628 --> 00:52.765
I'm writing birthday cards
to cars?

00:52.766 --> 00:55.433
You have until next week
to do 5,000.

00:55.434 --> 00:57.702
Congratulations
on your promotion.

01:00.041 --> 01:02.642
Shall we toast
to your new promotion?

01:02.643 --> 01:04.979
I know, right?
More busywork I don't need.

01:04.980 --> 01:07.514
Which reminds me,
I got roped into volunteering

01:07.515 --> 01:11.653
In brick's class tomorrow, so you're gonna
have to do it. No, I don't think I am.

01:11.654 --> 01:14.422
Come on. You're always
saying you're looking

01:14.423 --> 01:18.393
For more ways to get involved. No, I don't
think I've ever said that once in my entire life.

01:18.394 --> 01:20.628
Hey, mom? Do you think
you could make me

01:20.629 --> 01:23.666
My favorite dinner on Saturday?
I can hardly think to tomorrow.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.634
How about you ask me Friday

01:25.635 --> 01:28.171
About what we're having
for dinner on Saturday?

01:28.172 --> 01:29.673
Okay. I will.

01:29.674 --> 01:31.709
Okay.

01:31.710 --> 01:34.812
I'll ask you Friday.
I'll do that.

01:34.813 --> 01:36.914
Definitely.

01:36.915 --> 01:38.449
Okay!

01:38.450 --> 01:41.351
Friday then!

01:47.424 --> 01:49.358
Th...

01:49.359 --> 01:50.959
Th...

01:50.960 --> 01:54.528
"the." the word's "the,"
just like last time.

01:54.529 --> 01:55.796
Still "the."

01:55.797 --> 01:57.264
I don't think so.

01:57.265 --> 01:59.465
Well,
I'm pretty sure I'm right.

02:01.636 --> 02:03.637
Ugh, this is a hard one.

02:03.638 --> 02:06.306
Guys, we've been
on the same page for 20 minutes.

02:06.307 --> 02:08.208
I'll tell you what.

02:08.209 --> 02:10.544
<i>Why doesn't ick read a page
to you guys,</i>

02:10.545 --> 02:13.181
Just to get
a little momentum going?

02:15.117 --> 02:17.451
"and then, as if in a dream,

02:17.452 --> 02:19.152
"a mysterious specter

02:19.153 --> 02:22.388
"rose from... The darkness,

02:22.389 --> 02:24.657
"a brilliant light

02:24.658 --> 02:27.893
Emanating from its golden
and splendiferous orb."

02:27.894 --> 02:29.428
Did he memorize that?

02:29.429 --> 02:31.397
No. It's just what he does.

02:31.398 --> 02:35.100
He's been reading like that nce he
was 2. Brick is really something.

02:35.101 --> 02:37.269
He can't remember
to throw his lunch away

02:37.270 --> 02:39.271
Or pull up his pants,

02:39.272 --> 02:41.506
But then he has a victory
like last week,

02:41.507 --> 02:43.641
And you almost forget
the other things.

02:43.642 --> 02:45.676
He had a victory?
What kind of victory?

02:45.677 --> 02:47.778
Oh, I thought you knew.

02:47.779 --> 02:49.879
He won
the school-wide spelling bee.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.048
School-wide.

02:56.019 --> 02:58.587
"dear beige hatchback,

02:58.588 --> 03:02.725
I can't believe
you're another year older."

03:02.726 --> 03:06.028
Hey, mom. I was thinking
I might want to have,

03:06.029 --> 03:08.831
Like, eight or nine friends
sleep over this Saturday.

03:08.832 --> 03:11.968
I mean, unless you've got
something else planned.

03:11.969 --> 03:14.204
I don't know.
It's kind of a crazy week.

03:14.205 --> 03:16.439
A big sleepover
isn't really a good idea.

03:16.440 --> 03:17.941
Yeah, you're right.

03:17.942 --> 03:19.409
Crazy week.

03:19.410 --> 03:22.345
Sure. I understand.

03:22.346 --> 03:23.946
Crazy week.

03:23.947 --> 03:26.548
Mom thinks a sleepover's
not a good idea,

03:26.549 --> 03:29.951
So I'm gonna think
of something else.

03:29.952 --> 03:31.886
Okay, you do that.

03:31.887 --> 03:35.422
Frankie, do you have any idea
how smart this kid is?

03:35.423 --> 03:37.657
He's light-years ahead
of the other kids.

03:37.658 --> 03:39.759
They're idiots
next to him.

03:39.760 --> 03:42.729
Tell her, brick. Tell her how stupid
they are. They're pretty stupid.

03:42.730 --> 03:44.798
Mike.
Sorry. I'm excited.

03:44.799 --> 03:47.634
Did you know our boy won
the school-wide spelling bee?

03:47.635 --> 03:49.136
Brick, that's great!

03:49.137 --> 03:51.071
Why didn't you say anything?

03:51.072 --> 03:53.941
Did they give you a certificate
or something? âª da da da âª

03:53.942 --> 03:55.909
It was no big deal.

03:55.910 --> 03:59.046
You hear this kid? No big
deal? He beat fifth graders.

03:59.047 --> 04:00.847
And he qualified
for the orson county bee

04:00.848 --> 04:03.617
At the elks this Saturday,
and if he wins that,

04:03.618 --> 04:06.387
Midwest regionals in chigo
next week, and if he wins that,

04:06.388 --> 04:09.723
The scripps spelling bee
in washington, D.C.

04:09.724 --> 04:12.226
We got a champ here!
Heck! Heck! Heck!

04:13.895 --> 04:17.331
Yeah, I don't think I'm
gonna do it. What? Why not?

04:17.332 --> 04:20.201
Well, it's Saturday.
Saturday's my day to decompress.

04:20.202 --> 04:22.103
Look, brick,

04:22.103 --> 04:24.206
The overlap between
things you're good at

04:24.207 --> 04:27.108
And things people give out
trophies for... Is pretty small.

04:27.109 --> 04:30.377
You gotta do this, son.
You have a gift!

04:30.378 --> 04:32.514
<i>Wow. I'd never seen
mike like this</i>

04:32.515 --> 04:34.749
<i>About anything
not sports-related.</i>

04:34.750 --> 04:36.618
<i>But it sort of makes sense.</i>

04:36.619 --> 04:38.786
<i>See, when you're a parent
of brick,</i>

04:38.787 --> 04:41.222
<i>You spend a lot of time with
your face looking like this...</i>

04:44.559 --> 04:46.826
<i>So if mike had a chance
to look like this...</i>

04:46.827 --> 04:50.229
<i>You can't blame him
for wanting to run with it.</i>

04:50.230 --> 04:52.498
<i>For the next week,
mike coached him</i>

04:52.499 --> 04:55.634
<i>Like he'd never been coached before.
Are you ready to spell?</i>

04:55.635 --> 04:57.869
I'm ready to spell.
I can't hear you!

04:57.870 --> 04:59.337
I'm ready to spell!

04:59.338 --> 05:01.173
"Perspicacious."

05:01.174 --> 05:05.443
P-e-r-s-p-i-c-a-c-i-o-u-s.

05:05.444 --> 05:06.878
"Perspicacious."

05:06.879 --> 05:08.780
Is that right?

05:08.781 --> 05:09.881
Attaboy!

05:11.751 --> 05:13.652
"Onomatopoeia."

05:13.653 --> 05:18.691
O-n-o-m-a-t...

05:18.692 --> 05:21.226
O-p-o-e-i-a.

05:21.227 --> 05:22.594
Onomatopoeia.

05:22.595 --> 05:24.863
That's correct!

05:24.864 --> 05:27.966
<i>Yep, for all the crap
you go through being a parent,</i>

05:27.967 --> 05:29.468
<i>There are some moments</i>

05:29.469 --> 05:31.870
<i>You just know
you're doing something right...</i>

05:31.871 --> 05:33.771
He won.

05:33.772 --> 05:35.306
Your brother won.

05:35.307 --> 05:37.876
Brick heck, ture champ.
He's heading for regionals.

05:37.877 --> 05:40.846
<i>Which are inevitably
followed by other moments.</i>

05:40.847 --> 05:44.883
âª happy birthday to me âª

05:50.089 --> 05:51.790
That's why
you kept asking

05:51.791 --> 05:54.592
About a slumber party
and your favorite dinner.

05:54.593 --> 05:56.927
Why didn't you just say
it was for your birthday?

05:56.928 --> 05:58.862
I didn't think I had to!

05:58.863 --> 06:00.930
I thought mothers just
automatically remember

06:00.931 --> 06:02.665
The day
their children are born.

06:02.666 --> 06:05.968
I'm sorry. There's no excuse.

06:05.969 --> 06:08.170
But I had a lot on my plate!

06:08.171 --> 06:10.940
All you were doing all week
was writing birthday cards!

06:10.941 --> 06:12.608
You remembered
a station wagon's birthday,

06:12.609 --> 06:14.277
But not mine?

06:14.278 --> 06:16.545
Honey, your mother and I
are sorry. We feel terrible.

06:16.546 --> 06:19.249
We'll make it up to you.
Anything you want.

06:19.250 --> 06:21.150
You name it,
and it's yours.

06:21.151 --> 06:23.019
Can we celebrate my birthday
next weekend?

06:25.288 --> 06:26.722
Sure!

06:26.723 --> 06:28.757
If you don't mind
celebrating...

06:28.758 --> 06:30.659
In Chicago.

06:30.660 --> 06:32.528
Oh, my God!

06:32.529 --> 06:35.531
We're going to chicago
for my birthday?

06:35.532 --> 06:38.467
We sure are.
And for brick's spelling bee.

06:38.468 --> 06:40.202
Oh, can we go
to water tower place

06:40.203 --> 06:42.604
And the art institute? We can
drive by them on the way to the bee.

06:42.605 --> 06:44.439
Oh, my God!

06:44.440 --> 06:47.208
Are you guys trying to
pass off brick's spelling bee

06:47.209 --> 06:49.144
As my birthday present?!

06:49.145 --> 06:51.912
No! Sure, we'll go
to the bee while we're there,

06:51.913 --> 06:54.582
But your present is
that you get to be in charge

06:54.583 --> 06:56.484
Of the whole trip!

06:56.485 --> 06:58.018
The whole trip?

06:58.019 --> 06:59.987
I'm listening.

06:59.988 --> 07:02.356
Every decision on the way
will be yours.

07:02.357 --> 07:04.324
Where we eat,
where we stay...

07:04.325 --> 07:06.592
It's all up to you,
my sweet girl

07:06.593 --> 07:09.028
Because we love you
and it's your birthday

07:09.029 --> 07:11.630
And we feel very, very guilty.

07:11.631 --> 07:14.032
Oh! I want to stay mad,

07:14.033 --> 07:16.334
But this is better than
a slumber party

07:16.335 --> 07:18.703
Or chicken parmesan.

07:18.704 --> 07:19.870
Road trip!

07:19.871 --> 07:22.172
Road trip!

07:22.173 --> 07:24.507
<i>Chicken parmesan...
that's her favorite.</i>

07:24.508 --> 07:27.143
<i>Oh, I was way off.</i>

07:27.144 --> 07:29.579
Well, why did we have
to get up so early?

07:29.580 --> 07:31.848
You interrupted my R.E.M. Sleep.

07:31.849 --> 07:35.018
My whole body clock's gonna be off. Only
clock that matters is mine and your brother's.

07:35.019 --> 07:36.986
We're on a schedule here.

07:36.987 --> 07:39.489
We need brick rested
and in the motel by 5:00.

07:39.490 --> 07:42.692
He's got a big day tomorrow.
Big weekend for him. And me

07:42.693 --> 07:45.029
My clock matters. And sue
because it's her birthday weekend.

07:45.030 --> 07:46.931
Right. Sorry.
And sue.

07:46.932 --> 07:48.232
My clock matters. And sue because
it'si'm gonna get postcards

07:48.233 --> 07:51.269
From every fun thing we do
for my birthday weekend,

07:51.270 --> 07:54.306
And mom's gonna help me make 'em into a
scrapbook. Awesome. I'm gonna take pictures

07:54.307 --> 07:56.875
Of every lame thing we do
on ts lame weekend,

07:56.876 --> 08:00.012
And then mom can look to them
for clues as to why I ran away.

08:00.013 --> 08:02.214
Brick, you cool enough?
Crack the window.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.683
Gotta keep that noggin
oxygenated.

08:04.684 --> 08:06.752
Spell "oxygenated."
mike...

08:06.753 --> 08:08.653
Actually, I think
I, the birthday girl,

08:08.654 --> 08:10.355
Might enjoy a window, too.

08:10.356 --> 08:13.425
Axl, switch with me. No way.
I'm not sitting on the hump.

08:13.426 --> 08:16.027
Axl, you can call the shots
when we forget your birthday.

08:16.028 --> 08:17.796
Get on the hump.

08:17.797 --> 08:19.797
Hey, who's up for singing?

08:21.900 --> 08:23.768
âª the hecks went traveling âª

08:23.769 --> 08:25.837
âª to chicago one day âª

08:25.838 --> 08:27.706
âª when along came
an avalanche âª

08:27.707 --> 08:30.542
âª interrupting their way âª

08:30.543 --> 08:32.144
I wish.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.479
âª oh, they went... âª

08:34.480 --> 08:36.748
I'm not singing!

08:36.749 --> 08:39.418
<i>It's my birthday trip.</i>

08:41.000 --> 08:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:53.366 --> 08:57.535
Now "this land is your land," in a round!
Dad, do you think you could pick up some speed

08:57.536 --> 09:00.172
So that when I hurl myself
out of the car,

09:00.173 --> 09:03.174
I actually kill myself instead
of just being injured? Sure.

09:03.175 --> 09:05.776
I'm hungry.
Hungry.

09:05.777 --> 09:08.112
Brick's hungry.
What snack did you pack?

09:08.113 --> 09:10.547
I've got pretzels, candy corn,
cheese corn, kettle corn,

09:10.548 --> 09:13.483
Girl scout cookies
and frosting for dipping.

09:13.484 --> 09:15.985
It's all in the blue bag.

09:15.986 --> 09:19.022
You forgot the blue bag?!

09:19.023 --> 09:21.657
It's okay! Look,
"bicentennial diner, 30 miles."

09:21.658 --> 09:24.159
We're not stopping.
I want to get to the hotel

09:24.160 --> 09:26.028
Early tonight
so brick can get his rest.

09:26.029 --> 09:29.030
We can drive through somewhere.
But it said they had candle dipping.

09:29.031 --> 09:31.800
That would be an
awesome postcard.

09:31.801 --> 09:35.570
And birthday girl does
get to pick the activities.

09:35.571 --> 09:37.538
We did promise her, mike.

09:37.539 --> 09:39.674
And besides, the sign said
their food is "revolutionary."

09:41.844 --> 09:43.745
This is gross.

09:43.746 --> 09:46.214
I think I'm eating
a potpie from 1776.

09:46.215 --> 09:48.550
Well, I love
my "ye old cobb salad."

09:48.551 --> 09:50.953
They don't have
candle dipping...

09:50.954 --> 09:52.888
Or postcards.

09:52.889 --> 09:55.557
Now I'll have nothing
to remember this place by.

09:55.558 --> 09:58.260
Aw, cheer up.
Maybe you'll get hepatitis.

09:58.261 --> 10:01.530
Oh, well.
You guys are so gonna love

10:01.531 --> 10:03.465
The next place
on the birthday trip.

10:03.466 --> 10:06.134
I read in the aaa trip-tik
that indiana is home

10:06.135 --> 10:08.736
To the world's largest
oak tree stump!

10:08.737 --> 10:10.271
Cool!
Lame.

10:10.272 --> 10:12.339
It's the eighth wonder
of muncie!

10:12.340 --> 10:14.741
I bet no one at home
has a postcard

10:14.742 --> 10:16.542
From the world's
largest stump.

10:16.543 --> 10:19.278
Why do you think
that is, sue? Why?

10:19.279 --> 10:22.214
We have to get to the motel,
get brick a nice hot bath,

10:22.215 --> 10:24.017
Go over the flash cards
and get him into bed.

10:24.018 --> 10:26.253
No way we're gonna do that
if we drive an hour and a half

10:26.254 --> 10:29.323
Out of our way to look
at some stump.

10:39.033 --> 10:41.401
I had the lowest
of expectations,

10:41.402 --> 10:44.371
And I'm still disappointed.

10:46.971 --> 10:49.840
<i>So Sue's little side trips
had landed us in Chicago</i>

10:49.841 --> 10:52.343
<i>Smack in the middle
of rush hour.</i>

10:52.344 --> 10:54.745
<i>But three cranky hours later,
we finally made it</i>

10:54.746 --> 10:57.413
<i>To the motels we had picked.</i>

10:57.414 --> 10:59.815
Oh... My... God.

10:59.816 --> 11:02.484
Sue should never be allowed
to decide anything again

11:02.485 --> 11:05.087
In our entire lives! This place
makes our house look nice!

11:05.088 --> 11:06.955
Axl.

11:06.956 --> 11:10.191
Uh, well...
See, it's not so bad!

11:10.192 --> 11:11.726
There's a tv.

11:11.727 --> 11:14.796
And the bathroom is...

11:14.797 --> 11:16.831
There's poop in the toilet!

11:16.832 --> 11:18.332
Aw, man!
Ew!

11:18.333 --> 11:20.969
Aw, gross! All right.
We'll just flush it.

11:20.970 --> 11:22.904
It's not a big deal. My God!

11:25.074 --> 11:27.742
Mike, I need help!

11:27.743 --> 11:29.677
And towels!

11:29.678 --> 11:32.613
Oh. Watch tv.

11:38.053 --> 11:39.687
The tv doesn't work.

11:39.688 --> 11:42.256
What did you say?

11:42.257 --> 11:43.891
The tv doesn't work.

11:43.892 --> 11:45.559
See? It's just static.

11:47.062 --> 11:49.163
Well, thank you, sue,

11:49.164 --> 11:51.331
For the worst vacation
we've ever had,

11:51.332 --> 11:54.501
And I am including the ozarks
and the frog infestation.

11:54.502 --> 11:56.737
I mean, come on, people!
You know we're all thinking it!

11:56.738 --> 11:57.839
Hey, we could spend all night

11:57.840 --> 11:59.074
Criticizing
sue's lousy decisions,

11:59.075 --> 12:02.044
But we need some sleep,
so start sleeping now!

12:12.318 --> 12:14.721
Sue, knock it off!

12:14.722 --> 12:16.656
Go to sleep.

12:16.657 --> 12:18.625
Okay.

12:20.761 --> 12:22.496
You happy now?

12:22.497 --> 12:24.831
Sue's crying,
and you're yelling at her.

12:24.832 --> 12:26.466
I wasn't yelling.

12:26.467 --> 12:28.968
I don't want her
to wake up brick.

12:28.969 --> 12:31.404
Yeah, that's right.
It's all about brick.

12:31.405 --> 12:33.406
That's why he gets the bed,

12:33.407 --> 12:35.809
And I'm sleeping on this
disgusting, crunchy carpet.

12:35.810 --> 12:38.244
No, we're sleeping on this
disgusting, crunchy carpet

12:38.245 --> 12:40.880
Because you had to give
the other bed to sue.

12:40.881 --> 12:43.249
We forgot her birthday.

12:43.250 --> 12:46.285
I know. But this wasn't the
way to make it up to her.

12:46.286 --> 12:48.254
This weekend is
about the spelling bee.

12:48.255 --> 12:51.190
The spelling bee is a big deal. To who?

12:51.191 --> 12:53.492
What's that supposed
to mean?

12:53.493 --> 12:55.427
It's a big deal to you.

12:55.428 --> 12:58.029
You're the one that
wants the trophy.

12:58.030 --> 13:00.732
You're the one that wants
to win! That's ridiculous.

13:00.733 --> 13:02.934
Don't you roll away from me!
It's true!

13:02.935 --> 13:05.270
You've been out of control
this whole weekend.

13:05.271 --> 13:07.705
I'm not the one agreeing
to every half-baked idea

13:07.706 --> 13:11.275
My 13-year-old comes up
with. 14. She had a birthday.

13:11.276 --> 13:14.277
<i>I can hear you.
I can hear you.</i>

13:14.278 --> 13:16.779
I can hear you.

13:16.780 --> 13:18.748
I can hear you!

13:20.750 --> 13:24.719
Sue, come on!

13:24.720 --> 13:26.387
It's me.

13:26.388 --> 13:29.056
I just wanted
to make everybody happy.

13:29.057 --> 13:32.059
Oh, man!

13:36.133 --> 13:38.168
<i>I read something
somewhere about...</i>

13:38.202 --> 13:41.138
<i>"no matter how dark the night,
the sun comes up..."</i>

13:41.172 --> 13:43.640
<i>And something, something...
Anyway, the sun came up,</i>

13:43.674 --> 13:46.777
<i>And it sure didn't make
that room look any better.</i>

13:46.811 --> 13:48.512
<i>But then...</i>

13:48.546 --> 13:50.848
Happy birthday.

13:58.323 --> 14:00.224
Oh, doughnut holes?

14:00.258 --> 14:03.126
I had to drive 10 miles
up the road to find 'em,

14:03.160 --> 14:05.962
But, yeah, I know
they're your favorite. Aw!

14:05.997 --> 14:07.264
Thanks, dad.

14:07.298 --> 14:09.933
I'm sorry if I was short
with you last night.

14:09.967 --> 14:12.435
I know this hasn't been
a great birthday,

14:12.470 --> 14:14.704
And I'm sorry for that,
too.

14:14.739 --> 14:16.940
How about,
when we get home,

14:16.974 --> 14:19.242
We throw you
a nice, big party?

14:19.276 --> 14:21.378
Really?

14:24.416 --> 14:25.950
We okay?

14:25.984 --> 14:28.619
Mm-hmm, we're okay.

14:28.654 --> 14:31.423
But, dad?
Yeah, honey?

14:31.458 --> 14:33.559
Doughnut holes
are brick's favorite.

14:33.593 --> 14:35.027
I like waffles.

14:35.062 --> 14:37.997
Really?

14:41.435 --> 14:43.536
I like doughnut holes.

14:46.907 --> 14:49.341
Remember, don't start spelling
the word unless you know it.

14:49.376 --> 14:51.977
I wonder why I'm number 11.
And...and ask for the definition,

14:52.012 --> 14:54.913
Even if you know the word.
Hey, look! When I look down,

14:54.947 --> 14:58.516
My number looks the same to me as it
does to you. Brick, forget about the sign.

14:58.551 --> 15:01.619
You should be focusing on
letters right now, not numbers.

15:01.653 --> 15:03.688
Now over there,
that's your main competition...

15:03.722 --> 15:06.123
Sanjit bawa.
Hey!

15:06.158 --> 15:08.159
Brick,
don't befriend your enemy!

15:08.193 --> 15:10.227
He's nothing to you.
You're gonna take him down,

15:10.261 --> 15:13.430
Got it? Okay. When are we heading home?

15:13.465 --> 15:16.467
Can we eat at der
pancake haus on the way?

15:16.501 --> 15:18.736
Sue said that
they make the pancakes

15:18.770 --> 15:21.372
Right at your table.
Brick...

15:21.406 --> 15:23.340
Your ma said something
last night.

15:23.374 --> 15:26.109
Do you even care
about winning this thing?

15:26.144 --> 15:29.413
I don't know.
'cause, you know, you win,

15:29.447 --> 15:32.382
You get a trophy
to put on your shelf.

15:32.417 --> 15:35.953
I thought you'd think that was really cool.
Nah, I don't really care about the winning part.

15:35.987 --> 15:37.787
I just like to spell.

15:37.822 --> 15:40.790
<i>And that's when
it finally sunk in for mike.</i>

15:40.824 --> 15:43.525
<i>Brick really didn't care,</i>

15:43.560 --> 15:45.494
<i>And that chang everything.</i>

15:45.528 --> 15:48.197
That's your edge! That's how
you're gonna win this thing...

15:48.231 --> 15:49.798
By not caring.

15:49.832 --> 15:52.200
You're the ice man!
You're my brick of ice!

15:52.234 --> 15:53.968
<i>You see, unlike brick,</i>

15:54.002 --> 15:57.004
<i>Mike really does like
the winning part.</i>

15:57.038 --> 15:58.939
If we can, please have

15:58.973 --> 16:02.308
All the contestants
take their places?

16:03.510 --> 16:06.078
How is he?
He doesn't care at all.

16:06.213 --> 16:08.948
I think we got a real shot.

16:08.982 --> 16:10.549
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:10.584 --> 16:12.551
Welcome to the 45th annual
midwest regionals.

16:12.586 --> 16:16.055
The winner of this competition
will go on to compete

16:16.089 --> 16:17.857
In the scripps national
spelling bee

16:17.891 --> 16:20.994
In washington, D.C.
Let the spelling begin!

16:26.667 --> 16:29.670
"Grammar."
G-r-a-m-m-a-r.

16:29.704 --> 16:30.771
"Grammar."

16:30.805 --> 16:32.773
That is correct.

16:38.447 --> 16:39.848
"Privilege."

16:39.882 --> 16:43.985
P-r-i-v-e-l-e-g-e.

16:44.020 --> 16:47.589
I'm sorry. That's incorrect.

16:49.959 --> 16:52.828
"Sebaceous."
S-e-b-a...

16:52.862 --> 16:55.430
"Minutia."
M-i-n-u-t-i...

16:55.465 --> 16:58.968
"Saboteur."
S... a-b...

16:59.002 --> 17:01.704
O-u-s.
That is correct.

17:04.507 --> 17:06.642
"Ecclesiastic."
That is correct.

17:09.878 --> 17:13.248
That's incorrect.

17:13.281 --> 17:15.317
"Ubiquitous."
that is correct.

17:23.593 --> 17:27.628
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're down to the final two!

17:27.664 --> 17:31.500
One of these contestants
will be our midwest champion.

17:31.534 --> 17:34.636
Oh, my God! I can't look.
I'm too nervous.

17:34.670 --> 17:37.939
Come on, brick.
Come on. You can do th.

17:37.973 --> 17:40.174
The word is "prospicience."

17:40.208 --> 17:42.142
"prospicience."

17:42.177 --> 17:44.812
Can you give me
the definition, please?

17:44.846 --> 17:48.014
It means foresight,
seeing ahead.

17:48.049 --> 17:49.983
"Prospicience."

17:50.017 --> 17:54.554
P-r-o-s-p-i-c-i-e-n-c-e.

17:54.589 --> 17:56.089
"Prospicience."

17:56.123 --> 17:58.858
That is correct.

17:58.893 --> 18:01.294
The word is "guerdon."

18:01.328 --> 18:03.896
"guerdon."
what is the origin?

18:03.931 --> 18:06.165
Stall tactic.

18:06.199 --> 18:07.667
Middle english,
from old french.

18:07.701 --> 18:09.235
"guerdon."

18:09.269 --> 18:11.971
G-u...

18:13.740 --> 18:16.042
E-r...

18:16.076 --> 18:18.644
D-o-n.

18:18.679 --> 18:19.979
"guerdon."

18:20.013 --> 18:24.082
That is correct.

18:24.117 --> 18:28.619
The next word is
"chiaroscurist."

18:28.653 --> 18:31.254
Oh, my God!

18:31.289 --> 18:33.256
No, he knows this one.
What?

18:33.291 --> 18:36.492
He studied this one.
He knows it.

18:36.526 --> 18:39.461
Yeah. He knows it.
He knows it!

18:39.496 --> 18:41.830
<i>In that moment,
it all melted away...</i>

18:41.864 --> 18:44.065
<i>All the stress
and the sore backs</i>

18:44.100 --> 18:46.334
<i>And the complaining
and the fighting.</i>

18:46.369 --> 18:49.471
<i>We were there for one reason
and one reason alone...</i>

18:49.506 --> 18:52.507
<i>To cheer our littlest member
to his hard-won victory...</i>

18:52.542 --> 18:54.243
<i>Our victory.</i>

18:54.277 --> 18:56.211
"Chiaroscurist."

18:56.246 --> 19:02.117
C-h-i-a-r-o-s-c-u-r-i-s-t.

19:02.151 --> 19:03.552
"T."

19:05.521 --> 19:09.123
Oh, I'm sorry!
There's only one "t."

19:10.959 --> 19:14.561
No, no, no. He knows there's only
one "t." you don't understand...

19:27.607 --> 19:31.644
So, brick, I guess you cared
about the trophy after all.

19:31.678 --> 19:34.412
Guess you're a little more like
your old man than you thought.

19:34.447 --> 19:36.915
I wasn't mad about
not getting the trophy.

19:36.949 --> 19:39.517
I just wanted too
to washington, d.C.

19:39.552 --> 19:41.420
This trip has been so much fun,

19:41.454 --> 19:43.855
And I really wanted
to go on another one.

19:43.890 --> 19:46.592
<i>You thought the trip was fun?
This trip?</i>

19:46.627 --> 19:49.328
Oh, yeah.
Sue makes the best decisions.

19:49.362 --> 19:52.765
Where are we going on the
way home? Uh, I don't know.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.735
I think I'm done deciding.
It's too much pressure.

19:55.769 --> 19:59.539
Oh, come on, sue. It's
your birthday really?

19:59.574 --> 20:01.475
Okay. Well, there's this place

20:01.509 --> 20:03.610
That has the world's biggest
ball of paint,

20:03.644 --> 20:05.578
And then a little further
down the road

20:05.613 --> 20:08.114
Is this chinese restaurant
shaped like a biscuit! Awesome!

20:08.149 --> 20:10.783
World's biggest ball
of paint, here we come.

20:24.563 --> 20:27.832
<i>I can't say we fell
back in love with our car</i>

20:27.866 --> 20:29.800
<i>After that trip,
but brick was right...</i>

20:29.835 --> 20:33.137
<i>It is all about the journey
and not the trophy,</i>

20:33.171 --> 20:35.072
<i>Which he didn't get,</i>

20:35.107 --> 20:37.208
<i>Or the postcards,
which sue didn't get.</i>

20:37.242 --> 20:39.910
<i>But what we did get were
some pretty funny memories</i>

20:39.944 --> 20:42.512
I keep thinking
about axl squished up

20:42.547 --> 20:45.315
In that ridiculous cot
all night.

20:45.349 --> 20:47.950
<i>After all, it's the bad trips
that you never forget.</i>

20:47.985 --> 20:50.419
That was
definitely pathetic,

20:50.454 --> 20:53.622
But not more pathetic than
the world's stupidest stump.

20:53.656 --> 20:54.689
Why did I think
that would be fun?
