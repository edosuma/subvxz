WEBVTT

00:00.508 --> 00:02.569
Previously on "Whiskey Cavalier"...

00:02.594 --> 00:04.046
Did you just shut off the power grid?

00:04.070 --> 00:06.558
Yes, ma'am. You want
to cause a traffic jam?

00:06.583 --> 00:07.949
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

00:07.951 --> 00:10.252
I'm just hoping, if I
hang around long enough,

00:10.277 --> 00:12.888
that someday, Will will
forgive me and let me back in.

00:19.862 --> 00:22.230
Here's the thing. You're
never gonna stop being scared.

00:22.232 --> 00:24.028
What makes a good agent is the ability

00:24.053 --> 00:26.334
to push through that
fear and get the job done

00:26.336 --> 00:27.836
when everything's at stake.

00:27.838 --> 00:29.404
And I know you can do that.

00:32.976 --> 00:36.178
_

00:36.202 --> 00:38.651
_

00:43.753 --> 00:45.187
Too fast! Too fast!

00:45.189 --> 00:47.422
You keep saying the same
thing over and over again.

00:47.424 --> 00:48.590
Yeah, 'cause it's too fast!

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074

01:03.207 --> 01:05.407
Good morning. Whew! I'm still waking up.

01:06.030 --> 01:07.780
Hey, you know, I'd be,
uh, I'd be racing myself,

01:07.804 --> 01:09.177
but those rally cars, they're
really built for people

01:09.179 --> 01:10.378
under 5 feet tall.

01:10.380 --> 01:12.280
I'm 5'8". That's above average.

01:12.282 --> 01:13.415
You wish you were 5'8".

01:13.417 --> 01:15.016
Watch the road!

01:15.018 --> 01:16.184
Okay, guys, focus.

01:16.186 --> 01:18.344
Alexi Yogin, the
bio-terrorist you're grabbing,

01:18.369 --> 01:19.988
only leaves Moscow for these things.

01:19.990 --> 01:22.023
He's in the car right in front of you.

01:27.097 --> 01:28.296
Guys, I know we're on mission,

01:28.298 --> 01:30.098
but I think I can actually win this.

01:30.100 --> 01:32.467
- Permission to win?
- No. Sorry.

01:32.469 --> 01:34.569
It looks like Alexi's got a
security team at the finish line.

01:34.571 --> 01:36.294
You're gonna have to take
him out on the course.

01:36.318 --> 01:37.372
Ooh, fun.

01:37.374 --> 01:38.807
Do what now?!

01:43.347 --> 01:44.546
Whoo-hoo!

01:46.183 --> 01:48.083
Standish, you said you
wanted more field experience.

01:48.085 --> 01:49.117
Come on. Here it is.

01:49.119 --> 01:50.152
I take it back!

01:58.328 --> 02:00.061
Whooooo!

02:08.472 --> 02:10.672
All right, hold on.
Our friend's onto us.

02:10.674 --> 02:11.907
He's going off-road.

02:16.968 --> 02:18.301
Look, if I'm gonna die in this damn car,

02:18.303 --> 02:19.733
you better not lose his ass.

02:19.758 --> 02:20.814
Attaboy.

02:20.839 --> 02:22.239
- So proud!
- Right?

02:22.241 --> 02:23.256
Yeah.

02:25.910 --> 02:28.145
Here's your shot. Take it!

02:28.147 --> 02:30.914
- Ram him.
- All right. Yeah.

02:30.916 --> 02:32.683
Here we go. Come on.

02:32.685 --> 02:33.984
Here we go!

02:43.986 --> 02:45.019
Oh.

02:45.044 --> 02:46.063
Okay.

02:46.065 --> 02:47.864
Interesting choice.

02:54.006 --> 02:55.505
Alexi, let me see your hands!

02:55.507 --> 02:56.507
In the air!

03:00.812 --> 03:01.912
Standish, what are you doing?

03:01.914 --> 03:03.046
I think he's hurt.

03:03.048 --> 03:04.147
Please help.

03:04.149 --> 03:05.882
Do not approach the asset!

03:05.884 --> 03:07.250
- Standish...
- Standish...

03:07.252 --> 03:08.518
My leg's broken.

03:08.520 --> 03:09.753
Standish, no! Think!

03:09.755 --> 03:11.621
Relax! Obviously, he broke his leg.

03:17.924 --> 03:19.458
My bad.

03:47.226 --> 03:49.025
Look, if you wanna be mad
at someone, be mad at him.

03:49.027 --> 03:50.894
He's the one who shot the asset!

03:50.896 --> 03:53.063
Uh, yeah... to save your life.

03:53.065 --> 03:56.666
Look, Jai, I think we're all getting
a little tired of your excuses.

03:56.668 --> 03:58.301
I...

03:58.303 --> 04:00.270
Thank you for saving my life.

04:00.272 --> 04:01.705
My mom thanks you, too.

04:01.707 --> 04:03.774
All right. We got to go
get our mission from Ray.

04:03.776 --> 04:05.175
Looks like, uh, you're coming along.

04:05.177 --> 04:07.310
Oh, come on, man. Am I in trouble?

04:07.312 --> 04:09.312
I thought Alexi was hurt.
I just wanted to help.

04:09.337 --> 04:11.608
Hey, look, it's normal
to feel for another human

04:11.633 --> 04:12.672
when they're in pain.

04:12.696 --> 04:14.630
You'd have to be a sociopath not to.

04:15.686 --> 04:16.820
That's your cue.

04:16.822 --> 04:18.255
If I was there,

04:18.257 --> 04:19.616
after I shot Alexi,

04:19.641 --> 04:21.524
- I would have shot you!
- There it is.

04:21.527 --> 04:22.908
So you would've killed me for a mistake.

04:22.932 --> 04:25.695
No. I would have put one in
the leg to teach you a lesson!

04:25.697 --> 04:27.164
Mm-hmm.

04:31.169 --> 04:32.435
- Okay.
- Wow. Just the leg?

04:32.437 --> 04:33.737
You're showing a lot of personal growth.

04:33.739 --> 04:35.238
I'm proud of you, Frankie.

04:35.240 --> 04:36.907
I'm trying.

04:38.043 --> 04:39.876
Ray, is everything okay?

04:39.878 --> 04:42.245
Yeah. I'm great. Why?

04:42.247 --> 04:43.380
Oh.

04:43.382 --> 04:45.649
I'm, um... watching my
niece for the weekend,

04:45.651 --> 04:47.284
and she likes to play dress-up.

04:47.286 --> 04:49.619
Uncle Ray, can I put
lipstick on you later?

04:49.621 --> 04:50.987
Mm...

04:50.989 --> 04:52.889
I'm gonna answer this one. Yes.

04:52.891 --> 04:53.990
Yes!

04:55.193 --> 04:57.294
Joke's on you. I look great in lipstick.

04:57.296 --> 04:58.328
Do you?

04:59.463 --> 05:02.999
So, the... team's new
target is Kim Yong Son.

05:03.868 --> 05:07.838
He's an engineering prodigy at
Bucharest Technical Institute.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.841
He's spent years studying
maglev technology,

05:10.843 --> 05:13.043
which harnesses EMF propulsion fields.

05:13.045 --> 05:14.911
C-Can we have that in
English, please, Ray?

05:14.913 --> 05:16.379
They're using magnets to move stuff.

05:16.381 --> 05:17.914
Oh. Why didn't you just say that?

05:17.916 --> 05:19.610
Well, I would've if I understood it,

05:19.635 --> 05:21.251
but I didn't, so I couldn't.

05:21.253 --> 05:23.119
Anyway, Yong claims to be working on

05:23.121 --> 05:24.600
a new high-speed railway system.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.556
Yeah, I studied maglev
propulsion at MIT.

05:26.558 --> 05:28.692
That technology has
military applications.

05:28.694 --> 05:30.060
Bingo!

05:30.062 --> 05:31.895
His country's military
wants to use his research

05:31.897 --> 05:33.430
to build long-range missiles.

05:33.432 --> 05:35.165
We're not sure if Yong even knows.

05:35.167 --> 05:36.867
That puts every ally,
including the U.S.,

05:36.869 --> 05:38.101
within a dictator's striking distance.

05:38.103 --> 05:40.370
It reshapes the balance of power.

05:40.372 --> 05:42.372
See? That time, I explained it good.

05:42.374 --> 05:44.708
Okay, just one question...

05:44.710 --> 05:45.942
why am I here?

05:45.944 --> 05:47.739
Well, we need to retrieve Yong's data

05:47.764 --> 05:49.317
before it falls into the wrong hands.

05:49.342 --> 05:51.414
And convince him to defect.

05:51.416 --> 05:52.437
So...

05:52.462 --> 05:54.484
the team's going back to college!

05:54.486 --> 05:55.952
Hey.

05:55.954 --> 05:58.989
And you are going undercover
as Yong's new roommate,

05:58.991 --> 06:01.892
which means you, my
friend, are running point.

06:01.894 --> 06:04.194
What?! That's a horrible idea.

06:04.196 --> 06:06.897
Hey, let's... let's be supportive here.

06:06.899 --> 06:08.295
Ray, it's not a great idea.

06:08.740 --> 06:10.000
I can hear both of y'all.

06:10.002 --> 06:11.668
Like, I'm in the room with you.

06:11.670 --> 06:14.665
- We know.
- Wait. So... why me?

06:14.690 --> 06:16.740
Well, for one thing, you speak nerd.

06:16.899 --> 06:18.165
So you two can talk about

06:18.190 --> 06:20.720
maglev-propulsion... whatever, okay?

06:20.745 --> 06:23.045
And also, look, you're
the only guy on the team

06:23.070 --> 06:24.781
that can pass as a college student.

06:24.783 --> 06:26.016
Mm...

06:26.018 --> 06:27.550
I can still pass as a grad student.

06:31.890 --> 06:34.090
Is he serious?

06:35.427 --> 06:37.727
Okay. Is that it, Ray? Anything else?

06:37.729 --> 06:39.162
No. Whew!

06:39.164 --> 06:40.931
Uh, here's your covers.

06:40.933 --> 06:43.300
- That was good, Will.
- Good luck.

06:43.302 --> 06:45.035
Come on. I got a baby face. I can...

06:45.037 --> 06:47.003
That's rich.

06:51.642 --> 06:53.143
Let's make you a princess.

06:54.211 --> 06:55.278
Oh, boy.

06:56.881 --> 06:58.704
I've e-mailed you your course schedule.

06:58.729 --> 07:00.634
You're placed in most of Yong's classes.

07:00.659 --> 07:02.936
Will and I will also be
on campus, as professors.

07:02.961 --> 07:04.561
I love that we get
to go back to college.

07:04.695 --> 07:06.035
I mean, it was the
happiest times of my life.

07:06.037 --> 07:07.137
You guys think I'm cool now...

07:07.139 --> 07:08.171
No one thinks you're cool now.

07:08.173 --> 07:09.539
I think you're totally cool.

07:09.541 --> 07:10.640
Thank you, Standish.

07:11.809 --> 07:12.876
But I could be wrong.

07:12.878 --> 07:14.344
Better I play both sides.

07:14.346 --> 07:16.352
Getting ahold of Yong's
research is gonna be hard,

07:16.377 --> 07:18.539
but getting him to defect,
that's gonna be even harder.

07:18.564 --> 07:19.876
I mean, we don't know
where his allegiance lies.

07:19.900 --> 07:21.117
We don't even know if he's interested.

07:21.119 --> 07:22.585
You need to get close to Yong fast.

07:22.587 --> 07:24.654
You two have a lot in common.

07:24.656 --> 07:26.055
You're both giant nerds.

07:26.057 --> 07:28.491
Get him to trust you, ask
him about his personal life...

07:28.493 --> 07:31.294
No offense, Frankie, but are you
telling me how to make a friend?

07:31.296 --> 07:33.930
Oh, he's, uh, he's implying
that you've never made a friend.

07:33.932 --> 07:35.999
Uh, I made a friend just recently.

07:36.001 --> 07:37.371
Name him.

07:37.396 --> 07:38.434
Keith.

07:38.436 --> 07:39.769
Keith who?

07:39.771 --> 07:41.138
Richards.

07:41.163 --> 07:42.672
No, that's the lead guitarist
for The Rolling Stones.

07:42.674 --> 07:44.674
Okay. I'm gonna go pack.

07:44.676 --> 07:46.091
Hey, before you go, uh,

07:46.116 --> 07:48.664
there's something that's not
in the dossier that should be.

07:49.146 --> 07:50.547
It's how much I believe in you.

07:50.549 --> 07:51.581
Oh, God.

07:52.750 --> 07:54.551
Come on. Bring it in.

07:55.754 --> 07:57.053
I really do think you're cool.

07:57.055 --> 07:58.922
I know. Everybody does.

07:58.924 --> 08:00.490
You go get 'em, huh?

08:01.457 --> 08:03.096
What is with this touchy-feely crap?

08:03.121 --> 08:04.447
You're gonna make him soft!

08:04.472 --> 08:06.297
I'm just trying to boost
his self-esteem, okay?

08:06.321 --> 08:07.953
I've trained a bunch of newbie agents.

08:07.978 --> 08:09.712
All they need to know is
there's a support system there.

08:09.736 --> 08:11.067
No, they don't.

08:11.069 --> 08:12.435
They need tough love.

08:12.437 --> 08:14.360
They need to know that
if they make a mistake,

08:14.385 --> 08:16.718
millions of people will die
and it's all their fault.

08:17.794 --> 08:19.005
You should work with children.

08:19.030 --> 08:20.262
Really?

08:20.287 --> 08:21.687
No.

08:23.441 --> 08:24.608
Okay.

08:24.633 --> 08:26.967
At college, I will be...

08:27.063 --> 08:28.695
- "Dr. Vijay Parikh."
- Ooh.

08:28.720 --> 08:32.188
"Visiting fellow from Berkeley,
researching astrophysics."

08:32.190 --> 08:33.756
- Ooh!
- Oh, I like mine.

08:33.758 --> 08:36.453
"Carmen Veracruz, sexy psych professor."

08:36.479 --> 08:38.868
What, it says "sexy" on the page?

08:38.893 --> 08:40.235
No. I added that.

08:40.260 --> 08:41.703
But it's accurate.

08:41.799 --> 08:44.033
No argument here. We are...

08:44.034 --> 08:46.990
We have these a-and books for
our course, s-so we're set.

08:47.015 --> 08:48.622
Ah! Reading for the plane!

08:48.647 --> 08:49.693
Daah! No!

08:49.718 --> 08:52.235
I'm sorry. Just...
Don't open that, please.

08:52.260 --> 08:53.618
Jai, it's a book.

08:53.643 --> 08:56.579
Yes, but inside the book are
really sensitive micro cameras

08:56.581 --> 08:57.791
for on-site surveillance.

08:57.816 --> 09:00.205
So if we put these in
all of Yong's classes,

09:00.230 --> 09:01.814
we can watch him around the clock.

09:01.839 --> 09:03.186
That is so cool!

09:03.188 --> 09:04.631
- I did that.
- Nice!

09:04.656 --> 09:06.822
- Hey, party people!
- Hi, Ray.

09:06.847 --> 09:09.035
We just got some new intel on Yong.

09:09.060 --> 09:11.638
Turns out his country
sent a handler along

09:11.663 --> 09:12.995
to watch his every move.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.965
You guys need to figure out
who that is and take him down.

09:15.967 --> 09:17.200
Understood. Thanks, Ray.

09:17.202 --> 09:18.334
All right.

09:22.607 --> 09:23.940
Okay, you're not leaving.

09:23.942 --> 09:26.175
Feels like you guys need
an extra body, you know?

09:26.177 --> 09:29.712
Someone with field experience,
someone who knows the team,

09:29.714 --> 09:32.448
someone who doesn't want to
babysit his niece anymore.

09:32.450 --> 09:34.484
Are you serious, Ray?

09:34.486 --> 09:35.785
Look at my nails.

09:36.755 --> 09:39.355
No. N-No, no... That's not...

09:41.126 --> 09:44.193
Look, she wants to pluck
my brows next, all right?

09:44.195 --> 09:45.513
I don't care if I get shot.

09:45.538 --> 09:47.604
Just please, take me with you.

09:48.232 --> 09:51.334
Do you really think you could
pass for a college professor?

09:51.336 --> 09:53.002
Not a chance in hell. Hmm.

09:53.004 --> 09:55.571
Uh... but I could be a football coach.

09:55.573 --> 09:59.442
_

10:07.579 --> 10:08.953
Thanks so much.

10:10.009 --> 10:11.242
Ah, sweet!

10:11.267 --> 10:14.935
I wanted a group photo of us on campus.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.392
Oh, college.

10:16.394 --> 10:17.727
Take it in, you guys.

10:17.729 --> 10:19.996
Full of knowledge and ambition.

10:19.998 --> 10:21.685
Sports and beer.

10:21.710 --> 10:22.965
Walks of shame.

10:22.967 --> 10:24.901
Okay, enough Memory Lane, everybody.

10:24.903 --> 10:26.969
Yong's research puts millions in danger.

10:26.971 --> 10:28.535
- We have to move fast.
- Relax.

10:28.560 --> 10:30.573
I'm gonna have Yong and his research

10:30.575 --> 10:32.709
wrapped up in a bow like that.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.511
Hey.

10:46.536 --> 10:48.469
I'm Reggie. How you doing?

10:48.494 --> 10:50.794
I'm-a tell you how you're
doing. You're doing great.

10:50.875 --> 10:52.441
Because Reggie is now your roommate.

10:52.466 --> 10:53.763
Reggie the Roommate, coming through.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.170
We need to come up
with a cool handshake.

10:55.194 --> 10:57.637
- How you feel about that?
- Can you hand me those headphones?

10:57.662 --> 10:59.362
Yeah. Yeah.

11:01.560 --> 11:02.594
Here you go.

11:06.903 --> 11:08.790
You know I can see those
aren't plugged in, right?

11:08.814 --> 11:09.847
Yes, I know.

11:09.872 --> 11:11.338
Okay. All right.

11:14.449 --> 11:15.729
Look, it's okay, Standish.

11:15.754 --> 11:17.197
It was a bit of a rocky start,

11:17.222 --> 11:19.232
but everything is gonna be just fine.

11:19.257 --> 11:22.058
Now, remember that Yong is
from an oppressed country,

11:22.060 --> 11:23.993
so he... you know, he'd
probably love a roommate

11:23.995 --> 11:26.263
who can show him how to
have a little bit of fun.

11:27.065 --> 11:28.998
Come on, you've got this, man.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.067
I got this.

11:31.069 --> 11:34.170
Hey, man! We're gonna have
a great semester together.

11:34.172 --> 11:36.573
Uh-oh. Watch out. Incoming.

11:36.575 --> 11:38.575
Excuse me, we're looking for the class

11:38.577 --> 11:40.710
with beautiful women and amazing smiles.

11:40.712 --> 11:43.127
You two obviously know
where that is, right?

11:44.310 --> 11:45.893
Hey, you want to, like,
meet up with them later?

11:45.917 --> 11:47.317
Go to a bar or something?

11:47.319 --> 11:49.562
Do other people find you funny?

11:49.587 --> 11:50.620
I'd like to think so.

11:50.645 --> 11:51.910
They're wrong.

11:53.724 --> 11:55.024
All right.

11:55.026 --> 11:57.532
Good morning. How's everyone feeling?

11:57.557 --> 11:59.357
A little anxious?

11:59.382 --> 12:00.848
Well, don't be.

12:00.873 --> 12:04.675
Welcome to Abnormal Psychology.

12:05.924 --> 12:07.290
Okay!

12:07.315 --> 12:10.286
I'm gonna start by
learning everyone's name.

12:10.311 --> 12:11.744
Good morning!

12:11.769 --> 12:13.902
My name is Dr. Parikh.

12:13.945 --> 12:15.879
Your names are not important.

12:15.881 --> 12:17.814
This is the research lab component

12:17.816 --> 12:19.182
of your respective majors.

12:19.184 --> 12:22.619
I expect you to be
diligent, focused, perfect.

12:23.305 --> 12:24.806
I don't take questions.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.063
Let's begin.

12:37.902 --> 12:39.669
Sick laptop you got there, man.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.752
You know, if you want to
maximize your performance,

12:41.776 --> 12:44.140
discrete graphics chips beat
integrated GPUs every time.

12:45.742 --> 12:47.038
You play "Fortnite"? I've been...

12:47.062 --> 12:49.608
Video games are the reason
people are getting dumber.

12:50.982 --> 12:52.449
I saw you playing in our room.

12:52.451 --> 12:54.017
Now you're just being mean.

12:54.019 --> 12:55.351
He's just being mean, right?

12:56.520 --> 12:58.388
Not gonna offer me
none? Okay. It's cool.

12:58.390 --> 12:59.511
Good morning, everybody!

12:59.535 --> 13:01.357
Good morning! Hello!

13:01.359 --> 13:03.259
Hello. My name is, uh, Professor Hewson.

13:03.261 --> 13:04.727
This is Professor Brenner.

13:04.729 --> 13:06.129
We will be co-lecturing

13:06.131 --> 13:09.732
on Gender Roles and Sexuality
in Classic Literature.

13:09.734 --> 13:11.367
So, where to start?

13:11.369 --> 13:13.570
With female characters, you're
either a damsel in distress

13:13.572 --> 13:14.804
or you get killed.

13:14.806 --> 13:16.272
Lecture over. Thanks, everybody.

13:16.274 --> 13:18.533
Okay, Amy, I don't think that's... fair.

13:18.558 --> 13:19.843
I mean, classic literature

13:19.845 --> 13:21.978
is full of modernized
takes on sexuality.

13:21.980 --> 13:23.313
I'm kind of an expert.

13:23.315 --> 13:26.516
Yeah, well, those who can't do... teach.

13:27.552 --> 13:28.852
Okay, I-I think...

13:28.854 --> 13:30.987
She's the fun one in the group. Y...

13:30.989 --> 13:33.690
I can do. Trust me, I
can... I can do and do.

13:33.692 --> 13:34.808
I mean, I-I...

13:34.833 --> 13:36.960
I'm not gonna do right here
in front of the class...

13:36.962 --> 13:38.798
- Thank God.
- But...

13:38.823 --> 13:40.730
Look, uh, take Charlotte Bronte's, uh,

13:40.732 --> 13:41.865
"Jane Eyre," All right?

13:41.867 --> 13:44.000
In a time of sexual repression,

13:44.002 --> 13:45.635
she gave us a female protagonist

13:45.637 --> 13:48.471
who doggedly pursued her
innermost carnal desires.

13:48.473 --> 13:49.606
I mean, that's...

13:51.675 --> 13:52.909
That, I like.

13:53.711 --> 13:54.911
I thought you would.

13:54.913 --> 13:56.446
Just kiss her already!

13:56.448 --> 13:58.848
- Okay.
- Oooh! Oooh! Oooh! Oooh!

13:58.850 --> 14:00.083
Thank you. all right, everybody.

14:00.085 --> 14:01.723
- Guys, take out your syllabuses, please.
- The tension's in the air.

14:01.747 --> 14:02.952
You can't feel that?

14:02.954 --> 14:04.287
The first bullet point
is... is "Ulysses" by Joyce.

14:04.289 --> 14:05.922
I don't know what I'm doing.

14:05.924 --> 14:07.524
Good first lecture.

14:07.526 --> 14:08.993
Well, I'm glad to say that in this hour,

14:09.017 --> 14:10.582
we determined that, "A," we can all read

14:10.606 --> 14:12.254
and, "B," that we are
all sexual creatures.

14:12.278 --> 14:13.796
Now, go home. I'll see you on Wednesday.

14:13.798 --> 14:15.798
And focus on one of those two.

14:15.800 --> 14:17.100
Goodbye, everybody.

14:22.809 --> 14:23.840
Hey.

14:23.842 --> 14:25.241
I just wanted you to know

14:25.243 --> 14:27.710
I really, really enjoyed your lecture.

14:27.712 --> 14:31.347
Oh, thank you. I-I really,
really appreciate that.

14:31.349 --> 14:32.482
Good.

14:32.484 --> 14:34.518
Uh, would you like to
meet Professor Brenner?

14:34.543 --> 14:35.585
Hi.

14:35.587 --> 14:36.886
Nah. I'm good.

14:36.888 --> 14:37.888
Bye.

14:38.522 --> 14:40.523
And that's why I hated college.

14:40.525 --> 14:42.358
All right, Yong, I'll check you later.

14:42.360 --> 14:43.927
Hope not.

14:47.332 --> 14:48.831
Thank you.

14:48.833 --> 14:50.967
- How's it going up there?
- Not great.

14:50.969 --> 14:52.053
I know.

14:52.078 --> 14:53.469
We all know.

14:53.471 --> 14:54.837
I got to ask you...

14:54.839 --> 14:57.040
what if I can't connect with Yong?

14:57.042 --> 14:58.441
What if I can't get him to defect?

14:58.443 --> 15:00.910
Don't worry. We'll just
switch to another tactic.

15:00.912 --> 15:02.768
We'll still need to obtain his research,

15:02.793 --> 15:04.456
and since Yong can
just re-create it all,

15:04.481 --> 15:06.395
he'll either be abducted
or we'll take him out.

15:06.420 --> 15:07.450
Take him out?

15:07.452 --> 15:09.185
W-What are you doing?

15:09.187 --> 15:10.987
Your teddy bear tactics aren't working.

15:10.989 --> 15:12.021
Tough love time.

15:12.023 --> 15:13.456
Look, we can't kill him.

15:13.458 --> 15:15.858
He's a jerk, yeah, but he's just a kid.

15:15.860 --> 15:16.935
Tell me we're not gonna kill him.

15:16.959 --> 15:17.981
Look at me.

15:18.006 --> 15:20.763
Nobody on our team
is going to kill Yong.

15:20.765 --> 15:22.065
Thank God.

15:22.067 --> 15:23.366
Wait, what about another team?

15:23.368 --> 15:24.867
- Nnh.
- You want the truth?

15:24.869 --> 15:26.655
That kid's creating a lethal weapon,

15:26.680 --> 15:28.280
so you need to connect with him ASAP.

15:28.305 --> 15:31.474
Eliminate that threat by
getting him to switch sides...

15:31.476 --> 15:32.976
or he's probably going to die.

15:32.978 --> 15:34.146
Get it?

15:34.171 --> 15:35.243
Yeah.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.567
Get to work.

15:37.247 --> 15:38.615
All right, I got this.

15:39.984 --> 15:42.352
Now he has a fire under him.

15:42.354 --> 15:43.760
That's how you train an agent.

15:43.785 --> 15:44.885
Yeah. Great job.

15:44.910 --> 15:46.733
You know, he's, um... he's on comms.

15:46.758 --> 15:49.130
I can hear him throwing
up in the hallway.

15:49.155 --> 15:50.302
Well...

15:51.271 --> 15:54.005
"Well"? Scare the puke out of the kid.

16:05.944 --> 16:07.010
Nice, Tomas!

16:07.012 --> 16:08.544
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

16:08.546 --> 16:10.513
I got to tell you, when I volunteered

16:10.515 --> 16:12.488
to be the club rugby coach, I, uh...

16:12.513 --> 16:14.050
I didn't know a thing about the game.

16:14.052 --> 16:16.452
Now, I'm a little fuzzy
on the rules still,

16:16.454 --> 16:18.755
so, uh, today, we're gonna
start with the basics,

16:18.757 --> 16:21.057
and that's posing for the team picture.

16:21.059 --> 16:24.227
This is how we did it in
football, so listen up.

16:24.229 --> 16:26.629
Need a wide stance.

16:26.631 --> 16:28.998
Hands behind your back.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.934
Thick neck... that's the key.
Thick as you can make it.

16:31.936 --> 16:33.076
Dead in the eyes.

16:33.101 --> 16:34.515
If you're wondering what's
going through my mind,

16:34.539 --> 16:37.607
it's absolutely nothing... just
a bunch of clicks and buzzes.

16:37.609 --> 16:39.054
Now, let's go! Come on, now!

16:39.079 --> 16:40.843
Think "Thick neck"! Thick neck!

16:40.845 --> 16:42.879
Everybody! Thick as you can make it!

16:42.881 --> 16:45.815
Ooh, easy. Easy, there,
son. Just a thick neck.

16:45.817 --> 16:48.017
You look like you're
gonna squirt your shorts.

16:48.019 --> 16:49.628
You know, there's a lot
of big guys out here.

16:49.652 --> 16:52.052
You'd better be fast, or
you're gonna get killed.

16:52.123 --> 16:55.258
When my government allowed
me to come here to study,

16:55.260 --> 16:57.655
they required me to
get physical activity

16:57.680 --> 16:59.547
at least once a week.

16:59.572 --> 17:01.439
Fun government.

17:03.333 --> 17:05.490
Oh, looks like your big
friend's checking on you.

17:06.439 --> 17:07.938
Uh...

17:07.963 --> 17:10.096
I don't know him.

17:10.340 --> 17:12.675
Oh, well, let's work
on your picture neck.

17:13.625 --> 17:15.025
Yeah. Yeah, thick.

17:15.050 --> 17:16.782
Looks good. Looks good. Thicker.

17:19.367 --> 17:20.667
Well, whoever the handler is,

17:20.692 --> 17:22.692
he'll be around Yong all the time.

17:22.820 --> 17:25.021
I got a list from the
registrar of all the students

17:25.022 --> 17:26.748
who share more than one class with Yong.

17:26.772 --> 17:27.815
I've been going through all the footage

17:27.839 --> 17:29.068
I got from my textbook cams.

17:29.093 --> 17:31.461
All we got to do is
crosscheck it against the names

17:31.463 --> 17:33.563
and see if anyone's
behaving suspiciously.

17:33.565 --> 17:36.132
I have been watching
this for a long time.

17:36.134 --> 17:39.695
I'm reminded of the fact that
college was really boring.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.450
- Are you kidding?
- Mnh-mnh.

17:42.475 --> 17:45.143
College is filled with drama.

17:45.168 --> 17:46.534
Yeah, look.

17:46.559 --> 17:48.289
The one getting extra
help from her professor?

17:49.495 --> 17:52.081
That is more than "extra help."

17:52.083 --> 17:53.483
Look at her.

17:53.485 --> 17:55.485
She's batting her eyelashes.

17:55.487 --> 17:57.453
She's just laughing so much.

17:57.455 --> 17:59.822
No chemistry professor is that charming.

18:01.492 --> 18:03.392
- That is a lot of touching.
- Mm-hmm.

18:04.854 --> 18:06.755
Are they sleeping together?

18:06.780 --> 18:07.879
Oh, yeah.

18:07.904 --> 18:09.804
And look at his hand.

18:09.829 --> 18:10.867
That is a wedding ring.

18:10.869 --> 18:12.001
- Uh-huh.
- He is married!

18:12.003 --> 18:13.336
This is a bad man.

18:13.338 --> 18:14.704
A ba... Ooh, a bad man.

18:14.706 --> 18:16.439
Anyway, enough of her.

18:16.441 --> 18:17.874
- Oh, no!
- Yes, yes!

18:17.876 --> 18:19.721
This is the student
that I'm interested in...

18:19.746 --> 18:20.810
Park Lin.

18:20.812 --> 18:22.278
Ooh, yeah, I just met that guy.

18:22.280 --> 18:25.548
He seemed very aware of Yong.

18:25.550 --> 18:27.183
What are you wearing?

18:27.185 --> 18:28.885
Oh, this is my new rugby jersey.

18:28.887 --> 18:30.086
I love this sport.

18:30.088 --> 18:32.155
Tomas says I'm a natural hooker.

18:33.257 --> 18:34.991
That's a... rugby position.

18:34.993 --> 18:37.660
Unless he's playing a
very mean trick on me.

18:39.396 --> 18:41.330
All right, hang on.

18:41.332 --> 18:44.167
Park Lin... 3.0 GPA, born in Seoul,

18:44.169 --> 18:45.968
very little social media...

18:45.970 --> 18:47.143
Wait.

18:47.168 --> 18:49.735
He joined college late
'cause he's former military.

18:49.760 --> 18:50.926
Fits the profile.

18:50.951 --> 18:52.909
- Let's keep an eye on him.
- Mm-hmm.

18:52.934 --> 18:55.208
Now, as the world's youngest recipient of the...

18:55.232 --> 18:58.182
no talking... Wrexham Williams
Prize for physics innovation,

18:58.207 --> 19:02.018
I am uniquely qualified to judge
what is in the nascent brain.

19:02.020 --> 19:03.920
In yours, nothing.

19:04.906 --> 19:06.106
Carry on.

19:06.131 --> 19:07.571
Now, some of you might be wondering,

19:07.759 --> 19:09.458
"If we leave our lab stations messy,

19:09.460 --> 19:11.294
does he just come in in
the middle of the night

19:11.296 --> 19:13.296
and throw all of our stuff away?"

19:13.298 --> 19:14.730
I do!

19:14.732 --> 19:16.165
And I'm not sorry.

19:16.167 --> 19:18.334
In fact, if it's expensive...

19:18.336 --> 19:19.635
I'll keep it.

19:25.609 --> 19:27.076
Hey.

19:27.078 --> 19:28.544
Look at this kid.

19:28.546 --> 19:30.746
Still testing Gaussian lasers,
like we're in high school.

19:33.550 --> 19:34.851
What are you working on?

19:34.853 --> 19:36.960
Oh, what is that... maglev technology?

19:36.985 --> 19:38.233
I've dabbled.

19:38.258 --> 19:39.922
Worked with superconducting
electromagnets

19:39.924 --> 19:43.025
to minimize friction and
make transport more efficient.

19:43.027 --> 19:44.488
Need some help?

19:44.513 --> 19:47.104
I'd appreciate it if you
didn't bother yourself

19:47.129 --> 19:48.831
with my work.

19:54.173 --> 19:55.289
Okay.

19:55.314 --> 19:59.442
Yong has left the building,
and Standish is still whiffing.

19:59.444 --> 20:01.611
Standish, are you trying
to get your roommate killed?

20:01.613 --> 20:03.212
No. I'm trying to bond with him

20:03.214 --> 20:04.614
over science, like you said.

20:04.616 --> 20:06.482
I've also tried fun, humor,

20:06.484 --> 20:07.950
and just all-around being awesome,

20:07.952 --> 20:10.019
but none of them is working,
so get off my back, Frankie.

20:10.021 --> 20:11.220
I'm not on your back.

20:11.222 --> 20:12.963
She's definitely on your back.

20:12.988 --> 20:14.388
It's, uh, it's too much.

20:14.459 --> 20:15.977
Oh, good. Will's here.

20:16.002 --> 20:17.360
You know why I'm so stressed?

20:17.362 --> 20:19.124
Because you put his
life on my shoulders,

20:19.149 --> 20:20.763
and that's just too much
pressure for any human being.

20:20.765 --> 20:22.437
It's like my head's in a vise,

20:22.462 --> 20:24.166
and you just keep
turning it and turning it

20:24.168 --> 20:25.701
- and turning it and turning it...
- Standish!

20:25.703 --> 20:26.841
- ... and turning it...
- Standish.

20:26.865 --> 20:28.567
... and turning it and turning it
till you can't turn it no more.

20:28.591 --> 20:30.339
But then you turn it one
more time, just to crack it.

20:30.363 --> 20:31.864
- Yeah.
- And you want to see if you can crack me.

20:31.888 --> 20:34.188
Well, you're not gonna crack
me, Frankie. You're not doing it.

20:36.243 --> 20:38.210
Hey, I know I got here late, but, uh,

20:38.235 --> 20:40.102
how's that tough love working out?

20:40.851 --> 20:42.351
Look, I know you don't
like to admit this,

20:42.353 --> 20:44.987
but you and I both care
about Standish, right?

20:45.889 --> 20:49.725
Yeah. So, then, let's
work together and help him.

20:50.794 --> 20:51.827
Fine.

20:52.737 --> 20:53.796
Fine.

20:57.934 --> 20:59.206
Hey, yo, Yong!

21:00.271 --> 21:02.004
Yong! Man, we got to talk.

21:02.006 --> 21:04.965
Of course. 'Cause I'm the
only one you ever talk to.

21:04.990 --> 21:07.207
No. I just finished having
an hour-long conversation

21:07.232 --> 21:09.312
with the dorm RA about
how you want a new roommate

21:09.314 --> 21:10.880
because I make you uncomfortable.

21:10.882 --> 21:12.281
I was just being honest.

21:12.283 --> 21:13.883
You told him I was selling heroin.

21:13.885 --> 21:15.832
I said I didn't know for sure.

21:15.857 --> 21:17.453
You know what? I'm done with
you! I'm done with all of this!

21:17.455 --> 21:20.957
If you had any idea why I was
trying so hard, you would...

21:22.483 --> 21:25.761
You and your pretentious attitude can...

21:32.347 --> 21:33.479
- Run.
- What?

21:34.839 --> 21:35.962
Run!

21:44.215 --> 21:46.048
Whoa! Whoa!

21:50.588 --> 21:52.088
Take this! Go over there!

22:12.110 --> 22:13.275
Let's go.

22:13.277 --> 22:14.803
What the hell's happening?!

22:14.828 --> 22:16.161
More running, less talking!

22:19.851 --> 22:21.123
Who the hell were they?!

22:21.148 --> 22:22.460
All right. You should be safe here.

22:22.484 --> 22:23.682
I got people watching the building.

22:23.684 --> 22:24.983
What are you talking about?!

22:24.985 --> 22:26.615
W-Why did someone try to kill us?!

22:26.640 --> 22:28.554
- W-What's going on?!
- Hey!

22:28.556 --> 22:29.822
Look, I lied, okay.

22:29.824 --> 22:31.464
I'm not just the best
college roommate ever.

22:31.488 --> 22:32.891
I'm also an undercover agent.

22:32.893 --> 22:35.057
- Wha...
- I'll be back to explain more later,

22:35.082 --> 22:36.386
but I got to go check in
with my team, all right?

22:36.410 --> 22:38.403
- Just lock the door behind me.
- Oh, wait, wait!

22:39.904 --> 22:42.155
A-A-About before...

22:42.180 --> 22:44.748
sorry if I was being a little abrasive.

22:44.773 --> 22:45.872
A little?

22:45.897 --> 22:47.463
Yes.

22:47.488 --> 22:50.656
My whole life, people have
always wanted something from me.

22:50.681 --> 22:53.949
I-I just thought you were the same.

22:53.974 --> 22:55.240
Anyway...

22:56.339 --> 22:58.039
... thank you for saving my life.

23:00.501 --> 23:01.700
It's what I do.

23:04.943 --> 23:06.443
It's Reggie time.

23:10.095 --> 23:11.510
Oh! There you guys are!

23:11.512 --> 23:12.845
Listen, it just got crazy!

23:12.847 --> 23:14.413
I got attacked by two assassins and...

23:15.348 --> 23:18.250
They were dressed
ex... actly like y'all.

23:18.252 --> 23:20.319
Nice job knocking me off my bike.

23:20.321 --> 23:21.453
Totally hurt my knee.

23:21.455 --> 23:23.322
Oh. Good. I'm glad you got hurt.

23:23.324 --> 23:25.224
Because I thought I was going to die!

23:25.226 --> 23:26.379
Why did you attack me?

23:26.404 --> 23:27.981
It's an old spy trick...
you get the asset

23:28.005 --> 23:29.628
to feel indebted to you
because you "saved their life."

23:29.630 --> 23:30.872
It's a quick way to bond.

23:30.897 --> 23:31.959
- Oh, it's a quick way to bond.
- Good. Yeah.

23:31.983 --> 23:33.052
Well, that's insane!

23:33.077 --> 23:34.276
Did it work?

23:34.301 --> 23:35.505
That's not the point.

23:35.530 --> 23:37.636
The point is, you guys need to
let me know what the plan is.

23:37.638 --> 23:39.377
- Why didn't you?
- Needed to seem real.

23:39.402 --> 23:40.828
- Mm-hmm.
- You're not a great actor.

23:40.852 --> 23:42.642
- Mm.
- That's hurtful.

23:43.247 --> 23:44.546
You guys made such a big scene.

23:44.571 --> 23:45.990
What if we tipped off Yong's handler?

23:46.014 --> 23:47.443
Don't worry. We got it taken care of.

23:47.467 --> 23:48.606
- Aah! Oh, man.
- Oh, God.

23:48.631 --> 23:49.748
Are you hurting 'cause you're old?

23:49.772 --> 23:51.117
No. I'm not hurting 'cause I'm old.

23:51.141 --> 23:52.350
- Ow! Yes!
- Ohh!

23:52.375 --> 23:53.809
I mean, not 'cause I'm
old... 'cause I'm...

23:53.833 --> 23:55.287
Yeah. It's okay.

23:55.289 --> 23:56.321
Oh, man.

23:59.890 --> 24:01.651
Park Lin, I need a quick word.

24:02.659 --> 24:05.461
Actually, we all need to talk to you.

24:05.486 --> 24:06.657
All three?

24:06.682 --> 24:07.696
Well, it's a...

24:07.721 --> 24:09.421
psychology, science...

24:09.446 --> 24:11.412
rugby-related matter.

24:11.505 --> 24:13.005
It's about your assignment.

24:13.030 --> 24:14.229
I turned in my paper.

24:14.254 --> 24:16.587
No, no... your government assignment.

24:17.330 --> 24:20.966
To monitor Yong and his
research so you can weaponize it.

24:20.991 --> 24:22.423
We read your e-mails.

24:24.849 --> 24:26.183
Okay.

24:26.208 --> 24:27.470
Before we all start shooting each other,

24:27.494 --> 24:28.793
I've got something to say.

24:28.818 --> 24:30.651
See, I know you're not a real student.

24:30.676 --> 24:33.344
But I did not appreciate
you chewing gum in my class.

24:33.369 --> 24:35.669
I thought it was rude and disrespectful,

24:35.694 --> 24:37.627
and I will not have it.

24:37.652 --> 24:38.985
And why does this matter?

24:39.010 --> 24:40.465
Oh, it doesn't. I'm just stalling.

24:40.490 --> 24:42.745
See, I switched your gum
with some gum that I drugged.

24:42.770 --> 24:45.003
It should've knocked you out by now.

24:45.903 --> 24:47.110
And there it is.

24:47.135 --> 24:48.257
Hey, hey, I gotcha, buddy.

24:48.282 --> 24:49.314
Ooh!

24:49.339 --> 24:51.515
Professor, I had a question about

24:52.446 --> 24:54.765
Oh, Park Lin, cheer up!

24:54.790 --> 24:57.883
It's one bad grade. You can make it up.

24:57.885 --> 25:00.652
Shhhhh. It's okay, buddy.

25:00.677 --> 25:02.532
Okay. I'll come back later.

25:02.557 --> 25:03.634
Thank you.

25:03.659 --> 25:05.134
That's all right.

25:05.159 --> 25:06.253
Woof!

25:07.372 --> 25:08.965
He was heavy.

25:08.990 --> 25:10.051
Ooh! Gum.

25:10.076 --> 25:11.175
- Oh!
- Aah! No, Ray!

25:11.200 --> 25:13.372
That is, uh... sleepy gum.

25:13.397 --> 25:14.585
Oh, right!

25:14.610 --> 25:16.076
'Cause...

25:16.101 --> 25:18.001
Right.

25:18.026 --> 25:19.748
I-I don't understand.

25:19.773 --> 25:21.707
All my research is dedicated to building

25:21.709 --> 25:24.509
a faster magnetic railway
system in my country.

25:24.511 --> 25:26.612
Your country plans on
using your technology

25:26.614 --> 25:28.380
to develop long-range weapons.

25:30.028 --> 25:31.562
This isn't fair.

25:31.955 --> 25:33.788
I-I just wanted to help people.

25:33.813 --> 25:35.132
I know. Look, Yong...

25:35.992 --> 25:37.132
Oh...

25:37.157 --> 25:38.190
Geez.

25:38.192 --> 25:39.359
Here.

25:41.700 --> 25:42.761
So old.

25:42.763 --> 25:43.962
This isn't your fault, all right?

25:43.964 --> 25:45.191
You didn't do anything wrong.

25:45.216 --> 25:46.726
Yet.

25:46.934 --> 25:50.240
I don't want to be involved
with anything that hurts people.

25:51.171 --> 25:52.326
H-How can I help?

25:52.351 --> 25:54.406
Well, we need to get our
hands on your research.

25:54.408 --> 25:55.866
And then we need to have a conversation

25:55.890 --> 25:57.143
about you defecting.

25:57.168 --> 25:59.135
I... have to defect?

25:59.160 --> 26:01.694
That's why I was trying so
hard to connect with you.

26:01.719 --> 26:02.993
Frankie even tried to motivate me

26:03.017 --> 26:04.483
by pretending she would kill you.

26:04.485 --> 26:05.584
"Pretending"?

26:05.586 --> 26:06.818
- Shh.
- Okay.

26:08.155 --> 26:09.889
So, what do you say, man?

26:09.914 --> 26:11.580
What now?

26:11.605 --> 26:14.706
We go to the lab and get my research.

26:16.596 --> 26:17.596
Good choice.

26:21.101 --> 26:22.875
The cheating professor
and his undergrad lover

26:22.899 --> 26:24.131
is my new favorite soap.

26:24.304 --> 26:26.138
I can't stop watching.

26:28.107 --> 26:30.075
The professor just
offered her a glass of wine

26:30.077 --> 26:32.200
in the classroom, and she declined.

26:32.225 --> 26:33.583
But she loves wine.

26:35.941 --> 26:37.549
- She's pregnant!
- She's pregnant!

26:37.551 --> 26:40.141
But... but I-I pulled
up his medical records.

26:40.166 --> 26:42.587
- He's had a vasectomy.
- Yeah.

26:43.855 --> 26:44.922
It's not his baby.

26:44.947 --> 26:46.480
Not his baby.

26:46.505 --> 26:48.861
That makes sense! It's
always someone else.

26:48.886 --> 26:50.095
It's just never as obvious.

26:51.122 --> 26:52.588
I'm so happy.

26:53.666 --> 26:56.335
You know, it makes me think.

26:56.704 --> 26:59.638
Park being Yong's handler
is pretty obvious, too.

26:59.640 --> 27:02.407
Yeah, I mean, it was almost too easy.

27:02.409 --> 27:03.642
He didn't even try to hide the fact

27:03.644 --> 27:05.444
that he was following Yong around.

27:05.446 --> 27:07.345
If Yong is such an important asset,

27:07.347 --> 27:09.548
do you really think they'd
only send one person?

27:09.550 --> 27:10.700
Well, if it was me,

27:10.725 --> 27:13.852
I'd have somebody else
deep undercover for backup.

27:14.654 --> 27:16.855
I will pull up our list of names.

27:17.824 --> 27:20.125
I'll pull up the footage.

27:20.127 --> 27:21.693
Until later, professor.

27:21.695 --> 27:24.062
You old heartbroken fool, you.

27:24.064 --> 27:25.864
Yes, obviously,

27:25.866 --> 27:28.934
you accomplished amazing things at MIT

27:28.936 --> 27:31.203
in the computer-science field.

27:31.205 --> 27:34.940
But I'm just saying, I'm
still smarter than you.

27:34.942 --> 27:36.775
Mm-hmm. I respect that.

27:36.777 --> 27:38.977
Believing in yourself and whatnot.

27:38.979 --> 27:41.713
All I'm saying is, no, you're not.

27:43.283 --> 27:44.742
... bitch.

27:46.325 --> 27:47.953
Oh, so, now you think I'm funny?

27:47.955 --> 27:49.955
See, you can't just judge smarts by I.Q.

27:49.957 --> 27:52.290
or whether or not you can build a superweapon.

27:54.917 --> 27:56.082
No.

27:56.107 --> 27:57.340
What?

27:57.365 --> 27:58.998
My hard drive is gone.

27:59.041 --> 28:00.474
That was all my research.

28:00.499 --> 28:02.532
Okay, I got to let my team know.

28:06.117 --> 28:07.483
Oh...

28:07.508 --> 28:10.123
Looks like that kid left
his laser project on.

28:15.057 --> 28:16.081
Get down!

28:17.134 --> 28:19.017
Go. Go!

28:22.189 --> 28:24.589
You know, you should really
consider transferring.

28:26.596 --> 28:28.877
You had me worried. Are you okay, kiddo?

28:28.902 --> 28:29.917
Yeah, we're good.

28:29.942 --> 28:31.603
Yong's packing up now,
then we're heading there.

28:31.627 --> 28:32.793
Okay, yeah. Stay safe.

28:32.795 --> 28:34.543
Look, Frankie wants to say "hi."

28:34.568 --> 28:35.574
Okay.

28:36.120 --> 28:37.519
Don't get killed.

28:39.105 --> 28:40.473
Hi, Frankie.

28:41.769 --> 28:42.938
Went back through the records

28:42.963 --> 28:45.797
and cross-referenced all the
students in Yong's classes

28:45.822 --> 28:48.079
with new transfers. We got three hits.

28:48.104 --> 28:50.410
Park... who's upstairs,
being interrogated.

28:50.412 --> 28:53.613
Reginald "Reggie"
Kensington... that's Standish.

28:53.615 --> 28:55.215
Picked his own cover name.

28:55.217 --> 28:56.550
'Course he did.

28:56.552 --> 28:58.719
And this woman... Claire Bisset.

28:58.721 --> 29:01.955
Former French intelligence,
now freelance gun for hire.

29:01.957 --> 29:03.924
I knew her flirty
thing had to be an act.

29:03.926 --> 29:06.693
Man! I was so excited that college
girls still thought I was cute.

29:06.695 --> 29:08.061
I'm sorry. Do you
wish I never found out,

29:08.063 --> 29:09.930
and eventually, she
shot you in the head?

29:09.932 --> 29:12.042
Part of me does, Susan.
Yeah. Part of me does.

29:12.944 --> 29:15.091
The second she uploads that
research off that hard drive,

29:15.115 --> 29:16.803
we're done. Mission's failed.

29:16.828 --> 29:18.362
To transfer a file that
big, she's gonna need

29:18.386 --> 29:20.255
a high-speed connection... T3 or higher.

29:20.280 --> 29:21.419
Well, we already looked.

29:21.444 --> 29:24.624
The only place on campus with
enough bandwidth is the library.

29:24.649 --> 29:25.948
Great. You guys get going.

29:25.973 --> 29:27.848
We'll wait here for Standish and Yong

29:27.850 --> 29:29.084
so we can take him to
the State Department

29:29.108 --> 29:31.052
- and start processing his defection.
- Okay.

29:31.077 --> 29:32.576
Oh, hey, Susan.

29:32.601 --> 29:34.622
Uh, if you get a chance
to question Claire...

29:35.679 --> 29:37.913
make sure to ask her, you
know, if the flirting was...

29:37.938 --> 29:39.071
was an act or not.

29:40.957 --> 29:42.890
I'm embarrassed for you.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.682
I'm okay with it.

29:45.898 --> 29:47.330
I don't believe it.

29:47.355 --> 29:49.355
I'm telling you, man,
that's my girlfriend.

29:49.716 --> 29:51.850
But she's so... hot.

29:51.875 --> 29:53.488
Thank you, boy I've never met.

29:53.513 --> 29:55.946
I'd love to talk, but I'm kind
of in the middle of something.

29:55.971 --> 29:58.968
Get your ass on the ground!

29:58.993 --> 30:00.960
I'll see you at home, boo.

30:03.613 --> 30:04.698
You're so lucky.

30:04.723 --> 30:06.489
Yeah, she fine.

30:06.514 --> 30:08.481
I'm not really good with people.

30:08.506 --> 30:10.299
I don't really have a lot of friends.

30:10.324 --> 30:12.157
Well, wait till you
get to the States, man.

30:12.182 --> 30:14.015
You don't know how
your life will turn out.

30:14.040 --> 30:15.339
I don't know.

30:15.364 --> 30:17.765
This is all happening so fast.

30:17.790 --> 30:20.224
You're not having second
thoughts about defecting?

30:20.249 --> 30:22.184
I got a text.

30:22.935 --> 30:24.935
My supervisors are upset

30:24.960 --> 30:27.155
that they don't have my research yet.

30:27.180 --> 30:29.280
They're sending a team to pick me up.

30:29.305 --> 30:31.572
You're not gonna go with them, are you?

30:32.294 --> 30:33.861
What's the point?

30:33.886 --> 30:37.488
As long as I'm alive,
they'll keep coming for me.

30:37.999 --> 30:39.465
But we can keep you safe.

30:39.490 --> 30:41.424
Besides, they're just gonna
make you build more weapons.

30:41.448 --> 30:43.482
Can you promise me your country won't?

30:44.968 --> 30:48.309
It's usually easy for me
to find the answers, but...

30:48.847 --> 30:51.581
this is... just a lot.

30:51.943 --> 30:54.944
Look, man, I hear you, all right?

30:54.946 --> 30:56.479
I've been exactly where you are.

30:56.481 --> 30:59.415
Since taking this gig,
I've been in over my head

30:59.417 --> 31:00.850
and not sure who I can trust.

31:00.852 --> 31:02.451
And I'm pretty sure
one of my new friends

31:02.453 --> 31:03.986
would shoot me if she
got annoyed enough.

31:03.988 --> 31:05.021
Your girlfriend?

31:05.789 --> 31:06.989
I actually meant Frankie,

31:06.991 --> 31:08.921
but yeah, no, that applies to her, too.

31:09.733 --> 31:11.233
What should I do?

31:12.721 --> 31:13.788
I don't know.

31:14.898 --> 31:17.900
All I can really do is
stand in front of you,

31:17.902 --> 31:19.602
look you in the eye, and tell you

31:19.604 --> 31:21.437
that I'm your friend
and I got your back.

31:22.339 --> 31:24.620
You just got to decide
whether or not you trust me.

31:25.862 --> 31:27.143
Thank you, Reggie.

31:29.380 --> 31:31.180
It's actually "Standish."

31:32.583 --> 31:33.749
But we good from here on.

31:33.751 --> 31:35.802
From here, nothing but truth.

31:35.827 --> 31:37.794
I like "Reggie" better.

31:44.986 --> 31:46.285
I don't know, guys.

31:46.310 --> 31:48.007
Maybe she's just a normal college co-ed

31:48.032 --> 31:50.399
studying with three muscular assassins.

31:53.017 --> 31:54.517
This is odd.

31:55.240 --> 31:57.340
The outbound connection isn't
going to Yong's government.

31:57.342 --> 31:58.808
It's going to Moscow.

31:58.810 --> 32:00.987
She's double-crossing
them... selling it for profit.

32:01.012 --> 32:02.178
Oh, Claire.

32:02.480 --> 32:03.962
The minute she came into my class,

32:03.987 --> 32:05.314
I knew she was a go-getter.

32:05.316 --> 32:06.549
Okay, how do we take them?

32:06.551 --> 32:07.917
There's too many exits
if they try and run.

32:07.919 --> 32:09.552
- I got that covered.
- All right.

32:11.589 --> 32:13.076
Okay, so, Dimitri,

32:13.101 --> 32:14.657
the money just came
through to my account,

32:14.659 --> 32:17.704
and I'm starting the
transfer of the hard drive...

32:17.729 --> 32:18.761
now.

32:20.097 --> 32:22.398
We got about 30 seconds
before their transfer ends.

32:22.400 --> 32:23.766
We need to move.

32:25.192 --> 32:26.359
- Let's go.
- Okay.

32:30.675 --> 32:32.675
If you can't take out
Claire, grab the hard drive.

32:32.677 --> 32:34.511
10 seconds. We're running
out of time. Come on.

33:00.605 --> 33:02.204
I did both.

33:02.206 --> 33:03.306
In heels.

33:06.760 --> 33:08.060
Ugh!

33:09.895 --> 33:11.729
Nice, Tomas!

33:13.251 --> 33:15.551
I love that guy!

33:15.553 --> 33:19.388
He's like a 14th-year
sophomore or something, but...

33:19.390 --> 33:21.090
Great job, Tomas!

33:21.092 --> 33:24.527
So, we got all Yong's data
back, and Claire's in custody.

33:24.529 --> 33:25.628
Great work.

33:25.630 --> 33:27.226
Were you, uh, were you able to get

33:27.251 --> 33:29.184
that other information that we needed?

33:29.666 --> 33:31.741
I knocked all of Claire's teeth out

33:31.766 --> 33:34.403
before I could find out if she
really thought you were cute.

33:34.405 --> 33:35.571
Hmm.

33:35.573 --> 33:37.273
So, I guess we'll never know.

33:37.275 --> 33:38.574
Trust me... we know.

33:39.903 --> 33:41.304
First time running point.

33:41.329 --> 33:44.013
You got the database back,
and you got an asset to defect.

33:44.015 --> 33:45.281
Congrats, Standish.

33:45.283 --> 33:46.482
This is a big day.

33:46.484 --> 33:48.017
Hey, where's, uh, where's Yong?

33:48.835 --> 33:50.169
He's gone.

33:55.659 --> 33:56.859
What do you mean he's gone?

33:56.861 --> 33:58.695
Yong's government contacted him.

33:58.720 --> 33:59.744
I never thought he would go,

33:59.768 --> 34:00.803
but then he said he had
to go to the bathroom,

34:00.827 --> 34:02.828
and then he just bolted
before I could do anything,

34:02.906 --> 34:04.006
and he just left with them!

34:04.031 --> 34:05.203
I-I know he didn't want to go.

34:05.227 --> 34:07.518
Oh, you know that? What
are you, a mind reader now?

34:07.543 --> 34:08.601
No, he's my friend!

34:08.626 --> 34:10.485
I know he doesn't want to make
weapons for the rest of his life.

34:10.510 --> 34:12.377
Maybe Yong played you? He's very smart.

34:12.379 --> 34:14.290
No! I-I'm smarter than he is.

34:14.315 --> 34:15.647
We already had that fight.

34:15.649 --> 34:17.627
I... You don't get it. He's just scared!

34:17.652 --> 34:18.768
I know where they're taking him.

34:18.793 --> 34:20.002
We can go get him right now!

34:20.027 --> 34:21.460
No, we can't.

34:21.485 --> 34:22.913
Look, he was at a foreign university

34:22.937 --> 34:24.123
by himself. That was our window.

34:24.147 --> 34:26.786
We are not authorized to engage
with foreign agents without orders.

34:29.228 --> 34:31.663
Sorry, Standish. It's over.

34:33.628 --> 34:35.396
No. It's not.

34:35.703 --> 34:38.837
I'm gonna go get him
with or without y'all.

34:39.277 --> 34:40.643
I'll see y'all later.

34:43.393 --> 34:44.793
This is all your fault!

34:44.819 --> 34:46.745
He cares about the asset
because you coddled him

34:46.746 --> 34:48.301
with your hugs and
your emotional support!

34:48.324 --> 34:49.925
Are you kidding me? This one's on you.

34:49.949 --> 34:52.051
You're such a rebel, always
doing whatever the hell you want.

34:52.074 --> 34:53.661
You made him impulsive.

34:53.687 --> 34:55.054
I hope you're happy.

34:55.056 --> 34:57.056
Uh, "Mom"? "Dad"?

34:57.058 --> 34:58.657
If you're done fighting, we all know

34:58.659 --> 35:00.259
you're coming with me to get this, so...

35:00.284 --> 35:01.785
Fine.

35:02.518 --> 35:03.717
This isn't finished.

35:03.742 --> 35:05.909
We're talking about this in the car.

35:06.205 --> 35:09.211
_

35:13.741 --> 35:15.741
I just intercepted
some military chatter.

35:15.743 --> 35:17.142
It says that Yong is being transferred

35:17.144 --> 35:19.445
to a military team for extraction.

35:19.447 --> 35:20.846
They're gonna have to smuggle him out,

35:20.848 --> 35:23.749
so keep your eyes peeled
for that other team.

35:23.751 --> 35:25.245
I miss your rugby shirt.

35:25.270 --> 35:26.346
Yeah, me too.

35:26.371 --> 35:27.385
Tomas took it from me

35:27.410 --> 35:29.988
when he found out I
wasn't a real rugby coach.

35:32.992 --> 35:35.194
All right, you heard Ray.
We got to get Yong now.

35:35.196 --> 35:37.896
Standish, you create a
distraction and draw them out.

35:37.898 --> 35:39.765
Will and I will light them up.

35:39.767 --> 35:41.200
- Ooh.
- Yeah, negative.

35:41.202 --> 35:42.935
Again, this is not a
sanctioned operation.

35:42.937 --> 35:44.462
Killing one of them could start a war.

35:44.487 --> 35:46.052
So?

35:46.077 --> 35:48.173
So, generally speaking, wars are bad.

35:48.175 --> 35:50.876
Fine. I won't shoot anybody.

35:50.878 --> 35:52.044
But I'm not gonna like it.

35:52.046 --> 35:53.712
No one said you had to.

35:53.714 --> 35:55.681
All right, Standish, distraction time.

35:55.683 --> 35:56.949
What am I supposed to do?

35:56.951 --> 35:58.417
You're on point. You'll figure it out.

35:58.419 --> 36:00.052
Yeah. We believe in you.

36:01.012 --> 36:02.213
Thanks, guys.

36:03.535 --> 36:05.002
Think he bought it?

36:05.027 --> 36:06.160
I don't know.

36:06.185 --> 36:07.851
Distraction... distraction...

36:07.876 --> 36:09.976
Got to find a distraction.

36:29.959 --> 36:31.559
All right, Standish.

36:34.388 --> 36:35.489
_

36:35.514 --> 36:36.814
Yong!

36:36.839 --> 36:39.101
Couldn't let you leave
without saying goodbye, man.

36:39.126 --> 36:40.292
Standish?

36:40.294 --> 36:43.862
- _
- ♪ I will remember you ♪

36:43.864 --> 36:45.631
Oh, God. He's singing.

36:45.633 --> 36:48.634

36:48.636 --> 36:49.735
It's Sarah McLachlan!

36:49.737 --> 36:51.837
I actually love this song.

36:51.839 --> 36:53.338
- Not anymore.
- Mm.

36:53.340 --> 36:55.073
♪ ... pass you by ♪

36:55.075 --> 36:57.342

Aaah!

37:15.329 --> 37:17.073
Oh! Damn!

37:18.199 --> 37:19.298
Oh!

37:21.168 --> 37:22.212
Now.

37:32.118 --> 37:33.819
Time to go.

37:33.844 --> 37:35.143
You don't have to do this.

37:35.168 --> 37:36.467
Yeah, but we doing it. Come on.

37:39.887 --> 37:41.620
Yong, what are you doing?

37:45.025 --> 37:46.925
No more running.

37:46.927 --> 37:48.360
I'm tired of being a pawn.

37:49.162 --> 37:50.596
They tell me I was saving lives,

37:50.598 --> 37:52.130
but I was really building a weapon.

37:52.132 --> 37:53.945
You tell me you're a student,
but you're really a spy.

37:53.969 --> 37:55.977
- Nothing's real.
- I am. You know that.

37:56.002 --> 37:57.035
No, I don't.

37:57.037 --> 37:59.071
I go with you, and what happens?

37:59.073 --> 38:00.138
You lock me up?

38:00.140 --> 38:01.673
- Yong!
- Whoa, Yong. Unh-unh.

38:01.675 --> 38:03.475
This is not the right choice, my friend.

38:03.477 --> 38:04.843
Put the gun down.

38:04.845 --> 38:07.312
These men want to use you. We don't.

38:07.314 --> 38:08.413
Yong, listen to me.

38:08.415 --> 38:10.015
Hey. Look at me.

38:10.783 --> 38:12.351
Standish believes in you.

38:12.353 --> 38:13.919
He came here to save you.

38:13.921 --> 38:16.021
No one can save me but me.

38:54.728 --> 38:57.029
Safe now, man. You can get up.

39:00.601 --> 39:02.000
You didn't tell me it was going to hurt.

39:02.002 --> 39:04.569
Well, it hurts a lot less
than the actual thing.

39:04.571 --> 39:06.371
- sYou faked it?
- Well, yeah.

39:06.373 --> 39:07.602
They were never gonna leave him alone

39:07.626 --> 39:08.674
unless they thought he was dead.

39:08.676 --> 39:09.875
Why didn't you tell us your plan?!

39:09.877 --> 39:11.109
Well, it had to seem real.

39:11.111 --> 39:13.178
Plus, you two aren't the best actors.

39:16.483 --> 39:18.417
Using our words against us.

39:18.419 --> 39:19.651
He gets that from you.

39:35.668 --> 39:36.705
Guys?

39:36.730 --> 39:38.330
- Shhhh!
- W-What's up, Will?

39:38.332 --> 39:39.764
The mission's over.

39:39.789 --> 39:41.507
You need to stop spying on
this professor and his student.

39:41.531 --> 39:43.532
- Come on. Let's turn it off.
- That is never gonna happen.

39:43.556 --> 39:45.623
He's about to get the
results of his paternity test.

39:45.625 --> 39:47.363
He seems devastated.

39:47.388 --> 39:48.626
I think he already knows.

39:48.667 --> 39:49.699
Suze.

39:51.019 --> 39:52.053
Come on.

39:53.239 --> 39:54.373
Will's right.

39:54.398 --> 39:56.021
We... We should stop.

39:56.046 --> 39:57.335
- No.
- Yeah, no. It's...

39:57.337 --> 39:58.836
- I don't think I can.
- Yeah, no, it's... it's...

39:58.838 --> 40:00.204
- I...
- Yeah.

40:00.206 --> 40:01.506
Thank you.

40:01.508 --> 40:03.508
You did the right thing.

40:04.654 --> 40:06.157
I guess... we should go get some drinks?

40:06.181 --> 40:07.257
Are you high?

40:07.282 --> 40:08.414
Turn it back on!

40:08.439 --> 40:09.881
- I'm so happy.
- I know.

40:09.883 --> 40:13.739
So, Yong is settling in at
his new, safe university,

40:13.764 --> 40:15.997
and he will finish his
degree under a new identity.

40:16.022 --> 40:17.822
Unfortunately, no one
can know where he is.

40:17.824 --> 40:19.123
But since we're spies...

40:19.125 --> 40:20.858
Yeah, I'm gonna see him next weekend.

40:20.860 --> 40:22.427
Hey, Standish, you did a great job.

40:23.195 --> 40:25.296
My man running point on a mission.

40:25.298 --> 40:26.531
Very sexy.

40:27.366 --> 40:30.368
That being said, if you ever
call me again while I'm working

40:30.370 --> 40:31.669
just to show me off,

40:31.671 --> 40:33.204
I will shoot you.

40:36.308 --> 40:37.842
I think she would.

40:38.844 --> 40:42.380
Hey, guys, look, I got to,
um... tell you "Thank you"...

40:42.382 --> 40:43.790
for everything you did.

40:43.815 --> 40:47.062
You've taught me a lot of things
in very, very different ways,

40:47.087 --> 40:49.988
but I wouldn't be the agent I
am today if it wasn't for y'all.

40:49.990 --> 40:51.522
Don't... No, don't put that on us.

40:51.524 --> 40:53.900
Yeah. I don't want the
credit for your lame-ass work.

40:55.183 --> 40:56.749
Love you guys, too.

40:58.148 --> 40:59.782
It's not a big deal.

41:00.615 --> 41:01.949
Don't get sappy.

41:02.202 --> 41:03.968
We trained him well.

41:03.970 --> 41:05.903
It's like you don't listen.

41:08.208 --> 41:10.608
Hey. I didn't think you guys
would actually stop watching.

41:10.610 --> 41:12.211
Mm. We didn't.

41:12.236 --> 41:13.266
It ended.

41:13.291 --> 41:15.280
Yeah. The baby was the professor's.

41:15.305 --> 41:17.374
The vasectomy didn't take,
and he's marrying her.

41:17.399 --> 41:18.750
But get this...

41:18.752 --> 41:21.252
he's not divorcing the wife,
and neither of them know.

41:21.254 --> 41:23.509
- What?!
- I think it's gonna work out.

41:23.534 --> 41:25.133
Sounds exciting.

41:30.996 --> 41:32.797
You need help, there, Ray?

41:32.799 --> 41:34.565
No. Unh-unh. I'm good.

41:34.567 --> 41:36.634
Um, w-whatcha got?

41:36.636 --> 41:38.636
It's the kid's first time running point.

41:38.638 --> 41:39.794
It's kind of a big deal.

41:39.819 --> 41:40.985
Yeah, it is.

41:41.010 --> 41:42.099
Oh, stop.

41:42.124 --> 41:44.878
So, I figured we could maybe
put this up on the wall.

41:44.903 --> 41:45.910
You know, commemorate it.

41:45.935 --> 41:46.944
Check it out.

41:46.946 --> 41:48.132
Oh, hey.

41:48.157 --> 41:50.114
- Hey! That's great!
- Ohh!

41:50.116 --> 41:52.016
- It's actually not that bad.
- Wow.

41:52.018 --> 41:53.918
Hey, guys, to college.

41:53.920 --> 41:56.120
To college.

41:56.122 --> 41:57.355
Cheers.

41:58.597 --> 42:00.324
Okay, tell me I couldn't
be a grad student.

42:00.326 --> 42:01.859
You couldn't be a grad student.

42:01.861 --> 42:03.528
- Not at all.
- No. No.
