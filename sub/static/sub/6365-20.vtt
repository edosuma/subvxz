00:01.201 --> 00:02.434
<i>Previously on</i> reign...

00:02.436 --> 00:04.737
Outside the castle--
or anywhere, really--

00:04.739 --> 00:07.239
Without a
personal guard.

00:07.241 --> 00:08.607
By order of the queen mother.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.209
You know, I don't
even know your name.

00:10.211 --> 00:11.243
General renaude.

00:11.245 --> 00:13.112
Kenna:
General, is it?

00:13.114 --> 00:15.314
My enemies at court
multiply by the day.

00:15.316 --> 00:17.383
Francis and catherine
hate me for being with you;

00:17.385 --> 00:18.784
The rest hate me
for being protestant.

00:18.786 --> 00:20.285
They want my head, mary.

00:20.287 --> 00:21.253
I have to leave.

00:21.255 --> 00:22.755
I'm lord akers.

00:22.757 --> 00:25.324
Elizabeth's envoy?
Face your fate in France,

00:25.326 --> 00:27.026
Or seek elizabeth's hand
in marriage.

00:27.028 --> 00:29.028
Catherine: <i>You won't believe</i>
<i>what condÃ©'s done.</i>

00:29.030 --> 00:30.729
<i>Married the queen of England</i>

00:30.731 --> 00:32.197
By proxy.

00:32.199 --> 00:34.366
If elizabeth has
a stronghold in France

00:34.368 --> 00:35.501
And condÃ©'s claim to the throne,

00:35.503 --> 00:38.370
This may mean the
end of our reign.

00:38.372 --> 00:41.106
Akers:
Every last document signifying
your union has been destroyed.

00:41.108 --> 00:42.441
It seems that someone
is out to erase

00:42.443 --> 00:45.044
All evidence of your wedding,
prince condÃ©.

00:46.246 --> 00:48.380
â™ª

00:57.157 --> 00:59.224
â™ª you prey on me

00:59.226 --> 01:02.327
â™ª my fragile soul

01:02.329 --> 01:05.130
â™ª into the darkness

01:05.132 --> 01:06.432
â™ª I fear I'll fall...

01:06.434 --> 01:09.234
Tell me what you want.

01:09.236 --> 01:10.502
â™ª devour me...

01:10.504 --> 01:11.770
No.

01:11.772 --> 01:14.406
You have to tell me
what you want.

01:14.408 --> 01:19.278
â™ª my divinity, my divinity...

01:19.280 --> 01:20.546
(gasps)

01:20.548 --> 01:23.782
â™ª ah... Devour me

01:26.219 --> 01:30.255
â™ª ah...

01:30.257 --> 01:33.425
Renaude:
<i>My men have his description.</i>

01:33.427 --> 01:35.227
We've blanketed
the area,

01:35.229 --> 01:36.495
And moved out through the woods.

01:37.530 --> 01:39.531
<i>Today's market day.</i>

01:39.533 --> 01:42.134
<i>We're questioning</i>
<i>villagers, farmers.</i>

01:42.136 --> 01:45.304
<i>Anyone who seems to fit</i>
<i>condÃ©'s description,</i>

01:45.306 --> 01:46.638
<i>No matter their rank, is held</i>

01:46.640 --> 01:48.307
<i>Till I can have</i>
<i>a look at them.</i>

01:48.309 --> 01:50.642
We'll find the traitor, my lord.

01:55.615 --> 01:57.316
It's a pity
we don't know

01:57.318 --> 01:59.451
Who set that fire
at condÃ©'s townhouse.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.886
Clearly,
whoever it was

02:00.888 --> 02:02.855
Wished to erase his proxy
wedding with elizabeth.

02:02.857 --> 02:05.390
It would be
useful to know

02:05.392 --> 02:07.392
Who condÃ©'s friends
and enemies are.

02:07.394 --> 02:08.894
Yes, it would.

02:08.896 --> 02:10.496
You're dismissed.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.400
When next we hear of him,

02:15.402 --> 02:17.436
CondÃ© could be king
consort of England.

02:17.438 --> 02:19.638
CondÃ© and elizabeth together

02:19.640 --> 02:22.274
Holding a sword
pointed directly at France.

02:22.276 --> 02:23.342
He's not ambitious for power.

02:23.344 --> 02:24.476
Oh.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.178
He's just a man
in over his head,

02:26.180 --> 02:27.813
His enemies everywhere.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.815
He's just looking for a way
to survive this.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.384
I'm responsible
for this mess.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.553
It isn't fair
for me to even ask,

02:34.555 --> 02:36.855
But if we
find condÃ©...

02:36.857 --> 02:39.424
Let's allow him
to leave the country.

02:39.426 --> 02:41.426
Banishment
is enough.

02:41.428 --> 02:43.896
You're very forgiving of a man
who betrayed your heart.

02:43.898 --> 02:45.397
Yes, he betrayed me.

02:45.399 --> 02:46.832
Do you think I don't feel that?

02:46.834 --> 02:49.201
I ask

02:49.203 --> 02:51.670
Despite it--
not out of love,

02:51.672 --> 02:53.906
But out of horror for what
I have done to his life.

02:53.908 --> 02:55.374
You had an affair

02:55.376 --> 02:56.742
And I allowed it.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.577
We all played our part,

02:58.579 --> 02:59.845
But condÃ© was the only one

02:59.847 --> 03:01.613
Who wed this nation's enemy.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.482
Your enemy.

03:04.918 --> 03:07.486
He has committed treason,

03:07.488 --> 03:09.688
And the punishment
for treason is death.

03:13.560 --> 03:14.726
Please.

03:19.299 --> 03:21.600
(fast tempo acoustic
intro playing)

03:24.504 --> 03:26.805
â™ª they all need something

03:26.807 --> 03:31.677
â™ª to hold on to,
they all mean well â™ª

03:31.679 --> 03:35.414
â™ª you could never
feel my story â™ª

03:35.416 --> 03:39.218
â™ª it's all you know... Oh!

03:39.220 --> 03:42.421
â™ª

03:51.598 --> 03:52.664
Lady kenna.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.399
General renaude.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.001
Here you are, again,

03:56.003 --> 03:57.402
In the flesh.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.704
Again?

03:58.706 --> 04:00.339
You seem startled to see me.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.407
No. Why would I be?

04:02.409 --> 04:03.742
You're a frequent visitor
to court these days.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.444
King francis
must value

04:05.446 --> 04:07.713
Your services greatly.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.581
It's a man's duty to try
and raise his station--

04:09.583 --> 04:11.416
To better protect
those he loves

04:11.418 --> 04:12.718
And offer them some...

04:12.720 --> 04:13.952
Comforts in life.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.554
No, I find it
refreshing

04:15.556 --> 04:18.824
For a man speak so frankly
about ambition.

04:18.826 --> 04:21.660
Well, I'm always happy to know
I've pleased a lady.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.669
(knocking)

04:32.605 --> 04:34.606
Ah, leith,
you can help me.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.541
It's too lovely a day
to stay in the castle,

04:36.543 --> 04:37.776
So I'm going
to my hatmaker's

04:37.778 --> 04:40.612
To get my green bonnet
trimmed with gold thread.

04:40.614 --> 04:43.282
Well, why are you standing there
like a lump?

04:43.284 --> 04:44.583
Make ready a carriage.

04:46.853 --> 04:47.819
Uh...

04:49.322 --> 04:51.290
Amazing.

04:51.292 --> 04:52.591
The heaviest hat
in all of France.

04:55.528 --> 04:58.397
You've spoken with
my mother, haven't you?

04:58.399 --> 05:00.565
She told me that
the baron lyon desrochers

05:00.567 --> 05:02.367
Is staying in town.

05:02.369 --> 05:04.403
A very close friend of yours,
it seems?

05:04.405 --> 05:06.438
Lyon is the lover who imbued me

05:06.440 --> 05:09.074
With the sophistication
that I'm known for today.

05:09.076 --> 05:12.077
He was my mentor,
and I his muse.

05:12.079 --> 05:14.313
Lyon and I,
we are...

05:14.315 --> 05:15.747
Kindred spirits.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.549
Twin souls.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.584
Apparently, your mother doesn't
approve of your twin soul.

05:19.586 --> 05:21.386
She thinks he's
a bad influence on me

05:21.388 --> 05:22.754
Just because of
that incident in rome.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.756
Or maybe it was
the party in dijon.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.491
Which is ridiculous,

05:26.493 --> 05:28.860
Because everybody found
their clothes eventually,

05:28.862 --> 05:30.862
And the ambassador agreed
not to mention it.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.564
I don't know why she thinks
you two should be kept apart.

05:32.566 --> 05:35.567
She can't do it,
and neither can his family.

05:35.569 --> 05:36.768
His father tried to push him
into a marriage,

05:36.770 --> 05:38.537
But he got out of it
and came straight to me.

05:38.539 --> 05:42.107
He always said we'd set
this country on fire together.

05:43.609 --> 05:45.644
Come on.

05:45.646 --> 05:48.513
Who's to see if you
bring me to his door?

05:48.515 --> 05:49.815
I'll be so discreet.

05:49.817 --> 05:52.951
Can't you do
this tiny favor for me?

05:52.953 --> 05:54.653
One thing I will never do

05:54.655 --> 05:57.956
Is risk getting on
catherine de medici's bad side.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.825
You'd rather get
on my bad side?

05:59.827 --> 06:01.827
(laughs):
A million times,

06:01.829 --> 06:03.128
Yes.

06:08.568 --> 06:10.969
There's some
highborn widow here.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.438
Says she's looking
for her nephew,

06:13.440 --> 06:15.507
To haul him back home.
Well, send her to me.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.008
We can't have people
walking through,

06:17.010 --> 06:19.611
Disturbing the clientele.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.747
Madam,

06:21.749 --> 06:23.648
I assure you, your neph...

06:27.387 --> 06:28.687
Mary:
I've missed you.

06:28.689 --> 06:32.491
I wasn't sure
if you'd want to see me.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.666
(both panting)

06:46.439 --> 06:47.672
Oh...

06:47.674 --> 06:50.942
I keep thinking of
our fugitive prince.

06:50.944 --> 06:53.578
How unflattering.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.680
If you are gonna bring
another man into our bed,

06:55.682 --> 06:58.016
Must it be condÃ©?

06:58.018 --> 07:01.753
Well, he's a threat to my
family as long as he lives.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.155
Renaude will find him.

07:03.157 --> 07:08.026
His men are turning over
every blade of grass.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.829
But what if mary interferes

07:10.831 --> 07:13.098
In that unexpected way
that she has?

07:13.100 --> 07:14.666
(sighs)

07:14.668 --> 07:16.668
You could help me here.
Hmm?

07:16.670 --> 07:19.204
Well, perhaps mary's confided
in her ladies.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.640
You could speak with lola,

07:21.642 --> 07:24.676
And see if you can find
anything out.

07:24.678 --> 07:27.813
Why would I have any
special influence over lola?

07:27.815 --> 07:29.648
Well, you have spoken
with her often.

07:29.650 --> 07:32.818
Oh, it was a flirtation,
nothing more.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.853
No?

07:34.855 --> 07:39.024
Well, servants' rumors say,
impelled by

07:39.026 --> 07:40.826
Too much wine,

07:40.828 --> 07:43.662
She shamelessly
offered herself to you.

07:43.664 --> 07:46.031
Did the rumors add...

07:46.033 --> 07:49.034
That I turned her down?

07:49.036 --> 07:50.869
Yes.

07:50.871 --> 07:55.841
And that uncharacteristic
chivalry makes one think.

07:55.843 --> 07:59.845
Why should she get such special
consideration from a man

07:59.847 --> 08:01.913
Known for his conquests?

08:01.915 --> 08:03.748
And why are we
talking about lola

08:03.750 --> 08:07.085
When I thought the
subject was condÃ©?

08:07.087 --> 08:09.154
I-it isn't worth
so much attention.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.056
She was a passing
amusement.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.958
Prove it.

08:15.228 --> 08:18.830
How, exactly, would
I accomplish this?

08:18.832 --> 08:20.932
Do something unforgiveable.

08:28.875 --> 08:31.776
I understand you hear
a lot of news in this place.

08:31.778 --> 08:32.777
Rumors, gossip.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.679
Of course.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.082
Men come in here, they drink,
they boast to their friends,

08:37.084 --> 08:38.783
They boast
to my girls.

08:38.785 --> 08:42.187
Sometimes there's truth
under the boasting.

08:42.189 --> 08:44.256
Then I beg of you,
listen for me.

08:44.258 --> 08:46.658
Tell me if you hear
anything of condÃ©

08:46.660 --> 08:49.528
Or rumors of who might have
set that fire.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.596
Mary, of course
I'll help you.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.766
Good heavens.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.201
I suppose this means my girls

08:56.203 --> 08:57.936
Are working for
the queen of France.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.204
I suppose it does.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.907
And I suppose
the queen of France

09:01.909 --> 09:03.975
Should offer a retainer.

09:07.613 --> 09:10.081
Ah, leith.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.750
Back for another assignment?

09:11.752 --> 09:12.784
I appreciate the initiative.

09:12.786 --> 09:15.186
Leave us.
And I want ermine trim!

09:15.188 --> 09:17.556
Don't try and pawn off
cat's fur on me.

09:17.558 --> 09:20.892
Actually, I was

09:20.894 --> 09:23.194
Wondering about the
annulment that we spoke of.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.830
When might I
expect that?

09:25.832 --> 09:29.634
My boy,
annulments are not cheap.

09:29.636 --> 09:31.803
Yes, but I've done
as you've asked.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.939
I've brought
you money.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.941
A drop in the bucket,
for an annulment.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.076
You have no idea
the hands I have to grease,

09:38.078 --> 09:39.811
All the way up to the pope!

09:39.813 --> 09:41.279
I see.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.048
And how many more...
Assignments

09:43.050 --> 09:45.150
Must I perform before
I've brought you enough money?

09:45.152 --> 09:46.918
If you continue to be

09:46.920 --> 09:49.621
As successful
as you've begun, not long.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.122
Perhaps a few years.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.991
Must it take so long?

09:52.993 --> 09:56.094
There might be a way
to make it quicker.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.830
Tell me.

09:58.832 --> 10:04.069
In the map room of the castle,
there's a display of heirlooms,

10:04.071 --> 10:07.973
Amongst which
is a jeweled scabbard

10:07.975 --> 10:09.608
Said to have belonged
to charlemagne.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.810
As an intimate
of the place,

10:11.812 --> 10:13.878
You could slip in

10:13.880 --> 10:15.947
Without any trouble.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.616
You want me to bring you
the scabbard?

10:17.618 --> 10:18.850
(laughs):
God's grace, no.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.285
Me, a receiver
of stolen goods?

10:20.287 --> 10:21.820
(chuckles)

10:21.822 --> 10:24.990
Take it to a man
who disposes of such things--

10:24.992 --> 10:27.092
I will give you
his name--

10:27.094 --> 10:30.962
And when he pays you,
bring me the money.

10:32.198 --> 10:34.633
Well?

10:34.635 --> 10:36.935
Kenna: Not the most
promising bunch of nobles

10:36.937 --> 10:38.670
Here today.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.872
Am I imagining it, or are
men peering at me lately

10:40.874 --> 10:43.308
In the most
unseemly way?

10:43.310 --> 10:45.944
I thought general renaude
would have returned.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.346
He's an intriguing addition
to court, don't you think?

10:48.348 --> 10:50.982
Is that why you're
wearing a new dress

10:50.984 --> 10:52.384
And your
finest jewels?

10:52.386 --> 10:54.352
I've just been thinking
about him constantly.

10:54.354 --> 10:55.887
I even had a dream about him.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.222
I don't know
what to do about it.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.657
Well, what
can you do?

10:58.659 --> 10:59.891
You're married.

10:59.893 --> 11:02.127
Yes, but bash believes,
as the king's brother,

11:02.129 --> 11:03.962
He could be granted
an annulment.

11:03.964 --> 11:07.032
We were wed under duress,
we have no children.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.934
Really, the door is wide open
for me to find another.

11:09.936 --> 11:11.369
Oh, kenna, please give
it careful thought.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.104
You don't have a
lot of experience

11:13.106 --> 11:14.739
With this sort
of thing.

11:14.741 --> 11:17.976
I believe I have sufficient
experience, thank you.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.745
No, I mean, experience
making your own choices.

11:20.747 --> 11:22.747
Kenna: I make my own
choices every day.

11:22.749 --> 11:24.149
Lola: I don't mean
the little things,

11:24.151 --> 11:25.917
Like what
dress to wear.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.686
But do you realize

11:27.688 --> 11:30.221
That every relationship you've
had has been chosen for you?

11:30.223 --> 11:33.058
Henry essentially
claimed you,

11:33.060 --> 11:34.426
Your marriage to
bash was forced,

11:34.428 --> 11:37.162
Antoine set his
sights on you.

11:37.164 --> 11:38.229
I do see your point.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.232
All right, that's quite enough.

11:44.270 --> 11:46.104
What's going on here?

11:46.106 --> 11:47.172
Nothing, my lady.

11:47.174 --> 11:50.241
But you seem agitated.

11:50.243 --> 11:53.978
Perhaps your servant should
draw you a relaxing bath.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.313
(man snickers)
what is that?

12:03.756 --> 12:05.090
Did you see her face?

12:05.092 --> 12:07.092
Or was it not her face
you were looking at?

12:07.094 --> 12:08.493
(men laugh)
<i>(knocking on door)</i>

12:09.862 --> 12:11.996
This was left at
the gate for you.

12:19.004 --> 12:20.872
May I have a moment?

12:21.874 --> 12:23.274
(door closes)

12:23.276 --> 12:26.745
I've considered what
you asked of me,

12:26.747 --> 12:29.280
To allow condÃ© to escape rather
than execute him for treason.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.915
Yes?

12:30.917 --> 12:32.383
I've thought it over
seriously, and I promise

12:32.385 --> 12:35.086
This has nothing to do with
my feelings toward him.

12:35.088 --> 12:38.089
If the marriage
didn't take,

12:38.091 --> 12:39.524
CondÃ© could be
running to elizabeth

12:39.526 --> 12:42.127
To marry her right now.

12:42.129 --> 12:45.196
And I cannot allow a prince with
a claim to the french throne

12:45.198 --> 12:47.799
Go free and marry a
powerful foreign monarch,

12:47.801 --> 12:49.234
Let alone our enemy.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.369
I cannot allow him to live.

12:55.307 --> 12:57.442
You understand,
don't you?

12:57.444 --> 13:00.512
This is a matter of
this nation's security.

13:04.817 --> 13:06.885
I understand your reasons.

13:08.487 --> 13:10.388
I am sorry.

13:11.991 --> 13:13.091
Truly.

13:15.194 --> 13:16.528
What's that?

13:16.530 --> 13:19.430
Nothing.
Just an invitation.

13:23.536 --> 13:26.805
(door opens, closes)

13:45.357 --> 13:46.991
What have you done?

13:46.993 --> 13:48.393
I'm sorry.

13:48.395 --> 13:51.095
Sorry to my soul
for the pain you must feel,

13:51.097 --> 13:53.231
But I swear I didn't
do this to harm you.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.166
I know you felt forced to
marry elizabeth, but...

13:55.168 --> 13:57.168
But I'm not married.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.038
Every trace of proof is gone,
and her envoy abandoned me.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.841
I'm just trying to escape,
to survive,

14:02.843 --> 14:04.342
But the truth is
there's no way out.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.578
Not when you've
committed treason.

14:06.580 --> 14:08.179
My treason was in loving you.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.314
They would have
killed me,

14:09.316 --> 14:10.515
Francis or someone
close to him.

14:10.517 --> 14:11.583
They'd have found a way.

14:11.585 --> 14:14.586
Louis...
It's over for me.

14:14.588 --> 14:16.087
That's why I risked
coming to you,

14:16.089 --> 14:17.856
Even if you had
troops waiting.

14:17.858 --> 14:21.326
At least I could ask for
your forgiveness before I died.

14:21.328 --> 14:23.862
To tell you that my heart
is still yours,

14:23.864 --> 14:25.096
Despite what I've done.

14:25.098 --> 14:28.533
No, you can't give
up hope just yet.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.535
Can't you find refuge with
your brother in navarre?

14:30.537 --> 14:33.171
There's men looking all over
the countryside for me.

14:33.173 --> 14:34.939
Francis will never
let me get away.

14:36.642 --> 14:38.643
He won't even know you
slipped through his fingers.

14:38.645 --> 14:39.644
(sniffles)

14:39.646 --> 14:41.512
Let me think.

14:44.350 --> 14:46.584
Listen, there is a
tanner in the village,

14:46.586 --> 14:48.620
He provides clothing
for the court servants.

14:48.622 --> 14:51.389
I know that he is taking
a wagonload of skins

14:51.391 --> 14:53.191
To lille to be
made into coats.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.660
I can create
safe-conduct papers

14:55.662 --> 14:57.495
That say that you
are that tanner.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.497
They certainly wouldn't be
expecting the prince of condÃ©

14:59.499 --> 15:01.499
To be hauling a load
of animal skins.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.568
The men who are searching for
you only have your description.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.570
You don't even have
a portrait at court.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.639
But renaude has
seen you here.

15:07.641 --> 15:11.075
Your greatest risk will
be running into him.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.911
Still, there are
three checkpoints,

15:12.913 --> 15:14.445
And he can only be
at one at a time.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.447
I'll have to take that chance.

15:16.449 --> 15:20.151
I'll leave the papers and
instructions under these rocks.

15:20.153 --> 15:22.153
We can't risk
meeting again.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.923
For the rest of our lives.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.226
I hope that yours
is a long one.

15:34.333 --> 15:35.934
Go.

15:35.936 --> 15:36.935
(sniffles)

15:36.937 --> 15:38.569
Live.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.350
I could pay you
to bring me to lyon.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.018
I'm sure you could;
you're a princess.

15:54.020 --> 15:55.453
And you're a nobody.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.622
How much do nobodies make?

15:57.624 --> 15:59.257
I can top it.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.658
To make it worth my while?

16:00.660 --> 16:02.393
How about 50,000 livre?

16:02.395 --> 16:03.628
(chuckles)

16:03.630 --> 16:05.530
Is that all?

16:05.532 --> 16:07.398
Why not take my diamond
earrings? They're worth 60.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.335
Seriously,
what will it take?

16:10.337 --> 16:12.170
My lady, I would love to stay
chatting with you all day,

16:12.172 --> 16:13.604
But I have
other duties.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.073
Your mother's going out later,

16:15.075 --> 16:16.741
And she told me
to ready the gold carriage

16:16.743 --> 16:18.743
And to make sure there
is sufficient escorts

16:18.745 --> 16:20.278
For safety
on the road.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.280
Majesty.

16:42.301 --> 16:43.601
Claude:
Well, this is interesting.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.070
Princess.

16:46.072 --> 16:47.772
I was, uh,
taking this

16:47.774 --> 16:49.640
To be cleaned and...
Don't bother.

16:49.642 --> 16:52.043
Nobody asks castle guards
to see to the cleaning.

16:52.045 --> 16:55.113
And besides,
you've already lied once.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.714
Lied?

16:56.716 --> 16:59.417
My mother wouldn't step foot
in the gold carriage.

16:59.419 --> 17:02.687
She knows the color
reflects terribly on her skin.

17:02.689 --> 17:06.057
So I became curious as to
what you were really up to.

17:06.059 --> 17:09.060
Stealing from my family.

17:09.062 --> 17:12.196
It's my duty
to turn you in, you know.

17:12.198 --> 17:15.033
Maybe you'll just lose a hand.

17:15.035 --> 17:18.202
Though more likely, we being
the royal family and all...

17:19.538 --> 17:21.472
...You'll be hanged.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.074
Claude, please.

17:23.076 --> 17:25.143
Or we could come to
an understanding.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.782
Your new duties will
include escorting me

17:30.784 --> 17:32.784
To town to see
whomever I like

17:32.786 --> 17:34.786
And covering for
me with my mother.

17:41.760 --> 17:47.298
A sketch of me in the bath,
naked, graphically detailed.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.333
I don't know
which is more disturbing,

17:49.335 --> 17:52.470
Or the fact that you allowed it
into the hands of other nobles.

17:52.472 --> 17:54.172
The likeness is impressive.

17:54.174 --> 17:55.807
Oh, stop admiring your own work.

17:55.809 --> 17:57.175
Did you really think
I'd forget

17:57.177 --> 17:58.676
That I took a bath
in front of you?

17:58.678 --> 18:00.445
Well, that depends.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.513
I don't know who else
you've bathed in front of.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.515
Am I the only
one, for example,

18:04.517 --> 18:07.819
Who knows that you have a
charming little mole just here?

18:07.821 --> 18:09.220
Ugh.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.222
Very well, yes.

18:11.224 --> 18:12.657
I made the sketch.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.725
For my private
edification.

18:16.662 --> 18:20.231
But then I made a large
wager with lord travers.

18:20.233 --> 18:23.668
He bet that his paramour was the
most beautiful woman in court.

18:23.670 --> 18:27.305
I felt otherwise, so
offered your picture

18:27.307 --> 18:29.740
For the various nobles
to vote on the question.

18:31.543 --> 18:35.513
Sadly, though your beauty
is sublime,

18:35.515 --> 18:38.316
I lost the bet.

18:38.318 --> 18:41.552
You do realize that all the men
at court now believe

18:41.554 --> 18:43.154
I shared your bed.
Mm.

18:43.156 --> 18:45.256
All we did was talk.
You were naked

18:45.258 --> 18:46.390
At the time,

18:46.392 --> 18:48.559
But, uh, I do see your point.

18:48.561 --> 18:51.562
You told me
to protect my reputation,

18:51.564 --> 18:53.397
And now you've hurled it
in the mud.

18:53.399 --> 18:55.800
You said you cared about me,
and now you...

18:55.802 --> 18:59.604
I say a great
many things.

18:59.606 --> 19:02.406
The mistake was yours
in trusting me.

19:04.376 --> 19:06.277
Why are you doing this?

19:06.279 --> 19:07.478
You're not
the kind of person

19:07.480 --> 19:10.281
To hurt someone just for money.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.416
I took advantage
of the sufferings of others

19:12.418 --> 19:13.818
To build my holdings.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.654
I blackmailed the king,
I threatened the safety

19:16.656 --> 19:18.723
Of everyone he loved,
including you.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.458
A few people,

19:20.460 --> 19:22.193
I had kidnapped.
You have shown me

19:22.195 --> 19:23.394
That there is
another side to you.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.396
Which gave you the
assurance you needed

19:25.398 --> 19:28.833
To take a bath
in front of me,

19:28.835 --> 19:30.902
Revealing all the sides
there are to you.

19:30.904 --> 19:34.539
Do you think, because we
shared a few nice moments,

19:34.541 --> 19:36.374
That you saw
some good in me

19:36.376 --> 19:39.443
That no one else had
ever seen before?

19:39.445 --> 19:42.480
I can see quite clearly
the man before me now.

19:57.596 --> 20:00.298
I'm taking these skins
to the tannery at lille.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.368
Renaude: I hope you
understand, my lord.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.703
My men have
orders to hold

20:05.705 --> 20:07.705
Anyone who seems to
fit the description.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.373
I hardly think
your fugitive,

20:09.375 --> 20:11.742
Whoever he is,
resembles a man of noble blood.

20:11.744 --> 20:14.478
King francis
will hear of this.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.547
Be on the way to
your tannery, then.

20:19.585 --> 20:21.586
Renaude: You're the first
tanner I've ever met

20:21.588 --> 20:24.956
Who didn't have
stained hands.

20:24.958 --> 20:27.825
Prince louis of condÃ©.

20:31.430 --> 20:33.264
Wait out here.

20:33.266 --> 20:35.333
Try not to
steal anything.

20:39.705 --> 20:41.706
(both chuckle)

20:41.708 --> 20:44.308
At last you're here.

20:44.310 --> 20:45.710
(both laugh)

20:55.454 --> 20:58.289
I'm going to tell mary
that condÃ© has been captured.

20:58.291 --> 20:59.790
And that you've
given your approval

20:59.792 --> 21:01.492
For his immediate
execution?

21:01.494 --> 21:04.395
Yes. I'd rather
she heard it from me.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.998
(sighs) I understand that
you want to be gentle

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
In delivering the news,
but it won't matter.

21:09.002 --> 21:11.636
There is no way to
lessen this blow.

21:15.507 --> 21:18.476
(mary sobbing)

21:28.520 --> 21:30.721
Aren't you
going to tell her?

21:32.457 --> 21:34.458
She already knows.

21:43.702 --> 21:45.569
I've missed you.

21:45.571 --> 21:47.438
And I you.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.040
We have so much
catching up to do.

21:49.042 --> 21:51.876
Tomorrow, I'll have my man leith
take us to a place I know

21:51.878 --> 21:53.444
That's perfect for ice-skating.

21:53.446 --> 21:55.079
Then when we finish,

21:55.081 --> 21:57.581
I'll let you warm me up
in the carriage.

21:57.583 --> 21:58.683
Wouldn't I love that?

21:58.685 --> 22:01.819
But I'm only
passing through.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.621
I have an engagement in paris.

22:03.623 --> 22:05.523
Cancel it.

22:05.525 --> 22:06.590
I can't.

22:06.592 --> 22:08.526
Well, how soon
will you be back?

22:08.528 --> 22:10.027
I wanted you here to
help welcome mother.

22:10.029 --> 22:11.529
I know we can win
her approval.

22:11.531 --> 22:12.463
Approval for what?

22:12.465 --> 22:14.432
To be together,
of course.

22:14.434 --> 22:15.700
I can't wait

22:15.702 --> 22:17.535
To get you
out of this dreary inn

22:17.537 --> 22:18.536
And into a suite at court.

22:18.538 --> 22:21.005
Near mine.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.341
It'll be wonderful.

22:23.343 --> 22:26.610
The truth is I haven't got a lot
of friends at the castle.

22:26.612 --> 22:28.679
It's lonely.

22:30.482 --> 22:32.683
My claude...
(chuckles)

22:32.685 --> 22:34.418
Lonely?

22:34.420 --> 22:37.555
I am sure you have
a horde of gentlemen

22:37.557 --> 22:38.723
Following you about.

22:38.725 --> 22:41.592
And I'd love to be
one of them,

22:41.594 --> 22:42.960
If I had more time.

22:45.597 --> 22:49.467
I should be on my way if I want
to ride out before nightfall.

23:01.446 --> 23:03.114
Have you come
to kill me?

23:14.493 --> 23:15.960
Lord akers?

23:15.962 --> 23:18.562
Elizabeth sent us
to look out for you.

23:19.631 --> 23:20.965
Man:
My lord, the french!

23:20.967 --> 23:22.633
(horses neighing)

23:23.802 --> 23:27.004
Mount up! Away!

23:43.622 --> 23:45.756
Walk the horses.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.191
It'll make less noise.

23:47.193 --> 23:48.859
We'll take him
to the safe house.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.127
What's going on?

23:50.129 --> 23:51.796
You abandon me, you rescue me,

23:51.798 --> 23:53.030
You're speaking of a safe house?

23:53.032 --> 23:54.498
When I crossed
the channel,

23:54.500 --> 23:55.800
I found her majesty waiting
at dover

23:55.802 --> 23:57.535
To escort her new husband

23:57.537 --> 23:58.936
And give you good inspection,
I have no doubt.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.571
When I told her
of the fire,

24:00.573 --> 24:02.640
She sent me back on
the very same ship.

24:02.642 --> 24:04.675
We've had men watching at
every checkpoint for you.

24:04.677 --> 24:06.644
You mean she still wants
the marriage?

24:06.646 --> 24:08.479
She needs to
marry even more.

24:08.481 --> 24:10.047
By murdering the proxy,
elizabeth's enemies in England

24:10.049 --> 24:11.715
Have shown
their boldness.

24:11.717 --> 24:13.617
They're trying to tumble
her from the throne.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.085
She needs to secure
her position.

24:15.087 --> 24:17.721
Then why is she still interested
in wedding a mere prince?

24:17.723 --> 24:19.223
She's not.

24:19.225 --> 24:20.691
No more dukes and
princes for her.

24:20.693 --> 24:22.593
She's determined
to wed a king.

24:22.595 --> 24:23.928
I see.

24:23.930 --> 24:25.963
Someone who can join his kingdom
and power to hers,

24:25.965 --> 24:27.498
The perfect strategy.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.699
Yes.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.634
So I've been sent
to inform you

24:30.636 --> 24:33.571
That her majesty still rejoices
in the idea of marrying you,

24:33.573 --> 24:35.673
And she's ready to
give you her backing,

24:35.675 --> 24:37.541
If you take
the throne of France.

24:47.686 --> 24:49.587
Princess.

24:49.589 --> 24:50.988
Did I say you could leave?

24:50.990 --> 24:52.756
It's late;
my shift is over.

24:52.758 --> 24:54.592
I'll see you tomorrow.
But I need you tonight.

24:54.594 --> 24:56.894
Your first duty
is to me, remember?

24:56.896 --> 24:59.063
Right now,

24:59.065 --> 25:00.764
I'm hungry.

25:00.766 --> 25:02.233
Bring me a bottle of bordeaux

25:02.235 --> 25:03.901
And bread with
fresh butter,

25:03.903 --> 25:05.536
And wait in case
I require anything else.

25:05.538 --> 25:07.171
The servants
can help you.

25:07.173 --> 25:08.772
I have somewhere to be.

25:08.774 --> 25:10.007
Where?

25:10.009 --> 25:11.542
What could possibly be
more important

25:11.544 --> 25:12.810
Than your duty to me?

25:13.712 --> 25:15.679
It's her, isn't it?

25:15.681 --> 25:18.148
Your madam girlfriend.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.984
I was planning
on seeing her, yes.

25:19.986 --> 25:22.620
You just can't stand to be
away from her, can you?

25:22.622 --> 25:24.154
It's been all of ten hours,

25:24.156 --> 25:26.590
And you have to get
back to her side.

25:26.592 --> 25:27.758
I like being with her,
that's all.

25:27.760 --> 25:28.826
Clearly you're
not up to

25:28.828 --> 25:30.094
Handling both the needs

25:30.096 --> 25:31.996
Of your personal life
and my demands.

25:31.998 --> 25:33.731
She's distracting you.

25:33.733 --> 25:34.999
I won't stand for it.

25:35.001 --> 25:36.300
What do you mean?

25:37.802 --> 25:39.837
End your relationship
with that woman.

25:42.107 --> 25:44.041
Do you have to hurt

25:44.043 --> 25:45.876
Everyone else
because you're hurting?

25:45.878 --> 25:47.945
Must we all be
as miserable as you?

25:47.947 --> 25:50.548
Yes! And I'm
a princess,

25:50.550 --> 25:52.182
While you're nothing more
than a thief

25:52.184 --> 25:53.784
Whose life I
now control.

25:53.786 --> 25:55.052
Do as I say.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.287
Break things
off with her.

25:56.289 --> 25:57.821
No. I love greer.

25:57.823 --> 25:59.189
Love?

25:59.191 --> 26:02.293
Love is just a word
men use to enchant women.

26:02.295 --> 26:04.828
It's a game.
A game?

26:04.830 --> 26:06.730
A game is you telling me
to break a woman's heart

26:06.732 --> 26:08.799
Simply because you're feeling
out of sorts.

26:08.801 --> 26:09.700
I won't do it.

26:09.702 --> 26:11.335
How gallant,
risking death

26:11.337 --> 26:13.637
To protect your brothel
keeper's feelings.

26:13.639 --> 26:16.807
Why do you think I tried
to take that scabbard?

26:16.809 --> 26:19.710
To buy her an annulment
so that we could be married.

26:19.712 --> 26:22.646
Only, it cost a fortune,
more than I'll ever have.

26:22.648 --> 26:24.848
But I will do
whatever it takes

26:24.850 --> 26:27.918
To hold her in my arms
and call her my wife.

26:32.290 --> 26:35.359
I know you've had
a disappointment.

26:35.361 --> 26:37.895
But you're so young.

26:37.897 --> 26:42.700
Think of all the time you have
to meet your true love.

26:42.702 --> 26:45.736
And when you do,

26:45.738 --> 26:47.871
Be careful of your temper.

26:47.873 --> 26:51.241
It's so easy
to drive love away.

26:51.243 --> 26:53.243
Lectures bore me.

26:56.748 --> 26:58.382
Here.

26:58.384 --> 26:59.883
Take care of your
personal problems;

26:59.885 --> 27:01.619
I'm tired of
all of this.

27:01.621 --> 27:04.755
I don't want to hear her
name mentioned again.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.700
Thank you.

27:25.844 --> 27:30.247
I hear you are quite the artist.

27:30.249 --> 27:31.982
Lola will never
speak to me again.

27:31.984 --> 27:32.983
Good.

27:32.985 --> 27:36.787
I'm sorry, my dear,

27:36.789 --> 27:38.922
But you needed to be tested.

27:38.924 --> 27:43.427
As queen mother, I'm privy
to very sensitive information,

27:43.429 --> 27:47.264
State secrets that could
jeopardize the safety of France.

27:48.433 --> 27:50.734
To be in my inner circle,

27:50.736 --> 27:53.203
I need to be able
to trust you.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.272
Now I know I can.

27:55.274 --> 27:58.842
Should I pretend to believe
all that nonsense?

27:58.844 --> 28:00.344
(chuckles)

28:00.346 --> 28:02.446
You needed to do this

28:02.448 --> 28:04.348
Because your husband
bedded every woman he liked

28:04.350 --> 28:05.916
Throughout your marriage,

28:05.918 --> 28:08.719
And you came out of it believing
that you were unlovable,

28:08.721 --> 28:11.388
So you used power
to make me true.

28:11.390 --> 28:12.856
Don't flatter yourself.

28:12.858 --> 28:14.858
It's not your love
that I seek,

28:14.860 --> 28:16.060
But your allegiance.

28:16.062 --> 28:17.761
You have that.

28:17.763 --> 28:21.231
But, as a friend, I warn you,

28:21.233 --> 28:23.233
Beware.

28:23.235 --> 28:25.235
(chuckles)
of you?

28:25.237 --> 28:26.804
Of yourself.

28:26.806 --> 28:29.139
Don't be the first
to destroy something

28:29.141 --> 28:32.209
Just because you don't trust
that it's real.

28:32.211 --> 28:35.479
Give up this idea
that nobody can know you

28:35.481 --> 28:37.848
And still love you.

28:44.923 --> 28:47.157
I see you're
leaving us.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.760
I'm sorry,
and thank you for your help,

28:49.762 --> 28:51.995
But this...
This is madness.

28:51.997 --> 28:54.465
No, it's the
perfect moment.

28:54.467 --> 28:56.900
France is vulnerable
with troops away in scotland.

28:56.902 --> 28:58.469
French protestants
will rally behind you.

28:58.471 --> 29:00.838
Catholics will not.

29:00.840 --> 29:03.874
When francis dies,
your claim to the throne

29:03.876 --> 29:05.843
Will make you far more
attractive than charles.

29:05.845 --> 29:08.479
Having a mere boy as
king will make France

29:08.481 --> 29:10.013
Seem vulnerable.

29:10.015 --> 29:11.482
Even many catholics
despise the idea

29:11.484 --> 29:12.983
Of catherine de medici
as regent.

29:12.985 --> 29:15.018
Not to mention,
you have

29:15.020 --> 29:17.020
Your own army
to back your claim.

29:17.022 --> 29:18.388
In condÃ©.

29:18.390 --> 29:20.357
We can arrange
to bring your men to you.

29:20.359 --> 29:24.194
Add to that the might and power
of England at your back.

29:24.196 --> 29:27.431
This is how
dynasties are born,

29:27.433 --> 29:29.166
By taking what someone else has

29:29.168 --> 29:30.934
When that person
is at their weakest,

29:30.936 --> 29:32.936
As francis is now.

29:32.938 --> 29:35.806
The bourbon dynasty.

29:35.808 --> 29:39.777
But if you believe you are
better off running away,

29:39.779 --> 29:42.312
Then good luck to you.

29:45.016 --> 29:49.052
Francis: <i>You captured him,</i>
<i>and then you lost him.</i>

29:49.054 --> 29:51.889
Did it occur to you
to leave him under guard?

29:51.891 --> 29:54.124
I did, my lord.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.793
You gave me no warning

29:55.795 --> 29:57.060
That he might have
outside help.

29:57.062 --> 30:00.931
My men at the checkpoint
were massacred.

30:00.933 --> 30:03.934
But he had help
even before that, my lord.

30:03.936 --> 30:06.203
He had official papers,

30:06.205 --> 30:08.972
An identity to step into.

30:08.974 --> 30:10.974
French papers?

30:10.976 --> 30:12.910
Yes, your majesty.

30:12.912 --> 30:14.478
You may go.

30:20.585 --> 30:23.420
After all of this,

30:23.422 --> 30:25.489
Could mary
still be helping him?

30:25.491 --> 30:27.391
Yes.

30:27.393 --> 30:32.029
Out of guilt or affection,
even though he's lost to her.

30:32.031 --> 30:34.164
Has she no idea
what she risks?!

30:34.166 --> 30:39.269
Your forgiveness,
your protection, your mercy...

30:39.271 --> 30:41.338
Forever.

30:47.312 --> 30:49.413
General, it bodes
well for you

30:49.415 --> 30:51.882
That you're having an audience
with our king again so soon.

30:51.884 --> 30:53.951
In fact, his majesty
wasn't too pleased today.

30:53.953 --> 30:56.053
We suffered a setback
he did not appreciate.

30:56.055 --> 30:59.022
You don't seem too concerned by
the king's displeasure with you.

30:59.024 --> 31:00.958
Well, with the state of France
as it is,

31:00.960 --> 31:03.994
The king needs me around now
more than I need him.

31:03.996 --> 31:06.096
General, would you like
to escort me

31:06.098 --> 31:07.197
On a walk through the garden?

31:07.199 --> 31:08.398
A little brisk air

31:08.400 --> 31:10.000
Would be refreshing.

31:10.002 --> 31:12.002
I'm afraid I must prepare
for my departure tomorrow.

31:12.004 --> 31:14.238
We're expanding the search
for the fugitive,

31:14.240 --> 31:17.040
And I'll be making
a trip to amiens, as well,

31:17.042 --> 31:19.243
To meet a potential bride.

31:19.245 --> 31:21.411
A-a bride?

31:21.413 --> 31:23.513
To marry?
Her father only recently

31:23.515 --> 31:26.550
Contacted me wishing to arrange
a marriage contract,

31:26.552 --> 31:28.352
But I insisted
on an introduction first.

31:28.354 --> 31:30.053
Of course.

31:30.055 --> 31:32.055
You want to make sure
this bride suits you.

31:32.057 --> 31:33.457
It's for her sake, as well.

31:33.459 --> 31:36.894
A father may bestow
his daughter as he chooses,

31:36.896 --> 31:38.996
But I would never wed
unless I heard

31:38.998 --> 31:41.899
From a woman's own lips
that she desired me.

31:43.301 --> 31:45.102
Excuse me.

31:45.104 --> 31:46.270
I should go.

31:46.272 --> 31:47.604
Prepare for the journey.

31:53.111 --> 31:55.913
How could you do it?

31:55.915 --> 31:58.382
Do you deny helping condÃ©
behind my back?
No.

31:58.384 --> 32:01.084
Mary, I...

32:01.086 --> 32:02.686
Where is he now?

32:02.688 --> 32:04.154
Now?

32:04.156 --> 32:05.389
What do you mean?

32:05.391 --> 32:07.157
He was captured
by general renaude's men.

32:07.159 --> 32:08.425
He was rescued.

32:11.396 --> 32:13.463
I didn't know.
Do you realize

32:13.465 --> 32:15.365
That by helping condÃ© escape,
elizabeth could have

32:15.367 --> 32:17.301
A foothold in France?
And she could not.

32:17.303 --> 32:20.170
These are all
abstract future possibilities.

32:20.172 --> 32:22.039
A man's life was at stake.

32:22.041 --> 32:24.174
No. A lot of lives.

32:24.176 --> 32:26.343
CondÃ©'s army is loyal
to him personally.

32:26.345 --> 32:28.545
If he becomes
king consort of England,

32:28.547 --> 32:31.248
We will essentially have
an enemy army on our soil.

32:31.250 --> 32:34.584
Mary, this is the most dangerous
thing you have ever done.

32:34.586 --> 32:37.321
Do you really
love him that much?

32:37.323 --> 32:40.590
I thought that
this was about your healing,

32:40.592 --> 32:42.726
But now you've done what
a queen must never do:

32:42.728 --> 32:45.128
You've put the personal
above the political,

32:45.130 --> 32:48.398
His safety above
the nation's.

32:48.400 --> 32:51.201
Whatever happens to him,
it's over.

32:51.203 --> 32:53.971
I will never
see him again.

32:55.707 --> 32:58.642
You say that as if
somehow I've won.

33:00.511 --> 33:02.145
But how can it be over

33:02.147 --> 33:03.647
When he's so ingrained
in your heart?

33:03.649 --> 33:08.018
You will always see him just
as I will always see you:

33:08.020 --> 33:11.054
Naked in each other's arms.

33:28.072 --> 33:30.140
Ooh! (laughs)

33:32.377 --> 33:35.212
It's good to see you, too.

33:35.214 --> 33:36.646
I got you something.

33:36.648 --> 33:38.348
(giggles)

33:43.454 --> 33:46.156
Greer:
Leith, that's a fortune.

33:46.158 --> 33:48.191
That's your annulment.

33:48.193 --> 33:50.761
Now we can pay for it.

33:53.564 --> 33:56.266
It's unbelievable.

34:02.273 --> 34:03.640
Greer...

34:05.276 --> 34:07.778
...Will you be my wife?

34:09.747 --> 34:13.183
Uh... If...

34:15.420 --> 34:20.323
If we get married,
what will our lives be?

34:21.659 --> 34:23.226
What we've dreamed of.

34:23.228 --> 34:25.495
We can get a little
house in town,

34:25.497 --> 34:28.098
We can start a family.

34:28.100 --> 34:31.301
I have a reasonable
salary at court,

34:31.303 --> 34:33.303
And in time I'll get a better
appointment and then...

34:33.305 --> 34:35.505
What if you... Don't?

34:35.507 --> 34:38.341
What if you lose
the post you have now?

34:38.343 --> 34:40.410
That's not likely...

34:40.412 --> 34:42.746
Look at how quickly
your manor house was taken away.

34:42.748 --> 34:45.449
How quickly I was thrown
out of the castle

34:45.451 --> 34:47.317
When it was
politically expedient.

34:48.286 --> 34:50.353
We need more.

34:50.355 --> 34:52.422
You want to keep the brothel.

34:52.424 --> 34:55.192
â™ª

34:55.194 --> 34:57.194
Greer, you don't have to.

34:57.196 --> 34:59.863
I swear that I will
protect and support you

34:59.865 --> 35:01.498
For the rest of my life.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.333
What if you can't?

35:03.335 --> 35:06.436
This brothel
is independence.

35:06.438 --> 35:07.871
Income.

35:07.873 --> 35:10.674
And that is safety
in a very unsafe world.

35:10.676 --> 35:13.376
What if we take this money

35:13.378 --> 35:14.444
And invest it
in the business?

35:14.446 --> 35:15.712
If there's one thing

35:15.714 --> 35:17.214
You can count on,
year after year,

35:17.216 --> 35:18.448
It's that men want sex

35:18.450 --> 35:20.450
And they'll
pay for it.

35:20.452 --> 35:24.387
I thought we could count on
our love for one another.

35:24.389 --> 35:27.390
That's what I've always
believed, but you...

35:27.392 --> 35:30.260
Never have, have you?

35:30.262 --> 35:33.263
You're a fearful person, greer.

35:33.265 --> 35:36.566
I've made something of myself.

35:36.568 --> 35:38.735
It has taken courage
and fight...

35:38.737 --> 35:40.637
But you won't risk
fighting for us!

35:40.639 --> 35:43.807
Believing that we can battle
whatever comes our way.

35:43.809 --> 35:45.275
I've lost

35:45.277 --> 35:46.376
Too many battles.

35:46.378 --> 35:47.878
I've lost everything!

35:47.880 --> 35:50.614
And now I want
to hold on to something

35:50.616 --> 35:52.649
That no one can take away.

35:52.651 --> 35:55.152
You can't be
a married woman,

35:55.154 --> 35:56.887
A mother and a madam.

35:56.889 --> 35:59.723
What kind of life is that
for our children?

36:01.259 --> 36:04.661
Please don't ask me to choose.

36:04.663 --> 36:06.530
I am.

36:06.532 --> 36:10.167
Between this life
and one with me.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.303
Between respectability,

36:13.305 --> 36:15.505
A family, a man who loves you...

36:15.507 --> 36:19.409
â™ª we grew cold

36:19.411 --> 36:21.211
â™ª I showed you stars...

36:21.213 --> 36:22.546
I can't give this up.

36:22.548 --> 36:24.714
â™ª I showed you night...

36:24.716 --> 36:26.416
I won't.

36:26.418 --> 36:29.653
Then you're giving up me.

36:29.655 --> 36:32.189
You do realize that?

36:32.191 --> 36:35.492
Say you'll marry me,
or we are over.

36:36.694 --> 36:39.362
â™ª we are such fools...

36:40.765 --> 36:43.700
I can't.

36:43.702 --> 36:46.469
I'm so sorry.

36:46.471 --> 36:49.706
â™ª we broke the rules

36:49.708 --> 36:52.576
â™ª the end of romance

36:53.511 --> 36:57.347
â™ª the end of romance

36:57.349 --> 37:02.385
â™ª you never think it'll come.

37:03.788 --> 37:04.854
Lady kenna.

37:04.856 --> 37:06.590
I know what I want.

37:06.592 --> 37:08.325
â™ª

37:08.327 --> 37:10.393
I think we'd be
good together,

37:10.395 --> 37:11.895
Perhaps have
a future.

37:11.897 --> 37:13.797
This is sudden.

37:13.799 --> 37:16.499
Not really. You've been flirting
with me since the day we met.

37:18.536 --> 37:20.704
You should know

37:20.706 --> 37:22.405
That if I choose to be with you,

37:22.407 --> 37:24.441
There are things in my past
that I can't change.

37:24.443 --> 37:25.709
You'll have to
accept them.

37:25.711 --> 37:26.977
If you prefer

37:26.979 --> 37:29.713
A demure flower
or a virginal maid,

37:29.715 --> 37:32.449
You're free to sign
a marriage contract

37:32.451 --> 37:35.252
To wed a noble's daughter
whom you've never met.

37:35.254 --> 37:36.653
Kenna, I agree.

37:38.589 --> 37:40.690
We may have

37:40.692 --> 37:42.425
A promising future.

37:42.427 --> 37:45.495
Then let's see
if we're good together.

37:47.698 --> 37:48.898
Is this a test?

37:48.900 --> 37:51.835
Impress me.

37:51.837 --> 37:54.604
â™ª

38:10.921 --> 38:13.790
I spoke with francis.

38:13.792 --> 38:16.826
I'm sorry, for what you're both
going through.

38:18.763 --> 38:21.498
Now that things are over
between you and condÃ©,

38:21.500 --> 38:23.366
You and francis
might...

38:25.336 --> 38:27.837
What I mean is,
you're both in pain.

38:27.839 --> 38:31.574
You might at least look
to comfort from each other.

38:31.576 --> 38:34.744
I don't think
that's likely right now.

38:34.746 --> 38:37.681
The truth is, I...

38:37.683 --> 38:40.717
Helped condÃ© try to get away.

38:40.719 --> 38:43.486
Francis thinks I made
that choice out of love,

38:43.488 --> 38:44.888
That I rejected him.

38:44.890 --> 38:46.856
He doesn't understand
how I could feel

38:46.858 --> 38:49.592
So responsible
for condÃ©'s suffering.

38:51.529 --> 38:53.330
You mean that you
encouraged the love

38:53.332 --> 38:54.831
Of a man below you in rank?

38:54.833 --> 38:57.767
Because he found
himself drawn

38:57.769 --> 38:59.703
Into political intrigues
he knew nothing about,

38:59.705 --> 39:01.871
With enemies he'd
never had before?

39:01.873 --> 39:03.640
Because he
found himself

39:03.642 --> 39:05.942
Doing things
he'd never contemplated,

39:05.944 --> 39:07.777
Getting in deeper and deeper.

39:07.779 --> 39:09.612
Oh, god, bash.

39:09.614 --> 39:11.581
Yes.

39:11.583 --> 39:14.117
I walked this road first.

39:18.055 --> 39:20.423
It's not just condÃ©.

39:21.826 --> 39:24.661
It's not one affair gone wrong.

39:24.663 --> 39:26.596
It's me.

39:26.598 --> 39:28.498
The queen of France.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.900
This will happen any time

39:30.902 --> 39:33.837
I look for love
or happiness.

39:33.839 --> 39:37.774
I'll condemn any man
who brings it to me.

39:37.776 --> 39:40.377
Only a king
could survive my love,

39:40.379 --> 39:42.779
And no one below.

39:42.781 --> 39:45.148
My rank is poison.

39:45.150 --> 39:48.451
I'm sorry.

39:51.088 --> 39:53.490
(sighs)

39:53.492 --> 39:56.993
Brave mary, I'm sorry.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.034
How many showed up?
Enough.

40:05.036 --> 40:07.704
Lords with holdings
all over France.

40:07.706 --> 40:10.173
Protestants,
ready to listen to you.

40:10.175 --> 40:12.175
You seem to have a lot of faith
they'll follow me

40:12.177 --> 40:14.010
After they listen.
You've been spending

40:14.012 --> 40:15.478
Most of your time at court.

40:15.480 --> 40:16.713
I don't think you're aware

40:16.715 --> 40:18.448
Of how unhappy
your brethren are.

40:22.586 --> 40:24.654
Francis.

40:26.690 --> 40:28.858
I know
I have hurt you.

40:28.860 --> 40:31.161
We have hurt
each other.

40:31.163 --> 40:32.829
But there is something
I've learned,

40:32.831 --> 40:34.898
And that is
we must put this behind us.

40:34.900 --> 40:39.569
We are king and queen,
chained together

40:39.571 --> 40:42.839
As surely as prisoners
in a dungeon.

40:42.841 --> 40:45.442
And if we are not
to suffer as prisoners do,

40:45.444 --> 40:47.076
We must make peace
with each other.

40:47.078 --> 40:50.980
It's our only chance
of survival in this life

40:50.982 --> 40:52.882
Without going mad
with grief.

40:52.884 --> 40:55.151
Do you think
you could ever forgive me?

40:57.087 --> 41:00.457
Please, if you are angry,
say something!

41:01.926 --> 41:03.927
Oh, you ask for forgiveness.

41:03.929 --> 41:06.763
How can I even
consider it

41:06.765 --> 41:08.698
When condÃ© is still out there,

41:08.700 --> 41:10.834
Most likely
with agents of elizabeth?

41:10.836 --> 41:14.838
<i>France has been through</i>
<i>so much.</i>

41:14.840 --> 41:18.174
<i>Most of this country</i>
<i>is like dry tinder,</i>

41:18.176 --> 41:20.610
Just waiting for a spark.
Laurent: <i>Prince condÃ©!</i>

41:20.612 --> 41:22.645
No longer
prince of condÃ©!

41:22.647 --> 41:24.481
King louis of France!

41:24.483 --> 41:26.483
(men cheering)

41:26.485 --> 41:29.486
Francis: <i>All that is needed</i>
<i>is a face, a claim,</i>

41:29.488 --> 41:30.954
A bloodline,

41:30.956 --> 41:32.989
And someone
who is willing

41:32.991 --> 41:34.724
To die for the cause.

41:34.726 --> 41:36.726
Men (chanting):
<i>Louis! Louis! Louis!</i>
