05:24.240 --> 05:25.753
Mommy!

05:28.720 --> 05:30.073
Bad dreams?

05:30.320 --> 05:33.869
- Mommy.
- All over, come on here.

05:34.880 --> 05:37.314
He's in my closet,
something's in my closet.

05:37.440 --> 05:41.194
Oh, too much junk food.
Too much of the tube, guys.

05:41.880 --> 05:43.359
He's in there.

05:43.480 --> 05:46.631
Tad, now there's nothing in this house
that's going to hurt you.

05:46.760 --> 05:48.034
Now, look what I see in the closet here.

05:48.160 --> 05:51.755
All right, I see clothing,
I see a pile of blankets on a chair,

05:51.880 --> 05:53.871
a lot of toys that weren't put away,

05:54.000 --> 05:57.913
and your favourite
over-the-hill teddy bear

05:58.040 --> 06:00.270
who would probably be a lot happier...

06:03.760 --> 06:06.877
Who would probably be a lot happier
in bed with you.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.230
And that's it, nothing else.

06:09.360 --> 06:12.557
I saw him, really. He's in the closet.

06:13.320 --> 06:17.074
He has yellow eyes,
and his mouth is about this long,

06:17.200 --> 06:20.476
and he has teeth
and they're curled like this,

06:20.600 --> 06:22.511
and he made sounds.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.358
What kind of sounds?

06:25.640 --> 06:27.358
What kind of sounds?

06:28.280 --> 06:31.158
Come on, try. What kind of sounds?
Like what?

06:35.800 --> 06:37.677
Yeah, that'd scare me pretty good.

06:37.800 --> 06:40.439
- Really.
- But he's all gone now, champ, see?

06:40.560 --> 06:42.551
He's in there, I saw him.

06:43.160 --> 06:44.354
Really.

06:44.480 --> 06:47.790
Tad, you saw him in your dreams,
in your head, nowhere else.

06:47.920 --> 06:49.273
See, Tad, there aren't any real...

06:49.400 --> 06:53.029
Tad, listen to me,
there's no such thing as real monsters.

06:53.160 --> 06:54.718
Only in stories.

06:54.840 --> 06:57.229
There's no real monsters, though.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.592
- Really?
- Really.

06:59.960 --> 07:01.109
Really.

07:02.640 --> 07:05.279
Okay, over, done with, gone, right?

07:05.400 --> 07:07.118
Over, done with, gone.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.352
Okay, snuggle in.

07:11.280 --> 07:14.716
Night, night, sleep tight,
don't let the bedbugs bite.

07:17.720 --> 07:20.075
You have good dreams, little man.

07:26.120 --> 07:28.395
There aren't any monsters, Tad.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.075
Except for the one in my closet.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.399
Please.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.678
Please, please.

08:14.520 --> 08:15.919
Hey, Tadder.

08:17.160 --> 08:19.196
You know, it looks like
someone was moving furniture around

08:19.320 --> 08:23.233
up in your bedroom last night?
Any idea on who that might have been?

08:23.600 --> 08:24.589
No.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.155
- Do you know, Donna?
- Wasn't me.

08:28.880 --> 08:30.552
Wasn't me, neither.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.073
Wasn't me.

08:33.960 --> 08:35.871
Yeah, come on in, Steve.

08:36.520 --> 08:37.748
Morning.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.431
- Mrs Trenton.
- Morning.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.558
Here you go, Tadpole.

08:43.679 --> 08:46.069
Just like I promised,
brought your horse back.

08:46.200 --> 08:49.158
- Looks pretty good stripped, doesn't it?
- Do we have a cheque for him?

08:49.280 --> 08:53.068
Listen, why don't you just wait
until I bring your table back?

08:54.000 --> 08:55.149
Thanks.

08:55.840 --> 08:58.798
Well, I can't stay
for a cup of coffee anyway.

08:59.280 --> 09:01.271
Sorry, would you like a cup?

09:01.400 --> 09:02.469
Just teasing.

09:02.600 --> 09:06.878
Hey, Tad, maybe it was Mr Kemp who
moved all your furniture around, huh?

09:07.000 --> 09:08.433
Okay.

09:08.560 --> 09:10.630
What did I do now, huh?

09:10.760 --> 09:13.752
- No, the monster did it.
- The monster?

09:13.880 --> 09:16.394
Oh, now come on,
remember what I said.

09:16.520 --> 09:19.159
"There aren't no such things
as monsters."

09:19.280 --> 09:21.840
There aren't any such things
as monsters.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.996
Not in the daytime anyway.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.714
Oh, come here, you.
"Not in the daytime."

09:27.840 --> 09:29.432
I'll show you what a monster can do
in the daytime.

09:29.560 --> 09:31.391
He grabs your knee...

09:32.560 --> 09:34.755
<i>- I know a lot about cereals...</i>
- Daddy, Daddy, look!

09:34.880 --> 09:37.678
<i>... because I'm the</i>
<i>Sharp Cereal Professor.</i>

09:38.160 --> 09:42.995
<i>Sharp Cereals, Twinkles, Coco-Bears,</i>
<i>Bran 16...</i>

09:43.120 --> 09:46.590
My daddy invented that.
He made him all up.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.035
Who?

09:48.240 --> 09:49.673
The Professor.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.910
<i>And they're good for you.</i>

09:52.600 --> 09:54.830
Well, your daddy's real smart, isn't he?

09:54.960 --> 09:57.155
As well as being
a hell of a tennis player.

09:57.280 --> 09:59.271
Ready for a rematch anytime you are.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.436
- Sure, sure.
- Tadpole.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.073
- Bye.
- Bye.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.394
Thanks.

10:07.360 --> 10:10.352
<i>No, nothing wrong here.</i>

10:15.120 --> 10:17.680
That's game, set, and match.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.119
- It was a good game.
- Oh, yeah.

10:19.240 --> 10:22.676
- What was the score, 6-0, 6-1?
- Yeah.

10:25.240 --> 10:27.879
- You're not getting tired of this, are you?
- What, are you kidding me?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.831
Getting my ass handed to me
every week? No, I love it.

10:29.960 --> 10:31.279
I'm a masochist.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.834
- Well, whatever turns you on.
- Yeah.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.794
No. Turn that off, please. It's dinner.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.073
Turn it off.

11:57.720 --> 12:01.759
This marriage is definitely
running out of conversation, isn't it?

12:08.400 --> 12:11.392
Maybe we should talk about
having another baby.

12:17.840 --> 12:19.114
I got you.

12:21.320 --> 12:24.551
Oh, no, he's got me. He's got me.

12:24.680 --> 12:26.238
Watch my chair!

12:46.640 --> 12:47.629
Hi.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.035
Excuse me.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.513
Listen, I have a problem
with my front wheel.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.232
I wonder if you could take a look at it.

12:53.360 --> 12:56.477
Park it next to the Datsun,
leave the keys in it.

12:57.520 --> 13:00.910
Well, I was kind of hoping
I could wait for it today.

13:03.640 --> 13:05.198
- You're kidding.
- No.

13:05.320 --> 13:07.754
- See you later, Harry.
- Yeah.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.755
Joe Camber will do it for you.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.153
What's that?

13:20.920 --> 13:22.194
Joe Camber.

13:22.480 --> 13:25.472
Do a real good job
and he won't rob you blind.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.672
Where's Joe Camber?

13:30.800 --> 13:34.679
You take 117 here, straight out of town,
6 miles, give or take.

13:34.800 --> 13:37.473
Go all the way out to the end,
you'll see Camber's mailbox.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.033
Can't miss it.

13:40.960 --> 13:42.109
Thanks.

13:45.240 --> 13:46.958
See you later, Harry.

14:27.960 --> 14:28.915
Hi.

14:31.480 --> 14:32.469
Pa!

14:44.720 --> 14:46.392
Tough time finding this place.
How are you?

14:46.520 --> 14:49.114
My name is Victor Trenton.
You're Mr Camber, right?

14:49.240 --> 14:50.309
Yeah.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.274
Afternoon.

15:08.280 --> 15:10.635
You folks want anything to drink?

15:11.600 --> 15:13.556
No, thank you. Thanks.

15:34.640 --> 15:35.675
Vic.

15:36.880 --> 15:39.155
Come on, Cujo. Come on, boy.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.838
Don't go over to that dog,
you don't know that dog.

15:42.960 --> 15:46.873
Don't worry about it, ma'am.
Cujo won't hurt him, he likes kids.

15:49.280 --> 15:50.235
He's safe.

15:50.360 --> 15:52.555
Run me down the hill and back,
wanna have a listen to it.

15:52.680 --> 15:54.591
- Yeah, okay.
- Vic.

15:54.760 --> 15:56.432
Oh, it's all right.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.073
Yeah, it's all right.

15:59.080 --> 16:02.356
Don't worry, Mr Trenton,
your boy will be all right.

16:15.560 --> 16:16.788
Gently.

16:17.080 --> 16:19.514
Cujo. His name's Cujo.

16:19.680 --> 16:22.956
- Cujo? How you doing, Cujo?
- He loves that.

16:23.880 --> 16:25.108
Hey, boy.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.117
What kind of dog is he?

16:27.240 --> 16:28.639
Saint Bernard.

16:28.760 --> 16:30.079
He's a great dog.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.794
Yeah, he's a pretty smart one, too.

16:37.440 --> 16:41.035
Monsters, stay out of Tad's room,
you have no business here.

16:42.320 --> 16:46.791
No monsters in Tad's closet,
it's too small for you in there. See?

16:48.440 --> 16:49.793
Where else?

16:50.080 --> 16:53.834
- Under the bed.
- Under the bed? Okay.

16:54.360 --> 16:55.509
All right.

16:55.640 --> 16:59.599
No monsters under Tad's bed,
you cannot fit under there.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.075
No monsters outside Tad's window.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.711
Can't hold on out there.

17:06.440 --> 17:08.157
Nothing will touch Tad,

17:08.480 --> 17:12.233
nothing will hurt Tad
all through this night.

17:12.560 --> 17:13.675
Okay?

17:16.079 --> 17:18.116
They have no business here.

17:23.119 --> 17:24.189
Okay?

17:35.920 --> 17:37.592
God, 1:30.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.715
What?

17:48.840 --> 17:51.752
You're just really good with him,
that's all.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.238
How am I with you?

17:55.520 --> 17:56.794
Wonderful.

17:59.640 --> 18:00.789
Night.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.553
<i>No, nothing wrong here.</i>

18:17.960 --> 18:20.269
<i>Well, that's not entirely true.</i>

18:20.400 --> 18:22.311
<i>This morning,</i>
<i>thousands of people across the country</i>

18:22.440 --> 18:25.750
<i>reported internal haemorrhaging</i>
<i>after eating Sharp Cereal products.</i>

18:25.880 --> 18:27.836
<i>The scare, however,</i>
<i>proved to be a false alarm.</i>

18:27.960 --> 18:29.359
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.038
- Hi, Tad.
- Hi, Dad.

18:31.160 --> 18:34.470
<i>Despite that fact, the scare has reached</i>
<i>alarming proportions.</i>

18:34.600 --> 18:37.558
<i>Sharp Cereal has been unavailable</i>
<i>for comment.</i>

18:38.160 --> 18:40.435
<i>Nope, nothing wrong here, folks.</i>

18:40.560 --> 18:41.629
Cute.

18:43.520 --> 18:45.511
That's our ad campaign.

18:45.640 --> 18:47.278
They've recalled
the whole goddamn cereal.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.516
- Then there's no harm done, is there?
- "No harm done"?

18:49.640 --> 18:51.596
Donna, that guy comes into
America's living room,

18:51.720 --> 18:53.312
and he says to kids, he says,
"Trust me."

18:53.440 --> 18:55.351
- Yes, I understand.
- No, I don't think you do.

18:55.480 --> 18:57.152
You see, we created that guy,
Roger and me.

18:57.280 --> 18:58.998
- He's our brainchild.
- Yes, I understand.

18:59.120 --> 19:01.395
And these kids,
they go out and they buy the cereal.

19:01.520 --> 19:03.431
All the Sharp Cereals. All of them.

19:03.600 --> 19:07.593
Bran 16, All Grain,
Coco-Bears, Twinkles.

19:07.720 --> 19:12.111
And now, kids all over the country
are peeing and puking red dye

19:12.240 --> 19:15.789
and scaring the hell out of their parents,
and we told them to buy it.

19:15.920 --> 19:19.629
The Sharp Professor is us.
That's our ass, Roger's and mine.

19:19.760 --> 19:21.876
You'll work it out,
you always have before.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.797
All right, look,
I appreciate this isn't a world crisis,

19:23.920 --> 19:26.514
- it's not a mass suicide...
- That'll be Roger.

19:26.640 --> 19:27.755
Hello?

19:27.880 --> 19:30.394
Yeah, sure, Roger, hold on. It's Roger.

19:30.520 --> 19:31.555
Calm down.

19:36.360 --> 19:37.509
Hi, Rog.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.835
Roger, Rog, calm down.

19:40.200 --> 19:43.476
Calm down, we'll work it out,
we always have before.

19:44.440 --> 19:45.998
Well, then, nobody got hurt, right?

19:46.120 --> 19:48.236
What we're talking about here
is a lot of scared people.

19:48.360 --> 19:50.351
<i>We're talking about recalling</i>
<i>the whole goddamn cereal.</i>

19:50.480 --> 19:53.552
Well, that's not too bad.
I mean, it certainly could be worse.

19:53.680 --> 19:56.911
Hey, buddy, don't yell at me,
I didn't do it, it's your dye not my...

19:57.040 --> 19:57.995
Roger.

19:58.120 --> 20:01.112
<i>...like there's nothing wrong here.</i>
- Look, look, no harm was done,

20:01.240 --> 20:04.437
and I'm sure given time,
this whole thing will blow over...

20:04.560 --> 20:06.949
<i>We're having a special board meeting</i>
<i>next week, okay?</i>

20:07.080 --> 20:08.035
Special board meeting?

20:08.160 --> 20:09.991
<i>To re-assess our position</i>
<i>re the Professor.</i>

20:10.120 --> 20:11.075
Sure, we can be there.

20:11.200 --> 20:12.553
<i>- You better be there.</i>
- Right.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.511
<i>You better start taking this</i>
<i>a little more seriously, too.</i>

20:14.640 --> 20:16.551
- Right.
<i>- I'm not kidding.</i>

20:18.040 --> 20:21.032
"To re-assess our position,
re the Professor."

20:23.160 --> 20:25.151
We lost the Sharp account.

20:32.280 --> 20:33.395
Brett!

21:37.400 --> 21:38.389
Hi.

21:39.360 --> 21:40.395
Hi.

21:40.840 --> 21:42.114
Come here.

21:43.320 --> 21:45.470
Can't see you anymore, Steve.

21:47.400 --> 21:50.233
Well, it's a little late for that, isn't it?

21:50.800 --> 21:52.995
Just came by to tell you that.

21:57.360 --> 22:00.272
Okay. Look, can you tell me why?

22:03.560 --> 22:04.515
Jesus, I don't know.

22:04.640 --> 22:06.790
I got this terrific husband
and this terrific kid

22:06.920 --> 22:09.718
and here I am screwing around
with the local stud.

22:09.840 --> 22:11.558
No offence intended.

22:11.680 --> 22:12.999
None taken.

22:13.520 --> 22:14.953
What the hell's the matter?

22:15.120 --> 22:17.918
It's just over, that's all. I want it over.

22:18.280 --> 22:22.558
It's not your fault.
It was just a stupid mistake.

22:25.960 --> 22:27.029
Okay.

22:27.840 --> 22:29.478
Whatever you want.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.794
I'm sorry.

24:04.240 --> 24:06.674
- Hi, pumpkin.
- Hi. Look what I made.

24:06.800 --> 24:09.394
Hey, that's really nice.

24:09.520 --> 24:11.715
What happened to you?

24:11.840 --> 24:15.389
- Nothing.
- Yeah? Doesn't look like nothing.

24:15.520 --> 24:17.795
I got hit by a swing.

24:18.360 --> 24:20.237
Come here, let me make it better.

24:23.120 --> 24:25.076
Well, over, done with, gone, right?

24:25.200 --> 24:26.315
Over, done with, gone.

24:26.440 --> 24:27.919
Okay, strap in.

24:42.400 --> 24:45.153
- Oh, you like this, huh?
- It's fun.

24:48.960 --> 24:50.552
<i>Bum, bum, bum</i>

24:50.680 --> 24:54.798
<i>- I see your hiney, nice and shiny</i>
<i>- Nice and shiny</i>

24:54.920 --> 24:58.549
<i>- lf you don't hide it, I think I'll bite it</i>
<i>- I think I'll bite it</i>

25:00.760 --> 25:03.672
- Daddy's home.
- Yeah, so I see.

25:05.320 --> 25:07.390
Okay, everybody out.

25:09.160 --> 25:10.752
- Hi.
- Daddy!

25:11.400 --> 25:12.753
My big guy.

25:14.120 --> 25:15.917
- Home early, huh?
- Yeah.

25:16.800 --> 25:19.360
- What happened to your head?
- Fell off the swing.

25:19.480 --> 25:21.232
- You did?
- Pinto's doing that thing again.

25:21.360 --> 25:22.918
I'll have to take it out to Camber's.
Let me see.

25:23.040 --> 25:24.632
- Yeah, I've heard that one before.
- Come here.

25:24.760 --> 25:26.318
Hey, would you like to play
some baseball?

25:26.440 --> 25:27.395
- Yeah.
- Would you?

25:27.520 --> 25:29.954
There's a load of groceries here, Tad,
that's your job.

25:30.880 --> 25:32.359
No, not today.

25:32.520 --> 25:35.512
Go on, go get your mitt,
you left it on the front lawn again.

25:35.640 --> 25:36.755
- Go on.
- Okay.

25:40.240 --> 25:42.117
So what'd you do today?

25:42.960 --> 25:47.476
Oh, you know, the usual.
Groceries, errands.

25:49.240 --> 25:50.309
Yeah?

25:50.840 --> 25:52.558
Roger come in today?

25:52.680 --> 25:55.478
No, he's still in mourning
for the account.

26:51.520 --> 26:53.351
What the hell is that?

26:53.480 --> 26:55.038
It's an engine hoist.

26:56.960 --> 27:00.430
You wanted one.
It's the new hydraulic hoist you wanted.

27:01.280 --> 27:03.077
You kept telling me you need one.

27:03.200 --> 27:05.509
You tell me
what the fuck you're up to, Charity.

27:05.640 --> 27:07.835
Sit down and eat, and I will.

27:08.640 --> 27:10.278
Can't you use it?

27:12.160 --> 27:14.151
Damn well can't afford it.

27:32.200 --> 27:33.838
I won the lottery.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.319
$5,000.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.038
When do we get it?

27:51.320 --> 27:53.276
Two weeks, a little less.

27:58.160 --> 27:59.309
Thanks.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.752
I got you a present.

28:03.800 --> 28:05.995
You give me one, Joe. Okay?

28:10.440 --> 28:13.591
I wanna go away for a week with Brett,

28:14.720 --> 28:16.995
to see my sister in Connecticut.

28:22.240 --> 28:26.279
Boston? What the hell
are you gonna do in Boston?

28:27.200 --> 28:29.873
What makes you think
I could afford to go, anyways?

28:30.720 --> 28:32.438
Shit, you're rolling in it!

28:32.680 --> 28:35.752
You might have to dig out something
from the mattress is all.

28:36.760 --> 28:39.228
You're kicking up your heels a little,
aren't you, Joey?

28:39.360 --> 28:42.397
You gonna go right to the Combat Zone,
see a couple of dirty movies

28:42.520 --> 28:43.589
and try to get the clap.

28:43.720 --> 28:46.917
You better look out, Pervier,
or I'll sic my dog on you.

28:47.680 --> 28:48.669
That dog?

28:48.800 --> 28:51.439
You couldn't sic that dog on me
if I was coming at you

28:51.560 --> 28:53.994
with a straight razor in each hand.

28:55.040 --> 28:57.076
What's your wife say about it?

28:57.200 --> 28:59.031
She don't know, she don't have to know.

28:59.160 --> 29:00.434
Oh, sure.

29:01.040 --> 29:04.032
She gonna take the boy and visit
her sister. Gonna be gone a week.

29:09.040 --> 29:12.191
You gonna spend a lump
of that lottery money, huh?

29:12.360 --> 29:16.239
- Oh, shit.
- Broads, booze, baseball!

29:16.680 --> 29:19.831
I don't want to do it alone,
it's no fun. Come on.

29:22.600 --> 29:24.716
I don't give a shit if I do.

29:26.440 --> 29:29.432
Okay, now you're talking.
Now you're talking!

30:04.320 --> 30:06.914
You got me, got me!
You got me, got me!

30:07.640 --> 30:08.709
How's my boy, huh?

30:08.840 --> 30:10.034
You having a good time
at summer camp?

30:10.160 --> 30:11.559
- No.
- No?

30:12.320 --> 30:14.754
Your mom said you were having fun.

30:16.240 --> 30:18.037
- Come on, you wanna go home, then?
- Yeah.

30:18.160 --> 30:20.720
All right, come on, let's go.
Over the shoulders.

30:20.840 --> 30:22.717
Yeah, home we go.

30:22.840 --> 30:24.796
Think you can beat me to the Jaguar?

30:24.920 --> 30:26.797
Think you can beat me? Come on.

31:01.080 --> 31:03.514
God, you scared the shit out of me.

31:03.640 --> 31:04.914
I'm sorry.

31:06.160 --> 31:07.912
How'd you get in here anyway?

31:08.120 --> 31:09.917
Finished with your table,
I brought it back.

31:10.040 --> 31:13.316
It's all stripped
and it's a beautiful piece of work.

31:13.440 --> 31:15.351
Leave it on the back porch.

31:15.480 --> 31:16.913
I already did.

31:18.160 --> 31:19.718
Where's Tadpole?

31:20.120 --> 31:22.031
He's upstairs sleeping.

31:25.880 --> 31:28.872
- Steve.
- I miss you, okay?

31:29.040 --> 31:31.395
- You know, I miss touching you.
- Steve...

31:31.720 --> 31:33.517
Please. Quit it!

31:41.600 --> 31:42.749
Steve.

31:50.360 --> 31:53.750
Home!
It's my goddamn home, you bastard!

31:53.880 --> 31:55.950
Bastard, it's my home!

31:57.000 --> 31:58.797
What the hell are you doing?

31:58.960 --> 32:01.030
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

32:01.160 --> 32:03.196
Just get out of here, Kemp.

32:04.920 --> 32:06.558
Mommy, Mommy!

32:08.440 --> 32:09.873
What happened?

32:10.120 --> 32:11.712
The milk spilled.

32:15.520 --> 32:17.317
- Go out and ride your bike, Tad.
- Are you okay, Mommy?

32:17.440 --> 32:18.429
- Go on.
- Yeah, honey, I'm okay.

32:18.560 --> 32:20.198
Go ride your bike.

32:22.120 --> 32:24.350
I brought your table, but I spilt some...

32:24.480 --> 32:25.595
Steve.

32:30.400 --> 32:31.515
Yeah.

32:42.720 --> 32:43.994
Yes or no?

32:49.640 --> 32:50.675
Yes.

33:23.840 --> 33:26.434
No, no! Don't, you son of a...

33:31.720 --> 33:33.073
What is it?

33:33.480 --> 33:35.232
I don't want you to go.

33:35.360 --> 33:38.318
Well, I'll be back.
I'll be back in 10 days.

33:39.920 --> 33:41.592
But I don't want to go to day camp.

33:41.720 --> 33:45.030
Why don't you give that
another day or two, all right?

33:45.480 --> 33:49.029
Who's gonna say the monster words?
Mommy don't know them.

33:56.480 --> 33:57.674
Come here.

34:04.600 --> 34:06.272
You see, Tad,

34:07.280 --> 34:10.875
the thing about the monster words
is they're written down.

34:11.400 --> 34:13.277
Yeah, that's the only way
your dad can know them.

34:13.400 --> 34:16.312
So, what I'll do is I'll copy them for you

34:16.440 --> 34:19.955
and I'll tack them on your bedroom wall
and that way...

34:20.080 --> 34:22.913
Well, your mom
can read them to you every night.

34:23.040 --> 34:24.234
Will you?

34:24.360 --> 34:27.351
I will. I promise I'll do it for you tonight.

34:29.960 --> 34:32.110
Okay, Tad, time for your nap.

34:33.679 --> 34:35.351
I love you, sport.

34:40.960 --> 34:42.473
Did you fix it?

34:43.000 --> 34:44.433
No, I don't have the tools.

34:44.560 --> 34:47.472
Take it up to Joe Camber's,
it's only 7 miles.

34:47.600 --> 34:48.998
Yeah, maybe.

34:49.400 --> 34:51.594
I'll try and run it up Saturday
if I can get the time.

34:51.719 --> 34:53.995
It's okay, I'll take care of it.

36:18.040 --> 36:19.598
Cujo?

36:42.800 --> 36:44.358
Cujo.

36:46.640 --> 36:48.596
Cujo, what's the matter?

36:51.160 --> 36:52.957
Cujo, it's me, Brett.

36:55.640 --> 36:57.312
Take it easy, boy.

36:59.200 --> 37:01.077
I'm not gonna hurt you.

37:04.600 --> 37:05.794
Cujo?

37:13.640 --> 37:14.868
Cujo!

37:16.680 --> 37:17.999
Cujo!

37:36.960 --> 37:40.157
I don't want you to go for 10 days.
I want you to go for one day.

37:40.280 --> 37:44.319
Tad, I'll be back before you know it.
Now give me a kiss, come on.

37:50.080 --> 37:52.799
I forgot to take the Pinto into Camber's.

37:54.600 --> 37:56.352
I'll take care of it.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.111
Well, I'll see you.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.718
Vic! Stay there.

38:24.640 --> 38:26.517
I just wanted you to know it was over.

38:26.640 --> 38:29.359
I just wanted to be sure
that you knew that.

38:30.400 --> 38:33.153
I can't make that it never happened, Vic.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.512
I can't make like
it never happened either, Donna.

38:35.640 --> 38:37.358
I know. I know that.

38:38.080 --> 38:40.799
So I don't know what I'm gonna do yet.

38:47.120 --> 38:48.519
I don't know.

39:09.040 --> 39:11.315
Get the rest of the bags, Brett.

39:21.880 --> 39:22.949
Mom?

39:23.960 --> 39:26.190
You know, I'm worried about Cujo.

39:26.320 --> 39:29.756
I saw him this morning in the fog
and he was all bloody.

39:29.920 --> 39:32.354
He was dripping foam at the mouth.

39:32.480 --> 39:34.232
I think I better tell Dad.

39:34.360 --> 39:36.351
No, you do no such thing.

39:36.640 --> 39:39.029
Your father would just
jump on something like that.

39:39.160 --> 39:41.355
You just leave him be and he'll come
mooching around your dad

39:41.480 --> 39:43.198
and your dad will take care of him.

39:43.600 --> 39:45.079
He loves Cujo.

39:45.200 --> 39:47.156
Yeah, I guess he would.

39:47.280 --> 39:50.397
Tell you what,
we'll call your father tonight.

39:50.960 --> 39:55.112
When you talk to him,
you say, sort of casually,

39:57.040 --> 39:59.190
"You feeding my dog, Daddy?"

40:00.120 --> 40:01.553
Then you know.

40:01.960 --> 40:03.393
- Yeah.
- Brett!

41:05.280 --> 41:06.429
Cujo.

41:07.760 --> 41:09.716
What're you growling at?

41:33.120 --> 41:36.590
Come on! Come on! I don't give a shit!

41:36.720 --> 41:39.439
You hear me? I don't give a shit!

41:48.120 --> 41:51.795
You are dead, you stupid son of a bitch.

42:47.240 --> 42:48.468
Cujo!

42:50.760 --> 42:51.829
Cujo!

42:57.720 --> 42:58.994
Cujo!

43:01.640 --> 43:02.755
Shit.

43:29.960 --> 43:31.075
Gary!

43:35.120 --> 43:36.439
Hey, Gary!

43:56.240 --> 43:57.355
Gary?

44:06.000 --> 44:07.149
Gary!

44:18.520 --> 44:21.080
Oh. Shit.

44:22.520 --> 44:23.919
Gary.

44:24.840 --> 44:26.034
Gary.

45:25.160 --> 45:26.275
Cujo!

45:29.360 --> 45:31.157
Oh, my God, you're rabid.

45:35.080 --> 45:37.230
Easy, boy. Easy, Cujo.

45:50.480 --> 45:53.711
<i>- One rolled over and the other one said</i>
<i>- One rolled over and the other one said</i>

45:53.840 --> 45:54.795
<i>Bum, bum, bum</i>

45:54.920 --> 45:59.072
<i>- I see your hiney, it's nice and shiny</i>
<i>- I see your hiney, it's nice and shiny</i>

45:59.200 --> 46:03.751
<i>- lf you don't hide it, I think I'll bite it</i>
<i>- lf you don't hide it, I think I'll bite it</i>

46:10.160 --> 46:13.835
<i>Oh, my goodness, oh, my soul!</i>

46:22.320 --> 46:25.869
Come on, baby. Just a little more to go.

47:03.520 --> 47:08.275
- Well, I think we've arrived, Tadder.
- Yeah, but is anybody home?

47:09.120 --> 47:11.076
I don't know, we'll see.

47:16.080 --> 47:17.229
Hello?

47:22.240 --> 47:24.754
- I can't get my seatbelt off.
- Hello?

47:29.920 --> 47:32.388
Just great. This is great.

47:36.160 --> 47:40.278
- I can't get my dang old seatbelt off.
- All right! I'm coming.

47:41.880 --> 47:43.791
You're so impatient.

47:44.960 --> 47:46.598
Damn belt is stuck again.

47:46.720 --> 47:49.598
I guess everything in this car is broken.

47:49.720 --> 47:52.234
I wish Daddy'd get a new car.

47:52.360 --> 47:53.998
Sounds good to me.

47:56.080 --> 47:57.559
Damn this car.

47:57.680 --> 47:59.477
You pull while I push.

48:02.400 --> 48:04.152
Oh, I can't get it.

48:04.280 --> 48:05.235
Pull!

48:43.320 --> 48:45.629
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Mommy!

48:52.800 --> 48:55.314
Oh, there's no monsters.

48:56.880 --> 48:58.313
I know, baby.

48:58.440 --> 49:01.079
It's the monster out of my closet!

49:01.200 --> 49:04.670
Listen to me, it's not a monster,
it's just a doggy.

49:28.160 --> 49:31.072
Okay, okay.

49:31.200 --> 49:32.155
I want to go home.

49:32.280 --> 49:33.952
The doggy's gone.
See, the doggy's gone.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.230
Okay, all right, we're gonna go home
right now.

49:37.880 --> 49:39.233
We're going right now.

49:43.360 --> 49:44.839
Damn this car!

49:48.120 --> 49:50.554
- I want to go home.
- Listen to me!

49:50.680 --> 49:53.513
- I want to go home.
- We can't go home right now, okay?

49:53.880 --> 49:55.598
We have to wait.

49:56.280 --> 49:58.874
Tad, we have to let... Okay.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.560
We have to let the engine die down.

50:02.960 --> 50:03.915
Okay.

50:06.440 --> 50:09.273
Okay, we're gonna go home
in a few minutes.

50:12.840 --> 50:15.229
We're gonna go home in a few minutes.

51:08.240 --> 51:10.037
Mom, aren't we going?

51:11.320 --> 51:12.275
Ma!

51:14.760 --> 51:16.671
Yeah, okay, we'll try it.

51:18.200 --> 51:19.872
Cross your fingers.

51:20.280 --> 51:22.350
Come on, baby, one more time.

51:28.240 --> 51:32.313
Great, it started! We're gonna go home.

51:44.040 --> 51:45.758
Fuck you, dog.

52:06.640 --> 52:08.631
Come on, damn it, turn over.

52:11.040 --> 52:13.508
Goddamn you, car!

52:15.000 --> 52:17.833
God, why didn't you get this car fixed?

52:19.280 --> 52:20.235
God!

52:25.120 --> 52:27.429
Mommy, are you okay?

52:30.880 --> 52:31.995
Yeah.

52:32.760 --> 52:34.955
I thought you were mad at me.

52:37.480 --> 52:39.357
No, baby, never at you.

52:45.560 --> 52:47.391
Can he get us in here?

52:51.680 --> 52:52.635
No.

52:54.560 --> 52:57.996
Can he eat his way in here? Can he?

52:59.080 --> 53:00.115
No.

53:02.160 --> 53:03.832
Wish he would die.

53:05.720 --> 53:06.948
Me, too.

54:18.240 --> 54:19.992
Mommy?

54:20.360 --> 54:23.318
- What?
- I gotta go pee.

54:23.760 --> 54:27.196
- Oh, Tadder, you got to go bad?
- Yes.

54:27.800 --> 54:29.074
Real bad?

54:32.280 --> 54:36.034
Okay, look, we're gonna open this door
just a little crack, okay?

54:36.160 --> 54:38.037
And you pee right outside here.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.319
Why can't we go outside?

54:42.440 --> 54:45.000
Because it's too cold.
Get your pants down.

54:45.120 --> 54:46.792
- Ready?
- Ready.

54:46.920 --> 54:48.751
Okay, go quick.

55:08.440 --> 55:10.192
Zip up your pants, Tad.

57:34.960 --> 57:39.033
- Don't open the window!
- Got to open a little bit for some air.

57:44.160 --> 57:45.593
What's that?

57:45.720 --> 57:47.233
The monster words.

57:47.360 --> 57:49.954
Oh, let me see. Please?

57:50.600 --> 57:52.556
I'll give them right back.

57:54.000 --> 57:57.072
- Something to drink.
- Oh, baby.

57:58.320 --> 58:01.630
We got just a little bit left
and I think we ought to save it, okay?

58:01.760 --> 58:03.671
Can you wait just for a while?

58:03.800 --> 58:05.836
- Yeah.
- Good, thank you.

58:07.720 --> 58:10.109
Can I have my monster words back?

58:12.920 --> 58:17.471
"Monsters stay out of Tad's room.
You have no business here.

58:17.920 --> 58:22.471
"No monsters under Tad's bed,
you can't fit under there.

58:23.280 --> 58:28.195
"No monsters hiding in Tad's closet,
it's too small in there.

58:28.760 --> 58:31.911
"No monsters outside Tad's window,

58:32.040 --> 58:34.952
"you can't hold on out there.

58:35.240 --> 58:39.233
"No vampires, no werewolves,
nothing that bites.

58:39.360 --> 58:42.477
"You have no business here."

58:43.960 --> 58:46.235
Maybe it'll start now.

58:47.160 --> 58:50.436
I'm afraid to try it because
the battery's so weak.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.514
What does it matter
if the battery's weak or not?

58:54.640 --> 58:56.392
We're just sitting here.

58:56.520 --> 58:57.714
Try it.

58:58.760 --> 58:59.988
Please.

59:01.640 --> 59:02.709
Okay.

59:17.240 --> 59:18.468
Told you.

59:22.880 --> 59:26.236
Don't worry, when the mailman comes
we'll go home.

59:36.880 --> 59:39.394
- Just lay them out like this.
- Okay.

59:42.280 --> 59:43.952
- George.
- Yeah.

59:45.520 --> 59:49.832
Hold mail until notified, the Cambers,
remember, George?

59:49.960 --> 59:51.757
My mind's gone.

59:51.880 --> 59:54.235
Thanks, Roger. Saved me a trip.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.955
Get back in that barn, damn you.

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:51.639
Oh, my God.

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:29.031
It makes him angry.

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:52.154
Come on. Please be quiet.

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:02.189
I want to go home. I want to go home.

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:04.959
Momma wants to go home
very much, too.

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:09.073
Can we please go home?

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.428
Oh, baby.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:16.237
<i>No, nothing wrong here.</i>

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.958
<i>- No, nothing wrong here.</i>
- This is ridiculous.

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:30.795
We need a whole new campaign.
Start from scratch, huh, Vic?

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:34.830
- Vic?
- Huh, what? I'm sorry.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.428
Cut it, Frank. We're wasting our time.

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:40.954
- Where you going?
- I need some sugar.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.155
Tadder?

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:01.669
Tad?

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.469
Oh, shit.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.950
Mommy, Mommy.

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:04.639
Mommy, please!

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:07.479
Mommy!

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:11.080
- I want to go home.
- Okay, baby.

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:14.956
Real soon.

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:18.868
Real soon, dear. Tadder, real soon.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.911
I want to go home.

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:23.679
Don't get out of the car.

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:42.314
No!

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:55.755
- Do you have any idea what time it is?
- Just wanted you to know, Roger.

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:58.189
- I have to go back.
- Go back? Go home?

01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.912
You can't do that.
This whole damn thing was your idea.

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:02.429
- You can't do that to me.
- I know, Roger. I'm sorry.

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.755
- But I can't stay.
- Oh, look, I understand.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.757
I know what you're going through.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.632
- You do?
- Of course.

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:10.438
You think I'm so wrapped up
in my own problems,

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:13.313
I can't see what's happening to you.
I see it, believe me.

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:15.670
- Happens to everyone.
- Not to me, it doesn't.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.995
Oh, you can't come up with an answer
to the Sharp account

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:21.270
so you think you're through,
you think the creative juice is gone.

01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:24.118
It's panic, that's all. Just panic.

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:31.868
Hey, what did I say?
Vic, what is eating you?

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:36.991
Donna's been having an affair.

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:41.558
Before I left she told me she had quit it.

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:44.671
But, Roger, she hasn't
answered the phone in two days.

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:46.198
Oh, shit.

01:08:46.399 --> 01:08:48.118
I'm going back.

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.038
I'm sorry.

01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:53.795
Look, maybe she's spending
the night with a friend.

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:56.434
Oh, I can't believe I said that.
Call someone.

01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.470
Call the police,
have them go over and take a look.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.430
That's not the point.

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:03.916
God damn it, Vic,
you can't run out on the Sharp account.

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.639
Wanna bet?

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.309
Please, God, get me out of here.

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.196
Please get me out of here.

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:55.189
Tad.

01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.473
Tadder, wake up.

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:02.669
Tad.

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:08.157
Tad! Tad!

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:10.795
Tad!

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:12.359
Oh, my God.

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:14.193
Tad, wake up.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:18.352
Oh, come on.

01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:28.190
Breathe, breathe.

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:30.915
Tad.

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.751
Come on, breathe. Breathe.

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:40.916
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:41.995
Come on.

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:45.474
Tadder, talk to me.

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:47.397
I want to go home.

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.314
- Tadder, talk.
- I want to go home.

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:52.829
<i>Four little monkeys sitting on a bed</i>

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.916
<i>- One rolled over</i>
<i>- One rolled over</i>

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:57.429
<i>- and the other one said</i>
<i>- Bum, bum, bum</i>

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:00.438
<i>I see your hiney, nice and shiny</i>

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:04.632
<i>If you don't hide it, I think I'll bite it</i>

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:06.235
Okay.

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:23.393
Anybody home?

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:30.949
Donna?

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:54.754
Donna?

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:33.636
We got to everybody on that list,
didn't we, Bannerman?

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:36.354
Did we ever reach Mrs...
What was her name?

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:39.790
- Her friend in Werdon?
- I said yes.

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:44.277
Man, I'm telling you, it was Kemp.
All right? This was Kemp who did this.

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:48.435
- Where's your wife's car, Mr Trenton?
- The what?

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.039
It bothers me. Kemp came here, right?
He grabs your wife and son.

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:56.914
Why? Well, he's crazy,
which is reason enough.

01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:58.912
Where's her car?

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:01.554
It's in the shop at Camber's.
The needle valve is sticking.

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:03.352
- Joe Camber's?
- Yes, Joe Camber's.

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:05.391
- She was going to take it in.
- When would that have been?

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:07.875
- I don't know.
- I'll check it out.

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:12.796
Wait, what are you going
to do about Kemp?

01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:15.832
We've got an MV alert out on him,
we'll pick him up soon enough.

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:17.757
Kemp is taken care of.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.433
Goddamn you!

01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:57.755
No!

01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:19.359
Oh, Tad. Oh, not now!

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:23.639
Oh, please, not now.
Oh, please, please.

01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:27.314
Breathe!

01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:28.913
Not now!

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:30.994
I want...

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:34.275
- I want my daddy.
- Okay.

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.436
Okay. I'll get your daddy.

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:38.198
Oh, my God.

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.197
I want my daddy.

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:44.039
I want my daddy.

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:48.800
I want my daddy.

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:53.234
- I want my daddy.
- All right, I'll get your daddy!

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:15.589
Mr Trenton?

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:18.273
We picked up Kemp.

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:20.428
Are they all right?

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.596
Well, your wife and son
weren't with him.

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:25.154
He claims that he never even saw them.

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:27.396
Bullshit! Now you don't
believe that, do you?

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:29.670
Not after what he did to the house.

01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:32.758
Now, that's the thing.
He admits that he trashed the house.

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:34.757
His story checks.

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:37.474
To tell you the truth, I believe him.

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:42.591
What did Bannerman say?

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:44.039
Well, he...

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:49.871
Probably following up some lead,
we'll be hearing from him any time now.

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:53.029
Wait a minute,
you haven't heard from him yet?

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:55.196
He hasn't even called in?

01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:54.435
Tad?

01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:57.599
Tad, baby.

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:01.115
Tad.

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:04.078
Oh, baby, wake up.

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:11.115
Tadder?

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:14.509
Tad?

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.830
Dear, God, gotta save my baby.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.911
Gotta save my baby.

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:20.996
Well, come on, then!

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:45.995
Tadder?

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:02.035
Tad?

01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:25.909
Tad?

01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:28.274
Breathe!

01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:50.674
Yes.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.513
Yes, baby.

01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:55.279
Yes, yes.

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:58.153
Yes, my baby.

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:01.795
Yes.

01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:04.075
Yes.

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:09.152
Yes, baby, yes.

01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:49.549
Donna?

01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:54.789
Donna?

01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:56.995
Donna!
