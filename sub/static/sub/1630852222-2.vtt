00:24.560 --> 00:27.520
'It's just - I need you to...

00:27.560 --> 00:30.720
promise me something, Tabitha erm...

00:31.520 --> 00:34.760
You see, I've...
I've done something rather silly.

00:34.800 --> 00:37.640
And it might sound bad -
might sound very bad even -

00:37.680 --> 00:40.120
but it's not what it seems.

00:40.160 --> 00:42.000
Not at all.
It's not what it seems

00:42.040 --> 00:45.920
and um...just needs a little bit
of clearing up, that's all, so...

00:45.960 --> 00:48.520
That's why I need you to promise me.

00:48.560 --> 00:53.960
I need you to promise me
that you won't tell the police.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.560
There you go.
Can you promise me that, Tabitha?

00:56.600 --> 00:58.680
Er, because I can't...

01:00.160 --> 01:05.680
I can't let Susan down.
Do you understand?

01:07.040 --> 01:09.760
She's very, er, fragile. Yeah.'

01:30.000 --> 01:32.440
'(VEHICLE ENGINE REVVING)'

01:54.520 --> 01:56.800
'Dear Chris...

01:56.840 --> 01:59.320
I've managed to get hold
of a pen and some paper

01:59.360 --> 02:01.640
and so I thought
I'd write you a letter.

02:02.680 --> 02:05.400
There's so much
I want to say to you, Chris,

02:05.440 --> 02:07.880
and maybe, one day,
we'll see each other again

02:07.920 --> 02:10.000
and I'll be able to do it.

02:11.520 --> 02:14.200
Perhaps a little better
than I feel able to now.

02:17.040 --> 02:20.520
You see, I never cared about being
shut out from the real world...

02:23.080 --> 02:27.200
..because I never felt like
I was allowed to arrive here
in the first place.

02:28.760 --> 02:31.040
I'm not here, anyway, am I?

02:31.080 --> 02:32.680
So, what's the difference?

02:32.720 --> 02:37.160
What's the difference between here
and somewhere else in my head?

02:38.520 --> 02:42.520
But I see it now.
That it was different for you.

02:42.560 --> 02:45.760
You had a place in that world...
and then you met me.

02:47.480 --> 02:50.720
So, I just wanted to say
that I understand.

02:50.760 --> 02:55.200
I will love you always...
but I understand.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.680
Yours, Susan.'

04:03.800 --> 04:05.960
Wait there.
I'll be back in minute.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.520
What? Chris. Where are you going?
I'll be back before you know it.
Just hold tight.

05:06.920 --> 05:10.520
..and buried them in
the rear garden of their own house.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.920
They then set about concealing
both the deaths and the burials

05:13.960 --> 05:15.680
for the next 15 years.

05:16.720 --> 05:20.200
But the story that Susan
and Christopher have concocted

05:20.240 --> 05:22.040
is a fantasy.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.360
It is not the truth.

05:24.400 --> 05:28.560
Over the course of this trial,
we will demonstrate
that Susan and Christopher Edwards

05:28.600 --> 05:32.840
are not only audacious
and unrepentant liars,

05:32.880 --> 05:37.120
they are cold-blooded killers
who, with forethought and malice,

05:37.160 --> 05:40.800
jointly agreed to murder
and conceal the bodies

05:40.840 --> 05:44.240
of the helpless Patricia
and William Wycherley.

06:12.120 --> 06:14.120
Thank you.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.440
Good morning, officers.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.240
My step-son left this letter
on my porch early this morning.

07:44.920 --> 07:47.880
'Decomposition begins
almost immediately...

07:47.920 --> 07:51.720
and after three or four days
in a warm environment, the corpse

07:51.760 --> 07:57.000
enters a new phase of decay which we
refer to as putrefaction or bloat.'

07:57.040 --> 08:01.160
The microorganisms
digesting body tissue produce gases

08:01.200 --> 08:05.560
which cause the body to swell -
most visibly in the face,

08:05.600 --> 08:08.880
where the eyes and tongue are pushed
forward, often quite grotesquely.

08:08.920 --> 08:11.120
And these gases
are extremely foul-smelling.

08:11.160 --> 08:14.280
We've all had the misfortune
of smelling "off" chicken.

08:14.320 --> 08:18.200
Now imagine two chickens,
each the size of a human body.

08:18.240 --> 08:22.400
'In many cases,
it induces nausea and vomiting.'

08:22.440 --> 08:24.320
So what are the chances,
would you say,

08:24.360 --> 08:27.560
of Christopher and Susan Edwards
entering a tiny house,

08:27.600 --> 08:30.400
where two adult corpses had lain
for nearly a week

08:30.440 --> 08:33.760
in temperatures
of up to 23 degrees Celsius,

08:33.800 --> 08:36.360
and not immediately smelling them?

08:36.400 --> 08:37.800
Nil.

08:45.880 --> 08:47.880
Yah!

09:10.720 --> 09:13.320
Dr Dickson,
in the Edwards' interviews,

09:13.360 --> 09:17.760
they repeatedly stated
that William Wycherley's limbs
and torso were "stiff".

09:17.800 --> 09:20.160
What would account for that?
Rigor mortis.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.320
Biochemical changes in a dead body

09:22.360 --> 09:25.240
that lead to a stiffening
of the muscles.

09:25.280 --> 09:27.920
Is rigor mortis permanent?

09:27.960 --> 09:31.760
No. Without refrigeration,
it dissipates

09:31.800 --> 09:34.320
approximately three days
after death.

09:34.360 --> 09:36.880
So, could William Wycherley's body
have been stiff

09:36.920 --> 09:38.960
six days after he was killed?

09:39.000 --> 09:40.760
It is highly improbable.

09:40.800 --> 09:44.120
Yet, both Chris and Susan
contend that it was stiff

09:44.160 --> 09:45.880
when they buried it.

09:45.920 --> 09:48.120
Their timescale must be mistaken.

09:48.160 --> 09:51.280
They must have buried William
within three days of death.

09:51.320 --> 09:54.560
When Mr Edwards maintains
he was still in London?

09:54.600 --> 09:56.480
Yes.

10:35.040 --> 10:36.760
Here.

10:39.240 --> 10:41.000
Whoa. Whoa.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.520
With a double-action revolver
like this...

10:54.560 --> 10:58.040
the trigger action has two phases.

10:58.880 --> 11:03.080
The first part of your squeeze,
which takes quite a bit of effort.

11:03.120 --> 11:06.040
I think you can see
the strain on my finger.

11:06.080 --> 11:08.760
What's happening
is the hammer is being pulled back

11:08.800 --> 11:11.240
into firing position
and, at the same time,

11:11.280 --> 11:15.000
the cylinder is advancing
a fresh bullet into the chamber.

11:15.040 --> 11:20.400
Requires quite a deliberate effort
to discharge every bullet.

11:20.440 --> 11:23.880
So not the kind of trigger that you
could pull by mistake, then?

11:23.920 --> 11:26.120
'Not easily, no.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.440
It's a gun. It's not a toy.'

11:36.640 --> 11:38.560
'And the other thing
to consider here

11:38.600 --> 11:41.840
is that the bullet strikes
on the bones

11:41.880 --> 11:45.760
are also extremely similar
in both victims...

11:45.800 --> 11:48.440
and suggests
they were facing the gun.'

11:48.480 --> 11:52.080
'What would your overall conclusion
be, taking all that into account?'

11:52.120 --> 11:55.520
My working assumption would be
that the same shooter

11:55.560 --> 11:58.200
discharged all four bullets,

11:58.240 --> 12:02.040
which is to say
that both William and Patricia

12:02.080 --> 12:04.560
were most likely killed
by the same person,

12:04.600 --> 12:08.760
and that he or she was probably
familiar with this sort of weapon.

12:08.800 --> 12:12.680
It's not like this is
the biggest gun in the world
but it's still quite serious.

12:12.720 --> 12:15.560
Do you know what I mean?
No further questions, My Lady.

13:00.960 --> 13:05.520
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I shall give...

13:06.400 --> 13:10.720
..shall be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth.

13:16.680 --> 13:20.600
What sort of films
did Gary Cooper star in, Mr Edwards?

13:20.640 --> 13:22.760
He was a Hollywood actor
in the '40s and '50s,

13:22.800 --> 13:24.840
is that correct?
And '60s, yes.

13:24.880 --> 13:27.680
And '60s.
Yes, thank you for clarifying.

13:27.720 --> 13:30.600
He was, er,
principally known for Westerns.

13:30.640 --> 13:33.200
But he played a wide range
of characters -

13:33.240 --> 13:36.080
romantic leads, comedies, soldiers.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.600
And, er, of course,

13:37.640 --> 13:41.600
he once played baseball player
Lou Gehrig in Pride Of The Yankees.

13:41.640 --> 13:43.280
But isn't it true, Chris,

13:43.320 --> 13:47.080
that you and your wife
loved stories about the Wild West?

13:47.120 --> 13:49.800
About gunslingers and outlaws?

13:49.840 --> 13:52.520
Well, Susan was the Gary Cooper fan.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.600
And it was all perfectly harmless.

13:54.640 --> 13:59.360
Members of the jury,
please refer to document EL-96.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.440
This is an invoice from 2009,

14:01.480 --> 14:06.200
for an authenticated
Gary Cooper letter costing £2,700.

14:06.240 --> 14:10.480
You spent £2,700
on a Gary Cooper letter

14:10.520 --> 14:12.880
despite being
on the verge of bankruptcy?

14:12.920 --> 14:14.560
It was a gift for Susan.

14:14.600 --> 14:17.080
And we were not
on the verge of bankruptcy.

14:17.120 --> 14:19.600
Mr Edwards, when you and your wife

14:19.640 --> 14:21.720
were arrested
on your return from France,

14:21.760 --> 14:24.960
you had nothing
but a few coins between you.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.840
The only personal belongings you had
were a few signed photos and books.

14:29.880 --> 14:35.360
You personally have a correspondence
with the actor Gerard Depardieu.

14:35.400 --> 14:39.720
So, it is preposterous to suggest
that you were not a participant

14:39.760 --> 14:44.040
in this world of overblown heroes
and Hollywood stars and guns.

14:44.080 --> 14:46.640
If you wanna get into the detail -
Listen to my question -

14:46.680 --> 14:49.320
Well, now you're
interrupting my answer.

14:50.560 --> 14:53.960
You owned a gun of the same calibre

14:54.000 --> 14:56.760
as the one that shot your in-laws,
didn't you?

14:56.800 --> 14:59.680
At one time I owned a revolver
that was capable of taking

14:59.720 --> 15:02.120
.38-calibre cartridges, yes.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.240
You had .38-calibre cartridges.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.760
Not in May 1998, I didn't.

15:06.800 --> 15:11.200
I had neither cartridges
nor firearms. I had sold them.

15:11.240 --> 15:14.440
Your wife hates guns, doesn't she?

15:14.480 --> 15:16.480
She certainly doesn't like them.

15:17.360 --> 15:20.880
You told the police
she was terrified of them.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.880
That she wouldn't even touch one
at the firing range.

15:23.920 --> 15:27.640
That's correct.
She's generally very fragile.

15:27.680 --> 15:29.640
Another thing we haven't spent -

15:29.680 --> 15:31.480
What about you, Chris?

15:31.520 --> 15:33.560
You like guns, don't you?

15:35.000 --> 15:36.600
I'm interested in guns.

15:36.640 --> 15:40.400
I am interested in military history
and guns are simply a part of that.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.280
Chris, could we just clarify
something for the jury?

15:43.320 --> 15:46.600
You used to fire such weapons,
didn't you? Quite often?

15:46.640 --> 15:48.960
Not often, no, because the er...

15:49.000 --> 15:52.080
the club where I did my shooting
was in Earl's Court.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.520
So, from Dagenham,
I had to change trains twice,

15:54.560 --> 15:56.960
so by the time I got home,
it was very late.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.760
And then after Susan moved in,
it started to feel like I...

15:59.800 --> 16:02.160
Well, it wasn't worth it any more,
so I sold the guns

16:02.200 --> 16:04.440
and surrendered
my firearms certificate

16:04.480 --> 16:06.960
and that was in September 1995.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.400
But before you lived with Susan, you
would've happily made the journey?

16:11.440 --> 16:13.400
Yes.
So, what changed?

16:14.240 --> 16:18.120
Susan didn't like me being away
from home for too long
unless it was for work.

16:18.160 --> 16:22.200
Or she didn't like me being away
from HER, perhaps I should say.

16:22.240 --> 16:25.000
But you enjoyed this hobby,
didn't you?

16:26.120 --> 16:28.120
Yes.

16:28.160 --> 16:30.280
Did you feel like it was your choice

16:30.320 --> 16:34.240
to stop making that journey,
or did Susan make you do it?

16:34.280 --> 16:36.840
Um... It was... It was mutual.

16:37.720 --> 16:41.240
And when you buried the bodies,
was that your choice?

16:41.280 --> 16:43.640
Or did Susan make you do it?

16:44.680 --> 16:47.400
It was erm...
Was it mutual?

16:49.040 --> 16:50.680
Yes.

16:50.720 --> 16:53.080
And when you phoned your step-mother

16:53.120 --> 16:55.400
to tell her
about the bodies in the garden,

16:55.440 --> 16:57.920
that was YOUR choice, wasn't it?

16:57.960 --> 17:02.120
That was a choice you made
independently without Susan.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.680
And that is why
we are all here today, isn't it?

17:04.720 --> 17:08.400
You must have been in a great deal
of pain and discomfort

17:08.440 --> 17:12.920
to choose this over what you
could've had in France, with Susan.

17:20.600 --> 17:25.760
I made a choice to marry Susan
because I loved her...

17:27.440 --> 17:31.040
..and since then I've been living
Susan's life with her.

17:35.280 --> 17:38.880
My life didn't really come into it.
It wasn't important any more.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.280
Chris.

17:52.320 --> 17:54.200
Huh?

17:58.560 --> 18:02.520
'Would you be able to show us,
Chris, how to fire a gun?

18:02.560 --> 18:04.840
A .38, for example?'

18:04.880 --> 18:07.560
Well, there are many styles.

18:07.600 --> 18:11.480
My training was in something called
"precision target shooting".

18:11.520 --> 18:14.280
You begin with a pistol
in front of you, unloaded.

18:14.320 --> 18:19.000
And let's say the target is erm...
well, where My Ladyship is.

18:20.280 --> 18:23.200
And you take your position,
bringing up the hand

18:23.240 --> 18:25.880
to make sure you're pointing
naturally in that direction.

18:25.920 --> 18:28.760
Take out the pistol,
fit it to the hand very precisely

18:28.800 --> 18:31.160
cos you need to get
a consistency of grip.

18:31.200 --> 18:35.680
In the case of a revolver,
you put the cartridges into it
and then close it.

18:35.720 --> 18:40.040
Take a couple of gentle,
deep breaths.

18:43.320 --> 18:46.720
And then raise...the pistol.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.200
Breathe out...

18:52.640 --> 18:54.640
..both eyes open.

18:58.560 --> 19:01.600
And what you're looking for...

19:01.640 --> 19:04.720
is something they call
the "surprise break"...

19:05.840 --> 19:09.640
..which is when the shot goes off
without you even thinking about it.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.240
Here, take this.
What do I do with it?

19:32.280 --> 19:34.680
Aargh!
Move forward!

19:36.320 --> 19:38.880
Just run, Susan! Go!
No!

19:42.080 --> 19:45.200
I'll take care of this. Just go now!
No! Not without you.

19:46.480 --> 19:48.560
Susan, I'm begging you!

19:48.600 --> 19:50.920
Just do it!
No! Not without you!

19:50.960 --> 19:52.960
I'll find you.

19:54.080 --> 19:56.920
Susan, I'm begging you. Just run!
I'll be all right.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.800
How did they know we'd be here?

20:04.080 --> 20:06.120
Chris? How did they know?

20:07.160 --> 20:08.840
Susan...

20:15.920 --> 20:19.200
Susan! What are you doing?

20:28.080 --> 20:29.560
Aargh!

20:35.680 --> 20:37.640
Aargh!

20:42.280 --> 20:43.600
Aargh!

22:13.320 --> 22:15.960
'Would you mind speaking up,
please, Mrs Edwards.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.480
It's quite hard to hear
what you're saying.'

22:18.520 --> 22:21.240
'I can't remember clearly, erm...

22:22.400 --> 22:24.040
She had just killed my father,

22:24.080 --> 22:26.360
and she was saying
those dreadful things to me,

22:26.400 --> 22:28.120
and at some point I just...'

22:28.160 --> 22:30.680
'You pulled the trigger?'
'Yes.'

22:30.720 --> 22:34.160
Louder, please, Mrs Edwards.
Yes, I pulled the trigger.

22:34.200 --> 22:37.320
But as we heard from our expert,
such an action would have required

22:37.360 --> 22:42.360
two separate applications of force,
not hair trigger, but deliberate.

22:42.400 --> 22:46.880
Enough to cock it and fire the gun.
Twice. Bang-bang.

22:46.920 --> 22:48.520
You did that?

22:50.240 --> 22:52.200
I... I don't know
exactly how I did it.

22:52.240 --> 22:54.680
I've spent 16 years
trying to forget what happened.

22:54.720 --> 22:56.040
All I know is I was provoked.

22:56.080 --> 22:58.920
Did you even look to see
if you could help your father

22:58.960 --> 23:00.480
when you saw he'd been shot?

23:00.520 --> 23:02.560
No, I didn't
want to look at my father.

23:02.600 --> 23:04.480
It... It was frightening.

23:04.520 --> 23:08.880
Perhaps you might be able to tell me
a little about the brass casings

23:08.920 --> 23:11.040
that you told the police
you saw on the floor

23:11.080 --> 23:13.360
and that you disposed of
with the gun.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.640
Erm...there were casings.

23:16.680 --> 23:19.800
Erm blastings. I...
I don't know, I saw them.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.560
And what did you do with the gun?
To dispose of it?

23:23.600 --> 23:27.240
I wrapped it up
along with the casings that I...

23:27.280 --> 23:28.840
that were on the floor,

23:28.880 --> 23:31.840
and I put it in a bag, and then
I took it into town and I...

23:31.880 --> 23:33.480
put it in an empty rubbish bin

23:33.520 --> 23:35.920
so that other things
would be put on top.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.920
A rubbish bin?
In the middle of the street?

23:38.960 --> 23:41.360
Yeah, it was the Tuesday
after bank holiday.

23:41.400 --> 23:44.400
Then you went directly
from the rubbish bin to the bank,

23:44.440 --> 23:47.080
which we've already discussed.
Where did you go after the bank?

23:47.120 --> 23:49.000
I returned to the house

23:49.040 --> 23:51.320
after buying some air fresheners.

23:51.360 --> 23:53.320
Oh, you bought air fresheners?

23:53.360 --> 23:55.400
Yes, about 20 of them.

23:55.440 --> 23:58.120
Cos I...I thought the bodies
might start to smell

23:58.160 --> 24:00.880
and...and the house already stank
of smoke and nicotine,

24:00.920 --> 24:02.440
and I hated that smell.

24:02.480 --> 24:05.640
You've never mentioned
the air fresheners to the police

24:05.680 --> 24:09.040
and yet after Dr Dickson's
very vivid description

24:09.080 --> 24:12.640
of how a body decomposes,
suddenly you bought 20 of them.

24:12.680 --> 24:15.920
I did... I forgot.
I didn't think it was important.

24:15.960 --> 24:17.960
Did you know, Mrs Edwards,

24:18.000 --> 24:21.480
that a revolver of this type
does not discharge casings?

24:24.280 --> 24:26.240
Did you know that?
No.

24:26.280 --> 24:28.960
Could you speak up please,
Mrs Edwards, so we can all hear you?

24:29.000 --> 24:30.920
Sorry. No.
You didn't know.

24:31.600 --> 24:34.120
But if you had fired the gun,
you would've seen

24:34.160 --> 24:35.960
it produced no casings,
wouldn't you,

24:36.000 --> 24:37.840
and you wouldn't have made them up.

24:37.880 --> 24:41.440
Isn't it a pity
that you didn't go over that detail
with your husband before the arrest?

24:41.480 --> 24:43.720
No, they... I saw them.

24:43.760 --> 24:47.320
They would not have become
part of your story, would they?

24:47.360 --> 24:50.080
No, they were there.
They were there on the floor.

24:50.120 --> 24:52.880
And can you tell me why you wrapped
your parents' bodies

24:52.920 --> 24:55.080
in duvet covers, Mrs Edwards?

24:55.800 --> 24:57.960
To hide them,
to make it as if it hadn't happened.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.360
Cos I didn't want to see them.
I didn't want to look at them.

25:01.400 --> 25:05.400
Is that also why you destroyed
the photographs, the letters,

25:05.440 --> 25:08.160
the diaries, that you burned
outside your apartment in France,

25:08.200 --> 25:09.840
as we heard from the defence?

25:09.880 --> 25:12.560
The intention there
isn't to preserve

25:12.600 --> 25:15.280
the memory of your parents, is it?

25:15.320 --> 25:18.480
That's you trying to wipe your
parents off the face of the Earth.

25:18.520 --> 25:20.240
It wasn't enough
that they were dead.

25:20.280 --> 25:25.000
You had to burn all trace
that they had ever existed.

25:25.040 --> 25:27.400
And they are not here
to defend themselves, are they?

25:27.440 --> 25:30.480
I don't -
The victims of these shootings,

25:30.520 --> 25:32.760
what would they have told us,
do you think?

25:32.800 --> 25:34.680
What would be their side
- of the story?
- Please.

25:34.720 --> 25:37.120
You have painted them
in the worst possible light.

25:37.160 --> 25:40.440
You were their daughter,
weren't you, their only daughter?

25:40.480 --> 25:44.120
No, they said I was a mistake
and they said they never
wanted to get married,

25:44.160 --> 25:46.200
they wouldn't have,
if Mum hadn't got pregnant.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.800
They hated each other
and they didn't want me.

25:48.840 --> 25:51.880
But they must have loved you on
some level, they were your parents.

25:51.920 --> 25:54.600
No, no, cos I'm...
I'm impossible to love.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.280
Mrs Edwards?

25:57.400 --> 25:59.320
I'm impossible to love.

25:59.360 --> 26:02.000
That's what my mother
would say to me all the time

26:02.040 --> 26:04.000
and it's true...

26:05.520 --> 26:07.680
I... I know now that it's true.

26:11.240 --> 26:13.280
Would you like to take a break,
Mrs Edwards,

26:13.320 --> 26:15.960
if you're having
a bit of a fragile moment?

26:16.680 --> 26:19.240
No.

26:19.280 --> 26:21.280
I'm not fragile.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.040
I'm not fragile.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.000
I'm broken.

26:26.040 --> 26:28.040
So, you can't hurt me.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.720
You can send me to prison
and you can all laugh at me

26:31.760 --> 26:33.880
and you can make me look like
a piece of dirt

26:33.920 --> 26:37.880
in front of all these people
but I'm broken so you can't hurt me.

26:38.800 --> 26:40.840
No-one can hurt me any more.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.800
Chris!

27:33.360 --> 27:35.160
Chris!

28:01.040 --> 28:02.840
Chris!

28:10.560 --> 28:11.880
'(GUNSHOT)'

28:48.000 --> 28:50.200
Do you want to get
an ice cream cone?

28:50.240 --> 28:53.480
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, I'm gonna get strawberry.

29:15.160 --> 29:18.320
'There's not much we can do
about it now, is there?'

29:21.480 --> 29:23.640
I did have one thought, though...

29:24.360 --> 29:27.680
..that maybe we should've told the
barrister or I should have told you

29:27.720 --> 29:29.480
about Gerard Depardieu.

29:30.760 --> 29:33.040
I've never told anyone this before.

29:33.080 --> 29:35.480
Are you sure you wanna tell me?

29:39.520 --> 29:43.120
So, just after Chris's brother
passed away,

29:43.840 --> 29:46.480
I wrote to Gerard Depardieu,
asking for a signed photo

29:46.520 --> 29:48.640
cos I thought it would
cheer Chris up.

29:48.680 --> 29:52.480
He didn't know anything about films
or France when we got together.

29:52.520 --> 29:55.840
But, er, somehow, he did know
about Gerard Depardieu.

29:57.160 --> 30:00.720
'And then, eventually,
after a few weeks of waiting,

30:00.760 --> 30:04.720
I decided I would write
back to Chris

30:04.760 --> 30:07.320
pretending to be Gerard Depardieu.

30:07.360 --> 30:10.240
I practised his signature
until I got it just right.

30:10.280 --> 30:13.480
And I practised his handwriting.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.720
And I put in spelling mistakes
and things,

30:15.760 --> 30:18.800
you know, so it looked like
it was written by a French person.

30:18.840 --> 30:20.360
Well, it worked. He bought it.'

30:20.400 --> 30:22.560
And it made him so happy...

30:22.600 --> 30:24.040
that I just kept doing it.

30:24.080 --> 30:26.680
I kept writing to him,
pretending I was Gerard Depardieu.

30:26.720 --> 30:28.840
And then Chris would write back,
all excited.

30:28.880 --> 30:31.400
But he never knew
that I was behind it all.

30:31.440 --> 30:33.320
Er, where was he sending
the letters?

30:33.360 --> 30:35.200
Oh, well, I thought of all that too.

30:35.240 --> 30:37.480
So, the first one went
to erm... Apartment 16,

30:37.520 --> 30:40.320
Rue Madam Zephirine, 75014 Paris.

30:40.360 --> 30:42.080
And then there was
an address in Belgium.

30:42.120 --> 30:43.920
And later on,
there was an address in Russia.

30:43.960 --> 30:45.560
But I just made them all up.'

30:45.600 --> 30:47.080
Bye, love!

30:47.120 --> 30:48.880
Have a nice day!

30:52.480 --> 30:54.560
'Cos it didn't matter
where they ended up.

30:54.600 --> 30:56.920
I always read his letters
before he sent them,

30:56.960 --> 30:58.760
so I knew exactly how to reply.

30:58.800 --> 31:01.480
And you might think that Chris
would become suspicious

31:01.520 --> 31:04.560
those letters had London postmarks,
but they didn't.

31:04.600 --> 31:07.000
Because I had a franking machine!

31:07.040 --> 31:10.760
Just had to pick a few well chosen
words in the right language

31:10.800 --> 31:12.440
and hey, presto.'

31:12.480 --> 31:15.840
'Wow...and you did all that
just to make Chris happy.'

31:16.760 --> 31:19.600
'I think, even if I told him,
he wouldn't believe me.'

31:20.520 --> 31:23.520
"Good morning,
I'm Gerard Depardieu."

31:23.560 --> 31:25.440
"No, you're not Gerard Depardieu -

31:25.480 --> 31:28.600
you're a librarian from Harlesden,
for crying out loud!"

31:32.200 --> 31:34.200
Least, I don't think he knew.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.000
Mm.

31:37.040 --> 31:38.960
It wouldn't have helped, would it?

31:39.720 --> 31:41.360
Mm-mm.

31:48.120 --> 31:50.080
I get you, Susan.

31:50.800 --> 31:52.800
I don't know why I get you,
but I get you.

31:52.840 --> 31:55.680
And I find that story really sweet.

31:55.720 --> 31:58.880
That you would do something
like that for him.

31:58.920 --> 32:00.760
But other people...

32:00.800 --> 32:02.800
Yeah.
..might not get it.

32:04.240 --> 32:06.680
I just think it wouldn't
have played, that's all,

32:06.720 --> 32:08.240
because you're on trial.

32:08.280 --> 32:10.760
Anything weird,
anything that isn't just "normal",

32:10.800 --> 32:13.720
will make people assume -
They'll think I'm bad news.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.240
And I hate that, by the way.

32:17.280 --> 32:18.840
Because...

32:19.880 --> 32:21.880
..I like that you're you.

32:22.800 --> 32:27.320
Honestly, I... I honestly think
I will carry this experience with me

32:27.360 --> 32:29.480
for the rest of my life because...

32:30.760 --> 32:33.120
..you know what,
you're right, Susan.

32:33.920 --> 32:35.960
I'm lucky.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.560
It's not the same for me.

32:38.600 --> 32:41.360
And you've helped me
to appreciate that.

32:41.400 --> 32:44.840
Not because you're unlucky.
I don't mean it like that, though.

32:46.120 --> 32:48.760
Or maybe I DO mean it like that.
I... I... I dunno.

32:49.840 --> 32:52.400
I'm not saying
that has to define you

32:52.440 --> 32:56.440
or that it's even the reason why
we're here right now in court but...

32:58.560 --> 33:01.520
..they should have looked after you,
Susan.

33:01.560 --> 33:04.120
They were your parents.
You were seven years old.

33:04.160 --> 33:07.560
Do you know how tall
a seven-year-old is? This tall.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.320
This tall.

33:12.920 --> 33:16.320
So, er... I'm still learning.

33:18.360 --> 33:20.760
Maybe I could have done
a better job for you.

33:20.800 --> 33:22.760
I don't know.

33:22.800 --> 33:25.040
I tried my best, I really did.

33:26.480 --> 33:28.960
But I just wanted to make sure
that you understand

33:29.000 --> 33:31.440
that whatever happens today...

33:33.640 --> 33:36.160
..there's a lot
that has happened in your life

33:36.200 --> 33:38.200
that is not on you.

34:15.440 --> 34:18.800
But given that you left home
in your early twenties...

34:19.520 --> 34:21.520
..15 years before the murders,

34:21.560 --> 34:23.640
I cannot accept that his conduct

34:23.680 --> 34:25.920
explains your decision to kill him.

34:26.640 --> 34:30.760
You thought your parents had
deprived you of an inheritance

34:30.800 --> 34:33.320
that was rightfully yours.

34:33.360 --> 34:36.960
I am sure it was you, Christopher
Edwards, who held the gun.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.240
But I have no doubt
that you were acting together,

34:40.280 --> 34:44.600
and I see no reason to distinguish
between you on sentence.

35:10.720 --> 35:15.160
Can you imagine ever, like,
actually murdering someone?

35:15.200 --> 35:17.280
I can imagine it, yeah.

35:17.320 --> 35:19.160
I don't think I'd ever do it,
though.

35:19.200 --> 35:22.120
Why? Are you thinking of trying it?
Bit of murder?

35:22.160 --> 35:24.640
Just trying to imagine
actually having a gun

35:24.680 --> 35:27.440
and pointing it at your...
Your mum and dad.

35:27.480 --> 35:29.720
Yeah. So fucked up.

35:32.240 --> 35:34.200
It's sad.

35:35.320 --> 35:37.320
Yeah. I guess so.

35:40.960 --> 35:43.160
I threatened me dad once...

35:44.960 --> 35:46.960
..when he'd been at me mum.

35:48.200 --> 35:49.760
I sat on it for a bit.

35:50.640 --> 35:53.120
There was no point me
trying anything when he was pissed

35:53.160 --> 35:54.920
cos he'd just kick the shit
out of me.

35:54.960 --> 35:58.280
But a few days later,
when he was watching telly,

35:58.320 --> 36:00.280
I got an axe from the garage

36:00.320 --> 36:03.720
and I went up to the sofa
and I said...

36:05.560 --> 36:07.960
.."If you touch Mum again...

36:09.680 --> 36:11.840
..I'll chop your fucking head off."

36:14.320 --> 36:16.520
Jesus.

36:16.560 --> 36:18.680
How old were you?

36:18.720 --> 36:20.360
12.

36:22.080 --> 36:24.400
Then what happened?

36:24.440 --> 36:26.160
He left.

36:29.600 --> 36:31.360
Shit, man.

36:33.920 --> 36:35.720
Sorry.

36:40.120 --> 36:42.560
Don't fucking hug me, you twat.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.840
OK.
That's not...

36:44.880 --> 36:47.120
Just offering you a hug. Sorry.
Pervert.

36:47.160 --> 36:50.960
Fuck off. Why would I try it on
after a story like that? That's mad.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.240
When WOULD you do it, then?
I don't know.

36:53.280 --> 36:55.920
I'd just ask you out for a drink,
whenever.

36:55.960 --> 36:57.760
Right.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.160
In what way?

37:00.200 --> 37:02.360
Well, in that way, if you're asking.

37:02.400 --> 37:03.880
Are you asking?

37:03.920 --> 37:05.800
Yeah, all right I'm asking.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.440
No, I don't think so. Sorry.

37:10.680 --> 37:12.440
What?

37:12.480 --> 37:16.720
I would in theory.
But...not in practice.

37:16.760 --> 37:20.840
Maybe in, like, ten years.
Just before my eggs start to dry up.

37:20.880 --> 37:23.400
Shall we go for a drink
just as friends, then?

37:23.440 --> 37:24.960
Or as partners even?

37:25.000 --> 37:28.040
I need a bit more than a drink.
It's been quite an intense few days.

37:28.080 --> 37:30.360
Oh, well, like what?
Like a fuck.

37:30.400 --> 37:33.080
No, not with you.
Don't get any ideas.

37:33.120 --> 37:35.560
You're a sensitive lad, I can tell.

37:35.600 --> 37:39.240
It'll get a bit complicated and then
it'll go a bit... Chris and Susan.

37:39.280 --> 37:41.760
But I'm not gonna offer
to kill your dad for ya.

37:41.800 --> 37:44.640
I'm not asking you to.
We're going to the pub.

37:44.680 --> 37:46.640
You're gonna be my wingman.

37:46.680 --> 37:48.680
Fucking wingman?
Yeah.

37:48.720 --> 37:50.640
Fuck off.

37:50.680 --> 37:52.200
Chop, chop.

38:17.120 --> 38:20.600
'Dear Susan,
thank you for your letters,

38:20.640 --> 38:23.760
which I have been very grateful
to receive.

38:23.800 --> 38:27.000
I'm sorry it's taken me
so long to reply.

38:27.040 --> 38:29.800
The first pen I received
was very scratchy

38:29.840 --> 38:33.200
and I wanted you to be able to read
what I was saying.

38:33.240 --> 38:36.720
So I waited to be furnished
with the brand of implement

38:36.760 --> 38:41.280
I originally asked for, which I'm
happy to say is working much better.

38:45.080 --> 38:48.920
In answer to your question
about Tabitha, the truth is, Susan,

38:48.960 --> 38:51.880
that I don't entirely know
why I did that.

38:52.600 --> 38:55.840
But I do think that,
on some level, you are right.

38:55.880 --> 38:57.720
I felt like I was struggling,

38:57.760 --> 38:59.800
and I needed to ask somebody
for help,

38:59.840 --> 39:04.160
something that,
traditionally speaking,
I have not been very good at.

39:10.160 --> 39:15.280
I think, though, that you're wrong
about how I felt, in other ways.

39:15.320 --> 39:19.400
Because I never felt like
I had to leave the real world behind

39:19.440 --> 39:21.440
to be with you, Susan.

39:21.480 --> 39:27.280
If anything, you are the person
who made the world feel real to me.

39:39.200 --> 39:43.720
It wasn't you who made me
feel trapped, Susan.

39:43.760 --> 39:45.560
It was me.'

39:47.720 --> 39:52.080
'In the movies, there are the good
guys and there are the bad guys.

39:52.120 --> 39:55.600
And I think we will have to accept
that, for most people,

39:55.640 --> 39:58.760
we will always be the bad guys.

39:59.960 --> 40:02.560
But we love each other, Susan.

40:02.600 --> 40:05.640
And nobody can take that
away from us.

40:06.480 --> 40:09.720
Yours forever and always...

40:10.600 --> 40:12.720
..Gerard Depardieu.'

40:27.080 --> 40:29.120
Ah, there you are!

40:29.160 --> 40:31.160
Come with me, please.

40:33.120 --> 40:34.720
Checks, please.

40:46.120 --> 40:48.160
Stand by.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.760
Stand by.

41:11.800 --> 41:13.200
Roll sound.

41:13.240 --> 41:14.680
Sound rolling!

41:14.720 --> 41:16.840
All right, let's do this.

41:19.200 --> 41:21.120
Roll camera!
Rolling!

41:23.960 --> 41:26.440
Ladies and gentlemen,
are you all set?

41:27.800 --> 41:30.080
And...action!
