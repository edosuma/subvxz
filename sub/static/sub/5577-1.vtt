WEBVTT

01:14.737 --> 01:17.071
M-MOM?

01:17.073 --> 01:18.305
ARE YOU AWAKE?

01:18.307 --> 01:19.372
MOM?

01:21.342 --> 01:23.575
ZoZo, WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP?

01:23.577 --> 01:25.276
IT'S STILL EARLY.

01:25.278 --> 01:26.543
GO BACK TO SLEEP.

01:26.545 --> 01:29.279
I CAN'T.
OLIVE IS SCARED.

01:35.718 --> 01:37.552
MOM?

01:52.866 --> 01:54.199
DOWN HERE.

02:01.140 --> 02:03.106
ZoZo, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
UNDER HERE?

02:03.108 --> 02:04.340
MOM, I TOLD YOU --

02:04.342 --> 02:07.376
I DON'T LIKE
THAT STUPID BABY NAME ANYMORE.

02:07.378 --> 02:09.144
MY NAME'S ZOE.

02:10.746 --> 02:13.147
AND I'M UNDER HERE
BECAUSE I'M HIDING.

02:13.149 --> 02:15.349
OLIVE SAID WE HAD TO HIDE.

02:15.351 --> 02:17.551
She dreamed they found us.

02:17.553 --> 02:18.752
WHO DID?

02:20.254 --> 02:21.654
The Breathers.

02:21.656 --> 02:24.590
HEY. WHAT DID
WE JUST TALK ABOUT?

02:24.592 --> 02:27.559
OUR NEW RULE, REMEMBER?
RULE NUMBER FOUR.

02:27.561 --> 02:29.527
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO TALK ABOUT THEM ANYMORE.

02:29.529 --> 02:31.629
I DIDN'T.
OLIVE DID.

02:31.631 --> 02:33.764
WELL, YOU CAN TELL OLIVE
THAT NO ONE FOUND US.

02:33.766 --> 02:36.333
DAD'S BEEN KEEPING WATCH
ALL NIGHT, JUST LIKE ALWAYS.

02:36.335 --> 02:37.334
WE'RE SAFE HERE.

02:37.336 --> 02:38.501
YOU HEAR THAT, OLIVE?

02:41.505 --> 02:44.473
<i> MY SMILE IS STUCK.</i>

02:44.475 --> 02:46.241
HER SMILE'S STUCK.

02:46.243 --> 02:48.910
THAT MEANS SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO BE SMILING ANYMORE.

02:48.912 --> 02:50.444
THAT MEANS
SHE'S STILL SCARED.

02:50.446 --> 02:52.312
WOULD IT
MAKE OLIVE FEEL BETTER

02:52.314 --> 02:54.514
IF WE WENT
AND CHECKED WITH DAD?

02:59.387 --> 03:00.886
It's okay.

03:10.395 --> 03:13.330
All right.

03:13.332 --> 03:14.464
Come on.

03:22.405 --> 03:24.304
It's okay.

03:27.175 --> 03:28.174
Mom, look.

03:28.176 --> 03:29.508
THAT'S JUST DAD.

03:29.510 --> 03:30.642
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE DAD.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.879
UH-OH, SOMEONE HAD
ANOTHER NIGHTMARE, HUH?

03:34.881 --> 03:37.281
OH, D-DAD.

03:37.283 --> 03:38.715
HEY, HEY.

03:40.318 --> 03:41.917
I THOUGHT WE TOLD THOSE
SILLY NIGHTMARES TO GO AWAY.

03:41.919 --> 03:43.251
WE DID.

03:43.253 --> 03:44.919
WELL, THEN
WHY ARE YOU SO SCARED?

03:44.921 --> 03:47.488
BETTER ASK OLIVE
ABOUT THAT.

03:47.490 --> 03:49.890
OH, WAS IT OLIVE
THIS TIME, HUH?

03:49.892 --> 03:52.225
HOW DOES SHE EVEN SLEEP
WITH HER EYES OPEN ALL THE TIME?

03:52.227 --> 03:53.793
DAD, DON'T BE MEAN.

03:53.795 --> 03:55.327
I'M JUST WONDERING.

03:55.329 --> 03:56.761
SHE WANTS A REPORT.

03:56.763 --> 03:58.796
WELL, THEN I BETTER
CONSULT MY NOTES.

04:10.340 --> 04:12.674
HMM.

04:12.676 --> 04:14.442
MY GLASSES, PLEASE.

04:14.444 --> 04:17.311
THANK YOU.

04:17.313 --> 04:18.578
SO...

04:18.580 --> 04:22.815
MY WATCH STARTED
AT 10:00.

04:22.817 --> 04:26.451
AT, UH, 2:00, I PLAYED
SEVEN GAMES OF SOLITAIRE.

04:26.453 --> 04:28.586
WON FOUR, LOST THREE.

04:28.588 --> 04:30.688
LOST FOUR, WON THREE.

04:30.690 --> 04:33.557
MISS ZOE,
YOU SEE RIGHT THROUGH ME.

04:33.559 --> 04:36.426
AT 5:00, A COUPLE OF DEER
RAN OVERHEAD.

04:36.428 --> 04:38.361
AND AT 6:00
IN THE MORNING,

04:38.363 --> 04:41.497
I HEARD LITTLE FOOTSTEPS.

04:41.499 --> 04:45.667
POSSIBLY BELONGING
TO MY RASCAL OF A DAUGHTER!

04:45.669 --> 04:46.734
HMM?

04:48.470 --> 04:50.537
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,
NOTHING.

04:50.539 --> 04:53.373
NOT A CREATURE WAS STIRRING,
NOT EVEN A --

04:53.375 --> 04:54.374
A BREATHER?

04:54.376 --> 04:55.975
ZoZo.

04:58.878 --> 05:00.745
NO.

05:00.747 --> 05:03.814
NOT EVEN A --
YOU KNOW.

05:03.816 --> 05:06.716
AND THE LOCKS?

05:09.019 --> 05:11.687
THEY STILL HOLD FAST?

05:11.689 --> 05:12.988
DO YOU WANNA CHECK?

05:12.990 --> 05:14.656
CAN I?
NO.

05:14.658 --> 05:16.891
RAY, I TOLD YOU I DON'T WANT HER
GOING UP THERE ANYMORE.

05:16.893 --> 05:18.893
WHAT?
THIS LITTLE MONKEY?

05:18.895 --> 05:20.361
SHE CAN HANDLE IT.

05:20.363 --> 05:21.962
YEAH,
I CAN HANDLE IT, MOM.

05:21.964 --> 05:22.996
I KNOW THE RULES.

05:22.998 --> 05:24.330
ONE, NEVER BE LOUD.

05:24.332 --> 05:25.464
I KNOW
YOU KNOW THE RULES.

05:25.466 --> 05:26.465
TWO, NEVER LOSE CONTROL.

05:26.467 --> 05:27.666
THREE, NEVER OPEN THE DOOR.

05:27.668 --> 05:28.900
FOUR, NEVER TALK
ABOUT THE BREATHERS.

05:37.342 --> 05:39.042
CAREFUL, ZoZo,
YOUR SHOE.

05:39.044 --> 05:41.310
GOT IT, MOM.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.021
HOLD FAST?

06:30.456 --> 06:32.590
HOLD FAST.

06:46.370 --> 06:48.537
CAN'T I JUST
GO BAREFOOT?

06:48.539 --> 06:50.772
NO,
THAT WOULDN'T BE RIGHT.

06:50.774 --> 06:52.874
WHY NOT?

06:54.009 --> 06:56.744
BECAUSE
WE'RE NOT ANIMALS, ZOE.

06:57.812 --> 07:00.480
I NEED YOU
TO REMEMBER THAT.

07:00.482 --> 07:03.015
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M GOING OUTSIDE OR ANYTHING.

07:03.017 --> 07:05.917
WELL, WHO NEEDS TO GO OUTSIDE
WHEN WE BROUGHT THE SUN WITH US?

07:13.092 --> 07:15.525
ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL DAY,
HUH?

07:15.527 --> 07:17.927
MM-HMM.

07:19.130 --> 07:21.063
DO YOU WANNA
MAKE IT OFFICIAL?

07:28.871 --> 07:31.038
NOT TOO HARD, OKAY?
I DON'T WANT YOU TO
SLIP AND CUT YOUR HAND.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.105
I GOT IT, MOM.

07:33.507 --> 07:34.807
OKAY.

07:34.809 --> 07:37.075
HOW MANY DAYS
IS THAT NOW?

07:37.077 --> 07:38.910
WELL, IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER,
JUST COUNT THEM.

07:38.912 --> 07:40.645
THEY'RE LINED UP
IN ROWS OF 25,

07:40.647 --> 07:42.079
AND THERE ARE
HOW MANY ROWS?

07:42.081 --> 07:44.881
One, two, three,
eight, nine...

07:44.883 --> 07:45.882
12.

07:45.884 --> 07:47.483
SO 25 TIMES 12 MAKES?

07:47.485 --> 07:51.153
300 PLUS THE ONE
JUST I MARKED, SO 301.

07:51.155 --> 07:52.821
THAT'S IT.

07:52.823 --> 07:54.956
SEE? THOSE MATH LESSONS
ARE REALLY PAYING OFF.

07:57.659 --> 08:00.827
<i> GIVE ME A KISS.</i>

08:00.829 --> 08:02.161
THAT MEANS SHE'S HUNGRY.

08:05.932 --> 08:07.032
LET'S SEE HERE.

08:07.034 --> 08:09.034
WE'VE GOT HOMINY...

08:09.036 --> 08:10.168
CORN...

08:10.170 --> 08:11.802
POTATOES...

08:11.804 --> 08:14.871
BEANS...

08:14.873 --> 08:16.005
AND PEACHES --

08:16.007 --> 08:17.606
PEACHES.
DEFINITELY PEACHES.

08:17.608 --> 08:19.474
YOU KNOW,
WE HAD PEACHES YESTERDAY.

08:19.476 --> 08:20.942
WE CAN HAVE THEM AGAIN
TOMORROW.

08:20.944 --> 08:22.677
BUT I WAS THINKING TODAY,

08:22.679 --> 08:25.012
MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY SOMETHING
WITH A LITTLE PROTEIN.

08:25.014 --> 08:26.747
MAYBE BEANS, FOR ONCE.

08:26.749 --> 08:28.615
EW,
BEANS ARE THE WORST.

08:28.617 --> 08:29.849
DAD?
YEAH?

08:29.851 --> 08:31.083
BEANS OR PEACHES?

08:31.085 --> 08:33.952
UH, I DON'T KNOW.

08:33.954 --> 08:35.019
Peaches.

08:35.021 --> 08:36.920
PEACHES SOUND
PRETTY GOOD TO ME.

08:36.922 --> 08:37.987
RAY.

08:40.090 --> 08:43.459
UH, HOW ABOUT
WE TAKE A VOTE?
RAY.

08:43.461 --> 08:46.562
ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF BEANS,
PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND.

08:47.530 --> 08:48.763
ONE VOTE FOR BEANS.

08:48.765 --> 08:49.997
NOW, ALL THOSE IN FAVOR

08:49.999 --> 08:51.798
OF DELICIOUSLY SWEET
AND JUICY PEACHES,

08:51.800 --> 08:52.999
PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND.

08:55.002 --> 08:57.003
SORRY, HON.

08:57.005 --> 08:59.071
TWO AGAINST ONE.

08:59.073 --> 09:00.472
THREE.

09:26.164 --> 09:28.798
IS DARLENE
ACTING UP AGAIN?

09:28.800 --> 09:31.033
OH, SHE'S A TOUGH GAL.

09:31.035 --> 09:34.035
SHE JUST NEEDS A LITTLE
ENCOURAGEMENT, THAT'S ALL.

09:37.206 --> 09:38.271
HM.

09:49.715 --> 09:51.347
THERE WE GO.
TOLD YOU SHE WAS TOUGH.

09:53.117 --> 09:54.950
MOM, DAD!
THE PEACHES ARE GONE!

09:54.952 --> 09:56.151
NOT FUNNY, ZoZo.

09:56.153 --> 09:57.852
I'M SERIOUS!
SOMEONE STOLE THEM!

10:28.047 --> 10:31.082
GOD, THAT'S 12.
THAT'S 12 CANS.

10:31.084 --> 10:33.384
THAT'S ALMOST
TWO WEEKS OF RATIONS.

10:33.386 --> 10:35.753
THERE ARE
NO MORE PEACHES?

10:35.755 --> 10:38.789
UH, NO.
NO MORE PEACHES.

10:38.791 --> 10:40.257
SOMETHING MUST'VE BEEN
DRAWN TO THE SUGAR.

10:40.259 --> 10:41.858
SOMETHING WITH TEETH.

10:41.860 --> 10:44.193
WHAT HAS TEETH
LIKE THAT?

10:44.195 --> 10:45.627
A RAT, PROBABLY.

10:45.629 --> 10:47.695
BUT A RAT
COULDN'T GET IN HERE.

10:47.697 --> 10:49.897
I CHECKED THE DOOR,
IT'S HOLD FAST.

10:49.899 --> 10:52.299
THE DOOR IS NOT
THE ONLY WAY IN.

10:59.872 --> 11:02.840
CAN THE BREATHERS
GET IN THERE TOO?

11:02.842 --> 11:03.841
ZoZo.

11:03.843 --> 11:05.108
CAN THEY?

11:05.110 --> 11:08.344
NO, THEY'RE TOO BIG
TO FIT IN THERE.

11:08.346 --> 11:10.412
BUT A RAT COULD.

11:12.381 --> 11:15.116
IF IT'S A RAT,
IT'S STILL IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

11:17.018 --> 11:19.252
WE HAVE TO
KEEP AN EYE OUT.

11:19.254 --> 11:22.788
WE HAVE TO FIND IT
BEFORE IT STEALS ANY MORE FOOD.

11:22.790 --> 11:26.258
IN THE MEANTIME, WE'LL HAVE TO
CUT DOWN ON OUR RATIONS.

11:26.260 --> 11:29.261
DAD,
THEY'RE ALREADY SO SMALL.

11:33.098 --> 11:35.365
I'M SORRY, ZOE.

11:36.934 --> 11:39.302
I REALLY AM.

11:53.382 --> 11:55.750
I'M NOT GONNA
ASK YOU AGAIN. EAT.

11:55.752 --> 11:57.284
MOM, I TOLD YOU
I DON'T WANT STUPID BEANS.

11:57.286 --> 11:59.286
HEY, ZoZo,
REMEMBER RULE NUMBER TWO.

11:59.288 --> 12:01.121
NEVER LOSE CONTROL.

12:01.123 --> 12:02.956
NEVER LET ANGER
TAKE OVER.

12:02.958 --> 12:04.424
RULE NUMBER FIVE,
NEVER CALL ME ZoZo.

12:04.426 --> 12:06.192
I JUST WANTED
SOME PEACHES.

12:06.194 --> 12:07.860
WELL,
A THIEF STOLE THEM,

12:07.862 --> 12:10.095
AND NOW WE'RE ALL GONNA
HAVE TO GIVE SOME THINGS UP.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.796
I ALREADY HAVE NOTHING.

12:11.798 --> 12:14.365
I'M STUCK IN HERE.
I CAN'T EVEN GO OUTSIDE.

12:14.367 --> 12:17.267
I DON'T HAVE
ANY FRIENDS...

12:17.269 --> 12:19.469
EXCEPT OLIVE, AND SHE CAN
ONLY SAY FIVE THINGS.

12:19.471 --> 12:21.471
WHAT ABOUT US?
WHAT?

12:21.473 --> 12:24.941
WELL, YOU SAID
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS.

12:24.943 --> 12:26.142
WHAT ABOUT US?

12:26.144 --> 12:27.776
MOM AND I
AREN'T YOUR FRIENDS?

12:27.778 --> 12:29.811
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
NO, ACTUALLY, I DON'T.

12:29.813 --> 12:31.846
I THINK IT'S REAL SILLY
TO SAY YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

12:31.848 --> 12:33.881
WHEN YOU REALLY HAVE
<i> EVERYTHING.</i>

12:33.883 --> 12:35.315
YEAH, RIGHT.
YEAH, RIGHT.

12:35.317 --> 12:37.083
LOOK AT THAT.

12:37.085 --> 12:39.952
HOW MANY DAYS
DID YOU SAY THAT WAS?

12:39.954 --> 12:42.087
301.

12:42.089 --> 12:45.090
301.

12:45.092 --> 12:46.191
NOW, WE SHOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN AROUND

12:46.193 --> 12:47.926
FOR ANY ONE
OF THOSE DAYS,

12:47.928 --> 12:50.828
BUT JUST
WHEN WE NEEDED IT,

12:50.830 --> 12:52.830
WE FOUND THIS SHELTER.

12:52.832 --> 12:56.400
AND IT'S GIVEN US
FOOD, A HOME, A LIFE.

12:56.402 --> 12:59.369
AND FOR ALL WE KNOW,
WE COULD BE THE ONLY ONES LEFT,

12:59.371 --> 13:02.238
THE ONLY ONES
STILL ALIVE.

13:02.240 --> 13:07.742
SO EVERY ONE OF THOSE MARKS
IS REALLY A MIRACLE.

13:08.744 --> 13:09.844
A MIRACLE?

13:09.846 --> 13:11.245
THAT'S RIGHT.
A MIRACLE.

13:11.247 --> 13:14.114
AND THIS FOOD IS GONNA ALLOW YOU
TO LIVE ANOTHER DAY.

13:14.116 --> 13:16.816
AND THAT MEANS ANOTHER HATCH
CAN BE DRAWN, RIGHT?

13:16.818 --> 13:18.751
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

13:18.753 --> 13:24.322
SO YOU SEE, THOSE NASTY, COLD,
MUSHY BEANS ON YOUR PLATE,

13:24.324 --> 13:27.258
THEY'RE REALLY
THEIR OWN KIND OF MIRACLE TOO.

13:27.260 --> 13:31.361
AND IF YOU EAT
YOUR MUSHY MIRACLES FOR US...

13:33.163 --> 13:36.064
...THEN MAYBE WE CAN
TAKE A TRIP AFTERWARDS.

13:36.066 --> 13:37.231
A TRIP? REALLY?

13:37.233 --> 13:38.532
REALLY.

13:38.534 --> 13:40.200
BUT YOU BETTER EAT FAST,

13:40.202 --> 13:43.336
'CAUSE I FINISHED MY MIRACLE
BEANS, AND I WANT MORE!

13:47.507 --> 13:49.941
CAREFUL WITH IT, DAD.

13:54.078 --> 13:55.445
THAT GOES THERE.
JOEY'S HOUSE GOES THERE.

13:55.447 --> 13:58.247
ALL RIGHT. OFF WE GO.

13:58.249 --> 14:00.015
EIGHT.

14:01.817 --> 14:03.517
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN...

14:03.519 --> 14:04.985
SYLVIA'S ICE CREAM!

14:07.054 --> 14:09.121
OKAY.

14:09.123 --> 14:10.856
LET ME GET THE DOOR.

14:12.192 --> 14:13.891
DOOR'S OPEN.

14:15.193 --> 14:17.227
THE CHIMES RING ABOVE YOU.

14:19.130 --> 14:22.131
AND LOOK, THERE'S SYLVIA
STANDING BEHIND THE COUNTER,

14:22.133 --> 14:25.934
AND SHE'S WEARING
THAT SILLY CONE-SHAPED APRON.

14:25.936 --> 14:29.404
"GOOD MORNING, LITTLE ZOE."

14:32.075 --> 14:35.009
AND SHE HANDS YOU ONE OF THOSE
LITTLE, PINK PLASTIC SPOONS.

14:37.579 --> 14:39.079
THEN YOU RUN
YOUR OTHER HAND

14:39.081 --> 14:41.414
ALONG THAT COLD
GLASS COUNTERTOP.

14:44.251 --> 14:47.386
INSIDE, YOU SEE
BARRELS AND BARRELS

14:47.388 --> 14:50.589
OF SYLVIA'S
FRESH HOMEMADE ICE CREAM.

14:50.591 --> 14:53.825
NOW, IT'S STILL EARLY, SO SHE'S
GOT ALL THE BEST FLAVORS.

14:53.827 --> 14:57.428
SALTED HONEY,
PEANUT BUTTER BRITTLE CRUNCH,

14:57.430 --> 15:01.365
AND, OF COURSE,
YOUR FAVORITE.

15:01.367 --> 15:03.567
STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE.

15:06.104 --> 15:07.870
ARE YOU THERE?

15:16.212 --> 15:18.112
YOU HAPPY NOW?

15:20.215 --> 15:21.982
TILL TOMORROW.

15:22.950 --> 15:24.550
TILL TOMORROW.

15:39.165 --> 15:41.031
UH, YOU WIN.

15:44.535 --> 15:46.068
I WIN.

15:50.206 --> 15:52.207
AHA! I WIN.

15:52.209 --> 15:54.008
EVERYTHING'S GONNA WORK OUT.

15:54.010 --> 15:56.343
I'M TRYING TO BELIEVE THAT, RAY.
I REALLY AM.

15:56.345 --> 15:59.612
BUT IMAGINARY ICE CREAM
ISN'T GONNA FEED OUR DAUGHTER.

15:59.614 --> 16:01.380
I'M JUST TRYING
TO KEEP HER SPIRITS UP.

16:01.382 --> 16:02.914
AND YOU<i> ARE.</i>

16:02.916 --> 16:05.249
BUT WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN SHE GETS SICK?

16:05.251 --> 16:09.619
WE'VE LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT
ALREADY, ALL OF US.

16:09.621 --> 16:11.387
AND NOW...

16:11.389 --> 16:15.190
AND NOW WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO
FIND A WAY TO GET MORE FOOD.

16:15.192 --> 16:17.892
<i> REAL</i> FOOD.

16:17.894 --> 16:19.493
GO TO THE DAMN SURFACE
IF I HAVE TO.

16:19.495 --> 16:21.561
YOU CAN'T, RAY. THEY'RE --
THEY'RE STILL LOOKING FOR US.

16:21.563 --> 16:23.262
YEAH, WELL,
I CAN FIGHT THEM.

16:23.264 --> 16:25.030
THAT'S SUICIDE,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

16:28.901 --> 16:32.069
YOU REMEMBER OUR PROMISE
WHEN WE FIRST GOT HERE?

16:32.071 --> 16:34.438
ZOE COMES FIRST.

16:34.440 --> 16:36.206
NO MATTER THE COST.

16:37.975 --> 16:40.209
THE IMPORTANT THING IS
WE STILL HAVEN'T BEEN FOUND.

16:40.211 --> 16:41.276
EXCEPT BY A RAT.

16:41.278 --> 16:43.378
BUT<i> ONLY</i> BY A RAT.

16:49.384 --> 16:51.651
OH, HONEY.

17:00.527 --> 17:03.662
TRY CHANGING
YOUR POINT OF VIEW.

17:03.664 --> 17:07.532
THIS SHELTER CAN BE A PRISON,
OR IT CAN BE A HOME.

17:07.534 --> 17:09.367
BEANS CAN BE BEANS,
OR THEY CAN BE --

17:09.369 --> 17:11.068
MIRACLE BEANS.

17:12.136 --> 17:13.369
WHY NOT?

17:13.371 --> 17:16.271
BECAUSE I'M NOT
NINE YEARS OLD, RAY.

17:16.273 --> 17:18.573
I GET WHAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO DO FOR ZoZo.

17:20.509 --> 17:22.509
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE
IN MIRACLES.

17:25.713 --> 17:27.080
NOT ANYMORE.

17:27.082 --> 17:28.214
YOU SHOULD.

17:28.216 --> 17:30.716
THIS IS OUR LIFE NOW,

17:30.718 --> 17:33.685
AND WE HAVE TO LIVE IT
THE BEST WE CAN.

17:36.188 --> 17:38.222
OR ELSE WHAT'S THE POINT?

17:38.224 --> 17:40.257
THE POINT
IS TO STAY ALIVE.

17:40.259 --> 17:41.625
WE CAN DO THAT...

17:44.295 --> 17:46.228
...AND STILL LIVE.

17:49.198 --> 17:50.765
HMM?

18:00.575 --> 18:01.775
RAY?

18:01.777 --> 18:03.109
HUH?

18:03.111 --> 18:05.277
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:05.279 --> 18:06.645
LIVING.

18:10.683 --> 18:12.617
WE GOT TO BE
REAL QUIET.

18:12.619 --> 18:13.751
Relax.

18:43.747 --> 18:45.881
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

18:47.783 --> 18:49.583
HAVE FUN.

18:59.360 --> 19:02.260
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON! NO,
NO, NO! TOO FAR TO WALK THERE!

19:02.262 --> 19:04.662
MOM! MOM! PLEASE!

19:04.664 --> 19:07.197
ZOE!

19:07.199 --> 19:09.732
MOM! DAD!
THEY'RE COMING!

19:20.342 --> 19:22.176
UH-OH. THAT'S A DOOZY.

19:22.178 --> 19:23.610
A FIVE AND A TWO.

19:23.612 --> 19:26.245
SO, FIVE
DIVIDED BY TWO IS...

19:26.247 --> 19:27.379
TWO AND A HALF.

19:27.381 --> 19:29.781
BINGO.
YOU CAN MOVE YOUR CAR NOW.

19:29.783 --> 19:32.683
COME ON. I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE
A FUN CHANGE OF PACE.

19:32.685 --> 19:35.285
IT'S STILL BORING MATH, MOM.
EVEN WITH KINGSVILLE.

19:35.287 --> 19:38.254
WELL, IF IT'S SO BORING,
HOW COME OLIVE'S STILL SMILING?

19:39.456 --> 19:40.889
THAT'S HER FAKE SMILE.

19:40.891 --> 19:44.392
THAT'S WHY SHE LOOKS
A LITTLE, YOU KNOW...

19:44.394 --> 19:45.926
CREEPY?

19:45.928 --> 19:47.727
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT, HONEY.

19:47.729 --> 19:51.230
SHE JUST...NEEDS A BATH.
THAT'S ALL.

19:51.232 --> 19:53.232
HOW ABOUT WE HAVE
ANOTHER GO AROUND THE BOARD

19:53.234 --> 19:55.801
AND THEN
WE TAKE A BREAK, OKAY?

19:55.803 --> 19:56.868
OKAY.

20:05.276 --> 20:08.678
MOM, DO YOU THINK
DAD'S RIGHT?

20:08.680 --> 20:10.513
RIGHT ABOUT WHAT?

20:10.515 --> 20:14.717
YOU KNOW, ABOUT THE THREE OF US
BEING THE ONLY ONES LEFT.

20:20.222 --> 20:22.256
THE PERISCOPE?

20:22.258 --> 20:23.757
THAT'S RIGHT.

20:24.959 --> 20:26.492
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO WITH IT?

20:26.494 --> 20:27.726
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:29.195 --> 20:31.763
I WANT YOU
TO LOOK UP THERE.

20:31.765 --> 20:33.231
ON THE SURFACE?

20:33.233 --> 20:34.665
MM-HMM.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.500
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
I WASN'T ALLOWED TO DO THAT,

20:36.502 --> 20:38.835
EVER, EVER, EVER,
OR I'D BE DEAD MEAT.

20:38.837 --> 20:41.537
YEAH, WELL...

20:41.539 --> 20:43.605
I'M TRYING SOMETHING NEW
TODAY.

20:43.607 --> 20:44.839
WHAT?

20:45.907 --> 20:47.641
RELAXING.

21:41.490 --> 21:43.858
SO, WHAT DO YOU SEE?

21:44.826 --> 21:46.359
NOTHING.

21:46.361 --> 21:48.728
THE SCHOOL. PLAYGROUND.

21:48.730 --> 21:50.763
NOTHING.

21:50.765 --> 21:52.030
DAD'S RIGHT.

21:52.032 --> 21:54.265
IT'S JUST US LEFT.

21:54.267 --> 21:55.532
US AND OLIVE.

21:55.534 --> 21:57.600
BUT DO YOU SEE
US AND OLIVE?
NO, MOM.

21:57.602 --> 21:59.001
DO YOU EVEN SEE
THE SHELTER DOOR?

22:03.039 --> 22:04.906
I CAN'T SEE THE DOOR.

22:04.908 --> 22:05.907
IT'S COVERED.

22:05.909 --> 22:07.008
EXACTLY.

22:08.944 --> 22:10.911
WHEN WE FIRST
CAME DOWN HERE,

22:10.913 --> 22:14.281
DAD AND I MADE SURE
TO HIDE THE DOOR, REMEMBER?

22:14.283 --> 22:16.983
SO THAT NO ONE
COULD EVER FIND US.

22:16.985 --> 22:18.317
SO?

22:18.319 --> 22:21.553
SO...SOMETIMES...

22:21.555 --> 22:23.321
JUST BECAUSE
YOU CAN'T SEE SOMETHING

22:23.323 --> 22:25.022
DOESN'T MEAN
IT'S NOT THERE.

22:28.359 --> 22:30.860
SOMETIMES
THE TRUTH'S HIDDEN FROM US.

22:43.473 --> 22:47.609
SO YOU THINK OUR FRIENDS
COULD REALLY BE OUT THERE?

22:47.611 --> 22:49.844
THEY'RE JUST HIDDEN
LIKE US?

22:49.846 --> 22:52.580
THEY COULD.
THEY'D HAVE TO BE.

22:52.582 --> 22:54.782
BECAUSE THE BREATHERS
WOULD BE HUNTING THEM TOO.

22:54.784 --> 22:56.316
ZoZo.

23:00.921 --> 23:03.522
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
BECAUSE THE BREATHERS WOULD
BE HUNTING THEM TOO.

23:03.524 --> 23:05.524
THEY HATE US A LOT,
DON'T THEY?

23:05.526 --> 23:07.425
TO KEEP HUNTING US
LIKE THAT?

23:07.427 --> 23:09.326
I DON'T KNOW
THAT IT'S HATE.

23:09.328 --> 23:11.695
IT'S JUST --

23:11.697 --> 23:13.430
THEY'RE DIFFERENT
THAN WE ARE,

23:13.432 --> 23:15.765
AND THAT MAKES THEM AS SCARED
OF US AS WE ARE OF THEM.

23:15.767 --> 23:17.500
BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED
THAT DAY?

23:17.502 --> 23:19.401
YEAH, BECAUSE OF
WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY.

23:20.669 --> 23:22.336
YOU SAID "BREATHERS."

23:22.338 --> 23:23.770
YEAH.

23:27.775 --> 23:29.875
THE THIEF.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.576
HE'S BACK.

23:35.646 --> 23:37.847
DON'T LOOK.

23:37.849 --> 23:39.915
HEY.

23:39.917 --> 23:41.917
WHAT'S WRONG?

23:41.919 --> 23:44.452
It's the thief.

23:55.797 --> 23:57.831
THAT SON OF A BITCH.

23:59.967 --> 24:02.969
I'LL KILL IT. JUST STAY BACK
IN CASE IT MAKES A RUN FOR IT.

24:02.971 --> 24:04.403
NO, NO,<i> YOU</i> STAY BACK.
<i> I'LL</i> KILL IT.

24:04.405 --> 24:05.437
NO,<i> I'LL</i> KILL IT.

24:05.439 --> 24:07.705
WE CAN'T ALL KILL IT,
GUYS.

24:07.707 --> 24:09.807
YOU REMEMBER THAT THANKSGIVING
AT AUNT CATHY'S

24:09.809 --> 24:11.074
A COUPLE YEARS AGO,

24:11.076 --> 24:15.978
WITH THAT INSANE POSSUM
IN THE BACKYARD?

24:15.980 --> 24:18.880
WHO TOOK CARE
OF THAT THING?

24:35.964 --> 24:37.798
After Dad kills it,
can we eat it for dinner?

24:37.800 --> 24:38.865
ZoZo, quiet.

24:47.773 --> 24:49.640
GET IT, DAD!

24:52.144 --> 24:53.476
DAD!

24:56.514 --> 24:57.713
GETTING AWAY, DAD!
HURRY!

24:57.715 --> 24:58.847
I KNOW!

25:01.451 --> 25:02.983
DAD!

25:09.556 --> 25:11.122
MOM!

25:14.192 --> 25:15.625
WOW.

25:18.629 --> 25:21.097
THAT WAS AWESOME.

25:21.099 --> 25:23.933
EVEN MORE AWESOME THAN
WHEN DAD KILLED THE POSSUM?

25:23.935 --> 25:24.900
DEFINITELY.

25:27.738 --> 25:28.970
WHAT IS THAT?

25:35.844 --> 25:38.911
GET BACK.
GET BACK THERE.

25:39.913 --> 25:41.079
AAH! GOD DAMN IT!

25:41.081 --> 25:42.113
TURN IT --
TURN IT OFF, DAD.

25:42.115 --> 25:43.781
IT'S GONNA BREAK.
GET BACK.

25:43.783 --> 25:45.048
GET BACK!

25:45.050 --> 25:46.716
BACK!

25:46.718 --> 25:48.484
BACK!

25:52.154 --> 25:53.888
IT'S BURNING KINGSVILLE!

25:53.890 --> 25:56.590
WE'LL PUT IT OUT!
JUST STAY HERE!

25:57.859 --> 25:58.957
STAY HERE!

26:04.564 --> 26:05.829
NO, NOT AGAIN.

26:18.708 --> 26:22.009
RAY! HELP ME!

26:24.846 --> 26:25.912
DON'T BREAK HER!

26:25.914 --> 26:27.079
DARLENE CAN TAKE IT!

26:29.849 --> 26:31.616
RAY, COME ON!

26:36.186 --> 26:38.220
I TOLD YOU SHE'S TOUGH!

26:38.222 --> 26:39.887
ALL RIGHT, GET BACK,
GET BACK!

26:45.827 --> 26:48.761
ZoZo! I TOLD YOU
TO STAY BACK!

27:15.352 --> 27:17.820
I CAN'T SEE A DAMN THING.

27:20.324 --> 27:21.356
HOLD ON.

27:29.131 --> 27:30.296
WHERE'S ZoZo?

27:34.034 --> 27:36.035
ZOE?
ZoZo?

27:37.971 --> 27:39.938
ZoZo?

27:39.940 --> 27:40.972
ZoZo.

27:42.642 --> 27:43.941
HEY.

27:43.943 --> 27:45.342
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
DID THE FIRE BURN YOU?

27:45.344 --> 27:47.077
I'M JUST SCARED.

27:47.079 --> 27:49.712
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE SCARED OF ANYMORE.

27:49.714 --> 27:52.414
WE PUT THE FIRE OUT.
NOBODY'S HURT.

27:52.416 --> 27:54.115
LOOK.

27:54.117 --> 27:55.749
EVEN OLIVE'S OKAY.

27:55.751 --> 27:57.751
JUST A LITTLE DIRTY,
THAT'S ALL.

27:57.753 --> 27:59.953
SEE?

27:59.955 --> 28:01.220
EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE OKAY.

28:01.222 --> 28:02.254
NO, DAD.

28:02.256 --> 28:03.989
IT'S NOT.

28:03.991 --> 28:06.958
IT'S NOT GONNA BE OKAY.

28:06.960 --> 28:09.160
THEY'RE GONNA SEE.

28:10.195 --> 28:11.361
WHO?

28:12.329 --> 28:14.163
THE BREATHERS.

28:33.783 --> 28:35.282
MY GOD.

28:48.428 --> 28:51.128
MMM! HELLO, BACON.

28:52.431 --> 28:54.431
WHERE'D YOUR LITTLE SOUS-CHEF
RUN OFF TO?

28:54.433 --> 28:55.999
UPSTAIRS,
GETTING READY.

28:56.001 --> 28:57.266
STILL?

28:57.268 --> 28:59.801
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE
TO PUT ON A SWIMSUIT?

28:59.803 --> 29:02.737
LONG TIME WHEN YOU'RE TRYING
TO IMPRESS JOEY.

29:02.739 --> 29:05.439
JOEY?
YEAH, HE'S COMING
TO THE "Y" WITH US.

29:05.441 --> 29:07.073
JOEY NEARY NEXT DOOR?

29:07.075 --> 29:09.975
HE'S A REAL CUTIE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

29:09.977 --> 29:11.910
I THINK HE CAN BARELY
TIE HIS OWN SHOES.

29:11.912 --> 29:12.911
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

29:12.913 --> 29:14.879
JOEY NEARY.

29:14.881 --> 29:16.981
COME ON, YOU REMEMBER
YOUNG LOVE, DON'T YOU?

29:16.983 --> 29:19.817
YEAH, WELL, I HAD DEFINITELY
OUTGROWN NERF WEAPONS

29:19.819 --> 29:20.951
BY OUR FIRST DATE.

29:22.754 --> 29:24.153
I DON'T LIKE THIS
AT ALL.

29:24.155 --> 29:25.721
DAD,
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

29:25.723 --> 29:27.255
WHAT?
TELL YOU WHAT?

29:27.257 --> 29:28.489
THAT JOEY'S
GOING ON VACATION.

29:28.491 --> 29:30.390
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO PLAY
MARCO POLO.

29:30.392 --> 29:32.759
WELL, THAT CAN'T BE TRUE,
BECAUSE I TALKED TO
JILLIAN LAST NIGHT.

29:32.761 --> 29:34.861
JUST LEAVE IT. WE DON'T NEED IT.

29:34.863 --> 29:36.863
COME ON. WE HAVE TO.
COME ON, COME ON.

29:36.865 --> 29:38.464
LEAVE EVERYTHING THERE.
WE GOT WHAT WE NEED.

29:43.435 --> 29:44.735
COME ON.

29:46.037 --> 29:47.070
HEY, TED?

29:47.072 --> 29:48.137
THAT'S GOOD.

29:48.139 --> 29:49.404
JILLIAN?

29:49.406 --> 29:50.471
WHAT ELSE?

29:50.473 --> 29:51.472
TED? IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
JILLIAN?

29:53.776 --> 29:55.509
HEY, JOEY.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

29:55.511 --> 29:57.043
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE.
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO LEAVE?

29:57.045 --> 29:58.511
THE GOVERNMENT MAN.

29:58.513 --> 30:01.747
HE SAID -- THE VIRUS.
IT CHANGES PEOPLE BAD.

30:01.749 --> 30:04.015
THE WHAT?
WHAT KIND OF VIRUS?
JOEY, COME ON.
WE HAVE TO GO.

30:04.017 --> 30:06.183
JILLIAN,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
I'M SORRY, CLAIRE.
THERE'S NO TIME.

30:06.185 --> 30:08.285
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
JUST GET ZOE AND GET AS FAR AWAY
FROM KINGSVILLE AS YOU CAN.

30:08.287 --> 30:10.186
GET IN THE CAR. LET'S GO.

30:10.188 --> 30:13.055
TELL ZOE I'M SORRY
I CAN'T PLAY MARCO POLO!

30:15.025 --> 30:16.257
TED!

30:16.259 --> 30:17.925
CAN'T GO BACK
FOR THE OTHERS.

30:22.796 --> 30:24.062
WHERE'S
EVERYONE GOING?

30:26.866 --> 30:28.265
COME ON, SANDRA. JUST
PACK THAT UP! I'LL DO MY BEST!

30:47.183 --> 30:49.250
The Breathers.

30:49.252 --> 30:51.785
They're gonna see it,
aren't they?

30:52.953 --> 30:54.486
AREN'T THEY?

30:56.222 --> 30:57.555
WELL, IT'S SUNDOWN.

30:57.557 --> 30:59.557
MAYBE IT'S TOO DARK
TO SEE THE SMOKE.

31:01.159 --> 31:02.893
MAYBE.

31:30.420 --> 31:32.053
Can you see
any smoke?

31:39.294 --> 31:41.927
DON'T FORGET RULE TWO,
CLAIRE.

31:41.929 --> 31:44.262
WE HAVE TO STAY CALM.
NO MATTER WHAT, WE HAVE
TO STAY UNDER CONTROL.

31:44.264 --> 31:46.030
WE HAVE TO THINK.

31:46.032 --> 31:48.232
ANYONE WITHIN A MILE OF HERE
WILL HAVE SEEN THAT SMOKE.

31:48.234 --> 31:50.367
THE BREATHERS ARE GONNA
COME FOR US. I KNOW IT.

31:50.369 --> 31:52.001
ZOE, LET MOM AND I TALK
FOR A MINUTE, OKAY?

31:52.003 --> 31:54.069
BUT THEY'RE GONNA FIND US,
JUST LIKE OLIVE DREAMED.

31:54.071 --> 31:55.270
THEY'RE NOT
GONNA FIND US.
THEY MIGHT.

31:55.272 --> 31:57.138
CLAIRE, STOP.
STOP IT? STOP WHAT?

31:57.140 --> 31:58.539
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT THE HELL TO DO HERE, RAY.

31:58.541 --> 31:59.873
WE'RE NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING.

31:59.875 --> 32:01.374
EVEN IF THEY SEE
THE SMOKE --

32:01.376 --> 32:03.142
AND I DON'T THINK
THEY WILL --

32:03.144 --> 32:05.277
BY THE TIME THEY GET HERE,
IT'LL BE GONE.

32:05.279 --> 32:06.978
THEY'LL HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE IT CAME FROM.

32:06.980 --> 32:08.579
IT WON'T MATTER --
THEY'LL KNOW WE'RE HERE,

32:08.581 --> 32:10.113
AND THEY'LL SEARCH THE AREA
FOR US.

32:10.115 --> 32:11.514
SO LET THEM COME.

32:11.516 --> 32:14.450
THEY'VE SEARCHED HERE
A DOZEN TIMES BEFORE.

32:14.452 --> 32:16.351
THEY'VE NEVER FOUND US.

32:18.021 --> 32:20.121
AND THEY'RE NOT
GONNA FIND US<i> NOW.</i>

32:20.123 --> 32:21.455
DAD'S RIGHT.

32:21.457 --> 32:24.524
WE'RE STILL HIDDEN.
I CHECKED, REMEMBER?

32:24.526 --> 32:27.493
ALL AGREED WE'RE SAFE,
PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND.

32:28.595 --> 32:30.362
TWO AGAINST ONE.

32:30.364 --> 32:31.896
THREE.

32:49.280 --> 32:51.114
WHAT'S WRONG, MOM?

32:55.385 --> 32:57.419
THE WOOD'S BURNED.

32:57.421 --> 32:58.887
SO?

33:01.390 --> 33:05.159
SO BURNED WOOD
MAKES ASH.

33:14.501 --> 33:17.202
WE'RE NOT HIDDEN
ANYMORE...

33:17.204 --> 33:18.436
ARE WE?

33:18.438 --> 33:20.070
OH, I DON'T THINK
THEY'LL NOTICE.

33:20.072 --> 33:21.604
DO YOU REALLY
WANT TO TAKE THAT RISK?

33:21.606 --> 33:24.306
WE DON'T HAVE
ANOTHER CHOICE.

33:24.308 --> 33:25.607
WE COVER THE ASH.

33:25.609 --> 33:27.041
HOW?

33:27.043 --> 33:29.276
WE'D HAVE TO GO
ONTO THE SURFACE.

33:29.278 --> 33:32.145
BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE THIRD RULE?

33:32.147 --> 33:35.014
NEVER, EVER
OPEN THE DOOR.

33:35.016 --> 33:38.050
SOMETIMES RULES --

33:38.052 --> 33:40.118
EVEN MOM RULES --

33:40.120 --> 33:41.352
HAVE TO BE BROKEN.

33:44.989 --> 33:46.456
LISTEN TO ME.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.491
IF YOU HEAR ANYTHING UP THERE,
ANYTHING BUT ME AND DAD,

33:48.493 --> 33:50.560
I WANT YOU
TO LOCK THE DOOR BEHIND US.

33:50.562 --> 33:53.696
WHAT? NO, I'M GOING UP THERE
WITH YOU. I'M GONNA HELP.

33:53.698 --> 33:55.297
OUT OF THE QUESTION,
ZoZo.

33:55.299 --> 33:58.400
IT'S "ZOE."
STOP TREATING ME LIKE A BABY.

33:58.402 --> 34:00.068
I'M PROTECTING YOU.

34:00.070 --> 34:02.437
BUT WHAT IF
YOU NEED<i> ME</i> TO PROTECT<i> YOU?</i>

34:02.439 --> 34:03.805
I CAN FIGHT
IF I HAVE TO.

34:03.807 --> 34:06.073
NO, YOU CAN'T.
MY RULES STILL APPLY TO<i> YOU.</i>

34:06.075 --> 34:07.641
SO NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS
UP THERE,

34:07.643 --> 34:10.143
NO MATTER WHAT YOU HEAR,

34:10.145 --> 34:11.811
DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR.

34:11.813 --> 34:13.179
BUT...

34:13.181 --> 34:16.048
I NEED YOU
TO PROMISE ME THAT.

34:16.050 --> 34:17.516
PROMISE.

34:19.485 --> 34:21.419
PROMISE.

34:31.830 --> 34:33.529
WE'LL HAVE TO MOVE FAST.

34:33.531 --> 34:36.532
I DON'T WANNA BE OUT THERE
FOR MORE THAN THREE MINUTES.

34:36.534 --> 34:39.368
THREE MINUTES.

34:39.370 --> 34:41.403
OKAY.

35:12.464 --> 35:14.832
THEY'RE GOING THIS WAY, OLIVE.

35:14.834 --> 35:16.333
COME ON.

35:48.497 --> 35:50.631
NO. I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THEY WENT.

36:44.947 --> 36:46.814
IT'S JUST THEM, OLIVE.

36:46.816 --> 36:48.515
THEY'RE OKAY.

36:58.691 --> 37:00.358
MOM! DAD!

37:00.360 --> 37:02.693
LOOK OUT BEHIND YOU!

37:02.695 --> 37:05.362
MOM! DAD!

37:05.364 --> 37:06.629
HURRY!

37:40.559 --> 37:42.325
DAD!

37:45.228 --> 37:46.895
MOM! DAD!

37:52.500 --> 37:54.567
DAD!

37:54.569 --> 37:56.368
MOM!

37:56.370 --> 37:58.303
DAD!

37:59.806 --> 38:01.539
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

38:01.541 --> 38:03.440
I TOLD YOU
TO STAY INSIDE.

38:05.010 --> 38:06.576
SLOW DOWN.
WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOU.

38:06.578 --> 38:08.311
BREATHERS!

38:08.313 --> 38:09.345
LOOK OUT!

38:15.551 --> 38:17.618
IT'S JUST DEER, ZOE.

38:17.620 --> 38:20.420
NOTHING TO BE SCARED OF.

38:20.422 --> 38:21.888
JUST BAMBI.

38:23.390 --> 38:25.391
THEY LOOKED SCARED.

38:25.393 --> 38:26.825
AW, DON'T BE SILLY.

38:26.827 --> 38:29.994
SHE'S RIGHT, RAY.
THEY'RE RUNNING AWAY.

38:31.429 --> 38:33.563
RUNNING AWAY
FROM SOMETHING.

38:41.937 --> 38:44.805
WE HAVE TO
GET BACK IN THE SHELTER.

38:56.549 --> 38:57.749
CAREFUL.

39:42.691 --> 39:44.958
WHAT HAPPENED?
DID YOU SEE SOMETHING?

39:44.960 --> 39:46.859
Be quiet! Quiet.

39:54.699 --> 39:57.333
What is it, Dad?

40:00.671 --> 40:03.538
FOOTSTEPS.

40:18.986 --> 40:20.052
I THINK IT'S JUST ONE.

40:20.054 --> 40:21.553
WHY? WHY JUST ONE?

40:21.555 --> 40:23.121
THEY'VE ALWAYS TRAVELED
IN GROUPS BEFORE.

40:23.123 --> 40:25.723
I DON'T KNOW.

40:25.725 --> 40:28.125
MAYBE HE'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO SAW THE SMOKE.

40:31.796 --> 40:33.862
HE'S HEADED THIS WAY.

40:37.434 --> 40:39.100
ZoZo,
WE HAVE TO STAY QUIET.

40:39.102 --> 40:41.368
RULE NUMBER ONE, REMEMBER?
NEVER BE LOUD.

40:41.370 --> 40:43.703
I KNOW. I-I'M TRYING.

40:43.705 --> 40:44.737
Try harder.

40:46.574 --> 40:48.040
IF HE HEARS US,
HE WILL FIND US.

40:48.042 --> 40:49.775
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

40:49.777 --> 40:51.743
ZOE, ZOE, ZOE.

40:51.745 --> 40:53.878
ZOE, COME HERE.

40:53.880 --> 40:56.747
HAVE A SEAT.

40:59.451 --> 41:01.751
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GET OUT OF HERE?

41:01.753 --> 41:03.452
'CAUSE LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

41:03.454 --> 41:04.519
WITH THIS CAR...

41:06.855 --> 41:09.056
...YOU CAN GO
ANYWHERE YOU WANT.

41:09.058 --> 41:10.924
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

41:10.926 --> 41:12.558
ANY TIME.

41:14.561 --> 41:16.662
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO?

41:16.664 --> 41:18.630
MY BED.
YEAH?

41:18.632 --> 41:19.664
MY OLD BED.

41:19.666 --> 41:20.698
YEAH.

41:20.700 --> 41:23.400
THAT'S
AN EXCELLENT CHOICE.

41:23.402 --> 41:25.602
OKAY. OKAY.

41:29.007 --> 41:31.507
KA-PLOP.

41:31.509 --> 41:34.409
YOU COLLAPSE
ON YOUR BED...

41:34.411 --> 41:37.912
EXHAUSTED
AFTER A LONG DAY.

41:37.914 --> 41:40.981
AND YOU PULL
THOSE WARM PINK POLKA DOT SHEETS

41:40.983 --> 41:43.583
ALL THE WAY
UP TO YOUR EYES.

41:47.988 --> 41:50.789
YOU HUG
ALL YOUR STUFFED ANIMALS.

41:52.658 --> 41:58.095
PUFFY BEAR, DUCK DUCK,
CATHYPILLAR.

41:58.097 --> 42:00.163
KISSING THEM GOOD NIGHT.

42:08.738 --> 42:11.005
YOU CAN FEEL THE FAN
ON YOUR NIGHTSTAND

42:11.007 --> 42:14.074
BLOWING A SOFT BREEZE
THROUGH YOUR HAIR.

42:20.914 --> 42:24.616
AND THEN YOU LOOK UP
AT THE CEILING ABOVE YOU,

42:24.618 --> 42:27.751
WHERE WE HUNG
THOSE GLOW-IN-THE-DARK STARS...

42:29.820 --> 42:32.755
...AND THEY SHINE FOR YOU.

42:32.757 --> 42:36.225
SO THERE'S ALWAYS LIGHT...

42:36.227 --> 42:38.560
EVEN WHEN YOU SLEEP.

42:41.564 --> 42:43.665
EVEN WHEN YOU DREAM.

42:49.704 --> 42:51.604
ARE YOU THERE?

42:53.239 --> 42:55.240
YEAH.

42:55.242 --> 42:57.241
I'M THERE.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.744
CAN YOU SEE THE STARS?

43:07.584 --> 43:09.050
MM.

43:44.049 --> 43:47.217
Let it go,
let it go.

45:11.158 --> 45:14.160
<i> MY SMILE IS STUCK.</i>

45:14.162 --> 45:16.462

45:43.351 --> 45:45.251
NO.

45:45.253 --> 45:48.020
PLEASE. PLEASE FIT IN.

46:03.835 --> 46:06.002
HE CAN'T GET IN HERE,
CAN HE?

46:08.372 --> 46:10.339
HOLD FAST,
RIGHT, DAD?

46:19.047 --> 46:20.313
HE'S TOO STRONG!

46:23.050 --> 46:25.049
WE NEED SOMETHING
TO BRACE THE DOOR!

46:27.419 --> 46:28.952
SOMETHING TOUGH.

46:28.954 --> 46:31.287
GO! GO!

46:43.232 --> 46:44.332
MOM,
YOU CAN'T GO UP THERE!

46:44.334 --> 46:45.499

48:24.342 --> 48:25.341
OKAY?

48:26.410 --> 48:27.409
OKAY.

48:28.578 --> 48:29.944
HEY.

49:30.064 --> 49:32.298
HE'S STILL UP THERE.

49:32.300 --> 49:34.533
WHY ISN'T HE LEAVING?

49:34.535 --> 49:38.069
WHY WON'T HE JUST
GO AWAY?

49:38.071 --> 49:39.904
I DON'T KNOW.

49:44.275 --> 49:47.277
HE'S UP TO SOMETHING.

49:47.279 --> 49:50.580
What could he be up to?

49:50.582 --> 49:53.382
Why is he still
standing there?

50:30.416 --> 50:32.315
<i> THAT'S</i> WHAT HE'S DOING.

WAITING FOR WHAT?

50:38.189 --> 50:39.955
THE REST OF THEM.

51:22.529 --> 51:24.096
HEY, LOOK, ZOE,
THERE IT IS.

51:24.098 --> 51:26.431
THE WATER TOWER OVER THERE --
YOU SEE IT?

51:28.500 --> 51:30.334
SO ONCE WE'RE PAST THAT,
WE'RE OUT OF KINGSVILLE.

51:30.336 --> 51:33.170

SAFE FROM THE SICK PEOPLE?

51:33.172 --> 51:35.572
THAT'S RIGHT, SWEETIE.
SAFE FROM THE SICK PEOPLE.

51:53.621 --> 51:55.153

HEADED BACK?

51:55.155 --> 51:57.021
I DON'T KNOW.

51:58.223 --> 52:00.257
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
WE COULDN'T STAY,

52:00.259 --> 52:02.158
THAT IT WAS DANGEROUS.

52:02.160 --> 52:03.559
MAYBE
EVERYTHING'S OKAY NOW.

52:03.561 --> 52:05.193
YOU THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE?

52:05.195 --> 52:06.427
I DON'T KNOW.

THAT I WOULD PROTECT YOU!
NO! NO!

58:13.549 --> 58:15.682
I PROMISED HIM
THAT I WOULD PROTECT YOU!
I DON'T CARE!

58:15.684 --> 58:16.683
I PROMISED HIM!

58:16.685 --> 58:17.717

59:46.922 --> 59:48.689
WHAT DO WE DO?!

59:48.691 --> 59:50.590
RUN! KEEP RUNNING!

1:00:05.870 --> 1:00:07.871
THE BREATHERS!
THEY'RE COMING!

1:00:18.581 --> 1:00:20.382
SHE DREAMED
THEY FOUND US.

1:00:24.153 --> 1:00:25.887
THEY'RE STILL
LOOKING FOR US.

1:00:31.759 --> 1:00:33.159
THEY HATE US A LOT,
DON'T THEY?

1:00:33.161 --> 1:00:35.060
TO KEEP HUNTING US
LIKE THAT.

1:00:35.062 --> 1:00:36.961
THEY'VE ALWAYS
TRAVELED IN GROUPS BEFORE.

1:00:36.963 --> 1:00:38.295
YEAH, WELL,
I CAN FIGHT THEM.

1:00:38.297 --> 1:00:39.696
THAT'S SUICIDE,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

1:00:39.698 --> 1:00:40.897
WHAT'S
A "CORE AND TINE"?

1:00:40.899 --> 1:00:42.031
IT MEANS
THEY'RE NOT LETTING US OUT.

1:00:42.033 --> 1:00:44.299
The Breathers.

1:01:17.098 --> 1:01:18.864
LET US GO!

1:01:19.900 --> 1:01:20.932
LET US GO!

1:01:23.803 --> 1:01:25.769
LET US GO!
LET US OUT!

1:01:25.771 --> 1:01:27.203
NO!

1:01:49.322 --> 1:01:53.057
MOM,
IT'S AN EARTHQUAKE.

1:01:53.059 --> 1:01:56.226
NO, SWEETIE,
IT CAN'T BE.

1:01:56.228 --> 1:01:58.695
KINGSVILLE
DOESN'T HAVE EARTHQUAKES.

1:02:10.041 --> 1:02:12.775
WHY THE HELL
DOES THE CDC NEED MILITARY JETS?

1:02:12.777 --> 1:02:14.276
THEY'RE TURNING AROUND.

1:02:27.088 --> 1:02:30.790
THEY JUST TOLD EVERYONE
TO GO BACK INTO TOWN.

1:02:32.093 --> 1:02:33.926
MOM, DAD,
THEY'RE COMING!

1:02:37.197 --> 1:02:39.263
COME ON!
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE!

1:02:39.265 --> 1:02:40.497
COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON!

1:02:40.499 --> 1:02:41.931
NO, NO, NO!
TOO FAR TO WALK THERE!

1:02:48.470 --> 1:02:50.804
KINGSVILLE ELEMENTARY!
WHAT?!

1:02:50.806 --> 1:02:52.338
THERE'S A FALLOUT SHELTER
OUT BACK!

1:02:52.340 --> 1:02:53.739
BUT I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S SAFE.

1:02:53.741 --> 1:02:55.507
WELL, IT'S SAFER THAN HERE.
COME ON.

1:02:55.509 --> 1:02:57.174

1:03:07.349 --> 1:03:09.483

1:04:09.230 --> 1:04:12.232
YEAH, I'M OKAY.

1:04:12.234 --> 1:04:13.266
ARE YOU GUYS?

1:04:13.268 --> 1:04:14.533
YEAH.

1:04:14.535 --> 1:04:16.368
YEAH, WE'RE --

1:04:16.370 --> 1:04:17.402
WE'RE OKAY.

1:04:17.404 --> 1:04:19.404
WE'RE OKAY.

1:04:38.486 --> 1:04:40.320
OHH.

1:04:42.289 --> 1:04:45.057
OH, THEY HAVE
EVERYTHING HERE.

1:04:53.966 --> 1:04:55.967
LOOK AT ALL THIS FOOD.

1:05:02.340 --> 1:05:04.541
HEY, ZOE.

1:05:06.944 --> 1:05:08.844
LOOK AT ALL THIS.

1:05:10.847 --> 1:05:12.246
HUH?

1:05:15.617 --> 1:05:17.618
THERE'S...

1:05:17.620 --> 1:05:19.886
THERE'S BOOKS AND GAMES AND...

1:05:19.888 --> 1:05:21.053
HEY, DAD?

1:05:21.055 --> 1:05:22.220
...MORE TOYS, THAT --

1:05:22.222 --> 1:05:23.621
YE -- YEAH?

1:05:25.991 --> 1:05:28.191
HOW LONG
DO WE HAVE TO STAY HERE?

1:05:31.161 --> 1:05:35.030
I -- I DON'T KNOW.

1:05:35.032 --> 1:05:38.533
NOT --
HOPEFULLY NOT VERY LONG.

1:05:38.535 --> 1:05:41.302
W-WE JUST GOT TO WAIT
TILL THEY CLEAR THIS UP.

1:05:41.304 --> 1:05:42.603
AND THEN...

1:05:44.539 --> 1:05:46.606
HONEY, W--

1:05:46.608 --> 1:05:50.176
WHAT HAPPENED UP THERE
WAS A MISTAKE.

1:05:50.178 --> 1:05:54.647
IT'S A TERRIBLE,
T-TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

1:05:54.649 --> 1:05:57.049
IT WASN'T A MISTAKE.

1:06:01.420 --> 1:06:03.654
THE SHELTER DOOR CUT ME.

1:06:05.391 --> 1:06:08.392
THE VIRUS
MUST HAVE GONE AIRBORNE.

1:06:08.394 --> 1:06:10.193
WE'RE INFECTED.

1:06:27.241 --> 1:06:28.574
PLEASE, JUST LET US GO.

1:06:28.576 --> 1:06:30.542
NO!
JUST LET US GO.

1:06:30.544 --> 1:06:32.277
YOU COOPERATE,
ANSWER MY QUESTIONS,

1:06:32.279 --> 1:06:34.245
I'LL DO WHAT I CAN
TO HELP YOU AND YOUR DAUGHTER.

1:06:34.247 --> 1:06:35.279
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

1:06:35.281 --> 1:06:37.381
YES, YES.

1:06:37.383 --> 1:06:39.583
THAT SHELTER WE FOUND YOU IN.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN THERE?

1:06:39.585 --> 1:06:41.284
SINCE THE BEGINNING.

1:06:41.286 --> 1:06:43.152
DID YOU EVER COME INTO CONTACT
WITH ANYONE ELSE?

1:06:43.154 --> 1:06:44.486
FAMILY? NEIGHBORS?
IT WAS ONLY US.

1:06:44.488 --> 1:06:47.121
DAD SAYS
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES LEFT.

1:06:48.189 --> 1:06:49.956
"ZOE."

1:06:49.958 --> 1:06:54.359
I HAVE A LITTLE GIRL
ABOUT YOUR AGE.

1:06:54.361 --> 1:06:57.095
GODDAMN SHAME.

1:07:00.499 --> 1:07:02.165
NO!

1:07:02.167 --> 1:07:04.367
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU SAID YOU WOULD HELP US.

1:07:04.369 --> 1:07:06.602
ON MY ORDER.
I WON'T LET YOU
TOUCH HER.

1:07:06.604 --> 1:07:08.337
I WON'T LET YOU
TOUCH HER!

1:07:08.339 --> 1:07:09.438
I WILL NOT LET YOU
TOUCH HER!

1:07:09.440 --> 1:07:10.572
I WON'T LET YOU
TOUCH HER!

1:07:10.574 --> 1:07:12.140
I WILL NOT LET YOU
TOUCH HER!

1:07:12.142 --> 1:07:13.207
I WILL NOT LET YOU
TOUCH HER!

1:07:13.209 --> 1:07:14.308
MOM, NEVER LOSE CONTROL!

1:07:14.310 --> 1:07:16.109
KEEP AWAY!
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS!

1:07:16.111 --> 1:07:17.944
KEEP AWAY, KEEP AWAY,
KEEP AWAY!

1:07:17.946 --> 1:07:19.578
REMEMBER RULE NUMBER TWO --
NEVER LOSE CONTROL.

1:07:19.580 --> 1:07:21.313
Keep away.

1:07:23.183 --> 1:07:24.615
DON'T FORGET RULE TWO,
CLAIRE.

1:07:24.617 --> 1:07:26.416
NO MATTER WHAT,
WE HAVE TO STAY UNDER CONTROL.

1:07:26.418 --> 1:07:28.117
WE HAVE TO STAY CALM.

1:07:28.119 --> 1:07:29.585
NEVER LET ANGER TAKE OVER.

1:07:29.587 --> 1:07:31.987
NO, NO, NO!

1:07:31.989 --> 1:07:33.621
THEY'RE DIFFERENT THAN WE ARE,
AND THAT MAKES THEM

1:07:33.623 --> 1:07:35.122
AS SCARED OF US
AS WE ARE OF THEM.

1:07:35.124 --> 1:07:36.723
WE'RE NOT ANIMALS.

1:07:36.725 --> 1:07:38.458
SOMETIMES
THE TRUTH'S HIDDEN FROM US.

1:07:59.277 --> 1:08:01.076
DADDY!
LET ME GO! HELP!

1:08:01.078 --> 1:08:02.444
COME ON!

1:08:03.680 --> 1:08:05.179

RUN! MOMMY!

1:10:17.355 --> 1:10:19.322

1:10:19.324 --> 1:10:21.357
YOU DON'T HAVE TO KILL HIM.
IT'S OKAY.

1:10:21.359 --> 1:10:22.725
WE'RE SA--

1:10:22.727 --> 1:10:24.460
AAH!

1:10:25.830 --> 1:10:27.763

CAREFUL.

1:11:12.662 --> 1:11:13.795
YOU'RE HURT.
