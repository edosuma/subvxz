00:01.400 --> 00:04.324
KELLY ANNE: Previously on
Queen of the South...

00:04.370 --> 00:05.291
TERESA: We're selling
to Dumas now.

00:05.330 --> 00:06.228
That was his ransom.

00:06.270 --> 00:08.067
Find out who he is.

00:08.100 --> 00:09.863
I know you like to do things
all peaceful in the States.

00:09.910 --> 00:11.309
BOAZ: But in Sinaloa we
don't kill with kindness.

00:11.340 --> 00:12.830
We just kill.

00:12.880 --> 00:15.178
POTE: Javier Jimenez,
he's the leader

00:15.210 --> 00:16.700
of the Death Squad
out of Juarez.

00:16.750 --> 00:17.739
(grunts)

00:17.780 --> 00:19.077
I'm Judge Cecil Lafayette.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.542
Am I under arrest?

00:20.580 --> 00:22.480
To run a--a lpusiness
In my City,

00:22.520 --> 00:24.215
you need to pay taxes.

00:24.250 --> 00:28.311
And those--those taxes shall be
remitted to yours truly.

00:28.360 --> 00:31.329
(suspenseful music)

00:31.360 --> 00:32.918
*

00:32.960 --> 00:34.325
(grunts)

00:34.360 --> 00:35.258
KELLY ANNE: Let's go.

00:35.300 --> 00:36.767
(grunts)

00:36.800 --> 00:37.892
-You're supposed to be dead.
-I know, I know.

00:37.930 --> 00:39.693
Please let me explain.

00:39.740 --> 00:43.608
If Teresa still wants me dead,
I'm at peace with that.

00:44.710 --> 00:47.679
(dramatic music)

00:47.710 --> 00:54.718
*

01:01.160 --> 01:04.027
DUMAS: That's impressive.

01:04.060 --> 01:05.687
Why not just sell us the powder?

01:05.730 --> 01:08.028
Because I don't
move it that way.

01:08.060 --> 01:08.958
And the purity?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.399
98%.

01:10.430 --> 01:13.433
Javier will be your contact.

01:13.470 --> 01:14.937
You and I won't
be meeting again.

01:14.970 --> 01:17.530
I'll say this once.

01:17.570 --> 01:19.879
You know who we are.

01:19.910 --> 01:22.708
You wanted our attention.

01:22.750 --> 01:23.876
Now you have it.

01:23.910 --> 01:28.017
*

01:30.520 --> 01:33.978
*

01:34.020 --> 01:37.023
(cell phone vibrates)

01:38.330 --> 01:40.127
You're a hard man
to get ahold of.

01:40.160 --> 01:42.219
TERESA: I was expecting
a call days ago.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.397
My sincerest apologies.

01:44.430 --> 01:46.432
The market's been
on a roller coaster.

01:46.470 --> 01:48.961
I made an offer
on that trucking company.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.662
We discussed using funds from
the Turks and Caicos accounts.

01:51.710 --> 01:53.974
Unfortunately,
that won't be possible.

01:54.010 --> 01:56.899
There's an ongoing
fraud investigation.

01:56.950 --> 02:00.113
It won't affect you,
but it could be a few months

02:00.150 --> 02:02.311
before I safely
can access those accounts.

02:02.350 --> 02:06.684
Dieter, is there a problem
with my money?

02:06.720 --> 02:08.950
DIETER: No, no.

02:08.990 --> 02:10.628
Those audits
won't affect you.

02:10.660 --> 02:14.027
But they will tie up those
funds temporarily.

02:14.060 --> 02:16.324
I'm purchasing
this trucking company,

02:16.370 --> 02:18.759
and I can't hand them
bags of cash.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.597
The sale must be legitimate.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.267
TERESA:
I need this trucking company

02:22.310 --> 02:23.834
to continue to grow
the NOLA operation.

02:23.870 --> 02:25.963
I will move some assets around.

02:26.010 --> 02:27.932
That should give you
what you need

02:27.980 --> 02:30.448
without raising any red flags.

02:30.480 --> 02:32.107
Let me know when it's done.

02:32.150 --> 02:33.378
DIETER: Of course.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.376
You want me to get on a plane?

02:35.420 --> 02:37.547
Not yet.

02:37.590 --> 02:38.784
Let's wait and see.

02:38.820 --> 02:41.789
(suspenseful music)

02:41.820 --> 02:45.881
*

02:45.930 --> 02:51.368
Listen, I know you have
every reason to walk away

02:51.400 --> 02:52.867
after what happened.

02:54.440 --> 02:55.896
I'm glad you're still here.

02:58.340 --> 03:02.379
Well, every bar
that I ever worked in,

03:02.410 --> 03:04.799
my bosses have always been men.

03:04.850 --> 03:06.511
I knew what I was to them.

03:06.550 --> 03:09.587
Eye candy, nothing more.

03:09.620 --> 03:11.747
Even as I built up
their business.

03:11.790 --> 03:12.916
But, um...

03:15.020 --> 03:16.351
I don't know.
You're different.

03:17.590 --> 03:20.354
And I believe in
what this bar could be.

03:21.960 --> 03:25.669
So that other stuff,

03:25.700 --> 03:27.463
it's your business.

03:29.940 --> 03:33.273
Well, are you ready
to open the doors?

03:33.310 --> 03:35.574
Oh, yes.

03:35.610 --> 03:37.339
-(|aughs)
-So nervous.

03:37.380 --> 03:38.506
Let's do it.

03:38.550 --> 03:40.074
Okay, let's go.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.371
(laughs)

03:41.420 --> 03:43.843
(indistinct chatter)

03:43.890 --> 03:46.859
(both speaking Spanish)

03:46.890 --> 03:49.358
Listen, I'm heading
to Pote's house.

03:49.390 --> 03:50.687
He should be
getting in with Tony.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.391
I'll come with you.

03:52.430 --> 03:55.058
No, stay here and make sure
everything runs smoothly.

03:55.100 --> 03:57.068
_ We'll come back
In a couple of hours.

03:57.100 --> 03:58.397
Mmm.

03:58.430 --> 03:59.533
-I'll see you soon.
-Hey.

03:59.570 --> 04:02.630
(Spanish music playing)

04:02.670 --> 04:04.661
(doorbell rings)

04:08.610 --> 04:10.475
-TERESA: Hey.
-Hey.

04:10.510 --> 04:13.115
-Como_ estas?
-BIen.

04:13.150 --> 04:14.412
Gracias.

04:15.580 --> 04:18.140
-Siempre.
-Where's Tony?

04:18.190 --> 04:22.115
Teresita, there's something
that you should know.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.378
I wanted to tell you in person.

04:24.430 --> 04:25.624
I didn't want to say
it over the--

04:25.660 --> 04:28.128
-TONY: Teresa.
-TERESA: Tony.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.491
TERESA: Oy.

04:31.430 --> 04:33.864
-How are you?
-Doing good.

04:35.340 --> 04:37.228
I'm so sorry about
what happened.

04:37.270 --> 04:39.431
It's not your fault.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.979
You're so big.

04:44.650 --> 04:46.106
What's that?

04:46.150 --> 04:48.118
Oh, um, I'm making
my own graphic novel.

04:48.150 --> 04:50.983
Whatever you do,
don't call it a comic book.

04:51.020 --> 04:53.284
-He goes crazy.
-(chuckles)

04:54.660 --> 04:56.480
I missed you.

04:56.530 --> 04:57.622
I missed you too.

04:59.190 --> 05:01.556
Am I going home with you now,
or...

05:02.570 --> 05:03.923
Not yet.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.494
We're gonna figure that out.

05:05.530 --> 05:08.761
But I want you to know
that you're safe here, okay?

05:08.800 --> 05:10.233
-Okay.
-Teresita.

05:12.210 --> 05:14.075
POTE: I really need
to tell you something.

05:15.480 --> 05:16.947
KELLY ANNE:
Hey, Teresa.

05:16.980 --> 05:19.949
(suspenseful music)

05:19.980 --> 05:26.988
*

05:36.570 --> 05:38.219
-Did you know she was alive?
-No.

05:38.270 --> 05:39.669
I was as surprised as you.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.035
How, Pote?

05:43.070 --> 05:44.537
-How did this happen?
-James.

05:44.570 --> 05:46.162
She said James let her go.

05:46.210 --> 05:47.905
What do you mean,
James let her go?

05:47.940 --> 05:49.407
Where were you?

05:49.450 --> 05:51.702
He told me to walk away,
that he will do it.

05:51.750 --> 05:53.047
I heard the shot.

05:55.250 --> 05:56.808
Look, Teresita.

05:56.850 --> 05:59.410
Kelly Anne saved Tony's life.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.416
She could have stayed dead,

06:01.460 --> 06:04.088
but she took a risk because
she knew Tony was in trouble.

06:04.130 --> 06:06.223
And I'm not defending her.

06:06.260 --> 06:07.955
I'm just letting you know
what happened.

06:12.030 --> 06:14.169
Who sent them?

06:14.200 --> 06:15.360
It wasn't Camila.

06:15.400 --> 06:19.006
No, it was Cortez.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.429
He had the ball rolling
right before we killed him.

06:21.480 --> 06:24.005
-Are the sicarios dead?
-One of them is.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.642
I couldn't find the body
of the second one.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.212
What do you want me
to do with her?

06:31.250 --> 06:32.478
I don't know.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.219
We need_to meet with
the trucking company.

06:37.260 --> 06:38.454
I'll deal with her later.

06:40.730 --> 06:42.254
Tell Manny to stay with them.

06:43.130 --> 06:44.290
(speaks Spanish)

06:47.770 --> 06:49.169
Pote.

06:50.740 --> 06:52.970
You and Tony
are safe here tonight.

06:53.780 --> 06:56.749
(jazz music playing)

06:56.780 --> 06:59.101
*

06:59.150 --> 07:01.072
From our new Mexican friend.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.883
*

07:02.920 --> 07:05.980
Be interesting to see
how she does is this town.

07:06.020 --> 07:07.419
*

07:07.460 --> 07:09.587
Ren.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.154
Thought I heard you in here.

07:11.190 --> 07:12.623
What up, cuz?

07:12.660 --> 07:14.150
*

07:14.200 --> 07:16.498
Ren and his buddy gonna
grab a few drinks.

07:16.530 --> 07:17.827
LAFAYETTE: Do the town.

07:17.870 --> 07:19.565
Why don't you join us, Davis?

07:19.600 --> 07:22.262
*

07:22.300 --> 07:23.801
LAFAYETTE: Go on, son.

07:23.840 --> 07:26.729
Have a good time.
The night belongs to the young.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.408
*

07:29.440 --> 07:32.341
All right.
Guess so.

07:32.380 --> 07:36.419
Just, uh, text me where you end
up and I'll meet you there?

07:36.450 --> 07:41.285
*

07:41.320 --> 07:42.480
RENE: See you in a bit.

07:42.530 --> 07:45.624
*

07:45.660 --> 07:46.592
How's he doing?

07:46.630 --> 07:48.518
*

07:48.560 --> 07:52.121
Honestly?
I'm worried.

07:52.170 --> 07:53.762
Ever since he came back
from the hospital,

07:53.800 --> 07:55.358
he hasn't been right.

07:55.400 --> 07:58.267
They changed his medication
and now he wanders

07:58.310 --> 08:00.528
around the house
like a damned zombie.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.639
*

08:02.680 --> 08:04.841
(truck engine turning over)

08:04.880 --> 08:08.873
Miss Mendoza, my wife and I
built this company together,

08:08.920 --> 08:11.218
put our heart and soul
into it.

08:11.250 --> 08:14.014
30-plus years.

08:14.060 --> 08:16.722
It's no small thing,
turning it over to strangers.

08:16.760 --> 08:20.196
I understand it must be
really difficult.

08:20.230 --> 08:22.221
But you're still interested
in selling, right?

08:22.260 --> 08:24.467
We discussed _it.
We want to retire.

08:24.500 --> 08:28.163
We're ready to sell.
But we have a problem.

08:32.840 --> 08:34.501
What problem?

08:34.540 --> 08:36.906
We hit a rough patch
a few years back.

08:38.010 --> 08:41.468
IRS hit us with a lean.
I needed some fast cash.

08:41.520 --> 08:45.012
So I went to a, um,
private lender.

08:45.050 --> 08:47.518
Honey, for God's sake.
Call the man what he is.

08:47.560 --> 08:48.913
He's a loan shark.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.825
FRANK: Abby, take it easy.

08:50.860 --> 08:53.749
This man fronted us money
but at an insane interest rate.

08:53.800 --> 08:57.167
Now, on top of that,
he's claiming a 30% stake

08:57.200 --> 08:58.963
in the company.

09:00.100 --> 09:01.397
What's his name?

09:01.440 --> 09:04.034
(suspenseful music)

09:04.070 --> 09:05.537
JoelBouchen

09:05.570 --> 09:07.401
*

09:07.440 --> 09:10.079
I don't care who you is.

09:10.110 --> 09:12.271
Salerno Transport not for sale.

09:12.310 --> 09:14.676
I think you would like
to hear my offer.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.883
Can you meet tonight?

09:17.920 --> 09:19.444
Sure, why not?

09:19.490 --> 09:21.788
You done got my curiosity up,
chen

09:21.820 --> 09:28.089
*

09:28.130 --> 09:29.859
BOUCHER: Change of plan.

09:29.900 --> 09:32.460
We're gonna make a stop first.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.036
It shouldn't take too long.

09:34.070 --> 09:37.233
*

09:37.270 --> 09:39.409
There are other
trucking companies.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.374
POTE: I think this one
is gonna be too much trouble.

09:41.410 --> 09:43.378
This one is a small,
independent company

09:43.410 --> 09:46.243
with established shipping routes
all the way to New York.

09:46.280 --> 09:48.748
It's perfect for what we need.

09:48.780 --> 09:50.111
TERESA: With the
bigger companies,

09:50.150 --> 09:52.812
there would be
too many questions.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.816
We need this.

09:54.860 --> 09:58.728
Are we gonna talk about
what to do with Kelly Anne?

09:58.760 --> 10:00.159
She betrayed us, Pote.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.088
I know that.

10:02.130 --> 10:03.620
You want her gone.

10:03.670 --> 10:05.126
*

10:05.170 --> 10:07.468
(engine turns over,
car starts)

10:07.500 --> 10:11.061
*

10:11.110 --> 10:12.463
Hey, girl.
How's it going?

10:12.510 --> 10:14.307
BIRDIE: Hey.
Yeah, it's good.

10:14.340 --> 10:16.308
_We haven't slowed down
smce we opened the doors.

10:16.340 --> 10:18.843
We made, like, 20 Teresitas
in the last hour.

10:18.880 --> 10:21.178
JAVIER: Teresa.
How did it go?

10:21.220 --> 10:22.448
MAN: Sir, hey, excuse me, sir.

10:22.480 --> 10:24.414
It's complicated.
The couple--

10:24.450 --> 10:25.917
BOAZ: (speaking Spanish)

10:25.950 --> 10:28.180
-MAN: You have to calm down.
-Don't touch me.

10:28.220 --> 10:29.926
TERESA: What is Boaz doing here?

10:29.960 --> 10:30.984
I have no idea.

10:31.030 --> 10:33.851
(upbeat music playing)

10:33.900 --> 10:35.424
*

10:35.460 --> 10:37.325
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
It's okay.

10:37.370 --> 10:38.325
It's okay, we know him.

10:38.370 --> 10:40.292
He's got a gun in that box.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.194
It's not even loaded, pendejo.
It's a showpiece for Teresa.

10:42.240 --> 10:45.209
-(Javier speaking Spanish)
-Pendejo.

10:45.240 --> 10:46.673
(speaking Spanish)

10:48.140 --> 10:50.279
What are you doing here, Boaz?

10:50.310 --> 10:52.278
Just here on vacation.

10:52.310 --> 10:54.346
Here to recharge the batteries.

10:54.380 --> 10:55.847
Take a look at your gift.

10:55.880 --> 10:57.347
*

10:57.390 --> 10:58.789
-Hey, Birdie.
-BIRDIE: Yeah.

10:58.820 --> 11:00.310
Can you help me with this?

11:00.360 --> 11:04.023
*

11:04.060 --> 11:07.826
Javier, why don't you show Boaz
the VIP area?

11:07.860 --> 11:09.964
Have a drink. Relax.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.366
Yes, I'd like to clear
the air between us.

11:14.700 --> 11:17.669
Have that drink
and we'll talk later, okay?

11:17.710 --> 11:19.701
*

11:19.740 --> 11:21.230
Very nice place, Teresa.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.248
BOAZ: (speaking Spanish)

11:23.280 --> 11:27.740
*

11:27.780 --> 11:28.849
Boaz?

11:30.450 --> 11:32.418
-(|aughing)
-WOMAN: Salud.

11:33.890 --> 11:36.381
No idea.
Is Boucher her?

11:38.460 --> 11:41.497
Pinche loco,
smells and looks like trouble.

11:41.530 --> 11:43.691
Thank he has a nose full too.

11:43.730 --> 11:45.027
Did you get the money
out of the safe?

11:45.070 --> 11:46.059
It's ready.

11:46.100 --> 11:47.397
Do you want me to get Javier?

11:47.440 --> 11:50.034
No, I need him
to keep Boaz busy.

11:50.070 --> 11:55.269
*

11:55.310 --> 11:57.949
Mr. Boucher?
Thank you for meeting me.

11:57.980 --> 11:59.504
*

11:59.550 --> 12:00.847
Where's the worm?

12:00.880 --> 12:03.713
*

12:03.750 --> 12:05.615
It's true.

12:05.650 --> 12:08.414
If you swallow it,
you get to see visions.

12:08.460 --> 12:12.521
That's mezcal,
and I wouldn't know.

12:12.560 --> 12:13.788
Ah.

12:13.830 --> 12:16.890
*

12:16.930 --> 12:18.727
(laughs)

12:18.770 --> 12:20.795
*

12:22.670 --> 12:25.935
It's everything the Salernos
owe you, plus your interest.

12:25.970 --> 12:30.100
I'm paying off
their debt in full.

12:30.150 --> 12:33.039
Well, you wanna
buy out the Salernos?

12:33.080 --> 12:34.775
That's fine.

12:34.820 --> 12:36.617
But you get me as a partner.

12:36.650 --> 12:39.084
(percussive music playing)

12:39.120 --> 12:40.451
I don't need a partner.

12:40.490 --> 12:42.583
*

12:42.620 --> 12:44.952
Well, then,

12:44.990 --> 12:48.221
I suppose there's
option number two.

12:48.260 --> 12:50.467
Your pretty little
self get lost,

12:50.500 --> 12:51.922
and I take the whole company.

12:51.970 --> 12:54.461
I got a third option for you,
cabron.

12:54.500 --> 13:01.474
*

13:01.510 --> 13:03.102
Mr. Boucher.

13:03.150 --> 13:05.106
*

13:05.150 --> 13:08.472
I'm offering you a lot of money
just to step away.

13:08.520 --> 13:11.910
But when you're gone,
you stay gone.

13:11.950 --> 13:14.453
*

13:14.490 --> 13:20.292
(laughing)

13:20.330 --> 13:22.924
You're a funny girl.

13:22.970 --> 13:27.430
Oh, Salerno Transport

13:27.470 --> 13:28.994
is a graw train.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.667
(suspenseful music)

13:30.710 --> 13:33.008
And I'm nowhere near done
riding her yet.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.201
Then I think we have a problem.

13:35.240 --> 13:39.506
Wait, I don't think
you realize where you is.

13:39.550 --> 13:41.814
And this--
this ain't no Mejico.

13:41.850 --> 13:43.340
*

13:43.390 --> 13:46.518
Yeah, this ain't even America.

13:46.550 --> 13:47.551
This here...

13:47.590 --> 13:50.957
(knocking)

13:50.990 --> 13:53.151
This New Orleans.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.351
And we got our own way
to do things down here, cher.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.992
(chuckles)

13:58.030 --> 14:01.636
See, the people
I'm connected to,

14:01.670 --> 14:04.161
the buttons I can push...

14:04.210 --> 14:05.666
*

14:05.710 --> 14:07.337
You don't even wanna know.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.247
*

14:10.280 --> 14:11.804
(chuckles)

14:11.850 --> 14:18.847
*

14:19.620 --> 14:21.485
I got me one of them, too, beb.

14:21.520 --> 14:24.921
(mimics clicking noises)

14:24.960 --> 14:27.326
BOUCHER: Oh,

14:27.360 --> 14:30.818
I think I'm gonna be
seeing you around.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.895
You done got my interest now,
chen

14:32.940 --> 14:37.604
*

14:37.640 --> 14:39.062
(hocking)

14:39.110 --> 14:46.107
*

14:51.150 --> 14:53.516
(laughing)

14:53.560 --> 14:55.755
*

14:55.790 --> 15:00.124
-BOUCHER: (laughing)
-Let me take him tonight.

15:00.160 --> 15:01.593
No.

15:01.630 --> 15:03.928
*

15:03.970 --> 15:05.267
We'll find a way.

15:05.300 --> 15:07.860
We might not have a choice.

15:07.900 --> 15:11.267
I think we just kicked the
hornet's nest with this cabron.

15:11.310 --> 15:14.108
*

15:19.250 --> 15:22.310
(blows landing)
(both grunting)

15:22.350 --> 15:24.443
(shouting)

15:24.490 --> 15:27.459
(suspenseful music)

15:27.490 --> 15:30.948
*

15:30.990 --> 15:34.118
You bring those Mexicans
into our business.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.889
BOUCHER: You think you gonna
chase me out, Frank?

15:35.930 --> 15:40.936
*

15:40.970 --> 15:42.460
(glass shattering)

15:42.500 --> 15:44.809
(woman screams)

15:44.840 --> 15:50.449
*

15:50.480 --> 15:52.141
Hey, Tony.

15:52.180 --> 15:55.069
Listen, I wanted
to get back tonight,

15:55.120 --> 15:58.283
but it's getting late
and you had a long day.

15:58.320 --> 16:01.016
Why don't you rest a bit
and I'll see you tomorrow?

16:03.230 --> 16:05.790
Great.
Have a good night.

16:05.830 --> 16:07.092
Bye.

16:07.130 --> 16:08.757
How is he?

16:08.800 --> 16:10.620
He's trying to be brave.

16:12.370 --> 16:13.735
He's scared.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.392
He feels safe with Kelly Anne.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.598
EDDIE: Thank you, everybody,
for joining us here

16:22.640 --> 16:25.302
at Siete Gotas.

16:25.350 --> 16:26.374
Did I pronounce that right?

16:26.410 --> 16:27.672
What's wrong?

16:27.720 --> 16:29.813
-(cheers and applause)
-Teresa?

16:29.850 --> 16:31.681
All right!

16:31.720 --> 16:34.689
(jazz music playing)

16:34.720 --> 16:41.728
*

16:48.200 --> 16:51.203
Why didn't you tell me you
were playing here tonight?

16:51.240 --> 16:54.175
When Birdie called,
I figured it was your idea.

16:54.210 --> 16:57.873
But of course it wasn't
because this IS your bar

16:57.910 --> 17:01.038
and now it's awkward.

17:01.080 --> 17:04.208
(both laughing)

17:04.250 --> 17:06.844
It's okay.

17:06.890 --> 17:10.326
I was just...
surprised.

17:10.360 --> 17:12.726
(both laughing)

17:12.760 --> 17:14.489
You have everything you need?

17:14.530 --> 17:16.395
I'm good.

17:16.430 --> 17:18.591
You gonna have time
to enjoy the set?

17:18.630 --> 17:20.439
Yes, of course.

17:20.470 --> 17:22.438
*

17:22.470 --> 17:24.700
I'm happy to be here.

17:24.740 --> 17:27.106
It's a big night for you.
Look around.

17:27.140 --> 17:29.700
Oye, Teresa.

17:29.740 --> 17:31.344
You got time for me now?

17:31.380 --> 17:32.847
Another 30 minutes,
I'm gonna be too drunk

17:32.880 --> 17:34.040
to talk any business.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.571
*

17:36.620 --> 17:38.383
It's my agave distributor.

17:38.420 --> 17:40.615
*

17:40.660 --> 17:42.082
I'll be right back.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.223
TERESA: Have fun.

17:43.260 --> 17:46.252
*

17:46.290 --> 17:47.518
TERESA: Let's go to my office.

17:47.560 --> 17:52.964
*

17:54.570 --> 17:57.539
(suspenseful music)

17:57.570 --> 18:04.578
*

18:11.820 --> 18:13.082
That's a lot of food.

18:13.120 --> 18:16.089
Oh, you--
honey, you scared me.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.758
-TONY: Sorry.
-No, it's okay.

18:17.790 --> 18:20.122
Lord knows we all _have a reason
to be jumpy right now.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.799
Um, listen, I made you a whole
bunch of sandwiches, okay?

18:22.830 --> 18:24.468
I'm gonna put them
in the fridge.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.060
It should be enough to last you,
like, a couple of days.

18:27.100 --> 18:29.398
You're leaving.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.465
My mom used to do that
whenever she was getting ready

18:31.510 --> 18:32.659
to go away.

18:37.810 --> 18:40.074
Yeah, I have to go.

18:40.110 --> 18:41.509
Why?

18:43.690 --> 18:45.248
It's because of Teresa.

18:45.290 --> 18:46.609
Mm-mm, no.

18:46.650 --> 18:48.151
Okay, this is not her fault.

18:49.620 --> 18:51.827
I made a horrible mistake.

18:52.990 --> 18:55.788
And she trusted me,
and I betrayed her.

18:56.860 --> 18:59.624
Trust is just a really
hard thing to get back

18:59.670 --> 19:01.069
once it's been lost.

19:02.870 --> 19:04.701
But here's the good news.

19:04.740 --> 19:08.130
Okay, she loves you so much
and you will be safe here.

19:08.180 --> 19:10.307
You know, people have been
saying that all my life.

19:12.080 --> 19:13.342
Look where I ended up.

19:13.380 --> 19:16.349
(dramatic music)

19:16.380 --> 19:18.519
No. Hey, Tony?

19:18.550 --> 19:21.485
*

19:21.520 --> 19:23.556
BOAZ: I made the thief
pay back what he stole,

19:23.590 --> 19:24.784
just like you said.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.855
I appreciate it.

19:26.890 --> 19:29.893
But you didn't have to come
all this way just to deliver it.

19:29.930 --> 19:31.898
I know you have
your doubts about me.

19:31.930 --> 19:35.138
But I wanted to reassure you.

19:35.170 --> 19:37.730
You have my loyalty.

19:37.770 --> 19:40.603
BOAZ: I wanted you to look
into my eyes when I told you.

19:45.010 --> 19:46.898
You run Sinaloa,

19:46.950 --> 19:48.508
but you represent me there.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.582
I need you to know
I can rely on my people.

19:54.060 --> 19:55.755
I need to know
I can rely on you.

19:55.790 --> 19:58.350
You can.

19:58.390 --> 20:01.188
I'm glad you came
and we understand each other.

20:04.570 --> 20:05.889
I should get back.

20:09.770 --> 20:12.034
-(cell phone vibrating)
-Gracias.

20:12.070 --> 20:13.901
Miss Salerno?

20:13.940 --> 20:15.532
ABBY: We're calling off
the deal.

20:15.580 --> 20:17.343
Wha--wait, what happened?

20:17.380 --> 20:19.075
My husband was attacked tonight

20:19.110 --> 20:20.873
and one of our trucks
was torched.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.013
Please don't contact us again.

20:23.050 --> 20:25.109
Miss Salerno.

20:25.150 --> 20:26.242
Hello?

20:27.460 --> 20:29.610
Que paso?

20:29.660 --> 20:31.582
Boucher attacked Frank Salerno.

20:31.630 --> 20:33.086
He set one of his
trucks on fire.

20:33.130 --> 20:34.620
Puta madre.

20:34.660 --> 20:36.059
We got those people hurt.

20:36.100 --> 20:38.421
We need to make sure
they're okay.

20:38.470 --> 20:39.926
Teresita.

20:39.970 --> 20:41.665
Always the hard way.

20:44.470 --> 20:47.030
(car engine turning over)

20:47.070 --> 20:48.970
(car engine rewing)

20:49.010 --> 20:51.069
(tires squealing)

20:51.110 --> 20:53.613
(tense music)

20:53.650 --> 20:55.117
Do it, big man!

20:55.150 --> 21:02.158
*

21:17.070 --> 21:18.799
TERESA: This is Teresa.
I'm unavailable right now.

21:18.840 --> 21:20.307
Please leave a message.

21:20.340 --> 21:22.808
-(rock music playing)
-(sighs) Ah, man.

21:22.840 --> 21:25.638
What's with this pinche
hillbilly music?

21:25.680 --> 21:27.671
Let's get some mariachis
up in this bitch, no?

21:30.720 --> 21:32.278
Teresa needs to keep
a low profile,

21:32.320 --> 21:33.958
especially in this place.

21:35.190 --> 21:36.214
I am playing nice.

21:38.290 --> 21:40.622
What do they say?
When in Rome...

21:40.660 --> 21:42.753
*

21:42.800 --> 21:44.028
Remember me, amigo?

21:44.070 --> 21:45.469
Boss lady around?

21:45.500 --> 21:47.161
No.

21:47.200 --> 21:48.758
How's about setting
me and my boy up

21:48.800 --> 21:51.701
in your VIP section?

21:51.740 --> 21:53.207
*

21:53.240 --> 21:54.776
-Follow me.
-We're comped.

21:54.810 --> 21:55.834
You know that, right?

21:55.880 --> 21:57.643
*

21:57.680 --> 22:00.205
You comprendo?
On the house?

22:00.250 --> 22:01.877
*

22:04.190 --> 22:07.387
*

22:07.420 --> 22:10.389
(suspenseful music)

22:10.430 --> 22:16.426
*

22:23.710 --> 22:26.167
*

22:26.210 --> 22:28.030
(car door opens)

22:28.080 --> 22:35.077
*

22:40.920 --> 22:42.717
-Big cabron!
-Big guy, do it,

22:42.760 --> 22:44.728
and she goes first.

22:44.760 --> 22:51.723
*

22:51.770 --> 22:54.534
Just walk.

22:54.570 --> 22:55.491
Teresa!

22:55.540 --> 22:56.598
Settle down, big man.

22:56.640 --> 23:03.648
*

23:10.750 --> 23:11.887
Hey there, cher.

23:11.920 --> 23:13.751
*

23:13.790 --> 23:15.712
I bet you didn't think you
was gonna see me again so soon,

23:15.760 --> 23:16.909
now did you?

23:16.960 --> 23:19.622
You said you know people.
So do I.

23:19.660 --> 23:21.992
You should think about this
before you do anything.

23:31.670 --> 23:33.103
(chains clattering)

23:33.140 --> 23:35.028
Come on, cher.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.604
You come walk with me.

23:41.950 --> 23:44.919
(rock music)

23:44.950 --> 23:51.958
*

23:53.330 --> 23:57.255
BOUCHER: You know,
this farm, it, uh--

23:57.300 --> 23:59.666
it done been in my family
for generations, now.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.807
You know, my daddy,
he used to wrestle gators.

24:04.840 --> 24:07.570
And he done learned me
the four steps of it.

24:07.610 --> 24:09.578
-(water splashing)
-Now, first step,

24:09.610 --> 24:10.975
that's the most dangerous.

24:11.010 --> 24:12.568
BOUCHER: Getting on its back.

24:12.610 --> 24:16.011
You always approach a gator
from behind.

24:16.050 --> 24:18.814
BOUCHER: 'Cause you wanna
bind up those hind legs,

24:18.850 --> 24:20.442
keeping the feet off the ground

24:20.490 --> 24:22.788
so they can't whip that tail
around at you.

24:22.820 --> 24:26.153
Ooh, that happen,
hah.

24:26.190 --> 24:27.828
(alligator snarling)

24:27.860 --> 24:29.828
Right there
you done lost control.

24:29.860 --> 24:32.795
BOUCHER: And keeping control,
well...

24:32.830 --> 24:35.139
(alligator snarling)

24:35.170 --> 24:38.207
That's the key to your survival.

24:38.240 --> 24:41.209
(rock music playing)

24:41.240 --> 24:45.040
*

24:45.080 --> 24:47.548
(groaning)

24:47.580 --> 24:49.719
(water splashing)

24:49.750 --> 24:52.514
Now, then you get your fingers

24:52.550 --> 24:56.179
up underneath that gator's jaws

24:56.220 --> 25:02.056
and you start to feel all that
soft skin all around the bone.

25:02.100 --> 25:05.069
(rock music playing)

25:05.100 --> 25:07.637
*

25:07.670 --> 25:08.739
(water splashing)

25:08.770 --> 25:10.067
BOUCHER: And you get that head

25:10.100 --> 25:12.204
up at a 90-degree angle.

25:12.240 --> 25:13.798
(rock music playing)

25:13.840 --> 25:16.229
(both grunting)

25:16.280 --> 25:19.169
And they can't fight back.

25:19.210 --> 25:21.019
BOUCHER:
That's step number three.

25:21.050 --> 25:22.711
Gaining submission.

25:22.750 --> 25:24.547
Not unlike my business.

25:24.590 --> 25:26.239
*

25:26.290 --> 25:28.758
As of tonight,

25:28.790 --> 25:32.328
I am in control
of Salerno Transport.

25:32.360 --> 25:34.191
You said there was a step four.

25:34.230 --> 25:35.527
(laughing)

25:35.560 --> 25:38.427
How you gonna jump off
and get away

25:38.470 --> 25:40.836
without you don't get eaten up?

25:40.870 --> 25:42.497
(both grunting)

25:42.540 --> 25:47.739
*

25:47.780 --> 25:51.375
(car engine rewing)

25:51.410 --> 25:55.073
(gunfire)

25:55.120 --> 25:56.109
(engine rattling)

25:56.150 --> 25:58.038
(crashing)

25:58.090 --> 26:00.718
(suspenseful music)

26:00.760 --> 26:02.512
(gunfire)

26:02.560 --> 26:04.858
*

26:04.890 --> 26:05.857
POTE: Get in!

26:05.890 --> 26:08.097
*

26:08.130 --> 26:11.861
(car engine rewing)

26:11.900 --> 26:13.561
(gunshot)

26:13.600 --> 26:20.608
*

26:26.550 --> 26:28.074
Did your cousin
ever text you back?

26:28.120 --> 26:29.542
Kid's a basket case.

26:29.580 --> 26:31.480
(laughing)

26:31.520 --> 26:33.909
Hey, Jay-vier.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.916
(laughing)

26:35.960 --> 26:37.257
We're closing.

26:37.290 --> 26:39.724
This here is N'awllins.

26:39.760 --> 26:42.752
Ain't no such thing
as last call here.

26:42.800 --> 26:47.760
Hell, I'm the liquor board, son.
I tell you when you close.

26:47.800 --> 26:49.438
One more round.

26:52.170 --> 26:53.933
For the road.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.777
RENE: Sounds like a plan.

26:55.810 --> 26:57.607
Oy, primo.

27:00.180 --> 27:02.319
-While you're at it?
-Don't do anything stupid.

27:02.350 --> 27:03.749
(chuckles)

27:03.790 --> 27:05.087
(suspenseful music)

27:05.120 --> 27:06.781
No promises,
pendejo.

27:06.820 --> 27:13.828
*

27:15.660 --> 27:17.127
What's that?

27:17.160 --> 27:19.299
(Pote speaking Spanish)

27:19.330 --> 27:21.833
(sirens wailing)

27:21.870 --> 27:24.304
(Teresa breathing heavily)

27:24.340 --> 27:25.967
MAN: Cut the engine!

27:26.010 --> 27:27.807
It's the judge.

27:27.840 --> 27:29.933
POTE: Lafayette.

27:29.980 --> 27:33.302
*

27:33.350 --> 27:35.716
You and the boss lady
sit tight now.

27:35.750 --> 27:37.377
Keep your hands in sight.

27:37.420 --> 27:39.888
MAN: Do not step out
of this vehicle until I say so.

27:39.920 --> 27:42.218
Miss Mendoza.

27:42.260 --> 27:43.818
How good to see you again.

27:43.860 --> 27:48.354
*

27:48.400 --> 27:52.621
I--I do apologize
for the informality.

27:52.670 --> 27:55.559
The accommodations here
were the best we could manage

27:55.600 --> 27:58.637
at this ungodly hour.

27:58.670 --> 28:00.137
What do you want?

28:00.170 --> 28:02.809
I like to keep a finger
on the pulse of my city

28:02.840 --> 28:06.378
through my--my man here,
Detective Green.

28:06.410 --> 28:09.311
Uh, he brought something
to my attention tonight,

28:09.350 --> 28:13.184
and I--I felt compelled
to look into it.

28:13.220 --> 28:19.227
And quite frankly, Joel,
all roads led to you.

28:19.260 --> 28:22.752
Aw, now, Judge,
you know that I done got

28:22.800 --> 28:27.499
a business relationship
with Salerno Transport.

28:27.530 --> 28:30.567
As a member of both the legal
and business communities,

28:30.600 --> 28:34.502
I--I feel obliged to step in
and--and mediate

28:34.540 --> 28:36.735
before anyone else gets hurt.

28:36.780 --> 28:39.749
(suspenseful music)

28:39.780 --> 28:42.715
I made a fair offer
to the Salernos.

28:42.750 --> 28:44.718
They accepted.

28:44.750 --> 28:48.754
But Mr. Boucher threatened them,
then kidnapped me

28:48.790 --> 28:50.951
and my associate.

28:50.990 --> 28:52.685
(Boucher laughing)

28:52.730 --> 28:54.459
Now, Judge,

28:54.500 --> 28:59.699
this, uh, tifi
she telling tales.

28:59.730 --> 29:01.595
(clicking tongue)

29:01.640 --> 29:03.232
I've, uh--

29:03.270 --> 29:08.230
I've known Mr. Boucher
here for many years.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.532
CECIL: I know what he does.

29:10.580 --> 29:15.370
You--you--you have
some naggin' questions.

29:15.420 --> 29:21.450
Just what do you want
with all those trucks?

29:21.490 --> 29:26.120
I want to expand the market
for my tequila out of state.

29:26.160 --> 29:30.051
The Salernos, they have
a reliable fleet of trucks

29:30.100 --> 29:32.967
and shipping routes that
are perfect for what I need.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.662
That all you transporting?

29:35.700 --> 29:37.565
Liquor?

29:37.600 --> 29:39.500
TERESA: I don't understand.

29:39.540 --> 29:42.236
What it comes down to for me,

29:42.280 --> 29:44.339
my long-standing relationship

29:44.380 --> 29:46.405
with Mr. Boucher
notwithstanding,

29:46.450 --> 29:50.739
is the amount of money
generated by, let's say,

29:50.780 --> 29:52.441
narcotics trafficking.

29:52.490 --> 29:56.483
*

29:56.520 --> 30:00.684
CECIL: Versus that of
a white trash shylock

30:00.730 --> 30:03.028
gutting a trucking
company for parts.

30:03.060 --> 30:04.869
(gagging)

30:04.900 --> 30:07.528
(choking)

30:07.570 --> 30:09.492
*

30:09.540 --> 30:13.306
(gagging)

30:13.340 --> 30:20.348
*

30:26.550 --> 30:29.212
I never liked
that son of a bitch.

30:29.260 --> 30:31.455
*

30:31.490 --> 30:34.220
I especially didn't appreciate
the ungentlemanly way

30:34.260 --> 30:36.797
he spoke to you.

30:36.830 --> 30:39.799
CECIL: It offends me
as a Southerner.

30:39.830 --> 30:41.388
*

30:41.440 --> 30:45.536
So to the victor
go the sp0|ls.

30:45.570 --> 30:47.970
It would appear you're now
free to close your deal

30:48.010 --> 30:49.705
with Salerno Transport,

30:49.740 --> 30:51.674
and the Salernos don't have
to worry

30:51.710 --> 30:53.849
about Joel Boucher anymore.

30:53.880 --> 30:56.519
Mediation concluded.

30:56.550 --> 30:58.313
What do you want for this?

30:58.350 --> 31:00.147
*

31:00.190 --> 31:02.385
Transparency between us.

31:02.420 --> 31:04.320
*

31:04.360 --> 31:07.557
I want the money
you offered Boucher.

31:07.590 --> 31:10.650
CECIL: Consider it
an operating tax.

31:10.700 --> 31:14.067
This is my town.

31:14.100 --> 31:17.934
A sparrow doesn't fall from
a tree without my knowledge.

31:17.970 --> 31:22.737
*

31:28.950 --> 31:31.009
It must have been Dumas
who told the judge about us.

31:31.050 --> 31:33.018
Pinche judge is a snake.

31:33.050 --> 31:35.450
Maybe that snake
can become an ally.

31:35.490 --> 31:36.957
If we can trust him.

31:36.990 --> 31:39.049
We need to know
everything about him.

31:40.430 --> 31:42.022
Everyone has a weakness.

31:42.060 --> 31:43.652
We need to find his.

31:45.230 --> 31:48.165
Let's put Chicho to follow him
for a couple of days.

31:53.510 --> 31:55.637
I thought you weren't
coming back tonight.

31:55.680 --> 31:57.136
It's late.
You should be sleeping.

31:59.280 --> 32:01.612
I couldn't sleep.

32:01.650 --> 32:02.912
What's the matter?

32:05.990 --> 32:07.617
I know you don't
want Kelly Anne here.

32:09.290 --> 32:12.521
But if she leaves,
someone might go after her.

32:14.300 --> 32:15.858
You know, she saved my life.

32:19.030 --> 32:20.497
She's family.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.728
KELLY ANNE:
Hey. Sorry.

32:24.770 --> 32:27.364
Um, Teresa, could I maybe
talk to you for a minute?

32:31.710 --> 32:33.143
Go back to bed, okay?

32:33.180 --> 32:34.169
We'll talk tomorrow.

32:34.220 --> 32:35.448
Okay.

32:35.480 --> 32:36.412
Have a good night.

32:36.450 --> 32:37.371
Good night.

32:49.530 --> 32:50.997
What did you tell him?

32:51.030 --> 32:52.395
Told him the truth.

32:54.340 --> 32:55.830
That I betrayed you.

32:55.870 --> 32:58.634
Did you tell him
you almost got me killed?

33:01.410 --> 33:03.537
I didn't tell him
all the details.

33:06.310 --> 33:08.414
Look, I don't expect you
to ever forgive me.

33:09.920 --> 33:11.683
So whatever you want
to do with me,

33:11.720 --> 33:13.745
however you want to handle this,
that's your choice.

33:15.720 --> 33:17.358
I deserve whatever I got coming.

33:19.390 --> 33:22.496
But you should at least know
how sorry I am.

33:23.900 --> 33:26.118
KELLY ANNE: I don't know
ifI can ever make amends.

33:26.170 --> 33:28.365
I would really,
really like to try.

33:30.770 --> 33:33.534
I appreciate what you did
for Tony.

33:35.840 --> 33:38.570
But I can't trust you again.

33:42.050 --> 33:43.711
I understand.

33:43.750 --> 33:47.584
I don't want you anywhere
near me or my business.

33:55.260 --> 33:56.750
This is your house.

33:56.800 --> 33:59.769
It's not up to me
if she stays or goes.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.392
She's your guest.

34:14.750 --> 34:16.377
He's fine, Judge.

34:16.420 --> 34:19.218
Patrolman recognized him.
Called me.

34:19.250 --> 34:20.842
Good Lord,
what happened?

34:20.890 --> 34:23.279
Looks like he got disoriented.

34:23.320 --> 34:27.928
Just froze here a few blocks
from your place.

34:27.960 --> 34:30.724
RANDALL: I would have brought
him home, he wouldn't budge.

34:30.760 --> 34:33.729
(dramatic music)

34:33.770 --> 34:35.931
CECIL: Davis?

34:35.970 --> 34:37.767
*

34:37.800 --> 34:39.199
Son?

34:39.240 --> 34:42.209
*

34:42.240 --> 34:44.037
Can--can you hear me?

34:44.080 --> 34:46.378
*

34:46.410 --> 34:51.211
I--I--I got lost.

34:51.250 --> 34:53.741
Yeah.
Come with me, son.

34:53.790 --> 34:55.917
CECIL: I'm gonna take you home,
now.

34:55.960 --> 34:58.656
Just let go of the wheel.

34:58.690 --> 35:03.127
There you go. Yeah.

35:03.160 --> 35:04.627
Yeah.

35:04.670 --> 35:06.399
We're going home, son.

35:06.430 --> 35:07.920
Okay.

35:07.970 --> 35:10.063
*

35:10.100 --> 35:11.931
Come on, son.

35:11.970 --> 35:15.474
CECIL: Come on.

35:15.510 --> 35:17.808
Yeah.
That's all right.

35:17.840 --> 35:19.171
It's all right.

35:19.210 --> 35:25.615
*

35:25.650 --> 35:27.288
Go get some rest.

35:27.320 --> 35:29.982
I'll call ifI need you.

35:30.020 --> 35:31.055
Thank you.

35:33.730 --> 35:36.722
(car engine rewing)

35:39.730 --> 35:42.665
(phone beeping)

35:44.140 --> 35:45.334
(cell phone vibrating)

35:45.370 --> 35:46.769
Ah.

35:46.810 --> 35:48.277
Miss Mendoza.

35:48.310 --> 35:49.470
You're burning the midnight oil.

35:49.510 --> 35:51.205
The deal is off.

35:51.250 --> 35:53.002
Whoa, hold on.

35:53.050 --> 35:54.005
Whoa, slow down.

35:54.050 --> 35:56.610
You broke our trust.

35:56.650 --> 35:58.379
I don't know what
you're talking about.

36:00.020 --> 36:01.180
-(phone beeps)
-I don't--

36:10.660 --> 36:13.060
MAN: Good night.

36:18.370 --> 36:20.235
That one reminds me of Emilia.

36:22.340 --> 36:23.671
She was the one, 'mano.

36:24.610 --> 36:26.248
She was the one.

36:27.380 --> 36:31.146
You know, I've been with more
fine women than I can count,

36:31.180 --> 36:32.738
but I can't get past her.

36:38.760 --> 36:40.523
(clattering)

36:45.530 --> 36:47.691
I better go keep an eye
on this pendejo.

36:51.710 --> 36:54.679
(light music,
singing in Spanish)

36:54.710 --> 36:56.337
*

36:56.380 --> 36:58.007
We must have been pretty bad
to send you running

36:58.040 --> 36:58.938
out the front door.

36:58.980 --> 37:00.504
(laughing)

37:00.550 --> 37:02.040
*

37:02.080 --> 37:03.570
I'm so sorry.

37:03.620 --> 37:06.180
*

37:06.220 --> 37:08.882
I had a problem
with my godson again.

37:08.920 --> 37:10.751
Everything okay?

37:10.790 --> 37:11.950
It is now.

37:11.990 --> 37:14.891
*

37:14.930 --> 37:16.727
Can I come in?

37:16.760 --> 37:21.538
*

37:21.570 --> 37:22.537
Thank you.

37:22.570 --> 37:27.769
*

37:27.810 --> 37:30.108
TERESA: This is beautiful.

37:31.410 --> 37:33.708
EDDIE: Sorry it's a mess.

37:33.750 --> 37:35.149
I was working.

37:35.180 --> 37:37.114
*

37:37.150 --> 37:38.811
It's 3:00 in the morning.

37:38.850 --> 37:40.943
(chuckles)

37:40.990 --> 37:42.753
Helps me wind down after a gig.

37:42.790 --> 37:47.921
*

37:47.960 --> 37:50.895
I feel bad
I missed the show.

37:50.930 --> 37:52.625
I'm really sorry.

37:52.670 --> 37:54.638
Don't worry.

37:54.670 --> 37:56.991
There'll be other gigs.

37:57.040 --> 37:59.167
I'm real tight
with the club owner.

37:59.210 --> 38:02.429
*

38:02.480 --> 38:05.449
(piano music playing)

38:05.480 --> 38:06.799
*

38:06.850 --> 38:07.999
Leave it on.

38:08.050 --> 38:10.018
*

38:10.050 --> 38:11.119
It's nice.

38:11.150 --> 38:13.015
Um...

38:13.050 --> 38:14.244
*

38:14.290 --> 38:15.416
What is that?

38:15.460 --> 38:16.813
*

38:16.860 --> 38:22.526
Uh, just something we did
a few years back.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.323
Messing around in the studio.

38:24.370 --> 38:25.826
*

38:25.870 --> 38:28.589
It's great.
Who's that playing?

38:28.640 --> 38:29.789
A friend of mine.

38:29.840 --> 38:32.638
*

38:32.670 --> 38:35.275
You should put that on an album.
He's great.

38:35.310 --> 38:38.177
*

38:38.210 --> 38:39.700
He's no longer with us.

38:39.750 --> 38:43.777
*

38:43.820 --> 38:44.946
I'm sorry.

38:44.990 --> 38:48.653
*

38:48.690 --> 38:50.453
Yeah.

38:50.490 --> 38:57.498
*

39:07.110 --> 39:08.532
(door opening)

39:17.350 --> 39:19.716
Hey, Jay-vier.

39:20.390 --> 39:22.813
(Ren laughing)

39:22.860 --> 39:24.748
Coming to watch me piss?

39:24.790 --> 39:26.155
Hmm?

39:26.190 --> 39:28.988
Oops, my bad.

39:29.030 --> 39:30.554
(Ren laughs)

39:30.600 --> 39:31.999
Just checking you don't
hurt yourself

39:32.030 --> 39:34.066
on your way out of here.

39:34.100 --> 39:39.037
Now, you and your compadre need
a cab or an Uber or something?

39:39.070 --> 39:40.958
Tell me the truth, amigo.

39:42.440 --> 39:45.102
You putting it
to that boss lady of yours?

39:45.150 --> 39:48.108
(suspenseful music)

39:48.150 --> 39:50.846
*

39:50.880 --> 39:53.212
I'm not your amigo, cabron.

39:53.250 --> 39:56.754
And you really need
to leave now.

39:56.790 --> 39:58.883
I bet she gives it
to you, though.

39:58.930 --> 40:00.420
*

40:00.460 --> 40:02.291
Kinda had you figured
for a bitch.

40:02.330 --> 40:04.469
(grunts)

40:04.500 --> 40:05.865
(gagging)

40:05.900 --> 40:07.197
(grunts)

40:07.230 --> 40:08.766
-(both grunting)
-(blows landing)

40:08.800 --> 40:11.132
(Ren shouting)

40:11.170 --> 40:13.559
(both grunting)

40:13.610 --> 40:15.407
*

40:15.440 --> 40:19.740
My name is Javier.

40:19.780 --> 40:21.577
-(blow lands)
-(Javier grunts)

40:21.620 --> 40:26.546
*

40:26.590 --> 40:28.785
(Javier grunting)

40:28.820 --> 40:35.828
*

40:40.530 --> 40:43.761
(both grunting)

40:43.800 --> 40:45.904
(Javier shouting)

40:45.940 --> 40:48.477
(both grunting)

40:48.510 --> 40:51.331
(Julian shouting)

40:51.380 --> 40:57.512
*

40:57.550 --> 40:59.780
Hey!

40:59.820 --> 41:02.288
(blows landing)

41:02.320 --> 41:06.188
(splashing)

41:06.230 --> 41:08.596
(all shouting)

41:11.130 --> 41:14.099
(all grunting)

41:14.130 --> 41:18.260
(Javier shouting)

41:18.300 --> 41:20.666
(Boaz laughing)

41:20.710 --> 41:25.272
*

41:25.310 --> 41:27.175
This is really bad, primo.

41:27.210 --> 41:32.011
*

41:32.050 --> 41:34.484
(laughing)

41:34.520 --> 41:36.681
