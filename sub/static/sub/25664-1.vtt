01:18.453 --> 01:20.866
<i>Thank you for the music</i>

01:21.915 --> 01:24.532
<i>The songs I'm singing</i>

01:25.419 --> 01:31.256
<i>Thanks for all the joy
they're bringing</i>

01:31.592 --> 01:34.551
<i>Who can live without it</i>

01:34.636 --> 01:38.346
<i>I ask in all honesty</i>

01:38.432 --> 01:40.389
<i>What would life be?</i>

01:41.101 --> 01:45.812
<i>Without a song or a dance,
what are we?</i>

01:46.231 --> 01:48.689
<i>So I say</i>

01:51.236 --> 01:53.899
<i>Thank you for the music</i>

01:54.448 --> 01:59.113
<i>For giving it to me</i>

02:00.871 --> 02:04.455
It would be amazing if someone could get
these to the mainland for the last post.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.915
The pleasure and privilege
will be mine.

02:07.002 --> 02:08.209
<i>Se√±or,</i> you're the manager.

02:08.502 --> 02:11.621
I need you to stay here and
make sure this place is ready

02:11.715 --> 02:14.082
for the most incredible
opening party of all time.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.711
Whatever you dream,
Miss Sophie, we will make real.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.681
This was her dream.
I'm just trying to see it through.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.601
You've done
much more than that.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.016
Yeah, but is it enough?

02:29.900 --> 02:31.016
I wish I could ask her.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.102
I wish she was here.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.716
It's collection time.
Let's not be late.

02:39.451 --> 02:40.451
Wait.

02:44.331 --> 02:45.993
She never shows up anyway.

02:49.544 --> 02:52.537
Don't worry. My mom
was late for everything.

03:00.389 --> 03:03.507
So,
it is nearly time for the graduating year

03:03.600 --> 03:05.387
to go out into the world,

03:05.686 --> 03:08.019
supported by their friends
and families,

03:08.105 --> 03:13.476
so many of whom they are grateful to
have in attendance on this august day.

03:13.985 --> 03:17.820
But first, custom dictates that
I call on the undergraduate

03:17.906 --> 03:20.319
- selected by his or her peers...
- Sorry, sorry.

03:20.409 --> 03:22.776
...to deliver
the valedictory address.

03:22.994 --> 03:25.407
This year,
that undergraduate,

03:25.914 --> 03:27.530
punctual as ever,

03:27.916 --> 03:30.124
is Donna Sheridan.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.756
You're going to do
great things, Donna.

03:50.313 --> 03:53.852
Thank you, Vice Chancellor,
for everything.

03:54.609 --> 03:58.523
<i>This place has taught me
so much</i>

03:58.947 --> 04:04.409
<i>about friendship,
loyalty, love,</i>

04:05.287 --> 04:10.282
<i>but most importantly,
it's taught me that the best things in life,</i>

04:10.751 --> 04:15.837
<i>the very best things,
happen unexpectedly.</i>

04:17.757 --> 04:18.757
<i>Hit it!</i>

04:24.014 --> 04:26.222
<i>Everybody screamed</i>

04:27.434 --> 04:29.266
<i>When I kissed the teacher</i>

04:29.352 --> 04:30.468
Yeah!

04:30.604 --> 04:33.142
<i>And they must have thought
They dreamed</i>

04:33.482 --> 04:35.599
<i>When I kissed the teacher</i>

04:36.359 --> 04:38.976
<i>All my friends at school</i>

04:39.070 --> 04:41.778
<i>They had never seen
The teacher blush</i>

04:41.865 --> 04:45.358
<i>She looked like a fool</i>

04:45.994 --> 04:47.360
<i>Nearly petrified</i>

04:47.454 --> 04:51.198
<i>'Cause she was
taken by surprise</i>

04:52.209 --> 04:54.075
<i>When I kissed the teacher</i>

04:55.295 --> 04:58.129
<i>Couldn't quite
believe their eyes</i>

04:58.215 --> 05:00.002
<i>When I kissed the teacher</i>

05:00.926 --> 05:03.339
<i>My whole class went wild</i>

05:03.845 --> 05:06.633
<i>As I held my breath
The world stood still</i>

05:06.723 --> 05:10.512
<i>But then she just smiled</i>

05:10.602 --> 05:13.185
<i>I was in the seventh heaven</i>

05:13.271 --> 05:16.355
<i>When I kissed the teacher</i>

05:17.234 --> 05:19.442
<i>What a mad day</i>

05:21.613 --> 05:25.527
<i>Now I see everything
In a different light</i>

05:26.493 --> 05:28.485
<i>What a mad day</i>

05:30.163 --> 05:31.995
<i>I was up in the air</i>

05:32.082 --> 05:34.415
<i>And she taught me
a lesson all right</i>

05:35.627 --> 05:40.713
<i>I was in a trance
When I kissed the teacher</i>

05:41.716 --> 05:46.757
<i>Suddenly I took a chance
When I kissed the teacher</i>

05:47.597 --> 05:50.010
<i>Leaning overme</i>

05:50.267 --> 05:56.264
<i>She was trying to explain
The laws of geometry</i>

05:57.274 --> 06:02.645
<i>And I couldn't help it
I just had to kiss the teacher</i>

06:03.864 --> 06:05.446
<i>What a mad day</i>

06:08.076 --> 06:11.365
<i>Now I see everything
In a different light</i>

06:12.956 --> 06:15.198
<i>What a mad day</i>

06:16.668 --> 06:18.330
<i>I was up in the air</i>

06:18.420 --> 06:20.662
<i>And she taught me
a lesson all right</i>

06:22.215 --> 06:27.176
<i>What a crazy day
When I kissed the teacher</i>

06:28.221 --> 06:33.182
<i>All my sense had flown away
When I kissed the teacher</i>

06:33.935 --> 06:36.518
<i>My whole class went wild</i>

06:36.605 --> 06:39.689
<i>As I held my breath
The world stood still</i>

06:39.774 --> 06:43.063
<i>But then she just smiled</i>

06:43.695 --> 06:50.443
<i>I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher</i>

06:50.535 --> 06:52.447
<i>I wanna hug, hug, hug him</i>

06:52.537 --> 06:56.622
<i>When I kissed the teacher</i>

06:56.708 --> 06:58.540
<i>I wanna hug, hug him</i>

06:58.627 --> 07:02.746
<i>When I kissed the teacher</i>

07:02.839 --> 07:04.876
<i>I wanna hug, hug, hug him</i>

07:04.966 --> 07:08.926
<i>When I kissed the teacher</i>

07:09.012 --> 07:10.844
<i>I wanna hug, hug him</i>

07:11.139 --> 07:14.928
<i>When I kissed the teacher</i>

07:21.232 --> 07:26.569
She didn't come.
She didn't come. My mother.

07:27.739 --> 07:29.651
Can you believe
she didn't come?

07:29.741 --> 07:30.801
She never comes.

07:30.825 --> 07:34.364
Ah, and every time, it surprises me.
I have gotta get better at that.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.867
You give that woman hell
when you get home.

07:36.957 --> 07:40.246
I am not going home.
Not for a long time.

07:40.710 --> 07:43.248
Oh, the old "stay away
as punishment" ploy.

07:43.338 --> 07:47.127
I tried that. But my parents
just rented out my room.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.424
And sold your dog.

07:49.511 --> 07:51.671
No, it's not punishment.
It's the opposite.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.471
It's like a gift to myself.

07:54.599 --> 07:55.599
Where will you go?

07:56.059 --> 07:58.301
Anywhere. Everywhere.

07:58.770 --> 08:04.107
Life is short, the world is wide,
and I wanna make some memories.

08:04.776 --> 08:06.545
In other words,
you're leaving us.

08:08.863 --> 08:10.104
I never would.

08:11.241 --> 08:14.075
I was just putting out feelers
for our future.

08:15.912 --> 08:18.996
Come on. We'll always
have each other.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.912
Dynamos, dynamite.

08:22.168 --> 08:25.286
Sleep all day
and whoop all night.

08:38.727 --> 08:39.842
Whoa!

09:10.633 --> 09:11.874
Oh, they're so beautiful.

09:12.886 --> 09:16.254
Uh, little to the left.
Little bit more. And down just a bit.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.555
Perfect. Good.

09:19.184 --> 09:21.517
Those flowers are beautiful.
Thank you so much.

09:24.481 --> 09:27.645
- Sky? What time is it there?
- It's early.

09:29.152 --> 09:30.392
I was just thinking
about you...

09:32.113 --> 09:34.856
About tomorrow.
How's it going?

09:34.949 --> 09:38.659
Oh, you know. Nothing focuses the
mind like the last minute.

09:38.745 --> 09:39.861
<i>You're ready.</i>

09:41.122 --> 09:43.910
<i>I can't believe I'm not
gonna be there. Feels weird.</i>

09:44.000 --> 09:46.367
Yeah, but we agreed.
Six weeks in New York,

09:46.461 --> 09:48.703
learning the hotel business
from the very best.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.042
It was too big a chance
to pass up.

09:51.382 --> 09:53.248
- Soph.
<i>- What?</i>

09:55.428 --> 09:56.509
- Nothing.
<i>- What?</i>

09:56.596 --> 09:57.632
No, it doesn't matter.

09:58.348 --> 09:59.884
Except that it obviously does.

10:02.644 --> 10:04.306
They've offered me
a job permanently.

10:07.816 --> 10:08.816
<i>Okay.</i>

10:09.776 --> 10:10.937
I can say no.

10:11.027 --> 10:13.235
But you don't want to.
You wanna say the opposite of no.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.357
<i>Yeah, I do.</i>

10:15.115 --> 10:16.195
But you could come with me.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.903
But I'm here.
I'm always gonna be here.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.780
Soph, your mum died
a year ago.

10:20.870 --> 10:23.487
And I rebuilt this hotel
in her honor.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.434
She wouldn't want you
to dedicate your life to her.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.166
- She dedicated hers to me.
- We can't keep having this fight.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.334
Apparently, we can,

10:29.420 --> 10:31.620
until we realize that there's
nothing left to fight for.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.590
- Sky?
- Yeah, I know.

10:42.725 --> 10:43.725
<i>I should go.</i>

10:45.145 --> 10:46.145
Yeah.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.224
I'll be thinking of you
tomorrow.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.189
<i>It's gonna be amazing.</i>

10:54.279 --> 10:55.279
Take care, Soph.

10:57.824 --> 10:58.985
Yeah, you, too, Sky.

11:09.252 --> 11:14.998
<i>They passed me by
All of those great romances</i>

11:15.091 --> 11:21.634
<i>It's as if you're robbing me
Of my rightful chances</i>

11:22.390 --> 11:28.557
<i>My picture clear
Everything seemed so easy</i>

11:29.731 --> 11:32.644
<i>And so I dealt you the blow</i>

11:33.359 --> 11:35.646
<i>One of us had to go</i>

11:36.529 --> 11:40.489
<i>Now it's different
I want you to know</i>

11:40.992 --> 11:43.826
<i>One of us is crying</i>

11:43.912 --> 11:49.032
<i>One of us is lying
in her lonely bed</i>

11:52.587 --> 11:55.421
<i>Staring at the ceiling</i>

11:56.925 --> 12:02.216
<i>Wishing she was
somewhere else instead</i>

12:04.349 --> 12:07.217
<i>One of us is lonely</i>

12:07.310 --> 12:12.476
<i>One of us is only
waiting for a call</i>

12:16.027 --> 12:21.318
<i>Sorry for himself
Feeling stupid, feeling small</i>

12:21.866 --> 12:25.735
<i>Wishing he had
never left at all</i>

12:28.164 --> 12:33.876
<i>I saw myself
as a concealed attraction</i>

12:33.962 --> 12:40.459
<i>I felt you kept me away
From the heat and the action</i>

12:41.302 --> 12:48.050
<i>Just like a child
Stubborn and misconceiving</i>

12:48.601 --> 12:51.514
<i>That's how I started the show</i>

12:52.230 --> 12:54.313
<i>One of us had to go</i>

12:55.441 --> 12:59.151
<i>Now I've changed
and I want you to know</i>

12:59.862 --> 13:02.479
<i>One of us is crying</i>

13:02.782 --> 13:05.695
<i>One of us is lying</i>

13:05.785 --> 13:07.993
<i>In his lonely bed</i>

13:11.541 --> 13:14.705
<i>Staring at the ceiling</i>

13:15.962 --> 13:20.377
<i>Wishing he was
somewhere else instead</i>

13:23.219 --> 13:25.802
<i>One of us is lonely</i>

13:26.180 --> 13:28.843
<i>One of us is only</i>

13:29.142 --> 13:31.555
<i>Waiting for a call</i>

13:34.939 --> 13:37.022
<i>Sorry for herself</i>

13:37.108 --> 13:40.226
<i>Feeling stupid, feeling small</i>

13:40.778 --> 13:45.148
<i>Wishing he had
never left at all</i>

13:45.241 --> 13:50.987
<i>Never left at all</i>

13:55.668 --> 14:00.333
The poor girl's under so much
pressure. The hotel reopening...

14:00.423 --> 14:02.005
We have to be strong for her.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.753
Strong. Absolutely.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.960
- She needs our support.
- Mmm.

14:06.054 --> 14:07.295
She needs bolstering.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.971
Yeah. Well, bolstering
is what she'll get.

14:10.058 --> 14:14.052
What she doesn't need, is you crying
every time someone mentions Donna.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.566
Oh, God.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.233
I'm so glad you're here.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.903
Come on, let's get
this show on the road.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.113
She's very strong.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.488
I can't wait to see
this hotel you've built.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.999
Well, it wasn't
actually me who built it.

14:37.085 --> 14:39.293
What's it called?

14:39.379 --> 14:40.790
The Hotel Bella Donna.

14:41.506 --> 14:43.213
Oh, God.

14:46.636 --> 14:49.674
So, two of your three
possible fathers can't make it?

14:49.764 --> 14:52.427
They're all my fathers,
and they have great reasons.

14:52.517 --> 14:55.760
Harry is doing some
huge deal in Tokyo,

14:55.853 --> 15:01.565
and Bill is receiving an award for being
the greatest Swede of all time.

15:02.485 --> 15:05.353
- Maybe it's for the best?
- Oh!

15:05.446 --> 15:10.237
No, it would be fine.
Absolutely fine. I'm very strong.

15:10.660 --> 15:13.073
Just tell me you didn't
invite your grandmother.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.528
Wicked Witch of the West.

15:14.622 --> 15:17.660
She hasn't been seen outside
of Las Vegas for decades.

15:21.212 --> 15:22.919
You must meet
our hotel manager.

15:32.849 --> 15:33.930
<i>Buenos d√≠as.</i>

15:34.976 --> 15:37.969
Be still my beating vagina.

15:39.730 --> 15:42.473
<i>Se√±or</i> Cienfuegos,
these are my mother's greatest friends.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.226
- This is Tanya.
<i>- Do√±a</i> Tanya.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.187
Hmm.

15:48.281 --> 15:51.365
Your beauty comes not only from the
exquisite structure of your bones

15:51.451 --> 15:53.408
and the laughter
in your sparkling eyes,

15:53.494 --> 15:57.659
but from the goodness that flowers
within you like a fountain.

15:58.332 --> 16:00.540
Have him washed
and brought to my tent.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.242
I don't think fountains
flower, do they?

16:02.336 --> 16:03.497
Mine does.

16:03.588 --> 16:04.874
And this is Rosie.

16:05.381 --> 16:06.417
Madam Rosie.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.624
Oh!

16:09.385 --> 16:13.095
You have the courage of a lion,
and the passion of a panther,

16:13.514 --> 16:16.473
and the wisdom of a flamingo.

16:16.559 --> 16:17.720
Are flamingos wise?

16:18.102 --> 16:19.468
Let the man speak.

16:21.272 --> 16:22.272
We are going to the jetty

16:22.356 --> 16:24.476
- to make the welcome decorations.
- Sounds wonderful.

16:24.567 --> 16:27.025
We do our best.
It is all we have.

16:28.112 --> 16:32.026
<i>Se√±or</i> Cienfuegos.

16:32.867 --> 16:34.574
It means "a hundred fires."

16:34.660 --> 16:36.401
So, that's 50 for you,
and 50 for me.

16:36.913 --> 16:38.404
- Ninety-ten.
- Sixty-forty.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.285
Eighty-twenty.
That's my final offer.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.196
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

17:18.079 --> 17:20.195
<i>Oh, bonjour, mademoiselle.</i>

17:22.290 --> 17:24.782
<i>Je suis</i> locked out
<i>de ma chambre.</i>

17:25.502 --> 17:26.618
Oh, I...

17:26.712 --> 17:31.798
<i>Je</i> put my tray out,
<i>dans le corridor.</i>

17:32.260 --> 17:35.003
<i>Mais, malheureusement,</i>

17:35.096 --> 17:40.808
<i>quand je</i> turned back,
<i>la porte √©tait ferm√©e.</i>

17:42.728 --> 17:48.269
<i>Et maintentant</i>...
<i>Je need un</i> spare key

17:49.569 --> 17:53.609
<i>pour reentrer
dans la chambre.</i>

17:55.116 --> 17:56.652
<i>S'il vous pla√Æt,
mademoiselle.</i>

17:57.868 --> 18:00.485
Sorry, I didn't understand.
Could you say all that again?

18:00.580 --> 18:02.572
<i>Oui. Je suis...</i>

18:04.292 --> 18:05.373
Wait a second.

18:06.127 --> 18:07.127
I don't work here.

18:08.671 --> 18:10.583
Well, I should
call the police.

18:10.881 --> 18:12.372
I'd rather you didn't.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.963
They probably wouldn't
understand my French anyway.

18:19.682 --> 18:21.674
So, Harry, you work in a bank?

18:22.310 --> 18:25.803
I'm afraid so. My father,
more or less, owns it.

18:26.981 --> 18:28.267
I'm fulfilling my destiny.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.650
I'm searching for mine.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.862
I have this feeling
it's in Greece.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.365
Why Greece?

18:38.576 --> 18:41.319
I'll find out when I get there.
Leaving tomorrow.

18:41.412 --> 18:42.528
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.705
All right,
better move fast. Um...

18:46.500 --> 18:48.660
Would you mind carrying your
bag on your other shoulder?

18:51.088 --> 18:52.670
Sure. Why?

18:52.757 --> 18:54.397
Because then, you see,
the hand nearest me

18:54.425 --> 19:00.137
would fall straight down and mine could,
sort of, brush against it,

19:00.222 --> 19:06.184
and then I could take your hand in mine
in a totally natural and spontaneous way.

19:08.022 --> 19:09.854
Or you could just ask
to hold my hand.

19:12.902 --> 19:14.518
Well, of course,
that's Plan B.

19:19.033 --> 19:21.901
It's not just Greece, generally.
It's a specific place.

19:22.745 --> 19:25.863
At the far end,
there's an island, Kalokairi.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.873
And people used to think
if you sailed on from there,

19:28.959 --> 19:31.542
you'd fall off
the edge of the world.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.496
That sounds like
the place for me.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.669
Of course it does.
Absolutely.

19:38.177 --> 19:42.512
Um, but now, perhaps we can
change the subject slightly

19:42.598 --> 19:46.433
and talk about the
advantages and disadvantages

19:46.519 --> 19:49.057
of us spending
the night together.

19:49.313 --> 19:52.147
Oh, okay. Bold move.

19:52.233 --> 19:53.769
Well, because from
where I'm sitting,

19:53.859 --> 19:57.102
I mean, it seems to be
pretty much all upside

19:57.196 --> 20:00.530
with very little reason
not to just crack straight on.

20:01.701 --> 20:02.701
Hmm.

20:04.078 --> 20:07.992
My family don't really react
well to foreign romances.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.786
Years ago, my mom
was in Central America,

20:10.876 --> 20:13.994
and she had her heart broken
into a million little pieces.

20:15.506 --> 20:16.506
Right.

20:17.675 --> 20:20.008
Yeah, fair enough, I mean,
I'm sure you're correct.

20:20.094 --> 20:21.130
Mmm.

20:24.849 --> 20:27.262
I mean, there is
one more reason, though.

20:28.102 --> 20:30.219
That you'd be doing me
a huge favor because...

20:32.148 --> 20:33.764
This would be my first time.

20:39.530 --> 20:40.691
You're kidding?

20:40.781 --> 20:43.444
No, it's a thing I always say
to make me look cool.

20:44.326 --> 20:46.192
I'm not kidding.

20:48.706 --> 20:49.706
Harry...

20:51.083 --> 20:53.370
We just met today.

20:53.461 --> 20:55.623
Yes, but when you know,
you know.

20:57.506 --> 20:58.747
When you fall, you fall.

21:00.217 --> 21:02.925
And when you're defeated by
love, you're utterly defeated.

21:03.012 --> 21:04.012
Whoo!

21:05.306 --> 21:11.394
<i>My, my, at Waterloo
Napoleon did surrender</i>

21:11.854 --> 21:13.561
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

21:13.647 --> 21:19.018
<i>And I have met my destiny
In quite a similar way</i>

21:20.196 --> 21:22.609
<i>The history book on the shelf</i>

21:23.449 --> 21:27.033
<i>Is always repeating itself</i>

21:28.662 --> 21:33.248
<i>Waterloo, I was defeated
You won the war</i>

21:33.334 --> 21:34.825
Oh, my...

21:35.044 --> 21:39.379
<i>Waterloo, promise
to love you forevermore</i>

21:40.674 --> 21:41.674
Whoo!

21:41.759 --> 21:45.924
<i>Waterloo, couldn't escape
If I wanted to</i>

21:47.014 --> 21:48.050
Ooh!

21:48.140 --> 21:52.430
<i>Waterloo, knowing my fate
Is to be with you</i>

21:53.020 --> 21:54.636
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa</i>

21:54.730 --> 21:59.020
<i>Waterloo, finally facing
my Waterloo</i>

22:06.951 --> 22:07.951
Oh!

22:09.119 --> 22:11.452
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

22:13.999 --> 22:17.993
<i>My, my, I tried
to hold you back</i>

22:18.087 --> 22:19.874
<i>But you were stronger</i>

22:20.297 --> 22:22.129
<i>- Oh, yeah
- Oh, yeah!</i>

22:22.216 --> 22:25.675
<i>And now it seems
my only chance</i>

22:25.761 --> 22:27.844
<i>Is giving up the fight</i>

22:28.722 --> 22:31.260
<i>And how could I ever refuse?</i>

22:31.934 --> 22:37.225
<i>I feel like I win when I lose</i>

22:37.314 --> 22:41.308
<i>Waterloo, couldn't escape
if I wanted to</i>

22:43.654 --> 22:47.989
<i>Waterloo, knowing my fate
Is to be with you</i>

22:48.534 --> 22:50.321
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa</i>

22:50.411 --> 22:54.496
<i>Waterloo, finally facing
my Waterloo</i>

23:09.847 --> 23:12.180
<i>So how could I ever refuse?</i>

23:12.850 --> 23:16.389
<i>I feel like I win when I lose</i>

23:16.478 --> 23:20.438
<i>Waterloo, couldn't escape
If I wanted to</i>

23:23.068 --> 23:27.278
<i>Waterloo, knowing my fate
Is to be with you</i>

23:27.781 --> 23:29.443
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa</i>

23:29.533 --> 23:33.447
<i>Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo</i>

23:34.788 --> 23:36.074
<i>Ooo-ooo-ooo</i>

23:36.165 --> 23:40.330
<i>Waterloo, knowing my fate
Is to be with you</i>

23:52.097 --> 23:53.633
That was the greatest event
of my life.

23:54.975 --> 23:56.466
But it's been
a good life, you know,

23:56.560 --> 23:57.560
full of happy things,

23:58.604 --> 23:59.765
but that was
the best of them.

24:02.232 --> 24:04.064
Did you enjoy...
No, don't answer that.

24:08.948 --> 24:09.948
But did you?

24:10.324 --> 24:11.656
It was lovely.

24:15.204 --> 24:16.204
Thank you.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.655
Oh, no. Thank you.

24:45.651 --> 24:46.812
Hello.

24:46.902 --> 24:49.189
Hello, darling. How's it
going down there?

24:50.948 --> 24:54.908
There's enough moussaka for
millions with moussaka to spare.

24:56.078 --> 24:57.159
I hope you'll be proud.

24:57.788 --> 24:58.869
I already am.

24:59.873 --> 25:01.159
And so are Bill and Harry.

25:01.625 --> 25:02.706
I miss them.

25:02.793 --> 25:04.625
They're really sorry
they couldn't make it.

25:04.712 --> 25:06.999
- If it had been any other date...
- I know.

25:08.882 --> 25:09.882
But I have you.

25:12.136 --> 25:15.925
To tell you the truth,
I'm not sure I can face it.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.849
I don't know if I can either,
but we still will.

25:21.395 --> 25:25.105
Because it's a special night,
not for mourning but for celebration.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.477
That's how Mom would have wanted it.

25:27.568 --> 25:28.854
She would've wanted
to be there.

25:30.070 --> 25:33.404
To get very drunk indeed,
and dance until she dropped.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.359
Our dancing queen.

25:40.789 --> 25:41.789
Yeah.

25:43.333 --> 25:44.540
It will get better.

25:45.294 --> 25:46.294
Yeah.

25:47.671 --> 25:49.082
Just not quite yet.

25:52.843 --> 25:54.880
- I'll see you later.
- See you later, kiddo.

26:01.685 --> 26:04.177
<i>So when
you're near me, darling</i>

26:04.271 --> 26:06.263
<i>Can't you hear me?</i>

26:11.820 --> 26:16.815
<i>The love you gave me
Nothing else can save me</i>

26:20.204 --> 26:22.161
<i>When you're gone</i>

26:23.749 --> 26:30.588
<i>How can I even try to go on?</i>

26:33.592 --> 26:35.800
<i>When you're gone</i>

26:38.597 --> 26:40.964
<i>Though I try</i>

26:43.727 --> 26:49.644
<i>How can I carry on?</i>

27:00.828 --> 27:01.864
Hey.

27:12.798 --> 27:15.381
You grew your hair.
It's longer now.

27:16.343 --> 27:18.380
It is a bit. Yeah.

27:18.929 --> 27:23.594
I know we could talk about that,
but the ferry leaves any second,

27:23.684 --> 27:26.768
and I think great things
are waiting for me.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.228
I prefer it shorter.

27:36.864 --> 27:39.026
Wait! Wait!

27:40.325 --> 27:42.908
Please! Don't. Oh, God.

27:42.995 --> 27:46.113
Turn around right now!
It's not too late!

27:48.041 --> 27:49.248
This is great.

27:50.085 --> 27:52.202
I'm just gonna
follow you everywhere.

27:52.296 --> 27:54.504
By the end of the day,
I'll have a whole new wardrobe.

27:55.257 --> 27:56.457
I don't think
that'll suit you.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.257
I say I can make it work.

27:59.094 --> 28:01.006
I really wanted
to catch that ferry.

28:02.556 --> 28:04.092
There'll be another tomorrow.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.390
Thanks.

28:09.271 --> 28:15.108
Right, uh, but what would be really great,
today, not tomorrow,

28:15.527 --> 28:19.271
is if somewhere in this harbor
there was a guy.

28:19.865 --> 28:23.108
Young, tall,
dashingly handsome.

28:23.202 --> 28:25.159
He's probably
passable-looking,

28:26.538 --> 28:27.538
but he has a boat.

28:27.998 --> 28:30.615
And a couple of days free before
he takes part in a sailing race.

28:31.293 --> 28:33.455
So, maybe he could take her
where she wants to go.

28:33.545 --> 28:36.037
He'd love to.
But the sad fact is,

28:37.007 --> 28:39.545
this isn't my boat.
I just wanted to impress you.

28:43.472 --> 28:44.588
Oh, okay.

28:45.140 --> 28:50.056
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
Jump on. I'm Bill.

28:58.403 --> 29:00.520
I actually have an elderly
relative on the island

29:00.614 --> 29:02.230
who helped me buy this boat.

29:02.824 --> 29:04.156
There are two beds,

29:05.118 --> 29:08.907
but, unfortunately,
one of them's rather full.

29:11.291 --> 29:12.407
Convenient.

29:14.211 --> 29:17.704
You have one of those smiles that
makes the rest of the world smile too.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.673
It's lucky this trip
is not long enough

29:20.759 --> 29:23.718
for my fragile heart to shatter
completely when you leave my boat.

29:24.096 --> 29:27.430
I get it.
You're one of them.

29:29.268 --> 29:30.509
One of who?

29:30.936 --> 29:34.771
There are
two kinds of seducer.

29:36.149 --> 29:42.362
The first doesn't actually like women,
so wants to assert his power over them.

29:42.990 --> 29:46.074
But the second,
and far more dangerous,

29:46.743 --> 29:50.157
is the guy who genuinely
falls in love every evening

29:50.247 --> 29:52.864
only to fall out of it again
the next morning.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.409
But as you run away,
you tell her you're the one in pain

29:56.503 --> 29:59.211
and she's just too much
for you to handle.

29:59.923 --> 30:01.004
Like this?

30:04.928 --> 30:08.467
<i>When you were
lonely You needed a man</i>

30:09.057 --> 30:13.051
<i>Someone to lean on
Well, I understand</i>

30:13.395 --> 30:15.227
<i>It's only natural</i>

30:15.314 --> 30:17.931
<i>But why did it have to be me?</i>

30:18.984 --> 30:20.816
Just like that, yes.

30:21.361 --> 30:25.105
<i>Nights can be empty
And nights can be cold</i>

30:25.657 --> 30:29.651
<i>So you were looking
For someone to hold</i>

30:29.745 --> 30:31.532
<i>That's only natural</i>

30:31.621 --> 30:34.785
<i>But why did it have to be me?</i>

30:38.086 --> 30:41.921
<i>I was so lonesome
I was blue</i>

30:42.007 --> 30:46.718
<i>I couldn't help it
It had to be you and I</i>

30:47.637 --> 30:51.347
<i>Always thought you knew
the reason why</i>

30:51.433 --> 30:52.890
Huh?

30:54.853 --> 30:58.142
<i>I only wanted
A little love affair</i>

30:58.940 --> 31:02.433
<i>Now I can see you are
beginning to care</i>

31:02.527 --> 31:05.736
<i>But, baby, believe me</i>

31:06.698 --> 31:10.692
<i>It's better to forget me</i>

31:14.998 --> 31:17.115
Your hair, it's shorter now.

31:17.667 --> 31:20.747
Well, yes, I had to cut it for work.
I wonder, could you please hurry up a bit?

31:21.254 --> 31:23.246
You see, I followed a girl
all the way from Paris.

31:24.216 --> 31:28.301
She wrote me a note.
A very kind note, saying goodbye.

31:29.471 --> 31:32.054
But when you find the only girl
you think you're ever gonna love

31:32.140 --> 31:35.633
it's gotta be worth one more try.
Don't you think?

31:36.895 --> 31:38.056
It's better short.

31:39.731 --> 31:43.395
<i>Men are the toys
In the game that you play</i>

31:43.777 --> 31:47.270
<i>When you get tired
You throw them away</i>

31:47.864 --> 31:50.026
<i>That's only natural</i>

31:50.117 --> 31:52.450
<i>But why did it have to be me?</i>

32:00.168 --> 32:03.912
<i>Falling in love
With a woman like you</i>

32:04.381 --> 32:07.670
<i>Happens so quickly
There's nothing to do</i>

32:08.301 --> 32:10.088
<i>It's only natural</i>

32:10.178 --> 32:13.012
<i>But why did it have to be me?</i>

32:13.473 --> 32:14.805
We only just met.

32:14.891 --> 32:16.302
And you're not
that kind of girl?

32:16.393 --> 32:18.931
Absolutely not. Usually.

32:19.020 --> 32:20.181
Hey!

32:20.981 --> 32:24.474
- What was that?
- Nothing, a seagull. Now, where were we?

32:25.569 --> 32:27.185
<i>It's only natural</i>

32:28.238 --> 32:30.321
<i>But why did it have to be...</i>

32:30.407 --> 32:31.523
Hey!

32:32.242 --> 32:33.403
Come on!

32:37.789 --> 32:38.996
We're coming.

32:43.753 --> 32:44.753
Hi.

32:45.130 --> 32:46.666
Just checking
you're not in danger,

32:46.756 --> 32:48.497
which you're obviously not,
so we'll be off.

32:48.592 --> 32:49.924
But my engine is not working.

32:50.010 --> 32:53.094
Oh! Oh, that is bad luck.

32:53.180 --> 32:55.046
I'll radio for someone
to come and help you.

32:55.140 --> 32:56.256
They should be along soon.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.015
- Bill.
- Please. Please!

32:58.226 --> 33:00.639
There is a woman waiting for me
on the mainland.

33:01.188 --> 33:04.807
Her family, they not want her to marry
a simple fisherman like Alexio.

33:05.734 --> 33:10.195
They want rich man. Ugly, fat,
big mole on face, but rich.

33:11.364 --> 33:12.364
But she...

33:13.909 --> 33:14.909
She want me.

33:16.161 --> 33:18.995
And I love her
with all my heartness.

33:20.707 --> 33:24.872
Please help, kind sir and beautiful
lady with head full of curls.

33:26.463 --> 33:27.783
Well, obviously,
we're doing this.

33:28.465 --> 33:29.465
- Yes!
- Yes!

33:38.266 --> 33:39.302
There!

33:40.644 --> 33:43.057
I see them.
Okay, everyone, we're nearly...

33:43.146 --> 33:44.432
Apollonia!

33:46.483 --> 33:47.483
Whoa!

33:48.485 --> 33:50.727
What are you doing?
We could get you closer.

33:50.820 --> 33:54.564
If you love someone,
you're willing to die for her!

33:55.283 --> 33:57.991
Yeah, but you don't have to.
It's an important distinction.

33:58.078 --> 33:59.285
Apollonia!

34:00.664 --> 34:01.905
Alexio!

34:01.998 --> 34:03.489
Apollo...

34:03.583 --> 34:05.870
He's just swallowed
a big mouthful of water,

34:05.961 --> 34:08.418
but the basic point he's trying to make
is that he loves you.

34:08.505 --> 34:11.714
- What?
- He loves you!

34:12.842 --> 34:13.922
Apollonia!

34:16.513 --> 34:18.254
Apollonia! Apollonia!

34:19.014 --> 34:21.757
Apollonia! Apollonia!
Come back!

34:34.072 --> 34:35.072
Apollonia!

34:37.993 --> 34:39.029
Apollonia!

34:39.327 --> 34:41.409
- Good work.
- You, too.

34:42.706 --> 34:43.706
I love you!

34:45.917 --> 34:47.658
Oh, God. I don't think
she can swim either.

34:56.844 --> 34:58.552
- Apollonia!
- Whoo!

34:59.848 --> 35:01.158
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

35:01.182 --> 35:04.262
- Oh, good morning. It's so nice. Guys.
- I'm glad you like it.

35:04.311 --> 35:07.145
I do. And these are perfect.
Everything is.

35:07.230 --> 35:08.230
Thank you.

35:08.315 --> 35:11.433
It's so good.
It's all so amazing.

35:11.526 --> 35:12.812
If you are happy...

35:12.902 --> 35:15.019
I would be even happier
if you were happy.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.821
No happiness for me.
As you say, that ship sailed

35:18.742 --> 35:19.949
many long years ago.

35:20.493 --> 35:23.986
But ships turn around.
They come back.

35:24.080 --> 35:25.196
Not for me.

35:25.624 --> 35:28.583
She left, never to return.

35:28.960 --> 35:33.045
But don't you worry.
I have made my peace with pain.

35:33.548 --> 35:35.164
You and me both, <i>Se√±or.</i>

35:39.012 --> 35:40.093
What? What is it?

35:41.389 --> 35:42.389
I'm not sure.

35:43.725 --> 35:46.012
- Tell me.
- I fear a storm is coming.

35:50.690 --> 35:52.170
You sure
you're okay here?

35:53.610 --> 35:54.610
Yeah, I'll be fine.

35:55.195 --> 35:57.061
I'll come right back
after the race.

35:58.698 --> 36:00.189
But that won't be
for three weeks.

36:00.283 --> 36:01.523
Look at this place.

36:02.369 --> 36:03.369
Isn't it beautiful?

36:04.162 --> 36:05.162
It is, yeah.

36:06.873 --> 36:08.364
What? What's wrong?

36:09.292 --> 36:10.499
Storm is coming.

36:10.919 --> 36:12.455
It's a clear sky.

36:12.671 --> 36:15.459
Trust me.
Actually, don't.

36:16.341 --> 36:17.502
But I know I'm right.

36:17.884 --> 36:19.000
I'll still be fine.

36:21.096 --> 36:22.507
I got a very good feeling.

36:34.234 --> 36:36.476
And you and Sam
did all of this?

36:36.569 --> 36:37.569
We had some help.

36:37.696 --> 36:38.696
From Sky.

36:39.280 --> 36:42.569
Right. Yes, right.
And there is more.

36:44.953 --> 36:45.953
Hello?

36:49.249 --> 36:50.249
Hello!

36:54.838 --> 36:56.249
<i>How did she know?</i>

36:57.090 --> 36:58.090
How did Donna know?

36:58.591 --> 36:59.591
What?

37:00.427 --> 37:02.089
That that could be this?

37:02.595 --> 37:06.054
I guess she just saw
the future.

37:11.604 --> 37:15.644
<i>I have a dream</i>

37:16.317 --> 37:19.355
<i>A song to sing</i>

37:21.072 --> 37:24.816
<i>To help me cope</i>

37:25.827 --> 37:28.820
<i>With anything</i>

37:31.166 --> 37:34.580
<i>If you see the wonder</i>

37:36.004 --> 37:38.212
<i>Of a fairy-tale</i>

37:40.633 --> 37:44.126
<i>You can take the future</i>

37:45.513 --> 37:48.756
<i>Even if you fail</i>

37:50.059 --> 37:53.473
<i>I believe in angels</i>

37:54.689 --> 37:59.684
<i>Something good
In everything I see</i>

37:59.778 --> 38:03.237
<i>I believe in angels</i>

38:04.365 --> 38:08.609
<i>When I know the time
is right for me</i>

38:09.078 --> 38:12.321
<i>Across the stream</i>

38:13.625 --> 38:17.164
<i>I have a dream</i>

38:18.129 --> 38:22.544
<i>I have a dream</i>

38:22.634 --> 38:27.299
<i>A fantasy</i>

38:27.388 --> 38:30.051
<i>To help me through</i>

38:37.190 --> 38:41.104
<i>And my destination</i>

38:41.694 --> 38:45.608
<i>Makes it worth the while</i>

38:46.366 --> 38:50.280
<i>Pushing through the darkness</i>

38:50.995 --> 38:54.830
<i>Still another mile</i>

38:58.962 --> 39:00.248
Do you think she'd like it?

39:00.505 --> 39:02.588
- Oh, Sophie.
- Sophie.

39:04.467 --> 39:07.255
Oh, no.
He said this might happen.

39:24.070 --> 39:25.070
Hello.

39:40.086 --> 39:41.086
Hey.

39:41.421 --> 39:42.457
Whoa.

39:52.181 --> 39:54.719
Wait there, okay?
I'll be back, okay?

40:08.197 --> 40:09.608
Stop! Stop!

40:10.700 --> 40:11.816
Can I help?

40:15.705 --> 40:17.662
I've got it!
Tie up the ropes!

40:24.130 --> 40:25.130
You got it?

40:30.553 --> 40:33.296
- You got a plan?
- Oh, absolutely. I'm a trained veterinarian.

40:33.765 --> 40:35.927
- Really?
- No. No, I'm an architect.

40:36.017 --> 40:37.883
But don't tell this guy that.

40:37.977 --> 40:39.468
- Whoa. Okay.
- Whoa.

40:39.562 --> 40:41.303
I'll distract him.
You grab the halter.

40:41.397 --> 40:43.855
Good plan.
What's the halter?

40:45.526 --> 40:46.642
Just talk calmly.

40:47.153 --> 40:48.360
Easier when I'm calm.

40:49.030 --> 40:50.271
All right, my friend.

40:50.615 --> 40:51.947
Storms are scary.

40:52.325 --> 40:56.114
And I wish I was home and dry right now,
too, but believe me,

40:56.537 --> 41:00.872
if it came down to a choice between
leaving you and helping you,

41:00.959 --> 41:03.542
there's no choice at all.

41:05.922 --> 41:08.164
Good boy. Good boy.

41:08.716 --> 41:11.379
Good boy. Good boy.

41:21.062 --> 41:24.976
So, uh, we've walked the entire island.
I still haven't seen where you live.

41:26.025 --> 41:28.233
In a shack on a hill.

41:30.154 --> 41:31.634
And what the hell
are you doing there?

41:31.906 --> 41:34.319
Uh... I don't know.
Running away, I guess.

41:35.702 --> 41:37.694
Back home everything
was lined up for me.

41:38.204 --> 41:42.198
A great job and just, you know,
my whole life mapped out.

41:43.459 --> 41:45.419
I wanted to take a break
before I signed up to it.

41:45.920 --> 41:46.956
How about you?

41:48.923 --> 41:51.040
I have absolutely
nothing mapped out.

41:52.051 --> 41:53.792
And no clue
what the future holds.

41:55.304 --> 41:56.886
Enough walking. Let's ride.

42:13.614 --> 42:18.325
So, how come you're here
all alone, saving horses?

42:18.411 --> 42:21.279
Uh, I've been
traveling all my life.

42:21.372 --> 42:25.457
My dad was never in the picture,
and my mom's always on tour.

42:25.543 --> 42:26.659
Oh. She sings?

42:26.753 --> 42:28.494
Sweet as sugarcane.

42:30.131 --> 42:32.544
You know, there's some
great stuff here.

42:33.342 --> 42:35.129
This dress would look
very pretty on...

42:36.387 --> 42:37.969
You really don't know me
at all, do you?

42:38.806 --> 42:40.013
<i>Okay.</i>

42:40.767 --> 42:41.974
<i>Hey!</i>

42:42.518 --> 42:45.977
<i>Kisses of fire
Burning, burning</i>

42:46.064 --> 42:49.478
<i>I'm at the point of
no returning</i>

42:49.567 --> 42:53.186
<i>Kisses of fire,
sweet devotions</i>

42:53.279 --> 42:58.695
<i>Caught in a landslide
of emotions</i>

42:58.785 --> 43:00.572
<i>I've had my share
of love affairs</i>

43:00.661 --> 43:03.825
<i>But they were nothing
compared to this</i>

43:03.915 --> 43:05.998
<i>Ooh</i>

43:06.084 --> 43:07.950
<i>I'm riding higher than the sky</i>

43:08.044 --> 43:09.535
<i>and there is fire
in every kiss...</i>

43:09.629 --> 43:10.915
Oh, my God.

43:11.130 --> 43:12.996
<i>Kisses of fire...</i>

43:13.091 --> 43:15.799
God. This whole place
is incredible.

43:16.010 --> 43:17.546
I am definitely
staying here forever.

43:17.637 --> 43:18.906
Yeah? Your mom
wouldn't miss you?

43:18.930 --> 43:20.967
No, she's not
that kind of a mom.

43:21.057 --> 43:22.138
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't...

43:22.225 --> 43:23.432
Oh!

43:23.518 --> 43:25.601
Oh, this isn't a sob story,
I'm fine.

43:26.604 --> 43:29.563
And it's not easy being a mother.
If it was, fathers would do it.

43:30.483 --> 43:32.315
Well, I wish I could
stay here, too.

43:33.569 --> 43:34.776
When do you go back?

43:36.364 --> 43:41.029
To your fully programmed,
good job, short haircut life?

43:41.452 --> 43:42.452
I have a week.

43:44.455 --> 43:46.321
Listen, about what's
waiting for me back home.

43:46.415 --> 43:47.518
- Hang on.
- There's something...

43:52.672 --> 43:54.083
I'm definitely staying here.

43:55.424 --> 43:57.916
Excuse me.
Are you the owner?

43:58.970 --> 43:59.970
My son the owner.

44:00.429 --> 44:03.718
He had to buy bar, because no
other place let his band play.

44:04.976 --> 44:06.137
Hello.

44:06.727 --> 44:08.059
So, how can I help you?

44:08.146 --> 44:11.856
Well, firstly,
you're all awesome.

44:12.024 --> 44:14.061
- Oh!
- And second,

44:14.152 --> 44:16.735
I'd like to sing here sometime
with my group.

44:17.864 --> 44:18.900
You have good voice?

44:18.990 --> 44:20.481
Oh, sweet as sugarcane.

44:22.285 --> 44:23.366
Then let us hear.

44:24.787 --> 44:26.995
Oh, no. Not just like that.

44:27.248 --> 44:30.082
Here on island,
everything just like that.

44:30.168 --> 44:31.955
It's the path to happiness.

44:32.420 --> 44:34.707
You think too much,
you get unhappy.

44:35.339 --> 44:37.752
Thinking at all
is pretty much...

44:38.426 --> 44:39.917
A mistake.

44:43.598 --> 44:44.679
Well, in that case...

44:46.726 --> 44:47.762
Uh...

44:48.436 --> 44:49.472
Okay.

44:51.939 --> 44:54.602
<i>Take it easy</i>

44:56.152 --> 44:58.940
<i>With me, please</i>

45:01.032 --> 45:02.989
<i>Touch me gently</i>

45:03.075 --> 45:07.911
<i>Like a summer evening breeze</i>

45:09.457 --> 45:13.201
<i>Take your time</i>

45:13.753 --> 45:15.836
<i>Make it slow</i>

45:17.381 --> 45:19.794
<i>Andante, andante</i>

45:20.384 --> 45:24.253
<i>Just let the feeling grow</i>

45:25.681 --> 45:31.598
<i>Make your fingers
Soft and light</i>

45:32.688 --> 45:38.810
<i>Let your body be
the velvet of the night</i>

45:39.695 --> 45:45.987
<i>Touch my soul, you know how</i>

45:46.577 --> 45:48.910
<i>Andante, andante</i>

45:48.996 --> 45:52.785
<i>Go slowly with me now</i>

45:53.751 --> 45:55.208
<i>I'm your music</i>

45:55.294 --> 45:57.251
<i>I am your music
And I am your song</i>

45:57.338 --> 46:00.922
<i>I'm your song</i>

46:01.008 --> 46:05.548
<i>Play me time and time again
And make me strong</i>

46:05.638 --> 46:08.130
<i>Play me again
'Cause you're making me strong</i>

46:08.224 --> 46:12.559
<i>Make me sing, make me sound</i>

46:12.645 --> 46:14.728
<i>You make me sing
and you make me</i>

46:14.814 --> 46:17.352
<i>Andante, andante</i>

46:17.441 --> 46:21.025
<i>Tread lightly on my ground</i>

46:21.862 --> 46:24.024
<i>Andante, andante</i>

46:24.115 --> 46:28.029
<i>Oh, please don't let me down</i>

46:30.579 --> 46:31.865
You are hired!

46:31.956 --> 46:34.448
- Really?
- You are very, very, very hired!

46:34.542 --> 46:36.329
- Yes!
- Mama! Come on, come on.

46:39.630 --> 46:46.002
<i>I'm your music,
I'm your song</i>

46:46.929 --> 46:52.891
<i>Play me time and time again
And make me strong</i>

46:53.853 --> 46:59.599
<i>Make me sing, make me sound</i>

47:00.651 --> 47:03.109
<i>Andante, andante</i>

47:03.195 --> 47:06.984
<i>Tread lightly on my ground</i>

47:07.742 --> 47:10.234
<i>Andante, andante</i>

47:10.328 --> 47:13.867
<i>Oh, please don't let me down</i>

47:14.832 --> 47:17.245
<i>Andante, andante</i>

47:17.793 --> 47:19.830
<i>Oh, please</i>

47:21.422 --> 47:25.883
<i>Don't let me down</i>

47:39.440 --> 47:40.959
- Okay, great.
- Yeah, I didn't...

47:43.778 --> 47:44.778
Right.

47:45.696 --> 47:47.779
I just don't think you know
what you're doing.

47:47.865 --> 47:49.197
Oh!

47:49.283 --> 47:52.822
I'm hoping if I keep pulling
on these two bits of wood,

47:53.662 --> 47:55.654
we might eventually
bump into land.

47:55.748 --> 47:56.989
Oh, okay.

47:57.083 --> 48:01.043
There's another little island over there.
I thought we might go for a picnic.

48:02.046 --> 48:03.162
Where's the food?

48:03.255 --> 48:05.963
Oh, you're gonna catch it,
on the way.

48:12.515 --> 48:13.801
Uh...

48:14.433 --> 48:18.848
So, we haven't talked
about last night.

48:20.147 --> 48:21.263
No.

48:21.357 --> 48:24.691
You should know that I never do that,
that fast.

48:25.986 --> 48:29.605
I mean, hardly ever.
Well, sometimes.

48:29.698 --> 48:32.736
A bit recently, in fact.
But, on the whole, not.

48:32.827 --> 48:34.489
I thought it was miraculous.

48:39.208 --> 48:41.541
Um, I'm gonna say
something here,

48:41.627 --> 48:45.166
and you should shut up
as I'm saying it

48:45.256 --> 48:47.589
because you'll think
I'm crazy for a while,

48:48.717 --> 48:53.382
but gradually you'll...
You'll realize I'm right,

48:54.557 --> 48:57.425
and then you'll spend the rest
of your life thanking me

48:57.518 --> 49:00.135
for saving you so much time and
just getting straight to it.

49:00.229 --> 49:01.640
Well, I'm ready.

49:03.941 --> 49:06.775
I wasn't joking yesterday,
I was serious.

49:07.903 --> 49:12.773
I want to stay here,
and I think you should, too.

49:14.285 --> 49:17.449
I think we should make a
choice to do something radical

49:17.538 --> 49:22.249
and wonderful, to live in this
extraordinary place with someone...

49:24.628 --> 49:26.164
Someone miraculous.

49:32.303 --> 49:34.340
I told you, you'd think
it was crazy.

49:38.267 --> 49:41.726
I just don't think it's that
simple. Nothing is.

49:42.855 --> 49:46.314
Everything is,
when you break it down.

49:59.288 --> 50:00.529
I don't think it's crazy.

50:02.833 --> 50:05.541
That'll do, for now.

50:28.150 --> 50:31.143
It's done. It's done.
We're done, it's over.

50:31.237 --> 50:33.650
Sophie, Sophie, my darling,
everything will be okay.

50:33.739 --> 50:36.026
Apart from the fact that the
welcome decorations are down,

50:36.116 --> 50:38.345
the garden is a swimming pool,
the swimming pool is a marsh...

50:38.369 --> 50:40.076
We can take care
of all of that.

50:40.162 --> 50:41.698
The party is still a day away.

50:41.789 --> 50:44.998
What party? I just got a call saying that,
because of the storm last night,

50:45.084 --> 50:47.326
no flights have come
into Athens at all,

50:47.419 --> 50:50.628
so there will be no millionaire
guests at the not-that-grand opening,

50:50.714 --> 50:52.526
which is just as well, because
the band can't get here either

50:52.550 --> 50:53.910
because the ferries
aren't running,

50:53.968 --> 50:58.133
so there will be no one to entertain
all the people that aren't here anyway.

50:58.222 --> 51:00.384
It really is over,
and I've let everybody down.

51:00.474 --> 51:02.056
No, that's not true.

51:02.142 --> 51:03.849
Especially Mom.

51:05.062 --> 51:08.897
Nothing you do could ever let
her down, trust me. I know.

51:11.110 --> 51:12.271
How do you know?

51:16.365 --> 51:19.699
Because I did let her down.

51:23.205 --> 51:28.121
<i>I've seen your eyes,
tender like mine</i>

51:29.336 --> 51:34.252
<i>Only a week since we started</i>

51:35.593 --> 51:40.429
<i>It seems to me
In a short time</i>

51:41.724 --> 51:46.844
<i>I'm getting more open-hearted</i>

51:48.188 --> 51:50.771
<i>I was an impossible case</i>

51:51.358 --> 51:54.192
<i>No one ever could reach me</i>

51:54.486 --> 51:56.899
<i>But I think I can see
in your face</i>

51:57.406 --> 52:00.865
<i>There's a lot
you can teach me</i>

52:00.951 --> 52:05.286
<i>So I wanna know
What's the name of the game?</i>

52:07.541 --> 52:11.911
<i>Does it mean anything to you?</i>

52:15.799 --> 52:18.416
<i>What's the name of the game?</i>

52:19.887 --> 52:23.551
<i>Can you feel it the way I do?</i>

52:24.808 --> 52:30.270
<i>Tell me please
'Cause I have to know</i>

52:30.689 --> 52:36.435
<i>I'm a curious child
Beginning to grow</i>

52:38.572 --> 52:43.363
<i>And you make me talk
And you make me feel</i>

52:44.495 --> 52:50.708
<i>And you make me show
What I'm trying to conceal</i>

52:50.793 --> 52:52.625
<i>- If I trust in you</i>
- Boo!

52:52.711 --> 52:56.170
<i>Would you let me down?</i>

52:56.757 --> 53:03.379
<i>Would you laugh at me
If I said I care for you?</i>

53:06.016 --> 53:09.180
<i>Could you feel
the same way too?</i>

53:09.269 --> 53:13.604
<i>I wanna know, oh, yes
I wanna know</i>

53:14.692 --> 53:16.058
<i>The name of the game</i>

53:17.569 --> 53:19.982
I went after her,
of course I did.

53:23.075 --> 53:25.067
Chased her all the way
back to the farmhouse.

53:25.911 --> 53:27.857
Wait. Donna, Donna.

53:28.288 --> 53:31.372
- Donna, please, just listen to me.
- Love to.

53:31.458 --> 53:33.370
- You will?
- Yeah, of course.

53:33.460 --> 53:36.043
I'll listen while you answer
three questions.

53:37.256 --> 53:39.543
Are you engaged to that
beautiful woman?

53:40.843 --> 53:41.879
Yes.

53:42.386 --> 53:44.218
And did you tell me about it?

53:45.222 --> 53:46.303
No.

53:46.890 --> 53:49.633
And do you seriously think
I could ever forgive you?

53:49.727 --> 53:50.934
- Please, Donna...
- Go.

53:51.019 --> 53:53.682
- Please, just listen to me...
- That is enough listening! Go!

53:58.736 --> 54:05.358
<i>No more carefree laughter</i>

54:07.369 --> 54:14.208
<i>Silence ever after</i>

54:16.503 --> 54:19.416
<i>Walking through an empty house</i>

54:19.506 --> 54:21.964
<i>Tears in my eyes</i>

54:25.304 --> 54:27.762
<i>Here is where the story ends</i>

54:28.682 --> 54:30.674
<i>This is goodbye</i>

54:36.774 --> 54:39.437
<i>Knowing me, knowing you</i>

54:39.693 --> 54:40.729
<i>A-ha</i>

54:40.819 --> 54:46.031
<i>There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you</i>

54:46.116 --> 54:47.357
<i>A-ha</i>

54:47.451 --> 54:50.694
<i>We just have to face it
This time we're through</i>

54:50.788 --> 54:52.908
<i>This time we're through
This time we're really through</i>

54:52.956 --> 54:54.676
<i>This time we're through
We're really through</i>

54:54.750 --> 54:57.834
<i>Breaking up is never easy
I know</i>

54:57.961 --> 55:02.422
<i>- But I have to go
- I have to go This time I have to go</i>

55:02.508 --> 55:07.094
<i>Knowing me, knowing you
It's the best I can do</i>

55:38.377 --> 55:42.121
And now, we turn please
to Clause 47, Item 12.

55:42.798 --> 55:44.835
The wording here is unclear,

55:45.342 --> 55:49.461
especially in reference to
"amortization of accrued assets."

55:50.055 --> 55:53.344
As the assets we discussed are tangible,

55:53.433 --> 55:58.224
I advise the more legitimate
phrase "depreciation" be used henceforth.

55:58.313 --> 55:59.349
And furthermore...

55:59.439 --> 56:01.601
You are bored,
Mr. Bright.

56:04.319 --> 56:05.355
On the contrary.

56:05.863 --> 56:10.028
Nothing I like more than a
good contract negotiation,

56:11.368 --> 56:13.781
especially one that's been going
on for more than 14 hours.

56:13.871 --> 56:17.239
This deal will make your company
the number one in Europe.

56:17.833 --> 56:19.290
Worth taking time, I think.

56:19.376 --> 56:22.460
Absolutely, 14 more hours.
Bring 'em on.

56:24.298 --> 56:25.334
That's a nice picture.

56:26.258 --> 56:30.502
Oh, my wife and daughter.
You have family?

56:30.596 --> 56:32.963
I have a daughter.
The best thing in my life.

56:34.016 --> 56:39.307
So, to continue. Uh...
Clause 47, Item 12.

56:39.688 --> 56:41.771
As we said, the wording
is most unclear...

56:41.857 --> 56:45.567
She really is
the best thing in my life.

56:47.279 --> 56:48.986
This, you already said.

56:50.282 --> 56:53.696
Yes, I'm sorry.
I've just realized something.

56:54.411 --> 56:56.869
What, Mr. Bright?
What did you realize?

56:57.247 --> 57:00.160
It's no use climbing the ladder if
you're on completely the wrong wall.

57:03.211 --> 57:05.731
The contract is marvelous, by the way.
Make any changes you like.

57:05.756 --> 57:07.622
Just sign.
Sign, sign, sign.

57:10.844 --> 57:15.134
His skill in
writing is matched only by his charm,

57:15.223 --> 57:19.888
his sailing expertise,
only by his charisma.

57:20.270 --> 57:26.733
Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in
welcoming the wonderful Bill Anderson.

57:40.082 --> 57:42.074
Oh.

57:42.167 --> 57:44.705
Oh, thank you.
Thank you for the award.

57:47.798 --> 57:49.915
Um, I'd like to thank...

57:53.095 --> 57:56.133
My mother, Alma. Thank you.

57:56.223 --> 57:59.637
<i>Tack,</i> Mama.

57:59.726 --> 58:03.265
And I also have a wife.
She's lovely.

58:03.355 --> 58:05.267
- Hello?
- How's he doing?

58:05.357 --> 58:06.393
<i>His best.</i>

58:06.483 --> 58:10.818
<i>It's one thing to get your twin brother
to take your science exams at school,</i>

58:10.904 --> 58:12.941
but this is a different deal.

58:13.031 --> 58:14.317
<i>It was his idea.</i>

58:14.408 --> 58:16.240
He knows something I forgot.

58:17.202 --> 58:19.239
That family is
all that matters.

58:20.205 --> 58:22.071
Just don't let him
tell the goat story.

58:23.417 --> 58:24.999
There's a very amusing story

58:25.085 --> 58:29.420
that I think you will find really,
really, really amusing.

58:30.173 --> 58:31.414
It's about a goat.

58:37.014 --> 58:39.552
So many bags.
I should've known.

58:39.641 --> 58:40.702
It's not that many...

58:40.726 --> 58:42.843
- Donna?
- Donna?

58:42.936 --> 58:44.518
Donna!

58:45.105 --> 58:46.596
Donna!

58:49.359 --> 58:51.817
Oh, my God!
I see what you mean.

58:51.903 --> 58:54.065
This place is paradise.

58:54.489 --> 58:55.650
I'm so glad you're here.

58:56.825 --> 58:58.691
- What happened?
- Where's the hot architect?

58:58.785 --> 59:01.198
Oh, turns out
he was lying to me.

59:01.705 --> 59:02.991
He's not an architect?

59:04.166 --> 59:07.079
He's engaged, to someone else.

59:08.712 --> 59:13.548
And she looks beautiful,
and now he's gone back to her.

59:15.093 --> 59:16.880
I hate it when they do that.

59:16.970 --> 59:18.086
Okay.

59:20.640 --> 59:22.760
So, I've been
sleeping in this farmhouse.

59:22.851 --> 59:23.967
I don't know who owns it,

59:24.061 --> 59:26.348
but it's the most beautiful
place in the world.

59:26.855 --> 59:28.096
It also has a horse.

59:28.190 --> 59:31.103
Yes, very romantic.
We're taking you home.

59:31.193 --> 59:33.153
Uh, not before
a fabulous performance

59:33.236 --> 59:34.772
by the greatest
girl band in the world.

59:34.863 --> 59:35.944
Yes!

59:36.031 --> 59:37.842
We've brought all of the gear.
Where are we playing?

59:37.866 --> 59:40.324
No, no, no. I can't. I can't.
I'm not in that mood.

59:40.410 --> 59:42.263
Oh, but it will
put you in that mood.

59:42.287 --> 59:43.389
Of course it will.

59:43.413 --> 59:45.575
The floodlights,
the grease paint,

59:45.665 --> 59:47.873
the adrenaline of the crowd.

59:47.959 --> 59:52.795
A thousand descendants of
great Greek warriors cheering

59:52.881 --> 59:57.592
and clapping furiously as the
irresistible beat transforms their bodies

59:57.677 --> 01:00:00.420
into pulsating pillars of flesh!

01:00:14.194 --> 01:00:16.777
I don't know how to sing about
love when I'm not feeling it.

01:00:18.573 --> 01:00:21.862
Then, sing about
what you are feeling.

01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:38.629
<i>I was cheated by you
And I think you know when</i>

01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:46.759
<i>So, I made up my mind
It must come to an end</i>

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:54.190
<i>Look at me now
Will I ever learn?</i>

01:00:54.818 --> 01:01:01.406
<i>I don't know how
But I suddenly lose control</i>

01:01:01.867 --> 01:01:05.861
<i>There's a fire within my soul</i>

01:01:06.037 --> 01:01:08.199
<i>Just one look and
I can hear a bell ring</i>

01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:09.290
Yes, Donna!

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:12.579
<i>One more look
And I forget everything</i>

01:01:12.711 --> 01:01:14.327
<i>Whoa, oh, oh, oh</i>

01:01:14.421 --> 01:01:17.334
<i>Mamma mia, here I go again</i>

01:01:17.424 --> 01:01:21.168
<i>My my, how can I resist you?</i>

01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:24.720
<i>Mamma mia
Does it show again</i>

01:01:24.806 --> 01:01:28.015
<i>My my, just how much
I've missed you?</i>

01:01:28.393 --> 01:01:30.555
<i>Yes, I've been broken-hearted</i>

01:01:30.645 --> 01:01:31.645
That's nice!

01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:34.939
<i>Blue since the day we parted</i>

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:38.643
<i>Why, why did
I ever let you go?</i>

01:01:38.737 --> 01:01:41.730
<i>Mamma mia, now I really know</i>

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:45.608
<i>My my, I should not
have let you go</i>

01:01:46.203 --> 01:01:47.319
Let's go, girls.

01:01:47.412 --> 01:01:48.778
Okay, okay. Excuse me.

01:01:52.334 --> 01:01:56.248
<i>I was angry and
sad About the things that you do</i>

01:01:59.257 --> 01:02:01.840
<i>I can't count all the times</i>

01:02:01.927 --> 01:02:03.404
<i>That I've cried over you</i>

01:02:05.096 --> 01:02:06.096
Yes!

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:07.909
<i>And when you go</i>

01:02:07.933 --> 01:02:10.016
<i>When you slam the door</i>

01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:11.433
<i>I think you know</i>

01:02:11.519 --> 01:02:13.806
<i>That you won't be away
too long</i>

01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:15.638
Donna!
Donna, look! Let's go!

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:17.940
<i>You know that
I'm not that strong</i>

01:02:19.277 --> 01:02:22.486
<i>Just one look and I can
hear a bell ring</i>

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:25.940
<i>One more look
and I forget everything</i>

01:02:26.034 --> 01:02:27.320
<i>Whoa, oh, oh, oh</i>

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:30.949
<i>Mamma mia, here I go again</i>

01:02:31.039 --> 01:02:34.282
<i>My my, how can I resist you?</i>

01:02:34.542 --> 01:02:37.580
<i>Mamma mia, does it show again</i>

01:02:38.004 --> 01:02:41.042
<i>My my, just how much
I've missed you?</i>

01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:44.542
<i>Yes, I've been
broken-hearted</i>

01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:47.929
<i>Blue since the day we parted</i>

01:02:48.556 --> 01:02:51.640
<i>Why, why did
I ever let you go?</i>

01:02:51.893 --> 01:02:55.102
<i>Mamma mia, now I really know</i>

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:57.430
<i>My my, I should not
have let you go</i>

01:02:57.565 --> 01:02:59.022
Donna!

01:02:59.484 --> 01:03:01.100
- Hi there.
- Bill?

01:03:05.407 --> 01:03:07.649
I swear. It's true.

01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:13.616
- My point is...
- I know what your point is.

01:03:13.915 --> 01:03:15.247
You don't know
what my point is.

01:03:15.667 --> 01:03:16.894
Your point is that
you fancy him.

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:19.786
Mmm. You see? You were wrong.

01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:21.962
That's not my point.
It's not that I fancy him.

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.980
My point is, actually,
that I love him and I want to have his babies

01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:27.690
and eventually push him around in a
wheelchair and scatter his ashes.

01:03:29.556 --> 01:03:30.556
I see.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.974
And he likes Donna.
And I don't think that's very fair.

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:35.180
He can help her feel better.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:38.228
Do you know what makes me feel
better when my heart's broken?

01:03:39.107 --> 01:03:41.520
Cake. Why doesn't
she just do that instead?

01:03:41.609 --> 01:03:45.068
Just eat humongous amounts of cake
and leave Hot Scandi Guy to me.

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:49.816
I'm going in.

01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:52.071
No. You're staying out,
sister,

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:54.779
because you love Donna
and you want her happy.

01:03:55.457 --> 01:03:57.323
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

01:03:59.294 --> 01:04:01.160
- This is my friend, Bill.
- Hi.

01:04:01.296 --> 01:04:03.524
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- I've heard nothing about you.

01:04:03.548 --> 01:04:04.629
Hi.

01:04:04.716 --> 01:04:06.298
I brought Donna here
on my boat.

01:04:06.384 --> 01:04:07.420
You've got a boat.

01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:09.092
He's got a boat.

01:04:09.721 --> 01:04:11.678
And then I worried about her,
so I came back.

01:04:11.765 --> 01:04:14.599
He worries. He cares.
And he's got a boat.

01:04:15.602 --> 01:04:17.764
And now, I'm taking her
out to sea again.

01:04:19.814 --> 01:04:22.306
Taking her out to sea again.
In the boat.

01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:24.270
You don't think I should go?

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:25.881
Are you kidding?
Of course, you should.

01:04:26.404 --> 01:04:28.020
Tell her she should go.

01:04:29.991 --> 01:04:32.074
- You should absolutely go.
- That's what I'm saying.

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:33.971
I'm saying it, too. Go.

01:04:33.995 --> 01:04:35.736
- Go. And do everything I would do.
- Go.

01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:37.366
Nearly everything. I'm sorry.

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:41.288
Thanks, guys.
I'll be back soon.

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:43.290
- Bye, darling.
- Bye.

01:04:48.968 --> 01:04:50.821
- Could I get some cake, please?
- Cake, over here?

01:04:50.845 --> 01:04:52.006
A lot of cake.

01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:53.971
He's not picking up.

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:56.014
I can't even tell him
how wrong it's all gone.

01:04:56.101 --> 01:04:58.263
Do you think he's just
not hearing the phone?

01:04:58.937 --> 01:05:00.553
Or that he's taking it
out of his pocket,

01:05:00.647 --> 01:05:03.811
seeing it's you
and deciding not to answer?

01:05:04.442 --> 01:05:07.150
It's wonderful that you put
that image in her head.

01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:09.895
Bolster, bolster.

01:05:11.616 --> 01:05:13.107
I think
his phone's on silent.

01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:16.539
I don't even know what
I would say to him anyway.

01:05:16.621 --> 01:05:20.615
You would say you love him more
than you love this argument.

01:05:20.708 --> 01:05:22.165
- That's really good.
- I know.

01:05:23.711 --> 01:05:25.373
I love him more than
any argument.

01:05:25.463 --> 01:05:28.080
- Ooh.
- Just wish he was here so I could tell him.

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:31.967
Well, I wish Bill was here,
too, so that I could hit him.

01:05:32.679 --> 01:05:34.341
What did go wrong
with you two?

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:35.597
Ah.

01:05:36.141 --> 01:05:38.633
Well, there was this
other woman hanging around,

01:05:38.726 --> 01:05:41.764
and I asked him about her,
and you know you're in trouble

01:05:41.855 --> 01:05:44.222
when the word "just"
comes before the word "friends."

01:05:44.732 --> 01:05:47.019
That's how most
of my marriages ended, too.

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:49.318
<i>One night</i>

01:05:49.404 --> 01:05:52.488
<i>- I was taking a walk along the
- Along the river</i>

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:54.906
<i>When I saw him
together with a</i>

01:05:54.993 --> 01:05:56.450
<i>With a young girl</i>

01:05:56.536 --> 01:05:58.619
<i>And the look that
he gave her made me</i>

01:05:58.705 --> 01:06:00.071
<i>Made her shiver</i>

01:06:00.165 --> 01:06:05.661
<i>'Cause he always used to
Look at me that way and I...</i>

01:06:05.753 --> 01:06:07.369
<i>And she thought</i>

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:12.300
<i>Maybe she should walk
Right up to her and say</i>

01:06:12.385 --> 01:06:14.342
<i>Ah, ha, ha</i>

01:06:14.429 --> 01:06:19.220
<i>It's a game he likes to play</i>

01:06:19.601 --> 01:06:25.563
<i>Look into his angel eyes
One look and you're hypnotized</i>

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:31.777
<i>He'll take your heart
And you must pay the price</i>

01:06:32.071 --> 01:06:38.363
<i>Look into his angel eyes You'll
think you're in paradise</i>

01:06:38.453 --> 01:06:44.791
<i>And one day you'll find out
He wears a disguise</i>

01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:51.081
<i>Don't look too deep
into those angel eyes</i>

01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:54.629
<i>Oh, no, no, no, no</i>

01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:57.344
<i>Ah, ha, ha</i>

01:06:58.264 --> 01:07:00.551
<i>Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha</i>

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:03.721
<i>Ah, ha, ha</i>

01:07:03.811 --> 01:07:05.302
It's terribly important
to remember...

01:07:05.396 --> 01:07:07.308
<i>Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha</i>

01:07:07.398 --> 01:07:10.061
...just what terrible people
all men are.

01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:11.193
<i>Ah, ha, ha</i>

01:07:11.277 --> 01:07:15.988
<i>Keep thinking 'bout his
Angel eyes I keep thinking</i>

01:07:16.074 --> 01:07:18.031
<i>Ha, ah</i>

01:07:18.117 --> 01:07:22.612
<i>Sometimes when I'm lonely
I sit and think about him</i>

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:26.286
<i>And it hurts to remember
All the good times</i>

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:29.835
<i>When I thought
I could never live without him</i>

01:07:29.921 --> 01:07:34.916
<i>And I wonder does it
have to be the same</i>

01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:38.674
<i>Every time when I see him?</i>

01:07:38.763 --> 01:07:42.131
<i>Will it bring back
all the pain?</i>

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:43.886
<i>Ah, ha, ha</i>

01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:48.061
<i>How can I forget that name?</i>

01:07:53.027 --> 01:07:59.274
<i>Look into his angel eyes
One look and you're hypnotized</i>

01:07:59.534 --> 01:08:05.246
<i>He'll take your heart
And you must pay the price</i>

01:08:05.623 --> 01:08:08.331
<i>Look into his angel eyes</i>

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:11.957
<i>You'll think
you're in paradise</i>

01:08:12.046 --> 01:08:17.212
<i>And one day you'll find out
He wears a disguise</i>

01:08:19.304 --> 01:08:24.925
<i>Don't look too deep
into those angel eyes</i>

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:28.519
<i>Oh, no, no, no, no</i>

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:35.725
Not a single ferry?
You can't be serious.

01:08:35.819 --> 01:08:37.277
I made it all the way
from Stockholm,

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:39.174
spending I don't know how much
on a private plane.

01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:41.564
You can't tell me, now I can't
make it the last few miles.

01:08:44.912 --> 01:08:45.948
What?

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:49.285
Time has been
most cruel to you, sir.

01:08:50.877 --> 01:08:55.792
Your hairline, it disappear.
And your face, it collapse.

01:08:56.841 --> 01:08:58.877
I would suggest we swim for it,
but perhaps not.

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:01.752
Men at our time of life.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:06.173
Sir, in your case,
age becomes you,

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:08.720
as it does the tree,
the wine,

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:11.261
and the cheese.

01:09:12.939 --> 01:09:15.227
Thank you very much.
You're not so bad yourself.

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:16.434
Nah.

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:19.340
I was told you couldn't come.
Why the hell are you here?

01:09:19.363 --> 01:09:20.821
I'm a spontaneous person.

01:09:22.116 --> 01:09:23.716
- No, you're not.
- No, I'm not.

01:09:40.635 --> 01:09:42.843
Oh! That was incredible!

01:09:43.845 --> 01:09:44.990
You wanna see
what's in there?

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:48.006
Oh, it doesn't matter.
Just getting it is reward enough.

01:09:48.475 --> 01:09:49.475
Really?

01:09:50.228 --> 01:09:53.812
No! Are you kidding?
Open it now!

01:09:57.527 --> 01:10:01.191
Drumroll! Got it?

01:10:06.452 --> 01:10:07.452
For you.

01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:11.537
You're very kind.

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:14.332
I have at least 18
ulterior motives.

01:10:19.674 --> 01:10:21.586
There is a lovely little
food store, back there.

01:10:22.385 --> 01:10:26.345
They've got this cake called baklava,
which is layers of pastry

01:10:26.431 --> 01:10:28.191
- filled with chopped...
- You've had enough.

01:10:28.683 --> 01:10:33.348
Somewhere on a boat on the ocean
with someone that isn't me

01:10:33.438 --> 01:10:36.055
is literally the handsomest
man in the world.

01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:37.435
Right, except for this guy.

01:10:39.026 --> 01:10:41.268
Jesus Christ! What kind of
island is this?

01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:42.589
Take this.
Yes, take this.

01:10:44.323 --> 01:10:47.987
Hi. I just want to be upfront and
say that I visually enjoy you.

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:49.113
Oh, that's, uh...

01:10:49.203 --> 01:10:52.617
You! Man! Coming over here!

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.077
- I'm so sorry. Excuse me.
- I'll be waiting.

01:10:56.544 --> 01:10:57.830
Hi. I'm looking for...

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.786
I know who you looking for,

01:10:59.881 --> 01:11:02.669
with your wandering eye
and restless groin.

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:06.336
I should cut it off,
the way you hurt that precious angel.

01:11:06.429 --> 01:11:07.465
I know. I know.

01:11:07.555 --> 01:11:11.765
But she pick herself up after
you tearing her heartstrings.

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:16.725
She leave on a boat with
most famous stud in Europe.

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:19.564
And I would not
wait for return.

01:11:20.693 --> 01:11:25.529
Man has so many notch on his bedpost,
the bed fall down.

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:30.784
It's called karma.
And it's pronounced, "Ha!"

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:36.949
Yeah. I deserve that.

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:38.937
Okay, he's coming back.
Tell me I look good.

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:40.202
You always look good.

01:11:40.338 --> 01:11:41.982
- You're meant to be bolstering me.
- I'm sorry.

01:11:42.006 --> 01:11:45.374
- So, bolster, bolster.
- All right, you look so beautiful...

01:11:45.468 --> 01:11:46.549
Whatever!

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:49.879
My point is, I don't even mind
if you're not rich. I say...

01:11:54.894 --> 01:11:56.205
- Where was that cake now?
- Just back there.

01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:57.229
- Let's go.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:41.638
I just wanted to say it was very
nice when you turned up today.

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:44.061
I'm glad I could help.

01:12:44.944 --> 01:12:45.944
Thank you.

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.577
- Good night then.
- Good night.

01:13:02.795 --> 01:13:04.002
I was just really sad.

01:13:04.839 --> 01:13:05.839
I know.

01:13:07.091 --> 01:13:08.753
- Men are pigs.
- All of us.

01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:12.878
Which is not to say
I don't like pigs,

01:13:13.848 --> 01:13:16.966
I do like them.
I mean, I wouldn't want one as a pet...

01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:18.220
Just get over here.

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:25.565
I don't understand how
this gets us to the island.

01:13:26.527 --> 01:13:27.859
It's a little trick I learned.

01:13:27.945 --> 01:13:31.154
When faced with a problem,
you literally strap yourself down,

01:13:32.033 --> 01:13:33.490
can't get up till it's solved.

01:13:34.118 --> 01:13:35.154
Oh.

01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:37.781
Well, let's put it
to the test.

01:13:40.541 --> 01:13:42.328
- Too tight?
- By no means.

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:44.500
Hey, you remember me?

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:48.418
I'm a man in my 50s.
Most days I don't remember my own name.

01:13:49.008 --> 01:13:50.715
Perhaps this remind you...

01:13:53.888 --> 01:13:55.925
Apollonia!

01:13:56.015 --> 01:13:57.381
Alexio!

01:13:59.477 --> 01:14:00.888
Listen, everyone!

01:14:00.978 --> 01:14:06.190
Many moon ago, this great man save my life,
by saving my love.

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:10.519
Ah, it was nothing!
Anybody would've done the same! Yeah.

01:14:12.031 --> 01:14:13.031
Tough crowd.

01:14:13.866 --> 01:14:17.530
These are difficult days for them.
For all us fishermen.

01:14:18.412 --> 01:14:19.448
For many years now,

01:14:19.538 --> 01:14:21.621
we do more and more work
for less and less pay.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:28.087
Now our boats lie idle and we drink in
joyless surrender to our economic fate.

01:14:30.216 --> 01:14:34.961
Well, in that case, maybe all of you
want to come to a very expensive party?

01:14:35.054 --> 01:14:36.090
Totally free.

01:14:36.681 --> 01:14:37.717
- A party?
- Yeah.

01:14:45.106 --> 01:14:46.768
And bring your wives
and family!

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:49.683
Oh! Come on!

01:14:50.069 --> 01:14:51.435
Uh, just a minute.

01:14:51.529 --> 01:14:54.943
I just seem to have, um,
tied this a little tight at the...

01:14:55.032 --> 01:14:59.823
Excuse me! Hello? I just...
Anyone! Hello?

01:15:08.004 --> 01:15:09.004
Need some help?

01:15:11.799 --> 01:15:15.759
No guests, just us
and a mountain of food.

01:15:16.429 --> 01:15:20.924
I'm beginning to think my
soulmate may actually be carbs.

01:15:21.475 --> 01:15:22.932
Then mine must be wine.

01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:24.767
And Sky is mine.

01:15:26.939 --> 01:15:29.352
Maybe he's right.
Maybe I should leave this island.

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:32.063
Sophie, listen.

01:15:33.154 --> 01:15:37.524
Your mother was the bravest
person we ever met.

01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:39.357
And if she taught
you anything,

01:15:39.452 --> 01:15:42.445
it's that it's your choice how
to live the rest of your life.

01:15:42.997 --> 01:15:45.364
Do what makes
your soul shine.

01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:49.544
I'll try.

01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:56.709
- Nailed it.
- To the wall, baby.

01:15:56.802 --> 01:15:57.838
Yay.

01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:02.013
- It's going to be a beautiful night.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:16:02.099 --> 01:16:04.386
Just wish I had someone
to share it with.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.472
Oh, come on.
We have each other.

01:16:07.354 --> 01:16:10.643
Oh, I think we've got
more than that. Take a look.

01:16:19.617 --> 01:16:21.529
- It's Bill and Harry.
- No.

01:16:28.334 --> 01:16:30.792
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

01:16:30.878 --> 01:16:35.873
<i>You can dance, you can jive</i>

01:16:35.966 --> 01:16:39.425
<i>Having the time of your life</i>

01:16:39.512 --> 01:16:44.678

01:16:49.897 --> 01:16:51.513
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah</i>

01:16:54.902 --> 01:16:58.691
<i>Friday night
and the lights are low</i>

01:16:59.949 --> 01:17:03.067
<i>Looking out for a place to go</i>

01:17:04.537 --> 01:17:06.870
<i>Where they play
the right music</i>

01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:08.868
<i>Getting in the swing</i>

01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:11.621
<i>You come to look for a king</i>

01:17:14.213 --> 01:17:18.378
<i>Anybody could be that guy</i>

01:17:19.051 --> 01:17:23.261
<i>Night is young
And the music's high</i>

01:17:23.681 --> 01:17:27.971
<i>With a bit of rock music
Everything's fine</i>

01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:31.019
<i>You're in the mood for a dance</i>

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:36.900
<i>And when you get the chance</i>

01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:40.229
<i>You are the dancing queen</i>

01:17:40.698 --> 01:17:45.739
<i>Young and sweet
Only seventeen</i>

01:17:45.828 --> 01:17:47.069
Phew.

01:17:47.955 --> 01:17:50.163
<i>Dancing queen</i>

01:17:50.249 --> 01:17:54.493
<i>Feel the beat
from the tambourine</i>

01:17:54.587 --> 01:17:57.045
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

01:17:57.673 --> 01:18:02.168
<i>You can dance, you can jive</i>

01:18:02.261 --> 01:18:05.754

<i>See that girl

<i>Digging the dancing queen</i>

01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:29.699
<i>You're a teaser
You turn 'em on</i>

01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:33.410
<i>Leave them burning</i>

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:35.287
<i>And then you're gone</i>

01:18:35.961 --> 01:18:39.875
<i>Looking out for another
Anyone will do</i>

01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:43.050
<i>You're in the mood for a dance</i>

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:48.593

Yeah!

01:18:59.944 --> 01:19:01.936

01:19:02.321 --> 01:19:06.440

01:19:27.846 --> 01:19:29.178
Oh, yeah! Thank you.

01:19:29.265 --> 01:19:30.472
Ah!

01:19:30.557 --> 01:19:32.469
Thank you for coming.
Thank you. Thank you.

01:19:33.018 --> 01:19:34.099
Have a look.

01:19:34.186 --> 01:19:37.520
- Oh!
<i>- Digging the dancing queen</i>

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:38.642
Hi!

01:19:40.192 --> 01:19:42.024
Oh!

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:44.102
<i>Digging the dancing queen</i>

01:19:44.196 --> 01:19:45.196
Look.

01:19:45.781 --> 01:19:46.781
Sky!

01:19:59.586 --> 01:20:01.426
Fairly obviously,
they're not all millionaires.

01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:02.983
- I don't care.
- And there's no press, there won't be

01:20:03.007 --> 01:20:04.734
- any coverage of the evening.
- I don't care.

01:20:04.758 --> 01:20:06.653
And I could only book
the worst band in the world.

01:20:06.677 --> 01:20:07.862
They're a great band

01:20:07.886 --> 01:20:09.252
and I don't care
about any of it.

01:20:09.346 --> 01:20:10.991
- You got here.
- And I'm never leaving again.

01:20:11.015 --> 01:20:12.575
I don't care about the job
or New York or anything.

01:20:12.599 --> 01:20:14.160
I don't care
about anything that isn't you.

01:20:14.184 --> 01:20:16.927
<i>Se√±or</i> Cienfuegos,
the party is still happening.

01:20:17.021 --> 01:20:18.353
I will look after
the fireworks.

01:20:18.439 --> 01:20:20.806
Sky's here and these are
my other two dads.

01:20:21.317 --> 01:20:23.980
Of course it takes three great
men to create such a woman.

01:20:25.863 --> 01:20:27.149
It's a pleasure
to be of service.

01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:35.029
My God, Sophie,
look what you've done with the place.

01:20:35.122 --> 01:20:36.863
She wanted to make
her mom proud.

01:20:36.957 --> 01:20:38.539
As if she hasn't done that
all her life.

01:20:58.604 --> 01:20:59.720
Excuse me a minute.

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:05.684
Here's to us.
May the rest of our lives

01:21:05.778 --> 01:21:07.064
be the best of our lives.

01:21:07.154 --> 01:21:09.146
- Oh. Cheers.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:21:11.283 --> 01:21:12.524
You're not drinking.

01:21:12.618 --> 01:21:13.779
- She's missing her man.
- Oh.

01:21:14.787 --> 01:21:15.787
Which one?

01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:17.696
Oh, yeah,
that's the big question.

01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:20.202
- What?
- Oh, it doesn't matter.

01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:23.952
- Who want more vine leaves?
- Mmm, definitely not.

01:21:24.046 --> 01:21:27.539
I'll have some more.
It's the last time, we leave tomorrow.

01:21:28.509 --> 01:21:30.171
- All of you?
- All of us.

01:21:30.677 --> 01:21:31.677
Except me.

01:21:32.679 --> 01:21:33.760
- Really?
- Really?

01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:35.426
You don't have to.

01:21:36.392 --> 01:21:37.392
Really?

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:40.302
That farmhouse on the hill
you're sleeping in,

01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:41.852
who you think own it?

01:21:42.189 --> 01:21:43.189
I...

01:21:43.273 --> 01:21:45.560
I do. Me.

01:21:45.651 --> 01:21:48.985
I know it's run down,
but my son is no help.

01:21:49.071 --> 01:21:51.188
He put all his energy
into that horrible band.

01:21:51.281 --> 01:21:52.692
They're a great band.

01:21:54.159 --> 01:21:55.570
Your ears are cloth.

01:21:56.245 --> 01:22:00.159
But, uh, if you live there
and make it beautiful...

01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:02.540
You can stay for free.

01:22:02.626 --> 01:22:04.208
Donna, seriously, don't.

01:22:04.545 --> 01:22:06.662
There is a whole world
out there.

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:08.337
There's one right here.

01:22:10.342 --> 01:22:14.461
I'd love to stay.
I'd love nothing more.

01:22:15.222 --> 01:22:17.259
And I could do
amazing things with it.

01:22:17.349 --> 01:22:19.069
You know, maybe one day
it could be a hotel,

01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:20.762
it could be incredible.

01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:24.179
But you hardly know me.

01:22:25.065 --> 01:22:29.605
Because I judge a person's heart
by the way they treat animal.

01:22:30.571 --> 01:22:32.904
And you are kind to Hector,
my horse.

01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:36.859
And your son, who is
also an animal.

01:22:38.036 --> 01:22:40.824
I'm overwhelmed.
I don't know...

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:44.123
Excuse me just one second.

01:22:46.962 --> 01:22:49.170
Well, I did say that
that mutaka smelt funny.

01:22:49.756 --> 01:22:51.372
- Moussaka.
- Bless you.

01:23:02.811 --> 01:23:06.270
Okay. I think we know
what that means.

01:23:08.734 --> 01:23:12.444
Soph! There you are. I've just
been speaking to this guy.

01:23:12.863 --> 01:23:15.675
He's actually a journalist and he wants
to write about this place for his blog.

01:23:15.699 --> 01:23:17.135
- Which means, it could be the start...
- I don't care.

01:23:17.159 --> 01:23:20.027
- No, I know. You keep saying that...
- Sky, listen to me.

01:23:21.246 --> 01:23:22.246
What?

01:23:24.791 --> 01:23:27.249
I have never felt
closer to my mom.

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:28.872
I know.

01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:32.650
It's being in this place with
her photos on the walls and...

01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:33.674
I'm pregnant.

01:23:36.762 --> 01:23:37.762
What?

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:40.589
In exactly the same place
that she was.

01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:43.891
Only this time we know
who the father is.

01:23:43.977 --> 01:23:45.093
Soph, you're pregnant?

01:23:45.187 --> 01:23:50.023
Yeah, I am. And I have you
and my three dads.

01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:55.148
And she had nobody. She didn't
even have anybody to tell.

01:23:56.156 --> 01:23:57.567
She must've been so scared.

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:02.243
All right. Bye.

01:24:06.833 --> 01:24:07.869
- Bye!
- Mwah!

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:10.794
<i>She wasn't scared.
I know that now.</i>

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:13.166
<i>She knew that she could do it.</i>

01:24:13.257 --> 01:24:15.544
<i>Because she wasn't alone.</i>

01:24:15.634 --> 01:24:16.875
She had me.

01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:19.711
- And you have me.
- Yeah.

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:23.973
Oh, we can't tell anybody
about the baby.

01:24:24.059 --> 01:24:26.893
We have to wait until at least
the twelve-week scan.

01:24:26.979 --> 01:24:28.345
Right.

01:24:28.438 --> 01:24:29.519
- What is that?
- What?

01:24:31.984 --> 01:24:32.984
That noise.

01:24:57.509 --> 01:25:03.050
<i>Where is the spring And the summer</i>

01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:06.975
<i>That once was yours and mine?</i>

01:25:08.854 --> 01:25:13.394
<i>Where did it go?
I just don't know</i>

01:25:13.483 --> 01:25:16.066
You're at the party,
but you're not in the party.

01:25:16.486 --> 01:25:19.570
I've been dancing,
just not with you.

01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:23.859
Dance with me now.
And never, ever stop.

01:25:25.662 --> 01:25:27.198
I gave you
your chance, Bill.

01:25:28.999 --> 01:25:30.331
I'm asking you for one more.

01:25:30.417 --> 01:25:33.831
Well... It's just not
gonna work, is it?

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:35.600
If you haven't learned
from the first time.

01:25:35.631 --> 01:25:37.748
Oh. Believe me
when I say I have.

01:25:37.841 --> 01:25:39.252
I never believe you, Bill.

01:25:39.343 --> 01:25:42.677
Your pants are a raging wildfire
that cannot be contained.

01:25:42.763 --> 01:25:45.506
Not anymore. I've changed.

01:25:48.894 --> 01:25:50.601
For that to ever happen,

01:25:50.687 --> 01:25:54.306
something would have to really
break down your barricades.

01:25:54.691 --> 01:25:56.774
Force you to feel some
real pain and loss

01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:59.944
for the first time
in your shallow, playboy life.

01:26:00.322 --> 01:26:02.814
And that is never
gonna happen.

01:26:03.867 --> 01:26:06.154
So, all we can be now
is friends.

01:26:07.371 --> 01:26:09.611
And you're just gonna have
to start getting used to that.

01:26:10.290 --> 01:26:12.657
You're very strong, Rosie.

01:26:15.504 --> 01:26:16.504
Finally.

01:26:22.719 --> 01:26:25.132
She'd have really loved
all this, wouldn't she?

01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:28.015
Who?

01:26:28.809 --> 01:26:29.809
Donna.

01:26:43.699 --> 01:26:48.160
Oh, my love. Oh, no.
Come here, come here.

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:08.845
Come on, this way,
just keep walking.

01:27:08.932 --> 01:27:11.299
You better not
have some kind of surprise lined up.

01:27:11.393 --> 01:27:14.727
- No, not at all. No. Why?
- I hate surprises.

01:27:14.813 --> 01:27:16.145
I thought you loved surprises.

01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:17.972
Yeah, but it's already
too much.

01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:20.103
The party not happening
and then happening

01:27:20.193 --> 01:27:22.025
and then you showing up
and the pregnancy.

01:27:22.112 --> 01:27:26.732
It's all amazing, but I'm so
incredibly crazy overwhelmed right now

01:27:26.825 --> 01:27:29.693
that I don't want anything
remotely shocking

01:27:29.786 --> 01:27:32.654
or different to happen
in the next decade.

01:27:32.748 --> 01:27:33.909
Yes.

01:27:33.999 --> 01:27:35.661
What?

01:27:36.585 --> 01:27:37.585
Too late.

01:27:52.726 --> 01:27:54.308
Let the party commence!

01:27:56.897 --> 01:28:00.481
Grandma, you weren't invited.

01:28:02.027 --> 01:28:04.019
That's the best kind
of party, little girl.

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:09.152
So, Sky got you here.

01:28:09.242 --> 01:28:12.326
No, Sky just helped it happen.
You got me here.

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:13.954
What do you mean?

01:28:14.039 --> 01:28:18.659
I've decided to commit
to being "a grandmother."

01:28:20.796 --> 01:28:24.005
It's 25 years too late.

01:28:24.090 --> 01:28:25.422
I say we move past that.

01:28:26.176 --> 01:28:29.044
You know, Soph, being
a grudge-holder makes you fat.

01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:32.297
So, let's just concentrate
on the here and now,

01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:35.303
and me stepping up to
becoming a good grandmother.

01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:37.225
A great grandmother.

01:28:37.312 --> 01:28:38.393
Thank you.

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:41.314
No, he's saying that...
Wait, how did you know?

01:28:41.733 --> 01:28:45.647
- Sky?
- I didn't say anything. We agreed. Soph.

01:28:45.737 --> 01:28:48.571
I only told Sam,
because he's my stepfather

01:28:48.657 --> 01:28:50.740
and also one-third
of my real father.

01:28:50.826 --> 01:28:52.783
I just told Bill.
He's my best friend.

01:28:52.869 --> 01:28:55.031
And, I told Harry.
He's father number three.

01:28:55.121 --> 01:28:57.989
I told many,
many people.

01:28:58.542 --> 01:29:00.739
Excuse us,
ladies and gentlemen!

01:29:01.461 --> 01:29:04.954
Rosie and I would like
to propose a toast

01:29:05.048 --> 01:29:08.541
to the woman of this
and every hour.

01:29:08.635 --> 01:29:11.127
You're too kind.

01:29:11.972 --> 01:29:13.008
They mean Sophie.

01:29:13.098 --> 01:29:14.179
I knew that.

01:29:14.266 --> 01:29:15.473
Come on up, Sophie.

01:29:21.231 --> 01:29:26.943
I just want to say, for a while now I
have been living my mother's wishes.

01:29:27.028 --> 01:29:28.735
And, tonight,
they've come true,

01:29:29.573 --> 01:29:34.113
with this, and with this.

01:29:34.661 --> 01:29:37.870
Great-grandmother. I'll be
leaving that out of the bio.

01:29:37.956 --> 01:29:41.370
And now I can fulfill
one of my greatest wishes.

01:29:42.085 --> 01:29:46.921
Ever since I was a child,
I wanted once, just once,

01:29:47.591 --> 01:29:49.799
to be a part of
Donna and the Dynamos.

01:29:50.135 --> 01:29:52.127
Yeah!

01:29:53.096 --> 01:29:54.758
You're gonna be so great.

01:29:57.601 --> 01:29:59.058
Do it for your mom, baby.

01:30:03.315 --> 01:30:07.229
<i>I, I have known love before</i>

01:30:08.194 --> 01:30:10.527
<i>I thought it would no more</i>

01:30:11.364 --> 01:30:15.233
<i>Take on a new direction</i>

01:30:16.161 --> 01:30:20.030
<i>Still, strange as it
seems to be</i>

01:30:20.957 --> 01:30:22.994
<i>It's truly new to me</i>

01:30:24.878 --> 01:30:28.212
<i>That affection</i>

01:30:28.548 --> 01:30:32.713
<i>I, I don't know what you do</i>

01:30:33.345 --> 01:30:35.803
<i>You make me think that you</i>

01:30:36.556 --> 01:30:40.675
<i>Will change my life forever</i>

01:30:41.311 --> 01:30:44.930
<i>I, I'll always want you near</i>

01:30:45.941 --> 01:30:48.149
<i>Give up on you, my dear</i>

01:30:49.736 --> 01:30:53.025
<i>I will never</i>

01:30:54.157 --> 01:30:57.241
<i>You thrill me, you delight me</i>

01:30:57.327 --> 01:31:00.195
<i>You please me, you excite me</i>

01:31:00.288 --> 01:31:03.827
<i>You're all that
I've been yearning for</i>

01:31:06.670 --> 01:31:09.162
<i>I love you, I adore you</i>

01:31:09.798 --> 01:31:12.381
<i>I lay my life before you</i>

01:31:12.842 --> 01:31:16.051
<i>I only want you more and more</i>

01:31:19.015 --> 01:31:23.726
<i>And finally, it seems
My lonely days are through</i>

01:31:24.729 --> 01:31:30.066
<i>I've been waiting for you</i>

01:31:37.242 --> 01:31:41.077
<i>I'll carry you all the way</i>

01:31:41.955 --> 01:31:44.163
<i>And you will choose the day</i>

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:49.040
<i>When you're prepared
to greet me</i>

01:31:49.713 --> 01:31:53.673
<i>I'll be a good mom, I swear</i>

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:56.834
<i>You'll see how much I care</i>

01:31:58.179 --> 01:32:01.047
<i>When you meet me</i>

01:32:02.434 --> 01:32:05.552
<i>You thrill me, you delight me</i>

01:32:05.645 --> 01:32:08.729
<i>You please me, you excite me</i>

01:32:08.815 --> 01:32:12.149
<i>You're all that
I've been yearning for</i>

01:32:14.946 --> 01:32:17.905
<i>I love you, I adore you</i>

01:32:17.991 --> 01:32:24.113
<i>I lay my life before you
I only want you more and more</i>

01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:31.995
<i>And finally it seems
My lonely days are through</i>

01:32:33.006 --> 01:32:37.967
<i>I've been waiting for you</i>

01:32:38.053 --> 01:32:43.094
<i>Oh, I've been waiting</i>

01:32:43.892 --> 01:32:49.854
<i>For you</i>

01:33:08.792 --> 01:33:11.079
Not bad. You gotta work
on your breathing

01:33:11.169 --> 01:33:12.705
and you were
a little pitchy...

01:33:14.714 --> 01:33:18.674
Is what I would say
if I wasn't a loving relative.

01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:20.342
Speaking as a grandmother?

01:33:20.428 --> 01:33:22.215
I'm so proud
I could combust.

01:33:23.515 --> 01:33:25.177
You've got glitter
in your veins.

01:33:25.266 --> 01:33:26.757
You got it from me.

01:33:26.851 --> 01:33:28.262
Now, I need to find Sky

01:33:28.353 --> 01:33:30.094
because he and I
were gonna talk about you.

01:33:30.688 --> 01:33:33.522
Where is <i>Se√±or</i> Cienfuegos?
He'll know where Sky is.

01:33:33.858 --> 01:33:37.226
Cienfuegos?
That's an unusual name.

01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:40.939
He's an unusual man.
See for yourself.

01:33:45.328 --> 01:33:46.328
Ruby!

01:33:47.705 --> 01:33:48.866
Fernando!

01:33:56.631 --> 01:34:00.215
<i>Mi amor</i>. Mexico, 1959.

01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:05.088
<i>Can you hear
the drums, Fernando?</i>

01:34:06.975 --> 01:34:08.841
<i>I remember long ago</i>

01:34:08.935 --> 01:34:12.019
<i>Another starry night like this</i>

01:34:13.982 --> 01:34:16.895
<i>In the firelight, Fernando</i>

01:34:18.695 --> 01:34:20.527
<i>You were humming to yourself</i>

01:34:20.613 --> 01:34:23.481
<i>And softly strumming
your guitar</i>

01:34:23.575 --> 01:34:25.335
<i>I could hear the distant drums</i>

01:34:25.410 --> 01:34:29.825
<i>And sounds of bugle calls
Were coming from afar</i>

01:34:31.666 --> 01:34:34.454
<i>They were closer now, Fernando</i>

01:34:36.337 --> 01:34:41.674
<i>Every hour, every minute
Seemed to last eternally</i>

01:34:43.136 --> 01:34:46.345
<i>I was so afraid, Fernando</i>

01:34:48.099 --> 01:34:49.965
<i>We were young and full of life</i>

01:34:50.059 --> 01:34:52.722
<i>And none of us prepared to die</i>

01:34:52.812 --> 01:34:54.644
<i>And I'm not ashamed to say</i>

01:34:54.731 --> 01:34:59.351
<i>The roar of guns and cannons
Almost made me cry</i>

01:35:00.778 --> 01:35:04.067
<i>There was something
In the air that night</i>

01:35:04.157 --> 01:35:08.151
<i>The stars were bright,
Fernando</i>

01:35:09.537 --> 01:35:12.621
<i>They were shining there
For you and me</i>

01:35:12.707 --> 01:35:17.042
<i>For liberty, Fernando</i>

01:35:17.128 --> 01:35:20.792
<i>Though we never thought
That we could lose</i>

01:35:20.882 --> 01:35:22.464
<i>There's no regret</i>

01:35:24.761 --> 01:35:27.879
<i>If I had to do the same again</i>

01:35:27.972 --> 01:35:31.682
<i>I would, my friend, Fernando</i>

01:35:33.228 --> 01:35:36.642
<i>If I had to do the same again</i>

01:35:36.731 --> 01:35:40.315
<i>I would, my friend, Fernando</i>

01:35:55.625 --> 01:35:58.584
<i>Now we're old and gray,
Fernando</i>

01:36:00.171 --> 01:36:05.508
<i>Since many years I haven't
seen a rifle in your hand</i>

01:36:07.095 --> 01:36:10.304
<i>Can you hear the drums,
Fernando?</i>

01:36:11.766 --> 01:36:13.974
<i>Do you still recall
the fateful night</i>

01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:16.143
<i>We crossed the Rio Grande</i>

01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:18.266
<i>I can see it in your eyes</i>

01:36:18.356 --> 01:36:22.475
<i>How proud you were to fight
For freedom in this land</i>

01:36:24.237 --> 01:36:27.355
<i>There was something
In the air that night</i>

01:36:27.448 --> 01:36:31.567
<i>The stars were bright,
Fernando</i>

01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:35.488
<i>They were shining there
For you and me</i>

01:36:35.581 --> 01:36:39.871
<i>For liberty, Fernando</i>

01:36:39.961 --> 01:36:43.671
<i>Though we never thought
That we could lose</i>

01:36:43.756 --> 01:36:45.668
<i>There's no regret</i>

01:36:47.468 --> 01:36:50.506
<i>If I had to do the same again</i>

01:36:50.596 --> 01:36:54.215
<i>I would, my friend, Fernando</i>

01:36:55.685 --> 01:36:58.723
<i>Yes, if I had to do
the same again</i>

01:36:58.813 --> 01:37:03.558
<i>I would, my friend, Fernando</i>

01:37:22.337 --> 01:37:24.624
I'm just saying
he has my ears.

01:37:24.714 --> 01:37:26.580
And I'm just asking
why you care.

01:37:26.674 --> 01:37:28.360
- I don't care, I absolutely don't.
- Good.

01:37:28.384 --> 01:37:31.923
We're, all three of us,
grandfathers and that's that. That's fine.

01:37:32.013 --> 01:37:33.174
Yes, it's fine.

01:37:33.264 --> 01:37:35.130
It's just,
over the years,

01:37:35.224 --> 01:37:38.262
people have tended to be extremely
complimentary about my ears.

01:37:38.353 --> 01:37:39.434
Oh, yeah.

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:41.261
People have complimented
your ears?

01:37:41.356 --> 01:37:43.643
To such an extent that I hope
he's inherited them.

01:37:44.025 --> 01:37:45.025
The boy.

01:37:45.109 --> 01:37:46.316
- Yes.
- Donny.

01:37:46.402 --> 01:37:48.314
- That's right.
- He does have lovely ears.

01:37:48.404 --> 01:37:51.818
But I've also noticed that
he has rather piercing blue eyes.

01:37:51.908 --> 01:37:52.989
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:37:53.076 --> 01:37:55.159
What about
his beautifully shaped feet?

01:37:55.244 --> 01:37:56.576
You're not taking
your shoes off.

01:37:57.997 --> 01:37:59.078
- Ah!
- Hey.

01:37:59.165 --> 01:38:01.873
That walk gets longer
every time we do it.

01:38:01.959 --> 01:38:05.043
Yeah, but it's worth it
for what's at the top.

01:38:06.798 --> 01:38:09.632
Fine, rub my tired
single nose in it.

01:38:09.717 --> 01:38:11.083
- Hi, <i>ciao!
- Ciao!</i>

01:38:11.177 --> 01:38:12.213
- Hey!
- Hi!

01:38:12.303 --> 01:38:14.295
Well, you two look
obscenely happy.

01:38:14.389 --> 01:38:16.676
She has turned
my frown upside down.

01:38:22.063 --> 01:38:25.773
Oh, and I'd like to introduce you
to the other great love of my life,

01:38:26.067 --> 01:38:28.400
my brother,
Don Raphael Cienfuegos.

01:38:30.863 --> 01:38:33.105
Oh, God, I hope
his wife is dead.

01:38:33.199 --> 01:38:38.285
Alas, she is, and I fear I shall
never find happiness again.

01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:40.366
Think again, brother.

01:38:41.457 --> 01:38:43.540
Well, come on everybody.
Let's do this.

01:38:47.588 --> 01:38:48.920
A day to remember, huh?

01:38:56.013 --> 01:38:57.345
I wish she was here.

01:39:00.685 --> 01:39:01.685
She is.

01:39:28.463 --> 01:39:32.924
<i>I've never felt this strong</i>

01:39:34.802 --> 01:39:40.139
<i>I'm invincible,
how could this go wrong?</i>

01:39:40.224 --> 01:39:46.562
<i>No, here,
here's where we belong</i>

01:39:48.024 --> 01:39:52.940
<i>I see a road ahead</i>

01:39:54.489 --> 01:40:00.781
<i>I never thought
I would dare to tread</i>

01:40:05.166 --> 01:40:08.500
<i>Like an image passing by</i>

01:40:08.878 --> 01:40:11.837
<i>My love, my life</i>

01:40:11.923 --> 01:40:15.166
<i>In the mirror of your eyes</i>

01:40:15.259 --> 01:40:17.967
<i>My love, my life</i>

01:40:18.471 --> 01:40:22.306
<i>I can see it all so clearly</i>

01:40:22.391 --> 01:40:26.351
<i>All I love so dearly</i>

01:40:27.313 --> 01:40:31.023
<i>Images passing by</i>

01:40:31.108 --> 01:40:34.522
<i>Like reflections of your mind</i>

01:40:34.612 --> 01:40:37.901
<i>My love, my life</i>

01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:40.983
<i>Are the words I try to find</i>

01:40:41.077 --> 01:40:44.036
<i>My love, my life</i>

01:40:44.121 --> 01:40:48.115
<i>But I know I don't possess you</i>

01:40:48.209 --> 01:40:51.702
<i>With all my heart,
God bless you</i>

01:40:51.796 --> 01:40:57.793
<i>You will be my love
and my life</i>

01:40:58.177 --> 01:41:04.014
<i>You're my one and only</i>

01:41:07.770 --> 01:41:11.605
<i>I held you close to me</i>

01:41:12.942 --> 01:41:18.529
<i>Felt your heartbeat
And I thought I am free</i>

01:41:18.614 --> 01:41:24.702
<i>Oh, yes, and as one are we</i>

01:41:25.788 --> 01:41:32.035
<i>In the now and beyond</i>

01:41:32.128 --> 01:41:34.791
<i>Nothing and no one</i>

01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:39.966
<i>Can break this bond</i>

01:41:42.638 --> 01:41:46.427
<i>Like an image passing by</i>

01:41:46.517 --> 01:41:49.476
<i>My love, my life</i>

01:41:49.562 --> 01:41:52.555
<i>In the mirror of your eyes</i>

01:41:52.648 --> 01:41:55.891
<i>My love, my life</i>

01:41:55.985 --> 01:41:59.774
<i>I can see it all so clearly</i>

01:41:59.864 --> 01:42:04.279
<i>All I love so dearly</i>

01:42:04.785 --> 01:42:08.654
<i>Images passing by</i>

01:42:08.748 --> 01:42:12.332
<i>Like reflections of your mind</i>

01:42:12.418 --> 01:42:15.286
<i>My love, my life</i>

01:42:15.379 --> 01:42:18.463
<i>Are the words I try to find</i>

01:42:18.549 --> 01:42:21.667
<i>My love, my life</i>

01:42:21.761 --> 01:42:25.721
<i>But I know I don't possess you</i>

01:42:25.806 --> 01:42:29.049
<i>With all my heart,
God bless you</i>

01:42:29.143 --> 01:42:34.514
<i>You are still my love
And my life</i>

01:42:34.607 --> 01:42:38.567
<i>Yes, I know
I don't possess you</i>

01:42:38.653 --> 01:42:41.942
<i>With all my heart,
God bless you</i>

01:42:42.031 --> 01:42:47.993
<i>You are still my love
and my life</i>

01:42:48.663 --> 01:42:55.627
<i>You're my one and only</i>

01:43:41.132 --> 01:43:44.296
<i>I was sick
And tired of everything</i>

01:43:44.385 --> 01:43:48.800
<i>When I called you
last night from Glasgow</i>

01:43:48.889 --> 01:43:52.007
<i>All I do is eat
and sleep and sing</i>

01:43:52.101 --> 01:43:56.471
<i>Wishing every show
was the last show</i>

01:43:57.064 --> 01:44:00.808
<i>So imagine I was glad
To hear you're coming</i>

01:44:00.901 --> 01:44:03.393
<i>Suddenly I feel all right</i>

01:44:04.739 --> 01:44:10.952
<i>And it's gonna be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight</i>

01:44:11.454 --> 01:44:15.698
<i>Tonight the Super Trouper
lights are gonna find me</i>

01:44:15.791 --> 01:44:19.284
<i>Shining like the sun</i>

01:44:19.378 --> 01:44:23.418
<i>Smiling, having fun</i>

01:44:23.507 --> 01:44:26.545
<i>Feeling like a number one</i>

01:44:26.635 --> 01:44:31.175
<i>Tonight the Super Trouper
beams are gonna blind me</i>

01:44:31.265 --> 01:44:34.508
<i>But I won't feel blue</i>

01:44:35.019 --> 01:44:38.353
<i>Like I always do</i>

01:44:38.439 --> 01:44:41.728
<i>'Cause somewhere
in the crowd there's you</i>

01:44:56.248 --> 01:44:59.207
<i>Facing twenty-thousand
Of your friends</i>

01:44:59.293 --> 01:45:03.708
<i>How can anyone be so lonely</i>

01:45:03.798 --> 01:45:06.836
<i>Part of a success
that never ends</i>

01:45:06.926 --> 01:45:11.637
<i>Still I'm thinking
about you only</i>

01:45:11.722 --> 01:45:16.092
<i>There are moments
When I think I'm going crazy</i>

01:45:16.185 --> 01:45:18.472
<i>But it's gonna be all right</i>

01:45:18.562 --> 01:45:19.973
<i>You'll soon be
changing everything</i>

01:45:20.064 --> 01:45:26.061
<i>Everything will be so different
when I'm on the stage tonight</i>

01:45:26.153 --> 01:45:30.614
<i>Tonight the Super Trouper
lights are gonna find me</i>

01:45:30.699 --> 01:45:34.318
<i>Shining like the sun</i>

01:45:34.662 --> 01:45:38.201
<i>Smiling, having fun</i>

01:45:38.290 --> 01:45:41.624
<i>Feeling like a number one</i>

01:45:41.710 --> 01:45:46.125
<i>Tonight the Super Trouper
beams are gonna blind me</i>

01:45:46.215 --> 01:45:49.583
<i>But I won't feel blue</i>

01:45:49.677 --> 01:45:53.387
<i>Like I always do</i>

01:45:53.472 --> 01:45:57.842
<i>'Cause somewhere
in the crowd there's you</i>

01:45:59.061 --> 01:46:02.725
<i>So I'll be there
when you arrive</i>

01:46:02.815 --> 01:46:05.808
<i>The sight of you will
prove to me I'm still alive</i>

01:46:05.901 --> 01:46:08.393
<i>And when you
take me in your arms</i>

01:46:08.487 --> 01:46:10.695
<i>And hold me tight</i>

01:46:10.781 --> 01:46:16.072
<i>I know it's gonna
mean so much tonight</i>

01:46:16.161 --> 01:46:20.701
<i>Tonight the Super Trouper
lights are gonna find me</i>

01:46:20.791 --> 01:46:24.205
<i>Shining like the sun</i>

01:46:24.670 --> 01:46:28.129
<i>Smiling, having fun</i>

01:46:28.215 --> 01:46:31.629
<i>Feeling like a number one</i>

01:46:31.719 --> 01:46:35.929
<i>Tonight the Super Trouper
lights are gonna find me</i>

01:46:36.015 --> 01:46:39.725
<i>Shining like the sun</i>

01:46:40.019 --> 01:46:46.812
<i>Smiling, having fun
Feeling like a number one</i>

01:46:46.901 --> 01:46:51.441
<i>Tonight the Super Trouper
beams are gonna blind me</i>

01:46:51.530 --> 01:46:54.398
<i>But I won't feel blue</i>

01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:58.864
<i>Like I always do</i>

01:46:58.954 --> 01:47:02.538
<i>'Cause somewhere in the crowd</i>

01:47:02.666 --> 01:47:08.879
<i>- There's you
- Super Trouper lights are gonna find me</i>

01:52:59.064 --> 01:53:00.521
If she rejects you,
give me a call.

01:53:02.609 --> 01:53:05.773
<i>If you change your mind
I'm the first in line</i>

01:53:06.154 --> 01:53:09.613
<i>Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me</i>

01:53:09.908 --> 01:53:12.025
<i>Gonna do my very best</i>

01:53:13.245 --> 01:53:14.702
Just shout "cut"
whenever you want.
