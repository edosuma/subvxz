[all cheering, laughing]

00:16.349 --> 00:20.020
[cheering, laughing continue]

00:20.103 --> 00:21.187
Cheers!

00:21.896 --> 00:24.649
-[Noah] Yeah, that's what I'm saying!
-[cheering continues]

00:24.733 --> 00:26.276
Whoo!

00:27.402 --> 00:29.612
-[Noah] Good?
-[Talvinder] Yeah, great.

00:33.658 --> 00:36.119
[all cheering]

00:36.703 --> 00:40.540
Guys, guys. Guess what I just found?

00:40.623 --> 00:41.541
-What?
-What?

00:41.624 --> 00:43.001
A swimming hole.

00:43.084 --> 00:44.544
[all cheering]

00:44.627 --> 00:46.921
-[Talvinder] You guys wanna go swimming?
-[Dawn] I wanna go swimming.

00:47.005 --> 00:48.089
I can barely walk!

00:48.173 --> 00:51.968
-Oh, come on. Oh!
-I'm good! I'm good!

00:52.051 --> 00:54.888
-Come on. We've got your back.
-Yeah, it'll be fun.

00:54.971 --> 00:57.057
-It'll be great.
-[laughing] Okay.

01:00.351 --> 01:01.811
[Talvinder] You guys,
did anyone bring a towel?

01:01.895 --> 01:03.730
Do you want me to go back
and get a picnic blanket?

01:03.813 --> 01:05.732
[Andi] No, we're fine. Come on.

01:06.441 --> 01:10.820
[laughs] You guys, what is this?
There's a fire?

01:11.404 --> 01:15.075
-[Andi] We're here.
-[Talvinder] Here? This is weird.

01:17.243 --> 01:18.745
What's going on, you guys?

01:21.414 --> 01:22.916
Guys, this is freaking me out.

01:24.959 --> 01:26.461
Tell me or I'm going back.

01:26.544 --> 01:28.922
-What the fuck?
-You're on trial, Talvinder.

01:29.547 --> 01:32.759
-For what?
-For being a nasty bitch.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.553
Get in the circle.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.096
[scoffs] Fuck that.

01:37.722 --> 01:39.557
[Andi] Get in the fucking circle.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.730
[Andi] I felt sorry for you.

01:46.481 --> 01:51.069
I opened myself up to you,
I let you into my world,

01:51.152 --> 01:54.364
and you used that
to go and fuck my boyfriend.

01:56.116 --> 02:00.036
I used to trust people,
but I can't do that anymore.

02:00.620 --> 02:01.788
And that's because of you.

02:01.871 --> 02:04.374
-None of that was Peter's fault?
-Shut the fuck up!

02:04.457 --> 02:06.543
-No, you don't get to talk!
-Peter fucked me, Andi.

02:06.626 --> 02:08.378
I didn't make him. He wanted to.

02:09.921 --> 02:11.965
So, stop acting like the fucking victim!

02:13.633 --> 02:14.592
Next?

02:15.260 --> 02:16.886
I never liked you.

02:19.013 --> 02:22.725
I never trusted you
from the minute I met you.

02:25.103 --> 02:27.814
And it's not
because you're a terrible person.

02:29.232 --> 02:30.775
It's because you're nothing.

02:34.654 --> 02:36.030
Who are you, Talvinder?

02:37.448 --> 02:38.867
Can you even answer that?

02:41.452 --> 02:43.580
I should've seen what Susan saw.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.249
In the real world...

02:47.417 --> 02:49.627
I wouldn't give you the time of day,
not for a second.

02:51.546 --> 02:52.964
We wouldn't even be friends.

02:56.217 --> 02:57.302
I'm sorry.

02:59.637 --> 03:00.471
[scoffs]

03:01.014 --> 03:02.140
Fuck you.

03:05.602 --> 03:09.689
I was supposed to stand up here and talk
about how awful of a person you are.

03:10.857 --> 03:15.486
But if anyone should be on trial, it's me,
'cause what I did was way worse.

03:17.405 --> 03:18.948
I'm so sorry, Andi.

03:20.909 --> 03:21.910
I really am.

03:31.294 --> 03:32.629
That's all I've got to say.

03:42.138 --> 03:43.556
All right, Noah, buddy.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.018
It's your turn.

03:51.272 --> 03:54.234
-Shut up!
-[Talvinder screaming]

03:54.317 --> 03:56.152
Shut the fuck up!

03:56.236 --> 03:59.322
Shut up! I'm gonna teach you
some fucking manners!

03:59.405 --> 04:02.617
[screaming continues]

04:02.700 --> 04:04.035
[Talvinder] Stop!

04:04.118 --> 04:06.371
[screaming] No!

04:06.454 --> 04:07.914
[whimpering]

04:07.997 --> 04:09.290
[Peter] Talvinder!

04:10.041 --> 04:11.167
-[Susan] Talvinder!
-[Peter] Talvinder!

04:11.251 --> 04:12.961
[Andi] Wait, just come back!
We'll take you!

04:13.044 --> 04:14.212
[Susan] It's not safe!

04:14.295 --> 04:18.633
[whimpering]

04:23.846 --> 04:24.847
[Peter] Talvinder!

04:29.102 --> 04:31.062
-[Peter] No, no, no, no!
-[Andi] Oh, my God.

04:56.170 --> 04:57.463
She... She's dead.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.924
-[Susan] What?
-[Peter] She's dead!

05:01.050 --> 05:04.637
No, no, no, no. Oh, fuck.

05:09.767 --> 05:10.768
[screaming]

05:10.852 --> 05:12.645
If we take her back, we're going to jail!

05:12.729 --> 05:15.231
-It's her word against ours.
-No, I can't. No, I can't--

05:15.315 --> 05:16.232
Susan!

05:17.650 --> 05:19.444
[screaming]

05:26.909 --> 05:28.286
-[Talvinder screams]
-[all gasp]

05:42.300 --> 05:44.260
Dawn. Dawn!

05:44.343 --> 05:45.344
No!

05:46.220 --> 05:47.221
Stop!

05:52.477 --> 05:54.020
[groaning]

06:06.741 --> 06:08.076
Noah.

06:09.452 --> 06:10.453
Noah!

06:13.289 --> 06:14.499
[Talvinder coughs]

06:40.691 --> 06:43.653
Wren, wait! What's gonna happen now?

06:43.736 --> 06:46.197
What, you're gonna go into that house
with a gun and--?

06:46.280 --> 06:47.698
They're murderers, Judith!

06:49.408 --> 06:52.995
Keira's a murderer?
Or Mark? Who did he kill?

06:53.704 --> 06:57.708
What about Renée or Antoine or the woman
who came to us to find shelter?

06:57.792 --> 07:00.419
-What about Gene? What about them?
-They got in the way!

07:01.462 --> 07:02.630
Talvinder was 20.

07:04.549 --> 07:06.467
Judith, she was 20. She was a child.

07:06.551 --> 07:09.011
Those five, they took her out
into the woods and they caved her head in.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.305
And then they left her there to rot.

07:12.849 --> 07:16.060
They were her friends and they killed her.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.646
And they let an innocent man
take the fall for what they did.

07:23.484 --> 07:26.237
-The others--
-The others? The others don't matter.

07:29.782 --> 07:30.616
Keira lives.

07:31.826 --> 07:32.827
Give me the gun.

07:33.369 --> 07:34.745
What about the rest of 'em?

07:39.167 --> 07:40.168
They're all yours.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.601
[Judith]  I was out walking, and I...

07:58.394 --> 07:59.562
I heard something.

08:00.980 --> 08:04.942
I thought it was Peter, but it wasn't.
It was Mark.

08:06.402 --> 08:08.654
And he had
this really weird look on his face,

08:08.738 --> 08:11.073
and I thought
it was because I upset him,

08:11.157 --> 08:14.410
because I left to go find Peter,
and then...

08:15.286 --> 08:17.955
We started walking,
and then I saw your gun.

08:19.790 --> 08:20.958
And...

08:22.543 --> 08:23.544
I realized...

08:25.338 --> 08:27.089
that he was going to, um...

08:28.007 --> 08:30.176
He was taking me into the woods
to shoot me.

08:30.968 --> 08:32.595
No, Mark would never do that.

08:35.681 --> 08:36.974
Mark is gonna shoot me,

08:37.058 --> 08:39.852
and I don't even know how it happens,
but I think it's my...

08:41.312 --> 08:42.897
it's my only chance.

08:43.648 --> 08:47.026
And so I reach for the gun,
and I'm saying,

08:47.109 --> 08:51.739
"Mark, stop this. Don't come any closer."

08:53.866 --> 08:57.453
And he kept coming,
and he was threatening me, and I...

09:03.709 --> 09:04.585
I pulled the trigger.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.305
That's okay, Judith.
You don't need to say any more.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.640
We all understand.

09:17.723 --> 09:21.894
I don't know.
No, this doesn't make any fucking sense.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.397
-Dawn.
-This doesn't make any fucking sense.

09:25.439 --> 09:26.482
You're lying.

09:27.316 --> 09:29.569
-This is bullshit.
-You need to calm-- You need to calm down.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.279
-You're the killer, aren't you, Judith?
-Dawn.

09:31.362 --> 09:34.699
Aren't you? And you're saying all of this
so that we'll just lower our guard.

09:34.782 --> 09:38.035
But I'm not gonna sit here,
waiting to be your next victim.

09:38.619 --> 09:39.912
I will protect myself.

09:43.165 --> 09:44.375
Oh, my God.

09:45.668 --> 09:46.669
Take it.

09:48.045 --> 09:49.547
Please, I don't-- I don't want it.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.134
Take it.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.570
She was still in shock when I found her.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.197
Still had the gun in her hand.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.992
I'm really having a hard time
imagining Judith shooting anybody.

10:18.075 --> 10:19.076
It was self-defense.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.870
Well, I'm having a hard time
picturing Mark

10:20.953 --> 10:23.456
-being a cold-blooded serial killer.
-Are you serious?

10:23.539 --> 10:25.916
-Yes!
-I nearly froze to death because of him.

10:27.001 --> 10:28.711
He drugged me and locked me
out of the fucking house.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.838
Yes, because he thought
you were the killer. Do you get it?

10:30.921 --> 10:31.964
-[Peter] Did he?
-[Dawn] Yes.

10:32.048 --> 10:34.800
Or maybe he was just saying that
because he wanted to take me out!

10:35.384 --> 10:36.844
Maybe if you just open your eyes and see--

10:36.927 --> 10:39.180
I am, Peter! I am and I'm not buying it!

10:39.263 --> 10:42.058
Could you please just listen to me
for one second without reacting?

10:42.141 --> 10:44.352
-If Judith is the one killing us...
-[Peter] Oh, my God.

10:44.435 --> 10:46.520
...she's gonna be smart about it!
It's not impossible!

10:46.604 --> 10:47.605
[Wren] Yeah, it is. Judith?

10:48.439 --> 10:52.777
Judith tearing out people's eyeballs,
fuckin' pureeing Renée with a snowmobile?

10:53.694 --> 10:54.779
[Peter] Keira, what do you think?

10:56.656 --> 10:59.742
Well, Judith had a nervous breakdown
before she got here.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.744
-Hm.
-Mark...

11:01.827 --> 11:03.913
He saw a woman die right in front of him.

11:04.497 --> 11:08.125
And obviously, he's been overwhelmed
the past few days.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.295
-He probably has PTSD.
-Yes, because he was shot!

11:11.379 --> 11:13.089
He was shot and that changed his life!

11:13.172 --> 11:16.425
-Maybe it fucked with his head, Dawn!
-[Keira] Look, Judith gave us the gun.

11:17.176 --> 11:20.179
We didn't ask for it.
She just handed it over.

11:20.262 --> 11:22.098
If she was the killer,
why would she do that?

11:27.311 --> 11:28.312
[Noah] You awake, Peter?

11:30.106 --> 11:31.107
Yes.

11:32.149 --> 11:33.401
Last night...

11:37.863 --> 11:39.115
Did that...

11:41.575 --> 11:42.618
Did it really happen?

11:44.662 --> 11:46.080
I mean, like...

11:46.163 --> 11:49.625
like, maybe we were all just...
asleep, you know?

11:50.876 --> 11:53.754
Or I guess-- I guess I am, but, I mean,
then maybe I'm trapped in a nightmare--

11:53.838 --> 11:55.798
-Noah, shut the fuck up!
-[knocking on door]

11:58.342 --> 11:59.176
Who is it?

11:59.260 --> 12:00.261
Who do you think?

12:02.096 --> 12:04.473
-People keep asking us where Talvinder is.
-What'd you tell them?

12:04.557 --> 12:06.934
That she went out for a jog earlier
this morning. We haven't seen her since.

12:07.017 --> 12:08.978
-Do they believe you?
-So far.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.771
There was-- There was
that bear sighting last week, right?

12:10.855 --> 12:12.356
On the trail, past the lake?

12:12.440 --> 12:14.984
Maybe-- Maybe we remind people about that.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.361
Talvinder was eaten by a bear.
That's what you wanna tell people?

12:17.445 --> 12:20.239
At least, I'm coming up with something.
We have to say something, Peter.

12:20.322 --> 12:21.824
-No. No, we don't.
-Yes, we do.

12:21.907 --> 12:24.034
Look, she went for a run.
That's the last time you saw her.

12:24.118 --> 12:25.411
She's not coming back
from that fucking run!

12:25.494 --> 12:26.996
-Dawn! Shh!
-[Dawn] They'll call the police.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.582
And if anyone saw us with her yesterday,
it's all gonna come back to us,

12:29.665 --> 12:31.625
and then we're going to jail
for the rest of our fucking lives.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.836
-Just calm down. Calm-- Calm--
-Shh!

12:33.919 --> 12:35.171
Please don't fucking tell me
to relax right now!

12:35.254 --> 12:38.340
You need to fucking calm down.
Dawn, calm down right now!

12:39.383 --> 12:41.177
-Breathe.
-We need-- But we need to do something.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.136
-Yes.
-Right?

12:42.219 --> 12:43.220
Just breathe.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.978
This is my life now.

12:51.061 --> 12:53.939
Yes, Andi, this is your life now.

12:55.816 --> 12:56.817
This is my life.

13:01.447 --> 13:02.531
All of our fuckin' lives.

13:06.368 --> 13:08.996
[Dawn] I can't fucking believe
that we are taking her word for it

13:09.079 --> 13:10.206
for something that none of us saw.

13:10.289 --> 13:12.833
[Keira] Dawn, she could've come in here
and shot all of us, but she didn't.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.585
She did the exact opposite.

13:14.668 --> 13:18.088
[engine revving]

13:34.230 --> 13:35.814
Where the hell is my boyfriend?

13:47.117 --> 13:51.956
[Peter] Janice, just stay here, okay?
Gene is... I don't even know what to say.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.376
Oh, my God.

13:58.629 --> 14:00.881
[Peter] Let's get back to the main house.

14:06.303 --> 14:08.180
-Stay away from me!
-Look, I know you're in shock.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.849
I told Gene you guys are a cult!

14:10.933 --> 14:13.477
J-Janice, listen, we need your help.

14:16.021 --> 14:17.356
You can get us out of here.

14:23.195 --> 14:24.697
I've got room for one.

14:24.780 --> 14:27.032
What if we siphon some of the gas
from your sled into one of ours?

14:27.616 --> 14:29.034
I said I've got room for one!

14:29.618 --> 14:32.204
-It should be Keira who goes.
-We need to get help.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.914
Keira could call the police
from your place.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.916
Why me? Why do I get to go?

14:37.751 --> 14:38.627
Because...

14:40.254 --> 14:43.841
you have your whole life ahead of you,
and the sooner you get out of here...

14:45.009 --> 14:47.845
-safe and sound--
-I thought we were safe and sound.

14:47.928 --> 14:49.263
Now that Mark's dead?

14:51.348 --> 14:55.811
Dawn should go. You're injured.
You need real medical attention.

14:56.604 --> 14:59.523
You're a part of this community.
This is our home.

15:00.190 --> 15:02.610
Dawn goes. End of discussion.

15:27.301 --> 15:30.846
Well, take care of yourself...
and stay inside that house.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.640
Don't come out until the police get here.

15:33.682 --> 15:34.767
Okay.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.560
Promise me, Peter.

15:37.728 --> 15:38.562
I promise.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.648
[engine starts]

15:46.195 --> 15:47.738
You gave them the gun?

15:50.366 --> 15:51.367
I had to.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.870
It was either that or...

16:06.423 --> 16:08.217
I will see you again.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.762
[crying]

16:42.876 --> 16:45.295
-[rumbling, clattering]
-[both gasp]

16:46.088 --> 16:48.048
It just was snow falling off the roof.

16:48.716 --> 16:51.427
Well, I can't just sit here.
I need to do something.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.846
Why don't you go upstairs
and pack your things?

16:54.430 --> 16:56.265
They'll probably let us
bring a bag or two,

16:56.348 --> 16:58.350
if you wanna go get your things ready.

17:05.649 --> 17:07.568
[to herself] This-- This is for the best.

17:08.360 --> 17:11.405
This is for the best.
This is for the best.

17:16.827 --> 17:17.828
Mark's the killer.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.415
Peter and Keira believe that.

17:23.125 --> 17:24.001
And...

17:26.462 --> 17:28.172
And the police will too.

17:29.590 --> 17:32.134
And then you and me,
we can leave this place, Wren.

17:33.844 --> 17:35.971
We can leave the awful memories, and...

17:37.848 --> 17:39.141
and we can live in peace.

17:41.226 --> 17:42.561
They've paid.

17:42.644 --> 17:45.606
They've paid.
Even if they live, they've paid.

17:48.650 --> 17:49.651
Open your heart.

17:51.445 --> 17:52.780
Open your heart.

17:55.407 --> 17:56.825
I'm gonna go find Dawn.

17:59.453 --> 18:00.454
I'm gonna kill her.

18:02.831 --> 18:05.334
Then I'll come back here,
and I'm gonna kill him too.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.628
No, no, no, no, no, no.

18:07.711 --> 18:09.963
-And if Keira gets in the way...
-No.

18:10.672 --> 18:13.425
-No, no, no, no. You promised.
-You don't love me.

18:13.509 --> 18:16.053
Wren, please, I do. You know I do.

18:16.136 --> 18:17.137
No.

18:19.389 --> 18:20.641
No, you just love yourself.

18:42.412 --> 18:44.331
So, what happens when you get back?

18:50.003 --> 18:51.130
I miss being a nurse.

18:54.466 --> 18:55.467
You're a healer.

18:57.469 --> 18:59.513
-No.
-Yes, you are.

19:01.515 --> 19:04.643
-Hey. Hey.
-[sighs]

19:04.726 --> 19:06.019
You kept Noah alive.

19:08.897 --> 19:10.065
I killed someone.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.444
-That was an accident, Keira.
-No.

19:15.904 --> 19:17.406
An accident is an act of God.

19:18.073 --> 19:20.242
It's something you can't control.

19:20.325 --> 19:23.412
I screwed up... and somebody died.

19:27.624 --> 19:29.334
Well, now, you get to make things right.

19:32.296 --> 19:33.380
You get to go back...

19:35.215 --> 19:36.258
and save lives.

19:38.594 --> 19:39.428
What about you?

19:48.854 --> 19:51.190
I'll do what I should have done
five years ago.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.235
-You'll go to jail.
-I will.

19:56.528 --> 19:57.696
And so will Dawn.

20:01.408 --> 20:02.868
Keira, my friends and I...

20:04.536 --> 20:06.622
we deserved everything
that happened to us.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.624
-Peter.
-No, justice...

20:11.335 --> 20:12.336
is justice.

20:18.258 --> 20:21.637
I thought I'd finally found someone...
who really understood me.

20:23.430 --> 20:25.390
Someone who really loved me for who I am.

20:26.225 --> 20:29.102
-I do. I do love you.
-No, you don't.

20:30.604 --> 20:33.357
You say you do, but you don't.
You're just pretending.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.485
What am I? What do I mean to you?

20:37.611 --> 20:38.445
Everything.

20:38.528 --> 20:39.988
-Everything?
-Everything.

20:44.910 --> 20:45.911
Will you help me?

20:48.330 --> 20:50.540
Will you kill them for me? Please?

20:51.124 --> 20:53.752
-Please?
-No, no, it's too late. It's too late.

20:53.835 --> 20:56.088
Dawn... Dawn's miles and miles away now.

20:56.171 --> 20:57.547
It's too late.

21:01.885 --> 21:02.886
Then I'll do it myself.

21:04.513 --> 21:08.225
-If I leave now, I can catch 'em.
-No! Peter and Keira will hear you.

21:08.308 --> 21:10.269
-And then they'll put two and two--
-Then I'll shoot them both.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.979
No, no. No Keira. You said--

21:12.062 --> 21:13.063
Goddamn it!

21:13.146 --> 21:16.692
That's enough about fucking Keira!
Fucking Keira!

21:16.775 --> 21:19.528
-Keira is innocent! You can't kill Keira!
-Keira's not!

21:20.445 --> 21:21.905
You fucking bitch!

21:21.989 --> 21:23.156
You fucking bitch!

21:23.240 --> 21:25.409
You care more about her
than you do about me!

21:26.493 --> 21:27.494
No!

21:30.539 --> 21:31.373
Wren, don't!

21:31.957 --> 21:34.584
No one will ever love you
like I fucking loved you!

21:34.668 --> 21:36.795
You're gonna die alone
because you're weak!

21:36.878 --> 21:40.382
You fucking coward!
You fucking worthless coward!

21:40.465 --> 21:42.467
Because you're fucking weak!

21:42.551 --> 21:43.635
-Wren, no!
-Shit!

21:44.344 --> 21:46.638
You never deserved me.
You never did and you never will.

21:46.722 --> 21:49.182
-No! No!
-You're fucking weak! You're fucking weak!

21:49.266 --> 21:53.562
-You're fucking weak!
-You won't take over! No! [panting]

21:53.645 --> 21:54.604
[gasps]

22:05.198 --> 22:09.619
[grunting, panting]

22:17.044 --> 22:18.837
-[clattering]
-Judith!

22:18.920 --> 22:22.674
-[glass shattering]
-[knocks] Judith, are you okay? Judith!

22:37.898 --> 22:39.649
Judith's always been fragile.

22:40.692 --> 22:43.320
She's really kept it together
the last couple days...

22:43.904 --> 22:44.905
until she killed Mark.

22:47.240 --> 22:48.325
Is she gonna be okay?

22:49.743 --> 22:52.329
-I think so. They're just scratches.
-I don't mean physically.

22:54.247 --> 22:56.208
-We need to find Mark's body.
-Yeah.

22:56.291 --> 22:58.085
We need to confirm
that he's actually dead.

22:58.168 --> 23:01.088
-I'm pretty sure he's dead, Keira.
-Well, pretty sure isn't good enough.

23:02.380 --> 23:04.591
You're right. You know what?
You stay here. I'm gonna go find him.

23:04.674 --> 23:06.927
-No, I'm coming with you.
-No, you're gonna stay here.

23:07.010 --> 23:08.470
Peter, you can't go out there by yourself.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.263
Look, we can't leave Judith here alone.

23:10.931 --> 23:14.309
When help arrives, someone needs
to be here and they need to be awake.

23:15.769 --> 23:18.271
-You know what? You take this.
-No.

23:18.355 --> 23:19.356
Take it.

23:19.981 --> 23:23.110
I cannot be out there worried
about you and myself. Take the gun.

23:26.655 --> 23:29.032
You need to come back here
as soon as you can.

23:33.745 --> 23:34.746
Okay, I promise.

23:35.539 --> 23:36.873
Don't make promises you can't keep.

23:45.215 --> 23:46.299
I'm keeping this one.

23:48.927 --> 23:50.011
Lock the door behind me.

24:02.107 --> 24:03.066
[lock clicks]

24:06.486 --> 24:07.487
Judith.

24:09.197 --> 24:10.490
Did I fall asleep?

24:10.574 --> 24:12.826
[sighs] No, you passed out.

24:14.744 --> 24:15.620
You don't remember?

24:17.789 --> 24:18.623
It's okay.

24:18.707 --> 24:19.708
Look...

24:20.500 --> 24:25.005
I know. It's all just been...
way too much for you.

24:25.088 --> 24:26.089
You're overwhelmed.

24:27.716 --> 24:29.885
It's okay. They're coming to get us.

24:30.719 --> 24:31.720
Did I, uh...

24:32.762 --> 24:33.763
Did I hurt anyone?

24:34.806 --> 24:35.682
No.

24:36.850 --> 24:37.851
Just yourself.

24:42.480 --> 24:43.481
Where's Peter going?

24:47.611 --> 24:49.404
-Um...
-What?

24:50.989 --> 24:52.282
He's going to get Mark's body.

24:53.867 --> 24:56.203
But don't let that upset you, okay?

24:59.164 --> 25:00.832
I'm gonna go clean up my mess.

25:01.416 --> 25:04.044
-Judith, you should rest.
-I'm gonna go to my room.

25:12.385 --> 25:13.762
What's left of my room.

25:33.698 --> 25:34.699
Wren?

25:37.577 --> 25:38.578
Wren?

25:41.414 --> 25:42.415
Wren?

25:43.458 --> 25:44.459
Where are you?

25:47.254 --> 25:48.255
Wren?

25:51.132 --> 25:52.550
Please come out, Wren.

25:52.634 --> 25:53.718
[Wren's voice]  I will...

25:53.802 --> 25:55.053
[suspenseful music playing]

25:55.136 --> 25:56.805
...if you kill them for me.

25:57.806 --> 25:59.975
-No.
-Kill 'em.

26:00.058 --> 26:03.979
No! No, I can't do that, Wren. I can't.

26:04.062 --> 26:07.232
-Do it.
-No, I don't want to.

26:07.315 --> 26:09.567
-Don't make me do this.
-Judith.

26:09.651 --> 26:11.069
-No.
-Judith, do it.

26:11.152 --> 26:14.698
-No. No, no. No, no, no.
-I said do it. Judith, I said do it!

26:14.781 --> 26:18.243
Stop being a fucking coward
and go out there and kill them for me!

26:18.326 --> 26:20.912
-[breathing heavily]
-Do it now!

26:20.996 --> 26:22.956
[groans]

26:23.039 --> 26:24.040
Judith.

26:26.251 --> 26:29.170
Judith, if you don't kill them... I will.

27:13.631 --> 27:16.051
[door opens, closes]

28:08.561 --> 28:11.648
-What are you doing? Why are we stopping?
-A week ago, this was all ice.

28:11.731 --> 28:14.401
Okay, can we just...
can we ride through it or...?

28:14.484 --> 28:15.485
Are you kidding me?

28:18.029 --> 28:19.864
We'll have to backtrack to the main trail.

28:19.948 --> 28:22.534
There's a bridge that way.
I think we have enough fuel.

28:23.159 --> 28:25.412
Oh, you think? Okay, great.

30:39.420 --> 30:40.797
Get us the fuck out of here now.

30:43.007 --> 30:45.635
[screams] Janice! Janice! Janice, Janice!

30:48.012 --> 30:49.097
Janice! Janice!

30:51.307 --> 30:52.934
[whimpering]

30:53.768 --> 30:55.770
[cries, gasps]

32:05.048 --> 32:06.049
Keira!

32:06.633 --> 32:08.426
Hey, hey, hey!

32:08.509 --> 32:09.510
Hey!

32:14.933 --> 32:16.142
Judith!

32:17.894 --> 32:19.020
Judith, where are you?

32:35.161 --> 32:36.371
Come on. Come on.

32:36.454 --> 32:38.665
Stay with me. Keira. Keira!

32:42.085 --> 32:43.544
Come on, come on.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.043
[Owen's voice]  Dear Mom...

33:25.878 --> 33:30.425
The evidence against me...
is overwhelming.

33:32.093 --> 33:33.594
I'm not getting out of here.

33:35.388 --> 33:36.431
Not alive anyway.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.393
Those five...

33:42.395 --> 33:43.521
...framed me.

33:44.480 --> 33:46.107
Please, Mother, find justice.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.359
Do whatever it takes.

33:49.402 --> 33:50.486
Destroy them.

33:59.328 --> 34:00.663
Love, your little wren...

34:01.706 --> 34:03.041
Owen.

34:13.384 --> 34:14.427
Come on, come on.

34:19.182 --> 34:20.349
Please don't take her from me.

34:24.187 --> 34:25.021
[Judith] Peter.

34:43.039 --> 34:46.584
-She's alive.
-Barely.

34:47.835 --> 34:48.753
Peter...

34:49.921 --> 34:51.214
You have a choice to make.

34:52.882 --> 34:54.050
One of you lives...

34:56.135 --> 34:57.845
one of you dies.

34:58.429 --> 35:00.306
No, no, no, no, no. Fuck that.

35:00.973 --> 35:01.974
No?

35:04.102 --> 35:05.103
No.

35:05.895 --> 35:06.896
Why not?

35:08.981 --> 35:10.358
You've done it before.

35:19.242 --> 35:20.993
[Peter] No, no, no.

35:27.917 --> 35:30.086
"The Assyrian came down
like the wolf on the fold.

35:30.586 --> 35:33.297
And his cohorts were gleaming
in purple and gold.

35:33.381 --> 35:36.467
And the sheen of their spears
was like stars on the sea...

35:37.426 --> 35:40.179
when the blue wave rolls nightly
on deep Galilee.

35:40.263 --> 35:44.183
But the Angel of Death
spread his wings on the blast

35:44.851 --> 35:47.603
and breathed
on the face of the foes he passed.

35:47.687 --> 35:51.149
And the eyes of the sleepers
waxed deadly and chill.

35:51.232 --> 35:54.777
And their hearts but once heaved
and forever grew still.

35:55.903 --> 35:57.363
And forever grew still."

36:28.561 --> 36:30.521
How do I know you just won't kill her?

36:31.230 --> 36:32.732
Because I don't want to.

36:32.815 --> 36:35.526
And Antoine? Did you want to kill him?

36:37.153 --> 36:38.237
Or Renée?

36:40.698 --> 36:41.574
Or Gene?

36:44.452 --> 36:47.288
[Peter]  What about the others, huh?
Why did you kill them?

36:47.371 --> 36:49.540
Why the fuck did you kill them?

36:50.833 --> 36:52.293
Enough!

36:54.378 --> 36:55.880
Those deaths are on you!

36:56.714 --> 36:58.466
You and your fuckin' friends!

36:59.508 --> 37:01.427
You killed Talvinder.

37:01.510 --> 37:03.137
You framed me.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.097
You sent me to jail.

37:05.181 --> 37:07.516
You killed me!

37:09.227 --> 37:13.147
-Judith, wait.
-Stop calling me that.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.482
You're not Owen.

37:15.149 --> 37:16.734
No, no, no, no, Owen's dead.

37:17.944 --> 37:19.320
You're Judith.

37:20.112 --> 37:21.405
Did you get my letter?

37:22.406 --> 37:23.324
Yes, I did.

37:28.746 --> 37:29.997
[radio feedback]

37:37.922 --> 37:39.840
No! No! No!

37:45.680 --> 37:46.681
Peter...

37:47.723 --> 37:50.393
-what is...?
-Okay, okay. Judith, Judith.

37:50.476 --> 37:51.811
-Judith, listen to me.
-Where am I?

37:51.894 --> 37:53.354
Please give me the gun.

37:53.437 --> 37:56.816
Please, okay? We're-We're in danger, okay?
Give me the gun.

37:56.899 --> 37:57.858
No!

37:58.651 --> 38:00.945
Shoot that... [grunts]

38:01.028 --> 38:03.239
Wren! Wren, you stop! Enough!

38:03.322 --> 38:06.909
Shoot! Shoot that fucker between the eyes!

38:06.993 --> 38:07.952
Don't make me!

38:08.869 --> 38:10.288
Five minutes!

38:12.123 --> 38:13.124
That's...

38:13.791 --> 38:14.792
That's all it took.

38:15.876 --> 38:17.795
It was five minutes.

38:18.379 --> 38:22.008
From the moment Owen hung himself...

38:22.091 --> 38:25.386
until they found him
hanging by his bedsheets.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.682
-You...
-I'm sorry.

38:31.267 --> 38:32.393
I'm so sorry.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.439
If I-- If I could--
If I could go back, I would.

38:36.522 --> 38:38.691
You owe me those five minutes.

38:40.693 --> 38:41.777
You owe me.

38:42.737 --> 38:44.155
You wanted to do right?

38:45.573 --> 38:48.075
Now's your chance. Huh?

38:48.159 --> 38:53.039
I'll put a bullet in Keira's brain
and make the decision for you.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.375
And you can just walk away.

38:56.459 --> 38:57.626
You walk away...

38:59.253 --> 39:01.172
and go back to living your life...

39:04.008 --> 39:05.718
or Keira does.

39:07.219 --> 39:08.471
It's up to you, Peter.

39:17.104 --> 39:20.358
-[Dawn] Noah.
-[Noah grunting, panting]

39:24.779 --> 39:28.657
[both crying]

39:28.741 --> 39:31.118
-[gasps]
-[gasps]

39:31.911 --> 39:33.537
[Noah] Why won't you fuckin' die?

39:35.039 --> 39:36.457
Why won't you die?

39:37.208 --> 39:39.794
-[crying]
-Just fuckin' die!

40:34.807 --> 40:38.018
[heart beating rapidly]

41:58.182 --> 41:59.016
Jay?

42:00.518 --> 42:01.519
Jay, you okay?

42:04.063 --> 42:05.981
What's going on, buddy? What you got?

43:40.200 --> 43:41.785
[Peter's voice]  Dear Mr. and Mrs. Gill...

43:43.329 --> 43:46.540
I'm writing this letter to tell you
that your daughter Talvinder is dead.

43:47.958 --> 43:49.668
She's been dead these past five years,

43:50.419 --> 43:53.881
since the night me
and my friends killed her

43:53.964 --> 43:56.634
and then buried her body
in the woods near our summer camp.

43:59.470 --> 44:01.680
My friends and I did
a terrible thing that night...

44:02.640 --> 44:04.683
and then we did another terrible thing
a few days later.

44:06.143 --> 44:08.228
We framed Owen Turnbull for the crime,

44:08.812 --> 44:09.813
and he hung himself...

44:11.357 --> 44:12.358
because of us.

44:16.236 --> 44:18.238
Two deaths, and we are to blame.

44:20.115 --> 44:21.116
We are murderers.

44:22.534 --> 44:25.037
We've told ourselves
it was just an accident, but it wasn't.

44:26.205 --> 44:27.414
We didn't set out to kill her,

44:27.498 --> 44:30.042
but the actions we took that night
cost Talvinder her life.

44:31.126 --> 44:33.545
It's time my friends and I paid
for what we did.

44:34.546 --> 44:37.883
It's time Talvinder and Owen
get the justice they deserve.

44:39.426 --> 44:42.471
It's time for me to step up
and do what needs to be done.

44:43.764 --> 44:44.765
Sincerely...

44:46.058 --> 44:47.059
Peter Burrow.

44:51.939 --> 44:54.274
[sirens wailing in distance]

45:17.131 --> 45:18.132
Hey.

45:22.803 --> 45:24.263
Um, thank you for coming.

45:27.099 --> 45:29.309
I would hug you, but...

45:47.161 --> 45:48.787
You're doing the right thing.

45:51.665 --> 45:52.499
Uh...

45:55.252 --> 45:57.838
Talvinder's parents
deserve to know the truth.

46:01.633 --> 46:04.928
I just keep thinking about Mark,
and Peter and...

46:07.806 --> 46:09.641
how they died 'cause of me.

46:10.601 --> 46:11.602
No.

46:12.728 --> 46:14.062
They died because of Judith.

46:16.273 --> 46:18.108
Our friends were killed because of Judith.

46:19.276 --> 46:20.277
Right.

46:22.946 --> 46:24.281
You ready?

46:26.575 --> 46:27.493
Okay.

46:29.745 --> 46:30.579
Yeah.

47:09.701 --> 47:11.036
You came back to me.

47:12.246 --> 47:13.247
Of course I did.

47:15.165 --> 47:16.500
I'll never leave you again.

47:20.420 --> 47:23.674
Now, what do we do... about Dawn?

47:25.175 --> 47:26.385
She's getting away.

47:28.762 --> 47:29.888
For now.

47:32.558 --> 47:34.059
But when she gets out...

47:35.310 --> 47:36.478
we'll be waiting.

47:53.704 --> 47:57.666
