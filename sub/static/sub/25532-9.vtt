WEBVTT

00:59.810 --> 01:01.979
Why... look at that.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.612
- My heavens!
- My heavens!

01:11.822 --> 01:15.951
- What was that?
- Who was that?! She was wearing pants!

01:16.034 --> 01:18.370
- What do you mean, pants?
- Pants!

01:24.293 --> 01:26.169
Oh. No, no, no, no, no.

01:33.677 --> 01:35.095
Pedaling it is.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.724
Oh! Come on!

01:39.308 --> 01:40.225
Argh!

01:40.309 --> 01:42.102
Of all days.

01:42.185 --> 01:44.521
Oh, I can't believe this.

01:50.027 --> 01:51.236
Argh!

02:03.707 --> 02:05.542
I'm so sorry I'm late.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.502
Hello. I'm Muriel.

02:07.586 --> 02:09.253
Muriel Stacy.

02:09.338 --> 02:12.549
Good day, Miss Stacy.
I'm Mrs. Harmon Andrews. Welcome.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.718
I'm afraid I lost track of the time.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.678
I was decorating my new home...

02:16.762 --> 02:19.306
you can use potatoes for so many things,
it boggles the mind,

02:19.389 --> 02:22.559
it really does...
and then my tardiness was compounded

02:22.643 --> 02:24.603
when my motorbike broke down
on the way. And...

02:24.686 --> 02:27.731
please forgive my appearance

02:27.814 --> 02:29.733
and my hopefully excusable delay.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.235
Let's hope that's all we have to forgive.

03:17.072 --> 03:18.949
And Mother was talking to Mrs. Pye

03:19.032 --> 03:22.619
and she said the PMSC felt
that Miss Stacy is probably unsuitable.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.622
But she rides a motorbike!

03:25.831 --> 03:28.625
Miss Stacy seems modern and thrilling!

03:28.708 --> 03:30.377
I heard she's a spinster.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.546
I heard she's from the mainland.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.841
Why would an unmarried woman
from the big city come here?

03:36.049 --> 03:38.051
There's a scandal somewhere, you'll see.

03:38.844 --> 03:41.847
- Mother hated Miss Stacy on sight.
- So did mine.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.975
show up an hour late...

03:45.058 --> 03:46.351
Dressed like a man...

03:46.435 --> 03:48.687
To tea with the Progressive Mothers.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.856
She may as well have hung a noose
around her neck.

03:50.939 --> 03:53.567
Don't disparage her
when you don't even know her.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.986
I think she sounds spectacular.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.988
I'm going to help pave the way
for Miss Stacy.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.866
I know just how it is to be new
and judged harshly.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.784
That fox is gonna be dead meat.

04:02.868 --> 04:05.120
- I think I'll make it into a hat.
- Fox? What fox?

04:05.203 --> 04:07.414
The one with the dark tail
that's been stealing chickens.

04:07.497 --> 04:10.584
Well, there's no fox here
so how's about you put the gun away.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.711
I'd like to live to meet the new teacher.

04:20.719 --> 04:23.597
Ha. I just laid the world at your feet,
didn't I?

04:23.680 --> 04:25.557
Good morning, everyone!

04:25.640 --> 04:27.058
Good morning!

04:32.105 --> 04:35.609
- Here you go, little lady.
- My name is Miss Stacy.

04:36.151 --> 04:39.446
Please take that gun outside.
The classroom is no place for a weapon.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.573
Sure. I was... just about to do that.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.533
Miss Stacy is my new ideal!

04:43.617 --> 04:47.913
What a pretty room! So many windows.
I love to see green!

04:47.996 --> 04:50.123
She seems to be a kindred spirit!

04:50.749 --> 04:53.502
Alright, let's get to know each other.

04:53.919 --> 04:54.920
Please stand up.

05:00.425 --> 05:01.885
She's not wearing a corset.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.678
Oh, my goodness.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.430
Oh, my goodness.

05:05.514 --> 05:08.475
Now, please move all the desks to the side
and take a seat on the floor.

05:09.559 --> 05:10.727
The floor?!

05:10.811 --> 05:13.522
We're going to form a circle
and make introductions.

05:13.605 --> 05:14.689
Ah!

05:17.359 --> 05:19.444
Diana, I feel so uplifted!

05:19.528 --> 05:22.948
School is finally going to be everything
I dreamed it would be!

05:26.243 --> 05:27.744
Straight up.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.583
There we go.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.961
Careful now. There you go.
Lift up the end.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.839
Well, that should keep the chickens safe.

05:42.759 --> 05:45.512
- I hope we're the ones who catch the fox.
- I'll tell you what:

05:45.595 --> 05:47.847
I'll give you a share if we do.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.892
That pelt should fetch a nice price.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.572
Argh!

06:25.969 --> 06:28.179
And you'll say two words
that represent you,

06:28.263 --> 06:31.808
using the first letters
of your given name and surname.

06:32.642 --> 06:33.768
I'll start.

06:35.604 --> 06:36.813
Muriel Stacy.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.316
Mischievous.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.400
Scholastic.

06:40.483 --> 06:43.528
Those would be my descriptors
if we had the same initials.

06:43.612 --> 06:46.823
- Let's start with...
- It's like we were separated at birth.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.617
Ahem. Ruby Gillis.

06:54.039 --> 06:55.957
- Romantic...
- Ooh...

06:56.750 --> 06:58.585
Girl?!

06:58.668 --> 07:00.545
- Ruby Gillis.
- Well done.

07:00.629 --> 07:02.964
- Ruby has a crush on...
- Gilbert Blythe?

07:03.048 --> 07:04.424
Oh, um...

07:06.051 --> 07:07.636
Uh... Global...

07:07.719 --> 07:09.888
- He traveled the world for a year.
- And bookish.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.098
Everyone thinks
he's the smartest student.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.517
- Priscilla Andrews.
- But I won the spelling bee.

07:17.896 --> 07:19.481
Pragmatic...

07:19.814 --> 07:22.817
- Actualized.
- She left our former teacher at the altar.

07:23.860 --> 07:26.696
Perhaps you'd like to share your comment
with the class?

07:26.780 --> 07:30.075
Oh, well, it's no secret that Prissy
was affianced to our former teacher,

07:30.158 --> 07:31.576
but justifiably fled the wedding.

07:31.660 --> 07:34.579
I'll be happy to fill you in
about everyone in Avonlea,

07:34.663 --> 07:37.457
because I was an outsider once, too,
and I know how hard...

07:37.540 --> 07:40.168
No need to provide me with gossip.
I don't condone it.

07:40.669 --> 07:42.379
Oh, but nothing I said is a secret.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.674
If someone needs me to know something,
they'll tell me.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.970
Why don't you take your turn?
What's your name?

07:51.846 --> 07:54.474
Anne... Anne Shirley-Cuthbert.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.270
Anne. Uh...

08:00.063 --> 08:01.064
uh...

08:02.691 --> 08:04.567
Anne...

08:08.321 --> 08:11.491
I'm sure you'll think of some later.
Why don't you see me after class?

08:11.574 --> 08:12.909
Moody Spurgeon?

08:24.587 --> 08:26.256
- Ooh!
- I need your help!

08:26.339 --> 08:28.675
Rachel! Whatever's the matter?

08:28.758 --> 08:31.636
I've heard some shocking rumors
about our new teacher!

08:31.720 --> 08:34.264
Rumors. I thought
something terrible had happened.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.975
- It has!
- I'll put up some tea.

08:37.058 --> 08:39.436
As a member of the board of trustees,

08:40.020 --> 08:42.772
I was against hiring a female teacher.

08:43.273 --> 08:45.400
I said it was a dangerous innovation,

08:45.483 --> 08:47.944
but I was backed into a corner,
and now all this.

08:48.028 --> 08:48.945
All what?

08:49.029 --> 08:52.323
The Progressive Mothers
are all in a dither, that's what.

08:52.741 --> 08:56.661
I mean to find out the what
and the why of it today!

08:56.953 --> 08:57.996
You're coming with me.

08:58.079 --> 09:01.499
Rachel, I'll not be a party
to whatever plan you have hatched.

09:02.125 --> 09:05.086
You have a child in that school,
I don't.

09:05.170 --> 09:08.089
Whatever is happening there
is happening to Anne.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.800
So you are in a position
to ask this woman

09:10.884 --> 09:14.345
pressing questions
from a place of motherly concern.

09:14.429 --> 09:16.389
You really think there's cause to worry?

09:16.473 --> 09:20.727
If she's capable of corrupting
the young minds of Avonlea, then yes.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.189
We will stop by right after school.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.317
We'll take that loaf. To be neighborly.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.016
So I'm hoping you wouldn't mind
tutoring me.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.392
I'm worried I'm behind

10:01.476 --> 10:03.937
and I'm very serious about medicine
as my vocation.

10:04.020 --> 10:07.732
My husband accelerated his studies
and got early entrance into college.

10:07.816 --> 10:08.983
Husband?!

10:09.818 --> 10:11.736
I'm widowed, actually.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.863
Oh, how tragical.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.909
Anyway, with hard work,

10:17.992 --> 10:21.955
it's possible you could finish school
early and be pre-med next year.

10:22.038 --> 10:23.540
I'll do whatever it takes!

10:23.623 --> 10:26.793
Let's meet before class in the mornings
and get you started.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.254
Thank you. Thank you so much!

10:36.094 --> 10:38.555
If Gilbert is accelerating
in his studies, I'd like to, too.

10:38.638 --> 10:42.308
I have ever so many vocations in mind.
Oh! The list is endless, really.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.310
- Let's put our heads together...
- About that...

10:44.394 --> 10:47.188
After school every day works for me.
Let's start now!

10:47.272 --> 10:49.190
It's Anne, isn't it?

10:49.274 --> 10:50.650
With an E.

10:50.733 --> 10:54.195
Oh, I've thought of ever so many words
that represent me since this morning.

10:54.279 --> 10:57.949
I was planning on having a word with you
about telling tales out of school.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.786
But we're in school
and I was only trying to help...

11:01.870 --> 11:05.498
But I see I should include
respecting others' privacy as well.

11:06.541 --> 11:07.417
Oh.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.795
I'd like you to write an essay
on the perils of gossip

11:10.879 --> 11:13.798
and why it's important
to have empathy for others.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.803
It doesn't have to be long,
but it has to be meaningful.

11:25.977 --> 11:29.606
Appalling! Stupid! Clueless!
Anne Shirley-Cuthbert!

11:29.689 --> 11:32.025
- You're being too hard on yourself.
- I hate myself!

11:32.108 --> 11:34.819
I made a terrible impression
on beautiful Miss Stacy.

11:34.903 --> 11:37.697
- That's true, but it's nothing...
- Everything I said came out wrong!

11:37.780 --> 11:41.242
- That's true too, but it's always...
- Stop agreeing with me, Diana!

11:41.326 --> 11:42.702
You can fix this, Anne.

11:42.785 --> 11:46.331
I'm sure any essay you write
will be brilliant and resolve things.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.793
Gilbert will not outpace me either,

11:50.877 --> 11:53.254
just because he already knows
his stupid vocation!

11:53.338 --> 11:56.466
You heard it here, Diana: I am going
to write the best essay in the world!

11:56.549 --> 11:57.634
The world!

12:08.061 --> 12:10.271
Whoa.

12:10.355 --> 12:13.066
Argh!
Why can't I do anything right today?!

12:14.359 --> 12:15.360
Sorry.

12:17.528 --> 12:18.738
Have you seen my fox?

12:18.821 --> 12:21.032
I have not seen a fox, yours or otherwise.

12:21.741 --> 12:22.700
Wait, you have a fox?

12:22.784 --> 12:25.870
Can you think about an opener
for an essay on the perils of gossip?!

12:25.954 --> 12:28.456
Uh, will you please slow down?

12:28.539 --> 12:31.000
Will you please come back to school?!
I need your support!

12:31.084 --> 12:32.460
I'm not coming back.

12:32.543 --> 12:35.672
Life's too short.
I'm not accepted there, and you know that.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.925
Trust me, the new teacher won't let
anyone bully you, I'm sure of it.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.677
She's a champion of good. Ah!

12:40.760 --> 12:44.722
Anne, this is what I'm going to do
with my life. So I'm doing it.

12:44.806 --> 12:47.308
I can't think of what to write!
What am I going to do?!

12:47.392 --> 12:49.852
I have to impress her! She has to like me!

12:50.269 --> 12:52.438
Maybe you just need
a change of perspective.

12:52.522 --> 12:55.900
To... clear your head
and save my art's life?

12:55.984 --> 12:57.026
Sorry.

12:58.611 --> 13:02.198
Do you have a special place
we could go that might inspire?

13:03.032 --> 13:06.619
Get the ideas flowing?
Somewhere with a bit more scope?

13:10.707 --> 13:12.959
Come to me, Muse!!!

13:13.042 --> 13:14.794
You're crazy!

13:14.877 --> 13:16.713
Yes! Try it!

13:16.796 --> 13:19.424
Come to me, Muse!

13:20.466 --> 13:22.510
Come to me, Muse!

13:22.593 --> 13:23.886
Louder!

13:24.637 --> 13:27.932
Come to me, Muse!

13:46.242 --> 13:47.243
Good afternoon.

13:48.578 --> 13:50.079
Good afternoon, Miss Stacy.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.664
I'm Rachel Lynde,

13:51.748 --> 13:54.250
and this is my good friend,
Marilla Cuthbert.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.543
Hello.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.170
Is everything alright?

13:57.837 --> 14:00.965
You seem to be
in quite a state of disrepair.

14:01.049 --> 14:02.967
I'm often in this state.

14:03.051 --> 14:05.595
We brought you some bread
as a housewarming.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.389
How kind. I'd invite you in, but...

14:08.473 --> 14:12.060
We'd love to visit for a minute.
Thank you. How nice.

14:13.644 --> 14:16.189
Marilla has a child in your class,
so we felt it was important...

14:16.272 --> 14:19.400
Sorry about the mess.
I'm trying to diagnose the problem.

14:19.484 --> 14:21.611
With what... exactly?

14:21.694 --> 14:24.280
Oh, this is a motorized bicycle.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.532
I so enjoy tinkering
with mechanical things

14:26.616 --> 14:28.451
and figuring out what makes them tick.

14:29.077 --> 14:31.996
Confessedly, even though I desire
a peaceful country life,

14:32.080 --> 14:34.415
which is why I accepted this position,

14:34.499 --> 14:38.378
I do still love to race around freely,
wind in my hair.

14:39.170 --> 14:41.297
Yes, you are rather... unrestrained.

14:42.090 --> 14:44.050
I've never believed in corsets.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.052
Since I have a skeleton
that holds everything up,

14:46.135 --> 14:47.929
I've never felt the need.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.597
And trousers are quite liberating.

14:51.808 --> 14:55.103
I assume you're not affianced or married.

14:56.437 --> 14:57.563
Feel free to assume.

14:57.647 --> 15:00.817
Have you determined
that you're going to be an old maid, then?

15:00.900 --> 15:03.027
I didn't realize one had to decide.

15:03.111 --> 15:06.030
If you're not careful,
the matter will be decided for you.

15:06.114 --> 15:08.324
Poor Marilla here knows all too well

15:08.408 --> 15:10.660
the unfulfilled life
of an unmarried woman.

15:13.121 --> 15:14.205
Word to the wise:

15:14.288 --> 15:18.418
you're not doing yourself any favors
with all this... this...

15:18.501 --> 15:20.420
untidy whizzing about.

15:22.130 --> 15:24.048
Marilla, you should offer some advice.

15:24.132 --> 15:26.843
On how to be a spinster,
or how not to be one?

15:26.926 --> 15:30.805
Regardless, that kind of behavior
may fly in the big city, but not here.

15:30.888 --> 15:34.517
- Folks will get the wrong impression.
- I expect some already have.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.438
- Which child is yours?
- Oh, she's not mine exactly,

15:38.521 --> 15:39.939
but we think of her as so.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.649
My brother and I adopted her.

15:41.732 --> 15:43.359
Neither of them ever married.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.280
- Her name is Anne.
- With an E.

15:47.864 --> 15:49.449
I know just who she is.

15:49.532 --> 15:52.869
The board of trustees,
of which I am a founding member,

15:52.952 --> 15:56.747
hopes that your questionable...
standards

15:56.831 --> 15:58.541
will make an abrupt turn
for the better.

15:58.624 --> 16:01.711
If they do,
I'm sure you'll be the first to know.

16:02.170 --> 16:05.089
We ask that you remain conservative,

16:05.173 --> 16:07.425
virtuous and restrained
in front of the children.

16:07.508 --> 16:10.094
Otherwise, I can't imagine
you'll be the proper educator

16:10.178 --> 16:11.971
for the youth of Avonlea.

16:12.722 --> 16:15.266
- I see.
- I'm glad you do.

16:18.853 --> 16:22.231
Gossip lies eight times...
no, nine times...

16:22.315 --> 16:25.151
and tells a half-truth the tenth.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.403
That's not bad.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.752
Matthew! You set a trap?!

16:43.169 --> 16:44.921
It's alright. It's just a fox.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.881
No! He's my friend!

16:46.964 --> 16:49.550
Please, Matthew,
please take the trap away!

16:49.634 --> 16:51.552
I couldn't bear it
if something happened to him!

16:51.636 --> 16:54.013
Sorry, Anne,
we have to protect what's ours.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.057
That is the way of things.

16:56.140 --> 17:00.019
I hope your friend Mr. Fox
has got the good sense to stay away.

17:16.661 --> 17:18.454
Run! Run!

17:18.538 --> 17:20.455
Oh, good, you're not there.

17:51.821 --> 17:52.989
Ugh.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.125
Not a chance.

18:49.962 --> 18:53.049
I could use some help with the fence
this morning before you go.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.259
I can't.
Miss Stacy's expecting me early.

18:55.343 --> 18:58.054
I can't believe I could actually
be in college next year.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.556
Wait. What do you mean, next year?

19:00.640 --> 19:03.476
Well, I told you last night,
I'm accelerating my studies.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.895
Yeah, but leaving next year,
that was never the plan.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.689
I have a chance, finally,
to get something that I want.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.149
Why wouldn't I take it?

19:10.232 --> 19:13.069
I came here so we could work
this land together for two years

19:13.152 --> 19:16.697
until it comes back to life and
I've learned farming and then you'll go.

19:16.781 --> 19:19.075
Plan's changed. This is my future.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.911
Your future. What about mine?
You don't even consult me?

19:21.994 --> 19:24.080
- I thought we were in this together.
- We are.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.957
I don't know what I'm doing, Blythe!
This is a farm, not a ship!

19:27.041 --> 19:28.376
You have time to get up to speed.

19:28.459 --> 19:30.461
While I'm alone
and you're at school every minute?!

19:30.544 --> 19:32.713
- We can get you help.
- Nobody wants to know me,

19:32.797 --> 19:35.841
let alone work for me!
How do I do all this by myself?!

19:35.925 --> 19:37.635
You'll figure it out! I gotta go!

19:42.890 --> 19:45.893
And Rachel was extremely insulting.

19:46.769 --> 19:48.270
She crossed a line with me.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.022
Sorry to hear it.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.777
Why aren't you dressed?

19:55.319 --> 19:58.280
I'm afraid I can't go to school today.
I'm much too unwell.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.498
- You don't have a fever.
- Oh, woe is me!

20:07.581 --> 20:10.584
How I wish I didn't have to miss school.

20:10.668 --> 20:13.295
What have you got all over your fingers?

20:13.379 --> 20:16.006
Is that soot?

20:16.090 --> 20:18.968
- Uh... I-I...
- You smell like smoke.

20:19.593 --> 20:22.471
Anne Shirley-Cuthbert, tell the truth.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.308
If my fox wasn't in danger,
none of this would've happened!

20:26.392 --> 20:28.269
None of what?

20:33.399 --> 20:37.069
Lucky it was only your essay was burned
and not all of Green Gables.

20:37.153 --> 20:39.739
I can't go to school today! I just can't!

20:39.822 --> 20:43.701
Miss Stacy will never believe me and
I've already made the worst impression!

20:46.454 --> 20:49.457
I'll go along with you to explain things.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.667
This is a right queer tale
for sure and certain.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.169
Thank you, Marilla.

20:53.252 --> 20:57.465
Would you mind extolling all of my virtues
as well so that she'll like me better?

20:57.715 --> 20:59.425
Get yourself ready now.

21:09.727 --> 21:12.354
You and me,
we're going to get to know each other.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.692
It's going to be fine. Oh, yes.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.821
I think this is right.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.533
Easy.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.872
Hey, hey, hey. Whoa.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.416
Show mercy.

21:32.500 --> 21:35.920
Alright. Stay. Stay...

21:36.003 --> 21:37.630
No!!

21:40.341 --> 21:42.343
New plan.

21:53.395 --> 21:54.522
Oh.

21:55.397 --> 21:58.192
Alright, then. That wasn't so bad.

21:58.275 --> 22:00.069
Hey!

22:00.694 --> 22:03.072
Hey. Hey, hey!

22:03.155 --> 22:04.824
Ah...!

22:04.907 --> 22:06.492
Whoa! Hey, hey!

22:14.542 --> 22:17.378
- Jerry! Jerry, come here!
- What?

22:17.962 --> 22:19.421
Could you do me a favor?

22:22.174 --> 22:26.470
Would you mind maybe jamming the trap?
You know, rigging it so it won't work?

22:26.554 --> 22:30.015
- Why would I do that?
- To save my fox!

22:30.099 --> 22:32.476
But Mr. Cuthbert said
he'll split the profit with me!

22:32.560 --> 22:33.561
What?!

22:34.812 --> 22:37.523
When I leaned back into the window,
I hit my head,

22:37.606 --> 22:40.901
then my essay fell and the oil lamp fell,
and suddenly the pages were ablaze!

22:40.985 --> 22:44.863
I had the great idea to stomp on it
with my shoes and it went out.

22:44.947 --> 22:48.409
And then I realized that the essay
I'd poured my heart into was ruined.

22:48.492 --> 22:51.787
So I was hoping maybe I could
just tell you about it after school?

22:51.870 --> 22:53.455
Just the two of us.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.126
Oh.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.795
It just seems a shame
to have to write it again

22:59.878 --> 23:01.714
when it was perfect just as it was.

23:01.797 --> 23:04.925
I felt ever so inspired after the lesson.
I learned a lot.

23:05.009 --> 23:09.930
I'm sorry, but... you're going to have
to complete the assignment, Anne.

23:10.014 --> 23:11.682
I'll see to it that she does.

23:14.435 --> 23:16.395
Adversity can be a blessing.

23:22.026 --> 23:24.653
- I hope you weren't eavesdropping.
- I'm trying to study.

23:24.737 --> 23:27.489
I'm going to need Miss Stacy's help
with my vocation soon, too.

23:27.573 --> 23:29.408
Do whatever you want.

23:29.783 --> 23:32.161
What's happened to the desks,
if I may ask?

23:32.244 --> 23:35.164
I call it a forum for hands-on learning.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.750
What is your problem?

23:37.833 --> 23:39.752
How is your vocation mine?

23:40.419 --> 23:44.381
It's not. So sorry to interrupt.
Please carry on with your goals!

23:53.265 --> 23:55.559
Would you care to stay and observe?

23:55.643 --> 23:57.269
Why, thank you.

23:58.187 --> 23:59.647
I believe I would.

24:00.856 --> 24:03.359
Alright, class, let's begin.

24:03.734 --> 24:04.902
Gilbert?

24:07.321 --> 24:08.280
Please.

24:12.951 --> 24:17.456
Science changes the world for the better.
Does anyone know what electricity is?

24:18.374 --> 24:19.792
- Light.
- Yes. And?

24:19.875 --> 24:23.462
- A form of energy.
- Electricity is indeed a form of energy.

24:23.545 --> 24:26.590
- I was going to say that.
- If you've ever watched a thunderstorm,

24:26.674 --> 24:29.718
with mighty lightning bolts
darting down from the sky,

24:29.802 --> 24:32.805
that's electricity. Powerful stuff.

24:33.389 --> 24:37.017
A bolt of lightning is a sudden,
massive surge of electricity

24:37.101 --> 24:39.937
between the sky and the ground beneath.

24:40.020 --> 24:42.523
Electrical currents live inside atoms.

24:42.606 --> 24:46.568
And atoms are small particles
that make up all matter.

24:46.652 --> 24:50.823
They're so small that it takes
billions and billions of them

24:50.906 --> 24:53.617
just to make something useful
like a nail.

24:55.452 --> 24:59.665
All objects that take up space
and have mass are called matter.

24:59.748 --> 25:02.042
And everything around you
is made up of matter.

25:02.126 --> 25:04.128
Chocolate cake is made up of matter.

25:04.211 --> 25:06.880
These walls,
the school is made up of matter.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.133
You are made up of matter.

25:10.008 --> 25:12.428
Now, today,
without a standard power source,

25:12.511 --> 25:14.430
like they have in the big cities,

25:14.513 --> 25:17.307
we are going to make
our own electric current

25:17.391 --> 25:19.560
in order to illuminate...

25:20.436 --> 25:22.563
- a light bulb.
- Whoa.

25:22.646 --> 25:25.524
How many of you have ever seen one?

25:25.816 --> 25:28.277
- In New York, actually.
- In Charlottetown.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.863
Uh, my aunt Josephine has electricity.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.948
Well, with a light bulb,

25:33.031 --> 25:36.785
scientists have found a way
to send electric currents...

25:36.869 --> 25:41.290
atoms carrying energy...
into a container full of gas...

25:41.373 --> 25:43.167
a different type of atom...

25:43.250 --> 25:46.211
and when those two types of atoms meet,

25:46.295 --> 25:49.131
they exchange their energy and make...

25:49.214 --> 25:50.549
Light!

25:50.758 --> 25:52.885
So, here in Avonlea,

25:52.968 --> 25:56.597
with a little ingenuity and some
Prince Edward Island potatoes,

25:56.680 --> 25:59.016
we have... electricity.

26:04.229 --> 26:05.898
Ahem-hem-hem.

26:05.981 --> 26:07.274
Ahem-hem-hem-hem!

26:08.567 --> 26:09.651
Why, hello!

26:09.735 --> 26:12.196
Ahem. Good timing.
We were just brightening our day.

26:12.279 --> 26:13.447
Won't you join us?

26:15.866 --> 26:17.701
- Miss Stacy's wonderful.
- Yes.

26:17.785 --> 26:21.121
Does it taste like chocolate?

26:21.205 --> 26:22.331
- Moody, no!
- Don't!

26:22.414 --> 26:23.999
Ah!

26:24.082 --> 26:25.667
Moody, no.

26:25.751 --> 26:26.960
Moody!

26:27.044 --> 26:29.713
- Everyone stand still right where you are.
- My child, my child!

26:29.797 --> 26:31.882
Please stay back. Thank you.

26:31.965 --> 26:33.509
Let's keep our heads.

26:33.592 --> 26:36.261
Logic dictates
there are no shards under your feet,

26:36.345 --> 26:38.180
and I'd like to keep it that way.

26:38.889 --> 26:40.224
I'll fetch a broom.

27:02.371 --> 27:04.832
Boy. Hey.

27:18.887 --> 27:20.639
You owe me $5.

27:21.348 --> 27:22.599
Sebastian?

27:26.979 --> 27:28.146
Mary.

27:32.276 --> 27:33.777
What are you doing here?

27:36.488 --> 27:37.865
I don't know.

27:42.995 --> 27:46.081
Let's get you away from here.
What if that glass had cut your face?

27:46.164 --> 27:47.666
Mother, please, it was my fault!

27:47.749 --> 27:50.002
You should've been sitting,
safe and sound, at a desk!

27:50.085 --> 27:52.504
We expect this classroom
to be orderly and calm,

27:52.588 --> 27:55.007
and we expect you to conform
to the curriculum.

27:55.090 --> 27:57.426
Science is part of the course of study.

27:57.509 --> 28:00.220
That wasn't science,
that was prestidigitation.

28:00.304 --> 28:02.055
Oh, for heaven's sake.

28:02.139 --> 28:04.433
It was an excellent lesson.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.101
We want our children to learn,

28:06.184 --> 28:09.813
safely, what is required to prepare
them for higher education.

28:09.897 --> 28:11.106
Not the circus.

28:11.189 --> 28:16.028
Pardon me. Miss Stacy is a dedicated,
capable teacher.

28:16.111 --> 28:19.698
I hope to be exactly like her someday.
She is a smart, lovely career woman

28:19.781 --> 28:23.785
who is a superior educator
despite overcoming a tragical romance.

28:24.453 --> 28:27.497
Good thing you'll be writing
that essay on gossip again.

28:27.581 --> 28:31.418
The Progressive Mothers lobbied hard
for the first female teacher in Avonlea.

28:32.336 --> 28:34.963
Please don't squander the opportunity.

28:46.350 --> 28:48.060
You have to talk to him.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.812
Tell Gilbert how you feel.

28:50.896 --> 28:52.940
You had an agreement and he broke it.

28:53.941 --> 28:57.527
I don't want to stand in his way.
He's following his dream.

28:57.611 --> 29:00.113
Even at the expense of yours?

29:00.197 --> 29:02.991
Everything is different
from how I thought it would be.

29:03.825 --> 29:07.079
I thought farming was finally...
the life for me,

29:07.162 --> 29:09.081
but now I don't know...

29:10.374 --> 29:13.168
Being outside,
working with your hands,

29:13.252 --> 29:17.673
where everything you do every day
counts for something.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.384
Sounds like a life to me.

29:23.178 --> 29:26.390
What I do know
is that I'm not going backwards.

29:27.099 --> 29:28.392
I'm done on the ships.

29:29.726 --> 29:32.437
After ten years,
I really hoped to stay in one place.

29:32.521 --> 29:33.981
Ten years?

29:34.523 --> 29:35.983
But you're so young.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.777
Old on the inside.

29:40.988 --> 29:42.990
Is there any work here in the Bog?

29:43.615 --> 29:45.284
If you're willing to take it.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.452
Why wouldn't I take it?

29:47.536 --> 29:50.122
Colored folks do the jobs
white folks won't.

29:50.205 --> 29:55.043
So if you're willing to fetch and tote
and scrub and haul, you'll be all set.

29:55.127 --> 29:57.546
Could I buy my own land here?
Homestead?

29:57.629 --> 30:00.924
That's a big dream, a wonderful dream...
I understand it...

30:01.008 --> 30:04.219
but... you gotta understand...

30:04.636 --> 30:07.097
dreams don't come true in the Bog.

30:11.351 --> 30:12.811
Maybe they do.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.037
It's getting late.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.582
Would you like to come for supper?

30:35.250 --> 30:37.919
There's nothing more
I've ever wanted in this world.

30:46.511 --> 30:47.346
Well.

30:48.472 --> 30:50.682
This day went differently
than I'd imagined.

30:50.974 --> 30:54.519
- May we walk you partway home?
- You're very kind.

30:54.603 --> 30:57.689
Personally, I like not having to read
books every day.

30:58.899 --> 31:00.108
Was that meant to be consoling?

31:00.192 --> 31:02.944
Leave the fox alone, Billy!
He's an innocent creature!

31:03.028 --> 31:05.197
He's my new hat!

31:12.954 --> 31:15.540
May I meet you at home, Marilla?
I need to make a stop.

31:15.624 --> 31:18.293
You've got an essay to write.
Before dark.

31:19.086 --> 31:21.546
It's a matter of some urgency
regarding my fox.

31:21.630 --> 31:24.716
Oh, yes, your friend the fox,
foe of homework.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.636
It won't take long.
You could come with me.

31:27.719 --> 31:31.014
Just promise that you'll never tell a soul
about what you're going to see.

31:44.111 --> 31:45.904
Please pretend none of this exists.

31:46.655 --> 31:48.198
Anne Shirley-Cuthbert.

31:48.281 --> 31:50.659
Is that your lunch
you're leaving on the ground?

31:50.742 --> 31:53.662
My fox must be hungry. That's
the only reason he's stealing chickens.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.914
I have to feed him to protect him.

31:55.997 --> 31:58.333
This is extraordinary.

31:59.251 --> 32:02.170
You've created an enchanted kingdom here.

32:03.547 --> 32:06.258
Oh, it gives me such a thrill
that you perceive it so!

32:07.134 --> 32:09.845
I devote myself to my education here,
just so you know.

32:09.928 --> 32:14.182
I created a story club, and we write
and critique each other's work.

32:14.266 --> 32:18.603
This place provides so much scope
for the imagination, don't you agree?

32:18.937 --> 32:20.480
Who made these sculptures?

32:20.564 --> 32:23.358
Cole. Aren't they magnificent?

32:24.192 --> 32:27.070
Cole is my friend and a brilliant artist.

32:27.154 --> 32:30.365
He's really honing his talents
now he refuses to go to school.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.284
Why isn't he in school?

32:32.367 --> 32:34.870
He's been bullied. Oh!

32:34.953 --> 32:36.371
Is it gossip if I tell you that?

32:36.455 --> 32:40.709
But I'd dearly love to tell you,
because I'm sure you could help.

32:40.792 --> 32:43.295
If I really need to know
and if I could help him,

32:43.378 --> 32:45.213
you should tell me.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.716
Gossip is another thing entirely.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.429
Why don't we all go in?

33:08.236 --> 33:10.071
Won't you please sit down?

33:27.214 --> 33:29.341
If you wouldn't mind pinky swearing.

33:35.514 --> 33:40.185
We hereby swear to protect
the sanctity of this sacred space.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.020
I swear.

33:43.104 --> 33:44.523
I swear.

33:46.233 --> 33:47.442
Bash!

33:48.443 --> 33:50.862
Just wait till you see
what I got you for supper.

33:51.863 --> 33:54.449
Thought you could teach me
to make Crab Callaloo.

33:54.866 --> 33:56.660
A little taste of home.

34:37.284 --> 34:38.952
Smells like paradise.

34:40.453 --> 34:42.163
You think you're in heaven?

34:42.496 --> 34:43.623
No.

34:45.417 --> 34:46.835
Feels more like home.

35:51.775 --> 35:54.069
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

36:02.118 --> 36:03.411
Anybody home?

36:32.816 --> 36:34.275
Whoo!

36:52.627 --> 36:54.129
Easy, Tina.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.463
Ooh.

36:58.883 --> 37:00.969
Morning.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.762
- Have far to go?
- I'm not sure.

37:02.846 --> 37:04.973
I'm headed to the Mackenzie farm?

37:05.056 --> 37:08.977
That's still a fair ways on foot.
I'm happy to drop you off, if you like.

37:09.060 --> 37:12.731
Oh, I'd be much obliged.
I don't have much time before school.

37:12.814 --> 37:16.526
You must be the infamous Miss Stacy.
I'm Harmon Andrews.

37:16.609 --> 37:17.652
Oh.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.238
Infamous. Well.

37:20.864 --> 37:22.782
Let's just say I've heard of you.

37:22.866 --> 37:24.451
Come on, Tina.

37:58.109 --> 38:00.153
Ah!

38:10.121 --> 38:11.080
Are you alright?!

38:12.499 --> 38:14.584
Why won't you listen to me?!

38:20.131 --> 38:22.509
- Anne. Anne!
- Leave her be.

38:23.301 --> 38:24.969
Think of something else.

38:25.386 --> 38:27.931
Sometimes you just have
to use your imagination.

38:35.396 --> 38:39.150
And I learned that your son
has faced difficulties at school.

38:39.943 --> 38:41.319
Difficulties?

38:42.153 --> 38:44.739
- He's smart enough.
- It seems he's been bullied.

38:44.823 --> 38:47.700
So I thought
we might discuss it all together.

38:47.784 --> 38:49.536
- Maybe I can help.
- Bullied.

38:49.619 --> 38:51.996
Yes. It-it's my understanding

38:52.080 --> 38:55.750
that it might be because...
Cole stands out...

38:55.834 --> 38:57.544
from the rest of the children.

38:58.670 --> 39:01.756
- What did he have to say about all this?
- Say about it?

39:01.840 --> 39:03.716
Yes. When you talked to him.

39:04.425 --> 39:06.261
I-I haven't met him yet.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.555
Apparently, he hasn't been to school
for quite some time?

39:08.638 --> 39:10.473
He goes every day...

39:10.557 --> 39:12.100
with his books.

39:12.475 --> 39:13.977
Every morning.

39:18.565 --> 39:19.899
Cole?!

39:19.983 --> 39:21.776
Cole, come here!

39:21.860 --> 39:23.111
I'm sorry, I...

39:23.194 --> 39:25.196
We've made sacrifices
to allow him schooling.

39:25.280 --> 39:28.199
If he's not going,
we need him here, working the farm.

39:28.283 --> 39:29.576
Cole!

39:32.537 --> 39:33.872
Ready for school?

39:34.664 --> 39:38.167
- Just about to set off.
- I saw your sculptures, Cole.

39:38.251 --> 39:39.919
You're a gifted artist.

39:40.545 --> 39:42.130
Seems you've yet to meet the new teacher.

39:43.965 --> 39:45.466
Seems you've been lying to us.

39:48.094 --> 39:50.430
Cole! Cole, come back here right now!

39:50.513 --> 39:51.598
Cole!

40:31.137 --> 40:32.430
You sold me out!

40:34.140 --> 40:35.350
I trusted you!

40:36.434 --> 40:39.354
- What are you talking about?
- You brought the teacher here!

40:39.437 --> 40:43.775
You told her about me!
Are you that desperate to be liked?!

40:46.361 --> 40:49.572
She told my parents I'm not in school!

40:50.782 --> 40:53.785
- I was trying to help.
- Well, you ruined my life!

40:55.870 --> 41:00.208
They'll never let me leave the farm now,
not even for school!

41:00.875 --> 41:02.460
It's over!

41:02.794 --> 41:04.462
I have nothing!

41:10.134 --> 41:12.428
Who would do this?
Do you know who did this?

41:12.512 --> 41:14.305
- No.
- Who else did you show?!

41:14.389 --> 41:16.015
No one! I don't...

41:16.099 --> 41:17.558
I don't know.

41:32.532 --> 41:33.491
Cole.

41:36.327 --> 41:37.453
Cole!

41:39.330 --> 41:40.999
Where are you going?!

41:53.219 --> 41:55.346
Now, I don't know whose it was.

41:55.430 --> 41:57.056
Definitely no one in here.

41:57.598 --> 42:00.435
All those books and sculptures.

42:00.518 --> 42:01.769
I took out one...

42:01.853 --> 42:04.605
I shot every one.
I missed probably one shot.

42:13.156 --> 42:14.741
Miss Stacy?

42:14.824 --> 42:15.867
Everything alright?

42:17.285 --> 42:18.536
Mm-hmm.

42:27.128 --> 42:28.796
Cole!

42:28.880 --> 42:30.465
Wait! Cole!

42:31.466 --> 42:34.052
Stop it!

42:36.763 --> 42:38.181
Wait!

42:38.264 --> 42:40.058
Get... off!

42:40.141 --> 42:42.685
- No, no, no! Don't hurt him!
- Freak!

42:42.769 --> 42:45.146
Hey, hey!

43:22.433 --> 43:23.935
Cole! Cole!
