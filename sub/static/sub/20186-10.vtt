00:00.031 --> 00:03.297
<i>Previously on AMC's Better Call Saul...</i>

00:03.352 --> 00:05.032
Should I settle?

00:05.344 --> 00:09.140
_

00:11.415 --> 00:12.880
Hector Salamanca.

00:13.008 --> 00:15.281
- Turn the lights on.
- I'm back to normal.

00:15.283 --> 00:17.421
You'd rather tear down HHM than retire.

00:17.424 --> 00:20.008
You think I'm trouble now?
Imagine me as your enemy.

00:20.010 --> 00:22.289
It's a new client, and if I
mess this up, it's a <i> former</i> client.

00:22.291 --> 00:25.609
Sandpiper is settling. This is
the solution to everything!

00:25.611 --> 00:27.398
I'll be back in a few hours.

00:32.797 --> 00:36.067
"It was very still
except for the tree-toads

00:36.100 --> 00:40.405
and the frogs in the brook
peeping mournfully,

00:40.437 --> 00:42.607
and every little while

00:42.639 --> 00:45.343
Mabel could hear strange
rustlings in the leaves.

00:45.375 --> 00:48.312
She tried to remember the way home,

00:48.346 --> 00:50.448
but the woods looked so different now

00:50.480 --> 00:53.550
that she couldn't think which way to go.

00:53.584 --> 00:56.053
She began to be frightened.

00:56.087 --> 00:57.922
'What's that?' said Mabel.

00:57.954 --> 01:00.524
'Oh, I'm... I'm so frightened!'

01:00.558 --> 01:03.560
In a minute or two she
heard the howl again...

01:03.593 --> 01:06.864
'O-o-o-w!'...

01:06.897 --> 01:10.101
a long, wild cry.

01:10.133 --> 01:14.604
She began to run, but the
poor thing had lost her way."

01:14.638 --> 01:16.940
Is she gonna be okay?

01:16.974 --> 01:19.811
- She'll be fine, Jimmy.
- How do you know?

01:19.843 --> 01:22.946
Just listen. You'll see.

01:25.715 --> 01:27.718
"It was so dark that she stumbled

01:27.751 --> 01:29.920
over the bushes and the
roots of the trees..."

02:02.131 --> 02:03.131
Kim.

02:10.107 --> 02:11.309
I know.

02:16.646 --> 02:18.381
Does she need to spend the night?

02:18.414 --> 02:20.952
Once this is done,
she'll be discharged.

02:23.919 --> 02:26.256
Good.

03:17.840 --> 03:19.677
Lawsuits.

03:19.709 --> 03:22.046
Threats. Recriminations.

03:22.078 --> 03:25.683
This is a situation no
firm ever wants to be in.

03:25.715 --> 03:28.052
It's... well, it's embarrassing.

03:29.785 --> 03:33.122
I know we all want a
swift resolution here.

03:33.155 --> 03:35.792
So what are our options?

03:35.826 --> 03:37.728
Take it to trial.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.128
Expensive.

03:39.161 --> 03:42.432
And extremely damaging
for HHM's reputation.

03:42.465 --> 03:47.136
Not my first choice or yours, I imagine.

03:47.170 --> 03:49.940
The firm could choose to buy me out

03:49.973 --> 03:55.112
for an amount that is almost
certain to bankrupt it.

03:55.145 --> 03:57.414
I spent decades building this firm.

03:57.446 --> 04:00.717
I don't want to be the
agent of its destruction.

04:02.486 --> 04:04.855
There is a third option.

04:04.887 --> 04:06.223
There's no reason

04:06.255 --> 04:09.860
we can't put all this
unpleasantness behind us

04:09.892 --> 04:13.097
and continue on as we have been.

04:13.129 --> 04:16.399
I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.

04:16.433 --> 04:18.836
And if you agree,

04:18.868 --> 04:21.738
I think we can settle all this right now

04:21.772 --> 04:23.708
with a simple handshake.

04:26.542 --> 04:28.913
Would you all give us
the room for a moment?

04:48.899 --> 04:51.135
17 years.

04:51.168 --> 04:55.072
18 in July, actually.

04:55.104 --> 04:59.242
All those years we built
this place together.

04:59.275 --> 05:03.179
And all that time I've supported you.

05:03.212 --> 05:05.915
Looked up to you,

05:05.948 --> 05:08.184
deferred to you.

05:08.217 --> 05:09.552
Because I always thought

05:09.585 --> 05:12.355
you had the best interests
of the firm in mind.

05:12.388 --> 05:13.489
I have...

05:13.522 --> 05:16.893
Mnh. You did.

05:16.926 --> 05:18.962
For a long time.

05:18.995 --> 05:21.098
But you've let personal vendettas

05:21.130 --> 05:23.967
turn your focus away from
what's best for HHM.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.869
You've put your needs first.

05:25.902 --> 05:28.070
- To our detriment.
- I don't think that's accurate.

05:28.104 --> 05:30.106
And the moment that I mildly suggest,

05:30.140 --> 05:31.808
with empathy and concern,

05:31.842 --> 05:36.180
that maybe it's time for you
to consider retirement...

05:36.212 --> 05:39.383
the first instinct you
have is to sue me?!

05:39.416 --> 05:42.319
To sue the firm...?

05:42.351 --> 05:47.190
Well, I... I-I
don't even know...

05:49.125 --> 05:53.197
I-In what world is that anything
but the deepest betrayal

05:53.229 --> 05:56.133
of everything we worked
so hard to accomplish?

05:56.166 --> 05:57.433
In what world is that anything

05:57.467 --> 05:59.169
but the deepest betrayal
of our friendship?

05:59.202 --> 06:01.839
Howard. I could argue that
you're the one who betrayed me.

06:01.871 --> 06:03.407
That's bullshit.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.109
And you know it.

06:08.510 --> 06:10.147
This is pointless.

06:13.149 --> 06:14.484
Here.

06:14.517 --> 06:16.153
Just take this.

06:19.388 --> 06:21.557
$3 million?

06:21.591 --> 06:23.093
The first of three payments,

06:23.125 --> 06:24.560
as per the partnership agreement.

06:24.594 --> 06:26.363
The firm can't afford this.

06:26.395 --> 06:28.064
Are you...

06:28.097 --> 06:29.899
You're not shutting down, are you?

06:29.933 --> 06:32.536
I would never endanger the firm.

06:32.568 --> 06:35.438
This is mostly from my personal funds.

06:35.472 --> 06:37.474
And a few loans.

06:41.176 --> 06:43.847
You're paying me out of your own pocket.

06:48.418 --> 06:49.987
You won.

07:01.063 --> 07:03.066
There's one last thing...

07:26.388 --> 07:28.291
Everybody!

07:29.426 --> 07:31.094
Thank you for gathering.

07:31.126 --> 07:33.629
I have some bittersweet news to share.

07:33.662 --> 07:37.433
I'm sorry to say, but our
fearless leader, Charles McGill,

07:37.467 --> 07:39.068
will be leaving HHM.

07:39.101 --> 07:40.436
Effective immediately.

07:40.469 --> 07:43.106
I wanted to take this
moment to thank Chuck

07:43.138 --> 07:45.241
for everything he's done for HHM.

07:45.274 --> 07:47.243
We started off with six employees.

07:47.277 --> 07:48.645
And Chuck helped grow us

07:48.678 --> 07:51.048
into one of the largest
firms in the state.

07:51.080 --> 07:55.118
We will be forever grateful
for his dedication.

07:57.419 --> 07:59.489
Do you have anything you want to say?

08:03.525 --> 08:06.996
Alright, then. Let's give him a hand!

09:18.835 --> 09:20.637
Hey.

09:20.669 --> 09:22.072
Morning.

09:22.105 --> 09:24.108
Close.

09:29.511 --> 09:30.479
Gatorade.

09:30.513 --> 09:32.483
You need electrolytes.

09:38.353 --> 09:40.289
You hungry?

09:42.826 --> 09:45.529
I'll make you somethin'.

09:45.562 --> 09:48.365
Be right back. Just finish that.

09:56.305 --> 09:57.807
Hey.

10:00.275 --> 10:02.078
I said I'd bring it to you.

10:02.111 --> 10:04.113
I needed to stretch my legs.

10:04.146 --> 10:06.249
Sit. Eggs.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.491
This is, uh, twisted.

10:14.524 --> 10:16.125
Oh, thanks.

10:18.361 --> 10:22.698
This one-handed crap is gonna
get real old, real fast.

10:27.703 --> 10:29.572
Is there coffee?

10:29.606 --> 10:33.510
Sure. But, uh, more Gatorade first.

10:40.683 --> 10:44.386
Alright, your, uh, two options are...

10:44.419 --> 10:46.622
good ole' ibuprofen

10:46.655 --> 10:48.724
which, uh, you know,
should take the edge off.

10:48.757 --> 10:51.393
Or the proverbial "good stuff."

10:55.398 --> 10:57.767
The answer is always "the good stuff."

10:57.799 --> 10:59.535
Right. But food first.

11:20.255 --> 11:22.558
You're not feeding me, Jimmy.

11:22.592 --> 11:24.827
There are lines we do not cross.

11:33.502 --> 11:35.738
I was looking into our
lease on the office.

11:35.771 --> 11:38.440
Um, we'd definitely take a
haircut if we broke it.

11:38.473 --> 11:40.309
But we are allowed to sublet.

11:40.342 --> 11:41.745
Might be our best option.

11:41.778 --> 11:43.813
Furniture's mostly
rented month to month.

11:43.846 --> 11:45.582
So that's not an issue.

11:45.615 --> 11:50.620
For you, I think you need a
desk, some file cabinets.

11:50.653 --> 11:52.556
A Westlaw terminal...

11:52.588 --> 11:55.824
And, uh, haven't figured
out Francesca yet.

11:55.857 --> 11:59.261
That's another conversation.

11:59.294 --> 12:01.397
All that sound okay?

12:02.932 --> 12:05.601
Are you sure about this?

12:05.635 --> 12:08.904
I mean, even with the
Sandpiper money...?

12:08.938 --> 12:13.643
Look. After, uh...

12:13.675 --> 12:15.444
everything...

12:18.347 --> 12:20.851
I don't give a shit about the office.

12:28.524 --> 12:31.727
So can I start looking for a tenant?

12:31.760 --> 12:33.929
Yeah.

12:33.962 --> 12:35.498
Yeah.

12:45.574 --> 12:49.278
I could've killed someone, Jimmy.

12:49.312 --> 12:51.548
Yeah.<i> Yourself.</i>

12:53.548 --> 12:56.519
I worked most of last week
on maybe six hours of sleep.

12:56.552 --> 12:57.788
And then I...

12:59.822 --> 13:01.558
I crossed three lanes of traffic,

13:01.591 --> 13:03.393
and I don't remember any of it...

13:03.425 --> 13:07.329
Look, you were just doing what
you thought you had to do.

13:07.362 --> 13:09.933
- Because of me.
- You didn't make me get in that car.

13:09.966 --> 13:11.534
That was all me.

13:13.468 --> 13:16.539
I'm an adult. I made a choice.

13:31.453 --> 13:33.455
Hey.

13:33.489 --> 13:35.592
All I can say is,

13:35.625 --> 13:39.895
I am gonna fix things.

14:11.931 --> 14:14.667
Okay. So, we're gonna
do everything around back.

14:14.700 --> 14:18.504
It's mostly commercial around
here, so it's quiet at night.

14:18.538 --> 14:20.474
<i>We pull the trucks up to the doors.</i>

14:20.506 --> 14:21.909
We unload right into the shop.

14:23.543 --> 14:25.512
We can break down the stuff in here.

14:25.545 --> 14:28.748
There's space in the
back for storing scales

14:28.781 --> 14:31.751
and, uh, supplies when the shop's open.

14:31.785 --> 14:35.088
Should be able to process
everything overnight.

14:35.121 --> 14:37.124
I'd be here to see it gets done right...

14:37.156 --> 14:40.227
Where's, uh, Papi?

14:40.260 --> 14:42.663
I'll be taking care of all this.

14:42.695 --> 14:44.797
But he's good.

14:44.830 --> 14:46.699
Once we get everything packed,

14:46.732 --> 14:49.001
Arturo will pick up
and supervise distro,

14:49.035 --> 14:50.871
uh, make sure everything is clear.

14:50.904 --> 14:53.207
Here's Papi!

14:53.240 --> 14:54.674
Ah.

15:05.618 --> 15:07.220
Don Hector...

15:07.401 --> 15:09.704
_

15:09.969 --> 15:12.360
_

15:17.228 --> 15:19.398
_

15:19.579 --> 15:21.946
_

15:31.011 --> 15:32.746
Mm.

15:43.837 --> 15:44.876
_

15:45.091 --> 15:46.126
Mm?

15:49.966 --> 15:51.735
_

15:52.774 --> 15:56.001
_

15:56.048 --> 15:57.985
_

15:58.446 --> 16:00.219
_

16:06.979 --> 16:08.615
Papá...

16:11.001 --> 16:14.469
_

16:16.204 --> 16:18.985
_

16:23.079 --> 16:24.790
_

16:55.160 --> 16:57.765
He's old-fashioned. He'll come around.

17:04.170 --> 17:05.838
Don Hector.

17:10.142 --> 17:11.911
I'll talk to him.

17:11.944 --> 17:13.847
He'll come around.

17:15.848 --> 17:18.151
I don't trust him.

17:26.858 --> 17:28.928
These are from Kevin and Paige.

17:28.962 --> 17:31.698
Well, I guess they're from
everybody at Mesa Verde.

17:31.730 --> 17:33.266
Oh! And there's a card.

17:33.298 --> 17:35.001
Somewhere in here.

17:35.035 --> 17:37.336
Ah, here!

17:37.370 --> 17:39.072
You brought the book?

17:39.104 --> 17:41.007
Um, sure.

17:47.080 --> 17:49.082
Mr. Gatwood.

17:49.114 --> 17:50.750
The card wasn't clear,

17:50.784 --> 17:53.352
but I'm pretty sure you're
getting steaks, too.

17:53.385 --> 17:54.887
Really?

17:54.920 --> 17:57.056
Texas.

17:57.090 --> 17:59.192
He wishes you a speedy recovery.

17:59.225 --> 18:00.727
Mm-hmm.

18:03.295 --> 18:04.398
Okay.

18:04.430 --> 18:08.101
You are so lucky.

18:08.133 --> 18:11.137
I, um, I used to drive
that highway every weekend

18:11.170 --> 18:13.305
to visit my brother and his kids,

18:13.339 --> 18:16.977
and I saw an accident
almost every single time.

18:17.009 --> 18:20.814
People die on that road all the time.

18:25.150 --> 18:28.220
I-I already rescheduled
everything you had this week.

18:28.254 --> 18:31.257
But I didn't touch that
meeting with the regulator.

18:31.291 --> 18:34.327
I know that whole Utah
timeline is delicate, so...

18:34.360 --> 18:36.063
Right. It's next Wednesday, right?

18:36.095 --> 18:38.330
Yes. And there's still a
lot of prep that we pushed

18:38.363 --> 18:40.400
so you could focus on getting Mr.
Gatwood up

18:40.432 --> 18:41.767
by the end of the quarter.

18:41.801 --> 18:43.837
Which isn't happening now.

18:43.870 --> 18:46.039
Actually...? I talked with Colleen,

18:46.072 --> 18:49.275
and she said everyone's fine
doing that meeting Monday.

18:49.308 --> 18:53.846
So, you know, that means
we could still slide in

18:53.880 --> 18:56.249
just under the deadline...

18:57.316 --> 18:58.919
Uh.

18:58.951 --> 19:00.286
Did you bring a breakdown

19:00.320 --> 19:01.996
of the documents I'll
need for next Wednesday?

19:02.020 --> 19:03.198
I would... I would have to figure out...

19:03.222 --> 19:04.324
Yep.

19:04.356 --> 19:05.791
how long that'll take me.

19:05.824 --> 19:06.860
Right.

19:10.429 --> 19:13.833
That's four, six.

19:13.866 --> 19:15.468
Go to 11.

19:29.015 --> 19:31.251
Found it. Here you go.

19:31.284 --> 19:33.754
And Paige's timeline's on the top.

19:34.954 --> 19:36.490
Kim?

19:36.523 --> 19:41.026
Y-You okay? I-I can always come back...

19:41.060 --> 19:43.463
I'm gonna need you to cancel Gatwood

19:43.496 --> 19:45.031
and push everything else.

19:45.064 --> 19:46.466
What? E-Everything?

19:46.498 --> 19:47.933
Yeah. Everything.

19:47.967 --> 19:49.803
Uh. Okay.

19:49.835 --> 19:52.772
But first, could you give me a ride?

19:52.805 --> 19:56.109
Absolutely. Where to?

19:56.141 --> 19:58.844
<i>Ms.
Wexler sends her apologies, Mr. Gatwood.</i>

19:58.878 --> 20:00.413
A-And she feels terrible about this,

20:00.446 --> 20:02.314
but with her accident
and the recovery...

20:02.347 --> 20:06.452
she's just not gonna be able to
finish her work for you in time.

20:06.486 --> 20:08.854
Oh, of course, I'll tell her.

20:08.888 --> 20:10.791
A-And again, she is very sorry,

20:10.824 --> 20:13.526
and I know she'll be giving
you a call herself soon.

20:13.560 --> 20:16.062
Well, yes.

20:16.094 --> 20:17.863
Ms. Wexler did ask me to tell you

20:17.897 --> 20:20.133
she strongly recommends
Schweikart and Cokely.

20:20.166 --> 20:22.402
They're an exceptional firm.

20:22.435 --> 20:26.273
Okay. Well, I will send
that info over today.

20:26.305 --> 20:29.308
A-And Ms. W-Wexler will
follow up herself shortly.

20:29.342 --> 20:30.514
"Thanks for the meat."

20:30.516 --> 20:33.180
Uh. A-And she says thank
you for the steaks.

20:33.212 --> 20:35.147
She's so excited to fire up that grill.

20:36.481 --> 20:38.517
Thank you. B-Bye!

20:38.551 --> 20:40.821
Okay. How many do I have?

20:40.853 --> 20:42.555
Nine...

20:42.589 --> 20:43.957
Good.

21:25.631 --> 21:28.935
It's Jimmy.

21:28.968 --> 21:30.536
I know you don't wanna see me,

21:30.570 --> 21:33.173
but, uh, I just want
to know you're okay.

21:36.676 --> 21:39.880
C'mon, Chuck. I just
want to see your face.

21:39.912 --> 21:41.614
C'mon, Chuck. I just need a minute.

21:41.648 --> 21:43.550
I just need to know you're alright.

21:46.352 --> 21:48.121
I'm alright, Jimmy.

21:48.153 --> 21:49.922
Oh, hey. Good.

21:49.956 --> 21:52.058
I mean, I'm glad you're alright.

21:52.091 --> 21:53.059
I...

21:53.092 --> 21:55.160
Uh... can I come in?

21:55.193 --> 21:57.029
Just talk for a minute...?

22:40.640 --> 22:43.509
As you can see, I'm more than alright.

22:43.543 --> 22:45.277
I'm very well, in fact.

22:56.189 --> 22:58.057
How...?

22:58.091 --> 23:00.093
I always told you I'd get better.

23:00.125 --> 23:01.560
You just never believed me.

23:03.095 --> 23:05.097
Sure I did.

23:06.498 --> 23:11.371
But, Chuck this is great!

23:13.472 --> 23:15.274
How did you do it?

23:15.307 --> 23:17.176
What was it you wanted?

23:17.209 --> 23:19.045
Beyond "proof of life"?

23:20.545 --> 23:24.316
Oh.

23:24.350 --> 23:27.587
S-Something happened,

23:27.620 --> 23:30.156
and it made me think about what ha...

23:30.189 --> 23:32.225
went down between you and me.

23:32.257 --> 23:34.727
And...

23:34.760 --> 23:37.196
I wanted to say, in hindsight,

23:37.229 --> 23:40.132
I could've made different choices.

23:40.166 --> 23:42.268
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

23:42.301 --> 23:45.038
I mean, I'm not saying it's all on me.

23:45.071 --> 23:46.305
It's not.

23:46.339 --> 23:49.342
But if I had to do it all over again

23:49.374 --> 23:54.213
I would maybe
do some things differently.

23:54.247 --> 23:57.417
And I just thought you should know that.

23:57.449 --> 24:00.219
That you have regrets?

24:00.253 --> 24:02.522
Yeah. I have regrets.

24:02.554 --> 24:05.391
Mm.

24:05.425 --> 24:07.160
Why?

24:10.329 --> 24:12.799
'Cause you're my brother.

24:12.832 --> 24:16.436
There aren't that many
of us McGills left,

24:16.468 --> 24:19.471
and, uh, I think we
should stick together.

24:19.505 --> 24:22.108
No. Why have regrets at all?

24:22.141 --> 24:24.811
What's the point?

24:24.843 --> 24:26.312
What do you mean?

24:26.344 --> 24:29.181
Well, look at you.
You're in so much pain.

24:29.215 --> 24:32.118
Why are you putting
yourself through all this?

24:32.150 --> 24:34.187
'Cause I wanted to tell you...

24:34.219 --> 24:35.354
That you have regrets.

24:35.388 --> 24:37.457
don't bother.

24:37.489 --> 24:40.325
What's the point?

24:40.359 --> 24:42.095
You're just gonna keep hurting people.

24:42.128 --> 24:45.131
- That's not true.
- Jimmy, this is what you do.

24:45.163 --> 24:48.500
You hurt people. Over and over and over.

24:48.534 --> 24:50.737
And then there's this show of remorse...

24:50.769 --> 24:51.837
It's not a "show"!

24:51.871 --> 24:53.640
I know you don't think it's a show.

24:53.672 --> 24:55.641
I don't doubt your emotions are real,

24:55.675 --> 24:58.244
but what's the point
of all the sad faces

24:58.276 --> 24:59.679
and the gnashing of teeth?

24:59.711 --> 25:01.580
If you're not going to
change your behavior...

25:01.613 --> 25:03.415
and you won't...

25:03.449 --> 25:07.320
- I can change.
- why not just skip the whole exercise?

25:07.352 --> 25:11.356
In the end, you're going to
hurt everyone around you.

25:11.390 --> 25:12.725
You can't help it.

25:12.757 --> 25:15.627
So, stop apologizing and accept it.

25:15.660 --> 25:17.263
Embrace it.

25:17.295 --> 25:20.400
Frankly, I'd have more
respect for you if you did.

25:20.432 --> 25:23.202
- What about you, Chuck?
- Hmm?

25:23.236 --> 25:25.371
You didn't do anything wrong?

25:25.403 --> 25:27.606
You're just an innocent victim?

25:27.640 --> 25:30.543
Let me put your mind at ease, Jimmy.

25:30.575 --> 25:33.479
You don't have to make up with me.

25:33.513 --> 25:36.716
We don't have to understand each other.

25:36.748 --> 25:39.852
Things are fine the way they are.

25:41.687 --> 25:43.189
Hey.

25:46.659 --> 25:49.896
I don't want to hurt your feelings...

25:49.929 --> 25:54.700
but the truth is you've never
mattered all that much to me.

27:25.757 --> 27:27.559
Gold comforter.

27:27.593 --> 27:29.862
Green chair.

27:29.894 --> 27:31.363
Brown journal.

27:38.004 --> 27:39.606
Hm.

27:46.445 --> 27:47.581
Hm.

28:28.954 --> 28:30.390
Ah.

29:03.046 --> 29:05.582
Jimmy. What a nice surprise.

29:05.584 --> 29:08.053
Irene! As beautiful as ever!

29:08.086 --> 29:10.622
Why don't you come in?

29:10.655 --> 29:12.657
Can I get you some tea?

29:12.691 --> 29:14.492
Oh, I don't want to be a bother.

29:14.526 --> 29:16.595
I just have a couple things to drop off.

29:16.627 --> 29:19.030
Well, w-what is all this?

29:19.064 --> 29:23.302
Well, when we win, we celebrate.

29:23.335 --> 29:25.136
That's very sweet.

29:25.170 --> 29:27.339
Yes. And I didn't forget
about Oscar and Felix.

29:27.372 --> 29:29.441
I've got some kitty toys
and catnip in there

29:29.473 --> 29:31.042
for those two little rascals.

29:31.076 --> 29:33.245
Oh. You shouldn't have, Jimmy.

29:33.278 --> 29:35.581
Of course I should.

29:35.614 --> 29:37.383
Now, have you given any thought

29:37.415 --> 29:40.019
to how you want to spend
that settlement money?

29:42.154 --> 29:43.489
I don't know...

29:43.521 --> 29:46.058
Well, I'll tell you what I'd do.

29:46.090 --> 29:47.458
Alaskan cruise.

29:47.491 --> 29:51.763
You can walk on a glacier
under the Aurora Borealis.

29:55.133 --> 29:59.805
And if Alaska's too cold, maybe
a European river cruise.

29:59.837 --> 30:01.406
Float on down the Danube.

30:01.440 --> 30:04.243
I bet you and the ladies
could split a deluxe suite.

30:04.276 --> 30:06.445
Get into all sorts of trouble.

30:06.478 --> 30:08.147
That sounds very nice,

30:08.180 --> 30:11.717
but I don't think they'd really want to.

30:11.750 --> 30:14.685
Why not?

30:14.719 --> 30:19.357
They're still... upset.

30:19.391 --> 30:23.029
They <i> must</i> be excited about the
settlement though, right?

30:24.796 --> 30:27.732
But you can't let one
little misunderstanding

30:27.766 --> 30:30.569
destroy years of friendship.

30:30.601 --> 30:33.171
Oh, it's just
not the same, Jimmy.

30:33.204 --> 30:34.772
She showed her true colors.

30:34.806 --> 30:36.708
When it came to that settlement,

30:36.741 --> 30:39.243
we were the furthest
things from her mind.

30:39.277 --> 30:40.612
It just took her a bit

30:40.645 --> 30:43.214
to realize what was important to you.

30:43.248 --> 30:45.517
She came around.

30:45.549 --> 30:47.251
She just wanted

30:47.285 --> 30:50.389
to get back on our good side...

30:50.422 --> 30:53.225
Okay. How do you trust someone

30:53.258 --> 30:56.495
who bends any way the wind is blowing?

30:56.528 --> 30:58.630
Where is her integrity?

31:04.603 --> 31:07.406
Well, I can't help but blame myself.

31:07.439 --> 31:09.174
You were just trying to help.

31:09.206 --> 31:11.542
No. I stuck my nose in
where it didn't belong,

31:11.576 --> 31:14.179
and I stirred the pot.

31:14.212 --> 31:15.747
So...

31:17.315 --> 31:20.184
Look, if you want to blame someone,

31:20.218 --> 31:22.254
you should blame me.

31:23.687 --> 31:26.657
Jimmy, you're a good friend.

31:26.691 --> 31:28.293
She doesn't deserve you.

31:28.326 --> 31:30.596
No, she doesn't.

31:55.520 --> 31:59.290
Yes. I've... I've
shut off all the breakers.

31:59.324 --> 32:01.460
Yes, I have checked. Several times.

32:01.492 --> 32:03.561
The power meter is still turning.

32:03.595 --> 32:06.298
All I can think is that there's
something in the house

32:06.330 --> 32:08.433
that isn't wired through
the breaker box...

32:08.465 --> 32:10.702
and it's drawing power.

32:10.734 --> 32:12.803
Well, I-I want you to send someone over

32:12.837 --> 32:15.507
to find it and disconnect it.

32:15.539 --> 32:17.576
I...

32:17.608 --> 32:18.710
Wednesday?

32:18.742 --> 32:20.811
I can't wait that long.

32:20.845 --> 32:22.881
Are you sure there's nothing sooner?

32:26.218 --> 32:27.686
Wednesday then.

34:12.656 --> 34:14.960
Yes, hello? T-This is Charles McGill.

34:14.992 --> 34:17.762
I have a three o'clock with Dr.
Cruz today?

34:17.795 --> 34:20.799
Uh. Yes, well, w-would you tell her

34:20.831 --> 34:24.802
that something's come up and
I'm not able to come in today?

34:24.835 --> 34:28.406
No, no need to reschedule.
I'll just see her next week.

34:28.440 --> 34:29.841
Thank you.

34:29.873 --> 34:31.909
Ohh!

40:49.986 --> 40:52.622
Good.

40:52.654 --> 40:54.457
You got my message.

40:54.489 --> 40:55.959
Yeah.

40:55.991 --> 40:57.527
You strapped?

41:07.303 --> 41:09.239
They're coming.

41:45.341 --> 41:47.810
Don Hector.

41:47.843 --> 41:50.779
Don Eladio wanted me to speak
with you face to face,

41:50.812 --> 41:52.715
so there's no misunderstanding.

41:52.748 --> 41:57.286
From now on, there will be
only one route over the border

41:57.319 --> 42:00.856
for our product... the chicken trucks.

42:00.890 --> 42:02.625
That is final.

42:02.658 --> 42:05.794
But you must understand this
is for efficiency only...

42:05.828 --> 42:09.266
there's no disrespect
to you or your family.

42:10.667 --> 42:12.569
What's he doing here?

42:12.602 --> 42:14.870
The boss wants you to settle this.

42:16.339 --> 42:18.642
I settle it right now, okay?

42:18.674 --> 42:20.843
You have to work together.

42:20.877 --> 42:22.679
It's what the boss wants.

42:22.712 --> 42:25.849
The boss can suck me.

42:25.881 --> 42:27.517
I'd watch what I say if I were you.

42:27.549 --> 42:29.018
Who you think you are?

42:29.051 --> 42:32.454
You should be kissing my ass right now.

42:32.488 --> 42:34.690
Me and my family?

42:34.723 --> 42:37.026
We built this whole business.

42:37.060 --> 42:38.661
We all did. Together.

42:38.694 --> 42:41.363
No, no! Salamanca did!

42:41.397 --> 42:42.966
Salamanca money!

42:42.998 --> 42:44.767
Salamanca blood!

42:44.801 --> 42:45.902
You have to calm down.

42:45.935 --> 42:47.971
That hacienda! I paid for it.

42:48.004 --> 42:49.806
And you treat us like dogs!

42:49.839 --> 42:51.875
Hector, this isn't personal...

42:51.908 --> 42:54.743
It is! It is personal...!

43:12.361 --> 43:15.331
Call 911. Stash the guns.

43:16.899 --> 43:18.734
You should not be here when they arrive.

43:20.002 --> 43:22.839
Yeah. I need an ambulance.

43:22.872 --> 43:25.642
<i>iNo te mueras cabrón!</i>

43:25.674 --> 43:27.910
Outside a garage at the
corner of Aztec and Girard.

43:27.944 --> 43:30.547
My boss collapsed. I think
he's having a heart attack.

43:32.482 --> 43:34.451
<i>iNo te mueras cabrón!</i>

43:43.024 --> 43:44.593
Come on!

44:01.444 --> 44:04.047
Does he have a history
of cardiac issues?

44:04.080 --> 44:06.649
Yeah.

44:06.681 --> 44:08.651
And was he taking any medications?

44:08.683 --> 44:11.955
He took these.

44:11.988 --> 44:13.522
Thanks.

44:13.556 --> 44:15.825
We're headed to Lovelace,
if you'd like to follow.

44:38.681 --> 44:39.883
Hey.

44:39.915 --> 44:41.417
Hey.

44:45.339 --> 44:48.609
How's, uh, relax-o-thon
2003 comin' along?

44:48.642 --> 44:51.212
No complaints. Join me.

44:52.446 --> 44:54.615
Oh... dip... dip it in the sauce.

44:54.649 --> 44:56.088
Seems like overkill.

44:56.120 --> 44:58.256
Trust me.

45:00.024 --> 45:02.193
Mmm.

45:02.227 --> 45:03.429
So what's next?

45:03.461 --> 45:05.764
Uh, Monty Python.

45:05.798 --> 45:07.198
Solid choice.

45:07.231 --> 45:10.401
Or... we could just watch "To
Kill a Mockingbird" again.

45:10.435 --> 45:12.872
- Again?
- Yeah, I watched it this morning.

45:12.905 --> 45:14.439
It was my favorite when I was a kid.

45:14.472 --> 45:16.040
I loved Atticus Finch.

45:16.073 --> 45:18.343
All the girls were in
love with Gregory Peck.

45:18.377 --> 45:21.180
No. I wasn't <i> in</i> love with him.

45:21.213 --> 45:24.216
Well, a little. But, no.
I wanted to <i> be</i> him.

45:24.249 --> 45:27.051
Fight the good fight. Change the world.

45:27.084 --> 45:30.555
Yeah. Didn't you?

45:30.589 --> 45:35.194
That was more Chuck's thing.

45:35.227 --> 45:38.097
But, I mean, the good
news is you made it!

45:38.129 --> 45:39.564
Oh, yeah. yeah. I am.

45:39.597 --> 45:43.067
I'm changing the world by
helping a mid-size local bank

45:43.100 --> 45:45.104
become a mid-size regional bank.

45:45.136 --> 45:46.772
Yay me.

45:50.142 --> 45:53.212
So... no luck with Ms. Landry?

45:53.245 --> 45:56.248
No. Shoot. That bridge is burned.

45:56.281 --> 45:57.249
Ashes.

45:57.281 --> 45:58.984
It's that bad?

45:59.017 --> 46:01.486
T-There's no putting that
genie back in the bottle.

46:01.519 --> 46:03.555
And I've tried everything.

46:03.589 --> 46:05.958
I sent muffin baskets to the gals.

46:05.990 --> 46:07.959
- I signed them from her.
- Nice.

46:07.993 --> 46:09.461
They saw right through it.

46:09.493 --> 46:11.129
"Oh, Jimmy, you're too nice.

46:11.162 --> 46:12.964
Jimmy, she doesn't deserve you."

46:12.997 --> 46:15.166
The more I try to make
them like her again,

46:15.200 --> 46:18.604
the more they end up lovin' me instead.

46:18.636 --> 46:22.073
Wow. Well... sounds like you've
exhausted all your options...

46:22.106 --> 46:24.275
I mean, if muffin baskets
don't solve it...

46:24.309 --> 46:26.011
I don't know what else to do.

46:26.044 --> 46:28.480
I'm not good at building shit, you know?

46:28.513 --> 46:30.850
I'm excellent at tearing it down.

46:35.220 --> 46:37.555
Oh, rookie move.

46:37.589 --> 46:40.025
What... the...

46:40.057 --> 46:42.594
- It's already cheese.
- It's cheese on cheese.

46:42.627 --> 46:44.263
See?

46:44.296 --> 46:47.899
You know, sometimes, you got
to play to your strengths.

46:47.932 --> 46:50.201
You should stitch that on a pillow.

46:50.234 --> 46:52.503
Oh, I will. All right. Screw it.

46:52.537 --> 46:54.973
"Mockingbird" encore, it is.

47:00.646 --> 47:03.048
No.

47:03.080 --> 47:05.117
Oh, shit.

47:05.149 --> 47:06.352
What? What is it?

47:06.385 --> 47:10.222
Mrs. Landry.

47:10.254 --> 47:13.224
You figured it out.

47:13.258 --> 47:15.493
Yeah.

47:15.526 --> 47:18.396
But I really, really don't wanna do it.

47:27.039 --> 47:28.207
Hi.

47:30.676 --> 47:32.278
Hello! Hi there.

47:32.310 --> 47:33.479
- Jimmy!
- Jimmy.

47:33.511 --> 47:35.046
Jimmy.

47:35.080 --> 47:37.216
Okeydokey.

47:42.220 --> 47:44.256
Testing. Testing.

47:44.289 --> 47:46.591
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

47:46.624 --> 47:50.028
I know that many of you
were expecting Sandy

47:50.062 --> 47:52.698
for this morning's chair yoga,
but her daughter has a cold.

47:52.731 --> 47:54.499
But she'll be fine.

47:54.533 --> 47:57.970
Uh, the nice folks in front
said I could sit in.

47:58.002 --> 48:00.071
So, you guys ready to get to it?

48:00.104 --> 48:01.439
Yes.

48:01.472 --> 48:03.141
Okay.

48:03.175 --> 48:07.680
Let's wake up those spines
with, uh, cat/cow position.

48:07.713 --> 48:09.481
Very good.

48:09.513 --> 48:10.548
Cat...

48:12.617 --> 48:14.553
And then cow...

48:17.455 --> 48:19.724
Sit up straight. Very good, Jasper.

48:19.758 --> 48:22.227
Cat...

48:22.260 --> 48:24.629
And cow...

48:24.662 --> 48:26.397
Long, deep breaths.

48:26.430 --> 48:28.666
Breathe in through the nose
and out through the mouth.

48:31.102 --> 48:32.403
And cow...

48:35.106 --> 48:37.309
And cat...

48:39.343 --> 48:41.213
Mr. McGill.

48:41.245 --> 48:42.481
Erin Brill!

48:42.513 --> 48:45.050
You're just in time for chair yoga.

48:45.082 --> 48:48.619
I need to talk to you.

48:48.653 --> 48:50.189
Uh, well, pull up a chair.

48:50.222 --> 48:52.156
There's always room for one more.

48:52.189 --> 48:54.693
Now, Mr. McGill.

49:02.533 --> 49:04.736
- What?
- You are unbelievable.

49:04.769 --> 49:07.472
I could not, for the life of
me, figure out why on earth

49:07.506 --> 49:09.540
Mrs. Landry would
suddenly change her mind

49:09.573 --> 49:11.276
about the Sandpiper settlement.

49:11.309 --> 49:13.678
I had to practically drag
the information out of her

49:13.711 --> 49:15.213
that you filled her head

49:15.247 --> 49:17.015
and all of her friends' heads with lies.

49:17.048 --> 49:18.550
I never lied to anyone.

49:18.582 --> 49:22.453
You drastically misrepresented
the reality of the case.

49:22.486 --> 49:23.655
So?

49:23.687 --> 49:25.423
So?!

49:25.457 --> 49:27.792
You took advantage of poor Mrs. Landry.

49:27.825 --> 49:30.228
<i>Does she know how much money
you're gonna make from this?</i>

49:30.261 --> 49:33.464
<i>Nope. And again I ask... so what?</i>

49:33.497 --> 49:35.266
<i>These people trusted you, Jimmy.</i>

49:35.300 --> 49:38.336
<i>Do you have any idea how
much time I had to put in</i>

49:38.370 --> 49:42.040
<i>listening to their insipid
ramblings about their sciatica</i>

49:42.073 --> 49:44.443
<i>or which grandchild
disappoints them the most?</i>

49:44.475 --> 49:46.111
Damn right they trust me.

49:46.144 --> 49:48.546
I worked my ass off earning their trust.

49:48.580 --> 49:50.249
Then you betrayed it.

49:50.281 --> 49:52.818
If the only thing standing
between me and a million bucks

49:52.850 --> 49:54.252
is some old lady's tears,

49:54.285 --> 49:56.120
then I'd suggest investing in Kleenex.

49:56.153 --> 49:58.433
You've ruined her life because
you wanted your money faster.

49:58.457 --> 50:00.559
Boo and hoo.

50:00.591 --> 50:04.363
Besides, it's not like she's got
that much time left, anyway.

50:04.396 --> 50:06.198
You're disgusting.

50:06.231 --> 50:08.066
And rich.

50:12.336 --> 50:14.105
Hey, everyone. Apologies!

50:14.138 --> 50:17.309
That was probably more like
20 breaths instead of 10.

50:17.341 --> 50:18.776
Uh.

50:18.810 --> 50:22.281
I don't see a lot of forward folding...
going on.

50:35.760 --> 50:37.662
Come on, girls.

50:40.164 --> 50:41.699
Shame on you.

51:01.785 --> 51:04.490
So?

51:04.522 --> 51:05.691
Like a charm, yeah.

51:05.723 --> 51:07.658
She'll go back on the settlement?

51:07.691 --> 51:11.362
I imagine you'll hear from
her within an hour or so.

51:11.396 --> 51:13.765
- Good.
- Hey.

51:13.798 --> 51:15.466
Well done in there.

51:15.499 --> 51:18.870
I meant every word I said.

51:18.903 --> 51:22.306
I know.

51:22.339 --> 51:23.742
Thank you.

51:39.723 --> 51:41.827
- You got the address?
- Yep.

51:41.859 --> 51:43.603
Okay. I'll meet you guys
there in about an hour.

51:43.627 --> 51:45.396
- We'll unload.
- Sounds good.

51:52.236 --> 51:54.405
Hey. You guys about done?

51:54.439 --> 51:56.542
Yep.

51:56.575 --> 51:57.876
Listen, I, um...

51:57.908 --> 52:00.711
I'm real sorry that
this didn't work out.

52:00.745 --> 52:02.414
It's fine.

52:02.446 --> 52:04.550
I already talked to my old
supervisor at the MVD.

52:04.582 --> 52:06.584
Looks like they can take me back.

52:06.618 --> 52:07.786
- So...
- Oh.

52:07.818 --> 52:09.720
That's great. And, you know,

52:09.754 --> 52:14.193
if we ever get another office
up, you'd be our first call.

52:15.859 --> 52:18.664
Yeah. Okay.

52:18.696 --> 52:20.298
Good to know.

52:20.332 --> 52:22.201
Bye, Kim.

52:22.234 --> 52:23.636
Oh. Bye.

52:37.582 --> 52:39.585
She understands.

52:42.019 --> 52:45.990
So, uh, what's left?

52:46.024 --> 52:48.359
I think this is it. This
is all admin stuff.

52:48.392 --> 52:51.229
Uh, appointment book. Your Rolodex.

52:54.832 --> 52:57.602
Hey, why'd you do that?

52:57.635 --> 53:01.239
Because no senior's coming
within 20 feet of me ever again.

53:01.272 --> 53:03.742
I'm gonna need a whole
new business model

53:03.774 --> 53:05.477
when I get my license back.

53:05.510 --> 53:06.944
Kim. It's pointless.

53:06.977 --> 53:10.749
They're smearing my name
across the tri-state area.

53:10.781 --> 53:13.618
Sendin' telegrams to
everyone far and near.

53:13.651 --> 53:15.521
You never know.

53:24.396 --> 53:26.531
It's a good wall.

53:28.399 --> 53:29.600
You think?

53:29.633 --> 53:30.935
Yeah.

53:33.705 --> 53:35.341
We'll get another.

53:36.908 --> 53:38.978
A better wall.

53:42.414 --> 53:43.549
Ready?

53:45.984 --> 53:47.686
Let's go home.
