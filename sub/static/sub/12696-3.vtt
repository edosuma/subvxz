WEBVTT

00:10.600 --> 00:13.633
I've got thunder hunger.

00:13.733 --> 00:14.967
Ooh, oatmeal.

00:15.067 --> 00:17.000
- Uh, no, Max,
that's not--

00:20.567 --> 00:23.900
- Walnuts that Chloe
chewed up and spit out.

00:25.133 --> 00:28.800
- Because it's fun.

00:28.900 --> 00:31.733
- Just for that,
I'm taking your toast.

00:36.733 --> 00:39.000
Not cool, dude.

00:39.100 --> 00:42.000
- Ha, ha, ha.

00:42.100 --> 00:45.500
That is another good sports
joke and/or reference.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.867
- I'm practicing
my "sports guy" talk.

00:48.967 --> 00:51.067
Link is coming by with his best
friend Quinn from Metroburg,

00:51.167 --> 00:52.967
and I really wanna
make a good impression.

00:53.067 --> 00:54.933
- Ah, I'm sure you've got
nothin' to worry about.

00:55.033 --> 00:56.833
- Aw, thanks.
- Anyone who likes Link

00:56.933 --> 00:58.767
has very low standards
in friends.

00:58.867 --> 01:00.800
- Chloe!

01:00.900 --> 01:02.733
- Ow!

01:02.833 --> 01:04.433
- Thank you!

01:04.533 --> 01:05.733
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Alert! Alert!

01:05.833 --> 01:09.767
Link and Quinn approaching.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.067
- Phoebe, this is
my friend Quinn.

01:15.167 --> 01:16.967
- Uh...

01:17.067 --> 01:18.900
- Quinn's a girl.

01:19.067 --> 01:21.900
- Yes, I see that.

01:22.067 --> 01:23.633
- *

01:23.733 --> 01:24.867
* What you see

01:24.967 --> 01:26.467
* Is not what you get

01:26.567 --> 01:29.800
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

01:29.900 --> 01:31.233
* We fit right in

01:31.333 --> 01:33.067
* Bet you never guessed

01:33.100 --> 01:34.400
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

01:34.500 --> 01:36.233
* Just like all the rest

01:36.333 --> 01:38.233
* A picture
perfect family *

01:38.333 --> 01:39.967
* Is what we try to be

01:40.067 --> 01:41.233
* Look closer,
you might see *

01:41.333 --> 01:43.233
* The crazy things we do

01:43.333 --> 01:44.833
* This isn't
make believe *

01:44.933 --> 01:46.267
* It's our reality

01:46.367 --> 01:47.700
* Just your average family

01:47.800 --> 01:51.067
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

01:51.100 --> 01:53.800
* Livin' a double life

01:58.367 --> 02:00.767
- Quinn, it's so nice
to finally meet you.

02:00.867 --> 02:03.967
Can I get you anything
to girl

02:04.067 --> 02:05.700
- No, I'm fine.

02:05.800 --> 02:08.400
- Yes, you are.

02:08.500 --> 02:10.667
I'm Max.

02:10.767 --> 02:12.233
- Uh, sorry we're late.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.100
Quinn made us help a family
of ducks cross the road.

02:14.200 --> 02:17.600
- And I'm out.

02:17.700 --> 02:20.400
- It's so cool to meet
your friends, Linky.

02:20.500 --> 02:21.600
- Aw...

02:21.700 --> 02:23.900
I'm sorry, did you
just call him "Linky"?

02:24.067 --> 02:25.600
- Oh, that's Quinn's
nickname for me.

02:25.700 --> 02:27.133
- It's not as good
as your nickname

02:27.233 --> 02:28.933
for me when we were kids.

02:29.067 --> 02:31.633
- BOTH: Quinny-boo-bear!

02:31.733 --> 02:34.067
- What about that cute
nickname you have for me?

02:34.167 --> 02:36.200
- I call you "Phoebe."

02:36.300 --> 02:39.067
- Stop, I'm blushing.

02:39.167 --> 02:41.067
- Excuse me, I have
to call my aunt

02:41.133 --> 02:43.700
and let her know
I got here safely.

02:46.700 --> 02:47.967
- So...

02:51.267 --> 02:52.767
Ta-da!

02:52.867 --> 02:55.267
- You and I have our six month
anniversary this week.

02:55.367 --> 02:59.133
- Oh, and you have
a best friend who's a girl!

02:59.233 --> 03:00.800
- You know, it's funny.

03:00.900 --> 03:02.933
I never quite think
of Quinn as a girl.

03:03.067 --> 03:04.300
We became best friends

03:04.400 --> 03:06.300
because we were both nice kids
raised by supervillains.

03:06.400 --> 03:09.600
Our parents called themselves
"The Frightening Four."

03:09.700 --> 03:12.367
- Wait a minute, her parents
are Insecto and Beetle Girl?

03:12.467 --> 03:15.333
- Well, yes, but I call
them Mr. and Mrs. Murphy.

03:15.433 --> 03:17.133
- They were the bug freaks

03:17.233 --> 03:19.067
who attacked the Metroburg
Mango Festival.

03:19.133 --> 03:20.667
- Yeah, they go crazy
around mangoes.

03:20.767 --> 03:22.533
But, luckily, your dad
thought fast

03:22.633 --> 03:24.400
and hosed 'em down
with some hot sauce.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.167
- Well, good thing Thunderman

03:26.267 --> 03:28.100
never goes anywhere
without a tank of hot sauce.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.933
- Off to check the mail!

03:31.667 --> 03:34.167
- Well, anyway, Quinn's
not like her parents at all.

03:34.267 --> 03:36.667
No bug powers
and as nice as can be.

03:36.767 --> 03:38.133
- Yeah, she seems great.

03:38.233 --> 03:39.967
- See, that's why
I like you so much.

03:40.067 --> 03:41.400
Not a jealous bone
in your body.

03:41.500 --> 03:44.067
- Not me. All my bones
are perfectly cool.

03:44.100 --> 03:45.900
Ha! That should
be my new nickname--

03:46.067 --> 03:47.633
Coolbones!

03:50.200 --> 03:52.600
- Oh, my goodness.
I am so sorry.

03:52.700 --> 03:53.867
Link, could you
get me a broom?

03:53.967 --> 03:56.733
- It's okay. It's just
a silly little birdhouse.

03:56.833 --> 03:58.400
Let me help you.
- Thanks.

03:58.500 --> 03:59.600
Oh, and by the way...

03:59.700 --> 04:01.800
this birdhouse isn't
the only thing

04:01.900 --> 04:04.167
I'll be breaking
apart while I'm here.

04:06.267 --> 04:07.800
- Link and I
belong together...

04:07.900 --> 04:11.133
and the only thing
in our way is you.

04:14.367 --> 04:16.100
- I've got the broom.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.067
- Oh, Phoebe says
she'll finish up.

04:18.133 --> 04:19.733
Uh, we have to
go, Linky.

04:19.833 --> 04:21.767
My aunt is waiting for me.
- Oh, okay.

04:21.867 --> 04:23.333
Uh, Phoebe, come with us

04:23.433 --> 04:25.167
to Scrunchies' for
ice cream tomorrow?

04:25.267 --> 04:27.067
- Yeah, Phoebe, come with.

04:29.333 --> 04:31.267
- Great. Great.

04:31.367 --> 04:33.600
See ya then, Coolbones.

04:36.833 --> 04:41.633
- *

04:41.733 --> 04:45.267
- Billy, Nora, do you know
why we asked you up here?

04:45.367 --> 04:49.200
- I admit it!
I drank Mom's shampoo!

04:49.300 --> 04:51.867
It just looked so
green and refreshing.

04:51.967 --> 04:54.567
- It's true. You've
gotta see the video.

04:54.667 --> 04:56.300
- Okay, we'll talk
about that later.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.100
But, first,
we wanna thank you

04:58.200 --> 04:59.800
for being so great
about sharing a room

04:59.900 --> 05:02.500
ever since we put Chloe
in Billy's old room.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.267
- And as a reward,
we worked all day

05:04.367 --> 05:07.567
and redesigned your room.

05:08.867 --> 05:11.367
- NORA: No way!
- BILLY: Whoa!

05:11.467 --> 05:13.233
- This is the coolest
room ever!

05:13.333 --> 05:15.900
- I call the bed
that says "Billy"!

05:17.600 --> 05:19.400
- We're glad you like it.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.467
Come on, Chloe,
it's time for your nap.

05:21.567 --> 05:23.533
- I wanna nap here.

05:23.633 --> 05:25.133
- Don't you wanna nap
in your room?

05:25.233 --> 05:26.933
- There's a monster.

05:27.067 --> 05:29.433
Sweetie?

05:29.533 --> 05:33.800
- Dad, let us handle
this--kid-to-kid.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.667
- Chloe, we used to
be in your shoes.

05:36.767 --> 05:39.800
Seriously, those used
to be my shoes.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.167
But take it from us,

05:41.267 --> 05:43.367
there's no such
thing as monsters.

05:43.467 --> 05:45.400
- Never has been.
- Never will be.

05:45.500 --> 05:48.100
- Except the huggy monster!

05:54.967 --> 05:57.067
- Billy drank shampoo!

05:58.633 --> 06:02.067
- Is it something you
can use as a weapon?

06:02.100 --> 06:03.900
- No.

06:04.067 --> 06:07.500
'Cause I once crippled
a guy with an onion ring.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.467
- Max, I need
to talk to you.

06:09.567 --> 06:11.833
- Quick, get me
an onion ring!

06:11.933 --> 06:13.367
- Remember Link's
friend Quinn?

06:13.467 --> 06:15.433
It turns out she's some
sort of crazy mean girl.

06:15.533 --> 06:17.167
She totally hates me.

06:17.267 --> 06:19.333
- Still waitin'
on the crazy part.

06:19.433 --> 06:21.067
- I'm serious, Max.

06:21.133 --> 06:23.233
She even threatened
to break up me and Link.

06:23.333 --> 06:25.267
She made a heart
with her hands,

06:25.367 --> 06:27.100
and then went like this...

06:28.800 --> 06:30.567
Look, Phoebe,
even if it's true,

06:30.667 --> 06:32.433
why are you telling me?
Tell Link.

06:32.533 --> 06:34.267
- That's the problem.
I can't.

06:34.367 --> 06:36.333
He'll just think I'm
a jealous girlfriend.

06:36.433 --> 06:39.833
And that's not how
Coolbones rolls.

06:39.933 --> 06:42.933
- Seriously, get me
an onion ring!

06:43.067 --> 06:45.300
- But if he sees her
being mean to me again,

06:45.400 --> 06:46.700
he'll know she's bad news.

06:46.800 --> 06:47.900
And since you're
always mean to me,

06:48.067 --> 06:50.933
I thought you could help
get the ball rolling.

06:51.067 --> 06:53.100
- Look, Phoebe, I'd love
to help you, but...

06:55.067 --> 06:58.067
I'm just kidding.
I'd hate to help you.

06:58.100 --> 07:00.233
- So, you'd rather
glue cards to your head

07:00.333 --> 07:01.967
than help your sister?

07:02.067 --> 07:03.733
Thanks a lot.

07:03.833 --> 07:06.333
- Finally!
Now, back to the game.

07:06.433 --> 07:07.800
- He's a horse
and you're a pineapple.

07:07.900 --> 07:09.933
- MAX: Oh, come on!
- COLOSSO: Hater!

07:10.067 --> 07:16.233
- *

07:25.233 --> 07:27.067
Nora!

07:27.100 --> 07:29.600
Look, free bows!

07:30.767 --> 07:32.600
- I think there's
a monster under my bed.

07:32.700 --> 07:36.267
- First of all--
never joke about bows!

07:36.367 --> 07:38.167
Second of all--
don't be ridiculous.

07:38.267 --> 07:39.567
- I'm serious.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.533
I heard a really
weird noise.

07:41.633 --> 07:46.533
- Me, too, and it
won't stop talking to me.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.267
I'm scared.

07:49.367 --> 07:51.800
Come on.

07:51.900 --> 07:54.067
We'll check under
your bed together.

07:54.133 --> 07:55.400
- Thank you.

07:55.500 --> 08:00.067
- One, two, three.

08:00.133 --> 08:03.067
You see? Nothing.

08:06.333 --> 08:09.433
- BOTH: Monster!

08:11.067 --> 08:13.400
Hot sauce monster!

08:13.500 --> 08:15.200
- It is the middle
of the night.

08:15.300 --> 08:17.200
What are you two doing?

08:17.300 --> 08:18.567
- Trying to survive!

08:18.667 --> 08:20.667
- There's a monster
under my bed.

08:20.767 --> 08:22.633
- Nice try, you two.

08:22.733 --> 08:24.667
I heard you telling Chloe
you don't believe in monsters.

08:24.767 --> 08:26.933
You're just staying up late,
goofing off.

08:27.067 --> 08:28.867
Now go back to bed.
- BOTH: But, Dad, there's--

08:28.967 --> 08:33.300
- * La La La La La La
Goodnight.

08:39.833 --> 08:42.067
- Are we gonna
sleep here tonight?

08:42.133 --> 08:44.400
- This is our dream
bedroom, Billy.

08:44.500 --> 08:45.667
What do you think?

08:45.767 --> 08:48.400
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

08:48.500 --> 08:53.433
- *

08:53.533 --> 08:55.300
- Hey, Max,
thanks for coming.

08:55.400 --> 08:56.867
- I'm not here for you.

08:56.967 --> 08:58.433
I just have
an inexplicable craving

08:58.533 --> 09:00.200
for Rocky Road ice cream.

09:00.300 --> 09:02.200
- Ah, weird.

09:09.367 --> 09:11.367
- Eat fire, cyborg scum!

09:11.467 --> 09:14.067
- Pound 'im in
the abdomen!

09:15.700 --> 09:19.067
Ice cream...

09:19.100 --> 09:23.533
- Wait a minute, did you--
- Shhhh, here they come.

09:23.633 --> 09:25.067
Look at her hiding
in the back field

09:25.133 --> 09:27.200
trying to intercept
my boyfriend.

09:27.300 --> 09:31.100
- Oh, nice football analogy.
- I hate that I know that.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.500
All right, here's the deal--
I'll buy you three scoops,

09:33.600 --> 09:35.833
if you can get Quinn to be mean
to me again in front of Link.

09:35.933 --> 09:38.200
- Phoebe, there's no way.
The woman's hug-a-duck is--

09:45.067 --> 09:47.333
I think I'm in love.

09:47.433 --> 09:49.600
- I told you she was bad.
- Well, she's not only bad...

09:49.700 --> 09:51.300
she's heartless...

09:51.400 --> 09:52.633
and callous...

09:52.733 --> 09:55.300
and she will be mine.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.367
- That could work.

09:57.467 --> 09:58.633
If you can get Quinn
to fall for you,

09:58.733 --> 10:00.033
she'll forget about Link.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.500
Okay, here's what
you need to do--

10:01.600 --> 10:04.200
Wait, where'd ya go?

10:04.300 --> 10:05.367
- Hey, guys.

10:05.467 --> 10:07.733
- Oh, hi, Max.
I didn't know you were coming.

10:07.833 --> 10:08.967
- Uh, I invited him.

10:09.067 --> 10:12.000
You know much he loves--
- Your eyes.

10:12.100 --> 10:13.567
- I was gonna say
"ice cream," but...

10:13.667 --> 10:15.433
creepy works, too.

10:15.533 --> 10:17.300
- So, Quinn, how long
are you in town?

10:17.400 --> 10:19.000
Maybe I can show
you around?

10:19.100 --> 10:20.967
- No, thanks, I don't get
to see Linky very much,

10:21.067 --> 10:23.733
so, I was planning to spend
all my time with him.

10:23.833 --> 10:26.300
- Uh, actually,
me and Sir Links-a-Lot,

10:26.400 --> 10:29.567
new nickname, are having our
sixth month anniversary dinner

10:29.667 --> 10:32.533
tomorrow night,
so you guys are free.

10:32.633 --> 10:35.233
- I see. Then I'd love
to see you, Max.

10:35.333 --> 10:38.133
We'll make it a double
date with Phoebe and Link.

10:39.767 --> 10:41.733
- Oh, you won't be jealous
if we tag along.

10:41.833 --> 10:44.267
Will you, Dogbones?

10:44.367 --> 10:46.200
- It's Coolbones.

10:46.300 --> 10:48.900
And I'm cool with it.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.800
- Uh, well, if you are,
then I am.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.600
Now what's everyone having.

10:52.700 --> 10:54.567
- I'm just gonna get
a small cone.

10:54.667 --> 10:56.367
- I'm buying!

10:56.467 --> 10:58.367
- With hundred
dollar gift card.

10:58.467 --> 11:00.867
- Give it up, honey!
Link is mine!

11:00.967 --> 11:04.400
So back off or else...

11:04.500 --> 11:05.833
Cute shoes!

11:05.933 --> 11:10.367
- I do not accept
your compliment.

11:10.467 --> 11:13.300
- Would you like to sample
our mango frozen yogurt?

11:13.400 --> 11:15.167
- Mango!!

11:35.067 --> 11:38.867
- *

11:40.267 --> 11:43.100
- All right, another
monster-free night.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.900
Billy, wake up.

11:45.067 --> 11:49.600
Eat Nora first!

11:49.700 --> 11:51.867
This is awkward.

11:51.967 --> 11:53.700
- Get up--we have
clean this mess

11:53.800 --> 11:55.967
before Mom and Dad
come downstairs.

11:56.067 --> 11:57.233
- On it.

12:03.500 --> 12:06.533
Can you move? I'm trying
to hide stuff from you.

12:06.633 --> 12:09.433
Did you guys sleep
down here last night?

12:09.533 --> 12:10.700
- No.

12:10.800 --> 12:13.067
- The last two nights.

12:13.167 --> 12:14.700
Why?

12:14.800 --> 12:16.200
What's that on
your arm, Billy?

12:16.300 --> 12:18.767
- It's a recipe
for the monster.

12:18.867 --> 12:21.067
- "How To Make
a Nora Casserole."

12:21.100 --> 12:23.067
- Billy!

12:23.133 --> 12:25.900
- Maybe you two sharing
a room was a mistake.

12:26.067 --> 12:27.900
Now you're sneaking down here
in the middle of the night

12:28.067 --> 12:29.700
and making stuff up?

12:29.800 --> 12:31.667
- We're not making
anything up.

12:31.767 --> 12:33.500
There really is a monster.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.600
Told ya.

12:37.400 --> 12:38.900
- Okay, this has to stop.

12:39.067 --> 12:40.833
No more monster talk,
or we're gonna separate you guys

12:40.933 --> 12:42.800
and have Billy sleep
in the attic.

12:44.967 --> 12:47.067
No!
Are you even listening?

12:47.133 --> 12:49.267
- You're right, Mom.
We promise.

12:49.367 --> 12:51.533
No more monster talk.

12:53.233 --> 12:55.367
So, let's talk
about the monster.

12:55.467 --> 12:57.833
Obviously, we need
to handle this on our own.

12:57.933 --> 12:59.600
And there's only
one solution.

12:59.700 --> 13:02.300
- Move out west
and live off the land?

13:02.400 --> 13:05.833
- No, we catch that monster
and take back our room.

13:05.933 --> 13:08.500
- Right! Then move!

13:08.600 --> 13:14.200
- *

13:14.300 --> 13:17.067
- Oh, this place is lovely.

13:17.167 --> 13:19.667
- Only the best
for you, Quinn.

13:19.767 --> 13:20.967
Remember when you paid
at Scrunchies'?

13:21.067 --> 13:23.133
That's our thing now.

13:23.233 --> 13:25.433
- I'm gonna check on a little
anniversary surprise

13:25.533 --> 13:27.867
I set up for us.
- Aw...

13:27.967 --> 13:30.700
- Which is less of
a surprise now.

13:33.567 --> 13:35.067
I have the best boyfriend.

13:35.133 --> 13:36.967
- Yeah, and to think
the cab driver thought

13:37.067 --> 13:39.300
Link and I were a couple.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.200
Well, you were sittin'
on his lap.

13:42.300 --> 13:44.533
- I was just giving you
room to fix your makeup.

13:44.633 --> 13:46.067
But you're fine.

13:46.133 --> 13:47.967
The lighting in here
is very forgiving.

13:50.833 --> 13:53.533
What'd I miss?

13:53.633 --> 13:56.067
- Not much.

13:56.133 --> 13:59.067
- Come on,
our table's ready.

13:59.100 --> 14:01.067
- Remember the plan,
Max, okay?

14:01.167 --> 14:03.267
Make Quinn fall for you, so
she'll lose interest in Link.

14:03.367 --> 14:05.100
- You keep talking like
we're in this together.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.667
- I'm just trying to
make her fall for me

14:06.767 --> 14:09.367
so she loses
interest in Link.

14:09.467 --> 14:12.467
Now, time to put on
the flirt face.

14:12.567 --> 14:16.600
Step aside, 'cause this
might get beautiful.

14:16.700 --> 14:18.767
I call this one...

14:18.867 --> 14:20.500
The Velvet Tiger!

14:24.767 --> 14:26.500
- You sure that's
not the, uh,

14:26.600 --> 14:28.367
constipated kitten?

14:32.967 --> 14:34.967
- My, it is so
humid out here.

14:35.067 --> 14:36.900
It's a good thing
I brought my pocket fan.

14:37.067 --> 14:38.933
Uh, Linky, a little help?

14:39.067 --> 14:40.700
- All right.

14:40.800 --> 14:46.400
- *

14:46.500 --> 14:47.900
- Okay, wrap it up.

14:48.067 --> 14:49.567
It's a dinner,
not a photo shoot.

14:49.667 --> 14:51.467
- That's it, keep going.

14:51.567 --> 14:53.500
Give me the eyebrows.
Look at the camera.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.133
Love ya. Oh, nice.

14:55.233 --> 14:57.100
- MAX: Oh!

15:03.833 --> 15:05.567
- Uh, how do I turn
this fan off?

15:05.667 --> 15:07.833
- Oh, it's easy. Watch.

15:07.933 --> 15:10.433
- PHOEBE: Oh!

15:12.333 --> 15:13.800
- Oops!

15:13.900 --> 15:15.967
- Uh, did that mess
up my hair?

15:20.300 --> 15:22.933
- So, Quinn, I'm really
liking your mean streak.

15:23.067 --> 15:25.367
I admittedly have a bit
of one, myself.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.800
- I have no idea
what you're talking about.

15:27.900 --> 15:30.200
- Our little secret.
Got it.

15:30.300 --> 15:33.767
- Good evening. I'm Rob.
I'll be your waiter tonight.

15:33.867 --> 15:35.933
- Hey, Robbie, why don't you
tell us about the specials?

15:36.067 --> 15:37.567
- I'd be happy to.

15:37.667 --> 15:39.933
Our fish tonight is a tuna
tartare with a--

15:43.767 --> 15:46.733
- Uh, it's tuna tartare with--

15:52.300 --> 15:56.533
I'm sorry. Would you
please excuse me?

15:59.700 --> 16:03.067
I should get out
more often.

16:03.100 --> 16:04.833
- You should.

16:04.933 --> 16:07.467
In fact, why don't you go
on another date with Quinn?

16:07.567 --> 16:08.867
Somewhere else.

16:08.967 --> 16:10.933
Right now.

16:14.067 --> 16:16.233
- Ew.

16:16.333 --> 16:17.800
- Uh, hey, everybody,
how about we toast

16:17.900 --> 16:20.267
to Phoebe's
and my anniversary?

16:20.367 --> 16:23.800
Max, could you pass
the water?

16:31.067 --> 16:33.467
- Oh, Phoebe, that's too bad.

16:33.567 --> 16:35.700
At least it wasn't one
of your nice dresses.

16:35.800 --> 16:40.233
- *

16:40.333 --> 16:41.800
- Okay, let's
review the plan.

16:41.900 --> 16:44.700
The monster will enter
the room--attracted by our bait.

16:44.800 --> 16:49.433
- Pork sausages and a copy of
"Monster Fashion" magazine.

16:49.533 --> 16:52.500
- When he trips the trap,
whoosh, the net falls on him.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.400
- Then you zap
the daylights out of him.

16:54.500 --> 16:57.367
- Exactly.
- But don't zap the magazine.

16:57.467 --> 16:59.567
I still wanna see what those
sassy Sasquatches

16:59.667 --> 17:01.533
are wearing this Fall.

17:01.633 --> 17:03.400
Let's do this!

17:14.967 --> 17:16.867
- Uh-huh!

17:19.067 --> 17:21.467
- We've got him, Nora.

17:21.567 --> 17:22.867
Now blast him
into next week.

17:25.100 --> 17:27.867
- Hi.

17:27.967 --> 17:30.100
- Is that the sound
your doll makes?

17:32.733 --> 17:34.200
- Chloe's the monster!

17:34.300 --> 17:36.267
Blast her, Nora!

17:36.367 --> 17:38.533
- Chloe's not a monster.

17:38.633 --> 17:40.967
Chloe, what are you
doing in here?

17:41.067 --> 17:43.600
- My room's scary.

17:43.700 --> 17:45.333
- Oh, I get it.

17:45.433 --> 17:47.200
She's been teleporting
under our beds at night

17:47.300 --> 17:49.733
because she's afraid to
sleep in her own room.

17:51.067 --> 17:52.667
Are you afraid to
sleep by yourself?

17:52.767 --> 17:54.233
- Uh-huh.

17:54.333 --> 17:55.967
- Aw, that's so cute.

17:56.067 --> 17:58.333
Nora, take a shot!

18:00.833 --> 18:03.200
- Sweetie, do you wanna sleep
in Mommy and Daddy's room

18:03.300 --> 18:05.633
for a little while longer?
- Mm-hm.

18:05.733 --> 18:08.067
- Well, Billy, looks like you
have your old room back--

18:08.133 --> 18:09.500
for a little while.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.333
- But we love being roomies.

18:11.433 --> 18:14.067
- Yeah, Nora blasts
my toys in her sleep.

18:14.167 --> 18:17.233
- Yeah, in my sleep.

18:17.333 --> 18:19.733
- Look, Chloe, you can
come stay with us

18:19.833 --> 18:20.900
whenever you want.

18:21.067 --> 18:23.533
- Geez, why do we need
a five

18:23.633 --> 18:26.067
Why don't we all just
sleep in the same room?

18:26.100 --> 18:29.300
I was kidding!

18:36.300 --> 18:39.067
- Hey, Quinn, what're
you doing in my chair?

18:39.167 --> 18:40.500
- It's just so much
more festive

18:40.600 --> 18:42.133
when people switch
seats during dinner,

18:42.233 --> 18:43.800
don't you think?

18:43.900 --> 18:46.200
I do!

18:46.300 --> 18:49.733
Which is why I think we
should switch seats again.

18:51.400 --> 18:54.600
Look at us being festive.

18:54.700 --> 18:57.600
- Listen to me, wondergirl,
I warned you.

18:57.700 --> 19:00.167
Nothing can stop me
from being with Link.

19:00.267 --> 19:01.733
- I'm not afraid of you.

19:01.833 --> 19:02.900
- You should be.

19:03.067 --> 19:06.600
I can be very scary.

19:08.267 --> 19:11.933
Oh, you are goin' down!

19:12.067 --> 19:13.333
Link, I didn't
wanna say anything

19:13.433 --> 19:14.933
'cause I was afraid you
would think I'm jealous,

19:15.067 --> 19:17.167
but Quinn has been trying to
steal you away from me.

19:17.267 --> 19:18.467
Oh, and, status update--

19:18.567 --> 19:21.733
she's an evil bug villain
just like her parents!

19:24.167 --> 19:26.500
Run away with me!

19:26.600 --> 19:29.700
- Phoebe, why would you
say such hurtful things?

19:29.800 --> 19:33.233
- Oh, quiet, six-legs!

19:33.333 --> 19:36.300
- Surprise crab cocktail
for the anniversary couple!

19:36.400 --> 19:38.133
- Oh, not a good time.

19:38.233 --> 19:41.433
- I'll take that.
Tiger's gotta eat.

19:41.533 --> 19:44.300
- Phoebe, maybe your group
anniversary date was a bad idea.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.867
- It wasn't my idea,
it was hers--

19:46.967 --> 19:50.067
Quinny Bug-Bug!

19:50.167 --> 19:52.967
- Maybe I should just
take Quinn home.

19:55.333 --> 19:58.233
- Two mango salads.

19:58.333 --> 20:01.000
- Excuse me a sec.

20:03.767 --> 20:06.233
- Trade ya half-eaten crab legs
for a mango salad.

20:06.333 --> 20:08.000
Thank you.

20:08.100 --> 20:09.967
I was digging those crab legs.

20:10.067 --> 20:11.400
- It's mango salad, Max.

20:11.500 --> 20:15.000
If I'm right, Quinn can't
resist the smell of mangoes.

20:17.433 --> 20:22.500
Then the Velvet Tiger
has just found his scent.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.367
- Listen, Quinn wants to go

20:24.467 --> 20:26.400
and you're just not being
quite yourself tonight.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.267
- Aw, but you can't
leave yet.

20:28.367 --> 20:31.233
Quinn hasn't even
had her dinner.

20:41.467 --> 20:42.600
- Oh! Oh! I know!

20:42.700 --> 20:44.567
Uh, see, this is
the moment where you realize

20:44.667 --> 20:47.500
your girlfriend was right about
your friend being a bug villain!

20:54.300 --> 20:56.300
- Uh...guys...

20:56.400 --> 20:58.500
Quinn is kinda...
lookin' at me funny.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.167
- Oh, you're okay, Max.

21:00.267 --> 21:02.367
They only go into a feeding
frenzy when they smell mangoes.

21:02.467 --> 21:04.167
- Well, that's bad because

21:04.267 --> 21:06.167
I sorta just rubbed mango
all over my face.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.067
- Hot sauce.

21:23.900 --> 21:26.067
- Phoebe, I am so sorry
I didn't believe you.

21:26.100 --> 21:28.067
I ruined
our anniversary dinner.

21:28.133 --> 21:29.833
- No, you didn't ruin it.

21:29.933 --> 21:32.133
Your two-faced bestie did.

21:32.233 --> 21:35.367
- Well, aren't you
two adorable.

21:35.467 --> 21:38.433
I almost just got
my head eaten!

21:38.533 --> 21:41.600
- Of course, since Quinn
now knows where we live,

21:41.700 --> 21:43.767
I'm gonna have
to hand her over

21:43.867 --> 21:46.133
to the Hero League
for memory wiping.

21:48.167 --> 21:50.233
I'll never forget you, Link!

21:50.333 --> 21:53.167
- Yeah, you will--
in about 40 minutes.

21:53.267 --> 21:55.700
Still into Captain Boring?

21:55.800 --> 21:58.533
Well, hey, guess what?
I never liked you!

21:58.633 --> 22:01.300
Yeah, you bug-eyed
flyin' freak!

22:01.400 --> 22:03.333
Heh. Heh.

22:03.433 --> 22:06.633
So, does she
have a sister?

22:10.800 --> 22:26.400
- *
