WEBVTT

00:00.734 --> 00:03.138
Look at us.
Still together as a group

00:03.139 --> 00:06.141
even, what, two months
after being kicked out

00:06.142 --> 00:08.643
of you know where.

00:08.644 --> 00:09.844
Yeah, good thing I came up

00:09.845 --> 00:11.263
with this idea
for potluck dinners.

00:11.264 --> 00:12.864
Pierce, all you said was,
"I'm hungry."

00:12.865 --> 00:14.616
All Henry Ford said was,
"I need a ride."

00:14.617 --> 00:17.202
Troy, is that a casserole?

00:17.203 --> 00:18.403
It's bagel bites

00:18.404 --> 00:19.538
in a deconstructed
hot pocket reduction

00:19.539 --> 00:20.739
with a doritos glaze.

00:20.740 --> 00:22.991
I just really want
to make my food, you know.

00:22.992 --> 00:26.044
Did anybody bring anything
that isn't poison?

00:26.045 --> 00:28.914
I need to eat
natural, organic foods,

00:28.915 --> 00:31.399
or I'm never gonna get rid
of this hangover.

00:31.400 --> 00:32.667
Jeff, what'd you bring?

00:32.668 --> 00:34.503
Pack of lifesavers.

00:35.538 --> 00:37.055
Sorry.
Dead battery.

00:37.056 --> 00:38.706
Where's Abed?

00:38.707 --> 00:40.175
Have you seen Abed?

00:40.176 --> 00:42.661
He's probably out getting
something really cool

00:42.662 --> 00:44.212
for the dinner.

00:44.213 --> 00:50.185
See? Cool.
Abed brought delicious police.

00:50.186 --> 00:52.154
Abed, what happened?

00:52.155 --> 00:53.522
Found your friend going
through the dumpster

00:53.523 --> 00:55.723
outside the administration
building in Greendale again.

00:55.724 --> 01:00.162
This cadet could use a lesson
in intergalactic protocol.

01:00.163 --> 01:01.279
It's okay, officer.

01:01.280 --> 01:03.398
He's just playing a character
from TV.

01:03.399 --> 01:06.535
Oh, yes, I'm very familiar
with Inspector Spacetime.

01:06.536 --> 01:07.569
You think a guy becomes a cop

01:07.570 --> 01:09.204
because his prom night
was a dream?

01:09.205 --> 01:12.124
If this were comic-con,
I'd take a bullet for that kid.

01:12.125 --> 01:14.593
But, here in the real world,
trespassing is a crime.

01:14.594 --> 01:15.760
We're sorry, officer.

01:15.761 --> 01:18.013
Our friend has been having
a hard time

01:18.014 --> 01:21.349
adjusting to being expelled
from Greendale.

01:21.350 --> 01:23.335
It won't happen again.
That's for sure.

01:23.336 --> 01:26.421
I talked to your former Dean.
I recommended he press charges.

01:26.422 --> 01:27.522
He said he'd hold off

01:27.523 --> 01:29.757
on the condition that you set
an appointment with this guy.

01:29.758 --> 01:31.109
He's offering to foot

01:31.110 --> 01:32.727
the bill for the consultation
himself.

01:32.728 --> 01:34.112
It's the number
for a psychiatrist.

01:34.113 --> 01:36.264
What? No.
Abed's not crazy.

01:36.265 --> 01:38.533
Where does the Dean get off?
He's not the real Dean.

01:38.534 --> 01:40.402
He's been replaced
by an identical life-form

01:40.403 --> 01:41.853
for some nefarious purpose.

01:41.854 --> 01:43.738
Reggie, to the time booth.

01:43.739 --> 01:45.790
We haven't much...
space.

01:45.791 --> 01:48.910
I'll be right there, inspector.

01:48.911 --> 01:51.613
Hey, before I go, you really
shouldn't be using this

01:51.614 --> 01:53.381
to prop open
your building's door.

01:53.382 --> 01:54.883
This is an antique fire brick.

01:54.884 --> 01:56.501
I'd say pre-civil war.

01:56.502 --> 02:00.255
Note the uneven orange hue
and the embossment on the back.

02:00.256 --> 02:02.307
What a nifty little piece
of americana.

02:02.308 --> 02:06.061
You could get 50, 60 bucks
for it from the right collector.

02:06.062 --> 02:07.796
<i>I watch a lot
of antiques roadshow.</i>

02:07.797 --> 02:10.080
Oh.

02:10.082 --> 02:13.068
Anyway, walk to your cars
in pairs tonight.

02:13.069 --> 02:15.954
Rape's up 8%.

02:17.473 --> 02:20.909
$60?

02:20.910 --> 02:23.361
Hello?
Rich people, Troy's joining you.

02:23.362 --> 02:24.913
Yes, I'll hold.

02:58.147 --> 02:59.514
Abed.

02:59.515 --> 03:00.932
I'm Dr. Heidi.

03:00.933 --> 03:02.651
We're going to have
a little chat tonight,

03:02.652 --> 03:03.902
you and I.
How does that sound?

03:03.903 --> 03:05.186
I don't need therapy.

03:05.187 --> 03:07.355
Well, that's
a perfectly normal response.

03:07.356 --> 03:09.457
I concur
with Dr. Heidi's diagnosis.

03:09.458 --> 03:11.126
I haven't diagnosed
anything yet.

03:11.127 --> 03:12.794
Psych major.
Got your back, brah.

03:14.163 --> 03:19.334
I have to say, I didn't expect
to see so many of you.

03:19.335 --> 03:21.720
Abed won't go to any kind
of doctor on his own.

03:21.721 --> 03:22.721
We caught him last year

03:22.722 --> 03:24.489
trying to remove
his own tonsils.

03:24.490 --> 03:26.641
Well, why don't you let me
take it from here?

03:26.642 --> 03:27.826
You have to understand
about Abed.

03:27.827 --> 03:29.711
He's usually,
you know, adorable weird,

03:29.712 --> 03:32.330
like mork from ork,
but, since we got expelled,

03:32.331 --> 03:35.183
he's been creepy weird,
like present-day Robin Williams.

03:35.184 --> 03:37.218
- I'm not crazy.
- Well, Abed,

03:37.219 --> 03:39.187
I don't deal in crazy.

03:39.188 --> 03:41.222
I deal in health.
Hmm.

03:41.223 --> 03:44.859
So how long has Abed needed
a crazy amount of help?

03:47.830 --> 03:53.234
All of this behavior
started after you were expelled?

03:53.235 --> 03:56.087
There may have been
a ramp-up.

03:58.007 --> 04:00.208
It's okay, buddy.

04:00.209 --> 04:02.210
Just a few more minutes, and
we're good until spring, okay?

04:02.211 --> 04:03.745
But it doesn't make any sense.

04:03.746 --> 04:05.013
Think of it this way.

04:05.014 --> 04:07.349
We get the hour back
later in the year.

04:07.350 --> 04:10.352
Yeah.

04:10.353 --> 04:12.020
<i>I "Rent Tower Heist"
last night,</i>

04:12.021 --> 04:13.588
and I won't spoil the ending,
but let me tell you,

04:13.589 --> 04:15.774
it was quite
the hilarious Thrill Ride.

04:15.775 --> 04:19.310
That Brett Ratner, he's a master
at comedic action-adventure.

04:19.312 --> 04:21.980
Mm.
A master at storytelling.

04:21.981 --> 04:24.232
He's just a master
at making movies in general.

04:24.233 --> 04:26.601
I'm gonna say it.
He's the new Spielberg.

04:26.602 --> 04:29.771
Oh!

04:29.772 --> 04:31.489
I have to go.
Excuse me.

04:31.490 --> 04:33.408
Okay.

04:33.409 --> 04:39.280
You're a bad person.
You're a bad person.

04:39.281 --> 04:42.417
Time enough at last
to eat a sandwich.

04:42.418 --> 04:43.968
Though even he knew
that this sandwich

04:43.969 --> 04:45.920
was nearer his last sandwich
than his first.

04:45.921 --> 04:47.055
Abed, I'm trying to eat.

04:47.056 --> 04:48.556
He said, oldly,

04:48.557 --> 04:49.957
his brittle bones straining
to support the weight

04:49.958 --> 04:53.094
of his wrinkly skin.

04:53.095 --> 04:55.463
Stop narrating me.

04:55.464 --> 04:56.648
He shouted to no one,

04:56.649 --> 04:57.982
just a man alone in time
with nothing

04:57.983 --> 05:00.402
but the cold squishiness
of tuna salad to comfort him.

05:00.403 --> 05:01.853
I take it back.

05:01.854 --> 05:03.822
I don't want
to be in your novel.

05:03.823 --> 05:05.973
Pierce Hawthorne had nearly
lost his grip on reality.

05:05.974 --> 05:07.742
Lately, he'd begun to think
he was in a novel.

05:07.743 --> 05:11.363
And action.

05:11.364 --> 05:13.314
Abed, what the hell
are you doing?

05:13.315 --> 05:14.982
Cut. We got it.
One more for safety.

05:14.983 --> 05:16.217
Abed, it's 4:30
in the morning,

05:16.218 --> 05:17.485
and you're in my bedroom.

05:17.486 --> 05:18.486
Use that.
Okay.

05:18.487 --> 05:20.255
And action.

05:20.256 --> 05:23.324
But that's almost completely
nearly all of it.

05:23.325 --> 05:25.210
If Abed is as sick
as you all say,

05:25.211 --> 05:26.544
then I have no...
Wait a minute.

05:26.545 --> 05:29.163
Nobody in this room
gets to define sick.

05:29.164 --> 05:30.298
I do.

05:30.299 --> 05:31.766
I'm a psychiatrist.

05:31.767 --> 05:33.802
Any kind of doctor can really.

05:33.803 --> 05:35.002
- Really?
- Yes.

05:35.003 --> 05:36.304
Well, if Abed's sick,

05:36.305 --> 05:38.606
then we're all sick.
Yeah.

05:38.607 --> 05:40.225
You can't determine
a person's sanity

05:40.226 --> 05:41.843
from a few amusing stories.

05:41.844 --> 05:43.278
- Exactly.
- That's right.

05:43.279 --> 05:45.980
I mean, if anything,
Abed's more sane than any of us.

05:45.981 --> 05:47.014
Yeah. Well.

05:47.015 --> 05:49.868
I mean, he's certainly
the craziest one of us,

05:49.869 --> 05:54.906
but, you know, we're all
kind of crazy-town banana pants.

05:54.907 --> 05:57.375
Talk to me
about crazy-town banana pants.

05:57.376 --> 05:59.043
Look, we're just saying
it's been a crazy year

05:59.044 --> 06:00.178
for everybody.

06:00.179 --> 06:02.080
Who among us hasn't had
the odd banana

06:02.081 --> 06:03.581
in his or her pants, right?

06:03.582 --> 06:05.199
I have.

06:12.258 --> 06:16.644
How long does peyote last?
Just asking for a friend.

06:16.645 --> 06:20.548
♪ Troy and Abed and Annie
in the morning ♪

06:20.549 --> 06:21.816
What are you doing?

06:21.817 --> 06:23.151
Nothing.

06:23.152 --> 06:24.285
Nothing my ass.

06:24.286 --> 06:26.220
What are all these cameras
doing here?

06:30.659 --> 06:32.994
Here, take my coat.

06:32.995 --> 06:34.446
Oh.

06:34.447 --> 06:36.331
Thank you.

06:36.332 --> 06:38.900
That's so sweet.

06:38.901 --> 06:40.869
Just don't eat anything
or drink anything,

06:40.870 --> 06:43.872
and no sweating
or bending at the elbows,

06:43.873 --> 06:46.741
and no chairs with backrests,
and if you take it off,

06:46.742 --> 06:50.512
wooden hangers only.

06:50.513 --> 06:52.580
You're probably
warm now, right?

06:56.385 --> 06:57.685
Good news, guys.

06:57.686 --> 06:59.103
I spent all my money.

06:59.104 --> 07:00.755
Troy, you can't bring that
in here.

07:00.756 --> 07:02.590
Yes, I can.
It's all-terrain, dummy.

07:02.591 --> 07:04.309
I made a plate of cookies
for the study group,

07:04.310 --> 07:05.610
but my boys ate them,

07:05.611 --> 07:07.395
so since they took something
of yours,

07:07.396 --> 07:09.314
you all get something
of theirs.

07:09.315 --> 07:11.115
Elijah loves this, Britta.

07:11.116 --> 07:12.767
There you go, Jeff.
There you go, Troy.

07:12.768 --> 07:14.769
There you go, Pierce.

07:14.770 --> 07:18.122
Karate championship,
second place!

07:18.123 --> 07:19.874
Now I'll be unstoppable.

07:19.875 --> 07:22.109
Oyay!

07:22.110 --> 07:23.745
So you see
what you call insanity

07:23.746 --> 07:25.497
we call solidarity.

07:25.498 --> 07:26.714
I'm sorry.

07:26.715 --> 07:28.800
We just finished telling him
about it,

07:28.801 --> 07:30.134
and you grab it and squeeze it?

07:30.135 --> 07:32.119
- I said I was sorry.
- Uh-huh.

07:32.120 --> 07:35.173
And so as a group,
do you always indulge Abed

07:35.174 --> 07:37.291
in these little misadventures?

07:37.292 --> 07:38.426
Take that back.

07:38.427 --> 07:43.297
Our adventures are very manly.

07:43.298 --> 07:44.799
I have to say
there's more important

07:44.800 --> 07:46.768
to mental health
than a support system.

07:46.769 --> 07:48.436
And assuming
that this group is,

07:48.437 --> 07:51.055
for Abed, said support system,

07:51.056 --> 07:53.107
I think I've heard everything
I need to hear

07:53.108 --> 07:55.226
in order to make a decision.

07:55.227 --> 07:57.462
I think
that Abed should be committed.

07:59.131 --> 08:01.983
You mean committed
to his character work, right?

08:01.984 --> 08:04.318
Because he already is.
Abed, show him your Don Draper.

08:04.319 --> 08:05.753
Cigarettes.

08:05.754 --> 08:09.040
No, I mean an institution.

08:09.041 --> 08:10.725
You mean like marriage?

08:10.726 --> 08:12.210
I mean a mental institution.

08:12.211 --> 08:14.112
Ah. So do I.

08:14.113 --> 08:16.164
Will someone please help me
lighten the mood?

08:20.871 --> 08:23.104
Please,
Mr. Dr. psychiatrist, sir,

08:23.105 --> 08:26.742
please don't send my best friend
to crazy people jail.

08:26.743 --> 08:28.243
Relax.
He doesn't have the right.

08:28.244 --> 08:29.461
Abed's not dangerous.

08:29.462 --> 08:32.197
Yeah, he's just unique,
like a snowflake

08:32.198 --> 08:33.532
who gets bent out of shape

08:33.533 --> 08:35.167
<i>when you mix up Star Wars
and space treks.</i>

08:35.168 --> 08:37.269
Or a serial killer's signature.

08:37.270 --> 08:38.720
I'm a psych major.

08:38.721 --> 08:41.155
His continued obsession
with Greendale Community College

08:41.157 --> 08:43.142
suggests the potential
for escalation.

08:43.143 --> 08:45.060
And, frankly, these stories
you've been telling me

08:45.061 --> 08:46.395
are very troubling.

08:46.396 --> 08:47.729
You're troubled?

08:47.730 --> 08:49.481
I don't remember
any of those things happening.

08:49.482 --> 08:51.800
Since when do these three
live together?

08:51.801 --> 08:53.134
Look, Abed's obsession
with Greendale

08:53.135 --> 08:54.236
doesn't make him crazy.

08:54.237 --> 08:55.437
If you had gone
to school there,

08:55.438 --> 08:56.638
you'd be obsessed with it too.

08:56.639 --> 08:58.157
It was a messed-up place.

08:58.158 --> 08:59.558
We had lockers.
Yeah.

08:59.559 --> 09:01.193
We're survivors.

09:03.279 --> 09:05.480
My name is Pwofussa Wobinswin.

09:05.481 --> 09:07.866
Who's weady to wearn?

09:07.867 --> 09:11.453
Dean, this is not the way
to agree on parking

09:11.454 --> 09:13.989
for the job fair!
It's inhumane.

09:13.990 --> 09:15.457
You have a better idea, Britta?

09:15.458 --> 09:18.260
Yes.
Thousands of them.

09:18.261 --> 09:21.046
Vicki to Queen 3.

09:21.047 --> 09:22.998
Neigh.

09:28.938 --> 09:31.840
That's all for today.
Read chapter four.

09:35.562 --> 09:37.946
Okay, we're
just gonna ignore that.

09:39.000 --> 09:45.074

09:49.209 --> 09:50.409
- Bananas?
- Yes.

09:50.410 --> 09:51.860
- Toast?
- Yes.

09:51.861 --> 09:53.579
- Bubble gum?
- Yes.

09:53.580 --> 09:55.030
- Pancakes?
- Yes.

09:55.031 --> 09:58.000
- Fries?
- Get out.

09:58.001 --> 10:00.302
Get out.

10:00.303 --> 10:03.472
There's one every year.
I will not tolerate clowning.

10:03.473 --> 10:05.040
- Car keys?
- Yes.

10:05.041 --> 10:10.679
Okay, last bathroom break.
We've got to cram for...

10:10.680 --> 10:13.381
Excuse me, sir,
can we get to our...

10:16.019 --> 10:17.769
Slow your bones, Rufus.

10:17.770 --> 10:20.388
We got a long road tomorrow.

10:21.407 --> 10:23.742
Welcome...

10:27.163 --> 10:28.864
to ladders.

10:31.334 --> 10:33.502
Interesting.

10:33.503 --> 10:34.836
Eh.

10:34.837 --> 10:37.039
Just wanted to see
if we got the same thing.

10:37.040 --> 10:40.241
It sounds as though this
Greendale had quite an effect

10:40.242 --> 10:41.460
on all of you.

10:41.461 --> 10:43.295
You should all definitely
stop dwelling on it

10:43.296 --> 10:44.346
if you want to be healthy.

10:44.347 --> 10:46.682
Well, come on,
it wasn't all bad.

10:46.683 --> 10:48.934
I was there longer than anybody,
and I'm fine.

10:48.935 --> 10:50.102
How are you?

10:50.103 --> 10:51.553
Why do you ask?
3:30.

10:51.554 --> 10:53.772
Uh-oh.

10:53.773 --> 10:54.806
What Pierce was saying

10:54.807 --> 10:57.059
before he started sundowning
is true.

10:57.060 --> 10:59.394
We can't just pass
the crazy buck to Greendale.

10:59.395 --> 11:01.029
It could be a good place too.

11:01.030 --> 11:02.097
That really doesn't matter.

11:02.098 --> 11:03.448
Yeah, we have a lot of memories

11:03.449 --> 11:05.200
of Greendale
being in our corner.

11:05.201 --> 11:06.285
Dean-a-ling.

11:06.286 --> 11:07.569
I just wanted to drop by

11:07.570 --> 11:09.488
and tell you we ought
to be hot-stepping it out

11:09.489 --> 11:12.440
to the parking lot
in a brisk, but orderly fashion.

11:12.441 --> 11:13.492
Is there a fire drill?

11:13.493 --> 11:15.043
No, sir,
there's an actual fire.

11:15.044 --> 11:16.578
I wanted you guys
to be the first to know

11:16.579 --> 11:17.879
before I tell everyone else.

11:17.880 --> 11:19.715
I know. It's not right
to play favorites,

11:19.716 --> 11:21.466
but it is no more right
to sit on your feelings,

11:21.467 --> 11:23.001
and I don't know
what I'd do without you guys.

11:23.002 --> 11:24.136
Whoa.

11:24.137 --> 11:26.421
Okay, fire, fire!
There's a fire!

11:35.732 --> 11:36.932
Darcy, you've got a cold.

11:36.933 --> 11:39.467
- I feel fine.
- You're sick. Go home!

11:39.468 --> 11:40.852
Get out of here.
Get out of here.

11:40.853 --> 11:42.738
Get out of here.
Get out of here!

11:42.739 --> 11:45.574
I can't believe we got here
too late for pizza.

11:45.575 --> 11:47.308
Worst pizza day ever.

11:47.309 --> 11:48.610
Oh, darn it.

11:48.611 --> 11:53.281
What am I gonna do
with all this garbage?

11:53.282 --> 11:56.618
Psst, it's me, the Dean.

11:56.619 --> 12:00.655
I pulled the last six pieces
of pizza for you.

12:00.656 --> 12:02.624
Ohh.

12:02.625 --> 12:04.876
Back to garbage detail.

12:04.877 --> 12:07.662
We have a few students
with birthdays today,

12:07.663 --> 12:09.765
but, hey, why single them out?

12:09.766 --> 12:10.899
What about the students

12:10.900 --> 12:12.517
who aren't celebrating
anything at all?

12:12.518 --> 12:15.137
Are they any less special?

12:16.439 --> 12:18.673
♪ Troy and Jeffrey ♪

12:18.674 --> 12:20.609

12:20.610 --> 12:22.144

Damn it.
Out of slugs.

12:33.990 --> 12:36.158
Next time, I'll put you square,

12:36.159 --> 12:39.027
you pickle-sucking
MacGillycuddy.

12:39.028 --> 12:41.663
Why did you save me, Dean?

12:41.664 --> 12:44.883
I know how important
paintball is to you, Abed.

12:44.884 --> 12:46.501
I wanted you to win.

12:46.502 --> 12:48.637
It's not important anymore.
I get it now.

12:48.638 --> 12:51.039
It just feels forced.

12:51.040 --> 12:53.541
You just enjoy your prize...

12:53.542 --> 12:56.478
Free tickets to...

12:56.479 --> 12:58.379
<i>to see 'Chicago"
at the Greendale Civic Center...</i>

13:00.382 --> 13:04.653
with George Wendt and...

13:04.654 --> 13:09.024
Stefanie Powers.

13:10.326 --> 13:14.830
Lame!

13:14.831 --> 13:16.314
Okay.

13:16.315 --> 13:17.732
That was great,

13:17.733 --> 13:19.618
but you really didn't need
to go into it.

13:19.619 --> 13:21.236
You know what occurs to me?

13:21.237 --> 13:24.289
What all those great Greendale
memories have in common?

13:24.290 --> 13:25.290
I was barely in them?

13:25.291 --> 13:26.658
They were all
about Dean Pelton.

13:26.659 --> 13:27.826
That's what I've been trying
to make

13:27.827 --> 13:29.261
you guys understand
for the last two months.

13:29.262 --> 13:30.679
I keep telling you,

13:30.680 --> 13:32.097
we weren't expelled
by the real Dean.

13:32.098 --> 13:34.015
It couldn't have been him.
He loved us.

13:34.016 --> 13:36.918
Maybe we've been so concerned
with moving past Greendale,

13:36.919 --> 13:38.503
we've been living in denial.

13:38.504 --> 13:40.972
It's true.
I mean, let's face it.

13:40.973 --> 13:43.508
We weren't driven crazy
by Greendale.

13:43.509 --> 13:47.062
And Abed's not the crazy one
for obsessing about it.

13:47.063 --> 13:49.147
Abed, we're sorry.
We haven't been supporting you,

13:49.148 --> 13:51.366
and we haven't been honest
with ourselves.

13:51.367 --> 13:53.735
Dr. Heidi, something weird
is going on with that school.

13:53.736 --> 13:57.772
Abed doesn't need to be here.
We need to be there.

13:58.502 --> 14:00.542
But there is no there.

14:00.543 --> 14:02.944
That's the problem.
That's why we have to go back.

14:02.945 --> 14:05.213
No, you can't go back
to Greendale.

14:05.214 --> 14:06.581
Why?
Because it isn't healthy?

14:06.582 --> 14:10.218
'Cause it doesn't exist.

14:11.287 --> 14:13.288
I parked by a meter.

14:13.289 --> 14:16.057
Any of y'all park by a meter?

14:16.058 --> 14:17.058
Wait, what?

14:22.348 --> 14:24.315
What you mean,
Greendale doesn't exist?

14:24.316 --> 14:26.600
Well, there is a place
called Greendale,

14:26.601 --> 14:28.936
and you all spent
three years there,

14:28.937 --> 14:32.073
but it was
not a community college.

14:36.745 --> 14:39.747
These memories that you people
have been sharing

14:39.748 --> 14:43.451
are a shared psychosis.

14:43.452 --> 14:44.719
You were patients there
together,

14:44.720 --> 14:46.620
you were released together,
and I am alarmed to see

14:46.621 --> 14:49.724
that you are now relapsing
together.

14:49.725 --> 14:51.893
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

14:51.894 --> 14:55.296
This is not real.
You're lying.

14:55.297 --> 14:58.015
Search your mind
for the real memories.

14:58.016 --> 15:00.735
Try to look past the trauma
you've been blocking out.

15:00.736 --> 15:02.687
- What trauma?
- You all came

15:02.688 --> 15:05.473
to this community college

15:05.474 --> 15:06.774
after your lives had fractured.

15:06.775 --> 15:08.809
Pill addiction,
failed legal career,

15:08.810 --> 15:11.696
broken marriage,
lost scholarship,

15:11.697 --> 15:13.948
- old.
- Enough!

15:13.949 --> 15:15.333
I don't want to hear mine.

15:15.334 --> 15:17.418
And, if we were going
to fabricate a delusion,

15:17.419 --> 15:20.538
why would we fabricate
a community college?

15:20.539 --> 15:23.958
Ah, yes, this fantastical
community college

15:23.959 --> 15:27.462
where everything that happens
is unbelievably ridiculous

15:27.463 --> 15:30.515
and it all revolves
around you as a group.

15:30.516 --> 15:33.885
The same reason anyone plunges
into psychosis, miss Perry.

15:33.886 --> 15:35.937
It was a mentally-compatible
alternative

15:35.938 --> 15:38.055
to your grim reality.

15:42.227 --> 15:45.980
Can you believe the secret
trampoline we found?

15:45.981 --> 15:48.032
I know.
It's so great.

15:56.542 --> 15:57.825
For Greendale!

15:57.826 --> 15:59.494
Charge!

15:59.495 --> 16:00.962
Come on, Leonard.

16:00.963 --> 16:02.497

- Ooh!

16:15.561 --> 16:16.844
- Don't forget the clip show.
- Harrison Ford.

16:16.845 --> 16:18.145
Remember when we went camping?
Yes.

16:18.146 --> 16:19.313
Remember when we painted
the nursery?

16:19.314 --> 16:20.731
Yes.
Remember when we remembered

16:20.732 --> 16:22.016
going camping
while we were in the nursery?

16:25.687 --> 16:28.022
I'm a millionaire,
I'm an inventor,

16:28.023 --> 16:30.992
I'm a legend,
and I had sex with Eartha Kitt.

16:30.993 --> 16:32.159
It's sad.

16:32.160 --> 16:33.661
Should we increase
their lithium?

16:33.662 --> 16:34.728
Not yet.

16:34.729 --> 16:36.330
I want to see what happens

16:36.331 --> 16:38.666
if we confiscate
one of their pens.

16:43.672 --> 16:48.125
- It's not possible.
- Mm.

16:48.126 --> 16:52.446
You say you started
as a Spanish study group.

16:52.447 --> 16:53.931
Do any of you speak Spanish?

16:53.932 --> 16:56.467
<i>Mi hambre es bombero tirantes.</i>

16:56.468 --> 16:58.085
And you've attended Greendale
for three years,

16:58.086 --> 17:00.888
but don't community colleges
end after two?

17:00.889 --> 17:02.690
Everyone's always saying that.

17:02.691 --> 17:05.192
The average community college
student attends school

17:05.193 --> 17:06.394
five to seven years.

17:06.395 --> 17:07.895
Many offer four-year degrees.

17:07.896 --> 17:09.696
In your mind, they do.

17:09.698 --> 17:10.982
In your mind.

17:10.983 --> 17:14.768
And you shared this delusion
with each other, like that time

17:14.769 --> 17:16.369
all those people
got into swing dance music

17:16.371 --> 17:17.521
back in the '90s.

17:17.521 --> 17:19.707
And then you were released,

17:19.708 --> 17:21.375
probably because your insurance
ran out.

17:21.376 --> 17:23.527
But the official story
is that you're now fit

17:23.528 --> 17:25.997
to live within society again.

17:25.998 --> 17:29.133
You just have to accept
the truth.

17:39.928 --> 17:41.929
Wait.

17:41.930 --> 17:43.598
Give me a break.

17:43.599 --> 17:45.349
That made no sense.

17:45.350 --> 17:46.350
Yeah, it's me.

17:46.351 --> 17:48.152
No, I think they bought it.

17:48.153 --> 17:49.487
I had to do a little riffing
at the end,

17:49.488 --> 17:52.189
but I was pretty convincing.

17:52.190 --> 17:55.076
Well, if it looks like I'm
sneaking out the window,

17:55.077 --> 17:57.495
it's just a symptom
of your deepening psychosis.

17:57.496 --> 17:59.947
Don't hurt me.
Greendale doesn't exist?

17:59.948 --> 18:01.532
How long did you think
we'd buy that?

18:01.533 --> 18:03.668
I'm literally carrying
a Greendale backpack.

18:03.669 --> 18:05.503
I have, like, 1,000 pictures
of the campus on my phone.

18:05.504 --> 18:07.004
I have children
I see every day.

18:07.005 --> 18:08.506
I have definitely
not been locked up.

18:08.507 --> 18:10.091
Get him.

18:10.092 --> 18:13.444
Why would you lie to make us
think we were crazy?

18:13.445 --> 18:14.795
Because, Ms. Edison,

18:14.796 --> 18:16.547
Greendale is purgatory,

18:16.548 --> 18:18.599
and I am the devil.

18:18.600 --> 18:20.801
- What?
- I knew it.

18:20.802 --> 18:23.888
Stop letting him
make you realize stuff.

18:23.889 --> 18:25.272
These aren't even good lies.

18:25.273 --> 18:26.974
All right, fine,
I had to come up with something.

18:26.975 --> 18:28.726
You were getting too close.
Close to what?

18:28.727 --> 18:29.944
To the truth.

18:29.945 --> 18:31.062
The Indian kid was right.

18:31.063 --> 18:32.463
- He's Arabic.
- Also Polish.

18:32.464 --> 18:33.864
Whatever.
I'm a fake psychiatrist,

18:33.865 --> 18:34.982
not a fake ethnologist.

18:34.983 --> 18:36.817
The point
is your Dean was kidnapped

18:36.818 --> 18:38.235
by Ben Chang and replaced

18:38.236 --> 18:39.403
with a double.

18:39.404 --> 18:40.871
I was hired
to keep you off the scent.

18:40.872 --> 18:42.456
Chang kidnapped the Dean?

18:42.457 --> 18:43.791
Even for him, that's insane.

18:43.792 --> 18:45.660
Is it?
Think about it.

18:53.001 --> 18:55.503
Whoo!
I said hot damn!

18:55.504 --> 18:58.506
Chang...

18:58.507 --> 18:59.840
What are you doing?

18:59.841 --> 19:01.425
I'm predicting future crimes.

19:02.427 --> 19:04.011
Now I'm sick.

19:04.012 --> 19:06.063
See, you said
that would happen.

19:06.064 --> 19:07.682
You are a pre-cog!

19:17.409 --> 19:20.161
Again.

19:23.281 --> 19:25.899
You're weak.

19:25.900 --> 19:27.785
Uh, guys,

19:27.786 --> 19:29.370
while we were remembering
Chang is crazy,

19:29.371 --> 19:30.805
the fake doctor sneaked away.

19:30.806 --> 19:32.173
- Oh, crap!
- What?

19:32.174 --> 19:34.041
There goes our only chance
of clearing our names.

19:34.042 --> 19:36.844
You guys, forget about us.
The Dean has been kidnapped.

19:36.845 --> 19:39.680
He's out there somewhere,
alone and cold

19:39.681 --> 19:41.682
and most likely
trying to cobble together

19:41.683 --> 19:43.217
a sexy Patty Hearst costume.

19:43.218 --> 19:45.186
Britta's right.
Wait, what?

19:45.187 --> 19:46.937
We need to rescue the Dean.

19:46.938 --> 19:48.272
We need to get back
to that school.

19:48.273 --> 19:49.974
And we definitely never need
to do another paintball.

19:49.975 --> 19:51.559
- Yeah.
- See, therapy does work.

19:51.560 --> 19:53.944
We're cured.
Aw. Aw.

19:57.199 --> 19:59.233
Sounds like the study group
has gotten wise

19:59.234 --> 20:01.569
to Operation Doppel-Deaner.

20:01.570 --> 20:04.905
It's time for phase two.
What's phase two?

20:04.906 --> 20:06.657
Hey, I'm making up
the same plan you are.

20:06.658 --> 20:08.442
Pitches, pitches, pitches.

20:08.443 --> 20:10.423

Hello?

Hey, Jeff,

20:51.632 --> 20:53.349

Yeah, until next time,

may your dreams be sweet

20:54.618 --> 20:56.686
and your nightmares
be "spooky monster" scary
