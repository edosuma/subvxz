WEBVTT

00:06.740 --> 00:09.009
( traffic in distance )

00:24.392 --> 00:27.528
DO WE HAVE TO WAIT
FOR MY MOM TO GET BACK
FROM THE DELI?

00:27.628 --> 00:29.930
UM, YEAH,

00:30.030 --> 00:32.200
AND WE ALSO HAVE TO
WAIT FOR YOUR DAD.

00:32.300 --> 00:34.668
MY DAD MIGHT NOT
MAKE IT ON TIME.

00:34.768 --> 00:37.171
THIS IS A REALLY CRAZY WEEK
FOR HIM AT HIS JOB.

00:37.271 --> 00:40.808
MMM. DOES HE--
DOES HE WORK A LOT?

00:40.908 --> 00:42.810
I GUESS SO.

00:42.910 --> 00:47.315
UM, WHAT ARE
WE SUPPOSED TO DO UNTIL
THEY BOTH GET HERE?

00:47.415 --> 00:49.583
WE COULD PLAY
A GAME IF YOU WANT.

00:54.322 --> 00:56.023
I'VE GOT A BUNCH
OF GAMES BACK HERE

00:56.124 --> 00:58.659
IF YOU WANT TO--
IF YOU WANT TO
TAKE A LOOK.

00:58.759 --> 01:01.429
UH, THERE MIGHT BE--

01:02.930 --> 01:05.699
THERE MIGHT BE
SOMETHING HERE THAT--
DO YOU LIKE ANY OF THESE?

01:11.372 --> 01:14.342
- DO YOU HAVE ANY CARDS?
- CARDS?

01:15.676 --> 01:17.611
OKAY, MAYBE--

01:18.712 --> 01:21.249
I SHOULD HAVE

01:22.082 --> 01:23.951
SOMEWHERE
IN THIS MESS--

01:24.051 --> 01:27.288
AH. HERE WE GO.

01:28.189 --> 01:31.359
OKAY, SO WHAT KIND OF--

01:31.459 --> 01:35.229
WHAT KIND OF GAME
WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY--

01:35.329 --> 01:39.099
HEARTS, WAR,
CRAZY EIGHTS?

01:39.200 --> 01:41.835
UH, BLACKJACK.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.937
I'LL DEAL.

01:44.037 --> 01:46.240
OH. OKAY.

01:48.242 --> 01:50.544
( theme music playing )

02:07.695 --> 02:10.731
WHICHEVER ONE OF US GETS
TO 21 WITHOUT GOING OVER

02:10.831 --> 02:12.866
- WINS THE HAND.
- OH. OKAY.

02:12.966 --> 02:17.104
IF YOU STICK
ON ANYTHING BELOW 15,

02:17.205 --> 02:19.573
YOU FUCK THE DECK.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.442
- AM I ALLOWED
TO SAY THAT HERE?
- ( chuckles )

02:21.542 --> 02:23.211
SURE. YOU CAN SAY
ANYTHING YOU LIKE.

02:23.311 --> 02:26.079
OKAY, UM...

02:26.180 --> 02:29.917
WELL, I THINK
I'M GOING

02:30.017 --> 02:31.752
TO STICK.

02:31.852 --> 02:34.188
BUT YOU CAN'T
STICK ON 15.

02:36.457 --> 02:37.558
OH.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.360
YOU KIND OF SUCK
AT THIS GAME, DON'T YOU?

02:39.460 --> 02:42.463
I DO. I DON'T
UNDERSTAND THE RULES.

02:42.563 --> 02:45.766
- I HOPE THAT
DOESN'T PISS YOU OFF.
- I'M NOT PISSED OFF.

02:45.866 --> 02:48.969
IT'S JUST IF YOU DON'T
KNOW THE RULES, WHY PLAY?

02:49.069 --> 02:50.471
YOU'RE JUST WASTING
YOUR TIME HERE.

02:50.571 --> 02:53.106
I GUESS THAT'S
A GOOD POINT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

02:53.207 --> 02:55.175
I HAVE A QUESTION.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.247
- WHY AM I HERE?
- NOBODY'S EXPLAINED IT TO YOU?

02:59.347 --> 03:02.616
MY MOM SAYS
WE'RE COMING HERE
SO I'LL FEEL BETTER.

03:02.716 --> 03:05.253
MY DAD SAYS
WE'RE COMING HERE
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO.

03:05.353 --> 03:08.121
OKAY. WELL,
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I KNOW.

03:08.222 --> 03:10.424
YOU KNOW THAT
YOUR MOM AND DAD
ARE IN THE PROCESS

03:10.524 --> 03:15.062
- OF GETTING A DIVORCE--
- NO, THEY'RE NOT.

03:15.162 --> 03:18.599
SO NOBODY'S
EXPLAINED THIS TO YOU?

03:20.368 --> 03:22.403
MY PARENTS AREN'T
GETTING A DIVORCE.

03:22.503 --> 03:25.739
MY DAD'S JUST NOT LIVING
AT HOME RIGHT NOW.

03:27.007 --> 03:30.210
THAT'S--
THAT'S TRUE.

03:32.045 --> 03:35.649
BUT YOU KNOW THAT

03:35.749 --> 03:37.751
THEY ARE SEPARATED?

03:37.851 --> 03:40.821
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
THEY'RE GETTING A DIVORCE.

03:40.921 --> 03:43.090
YOU'RE RIGHT.

03:43.190 --> 03:45.359
UM, CAN I--

03:45.459 --> 03:47.328
CAN I ASK YOU WHAT

03:47.428 --> 03:49.963
YOUR MOM AND DAD
HAVE TOLD YOU?

03:50.063 --> 03:51.765
MY DAD MOVED OUT.

03:53.801 --> 03:57.338
SO HOW DO
YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?
WHAT'S THAT LIKE FOR YOU?

03:57.438 --> 04:00.207
IT'S A PAIN
AND IT'S ANNOYING.

04:00.308 --> 04:01.875
DO YOU MISS
YOUR DAD?

04:01.975 --> 04:05.513
I STILL GET TO SEE HIM.
IT'S JUST ANNOYING.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.781
WELL, THERE MUST BE
A GREAT DEAL ABOUT
THIS SITUATION

04:07.881 --> 04:10.451
THAT YOU FIND ANNOYING.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.185
YOU STILL HAVEN'T
TOLD ME WHY I'M HERE.

04:12.286 --> 04:14.355
RIGHT.
YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE

04:14.455 --> 04:16.924
YOUR MOM AND DAD
ARE SEPARATED NOW

04:17.024 --> 04:21.028
AND THEY WANT
TO MAKE SURE THAT
THEY BOTH SEE YOU.

04:21.128 --> 04:24.898
BUT I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT
OVER THE LAST MONTH OR SO

04:24.998 --> 04:27.801
THAT YOU'VE BEEN REFUSING
TO STAY AT YOUR DAD'S PLACE.

04:27.901 --> 04:32.406
MM-HMM.
SO THE REASON WE'RE
ALL MEETING HERE TODAY

04:32.506 --> 04:36.344
IS SO THAT WE CAN FIND
AN ANSWER, A SOLUTION.

04:36.444 --> 04:38.346
DID I EXPLAIN
THAT PROPERLY?
DOES IT MAKE SENSE?

04:38.446 --> 04:41.114
- YEAH.
- OKAY, GOOD.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.216
MAYBE YOU CAN EXPLAIN
SOMETHING TO ME:

04:43.317 --> 04:45.486
WHY DON'T YOU WANT TO STAY
AT YOUR DAD'S PLACE?

04:45.586 --> 04:47.488
I DON'T LIKE
HIS APARTMENT.

04:47.588 --> 04:50.524
OKAY. WHAT DO YOU
NOT LIKE ABOUT IT?

04:50.624 --> 04:52.292
IT'S ON
THE UPPER EAST SIDE.

04:52.393 --> 04:54.328
AND WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THAT?

04:54.428 --> 04:57.331
HAVE YOU BEEN TO
THE UPPER EAST SIDE?

04:58.466 --> 05:00.501
WELL, WHAT--
WHAT SPECIFICALLY

05:00.601 --> 05:02.770
DO YOU NOT LIKE
ABOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD?

05:02.870 --> 05:05.339
MY REAL HOME IS
HERE IN BROOKLYN,

05:05.439 --> 05:07.708
AND MY HOUSE IS
PRETTY CLOSE TO MY SCHOOL.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.578
IT TAKES ME
ABOUT FIVE MINUTES
TO WALK THERE,

05:10.678 --> 05:13.581
BUT AT HIS PLACE
I HAVE TO GET UP
AN HOUR EARLY

05:13.681 --> 05:16.550
- TO RIDE THE 4 TRAIN.
- OH, SO THEN WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING

05:16.650 --> 05:20.421
IS THAT YOUR DAD'S APARTMENT
IS-- IT'S INCONVENIENT.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.190
YES, AND PLUS
HE NEVER HAS ANY FOOD.

05:23.290 --> 05:25.659
- NO FOOD AT ALL?
- OKAY...

05:25.759 --> 05:29.530
MAYBE PROTEIN SHAKES,
MUSTARD AND ADVIL,

05:29.630 --> 05:32.833
BUT WHEN HE WORKS LATE
HE LEAVES MONEY
ON THE COUNTER.

05:32.933 --> 05:35.836
THERE'S THIS FANCY
GROCERY STORE DOWNSTAIRS,

05:35.936 --> 05:38.839
BUT ALL THEY REALLY HAVE
IS JARS OF WEIRD OLIVES,

05:38.939 --> 05:42.175
SO I GET A CANDY BAR
OR I CALL EMPIRE SZECHUAN

05:42.275 --> 05:45.446
- AND GET SOME SPARE RIBS.
- YOU DO ALL THIS SHOPPING
BY YOURSELF?

05:45.546 --> 05:47.080
THAT'S A BIG JOB.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.718
IT'S THE MAIN REASON
I DON'T LIKE STAYING THERE.

05:50.818 --> 05:54.287
ANY OTHER REASONS
YOU DON'T LIKE
STAYING THERE?

05:54.388 --> 05:56.323
IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO GO TO SLEEP.

05:56.424 --> 05:58.759
AH, CAN'T SLEEP
AT NIGHT THERE.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.495
NO, NOT NORMALLY.
IT'S JUST WHEN MY DAD'S
FRIENDS COME OVER.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.330
AND WHAT HAPPENS THEN?

06:03.431 --> 06:05.466
THEY HOG THE WII
AND STAY UP REALLY LATE.

06:05.566 --> 06:08.569
WAIT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
THEY-- THEY WHAT?

06:08.669 --> 06:10.237
- THE WII.
- THE WII.

06:10.337 --> 06:12.473
- IT'S A VIDEO GAME SYSTEM.
- OH, OKAY.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.274
MY DAD GOT IT FOR ME
FOR MY BIRTHDAY.

06:14.374 --> 06:18.178
HE SAYS IF I'M GOING
TO SPEND ALL MY TIME
PLAYING VIDEO GAMES,

06:18.278 --> 06:19.713
I MIGHT AS WELL
BE MOVING.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.782
BUT WHEN HIS FRIENDS
COME OVER,

06:21.882 --> 06:24.685
THEY PLAY GUITAR HERO
OVER AND OVER.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.620
MY MOM SAYS
IT'S EMBARRASSING--

06:26.720 --> 06:29.356
ALL THESE 30-YEAR-OLD MEN
PLAYING WITH TOYS.

06:29.457 --> 06:31.659
SO YOUR MOM
ISN'T HAPPY WITH...

06:31.759 --> 06:33.761
WHAT GOES ON
AT YOUR DAD'S HOUSE?

06:33.861 --> 06:35.829
- DID SHE SAY THAT TO YOU?
- YEAH, SHE DOESN'T THINK

06:35.929 --> 06:38.832
IT'S A GOOD--
THE TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT
I SHOULD BE IN...

06:38.932 --> 06:40.968
- HMM.
- ...ON SCHOOL NIGHTS.

06:41.068 --> 06:44.472
SHE WANTS ME
TO EAT A GOOD DINNER,
FINISH ALL MY HOMEWORK,

06:44.572 --> 06:47.808
AND GO TO BED ON TIME
SO I DO GOOD IN SCHOOL.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.043
WELL, DON'T YOU--
DON'T YOU WANT THAT TOO?

06:50.143 --> 06:53.313
- I GUESS SO.
IT'S MY JOB.
- MM-HMM.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.716
SO JUST
TO SUM UP SO FAR:

06:55.816 --> 06:58.018
YOUR DAD'S APARTMENT
IS TOO FAR AWAY,

06:58.118 --> 06:59.653
THERE'S NOT
ENOUGH FOOD THERE

06:59.753 --> 07:01.489
AND YOU FIND IT
VERY DIFFICULT TO SLEEP

07:01.589 --> 07:03.156
AT NIGHT-TIME WHEN
HIS FRIENDS ARE OVER.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.759
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

07:05.859 --> 07:09.229
- IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE?
- ISN'T THAT ENOUGH?

07:09.329 --> 07:11.865
WELL, I JUST WANT TO
MAKE SURE THAT I HAVEN'T
LEFT ANYTHING OUT.

07:11.965 --> 07:15.068
WHY? YOU CAN'T
DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

07:15.168 --> 07:17.137
WELL, MAYBE TOGETHER
WE CAN.

07:17.237 --> 07:20.007
FOR INSTANCE, WE CAN TELL
YOUR DAD IT'S HARD TO SLEEP

07:20.107 --> 07:22.910
WHEN HIS FRIENDS COME OVER
ON SCHOOL NIGHTS.

07:23.010 --> 07:26.446
AND IF WE TELL HIM
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH TO EAT,

07:26.547 --> 07:29.182
MAYBE HE COULD
GO SHOPPING FOR YOU.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.620
HMM?

07:32.720 --> 07:36.790
IF WE-- YOU AND I--
TALK TO HIM TOGETHER,

07:38.125 --> 07:41.729
IT'LL BE EASIER,
I THINK, FOR YOU
TO STAY WITH HIM.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.937
- ( door opens )
- Woman: I'M SORRY
TO INTERRUPT,

07:50.037 --> 07:51.404
I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF OLIVER'S FATHER

07:51.505 --> 07:53.306
HAD FINALLY SHOWN UP
WHILE I WAS OUT.

07:53.406 --> 07:57.010
OH, NOT YET, BESS,
BUT OLIVER AND I WERE
JUST HAVING A LITTLE CHAT,

07:57.110 --> 07:59.813
SO IF YOU'D
LIKE TO JUST WAIT
IN THE WAITING ROOM

07:59.913 --> 08:02.315
- TILL HE GETS HERE.
- I'M A LITTLE WORRIED THOUGH,

08:02.415 --> 08:05.485
BECAUSE THE SESSION'S
HALF OVER AND HE HASN'T
ARRIVED YET.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.555
HE WORKS IN NEW JERSEY
AND HE LIVES

08:07.655 --> 08:09.356
ON THE GODFORSAKEN
UPPER EAST SIDE.

08:09.456 --> 08:12.092
SOMETIMES I THINK
HE GOES OUT OF HIS WAY
TO BE INACCESSIBLE.

08:12.192 --> 08:15.529
- IS THAT MY SNACK?
- OH, YEAH, HERE YOU GO, BABY.

08:15.629 --> 08:18.165
- UMM...
- ( grunts )

08:18.265 --> 08:21.101
I HAVE TO MAKE SURE
OLIVER GETS SOMETHING
HEALTHY TO EAT.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.637
HE'S SUPPOSED TO STAY
WITH HIS FATHER TONIGHT

08:23.737 --> 08:25.405
AND I HAVE TO BE
AT THE NEW SCHOOL
BY 5:30, SO--

08:25.505 --> 08:29.342
SURE, BUT ACTUALLY
WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A CONVERSATION,

08:29.442 --> 08:31.244
SO IF YOU DON'T MIND,
YOU CAN WAIT

08:31.344 --> 08:33.413
IN THE WAITING ROOM
UNTIL-- JUST--

08:33.513 --> 08:36.684
OKAY, I-- I GUESS
I HAVE TO GO NOW.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.852
WHY CAN'T
SHE STAY WITH US?

08:41.555 --> 08:43.123
SURE.

08:46.393 --> 08:49.830
OH, I-- I HOPE
IT'S OKAY TO BRING
A SNACK INTO YOUR OFFICE.

08:49.930 --> 08:54.101
IT'S JUST HIS FATHER
NEVER HAS ANY FOOD
AT THE HOUSE, SO--

08:55.468 --> 08:57.237
ACTUALLY, WE WERE
JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT.

08:57.337 --> 09:00.574
OH, YEAH, OLIVER TELLS ME
IT'S LIKE A FRESHMAN DORM
OVER THERE.

09:00.674 --> 09:03.777
I'VE SENT LUKE
LIKE A MILLION
EMAILS ABOUT IT,

09:03.877 --> 09:06.680
BUT HE NEVER
WRITES ME BACK, SO--

09:06.780 --> 09:08.782
WE WERE JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT SOME WAYS

09:08.882 --> 09:11.418
THAT WE COULD MAYBE
ADDRESS THAT ISSUE.

09:11.518 --> 09:13.520
GOOD. YEAH,
THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL,

09:13.621 --> 09:17.825
BECAUSE I DO WANT
OLIVER TO FEEL SAFE
AT HIS FATHER'S HOUSE,

09:17.925 --> 09:22.996
SO-- YEAH, A LOT OF THINGS
ARE DEFINITELY GONNA HAVE
TO CHANGE AROUND THERE.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.799
SO, OLIVER,
YOU AND YOUR MOM HAVE
DISCUSSED THIS ALREADY?

09:28.301 --> 09:32.539
IT'S-- IT'S HARD ENOUGH
FOR HIM TO BE AWAY FROM
HIS OWN BEDROOM--

09:32.640 --> 09:35.208
YOU KNOW, HIS DESK,
HIS BOOKS AND...

09:35.308 --> 09:37.745
ALL HIS STUFF,
YOU KNOW.

09:37.845 --> 09:40.247
SO YOU AND OLIVER ARE
STILL IN THE SAME APARTMENT

09:40.347 --> 09:42.449
THAT YOU ALL
USED TO LIVE IN?

09:42.549 --> 09:44.451
WELL, AS LONG
AS WE CAN AFFORD IT.

09:44.551 --> 09:48.055
LUKE WANTS TO SELL,
BUT I THINK THERE'S BEEN
ENOUGH UPHEAVAL ALREADY.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.256
( door opens )

09:49.356 --> 09:51.959
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

09:52.059 --> 09:54.261
YOU MUST BE PAUL.

09:54.361 --> 09:56.163
IT'S BEEN
A REAL CRAZY WEEK

09:56.263 --> 09:57.530
BUT I KNOW
THAT'S NO EXCUSE.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.599
PLEASE SIT DOWN. WE WERE
JUST GETTING STARTED.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.069
- ALL RIGHT.
- IS THAT FOR ME?

10:02.169 --> 10:04.204
YEAH, IT'S SWAG.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.707
WE HAD A PRESENTATION
WITH THE VENDORS TODAY.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.676
OF COURSE
THEY KEPT ME LATE,

10:08.776 --> 10:10.443
BUT AT LEAST
YOU GOT SOMETHING
OUT OF IT, RIGHT?

10:10.543 --> 10:11.879
- YEAH.
- THIS IS WHAT HE DOES:

10:11.979 --> 10:13.681
HE ARRIVES LATE
WITH APOLOGIES AND GIFTS

10:13.781 --> 10:15.548
AS IF THAT'S
GONNA MAKE UP FOR IT.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.450
HEY, BELIEVE ME,
I WANTED TO BE HERE TODAY,

10:17.550 --> 10:20.053
ON TIME,
BECAUSE I WANTED
TO GET HERE

10:20.153 --> 10:22.222
BEFORE SHE HAD
A CHANCE TO SAY
TOO MANY THINGS LIKE THAT.

10:22.322 --> 10:25.092
Bess: EVERYTHING'S A JOKE
WITH HIM, EXCEPT IT'S
NEVER REALLY A JOKE.

10:25.192 --> 10:27.828
HEY, PUT THAT AWAY.
THIS IS IMPORTANT,
ALL RIGHT?

10:29.096 --> 10:33.433
WELL, NOW THAT
WE'RE ALL HERE,

10:33.533 --> 10:35.635
I THINK THERE'S--
THERE'S A FEW THINGS

10:35.736 --> 10:39.006
THAT WE NEED
TO GO OVER TOGETHER.

10:39.106 --> 10:42.810
OLIVER, WOULD YOU MIND
WAITING IN THE OTHER ROOM
FOR A FEW MINUTES...

10:42.910 --> 10:44.511
- OKAY.
- ...WHILE I TALK
TO YOUR MOM AND DAD?

10:44.611 --> 10:46.880
OKAY, LET ME
HELP YOU WITH THAT.

10:48.248 --> 10:51.719
- ( both whispering )
- YEAH, GO ON. GO AHEAD.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.377
BEFORE WE DO
ANYTHING ELSE,
I'D LIKE TO

11:17.477 --> 11:19.813
SET SOME GROUND RULES

11:19.913 --> 11:22.182
FOR OURSELVES
AND SOME GOALS.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.616
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.786
WE DON'T WANT
OUR DIVORCE TO UPSET HIM.

11:25.886 --> 11:29.656
WELL, IT'S ALREADY
UPSETTING HIM, ISN'T IT?

11:29.757 --> 11:32.059
HE'S CONFUSED, YEAH,

11:32.159 --> 11:35.195
AND WHEN HE'S CONFUSED
HE GETS UPSET.

11:35.295 --> 11:39.066
YOU KNOW,
ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT I LEARNED

11:39.166 --> 11:41.168
FROM TALKING
TO OLIVER IS THAT

11:41.268 --> 11:43.403
HE DOESN'T ACTUALLY KNOW

11:43.503 --> 11:46.473
THAT YOU TWO ARE
GETTING A DIVORCE.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.282
DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU?

11:55.382 --> 11:57.785
WELL, IT'S REALLY SAD,
BUT I HAVE TO SAY
IT'S NOT SHOCKING.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.320
REALLY?
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

12:00.420 --> 12:02.589
Luke:
BECAUSE SHE WON'T EVER
BE STRAIGHT WITH THE KID.

12:02.689 --> 12:04.257
WHENEVER SHE TALKS
TO HIM ABOUT IT,

12:04.357 --> 12:07.861
SHE MAKES IT SOUND
LIKE WE'RE JUST TAKING
A TIME OUT.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.963
I'VE BEEN PERFECTLY
CLEAR WITH HIM.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.766
LUKE IS
THE ONE WHO NEVER
EXPLAINS ANYTHING.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.835
HE TOLD OLIVER THAT
HE WAS MOVING OUT

12:14.935 --> 12:16.469
WHILE THEY WERE WATCHING
THE METS ON TV.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.738
- BESS.
- WHILE THEY WERE
WATCHING THE METS GAME,

12:18.839 --> 12:21.474
DURING A COMMERCIAL BREAK.
HE DIDN'T GIVE HIM A CHANCE
TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS--

12:21.574 --> 12:23.210
- COME ON.
- Paul: LET'S--

12:25.145 --> 12:26.847
LET'S NOT--

12:26.947 --> 12:30.350
WELL, OBVIOUSLY
THE DIVORCE IS CONFUSING

12:30.450 --> 12:33.553
AND EMOTIONAL
FOR BOTH OF YOU,

12:33.653 --> 12:35.555
BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE
HOW OVERWHELMING

12:35.655 --> 12:37.590
IT IS FOR OLIVER.

12:37.690 --> 12:40.727
BUT DOES HE UNDERSTAND NOW
THAT WE'RE GETTING A DIVORCE?

12:40.828 --> 12:43.630
- DID YOU EXPLAIN
THAT TO HIM?
- NO, I DIDN'T,

12:43.730 --> 12:46.499
BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE

12:46.599 --> 12:48.768
THAT IT'S MY JOB
TO TELL HIM THINGS

12:48.869 --> 12:52.439
THAT YOU BOTH
FIND PAINFUL
TO SAY TO HIM.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.179
I THINK THAT
ONE OF THE THINGS
WE NEED TO WORK ON

12:59.279 --> 13:02.883
IS THE BEST WAY
TO COMMUNICATE

13:02.983 --> 13:04.952
WITH HIM YOURSELVES.

13:05.052 --> 13:09.022
YOU KNOW, IT--
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO TRY
TO BE A FATHER WITH HIM

13:09.122 --> 13:11.391
WHEN HE WON'T EVEN
COME OVER TO MY APARTMENT.

13:11.491 --> 13:14.394
OKAY, LET'S-- LET'S TALK
ABOUT THAT FOR A MOMENT.

13:14.494 --> 13:19.232
OLIVER TOLD ME THAT
HE DOESN'T FEEL THAT

13:19.332 --> 13:21.601
HE CAN EAT PROPERLY
AT YOUR PLACE.

13:21.701 --> 13:24.037
WELL, IT'S TRUE.
HE'S RIGHT.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.173
THERE'S NEVER ANYTHING
IN HIS REFRIGERATOR.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.408
NO, BUT THERE'S
MONEY AND MENUS

13:28.508 --> 13:31.378
FOR HIM TO BUY WHATEVER
HE NEEDS FOR DINNER.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.380
I'M TRYING
TO TEACH THE KID

13:33.480 --> 13:36.984
- TO FEND FOR HIMSELF.
- HE'S TOO YOUNG FOR THAT.

13:37.951 --> 13:40.453
SO THE WAY
YOU SEE IT, LUKE,

13:40.553 --> 13:43.156
IS THAT OLIVER IS--

13:43.256 --> 13:45.893
WELL, YOU'RE HELPING HIM
BECOME MORE MATURE

13:45.993 --> 13:48.996
BY GIVING HIM
RESPONSIBILITY

13:49.096 --> 13:50.898
BY CHOOSING
HIS OWN MEALS.

13:50.998 --> 13:53.833
WHEN I WAS HIS AGE,
I WAS COOKING DINNER
FOR MY FAMILY EVERY NIGHT.

13:53.934 --> 13:57.137
( chuckles )
SINCE LUKE'S FAMILY
NEGLECTED HIM,

13:57.237 --> 13:59.406
I GUESS WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO NEGLECT OLIVER. THAT'S--

13:59.506 --> 14:02.109
IT'S NOT NEGLECT
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING
TO TEACH YOUR KID--

14:02.209 --> 14:04.677
YOU'RE NOT
TEACHING HIM ANYTHING.
YOU'RE HANDING HIM MONEY

14:04.777 --> 14:06.479
AND THEN
LEAVING HIM ALL ALONE.

14:06.579 --> 14:09.682
WELL, WE CAN SOLVE
THE PROBLEM OF WHAT'S
IN THE REFRIGERATOR,

14:09.782 --> 14:14.321
BUT I THINK--
YOU KNOW, I THINK
THERE'S SOMETHING...

14:14.421 --> 14:16.356
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
GOING ON HERE.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.959
WHEN OLIVER SAYS
THERE'S NOTHING TO EAT--

14:19.059 --> 14:20.293
I KNOW THIS SOUNDS
A LITTLE STRANGE--

14:20.393 --> 14:23.663
BUT IT MAY BE
HIS WAY OF SAYING

14:23.763 --> 14:27.234
HE'S NOT FEELING
NURTURED.

14:27.334 --> 14:30.904
WELL, THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
LUKE'S STRONG SUIT.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.872
HAVE YOU LOOKED
AT THE KID?

14:32.973 --> 14:35.909
HE'S GETTING WAY
TOO MUCH OF THAT KIND
OF NURTURING ALREADY.

14:36.009 --> 14:38.178
Paul:
IT ISN'T JUST
ABOUT THE FOOD.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.647
MAYBE THIS IS
HIS WAY OF SAYING

14:40.747 --> 14:44.384
THAT HE MISSES
YOU BOTH AND THE HOME
YOU SHARED TOGETHER.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.419
ISN'T THAT WHY WE'RE HERE,
SO HE'LL GET OVER THAT?

14:46.519 --> 14:48.588
I THINK THAT ONE
OF THE WAYS THAT
WE CAN HELP OLIVER

14:48.688 --> 14:50.890
IS THAT ALTHOUGH HE LIVES
IN TWO DIFFERENT HOMES,

14:50.991 --> 14:53.660
IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT HE ADHERE

14:53.760 --> 14:55.562
TO THE SAME SET
OF RULES.

14:55.662 --> 14:58.298
BESS, FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE

14:58.398 --> 15:00.200
THAT OLIVER
EATS WELL, RIGHT?

15:00.300 --> 15:02.970
AND YOU, LUKE,
YOU WANT TO GIVE HIM
THE RESPONSIBILITY

15:03.070 --> 15:04.837
OF TAKING CARE
OF HIMSELF.

15:04.938 --> 15:07.707
MAYBE WE CAN COMBINE
BOTH THOSE GOALS.

15:07.807 --> 15:10.343
I JUST THINK
THAT WE'RE ALREADY

15:10.443 --> 15:13.713
ASKING HIM
TO GROW UP TOO FAST.

15:13.813 --> 15:15.048
Paul:
MAYBE THERE'S A WAY

15:15.148 --> 15:16.950
TO HELP HIM ACHIEVE

15:17.050 --> 15:19.953
A CERTAIN KIND
OF INDEPENDENCE.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.289
I'LL BE HAPPY TO HELP HIM
IF I EVER GET TO SEE HIM.

15:22.389 --> 15:24.424
Bess:
WHEN OLIVER COMES
TO ME AND TELLS ME

15:24.524 --> 15:26.659
HE CAN'T FALL ASLEEP
AT HIS FATHER'S PLACE,

15:26.759 --> 15:28.962
I THINK I HAVE EVERY
RIGHT TO BE A LITTLE
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.398
SO YOU'VE BEEN
ASKING OLIVER

15:31.498 --> 15:34.501
ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE
AT LUKE'S HOUSE?

15:34.601 --> 15:36.336
GRILLING HIM
IS MORE LIKE IT.

15:36.436 --> 15:40.073
OF COURSE I HAVE.
I MET LUKE IN COLLEGE

15:40.173 --> 15:42.942
AND I KNOW HOW
HE USED TO LIVE
BEFORE WE GOT MARRIED.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.879
YOU KNOW,
THE REAL REASON

15:46.980 --> 15:48.848
WHY THE KID CAN'T
FALL ASLEEP AT MY PLACE

15:48.948 --> 15:51.118
IS BECAUSE WHENEVER
HE USED TO WAKE UP IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

15:51.218 --> 15:53.020
SHE'D LET HIM CLIMB
INTO BED WITH US.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.555
- OH, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.
- HE'S STILL CLIMBING
INTO BED WITH HER.

15:55.655 --> 15:58.291
- HOW INAPPROPRIATE IS THAT?
- Bess: ONE TIME.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.193
ONE NIGHT WHEN HAD
JUST MOVED OUT

16:00.293 --> 16:02.762
HE WAS FEELING LONELY,
SO I LET HIM SLEEP
IN OUR BED.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.998
I'M JUST CURIOUS, LUKE:

16:05.098 --> 16:07.134
HOW DID YOU FIND OUT
ABOUT THIS?

16:07.234 --> 16:09.236
I ASKED THE KID
HOW HIS MOM IS DOING,

16:09.336 --> 16:11.638
HE TELLS ME
SHE PRACTICALLY BEGGED HIM
TO SLEEP IN OUR BED.

16:11.738 --> 16:14.974
IT SOUNDS LIKE--
TO ME--

16:15.075 --> 16:17.177
THAT YOU'RE BOTH
ASKING OLIVER

16:17.277 --> 16:20.013
TO INFORM
ON EACH OTHER.

16:20.113 --> 16:21.914
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS
WE HAVE TO WORK ON

16:22.015 --> 16:24.317
IS TAKING HIM
OUT OF THE CROSSFIRE.

16:24.417 --> 16:27.587
THE REASON
THAT OLIVER CAN'T
FALL ASLEEP AT LUKE'S

16:27.687 --> 16:29.856
IS BECAUSE LUKE INVITES
HIS FRIENDS OVER

16:29.956 --> 16:32.492
TO STAY UP
PAST MIDNIGHT PLAYING CARDS
AND GETTING DRUNK.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.794
NOBODY'S GETTING DRUNK.
I HAVEN'T HAD A DRINK

16:34.894 --> 16:37.097
- IN TWO YEARS
AND SHE KNOWS THAT.
- Bess: WHAT I KNOW

16:37.197 --> 16:39.199
IS THAT YOU'RE UP
EVERY NIGHT PARTYING

16:39.299 --> 16:41.368
- LIKE YOU'RE
BACK AT THE FRAT.
- I'M HARDLY PARTYING.

16:41.468 --> 16:44.104
I'M PAYING
FOR A WIFE AND A KID,

16:44.204 --> 16:47.640
PUTTING THEM BOTH
THROUGH SCHOOL, AND I'D BET
HE GRADUATES BEFORE SHE DOES.

16:51.811 --> 16:53.446
IF MY MEMORY SERVES,

16:53.546 --> 16:56.483
WE AGREED THAT I WOULD
BE A STAY-AT-HOME MOM

16:56.583 --> 16:58.618
SO THAT SOMEONE IS
AVAILABLE FOR OLIVER.

16:58.718 --> 17:02.355
IT'S LUCKY
IF HE EVER GETS HOME
BY 9:00 AT NIGHT.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.524
YOU KNOW, IF THE TWO
OF YOU ARE INTERESTED
IN COUPLE'S THERAPY,

17:04.624 --> 17:07.260
- I CAN MAKE
A RECOMMENDATION.
- THANKS, BUT NO THANKS.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.362
THE ONLY GOOD THING
ABOUT GETTING A DIVORCE

17:09.462 --> 17:12.199
IS THAT WE'RE DONE
WITH ALL THAT.

17:12.299 --> 17:15.235
OKAY, SINCE WE'RE
NOT HERE TO DISCUSS
YOUR RELATIONSHIP,

17:15.335 --> 17:17.204
IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA
FROM HERE ON

17:17.304 --> 17:19.906
TO SCHEDULE
SEPARATE MEETINGS.

17:20.006 --> 17:21.774
NO, ACTUALLY,
I'D RATHER NOT.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.844
I MEAN, I WANT
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE
ALL ON THE SAME PAGE.

17:24.944 --> 17:27.114
AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE
I'M HERE TO HEAR WHAT
SHE SAYS ABOUT ME.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.749
THEN CAN WE AGREE
THAT OUR JOB IS

17:29.849 --> 17:31.618
TO FOCUS
ENTIRELY ON OLIVER?

17:31.718 --> 17:35.122
- ( vase thuds )
- OH.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.158
IS EVERYTHING OKAY? OH.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.627
IT WAS MY FAULT.
I'M SORRY.

17:43.496 --> 17:46.633
Paul: IT'S FINE.
I CAN DEAL WITH IT LATER.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.802
OLIVER, WHY DON'T YOU
COME IN AND JOIN US?

17:55.542 --> 17:57.610
OLIVER, I WAS WONDERING
IF THERE WAS ANYTHING

17:57.710 --> 18:02.415
THAT YOU WANTED
TO SAY NOW THAT
WE'RE ALL TOGETHER.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.722
WELL, I KNOW I'M SUPPOSED
TO STAY AT MY DAD'S,

18:09.822 --> 18:13.360
BUT IT'S HARD WHEN
HIS FRIENDS COME OVER
ON SCHOOL NIGHTS.

18:13.460 --> 18:16.763
WELL, UP UNTIL NOW
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED
HANGING OUT WITH US.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.631
I DO LIKE IT,
IT'S FUN,

18:18.731 --> 18:21.168
BUT IT'S HARD
FOR ME TO GO TO SLEEP

18:21.268 --> 18:23.336
AND FINISH
ALL MY HOMEWORK.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.505
Luke:
ALL RIGHT,
I'VE GOT IT.

18:25.605 --> 18:29.976
SO FROM NOW ON,
JUST YOU AND ME
ON SCHOOL NIGHTS.

18:30.076 --> 18:32.179
- GOOD?
- YEAH.

18:32.279 --> 18:34.147
SO, OLIVER,
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
THAT YOU'D LIKE

18:34.247 --> 18:36.583
TO SAY TO YOUR DAD?

18:38.151 --> 18:39.719
CAN YOU GO SHOPPING
FOR FOOD

18:39.819 --> 18:41.821
SO I HAVE SOMETHING
TO EAT AFTER SCHOOL?

18:41.921 --> 18:43.290
SWEETIE,
HOW ABOUT THIS:

18:43.390 --> 18:45.458
HOW ABOUT WE MAKE UP
A LIST TOGETHER,

18:45.558 --> 18:47.026
A SHOPPING LIST
YOU CAN GIVE TO YOUR DAD

18:47.126 --> 18:48.761
AND THEN YOU TWO CAN
GO SHOPPING TOGETHER?

18:48.861 --> 18:50.797
- I GUESS SO.
- ALL RIGHT.

18:50.897 --> 18:55.335
ALL RIGHT, SO ANYTHING ELSE
YOU'D LIKE TO CLEAR UP?

18:56.703 --> 18:59.406
- I DON'T KNOW.
- Luke: NOW LOOK, KIDDO,

18:59.506 --> 19:01.274
IT'S IMPORTANT
TO BOTH YOUR MOM AND ME

19:01.374 --> 19:03.276
THAT YOU FEEL OKAY
ABOUT THIS,

19:03.376 --> 19:05.745
THAT WAY WE CAN
ALL START MOVING ON
WITH OUR LIVES.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.881
Bess: WE'LL NEVER
FORCE YOU TO DO ANYTHING

19:08.981 --> 19:10.783
YOU'RE NOT
READY FOR, OKAY?

19:18.391 --> 19:20.126
I DON'T WANT TO STAY
AT MY DAD'S HOUSE.

19:20.227 --> 19:22.962
- OLIVER, COME--
- I WANT TO STAY
AT MY REAL HOUSE.

19:23.062 --> 19:24.731
OLIVER, EVEN THOUGH

19:24.831 --> 19:27.600
YOUR DAD HAS AGREED
TO MAKE SOME CHANGES,

19:27.700 --> 19:30.069
ARE YOU SAYING
THAT YOU WOULD STILL
BE UNCOMFORTABLE

19:30.169 --> 19:32.071
STAYING
AT HIS APARTMENT?

19:32.171 --> 19:34.407
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

19:34.507 --> 19:37.076
Luke:
SHE REARRANGES
BOTH OUR LIVES

19:37.176 --> 19:39.346
JUST FOR THIS,
THEN THROWS IT ALL OUT

19:39.446 --> 19:42.282
THE MINUTE
HE PITCHES A FIT.

19:43.783 --> 19:46.286
( whispers ) SHIT.

19:50.823 --> 19:53.760
OLIVER, ARE YOU--
ARE YOU COMING
OR AREN'T YOU?

19:55.628 --> 19:57.864
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DO ANYTHING YOU DON'T
WANT TO DO, OKAY?

19:57.964 --> 20:00.132
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

20:00.233 --> 20:02.402
THAT'S REALLY GONNA
HELP HIM GROW UP.

20:05.238 --> 20:07.574
THANKS, BESS.

20:13.513 --> 20:16.449
Bess: I WANT
TO APOLOGIZE FOR LUKE.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.785
BUT THEN I ALWAYS WANT
TO APOLOGIZE FOR LUKE.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.220
I SHOULD PROBABLY STOP
DOING THAT, RIGHT?

20:21.321 --> 20:24.924
MAYBE WE SHOULD APOLOGIZE
TO OLIVER TOO.

20:25.024 --> 20:29.296
SOMETIMES ADULTS
FORGET THE RULES.

20:32.365 --> 20:34.166
Bess: I GUESS
IT ALL CONTINUES.

20:34.267 --> 20:36.303
YEAH.

20:36.403 --> 20:38.505
- YEAH.
- ( sniffles )

20:38.605 --> 20:40.607
- COME ON.
- Paul: OKAY?
OKAY, OLIVER?

20:43.476 --> 20:45.745
- BYE.
- GOODBYE.

20:48.648 --> 20:51.284
- I'LL JUST--
- NO NO NO NO,
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.720
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.522
BYE.

21:00.126 --> 21:02.695
( sighs )

21:13.973 --> 21:15.675
( chuckles )

21:17.243 --> 21:19.746
music playing )
