The daughter Rachel,
where was she?

12:57.141 --> 12:58.576
She was at a sleepover.

12:58.609 --> 13:00.611
How many times
I gotta tell you that?

13:04.148 --> 13:07.151
I told you, I don't remember
anything about what happened.

13:07.185 --> 13:08.786
We talked to your car.

13:08.819 --> 13:09.820
You talked to my car?

13:09.853 --> 13:14.158
We retraced your steps
using GPS.

13:14.192 --> 13:16.660
You stopped at a gas station
on your way home from dinner,

13:16.694 --> 13:19.597
where a very large
Latino man approached you.

13:20.280 --> 13:21.314
We haven't been able

13:21.348 --> 13:22.449

Do you know what
trepanning is, Peter?

13:33.526 --> 13:36.329
No.

13:36.363 --> 13:37.798
It was an ancient cure

13:37.831 --> 13:39.366
for head pain.

13:39.399 --> 13:41.735
They thought the pain was
caused by spirits in your head,

13:41.769 --> 13:43.036
so they would drill
a hole in your skull

13:43.070 --> 13:44.037
to let the spirits out.

13:44.071 --> 13:46.506
Do we have to drill a hole
in your head, Peter?

13:46.539 --> 13:48.776
Peter:
Why would you say
something like that?

13:48.809 --> 13:51.144
What kind of person
says something like that?

13:51.178 --> 13:53.246
It's gonna hurt
when you look inside

13:53.280 --> 13:55.280
and remember what happened
to you and to your wife.

13:55.282 --> 13:57.851
My wife is dead.

13:57.885 --> 13:58.852
No,

13:58.886 --> 14:00.420
she's still dying.

14:00.453 --> 14:02.790

happened in that car

14:02.823 --> 14:04.091

14:13.500 --> 14:16.736
There was this guy.

14:18.972 --> 14:21.474
He came up to us.

14:23.376 --> 14:24.444
He had a gun,

14:24.477 --> 14:26.246
and...

14:29.582 --> 14:33.186
He told me to get
in the car and drive.

14:35.455 --> 14:39.059
But Shelby,
she couldn't calm down.

14:39.092 --> 14:41.528
He kept waving his gun.

14:41.561 --> 14:44.531
She was gonna
get herself killed.

14:46.533 --> 14:50.070
And I reached for it.

14:50.103 --> 14:51.204
I fought with him,

14:51.238 --> 14:56.109
and I got my hand on the gun,

14:56.143 --> 14:58.411
and Shelby turned around

14:58.445 --> 15:03.050
and I see...

15:03.083 --> 15:05.953
That the gun went off.

15:10.257 --> 15:12.092
He just jumped out,

15:12.125 --> 15:14.828
and I drove fast.

15:17.197 --> 15:20.067
She was bleeding.

15:20.100 --> 15:21.935
She was dying.

15:21.969 --> 15:25.605
I put my hand over her wound.

15:25.638 --> 15:28.441
I lost control.

15:37.484 --> 15:41.021
Why would you want me
to remember that?

Do you want me to say
it was him when it wasn't?

We've got motive if Stylman
wants out of the marriage

24:00.052 --> 24:02.021

25:54.133 --> 25:55.634
It's a free country.

25:55.667 --> 25:57.303
I don't have to tell you
that's the law.

25:57.336 --> 25:59.638
The law of the land is freedom.

25:59.921 --> 26:00.856
Yes, that's the law,

26:00.889 --> 26:03.225
but the money and the badge
are not the law.

26:03.259 --> 26:06.962
The money and the badge

27:41.056 --> 27:44.693
Do you know that native
Americans considered coyotes

27:44.726 --> 27:47.629
to be tricksters, scavengers,

27:47.663 --> 27:51.066

They're survivors.

Coyotes are the only indigenous

the Europeans settled here.

39:38.611 --> 39:40.279
thinking if it ever
came down to it,

39:40.313 --> 39:41.981
he'd be the hero.

it's not gonna stick.

39:47.053 --> 39:48.387
A jury will never believe him.

39:48.421 --> 39:50.223
He's changed his story
too many times.

Don't hassle me.
I'll get you the money.

I'll split it with you.

you owe me 11.
