00:45.667 --> 00:49.638
I promise you, our life
will never be boring.

00:49.671 --> 00:51.353
The greatest minds.

00:51.378 --> 00:53.246
The most delicious food.

00:53.967 --> 00:55.411
The best wine.

00:56.355 --> 00:58.641
A life bursting with art and music!

01:17.166 --> 01:21.036
We'll make love under the stars.

01:24.153 --> 01:26.496
A love unbound by time,

01:26.582 --> 01:28.551
a love untethered from gravity.

01:35.317 --> 01:37.553
Susan, if you'll be my wife,

01:37.672 --> 01:39.674
I promise you this and more.

01:41.798 --> 01:44.424
If the night is clear
when you get this,

01:44.618 --> 01:46.887
go out and look at the Pole star.

01:52.868 --> 01:55.434
Let us make that our star.

01:55.594 --> 01:57.459
Undimmed by time

01:57.539 --> 02:00.842
or any of the little things of Earth.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.090
Gotcha.

02:04.873 --> 02:07.634
You were looking at our star,
weren't you?

02:13.307 --> 02:15.134
What've you got there?

02:15.170 --> 02:16.772
Nothing.

02:17.791 --> 02:20.696
My Susan keeping secrets?

02:26.058 --> 02:28.648
I told you we weren't
gonna need this check.

02:28.783 --> 02:30.818
I know, I...

02:31.031 --> 02:32.318
I found it in my purse.

02:32.343 --> 02:34.045
I wasn't sure what to do with it.

02:34.736 --> 02:36.571
Up to you.

02:40.795 --> 02:42.930
- How's it all going?
- Great.

02:42.980 --> 02:44.482
I was reluctant to bring anyone else

02:44.516 --> 02:47.986
onto the team at first,
but I gotta say,

02:48.019 --> 02:51.156
it's kind of nice having people
working under me for a change.

02:51.323 --> 02:53.291
I'm sure you're a natural at it.

02:58.130 --> 02:59.788
I'm gonna go get ready for bed.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.639
I'm beat.

04:36.087 --> 04:38.456
Corpus Christi.

04:46.017 --> 04:48.153
Sanguis Christi.

04:58.283 --> 04:59.718
Amen.

05:09.294 --> 05:11.189
Vice everywhere you look,

05:11.214 --> 05:12.831
corruption.

05:12.864 --> 05:14.833
I had to go downtown the other
day on an errand,

05:14.866 --> 05:17.225
felt like I was driving through
Babylon itself.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.222
What do you expect when the so-called.

05:19.247 --> 05:22.283
City of Angels is run by
the devil himself?

05:22.308 --> 05:25.258
I know what you mean.
Every day I feel like I wake up

05:25.283 --> 05:28.211
to another infuriating headline.

05:30.001 --> 05:31.469
Thank you.

05:31.494 --> 05:34.497
I think Mayor Shaw is doing
the best he can.

05:34.853 --> 05:37.322
Those articles are nothing
but salacious gossip.

05:37.356 --> 05:38.607
My wife is right.

05:38.632 --> 05:40.234
Remember, whoever practices evil

05:40.259 --> 05:41.593
pays attention to wicked speech.

05:41.626 --> 05:43.782
And the liar listens to malicious talk.

05:43.934 --> 05:46.436
- May I?
- Hold your horses.

05:55.246 --> 05:57.915
We need to make sure
everyone gets some.

06:31.288 --> 06:33.157
The record was skipping.

06:38.443 --> 06:41.313
It's scratched from
being played so much.

06:41.686 --> 06:44.222
I'd be happy to pick up a replacement.

06:44.255 --> 06:46.024
Well, that would be wonderful, Susan.

06:46.057 --> 06:49.093
Janice in the office will make
sure you're reimbursed.

06:49.235 --> 06:50.729
What should I get?

06:50.762 --> 06:52.259
There are some contemporary composers

06:52.284 --> 06:53.873
doing some really interesting things.

06:53.898 --> 06:56.047
Have you heard of Stravinsky?

06:56.072 --> 06:58.208
Maybe we should get another Haydn.

06:58.262 --> 06:59.371
Same one.

06:59.404 --> 07:02.095
In such uncertain times,

07:02.120 --> 07:05.790
there is a great comfort
to be found in the familiar.

07:11.650 --> 07:14.630
I was, balancing our
accounts the other day

07:14.655 --> 07:18.626
and I noticed that the check
I gave you hasn't cleared.

07:18.823 --> 07:21.679
I was worried you may
have misplaced it.

07:21.893 --> 07:23.892
I haven't.

07:24.041 --> 07:26.277
Well, is there any other
reason for the delay?

07:26.999 --> 07:28.889
If you're worried about how
you're going to pay me back,

07:28.913 --> 07:30.448
you needn't be.

07:30.554 --> 07:31.854
You can work extra hours

07:31.879 --> 07:33.556
and I'll apply your salary to the loan.

07:33.581 --> 07:35.580
Interest-free, of course.

07:36.020 --> 07:38.441
Goodness knows I'm not trying
to profit off my own daughter.

07:38.488 --> 07:39.578
It's not that.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.498
Jack doesn't think
we're going to need it.

07:41.551 --> 07:43.815
What, so his position at Caltech
has come through, then?

07:49.488 --> 07:51.140
Here, for the record.

07:51.196 --> 07:53.288
Father Shelby said
they'd reimburse me.

07:53.313 --> 07:54.814
I'd just as soon it was a gift.

07:54.999 --> 07:57.070
The collection plate was
a bit light this morning

07:57.095 --> 07:59.730
and I don't want you spending
any money you don't have.

08:03.616 --> 08:05.537
Are you coming?

08:05.696 --> 08:07.064
It's nice out.

08:07.177 --> 08:08.713
Think I'm going to walk.

09:22.346 --> 09:23.648
Sorry.

09:25.984 --> 09:27.452
My goodness.

09:27.486 --> 09:29.053
Is she okay?

09:29.087 --> 09:31.089
- You all right?
- Yeah.

10:19.531 --> 10:21.411
We need to account for
the Reynolds number.

10:21.436 --> 10:23.350
No, I'm telling you,
the Reynolds number

10:23.375 --> 10:25.769
will be relatively small in...

10:25.817 --> 10:27.185
in spite of the speed.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.561
But we must consider

10:28.586 --> 10:30.103
how each variable impacts the whole.

10:32.819 --> 10:35.521
Sorry. Sorry.

10:36.387 --> 10:38.608
It isn't any better out here.

10:38.710 --> 10:40.661
You know, we could
try closing the door.

10:40.732 --> 10:43.256
I'd worry about him
asphyxiating himself.

10:44.733 --> 10:46.480
I was hoping his
methodology would change

10:46.505 --> 10:48.007
once we got to campus,

10:48.087 --> 10:49.555
but perhaps I was being naive.

10:53.048 --> 10:55.918
Do his methods
at least achieve results?

10:55.943 --> 10:57.156
They seem to,

10:57.181 --> 10:58.704
though they can be hard to quantify.

11:01.490 --> 11:03.492
He'll be the reason we all succeed,

11:03.615 --> 11:05.627
or the reason for our untimely death.

11:11.405 --> 11:12.573
'Kay.

11:19.775 --> 11:22.379
Whatcha got going on here, Jack?

11:22.511 --> 11:24.369
Trying different fuel combinations

11:24.394 --> 11:26.089
and measuring energy release.

11:26.202 --> 11:27.436
Very scientific.

11:29.279 --> 11:30.642
How do you know what you're testing?

11:30.666 --> 11:32.383
Most of this stuff isn't labeled.

11:34.163 --> 11:35.962
Smell that.

11:37.460 --> 11:38.694
Ooh.

11:38.719 --> 11:39.874
That's benzene.

11:42.877 --> 11:44.566
Do you know them all by smell or...?

11:44.613 --> 11:45.906
Not all of them.

11:46.022 --> 11:47.523
Some I know by taste.

11:50.038 --> 11:51.840
What are you working on?

11:51.927 --> 11:53.590
I'm kind of just on the sidelines

11:53.615 --> 11:55.055
until you got the fuel squared away.

11:57.379 --> 12:02.117
How does a guy specialize in
something like fluid dynamics?

12:02.720 --> 12:04.987
I guess I got my dad to blame.

12:05.668 --> 12:06.776
He's in oil,

12:06.801 --> 12:08.624
so he had me working
on the rigs every summer,

12:08.657 --> 12:10.292
thought it'd make a man out of me.

12:10.325 --> 12:11.359
I hated it.

12:11.384 --> 12:13.252
Calculating hydrostatic pressure?

12:13.328 --> 12:15.088
That got me out of doing
the real grunt work.

12:15.420 --> 12:16.779
That's excellent.

12:16.804 --> 12:19.740
No amount of formal education
can trump real-life experience.

12:22.798 --> 12:24.698
You guys might want
to clear out of here.

12:25.092 --> 12:28.070
And try not to breathe,
this stuff's highly toxic.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.638
These tests have to stop, Jack.

12:36.670 --> 12:38.883
- You're right.
- Wait, what did you say?

12:40.320 --> 12:42.558
They're not getting us anywhere.

12:42.790 --> 12:44.792
The nature of combustible
reactions changes

12:44.817 --> 12:45.893
based on volume.

12:45.918 --> 12:47.539
- Are we saying the same thing?
- Yeah.

12:47.576 --> 12:50.121
We need to start running
full-scale chemical tests.

12:50.146 --> 12:52.095
Goddamn it, Jack. That's not
what I'm saying at all.

12:52.119 --> 12:54.502
Mesulam said that we had
to present a written proposal

12:54.527 --> 12:55.809
before we did anything dangerous.

12:55.833 --> 12:57.229
Come on, Samson.

12:57.254 --> 12:59.322
You know the value
of seeing things in action.

12:59.347 --> 13:01.049
Back me up.

13:03.738 --> 13:05.607
Guys.

13:05.668 --> 13:07.291
How can I map new territory

13:07.316 --> 13:09.427
if I'm not allowed to explore?

13:11.217 --> 13:13.565
We aren't moving fast enough!

14:49.282 --> 14:50.837
Hey!

14:51.555 --> 14:53.373
What do you think?

14:53.721 --> 14:55.175
The music.

14:55.609 --> 14:57.441
I was in the store looking
for something to play tonight.

14:57.465 --> 14:59.082
This here's an odd bunch.

14:59.107 --> 15:00.574
Never know what they're gonna like.

15:00.599 --> 15:02.534
And what do you know? Who do I see?

15:03.125 --> 15:04.459
That was just a coincidence?

15:04.484 --> 15:06.286
My teacher says
there are no coincidences.

15:06.353 --> 15:07.987
After you left,
I slipped into the booth,

15:08.012 --> 15:09.714
ended up listening
to the whole damn thing.

15:09.739 --> 15:11.107
Never heard anything like it.

15:11.858 --> 15:13.918
Yeah, it's a rare pressing from France.

15:13.987 --> 15:15.856
The only copy I've found.

15:16.327 --> 15:18.959
Well, if you like it so much,
why didn't you buy it yourself?

15:19.153 --> 15:21.494
Ernest, come on. It's your turn.

15:21.994 --> 15:23.766
Yeah. I got to get back.

15:23.912 --> 15:25.119
You should join.

15:25.144 --> 15:27.313
We have plenty of food, plenty of wine.

15:28.134 --> 15:29.954
- I can't.
- Jack's not home.

15:29.979 --> 15:32.339
What do you got to go back for?

15:33.326 --> 15:35.356
You know what?
It's none of my business.

15:35.381 --> 15:37.057
I'm sure you have plenty
to be getting along with.

15:37.081 --> 15:39.551
- Thank you again.
- For what?

15:40.526 --> 15:43.723
For showing me something I never
would have found on my own.

15:49.143 --> 15:51.445
This became a proper
little dance party?

15:56.657 --> 15:58.659
All around, I'd say.

16:03.242 --> 16:05.144
Is it always like that?

16:05.585 --> 16:08.202
Loud parties are the least of it.

16:11.266 --> 16:13.620
Do you want me to go
and tell him to turn it down?

16:14.006 --> 16:15.875
No, it's okay.

16:20.974 --> 16:22.474
It's good to see you, Richard.

16:22.499 --> 16:24.388
I can hardly remember the last time.

16:24.444 --> 16:26.608
Believe me, the novelty'll wear off.

16:26.700 --> 16:29.016
- Be nice.
- I'm always nice.

16:29.041 --> 16:30.299
He's the one giving me a hard time.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.374
He's just upset

16:31.399 --> 16:33.412
because he has to follow
the rules occasionally.

16:33.573 --> 16:35.108
Well, I hope he's thanked you.

16:35.405 --> 16:36.632
For what?

16:36.657 --> 16:38.292
The position.

16:38.424 --> 16:39.747
At Caltech.

16:39.806 --> 16:41.877
She's talking about
the research associate position

16:41.902 --> 16:43.628
I'm getting
once our funding comes through.

16:43.683 --> 16:46.219
Right, of course.

16:48.693 --> 16:51.791
I remember the last time
Richard came over for dinner.

16:52.149 --> 16:54.436
We tried to set him up with
that secretary from your office.

16:54.460 --> 16:55.541
My God.

16:55.566 --> 16:58.392
That woman was the worst
bridge player I have ever seen.

16:58.417 --> 17:00.348
It wasn't about winning at bridge.

17:00.373 --> 17:02.118
It was about getting her in the sack.

17:02.181 --> 17:03.664
- Jack!
- What?

17:03.784 --> 17:07.165
I'm sure Richard is just saving
himself for the right girl.

17:19.231 --> 17:20.730
What the hell was that about?

17:20.755 --> 17:22.386
- Thanks for backing me up.
- Did you tell her

17:22.410 --> 17:23.690
that you got an offer for a job?

17:23.714 --> 17:25.522
You all have stipends, Richard.

17:25.570 --> 17:28.219
After the funding's approved,
I assumed we'd address

17:28.257 --> 17:29.766
bringing me onto the team full time.

17:29.791 --> 17:31.000
Or did you think I wanted to work

17:31.024 --> 17:32.417
in a chemical plant
for the rest of my life?

17:32.441 --> 17:34.042
So you just lied to her?

17:34.328 --> 17:36.369
It's not a lie if it's gonna
come true eventually.

17:36.402 --> 17:38.872
No wonder you were in such a
hurry to finish the proposal.

17:38.897 --> 17:41.533
I'm in a hurry
to push the work forward.

17:41.801 --> 17:43.803
Proposal's more of an impediment.

17:44.216 --> 17:47.356
Then I am glad I had an ulterior
motive in coming here tonight.

17:51.376 --> 17:52.529
What is that?

17:52.577 --> 17:53.858
I thought maybe we could work together

17:53.882 --> 17:55.876
on the fuel section on paper.

17:55.995 --> 17:57.934
Are you serious?

17:57.959 --> 18:01.029
I am, if you're serious
about getting funded.

18:05.882 --> 18:07.667
Hey, um...

18:07.701 --> 18:09.979
If you're looking for us,
we're gonna be in the garage.

18:10.097 --> 18:11.731
Banging our heads against the wall.

18:12.118 --> 18:13.919
Okay.

19:33.561 --> 19:36.304
Once we determine the
internal energy of the reaction,

19:36.329 --> 19:39.439
we can calculate
the theoretical temperature

19:39.998 --> 19:41.265
and the chamber pressure.

19:42.855 --> 19:45.724
It's exhausting just
to hear you say it.

19:46.105 --> 19:48.155
Of course, the exit velocity

19:48.208 --> 19:51.211
and mass flow rate are
important variables for thrust.

19:52.763 --> 19:54.478
So this is where you build the rockets!

19:54.514 --> 19:55.978
What the hell are
you all doing out there?

19:56.002 --> 19:57.837
Building a bonfire.
I just cut down a tree

19:57.862 --> 20:00.105
in my front yard, cannot get
the damn wood to light.

20:00.130 --> 20:02.512
Figured you'd have something
to help me. Who's your buddy?

20:02.676 --> 20:04.077
Richard.

20:04.484 --> 20:05.936
Pleased to meet you.

20:05.978 --> 20:09.040
So, which one of these here's
gonna get my fire to start?

20:09.539 --> 20:10.895
Put that down. It's dangerous.

20:10.946 --> 20:11.997
Exactly what I'm looking for.

20:12.021 --> 20:13.030
Um, we're kind of in the
middle of something.

20:13.054 --> 20:14.389
Ammonium nitrate?

20:16.055 --> 20:17.695
It's an oxidizer.

20:17.720 --> 20:20.589
And when you combine a
fuel and an oxidizer,

20:21.055 --> 20:22.489
all you need is a light.

20:26.612 --> 20:27.981
See? Dangerous.

20:28.274 --> 20:29.689
- Can I borrow that?
- No!

20:29.714 --> 20:31.291
This stuff should only
be handled by someone

20:31.315 --> 20:33.217
who knows what he's doing.

20:35.222 --> 20:39.277
Guess I'll... get some gasoline
from my bike, then.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.917
I told you he was off his rocker.

20:50.990 --> 20:52.335
Him? Jesus, Jack,

20:52.360 --> 20:54.688
- you nearly burnt his face to a crisp.
- Please.

20:54.713 --> 20:56.881
I know these chemicals
like the back of my hand.

20:56.906 --> 20:59.554
They speak to me, and
this is not the fucking

20:59.579 --> 21:02.216
- language they speak.
- We can figure it out this way.

21:02.909 --> 21:04.410
You just need to be patient.

21:04.514 --> 21:06.287
At this rate,
my marriage is gonna be over

21:06.312 --> 21:08.447
before our first rocket
leaves the ground.

21:11.764 --> 21:13.766
You want that on your head?

21:19.281 --> 21:20.893
I'm not asking you as a colleague.

21:20.918 --> 21:22.753
I'm asking you as a friend.

21:22.953 --> 21:25.725
Um... do you even have a way to...

21:25.998 --> 21:28.943
get the kind of chemicals
that we're talking about?

21:47.100 --> 21:49.880
You're gonna be late, Professor.
Come on, man.

21:49.957 --> 21:52.839
This guy...

21:52.946 --> 21:54.599
Professor?

21:54.624 --> 21:56.946
You remember that fancy new job
he's always keep talking about?

21:56.970 --> 21:58.200
That's right.

21:58.225 --> 22:00.194
He keeps saying he's
quitting any day now.

22:00.773 --> 22:02.641
Just keeps showing up.

22:03.622 --> 22:04.875
- How are you doing?
- Good, good.

22:04.899 --> 22:05.929
All right.

22:05.966 --> 22:07.096
- No.
- I haven't even...

22:07.121 --> 22:08.489
I said no.

22:09.748 --> 22:11.467
You know I'm right, Chiang.

22:11.512 --> 22:14.148
Energy release is not
a linear progression.

22:14.914 --> 22:16.819
We need to start running
full-scale tests.

22:16.844 --> 22:19.643
Look what you did with even a
small amount of chemicals.

22:19.668 --> 22:21.471
And I learned more
from that one mistake

22:21.496 --> 22:23.481
than if I'd spent weeks
at that chalkboard.

22:23.552 --> 22:26.912
While you might not
care, or even be aware,

22:27.126 --> 22:29.261
there's a war on the
other side of the Pacific.

22:29.329 --> 22:32.699
My father, my brother...
They all fight the Japanese.

22:32.985 --> 22:35.312
If I'm forced to go back, I will, too,

22:35.428 --> 22:38.097
which would be a tragic
waste of my abilities.

22:38.197 --> 22:40.032
Why would you be forced to go back?

22:40.120 --> 22:42.923
I need the faculty to approve
an extension of my visa.

22:43.330 --> 22:45.024
What do you think will
happen if I'm caught

22:45.049 --> 22:47.297
bringing restricted
chemicals onto campus?

22:47.322 --> 22:49.167
Who said anything about getting caught?

22:53.980 --> 22:57.412
Okay, listen, fellas,
out of solidarity with Chiang,

22:57.437 --> 22:59.573
I'm gonna have
to sit this one out, too, okay?

22:59.625 --> 23:02.762
Are you gonna spend your
whole life on the sidelines?

23:03.456 --> 23:05.431
The real Samson slayed a thousand men

23:05.456 --> 23:07.891
and destroyed a temple
with his bare hands.

23:09.375 --> 23:10.736
I'm giving you a chance

23:10.761 --> 23:13.064
to live up to the name
your father gave you.

23:23.316 --> 23:25.752
Well, we ran it past them.

23:27.420 --> 23:29.209
I guess it's just you and me.

23:29.396 --> 23:31.329
As always.

25:11.036 --> 25:14.160
Pueblo's really just
donating this stuff to us?

25:14.346 --> 25:16.348
Yeah.

25:17.089 --> 25:18.457
They asked me to discard it.

25:18.482 --> 25:20.917
We're just discarding
it somewhere else, okay?

25:21.086 --> 25:22.632
Let's go.

25:45.245 --> 25:46.618
Jesus, how much are we taking?

25:46.643 --> 25:48.017
Just a barrel of nitric acid

25:48.042 --> 25:50.111
and a cylinder of dinitrogen tetroxide.

25:50.696 --> 25:51.931
Not much.

25:53.886 --> 25:56.702
You gonna help me
get them in the truck?

26:17.997 --> 26:19.666
- Jesus Christ.
- Careful.

26:27.520 --> 26:29.755
All right, one more.

26:30.382 --> 26:31.544
Okay. You got it?

26:31.569 --> 26:32.703
One, two, three...

26:32.728 --> 26:34.404
Okay.

26:40.733 --> 26:42.264
Admit it, you're having fun.

26:42.402 --> 26:45.472
Sure, what's not to love
about grand larceny?

26:45.558 --> 26:46.959
Richard...

26:47.927 --> 26:49.162
Richard...

26:51.977 --> 26:54.321
There's the Richard I know and love.

26:54.941 --> 26:58.686
Glad to see Caltech hasn't
completely stamped him out.

27:07.013 --> 27:08.703
You sure that's a good idea?

27:11.244 --> 27:12.540
Fair point.

27:13.219 --> 27:15.373
Genius chemist over here.

27:37.997 --> 27:39.733
Jesus Christ.

27:41.706 --> 27:43.508
Look what the cat dragged in.

27:43.879 --> 27:45.398
I thought about what you said.

27:45.491 --> 27:46.758
Can't contribute a damn thing

27:46.783 --> 27:48.054
until you got the fuel figured out,

27:48.078 --> 27:49.551
and I'm sick of being on the sidelines.

27:49.575 --> 27:50.876
Boy's a hero after all.

27:50.937 --> 27:52.301
Too bad you already
missed the fun part.

27:52.325 --> 27:54.127
Now we just need help unloading.

27:57.069 --> 27:59.788
You're just going
to drive restricted chemicals

27:59.813 --> 28:01.690
right onto campus?

28:02.187 --> 28:05.591
Yeah. You got a better idea?

28:06.932 --> 28:09.645
Matter of fact, I do.

28:11.637 --> 28:15.257
So, Jack, there are four
resident houses at Caltech.

28:15.520 --> 28:17.884
I happen to reside at Blacker.

28:17.984 --> 28:21.020
They call them mole people
because, supposedly,

28:21.045 --> 28:23.447
they have the keys to the steam tunnels

28:23.472 --> 28:24.974
that run under the campus.

28:25.284 --> 28:27.726
Not supposedly, definitively.

28:27.834 --> 28:30.736
Shall we?

28:40.298 --> 28:43.688
Jack... how combustible is this stuff?

28:43.829 --> 28:45.798
Without fuel?

28:45.904 --> 28:47.330
Not at all.

28:50.262 --> 28:51.831
Of course...

28:53.240 --> 28:55.291
if it were to rupture...

28:56.028 --> 28:57.196
Shit.

29:09.008 --> 29:11.978
What did you say would happen

29:12.003 --> 29:13.671
if that thing ruptured?

29:14.122 --> 29:15.961
It'd burn like a son of a bitch.

29:16.094 --> 29:18.547
Okay, well, the way out is up that way.

29:21.313 --> 29:22.968
Last one there is a rotten turd.

29:33.705 --> 29:35.688
It's clear.

29:36.432 --> 29:37.690
Ready?

29:54.473 --> 29:56.426
Yes. Yes.

29:56.575 --> 29:58.911
Shut the door.

30:00.813 --> 30:02.573
That couldn't have gone any better.

30:05.504 --> 30:07.306
- Smoke.
- Whoa.

30:09.916 --> 30:11.350
Sure.

30:11.437 --> 30:13.482
Anyone else want
a celebratory cigarette?

30:13.602 --> 30:15.628
No, idiot, smoke.

30:19.352 --> 30:21.526
I do not expect you boys to recall

30:21.551 --> 30:24.560
the drought of 1929.

30:26.266 --> 30:28.747
It was a terrible time.

30:29.468 --> 30:33.006
Every blade of grass turned brown.

30:33.539 --> 30:38.050
The branches of the trees sagged
under the weight of the dust.

30:38.393 --> 30:41.579
Luckily for us,
the maintenance of the lawns

30:41.614 --> 30:45.009
has since been endowed
by an affluent alumnus.

30:45.298 --> 30:47.500
They are the face of this university.

30:49.762 --> 30:51.813
The fabric that ties the buildings

30:51.858 --> 30:55.539
of this institution
of science together.

30:56.796 --> 30:59.642
Walk us through the science
involved in rolling

30:59.667 --> 31:02.370
dinitrogen tetroxide across it.

31:02.581 --> 31:06.056
Or was it merely an act of vandalism?

31:07.459 --> 31:09.163
It is true that we have undertaken

31:09.188 --> 31:11.208
extraordinary measures,

31:11.794 --> 31:13.989
but it is the limitations imposed on us

31:14.014 --> 31:16.816
by this institution that
made those measures necessary.

31:16.841 --> 31:18.977
What limitations is he referring to?

31:19.380 --> 31:20.740
Based on their behavior,

31:20.765 --> 31:22.295
seems to me there haven't been enough.

31:22.320 --> 31:24.944
Professor Mesulam is the one who
brought our project onto campus.

31:24.992 --> 31:26.660
Are you questioning his judgment
in thinking

31:26.684 --> 31:28.463
our work had merit?

31:30.284 --> 31:33.279
Mr. Parsons, you are
a guest on this campus,

31:33.306 --> 31:35.808
which means your presence here
is far more tenuous

31:35.841 --> 31:37.043
than your peers'.

31:38.511 --> 31:41.447
As the so-called
"chemist" of the group,

31:41.527 --> 31:43.329
not to mention its mouthpiece,

31:43.754 --> 31:46.577
I assume this whole thing
was your idea.

31:47.907 --> 31:50.316
It was my idea, sir.

31:51.284 --> 31:53.986
Really, Mr. Onsted?

31:54.086 --> 31:56.555
You decided to bring in
outside chemicals

31:56.602 --> 31:59.349
from Mr. Parsons' place of employment?

31:59.452 --> 32:01.720
Yes, sir. It was our only choice.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.409
Running full-volume
tests was the only way

32:04.434 --> 32:06.669
to get the data that we needed
for the proposal.

32:06.719 --> 32:08.097
It's true.

32:08.146 --> 32:11.104
My work on the project
was at a standstill without it.

32:11.943 --> 32:13.312
And you, Mr. Gui?

32:13.627 --> 32:15.617
You were willing to sacrifice

32:15.717 --> 32:18.699
your standing in this university

32:18.766 --> 32:22.054
by agreeing to take part
in these shenanigans?

32:24.863 --> 32:26.899
I did not take part.

32:27.720 --> 32:31.304
But I understood the necessity of it.

32:32.838 --> 32:35.843
Be that as it may, Mr. Parsons,

32:36.043 --> 32:37.709
your influence on your colleagues

32:37.734 --> 32:39.669
has not gone unnoticed.

32:46.099 --> 32:47.700
I don't see what the big fuss is about,

32:47.725 --> 32:48.893
it's just grass.

32:50.052 --> 32:51.538
Didn't you hear them?

32:51.584 --> 32:54.086
The lawn has better funding than we do.

32:57.602 --> 33:01.494
I guess they'll never
let us in the Athenaeum now.

33:02.508 --> 33:04.763
Is that really what
you're worried about?

33:08.768 --> 33:11.838
Thank you, for what you did back there.

33:12.674 --> 33:15.374
And you... you could've
hung me out to dry.

33:15.580 --> 33:17.410
Yes, but you're

33:17.443 --> 33:18.866
an invaluable member to the team.

33:18.945 --> 33:20.994
We need at least one
person who's not scared

33:21.019 --> 33:22.614
of blowing themselves up.

33:23.121 --> 33:27.097
The committee has decided not
to terminate the project.

33:27.306 --> 33:30.381
On my request, they are
giving you probation instead.

33:32.664 --> 33:36.159
Mr. Parsons put me
in a difficult position.

33:36.722 --> 33:38.224
Admit I was idiot

33:38.249 --> 33:40.271
to bring you onto campus,

33:40.339 --> 33:42.743
or justify decision by giving you

33:42.768 --> 33:44.736
more time to prove yourself.

33:47.427 --> 33:51.264
Now, everything depends
on written proposal.

33:51.710 --> 33:53.840
If it fails to impress,

33:53.940 --> 33:55.787
you three will be reassigned

33:55.835 --> 33:57.303
to other projects.

33:58.172 --> 33:59.685
What about me?

33:59.718 --> 34:01.754
I don't know, Mr. Parsons.

34:11.128 --> 34:13.031
Just tell her the truth.

34:13.851 --> 34:16.120
She'll understand.

34:57.850 --> 34:59.912
You're leaving?

35:00.076 --> 35:01.770
Yes, it's after 5:00.

35:01.840 --> 35:03.776
There's still some outgoing calls.

35:04.700 --> 35:07.052
Do they need to be dealt with tonight?

35:07.422 --> 35:11.457
Well, they don't need to, but
I believe I made myself clear.

35:12.051 --> 35:13.615
About the terms of the loan?

35:13.640 --> 35:15.068
Mr. Gilroy called to inform me

35:15.093 --> 35:16.661
that my check had been deposited.

35:17.368 --> 35:18.985
Your check.

35:19.178 --> 35:22.122
As I said, you will need
to start working overtime

35:22.147 --> 35:24.710
until the principal's paid off.

35:34.453 --> 35:36.582
I'm proud of you, Susan.

35:36.679 --> 35:38.613
I'm sure Jack was

35:38.691 --> 35:42.348
resistant, but good sense prevailed.

35:42.914 --> 35:45.124
Now, I know it is close to dinner,

35:45.149 --> 35:47.118
but by making the calls now,

35:47.199 --> 35:49.821
you have a better chance of
catching our clients at home.

36:29.401 --> 36:31.637
Hey.

36:31.901 --> 36:34.574
I was wondering
when you'd be getting back.

36:35.020 --> 36:36.322
I knew you'd kept some of them,

36:36.347 --> 36:39.205
but I didn't know you'd held
onto all these letters.

36:40.025 --> 36:42.093
Why, Jack?

36:43.271 --> 36:45.312
The check.

36:45.511 --> 36:47.109
You said we wouldn't need it.

36:47.173 --> 36:50.357
We suffered a minor setback at Caltech.

36:51.468 --> 36:53.923
Things are going to take a
little longer than expected.

36:54.103 --> 36:55.639
I know you've been worried.

36:56.301 --> 36:57.521
Worried?

36:57.546 --> 37:00.152
Yeah, about the mortgage.

37:00.324 --> 37:02.759
Is that what you think
I've been worried about?

37:04.100 --> 37:05.593
I'm going to put these back.

37:06.011 --> 37:07.596
I thought this is what you wanted.

37:07.671 --> 37:09.640
Let go.

37:21.224 --> 37:24.193
How could you deposit it
without even talking to me?

37:25.009 --> 37:26.709
I thought there was
nothing to talk about.

37:26.734 --> 37:27.995
Nothing to talk about?

37:28.020 --> 37:29.682
I thought you'd be relieved.

37:35.316 --> 37:36.382
Susan.

37:36.407 --> 37:39.310
I was hoping you'd tell me
to rip the damn thing up.

37:39.435 --> 37:40.770
If you really have a position

37:40.795 --> 37:42.881
- lined up at Caltech, like...
- I will, I will.

37:42.906 --> 37:44.194
I just need more time.

37:44.219 --> 37:46.121
You will, or you do?

37:49.279 --> 37:51.495
The only way I can stomach
working for that man

37:51.528 --> 37:54.131
is knowing that someday
I won't have to.

37:54.321 --> 37:56.447
That you'll... that you'll take me away

37:56.492 --> 37:58.194
from all this like you promised.

37:59.270 --> 38:02.586
Every penny we take from him
only sinks me in deeper.

38:02.706 --> 38:04.073
But the house.

38:04.141 --> 38:06.109
It's not the house I'm worried about.

38:06.822 --> 38:09.379
It's whether this dream
of yours... of-of ours...

38:09.413 --> 38:11.148
Is really going to come true.

38:14.858 --> 38:16.582
What's all this?

38:16.774 --> 38:17.908
Nothing.

38:18.405 --> 38:20.646
Did you get the gift I left you?

38:20.984 --> 38:23.902
Yes.

38:24.214 --> 38:25.849
Thank you, you didn't have to do that.

38:25.887 --> 38:27.670
No, I wanted to.

38:27.764 --> 38:30.267
You want something bad enough,

38:30.735 --> 38:32.668
the world finds
a way to give it to you.

38:32.750 --> 38:34.552
Ernest, can you just give us a minute?

38:34.577 --> 38:37.045
My group is having
a gathering this evening,

38:37.245 --> 38:39.279
and I think maybe you two should come.

38:41.645 --> 38:43.368
What is it, exactly?

38:43.667 --> 38:45.669
Come see for yourself.

38:48.082 --> 38:50.527
What are you more scared of?

38:50.674 --> 38:54.477
Trying something new, or that this

38:55.204 --> 38:58.408
is all there is?

39:01.277 --> 39:02.679
Look, come or don't come, that's it.

39:02.703 --> 39:04.705
I'm not gonna ask you again.

39:07.738 --> 39:11.677
I have made a secret door
in the house of Ra and Tum.

39:12.476 --> 39:14.644
What?

39:15.369 --> 39:19.576
I have made a secret door
into the house of Ra and Tum.

39:19.683 --> 39:21.351
Remember.

39:34.231 --> 39:35.824
Do you want to go?

39:38.836 --> 39:40.604
Do you?

39:51.868 --> 39:54.170
I'm just surprised, that's all.

39:54.497 --> 39:56.209
Last time we talked about Ernest,

39:56.234 --> 39:58.060
you were calling the cops on him.

40:03.794 --> 40:05.561
Who knows? Maybe he's right.

40:05.629 --> 40:08.499
Maybe it'll help us.

40:08.626 --> 40:10.260
How?

40:11.555 --> 40:13.557
I don't know.

40:14.851 --> 40:17.688
But at least we'll find out together.

40:22.973 --> 40:25.313
Just know what you're walking into.

40:25.502 --> 40:27.680
These people are strange.

40:27.852 --> 40:29.454
They didn't seem so bad.

40:29.693 --> 40:31.395
They just seemed free.

40:31.443 --> 40:33.878
Yeah, that's one word for it.

40:45.862 --> 40:48.565
Anybody there?

40:51.489 --> 40:53.858
We're here for the gathering.

41:03.314 --> 41:07.551
I have made a secret door
into the house of Ra and Tum?

41:27.832 --> 41:29.972
We were invited by Ernest.

41:40.717 --> 41:42.719
The Parsons.

41:50.727 --> 41:53.030
So, should we just wait here?

42:11.669 --> 42:14.356
I wouldn't.

42:15.465 --> 42:17.501
Where is everyone?

42:19.022 --> 42:20.986
Save your breath.

42:21.185 --> 42:23.921
He's not gonna answer you.

42:47.224 --> 42:49.726
Do you want us to follow you?

42:53.496 --> 42:56.012
Are you sure about this?

43:13.783 --> 43:16.486
Who is that?

43:17.688 --> 43:19.657
No idea.

44:04.325 --> 44:05.508
Come.

44:05.556 --> 44:08.793
We have a place for you.

44:37.761 --> 44:38.881
Don't worry.

44:38.906 --> 44:41.408
She'll be taken care of.

45:02.527 --> 45:04.107
May you be granted the accomplishment

45:04.132 --> 45:06.668
of your true will.

45:11.402 --> 45:13.804
Welcome.

45:14.071 --> 45:17.808
Let the rituals rightly be
performed with joy and beauty.

45:33.550 --> 45:36.604
Infinite space.

45:37.841 --> 45:39.910
Before whom,

45:40.117 --> 45:43.494
time is ashamed.

45:43.640 --> 45:47.243
The mind, bewildered.

45:47.563 --> 45:50.236
The understanding, dark.

45:50.274 --> 45:54.609
I am alone.

45:54.845 --> 45:57.512
There is no God where I am.

45:57.601 --> 46:01.438
My name is chaos.

46:01.831 --> 46:06.909
I am the flame that burns
in every heart of man.

46:06.999 --> 46:10.064
I am life, the giver of life,

46:10.154 --> 46:12.114
therefore the knowledge of me

46:12.139 --> 46:15.876
is the knowledge of death.

46:20.704 --> 46:24.264
Do what thou wilt
shall be the whole of the law.

46:24.334 --> 46:25.635
Love is the law.

46:25.660 --> 46:27.337
Love under will.

46:29.286 --> 46:30.698
Be still.

46:30.888 --> 46:34.184
I, who am all pleasure, desire you.

46:36.666 --> 46:38.952
Inside us all

46:39.502 --> 46:41.271
is a star.

46:41.411 --> 46:44.314
They will divide and persecute us

46:44.594 --> 46:47.420
in order to conceal our light.

46:47.591 --> 46:51.128
But the man of will breaks

46:51.409 --> 46:53.464
all boundaries.

47:06.042 --> 47:07.536
Hey.

47:09.176 --> 47:10.393
You all right?

47:14.598 --> 47:16.994
Can we just go home?

47:33.076 --> 47:34.229
I tried to warn you.

47:34.254 --> 47:37.062
That wasn't just strange, it was sick.

47:37.895 --> 47:41.098
We left before we even got
to find out what it is.

47:42.621 --> 47:45.322
If I hadn't left,
would you have stayed?

48:10.821 --> 48:12.823
Susan.
