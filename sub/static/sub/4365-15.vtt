WEBVTT

00:01.285 --> 00:02.626
Sheila Amanda Sazs,

00:02.651 --> 00:04.005
will you marry me?

00:04.006 --> 00:06.041
Yes, I will marry you.

00:06.108 --> 00:07.309
- I want to go legit.
- You can't.

00:07.376 --> 00:09.244
Then I get Lola Jensen
to hack into the bar

00:09.312 --> 00:11.313
and just put me in there,
just like she did with Harvard.

00:11.380 --> 00:12.914
Rule number one
of not getting caught,

00:12.982 --> 00:14.516
you don't move
the goddamn body.

00:14.583 --> 00:16.384
Harvey, I'm stuck.

00:16.452 --> 00:18.620
I can't live my whole life
like this.

00:18.688 --> 00:20.655
You want me to set up
your new corporation?

00:20.723 --> 00:23.024
I want you to join
my new corporation.

00:23.092 --> 00:25.560
We're not lawyers.
We're investment bankers.

00:25.628 --> 00:27.529
Our job blows yours
out of the water.

00:27.596 --> 00:30.598
Scottie, I need you to give
Louis his transaction back.

00:30.666 --> 00:33.501
Does this have something to do
with that favor he did you?

00:33.569 --> 00:36.571
- Yes.
- Tell me what it is.

00:36.639 --> 00:37.839
- I can't.
- Guess we're not sharing

00:37.907 --> 00:39.507
everything with each other
after all.

00:39.575 --> 00:40.742
- Scottie.
- You can't have it

00:40.810 --> 00:42.243
both ways, Harvey.

00:42.311 --> 00:44.579
- Louis, I don't want kids.
- What are you talking about?

00:44.647 --> 00:46.114
I don't like kids.

00:46.182 --> 00:49.017
I was willing to give up Harvard
for you.

00:49.085 --> 00:51.453
You can't give up something
for me?

00:57.927 --> 01:00.395
I understand.
Can I just say something please?

01:00.463 --> 01:04.666
I know you keep saying that
I won't feel this way forever,

01:04.733 --> 01:07.902
but why is it
when the guys shows up

01:07.970 --> 01:09.671
with chicken vindaloo
40 minutes late

01:09.739 --> 01:12.674
with no naan
and no silverware,

01:12.742 --> 01:14.709
instead of throwing the chutney
in his face,

01:14.777 --> 01:17.679
I'm thanking him
and I am tipping him $20?

01:17.747 --> 01:21.783
Do you want to tell me
why that happens?

01:21.851 --> 01:24.352
I don't care.
I hate myself.

01:24.420 --> 01:26.187
I hate my life.

01:26.255 --> 01:28.456
The woman I love is gone,
my heart is broken,

01:28.524 --> 01:29.991
and I really--
to be honest with you,

01:30.059 --> 01:31.826
I just don't have
the will to live.

01:31.894 --> 01:34.863
[Beeps]

01:34.930 --> 01:37.699
Hold on.
It's my associate.

01:37.767 --> 01:38.767
Katrina.

01:38.834 --> 01:40.769
Louis, it's 7:55.

01:40.836 --> 01:42.170
Yeah.
I have an 8:00 a.m.

01:42.238 --> 01:44.706
Please cover it for me.
In fact, cover everything,

01:44.774 --> 01:46.941
and unless the building
is on fire and Sheila's in it,

01:47.009 --> 01:48.843
I'm not coming in.
Louis, what happened?

01:48.911 --> 01:50.044
You wanna know what happened?
I'll tell you what happened.

01:50.112 --> 01:51.212
My heart's been shattered

01:51.280 --> 01:52.520
into a thousand million pieces,

01:52.581 --> 01:54.015
and if I can't put my heart
into my work,

01:54.083 --> 01:56.418
then I'm not gonna do
any work at all, so...

01:56.485 --> 01:58.253
How long do you think
you'll be out?

01:58.320 --> 01:59.854
I don't know.
Today, tomorrow,

01:59.922 --> 02:01.356
the rest of the year.

02:01.424 --> 02:02.624
You know,
just don't call here again

02:02.691 --> 02:05.827
because I'm not gonna answer
the number.

02:05.895 --> 02:08.596
Doc?

02:08.663 --> 02:11.199
Dr. Lipschitz?

02:11.267 --> 02:13.835
Hello?

02:13.903 --> 02:16.838
What, are you shitting me?
That was not 50 minutes.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:31.020 --> 02:33.688
Waiting outside for me?
Bold gesture.

02:33.756 --> 02:36.090
I called you three times.
I had to do something.

02:36.158 --> 02:38.293
- You must be feeling bad.
- I am.

02:38.360 --> 02:42.497
What for?
You're just doing your job.

02:42.565 --> 02:44.999
Scottie, I'm sorry.

02:45.067 --> 02:47.702
What happened with Louis,
I didn't like doing it.

02:47.770 --> 02:49.904
- Yeah, but you still did it.
- And what I'm doing now

02:49.972 --> 02:51.539
is asking you to let it go.

02:51.607 --> 02:53.308
Harvey, it's not that you
picked Louis over me.

02:53.375 --> 02:54.742
It's that you wouldn't
tell me why.

02:54.810 --> 02:57.645
I couldn't tell you why.
There's a difference.

02:57.713 --> 03:02.917
And I'm asking you
to trust me.

03:02.985 --> 03:05.487
Okay.

03:05.554 --> 03:08.556
I can let it go,
but keeping things from me

03:08.624 --> 03:12.360
just can't keep happening,
okay?

03:12.428 --> 03:14.496
I can't tell you
whether or not that's okay,

03:14.563 --> 03:19.200
and I definitely
can't tell you why.

03:19.268 --> 03:20.935
Too soon?

03:21.003 --> 03:22.637
What are you going to do
to make it up to me?

03:22.705 --> 03:24.172
Nothing right now.

03:24.240 --> 03:26.674
I'm taking Mike
to the marathon footwear brunch.

03:26.742 --> 03:28.303
You're taking a date
to an I.P.O. event?

03:28.344 --> 03:29.911
That's so cute.
It's not a date.

03:29.979 --> 03:31.346
He's never gonna put out.

03:31.413 --> 03:32.747
Well, it's too bad
that you're not taking me

03:32.815 --> 03:35.650
because I was thinking
of letting you...

03:35.718 --> 03:38.653
[Whispers indistinctly]

03:43.926 --> 03:46.928
Mr. Specter.

03:46.996 --> 03:48.329
James Quelling.

03:48.397 --> 03:50.198
I'm in a bit of a hurry,
Mr. quelling.

03:50.266 --> 03:52.700
- I want to do you a favor.
- I don't need any favors.

03:52.768 --> 03:55.537
Yeah, you do, unless you want
Friday's headline to read,

03:55.604 --> 03:58.540
"Marathon Footwear builds
playgrounds that kill children."

03:58.607 --> 04:00.341
My client builds playgrounds
that help children.

04:00.409 --> 04:03.444
And uses a synthetic
full of toxins to do it.

04:03.512 --> 04:05.547
Look, I don't know
who you are,

04:05.614 --> 04:08.014
but I know what you're trying
to do, and it isn't gonna work.

04:08.017 --> 04:09.450
Look,
I'm a reasonable man.

04:09.518 --> 04:11.419
This is a huge moment
for your client.

04:11.487 --> 04:13.621
I won't file this
before Friday.

04:13.689 --> 04:15.990
You think I'm gonna let you
extort my client?

04:16.058 --> 04:18.593
No, I think you're gonna
protect your client

04:18.661 --> 04:20.461
from a claim
that could ruin them.

04:20.529 --> 04:25.567
In fact,
I'm counting on it.

04:25.634 --> 04:27.902
Nice offices.
Enjoy that brunch.

04:30.072 --> 04:32.740
- I got a job offer.
- Holy shit. From who?

04:32.808 --> 04:34.375
Last night.
Jonathan Sidwell.

04:34.443 --> 04:36.377
But I thought Louis
was his lawyer.

04:36.445 --> 04:38.513
He doesn't want me
to be his lawyer.

04:38.581 --> 04:42.183
He wants me to be a partner.

04:42.251 --> 04:44.352
- Investment banking?
- Yeah.

04:44.420 --> 04:45.720
- And?
- I don't know.

04:45.788 --> 04:46.988
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

04:47.056 --> 04:49.724
What do you think?
I think that I love you,

04:49.792 --> 04:53.695
and what you want to do
is what I want you to do.

04:53.762 --> 04:55.763
I don't know what to do.

04:55.831 --> 04:58.299
Okay.
Did you talk to Harvey?

04:58.367 --> 05:00.168
If I do that,
all he'll hear is, "Hey, Harvey,

05:00.169 --> 05:01.302
"thanks for doing everything
for me.

05:01.370 --> 05:03.137
I'm thinking about quitting."
Well...

05:03.205 --> 05:04.639
No, but you said
that you don't think of him

05:04.707 --> 05:06.474
as just your boss.
You consider him a friend.

05:06.542 --> 05:08.543
- So?
- So if he can't have

05:08.611 --> 05:11.813
an honest conversation with
your best interests in mind,

05:11.880 --> 05:15.717
he's not your friend, and--
and he shouldn't be your boss.

05:52.664 --> 05:54.045
I have to talk to you
about something.

05:54.046 --> 05:57.481
Well, unless its value
is in excess of $575 million,

05:57.549 --> 05:58.683
it can wait.

05:58.750 --> 06:00.051
Yeah.
Yeah, it can wait.

06:00.118 --> 06:02.386
Good because our I.P.O.
is in jeopardy

06:02.454 --> 06:04.889
unless we can deal
with this.

06:04.956 --> 06:07.692
Endangering children?
Wait, these things just opened.

06:07.759 --> 06:09.226
This is a bullshit claim.

06:09.294 --> 06:10.695
Maybe, but a bullshit claim

06:10.762 --> 06:13.282
on the right day is better than
a great claim on a bullshit day.

06:13.298 --> 06:15.132
Did you come up with that
all by yourself?

06:15.200 --> 06:17.334
My grandmother
taught it to me.

06:17.402 --> 06:19.103
- What do you need me to do?
- I need you to find

06:19.171 --> 06:21.211
everything there is to know
about this quelling guy.

06:21.273 --> 06:24.175
Harvey, why don't you
just pay him off?

06:24.242 --> 06:25.309
Protect the I.P.O.?

06:25.377 --> 06:26.811
I worked my ass off
for this day.

06:26.878 --> 06:28.878
He's trying to hijack it.
I'm not gonna be extorted

06:28.914 --> 06:30.314
by some piece of shit
I've never heard of.

06:30.382 --> 06:32.616
Okay. On it.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.552
Jessica.

06:34.619 --> 06:36.253
Donna,
what can I do for you?

06:36.321 --> 06:37.988
I was just walking
by reception,

06:38.056 --> 06:39.523
and I thought you might
like to know--you know,

06:39.591 --> 06:41.292
because it's your firm and--
Donna, get to it.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.728
Charles Van Dyke
is in the lobby.

06:43.795 --> 06:46.197
- Right now?
- 30 seconds ago.

06:46.264 --> 06:47.398
You were right
to come to me.

06:47.466 --> 06:48.733
Would you like me
to send him on his way?

06:48.800 --> 06:50.868
I prefer to take care
of Charles van dyke myself.

06:50.936 --> 06:52.870
Excellent.

06:56.808 --> 06:59.477
You can stare at it
all you want, Charles,

06:59.544 --> 07:01.045
but it's not going to change.

07:01.113 --> 07:02.346
I was just thinking,

07:02.414 --> 07:04.648
"I can't believe you put
the mailroom boy's name

07:04.716 --> 07:06.250
on the wall."
I think what you mean is

07:06.318 --> 07:08.452
that you can't believe
yours was ever taken off.

07:08.520 --> 07:09.954
I put that behind me
years ago.

07:10.021 --> 07:11.301
What are you doing here,
Charles?

07:11.323 --> 07:14.992
I suggest we go
in your office and talk.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.995
Right here is just fine.

07:18.063 --> 07:19.230
What do you want?

07:19.297 --> 07:21.499
I want a 30% increase
in my dividend check.

07:21.566 --> 07:24.668
- Good-bye, Charles.
- I thought you'd say that.

07:24.736 --> 07:27.238
This is formal notice of
my demand to audit your books.

07:27.305 --> 07:29.406
You have until Friday
to comply.

07:29.474 --> 07:32.343
You gave up this right
when we ran you out of town.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.845
I think you're forgetting
I retain that right

07:34.913 --> 07:37.848
in the event of any
material change in my dividend.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.483
Your dividend went up.

07:39.551 --> 07:43.420
Materially.

07:43.488 --> 07:45.256
You think
we're hiding profits.

07:45.323 --> 07:48.492
From what I know of you,
you're always hiding something.

07:50.796 --> 07:53.464
- I'm gonna make it fast, Jim.
- James.

07:53.532 --> 07:54.832
That's not what your ex-wife
calls you.

07:54.900 --> 07:56.000
She calls you Jim.

07:56.067 --> 07:57.968
That's one of the nicer names
she uses.

07:58.036 --> 08:00.004
She's been calling you
a lot these days.

08:00.071 --> 08:01.872
Wow, you found out
I'm divorced.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.741
Well, I'll withdraw
the lawsuit.

08:03.809 --> 08:05.976
It's not the divorce, Jimbo,
it's the huge wall

08:06.044 --> 08:08.379
of mounting debt
that's closing in on you

08:08.446 --> 08:10.181
since you tanked
the tobacco litigation.

08:10.248 --> 08:12.082
I didn't tank it.
I lost.

08:12.150 --> 08:13.417
You didn't just lose.

08:13.485 --> 08:15.286
You had an offer that
would have set you up for life.

08:15.353 --> 08:17.221
Instead, you rolled the dice,
went to verdict,

08:17.289 --> 08:18.589
and now you got nothing.

08:18.657 --> 08:20.257
Which is why your wife
left you,

08:20.325 --> 08:23.327
and now you're coming after us
with a fabricated claim.

08:23.395 --> 08:25.796
I didn't fabricate anything.
I have expert reports here.

08:25.864 --> 08:28.399
You've got one report
of possible toxins

08:28.466 --> 08:30.734
in the playground material.
And not one sick child.

08:30.802 --> 08:32.703
And you have an I.P.O.
on Friday,

08:32.770 --> 08:34.871
and if this suit appears
in the <i>Journal</i> that morning,

08:34.940 --> 08:36.340
what do you think
the stock price is gonna be

08:36.408 --> 08:40.510
when they ring that bell?

08:40.578 --> 08:42.980
Got me.
Give me your number.

08:43.048 --> 08:46.617
- 100,000 and we're done.
- Done.

08:46.685 --> 08:50.120
We'll draw up the paperwork.
I've got it right here.

08:50.188 --> 08:52.523
But one thing,
this precludes you

08:52.591 --> 08:56.293
from representing any other
plaintiffs with the same action.

08:56.361 --> 09:00.464
[Laughs]
You got me.

09:00.532 --> 09:02.766
I have 100 other plaintiffs
waiting in the wings.

09:02.834 --> 09:05.870
That's a $10 million hit
you just avoided.

09:05.937 --> 09:07.104
I tell you what.

09:07.172 --> 09:09.273
Give me a million,
and we're really done.

09:09.341 --> 09:12.476
James, this covers your debts
and gets you out from under.

09:15.981 --> 09:18.515
You think that means I'm gonna
take less than it's worth?

09:18.583 --> 09:21.652
- It isn't worth anything.
- It is today.

09:21.720 --> 09:24.655
You know where to reach me.

09:27.125 --> 09:28.259
Thought you said
you were willing to go

09:28.326 --> 09:30.094
as high as 500,000.
Yeah, that was before

09:30.161 --> 09:32.463
I realized
what we were dealing with.

09:32.530 --> 09:35.699
This guy doesn't owe money
'cause he got divorced.

09:35.767 --> 09:37.234
He got divorced
'cause he owes money.

09:37.302 --> 09:39.143
- What are you talking about?
- He's a gambler.

09:39.204 --> 09:40.738
How does that help us?

09:40.805 --> 09:42.740
He doesn't know I'm one.

09:49.881 --> 09:51.682
Where's Louis?

09:51.750 --> 09:53.417
- Jessica.
- Where is he?

09:53.485 --> 09:56.887
He's not answering his phone.
He's not answering his emails.

09:56.955 --> 09:58.555
The thing is
I don't know if he--

09:58.623 --> 10:01.525
Katrina,
your job as gatekeeper

10:01.593 --> 10:04.028
does not apply to me,
so I'm going to ask you

10:04.095 --> 10:05.095
one more time.

10:05.163 --> 10:08.098
Why isn't Louis
in the building?

10:08.166 --> 10:09.400
He must still be in court.

10:09.467 --> 10:11.669
Is there something I can do?
What you can do

10:11.736 --> 10:13.837
is find Louis and have him
come up with a way around

10:13.905 --> 10:15.940
this demand
to look at our books.

10:16.007 --> 10:17.368
When should I tell him
you need it?

10:17.409 --> 10:20.778
Yesterday.

10:20.845 --> 10:23.480
You were right.
Quelling's got a game.

10:23.548 --> 10:25.816
- What night?
- Every night.

10:25.884 --> 10:28.045
Well, I hope you know where
tonight's game is because--

10:31.589 --> 10:32.756
- Great.
- Mm-hmm.

10:32.824 --> 10:36.160
You and I are going.

10:36.227 --> 10:38.595
- Um...
- What?

10:43.168 --> 10:45.836
I got a job offer,
Harvey.

10:45.904 --> 10:48.339
Supposed to go have drinks
to talk about it tonight.

10:48.406 --> 10:51.075
I can move it,
it's just, that's...

10:51.142 --> 10:54.378
that's why I hesitated.

10:54.446 --> 10:56.513
- When?
- When what?

10:56.581 --> 10:57.848
When'd you get
the job offer?

10:57.916 --> 10:59.757
- The other night.
- And you didn't mention it.

10:59.818 --> 11:00.818
I didn't know
what I thought.

11:00.885 --> 11:02.486
- And now you do?
- No. It's--

11:02.554 --> 11:05.756
Who?

11:05.824 --> 11:08.125
Jonathan Sidwell.

11:08.193 --> 11:09.293
The spin-off idea?

11:09.361 --> 11:10.894
- Yeah.
- I should have known.

11:10.962 --> 11:12.830
He wants you to be
his general counsel?

11:12.897 --> 11:17.201
No, he wants to make me
an investment banker.

11:17.268 --> 11:22.639
Well, if it were me...
I'd take it.

11:22.707 --> 11:25.709
What? Why?

11:25.777 --> 11:27.611
Because you can compete there
like you do here

11:27.679 --> 11:29.380
with nothing hanging
over your head.

11:29.447 --> 11:30.914
What if I don't want to stop
being a lawyer?

11:30.982 --> 11:32.142
Well, then don't
take the job.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.450
I mean, what do you want
from me?

11:33.518 --> 11:35.119
- I want your advice.
- I just gave you my advice.

11:35.186 --> 11:37.788
No, you told me
what you would do.

11:37.856 --> 11:39.790
I want to know what you think
I should do.

11:39.858 --> 11:42.359
Mike, last week,
you said you'd do anything

11:42.427 --> 11:47.464
to stop being a fraud,
so my advice is take it.

11:47.532 --> 11:50.267
Still be in the majors,
just be a different sport.

11:54.005 --> 11:55.939
[Clears throat]

12:00.362 --> 12:02.336
Excuse me,
do you have a minute?

12:04.055 --> 12:05.856
Look, you and I have never--

12:05.924 --> 12:08.659
No, we haven't.

12:08.726 --> 12:09.893
I need your help.

12:09.961 --> 12:11.728
You must be scraping
the bottom of the barrel

12:11.796 --> 12:13.830
if you're coming to me.
It's about Louis.

12:13.898 --> 12:17.134
He and Sheila are done.
That's awful.

12:17.201 --> 12:18.969
It's worse than awful.

12:19.037 --> 12:20.771
Jessica needs him on a case
right now.

12:20.838 --> 12:23.407
He won't leave his apartment.
He won't even answer his phone.

12:23.474 --> 12:24.408
Then I'll just go over there
right now.

12:24.475 --> 12:25.709
That won't work.

12:25.777 --> 12:27.544
Even if it did,
we don't have time.

12:27.612 --> 12:30.581
So then why are you here?

12:30.648 --> 12:31.729
Rachel, you don't trust me.

12:31.783 --> 12:35.352
I get that,
but Louis asked me

12:35.420 --> 12:38.055
to cover for him, and that
is what I'm going to do.

12:38.122 --> 12:43.327
You're the best paralegal here,
and you're his friend.

12:43.394 --> 12:46.697
So will you help me or not?
I will.

12:49.567 --> 12:53.170
So...I figured out
what you can do

12:53.237 --> 12:55.172
to make it up to me tonight.

12:55.239 --> 12:56.673
I thought we were good.

12:56.741 --> 13:00.243
Yeah, I'm just--I'm feeling
some residual anger.

13:00.311 --> 13:02.079
Scottie, I'm kind of busy
right now,

13:02.146 --> 13:03.280
and I have plans tonight.

13:03.348 --> 13:05.015
Taking Mike
on another I.P.O. date?

13:05.083 --> 13:06.683
- What difference does it make?
- Hmm.

13:06.751 --> 13:07.784
Sounds mysterious.

13:07.852 --> 13:09.519
Bet you can't tell me
what it is.

13:09.587 --> 13:11.655
- I'm playing poker.
- Poker?

13:11.723 --> 13:14.257
Can I come?
It's a work thing.

13:14.325 --> 13:16.526
- You bring Mike to work things.
- Scottie, I told you I'm busy.

13:16.594 --> 13:19.262
You can't come.
Can I get back to work now?

13:19.330 --> 13:21.198
- What got io you?
- Nothing.

13:21.265 --> 13:24.968
Sometimes at the office,
I'm working.

13:25.036 --> 13:28.105
Fair enough, boss.

13:36.247 --> 13:38.048
Are you sure that's how
you want to play that?

13:38.049 --> 13:40.017
Play what,
the fact that I'm busy?

13:40.084 --> 13:41.652
The fact that you
just snapped at her

13:41.719 --> 13:43.453
when we both know what
you're really angry about.

13:43.521 --> 13:46.690
I'm not angry.
I'm annoyed at the interruption.

13:46.758 --> 13:48.238
You're angry
that Mike wants to leave,

13:48.259 --> 13:49.526
and you just
took it out on her.

13:49.594 --> 13:52.295
- I'm not angry about that.
- No, you're hurt,

13:52.363 --> 13:56.500
and the anger covers the hurt,
but I knew you didn't know that.

13:56.567 --> 13:58.935
I was annoyed
about the interruption

13:59.003 --> 14:01.438
just like I'm annoyed right now.
Bullshit.

14:01.506 --> 14:03.340
You're feeling
exactly what I'm feeling.

14:03.408 --> 14:05.609
The idea of Mike leaving sucks,

14:05.677 --> 14:07.144
and the sooner you get
your brain around that,

14:07.211 --> 14:10.647
the sooner you can maybe
do something about it.

14:10.715 --> 14:12.015
Can I get back to work now?

14:12.083 --> 14:14.851
You can get back to work
whenever you want.

14:14.919 --> 14:17.020
But if all you're gonna do
is stick your head in the sand,

14:17.088 --> 14:19.189
then you're not going to have
an associate or a girlfriend

14:19.257 --> 14:23.927
to get back to work from.

14:23.995 --> 14:26.129
- You give it to her?
- I gave it to her.

14:26.197 --> 14:27.731
She suspect anything?

14:27.799 --> 14:30.834
I wouldn't be standing here
if she did.

14:30.902 --> 14:33.770
- And?
- She thought it was awesome.

14:33.838 --> 14:35.272
Well, she should.

14:35.339 --> 14:36.873
Louis didn't just
come up with a way

14:36.941 --> 14:39.009
to keep Charles Van Dyke
out of our books.

14:39.077 --> 14:42.913
Louis came up with a way
to blow him out of the water.

14:42.980 --> 14:46.883
That Louis.
He is one hell of an attorney.

14:46.951 --> 14:50.887
- Thank you, Louis.
- Right back at you, Louis.

14:55.660 --> 14:57.461
Don't get used to it.

14:57.528 --> 14:58.862
Don't worry.

14:58.930 --> 15:00.497
I'm not looking
to work here again.

15:00.565 --> 15:02.432
Not here,
but you are looking to work?

15:02.500 --> 15:06.303
I've always been able to see
through your bullshit, Charles.

15:06.370 --> 15:11.208
Which is why I'm offering you
these, five cases.

15:11.275 --> 15:14.344
We're co-counsel,
split the profits 50/50.

15:14.412 --> 15:17.013
It announces to the world
that you are back in business,

15:17.081 --> 15:18.648
which is what you really want.

15:18.716 --> 15:22.519
You came to me
bearing gifts.

15:22.587 --> 15:23.754
I still have the card.

15:23.821 --> 15:28.158
"To the man who hired me
for all you've done."

15:28.226 --> 15:30.460
Two days later,
you shoved me out.

15:30.528 --> 15:33.597
I take this to mean
you're passing on my offer.

15:33.664 --> 15:35.031
I'm shitting on your offer.

15:35.099 --> 15:36.967
Okay, Charles.
You were right.

15:37.034 --> 15:40.804
Your dividend check did have
the wrong amount,

15:40.872 --> 15:41.972
but from now on,
it's going to have

15:42.039 --> 15:44.107
the right amount, zero.

15:44.175 --> 15:46.076
- I don't think so.
- Oh, the firm

15:46.144 --> 15:51.081
you had your exit agreement with
no longer exists.

15:51.149 --> 15:53.917
We became Pearson Darby,
then Pearson Specter,

15:53.985 --> 15:57.187
which means
you're not entitled to a thing.

15:57.255 --> 15:59.289
That's not in the spirit
of our agreement.

15:59.357 --> 16:02.058
And neither is your claim.

16:02.126 --> 16:04.027
There's only one problem.

16:04.095 --> 16:06.329
You should have dug deeper
into the fine print.

16:06.397 --> 16:08.131
The entity referred to
in our agreement

16:08.199 --> 16:10.634
is defined in your bylaws
as "any partnership

16:10.701 --> 16:15.405
in which the name partner
is Jessica Pearson."

16:15.473 --> 16:18.175
You didn't know.

16:18.242 --> 16:21.144
My number just tripled.

16:21.212 --> 16:23.280
Your call.

16:23.347 --> 16:26.216
Our hearing is Friday.

16:44.969 --> 16:47.971
You guys playing cards?

16:48.039 --> 16:51.041
You're out of your league.
This game is for real players.

16:51.108 --> 16:54.177
Why don't I give it a try?

16:54.245 --> 16:56.246
Buyin is 25,000.

16:56.314 --> 16:59.749
- What's the limit?
- There is no limit.

16:59.817 --> 17:02.953
Maybe I am out of my league.

17:12.063 --> 17:16.132
Raise $45,000.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.635
I'm putting you all-in.

17:18.703 --> 17:20.403
I've seen guys like you
before.

17:20.471 --> 17:22.873
You think if you bully me
with your big stack,

17:22.940 --> 17:24.674
I'm gonna run and hide.

17:24.742 --> 17:27.577
Here's the difference
between you and me, Jimbo,

17:27.645 --> 17:31.014
I lose,
I pull out another 25 grand,

17:31.082 --> 17:32.582
and another 25 after that.

17:32.650 --> 17:35.886
You lose,
you've got nothing.

17:35.953 --> 17:37.520
You're bluffing.

17:37.588 --> 17:40.857
Then call
or get up and walk away,

17:40.925 --> 17:45.362
but I've sat across from you
1,000 times before.

17:45.429 --> 17:47.430
You won't walk.

18:11.756 --> 18:13.123
Tough beat.

18:13.190 --> 18:15.058
Take your winnings.

18:15.126 --> 18:16.927
What winnings?

18:21.198 --> 18:23.934
I thought maybe it was time
we do a little negotiating.

18:24.001 --> 18:25.468
Well, you have my offer.

18:25.536 --> 18:27.103
- I have a counter.
- I'm all ears.

18:27.171 --> 18:29.072
I want a 50% increase
in base salary.

18:29.140 --> 18:32.542
I want a guaranteed bonus not
tied to our investment returns,

18:32.610 --> 18:37.280
a four-week vacation,
and I want a piece.

18:37.348 --> 18:39.816
- A piece?
- A piece.

18:39.884 --> 18:42.986
- No.
- No piece?

18:43.054 --> 18:46.890
No negotiating.
Look, I know what you're doing.

18:46.958 --> 18:47.991
You can't make up your mind,

18:48.059 --> 18:49.893
so you want me
to make it up for you.

18:49.961 --> 18:52.041
But I don't want someone
who's with me for the money.

18:52.063 --> 18:53.330
I want someone who's with me

18:53.397 --> 18:54.531
'cause they want to kick
some ass.

18:54.598 --> 18:56.099
- I do kick ass.
- And if you want to take

18:56.167 --> 19:01.071
this job right now,
I will negotiate in good faith.

19:01.138 --> 19:05.208
But you don't.

19:05.276 --> 19:07.444
I don't yet.

19:07.511 --> 19:10.447
[Clears throat]

19:10.514 --> 19:12.148
Starting tomorrow,

19:12.216 --> 19:13.817
I'll be interviewing
other people.

19:13.884 --> 19:19.289
Once I find the right person,
job is gone.

19:22.994 --> 19:26.096
I'm not dropping my suit when
you're going public in two days.

19:26.163 --> 19:28.999
James, you've read
all about Hessington Oil.

19:29.066 --> 19:31.001
The odds were stacked
against me.

19:31.068 --> 19:34.571
I won anyway, because I win.

19:34.638 --> 19:36.840
You won because Edward Darby
came forward.

19:36.907 --> 19:38.174
You got lucky.

19:38.242 --> 19:41.277
Guys like you always think
other people get lucky.

19:41.345 --> 19:43.313
I don't get lucky.

19:43.381 --> 19:44.814
I make my own luck,

19:44.882 --> 19:47.984
and in this case,
it's bleeding you dry.

19:48.052 --> 19:49.886
Right there.

19:49.954 --> 19:53.823
You just gave me your tell.
You have no other money.

19:53.891 --> 19:58.428
You're done.
There's $100,000 in that pile.

19:58.496 --> 20:01.865
It's the exact amount
of the deal we offered you.

20:01.932 --> 20:04.300
Sign it.

20:04.368 --> 20:07.670
We'll fix the paperwork
tomorrow.

20:10.374 --> 20:14.511
This is $1,000.
Cash me out.

20:14.578 --> 20:16.980
He doesn't play anymore
the rest of the night.

20:27.411 --> 20:29.879
You didn't sleep well.

20:29.947 --> 20:31.714
I didn't sleep at all.

20:31.782 --> 20:34.517
It's a big decision.

20:34.585 --> 20:36.453
You still haven't told me
what you think.

20:36.520 --> 20:38.822
Mike, I can't make
the decision for you.

20:38.889 --> 20:40.323
I don't want you
to make it for me.

20:40.391 --> 20:41.958
I just want to know
what you think.

20:42.026 --> 20:43.593
And I already told you
that I will support you

20:43.661 --> 20:45.595
with whatever you decide.
And the way you can support me

20:45.663 --> 20:48.865
right now is by telling me
how you feel.

20:48.933 --> 20:52.035
- It's not my place.
- Not your place?

20:52.103 --> 20:53.369
Just admit it.
You want me to take the job,

20:53.437 --> 20:54.677
but you're too afraid
to say it.

20:54.705 --> 20:55.985
Okay, you want to know
the truth?

20:56.040 --> 20:57.740
You already know
what you want to do.

20:57.808 --> 21:01.111
And if I try to change your mind
and it goes wrong,

21:01.178 --> 21:03.058
then I'm afraid
you're gonna hold it against me.

21:03.080 --> 21:05.081
Would you just say it?

21:05.149 --> 21:08.651
Yes.
I want you to take the job.

21:10.821 --> 21:14.157
Look, I know that you love
what you do,

21:14.225 --> 21:16.265
but every day, you go into work
with the possibility

21:16.293 --> 21:20.396
of being caught,
and it is eating away at you.

21:20.464 --> 21:25.702
If you stay there,
that's just not gonna change.

21:30.107 --> 21:33.042
- Jessica. How did--
- It go?

21:33.110 --> 21:37.113
I'll tell you how it went.
I got hung out to dry.

21:37.181 --> 21:38.948
What?
No, it was a good move.

21:39.016 --> 21:40.183
Oh, it would have been

21:40.251 --> 21:42.218
if our own bylaws
didn't supersede it.

21:42.286 --> 21:43.887
Th--that's impossible.

21:43.954 --> 21:46.356
It was convoluted
and buried in the fine print,

21:46.423 --> 21:49.526
and something Louis Litt
never would have missed.

21:49.593 --> 21:52.662
Look me in the eye
and tell me I'm wrong.

21:52.730 --> 21:55.131
You're not.
He wouldn't have missed it.

21:55.199 --> 21:57.500
So when you came
into my office

21:57.568 --> 21:59.602
and told me Louis
had come up with that move,

21:59.670 --> 22:03.940
you were full of shit.

22:04.008 --> 22:07.577
I'm sorry.
I wanted to help.

22:07.645 --> 22:09.325
Well, that kind of thing
only happens once.

22:09.346 --> 22:13.049
You know how I know
it's not gonna happen again?

22:13.117 --> 22:15.752
Pack up your shit.

22:15.819 --> 22:19.789
I don't care what kind of deal
you have with Harvey.

22:19.857 --> 22:21.791
You're done.

22:28.032 --> 22:29.732
Why wouldn't you tell her?

22:29.800 --> 22:32.101
I said I would cover.

22:32.169 --> 22:34.604
I didn't say I would cover
when it suited me.

22:34.672 --> 22:37.240
Yeah, but he wouldn't want you
to get fired over this.

22:37.308 --> 22:40.076
I should be fired.
I let Jessica look stupid.

22:40.144 --> 22:41.110
Katrina--

22:41.178 --> 22:42.679
Thank you for your help,
Rachel.

22:42.746 --> 22:44.080
I really appreciate it,

22:44.148 --> 22:46.149
but if you don't mind,
I'd like to be alone.

23:09.640 --> 23:13.209
He's not here.

23:13.277 --> 23:15.078
Where is he?

23:15.145 --> 23:16.279
To tell you the truth,
I don't know.

23:16.347 --> 23:18.014
All he said was he had
a late night.

23:18.082 --> 23:21.117
Hmm.
Well, I can come back.

23:21.185 --> 23:22.151
- I was just--
- You're taking the job,

23:22.219 --> 23:24.954
aren't you?

23:25.022 --> 23:26.055
I don't know.

23:26.123 --> 23:27.890
Yeah, you do.

23:27.958 --> 23:31.894
You just don't want
to admit it.

23:31.962 --> 23:34.564
[Sighs]

23:34.632 --> 23:37.567
Yeah.
I'm taking the job.

23:37.635 --> 23:40.803
[Sighs]

23:40.871 --> 23:43.806
God damn it.

23:47.945 --> 23:51.581
Do you know what that man
has done for you?

23:51.649 --> 23:54.050
Do you know what it took for him
to start trusting someone?

23:54.118 --> 23:56.219
- Donna--
- Don't interrupt me.

23:56.287 --> 23:57.754
So someone's dangling some money
in front of you.

23:57.821 --> 24:00.256
- It's not about that.
- I don't care what it's about.

24:00.324 --> 24:02.959
I'm gonna say what he won't.

24:03.027 --> 24:04.360
He needs you.

24:04.428 --> 24:06.562
You need this job,
and if you can't see that,

24:06.630 --> 24:07.930
then you might as well
just leave right now.

24:07.998 --> 24:11.234
Donna, someone's offering me
a way out.

24:11.302 --> 24:13.569
- So you don't care about him.
- Of course I do,

24:13.637 --> 24:16.172
but I also care about my life
with Rachel.

24:21.612 --> 24:23.746
I don't want to live my life
like this anymore.

24:34.224 --> 24:36.693
Then you better be the best
goddamn investment banker

24:36.760 --> 24:39.629
this city has ever seen.

24:50.274 --> 24:53.009
Scottie, I'm sorry
I was angry in your direction,

24:53.077 --> 24:54.711
but it was really
about something else.

24:54.778 --> 24:57.180
Let me guess, Donna explained
your feelings to you,

24:57.247 --> 24:58.648
and now you're here
to apologize.

24:58.716 --> 25:00.983
Maybe.

25:01.051 --> 25:03.219
What was the something else?

25:03.287 --> 25:05.788
Mike got a job offer.

25:05.856 --> 25:07.357
And you don't want him
to do it.

25:07.424 --> 25:08.358
No, I don't.

25:08.425 --> 25:09.892
Well, if you want him to stay,

25:09.960 --> 25:12.428
you know what's actually
a nice tactic?

25:12.496 --> 25:15.398
Telling him
you want him to stay.

25:17.334 --> 25:18.835
What?

25:18.902 --> 25:20.703
Had I known "tell me
what's going on with you"

25:20.771 --> 25:22.372
meant "I'm going to tell you
what to do,"

25:22.373 --> 25:23.840
I might not have
taken you up on it.

25:23.907 --> 25:26.309
Oh, okay. [Laughs]
Mmm.

25:34.184 --> 25:36.152
- I'll see you in there.
- Okay.

25:39.390 --> 25:41.124
You have that paperwork
for me?

25:41.191 --> 25:43.493
Well, I got something for you,
but it's not that.

25:43.560 --> 25:45.294
Didn't you learn your lesson
last night?

25:45.362 --> 25:46.529
I learned to listen.

25:46.597 --> 25:47.997
When you talked,

25:48.065 --> 25:50.900
you mentioned Hessington Oil,
so I looked back into it.

25:50.968 --> 25:53.269
Turns out you don't create
your own luck.

25:53.337 --> 25:54.470
Your associate does.

25:54.538 --> 25:55.938
What the hell
are you talking about?

25:55.973 --> 25:57.740
He conspired
with Harold Gunderson

25:57.808 --> 25:59.675
to file a lawsuit
against your own client

25:59.743 --> 26:02.178
so you could bribe witnesses
not to testify.

26:02.246 --> 26:03.679
- We didn't bribe anyone.
- [Scoffs]

26:03.747 --> 26:06.082
- That was a legal settlement.
- Don't try to tell me

26:06.150 --> 26:09.318
two rookie associates
who went to law school together

26:09.386 --> 26:11.354
and started at the same firm
made this happen

26:11.422 --> 26:12.955
without collusion.
I don't need to tell you

26:13.023 --> 26:14.757
anything 'cause
there's nothing to tell.

26:14.825 --> 26:16.826
Well, you're gonna
have to tell someone something,

26:16.894 --> 26:19.495
because that suit was filed
one day, settled the next,

26:19.563 --> 26:21.764
and those witnesses cancelled
their flights to New York.

26:21.832 --> 26:23.199
That is a bribe,

26:23.267 --> 26:25.201
and when I bring it
to the attention of the bar,

26:25.269 --> 26:28.805
you and your associate
are going to be in deep shit.

26:28.872 --> 26:30.907
Now who showed his tell?

26:30.974 --> 26:33.209
Here's your money back.

26:33.277 --> 26:37.113
And either I go to the bar,
or you settle for $2 million.

26:37.181 --> 26:39.115
You have until tomorrow.

26:45.775 --> 26:46.482
Where's Mike?

26:46.507 --> 26:47.246
He's in there.

26:47.247 --> 26:50.016
Harvey--

26:50.083 --> 26:52.385
- Harvey.
- Not now.

26:52.452 --> 26:54.620
You need to call Lola Jensen.
What?

26:54.688 --> 26:56.455
You need to get her
to hack into the bar

26:56.523 --> 26:57.556
and put your name in.

26:57.624 --> 26:58.758
What the hell
are you talking about?

26:58.825 --> 27:00.259
A week ago, you told me
that the number one rule

27:00.327 --> 27:01.794
was not to move
the goddamn body.

27:01.862 --> 27:03.863
A week ago, people weren't
sniffing around you.

27:03.930 --> 27:06.899
- Harvey, my job offer is not--
- This isn't about your offer.

27:06.967 --> 27:08.534
Quelling knows
about your bullshit lawsuit

27:08.602 --> 27:09.635
with Harold Gunderson.

27:09.703 --> 27:11.337
He turned me in?

27:11.405 --> 27:13.706
No, but he will
if we don't cave.

27:13.774 --> 27:15.941
- He can't prove anything.
- He doesn't have to.

27:16.009 --> 27:18.477
He hands you in to the bar,
they look you up, we're done.

27:18.545 --> 27:22.515
Not if I'm not here.

27:22.582 --> 27:25.518
Oh, that's why
you're in here.

27:25.585 --> 27:28.521
You're taking the job.
I am.

27:33.927 --> 27:35.494
And you think
an addicted gambler

27:35.562 --> 27:38.564
who lost his wife, his child,
and his house is gonna stop

27:38.632 --> 27:40.533
coming for you just because
you're not working here?

27:40.600 --> 27:42.702
You said it yourself.
Hacking into the bar

27:42.769 --> 27:44.236
is twice the crime
I've been committing.

27:44.304 --> 27:46.372
I am telling you
Quelling is on the trail.

27:46.440 --> 27:47.840
You don't do this,
we're gonna get caught.

27:47.908 --> 27:49.275
- There's got to be another way.
- There isn't.

27:49.343 --> 27:50.676
- I don't believe that.
- Then you better

27:50.744 --> 27:52.784
figure something out fast,
because tomorrow morning,

27:52.846 --> 27:55.614
we're done, and you quitting
isn't gonna change that.

28:04.324 --> 28:06.225
[Sighs]

28:06.293 --> 28:08.260
You can't fire
Katrina Bennett.

28:08.328 --> 28:10.229
I can fire
whoever I want to.

28:10.297 --> 28:12.798
She was covering for Louis.

28:12.866 --> 28:14.734
What are you talking about?

28:14.801 --> 28:17.470
Louis's engagement is over,
and he's losing it.

28:17.537 --> 28:19.205
He won't come in to work,
he won't pick up his phone,

28:19.272 --> 28:21.941
and he just didn't want
anyone to know.

28:22.008 --> 28:24.510
Then why are you
telling me?

28:24.578 --> 28:29.315
Because I helped her
cover for him.

28:29.383 --> 28:32.818
Are you saying
I should fire you too?

28:35.856 --> 28:39.191
I am saying that...

28:39.259 --> 28:41.861
We made a mistake,

28:41.928 --> 28:44.063
but that we were just
looking out for Louis,

28:44.131 --> 28:48.734
and I know how much
you value loyalty,

28:48.802 --> 28:50.269
so I don't think
that should be the thing

28:50.337 --> 28:55.174
that costs Katrina her job...

28:55.242 --> 28:57.051
or mine.

28:59.846 --> 29:01.647
- Jessica.
- I need you.

29:01.715 --> 29:03.783
No, listen, I just need
a little more time.

29:03.850 --> 29:06.619
And had you asked me for it,
I would have said yes,

29:06.686 --> 29:11.123
but instead, you had Katrina
cover for you.

29:11.191 --> 29:13.592
Oh, that little traitor.
What, did she rat me out?

29:13.660 --> 29:15.828
No, she didn't.
She's so loyal to you

29:15.896 --> 29:18.764
that she tried to pass off
her work for yours.

29:18.832 --> 29:21.967
Louis, Van Dyke wants
to look at our books.

29:22.035 --> 29:24.036
What?
We can't have that.

29:24.104 --> 29:26.972
I know.
This was her fix.

29:29.676 --> 29:31.210
Oh, no,
and you used this on him?

29:31.278 --> 29:35.247
I did,
and then I fired Katrina.

29:35.315 --> 29:37.383
- Jessica.
- I know.

29:37.451 --> 29:39.518
I can't fire her
for being loyal.

29:39.586 --> 29:42.788
But I can't afford you
sitting here licking your wounds

29:42.856 --> 29:44.723
while I get my ass
handed to me.

29:44.791 --> 29:46.158
Please, just listen to me,
okay?

29:46.226 --> 29:47.660
I cannot see straight.

29:47.727 --> 29:50.396
I cannot think straight,
and even if I wanted

29:50.464 --> 29:54.366
to come and help you, I wouldn't
be any good to you, so...

29:54.434 --> 29:58.404
Louis...

29:58.472 --> 30:02.208
I know you loved Sheila,

30:02.275 --> 30:06.078
but do you love your firm?

30:06.146 --> 30:07.079
You know I do.

30:07.147 --> 30:08.414
And when you love a woman,

30:08.482 --> 30:11.617
can you stand the thought of her
being with another man?

30:11.685 --> 30:14.286
- No.
- Well, Louis,

30:14.354 --> 30:20.125
Van Dyke is trying to get
into Pearson Specter's pants.

30:20.193 --> 30:23.128
What are you going to do
about it?

30:25.866 --> 30:27.800
I'm gonna put on
a goddamn chastity belt.

30:27.868 --> 30:29.101
How?

30:29.169 --> 30:31.337
'Cause Katrina actually
was on the right track.

30:31.404 --> 30:34.773
Van Dyke's claim is gone
if the partnership is gone.

30:34.841 --> 30:36.141
The bylaws say it's not.

30:36.209 --> 30:39.745
No, it is
if we become an L.L.C.

30:39.813 --> 30:42.748
We can't do that
by tomorrow.

30:42.816 --> 30:44.216
We'd have to rewrite
every contract.

30:44.217 --> 30:46.418
Boy, wow, Jessica, you
sometimes really surprise me.

30:46.486 --> 30:48.587
You don't think I know that?

30:48.655 --> 30:50.723
I have an army of associates
that I've trained

30:50.790 --> 30:52.391
within an inch of their lives.

30:52.459 --> 30:54.693
My name is
Louis goddamn Marlowe Litt,

30:54.761 --> 30:57.596
and my firm is under siege,
so don't you tell me

30:57.664 --> 31:00.666
what I can and cannot do!

31:10.437 --> 31:14.073
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:14.140 --> 31:17.743
I don't want to interrupt,
but I was just wondering

31:17.811 --> 31:18.944
what happened with Mike.

31:19.012 --> 31:20.913
He's leaving.

31:20.981 --> 31:22.915
[Sighs]

31:25.819 --> 31:28.153
I'm sorry.

31:28.221 --> 31:30.756
It's fine.

31:30.824 --> 31:34.460
Can I ask you something?

31:34.528 --> 31:37.329
Did you tell him
that you wanted him to stay?

31:37.397 --> 31:41.333
I didn't get around to it.

31:41.401 --> 31:42.968
You--you didn't
get around to it?

31:43.036 --> 31:46.539
I was gonna tell him, and then
he told me he was leaving,

31:46.606 --> 31:48.440
and then other shit
came up, so...

31:48.508 --> 31:50.209
So you just dropped it?

31:50.277 --> 31:51.477
I told you other shit came up.

31:51.545 --> 31:53.746
What other shit?

31:53.813 --> 31:55.848
I mean, you had
an emergency case filing,

31:55.916 --> 31:57.816
so you let your protege
walk out the door?

31:57.884 --> 32:00.152
- It's complicated.
- Okay.

32:00.220 --> 32:04.156
Well...then share it with me.

32:06.293 --> 32:10.195
Quelling came after us.
The Hessington witnesses.

32:10.263 --> 32:11.964
What?
That's bullshit.

32:12.032 --> 32:13.032
You may have blurred some lines,

32:13.099 --> 32:14.099
but you certainly didn't
cross any.

32:14.167 --> 32:15.267
Fight him.

32:15.335 --> 32:17.002
- No, I can't.
- Why?

32:17.070 --> 32:19.204
Look, I don't want
to talk about it.

32:19.272 --> 32:21.373
What is going on here?
When somebody pisses you off,

32:21.441 --> 32:23.042
you get in the ring.
What are you saying?

32:23.109 --> 32:25.444
What I'm saying is that
you're not taking on Quelling,

32:25.512 --> 32:27.012
but you're letting Mike
walk out the door

32:27.080 --> 32:28.280
without trying to stop him.

32:28.348 --> 32:29.615
I think one thing changed
the other,

32:29.683 --> 32:31.650
and I want to know why.

32:31.718 --> 32:34.386
Maybe what changed
is his desire to be here,

32:34.454 --> 32:37.556
and maybe what I have to say
doesn't matter.

32:37.624 --> 32:40.125
Of course it matters.
Now, what is this really about?

32:40.193 --> 32:42.127
Because it's sure as hell not
about some stupid case.

32:42.195 --> 32:43.662
You know what?
God damn it!

32:43.730 --> 32:47.833
For once, can't it just be
about what I said it's about?

32:47.901 --> 32:50.569
You didn't say
what it was about.

33:02.616 --> 33:05.551
Harvey, I'm really sorry

33:05.619 --> 33:08.087
that the Mike thing turned out
this way.

33:08.154 --> 33:10.889
I am, but I can't say
that I didn't see it coming.

33:10.957 --> 33:13.525
- Scottie, it isn't--
- What? It isn't what?

33:13.593 --> 33:14.793
It isn't what it seems?

33:14.861 --> 33:16.228
Because I don't know
what it seems.

33:16.296 --> 33:18.931
All I know is that any time
I ask you about anything,

33:18.999 --> 33:21.900
all you say is,
"I can't talk about it."

33:27.807 --> 33:30.242
I'm just gonna stop asking.

33:30.310 --> 33:31.510
Then we'll just
make up later,

33:31.578 --> 33:34.680
and we can do it
all over again tomorrow.

33:45.325 --> 33:48.460
[Knock at door]

33:55.468 --> 33:59.438
Quelling can't hurt us
anymore.

33:59.506 --> 34:02.574
- You went to see Lola.
- I looked at his accounts.

34:02.642 --> 34:04.510
I wanted to find out
where all that money came from

34:04.577 --> 34:05.778
to find all those clients.

34:05.845 --> 34:07.246
He doesn't have the money.

34:07.313 --> 34:08.414
And yet his rent gets paid,

34:08.481 --> 34:10.416
and they don't turn off
his electricity.

34:16.623 --> 34:18.290
Holy shit.

34:18.358 --> 34:19.992
Guess you didn't have to see
Lola after all.

34:20.060 --> 34:23.195
You think I got access to that
with a court order?

34:23.263 --> 34:24.496
So you did go see her?

34:24.563 --> 34:25.597
You put the idea in my head.

34:25.665 --> 34:29.935
I just came up
with a different agenda.

34:30.003 --> 34:31.937
We got him.

34:35.275 --> 34:38.010
No.

34:38.078 --> 34:40.746
You got him.
What?

34:40.813 --> 34:44.783
Your going-away present.

34:44.851 --> 34:48.620
Be a lawyer one last time.
Knock this guy out.

35:03.303 --> 35:05.237
[Knock at door]

35:09.209 --> 35:11.577
You have
my settlement check.

35:11.644 --> 35:14.346
I don't have a dime
for you.

35:14.414 --> 35:16.081
Then I guess the bar
is going to be hearing from me

35:16.149 --> 35:17.416
first thing in the morning.

35:17.484 --> 35:21.086
Well, then, they'll also
be hearing from me.

35:21.154 --> 35:24.823
Disciplinary rule 5-107a,
"accepting compensation--"

35:24.891 --> 35:26.125
- I know what it says.
- Then you also know

35:26.192 --> 35:28.560
the penalty
is being disbarred.

35:28.628 --> 35:30.348
You took money
from our client's competitors

35:30.396 --> 35:31.663
to trump up
your bullshit suit.

35:31.731 --> 35:33.332
You didn't come by that
legally.

35:33.399 --> 35:34.633
And they're not gonna care.

35:34.701 --> 35:36.135
I don't know
if you've noticed,

35:36.202 --> 35:37.870
but I don't have
a hell of a lot to lose,

35:37.937 --> 35:40.773
so sign my deal or get
the hell out of my office.

35:40.840 --> 35:43.575
Well, here's the thing,
James.

35:43.643 --> 35:47.913
I don't either...

35:47.981 --> 35:50.716
Because today is my last day
as a lawyer anyway.

35:50.784 --> 35:53.018
- Bullshit.
- Look at me.

35:56.623 --> 35:59.224
Good luck
in front of the bar.

36:03.062 --> 36:06.231
I wasn't always like this.

36:09.135 --> 36:11.870
I had tobacco in my sights.

36:11.938 --> 36:13.372
They offered me a lot
of money.

36:13.439 --> 36:15.507
I could have made a fortune.

36:15.575 --> 36:20.145
But $15,000 per client
for people with cancer?

36:20.213 --> 36:22.281
I risked going to verdict
because I wanted

36:22.348 --> 36:26.885
to get those people something
that could make a difference!

36:26.953 --> 36:30.989
And I lost everything...

36:31.057 --> 36:33.692
My clients, my wife, my kids!

36:33.760 --> 36:36.094
You lost them because
you gambled them away, James.

36:36.162 --> 36:38.096
I know that.

36:47.240 --> 36:50.976
Please.

36:51.044 --> 36:54.379
Being a lawyer is what I am.

36:54.447 --> 36:56.849
It's who I am.

36:56.916 --> 36:59.718
And if you take that away...

37:03.423 --> 37:06.124
It's up to you, James.

37:11.497 --> 37:14.132
I'll drop the suit.

37:19.472 --> 37:22.274
I promise.

37:28.982 --> 37:30.142
Louis,
where the hell are you?

37:30.149 --> 37:32.017
You said
you could get it done.

37:32.085 --> 37:35.487
I walk through those doors,
our books fly open.

37:35.555 --> 37:39.391
Get here now.

37:39.459 --> 37:43.996
Well,
this should be fun.

37:44.063 --> 37:46.265
We've never been across
the aisle from each other.

37:46.332 --> 37:48.533
Which is why you don't realize
that it won't be fun.

37:48.601 --> 37:49.935
We'll see what we see.

37:50.003 --> 37:53.538
Case 41432,
Van Dyke versus Pearson.

37:53.606 --> 37:55.974
Look at that.
Game time.

37:56.042 --> 37:59.711
Ladies first.
Ladies first.

37:59.779 --> 38:02.881
Son of a bitch.
For being polite?

38:02.949 --> 38:05.884
Were you being polite
when you hired me?

38:05.952 --> 38:07.819
What does one have to do
with the other?

38:07.887 --> 38:13.225
"To the man who hired me,
for all you've done."

38:13.293 --> 38:17.095
Do you want to know what I meant
when I wrote that card?

38:17.163 --> 38:19.531
The day you made me that offer,
I asked you,

38:19.599 --> 38:22.334
"did it have anything to do
with gender or race?"

38:22.402 --> 38:24.202
You swore it didn't.

38:24.270 --> 38:26.571
You lied to me.

38:26.639 --> 38:29.574
- It didn't.
- You're lying now.

38:29.642 --> 38:33.011
You know, Daniel Hardman
may have used people,

38:33.079 --> 38:34.880
but he didn't give a shit
about their gender

38:34.948 --> 38:36.281
or their color.

38:36.349 --> 38:38.884
- He showed you the list.
- Right next to my name,

38:38.952 --> 38:41.119
an asterisk.
Not "Law Review."

38:41.187 --> 38:44.556
Not second in my class.
Diversity.

38:44.624 --> 38:46.491
- You were treated the same.
- You tell yourself that,

38:46.559 --> 38:48.694
but we both know the truth,

38:48.761 --> 38:52.164
which is why I sleep at night
just fine.

38:52.231 --> 38:54.733
Well, it doesn't change
the facts in this case, does it?

38:54.801 --> 38:57.970
No. No, it doesn't,
but this will.

38:58.037 --> 38:59.705
Charles, you remember
Louis Litt?

38:59.772 --> 39:00.806
Sorry, I couldn't run.

39:00.873 --> 39:02.274
Doctor wanted me
to take it easy.

39:02.342 --> 39:03.475
Hey, Charles.

39:03.543 --> 39:05.477
[Spanks him]
Great to see you.

39:07.580 --> 39:11.049
You told me that story
to stall.

39:11.117 --> 39:13.318
- That was a stall...
- Hmm.

39:13.386 --> 39:16.054
But this is for me.

39:16.122 --> 39:19.324
When I saw that asterisk
next to my name,

39:19.392 --> 39:22.861
it made me sick to my stomach,
because in one second,

39:22.929 --> 39:25.797
I understood
how you will always see me.

39:25.865 --> 39:27.766
So that card was a thank you,

39:27.834 --> 39:29.768
because if I hadn't
have felt sick,

39:29.836 --> 39:32.471
then I might not have worked
as hard as I did

39:32.538 --> 39:35.107
to get where I am today.

39:35.174 --> 39:37.109
You woke the dragon,
Charles.

39:37.176 --> 39:40.112
How do you like me now?

39:50.356 --> 39:53.392
I know you're there.

39:53.459 --> 39:57.262
You need anything?

39:57.330 --> 39:59.264
No.

39:59.332 --> 40:01.466
The I.P.O. is wrapped up.

40:01.534 --> 40:02.768
We go public Monday morning.

40:02.835 --> 40:04.136
I wasn't talking
about the I.P.O.

40:04.203 --> 40:05.937
I was talking about
how you're feeling about Mike.

40:06.005 --> 40:08.907
I know.

40:11.310 --> 40:14.679
Okay.

40:14.747 --> 40:18.617
Good night, Harvey.

40:18.684 --> 40:23.288
I'm gonna tell Scottie.

40:23.356 --> 40:26.925
About Mike?
Are you crazy?

40:26.993 --> 40:29.027
You can't have it
both ways, Donna.

40:29.095 --> 40:31.430
You can't tell me to open up
and then keep my secrets.

40:31.497 --> 40:34.232
You spent more than a year
covering it up.

40:34.300 --> 40:36.535
You tried to get him to commit
another crime to cover it up,

40:36.602 --> 40:38.002
and now--
You said I should tell her

40:38.004 --> 40:39.504
what's really bothering me!

40:39.572 --> 40:40.739
I meant your feelings.

40:40.807 --> 40:41.973
I didn't mean
confess to a felony.

40:42.041 --> 40:43.642
These are
my goddamn feelings!

40:43.709 --> 40:46.144
Donna, I did something
when I hired him.

40:46.212 --> 40:47.679
It's caused all of this.

40:47.747 --> 40:50.949
I can't tell her,
and it's driving me crazy!

40:51.017 --> 40:55.353
Okay.
Look, Mike is gone, Harvey.

40:55.421 --> 40:57.923
I hate that he's gone,
but the jeopardy's gone too.

40:57.990 --> 40:59.858
It's done.

40:59.926 --> 41:04.663
And now you want to turn around
and tell someone who--

41:04.730 --> 41:07.666
Someone who what?

41:11.003 --> 41:12.137
Nothing.

41:12.205 --> 41:14.806
No, you better
finish that sentence.

41:14.874 --> 41:18.343
Someone who's pissed at you,
Harvey.

41:18.411 --> 41:21.179
Someone who keeps finding
a reason to be pissed at you,

41:21.247 --> 41:23.281
and it's not the third time,
and it's not the fifth time,

41:23.349 --> 41:24.916
and it's not the last time.
I thought you were trying

41:24.984 --> 41:27.185
to help my relationship,
not shit on it.

41:27.253 --> 41:28.787
Okay, you want to yell at me?
Fine.

41:28.855 --> 41:30.555
Because I know
you're not mad at me.

41:30.623 --> 41:32.891
And I know you're only
telling me this stupid idea

41:32.959 --> 41:35.093
because you want me to tell you
what you already know.

41:35.161 --> 41:38.563
You can't, Harvey.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.935
It's good that you want to,
but you can't.

41:47.507 --> 41:51.343
Could I have a minute?

42:01.120 --> 42:04.990
Congratulate me.

42:05.057 --> 42:08.560
I'm officially
a member of the New York bar.

42:08.628 --> 42:10.962
You went to Lola?

42:11.030 --> 42:15.371
I made a mistake.
I want to stay.
