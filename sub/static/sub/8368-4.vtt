It's a great-looking
character.

00:02.510 --> 00:04.745
So... that's really bad.

00:04.779 --> 00:06.480
That's a successful makeup.

- Scary.
- Good morning,

02:04.398 --> 02:05.732
- ladies and gentlemen.
- Morning.

02:05.766 --> 02:07.167
- Hello.

<i>McKenzie is standing in front

02:15.209 --> 02:17.243
It looks like we're
about to be interrogated.

02:17.278 --> 02:19.946
- Face Off.
- Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

02:19.981 --> 02:21.081
This is freaky.

02:21.115 --> 02:22.816
This is freaky.

02:22.850 --> 02:26.219
You were all selected because
of your unique skill set,

02:26.253 --> 02:29.155
and your mission
is highly classified.

02:29.190 --> 02:31.191
- Are you ready to be briefed?
all: - Yes.

02:31.225 --> 02:32.225
Good.

02:32.259 --> 02:33.860
In Sci-Fi's upcoming series,

02:33.894 --> 02:36.696
Hunters, a secret government
unit tracks down a group

02:36.731 --> 02:38.398
of ruthless terrorists

02:38.432 --> 02:40.967
whose origins
are shrouded in mystery.

02:41.002 --> 02:44.004
These terrorists display
supernatural abilities,

02:44.038 --> 02:46.506
proving difficult to combat.

02:46.540 --> 02:51.011
So for today's
individual Focus Challenge,

02:51.045 --> 02:53.546
you will attempt to turn
the tide on these terrorists

02:53.581 --> 02:56.483
by creating
foolproof realistic disguises

02:56.517 --> 02:58.218
for your model agents

02:58.252 --> 03:03.223
with the goal of rendering them
as unrecognizable as possible.

03:03.257 --> 03:05.592
It's a hard thing to do
to make a realistic disguise,

03:05.626 --> 03:07.060
<i>and it's an individual
challenge.</i>

03:07.094 --> 03:10.797
Aaah.
This is gonna be really tough.

03:10.831 --> 03:13.800
This stuff isn't
just in movies and TV shows.

03:13.834 --> 03:17.937
On a daily basis, our government
sends agents deep undercover.

03:17.972 --> 03:20.740
Lucky for you guys,
I was able to secure someone

03:20.775 --> 03:23.677
who has created real life
disguises for many people

03:23.711 --> 03:26.012
that he cannot disclose.

03:26.047 --> 03:27.414
- Nice.
- That's cool.

03:27.448 --> 03:29.816
Please give a warm welcome
to my dad, Michael Westmore.

03:29.850 --> 03:34.054
[laughter and applause]

03:34.088 --> 03:35.522
Hi, everybody.

03:38.125 --> 03:39.526
Thanks for being here.

03:39.560 --> 03:41.728
Now I know that you've done
a lot of work on people

03:41.762 --> 03:42.929
that you can't talk about,

03:42.963 --> 03:44.197
but are there any that you can?

03:44.231 --> 03:45.432
I had a nice time

03:45.466 --> 03:47.434
working with the Los
Angeles Police Department

03:47.468 --> 03:48.868
doing a lot of undercover work.

03:48.903 --> 03:50.003
- Wow.
- That's cool.

03:50.037 --> 03:52.072
There was one man
that came to the studio

03:52.106 --> 03:53.807
that said he was going
to go on a masquerade party.

03:53.841 --> 03:55.842
So I built a disguise for him.

03:55.876 --> 03:58.078
He went to Vegas
and held up a casino.

03:58.112 --> 04:00.747
So I've had all kinds
of fun things.

04:00.781 --> 04:02.215
- Holy cow.
- Then to top it all was I

04:02.249 --> 04:04.217
had the opportunity
to work with Michael Jackson.

04:04.251 --> 04:06.352
We built disguises for Michael
to be able to drive out

04:06.387 --> 04:08.555
his driveway and not have
all the fans follow him.

04:08.589 --> 04:09.889
What? Wow.

04:09.924 --> 04:11.357
All right, so what is the key

04:11.392 --> 04:13.460
to making
these realistic makeups?

04:13.494 --> 04:15.829
You have to consider the shape
of the face you're dealing with

04:15.863 --> 04:17.997
because you're going to
reconfigure the bone structure.

04:18.031 --> 04:19.999
And, there's lots
of little details

04:20.034 --> 04:22.135
that can be added too,
as far as freckles,

04:22.169 --> 04:23.403
and making dentures,

04:23.437 --> 04:24.804
and contact lenses.

04:24.839 --> 04:28.942
All these things are needed
to create a disguised character.

04:28.976 --> 04:31.211
Great advice, as always.

04:31.245 --> 04:33.213
All right, are you guys
ready to meet your models...

04:33.247 --> 04:35.448
- I mean, agents?
all: - Yes.

04:35.483 --> 04:36.983
All right, let's see
who we have in the field.

04:37.017 --> 04:40.019
[beeps]

04:40.054 --> 04:42.355
Instead of choosing your agents,

04:42.389 --> 04:45.892
they've already been
assigned to you.

04:45.926 --> 04:48.828
Reach underneath your seat
and pull out your folders.

04:48.863 --> 04:51.097
Oh, no.

04:51.132 --> 04:52.614
Oh, my goodness.

04:55.636 --> 04:57.137
Oh.

04:57.171 --> 04:59.706
- You can do it.
- All right,

04:59.740 --> 05:01.975
before you head off to start
working on your designs,

05:02.009 --> 05:04.477
I do have a surprise for you.

05:04.512 --> 05:05.979
- Oh, God.
- Oh.

05:06.013 --> 05:07.847
A producing legend

05:07.882 --> 05:11.117
will be joining
the judging panel this week.

05:11.152 --> 05:13.887
She's an executive producer
for The Walking Dead

05:13.921 --> 05:16.523
and of course the show
that inspired this challenge,

05:16.557 --> 05:17.824
Hunters.

05:17.858 --> 05:20.360
The one and only Gale Anne Hurd.

05:20.394 --> 05:21.928
Oh, nice.

05:21.962 --> 05:25.131
<i>I'm a major Walking Dead
fan, so to have Gale Anne Hurd</i>

05:25.166 --> 05:28.434
be the guest judge
on this is amazing.

05:28.469 --> 05:31.805
So as a reminder, because
this is a Focus Challenge,

05:31.839 --> 05:34.340
the focus is on the face.

05:34.375 --> 05:37.110
The judges expect precision.

05:37.144 --> 05:39.045
They expect beautiful edges.

05:39.079 --> 05:40.346
I'm so scared.

05:40.381 --> 05:41.915
- I'm scared too.
- We'll be by later on

05:41.949 --> 05:43.116
to check in
and see how you're doing.

05:43.150 --> 05:45.118
Until then, you're dismissed.

05:45.152 --> 05:47.387
- And good luck.
all: - Thank you.

My Agent McDonough

goes in her agency.

06:42.476 --> 06:43.710

<i>I'm moving her eyebrows

06:46.647 --> 06:48.214
<i>and lowering her cheekbones,</i>

06:48.249 --> 06:51.284
<i>and then just generally giving
her a more sagging appearance.</i>

06:51.318 --> 06:53.152
I'm feeling pretty good
about it,

06:53.187 --> 06:55.622
but I don't want to jinx it.

06:58.859 --> 07:03.963
I think if you do disguise,
if you overdo it, it looks fake.

07:03.998 --> 07:07.033
I have Agent Popzlateva,

07:07.067 --> 07:10.370
<i>and I will turn her
into a male maintenance worker.</i>

07:10.404 --> 07:12.839
<i>To turn her into a guy
is quite a challenge</i>

07:12.873 --> 07:16.509
because she has
a very tiny face, tiny chin.

07:16.543 --> 07:19.145
<i>I'll be making her chin
and her nose wider,</i>

07:19.179 --> 07:21.180
<i>and laying a beard by hand.</i>

07:21.215 --> 07:24.217
<i>I was in bottom looks
the last two challenges,</i>

07:24.251 --> 07:25.852
<i>so it's extremely refreshing</i>

07:25.886 --> 07:28.221
<i>to have an individual challenge.</i>

07:28.255 --> 07:33.359
No more getting approval
of my ideas.

07:34.628 --> 07:37.463
<i>My model is Agent Fuller.</i>

07:37.498 --> 07:40.366
<i>I'm gonna make him
into a heavy metal musician.</i>

07:40.401 --> 07:44.637
<i>I'm gonna accentuate his jaw,
his brow bone, and his cheeks,</i>

07:44.672 --> 07:45.838
<i>and his nose even.</i>

07:45.873 --> 07:49.208
So I'm designing
a full facial appliance.

07:49.243 --> 07:52.211
His band's called Face Off.

07:52.246 --> 07:53.813
Face Off!

07:53.847 --> 07:55.448
<i>I'm very excited
because the only thing</i>

07:55.482 --> 07:57.583
<i>I wanted going into this
challenge was a woman.</i>

07:57.618 --> 07:59.252
<i>Because women
have smaller features,</i>

07:59.286 --> 08:01.587
it is easier to add in disguise

08:01.622 --> 08:04.123
rather than trying
to subtract an existing feature.

08:04.158 --> 08:05.525
<i>I have Agent Stiles</i>

08:05.559 --> 08:09.429
and I'm going to be disguising
her as an elderly man.

08:09.463 --> 08:11.998
<i>My plan is to do a forehead,</i>

08:12.032 --> 08:14.067
<i>and neck, and cheek piece,</i>

08:14.101 --> 08:16.469
<i>and the nose
will be run separately.</i>

08:16.503 --> 08:17.570
<i>I was hoping this whole time
we'd get to do</i>

08:17.604 --> 08:19.072
<i>an old age makeup</i>

08:19.106 --> 08:21.741
so maybe I'm pushing that agenda
on this challenge,

08:21.775 --> 08:25.411
but I worry about my ability
to do it in the time allotted.

08:31.618 --> 08:34.419
I really want to push myself
and impress the judges.

08:34.455 --> 08:35.722
<i>So I'm thinking
turning Agent Wright</i>

08:35.756 --> 08:37.523
<i>into an eastern Indian woman</i>

08:37.558 --> 08:39.750
<i>will be a perfect way to do it.</i>

08:42.261 --> 08:43.596
<i>As I start sculpting,</i>

08:43.630 --> 08:46.666
<i>I use Nieli, Johnny's model,
as reference.</i>

08:46.700 --> 08:47.900
<i>She's very unique-looking,</i>

08:47.935 --> 08:50.036
<i>and my model has
very subtle features.</i>

08:50.070 --> 08:51.871
<i>So I'm gonna round
out my model's face,</i>

08:51.905 --> 08:53.439
<i>heighten her cheekbones,</i>

08:53.474 --> 08:56.242
<i>and I put a hook in the nose
hat changed the overall shape.</i>

08:56.276 --> 08:57.844
<i>Being able to take her forms</i>

08:57.878 --> 09:00.880
and transfer
them is going to be difficult.

09:00.914 --> 09:04.017
I've never done anything like
this before so this challenge

09:04.051 --> 09:06.733
is kind of putting me on edge.

09:08.322 --> 09:09.689
What are you guys doing?

09:09.723 --> 09:11.024
Making snaps.

09:14.395 --> 09:18.197
<i>For Agent Johnson I'm planning
to disguise him as someone</i>

09:18.232 --> 09:22.235
who you wouldn't even
suspect walking by.

09:22.269 --> 09:23.836
<i>A lighter-skinned,</i>

09:23.871 --> 09:28.074
<i>strawberry blonde,
green-eyed man in his mid-50s.</i>

09:28.108 --> 09:30.810
The complete opposite
of what he looks like.

09:30.844 --> 09:32.478
<i>Because this is
a Focus Challenge,</i>

09:32.513 --> 09:37.016
I'm using Chavant Clay which is
an oil-based plasteline clay

09:37.051 --> 09:40.219
that is really good
for fine details and textures.

09:40.254 --> 09:42.055
<i>So I downturn his nose,</i>

09:42.089 --> 09:43.356
<i>fill in his cheeks,</i>

09:43.390 --> 09:46.526
<i>I bring his top lip up,
shrink his lower lip,</i>

09:46.560 --> 09:49.896
and it's looking completely
different to what my model

09:49.930 --> 09:51.397
actually looks like.

09:54.768 --> 09:57.136
- What's your idea?
- He's gonna be like a hipster.

09:57.171 --> 10:00.606
A flannel-wearing,
beanie-wearing...

10:00.641 --> 10:03.209
- I got you.
- For my Agent Scamman,

10:03.243 --> 10:08.681
<i>I'm going to disguise him
as a late 20s, early 30s,</i>

10:08.715 --> 10:12.952
coffee-drinking, chubby hipster
just walking around town.

10:12.986 --> 10:16.456
<i>Because I don't want to have to
deal with recreating eyebrows</i>

10:16.490 --> 10:18.591
I decide to finish the sculpture

10:18.625 --> 10:21.694
at the bridge of the nose
and right underneath the eyes.

10:21.728 --> 10:23.329
<i>I'm giving him plump features.</i>

10:23.363 --> 10:26.265
<i>I'm also thinking a broken nose
with a little bit of a bump.</i>

10:26.300 --> 10:29.102
<i>So I'm nervous
about it being a subtle makeup,</i>

10:29.136 --> 10:32.138
but if I go too extreme
I could blow his cover.

10:32.172 --> 10:34.774
The pressure that you
have to have this done today...

10:34.808 --> 10:35.775
Yep.

10:35.809 --> 10:36.776
There is no other option.

10:36.810 --> 10:38.344
Nope.

10:42.049 --> 10:43.683
Hey, guys,
we're back to check in on you.

10:43.717 --> 10:45.651
- How are you?
- Hi.

10:45.686 --> 10:46.686
Hey.

10:46.720 --> 10:47.787
I have Cristof.

10:47.821 --> 10:49.522
I would like to do kind of like

10:49.556 --> 10:52.992
a Hell's Angel motorcycle
club member, lighter than him.

10:53.026 --> 10:54.994
Then I'm gonna
do a separate nose.

10:55.028 --> 10:56.996
But the one thing
that's really disturbing me,

10:57.030 --> 10:59.465
this jaw jutting out like that,

10:59.500 --> 11:02.268
I think it's gonna be cartoony.

11:02.302 --> 11:05.204
- Cartoony?
- Yeah, it just tapers too fast.

11:05.239 --> 11:07.540
This is the last thing
I want to hear.

11:07.574 --> 11:10.476
<i>I'm definitely worried because
this is a Focus Challenge.</i>

11:10.511 --> 11:12.445
<i>The face has to be perfect.</i>

11:12.479 --> 11:14.847
If I don't put a realistic
makeup in front of the judges,

11:14.882 --> 11:16.115
that's probably it for me,

11:16.150 --> 11:19.552
and it might send me home.

11:23.647 --> 11:26.282
This jaw, jutting out like that,

11:26.316 --> 11:28.451
I think it's gonna be cartoony.

11:28.485 --> 11:30.920
- Cartoony?
- Yeah, it just tapers too fast.

11:30.954 --> 11:32.722
If you want it to come out
that far, you need

11:32.756 --> 11:34.390
- to fill in the cheeks here.
- Okay.

11:34.424 --> 11:36.792
If I put a cartoony makeup
in front of the judges,

11:36.827 --> 11:38.094
<i>that's probably it for me,</i>

11:38.128 --> 11:39.762
<i>and it might send me home.</i>

11:39.796 --> 11:41.397
So what I would do,

11:41.431 --> 11:44.300
make a whole piece here
to broaden his face,

11:44.334 --> 11:46.002
then you'll believe
the wide jaw.

11:46.036 --> 11:47.770
<i>Because this is
a Focus Challenge,</i>

11:47.804 --> 11:50.773
we're only working on the face,
so it has to be perfect.

11:50.807 --> 11:52.542
- We need to protect our agent.
- Right.

11:52.576 --> 11:54.243
All right, pleasure.
Thank you very much.

11:54.278 --> 11:55.711
Thank you, Walter.

11:55.746 --> 11:57.113
I have Agent Phillips.

11:57.147 --> 11:58.447
I wanted to go for, like,

11:58.482 --> 12:00.950
<i>a middle-aged, darker skin,
maintenance man.</i>

12:00.984 --> 12:03.753
In your profile
you've got a ski nose going.

12:03.787 --> 12:05.621
You need to fill this out
a little bit.

12:05.656 --> 12:06.856
Like more flat?

12:06.890 --> 12:08.090
- Yes.
- Okay.

12:08.125 --> 12:09.659
Because there is a real
strong slope, you know?

12:09.693 --> 12:12.528
- Okay.
- I got Agent Johnson.

12:12.563 --> 12:14.764
<i>I'm doing mid-50s, old age.</i>

12:14.798 --> 12:17.366
He has hollow cheeks,
sharp features,

12:17.401 --> 12:20.136
so I went as opposite of him
as I possibly could.

12:20.170 --> 12:23.072
Make sure you can bring
that skin texture into here,

12:23.106 --> 12:24.907
because the age
you're giving him,

12:24.942 --> 12:26.242
you don't want
it to look like glass.

12:26.276 --> 12:27.510
Okay.

12:27.544 --> 12:29.712
I have Agent Nieli.

12:29.746 --> 12:31.681
She has very distinct features.

12:31.715 --> 12:34.417
Yes, she does. With what
her face naturally looks like,

12:34.451 --> 12:36.786
<i>I figured African descent
would be the way to go.</i>

12:36.820 --> 12:40.590
<i>So I want to push her eyes back
by bringing the face out some,</i>

12:40.624 --> 12:42.625
and bring the chin forward.

12:42.659 --> 12:44.894
There's a couple spots
I think you're pretty thin.

12:44.928 --> 12:46.195
- Okay.
- Right there,

12:46.230 --> 12:48.798
you might add
a little bit more cheek bone.

12:48.832 --> 12:50.199
- Okay.
- My mission

12:50.234 --> 12:53.669
<i>is to change Brielle
into a college-aged Asian male.</i>

12:53.704 --> 12:56.539
Whoa.
Okay.

12:56.573 --> 12:59.375
I don't know if you've done
enough on the inside corner

12:59.409 --> 13:01.544
- of the eye.
- Okay.

13:01.578 --> 13:03.546
Instead of being so high here,

13:03.580 --> 13:08.217
this could cut across here
a little bit more into there.

13:08.252 --> 13:10.353
Mr. Westmore pointed out
some very useful things.

13:10.387 --> 13:12.288
<i>I'm gonna take every bit
of his advice,</i>

13:12.322 --> 13:14.690
<i>and I immediately get to work.</i>

13:20.130 --> 13:21.564
All right.

13:21.598 --> 13:24.300
My Agent McDonough is going to
be disguised as an older woman,

13:24.334 --> 13:26.669
<i>like late 50s, early 60s.</i>

13:26.703 --> 13:28.871
<i>I sculpted the shape
of the face,</i>

13:28.905 --> 13:30.906
<i>now I'm gonna age
her a little bit.</i>

13:30.941 --> 13:33.509
<i>Texture is the thing that's
really gonna sell my piece.</i>

13:33.543 --> 13:37.213
I want it to be a subtle texture
so I take thick plastic,

13:37.247 --> 13:38.948
<i>and I just start tacking
through it.</i>

13:38.982 --> 13:40.916
<i>That creates a softer
skin texture</i>

13:40.951 --> 13:42.952
<i>and makes it look more organic.</i>

13:42.986 --> 13:45.121
I'm very happy
with my face sculpture.

13:45.155 --> 13:47.890
<i>She definitely looks
like a different person.</i>

13:50.827 --> 13:52.561
Anyone else scared
out of their mind

13:52.596 --> 13:54.664
- about an individual challenge?
- Mm-mm.

13:54.698 --> 13:56.932
I'm scared about this challenge.

13:56.967 --> 13:58.167
It has to look super real.

13:58.201 --> 14:01.003
Doing realistic makeup is hard,

14:01.038 --> 14:04.640
and it's our first time working
alone so it's super scary.

14:04.675 --> 14:06.542
Are you guys gonna use
foam or silicone?

14:06.576 --> 14:08.244
- Foam.
- If I knew how to do

14:08.278 --> 14:09.612
silicone well, I would.

14:09.646 --> 14:11.814
This isn't the time
to go exploring.

14:11.848 --> 14:13.883
- It's so much easier to paint.
- Silicone?

14:13.917 --> 14:15.484
To make it look like real skin.

14:15.519 --> 14:17.586
No, I know that,
but I know how to paint foam

14:17.621 --> 14:19.622
- to look like skin and I...
- I don't.

14:19.656 --> 14:22.525
I think this Focus Challenge
is a lot to ask

14:22.559 --> 14:26.329
because we have to create
this super realistic makeup

14:26.363 --> 14:27.730
<i>in 10 hours,</i>

14:27.764 --> 14:30.199
we have to apply it and paint
it to be super realistic,

14:30.233 --> 14:32.468
and we have to fool the judges

14:32.502 --> 14:35.071
to not knowing
who our model agent is.

14:35.105 --> 14:36.539
It's a tall order.

14:36.573 --> 14:39.208
- See you guys later.
- Bye, Anna.

14:45.982 --> 14:47.283
- I think he looks good.
- Yeah?

14:47.317 --> 14:49.318
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks.

14:49.353 --> 14:52.755
I have a lot of work
to do on my face sculpt.

14:52.789 --> 14:54.857
Michael Westmore said
it's too cartoony.

14:54.891 --> 14:57.226
<i>I'm glad Mr. Westmore
suggested that I change it</i>

14:57.260 --> 14:59.929
because I want this to look
as realistic as possible.

14:59.963 --> 15:02.031
You really broadened his jaw
a lot so it looks good.

15:02.065 --> 15:04.066
Hopefully he's less cartoony.

15:04.101 --> 15:06.068
I don't think he looks cartoony.

15:06.103 --> 15:07.903
That's good.

15:12.409 --> 15:14.143
<i>I take Mr. Westmore's advice</i>

15:14.177 --> 15:16.512
to bring the corner
of the eye in more

15:16.546 --> 15:18.781
<i>in order to hide
the model's eyes</i>

15:18.815 --> 15:21.350
<i>and to make her look more Asian,</i>

15:21.385 --> 15:23.452
and immediately it looks better.

15:23.487 --> 15:24.720
Immediately.

15:24.755 --> 15:26.789
<i>Now I'm probably
way over-confident.</i>

15:26.823 --> 15:28.257
Now I'm just like,
"Oh, what are you doing?

15:28.291 --> 15:31.060
No, I'm sorry. Gender swap,
race swap happening over here."

15:31.094 --> 15:33.496
So I'm very over-confident
right now.

15:38.668 --> 15:40.536
Have you done disguises
on yourself before?

15:40.570 --> 15:43.005
Yes, I've done disguises before.

15:43.039 --> 15:46.642
- Like what?
- Almost always male disguises.

15:46.676 --> 15:48.944
<i>I was the tallest person
in our costuming group</i>

15:48.979 --> 15:50.713
<i>so I was usually stuck
with the male characters</i>

15:50.747 --> 15:52.348
<i>since we were
an all-female group.</i>

15:52.382 --> 15:54.383
I was able to hang out with
my friends and they had no idea.

15:54.418 --> 15:57.887
I got really good at it
so I just kept going.

15:57.921 --> 16:01.290
I would totally
disguise myself as a boy.

16:01.324 --> 16:04.427
The biggest thing is
not so much how your face looks,

16:04.461 --> 16:07.763
it's your body language,
like adapting certain stances.

16:07.798 --> 16:10.232
So pretend to adjust
yourself a whole bunch?

16:10.267 --> 16:11.233
You have to adjust yourself.

16:11.268 --> 16:13.202
[laughter]

16:13.236 --> 16:15.204
Sit with your legs open,
you know, that kind of thing.

16:15.238 --> 16:17.740
Because we do that nonstop.

16:17.774 --> 16:18.974
If I'm not picking my nose,

16:19.009 --> 16:20.242
I'm adjusting myself.

16:20.277 --> 16:22.011
It's all I can do as a guy.

16:22.045 --> 16:23.813
[laughter]

16:27.484 --> 16:30.119
<i>I finish sculpting
pretty early since I just</i>

16:30.153 --> 16:32.121
<i>make a chin and a nose.</i>

16:32.155 --> 16:34.223
So I'm the first one
in the mold room

16:34.257 --> 16:36.094
<i>and it's a good feeling.</i>

16:38.495 --> 16:41.063
So I know I can afford
to take my time

16:41.097 --> 16:43.265
<i>to make a nice, clean mold.</i>

16:48.605 --> 16:50.840
I'm, like, totally
regretting this decision.

16:50.874 --> 16:52.508
Why? It looks great.

16:52.542 --> 16:54.109
I'm five hours in,

16:54.144 --> 16:56.078
and I feel like I might have

16:56.112 --> 16:59.715
screwed myself doing
an old age gender change.

16:59.749 --> 17:01.317
I feeling, like, very behind.

17:01.351 --> 17:04.118
It's taking me a long time just
to get the anatomy on the face

17:04.154 --> 17:06.055
to make her a him.

17:06.089 --> 17:09.592
<i>Now I need to age him, and
that's a whole nother process.</i>

17:09.626 --> 17:12.761
It's a lot of detail work
with an old age makeup,

17:12.796 --> 17:15.164
<i>and I'm doubting that I'll be
able to get it done.</i>

17:15.198 --> 17:17.800
I really bit off
more than I can chew.

17:25.056 --> 17:26.490
<i>I'm five hours in,</i>

17:26.523 --> 17:28.492
and I feel like I might have

17:28.526 --> 17:31.461
screwed myself doing
an old age gender change.

17:31.496 --> 17:32.963
Johnny,

17:32.997 --> 17:35.232
do you think for like the sake
of what we're doing here,

17:35.266 --> 17:36.233
I'm, like, wasting my time

17:36.267 --> 17:37.701
putting the nose
on the snap mold?

17:37.735 --> 17:39.336
I would just make
it all one thing.

17:39.370 --> 17:41.405
Yeah. I'm, like,

17:41.439 --> 17:43.407
starting to feel
that I should be doing that.

17:43.441 --> 17:45.709
I decide I'm just gonna
sculpt the nose on the face

17:45.743 --> 17:47.177
<i>because I'm losing time,</i>

17:47.211 --> 17:48.945
<i>and I don't want to have to
make a second mold.</i>

17:48.980 --> 17:50.981
<i>I have to get this done today.</i>

17:51.015 --> 17:54.384
I'm just hoping
it'll still look realistic.

17:56.754 --> 17:58.655
Oh, that looks awesome.
Oh, I love the mold.

17:58.690 --> 18:00.157
Thank you.

18:00.191 --> 18:02.226
<i>I notice I'm one
of the last to mold,</i>

18:02.260 --> 18:03.527
but I know I can get

18:03.561 --> 18:06.296
it molded quickly
so I'm really indulging myself.

18:06.331 --> 18:09.800
<i>I'm using texture stamps
to add roughness to the skin,</i>

18:09.834 --> 18:12.569
then I knock that down
just so it all homogenizes

18:12.604 --> 18:15.606
together to create
this realistic skin texture.

18:21.346 --> 18:22.412
Pop.

18:22.447 --> 18:23.947
<i>I pop out my mold,</i>

18:23.982 --> 18:26.617
and I probably have enough time
to clean up by hand,

18:26.651 --> 18:27.885
but I'm just lazy.

18:30.755 --> 18:32.189
<i>I just love the power washer.</i>

18:32.223 --> 18:34.892
Ssshhhh.

18:34.926 --> 18:36.193
It feels good.

18:36.227 --> 18:37.761
<i>It's like that scene
from Scarface.</i>

18:37.795 --> 18:38.929
"Hey, play...

18:38.963 --> 18:42.266
say, at my little friend."
Ssshhhh.

18:42.300 --> 18:43.467
It's bliss.

18:46.571 --> 18:48.605
30 minutes, guys.

18:54.579 --> 18:56.013
All right, guys. It's time.

18:56.047 --> 18:57.848
That's it.

19:06.124 --> 19:09.693
Here we go, guys.

19:09.727 --> 19:12.863
Beautiful, beautiful.

19:12.897 --> 19:15.799
<i>It's application day for
our disguise Focus Challenge,</i>

19:15.833 --> 19:17.701
and I check out
my silicone pieces,

19:17.735 --> 19:18.969
<i>and I have really good edges</i>

19:19.003 --> 19:22.105
to work with
which is very beneficial.

19:24.876 --> 19:26.109
Good morning, I'm Johnny.

19:26.144 --> 19:27.511
- Johnny, Nieli.
- Nice to meet you.

19:27.545 --> 19:29.379
Elena, hello.

19:29.414 --> 19:32.983
I'm going to turn you
into an eastern Indian woman.

19:33.017 --> 19:34.785
The first thing
I do is I punch eyebrows

19:34.819 --> 19:36.787
into the silicone face,
because obviously I don't want

19:36.821 --> 19:37.921
to do that
while it's on the model.

19:37.956 --> 19:39.056
That would be very painful.

19:39.090 --> 19:40.891
Since they're counting
on realism,

19:40.925 --> 19:43.060
I'm hoping
this will push me over the edge.

19:43.094 --> 19:44.528
I get out my hair
and I start punching in

19:44.562 --> 19:46.196
<i>the individual hairs</i>

19:46.230 --> 19:48.098
<i>to make
a more realistic eyebrow.</i>

19:48.132 --> 19:50.567
<i>I'm trying my best, but they're
a little bit crooked.</i>

19:50.601 --> 19:54.237
<i>The hair is super coarse,
so it's sticking up all weird.</i>

19:54.272 --> 19:57.207
I've just got to stay focused
and keep going.

20:00.144 --> 20:02.112
Bald cap's going on.

20:02.146 --> 20:03.714
<i>Because I'm creating
a receding hairline,</i>

20:03.748 --> 20:05.315
I don't have any prosthetics

20:05.350 --> 20:07.517
covering the edges
of the bald cap itself,

20:07.552 --> 20:10.954
<i>so applying a really
nicely blended bald cap</i>

20:10.989 --> 20:14.157
is one of the most
important parts of this makeup.

20:14.192 --> 20:16.126
<i>I'm looking at the clock and
getting worried about taking</i>

20:16.160 --> 20:19.129
<i>too much time, but luckily
I have a great silicone piece,</i>

20:19.163 --> 20:21.631
<i>so the rest of this
should go pretty quickly.</i>

20:26.437 --> 20:27.971
All right, you're gonna
look crazy for a few minutes.

20:28.006 --> 20:30.240
Realism is something
I feel like I excel at,

20:30.274 --> 20:32.342
<i>especially with painting
human skin tone.</i>

20:32.377 --> 20:33.910
I always start with
a blood layer.

20:33.945 --> 20:36.446
You as a human being
are very vascular.

20:36.481 --> 20:39.116
You have all your veins
and your blood

20:39.150 --> 20:41.184
and that all shows
through your skin.

20:41.219 --> 20:42.552
Like,
you have a white prosthetic

20:42.587 --> 20:43.820
on your face right now.

20:43.855 --> 20:45.155
So if I just start painting

20:45.189 --> 20:48.458
that skin color it's always
gonna look gray and dead

20:48.493 --> 20:51.061
because it doesn't have
that life color under it.

20:51.095 --> 20:53.964
<i>I use three different PAX base
colors to base it out.</i>

20:53.998 --> 20:58.902
Then I add blue veins and then
a crap ton of spatter paint.

21:03.174 --> 21:04.541
All right, I'm gonna start
with the mustache.

21:04.575 --> 21:06.043
I don't lay a lot of hair,

21:06.077 --> 21:07.277
<i>and it is not easy.</i>

21:07.311 --> 21:09.513
<i>So this scares me to death.</i>

21:09.547 --> 21:12.449
<i>I start on the outer corner
of the mouth using spirit gum,</i>

21:12.483 --> 21:13.917
<i>which is an adhesive,</i>

21:13.951 --> 21:17.721
and because I'm disguising her
as a young, Asian male,

21:17.755 --> 21:19.222
<i>I choose this black,</i>

21:19.257 --> 21:22.025
straight hair that looks a lot
like the wig that she's wearing.

21:22.060 --> 21:26.363
It's not what I consider to be
exemplary hair laying job,

21:26.397 --> 21:30.000
<i>but the clock's running down
so I go with what I have.</i>

21:30.034 --> 21:31.701
<i>But looking around the room,</i>

21:31.736 --> 21:33.804
<i>I'm just like,</i>

21:33.838 --> 21:35.172
"I'm good!"

21:35.206 --> 21:37.374
That looks great.

21:41.679 --> 21:45.215
<i>As I'm painting I'm noticing
it's looking really fake tan,</i>

21:45.249 --> 21:48.718
like I've been sprayed down
in a booth poorly.

21:48.753 --> 21:50.053
I'm trying to lighten it up

21:50.088 --> 21:52.389
with a little bit of air
brushing and highlighting,

21:52.423 --> 21:55.325
but the more I go, it's
muddying the waters even more.

21:55.359 --> 21:56.660
I'm gonna start spackling.

21:56.694 --> 21:58.862
<i>At this point
there's not much I can do.</i>

21:58.896 --> 22:00.697
I'm sort of stuck.
It's very heartbreaking.

22:00.731 --> 22:03.133
Shit.

22:07.071 --> 22:10.440
I have a certain tape trick
when it comes to laying hair.

22:10.475 --> 22:15.245
<i>I use tiny pieces of tape
with wool crepe sticking to it.</i>

22:15.279 --> 22:20.250
I lay it on backwards because
that's the way the hair grows.

22:20.284 --> 22:23.153
I have to make it look like she
actually could pass as a guy,

22:23.187 --> 22:26.356
and with my tape trick,
I think I succeeded.

22:26.390 --> 22:28.058
It's the new you.

22:35.233 --> 22:37.801
I've never done
a paint job like this before.

22:37.835 --> 22:40.470
She's supposed
to be an eastern Indian woman,

22:40.505 --> 22:42.973
<i>and she's looking orange.</i>

22:43.007 --> 22:45.008
Nobody's orange.

22:45.042 --> 22:47.811
<i>I don't know how to fix this,</i>

22:47.845 --> 22:52.082
so I'm kind of freaking
out at this point.

22:52.116 --> 22:54.284
15 minutes, everybody.

23:00.892 --> 23:03.860
Ugh.

23:03.895 --> 23:05.996
Time.

23:06.030 --> 23:08.665
I'm really nervous
about Last Looks,

23:08.699 --> 23:10.800
<i>because of my paint job,
because of my edges.</i>

23:10.835 --> 23:13.603
Those are two things
that have to be perfect,

23:13.638 --> 23:14.671
and they're not.

23:14.705 --> 23:15.839
Ugh.

23:15.873 --> 23:18.475
So there is a big chance
I could be going home.

23:30.953 --> 23:33.154
<i>It's Last Looks,
and we only have an hour left.</i>

23:33.189 --> 23:36.925
This is not easy, to hide edges
right around the mouth

23:36.959 --> 23:38.426
<i>I'm going to try,</i>

23:38.461 --> 23:42.097
but I don't know if I can do it.

23:42.131 --> 23:44.366
I'm gonna use a little bit of
PAX mixed in with the base color

23:44.400 --> 23:46.167
just to,
like, get these edges back in.

23:46.202 --> 23:50.004
<i>The edges aren't amazing, so
I'm stippling with Pros-Aide,</i>

23:50.039 --> 23:52.273
but I'm excited
about what I have,

23:52.308 --> 23:53.975
<i>and I feel okay.</i>

23:56.912 --> 23:59.848
<i>The face is real shiny,
so I'm trying to powder,</i>

23:59.882 --> 24:02.584
and I can't figure out where
the shininess is coming from,

24:02.618 --> 24:05.086
<i>but I'm guessing
it's the many paint layers.</i>

24:05.121 --> 24:06.888
Ten minutes left.

24:15.498 --> 24:18.199
That's time.

24:18.234 --> 24:20.702
- You okay?
- Nope.

24:20.736 --> 24:22.137
This is the worst makeup
I've ever done

24:22.171 --> 24:24.873
<i>so I'm preparing
myself for the worst.</i>

24:33.215 --> 24:36.518
Welcome to the Face Off
Reveal Stage.

24:36.552 --> 24:37.819
As promised,

24:37.853 --> 24:40.922
we have a very special
guest judge with us tonight.

24:40.956 --> 24:43.925
She's a producing legend
with an incredible resume

24:43.959 --> 24:45.260
including the show

24:45.294 --> 24:48.163
that inspired this week's
challenge, Hunters.

24:48.197 --> 24:51.499
Please give a warm welcome
to the lovely Gale Anne Hurd.

24:51.534 --> 24:54.936
[applause]

24:54.970 --> 24:56.171
<i>I love Gale Anne Hurd.</i>

24:56.205 --> 24:57.639
She's done a lot
of really cool stuff,

24:57.673 --> 25:00.909
<i>so I'm excited
for her to see my work.</i>

25:00.943 --> 25:02.277
It's so great to see you, Gale.

25:02.311 --> 25:03.445
Thanks for having me back.

25:03.479 --> 25:04.813
All right, are you ready
to see some makeups?

25:04.847 --> 25:06.080
Absolutely.

25:06.115 --> 25:08.316
Okay, let's get to it then.

25:27.236 --> 25:28.503
<i>My disguised agent</i>

25:28.537 --> 25:30.805
<i>looks better on stage
than I thought it would</i>

25:30.840 --> 25:32.907
and I'm pretty happy.

25:46.555 --> 25:50.225
<i>This makeup looks
so incredibly fake and dumb.</i>

25:50.259 --> 25:53.061
At this point I'm hoping
like hell that I'm safe.

26:08.010 --> 26:09.143
<i>Other than the eyebrows,</i>

26:09.178 --> 26:11.145
<i>my agent
looks the most authentic,</i>

26:11.180 --> 26:14.048
and I think
I could possibly win this one.

26:28.898 --> 26:30.899
<i>My agent is perfectly boring.</i>

26:30.933 --> 26:32.500
<i>Totally inconspicuous.</i>

26:32.535 --> 26:36.571
He's exactly the vision
that I had in mind.

26:48.884 --> 26:52.287
<i>My agent gives a nice
illusion of being a guy.</i>

26:52.321 --> 26:55.790
I think I have a good chance
of nailing this one.

27:10.105 --> 27:12.440
<i>Agent Fuller is rocking this,</i>

27:12.474 --> 27:14.542
<i>totally owning this character.</i>

27:14.577 --> 27:16.778
I am ecstatic right now.

27:30.159 --> 27:32.260
<i>My disguised agent
looks like an Asian person.</i>

27:32.294 --> 27:33.361
<i>Mission accomplished.</i>

27:33.395 --> 27:35.430
That's a victory in my eyes.

27:49.745 --> 27:51.245
<i>I'm proud of the work I did.</i>

27:51.280 --> 27:54.449
There's some mistakes, but I
think overall it's pretty cool.

28:08.297 --> 28:10.198
<i>I don't feel like
I've nailed this challenge.</i>

28:10.232 --> 28:11.899
<i>Like, I'm not expecting the W,</i>

28:11.934 --> 28:14.335
but I would be very surprised
if I went home.

28:30.285 --> 28:33.321
<i>She doesn't have correct skin
tones, my edges are horrible,</i>

28:33.355 --> 28:35.623
and I'm disappointed in myself.

28:51.306 --> 28:54.409
<i>I think my agent looks
just like a little old man.</i>

28:54.443 --> 28:56.911
She's so little
and as cute as a button.

29:02.384 --> 29:04.886
Okay, judges,
go ahead and take a closer look.

29:10.325 --> 29:13.761
The bizarre texture
all over the face is so heavy.

29:13.796 --> 29:15.163
It's so toy-like.

29:15.197 --> 29:18.966
There's no nasal fold.

29:19.001 --> 29:21.769
I don't even know what that
skin tone is supposed to be.

29:21.804 --> 29:23.471
It looks like you've been out
in the sun a long time.

29:23.505 --> 29:25.339
Yeah.

29:25.374 --> 29:26.607
<i>I don't want the judges
to see this.</i>

29:26.642 --> 29:28.142
<i>It's not my best work.</i>

29:28.177 --> 29:30.912
It was an attempt
to create a sweaty surface,

29:30.946 --> 29:33.381
but it just serves to make
it look more plastic.

29:33.415 --> 29:36.417
At this point I
know I'm probably in the bottom.

29:38.520 --> 29:39.887
All right, guys,
it's time to get on Twitter

29:39.922 --> 29:42.290
and tell us who made
your favorite disguised agent

29:42.324 --> 29:45.226
using #FaceOff

29:46.914 --> 29:48.514
It's just a single color.

29:48.548 --> 29:51.050
It only serves to make
it look more plastic.

29:51.084 --> 29:52.184
<i>I hate the skin tone.</i>

29:52.219 --> 29:54.186
<i>It stands out like a sore thumb,</i>

29:54.221 --> 29:55.922
and I don't want
to go out like this.

29:55.956 --> 30:00.192
She did the best eyebrow
and mustache placement though.

30:00.227 --> 30:01.761
I think that the stippling

30:01.795 --> 30:03.896
- here is pretty interesting.
- This is pretty good.

30:03.931 --> 30:06.866
All these edges
around here are pretty decent.

30:06.900 --> 30:10.102
Walking through a crowd,
this guy would go unnoticed.

30:10.137 --> 30:13.673
The forehead seems to work
with the hairline.

30:13.707 --> 30:17.009
Can you take the glasses off?

30:17.044 --> 30:19.111
Oddly, it looks
better without the glasses.

30:19.146 --> 30:20.813
- It does.
- Thank you.

30:24.384 --> 30:26.285
The edges are horrendous.

30:26.320 --> 30:29.455
To go for an Asian look
has created some issues

30:29.489 --> 30:33.526
with the design
from the very beginning.

30:33.560 --> 30:35.895
What is happening right here?

30:35.929 --> 30:38.564
It's so unfortunate because I do
like some of the other stuff.

30:38.598 --> 30:40.633
The neck is really good,
I think.

30:40.667 --> 30:43.069
It works.

30:43.103 --> 30:44.971
Can you open your mouth, please?

30:45.005 --> 30:46.939
Okay, thank you. Ugh.

30:46.974 --> 30:49.675
The paint work is so synthetic.

30:49.710 --> 30:51.043
Yeah, it's so dark.

30:51.078 --> 30:52.945
There's no natural colors.

30:58.452 --> 31:00.619
Okay, the judges
have scored your creations

31:00.654 --> 31:02.621
so let's find out
what they thought.

31:02.656 --> 31:05.024
Njoroge,

31:05.058 --> 31:07.626
Robert,

31:07.661 --> 31:09.829
Kaleb,

31:09.863 --> 31:12.665
Rob,

31:12.699 --> 31:15.401
Melissa,

31:15.435 --> 31:18.437
Katie,

31:18.472 --> 31:21.240
the judges would like
to hear from each of you

31:21.274 --> 31:22.775
before making their decisions.

31:22.809 --> 31:24.443
So congratulations
to the rest of you.

31:24.478 --> 31:27.179
You are all safe and can head
back to the makeup room.

31:34.121 --> 31:36.255
Njoroge, please step forward.

31:42.796 --> 31:45.064
Tell us about the concept
for this spy character.

31:45.098 --> 31:48.734
Agent Amsdell was disguised
as a young Asian male

31:48.769 --> 31:53.339
in order to infiltrate
a hacking ring over in Asia.

31:53.373 --> 31:54.340
How do you think you did?

31:54.374 --> 31:56.542
I like the work I did.

31:56.576 --> 31:57.843
That's a little bit alarming,

31:57.878 --> 32:01.881
because I can't
agree with you this week.

32:01.915 --> 32:04.116
You tried to create
way too many pieces

32:04.151 --> 32:05.518
that give you extra edges

32:05.552 --> 32:07.720
straight down the middle
of the cheek,

32:07.754 --> 32:11.023
which is impossible
to blend that there.

32:11.058 --> 32:12.992
The facial hair, it's so stiff,

32:13.026 --> 32:16.328
it feels like black straw
that's just been placed.

32:16.363 --> 32:20.066
And the illusion
falls apart very, very quickly.

32:20.100 --> 32:22.935
- Okay.
- Even from a distance,

32:22.969 --> 32:27.073
I see a girl
who has put some hair here.

32:27.107 --> 32:31.077
That is failing
at the challenge.

32:31.111 --> 32:32.878
Njoroge,
would you please head back.

32:32.913 --> 32:34.413
- Thanks.
- Okay.

32:38.285 --> 32:40.286
Robert, please step up.

32:45.625 --> 32:48.694
Tell us the inspiration
behind your secret agent.

32:48.728 --> 32:51.730
Well, this is Serge,
he emigrated from Bulgaria,

32:51.765 --> 32:54.300
and he is a electronics
maintenance man.

32:54.334 --> 32:55.634
Really well done, Robert.

32:55.669 --> 32:58.571
I like this makeup a lot.

32:58.605 --> 33:01.740
I actually like her better
without her glasses on.

33:01.775 --> 33:04.477
You did a real decent job
of laying all the hair.

33:04.511 --> 33:06.445
This is a real
successful character.

33:06.480 --> 33:07.713
Thank you.

33:07.747 --> 33:11.083
I thought either the nose
was hers or the forehead

33:11.118 --> 33:13.419
was also an additional piece,
because the two

33:13.453 --> 33:16.856
are so beautifully matched
in texture and color.

33:16.890 --> 33:17.890
Thank you.

33:17.924 --> 33:19.792
I buy you as a guy.

33:19.826 --> 33:21.293
Looking from here I think

33:21.328 --> 33:23.596
I'm looking
at a very thin gentleman.

33:23.630 --> 33:26.198
You wouldn't look twice.

33:26.233 --> 33:28.734
Robert, please step back.

33:32.339 --> 33:33.706
Good job.

33:33.740 --> 33:35.574
Kaleb.

33:41.448 --> 33:43.349
So tell us
about your spy character.

33:43.383 --> 33:46.719
Well, I wanted her to just
be a person from India

33:46.753 --> 33:48.287
walking around the Taj Mahal,

33:48.321 --> 33:49.989
nobody
you would expect to be a spy.

33:50.023 --> 33:53.125
I feel I'm looking
at a Caucasian person

33:53.160 --> 33:54.293
who's been painted brown,

33:54.327 --> 33:56.662
and that, of course,
is a huge problem.

33:56.696 --> 33:57.963
Yeah.

33:57.998 --> 34:01.000
You added cheekbones
that make her look malnourished.

34:01.034 --> 34:05.104
It's conveying
a confusing aesthetic.

34:05.138 --> 34:06.739
If you would have focused
on changing

34:06.773 --> 34:08.841
only the tip of her nose
and the bridge of her nose,

34:08.875 --> 34:10.643
that would have
been much more successful.

34:10.677 --> 34:12.378
Don't try to sculpt a full head

34:12.411 --> 34:15.080
when you can get away
with a facial appliance.

34:15.114 --> 34:17.349
The forehead
is so terribly dark,

34:17.384 --> 34:19.652
especially considering the rest
of the face.

34:19.686 --> 34:23.489
She would be very obvious,
a standout.

34:23.523 --> 34:25.056
Kaleb, would you please
head back.

34:25.091 --> 34:26.926
Thank you.

34:32.399 --> 34:36.335
Rob, you're up.

34:40.774 --> 34:42.574
Tell us
about your secret agent, please.

34:42.609 --> 34:44.710
Well, this is Agent Johnson.

34:44.744 --> 34:46.779
He was stationed
at a mountain campsite

34:46.813 --> 34:48.813
to observe suspicious activity.

34:48.848 --> 34:51.817
I have to be honest,
this character has zero interest

34:51.851 --> 34:54.219
for me, zero attraction,

34:54.254 --> 34:56.288
and that is
what makes it so fantastic.

34:56.322 --> 34:58.657
Thank you.

34:58.692 --> 35:00.626
In a crowd,
you'd have no interest in him.

35:00.660 --> 35:02.127
You'd just drive on
down the road.

35:02.162 --> 35:05.631
You've achieved invisible
in the most wonderful way.

35:05.665 --> 35:06.632
Thank you.

35:06.666 --> 35:07.700
From a distance,

35:07.734 --> 35:09.535
and even up close,

35:09.569 --> 35:13.639
you don't read makeup,
so your agent would survive

35:13.673 --> 35:15.874
and successfully achieve
his mission.

35:15.909 --> 35:16.942
Congratulations.

35:16.977 --> 35:18.177
Thank you.

35:18.211 --> 35:21.146
It's such a well
synthesized character.

35:21.181 --> 35:23.482
I feel like if I was camping
at this campsite,

35:23.516 --> 35:25.150
which you wouldn't
catch me dead doing,

35:25.185 --> 35:28.120
but if I was, I don't think
I'd notice this guy.

35:28.154 --> 35:30.322
- That was the point
- Thank you.

35:30.357 --> 35:32.224
Rob, you can step down.

35:32.259 --> 35:34.627
Thanks.

35:37.397 --> 35:39.298
Melissa, please step forward.

35:45.071 --> 35:46.572
Tell me about your concept.

35:46.606 --> 35:47.740
Agent McDonough

35:47.774 --> 35:50.776
has been swapped out
with the head of the FBI

35:50.810 --> 35:52.845
to find out where the corruption

35:52.879 --> 35:54.847
lies and search it out
from the top down.

35:54.881 --> 35:57.416
I went with the full face
appliance to alter pretty much

35:57.450 --> 35:58.851
everything I could.

35:58.885 --> 36:02.221
This to me is one of the most
confusing makeup applications

36:02.255 --> 36:03.856
I've ever seen on the show.

36:03.890 --> 36:05.257
Okay.

36:05.292 --> 36:09.628
From the eyes down, the sculpt
is very well handled,

36:09.663 --> 36:11.764
and the color
is expertly applied.

36:11.798 --> 36:15.034
And yet around the eyes
and above,

36:15.068 --> 36:17.836
there are massive
technical failures.

36:17.871 --> 36:20.272
Her eyebrows are way up
in the middle of her forehead.

36:20.307 --> 36:22.474
I don't know
why they're up so far.

36:22.509 --> 36:24.877
I was trying to move them up
to change the shape of her face.

36:24.911 --> 36:26.645
Well, it changed the shape
of her face, all right.

36:26.680 --> 36:28.714
Yeah.

36:28.748 --> 36:32.151
There's some nice
sculptural form in the chin,

36:32.185 --> 36:33.752
and the cheeks, and jowls.

36:33.787 --> 36:35.321
You've got skill.

36:35.355 --> 36:39.692
It's obvious from here down,
and it's not from here up.

36:39.726 --> 36:43.028
- Melissa, please head back.
- Thank you.

36:48.335 --> 36:50.002
Katie, please step forward.

36:57.110 --> 36:58.844
Tell me about Agent Phillips.

36:58.878 --> 37:00.112
Agent Phillips is

37:00.146 --> 37:02.514
a maintenance/construction
worker.

37:02.549 --> 37:05.150
My model had very sharp,
angular features,

37:05.185 --> 37:07.052
and I really wanted
to round those out.

37:07.087 --> 37:10.422
- For me it's a huge miss.
- Okay.

37:10.457 --> 37:12.424
I think it's a little too dark,

37:12.459 --> 37:15.227
and I realize that you were
trying to create some sort of

37:15.261 --> 37:16.462
perspiration look,

37:16.496 --> 37:20.532
but his entire face
got very, very shiny.

37:20.567 --> 37:21.633
It's a rough one, man.

37:21.668 --> 37:23.569
This no longer feels human.

37:23.603 --> 37:25.771
The hair, it's possible

37:25.805 --> 37:28.307
that somebody
could have that big a hair.

37:28.341 --> 37:29.508
I'm sitting right here.

37:29.542 --> 37:34.747
- I know.
- [laughs]

37:34.781 --> 37:37.216
The biggest thing
is that so little about this

37:37.250 --> 37:40.052
feels authentic and realistic.

37:40.086 --> 37:41.453
Okay.

37:41.488 --> 37:45.457
He seems like he's never
been inside in his life.

37:45.492 --> 37:48.527
The challenge was to have
someone who fits in,

37:48.561 --> 37:50.963
and both the hair

37:50.997 --> 37:55.167
and the skin tone really call
attention to this agent.

37:55.201 --> 37:56.535
Fair enough.

37:56.569 --> 37:58.504
Katie, please head back.

38:04.778 --> 38:06.812
All right, guys, will you please
head back to the makeup room

38:06.846 --> 38:07.846
while the judges deliberate.

38:07.881 --> 38:09.882
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

38:15.422 --> 38:17.856
Okay, judges,
your one-time special immunity

38:17.891 --> 38:21.160
is still available for you to
use tonight if you would like.

38:21.194 --> 38:23.429
So with that, why don't we talk
about tonight's looks?

38:23.463 --> 38:25.130
Let's start with Robert.

38:25.165 --> 38:27.599
<i>The simple nose appliance</i>

38:27.634 --> 38:32.070
<i>and its beautiful coloration
and texturing showcased a skill</i>

38:32.105 --> 38:33.772
that we've not yet seen
or Robert.

38:33.807 --> 38:35.007
Definitely the cleanest makeup

38:35.041 --> 38:37.276
and best laid hair
that we had up there.

38:37.310 --> 38:39.144
All right, let's move on to Rob.

38:39.179 --> 38:41.847
<i>This is an incredibly
successful disguise makeup.</i>

38:41.881 --> 38:43.348
<i>Everything is addressed.</i>

38:43.383 --> 38:45.050
<i>He had a lot of hair to hide.</i>

38:45.084 --> 38:48.287
I didn't even notice that it
was a bald cap application.

38:48.321 --> 38:50.222
It was well done.
I agree with you, Gale.

38:50.256 --> 38:52.591
All right,
let's talk about Njoroge.

38:52.625 --> 38:54.259
<i>This thing was a mess.</i>

38:54.294 --> 38:57.062
<i>Yeah,
but Njoroge doesn't see it.</i>

38:57.096 --> 38:58.564
That is horrifying to me.

38:58.598 --> 39:02.367
The makeup feels like it's
a racial stereotype instead

39:02.402 --> 39:04.736
<i>of a genuine, realistic person.</i>

39:04.771 --> 39:07.372
I immediately
said, "That is so not real."

39:07.407 --> 39:09.074
Okay, let's move on to Kaleb.

39:09.108 --> 39:11.343
<i>Speaking of racial stereotyping,</i>

39:11.377 --> 39:13.979
this is another one
that suffered a similar fate.

39:14.013 --> 39:16.281
It ended up looking
like a Caucasian person

39:16.316 --> 39:18.217
<i>with a solid coat
of house paint.</i>

39:18.251 --> 39:20.452
<i>The edges were peeling up
when she moved her face.</i>

39:20.487 --> 39:21.987
<i>That thing folded in half.</i>

39:22.021 --> 39:24.523
All right,
let's finish up with Katie.

39:24.557 --> 39:27.059
<i>Oh, my God, the tan guy
that works underground.</i>

39:27.093 --> 39:28.694
<i>I don't understand that at all.</i>

39:28.728 --> 39:30.395
<i>The sculpture didn't look human.</i>

39:30.430 --> 39:32.564
The paint job
clearly was not human.

39:32.599 --> 39:34.566
The edge work
was particularly rough.

39:34.601 --> 39:37.135
<i>It really fell down
on a technical level.</i>

39:37.170 --> 39:39.104
All right, judges,
have you made up your mind?

39:39.138 --> 39:40.372
- I think so.
- We have.

39:40.406 --> 39:42.441
Excellent,
let's bring them back out.

39:46.379 --> 39:48.480
Glenn, tell us
about the top looks.

39:48.515 --> 39:49.848
Robert,

39:49.883 --> 39:52.284
you chose a great path this week
by creating subtle pieces

39:52.318 --> 39:54.119
that changed the shape
of your model's face,

39:54.153 --> 39:56.555
and your application
was beautiful.

39:56.589 --> 39:59.358
Rob, you made a lot
of smart decisions

39:59.392 --> 40:00.459
in the design of your makeup,

40:00.493 --> 40:02.327
and your model's
everyman appearance

40:02.362 --> 40:04.663
made him truly unrecognizable.

40:04.697 --> 40:06.365
So who's the winner
of this challenge?

40:06.399 --> 40:08.667
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

40:17.760 --> 40:19.027
So who's the winner
of this challenge?

40:19.061 --> 40:23.832
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

40:23.866 --> 40:27.235
Rob.

40:27.270 --> 40:29.504
- Good job.
- Thanks.

40:29.539 --> 40:30.739
Your greatest success this week

40:30.773 --> 40:33.441
was your intelligent
approach to the challenge.

40:33.476 --> 40:36.511
So smart to alter your model's
most prominent features.

40:36.546 --> 40:37.913
- Great work.
- Thank you.

40:37.947 --> 40:39.414
Out of the challenges so far,

40:39.448 --> 40:41.616
this was the one that I really
wanted to win because

40:41.651 --> 40:44.920
I wanted to prove I could handle
a difficult makeup,

40:44.954 --> 40:46.054
and I did it.

40:46.088 --> 40:47.989
Rob, congratulations.

40:48.024 --> 40:50.959
You, Robert and Melissa
can all head

40:50.993 --> 40:53.595
- back to the makeup room.
- Thank you.

40:59.135 --> 41:00.468
All right, guys,

41:00.503 --> 41:02.571
that means the rest of you
are on the bottom this week.

41:02.605 --> 41:05.574
One of you will be going home.

41:05.608 --> 41:07.409
Please step forward.

41:15.151 --> 41:17.319
All right, Glenn,
tell us about the bottom looks.

41:17.353 --> 41:21.072
Njoroge, while we appreciate
your incredible ambition,

41:21.093 --> 41:23.527
you set yourself up for failure
from the start

41:23.562 --> 41:25.996
by setting the bar way too high.

41:26.031 --> 41:27.431
Kaleb,

41:27.466 --> 41:30.801
you also tried to do something
that was just too difficult.

41:30.836 --> 41:32.102
Your flat paint job

41:32.138 --> 41:34.037
ended up highlighting
the flawed anatomical shapes

41:34.073 --> 41:35.556
in your sculpture.

41:35.591 --> 41:38.475
Katie, the lack of breakup
in your paintjob

41:38.511 --> 41:40.110
gave him a very synthetic look

41:40.146 --> 41:42.412
and the dark skin tone
seemed like a mismatch

41:42.448 --> 41:43.847
for your character.

41:43.899 --> 41:46.133
So who is going home tonight?

41:46.185 --> 41:49.286
The person
going home tonight is...

41:53.993 --> 41:56.844
Njoroge.

41:56.896 --> 41:58.228
Unfortunately your makeup

41:58.264 --> 42:02.866
was tremendously flawed
both creatively and technically.

42:02.902 --> 42:05.903
Njoroge, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

42:05.955 --> 42:09.139
That means, Katie and Kaleb,
you're both safe this week

42:09.191 --> 42:11.041
and can head back
to the makeup room.

42:11.076 --> 42:12.159
Thanks.

42:16.048 --> 42:17.815
Njoroge, it's obvious to us

42:17.850 --> 42:19.983
that you have a passion
for makeup artistry.

42:20.019 --> 42:23.487
We wish you all the best of luck
and continued success, dear.

42:23.489 --> 42:24.822
Thank you.

42:24.874 --> 42:27.508
Njoroge, it's been so great
having you here with us.

42:27.543 --> 42:29.226
Would you please head
back to the makeup room

42:29.261 --> 42:30.511
and pack up your kit.

42:30.563 --> 42:31.628
Thank you so much for having me.

42:31.664 --> 42:32.663
- Thank you.
- Good luck, Njoroge.

42:32.698 --> 42:33.647
- Thank you, Njoroge.
- Good luck.

42:33.682 --> 42:34.681
- Good luck.
- Take care.

42:34.733 --> 42:35.949
<i>I'm a little disappointed.</i>

42:36.001 --> 42:37.886
I wanted to go further,
of course.

42:40.272 --> 42:41.772
It's me.

42:41.774 --> 42:44.308
<i>But this experience has shown
me that even at the age of 49,</i>

42:44.310 --> 42:46.176
you can still chase a dream.

42:46.178 --> 42:48.912
There we go.

42:48.948 --> 42:51.181
<i>So it doesn't end here.</i>

42:51.217 --> 42:52.683
<i>I'm gonna pursue this
and keep going,</i>

42:52.735 --> 42:55.085
and keep doing makeup,
and hopefully I can do

42:55.120 --> 42:58.071
this professionally,
and just see what's next.
