00:04.537 --> 00:06.439
I think I need it to be
at 6.35.

00:06.473 --> 00:08.008
I think we can
meet there, Ryan.

00:08.041 --> 00:11.544
I'm sharing this listing with
Olivia, because I'm a giver.

00:11.578 --> 00:13.546
If get a buyer for
penthouse one,

00:13.580 --> 00:18.518
you wear a bunny suit, and be my
assistant for an entire day.

00:18.551 --> 00:19.953
- Wow.
- How do you like it?

00:19.986 --> 00:21.688
There's nothing to cheer me up

00:21.721 --> 00:24.391
like a beautifully finished
townhouse.

00:24.424 --> 00:25.892
- We did it.
- We did it.

00:25.925 --> 00:27.894
Now you have to do it.
Sell.

00:27.927 --> 00:30.063
Definitely a golden shower.

00:30.096 --> 00:32.699
Richard Hamilton is a very, very
well known broker in the city.

00:32.732 --> 00:35.368
Am I going to be dealing with
you, or one of your assistants?

00:35.402 --> 00:37.003
I have no girlfriend,
I have no friends,

00:37.037 --> 00:38.972
I dedicate my entire life
to my job.

00:39.005 --> 00:41.341
Wow, that's so sad.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.680
My motto is expansion,

00:46.713 --> 00:49.616
always, in all ways.

00:49.649 --> 00:52.886
New York City is the most
exciting city for real estate.

00:52.919 --> 00:54.020
And that's why I'm here.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.456
I'm the closer,
and the listing machine.

00:56.489 --> 00:59.059
What makes me better is that I
work harder than anyone else.

00:59.092 --> 01:00.226
Whee!

01:00.260 --> 01:01.961
We're friends now, right?

01:02.062 --> 01:04.364
I don't need him,
and you don't either.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.232

[alarm clock beeping]

01:31.658 --> 01:32.826
Good morning!

01:32.859 --> 01:34.260
Mommy!

01:36.096 --> 01:38.298
- I'm not eating, momma.
- Luis, please.

01:38.331 --> 01:39.432
I gotta go soon.

01:39.466 --> 01:40.700
(Luis)
I actually thought for once

01:40.734 --> 01:44.004
that this was a good time
for my mother to visit.

01:44.104 --> 01:47.107
I truly thought that I was
wrapping up

01:47.107 --> 01:49.576
the easiest deal of my career.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.479
(Luis)
It's such a unique apartment

01:52.512 --> 01:54.647
with 4 bedrooms, 2 1/2
bathrooms, private terrace,

01:54.681 --> 01:57.350
triplex, in a penthouse floor,

01:57.384 --> 01:58.885
for less than $3 million
on the upper east side.

01:58.918 --> 02:00.053
I think it's well priced.

02:00.086 --> 02:01.454
Rich, talk to me.

02:02.822 --> 02:03.923
Ha! We got a deal, Papa.

02:06.626 --> 02:09.062
But after the
contracts went out,

02:09.095 --> 02:10.964
the broker disappeared.

02:11.064 --> 02:12.098
Literally.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.534
Can you tell me
where is Rich Hamilton?

02:14.567 --> 02:15.802
It's been seven days.

02:15.835 --> 02:19.572
He is not responding
to messages, calls, emails.

02:19.606 --> 02:21.474
He is MIA.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.415
Mama, I'm smelling pancakes.

02:28.448 --> 02:29.616
What?

02:29.649 --> 02:32.619
So now...[exhales]
I'm back to square one.

02:34.087 --> 02:37.323
Good morning,
good morning.

02:37.357 --> 02:38.658
Please, sit down.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.093
I feel so bad.

02:40.093 --> 02:41.895
I don't have time for pancakes.

02:41.928 --> 02:43.797
Oh, God.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.932
Okay, maybe one pancake.

02:45.965 --> 02:47.901
- Luis.
- Yes.

02:47.934 --> 02:51.504
You have no family pictures
in your apartment.

02:55.542 --> 02:59.379
Well, I don't spend much time
in my apartment.

02:59.412 --> 03:01.214
- You know, I'm always working.
- I don't like that.

Mm-mm.
Stop worrying, please.

Mmm.

Can everybody gather around?

03:47.560 --> 03:48.728
Come here, come.

03:48.762 --> 03:51.431
I want to talk about this
townhouse listing.

03:51.464 --> 03:53.099
It's been almost a month now

03:53.133 --> 03:54.401
since the finishes were
installed

03:54.434 --> 03:56.369
in my townhouse in
the west village.

03:58.004 --> 04:00.707
The results were perfection.

04:03.243 --> 04:06.880
22.5 we knew was expensive.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.049
But we have to find a buyer.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.917
We signed the 45-day extension

04:10.950 --> 04:12.952
as soon as the finishes
were completed.

04:13.053 --> 04:15.288
And I expected
non-stop showings.

04:15.321 --> 04:17.624
But...that hasn't
been the case.

04:17.657 --> 04:20.226
People just don't pay this kind
of price per square foot.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.162
for townhomes
in the city.

04:22.195 --> 04:23.797
They will because
it's gorgeous,

04:23.830 --> 04:25.298
and we advise on the finishes,

04:25.331 --> 04:26.566
and we're gonna set
a new record.

04:26.599 --> 04:29.502
Guys,
22 1/2 that's outrageous.

04:29.536 --> 04:31.338
You're gonna have to spend
a lot of money.

04:33.873 --> 04:35.342
Based on the beautiful finishes,

04:35.375 --> 04:39.279
I reluctantly agreed to this
crazy high price.

04:39.312 --> 04:42.482
A record price.
But that was months ago.

04:42.515 --> 04:44.684
And you can smell it,
that the market

04:44.718 --> 04:46.953
is taking a little bit
of a breather, right?

04:46.986 --> 04:50.657
Buyers are taking their time,
there's not as much urgency.

04:50.690 --> 04:53.326
Right now, the market
is unpredictable.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.394
It's uneven.

04:54.427 --> 04:56.162
Some things sell really quickly,

04:56.196 --> 05:00.033
then others, like this
townhouse, sell slowly.

05:00.066 --> 05:01.735
It's gonna take longer,
because--

05:01.768 --> 05:03.436
I don't have the time, John,
I don't have the time.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.505
- We don't have the time.
- I get it, I understand.

05:05.538 --> 05:07.340
The clock is ticking, the
listing agreement is expiring.

05:07.374 --> 05:08.708
I'm sweating.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.443
See, this is what
he's doing to me all the time.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.179
Is it sold?

05:13.213 --> 05:15.849
Oh. Here comes another message.

05:15.882 --> 05:17.050
Just promise me one thing.

05:17.050 --> 05:20.053
No more text messages.
I will sell it.

05:20.053 --> 05:22.055
I am not losing this listing.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.957
Too much time, too much effort.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.759
The listing agreement
expires with these guys

05:25.792 --> 05:27.227
in just a few weeks,

05:27.260 --> 05:29.496
and I don't sell it before then,
it's gonna be a problem.

05:29.529 --> 05:32.465
We're never better
than our last transaction.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.334
We need to sell this.

Yuri, we're meeting Olivia
at 22 Renwick this afternoon.

05:46.579 --> 05:49.082
But first, we have to
go over to 57th Street.

05:49.082 --> 05:51.217
[whispering]
Okay, let's go, go go go go.

05:51.251 --> 05:56.089
West 57th Street sits alongside
the sound end of Central Park,

05:56.089 --> 05:57.957
and it's being referred to
more recently

05:57.991 --> 06:00.026
as Billionaires Row.

06:00.026 --> 06:04.564
All along this stretch are
a series of brand new buildings.

06:04.597 --> 06:07.300
And they all have three things
in common:

06:07.334 --> 06:09.903
they're ultra-tall,
ultra-luxury,

06:09.936 --> 06:12.439
and they cater
to the ultra-rich.

06:12.472 --> 06:14.741
[cell phone rings]

06:14.774 --> 06:15.775
Hey, what's up?

06:18.745 --> 06:20.246
All right, thanks.

06:20.280 --> 06:24.050
Victor is representing
a high-tech tycoon,

06:24.050 --> 06:25.885
and he reached out to me
about selling an apartment

06:25.919 --> 06:29.389
at  One 57 West 57th Street.

06:29.422 --> 06:30.590
All right, I'll be right back.

06:30.623 --> 06:33.193
Last year,
the top penthouse here,

06:33.226 --> 06:35.762
sold for $100 million.

06:35.795 --> 06:38.164
At the time, it was
the most expensive

06:38.198 --> 06:42.268
real estate transaction in
the history of New York City.

06:44.471 --> 06:45.739
Hello?

06:45.772 --> 06:48.074
Wow.

06:53.513 --> 06:56.349
(Victor)
I see you found us.

06:59.519 --> 07:02.022
Hi, welcome, welcome.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.323
Victor?

07:03.356 --> 07:05.158
I'm here.

07:05.191 --> 07:07.060
You just scared
the sh** out of me.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.628
You aren't even
in the city.

07:08.661 --> 07:10.363
I'm actually very far away.

07:10.397 --> 07:11.798
Ah.

07:11.831 --> 07:15.101
What are these nerds in Silicon
Valley gonna think of next?

07:17.070 --> 07:19.039
So just because this is
very, very weird,

07:19.072 --> 07:21.041
what is this thing?

07:21.041 --> 07:22.442
It's remote controlled.

07:22.475 --> 07:24.577
Uh, it's just like you're
talking to someone on Skype

07:24.611 --> 07:27.414
but with wheels and who can walk
around and show you stuff.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.683
It's--there's nothing to fear.
[laughs]

07:29.716 --> 07:31.751
Uh, okay. So...

07:31.785 --> 07:34.054
why don't you give me
the rest of the tour?

07:34.054 --> 07:37.223
Okay. Let's go.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.670
Wow. This is very, very
beautiful.

07:53.540 --> 07:56.309
This is definitely a closet
with a view.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.581
You there, Ryan?

08:01.614 --> 08:03.817
Yep! Right, right behind you.

08:10.123 --> 08:12.292
This is pretty incredible.

08:15.095 --> 08:18.031
Ryan, let's talk business,
shall we?

08:18.064 --> 08:20.333
Sure.

08:20.367 --> 08:24.838
My boss bought this apartment
in 2011 at $8.9 mil.

08:24.871 --> 08:27.474
Did a lot of reconstruction,

08:27.507 --> 08:30.343
and he'd like to get some
return on his investment.

08:30.377 --> 08:31.778
Your boss can make
a lot of money.

08:31.811 --> 08:34.247
If they price it at
$12 million,

08:34.280 --> 08:37.884
that's a $3 million return
in less than two years.

08:37.917 --> 08:41.254
He was thinkin' a little higher.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.358
I think we could go up,
I mean, 16.

08:46.426 --> 08:47.827
Would you--I'm sorry,
you were,

08:47.861 --> 08:49.662
I think, it looked like you were
buffering there for a second.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.765
Did you say $16 million
for this?

08:51.798 --> 08:53.400
1-6, yes.

08:53.433 --> 08:54.467
Ah.

08:54.501 --> 08:57.737
$16 million is
way too high.

08:57.771 --> 09:00.006
Hmm.

09:00.006 --> 09:02.008
The average price per
square foot in the building

09:02.042 --> 09:05.578
is about $6,800.

09:05.612 --> 09:09.149
And that includes apartments
that are higher than yours,

09:09.182 --> 09:11.885
that face directly
over the Essex House,

09:11.918 --> 09:14.187
and have clear, open,
beautiful views.

09:16.322 --> 09:20.026
This is a 2-bed,
2 1/2 bath apartment,

09:20.026 --> 09:22.696
with an 8-figure
price tag.

09:22.729 --> 09:26.866
Buyers at that price point are
not gonna want obstructed views.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.903
They're not gonna want
obstructed anything.

09:29.936 --> 09:33.039
Maybe we could come down
a little, uh, 15.

09:33.039 --> 09:35.141
15 million is still very high.

09:35.175 --> 09:39.512
[pedestal whirring]

09:39.546 --> 09:41.047
Uh-huh.

09:41.047 --> 09:44.050
My boss isn't gonna be happy
if we don't get to 14 mil.

09:44.050 --> 09:47.120
Okay.
We would then need to price it

09:47.153 --> 09:50.690
just below 14, say 13.95,

09:50.724 --> 09:54.294
then I'm getting everyone
that's looking up to 14.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.433
All right, Ryan.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.104
Okay.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.506
But I actually have to run now.
'Bye now.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.744
Hello.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.181
Oh, my God.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.017
What just happened?

10:19.386 --> 10:21.688
The only thing that I need now
is time.

10:21.721 --> 10:23.289
You have one week.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.657
I want to be so great,

10:24.691 --> 10:26.159
and I have the ability.

10:26.192 --> 10:28.661
You don't know what balance is.

10:33.533 --> 10:37.237
[percussion music]

10:37.270 --> 10:38.304
Okay, Roni, what else?

10:39.739 --> 10:41.107
You need to
approve the marketing material,

10:41.141 --> 10:42.609
I need you to
look at the description I wrote.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.010
- Yep.
- It has to go live today.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.814
Losing the offer
on 90th street

10:47.847 --> 10:49.983
is the last thing
I need right now.

10:50.016 --> 10:53.386
For the broker to just...
disappear?

10:53.420 --> 10:54.387
You have a call right now.

10:54.421 --> 10:55.889
Yes.
Put him through.

10:55.922 --> 10:57.223
From the moment that I wake up,

10:57.257 --> 10:59.259
all the way to the moment
that I try to sleep,

10:59.292 --> 11:00.927
I am bombarded.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.128
Tell me what time
tomorrow works.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.263
Tomorrow doesn't work.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.331
But even delegating
the simplest thing,

11:05.365 --> 11:07.100
I have a hard time doing.

11:07.133 --> 11:08.501
Hello, this is Luis.

11:08.535 --> 11:10.370
Yes, I am so sorry to
keep you waiting.

11:10.403 --> 11:13.173
In my head, nobody can do
the things that I do

11:13.206 --> 11:14.240
the way I do them.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.408
Okay, Roni, what else?

11:15.442 --> 11:16.876
I have to go, right?
I have a showing now?

11:16.910 --> 11:19.479
Yeah, but I need you to, like,
take five. Just relax.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.081
I don't need you to
tell me to relax.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.682
I need to--we need to go over
these things.

11:22.716 --> 11:25.418
I need interviews on all of
these graphic designers.

11:25.452 --> 11:26.853
[exhales]
Can you hold on for a second?

11:26.886 --> 11:28.822
Roni, can you get me
some water, please?

11:28.855 --> 11:32.759
All of this stuff is starting to
affect me, physically.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.227
I've been trying to
talk to these--

11:34.260 --> 11:37.664
- I understand. I understand.
- I need to take this meeting.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.733
[exhales]
It's f***ing crazy.

11:39.766 --> 11:41.835
Do me a favor, can you send
flowers to my mother?

11:41.868 --> 11:43.269
She's in my apartment.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.871
Eat lunch!

11:50.210 --> 11:51.211
(Olivia)
Watch your step.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.213
The sheer outdoor space

11:53.246 --> 11:55.548
is really what's so great
about this apartment.

11:55.582 --> 11:57.150
I mean, it's a good price,
it's a good deal.

11:57.183 --> 11:59.619
Lots of interior square footage,
but you have

11:59.652 --> 12:01.721
four terraces that are
about this size,

12:01.755 --> 12:03.656
so tons of space for lounging
and hanging out.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.959
Even dining upstairs
on the roof deck.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.360
And then you have just

12:07.394 --> 12:08.762
breathtaking views
of the downtown.

12:08.795 --> 12:10.296
The lighting is great.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.598
- Yeah.
- Let's take a look at the rest.

12:11.631 --> 12:15.068
Cool. Right here to the left
is the powder room.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.470
It's really nice to have sort of
like the privacy downstairs

12:17.504 --> 12:18.705
and the entertaining here.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.174
So this is the main living,
dining space.

12:21.207 --> 12:23.843
[whistling]

12:23.877 --> 12:26.446
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

12:28.181 --> 12:29.315
- Ryan, Alexander.
- Ryan, good to see you.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.550
- Good to see you, Ryan.
- Hey.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.818
Well, I gotta run,
I have another appointment.

12:31.851 --> 12:33.186
It's good to see you both.

12:33.219 --> 12:35.388
I really appreciate you
showing me the place, and uh--

12:35.422 --> 12:36.856
- Great. Hey, thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.892
It's been a few days since
Olivia's open house

12:38.925 --> 12:40.093
at the 22 Renwick,

12:40.093 --> 12:42.796
and given the wager
that we made...

12:42.829 --> 12:44.097
Let's see who can
get a buyer first.

12:44.130 --> 12:45.699
- Whoa.
- Come on.

12:45.732 --> 12:47.434
So you wanna make a bet?

12:47.467 --> 12:50.170
I thought it was a good time
for a little check-in.

12:52.339 --> 12:53.973
- Hi.
- Hi!

12:54.007 --> 12:55.508
What's up?

12:55.542 --> 12:57.577
- I brought you a present.
- Why?

12:57.610 --> 13:00.613
I invited Olivia
to co-list not one,

13:00.647 --> 13:03.249
but two penthouses with me.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.318
And then I let her take the lead

13:05.352 --> 13:07.053
on the more expensive one.

13:07.087 --> 13:09.689
I thought I was being
super-awesome.

13:09.723 --> 13:12.058
Olivia didn't really
see it that way,

13:12.058 --> 13:14.527
and she had to turn it into this
whole crazy competition.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.529
If I get a buyer
for penthouse one,

13:16.563 --> 13:18.665
you wear a bunny suit,
and you can be my assistant

13:18.698 --> 13:19.933
for an entire day.

13:19.966 --> 13:23.737
If I win, you will jump
into the Hudson river.

13:23.770 --> 13:26.639
Hey, it was her idea,
not mine.

13:26.673 --> 13:29.075
I'm nervous.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.111
Whatever's in here is
not going to be good.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.445
Why? What are you
talking about?

13:32.479 --> 13:33.913
Why would you give me
a nice present?

13:33.947 --> 13:35.315
I'm generous.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.161
What is this?

13:48.194 --> 13:49.262
That's a bathing suit.

13:49.295 --> 13:51.331
- Is this a joke?
- And this is a cap.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.600
Can you put this on?
So your hair doesn't get wet.

13:53.633 --> 13:56.536
So what are you telling me?
You sold penthouse three?

13:56.569 --> 13:57.871
Yes, I did.

13:57.904 --> 13:59.873
- To who?
- Just some dude.

13:59.906 --> 14:01.307
Some dude?

14:01.341 --> 14:02.509
What do you think?

14:02.542 --> 14:03.743
I think it's a really
pretty apartment.

14:03.777 --> 14:05.545
What do you think
about living here?

14:05.578 --> 14:06.880
What are you saying?

14:06.913 --> 14:09.683
I think we should buy it.

14:09.716 --> 14:12.752
I'm just very good
at selling.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.321
Let's move on.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.823
Let's go jump
in the Hudson River.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.793
I mean, I'll accept the defeat
if it's truly defeat, but...

14:19.826 --> 14:20.960
- Check--
- It seems a little funky.

14:21.061 --> 14:21.961
This is funky.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.663
Check the deed,
check public record.

14:23.697 --> 14:24.964
It just recorded.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.332
Even if I do jump
in the Hudson--

14:26.366 --> 14:28.435
which if I'm really beat
by you, I will--

14:28.468 --> 14:30.737
I'm not wearing this, so--

14:31.905 --> 14:33.873
You don't want to wear this?
I tried this on.

14:33.907 --> 14:34.874
Oh, my God.
- But you pull it

14:34.908 --> 14:37.177
over your ears,
and this will keep

14:37.210 --> 14:39.946
all the gasoline and urine
and feces

14:39.979 --> 14:42.415
that are in the Hudson River
outside of your hair.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.984
Did you really--you--
you got a buyer?

14:45.085 --> 14:45.985
Of course I did.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.187
I still can't really
believe it.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.588
I sell everything.
What's wrong with you?

14:50.156 --> 14:52.258
I don't know why you even
agreed to this bet.

14:52.292 --> 14:53.293
Can you take that off?

14:53.326 --> 14:55.428
It looks like you got
a facelift.

14:55.462 --> 14:56.463
Oh.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.732
Okay, I'm sorry.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.235
I'm gonna check the recording,
like you said...

15:02.268 --> 15:03.303
- You should. Do it.
- And make sure

15:03.336 --> 15:04.804
that this is all
fair game.

15:04.838 --> 15:05.805
Do it.

15:05.839 --> 15:07.941
I don't know why
she's so upset.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.743
This is a co-listing.

15:09.776 --> 15:11.344
She still gets
half the commission.

15:11.378 --> 15:14.581
Olivia. Olivia.
Olivia.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.116
- Come on.
- It's fine, it's fine.

15:16.149 --> 15:17.384
Olivia,
you don't like this?

15:17.417 --> 15:19.419
It's got, like, the ruffles,
and everything.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.454
I got to go make a deal.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.890
You don't like
the ruffles?

15:28.161 --> 15:30.497
Cheers.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.868
So?

15:34.901 --> 15:36.836
[sighs]
So?

15:36.870 --> 15:38.972
So?

15:39.072 --> 15:40.407
How's business?

15:43.243 --> 15:46.379
(Fredrik)
Not surprisingly, my developers
called me to get an update.

15:46.413 --> 15:50.350
They're anxious to get an offer.
Unfortunately, I don't have one.

15:50.383 --> 15:53.953
So, guys,
$22.5 million townhouses,

15:53.987 --> 15:55.422
they don't sell
that often.

15:55.455 --> 15:59.592
Do you think that the house
doesn't command that value?

15:59.626 --> 16:03.396
I think 22.5--I always said so--
is very, very high.

16:03.430 --> 16:06.299
Price point might be high
if we didn't

16:06.332 --> 16:10.603
put in every last bell
and whistle that you asked for.

16:17.911 --> 16:22.415
I'm trying, with you, to create
a new price category here.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.783
We're setting a record.

16:23.817 --> 16:27.120
The only thing that
I need now is time.

16:27.153 --> 16:30.223
I can understand if my developer
is starting to be impatient.

16:30.256 --> 16:32.959
I mean, they just spent
millions and millions of dollars

16:33.059 --> 16:35.328
on the finishes
that I told them they needed,

16:35.362 --> 16:38.064
and yet, they haven't
seen any result.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.733
But you know what?
They will.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.434
They just need
to trust me.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.269
Fredrik, you don't have
a lot of time.

16:45.638 --> 16:46.639
You have one week.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.342
The list agreement
is expiring,

16:49.376 --> 16:51.344
but you are gonna
re-sign me, on--

16:54.814 --> 16:56.082
- At least give me, like...
- We're not--we're not--

16:56.082 --> 16:57.183
Another 60 days,
because--

16:57.217 --> 16:59.819
No.
You get a week.

16:59.853 --> 17:03.356
I have been on this for months.
I am part of this house.

17:03.390 --> 17:06.459
I put Fredrik Eklund's soul
into the walls of this house.

17:06.493 --> 17:07.861
You gotta renew.

17:07.894 --> 17:10.030
Seven more days, and then
you're gonna terminate me?

17:10.063 --> 17:11.031
I hope you're joking.

17:11.064 --> 17:12.232
We're not joking.

17:14.534 --> 17:19.439
We're feeling like you feel like
this is some endless process,

17:19.472 --> 17:21.174
and when it happens,
it happens.

17:21.207 --> 17:24.644
It is not endless,
it's coming to an end--

17:24.678 --> 17:27.514
In seven days, for you.

17:27.547 --> 17:30.150
I can't even remember
the last time I was this angry,

17:30.183 --> 17:32.318
sitting across the table
from a developer.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.587
If I wasn't Fredrik,
I would walk away,

17:34.621 --> 17:37.424
like any other broker would
at this moment.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.592
But I'm Fredrik,
and I don't walk away.

17:39.626 --> 17:42.562
In fact, what I'm gonna do here
is quite the opposite.

17:42.595 --> 17:43.630
I'm gonna sell that house,

17:43.663 --> 17:45.198
I'm gonna collect
that commission,

17:45.231 --> 17:49.069
and I'm gonna make them regret
that they ever doubted me.

17:52.105 --> 17:55.275
Sorry I haven't been able
to get back to you so much.

17:55.308 --> 17:56.343
I've been in the hospital.

18:06.553 --> 18:10.557
Hello?
Victor, are you...on?

18:13.093 --> 18:15.628
Maybe I should move this
a little out of the--

18:15.662 --> 18:18.031
Nope, nope.

18:18.031 --> 18:20.467
- [mumbling]
[doorbell ringing]

18:20.500 --> 18:21.935
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you, Ryan?

18:22.035 --> 18:23.269
(both)
Good to see you.

18:23.303 --> 18:28.041
So welcome to the 39th floor
of One 57 West 57th.

18:28.074 --> 18:30.110
Thank you.

18:30.143 --> 18:31.344
You know the building.

18:31.378 --> 18:33.146
I do, I'm very familiar
with the building.

18:33.179 --> 18:35.915
When I get a listing
as exclusive as this one,

18:35.949 --> 18:38.418
I start with a short list
of brokers

18:38.451 --> 18:42.789
who cater to an equally
exclusive brand of clientele.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.357
Tell me what
your buyer's like.

18:44.391 --> 18:45.859
They're a foreign investor.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.761
It's a couple, they're
currently on Fifth Avenue.

18:47.794 --> 18:50.063
They absolutely want
Central Park views.

18:52.098 --> 18:54.267
We don't really have
a clear view of Central Park.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.870
We're kind of facing right
into that hotel right there.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.840
Well, that didn't
take long.

19:00.874 --> 19:02.509
What floor would you
be at

19:02.542 --> 19:04.344
to clear Essex House
in this building?

19:04.377 --> 19:06.012
I think another ten floors
or so.

19:06.046 --> 19:09.215
Sometimes you can hide
an apartment's flaws.

19:09.249 --> 19:12.118
Other times,
unless you're David Copperfield,

19:12.152 --> 19:14.020
there's not a whole lot
you can do.

19:14.020 --> 19:18.291
In this case, my job is to steer
attention towards the positives.

19:18.324 --> 19:22.362
Luckily, this apartment
has a lot of them.

19:25.231 --> 19:28.668
Huge master bedroom suite.
Velvet on the walls.

19:28.702 --> 19:31.371
Oh, wow, I thought it was
Venetian plaster.

19:31.404 --> 19:32.806
These are Smallbone kitchens,

19:32.839 --> 19:34.674
beautiful zebrawood paneling
throughout.

19:34.708 --> 19:35.842
It's got a nice
lacquer finish,

19:35.875 --> 19:37.911
so you actually have
reflections of the park

19:37.944 --> 19:39.579
when you're looking
into the wood.

19:39.612 --> 19:42.182
And they wrapped the television
around the concrete pole.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.286
(woman)
What is the ceiling height here?

19:46.319 --> 19:48.588
Ceiling height here
is just over 10 feet.

19:48.621 --> 19:51.057
And he did the coffered ceiling?
All of this is custom?

19:51.057 --> 19:52.459
Yup, all this was custom.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.594
The seller actually,
even before moving in--

19:54.627 --> 19:56.329
and I know it's crazy,
'cause it's brand new--

19:56.363 --> 19:57.464
did a bunch of renovations.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.403
And then this is
my favorite part.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.308
This is stunning.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.477
(woman)
They did a great job
with the paneling.

20:10.510 --> 20:11.845
It's very spacious.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.046
Very, very,
very luxurious,

20:13.079 --> 20:14.748
and that's what this building's
all about.

20:14.781 --> 20:17.317
(Ryan voice-over)
The renovations that the owner
made to this unit

20:17.350 --> 20:20.353
are tailor-made
for the 1-percenters,

20:20.387 --> 20:22.856
and so is the decor.

20:25.959 --> 20:27.594
The price includes
all the furnishings?

20:27.627 --> 20:30.930
Yes, so you just kind of show up
with very expensive fur coats,

20:30.964 --> 20:32.399
and you're good to go.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.800
(Ryan voice-over)
Shortly after
the listing appointment,

20:33.833 --> 20:37.671
Victor called back and said
that mainly out of convenience,

20:37.704 --> 20:41.574
the owner was willing to throw
in all of the furnishings

20:41.608 --> 20:45.045
for the listing price
that we already agreed to.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.913
Look, I'm gonna be honest.
I don't know

20:46.946 --> 20:48.748
if they're gonna be okay
with the obstruction.

20:48.782 --> 20:50.483
It's just a matter
of whether

20:50.517 --> 20:52.385
the view is gonna be
right for them.

20:52.419 --> 20:53.753
We have a lot of options
right now.

20:53.787 --> 20:55.422
There's a lot of new
construction going up,

20:55.455 --> 20:57.557
and I think we have to
at least look

20:57.590 --> 20:59.659
at some of these
other options.

20:59.693 --> 21:02.262
Even two years ago
when this place was first built,

21:02.295 --> 21:04.931
there weren't a ton of options
at this price point,

21:04.964 --> 21:08.301
but with all of these new towers
popping up,

21:08.335 --> 21:11.171
there's actually a surplus
of inventory right now

21:11.204 --> 21:12.972
in the super luxury market.

21:13.073 --> 21:14.407
You've got views
from Central Park

21:14.441 --> 21:15.709
from literally every angle.

21:15.742 --> 21:17.510
Great views of the building
here?

21:17.544 --> 21:20.146
- Listen, it's New York.
- [laughs]

21:20.180 --> 21:21.881
Right?
What do you want me to do?

21:26.119 --> 21:27.987
[phone ringing]

21:28.988 --> 21:31.091
Hi, Brian,
this is Fredrik.

21:31.091 --> 21:34.160
The townhouse in West Village
on Saturday?

21:36.896 --> 21:38.398
It hasn't been easy
to get people

21:38.431 --> 21:40.100
even through the door
of this townhouse--

21:40.133 --> 21:42.168
between the price tag
and the market changing--

21:42.202 --> 21:46.106
but I had one
last-minute showing request

21:46.139 --> 21:47.340
over the weekend.

21:47.374 --> 21:49.109
Big businessman
on his way to Europe,

21:49.109 --> 21:51.444
and he had to see the house
before he left.

21:51.478 --> 21:53.747
You have to admit,
it's pretty awesome, that house.

21:56.950 --> 21:59.419
Already negotiating,
I see.

22:00.687 --> 22:01.654
(Brian)
Yes.

22:01.688 --> 22:02.889
Judging of all the interest
we have

22:02.922 --> 22:05.759
and the two second showings
I have tomorrow,

22:05.792 --> 22:07.360
I think it's gonna go now.

22:16.936 --> 22:19.072
Well, first of all,
I'm not chasing you.

22:19.072 --> 22:21.241
Secondly, I'm trying
to do you a favor.

22:24.911 --> 22:26.880
[whispering]
Whoa.

22:26.913 --> 22:29.916
I like you. I like your style,
I like the way you think.

22:29.949 --> 22:31.951
(Fredrik voice-over)
I like that you don't have
a broker.

22:31.985 --> 22:34.454
Did someone say
double commission?

22:34.487 --> 22:36.589
So let's do this dance.
Give me an offer.

22:50.270 --> 22:51.638
Heh.

22:51.671 --> 22:54.307
There's only one person
that can make this happen,

22:54.341 --> 22:56.276
and that's you.

22:56.309 --> 22:57.844
Think of the house.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.813
There's only one way to live
in your life,

22:59.846 --> 23:01.681
and that's perfection.

23:01.715 --> 23:05.418
I saw it when I shook your hand,
I felt it, shaking your hand,

23:05.452 --> 23:07.387
and I can hear it
in your voice now.

23:07.420 --> 23:10.056
Perfection, perfection,
perfection.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.725
This house is perfection.

23:19.432 --> 23:22.102
You have my number,
now you can text the offer.

23:23.470 --> 23:26.106
Looking forward to hearing
from you again.

23:26.139 --> 23:27.907
Whew.

23:29.509 --> 23:32.579
He could be the one.
I have a good feeling.

23:43.289 --> 23:44.891
I'll be right back
with your menus.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.226
Actually,
water will be fine.

23:46.259 --> 23:48.395
I don't think I'm gonna eat.
Thank you.

23:48.428 --> 23:51.931
(Luis voice-over)
Right now, I am supposed to be
having dinner with my mother.

23:51.965 --> 23:55.168
This is the last chance I have
to spend time with her

23:55.201 --> 23:56.870
before she leaves,

23:56.903 --> 24:00.340
and now Richard Hamilton
decides to call?

24:00.373 --> 24:02.842
He has not called
for a week and a half,

24:02.876 --> 24:05.645
and now, two hours
before my dinner with my mother,

24:05.679 --> 24:07.914
he asks me to come
meet him for dinner?

24:07.947 --> 24:09.049
Can I get a coffee?

24:09.049 --> 24:10.050
Sure.

24:10.050 --> 24:11.451
Thank you.

24:11.484 --> 24:14.454
[suspenseful music]

24:14.487 --> 24:22.495
* *

24:31.071 --> 24:33.139
Hey, Luis,
how are you doing?

24:36.076 --> 24:38.111
How are you?
Please, sit.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.346
I'll get it.

24:39.379 --> 24:41.748
Oops.
[chuckles]

24:41.781 --> 24:45.118
Ahh.
How you been?

24:45.151 --> 24:46.953
What's going on?

24:46.986 --> 24:50.256
I'm sorry I haven't been able
to get back to you so much.

24:50.290 --> 24:53.426
I've been in the hospital.

24:53.460 --> 24:59.532
They want to do heart surgery,
lung surgery, and liver surgery,

24:59.566 --> 25:02.502
which could involve
transplanting all three.

25:04.270 --> 25:06.139
The chance of coming through
all of them

25:06.172 --> 25:08.174
might not be that good.

25:10.276 --> 25:12.579
I feel so ignorant.

25:14.714 --> 25:17.317
Richard didn't look like
the healthiest guy in the world,

25:17.350 --> 25:20.086
but I didn't know
he was sick.

25:20.120 --> 25:23.523
I am so sorry, Rich.

25:23.556 --> 25:26.659
I had no idea. I've been
calling you like crazy.

25:26.693 --> 25:29.062
Don't worry about that.

25:29.062 --> 25:30.964
The good news is,
we're still on.

25:34.968 --> 25:36.236
Offer.

25:39.773 --> 25:41.174
Forget about the deal.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.442
I mean, that doesn't--that's
the last thing that matters.

25:42.475 --> 25:44.110
No, don't forget the deal.
We never forget the deal.

25:44.144 --> 25:45.412
[laughs]

25:50.717 --> 25:55.088
I was caring so much about this
before I came here, and...

25:55.121 --> 26:00.493
$80,000, $100,000, $1 million,
who gives a f***?

26:00.527 --> 26:03.029
You know, one thing
I'd tell you is,

26:03.029 --> 26:06.066
go home and hug
the one you love.

26:13.373 --> 26:15.642
and...

26:20.313 --> 26:24.651
Whew.
[chuckles]

26:24.684 --> 26:26.820
Oh, f***.

26:26.853 --> 26:29.055
[sighs]

26:29.055 --> 26:30.123
You're a good guy.

26:30.156 --> 26:31.124
We're gonna get
this deal done,

26:31.157 --> 26:32.559
and that's gonna make me
happy too.

26:32.592 --> 26:34.661
I even forgot that we had a deal
that we were working on, but--

26:34.694 --> 26:36.629
We got a deal.
I like my deals.

26:36.663 --> 26:38.698
Can I read the terms?

26:38.732 --> 26:41.167
$2.9 million, 3% each.

26:41.201 --> 26:43.403
How about 4% for me
and 2% for you?

26:43.436 --> 26:44.838
3 and 3, Papa.

26:44.871 --> 26:46.206
[laughs]

26:46.239 --> 26:48.875
My life moves so fast,

26:48.908 --> 26:51.244
but once in a while,
moments like this

26:51.277 --> 26:54.948
make you stop and realize
what really is important.

26:54.981 --> 26:57.250
Go call your mom.
[laughs]

26:57.283 --> 26:59.285
You have no idea.

27:00.286 --> 27:01.287
[siren blaring]

27:01.321 --> 27:03.023
(Luis)
I was sitting with a client.

27:03.023 --> 27:05.258
I started getting pains
in my chest.

27:11.031 --> 27:12.032
[door closing]

27:12.032 --> 27:14.167
[singsong]
Hi, how are you?

27:14.200 --> 27:16.336
- Wah!
- [singsong] Fantastic!

27:16.369 --> 27:17.671
- How are you?
- I think we--from now on,

27:17.704 --> 27:19.606
on this team, everybody
should talk like that.

27:19.639 --> 27:22.142
* How are you, Jordan? *

27:22.175 --> 27:24.077
* I am fine, Fredrik *

27:24.110 --> 27:25.645
No, you have to have
higher pitch.

27:25.679 --> 27:27.814
[high voice]
* I am fine, Fredrik *

27:27.847 --> 27:30.450
[high voice]
* I am fine, Fredrik *

27:30.483 --> 27:32.218
* Are we doing any new deal-- *

27:32.252 --> 27:34.220
What?

27:34.254 --> 27:37.323
196 new emails.
I mean, this is my life.

27:37.357 --> 27:39.259
- Closing.
- Well, you're a busy boy.

27:39.292 --> 27:40.326
That's what happens.

27:49.436 --> 27:51.237
(Ryan)
R.D., did you get them
on the phone?

27:51.271 --> 27:52.639
They won't return calls.

27:52.672 --> 27:54.507
Keep working on that.
That is your mission.

27:54.541 --> 27:56.543
Okay.

27:57.544 --> 27:59.512
[knocking]

27:59.546 --> 28:04.551
Can you explain, why are we
getting mail from 22 Renwick?

28:06.252 --> 28:10.824
Located at 156 Reed Street.
I think that's our address here.

28:12.025 --> 28:13.159
What is a Puffer Munkin?

28:13.193 --> 28:15.695
I'm just curious if you know.
I'm just asking.

28:17.731 --> 28:19.332
Why don't you just open it
in front of me?

28:19.366 --> 28:21.034
You--
I don't want to open it.

28:21.034 --> 28:22.469
- Just open it.
- Why?

28:22.502 --> 28:24.604
It involves me if it
has to do with 22 Renwick.

28:27.073 --> 28:30.043
Strange that they would
send something here.

28:32.712 --> 28:36.149
There's nothing in here.
It's empty.

28:38.685 --> 28:41.054
Don't you want to go swimming?
Where's the bathing suit?

28:41.087 --> 28:42.655
Depending on what
this means...

28:42.689 --> 28:43.656
Yeah.

28:43.690 --> 28:45.759
You could be wearing
a bunny suit.

28:45.792 --> 28:49.095
Olivia is a incredibly
competitive person.

28:49.129 --> 28:52.232
There's no...
furniture.

29:00.206 --> 29:01.841
I want Olivia to succeed.

29:01.875 --> 29:03.309
I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this.

29:03.343 --> 29:06.246
This listing is
a huge opportunity for her,

29:06.279 --> 29:08.615
and if she knew
the bet was over,

29:08.648 --> 29:10.684
it might take away
some of the edge.

29:10.717 --> 29:12.085
Maybe just a little,

29:12.118 --> 29:14.054
but just enough
to make a difference.

29:14.087 --> 29:16.022
There's definitely
something in here.

29:16.022 --> 29:17.691
I didn't even see that.

29:19.626 --> 29:21.161
Huh.

29:21.194 --> 29:22.595
"Dear new resident,

29:22.629 --> 29:24.931
please see the attached payment
for the bylaws."

29:25.031 --> 29:26.199
I think I figured it out.

29:26.232 --> 29:30.203
The new resident
works in this office.

29:30.236 --> 29:33.940
You are good, and also
disqualified, so--

29:34.040 --> 29:35.842
Disqualified from what?

29:35.875 --> 29:37.210
I'm not disqualified
from anything.

29:37.243 --> 29:39.479
You're absolutely
disqualified.

29:39.512 --> 29:41.848
You clearly bought
Penthouse Three.

29:43.216 --> 29:48.455
The bet was, whoever sold
their penthouse first wins.

29:48.488 --> 29:52.926
There was no caveat
as to who they could sell it to.

29:52.959 --> 29:56.363
I could've sold it to myself.
I'm a human being.

29:56.396 --> 29:58.531
I can't work with you if you're
gonna pull stuff like this.

29:58.565 --> 29:59.632
I said that Penthouse Three
sold.

29:59.666 --> 30:00.934
Did Penthouse Three sell?
Yes, it did.

30:00.967 --> 30:03.403
I asked you
who the buyer was.

30:03.436 --> 30:06.039
The buyer is a limited liability
corporation.

30:06.072 --> 30:08.708
I literally have been having
nightmares about the Hudson.

30:08.742 --> 30:11.111
You don't have to
go swimming.

30:11.144 --> 30:14.114
I will not let her actually
jump in the Hudson River,

30:14.147 --> 30:17.550
because I'm not insane.
At least not that insane,

30:17.584 --> 30:21.154
and I care about her safety,
and she's very valuable to me,

30:21.187 --> 30:22.455
and I need her
to keep selling things,

30:22.489 --> 30:24.457
because that's how
I make money.

30:25.892 --> 30:27.160
- I'm not happy about this.
- Mm-hmm.

30:27.193 --> 30:29.696
I'm kind of happy,
'cause now it means

30:29.729 --> 30:30.797
that you have to wear
a bunny suit

30:30.830 --> 30:33.299
and do stuff for me
all day long.

30:33.333 --> 30:35.969
You can get me lunch,
drive me around too.

30:36.002 --> 30:39.005
I'm not getting in a bunny suit
and then driving you around.

30:39.039 --> 30:40.440
I know you secretly want to.

30:40.473 --> 30:43.076
I don't secretly want
to do any of that.

30:43.109 --> 30:44.944
If you are
into Puffer Munkins,

30:44.978 --> 30:46.846
you're probably
into bunny suits.

30:46.880 --> 30:48.948
I think the task worked.

30:48.982 --> 30:52.018
Look how strong you are
right now, very assertive.

30:52.052 --> 30:53.253
I'm gonna be
even more assertive

30:53.286 --> 30:54.554
when you're doing errands
for me.

30:54.587 --> 30:55.555
Good.
Let's do it.

30:55.588 --> 30:56.556
So you're excited?

30:56.589 --> 30:57.557
No.

30:57.590 --> 30:58.591
R.D., are you excited?

31:08.201 --> 31:10.570
Hi, guys, how are you?

31:10.603 --> 31:12.272
Fredrik, how are you?

31:13.707 --> 31:17.077
I don't think my developers
were expecting to see me

31:17.077 --> 31:20.080
so soon after our little
sit-down at the cafe,

31:20.080 --> 31:23.350
but I'm happy
to disappoint them.

31:23.383 --> 31:25.085
Tell us why you're here.

31:27.721 --> 31:31.291
I'm here to extend
a leaf

31:31.324 --> 31:33.993
with a really beautiful offer
on it.

31:34.094 --> 31:35.829
Interesting.

31:35.862 --> 31:38.531
You're telling us
that you have a prospect.

31:47.874 --> 31:53.413
My client came
to the house...

31:53.446 --> 31:56.149
and put in the offer.

31:56.182 --> 32:03.056
They offer all cash,
immediate closing.

32:03.056 --> 32:05.625
$19 1/2 million.

32:08.862 --> 32:14.200
19.5 is a long way
from 22.5.

32:14.234 --> 32:17.470
So what's your plan
to get us to full price?

32:17.504 --> 32:19.472
It's not gonna happen at 22.5.
It's just not gonna happen.

32:19.506 --> 32:21.341
Let's not be stupid now.

32:21.374 --> 32:24.377
Let's give him a counter
that feels like a counter,

32:24.411 --> 32:25.845
or he's gonna walk.

32:28.815 --> 32:31.985
What do you think
a reasonable counter is?

32:32.085 --> 32:35.789
Let's counter 22.
We are coming down $500,000,

32:35.822 --> 32:37.791
See what happens.

32:37.824 --> 32:40.927
Cash buyer,
willing to close immediately.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.228
And don't play this game
with me.

32:42.262 --> 32:45.098
I know you're excited,
I can see it.

32:45.098 --> 32:46.633
What--
is that a heartbeat?

32:46.666 --> 32:47.734
No.

32:47.767 --> 32:48.868
Well, it was.
It was my own...

32:52.639 --> 32:57.310
Fine, 22.
Let's see what you can do.

33:00.847 --> 33:02.182
[inaudible]

33:02.215 --> 33:03.683
It's his last chance.

33:08.054 --> 33:10.724
[inaudible]

33:13.059 --> 33:14.794
It's kind of nice to see him
sweating a little bit.

33:14.828 --> 33:17.764
It is.

33:22.535 --> 33:23.903
He's getting ready
to give us a big offer.

33:23.937 --> 33:26.873
Oh, the anticipation.

33:26.906 --> 33:29.709
I got him up to...

33:29.743 --> 33:31.978
$20.5 million.

33:35.515 --> 33:37.283
That's huge,
$20 million!

33:38.284 --> 33:40.553
It's huge.

33:40.587 --> 33:42.856
$2 million under ask
still.

33:42.889 --> 33:44.357
This is what's
gonna happen now,

33:44.391 --> 33:46.426
I'm gonna step outside
one last time.

33:46.459 --> 33:49.329
If I don't return in here,
we're done.

33:49.362 --> 33:52.265
The listing agreement is
expiring in 72--

33:52.298 --> 33:56.202
Actually, 71 hours.
I gotta make this happen now.

33:56.236 --> 33:59.239
[inaudible]

34:01.341 --> 34:02.642
Oh, is this the right room?

34:02.676 --> 34:04.377
Do we have something
to talk about?

34:13.053 --> 34:16.456
I'm happy to announce...

34:16.489 --> 34:18.525
$21 million.

34:18.558 --> 34:20.560
$21 million?

34:22.729 --> 34:25.799
Yes.

34:25.832 --> 34:28.601
I don't know,
do we need to reconsider 21?

34:28.635 --> 34:29.602
What?

34:29.636 --> 34:31.738
He got there
pretty quickly.

34:31.771 --> 34:33.073
(Fredrik)
Do we live on the same planet?

34:33.106 --> 34:34.541
Do we both live
in New York City?

34:34.574 --> 34:37.077
$21 million for a townhouse
in the West Village

34:37.077 --> 34:38.178
would be a record--

34:38.211 --> 34:39.846
a record this year,
a record last year.

34:39.879 --> 34:42.115
It's an amazing price.

34:42.148 --> 34:44.451
Let me remind you guys,
he doesn't have a broker.

34:46.486 --> 34:48.988
Take the $21 million,

34:49.089 --> 34:51.558
and I'm gonna let you keep
half the commission.

34:51.591 --> 34:54.094
You're saving 3%.

34:54.094 --> 34:55.829
That's $600,000.

34:59.265 --> 35:01.701
Guess what?

35:01.735 --> 35:04.037
Congratulations.
We have a deal.

35:04.037 --> 35:05.538
- Really?
(Jared) You did a good job.

35:05.572 --> 35:07.040
(Tom) Thank you.
- You had to be pushed

35:07.040 --> 35:08.041
at the end,
you did a great job.

35:08.041 --> 35:09.642
Thank you.

35:09.676 --> 35:11.277
(Fredrik)
Well, I'm sure most brokers
would love to pocket

35:11.311 --> 35:13.146
another record-breaking
commission,

35:13.179 --> 35:14.748
but I'd rather,
honestly,

35:14.781 --> 35:17.917
set another record
sales price-wise for a client,

35:17.951 --> 35:19.753
which I think
I just did.

35:19.786 --> 35:21.321
- Thank you.
(Tom) Thank you.

35:21.354 --> 35:23.056
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Fredrik.

35:23.056 --> 35:25.592
(Fredrik)
I will admit,
not even I was sure

35:25.625 --> 35:30.163
that I was gonna pull this off,
but you know what?

35:30.196 --> 35:31.364
I win.

35:31.398 --> 35:32.632
Bye.

35:38.838 --> 35:42.075
[doorbell ringing]

35:42.075 --> 35:43.443
- Aaron.
- Luis.

35:43.476 --> 35:44.477
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

35:44.511 --> 35:45.478
Thank you very much
for coming in.

35:45.512 --> 35:46.479
Welcome, welcome.

35:46.513 --> 35:47.847
Thank you.

35:47.881 --> 35:49.082
Have a seat.
Can I offer you something?

35:49.082 --> 35:50.250
I'm good, but thank you.

35:51.451 --> 35:52.452
[sighs]

35:55.121 --> 35:57.123
How are you?

36:00.527 --> 36:02.362
(Luis voice-over)
The dinner with Richard Hamilton

36:02.395 --> 36:05.598
had a very, very strong impact
on me.

36:05.632 --> 36:08.168
I'm sorry I haven't been able
to get back to you so much.

36:08.201 --> 36:09.569
I've been in the hospital.

36:09.602 --> 36:12.739
The chance of coming through
might not be that good.

36:12.772 --> 36:15.642
I haven't been able
to stop thinking about him,

36:15.675 --> 36:18.945
and it's making me think about
how I am living my own life.

36:21.047 --> 36:22.515
Eat lunch!

36:22.549 --> 36:24.751
I don't take care of myself.

36:30.056 --> 36:33.193
When my mother was here,
she tried to bring this up,

36:33.226 --> 36:34.828
and I kind of blew her off,

36:34.861 --> 36:37.130
but I don't want
to blow it off anymore.

36:37.163 --> 36:38.732
For the very first time
in my life,

36:38.765 --> 36:40.967
I've realized
I need help.

36:44.270 --> 36:45.939
I'm stressing myself
to the point

36:45.972 --> 36:49.109
that I-I don't sleep,
I don't eat.

36:54.080 --> 36:56.216
What are you doing?

36:56.249 --> 36:58.852
The other day,
I had a panic attack.

36:58.885 --> 37:00.787
And I went
to the hospital.

37:03.757 --> 37:05.525
(Luis voice-over)
I was sitting with a client,

37:05.558 --> 37:08.495
I started getting pains
in my chest.

37:08.528 --> 37:11.031
The doctor said
that I was very close

37:11.031 --> 37:13.600
to having a heart attack.

37:13.633 --> 37:18.872
It was the scariest experience
of my entire life.

37:20.173 --> 37:22.542
I thought
I was going to die.

37:22.575 --> 37:24.044
That's serious.

37:24.077 --> 37:26.546
Listen, I'm very self aware,
of all the things

37:26.579 --> 37:30.183
that I'm capable of bringing
to the world,

37:30.216 --> 37:33.053
but I want to be,
like, so great in life,

37:33.053 --> 37:35.722
and I have the ability.

37:35.755 --> 37:38.958
But if you don't put the things
in place to support you

37:39.059 --> 37:44.597
as you grow, you're not gonna
realize those visions.

37:44.631 --> 37:46.866
You don't know
what balance is.

37:46.900 --> 37:49.235
[sighs]
What is balance?

37:49.269 --> 37:51.304
What's the longest time span
you've gone

37:51.338 --> 37:53.873
without answering
a business text message,

37:53.907 --> 37:56.242
a business email,
or a business phone call?

37:56.276 --> 37:59.079
Probably the length
of this conversation.

37:59.079 --> 38:00.680
That's the lack of balance.

38:04.117 --> 38:06.186
[sniffs]
So what do I do?

38:06.219 --> 38:07.821
How do I fix this?

38:07.854 --> 38:12.092
Step one, I want you
to meditate every morning.

38:12.125 --> 38:13.093
Seriously?

38:13.126 --> 38:14.361
Sit back.

38:15.562 --> 38:16.563
Sit back.

38:18.264 --> 38:19.499
Now close your eyes.

38:19.532 --> 38:21.868
[sighs]

38:21.901 --> 38:23.470
Now I want you to take
a deep breath in

38:23.503 --> 38:25.572
from your belly.

38:25.605 --> 38:27.674
I'm thinking about a deal
that I couldn't close.

38:27.707 --> 38:28.775
Let that go.

38:28.808 --> 38:30.377
Stop.

38:30.410 --> 38:32.645
And just breathe.

38:33.713 --> 38:37.150
[breathes deeply]

38:37.183 --> 38:38.385
Again.

38:38.418 --> 38:41.421
[breathes deeply]

38:44.924 --> 38:47.894
[breathes deeply]

38:47.927 --> 38:50.930
Now open your eyes.

38:55.135 --> 38:57.170
What did you just do?
[laughs]

38:57.203 --> 38:58.838
You got present.

39:00.840 --> 39:04.077
I have realized
that when I'm somewhere,

39:04.110 --> 39:06.446
I'm already thinking
where I should be,

39:06.479 --> 39:08.815
and I'm not there.

39:08.848 --> 39:10.250
Look how ironic it is.

39:10.283 --> 39:12.252
For a guy who's
so much in love with life,

39:12.285 --> 39:15.922
he is not present.

39:16.022 --> 39:17.891
It feels like
nothing else matters

39:17.924 --> 39:19.325
except what's
in front of you.

39:20.860 --> 39:22.862
Wow.

39:25.765 --> 39:27.367
[chuckles]

39:27.400 --> 39:29.636
Wow, thank you so much.
Okay, I like this, I like this.

39:29.669 --> 39:31.705
Let's do this every week.

39:31.738 --> 39:32.906
- You're ready?
- Yes.

39:32.939 --> 39:36.042
Come,
I need to hug you, man.

39:36.042 --> 39:37.344
These are happy tears,
by the way.

39:37.377 --> 39:38.478
These are good tears.

39:38.511 --> 39:41.247
Oh, my God,
this emotional Puerto Rican!

39:41.281 --> 39:42.349
[laughs]

39:44.718 --> 39:47.520
[laughter]
- Oh, my God, that's so good.

39:52.926 --> 39:54.928
Okay.
Ugh.

39:57.263 --> 39:58.431
[car horn honks.

39:58.465 --> 40:01.935
This is ridiculous.
Someone's gonna hit me.

40:01.968 --> 40:03.370
Hello.

40:10.443 --> 40:12.479
What's up, Doc?

40:16.983 --> 40:19.019
[laughter]

40:19.052 --> 40:21.388
Oh, my God,
that's so good.

40:21.421 --> 40:24.557
Olivia feels that I cheated
on the bet we made.

40:24.591 --> 40:25.992
This is Ryan's to-do list
for the day.

40:26.026 --> 40:27.260
What?

40:27.293 --> 40:28.928
(Ryan voice-over)
And if Olivia feels that way--

40:28.962 --> 40:31.598
because I am
the coolest boss ever--

40:31.631 --> 40:33.466
I am willing
to subject myself

40:33.500 --> 40:36.336
to the humiliation
of a bunny suit.

40:36.369 --> 40:38.438
Good luck and I will
see you soon.

40:49.249 --> 40:51.718
"Cut my chicken."
Perfect.

40:51.751 --> 40:53.586
Hi.

40:54.988 --> 40:57.323
Do you have a chicken salad
with cut-up chicken?

40:58.792 --> 41:00.360
Do you think someone's really
gonna, like, give me coffee

41:00.393 --> 41:01.561
if I walk in
wearing this hat?

41:01.594 --> 41:02.629
Just tip really well.

41:02.662 --> 41:03.697
I don't even have pockets.

41:03.730 --> 41:04.764
Where am I supposed to keep
my money,

41:04.798 --> 41:06.700
like, in my rabbit pouch?

41:08.868 --> 41:09.869
Great.

41:10.870 --> 41:12.072
Thanks.

41:13.440 --> 41:15.108
[doorbell jingling]

41:15.141 --> 41:18.211
So coffee.
Need some tampons.

41:18.244 --> 41:19.479
That'll be great.

41:19.512 --> 41:21.981
[doorbell jingling]

41:24.517 --> 41:27.721
It's hard out here
for a bunny.

41:30.590 --> 41:33.560
Okay.
I'm back.

41:33.593 --> 41:35.595
- Here's your coffee.
- Thank you.

41:35.628 --> 41:37.497
Two sugars, no milk, that's
exactly what you asked for.

41:37.530 --> 41:38.531
- Making sure.
- This is a salad

41:38.565 --> 41:40.200
with cut-up chicken.

41:40.233 --> 41:41.968
Everything else on the list
in here?

41:42.002 --> 41:45.238
I picked up your tampons, and
that's what's in the other bag.

41:45.271 --> 41:46.439
Good.

41:46.473 --> 41:48.108
Could I take the hat off
for, like, one second?

41:48.108 --> 41:49.476
Yeah.

41:49.509 --> 41:52.345
Oh, God, I'm not--
I'm a real person.

41:52.379 --> 41:53.480
Ohh.

41:53.513 --> 41:55.115
How did it feel
to be me for a day?

41:55.148 --> 41:56.449
Is this what you feel like?

41:56.483 --> 41:58.151
You feel trapped
in a bunny suit?

41:58.184 --> 41:59.152
I used to.

41:59.185 --> 42:00.787
What?

42:00.820 --> 42:02.055
That's so weird.

42:03.056 --> 42:04.057
You did well.

42:04.057 --> 42:06.292
This has been
humiliating enough for you.

42:06.326 --> 42:09.262
Now having hopped a mile
in Olivia's shoes,

42:09.295 --> 42:13.400
I perhaps have
a bit of a new perspective.

42:13.433 --> 42:15.969
[slurping]

42:18.371 --> 42:20.306
- Hey.
- Hold on one second. Yeah?

42:20.340 --> 42:22.442
You know, you did everything
I asked, your time's done.

42:22.475 --> 42:23.710
You don't have to wear
the bunny suit anymore.

42:23.743 --> 42:25.712
Okay, thanks.
Good to know.

42:25.745 --> 42:27.414
So you're wearing that
'cause you want to?

42:28.982 --> 42:30.316
- I'm fine. You need anything?
- Okay, just letting you know.

42:30.350 --> 42:32.719
You're done.
Okay.

42:32.752 --> 42:36.523
Sorry, my ex-assistant just--
driving me crazy.

42:36.556 --> 42:39.693
(Ryan voice-over)
That's all, folks.
