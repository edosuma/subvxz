00:09.010 --> 00:09.742
¶

00:09.744 --> 00:11.443
Okay.

00:11.445 --> 00:14.546
I'm swimming up stream
a bit here but...

00:14.548 --> 00:16.248
I really do love LA.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.649
I mean, it's okay.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.151
You don't like it here?

00:19.153 --> 00:21.320
No, I do, I like it,
it's just...

00:21.322 --> 00:22.521
there's too many people.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.189
The traffic, it's insane.

00:24.191 --> 00:26.325
The smog is out of control.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.494
Yeah, but we have nice beaches.

00:28.496 --> 00:31.430
People are pretty mellow
so I'd give it like a 50/50.

00:31.432 --> 00:34.033
-Ey, I'll take 50/50.
-Good.

00:34.035 --> 00:35.100
At least you don't hate it.

00:35.102 --> 00:37.336
Yeah, yeah.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.137
Want some?

00:38.139 --> 00:39.238
No, I'm good.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.439
Okay, you're good.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.307
Let's get some pie!

00:42.309 --> 00:44.710
No, I'm too high to be
in public right now.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.412
I can't, I can't do it.

00:46.414 --> 00:48.213
Why didn't you stop us
from getting so high?

00:48.215 --> 00:49.481
I don't know.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.583
-Yeah, I'm really high too.
-I know.

00:51.585 --> 00:55.120
-This is your fault.
-I'm sorry.

00:55.122 --> 00:56.221
Ugh.

00:56.223 --> 00:58.824
Yeah, I'm high.

00:58.826 --> 01:00.526
Damn.

01:00.528 --> 01:02.194
What are we gonna do?

01:02.196 --> 01:05.164
We're gonna make pie.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.465
-We're gonna make pie?
-Yeah.

01:06.467 --> 01:07.499
-Like you and me?
-Yeah.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.468
-Together?
-Yeah, yeah.

01:09.470 --> 01:12.538
-Yeah, you and me, uh-huh.
-No, we are?

01:12.540 --> 01:14.106
All right.

01:14.108 --> 01:16.175
I'll just take your word for it.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.776
Get it excited for it.
Right now.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.144
-Can you drive?
-I'm good.

01:19.146 --> 01:20.446
I'm good, I'm good.

01:20.448 --> 01:21.447
You can't get pie
but you can drive?

01:21.449 --> 01:23.482
-Right, right.
-Okay.

01:23.484 --> 01:31.690
¶

01:35.229 --> 01:37.729
We're not gonna miss these.

01:37.731 --> 01:42.701
Okay and then for the pie crust.

01:42.703 --> 01:44.303
I don't know, just add water.

01:44.305 --> 01:47.239
¶

01:47.241 --> 01:50.576
Stocks are down.

01:50.578 --> 01:53.112
Which ones?

01:53.114 --> 01:55.747
Uh, the red ones.

01:55.749 --> 02:05.524
¶

02:17.338 --> 02:19.905
Seriously? You still watch
Mel Gibson movies?

02:19.907 --> 02:21.507
Oh, absolutely.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.175
But the whole Jewish thing!

02:23.177 --> 02:25.844
What? I mean, it's art.
It's art.

02:25.846 --> 02:28.514
You wouldn't stop watching
Disney movies, would you?

02:28.516 --> 02:30.249
Mmm, well turns out
he's not quite the bigot

02:30.251 --> 02:31.783
everyone thought he was.

02:31.785 --> 02:34.453
Well, there's gotta be a better
example out there anyway.

02:34.455 --> 02:36.388
-No, no.
-No.

02:36.390 --> 02:39.691
¶

02:39.693 --> 02:41.593
And you know,
I've always thought

02:41.595 --> 02:43.495
that if Mel Gibson and I like
just got to know each other

02:43.497 --> 02:44.863
a little bit,
could turn him around

02:44.865 --> 02:47.399
on the whole Jewish thing.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.800
Right.

02:48.802 --> 02:54.306
¶

02:54.308 --> 02:55.807
Coming in hot.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.776
There you go and one for me.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.811
So ready.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.713
Me too.

03:01.715 --> 03:04.583
-Ugh, okay, yes.
-Here we go.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.858
-Oh.
-This is so bad.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.593
So bad.

03:14.595 --> 03:17.262
It's like really bad.

03:17.264 --> 03:20.465
Don't gag.

03:20.467 --> 03:21.833
No--I'm serious.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.769
Don't you--

03:23.771 --> 03:24.870
Oh my god.

03:24.872 --> 03:29.308
No, no, wait it gets better.

03:29.310 --> 03:33.278
It just tastes
way too authentic.

03:33.280 --> 03:36.215
It tastes kind of sweaty.

03:36.217 --> 03:40.752
It tastes like the inside
of my dogs mouth.

03:40.754 --> 03:43.555
It tastes like when
grandma wants you to stay

03:43.557 --> 03:47.793
but you make up an excuse
but leave anyway.

03:47.795 --> 03:50.929
It tastes like the bottom
of Gandhi's feet.

03:50.931 --> 03:54.766
Yeah it does.

03:54.768 --> 03:58.804
Are you still eating it?

03:58.806 --> 04:01.340
No, no, no.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.408
In cash, yeah.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.244
How long is that going to take?

04:05.246 --> 04:10.315
Okay, all right, thank you,
thank you, bye.

04:10.317 --> 04:13.285
Okay, it's going to be
about an hour.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.487
Well, what do you want to do?

04:15.489 --> 04:19.825
¶

04:19.827 --> 04:22.261
-So addicting.
-Is it?

04:22.263 --> 04:24.529
-This is all I ever need.
-It's over.

04:24.531 --> 04:27.266
I won't move after this day.

04:27.268 --> 04:28.700
¶

04:28.702 --> 04:32.371
(knocking)

04:32.373 --> 04:41.880
¶

04:47.888 --> 04:49.955
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.457
-Mmm, it's good.
-Mhm, it is.

04:52.459 --> 04:55.594
-It's like really fucking good.
-It's so good.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.763
Well, you are really high
though.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.331
I'm really high.

04:59.333 --> 05:03.969
(chuckling)

05:03.971 --> 05:07.939
So why do you like pie so much?

05:07.941 --> 05:10.575
Hm.

05:10.577 --> 05:11.610
¶

05:11.612 --> 05:13.945
Who doesn't like pie.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.814
I wouldn't trust someone
who doesn't like pie

05:15.816 --> 05:17.516
or dogs.

05:17.518 --> 05:20.552
You always do pie
on the first date?

05:20.554 --> 05:22.521
Hm, I try to, you know.

05:22.523 --> 05:23.922
Why?

05:23.924 --> 05:26.725
¶

05:26.727 --> 05:28.794
It's easy.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.829
It's cheap.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.664
Sometimes--
and this has happened,

05:32.666 --> 05:35.434
sometimes there's no spark,
sometimes it's just not there.

05:35.436 --> 05:39.071
Sometimes I don't like her,
she doesn't like me.

05:39.073 --> 05:42.040
I'm a little anxious,
she's a little boring.

05:42.042 --> 05:46.545
Okay, what's the worst date
you've ever been on?

05:46.547 --> 05:50.048
Let's not call it the worst date
or the best worst date.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.751
-Maybe just the weirdest date.
-Okay?

05:52.753 --> 05:54.920
Cause in the end
I kind of have a good time.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.488
Right, right, right, okay.

05:56.490 --> 05:59.124
-Tell me more.
-Okay, all right.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.926
I think it was like
two years ago.

06:00.928 --> 06:04.529
We're meeting at Dupar's,
I mean, we were getting pie.

06:04.531 --> 06:09.000
Wait, were you wearing
your date-night-shirt?

06:09.002 --> 06:11.570
-This shirt?
-Yeah.

06:11.572 --> 06:15.407
-No.
-Mhm.

06:15.409 --> 06:17.509
-Met her on Tinder.
-Naturally.

06:17.511 --> 06:20.011
And in all of her pictures
she's wearing

06:20.013 --> 06:22.381
very cute,
like pixie-type things.

06:22.383 --> 06:23.815
-Does that make sense?
-Yeah, yeah.

06:23.817 --> 06:25.484
But I was into it,
I was into it.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.686
So wait, what was she wearing
when she rolled up though?

06:27.688 --> 06:30.155
Oh like head-to-toe goth.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.124
Nothing but.

06:32.126 --> 06:33.492
I mean, black dress,

06:33.494 --> 06:35.127
black lipstick,

06:35.129 --> 06:36.762
black veil over her eyes.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.897
-The whole thing.
-Oh my gosh.

06:38.899 --> 06:42.701
And--and I'm not--I'm probably
exaggerating to an extent

06:42.703 --> 06:45.003
but I remember her
just being a foot taller.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.938
Just like looking down at me.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.707
-Wait what did you do?
-What do you mean,

06:48.709 --> 06:50.175
-what did I do?
-Well, did you leave?

06:50.177 --> 06:52.811
-No, no way.
-What? What?

06:52.813 --> 06:54.780
No way, there's rules you know.

06:54.782 --> 06:57.449
You sign up for pie you get me.

06:57.451 --> 07:02.521
Or you sign up for me
and you get some pie.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.523
-One or the other.
-One or the other.

07:04.525 --> 07:07.492
And like I said, it ended up
being a pretty good time.

07:07.494 --> 07:11.863
I would've missed out
on meeting a perfectly decent,

07:11.865 --> 07:13.799
perfectly sweet person.

07:13.801 --> 07:19.905
¶

07:19.907 --> 07:21.807
Wow.

07:21.809 --> 07:24.943
-For real.
-That's sweet of you.

07:24.945 --> 07:28.713
-I have my moments.
-Rare.

07:28.715 --> 07:31.082
This pie is so fucking good.

07:31.084 --> 07:34.152
I'm gonna finish this whole
thing and jump off the roof.

07:34.154 --> 07:37.556
-Uh-oh.
-Oh your hair.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.891
You should wash it.

07:39.893 --> 07:42.894
Aw, lady trying
to save the tramp.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.864
Oh, well can't a lady try?

07:45.866 --> 07:47.199
She can.

07:47.201 --> 07:57.075
¶

09:01.542 --> 09:04.743
Sorry, I completely
lost my train of thought.

09:04.745 --> 09:07.312
What exactly did you want
to talk to me about today?

09:07.314 --> 09:09.948
Oh, oh, yeah, it's...

09:09.950 --> 09:13.084
so I've been taking
my dates out for pie.

09:13.086 --> 09:16.288
So you've been dating, good.

09:16.290 --> 09:20.125
How have you felt different
since you started dating?

09:20.127 --> 09:25.830
I feel like I've been having
these micro relationships.

09:25.832 --> 09:28.733
Why do you use the word micro?

09:28.735 --> 09:33.605
Because it's another word
for small.

09:33.607 --> 09:37.709
All right, it--it feels like
all simmer and no boil.

09:37.711 --> 09:40.779
Yeah sometimes these
things take time to develop.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.614
Yeah well, sometimes they don't.

09:42.616 --> 09:47.652
It's overstated but you
won't know until you try.

09:47.654 --> 09:50.889
-It is overstated.
-Look,

09:50.891 --> 09:53.725
everyone comes into our lives
for a season,

09:53.727 --> 09:56.695
a reason and forever.

09:56.697 --> 09:59.898
Don't worry about the ones
who will be there forever.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.601
Just enjoy the ones
for a season and...

10:02.603 --> 10:05.103
remember the ones for a reason.

10:05.105 --> 10:08.173
Do you understand
what that means?

10:08.175 --> 10:12.277
It means that no one
knows anything.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.145
Look, this isn't a quiz.

10:14.147 --> 10:15.880
Just think about it.

10:15.882 --> 10:17.248
Take it home with ya.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.350
I can take it home with me.

10:18.352 --> 10:21.252
And remember...

10:21.254 --> 10:24.856
A season, a reason and forever.

10:24.858 --> 10:30.729
¶

10:30.731 --> 10:32.697
(laughing)

10:32.699 --> 10:34.833
Oh yeah, I love this movie!

10:34.835 --> 10:38.403
My great Uncle Chester
was just violently murdered.

10:38.405 --> 10:41.006
¶

10:41.008 --> 10:43.241
(laughing)

10:43.243 --> 10:46.277
¶

10:46.279 --> 10:47.278
(shouting)

10:47.280 --> 10:50.749
(slashing)

10:53.687 --> 10:58.023
(laughing)

10:58.025 --> 10:59.791
So she tells me to like trim up

10:59.793 --> 11:01.860
and I'm thinking to myself,
well all right, fine.

11:01.862 --> 11:04.362
What I'll do--and tell me
what your thoughts are here

11:04.364 --> 11:06.097
cause I'm really curious,
I was thinking about doing

11:06.099 --> 11:08.333
a giant fade and then
I was thinking at the bottom

11:08.335 --> 11:10.769
I'd take some Nair and--Dude,
where are you going?

11:10.771 --> 11:12.337
I have a date actually.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.272
Dude, it was The Empire
Strikes Back night.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.107
Every night's
Empire Strikes Back.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.143
Dude, I got your favorite
popcorn from Trader Joe's.

11:18.145 --> 11:20.011
Like, I thought this was
like planned.

11:20.013 --> 11:24.916
I appreciate it, I have
a date with Jackie Collins.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.418
Like, the Jackie Collins?

11:26.420 --> 11:27.886
The Jackie Collins
from high school.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.421
How the fuck did
you pull that off, dude?

11:29.423 --> 11:31.056
We matched on Bumble.

11:31.058 --> 11:34.092
Barry, Barry, Barry.

11:34.094 --> 11:37.862
Barry, Barry, Barry.

11:37.864 --> 11:40.799
Barry, Barry, Barry.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.934
-Barry--
-This is the best part, man.

11:42.936 --> 11:45.136
(shouting)

11:45.138 --> 11:47.839
Shut the fuck up.

11:47.841 --> 11:50.141
Dude, why are you wearing
that shirt?

11:50.143 --> 11:51.776
Why, what's wrong
with this shirt?

11:51.778 --> 11:53.344
I've known you for 16 years,

11:53.346 --> 11:54.979
I think I met you in that shirt.

11:54.981 --> 11:56.247
You cannot be wearing that shirt

11:56.249 --> 11:57.449
on a date with Jackie Collins.

11:57.451 --> 11:58.450
No, it's--I love this shirt.

11:58.452 --> 12:00.985
It's like blue and red.

12:00.987 --> 12:02.854
Are you taking her
to the batting cages?

12:02.856 --> 12:04.322
Cause that's what
it looks like.

12:04.323 --> 12:05.789
You're taking her
to the fucking batting cages.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.992
No, I'm not taking her
to the batting cages.

12:07.994 --> 12:09.961
That shirt sucks your presence
right out of the room

12:09.963 --> 12:11.429
and you need to change
that shirt right now.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.264
This is a good shirt--
Just don't get in my head.

12:13.266 --> 12:14.899
-This is a good shirt.
-You're embarrassing yourself.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.134
No I'm not,
this is a great shirt.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.902
Are you trying to get laid?

12:17.904 --> 12:20.238
Of course, well, maybe,
this is the first date.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.873
-No.
-It's a great shirt.

12:21.875 --> 12:22.907
Go back in your room,
change your shirt.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.275
I will loan you a goddamn shirt.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.910
-I'm not changing the shirt.
-That shirt,

12:25.912 --> 12:27.779
I'm sorry, it's awful.
It's fucking awful.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.414
It's not awful,
it is a quality--

12:29.416 --> 12:31.483
Dude, this is gonna be
the demise of you!

12:31.485 --> 12:33.284
You need to do this for me!

12:33.286 --> 12:36.521
You are not taking that
fucking shirt out with you!

12:36.523 --> 12:38.056
You're not wearing that shirt.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.824
Go back in your room,
change your shirt.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.493
I will loan you a shirt,
that shirt's awful.

12:41.495 --> 12:43.795
-I'm not changing the shirt.
-You're fucking this up for us.

12:43.797 --> 12:45.463
The shirt's fine, I'm fine,
you're fucking with my head.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.198
-This is awful!
-I'm not changing the shirt.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.334
Why? Are you trying to get laid?

12:49.336 --> 12:50.869
You're fucking this up.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.237
You're fucking this up
for both of us.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.806
Once again, once again.

12:54.808 --> 13:04.482
¶

14:32.639 --> 14:35.640
Can I tell you something
you don't know?

14:35.642 --> 14:37.108
Sure.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.043
What don't I know?

14:39.045 --> 14:43.381
I had a huge crush on you
in high school.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.316
What?

14:45.318 --> 14:47.085
You look like you're having
a stroke right now.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.420
I am having a stroke right now.

14:49.422 --> 14:52.090
You had a crush on me
in high school?

14:52.092 --> 14:55.226
-No, you're fucking with me.
-No.

14:55.228 --> 14:59.631
-I don't believe you.
-You should.

14:59.633 --> 15:04.936
But I think I'm Asexual.

15:04.938 --> 15:07.038
You can reproduce by yourself?

15:07.040 --> 15:08.640
What?

15:08.642 --> 15:10.308
No, is that what you think
it means?

15:10.310 --> 15:12.477
That is what that means.

15:12.479 --> 15:13.511
No, not at all.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.446
I'm--I'm pretty sure.

15:15.448 --> 15:19.017
Hammerhead sharks,
banana slugs and Godzilla

15:19.019 --> 15:20.585
can reproduce by themselves.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.354
-That is not what Asexual means.
-Hell yeah.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.456
Alright, 80 percent sure.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.358
You remember the movie
in the '90s, Godzilla

15:27.360 --> 15:28.927
just laid eggs all by itself.

15:28.929 --> 15:31.629
-No, it means--
-Yup, 100 percent.

15:31.631 --> 15:34.499
-That is not what it means.
-Are you sure?

15:34.501 --> 15:37.235
It means I don't have
sexual feelings.

15:37.237 --> 15:38.970
What?

15:38.972 --> 15:41.572
Yeah, I just don't enjoy sex.

15:41.574 --> 15:45.009
-You don't enjoy sex at all?
-Yeah.

15:45.011 --> 15:47.512
I mean, I've always known
I was different but...

15:47.514 --> 15:50.214
-I've never had an orgasm.
-Uh-huh.

15:50.216 --> 15:52.350
Every guy says,
"I'll give you an orgasm"

15:52.352 --> 15:54.652
-and he never does.
-Right but what happens

15:54.654 --> 15:58.423
-when you're having sex?
-Oh, I let them do their thing.

15:58.425 --> 16:03.227
You just let them
do their thing?

16:03.229 --> 16:04.662
Ugh.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.297
It's completely consensual.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.633
No, not that part,
the other part.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.601
I guess I'm just imagining
if it were me

16:10.603 --> 16:13.237
and someone else telling me
that everything I'm doing

16:13.239 --> 16:17.075
when I'm having sex is not,
like they're not enjoying any

16:17.077 --> 16:20.244
part of it, that horrifies me.

16:20.246 --> 16:23.081
On a really deep level.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.615
I mean, I'm sorry, that sucks.

16:24.617 --> 16:27.352
I'm sorry that you don't
enjoy sex but like fuck,

16:27.354 --> 16:32.123
oh my god, like I can see it.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.725
Sex is awesome.

16:33.727 --> 16:37.095
I mean, I love having sex.

16:37.097 --> 16:40.665
You really don't enjoy
having sex?

16:40.667 --> 16:43.634
Like ever, ugh.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.438
Oh my god, we're making out.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.174
We are making out.

16:50.176 --> 16:51.609
Are you sure?

16:51.611 --> 16:53.444
Yeah, why not?

16:53.446 --> 16:55.580
The whole Asexual thing.

16:55.582 --> 16:59.017
Come on, I said I think
I might be Asexual.

16:59.019 --> 17:02.353
There's only one way
to find out.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.721
If you say so.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.557
(grunting)

17:09.029 --> 17:12.330
(video game chattering)

17:15.235 --> 17:17.368
Yeah! Who's your sensei, bitch!

17:17.370 --> 17:19.270
Nope, it's bow to your sensei.

17:19.272 --> 17:20.772
Whatever, dude.

17:20.774 --> 17:22.473
You always play
with fucking Kirby, dude.

17:22.475 --> 17:25.176
-Such a bullshit character.
-Such a hack.

17:25.178 --> 17:28.413
Ugh, hate the player, boys,
hate the player.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.048
Yeah, whatever
that fucking means.

17:30.050 --> 17:32.183
Oh! Did you see
that Falcon punch?

17:32.185 --> 17:33.584
Ugh, fucker.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.353
Oh, you like that?

17:35.355 --> 17:37.188
Oh, Falcon punch!

17:37.190 --> 17:38.723
Get ready to get fucked!

17:38.725 --> 17:42.126
You guys have serious
fucking shit to work through.

17:42.128 --> 17:44.062
Well, eventually
he'll put pants back on.

17:44.064 --> 17:46.264
Yeah, after I'm done fucking
eating ass right now.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.799
-Fucker.
-Yeah, that's exactly what

17:47.801 --> 17:49.367
I'm talking about,
you guys spend way too much

17:49.369 --> 17:52.770
-fucking time together.
-Dammit!

17:52.772 --> 17:56.307
Ugh, ugh.

17:56.309 --> 17:59.110
Oh, dude, aren't you going out
with what's-her-face?

17:59.112 --> 18:00.311
Yup, I'm going out with
what's-her-face.

18:00.313 --> 18:01.679
Nice, nice.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.214
Are you gonna
put it in this time?

18:03.215 --> 18:04.748
Or are you gonna bite the bullet
and jerk off as usual?

18:04.751 --> 18:07.185
Well, I always bite the bullet
and jerk off

18:07.187 --> 18:12.557
but last time we did some stuff.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.392
So did ya put it in?

18:14.394 --> 18:16.294
Dude, why are you so interested?

18:16.296 --> 18:19.697
I don't know, I mean, trust me,
when he doesn't let laid

18:19.699 --> 18:23.234
we all suffer.

18:23.236 --> 18:26.104
Fuck yeah!

18:26.106 --> 18:29.307
-Yeah, motherfucker.
-Quit plaguing me, dog.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.542
-Ugh.
-Oh, aw damn, come on.

18:31.544 --> 18:35.313
Oh yeah, fuck yeah.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.481
Oh yes!

18:36.483 --> 18:38.316
Suck it bitch! Who's your daddy?

18:38.318 --> 18:40.718
Up top! Yeah, fuck you.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.587
You play with Kirby
and you do the whole like--

18:42.589 --> 18:44.589
if it ever gets down
to one life left

18:44.591 --> 18:48.159
you swallow me, drag me
to the bottom and win.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.327
Fucking hack character.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.362
Such a hack character.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.164
I mean, this has been fun.
It's been great.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.665
Whoa dude, hang on,
we're having a tourney here.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.501
This wasn't a tourney this was--

18:56.503 --> 18:57.835
Dude, we've only been playing
for like four hours.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.787
We're like not even
halfway there.

18:59.788 --> 19:01.738
Why does it always have
to be a tourney with you?

19:01.741 --> 19:03.708
And if this isn't a tournament
what is a tournament?

19:03.710 --> 19:06.677
We need to get to
the hand level.

19:06.679 --> 19:07.912
-The hand level.
-Are you guys like really...

19:07.914 --> 19:09.847
Okay, fine but seriously though.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.183
Like, we're not even like at
like the Donkey Kong level,

19:12.185 --> 19:13.818
dude and you're already
giving up?

19:13.820 --> 19:15.753
I mean, yeah, I'm good
but am I that good?

19:15.755 --> 19:16.721
No.

19:16.723 --> 19:17.788
Accept the challenge.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.190
You won, take the win.

19:19.192 --> 19:20.458
I am taking the win.

19:20.460 --> 19:21.759
But you didn't accept
the challenge.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.294
I mean, I love this,
I love this.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.429
-This was exhausting.
-This was, yeah,

19:25.431 --> 19:28.399
it was exhausting,
I have a date.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.368
Taking her out for pie again,
aren't ya?

19:30.370 --> 19:34.672
As a matter of fact,
I am not taking her to pie but--

19:34.674 --> 19:37.375
-Good, thank god.
-What's wrong with pie?

19:37.377 --> 19:38.810
Everything's wrong with pie,
dude.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.244
-Nothing is wrong with pie.
-You're a grown ass man.

19:40.246 --> 19:42.280
How many times
do I have to explain this?

19:42.282 --> 19:43.748
The pie works.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.950
-The pie works, Garrett.
-Pie is like,

19:45.952 --> 19:49.453
"Oh, I'm gonna go take my
grandmother to Cocos for pie."

19:49.455 --> 19:51.656
No, no, no, no this is
Jackie fucking Collins.

19:51.658 --> 19:53.291
At least fake
like you have money.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.926
-Do something.
-Not everyone can be like you

19:54.928 --> 19:58.229
going around picking up chicks
like a big, sweaty, hairy

19:58.231 --> 20:00.698
-Pepé Le Pew.
-I'm just saying that you--

20:00.700 --> 20:03.201
you need to grow up--
you need to grow up.

20:03.203 --> 20:05.303
-What? Like a bar?
-Exactly.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.771
You need to take her out
to a bar.

20:06.773 --> 20:09.373
-Everyone enjoys pie.
-Who doesn't like pie?

20:09.375 --> 20:11.375
-Pies work for him.
-Okay, in the past

20:11.377 --> 20:13.644
but not with Jackie Collins,
cause this--

20:13.646 --> 20:15.746
Jackie Collins
is not like any other girl, man

20:15.748 --> 20:19.217
and you need to respect her
like that, okay.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.618
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

20:20.620 --> 20:26.524
¶

20:26.526 --> 20:28.559
Uh, hoo-hoo.

20:28.561 --> 20:29.894
How ya doing, champ?

20:29.896 --> 20:31.229
Very funny.

20:31.231 --> 20:34.565
It's uh, quite hoppy.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.368
I love this bar
though it's um...

20:37.370 --> 20:38.970
-it's very festive.
-Yeah.

20:38.972 --> 20:41.372
-Yeah.
-It's fun.

20:41.374 --> 20:43.641
My friends and I used
to come here a lot.

20:43.643 --> 20:46.577
Oh wow, thirsty?

20:46.579 --> 20:50.348
Uh, just a tad.

20:50.350 --> 20:53.317
-So how's your parents?
-Oh they're good.

20:53.319 --> 20:56.587
Both semi-retired and living
their best lives of course.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.389
As they should.

20:58.391 --> 21:01.926
They're always asking
if I'd like to move back home.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.962
Nah, I could not live at home.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.897
All my friends have
like managed to not--

21:06.899 --> 21:09.367
they don't live at home
but they like slowly moved

21:09.369 --> 21:12.436
closer to the neighborhoods
we all grew up in.

21:12.438 --> 21:13.604
-You know?
-Yeah.

21:13.606 --> 21:17.341
-Yeah.
-No.

21:17.343 --> 21:19.043
How's your fam doing?

21:19.045 --> 21:22.647
They're divorced
but it's--it's fine.

21:22.649 --> 21:25.816
It's--It's fine.

21:25.818 --> 21:30.354
They're--it's better
that they're, you know,

21:30.356 --> 21:34.325
they needed it but I don't know
what they're gonna do,

21:34.327 --> 21:37.395
I mean, when I one day
get married

21:37.397 --> 21:39.630
and they're forced to be
in the same room

21:39.632 --> 21:42.433
for an extended period
of time but.

21:42.435 --> 21:44.869
Yeah, that's actually all my
parents keep talking about now.

21:44.871 --> 21:47.605
-Yeah?
-When I'll get married.

21:47.607 --> 21:49.607
Yeah, mine have moved on
from the

21:49.609 --> 21:50.641
"When are you getting married"

21:50.643 --> 21:52.576
to the "Please get married"

21:52.578 --> 21:56.747
and eventually the "Don't
die alone" phase you know.

21:56.749 --> 22:00.384
Well, to divorced parent
problems, you know.

22:00.386 --> 22:01.752
Woo!

22:01.754 --> 22:05.890
Well, you can always marry me.

22:05.892 --> 22:07.058
Yeah.

22:07.060 --> 22:10.795
Why is that so funny?

22:10.797 --> 22:14.498
It's not.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.534
I would be so lucky.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.336
Yes, you would.

22:18.338 --> 22:22.973
¶

22:25.712 --> 22:28.979
-(indistinct mumbling)
-Shh, you'll wake up my aunt.

22:28.981 --> 22:30.848
-So this is home.
-Turn the light off!

22:30.850 --> 22:33.818
¶

22:37.090 --> 22:43.627
¶

22:43.629 --> 22:47.498
What's wrong with me, doctor?

22:47.500 --> 22:48.899
-What?
-Oh yeah.

22:48.901 --> 22:51.068
We're mid doing stuff, right?

22:51.070 --> 22:54.839
And she stops and says
"What's wrong with me, doctor?"

22:54.841 --> 22:56.540
What did you say?

22:56.542 --> 22:57.942
¶

22:57.944 --> 23:03.981
Nothing,
nothing's wrong with you.

23:03.983 --> 23:06.484
-Nothing? You said nothing?
-Yeah.

23:06.486 --> 23:08.753
-Why didn't you roleplay?
-I don't--I don't know.

23:08.755 --> 23:10.688
-What's wrong with you?
-I just ignored it.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.656
I don't know what to--
I don't roleplay.

23:12.658 --> 23:15.826
So you're telling me that you're
in bed with Jackie Collins

23:15.828 --> 23:18.062
about to roleplay
and you did nothing?

23:18.064 --> 23:20.398
We did under the pants stuff.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.867
So you did nothing
and you got nothing.

23:22.869 --> 23:25.603
This is literally
the worst day of my life.

23:25.605 --> 23:28.038
The worst day of our lives.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.541
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Are you kidding me?

23:30.543 --> 23:31.642
What would you have done?

23:31.644 --> 23:33.744
What would I have done?

23:33.746 --> 23:35.045
Oh let me tell you what--

23:35.047 --> 23:36.547
¶

23:36.549 --> 23:40.151
(moaning)

23:40.153 --> 23:43.554
Oh, we shouldn't be doing this.
It's so wrong.

23:43.556 --> 23:45.122
This is so wrong,
what if my husband finds out?

23:45.124 --> 23:46.590
He won't, babe.

23:46.592 --> 23:48.025
Fuck me, Dr. G!

23:48.027 --> 23:50.194
¶

23:54.200 --> 23:55.833
What's the point?

23:55.835 --> 23:57.485
Are we going to
hang these things by

23:57.486 --> 23:59.136
-highest grossing or not?
-On the contrary,

23:59.138 --> 24:02.907
we're going to go by
best reviewed by critics.

24:02.909 --> 24:05.476
Therefore, we're going to do
The Empire Strikes Back

24:05.478 --> 24:06.911
and then I think A New Hope

24:06.913 --> 24:09.013
and then lastly,
we'll do Return of the Jedi.

24:09.015 --> 24:16.787
¶

24:16.789 --> 24:19.123
(typing)

24:19.125 --> 24:20.991
Hey man, sorry I'm late.

24:20.993 --> 24:22.760
Hey buddy, it's all good.

24:22.762 --> 24:27.097
Next time just um--fuck it,
I don't...

24:27.099 --> 24:30.201
Oh hey, by the way--
ugh man, what are you wearing?

24:30.203 --> 24:32.002
Come on.

24:32.004 --> 24:34.672
You said a collared shirt.
This is a collared shirt.

24:34.674 --> 24:36.974
It's a collared shirt,
that's a stupid collared shirt.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.510
You look like a drug dealer man,
from the '80s

24:39.512 --> 24:42.213
in Miami who's 12.

24:42.215 --> 24:47.017
Well, that's exactly
what I'm going for.

24:47.019 --> 24:50.788
So you definitely have a virus.

24:50.790 --> 24:54.959
Uh, have you downloaded
anything unusual lately?

24:54.961 --> 24:57.027
What would be unusual?

24:57.029 --> 24:59.630
Something in Russian

24:59.632 --> 25:05.603
or Czechoslovakian?

25:05.605 --> 25:11.876
¶

25:11.878 --> 25:13.811
Hey man, gonna need you
to come in over the weekend

25:13.813 --> 25:16.981
-and reset everything.
-Do I have a choice?

25:16.983 --> 25:18.616
(chuckling)

25:18.618 --> 25:20.251
Nope.

25:20.253 --> 25:28.826
¶

25:28.828 --> 25:33.664
¶ If we had forever ¶

25:33.666 --> 25:38.536
¶ I hope we'd just get better,
better, better ¶

25:38.538 --> 25:43.574
¶ That's why it's such a shame,
yeah ¶

25:43.576 --> 25:48.546
¶ The ways we say
the same, same, same ¶

25:48.548 --> 25:51.148
¶ Same, same, same ¶

25:51.150 --> 25:53.317
¶ Next motel ¶

25:53.319 --> 25:56.720
¶ We'll give a try ¶

25:56.722 --> 26:00.991

26:00.993 --> 26:06.964
¶ Ring a bell they'll deny ¶

26:06.966 --> 26:09.233
¶ Lie ¶

26:09.235 --> 26:11.168

26:11.170 --> 26:18.776
¶ When the black
is all you see ¶

26:18.778 --> 26:27.351
¶ Then it falls on me ¶

26:27.353 --> 26:30.621
Fuck! God fucking dammit!

26:30.623 --> 26:32.056
Ugh!

26:32.058 --> 26:36.160
(phone ringing)

26:36.162 --> 26:37.828
-Hi Mom.
-Hi honey.

26:37.830 --> 26:40.631
-This is your mother.
-How are you?

26:40.633 --> 26:44.101
I'm good, you know,
I'm just peachy.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.202
What do you mean peachy?

26:45.204 --> 26:46.870
Like sunburned?

26:46.872 --> 26:49.974
No, not like sunburned peachy,
like--

26:49.976 --> 26:52.343
-how are you?
-I'm okay.

26:52.345 --> 26:56.914
I'm drinking a little new wine.

26:56.916 --> 26:59.083
It's called Rose-y.

26:59.085 --> 27:01.819
Ah, rosé everyday, am I right?

27:01.821 --> 27:04.088
-Have you tried it?
-Yeah, yeah, you know,

27:04.090 --> 27:06.824
-it's kind of fancy.
-It's good.

27:06.826 --> 27:11.128
I'm not sure I--I feel it
at all but...

27:11.130 --> 27:12.997
-How's work?
-Work is good.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.965
Just another day
of being underqualified

27:14.967 --> 27:17.901
and underpaid it's...

27:17.903 --> 27:20.638
You could always go back
to school, sweetheart.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.806
Or do porn.

27:22.808 --> 27:25.042
Sweetheart I love you

27:25.044 --> 27:27.711
but I have seen your penis.

27:27.713 --> 27:29.747
Okay, that's--that's...

27:29.749 --> 27:31.815
yeah, thanks Mom,
I just, I really--

27:31.817 --> 27:33.384
It's a wonderful penis.

27:33.386 --> 27:34.952
All I'm saying is--

27:34.954 --> 27:39.256
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom,
ya just--no, okay?

27:39.258 --> 27:42.693
-I gotta go.
-Really? Why?

27:42.695 --> 27:44.995
Because I have a date
and this isn't exactly the--

27:44.997 --> 27:47.865
you know,
pep talk I had in mind.

27:47.867 --> 27:51.702
Okay, okay, I get it.

27:51.704 --> 27:55.039
-I love you.
-I love you too, Mom.

27:55.041 --> 27:56.340
Oh and call your father.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.742
Make sure he's still alive.

27:58.744 --> 28:00.444
God knows who feeds that man.

28:00.446 --> 28:02.846
Uh, okay I will.

28:02.848 --> 28:04.114
Buh-bye.

28:04.116 --> 28:13.857
¶

28:31.043 --> 28:33.010
-That shirt is--
-That shirt.

28:33.012 --> 28:34.812
I mean, our colors
totally match.

28:34.814 --> 28:36.246
-They're great, it's great.
-It's amazing.

28:36.248 --> 28:39.483
They're kind of like
druggie shirts but I mean,

28:39.485 --> 28:42.720
if anything our shirt game
is on point.

28:42.722 --> 28:45.089
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

28:45.091 --> 28:48.892
-What's your zodiac sign?
-Mine? Uh, Taurus.

28:48.894 --> 28:52.262
Oh my god, literally
all of my friends are Tauruses.

28:52.264 --> 28:53.464
-Are they?
-Yeah.

28:53.466 --> 28:56.333
Hm, that's wow.

28:56.335 --> 28:58.202
Hello, my name is Bailey

28:58.204 --> 28:59.970
and I'm gonna be playing
you guys a song.

28:59.972 --> 29:05.008
Me? I am a Scorpio
with a rising sign of Aquarius.

29:05.010 --> 29:07.511
Well, technically,
the astrological signs

29:07.513 --> 29:11.348
have been shifting over
the last thousand years or so

29:11.350 --> 29:13.083
and like I was a Taurus right?

29:13.085 --> 29:15.853
According to science
I'm actually an Aries.

29:15.855 --> 29:18.188
So what--uh sorry, what'd
you say what was yours again?

29:18.190 --> 29:20.290
-A Scorpio.
-Right, so by the time

29:20.292 --> 29:22.760
you were born
it was actually a Libra.

29:22.762 --> 29:25.229
It's funny,
like I read Aries again

29:25.231 --> 29:27.030
and after I read it enough
it just sounded

29:27.032 --> 29:30.367
exactly the same to Taurus.

29:30.369 --> 29:32.269
And you know how it said
you're sensual?

29:32.271 --> 29:36.406
They never explicitly say
who's not sensual, you know.

29:36.408 --> 29:41.111
Well, you know Aries actually
tend to be hyper athletic,

29:41.113 --> 29:46.483
so you know,
don't worry about it.

29:46.485 --> 29:49.319
I don't even like pie.

29:49.321 --> 29:53.357
¶... For small town kids ¶

30:18.317 --> 30:21.985
¶ And we'll drink muddy water ¶

31:53.045 --> 32:00.484
¶ No longer ¶

32:17.569 --> 32:20.971
(clapping)

32:20.973 --> 32:24.207
Thank you.

32:28.280 --> 32:38.255
¶

32:45.130 --> 32:49.399
Oh, hey, it's you.

32:49.401 --> 32:51.034
No pie today?

32:51.036 --> 32:54.071
No, my pie had other plans.

32:54.073 --> 32:58.041
¶

32:58.043 --> 33:00.610
You played well tonight.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.746
You play well
every night though.

33:02.748 --> 33:04.581
Right, you're there a lot.

33:04.583 --> 33:06.984
Yeah, so are you.

33:06.986 --> 33:08.585
I am, every Thursday.

33:08.587 --> 33:14.558
Every Thursday.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.026
-What can I get you?
-A pilsner.

33:16.028 --> 33:17.527
You got it.

33:17.529 --> 33:20.130
So seriously, why pie?

33:20.132 --> 33:23.400
It's fucking cheap

33:23.402 --> 33:28.071
and it tastes good.

33:28.073 --> 33:30.007
Thanks, I'm gonna leave it open.

33:30.009 --> 33:32.042
Who doesn't like pie?

33:32.044 --> 33:36.179
¶

33:36.181 --> 33:38.315
What happened to that one?

33:38.317 --> 33:41.251
It's a quiche.

33:41.253 --> 33:44.388
You uh, you work for quiche?

33:44.390 --> 33:46.256
Not only quiche.

33:46.258 --> 33:48.692
They feel bad
that they pay us so little so

33:48.694 --> 33:51.495
they make it up in pie.

33:51.497 --> 33:54.264
And you chose quiche?

33:54.266 --> 33:56.700
-It doubles as breakfast.
-Hm.

33:56.702 --> 34:00.237
¶

34:00.239 --> 34:04.074
So seriously,
why do I always see you there?

34:04.076 --> 34:07.611
For the music.

34:07.613 --> 34:08.612
Another round?

34:08.614 --> 34:16.186
Yes but really dirty this time.

34:16.188 --> 34:23.126
Like really dirty.

34:23.128 --> 34:26.763
-Like filthy.
-I got it.

34:26.765 --> 34:30.567
Slap me in the face first
kind of filth.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.169
I got it.

34:32.171 --> 34:41.812
¶

34:47.453 --> 34:52.122
I uh, I never got your name.

34:52.124 --> 34:53.623
Bailey.

34:53.625 --> 34:55.592
Some people call me Bay.

34:55.594 --> 35:00.097
Do you uh, play pool, Bailey?

35:00.099 --> 35:02.566
Do you know how to play pool?

35:02.568 --> 35:05.402
Does it matter?

35:05.404 --> 35:08.605
Okay, so nothing's
gonna happen here

35:08.607 --> 35:10.774
between you and me.

35:10.776 --> 35:14.344
Right, I get it, you're gay.

35:14.346 --> 35:19.616
Yeah, I actually am gay.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.618
Dope.

35:21.620 --> 35:26.389
¶

35:26.391 --> 35:28.859
Pool?

35:28.861 --> 35:31.528
¶

35:31.530 --> 35:37.667
-So music is neat.
-It sure is.

35:37.669 --> 35:41.771
-Is that why you're out here?
-It's why I stayed.

35:41.773 --> 35:43.240
Do tell.

35:43.242 --> 35:48.512
¶

35:48.514 --> 35:53.750
Classic story of another girl
chasing another girl to LA.

35:53.752 --> 35:56.653
Tried and true tale.

35:56.655 --> 36:00.390
So where's this young woman now?

36:00.392 --> 36:02.659
She moved back to Chicago.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.394
Oh yeah?
Is that where you're from?

36:04.396 --> 36:05.529
Sure is.

36:05.531 --> 36:10.901
Good ol' Chicago.

36:10.903 --> 36:14.771
So why'd you stay out here?

36:14.773 --> 36:21.411
Well...

36:21.413 --> 36:23.246
I've been playing music
my whole life

36:23.248 --> 36:25.382
and when she left me for a guy

36:25.384 --> 36:27.284
who worked at the bar
she worked at

36:27.286 --> 36:31.321
I started writing
super depressing songs about it.

36:31.323 --> 36:32.455
Ah, man.

36:32.457 --> 36:35.525
So she was gay and is not--

36:35.527 --> 36:37.460
I don't think
she ever really was gay.

36:37.462 --> 36:39.663
¶

36:39.665 --> 36:41.865
I think it really is just
a phase for some people.

36:41.867 --> 36:51.541
¶

36:58.850 --> 37:01.718
About a year later I found out
that she got pregnant

37:01.720 --> 37:03.987
and moved back.

37:03.989 --> 37:06.890
Had to find out through
a mutual friend of ours.

37:06.892 --> 37:11.428
-Uck.
-She probably did me a favor.

37:11.430 --> 37:13.396
What favor was that?

37:13.398 --> 37:16.499
¶

37:16.501 --> 37:19.569
Well...

37:19.571 --> 37:21.504
Had I not chased her
all the way out here

37:21.506 --> 37:23.707
I wouldn't be working
day in and day out

37:23.709 --> 37:25.675
at a music career
to justify it all.

37:25.677 --> 37:35.619
¶

37:42.794 --> 37:48.865
You got any plans
after this epic game of pool?

37:48.867 --> 37:51.768
Uh, no, normally I'm better

37:51.770 --> 37:52.936
but to answer your question, no.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.704
Oh, normally you're better?

37:54.706 --> 37:56.673
Oh wow.

37:56.675 --> 38:00.610
Normally I'm much worse,
so there you go.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.412
Evens out.

38:02.414 --> 38:05.482
¶

38:05.484 --> 38:07.350
Want to smoke some weed?

38:07.352 --> 38:08.852
Not here.

38:08.854 --> 38:11.788
¶

38:11.790 --> 38:14.391
(sighing)

38:14.393 --> 38:18.395
Okay, so keeping in mind
that I find you unattractive.

38:18.397 --> 38:20.830
-Totally.
-And all penis is super gross.

38:20.832 --> 38:22.966
-So gross.
-Do you want to come back

38:22.968 --> 38:25.835
to my place, smoke some weed
and listen to music

38:25.837 --> 38:27.904
the way it's meant to be
listened to?

38:27.906 --> 38:30.974
In women's clothing?

38:30.976 --> 38:33.376
What?

38:33.378 --> 38:34.377
No.

38:34.379 --> 38:35.378
No.

38:35.380 --> 38:37.414
-Uh.
-No.

38:37.416 --> 38:40.350
-On vinyl.
-On vinyl.

38:40.352 --> 38:42.686
-Are you gay?
-I'm not gay.

38:42.688 --> 38:46.656
-That was kind of gay.
-Isn't everyone a little gay?

38:46.658 --> 38:49.392
You know, never mind sorry, no.

38:49.394 --> 38:50.960
I'd love to...

38:50.962 --> 38:53.463
-do what you just said.
-Cool.

38:53.465 --> 38:54.964
Let's get out of here.

38:54.966 --> 39:04.941
¶

39:18.090 --> 39:19.823
Ah.

39:19.825 --> 39:22.792
It's so big.

39:22.794 --> 39:24.494
What?

39:24.496 --> 39:26.396
Look at all this stuff.

39:26.398 --> 39:30.467
Did I say you could
touch anything?

39:30.469 --> 39:31.901
Just kidding.

39:31.903 --> 39:33.636
Kind of.

39:33.638 --> 39:34.971
Be careful.

39:34.973 --> 39:37.974
Yes, ma'am.

39:37.976 --> 39:40.643
What do you think?

39:40.645 --> 39:44.881
Good, it's like uh,
breakfast at midnight right?

39:48.153 --> 39:50.520
What?

39:50.522 --> 39:52.889
You think I haven't had
quiche before?

39:52.891 --> 39:54.991
I've had quiche.

39:54.993 --> 39:56.993
I'm cultured.

39:56.995 --> 40:00.530
Look at you,
living up to the hipster name.

40:00.532 --> 40:02.899
Shall we?

40:02.901 --> 40:08.071
¶...And run away ¶

40:08.073 --> 40:09.606
¶ I know you're going to...¶

40:09.608 --> 40:11.107
I know a little French.

40:11.109 --> 40:13.877
Oh?

40:13.879 --> 40:17.414
<i> Je suis un espion.</i>

40:17.416 --> 40:19.516
You're a spy?

40:19.518 --> 40:22.652
Is that what that means?

40:22.654 --> 40:27.457
-So what do you do?
-Well, a few different things.

40:27.459 --> 40:31.161
Uh, I'm an IT guy.

40:31.163 --> 40:38.468
¶...All I'm asking you now
is to walk away from my life ¶

40:38.470 --> 40:41.204
You like it?

40:41.206 --> 40:46.609
I don't love it but, I mean...

40:46.611 --> 40:48.211
¶ I bet you got it wrong ¶

40:48.213 --> 40:51.714
¶ The moment you
laid your eyes on me ¶

40:51.716 --> 40:53.149
...I don't sit around
thinking about

40:53.151 --> 40:55.919
when is the day going to end
or you know,

40:55.921 --> 40:58.488
you know,
staring out the window

40:58.490 --> 41:00.490
wishing I would die.

41:00.492 --> 41:02.659
There's worse things in life.

41:02.661 --> 41:06.029
What about you?

41:06.031 --> 41:10.733
Well, between all my little
shows and singing lessons

41:10.735 --> 41:17.040
and some bartending
I barely scrape by.

41:17.042 --> 41:19.876
Yeah but you love it.

41:19.878 --> 41:22.846
Yeah, sometimes I do.

41:22.848 --> 41:28.751
Uh, sometimes I wonder why
I'm doing it.

41:28.753 --> 41:30.720
I mean, I'm not waiting
for the day to end

41:30.722 --> 41:34.891
but I just...

41:34.893 --> 41:38.127
between all my little projects
and...

41:38.129 --> 41:40.864
the progress I think I'm making

41:40.866 --> 41:47.837
and work I find it's all
just blending together

41:47.839 --> 41:55.011
and watching my life in a blur
pass through a bus window.

41:55.013 --> 41:57.514
Now that was some hashtag art.

41:57.516 --> 42:00.116
Loneliness breeds inspiration.

42:00.118 --> 42:02.652
That's what I tell everybody.

42:02.654 --> 42:05.221
-I look like my mother.
-Nice.

42:05.223 --> 42:07.657
¶ I bet you got it wrong
the moment ¶

42:07.659 --> 42:12.262
¶ You laid your eyes on me ¶

42:12.264 --> 42:13.963
I look like my mother.

42:13.965 --> 42:19.936
¶ First and last
gone in my universe ¶

42:19.938 --> 42:22.672
¶ Time to move on
and pack your stuff ¶

42:22.674 --> 42:24.774
¶ And run away ¶

42:24.776 --> 42:27.310
¶

42:27.312 --> 42:29.279
¶ I know you think it hurts ¶

42:29.281 --> 42:31.281
¶ I know you think it hurts ¶

42:31.283 --> 42:33.249
¶ I know you think it hurts ¶

42:33.251 --> 42:35.118
¶ I know you think it hurts ¶

42:35.120 --> 42:38.655
¶ I know you think it hurts...¶

42:38.657 --> 42:45.695
¶

42:55.173 --> 42:57.941
If you can imagine this

42:57.943 --> 43:03.313
you can imagine me
anywhere you want.

43:04.249 --> 43:06.816
(birds chirping)

43:11.856 --> 43:21.831
¶

43:22.734 --> 43:25.101
(computer rattling)

43:26.972 --> 43:28.738
Okay.

43:28.740 --> 43:30.940
¶

43:30.942 --> 43:33.643
I mean, I'm assuming, yes,
people work here,

43:33.645 --> 43:34.911
but not on the weekends,

43:34.913 --> 43:37.280
and that's why
they have me come in.

43:37.282 --> 43:39.649
Siri, how do I open a Dell?

43:39.651 --> 43:41.017
Now playing Adele.

43:41.019 --> 43:43.620
(keyboard clacking)

43:43.622 --> 43:45.121
¶

43:45.123 --> 43:47.323
It's mostly just
unplugging stuff

43:47.325 --> 43:49.058
and plugging it back in.

43:49.060 --> 43:50.393
¶

43:50.395 --> 43:52.195
There's free coffee.

43:52.197 --> 43:54.731
I'm not just gonna eat
people's food out of the fridge.

43:54.733 --> 43:56.399
¶

44:09.014 --> 44:12.015
You got this,
you got this.

44:12.017 --> 44:13.182
You're the man.

44:13.184 --> 44:14.417
Who's the man? You're the man.

44:14.419 --> 44:17.186
I'm the man, yeah.

44:17.188 --> 44:19.756
(humming)

44:21.292 --> 44:23.192
Ooh, blueberry!

44:23.194 --> 44:24.994
(chuckling)

44:24.996 --> 44:26.663
Would you fuck me?

44:26.665 --> 44:29.032
I'd fuck me.

44:29.034 --> 44:30.266
I'd fuck me hard.

44:30.268 --> 44:32.702
(laughing)

44:32.704 --> 44:34.404
Yeah, yeah.

44:34.406 --> 44:44.380
¶

44:48.019 --> 44:50.887
(inaudible)

44:50.889 --> 44:52.055
No!

44:52.057 --> 44:53.322
-No way!
-100 percent, yeah.

44:53.324 --> 44:54.424
It was extremely embarrassing.

44:54.426 --> 44:56.125
How much weed did you eat?

44:56.127 --> 44:58.461
Well, like enough to, you know,
pass out in front of,

44:58.463 --> 45:00.096
in front of everybody,
the stewards,

45:00.098 --> 45:01.631
the steward, you know,

45:01.632 --> 45:03.165
-flight operators...
-You're so cute.

45:03.168 --> 45:04.867
...you know,
whatever they're called.

45:04.869 --> 45:07.370
-Oh, my God!
-Mm-hm.

45:07.372 --> 45:08.871
Well, what else happened?

45:08.873 --> 45:10.406
Well, I woke up,

45:10.408 --> 45:12.341
and people were yelling, "Is
there a doctor on the plane?"

45:12.343 --> 45:14.343
-The whole--
-Oh!

45:14.345 --> 45:15.745
Yeah.

45:15.747 --> 45:17.980
-No, I can barely believe that.
-Top ten.

45:17.982 --> 45:19.382
I know, me too.

45:19.384 --> 45:20.483
One of the most
embarrassing things

45:20.485 --> 45:22.085
that's ever happened to me.

45:22.087 --> 45:24.020
But, uh, like,
they let me lay down,

45:24.022 --> 45:26.155
and they kept bringing me
snacks, like orange juice,

45:26.157 --> 45:27.790
-and all this stuff.
-Oh!

45:27.792 --> 45:29.025
-Did they?
-They did.

45:29.027 --> 45:31.227
-Oh, you're on to something.
-Mm.

45:31.229 --> 45:32.428
(laughing)

45:32.430 --> 45:34.197
Uh, baggage claim was

45:34.199 --> 45:36.999
-extremely, extremely awkward.
-Oh, I bet.

45:37.001 --> 45:38.468
Yeah, oh, yeah.

45:38.470 --> 45:40.403
-This pie!
-Yeah, it's so cute!

45:40.405 --> 45:41.971
-It's like a little shot of pie!
-It's so cute!

45:41.973 --> 45:43.172
It's so cute.

45:43.174 --> 45:45.274
I love it, it's little like me!

45:45.276 --> 45:48.745
(laughing)

45:48.747 --> 45:51.214
-Mm, I'm sorry.
-Oh.

45:51.216 --> 45:52.381
¶

45:52.383 --> 45:53.850
You mind if I take this?

45:53.852 --> 45:54.951
-No, it's okay.
-Okay.

45:54.953 --> 45:56.385
-Yeah.
-I'll be back.

45:56.387 --> 45:58.187
-One sec.
-Okay.

45:58.189 --> 46:08.164
¶

46:12.470 --> 46:15.371
Okay, Dad,
have you called 9-1-1?

46:15.373 --> 46:17.373
No, no, I,

46:17.375 --> 46:18.541
I'm in bed.

46:18.543 --> 46:19.909
You're fine?

46:19.911 --> 46:21.377
You feel fine now?

46:21.379 --> 46:23.379
I'm feelin' better,
I just, when I get up,

46:23.381 --> 46:26.082
I feel like everything
starts spinning around.

46:26.084 --> 46:27.350
Well, all right,
if at any point,

46:27.352 --> 46:29.886
this--it feels--you get worse,

46:29.888 --> 46:32.221
you're gonna hang up
and dial 9-1-1, right?

46:32.223 --> 46:33.256
Okay.

46:33.258 --> 46:34.557
-Okay?
-Yeah, okay.

46:34.559 --> 46:36.259
-You promise?
-I promise!

46:36.261 --> 46:39.829
Well, other than this
life-threatening situation,

46:39.831 --> 46:43.132
how are you,
did you catch the game?

46:43.134 --> 46:45.067
Ugh, the game.

46:45.069 --> 46:47.036
That's probably why I'm dyin'.

46:47.038 --> 46:48.571
Dad, you're not dying, okay?

46:48.573 --> 46:49.939
You're not dying.

46:49.941 --> 46:51.240
Those bums, did you see that?

46:51.242 --> 46:53.976
They lost by 20 points!

46:53.978 --> 46:55.244
But, yeah, that was awful.

46:55.246 --> 46:57.814
They, they, they, they,
they blow this year.

46:57.816 --> 47:01.951
They're just gonna have to
suck for a little while, it's--

47:01.953 --> 47:04.220
You're not dying, the point is
you're not dying, okay?

47:04.222 --> 47:07.223
-I don't wanna hear it.
-Eh.

47:07.225 --> 47:09.275
Dad, I can't do this.

47:09.276 --> 47:11.326
I'm gonna call
the paramedics, okay?

47:11.329 --> 47:14.931
¶

47:14.933 --> 47:17.233
Dad, Dad.

47:17.235 --> 47:18.968
Hey, buddy, how's it goin'?

47:18.970 --> 47:20.203
It's goin', how are you?

47:20.205 --> 47:21.938
Me? I'm fine,
I'm feelin' better!

47:21.940 --> 47:23.339
-Yeah?
-Yeah!

47:23.341 --> 47:24.907
Can you get outta bed? What's--?

47:24.909 --> 47:27.043
Well, I got outta bed
a little while ago.

47:27.045 --> 47:28.911
I got a little woozy,
but I feel okay.

47:28.913 --> 47:30.446
Nah, nah, Dad, come on,
we talked about this.

47:30.448 --> 47:32.048
I'm calling,
I'm calling 9-1-1, okay?

47:32.050 --> 47:33.482
-Ah, come on, don't call 9-1-1.
-No, I gotta.

47:33.484 --> 47:34.967
No, really,
you don't have to call.

47:34.968 --> 47:36.451
-Yes, I do!
-Do me a favor, just stay here

47:36.454 --> 47:37.954
with me tonight, that's all.

47:37.956 --> 47:39.455
Let me look up,
I gotta look up the symptoms.

47:39.457 --> 47:42.024
Like, you, like, I--

47:42.026 --> 47:43.337
Well, you can
look up the symptoms.

47:43.338 --> 47:44.649
I don't know what you
think you're gonna find

47:44.650 --> 47:45.961
-over there, I'm fine!
-Well, I'm just, you know,

47:45.964 --> 47:48.197
lookin' 'em--uh, right, right.

47:48.199 --> 47:51.267
Um, okay, well, it could be

47:51.269 --> 47:53.569
a cold, the flu,

47:53.571 --> 47:55.905
indigestion, gas,

47:55.907 --> 47:57.506
stomach cancer,

47:57.508 --> 47:59.308
gonorrhea,

47:59.310 --> 48:02.044
fuckin' super AIDS, I don't

48:02.046 --> 48:05.615
know why I thought
that would help.

48:05.617 --> 48:08.317
I'm callin', I'm doin' it,
I'm callin' 9-1-1, okay?

48:08.319 --> 48:09.585
-Is that what you wanna do?
-Yeah.

48:09.587 --> 48:11.520
Yes, it is, yes.

48:11.522 --> 48:12.989
Yes, I'm--

48:12.991 --> 48:14.557
You wanna call 9-1-1?

48:14.559 --> 48:16.325
Yeah, I'm calling 9-1-1.

48:16.327 --> 48:19.996
-All right, fine, call 9-1-1.
-I'm--yes.

48:19.998 --> 48:24.166
9-1-1? Yeah, of course,
this is an emergency.

48:24.168 --> 48:31.173
¶

48:31.175 --> 48:33.009
What are you staring at?

48:33.011 --> 48:34.944
¶

48:34.946 --> 48:37.013
Guess you're just
a little out of focus.

48:37.015 --> 48:40.449
¶

48:40.451 --> 48:42.518
Hey, buddy, wake up, wake up!

48:42.520 --> 48:44.287
Wake up!

48:44.289 --> 48:45.488
What's up?

48:45.489 --> 48:46.688
-How you feelin' today?
-Oh, well,

48:46.691 --> 48:48.090
better now that you're here.

48:48.092 --> 48:49.292
All right, well, Robert,

48:49.294 --> 48:51.160
tests came back,
everything looks good.

48:51.162 --> 48:53.095
You do have
an inner ear infection,

48:53.097 --> 48:54.263
which can sometimes lead to

48:54.265 --> 48:55.998
dizziness and nausea
at your age,

48:56.000 --> 48:57.633
but everything else looks good.

48:57.635 --> 49:00.303
So, you're actually in
fairly good health.

49:00.305 --> 49:01.504
Just an ear infection!

49:01.506 --> 49:02.438
That's great news.

49:02.440 --> 49:04.040
That's it?

49:04.042 --> 49:06.008
So let me ask you
a question then.

49:06.010 --> 49:08.978
Why'd I fake
my own heart attack?

49:08.980 --> 49:10.613
Think you need a different
kind of doctor for that.

49:10.615 --> 49:13.215
-Thank you, thank you.
-You're welcome.

49:13.217 --> 49:17.687
All right, we'll get you guys
checked out in a second, okay?

49:17.689 --> 49:20.089
Did you see the pair
of hands on her?

49:20.091 --> 49:21.357
(blowing raspberry)

49:21.359 --> 49:22.775
Someone like her,
I should be

49:22.776 --> 49:24.192
fakin' heart attacks
all the time!

49:24.195 --> 49:25.728
-No!
-Wow!

49:25.730 --> 49:27.530
-Yeah!
-I do know, but no.

49:27.532 --> 49:29.298
You know what,
after lookin' at her,

49:29.300 --> 49:31.067
I don't know why
I fought you to come here.

49:31.069 --> 49:33.302
She's not out of the room.

49:33.304 --> 49:34.470
If I'm gonna die,

49:34.472 --> 49:36.172
I don't give a shit what I say.

49:36.174 --> 49:38.641
One, you're not gonna die.

49:38.643 --> 49:40.409
She just told you that,
and two--

49:40.411 --> 49:41.344
Don't take me home.

49:41.346 --> 49:42.762
Leave me here.

49:42.763 --> 49:44.179
You don't want your
last words to be...

49:44.180 --> 49:45.596
'Cause I'm just gonna stay here.

49:45.597 --> 49:47.013
..."Check out the hands
on Dr. Knockers," okay?

49:47.018 --> 49:48.351
Yeah, that's--I would love that!

49:48.353 --> 49:50.119
Put it on my tombstone,
I don't care.

49:50.121 --> 49:51.687
Doesn't matter, who cares?

49:51.689 --> 49:53.456
(laughing)

49:53.458 --> 49:55.024
Yeah, I saw 'em.

50:21.519 --> 50:24.153
Huh, sucks gettin' old.

50:24.155 --> 50:25.521
Yeah, I know.

50:25.523 --> 50:27.590
I mean, I bet.

50:27.592 --> 50:30.092
You know, dyin' sometimes

50:30.094 --> 50:33.329
just scares the shit outta me?

50:33.331 --> 50:36.766
You're just so you about it
though, you're, you know...

50:36.768 --> 50:38.768
-Well, what am I gonna do?
-...nothin' gets to you.

50:38.770 --> 50:40.636
I know, but what am I gonna do,
freak you out?

50:40.638 --> 50:43.706
-I'm not gonna do that.
-I know, I know, I know.

50:43.708 --> 50:45.541
Look, I want you
to know something.

50:45.543 --> 50:48.277
Dad, it's been such
a long night, I can't.

50:48.279 --> 50:51.447
I know, could you just
listen to me for a minute?

50:51.449 --> 50:52.815
-Yeah.
-Your mom,

50:52.816 --> 50:54.182
she's probably gonna
walk into the ocean,

50:54.185 --> 50:57.620
or do some kinda
hippie bullshit.

50:57.622 --> 50:59.622
Not me!

50:59.623 --> 51:01.623
Uh-uh, I'm goin' out
the way I came in,

51:01.626 --> 51:03.492
kickin' and screamin'.

51:03.494 --> 51:06.295
-I believe you.
-You better believe it.

51:08.299 --> 51:10.132
I love you, Dad.

51:10.134 --> 51:11.267
I know.

51:14.806 --> 51:17.440
(patting)

51:17.442 --> 51:19.842
I am gonna go get some sleep.

51:19.844 --> 51:20.709
Go for it.

51:20.711 --> 51:23.379
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

51:23.381 --> 51:24.547
If you're hungry,
have a piece of pie

51:24.549 --> 51:26.615
before you go to bed.

51:26.617 --> 51:28.150
That's a good idea.

51:28.151 --> 51:29.684
-I'll see you in the mornin'.
-See ya, Dad.

51:29.687 --> 51:38.461
¶

52:06.624 --> 52:08.390
(inaudible)

52:08.392 --> 52:18.367
¶

52:32.183 --> 52:36.519
Sweet or savory?

52:36.521 --> 52:38.888
What?

52:38.890 --> 52:42.725
For breakfast,
sweet or savory?

52:42.727 --> 52:45.161
Savory.

52:45.163 --> 52:48.898
Good, 'cause all we have are
eggs, toast, and beans.

52:48.900 --> 52:58.674
¶

52:58.676 --> 53:01.093
So the other night,

53:01.094 --> 53:03.511
I'm watching Return of the Jedi
at my friend's place,

53:03.514 --> 53:05.681
for the 50th time probably,

53:05.683 --> 53:08.250
and there's this big battle
at the end of the movie

53:08.252 --> 53:11.520
between the evil
Empire's storm troopers

53:11.522 --> 53:13.856
and the Ewoks.

53:13.858 --> 53:17.259
And the Ewoks are just
mowin' down storm troopers.

53:17.261 --> 53:19.228
They're killin' 'em
left and right.

53:19.230 --> 53:21.797
And it dawns on me that

53:21.799 --> 53:24.867
every single one
of these storm troopers,

53:24.869 --> 53:27.469
right, is a person.

53:27.471 --> 53:30.573
They're a soldier,
and their entire career

53:30.575 --> 53:33.909
as a storm trooper has
led up to this big battle,

53:33.911 --> 53:35.844
and they're killed
by these little

53:35.846 --> 53:38.581
fuzzy teddy bears.

53:38.583 --> 53:40.783
And then the rest of the movie,

53:40.785 --> 53:42.418
that's all I think about.

53:45.389 --> 53:48.424
Well, clearly, your father's
episode has affected you,

53:48.426 --> 53:51.594
and that's natural.

53:51.596 --> 53:53.762
It turned out he was okay.

53:53.764 --> 53:56.865
So, I mean, I do worry
about him being alone

53:56.867 --> 53:59.401
as much as he is.

53:59.403 --> 54:00.903
How's your dating life?

54:03.608 --> 54:06.375
My dating life is fine.

54:06.377 --> 54:09.645
Are you dating?

54:09.647 --> 54:10.646
Here and there.

54:10.648 --> 54:11.814
What about all the pie dates

54:11.816 --> 54:15.851
-you told me about?
-Right.

54:15.853 --> 54:17.519
I, I want--

54:17.521 --> 54:21.323
We should not call them
pie dates anymore.

54:21.325 --> 54:23.025
Please?

54:23.027 --> 54:26.562
Okay, fair enough,
but they're interesting.

54:26.564 --> 54:30.266
They say something
about your state of mind.

54:30.268 --> 54:33.902
They're fine, in that case.

54:33.904 --> 54:36.305
You're worried about
your father being alone.

54:36.307 --> 54:38.274
Right.

54:38.276 --> 54:41.744
Your father wouldn't be alone
if he hadn't left your mother.

54:41.746 --> 54:46.448
I think deep down,
you realize this.

54:46.450 --> 54:48.417
Are you worried
about being alone?

54:52.723 --> 54:54.507
Uh.

54:54.508 --> 54:56.292
Have you ever thought
about journaling?

54:56.294 --> 54:57.793
No.

54:57.795 --> 55:00.796
Some people like to
write or record their

55:00.798 --> 55:04.333
thoughts or feelings
as a way of archiving them.

55:04.335 --> 55:08.070
Putting their past
experiences behind them.

55:08.072 --> 55:10.072
Why don't you give it a try.

55:10.074 --> 55:12.007
Sure.

55:12.009 --> 55:13.309
Why not?

55:15.980 --> 55:18.714
¶ Don't get too close ¶

55:18.716 --> 55:20.916
What was that about
Aquarians being smarter?

55:20.918 --> 55:22.718
Oh, that they're
smarter than everyone?

55:22.720 --> 55:24.520
Yeah, they're
smarter than everyone.

55:24.522 --> 55:26.355
-Uh-huh.
-It's fact.

55:26.357 --> 55:27.589
But how do you know that?

55:27.591 --> 55:32.828
¶

55:32.830 --> 55:34.530
-'Cause I'm an Aquarius.
-Oh!

55:34.532 --> 55:35.581
You're the only ones who know

55:35.582 --> 55:36.631
that you're smarter
than everyone.

55:36.634 --> 55:38.967
Yeah, otherwise,

55:38.969 --> 55:41.570
the secret would be out,
you know?

55:41.572 --> 55:49.645
¶ Help me fly ¶

55:49.647 --> 55:50.913
This is fuckin' bullshit.

55:50.915 --> 55:54.817
We need to get back on top.

55:54.819 --> 55:56.352
I didn't even know this is real.

55:56.354 --> 55:59.421
With coins,
but they are not real,

55:59.423 --> 56:00.856
but they're coins.

56:00.858 --> 56:02.391
Talkin' about Bitcoin.

56:02.393 --> 56:03.659
The little coins.

56:03.661 --> 56:05.928
(phone ringing)

56:05.930 --> 56:08.697
Okay.

56:08.699 --> 56:10.866
-They're not actual real coins.
-That's what I'm saying,

56:10.868 --> 56:12.634
they're little coins
that are fake.

56:12.636 --> 56:15.437
-Hey, Jackie!
-What up, slut?

56:15.439 --> 56:16.405
How's it goin'?

56:16.407 --> 56:18.140
Just left the bar, going home.

56:18.142 --> 56:20.442
What are you up to?

56:20.444 --> 56:22.678
I am also havin' a beer...

56:22.680 --> 56:24.980
No, it's a thing that exists,
there's cryptocurrencies--

56:24.982 --> 56:27.149
...with friends.

56:27.151 --> 56:28.617
Really?

56:28.619 --> 56:30.552
Don't believe you.

56:30.554 --> 56:31.553
You're at home, aren't you?

56:31.555 --> 56:32.421
Fuckin' liar.

56:32.423 --> 56:34.857
(laughing)

56:34.859 --> 56:36.792
You're gonna
fuck me tonight, right?

56:36.794 --> 56:38.727
-Yeah.
-Yeah!

56:38.729 --> 56:40.562
Come over!

56:40.564 --> 56:42.898
-It is late.
-I'm trying to tell you

56:42.900 --> 56:45.567
about a little coin
you put on the internet.

56:45.569 --> 56:47.569
-That's what I'm saying.
-It's not real!

56:47.571 --> 56:50.072
Shh, you're coming over
already, right?

56:50.074 --> 56:51.140
'Cause I'm down.

56:51.142 --> 56:53.509
Come over right now!

56:53.511 --> 56:54.777
I'm a fuck you!

56:54.779 --> 56:56.779
You're gonna fuck me!

56:56.781 --> 56:58.580
-Or I'm gonna fuck something.
-Okay, yeah, yeah.

56:58.582 --> 57:00.048
-I'll fuck this Uber driver.
-Oh, uh.

57:00.050 --> 57:01.483
-Right now?
-Come over

57:01.485 --> 57:02.985
-right now.
-In 30 minutes, yeah.

57:02.987 --> 57:05.754
Okay, too much talking,
enough talking, bye!

57:05.756 --> 57:07.990
Hello?

57:07.992 --> 57:09.191
Okay.

¶

57:30.514 --> 57:32.881
(heavily breathing)

57:34.218 --> 57:35.150
What's up?

57:35.152 --> 57:45.127
¶

58:19.096 --> 58:21.196
Coffee machine out?

58:21.198 --> 58:24.199
Yup, looks like it.

58:24.201 --> 58:25.534
You try, uh,

58:25.536 --> 58:27.736
unplugging it
and plugging it back in?

58:32.042 --> 58:36.645
It's an I, IT joke.

58:36.647 --> 58:38.013
(awkwardly chuckling)

58:41.051 --> 58:43.151
So it started with

58:43.153 --> 58:45.153
my therapist suggesting that I

58:45.155 --> 58:47.189
-keep a journal.
-Mm-hm.

58:47.191 --> 58:50.626
Um, but, I'm not
a 14 year-old girl...

58:50.628 --> 58:51.894
-No.
-...anymore.

58:51.896 --> 58:53.295
-Yeah.
-So,

58:53.297 --> 58:55.130
I thought I'd try writing
something, you know,

58:55.132 --> 58:56.582
substantial.

58:56.583 --> 58:58.033
-Nice.
-Yeah, I don't know.

58:58.035 --> 58:59.568
You write anything?

59:03.040 --> 59:05.574
I write jokes.

59:05.576 --> 59:06.975
I have a regular spot

59:06.977 --> 59:08.677
every Friday night

59:08.679 --> 59:11.246
in the annex of the Rusty Hole.

59:11.248 --> 59:12.814
Oh.

59:12.816 --> 59:15.117
Can you, uh,
can you tell me a joke?

59:15.119 --> 59:17.152
I have a joke.

59:17.154 --> 59:19.721
What do you call a little person

59:19.723 --> 59:21.089
who is a psychic,

59:21.091 --> 59:25.561
who has just
escaped from prison?

59:25.563 --> 59:28.030
I don't know.

59:28.032 --> 59:29.865
A small medium

59:29.867 --> 59:31.967
at large.

59:31.969 --> 59:33.735
(laughing)

59:33.737 --> 59:36.772
That's...

59:36.774 --> 59:39.641
-Uh.
-You wanna split that cookie?

59:39.643 --> 59:49.618
¶

1:00:08.372 --> 1:00:10.172
-Jesus fuck!
-Where you goin'?

1:00:10.174 --> 1:00:11.940
I'm goin' out, man.

1:00:11.942 --> 1:00:13.375
And I'm wearing this shirt,
I can't--

1:00:13.377 --> 1:00:15.277
-Don't.
-What?

1:00:15.279 --> 1:00:17.346
Don't start with the shirt.

1:00:17.348 --> 1:00:19.314
I'm, I'm getting pie,

1:00:19.316 --> 1:00:20.649
I'm wearing this shirt,

1:00:20.651 --> 1:00:22.851
-she's buying.
-With who?

1:00:22.853 --> 1:00:24.686
-You know who.
-Jackie?

1:00:24.688 --> 1:00:27.189
Wasn't that her, like, last
night at 2:00 in the morning?

1:00:27.191 --> 1:00:28.924
It was.

1:00:28.926 --> 1:00:30.225
What happened?

1:00:32.062 --> 1:00:34.630
(heavily breathing)

1:00:38.202 --> 1:00:40.235
(sighing)

1:00:40.237 --> 1:00:42.104
Dude, fuck that chick.

1:00:42.106 --> 1:00:43.171
Seriously.

1:00:43.173 --> 1:00:44.973
I'm, I'm trying.

1:00:44.975 --> 1:00:46.742
You gotta give me a break.

1:00:46.744 --> 1:00:48.343
Like, get her outta your life.

1:00:48.345 --> 1:00:50.012
Okay? Seriously.

1:00:50.014 --> 1:00:52.364
What?

1:00:52.365 --> 1:00:54.715
What I'm saying, okay,
is that, like,

1:00:54.718 --> 1:00:56.752
she is taking advantage of you,

1:00:56.754 --> 1:00:58.387
and I think that she knows that.

1:00:58.389 --> 1:01:03.091
And I, and I really think that
you just need to cut ties.

1:01:03.093 --> 1:01:05.027
I honestly--
You're such a great guy,

1:01:05.029 --> 1:01:08.030
and I just think that, you know,

1:01:08.032 --> 1:01:09.297
life's too short.

1:01:09.299 --> 1:01:11.867
Okay.

1:01:11.869 --> 1:01:14.102
Sometimes the fucking you get

1:01:14.104 --> 1:01:17.305
ain't worth the fucking
you're gonna get.

1:01:17.307 --> 1:01:20.342
And I just think that

1:01:20.344 --> 1:01:21.943
it's time to just move on, dude.

1:01:21.945 --> 1:01:23.412
Are you hungry?

1:01:23.414 --> 1:01:25.347
¶

1:01:25.349 --> 1:01:27.049
Fucking starving, dude.

-Okay, one for you.
-Sweet, dude.

1:01:42.399 --> 1:01:44.132
Just got a killer match
on Tinder as well.

1:01:44.134 --> 1:01:46.368
-Oh, did you?
-About fuckin' time.

1:01:46.370 --> 1:01:48.270
You gonna take her out for pie?

1:01:48.272 --> 1:01:49.304
More like pizza.

1:01:49.306 --> 1:01:50.806
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

How do we make delicious,
inexpensive home cooking

a regular part of our lives?

Taste of Home, that's how.

-So grab A Taste of Ho--
-What are you doing?

1:03:08.519 --> 1:03:09.951
I'm taking the label off,
it, uh,

1:03:09.953 --> 1:03:11.386
-has a price tag on it.
-All right, good,

1:03:11.388 --> 1:03:12.420
yeah, that's a good call.

1:03:12.422 --> 1:03:14.523
Oh, how late are we?

1:03:14.525 --> 1:03:15.957
Twenty minutes, should we knock?

1:03:15.959 --> 1:03:17.325
I don't know.

1:03:17.327 --> 1:03:19.227
-Well, fuck it.
-Uh, well,

-All right, whatever.

1:03:44.922 --> 1:03:46.454
No ma'am.

1:03:46.456 --> 1:03:47.856
Mm-mm.

1:03:47.858 --> 1:03:49.474

-Nolan, my love...
-Yes, dear?

...we're gonna put you
over here on chicken duty.

Garret, you're just gonna

1:03:56.133 --> 1:03:57.432
wait there until
we have something ready,

1:03:57.434 --> 1:03:59.568
and then you can take it
into the living room.

1:03:59.570 --> 1:04:01.069
-You!
-Me!

1:04:01.071 --> 1:04:02.971
You are gonna be
on appetizer duty

Yay!

Yes, just nice and pretty.

You are the worst!

1:04:22.226 --> 1:04:23.925
I'm okay.

Is that what you
tell all the ladies?

1:04:26.163 --> 1:04:28.864
Maybe.

1:04:28.866 --> 1:04:30.398
What are you guys doing?

1:04:30.400 --> 1:04:32.267
We're gonna go drinking.

1:04:32.269 --> 1:04:35.103
Yeah, where the hell
is the wine?

1:04:35.105 --> 1:04:36.171
Hey, hey!

1:04:36.173 --> 1:04:37.472
No, you're waiting for us

1:04:37.474 --> 1:04:38.640
to get something together.

1:04:38.642 --> 1:04:40.141
-In the meantime--
-And then bringing it.

-So good to see you!
-Oh, our brand,

1:04:58.996 --> 1:05:01.429
that was nice of you.

1:05:01.431 --> 1:05:05.500

-Yeah, should we open it?

It's like the first wine
I've had in weeks.

1:05:35.299 --> 1:05:37.198
Why, 'cause you still
had the juice before?

1:05:37.200 --> 1:05:38.934
-Oh, God.
-No, you didn't.

1:05:38.936 --> 1:05:40.502
-You did it?
-I did it.

1:05:40.504 --> 1:05:42.337
-I regret it.
-Oh, my God, tell me.

1:05:42.339 --> 1:05:43.939
It was horrible,
you know I need my carbs.

1:05:43.941 --> 1:05:45.674
-Yes!
-Right, and then none.

1:05:45.676 --> 1:05:48.109
-Oh, my God.
-It's just liquids going in.

Yeah, fruits, veggie, nothing.

1:05:51.181 --> 1:05:53.281
You gotta get all--I mean,
do you know how much

1:05:53.283 --> 1:05:55.083
I'm about to eat tonight?

1:05:55.085 --> 1:05:57.686
Turkey blackout, bitch!

Ah, it's gonna be so good!

1:05:59.623 --> 1:06:01.990
I got these three
clients now, you know.

1:06:01.992 --> 1:06:03.491
I guess, to be honest,

1:06:03.493 --> 1:06:06.127
it's really just,
it's overwhelming, man.

1:06:06.129 --> 1:06:08.463
Like, I want the food baby
to be so exaggerated

1:06:08.465 --> 1:06:10.298
that it looks like
I'm like six months pregnant.

1:06:10.300 --> 1:06:11.333
And we're all like,
"What happened?"

1:06:11.335 --> 1:06:13.234
-Exactly.
-Okay, right.

1:06:13.236 --> 1:06:15.036
That's why I wore,
like, the kinda flowy

1:06:15.038 --> 1:06:16.137
-material.
-And it's like I'm on this

1:06:16.139 --> 1:06:19.374
rotation of, like,
every six hours,

1:06:19.376 --> 1:06:21.109
just non-stop,
you know what I mean?

1:06:21.111 --> 1:06:23.678
And it's like,
I'm lucky if I only sleep like

1:06:23.680 --> 1:06:25.013
four hours a night.

1:06:25.015 --> 1:06:27.248
-It's Ryan, right?
-Yeah.

It's nice to meet you.

1:06:28.352 --> 1:06:29.484
Nice bow tie.

Thank you, bow ties are,

1:06:31.054 --> 1:06:34.122
-bow ties are cool.

Come on, no,
it's not Friendsgiving.

Are you kidding,
I can barely take

1:07:05.021 --> 1:07:06.254
-care of myself.
-Do you want me

1:07:06.255 --> 1:07:07.488
-to do the speech, instead?
-Yeah!

All right.

1:07:17.200 --> 1:07:19.334
-Cheers to that.
-Cheers.

1:07:21.638 --> 1:07:23.538
Anyway,

1:07:23.540 --> 1:07:25.306
as some of you know,

1:07:25.308 --> 1:07:28.676
some of us are
coming up on ten years

1:07:28.678 --> 1:07:31.179
of being friends
with each other.

1:07:31.181 --> 1:07:32.414
-We did it.
-Don't say it out loud!

1:07:32.416 --> 1:07:33.815
I know, it's crazy!

1:07:33.817 --> 1:07:35.750
And it's because
we love each other.

1:07:35.752 --> 1:07:38.053
-We do.
-And we're there for each other

1:07:38.055 --> 1:07:40.221
-no matter what.
-Ugh, can we eat already?

1:07:40.223 --> 1:07:43.358
And we will always
be there for each other.

1:07:43.360 --> 1:07:45.227
You hear that?

1:07:45.228 --> 1:07:47.095
-No matter what.
-You talkin' about me?

1:07:47.097 --> 1:07:49.631
-Here, here!
-That was right to you.

1:07:49.633 --> 1:07:52.667
Quicker we toast,
the quicker we eat.

five, I think.

I consume pie,
I don't actually make it.

-How do you do that?

1:08:53.763 --> 1:08:55.463
Uh, what?

Love something,
at the same time,

1:08:56.766 --> 1:08:59.434
squeeze the fuckin'
life out of it.

1:08:59.436 --> 1:09:00.768
Fuck you.

Not like a ghosting
exactly, but, yeah.

1:09:58.562 --> 1:10:01.262
Just didn't call.

meet a girl and save her.

what to tell you,

saving everyone.

The writing is okay.

1:11:14.004 --> 1:11:17.338
Uh, I haven't, I haven't
been writing lately.

1:11:17.340 --> 1:11:19.274
How come?

1:11:19.276 --> 1:11:21.843
Um, how do I write
something that I

1:11:21.845 --> 1:11:24.379
kind of don't know yet?

1:11:24.381 --> 1:11:26.681
The big, the big
question in it is

1:11:26.683 --> 1:11:27.915
who does the character
end up with?

1:11:27.917 --> 1:11:31.586
So, who do I end up with?

1:11:31.588 --> 1:11:36.591
Maybe you don't wanna
end up with anyone.

1:11:36.593 --> 1:11:38.059
Maybe.

1:11:38.061 --> 1:11:39.961
Seems kinda bleak though.

1:11:39.963 --> 1:11:41.996
Maybe you don't want
there to be an ending.

1:11:41.998 --> 1:11:44.432
¶

1:11:44.434 --> 1:11:46.367
No one likes endings.

1:11:46.369 --> 1:11:49.404
¶

1:11:49.406 --> 1:11:51.806
Do you remember
the last day of high school?

1:11:51.808 --> 1:11:53.608
Of course.

1:11:53.610 --> 1:11:56.544
I had a lacrosse game,
and...

1:11:56.546 --> 1:11:58.680
(sighing)

1:11:58.682 --> 1:11:59.981
...it was such a hard season,

1:11:59.983 --> 1:12:02.850
the coach, Ms. Muskin,
she yelled at me

1:12:02.852 --> 1:12:04.619
all season long,
"Get the ball!

1:12:04.621 --> 1:12:06.621
Go faster, shoot harder!"

1:12:06.623 --> 1:12:09.624
Ugh, I was so
ready to graduate

1:12:09.626 --> 1:12:12.460
and play in college.

1:12:12.462 --> 1:12:15.063
And then after that last game...

1:12:15.065 --> 1:12:17.565
(sighing)

1:12:17.567 --> 1:12:20.001
...I just sat in
the locker room and bawled.

1:12:20.003 --> 1:12:22.837
(inaudible)

1:12:22.838 --> 1:12:25.672
'Cause I realized I was never
gonna play for Ms. Muskin again.

1:12:25.675 --> 1:12:28.076
I was never gonna

1:12:28.078 --> 1:12:31.879
be with my friends, and--

1:12:31.881 --> 1:12:34.449
it was over,
and it was horrible.

1:12:34.451 --> 1:12:36.050
¶

1:12:36.052 --> 1:12:37.018
No one likes endings,

1:12:37.020 --> 1:12:41.756
but they're a part of life.

1:12:41.758 --> 1:12:44.359
(inaudible)

1:12:44.361 --> 1:12:47.028
¶

1:12:47.030 --> 1:12:49.697
Man.

1:12:49.699 --> 1:12:51.499
You know,

1:12:51.501 --> 1:12:53.801
sometimes I come in here

1:12:53.803 --> 1:12:55.570
in a pretty even mood,

1:12:55.572 --> 1:12:58.139
and I leave just
totally fucked up.

1:12:58.141 --> 1:12:59.907
(laughing)

1:12:59.909 --> 1:13:01.976
-Yeah, I bet.
-Uh-huh.

1:13:01.978 --> 1:13:04.078
-One more service I provide.
-Right, right.

1:13:04.080 --> 1:13:06.114
Thank you.

1:13:06.116 --> 1:13:14.655
¶

1:13:14.657 --> 1:13:16.424
Oh, I didn't see you there.

1:13:16.426 --> 1:13:18.092
¶

1:13:18.094 --> 1:13:19.160
Hello, students!

1:13:19.162 --> 1:13:20.728
Welcome back to another episode

1:13:20.730 --> 1:13:22.397
of Moonlight Bakers Club.

1:13:22.399 --> 1:13:25.166
I'm your teacher,
Ms. Cherry, and tonight

1:13:25.168 --> 1:13:27.402
we'll be baking a peach cobbler.

1:13:27.404 --> 1:13:29.437
Let's get started!

1:13:29.439 --> 1:13:31.406
All right, bakers,
so first things first,

1:13:31.408 --> 1:13:32.974
we're gonna make our pie crust.

1:13:32.976 --> 1:13:35.810
So we're gonna bring together
flour, salt, and sugar

1:13:35.812 --> 1:13:39.447
and combine until it's
just flakey and perfect.

1:13:39.449 --> 1:13:41.949
Next up, we add cold butter
and shortening to the mixture,

1:13:41.951 --> 1:13:43.751
process for about 10 seconds

1:13:43.753 --> 1:13:46.521
until it begins to look
like a coarse meal texture.

1:13:46.523 --> 1:13:48.022
¶

1:13:48.024 --> 1:13:49.424
Next step,
we're gonna drizzle in

1:13:49.426 --> 1:13:51.959
three tablespoons of cold water.

1:13:51.961 --> 1:13:54.028
And once it begins
to clump together, stop.

1:13:54.030 --> 1:13:56.164
You may need to add
one more tablespoon

1:13:56.166 --> 1:13:58.599
of this cold water
for it to come together.

1:13:58.601 --> 1:14:01.636
¶

1:14:01.638 --> 1:14:03.171
Roll the dough
with a rolling pin

1:14:03.173 --> 1:14:04.705
to about a 12-inch circle

1:14:04.707 --> 1:14:06.441
and transfer to a pie plate.

1:14:06.443 --> 1:14:07.909
¶

1:14:07.911 --> 1:14:10.711
And remember guys, don't
panic if it's not perfect.

1:14:10.713 --> 1:14:12.647
You can fix it
in the pie plate later.

1:14:12.649 --> 1:14:14.649
It's just baking!

1:14:14.651 --> 1:14:16.184
All right, now that
our crust is set,

1:14:16.186 --> 1:14:17.519
we're gonna shift gears

1:14:17.520 --> 1:14:18.853
and make our peach
cobbler filling.

1:14:18.855 --> 1:14:20.054
All right,
to prepare the peaches,

1:14:20.056 --> 1:14:21.189
you'll slice or dice,

1:14:21.191 --> 1:14:23.891
and then place them
into the pie dish.

1:14:23.893 --> 1:14:26.060
Once they're in the pie dish,
you'll sprinkle the peaches

1:14:26.062 --> 1:14:28.463
with your sugar, corn starch,

1:14:28.465 --> 1:14:30.015
mix evenly,

1:14:30.016 --> 1:14:31.566
and spread out
throughout the dish.

1:14:31.568 --> 1:14:36.103
¶

1:14:36.105 --> 1:14:37.872
To create your cobbler batter,

1:14:37.874 --> 1:14:39.740
you'll bring together
in a large bowl

1:14:39.742 --> 1:14:44.479
your butter, sugar,
vanilla, and milk.

1:14:44.481 --> 1:14:46.681
(inaudible)

1:14:46.683 --> 1:14:48.182
From there,
you'll add your flour,

1:14:48.184 --> 1:14:50.685
baking powder, and salt
into the mixture

1:14:50.687 --> 1:14:51.953
and combine well.

1:14:51.955 --> 1:14:53.588
The batter will be thick

1:14:53.589 --> 1:14:55.222
with a cookie
dough-like consistency.

1:14:55.225 --> 1:14:57.091
Using a spatula,
or your hands,

1:14:57.093 --> 1:14:59.060
sprinkle the batter
on top of the peaches

1:14:59.062 --> 1:15:00.194
spread out just a little bit.

1:15:00.196 --> 1:15:01.596
It doesn't have to be perfect

1:15:01.598 --> 1:15:04.699
or cover all the peaches.

1:15:04.701 --> 1:15:05.867
And the last step,

1:15:05.869 --> 1:15:07.568
bake for 30 to 35 minutes,

1:15:07.570 --> 1:15:09.237
or until the crust
is golden brown

1:15:09.239 --> 1:15:11.606
and the peaches
are just bubbling.

1:15:11.608 --> 1:15:12.740
Let's bake!

1:15:12.742 --> 1:15:19.847

1:17:17.667 --> 1:17:20.668
¶

1:17:28.311 --> 1:17:30.878
Oh, I have a fuckin' moustache.

1:17:33.016 --> 1:17:36.951
-Wow, you finally cut your hair!
-Oh, yeah!

1:17:36.953 --> 1:17:39.053
-Look at you!
-Thanks for, thanks for,

1:17:39.055 --> 1:17:40.021
thanks for meeting me,

1:17:40.023 --> 1:17:42.156
and seeing the new me.

1:17:42.158 --> 1:17:43.090
Yeah!

1:17:43.092 --> 1:17:44.141
Sort of.

1:17:44.142 --> 1:17:45.191
I think it's an improvement.

1:17:45.194 --> 1:17:46.961
-Thank you.
-You look very nice.

1:17:46.963 --> 1:17:48.796
-Aw, you do too.
-Oh, thank you.

1:17:48.798 --> 1:17:50.398
-Oh, yes.
-I was feeling festive.

1:17:50.400 --> 1:17:52.033
-So festive!
-You know,

1:17:52.035 --> 1:17:54.435
you can never go wrong with
a good crisscrossed sleeve.

1:17:54.437 --> 1:17:56.003
Or...

1:17:56.005 --> 1:17:57.004
A pattern.

1:17:57.006 --> 1:17:58.239
...or a pattern!

1:17:58.241 --> 1:18:00.041
A bold, strong pattern.

1:18:00.043 --> 1:18:01.909
It's a bold,
it's my power shirt.

1:18:01.911 --> 1:18:03.144
Good!

1:18:03.146 --> 1:18:05.196
It's not, I don't know.

1:18:05.197 --> 1:18:07.247
Let's get some ice cream
from Half Baked Ice Cream.

1:18:07.250 --> 1:18:08.416
-It's gonna be really good.
-Okay.

1:18:08.418 --> 1:18:10.351
I'm really excited.

1:18:10.353 --> 1:18:12.953
Oh, it even smells good.

1:18:12.955 --> 1:18:15.089
Okay, so don't
judge me on my choices,

1:18:15.091 --> 1:18:16.223
'cause I might go
with more than one.

1:18:16.225 --> 1:18:17.458
This is your show.

1:18:17.460 --> 1:18:19.293
Okay.

1:18:19.295 --> 1:18:21.062
Oh, God, this is hard!

1:18:21.064 --> 1:18:23.030
They have everything I like.

1:18:23.032 --> 1:18:24.432
It's like a whole--There should
be, like, a whole section

1:18:24.434 --> 1:18:26.801
just devoted to chocolate,

1:18:26.803 --> 1:18:29.236
and then just vanilla can have,
like, one flavor over there

1:18:29.238 --> 1:18:31.972
next to the,
next to the gross sherbet.

1:18:31.974 --> 1:18:33.741
-That that colorful one?
-Yes!

1:18:33.743 --> 1:18:36.077
-Okay.
-That's like eight flavors.

1:18:36.079 --> 1:18:37.845
And it's just ice.

1:18:37.847 --> 1:18:41.415
-Like, no, it doesn't belong.
-No!

1:18:41.417 --> 1:18:43.117
It doesn't belong,
it needs to go.

1:18:43.119 --> 1:18:44.686
I'm just gonna agree with

1:18:44.687 --> 1:18:46.254
whatever you have
to say anyway, so.

1:18:46.255 --> 1:18:47.822
Excellent, that's
the right way to go about it.

1:18:47.824 --> 1:18:50.157
-I'm always right.
-Yes.

1:18:50.159 --> 1:18:52.093
-Everything.
-You're right.

1:18:52.095 --> 1:18:53.494
I could say the stupidest thing,

1:18:53.496 --> 1:18:54.929
and you would say...

1:18:54.931 --> 1:18:56.030
I agree.

1:18:56.032 --> 1:18:57.732
-Or laugh.
-Mm-hm.

1:18:57.733 --> 1:18:59.433
-It depends on what comes first.
-Yeah.

1:18:59.435 --> 1:19:01.035
Depends on what
naturally happens.

1:19:01.037 --> 1:19:02.403
I'm not sweaty.

1:19:02.405 --> 1:19:04.805
-I'm fine.
-I'm, uh, it's fine.

1:19:04.807 --> 1:19:07.174
(laughing)

1:19:08.311 --> 1:19:11.145
-So, question.
-Yes?

1:19:11.147 --> 1:19:12.747
Why didn't you call me?

1:19:12.749 --> 1:19:14.348
-Oh, right, right.
-Mm-hm.

1:19:14.350 --> 1:19:17.118
-Had to happen sometime.
-Yeah, well,

1:19:17.120 --> 1:19:18.252
it was real,

1:19:18.254 --> 1:19:19.887
you know?

1:19:19.888 --> 1:19:21.521
You're--I, I can't
run away from you.

1:19:21.524 --> 1:19:23.057
I mean, I know I
ran away from you...

1:19:23.059 --> 1:19:24.859
-A little bit.
-...just a little bit,

1:19:24.861 --> 1:19:27.128
but, like, I can't, like,
you know, you're my friend,

1:19:27.130 --> 1:19:28.980
you know, we've got
the same friend group.

1:19:28.981 --> 1:19:30.831
I couldn't, you know,
I had to face it at some point.

1:19:30.833 --> 1:19:32.266
Mm.

1:19:32.268 --> 1:19:34.101
-Okay, I'll take it.
-You know.

1:19:34.103 --> 1:19:35.436
Okay.

1:19:35.438 --> 1:19:36.837
Real stuff, huh?

1:19:36.839 --> 1:19:38.072
-Real stuff.
-Mm.

1:19:38.074 --> 1:19:39.874
With real feelings
and everything.

1:19:39.876 --> 1:19:41.375
Right, right.

1:19:41.377 --> 1:19:43.544
You're still the worst.

1:19:43.546 --> 1:19:45.312
But you have your moments.

1:19:45.314 --> 1:19:46.514
Rare.

1:19:46.516 --> 1:19:47.515
Rare.

1:19:47.517 --> 1:19:50.251
(laughing)

1:19:50.253 --> 1:19:53.821
Okay, speaking of real,
I got one more.

1:19:53.823 --> 1:19:55.189
Real answer,

1:19:55.191 --> 1:19:56.457
why pie?

1:19:56.459 --> 1:19:59.460
-Why, pie, huh?
-Mm-hm.

1:19:59.462 --> 1:20:01.829
Well, way back when...

1:20:01.831 --> 1:20:03.481
Right.

1:20:03.482 --> 1:20:05.132
-...I, uh, I met a girl.
-Mm-hm.

1:20:05.134 --> 1:20:07.468
-And we went out on a date.
-Mm-hm.

1:20:07.470 --> 1:20:09.036
And it was just normal,
it was dinner,

1:20:09.038 --> 1:20:10.471
and drinks,
and the whole, you know.

1:20:10.473 --> 1:20:12.072
-Wow!
-And it went really well,

1:20:12.074 --> 1:20:13.374
so there was a second date.

1:20:13.376 --> 1:20:14.575
-Mm-hm.
-And on that second date,

1:20:14.577 --> 1:20:18.946
I had to pick something
besides an $80 dinner.

1:20:18.948 --> 1:20:20.214
It was a long time ago,
you know.

1:20:20.216 --> 1:20:22.016
Right.

1:20:22.017 --> 1:20:23.817
And a coffee's kind of
like a business date.

1:20:23.820 --> 1:20:25.820
Mm-hm.

1:20:25.822 --> 1:20:27.087
And, you know,

1:20:27.089 --> 1:20:28.589
drinks are a little
presumptuous,

1:20:28.591 --> 1:20:30.057
so I settled on pie.

1:20:30.059 --> 1:20:31.458
It's kind of like a nice, easy,

1:20:31.460 --> 1:20:32.960
-in the middle thing.
-Mm-hm.

1:20:32.962 --> 1:20:34.395
And it was great,
it was a great date,

1:20:34.397 --> 1:20:36.263
and we fell in love,

1:20:36.265 --> 1:20:38.065
and did all the things,

1:20:38.067 --> 1:20:40.935
and then she got sick,

1:20:40.937 --> 1:20:43.504
and she died.

1:20:46.342 --> 1:20:47.842
I'm just fuckin' with you.

1:20:47.843 --> 1:20:49.343
-I'm sorry, she's--
-What the--?

1:20:49.345 --> 1:20:50.845
You're--What's wrong with you?

1:20:50.847 --> 1:20:51.979
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

1:20:51.980 --> 1:20:53.112
-I just like--
-That's horrible!

1:20:53.115 --> 1:20:54.982
I saw an opening--She's fine!

1:20:54.984 --> 1:20:57.218
-She just, she just moved away.
-Okay, was any of that

1:20:57.220 --> 1:20:58.485
-story real?
-All real, I swear.

1:20:58.487 --> 1:20:59.486
She just, she just moved away.

1:20:59.488 --> 1:21:00.588
She's alive.

1:21:00.590 --> 1:21:03.023
Oh, my God!

1:21:03.025 --> 1:21:04.425
Oh, you're terr--
I don't believe you.

1:21:04.427 --> 1:21:06.126
But when she moved away,
we, like, you know,

1:21:06.128 --> 1:21:07.228
it was hard,

1:21:07.230 --> 1:21:08.229
you know, we broke up.

1:21:08.231 --> 1:21:10.564
-And, uh--
-Mm-hm.

1:21:10.566 --> 1:21:12.266
The first, like,
when I started dating again,

1:21:12.268 --> 1:21:14.335
the first thing
that came to mind was,

1:21:14.337 --> 1:21:15.436
was pie.

1:21:15.438 --> 1:21:17.071
And then it just, you know,

1:21:17.073 --> 1:21:19.573
-snowballed outta control.
-Right, just, just completely.

1:21:19.575 --> 1:21:21.208
-Mm-hm.
-All the way down the hill.

1:21:21.210 --> 1:21:23.377
Yeah.

1:21:23.379 --> 1:21:24.645
I can't believe you.

1:21:24.647 --> 1:21:26.580
You're terrible.

1:21:28.584 --> 1:21:30.351
-Okay, you comin'?
-I'm comin'!

1:21:30.353 --> 1:21:33.621
(laughing)

1:21:33.623 --> 1:21:35.122
But ice cream, though, you know?

1:21:35.124 --> 1:21:36.957
-Yeah, always a good choice.
-It's good.

1:21:36.959 --> 1:21:38.993
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1:21:38.995 --> 1:21:40.261
Oh, my God, I got
some of your vanilla in there.

1:21:40.263 --> 1:21:41.395
Oh, no!

1:21:41.397 --> 1:21:43.163
(laughing)

1:21:43.165 --> 1:21:50.905
¶

1:21:50.907 --> 1:21:52.940
What do you guys think?

1:21:52.942 --> 1:21:54.308
It's good, yeah.

1:21:54.310 --> 1:21:56.243
I mean, I like it,
it's definitely the most

1:21:56.245 --> 1:21:58.212
relatable thing
you've ever written.

1:21:58.214 --> 1:21:59.780
Relatable's good.

1:21:59.781 --> 1:22:01.347
It's good, but your character,

1:22:01.350 --> 1:22:04.184
I think that there are
contexts and scenes that are

1:22:04.186 --> 1:22:06.020
a little bit unrealistic.

1:22:06.022 --> 1:22:07.955
-Here, let me just--
-But it--Okay.

1:22:07.957 --> 1:22:10.057
-But it really happened.
-Why would a guy

1:22:10.059 --> 1:22:11.625
who's tryin' to find love

1:22:11.627 --> 1:22:14.061
go on Tinder, and then
go on these pie dates?

1:22:14.063 --> 1:22:15.229
It just doesn't make sense.

1:22:15.231 --> 1:22:17.665
Everyone goes on Tinder
for one reason.

1:22:17.667 --> 1:22:19.333
But that's not necessarily true.

1:22:19.334 --> 1:22:21.000
It is fuckin' true,
allow me to tell you why.

1:22:21.003 --> 1:22:23.170
Everyone is thinkin'
in binary, bro.

1:22:23.172 --> 1:22:24.972
Ones and zeroes,
yes or nos.

1:22:24.974 --> 1:22:26.340
Dude, what are you
talkin' about?

1:22:26.342 --> 1:22:28.275
Binary?

1:22:28.277 --> 1:22:30.611
People go on Tinder dates
for all types of reasons.

1:22:30.613 --> 1:22:32.380
It's about the experience.

1:22:32.381 --> 1:22:34.148
You know, hopefully you
meet someone that you can,

1:22:34.150 --> 1:22:35.382
you know, go on
another date with,

1:22:35.384 --> 1:22:37.217
who you like to
actually talk to.

1:22:37.219 --> 1:22:39.219
No one finds love on Tinder,
that's all I'm sayin'.

1:22:39.221 --> 1:22:41.105
How do you not--

1:22:41.106 --> 1:22:42.990
Not everyone can just
live their life without emotion.

1:22:42.992 --> 1:22:45.726
Like, you need some
level of emotion to--

1:22:45.728 --> 1:22:47.728
Look at me, I'm very happy.

1:22:47.730 --> 1:22:48.662
Look at you.

1:22:48.664 --> 1:22:50.998
So you guys would watch this?

1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:54.034
I'd watch just about anything,
but yes, I'd watch this.

1:22:54.036 --> 1:22:56.337
If I didn't know
you were making it,

1:22:56.339 --> 1:22:58.305
no.

1:22:58.307 --> 1:23:01.108
But my whole point is that

1:23:01.110 --> 1:23:03.310
in order to feel
better about myself

1:23:03.312 --> 1:23:05.346
out in the real world
and I was just recently single,

1:23:05.348 --> 1:23:08.582
sure, yes, I would watch it.

1:23:08.584 --> 1:23:10.985
So what's the title?

1:23:10.987 --> 1:23:13.454
I don't know,
I had Pie Stories.

1:23:13.456 --> 1:23:15.089
Pie Stories?

1:23:15.091 --> 1:23:18.158
What about, like, Pieland?

1:23:18.160 --> 1:23:20.728
Like Thailand, but Pieland.

1:23:20.730 --> 1:23:22.463
-We'll work on that.
-How 'bout, uh,

1:23:22.465 --> 1:23:24.431
how 'bout Pie Hard?

1:23:24.433 --> 1:23:26.433
Or, or True Pies.

1:23:26.435 --> 1:23:29.436
You know, True Lies,
True Pies?

1:23:29.438 --> 1:23:31.205
-Like the movie?
-Or, or Pie-o-dome?

1:23:31.207 --> 1:23:33.207
Ooh, Pie-o-dome!

1:23:33.209 --> 1:23:34.608
Okay, okay, we're rolling.

1:23:34.610 --> 1:23:37.077
I was thinking Me, Myself,
and Pie's not a bad idea.

1:23:37.079 --> 1:23:39.146
-I like that.
-Thank you, right.

1:23:39.148 --> 1:23:40.614
Pies Wide Shut, Pies Wide Shut!

1:23:40.616 --> 1:23:42.383
(laughing)

1:23:42.385 --> 1:23:44.651
-Oh, sexual.
-Um.

1:23:44.653 --> 1:23:46.453
A Million Ways
to Pie in the West.

1:23:46.455 --> 1:23:48.389
-Okay.
-But it's not a Western though.

1:23:48.391 --> 1:23:50.124
Um.

1:23:50.126 --> 1:23:53.060
-No, it's not a Western.
-He's right.

1:23:53.062 --> 1:23:54.762
Um, Collateral Pies?

1:23:54.764 --> 1:23:56.330
Uh, Pies--

1:23:56.332 --> 1:23:57.464
Pie-rates of the Caribbean.

1:23:57.466 --> 1:23:58.599
Pirates of the Caribbean?

1:23:58.601 --> 1:23:59.767
Pie-rates, Pie.

1:23:59.769 --> 1:24:01.368
That's just the name of a movie!

1:24:01.370 --> 1:24:04.705
No, like the pie, you know,

1:24:04.707 --> 1:24:06.140
-there's a pirate.
-There's no,

1:24:06.142 --> 1:24:07.174
there's no joke there.

1:24:07.176 --> 1:24:08.642
It's just the name of a movie.

1:24:08.644 --> 1:24:10.177
I mean, fuck it.

1:24:10.179 --> 1:24:12.279
-How 'bout American Pie?
-Ah.

1:24:12.281 --> 1:24:13.480
That's the same thing!

1:24:13.482 --> 1:24:15.049
-That's worse!
-Canadian Pie,

1:24:15.051 --> 1:24:16.667
-whatever, dude.
-That's nothing.

1:24:16.668 --> 1:24:18.284
-That's just a made up name.
-It'll be an appropriation

1:24:18.287 --> 1:24:19.553
of American Pie.

1:24:19.555 --> 1:24:23.123
-Uh, Romeo Must Pie.
-Oh, yes!

1:24:23.125 --> 1:24:24.758
That's, that's like too good.

1:24:24.760 --> 1:24:26.727
Right, you see,
you see what I did there?

1:24:26.729 --> 1:24:28.695
-That's perfect!
-This is not Shakespeare,

1:24:28.697 --> 1:24:30.798
this is modern art.

1:24:30.800 --> 1:24:33.333
It's not Shakespeare,
none of this is Shakespeare.

1:24:33.335 --> 1:24:35.069
It is so Shakespeare.

1:24:35.071 --> 1:24:38.672
The story is the guy
going on fucking social media

1:24:38.674 --> 1:24:41.508
-dating apps, like Tinder--
-At a pie place!

1:24:41.510 --> 1:24:43.544
Romeo Must Pie!

1:24:43.546 --> 1:24:46.346
-Romeo Must Pie.
-What's goin' on, man?

1:24:46.348 --> 1:24:48.048
Everyone's--

1:24:48.049 --> 1:24:49.749
-Pie-rates of the Caribbean.
-It's not a high-concept idea,

1:24:49.752 --> 1:24:51.518
-this is low-concept idea,
the guy's just

1:24:51.520 --> 1:24:54.321
-tryin' to get laid.
-Pie-rates, American Pie!

1:24:54.323 --> 1:24:56.457
Oh, how come I didn't
think of that?

1:24:56.459 --> 1:24:58.158
(laughing)

1:24:58.160 --> 1:24:59.827
That's great.

1:24:59.829 --> 1:25:01.595
That was good.

1:25:01.597 --> 1:25:03.430
That was good.

1:25:03.432 --> 1:25:05.466
(laughing)

1:25:05.468 --> 1:25:15.442
¶

1:25:20.816 --> 1:25:24.418
¶ Post-modernism
took you by surprise

1:25:24.420 --> 1:25:26.687
