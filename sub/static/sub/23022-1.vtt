00:33.220 --> 00:36.250
'Twas the night
before Christmas,

00:36.290 --> 00:38.020
when all through the house,

00:38.060 --> 00:40.920
not a creature was stirring,

00:40.960 --> 00:42.990
not even a mouse.

00:43.030 --> 00:48.100
The stockings were hung
by the chimney with care,

00:48.130 --> 00:53.440
in hopes that Saint Nicholas
soon would be there.

00:53.470 --> 00:58.510
The children were nestled
all snug in their beds,

00:58.540 --> 01:02.340
while visions of sugarplums
danced in their heads.

01:04.819 --> 01:07.280
And Mama in her kerchief,

01:07.320 --> 01:09.720
and I in my cap,

01:09.750 --> 01:13.620
had just settled in
for a long winter's nap,

01:13.660 --> 01:16.620
when out on the lawn,
there arose such a clatter.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.530
Yes!

01:18.560 --> 01:22.430
I sprang from my bed
to see what was the matter.

01:24.330 --> 01:29.400
But I heard him exclaim
ere he drove out of sight,

01:29.440 --> 01:31.810
"Merry Christmas to all,

01:31.840 --> 01:34.740
and to all a good night!"

01:40.680 --> 01:42.120
Whoo!

01:51.960 --> 01:53.560
Take care.
Thank you so much.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.430
- Thank you.
- Good night.

02:05.810 --> 02:06.810
Mom?

02:06.840 --> 02:08.240
- Hm?
- Are you okay?

02:08.280 --> 02:09.840
Oh.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.250
Yeah. It's just, uh...

02:12.280 --> 02:14.780
I can't believe
that was the last time.

02:14.820 --> 02:16.250
Honey, we're only moving
out to Long Island.

02:16.290 --> 02:17.520
We can always come back
and visit.

02:17.550 --> 02:19.420
I know. It's just, uh...

02:19.460 --> 02:21.920
I never thought it'd be so hard
to leave this place.

02:21.960 --> 02:24.930
Are you guys sure
I can't convince you to stay?

02:25.900 --> 02:27.530
We talked about this.

02:27.560 --> 02:30.270
Your father and I
aren't getting any younger.

02:30.300 --> 02:33.030
And you, we couldn't ask
for anyone better

02:33.070 --> 02:35.100
to take our place here,
seriously.

02:35.140 --> 02:37.370
Honey, the customers love you,
the employees love you.

02:37.410 --> 02:38.870
You've always done
such a great job

02:38.910 --> 02:41.140
keeping the Christmas Eve
block party going.

02:41.180 --> 02:43.210
That is, assuming you
wanna keep the shop going.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.110
- Yeah.
- Are you kidding me?

02:45.150 --> 02:48.120
This store has been in
our family for over 40 years.

02:48.150 --> 02:50.390
This is practically
your life's work.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.650
Of course I wanna keep it going.

02:52.690 --> 02:55.820
Well, since that's the case,

02:55.860 --> 02:58.290
The Christmas Shop...

03:00.230 --> 03:01.400
is all yours.

03:02.770 --> 03:05.200
I'm gonna miss you guys!

03:05.240 --> 03:07.300
We're gonna
miss you too, sweetheart.

03:44.070 --> 03:45.810
Merry Christmas.

04:06.960 --> 04:09.030
No, I'm serious. Look,
you never know what you're--

04:09.070 --> 04:10.230
Yeah, okay.

04:10.270 --> 04:11.730
Oh! I'm so sorry.

04:11.770 --> 04:13.400
Sorry. Um, here.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.440
No.

04:15.470 --> 04:16.600
Here, after you.

04:16.640 --> 04:18.410
Please.

04:18.440 --> 04:21.380
Yeah, sorry.
Um, hang on. So...

04:23.010 --> 04:25.710
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I think we should, uh...

04:49.540 --> 04:51.670
Don't you just love
Christmas in New York?

04:51.710 --> 04:54.940
Someone woke up on the right
side of the Christmas tree.

04:58.010 --> 05:00.250
Good morning, Toby!

05:00.280 --> 05:02.120
Good morning to you too.

05:02.150 --> 05:03.650
- Someone spiked her eggnog.
- Hmm.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.860
Guys, this is my first day
running The Christmas Shop,

05:07.890 --> 05:10.120
and I am going to make it...

05:10.160 --> 05:12.690
our best season yet.

05:12.730 --> 05:14.100
Okay!

05:14.130 --> 05:17.100
So what are we gonna
work on first?

05:17.130 --> 05:19.100
What do you mean?

05:19.140 --> 05:20.870
It's like you said,
The Christmas Shop is yours.

05:20.900 --> 05:22.300
That means you can change
whatever you want.

05:22.340 --> 05:24.810
Guys, why would I
wanna change anything?

05:24.840 --> 05:27.010
People have been coming here
for 40 years.

05:27.040 --> 05:29.280
Generations have grown up
with this place.

05:29.310 --> 05:31.950
I think it's perfect
just the way it is.

05:31.980 --> 05:34.380
What are we gonna do about the
big Christmas Eve block party?

05:34.420 --> 05:36.950
I mean, your dad
always did the decorations,

05:36.990 --> 05:38.620
and your mom would always
read the crowd a story.

05:38.660 --> 05:41.790
Assuming people even come.
You know sales are down.

05:41.830 --> 05:44.190
Guys, we can handle it.

05:44.230 --> 05:45.890
Erika and I have been
practically running this place

05:45.930 --> 05:47.700
for years anyway.

05:47.730 --> 05:50.130
Come on, there's nothing
to worry about.

05:50.170 --> 05:52.970
Everything's going
to be just fine.

05:55.270 --> 05:56.700
Yeah, I'll look into that
for you.

05:56.740 --> 05:59.510
These figures in front of me
look promising.

05:59.540 --> 06:01.040
Yeah, okay.

06:01.080 --> 06:03.510
Oh, hey, yeah, yeah.
Let me call you back.

06:03.550 --> 06:05.810
All right, yeah. Helen!

06:05.850 --> 06:08.220
- What can I do for you?
- In case you haven't heard,

06:08.250 --> 06:10.690
there's this thing
called "Christmas."

06:10.720 --> 06:13.860
That sounds vaguely familiar.

06:13.890 --> 06:17.690
You sure? 'Cause I'm not seeing
any holiday spirit in here.

06:17.730 --> 06:20.760
Oh, well, I know, I know.
I just, I've been so, so busy.

06:20.800 --> 06:23.100
Yeah, come with me.
I wanna show you something.

06:23.130 --> 06:24.330
Yeah?

06:28.040 --> 06:29.300
Michael.

06:30.470 --> 06:33.170
Oh, is this the new development?

06:33.210 --> 06:35.210
Mm-hmm.

06:35.250 --> 06:39.550
50 stories, 90 units,
full concierge service,

06:39.580 --> 06:42.020
health and fitness spa,
three restaurants,

06:42.050 --> 06:44.220
and an organic supermarket.

06:44.250 --> 06:46.590
Broadway Towers.

06:46.620 --> 06:49.760
Think you can handle it?

06:49.790 --> 06:51.860
I thought Dunbar
was overseeing this.

06:51.900 --> 06:53.460
He gave notice this morning.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.200
He's going over to Weddington.

06:55.230 --> 06:57.600
Wow.

06:57.630 --> 06:59.800
Rich and Chris are still
stuck on this downtown project.

06:59.840 --> 07:02.640
I honestly don't have
anybody else available.

07:02.670 --> 07:05.710
Look, if it's gonna
be too much work,

07:05.740 --> 07:06.870
I mean, we could outsource--

07:06.910 --> 07:09.810
No, no, no, I--
I can handle it.

07:09.850 --> 07:10.910
You sure?

07:10.950 --> 07:13.550
Absolutely, yeah, yeah.

07:13.580 --> 07:17.050
Great. You don't have plans
for Christmas, do you?

07:19.090 --> 07:21.120
Of course you don't.

07:21.160 --> 07:23.260
The way your office looks,
I wouldn't be surprised

07:23.290 --> 07:26.060
if you got visited by
three ghosts on Christmas Eve.

07:26.100 --> 07:28.000
You know.

07:28.030 --> 07:31.630
<i> A Christmas Carol.</i>
Yeah, I get it.

07:31.670 --> 07:34.740
Hey, if you were gonna
take some time off,

07:34.770 --> 07:36.440
take it now.

07:36.470 --> 07:39.440
Find somebody special
to celebrate

07:39.480 --> 07:42.480
before things
get crazy around here.

07:51.050 --> 07:52.850
Thank you for shopping
The Christmas Shop

07:52.890 --> 07:55.790
- and have a merry day.
- Thanks.

07:55.830 --> 07:56.860
Hey, Chuck.

07:56.890 --> 07:59.130
So the folks finally retired.

07:59.160 --> 08:01.000
Yes, but don't you worry.

08:01.030 --> 08:03.800
We are not going anywhere.

08:03.830 --> 08:04.870
Oh.

08:04.900 --> 08:06.830
This is for Parker.

08:06.870 --> 08:08.440
- Aw.
- I know how much he loves them.

08:08.470 --> 08:10.340
I'll see you tomorrow,
Stephanie.

08:10.370 --> 08:12.710
Is there anything for me?
I'm expecting a package.

08:12.740 --> 08:14.180
You shipped it here?

08:14.210 --> 08:16.510
Yeah. My roommate
opens my mail.

08:16.550 --> 08:18.180
Hmm. It's from our landlord.

08:18.210 --> 08:20.180
Uh-oh. You're running
the place one day,

08:20.220 --> 08:24.050
and they're already
raising the rent?

08:24.090 --> 08:27.890
Actually,
they're kicking us out.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.390
Ha ha. Very funny.

08:29.430 --> 08:32.860
I'm serious.
It's a 30-day notice.

08:32.900 --> 08:34.530
It says the trust
sold the building,

08:34.559 --> 08:36.860
and the buyer isn't renewing
any of the leases.

08:36.900 --> 08:38.030
Let me see that.

08:41.539 --> 08:43.169
She's not kidding.

08:43.210 --> 08:46.740
It says our last day's
December 31st.

08:46.780 --> 08:48.980
- Did you get one too?
- Mm-hmm.

08:49.010 --> 08:50.510
They can't do that, can they?

08:50.550 --> 08:51.850
Just kick you guys
out like that?

08:51.880 --> 08:53.650
Well, we're month-to-month,

08:53.680 --> 08:55.250
so as long as they give
a 30-day notice,

08:55.290 --> 08:57.320
they can technically
do whatever they want.

08:57.350 --> 08:59.220
This is my daughter's
favorite store.

08:59.260 --> 09:00.390
She's gonna be heartbroken.

09:00.420 --> 09:02.390
Well, what about Patty Cakes?

09:02.430 --> 09:05.030
You can get coffee
and cupcakes anywhere,

09:05.060 --> 09:07.900
but this place,
it's one-of-a-kind.

09:07.930 --> 09:09.900
Where would you start over
with a shop like this?

09:09.930 --> 09:14.670
Okay, guys, do me a favor
and don't tell my parents, okay?

09:14.700 --> 09:17.510
I wanna be the one to call them.

09:17.540 --> 09:19.340
Eventually.

09:24.250 --> 09:27.420
A toast to my kid brother,

09:27.450 --> 09:29.350
improving the city
one building at a time.

09:29.390 --> 09:31.750
How about we see if I actually
pull it off first?

09:31.790 --> 09:33.590
Will you look at that?
A New York real estate mogul

09:33.620 --> 09:35.560
who's actually humble.

09:35.590 --> 09:37.860
Dad would be proud.

09:37.890 --> 09:39.430
Yeah.

09:39.460 --> 09:41.260
I know it's not Christmas yet,

09:41.300 --> 09:43.600
but we got you something.

09:43.630 --> 09:47.100
Aw, you guys.
Well, I didn't get you anything.

09:47.140 --> 09:48.470
That's all right.
Like she said,

09:48.500 --> 09:50.470
it's not Christmas yet.

09:50.510 --> 09:51.770
Stop it!

09:51.810 --> 09:53.770
- Ah, okay.
- This guy.

09:53.810 --> 09:55.740
Here you go.

09:55.780 --> 09:58.110
Thank you.

10:02.290 --> 10:04.320
Hey, wow!

10:04.350 --> 10:06.420
Whoa! First edition?

10:06.460 --> 10:07.720
Where'd you find this?

10:07.760 --> 10:09.790
A thrift shop in the Village.

10:09.830 --> 10:12.660
Since we couldn't get you
what you really needed,

10:12.700 --> 10:14.330
it's the next best thing.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.560
What is it that I really need?

10:16.600 --> 10:18.170
Doesn't it bother you?

10:18.200 --> 10:21.240
You work all the time,
and you have no social life.

10:21.270 --> 10:23.470
Mike, when was
the last time that you,

10:23.510 --> 10:26.670
you know, took a little time
for yourself?

10:26.710 --> 10:31.450
I appreciate your concern, I do,
but I'm fine, really.

10:31.480 --> 10:34.250
I have someone
that I want you to meet.

10:34.280 --> 10:36.180
- Julia...
- We went to Columbia together.

10:36.220 --> 10:38.150
She's 33, she's lovely,

10:38.190 --> 10:40.960
and she's a lawyer
at a midtown firm.

10:42.890 --> 10:45.260
Just promise me
that you'll e-mail her.

10:45.290 --> 10:47.930
I appreciate the gesture.

10:47.960 --> 10:51.200
I do, really, but I'm fine.

10:51.230 --> 10:52.870
Really.

10:52.900 --> 10:54.400
Oh.

10:56.070 --> 10:59.970
Oh, um, it's the sitter.
Excuse me.

11:00.010 --> 11:03.540
Come on. Work is going great,
you're making decent money.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.850
Don't you think it's time
to start thinking about

11:05.880 --> 11:07.980
settling down,
having a kid of your own?

11:08.020 --> 11:10.020
And give up being Uncle Mike?

11:10.050 --> 11:11.350
Not a chance.

11:11.390 --> 11:13.150
Come on, let's eat.

11:34.280 --> 11:35.380
Hmm.

12:02.870 --> 12:05.570
- Hello.
- Oh, hey.

12:05.610 --> 12:07.680
You just caught me.
I was about to--

12:07.710 --> 12:09.280
I've seen you before.

12:09.310 --> 12:11.880
I don't think so.

12:11.910 --> 12:14.480
At the coffee shop
downstairs, right?

12:15.620 --> 12:18.220
- Oh! Right! Yes, hi!
- Hi.

12:18.250 --> 12:20.220
Can I help you find something?

12:20.260 --> 12:23.560
Well, actually, I'm looking
for a Christmas decoration.

12:23.590 --> 12:25.430
Not really sure if
I'm in the right place though.

12:25.460 --> 12:26.630
Hmm.

12:26.660 --> 12:29.300
I think we might
have a few left.

12:33.100 --> 12:35.870
So are you looking
for anything in particular?

12:35.910 --> 12:38.470
Well, something small.
I haven't had a lot of time

12:38.510 --> 12:40.610
to get out this year
and find anything.

12:40.640 --> 12:42.240
My mother always said
the best ornaments

12:42.280 --> 12:44.880
were the ones
that say something.

12:44.910 --> 12:49.650
Well, how about a snowman
playing the guitar?

12:49.690 --> 12:51.620
- Oh, you like him, huh?
- I do.

12:51.650 --> 12:53.120
Check it out.

12:55.290 --> 12:58.790
<i> ♪♪ </i>

13:00.300 --> 13:02.560
Sounds like his guitar
is out of tune though.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.430
Well, to be fair,
it's kinda hard to play

13:04.470 --> 13:05.830
when your arms
are made of twigs.

13:05.870 --> 13:07.540
Touché.

13:10.110 --> 13:13.140
Wow, this is, um...

13:13.180 --> 13:15.140
this is some place
you got here.

13:15.180 --> 13:18.850
Yeah, well, take a good look
while you can.

13:18.880 --> 13:20.920
You going out of business?

13:20.950 --> 13:22.580
They sold the building,

13:22.620 --> 13:24.590
and they're kicking us out
at the end of the month.

13:24.620 --> 13:26.490
- Well, that's a shame.
- Yeah.

13:26.520 --> 13:29.920
Tell that to the Scrooges
who are kicking us out.

13:29.960 --> 13:32.690
And with business being so slow,
we can't really afford to move.

13:32.730 --> 13:34.360
Well, maybe I could help.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.530
Do you have any experience
in Christmas miracles?

13:36.570 --> 13:39.170
No, but I do have a little
experience in real estate.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.970
I'd be happy to give you
some advice.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.800
I mean, if you want.

13:43.840 --> 13:46.470
- Some advice?
- Yeah, well...

13:46.510 --> 13:48.040
assuming that you've been
a good tenant,

13:48.080 --> 13:50.440
which I'm sure that you have,

13:50.480 --> 13:53.450
I think they could get you
at least a relocation cost.

13:53.480 --> 13:56.150
Hmm, interesting.

13:56.190 --> 13:59.350
Of course, you could
always just fight it.

13:59.390 --> 14:03.290
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna look at a few things,

14:03.330 --> 14:05.290
and I'll give you
a call tomorrow.

14:05.330 --> 14:06.530
If you want.

14:08.500 --> 14:09.960
Stephanie Nichol.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.570
It's really nice to meet you,
Stephanie.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.070
I'm Michael.

14:13.100 --> 14:14.470
I'm gonna take this little guy

14:14.500 --> 14:16.670
'cause he's got soul.

14:16.710 --> 14:18.310
Great choice.

14:30.520 --> 14:34.890

What are you working on?

15:49.130 --> 15:53.300
I'm just looking something up
for a friend.

15:53.340 --> 15:55.870
Take a walk with me.

16:04.510 --> 16:05.510
Morning!

16:05.550 --> 16:07.980
Good morning, Erika.

16:08.020 --> 16:09.350
Late night?

16:09.390 --> 16:11.590
I was looking
for spaces for rent.

16:11.620 --> 16:13.920
- And?
- I don't suppose you have any

16:13.960 --> 16:15.790
rich uncles
I don't know about.

16:15.830 --> 16:17.990
I gotta tell you,
my mom is not gonna be happy

16:18.030 --> 16:19.360
with me moving back in
with her.

16:19.400 --> 16:20.960
We have 30 days
to figure this out.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.200
We can do this. We can.

16:23.230 --> 16:25.500
Yeah.

16:25.530 --> 16:28.500
I know you're
the optimistic one.

16:28.540 --> 16:30.470
That's what everyone
likes about you.

16:30.510 --> 16:32.110
But it's not like someone's
just gonna walk in the door

16:32.140 --> 16:34.640
and tell us how
to save the store.

16:34.680 --> 16:37.180
- Well...
- Did someone walk in the door

16:37.210 --> 16:38.810
and tell you
how to save the store?

16:38.850 --> 16:40.210
All he said was that
he was in real estate,

16:40.250 --> 16:43.120
and he might be able to help.

16:43.150 --> 16:44.550
But it might be nothing.

16:44.590 --> 16:47.390
Nothing?
Stephanie, think about it.

16:47.420 --> 16:49.120
The day you find out
you're getting evicted,

16:49.160 --> 16:52.830
someone just happens to show up
and offers you a way out.

16:52.860 --> 16:54.800
It's like a fairy tale.

16:54.830 --> 16:57.030
Okay, what if I am not looking

16:57.070 --> 16:59.030
for my Prince Charming
right now?

16:59.070 --> 17:00.530
When are you gonna learn
there's more to life

17:00.570 --> 17:02.240
than just eating frozen pizza
at home alone?

17:02.270 --> 17:03.640
And what if I like frozen pizza?

17:03.670 --> 17:06.069
All I'm saying is
open your mind.

17:06.109 --> 17:07.839
Sometimes change is good.

17:13.079 --> 17:15.250
What are we doing here?

17:15.280 --> 17:17.250
You are so terrible
at surprises.

17:17.290 --> 17:19.990
You must've been a real pistol
at Christmastime.

17:21.760 --> 17:25.290
I give you Broadway Towers.

17:26.400 --> 17:28.030
Wait, you bought <i> this</i> building?

17:28.060 --> 17:29.500
- Mm-hmm.
- Trolley Square?

17:29.530 --> 17:32.200
Isn't it great?
The location is perfect.

17:32.230 --> 17:35.070
I mean, it's near the subway.
Park's two blocks that way.

17:35.100 --> 17:37.570
What about the tenants?

17:37.610 --> 17:39.010
Well, you don't have
to worry about them.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.340
They'll be out
by the end of the month.

17:50.750 --> 17:53.590
It's him.

17:53.620 --> 17:55.320
Prince Charming?

17:57.790 --> 17:59.390
So if everybody
gets out by the 31st,

17:59.430 --> 18:01.530
I mean, we can break ground
the first of January.

18:01.560 --> 18:04.100
- Michael!
- Hi, Stephanie.

18:04.130 --> 18:06.200
Break ground for what?

18:06.240 --> 18:09.140
A state-of-the-art
residential complex

18:09.170 --> 18:11.210
and shopping center.

18:11.240 --> 18:12.710
And you are?

18:12.740 --> 18:14.780
Stephanie Nichol.

18:14.810 --> 18:15.780
Helen.

18:15.810 --> 18:18.050
Do you two know--

18:18.080 --> 18:20.650
Michael, are you okay?
You look sick.

18:20.680 --> 18:23.720
Michael, I don't understand.

18:25.250 --> 18:27.420
I'm the Scrooge
that's kicking you out.

18:31.990 --> 18:33.930
A little experience
in real estate?

18:33.960 --> 18:36.530
- I told you, I didn't know.
- And you just wander in.

18:36.570 --> 18:38.630
I was looking
for Christmas decorations.

18:38.670 --> 18:40.530
I'm such an idiot.

18:40.570 --> 18:43.100
Nobody's saying that you have
to close the store forever.

18:43.140 --> 18:45.370
There's plenty of
opportunities in the city

18:45.410 --> 18:46.970
for places like this.

18:47.010 --> 18:49.540
You think I didn't look?
Without rent control,

18:49.580 --> 18:51.180
we don't have
a lot of options.

18:51.210 --> 18:52.680
Well, maybe I can help
you find something.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.550
You know what?
Why do I have to move?

18:54.580 --> 18:56.680
Why don't you find
a new place?

18:56.720 --> 18:58.950
You said yourself there's plenty
of opportunities in the city.

18:58.990 --> 19:01.120
Stephanie, this is
a billion-dollar development.

19:01.160 --> 19:03.120
They're not just gonna
pick up and move because--

19:03.160 --> 19:06.330
Why? Because of a little shop
like this?

19:06.360 --> 19:09.230
Last night, you told me
I should fight.

19:09.270 --> 19:10.500
That was before.

19:10.530 --> 19:13.300
Before you knew it was you.

19:13.340 --> 19:14.430
Yeah.

19:17.110 --> 19:18.740
Best I can do, I can talk
to my boss about this,

19:18.770 --> 19:20.840
but I'm not making
any promises.

19:20.880 --> 19:24.650
Okay, well,
I won't hold my breath.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.680
Let's get back to work.

19:33.690 --> 19:36.560
I can be back in the office
in 30 minutes.

20:31.310 --> 20:32.910
Hey, guys.

20:32.950 --> 20:34.950
How's the new place?

20:34.980 --> 20:37.550
Oh, so far so good.

20:37.590 --> 20:39.990
We're still unpacking.
Your father is a pack rat.

20:40.020 --> 20:41.720
Hey, I'm standing right here.

20:41.760 --> 20:44.220
So how's everything
with the shop?

20:44.260 --> 20:48.460
Um, the shop is, uh, great.

20:48.500 --> 20:50.800
You actually brought this?

20:50.830 --> 20:52.630
It's my favorite hat.

20:52.670 --> 20:54.270
I'll buy you a new one.

20:54.300 --> 20:56.640
You sound stressed out.

20:58.040 --> 21:00.010
Mom, everything's fine.

21:00.040 --> 21:01.680
<i> Are you eating okay?</i>

21:01.710 --> 21:05.110
I could have Patty bring you
some of her rugelach.

21:05.150 --> 21:08.020
It's just been a busy day,
that's all.

21:08.050 --> 21:10.620
You're sure
there's nothing I can do?

21:10.650 --> 21:14.690
<i> Mom, everything is okay.</i>
<i> I'll call you later, okay?</i>

21:14.720 --> 21:16.260
Sure. Love you, sweetheart.

21:31.640 --> 21:33.740
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

21:35.740 --> 21:37.010
Stephanie!

21:37.050 --> 21:39.550
Oh, hey, Amelia.

21:39.580 --> 21:40.850
Are you going
to take my order today?

21:40.880 --> 21:42.380
- Uh-huh.
- In that case,

21:42.420 --> 21:44.650
I will have the usual.

21:44.690 --> 21:45.720
Coming right up.

21:45.750 --> 21:47.290
Thank you.

21:47.320 --> 21:50.120
- Hey, what did she say?
- The usual.

21:53.660 --> 21:55.500
I'll get that.

21:55.530 --> 21:57.960
Don't you have eviction notices
to be serving up or something?

21:58.000 --> 21:59.500
I'll tell you what.

21:59.540 --> 22:02.200
I have a table over there
with an empty chair.

22:02.240 --> 22:06.070
Now if you wanna take a moment
and chat, it's yours.

22:06.110 --> 22:09.140
If not, it's really nice
to see you again,

22:09.180 --> 22:12.680
and I hope to see you
around, okay?

22:12.720 --> 22:14.050
Yep.

22:17.790 --> 22:21.050
It's the good-looking ones
you have to worry about.

22:21.090 --> 22:22.860
Ugh! Yeah, right?

22:22.890 --> 22:25.260
- Talk to him.
- What?

22:25.290 --> 22:27.030
You know what they say.

22:27.060 --> 22:29.430
Yeah, that no good deed
goes unpunished?

22:29.470 --> 22:32.230
Keep your enemies closer.

22:32.270 --> 22:34.500
Bah humbug.

22:37.710 --> 22:39.610
Gingerbread muffin?

22:39.640 --> 22:43.010
I thought Christmas
wasn't your thing.

22:43.050 --> 22:45.510
I don't have anything
against Christmas.

22:45.550 --> 22:47.050
I'm just busy.

22:47.080 --> 22:48.920
I really wanna help you.

22:48.950 --> 22:51.120
This place will have
to close too, you know.

22:51.150 --> 22:53.450
And the flower shop
across the way.

22:53.490 --> 22:55.960
Did you know the Blooms invested
their entire life savings

22:55.990 --> 22:57.390
into that place?

22:57.430 --> 23:00.960
Wait. Their last name
is actually Bloom?

23:01.000 --> 23:03.360
Stephanie, look around.
It's dead here.

23:03.400 --> 23:06.900
I suppose you and your boss
want to turn it into a juice bar

23:06.940 --> 23:08.270
or a yoga studio.

23:08.300 --> 23:09.470
You're taking this personally.

23:09.510 --> 23:11.140
It is personal.

23:11.170 --> 23:14.140
My parents worked so hard
for that place. 40 years.

23:14.180 --> 23:17.410
I'm sure that they'll understand
that it's not your fault.

23:17.450 --> 23:19.410
Says a guy who's probably never
had to worry about anything

23:19.450 --> 23:21.110
a day in his life.

23:21.150 --> 23:22.580
You think I just
woke up one day

23:22.620 --> 23:24.380
and decided
I wanted to do this?

23:24.420 --> 23:27.590
That's just the sad part.
Maybe it is just a job for you.

23:27.620 --> 23:31.090
But I've spent practically
my entire life in that shop,

23:31.130 --> 23:33.060
and if you just spent
a little time there,

23:33.100 --> 23:35.560
you would see
how special it was too.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.830
I don't need to hang out
in your shop

23:37.870 --> 23:40.930
to see how much
it means to you.

23:40.970 --> 23:46.940
No, but maybe you'd find
it means something to you.

23:49.610 --> 23:51.780
I'm gonna need you down there
on site anyway,

23:51.810 --> 23:55.120
meeting with the architects,
contractors, inspectors.

23:55.150 --> 23:57.080
You know,
and if your being there

23:57.120 --> 24:00.350
makes her feel more comfortable
about this transition,

24:00.390 --> 24:01.620
then what's the harm?

24:01.660 --> 24:03.420
Because I feel bad.

24:03.460 --> 24:05.860
She already told me that
the store can't afford to move.

24:05.890 --> 24:09.300
I can't be concerned with
the well-being of every tenant.

24:09.330 --> 24:11.160
I know.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.530
All I'm saying is that
with everything going on,

24:13.570 --> 24:17.100
it might just be easier
if you were down there on site.

24:17.140 --> 24:20.310
I'll think about it, okay?

24:21.680 --> 24:25.180
Don't forget your snowman.

24:25.210 --> 24:27.780
We wouldn't want him
to get lonely now, would we?

24:41.160 --> 24:45.000
Don't look now, but your
Prince Charming is back.

24:53.410 --> 24:55.310
Michael.

24:55.340 --> 24:57.080
What are you doing here?

24:57.110 --> 24:59.580
Well, someone told me
if I spent a little time here,

24:59.620 --> 25:01.680
I'd see how special
this place really is.

25:01.720 --> 25:04.550
Luckily for me, I have to
spend a lot of time here

25:04.590 --> 25:07.590
getting this project
off the ground.

25:07.620 --> 25:11.020
Well, in that case,
welcome to The Christmas Shop.

25:18.970 --> 25:21.100
You set this all up yourself?

25:21.140 --> 25:22.900
It's a work in progress.

25:22.940 --> 25:26.440
And in this corner,
we have our very own North Pole.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.340
Does he sing too?

25:28.380 --> 25:29.940
Funny.

25:29.980 --> 25:33.350
And then right over here
is our holiday row.

25:33.380 --> 25:35.950
This is where we keep
all of our themed ornaments.

25:35.980 --> 25:40.020
We have a Fourth of July tree,
a Halloween tree.

25:40.060 --> 25:43.220
- An Easter tree?
- We're a year-round store.

25:43.260 --> 25:45.060
You should've seen
our haunted house in October.

25:45.090 --> 25:47.360
Oh, I can imagine.

25:47.400 --> 25:49.030
Block party, huh?

25:49.060 --> 25:50.600
The biggest and best
holiday block party

25:50.630 --> 25:52.400
in our neighborhood.

25:52.430 --> 25:55.100
We do it every Christmas Eve,
right here behind the building.

25:55.140 --> 25:56.970
Cute.

25:57.010 --> 25:59.410
I never would've imagined that
there was enough Christmas stuff

25:59.440 --> 26:01.070
to, uh, you know.

26:01.110 --> 26:03.540
Fill an entire store?

26:03.580 --> 26:06.310
Anything and everything you need
for the holiday spirit.

26:06.350 --> 26:08.320
That's what my mom used to say.

26:08.350 --> 26:10.050
I'm curious about one thing.

26:10.090 --> 26:13.050
Why didn't your parents
ever decide to modernize?

26:13.090 --> 26:14.990
What do you mean?

26:15.020 --> 26:17.920
Well, I'm not saying that
you have to change everything.

26:17.960 --> 26:21.130
It's just, you know,
little updates here and there.

26:21.160 --> 26:23.300
If it ain't broke,
don't fix it.

26:23.330 --> 26:25.500
Stephanie,
your register's ancient,

26:25.530 --> 26:27.930
you have handwritten
price tags,

26:27.970 --> 26:29.240
and you got a staff of,
what, two?

26:29.270 --> 26:31.770
How do you even process
online orders?

26:31.810 --> 26:34.510
Do you even have a website?

26:34.540 --> 26:37.180
- Seriously?
- Everybody's got a website.

26:37.210 --> 26:39.180
The Christmas Shop
is meant to be an experience.

26:39.210 --> 26:42.080
When you walk in here,
it's not just another shop.

26:42.120 --> 26:44.750
It's the lights
and the music and the...

26:44.790 --> 26:46.450
Animated Santa Claus.

26:47.820 --> 26:50.120
Okay, turn around
and close your eyes.

26:50.160 --> 26:52.030
Right now?

26:52.060 --> 26:53.460
I won't bite.

26:53.500 --> 26:55.630
All right, now what?

26:55.660 --> 26:57.960
Take a deep breath.

27:00.070 --> 27:02.040
Smell that?

27:02.070 --> 27:03.200
I, uh... Oh, wait.

27:05.070 --> 27:06.340
- Is that pine?
- Mm-hmm.

27:06.380 --> 27:08.210
- Cinnamon.
- Mm-hmm.

27:08.240 --> 27:10.080
Is that apple?

27:11.150 --> 27:13.080
It's Christmas.

27:16.520 --> 27:18.550
I, yeah, uh...

27:18.590 --> 27:21.290
I have a contractor's meeting
in five minutes downstairs,

27:21.320 --> 27:22.290
- so, uh...
- Okay.

27:22.320 --> 27:24.690
I'm gonna go to work.

27:42.380 --> 27:45.350

28:34.630 --> 28:37.000
- Thank you.
- Of course, yeah.

28:47.140 --> 28:49.510
Yeah, she's old-fashioned.

28:49.540 --> 28:54.510
She just likes nostalgia.
There's nothing wrong with that.

28:54.550 --> 28:57.520
You have to admit, your parents
were a little old school.

28:57.550 --> 28:59.450
Isn't that part of the appeal?

28:59.490 --> 29:01.520
Why does everything
have to change?

29:01.560 --> 29:03.590
You like her.

29:03.630 --> 29:05.590
No, it's just business, man.

29:05.630 --> 29:07.760
I don't actually
work at the store.

29:07.800 --> 29:11.230
I just have a lot of
on-site meetings, you know?

29:11.270 --> 29:12.900
Seeing him with those
inspectors and everything,

29:12.930 --> 29:15.540
it was like he couldn't wait
to tear the place down.

29:15.570 --> 29:17.100
He's just doing his job.

29:17.140 --> 29:18.570
Maybe if he wasn't
trying to destroy

29:18.610 --> 29:21.040
everything my parents
worked so hard for,

29:21.080 --> 29:22.780
I would think about it.

29:22.810 --> 29:25.250
So you're telling me
that if all things were equal,

29:25.280 --> 29:26.580
you still wouldn't
go out with her?

29:26.620 --> 29:27.950
What's it matter?

29:27.980 --> 29:29.380
At the end of the month,
it'll be closed,

29:29.420 --> 29:32.550
and Helen will have
her big new skyscraper.

29:34.020 --> 29:35.920
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

29:35.960 --> 29:38.890
I'm not really looking for
someone in my life right now.

29:38.930 --> 29:41.390
I meant the store.

29:41.430 --> 29:43.430
Oh, right.

29:43.470 --> 29:47.400
You still have that reporter
friend over at the <i> Sentinel.</i>

29:47.440 --> 29:48.540
I have an idea.

30:02.550 --> 30:05.020
Michael, could you...

30:05.050 --> 30:06.150
Oh, sure.

30:06.190 --> 30:08.090
- Thanks.
- Of course.

30:08.120 --> 30:10.190
I got you, bro.
Here you go.

30:10.230 --> 30:12.560
All right, have a good one.

30:12.590 --> 30:14.130
Thanks.

30:17.500 --> 30:20.530
- Bye. Thanks for coming.
- Bye. Thanks.

30:20.570 --> 30:22.240
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:22.270 --> 30:24.200
That is not how we say that.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.470
- Say what?
- Repeat after me.

30:26.510 --> 30:28.540
Thank you for shopping
at The Christmas Shop.

30:28.580 --> 30:30.580
Have a merry day.

30:30.610 --> 30:33.550
Come on, just try it.

30:33.580 --> 30:35.820
Thank you for shopping
at The Christmas Shop.

30:35.850 --> 30:38.180
Thank you for shopping
at The Christmas Shop.

30:38.220 --> 30:40.220
Have a merry day.

30:40.260 --> 30:42.720
Have a merry day.

30:42.760 --> 30:44.860
That's sort of what
you're going for, right?

30:44.890 --> 30:46.430
Somewhere in there?
You hate it.

30:46.460 --> 30:48.490
Yeah. Um, hmm.

30:48.530 --> 30:51.900
Watch a master at work.

30:51.930 --> 30:55.030
Welcome to The Christmas Shop.
How may I help you?

30:55.070 --> 30:56.770
I am Allie Hadley
with the <i> New York Sentinel,</i>

30:56.810 --> 30:58.540
and I am looking for Stephanie,

30:58.570 --> 31:00.570
regarding a potential article
about The Christmas Shop.

31:00.610 --> 31:03.510
- Oh, yes, I'm Stephanie.
- Oh, hi, wow.

31:03.550 --> 31:08.280
You were not kidding.
This place is really cute.

31:08.320 --> 31:09.850
You said you work
for the <i> Sentinel?</i>

31:09.890 --> 31:11.720
Yeah, hi, Allie.
You work here too?

31:11.750 --> 31:13.750
Interesting story about that.

31:13.790 --> 31:16.460
Michael Kilpatrick.
I work for MacLaine Properties.

31:16.490 --> 31:19.390
You guys don't mind
if I record this, right?

31:39.750 --> 31:42.620
How about that one
right there?

31:42.650 --> 31:45.490
It's called
The Christmas Shop. Yeah!

31:45.520 --> 31:47.990
All in different colors.

31:48.020 --> 31:50.620
Really pick whatever you want.
Thanks.

31:50.660 --> 31:52.260
What is going on?

31:52.290 --> 31:53.830
The <i> Sentinel</i> printed
a story about the shop

31:53.860 --> 31:55.330
on the front of
their Life section.

31:55.360 --> 31:56.930
Thank you for shopping
at The Christmas Shop.

31:56.970 --> 31:59.070
Have a merry day!

31:59.100 --> 32:01.430
Get a load of this!
Isn't it incredible?

32:01.470 --> 32:03.970
Actually,
it's a Christmas miracle.

32:06.540 --> 32:08.310
It seems like
the Upper West Side

32:08.340 --> 32:11.480
might get coal in their
proverbial stocking this year,

32:11.510 --> 32:14.510
in yet another example
of a well-connected developer

32:14.550 --> 32:17.150
forcing out a quaint
mom-and-pop shop.

32:17.190 --> 32:19.450
I'm just trying to
enhance the neighborhood.

32:19.490 --> 32:20.620
I don't need
this kind of publicity.

32:20.660 --> 32:22.290
I warned you.

32:22.320 --> 32:24.760
This Christmas Shop is really
important to Stephanie.

32:24.790 --> 32:27.630
She's not going down
without a fight.

32:27.660 --> 32:29.430
Clearly.

32:29.460 --> 32:33.200
Maybe there's something that
we can do to let her stay.

32:33.230 --> 32:34.970
It's just one store.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.940
If we don't break ground
on schedule,

32:37.970 --> 32:40.440
the financiers
lose their patience.

32:40.480 --> 32:42.610
And if the financiers
lose their patience,

32:42.640 --> 32:44.640
the entire deal falls apart.

32:44.680 --> 32:46.050
So no, Michael, I'm sorry.

32:46.080 --> 32:49.680
The Polar Express
has left the station.

33:01.160 --> 33:03.360
<i>People have been</i>
<i> coming from all over the city</i>

33:03.400 --> 33:05.500
<i> to finally experience</i>
<i> that holiday magic.</i>

33:05.530 --> 33:07.370
<i> The shop is now run</i>
<i> by Stephanie Nichol,</i>

33:07.400 --> 33:10.000

<i> Just because something's</i>
<i> been around for a while,</i>

33:12.570 --> 33:14.740
<i> doesn't mean</i>
<i> it needs to be replaced.</i>

33:14.780 --> 33:16.480
<i> And it's so important to me</i>

33:16.510 --> 33:18.340
<i> that the people of this</i>

33:18.380 --> 33:20.050

33:20.080 --> 33:22.750
<i> where they feel Christmas</i>
<i> spirit in their hearts.</i>

33:22.780 --> 33:25.250
That's not bad, huh?

33:25.290 --> 33:28.250
<i>While no one can say</i>

33:28.290 --> 33:31.020

33:31.060 --> 33:34.230
<i> - who takes the time to visit.</i>

33:36.430 --> 33:39.170
- Hey, Mom.
<i> - Ellen Peterson called to say</i>

33:39.200 --> 33:41.730
that she heard from Susan Larson
that Lilian Bland said

33:41.770 --> 33:43.940
that they sold the building?

33:43.970 --> 33:46.910
Mom, I am so sorry.

33:46.940 --> 33:49.280
<i> I just didn't</i>
<i> wanna worry you.</i>

33:49.310 --> 33:50.940
Well, of course
I'm gonna worry.

33:50.980 --> 33:52.450
I'm your mother.

33:52.480 --> 33:54.110
You're my responsibility.

33:54.150 --> 33:57.220
<i> I'll figure something out</i>
<i> somehow.</i>

33:57.250 --> 33:59.750
Is this even food?
Why can't I order the bacon?

33:59.790 --> 34:01.690
Remember your last checkup?

34:01.720 --> 34:04.260
Dr. Stein said you have
to watch your cholesterol.

34:04.290 --> 34:06.230
<i> You should see the attention</i>
<i> the shop has got</i>

34:06.260 --> 34:07.930
<i> since the story went viral.</i>

34:07.960 --> 34:10.260
If I could just change his mind.

34:10.300 --> 34:12.630
Whose mind?

34:12.670 --> 34:14.469
<i> Uh, it's, it's not important.</i>

34:14.500 --> 34:17.040
Steph, what have you
gotten yourself into?

34:18.510 --> 34:19.940
<i> Just let me call you</i>
<i> in a few days.</i>

34:19.969 --> 34:21.610
<i> Everything is</i>
<i> gonna be just fine.</i>

34:21.639 --> 34:25.810
Okay, sweetheart.
I love you. Bye.

34:25.850 --> 34:27.150
Daniel Martin Nichol!

34:27.179 --> 34:29.380
You put that back
right this second!

34:42.730 --> 34:45.199
We brought cupcakes!

34:46.230 --> 34:48.730
Ah, cinnamon swirl!

34:48.770 --> 34:50.469
You didn't have to do that.

34:50.510 --> 34:52.440
Speak for yourself.

34:52.469 --> 34:55.070
Mommy, can I go see
the reindeer?

34:55.110 --> 34:56.580
Sure.

34:56.610 --> 34:59.210
All the press your store
has gotten

34:59.250 --> 35:01.610
- has been great for business.
- Really?

35:01.650 --> 35:04.080
You don't think it might
turn things around, do you?

35:04.120 --> 35:05.120
I don't know.

35:05.150 --> 35:08.620
But I wanted to tell you,

35:08.660 --> 35:10.620
we found a new location.

35:10.660 --> 35:12.830
Really?

35:12.860 --> 35:14.490
Over on 84th.

35:14.530 --> 35:17.230
It's smaller,
but it's got a great kitchen.

35:17.270 --> 35:19.970
We were planning to move
after the block party.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.740
The Blooms found a place too.

35:22.770 --> 35:24.140
Oh.

35:24.170 --> 35:25.940
What about you guys?

35:25.970 --> 35:29.340
- Well, um--
- Stephanie...

35:29.380 --> 35:32.150
you're not actually trying
to fight them, are you?

35:32.180 --> 35:34.880
No, no,
of course not, I...

35:39.350 --> 35:41.590
I better get going.

35:46.230 --> 35:48.830
I didn't think you had
any meetings today.

35:48.860 --> 35:51.030
Oh, I saw you on TV
this morning.

35:51.070 --> 35:54.030
Oh, well, I just wanted
people to appreciate

35:54.070 --> 35:56.000
a good old-fashioned Christmas.

35:56.040 --> 35:57.600
I thought you were terrific.

35:57.640 --> 35:59.340
Really?

35:59.370 --> 36:01.010
You made me wanna run out
and buy an ornament right now.

36:01.040 --> 36:03.580
Well, what's stopping you?

36:06.410 --> 36:10.050
Look, since you're already here,
and you don't have any meetings,

36:10.080 --> 36:12.290
do you wanna lend a hand?

36:13.920 --> 36:15.250
Why not?

36:18.390 --> 36:20.360
Patty came by this morning.

36:20.400 --> 36:22.200
Oh?

36:22.230 --> 36:24.660
Said she found a place.

36:24.700 --> 36:26.870
The Blooms too.

36:26.900 --> 36:28.330
Really?

36:28.370 --> 36:30.370
You didn't know?

36:30.410 --> 36:33.070
Actually, I didn't.

36:33.110 --> 36:35.410
But it must make you happy,
right?

36:35.440 --> 36:36.980
I mean, you're winning.

36:39.410 --> 36:41.150
Stephanie, this is not a game.

36:41.180 --> 36:42.920
It's not about
winning or losing.

36:42.950 --> 36:44.750
It's just progress.

36:44.790 --> 36:47.520
Did it ever occur to you that
maybe things are a certain way

36:47.560 --> 36:49.020
for a reason?

36:49.060 --> 36:51.390
That tradition is
something to be preserved?

36:51.430 --> 36:53.190
Tradition?

36:55.460 --> 36:58.260
What are you doing
tomorrow night?

36:58.300 --> 36:59.730
Why?

36:59.770 --> 37:03.100
Well, I was wondering if...

37:03.140 --> 37:08.240
maybe you would wanna
go someplace with me.

37:08.280 --> 37:10.780
You mean, like a date?

37:10.810 --> 37:15.350
No, no, definitely,
definitely not a date.

37:15.380 --> 37:18.420
So, uh, where are we
gonna be going exactly

37:18.450 --> 37:20.190
on this not-date?

37:20.220 --> 37:22.290
It's a surprise.

37:22.320 --> 37:25.020
Ah. Well, at least tell me
what time I can pick you up.

37:25.060 --> 37:26.890
Oh, you're going to
pick me up, are you?

37:26.930 --> 37:29.300
Yeah. Tradition.

37:29.330 --> 37:30.730
Okay.

37:32.900 --> 37:36.570
Then this is my address.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.270
- I'll see you at seven.
- Okay.

37:38.310 --> 37:40.540
Excuse me, could you
help me find something

37:40.580 --> 37:42.580
for my little girl?

37:42.610 --> 37:43.880
Yeah, don't worry.
I got this covered.

37:43.910 --> 37:45.280
Okay.

37:45.310 --> 37:46.910
Right over here.

37:50.820 --> 37:53.890
It's not a date.
It's just a... you know.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.720
Business meeting?

37:55.760 --> 37:57.820
She's determined to make me
fall in love with Christmas.

37:57.860 --> 38:00.830
Do you ever ask yourself why he
agreed to be there at the shop?

38:00.860 --> 38:03.100
Maybe he felt bad.

38:03.130 --> 38:05.800
Or maybe he just wanted
to give the place a shot.

38:05.830 --> 38:09.000
I actually think that she does
have something special there.

38:09.040 --> 38:11.940
So what's the problem then?

38:11.970 --> 38:13.970
You and I both know
what this is really about.

38:14.010 --> 38:16.580
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

38:16.610 --> 38:18.980
You're the one complaining
about the women you date.

38:19.010 --> 38:19.980
And for good reason.

38:20.010 --> 38:22.520
Michael is different.

38:22.550 --> 38:24.620
He can actually be
pretty helpful...

38:24.650 --> 38:27.090
when he wants to be.

38:28.690 --> 38:31.490
You should've seen her
on television.

38:31.530 --> 38:34.090
Oh, yeah, this is just
a business meeting, all right.

38:34.130 --> 38:36.330
Sure. Come on.
Let's hit the ice.

38:36.360 --> 38:40.300
- Let me show you who's boss.
- Oh, you are so going down!

38:54.080 --> 38:56.320
Not a date,
not a date, not a date.

39:07.930 --> 39:09.730
Wow. You look...

39:09.760 --> 39:11.360
Wow.

39:11.400 --> 39:13.300
So do you.

39:13.330 --> 39:16.640
I mean, hi. Sorry.
Please come in.

39:19.110 --> 39:21.670
Wow, this is some place you got.

39:21.710 --> 39:24.740
What do you get
per square foot around here?

39:27.620 --> 39:29.580
Sorry, I can't turn it off.

39:29.620 --> 39:31.480
I was subletting
from a friend of mine,

39:31.520 --> 39:33.920
and then I just
kinda took it over.

39:33.960 --> 39:36.090
It's so close to the shop.
That's great.

39:36.120 --> 39:38.720
One of the many benefits.

39:38.760 --> 39:40.160
Are those...

39:40.190 --> 39:44.030
Oh, yeah, yeah,
these are for you.

39:44.070 --> 39:46.270
They're beautiful, thank you.

39:46.300 --> 39:48.500
I'll go find something
to put them in.

39:48.540 --> 39:50.140
Sounds good.

39:53.270 --> 39:55.780
So any clue as to where
we're going tonight?

39:55.810 --> 39:57.810
And ruin the surprise?

40:01.120 --> 40:04.180
Oh, hey, I think
I know your cousin.

40:07.050 --> 40:09.920
There we go. You ready?

40:09.960 --> 40:11.820
Lead the way.

40:25.010 --> 40:27.470
It's just
up ahead, I promise.

40:27.510 --> 40:29.240
Okay, I'm excited.

40:29.280 --> 40:30.440
We're here.

40:30.480 --> 40:32.880
Oh, what?

40:34.450 --> 40:35.680
Ooh.

40:38.120 --> 40:39.950
What is this?

40:39.990 --> 40:42.390
- Oh, you'll see.
- Uh-oh.

40:42.420 --> 40:44.020
After you.

40:49.460 --> 40:51.660
You sure we wouldn't be more
comfortable in the back?

40:51.700 --> 40:53.230
Relax.

40:56.340 --> 40:59.370
- You are gonna love this.
- Okay.

41:09.950 --> 41:14.150
♪♪

41:26.070 --> 41:29.170
Dave Koz?

41:29.200 --> 41:30.940
I thought you'd
appreciate it.

41:30.970 --> 41:33.140
Oh, Stephanie.

41:45.750 --> 41:48.050
You know the story
about this song?

41:48.090 --> 41:50.120
No, tell me.

41:50.160 --> 41:53.130
Well, originally
it was in German.

41:53.160 --> 41:54.830
It's called "O Tannenbaum,"

41:54.860 --> 41:56.900
and it wasn't Christmassy
at all.

41:56.930 --> 41:59.370
It was just a story
about a fir tree,

41:59.400 --> 42:02.700
and the fir tree
symbolized faithfulness.

42:02.740 --> 42:06.840
Later, once the tradition of
the Christmas tree got started,

42:06.870 --> 42:08.240
which was the late 1800s,

42:08.280 --> 42:10.740
that's when they added
some more lyrics

42:10.780 --> 42:13.050
and turned it
into the Christmas carol

42:13.080 --> 42:14.910
that we know and love today.

42:14.950 --> 42:17.550
Hmm, I didn't know that.

42:58.290 --> 43:01.190
That was amazing. How did you
know he was gonna perform?

43:01.230 --> 43:03.530
Stephanie!
Merry Christmas.

43:03.560 --> 43:05.530
Oh, it's great to see you.

43:05.570 --> 43:06.930
Dave, there's someone
I want you to meet.

43:06.970 --> 43:09.270
Dave, meet Michael.
Michael, meet Dave.

43:09.300 --> 43:11.440
- Michael, nice to meet you.
- Yeah, great to meet you too.

43:11.470 --> 43:13.610
- Did you enjoy the show?
- It was fantastic, yeah.

43:13.640 --> 43:14.940
- It was really fun.
- Great.

43:14.980 --> 43:16.710
I'm so happy
that you could come.

43:16.740 --> 43:18.910
And by the way, you were
so right about the poinsettias.

43:18.950 --> 43:21.410
Look how great
they look on our set.

43:21.450 --> 43:23.480
- Always happy to help.
- I really appreciate it.

43:23.520 --> 43:25.720
Listen, I gotta run.
Great to see you.

43:25.750 --> 43:27.390
All the best.
Great to meet you, Michael.

43:27.420 --> 43:29.420
- Yeah, a real pleasure.
- I appreciate you guys coming.

43:29.460 --> 43:30.660
- Thank you.
- Merry Christmas!

43:30.690 --> 43:32.420
- Merry Christmas!
- Bye.

43:34.460 --> 43:36.960
Okay, so how do you know him?

43:37.000 --> 43:38.800
- Who, Dave?
- Yeah.

43:38.830 --> 43:41.230
He's been coming
to our shop for years.

43:41.270 --> 43:43.270
Well, when he's actually
in town.

43:43.300 --> 43:46.910
Okay, yeah.
Dave Koz shops at your store.

43:46.940 --> 43:48.940
A lot of people do.

43:48.980 --> 43:52.480
Like I told you,
our shop is special.

44:02.420 --> 44:04.960
So you're really
into music, huh?

44:04.990 --> 44:09.090
Actually, once upon a time,
I wanted to be a music teacher.

44:09.130 --> 44:12.260
Well, I was a music teacher
briefly.

44:12.300 --> 44:13.670
- Really?
- Yeah.

44:13.700 --> 44:16.000
PS 238 in the Bronx.

44:16.040 --> 44:18.670
- What happened?
- Budget cuts.

44:18.710 --> 44:22.810
Apparently music appreciation
wasn't viewed as a necessity.

44:22.840 --> 44:24.980
Oh, that's such a shame.

44:25.010 --> 44:26.680
Luckily I had a fallback.

44:26.710 --> 44:28.950
My dad was really into
real estate for a long time,

44:28.980 --> 44:31.880
so it just kinda came
naturally to me.

44:31.920 --> 44:33.650
Really?

44:33.690 --> 44:35.950
Yeah, while all his friends
were saving up for college,

44:35.990 --> 44:37.460
he bought his first building.

44:37.490 --> 44:40.860
It was a rundown duplex
in Springfield, Ohio.

44:40.900 --> 44:43.530
Wait, you're from Ohio?

44:43.560 --> 44:45.330
Richland County,
born and raised.

44:45.370 --> 44:47.700
I would've thought
you were more of a--

44:47.740 --> 44:50.140
Big city guy?
Not a chance.

44:50.170 --> 44:52.710
Well, I've lived here
my whole life.

44:52.740 --> 44:56.840
Yeah, you strike me as the kinda
gal who likes to stay put.

44:56.880 --> 45:00.510
So do you ever work with him?

45:00.550 --> 45:03.050
- My dad?
- Mm-hmm.

45:03.080 --> 45:05.250
He, uh, he offered, you know.

45:05.290 --> 45:07.050
I think he always wanted me
to follow in his footsteps,

45:07.090 --> 45:09.890
but I just wanted to make it
on my own, you know?

45:09.920 --> 45:12.490
Do my own thing.

45:12.530 --> 45:16.730
Now it's my turn to show you
something cool.

45:16.760 --> 45:17.960
Come on.

45:19.230 --> 45:21.470
Who is that?

45:23.300 --> 45:26.340
Oh, this is one of
my favorite places in the city.

45:26.370 --> 45:27.840
Michael K.

45:27.880 --> 45:30.080
What's up, Randy?
I want you to meet--

45:30.110 --> 45:32.410
- Christmas girl.
- Randy.

45:34.480 --> 45:37.180
You're not the only one
who likes records, you know.

45:37.220 --> 45:38.920
That record you ordered came in.

45:38.950 --> 45:40.920
- I'm gonna grab it for you.
- All right.

45:42.120 --> 45:44.020
So let me get this straight.

45:44.060 --> 45:47.090
You know Dave Koz and Randy.

45:47.130 --> 45:50.100
Well, when my parents
downsized their apartment,

45:50.130 --> 45:53.100
I pretty much inherited
their entire collection.

45:53.130 --> 45:55.400
You could say
that's when I fell in love.

45:55.440 --> 45:57.300
Hmm.

45:57.340 --> 45:59.140
I always felt that music
had the potential

45:59.170 --> 46:01.270
to be honest and pure.

46:01.310 --> 46:03.040
It's not just about
tempo and melody.

46:03.080 --> 46:05.640
It's about the joy
that it brings people.

46:05.680 --> 46:06.780
Culture.

46:06.810 --> 46:09.750
The traditions?

46:09.780 --> 46:11.420
Exactly.

46:13.820 --> 46:15.320
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

46:15.360 --> 46:18.760
Wait, a Christmas album?

46:18.790 --> 46:19.990
Well, okay, first off,

46:20.030 --> 46:21.560
this is not
just a Christmas album.

46:21.600 --> 46:23.430
This is the Christmas album.

46:23.460 --> 46:25.330
Recorded by the Good Knights.

46:25.370 --> 46:26.930
- Oh, you know it?
- Know it?

46:26.970 --> 46:29.130
My grandmother used to play this
for us every year.

46:29.170 --> 46:32.070
I haven't heard
this album in years.

46:33.440 --> 46:34.970
You should have it.

46:35.010 --> 46:36.940
Wait, what?

46:36.980 --> 46:38.310
Yeah, no,
I want you to have it.

46:38.350 --> 46:39.950
No, Michael, I couldn't.

46:39.980 --> 46:43.080
Trust me, if anybody
deserves it, it's you.

46:45.490 --> 46:47.290
Thank you.

46:47.320 --> 46:49.960
You're welcome.

46:53.490 --> 46:55.090
I know Randy's store
is not for everyone,

46:55.130 --> 46:58.960
but for those who love it,
it's special.

46:59.000 --> 47:02.670
My family's shop isn't
much different, you know.

47:02.700 --> 47:05.370
You know Randy
used to be downtown?

47:05.410 --> 47:07.770
One day the building
that he was in

47:07.810 --> 47:09.880
decided they could make more
money with a big box store.

47:09.910 --> 47:12.110
Randy had to move.

47:12.150 --> 47:13.780
I didn't know that.

47:13.810 --> 47:17.480
That space that we were in?
I helped him find it.

47:17.520 --> 47:19.820
All you have to do is ask.

47:19.850 --> 47:26.730
Well, thank you for
a wonderful evening.

47:26.760 --> 47:29.130
Will you be okay getting home?

47:29.160 --> 47:32.660
I just have to pick something
else up on the way home.

47:32.700 --> 47:35.700
Well, good night.

47:36.740 --> 47:38.340

Uh, updating your software.

49:40.230 --> 49:42.460
And what's wrong with
the old software?

49:42.500 --> 49:45.300
Nothing.
I love a good abacus.

49:45.330 --> 49:47.330
- I mean, who doesn't, right?
- Funny.

49:47.370 --> 49:49.030
See, but with this program,

49:49.070 --> 49:51.440
it uses your WiFi
to connect your scanners,

49:51.470 --> 49:54.310
keeping track of your
inventory instantaneously.

49:54.340 --> 49:55.670
Speaking of which,
did you know that you're down

49:55.710 --> 49:58.040
to your last two sugarplum
music boxes?

Tradition doesn't have to be
outdated, Stephanie. Come on.

50:00.910 --> 50:03.780
Excuse me, do you have
any cookie cutters?

50:03.820 --> 50:06.150
- We sure do, they're--
- Allow me.

50:06.190 --> 50:08.320
I got this.
Right this way.

50:08.360 --> 50:11.490
Got everything you could
possibly ever dream of.

50:11.530 --> 50:14.260
We've got Santa Clauses,
snowflakes, Christmas trees.

50:17.060 --> 50:18.800
You're glowing!

50:18.830 --> 50:20.870
I am not.

50:20.900 --> 50:23.500
And he certainly seems
to be in a good mood.

50:23.540 --> 50:26.540
He does, doesn't he?

50:26.570 --> 50:28.840
Oh, hey, I was wondering
if you could watch the shop.

50:28.880 --> 50:30.210
I just have an appointment.

50:30.240 --> 50:31.840
Everything okay?

50:31.880 --> 50:34.350
Yeah, just a little something
I have to take care of.

50:34.380 --> 50:35.680
- Sure, whatever you need.
- Take this one?

50:35.720 --> 50:37.480
That feels right.
Excellent choice.

50:37.520 --> 50:39.150
Christmas tree, okay.

50:42.590 --> 50:44.420
So scan the item,

50:44.460 --> 50:48.330
and it deducts it
from your inventory instantly.

50:48.360 --> 50:51.860
Thank you.
That'll be $5.50.

50:51.900 --> 50:53.730
Here you go.

50:56.140 --> 50:57.670
Thank you.

50:57.700 --> 50:59.500
Thank you for shopping
at The Christmas Shop.

50:59.540 --> 51:01.440
Have a merry day.

51:01.480 --> 51:05.510
Okay, you are getting
pretty good at that.

51:05.550 --> 51:06.910
Don't you have work to do?

51:06.950 --> 51:09.710
Hey, what are you doing
Friday night? I...

51:09.750 --> 51:11.850
My brother has this
Christmas party every year,

51:11.890 --> 51:14.090
and I was wondering,
maybe if you're not busy,

51:14.120 --> 51:16.420
you'd like to come as my date.

51:16.460 --> 51:18.290
Date?

51:18.330 --> 51:20.390
We don't have to stay the whole
time if you don't want to.

51:20.430 --> 51:21.960
It's usually
just his co-workers,

51:22.000 --> 51:25.030
which are just a bunch
of boring computer people.

51:25.070 --> 51:26.930
Oh, you make it
sound so enticing.

51:26.970 --> 51:30.800
Well, they have Jenga,
so that's a win.

51:30.840 --> 51:33.040
I would love to,
I really would,

51:33.070 --> 51:36.140
but I have to set up
for the holiday block party.

51:36.180 --> 51:38.210
But if you find yourself
getting tired

51:38.250 --> 51:39.950
of your brother's co-workers--

51:39.980 --> 51:41.750
I'd love to.

51:41.780 --> 51:43.920
I mean, if you would
like me to help,

51:43.950 --> 51:46.250
I could come lend a hand.

51:46.290 --> 51:47.520
Of course.

51:51.130 --> 51:52.560
There she is!

51:52.590 --> 51:54.260
Mr. Cranston!

51:54.290 --> 51:56.160
Oh, good to see you.

51:56.200 --> 51:59.560
So how are the parents
enjoying retirement?

51:59.600 --> 52:01.500
Oh, they're great.

52:01.540 --> 52:04.600
Well, they're lucky to have you
look after the place.

52:04.640 --> 52:05.970
Oh, thank you.

52:06.010 --> 52:09.940
So what do you have
for us this year?

52:09.980 --> 52:11.580
I know it's in good hands.

52:11.610 --> 52:12.940
I will let you know
when it's done.

52:12.980 --> 52:14.910
All right.
Looking forward to it.

52:14.950 --> 52:16.380
Bye, bye.

52:17.780 --> 52:19.480
Is that a message from Santa?

52:19.520 --> 52:22.750
Mr. Cranston is one of our
oldest and dearest customers.

52:22.790 --> 52:24.420
About 35 years ago,

52:24.460 --> 52:26.790
he had an idea
for an ornament he wanted made.

52:26.830 --> 52:28.330
He brought the idea
to my father,

52:28.360 --> 52:30.830
and he created him something.

52:30.860 --> 52:32.500
Ever since, he's been
coming here every year

52:32.530 --> 52:34.270
with a new subject,

52:34.300 --> 52:36.540
something
to share with his wife.

52:36.570 --> 52:38.140
And you make him an ornament.

52:38.170 --> 52:41.710
It could be a moment,
a memory, a milestone.

52:41.740 --> 52:43.710
One year, it was
the birth of their son.

52:43.740 --> 52:46.480
Another, it was
a special vacation they took.

52:46.510 --> 52:48.810
What was the subject
this year?

52:54.350 --> 52:55.820
Their first date.

52:56.820 --> 52:58.860
What are we gonna make?

52:58.890 --> 53:00.860
I don't know.

53:00.890 --> 53:02.260
Oh.

53:06.230 --> 53:08.370
- Something urgent?
- It won't take long.

53:08.400 --> 53:10.340
- Erika?
- Go. We got this.

53:10.370 --> 53:12.470
- Don't we?
- Absolutely.

53:12.510 --> 53:13.670
Thanks.

53:18.910 --> 53:22.080
686 square feet.

53:22.120 --> 53:23.920
The building's
just been renovated.

53:23.950 --> 53:25.950
There is tremendous
foot traffic here.

53:25.990 --> 53:28.120
Great visibility.

53:28.160 --> 53:30.320
It's very nice.

53:30.360 --> 53:32.660
So what is it you say you do?

53:32.690 --> 53:35.260
Uh, retail. Our family--

53:35.300 --> 53:38.560
Well, I own a Christmas shop
on the Upper West Side.

53:38.600 --> 53:40.770
I think I saw that on the news.

53:40.800 --> 53:43.100
Didn't Helen MacLaine
buy that building?

53:43.140 --> 53:46.570
Yep, that's the one.

53:46.610 --> 53:48.670
I'm curious,
what is it your store does

53:48.710 --> 53:50.310
for the rest of the year?

53:50.340 --> 53:51.640
What do you mean?

53:51.680 --> 53:54.580
Well, when
it's not Christmastime.

53:54.620 --> 53:57.780
Oh, well, we sell decorations
for other holidays as well.

53:57.820 --> 54:01.520
St. Patrick's Day,
Valentine's Day, Easter.

54:01.560 --> 54:02.790
Oh, um...

54:04.960 --> 54:06.630
- Ms. Nichol.
- Mm-hmm?

54:06.660 --> 54:08.790
I'm going to be
very honest with you.

54:08.830 --> 54:11.300
The people
that own this property,

54:11.330 --> 54:13.100
they were looking for something

54:13.130 --> 54:16.030
with a little more
ongoing potential,

54:16.070 --> 54:19.770
like a juice bar
or a yoga studio.

54:19.810 --> 54:21.570
Right.

54:23.040 --> 54:25.480
Of course.

54:25.510 --> 54:28.180
You never know
until you try, right?

54:28.220 --> 54:31.550
I, um, I do have a property
in Jersey City.

54:31.590 --> 54:34.450
That might be a little more
up your alley.

54:34.490 --> 54:38.020
Yeah. I'll think about it.

55:03.450 --> 55:05.050
<i>Hello?</i>

55:05.090 --> 55:07.050
It's me.

55:07.090 --> 55:09.520
Hey, your father and I
are in the middle of a game.

55:09.560 --> 55:11.760
He thinks Kringle
is a real word.

55:11.790 --> 55:13.430
It is a real word!

55:13.460 --> 55:15.090
What's going on?

55:15.130 --> 55:16.830
<i> I don't think I can do it.</i>

55:16.860 --> 55:18.230
Do what, sweetheart?

55:18.270 --> 55:21.000
Save the shop.

55:21.030 --> 55:24.870
<i> I tried, Mom, I really did.</i>

55:24.910 --> 55:26.600
The shop just doesn't
make enough money

55:26.640 --> 55:28.570
to qualify for a new lease.

55:28.610 --> 55:30.340
Oh, honey.

55:30.380 --> 55:33.580
<i> I know how important the shop</i>
<i> is to you and Dad,</i>

55:33.610 --> 55:37.120
but it just, it just seems
like everything's changing.

55:37.150 --> 55:40.720
And I'm trying so hard
to hold onto it,

55:40.750 --> 55:42.220
<i> to preserve something</i>
<i> that means so much</i>

55:42.260 --> 55:43.520
<i> to so many people.</i>

55:43.560 --> 55:45.520
Well, you did
the best you could.

55:45.560 --> 55:48.260
Then why do I feel like
I'm letting you down?

55:48.300 --> 55:50.530
<i> Not just you and Dad,</i>

55:50.560 --> 55:55.300
but Erika and Toby
and all the customers.

55:55.340 --> 55:57.140
Honey, you didn't let us down.

55:57.170 --> 56:00.270
We don't need the shop to be
happy. We have each other.

56:00.310 --> 56:02.870
<i> That's what's important.</i>
<i> That's all we've ever needed.</i>

56:02.910 --> 56:04.240
<i> And you know what?</i>

56:04.280 --> 56:06.480
We'll make new traditions.

56:06.510 --> 56:09.580
<i> Erika and Toby will be fine.</i>
<i> The customers will be fine.</i>

56:09.620 --> 56:13.490
<i> And your father and I</i>
<i> will always be proud of you,</i>

56:13.520 --> 56:17.660
<i> no matter what, okay?</i>

56:17.690 --> 56:19.490
<i> Now Christmas is in four days.</i>

56:19.530 --> 56:23.760
You make it the best four days
that shop has ever seen, okay?

56:23.800 --> 56:25.830
Okay.

56:25.870 --> 56:27.570
You got it.

56:34.640 --> 56:36.240
Well?

56:36.280 --> 56:38.910
It isn't here,
but I gave you "frankincense."

56:38.950 --> 56:41.380
Frankincense is a word.

56:44.120 --> 56:46.080
- Dan.
- Hmm?

56:46.120 --> 56:47.920
What are we doing here?

56:47.950 --> 56:49.620
Playing a game.

56:49.660 --> 56:50.960
No, I mean here.

56:50.990 --> 56:54.190
- I mean, don't you feel--
- Bored?

56:54.230 --> 56:56.260
I miss the city.

56:56.300 --> 56:58.530
We don't belong here.

56:58.570 --> 57:00.530
We belong there,
with our daughter.

57:00.570 --> 57:03.330
Well, then let's go home.

57:05.170 --> 57:06.440
Really?

57:06.470 --> 57:07.840
Yeah.

57:07.870 --> 57:09.440
Oh!

57:09.480 --> 57:11.710
I love you!

57:11.750 --> 57:13.340
Does this mean
I can order bacon again?

57:13.380 --> 57:15.580
- No.
- No?

57:23.090 --> 57:24.690
All right, well, yeah,

57:24.720 --> 57:27.530
let's get those over
to the office, all right?

57:27.560 --> 57:30.460
- Okay, thank you.
- Yes, sir.

57:37.500 --> 57:39.370
Helen, what are you
doing here?

57:39.410 --> 57:41.140
Everything proceeding
on schedule?

57:41.170 --> 57:43.410
Yeah, don't worry.
They'll be out on time

57:43.440 --> 57:45.210
if that's what you're
concerned about.

57:45.250 --> 57:47.410
Is that what you think?

57:47.450 --> 57:49.210
They're good people.

57:49.250 --> 57:51.120
I'm sure they are.

57:56.860 --> 58:01.230
Michael, I realize that I put
a lot of responsibility

58:01.260 --> 58:02.760
on your shoulders,

58:02.800 --> 58:05.430
but I haven't heard from you
in three days,

58:05.470 --> 58:10.070
so I wanted to come down here
and see how you were doing.

58:10.100 --> 58:13.400
Look, the permits have been
submitted and approved.

58:13.440 --> 58:15.210
They think that
they can preserve

58:15.240 --> 58:16.910
some of the facade
as a focal point,

58:16.940 --> 58:18.940
if you're still interested.

58:18.980 --> 58:23.410
I wanted to come down
to see how you were doing.

58:25.950 --> 58:27.220
Excuse me, can you help me
find something?

58:27.250 --> 58:29.590
Oh, of course, yeah.
Excuse me.

58:31.830 --> 58:34.790
So are you looking for
something for your parents?

58:34.830 --> 58:36.030
No, my teacher.

58:36.060 --> 58:37.460
Oh, what grade are you in?

58:37.500 --> 58:39.400
Third grade,
but we're leaving.

58:39.430 --> 58:40.770
Oh?

58:40.800 --> 58:44.070
My family and I
are moving to Seattle.

58:44.100 --> 58:45.300
Seattle's a nice place.

58:45.340 --> 58:47.210
I don't wanna move.

58:47.240 --> 58:49.270
You know,
when I was about your age,

58:49.310 --> 58:50.810
I had to move too.

58:50.840 --> 58:51.880
To Seattle?

58:51.910 --> 58:54.310
No, it was to Ohio.

58:54.350 --> 58:55.750
My dad got a job there,

58:55.780 --> 58:57.780
so we had to pack up
everything that we owned

58:57.820 --> 58:59.750
and put it into these boxes

58:59.790 --> 59:01.320
and get it all onto
a great big truck.

59:01.350 --> 59:03.290
My mom let me
pack my own toys.

59:03.320 --> 59:06.390
Yeah? Well, you know
what happened after that?

59:06.430 --> 59:08.260
I met my best friend Jack.

59:08.300 --> 59:11.160
Yeah. We went everywhere
together. He was the best.

59:11.200 --> 59:13.460
We went to the movies,
we went to the library.

59:13.500 --> 59:15.800
He even taught my brother
and I how to play hockey.

59:15.840 --> 59:18.970
- So guess what happened next?
- What?

59:19.010 --> 59:21.470
I wasn't sad anymore.
In fact, it turned out to be

59:21.510 --> 59:23.780
one of the best things
that ever happened to me.

59:23.810 --> 59:25.780
I don't want Ms. Hill
to forget me.

59:25.810 --> 59:27.780
- Is that your teacher?
- Yeah.

59:27.810 --> 59:29.350
Do you have like, um...

59:29.380 --> 59:31.950
Do you have like a favorite
memory from your class?

59:31.990 --> 59:35.520
Last week she read us a book
about a gingerbread family.

59:35.560 --> 59:37.320
Yeah? Hmm.

59:41.230 --> 59:42.360
Come with me.

59:42.400 --> 59:45.330
I got the perfect thing for you.

59:47.870 --> 59:49.270
What do you think?

59:49.300 --> 59:50.870
It's just like the one
in the book!

59:50.900 --> 59:52.600
Well, then I'm sure
she'll love it.

59:52.640 --> 59:53.670
How much?

59:53.710 --> 59:54.970
Tell you what.

59:55.010 --> 59:57.480
If you give Seattle
a fair shot,

59:57.510 --> 01:00:00.140
it's on me, okay?

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:02.780
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:11.560
Your boss left.

01:00:11.590 --> 01:00:13.060
Ah, that's too bad.

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:17.130
So that was very sweet.

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.960
Oh, well, you know,
somebody once told me

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.670
that the best ornaments
are the ones that say things.

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:25.400
Hmm.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:28.540
Sounds like someone very wise.

01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:29.940
And special.

01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:35.650
- Uh, speaking of ornaments...
- Yes?

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:38.750
I believe that we have
a first date ornament to make.

01:00:38.790 --> 01:00:41.050
- Oh, we do, do we?
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:43.550
Come on, open this letter up.
Let's see what it says.

01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:49.990
<i>I remember</i>
<i> the very first date</i>

01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:52.460
<i> Mary and I ever had.</i>

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:55.030
<i> I was working as a fry cook</i>

01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:58.800
<i> in a little diner</i>
<i> in San Francisco.</i>

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:03.370
<i> One late December night,</i>
<i> I'm in the back.</i>

01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:08.150
<i> Someone's crooning</i>
<i> "Jingle Bells" on the jukebox.</i>

01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:11.220
<i> And that's when Mary walked i.</i>

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:13.750
<i> Her eyes sparkled</i>
<i> like ice crystals</i>

01:01:13.790 --> 01:01:15.990
<i> on fresh fallen snow.</i>

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:18.920
<i> Her smile lit up</i>
<i> the whole room.</i>

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:23.030
<i> We must've talked for hours.</i>

01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:25.430
<i> And then I asked her to dance.</i>

01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:29.330
<i> Right there in the middle</i>
<i> of that greasy diner.</i>

01:01:29.370 --> 01:01:30.940
<i> Hmm!</i>

01:01:30.970 --> 01:01:35.370
<i> And I knew I would be</i>
<i> dancing with this woman</i>

01:01:35.410 --> 01:01:38.180
<i> for the rest of my life.</i>

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:44.250
- Hmm.
- Oh, I got it.

01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:14.580
Do you wanna help?

01:02:14.610 --> 01:02:17.580
I'm not really
the artistic type.

01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:20.120
Come on, this is your idea.

01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:22.120
Grab me a brush.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.450
Tiny one.

01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:24.660
Uh, other one.

01:02:25.630 --> 01:02:27.190
Bingo.

01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:28.790
Okay, here.

01:02:28.830 --> 01:02:32.260
Okay, now dip lightly.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.430
Okay.

01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:38.400
And then make a circle
right in the middle.

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:44.740
- All right, not bad.
- Hmm!

01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:46.880
You know, I think this
could use some glitter.

01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:48.780
And you said you weren't
the artistic type.

01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:49.950
When in Rome...

01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:51.450
- Right there.
- Yeah?

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.090
- Yep.
- Oh, here? Oop.

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.750
Gold or silver?

01:02:55.790 --> 01:02:58.020
- Hmm.
- What are you thinking?

01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:03.530
That one.
And then sprinkle it lightly.

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:06.660
No, I said lightly!

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:07.970
That was lightly.

01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:17.210
Beautiful.

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:21.110
It is a beautiful night,
isn't it?

01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:24.350
- I mean you.
- Me?

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:27.190
Yeah, I had no idea
how talented you were.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:29.350
Oh, thank you,

01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:33.190
but I've never really
thought of myself as talented.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.830
Well, here we are.

01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:40.100
After you.

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:46.470
Oh.

01:03:48.010 --> 01:03:51.040
Oh, my goodness,
look at that!

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.880
That's just beautiful.
Oh, yes.

01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:58.080
That's me,
and that's you, honey.

01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:02.750
Stephanie, this is perfect,
as always.

01:04:02.790 --> 01:04:04.390
It was Michael's idea.

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:06.690
And it comes with this.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.860
Oh, hon, look!

01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:12.360
They've even got the record.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.500
This will look great
on the tree

01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:16.730
with the other ornaments
you've given us.

01:04:19.070 --> 01:04:21.770
And to think all I was
trying to do that night

01:04:21.810 --> 01:04:23.770
was get in out of the rain.

01:04:23.810 --> 01:04:26.880
And I was just
trying to finish up those dishes

01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:30.010
so I could go home.

01:04:30.050 --> 01:04:33.150
And now
we've got all these memories.

01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:41.360
Stephanie,
that's a very special shop

01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:43.090
you got there.

01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:44.830
Take good care of it.

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:53.870
Oh, honey, this is beautiful.

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:01.610
The shop made all these?

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.420
They're beautiful.

01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:06.620
And every one is personal.

01:05:21.330 --> 01:05:23.300
Do all of your customers

01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:25.340
have a collection
like Mr. Cranston?

01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:28.140
- Quite a few. Why?
- I was just thinking.

01:05:28.170 --> 01:05:31.740
Where are they gonna go
if your shop closes down?

01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:34.750
Well, tell that
to Helen MacLaine.

01:05:37.050 --> 01:05:38.820
You know what?

01:05:38.850 --> 01:05:40.480
I think I will.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.590
Wait, really?

01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:43.420
Yeah.

01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:47.090
I'm not gonna let her
close the shop.

01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:55.200
I, uh...

01:05:55.230 --> 01:05:58.100
- We should, uh--
- Definitely.

01:05:58.140 --> 01:05:59.940
Yeah, I think, uh...

01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:03.670
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:05.140
Oh, yeah,
I'll see you tomorrow too.

01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:06.340
Yeah.

01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:08.250
Have a good night.

01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:13.480
Yes!

01:06:27.530 --> 01:06:28.630
Michael.

01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:30.330
We have to talk.

01:06:33.070 --> 01:06:36.910
This Christmas Shop is unique
and a special place.

01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:39.580
It means so much to the people
in that community.

01:06:39.610 --> 01:06:43.710
I know it's old-fashioned,
but you know what? That's okay.

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:46.250
Because if you want
hip and urban,

01:06:46.290 --> 01:06:49.020
there is a whole city
out there for you.

01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:55.190
But if you want someplace
that's sweet and magical,

01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:57.930
then shouldn't there be
someplace you can go?

01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:59.830
What are you suggesting?

01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:03.600
Let 'em stay.

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:05.600
We talked about this.

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:07.070
You transfer the lease
to the new building,

01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:08.570
give 'em the same terms.

01:07:08.610 --> 01:07:11.510
They're paying 75%
below market value.

01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:13.010
They've been there
for 40 years!

01:07:13.050 --> 01:07:15.010
I can appreciate tradition.

01:07:15.050 --> 01:07:18.680
This company goes back
five generations.

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.080
I mean, my great great
grandfather

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.420
worked along
Reginald Vanderbilt himself.

01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:25.790
Our investors expect a return.

01:07:25.830 --> 01:07:27.960
A return is based on
anticipated revenue.

01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:30.060
What kind of revenue
can I promise

01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:31.800
when I'm giving
my tenants a discount?

01:07:31.830 --> 01:07:33.400
I'm not talking
about all of them.

01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:34.870
I'm just talking about
that one.

01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:37.400
We have full occupancy
at this point,

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:40.100
and I've got over a hundred
names on the wait list.

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:42.170
Please.

01:07:43.410 --> 01:07:45.480
I'm sorry, Michael, I can't.

01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:47.550
I can't.

01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:54.390
Then consider this
my resignation.

01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:57.290
Michael...

01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:00.290
If you're gonna kick 'em out,
I'm not gonna be a part of it.

01:08:39.970 --> 01:08:42.430
Oh, wow, Stephanie.

01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:44.569
You weren't kidding.

01:08:55.450 --> 01:08:57.350
- Michael!
- Stephanie.

01:08:57.380 --> 01:08:58.819
- Hi!
- Hi.

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:04.189
We have to talk.

01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:06.760
Is there a place
that we can go?

01:09:06.790 --> 01:09:08.990
- Okay.
- Yeah?

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.270
So...

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:20.670
how did it go?

01:09:22.109 --> 01:09:23.609
It's over.

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:25.439
What?

01:09:25.479 --> 01:09:26.880
Stephanie, I am so sorry.

01:09:26.910 --> 01:09:28.880
There's just nothing
that I can do.

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:30.710
I-I don't understand.

01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:34.420
You've seen how important
this place is to everyone.

01:09:34.450 --> 01:09:37.920
Helen's hands are tied.
The building's already full.

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:40.720
It hasn't even been built yet.

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.729
I know.

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:46.760
Maybe, maybe you can
just talk to her again.

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:48.170
I can't.

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.229
Why not?

01:09:49.270 --> 01:09:52.000
- Because I quit.
- What?

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:54.370
I couldn't be a part
of doing this to you.

01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:58.940
- Michael--
- I'm so sorry.

01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:01.410
I feel like I'm letting
everybody down. I just...

01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:07.550
I wanted to give you
your Christmas miracle.

01:10:09.390 --> 01:10:13.360
I know. I appreciate
everything that you've done.

01:10:13.390 --> 01:10:18.730
I guess we just ran out
of time, that's all.

01:10:21.370 --> 01:10:22.930
Yeah.

01:10:22.970 --> 01:10:26.870
Um, with everything
that's going on,

01:10:26.910 --> 01:10:29.940
I think I need
some alone time.

01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:33.780
Yeah, I understand.

01:10:33.810 --> 01:10:34.850
Okay.

01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:39.920
- If you need anything--
- Mm-hmm.

Lease?

01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:57.960
Hey, it's me.

01:12:57.990 --> 01:13:01.490
Yeah, you got that paperwork
on the Broadway Towers project?

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:06.600
How far back does it go?

01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:40.630
All right, there you go, man.

01:13:40.670 --> 01:13:42.700
Don't tell your mom how much
money you spent, all right?

01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:45.370
Hey, are these
all the snowmen you have?

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:48.310
Look at you!

01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:49.670
Mom, Dad?

01:13:49.710 --> 01:13:51.340
- Sweetheart!
- There's my girl.

01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:53.110
- Hi, sweetie.
- Oh.

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:57.680
I don't understand.
What are you doing here?

01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:01.650
Well, we had a chat after
you called the other day and--

01:14:01.690 --> 01:14:02.720
The city's our home.

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:04.920
We belong here with you.

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:06.590
Even if it is
a little packed.

01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:09.090
And the taxis
are a little loud.

01:14:09.130 --> 01:14:10.930
Looks like you're
stuck with us, honey.

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:14.100
Guys, I am so sorry.

01:14:14.130 --> 01:14:17.030
You left me in charge,
and I really let you down.

01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:19.700
I just really thought
Michael would be able to help.

01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:21.870
- Sounds like he really tried.
- I suppose you're right.

01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:23.940
I guess it doesn't
matter anymore

01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:26.780
'cause next year everyone's
gonna go to some big box store

01:14:26.810 --> 01:14:28.850
for their
Christmas decorations.

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:30.850
But every once in a while

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:34.550
someone will remember
that little shop on the corner,

01:14:34.590 --> 01:14:36.420
where they felt magical.

01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:38.260
Used to.

01:14:38.290 --> 01:14:41.790
You know honey, whether you want
them to or not, things change.

01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:44.960
Sometimes for the better,
sometimes for the worse.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.030
How you adapt to that change
is all up to you, huh?

01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:50.600
It's Christmas Eve.

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:52.370
Do you really wanna
spend the holiday moping?

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:55.770
Or are we gonna think about
things we can really celebrate?

01:14:55.810 --> 01:14:57.880
Now go out there
and make us proud.

01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:08.890
He had a broad face
and a little round belly

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:10.490
that shook when he laughed,

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:13.020
like a bowl full of jelly.

01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:17.490
He was chubby and plump,
a right jolly old elf,

01:15:17.530 --> 01:15:21.830
and I laughed when I saw him,
in spite of myself.

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:30.470
A wink of his eye
and a twist of his head

01:15:30.510 --> 01:15:33.640
soon gave me to know
I had nothing to dread.

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:35.250
Aw, thanks!

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:38.550
He spoke not a word,
but went straight to his work,

01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:42.520
and filled all the stockings
and then turned with a jerk.

01:15:45.390 --> 01:15:46.990
Oh, no, thank you.

01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:51.190
Um, could you tell me
where to find Stephanie Nichol?

01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:56.870
Thank you.

01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:59.900
But I heard him exclaim
ere he drove out of sight,

01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:03.640
"Merry Christmas to all,
and to all a good night!"

01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:20.120
What are you doing here?

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:21.890
You didn't think
I was gonna miss the biggest

01:16:21.930 --> 01:16:26.060
and the best holiday party
on the Upper West Side, did you?

01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:29.130
You were wonderful.

01:16:29.170 --> 01:16:31.030
Thank you.

01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:33.540
Not bad.

01:16:33.570 --> 01:16:38.380
Helen! I didn't expect
to see you here.

01:16:38.410 --> 01:16:39.610
Michael called me
this afternoon

01:16:39.650 --> 01:16:42.550
and asked me to come down.

01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:44.480
What's up?

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:46.320
Well, last night, on a whim,

01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:47.950
I decided to take a look
at the paperwork

01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:50.950
from the acquisition
of the building.

01:16:50.990 --> 01:16:52.660
I found this.

01:16:52.690 --> 01:16:54.660
Michael, I've had
several attorneys

01:16:54.690 --> 01:16:57.130
review the transfer
from the property's trust.

01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:59.630
I assure you
there are no issues.

01:16:59.670 --> 01:17:01.260
Maybe not with the trust,

01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:04.840
but this is the original lease
from The Christmas Shop.

01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:07.940
Mr. Nichol,
perhaps you remember this.

01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:11.440
Um, that's my old lease.

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:14.480
40 years ago,
when your dad opened the store,

01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:15.980
the building was
owned by his friend.

01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:18.480
Ben. Yeah, but he passed away
a long time ago.

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.180
He must've liked you a lot

01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:22.290
because he put a very
interesting clause in there.

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:24.290
5B, if you care to read.

01:17:26.530 --> 01:17:27.860
Basically it says that,

01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:29.190
in the event
that the building is sold,

01:17:29.230 --> 01:17:31.530
either by him or his heir...

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:33.630
"The Christmas Shop

01:17:33.670 --> 01:17:36.800
has the option
to purchase the building."

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:38.340
We do?

01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:45.140
He's not kidding.

01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:47.380
"In the event that
the building is sold,

01:17:47.410 --> 01:17:49.680
the lessor will be
given first option

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:52.720
to purchase the building
at fair market value."

01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:58.160
But, Michael,
at fair market value,

01:17:58.190 --> 01:18:02.090
there's no way
we'd be able to afford it.

01:18:02.130 --> 01:18:03.560
I know.

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:06.860
That's why you need
an investor.

01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:08.400
Who's that?

01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:10.030
My father.

01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:13.540
Hey, son.

01:18:13.570 --> 01:18:15.340
You must be Stephanie.

01:18:15.370 --> 01:18:17.340
Michael spoke
very highly of you

01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:19.180
when he called me last night.

01:18:19.210 --> 01:18:21.550
Michael...
Michael called you?

01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:24.310
Yes, yes.
And is the store inside?

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:27.580
Yes.

01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:30.120
Would you like to see it?

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:32.820
I'd be delighted. Please.

01:18:45.970 --> 01:18:47.700
Very whimsical.

01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:52.780
This is adorable.

01:18:59.650 --> 01:19:00.720
Ah!

01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:02.650
Smells like Christmas.

01:19:06.690 --> 01:19:09.330
You know, when my son
called me last night

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:10.790
and told me about this store,

01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:13.560
I knew it had to be
something special.

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:16.130
Now, standing here...

01:19:17.970 --> 01:19:19.800
I knew he was right.

01:19:21.370 --> 01:19:24.170
Thank you so much,
Mr. Kilpatrick.

01:19:24.210 --> 01:19:26.180
Please, call me Thomas.

01:19:26.210 --> 01:19:28.480
And I should be
the one thanking you.

01:19:28.510 --> 01:19:30.780
For what?

01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:33.720
For giving me something I've
wanted for a very long time.

01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:40.760
Finally something
we can do together.

01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:44.690
Deep down I think I always knew
you weren't happy.

01:19:44.730 --> 01:19:47.930
But now I can see you found
a place where you belong,

01:19:47.970 --> 01:19:52.440
and I want nothing more
but to be a part of that.

01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:57.510
Yes.

01:19:57.540 --> 01:20:01.850
I would be proud to invest
in such a delightful venture.

01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:09.490
Who are these lovely people
over here?

01:20:11.490 --> 01:20:13.290
This is my mom,
and this is my dad.

01:20:13.330 --> 01:20:15.530
- How are you, sir?
- This is Mr. Kilpatrick.

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:17.690
Such a lovely daughter
you have,

01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:21.730
and what a beautiful store.

01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:24.700
I'm sorry about
your development, Helen,

01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:29.640
but Mr. Nichol had a deal.

01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:31.680
How are you?

01:20:34.010 --> 01:20:36.680
It's only a building.

01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:39.380
Our investors
will find other deals.

01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:41.250
As for you,

01:20:41.290 --> 01:20:44.860
I knew your heart
wasn't in real estate.

01:20:44.890 --> 01:20:48.490
I'm just glad that you found
what truly makes you happy.

01:20:48.530 --> 01:20:50.530
Thank you.

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:53.030
You gotta promise me something.

01:20:53.070 --> 01:20:54.400
Anything.

01:20:54.430 --> 01:20:57.730
Take good care of her.
She's a keeper.

01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:04.110
I intend to.

01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:05.540
Merry Christmas.

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.920
I invited Dave
and his family over

01:21:15.950 --> 01:21:18.290
to join me for
Christmas dinner tomorrow.

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:21.760
I'd very much like it
if the two of you would join.

01:21:21.790 --> 01:21:24.030
- It's a date.
- Very well then.

01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:26.630
I'll look forward
to seeing you both tomorrow.

01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:28.100
Merry Christmas, Dad.

01:21:29.130 --> 01:21:31.770
Merry Christmas, son.

01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:37.610
Of course,
if you have other plans...

01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:40.210
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:45.450
I know what it meant
for you to call your dad,

01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:48.080
so thank you...

01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:49.950
for everything.

01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:52.420
Merry Christmas.

01:21:52.460 --> 01:21:54.290
Merry Christmas.

01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:22.420
Got it.

01:22:22.450 --> 01:22:24.420
Well, thank you for shopping
at The Christmas Shop.

01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:25.960
Have a merry day.

01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:28.260
Hey, we got a phone order
for two musical wreaths.

01:22:28.290 --> 01:22:29.730
Got it.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.130
Honey, how can I tell which
orders have been processed?

01:22:35.170 --> 01:22:37.300
I think they're the ones
in that column.

01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:38.840
We got two more orders.

01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:40.840
Oh, uh, you know what?
I can handle this.

01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:42.910
You take care of the computer.

01:22:48.810 --> 01:22:52.050
- Well, we did it!
- We sure did.

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.950
And if things
keep up like this,

01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:56.450
we'll be able to pay your dad
back for that down payment in...

01:22:56.490 --> 01:22:57.490
next month.

01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:59.020
And, you know what?

01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:01.660
I still think that this is
a pretty special place.

01:23:01.690 --> 01:23:03.660
It is, isn't it?

01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:05.100
Thank you.

01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:09.670
Now... let's talk
about franchising.

01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:11.300
Uh, no.

01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:13.670
Come on, we can have
a Christmas Shop in New York,

01:23:13.710 --> 01:23:17.370
Chicago, LA,
San Diego, San Francisco.
