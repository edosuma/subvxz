[tires squeal]

00:34.785 --> 00:36.696
Oh, hey.
Uh, Sheriff.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.451
Your Jane Doe
is right over--

00:38.664 --> 00:40.245
She's not a Jane Doe.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.626
Do you want me to...

01:22.875 --> 01:24.661
I can pray with you
if you'd like.

01:28.881 --> 01:29.870
What?

01:31.092 --> 01:32.707
Would you like me to pray
with you?

01:32.927 --> 01:34.508
She must've meant a lot
to you.

01:36.764 --> 01:37.879
It's not Donna.

01:39.934 --> 01:41.515
Oh, my Lord.
But, uh--

01:41.727 --> 01:43.979
But the description
on the report...

01:45.147 --> 01:48.014
Oh, I feel terrible
that I put you through this.

01:48.234 --> 01:50.566
It's just I couldn't get Sheriff
Wilkins to come down here

01:50.820 --> 01:52.560
to ID. our Jane Doe, and...

01:53.823 --> 01:55.063
I'm so sorry.

01:57.994 --> 01:58.983
There's no need.

02:00.413 --> 02:01.528
You did the right thing.

02:07.086 --> 02:10.044
So, should I try
to get Sheriff Wilkins again?

02:13.467 --> 02:14.092
No.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.515
Hey there, Eamonn.

02:32.236 --> 02:33.191
God.

02:33.654 --> 02:34.939
Hey, Walt.

02:35.156 --> 02:37.943
This is a creepy
sort of surprise.

02:40.161 --> 02:42.402
I need to talk to you
inside.

02:43.664 --> 02:44.949
Look, I don't know what Vic told
you--

02:45.166 --> 02:47.623
-I don't care about you and Vic.
-Well, you say that,

02:47.835 --> 02:49.746
but it's after 10:00
and you're lying in wait.

02:49.962 --> 02:52.044
-l'm not lying in wait.
-You're sitting in the dark,

02:52.256 --> 02:54.963
-your truck's nowhere to be seen.
-'Cause I don't want to be seen.

02:55.176 --> 02:57.007
-|t's basically the definition --
-|t's about your boss.

03:03.893 --> 03:05.679
-|t's a little hard to believe.
-|s it?

03:06.562 --> 03:08.223
How much
did Sheriff Wilkins receive

03:08.439 --> 03:11.021
in, uh, campaign donations from
Newett Energy last election?

03:11.233 --> 03:12.484
I don't know.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.900
I do.
I looked it up.

03:15.112 --> 03:16.522
Every member
of their board

03:16.739 --> 03:18.855
wrote the maximum check
allowable by law.

03:19.075 --> 03:21.157
Just because he's accepting
political contributions

03:21.369 --> 03:22.859
doesn't mean he's protecting
a criminal.

03:23.079 --> 03:24.990
-And yet that's what he's doing.
-According to you.

03:25.206 --> 03:27.822
Why else would he check Walker
Browning out of the hospital

03:28.042 --> 03:29.248
and ban me from his county

03:29.460 --> 03:30.870
unless he's trying to hide
something from me?

03:31.087 --> 03:33.419
When you say "ban," you mean
in the legal sense of ban?

03:33.631 --> 03:35.496
-Like a restraining order?
-I don't know.

03:38.052 --> 03:40.088
that matched
my missing person.

03:40.304 --> 03:42.511
That seems like a cover-up
to me.

03:43.265 --> 03:44.175
[sighs]

03:45.059 --> 03:45.889
All right.

03:47.436 --> 03:51.554
Even if all of this were true,
what do you want me to do?

03:51.774 --> 03:52.729
Help me.

03:53.651 --> 03:55.892
Keep an eye out
for Walker Browning.

03:56.404 --> 03:57.439
Can you do that?

03:58.364 --> 03:59.524
I don't know.

04:02.243 --> 04:03.608
I'll think about it.

04:07.081 --> 04:08.412
Fair enough.

04:33.482 --> 04:34.642
[grunts]

04:54.545 --> 04:55.625
Shit.

04:56.464 --> 04:57.453
Don't move, asshole.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.761
-Take off that mask.
-No.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.552
Take it off
or you're dead.

05:05.765 --> 05:07.881
-You can't kill me.
-Oh, really?

05:08.100 --> 05:09.180
Why not?

05:09.643 --> 05:13.511
Because Hector lives,
and because I know you.

05:14.356 --> 05:17.644
You're a thief.
But you're not a murderer.

05:25.701 --> 05:26.451
[gunshoï¬‚

05:45.721 --> 05:47.177
[knock on door]

05:48.057 --> 05:49.513
Hey, Sheriff.

05:49.725 --> 05:51.716
You didn't by chance stop by
the print shed last night

05:51.936 --> 05:53.051
and pick up your Bronco?

05:54.021 --> 05:56.353
-Yep.
-Ah.

05:56.565 --> 05:59.477
So normally when I'm collecting
evidence on a vehicle,

05:59.693 --> 06:00.899
it helps
to not have somebody

06:01.111 --> 06:02.976
take the vehicle
in the middle of the night.

06:03.197 --> 06:04.812
-How's Larry doing?
-What?

06:07.159 --> 06:09.901
Larry, the arson investigator
who's going over Donna's van.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.200
He got pulled away.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.445
Uh, suspicious brush fire
at Pronghorn Ridge.

06:13.666 --> 06:14.530
Right.

06:17.419 --> 06:18.579
Can I have the keys
to the Bronco back?

06:18.796 --> 06:20.161
Nope. I'm leaving.

06:21.465 --> 06:23.330
What do you want me to do
with the kid in the cell?

06:24.802 --> 06:27.259
Has anyone confirmed
that he's Donna's son?

06:27.471 --> 06:28.256
No.

06:28.973 --> 06:30.053
Then nothing.

06:34.937 --> 06:35.892
[door closes]

06:52.413 --> 06:54.369
[grunts]

06:56.125 --> 06:59.743
[Donna] Came out after my group
and-- and it was on fire,

06:59.962 --> 07:02.749
and the fire department said
that someone broke the window

07:02.965 --> 07:06.207
and threw a Molotov cocktail
inside, so...

07:15.102 --> 07:18.435
Well, my patient's suicide,
um...

07:18.647 --> 07:20.353
it was because of me.

07:24.695 --> 07:26.651
Have you ever heard of
transference?

07:30.951 --> 07:33.442
This patient hasn't made
their last four sessions,

07:33.662 --> 07:35.243
so I'm completely in the dark

07:35.456 --> 07:36.662
as to their state of mind
right now.

07:40.586 --> 07:42.998
[Vic] Have you totally lost
your damn mind?

07:43.923 --> 07:45.538
Where the hell did you go
last night?

07:46.717 --> 07:48.582
Cumberland County morgue.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.929
They called me in
to ID. a Jane Doe.

07:51.764 --> 07:55.677
Uh, blond, 5'6",
45, 50 years old.

07:57.978 --> 07:58.842
Shit.

08:00.272 --> 08:01.432
I'm so sorry, Walt.

08:02.358 --> 08:03.598
It wasn't her.

08:06.403 --> 08:07.859
What does this look like?

08:09.740 --> 08:12.026
Um...Red Stripe.

08:12.284 --> 08:14.275
Same brand
that Duncan Butler was drinking

08:14.495 --> 08:15.985
when we visited him
yesterday.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.206
So then I was right.

08:21.418 --> 08:22.874
It was one of her patients.

08:23.087 --> 08:25.544
You go to his house.
l'll head to his work.

08:25.756 --> 08:26.711
No way.

08:28.384 --> 08:29.669
I'm not letting you
back behind the wheel again.

08:29.885 --> 08:30.874
Give me the keys.

08:31.720 --> 08:32.800
I'm fine, Vic.

08:42.982 --> 08:45.143
What the hell
have you gotten me into?

08:45.359 --> 08:46.474
I would be happy to file

08:46.694 --> 08:48.434
a police report for you,
Standing Bear.

08:48.654 --> 08:49.734
I almost got killed.

08:49.947 --> 08:50.936
That is on you.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.654
It was a good plan.

08:53.617 --> 08:54.572
Good?

08:54.785 --> 08:56.070
You told me
I was retrieving

08:56.286 --> 08:57.947
a single antique
piece of pottery

08:58.163 --> 09:00.119
from a residence
where nobody was home.

09:00.332 --> 09:01.663
But not a single part
of that description

09:01.875 --> 09:03.411
-turned out to be true.
-What do you mean?

09:03.627 --> 09:06.289
-You couldn't find the pot?
-I found hundreds of pots!

09:06.547 --> 09:08.663
It might've looked
like a residence from outside,

09:08.882 --> 09:10.793
but inside it was
some kind of warehouse

09:11.010 --> 09:12.921
filled with counterfeit
Indian artifacts,

09:13.137 --> 09:14.593
and somebody was home.

09:14.847 --> 09:16.007
Can you describe him?

09:16.640 --> 09:19.097
I only remember the shotgun
he pointed at my head.

09:19.810 --> 09:20.890
What else?

09:21.895 --> 09:23.396
So, no apology.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.436
[telephone ringing]

09:25.607 --> 09:27.108
I got to take this.

09:27.484 --> 09:29.816
[sighs] Yeah.

09:31.155 --> 09:32.440
Anybody get hurt?

09:33.115 --> 09:33.979
Good.

09:35.284 --> 09:37.650
Well, we finally got an excuse
to get inside.

09:38.454 --> 09:40.740
All right.
Yeah. I'm on my way.

09:42.207 --> 09:44.459
Well, Standing Bear,
I got to go.

09:44.668 --> 09:47.000
Apparently there was
a home invasion last night.

09:47.212 --> 09:50.375
Some broken pottery,
a couple shots fired.

09:51.050 --> 09:53.086
Someone said
they even saw Hector.

09:57.973 --> 10:00.134
You knew somebody would be
in that house last night.

10:00.350 --> 10:01.886
You sent me there
to cause a disturbance

10:02.102 --> 10:03.683
so you could enter the house
legally.

10:04.354 --> 10:06.606
I told you
it was a good plan.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.047
Duncan?

10:38.514 --> 10:41.472
-Can I help you?
-Uh, yeah.
We're looking for Duncan Butler.

10:42.184 --> 10:43.674
Uh, maybe you should talk
to Brent.

10:44.061 --> 10:45.551
-This way?
-Yeah.

10:49.233 --> 10:50.518
[Brent]
Can I see some |.D.?

10:52.277 --> 10:53.528
Duncan has the day off.

10:53.737 --> 10:54.977
Call him at home.
I'm sure he'll see you.

10:55.197 --> 10:56.562
We went to his house.
He wasn't there.

10:56.782 --> 10:58.818
-So we figured he'd be here.
-Well, he's not.

10:59.034 --> 11:01.116
Look, I don't know what you guys
want to talk to Duncan about,

11:01.328 --> 11:02.909
but he served his country
for four years.

11:03.122 --> 11:04.828
I think the least the rest of us
can do is cut him some slack.

11:05.040 --> 11:08.203
Really? We want to talk to him
about a van that got firebombed.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.454
[scoffs] I see.
Just because he served in Iraq

11:10.671 --> 11:12.332
means he's the one
who bombed a car.

11:12.548 --> 11:14.504
-Yeah, sort of.
-And the rest of us have no
responsibility

11:14.716 --> 11:16.707
to help people like Duncan
after all they've done for us?

11:16.927 --> 11:20.010
Brent, I appreciate
what you're doing for Duncan,

11:20.222 --> 11:22.008
but this is not
just about a firebombed van.

11:22.224 --> 11:23.339
There's a woman missing.

11:23.559 --> 11:25.095
Now, she was also trying
to help Duncan.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.972
I don't know if he's done
anything wrong or if he's hurt her,

11:28.188 --> 11:29.974
but I do need to speak
to him.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.021
Now, he doesn't have
the day off today, does he?

11:32.234 --> 11:34.475
-He just didn't show up.
-Duncan is a good guy.

11:34.695 --> 11:37.402
Brent, when we spoke to you
the other day,

11:37.614 --> 11:40.481
you provided an alibi for Duncan
for the bombing and abduction.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.737
Would you swear to that
in front of a judge?

11:45.122 --> 11:46.532
Sometimes Duncan has bad days.

11:46.748 --> 11:49.615
He doesn't make a day, and l...
l clock in and out for him.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.993
This happen on the dates
we asked about?

11:55.048 --> 11:56.333
Yeah.

11:56.550 --> 11:58.040
You got any idea
where he is?

11:58.594 --> 11:59.629
No.

11:59.845 --> 12:02.632
His wife wasn't home either.
Do you know where she works?

12:02.848 --> 12:04.088
His wife?

12:04.308 --> 12:06.094
His wife hasn't been home
since last November.

12:06.310 --> 12:07.345
She left him.

12:12.858 --> 12:13.973
[Walt]
Okay. Thanks, Ferg.

12:15.027 --> 12:18.144
Duncan's wife filed
divorce papers in January.

is in Tensleep.

12:21.909 --> 12:22.944
I'm no psychiatrist,

12:23.160 --> 12:24.366
but Duncan seems
delusional.

12:24.578 --> 12:25.567
His wife leaves him

12:25.787 --> 12:27.163
and he keeps her stuff
laying around for months?

come out here.

12:39.301 --> 12:40.837
I'd rather not say
over the phone.

12:41.053 --> 12:42.463
Where should I meet you?

12:42.679 --> 12:44.010
I'll text you the address.

12:44.223 --> 12:47.056
I don't have a cellphone.
Text it through to Vic's.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.508
Oh, you, uh, you with Vic?

12:51.021 --> 12:52.101
Hey, Eamonn.

12:54.024 --> 12:55.480
Hi.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.892
Okay. Send me
that address.

13:03.825 --> 13:04.860
I'm not going out there.

13:05.494 --> 13:06.199
No.

13:06.745 --> 13:10.033
No, you're going to Tensleep
to look for Duncan's ex-wife.

13:11.083 --> 13:13.324
You didn't hire Eamonn,
did you?

13:13.543 --> 13:14.794
Nope.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.459
What was that call about?

13:16.672 --> 13:18.162
If we're wrong about Duncan,

13:18.382 --> 13:20.668
we need to reconsider
Walker Browning.

13:20.884 --> 13:23.261
We still haven't ruled him out
as a suspect.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.176
Eamonn may know
where he's hiding.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.803
I thought you said
I was right

13:27.015 --> 13:28.630
about it being
one of Donna's patients.

13:28.850 --> 13:30.010
No, you said that.

13:32.521 --> 13:35.604
I'm gonna need my keys back.

[camera shutter clicks,
door opens]

14:46.762 --> 14:48.548
You'd better not be messing
with me.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.758
Hello, Mathias.

14:52.059 --> 14:55.472
So, I went and checked on that
house you broke into last night.

14:55.687 --> 14:57.894
-It's hardly a warehouse.
-What do you mean?

14:58.106 --> 15:01.314
Only artifacts I saw were
two bowls and a cooking pot.

15:01.526 --> 15:03.141
And they were broken.

15:03.362 --> 15:05.899
One was thrown, the other two
were blown up by a shotgun.

15:06.114 --> 15:07.365
I know what I saw.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.189
They're filing
an insurance claim.

15:10.035 --> 15:12.196
-How much?
-$120,000.

15:13.330 --> 15:15.036
For counterfeit clay pots?

15:15.248 --> 15:19.082
Not counterfeit.
Authentic, but black market.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.413
We believe that someone's
systematically been stealing

15:21.630 --> 15:23.120
and selling
our people's history.

15:23.340 --> 15:24.830
Like that pot
I sent you for?

15:25.050 --> 15:27.291
That was stolen from
Adele Chapman's house last week.

15:27.969 --> 15:30.255
Instead, you drove
their operation underground.

15:39.398 --> 15:40.808
Hector has that effect
on people.

15:40.982 --> 15:41.937
Uh-huh.

15:42.943 --> 15:44.649
I'm actually a little concerned
that Hector

15:44.861 --> 15:47.147
doesn't fully appreciate
the nature of our arrangement.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.737
He's supposed to be an asset
in fighting crime,

15:49.950 --> 15:51.815
and he's supposed to be
stealthy.

15:52.035 --> 15:53.366
He's not supposed to shoot up
the joint

15:53.578 --> 15:54.954
and scare the bad guys
into hiding.

15:55.163 --> 15:56.949
Next time, maybe
you should arm Hector

15:57.165 --> 15:59.872
with a little more information
about what you expect from him.

16:01.378 --> 16:02.367
Okay.

16:03.171 --> 16:05.127
Here's what I expect
from him.

16:05.340 --> 16:08.503
He's gonna watch that house,
see who comes and goes,

16:08.718 --> 16:09.878
and follow them.

16:10.095 --> 16:11.676
I need to find
where that merchandise went.

16:11.888 --> 16:13.970
Now, last night
was strike one.

16:14.182 --> 16:15.388
You get one more chance

16:15.600 --> 16:17.591
or I send my blood samples
to the FBI.

16:30.574 --> 16:32.155
That is not
how strikes work.

16:32.367 --> 16:34.733
I never had much patience
for baseball.

16:47.048 --> 16:48.254
You have the code?

16:48.467 --> 16:50.128
Nope.
We got to climb.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.595
You sure it's worth it?

16:52.804 --> 16:53.919
No.

16:54.139 --> 16:55.800
But this morning,
a shutoff engineer

16:56.016 --> 16:58.007
from the Newett oil field
came in to report

16:58.226 --> 17:00.933
that some cranky cowboy came
sniffing around his work site.

17:01.146 --> 17:03.387
Same work site where you and I
questioned Walker Browning.

17:03.607 --> 17:04.642
I wasn't that cranky.

17:05.484 --> 17:06.519
Yeah.

17:07.235 --> 17:09.226
Well, shortly after that,
Sheriff Wilkins announced

17:09.446 --> 17:10.481
he'd be working from home.

17:12.908 --> 17:14.068
Sheriff Wilkins lives here?

17:14.284 --> 17:15.273
Yep.

17:16.495 --> 17:18.326
You think Walker
Browning's here?

17:18.538 --> 17:19.823
It's just a hunch,

17:20.040 --> 17:21.871
but Sheriff Wilkins
doesn't ever work from home.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.241
Nobody there
to laugh at his jokes.

17:27.464 --> 17:28.795
[metal rattling]

17:29.007 --> 17:30.713
[grunts]

17:43.980 --> 17:45.311
Hey there, Sheriff.

17:49.861 --> 17:51.601
Sound travels
in the mountains.

17:53.281 --> 17:56.148
Heard that old Bronco of yours
all the way up here.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.776
Why don't you come on up
for a chat?

18:00.497 --> 18:02.909
Tell your little, uh,
deputy friend to join you.

18:05.085 --> 18:06.791
Hey, Eamonn,
you're not fooling anybody.

18:07.003 --> 18:08.584
I can see you right there.

18:17.806 --> 18:18.420
Yeah.

18:30.151 --> 18:32.688
I'm curious that you recognize
the sound of my truck.

18:33.530 --> 18:34.861
You been driving it
recently?

18:35.073 --> 18:37.155
Man, you are so literal.

18:37.367 --> 18:39.858
[sighs] You got me there.
That's great detective work.

18:40.078 --> 18:41.579
I didn't actually hear it.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.530
This, uh, place has
these closed-circuit TV channels

18:44.791 --> 18:47.373
[grunts] that show the comings
and goings at the gate.

18:47.586 --> 18:48.826
Where is she?

18:49.838 --> 18:52.955
Did you lose her?
After all that trouble?

18:53.174 --> 18:54.675
Answer me, Walker.

18:54.884 --> 18:57.011
I don't know where Gab is.
I didn't take her.

18:57.220 --> 19:01.133
Took off after you ambushed
me, killed Trot.

19:01.391 --> 19:03.723
That's not what happened,
and you know that.

19:06.104 --> 19:08.095
You the sniper, huh?

19:08.356 --> 19:11.974
You know, hiding in the woods
just like you were doing here?

19:13.069 --> 19:14.980
For your sake,
I sure as hell hope

19:15.196 --> 19:16.322
you got a warrant
this time, Walt.

19:16.531 --> 19:17.611
I do not.

19:18.325 --> 19:22.694
Walker invited us in,
so this is all perfectly legal.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.285
Us?

19:25.081 --> 19:26.196
You and Eamonn?

19:26.416 --> 19:28.782
Are you two a couple now?
[laughs]

19:29.002 --> 19:31.539
Sheriff, I think this
is just a big miscommunication.

19:31.755 --> 19:34.167
Well, we can straighten that
right out, can't we, Eamonn?

19:35.091 --> 19:37.127
Escort this son of a bitch
back to Absaroka County.

19:37.344 --> 19:38.504
I'm not leaving.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.340
You know what? Scratch that.
Arrest the sheriff.

19:41.556 --> 19:43.012
-He hasn't done anything.
-Arrest him!

19:43.224 --> 19:44.213
There's no need.

19:54.069 --> 19:56.435
Get up.
Get off me!

19:57.614 --> 19:59.024
You attacked me in my home,

19:59.240 --> 20:01.697
and then you took Donna 'cause
you saw what she meant to me!

20:02.786 --> 20:05.778
I really like the idea
of hurting you, Walt.

20:05.997 --> 20:08.909
But I really don't give a shit
about hurting your feelings.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.992
It was you! Say it!
Get off!

20:12.253 --> 20:14.630
All right, Longmire. That's it.
You're under arrest!

20:14.839 --> 20:15.954
Say it!
Say it!

20:16.174 --> 20:17.755
If I shot you,
I would've shot you dead.

20:17.926 --> 20:20.884
-I think you thought you did.
-Oh, I would've made sure.

20:23.181 --> 20:24.921
[chuckles]

20:44.828 --> 20:46.910
You may as well go, too, Eamonn,
you piece of shit.

20:48.623 --> 20:52.787
I expect your resignation
on my desk inside the hour.

21:00.552 --> 21:02.258
[Eamonn]
He thought the "she" was Gab.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.131
Yep.

21:04.806 --> 21:07.047
So, he's a pretty good liar.

21:07.267 --> 21:08.598
He is.

21:10.103 --> 21:14.722
But this time...this time,
he's telling the truth.

21:16.359 --> 21:18.566
He would've killed me
if he had the chance.

21:23.533 --> 21:25.069
Why don't you come work
for me?

21:27.370 --> 21:29.076
Yeah, that sounds great.

21:29.289 --> 21:32.281
Leap from one unstable,
hostile work environment

21:32.500 --> 21:33.330
to another.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.247
But thanks for the offer.

21:42.385 --> 21:44.546
I'm sorry
I got you fired.

21:44.763 --> 21:47.379
Yeah. Just a matter of time
before I left.

21:48.057 --> 21:50.434
Hard to work for a boss you
don't respect.

21:52.270 --> 21:54.306
You really should get that
checked out.

21:56.107 --> 21:58.974
You don't want to bleed to death
in Sheriff Wilkins' county.

22:06.201 --> 22:07.031
How was everything?

22:07.243 --> 22:08.858
Ah.
It was a little rare.

22:10.413 --> 22:14.076
I am sorry to hear that.
I will let the kitchen know.

22:16.211 --> 22:17.291
[grunts]

22:17.545 --> 22:19.206
Hey, buddy, break it up!

22:19.464 --> 22:21.295
Get down! Hey, back off!
Back off!

22:21.549 --> 22:23.756
-I'm making a citizen's arrest.
-Who the hell are you?

22:23.968 --> 22:25.424
-Get off me!
-Shut up! Shut up, man!

22:25.637 --> 22:27.218
Sir, please, just--
just calm down.

22:27.430 --> 22:28.385
I can call the sheriff.

22:28.598 --> 22:30.554
No, no. No need.
I got this.

22:31.184 --> 22:33.470
Hey, you, come here.
Sweetheart, come here.

22:33.728 --> 22:34.968
Come on!
Get over here!

22:39.150 --> 22:40.856
Here.

22:41.069 --> 22:44.061
Zip his wrists up
real tight, okay?

22:44.280 --> 22:45.736
Don't move.

22:49.911 --> 22:51.117
Jesus.
Come on, come on!

22:51.704 --> 22:52.739
Come on, come on.

22:53.665 --> 22:56.327
Okay, come on.
Get up! Get up!

22:58.086 --> 22:59.951
Stay back.
Everybody stay where they are.

23:00.171 --> 23:01.672
This'll be over real soon.

23:08.221 --> 23:10.587
[Ferg] The abductor
is a male Caucasian in his 30s.

23:10.807 --> 23:13.970
He is driving a red pickup
truck, Ram 2500.

23:14.185 --> 23:15.345
You got any plate numbers?

23:16.396 --> 23:18.978
County one-six,
license number four-two.

23:19.190 --> 23:21.806
County one-six,
license four-two.

23:22.026 --> 23:23.436
Got it. Will you run
those plates for me?

23:23.653 --> 23:25.143
That's what I'm doing.
Hold on.

23:26.906 --> 23:29.147
Ferg, this guy seems unhinged.
He might hurt someone.

23:29.367 --> 23:31.358
I do not think it is wise
to wait for the cavalry.

23:31.578 --> 23:33.864
-I can run him off the road.
-Don't, Henry.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.536
Not until we know
who we're dealing with.

23:35.748 --> 23:36.954
Which is...

23:37.709 --> 23:38.869
Duncan Butler.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.253
Holy shit.
Are you sure, Ferg?

23:41.421 --> 23:43.628
Truck was registered to him
just last year.

23:44.549 --> 23:45.629
[siren wailing]

23:46.509 --> 23:48.045
-I don't know
who you think I am --
-Look, I know who you are.

23:48.261 --> 23:49.751
-I know what you did.
-I didn't do anything!

23:49.971 --> 23:51.836
-Bu||shit!
-Oh!

23:52.056 --> 23:53.136
[tires screech]

23:55.727 --> 23:57.263
[Duncan] Jesus, Officer!
Watch where you're going!

23:57.478 --> 23:58.729
I almost hit you!

23:58.980 --> 24:00.140
Get on the ground!

24:00.356 --> 24:01.311
Get out.

24:01.482 --> 24:03.438
I got him!
He can tell us where Donna is.

24:03.651 --> 24:04.731
Duncan, get on the ground!

24:04.944 --> 24:06.354
-Help me!
-Hey.

24:06.571 --> 24:08.311
Stay back.
This is police business.

24:08.531 --> 24:09.566
-Get out.
-Let go of the hostage

24:09.782 --> 24:11.067
and put your weapon down.

24:11.576 --> 24:12.531
What?

24:12.744 --> 24:13.950
Oh, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

24:14.162 --> 24:15.902
l arrested him, all right?
Citizen's arrest.

24:16.122 --> 24:18.909
[grunts]

24:19.250 --> 24:21.286
Duncan, what the hell
is going on?

24:21.461 --> 24:22.792
He's the guy who took Donna!

24:23.004 --> 24:25.040
-Which one of these guys
is the bad guy?
-I don't know.

24:27.050 --> 24:28.881
Oh, shit.
Igot him!

24:29.093 --> 24:30.799
[grunts]
Get down!

24:31.304 --> 24:33.465
Get down!
[breathing heavily]

24:33.681 --> 24:35.137
Okay.

24:37.352 --> 24:38.341
[door closes]

24:38.895 --> 24:40.510
I don't know why you're talking
to me, all right?

24:40.730 --> 24:42.095
Randal's the one who took Donna.

24:42.941 --> 24:44.397
What makes you think that?

24:45.526 --> 24:47.778
I've seen him hanging around
the parking lot,

24:47.987 --> 24:50.364
waiting for Donna
after his group session.

24:50.573 --> 24:52.734
Looking for a little, uh,
one-on-one time,

24:52.951 --> 24:54.236
if you know what I mean.

24:55.536 --> 24:56.992
What were you waiting for?

24:57.246 --> 24:58.577
Come again?

24:58.790 --> 25:01.327
Were you waiting
for some one-on-one time, too?

25:02.502 --> 25:03.617
No.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.872
I was just looking
after her is all.

25:06.089 --> 25:07.499
Donna and me,
we have a connection.

25:09.884 --> 25:14.469
She has this ability...
to s-- see right through you.

25:14.681 --> 25:17.093
Next thing you know, you're just
pouring your heart out,

25:17.308 --> 25:19.515
feeling things you
never felt before.

25:21.145 --> 25:23.602
If she's that good,
why'd you stop going to therapy?

25:24.357 --> 25:26.188
You missed your last few
appointments.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.854
We had an awkward session.

25:29.112 --> 25:31.228
[Vic] What exactly happened
at your session?

25:32.782 --> 25:34.568
I brought her a stew.

25:37.954 --> 25:41.446
I made it myself from scratch
from a rabbit I shot.

25:42.834 --> 25:44.290
Wow. You shot her a rabbit?

25:44.502 --> 25:45.662
Right?

25:47.213 --> 25:49.625
You know, I never cooked that
stew for nobody but Jean.

25:50.717 --> 25:55.256
It was homemade,
and she just...turned it down.

25:56.389 --> 25:58.675
-How rude.
-Right?

25:58.891 --> 26:03.601
And instead of saying thank you,
she...she asked me

26:03.813 --> 26:06.225
what I thought the nature
of our relationship was.

26:07.567 --> 26:09.649
She went all robotic on me,

26:09.861 --> 26:13.524
insisting that our relationship
was just doctor-patient.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.276
Like she was just toying
with you.

26:15.491 --> 26:16.947
And that's not
the worst part.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.401
I missed a few sessions,
and this bitch sent me a-a bill.

26:19.620 --> 26:20.746
Can you believe that shit?

26:22.832 --> 26:25.164
-|'d have gone ballistic.
-Yeah. I did.

26:25.418 --> 26:26.703
I know.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.705
You recognize
that beer bottle?

26:35.553 --> 26:37.214
Red Stripe.

26:37.430 --> 26:39.546
Only beer I know
comes in a bottle that shape.

26:39.807 --> 26:41.388
I'm a Rainier man myself,

26:41.601 --> 26:44.217
but they don't sell that
in bottles around here, so...

26:46.814 --> 26:49.806
Not very useful
for Molotov cocktails.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.272
[Vic] And, Duncan,
before you say another word,

26:54.489 --> 26:56.946
you need to know your boss isn't
backing up your story anymore.

26:57.658 --> 26:59.114
We know that you don't
have an alibi

26:59.327 --> 27:00.908
for the time that that van
went up in flames.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.202
Okay, okay.
Okay. You got me, all right?

27:03.414 --> 27:04.529
It's -- [sighs]

27:05.792 --> 27:07.077
I got anger issues.

27:09.045 --> 27:10.626
Donna and l were
working on that.

27:10.838 --> 27:15.047
And I know it wasn't appropriate
to firebomb her truck.

27:15.259 --> 27:16.339
l was upset.

27:17.929 --> 27:21.797
I needed Donna to know that you
can't treat people like that.

27:22.975 --> 27:26.263
You can't just...
just brush me off.

27:28.022 --> 27:31.059
That stew was homemade.

27:32.527 --> 27:33.983
So where is she, Duncan?

27:34.612 --> 27:35.772
What?

27:35.988 --> 27:37.239
I told you.
Randal has her.

27:38.616 --> 27:40.777
You just admitted to torching
her van.

27:42.078 --> 27:43.614
Yeah, I torched her van,

27:43.830 --> 27:45.946
but I wouldn't do anything
to hurt her.

27:55.675 --> 27:56.881
Hey.

27:57.176 --> 27:59.508
I finally confirmed the ID.
of Andrew Price.

27:59.720 --> 28:02.132
He really is Donna's son.
I talked to her ex.

28:02.348 --> 28:03.463
Okay.

28:03.683 --> 28:07.926
Um, and his dad, Donna's ex,
is a lawyer.

28:08.146 --> 28:09.852
He's pretty pissed
that we're holding his son

28:10.022 --> 28:10.886
without charging him.

28:11.107 --> 28:12.517
You want me to charge him?

28:12.733 --> 28:14.815
No. Uh, no.

28:15.027 --> 28:18.815
Duncan just confessed
to, uh, firebombing Donna's van.

28:19.031 --> 28:22.159
We'll see if that's all he's
done, but you can let Andrew go.

28:29.542 --> 28:32.375
Make sure this is everything.
Sign here, okay?

28:41.512 --> 28:42.922
No, no, no, no.
[Andrew] Hey, who's this?

28:43.139 --> 28:44.219
My mom's old boyfriend?

28:44.432 --> 28:45.512
You can show
yourself out, Andrew.

28:45.725 --> 28:47.261
-You locking me up?
-Yep.

28:47.476 --> 28:49.432
This is insane!
What about this guy?

28:49.687 --> 28:51.894
This guy's pressing charges!
I might even sue your ass!

28:52.148 --> 28:54.389
[Ferg] Whoa.
Sit down.

28:56.319 --> 28:59.732
Hey, Sheriff.
You probably should hear this.

28:59.947 --> 29:00.936
[cellphone beeps]

29:01.157 --> 29:03.148
[Donna]
Hey, Andy. It's Mom.

29:03.367 --> 29:05.779
Uh, no big dealio.
Just checking in.

29:05.995 --> 29:07.485
Look, she never
just checks in,

29:07.705 --> 29:09.946
and I've never heard her say
"dealio" in my life.

29:10.124 --> 29:13.412
I think something is, like,
actually seriously wrong.

29:13.669 --> 29:15.830
Call log says she called two
hours ago.

29:16.088 --> 29:17.624
I'll have the phone
company trace it.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.665
Here. Write
down your number.

29:21.469 --> 29:23.755
So, that call came in
while Duncan was in custody.

29:23.971 --> 29:25.472
[keypad clicking]

29:25.681 --> 29:27.296
I'm with the Absaroka County
Sheriff's Department.

29:27.516 --> 29:28.551
I need a trace.

29:28.768 --> 29:29.883
Yeah, I'll hold.

29:30.811 --> 29:31.891
Maybe Donna got access
to a phone

29:32.104 --> 29:33.890
after Duncan went
to the Red Pony.

29:34.106 --> 29:37.724
If she was alone, why would she
feel the need to speak in code?

29:37.944 --> 29:40.856
He only admitted to the bombing,
not the abduction.

29:41.072 --> 29:42.687
So maybe Duncan was
telling the truth

29:42.907 --> 29:45.023
and the bomber and the abductor
are not the same person.

29:45.243 --> 29:47.700
You think there's a third
person out there?

29:47.912 --> 29:48.901
Nope.

29:51.165 --> 29:53.076
You call me as soon
as that trace comes through.

29:55.670 --> 29:56.534
[door closes]

29:59.382 --> 30:01.794
[Vic]
Tamar Smith was in the hospital.
She's got an alibi.

30:02.009 --> 30:04.466
[Walt] For the bombing.
Not the abduction.

30:05.805 --> 30:08.968
According to Donna, Tamar's
suicide attempt is related

30:09.183 --> 30:11.344
to transference issues
with Donna.

30:11.602 --> 30:13.638
Think how she reacted when
she heard Donna was missing.

30:13.854 --> 30:16.311
-Nothing.
-Yeah, and Duncan freaked out.

30:16.524 --> 30:17.684
Right.

30:17.900 --> 30:19.231
Tamar was more concerned

30:19.443 --> 30:22.105
that I looked like
her commanding officer.

30:48.472 --> 30:50.053
[cellphone rings]

30:53.644 --> 30:54.850
Hey, Ferg.

30:56.022 --> 30:57.011
Yeah.

30:57.815 --> 30:58.725
Okay.

31:00.443 --> 31:03.059
Phone company confirms that
Donna's call came from here.

31:21.297 --> 31:22.377
Vic.

31:24.300 --> 31:25.289
Shit.

31:28.888 --> 31:30.594
I'm so sorry, Walt.
It's not your fault.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.307
She was here.
I didn't see this.

31:32.516 --> 31:34.973
I didn't look here.
At least we know she's alive.

31:35.186 --> 31:37.518
We just got to figure out
where Tamar took her.

31:55.873 --> 31:57.329
[man]
Excuse me, ma'am.

31:57.541 --> 31:58.792
Looks like you could use
a little air.

31:59.001 --> 32:00.411
-Back up, asshole.
-Whoa.

32:04.131 --> 32:06.668
God damn it!
What the hell's wrong with you?!

32:06.884 --> 32:07.964
I'm trying to tell you
your tire's low!

32:08.177 --> 32:10.088
Do I stutter?!
Back off!

32:14.308 --> 32:16.390
[water running]

32:21.315 --> 32:23.146
[horn honking]

32:31.867 --> 32:32.982
Let's go!

32:34.495 --> 32:36.406
[pounding on door]
Yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming.

32:36.622 --> 32:37.702
Come on!

32:39.875 --> 32:40.864
-Hang on.
-Let's go!

32:41.085 --> 32:42.746
-Yes, okay, okay, okay.
-Now!

32:42.962 --> 32:44.543
-Okay.
-Come on.

32:48.175 --> 32:49.039
Yeah.

32:49.260 --> 32:50.670
Yeah, we heard it
on the evening news,

32:50.886 --> 32:52.751
but you got to keep putting that
information out there

32:52.972 --> 32:54.007
until we find her.

32:55.266 --> 32:57.006
Yeah.
I appreciate it.

33:05.276 --> 33:07.062
[man on radio] The Absaroka
Sheriff's Department

33:07.278 --> 33:08.939
is looking for information
on the whereabouts

33:09.155 --> 33:13.524
of local woman Tamar Smith,
a Caucasian in her early 30s.

33:13.701 --> 33:14.861
Ms. Smith is wanted
in conjunction

33:15.077 --> 33:16.362
with the possible abduction

33:16.579 --> 33:19.537
of Dr. Donna Monaghan
of Sheridan, Wyoming.

33:19.748 --> 33:21.488
The sheriff's department is--

33:21.709 --> 33:23.665
[rock music playing on radio]

33:36.098 --> 33:38.054
[tires screech]

33:38.267 --> 33:39.427
[radio shuts off]

33:44.940 --> 33:46.931
You know you're
not really a ghost.

33:47.151 --> 33:49.938
You can't just run into traffic.

33:51.405 --> 33:52.645
What are you doing out here?

33:57.369 --> 33:58.825
I will not be needing this
anymore.

34:00.873 --> 34:03.330
-Why not?
-Because I will be in jail.

34:04.376 --> 34:05.832
Are you backing out
on our deal?

34:06.086 --> 34:07.246
lam.

34:08.297 --> 34:09.662
Take me to the feds.

34:10.591 --> 34:11.831
Are you serious?

34:12.176 --> 34:14.337
I will not be manipulated
or exploited anymore.

34:14.553 --> 34:16.464
I would rather be
back in prison.

34:18.682 --> 34:19.637
All right.

34:19.850 --> 34:21.386
If that's how you feel.

34:21.602 --> 34:25.811
It is.
And I am sorry.

34:26.023 --> 34:28.560
I realize this puts you
in a difficult position.

34:28.776 --> 34:30.767
Me?
Why do you figure that?

34:32.571 --> 34:34.232
You told me
you were having a tough time

34:34.448 --> 34:36.609
getting people on the res
to trust you.

34:41.205 --> 34:43.537
I imagine that will become
even more difficult

34:43.749 --> 34:46.206
when they learn that you are
the one that arrested Hector.

34:47.253 --> 34:49.835
Do you think people will thank
you for sending their folk hero

34:50.047 --> 34:51.036
to the white man's prison?

34:51.882 --> 34:53.338
lam not so sure.

34:57.805 --> 34:59.341
What do you want,
Henry?

35:01.892 --> 35:05.259
I would like to renegotiate
the terms of our arrangement.

35:08.482 --> 35:09.597
[man on radio]
The sheriff's department

35:09.817 --> 35:11.102
is still asking residents

35:11.318 --> 35:13.400
to be on the lookout
for Dr. Donna Monaghan.

35:13.612 --> 35:16.479
The Sheridan resident
has been missing for three days.

35:16.699 --> 35:19.657
The sheriff is also looking
for a silver Subaru Forester.

35:19.868 --> 35:22.405
[radio turns off]
I'm so stupid.

35:22.621 --> 35:25.112
The media's gonna twist this
into some kind of sex scandal.

35:25.332 --> 35:27.243
They're going to say
I'm a crazy lesbian lover

35:27.459 --> 35:28.960
who just fell off
the deep end.

35:29.169 --> 35:31.626
No, they won't,
because I won't let them.

35:32.506 --> 35:34.371
I should never have let you make
that call to your son.

35:34.842 --> 35:36.833
You let me make that call
because you care about me.

35:38.095 --> 35:39.460
I know that.

35:39.680 --> 35:41.170
And I care about you.

35:41.432 --> 35:44.048
[sighs] But now they're gonna
come find me.

35:45.394 --> 35:47.134
Look, Tamar,
I'm gonna say something

35:47.354 --> 35:49.470
as a friend,
not a therapist, okay?

35:51.567 --> 35:53.307
Don't you think
that on some level,

35:53.527 --> 35:55.108
you want this
whole thing to end?

35:56.280 --> 35:58.236
I mean, you have no escape plan,
there's nowhere to go,

35:58.449 --> 36:00.531
-there's nothing you can do.
-| just need to think.

36:02.119 --> 36:05.486
Let's just try to figure a way
out of this together, okay?

36:06.165 --> 36:07.871
I think that we should go
to the police

36:08.083 --> 36:09.698
and you should
just turn yourself in.

36:09.918 --> 36:12.295
l-l don't think it's
gonna be that bad.

36:12.504 --> 36:15.371
Look, I will tell them that you
were only trying to help me.

36:17.968 --> 36:19.174
You will?

36:19.386 --> 36:20.375
Yes.

36:21.555 --> 36:24.012
So...
[sighs]

36:24.224 --> 36:25.839
Basically,
I just have to trust you?

36:26.894 --> 36:27.929
Yes.

36:31.607 --> 36:33.188
Well, a few weeks ago
in session,

36:33.400 --> 36:35.561
you said that I was placing
too much trust in you.

36:36.904 --> 36:38.314
Well, this is different.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.440
It sure is.

36:45.496 --> 36:49.205
How am I supposed to trust you
when you do shit like this?

37:12.314 --> 37:14.350
I think this ends
tonight's session.

37:25.285 --> 37:27.537
-Where'd she go?
-Around the side of the building.

37:27.746 --> 37:29.031
To use the bathroom,
I guess.

37:29.248 --> 37:30.579
Can we see the video?

37:30.791 --> 37:32.406
I only got one camera,
and it's to keep people

37:32.626 --> 37:33.911
from helping themselves
to free gas.

37:34.128 --> 37:35.789
I never thought I'd need one
on the restroom.

37:36.004 --> 37:37.835
Do you know if this woman
was alone?

37:38.048 --> 37:39.584
I don't know anything
about her.

37:39.800 --> 37:41.131
She went a little psycho
on the guy,

37:41.343 --> 37:42.924
and he came in here
to tell me about it.

37:43.137 --> 37:45.594
Before I could go and talk to
her, she peeled off in the car.

37:45.806 --> 37:46.841
Which direction?

37:47.057 --> 37:48.467
Uh, right on up the hill.

37:52.104 --> 37:54.220
I suppose that's the least
of her crimes.

37:55.607 --> 37:59.441
Man, those things are a pain
in the ass to fold back up.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.154
-What are you looking for?
-Lake.

38:01.363 --> 38:03.069
Pretty sure there's
one nearby.

38:03.282 --> 38:04.772
Foley Lake's
right up that way.

38:04.992 --> 38:05.856
Show me where.

38:06.076 --> 38:07.816
Uh, right there.

38:08.036 --> 38:09.697
What's so special
about Foley Lake?

38:09.913 --> 38:12.450
[man] It's named
for one of Custer's soldiers.

38:12.666 --> 38:15.749
-Story is he had some relative --
-Tamar had a picture of the lake.

38:16.545 --> 38:17.830
[Vic]
Where?

38:22.134 --> 38:24.045
At her house
when we talked to her.

38:24.303 --> 38:25.383
I didn't see it.

38:26.263 --> 38:28.049
It came from the drawer.

38:28.307 --> 38:30.013
Somebody's getting
his memory back.

38:30.851 --> 38:32.387
You think that's
where Tamar's headed?

38:33.145 --> 38:34.555
It's worth a look.

38:42.613 --> 38:44.695
You really think
there are any houses out here?

38:45.532 --> 38:47.068
[Walt]
I see two docks.

38:48.076 --> 38:49.202
One there.

38:49.745 --> 38:51.531
One back there.

38:52.247 --> 38:55.239
Chances are each one belongs
to a house.

38:58.837 --> 39:00.702
There's no boats
at either of them.

39:00.923 --> 39:03.005
We should probably
check them out anyway.

39:03.217 --> 39:05.128
Let's just do a
quick recon pass,

39:05.344 --> 39:06.925
meet back up on the other side.

39:21.819 --> 39:23.650
How do you think
he's really doing?

39:23.862 --> 39:27.275
-Walt?
-He seems a little off.

39:27.491 --> 39:28.947
Yeah.
Well, he got shot.

39:29.201 --> 39:30.281
And hit in the head.

39:30.494 --> 39:32.109
[sighs]

39:35.415 --> 39:36.996
Just give him time.

39:44.758 --> 39:46.294
[Ferg] Do you think
he'd even be able to deal

39:46.552 --> 39:49.339
with having another woman
he cares about die?

39:49.888 --> 39:51.674
Let's hope
we don't have to find out.

41:18.435 --> 41:19.424
Tamar!

41:20.270 --> 41:21.225
Tamar!

41:22.856 --> 41:24.892
You need to come out of there
right now.

41:26.401 --> 41:29.893
Come out slowly
with your hands over your head.

41:33.450 --> 41:34.565
[Donna]
Walt, it's me.

41:34.826 --> 41:37.693
I'm okay.
Just -- Just drop your weapon.

41:39.831 --> 41:40.820
Donna?

41:41.041 --> 41:42.531
Just please
put the gun down.

41:45.128 --> 41:47.039
You -- You have to trust me, okay?
Now just...

41:47.255 --> 41:48.870
Put down the weapon.

41:58.976 --> 42:00.011
Okay.

42:00.227 --> 42:01.592
I put it down.

42:22.374 --> 42:25.116
[door creaks]

43:01.913 --> 43:02.777
-Drop the gun!
-Drop it!

43:02.998 --> 43:03.908
Easy!

43:05.417 --> 43:06.452
Everybody easy.

43:06.668 --> 43:08.204
I told you
we couldn't trust him!

43:08.420 --> 43:10.376
I don't want to shoot.
but I will if I have to.

43:10.589 --> 43:11.499
Now drop it!

43:11.715 --> 43:13.046
Don't yell, Walt, okay?

43:13.258 --> 43:14.964
Please just lower your voice.

43:15.927 --> 43:17.633
You were supposed to leave
the gun outside.

43:18.513 --> 43:19.923
-You lied to me.
-You shot me.

43:20.140 --> 43:22.597
Was I supposed to trust you?
Now let Donna go.

43:22.851 --> 43:25.217
-I can't let you hurt
Dr. Monaghan.
-I won't.

43:25.479 --> 43:27.435
-I'm trying to protect her.
-Bullshit!

43:33.737 --> 43:34.567
Tamar.

43:35.489 --> 43:38.947
I do not want to hurt
Dr. Monaghan or you.

43:39.159 --> 43:41.366
But I also don't want you
to hurt her.

43:41.578 --> 43:42.408
Me?

43:43.121 --> 43:44.452
I'm protecting her!

43:44.664 --> 43:47.201
You shot her,
and you kidnapped her.

43:47.417 --> 43:51.035
T-To keep me from
being raped, Walt.

43:52.089 --> 43:53.579
You see, the other day when --

43:53.799 --> 43:55.755
when you took me back
to my house to get some things,

43:55.967 --> 43:57.832
Tamar saw us there
and she saw you,

43:58.053 --> 44:01.216
and she thought you were big
a-and threatening and macho,

44:01.431 --> 44:03.922
and she just got very
worried for me.

44:04.142 --> 44:05.973
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Walt?

44:13.401 --> 44:15.062
Are you in love
with Dr. Monaghan?

44:16.196 --> 44:17.732
-See?
-No, Tamar.

44:17.948 --> 44:19.734
I told you.

44:19.950 --> 44:21.736
This is what everybody
will think!

44:21.952 --> 44:23.567
No, no, they won't.

44:23.787 --> 44:26.153
Walt, this is not
about jealousy.

44:26.373 --> 44:27.829
It is about trauma.

44:29.501 --> 44:31.617
Tamar is a rape victim,
and you are triggering --

44:31.837 --> 44:33.452
Shut up!
No more!

44:33.713 --> 44:34.873
Shut up!

44:36.049 --> 44:38.711
There's a reason that soldiers
don't go to shrinks.

44:38.927 --> 44:41.259
'Cause it just
makes it worse.

44:42.055 --> 44:44.216
I should've kept this
to myself.

44:45.642 --> 44:47.143
No.

44:47.352 --> 44:49.308
But you opened
me up, right?

44:50.230 --> 44:52.061
And all the shit
started coming out of my head,

44:52.274 --> 44:53.764
and it should've
just stayed there.

44:57.112 --> 44:58.522
Was it your C.O.?

44:59.739 --> 45:00.774
Tamar?

45:01.908 --> 45:05.901
The man in the picture that you
showed me who looks like me?

45:06.121 --> 45:07.281
Did he rape you?

45:23.680 --> 45:25.887
He was supposed to
protect us.

45:27.809 --> 45:30.721
Off base, you know
where the enemy is.

45:31.897 --> 45:33.933
[voice breaking]
You know where the danger is.

45:34.399 --> 45:37.357
Back on the F.O.B.,
it was supposed to be safe!

45:41.656 --> 45:45.148
But Captain Frederick...

45:52.500 --> 45:54.832
I never knew
when he was gonna show up.

45:57.672 --> 45:58.832
I'm not like him.

45:59.424 --> 46:00.960
You don't know him!

46:01.676 --> 46:03.212
You don't know
what he's like!

46:08.308 --> 46:11.391
Dr. Monaghan,
you say that you trust this guy.

46:11.811 --> 46:13.472
How well do you
really know him?

46:13.939 --> 46:16.055
Because I thought that I knew
my commanding officer,

46:16.274 --> 46:18.481
but he had all the power,
and he used it against me.

46:18.693 --> 46:21.400
And because of his rank,
nobody listened to me.

46:22.405 --> 46:25.317
Why should I trust
this guy?

46:27.118 --> 46:29.655
You're right, Tamar.

46:30.288 --> 46:31.619
You don't know me.

46:33.208 --> 46:36.200
So let's give Dr. Monaghan
the power.

46:37.629 --> 46:39.290
If you and me
are both trying to protect her,

46:39.464 --> 46:43.082
let's -- let's let her decide
what to do.

46:46.554 --> 46:48.681
Now, I want everybody
to be safe.

46:50.267 --> 46:52.974
So I'm gonna give
Dr. Monaghan my gun.

47:01.820 --> 47:03.026
It's okay, Tamar.

47:04.364 --> 47:06.980
You and I just wanted
Dr. Monaghan to be safe.

47:07.784 --> 47:08.944
Now she is.

47:11.079 --> 47:12.194
You've done yourjob.

47:13.707 --> 47:14.822
Now you can go.

47:18.420 --> 47:20.456
Nothing bad's gonna
happen now, Tamar.

47:52.704 --> 47:53.659
Uh...

47:54.831 --> 47:56.571
Oh. Yeah.

47:56.791 --> 47:57.951
Wow.

47:58.168 --> 47:59.704
[sniffs]
If it makes you feel any better,

47:59.919 --> 48:03.503
I've never really used one
of these things anyway, so...

48:03.757 --> 48:04.746
It, uh...

48:07.010 --> 48:09.046
It does not make me feel
any better now.

48:09.262 --> 48:10.877
[gun clicks]

48:22.609 --> 48:24.975
I'm okay.
I'm going to be fine.

48:27.655 --> 48:28.405
You're okay.

48:28.615 --> 48:30.856
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm okay.
Thank you.

48:31.076 --> 48:32.691
-You sure?
-Yeah.

48:34.788 --> 48:36.028
Listen.

48:37.582 --> 48:40.915
You stay in here,
and you stay low, okay?

48:41.127 --> 48:42.503
Yeah, okay.

48:48.259 --> 48:49.169
Walt?

48:50.678 --> 48:53.294
If you catch her,
don't hurt her, okay?

48:53.515 --> 48:55.051
She's --
She's not a criminal.

48:55.266 --> 48:57.848
She's just deeply
traumatized.

49:00.146 --> 49:01.101
Yeah.

49:52.282 --> 49:53.237
Tamar.

49:59.873 --> 50:01.784
This was my grandpa's place.

50:03.209 --> 50:05.666
It's the last place I felt safe
before I deployed.

50:07.505 --> 50:09.006
Now I'm afraid to go out.

50:10.967 --> 50:12.127
To sleep, even.

50:14.721 --> 50:15.927
You've been through a lot.

50:17.390 --> 50:18.596
So have you.

50:20.018 --> 50:21.383
I'm used to it.

50:30.987 --> 50:32.978
Where am I
supposed to go, sir?

50:35.116 --> 50:36.902
I can't function
out there anymore.

50:37.911 --> 50:40.197
Look at what I did to you
and Dr. Monaghan.

50:42.457 --> 50:43.537
I'm hurting people.

50:46.711 --> 50:47.871
That's not who I am.

50:50.256 --> 50:51.291
Or who I was.

50:58.264 --> 50:59.379
Cuff me.

51:01.601 --> 51:03.387
I don't think
that'll be necessary.

51:03.603 --> 51:05.559
I don't trust myself
anymore, sir.

51:06.689 --> 51:07.599
Please.

51:26.042 --> 51:28.499
When you tell your side
of the story,

51:29.963 --> 51:31.794
people will understand.

51:38.846 --> 51:40.586
Can Ijust have a minute?

51:45.478 --> 51:48.265
I just want to take
one last look at this place.

51:50.650 --> 51:53.266
Try to keep one good memory
in my head.

52:09.836 --> 52:11.076
I'm so sorry.

52:11.754 --> 52:12.743
What for?

52:13.548 --> 52:16.130
Ijust--
I seem to have a knack

52:16.342 --> 52:19.300
for stirring up trouble
in other people's lives, and...

52:20.722 --> 52:21.928
That's not how I see it.

52:26.519 --> 52:28.350
[water splashes]

52:29.188 --> 52:31.019
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Tamar!

52:32.150 --> 52:34.641
[down-tempo music plays]

52:42.702 --> 52:44.738
I don't see her!
I don't see her!

52:46.539 --> 52:47.745
-Is that Walt?!
-Yes!

52:48.750 --> 52:52.208
-What the hell is he doing?!
-He went in to save my patient!
She jumped in!

52:54.756 --> 52:55.620
Shit.

52:57.258 --> 52:58.293
Where is she?!

52:59.677 --> 53:01.383
-No!
-She's there!

53:01.596 --> 53:02.711
Wait, wait, Ferg.

53:05.975 --> 53:07.590
Hold on to me.
Hold on to me.

53:08.978 --> 53:10.218
[grunts]

53:10.480 --> 53:11.970
-Grab me. You got me?
-I got you.

53:12.190 --> 53:14.146
[Ferg]
She's gonna drown him!

53:15.360 --> 53:16.315
I got you.
[Vic] Okay.

53:16.527 --> 53:17.858
Walt, reach for it.

53:18.112 --> 53:20.319
Hold on to me.
Get me. You got me?

53:20.573 --> 53:21.653
-I got you.
-Grab it.

53:21.866 --> 53:22.776
[grunts]
Oh, shit!

53:23.660 --> 53:24.524
Take her.

53:24.744 --> 53:25.984
[oar clatters]

53:35.129 --> 53:39.168
[voices echoing]

53:44.430 --> 53:46.421
[music continues]

53:55.358 --> 53:57.098
Okay.
Let me see if she's...

53:57.318 --> 53:58.524
[Ferg] Is she breathing?
-No.

53:58.736 --> 53:59.942
Pulse?

54:01.030 --> 54:03.271
Nothing.
Okay. Put her on her side.

54:03.533 --> 54:04.693
-Go on the side.
-Ready?

54:04.909 --> 54:05.898
-Okay.
-Come on!

54:06.119 --> 54:07.404
-Breathe, breathe.
-Wa|t. Walt.

54:07.620 --> 54:09.360
-Come on!
-Okay. She's breathing.

54:09.580 --> 54:10.786
Tip her up.
It's all right.

54:11.040 --> 54:12.701
Deep breaths.

54:12.917 --> 54:13.906
Okay. Okay.

54:14.168 --> 54:16.284
Okay.
You're okay.

54:16.504 --> 54:18.836
[Tamar coughing]
You're okay.

54:19.048 --> 54:20.333
[Ferg]
You're all right.

54:21.801 --> 54:24.383
All right. Okay.
Just take some deep breaths.

54:24.595 --> 54:26.722
[voices echoing]

54:26.931 --> 54:30.219
[music continues]
