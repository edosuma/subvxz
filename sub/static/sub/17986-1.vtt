WEBVTT

00:15.449 --> 00:17.418
(car doors shutting)

00:19.387 --> 00:24.392
(foot steps and traffic passing)

00:32.299 --> 00:34.102
- [Diane] In your opinion,

00:34.135 --> 00:37.438
What happened that night
at the Abaddon Hotel?

00:40.741 --> 00:42.376
- I don't know.

00:42.410 --> 00:43.477
- You want to know what I
think happened that night?

00:43.511 --> 00:45.146
I have no idea.

00:45.179 --> 00:49.583
(struggling with door)

01:02.630 --> 01:05.233
- [Voiceover] Breaking
news, just reaching us now.

01:05.266 --> 01:08.469
Tragedy at a Halloween
haunted house in Abaddon.

01:08.502 --> 01:11.105
- To this day, I can't give
you an answer to that question.

01:11.139 --> 01:13.441
- Well, Hell House was a
real tragedy on many levels.

01:13.474 --> 01:14.608
- [Voiceover] From
what we're hearing,

01:14.642 --> 01:16.410
the opening night of
this haunted house tour,

01:16.444 --> 01:17.611
ended in disaster.

01:17.645 --> 01:19.547
Multiple deaths, but
police aren't answering

01:19.580 --> 01:20.714
any of our questions.

01:20.748 --> 01:23.284
- You had older victims
and younger victims,

01:23.317 --> 01:26.720
these are people who are
paying for the scare experience

01:26.754 --> 01:29.590
in a controlled
environments, but in the end,

01:29.623 --> 01:31.225
what they got was total chaos.

01:31.259 --> 01:33.394
- A small abandoned
hotel was transformed

01:33.427 --> 01:35.229
into a haunted attraction.

01:35.263 --> 01:36.464
It was due to run tours

01:36.497 --> 01:38.466
the next few weeks
through Halloween.

01:38.499 --> 01:43.437
(eerie piano music)

01:45.273 --> 01:50.211
(ambulance sirens)

01:50.244 --> 01:51.712
- [Voiceover] We're not sure
if anybody from the company

01:51.745 --> 01:54.682
has made it out alive
as of right now.

01:54.715 --> 01:57.185
Shaking tour-goes appear
to not really know

01:57.218 --> 01:58.752
what was going on either.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.754
- I been waiting on line
for about 5 minutes now,

02:00.788 --> 02:02.756
and I just see all these
bunch of people coming out.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.625
I'm like, "Dude, where do I go?"

02:04.658 --> 02:05.793
- No, we had no idea.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.395
We still don't know.

02:09.396 --> 02:14.402
(footsteps and eerie music)

02:22.276 --> 02:27.281
(door creaking)

02:29.383 --> 02:33.321
(rolling thunder)

02:33.354 --> 02:36.224
- Whenever people ask me
what happened in Hell House,

02:36.257 --> 02:39.960
I tell them, "You watch
the video, you tell me."

02:39.993 --> 02:45.199
(people talking and traffic)

02:47.835 --> 02:50.338
- How many people are
they letting in at a time?

02:50.371 --> 02:52.273
(crowds talking)

02:52.306 --> 02:54.408
It's a long wait.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.280
I think we're next.

02:59.313 --> 03:00.648
It's exciting.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.783
- We've been waiting for you.

03:04.017 --> 03:07.288
I hope you all enjoy your stay.

03:07.321 --> 03:12.326
(eerie music and crowds talking)

03:16.430 --> 03:21.435
(screaming)

04:03.511 --> 04:05.279
- Was that supposed to happen?

04:05.313 --> 04:07.315
- [Voiceover] I don't think so.

04:07.348 --> 04:10.518
Technical difficulties
on opening night.

04:12.386 --> 04:17.291
(eerie music and screaming)

04:23.397 --> 04:28.402
(yelling)

04:57.498 --> 05:02.403
(panicked screaming)

05:25.158 --> 05:30.364
(crashing and banging)

05:31.899 --> 05:35.403
- [Voiceover] We gotta go,
we gotta go, we gotta go!

05:35.436 --> 05:40.441
(crowds screaming and running)

05:45.479 --> 05:46.580
- [Voiceover] Hurry up!

05:46.614 --> 05:47.781
- [Voiceover] Get out of here!

05:47.815 --> 05:50.418
Go, go!

05:52.453 --> 05:57.458
(screaming and sirens)

06:06.166 --> 06:08.168
- [Voiceover] Oh my God!

06:08.201 --> 06:13.073
(screaming)

06:26.454 --> 06:31.459
(sirens)

06:41.201 --> 06:43.170
- Nobody knew what to
make of the YouTube video,

06:43.203 --> 06:45.606
and then the 911 tape leaked and

06:45.639 --> 06:49.477
that just confused
people even more.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.713
- [Voiceover] 911,
what's your emergency?

06:56.850 --> 06:58.218
What's the problem, Miss?

06:58.251 --> 07:00.654
- [Voiceover] I don't know!

07:00.688 --> 07:01.221
There's something--

07:01.254 --> 07:03.423
(static)

07:04.191 --> 07:05.526
- [Voiceover] Is someone hurt?

07:05.559 --> 07:06.860
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.962
- [Voiceover] Please
hurry, I don't want to die.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.931
- [Voiceover] The
cause of death is now

07:10.964 --> 07:14.001
vaguely being blamed on
a severe malfunction.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.936
What exactly
malfunctioned isn't clear,

07:15.969 --> 07:17.971
and authorities aren't saying.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.840
- All we have from that night is

07:19.873 --> 07:23.677
the video the tour-goer
shot uploaded to YouTube

07:23.711 --> 07:25.546
before the police
got ahold of it.

07:25.579 --> 07:28.716
The 911 call was
the only other thing

07:28.749 --> 07:30.551
and, that didn't
really tell us much

07:30.584 --> 07:32.753
of what was going on inside.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.589
Then this photographer,
Martin Cliver comes along,

07:35.623 --> 07:37.925
gets inside the hotel,

07:37.958 --> 07:39.126
takes pictures,

07:39.159 --> 07:41.228
puts it up on the internet.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.130
It starts to raise
some real questions

07:43.163 --> 07:45.833
that the town does
now want answers to.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.267
- The hardest part?

07:47.300 --> 07:50.504
The hardest part was
probably the silence.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.973
Everything was very hush hush.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.274
There were gag orders put on

07:54.307 --> 07:56.977
everyone involved with the case.

07:57.010 --> 08:00.648
Cops, lawyers, even the
families of the victims

08:00.681 --> 08:02.883
were left pretty much
completely in the dark.

08:02.916 --> 08:07.087
It was impossible to get
anyone to talk to us at first.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.223
So, I wanted to see inside of
the hotel, first and foremost.

08:10.257 --> 08:13.927
Asking questions was, like
I said, getting me nowhere.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.763
So--

08:15.796 --> 08:17.731
I went to the hotel

08:17.765 --> 08:19.266
and I walked around the back

08:19.299 --> 08:21.201
and found a little window

08:21.234 --> 08:22.570
and knocked out the boards

08:22.603 --> 08:23.937
and climbed inside.

08:23.971 --> 08:28.676
(soft eerie piano music)

08:30.210 --> 08:32.111
- [Diane] The
blood on the floor,

08:32.145 --> 08:33.746
what do you make of that?

08:33.780 --> 08:34.982
- Well, it certainly
debunks the theory

08:35.015 --> 08:36.316
that there was some
sort of a gas leak,

08:36.349 --> 08:40.554
which we all knew was
bullshit in the first place.

08:40.587 --> 08:45.258
(eerie music)

08:53.901 --> 08:56.637
(screaming)

08:56.670 --> 08:59.272
(eerie music)

08:59.306 --> 09:03.310
So, I eventually found my
way to the basement door.

09:03.343 --> 09:05.879
It was blown off it's hinges,

09:05.913 --> 09:09.182
like someone had forced
their way through it

09:09.216 --> 09:12.152
and, I'm not gonna lie,

09:12.185 --> 09:14.955
I stood to the side of the door,

09:14.988 --> 09:16.657
and pointed the camera
down the stairs,

09:16.690 --> 09:19.192
and just snapped a few pictures.

09:19.226 --> 09:22.896
(soft violin music)

09:22.930 --> 09:24.765
I've seen a lot.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.700
I've been to a lot of
scary places in my carrer,

09:26.734 --> 09:31.739
and there was no way I was
going down those stairs.

09:32.372 --> 09:33.674
No way.

09:33.707 --> 09:37.978
(soft violin music)

09:38.011 --> 09:42.950
(eerie soft music)

10:06.740 --> 10:07.941
- [Diane] Would you please

10:07.975 --> 10:10.978
state your name and
age for the camera?

10:11.011 --> 10:14.147
- [Sara] I'm Sara
Havel, I'm 30 years old.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.716
- [Diane] And you were a member

10:15.749 --> 10:18.852
of Hell House since it's
beginning in 2002, correct?

10:18.886 --> 10:20.220
- Yeah.

10:20.253 --> 10:24.291
- [Diane] And, since the
night of the tragedy,

10:24.324 --> 10:27.294
where have you been, Sara?

10:27.327 --> 10:29.697
- I've been staying
with family, mostly.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.332
- [Diane] Have you
been coping okay?

10:32.365 --> 10:35.068
- I'm in a better place now.

10:35.102 --> 10:37.337
- [Diane] I'm
happy to hear that.

10:37.370 --> 10:40.373
If you don't mind, I just
want to jump right into it

10:40.407 --> 10:45.278
because obviously the
town's decision to conceal

10:45.312 --> 10:47.881
all aspects of this
tragedy from the public

10:47.915 --> 10:51.785
have caused conspiracy theorists
and normal people alike

10:51.819 --> 10:54.221
to speculate on their own.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.289
- It was the smart thing to do.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.524
- [Diane] Why?

10:57.557 --> 11:02.062
- If people knew what really
went on inside of that house,

11:02.095 --> 11:05.833
it would've been hard
for them to deal with.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.706
- [Diane] Well, I guess--

11:12.740 --> 11:14.908
I guess that's what
we're all wondering,

11:14.942 --> 11:17.044
what really happened--

11:17.077 --> 11:19.146
Can you help?

11:19.179 --> 11:21.114
- What do you want to know?

11:21.148 --> 11:22.482
- [Diane] Well, can you take us

11:22.515 --> 11:26.419
back to the beginning
and go from there?

11:31.792 --> 11:33.426
What is that?

11:33.460 --> 11:35.796
- It's everything.

11:35.829 --> 11:38.331
Everything that went on
in the house was taped.

11:38.365 --> 11:43.270
Mostly by Paul and
Tony, some tour-goers.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.939
- [Diane] How did you get
these and not the police?

11:45.973 --> 11:47.440
- I got to them first.

11:47.474 --> 11:50.043
- [Diane] Why didn't you
give them to the police?

11:50.077 --> 11:51.812
- You'll see.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.080
- [Diane] Mitchell?

11:53.113 --> 11:55.148
Mitchell's gonna
go 'head and just

11:55.182 --> 11:57.918
start looking through
those, if that's alright?

11:57.951 --> 12:02.089
(footsteps and door closing)

12:05.826 --> 12:07.761
Sara, have you watched those?

12:07.795 --> 12:09.329
- No.

12:09.362 --> 12:12.265
- [Diane] So you have
no idea what's on them?

12:14.467 --> 12:16.870
- Hell House.

12:27.848 --> 12:28.982
- [Paul] C'mon,

12:29.016 --> 12:30.884
it's a recent film,
you can get this.

12:30.918 --> 12:34.087
- Post apocalyptic,
set in New York.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.756
- [Paul] You can get this.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.092
- That's good.

12:39.126 --> 12:41.361
- [Paul] C'mon, it came
out literally a year ago.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.130
- I can't--

12:43.163 --> 12:44.064
I'm drawing a blank.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.532
Last clue.

12:45.565 --> 12:48.568
- [Paul] (sign)
Alright, Will Smith.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.204
No, Hitch was not--

12:51.238 --> 12:52.305
- I love Hitch.

12:52.339 --> 12:53.240
- [Paul] Shocker.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.407
- It's funny.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.376
- It is and I stand behind it.

12:56.409 --> 12:57.144
Paul.

12:57.177 --> 12:58.045
Don't knock it.

12:58.078 --> 12:58.812
It's a good movie.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.447
(laughing)

13:00.480 --> 13:01.915
- Is it--

13:01.949 --> 13:04.117
Okay, is it--

13:04.151 --> 13:07.187
Escape From New York.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.890
- For those watching,

13:09.923 --> 13:13.927
Sara's asking if it's a
1981 Kurt Russel joint.

13:15.062 --> 13:16.897
- So then, it's not.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.398
- [Paul] No, not
even close, c'mon.

13:18.431 --> 13:19.366
- So, have we all
just sort of given up

13:19.399 --> 13:21.534
on navigating guys,
am I doing all of it?

13:21.568 --> 13:23.103
- [Paul] Jesus Christ.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.905
I think that Alex has it
under control, right buddy?

13:24.938 --> 13:26.573
- I do have it under control.

13:26.606 --> 13:28.341
Thank you, Paul.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.977
Yes, it's straight up ahead.

13:30.010 --> 13:30.978
I recognize the road.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.279
You're not lost.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.982
We're almost there, alright?

13:35.015 --> 13:37.284
- And in today's edition of

13:37.317 --> 13:40.453
Why Are Mac and
Alex Sill Fighting,

13:40.487 --> 13:44.091
Mac and Alex are still fighting.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.861
- [Paul] They're really mad.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.331
- It gets so passionate.

13:51.364 --> 13:54.834
- [Paul] Is that what
he's like in the sack.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.639
- Guys, I'm really hungry.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.141
I'm starving.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.976
- Do you want to
pee or anything.

14:03.010 --> 14:05.645
- Yeah, can we pee out
there in the grass, please?

14:05.678 --> 14:06.613
- I mean do you--

14:06.646 --> 14:07.847
Tell me, tell me this,

14:07.881 --> 14:09.616
alright, if you're going to
a haunted house for Halloween

14:09.649 --> 14:11.618
and this is the drive over,

14:11.651 --> 14:13.486
tell me this isn't creepier
than New York City.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.055
Look, look, look,
look, look, look,

14:15.088 --> 14:16.323
there it is, there
it is, there it is.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.158
- [Paul] Is that really it?

14:18.191 --> 14:19.459
- [Alex] This is it.

14:19.492 --> 14:20.627
- [Paul] What a shit hole.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.229
I love it.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.164
- Are you kidding me.

14:24.197 --> 14:24.998
I got it.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.241
This is good.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.143
Yeah, let's stop here.

14:40.113 --> 14:42.382
- Seven years of bad
luck for breaking that.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.251
- Oh this is good, Paul,
are you getting this?

14:44.284 --> 14:46.419
You can work out on that one.

14:46.453 --> 14:47.620
- [Voiceover] We'll set you up,

14:47.654 --> 14:48.388
and we'll have a tour
guide come through.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.023
(laughing)

15:02.035 --> 15:04.037
(door creaking)

15:04.071 --> 15:05.605
- Here we go.

15:09.542 --> 15:12.445
(laughing)

15:12.479 --> 15:16.049
- Hell House 2009.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.487
When you said abandoned
I thought you meant

15:20.520 --> 15:23.623
recently foreclosed,
not condemned.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.025
- [Alex] I don't even know how

15:25.058 --> 15:26.493
you'd run power to
a place like this--

15:26.526 --> 15:28.095
- [Mac] So, if we're
gonna get power,

15:28.128 --> 15:29.662
it's gonna be because of you.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.664
(Alex and Mac fighting
in background)

15:31.698 --> 15:33.466
- And that's a sign.

15:33.500 --> 15:37.037
- [Paul] Look at
this old ass book.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.606
Oh, did you hear the pages?

15:42.609 --> 15:44.277
- You know, I need electricity

15:44.311 --> 15:46.379
to do everything
that I do here, bud.

15:46.413 --> 15:47.514
- Well, part of what you do is

15:47.547 --> 15:49.682
get the electricity
running, so--

15:49.716 --> 15:51.351
That's all you, Tony.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.320
- Stop giving me that look.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.188
- [Paul] This is
pretty creepy, man.

15:55.222 --> 15:57.290
- It smells like a sweater.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.126
- [Paul] A sweater?

15:59.159 --> 16:01.361
- An old sweater.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.464
(laughing)

16:04.497 --> 16:06.733
- Oh, the foyer.

16:06.766 --> 16:09.469
- [Paul] Dude, what is
the deal with this place.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.771
- [Sara] When did Fletcher
say the guy closes?

16:11.804 --> 16:12.605
- I don't know.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.374
It has history, alright?

16:14.407 --> 16:15.342
It's not that important.

16:15.375 --> 16:16.176
- Maybe this is a bad idea.

16:16.209 --> 16:17.544
- It's not a bad idea.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.212
Okay, look at all this
free production, alright?

16:19.246 --> 16:20.213
And, you smell that?

16:20.247 --> 16:21.448
- Yeah.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.050
- Hun, what did it
smell like to you?

16:23.083 --> 16:23.783
- I think it's probably dead
rodents in the baseboards.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.185
- [Sara] It smells like--

16:25.218 --> 16:26.019
- [Paul] It smells
like money, bro.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.187
- Thank you, Paul.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.355
Why is it that it's
Paul always on my side.

16:28.388 --> 16:29.389
- [Mac] We're not
gonna have time.

16:29.422 --> 16:32.392
- [Alex] I have no doubt we can

16:32.425 --> 16:34.527
get this up and
running by Halloween.

16:34.561 --> 16:36.463
- Alright, well,
let's get to it.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.231
- Can we see some happy faces?

16:38.265 --> 16:41.134
Paul, you ever see
a smile on my face?

16:41.168 --> 16:44.171
Now, show Mac and see the
complete utter difference.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.638
We're gonna do a time lapse.

16:45.672 --> 16:46.773
- [Paul] Wah-wah.

16:46.806 --> 16:49.676
Dude, dibs on manning
the haunted bar.

16:49.709 --> 16:50.643
- [Alex] Yeah?

16:50.677 --> 16:52.645
I'm sure house would love that.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.147
- [Paul] What do we got in here?

16:54.181 --> 16:55.648
Anything good?

16:55.682 --> 16:58.585
Nothing that matters.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.387
(coughing)

17:00.420 --> 17:01.388
- Yeah, not good.

17:01.421 --> 17:02.355
- [Paul] A little ripe, huh?

17:02.389 --> 17:06.193
I fuckin' love this place.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.527
- Yeah?

17:07.560 --> 17:10.463
What's your wine of
choice, hot shot.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.432
- [Paul] I'm kind of a
pinot grig man myself.

17:12.464 --> 17:13.733
- A pinot grig man?

17:13.766 --> 17:15.435
I'm sure they taste
like ass after

17:15.468 --> 17:18.538
however many summers
they've spent cooking.

17:18.570 --> 17:23.076
- [Paul] Dude, wine tastes
better with age, you know that.

17:23.109 --> 17:25.512
- Yeah, not with heat, though.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.548
- [Paul] You're so smart, Tony.

17:28.581 --> 17:31.151
- [Tony] God damn,

17:31.184 --> 17:33.520
this must be where the
last supper took place.

17:33.553 --> 17:34.621
(laughing)

17:34.654 --> 17:35.822
- [Alex] What's up guys.

17:35.855 --> 17:38.225
Welcome to the dining
room, I'm guessing.

17:38.258 --> 17:41.361
- [Tony] If that's what
you want to call it, sure.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.163
What do you got there?

17:43.196 --> 17:46.233
- Oh, it kinda looks
like Sara, huh?

17:46.266 --> 17:48.101
- [Paul] No, the plate's cuter.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.169
- No.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.303
What do you think, babe.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.605
Look at that.

17:53.506 --> 17:56.143
Might be her grandmother.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.812
- Well, it's a fixer
upper for sure,

17:59.846 --> 18:02.782
but it's what we do best, right?

18:02.815 --> 18:04.517
- I say we stay here the night.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.353
That's just me, but--

18:06.386 --> 18:07.754
- Uh, I don't know.

18:07.787 --> 18:11.291
- There's no fucking way we
are staying here tonight.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.328
- [Tony] I wonder if they
used this place for anything.

18:15.362 --> 18:17.697
- [Paul] I don't know, bro.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.502
- Look at this.

18:22.535 --> 18:23.503
Weird.

18:23.536 --> 18:24.737
- [Paul] Creepy.

18:24.771 --> 18:28.641
(radio static)

18:36.216 --> 18:38.218
What the fuck was that?

18:38.251 --> 18:40.453
- I don't know.

18:45.425 --> 18:46.693
- [Voiceover] Tony, Paul,

18:46.726 --> 18:48.261
get your asses down
to the basement.

18:48.295 --> 18:49.562
(laughing)

18:49.596 --> 18:53.266
- On our way.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.434
Just, turn the camera off.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.369
You're gonna break your
neck on the stairs.

18:56.403 --> 19:01.408
(creaking and footsteps)

19:14.987 --> 19:17.357
Check it out.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.559
More numbers.

19:19.592 --> 19:20.393
It's weird.

19:20.427 --> 19:21.394
(footsteps on stairs)

19:21.428 --> 19:23.730
Watch your step there, Fellini.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.898
Oh, shit!

19:25.932 --> 19:28.301
This place is amazing.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.470
- [Paul] What the
fuck happened here?

19:30.503 --> 19:33.540
- Paul, I want you to
get this on camera.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.408
So, the tour guides
are gonna come in

19:35.442 --> 19:36.609
right there down these stairs,

19:36.643 --> 19:37.444
right where you two
just came out of.

19:37.477 --> 19:38.411
- [Paul] Alright.

19:38.445 --> 19:39.379
- Then they come through,

19:39.412 --> 19:40.680
our girl's gonna be
chained up right here,

19:40.713 --> 19:42.449
she's gonna be
screaming like crazy.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.284
Alright, she might actually

19:44.317 --> 19:45.518
even be topless
for you, brother.

19:45.552 --> 19:46.686
No, I'm kidding, that's
not gonna happen.

19:46.719 --> 19:47.620
- [Paul] No, you promise.

19:47.654 --> 19:48.455
- Then we're gonna have clowns

19:48.488 --> 19:49.289
right behind this wall,

19:49.322 --> 19:50.957
one, two, three, four--

19:50.990 --> 19:52.659
however many clowns we can fit.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.693
Hopefully they'll be moving,

19:53.726 --> 19:54.927
we'll see what happens.

19:54.961 --> 19:56.729
There's a storm door
right at the end

19:56.763 --> 19:58.698
of this creepy hallway,

19:58.731 --> 19:59.932
and that's where they exit.

19:59.966 --> 20:00.867
In and out.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.236
We've handled much much worse.

20:03.270 --> 20:03.970
Remember Queens?

20:04.003 --> 20:04.704
- Yeah.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.306
- Hey, hey, hey,

20:06.339 --> 20:07.840
I thought we were never
to speak of Queens again.

20:07.874 --> 20:08.575
- [Alex] Tony--

20:08.608 --> 20:09.742
- Your words.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.344
- I need you to
worry about these.

20:11.378 --> 20:12.745
Okay?

20:12.779 --> 20:13.580
These walkie-talkies are
getting this funky noise.

20:13.613 --> 20:14.447
I don't know what it is.

20:14.481 --> 20:15.382
- [Tony] I know, I know.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.583
We were getting it upstairs too.

20:16.616 --> 20:20.387
- [Paul] Dudes, what
are all these books?

20:20.420 --> 20:22.722
- [Sara] This one's a bible.

20:22.755 --> 20:23.990
- [Paul] That's a nice touch.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.558
- [Alex] That's
definitely a bible.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.430
- That's so fucked up.

20:30.463 --> 20:33.400
- Guys, this is kind
of unsettling, right?

20:33.433 --> 20:33.966
- [Alex] C'mon, c'mon.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.302
It's a hotel.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.803
Okay, there's bibles
in every room.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.638
- Yeah, but who
put them down here.

20:38.671 --> 20:39.806
I mean, look at that wall.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.475
It's fucking creepy.

20:42.509 --> 20:43.743
- [Paul] Didn't Fletcher say

20:43.776 --> 20:44.911
this place has been
closed for 30 years?

20:44.944 --> 20:46.313
- [Sara] Okay,
why was it closed?

20:46.346 --> 20:47.013
- [Alex] Guys,
their pipes burst.

20:47.046 --> 20:48.014
There was a lawsuit.

20:48.047 --> 20:49.482
We're building a haunted house.

20:49.516 --> 20:52.285
This is half the work
already done for us.

20:52.319 --> 20:52.952
I don't know what you guys are

20:52.985 --> 20:53.953
freaking out about.

20:53.986 --> 20:56.289
That wall is perfect.

20:56.323 --> 20:58.358
- [Paul] Well, we could
look on the bright side.

20:58.391 --> 21:01.594
We get free props out of it.

21:03.963 --> 21:06.633
What size are you?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.035
- [Diane] Tell me
what it was like

21:09.068 --> 21:12.071
to live in an abandoned hotel.

21:12.104 --> 21:15.408
- It took Tony and
Paul about a week

21:15.442 --> 21:17.544
to get the electricity going and

21:17.577 --> 21:19.912
that's when we started
staying over night.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.915
It was when we
started sleeping there

21:22.949 --> 21:26.553
that things started to change.

21:26.586 --> 21:28.588
- [Diane] Change how?

21:32.592 --> 21:34.827
(laughing and talking)

21:34.861 --> 21:38.030
- [Paul] Let's see what the
rest of our crew is up to.

21:38.064 --> 21:39.632
- It was so hot.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.601
They were all dressed like
Disney princesses, okay.

21:41.634 --> 21:42.969
- Oh, look who's here!

21:43.002 --> 21:43.936
- Do you remember when all those

21:43.970 --> 21:45.438
Disney princesses came through?

21:45.472 --> 21:46.673
- [Paul] Oh, yeah, there we go.

21:46.706 --> 21:49.342
- And you were like, a
werewolf or something.

21:49.376 --> 21:51.944
- [Paul] Oh, the Disney
princesses, yeah.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.112
- Shh, shh!

21:53.145 --> 21:55.448
Jasmine was so hot.

21:55.482 --> 21:56.849
So, they all come through and

21:56.883 --> 21:58.451
me and Mac were back there and

21:58.485 --> 21:59.686
we're like, "Oh, this is it."

21:59.719 --> 22:01.020
- Dude, me and Tony
were in another room

22:01.053 --> 22:02.389
doing other things.

22:02.422 --> 22:03.956
- He was a werewolf,
what were you that year?

22:03.990 --> 22:04.857
(howling)

22:04.891 --> 22:06.459
Someone was--

22:06.493 --> 22:07.427
- I think I was like the
puss slayer, or somethin'.

22:07.460 --> 22:08.928
- They passed Tony.

22:08.961 --> 22:10.096
- [Paul] Dude what?

22:10.129 --> 22:10.963
That's the last thing
you've ever been.

22:10.997 --> 22:11.698
(laughing)

22:11.731 --> 22:12.665
C'mon man.

22:12.699 --> 22:13.966
- That's usually what I am,

22:14.000 --> 22:15.101
most days out of the week.

22:16.669 --> 22:17.970
- The moral of the story is,

22:18.004 --> 22:20.106
we tried too hard to
scare these girls,

22:20.139 --> 22:21.908
because we thought
they'd be an easy scare,

22:21.941 --> 22:23.109
and what did they do?

22:23.142 --> 22:24.544
They laughed their
fucking asses off.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.513
- [Paul] Princesses, man.

22:26.546 --> 22:27.747
- The fucking princesses.

22:27.780 --> 22:28.715
- [Paul] Yeah.

22:28.748 --> 22:29.649
- Is that the whole story?

22:29.682 --> 22:33.386
- Well, that's the
whole story on my end.

22:33.420 --> 22:34.587
- [Paul] Yeah.

22:34.621 --> 22:36.122
- Queens was actually
pretty fuckin' sick,

22:36.155 --> 22:37.323
if you think about it.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.492
We actually had some good
motherfuckin' times at Queens.

22:39.526 --> 22:42.762
- That guy who played
Lucifer was that guy

22:42.795 --> 22:44.731
from like Queens he had
a really thick New York--

22:44.764 --> 22:47.066
He'd be like, "Yeah,
welcome to Lucifer's cabin."

22:47.099 --> 22:52.071
(laughing)

22:57.143 --> 23:01.047
- [Paul] We got so many
bad reviews on that guy.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.214
- Dude, I had to fire that guy.

23:02.248 --> 23:04.484
He almost kicked my fucking ass.
- [Paul] He was terrible.

23:04.517 --> 23:05.752
- We keep in touch.

23:05.785 --> 23:06.686
- Fuck you!

23:06.719 --> 23:08.788
- I keep in touch with that guy.

23:08.821 --> 23:09.822
- That guy was an asshole.

23:09.856 --> 23:10.990
- He's decent.

23:11.023 --> 23:11.991
- You buy drugs
from him, don't you.

23:12.024 --> 23:14.627
Keep the camera running,
I want to say something.

23:14.661 --> 23:16.796
- Oh my god.

23:19.198 --> 23:20.500
- [Paul] Speech time.

23:20.533 --> 23:22.001
- I know it was hasty,

23:22.034 --> 23:23.636
moving up out of the city,

23:23.670 --> 23:25.938
coming up to this po'dunk town.

23:25.972 --> 23:26.806
You're all creeped out.

23:26.839 --> 23:27.974
You're all nervous.

23:28.007 --> 23:30.643
But we gotta keep Hell
House fresh, okay.

23:30.677 --> 23:32.745
That's why we're here.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.080
- [Paul] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:34.113 --> 23:35.047
- It's gonna work out.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.182
I know it's gonna work out.

23:36.215 --> 23:37.584
- Well, do you think we'll still

23:37.617 --> 23:38.918
get the numbers we
did in New York.

23:38.951 --> 23:40.553
- Easily.

23:40.587 --> 23:42.655
I mean, c'mon, word of
mouth after opening night.

23:42.689 --> 23:43.590
Plus, what are we?

23:43.623 --> 23:44.824
Like 40 minutes from the city.

23:44.857 --> 23:46.493
And you've seen Abaddon.

23:46.526 --> 23:48.661
This town really
appreciates Halloween.

23:48.695 --> 23:50.530
We're gonna get that
beautiful Fall feeling.

23:50.563 --> 23:51.798
You just can't get
that in a city.

23:51.831 --> 23:52.732
- Yeah, well, in
the city at least

23:52.765 --> 23:54.467
when you're creeped out
you can walk outside

23:54.501 --> 23:57.470
and fuckin' get
a slice of pizza.

23:57.504 --> 23:59.205
Here it's like,
you're creeped out

23:59.238 --> 24:00.607
you walk outside - [Paul] You
can't beat New York pizza.

24:00.640 --> 24:01.974
- and you're in
a fucking forest.

24:02.008 --> 24:03.576
- Man, say whatever
the fuck you want

24:03.610 --> 24:05.945
about Queens haunts, we
never had to sleep there.

24:05.978 --> 24:07.814
- [Sara] That is a good point.

24:07.847 --> 24:08.781
- Alright.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.850
I'm trying to get you
motivated, alright.

24:10.883 --> 24:13.219
Thank you, honey.

24:13.252 --> 24:14.987
- [Paul] I appreciate it, buddy.

24:15.021 --> 24:17.590
- You can turn the
camera off now.

24:17.624 --> 24:20.493
(static)

24:20.527 --> 24:23.563
- [Paul] Where is it?

24:23.596 --> 24:26.599
Shebang, baby!

24:26.633 --> 24:27.534
Good job, Tony!

24:27.567 --> 24:28.234
Up and running.

24:28.267 --> 24:29.836
- Thank you, sir.

24:29.869 --> 24:30.837
- Tony, I thought I said I
didn't want any blind spots.

24:30.870 --> 24:31.838
What's going on here?

24:31.871 --> 24:32.939
What room is this?

24:32.972 --> 24:34.674
- Uh, yeah, that's the basement.

24:34.707 --> 24:36.108
It's got some thick stone walls,

24:36.142 --> 24:39.746
but, we should be able to
get camera through there,

24:39.779 --> 24:40.647
or at least walkies,

24:40.680 --> 24:41.581
but we're not.

24:41.614 --> 24:42.549
We're not getting anything.

24:42.582 --> 24:43.683
So.

24:43.716 --> 24:44.684
- It's a liability.

24:44.717 --> 24:45.985
We've gotta have
eyes down there.

24:46.018 --> 24:47.086
- Yes, thank you, Mac.

24:47.119 --> 24:48.588
You have a half naked girl

24:48.621 --> 24:49.789
in a room full of assholes.

24:49.822 --> 24:50.890
Of course we need
eyes down there.

24:50.923 --> 24:52.258
- How 'bout we, you know,

24:52.291 --> 24:53.526
get some big guy,

24:53.560 --> 24:54.861
muscles, totally ripped,

24:54.894 --> 24:56.863
put him in the clown costume.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.264
- [Paul] Undercover clown, sick.

24:58.297 --> 24:59.766
- Yeah, I mean.

24:59.799 --> 25:02.068
We're gonna need an
actor down there anyway.

25:02.101 --> 25:03.736
So, why not someone
that can toss out

25:03.770 --> 25:05.171
people like Paul who wanna get

25:05.204 --> 25:08.240
a little rapey with our actor.

25:08.274 --> 25:09.275
- [Paul] He's got a point.

25:09.308 --> 25:10.843
- Sure, sure.

25:10.877 --> 25:11.911
Alright, Tony.

25:11.944 --> 25:12.912
- [Paul] Good idea, dude.

25:12.945 --> 25:13.913
- Way to go.

25:13.946 --> 25:15.782
- All that work, done.

25:15.815 --> 25:17.584
- [Paul] What's
going on here, man?

25:17.617 --> 25:19.218
It looks like shit.

25:19.251 --> 25:20.987
- Yeah, well, Alex
didn't want to

25:21.020 --> 25:22.922
spend any money on
moving props here,

25:22.955 --> 25:26.025
so we're stuck with
this one right here.

25:26.058 --> 25:27.326
Good thing that we're geniuses,

25:27.359 --> 25:28.728
so, when we're done with her,

25:28.761 --> 25:30.663
she'll be creepy as shit.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.665
(drilling)

25:32.699 --> 25:34.233
- [Paul] How's it
hangin', sweetheart?

25:34.266 --> 25:36.769
- Just, put the
camera down for a sec

25:36.803 --> 25:37.804
and help me out.

25:37.837 --> 25:39.739
- [Paul] No can do, hombre.

25:39.772 --> 25:42.842
Boy genius wants all
this shit documented.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.844
- That's a pretty
lame excuse for you

25:44.877 --> 25:47.046
to be a lazy piece of
shit like you always are.

25:47.079 --> 25:49.949
(laughing)

25:51.150 --> 25:53.285
Ladies and gentlemen,

25:53.319 --> 25:55.321
this is my buddy, Hector.

25:55.354 --> 25:58.891
Me and Hector are gonna
play a little song for you.

25:58.925 --> 26:01.293
Are you ready, Hector?

26:01.327 --> 26:06.298
(eerie piano music)

26:15.842 --> 26:18.044
Hector, it's okay.

26:18.077 --> 26:20.012
Two, three, four.

26:20.046 --> 26:22.314
(coughing)

26:23.716 --> 26:26.085
- Hello everybody.

26:26.118 --> 26:30.189
It's September 5th, 2009.

26:32.258 --> 26:34.794
We're tres weeks
into the creation

26:34.827 --> 26:37.930
of this year's Hell House.

26:37.964 --> 26:40.132
It's lonely.

26:40.166 --> 26:42.902
Sara's the only
chick in the house,

26:42.935 --> 26:45.171
and Alex don't like sharing,

26:45.204 --> 26:47.874
if you know what I mean.

26:49.041 --> 26:53.179
I had really high hopes
for this trip, you know.

26:53.212 --> 26:54.947
Really high.

26:54.981 --> 26:56.082
I thought that it was gonna be

26:56.115 --> 26:59.218
more like Grand Sexual Station.

26:59.251 --> 27:01.120
It's cool though.

27:01.153 --> 27:04.123
We got the new actors
coming tomorrow.

27:04.156 --> 27:07.026
So, hopefully one
of them's boneable.

27:08.360 --> 27:11.163
I will be documenting the
whole thing, as always.

27:11.197 --> 27:13.733
The whole shebang--

27:14.433 --> 27:16.302
Sara?

27:18.404 --> 27:21.173
What's up, dude?

27:23.743 --> 27:25.745
You cool?

27:29.348 --> 27:32.318
What, are you sleepwalking?

27:36.388 --> 27:38.858
That's fucking weird.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.994
That's it for me.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.462
See you in the morning.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.064
Sleep sweet.

27:45.097 --> 27:49.936
(creaking and talking)

28:02.414 --> 28:04.316
- I'm more in line for
this joke than you are.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.485
I feel like I'm writing it
and you're responding to it.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.955
- And then she says,
"Do you have any syrup?"

28:08.988 --> 28:11.223
You say, "No."

28:11.257 --> 28:13.192
- Oh my god!

28:13.225 --> 28:14.794
Get the fuck out of here, dude.

28:14.827 --> 28:15.795
- Get the fuck outta here.

28:15.828 --> 28:16.829
- That's not cool, man.

28:16.863 --> 28:18.030
- [Paul] C'mon, guys.

28:18.064 --> 28:19.866
You were the one with
your door cracked open.

28:19.899 --> 28:20.867
You wanted me to see.

28:20.900 --> 28:22.034
- You're not supposed to
even be here right now.

28:22.068 --> 28:22.869
Get the fuck out of here.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.270
Can you stop, seriously?

28:24.303 --> 28:25.471
- [Paul] Hey, motherfucker,

28:25.504 --> 28:28.707
I came up here to help you out.

28:29.776 --> 28:30.943
Not that!

28:30.977 --> 28:33.112
I had to tell you that
the actors are here.

28:33.145 --> 28:35.314
- The actors are here?

28:35.347 --> 28:36.282
Whose here?

28:36.315 --> 28:37.984
- [Paul] Joey, Melissa, Sam.

28:38.017 --> 28:40.219
- Joey, Melissa, Sam.

28:40.252 --> 28:41.988
Joey's clown, Melissa's--

28:42.021 --> 28:43.422
Okay, Joey, Melissa, Sam.

28:43.455 --> 28:44.156
Get that--

28:44.190 --> 28:48.260
(raining)

28:53.265 --> 28:54.100
- That's Paul.

28:54.133 --> 28:55.234
Paul's gonna be filming.

28:55.267 --> 28:56.135
Say hello to Paul,
everybody wave to Paul.

28:56.168 --> 28:57.303
Hi, Paul.

28:57.336 --> 29:02.274
(raining)

29:12.051 --> 29:13.552
- I actually found
one police officer

29:13.585 --> 29:15.855
who was willing to speak to me,

29:15.888 --> 29:20.159
under the condition of
complete anonymity, of course.

29:20.192 --> 29:23.295
He was one of the
first responders

29:23.329 --> 29:27.266
to the hotel the night of
the Hell House incident.

29:27.299 --> 29:31.170
And was one of the
first people inside.

29:31.203 --> 29:33.372
So, he said the first
body they came across

29:33.405 --> 29:35.574
was one of the
Hell House members.

29:35.607 --> 29:38.310
He couldn't say which one.

29:38.344 --> 29:41.948
But he said their
throat had been cut

29:41.981 --> 29:45.784
and that he was pretty sure

29:46.919 --> 29:50.189
that the wound was
self inflicted.

29:50.222 --> 29:55.194
(soft instrumental music)

29:57.129 --> 29:59.465
What the hell happened in there?

29:59.498 --> 30:02.034
And your guess is
as good as mine.

30:02.068 --> 30:05.037
And I honestly don't
think we'll ever know.

30:06.072 --> 30:07.239
And then, of course,

30:07.273 --> 30:11.443
there's the very strange, very
sad case of Joey Sheifler,

30:12.644 --> 30:14.981
who was in the basement
at the time of the chaos

30:15.014 --> 30:16.983
and actually made it out alive.

30:18.117 --> 30:21.287
Of course, we all
know how that ended.

30:21.320 --> 30:26.325
(eerie music)

30:44.376 --> 30:49.281
(raining)

30:58.925 --> 31:02.361
(talking)

31:02.394 --> 31:03.529
- Hey Paul!

31:03.562 --> 31:04.496
- [Paul] Hey baby,
how you doin' girl?

31:04.530 --> 31:05.998
- Getting a little nervous,

31:06.032 --> 31:07.233
so if you wouldn't mind.

31:07.266 --> 31:08.067
- [Paul] What are
you nervous about?

31:08.100 --> 31:08.935
Taking your top off?

31:08.968 --> 31:10.136
- Oh my god, no.

31:10.169 --> 31:12.071
Thanks for a lot of help, Paul.
- [Paul] Oh, you're so cute.

31:12.104 --> 31:14.373
- No, you are not taking
your top off, my god!

31:14.406 --> 31:16.542
You are however very important.

31:16.575 --> 31:18.210
Okay, you're our
main attraction.

31:18.244 --> 31:19.311
You're at the end of the tour,

31:19.345 --> 31:20.246
you're in the basement.

31:20.279 --> 31:21.981
You're our damsel in distress.

31:22.014 --> 31:24.350
- Right no one's gonna be
touching me or anything?

31:24.383 --> 31:25.517
- No.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.053
No one's gonna get
near you, okay?

31:27.086 --> 31:28.254
You met Joey the
other day, right?

31:28.287 --> 31:29.488
Joey's gonna be in one
of the clown suits,

31:29.521 --> 31:31.157
and he'll be down their
with you all night.

31:31.190 --> 31:34.393
- Can I ask why you're
filming everything?

31:34.426 --> 31:36.328
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

31:36.362 --> 31:37.529
A lot of this is just for us.

31:37.563 --> 31:40.332
It helps us next year
with our next haunt.

31:40.366 --> 31:42.001
But, you know,
it's good for fans.

31:42.034 --> 31:43.402
Maybe something for the website.

31:43.435 --> 31:45.004
- [Paul] Plus I'm
trying to catch a ghost.

31:45.037 --> 31:47.373
- So you have heard the
rumors about this place.

31:47.406 --> 31:48.607
- There are no rumors about this
place. - [Paul] What rumors?

31:48.640 --> 31:50.676
- No, rumors, we
talked about this.

31:50.709 --> 31:51.543
Just, shut down.

31:51.577 --> 31:52.411
That's all Mary says.

31:52.444 --> 31:53.412
It's just shut down.

31:53.445 --> 31:54.680
- [Paul] What do you know?

31:54.713 --> 31:55.481
- [Alex] She doesn't
know anything.

31:55.514 --> 31:56.348
Tell him that

31:56.382 --> 31:57.283
- I don't know anything.

31:58.450 --> 31:59.585
The owner was supposed to have

31:59.618 --> 32:00.619
hung himself in here.

32:00.652 --> 32:01.687
- [Alex] Ohh!
- [Paul] What?

32:01.720 --> 32:03.956
Oh, when did that shit happen?

32:03.990 --> 32:04.991
You did not mention that,
Alex - [Alex] Do not take
your own way with this.

32:05.024 --> 32:05.524
Cause it didn't happen.

32:05.557 --> 32:06.692
It's a rumor.

32:06.725 --> 32:07.593
That's why they
call them rumors.

32:07.626 --> 32:08.560
- I don't know.

32:08.594 --> 32:09.395
- [Paul] Is this something?

32:09.428 --> 32:10.229
Is this local knowledge?

32:10.262 --> 32:11.297
- It's the story.

32:11.330 --> 32:12.264
I guess yeah.

32:12.298 --> 32:13.432
- It's just a story, Paul.

32:13.465 --> 32:15.301
- [Paul] Was he into
Satanic rituals?

32:15.334 --> 32:16.268
- Satanic rituals?

32:16.302 --> 32:17.203
I wouldn't know, why?

32:17.236 --> 32:18.570
- [Paul] Dude, Alex, c'mon,

32:18.604 --> 32:21.440
all the fuckin' wall art
downstairs in the basement.

32:21.473 --> 32:22.508
- What about it?

32:22.541 --> 32:23.475
- That wasn't you guys?

32:23.509 --> 32:24.443
I thought you did that.

32:24.476 --> 32:25.978
- [Paul] No, that shit's OG.

32:26.012 --> 32:28.480
- I guess what the story is is,

32:28.514 --> 32:31.350
things kept happening
to the guests here

32:31.383 --> 32:32.751
that forced them to
shut the place down.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.186
- [Paul] Whoa, what, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:34.220 --> 32:35.154
Hold up, hold up.

32:35.187 --> 32:36.555
What happened to the guests?

32:36.588 --> 32:38.057
- I'm the worst person to
ask about local history.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.225
I don't know.

32:39.258 --> 32:40.192
- They had a great
time, they left,

32:40.226 --> 32:41.127
they never heard from them again

32:41.160 --> 32:41.760
because nobody writes reviews in

32:41.793 --> 32:43.195
19- whatever the place.

32:43.229 --> 32:44.596
- Exactly, maybe.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.232
I mean, it's supposed
to be haunted,

32:46.265 --> 32:47.533
but, you would know
more than I would.

32:47.566 --> 32:49.535
Have you heard any
bumps in the night? -
[Alex] It's not haunted.

32:49.568 --> 32:52.471
Paul, don't you have some
work to do with Tony?

32:52.504 --> 32:53.539
Doesn't he need a hand?

32:53.572 --> 32:55.074
- [Paul] I'm off today.

32:55.107 --> 32:56.542
- No, there is no off day.

32:56.575 --> 32:58.444
Alright, this is every day work.

32:58.477 --> 32:59.178
What are you--

32:59.211 --> 33:00.412
C'mon.

33:00.446 --> 33:01.147
- [Paul] Alright,
alright, alright.

33:01.180 --> 33:02.081
I'm outta here.

33:02.114 --> 33:03.049
Just a little kiss real quick.

33:03.082 --> 33:04.016
- I'm not kissing the camera.

33:04.050 --> 33:05.417
Can you stop trying to
make me kiss the camera.

33:05.451 --> 33:07.186
- [Paul] Alright,
baby, as always.

33:07.219 --> 33:08.420
- [Alex] No, this
is not happening.

33:08.454 --> 33:09.621
(kissing)

33:09.655 --> 33:11.057
- [Paul] If you need
anything, alright?

33:11.090 --> 33:12.091
You just let me know. -
[Alex] She doesn't need
anything from you, Paul.

33:12.124 --> 33:13.025
- Okay.

33:13.059 --> 33:13.659
- [Paul] Okay, a massage,

33:13.692 --> 33:14.493
I'm a master of oil.

33:14.526 --> 33:15.461
- I do appreciate it.

33:15.494 --> 33:16.595
- Okay, she was nervous before

33:16.628 --> 33:17.563
and now she's scared,
thank you, Paul.

33:17.596 --> 33:18.730
- [Paul] Okay, how old
are you, by the way?

33:18.764 --> 33:19.731
- No, this is not important.

33:19.765 --> 33:22.434
- We'll never know what
happened in that hotel.

33:25.171 --> 33:27.173
Just like we'll never know how

33:27.206 --> 33:28.507
the Hell House
crew came to put on

33:28.540 --> 33:31.410
their Halloween tour
their 20 years later.

33:33.379 --> 33:34.613
Just like we'll
never know exactly

33:34.646 --> 33:36.115
what happened to Andrew Tully.

33:36.148 --> 33:37.516
- The more you dig
into the history

33:37.549 --> 33:39.285
of the Abaddon Hotel,

33:39.318 --> 33:41.120
the more unsettling it gets.

33:41.153 --> 33:43.655
And it all begins with a
man named Andrew Tully.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.324
- I'm almost certain
that the group

33:45.357 --> 33:49.095
knew nothing about
the hotel going in.

33:49.128 --> 33:51.797
I doubt they knew
anything about Tully.

33:51.830 --> 33:54.800
I doubt they knew anything
about missing guests.

33:54.833 --> 33:58.137
Why he built the hotel in
Abaddon in the first place,

33:58.170 --> 33:59.105
any of it.

33:59.138 --> 34:00.239
- The local ghost story is that

34:00.272 --> 34:02.674
Tully built the hotel
because the name of the town.

34:02.708 --> 34:05.444
In some versions of the bible,

34:05.477 --> 34:07.146
Abaddon is the name of the demon

34:07.179 --> 34:09.547
who guards the gateway to hell.

34:09.581 --> 34:12.384
Some people say that Tully
was the head of some cult

34:12.418 --> 34:15.387
and that he considered himself a

34:15.420 --> 34:18.290
latter-day Dante.

34:18.324 --> 34:19.791
- [Diane] What
happened to the guests?

34:19.824 --> 34:21.760
- Well, there were a few.

34:21.793 --> 34:25.464
But the first one was
an 11 year old girl.

34:25.496 --> 34:27.666
I think she was 11,

34:27.699 --> 34:29.201
and her mother,

34:30.436 --> 34:32.271
both disappeared,

34:32.304 --> 34:35.174
last seen checking
into the hotel.

34:35.206 --> 34:36.408
- [Diane] Did
Tully do something?

34:36.442 --> 34:37.708
Was he questioned by the police?

34:37.743 --> 34:38.844
- Oh yeah.

34:38.877 --> 34:39.811
He was questioned by the police.

34:39.844 --> 34:41.313
Multiple times, actually.

34:41.347 --> 34:43.181
- When that woman and
her daughter disappeared

34:43.215 --> 34:46.452
and their last known location
was The Abaddon Hotel,

34:46.485 --> 34:48.687
Tully was able to
produce records

34:48.719 --> 34:51.322
that showed their departure,

34:51.357 --> 34:56.128
so he was cleared of
any wrong doing, but--

34:56.161 --> 34:58.230
It wasn't enough to
stop all the questions

34:58.264 --> 35:00.666
and basically kill business.

35:00.699 --> 35:02.268
A few months later,

35:02.301 --> 35:04.336
he hanged himself in the
dining room of the hotel.

35:04.370 --> 35:09.375
(soft eerie music)

35:16.315 --> 35:20.219
(footsteps on stairs)

35:20.252 --> 35:23.389
- [Paul] Jesus Christ
those fuckers are creepy.

35:23.422 --> 35:24.490
- [Alex] I guess I'll put Joey--

35:24.523 --> 35:26.458
I'll put Joey right here.

35:26.492 --> 35:27.693
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:27.726 --> 35:28.660
- [Alex] We'll get
this guy out of here

35:28.694 --> 35:29.528
and I'll put Joey in there,

35:29.561 --> 35:30.729
what do you think?

35:30.762 --> 35:31.863
- [Paul] Where's
Melissa gonna go?

35:31.897 --> 35:34.333
- Back there on the wall.

35:34.366 --> 35:35.634
- [Paul] Are we
absolutely certain

35:35.667 --> 35:37.369
that she can't be topless?

35:37.403 --> 35:40.672
- Paul, if you want to
see her boobies so badly

35:40.706 --> 35:42.474
why don't you just ask her?

35:42.508 --> 35:44.776
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
chicks dig that.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.445
- Yeah, especially
from you, bro.

35:46.478 --> 35:48.214
- [Paul] Baby, I love you
too much for a lawsuit.

35:48.247 --> 35:50.382
- Thank you.

35:50.416 --> 35:52.184
- I guess it's not
that big of a deal.

35:52.218 --> 35:52.818
- [Paul] What?

35:52.851 --> 35:53.552
What's the problem?

35:53.585 --> 35:54.820
- This dummy,

35:54.853 --> 35:56.388
his head doesn't move so,

35:56.422 --> 35:57.723
they'll all have to be
facing the same direction,

35:57.756 --> 35:59.925
rather than one that
way, one this way.

35:59.958 --> 36:01.260
- [Paul] Who gives a shit?

36:01.293 --> 36:02.661
They're all fucking
creepy anyways.

36:02.694 --> 36:05.264
- That's a really great
mask and I just don't think

36:05.297 --> 36:07.299
we should waste it on a
dummy that doesn't move.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.402
- Well, Paul, what do you think?

36:10.436 --> 36:12.304
Do you wanna slap on this mask,

36:12.338 --> 36:14.540
sit down here all night
and stare at Melissa?

36:16.842 --> 36:17.909
Of course he does.

36:17.943 --> 36:19.278
It was a joke, bro.

36:19.311 --> 36:21.247
It's never gonna happen.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.682
- Fuckin' light.

36:28.387 --> 36:30.856
I just heard a strange noise.

36:33.325 --> 36:35.727
I'm gonna go investigate.

36:41.567 --> 36:43.602
Yo, dude, did you hear that?

36:43.635 --> 36:46.938
- Yeah, it sounded
like a scream.

36:46.972 --> 36:47.773
- [Paul] What the fuck was that?

36:47.806 --> 36:49.275
You guys hear that?

36:49.308 --> 36:50.709
- I definitely heard something.

36:50.742 --> 36:52.344
- I didn't hear anything.

36:52.378 --> 36:55.581
- So, we just all woke
up at the same time?

36:55.614 --> 36:58.417
- No, you woke me up.

36:58.450 --> 37:00.852
- [Mac] Tony, are we
rolling video anywhere?

37:00.886 --> 37:01.887
- No.

37:01.920 --> 37:02.854
Should we?

37:02.888 --> 37:03.889
- [Alex] Yes.
- [Mac] No.

37:03.922 --> 37:04.556
- No.

37:04.590 --> 37:04.990
- Yes.

37:05.023 --> 37:05.857
- No.

37:05.891 --> 37:10.396
(creaking)

37:17.002 --> 37:20.639
- [Paul] Maybe it's
the soundboard?

37:24.843 --> 37:28.280
Some leaky roofs.

37:28.314 --> 37:29.948
Tony's gonna have to fix that.

37:29.981 --> 37:32.017
- We could have like a chef guy

37:32.050 --> 37:33.919
standing back here
like going crazy.

37:33.952 --> 37:34.886
- Remember these?

37:34.920 --> 37:36.822
Oh yeah, that's a good idea.

37:36.855 --> 37:37.623
- You know what I mean?

37:37.656 --> 37:38.757
- Chef guy.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.359
- He'll be like,
"What do you want?"

37:40.392 --> 37:41.527
(laughing)

37:41.560 --> 37:42.628
Sever people, dude.

37:42.661 --> 37:43.762
- Oh my god.

37:43.795 --> 37:44.630
- [Paul] A talented
motherfucker.

37:44.663 --> 37:46.965
- This is our clown.

37:46.998 --> 37:48.500
- Your welcome, guys.

37:48.534 --> 37:49.435
You're welcome.

37:49.468 --> 37:50.068
- [Alex] Thank you, Tony.

37:50.101 --> 37:50.802
- [Mac] Yeah, good work.

37:50.836 --> 37:52.003
Good work.

37:52.037 --> 37:53.939
- I have some stuff
I have to get you

37:53.972 --> 37:55.341
to fill out or whatever.

37:55.374 --> 37:57.609
- Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah,

37:57.643 --> 37:58.810
Mac with all his--

37:58.844 --> 38:00.546
- [Paul] Hey, whatever happened
to the handshake deal, Mac?

38:00.579 --> 38:02.781
Can I get the eye one more
time for camera, dude?

38:02.814 --> 38:04.015
- Oh yeah.

38:04.049 --> 38:07.686
(yelling)

38:07.719 --> 38:09.054
- [Alex] That's so creepy!

38:09.087 --> 38:10.088
- [Paul] That's so cool, dude.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.423
Good fucking find, dude.

38:11.457 --> 38:12.658
- Yeah, man, thanks.

38:12.691 --> 38:14.893
I just had to send him
down to the basement.

38:14.926 --> 38:17.095
- [Paul] Where'd
you find this guy?

38:17.128 --> 38:18.730
- The gas station.

38:18.764 --> 38:19.898
- [Paul] Holy shit.

38:19.931 --> 38:21.667
He was working there
or he was just hanging?

38:21.700 --> 38:23.635
- I'm not even sure.

38:23.669 --> 38:25.337
- Now, that's bothered
me with it's hair.

38:25.371 --> 38:26.538
But it's frozen, I
love the frozen--

38:26.572 --> 38:29.007
- Guys, guys, Joey
did his trick again,

38:29.040 --> 38:30.409
and his eye came out.

38:30.442 --> 38:31.777
- [All] Whoa! (screaming)

38:31.810 --> 38:35.113
* I'm writing a letter

38:35.146 --> 38:37.816
* To daddy

38:37.849 --> 38:42.421
* His mailbox is inevitable

38:43.655 --> 38:46.992
- [Paul] This room
looks sick, man.

38:47.025 --> 38:49.728
There's a bunch
of babes in here.

38:52.130 --> 38:54.833
This room looks shitty.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.668
Pretty shitty.

38:56.702 --> 38:58.937
How's it hangin', boss.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.806
(chains rattling)

39:00.839 --> 39:03.108
(chuckling)

39:03.141 --> 39:06.578
Oh, hector.

39:06.612 --> 39:07.746
Sup, dude.

39:07.779 --> 39:09.448
What's goin' on?

39:09.481 --> 39:11.717
Where's Alex and Sara?

39:11.750 --> 39:14.620
- They went into the city to
get the rest of the stuff.

39:14.653 --> 39:15.921
- [Paul] Oh, sick.

39:15.954 --> 39:17.389
Where's Tony?

39:17.423 --> 39:18.757
- I think he's around.

39:18.790 --> 39:20.626
- [Paul] Tony?

39:22.894 --> 39:24.362
T-dog

39:28.199 --> 39:30.769
Oh, dude.

39:34.540 --> 39:36.475
Oh!

39:36.508 --> 39:38.910
I think you've had
enough to drink.

39:40.679 --> 39:41.947
Tony.

39:41.980 --> 39:44.750
Whoa, shit, dude.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.452
What's up, man.

39:46.485 --> 39:49.154
What are you looking at?

39:52.791 --> 39:54.526
Holy fuck!

39:54.560 --> 39:57.162
You got me man.

39:57.195 --> 39:59.465
Alright, weirdo.

39:59.498 --> 40:02.934
Let me know when you want to
get back to work down there.

40:05.236 --> 40:09.541
(humming)

40:12.578 --> 40:13.545
What the fuck are you do--

40:13.579 --> 40:14.746
You were just right--

40:14.780 --> 40:15.914
What the fuck are
you doing here?

40:15.947 --> 40:17.516
- [Tony] I got you a little rat.

40:17.549 --> 40:19.017
- [Paul] You fuck--

40:19.050 --> 40:22.120
(running)

40:23.722 --> 40:25.657
What the fuck?

40:25.691 --> 40:28.527
What the fuck, man?

40:28.560 --> 40:31.630
You were just standing
right fucking here.

40:31.663 --> 40:32.564
Hello, Alex?

40:32.598 --> 40:33.965
Is that you, you asshole?

40:35.901 --> 40:38.003
What the fuck?

40:39.037 --> 40:41.707
Alex, don't fuck with me.

40:41.740 --> 40:42.774
Dude.

40:42.808 --> 40:43.675
Tony, what the fuck?

40:43.709 --> 40:47.946
(running)

40:49.915 --> 40:51.082
What, are you fucking with me?

40:51.116 --> 40:53.585
What the fuck was that?

40:53.619 --> 40:55.053
What the fuck was that?

40:55.086 --> 40:56.622
- Calm down.

40:58.123 --> 41:00.726
- Jesus Paul, how much
shit have you shot today.

41:00.759 --> 41:01.960
- [Paul] Just watch,
it's coming up.

41:01.993 --> 41:05.697
Oh, I think you've
had enough to drink!

41:05.731 --> 41:07.866
(chuckling)

41:07.899 --> 41:09.701
Tony!

41:09.735 --> 41:12.237
Whoa, shit, dude.

41:12.270 --> 41:14.606
What's up, man?

41:14.640 --> 41:16.608
What are you looking at?

41:19.778 --> 41:21.246
Holy fuck!

41:21.279 --> 41:24.049
- Oh my God.

41:24.082 --> 41:24.983
- Who is that?

41:25.016 --> 41:26.251
- How Paul?

41:26.284 --> 41:28.253
How'd you do it?

41:28.286 --> 41:29.621
- [Paul] Do what?

41:29.655 --> 41:31.523
- You did this.

41:31.557 --> 41:33.725
- [Paul] Why would I
do this shit, dude?

41:33.759 --> 41:35.994
- To fuck with us,
like you always do.

41:36.027 --> 41:37.963
Wait, so it's the two of you?

41:37.996 --> 41:39.297
- [Paul] No, I shot this solo.

41:39.330 --> 41:40.131
(laughing)

41:40.165 --> 41:41.733
- [Alex] Okay, Romero.

41:41.767 --> 41:43.769
I'm proud of you two.

41:43.802 --> 41:45.003
Great prank.

41:45.036 --> 41:47.539
- [Mac] Put that much
work into the haunt.

41:47.573 --> 41:52.544
(wind blowing and
birds chirping)

41:57.649 --> 41:59.184
- [Paul] We built
a haunted house,

41:59.217 --> 42:00.285
we can do a commercial.

42:00.318 --> 42:01.219
- Follow my lead.

42:01.252 --> 42:02.788
- This is ridiculous, dude.

42:02.821 --> 42:04.289
- I just don't want to show
the inside of the house,

42:04.322 --> 42:05.757
because A. We're
not done with it,

42:05.791 --> 42:08.794
and B. I don't want to
give away our scares.

42:08.827 --> 42:10.662
So, I want to do
something kind of

42:10.696 --> 42:11.863
catchy and funny.

42:11.897 --> 42:14.900
- You know, um, he
wasn't there really.

42:14.933 --> 42:15.734
You know?

42:15.767 --> 42:17.869
- Gerald, Gerald,

42:17.903 --> 42:20.038
what are you doing with her?

42:20.071 --> 42:22.140
Gerald!

42:22.173 --> 42:23.742
What is this?

42:23.775 --> 42:24.776
- Don't overt your eyes.

42:24.810 --> 42:25.777
- I thought you were at work.

42:25.811 --> 42:29.147
- [Paul] I'm not doing
too well cause they--

42:29.180 --> 42:31.149
- Check it out.

42:31.182 --> 42:32.317
- [Paul] What?

42:32.350 --> 42:33.919
- Check out Sara.

42:38.289 --> 42:41.292
- [Paul] What's she doing?

42:41.326 --> 42:43.161
- [Tony] Sara!

42:43.194 --> 42:45.831
What are you doing?

42:51.369 --> 42:53.371
- [Paul] Looks good, dude.

42:53.404 --> 42:54.840
- Yeah, it's on.

42:54.873 --> 42:56.942
- [Paul] She's pretty, man.

42:56.975 --> 42:58.076
- Sara?

42:58.109 --> 43:00.211
- Alright, so we're
gonna show you

43:00.245 --> 43:02.848
all the fine work
that Tone-Dog and I

43:02.881 --> 43:05.617
have been doing, hard work too.

43:05.651 --> 43:06.918
I'm exhausted.

43:06.952 --> 43:08.219
- [Tony] Alright, man.

43:12.824 --> 43:13.959
Locked and loaded?

43:13.992 --> 43:15.293
- [Paul] I don't
know, you tell me?

43:15.326 --> 43:17.028
- You're good.

43:17.062 --> 43:19.130
Just don't shit your
pants like last time.

43:19.164 --> 43:20.699
- [Paul] Alright, good.

43:20.732 --> 43:22.100
Check the frame in the back.

43:23.769 --> 43:24.703
Does it look right?

43:24.736 --> 43:26.104
It's not angled through that?

43:26.137 --> 43:27.038
- [Tony] No.

43:27.072 --> 43:28.206
- [Paul] Alright, cool.

43:28.239 --> 43:29.374
- [Tony] Perfect.

43:29.407 --> 43:30.408
- [Paul] Alright
dude, lock me in.

43:30.441 --> 43:31.843
- Alright.

43:31.877 --> 43:33.679
(handshake slapping)

43:33.712 --> 43:34.646
- [Paul] Cool, dude.

43:34.680 --> 43:36.682
- Godspeed.

43:47.192 --> 43:49.160
(static and voices
over walkie-talkies)

43:49.194 --> 43:52.297
- [Paul] Alright,
cue the lights.

43:53.865 --> 43:57.002
- [Tony] Lights have been cued.

43:57.035 --> 43:59.738
- [Paul] Cue the strobers.

43:59.771 --> 44:01.372
- [Tony] Strobers cued.

44:05.276 --> 44:06.411
- [Paul] It's pretty good, man.

44:06.444 --> 44:09.681
I think we're in
fucking business man.

44:09.715 --> 44:11.049
- [Tony] Kill it.

44:19.490 --> 44:23.328
- [Paul] Hey man, how
many freaks did we have?

44:24.930 --> 44:27.365
- [Tony] Three freaks.

44:27.398 --> 44:29.768
Why, what's going on?

44:29.801 --> 44:32.137
- [Paul] Are you sure?

44:32.170 --> 44:33.438
- [Tony] Positive.

44:33.471 --> 44:35.974
- [Paul] What the shit?

44:36.007 --> 44:37.909
(footsteps and pounding)

44:37.943 --> 44:39.911
Tony, let me out.

44:39.945 --> 44:41.246
(knocking)

44:41.279 --> 44:42.447
Let me the fuck out, dude.

44:42.480 --> 44:44.015
This is not fucking cool.

44:44.049 --> 44:45.316
Where the fuck are you.

44:45.350 --> 44:49.054
Tony, let me the fuck out.

44:49.087 --> 44:50.021
Tony, fuck!

44:50.055 --> 44:52.023
Let me the fuck out!

44:59.164 --> 45:00.365
(gagging and retching)

45:00.398 --> 45:01.466
- [Tony] Dude, are you alright?

45:01.499 --> 45:02.467
Jesus Christ, man.

45:02.500 --> 45:04.169
What the fuck is wrong with you?

45:04.202 --> 45:08.306
(eerie music)

45:39.504 --> 45:41.072
- Dude, I'm just
telling you what we saw.

45:41.106 --> 45:42.273
- You saw the same thing
that I saw on that screen.

45:42.307 --> 45:43.474
- No, no, no, we all went up
there. - [Paul] and so did Mac,

45:43.508 --> 45:45.176
- We didn't see anything.
- [Paul] And so did you, Sara.

45:45.210 --> 45:46.344
- First of all, keep
your voice down.

45:46.377 --> 45:48.113
I don't want any of
the actors to hear you.

45:48.146 --> 45:50.281
Two weeks to go 'til the show.

45:50.315 --> 45:51.516
- They should hear me.

45:51.549 --> 45:52.918
Okay, everybody should
know what's going on.

45:52.951 --> 45:53.919
- Two weeks to go
and all our actors

45:53.952 --> 45:55.286
are gonna get scared and
run away because of you.

45:55.320 --> 45:56.888
What are we gonna do
when we have no actors?

45:56.922 --> 45:58.256
- [Paul] You're talking
like a fucking insane man.

45:58.289 --> 45:59.324
- I'm talking like
a business man.

45:59.357 --> 46:00.158
Do you wanna be here?

46:00.191 --> 46:01.292
Do you wanna make money?

46:01.326 --> 46:02.293
Do you want Hell
House to be a success?

46:02.327 --> 46:03.995
Calm down.

46:04.029 --> 46:06.097
I'm sorry you got scared.

46:06.131 --> 46:07.833
- [Paul] This is
fuckin' ridiculous, man.

46:07.866 --> 46:08.566
- No, you're ridiculous.

46:08.599 --> 46:09.567
- [Tony] Paul, Paul, Paul.

46:09.600 --> 46:10.568
Dude, just come back.

46:10.601 --> 46:11.937
Are you gonna be okay.

46:14.205 --> 46:16.574
Jesus Christ, Alex.

46:16.607 --> 46:18.376
- Don't you start on me now.

46:18.409 --> 46:20.545
- [Tony] It's
getting worse, man.

46:20.578 --> 46:23.815
- Can you turn the camera off.

46:24.950 --> 46:27.919
- I think Alex was
his own worst enemy.

46:27.953 --> 46:30.321
For whatever reason he
had up in that hotel,

46:30.355 --> 46:31.890
I think it was--

46:31.923 --> 46:33.825
I think he believed it was

46:33.859 --> 46:35.894
in the best interest
for the company.

46:35.927 --> 46:37.462
His company.

46:37.495 --> 46:40.198
That company he created.

46:41.399 --> 46:43.935
The others were
simply loyal to him.

46:43.969 --> 46:46.304
He and Sara had been
together for years.

46:46.337 --> 46:48.539
He and McNamera
grew up together.

46:48.573 --> 46:51.509
They'd known each other
since they were boys.

46:51.542 --> 46:56.247
Tony and Paul were, I
think, his first hires.

46:56.281 --> 46:57.448
Oh yeah.

46:57.482 --> 46:59.217
Oh, there was a bond there.

47:02.087 --> 47:07.092
(creaking and heavy breathing)

47:13.098 --> 47:14.232
- [Paul] Fuck!

47:14.265 --> 47:16.201
Jesus Christ!

47:16.234 --> 47:21.072
(heavy breathing)

47:21.106 --> 47:21.907
Fuck, dude!

47:21.940 --> 47:22.908
- What are you doing?

47:22.941 --> 47:24.475
- [Paul] Look!

47:24.509 --> 47:25.210
- [Tony] Fuck!

47:25.243 --> 47:26.044
Did you move it?

47:26.077 --> 47:26.878
- [Paul] No, man!

47:26.912 --> 47:28.213
I was fucking sleeping!

47:28.246 --> 47:29.414
- [Tony] Are you trying
to fuck with me again?

47:29.447 --> 47:31.449
- [Paul] No!

47:31.482 --> 47:34.285
- [Tony] What's it doing there?

47:34.319 --> 47:35.353
- [Paul] I don't know, man.

47:35.386 --> 47:37.889
I was fucking sleeping.

47:37.923 --> 47:39.390
- [Tony] Oh, for fucks sake.

47:39.424 --> 47:40.591
Alright.

47:40.625 --> 47:42.427
- [Paul] Be careful!

47:42.460 --> 47:47.265
(creaking)

47:53.704 --> 47:55.573
Careful, man.

47:57.943 --> 47:59.010
(patting)

47:59.044 --> 47:59.978
What is it?

48:00.011 --> 48:02.080
- It's a fucking mannequin.

48:02.113 --> 48:03.982
Dipshit.

48:06.985 --> 48:10.956
Guess I'll put him in the back.

48:10.989 --> 48:15.293
(creaking)

48:26.271 --> 48:27.405
- [Paul] What the fuck?

48:27.438 --> 48:32.077
(Sara mumbling)

48:32.110 --> 48:33.278
What the shit is she doing up?

48:33.311 --> 48:35.080
- [Tony] Is that Sara?

48:35.113 --> 48:36.681
Sara?

48:36.714 --> 48:37.415
- [Paul] Sara?

48:37.448 --> 48:38.149
- [Tony] Sara?

48:38.183 --> 48:41.919
(creaking)

48:43.188 --> 48:45.023
- [Paul] Sara?

48:45.056 --> 48:47.658
- What the fuck is
she doing down here?

48:50.061 --> 48:51.396
Sara?

48:51.429 --> 48:53.531
(Sara speaking in
a foreign language)

48:53.564 --> 48:55.600
Sara, are you okay?

48:56.634 --> 48:59.304
Sara, you okay?

48:59.337 --> 49:01.339
(Sara mumbling)

49:01.372 --> 49:02.273
- [Paul] Don't, Jesus.

49:03.241 --> 49:04.375
- Sara!

49:04.409 --> 49:05.977
(screaming and whimpering)

49:06.011 --> 49:06.611
Sara, Sara.

49:06.644 --> 49:08.179
Sara, Sara, you're fine.

49:08.213 --> 49:08.713
You're fine.

49:08.746 --> 49:09.580
You're okay.

49:09.614 --> 49:10.481
Shhh.

49:10.515 --> 49:11.382
Sara, you're fine.

49:11.416 --> 49:12.683
Sara, you're downstairs.

49:12.717 --> 49:13.584
You're fine.

49:13.618 --> 49:14.319
You're fine.

49:14.352 --> 49:15.053
Hey, hey, hey.

49:15.086 --> 49:15.987
You're fine.

49:16.021 --> 49:17.588
- [Paul] Jesus fucking Christ.

49:17.622 --> 49:19.324
- It's okay.

49:19.357 --> 49:20.725
What the fuck, dude?

49:20.758 --> 49:22.727
- [Paul] Let's get
the fuck out of here.

49:22.760 --> 49:24.195
- Come here.

49:24.229 --> 49:25.596
Come here.

49:25.630 --> 49:27.365
You're alright.

49:27.398 --> 49:29.967
- [Paul] Oh fuck!

49:31.402 --> 49:32.470
- [Tony] What the fuck?

49:32.503 --> 49:34.105
- [Paul] Mac!

49:34.139 --> 49:36.174
- Where the fuck is he?

49:36.207 --> 49:38.176
He was just fucking here.

49:38.209 --> 49:39.477
- [Sara] Guys, can
we go upstairs?

49:39.510 --> 49:44.349
(heavy breathing)

49:46.584 --> 49:49.287
- [Paul] Fuck, fuck, fuck.

49:51.656 --> 49:53.624
You just fucking put it there.

49:53.658 --> 49:54.625
Careful, careful.

49:54.659 --> 49:59.097
(heavy breathing)

50:05.103 --> 50:05.803
Okay.

50:05.836 --> 50:07.172
Okay, guys.

50:07.205 --> 50:08.806
One, two, three.

50:08.839 --> 50:14.045
(creaking and heavy breathing)

50:19.250 --> 50:20.518
It's okay.

50:20.551 --> 50:22.120
There's nothing here.

50:22.153 --> 50:24.589
There's nothing fucking here.

50:24.622 --> 50:26.291
There's nothing fucking here.

50:26.324 --> 50:28.526
(heavy breathing)

50:28.559 --> 50:30.295
- I don't fucking know.

50:35.100 --> 50:36.567
- [Paul] You guys okay?

50:36.601 --> 50:37.735
You guys okay?

50:37.768 --> 50:39.270
- Yeah, I'm fine.

50:39.304 --> 50:40.105
(grandfather clock chiming)

50:40.138 --> 50:41.806
(screaming)

50:41.839 --> 50:43.641
What the fuck?

50:43.674 --> 50:44.809
(grandfather clock chiming)

50:44.842 --> 50:46.644
(screaming)

50:46.677 --> 50:48.713
- [Paul] Holy shit.
- [Tony] Oh, fuck.

50:48.746 --> 50:49.647
(screaming)

50:49.680 --> 50:50.415
No!

50:50.448 --> 50:51.816
Oh, fuck!

50:51.849 --> 50:54.185
- [Paul] Holy shit!

50:56.354 --> 50:59.424
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

50:59.457 --> 51:03.461
(running upstairs)

51:06.197 --> 51:10.501
(birds chipring)

51:32.357 --> 51:34.559
(sniffling)

51:37.228 --> 51:38.796
It's three days

51:40.798 --> 51:43.401
until the opening

51:43.434 --> 51:45.736
of Hell House.

51:46.837 --> 51:49.240
Yippee.

51:50.341 --> 51:53.244
Everyone's a little stressed.

51:55.380 --> 51:57.482
I personally think

51:57.515 --> 52:00.385
we have no business being here.

52:01.452 --> 52:04.789
Alex is more
confident than ever.

52:07.925 --> 52:09.894
Whereas Sara--

52:11.196 --> 52:14.131
She just doesn't look good.

52:16.367 --> 52:18.836
She usually does.

52:27.212 --> 52:29.914
That's all from me.

52:31.549 --> 52:33.518
Sleep sweet.

52:44.362 --> 52:47.432
(screeching)

52:51.969 --> 52:56.341
(neck cracking)

52:56.374 --> 52:57.174
Ah, shit.

53:08.453 --> 53:10.388
Holy fuck!

53:10.421 --> 53:14.392
(trembling)

53:14.425 --> 53:16.427
What the fuck was that?

53:16.461 --> 53:19.264
What the fuck was that?

53:19.297 --> 53:23.368
(trembling)

53:24.435 --> 53:25.703
Holy shit!

53:25.736 --> 53:26.904
Holy shit!

53:26.937 --> 53:28.473
Holy shit!

53:28.506 --> 53:32.477
(gasping)

53:57.502 --> 54:01.472
(screaming)

54:15.820 --> 54:19.324
- [Tony] Where the
fuck are you, Paul?

54:19.357 --> 54:23.494
(creaking)

54:28.366 --> 54:29.767
- I mean, he's not gonna leave

54:29.800 --> 54:31.636
two days before opening night
without saying anything.

54:31.669 --> 54:32.803
- Oh yeah?

54:32.837 --> 54:34.004
2005, he left for
two whole shows

54:34.038 --> 54:35.906
without saying
anything to anybody.

54:35.940 --> 54:36.774
Alright, he's done it before.

54:36.807 --> 54:38.343
He's gonna do it again.

54:38.376 --> 54:39.510
Man, it's just what he does.

54:39.544 --> 54:41.479
- [Tony] C'mon Mac,
that was four years ago.

54:41.512 --> 54:43.381
You're really gonna still
hold that against him?

54:43.414 --> 54:44.915
- You think he's gonna change?

54:44.949 --> 54:45.916
Paul's a fuck up.

54:45.950 --> 54:46.984
That's just what he is.

54:47.017 --> 54:48.386
You can't change that.

54:48.419 --> 54:49.587
- [Tony] No, he set
up half these cameras

54:49.620 --> 54:50.521
in this house himself.

54:50.555 --> 54:51.055
Just hold--

54:51.088 --> 54:52.390
Hold up, guys.

54:52.423 --> 54:55.426
Have either of you
geniuses called him yet?

54:55.460 --> 54:56.594
- I didn't call him.

54:56.627 --> 54:57.562
- I don't think I
have his phone number.

54:57.595 --> 54:58.429
- [Tony] You didn't--

54:58.463 --> 54:59.930
Just give him a call.

54:59.964 --> 55:01.332
Use my phone.

55:01.366 --> 55:02.933
- The point is, he's
not here right now.

55:02.967 --> 55:04.435
- [Tony] Look, all
his shit is upstairs.

55:04.469 --> 55:05.970
- It's ringing.

55:08.539 --> 55:10.475
Paul?

55:11.676 --> 55:13.411
(high pitched screaming
and screeching)

55:13.444 --> 55:13.944
(phone breaking)

55:13.978 --> 55:15.813
- [Tony] Fuck?

55:15.846 --> 55:17.848
What the fuck was that?

55:18.883 --> 55:19.817
Alex.

55:19.850 --> 55:21.519
What was that?

55:21.552 --> 55:23.320
- I don't know.

55:29.927 --> 55:31.762
- Alex!

55:35.433 --> 55:37.435
(eerie piano music)

55:37.468 --> 55:39.003
- Fuck.

55:41.138 --> 55:42.973
Mac?

55:43.007 --> 55:44.842
You hear that right?

55:44.875 --> 55:46.511
I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.

55:46.544 --> 55:48.045
Who is it?

55:48.078 --> 55:49.980
- Maybe Paul?

55:51.582 --> 55:52.717
- What are you guys doing?

55:52.750 --> 55:53.684
Will you stop?

55:53.718 --> 55:55.386
- Someone's downstairs.

55:55.420 --> 55:56.587
We think it might be Paul.

55:56.621 --> 55:58.856
- Stay with Sara, Tony.

55:58.889 --> 56:03.394
(eerie piano music
and creaking steps)

56:11.869 --> 56:12.937
Coming from the front room?

56:12.970 --> 56:13.938
- [Tony] Yeah.

56:13.971 --> 56:15.039
- Okay.

56:19.777 --> 56:22.447
- [Tony] Hey, hey, Mac.

56:22.480 --> 56:23.881
Wait up, man.

56:23.914 --> 56:25.516
- Relax, it's fine.

56:25.550 --> 56:27.652
It's just Paul
fucking with us again.

56:27.685 --> 56:32.022
(creaking and eerie piano music)

56:55.580 --> 56:57.515
Seriously?

57:00.751 --> 57:02.453
Paul?

57:02.487 --> 57:03.220
(keys slamming on piano)

57:03.253 --> 57:04.522
What the fuck was that?

57:04.555 --> 57:05.790
Oh fuck!

57:05.823 --> 57:08.726
(low thumping and yelling)

57:08.759 --> 57:09.960
Paul!

57:12.530 --> 57:13.864
- [Tony] What the fuck?

57:13.898 --> 57:15.666
- Paul, are you in here?

57:15.700 --> 57:16.667
You in here?

57:16.701 --> 57:18.936
- [Tony] Shit!

57:20.270 --> 57:21.906
- Paul!

57:21.939 --> 57:23.708
- [Tony] What the
fuck is going on?

57:23.741 --> 57:28.445
(heavy breathing)

57:29.113 --> 57:31.716
- Jesus fucking Christ, Paul!

57:33.884 --> 57:36.220
- [Tony] Dude, what the fuck.

57:36.253 --> 57:41.091
(creaking steps)

57:41.125 --> 57:42.860
Careful, man.

57:45.262 --> 57:47.498
- We're gonna fucking
die on these steps.

57:51.001 --> 57:52.837
Okay, I'll lock the storm door.

57:52.870 --> 57:53.871
- [Tony] You sure?

57:53.904 --> 57:55.506
- Yeah.

58:07.752 --> 58:09.887
Paul!

58:20.330 --> 58:22.132
Paul!

58:23.768 --> 58:26.671
- [Tony] Fuck!

58:26.704 --> 58:27.972
- You back here?

58:28.005 --> 58:31.008
(heavy breathing)

58:31.041 --> 58:32.610
Paul?

58:36.881 --> 58:39.617
- [Tony] Mac, do
you see anything?

58:40.284 --> 58:41.886
- I don't see anything.

58:41.919 --> 58:43.087
- [Tony] Fuck!

58:43.120 --> 58:47.257
(heavy breathing)

58:52.196 --> 58:54.098
Oh fuck.

58:58.736 --> 58:59.269
Check it.

58:59.303 --> 59:00.170
- What?

59:00.204 --> 59:01.205
- [Tony] Check it.

59:04.208 --> 59:05.776
- [Mac] Nothing.

59:07.812 --> 59:09.046
- [Tony] Fuck!

59:09.079 --> 59:10.047
Go, go, go.

59:10.080 --> 59:11.181
- What?

59:11.215 --> 59:12.717
What?

59:12.750 --> 59:14.785
- [Tony] The clowns!

59:14.819 --> 59:15.920
The fucking clowns!

59:15.953 --> 59:17.788
Their heads!

59:17.822 --> 59:18.923
Oh my god.

59:18.956 --> 59:20.057
Their heads moved.

59:20.090 --> 59:22.760
They were fucking turned.

59:22.793 --> 59:27.364
(heavy breathing)

59:27.397 --> 59:28.365
- [Mac] Tony their
heads don't move.

59:28.398 --> 59:29.333
You told me--

59:29.366 --> 59:31.001
- [Tony] They fucking moved!

59:31.035 --> 59:32.903
Holy fucking shit.

59:32.937 --> 59:33.838
- Tony, look at me.

59:33.871 --> 59:36.006
Do you believe in ghosts?

59:36.040 --> 59:37.007
- [Tony] Yes.

59:37.041 --> 59:37.808
Yeah

59:37.842 --> 59:39.610
- I don't.

59:39.644 --> 59:40.645
Look at me.

59:40.678 --> 59:41.779
Okay?

59:41.812 --> 59:44.749
Now, we're gonna go out there,

59:44.782 --> 59:45.382
and it'll be fine.

59:45.415 --> 59:47.017
- [Tony] No.

59:47.051 --> 59:47.952
No.

59:47.985 --> 59:48.819
- We're gonna go back out there.

59:48.853 --> 59:49.654
We're gonna be fine.

59:49.687 --> 59:51.255
Alright?

59:51.288 --> 59:53.190
- [Tony] You're fucking crazy.

59:53.223 --> 59:55.359
- [Mac] On the count of three.

59:55.392 --> 59:57.061
- [Tony] No, no, just--

59:57.094 --> 01:00:00.097
- [Mac] One, two, three.

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:01.999
(yelling)

01:00:05.202 --> 01:00:06.203
- [Tony] Fuck!

01:00:06.236 --> 01:00:07.972
(screaming)

01:00:08.005 --> 01:00:09.740
They fucking moved.

01:00:09.774 --> 01:00:10.374
I fucking swear.

01:00:10.407 --> 01:00:11.108
- [Mac] I believe you.

01:00:11.141 --> 01:00:11.742
I believe you.

01:00:11.776 --> 01:00:12.376
Okay?

01:00:12.409 --> 01:00:14.078
It's Paul.

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:16.981
He's fucking with us again.

01:00:17.014 --> 01:00:19.183
- [Tony] Dude, I
have it on fucking--

01:00:19.216 --> 01:00:21.085
- [Mac] I don't
know how he got out.

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:22.820
Fuck!

01:00:22.853 --> 01:00:24.054
Paul!

01:00:25.155 --> 01:00:27.357
Holy shit!

01:00:27.391 --> 01:00:29.426
- [Tony] What the fuck?

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:31.662
- Hey, look at me.

01:00:31.696 --> 01:00:34.131
Hey, fuck stick, wake up.

01:00:34.164 --> 01:00:35.165
I know you're fucking with us.

01:00:35.199 --> 01:00:35.966
- [Tony] Paul.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:36.901
Paul, wake up.

01:00:36.934 --> 01:00:38.969
- [Mac] Open your little eyes.

01:00:39.003 --> 01:00:40.905
- [Tony] Paul, oh fuck!

01:00:40.938 --> 01:00:43.708
- [Mac] What the fuck's
wrong with you, huh?

01:00:43.741 --> 01:00:44.909
- [Tony] Shit.

01:00:44.942 --> 01:00:46.744
- [Mac] Why are you
pulling this shit now?

01:00:46.777 --> 01:00:48.312
Everyone's on edge.

01:00:48.345 --> 01:00:50.214
You're just fucking
with us, aren't you?

01:00:50.247 --> 01:00:51.248
Huh?

01:00:51.281 --> 01:00:52.282
- [Tony] Paul, come back.

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:54.151
- [Mac] Fuck him.

01:00:58.789 --> 01:01:00.758
- [Tony] You alright, man?

01:01:00.791 --> 01:01:01.892
- [Mac] C'mon!

01:01:01.926 --> 01:01:03.794
- [Tony] C'mon, man.

01:01:03.828 --> 01:01:04.995
I'm telling you.

01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:06.296
We have to call
it off, right now.

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:07.865
- Why?

01:01:07.898 --> 01:01:08.432
- [Tony] Why?

01:01:08.465 --> 01:01:09.299
- Why?

01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:11.035
- I'll tell you why.

01:01:11.068 --> 01:01:13.270
This clown?

01:01:13.303 --> 01:01:15.172
It's head doesn't fucking turn

01:01:15.205 --> 01:01:17.441
and it turned last night
when we were down here,

01:01:17.474 --> 01:01:19.176
as long with these two as well.

01:01:19.209 --> 01:01:20.444
- [Alex] We're not
shutting down, Tony.

01:01:20.477 --> 01:01:21.812
- Yeah, we're
shutting down, dude.

01:01:21.846 --> 01:01:23.013
It's not safe anymore.

01:01:23.047 --> 01:01:24.181
- [Alex] I'll tell you
what I can't explain

01:01:24.214 --> 01:01:25.850
is how scared you are right now.

01:01:25.883 --> 01:01:26.984
- [Tony] Yeah, I'm
fucking scared.

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:28.385
- [Alex] Paul's back,
Isn't that good?

01:01:28.418 --> 01:01:29.319
- [Tony] Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:29.353 --> 01:01:30.187
Paul's back.

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:31.321
He's technically back.

01:01:31.355 --> 01:01:32.189
But he hasn't said
a fucking word

01:01:32.222 --> 01:01:33.323
since he's been here.

01:01:33.357 --> 01:01:34.725
He just fucking sits there.

01:01:34.759 --> 01:01:36.060
- [Mac] Which pretty
much makes him

01:01:36.093 --> 01:01:37.327
as useless as he always was.

01:01:37.361 --> 01:01:38.963
- [Tony] Fuck you, Mac.

01:01:38.996 --> 01:01:39.997
Fuck you.

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:41.398
You were fucking down here.

01:01:41.431 --> 01:01:42.800
You were down here - [Mac]
What do you want me to say?

01:01:42.833 --> 01:01:44.001
- [Tony] And you saw
what fucking happened,

01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:45.335
and now you're gonna
make a fucking joke

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:48.806
right now to Alex,
your fucking best bud.

01:01:48.839 --> 01:01:50.908
Fuck you, man.

01:01:50.941 --> 01:01:54.378
Explain to me right now how
that fucking head turned.

01:01:54.411 --> 01:01:55.746
- I haven't figured
that part out yet.

01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:56.947
- You haven't fucking
figured it out.

01:01:56.981 --> 01:01:58.148
No shit, you haven't
figured it out!

01:01:58.182 --> 01:02:00.785
There's nothing to figure out.

01:02:00.818 --> 01:02:02.519
It can't fucking
turn, but it did.

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:04.088
- Tony, we don't
have time for this.

01:02:04.121 --> 01:02:05.189
- It's fucking opening
night tomorrow,

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:06.490
I don't fucking care, okay?

01:02:06.523 --> 01:02:07.491
I'm out.

01:02:07.524 --> 01:02:08.826
- Alright, you're quitting?

01:02:08.859 --> 01:02:09.459
That's what this is?

01:02:09.493 --> 01:02:11.028
- [Tony] I'm quitting.

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:13.030
Yeah, write it down in
your stupid fucking book.

01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:14.331
that I'm fucking quitting.
- I'll make sure to date
and sign it for you.

01:02:14.364 --> 01:02:15.399
Aright.

01:02:15.432 --> 01:02:16.466
- [Tony] Fuck you.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.002
Fuck you, Mac.

01:02:18.035 --> 01:02:18.535
- See ya, Tony.

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:20.270
Let him go.

01:02:20.304 --> 01:02:22.306
- [Mac] Hey, hey, hey, Tony!

01:02:25.209 --> 01:02:26.911
Tony!

01:02:26.944 --> 01:02:29.146
Tony, come here!

01:02:29.179 --> 01:02:30.280
Come here.

01:02:30.314 --> 01:02:31.849
- You're a fucking asshole.

01:02:31.882 --> 01:02:32.983
You're a fucking--

01:02:33.017 --> 01:02:34.351
You just stand there?

01:02:34.384 --> 01:02:35.552
- [Mac] Hold on.

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:36.954
You don't understand
everything, alright.

01:02:36.987 --> 01:02:37.888
You don't have all the facts.

01:02:37.922 --> 01:02:38.923
- I don't fucking care.

01:02:38.956 --> 01:02:39.523
- [Mac] You don't understand.

01:02:39.556 --> 01:02:40.925
Stop!

01:02:40.958 --> 01:02:41.458
- [Tony] I'm taking
the fucking sign down.

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:42.860
- [Mac] Stop!

01:02:42.893 --> 01:02:43.994
Look, just listen to
what I have to say,

01:02:44.028 --> 01:02:45.529
and then you can
take off if you want.

01:02:45.562 --> 01:02:46.530
But you need to listen to this.

01:02:46.563 --> 01:02:48.132
You have to hear this.

01:02:48.165 --> 01:02:50.167
- What?

01:02:52.302 --> 01:02:53.470
Jesus.

01:02:53.503 --> 01:02:57.441
(video tuning and
high frequency sounds)

01:03:09.353 --> 01:03:11.388
I can't leave.

01:03:16.326 --> 01:03:18.395
Mac's right.

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:22.466
I can't leave.

01:03:37.047 --> 01:03:38.815
- You okay?

01:03:39.917 --> 01:03:42.953
- No, not really.

01:03:45.189 --> 01:03:48.058
This whole time,

01:03:48.092 --> 01:03:51.628
you knew, but you
didn't tell me.

01:03:55.499 --> 01:03:57.367
- I should've told
you sooner, but--

01:04:00.104 --> 01:04:01.338
- And now--

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:05.042
We're fucked.

01:04:06.043 --> 01:04:08.012
Fucking Alex.

01:04:09.379 --> 01:04:12.416
He fucking screwed us.

01:04:20.457 --> 01:04:24.261
- Does anyone else know?

01:04:25.662 --> 01:04:28.132
- Just me and Alex.

01:04:29.266 --> 01:04:31.235
- You haven't told Sara?

01:04:31.268 --> 01:04:33.203
- No.

01:04:33.237 --> 01:04:35.372
- I know you haven't told Paul.

01:04:35.405 --> 01:04:36.740
- No.

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:42.646
You know what's
really scary though?

01:04:42.679 --> 01:04:44.581
- What?

01:04:44.614 --> 01:04:47.551
- Is why he's not telling him.

01:04:54.691 --> 01:04:57.227
- Well, you're staying,

01:04:57.261 --> 01:04:59.563
so I'll stay.

01:05:03.333 --> 01:05:06.303
I kind of have to.

01:05:06.336 --> 01:05:08.205
- I'm sorry.

01:05:09.339 --> 01:05:12.376
- You're not the one
that should apologize.

01:05:16.513 --> 01:05:18.015
- Alright.

01:05:19.049 --> 01:05:21.118
See you back there?

01:05:21.151 --> 01:05:22.286
- Yeah.

01:05:22.319 --> 01:05:23.620
Sure.

01:05:28.392 --> 01:05:30.727
- [Diane] So, when
opening night arrived,

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:34.464
was there anything technically
wrong with the house?

01:05:34.498 --> 01:05:36.166
Was there any gear or props that

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:39.503
were malfunctioning that
maybe could have hurt someone?

01:05:39.536 --> 01:05:41.138
- No.

01:05:41.171 --> 01:05:42.106
- [Diane] To the best
of your knowledge,

01:05:42.139 --> 01:05:44.641
were you prepared and
ready for opening night?

01:05:44.674 --> 01:05:46.010
- Yeah.

01:05:46.043 --> 01:05:50.447
- [Diane] Was Alex
of sound mind?

01:05:51.381 --> 01:05:53.183
- What do you mean?

01:05:53.217 --> 01:05:55.986
- [Diane] What I mean
to say is, was Alex--

01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:57.687
Was Alex--

01:05:57.721 --> 01:05:59.156
Fit to run the show--

01:05:59.189 --> 01:06:02.059
Was there anything
on management's end

01:06:02.092 --> 01:06:05.295
that maybe could have
caused the tragedy?

01:06:05.329 --> 01:06:08.432
- Alex was the same as always.

01:06:11.368 --> 01:06:14.371
- He did a good job of
rallying the actors,

01:06:14.404 --> 01:06:17.507
and Tony and Mac.

01:06:18.642 --> 01:06:20.744
He told me that
it would be okay,

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.349
and I believed him.

01:06:26.783 --> 01:06:30.787
- [Diane] Sara, why
did you not leave?

01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:37.361
- Alex wasn't gonna
leave the house.

01:06:37.394 --> 01:06:40.230
What was I supposed to do?

01:06:40.264 --> 01:06:42.366
- [Diane] I understand.

01:06:43.567 --> 01:06:44.768
Leading up to that point,

01:06:44.801 --> 01:06:48.004
did you notice anything
that raised any alarms?

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:54.411
- That clown guy that was
running against traffic.

01:06:54.444 --> 01:06:56.246
He shot right past us,

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:58.248
as we neared the basement.

01:06:58.282 --> 01:07:00.117
I remember thinking, "If
this is a part of the show,

01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:01.651
"then it's pretty lame."

01:07:04.288 --> 01:07:07.057
But, of course, it wasn't.

01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:13.263
We got close to the bottom
of the basement steps.

01:07:13.297 --> 01:07:15.365
We couldn't move anymore.

01:07:15.399 --> 01:07:17.401
I mean, nobody could.

01:07:17.434 --> 01:07:19.436
- [Diane] Why?

01:07:22.639 --> 01:07:24.774
- Cause everyone that was
already in the basement

01:07:24.808 --> 01:07:27.711
was trying to get out.

01:07:38.322 --> 01:07:40.524
- I went into Abaddon,

01:07:40.557 --> 01:07:42.292
you know, out of New York.

01:07:42.326 --> 01:07:45.295
Last year was actually

01:07:45.329 --> 01:07:48.198
our biggest opening.

01:07:48.232 --> 01:07:51.501
Even Sara said that--

01:07:55.305 --> 01:07:56.840
- I haven't seen Paul
around in a few days.

01:07:56.873 --> 01:07:58.442
Is he okay or?

01:07:58.475 --> 01:08:00.510
- [Alex] Paul?

01:08:01.378 --> 01:08:02.279
Paul's fine, yeah.

01:08:02.312 --> 01:08:02.846
Why would you--

01:08:02.879 --> 01:08:04.348
Yeah, don't--

01:08:04.381 --> 01:08:05.849
He's a little under the weather,

01:08:05.882 --> 01:08:07.817
but he's okay.

01:08:07.851 --> 01:08:10.120
We'll have to run without him,

01:08:10.154 --> 01:08:12.156
but don't worry about crew.

01:08:12.189 --> 01:08:13.757
We're gonna be--

01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:15.659
We're gonna be alright.

01:08:15.692 --> 01:08:17.261
Scaring some people.

01:08:17.294 --> 01:08:18.595
(laughing)

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:20.564
Let's scare some people tonight.

01:08:23.832 --> 01:08:27.804
A lot of them are gonna
come through here.

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:30.607
- Yeah, great.

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:33.343
Let's get into
costume and makeup

01:08:33.377 --> 01:08:34.678
and go get ready.

01:08:34.711 --> 01:08:35.479
- Awesome.

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:36.345
- Thank you.

01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:36.880
- Awesome.

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:37.881
- Thank you.

01:08:37.913 --> 01:08:39.115
Thanks.

01:08:42.586 --> 01:08:44.520
What's up, man.

01:08:44.554 --> 01:08:46.390
- [Tony] Hey.

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:49.593
I'm sorry.

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:51.495
I know it's been a while.

01:08:51.528 --> 01:08:53.662
But I shouldn't have

01:08:53.697 --> 01:08:56.233
reacted like I did.

01:08:56.265 --> 01:08:57.767
- [Alex] You alright?

01:08:57.801 --> 01:08:59.469
- [Tony] I hope so.

01:08:59.502 --> 01:09:01.337
- [Alex] We're
alright, we're alright.

01:09:01.371 --> 01:09:02.305
Alright?

01:09:02.339 --> 01:09:03.907
You know I can't run
this without you, man.

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:06.310
You know that.

01:09:06.343 --> 01:09:08.345
(creaking)

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:10.380
- [Tony] Paul?

01:09:10.413 --> 01:09:13.350
Yo, Paul.

01:09:13.383 --> 01:09:16.252
Paul, wake up.

01:09:16.286 --> 01:09:19.389
C'mon buddy, wake up.

01:09:21.291 --> 01:09:23.426
Paul.

01:09:33.537 --> 01:09:34.537
Whoa, check it out.

01:09:34.571 --> 01:09:35.705
- How beautiful is this?

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:36.939
- [Tony] Oh, I love it.

01:09:36.973 --> 01:09:38.475
- You can't come over
and not see the sign.

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:39.209
- [Tony] No.

01:09:39.243 --> 01:09:40.210
Not at all.

01:09:40.243 --> 01:09:41.377
- Alright, take a look
at this crowd for me.

01:09:41.411 --> 01:09:42.546
Take a look at this crowd.

01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:43.546
- [Tony] What do
we got down here?

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:45.249
Oh yeah!

01:09:45.282 --> 01:09:46.216
- [Alex] Oh my god!

01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:48.818
- [Tony] Oh, I can't
wait to pee my pants!

01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:52.322
They're gonna be so
scared in a few minutes.

01:09:52.356 --> 01:09:53.723
- [Alex] Oh, good luck
trying to scare me.

01:09:53.756 --> 01:09:56.726
- [Mac] Okay, are
you guys ready to go?

01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.962
- Are you filming right now?

01:09:58.995 --> 01:10:00.597
- [Mac] Yeah, yeah,
we're all set.

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:02.899
You have the keys to
her chains, right?

01:10:02.932 --> 01:10:04.601
Alright, keep an
eye on her, big guy.

01:10:04.634 --> 01:10:05.669
- She's gonna be alright.

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:06.870
- [Mac] Okay.

01:10:06.903 --> 01:10:08.438
Alright.

01:10:08.472 --> 01:10:09.706
Let's have some fun
out there, you guys.

01:10:09.739 --> 01:10:11.275
- Hey, Mac.

01:10:11.308 --> 01:10:13.510
Is everything alright?

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:14.711
- [Mac] Yeah.

01:10:14.744 --> 01:10:16.713
Everything's fine.

01:10:16.746 --> 01:10:19.716
- You would tell me if
something was wrong, right?

01:10:19.749 --> 01:10:20.784
- [Mac] Of course.

01:10:20.817 --> 01:10:23.453
It's not a big deal.

01:10:23.487 --> 01:10:24.654
Okay?

01:10:24.688 --> 01:10:25.522
Alright.

01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:27.524
Let's get goin' guys.

01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:29.493
I'm just gonna get
this finished up.

01:10:29.526 --> 01:10:30.694
Now it might be a little cold.

01:10:30.727 --> 01:10:32.529
I'm sorry.

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.468
- When do people
usually get here?

01:10:38.502 --> 01:10:40.904
- [Mac] We open the doors at 8.

01:10:42.439 --> 01:10:45.442
Alright, I'm just gonna do--

01:10:47.411 --> 01:10:48.745
(laughing)

01:10:48.778 --> 01:10:50.013
- This is so exciting.

01:10:50.046 --> 01:10:51.548
(laughing)

01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:54.017
- [Mac] Alright, here we go.

01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:56.019
- See you later.

01:10:56.052 --> 01:10:58.254
Bye.

01:11:01.391 --> 01:11:06.363
(footsteps on stairs)

01:11:11.401 --> 01:11:13.503
- Hi, Sam, can you hear me?

01:11:15.539 --> 01:11:17.407
We open in exactly 10 minutes.

01:11:17.441 --> 01:11:18.742
I need everybody
ready, in position,

01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:19.676
ready to go.

01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:21.645
You heard from Paul at all?

01:11:21.678 --> 01:11:22.646
- No.

01:11:22.679 --> 01:11:23.880
Still sleeping.

01:11:23.913 --> 01:11:25.749
It's creepy.

01:11:25.782 --> 01:11:28.418
- It's not creepy,
it's annoying.

01:11:28.452 --> 01:11:31.588
Hey, Mac, have you heard
from Paul at all on your end?

01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:33.056
- There he is.

01:11:33.089 --> 01:11:34.758
- [Mac] No.

01:11:34.791 --> 01:11:37.527
- Mac, can you hold down
your button, please,

01:11:37.561 --> 01:11:39.429
when you speak to me.

01:11:42.499 --> 01:11:43.032
Wow.

01:11:43.066 --> 01:11:44.334
- We lost him.

01:11:44.368 --> 01:11:45.502
- That's his
walkie-talkies, man.

01:11:45.535 --> 01:11:48.004
Mac, just start recording
whenever you're ready, alright.

01:11:48.037 --> 01:11:49.406
- I told you to get
the better ones.

01:11:49.439 --> 01:11:49.973
- I thought--

01:11:50.006 --> 01:11:53.343
(feedback)

01:11:53.377 --> 01:11:55.479
- Ask him if he
knows sign language.

01:11:59.583 --> 01:12:01.351
- Alright, get into position.

01:12:01.385 --> 01:12:02.719
We'll talk to you when
this is all over, alright?

01:12:02.752 --> 01:12:04.588
- Alright.

01:12:06.623 --> 01:12:10.460
- Off to a good
start, broken walkies.

01:12:10.494 --> 01:12:13.430
- It'll be alright.

01:12:13.463 --> 01:12:15.732
It's not gonna stop us.

01:12:17.734 --> 01:12:19.603
- Let's go.

01:12:22.606 --> 01:12:24.441
Welcome, everyone.

01:12:24.474 --> 01:12:28.478
(cheering and applause)

01:12:36.786 --> 01:12:39.456
I hope you all
have a reservation.

01:12:39.489 --> 01:12:41.891
No one gets in
without a reservation.

01:12:45.462 --> 01:12:46.062
- A little more mist.

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:47.631
Pump it up, pump it up.

01:12:47.664 --> 01:12:48.798
Alright, all this looks good.

01:12:48.832 --> 01:12:49.633
We're down in bathroom.

01:12:49.666 --> 01:12:51.034
We're down in bathroom.

01:12:51.067 --> 01:12:52.436
Cue steam.

01:12:52.469 --> 01:12:53.670
Love it.

01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:55.872
Alright, we're circling
around the dining room.

01:12:55.905 --> 01:12:58.141
I love the kitchen gag.

01:12:58.174 --> 01:13:01.978
(people talking in line)

01:13:02.011 --> 01:13:04.648
- [Voiceover] We're next,
we're next, we're next.

01:13:06.182 --> 01:13:08.818
- How many people are
they letting in at a time?

01:13:10.887 --> 01:13:12.388
It's a long wait.

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:16.192
(scream in the distance)

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:17.894
- [Mac] Keep the line
moving, you guys,

01:13:17.927 --> 01:13:19.996
I want people in and out.

01:13:20.029 --> 01:13:21.765
- We need some strobe.

01:13:21.798 --> 01:13:24.067
Kick up the strobe
in the rat room.

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:27.737
- A wonderful scare, here we go.

01:13:27.771 --> 01:13:28.838
I love this guy.

01:13:28.872 --> 01:13:30.640
- I think we're next.

01:13:30.674 --> 01:13:31.808
Exciting.

01:13:31.841 --> 01:13:34.578
- We've been waiting for you.

01:13:35.879 --> 01:13:37.947
I hope you all enjoy your stay.

01:13:37.981 --> 01:13:42.452
(creaking and screaming)

01:13:57.634 --> 01:13:58.535
- [Mac] Sara?

01:13:58.568 --> 01:13:59.536
What are you doing?

01:13:59.569 --> 01:14:00.537
- I think I just saw Paul.

01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:01.170
- [Mac] Paul?

01:14:01.204 --> 01:14:02.005
Where?

01:14:02.038 --> 01:14:03.740
- And he looked at me.

01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:05.008
- [Mac] I'll take care of it.

01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:05.742
I'll take care of it.

01:14:05.775 --> 01:14:07.110
Don't worry.

01:14:07.143 --> 01:14:10.046
Joey!

01:14:10.079 --> 01:14:11.147
Alex.

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:12.682
Alex.

01:14:12.716 --> 01:14:14.083
Alex, Joey just ran
out of the basement,

01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:15.552
what's going on down there?

01:14:15.585 --> 01:14:17.153
- There's Joey.

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:19.689
- Where's Joey going?

01:14:19.723 --> 01:14:21.825
Son of a bitch!

01:14:21.858 --> 01:14:23.026
(screaming and creaking)

01:14:23.059 --> 01:14:24.828
- [Sara] Did you hear that?

01:14:24.861 --> 01:14:26.229
What the fuck was that?

01:14:26.262 --> 01:14:30.199
(screaming)

01:14:30.233 --> 01:14:32.268
- [Mac] Go back upstairs and
find out what's going on.

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:34.270
Go, go, go.

01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:39.509
(screaming)

01:14:44.648 --> 01:14:47.651
- Is that supposed to happened?

01:14:47.684 --> 01:14:50.219
- [Voiceover] Technical
difficulties on opening night.

01:14:50.253 --> 01:14:51.988
- [Mac] Alex, come in.

01:14:52.021 --> 01:14:53.623
Alex, I have no eyes
in the basement.

01:14:53.657 --> 01:14:55.158
Something's up.

01:14:55.191 --> 01:14:57.260
Alex.

01:14:57.293 --> 01:14:59.295
Pick up your walkie.

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:04.233
(laughing and talking)

01:15:08.872 --> 01:15:10.239
- [Voiceover] Gross.

01:15:12.642 --> 01:15:15.845
- You have the key,
Joey, get me out of here.

01:15:15.879 --> 01:15:17.614
Please, please,
somebody get help.

01:15:17.647 --> 01:15:19.048
This isn't part of the show.

01:15:19.082 --> 01:15:21.585
Joey!

01:15:21.618 --> 01:15:23.252
Joey, no!

01:15:23.286 --> 01:15:26.255
Joey, don't leave me, please.

01:15:26.289 --> 01:15:28.324
Get me out of here.

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:29.759
(crying)

01:15:29.793 --> 01:15:30.193
- Are you okay?

01:15:30.226 --> 01:15:31.227
- No.

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:33.029
No, this isn't part of the show.

01:15:33.062 --> 01:15:34.030
Please.

01:15:34.063 --> 01:15:35.699
Please, get help.

01:15:35.732 --> 01:15:40.303
(screaming and scrambling)

01:16:53.376 --> 01:16:58.314
(creaking and screaming)

01:17:01.217 --> 01:17:04.287
- [Mac] Go, go, go,
go, go, get out!

01:17:06.222 --> 01:17:08.725
(knocking)

01:17:08.758 --> 01:17:12.161
Hello, anybody?

01:17:12.195 --> 01:17:13.830
Fuck!

01:17:13.863 --> 01:17:17.333
There's another
way out over here.

01:17:17.366 --> 01:17:22.271
(footsteps and loud sirens)

01:17:23.172 --> 01:17:25.041
Tony, Tony, get to the basement.

01:17:25.074 --> 01:17:25.909
- What's going on
in the basement?

01:17:25.942 --> 01:17:27.043
- [Mac] Go!

01:17:30.346 --> 01:17:31.881
- Oh fuck!

01:17:36.452 --> 01:17:39.022
- [Mac] What's going on?

01:17:42.325 --> 01:17:44.293
- [Melissa] Please,
somebody let me out of here.

01:17:44.327 --> 01:17:45.261
- [Mac] Tony!

01:17:45.294 --> 01:17:46.129
Tony!

01:17:46.162 --> 01:17:48.164
(screaming)

01:17:48.197 --> 01:17:49.365
Tony!

01:17:49.398 --> 01:17:54.270
(heaving breathing)

01:17:54.303 --> 01:17:59.308
(sirens and yelling)

01:18:00.076 --> 01:18:01.044
(heavy breathing)

01:18:01.077 --> 01:18:01.911
Go back up.

01:18:01.945 --> 01:18:02.779
Go back up.

01:18:02.812 --> 01:18:03.913
Go!

01:18:07.216 --> 01:18:08.752
Go!

01:18:08.785 --> 01:18:10.253
Attic, attic!

01:18:10.286 --> 01:18:15.291
(footsteps and heavy breathing)

01:18:16.392 --> 01:18:20.096
(screaming)

01:18:20.129 --> 01:18:21.330
Alex!

01:18:21.364 --> 01:18:22.131
Alex!

01:18:22.165 --> 01:18:23.199
C'mon!

01:18:23.232 --> 01:18:27.370
(screaming)

01:18:31.875 --> 01:18:36.712
(scrambled tape and screaming)

01:18:41.284 --> 01:18:46.255
(police and ambulance sirens)

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:59.235
- I came down the
stairs from the attic

01:19:00.169 --> 01:19:02.138
and when I got to the front door

01:19:02.171 --> 01:19:05.208
the police were arriving.

01:19:07.543 --> 01:19:10.413
I was just happy to be alive.

01:19:13.316 --> 01:19:15.084
They didn't ask me any
questions or anything.

01:19:15.118 --> 01:19:18.321
They just rushed me out.

01:19:20.423 --> 01:19:21.991
- [Diane] Nothing
happened to you

01:19:22.025 --> 01:19:24.493
from the attic all the
way to the front door?

01:19:24.527 --> 01:19:27.063
You just left?

01:19:27.096 --> 01:19:28.431
- Yeah.

01:19:30.566 --> 01:19:33.036
- [Diane] How--

01:19:33.069 --> 01:19:36.139
If this is all true, how
was it kept from the public

01:19:36.172 --> 01:19:37.506
for so long?

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:38.441
- I'm sorry,

01:19:38.474 --> 01:19:41.177
I'm just feeling really tired,

01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:43.412
do you think that we
could maybe take a break.

01:19:43.446 --> 01:19:44.280
- [Diane] Of course, of course.

01:19:44.313 --> 01:19:45.148
I'm so sorry.

01:19:45.181 --> 01:19:46.082
Jonathan, will you--

01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:47.817
I keep throwing these
questions at you,

01:19:47.851 --> 01:19:49.986
and I know you've
gotta be exhausted.

01:19:50.019 --> 01:19:50.954
Can we get you water?

01:19:50.987 --> 01:19:53.122
Do you want any water
or anything to eat?

01:19:56.292 --> 01:19:58.995
Well, let's get you
a room to rest in.

01:19:59.028 --> 01:20:00.229
- [Sara] Oh, I
already have a room.

01:20:00.263 --> 01:20:02.899
It's 2C.

01:20:02.932 --> 01:20:04.267
If you could just give
me a couple hours,

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:07.203
you can come find me there.

01:20:07.236 --> 01:20:07.937
- [Diane] I will.

01:20:07.971 --> 01:20:08.972
Thank you.

01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:19.415
Thanks, but it's all boarded up

01:20:19.448 --> 01:20:21.517
and I just can not get a permit.

01:20:28.191 --> 01:20:29.258
Maybe.

01:20:29.292 --> 01:20:30.927
I'll talk to the guys.

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:32.561
Thanks.

01:20:37.566 --> 01:20:38.868
- [Voiceover] I mean, the
place is all boarded up,

01:20:38.902 --> 01:20:40.069
what, are we gonna break in?

01:20:40.103 --> 01:20:41.037
- [Diane] So what,
yeah, why not?

01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:42.438
I mean it's 5 in the morning.

01:20:42.471 --> 01:20:43.973
Nobody's gonna be there.

01:20:44.007 --> 01:20:45.174
- [Voiceover] Yeah,
I'm with Diane.

01:20:45.208 --> 01:20:46.042
I think it'd be worth
it to get inside.

01:20:46.075 --> 01:20:47.010
- [Diane] Thank you.

01:20:47.043 --> 01:20:48.611
What are you afraid of a little

01:20:48.644 --> 01:20:50.546
g-g-g-ghost?

01:20:50.579 --> 01:20:51.514
- [Voiceover] Fine.

01:20:51.547 --> 01:20:52.381
We have one hour, though.

01:20:52.415 --> 01:20:53.249
- [Diane] Perfect.

01:20:53.282 --> 01:20:54.117
- [Voiceover] One hour.

01:20:54.150 --> 01:20:54.884
- [Diane] Can do.

01:20:54.918 --> 01:20:56.085
Grab the camera.

01:20:56.119 --> 01:20:57.086
Will you finish going
through the footage?

01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:57.954
I want to look at it today.

01:20:57.987 --> 01:20:58.621
- [Voiceover] Got it.

01:20:58.654 --> 01:20:59.355
- [Diane] Yes? Good.

01:20:59.388 --> 01:20:59.522
Thank you.

01:21:05.594 --> 01:21:06.996
We're gonna step
out for a minute.

01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:08.497
If the woman in 2C asks for me,

01:21:08.531 --> 01:21:10.499
can you tell her we'll
be back in like an hour?

01:21:10.533 --> 01:21:11.334
- 2C?

01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:12.535
- Yeah.

01:21:12.568 --> 01:21:13.502
- Our rooms don't
have any letters.

01:21:13.536 --> 01:21:16.439
- Um, she did say 2C, right?

01:21:16.472 --> 01:21:17.640
- [Voiceover] Yeah, 2C.

01:21:17.673 --> 01:21:18.975
- Can you tell me what room

01:21:19.008 --> 01:21:20.076
Sara Havel is
staying in, please?

01:21:20.109 --> 01:21:20.609
- Sure.

01:21:20.643 --> 01:21:22.311
- Thank you.

01:21:27.416 --> 01:21:30.219
- There isn't a Sara
Havel staying here.

01:21:33.289 --> 01:21:35.358
- Do you think maybe--

01:21:35.391 --> 01:21:36.926
- [Voiceover]
She's probably just

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:37.927
staying under another
name or something, c'mon.

01:21:37.961 --> 01:21:39.362
- Thank you very much.

01:21:39.395 --> 01:21:40.563
- [Voiceover] Do you wanna
go see this house or not?

01:21:53.409 --> 01:21:58.381
(distant screaming and creaking)

01:22:05.388 --> 01:22:10.293
(gasping and crying)

01:22:20.336 --> 01:22:25.341
(creaking)

01:22:32.381 --> 01:22:36.352
(creaky door opening)

01:22:49.598 --> 01:22:54.270
(footsteps and breathing)

01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:40.349
(kicking and scrambled tape)

01:24:00.369 --> 01:24:05.308
(choking)

01:24:12.315 --> 01:24:17.320
(low growling and whimpering)

01:24:29.432 --> 01:24:34.370
(video tape scratching)

01:25:09.472 --> 01:25:14.310
(choking and gasping)

01:25:19.315 --> 01:25:23.286
(pounding)

01:25:23.319 --> 01:25:26.322
(tape malfunctioning)

01:25:32.461 --> 01:25:34.363
(car door opening)

01:25:39.468 --> 01:25:41.270
- Nobody's around.

01:25:43.406 --> 01:25:46.409
(door creaking)

01:25:55.684 --> 01:25:57.620
- [Voiceover] Are we looking
for anything specific here?

01:25:57.653 --> 01:25:59.288
What are we trying to do?

01:25:59.322 --> 01:26:02.391
- Oh my god!

01:26:03.426 --> 01:26:04.627
Oh my god!

01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:06.895
Do you remember
that this is where--

01:26:06.929 --> 01:26:08.564
- [Voiceover] What?

01:26:17.606 --> 01:26:19.242
- Yeah, this is.

01:26:19.275 --> 01:26:21.644
This a wall where--

01:26:21.677 --> 01:26:23.979
So the kitchen would be--

01:26:24.012 --> 01:26:25.448
- [Voiceover] I feel like
we're getting asbestos

01:26:25.481 --> 01:26:26.715
of something in here.

01:26:26.749 --> 01:26:27.916
Can we get out of here?

01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:31.387
- This is where
the strobe light--

01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:34.690
(creaking door and footsteps)

01:26:34.723 --> 01:26:35.891
- [Voiceover] Kitchen.

01:26:35.924 --> 01:26:38.961
- [Diane] Well, I think the
tour continues that way, right?

01:26:38.994 --> 01:26:39.962
- [Voiceover] I don't
think we're gonna be

01:26:39.995 --> 01:26:41.764
able to go back that way.

01:26:41.797 --> 01:26:45.268
- [Diane] Well, let's
find another way.

01:26:45.301 --> 01:26:47.470
- [Voiceover] Alright.

01:26:48.704 --> 01:26:49.405
- It's the basement.

01:26:49.438 --> 01:26:50.706
(creaking door)

01:26:50.739 --> 01:26:52.341
It's the basement.

01:26:52.375 --> 01:26:53.976
Oh my god!

01:26:54.009 --> 01:26:55.278
Look at the blood!

01:26:55.311 --> 01:26:56.979
Can you see that?

01:26:57.980 --> 01:26:59.715
Get that shot!

01:26:59.748 --> 01:27:00.549
Get that shot!

01:27:00.583 --> 01:27:01.284
Look at that.

01:27:01.317 --> 01:27:02.017
Look at that.

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:02.651
- [Voiceover] Oh, fuck that.

01:27:02.685 --> 01:27:03.286
Let's--

01:27:03.319 --> 01:27:03.719
No.

01:27:03.752 --> 01:27:04.653
I'm not.

01:27:04.687 --> 01:27:05.388
- It looks like a hand print.

01:27:05.421 --> 01:27:05.921
Look here.

01:27:05.954 --> 01:27:07.323
Do you see it?

01:27:07.356 --> 01:27:07.856
- [Voiceover] I
don't give a shit.

01:27:07.890 --> 01:27:08.457
Let's not.

01:27:08.491 --> 01:27:08.991
Nope.

01:27:09.024 --> 01:27:09.858
Let's just go.

01:27:09.892 --> 01:27:11.260
- Okay, you're right.

01:27:11.294 --> 01:27:11.994
- [Voiceover] Hey,
let's go in here.

01:27:12.027 --> 01:27:12.728
- Careful, watch your foot.

01:27:12.761 --> 01:27:13.929
Watch your foot.

01:27:13.962 --> 01:27:15.764
This is where they had
the bartender there.

01:27:15.798 --> 01:27:17.433
- [Voiceover] Oh fuck.

01:27:17.466 --> 01:27:18.701
- It's all fake, right?

01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:22.771
Oh.

01:27:26.709 --> 01:27:27.610
Alright, c'mon.

01:27:27.643 --> 01:27:29.645
We gotta find the kitchen.

01:27:29.678 --> 01:27:31.347
- [Voiceover] Yeah,
I don't want to--

01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:32.381
- Watch this, watch this guy.

01:27:32.415 --> 01:27:34.783
Oh man.

01:27:39.522 --> 01:27:41.390
C'mon.

01:27:41.424 --> 01:27:42.891
- [Voiceover] Maybe it
just goes round and round.

01:27:42.925 --> 01:27:44.460
- Look how dumb, look here.

01:27:44.493 --> 01:27:45.494
- [Voiceover] Ah, fuck.

01:27:45.528 --> 01:27:46.662
- This is insane.

01:27:46.695 --> 01:27:48.397
Oh my god.

01:27:48.431 --> 01:27:50.499
- [Voiceover] Alright,
no, that doesn't--

01:27:50.533 --> 01:27:51.467
(piano keys)

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:52.301
Right, of course it does.

01:27:52.335 --> 01:27:53.035
That makes sense.

01:27:53.068 --> 01:27:54.002
- Oh, don't be such a pussy.

01:27:54.036 --> 01:27:54.970
C'mon, we're not even--

01:27:55.003 --> 01:27:57.506
- [Voiceover] Can you
just like slow down?

01:27:57.540 --> 01:27:58.741
- Hey, get this.

01:27:58.774 --> 01:28:00.843
Oh my god!

01:28:00.876 --> 01:28:02.878
Look at that shit.

01:28:02.911 --> 01:28:04.847
Look at them.

01:28:07.883 --> 01:28:10.319
(laughing)

01:28:10.353 --> 01:28:10.986
Oh my god.

01:28:11.019 --> 01:28:12.555
- [Voiceover] Who is it?

01:28:12.588 --> 01:28:13.322
- It's Mitchell, I'll
call him on the way back.

01:28:13.356 --> 01:28:14.490
C'mon.

01:28:14.523 --> 01:28:16.325
That would take us to the other
end of the kitchen, maybe?

01:28:16.359 --> 01:28:17.493
If we--

01:28:17.526 --> 01:28:18.827
That's not it.

01:28:18.861 --> 01:28:20.963
- [Voiceover] It's the
stairs, right there.

01:28:20.996 --> 01:28:22.498
- We gotta go up the stairs.

01:28:22.531 --> 01:28:24.967
- [Voiceover] Yeah,
sure, of course we do.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.405
(footsteps on creaky steps.)

01:28:29.438 --> 01:28:31.540
- See the security
cameras everywhere?

01:28:31.574 --> 01:28:33.576
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

01:28:33.609 --> 01:28:35.544
- So this locks.

01:28:35.578 --> 01:28:37.480
- [Voiceover] That's
fucking creepy.

01:28:37.513 --> 01:28:37.946
Hold on, let me turn this lamp--

01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:39.448
- Fuck.

01:28:39.482 --> 01:28:41.750
- [Voiceover] What is that?

01:28:41.784 --> 01:28:44.553
- She said 2C, right?

01:28:44.587 --> 01:28:45.454
- [Voiceover] What the fuck?

01:28:45.488 --> 01:28:47.122
- I mean, do you think--

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:48.624
I mean--

01:28:48.657 --> 01:28:49.858
- [Voiceover] No, what?

01:28:49.892 --> 01:28:52.060
Don't fucking open that!

01:28:52.094 --> 01:28:54.430
- It's what we're here for.

01:28:54.463 --> 01:28:55.631
We're here to--

01:28:55.664 --> 01:28:56.565
- [Voiceover] We're
not here to fucking

01:28:56.599 --> 01:28:57.566
go into a creepy ass room.

01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:58.801
- I am.

01:28:58.834 --> 01:28:59.968
- [Voiceover] Diane!

01:29:00.002 --> 01:29:00.703
Diane, don't.

01:29:00.736 --> 01:29:01.770
- Shut up.

01:29:01.804 --> 01:29:03.472
Oh my god!

01:29:10.646 --> 01:29:12.715
C'mon, on me.

01:29:14.617 --> 01:29:16.118
- [Voiceover] Don't
fucking go in there.

01:29:16.151 --> 01:29:17.085
- Sara?

01:29:17.119 --> 01:29:19.522
Honey, are you okay?

01:29:19.555 --> 01:29:20.956
- [Voiceover] Don't.

01:29:20.989 --> 01:29:23.492
- Sara.

01:29:25.928 --> 01:29:26.862
- [Voiceover] Let's
get the fuck out--

01:29:26.895 --> 01:29:27.596
(door slamming and screaming)

01:29:27.630 --> 01:29:28.431
Holy fuck!

01:29:28.464 --> 01:29:28.964
- [Diane] Oh my god!

01:29:28.997 --> 01:29:29.698
Oh my god!

01:29:29.732 --> 01:29:31.600
Help me!

01:29:31.634 --> 01:29:32.801
Oh my god!

01:29:32.835 --> 01:29:33.736
- [Voiceover] What
the fuck is that?

01:29:33.769 --> 01:29:38.006
(screaming and video scrambling)

01:29:46.114 --> 01:29:50.919
(eerie piano music)

01:30:03.499 --> 01:30:06.502
(haunting instrumental music)
