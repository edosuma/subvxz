WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:03.333
I gotta get goin'

00:03.333 --> 00:06.875
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.333
he's just Pooh Bear

00:13.958 --> 00:17.458
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.458 --> 00:20.875
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:28.000
we're so adventurous

00:28.000 --> 00:31.166
and again

00:31.166 --> 00:34.833
and there's nobody home

00:34.833 --> 00:38.250
to count on a friend

00:38.250 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.833 --> 00:45.250
take me, please?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.708
I got to be there

00:50.708 --> 00:55.875
Winnie the Pooh

01:11.958 --> 01:14.958
Hmm. Piglet,
I don't mean to pry,

01:14.958 --> 01:17.708
but how long before
holding honey

01:17.708 --> 01:20.458
becomes eating honey?

01:20.458 --> 01:21.958
I'm sorry, Pooh,

01:21.958 --> 01:23.416
but, being such
a very small animal,

01:23.416 --> 01:25.416
it takes a large
amount of painting

01:25.416 --> 01:27.583
to make a Pooh small enough
for my mantel.

01:27.583 --> 01:29.458
Oh, bother.

01:29.458 --> 01:31.000
Pooh?

01:31.000 --> 01:32.166
Pooh?

01:32.166 --> 01:34.583
I'm sorry, Piglet.

01:34.583 --> 01:38.208
I think my foot
went to sleep without me.

01:39.375 --> 01:40.750
I'm almost done, Pooh.

01:40.750 --> 01:42.166
I'll hurry.

01:42.166 --> 01:44.458
Dear!

01:44.458 --> 01:46.708
My painting of you is gone.

01:46.708 --> 01:48.750
Hello, there,
fellow artistes.

01:49.875 --> 01:52.458
It's brilliant, genius.

01:52.458 --> 01:54.083
Looks like polar bears

01:54.083 --> 01:56.125
eating marshmallows
in a snowstorm.

01:56.125 --> 01:58.750
Oh, but it's not supposed
to be polar bears, Tigger.

01:58.750 --> 02:00.125
It was a picture of Pooh.

02:00.125 --> 02:03.083
It's true. I was there.

02:03.083 --> 02:05.458
And now I'm...gone.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.583
Aren't I?

02:06.583 --> 02:09.000
Hmm. Pooh poachers, eh?

02:09.000 --> 02:12.416
Yes. And nobody
at all was around.

02:12.416 --> 02:15.500
Aha! Of course
nobody was there,

02:15.500 --> 02:19.083
and nobody is who pilfered
Piglet's Pooh picture.

02:19.083 --> 02:20.166
It was?

02:20.166 --> 02:21.625
Absoposilutely.

02:21.625 --> 02:23.750
And nobody knows nobodies

02:23.750 --> 02:25.500
like I know nobodies.

02:25.500 --> 02:28.750
Come on. Let's find us
that nobody.

02:28.750 --> 02:31.708
Well, Tigger, how
shall we catch him

02:31.708 --> 02:33.750
if we can't see him?

02:33.750 --> 02:36.000
That's easy. Hoo hoo hoo!

02:36.000 --> 02:38.458
You got to sniff him out.

02:38.458 --> 02:40.291
Topeka!

02:47.375 --> 02:51.416
It's the dreaded
long-eared nobody.

02:51.416 --> 02:55.750
Long-eared nobodies look
a great deal like Rabbit.

02:55.750 --> 02:57.750
That's because I am Rabbit.

02:57.750 --> 02:59.708
An unlikely story.

02:59.708 --> 03:03.583
Tigger, this is my garden,
and I'm Rabbit.

03:03.583 --> 03:07.125
Hmm. His tail does
look awfully fluffy

03:07.125 --> 03:08.208
for a nobody.

03:08.208 --> 03:10.458
What on earth is a nobody?

03:10.458 --> 03:12.708
Somebody who's not there

03:12.708 --> 03:15.875
but takes your paintings
anyway.

03:15.875 --> 03:17.583
I'm surprised
at all of you,

03:17.583 --> 03:19.875
believing in unseen
creatures like--

03:19.875 --> 03:21.625
like nobodies.

03:21.625 --> 03:23.708
But one of them
stole my painting.

03:23.708 --> 03:25.250
Don't be silly.

03:25.250 --> 03:28.000
There's a reasonable
explanation for everything.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.333
There is?

03:29.333 --> 03:32.583
Sure. Hoo! And when we
find the nobody,

03:32.583 --> 03:34.833
he'll tell us what it is.
Hoo hoo hoo!

03:36.583 --> 03:40.375
Hmph. Nobodies. Ha. The idea.

03:51.583 --> 03:52.875
Shh!

04:03.583 --> 04:06.083
Hoo hoo! That was close.

04:06.083 --> 04:07.708
echo:
That was close.

04:07.708 --> 04:09.083
You're telling me.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.125
Who's telling you,
Tigger?

04:11.125 --> 04:12.958
There's nobody around.

04:12.958 --> 04:16.000
That's it. A nobody.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.416
Tigger, that nobody sounds
a great deal like you.

04:19.416 --> 04:22.708
It's because nobodies are
real sneaky-pants types.

04:22.708 --> 04:24.875
They'll steal anything
that isn't nailed down--

04:24.875 --> 04:26.333
-- even voices.

04:26.333 --> 04:28.500
But I'm not afraid.

04:28.500 --> 04:31.250
It's time for Plan T!

04:31.250 --> 04:33.625
T stands for Tigger,
by the way.

04:38.250 --> 04:39.750
Gotcha!

04:41.458 --> 04:44.583
echo: Gotcha!

04:46.583 --> 04:49.458
Tigger's shouting a great deal
more quietly than before.

04:49.458 --> 04:53.625
Perhaps it is part of Plan T.

04:54.833 --> 04:56.416
Pooh, I think he's trying

04:56.416 --> 04:58.375
to tell us
he lost his voice.

05:00.083 --> 05:02.875
Then why
didn't he just say so

05:02.875 --> 05:04.083
in the first place?

05:04.083 --> 05:06.416
Pooh, remember
what Tigger said

05:06.416 --> 05:08.000
about nobodies being sneaky?

05:08.000 --> 05:10.458
Why, yes, Piglet, I do.

05:10.458 --> 05:13.000
Tigger didn't
lose his voice.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.125
That nobody who
sounded so very much
like Tigger took it.

05:17.125 --> 05:19.625
Oh, the same one
who took my painting.

05:19.625 --> 05:22.000
How will we ever
find him, Pooh?

05:22.000 --> 05:25.708
I suppose the best place
to find a nobody

05:25.708 --> 05:28.333
is nowhere in particular.

05:32.625 --> 05:34.458
Now wait just a minute.

05:34.458 --> 05:38.583
I'm sure I had some carrots
right here and there.

05:38.583 --> 05:41.166
Nobody could have taken them.

05:41.166 --> 05:42.875
I've been here all--

05:43.875 --> 05:46.458
Did I say nobody?

05:46.458 --> 05:49.083
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

05:54.250 --> 05:57.250
Jumping crawdaddies! Guests!

05:57.250 --> 06:01.000
Say, who'd be messing
around down here

06:01.000 --> 06:03.708
without bothering
to say hello?

06:05.250 --> 06:07.875
My tools! They're gone!

06:07.875 --> 06:10.875
Thieves! Tunnel invaders!

06:10.875 --> 06:14.583
Well, they won't get
back in here again.

06:14.583 --> 06:17.583
Heh heh heh heh heh heh.
Let's see them try

06:17.583 --> 06:20.708
After I seal up
the north tunnel.

06:24.333 --> 06:26.708
Pooh, Tigger's
not talking again.

06:26.708 --> 06:29.583
He says look...out...

06:29.583 --> 06:32.875
for...the...hole--

06:32.875 --> 06:37.375
Ohh!

06:40.208 --> 06:43.291
Listening to Tigger not talk

06:43.291 --> 06:45.458
is more dangerous
than I thought.

06:45.458 --> 06:49.083
We'd better get some help
finding his voice.

06:49.083 --> 06:53.708
Aha! Caught you,
you tool-snatching varmints.

06:53.708 --> 06:58.291
Think they're so smart,
do they? Hmm!

06:58.291 --> 06:59.875
Well, I'll show them.

06:59.875 --> 07:01.625
That's the last time

07:01.625 --> 07:05.166
they'll use the south tunnels.

07:05.166 --> 07:09.750
Huh. There's a reasonable
explanation for everything.

07:09.750 --> 07:12.708
Things just don't disappear.

07:14.208 --> 07:16.875
I'm certain Rabbit will
help find the nobody

07:16.875 --> 07:18.458
that took Tigger's voice,

07:18.458 --> 07:20.875
even if he doesn't
believe in them.

07:34.333 --> 07:38.250
Tigger, what are you doing
with my vegetables?

07:39.625 --> 07:41.083
No, no, no.

07:41.083 --> 07:42.958
Excuses won't do you any good.

07:42.958 --> 07:44.708
I saw you.

07:44.708 --> 07:47.125
I knew there was
a reasonable explanation.

07:47.125 --> 07:49.750
But, Rabbit,
Tigger says

07:49.750 --> 07:52.833
he was saving
your vegebibbles

07:52.833 --> 07:54.125
from the nobody.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.750
Not that nobody
business again.

07:56.750 --> 07:59.583
Have you not seen one
around, Rabbit,

07:59.583 --> 08:01.750
that perhaps
sounds like Tigger?

08:01.750 --> 08:05.458
Oh, certainly. I don't
see them all the time.

08:05.458 --> 08:07.875
Who do you think
I grow my vegetables for?

08:07.875 --> 08:10.958
Here. Have a carrot.
Be my guest.

08:10.958 --> 08:13.000
Please. I insist.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.333
Perhaps we'd better
come back later

08:15.333 --> 08:17.875
to ask Rabbit
about Tigger's nobody.

08:17.875 --> 08:21.708
He seems to be busy with
his own nobodies right now.

08:23.875 --> 08:26.958
- What the ding-dangy--

08:26.958 --> 08:29.958
Uhh, now they're
in the east tunnels.

08:29.958 --> 08:33.458
I was positive I had
more cabbages than this.

08:33.458 --> 08:36.875
There is a reasonable
explanation for all this.

08:36.875 --> 08:38.375
Isn't there?

08:38.375 --> 08:41.166
Hello, Rabbit.
We're back again.

08:41.166 --> 08:45.000
Ha ha. Yes. Your nobodies
are the only ones we can find.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.375
For the last time,
I don't have any nobodies.

08:49.375 --> 08:51.708
Then who's taking those?

08:51.708 --> 08:55.375
Aah! My tomatoes!
Where'd they go?

08:55.375 --> 08:58.333
I think we're
about to find out.

08:58.333 --> 09:01.083
Oh, d-d-dear.

09:01.083 --> 09:03.333
Oh! No! They're gone!

09:03.333 --> 09:06.458
And nobody was around.

09:06.458 --> 09:08.208
Nobodies!

09:08.208 --> 09:10.625
It's every vegetable
for himself!

09:13.875 --> 09:16.833
Well, that ought
to take care--

09:16.833 --> 09:18.000
Uhh!

09:18.000 --> 09:19.625
Uh, that tears it.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.333
They're everywhere.

09:21.333 --> 09:24.125
Have to seal up
the northwest tunnels

09:24.125 --> 09:26.083
an the southeast tunnels.

09:26.083 --> 09:29.416
You know, those vegetable
stealing nobodies

09:29.416 --> 09:31.583
certainly looked familiar.

09:31.583 --> 09:34.583
Crows aren't nobodies,
Pooh. They're crows.

09:34.583 --> 09:38.583
Now what would crows want
with Tigger's voice?

09:38.583 --> 09:40.500
An how will we
ever find it

09:40.500 --> 09:42.458
with all these
vegetables in the way?

09:42.458 --> 09:46.750
Perhaps, if we put back
Rabbit's vegetables first,

09:46.750 --> 09:49.875
we can find Tigger's voice
and put it back

09:49.875 --> 09:52.500
the number after first.

09:53.625 --> 09:55.500
--

09:55.500 --> 09:57.750
what comes down must go up.

09:57.750 --> 10:02.291
This vegetable-napping is
going to stop here and now.

10:02.291 --> 10:05.166
No! The nobodies!
They're back!

10:06.458 --> 10:10.000
Let's see them
sneak through this.

10:12.458 --> 10:14.750
Pooh? Piglet? Tigger?

10:14.750 --> 10:16.416
Nobody's here.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.583
And nobody blew up my garden.

10:18.583 --> 10:20.125
Hello, Rabbit.

10:20.125 --> 10:23.291
Your vegetables went up
more than we thought,

10:23.291 --> 10:25.458
but at least you've
gotten them back.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.291
Yes. We saved
them from the crows.

10:28.291 --> 10:30.583
Crows took my vegetables?

10:30.583 --> 10:34.083
Oh, yes. You see,
it all started

10:34.083 --> 10:37.000
when the nobody
took Piglet's Pooh.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
And then the crows
took Tigger's voice

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
and hid it
with your vegetables,

10:42.000 --> 10:44.875
which they kept under
the ground, of course.

10:44.875 --> 10:48.750
So you see, Rabbit,
you were right all the time.

10:48.750 --> 10:53.291
There is a reasonable
explanation for everything.

10:53.291 --> 10:55.166
Look! My painting.

10:55.166 --> 10:57.333
Tigger: I liked the
polar bear one better.

10:57.333 --> 10:59.583
Why, Tigger, you can talk.

10:59.583 --> 11:01.333
Of course. Hoo hoo!

11:01.333 --> 11:03.458
It's what tiggers do
the best, you know.

11:03.458 --> 11:05.208
My voice must have found me

11:05.208 --> 11:07.291
when I was putting back
your vegebibbles.

11:07.291 --> 11:09.958
Maybe I was the one
who was lost all the time.

11:09.958 --> 11:11.000
Hoo hoo!

11:11.000 --> 11:12.458
By ding-dangy,

11:12.458 --> 11:14.083
that showed them. Ha!

11:14.083 --> 11:18.000
Say, what's wrong with Rabbit?

11:18.000 --> 11:20.083
He looks a bit frazzled.

11:20.083 --> 11:22.708
Nobodies took Piglets Pooh

11:22.708 --> 11:24.625
and then Tigger's voice,

11:24.625 --> 11:26.250
then my vegetables.

11:26.250 --> 11:28.458
But the nobodies were nobody

11:28.458 --> 11:30.458
because it was crows?

11:30.458 --> 11:33.833
Huh. Must have been
something I didn't say.

11:44.208 --> 11:47.458
No, no, no, Tigger.
Don't put that there.

11:47.458 --> 11:48.875
Put that there.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.208
Quickly, everyone,

11:50.208 --> 11:51.708
or we'll never finish

11:51.708 --> 11:54.291
before Cassie comes home.

12:02.958 --> 12:05.000
Do you like the flower
arrangement, Rabbit?

12:05.000 --> 12:06.875
A very nice
arrangement, Piglet,

12:06.875 --> 12:09.000
but it needs
some flowers.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
Now, I want daffodils,
daisies, and jonquils,

12:13.000 --> 12:15.375
but no dandelions.

12:15.375 --> 12:17.875
Dandelions, daisies,
and jonquils,

12:17.875 --> 12:19.416
but no daffodils.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.583
That's not
what we're here for.

12:23.583 --> 12:27.583
Uh, what are we here
for, huh, Stan?

12:27.583 --> 12:29.375
Quiet, bubble brain.

12:29.375 --> 12:32.458
I believe I hear
opportunity knocking.

12:34.875 --> 12:38.250
Do you suppose this will
be enough of my honey

12:38.250 --> 12:40.000
for your party, Rabbit?

12:40.000 --> 12:42.750
We need two honey cakes,

12:42.750 --> 12:44.333
three loaves of honey bread,

12:44.333 --> 12:47.000
and dozens and dozens
of honey cookies.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.500
Well, uh, we can
always get more.

12:50.500 --> 12:53.291
I was afraid
you might say that.

12:53.291 --> 12:57.291
Uh, Rabbit, exactly
what is this party

12:57.291 --> 12:59.250
for which we must
be ready?

12:59.250 --> 13:00.958
The welcome home party

13:00.958 --> 13:03.583
for my dear little Cassie,

13:03.583 --> 13:06.416
who's finally coming home
where she belongs.

13:06.416 --> 13:09.083
So her party must be perfect.

13:10.583 --> 13:13.833
Now I know what we're
after: honey.

13:13.833 --> 13:16.416
Oh, boy. Hee hee! Ha ha!

13:16.416 --> 13:18.625
I just love honey. Ho ho!

13:18.625 --> 13:20.333
How are we gonna
get it, Stan? Huh?

13:20.333 --> 13:21.583
Ho ho! How? How?

13:21.583 --> 13:23.750
Pipe own while I
figure it out.

13:23.750 --> 13:26.583
Hurry, Pooh Bear.
She'll be here any minute.

13:26.583 --> 13:28.583
Here are the dandelions
you asked for, Rabbit.

13:28.583 --> 13:30.750
No, not dandelions.

13:30.750 --> 13:32.625
Dandelions make me--

13:32.625 --> 13:34.458
ah-choo!

13:35.458 --> 13:37.208
No, no, no!

13:37.208 --> 13:39.333
I will not have
this party ruined!

13:39.333 --> 13:41.125
Clean up that honey.

13:41.125 --> 13:43.708
Get rid of those dandelions.
More balloons!

13:43.708 --> 13:44.708
Set the table.

13:44.708 --> 13:46.625
Everything must be perfect

13:46.625 --> 13:48.958
- to welcome home--
- Hello, everyone.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.375
Cassie!

13:50.375 --> 13:53.208
Why, you're--
you're-- you're you.

13:53.208 --> 13:56.291
And you're here,
Cassie, at last.

13:56.291 --> 13:59.166
Hmm. Maybe that little birdie

13:59.166 --> 14:02.000
is the meal ticket
we've been looking for.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.958
Come on. We got plans to plan.

14:04.958 --> 14:09.083
Oh, Cassie, I had
a welcome home party
all planned, but--

14:09.083 --> 14:11.166
It was going to be colossical

14:11.166 --> 14:13.208
with half a gazillion
balloons.

14:13.208 --> 14:14.875
Heh heh. And flowers.

14:14.875 --> 14:16.333
And honey.

14:16.333 --> 14:17.875
Oh, bother.

14:17.875 --> 14:19.250
That's okay, Rabbit.

14:19.250 --> 14:21.166
It's nice just being here.

14:21.166 --> 14:25.833
Rabbit? But you used to
call me Rabby. Remember?

14:25.833 --> 14:27.875
I'm too old for that.

14:27.875 --> 14:29.833
Oh, no, Cassie.

14:29.833 --> 14:33.208
You'll always be
my little baby bird.

14:33.208 --> 14:35.708
But what matters now
is you're back,

14:35.708 --> 14:37.625
back to stay forever.

14:37.625 --> 14:39.750
Forever?

14:39.750 --> 14:41.875
But, uh, Rabbit--

14:41.875 --> 14:43.875
Welcome home, Cassie.

14:43.875 --> 14:45.583
How I've missed you.

14:45.583 --> 14:50.000
I guess I could stay
for a little while.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.416
Uh, I got it, Stan.
I got it.

14:54.416 --> 14:55.875
We give them honey,

14:55.875 --> 14:57.708
an they give us the bird.

14:58.708 --> 15:00.458
Nah, that's not it, either.

15:00.458 --> 15:03.583
Uh, how about
we grab the rabbit

15:03.583 --> 15:06.750
and we switch him
for the bird? Heh heh.

15:06.750 --> 15:09.083
Nope. Getting closer,
though.

15:09.083 --> 15:12.000
Rabbit certainly is
glad Cassie's back.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.500
Yeah, but I don't think
she's so glad about it.

15:15.500 --> 15:18.875
I believe that's because
Rabbit hasn't noticed

15:18.875 --> 15:22.291
that Cassie isn't quite
as, uh, Cassie-like

15:22.291 --> 15:23.583
since she came back.

15:23.583 --> 15:25.708
She's grown up.

15:25.708 --> 15:30.166
Yes, Cassie, dear, it's going
to be just like old times.

15:30.166 --> 15:32.833
I'm too old
for old times.

15:32.833 --> 15:34.333
I'm grown up.

15:34.333 --> 15:36.750
Of course you are, dear.

15:36.750 --> 15:40.166
I just love it when you
pretend you're a big girl.

15:40.166 --> 15:42.250
Now it's nappy time.

15:42.250 --> 15:45.625
But, Rabbit, I don't
take naps anymore.

15:45.625 --> 15:47.333
Good night,
Cassie, dear.

15:47.333 --> 15:49.000
Sleep well.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.958
Good night, Rabbit.

15:50.958 --> 15:52.958
I guess the only way
to convince Rabbit

15:52.958 --> 15:55.000
I'm old enough
to take care of myself

15:55.000 --> 15:58.083
is to go away and
take care of myself.

15:59.958 --> 16:04.000
Come on, Stan, uh, explain
how I said it again.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.125
Okay, but this is
the last time.

16:07.125 --> 16:09.583
We get the bird in our hands,

16:09.583 --> 16:12.833
then trade her back
to the rabbit for honey.

16:12.833 --> 16:16.958
Oh! Oh!
You're brilliant, Stan!

16:16.958 --> 16:19.458
Brilliant!

16:19.458 --> 16:22.625
But how do we get the little
birdie in our hands?

16:22.625 --> 16:24.375
Excuse me.

16:24.375 --> 16:26.291
Do you know if there
are any vacant nests

16:26.291 --> 16:27.458
around here?

16:28.833 --> 16:31.708
Cassie, dear, time to get
ready for dinner.

16:33.625 --> 16:36.291
Ah, it's play time, is it?

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Hide and seek?

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
Here I come, ready or not.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.500
Cassie, you really shouldn't
play this far from home.

16:46.500 --> 16:49.583
All right, Cassie,
play time is over.

16:50.625 --> 16:54.000
Cassie! You come out
this moment!

16:54.000 --> 16:55.375
Cassie!

16:57.708 --> 16:59.500
Cassie? Where are--

16:59.500 --> 17:00.958
you?

17:02.000 --> 17:03.458
Heh heh.

17:03.458 --> 17:06.875
Haven't seen a little bird
around, have you?

17:06.875 --> 17:10.000
You see the sort of trouble
you get yourself into

17:10.000 --> 17:12.708
when you don't let me
take care of you?

17:12.708 --> 17:15.708
Guess you'll want to be
ransoming her now, huh?

17:15.708 --> 17:19.083
Uh, ransom?
Certainly not

17:19.083 --> 17:21.375
because, in order
for there to be a ransom,

17:21.375 --> 17:23.583
there must first
be a ransom note.

17:23.583 --> 17:25.625
Knew we forgot something.

17:34.125 --> 17:36.208
I found this note on my door,

17:36.208 --> 17:39.125
and I'm fairly certain
I didn't put it there.

17:39.125 --> 17:41.000
What does it say, Pooh?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.458
I believe we shall
have to reed it.

17:43.458 --> 17:45.750
Why, hoo hoo,
it's obliviously

17:45.750 --> 17:47.875
a "Happy birthday,
Tigger" kind of card.

17:47.875 --> 17:50.708
Or it could be
an invitation to breakfast

17:50.708 --> 17:53.416
or lunch or dinner.

17:53.416 --> 17:54.875
I'm not particular.

17:54.875 --> 17:57.291
Perhaps we should
ask Rabbit to read it.

17:58.291 --> 17:59.458
Hello!

17:59.458 --> 18:01.125
Anybody home?

18:01.125 --> 18:03.250
Or perhaps, Tigger,

18:03.250 --> 18:05.458
since Rabbit and Cassie
are not here,

18:05.458 --> 18:08.750
this note is from them
telling us where they are.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.458
That's it, buddy bear.

18:10.458 --> 18:12.000
Let's go find them

18:12.000 --> 18:14.458
so they can tell us where
the note say they are.

18:14.458 --> 18:16.375
- Cassie!
- Rabbit.

18:16.375 --> 18:18.000
Why, there's no telling

18:18.000 --> 18:20.458
what kind of danger's
lurking out here.

18:20.458 --> 18:21.458
Yipes!

18:26.250 --> 18:28.416
You're safer
than safe with me.

18:28.416 --> 18:29.583
Hoo hoo hoo!

18:29.583 --> 18:33.416
Uh, Pooh? Pigalet? Oops!

18:33.416 --> 18:35.750
So nice you could drop by

18:35.750 --> 18:38.458
on account of that means
that many more ransoms

18:38.458 --> 18:40.958
and that much more honey
for us.

18:40.958 --> 18:43.458
But if we're here,
who's left to ransom us?

18:43.458 --> 18:46.125
Mm. Never thought of that.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.291
There's got to be
somebody somewhere

18:48.291 --> 18:49.583
to ransom you.

18:49.583 --> 18:52.333
Uh, perhaps
we could ransom us.

18:55.208 --> 18:57.708
"Perhaps we could ransom us?"

18:57.708 --> 19:00.750
Honestly, Pooh Bear,
if you'd kept quiet,

19:00.750 --> 19:02.708
they'd have let us go.

19:02.708 --> 19:04.875
I'm very sorry, Cassie.

19:04.875 --> 19:07.875
I promised
I'd take care of you,

19:07.875 --> 19:09.125
and I failed.

19:09.125 --> 19:10.833
Don't worry, Rabbit.

19:10.833 --> 19:13.375
Stan and Hef are going
to take care of me now.

19:13.375 --> 19:14.750
They are?

19:14.750 --> 19:16.333
Both: We are?

19:16.333 --> 19:18.291
Yes. In fact,

19:18.291 --> 19:20.333
you're going to take
care of all of us.

19:20.333 --> 19:23.750
Now, why in the world
would we want to do
that, little birdie?

19:23.750 --> 19:25.500
Because
if we're not happy,

19:25.500 --> 19:27.833
why should we bother to pay
honey for ourselves?

19:27.833 --> 19:31.375
Why, that's so confusing,
even I understand it.

19:31.375 --> 19:34.875
Heh heh. She's right,
Stan. She's right.

19:34.875 --> 19:37.875
I know she's right,
honey breath. Big deal.

19:37.875 --> 19:41.166
How hard can taking
care of this bunch be?

19:41.166 --> 19:42.958
The first thing
you should know

19:42.958 --> 19:44.250
is that it's
our nap time.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.000
Uh, nap time?

19:46.000 --> 19:47.875
I'm too old for naps.

19:47.875 --> 19:50.500
Now, Rabby,
you be a good boy,

19:50.500 --> 19:53.000
or no carrot cake
for snackie time.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.416
Rabby? Snackie time?

19:55.416 --> 19:58.500
Okay, kid. You guys
go ahead and nap.

19:58.500 --> 20:01.875
We can't go to sleep
without a glass of milk.

20:01.875 --> 20:04.250
Not cold milk.

20:04.250 --> 20:06.166
Come on.

20:06.166 --> 20:08.208
Aw, no, Stan.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.500
I don't know how
to warm up a cow.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.875
Not that warm.

20:12.875 --> 20:15.416
Besides, we're not
thirsty anymore.

20:15.416 --> 20:17.458
So let's get on
with the nap time story.

20:17.458 --> 20:19.708
A story? Uh...

20:19.708 --> 20:22.083
Once upon a time--

20:22.083 --> 20:23.625
I've heard that one.

20:23.625 --> 20:27.208
Well, uh, there was
this dragon and--

20:27.208 --> 20:30.125
Oh, d-d-dear. Dragons.

20:30.125 --> 20:32.875
No dragons.
We'll get nightmares.

20:32.875 --> 20:34.500
You know, Rabbit,

20:34.500 --> 20:38.416
she reminds me of
someone very familiar.

20:38.416 --> 20:40.875
Yes, I-- I noticed.

20:40.875 --> 20:44.250
She's behaving more
like me than I am.

20:44.250 --> 20:47.375
So you better behave
yourself, long ears. Hoo!

20:47.375 --> 20:49.250
Too late. We missed
our nap time.

20:49.250 --> 20:50.750
Now we want some honey.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.708
Yes, please.

20:52.708 --> 20:54.875
Uh, honey, Uh, yeah.

20:54.875 --> 20:57.375
Yeah. Uh, we got honey.

20:57.375 --> 21:00.583
Cassie: Not that one.
It's too small.

21:00.583 --> 21:02.458
That's too big.

21:02.458 --> 21:04.416
We want that one.

21:04.416 --> 21:08.708
Duh, I don't know if I
ought to take that one.

21:08.708 --> 21:11.291
Just get them what they
want, Hef, quick,

21:11.291 --> 21:12.708
or we'll never shut them up.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.583
Now what did we do
to deserve this?

21:23.583 --> 21:25.291
Do you think
we ought to help them?

21:25.291 --> 21:26.708
You want to help?

21:26.708 --> 21:29.333
Just keep that bird
away from us.

21:29.333 --> 21:33.000
Cassie, that was a very,
very dangerous thing to do,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.833
and all I have to say is...

21:35.833 --> 21:39.500
thank you for saving us.

21:39.500 --> 21:42.708
I can see now you are
indeed grown up

21:42.708 --> 21:45.125
and quite able
to take care of yourself.

21:45.125 --> 21:46.500
Thank you, Rabbit.

21:46.500 --> 21:49.875
And if I can't be
your Rabby anymore,

21:49.875 --> 21:53.833
I can still be
your friend Rabbit.

21:53.833 --> 21:56.291
My very best friend
Rabbit.

21:59.125 --> 22:01.000
Aren't you coming, Pooh?

22:01.000 --> 22:04.333
Oh, I thought, Piglet,
I might stay behind

22:04.333 --> 22:06.875
and, uh, clean up a bit.
