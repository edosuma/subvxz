[Clang]

00:28.012 --> 00:29.512
[Clattering]

00:44.834 --> 00:47.664
Oh, my God. It's Lance Delorca.

00:47.698 --> 00:48.864
Castle: Really?

00:48.899 --> 00:50.500
This was in fashion in the '90s?

00:50.534 --> 00:53.503
Yeah, I used to rock that in
school with my Doc Martens.

00:53.537 --> 00:56.438
You do realize we have a full
range of all-clad at home.

00:56.472 --> 00:57.439
Except this one's my favorite.

00:57.473 --> 00:59.108
My nona used to make
me scrambled eggs in it

00:59.142 --> 01:00.409
- when I was little.
- Gotcha.

01:00.443 --> 01:02.577
Okay, so, I'm gonna leave the
rest of this kitchen stuff here

01:02.612 --> 01:05.310
for when my cousin Sofia moves in.

01:05.330 --> 01:08.156
You know,
I don't think I'm gonna miss this place.

01:08.745 --> 01:11.053
- What do you mean?
- Well, the floors creak,

01:11.087 --> 01:13.755
and we can hear everything
Mr. Kubiak does in his bathroom.

01:13.790 --> 01:16.558
You never said anything about it before.

01:16.592 --> 01:19.060
It doesn't matter now. You're moving out.

01:19.094 --> 01:21.763
[Cellphone rings]

01:21.798 --> 01:22.931
[Beep]

01:22.965 --> 01:23.998
Beckett.

01:27.078 --> 01:29.370
Thanks.

01:29.404 --> 01:30.972
You okay?

01:31.006 --> 01:32.040
Yeah, sure. I'm fine.

01:32.074 --> 01:34.709
Esposito:
Which can't be said for our dead guy.

01:34.743 --> 01:37.078
Usher was closing up
last night around 11:30,

01:37.112 --> 01:38.913
saw someone fleeing the scene.

01:38.948 --> 01:40.414
That's when he found the body.

01:40.449 --> 01:41.916
Did he say what that someone looked like?

01:41.951 --> 01:42.984
Just a figure in a dark coat.

01:43.018 --> 01:46.954
As far as our vic goes,
there's no wallet, no I.D., no cell.

01:46.988 --> 01:48.055
But the Usher thinks that he might be...

01:48.089 --> 01:49.223
Lance Delorca.

01:49.257 --> 01:51.058
Who's Lance Delorca?

01:51.092 --> 01:53.094
He's that guy!

01:53.114 --> 01:54.829
He's one of the biggest
action heroes of the 1980s

01:54.863 --> 01:57.231
and a huge role model from my youth.

01:57.265 --> 01:59.834
Okay, well, he does look a little familiar.

01:59.868 --> 02:02.302
"A little"? He's the star of
all the "Hard Kill" movies.

02:02.337 --> 02:04.504
Ex-Navy seal, zen master Rico Cruz

02:04.538 --> 02:06.740
with the catchphrase
"time to hit Cruz control"?

02:06.774 --> 02:08.407
Yeah, I was never a fan.

02:08.442 --> 02:10.077
Me, neither. What's he done lately, anyway?

02:10.110 --> 02:12.259
- Yeah, right?
- Beat leukemia.

02:13.714 --> 02:15.415
Yeah, he hadn't acted in years.

02:15.449 --> 02:17.150
Suffered a couple setbacks

02:17.185 --> 02:18.818
due to drugs, alcohol,
and some box-office flops.

02:18.853 --> 02:20.754
But... but Lance lived in L.A.

02:20.788 --> 02:22.955
I wonder what he was doing in town.

02:22.990 --> 02:23.990
And at this theater.

02:24.024 --> 02:25.792
Did he come here to watch
one of his own movies?

02:25.826 --> 02:27.159
The usher said no.

02:27.194 --> 02:29.095
And there was no ticket
stub found on the body.

02:29.129 --> 02:32.098
There is perimortem bruising
on his hands and torso.

02:32.132 --> 02:34.300
Castle's idol must have gotten into a fight

02:34.334 --> 02:36.002
not too long before he died.

02:36.036 --> 02:39.438
Cause of death is clearly
strangulation by ligature.

02:39.472 --> 02:41.707
A narrow ligature, from the looks of it.

02:41.741 --> 02:44.810
Ryan: Made by a thin wire
tied to two wooden dowels?

02:44.844 --> 02:45.677
C.S.U. found this in the dumpster.

02:45.712 --> 02:47.846
A garrote. Who would use one of those?

02:47.881 --> 02:50.349
Special forces will sometimes
when you want to kill quietly.

02:50.384 --> 02:52.350
Well, the bigger question is
how'd they get the drop on Lance Delorca?

02:52.385 --> 02:54.152
Ryan: Uh,
Lance played an action hero, Castle.

02:54.186 --> 02:55.788
It doesn't mean he was one.

02:55.822 --> 02:58.023
Au contraire, mon frere.

02:58.057 --> 03:00.191
Lance was born in Spain, where,
before he became an actor,

03:00.226 --> 03:04.696
he was a member of the CNI,
the Spanish intelligence agency.

03:04.731 --> 03:08.066
He was black ops.
This man was a lethal weapon.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.235
Yeah, well, not lethal enough.

03:10.269 --> 03:12.404
Have C.S.U. take a look at
the murder weapon for prints.

03:12.438 --> 03:13.905
I'll get ahold of his next of kin.

03:13.940 --> 03:15.140
We'll see if they know who
might have done this to him.

03:15.174 --> 03:16.908
[Camera shutter clicks]

03:16.943 --> 03:18.910
Cruz: Every man has his price, El Jafe.

03:18.945 --> 03:21.479
Name yours, and we can end this.

03:21.513 --> 03:22.880
There he is...

03:22.915 --> 03:25.883
Lance Delorca as Rico Cruz
squaring off with El Jafe,

03:25.918 --> 03:27.718
the ruthless drug lord,
played by Henry Boothe.

03:27.753 --> 03:30.321
See, in this scene,
El Jafe has just abducted

03:30.355 --> 03:32.056
a brilliant but buxom archaeologist

03:32.090 --> 03:33.691
from a dig in Cartagena.

03:33.725 --> 03:35.893
Now Rico is trying to pay him ransom

03:35.928 --> 03:37.094
to get her released.

03:37.128 --> 03:39.263
El Jafe: Dangerous game, senor.
"I got your zero."

03:39.297 --> 03:41.332
I got your zero, Rico.

03:41.366 --> 03:43.233
- "You need backup, just say the word."
- You need backup, just say the word.

03:43.268 --> 03:45.669
And I'll take 'em all out. [Laughs]

03:45.703 --> 03:47.271
I was raised by a single mother.

03:47.305 --> 03:49.673
"Hard Kill" was how I got my bro time.

03:49.707 --> 03:51.908
- That explains so much.
- Mm-hmm.

03:51.943 --> 03:54.744
That's Rico's partner in all the
"Hard Kill" movies,

03:54.779 --> 03:57.246
Booker Dane, played by Brock Harmon.

03:57.281 --> 03:59.082
Yeah,
the guy from "The Indestructibles" movies,

03:59.116 --> 04:00.784
where all the badass action heroes

04:00.818 --> 04:03.186
- band together for one last mission.
- Before they die of old age.

04:03.220 --> 04:06.055
Hey. It's a great film.
And so is the sequel.

04:06.090 --> 04:08.758
El Jafe's henchwoman,
played by Brock's wife,

04:08.793 --> 04:10.961
Naomi Duvray, the one in the black.

04:10.995 --> 04:13.096
- Get your hands off me.
- Shut up!

04:13.130 --> 04:14.430
El Jafe: There she is, Mr. Cruz.

04:14.465 --> 04:17.233
- Your precious archaeologist.
- The redhead?

04:17.267 --> 04:19.135
She's an archaeologist?
That strains credibility.

04:19.168 --> 04:21.769
Yeah, in a good way.

04:21.805 --> 04:23.239
Hard at work investigating, I see.
[Video pauses]

04:26.010 --> 04:27.643
Uh, actually, I just called TSA,

04:27.677 --> 04:28.777
and Lance flew into town two weeks ago.

04:28.812 --> 04:30.779
We're still trying to run
down where he was staying.

04:30.814 --> 04:32.314
Esposito: And I had C.S.U.
take a look at that garrote.

04:32.348 --> 04:33.382
There's no prints or DNA,

04:33.416 --> 04:35.317
but it's made out of a
high-strength monofilament.

04:35.351 --> 04:37.953
And I... found the next of kin.

04:39.188 --> 04:41.289
- The archaeologist?
- Yeah. Lance married the actress.

04:41.324 --> 04:42.391
Her name's Kat Kingsley.

04:42.425 --> 04:43.325
I know what her name is.

04:43.359 --> 04:45.260
While you were having
your b-movie festival,

04:45.294 --> 04:47.262
I tracked her down.

04:47.296 --> 04:48.596
She's in New York, she's shooting a film,

04:48.631 --> 04:49.597
and she's on her way in now.

04:49.632 --> 04:51.433
She's coming here?!

04:51.467 --> 04:54.436
I had her poster on my wall for like...

04:55.704 --> 04:58.206
for about a minute. Hmm.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.970
You know,
maybe you should sit this one out, Castle.

05:09.272 --> 05:12.420
This doesn't seem real, like it's just a...

05:12.454 --> 05:13.880
a bad dream.

05:13.900 --> 05:15.390
Ms. Kingsley, do you know of anyone

05:15.424 --> 05:16.891
that would have wanted
to harm your husband?

05:16.925 --> 05:18.726
No. Of course not.

05:18.761 --> 05:20.795
And when was the last
time you talked to him?

05:20.829 --> 05:22.130
It was a week ago.

05:22.164 --> 05:24.980
We tried to meet for lunch,
but it never worked out.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.237
A week ago?
The two of you weren't staying together?

05:27.257 --> 05:28.803
We were getting a divorce.

05:28.837 --> 05:30.104
I saw Lance through his cancer treatment,

05:30.139 --> 05:34.742
but after all the years,
the high, the lows,

05:34.777 --> 05:37.537
neither of us had anything left.
I mean, it was all amicable.

05:37.557 --> 05:39.121
Do you know what he was doing in town?

05:39.141 --> 05:42.749
He was shooting a film
with his old partner, Brock Harmon.

05:42.784 --> 05:45.786
- What film?
- The next "Indestructibles" movie.

05:45.820 --> 05:47.054
Brock's directing.

05:47.088 --> 05:49.590
In fact, Lance was staying with him.

05:49.624 --> 05:52.159
So if there was trouble,
Brock would know about it.

05:52.193 --> 05:53.927
Man: Go, go, go!

05:53.961 --> 05:56.797
[Indistinct shouting]

06:02.536 --> 06:04.104
[Scoffs] This is so cheesy.

06:04.138 --> 06:05.739
Ah, shh!

06:05.773 --> 06:08.608
And by "cheesy," she means "amazing."

06:11.011 --> 06:12.579
Come on. Behold the miracle of cinema.

06:12.613 --> 06:14.447
The real miracle is how a girl like that

06:14.481 --> 06:15.781
is hanging out with a bunch of guys

06:15.816 --> 06:17.350
who are old enough to be her grandfather.

06:17.384 --> 06:19.919
That's Serafina,
the mixed martial arts star.

06:19.953 --> 06:22.121
She could beat all those guys to a pulp.

06:22.155 --> 06:23.489
Who's that guy?

06:23.524 --> 06:26.092
Didn't you make me watch
a movie with him in it?

06:26.126 --> 06:27.659
Rolf Magnus.

06:27.694 --> 06:30.930
He's a nordic bodybuilder,
card-carrying member of Mensa.

06:30.964 --> 06:32.932
I don't know, Castle. Maybe I just
like the old-school guys, you know?

06:32.966 --> 06:35.968
Like Eastwood, Bronson, McQueen...

06:36.002 --> 06:38.704
- real actors.
- Well, then check out Clay Biggs.

06:38.739 --> 06:41.006
Graduated top of his class at Juilliard,

06:41.041 --> 06:42.307
in contrast to Brock Harmon,

06:42.342 --> 06:44.476
who made his on-screen debut

06:44.510 --> 06:46.845
- as a porn star known as "Brock the... "
- Cut! That's a cut!

06:46.879 --> 06:47.979
[Bell rings]

06:48.013 --> 06:52.484
Steve, get me something
that works or get a new job.

06:52.518 --> 06:54.453
[Indistinct conversations]

06:56.996 --> 06:58.994
Thank you. [Sighs]

07:00.025 --> 07:01.025
Beckett: Mr. Harmon.

07:01.060 --> 07:03.895
- Detective Beckett. This is Mr. Castle.
- Hi.

07:03.929 --> 07:04.863
Mr. Harmon... huge fan, huge fan.

07:04.897 --> 07:05.764
[Stammering]

07:05.798 --> 07:08.066
I'm... it's a hon... honor to meet you.

07:08.100 --> 07:09.200
The honor is mine.

07:09.235 --> 07:12.291
I've passed many an hour in
the John reading your books.

07:13.205 --> 07:14.872
We're here about Lance Delorca.

07:14.906 --> 07:18.045
Ah. Sad day for me. And my family.

07:18.065 --> 07:20.043
- Here you go, darling.
- Oh, thanks, babe.

07:20.078 --> 07:21.044
Well, if you're a fan of mine,

07:21.079 --> 07:23.414
you know my wife, Naomi Duvray.

07:23.448 --> 07:25.249
[Laughs] And her jewelry line, too, I hope.

07:25.284 --> 07:28.085
She just launched a spring collection...
nice.

07:28.119 --> 07:30.254
You were just outstanding
as El Jafe's henchwoman

07:30.289 --> 07:32.055
in "Hard Kill." That was... ooh.

07:32.090 --> 07:34.858
Oh, that is so sweet. [Laughs]

07:34.893 --> 07:37.027
I had a mean roundhouse kick,
but I wasn't much of an actor.

07:37.061 --> 07:38.929
Well, it never stopped me.

07:38.963 --> 07:39.930
[Laughter]

07:39.964 --> 07:41.431
Oh, uh, this is my son, Trey.

07:41.465 --> 07:43.200
Good to meet you.

07:43.234 --> 07:45.402
Uh, Mr. Harmon, could we speak privately?

07:45.436 --> 07:47.437
Oh. Sure.

07:47.471 --> 07:49.038
[Knife clicks] [Grunts]

07:49.072 --> 07:51.675
Transplant from a bone-marrow donor,

07:51.709 --> 07:53.876
that's what put Lance in remission,
saved his life.

07:53.911 --> 07:56.012
He knew he'd been given a second chance.

07:56.046 --> 07:58.415
He got sober, cleaned up his act.

07:58.449 --> 08:00.016
That's why I gave him a part in the movie.

08:00.050 --> 08:02.485
This could have been his big comeback.

08:02.520 --> 08:05.888
So, we understand
that he was staying with you.

08:05.923 --> 08:07.023
How did he seem?

08:07.057 --> 08:09.758
Quiet. Secretive, I'd even say.

08:09.793 --> 08:12.361
Lance was always a man of few words,

08:12.395 --> 08:14.997
but even fewer this time out.

08:15.032 --> 08:16.565
Any idea what he was doing
on the lower east side

08:16.599 --> 08:18.567
last night at 11:30?

08:18.601 --> 08:19.902
I didn't even know he was in town.

08:19.937 --> 08:21.570
You said he was staying with you.

08:21.604 --> 08:24.005
Right. Lance wrapped last week.

08:24.040 --> 08:26.107
I was told transportation took him

08:26.142 --> 08:27.376
straight from the set to the airport.

08:27.410 --> 08:29.511
Okay, well, my detectives will
need to speak with the driver,

08:29.546 --> 08:31.413
along with anyone else that Lance knew.

08:31.448 --> 08:33.346
Of course. Um...

08:33.366 --> 08:36.505
What exactly happened? How did he die?

08:37.174 --> 08:39.484
Um, he was strangled...

08:40.155 --> 08:42.590
with a garrote.

08:43.808 --> 08:45.745
Does that mean something to you?

08:45.765 --> 08:47.929
You know Lance was CNI, right?

08:47.964 --> 08:49.965
Spanish intelligence.

08:49.999 --> 08:51.799
What does that have to do with his murder?

08:51.834 --> 08:53.768
Everything.

08:53.802 --> 08:56.537
He was a CNI assassin.
That was his signature.

08:56.572 --> 08:58.138
He killed people with a garrote.

08:58.173 --> 08:59.640
[Elevator bell dings]

08:59.675 --> 09:01.709
Which is why it was used to kill him.

09:01.744 --> 09:04.645
Lance was murdered because
he's the spanish Jason Bourne.

09:04.680 --> 09:05.780
Why, Castle?

09:05.814 --> 09:08.082
Because a "b"
action-movie star in a kimono said so?

09:08.116 --> 09:09.450
Because it makes sense.

09:09.485 --> 09:11.252
Lance was drawing on his experience

09:11.286 --> 09:14.222
as a ruthless CNI operative
to play action heroes.

09:14.242 --> 09:16.090
But his shadowy past caught up with him.

09:16.124 --> 09:19.593
Maybe it was revenge
for a-a hit he did back in the day...

09:19.627 --> 09:22.162
kill him the way he killed.

09:22.197 --> 09:24.164
Castle, he left CNI 30 years ago.

09:24.199 --> 09:26.571
Why would his past catch up to him now?

09:26.591 --> 09:30.069
Mr. Castle might just be right about CNI.

09:30.104 --> 09:32.071
Aha. How... how am I right.

09:32.106 --> 09:35.008
Esposito and Ryan are off
interviewing folks on the set.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.010
But before they left,
they got onto something.

09:37.044 --> 09:39.946
They pulled Lance's phone records,
and the day he died,

09:39.980 --> 09:42.749
he made a phone call to Interpol in Spain,

09:42.784 --> 09:45.518
to the office of one Enrique Gomez.

09:45.552 --> 09:47.287
What does Gomez have to do with CNI?

09:47.321 --> 09:49.977
According to his bio,
Gomez used to work there

09:49.997 --> 09:52.458
at the same time Lance Delorca did.

09:52.492 --> 09:55.461
So Lance reaches out to another ex-agent,

09:55.495 --> 09:57.432
and he's killed with a garrote?

09:57.718 --> 09:59.365
Mark my words... [Sighs]

09:59.400 --> 10:01.967
This case is gonna lead us
into a labyrinthian world

10:02.001 --> 10:05.337
of deceit, villainy,
and international espionage.

10:05.371 --> 10:07.306
This is better than one of his movies.

10:07.340 --> 10:10.085
After what I saw, it'd have to be.

10:12.344 --> 10:14.664
S07E09
Last Action Hero

10:14.684 --> 10:17.419
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

10:19.317 --> 10:20.266
Yeah. Thanks.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.085
[Receiver clicks]
Update.

10:22.119 --> 10:26.223
I contacted Interpol to track down
that guy Lance called, Enrique Gomez.

10:26.243 --> 10:28.431
Well,
it turns out Gomez is here in New York

10:28.451 --> 10:29.773
for a meeting at the U.N.

10:29.793 --> 10:31.652
Where was he last night at 11:30?

10:31.672 --> 10:33.262
On a red-eye in from Madrid.

10:33.296 --> 10:34.830
He arrived early this morning,

10:34.865 --> 10:35.931
so he's not our killer.

10:35.966 --> 10:38.385
But Interpol will send him
over here for an interview.

10:38.405 --> 10:39.937
He might have insight on the murder.

10:39.957 --> 10:42.838
Well, I talked to CNI
to ask them about Lance's time there,

10:42.873 --> 10:44.140
about missions that he was involved in,

10:44.174 --> 10:47.008
enemies that he might have had,
and they are stone-walling me.

10:47.042 --> 10:48.943
Intelligence agencies like CNI

10:48.978 --> 10:51.513
avoid disclosing information
on their employees.

10:51.547 --> 10:54.015
But I do have contacts
in the state department.

10:54.049 --> 10:55.784
- Let me just ask around.
- Great.

10:55.818 --> 10:59.053
I've reached out to my guys in Washington,
as well.

10:59.088 --> 11:01.723
Hey, Beckett. I think we got
something from that movie set.

11:01.758 --> 11:04.192
We talked to the driver who
took Lance to the airport.

11:04.226 --> 11:05.794
Only, that's not what he did.

11:05.828 --> 11:07.295
Lance asked the driver to drop him off

11:07.329 --> 11:09.264
at some seedy hotel on Broome Street.

11:09.298 --> 11:11.199
And he didn't want
anybody to know about it.

11:11.233 --> 11:12.633
He paid the driver 100 bucks to lie

11:12.668 --> 11:14.135
and say he dropped Lance off at JFK.

11:14.170 --> 11:15.937
Why would he go to this hotel?

11:15.971 --> 11:17.571
Well, that's where it gets weird.

11:17.606 --> 11:19.140
The unis we sent to canvass

11:19.175 --> 11:21.309
said that Lance had rented a
room there for the past week.

11:21.343 --> 11:24.144
Under the name Rico Cruz,
his character from "Hard Kill."

11:24.179 --> 11:25.179
Um... Okay.

11:25.213 --> 11:26.814
Have unis check for
security video at the hotel,

11:26.848 --> 11:28.949
and, uh, let's round up

11:28.983 --> 11:30.318
any of Lance's personal
effects from his room.

11:30.352 --> 11:31.385
Yeah.

11:32.821 --> 11:33.788
- Thanks, l.T.
- Yeah.

11:33.822 --> 11:34.922
I-I don't understand.

11:34.956 --> 11:38.038
Why would Lance leave Brock
Harmon's fifth Avenue digs

11:38.058 --> 11:39.726
to go stay in a flophouse?

11:39.760 --> 11:41.161
And without telling anyone.

11:41.196 --> 11:42.595
He's definitely up to something.

11:42.630 --> 11:43.931
Yeah.

11:43.965 --> 11:46.099
Hey! A "Hard Kill" DVD.

11:46.134 --> 11:48.302
Looks like Lance was trying
to relive the old days.

11:48.336 --> 11:51.071
"Time to hit Cruz control."

11:51.105 --> 11:52.005
You know, maybe that's what I need...

11:52.040 --> 11:53.440
a catchphrase.

11:53.474 --> 11:55.453
"Time to meet out justice."

11:56.024 --> 11:58.345
"Time... For prison time."

11:58.379 --> 12:00.146
Yeah, you keep working on that, bro.

12:00.180 --> 12:02.649
"Time to pay the bill for doing the kill."

12:02.683 --> 12:04.116
Okay, on second thought, don't.

12:05.018 --> 12:07.454
Hey. Building schematics?

12:07.488 --> 12:09.789
There's a bunch of weird stuff in this box.

12:09.809 --> 12:13.693
Soldering iron, blue craft paint,

12:13.713 --> 12:17.196
a microphone, a USB drive...
both empty cases.

12:17.231 --> 12:19.031
Looks like he was building something,

12:19.066 --> 12:20.333
like a recording device.

12:20.367 --> 12:23.169
And then he added stickers to it?

12:23.203 --> 12:24.170
Stickers? What the hell is that about?

12:24.204 --> 12:26.271
I don't know,
but the "2" and "5" are missing.

12:26.305 --> 12:28.607
Hmm.

12:29.732 --> 12:31.309
"Trey."

12:31.344 --> 12:32.978
Hey, this must be Trey Harmon,
Brock Harmon's kid.

12:33.012 --> 12:35.213
Why would Lance call him?

12:35.248 --> 12:38.016
He wanted to ask me about
the New York club scene.

12:38.050 --> 12:39.985
That's my thing. I'm a club promoter.

12:40.019 --> 12:41.553
But I kind of shut him down, to be honest.

12:41.588 --> 12:42.320
Why is that?

12:42.355 --> 12:45.156
After the cancer, he got sober.

12:45.191 --> 12:46.892
No way I was gonna help
him fall off the wagon

12:46.926 --> 12:49.294
- and start partying again.
- Huh.

12:49.328 --> 12:51.296
Do you recognize this?

12:51.330 --> 12:53.331
I think it might be the
floor plan to a club.

12:53.366 --> 12:55.166
[Groaning]

12:55.201 --> 12:56.701
Brock: I barely touched you.

12:56.735 --> 12:58.236
I don't know.
I can't really tell what that is.

12:58.271 --> 12:59.236
Did Lance have this?

12:59.271 --> 13:03.073
Yeah,
and we don't think that he wanted to party.

13:03.108 --> 13:05.710
Did he explain to you why
he was interested in clubs?

13:05.744 --> 13:06.544
Not really.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.012
He just said that there was something

13:08.046 --> 13:09.729
that he needed to take care of.

13:09.749 --> 13:12.650
There was something he
needed to take care of.

13:12.684 --> 13:14.251
I have a theory.

13:14.286 --> 13:16.220
Great, 'cause, right now, I could use one.

13:16.254 --> 13:18.822
It's a classic action-movie plot device.

13:18.856 --> 13:20.391
Lance, his black-op days long behind him,

13:20.425 --> 13:23.260
decides to go on one final mission

13:23.295 --> 13:25.562
to vanquish his old nemesis.

13:25.596 --> 13:26.663
Which would be?

13:26.697 --> 13:29.499
Uh, it's a rival assassin
who was once his best friend

13:29.534 --> 13:31.235
but then betrayed him.

13:31.269 --> 13:33.036
Or, actually, uh,
a blofeldstyle supervillain

13:33.070 --> 13:34.604
who killed Lance's wife
and then disappeared.

13:34.639 --> 13:37.273
Yeah, but Kat Kingsley is still alive.

13:37.308 --> 13:38.842
No, Lance's other wife

13:38.876 --> 13:40.577
from his tragic but secret CNI past.

13:40.611 --> 13:42.178
Now,
I admit I'm a little sketchy on the details

13:42.212 --> 13:43.648
of the mission and the nemesis,

13:43.668 --> 13:47.918
but bottom line is Lance
embarked on a mission.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.498
The years had caught up with him.
He had lost a step.

13:50.518 --> 13:52.788
So he was dispatched by another operative

13:52.823 --> 13:55.224
who was younger, quicker... And deadlier.

13:55.259 --> 13:56.792
And... Possibly female.

13:56.827 --> 13:59.028
Tory screened that security-cam video

13:59.063 --> 14:01.264
from the hotel and found this.

14:01.298 --> 14:03.299
That's Lance leaving
through the hotel lobby

14:03.334 --> 14:05.133
on his last day on earth.

14:05.168 --> 14:08.604
And 10 seconds later,
this woman goes after him.

14:08.638 --> 14:10.174
That's her. That's the operative.

14:10.194 --> 14:11.663
She's wearing a dark coat,

14:11.683 --> 14:13.219
just like the person who
left the crime scene.

14:13.239 --> 14:15.143
She must have trailed Lance from the hotel,

14:15.178 --> 14:17.145
then moved in for the kill.

14:17.180 --> 14:19.147
She's blond,
but she might be wearing a wig.

14:19.182 --> 14:20.916
Take a look at her sunglasses

14:20.951 --> 14:23.218
and the way that she's angled
her face away from the camera.

14:23.252 --> 14:24.319
She didn't want to be I.D.'d.

14:24.354 --> 14:25.587
She may have gotten her wish.
[Cellphone chimes]

14:25.621 --> 14:27.589
Tory said there's not enough
here to run facial recognition.

14:27.623 --> 14:28.756
You know, she's wearing an earring.

14:28.791 --> 14:31.759
See if Tory can do something with that.

14:31.794 --> 14:33.428
Enrique Gomez is on his way up.

14:33.463 --> 14:35.330
Maybe he knows who she is.

14:35.365 --> 14:37.332
Gomez: Nope. I don't recognize her.

14:38.179 --> 14:40.502
I'm sad to learn of Lance's death.

14:40.536 --> 14:42.937
What was your relationship with him,
Mr. Gomez?

14:42.972 --> 14:46.153
We were close as young men.
Less so recently.

14:46.173 --> 14:49.310
Yet, he called you just before he died?
Why?

14:49.344 --> 14:52.079
He needed a bodyguard,
somebody he could trust.

14:52.114 --> 14:53.747
And I know such people.

14:53.767 --> 14:56.117
But none of them were
available on such short notice,

14:56.151 --> 14:57.418
so I couldn't help him.

14:57.452 --> 14:59.586
Why would Lance need a bodyguard?

14:59.621 --> 15:01.155
He didn't tell me. I didn't ask.

15:01.593 --> 15:04.291
You think maybe he was
going on one last mission?

15:04.326 --> 15:07.094
Or perhaps his CNI past was
coming back to haunt him.

15:07.129 --> 15:09.096
Well, that would be rather unlikely.

15:09.131 --> 15:12.665
You see, Lance didn't have a CNI past.

15:14.018 --> 15:16.169
Why is everyone saying that he did?

15:16.203 --> 15:19.139
Well, we grew up together,
but I was the one who went into CNI.

15:19.173 --> 15:20.507
And when Lance came to America,

15:20.542 --> 15:22.442
he asked me to use my backstory

15:22.476 --> 15:24.878
to make himself more
mysterious and interesting.

15:24.913 --> 15:27.680
[Stammers] Uh, I'm s...
I'm so... I'm sorry.

15:27.714 --> 15:29.315
Are you... are you saying Lance Delorca

15:29.350 --> 15:31.484
wasn't a CNI operative?

15:31.519 --> 15:33.119
Before he started acting,

15:33.154 --> 15:36.475
he was a goat herder in the Pyrenees.

15:42.829 --> 15:45.297
Hey.

15:45.331 --> 15:47.332
So, Enrique Gomez's story checks out.

15:47.367 --> 15:48.434
And, with his authorization,

15:48.468 --> 15:53.072
CNI confirms that Lance Delorca was...
Never an agent.

15:53.106 --> 15:56.475
My hero was a liar... and a goat herder.

15:56.509 --> 15:59.311
Yes, well,
despite this deeply personal betrayal,

15:59.345 --> 16:01.146
we still have a murder to solve.

16:01.181 --> 16:03.382
- How? We're back to square one.
- Not necessarily.

16:03.416 --> 16:04.683
I mean, there's still that mystery woman

16:04.717 --> 16:05.850
that followed Lance from the S.R.O.

16:05.885 --> 16:09.254
She may not be a mystery anymore.

16:09.289 --> 16:10.589
She a goat herder?

16:10.623 --> 16:12.424
Oh, my God.

16:12.459 --> 16:14.159
I didn't get anywhere with the earrings.

16:14.194 --> 16:17.161
They're too common,
but that got me focused on her ear.

16:17.196 --> 16:19.330
Okay. What about it? It looks normal.

16:19.364 --> 16:21.165
It is, but ear biometrics...

16:21.200 --> 16:22.867
size, shape, configuration...

16:22.902 --> 16:25.036
are almost as unique as fingerprints.

16:25.071 --> 16:27.171
An entire field of study
is devoted to the subject.

16:27.206 --> 16:29.074
- Earology.
- Earology.

16:29.108 --> 16:30.174
How did you know that?

16:30.209 --> 16:32.577
FBI seminar.

16:32.612 --> 16:34.245
So,
you used her ear to identify this woman?

16:34.279 --> 16:36.046
Yes, by isolating the ear

16:36.081 --> 16:38.416
and running it against
the mug-shot database.

16:38.450 --> 16:41.219
When nothing popped,
I ran it against photos of women

16:41.253 --> 16:43.588
who had any connection with Lance Delorca.

16:43.622 --> 16:45.289
The computer analyzed thousands of images

16:45.324 --> 16:46.857
and finally found a match

16:46.891 --> 16:50.140
with a 99.2% probability
that it's this woman.

16:51.145 --> 16:53.030
That's Kat Kingsley.

16:53.064 --> 16:55.565
Lance was killed by his soon-to-be ex-wife?

17:05.279 --> 17:07.647
Hey. So, we heard Kat Kingsley was here.
Whoa!

17:07.667 --> 17:10.428
And that is a sexy outfit
for an interrogation.

17:10.448 --> 17:11.584
It's her costume.

17:11.618 --> 17:14.087
They took her right from
the set of her movie.

17:14.122 --> 17:15.989
Ryan: Man, she is really...

17:16.023 --> 17:17.991
- Hot?
- ...holding up well.

17:18.026 --> 17:19.792
- What's the movie?
- It's direct-to-video.

17:19.828 --> 17:21.428
She plays a female Indiana Jones.

17:21.462 --> 17:23.363
She's an archaeologist again?

17:23.396 --> 17:24.864
So, do you think it would be weird

17:24.897 --> 17:26.132
if I asked her to sign this?

17:26.165 --> 17:28.468
When? On her way to jail?

17:28.502 --> 17:30.470
It would mean so much to me.

17:30.504 --> 17:32.305
What would her motivation
be for killing Lance?

17:32.340 --> 17:34.207
Well,
it seems her divorce was a tad messier

17:34.241 --> 17:35.842
than she led us to believe.

17:35.876 --> 17:39.611
So, what role are you playing now,
Ms. Kingsley?

17:39.646 --> 17:41.013
Not the grieving widow.

17:41.048 --> 17:43.816
I need to get back to set,

17:43.851 --> 17:45.218
or they're gonna shut down production

17:45.252 --> 17:47.220
on "Raiders of the nubian temple."

17:47.254 --> 17:50.122
Yeah, well,
you've got bigger problems than that.

17:50.157 --> 17:52.058
So, I talked to Lance's lawyer,

17:52.092 --> 17:55.527
and he said that your divorce
was anything but amicable.

17:55.562 --> 17:58.530
We're actors. We're passionate people.

17:58.565 --> 18:00.298
Things got stormy at times.

18:00.333 --> 18:01.700
Because you wanted the Malibu house,

18:01.735 --> 18:03.201
and he didn't want to give it to you.

18:03.236 --> 18:05.337
That home has sentimental value to me.

18:05.372 --> 18:06.538
Along with monetary value.

18:06.573 --> 18:08.340
I mean, after 20 years, it's worth...

18:08.375 --> 18:09.140
$8 million.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.142
And with Lance out of the picture,

18:11.177 --> 18:12.577
it was all yours.

18:12.611 --> 18:15.380
You think I killed my husband?

18:15.414 --> 18:17.249
You tried to before.

18:17.283 --> 18:18.116
Remember the incident

18:18.150 --> 18:20.919
where you discharged a firearm... at him?

18:20.953 --> 18:23.221
I was cleaning it.

18:23.256 --> 18:26.391
I know bad acting when I see it.

18:26.425 --> 18:28.426
Beckett: This is you, Ms. Kingsley,

18:28.460 --> 18:33.063
following Lance hours before he was killed.

18:33.098 --> 18:34.849
I was not following him.

18:35.701 --> 18:37.602
He asked me to meet with him.

18:37.636 --> 18:39.203
And he told you to wear a disguise?

18:39.237 --> 18:41.439
I couldn't be seen with
him after the gun thing.

18:41.473 --> 18:43.674
We were told to avoid contact.

18:43.709 --> 18:45.675
But Lance begged me.

18:45.710 --> 18:48.112
He needed cash... $200,000.

18:48.146 --> 18:50.948
He asked you for a loan?

18:50.982 --> 18:52.082
His assets were all tied
up with the divorce.

18:52.117 --> 18:54.952
I inherited some money.
He knew I had access to it.

18:54.986 --> 18:57.054
It wasn't a loan.

18:57.088 --> 18:58.956
He sold me his half of the Malibu house.

18:58.990 --> 19:00.757
Are you telling me

19:00.792 --> 19:04.861
that he traded you $4 million for $200,000?

19:04.896 --> 19:06.296
How could I pass up a deal like that?

19:06.330 --> 19:09.232
I have the promissory note to prove it.

19:09.266 --> 19:10.867
Why did he need the money?

19:10.902 --> 19:13.102
He said he needed to set something right,

19:13.137 --> 19:15.705
that he wanted to live up
to the characters he played,

19:15.740 --> 19:16.907
I think.

19:16.941 --> 19:19.642
I wasn't really listening.

19:19.676 --> 19:22.111
I just wanted him to sign over the house.

19:22.146 --> 19:22.946
I'm just being honest.

19:22.980 --> 19:24.380
Okay, fine, if you're being honest,

19:24.415 --> 19:25.581
then why don't you tell me this...

19:25.615 --> 19:26.549
we have a witness

19:26.583 --> 19:29.718
that saw a dark figure
fleeing the crime scene.

19:29.753 --> 19:31.720
Was that you?

19:31.755 --> 19:33.122
Yes.

19:34.158 --> 19:35.758
Do you want to elaborate on that?

19:35.792 --> 19:36.759
[Sighs]

19:36.793 --> 19:40.596
Lance called me that
night from a pay phone.

19:40.630 --> 19:42.297
I think he said he was in trouble

19:42.332 --> 19:43.666
and that people were after him.

19:43.700 --> 19:44.667
What people?

19:44.701 --> 19:46.101
He didn't say.

19:46.135 --> 19:47.470
But he asked me to pick him up

19:47.504 --> 19:49.338
at this theater playing "Hard Kill,"

19:49.372 --> 19:50.739
that it would be easy to find.

19:50.774 --> 19:52.941
H-he sounded so desperate.

19:52.976 --> 19:54.376
But when I got there...

19:56.312 --> 19:58.313
[Voice breaking] he was dead.

19:59.215 --> 20:01.350
Why didn't you tell us this before?

20:01.384 --> 20:03.785
I panicked. [Breathes deeply]

20:03.819 --> 20:05.587
I'm trying to restart my career.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.522
I just knew how it might look.

20:07.556 --> 20:10.324
Well, that's because it's
exactly how it does look.

20:10.359 --> 20:11.158
[Groans]

20:11.193 --> 20:12.760
Castle: Well, not to me it doesn't.

20:12.795 --> 20:14.161
[Sighs] I don't think she's our killer.

20:14.196 --> 20:16.330
Yeah, she's just an innocent archaeologist.

20:16.365 --> 20:18.533
My opinion is not affected
by her skimpy outfit.

20:18.567 --> 20:21.369
I'm speaking as an objective investigator,

20:21.403 --> 20:22.937
someone who has set their
personal feelings aside.

20:22.972 --> 20:25.506
- Along with your poster?
- Who told you?

20:25.540 --> 20:26.740
It was Ryan, wasn't it?

20:26.774 --> 20:29.310
Castle, Kat Kingsley admitted
to being at the crime scene.

20:29.344 --> 20:30.277
Yeah, when she didn't have to.

20:30.312 --> 20:31.712
Why admit to that if
you're actually guilty?

20:31.746 --> 20:33.347
To make herself look not guilty.

20:33.382 --> 20:35.349
Look, she had motive.

20:35.384 --> 20:37.151
But parts of her story still check out...

20:37.185 --> 20:38.052
the promissory note,

20:38.086 --> 20:40.388
the withdrawal from her bank for $200,000.

20:40.422 --> 20:43.390
Lance said he needed the
money to set something right.

20:43.424 --> 20:45.225
He needed to live up to
his on-screen persona.

20:45.259 --> 20:48.328
Yes, according to our murder suspect.

20:48.362 --> 20:52.365
So,
here's Lance meeting his bone-marrow donor.

20:52.400 --> 20:55.335
Perhaps surviving leukemia changed him,

20:55.369 --> 20:56.970
drove him to become a better man,

20:57.005 --> 20:59.239
a man more like the hero he portrayed.

20:59.273 --> 21:00.997
That's why,
when he registered at the hotel,

21:01.017 --> 21:05.178
he did so as Rico Cruz,
because he became Rico Cruz.

21:05.212 --> 21:06.913
What does that even mean?

21:06.947 --> 21:08.881
That, despite being an ex-goat herder

21:08.916 --> 21:10.716
with no formal black-ops training,

21:10.751 --> 21:11.817
Lance took on a mission.

21:11.852 --> 21:13.753
Oh, okay,
so we're back to "One last mission" now.

21:13.787 --> 21:15.154
Why else would he have the schematic

21:15.188 --> 21:16.321
or the listening device?

21:16.356 --> 21:18.758
Or why would he need a bodyguard?

21:18.792 --> 21:20.726
To protect himself from Kat Kingsley.

21:20.761 --> 21:23.162
Yeah,
except for her story is still holding up.

21:23.196 --> 21:24.730
That call she says was from Lance

21:24.765 --> 21:27.232
came from a pay phone six
blocks from the movie theater.

21:27.267 --> 21:28.300
All right, canvass for witnesses

21:28.334 --> 21:30.869
that saw Lance or anyone
else by that pay phone.

21:30.903 --> 21:33.905
And if he was in trouble, as Kat said,

21:33.940 --> 21:35.340
then let's find out
where he was coming from.

21:35.375 --> 21:36.375
We'll get into it,

21:36.409 --> 21:37.776
but we might not have
anything till the morning.

21:37.810 --> 21:39.078
Okay.

21:39.112 --> 21:41.246
You told her about the poster.

21:41.281 --> 21:43.482
I didn't know it was a se...
[Groans] [Sighs]

21:45.418 --> 21:46.218
I don't know.

21:46.253 --> 21:47.853
Maybe it's the way that he said it

21:47.887 --> 21:49.421
that struck a nerve.

21:49.455 --> 21:52.891
Well,
tact isn't exactly the man's middle name.

21:52.925 --> 21:55.360
Okay, but it's my place, you know?
It's not Castle's.

21:55.395 --> 21:57.996
Who cares if he never liked it?

21:58.030 --> 22:00.365
I mean, I don't know why I got so upset.

22:00.400 --> 22:04.269
Because, to him, this is just
an apartment with creaky floors.

22:04.303 --> 22:07.361
But to you,
this is where you rebuilt your life,

22:07.381 --> 22:09.273
where you solved your mother's murder,

22:09.307 --> 22:12.475
where you fell in love.

22:17.081 --> 22:19.216
Well...

22:19.250 --> 22:21.218
To the best apartment ever.

22:21.252 --> 22:24.031
To the best apartment ever.

22:26.624 --> 22:29.025
So, we struck gold on that canvass.

22:29.059 --> 22:30.393
Someone saw Lance using the pay phone?

22:30.428 --> 22:32.228
No, but they saw him before that

22:32.262 --> 22:33.362
running like hell from an alley.

22:33.397 --> 22:35.799
Which leads us to this
security-cam video right here.

22:35.833 --> 22:37.300
[Mouse clicks] You got
to see it to believe it.

22:37.334 --> 22:40.496
These four guys have got Lance cornered.

22:41.005 --> 22:42.704
Oh, this can't be good.

22:42.739 --> 22:44.240
Who are those guys?

22:44.274 --> 22:47.134
I don't know, but makes you wonder
what Lance did to have them come after him.

22:47.154 --> 22:50.446
Four thugs against a-an
aging Lance Delorca?

22:50.480 --> 22:51.914
I don't know that I can watch.

23:06.629 --> 23:08.129
Did you see that?!

23:08.664 --> 23:10.873
What Lance just did...

23:10.893 --> 23:13.268
That belongs in one of his movies.

23:13.302 --> 23:14.502
He annihilated them.

23:14.536 --> 23:15.503
Yeah, but not for long.

23:15.537 --> 23:17.339
Half an hour later,
someone annihilated him.

23:17.373 --> 23:18.993
Ah, well, right.

23:19.154 --> 23:21.242
But at least this explains the phone call.

23:21.277 --> 23:22.743
When Lance called Kat Kingsley

23:22.778 --> 23:24.743
and said,
"I'm in trouble and people are after me,"

23:24.763 --> 23:26.443
this is what he was talking about.

23:26.463 --> 23:28.583
And whoever these guys are,
they must have caught up to him.

23:28.617 --> 23:31.188
We find these guys, we'll find our killer.

23:37.406 --> 23:40.075
We can't I.D. any of these guys
off of the surveillance video.

23:40.110 --> 23:41.076
[Keyboard clacks]

23:41.111 --> 23:43.311
Tory says that the image
quality is too poor

23:43.346 --> 23:46.581
to run facial recognition,
or ear recognition.

23:46.616 --> 23:49.217
The key is finding out
what happened to Lance

23:49.252 --> 23:51.403
before he wound up in that alley...

23:51.423 --> 23:55.171
something that required
$200,000 and a listening device.

23:55.191 --> 23:56.791
But whomever he went up against

23:56.825 --> 23:58.840
sent those four sides of beef after him.

23:58.860 --> 24:00.900
And,
after seeing the ass-whupping they got,

24:00.920 --> 24:02.497
I checked nearby hospitals.

24:02.532 --> 24:04.832
Turns out that an ambulance
was called to that area

24:04.867 --> 24:06.433
during our time window.

24:06.468 --> 24:08.369
They brought in a
heavy-set dude to the E.R.

24:08.403 --> 24:10.891
He was unconscious, bruised,
and had a possible broken jaw.

24:10.911 --> 24:12.616
- All right, let's go talk to him.
- We can't.

24:12.636 --> 24:14.141
He woke up and checked
himself out of the E.R.

24:14.176 --> 24:15.309
before they could even get his name.

24:15.344 --> 24:16.644
Does the hospital have cameras?

24:16.679 --> 24:17.945
I'm glad you asked that.

24:17.980 --> 24:22.416
This guy definitely looks like
one of the guys from the video.

24:22.450 --> 24:23.936
Wait a second. I know that guy.

24:24.109 --> 24:27.102
Yeah, from the film set.
He was dressed in afghan garb.

24:27.122 --> 24:29.290
Brock Harmon barely tapped him in the face,

24:29.324 --> 24:30.824
and he screamed like a baby.

24:30.859 --> 24:33.961
Perhaps because he has a broken jaw.

24:33.996 --> 24:36.163
Man: That's not the one I said I wanted.

24:36.198 --> 24:38.298
A.D. says his name is Ernest Howe.

24:38.332 --> 24:40.100
And he's playing isis militant number 12.

24:40.134 --> 24:41.435
Not for long.

24:41.469 --> 24:43.837
You know what time it is? It's Ryan time.

24:43.872 --> 24:45.839
Please. Just stop.

24:45.874 --> 24:48.074
My name's Ryan, and I hate lyin'.

24:48.109 --> 24:50.443
Ernest Howe. NYPD.

24:50.463 --> 24:52.446
We're here to talk to
you about Lance Delorca.

24:52.480 --> 24:54.014
Yeah, it's a bummer that he died.

24:54.048 --> 24:55.782
Got a little problem with your jaw there,
Ernest?

24:55.816 --> 24:57.183
Little TMJ.

24:57.218 --> 24:58.985
You sure it's not from
that little altercation

24:59.020 --> 24:59.852
you got into the other night?

24:59.887 --> 25:01.687
Look, I don't want any more trouble.

25:01.722 --> 25:03.924
Well, you got trouble... Ryan trouble.

25:04.619 --> 25:07.027
- I don't know what that means.
- We have you on video.

25:07.061 --> 25:08.628
You and those three mooks attacked Lance,

25:08.662 --> 25:10.163
and he put the hurt on all of you.

25:10.197 --> 25:11.859
But not enough hurt,
because one of them killed him.

25:11.879 --> 25:14.099
Judging by your little trip to the E.R.,
it wasn't you.

25:14.134 --> 25:16.201
So why don't you give us the
name of your buddies, Ernest,

25:16.236 --> 25:18.604
- and whoever put them up to this.
- You got it all wrong.

25:18.639 --> 25:20.873
Those guys did this to me.

25:20.908 --> 25:23.175
I was on Lance's side.
He hired me to be his bodyguard.

25:23.209 --> 25:25.010
Why would Lance need a bodyguard?

25:25.045 --> 25:27.776
He had a meeting at Club Drift.
He wanted backup.

25:27.796 --> 25:29.630
He brought a briefcase.
I think it had money on it.

25:29.650 --> 25:31.383
Who did he meet there and
what was the money for?

25:31.418 --> 25:34.219
I don't know. They made me wait downstairs.

25:34.254 --> 25:36.021
But the meeting ended quick.

25:36.056 --> 25:39.024
All of a sudden,
four security dudes hustled us out

25:39.059 --> 25:40.993
and accused Lance of wearing a wire.

25:41.027 --> 25:43.862
A wire? Why would he be wearing a wire?

25:43.896 --> 25:45.530
Well, I didn't exactly get a chance to ask.

25:45.565 --> 25:46.832
The last thing I remember was

25:46.866 --> 25:48.166
a guy's foot flying across my face.

25:48.200 --> 25:51.202
Maybe Lance was wearing a wire.

25:51.236 --> 25:53.404
That would explain the
microphone and the USB drive.

25:53.439 --> 25:55.674
Nah, Ernest said that
security didn't find a wire,

25:55.708 --> 25:56.908
and there wasn't one on Lance's body.

25:56.943 --> 25:58.844
But let's say he was all wired up

25:58.878 --> 25:59.845
with a briefcase of money.

25:59.879 --> 26:01.379
What the hell was he doing?

26:01.413 --> 26:04.443
Esposito: It's like Lance is running
some kind of half-assed sting operation.

26:04.463 --> 26:06.050
Maybe he was. I spoke to narcotics.

26:06.085 --> 26:09.387
The club that Lance went to
is a major hub for drug sales,

26:09.421 --> 26:12.434
run by a guy that you're familiar with,
Castle.

26:12.807 --> 26:13.924
Is...

26:13.959 --> 26:15.832
Is that Henry Allen Boothe?

26:15.852 --> 26:17.995
El Jafe from "Hard Kill"?

26:18.029 --> 26:19.363
He made a career out
of playing drug dealers

26:19.397 --> 26:22.165
- and then he quit acting.
- And then he began living the part.

26:22.200 --> 26:25.268
Apparently,
he spent so much time with drug dealers

26:25.303 --> 26:27.938
researching his roles that
he actually became one.

26:27.973 --> 26:31.174
Narcotics hasn't been able to
make a case against him, though.

26:31.209 --> 26:32.543
This is just like "Hard Kill,"

26:32.577 --> 26:35.212
where Rico Cruz took down El Jafe.

26:35.246 --> 26:37.214
Only, now it's one actor
taking on the other actor,

26:37.248 --> 26:39.182
but the other actor actually
happens to be a drug dealer.

26:39.217 --> 26:40.017
[Breathes deeply]

26:40.051 --> 26:42.519
But, a-again, why would Lance do this?

26:42.553 --> 26:43.920
Why would he go after Boothe?

26:43.954 --> 26:45.288
I don't know, but it's so meta!

26:45.323 --> 26:46.756
We should really talk to El Jafe.

26:46.790 --> 26:48.225
Oh, believe me... we will.

26:48.259 --> 26:50.860
Yeah, sure, I met with Lance.

26:50.895 --> 26:52.862
What about?

26:52.897 --> 26:54.296
Mm, old times.

26:54.331 --> 26:57.133
He wanted to share a drink,
relive the glory days.

26:57.167 --> 26:58.167
Just out of the blue?

26:58.201 --> 27:00.202
Why not?
"Hard Kill" did a solid for both of us.

27:00.237 --> 27:02.238
Even after all these years,
not a day goes by

27:02.272 --> 27:04.273
where some middle-aged dude doesn't see me

27:04.307 --> 27:05.875
and shout, "El Jafe!"

27:05.910 --> 27:08.044
I suppose I shouldn't complain.

27:08.078 --> 27:10.246
That role bought me this club.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.448
We hear that it did more than that,
Mr. Boothe.

27:14.351 --> 27:15.951
[Laughs]

27:15.985 --> 27:20.722
So the movie drug dealer
becomes a drug dealer, huh?

27:20.757 --> 27:21.590
[Chuckles]

27:21.624 --> 27:24.292
It'd be a good story if it were true.

27:24.326 --> 27:26.494
That being said, I don't discourage it.

27:26.529 --> 27:29.330
A good fiction can do
wonders for one's reputation.

27:29.365 --> 27:31.499
I've learned that every good fiction

27:31.534 --> 27:32.935
contains a kernel of truth.

27:32.969 --> 27:34.903
What happened to the
briefcase that Lance brought

27:34.938 --> 27:37.639
to the meeting,
the one with $200,000 in it?

27:39.675 --> 27:41.276
Lance had no briefcase.

27:41.310 --> 27:42.643
And I suppose your guys
didn't chase him out of here

27:42.678 --> 27:43.744
and then attack him?

27:43.779 --> 27:45.246
Doesn't ring a bell.

27:45.281 --> 27:47.982
- We have a video.
- Not of my guys.

27:48.016 --> 27:49.117
You're welcome to check.

27:49.151 --> 27:50.518
I doubt you'll find any of them here.

27:50.553 --> 27:52.153
And since your next question will be,

27:52.188 --> 27:54.956
"where was I that night?"
I'll save you the oxygen.

27:54.990 --> 27:56.190
There are about 20 people downstairs

27:56.224 --> 27:58.325
who can attest that I
never left the building

27:58.359 --> 28:00.861
after Lance left.

28:00.896 --> 28:03.263
I didn't kill him.

28:03.298 --> 28:06.767
Okay. Thanks for your time.

28:11.039 --> 28:12.839
Castle: "Thanks for your time"?

28:12.873 --> 28:14.308
Beckett, he was lying about the money,

28:14.342 --> 28:15.442
about the meeting, about everything.

28:15.477 --> 28:17.344
Of course he was lying.

28:17.378 --> 28:20.179
So why didn't you push harder?
Why didn't we check his alibi?

28:20.214 --> 28:22.115
Because we didn't need to.

28:22.149 --> 28:24.283
Since when?

28:24.318 --> 28:26.185
Since I figured out what
the numbers 5 and 2 meant.

28:26.220 --> 28:28.654
The missing numbers from the sticker sheet.

28:28.688 --> 28:31.857
The number 52 was on a slot
car in Boothe's collection...

28:31.891 --> 28:33.892
a blue Shelby Cobra to be exact.

28:33.927 --> 28:35.894
That's what Lance was building.

28:35.929 --> 28:37.395
He put a listening device

28:37.430 --> 28:39.397
inside a replica of one of Boothe's cars.

28:39.432 --> 28:41.800
He must have switched them out
when they had that meeting.

28:41.835 --> 28:44.803
Which means that car
was recording everything

28:44.838 --> 28:47.205
that happened in that office,
including why Lance was there.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.574
And why Boothe had him killed.

28:49.609 --> 28:51.376
We need to get that slot car.

28:51.410 --> 28:54.246
We will. We just need a warrant first.

28:56.263 --> 28:57.296
I don't understand.

28:57.330 --> 28:59.390
You're telling me you
can't get a search warrant,

28:59.410 --> 29:01.648
even though that son of a
bitch Boothe is behind this?

29:01.668 --> 29:04.998
Not unless we can provide evidence
that ties Boothe to Lance's death.

29:05.018 --> 29:07.405
And, right now, we can't even
prove that the two of them met.

29:07.440 --> 29:08.406
Look, Mr. Harmon,

29:08.441 --> 29:10.123
we were hoping that you
could help us with this.

29:10.143 --> 29:12.183
Did Lance tell you that
he was going to the club,

29:12.203 --> 29:13.844
that he was gonna talk to Boothe?

29:14.804 --> 29:18.029
Lance never said a word to me
about Boothe or the club, nothing.

29:18.049 --> 29:19.950
Hell, I thought he was in L.A.

29:19.985 --> 29:22.958
I wish I could help you.

29:22.978 --> 29:23.855
Well, you know what?

29:23.889 --> 29:25.825
We'll keep looking for the
men that attacked Lance.

29:25.845 --> 29:27.291
We're not giving up.

29:28.826 --> 29:30.424
Castle.

29:32.030 --> 29:34.631
How did Lance know to bug a slot car?

29:34.665 --> 29:36.033
Oh.

29:36.067 --> 29:37.868
Boothe and his collection

29:37.903 --> 29:40.470
were featured in slotzone magazine.

29:40.505 --> 29:41.538
Hmm.

29:41.572 --> 29:43.673
So you really think the
proof of who killed Lance

29:43.708 --> 29:45.946
is sitting in that
little blue Shelby Cobra?

29:45.966 --> 29:48.460
Well,
doesn't matter if we can't get a warrant.

29:49.651 --> 29:51.214
Too bad Rico Cruz isn't around.

29:51.248 --> 29:53.324
I bet he'd find a way, right?

29:54.919 --> 29:58.087
So, you, uh...
you're a pretty big fan, huh?

29:58.122 --> 29:59.354
Of "Hard Kill"?

29:59.374 --> 30:02.058
No, I was an average, ordinary fan.

30:02.092 --> 30:04.785
Not like I had the "Hard Kill" pajamas.

30:06.997 --> 30:08.590
Say, the, uh, gang and I

30:08.610 --> 30:11.100
are going out for drinks later tonight.

30:11.775 --> 30:13.686
How would you like to come with us?

30:16.758 --> 30:17.940
Castle?

30:18.893 --> 30:20.407
Hey.

30:21.645 --> 30:23.612
You are never gonna
believe what just happened.

30:23.647 --> 30:25.881
Brock invited me to go drinking
with the Indestructibles.

30:25.916 --> 30:28.517
Me with them.

30:28.552 --> 30:29.518
But you told him that you couldn't

30:29.553 --> 30:31.332
because you're in the middle of a case,
right?

30:31.352 --> 30:34.689
No. What? No.
I just... what... isn't it okay if I...

30:34.723 --> 30:36.891
Castle,
you really think that I could stand between

30:36.926 --> 30:39.138
you and your boyhood dream?

30:39.158 --> 30:40.862
You are my boyhood dream.

30:40.896 --> 30:42.397
Aww. [Laughs]

30:42.432 --> 30:44.099
Well,
you and drinking with the Indestructibles.

30:44.133 --> 30:45.733
You don't always have to keep talking.

30:45.768 --> 30:46.734
- Right.
- Yeah.

30:46.769 --> 30:47.936
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go.

30:47.971 --> 30:49.136
I don't know what I'm gonna wear.

30:49.171 --> 30:51.038
[Chuckles] I got to get ready.

30:55.478 --> 30:57.078
[Chuckles] All right.

30:57.112 --> 30:58.646
[Laughs] Okay.

30:58.681 --> 31:03.751
Well, you guys...
you have no idea how excited I am to...

31:05.752 --> 31:08.122
You guys just come from set or something?

31:08.156 --> 31:10.929

Let's roll.

31:12.327 --> 31:14.795
[Tires squeal]

31:15.049 --> 31:17.965
So, um... What's going on?

31:18.000 --> 31:21.135
No warrant is gonna stop us from
getting our hands on evidence

31:21.169 --> 31:24.404
- to put away Lance's killer.
- Somebody takes out one of our own,

31:24.438 --> 31:25.572
we take him out.

31:25.607 --> 31:27.841
Oh, guys, hey,

31:27.876 --> 31:30.890
listen, if your plan is to go to the club
and steal that slot car,

31:30.910 --> 31:33.725
N-no. That would...
that would taint the evidence.

31:33.745 --> 31:36.149
Actually,
we can compel the D.A. to consider it

31:36.183 --> 31:39.119
since the car technically
belonged to the victim, Lance.

31:39.153 --> 31:41.060
You really are a genius, aren't you?

31:41.080 --> 31:43.423
Also, none of us is an agent of the law.

31:43.457 --> 31:45.091
It's one of the reasons I chose you.

31:45.126 --> 31:47.193
And because you have
been in Boothe's office.

31:47.228 --> 31:50.180
You're gonna help us find that slot car.

31:50.200 --> 31:53.199
No. No. No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

31:53.234 --> 31:57.136
Guys, my wife is a cop.
If I do this, she'll kill me.

31:57.170 --> 31:58.971
[Mockingly] "Oh, my wife's gonna kill me."

31:59.006 --> 32:00.139
Is that what Rico Cruz would say?

32:00.173 --> 32:01.807
No.

32:01.842 --> 32:04.209
- But what if we get caught?
- We're not gonna get caught.

32:04.244 --> 32:06.522
We're the Indestructibles.

32:06.869 --> 32:09.314

This is so not what I expected.

36:00.639 --> 36:02.575
Oh, my God.

36:05.190 --> 36:06.650
So, what's this about?

36:06.670 --> 36:09.417
Trey,
how well do you know Henry Allen Boothe?

36:09.437 --> 36:12.177
Well, if someone owns a club,
it's my job to know them.

36:12.197 --> 36:14.913
I met him through my dad.
They did a few movies together.

36:14.933 --> 36:16.766
In fact, Boothe invested some seed money

36:16.801 --> 36:18.673
so you could become a club promoter.

36:18.693 --> 36:19.889
Then, as a promoter,

36:19.909 --> 36:21.887
you had access to all
the clubs in the city.

36:21.907 --> 36:23.072
Boothe used that access

36:23.106 --> 36:27.718
to sell drugs in those clubs,
or so we're told by narcotics.

36:28.859 --> 36:31.192
I don't hear you denying this, Trey.

36:32.756 --> 36:34.351
I didn't know about the drugs at first,

36:34.385 --> 36:36.886
and once I did, it was too late.

36:36.920 --> 36:38.888
- He owned me.
- Let me guess...

36:38.922 --> 36:41.590
Boothe said you could buy him out,

36:41.624 --> 36:43.592
but at a price he knew
you could never afford.

36:43.626 --> 36:45.728
What was it? $200,000?

36:46.435 --> 36:48.630
You didn't tell your parents
about any of this, did you?

36:48.665 --> 36:51.033
I wanted to make my own way,

36:51.068 --> 36:53.970
not have Brock Harmon come to the rescue.

36:54.004 --> 36:55.437
But Lance found out.

36:55.472 --> 36:58.874
He tried to buy out Boothe,
pay your ransom,

36:58.908 --> 37:01.504
just like Rico Cruz did in "Hard Kill."

37:01.524 --> 37:03.812
Yeah, and I begged him not to.

37:03.847 --> 37:05.414
This wasn't some movie.

37:05.448 --> 37:07.607
I knew that Boothe wasn't gonna let me go,

37:07.627 --> 37:09.618
and Lance couldn't just walk
in there with a bag of money

37:09.652 --> 37:10.819
and fix things.

37:10.854 --> 37:12.993
But, suddenly, he wanted to be a hero.

37:13.013 --> 37:14.622
I told him he was gonna get us both killed.

37:14.656 --> 37:17.847
But he only got himself
killed trying to save you.

37:18.827 --> 37:21.562
We have an audio recording
of Boothe from that night.

37:22.278 --> 37:23.258
How?

37:23.278 --> 37:24.565
Lance bugged his office.

37:24.600 --> 37:26.834
After Boothe kicked
Lance out of his office,

37:26.869 --> 37:28.305
he sent his men after him.

37:28.325 --> 37:31.469
Lance gave them a beatdown
worthy of an action hero.

37:31.489 --> 37:33.941
That's when Boothe made this phone call.

37:33.975 --> 37:35.576
[Keyboard clacks]

37:35.611 --> 37:37.978
Booth: Trey, your pal Lance was here.

37:38.013 --> 37:39.680
I think you know why.

37:39.715 --> 37:42.583
He's on the run somewhere
near that theater playing "Hard Kill."

37:42.618 --> 37:44.685
He's your problem now.

37:44.720 --> 37:46.353
You need to take care of
him to make this right,

37:46.388 --> 37:48.588
or I'll take care of you.

37:50.085 --> 37:52.485
You do that, Trey. Get it... Done.

37:52.505 --> 37:53.593
[Keyboard clacks]

37:54.329 --> 37:56.964
You were so afraid of
Boothe that you killed Lance

37:56.998 --> 37:58.698
in order to save your own skin.

37:58.733 --> 37:59.699
I would never do that.

37:59.734 --> 38:02.168
It sounds like that's
exactly what you did do.

38:02.202 --> 38:04.433
Now, what happened after you hung up?

38:04.669 --> 38:06.606
I freaked.

38:06.641 --> 38:09.443
I called my mom, told her everything,

38:09.477 --> 38:11.155
the whole story.

38:11.175 --> 38:13.880
She said to lay low,
that she'd call a lawyer.

38:13.915 --> 38:17.050
And then, the next morning, Lance was dead.

38:17.084 --> 38:19.618
I figured Boothe's guys got to him.

38:20.371 --> 38:22.249
Look, I was at my office all night.

38:22.269 --> 38:24.857
I slept there. The cleaning crew saw me.

38:24.891 --> 38:27.891
I swear to you I did not kill Lance.

38:28.449 --> 38:30.273
And I don't know who did.

38:33.008 --> 38:34.410
Tell me, Trey...

38:34.430 --> 38:37.035
why would Lance go through
all this trouble to help you?

38:37.070 --> 38:39.204
I don't know.

38:39.238 --> 38:43.041
He just said that the
cancer really woke him up

38:43.076 --> 38:46.044
and that, uh, after all this was over,

38:46.079 --> 38:49.324
there were some things
that he wanted to tell me.

38:52.018 --> 38:54.600
So,
the cleaning crew confirmed Trey's story.

38:54.620 --> 38:56.254
He is not our killer.

38:56.289 --> 38:58.991
Maybe it was one of Boothe's men.
We still haven't ruled them out.

38:59.025 --> 38:59.891
Ryan: Hey, guys.

38:59.925 --> 39:01.659
I just found something very interesting.

39:01.694 --> 39:03.467
- The identity of the killer.
- No, not that.

39:03.487 --> 39:06.164
You know how Trey said that
Lance's cancer woke him up?

39:06.199 --> 39:08.099
Well, I just spoke to his doctor.

39:08.133 --> 39:09.934
When Lance got the name
of his bone-marrow donor

39:09.969 --> 39:12.336
to thank him,
he found out there was a second donor

39:12.371 --> 39:13.938
who was a very close match.

39:13.973 --> 39:15.607
Take a look at that name.

39:18.577 --> 39:19.911
[Indistinct conversations]

39:24.523 --> 39:26.414
Have you released Trey yet?

39:26.434 --> 39:27.684
He had nothing to do with this.

39:27.719 --> 39:30.021
Actually,
Trey has everything to do with this.

39:30.055 --> 39:31.755
I'm not sure I understand.

39:31.789 --> 39:34.125
When Lance needed a bone-marrow transplant,

39:34.159 --> 39:36.093
Trey gave a sample to
see if he could donate.

39:36.128 --> 39:38.129
We all did. It was the least we could do.

39:38.163 --> 39:41.131
Except Trey's sample was nearly a match.

39:41.165 --> 39:42.198
Lance must have had his suspicions

39:42.233 --> 39:46.069
because he ran a paternity
test on that sample.

39:46.103 --> 39:47.538
Trey was his son.

39:47.572 --> 39:49.372
No.

39:49.407 --> 39:51.909
He would have been conceived
during the filming of "Hard Kill,"

39:51.943 --> 39:54.781
which is inconvenient,
since you were already married to Brock.

39:54.801 --> 39:56.637
We spoke to your doorman, Naomi.

39:56.657 --> 39:58.615
He said that you didn't come home

39:58.635 --> 40:00.083
until well after midnight the
night that Lance was killed,

40:00.117 --> 40:01.184
so where were you?

40:01.218 --> 40:03.953
I didn't kill Lance,
if that's what you're suggesting.

40:03.987 --> 40:05.821
You're more than capable of it.

40:05.856 --> 40:07.424
You don't just have a mean roundhouse.

40:07.458 --> 40:09.092
You hold two black belts.

40:09.126 --> 40:10.762
Okay, you need to leave.

40:10.782 --> 40:12.895
We matched the wire.

40:12.930 --> 40:14.797
The wire that you use
for your jewelry line,

40:14.831 --> 40:16.999
like the necklace that
you're wearing right now...

40:17.034 --> 40:18.133
it's an exact match to our murder weapon.

40:18.153 --> 40:19.168
Trey told you

40:19.202 --> 40:21.707
that Lance had something
important to tell him.

40:21.727 --> 40:23.973
You knew the truth would come out.

40:26.985 --> 40:28.978
Lance would have destroyed everything...

40:29.012 --> 40:30.845
my marriage, my family,

40:30.880 --> 40:35.031
everything that I spent almost
30 years trying to build.

40:35.957 --> 40:38.892
I couldn't let him do that.

40:41.759 --> 40:43.858
What's going on?

40:44.414 --> 40:46.628
You might be interested to
know that Henry Allen Boothe

40:46.662 --> 40:49.060
was just arrested by narcotics.

40:49.396 --> 40:50.932
I thought they couldn't make a case.

40:50.967 --> 40:53.301
Well, they couldn't,
but when Trey learned the truth

40:53.335 --> 40:55.136
about why Lance really did all this,

40:55.170 --> 40:58.206
he stepped up and decided
to testify against Boothe.

40:58.240 --> 41:01.943
So good work,
Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle.

41:01.978 --> 41:02.911
Don't stay late.

41:02.945 --> 41:04.812
You can finish the
paperwork in the morning.

41:04.846 --> 41:06.147
Thank you, sir.

41:06.181 --> 41:07.348
Wow.

41:07.382 --> 41:10.151
Looks like Lance managed to
vanquish his nemesis after all.

41:10.185 --> 41:12.286
An ending worthy of one of his movies.

41:12.321 --> 41:14.054
You know...

41:14.089 --> 41:16.680
maybe we should watch
"Hard Kill" tonight...

41:16.991 --> 41:17.891
In his honor.

41:17.926 --> 41:19.494
I was just gonna suggest
the exact same thing.

41:19.528 --> 41:21.695
We're starting to think alike now.

41:21.730 --> 41:24.131
That is horrifying.
Okay, uh, go cue up the movie.

41:24.165 --> 41:26.399
Open up a bottle of wine.
I'll be home in a bit.

41:26.434 --> 41:28.301
I've just got a stop to make first.

41:28.336 --> 41:30.070
Well,
if I'm thinking what you're thinking...

41:30.105 --> 41:32.139
and it's to pick up a sexy
archaeologist costume...

41:32.173 --> 41:33.140
don't worry.

41:33.174 --> 41:35.658
I've already got the whip.

41:39.269 --> 41:41.648
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
