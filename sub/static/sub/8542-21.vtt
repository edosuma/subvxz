00:04.178 --> 00:06.049
[helicopter whirring]

00:06.136 --> 00:07.877
[pizza delivery man]
'I could see the glow
from around the corner.'

00:07.964 --> 00:09.400
'I thought the whole alley
was on fire.'

00:09.487 --> 00:10.880
[Lisbon]
'What were you doing out here?'

00:10.967 --> 00:12.360
[pizza delivery man]
'Delivering pizzas.'

00:12.447 --> 00:14.275
'I like to use this alley
as a shortcut.'

00:14.362 --> 00:16.320
And did you see anybody
when you were out?

00:16.407 --> 00:20.020
No, just, uh, you know,
the guy in the car

00:20.107 --> 00:22.587
'and I didn't even see him
at first. Too much smoke.'

00:22.674 --> 00:25.460
- Was he still alive?
- 'I don't think so, no.'

00:25.547 --> 00:27.288
'I mean, how could he be'

00:27.375 --> 00:29.507
'handcuffed inside a burning
car?'

00:29.594 --> 00:30.943
'Who is he, anyway?'

00:31.031 --> 00:33.424
[Lisbon]
'We're still working on that.'

00:33.511 --> 00:36.775
Poor bastard. Burned alive?
That's no way to to go.

00:42.651 --> 00:43.695
[helicopter whirring]

00:58.275 --> 00:59.668
[clank]

00:59.755 --> 01:03.280
Oh, hey, Cho.
Scared the hell out of me.

01:03.367 --> 01:05.587
I just found these.

01:05.674 --> 01:08.198
That's very careless
of someone

01:08.285 --> 01:09.243
or perhaps careful.

01:26.695 --> 01:28.000
[crackling]

01:32.179 --> 01:33.571
What'd you find?

01:33.658 --> 01:35.051
Not sure yet.

01:37.314 --> 01:38.663
Cover me.

02:02.513 --> 02:04.036
[upbeat music]

02:07.649 --> 02:11.131
Oh!
We'll be out soon.

02:11.218 --> 02:13.785
Oh, we're not here
for what you're here for.

02:13.872 --> 02:15.178
Does this belong to anyone?

02:15.265 --> 02:17.615
[murmuring]

02:17.702 --> 02:19.226
I guess it's true
what they say

02:19.313 --> 02:22.011
time wounds all heels,
these are my favorite.

02:22.098 --> 02:24.231
I'm agent Lisbon with the CBI.
What's your name?

02:24.318 --> 02:27.103
Glennda Snow.
I'm the emcee of our troupe.

02:27.190 --> 02:28.496
We do a cabaret.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.802
We found your heel
in the alleyway

02:30.889 --> 02:32.239
along with a dead man.

02:32.326 --> 02:33.892
He'd been set on fire.

02:33.979 --> 02:37.287
Oh, we heard the sirens outside,
but we had no idea.

02:37.374 --> 02:38.593
What were you doing
in the alley?

02:38.680 --> 02:40.551
Enjoying an ultra slim.

02:40.638 --> 02:43.293
I always smoke a cigarette
before the first show.

02:43.380 --> 02:45.382
And what time were you
out there?

02:45.469 --> 02:47.558
I don't know exactly. 8:30?

02:47.645 --> 02:49.734
The arson investigator
says the fire was set

02:49.821 --> 02:51.997
sometime
between 8:45 and 9:00.

02:52.084 --> 02:53.216
Oh, well, Glennda was with us
by then.

02:53.303 --> 02:54.739
Yeah, that's right.

02:54.826 --> 02:56.263
She helped me
into my compression garments.

02:56.350 --> 02:57.960
I was. Who died? Who was it?

02:58.047 --> 02:59.657
- We don't know.
- Two minutes to curtain, girls.

02:59.744 --> 03:01.529
Whoo!

03:01.616 --> 03:03.835
If you'll excuse me,
the stage is calling.

03:03.922 --> 03:06.621
Hang on a minute. Did you see
anybody in the alley?

03:06.708 --> 03:08.362
As a matter of fact,
there was a man

03:08.449 --> 03:10.320
in a parked car,
watching me.

03:10.407 --> 03:11.495
What did he look like?

03:11.582 --> 03:13.193
I couldn't see his face,
it was dark

03:13.280 --> 03:14.411
'but I felt vulnerable'

03:14.498 --> 03:16.065
'so I hightailed it back
into the club'

03:16.152 --> 03:17.762
and that's when I felt
my heel break.

03:17.849 --> 03:20.156
Why didn't you pick up
your heel?

03:20.243 --> 03:22.593
In this dress, darling?

03:22.680 --> 03:25.596
[male announcer]
'It's time to welcome
the Sacramento princess'

03:25.683 --> 03:29.861
'you're dying to possess,
the delectable Glennda Snow!'

03:29.948 --> 03:31.907
[applause]

03:31.994 --> 03:33.474
[upbeat music]

03:37.521 --> 03:39.175
I think he's telling
the truth.

03:39.262 --> 03:40.742
I don't know.
The other drag queens

03:40.829 --> 03:42.396
could have been
covering for him.

03:42.483 --> 03:44.876
Well, I find it unlikely
that a man in heels

03:44.963 --> 03:47.488
sequins, and, uh,
an elaborate hairstyle

03:47.575 --> 03:50.142
would subdue and handcuff
another man

03:50.230 --> 03:51.883
and then set him on fire.

03:51.970 --> 03:55.191
Oh, no.
Oh, please don't. Please.

03:55.278 --> 03:57.976
Then again,
he's very forceful.

03:58.063 --> 03:59.630
[applause]

03:59.717 --> 04:02.154
Oh, and extremely limber.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.418
[theme music]

04:14.515 --> 04:16.604
Car was registered
to Archie Bloom.

04:16.691 --> 04:18.649
Local boy, 19 years old.

04:18.736 --> 04:20.390
Forensics requested
dental records

04:20.477 --> 04:21.609
to confirm
he's the victim.

04:21.696 --> 04:23.088
Have we contacted
the parents?

04:23.175 --> 04:25.177
Sacramento P.D. Spoke
with his father last night

04:25.265 --> 04:26.527
Archie Bloom Sr.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.268
He's a local superintendent
of schools.

04:28.355 --> 04:30.008
Uh, well, what do we know
about the cause of death?

04:30.095 --> 04:32.750
Nothing till the autopsy,
but the coroner found no cause

04:32.837 --> 04:34.143
to contradict the theory
that he was burned alive.

04:34.230 --> 04:35.579
Then that's
how we'll proceed.

04:35.666 --> 04:36.928
What was the victim doing
in that alley?

04:37.015 --> 04:38.539
We don't know.

04:38.626 --> 04:40.802
Uh, the fire was set outside
a drag queen venue

04:40.889 --> 04:41.933
but there's
a dozen businesses

04:42.020 --> 04:43.544
that open up
onto that alley.

04:43.631 --> 04:45.589
Archie could have been tied
to any one of 'em.

04:45.676 --> 04:47.199
Sac P.D. wants to help
on this one.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.027
I'll ask them to show
the victim's photo around.

04:49.114 --> 04:50.507
One thing I do know
is we've got

04:50.594 --> 04:51.943
a lot of fingerprints
to work with.

04:52.030 --> 04:53.641
On the car, on the gas can.

04:53.728 --> 04:56.121
They even found a partial
on the handcuffs.

04:56.208 --> 04:57.732
I checked the bar code
on one of those gas cans.

04:57.819 --> 04:58.733
It came
from a local discount store

04:58.820 --> 05:00.082
Bargain Emporium.

05:00.169 --> 05:01.431
You and Rigsby go
and check it out.

05:01.518 --> 05:03.868
- Alright.
- Okay.

05:03.955 --> 05:06.654
I want you and Jane to go
talk to Archie Sr.

05:06.741 --> 05:09.004
He's gonna want to believe
his son's alive.

05:09.091 --> 05:10.658
Careful not to build up
his hope.

05:10.745 --> 05:11.833
Alright.

05:16.968 --> 05:19.406
He's dead, isn't he?

05:19.493 --> 05:21.625
I know he's dead.

05:21.712 --> 05:24.193
'It was his car, right?'

05:24.280 --> 05:26.282
We're still waiting
for a positive I.D.

05:26.369 --> 05:29.851
But you're moving forward
on the premise that it was him.

05:29.938 --> 05:32.506
Am I right?

05:32.593 --> 05:34.377
Yes.

05:34.464 --> 05:36.074
Thank you.

05:38.076 --> 05:41.428
- You don't seem surprised.
- I'm not.

05:41.515 --> 05:43.865
My son was a victim
his whole life.

05:43.952 --> 05:45.301
Never a murder victim.

05:45.388 --> 05:48.652
No, but it was
my deepest fear

05:48.739 --> 05:51.655
that Archie would get himself
into a dangerous situation.

05:51.742 --> 05:53.788
- He was a troublemaker?
- Exactly the opposite.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.790
He was the target
of troublemakers.

05:55.877 --> 05:59.315
Soft, I suppose you could say.

05:59.402 --> 06:02.187
'That's why it was so hard
asking him to move out.'

06:02.274 --> 06:03.754
Archie hadn't been
living here?

06:03.841 --> 06:05.582
We had a deal. I would
provide room and board

06:05.669 --> 06:07.062
while he earned
a college degree.

06:07.149 --> 06:09.717
But six months ago..

06:09.804 --> 06:12.720
...Archie decided that college
wasn't his thing.

06:12.807 --> 06:15.462
So you invited him to leave?

06:15.549 --> 06:18.247
It was a teaching moment.

06:18.334 --> 06:21.337
[sniffles]
Painful, but necessary.

06:21.424 --> 06:22.512
How'd your wife feel
about that?

06:22.599 --> 06:25.646
My wife died
when he was 6 years old.

06:25.733 --> 06:28.910
It's been the Archies
ever since.

06:28.997 --> 06:30.955
The boy was nothing
like me.

06:31.042 --> 06:32.870
Why, because he's gay?

06:34.132 --> 06:35.917
I don't..

06:37.962 --> 06:39.616
...was he?

06:39.703 --> 06:41.705
Is that what it says
in your files?

06:43.881 --> 06:45.317
We don't keep files
on gay people.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.928
I mean, it's okay
if he was.

06:47.015 --> 06:50.540
I would never judge anyone
based on such criteria.

06:50.627 --> 06:52.455
But if he was

06:52.542 --> 06:53.761
he never talked
to me about it.

06:53.848 --> 06:56.024
I have to ask,
procedure and all.

06:56.111 --> 06:58.896
Where were you last night
at 8:45?

06:58.983 --> 07:00.898
Home alone. Working.

07:00.985 --> 07:03.814
I'm writing a book
on educational theory.

07:03.901 --> 07:06.556
I'd like to take a look
at your son's bedroom

07:06.643 --> 07:09.037
if you don't mind.

07:09.124 --> 07:10.647
Down the hall
on your right.

07:16.523 --> 07:18.307
How did you know
Archie was gay?

07:18.394 --> 07:21.919
Well, Archie Sr. Named his son
after himself, like a king.

07:22.006 --> 07:23.834
He was hoping for an heir

07:23.921 --> 07:28.535
yet there's not one photo
of junior in the house.

07:28.622 --> 07:29.623
You think
he's ashamed of him.

07:29.710 --> 07:30.928
I mean,
well, look at this room.

07:31.015 --> 07:33.148
Traditional masculine decor.

07:33.235 --> 07:35.672
Bold nautical themes.

07:35.759 --> 07:38.283
It's like a furniture catalog
threw up in here.

07:38.370 --> 07:40.547
Yes.

07:40.634 --> 07:44.464
These are not the choices
of a teenager.

07:44.551 --> 07:48.250
I think Archie Sr. personally
decorated this room

07:48.337 --> 07:52.559
in the attempt
to butch-up his gay son.

07:52.646 --> 07:54.169
Should've seen
my room back home.

07:54.256 --> 07:56.911
Posters everywhere.

07:56.998 --> 07:58.608
Let me guess. Hanson?

07:58.695 --> 08:00.741
They wrote their own music.

08:00.828 --> 08:03.874
Ah. Looks like Archie did hang
something on the wall.

08:03.961 --> 08:06.790
I'm guessing that was a photo
of him and his mother.

08:06.877 --> 08:08.400
What's on his computer?

08:08.488 --> 08:09.924
It's password-protected.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.665
I'll have to take
the hard drive back to CBI

08:11.752 --> 08:12.927
and run
some recovery software.

08:13.014 --> 08:14.842
Oh, okay. You do that.

08:33.251 --> 08:34.426
Thank you for coming.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.124
The woman on the phone said

08:36.211 --> 08:38.256
that you'd like me to help
with your investigation.

08:38.343 --> 08:40.563
Yes. We need to see
if your fingerprints match

08:40.650 --> 08:42.260
the prints we found
at the crime scene.

08:42.347 --> 08:44.785
Oh, so I'm
a person of interest?

08:44.872 --> 08:46.656
Yeah, you are.

08:46.743 --> 08:47.788
Hmm.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.920
Can I ask you something?

08:50.007 --> 08:51.226
Do you always go out
like this?

08:51.313 --> 08:52.923
In drag, I mean.

08:53.010 --> 08:54.795
Whenever I get dressed,
I try to consider

08:54.882 --> 08:57.145
where I'm going,
who I'm going to see

08:57.232 --> 09:00.452
and how I can
blow them away.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.543
Let me escort you
to fingerprinting.

09:03.630 --> 09:06.850
A police escort.
How could I refuse?

09:11.420 --> 09:13.857
We keep the gas cans
back here on aisle 12.

09:13.944 --> 09:16.164
Yeah. Here we go.

09:16.251 --> 09:17.818
Those are the ones.

09:17.905 --> 09:18.949
What kind of crime
were they used in?

09:19.036 --> 09:20.385
We can't go
into the details

09:20.472 --> 09:22.039
but maybe you can
help us out.

09:22.126 --> 09:25.477
Have you ever seen
this man in the store?

09:25.565 --> 09:27.741
Archie? I hope so.

09:27.828 --> 09:31.179
He works here.
What did he do?

09:31.266 --> 09:33.224
His car was found on fire
last night.

09:33.311 --> 09:34.574
There was a body inside.

09:34.661 --> 09:38.055
- Oh, no. Well, was it--
- We don't know yet.

09:38.142 --> 09:39.361
How long did Archie work here?

09:39.448 --> 09:40.841
Uh, a couple months, maybe.

09:40.928 --> 09:42.973
Do you know anyone
who wanted to hurt him?

09:43.060 --> 09:44.279
Yeah.

09:44.366 --> 09:46.498
Rick. Total douche.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.849
- Rick?
- Rick Hughes.

09:48.936 --> 09:51.678
He stocks shelves
and quotes Fight Club.

09:51.765 --> 09:54.506
He picks on Archie
all the time.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.726
Last week, Archie had
bruises all over.

09:56.813 --> 09:57.858
He wouldn't tell me
what happened

09:57.945 --> 09:59.381
but I'll bet it was Rick.

09:59.468 --> 10:02.036
- Is Rick here now?
- In the loading bay.

10:03.428 --> 10:05.082
You take it.

10:05.169 --> 10:06.301
A couple more things..

10:08.085 --> 10:10.305
- Rick Hughes?
- That's right.

10:10.392 --> 10:11.611
Let's talk about
Archie Bloom.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.528
Who are you, his bodyguard?

10:16.616 --> 10:18.705
Why would
Archie need a bodyguard?

10:18.792 --> 10:21.359
[chuckles]
If you don't know..

10:21.446 --> 10:24.319
CBI. We have reason to believe
Archie was murdered last night.

10:24.406 --> 10:26.190
For real? How?

10:26.277 --> 10:28.018
You tell me.

10:28.105 --> 10:29.541
That's what this is about?

10:29.629 --> 10:31.413
Come on, man. I never laid
a finger on Archie.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.588
That's not what I heard.

10:32.675 --> 10:33.850
[buzzes]

10:36.810 --> 10:39.377
You heard wrong.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.379
Are you trying to say
you never hassled Archie?

10:41.466 --> 10:44.208
I always hassled Archie.
So what?

10:44.295 --> 10:47.168
We worked together,
but I liked him, you know?

10:47.255 --> 10:50.258
Every time I'd come across
defective merchandise back here

10:50.345 --> 10:51.346
I'd give it to him
as a gift.

10:51.433 --> 10:53.261
What'd you give him?

10:53.348 --> 10:56.133
Stuffed animals. An apron.

10:56.220 --> 10:57.657
[laughs]

10:59.659 --> 11:01.661
What?

11:04.533 --> 11:06.448
This was Archie's locker.

11:08.755 --> 11:11.018
I take it he wasn't the one
who added the decorations.

11:11.105 --> 11:14.978
No. That would be Rick.
Textbook homophobe.

11:15.065 --> 11:18.068
My manager told him to stop,
but guys like that..

11:18.155 --> 11:20.723
Well, if it was so bad,
why didn't Archie just quit?

11:20.810 --> 11:24.074
He said it wasn't any different
at his last job.

11:24.161 --> 11:28.818
He wanted to learn how
to handle it better.

11:28.905 --> 11:32.256
I gotta go back
to the register.

11:32.343 --> 11:33.301
Shut the locker
when you're done.

11:33.388 --> 11:35.172
Sure. Thank you.

11:59.762 --> 12:01.633
[cell phone vibrates]

12:03.592 --> 12:05.202
Rigsby.

12:05.289 --> 12:07.727
Hey, it's Lisbon.
The dental records came back.

12:07.814 --> 12:11.426
The body inside the car has been
confirmed as Archie Bloom.

12:11.513 --> 12:13.167
[Wayne]
'Oh, that's too bad.'

12:13.254 --> 12:15.778
His father gave us an address
where he was renting.

12:15.865 --> 12:18.259
Yeah, if you don't mind,
I'll get Cho to check it out.

12:18.346 --> 12:20.435
Archie worked in the store here,
and I think I found a lead

12:20.522 --> 12:22.219
'that I want to run down
at the office.'

12:22.306 --> 12:23.743
Okay.

12:26.528 --> 12:27.703
Looks like the whole roll
was taken.

12:27.790 --> 12:28.965
Call me as soon
as you process the film.

12:29.052 --> 12:30.401
Thank you.

12:39.193 --> 12:41.325
Um...
after you.

12:42.805 --> 12:45.286
Such a gentleman.

12:51.422 --> 12:53.468
Well, Glennda's prints
don't match any of the prints

12:53.555 --> 12:55.165
at the crime scene

12:55.252 --> 12:57.037
and I did background checks
on the drag queens.

12:57.124 --> 12:58.473
None of them stand out.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.431
Oh, don't let them
hear you say that.

13:00.518 --> 13:01.868
Hey, you guys.

13:01.955 --> 13:04.000
I found some videos
on Archie's hard drive.

13:04.087 --> 13:05.828
They're inside
a hidden partition.

13:05.915 --> 13:07.787
Looks like Archie didn't want
prying eyes to see.

13:07.874 --> 13:09.614
You found something?

13:10.659 --> 13:11.878
Can you play the files?

13:11.965 --> 13:13.618
[Grace]
'I think so.'

13:20.364 --> 13:22.889
Nice guy.

13:22.976 --> 13:24.804
So it seems.

13:24.891 --> 13:27.328
Okay. Got it.
Uh..

13:27.415 --> 13:29.243
Most of these files
look like they were created

13:29.330 --> 13:32.115
two or three years ago,
when Archie was in high school.

13:32.202 --> 13:36.641
[Archie Sr.]
'No, I am done asking!'

13:36.728 --> 13:38.861
'Sit. Sit in that chair.
I said, sit down!'

13:38.948 --> 13:41.864
'Now you are gonna do
exactly as I tell you.'

13:41.951 --> 13:45.389
'You put your left arm
on the chair.'

13:45.476 --> 13:46.913
- You're hurting me.
-Stop whining!

13:47.000 --> 13:49.263
Are you kidding? Handcuffs?

13:49.350 --> 13:52.092
Latest educational tool.

13:52.179 --> 13:54.964
'Sit here all night long
until your homework is done.'

13:55.051 --> 13:57.793
Maybe this will
toughen you up.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.664
Wait. Pause the video.

13:59.751 --> 14:01.101
'Those are hinged handcuffs'

14:01.188 --> 14:03.407
just like the ones
used in the victim's murder.

14:03.494 --> 14:06.410
I'm guessing this wasn't
the first daddy dearest routine.

14:06.497 --> 14:08.412
Archie had that camera
set up and recording

14:08.499 --> 14:09.979
before they walked
into the room.

14:10.066 --> 14:11.415
Play it further.

14:17.378 --> 14:19.597
Somebody... help me.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.693
Tactical handcuffs,
dual-hinged

14:28.780 --> 14:31.958
the same make you used
to chain your son to his desk.

14:32.045 --> 14:34.177
What are you talking
about?

14:34.264 --> 14:38.660
Archie secretly videotaped it.
We found it on his computer.

14:38.747 --> 14:40.444
You don't understand
what you were watching.

14:40.531 --> 14:42.185
Enlighten us.

14:42.272 --> 14:43.926
The relationship
between completed homework

14:44.013 --> 14:47.234
and academic achievement
is statistically compelling.

14:47.321 --> 14:48.888
With Archie,
aggressive techniques

14:48.975 --> 14:50.890
were necessary
to keep him motivated.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.065
Oh, you motivated him,
alright

14:52.152 --> 14:53.370
right out of college.

14:53.457 --> 14:55.068
That was his failure,
not mine.

14:55.155 --> 14:57.809
A dropout for a son doesn't
look good on the Wikipedia page

14:57.897 --> 15:00.769
of a wannabe educational giant,
does it?

15:00.856 --> 15:02.423
Is that why you killed him?

15:03.424 --> 15:06.079
My own son?

15:06.166 --> 15:08.342
Because the cuffs happen
to look like mine?

15:08.429 --> 15:10.083
We found your fingerprints
on 'em.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.606
That's impossible.

15:12.476 --> 15:15.262
Unless..

15:15.349 --> 15:18.221
...I suppose that someone could
have stolen them from my office.

15:18.308 --> 15:20.658
- You're gonna take that route?
- I know how that sounds.

15:20.745 --> 15:22.660
You know, you should consider
a lie detector test.

15:22.747 --> 15:25.011
- It'll clear all this up.
- Happily.

15:25.098 --> 15:28.579
- Give me your hand.
- Excuse me?

15:28.666 --> 15:30.581
You said, happily.

15:33.497 --> 15:37.893
Okay, just a couple
of irrelevant questions

15:37.980 --> 15:39.286
to establish a baseline.

15:39.373 --> 15:41.027
- What's your name?
- Archie Bloom.

15:41.114 --> 15:43.203
- You love your son?
- Yes.

15:43.290 --> 15:45.988
Were you ashamed of him?

15:46.075 --> 15:49.296
It's an irrelevant question.
I already know the answer.

15:49.383 --> 15:51.472
The truth, please.

15:51.559 --> 15:54.257
Were you ashamed
of your son?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.610
Yes.

16:02.657 --> 16:04.876
Did you kill him?

16:04.964 --> 16:06.791
No.

16:06.878 --> 16:08.402
No, I didn't.

16:12.319 --> 16:14.364
So, do you think
he killed the victim?

16:14.451 --> 16:16.671
He did, well, at least
he feels like he did.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.368
Hard to be certain.

16:18.455 --> 16:20.631
Guilt comes in many forms.

16:20.718 --> 16:22.242
That's the best you can do?

16:22.329 --> 16:24.157
For now.

16:24.244 --> 16:25.897
- What?
- Are you wearing perfume?

16:25.985 --> 16:27.638
Right.

16:27.725 --> 16:29.684
Well, you've been standing
close to someone that is.

16:29.771 --> 16:32.208
Uh, that would be Glennda.
She's very fragrant.

16:32.295 --> 16:33.993
You just called Glennda
she.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.560
- So?
- You didn't before.

16:36.647 --> 16:38.649
- I have to go.
- Where?

16:38.736 --> 16:41.217
I just had a thoughtless impulse
or an inspired hunch.

16:41.304 --> 16:44.829
I'm not sure which yet.
I'll let you know.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.231
How you doin'?

16:56.145 --> 16:57.842
Agent Cho. CBI.

16:57.929 --> 16:59.670
Well, you're not here
to buy a book. Who died?

16:59.757 --> 17:01.237
Archie Bloom.

17:04.501 --> 17:08.331
"Something good will come
of all things yet."

17:08.418 --> 17:09.550
How did Archie die?

17:09.637 --> 17:11.334
Homicide.

17:11.421 --> 17:14.816
His father gave us this address
as his last known residence.

17:14.903 --> 17:17.036
My apartment's upstairs.

17:17.123 --> 17:20.996
I rent out my spare room
to help cover my lease.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.738
Hard to remain
a viable literary watering hole

17:23.825 --> 17:27.568
when the counterculture
is free online.

17:27.655 --> 17:29.657
Tell me about your relationship
with the victim.

17:29.744 --> 17:33.922
Sacramento is a place
of wide lawns and narrow minds.

17:34.009 --> 17:35.750
Archie came here
to nourish his soul.

17:35.837 --> 17:37.186
When he mentioned
his father kicked him out

17:37.273 --> 17:39.493
I was only too happy
to rent him a room.

17:39.580 --> 17:40.972
When was the last time
you saw him?

17:41.060 --> 17:42.322
I haven't seen Archie
in a week.

17:42.409 --> 17:44.193
He cleared out
without leaving a note

17:44.280 --> 17:46.369
orhis last month's rent.

17:46.456 --> 17:48.632
Any idea why?

17:48.719 --> 17:50.243
Was he in trouble?

17:50.330 --> 17:53.811
"I have nothing to offer anybody
but my own confusion."

17:56.423 --> 17:58.599
- Kerouac.
- No. Kesey.

17:58.686 --> 18:00.296
Influenced by Kerouac.

18:00.383 --> 18:01.341
Common mistake.

18:01.428 --> 18:02.907
No. You.

18:02.994 --> 18:05.954
You keep quoting Kerouac,
an overrated bum.

18:06.041 --> 18:08.217
I need you to answer
my questions in your own words.

18:08.304 --> 18:11.438
Where were you
last night at 8:45?

18:14.615 --> 18:16.921
- Hey. We caught a break.
- On the father?

18:17.008 --> 18:18.836
On the co-worker.
Rick Hughes.

18:18.923 --> 18:21.230
He's 22. He was seen harassing
Archie Bloom at work.

18:21.317 --> 18:22.753
He's got two strikes
for larceny.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.886
And check this out,
I found a disposable camera

18:24.973 --> 18:27.454
in Archie's locker
and had the film developed.

18:27.541 --> 18:29.020
[Lisbon]
'What was he stealing,
baby formula?'

18:29.108 --> 18:30.979
Yeah, it's a staple
in retail theft gangs

18:31.066 --> 18:32.502
always in demand
and way overpriced.

18:32.589 --> 18:33.764
Trust me. I know.

18:33.851 --> 18:35.810
If Archie was taking
surveillance photos

18:35.897 --> 18:37.986
he must've been planning
on exposing Hughes.

18:38.073 --> 18:39.596
A third strike would put Hughes
away for a long time.

18:39.683 --> 18:41.076
Well, that's a motive
for murder.

18:41.163 --> 18:42.556
Okay, bring him in,
but I'm gonna hold on

18:42.643 --> 18:44.210
to the kid's dad
for as long as I can.

18:44.297 --> 18:47.038
Okay.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.172
[knock on door]

18:53.567 --> 18:55.003
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

18:55.090 --> 18:58.441
The funeral director told me
I'd find you back here.

19:00.965 --> 19:03.490
Hello, Glennda.

19:06.275 --> 19:08.799
Peeking behind the curtain.

19:08.886 --> 19:10.975
Careful you don't lose
your illusions.

19:11.062 --> 19:12.238
Well, it's a little late
for that

19:12.325 --> 19:13.587
let me tell you.

19:13.674 --> 19:15.545
They prefer
I go by Glenn here

19:15.632 --> 19:17.895
and act like Glenn.

19:17.982 --> 19:20.811
A funeral cosmetologist.

19:20.898 --> 19:22.726
Well, that makes sense.

19:22.813 --> 19:26.339
Even a diva needs a day job.

19:26.426 --> 19:29.646
I've always loved makeup,
but, uh, wearing it

19:29.733 --> 19:32.301
'wasn't an option
for a boy in Sacramento'

19:32.388 --> 19:36.958
so, I Chose a career
in death care.

19:37.045 --> 19:39.134
What brings you
to my laboratory?

19:39.221 --> 19:43.443
I wanted to know why you lied
to me about the crime scene.

19:43.530 --> 19:45.009
And what makes you think
I lied?

19:45.096 --> 19:47.751
Well, I-I didn't at first.

19:47.838 --> 19:50.276
Uh, I cold-read you
as a man.

19:50.363 --> 19:52.321
I thought
your theatrical mannerisms

19:52.408 --> 19:55.019
were part of the character
you played.

19:55.106 --> 19:57.892
I underestimated the extent
of your transformation.

19:57.979 --> 20:00.024
3 hours of makeup
and a $4,000 dress

20:00.111 --> 20:01.591
has that effect.

20:01.678 --> 20:03.245
You become someone else.

20:03.332 --> 20:05.813
You become... a woman.

20:05.900 --> 20:10.078
Mm, and women often
act out a part

20:10.165 --> 20:11.819
uh, in the midst of deceit.

20:11.906 --> 20:16.389
They can be emotional
or coy or..

20:16.476 --> 20:18.086
...seductive.

20:18.173 --> 20:20.741
And I thought I had
gender issues.

20:20.828 --> 20:22.351
This is your last chance.

20:22.438 --> 20:25.267
I want the truth,
or I call my police friends

20:25.354 --> 20:27.269
and they'll lock you up.

20:27.356 --> 20:31.186
Glenn and Glennda,
both would be out of work.

20:31.273 --> 20:33.797
What'd you see
in that alley?

20:38.193 --> 20:42.806
A man holding a red gas can

20:42.893 --> 20:44.199
pouring it over a car.

20:44.286 --> 20:46.419
Was there anyone
inside the car?

20:46.506 --> 20:49.160
I don't know. It was dark.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.119
And what did this man
look like?

20:51.206 --> 20:53.295
Like I said, it was dark.

20:53.382 --> 20:55.863
You're playing dumb again.

20:55.950 --> 20:59.475
I am not playing.
I am scared.

20:59.562 --> 21:01.521
I have been a target
my whole life.

21:01.608 --> 21:04.567
I'm not gonna make myself
a target..

21:04.654 --> 21:07.135
...for a killer.

21:11.052 --> 21:12.488
Did you know
that Archie was on to you?

21:12.575 --> 21:14.490
- Yeah.
- When did he find out?

21:14.577 --> 21:16.971
Last week.
We were off-loading boxes

21:17.058 --> 21:18.929
and I heard something
by the dumpster.

21:19.016 --> 21:22.237
I looked inside, and it was
the little princess.

21:22.324 --> 21:24.500
- And what was he doing?
- Dumpster diving.

21:24.587 --> 21:26.023
Okay. For what?

21:26.110 --> 21:27.764
We throw away a lot
of junk.

21:27.851 --> 21:31.594
You know, busted chairs,
old magazines, dead plants.

21:31.681 --> 21:33.901
Archie said something about
needing to furnish his new room.

21:33.988 --> 21:35.424
And that's
when you assaulted him..

21:35.511 --> 21:37.165
Soon he wouldn't be able
to call the cops on you?

21:37.252 --> 21:39.080
I'll tell you the same thing
I told your cop buddy.

21:39.167 --> 21:41.300
I never laid afinger
on Archie!

21:41.387 --> 21:43.127
Although I did lock him
in that dumpster

21:43.214 --> 21:44.564
for a couple of hours.

21:44.651 --> 21:46.348

21:46.435 --> 21:48.176
What?

21:48.263 --> 21:50.004
Where were you
at 8:45 last night?

21:50.091 --> 21:52.223
In bed. I'm in bed
every night by that time.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.834
I work the 4:00 a.m. shift.

21:53.921 --> 21:56.315
So in other words,
you have no alibi.

21:56.402 --> 21:57.925
No alibi,
and your prints were found

21:58.012 --> 21:59.100
on the gas cans
at the murder scene..

21:59.187 --> 22:00.884
hey, wait a minute now.

22:00.971 --> 22:02.321
The gas cans that poured
accelerant onto the vehicle

22:02.408 --> 22:04.018
in which Archie Bloom
was burned alive.

22:04.105 --> 22:05.715
Of course my fingerprints
were on those cans.

22:05.802 --> 22:07.326
I personally stocked them
on the shelf!

22:07.413 --> 22:09.763
Or maybe you stole 'em,
like you stole this merchandise

22:09.850 --> 22:11.373
and you killed Archie
to avoid a third strike

22:11.460 --> 22:12.505

- Hey! Sit down!
- You hear me?!

22:16.073 --> 22:17.988
I want a lawyer!

22:18.075 --> 22:19.555
What do you think?

22:19.642 --> 22:21.427
Well, all cruelty stems
from weakness

22:21.514 --> 22:23.298
and this one's
a quivering mess

22:23.385 --> 22:27.302
emotionally immature,
aggressively masculine.

22:27.389 --> 22:28.912
He harbors childhood pain

22:28.999 --> 22:31.524
tied to bed-wetting
or some similar humiliation.

22:31.611 --> 22:33.221
Yeah, he could be
our killer, too.

22:33.308 --> 22:36.964
You're not making
this easy.

22:55.852 --> 22:57.593
How fast can you make it
to Glenbrook Park?

22:57.680 --> 22:59.116
It depends.
Is something wrong?

22:59.203 --> 23:02.293
Yes! It's a matter
of life and death.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.860
What's going on?
Who's in danger?

23:03.947 --> 23:07.168
The puppies!
There's this pet agency

23:07.255 --> 23:09.475
and, and, and, oh,
i-it's so sad

23:09.562 --> 23:11.477
a tragedy,
these, uh, poor animals.

23:11.564 --> 23:13.392
I mean, we are so lucky
to have homes.

23:13.479 --> 23:14.741
Can we talk about
this later?

23:14.828 --> 23:16.656
No! No, they're about
to pack up

23:16.743 --> 23:18.701
and I need to pick out
a puppy for you.

23:18.788 --> 23:20.137
Here.
Can I have this one, please?

23:20.224 --> 23:21.748
No, no. I don't,
I don't want a dog.

23:21.835 --> 23:24.272
Ohh! But you will
when you see this pug.

23:24.359 --> 23:26.143
No, I won't.

23:26.230 --> 23:29.320
He's just like you, Kimball.
He's all fierce on the outside

23:29.408 --> 23:30.931
and, like, a softy
on the inside

23:31.018 --> 23:35.065
and he's got
this really squishy little face.

23:35.152 --> 23:36.545
No, I gotta go. I gotta go.

23:36.632 --> 23:38.504
Whoa! Wait. Hey.

23:38.591 --> 23:40.810
- How about lunch?
- I'm working a case.

23:40.897 --> 23:43.378
Oh, that's perfect. We'll have
something to talk about.

23:43.465 --> 23:45.032
No, I have to find out
where our victim was living.

23:45.119 --> 23:46.686
I don't have time.

23:46.773 --> 23:48.427
Oh, come on, Kimball.
You have to eat.

23:48.514 --> 23:49.819
I'll spring for lunch.

23:49.906 --> 23:51.299
You guys owe me
a paycheck anyways.

23:51.386 --> 23:52.953
Look, I gotta go.
I'll see you tonight.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.998
Uh, no dogs.

23:57.348 --> 23:58.741
But I want one.

24:00.743 --> 24:02.658
The victim's last known address
is two miles away.

24:02.745 --> 24:04.965
As far as we know,
he has no friends.

24:05.052 --> 24:07.663
and he was one step away
from being homeless.

24:07.750 --> 24:11.014
Now I've been hitting
halfway houses all day.

24:11.101 --> 24:13.103

he might have crashed.

And your best one.

24:17.630 --> 24:18.892
You know him?

24:20.459 --> 24:21.938
It's Archie Bloom.

24:22.025 --> 24:23.244
You, uh..

24:25.464 --> 24:26.639
...you said he was murdered?

24:26.726 --> 24:28.075
Yeah.

24:30.643 --> 24:31.948
Take a minute.

24:34.734 --> 24:36.562
It's okay.
Um..

24:36.649 --> 24:37.606
[sighs]

24:40.000 --> 24:41.262
Let me show you his room.

24:47.486 --> 24:50.358
My name's Kelly.
I'm a counselor here.

24:50.445 --> 24:54.667
I was assigned to Archie
when he came to us last week.

24:54.754 --> 24:56.103
Would that be
when he left the bookstore

24:56.190 --> 24:58.235
where he was renting?

24:58.322 --> 24:59.976
Is that what Gabriel
told you?

25:00.063 --> 25:01.456
Archie was renting a room?

25:01.543 --> 25:02.979
That's right.

25:03.066 --> 25:04.459
Gabriel took in the boy

25:04.546 --> 25:06.156
because he was in love
with him.

25:06.243 --> 25:07.723
Only Gabriel's form of love

25:07.810 --> 25:10.900
involved bouts
of meth and violence.

25:10.987 --> 25:12.598
Here's his bed.

25:19.648 --> 25:21.911
Did Archie tell you
why he came here?

25:21.998 --> 25:23.826
He didn't want to come.

25:23.913 --> 25:25.654
he wanted to work it out
with Gabriel.

25:25.741 --> 25:27.830
Archie felt rejected
by his father

25:27.917 --> 25:31.138
so the acceptance of an
older male meant a lot to him.

25:31.225 --> 25:33.706
But Gabriel was a predator.

25:33.793 --> 25:35.359
That's how Archie got
the bruises.

25:35.446 --> 25:37.405
It was
an abusive relationship.

25:38.841 --> 25:40.495
It took a lot of courage

25:40.582 --> 25:44.804
but Archie left everything
at Gabriel's to join us.

25:44.891 --> 25:47.720
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

26:42.426 --> 26:44.211
- The lover.
- What lover?

26:44.298 --> 26:46.126
- He's a new suspect.
- Great. Just what I need.

take me to my client already?

to inconvenience my client..

been written without it.

to the murder of Archie Bloom.

27:25.382 --> 27:26.906
Why would I kill Archie?

27:26.993 --> 27:28.734
We read his journal.
We know all about it.

The physical and sexual abuse
driven by substance abuse.

27:31.214 --> 27:32.607
Crystal meth, to be exact.

27:32.694 --> 27:34.435
Archie's journal was
a writing project.

27:34.522 --> 27:36.002
It was a pure work
of fiction.

27:36.089 --> 27:37.307
Funny. That's not
what he told his counselor

27:37.394 --> 27:38.395

Fine. Keep your jacket on.

27:42.791 --> 27:44.271

27:57.458 --> 27:59.068

your high-minded talk

and a drug addict.

the police

28:06.380 --> 28:08.425
you killed him, just like
the journal said you would.

28:08.512 --> 28:10.210
I didn't.

- I don't get it.

you were provided.

Uncovered, not provided.

Semantics.

28:49.336 --> 28:51.120
Our best hope to nail the killer
is to leverage our evidence

28:51.207 --> 28:52.382
while they're still
in holding

28:52.469 --> 28:54.123
but which suspect do we
go after first?

Well, you have three
neatly packaged possibilities.

28:56.386 --> 28:58.084
Uh, the only way to know
for certain

28:58.171 --> 29:01.000
who killed Archie Bloom is
to convince the witness to talk.

30:53.547 --> 30:56.071
you know how to celebrate
what's different

30:56.158 --> 30:59.727
'and Archie Bloom was
different'

30:59.814 --> 31:03.470
and he was burned alive
for it.

31:07.604 --> 31:09.171
You have to go.

31:15.569 --> 31:17.179
Hmm.

31:18.180 --> 31:20.182
There you are.

31:22.750 --> 31:24.752
I brought this for you.

31:25.709 --> 31:27.886
Thanks.

31:27.973 --> 31:30.845
You aren't gonna eat it?

31:30.932 --> 31:32.586
- I'm not hungry.
- Oh.

31:32.673 --> 31:33.804
What are you doing here?

31:33.892 --> 31:36.024
I came to fill out
some paperwork.

31:36.111 --> 31:37.808
- A girl's gotta get paid.
- Right.

31:37.896 --> 31:41.421
Yeah, and...
I came to see you.

31:43.858 --> 31:46.817
- Hey, Summer.
- Hey, Teresa.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.645
Hi, boss.

31:50.560 --> 31:51.518
What is that about?

31:51.605 --> 31:53.085
Come here.

31:53.172 --> 31:55.261
Are you ashamed of me?

32:00.396 --> 32:03.095
I'm at work. She's my boss.
We need to be discreet.

32:03.182 --> 32:04.531
It's nothing personal.

32:04.618 --> 32:06.620
I get it.

32:06.707 --> 32:08.578
I just wish
we could be open

32:08.665 --> 32:10.145
like
boyfriend and girlfriend.

32:10.232 --> 32:12.539
We can,
if you stop being my C.I.

32:12.626 --> 32:14.933
I don't want to stop.
I need this job.

32:15.020 --> 32:17.848
The money's right,
and I like it.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.589
It's the first grown-up job
I've had.

32:19.676 --> 32:20.982
Alright then.

32:21.069 --> 32:22.766
No more fooling around
at work, okay?

32:22.853 --> 32:25.856
Yes, sir, Agent Cho.
On the double.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.294
Where's my money?

32:28.381 --> 32:31.558
Come on.

32:31.645 --> 32:35.257
[Lisbon]
'Number 3,
please step forward.'

32:35.344 --> 32:36.519
'What about him?'

32:36.606 --> 32:39.131
Take your time.

32:39.218 --> 32:42.395
Mm...
no, I don't think it's him.

32:42.482 --> 32:45.920
Thank you. Number four,
please step forward.

32:49.532 --> 32:52.796
Mnh-mnh. I'd remember him.
He's a brute.

32:52.883 --> 32:55.060
Thank you,
and, number five, your turn.

32:58.411 --> 33:01.762
You know him?

33:01.849 --> 33:05.113
That one definitely looks
familiar.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.028
Is he the man you saw
in the alley?

33:07.115 --> 33:08.377
Um...

33:09.770 --> 33:11.946
No, he, no, he's too big.

33:12.033 --> 33:16.690
All of them are too big.
The man that I saw was slender.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.171
Well, we tried.

33:19.258 --> 33:21.695
We did more than that.
We confirmed my suspicions.

33:21.782 --> 33:23.044
Glennda, come along.

33:23.131 --> 33:25.003
There's some people
I'd like you to meet.

33:30.095 --> 33:32.619
Uh, you two are free to go.

33:32.706 --> 33:35.926
These sad specimens are
the real suspects.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.190
Not any longer.
They're tainted.

33:38.277 --> 33:40.279
Jane, do you have any idea
what you've done?

33:40.366 --> 33:41.932
I haven't done anything,
but it's coming.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.543
Glennda,
meet the real suspects.

33:43.630 --> 33:46.459
Bachelor number one,
a serial bully and a thief.

33:46.546 --> 33:47.851
Is that a dude?

33:47.938 --> 33:50.071
Bachelor number two
owns his own bookstore.

33:50.158 --> 33:51.812
He's a drug-addicted sadist.

33:51.899 --> 33:54.032
Even the best dancer
in the world would look crazy

33:54.119 --> 33:55.511
to those who can't hear
the music.

33:55.598 --> 33:57.383
Who enjoys bad poetry.

33:57.470 --> 33:59.646
Which leaves us
with bachelor number three

33:59.733 --> 34:02.127
and the lowest life-form
of them all..

34:02.214 --> 34:05.260
a father that rejected
his own son.

34:05.347 --> 34:09.047
Thank you. You just made
my attorney's job much easier.

34:09.134 --> 34:11.701
All three of these suspects
are equally guilty

34:11.788 --> 34:14.313
for lighting the flames that
took the life of Archie Bloom.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.184
They can't all be the killer.

34:16.271 --> 34:18.665
Well, sure they can, because I
figured out who Glennda saw

34:18.752 --> 34:20.928
in that alleyway the night
the victim was murdered.

34:26.455 --> 34:30.503
Yes. Archie Bloom.

34:30.590 --> 34:33.027
The young man that doused
his own car with gas

34:33.114 --> 34:35.464
handcuffedhimself
to the steering wheel

34:35.551 --> 34:38.337
and then...
lit a match.

34:55.615 --> 34:57.095
If the victim took
his own life

34:57.182 --> 34:59.575
it exonerates my client
of guilt.

34:59.662 --> 35:03.666
- Uh, all of our clients.
- Guilt is a relative term.

35:03.753 --> 35:06.234
You three men drove a boy
to take his own life.

35:06.321 --> 35:07.627
But before he did,
he left clues

35:07.714 --> 35:08.802
to make each one of you
a suspect.

35:08.889 --> 35:10.586
What was the point?

35:10.673 --> 35:12.849
He had to know the evidence
would never stand up.

35:12.936 --> 35:14.764
Archie rigged it

35:14.851 --> 35:16.549
so that if your clients
didn't go down for murder,

35:16.636 --> 35:19.073
they'd each have to answer
for their other crimes.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.901
We're formally charging
Rick Hughes with theft

35:20.988 --> 35:22.598
Gabriel Lamb with drug dealing.

35:22.685 --> 35:25.688
- And Archie Bloom--
- Will walk. I guarantee it.

35:25.775 --> 35:27.212
Where is he going?

35:27.299 --> 35:29.431
Your client handcuffed
his gay son to a desk.

35:29.518 --> 35:31.085
Wait till that video gets out.

35:31.172 --> 35:33.087
[Lisbon]
'You're never gonna
work again.'

35:33.174 --> 35:35.263
It's just a shame a boy
had to take his own life

35:35.350 --> 35:38.179
to bring each of you
to justice.

35:38.266 --> 35:40.921
'Carl, get 'em out of here.'

35:41.008 --> 35:43.532
Such a nice face.

35:43.619 --> 35:46.927
Why did he Choose our alley
to end his life?

35:47.014 --> 35:50.060
Sometimes a dark alley
is just a dark alley.

36:05.032 --> 36:07.208
Well...
they've all been processed.

36:07.295 --> 36:09.079
Well,
that's a big haul today.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.343
Solved a murder.
You booked three scumbags

36:11.430 --> 36:14.781
as you coppers like to say.
You should be very proud.

36:14.868 --> 36:17.827
I don't think I've ever been
so depressed about a case.

36:17.914 --> 36:21.527
I can't get that kid out
of my head.

36:21.614 --> 36:23.616
You want some tea?

36:23.703 --> 36:25.444
I don't think
tea's gonna do it.

36:25.531 --> 36:27.881
Hmm.

36:27.968 --> 36:30.362
in that case,
I think I know just the thing

36:30.449 --> 36:33.452
to cheer you up...
cabaret.

36:33.539 --> 36:35.018
Jane.

36:35.105 --> 36:36.629
And if hurry,
we can catch the late show.

36:36.716 --> 36:38.108
Come on. I need to get
flowers on the way.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.980
Mmm.

36:40.067 --> 36:41.024
[dishes clatter]

36:41.111 --> 36:42.330
Come on.

36:46.073 --> 36:47.335
[upbeat music]

37:06.049 --> 37:07.790
Oh. Now who died?

37:07.877 --> 37:12.099
Don't mind us. We come bearing
well wishes and flowers.

37:12.186 --> 37:15.668
Ah. Fifi Nix.

37:15.755 --> 37:17.365
This is, uh, Teresa Lisbon.

37:17.452 --> 37:19.062
Fifi. These are for you.

37:19.149 --> 37:21.108
I just want to wish you luck
with your new life.

37:21.195 --> 37:24.416
- You deserve the best.
- What new life?

37:24.503 --> 37:26.287
Are you gonna tell her,
or shall I?

37:26.374 --> 37:27.506
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

37:27.593 --> 37:29.290
Such modesty.

37:29.377 --> 37:31.379
Actually, I'm quite surprised
you hadn't picked it up.

37:31.466 --> 37:32.772
Fifi Nix.

37:32.859 --> 37:37.385
'Phoenix.
Risen from the ashes.'

37:38.865 --> 37:40.954
Fifi Nix is Archie Bloom?

37:47.003 --> 37:48.266
That's right. I was.

37:48.353 --> 37:49.745
Uh, Archie, I mean.

37:49.832 --> 37:51.617
The suicide was staged?

37:51.704 --> 37:55.011
Not at first.
It was gonna be real.

37:55.098 --> 37:56.012
They talked me out of it.

37:59.146 --> 38:01.017
Where did you get
the body?

38:01.104 --> 38:02.236
[chuckles]
Well, here's hoping

38:02.323 --> 38:04.325
I look good
in prison orange.

38:04.412 --> 38:08.460
I stole an unclaimed body
from the cemetery where I work.

38:08.547 --> 38:10.592
It was destined
for the potter's field.

38:10.679 --> 38:13.682
[clicks]

38:13.769 --> 38:15.641
Watch the head.

38:15.728 --> 38:17.338
- Whoa, whoa.
- Drop it down.

38:18.774 --> 38:20.080
'Oh!'

38:40.753 --> 38:43.799
'Come on.
Come on.'

38:43.886 --> 38:45.105

38:45.192 --> 38:47.020
Come on. Keep going.
Keep going.

38:47.107 --> 38:48.761
And what about
the dental records?

38:48.848 --> 38:50.197
Well, Miss Frita People
over there

38:50.284 --> 38:52.765
happens to be a dentist
during the day.

38:52.852 --> 38:54.506
Archie's dentist.

38:54.593 --> 38:57.813
Uh, I X-rayed the corpse
and supplied your department

38:57.900 --> 38:59.162
with the film.

38:59.249 --> 39:01.339
That's how I met everyone.

39:01.426 --> 39:03.297
Last year,
I was getting a checkup.

39:03.384 --> 39:07.519
I noticed traces
of eyeliner on my dentist.

39:07.606 --> 39:09.521
he introduced me around.

39:09.608 --> 39:11.697
So you were all in on it?

39:11.784 --> 39:14.047
We're suckers for heartache.

39:14.134 --> 39:18.399
And that's why I lied about
what I saw in the alley.

39:18.486 --> 39:20.227
She lied to protect us.

39:20.314 --> 39:22.011
How did you know it was me?

39:22.098 --> 39:23.839
Well, you're exactly what
I expected to find

39:23.926 --> 39:27.930
I mean, uh, aside from
a little paint and bodywork.

39:28.017 --> 39:30.759
What did you expect
to find?

39:30.846 --> 39:34.546
The victim we were investigating
wasn't someone preparing to die.

39:34.633 --> 39:35.982
It was someone that wanted
to live.

39:40.856 --> 39:42.945
So what are you going
to do?

39:43.032 --> 39:45.774
Yes, uh,
whatarewe going to do?
