WEBVTT

00:44.461 --> 00:47.380
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

01:05.231 --> 01:07.108
YEAR 1987

01:25.210 --> 01:26.294
What is that?

01:26.377 --> 01:27.796
Do you remember

01:28.880 --> 01:31.466
the videotape that you and your friends

01:32.217 --> 01:33.718
watched a few days ago?

01:34.886 --> 01:35.887
Yes.

01:35.970 --> 01:39.307
Then go and play this tape to them.

01:46.147 --> 01:47.899
All right. It's time to go to school.

01:48.483 --> 01:49.526
What will happen?

01:55.281 --> 01:56.908
What will happen to

01:59.285 --> 02:00.870
the magazine club members

02:01.913 --> 02:03.331
after they listen to this?

02:44.789 --> 02:46.499
I can't open the door.

02:46.583 --> 02:47.959
What now? Break it open.

02:48.042 --> 02:48.918
Hey, Jung-hyun.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.045
Jung-hyun.

02:52.630 --> 02:53.756
Why won't it open?

02:54.799 --> 02:55.758
Hey Jung-hyun.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.068
Hi Yong-tak.

03:16.154 --> 03:17.447
Oh, hi.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.699
-Where are the others?
-I think they're not here yet.

03:25.288 --> 03:28.041
Is your hand okay?

03:29.834 --> 03:30.835
Yes.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.128
It's just a scratch.

03:33.546 --> 03:34.547
Really?

03:38.259 --> 03:39.344
Yong-tak.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.057
You know…

03:45.725 --> 03:49.270
I don't know why

03:50.146 --> 03:51.814
I acted like that today.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.734
I had brain fog the entire day.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.028
When I came to my senses,

03:57.111 --> 03:59.322
I found myself
sitting in the broadcasting room.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.242
Jung-hyun. It's all right.

04:03.284 --> 04:04.702
You don't have to explain it.

04:07.455 --> 04:09.958
I couldn't focus either the whole day.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.794
I don't remember what I did at school.

04:14.629 --> 04:18.091
We have some kind of
telepathic connection, don't you think?

04:24.013 --> 04:25.431
We came on time.

04:35.024 --> 04:37.735
Too bad Kyung-joo couldn't come
because she's sick.

04:37.819 --> 04:40.113
I know. Wish she could see this with us.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.031
See what?

04:43.116 --> 04:44.409
You'll find out when we get there.

04:45.118 --> 04:49.122
Min-jae and I met this amazing person
a few days ago.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.959
He said that
he'd show us something really cool

04:53.042 --> 04:54.836
if we came here tonight.

04:55.586 --> 04:56.796
Right, Min-jae?

04:57.922 --> 04:59.048
This is it.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.218
We can hide here.

05:03.094 --> 05:04.262
Hide?

05:05.305 --> 05:06.431
What for?

05:07.265 --> 05:09.183
-You'll see.
-You want to die?

05:09.267 --> 05:10.518
Don't touch me!

05:10.601 --> 05:12.687
I was annoyed all day today.

05:12.770 --> 05:15.023
Don't play games with me. Okay?

05:15.106 --> 05:17.483
Yong-tak, don't be like that.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.111
Be quiet. It's coming out.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.413
I don't see anything.

05:31.873 --> 05:34.250
Over there. You don't see it?

05:59.025 --> 06:00.777
I'm not seeing anything.

06:07.408 --> 06:08.493
Yong-tak.

06:14.165 --> 06:15.374
It's real.

06:19.295 --> 06:21.214
He wasn't lying.

06:22.548 --> 06:24.592
-Jung-hyun.
-Yong-tak, do you see something?

06:25.259 --> 06:26.427
What's out there?

06:43.444 --> 06:44.362
Run.

06:45.154 --> 06:46.239
Yong-tak.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.347
Hey. Send it to me after you check it!

08:04.859 --> 08:06.736
YEAR 1987

08:16.871 --> 08:18.956
It can't be true. It's not real.

08:30.635 --> 08:31.886
I have to stay still.

08:32.803 --> 08:35.431
Whatever happens, I have to stay still.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.381
You were able to see the woman.

09:10.967 --> 09:12.677
Then you're ready.

10:25.583 --> 10:26.709
Mom.

10:27.418 --> 10:30.254
It's going to be all over soon.

10:45.227 --> 10:47.146
Moon-sook! Oh my gosh.

10:47.229 --> 10:48.522
What on earth has happened?

10:49.273 --> 10:50.900
Are you okay?

10:50.983 --> 10:53.319
Yes, I'm all right.

10:53.986 --> 10:56.906
But Aunt is probably in shock.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.532
Oh my goodness.

10:58.616 --> 10:59.742
Where is she?

11:00.409 --> 11:01.619
Where is Jung-hyun?

11:02.370 --> 11:03.537
She's sitting over there.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.123
Where? Moon-sook.

11:06.749 --> 11:09.919
She was sitting right there a minute ago.

11:10.461 --> 11:11.462
That's weird.

11:12.546 --> 11:13.839
Jung-hyun.

11:16.801 --> 11:17.927
Jung-hyun.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.054
Where are you?

11:28.813 --> 11:31.273
YOUNGJIN BRAIN STUDY SCIENCE VIDEO

12:17.027 --> 12:18.195
Damn it. What the?

12:18.279 --> 12:19.280
Hey.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.326
-Hey!
-Hey, stop.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.329
October 6,
Cheonyang Water Purification Plant.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.882
Could you put out your hand?

14:20.818 --> 14:23.320
Will I die?

14:25.948 --> 14:27.157
Not yet.

14:29.368 --> 14:32.037
You'll be helping me tomorrow.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.583
It won't just be you.

14:35.666 --> 14:39.169
All of the magazine club members
who saw the video will help me.

14:40.504 --> 14:41.589
What

14:42.381 --> 14:44.008
are we supposed to do?

14:44.758 --> 14:47.011
I'm going to give you a briefcase.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.930
You'll go to Saju Station
with that briefcase.

14:51.807 --> 14:53.559
Then you'll open the briefcase.

14:55.269 --> 14:57.187
And then release the gas.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.065
Is that…

15:01.066 --> 15:02.192
Is that it?

15:02.985 --> 15:04.028
No.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.740
It's the beginning.

15:39.229 --> 15:41.148
Stay still, okay?

15:42.733 --> 15:44.652
I'll untie you after I'm done talking.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.239
There was no need to resort to violence.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.908
We could talk it out.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.078
You're just making things complicated.

15:54.745 --> 15:56.163
You're the friend.

15:57.498 --> 16:00.584
Jung Min-jae.
Jung-hyun's old high school friend.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.044
So you are a cop.

16:02.836 --> 16:04.463
You were able to recognize me.

16:05.255 --> 16:09.093
But knowing who I am doesn't matter.

16:12.179 --> 16:16.558
I'm just a worker ant
who serves and follows him.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.144
Him?

16:19.228 --> 16:22.898
I got this job after finishing high school
because he told me to.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.818
I did it to prepare for this very moment.

16:27.319 --> 16:31.532
You could say I spent
half of my life serving him with loyalty.

16:32.366 --> 16:34.201
Are you talking about Jo Kyung-ho?

16:36.996 --> 16:40.958
I don't just say his name
whenever I feel like it.

16:43.293 --> 16:44.712
I don't understand.

16:48.298 --> 16:49.675
What do you not understand?

16:50.300 --> 16:51.677
Why would someone like you

16:52.594 --> 16:54.638
help a terrorist like him?

16:54.722 --> 16:56.890
-What's your reason?
-Detective Choi.

16:57.474 --> 16:59.435
I'm an ordinary person.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.981
I have cluttered thoughts,
get jealous, and I have regrets too.

17:04.064 --> 17:06.025
I'm as ordinary as anyone can be.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.988
But what about him?

17:12.156 --> 17:13.407
He's different.

17:14.074 --> 17:16.035
He has a vision.

17:16.785 --> 17:18.787
And he has the power
to realize his vision.

17:19.913 --> 17:22.875
I'm just a mere person.
What's wrong with offering a little help

17:22.958 --> 17:26.503
to a person who possesses such a vision?

17:27.129 --> 17:28.338
Don't you agree?

17:32.676 --> 17:35.471
All of you cult members
say the same thing.

17:36.388 --> 17:38.098
You're airheads.

17:38.807 --> 17:41.226
And because he has filled your heads
with his ideas,

17:42.186 --> 17:45.355
you think you've stumbled upon
some great insight.

17:46.607 --> 17:49.526
So you won't accept our beliefs.

17:56.158 --> 17:58.410
Well, it doesn't matter.

17:59.536 --> 18:02.956
Because you'll be enlightened soon.

18:09.046 --> 18:11.757
He's ready. I'll put him on.

18:17.888 --> 18:19.640
The call is for you, Detective.

18:24.311 --> 18:25.854
<i>Hello?</i>

18:26.855 --> 18:28.232
<i>This is Jo Kyung-ho.</i>

18:30.567 --> 18:32.903
<i>How have you been, Detective Choi?</i>

18:34.071 --> 18:35.572
<i>How did you know</i>

18:36.281 --> 18:37.616
<i>I would come here?</i>

18:39.076 --> 18:41.078
<i>Did you order people to watch me?</i>

18:41.578 --> 18:42.746
Watch you?

18:44.164 --> 18:45.999
No, I didn't.

18:46.667 --> 18:47.918
I've been

18:48.877 --> 18:51.255
waiting for you for a long time.

18:52.714 --> 18:55.884
Because you and I must meet.

18:55.968 --> 18:56.927
<i>But</i>

18:57.553 --> 19:01.098
<i>I realized something when I first saw you.</i>

19:02.266 --> 19:05.102
<i>You absolutely knew nothing.</i>

19:05.894 --> 19:06.854
What?

19:06.937 --> 19:08.939
<i>So I thought it was impossible.</i>

19:10.482 --> 19:13.819
<i>A foolish person like you
can never come with us</i>

19:14.653 --> 19:18.031
<i>to the end of the future.</i>

19:19.867 --> 19:21.368
The end of the future?

19:22.286 --> 19:24.037
What kind of nonsense is that?

19:24.121 --> 19:26.248
<i>I can't tell you about it yet.</i>

19:27.332 --> 19:30.460
<i>If we're going to have
a real conversation,</i>

19:31.253 --> 19:33.922
<i>you'll have to give me
the answer I want to hear.</i>

19:34.006 --> 19:35.215
You're a lunatic.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.634
You think we'll ever sit down

19:37.718 --> 19:40.220
together on a couch
and have a friendly conversation?

19:40.304 --> 19:41.305
In fact,

19:42.097 --> 19:45.184
I will shoot your head
before that ever happens.

19:47.102 --> 19:48.312
That's interesting.

19:49.104 --> 19:50.647
This "end of the future" plan of yours…

19:51.648 --> 19:53.734
Do whatever you want to make it happen.

19:53.817 --> 19:55.319
<i>I'm not going to hide from you.</i>

19:56.737 --> 20:00.365
<i>I don't care if you have
people watching over me or not.</i>

20:01.158 --> 20:02.993
Everything you say is worthless crap.

20:06.496 --> 20:10.083
Your cult has been recently handing out
strange videotapes to people, right?

20:10.918 --> 20:14.254
<i>In the videotape, there's footage
from the One Family Welfare Center.</i>

20:15.631 --> 20:17.299
I realized something when I saw it.

20:18.091 --> 20:19.843
This Jo Kyung-ho bastard

20:21.762 --> 20:24.306
wants to get revenge on the whole town.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.809
<i>You blame the people of Saju</i>

20:28.602 --> 20:29.895
<i>for the hellish experience you had</i>

20:30.896 --> 20:35.400
at the welfare center
because they knew what was going on there

20:36.151 --> 20:38.362
but did nothing about it.

20:38.987 --> 20:41.073
<i>So that's why you want
to kill them all, right?</i>

20:41.990 --> 20:43.492
You justify your actions

20:44.243 --> 20:46.119
because you were victimized long ago.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.335
Anything more to say?

20:55.921 --> 20:58.507
<i>I'm impressed, Mr. Choi Hyung-in.
Yes, indeed.</i>

20:58.590 --> 21:01.009
<i>You did far better than I expected.
I'm surprised.</i>

21:01.635 --> 21:04.221
But that's not the answer
I want to hear from you.

21:05.555 --> 21:06.974
This story begins

21:08.684 --> 21:12.020
with the One Family Welfare Center.
You got that part right.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.189
But the story ends with you.

21:14.940 --> 21:17.276
<i>What happens today</i>

21:17.359 --> 21:19.486
will merely be a symbolic gesture.

21:19.569 --> 21:22.614
<i>You can't change the predetermined future.</i>

21:22.698 --> 21:25.200
<i>Just focus on that.</i>

21:26.493 --> 21:29.579
Everything else is meaningless.

21:30.831 --> 21:33.583
<i>Watch what is going to happen soon.</i>

21:34.251 --> 21:35.210
<i>And</i>

21:35.294 --> 21:39.172
accept the fact that
you can't change anything.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.259
<i>All right. Mr. Choi Hyung-in.</i>

21:44.428 --> 21:46.179
Have a pleasant trip.

21:59.484 --> 22:00.569
All right.

22:01.236 --> 22:04.698
Now let's get started.

22:07.200 --> 22:08.368
At midnight.

22:09.119 --> 22:12.247
When it's exactly October 6,

22:13.790 --> 22:15.751
the attack that happened

22:16.460 --> 22:19.546
at Saju Station in 1987 will be recreated.

23:15.769 --> 23:20.232
All the people who saw the video
will gather here.

23:21.233 --> 23:24.611
And they will go towards
the predetermined future.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.366
They're following Guru's vision.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.786
I've been given an important mission
to carry out.

23:42.420 --> 23:44.214
You're going to

23:45.757 --> 23:48.135
kill all those people?

23:48.718 --> 23:50.137
Why the hell would you do that?

23:50.804 --> 23:52.430
Why would you do such a crazy act?

23:52.514 --> 23:53.849
I already told you!

23:54.641 --> 23:58.061
You still don't understand
his vision, Detective Choi.

23:58.145 --> 24:00.939
So just shut up

24:01.022 --> 24:03.358
and watch what happens before your eyes.

24:05.026 --> 24:06.862
It's a new dawn in history.

24:27.048 --> 24:29.509
Wow. It's really happening like you said.

24:30.677 --> 24:32.846
They're coming like a plague of rats.

24:34.222 --> 24:37.350
Of course, it's real.
You thought it was fake?

24:39.644 --> 24:42.147
That's why I have my work cut out for me.

24:42.981 --> 24:45.275
Because he wields real power.

24:46.234 --> 24:48.820
It's a tragedy, you know.

24:51.031 --> 24:53.950
All right. Let's get ready now.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.984
OCTOBER 6, 1999
CHEONYANG WATER PURIFICATION PLANT

25:33.281 --> 25:36.868
Why did they have to gas him like that?
They could have just brought him.

25:36.952 --> 25:38.245
It's so troublesome.

25:41.456 --> 25:43.500
He might die before this is over.

25:50.924 --> 25:52.550
What? What did you say?

26:01.017 --> 26:02.769
What are you muttering?

26:10.235 --> 26:11.945
Is it cold in there?

26:13.154 --> 26:14.698
Or is it warm?

26:16.074 --> 26:17.367
What?

26:17.450 --> 26:19.619
You probably know because you work here.

26:23.790 --> 26:25.709
What are you trying to say?

26:27.711 --> 26:28.837
All right.

26:29.879 --> 26:31.965
I hate water.

26:32.966 --> 26:33.883
Water?

26:35.176 --> 26:36.428
Yes, water.

26:48.315 --> 26:49.482
How about it?

26:51.109 --> 26:52.777
I finished warming up.

27:57.175 --> 27:58.843
I'm sick and tired of this.

28:00.136 --> 28:01.930
The thick, heavy air.

28:02.013 --> 28:03.390
The smell of the water.

28:03.473 --> 28:04.432
Especially

28:04.516 --> 28:08.728
the sound of the dripping water
that never ceases.

28:08.812 --> 28:10.814
Seriously,

28:11.481 --> 28:14.067
I'm just so sick and tired of it.

28:16.820 --> 28:20.031
I'm going to finish this mission

28:20.824 --> 28:21.908
no matter what.

29:33.188 --> 29:35.106
You came, Jung-hyun.

29:38.234 --> 29:39.402
Min-jae.

29:41.404 --> 29:42.781
What are you doing?

29:44.741 --> 29:46.534
And why are there people outside?

29:49.370 --> 29:52.499
Explain yourself, Min-jae.
What the heck is going on with you?

29:53.708 --> 29:54.667
Jung-hyun,

29:55.627 --> 29:56.753
stop it.

29:57.337 --> 30:00.799
Young-seob and I have been members of
the Youngjin sect for a long time.

30:00.882 --> 30:02.717
You knew about it, didn't you?

30:02.801 --> 30:03.885
No, I didn't.

30:05.678 --> 30:07.847
Yong-tak and I trusted you.

30:09.265 --> 30:11.559
We didn't think you were one of them.

30:12.393 --> 30:13.520
Yong-tak

30:14.729 --> 30:16.523
believed in you till the very end.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.484
But today, Yong-tak…

30:26.616 --> 30:27.575
Did you

30:30.411 --> 30:32.038
already know he was dead?

30:33.498 --> 30:34.457
Yes.

30:35.166 --> 30:39.337
One of my missions was to keep
a close eye on you and Yong-tak.

30:39.420 --> 30:42.590
Then it was you who helped Kyung-ho

30:44.342 --> 30:45.802
communicate with Jae-young?

30:56.271 --> 30:58.857
Yes, that was me.

31:02.402 --> 31:04.070
But you know, Jung-hyun.

31:05.071 --> 31:09.033
In the big scheme of things,
it's not a big deal at all.

31:09.659 --> 31:11.536
It's a trivial matter.

31:13.538 --> 31:16.207
-A trivial matter?
-Yes. Look at the big picture.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.918
All of those things are trivial matters.

31:19.002 --> 31:20.378
You don't get it?

31:21.629 --> 31:23.172
Jae-young's kidnapping

31:23.882 --> 31:25.508
and Yong-tak's death

31:26.593 --> 31:27.969
are trivial matters to you?

31:34.100 --> 31:35.018
In 1987,

31:36.853 --> 31:38.813
when we went to Cheonyang Lake,

31:41.941 --> 31:43.735
we left you behind while we ran away.

31:45.612 --> 31:48.531
Things might have turned out differently

31:49.657 --> 31:51.701
had we not left you behind that night.

31:53.077 --> 31:54.370
That's why…

31:56.205 --> 31:58.458
I can't blame you.

32:04.088 --> 32:04.964
No.

32:06.174 --> 32:07.383
You're mistaken.

32:08.509 --> 32:10.470
You didn't leave me behind.

32:11.095 --> 32:13.640
I was waiting there for him.

32:14.349 --> 32:16.935
I waited for Guru all by myself.

32:18.144 --> 32:19.604
-What?
-I've never met anyone

32:19.687 --> 32:21.314
like Guru in my life before.

32:22.440 --> 32:25.026
When I couldn't pay
for my mom's medical treatment

32:25.818 --> 32:28.321
when she was on the brink of death,

32:28.404 --> 32:32.617
Guru was the only person
who cared and lent me a hand.

32:36.454 --> 32:38.456
I'm different from Yong-tak
and Young-seob.

32:39.082 --> 32:43.962
They don't remember what they did
at Saju Station that day.

32:45.296 --> 32:47.507
Unlike them, I started
from a different place.

32:50.093 --> 32:51.260
I thought

32:52.470 --> 32:56.724
everything would be okay
if I could save my mom and myself

32:58.518 --> 33:01.479
by killing those innocent people
at Saju Station.

33:02.105 --> 33:03.773
That's the kind of person I am.

33:10.196 --> 33:11.990
I'm done talking now, Jung-hyun.

33:12.073 --> 33:15.326
Even though you're a friend,
I'll kill you if you try to stop me.

33:15.410 --> 33:18.079
Min-jae, let's start over again. Okay?

33:18.162 --> 33:18.997
Min-jae.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.207
I've been waiting for this day
for so long.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.793
To finally get to this point,

33:23.876 --> 33:27.296
I endured years of boredom
and joyless existence.

33:30.591 --> 33:33.219
-Stop it!
-Let go of it!

33:37.515 --> 33:39.726
Do you really want to die?

33:45.898 --> 33:47.191
I said let go!

33:59.287 --> 34:00.288
Min-jae.

34:02.623 --> 34:04.751
No. Min-jae!

34:10.048 --> 34:12.008
Min-jae!

34:13.593 --> 34:16.095
Min-jae, listen to me. Min-jae!

34:17.013 --> 34:18.306
No, Min-jae!

34:19.140 --> 34:20.808
Min-jae, open the door!

34:22.894 --> 34:24.062
Min-jae!

34:26.189 --> 34:27.315
Min-jae!

34:27.398 --> 34:28.691
Disciple Choi,

34:29.317 --> 34:30.693
it's me.

34:32.361 --> 34:35.448
Yes, everything is in place.

34:38.201 --> 34:41.412
Is my mom sleeping soundly?

34:42.330 --> 34:45.333
I'm a little worried because
I left her bedside at the hospital.

34:45.416 --> 34:46.459
Yes.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.629
She's sleeping soundly.

34:49.712 --> 34:50.713
<i>Okay.</i>

34:51.672 --> 34:53.132
<i>That's a relief to hear.</i>

34:53.216 --> 34:54.300
Master,

34:55.259 --> 34:57.053
we don't have time.

34:58.346 --> 35:01.724
I'm just waiting for you
to give me the order.

35:09.565 --> 35:10.566
Min-jae.

35:11.400 --> 35:12.860
Min-jae, open the door.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.071
All right.

35:16.823 --> 35:17.907
Disciple.

35:20.034 --> 35:21.410
Help my mother…

35:24.455 --> 35:26.290
reach the new future.

35:27.083 --> 35:28.584
Please…

35:35.550 --> 35:36.717
Min-jae!

35:37.510 --> 35:38.886
Min-jae!

35:38.970 --> 35:41.180
Min-jae, listen to me.

35:41.264 --> 35:42.515
Min-jae.

35:42.598 --> 35:43.683
Jung-hyun.

35:44.809 --> 35:47.645
I'm so exhausted.

36:00.700 --> 36:01.784
No, Min-jae.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.161
I'm sorry.

36:04.203 --> 36:05.329
Mom…

36:06.122 --> 36:07.039
Min-jae…

37:53.437 --> 37:54.647
Min-jae.

37:56.148 --> 37:57.233
Don't…

38:02.822 --> 38:05.908
ever forgive me.

38:25.094 --> 38:28.597
We have to turn that sound off quickly.

38:52.371 --> 38:54.623
No matter what I do, I can't make it stop.

38:58.753 --> 39:00.254
Please stop.

39:02.798 --> 39:04.050
Please!

39:23.319 --> 39:24.653
Hold on a minute.

39:26.113 --> 39:27.531
I'll go up.

39:45.591 --> 39:46.884
We got played

39:48.135 --> 39:49.595
by that bastard again.

39:50.888 --> 39:52.723
That bastard, Jo Kyung-ho knew

39:53.599 --> 39:55.726
how this would unfold all along.

40:09.365 --> 40:10.574
Stop!

40:24.755 --> 40:26.048
Let's go.

40:26.757 --> 40:28.676
Will you, sir?

40:29.427 --> 40:31.679
Won't you wait for the call
to hear the result?

40:31.762 --> 40:34.640
It's unnecessary.
I already know how it'll end.

40:37.393 --> 40:38.644
By the way,

40:40.229 --> 40:44.608
I hope you won't say a word
about what you saw and heard today.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.277
Of course, Guru.

40:47.027 --> 40:49.989
I wasn't going to tell anyone
even if you hadn't told me not to.

40:51.115 --> 40:52.199
Okay.

40:56.203 --> 40:58.038
Everyone is an obedient worker ant.

41:19.518 --> 41:21.604
Jung-hyun, move out of the way.

41:29.278 --> 41:30.529
It's useless, Detective.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.168
Stop it.

41:48.464 --> 41:50.549
You might collapse, Detective Choi.

41:54.136 --> 41:55.137
I know

41:55.804 --> 41:59.350
what that creepy sound is.

42:02.853 --> 42:04.688
Whoever watched the videotape

42:05.731 --> 42:07.566
won't survive

42:09.443 --> 42:11.195
after they hear that sound.

42:13.739 --> 42:15.074
I'll sacrifice my life.

42:16.075 --> 42:17.826
I'll be the last and only person

42:19.119 --> 42:20.412
Jo Kyung-ho

42:21.539 --> 42:23.541
ends up killing in this town.

42:24.291 --> 42:25.543
Let go of me.

42:26.085 --> 42:27.461
Get out of my way.

43:08.085 --> 43:09.253
Watch out!

44:28.082 --> 44:31.251
-Move it!
-What's going on?

44:32.544 --> 44:34.380
-What am I doing here?
-What the hell?

44:34.463 --> 44:36.799
-Where am I?
-What is this place?

44:36.882 --> 44:38.425
-Get rid of that!
-Yes, sir!

45:21.468 --> 45:22.761
How…

45:23.554 --> 45:25.305
How could you be here?

45:28.267 --> 45:29.601
What is this?

45:34.064 --> 45:35.649
I can't breathe…

46:10.767 --> 46:12.227
What's your question?

46:12.978 --> 46:14.104
Who am I?

46:14.771 --> 46:17.524
Or am I Guru?

46:18.734 --> 46:19.902
Who are you?

46:21.778 --> 46:23.030
Who are you?

46:23.614 --> 46:24.698
I…

46:27.034 --> 46:28.911
came to save you.

46:37.002 --> 46:39.379
Who are you?

46:42.508 --> 46:44.468
It's time to sleep.

46:58.357 --> 46:59.858
Your time isn't over yet.

47:01.151 --> 47:02.402
I need

47:03.862 --> 47:05.864
both of you.

47:33.183 --> 47:34.518
Hello.

47:38.188 --> 47:39.147
Who are you?

47:39.731 --> 47:41.483
I'm Kim Moon-sook.

47:42.067 --> 47:44.194
-Kim Moon-sook?
-Yes.

47:46.363 --> 47:47.406
Okay.

47:48.657 --> 47:50.659
I don't know what's going on.

47:58.875 --> 47:59.960
Yes? Aunt.

48:01.128 --> 48:02.671
I had some snacks.

48:03.463 --> 48:04.965
I also drank some juice.

48:05.841 --> 48:08.385
Don't worry. I brought
a lot of comic books to read.

48:10.137 --> 48:13.181
And you know, Aunt.

48:14.516 --> 48:16.310
The man…

48:17.769 --> 48:19.104
Yes, the detective.

48:19.980 --> 48:21.481
He's awake now.

48:23.317 --> 48:24.359
What?

48:25.652 --> 48:26.695
Okay.

48:28.196 --> 48:29.448
Okay, Aunt.

48:35.495 --> 48:38.248
That was Jae-young's aunt.
She's coming right now.

48:39.041 --> 48:41.335
She told me to call a nurse for you.

48:41.918 --> 48:43.086
She sounded very surprised.

48:43.170 --> 48:45.380
Surprised? Why?

48:46.673 --> 48:47.716
Well…

48:48.467 --> 48:50.761
You were in a coma for over a week.

48:51.470 --> 48:55.349
Seung-hyun thought you were dead
and cried all day the other day.

49:01.605 --> 49:04.066
Do you want some chewing gum?

49:13.700 --> 49:15.535
<i>After special investigators analyzed</i>

49:15.619 --> 49:19.498
<i>the evidence found at the scene
and in the homes of the deceased,</i>

49:19.581 --> 49:21.291
<i>they have concluded</i>

49:21.375 --> 49:24.628
<i>that the 200 dead people and more
were followers of the Youngjin sect.</i>

49:24.711 --> 49:27.130
<i>They also announced that
after the cult members carried out</i>

49:27.214 --> 49:29.132
<i>a religious rite
inside the water purification plant,</i>

49:29.216 --> 49:32.052
<i>they tried to commit mass suicide
by inhaling nerve gas.</i>

49:32.135 --> 49:36.348
<i>A plant worker called Jung Min-jae</i>

49:36.431 --> 49:40.143
<i>who was found dead in her office </i>

49:40.227 --> 49:43.689
<i>is said to have overseen the operation.</i>

49:43.772 --> 49:47.067
<i>Special investigators
are conducting a manhunt</i>

49:47.150 --> 49:49.778
<i>to find the cult leader of Youngjin sect,
Jung Young-seob,</i>

49:49.861 --> 49:52.864
<i>who is the alleged mastermind
behind the mass suicide.</i>

49:52.948 --> 49:56.868
<i>At the same time, high-ranking
cult members are also being sought…</i>

50:02.165 --> 50:04.668
I don't think we could have
stopped this from happening

50:05.544 --> 50:07.421
if the people who received the videotape

50:08.296 --> 50:12.467
were all cult members
of the Youngjin sect.

50:14.720 --> 50:16.012
This is so funny.

50:17.556 --> 50:18.807
Whatever.

50:20.100 --> 50:21.476
They're Jae-young's friends.

50:21.977 --> 50:23.645
When I couldn't be here,

50:24.271 --> 50:26.398
they stayed by your bedside.

50:27.149 --> 50:28.275
I see.

50:28.358 --> 50:29.985
That's funny.

50:30.068 --> 50:32.112
Thank you for being so kind.

50:32.696 --> 50:34.448
Don't mention it.
It's the least I could do.

50:34.531 --> 50:35.532
Did

50:36.408 --> 50:37.659
Jae-young return home

50:38.577 --> 50:39.953
by any chance?

50:40.954 --> 50:43.331
-It's not funny.
-You don't understand the joke.

50:43.415 --> 50:45.542
No, not yet.

50:46.835 --> 50:48.545
What you just said…

50:50.964 --> 50:52.215
That's an insult.

51:20.744 --> 51:22.996
-You're not going to eat anything?
-No.

51:24.039 --> 51:25.540
I don't like the food here.

51:26.541 --> 51:28.001
It's hard to digest.

51:29.503 --> 51:31.630
This album is terrific.

51:33.256 --> 51:35.467
I can leave the compound this month.

51:35.550 --> 51:38.553
So I'll try to buy another record
at Saju Record Store.

51:39.137 --> 51:40.764
I saved up some money.

51:42.015 --> 51:44.142
I asked around

51:44.226 --> 51:46.937
and I heard that
Toy's newest album is good.

52:00.784 --> 52:04.329
I think I can get you some
comic books to read too.

52:04.913 --> 52:06.581
The masters are very busy

52:06.665 --> 52:08.959
because of the Cheonyang Water
Purification Plant matter.

52:09.668 --> 52:11.878
-If there's anything else you…
-Shi-young.

52:16.216 --> 52:18.426
I have something to tell you.

52:21.847 --> 52:22.889
The thing is…

52:24.641 --> 52:26.309
I want to leave this place.

52:32.440 --> 52:37.279
We cannot force you to stay longer
if you wish to be discharged.

52:38.071 --> 52:40.490
But you have to avoid any strenuous work.

52:41.116 --> 52:43.451
Even light exercise should be avoided.

52:44.077 --> 52:45.662
Okay, I'll do as you say.

52:51.084 --> 52:53.169
You have different visitors today.

52:53.920 --> 52:55.922
I'll see you next time, Detective Choi.

52:57.132 --> 53:00.010
You must rest. Please don't forget that.

53:00.760 --> 53:01.761
Okay.

53:04.890 --> 53:06.182
Hello, Detective Choi.

53:08.768 --> 53:10.979
It seems like
you're in law enforcement too.

53:11.980 --> 53:14.149
-Which department are you from?
-Pardon?

53:15.233 --> 53:17.485
We're from the Busan District
Prosecutors' Office.

53:21.573 --> 53:24.159
BUSAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE
KIM SUNG-HEE, INVESTIGATOR

53:28.955 --> 53:32.083
BUSAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

53:37.631 --> 53:40.342
Thank you for making the trip here.
Please come this way.

54:26.888 --> 54:28.098
I'm sorry

54:29.224 --> 54:31.559
but could you open the door for a minute?

54:43.196 --> 54:45.073
No. 5164.

54:45.156 --> 54:47.367
We'll start the procedure to transfer you.

54:47.993 --> 54:49.452
Stand next to the sink.

54:49.536 --> 54:51.121
Put both of your hands on the wall.
Commence.

55:12.017 --> 55:13.184
Don't leave any leftover food.

55:14.352 --> 55:15.729
It'll weigh more.

55:18.398 --> 55:19.274
Thanks.

55:20.191 --> 55:23.653
Thanks so much. I mean it!

56:00.148 --> 56:01.524
I'm ready.

56:25.548 --> 56:27.675
Who did you think was Guru?

56:34.724 --> 56:36.434
Let me rephrase that question.

56:36.518 --> 56:39.062
Have you met a person called Guru?

56:42.774 --> 56:44.067
Yes.

56:44.150 --> 56:46.653
You actually met Guru?

56:49.864 --> 56:50.949
Yes,

56:52.325 --> 56:53.409
I did.

57:21.438 --> 57:22.981
I'll be frank with you.

57:24.232 --> 57:26.443
We've tracked down
the identity of an individual

57:27.026 --> 57:28.236
called Guru.

57:29.154 --> 57:31.322
Inside our team, we're divided on whether

57:31.406 --> 57:33.867
Jung Young-seob is Guru or not.

57:35.076 --> 57:36.953
And if Jung Young-seob isn't Guru,

57:40.248 --> 57:42.041
then that only leaves one other person.

57:42.959 --> 57:44.752
But if it turns out to be that person,

57:45.295 --> 57:47.380
then it gets complicated.

57:48.631 --> 57:50.842
Complicated? Why?

57:50.925 --> 57:54.554
I want to hear your thoughts as someone
who worked on his case.

57:54.637 --> 57:57.015
I think it's necessary for us to know

57:57.098 --> 57:59.100
who you think Guru is

57:59.767 --> 58:01.060
and how dangerous he is.

58:01.144 --> 58:02.562
You said

58:03.521 --> 58:05.106
you would be frank with me, right?

58:06.483 --> 58:08.151
Tell me the point of this interview.

58:18.786 --> 58:19.996
He killed

58:21.206 --> 58:23.875
three nurses, one janitor

58:25.001 --> 58:26.711
and one prison guard.

58:28.838 --> 58:31.049
He just escaped
from the Institute of Forensic Psychiatry.

58:33.801 --> 58:35.053
He did?

58:36.429 --> 58:37.597
Yes.

58:44.812 --> 58:46.523
Jo Kyung-ho is missing.

59:57.427 --> 59:58.720
<i>We don't have time.</i>

59:59.345 --> 1:00:01.681
We have to track him down
as soon as possible.

1:00:01.764 --> 1:00:04.142
Well, I'm afraid of dying.

1:00:04.225 --> 1:00:05.643
<i>Are you afraid of me?</i>

1:00:05.727 --> 1:00:08.104
That woman. You can see her, right?

1:00:08.187 --> 1:00:10.481
<i>It'll be the beginning
of the Day of Purification.</i>

1:00:10.565 --> 1:00:11.566
Which means you could get killed.

1:00:11.649 --> 1:00:12.734
<i>I'm not going to change</i>

1:00:13.693 --> 1:00:15.320
<i>this plan.</i>

1:00:16.571 --> 1:00:18.906
<i>This is the only way.</i>

1:00:19.657 --> 1:00:22.493
Your sin has come to bite back.

1:00:26.581 --> 1:00:31.586
