Dr. Venture:
I still can't believe you agreed

19:07.905 --> 19:10.287
to come in the middle
of the night.

19:10.321 --> 19:13.980
[ Chuckles ]
Wait. Is this a booty call?

19:14.014 --> 19:15.775
This is a booty call,
isn't it?

19:15.809 --> 19:17.777
Uh, slow down.

19:17.811 --> 19:19.710
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

19:19.744 --> 19:21.574
You are the most honest man
I've ever met.

19:21.608 --> 19:24.232
You're completely fearless.
-Do you like it?

19:24.266 --> 19:25.647
I have no idea
what I'm doing.

19:25.681 --> 19:28.719
I'm so hopped up on this
atropine, theophylline,

19:28.753 --> 19:30.376
and antivenom
that Brock gave me.

19:30.410 --> 19:31.618
Whoo.
-Uh-huh.

19:31.653 --> 19:33.413
And is Brock the man
behind those bushes

19:33.448 --> 19:34.725
with a rifle
trained on me?

19:34.759 --> 19:38.211
Hi, Brock!
Yeah, he's my bodyguard.

19:38.246 --> 19:39.937
And this is my body.

19:39.971 --> 19:42.422
Well,
it's a very nice body.

19:42.457 --> 19:44.424
Hey,
I want to ask you something

19:44.459 --> 19:46.737
before all these pills I took
make me pass out.

19:46.771 --> 19:50.396
Do I have a chance here?

19:50.430 --> 19:52.915
I don't know what
people told you about me,

19:52.950 --> 19:54.641
but I doubt it's true.

19:54.676 --> 19:57.748
Well, I heard that

19:57.782 --> 20:01.476
you have a lot of
skeletons in your closet.

20:01.510 --> 20:03.650
Yeah, well, okay,
that one might be true.

20:03.685 --> 20:04.962
Tonight proved that.

20:04.996 --> 20:07.447
Lots of skeletons
in your clos--
I ran into a...

20:07.482 --> 20:12.728
well, an old friend,
right out in fro--

20:12.763 --> 20:14.834
I didn't do that!

20:14.868 --> 20:16.836
#21:
It really wasn't so bad.

20:16.870 --> 20:19.459
I mean, you didn't vomit
till she was gone,

20:19.494 --> 20:20.978
and she couldn't
see you do it, at least.

20:21.012 --> 20:22.635
Gary, I cried.

20:22.669 --> 20:25.465
Then my archnemesis hugged me.
Hugged me.

20:25.500 --> 20:26.846
Meanwhile,
at Stately Wayne Manor,

20:26.880 --> 20:28.468
my husband is home alone

20:28.503 --> 20:30.988
wondering if our partnership
is completely over.

20:31.022 --> 20:33.991
A-And it just might be.
-Well, when you put it that way.

20:34.025 --> 20:35.026
You done back there?

20:35.061 --> 20:37.339
Yep, and here it is --

20:37.374 --> 20:39.652
your past,
that smells like L.A. Looks.

20:39.686 --> 20:41.930
I never got over the wet look.
Guilty.

20:41.964 --> 20:44.035
Oh, I got something else
for you.

20:44.070 --> 20:46.831
-What's this?
-I lifted her wallet.

20:46.866 --> 20:49.489
Little Miss Fancy
got herself arched.

20:49.524 --> 20:52.458
You are a baller!

Dr. Mrs. The Monarch:
With perspicacious design
and calamitous intent,

21:23.696 --> 21:26.595
do you hereby resign
your individual animus

21:26.630 --> 21:29.943
and accept the collective odium
of the Guild Council?

21:29.978 --> 21:33.809
I do, and I look forward
to hating with all of you.

21:33.844 --> 21:35.949
Yeah, sure, man,
we're ready!

21:35.984 --> 21:37.917
Oh, dear, yes.
Very much so.

21:37.951 --> 21:40.402
With no reservations,
I accept.

21:40.437 --> 21:42.508
I regretfully decline.

21:42.542 --> 21:44.786
I still got a lot
of unresolved grudges.

21:44.820 --> 21:46.132
And let's face it,
all this?

21:46.166 --> 21:47.789
This ain't me.

21:47.823 --> 21:50.447
Of course. The Council
understands your position.

21:50.481 --> 21:53.346
Would you consider something
like a diplomatic appointment?

21:53.381 --> 21:55.659
I ain't going nowhere,
Madam Councilwoman.

21:55.693 --> 21:57.868
We'll talk.
-Councilman Limb?

21:57.902 --> 22:00.767
It is my honor
to become a full member

22:00.802 --> 22:02.873
of this most worthy
Council.

22:02.907 --> 22:05.047
And I would like
to add that last night,

22:05.082 --> 22:07.429
I was mighty in my victory.

22:07.464 --> 22:10.087
Like an inch mightier.
Seriously.

22:10.121 --> 22:11.916
This Council
has my loyalty,

22:11.951 --> 22:15.610
and I swear I shall defend
its honor with my life.

22:15.644 --> 22:19.441
And what say you,
Dr. Mrs. The Monarch?

22:19.476 --> 22:23.100
I-I...Uh, I...

22:23.134 --> 22:24.791
Madam Councilman?
