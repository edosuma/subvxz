00:08.432 --> 00:11.633
Hey, Charlie. So, exciting
times for the Duncan family.

00:11.634 --> 00:13.208
Tomorrow, you turn three!

00:13.209 --> 00:14.441
Yay!

00:14.442 --> 00:18.392
And if that wasn't exciting enough,
one week ago, the new baby was due.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.991
Let's see how that baby's doing now.

00:20.992 --> 00:23.692
I want you out!

00:24.166 --> 00:26.387
Duncan kid number five is late.

00:26.388 --> 00:30.446
And Duncan kid number two
is getting on my nerves.

00:30.447 --> 00:31.606
Moving on.

00:31.607 --> 00:33.487
Anyway, I'm hoping for a baby girl.

00:33.488 --> 00:34.946
I'm hoping for a baby boy.

00:34.947 --> 00:36.051
Yeah.

00:36.052 --> 00:36.986
Me too.

00:36.987 --> 00:39.012
I want a younger brother to pick on.

00:39.013 --> 00:41.662
I'm tired of picking on my older brother.

00:41.663 --> 00:44.305
Oh, boy or girl doesn't matter to me.

00:44.306 --> 00:46.031
Whatever Mom wants, I want.

00:46.032 --> 00:48.732
Don't touch me.

00:48.779 --> 00:51.269
Never again, honey.

00:51.270 --> 00:57.150
Once again I've kept the camera
on just a smidge too long.

00:57.775 --> 00:59.203
Guys, this is all just too much.

00:59.204 --> 01:02.261
The new baby's about to come, and
Charlie's birthday tomorrow.

01:02.262 --> 01:04.575
Just so long as they don't
happen on the same day.

01:04.575 --> 01:05.875
- What do you mean?
- Well, think about it.

01:05.876 --> 01:09.001
Wouldn't it be kind of sad if Charlie had
to share her birthday with the new baby?

01:09.002 --> 01:10.167
I'll tell you what's sad.

01:10.168 --> 01:13.177
We're out of French Toast sticks.

01:13.178 --> 01:15.925
Teddy, honey, the baby's gonna
come when the baby wants to come.

01:15.926 --> 01:17.807
But if it does happen to be tomorrow,

01:17.808 --> 01:20.304
I need everyone to help out
with Charlie's birthday.

01:20.305 --> 01:23.504
Mom, I'm willing to help out
by doing what I always do.

01:23.505 --> 01:24.888
You don't ever do anything.

01:24.889 --> 01:27.335
And nobody does it better.

01:27.336 --> 01:30.420
All I'm saying is if
somebody goes to the trouble

01:30.421 --> 01:36.270
of inventing French Toast sticks, the
least we could do is buy their product.

01:36.271 --> 01:38.768
Bob, honey, you took care of those
things I asked you to handle, right?

01:38.769 --> 01:39.693
I..

01:39.694 --> 01:41.431
Certainly did.

01:41.432 --> 01:44.631
Why was there a pause between
"I" and "certainly"?

01:44.632 --> 01:45.627
No pause.

01:50.607 --> 01:53.036
So, you bought the
baby's new car seat,

01:53.037 --> 01:55.230
and the doll Charlie
wants for her birthday?

01:55.231 --> 01:57.254
Honey. I did it all.

01:57.255 --> 01:59.817
Okay? Mission accomplished.

01:59.818 --> 02:01.618
I..

02:02.100 --> 02:04.500
Believe you.

02:05.543 --> 02:07.282
Uh, Gabe?

02:07.283 --> 02:09.895
- Yeah?
- Listen, here is, uh..

02:09.895 --> 02:11.612
Here's 50 bucks.

02:11.613 --> 02:12.761
I need you to go down to the mall.

02:12.762 --> 02:14.501
I need you to get that doll for Charlie.

02:14.502 --> 02:15.759
Dad, why can't you do it?

02:15.760 --> 02:19.600
Because I gotta buy a car seat.

02:22.129 --> 02:24.114
You know how some little girls grow up

02:24.115 --> 02:27.886
and pick a husband who's
just like their Daddy?

02:27.887 --> 02:31.607
I'm gonna go a different way.

02:33.618 --> 02:36.816
<i>Today's all burnt toast
running late and Dad jokes.</i>

02:36.817 --> 02:39.993
<i>"Has anybody seen my left shoe?"</i>

02:39.994 --> 02:41.750
<i>I close my eyes, take a bite.</i>

02:41.751 --> 02:43.380
<i>Grab a ride, laugh out loud.</i>

02:43.381 --> 02:46.839
<i>There it is up on the roof.</i>

02:46.840 --> 02:49.926
<i>I've been there, I survived.</i>

02:49.927 --> 02:53.167
<i>So just take my advice.</i>

02:53.282 --> 02:56.637
<i>Hang in there, baby
things are crazy.</i>

02:56.638 --> 02:59.573
<i>But I know your future's bright.</i>

02:59.574 --> 03:03.013
<i>Hang in there, baby
there's no maybe.</i>

03:03.014 --> 03:05.857
<i>Everything turns out all right.</i>

03:05.858 --> 03:08.183
<i>Sure life is up and down.</i>

03:08.184 --> 03:12.051
<i>But trust me, it comes back around.</i>

03:12.052 --> 03:16.732
<i>You're gonna love who
you turn out to be.</i>

03:17.036 --> 03:20.036
<i>Hang in there, baby.</i>

03:25.888 --> 03:27.116
Hey, honey?

03:27.117 --> 03:28.080
Hey, come on.

03:28.081 --> 03:30.015
There's something I want to show you.

03:30.016 --> 03:31.391
Honey, come on.

03:31.392 --> 03:33.854
I'm moving as fast as I can.

03:33.855 --> 03:37.155
Wide load coming through.

03:37.628 --> 03:39.037
Look.

03:39.038 --> 03:39.973
Look.

03:39.974 --> 03:41.728
New car seat is in.

03:41.729 --> 03:43.767
- Good.
- Yeah.

03:43.768 --> 03:47.131
Bought it three days ago. Well, whatever.

03:47.132 --> 03:48.608
Looks a little crowded in here.

03:48.609 --> 03:52.557
Well, honey, we're gonna be up front.
Who cares what happens in the back?

03:52.558 --> 03:53.753
Bob, I don't think there's enough room.

03:53.754 --> 03:54.711
Sure there is.

03:54.712 --> 03:57.715
No, Bob, with five kids, I
think we might need a new car.

03:57.716 --> 03:59.356
Slow down.

03:59.357 --> 04:00.833
No, no, no, no, no.

04:00.834 --> 04:02.210
Enough room in here for everybody.

04:02.211 --> 04:04.569
Look, Charlie sits here,
new baby over there,

04:04.570 --> 04:06.385
one kid back there, the other over there.

04:06.386 --> 04:08.398
Done. Problem solved.

04:08.399 --> 04:10.678
You forgot a kid.

04:10.679 --> 04:11.408
Which one?

04:11.409 --> 04:13.989
I don't know.

04:14.027 --> 04:16.829
But I know there are five.

04:16.829 --> 04:18.065
This can work.

04:18.067 --> 04:21.307
Let me show you.. Kids!

04:23.837 --> 04:25.449
There, see?

04:25.450 --> 04:28.030
Piece of cake.

04:28.667 --> 04:30.282
How's everybody doing back there?

04:30.283 --> 04:32.225
PJ keeps poking me with his rib.

04:32.226 --> 04:35.346
It's called breathing.

04:35.649 --> 04:37.208
Honey, Gabe doesn't have a seat belt.

04:37.209 --> 04:39.369
Or a seat.

04:39.370 --> 04:42.010
He'll be fine.

04:43.093 --> 04:44.556
Hey, Charlie?

04:44.557 --> 04:45.694
Are you comfortable?

04:45.695 --> 04:47.495
No.

04:50.061 --> 04:51.312
- Bob?
- Yes?

04:51.313 --> 04:54.433
- New car?
- New car.

05:01.124 --> 05:02.571
Okay.

05:02.572 --> 05:04.972
Here we go.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:29.888 --> 05:31.688
Oh.

05:42.450 --> 05:45.030
Hey, Mom? Oh..

05:45.850 --> 05:47.621
What are you doing?

05:47.622 --> 05:48.994
Painting my toenails.

05:48.995 --> 05:52.940
Just because I can't see them doesn't
mean they shouldn't look good.

05:52.941 --> 05:56.993
Oh. Well in that case, you might
want to consider clipping them.

05:56.994 --> 05:58.230
Can I help you?

05:58.231 --> 06:01.191
Well, I am actually
here to help you.

06:01.192 --> 06:03.580
So, Mom, I know that
you've been very anxious

06:03.581 --> 06:05.792
to get this baby out,
so I went online

06:05.793 --> 06:07.750
and I looked up some natural
ways to induce labor.

06:07.751 --> 06:08.654
Ooh, like what?

06:08.655 --> 06:11.556
Well, uh, there's a bunch of techniques,
but the first one includes..

06:11.557 --> 06:13.417
Boo!

06:15.245 --> 06:16.882
What was that?

06:16.883 --> 06:19.268
I was trying to scare the baby out.

06:19.269 --> 06:21.701
Well, it didn't work.

06:21.702 --> 06:22.869
Okay.

06:22.870 --> 06:25.665
Fine, well, there's always some
other stuff we can try, like..

06:25.666 --> 06:26.551
Boo!

06:26.552 --> 06:28.832
Stop that.

06:30.088 --> 06:31.710
Okay, you know, it's a baby.

06:31.711 --> 06:34.831
It's not the hiccups.

06:39.273 --> 06:41.195
So, what do you want to do today?

06:41.196 --> 06:43.307
Well, it's a beautiful day.

06:43.308 --> 06:45.966
Sun shining, the birds are chirping..

06:45.967 --> 06:47.878
So, video games in the basement?

06:47.879 --> 06:49.118
Whew!

06:49.119 --> 06:52.811
Dude, you had me scared there for a
minute with all the outdoor talk.

06:52.812 --> 06:54.771
All right, let's go.

06:54.772 --> 06:55.993
Wait.

06:55.994 --> 07:01.119
I promised my Dad I'd go to the store
and buy Charlie a stupid doll.

07:01.120 --> 07:03.193
And I told my Mom I was at the library.

07:03.194 --> 07:05.250
So what?

07:05.251 --> 07:07.335
No, Jake, I really have to go do this.

07:07.336 --> 07:08.432
So, who's stopping you?

07:08.433 --> 07:10.440
I'll wait right here.

07:10.441 --> 07:13.337
Yeah, you know I'm not allowed to
leave you in this house alone.

07:13.338 --> 07:15.473
Come on.

07:15.474 --> 07:20.454
Man, you take one bubble
bath, you get labeled.

07:23.302 --> 07:24.803
What's all this?

07:24.804 --> 07:26.304
I got us some yoga balls.

07:26.305 --> 07:28.836
Another way to induce labor
is through bouncing.

07:28.837 --> 07:30.588
All right, I'll try anything.

07:30.589 --> 07:33.289
Hit it, Charlie.

07:42.891 --> 07:44.423
Feel anything?

07:44.424 --> 07:45.442
I feel silly.

07:45.443 --> 07:48.083
You look silly.

07:48.267 --> 07:49.519
Oh.

07:49.520 --> 07:51.141
Teddy, this isn't going to work.

07:51.142 --> 07:53.602
Do it again.

07:57.675 --> 07:59.477
Dude, I can't be seen doll shopping.

07:59.478 --> 08:02.354
I'll lose my street cred.

08:02.355 --> 08:07.406
Yeah, I think you lost that when you
started giggling in the bra Department.

08:07.407 --> 08:10.576
Let's just buy this thing
and get out of here.

08:10.577 --> 08:11.820
Kuddle Me Katie?

08:11.821 --> 08:13.324
That's stupid.

08:13.325 --> 08:14.930
Goo-goo.

08:14.931 --> 08:16.512
It said goo-goo.

08:16.513 --> 08:18.313
Aw.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.741
Whoa, look what they just released.

08:25.742 --> 08:27.413
Attack of the Zartians.

08:27.414 --> 08:29.948
Oh, right. I heard about this game.

08:29.949 --> 08:32.424
Zartians are martians that
were bitten by zombies.

08:32.426 --> 08:34.801
Ewe. That's disgusting.

08:34.802 --> 08:36.606
What are they covered in, blood or puke?

08:36.607 --> 08:39.187
Hopefully both.

08:39.501 --> 08:40.566
Let's get it.

08:40.567 --> 08:42.557
It's 50 bucks. I don't have 50 bucks.

08:42.558 --> 08:44.484
Yeah, you do.

08:44.485 --> 08:45.783
Wait a minute.

08:45.784 --> 08:48.798
- Are you.. Are you saying..
- That's exactly what I'm saying.

08:48.799 --> 08:52.732
You're gonna buy this
game with the doll money.

08:52.733 --> 08:53.618
Yeah.

08:53.619 --> 08:55.759
- And then what?
- We play it.

08:55.760 --> 08:59.500
- After we play it?
- We play it again.

08:59.501 --> 09:01.824
Well, what about Charlie's doll?

09:01.825 --> 09:02.794
I promised my Dad.

09:02.795 --> 09:06.067
Dude, we're teenagers now.
We're supposed to be rebels.

09:06.068 --> 09:08.431
Your Mom still picks out your underwear.

09:08.432 --> 09:10.542
And sometimes I wear it backwards.

09:10.543 --> 09:12.883
On purpose.

09:13.670 --> 09:15.150
You know what? I'm gonna buy this game,

09:15.151 --> 09:20.551
but just so we can stop
talking about your underwear.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.164
Hey, Mom.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.165
How you doing?

09:26.166 --> 09:31.057
I am tired, bloated, cranky, I have
never been more miserable in my life.

09:31.058 --> 09:32.061
That's nice.

09:32.062 --> 09:33.982
Hey..

09:36.117 --> 09:39.208
I just did a quick freezer check..

09:39.209 --> 09:42.890
Still not seeing the French Toast sticks.

09:42.891 --> 09:44.688
I bought you some.

09:44.689 --> 09:48.889
Yeah, you bought French Toast squares.

09:49.117 --> 09:54.289
Well, if you want sticks, then just
take the squares and cut them in half.

09:54.290 --> 09:55.845
Cut them in half?

09:55.846 --> 09:59.124
But then you cut the fun in half.

09:59.125 --> 10:00.549
Honey, you'll figure it out.

10:00.550 --> 10:03.071
I guess I could take the cut squares..

10:03.072 --> 10:07.872
And glue them together
lengthwise with syrup..

10:08.213 --> 10:12.353
Or would jam make a better adhesive?

10:12.887 --> 10:16.067
I'd better nap on it.

10:18.477 --> 10:20.722
That's your big brother, PJ.

10:20.723 --> 10:23.963
He's not the smartest..

10:24.106 --> 10:26.446
That's it.

10:27.487 --> 10:29.464
Hey, Mom. You hungry?

10:29.465 --> 10:30.400
Oh, no.

10:30.401 --> 10:31.449
Honey, I couldn't eat anything.

10:31.450 --> 10:34.530
I'm so big, I just.. I just..

10:34.531 --> 10:37.051
What you got?

10:37.063 --> 10:39.858
Vindaloo Pepper Curry from
the new Indian place.

10:39.859 --> 10:43.257
Because I read that another way to
induce labor is with spicy food.

10:43.258 --> 10:44.367
Is it really that spicy?

10:44.368 --> 10:47.654
Yeah, so spicy, they made me sign a waiver.

10:47.655 --> 10:51.030
And attend a brief seminar.

10:51.031 --> 10:53.611
Let's try it.

10:56.737 --> 10:58.014
Dad!

10:58.015 --> 11:00.406
I set that down, like, one minute ago.

11:00.407 --> 11:04.067
Stuff's got some kick to it.

11:04.290 --> 11:07.170
What else you got?

11:10.224 --> 11:13.411
So, uh, how is belly
dancing supposed to help?

11:13.412 --> 11:17.188
Well, they say that it's good
to exercise your core, and..

11:17.189 --> 11:18.787
Let's face it, right now..

11:18.788 --> 11:21.326
You're all core.

11:21.327 --> 11:22.064
Oh..

11:22.065 --> 11:23.824
- Check it out, this is fun.
- Mm-hum.

11:23.825 --> 11:25.296
And surprise, surprise.

11:25.297 --> 11:27.310
I'm good at it.

11:27.311 --> 11:28.461
Feel anything, Mom?

11:28.462 --> 11:30.761
Feel like I'm kicking your
butt at belly dancing.

11:30.762 --> 11:32.790
- Oh, no, you're not.
- Oh, yes, I am.

11:32.791 --> 11:34.534
- Bring it.
- Consider it brung.

11:34.535 --> 11:35.869
Uh, yeah.

11:35.870 --> 11:38.076
- Oh!
- Yeah!

11:38.077 --> 11:40.112
Yeah, you just got served.

11:40.113 --> 11:43.398
In a bowl, with a spoon.

11:43.399 --> 11:48.739
Didn't realize belly dancing
had so much trash talk.

11:58.329 --> 11:59.793
Man, this is frustrating.

11:59.794 --> 12:01.022
Yeah, I know.

12:01.023 --> 12:02.463
They really need to make bigger keyboards

12:02.464 --> 12:06.526
for people with big, sausage-y fingers.

12:06.527 --> 12:09.018
What are you talking about?

12:09.019 --> 12:12.499
What are you talking about?

12:13.872 --> 12:16.959
I'm trying to figure out
what kind of car to buy.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.679
Problem is, you got too many choices.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.480
And then you gotta figure out..

12:20.481 --> 12:21.768
Mileage and..

12:21.769 --> 12:24.101
Color, safety, reliability..

12:24.102 --> 12:25.572
You know what? This is impossible.

12:25.573 --> 12:27.230
Well, what about this one?

12:27.231 --> 12:29.786
I mean, look how happy
it's making that family.

12:29.787 --> 12:32.472
Oh, and they're going across the country.

12:32.473 --> 12:34.415
Mount Rushmore.

12:34.416 --> 12:36.681
The Grand Canyon..

12:36.682 --> 12:38.150
Grandma's house.

12:38.151 --> 12:39.951
PJ.

12:40.359 --> 12:43.450
Come on, it's just a commercial, you..

12:43.451 --> 12:44.408
Hey, they brought her a puppy.

12:44.409 --> 12:46.209
Aw.

12:46.646 --> 12:50.426
Oh, it's just what she wanted.

12:50.764 --> 12:52.531
We have to get that car.

12:52.532 --> 12:55.832
If we want to be happy.

13:04.137 --> 13:06.987
Okay, how is a salad going
to help me go into labor?

13:06.988 --> 13:08.822
Not the salad, the dressing.

13:08.823 --> 13:10.294
See, this place is famous for it.

13:10.295 --> 13:14.605
They have this special secret ingredient
that just pops a kid right out.

13:14.606 --> 13:15.551
It's worth a shot.

13:15.552 --> 13:19.473
Besides, I haven't eaten
in like, 15 minutes.

13:19.474 --> 13:21.051
Hi. Can I help you?

13:21.052 --> 13:23.470
Yes. A table for two, please.

13:23.471 --> 13:26.498
Sure, can I get your name?
We have about a three-hour wait.

13:26.499 --> 13:27.630
Three hours?

13:27.631 --> 13:29.665
But we need a table right away.

13:29.666 --> 13:31.536
Yes, I'm pregnant.

13:31.537 --> 13:33.381
It's kind of a special circumstance.

13:33.382 --> 13:39.282
Oh, well, in that case, you can
wait in our special section.

13:40.830 --> 13:42.690
Doh!

13:48.641 --> 13:50.174
This is ridiculous.

13:50.175 --> 13:51.983
I can't believe they're making
us stand here like this.

13:51.984 --> 13:53.895
I'm seven days overdue.

13:53.896 --> 13:54.919
Seven days?

13:54.920 --> 13:56.804
Try nine days on for size.

13:56.805 --> 14:00.096
I'm looking back at seven
days like it was a party.

14:00.097 --> 14:01.144
Oh, yeah?

14:01.145 --> 14:03.115
I have enough gas to fly to London.

14:03.116 --> 14:04.884
Try China.

14:04.885 --> 14:08.185
How's that table coming?

14:11.848 --> 14:14.773
- All right.
- I can't wait to play this game.

14:14.774 --> 14:18.400
Yeah, I was getting that from the way
you opened the box with your teeth.

14:18.401 --> 14:19.849
That's how I open everything.

14:19.850 --> 14:23.220
Why do you think I need braces?

14:23.221 --> 14:25.776
Now, if my Dad comes down.

14:25.777 --> 14:30.263
And asks where the doll is,
what am I gonna tell him?

14:30.264 --> 14:31.331
Okay, I got it.

14:31.332 --> 14:36.369
I'll tell him that.. On the way to the
toy store, I got beat up by a gang.

14:36.370 --> 14:37.591
And..

14:37.592 --> 14:42.692
They stole the money and
I'm lucky to be alive.

14:42.734 --> 14:45.244
Dude, it's your Dad we're talking about.

14:45.245 --> 14:48.490
Why are you working so hard on a story?

14:48.491 --> 14:50.225
You know what?

14:50.226 --> 14:51.928
You're right.

14:51.929 --> 14:55.788
Why am I worried about
Charlie's stupid doll anyway?

14:55.789 --> 14:58.489
All right, here.

15:01.129 --> 15:02.672
Uh-oh. What's that?

15:02.673 --> 15:03.940
"Warning."

15:03.941 --> 15:07.022
"Contains scenes of graphic violence."

15:07.023 --> 15:11.223
"Parental supervision strongly advised."

15:11.578 --> 15:13.438
Yes!

15:16.129 --> 15:19.779
Well, I retain so much water,
I slosh when I walk.

15:19.780 --> 15:21.244
I slosh when I sleep.

15:21.245 --> 15:22.165
Oh, you sleep?

15:22.166 --> 15:23.351
Oh, Mom.

15:23.352 --> 15:24.857
I just thought of a great idea.

15:24.858 --> 15:26.464
Why don't we get the salads to go?

15:26.465 --> 15:28.118
Don't you think we thought of that?

15:28.119 --> 15:29.706
They don't do takeout here.

15:29.707 --> 15:32.878
Sure hope your next kid
is smarter than this one.

15:32.879 --> 15:33.776
Hey.

15:33.777 --> 15:36.157
Nobody insults my kids but me.

15:36.158 --> 15:37.117
You want a piece of me?

15:37.118 --> 15:40.969
- You want a piece of me?
- Okay! Ladies, let's break it up.

15:40.970 --> 15:43.329
Let's just go, okay?
I can't do this for three hours.

15:43.330 --> 15:45.536
What? No, Mom. We have to stick it out.

15:45.537 --> 15:47.211
The baby has to be born today.

15:47.212 --> 15:48.474
Tomorrow's Charlie's birthday.

15:48.475 --> 15:50.981
Honey, I know that.
But we're out of options here.

15:50.982 --> 15:53.322
Or are we?

15:53.722 --> 15:56.422
Look over there.

15:56.965 --> 15:58.623
That must be the salad dressing.

15:58.624 --> 16:02.740
Okay, so you create a distraction
for everyone, and I'll go get it.

16:02.741 --> 16:06.291
We're going to steal salad dressing?

16:06.292 --> 16:10.012
The student becomes the master.

16:16.645 --> 16:18.203
Oh my!

16:18.204 --> 16:20.460
Oh my! It's happening.

16:20.461 --> 16:24.301
Oh, Mama's having a baby child!

16:24.390 --> 16:26.130
Okay, just stay calm.

16:26.131 --> 16:27.172
Everything's gonna be okay.

16:27.173 --> 16:30.182
- Okay.
- Just breathe.

16:30.183 --> 16:31.944
Oh, you know what?

16:31.945 --> 16:32.703
False alarm.

16:32.704 --> 16:34.684
Sorry.

16:35.465 --> 16:40.576
Everybody go back to your salads,
nothing more to see here.

16:40.577 --> 16:42.367
Oh.

16:42.368 --> 16:45.057
Let's get out of here.

16:45.058 --> 16:47.274
Hey! Stop them, they've got the dressing.

16:47.275 --> 16:49.675
Run for it!

16:50.640 --> 16:52.117
Oh. Okay.

16:52.118 --> 16:53.604
Hey, everybody relax.

16:53.605 --> 16:56.969
Yeah, no need to get crazy, okay, there's
plenty of dressing for everyone.

16:56.970 --> 16:58.190
I am having twins.

16:58.191 --> 16:59.041
I want double.

16:59.042 --> 17:03.075
Oh, yeah? I'm gonna need
to see an ultrasound.

17:03.076 --> 17:05.025
Hey, hey! Back off.

17:05.026 --> 17:07.765
One more step and the dressing gets it.

17:07.766 --> 17:08.936
That's right.

17:08.938 --> 17:10.186
You heard her.

17:10.188 --> 17:14.353
Now everyone waddle away real nice-like.

17:14.354 --> 17:17.233
You first, twinsie.

17:32.267 --> 17:33.418
So, Bob.

17:33.419 --> 17:35.774
What got you interested in the Serenade?

17:35.775 --> 17:39.543
Well, the mileage,
safety, reliability..

17:39.544 --> 17:41.122
Was it the puppy?

17:41.123 --> 17:43.043
Yeah.

17:44.477 --> 17:46.018
So, what do you think?

17:46.019 --> 17:47.342
Rides pretty smooth, doesn't it?

17:47.343 --> 17:49.371
Yeah, it's.. It's okay, I guess.

17:49.372 --> 17:50.523
Are you kidding?

17:50.524 --> 17:53.226
I feel like I'm floating on a cloud.

17:53.227 --> 17:56.259
A cloud with seat warmers.

17:56.260 --> 18:00.760
So that's why I'm so toasty down there.

18:00.983 --> 18:02.611
Sounds like your boy likes the car.

18:02.612 --> 18:04.697
Six cup holders?!

18:04.698 --> 18:07.518
Serenade! Serenade!

18:07.857 --> 18:09.855
Serenade!

18:09.856 --> 18:11.367
What do you say, Bob?

18:11.368 --> 18:13.729
You want to go inside and
we'll crunch some numbers?

18:13.730 --> 18:16.269
Um.. Could you give us a minute, Stu?

18:16.270 --> 18:20.470
Sure thing. I'll be in the showroom.

18:22.152 --> 18:23.560
PJ!

18:23.561 --> 18:25.864
What are you doing?
You're blowing the whole deal!

18:25.865 --> 18:26.939
What do you mean?

18:26.940 --> 18:30.381
If Stu thinks we like the car, we're
gonna have to pay more for it.

18:30.382 --> 18:33.543
We gotta make him think
we don't want the car.

18:33.544 --> 18:35.164
So there's a chance we won't buy it?

18:35.165 --> 18:37.414
Are you kidding me? I love this thing!

18:37.415 --> 18:40.895
Serenade! Serenade! Serenade!

18:45.956 --> 18:50.816
Never knew pregnant women
could be so vicious.

18:52.564 --> 18:54.746
It was horrifying.

18:54.747 --> 18:59.787
That one gal chewed off
a couple of my buttons.

19:01.921 --> 19:04.219
Why don't we go downstairs
again and try bouncing..

19:04.220 --> 19:05.316
Oh, no, no, no, no.

19:05.317 --> 19:06.554
Sweetie, we are done.

19:06.555 --> 19:08.307
Okay, we've tried everything.

19:08.308 --> 19:11.489
This baby is gonna come when it wants to.

19:11.490 --> 19:12.742
I guess you're right.

19:12.743 --> 19:14.123
And if it is born on Charlie's birthday,

19:14.124 --> 19:15.735
maybe that wouldn't be such a bad thing.

19:15.736 --> 19:16.549
What do you mean?

19:16.550 --> 19:17.915
Well, I don't know, with..

19:17.916 --> 19:20.631
Five kids, maybe it wouldn't
hurt to double up on birthdays.

19:20.632 --> 19:21.742
You know..

19:21.743 --> 19:25.627
Less parties, less
presents, less headaches..

19:25.628 --> 19:26.619
Hey.

19:26.620 --> 19:32.520
Maybe I can tell Charlie and the
baby they were born on December 25.

19:36.329 --> 19:38.296
So, follow my lead.

19:38.297 --> 19:39.100
Play it cool.

19:39.101 --> 19:42.298
Oh, and whatever happens, don't
get too overenthusiastic.

19:42.299 --> 19:44.022
Don't worry about me, big guy.

19:44.023 --> 19:47.185
I will be cool with a capital "K."

19:47.186 --> 19:48.911
And don't do any spelling.

19:48.912 --> 19:50.892
Check.

19:51.235 --> 19:53.269
Have a seat, fellas.

19:53.270 --> 19:55.122
In these chairs?

19:55.123 --> 19:56.240
Forget it.

19:56.241 --> 19:57.273
They're pieces of junk.

19:57.274 --> 19:58.547
We're not buying the chairs.

19:58.548 --> 20:01.668
Darn right we're not.

20:02.758 --> 20:06.058
It's not even that fun.

20:06.216 --> 20:07.544
So, what do you think, Bob?

20:07.545 --> 20:09.454
Will you be driving home
in a Serenade today?

20:09.455 --> 20:11.430
Well, uh..

20:11.431 --> 20:14.526
I don't know, Stu. I guess it, uh,
depends on what you can do for me.

20:14.527 --> 20:16.325
Yeah, Stu. What have you got?

20:16.326 --> 20:18.546
Bring it.

20:20.241 --> 20:22.774
Does this price work for you?

20:22.775 --> 20:25.946
Does.. This work for you?

20:25.947 --> 20:27.891
Whoa, whoa, whoa. PJ, PJ?

20:27.892 --> 20:30.651
We actually have to look at the offers.

20:30.652 --> 20:33.980
Amateur move, but go ahead.

20:33.981 --> 20:35.554
Look, Bob.

20:35.555 --> 20:37.591
I want to make you happy.

20:37.592 --> 20:41.252
What do you think about this?

20:44.787 --> 20:46.048
This is your offer?

20:46.049 --> 20:47.340
PJ..

20:47.341 --> 20:50.498
This is your beef, Stu?

20:50.499 --> 20:52.068
Get it? "Beef Stu"?

20:52.069 --> 20:56.209
- Yeah, we.. We all got it.
- Yeah.

20:57.017 --> 21:01.097
Come on, Dad.
We are out of here.

21:04.755 --> 21:07.455
Dad? You coming?

21:08.243 --> 21:09.658
I, uh..

21:09.659 --> 21:11.805
Chose the wrong child to
come with me today, Stu.

21:11.806 --> 21:14.506
I.. I apologize.

21:29.203 --> 21:30.547
How long have we been playing?

21:30.548 --> 21:32.096
Six hours.

21:32.097 --> 21:33.848
My eyes are burning.

21:33.849 --> 21:36.450
You should blink once in a while.

21:36.451 --> 21:38.255
That's exactly what they want.

21:38.256 --> 21:40.743
Who are you working for, the Zartian King?

21:40.744 --> 21:43.084
Easy, dude.

21:45.464 --> 21:46.895
Your phone's ringing again.

21:46.896 --> 21:48.925
It's just my Mom wondering where I am.

21:48.926 --> 21:51.806
Off to voice mail.

21:53.112 --> 21:55.556
I'm gonna go down this alley
and check for mutants.

21:55.557 --> 21:57.777
Cover me.

22:00.237 --> 22:02.347
You having fun, Gabe?

22:02.348 --> 22:04.268
Whoa.

22:05.436 --> 22:06.421
Did you see that?

22:06.422 --> 22:07.303
What?

22:07.304 --> 22:10.207
My Dad. He was.. He was in the
game and he was talking to me.

22:10.208 --> 22:11.240
That's normal.

22:11.241 --> 22:15.156
After six hours, you're gonna hallucinate.

22:15.157 --> 22:16.045
Really?

22:16.046 --> 22:17.320
Yeah. It was a warning on the box.

22:17.321 --> 22:19.961
You've just got to power through it.

22:19.962 --> 22:21.288
Okay.

22:21.289 --> 22:23.869
You're right. Just got to focus.

22:23.870 --> 22:26.871
We got to get that level nine monster.

22:26.872 --> 22:29.460
It's your baby sister's birthday.

22:29.461 --> 22:31.104
All she wanted was a doll.

22:31.105 --> 22:32.847
Maybe you're the monster.

22:32.848 --> 22:34.648
Ah!

22:36.110 --> 22:37.346
What are you doing?

22:37.347 --> 22:43.247
We're done. And tomorrow we're taking the
game back and getting Charlie her doll.

22:44.045 --> 22:45.147
What's wrong with your hands?

22:45.148 --> 22:46.467
I don't know.

22:46.468 --> 22:48.628
Help me.

22:56.644 --> 23:00.467
Oh, happy first birthday,
you adorable baby.

23:00.468 --> 23:02.268
Aw.

23:03.262 --> 23:05.012
Aw, look at that smile.

23:05.013 --> 23:07.057
- Aw.
- Check out those cheeks.

23:07.058 --> 23:08.368
I could just eat you up.

23:08.369 --> 23:10.122
You are the cutest baby ever.

23:10.123 --> 23:11.540
Yes, you are.

23:11.541 --> 23:13.316
It's my birthday, too.

23:13.317 --> 23:14.689
Oh, and Daddy loves you.

23:14.690 --> 23:16.624
That's right, Daddy lu-lu you.

23:16.625 --> 23:17.689
Aw.

23:17.690 --> 23:19.910
I'm sad.

23:23.129 --> 23:26.129
Oh, my little angel.

23:26.615 --> 23:28.635
I could never forget you.

23:28.636 --> 23:32.484
I'll never forget you either, baby.

23:32.485 --> 23:34.645
Not you.

23:41.714 --> 23:43.694
Teddy.

23:43.804 --> 23:45.026
Morning, Mom.

23:45.027 --> 23:48.874
Teddy, I can't have this baby today.

23:48.875 --> 23:52.160
Charlie needs to have her special birthday.

23:52.161 --> 23:53.786
That's what I've been saying all along.

23:53.787 --> 23:57.272
Yeah, but now I'm saying it.

23:57.273 --> 23:59.959
Okay, well, what made you change your mind?

23:59.960 --> 24:01.635
I had this horrible dream last night.

24:01.636 --> 24:04.171
The entire family was just
being so mean to Charlie..

24:04.172 --> 24:05.477
Ignoring her.

24:05.478 --> 24:06.699
Even you.

24:06.700 --> 24:08.456
What were you doing in the dream?

24:08.457 --> 24:11.377
I was doing what I always do.

24:11.378 --> 24:15.578
Fighting bravely to make things right.

24:16.047 --> 24:19.037
Okay, look, the point is I
can't have the baby today.

24:19.038 --> 24:21.547
Charlie needs her special day.

24:21.548 --> 24:24.883
All right, well, however you
got here, I totally agree.

24:24.884 --> 24:27.209
We'll just make sure that you don't
have the baby until tomorrow.

24:27.210 --> 24:28.769
Exactly. Okay.

24:28.770 --> 24:31.353
Okay, operation get baby out.

24:31.354 --> 24:34.344
Has officially become
operation keep baby in.

24:34.345 --> 24:37.930
I need complete rest and relaxation, okay?

24:37.931 --> 24:39.824
Nothing but peace..

24:39.825 --> 24:40.961
Calm.

24:40.962 --> 24:43.242
And quiet.

24:44.298 --> 24:45.189
Morning, honey.

24:45.190 --> 24:47.710
I said quiet!

24:48.559 --> 24:52.219
Yeah. Another day in paradise.

24:58.162 --> 24:58.935
Next.

24:58.936 --> 25:01.774
Hi, we'd like to return this game, please.

25:01.775 --> 25:02.888
Has it been opened?

25:02.889 --> 25:04.809
Nope.

25:05.039 --> 25:10.917
Then why is it covered in tape and
what appears to be teeth marks?

25:10.918 --> 25:12.279
Okay.

25:12.280 --> 25:14.315
I'm gonna level with you.

25:14.316 --> 25:16.437
We bought this game by accident.

25:16.438 --> 25:18.881
And then, Jake here..

25:18.882 --> 25:20.473
Accidentally opened it.

25:20.474 --> 25:25.028
And then we accidentally
played it for six hours.

25:25.029 --> 25:27.331
Guys, I'm sorry, you can't return this.

25:27.332 --> 25:28.932
Oh, no, we don't want to return it.

25:28.933 --> 25:30.855
We want to exchange it..

25:30.856 --> 25:33.136
For money.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.053
Next.

25:36.666 --> 25:39.075
Oh, this is bad.

25:39.076 --> 25:40.461
What am I gonna do?

25:40.462 --> 25:41.924
Only thing you can do.

25:41.925 --> 25:43.615
You gotta steal the doll.

25:43.616 --> 25:45.068
Steal the doll? But that's wrong.

25:45.069 --> 25:49.724
Well, exactly. You know the old
saying, "two wrongs make a right."

25:49.725 --> 25:51.835
No, it's "two wrongs don't make a right."

25:51.836 --> 25:52.902
Oh.

25:52.903 --> 25:54.504
Well, then, you know the other old saying..

25:54.505 --> 25:58.086
"Sometimes you gotta steal a doll."

25:58.087 --> 26:00.000
I'm not gonna steal the doll.

26:00.001 --> 26:02.134
Well, can we at least steal candy?

26:02.135 --> 26:03.647
No.

26:03.648 --> 26:08.868
Then what's the point of
even going to the store?

26:09.797 --> 26:11.388
Serenade!

26:11.389 --> 26:13.004
Serenade!

26:13.005 --> 26:14.996
Serenade!

26:14.997 --> 26:16.917
Yeah.

26:21.588 --> 26:22.984
Oh.

26:22.985 --> 26:24.561
Well..

26:24.562 --> 26:26.974
Hope you learned something from
the whole car-buying experience.

26:26.975 --> 26:28.034
Sure did, Dad.

26:28.035 --> 26:30.036
What's that, son?

26:30.037 --> 26:33.368
Can't we just leave it
at a "sure did, Dad"?

26:33.369 --> 26:35.545
I'm talking about the negotiation.

26:35.546 --> 26:37.526
Look..

26:37.634 --> 26:39.683
Someday you're gonna have
a family of your own.

26:39.684 --> 26:41.651
And you're gonna have to buy a new car.

26:41.652 --> 26:46.752
And you know what you're
gonna say to your kid?

26:47.275 --> 26:50.153
The car doesn't fit in the garage?

26:50.154 --> 26:51.561
What?

26:51.562 --> 26:53.596
Then I'll say, "it's not my fault, son."

26:53.597 --> 26:55.418
I learned all this from your grandpa Bob."

26:55.419 --> 26:57.498
And he'll say, "oh, that explains it."

26:57.499 --> 27:01.639
Then we'll laugh and get ice cream.

27:02.706 --> 27:05.406
Well, you asked.

27:08.825 --> 27:11.514
Then everybody was being
really mean to you.

27:11.515 --> 27:14.638
But don't you worry, I
did what I always do.

27:14.639 --> 27:18.719
Fought bravely to make things right.

27:18.896 --> 27:21.668
Charlie, you have the
best Mommy in the world.

27:21.669 --> 27:24.357
Even in a dream.

27:24.358 --> 27:25.672
Charlie?

27:25.673 --> 27:27.099
I made you a special birthday lunch.

27:27.100 --> 27:28.532
It's in the kitchen.

27:28.533 --> 27:30.352
Let's go get it.

27:30.353 --> 27:32.213
Yay.

27:33.259 --> 27:35.271
Okay, um, Mom..

27:35.272 --> 27:37.921
I was just wondering about
Charlie's birthday party.

27:37.922 --> 27:38.826
Oh, honey.

27:38.827 --> 27:40.744
I have to rest.

27:40.745 --> 27:42.831
Would you please take care of that for me?

27:42.832 --> 27:43.956
Yeah, I got it.

27:43.957 --> 27:46.087
Everything you need to know
is in a file in the kitchen.

27:46.088 --> 27:48.188
Got it.

27:48.253 --> 27:51.923
Teddy, you have really been
there for me, and I just..

27:51.924 --> 27:54.895
I'm just so thankful, and..

27:54.896 --> 27:55.724
You're my rock.

27:55.725 --> 27:57.090
I don't know what I'd do without you.

27:57.091 --> 27:59.011
Yeah.

27:59.639 --> 28:00.913
How are the hormones, Mom?

28:00.914 --> 28:03.854
All over the place.

28:10.257 --> 28:15.944
Charlie, how'd you like your
special pony-shaped sandwich?

28:15.945 --> 28:17.021
All right. Well.

28:17.022 --> 28:20.149
Glad I spent an hour cutting it out.

28:20.150 --> 28:21.295
Party folder.

28:21.296 --> 28:23.351
Hey, Charlie, come with me.

28:23.352 --> 28:26.532
Ready? Oh! I got 'cha.

28:27.959 --> 28:29.288
Okay.

28:29.289 --> 28:30.783
What?

28:30.784 --> 28:34.804
Mom forgot to mail the invitations?

28:35.105 --> 28:36.149
Do you know what this means?

28:36.150 --> 28:37.002
No.

28:37.003 --> 28:38.048
Good.

28:38.049 --> 28:41.718
You wait here. I'll be right back.

28:41.719 --> 28:43.520
Dad, hi. Okay.

28:43.521 --> 28:47.320
Big problem.. So you know how Mom's
been kinda spacey with the pregnancy?

28:47.321 --> 28:49.924
Well, she forgot to plan
Charlie's birthday party.

28:49.925 --> 28:51.553
You think you got problems?

28:51.554 --> 28:54.171
The garage is 31 inches too short.

28:54.172 --> 28:56.534
Oh, the garage is too short?

28:56.535 --> 28:57.876
Now it's the garage's fault?

28:57.877 --> 29:00.546
Yeah, car-buying expert
here didn't measure the..

29:00.547 --> 29:02.154
She doesn't need to know the details.

29:02.155 --> 29:03.756
She has her own situation.

29:03.757 --> 29:07.160
Didn't you hear?
Mom made a big, dumb mistake.

29:07.161 --> 29:08.566
Well, so what.. What am I gonna do?

29:08.567 --> 29:10.182
Charlie's in there waiting for her party.

29:10.183 --> 29:12.115
Okay, all right. Give me, uh..

29:12.116 --> 29:13.427
Give me a minute to think.

29:13.428 --> 29:15.805
Uh, bu.. Bu. Bu.. Ba..

29:15.806 --> 29:17.786
Okay..

29:17.902 --> 29:20.413
Give me another minute.

29:20.414 --> 29:21.811
Well, I..

29:21.812 --> 29:23.868
I guess I could try calling
some of Charlie's friends.

29:23.869 --> 29:25.711
See if they can come over.

29:25.712 --> 29:27.349
Pick up a cake at the store..

29:27.350 --> 29:28.847
Before you buy the cake..

29:28.848 --> 29:30.523
You might wanna measure the fridge.

29:30.524 --> 29:34.004
Know what I'm saying, Dad?

29:41.051 --> 29:44.412
Hi uh, Mrs.
Dickson, it's Teddy Duncan calling.

29:44.413 --> 29:45.746
Listen, so I'm throwing together

29:45.747 --> 29:48.349
a little last-minute
birthday party for Charlie,

29:48.350 --> 29:52.386
and I was just wondering
if Megan could come.

29:52.387 --> 29:54.545
Oh. Chicken pox.

29:54.546 --> 29:56.683
Poor little thing.

29:56.684 --> 30:01.395
But, you know, she doesn't
have to stay for long.

30:01.396 --> 30:02.873
Okay.

30:02.874 --> 30:03.959
Okay, I understand.

30:03.960 --> 30:05.366
Oh, you know what?

30:05.367 --> 30:07.243
As long as I've got you..

30:07.244 --> 30:09.771
Is there any chance that Mr. Dickson is a..

30:09.772 --> 30:13.552
Is a clown or a magician, or..

30:15.020 --> 30:17.000
Hello?

30:20.516 --> 30:23.265
Hi um, is this Cake World?

30:23.266 --> 30:24.479
Yeah, yeah, hi.

30:24.480 --> 30:27.150
I need a cake. Um..

30:27.151 --> 30:29.822
You're out of cake?

30:29.823 --> 30:32.052
You realize you're called "Cake World."

30:32.053 --> 30:36.464
Which means, right now,
you're just "world."

30:36.465 --> 30:41.445
Yeah, well, I don't like
your attitude, either.

30:41.470 --> 30:43.450
Hello?

30:47.278 --> 30:50.947
Hi, uh.. Hi, is this
"Al's Amazing Animals"?

30:50.948 --> 30:53.976
Yeah um, listen, I know
that it's last minute,

30:53.977 --> 30:56.853
but I'm trying to put
together this birthday party.

30:56.854 --> 31:01.474
What's the most amazing animal you've got?

31:01.872 --> 31:04.868
A monkey who does tricks for cake.

31:04.869 --> 31:06.933
Yeah, we're gonna have a problem.

31:06.934 --> 31:09.387
Um, by any chance..

31:09.388 --> 31:13.768
Does the monkey come with its own cake?

31:15.370 --> 31:17.350
Hello?

31:18.955 --> 31:22.004
Who's coming to my party?

31:22.005 --> 31:24.575
You know, I'm really not sure.

31:24.576 --> 31:27.234
Hey, you know who might be
fun to have at your party?

31:27.235 --> 31:28.037
Who?

31:28.038 --> 31:29.904
The kids from the playground.

31:29.905 --> 31:31.765
Yay!

31:32.745 --> 31:33.821
What kids?

31:33.822 --> 31:36.293
Well, we won't know until we get there.

31:36.294 --> 31:38.154
Yay!

31:38.548 --> 31:40.708
Woo-hoo!

31:45.345 --> 31:46.941
Okay, that's as far as I can go.

31:46.942 --> 31:48.099
How's she looking?

31:48.100 --> 31:49.411
It's a she?

31:49.412 --> 31:52.232
How can you tell?

31:52.764 --> 31:55.438
Could you just press the button?

31:55.439 --> 31:58.739
All right, here it goes.

32:03.414 --> 32:05.376
Looking good.

32:05.377 --> 32:07.837
Looking good.

32:13.267 --> 32:15.487
So close.

32:22.197 --> 32:23.871
Hm.

32:23.872 --> 32:25.660
PJ was right.

32:25.661 --> 32:30.581
The squares aren't as
much fun as the sticks.

32:31.886 --> 32:36.026
But I'm gonna eat some more anyway.

32:39.793 --> 32:41.536
So, what are you gonna do?

32:41.537 --> 32:44.076
Well, what choice do I have?
I have to tell my Dad the truth.

32:44.077 --> 32:48.190
The truth?
Dude, that game messed you up.

32:48.191 --> 32:49.821
You know, if you came in and
shared some of the blame,

32:49.822 --> 32:53.142
they'd probably go easier on me.

32:53.143 --> 32:56.383
Guess we'll never know.

32:56.465 --> 32:58.038
Gotta admit..

32:58.039 --> 33:01.399
I like that kid's style.

33:06.056 --> 33:10.424
Okay, you. You stay right where you are.

33:10.425 --> 33:13.245
Little more. Stop!

33:15.098 --> 33:17.099
Little more.

33:17.100 --> 33:19.020
Stop!

33:22.313 --> 33:23.355
Little more.

33:23.356 --> 33:24.714
Stop!

33:24.715 --> 33:26.605
Okay.

33:26.606 --> 33:28.981
We're getting there.

33:28.982 --> 33:30.015
No, we're not!

33:30.016 --> 33:31.173
This is ridiculous.

33:31.174 --> 33:32.320
Dad, calm down.

33:32.321 --> 33:33.584
No, that's it! That's it!

33:33.585 --> 33:35.498
I'm done. Done!

33:35.499 --> 33:39.759
Taking this tank back to the.. Dealer!

33:47.054 --> 33:49.934
Dealer's that way.

33:56.030 --> 33:58.070
Uh-oh.

34:09.918 --> 34:11.896
Oh! Oh!

34:11.897 --> 34:15.838
It looks bad from this side, too.

34:15.839 --> 34:18.438
Dad, I have to tell you some..

34:18.440 --> 34:20.643
It can wait.

34:20.643 --> 34:22.295
Uh-oh.

34:22.295 --> 34:23.248
Hey, Dad.

34:23.248 --> 34:24.545
Great news.

34:24.547 --> 34:27.427
Garage door closes.

34:27.784 --> 34:30.342
Guys, Charlie's birthday party is..

34:30.344 --> 34:33.583
Not our biggest problem.

34:33.612 --> 34:35.195
Uh-oh.

34:35.196 --> 34:36.554
Why do you keep saying, "uh-oh"?

34:36.556 --> 34:38.389
Why do you think?

34:38.389 --> 34:39.476
The baby's coming.

34:39.476 --> 34:40.456
- Oh!
- Okay, all right.

34:40.458 --> 34:41.922
We gotta get Mom to the hospital.

34:41.922 --> 34:43.023
Come on, honey. Get in the car.

34:43.024 --> 34:46.161
Car's in the wall, Bob.

34:46.161 --> 34:47.697
Come on, I'll drive. Ed's out front.

34:47.699 --> 34:48.926
Ed? Who's Ed?

34:48.927 --> 34:50.132
That's the name of my car.

34:50.134 --> 34:52.783
Ed? So is that short for uh, Edward?

34:52.784 --> 34:53.969
Edgar? Edwin?

34:53.969 --> 34:56.553
- Ed.. Ed..
- Bigger issues, PJ!

34:56.554 --> 34:58.364
Okay, we really need to go.

34:58.365 --> 35:00.682
Okay, come on.

35:00.683 --> 35:02.875
You guys have to throw
Charlie her birthday party.

35:02.876 --> 35:04.500
I'm gonna drive Mom to the hospital.

35:04.501 --> 35:08.664
Oh, why do we always get the hard things?

35:08.665 --> 35:10.584
You know..

35:10.585 --> 35:15.131
I always thought you would be the first
one to drive a car into the kitchen.

35:15.132 --> 35:17.292
Me, too.

35:22.100 --> 35:24.321
Hey, how you doing, honey?

35:24.322 --> 35:26.891
It'd be a lot better if you were quiet!

35:26.892 --> 35:28.712
She wants me to be quiet.

35:28.713 --> 35:32.208
Gotta be quiet. Why can't I be quiet?

35:32.209 --> 35:34.617
Dad, were you this panicky
when the rest of us were born?

35:34.618 --> 35:36.170
Uh.. No.

35:36.171 --> 35:40.943
Because the first four times we
did this, we were at a hospital!

35:40.944 --> 35:42.417
We did this, yeah.

35:42.418 --> 35:45.329
Yeah, you wanna take over?!

35:45.330 --> 35:47.016
Okay, everybody relax.

35:47.017 --> 35:50.611
We're on our way.
We're gonna be there shortly.

35:50.612 --> 35:54.392
Right after this.. Slight delay.

35:55.608 --> 35:57.363
You're outta gas.

35:57.364 --> 35:59.419
You're outta gas! Aw, Teddy.

35:59.420 --> 36:01.386
How could you be so irresponsible?!

36:01.387 --> 36:06.367
Says the guy who drove a
car into our kitchen.

36:08.730 --> 36:10.732
Close your eyes. There you go.

36:10.733 --> 36:12.653
Okay.

36:12.696 --> 36:14.676
Ready?

36:14.739 --> 36:15.862
Keep 'em closed.

36:15.863 --> 36:18.863
Okay. And.. Surprise!

36:19.260 --> 36:20.326
Hey!

36:20.327 --> 36:22.811
Look who came to your party, Charlie.

36:22.812 --> 36:25.764
Three of your oldest and bestest friends.

36:25.765 --> 36:27.154
Aw.

36:27.155 --> 36:30.155
Tennis ball head. Aw.

36:30.156 --> 36:31.312
Scary clown.

36:31.313 --> 36:33.113
Ah!

36:33.914 --> 36:35.834
And..

36:37.095 --> 36:40.095
Badly-damaged monkey.

36:40.992 --> 36:43.416
I.. I don't think she likes it.

36:43.417 --> 36:45.038
Well, she's.. She's about to.

36:45.039 --> 36:47.887
- Oh, okay.
- Because..

36:47.888 --> 36:49.080
Ta-da!

36:49.081 --> 36:51.031
Happy Birthday!

36:51.032 --> 36:52.866
It's your special birthday cake.

36:52.867 --> 36:55.035
That's not cake.

36:55.036 --> 36:58.936
It's your special birthday bagel.

36:59.377 --> 37:02.157
Mm, bagel. Tennis ball head's. Favorite.

37:02.158 --> 37:04.864
Mm. Yum, yum, yum.

37:04.865 --> 37:06.519
Where's my present?

37:06.520 --> 37:08.773
Yeah, did you get the Kuddle Me Katie doll?

37:08.774 --> 37:12.561
What is this, "60 minutes"?
Just enjoy the party.

37:12.562 --> 37:16.614
Charlie.. We have got some
really fun party games planned.

37:16.615 --> 37:18.220
Like..

37:18.221 --> 37:19.364
Watching TV!

37:19.365 --> 37:21.225
Yay!

37:21.930 --> 37:23.867
I want princesses.

37:23.868 --> 37:25.269
Really?

37:25.270 --> 37:27.180
Uh, did Mommy promise you a Princess?

37:27.181 --> 37:31.261
Mommy said, "two princesses, please."

37:31.445 --> 37:33.841
All right, you heard her, Princess.

37:33.842 --> 37:35.521
Make it happen.

37:35.522 --> 37:38.162
Mommy said two.

37:41.663 --> 37:43.535
Just breathe.

37:43.536 --> 37:44.927
I'm sure Dad will find us a ride soon.

37:44.928 --> 37:49.188
Yeah, because he's so good with cars?

37:49.798 --> 37:51.992
Hey, sorry it took so long.

37:51.993 --> 37:54.581
You went for ice cream at a time like this?

37:54.582 --> 37:55.939
Uh, well..

37:55.940 --> 38:00.020
Actually, the ice cream came to me.

38:03.521 --> 38:06.040
You're taking me to the
hospital in an ice cream truck?

38:06.041 --> 38:08.505
You said to flag down
the first thing I saw.

38:08.506 --> 38:10.944
Oh what's the matter, the
giant hot dog wouldn't stop?

38:10.945 --> 38:12.569
Yeah.

38:12.570 --> 38:14.490
Okay.

38:14.605 --> 38:17.005
Push, Teddy.

38:17.754 --> 38:22.211
Welcome aboard Mustachio Pete's, the ice
cream truck with the pistachio treats.

38:22.212 --> 38:26.102
FYI, pistachio has been discontinued.

38:26.103 --> 38:27.547
Bob, I need to lie down.

38:27.548 --> 38:29.326
- Okay.
- You can use that bean bag chair.

38:29.327 --> 38:31.901
It's where Mustachio Pete
takes his 10 minute breaks..

38:31.902 --> 38:35.028
Which Mustachio Pete is allowed by law.

38:35.029 --> 38:37.660
You're not gonna keep referring to
yourself in the third person, are you?

38:37.661 --> 38:39.844
Yes, he is.

38:39.845 --> 38:41.819
That's Mustachio Pete's trademark.

38:41.820 --> 38:44.340
That, and the pistachio, which, FYI..

38:44.341 --> 38:45.833
Has been discontinued.

38:45.834 --> 38:49.783
We get.. We.. Okay. Come on, honey.

38:49.784 --> 38:53.221
If things get bad back there,
bite down on a rocket pop.

38:53.222 --> 38:54.754
Ooh, cool, I will.

38:54.755 --> 38:56.808
He meant me!

38:56.809 --> 38:58.543
Can we get going? It's an emergency.

38:58.544 --> 38:59.720
Emergency?

38:59.721 --> 39:03.861
This calls for the fast-paced music.

39:21.052 --> 39:22.244
Ready, Charlie?

39:22.245 --> 39:25.185
It's Princess time!

39:36.446 --> 39:38.068
Uh-oh.

39:38.069 --> 39:40.946
I seem to have lost my sister Princess.

39:40.947 --> 39:43.227
Excuse me.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.664
- Get out there!
- But I feel stupid!

39:45.665 --> 39:47.370
- You think I don't?
- You're used to it!

39:47.371 --> 39:49.171
Go!

39:53.527 --> 39:55.514
Dance, Princess.

39:55.515 --> 39:58.275
Left.. And right.

39:59.389 --> 40:01.804
And we cast a spell.

40:01.805 --> 40:04.567
And we twirl and we twirl.

40:04.568 --> 40:07.148
And we curtsy!

40:07.832 --> 40:08.981
Aw.

40:08.982 --> 40:10.257
Look at that smile.

40:10.258 --> 40:11.921
We gotta go again.

40:11.922 --> 40:12.790
What?

40:12.791 --> 40:16.451
But, this time, stay with me.

40:16.849 --> 40:18.623
And five, six, seven, eight.

40:18.624 --> 40:21.084
Left, right..

40:21.268 --> 40:22.814
Can't you go any faster?

40:22.815 --> 40:24.833
We're already doing 23.

40:24.834 --> 40:28.315
I'm giving her all she's got.

40:28.316 --> 40:29.230
Okay.

40:29.231 --> 40:30.710
Baby's close. How much further?

40:30.711 --> 40:34.100
You're not helping yourself to any
freebies back there, are you, Bob?

40:34.101 --> 40:36.112
I'm a stress eater, Pete.

40:36.113 --> 40:38.762
You don't have to tell me about stress.

40:38.763 --> 40:41.678
The ice cream truck
business is dog-eat-dog.

40:41.679 --> 40:45.226
I got Side Burn Sam nipping at my heels.

40:45.227 --> 40:48.512
Could we just focus on the road, Pete?

40:48.513 --> 40:51.942
But both princesses are so beautiful.

40:51.943 --> 40:57.043
How could I ever choose
just one to be my wife?

40:57.346 --> 40:58.768
Dude, that's your line.

40:58.769 --> 41:00.356
Oh, right.

41:00.357 --> 41:02.749
Well, I guess there's only one way.

41:02.750 --> 41:05.837
See whose foot fits the magic slipper.

41:05.838 --> 41:07.758
Okay.

41:13.064 --> 41:17.744
'Tis not I whose foot doth fit the slipper.

41:18.103 --> 41:20.581
Yes, 'tis not me, either.

41:20.582 --> 41:24.856
But, sister Princess, you have
not tried on the slipper.

41:24.857 --> 41:27.011
I doth not want to.

41:27.012 --> 41:29.507
Oh, yeth you will.

41:29.508 --> 41:31.401
Or I will hurteth you.

41:31.402 --> 41:33.982
With my fitht.

41:39.719 --> 41:41.125
Oh, joy.

41:41.126 --> 41:43.286
It fits.

41:43.780 --> 41:45.389
My bride!

41:45.390 --> 41:48.655
At long last I have found you.

41:48.656 --> 41:53.036
And they seal their love.. With a kiss.

41:55.206 --> 41:56.859
- Okay, we're done!
- Bah!

41:56.860 --> 41:58.694
Yeah, not quite.

41:58.695 --> 42:00.798
We're gonna go again from the top.

42:00.799 --> 42:04.999
Maybe you'll get it right this time.

42:06.069 --> 42:07.869
Ah!

42:09.404 --> 42:11.294
Hey..

42:11.295 --> 42:12.821
I'm gonna need your help back here.

42:12.822 --> 42:14.962
Dad, I don't know how to deliver a baby.

42:14.963 --> 42:17.664
Honey, you just gotta help me.

42:17.665 --> 42:21.565
All alone back here! Just sayin'.

42:22.392 --> 42:24.312
Okay.

42:29.209 --> 42:30.905
- How you doing, Mom?
- Hey.

42:30.906 --> 42:33.967
This baby is coming now.

42:33.968 --> 42:35.398
Then..

42:35.399 --> 42:36.973
Let's have a baby.

42:36.974 --> 42:38.902
Okay, Teddy.

42:38.903 --> 42:41.303
Here we go.

42:47.192 --> 42:49.126
Oh, wow.

42:49.127 --> 42:52.427
Well, hello, number five.

42:52.477 --> 42:54.795
What a beautiful baby boy.

42:54.796 --> 42:56.166
Aw.

42:56.167 --> 42:59.047
Isn't he precious?

42:59.425 --> 43:01.106
We got here as fast as we could.

43:01.107 --> 43:01.813
Hi.

43:01.814 --> 43:03.825
There's the birthday girl.

43:03.826 --> 43:05.812
Happy Birthday.

43:05.813 --> 43:07.963
Charlie, come here.

43:07.964 --> 43:10.627
Meet your new baby brother.

43:10.628 --> 43:11.969
Brother?

43:11.970 --> 43:13.322
Cool.

43:13.323 --> 43:14.451
Hey, what name did you pick?

43:14.452 --> 43:17.165
Well, we decided to call him..

43:17.166 --> 43:19.086
Toby.

43:19.142 --> 43:19.931
Hey.

43:19.932 --> 43:22.969
I came up with that one. Nice.

43:22.970 --> 43:26.930
Welcome to the world, Toby Duncan.

43:27.815 --> 43:30.396
Hey, quick question.

43:30.397 --> 43:34.188
Why are you guys dressed like that?

43:34.189 --> 43:35.487
Oh, because..

43:35.488 --> 43:37.867
Mom promised Charlie
princesses for her party.

43:37.868 --> 43:41.888
I never promised Charlie princesses.

43:42.839 --> 43:46.259
Charlie, did you trick us?

43:47.606 --> 43:51.682
Sweetie, did you get your special
birthday present, Kuddle Me Katie?

43:51.683 --> 43:52.920
No, Mommy.

43:52.921 --> 43:54.823
What? Why not?

43:54.824 --> 43:55.884
Bob?

43:55.885 --> 43:57.164
Gabe?

43:57.165 --> 43:57.995
PJ?

43:57.996 --> 43:58.801
Teddy?

43:58.802 --> 44:00.722
Gabe?

44:01.648 --> 44:03.324
Oh.

44:03.325 --> 44:05.625
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

44:05.626 --> 44:07.539
Wasn't much of a birthday, was it?

44:07.540 --> 44:10.146
That's okay, Mommy.

44:10.147 --> 44:12.943
Now, don't you worry.
We will get you your special present.

44:12.944 --> 44:15.944
I like this present.

44:23.873 --> 44:25.702
Okay, listen up. Here's the plan.

44:25.703 --> 44:28.620
So, when they come through
the front door, you guys..

44:28.621 --> 44:31.517
Are gonna hold up this banner.

44:31.518 --> 44:33.613
Here. Take that.

44:33.614 --> 44:35.693
And Charlie, you're gonna
give Mommy these balloons.

44:35.694 --> 44:37.200
And I'm gonna blow the noisemaker.

44:37.201 --> 44:39.640
And then we're all gonna
sing "welcome home, Toby"

44:39.641 --> 44:43.407
To the tune of the rock classic..
"Our House."

44:43.408 --> 44:44.854
Why do you get to blow the noisemaker?

44:44.855 --> 44:46.458
And why are we making such
a big deal outta this?

44:46.459 --> 44:48.232
They bring a new baby home
like every six months.

44:48.233 --> 44:50.153
Yeah.

44:50.200 --> 44:51.412
This is what we always do.

44:51.413 --> 44:52.514
We did it for Charlie.

44:52.515 --> 44:53.532
Did you do it for me?

44:53.533 --> 44:55.813
Uh.. Yeah.

44:56.753 --> 44:57.887
- You're lying!
- No, I'm not.

44:57.888 --> 45:00.468
Yeah, you are.

45:02.055 --> 45:06.025
You.. You know what? If you didn't do
it for me, I'm not doing it for Toby.

45:06.026 --> 45:09.095
No matter how cool his name is.

45:09.096 --> 45:11.329
Gabe, just pick up the stupid banner

45:11.330 --> 45:15.146
and join in this very
touching family celebration!

45:15.147 --> 45:16.023
You can't make me.

45:16.024 --> 45:17.889
Well, if he's not gonna do
it, I'm not gonna do it.

45:17.890 --> 45:19.607
And if we not all gonna do it together..

45:19.608 --> 45:24.348
.. It looks like Charlie
could have made it.

45:26.174 --> 45:28.934
Good to be home.

45:30.830 --> 45:36.230
This is what it's all about, isn't it?
Now I see..

45:37.862 --> 45:40.663
So let me show you around.

45:40.664 --> 45:44.384
This is your home, Toby. Yeah.

45:44.773 --> 45:48.073
This is the living room.

45:52.485 --> 45:54.839
And this is your family.

45:54.840 --> 45:58.260
<i>Tell me who's your angel.</i>

45:58.942 --> 46:03.622
<i>Who's your shoulder, to
hold your boulders.</i>

46:05.460 --> 46:08.940
<i>Tell me when it's raining.</i>

46:09.534 --> 46:12.188
<i>Who will warm you.</i>

46:12.189 --> 46:15.069
<i>Who will hold you.</i>

46:15.460 --> 46:16.916
<i>You might be broken.</i>

46:16.917 --> 46:20.859
<i>With all these cracks in your skin.</i>

46:20.860 --> 46:25.263
<i>You might be broken that's
where the light gets in.</i>

46:25.264 --> 46:30.184
<i>You're something beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful.</i>

46:30.480 --> 46:35.400
<i>You're something beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful.</i>

46:35.870 --> 46:41.233
<i>And I just want you to know.
You to know. You to know.</i>

46:41.234 --> 46:43.867
<i>That you're not alone.</i>

46:43.868 --> 46:46.688
<i>You're not alone.</i>

46:52.330 --> 46:55.072
Hey, what you doing?

46:55.073 --> 46:59.033
Giving Toby a proper welcome home.

47:04.285 --> 47:07.926
Well, Charlie, it's been
kind of a big week.

47:07.927 --> 47:10.122
I uh, I helped deliver a baby..

47:10.123 --> 47:11.729
Our little brother, Toby..

47:11.730 --> 47:16.230
And you finally got your Kuddle Me Katie.

47:17.980 --> 47:21.320
Which you lost interest in
five minutes after you got it.

47:21.321 --> 47:23.169
Doesn't matter, Gabe's still paying for it.

47:23.170 --> 47:25.824
He worked out a little
agreement with Mom and Dad.

47:25.825 --> 47:28.659
Gabe! Diaper change!

47:28.660 --> 47:30.338
And it's a doozy.

47:30.339 --> 47:32.379
Coming.

47:39.049 --> 47:42.589
Wish him good luck, Charlie.

47:43.039 --> 47:44.548
Isn't he adorable?

47:44.549 --> 47:46.577
Oh, little Toby.

47:46.578 --> 47:48.104
He sure is.

47:48.105 --> 47:50.096
Oh, by the way, what's his middle name?

47:50.097 --> 47:52.437
Wan-Kenobi.

47:54.298 --> 47:56.588
Toby Wan-Kenobi?

47:56.589 --> 48:00.448
Yeah.
Yup, your Dad's a big fan of the movies.

48:00.449 --> 48:01.901
Speaking of, where is Dad?

48:01.902 --> 48:03.324
I'm ready to go home.

48:03.325 --> 48:08.202
He said he was just going
to pull the car up.

48:08.203 --> 48:10.229
Here he is now.

48:10.230 --> 48:12.500
Hey! Ready to go hun?

48:12.501 --> 48:14.748
Yes, babe how did you do that?

48:14.749 --> 48:17.275
We're on the eighth floor.

48:17.276 --> 48:19.143
Hey, this baby's got some pick-up.

48:19.144 --> 48:20.336
