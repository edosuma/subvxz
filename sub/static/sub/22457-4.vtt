00:27.520 --> 00:31.229
So, Soph, do you fancy coming along
to my school reunion on Saturday?

00:31.280 --> 00:33.919
School reunion?
That doesn't sound very you.

00:33.960 --> 00:37.191
Yeah, but I thought it might
be nice to go and, you know,

00:37.240 --> 00:41.358
show them all that I've got a job
and a flat and a fiancee now

00:41.400 --> 00:47.032
and I'm not in fact a gender bender,
a mentaloid or a public leaning post, after all.

00:48.200 --> 00:52.557
Right, OK,
the thing is, er, the thing...

00:52.600 --> 00:55.239
I think I mentioned I'll be
heading off late Saturday night.

00:55.280 --> 00:57.475
- What thing?
- Frankfurt,

00:57.520 --> 01:00.671
marketing development group,
me and Alan and Lisa and Jeff.

01:00.720 --> 01:03.712
Jeff? You're going to Frankfurt
with your ex?

01:03.760 --> 01:07.639
Not with him, it's work, Mark.
Did I not mention it?

01:07.680 --> 01:09.955
No, no, no, you did not mention it.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.468
Oh, well, I thought you knew.
Well, you do now, so...

01:12.520 --> 01:14.988
I know now, but I didn't before.

01:15.040 --> 01:17.838
- Well, you do now, so...
- Right.

01:17.880 --> 01:21.475
'OK, definitely have a legitimate
grievance here, I reckon.

01:21.520 --> 01:22.919
'Let's milk it.'

01:24.560 --> 01:29.918
Mark, Jeff and I aren't going to fall into
each other's arms in a pile of sauerkraut.

01:29.960 --> 01:33.270

- Yes, sure.</i>

01:33.320 --> 01:37.074

Sally Slater might be there.

01:47.640 --> 01:50.632

cos I'm not gonna tell her.'

'Gotta say something.'

02:08.720 --> 02:10.995
So, how do you know everyone?

02:11.039 --> 02:13.395
I'm a friend of Bob's mate, Kev,

02:13.440 --> 02:17.831
and he said it was a friendly crowd
and come down. So, I thought, yeah.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.108
Cool.

02:19.160 --> 02:22.357
'Jesus! Come on, throw me a bone! '

02:22.400 --> 02:26.279
So, have you got any plans
for the weekend?

02:26.320 --> 02:29.232
- I'm doing a gig, actually.
- Oh, right.

02:29.280 --> 02:32.670
Playing with my old outfit
as The Orgazoid.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.917
You're The Orgazoid?! Oh, my God!
You're the...!

02:35.960 --> 02:39.839
I thought you were just a man
in a shirt, sitting on a chair.

02:39.880 --> 02:42.519
Your first two CDs, I know every track.

02:42.560 --> 02:44.118
<i>Nnn-j nn-j-j Nn-j-jn</i>

02:44.160 --> 02:46.833

02:49.040 --> 02:51.270
Right. Nice.

02:51.320 --> 02:55.598
Hans, this is... this... It's not
just a man, this is The Orgazoid!

02:55.640 --> 02:58.234
- Yeah, I know.
- Well, why didn't you say?

02:58.280 --> 02:59.793
Can I get you a drink?

02:59.840 --> 03:02.115
I'm full of Diet Coke here, man.

03:02.160 --> 03:05.038
I haven't had a proper drink for six years.

03:05.080 --> 03:07.275
None of the party powder either.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.959
Oh, right. I mean, you've been
as high as it's possible to go.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.878
Well, yeah, yeah, I suppose I have.

03:12.920 --> 03:14.956
And you've been as low
as it's possible to get.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.831
Yeah, yeah, I have.

03:16.880 --> 03:18.871
And what's it like
when you're up that high?

03:18.920 --> 03:21.354
Ha, it's incredible!

03:21.400 --> 03:23.231
And what's it like
when you're down that low?

03:23.280 --> 03:25.794
Ah, it's terrible, it's horrible.

03:25.840 --> 03:30.038
And what's it like
when you're in the middle?

03:30.080 --> 03:31.832
It's, you know, it's fine.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.757
Wow!

03:33.800 --> 03:38.920
So, listen, a weird question. I'm not sure
if you're looking for work or what,

03:38.960 --> 03:41.520
but I'm looking for
a kind of, like, handyman.

03:41.560 --> 03:44.518
My place is going to shit
since I split up with my ex.

03:44.560 --> 03:47.597
Well, that sounds amazing!

03:47.640 --> 03:50.950
'Orgazoid's handyman.
This is a dream come true!

03:51.000 --> 03:55.312
'Handyman to chauffeur to keyboard player,
it's a very well established career path.'

03:56.960 --> 03:59.872
Oh, man, my job is the nuts!

03:59.920 --> 04:01.592
I had a great first day.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.074
By your job,
you mean being a handyman

04:04.120 --> 04:06.111
for a man called The Orgazoid.

04:06.160 --> 04:10.278
He's not a man, he's a band. He's one of
the most brilliant techno pioneers of all time

04:10.320 --> 04:13.198
and he's paying me 500 quid a week
in advance, in cash.

04:13.240 --> 04:17.870
What?! Come on, Jeremy, nobody
gets paid Â£500 a week to do nothing.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.753
It's not nothing. Making smoothies
from a smoothie maker

04:20.800 --> 04:22.870
is not nothing. You should try
cleaning one of those mothers.

04:22.920 --> 04:25.832
There's gotta be a catch.
You're gonna be his drugs mule.

04:25.880 --> 04:29.793
He's gonna sell your organs or invite
a German round from the internet to eat you.

04:29.840 --> 04:32.195
I mean, where did you even meet him?

04:32.240 --> 04:34.071
The Snooker Club that
used to be a public toilet?

04:34.120 --> 04:36.350
I'm concerned
about this arrangement.

04:36.400 --> 04:39.836
Why does everything good have to be
some horrible arrangement?

04:39.880 --> 04:43.316
Me and Russell are just
two guys having a nice time.

04:43.360 --> 04:45.590
That's what life is supposed to be like,
in case you've forgotten.

04:45.640 --> 04:47.471
All right, whatever.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.431
Look, I'm going out, so...

04:49.480 --> 04:50.469
Going out?!

04:50.520 --> 04:53.114
'What? He's not going out, he can't.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.639
'He doesn't know how! '

04:54.680 --> 04:58.673
- Where? Who with?
- Just to a nightclub.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.233
A nightclub?

05:00.280 --> 05:02.236
Yes. Well, as you're always saying,

05:02.280 --> 05:06.671
The Beastie Boys fought and possibly
died for my right to party, so...

05:06.720 --> 05:08.790
Mark, come on, what the hell's going on?

05:08.840 --> 05:11.195
All right, look I've been invited

05:11.240 --> 05:14.277
to the Polefield School Reunion
at a school disco club and...

05:14.320 --> 05:15.878
But they all hated you at Polefield.

05:15.920 --> 05:19.356
Well, the vast majority, but there
were some crumbs of comfort -

05:19.400 --> 05:23.552
the chess players, the musicians,
the poor and the posh-voiced.

05:23.600 --> 05:26.160
We formed a sub-strata, a secret society

05:26.200 --> 05:28.873
- below the radar of the norms.
- The norms?

05:28.920 --> 05:32.196
The normallows,
the Norman forces, our oppressors.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.470
Right, well, this I have got to see.

05:34.520 --> 05:37.876
I could invite Nancy.
Yeah, brilliant excuse to see her.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.319
Haven't you got work in the morning?

05:39.360 --> 05:41.954
Oh, yeah,
that's really gonna break his balls,

05:42.000 --> 05:45.151
if I roll in an hour late.
Mark, this is Russell Orgazoid,

05:45.200 --> 05:46.997
he's a creative, I'm a creative.

05:47.040 --> 05:48.792
We don't make steam engines

05:48.840 --> 05:50.717
out of pig iron in this country
any more, yeah?

05:50.760 --> 05:53.752
We hang out,
we fuck around on the PlayStation,

05:53.800 --> 05:57.839
we have some Ben and Jerry's, that's how
everyone makes their money now, yeah?

05:59.520 --> 06:02.830
Here they all are, my tormentors.

06:02.880 --> 06:05.269
I hope Nancy gets here soon,
this is gonna be perfect.

06:05.320 --> 06:06.833
She won't know anyone except me.

06:06.880 --> 06:09.314
That's Faizel Butt.

06:09.360 --> 06:13.797
He used to call me a flod. I think it was
a mixture between a flid and spod.

06:15.080 --> 06:18.277
That's Foz.
He used to sit behind me in French

06:18.320 --> 06:20.470
and put bacon on my shoulders.

06:20.520 --> 06:25.992
That's Terry Carpenter,
one of the more sophisticated bullies.

06:26.040 --> 06:30.795
Pretended I was Thatcher and he was
Heseltine and that I needed ousting.

06:30.840 --> 06:33.115
I need a drink.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.479
(Mark) 'Oh, my God!

06:34.520 --> 06:37.193
'There she is - lovely Sally Slater.

06:37.240 --> 06:41.028
'I should speak to her,
but what the hell can I say?

06:41.080 --> 06:45.278
'Anything that doesn't mention I masturbate
over her memory is probably good.

06:45.320 --> 06:48.790
'I think that's a compliment, but women
just don't seem to want to hear it.

06:48.840 --> 06:53.038
'No, just spend the evening
looking longingly at her from a distance,

06:53.080 --> 06:54.479
'like the good old days.'

06:54.520 --> 06:57.239
Mark! Is it Mark Corrigan?

06:57.280 --> 07:02.354
Yeah... I forget, are you... Sally?
Good to see you.

07:02.400 --> 07:06.154
I have a job and a flat of my own now,
so it's great to see you.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.111
God, you look great!

07:08.160 --> 07:11.516
Thanks. So, listen,
can I get you a drink?

07:11.560 --> 07:13.710
OK, great!

07:13.760 --> 07:18.390
'Maybe everything will be different now.
Maybe all the parameters have shifted.

07:18.440 --> 07:22.513
'Most of my rivals from school have
probably perished in Blair's oil wars.'

07:22.560 --> 07:24.471
(Jez) Hey, Nancy!

07:24.520 --> 07:28.069
Hey, Jez! Great idea.
This is so much fun.

07:28.120 --> 07:30.236
Come here and meet these great guys.

07:30.280 --> 07:32.840
'She made some friends
pretty fucking quick! '

07:34.920 --> 07:40.438
So now I'm finally doing an English degree
and I do a bit of cleaning to pay the bills.

07:40.480 --> 07:43.472
I listen to the set text on my iPod
when I'm hoovering.

07:43.520 --> 07:45.158
Right, that's cool.

07:45.200 --> 07:48.715
I hoover sometimes
cos I bought my flat and that

07:48.760 --> 07:52.309
and from my job as an executive I had
plenty of cash leftover to buy a hoover.

07:52.360 --> 07:57.115
- Are you boasting, Corrigan?
- No! I mean, maybe a bit.

07:57.160 --> 07:59.594
Do you remember on that history field trip,

07:59.640 --> 08:05.397
where you borrowed my Hitchhiker's Guide
and we both read it out in funny voices?

08:05.440 --> 08:12.312
I was thinking that was probably
one of the best days of my life.

08:12.360 --> 08:13.952
What, really?

08:14.000 --> 08:18.118
'Should I feel guilty? No,
Sophie's probably doing it with Jeff

08:18.160 --> 08:20.720
'to the brutal rhythm of the oompah band.

08:20.760 --> 08:26.517
'Why shouldn't I have some mild
flirtation, a snog even, or more? '

08:26.560 --> 08:27.549
Hello, sexy.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.955
'Oh, great, bacon shoulders.'

08:30.000 --> 08:31.638
Mark, you remember Foz?

08:31.680 --> 08:32.908
All right, Corrigan.

08:32.960 --> 08:34.393
Hi, Foz.

08:34.440 --> 08:36.908
'Please don't hit me for any reason, Foz.'

08:36.960 --> 08:39.679
- Foz and I are married now.
- Oh, right. Great.

08:39.720 --> 08:44.316
'Obviously! Of course! Why didn't I just
buy an anvil and smash my face onto it?

08:44.360 --> 08:45.793
'It'd certainly be less hassle.'

08:45.840 --> 08:47.796
So, have you got kids?

08:47.840 --> 08:49.637
Not yet, why?

08:49.680 --> 08:55.630
Oh, no reason. I mean, I love kids.
Not in a bad way, in a nice way.

08:55.680 --> 08:59.992
I mean, I'm not on
the Child Protection Register... yet,

09:00.040 --> 09:01.758
which proves I'm not a paedo.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.030
'This is going horribly! Need a joke.'

09:04.080 --> 09:08.039
Either that or I'm an incredibly
hard-to-detect paedo.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.594
'Just move on from the paedo area entirely! '

09:10.640 --> 09:15.760
Jez, this is Foz and Sally. Jeremy.

09:15.800 --> 09:19.236
All right, mate.
So, you're mates with Wankerthon?

09:19.280 --> 09:21.999
- I'm sorry?
- Mark Wankerthon, you remember?

09:22.040 --> 09:27.319
At school? You got taught the wrong way
to rub one out and you tried it for two hours.

09:27.360 --> 09:30.158
(Jez) 'Shit, this is just like school.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.839
'Have to side with the powerful to survive.'

09:32.880 --> 09:34.552
Two hours!

09:34.600 --> 09:37.068
<i>I'm too sexy for my love...</i>

09:37.120 --> 09:40.112
Oh, I fucking hate this track.
It's brilliant. Come on, saucepot.

09:40.160 --> 09:43.357
(Mark) 'Eugh, just like school.
I have to sit and watch

09:43.400 --> 09:46.153
'while the beautiful people
dance at me, except...

09:46.200 --> 09:48.634
'No, she wants me to call her!

09:48.680 --> 09:50.875
'It's worked! All my references
to how much above

09:50.920 --> 09:54.230
'the national average income
I earn have actually worked! '

09:56.840 --> 10:00.310
'Oh, yeah, making smoothies
at the Orgazoid's house!

10:00.360 --> 10:03.750
'This is the kind of job I deserve.
I've paid my dues, all those years

10:03.800 --> 10:06.394
'signing on, every bloody week.'

10:06.440 --> 10:08.112
Ah, nice. Thanks, man.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.833
Yeah, take five, if you want.
Swim a few lengths.

10:10.880 --> 10:13.872
Oh. Cheers, Russell.
Yeah, maybe I will.

10:13.920 --> 10:18.232
'Nothing dodgy about this,
just going for a swim in my trunks.

10:18.280 --> 10:21.192
'I can't swim in a three-piece suit.
So screw you, cynics! '

10:21.240 --> 10:23.276
Ah, now listen, before I forget,

10:23.320 --> 10:25.515
I thought you might like this.

10:25.560 --> 10:29.269
I did a few different versions of
Borneo Function that never got released.

10:29.320 --> 10:31.356
I thought you might
get a kick out of them.

10:31.400 --> 10:32.913
Oh, my God!

10:32.960 --> 10:37.556
'Wow! Super Hans is gonna shit
a brick when I show him this.

10:37.600 --> 10:40.478
'Finally, something to beat that car
battery he nicked off The Prodigy.'

10:41.960 --> 10:44.997
OK, well, great chatting to you, Sally.

10:45.040 --> 10:48.077
- Hi, honey, I'm home.
- And good luck with Midnight's Children.

10:48.120 --> 10:50.395
Remember no-one's ever
actually finished it. Bye.

10:50.440 --> 10:54.672
'Great call. Friendly but flirty,
didn't overstep the mark.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.995
'I could show Sophie the transcript.

'Maybe I should start
taping my phone calls.

10:59.520 --> 11:00.873
'No, Mark, that's how they got Nixon! '

11:00.920 --> 11:02.114
What's that?

11:02.160 --> 11:04.151
Just a jumper Russell got for me.

11:04.200 --> 11:07.237
He bought you a jumper?!
What else has he bought you?

11:07.280 --> 11:10.477
Nothing! Jesus! A squash racket.

11:10.520 --> 11:14.798
Jeremy, what's going on? Squash rackets
are not a normal form of remuneration.

11:14.840 --> 11:18.355
He doesn't have anyone to play with, and
two people can't share one bloody racket.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.152
Case closed, Columbo.

11:21.840 --> 11:26.834
So, listen, I've organised a trip to the
safari park on Saturday with Sally and Foz.

11:26.880 --> 11:29.792
The safari park with that dickhead Foz?!
Have you gone mental?

11:29.840 --> 11:32.035
It's an ironical day out.

11:32.080 --> 11:36.551
Oh, I get it. You're just another
dirty dog like everyone else.

11:36.600 --> 11:42.630
I am not a dirty dog, but I do
need you to come as my... sheath.

11:42.680 --> 11:43.749
Your sheath?

11:43.800 --> 11:46.951
As long as you're there, it's just
four people having an apparently nice time

11:47.000 --> 11:48.399
at an outdated venue.

11:48.440 --> 11:51.716
Fucking hell! What's going on?

11:51.760 --> 11:53.637
Are you trying to get your end away
while Sophie's not here?

11:53.680 --> 11:56.240
Sophie has not called me once yet,

11:56.280 --> 11:58.396
so there is actually a perfectly valid excuse

11:58.440 --> 12:00.749
for what I'm almost certainly not
going to try to do, OK?

12:00.800 --> 12:02.552
OK, if Sally was sitting here now

12:02.600 --> 12:04.636
and she said, "Mark, let's do it,"
what would you say?

12:04.680 --> 12:08.275
If she promised she wasn't a Glenn Close
type and happened to have

12:08.320 --> 12:10.151
- a recent clean Aids certificate?
- Yes.

12:10.200 --> 12:15.115
That's a hypothetical question.
I don't answer hypothetical questions.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.913
You're disgusting!

12:17.960 --> 12:22.875
But I like it! It's like going to
a strip joint with the Pope!

12:24.400 --> 12:26.197
A fucking safari park?!

12:26.240 --> 12:28.390
It's cool. It's retro.

12:28.440 --> 12:29.759
Exactly.

12:29.800 --> 12:32.360
(Mark) 'What exactly is my plan here?

12:32.400 --> 12:36.598
'Lured them all to the safari park
like a Bond villain, but what's the aim?

12:36.640 --> 12:41.350
'Torture myself with contact with
an unattainable woman, or what? '

12:41.400 --> 12:44.119
Yeah, I wasn't sure if I was gonna
make it cos of my job,

12:44.160 --> 12:46.435
but my boss was actually really cool about it.

12:46.480 --> 12:48.232
That's because it's not a real job.

12:48.280 --> 12:52.068
Oh, yeah? What about this?
Is that real enough for you?

12:52.120 --> 12:54.315
Don't flaunt your wad, Jeremy,
it's not becoming.

12:54.360 --> 12:58.558
<i>Well, you're becoming a pain
in the arse. How do you like that?</i>

12:58.600 --> 12:59.828
You wanker, Corrigan!

12:59.880 --> 13:01.359
Hey!

13:01.400 --> 13:02.719
See how much money you earned this week.

13:02.760 --> 13:03.988
Give it back!

13:04.040 --> 13:05.951
Not a lot in here, Mark,
apart from a couple of moths.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.958
- Give that back!
- Oops! Butter fingers!

13:09.000 --> 13:14.154
Jeremy, for God's sake! Foz, stop the car,
stop the car, Foz, he's thrown my wallet out!

13:14.200 --> 13:16.350
Oh, my God, he never!

13:16.400 --> 13:18.118
- Stop the car, Foz, it's Mark's wallet!
- All right!

13:18.160 --> 13:19.957
So, are you gonna go and get it?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.195
No, we need to call the warder.

13:22.240 --> 13:23.719
Don't be a dick! Go and get it.

13:23.760 --> 13:26.911
Wh-Wh-What if the lions eat me?

13:26.960 --> 13:29.428
The lions aren't gonna eat you, Mark.
Just nip and get it.

13:29.480 --> 13:31.277
- You should go and get it.
- I'm not gonna get it.

13:31.320 --> 13:32.992
Why should I have to bloody get it?

13:33.040 --> 13:37.909
Now, come on Mark, just get it. Get it, get it...

13:37.960 --> 13:40.190
(Both) Get it, get it, get it, get it.

13:40.240 --> 13:44.631
Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!

13:44.680 --> 13:46.432
Fucking hell!

13:46.480 --> 13:50.792
(Jez) 'Wow! I'm getting big laughs
off humiliating my best mate.

13:50.840 --> 13:53.479
'How can something so wrong
feel so right? '

13:53.520 --> 13:55.670
(Mark) 'Shit, this isn't good.

13:55.720 --> 13:58.712
'There are lions.
There are lions everywhere!

13:58.760 --> 14:02.070
'Where are they?
Is there one behind that tree?

14:02.120 --> 14:04.680
'Jeremy's literally thrown me
to the bloody lions!

14:04.720 --> 14:08.508
'What's next, crucifixion? Is he gonna
have me actually nailed on to a cross? '

14:08.560 --> 14:09.993
(Foz) Whey!

14:10.040 --> 14:11.837
Oh, you bloody bastards! Stop!

14:12.720 --> 14:16.030
Let me in, you bloody bastards!

14:16.080 --> 14:18.640
(Sally) It's not funny, Foz.
For fuck's sake, stop!

14:18.680 --> 14:22.673
All right, all right, all right.
Here he comes... Whey!

14:22.720 --> 14:25.996
'Christ! What do you do
to avoid lion attack?

14:26.040 --> 14:28.110
'Soil yourself?

14:28.160 --> 14:29.798
'Or is that grizzly bears?

14:29.840 --> 14:32.957
'Hate to shit myself for no reason,
and get eaten.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.197
'The final humiliation.'

14:36.120 --> 14:41.513
'Still nothing from Sophie.
Probably busy boning Jeff in Frankfurt.

14:41.560 --> 14:44.028
'Highly unlikely, but possible.

14:44.080 --> 14:47.197
'I should at least try to feel jealous
and betrayed, then I'll feel

14:47.240 --> 14:49.913
'less of a shit about pursuing Sally.'

14:49.960 --> 14:51.359
Oh, hi, Jez. Nancy.

14:51.400 --> 14:54.949
You're here. I thought you'd be
down at the Orgazoid's.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.993
Actually Russell had to go off to Norway this
morning, so I'm just here. Is that all right, Dad?

14:59.040 --> 15:00.758
Well, yeah.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.199
Are you all right?

15:02.240 --> 15:03.878
Yes, I'm fine.

15:03.920 --> 15:07.037
'What's bothering him?
He's thinking about something.

15:07.080 --> 15:09.514
'He never normally thinks about things.'

15:09.560 --> 15:11.312
So will you ask him now?

15:11.360 --> 15:14.511
Is it OK if Nancy uses
the computer to redo her CV?

15:14.560 --> 15:17.677
- My computer?
- Your computer, the computer, whatever.

15:17.720 --> 15:19.517
PHONE RINGS

15:19.560 --> 15:20.959
'Sally! '

15:21.000 --> 15:22.877
Sure. Hello.

15:22.920 --> 15:26.708
- "Hi, Mark, how are you doing?"
- Oh, good. Good, thanks.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.830
"I'm so sorry about yesterday."

15:28.880 --> 15:32.270
Oh, don't worry, that's fine.
It was funny... probably...

15:32.320 --> 15:35.551
if it hadn't been happening to me,
it might have been funny.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.989
"It was great seeing you.
It'd be great to meet up again."

15:38.040 --> 15:40.793
Oh, right. Well, I'd love to.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.479
"How about tomorrow? I could
drop round to your flat about three?"

15:43.520 --> 15:47.149
Yeah, the flat. That sounds lovely.

15:47.200 --> 15:48.838
'I can't invite her round here.

15:48.880 --> 15:51.314
'Anyone could be here. Sophie will find out.

15:51.360 --> 15:54.397
'Nothing's gonna happen, but nothing
must remain a total secret.'

15:54.440 --> 15:56.556
"So, what's your address?"

15:56.600 --> 15:58.830
Er, m-my address...
Hold on, let me just check.

15:58.880 --> 16:00.108
"You need to check your address?"

16:00.160 --> 16:03.118
Well, I do like to be totally accurate.

16:03.160 --> 16:06.277
Jez, what's Orgazoid's...
Russell's address?

16:06.320 --> 16:07.799
- Why?
- Just give it to me.

16:07.840 --> 16:11.116
- No, why?
- Because I'm a dirty dog, all right.

16:11.160 --> 16:12.639
31 Bishop's Avenue.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.592
Hey, 31, Bishop's Avenue.

16:15.640 --> 16:16.993
"Ooh, posh!

16:17.040 --> 16:18.758
"So, see you tomorrow."

16:18.800 --> 16:21.234
Yep, see you there... here, then.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.191
"Bye."

16:23.240 --> 16:26.869
So, Jez, do you think
it would be all right if I...

16:26.920 --> 16:30.117
sort of borrowed Russell's house?

16:30.160 --> 16:33.277
No. I don't particularly want to go
to that place right now, if I'm honest.

16:33.320 --> 16:36.039
Well, that's OK. If you prefer, you can
just give me the keys and I'II...

16:36.080 --> 16:37.957
No, you need me to do the alarms.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.710
There's like six different alarms, but I'm just
feeling a bit weird about the whole situation.

16:42.760 --> 16:43.988
Yeah? Why?

16:44.040 --> 16:46.634
Well, as it turns out...

16:47.800 --> 16:53.955
<i>...there were... there are certain additional
duties which I was expected to perform.</i>

16:54.000 --> 16:55.956
Duties? What duties?

16:56.000 --> 16:58.673
Well, you know, I'm his handyman.

16:58.720 --> 16:59.869
Yes?

17:00.920 --> 17:05.117
It's just he did expect me to...

17:05.160 --> 17:07.674
give him a... hand.

17:09.800 --> 17:11.118
You gave him a hand?

17:12.280 --> 17:13.679
I helped him out.

17:13.720 --> 17:17.269
You helped him out by...
giving him a hand?

17:20.880 --> 17:24.509
Wow! Just to clarify, you do mean...

17:24.560 --> 17:26.073
Yes.

17:26.119 --> 17:27.951
Shit!

17:28.000 --> 17:29.797
'I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.'

17:29.840 --> 17:33.355
And now I don't know what to do,
cos on the one hand...

17:33.400 --> 17:37.951
On the one hand, it's a really
good job, but on the other,

17:38.000 --> 17:41.788
I don't really want to go back to that place
or have anything to do with him.

17:41.840 --> 17:45.116
God, that's a really tough decision.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.116
'Stay! Stay so I can use the house.'

17:47.160 --> 17:49.993
I got Super Hans to fill in
yesterday. Said I was sick.

17:50.040 --> 17:54.272
There's loads needs doing before he comes
back, but I just feel a bit dirty, you know.

17:54.320 --> 17:56.436
Mmm, yeah, I know what you mean.

17:56.480 --> 18:00.439
I feel the same sometimes
when I come back from JLB

18:00.480 --> 18:02.391
and I've had to do loads of spreadsheets.

18:02.440 --> 18:05.000
I don't think it is the same, Mark.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.554
I feel like my soul is being
chipped away bit by bit.

18:07.600 --> 18:10.273
Welcome to the world of work, Jeremy.

18:10.320 --> 18:13.471
You know, you don't have to be
crazy to work here, but it helps.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.954
And you don't have to be a smackhead
to wank off old geezers,

18:16.000 --> 18:17.194
but that probably helps too.

18:17.240 --> 18:19.629
DOOR BUZZER

18:20.840 --> 18:23.229
Why didn't you tell me
about the wanking-off bit?

18:23.280 --> 18:24.599
Sorry, I didn't think.

18:24.640 --> 18:26.312
Well, you should have
bloody thought. Jesus!

18:26.360 --> 18:28.237
Did you do it?

18:28.280 --> 18:32.319
'Course I did. How do you think
I got these trainers?

18:32.360 --> 18:34.510
What's going on?
Who's wanking who off?

18:34.560 --> 18:37.074
Jeremy's been wanking off
this bloke for cash.

18:37.120 --> 18:39.475
No, I haven't. It's not...

18:39.520 --> 18:41.112
Jeremy, that is so you.

18:41.160 --> 18:43.355
I always knew you'd end up
doing something like that.

18:43.400 --> 18:45.391
What do you mean, that is so me?

18:45.440 --> 18:47.317
That is not so me.

18:50.280 --> 18:54.512
'So I have to jerk him off,
but at least I get a lift home.

18:54.560 --> 18:59.839
'Never mind. Only a few hand shandies
between me and a home studio.'

18:59.880 --> 19:02.440
I had a chance to think in Norway.

19:02.480 --> 19:03.708
About us.

19:03.760 --> 19:05.671
Us? Yeah?

19:05.720 --> 19:07.597
I've never had to pay for it before

19:07.640 --> 19:10.438
and I don't think
I wanna pay for it with you.

19:10.480 --> 19:12.311
Oh, right.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.318
So, can I stop doing it?

19:15.360 --> 19:20.992
Well, I want you to keep doing it, but I want
you to do it because you want to do it.

19:21.920 --> 19:25.356
It's just, I don't really want to do it.

19:25.400 --> 19:28.437
Could I start wearing a mitten?
Or maybe chuck a flannel over it?

19:28.480 --> 19:32.155
It's just really difficult for me,
because I really like you.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.668
I just don't think we should
see each other for a while.

19:34.720 --> 19:36.836
I'm going away
to get my head together.

19:36.880 --> 19:40.350
No, but the thing is,
I really like you too

19:40.400 --> 19:44.313
and I've been hiding my true feelings,
even from myself,

19:44.360 --> 19:47.113
but now they're all coming out...
What a lot of feelings!

19:47.160 --> 19:48.593
I'm sorry, Jez.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.312
'Home studio slipping away! '

19:50.360 --> 19:52.794
No, really, I mean it. I like you.

19:52.840 --> 19:55.070
Fuck that, I love you
and I want to have sex with you.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.314
No, Jeremy!

19:56.360 --> 19:59.318
Let me have a go on the old gear stick.
I'll take it up to fourth.

19:59.360 --> 20:01.999
This is not what I want.
Fuck off, Jez!

20:04.920 --> 20:09.277
'So, as it stands, I'm failing
to find work as a prostitute.

20:09.320 --> 20:11.959
'That doesn't feel good.
Still, got his house keys.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.595
'lf I keep working for him,
he'll have to keep paying me.'

20:16.880 --> 20:19.440
So this is your flat?

20:19.480 --> 20:22.790
This is it. I call it a flat,
because I'm quite modest,

20:22.840 --> 20:25.195
but, as you can see,
it's actually quite a massive house.

20:25.240 --> 20:29.631
'Shit. Am I seriously hoping
to have sex with Sally Slater?

20:29.680 --> 20:31.716
'This is all very wrong.'

20:31.760 --> 20:34.832
I always knew you'd do well for yourself,
but this is amazing.

20:34.880 --> 20:39.510
'Relax. You don't go to adulterers' prison
for drinking tea and playing Connect Four.'

20:39.560 --> 20:42.438
And Jeremy? Is he like your butler?

20:42.480 --> 20:44.869
There's not much else he can do
in the real world.

20:44.920 --> 20:48.071
I've been very lucky
and I like to spread that around.

20:48.120 --> 20:50.634
'Glad I sprayed my nuts
with aftershave, though.

20:50.680 --> 20:53.956
'You never know how things might
turn out. I'm no Nostradamus.'

20:54.000 --> 20:55.831
I never knew you were into stuff like this.

20:55.880 --> 21:00.351
Oh, I just... really appreciate
the male form.

21:00.400 --> 21:03.836
Right. I mean, I think
it's kind of beautiful, I suppose.

21:03.880 --> 21:07.634
Yeah, there is something beautiful
about the male member.

21:07.680 --> 21:11.036
It's good to have a look at it,
now and again.

21:11.080 --> 21:14.311
A reminder of what can happen,
if you're not careful.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.998
'What am I saying?

21:16.040 --> 21:19.316
'At least he's going.
Don't need a witness to this fiasco.'

21:19.360 --> 21:22.796
Here, Sally, I got you a present.

21:22.840 --> 21:26.879
Hitchhiker's Guide. It's the same copy
we read from at Sutton Hoo.

21:26.920 --> 21:32.472
I got it signed by Douglas Adams
when he came to the big WH Smith's.

21:32.520 --> 21:34.556
Oh, this is lovely. Thank you.

21:34.600 --> 21:37.637
It's so... romantic.

21:37.680 --> 21:40.114
It's the perfect way to start our affair.

21:40.160 --> 21:41.832
Our affair?

21:41.880 --> 21:45.873
OK, that sounds good. What sort of
affair were you thinking of?

21:45.920 --> 21:48.480
The Dreyfus Affair
or more like the Watergate Affair?

21:48.520 --> 21:51.080
Cos I can tell you right now
I'm not burgling any Democrats.

21:51.120 --> 21:52.792
Relax.

21:52.840 --> 21:55.149
We both want it to happen.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.509
'Oh, my God, she's gonna kiss me.

21:57.560 --> 22:00.154
'I'm such a bastard.
I'm meant to be getting married.

22:00.200 --> 22:03.158
'I'm out of my depth. I thought she was
a frightened little suburban mouse,

22:03.200 --> 22:05.111
'but, no, she's my nightmare -

22:05.160 --> 22:09.278
'a liberated, sexually adventurous,
urban woman.'

22:09.320 --> 22:12.551
Er, Sally, look, I'm really not sure I...

22:12.600 --> 22:15.910
'What am I doing? This isn't me,
I can't have an affair.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.838
'I'm not French. I'm the least
French person on the planet.

22:18.880 --> 22:21.758
'My favourite cheeses
are Cheddar and Red Leicester.'

22:21.800 --> 22:28.194
Look, I'm sorry, Sally,
I just don't know if I can do this.

22:28.240 --> 22:29.992
I mean, you've got your...

22:30.040 --> 22:33.510
miserable relationship and the truth is,
I've got one of my own.

22:33.560 --> 22:38.156
I just feel that, you know,
if it ain't broke, don't fix it,

22:38.200 --> 22:42.796
and even if it is broke, just ignore it
and maybe it'll be sort of OK,

22:42.840 --> 22:45.593
like the environment.

22:45.640 --> 22:47.358
CAR DOOR SLAMS SHUT

22:47.400 --> 22:49.277
Who's that?
'Is Russell back?

22:49.320 --> 22:51.117
'Oh, no! '

22:51.160 --> 22:52.275
Foz!

22:52.320 --> 22:54.515
Shit. He's fucking followed me again.

22:54.560 --> 22:57.120
He's obsessed with the idea
that I'm screwing around on him.

22:57.160 --> 23:00.311
Well, I mean, I suppose
you are sort of trying to...

23:00.360 --> 23:02.191
Look, the door's locked and...

23:02.240 --> 23:04.071
- (Jez) Foz?
- (Foz) Where's Sally?

23:04.120 --> 23:05.235
'Great. Thanks, Jeremy(!)'

23:05.280 --> 23:06.508
(Foz) Sally!

23:06.560 --> 23:08.676
Shit! Hide!

23:08.720 --> 23:11.109
I'll just say I'm working here, cleaning.

23:11.160 --> 23:13.674
I can't hide. I'm not a good hider.

23:13.720 --> 23:17.872
'What the hell am I doing? I'm doing
a Jeremy. This is a wake-up call.'

23:17.920 --> 23:19.319
- Sally!
- 'I've definitely hit a new low.'

23:19.360 --> 23:21.191
Foz? What are you doing here?

23:21.240 --> 23:24.312
What the fuck are you doing here?
Are you screwing Wankerthon's mate?

23:24.360 --> 23:27.591
Of course I'm bloody not,
I'm cleaning, you arsehole.

23:27.640 --> 23:31.758
This is Mark's flat
and Jeremy's his servant.

23:31.800 --> 23:33.791
Well, not servant really. More of a...

23:33.840 --> 23:35.558
PHONE RINGS

23:35.600 --> 23:37.795
<i>'Shit! Now she calls.'</i>

23:37.840 --> 23:39.159
What's that?

23:39.200 --> 23:43.113
That's just the normal ringing noise.
That's normal.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.149
Yeah?

23:44.200 --> 23:48.557
'Oh, must hide more.
Can't hide more.'

23:48.600 --> 23:52.878
Corrigan.
Are you spying on my wife?

23:54.760 --> 23:56.398
Are you wanking over her?

23:56.440 --> 23:57.919
Er...

24:01.000 --> 24:02.513
Yes.

24:02.560 --> 24:04.278
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

24:04.320 --> 24:07.153
I'm spying on her and...

24:09.040 --> 24:10.951
<i>...wanking over her.</i>

24:11.000 --> 24:13.560
You really are a filthy little perv,
aren't you?

24:13.600 --> 24:15.909
Uh-huh, I suppose so.

24:17.480 --> 24:19.755
Come on, we're going.

24:19.800 --> 24:23.190
'Wow, he didn't hit me.
Bit disappointing.

24:23.240 --> 24:24.798
'I thought I deserved to be hit.'

24:24.840 --> 24:29.277
Cheer up, Mark. Least now
you've got a funny story to tell people.

24:29.320 --> 24:34.758
Yes, I guess this is a pretty funny story.

24:34.800 --> 24:39.510
'One that I'll never ever tell anyone
because of my deep and burning shame.'

24:47.280 --> 24:53.037
<i>Paranoia, paranoia,
everybody's coming to get me</i>

24:53.080 --> 24:55.640
<i>Just say you never met me</i>

24:55.680 --> 24:58.990
<i>I'm running underground
with the moles</i>

24:59.040 --> 25:00.632
<i>Digging holes.</i>
