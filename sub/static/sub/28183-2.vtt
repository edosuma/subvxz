00:17.412 --> 00:18.620
Good morning, Ms. Krissman.

00:18.621 --> 00:20.710
Good morning.

00:20.711 --> 00:22.830
Good morning.

00:26.331 --> 00:28.210
Fifth floor.

00:30.211 --> 00:32.040
Ah, gracias.

00:37.001 --> 00:38.170
Ms. Krissman.

00:38.171 --> 00:39.750
Deputy Phillips.

00:39.751 --> 00:41.870
- How's Evelyn?
- She had a rough night.

00:41.871 --> 00:43.710
I'm so sorry to hear that.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.120
You won't say anything?

00:45.121 --> 00:47.040
Now, what kind of person
would I be if I did that?

00:52.671 --> 00:54.710
Good morning.

00:54.711 --> 00:57.290
- It was your anniversary?
- Yeah, our fifth.

00:57.291 --> 01:00.460
Cynthia surprised me with
this trip to Yellowstone.

01:00.461 --> 01:02.250
She loved the outdoors.

01:02.251 --> 01:04.209
And what happened, Mr. Covington?

01:04.211 --> 01:06.910
You know, we were just up
on a trail, hiking.

01:06.911 --> 01:08.666
- It was steep.
- She fell?

01:08.667 --> 01:09.932
She slipped.

01:09.933 --> 01:12.250
Now, Robin, I know that
there are people out there

01:12.251 --> 01:13.710
who believe that I had something to do

01:13.711 --> 01:14.750
with Cynthia's death.

01:14.751 --> 01:17.310
I mean, I understand.
We live in a cynical time.

01:17.311 --> 01:20.001
But what kind of a person would
think something like that?

01:21.671 --> 01:23.000
Really?

01:23.001 --> 01:24.620
- He pushed her.
- Definitely pushed her.

01:24.621 --> 01:25.960
He seems sad, though.

01:25.961 --> 01:27.210
Men get sad when they don't have a wife.

01:27.211 --> 01:28.580
If you actually murdered someone,

01:28.581 --> 01:30.870
why would you ever go on TV
to talk about it?

01:30.871 --> 01:32.331
Well, I do like Robin Roberts.

01:33.671 --> 01:34.960
Who is this guy, anyway?

01:34.961 --> 01:36.790
Arthur Covington,
one of the most successful

01:36.791 --> 01:38.410
criminal defense attorneys in Manhattan.

01:38.411 --> 01:40.410
At some point in your career,
you will lose to him.

01:40.411 --> 01:41.501
Everyone does.

01:41.502 --> 01:42.790
Except for me.

01:42.791 --> 01:44.580
- I heard his wife died?
- She slipped off a cliff.

01:44.581 --> 01:46.370
Oh, I didn't realize he killed her.

01:46.371 --> 01:47.331
Okay.

01:47.332 --> 01:50.670
New cases. Seth. Chavez.

01:50.671 --> 01:52.080
Ng.

01:52.081 --> 01:53.670
Leonard, I need you on Mendelson.

01:53.671 --> 01:55.290
My post office assault is going to trial.

01:55.291 --> 01:56.636
In fact, I'm late.

01:56.637 --> 01:58.250
I can do it.

01:58.251 --> 01:59.461
- Oliver.
- I got it.

02:03.961 --> 02:05.370
You like Robin Roberts, right?

02:05.371 --> 02:06.961
This is not a good morning.

02:15.501 --> 02:17.790
_

02:17.791 --> 02:18.800
_

02:18.801 --> 02:20.801
_

02:20.828 --> 02:22.828
_

02:22.858 --> 02:24.858
_

02:44.081 --> 02:46.330
I'm assuming from
your presence here today

02:46.331 --> 02:48.080
the parties have been
unable to reach a deal?

02:48.081 --> 02:49.580
Your Honor, the government
has made a reasonable offer

02:49.581 --> 02:51.580
to defense counsel.
We're prepared to go to trial.

02:51.581 --> 02:52.870
When can you be ready?

02:52.871 --> 02:54.691
We're ready right now, Your Honor.
We can start today.

02:54.692 --> 02:56.540
I have a witness here, Merced Garcia,

02:56.541 --> 02:58.120
who was in the post office that afternoon

02:58.121 --> 02:59.460
and who is prepared to testify

02:59.461 --> 03:01.170
that Mr. Boyd committed
the assault as alleged.

03:01.171 --> 03:03.080
Your Honor, can we have a minute?

03:12.621 --> 03:13.961
Triceratops?

03:15.581 --> 03:17.290
Stegosaurus?

03:17.291 --> 03:18.960
Never really knew the difference between

03:18.961 --> 03:21.330
a Triceratops and a Stegosaurus.

03:21.331 --> 03:23.540
Triceratops has horns.

03:23.541 --> 03:27.460
Well, I am not smarter than
a fifth grader, apparently.

03:27.461 --> 03:28.831
And you're not even a fifth grader.

03:30.411 --> 03:31.461
You here with Dad?

03:35.461 --> 03:37.710
Velociraptor!

03:43.001 --> 03:44.670
We're going to work this out, Your Honor.

03:44.671 --> 03:46.750
You're telling me I can take
this trial off calendar?

03:46.751 --> 03:48.710
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Well, that's it.

03:48.711 --> 03:50.710
Thank you both.

03:50.711 --> 03:52.410
Mr. Garcia?

03:52.411 --> 03:53.790
I'm sorry, we're not gonna
need you after all.

03:53.791 --> 03:55.500
- Uh, no?
- No.

03:55.501 --> 03:56.540
Thank you for coming in, though.

03:56.541 --> 03:57.580
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

03:57.581 --> 03:58.541
It's okay. Thank you.

03:58.542 --> 04:00.460
- I-I can go?
- You can go.

04:00.461 --> 04:01.711
Kim!

04:03.171 --> 04:04.234
Merced Garcia?

04:11.251 --> 04:12.370
Mr. Garcia,

04:12.371 --> 04:14.040
we're with Immigration
and Customs Enforcement.

04:14.041 --> 04:15.910
Do you have any identification on you?

04:15.911 --> 04:17.500
Identification.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.079
Are you a citizen of
the United States of America?

04:19.081 --> 04:20.370
I'm here for the trial.

04:20.370 --> 04:22.501
Do you have any permission
to be in the United States?

04:25.671 --> 04:27.170
He asked me to be here.

04:27.171 --> 04:29.710
You can go talk to Mr. Knox. Uh, please.

04:29.711 --> 04:31.330
Did you come here alone today?

04:39.621 --> 04:41.710
Uh, Mr. Knox, please.

04:41.711 --> 04:43.290
- We need to go.
- Sir, I...

05:22.041 --> 05:24.250
Do you know where my daddy is?

05:25.951 --> 05:34.345
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

05:35.528 --> 05:37.839
Okay, young man. We're
gonna get to the bottom of this.

05:37.864 --> 05:40.620
It's a big courthouse, and
sometimes people get lost.

05:40.621 --> 05:43.290
I get lost, and I've worked here
a long time.

05:43.291 --> 05:44.911
Do you know how long I've worked here?

05:45.831 --> 05:47.410
Since those guys were around.

05:48.461 --> 05:49.870
What is your dad's name?

05:49.871 --> 05:52.370
- Merced.
- And what is your last name, sir?

05:52.371 --> 05:53.371
Garcia.

05:53.372 --> 05:55.040
Okay, Mr. Garcia.

05:55.041 --> 05:57.080
- Does your dad have a phone?
- Yes.

05:57.081 --> 05:58.671
Can you write the number down for me?

06:07.211 --> 06:09.040
Soy Merced Garcia. Por favor...

06:09.041 --> 06:10.211
How about your mom?

06:13.711 --> 06:16.580
Do you have other family members here?

06:16.581 --> 06:18.460
Mm, no.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.197
Just Daddy.

06:20.871 --> 06:25.370
Okay, well, your dad
was in Courtroom 501.

06:25.371 --> 06:28.080
We're gonna take a walk
and see what we can find.

06:28.081 --> 06:30.211
Daphne! Are you at the desk?

06:32.871 --> 06:34.910
- You're not Daphne.
- Ron Marin.

06:34.911 --> 06:36.790
Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

06:36.791 --> 06:38.330
How can I help you, Agent Marin?

06:38.331 --> 06:39.621
We're looking for a boy.

06:41.411 --> 06:43.370
- A boy?
- Approximately seven years old.

06:43.371 --> 06:44.710
Last name Garcia.

06:44.711 --> 06:46.410
We picked up his father, Merced,
on the fifth floor.

06:46.411 --> 06:48.040
Illegal entry.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.960
Marshals tell us he came in
the building with a boy.

06:49.961 --> 06:51.500
No reason not to believe the marshals.

06:51.501 --> 06:52.621
Have you seen him?

06:54.501 --> 06:55.790
No, I have not.

07:02.371 --> 07:04.501
Anything else I can help you
with, Agent Marin?

07:07.961 --> 07:09.750
Just contact us if you see him around.

07:17.621 --> 07:18.871
I need your help.

07:23.791 --> 07:25.210
- He's icing me out.
- Who?

07:25.211 --> 07:27.040
- Roger.
- Oh, yes.

07:27.041 --> 07:28.370
Maybe I'm just being paranoid.

07:28.371 --> 07:30.540
You're not. You're definitely not.

07:30.541 --> 07:32.250
- It's because of the Sarco case.
- Yes.

07:32.251 --> 07:33.910
What do I do?

07:33.911 --> 07:35.670
Well, when I was in your shoes,

07:35.671 --> 07:37.620
I'd always go by your office
and complain.

07:37.621 --> 07:39.910
- You could try that.
- I should go by my office?

07:39.911 --> 07:41.000
Sounds weird when you say it.

07:41.001 --> 07:42.290
I should just talk to Roger.

07:42.291 --> 07:44.290
And say what?

07:44.291 --> 07:45.580
"I'm so sad.

07:45.581 --> 07:47.290
I'm not getting any work.

07:47.291 --> 07:49.040
Please be nice to me...

07:49.041 --> 07:50.500
I've given that speech many times...

07:50.501 --> 07:52.960
I've just never been
in this position before.

07:52.961 --> 07:54.120
You know what you need to do?

07:54.121 --> 07:57.120
You need to go out
and kill your own food.

07:57.121 --> 07:58.830
- What?
- Eat your own food?

07:58.831 --> 08:00.080
I don't know... I've had lunch.

08:00.081 --> 08:02.580
Kill what you eat. Eat what you kill.

08:02.581 --> 08:03.870
Eat what you kill!

08:03.871 --> 08:05.620
The point is, you need
to make your own work.

08:05.621 --> 08:07.330
Don't go looking at Roger for handouts.

08:07.331 --> 08:10.410
Find your food and kill it!

08:10.411 --> 08:11.910
Is that what you did?

08:11.911 --> 08:13.621
No, I just went by your office.

08:36.001 --> 08:38.500
Ramon, this is Jay.

08:38.501 --> 08:40.250
Jay's gonna help us find your dad.

08:40.251 --> 08:41.789
Hi, Ramon. Nice to meet you.

08:41.791 --> 08:43.539
Oh, cool.

08:43.541 --> 08:44.620
A Troodon.

08:46.081 --> 08:47.830
Is this yours?

08:47.831 --> 08:49.870
A Troodon is the smartest dinosaur.

08:49.871 --> 08:51.000
Did you know that?

08:51.001 --> 08:51.961
Oh, you probably know that.

08:51.962 --> 08:54.000
It also has three-fingered hands

08:54.001 --> 08:56.460
- and binocular vision.
- Oh.

08:56.461 --> 08:58.210
She thought it was a Stegosaurus.

08:58.211 --> 09:00.330
Okay.

09:00.331 --> 09:03.290
Can you finish stamping those
files while I talk to Jay?

09:03.291 --> 09:06.961
And you can stamp really, really hard.

09:11.461 --> 09:12.750
Have they come back?

09:12.751 --> 09:15.210
No, but they'll figure out
he hasn't left the building.

09:15.211 --> 09:16.960
I don't know if he's undocumented,

09:16.961 --> 09:18.210
I don't know anything about his status.

09:18.211 --> 09:19.750
Maybe this is a mistake.

09:19.751 --> 09:21.000
Maybe he's been released.

09:21.001 --> 09:24.620
I just know that I'm not
handing over that little boy

09:24.621 --> 09:26.460
until I know where his dad is

09:26.461 --> 09:29.040
and we have some reassurance
about where he's going.

09:29.041 --> 09:30.671
He can't stay here, Tina.

09:32.041 --> 09:33.790
He's staying here.

09:33.791 --> 09:36.120
I'm staying here.

09:36.121 --> 09:37.910
Until I know where his dad is

09:37.911 --> 09:40.210
and what happens if they take him.

09:40.211 --> 09:42.580
Let me talk to the lawyer
who was handling the case.

09:42.581 --> 09:45.080
That might be the easiest way
to find out where Merced is.

09:45.081 --> 09:46.870
- Merced Garcia?
- Yes.

09:46.871 --> 09:47.960
That's not your case. Why...

09:47.961 --> 09:49.210
He was picked up by ICE.

09:49.211 --> 09:50.370
What are you talking about?

09:50.371 --> 09:51.910
- In the courthouse.
- In the courthouse?

09:51.911 --> 09:53.500
- After my hearing?
- Yes.

09:53.501 --> 09:54.580
- Who told you this?
- Tina.

09:54.581 --> 09:55.501
He was cooperating.

09:55.502 --> 09:57.000
He was a cooperating witness,

09:57.001 --> 09:58.410
and they picked him up in the courthouse?

09:58.411 --> 09:59.500
Yes.

09:59.501 --> 10:00.580
And not just that.

10:00.581 --> 10:01.960
He had a kid with him.

10:01.961 --> 10:03.830
- A kid?
- Yes, a boy.

10:03.831 --> 10:05.580
- Where is he now?
- He's still in the courthouse.

10:05.581 --> 10:07.080
- This is totally outrageous.
- Yes.

10:07.081 --> 10:08.500
He didn't want to testify.

10:08.501 --> 10:10.540
I had to beg him to come in,
and then they take him?

10:10.541 --> 10:11.710
In our courthouse?

10:11.711 --> 10:13.330
They are arresting parents

10:13.331 --> 10:15.370
dropping their children off at school.

10:15.371 --> 10:17.750
They are getting motels
to turn over guest lists

10:17.751 --> 10:19.620
and running Latino-sounding names.

10:19.621 --> 10:21.500
They are looking at records of people

10:21.501 --> 10:25.250
who report domestic violence
and arresting the victims.

10:25.251 --> 10:26.910
This is where we are now.

10:26.911 --> 10:28.000
This is what they do.

10:28.001 --> 10:30.371
Now, what are you going to do?

10:32.711 --> 10:34.001
There's nothing we can do.

10:35.541 --> 10:36.750
I will call over to ICE.

10:36.751 --> 10:38.410
I don't think it will help.

10:38.411 --> 10:41.830
Well, that's why I work on
the other side of the street...

10:41.831 --> 10:42.910
to help.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.402
I started looking into
this Covington murder.

10:54.403 --> 10:55.472
- Why?
- Kill what you eat.

10:55.473 --> 10:56.532
What?

10:56.533 --> 10:57.992
Anyway, it's odd.

10:57.993 --> 10:59.702
The forensics don't match his story.

10:59.703 --> 11:01.112
What floor is supplies on?

11:01.113 --> 11:02.362
Binders are on 18,

11:02.363 --> 11:04.742
file folders are
behind the copy room on 21,

11:04.743 --> 11:06.152
pens, pads, writing supplies on 19.

11:06.153 --> 11:07.202
- What are you looking for?
- Jason.

11:07.203 --> 11:09.072
I borrowed $5 from him for a sandwich.

11:09.073 --> 11:10.612
Where do you get a sandwich for $5?

11:10.613 --> 11:12.282
You know what... I'm just gonna go to 16.

11:12.283 --> 11:13.822
Jason's on 22.

11:14.993 --> 11:16.534
But he's not in today.

11:18.903 --> 11:21.112
It looks like she was shoved,

11:21.113 --> 11:23.112
then beaten on the head with a rock.

11:23.113 --> 11:25.282
There's a motive, too...
an insurance policy.

11:25.283 --> 11:27.572
- Just renewed and improved.
- Okay. Got it, yes.

11:27.573 --> 11:29.202
You guys already convinced me
he killed her, and if he did,

11:29.203 --> 11:30.203
they'll charge him in Wyoming.

11:30.204 --> 11:31.942
Now I have to get back to work here

11:31.943 --> 11:33.702
because I have work because
I didn't piss off Roger.

11:33.703 --> 11:34.772
Here's the thing, though...

11:34.773 --> 11:37.096
he won't be charged in Wyoming
because he can't be

11:37.097 --> 11:39.942
because Arthur Covington
committed the perfect murder.

11:42.783 --> 11:44.073
You...

11:46.533 --> 11:48.402
First the animals,
now the national parks.

11:48.403 --> 11:52.572
Bizarre and little-known
and explosive legal fact...

11:52.573 --> 11:54.702
even though all of Yellowstone

11:54.703 --> 11:56.822
is in the judicial district of Wyoming

11:56.823 --> 11:59.402
and most of it is
in the state of Wyoming,

11:59.403 --> 12:02.532
small parts of it
are in Idaho and Montana.

12:02.533 --> 12:04.032
Yeah, okay, that's actually
Idaho and that's Montana,

12:04.033 --> 12:05.282
but go ahead.

12:05.283 --> 12:07.942
Anyway, the sixth Amendment
to the Constitution says

12:07.943 --> 12:10.532
juries have to be drawn
from the state and district

12:10.533 --> 12:12.112
where a crime is committed, right?

12:12.113 --> 12:15.112
Well, in Covington's case,
that means a jury has to come

12:15.113 --> 12:17.072
from the Idaho section of Yellowstone

12:17.073 --> 12:20.442
because that is where
Covington's wife died.

12:20.443 --> 12:24.202
But that is impossible
because nobody lives

12:24.203 --> 12:26.862
in the Idaho section of
Yellowstone... nobody.

12:26.863 --> 12:29.362
Population... 0.

12:29.363 --> 12:31.612
- Did you make that?
- I thought it would be fun.

12:31.613 --> 12:33.862
This is the ultimate loophole.

12:33.863 --> 12:35.572
A small stretch of land

12:35.573 --> 12:38.822
where you can commit crime
with impunity... even murder.

12:38.823 --> 12:41.536
If you're smart and you want
to kill someone,

12:42.403 --> 12:44.153
this is the place to do it.

12:48.363 --> 12:52.822
That is the most insane thing
I've ever heard in my life.

12:52.823 --> 12:55.152
You're just making fun
of the midwest, right?

12:55.153 --> 12:57.902
Kate. I think you want to see this.

12:57.903 --> 12:59.782
We believe that Mr. Arthur Covington

12:59.783 --> 13:02.032
murdered his wife, Cynthia Covington,

13:02.033 --> 13:03.862
in the western area of the park

13:03.863 --> 13:05.782
right here in Idaho.

13:05.783 --> 13:08.072
We intended to file charges
against Mr. Covington.

13:08.073 --> 13:09.902
However, because of a disturbing

13:09.903 --> 13:11.572
jurisdictional deficiency,

13:11.573 --> 13:12.782
we are unable to do so...

13:12.783 --> 13:13.942
You're right.

13:13.943 --> 13:15.447
Yes, of course.

13:15.448 --> 13:17.782
But unfortunately, that means
you now need another case.

13:17.783 --> 13:19.032
No, it doesn't mean that.

13:19.033 --> 13:20.652
Arthur Covington lives
and works in New York,

13:20.653 --> 13:22.862
which means if he planned
the crime in New York,

13:22.863 --> 13:24.112
I can get him here.

13:25.403 --> 13:27.152
I am proud of you.

13:27.153 --> 13:29.492
All big predator out on the hunt,

13:29.493 --> 13:31.863
eating your food and killing it.

13:33.743 --> 13:36.202
Or the other way around.

13:36.203 --> 13:37.902
The name Merced Garcia isn't coming up

13:37.903 --> 13:39.782
in the ICE Detainee Locator System,

13:39.783 --> 13:41.652
but without an Alien Registration Number,

13:41.653 --> 13:43.152
it's very difficult to track him.

13:43.153 --> 13:44.442
And he may not even be processed yet.

13:44.443 --> 13:45.862
Or accurately.

13:45.863 --> 13:46.992
Look, I can try some contacts

13:46.993 --> 13:47.823
I have at the agency, but...

13:47.824 --> 13:49.112
What about Ramon?

13:49.113 --> 13:50.322
You said he was at the courthouse.

13:50.323 --> 13:52.532
I'm asking what if she turns
him over to ICE?

13:52.533 --> 13:56.322
If that happens, he goes into a
refugee resettlement facility.

13:56.323 --> 13:59.242
Now, that could be in New York
or Michigan or Florida.

13:59.243 --> 14:01.442
He could be moved around.
He probably would be.

14:01.443 --> 14:03.702
He'd be there for days or months.

14:03.703 --> 14:06.442
There are rules, but the rules
don't really apply anymore.

14:06.443 --> 14:08.072
He could be kept in a cage.

14:08.073 --> 14:09.992
He could be given psychotropic drugs.

14:09.993 --> 14:11.902
He could be forced to walk
around without shoes,

14:11.903 --> 14:13.492
to clean toilets with his bare hands,

14:13.493 --> 14:15.338
to sleep standing up.

14:15.823 --> 14:17.715
He could be sexually abused.

14:18.945 --> 14:20.655
You want to know what happens?

14:20.783 --> 14:22.442
This happens.

14:22.443 --> 14:24.112
If Merced gets deported,

14:24.113 --> 14:27.282
Ramon very well might stay
in the US, in foster care,

14:27.283 --> 14:30.992
not allowed to leave,
in a kind of legal purgatory...

14:30.993 --> 14:34.524
not a citizen, not free,
not able to go home.

14:34.903 --> 14:36.612
He just disappears.

14:43.153 --> 14:45.073
Mr. Garcia?

14:46.783 --> 14:48.203
Are you hungry?

14:51.403 --> 14:54.113
You seem like you'd be good
with puzzles, Mr. Garcia.

14:55.743 --> 14:57.367
Ramon?

15:16.863 --> 15:19.032
He told you to wait here.

15:19.033 --> 15:21.242
- He said don't move.
- Yes.

15:21.243 --> 15:24.153
Maybe he came back to find me
and I wasn't here.

15:25.943 --> 15:28.110
He always comes back.

15:28.111 --> 15:30.072
He wanted to come back
more than anything.

15:30.073 --> 15:33.202
I know he wanted to come back.

15:33.203 --> 15:35.073
He didn't leave you.

15:35.412 --> 15:37.202
Then where is he?

15:39.510 --> 15:43.219
I know how scary and confusing this is,

15:43.220 --> 15:45.430
but I can't lie to you... I won't.

15:47.090 --> 15:49.089
We don't know where he is.

15:49.090 --> 15:50.429
We're trying to find him,

15:50.430 --> 15:53.469
and I know that he wants to
see you and talk to you.

15:53.470 --> 15:56.549
I know how much he loves you
and misses you.

15:56.550 --> 15:58.839
He didn't want this to happen.

15:58.840 --> 16:01.087
I also know

16:01.088 --> 16:03.929
he's not going to be coming back
to this bench any time soon,

16:03.930 --> 16:05.299
and he'd want you to eat

16:05.300 --> 16:08.879
and play with this cool puzzle
that I have

16:08.880 --> 16:10.453
instead of...

16:11.050 --> 16:13.550
sitting in this boring hallway.

16:17.720 --> 16:19.550
Will you come back with me?

16:33.720 --> 16:35.179
No.

16:35.180 --> 16:37.259
- We need to take the boy.
- No.

16:37.260 --> 16:39.259
Ms. Krissman, you need to step aside.

16:39.260 --> 16:40.839
Otherwise, you will be arrested

16:40.840 --> 16:42.089
for interfering with law enforcement.

16:42.090 --> 16:43.839
I'm not stepping aside.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.469
I'm not gonna move.

16:45.470 --> 16:47.339
And I can assure you

16:47.340 --> 16:50.009
that arresting the irascible
and eccentric but beloved

16:50.010 --> 16:51.759
longtime Clerk of Court

16:51.760 --> 16:53.469
for the United States District Court

16:53.470 --> 16:56.049
for the Southern District of New York

16:56.050 --> 16:58.589
is not gonna wear well
on your service record.

16:58.590 --> 17:00.300
I can assure you of that.

17:01.510 --> 17:04.469
Now, there's another way
we can handle this.

17:04.470 --> 17:07.089
I can call the Chief Judge,
the child's attorney.

17:07.089 --> 17:10.089
This can be resolved civilly and legally,

17:10.089 --> 17:11.969
as if we were in a courthouse.

17:11.970 --> 17:15.469
Or you can do this barbarically.

17:15.470 --> 17:16.679
You have a job to do.

17:16.680 --> 17:17.878
I understand that.

17:17.880 --> 17:18.949
We all do.

17:18.950 --> 17:22.299
But this is not your job.

17:32.300 --> 17:34.245
I'm sorry, Ms. Krissman.

17:34.930 --> 17:37.680
Ms. Krissman, is there a problem?

17:38.875 --> 17:40.009
What's going on?

17:40.010 --> 17:41.969
Deputy, I'm Agent Marin with ICE.

17:41.970 --> 17:43.179
We need to take the child,

17:43.180 --> 17:45.139
and Ms. Krissman is interfering.

17:45.140 --> 17:47.259
I'll need to make an arrest
if she doesn't step aside.

17:47.260 --> 17:48.429
I'm not stepping aside.

17:48.430 --> 17:50.339
Then I'm placing you under arrest.

17:50.340 --> 17:52.179
Deputy, if you could help.

17:59.680 --> 18:02.679
Now, what kind of person
would I be if I did that?

18:26.323 --> 18:28.282
Roger, Knox, let's go.

18:28.283 --> 18:29.952
Now.

18:41.953 --> 18:43.822
Judge?

18:53.413 --> 18:56.742
Well... this is a first.

18:56.743 --> 18:59.622
Let's have everyone
take a step back, okay?

19:01.013 --> 19:05.053
Ramon, son, I'd like you
to sit right over there.

19:09.973 --> 19:12.592
- Agent, uh...?
- Marin.

19:12.593 --> 19:14.802
Agent Marin.

19:14.803 --> 19:16.802
You need to move back. Now.

19:16.803 --> 19:19.262
Your Honor, respectfully,
we're not in your courtroom.

19:19.263 --> 19:21.092
You have no authority to direct me

19:21.093 --> 19:23.592
or my fellow agents to do anything.

19:23.593 --> 19:25.222
We're attempting to make a lawful arrest.

19:25.223 --> 19:27.722
You are in my courthouse.

19:27.723 --> 19:29.262
I'm responsible for the supervision

19:29.263 --> 19:31.222
of the United States District Court

19:31.223 --> 19:33.012
for the Southern District of New York.

19:33.013 --> 19:35.052
That's where we are.
That's why I am here.

19:35.053 --> 19:37.262
I am not a potted plant.

19:37.263 --> 19:38.922
And you're not going to make
an arrest right now...

19:38.923 --> 19:40.632
lawful or otherwise...

19:40.633 --> 19:42.842
because there are three men
standing right here

19:42.843 --> 19:45.182
with guns and badges who
aren't going to allow you

19:45.183 --> 19:46.592
to make an arrest.

19:46.593 --> 19:48.302
And I'm not gonna tell them to stand down

19:48.303 --> 19:50.802
until the adults here have an opportunity

19:50.803 --> 19:52.472
to talk this through.

19:52.473 --> 19:54.473
Step back.

19:59.473 --> 20:02.592
You don't have any authority
to direct the marshals, either.

20:02.593 --> 20:04.632
Marshals are under the
Department of Justice,

20:04.633 --> 20:06.022
not the judiciary.

20:07.683 --> 20:09.422
The United States Attorney
makes this call.

20:09.423 --> 20:10.512
Not you.

20:17.683 --> 20:20.472
Your Honor, can we take a second?

20:28.683 --> 20:29.972
Judge.

20:29.973 --> 20:31.722
I'm with you on this. I am.

20:31.723 --> 20:34.092
But we've got a serious
situation here, okay?

20:34.093 --> 20:36.802
We are in the Twilight Zone now.

20:36.803 --> 20:40.052
I can... hold these guys off
with the marshals for so long.

20:40.053 --> 20:41.552
I can get them to leave.

20:41.553 --> 20:43.182
But when this goes into Washington...

20:43.183 --> 20:44.842
and it will, soon...

20:44.843 --> 20:46.472
to the Attorney General

20:46.473 --> 20:49.440
and the Secretary of Homeland Security,

20:50.423 --> 20:53.382
we know how that is going to end.

20:59.683 --> 21:01.972
- Where's the boy's father?
- He was taken into custody.

21:01.973 --> 21:04.092
We don't know his current whereabouts.

21:04.093 --> 21:06.012
- You guys don't know, either?
- No.

21:06.013 --> 21:07.342
Nobody knows where the hell he is?

21:07.343 --> 21:09.592
Arizona.

21:09.593 --> 21:10.922
We found him.

21:10.923 --> 21:13.722
Merced Garcia is in Arizona.

21:13.723 --> 21:15.549
He's being deported.

21:19.383 --> 21:21.512
Thank you for coming in, Mr. Covington.

21:21.513 --> 21:22.842
My pleasure.

21:22.843 --> 21:24.302
You're entitled to have a lawyer present.

21:24.303 --> 21:25.362
I think I'll be okay.

21:25.363 --> 21:26.562
I'd like to ask you about

21:26.563 --> 21:28.592
the planning of this trip to Yellowstone.

21:28.593 --> 21:30.842
Because you'd like to know
if I did anything in New York

21:30.843 --> 21:32.052
in furtherance of the crime

21:32.053 --> 21:33.422
so you could establish venue here.

21:33.423 --> 21:34.682
- Yes?
- Yes.

21:34.683 --> 21:36.632
Very good.

21:36.633 --> 21:38.682
Well, Cynthia planned the trip.

21:38.683 --> 21:39.762
Entirely on her own?

21:39.763 --> 21:41.632
Yes, it was her idea.

21:41.633 --> 21:44.052
She bought the tickets,
she bought the guide books.

21:44.053 --> 21:46.262
She even bought maps.

21:46.263 --> 21:47.592
Maps.

21:47.593 --> 21:50.132
She reserved the hotel, the car.

21:50.133 --> 21:52.802
She even picked the hike, unfortunately.

21:52.803 --> 21:54.302
I'm sure you found all this

21:54.303 --> 21:58.370
in that very well-organized
stack of paper. What else?

21:58.371 --> 22:00.182
You and your wife e-mailed
one another a lot.

22:00.183 --> 22:02.422
- Yes.
- Even from inside the apartment.

22:02.423 --> 22:04.422
- Yes.
- "I heard you making food downstairs.

22:04.423 --> 22:06.722
Please don't leave your dirty
dishes in the sink. Arthur".

22:06.723 --> 22:08.592
- Uh-huh.
- "Please turn down that awful music.

22:08.593 --> 22:10.342
I have a deposition
in the morning. Arthur".

22:10.343 --> 22:11.972
I did have a deposition in the morning,

22:11.973 --> 22:13.182
- and the music was awful.
- Well...

22:13.183 --> 22:15.382
Is this really the best you can do?

22:15.383 --> 22:17.382
- What?
- I asked about you.

22:17.383 --> 22:19.842
I heard you were a rising
young star in this office

22:19.843 --> 22:22.012
despite the fact that you went
to the University of Virginia.

22:22.013 --> 22:25.223
But this is... so boring.

22:27.973 --> 22:30.012
You changed your family's cellphone plan

22:30.013 --> 22:32.182
one week before going to Yellowstone

22:32.183 --> 22:33.882
to a carrier with no reception

22:33.883 --> 22:35.922
in the area of the park
where Cynthia died

22:35.923 --> 22:37.632
because you didn't want her

22:37.633 --> 22:38.802
to be able to call for help.

22:38.803 --> 22:41.882
That's better! Yes.

22:41.883 --> 22:43.632
But I change our cellphone service

22:43.633 --> 22:45.052
every six months at exactly six months,

22:45.053 --> 22:46.092
and that's what I did here.

22:46.093 --> 22:47.382
Try again.

22:47.383 --> 22:50.132
You bought an expensive
GPS watch at the airport

22:50.133 --> 22:52.632
so you'd know you were in
the right area of the park

22:52.633 --> 22:54.472
when you pushed her over
the side of the trail.

22:54.473 --> 22:56.762
All right, first of all,
I don't appreciate that.

22:56.763 --> 22:58.052
The watch wasn't expensive.

22:58.053 --> 22:59.682
It was reasonably priced.

22:59.683 --> 23:01.592
But anyway, it was never used.

23:01.593 --> 23:02.802
Still in the box at home.

23:02.803 --> 23:05.052
Cynthia didn't like hiking.

23:05.053 --> 23:07.422
She didn't like the outdoors,
didn't like to fly.

23:07.423 --> 23:08.512
But on her own,

23:08.513 --> 23:10.802
she designs a trip across the country

23:10.803 --> 23:14.183
in order to take a perilous hike
in the backcountry?

23:17.973 --> 23:19.722
I've never liked the idea

23:19.723 --> 23:23.092
of the law as a living organism.

23:23.093 --> 23:25.842
Mutating, adapting to social change.

23:25.843 --> 23:27.422
I'm a conservative this way.

23:27.423 --> 23:28.922
The law is the law.

23:28.923 --> 23:30.802
Fixed. Immutable.

23:30.803 --> 23:32.382
Words with precise meanings.

23:32.383 --> 23:33.896
And that's good.

23:34.633 --> 23:37.222
But people change.

23:37.223 --> 23:38.922
I guess that's what Cynthia did.

23:38.923 --> 23:41.183
And you have the e-mails
right there to prove it.

23:43.263 --> 23:45.803
The trip was her idea.

23:48.303 --> 23:50.722
It's been a pleasure, Ms. Littlejohn.

23:50.723 --> 23:52.552
Thank you for stepping up.

23:52.553 --> 23:53.883
You changed, too.

23:57.013 --> 23:58.802
- How long do I have?
- I don't know.

23:58.803 --> 24:00.138
Until the deportation hearing?

24:00.139 --> 24:02.802
Tina, I don't know.

24:02.803 --> 24:04.722
They could come back anytime.

24:04.723 --> 24:06.512
If the marshals are ordered
to stand down from Justice,

24:06.513 --> 24:08.132
there's nothing I can do.

24:08.133 --> 24:10.882
For him or for you.

24:10.883 --> 24:14.552
You will lose your job
if you push this too far.

24:14.553 --> 24:15.802
Jill is sending someone to Arizona.

24:15.803 --> 24:17.133
Maybe that helps.

24:19.133 --> 24:21.382
I know how important this is to you.

24:21.383 --> 24:23.112
I feel that.

24:24.343 --> 24:25.923
But take the long view.

24:31.763 --> 24:33.434
How long do you take the long view

24:33.435 --> 24:35.788
before you can't see the little things

24:35.789 --> 24:37.513
in front of you anymore?

24:56.053 --> 24:57.552
- Covington?
- Yes.

24:57.553 --> 24:59.222
I heard.

24:59.223 --> 25:00.472
He's gonna get away with it.

25:00.473 --> 25:02.092
- A lot of people do.
- Not like this.

25:02.093 --> 25:05.262
He's using the law to commit a crime.

25:05.263 --> 25:06.472
It's a puzzle to him.

25:06.473 --> 25:08.512
A parlor game. An LSAT problem.

25:08.513 --> 25:10.052
And I'm here,

25:10.053 --> 25:11.682
and I should be able to catch him,

25:11.683 --> 25:13.682
and I can't.

25:13.683 --> 25:16.165
And I aced the LSAT.

25:17.013 --> 25:19.012
This is not what the law
is supposed to be.

25:19.013 --> 25:20.794
What's the law supposed to be?

25:21.683 --> 25:23.672
I ask that in all seriousness.

25:24.133 --> 25:26.722
Isn't it supposed to protect
a seven-year-old boy?

25:26.723 --> 25:28.722
The law is an amazing thing.

25:28.723 --> 25:29.829
It's a powerful thing.

25:29.830 --> 25:31.922
It is also incomplete.

25:31.923 --> 25:33.422
Sometimes incomprehensible.

25:33.423 --> 25:37.311
And right now, apparently,
totally messed up.

25:37.843 --> 25:40.314
So... that's us.

25:40.683 --> 25:42.232
Into the breach.

25:45.383 --> 25:47.946
Maybe you're approaching
this the wrong way.

25:48.513 --> 25:50.012
You are the smartest person I know.

25:50.013 --> 25:53.342
You are also the most human.

25:53.343 --> 25:56.422
That's not something I hear... a lot.

25:56.423 --> 25:57.882
If Covington made a mistake...

25:57.883 --> 25:59.342
and he did, somewhere, somehow...

25:59.343 --> 26:01.382
it's not because he wasn't being smart,

26:01.383 --> 26:03.754
it's because he wasn't
thinking like a human being.

26:04.263 --> 26:05.382
Don't try to outmaneuver him.

26:05.383 --> 26:06.673
Just...

26:08.303 --> 26:10.262
be you.

26:10.263 --> 26:13.842
Flesh, and blood, and beating heart.

26:24.723 --> 26:26.132
Mr. Garcia.

26:26.133 --> 26:28.682
My name is Sandra. This is Ted.

26:28.683 --> 26:31.012
We're from the Federal Public
Defender in New York.

26:31.013 --> 26:32.302
In New York?

26:32.303 --> 26:33.263
Yes.

26:33.264 --> 26:34.592
I have a son.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.472
- Ramon.
- Yes.

26:36.473 --> 26:37.722
He's okay.

26:37.723 --> 26:39.383
D-Do you know where he is?

26:40.040 --> 26:42.592
He's in the courthouse. In New York.

26:42.593 --> 26:44.837
C-Can I talk to him?

26:46.013 --> 26:47.762
They won't allow that right now.

26:47.763 --> 26:48.723
I tried.

26:48.724 --> 26:50.759
W-We will try again.

26:53.134 --> 26:55.422
I'm sorry.

26:56.723 --> 26:59.222
I want to ask you a few
questions, Mr. Garcia.

26:59.223 --> 27:01.012
For your hearing.

27:01.013 --> 27:03.647
I will represent you in your
deportation hearing, okay?

27:06.053 --> 27:08.592
When did you come into the United States?

27:08.593 --> 27:09.778
Two years ago.

27:09.779 --> 27:11.238
Mm-hmm.

27:11.683 --> 27:13.092
Are you employed?

27:13.093 --> 27:15.473
Yes, I-I work as a delivery driver.

27:17.973 --> 27:19.663
Are you married?

27:20.473 --> 27:22.875
No, my... my wife passed away.

27:29.473 --> 27:32.422
Does Ramon have any brothers or sisters?

27:32.423 --> 27:33.724
No.

27:33.725 --> 27:36.422
Does Ramon have any
specific medical conditions

27:36.423 --> 27:37.423
we should know about?

27:37.424 --> 27:38.882
No.

27:39.973 --> 27:41.263
No.

27:46.093 --> 27:48.512
Oh, no.

27:48.513 --> 27:50.262
Mijo...

27:50.263 --> 27:51.552
Mijo.

27:52.973 --> 27:54.013
Mijo.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.842
Okay, Mr. Garcia.

27:59.843 --> 28:02.013
I want you to try to get some sleep.

28:19.183 --> 28:20.599
Do you me to lie down with you?

28:23.183 --> 28:24.552
Okay.

28:31.803 --> 28:36.472
When my son was about your age,

28:36.473 --> 28:41.512
I used to read him a story
called "Amos & Boris."

28:41.513 --> 28:43.382
- Do you know it?
- No.

28:43.383 --> 28:45.342
Well, it's a fine story

28:45.343 --> 28:50.802
about the unlikely friendship
between a mouse and a whale.

28:50.803 --> 28:53.552
They became friends because one day,

28:53.553 --> 28:56.302
the little mouse decided
he wanted to build a boat,

28:56.303 --> 28:59.092
and he did, he built a boat,

28:59.093 --> 29:01.382
and then he sailed the little boat

29:01.383 --> 29:03.972
deep into the sea,

29:03.973 --> 29:07.592
and then one day,
he fell off of the boat,

29:07.593 --> 29:10.762
and the whale saved him.

29:10.763 --> 29:12.302
And for seven days,

29:12.303 --> 29:14.382
the mouse lived on the back of the whale,

29:14.383 --> 29:15.882
and they talked and ate,

29:15.883 --> 29:18.722
and the mouse ran up and down
the back of the whale,

29:18.723 --> 29:21.922
and they became great friends.

29:21.923 --> 29:23.342
The whale, Boris,

29:23.343 --> 29:25.882
finally dropped the mouse off
on the beach,

29:25.883 --> 29:29.092
and they thought they'd never
see each other again.

29:29.093 --> 29:31.211
But years later,

29:32.093 --> 29:34.881
the whale got caught up
in a great big storm

29:35.513 --> 29:38.882
and he ended up stranded on the beach,

29:38.883 --> 29:43.342
and the mouse, Amos, found him,

29:43.343 --> 29:46.472
and they remembered each other,
of course,

29:46.473 --> 29:51.422
and the mouse, with the help
of two friendly elephants,

29:51.423 --> 29:57.592
the mouse pushed the whale
back into the sea.

30:04.133 --> 30:06.371
And they were very sad

30:08.692 --> 30:10.982
because they had to say goodbye again.

30:14.093 --> 30:18.682
But happy because they knew
they would be friends forever.

30:18.683 --> 30:23.262
They knew they would never
forget each other.

30:29.923 --> 30:31.875
"I have a deposition in
the morning. Arthur."

30:31.876 --> 30:35.330
"I told you. I don't like soup. Arthur."

30:35.355 --> 30:37.774
"I would like to have sex
this morning after breakfast.

30:37.775 --> 30:39.404
Ar... thur."

30:39.405 --> 30:41.154
- Not my business.
- Arthur would like to have sex

30:41.155 --> 30:42.194
this morning after breakfast.

30:42.195 --> 30:43.564
If it works for the two of you...

30:43.565 --> 30:46.564
Arthur! It's an e-mail
from Arthur Covington.

30:46.565 --> 30:48.564
I really wouldn't get involved with him.

30:48.565 --> 30:50.654
- Look what happened to his wife.
- This is his e-mail!

30:50.655 --> 30:52.694
He signs all of his e-mails "Arthur."

30:52.695 --> 30:55.921
Arthur, Arthur, Arthur, Arthur...

30:57.445 --> 30:58.904
Arthur!

30:58.905 --> 31:00.904
Mr. Covington, you have agreed to appear

31:00.905 --> 31:03.774
before this federal Grand Jury
voluntarily, correct?

31:03.775 --> 31:05.904
- Yes.
- And you are aware, Mr. Covington,

31:05.905 --> 31:07.854
that we are investigating
the circumstances

31:07.855 --> 31:09.614
of the death of your wife, Cynthia,

31:09.615 --> 31:12.194
- in Yellowstone National Park, correct?
- Yes.

31:12.195 --> 31:14.848
Whose idea was it to take
this trip to Yellowstone?

31:14.849 --> 31:15.934
Cynthia's.

31:15.935 --> 31:18.064
And do you recall how
or when she raised the idea?

31:18.065 --> 31:19.854
She sent me an e-mail about it.

31:19.855 --> 31:22.314
I don't know the exact date.

31:22.315 --> 31:24.444
I want to direct your attention
to this e-mail,

31:24.445 --> 31:26.774
which I will mark as Exhibit 1.

31:26.775 --> 31:29.524
"Honey, why don't we go to Yellowstone?

31:29.525 --> 31:31.194
For our anniversary?

31:31.195 --> 31:33.234
I've always wanted to see it.

31:33.235 --> 31:34.314
Can we do it?

31:34.315 --> 31:36.314
Cynthia."

31:36.315 --> 31:38.271
Is this the e-mail that
you are referring to?

31:38.296 --> 31:39.484
Yes.

31:39.485 --> 31:41.694
Now, you and Cynthia regularly
corresponded by e-mail.

31:41.695 --> 31:43.194
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

31:43.195 --> 31:44.944
Even for regular, day-to-day activities?

31:44.945 --> 31:47.774
- Y-Yes.
- So, for example...

31:47.775 --> 31:49.564
"I heard the doorbell downstairs,

31:49.565 --> 31:51.024
if there's a package for me,

31:51.025 --> 31:53.654
please leave it outside my bedroom door.

31:53.655 --> 31:54.984
Arthur."

31:54.985 --> 31:56.564
You wrote that?

31:56.565 --> 31:58.024
Yes.

31:58.025 --> 31:59.904
So, in your mind, there's nothing unusual

31:59.905 --> 32:02.444
about the e-mail Cynthia sent to you

32:02.445 --> 32:04.354
proposing the trip to Yellowstone?

32:04.355 --> 32:06.774
It's, um...

32:06.775 --> 32:09.654
Well, uh, it is written in Comic Sans,

32:09.655 --> 32:11.524
but that was Cynthia's favorite font.

32:11.525 --> 32:14.114
In fact, Mr. Covington,

32:14.115 --> 32:16.024
the e-mail Cynthia allegedly sent you

32:16.025 --> 32:17.524
proposing the Yellowstone trip

32:17.525 --> 32:19.404
is highly unusual, is it not,

32:19.405 --> 32:21.354
because that e-mail

32:21.355 --> 32:25.354
is the only e-mail of the 1,162 e-mails

32:25.355 --> 32:27.854
sent from Cynthia's account to you

32:27.855 --> 32:30.814
in which she signed her name?

32:30.815 --> 32:32.694
I don't see any significance in that.

32:32.695 --> 32:35.154
You signed your name to every e-mail

32:35.155 --> 32:37.114
- you wrote to Cynthia, right?
- Y-Yes.

32:37.115 --> 32:38.944
And she never signed her name

32:38.945 --> 32:40.984
to any e-mail she wrote to you

32:40.985 --> 32:42.441
except for the one e-mail

32:42.442 --> 32:43.861
in which she proposed taking the trip

32:43.862 --> 32:45.161
on which she was killed.

32:45.162 --> 32:46.854
I think the significance of that

32:46.855 --> 32:48.354
is that you wrote that e-mail.

32:48.355 --> 32:50.510
- That's not true!
- No?

32:50.511 --> 32:53.154
We checked Cynthia's cell tower records,

32:53.155 --> 32:55.194
and she was nowhere near
her home computer

32:55.195 --> 32:56.653
when this e-mail was sent.

32:56.654 --> 32:57.851
But you were.

32:58.577 --> 33:00.944
Isn't it true, Mr. Covington,

33:00.945 --> 33:03.154
that you planned to murder your wife

33:03.155 --> 33:05.944
in a place where you knew
you could never be prosecuted?

33:05.945 --> 33:07.484
No.

33:07.485 --> 33:09.114
That you knew the only way

33:09.115 --> 33:10.854
you could be prosecuted for the crime

33:10.855 --> 33:12.354
was if there was evidence

33:12.355 --> 33:14.412
you planned the crime
from somewhere else.

33:14.413 --> 33:15.500
No.

33:15.525 --> 33:17.854
That in order to remove
any doubt that you

33:17.855 --> 33:20.354
did not plan this trip to Yellowstone

33:20.355 --> 33:23.734
in order to murder your wife,
you logged on to her computer

33:23.735 --> 33:26.524
and e-mailed the suggestion to yourself.

33:26.525 --> 33:28.484
But you made a mistake, didn't you?

33:28.485 --> 33:30.194
You signed her name.

33:30.195 --> 33:33.024
You forgot, or maybe you
never even realized

33:33.025 --> 33:36.484
that normal people
who write normal e-mails

33:36.485 --> 33:37.654
to their loved ones

33:37.655 --> 33:40.877
don't sign their name every single time.

33:43.025 --> 33:45.683
I like words with precise meanings, too,

33:45.684 --> 33:47.256
so listen carefully, Arthur...

33:47.257 --> 33:52.234
You are going to need a lawyer.

33:59.235 --> 34:01.505
Your Honor, Sandra Bell
on behalf of Mr. Garcia.

34:01.506 --> 34:02.571
Leslie Hammond

34:02.572 --> 34:04.363
for Immigration and
Customs Enforcement, Your Honor.

34:04.364 --> 34:05.904
- Ms. Bell.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

34:05.905 --> 34:07.274
We are asking for bond for Mr. Garcia

34:07.275 --> 34:09.114
in the amount of $1,500.

34:09.114 --> 34:11.024
Mr. Garcia has no prior arrests
in the United States,

34:11.025 --> 34:12.694
no arrests or criminal
convictions in Guatemala.

34:12.695 --> 34:14.444
He was a cooperating witness

34:14.445 --> 34:15.904
in a federal prosecution in New York.

34:15.905 --> 34:18.234
He appeared in that case voluntarily.

34:18.235 --> 34:20.984
Mr. Garcia is the sole caretaker
of his seven-year-old son.

34:20.985 --> 34:22.904
Mr. Garcia poses no threat
to the community,

34:22.905 --> 34:25.404
- he's not a flight risk...
- He is a flight risk, Your Honor,

34:25.405 --> 34:27.063
because he has no plausible
relief from deportation,

34:27.065 --> 34:28.944
and therefore, no incentive to reappear.

34:28.945 --> 34:30.484
He has every incentive to reappear

34:30.485 --> 34:32.234
because he not only has a plausible case

34:32.235 --> 34:33.274
for relief from deportation,

34:33.275 --> 34:34.484
he has a strong case.

34:34.485 --> 34:35.694
And he wants to make that case,

34:35.695 --> 34:36.853
and he will make that case.

34:36.855 --> 34:37.944
I will make that case.

34:37.945 --> 34:39.353
But this is a bond hearing.

34:39.355 --> 34:40.563
And factors for bond

34:40.565 --> 34:42.922
are threat to the community
and flight risk,

34:42.924 --> 34:44.043
and there is nothing
in Mr. Garcia's record that...

34:44.043 --> 34:45.190
Thank you, Ms. Bell.

34:45.985 --> 34:47.734
Bond is denied.

34:47.735 --> 34:49.274
You can call the next case.

34:49.275 --> 34:50.984
Your Honor, Mr. Garcia...

34:50.985 --> 34:52.694
I've issued my ruling, Ms. Bell.

34:52.695 --> 34:54.234
Mr. Garcia has a son

34:54.235 --> 34:56.063
who will be separated from his father...

34:56.065 --> 34:58.654
Then Mr. Garcia should've
thought about that

34:58.655 --> 35:02.694
when he crossed over the border
illegally with his child.

35:02.695 --> 35:05.354
I've issued my ruling. Bond is denied.

35:05.355 --> 35:06.814
One more word out of you

35:06.815 --> 35:08.354
and I will hold you
in contempt, Ms. Bell.

35:08.355 --> 35:09.525
One more word.

35:12.275 --> 35:13.905
One more word.

35:16.815 --> 35:18.314
Call the next case.

35:21.956 --> 35:24.791
I've complained to ICE,
to the Secretary directly.

35:24.816 --> 35:26.394
We can hope this won't happen again,

35:26.419 --> 35:27.458
but we're at the end of the line now.

35:27.459 --> 35:28.459
You can make a call...

35:28.460 --> 35:30.458
The call has been made, Roger.

35:30.459 --> 35:32.838
It has come in. From Washington.

35:32.839 --> 35:34.048
This needs to be cleaned up.

35:34.049 --> 35:35.508
They're not gonna have a standoff

35:35.509 --> 35:36.919
in the courthouse anymore.

35:38.799 --> 35:41.008
They're going to take the boy.

35:41.009 --> 35:42.958
Then it won't just be the boy.

35:48.629 --> 35:50.131
They're on their way?

35:51.739 --> 35:53.279
Soon.

35:55.009 --> 35:57.718
I don't understand what's happening here.

35:57.719 --> 35:59.265
What country is this?

36:00.339 --> 36:01.548
This is America.

36:01.549 --> 36:03.687
This is not the America I know.

36:04.089 --> 36:06.218
When I came here with my family,

36:06.219 --> 36:07.718
we had nothing, and we struggled,

36:07.719 --> 36:10.718
but we built a life here,
and we were welcome here.

36:10.719 --> 36:14.008
For years, my dad kept this
little picture of Ronald Reagan

36:14.009 --> 36:17.236
above our kitchen table,
with these quotes from him.

36:17.237 --> 36:18.838
About immigrants.

36:18.839 --> 36:20.758
"These families came here to work.

36:20.759 --> 36:22.508
They came to build.

36:22.509 --> 36:24.918
They brought with them courage, ambition,

36:24.919 --> 36:28.548
and the values of family."

36:28.549 --> 36:30.463
That is the America I know.

36:33.009 --> 36:36.636
I am an immigrant.
I am the child of immigrants.

36:38.365 --> 36:39.945
We were welcome here.

36:41.459 --> 36:43.810
And today you probably wouldn't be.

36:45.549 --> 36:47.439
This is America.

36:47.959 --> 36:50.548
It expands and it contracts.

36:50.549 --> 36:53.298
Advances and recedes.

36:53.299 --> 36:56.740
Opens and closes.

36:57.509 --> 36:59.668
This is a country birthed in freedom

36:59.669 --> 37:01.718
and built on slavery.

37:01.719 --> 37:03.913
Separating families?

37:05.219 --> 37:09.627
They separated black families
in America for 250 years.

37:10.509 --> 37:15.008
What makes this feel so bad now
is that we expect more.

37:15.009 --> 37:16.628
And that's a good thing.

37:16.629 --> 37:18.878
This pain is progress.

37:18.879 --> 37:23.878
But do not forget who we are
and where we came from.

37:23.879 --> 37:27.718
I do not forget where I came from.

37:27.719 --> 37:29.878
I grew up in West Baltimore,

37:29.879 --> 37:31.895
around the corner from where
Justice Marshall grew up.

37:31.896 --> 37:35.695
This Justice Marshall.

37:36.589 --> 37:38.088
He knew my father.

37:38.089 --> 37:40.408
He stood in my living room.

37:41.299 --> 37:43.008
The elementary school I went to,
Mt. Royal,

37:43.009 --> 37:44.088
I went to because of him.

37:44.089 --> 37:50.048
I'm here because of him.

37:50.049 --> 37:52.718
He was the grandson of a slave,

37:52.719 --> 37:55.008
and he changed American law.

37:55.009 --> 37:58.168
He changed the very idea
of the Constitution!

37:58.169 --> 38:00.258
He made a document

38:00.259 --> 38:03.508
that considered him three-fifths of a man

38:03.509 --> 38:05.508
a document of liberation.

38:05.509 --> 38:09.020
This is the America I know.

38:11.589 --> 38:13.919
A beacon and a curse.

38:14.442 --> 38:16.258
Light and darkness.

38:16.259 --> 38:17.918
Hope and despair.

38:23.219 --> 38:25.419
This is America right now.

38:28.419 --> 38:32.298
But America never ends.

38:43.219 --> 38:45.048
Mr. Knox.

38:45.049 --> 38:47.933
- This isn't what we agreed to.
- What?

38:47.934 --> 38:49.418
Mr. Boyd's gun possession
not being considered

38:49.419 --> 38:51.392
"relevant conduct" under
the sentencing guidelines.

38:51.393 --> 38:53.258
I specifically said "no" to that.

38:53.259 --> 38:55.918
- That's not what I remember.
- Yes, it is.

38:55.919 --> 38:57.218
You're just trying to reopen the deal

38:57.219 --> 38:58.378
by misrepresenting the conversation,

38:58.379 --> 39:01.008
hoping you can do just a
little bit better this time,

39:01.009 --> 39:02.258
but I'm not in the mood for that,

39:02.259 --> 39:03.718
and if you want to press me on it,

39:03.719 --> 39:06.128
I will withdraw the offer
and we will go to trial.

39:06.129 --> 39:07.799
Do you want to press me on it?

39:09.719 --> 39:12.169
You waited too long.
The offer is withdrawn.

39:20.299 --> 39:21.458
You want me to bring him back?

39:21.459 --> 39:22.668
I need him as a witness.

39:22.669 --> 39:23.629
That case is over.

39:23.630 --> 39:24.799
The plea deal fell apart.

39:25.919 --> 39:28.718
The plea deal fell apart. I...

39:28.719 --> 39:29.958
I am trying this case.

39:29.959 --> 39:32.168
I'm going to try it,
and I'm going to win.

39:32.169 --> 39:33.548
I will win.

39:33.549 --> 39:35.418
And since Merced Garcia
is a material witness,

39:35.419 --> 39:36.798
after I win,

39:36.799 --> 39:39.218
you can take your time
sentencing Mr. Boyd,

39:39.219 --> 39:40.958
and Merced will have to be here
for as long as that takes.

39:40.959 --> 39:42.378
It could be years,

39:42.379 --> 39:44.298
and you can order ICE not to take Ramon

39:44.299 --> 39:45.508
because you have determined

39:45.509 --> 39:47.218
that it's essential
to Merced's well-being

39:47.219 --> 39:48.838
not to be separated from his son.

39:48.839 --> 39:51.918
And it is within your
supervisory powers as a Judge

39:51.919 --> 39:54.709
to care for witnesses in this way.

39:55.419 --> 39:58.879
Those are your indisputable,
inviolable powers.

40:01.169 --> 40:02.919
This is what I'm going to do.

40:04.589 --> 40:07.138
It's not my case, Mr. Knox.

40:08.509 --> 40:10.308
Then take it.

40:11.129 --> 40:13.561
Go to Judge Reed and take it.

40:15.089 --> 40:17.168
Because you can do that, too.

40:42.549 --> 40:44.128
Mr. Garcia, sir?

40:49.669 --> 40:52.508
It has been an honor

40:52.509 --> 40:56.299
to have you here
in my office, Mr. Garcia.

40:56.843 --> 40:59.088
Wherever you go.

40:59.089 --> 41:03.298
Wherever you go.

41:03.299 --> 41:05.905
You have a home here.

41:06.299 --> 41:07.668
You are a child,

41:07.669 --> 41:11.299
you are a beautiful boy,

41:11.703 --> 41:13.878
and you are welcome here.
