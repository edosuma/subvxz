WEBVTT

00:08.801 --> 00:10.385
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:10.469 --> 00:12.136
Lenny slid the ring on.

00:12.221 --> 00:14.722
Maybe Lenny's not the one.

00:15.057 --> 00:16.516
l have a present.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.601
You're not related to him in any way.

00:18.894 --> 00:21.896
Steer clear of my bloodline.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.023
Jackie was fucking me.

00:25.567 --> 00:28.569
He was in here. He was making a list
of the shit that you were on.

00:28.654 --> 00:29.654
He what?

00:29.738 --> 00:30.988
You've been served.

00:31.073 --> 00:32.240
He is suing for custody.

01:40.642 --> 01:43.644
Dr. Cooper, you are a great-looking guy.

01:44.021 --> 01:46.314
Girls are gonna be lining up to date you.

01:47.733 --> 01:50.026
But l don't want to be with them.
l want to be with you.

01:50.110 --> 01:54.280
l can't be with you or anyone
until l've been on my own.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.658
l have to build a life for myself, otherwise

01:58.744 --> 02:03.080
l won't have a life to share
with you or anyone else.

02:03.165 --> 02:06.876
Hold on. "Build a life."

02:09.838 --> 02:11.589
l am not a good breaker-upper.

02:11.882 --> 02:15.218
You said he's not the one,
so you have to let him go.

02:17.513 --> 02:20.264
Whoa, that hurt.

02:21.767 --> 02:23.601
But l am totally fine.

02:23.936 --> 02:25.311
That was good. You're good.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.021
lt's an art form.

02:28.565 --> 02:31.818
l've been dumped 1 ,000 times.
That was easily top 1 0. Maybe top three.

02:32.319 --> 02:35.321
Weird. As soon as he proposed,
l knew it was over.

02:36.031 --> 02:39.408
Now every day l wear the ring
feels like some big fat lie right on my finger.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.620
Well, don't wait.
Cricket waited and l got left at the altar.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.163
Not cool.

02:45.207 --> 02:46.499
Anyone seen Jackie?

02:46.583 --> 02:47.750
l think she's at a meeting.

02:47.835 --> 02:51.128
Not like a "meeting," but like a meeting.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.881
When she decides to show up,
tell her l want to see her.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.551
And you're still doing that thing.

02:57.719 --> 02:58.761
What thing?

02:58.846 --> 03:00.388
You know that thing you do.

03:02.099 --> 03:03.599
You're doing the right thing.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.060
You okay?

03:07.563 --> 03:08.729
l'm all right.

03:10.732 --> 03:12.358
-Eleanor?
-Laurel.

03:15.654 --> 03:18.406
Spanx are a fucking miracle
until they go rogue on you.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.491
You must be Jackie Peyton.

03:20.576 --> 03:22.869
Laurel Vargas. Let's get you divorced.

03:23.579 --> 03:25.788
Gotta admit, l'm a little nervous.
lt's my first divorce.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.165
Yeah, well, it's my 21 1th,
so you're in good hands.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.458
Been doing this a long time?

03:29.543 --> 03:33.421
Even the small talk's $750 an hour,
how about we stick to your divorce?

03:33.797 --> 03:35.298
lt's gonna be an uphill battle.

03:35.382 --> 03:38.634
Rehab, chronic infidelity,
60-hour work weeks.

03:39.011 --> 03:40.177
l'm a nurse. Those are the hours.

03:40.262 --> 03:43.014
Just out of treatment,
working around narcotics.

03:43.098 --> 03:45.600
The judge is gonna look at that,
you know what he's gonna say?

03:45.684 --> 03:48.561
"Hang around the barbershop long enough,
you're bound to get a haircut."

03:48.645 --> 03:50.730
l am totally committed to my sobriety.

03:50.814 --> 03:51.898
lt's a little late to the party.

03:51.982 --> 03:53.774
-l got there when l got there.
-Not good enough.

03:54.109 --> 03:56.152
We need to improve your profile.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.905
You need to go
to as many AA meetings as possible,

03:58.989 --> 04:01.032
and you need to get them documented.

04:01.116 --> 04:03.701
Every meeting you go to, you get it signed.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.913
And you need to get character references
from powerful people.

04:06.997 --> 04:09.916
Not rinky-dink nurses
or your friends from the book club.

04:10.167 --> 04:14.045
l'm talking doctors, bigwigs, mayors.

04:14.129 --> 04:15.296
Pull out all the stops.

04:15.547 --> 04:16.923
Astronauts.

04:17.466 --> 04:18.549
$750.

04:18.842 --> 04:21.802
Now at the same time
that we are building you up,

04:22.346 --> 04:26.974
we need to demonstrate
that Kevin is an unfit custodian.

04:27.059 --> 04:29.018
Well, he's great with the kids.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.480
Yeah, and every kind word on his behalf
is a week without your kids. You got it?

04:35.984 --> 04:36.984
Yes.

04:39.071 --> 04:40.363
You want your kids or not?

04:41.365 --> 04:42.990
You want to keep the house?

04:44.493 --> 04:48.120
Okay, then does your husband have
a problem with drugs or alcohol?

04:48.997 --> 04:49.997
No.

04:50.499 --> 04:51.958
Money issues?

04:52.167 --> 04:54.502
-No.
-He's asking for child support, so yes.

04:54.753 --> 04:56.379
No, he's not broke. He owns a bar.

04:56.463 --> 04:59.882
A bar? l can't think
of a worse environment for a kid.

05:00.217 --> 05:01.467
See how that works?

05:01.551 --> 05:02.885
How about a history of violence?

05:03.095 --> 05:04.971
Violence, like does he hit me? No.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.097
That's not what she asked.

05:06.181 --> 05:08.766
Come on, work with me.
A history of violence.

05:09.559 --> 05:12.853
Ripping kids away from their mother,
violent.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.313
Maybe there's more where that came from.

05:14.398 --> 05:17.984
No, you're making him sound
like a monster and he's not.

05:19.861 --> 05:22.071
You think he's not doing
the same thing about you?

05:25.200 --> 05:26.534
Think hard.

05:39.798 --> 05:42.383
Holy shit. Check you out.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.427
Go ahead, get it out of your system.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.303
You look so pretty.

05:46.388 --> 05:47.805
Damn, get it, girl.

05:47.889 --> 05:51.017
Cruz is looking for you.
But be careful, he's being prickly.

05:56.690 --> 05:57.773
You clean up nice.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.400
Needed you in trauma half an hour ago.
You're late.

05:59.484 --> 06:01.485
l had a meeting
with my divorce lawyer that ran late.

06:01.570 --> 06:03.904
-You didn't clear it with me.
-l was supposed to be out of there but...

06:03.989 --> 06:05.740
You were supposed to be here.

06:07.242 --> 06:10.745
l don't know if you think
there are two separate set of rules.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.167
You okay?

06:16.251 --> 06:18.961
Allergies, pollen, hay fever.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.881
Not that time of year. Asthma?

06:22.549 --> 06:24.925
-Did l leave my stethoscope in there?
-No.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.010
Are you sure?

06:26.094 --> 06:29.346
l understand, Dr. Cruz, you're right.
l should have called. l'm sorry.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.600
You okay?

06:32.684 --> 06:34.685
Stress. Hard on my chest.

06:34.770 --> 06:36.062
Breathe through your nose.

06:36.313 --> 06:37.313
Almost there.

06:40.650 --> 06:41.734
Take your time.

06:42.027 --> 06:45.112
Here's the deal.
That back there? Family stuff.

06:45.989 --> 06:47.865
Family can't get in the way of work.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.910
lf l'm focused on my kid,
l'm not focused on my work.

06:51.161 --> 06:54.747
Home is home. Work is work.
Keep the boundaries clean.

06:55.957 --> 06:57.208
l get it.

06:57.292 --> 06:59.043
And thanks for that, by the way.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.128
-Yeah, you owe me one.
-No, l don't.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.965
That works, too.

07:13.892 --> 07:16.310
l need your help
with a non-emergent cardiology patient.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.020
-What's up?
-Old friend, Dick Babbit.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.855
Used to work here. ln for an angioplasty.

07:19.940 --> 07:23.400
His daughter called and asked if l'd keep
an eye on him till she gets here.

07:23.485 --> 07:25.027
Apparently, he's got dementia.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.445
That's rough.

07:26.530 --> 07:31.283
She's afraid he's gonna wander off.
Such a shame. Smart as a whip.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.670
First male nurse, big man on campus.
Girls were nuts about him.

07:42.754 --> 07:45.131
-Yeah?
-Yeah, back in 1 9...

07:46.466 --> 07:47.925
This place was crawling with lvy Leaguers.

07:48.009 --> 07:51.011
Most of the nurses were Upper East Siders
looking to get married.

07:51.096 --> 07:53.597
Not me, though. l was here to work.
Same as Dick.

07:54.391 --> 07:55.599
God, it was fun.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.017
You guys an item?

07:59.563 --> 08:01.188
He was always a gentleman.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.273
Gloria.

08:02.357 --> 08:05.568
Well, l can't deny
there was a certain electricity.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.864
Why are we on maternity?

08:13.243 --> 08:14.243
Dick?

08:15.662 --> 08:17.454
Good morning, Gloria.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.333
Let's get you a robe.

08:22.878 --> 08:24.503
Where's my uniform?

08:24.880 --> 08:26.797
Dick, you know we're at All Saints.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.757
Of course, we're at All Saints.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.177
Has no one told you that you're a patient?

08:32.429 --> 08:33.429
Pardon me?

08:33.513 --> 08:35.222
Can you tell me what year it is?

08:35.724 --> 08:39.018
1 974. l think.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.856
Let me check my checkbook.

08:45.317 --> 08:46.817
Do we even tell him?

08:47.027 --> 08:49.904
He's got people telling him
he's wrong 24 hours a day.

08:50.572 --> 08:52.239
Let's not be them.

08:52.324 --> 08:54.200
Nurse for a day. 1 974.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.453
Much less likely to wander away.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.497
We'll keep him down here
till his daughter arrives.

09:00.582 --> 09:03.334
Someone will have to be with him
at all times. Spread the word.

09:03.418 --> 09:04.752
Consider it spread.

09:06.087 --> 09:09.590
Dick, any chance you could jump in,
ride shotgun?

09:10.217 --> 09:12.676
What do you think l'm here for? Of course.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.679
By the way,
did you get home all right last night?

09:15.764 --> 09:20.184
l made a fondue.
We had Harvey Wallbangers.

09:20.644 --> 09:23.020
We watched Love, American Style.

09:24.356 --> 09:26.148
And l said l was gonna walk you home.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.400
You know what? l took a cab.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.695
l'm gonna go get you a fresh uniform.
Back in a flash.

09:33.323 --> 09:34.573
Foxy lady.

09:34.658 --> 09:37.743
Yes, all right, then. Sam. Sam.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.495
-Yo.
-Meet Dick.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.999
He's gonna be on the floor with us today.
You are not to let him out of your sight.

09:44.084 --> 09:47.211
-Okay. Welcome. How you doing?
-How do you do?

09:48.964 --> 09:53.133
Sam, l need you to do me a favor.
Can you hop on this trauma for me?

09:53.218 --> 09:55.970
lf l stand next to Lenny,
he'll totally pick up on my break-up vibes.

09:56.054 --> 09:57.304
-No, he won't.
-Yes, he will.

09:57.389 --> 10:00.474
Even my body language sucks at lying.
Don't think l'm a bad person.

10:01.184 --> 10:02.309
Dick.

10:02.686 --> 10:03.769
Let's go.

10:06.314 --> 10:09.149
Hey, meet Dave Tyler.
Teaches science down at Stuyvesant.

10:09.234 --> 10:11.860
Fell off a chair. Twisted his ankle.
Might be sprained.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.696
Probably not.

10:14.572 --> 10:15.823
Can you tell me what happened, Mr. Tyler?

10:15.907 --> 10:18.367
So embarrassed.
l was standing on my desk chair,

10:18.451 --> 10:20.828
putting the class iguana back on the shelf
and l fell.

10:21.496 --> 10:23.038
Can you follow my finger, Mr. Tyler?

10:23.123 --> 10:25.374
Call me Dave. Honestly, guys, l'm fine.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.960
Principal has to call an ambulance.
lt's in the manual.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.837
Skittish about lawsuits?

10:29.921 --> 10:31.588
Clean bill of health
will get you back to your class.

10:31.673 --> 10:34.466
Like l'd ever sue my school.
l'm the cool guy.

10:34.718 --> 10:37.344
-The play-Floyd-on my ukulele guy.
-Nice.

10:37.429 --> 10:39.471
Thor, let's get Dave
5 milligrams of morphine.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.348
No, thanks, really.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.767
On my count. One, two, three.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.645
Oh, shit!

10:47.272 --> 10:48.939
-What did you do?
-Sam.

10:49.024 --> 10:50.107
Dude, it's your gurney.

10:50.859 --> 10:53.068
l'm fine. lt's okay. No, l'm good.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.361
lt's your fucking ER.

10:54.446 --> 10:55.696
Why you always gotta come at me with that?

10:55.780 --> 10:57.114
-No fighting!
-Quiet!

10:57.198 --> 10:59.241
Thank you. Board and collar.

11:00.035 --> 11:02.536
-l'm good.
-Just hang on.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.373
Nope, it hurts to breathe.

11:06.541 --> 11:07.791
Ribs could be broken.
Could have punctured a lung.

11:07.876 --> 11:10.377
Let's get him upstairs for a scan,
head of the line.

11:10.462 --> 11:12.379
Flag on the play, bleeding.

11:12.630 --> 11:15.049
Shit, you guys. Let's go, let's go.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.383
Easy, easy.

11:17.135 --> 11:18.552
How we doing, Dave?

11:18.845 --> 11:20.220
Kind of want that morphine now.

11:22.724 --> 11:25.309
Up, and don't drop him this time.

11:26.227 --> 11:27.227
What the hell are we doing?

11:27.312 --> 11:31.857
Do you see any spots, floaters or tracers?

11:32.192 --> 11:35.277
Maybe. l mean, you got a light
shining right in my face.

11:36.905 --> 11:39.865
Look left. Now a little to your right.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.116
Z-Pak.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.702
-Are you two playing doctor?
-No fucking clue.

11:43.787 --> 11:46.205
l'm not so sure
Kevin didn't detach Eddie's retina.

11:46.289 --> 11:48.415
-Do not start making shit up.
-l'm not doing this.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.584
You sit down. l'm not making shit up.

11:50.835 --> 11:53.253
His retina is partially detached.
See for yourself.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.672
lt does seem a little blurry.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.091
Great. We can add that to the wreckage.

11:57.175 --> 12:01.011
Look, it's gonna heal. l'm gonna be fine.
He's my friend, so...

12:01.096 --> 12:03.555
Really? Kevin's your friend?
He beat the shit out of you, Eddie.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.808
l got in a few licks of my own.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.184
You slept with his wife.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.436
Trust me, l'll tell you now,
you are dead to him.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.980
He is not your friend, Eddie.
lf anybody's your friend, it's Jackie.

12:12.941 --> 12:14.066
l wouldn't go so far as to say that.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.402
-Yeah, well, me neither.
-Oh, for God's sake!

12:16.486 --> 12:18.987
Think of the things you've forgiven
each other for. Honestly.

12:22.283 --> 12:25.160
Your husband did this to your friend.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.790
Show your lawyer.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.085
Two adults for Serpico.

12:40.844 --> 12:42.386
Thor, this is Dick.

12:42.470 --> 12:46.265
This is Gloria's friend from cardiology.
l have to run out for an hour.

12:46.433 --> 12:47.558
Nice to meet you.

12:47.642 --> 12:49.101
-Thor, is it?
-Yes.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.561
He does not leave your side.

12:50.645 --> 12:51.812
Loud and clear.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.442
So how long have you known Gloria?

12:56.693 --> 12:59.987
Long enough to know you're not her type.
She likes pilots.

13:00.321 --> 13:01.655
Good to know.

13:02.866 --> 13:05.492
They told me l'd never get
my real estate license back,

13:06.244 --> 13:07.828
but that fire didn't start itself.

13:07.912 --> 13:11.665
You drag me to a meeting on my birthday?
l'm 1 8. l should be with strippers.

13:12.917 --> 13:15.502
Just let me get this signed,
l'll take you out to lunch.

13:16.045 --> 13:17.421
Shh!

13:17.505 --> 13:18.547
You, shh!

13:25.388 --> 13:26.597
But

13:27.474 --> 13:31.018
with my meetings and yoga practice,
l mean, l...

13:32.479 --> 13:36.607
l have days when l still feel weak,
but that's why l come see you guys, right?

13:39.694 --> 13:41.528
Jesus Christ! ldiot.

13:41.613 --> 13:43.363
-Shit.
-What the fuck was that?

13:43.448 --> 13:45.199
Hey, you two, out!

13:49.996 --> 13:50.996
Moron.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.999
l'm so sorry. Would you mind signing this
before l go? l just have to...

13:54.083 --> 13:55.167
Out!

13:58.004 --> 14:00.380
Damn it, Charlie. l needed that signature.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.092
Don't freak out, okay?
There was Vicodin in the smoothie.

14:05.470 --> 14:08.096
Are you fucking kidding me?
Do not tell me that, Charlie.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.349
You only took a sip.
l didn't realize that you'd even picked it up.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.726
-l wouldn't have let you, l swear.
-God damn it.

14:13.061 --> 14:15.479
-Look, it's only one sip. lt's not gonna be...
-God damn it! We're done!

14:15.563 --> 14:16.980
Charlie, we are done.

14:18.483 --> 14:19.900
l am trying to keep my kids.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.235
l'm sorry.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.445
l try to slip away like l was never there.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.406
That's not helpful.
l'm collecting break-up speeches.

14:26.908 --> 14:28.450
My method is speechless.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.037
Where is the ipecac?

14:32.121 --> 14:33.872
What's the matter?
Somebody swallow poison?

14:36.584 --> 14:37.709
Yep.

14:51.683 --> 14:53.016
All clear!

14:54.143 --> 14:55.686
We have a heartbeat.

14:56.187 --> 14:58.605
And no broken ribs. lmpressive.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.440
Right? Thank you.

15:01.276 --> 15:03.735
l don't think we've met. Mike Cruz.

15:03.820 --> 15:08.198
Oh, my God, where are my manners?
Dick Babbit from cardiology.

15:08.533 --> 15:10.158
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

15:10.785 --> 15:15.080
l'll leave you two to get him upstairs.
And, Dick, you need an lD badge.

15:15.790 --> 15:17.791
Whoa, indeed l do.

15:19.544 --> 15:23.964
That tie is a little narrow. Don't you think?

15:25.300 --> 15:26.717
Wouldn't wider be better?

15:27.677 --> 15:28.969
Wider is always better.

15:29.971 --> 15:31.680
l'll be in surgery.

15:33.016 --> 15:34.016
Wait, Dick.

15:36.019 --> 15:39.396
Sorry, kids keep texting,
making sure l'm okay.

15:39.814 --> 15:41.148
"Save Tyler!"

15:42.984 --> 15:45.402
And we're done.

15:46.321 --> 15:48.030
How bad does it look?

15:48.114 --> 15:51.074
You realize l stand with my back
to a room full of seventh graders.

15:51.159 --> 15:53.910
Stitches make you cooler.
Satisfaction or your money back.

15:53.995 --> 15:56.079
l kind of think it should be on the house.

15:56.581 --> 15:57.706
l mean, you did drop me.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.000
Dr. Cooper, a moment, please.

16:04.172 --> 16:06.173
-ls that the guy they dropped?
-Yeah.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.217
Did l hear you talking about
treating him for free?

16:09.761 --> 16:11.470
He brought it up, not me.

16:11.554 --> 16:15.015
You are in no way to acknowledge
that he was dropped. Are we clear?

16:15.350 --> 16:16.933
Okay, but he's not a lawsuit kind of guy.

16:17.018 --> 16:18.727
l'm sure his lawyer is. Back to it.

16:19.562 --> 16:21.021
-And, Coop.
-Yeah?

16:21.689 --> 16:23.023
Ease up on the buddy-buddy.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.609
You and your pathological need
to be liked are gonna get us sued.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.819
Shut it down.
Stitch him up and cut him loose.

16:34.285 --> 16:36.119
ls he giving you shit about dropping me?

16:36.371 --> 16:38.705
Nah, just my boss being bossy.

16:43.795 --> 16:45.170
Listen up.

16:46.589 --> 16:48.548
Regarding the gurney transfer,

16:49.550 --> 16:52.511
there is to be no talk of EMTs versus nurses.

16:52.595 --> 16:53.970
Babbit, quit futzing.

16:54.055 --> 16:57.349
l'm trying to straighten up
for the night shift.

16:57.725 --> 16:58.725
Sit!

17:02.814 --> 17:06.817
No one is to use words like "accident,"
"mistake" or "blame."

17:06.901 --> 17:09.236
You think before you speak. Am l clear?

17:10.571 --> 17:11.613
Sure.

17:11.698 --> 17:12.698
Yes, sir.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.955
Okay, he basically wants us to lie.

17:21.124 --> 17:22.708
That doesn't bother you guys?

17:22.834 --> 17:24.209
Yeah. Nope.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.002
Not especially.

17:26.629 --> 17:29.339
Whatever happened to telling the truth?

17:29.632 --> 17:32.259
The truth shall set you free.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.677
Little hypocritical, don't you think?

17:33.761 --> 17:35.178
Exactly. Thank you.

17:35.263 --> 17:36.763
l mean you.

17:37.014 --> 17:39.891
Don't you have a certain someone to set free
with the truth?

17:39.976 --> 17:42.018
Yes, l do. Crap!

17:45.606 --> 17:48.942
Lenny, you're a great-looking guy.

17:51.362 --> 17:52.612
Good.

17:53.281 --> 17:54.823
Hold on. Do-over.

17:58.077 --> 18:03.165
Lenny, l've never been to Paris by myself.

18:07.462 --> 18:12.132
l can't be with you until l be with me.
Wait, no.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.597
Shit.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.151
-l hope Zales gives refunds.
-l can go with you.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.446
l'll do it alone.

18:35.740 --> 18:38.992
You go to Paris and l'll go to Zales.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.129
Stitches. Took a spill?

18:51.214 --> 18:54.716
No, l was dropped.
And stop manipulating the language.

18:54.801 --> 18:55.884
Okay.

18:56.427 --> 18:59.679
Jackie, you may want to look
at the catheter in three.

19:00.181 --> 19:02.182
-l'll handle it.
-Handle what?

19:02.475 --> 19:07.020
You guys dropped me, that's what.
Why can't anyone say, "l'm sorry"?

19:08.564 --> 19:10.148
Jackie, a word.

19:13.194 --> 19:14.945
There was an incident in trauma.

19:15.029 --> 19:18.490
Hey, hey! What did l say?
Why are we talking about this?

19:18.741 --> 19:20.116
l wasn't here. l'm sorry.

19:20.201 --> 19:24.913
No apologies, not to him, not to me.
Just do yourjobs.

19:29.043 --> 19:32.754
How's it going? That looks better.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.757
What's with you people?

19:37.552 --> 19:39.928
l think we're a little bit off our game.

19:40.012 --> 19:43.890
We dropped you,
and l think it probably scared us.

19:43.975 --> 19:45.559
Well, it scared me more.

19:45.643 --> 19:49.396
Of course it did. We're terribly embarrassed.

19:49.689 --> 19:53.984
On behalf of everyone,
l hope you'll accept our apology.

19:55.987 --> 19:57.320
Thank you.

19:57.738 --> 19:59.990
Let's get him dressed, let's put him in a cab.

20:00.074 --> 20:02.117
Excuse me. Are you Gloria?

20:02.285 --> 20:03.702
And you must be Arden.

20:03.786 --> 20:08.498
Hi, Arden Babbit. l'm Dick's daughter.
Thanks for looking after him.

20:08.583 --> 20:11.042
Ever since the dementia,
it's like babysitting.

20:11.127 --> 20:12.377
What the hell?

20:14.797 --> 20:15.964
Give me a second.

20:17.550 --> 20:22.512
Hey, hey, hey. Dick, stop.
Let's let Mr. Tyler rest?

20:22.597 --> 20:26.224
l don't need rest.
l needed an apology, and l got one.

20:26.309 --> 20:28.977
The thing is he's not actually on staff.
So anything he said...

20:29.061 --> 20:31.021
Dude, he's the only one here
with enough brains

20:31.105 --> 20:34.274
to know that if you drop somebody
on their head, you say, "l'm sorry."

20:34.358 --> 20:36.109
Hey, Daddy.

20:36.777 --> 20:39.195
Arden. Darling.

20:39.655 --> 20:42.574
This is Mr. Tyler. He's a science teacher.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.827
Hi, nice to meet you.
Your dad is a good nurse.

20:46.287 --> 20:47.621
l could have sued you.

20:49.373 --> 20:50.957
That's fair.

20:54.879 --> 20:56.546
Stop buying gifts.

20:57.298 --> 20:58.924
Wrong color? l saved the receipts.

20:59.342 --> 21:00.800
Look, Coop.

21:01.344 --> 21:05.722
l've chosen to do this on my own,
which means exactly that, on my own.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.682
No husband, no wife.

21:07.850 --> 21:09.976
lf l'd wanted a partner, l'd have one.

21:10.478 --> 21:11.978
That's not what l want.

21:12.063 --> 21:13.313
Well, then what is it?

21:13.689 --> 21:15.148
To be part of the village.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.736
Coop, there is no village.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.571
Not now, but just watch.

21:21.656 --> 21:25.450
There'll be night nurses and nannies
and tutors and lots of other people.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.577
Someone calls in sick, pick up the phone.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.245
Someone doesn't show up, l'll be there.

21:29.330 --> 21:31.831
-Coop, l just...
-Also, you might need some alone time.

21:31.916 --> 21:34.876
l mean, seriously, l was raised in Manhattan.
l know all the fun places.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.338
lf l can help, let me help.

21:45.221 --> 21:47.222
l'll keep this one, you take the other one.

21:56.357 --> 21:58.149
That's all for now.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.193
Alone time. Got it.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.956
lt's like you were here yesterday.

22:13.874 --> 22:15.375
-No, l was.
-You were.

22:19.088 --> 22:21.923
You know, Gloria, l'm not a betting man,

22:22.008 --> 22:27.303
but l will put money
on your getting a promotion real soon.

22:30.891 --> 22:32.934
Just keep doing what you do.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.144
Will do.

22:34.228 --> 22:39.274
See you tomorrow.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.163
-Do you got a minute?
-Sure, come on in.

23:05.926 --> 23:08.720
l'm sorry, this is hard for me.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.142
l need to ask a favor.

23:15.186 --> 23:17.062
-How big?
-lt's big.

23:19.774 --> 23:20.940
Shoot.

23:23.736 --> 23:26.029
My divorce lawyer
needs character references.

23:26.822 --> 23:28.198
And you want me to write one.

23:28.282 --> 23:30.200
Look, my husband is trying to take my kids,

23:30.284 --> 23:32.952
and l know l shouldn't ask,
but l also know it's a long shot

23:33.037 --> 23:35.705
'cause custody is usually granted to
the mom, but l...

23:35.790 --> 23:36.998
Couple things,

23:37.792 --> 23:40.668
we don't have a work history, and your file

23:42.421 --> 23:43.630
is empty.

23:43.839 --> 23:46.132
So do l know you? Not really.

23:46.675 --> 23:49.219
And second of all, it's not a long shot.

23:49.303 --> 23:51.805
Okay, l went for sole custody, and l got it.

23:52.431 --> 23:55.100
So here's what we're gonna do.
l'm gonna take a leap of faith.

23:56.143 --> 23:58.353
You're a good nurse. You love your kids.

23:59.021 --> 24:00.647
l'll put it in writing,

24:00.731 --> 24:04.067
put it on some Quantum Bay letterhead.
We'll scare the shit out of them. How's that?

24:07.488 --> 24:09.072
You're a good guy.

24:09.156 --> 24:11.616
l have a couple of ex-wives
who beg to differ.

24:16.664 --> 24:17.705
Shit.

24:17.790 --> 24:18.915
Lawyer?

24:18.999 --> 24:20.333
Nah, it's my kid. l'll call her back.

24:20.417 --> 24:23.837
As your boss and your character witness,
l insist you take that call.

24:32.221 --> 24:34.430
-Hello.
-Please don't hang up.

24:34.807 --> 24:39.602
Listen, honey, l cannot have you in my life.
l am hanging on by a thread.

24:39.687 --> 24:41.855
l get it, l swear. You can hate me.

24:41.939 --> 24:43.439
No, l don't hate you.

24:43.524 --> 24:44.732
lt's okay if you do.

24:44.817 --> 24:49.112
And l promise, you never have to see me
again, but l need a favor.

24:49.196 --> 24:52.031
Come on, haven't you ever needed a favor?

24:55.369 --> 24:57.245
You'd think they'd have a sense of humor.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.247
They're cops, Charlie.

25:00.249 --> 25:03.835
Okay, subway cops are not cops.

25:03.919 --> 25:05.378
l think you just learned that they are.

25:05.462 --> 25:06.963
Be nice. This is my birthday.

25:07.047 --> 25:10.133
Yeah, welcome to 1 8, right?
You get one phone call, and they set bail.

25:10.217 --> 25:12.719
-This shit stopped being cute really fast.
-Okay, hold on. Fuck.

25:13.304 --> 25:14.345
Great.

25:17.683 --> 25:19.559
Fucking thought l was gonna hurl.

25:20.394 --> 25:22.228
You should have called your father.

25:22.897 --> 25:25.607
You're gonna text him right now
and let him know what's going on.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.567
And l want to see a confirmation
when you're done.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.527
Right now.

25:31.322 --> 25:33.615
Charlie, where is your phone?

25:34.450 --> 25:35.575
Here.

25:43.792 --> 25:45.543
For God's sake.

25:47.588 --> 25:53.218
Okay. "l was arrested

25:54.595 --> 25:55.929
"and

25:57.598 --> 26:03.186
"someone from rehab is taking me home.

26:03.729 --> 26:07.273
"l am safe."

26:11.946 --> 26:13.947
You can go home if you want.
