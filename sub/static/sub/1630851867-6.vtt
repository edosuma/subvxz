12:54.974 --> 12:56.175
SAME THING IN MY LIFE WHICH IS

12:56.242 --> 12:56.775
BUY, SELL, AND TRADE TOYS AND

12:56.842 --> 12:59.145
GAMES.

12:59.211 --> 12:59.979
THAT'S BEEN MY SOLACE, THAT'S

13:00.045 --> 13:00.713
BEEN MY CONNECTION TO MY

13:00.779 --> 13:03.983
FRIENDS.

13:04.049 --> 13:06.218
SO, TO ME, TOYS ARE EVERYTHING.

13:06.285 --> 13:07.286
MAINLY BECAUSE I STILL STRUGGLE

13:07.353 --> 13:12.791
WITH EXPRESSING MYSELF.

13:12.858 --> 13:14.527
SOUTH DAKOTA IS A GOOD TWO

13:19.732 --> 13:22.168
OCCURRENCE IN A VERY HATE-FILLED

13:22.234 --> 13:23.302
WAY, AND NOBODY BLINKS AN EYE AT

13:23.369 --> 13:29.141
THAT WORD OUT HERE.

13:38.450 --> 13:40.252
WANT TO HIT ON EVERY BOY, AND
