a book club with her?

to do anything with her.

for a pair of long legs.

15:43.310 --> 15:44.811
Don't go roaming
where you don't belong.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.346
It's just an opinion.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.648
I express
an interest in someone
that I don't even know

is not interesting,
it's pathetic.

She's not big money.

Do you know where she lives?

16:03.530 --> 16:05.932
Yeah, in our sector.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.068
But she runs with the rich
and the beautiful,

16:08.835 --> 16:10.870

make enough of it

30:25.157 --> 30:27.393
Any fool could
get into a college.

30:27.426 --> 30:30.129

the same about Amanda Jones.

CINDY: Mom, what kind of milk
did you say this was?

30:41.707 --> 30:43.809
Sweetheart,
if you don't like the milk,
drink the juice.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.477
It's none of your business.
What, Keith?

30:45.511 --> 30:47.591
Did you see the brochure,
Keith...?
What did you say?

30:49.615 --> 30:52.055
DUNCAN:
It's what my girlfriend
would look like without skin.

30:52.518 --> 30:56.355
Yeah. Nice.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.991

of the double-breasted
party machine,

30:59.025 --> 31:01.160

on your latest coup.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.694
Yeah.

31:02.728 --> 31:05.431
You know about Amanda Jones?
How?

31:05.464 --> 31:08.767
You think I live here?
I have a personal life,
too, man.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.436
How did you manage
to swing that one?

31:10.469 --> 31:11.737
I don't know, Duncan.

31:11.770 --> 31:13.139
You know, I... I asked her out.

31:13.172 --> 31:14.606
She said yes. We're...?

from the outside
lifts a woman

31:19.878 --> 31:22.881

we could all find
cause to rejoice.

31:22.915 --> 31:24.616
I'm proud of you.

31:24.650 --> 31:26.252
Gwat?
A gwat, man.

31:26.285 --> 31:27.653

one time for me, yeah?

or feel you up or anything?

31:33.993 --> 31:35.227
You wanna die young?

31:36.295 --> 31:37.629
What kind of question is that?

31:38.897 --> 31:40.299
Just sit here and shut up.

31:41.100 --> 31:42.634
You don't have a boyfriend,
do you?

31:43.169 --> 31:45.104
No.

31:45.137 --> 31:48.274
See, a lot of guys I know
think that you're...

31:48.307 --> 31:49.408
What?

31:50.109 --> 31:51.944
Confused.
Oh.

31:51.978 --> 31:53.879
See,
but I know it's just an act.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.381
Do you know how I know?

31:55.414 --> 31:56.748
Enlighten me.

31:56.782 --> 31:59.351
'Cause you radiate
this sexual vibe.

31:59.385 --> 32:01.425
And if you wanted to
you could be
a girl like that.

32:03.455 --> 32:06.392
Ray, this is 1987.

32:06.425 --> 32:08.927
Did you know
that a girl can be
whatever she wants to be?

32:09.628 --> 32:10.997
I know. My mom's a plumber.

32:12.231 --> 32:14.366
That explains
a lot about you, Ray.

32:14.400 --> 32:17.003
And I have an enormous amount
of respect for her.

32:18.004 --> 32:19.972
WATTS: Just sit here
and act like you like me.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.109
Okay. That'll be
absolutely no problem.

32:24.676 --> 32:25.978
Hello.

32:26.678 --> 32:28.247
Keith, hi. What's up?

32:28.914 --> 32:30.782
Listen, are... are you busy now?

32:30.816 --> 32:32.184
Oh, no, we were just talking.

32:33.252 --> 32:34.252
Why?

32:35.554 --> 32:37.656
'Cause I'd like
to borrow your car,
if I could.

32:37.689 --> 32:39.925
If you... If you need...
If you have something to do

32:39.958 --> 32:41.793
I could come back around
and pick you up
in about an hour or so.

32:41.827 --> 32:43.795
But can I borrow your car?

32:43.829 --> 32:45.031
Well, where are you going?

32:46.265 --> 32:49.168
I'd like to give Amanda
a ride home.

32:49.201 --> 32:50.569
Hey, by the way,
congratulations, dude.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.338
Man, she's smoking, you know.
All right.

32:53.205 --> 32:54.406
Thanks.

32:55.941 --> 32:57.443
Is that... Is that okay?

32:57.476 --> 32:59.378
I'd appreciate
a couple bucks for gas.

33:02.381 --> 33:05.851
Well, sure.
Guess I'll come back
in about an hour?

33:05.884 --> 33:07.719
It's just time.
Not like it means anything.

33:08.854 --> 33:10.189
Thanks.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.126
So, you gotta wait
around an hour?

33:14.793 --> 33:17.429
(SIGHING)
If I want to.

33:17.463 --> 33:20.266
Do you know how much damage
we could do to
each other in an hour?

33:21.333 --> 33:24.303
It's kind of
a revolting thought, actually.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.905
Really?
What's "revolting" mean?

33:26.938 --> 33:28.540
Oh, my God.

33:28.574 --> 33:31.910
Get your hands off me, man.
Does that mean
you want to come over?

33:31.943 --> 33:33.745
For spring break?
Are you out of your mind?

33:35.081 --> 33:37.149
All right, that's it.
I'm taking you to Aspen.

33:37.183 --> 33:38.817
I won't take you to Aspen.
I'll take you to Chile.

I'm going home with Shayne.

hoping we could talk.

34:02.174 --> 34:03.509
KEITH: Yeah?
Yeah.

34:04.743 --> 34:06.312
Okay.

34:06.345 --> 34:07.746
Oh. Why don't you go with him?

34:11.049 --> 34:13.819
Okay. I'm... I'm sorry.
Uh, where's your car?

34:15.587 --> 34:17.723
(STAMMERING)
Well, I'll pull around.

34:18.924 --> 34:20.192
Okay.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.795
Thanks a lot.
What?

34:23.829 --> 34:25.431
Well, you made me
look really stupid.

34:25.464 --> 34:26.898
I did not make you
look really stupid.

34:26.931 --> 34:29.034
He's giving you
the perfect opportunity
to back out.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.268
He wants to talk.
So, tell him.

34:30.302 --> 34:31.402
Tell him you're back with Hardy.

34:31.437 --> 34:33.038
I'm not back with Hardy.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.306
Okay, then fine.
Tell him the truth.

34:34.340 --> 34:35.541
Tell him that you used him.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.643
I didn't use him.
Oh, really?

34:37.676 --> 34:39.745
You didn't use him
to get away from Hardy?

34:39.777 --> 34:42.313
It wasn't deliberate.
I was mad and he stepped in.

34:42.348 --> 34:44.049
It was just bad circumstances,
okay?

34:44.081 --> 34:45.851
Okay.

34:45.884 --> 34:48.853
Regardless, the longer
you wait to kill it,
the worse it's gonna be.

34:48.887 --> 34:50.322
You saw his face.

34:50.356 --> 34:51.723
I mean, he's completely deluded.

you're really
interested in him.

any reason at this point

Well, I'll... Ahem.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.201
I'll talk to Amanda
about it. But...

41:10.235 --> 41:12.337
I've already talked to her
and she's fine with it.

41:12.370 --> 41:13.639
You talked to her?

41:14.105 --> 41:15.140
Really?

Well, we'll drop by then.

It wouldn't be the weirdest

actually turned out
to be friends.

41:29.454 --> 41:30.889
Yes, it would.

can you do it later? Please.

I can't hide it anymore.

so much time
together anymore.

44:08.914 --> 44:10.115

It's working. It hurts. Okay?

Is that why you have
all your friends
trying to convince me

45:35.733 --> 45:38.369
to go to your house?
So you can prove
what a stud you are

What else can she do?

47:46.264 --> 47:47.698
Not bring him.

She can't take the pressure,
she'll bring him. All right.

Now the party will go down
as expected, okay?

47:52.938 --> 47:56.241
Amanda will blow in
with her guy,

53:03.548 --> 53:05.250
Pick me up anytime you want to.

53:07.252 --> 53:09.920
7:30? If that's a problem,
then... then call me.

53:16.060 --> 53:17.762
Oh, I hate Mexico.

53:17.795 --> 53:20.365
Hi.
I'd much rather go
to the Virgin Islands.

53:20.398 --> 53:22.066
I think we're going to Aspen
over Christmas.

53:22.099 --> 53:23.468
I said, "Hi."

53:23.501 --> 53:25.202
Aspen's okay, but there's really

53:25.236 --> 53:27.905
nothing much to do,
you know, at night.

53:29.440 --> 53:30.841
Yeah,
it's mostly private parties.

last spring.

different feeling.

more college people.
True.

But what's in
the Virgin Islands?

are you kidding me?

and be on my own.

almost talked into

53:53.798 --> 53:56.734
letting me go to Ricky's place
in Santa Fe for Thanksgiving.

53:56.767 --> 53:57.902

it's a little uncomfortable.

one more time

that I go to college.

looking out for you
like he does.

kill you though, right?

in love with her
and she's going out with me.

01:04:22.292 --> 01:04:24.161
Get it?

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:26.475
See,
in the eyes of most people
around here, I'm a nothing.

01:04:28.032 --> 01:04:29.799
And, so I don't
start agreeing with them,

01:04:29.833 --> 01:04:31.368
I'm gonna go through
with this date.

01:04:34.171 --> 01:04:37.274
I just... I wanna show
this girl that
I'm as good as anybody else.

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:40.810
So, what, are you gonna
impress her with money?

01:04:40.844 --> 01:04:43.147
Think that's the solution,
Keith?

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:45.315
Dad, didn't you ever
have guys at your school

01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:46.350
that didn't fit in?

01:04:47.551 --> 01:04:48.885
Yeah, of course.

01:04:49.186 --> 01:04:50.220
Yeah?

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:53.590
Well, I'm one of those guys.

01:04:55.125 --> 01:04:56.994
I thought things
were going okay for you.

01:04:58.595 --> 01:05:00.965
Yeah. Well, I like art.
I work in a gas station.

01:05:00.998 --> 01:05:02.967
My best friend is a tomboy.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.835
These things
don't fly too well
in the American high school.

01:05:05.869 --> 01:05:07.437
I didn't know about this.

01:05:07.471 --> 01:05:09.573
Well,
how could you know about it?
You're my father.

01:05:09.606 --> 01:05:13.010
Jesus, Keith, how could you
blow all that money?

01:05:13.043 --> 01:05:15.012
Believe me,
there's a good reason
behind all this.

01:05:15.045 --> 01:05:17.381
You just got to trust me.

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:19.883
Trust you?
There's a limit, Keith.

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:21.651
How can you put
a limit on trust?

01:05:24.021 --> 01:05:26.923
Do you know any father
who would let his kid
do something like this?

01:05:27.557 --> 01:05:29.026
No.

01:05:29.059 --> 01:05:30.699
So why should I
have to go along with it?

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:34.131
Because you believe in me.

01:05:42.172 --> 01:05:44.141
Listen,
I'm gonna replace the money.

01:05:45.475 --> 01:05:47.811
Think about it,
you know I will.
I'm not stupid.

01:05:47.844 --> 01:05:50.580
I didn't work all this time
just to throw everything away

01:05:50.614 --> 01:05:51.681
without thinking about it.

01:05:53.017 --> 01:05:54.384
I know what I'm doing.

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:57.021
You sure?

01:05:57.921 --> 01:05:59.123
Yeah.

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:02.959
Okay.

01:06:07.931 --> 01:06:09.933
But I'm still gonna
ride your ass
about college, Keith,

01:06:09.966 --> 01:06:11.668
I'm not giving up on that.

01:06:11.701 --> 01:06:12.736
All right.

01:06:14.504 --> 01:06:16.140
I've said my piece.

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:24.948
Do me a favor, will you?

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:26.516
Sure.

01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:27.717
Stop calling me Clifford.

01:06:29.753 --> 01:06:31.055

Stop sneaking around
listening at people's doors.

01:06:38.662 --> 01:06:40.897
Me?
Yeah, you.

01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:43.333
Dad, I just came up
to tell Keith

01:06:43.367 --> 01:06:45.007
that Watts is downstairs
waiting for him.

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:47.604
Well, don't get in his way.

01:06:50.107 --> 01:06:51.841
Did he go apeshit?
No.

01:06:51.875 --> 01:06:53.210
Really?

01:06:53.243 --> 01:06:54.678
Laura, I'm really
in kind of hurry now.

01:06:54.711 --> 01:06:57.681
Keith, I just came up
to wish you luck tonight.

01:06:57.714 --> 01:07:00.350
Okay, I have all my friends
crossing their fingers
for you.

01:07:01.718 --> 01:07:03.019
Thank you.

01:07:04.954 --> 01:07:06.356
He really didn't go apeshit?

01:07:08.258 --> 01:07:09.559
He's probably saving it for me.

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:12.396
You want me to lock up for you?

01:07:12.429 --> 01:07:14.030
Please. Thanks.

01:07:41.458 --> 01:07:42.792
Give me a break.

01:07:42.826 --> 01:07:44.428
Would you look at us.

01:07:44.461 --> 01:07:46.130
I think you look tremendous.

01:07:46.163 --> 01:07:48.132
It's too bad my grandmother
bit the dust.

01:07:48.165 --> 01:07:49.725
She'd be very proud.
I'm wearing a bra.

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:53.537

Let's go.
All right.

Wow! Check that out.
Did you steal it?

No. I borrowed it.

bring an extra girl

Well, I like to cover my bets.

That's very cute.

I'll have to remember that.

I'm gonna love this one.

It's beluga caviar.

It's the most expensive
caviar you can buy.

you were an uptown girl.

Dad, please, freeze it.

01:14:52.121 --> 01:14:54.090
Okay? I told you before,
it's gonna be all fine.

01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:59.028
God, those are nice legs, man.

01:14:59.062 --> 01:15:01.765
If I lose my job
because of this
you're in the dumper, Duncan.

01:15:01.798 --> 01:15:03.933

I can come here
and what anybody says
about me doesn't matter.

I have to come back here
when I can spend more time.

We have all night.

01:16:00.289 --> 01:16:02.225
There's one in here
that I'd like to show you.

AMANDA:
So what do you see in me?

01:17:17.366 --> 01:17:18.968
Be honest.

You first.

01:17:23.372 --> 01:17:25.441
I don't think anybody
ever thought
anything about me

01:17:25.474 --> 01:17:27.210
other than I look good
next to him.

01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:29.979
And I went along with it

01:17:31.414 --> 01:17:33.814
because I'd rather be
next to somebody
for the wrong reasons

01:17:34.417 --> 01:17:35.952
than alone for the right ones.

01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:38.822
I'd rather be right.

there's someone
out there for you

I don't know.

but I will.

What are you talking about?

01:18:06.415 --> 01:18:08.217
You know what I'm talking about.

No, I don't.

Yes, you do.
It's not funny.

I was set up.

You used me, right?

Didn't you?

I don't know. In a way.
In a way?

01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:34.543
Amanda, there's only one way
you use someone.

01:18:34.577 --> 01:18:36.813
You either do or you don't.

01:18:36.846 --> 01:18:38.047
And you didn't use me?

01:18:39.615 --> 01:18:41.184
God, you hypocrite.

in that museum, huh?

My soul? No, it's my face.

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:51.094
You're using me
to pay back every guy

and more power than you.

You're right.

01:19:09.612 --> 01:19:11.014
I did use you.

01:19:12.015 --> 01:19:13.850
For all those reasons.

01:19:15.251 --> 01:19:16.352
I'm sorry.

01:19:20.824 --> 01:19:22.391
Can we call it even?

01:19:26.796 --> 01:19:28.097
We're even.

This is for you.

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:44.047

It's my future.

You have to.

I know you liked them.
I saw you wearing Shayne's,
remember?

01:20:20.516 --> 01:20:23.286
This is insane.
It doesn't make any sense.

01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:25.254
You shouldn't have
to borrow anything.

01:20:26.222 --> 01:20:27.891
You're too good for that.

Why are you crying?

I feel so terrible
for what I've been doing.

I hate, I hate feeling ashamed.

01:20:47.076 --> 01:20:48.945
I hate where I'm from.

01:20:53.116 --> 01:20:55.851
I hate watching my friends
get everything
their hearts desire.

(SIGHING)

01:21:02.892 --> 01:21:05.328

and I turned on
what I believed in.

I didn't have to.

01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:12.501
You didn't.

the crap out of you.

It's for real, Keith.
I know.

Well, if you wanna do that,
drive yourself.

sooner or later.

It's his friends.

I could beat
the crap out of you.

01:28:08.784 --> 01:28:11.420
looking at you like
I don't know what.

01:28:11.454 --> 01:28:12.955
All right,
now we're ready to party.

01:28:12.988 --> 01:28:15.858
What a beautiful woman
right here.
She is dying for you.

01:28:17.192 --> 01:28:19.294
(LAUGHING)

01:28:19.328 --> 01:28:20.929
Remind me never to
get you mad at me.

01:28:22.631 --> 01:28:24.767
Did you see
the look on his face?

01:28:26.402 --> 01:28:28.604
* SO LONELY *

01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:59.001
Nice move.
I saw it from out here.

01:29:00.235 --> 01:29:02.671
Well, uh,

01:29:02.705 --> 01:29:04.640
why don't you guys run along?
I'm gonna walk.

01:29:04.673 --> 01:29:06.542
My butt's asleep
from sitting all night.

01:29:11.414 --> 01:29:13.449
I'm sorry if I misjudged you.

01:29:15.418 --> 01:29:16.752
That's okay.

01:29:22.357 --> 01:29:23.592
Keys are in the car.

01:29:29.432 --> 01:29:32.868
Remember how I said
I'd rather be with someone
for the wrong reasons

01:29:32.901 --> 01:29:34.937
than alone for the right ones?

01:29:37.606 --> 01:29:38.974
I'd rather be right.

01:29:44.279 --> 01:29:45.879
It's gonna feel good
to stand on my own.

01:29:48.684 --> 01:29:49.852
Here.

01:29:57.693 --> 01:29:59.853
In your heart
you wanted to give these
to somebody else.

01:30:02.765 --> 01:30:03.799
Go.

01:30:05.701 --> 01:30:06.735
Go on.

01:30:19.314 --> 01:30:20.516
Watts!

01:30:29.858 --> 01:30:30.926
Watts!

01:30:32.194 --> 01:30:33.462
Watts.

01:30:37.399 --> 01:30:38.634
Watts.

01:31:04.326 --> 01:31:06.829
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

01:31:08.096 --> 01:31:10.065
Yeah, well, you're stupid.

01:31:10.098 --> 01:31:11.667
I always knew you were stupid.

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:14.202
Why didn't you tell me?

01:31:15.237 --> 01:31:16.672
You never asked.

01:31:19.374 --> 01:31:20.576
(CHUCKLES)

01:31:23.546 --> 01:31:24.913
I wanted these.

01:31:25.614 --> 01:31:26.915
I really wanted them.

01:31:28.116 --> 01:31:29.552
They're yours.

01:31:31.587 --> 01:31:33.055
You knew
you were gonna get these.

01:31:33.088 --> 01:31:34.623
No, I didn't.

01:31:34.657 --> 01:31:37.092
I hoped, but I didn't know.

01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:39.127
You knew.

01:31:40.529 --> 01:31:41.964
I had a feeling.

01:31:44.667 --> 01:31:46.569
Well, how do they look?

01:31:49.071 --> 01:31:52.107
You look good wearing my future.

01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:55.077
*(LICK THE TINS PLAYING
CAN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE)

01:32:05.554 --> 01:32:07.590
* Wise men say

01:32:08.290 --> 01:32:10.926
* Only fools rush in

01:32:12.127 --> 01:32:14.863
* But I can't help

01:32:14.897 --> 01:32:17.933
* Falling in love with you

01:32:19.602 --> 01:32:22.370
* Shall I stay

01:32:22.404 --> 01:32:25.808
* Would it be a sin

01:32:25.841 --> 01:32:28.911
* If I can't help

01:32:28.944 --> 01:32:31.546
* Falling in love with you

01:32:33.816 --> 01:32:36.318
* Like a river flows

01:32:37.485 --> 01:32:39.755
* Surely to the sea

01:32:41.156 --> 01:32:44.192
* Darling so it goes

01:32:44.226 --> 01:32:46.762
* Some things were meant to be *

01:32:48.096 --> 01:32:50.733
* Take my hand

01:32:50.766 --> 01:32:53.636
* Take my whole life too

01:32:54.269 --> 01:32:57.472
* 'Cause I can't help

01:32:57.505 --> 01:33:00.909
* Falling in love with you

01:33:16.391 --> 01:33:19.161
* Wise men say

01:33:19.194 --> 01:33:22.564
* Only fools rush in

01:33:22.597 --> 01:33:25.701
* But I can't help

01:33:25.734 --> 01:33:28.737
* Falling in love with you

01:33:30.505 --> 01:33:33.308
* Shall I stay

01:33:33.341 --> 01:33:36.712
* Would it be a sin

01:33:36.745 --> 01:33:39.782
* If I can't help

01:33:39.815 --> 01:33:42.951
* Falling in love with you

01:33:43.786 --> 01:33:46.922
