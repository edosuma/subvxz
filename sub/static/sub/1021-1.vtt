WEBVTT

04:46.328 --> 04:47.660
Ow.

07:11.014 --> 07:17.511
Should pale death with treble dread
make the ocean caves our bed,

07:17.520 --> 07:22.732
God who hear'st the surges roll,
deign to save our suppliant soul.

07:22.734 --> 07:23.895
To four weeks.

07:25.904 --> 07:27.020
No, sir. Thank you.

07:27.030 --> 07:30.489
It's bad luck to leave
a toast unfinished, lad.

07:31.326 --> 07:33.363
Oh, meanin'... meanin' no disrespect.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.745
Man what don't drink
best have his reasons.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.245
Uh... Ain't it... I...

07:42.170 --> 07:45.538
I... I understood
it's against regulations, sir...

07:45.548 --> 07:46.629
Did you?

07:47.217 --> 07:49.925
I did, sir. From, uh...
From them's manual.

07:49.928 --> 07:52.295
Didn't picture you a readin' man.

07:54.224 --> 07:57.183
Well, I ain't trying for trouble.

07:57.185 --> 07:58.676
Then you'll do as I say.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.103
That's in your book too.

08:36.390 --> 08:37.847
To four weeks.

08:48.903 --> 08:52.613
Aye. Aye. The cistern needs a-lookin' to.

08:52.615 --> 08:57.326
One of your duties, lad.
Or didn't y'read yourself about it?

08:57.412 --> 09:01.952
You'll clean the brass and the clockwork,
and you'll tidy up the quarters after.

09:02.751 --> 09:05.789
And there's well more
to be mended outside.

09:05.795 --> 09:06.911
D'you hear me, lad?

09:08.089 --> 09:09.455
Yes, sir.

09:09.466 --> 09:10.502
Aye, sir!

09:12.260 --> 09:14.001
Aye, sir.

09:21.436 --> 09:24.679
When the fog clears,
you'll work through the dog watch.

09:27.484 --> 09:28.645
Doggin' it?

09:29.778 --> 09:31.815
I was 'specting I'd get up
to see the lantern.

09:31.821 --> 09:32.902
I tend the light.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.240
Well, the rules is alternatin' shifts.

09:37.327 --> 09:42.322
It's the mid-watch that's to dread, lad.
My watch, night to morning.

09:43.875 --> 09:46.834
Some new junior man I'm fixed with.

09:47.879 --> 09:51.338
See to your duties. The light is mine.

10:21.663 --> 10:23.074
Son of a bitch!

13:50.079 --> 13:51.160
Shingles.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.327
Tend to 'em after the cistern.

13:59.380 --> 14:02.339
And the lamp, she needs oil.

14:06.721 --> 14:07.837
Aye, sir.

16:58.768 --> 16:59.929
Go!

17:02.813 --> 17:04.054
Move it.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.044
You don't go in there!

19:02.308 --> 19:05.392
- Oil, sir.
- Tired? Use this next time.

19:06.854 --> 19:08.937
Save you a hell of a lot of trouble.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.226
Catch your breath, lad.

19:14.987 --> 19:18.276
I said, catch your breath, lad.

19:19.950 --> 19:24.411
Then bring that drum back down
the ladder well where y'found it.

19:25.956 --> 19:29.370
'Less you're fixin'
to burn the whole light down.

19:34.757 --> 19:38.376
Then see to the rest of your duties.
You're behindhand already.

19:40.096 --> 19:43.214
- Aye, sir.
- You're too slow. You a dullard?

19:44.725 --> 19:45.309
No, sir.

19:45.310 --> 19:46.470
Fooled me.

19:58.572 --> 20:04.193
Should pale death with treble dread
make the ocean caves our bed,

20:04.203 --> 20:09.323
God who hear'st the surges roll,
deign to save the suppliant soul.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.210
Still tastes o'the head?

20:23.848 --> 20:28.764
Ah, find some chirk in ye, lad.
Now is the time for gab and chatter.

20:29.270 --> 20:30.932
Y'best be enjoying it.

20:30.938 --> 20:33.681
Come a fortnight,
and the brace of us'll be wantin'

20:33.691 --> 20:36.354
to be ever silent as the tomb.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.602
I ain't much for talkin'.

20:39.572 --> 20:40.904
Reckon you're the first?

20:41.741 --> 20:42.741
No, sir. I don't.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.159
Y'ain't.

20:44.201 --> 20:45.533
Y'ain't.

20:49.165 --> 20:53.159
The <i>Chicopee,</i> a fine-un she were.

20:54.003 --> 20:56.461
Clean-built and trig-lookin'.

20:57.423 --> 21:00.416
None more fleet in '64 than she.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.255
We were on the breaks.

21:03.804 --> 21:05.340
A mutiny, it were.

21:06.182 --> 21:07.889
And why, ask ye? Why?

21:08.601 --> 21:13.517
What's the terrible part
of a sailor's life, ask ye, lad?

21:14.732 --> 21:17.645
'Tis when the work stops
when you're twixt wind and water.

21:17.735 --> 21:22.400
Doldrums. Doldrums. Eviler than the Devil.

21:22.406 --> 21:27.367
Boredom makes men to villains,
and the water goes quick, lad, vanished.

21:29.246 --> 21:33.206
The only med'cine is drink.

21:33.626 --> 21:36.289
Keeps them sailors happy,
keeps 'em agreeable,

21:36.295 --> 21:37.957
keeps 'em calm, keeps 'em...

21:38.047 --> 21:39.128
Stupid.

21:46.013 --> 21:50.678
Curse me if there ain't an old tar spirit
somewheres in ye, lad.

22:00.361 --> 22:01.897
Out with it, lad.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.237
Uh...

22:05.449 --> 22:09.113
What, uh...
What made your last keeper leave?

22:09.203 --> 22:10.739
Him? Me second?

22:11.831 --> 22:12.947
Mm-hmm.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.497
Died.

22:16.460 --> 22:17.826
Went mad, he did.

22:18.671 --> 22:23.132
Ravin' about sirens, merfolk,
bad omens and the like.

22:23.425 --> 22:28.887
In the end, weren't no more sense left
in him than an hen's tooth.

22:29.431 --> 22:34.017
He believed that there was
some enchantment in the light.

22:34.520 --> 22:40.187
He notioned that St. Elmo
had cast his very fire into it.

22:43.279 --> 22:46.192
Salvation, said he.

22:56.834 --> 22:57.995
Tall tales.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.465
I seen ye sparrin' with a gull.

23:07.511 --> 23:08.672
Best leave 'em be.

23:09.847 --> 23:12.134
Bad luck to kill a seabird.

23:13.475 --> 23:14.966
More tall tales.

23:17.563 --> 23:19.054
Bad luck to kill a seabird!

23:29.241 --> 23:30.777
Pay me no mind, lad.

23:31.493 --> 23:32.529
None.

23:33.829 --> 23:36.037
Fix us up some coffee.

23:38.375 --> 23:39.741
Long night ahead.

23:41.253 --> 23:44.041
Drop o'coffee will do us good.

25:48.297 --> 25:50.630
You've been neglecting your duties, lad!

25:53.218 --> 25:54.675
Don't deny it!

25:55.471 --> 25:56.678
What do you call that?

25:58.599 --> 26:00.431
- Sir?
- What?

26:01.518 --> 26:03.805
I... I mopped and swept twice over, sir.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.103
Ye lyin' dog.

26:08.025 --> 26:10.438
- I swept 'em.
- 'Tis begrimed and bedabbled.

26:11.195 --> 26:13.107
Unwiped, unwashed, and distained.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.606
You get some kinda peart
outta molestin' me?

26:16.700 --> 26:17.941
Come now?

26:20.329 --> 26:21.410
I already says...

26:21.413 --> 26:23.325
How dare ye contradict me, y'dog.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.499
Now look here,
I ain't never intended to be no housewife

26:26.502 --> 26:28.368
nor slave in takin' this job.

26:28.629 --> 26:29.790
It ain't right.

26:30.756 --> 26:35.467
These lodgings is more ramshackle
than any shanty boy's camp I ever seen.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.760
The Queen of England's
own fancy housekeeper

26:37.763 --> 26:39.345
couldn't even done no better
than what I done,

26:39.348 --> 26:42.466
'cause I tell you, I scrubbed
this here place twice over, sir...

26:42.476 --> 26:44.513
And I say y'did nothin' o'the sort.

26:45.145 --> 26:49.264
And I say y'swab it again,
and y'swab it proper-like this time,

26:49.274 --> 26:52.858
and you'll be swabbin' it
ten times more after that.

26:53.695 --> 26:56.062
And if I tells ye to pull up and apart

26:56.073 --> 26:58.816
every floorboard and clapboard
of this here house

26:58.867 --> 27:02.110
and scour 'em down with your bare,
bleedin' knuckles, you'll do it!

27:02.830 --> 27:06.073
And if I tells ye to yank out
every single nail

27:06.083 --> 27:10.999
from every molderin' nail-hole
and suck off every speck of rust

27:11.046 --> 27:15.507
till all them nails sparkle
like a sperm whale's pecker,

27:15.509 --> 27:20.049
and then carpenter the whole light station
back together from scrap,

27:20.055 --> 27:22.923
and then do it all over again,
you'll do it!

27:22.933 --> 27:24.765
And by God and by golly,

27:24.810 --> 27:27.097
you'll do it smilin', lad,
'cause you'll like it.

27:27.104 --> 27:29.471
You'll like it 'cause I says you will!

27:32.484 --> 27:36.979
Contradict me again,
and I'll dock your wages.

27:39.449 --> 27:40.656
D'ye hear me, lad?

27:43.036 --> 27:44.152
Aye, sir.

27:45.247 --> 27:46.454
Ah.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.783
Swab, dog. Swab!

29:08.247 --> 29:10.284
Keep 'em steady, lad!

29:10.916 --> 29:12.623
Aye, sir.

29:12.876 --> 29:16.870
Whitewash must be even, lad.
Bright! Shinin'!

29:16.880 --> 29:21.841
Like a silver whorehouse token.
Give them sailors a proper daymark.

29:21.843 --> 29:24.426
They're not going to see it
in a goddamn storm!

29:25.013 --> 29:26.970
Keep your temper now, lad.

29:27.599 --> 29:31.559
'Tis fine work. And you're makin'
high marks in me logbook.

29:31.561 --> 29:32.847
Them's gospel.

29:34.564 --> 29:36.476
I'll drop y'down a few feet.

29:38.694 --> 29:39.775
Easy!

29:40.320 --> 29:42.357
Never been in better hands.

29:45.158 --> 29:46.365
Easy!

29:46.368 --> 29:48.325
Quit your flailing, lad.

29:48.412 --> 29:50.028
- I ain't!
- Y'are!

29:50.038 --> 29:51.779
- Keep still!
- I am!

30:23.405 --> 30:26.694
Git! Git! Git! Git!

31:02.819 --> 31:04.026
Thank ye, lad.

31:05.489 --> 31:06.775
Winslow.

31:08.533 --> 31:09.899
Ephraim Winslow.

31:11.328 --> 31:12.910
These last two weeks, I'd...

31:13.538 --> 31:15.621
I'd like it if you'd call me by my name.

31:15.624 --> 31:17.741
Listen to ye,

31:18.835 --> 31:20.667
giving orders, lad.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.421
- Winslow.
- All right, all right.

31:24.091 --> 31:27.334
Suits me just as fine, Ephraim Winslow.

31:27.719 --> 31:33.431
So, what brung such a one as ye
to this damned rock?

31:34.434 --> 31:35.641
Such as what?

31:36.186 --> 31:37.768
Pretty as a picture.

31:38.855 --> 31:41.814
Only joshing, lad, only josh...

31:41.817 --> 31:43.524
- Winslow.
- Winslow.

31:45.821 --> 31:47.187
What brung ye...

31:50.200 --> 31:53.534
...to this rock, Ephraim Winslow?

31:56.415 --> 31:57.906
What were your work afore?

31:59.751 --> 32:01.333
- Timber.
- Timber?

32:02.504 --> 32:06.088
Big timber. Up north. Canada ways.

32:06.091 --> 32:08.674
- Hudson Bay outfit?
- The same.

32:08.677 --> 32:12.717
True what they say?
"Forest as far as the eye can see"?

32:13.306 --> 32:16.174
Yes, sir. Spruce, tamarack, white pine.

32:17.352 --> 32:19.309
"Bush," them folk up there call it.

32:19.312 --> 32:21.395
Had enough of trees, that it, then?

32:21.731 --> 32:22.847
Yes, sir.

32:22.858 --> 32:24.975
Can't say I blame ye.

32:25.610 --> 32:29.274
I hearn tell about that life. Hard goin'.

32:29.656 --> 32:33.149
Work one man harder
than two horses, they say.

32:33.493 --> 32:35.359
No, thankee.

32:37.956 --> 32:42.576
The sea, she's the only situation
wantin' for me.

32:45.505 --> 32:46.505
Miss it?

32:46.756 --> 32:50.466
Ain't nothing what can touch it.

32:51.845 --> 32:53.086
But I can't...

32:53.096 --> 32:55.509
...be draggin' me old stump about.

32:56.683 --> 32:58.595
Nay. Not worth the trouble.

32:59.728 --> 33:03.438
Now I'm a wickie and a wickie I is.

33:03.940 --> 33:07.308
And I'm damn-well wedded
to this here light,

33:07.986 --> 33:12.151
and she's been a finer,
truer, quieter wife

33:12.157 --> 33:14.069
than any alive-blooded woman.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.281
You ever married?

33:19.956 --> 33:21.492
Thirteen Christmases at sea...

33:23.502 --> 33:24.868
little 'uns at home.

33:26.505 --> 33:27.871
She never forgave it.

33:31.051 --> 33:32.417
'Tis for the better.

33:33.803 --> 33:38.423
Since we're getting too friendly,
Ephraim Winslow,

33:38.475 --> 33:43.391
tell me, what's a timber man
want with being a wickie?

33:48.151 --> 33:50.894
Not enough quiet for ye up north?

33:51.571 --> 33:53.608
Sawdust itching your nethers?

33:53.615 --> 33:57.609
Foreman found ye too high-tempered
for carrying an ax?

34:00.163 --> 34:03.247
Like you said,
I just had enough of trees, I guess.

34:08.922 --> 34:10.333
Since I left Dad,

34:11.757 --> 34:13.920
I done every kind of work
that can pay a man.

34:14.844 --> 34:16.130
Some I ain't near proud of.

34:16.804 --> 34:18.137
Drifter, eh?

34:18.223 --> 34:19.429
No, just...

34:20.016 --> 34:23.259
Can't find a post
I can take a real shine to,

34:23.270 --> 34:24.806
so I keep movin' along.

34:25.272 --> 34:27.480
And I ain't the kind to look back
at what's behind him, see.

34:27.482 --> 34:28.598
On the run?

34:28.692 --> 34:33.062
Now look here, ain't nothin' wrong
with a man startin' fresh, startin' new,

34:33.071 --> 34:34.277
just lookin' to earn a living.

34:34.281 --> 34:35.897
No.

34:36.824 --> 34:38.157
Just like any man,

34:38.159 --> 34:40.947
just wanna settle down
quiet-like with some earnings.

34:42.871 --> 34:46.456
I read someplace
that a man could earn 630 or...

34:47.252 --> 34:48.958
I read $1,000 a year

34:49.713 --> 34:51.545
if he tends a light far off shore.

34:52.257 --> 34:54.089
The further away, the more he earns.

34:55.385 --> 34:59.129
I read that, and hell, I says, work.

34:59.639 --> 35:00.925
Save my earnings.

35:05.729 --> 35:08.187
Sometime soon I'll raise my own roof,

35:08.189 --> 35:11.648
somewheres up country,
with no one to tell me what for.

35:13.320 --> 35:14.356
And that's all.

35:19.409 --> 35:21.742
Same old borin' story, eh?

35:24.164 --> 35:25.325
Well, you asked.

35:33.173 --> 35:36.416
Say, why is it bad luck to kill a gull?

35:37.302 --> 35:41.342
In 'em's the souls of sailors
what met their maker.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.100
You a prayin' man, Winslow?

35:48.563 --> 35:50.350
Not as often as I might.

35:51.483 --> 35:53.941
But I'm God-fearin',
if that's what you're askin'.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.551
Shit.

41:32.699 --> 41:34.031
Wind's changed.

41:34.784 --> 41:36.150
Oh. Good riddance.

41:36.160 --> 41:39.995
Oh, don't be so darn foolish.
It's the calm afore the storm, Winslow.

41:40.748 --> 41:43.991
She were a gentle westerly wind
you're cursin'.

41:45.003 --> 41:47.871
Only feels roughly 'cause you don't know
nothin' about nothin',

41:47.880 --> 41:51.999
and there ain't no trees on this here rock
like your Hudson Bay bush.

41:52.927 --> 41:55.294
Nor'Easterly wind'll come soon

41:55.304 --> 41:57.170
a-blowin' like Gabriel's horn.

41:57.682 --> 42:00.174
Best board up them signal house winders.

42:01.019 --> 42:02.635
- Aye, sir.
- 'Twill keep steady

42:02.687 --> 42:05.304
afore the tender comes in the morn,
I 'spect,

42:06.149 --> 42:08.732
but there's dirty weather knockin' about.

42:12.989 --> 42:14.446
Somethin' stirring in ye?

42:15.992 --> 42:18.985
You're gettin' off this rock tomorry,
Winslow.

42:19.620 --> 42:21.202
Don't start grudgen me now.

42:22.707 --> 42:24.039
No, sir.

42:24.042 --> 42:25.453
Keeping secrets, are ye?

42:29.005 --> 42:31.292
I could just use a hand
with them boards, is all.

42:42.977 --> 42:44.639
Pull, Winslow!

42:49.067 --> 42:50.399
Look at 'em.

42:51.652 --> 42:53.268
Better than fin fishin'.

42:59.952 --> 43:06.244
Ain't no crime to take a snort now.
A clear night, and our last afore relief.

43:07.085 --> 43:11.375
I ain't never known an inspector
what wouldn't turn a blind eye.

43:12.215 --> 43:15.424
And I won't take no for an answer.

43:23.684 --> 43:27.303
Should pale death and treble dread...

43:29.273 --> 43:32.016
Ah, hell. To... to relief.

43:32.401 --> 43:34.017
And how.

43:37.657 --> 43:39.364
Oh!

43:56.425 --> 43:58.917
<i>♪ Hurrah, we're homeward bound ♪</i>

43:58.928 --> 44:01.136
<i>♪ Hurrah, we're homeward bound! ♪</i>

44:01.139 --> 44:03.426
<i>♪ When we're arrived at Bedford docks ♪</i>

44:03.432 --> 44:05.594
<i>♪ Them bloomers comin' out in flocks ♪</i>

44:05.643 --> 44:08.101
<i>♪ Them pretty girls
They all did say ♪</i>

44:08.104 --> 44:10.266

44:10.273 --> 44:12.356
<i>♪ Hurrah, we're homeward bound ♪</i>

44:12.358 --> 44:14.475
<i>♪ Hurrah, we're homeward bound! ♪</i>

44:14.986 --> 44:18.354
...and a pretty lass, she were,
takin' off her bonnet,

44:18.364 --> 44:23.075
but as I says, I'd broke me leg,
and banged meself all up.

44:23.327 --> 44:26.070
It was to a nuns' hospital.

44:26.706 --> 44:29.540
All of them nuns
were Catholics, I tell ye.

44:35.298 --> 44:40.760
But I never went to Salem since
without hoping that I should see her,

44:42.096 --> 44:45.760
for beddin' down weren't the same since.

44:49.645 --> 44:51.728
You feel shame when you lie with a woman?

44:51.731 --> 44:53.393
I ain't 'shamed of nothing!

44:57.945 --> 44:59.686
Well, I'll say it...

45:00.489 --> 45:03.857
I might even miss ye, Ephraim Winslow.

45:03.910 --> 45:08.154
You're fastly a true blue wickie

45:08.164 --> 45:10.030
in the making, you is.

45:10.082 --> 45:13.200
Thought one night you was bound to
split me skull in twain,

45:13.211 --> 45:14.827
but you're a good-un.

45:15.546 --> 45:18.755
Why, you'll be workin' the lamp
in no time.

45:19.759 --> 45:20.920
Why haven't I?

45:22.386 --> 45:23.467
What?

45:24.305 --> 45:25.637
The light.

45:32.355 --> 45:34.563
I'm the keeper of this station, lad.

45:34.607 --> 45:36.724
Some other station, y'can tend the light.

45:36.734 --> 45:37.815
The manual says...

45:37.818 --> 45:40.902
- My log is the only book on this rock...
- Since I'm wickie...

45:41.280 --> 45:44.489
I'm the keeper of the light, lad.
I never let no man touch her...

45:44.492 --> 45:47.485
Don't concern yourself
with the beacon, lad!

45:47.495 --> 45:48.576
Mine!

46:00.132 --> 46:02.374
Have it your way.

46:13.562 --> 46:14.769
Say, I never...

46:16.357 --> 46:18.269
I don't... I don't know your name.

46:19.443 --> 46:20.559
Wake.

46:21.570 --> 46:23.106
Your Christian name.

46:25.324 --> 46:26.440
Thomas.

46:29.036 --> 46:31.323
- Thomas?
- Aye, Thomas Wake.

46:33.874 --> 46:35.035
Call me Tom.

46:43.217 --> 46:44.503
Well...

46:47.263 --> 46:48.845
To my friend Tom.

46:51.225 --> 46:53.217
And gettin' off this goddamn rock.

50:42.665 --> 50:44.406
What are y'splittin' your lungs fer?

50:44.416 --> 50:46.203
You smell o' shit.

50:46.252 --> 50:48.744
Best swab this mess
afore the tender comes.

50:51.006 --> 50:53.999
Do as you're told, lad.
The quarters are dire.

50:54.760 --> 50:57.594
Aye... Aye, sir. Aye.

51:44.518 --> 51:45.884
They didn't come.

52:27.394 --> 52:29.681
The damp's got to the provisions!

52:33.192 --> 52:34.228
What?

52:34.610 --> 52:37.728
The damp's got to the provisions!

52:56.799 --> 53:00.338
The damp's got to the foodstuffs.
The salt cod is out.

53:01.011 --> 53:04.300
- Out?
- Blasted. Gone to rot.

53:05.307 --> 53:07.720
- Praised be.
- Will you hear me now?

53:08.310 --> 53:10.768
- Hear what?
- That we best be rationing.

53:11.897 --> 53:14.514
- Rationing?
- Insubordinate again?

53:15.359 --> 53:16.975
It's only been one day.

53:16.985 --> 53:18.192
Devil's tail.

53:19.988 --> 53:23.572
Look, maybe the tender did come.
We just missed her, is all.

53:24.410 --> 53:25.742
I can take the dory out.

53:27.121 --> 53:28.737
Weeks, Winslow. Weeks.

53:29.540 --> 53:30.701
What?

53:31.250 --> 53:32.661
What do you mean, what?

53:32.668 --> 53:34.580
- Weeks?
- Weeks. Aye, weeks.

53:36.004 --> 53:37.586
We slept in. Dead drunk.

53:37.589 --> 53:40.673
It's been weeks ago
since we missed her, Winslow.

53:41.301 --> 53:44.544
And I've been askin' ye
to ration for weeks now, too,

53:44.555 --> 53:47.423
but you've kept barking at me
like a mad dog

53:47.433 --> 53:50.426
sayin' you can take the dory out.

53:50.436 --> 53:53.429
- Now, look here...
- Oh, no. Don't be losing your head now.

53:54.064 --> 53:55.726
- This ain't funny.
- No, it ain't.

53:56.316 --> 54:00.026
And I ain't want to be stranded here
with some damn lunatic.

54:02.448 --> 54:04.155
Stranded?

54:04.575 --> 54:06.535
That's what I said.

54:07.202 --> 54:09.694
Why, I thought... I thought you said
relief was coming.

54:09.913 --> 54:12.530
If we can wait out the storm.

54:14.126 --> 54:16.288
The tender is coming.

54:17.671 --> 54:23.258
In '75, <i>Ol' Striker</i> were marooned here
for seven long months, he was.

54:23.886 --> 54:27.926
The storm died on the mainland,
but here, the waters were too rageful

54:27.931 --> 54:29.422
neither to launch nor land.

54:32.561 --> 54:34.268
You're just tryin' to scare me.

54:34.354 --> 54:36.971
Look at ye. Pretendin'.

54:40.319 --> 54:42.982
But ye well know your lot.

55:08.472 --> 55:09.633
Dig!

55:12.518 --> 55:13.804
Dig, says I!

55:14.812 --> 55:15.893
Dig!

55:16.730 --> 55:18.266
Dig!

55:22.528 --> 55:24.736
There she lies.

55:45.843 --> 55:47.084
Rations.

55:48.303 --> 55:51.887
The worst of us
couldn't fend 'gainst the ship rats

55:51.890 --> 55:55.224
what gnawed on the soles of our feet.

55:59.815 --> 56:03.604
Their legs withered
and turned gangree'nous,

56:03.610 --> 56:06.728
every shade of the peacock's tail.

56:07.406 --> 56:12.401
Their gums grew swollen,
the color of bone, then to rot.

56:13.036 --> 56:15.904
Tarry blood oozed,

56:15.914 --> 56:20.500
teeth droppin' to the deck
with none to hold on to.

56:23.380 --> 56:27.294
"Land ho!" hears I,

56:27.759 --> 56:33.005
but only grass on that island.
So we et upon the grass.

56:33.098 --> 56:38.389
And 'twas that scurvy
what left me locked ever since.

56:40.522 --> 56:42.809
I thought you said you'd broke it.

56:43.442 --> 56:44.523
Aye?

56:44.902 --> 56:46.143
Your leg.

56:47.279 --> 56:49.566
Catholic nuns and such like.

56:50.949 --> 56:52.406
You must've misheard.

57:00.334 --> 57:05.295
- I told that dumb bastard...
- Yep. Them eaves be gonners.

57:05.297 --> 57:08.210
"Give me your cant hook," I says to him.

57:08.842 --> 57:13.007
But... Foreman Winslow,

57:13.013 --> 57:16.552
that goddamned Canady bastard...

57:16.558 --> 57:19.551
- Winslow?
- ...always callin' me a dog.

57:19.561 --> 57:21.018
A filthy dog.

57:21.021 --> 57:23.684
- I'll show you who's a dog.
- Winslow.

57:24.566 --> 57:27.400
- What of him?
- Who, Winslow?

57:28.737 --> 57:30.319
The eaves be fallin'...

57:30.405 --> 57:33.489
- He's always raggin' on me.
- Ragging?

57:33.492 --> 57:37.862
Like you. Damn fool nonsense.

57:38.372 --> 57:40.159
That's the trouble with ye, Winslow.

57:40.165 --> 57:45.285
Trouble with you is eatin' grass
without no teeth.

57:45.754 --> 57:47.040
Come now?

57:49.424 --> 57:53.589
Your sea matey's teeth had fallen out.

57:57.766 --> 57:59.257
What are ye gettin' at, Winslow?

57:59.559 --> 58:03.052
Ah. Well, it just seems powerful hard

58:05.190 --> 58:08.729
to eat grass with no teeth.

58:09.945 --> 58:13.359
'Cause goats and sheeps and cows,

58:13.365 --> 58:17.905
well, now, they all got teeth, don't they?

58:20.664 --> 58:24.283
Y'know how y'eat grass without your teeth?

58:26.044 --> 58:27.285
Oblige me.

58:27.295 --> 58:29.708
Ye rip it out and ye swallow it.

58:33.468 --> 58:35.801
"You rip it out and you swallow it."

58:35.804 --> 58:40.970
- Ye rip it out...
- I don't know 'bout that.

58:41.977 --> 58:42.977
Y'don't?

58:43.311 --> 58:44.427
I don't.

58:58.160 --> 58:59.321
What?

59:02.539 --> 59:03.746
What?

59:07.294 --> 59:08.455
What?

59:10.672 --> 59:12.004
What?

59:12.549 --> 59:13.881
What?

59:13.884 --> 59:20.736
- What?
- What?

59:20.849 --> 59:22.841
What?

59:24.102 --> 59:25.638
- That's what I mean!
- What?

59:26.646 --> 59:28.387
That's the trouble with you.

59:28.398 --> 59:29.559
That's the trouble with ye!

59:29.566 --> 59:30.807
- With you!
- With ye!

59:30.859 --> 59:33.522
No! No!

59:34.905 --> 59:36.771
I want a steak!

59:37.199 --> 59:39.486
I want a goddamned steak!

59:39.576 --> 59:40.817
I...

59:40.827 --> 59:43.695
If I had a steak... Oh, boy.

59:43.705 --> 59:46.664
A... A rare, a bloody steak.

59:46.666 --> 59:49.079
If I... If I had a steak,

59:50.170 --> 59:51.627
I would fuck it.

59:57.260 --> 59:58.876
You don't like me cookin'?

59:58.887 --> 01:00:00.753
Ugh, don't be such an old bitch!

01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:04.928
You're drunk!
You don't know what you're talkin'.

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:08.599
How could I possibly like
the horseshit you fix us for supper?

01:00:08.647 --> 01:00:11.731
You're drunk,
or ye wouldn't be saying that!

01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:14.817
Them tin kitchen shanty cooks
gave us fried doughnuts three times a day

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:17.381
- and country ham bigger than your fist.
- You're drunk! You're drunk! You're drunk!

01:00:17.405 --> 01:00:19.613
- I'm drunk? I...
- You heard me!

01:00:20.325 --> 01:00:21.907
- You've been drunk...
- Damn ye!

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:24.778
Drunk since I first laid eyes on you.

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:27.204
You're fond of me lobster, ain't ye?

01:00:27.582 --> 01:00:29.198
You're drunker than a Virginy fence.

01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:32.702
I seen it. You're fond of me lobster.

01:00:34.548 --> 01:00:35.789
Say it.

01:00:37.676 --> 01:00:38.883
Say it.

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:41.253
Say it!

01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:43.887
I don't have to say nothin'.

01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:45.135
Damn ye!

01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:49.811
Let Neptune strike ye dead, Winslow!

01:00:50.689 --> 01:00:53.727
Hark!

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:57.818
Hark, Triton, Hark!

01:00:59.364 --> 01:01:03.825
Bellow, bid our father, the sea king,

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:08.322
rise from the depths,
full foul in his fury,

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:11.950
black waves teeming with salt-foam,

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:16.625
to smother this young mouth
with pungent slime,

01:01:16.631 --> 01:01:22.673
to choke ye, engorging your organs
till ye turn blue and bloated

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:26.298
with bilge and brine
and can scream no more.

01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:31.307
Only when he, crowned in cockle shells

01:01:31.313 --> 01:01:36.104
with slithering tentacled tail
and steaming beard,

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:40.319
take up his fell, be-finned arm,

01:01:40.322 --> 01:01:43.030
his coral-tined trident screeches,

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:45.650
banshee-like in the tempest,

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:48.824
and plunges right through your gullet,

01:01:50.165 --> 01:01:55.331
bursting ye, a bulging bladder no more,

01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:58.208
but a blasted bloody film now,

01:01:58.215 --> 01:02:03.461
a nothing for the harpies
and the souls of dead sailors

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:06.338
to peck and claw and feed upon,

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:11.768
only to be lapped up and swallowed
by the infinite waters

01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:14.888
of the dread emperor himself,

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:17.940
forgotten to any man,

01:02:19.444 --> 01:02:21.151
to any time,

01:02:21.154 --> 01:02:26.650
forgotten to any god or devil,
forgotten even to the sea,

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:33.533
for any stuff or part of Winslow,
even any scantling of your soul,

01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:36.500
is Winslow no more,

01:02:36.503 --> 01:02:41.214
but is now itself the sea.

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:51.298
All right. Have it your way.

01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:52.849
I like your cooking.

01:04:20.398 --> 01:04:21.764
Son of a bitch.

01:05:46.484 --> 01:05:49.568
Queer way to wear your shoes.

01:05:54.117 --> 01:05:56.154
Just didn't wanna wake you, is all.

01:05:58.872 --> 01:06:00.113
It's a long night.

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:02.873
And such.

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:05.747
Hmm. The sun is over the yardarm.

01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:10.339
Best find some winks
afore the day draws farther on.

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:19.011
Get back to your duties
or I'll give you a real keelhauling.

01:06:31.946 --> 01:06:34.233
You ain't even human no more.

01:06:36.034 --> 01:06:38.447
Workin' apart from folks so long.

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:41.320
You're only tolerable when you're drunk.

01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:43.163
Get to work, says I.

01:06:43.958 --> 01:06:45.244

01:12:02.693 --> 01:12:04.434
- Thomas.
- Aye.

01:12:05.446 --> 01:12:07.904
- It's Thomas.
- Aye.

01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:11.366
No, I'm Thomas.

01:12:12.203 --> 01:12:14.570
I'm Thomas. You're Ephraim.

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:17.664
I lied.

01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:21.293
Well, I'll be scuppered.

01:12:23.506 --> 01:12:26.294
I'm Thomas. Tommy.

01:12:26.717 --> 01:12:30.586
Tommy? Tommy Winslow.

01:12:31.556 --> 01:12:33.297
No. Tom Howard.

01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:36.008
What's Winslow?

01:12:36.936 --> 01:12:38.893
- It's nothing.
- Nothing?

01:12:43.651 --> 01:12:44.937
Can I trust you?

01:12:46.571 --> 01:12:49.154
Don't be spilling any of your beans to me.

01:12:49.615 --> 01:12:50.856
I ain't interested.

01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:53.484
No. It wasn't that way, is all...
Just, see...

01:12:53.494 --> 01:12:56.282
I see what you're fixin' to do.
You get me all liquored up...

01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:59.373
Your guilty conscience
is ever as tiresome-borin'

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:01.662
as any a guilty conscience.

01:13:01.919 --> 01:13:04.161
- Who...
- Worse. Worse.

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:06.751
It was... it was a drive, see.

01:13:06.799 --> 01:13:11.965
It was a log drive,
and he... he's raggin' on me.

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:16.473
No, I see what you're doing.

01:13:16.475 --> 01:13:17.556
Nothing.

01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:24.815
Look, Tom, don't be working
to twist words out of my head.

01:13:24.817 --> 01:13:26.058
I ain't.

01:13:27.194 --> 01:13:30.062
Um, I can't... I can't do it. I can't...

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:32.860
Shut up your own rag box.

01:13:33.701 --> 01:13:38.321
I trust... I trust... I trust you.

01:13:38.331 --> 01:13:39.617
No.

01:13:41.292 --> 01:13:44.330
I... I trust you, Tom.

01:13:45.296 --> 01:13:46.662
You trust me?

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:53.255
No, I don't trust you at all.

01:14:14.742 --> 01:14:17.985
And I had 'im handy and helpless.

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:20.616
Alone.

01:14:21.582 --> 01:14:23.790
Too far downstream.

01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:30.539
And I... I wanted to do 'im in.
I admit I did.

01:14:32.343 --> 01:14:35.802
Seein' the back of his head.

01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:40.803
One swipe of the cant hook'd be all.

01:14:42.228 --> 01:14:43.810
Uh... It was...

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:47.681
I... I didn't...

01:14:49.026 --> 01:14:51.484
I didn't... I did not.

01:14:54.573 --> 01:14:57.987
The day was long as hell on that drive.

01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:01.703
I was lead-tired. I admit it.

01:15:03.124 --> 01:15:05.616
But I saw him slippin', not me.

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:09.411
We saw the jam comin'.

01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:12.960
I stood and he slipped.

01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:18.004
He shouted up.
And I... I just stood there.

01:15:20.725 --> 01:15:22.717
"Tom, you dog!"

01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:27.562
I just stood there, is all. Just...

01:15:28.774 --> 01:15:33.314
Just stood and watched 'im
get swallowed by them logs.

01:15:36.323 --> 01:15:39.282
And all I could think
when he was done was,

01:15:40.661 --> 01:15:42.948
"I... I could use me a smoke."

01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:45.868
That's it.

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:52.625
So, I packed up his kit and fixin's,
as if they was my own and...

01:15:53.299 --> 01:15:57.464
Ephraim Winslow, well, now,
he got a spiffy clean slate.

01:15:58.304 --> 01:16:01.797
And Thomas Howard, well, he don't.

01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:04.761
No prospects.

01:16:08.606 --> 01:16:11.394
How else am I gonna find respectable work?

01:16:16.947 --> 01:16:18.233
Tom!

01:16:22.953 --> 01:16:24.114
Tom!

01:16:35.007 --> 01:16:39.001
Why'd y'spill your beans, Tommy?

01:16:50.898 --> 01:16:53.515
Why'd y'spill your beans?

01:16:59.615 --> 01:17:02.824
Why'd y'spill your beans?

01:18:25.618 --> 01:18:26.859
Don't leave me!

01:19:03.489 --> 01:19:06.482
You crazy son of a bitch!
You smashed up the lifeboat!

01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:09.154
You're abandoning your post!

01:19:19.338 --> 01:19:22.206
What're you gonna do?
Send for the lighthouse establishment?

01:19:22.299 --> 01:19:27.419
Certain, says I. I'll report ye,
I'll bring the inspector up.

01:19:27.513 --> 01:19:30.631
I'll report you! I know what you done.

01:19:30.641 --> 01:19:35.932
Who's reportin' who?
Ephraim Winslow? Or Thomas Howard?

01:19:36.272 --> 01:19:38.184
I know what you done.

01:19:38.274 --> 01:19:39.606
You killed your second.

01:19:44.071 --> 01:19:45.653
Your one-eyed junior man.

01:19:47.908 --> 01:19:51.151
I found him. In the lobster pot.

01:19:53.414 --> 01:19:54.780
Said he went mad?

01:19:56.417 --> 01:19:59.581
You made him mad with that charm!

01:20:01.005 --> 01:20:02.371
That scrimshaw trinket.

01:20:03.424 --> 01:20:06.792
But I broke it, see. See?

01:20:08.137 --> 01:20:11.801
Now I'm free. I'm free from your designs!

01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:19.137
And I got it all figured out,

01:20:19.148 --> 01:20:23.142
'cept what's the secret mischief
your keepin' up there!

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:28.070
Jesus, Mary and Joseph, Tommy.

01:20:29.491 --> 01:20:33.326
Last night you made a confession
'twould make a saint swear.

01:20:34.538 --> 01:20:36.074
I don't have nothin' to confess,

01:20:36.081 --> 01:20:40.166
but you, spillin' your beans,
look what it's done to ye.

01:20:40.502 --> 01:20:42.289
It's made ye mad.

01:20:43.881 --> 01:20:48.421
And I knew ye was mad
when y'smashed up that lifeboat just now,

01:20:48.427 --> 01:20:51.716
a-chasing me with an ax,
tryin' to kill Ol' Tom.

01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:55.340
Don't ye trust me, Tommy?

01:20:59.938 --> 01:21:03.056
Better hand me
the dinner knife ye pocketed.

01:21:03.067 --> 01:21:04.148
Y'ain't safe with it.

01:21:15.621 --> 01:21:17.283
That's a good lad.

01:21:18.832 --> 01:21:20.744
Them's government property.

01:21:28.634 --> 01:21:30.500
Deducted from your pay.

01:21:32.054 --> 01:21:34.137
Look at your shiverin'.

01:21:35.265 --> 01:21:38.429
You're so mad, y'know not up from down.

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:44.814
How long have we been on this rock?

01:21:45.859 --> 01:21:47.020
Five weeks?

01:21:47.444 --> 01:21:48.560
Two days?

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:51.525
Where are we?

01:21:52.491 --> 01:21:57.486
Help me to recollect,
who are you again, Tommy?

01:21:58.872 --> 01:22:01.865
I'm probably
a figment of your imagination.

01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:06.290
This rock is a figment
of your imagination too.

01:22:07.881 --> 01:22:14.003
You're probably wand'rin' through a grove
of tag alders up north in Canady,

01:22:14.012 --> 01:22:19.007
like a frostbitten maniac,
talkin' to yourself,

01:22:19.518 --> 01:22:21.510
knee-deep in snow.

01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:46.826
I could use me a smoke.

01:22:50.048 --> 01:22:51.334
We're outta drink.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.457
Ooh!

01:23:26.919 --> 01:23:29.036
Monkey pump!

01:24:57.759 --> 01:24:59.466
This place is a sty.

01:25:01.847 --> 01:25:03.304
Mornin' to you too.

01:25:10.314 --> 01:25:12.055
I wish I could go for a walk.

01:25:12.274 --> 01:25:15.312
Be my guest. You'll get drowned.

01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:58.286
Fiery pit.

01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:07.090
Ain't there no justice left in this world?

01:27:16.314 --> 01:27:17.600
Thankee.

01:27:18.942 --> 01:27:20.478
What's wrong with your hand?

01:27:24.823 --> 01:27:26.155
The other one.

01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:30.822
Ye hear o' tetanus?

01:27:31.663 --> 01:27:34.155
- Tet-a-nus?
- Hmm. Yeah.

01:27:34.166 --> 01:27:36.249
It started as a sliver of a cut, is all...

01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:37.332
I said I heard of it.

01:27:37.335 --> 01:27:39.748
...from the forestaysail
when we shoved off...

01:27:39.755 --> 01:27:41.337
- Don't you ever shut up?
- ...but come a fortnight,

01:27:41.339 --> 01:27:43.626
- the bosun was a-shakin'.
- Stop.

01:27:43.633 --> 01:27:46.967
His jaw locked tighter than an anchor...

01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:49.553
Shut your gum, goddamn it!
I can't hear no more!

01:27:49.639 --> 01:27:51.551
What were it ye accused me of?

01:27:52.476 --> 01:27:54.638
Y'already told me y'had me figgerd.

01:27:55.604 --> 01:28:02.101
I'm tired of your damned-fool yarns
and your Cap'n Ahab horseshit.

01:28:02.652 --> 01:28:05.019
You sound like a goddamned parody.

01:28:05.781 --> 01:28:09.695
Givin' and nagging orders
like a spinster schoolmarm,

01:28:09.785 --> 01:28:11.367
and all the while turning this station

01:28:11.369 --> 01:28:13.577
- to the Devil's own rum hole.
- You're makin' a fool of yourself.

01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:15.287
Well, it's all horseshit...

01:28:16.458 --> 01:28:21.203
your leg, and your sea life, all of it!

01:28:22.255 --> 01:28:27.421
And if I hear one more word of horseshit
coming out of your foul, rotten-toothed,

01:28:27.427 --> 01:28:29.885
- smelly old mouth...
- Ye... Damn ye...

01:28:29.888 --> 01:28:32.722
Shut up your gum, goddamn it!
I ain't finished yet!

01:28:33.975 --> 01:28:36.638
You think
you're so goddamned high and mighty

01:28:36.645 --> 01:28:39.012
just 'cause
you're a goddamned lighthouse keeper?

01:28:39.898 --> 01:28:42.356
Well, you ain't a captain of no ship
and you never was!

01:28:42.776 --> 01:28:46.144
You ain't no general, you ain't no copper,

01:28:46.154 --> 01:28:48.567
you ain't the president,
and you ain't my father!

01:28:49.032 --> 01:28:51.024
And I'm sick of you actin' like you is!

01:28:51.952 --> 01:28:58.074
I'm sick of your laughing, your snoring,
and your goddamned farts.

01:28:58.333 --> 01:29:00.575
Your goddamned...

01:29:01.419 --> 01:29:03.706
Goddamn your farts!

01:29:04.798 --> 01:29:09.338
You smell like piss,
you smell like jism,

01:29:10.262 --> 01:29:13.881
like rotten dick, like curdled foreskin,

01:29:14.474 --> 01:29:17.717
like hot onions fucked
a farmyard shit house.

01:29:17.727 --> 01:29:20.185
And I'm sick of your smell.
I'm sick of it!

01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:21.975
I'm sick of it, you goddamned drunk.

01:29:21.982 --> 01:29:25.942
You goddamned no-account,
son-of-a-bitch-bastard liar!

01:29:25.944 --> 01:29:27.310
That's what you are!

01:29:27.821 --> 01:29:34.739
You're a goddamned drunken,
horse-shitting, short, shit liar.

01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:36.577
A liar!

01:29:42.794 --> 01:29:44.877
Ye have a way with words, Tommy.

01:29:45.964 --> 01:29:48.206
Damn you!

01:29:51.386 --> 01:29:53.673
You're relieved of your duties.

01:29:56.266 --> 01:29:58.474
No need to tell me, old-timer.

01:30:10.322 --> 01:30:12.029
"Assistant slept late."

01:30:12.532 --> 01:30:14.023
"Work below standard."

01:30:14.576 --> 01:30:16.943
"Attitude hostile."

01:30:19.998 --> 01:30:21.409
"Assistant missing."

01:30:21.917 --> 01:30:26.753
"Given to habitual self-abuse
in the supply shed."

01:30:29.174 --> 01:30:30.756
"Drunk on duty!"

01:30:31.259 --> 01:30:32.420
"Assault!"

01:30:32.802 --> 01:30:33.883
"Theft!"

01:30:34.596 --> 01:30:38.135
"Recommend severance without pay."

01:30:38.892 --> 01:30:41.384
Severance without pay?

01:30:42.896 --> 01:30:44.432
Are you trying to ruin me?

01:30:45.523 --> 01:30:46.889
I'm a hard worker.

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:50.234
I am. I work as hard as any man.

01:30:50.236 --> 01:30:52.353
- Ye lie, Thomas.
- Stop it!

01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:56.111
Ye lie to yourself,
but y'ain't have the sauce to see it.

01:30:56.117 --> 01:30:57.403
Please...

01:30:59.788 --> 01:31:01.620
Just let me into the light, old man.

01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:06.250
I've learned so much from you.
Just let me show you. Another chance.

01:31:06.795 --> 01:31:08.878
Forgive and forget, I says.

01:31:09.756 --> 01:31:11.588
Just let me into that lantern, is all.

01:31:12.467 --> 01:31:15.084
Don't make me beg... or I'll beg.

01:31:15.095 --> 01:31:17.007
I'll beg if that's what you want.
I'll beg.

01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:20.006
Please.

01:31:21.393 --> 01:31:24.682
Please. Please! Please!

01:31:25.105 --> 01:31:26.221
Stand down.

01:31:27.941 --> 01:31:31.434
You selfish bastard!
Keepin' it all to yourself.

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:36.109
You left your old lady,
your children, for what? For what?

01:31:36.116 --> 01:31:41.737
Look at ye, handsome lad,
with eyes bright as a lady.

01:31:42.747 --> 01:31:45.455
Come to this rock playin' the tough.

01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:49.084
Ye make me laugh with your false grum.

01:31:49.963 --> 01:31:54.048
Ye pretended to some mystery
in your quietudes,

01:31:54.050 --> 01:31:57.384
but there ain't no mystery.

01:31:58.471 --> 01:32:01.930
You're an open book. A picture, says I.

01:32:03.435 --> 01:32:07.145
A painted actress
screaming in the footlights,

01:32:07.147 --> 01:32:10.891
a bitch what wants to be coveted
for nothin' but being born,

01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:13.893
cryin' 'bout the silver spoon
what should've been yours.

01:32:15.655 --> 01:32:19.239
Now look at ye cryin'.

01:32:20.368 --> 01:32:22.451
Boo. Boo.

01:32:23.329 --> 01:32:24.911
What you gonna do?

01:32:25.915 --> 01:32:29.158
Will ye kill me? Will ye?

01:32:30.003 --> 01:32:32.336
Will y'kill me like y'done that gull?

01:32:32.422 --> 01:32:35.915
- I didn't...
- Liar! Y'murdering dog!

01:32:36.217 --> 01:32:41.884
'Twas ye what changed the wind on us.
'Twas ye what damned us, dog. 'Twas ye!

01:32:42.223 --> 01:32:46.308
Will y'do what y'wish
y'done to Ol' Winslow?

01:32:46.311 --> 01:32:49.600
Will ye best me then?
For Winslow were right.

01:32:49.606 --> 01:32:54.818
Thomas, you're a dog. A filthy dog! A dog!

01:33:06.956 --> 01:33:08.037
Git down!

01:33:12.212 --> 01:33:13.328
Let go of me!

01:34:14.774 --> 01:34:16.436
You're killing me!

01:34:56.900 --> 01:34:57.981
Bark.

01:35:02.947 --> 01:35:04.358
Bark, boy.

01:35:06.451 --> 01:35:07.692
Bark, laddie.

01:35:09.704 --> 01:35:10.785
Bark.

01:35:14.667 --> 01:35:15.783
Woof.

01:35:16.461 --> 01:35:18.498
Ain't ye never been to sea before?

01:35:18.963 --> 01:35:21.000
Bark, I says. Bark!

01:35:21.007 --> 01:35:24.045
Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!

01:35:24.052 --> 01:35:25.543
Bark, laddie!

01:35:26.304 --> 01:35:29.138
Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!

01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:31.132
- Now, there's a good boy.
- Ruff!

01:35:32.310 --> 01:35:36.304
- There's a good dog.
- Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!

01:35:37.815 --> 01:35:38.976
Ruff!

01:35:40.276 --> 01:35:41.437
Now roll over.

01:35:58.544 --> 01:35:59.705
Come on.

01:36:00.505 --> 01:36:02.212
Come on.

01:36:11.724 --> 01:36:13.511
Git!

01:36:23.987 --> 01:36:25.353
Come on.

01:36:36.874 --> 01:36:38.115
Get up here.

01:36:56.477 --> 01:36:59.015
Good boy. Good boy.

01:37:00.565 --> 01:37:02.648
Now you get in there, where you belong.

01:37:04.777 --> 01:37:06.359
You do as I say, dog.

01:37:11.492 --> 01:37:12.983
There's my good lad.

01:37:27.925 --> 01:37:31.589
Ye wish to see
what's in the lantern?

01:37:33.264 --> 01:37:35.051
So did me last assistant.

01:37:35.141 --> 01:37:36.348
Shut up, old dog!

01:37:38.186 --> 01:37:39.722
Polish your brasswork.

01:37:41.773 --> 01:37:47.314
O what Protean forms swim up
from men's minds,

01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:51.064
and melt in hot Promethean plunder,

01:37:51.157 --> 01:37:55.117
scorching eyes,
with divine shames and horror...

01:37:57.246 --> 01:38:01.832
And casting them down to Davy Jones.

01:38:02.210 --> 01:38:05.669
The others, still blind,

01:38:05.671 --> 01:38:08.755
yet in it see

01:38:08.758 --> 01:38:13.173
all the divine graces

01:38:13.888 --> 01:38:18.724
and to Fiddler's Green sent,

01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:25.565
where no man is suffered to want or toil,
but is...

01:38:27.193 --> 01:38:28.400
ancient...

01:38:29.695 --> 01:38:32.813
mutable and unchanging...

01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:39.992
as the she who girdles 'round the globe.

01:38:41.874 --> 01:38:43.081
Them's truth.

01:38:44.836 --> 01:38:46.202
You'll be punished.

01:40:15.801 --> 01:40:17.884
The light belongs to me!

01:41:09.939 --> 01:41:15.310
Should pale death with treble dread
make the ocean caves our bed,

01:41:17.071 --> 01:41:21.736
God who hear'st the surges roll,
deign to save the suppliant soul.
