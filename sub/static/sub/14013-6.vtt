<i>In the criminal</i>

00:26.259 --> 00:29.990
<i>the people are represented</i>

00:30.063 --> 00:31.997

<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:39.706 --> 00:41.003
Well, I'm sorry
for the wait.

00:41.074 --> 00:42.098
Oh, it's okay.

00:42.175 --> 00:44.405
Uh, did you bring
the menstrual chart
we gave you?

00:44.477 --> 00:46.138
It's right here.

00:46.546 --> 00:49.674
And, uh, your last period,
it ended...

00:49.749 --> 00:51.683
(Olivet)
Saturday.

00:52.052 --> 00:55.510
Well, pretty sporadic, huh?
Cramps still abnormal?

00:55.588 --> 00:58.386
Yeah, it's... it's never been
like this before.

00:58.958 --> 01:00.653
Well, let's take a look,
shall we?

01:00.727 --> 01:02.251
Will you lie down?

01:05.865 --> 01:07.765
[Water running]

01:20.146 --> 01:22.478
Um, come a little closer,
please.

01:24.517 --> 01:26.314
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

01:26.786 --> 01:27.980
Okay.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.923
[Exhaling]

01:36.062 --> 01:37.427
Eternity?

01:39.732 --> 01:40.756
What?

01:40.967 --> 01:42.025
Your perfume.

01:43.870 --> 01:45.337
Am I right?

01:46.406 --> 01:49.341
Uh-uh. Uh-huh.

01:51.611 --> 01:53.602
I've always loved Eternity.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.046
Smells of clean sheets.

01:57.684 --> 02:01.176
Relax, relax.
You're tensing.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.526
How does that feel?

02:11.664 --> 02:12.824
Fine.

02:17.036 --> 02:18.435
Just fine?

02:19.906 --> 02:21.635
What do you mean?

02:22.942 --> 02:24.341
It should feel good.

02:24.744 --> 02:26.143
Well, it doesn't.

02:28.314 --> 02:29.645
Ah, yes.

02:30.216 --> 02:32.116
Please don't do that.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.410
Yes, right there.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.181
I said to stop it!

02:37.657 --> 02:41.855
We're gonna have to do
an endometrial biopsy
as soon as possible.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.126
What?

02:44.197 --> 02:45.926
It's a diagnostic procedure.

02:45.999 --> 02:49.162
At your age
cancer can become
a consideration.

02:49.569 --> 02:50.866
Cancer?

02:51.237 --> 02:52.568
We can't
rule it out.

02:53.339 --> 02:56.604
You can schedule it
with Miriam on your way out.

[Sighing]

03:06.853 --> 03:08.718
[Phone ringing]

03:09.722 --> 03:13.852
I know the difference
between being examined
and being molested.

03:15.795 --> 03:18.161
Did you confront him
with it?

03:18.431 --> 03:20.331
I mean, was he aware?

03:20.733 --> 03:23.258
He knew exactly
what he was doing.

03:26.339 --> 03:27.931
[Car horn honking]

03:34.547 --> 03:35.946
[Sighing]

03:36.716 --> 03:38.411
How do you know?

03:43.556 --> 03:47.390
Afterwards he tried
to intimidate me
by bringing up cancer.

03:49.329 --> 03:52.093
We'd never talked
about cancer before.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.827
It was a threat.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.329
What did he actually do?

03:59.639 --> 04:01.038
What do you mean?

04:01.107 --> 04:02.540
Well, he's a doctor.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.706
Isn't he supposed
to touch you?

04:06.379 --> 04:08.142
Um, isn't that his job?

04:10.984 --> 04:14.283
I've been seeing
a gynecologist since I was 15.

04:15.788 --> 04:18.086
It never made me
feel dirty.

05:45.745 --> 05:47.508
Did she run this
by Sex Crimes?

05:47.580 --> 05:49.980
Yeah, I wish to hell
she had gone to the One-Nine.

05:50.049 --> 05:51.346
But the fact is
she came to us.

05:51.417 --> 05:52.645
You can't blame her.

05:52.719 --> 05:56.280
Something like this happens,
you go where you have credit.

05:56.422 --> 05:57.411
Okay.

05:57.523 --> 05:59.388
So, we spend what?
Two, three weeks

05:59.459 --> 06:01.051
running this thing
around the block.

06:01.127 --> 06:03.755
Maybe we get
some DA to prosecute,

06:03.863 --> 06:06.593
maybe he gets lucky
and we convict him.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.792
Best-case scenario,
the guy gets six months.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.234
Worst case, a $500 fine
and a "Don't do it again."

06:11.304 --> 06:14.467
Any way you toss this,
it's Sex Abuse Three.
It's a misdemeanor.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.405
Yeah, but if you add up
the misdemeanors.

06:16.476 --> 06:17.875
That's a big assumption, Phil.

06:17.944 --> 06:19.878
How many
one-time sex offenders
do we know?

06:19.946 --> 06:21.675
I mean, if he's
gonna do this to Liz...

06:21.748 --> 06:24.148
Oh, I doubt
if he knew that she's
our in-house shrink.

06:24.217 --> 06:27.084
I say, we at least see
if anyone else
ever complained.

06:27.153 --> 06:28.620
But by the book, fellows.

06:28.688 --> 06:30.383
Just like
any other victim.

06:37.864 --> 06:39.729
You know how many complaints
we get a year?

06:39.799 --> 06:40.823
You don't wanna know.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.162
You're wrong.
We do.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.896
Merritt, Alex J., MD.
What do you have?

06:43.970 --> 06:45.437
Complaints are confidential

06:45.505 --> 06:47.905
unless, of course,
disciplinary action was taken.

06:48.007 --> 06:49.031
Well?

06:49.108 --> 06:50.666
Well, that's hard
to say, too.

06:50.743 --> 06:53.507
Disciplinary files
are routinely destroyed
after five years.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.740
Mr. Hauser,
we are not paid by the hour.

06:55.815 --> 06:57.544
Was there any
disciplinary action

06:57.617 --> 07:00.950
taken against Dr. Merritt
in the past five years?

07:01.387 --> 07:03.719
I've had teeth
pulled easier.

07:10.062 --> 07:12.087
(Hauser)
Gentlemen, you've hit
the mother lode.

07:12.165 --> 07:13.189
You got something?

07:13.266 --> 07:14.255
(Hauser)
No. You do.

07:31.384 --> 07:32.874
This guy
can't sit still.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.943
Big shot like that,
hospitals fight over him.

07:35.021 --> 07:37.683
He signs a contract
for five years
then he's a free agent.

07:37.757 --> 07:39.019
He's off
to the highest bidder.

07:39.091 --> 07:40.080
[Phone ringing]

07:40.159 --> 07:41.148
Excuse me.

07:42.228 --> 07:43.923
I hope to God
these free agents

07:43.996 --> 07:45.827
do a better job
than the ones out at Shea.

07:45.898 --> 07:49.026
You bat 310,
everybody's happy,
you play out your contract.

07:49.101 --> 07:52.093
You go down to 220,
whoa, everybody's looking
for a trade, right?

07:52.171 --> 07:54.264
This guy said
Merritt signed
five-year contracts.

07:54.340 --> 07:55.329
So his last gig...

07:55.408 --> 07:56.432
Manattan General.

07:56.509 --> 07:58.807
He was there from '88 to '90.
Three years.

07:58.878 --> 08:01.972
Could be our good doctor
was in a major slump.

08:02.882 --> 08:04.645
Alex Merritt
is one of the best.

08:04.717 --> 08:06.514
So why'd you let him go?

08:06.719 --> 08:10.314
We're aware that doctors
of his caliber usually sign on
for five years.

08:10.389 --> 08:11.879
Dr. Merritt left
after three.

08:11.958 --> 08:13.289
Was
an administrative decision.

08:13.359 --> 08:14.519
His or yours?

08:14.594 --> 08:16.858
Dr. Merritt lives uptown.
We're downtown.

08:16.929 --> 08:19.397
Maybe he, uh,
was unappy about the commute.

08:19.465 --> 08:20.864
(Cerreta)
What about his patients?

08:20.933 --> 08:22.298
Were they happy
when he got here?

08:22.368 --> 08:24.131
Dr. Merritt has
a fine practice.

08:24.203 --> 08:25.898
Whatever you're thinking,
you're wrong.

08:25.972 --> 08:27.371
I tell you
what I'm thinking, Doc.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.601
I think your esteemed
colleague screwed up.

08:29.675 --> 08:32.667
Now you cover his rectum
and he covers yours.

08:32.745 --> 08:34.770
We could
subpoena your records,
Dr. Reitman.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.837
Don't bother.
You want his file?

08:36.916 --> 08:38.941
Take it.
There's nothing in it.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.842
At the academy
we had the honor code.

08:41.921 --> 08:44.583
If you knew
somebody was cheating,
you had to turn him in

08:44.657 --> 08:46.648
or it was your butt
that got burned.
These guys put in

08:46.692 --> 08:50.128
an extra four years of school,
everybody's looking
the other way.

08:50.196 --> 08:53.461
Everybody's nervous
when they're lookir down
the barrel of a lawsuit.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.331
Doctors may not wanna talk.
I'm not so sure
about patients.

08:56.402 --> 08:57.596
Especially the unappy ones.

08:57.670 --> 08:59.433
A Park Avenue medicine man
like Merritt.

08:59.505 --> 09:01.200
I figure he doesn't
do his own billing.

09:01.274 --> 09:03.299
Would the billing service
put an asterisk

09:03.376 --> 09:04.900
next to the names
that are molested?

09:04.977 --> 09:06.137
Let me ask you
a question.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.373
They overcook your macaroni
in an Italian restaurant.

09:08.447 --> 09:10.108
You ever go back there?

09:11.250 --> 09:13.684
Let's check
the billing service.

09:14.487 --> 09:18.184
I tell you,
this guy's patient list
reads like the <i>Forbes</i> 400.

09:18.291 --> 09:21.624
At $150 a pop,
the good doctor should be
at the top of the list.

09:21.694 --> 09:23.628
Here we go.
Donna Marx.

09:23.696 --> 09:26.597
Regular visits
every four months
until last July.

09:26.666 --> 09:27.724
Nothing since.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.062
Maybe she got cured.

09:29.135 --> 09:30.500
Of being a woman?

09:32.705 --> 09:35.196
Hold on.
Listen to this.

09:36.142 --> 09:39.077
Diane Perkins.
Clockwork until last May.

09:39.145 --> 09:40.612
Ever since
the clock stopped.

09:42.615 --> 09:44.310

for three years.

09:44.383 --> 09:46.044
Nothing since April.

09:46.152 --> 09:48.143
Well, hey, I'm ready.
Let's go.

09:48.220 --> 09:50.654
Okay. First stop, Marx.

09:51.457 --> 09:53.220
She's on 21st.
Around the corner

09:53.292 --> 09:55.419
is the best marinara
west of Naples.

09:55.962 --> 09:58.055
(Logan)
So what about Dr. Merritt?

09:58.164 --> 09:59.222
What's he done now?

09:59.298 --> 10:00.322
Excuse me?

10:00.399 --> 10:02.731
Alex certainly likes
to live life on the edge.

10:02.802 --> 10:04.099
Every now and then you slip.

10:04.170 --> 10:06.035
Just how far out on the edge,
Miss Marx?

10:06.105 --> 10:08.869
Wouldrt go there
without a parachute.

10:10.042 --> 10:12.909
Last May.
Uh, did he do anything to you?

10:13.713 --> 10:16.079
(Cerreta)
We know the billing
stopped in May.

10:16.182 --> 10:17.672
Just because
he stopped billing me

10:17.750 --> 10:19.547
doesn't mean
he stopped treating me.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.416
Oh, he worked
pro bono, huh?

10:22.888 --> 10:25.118
Let's call it
an even swap.

10:25.257 --> 10:27.487
But that ended six,
eight weeks ago.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.352
(Cerreta)
If Dr. Merritt
did something to you,

10:30.429 --> 10:32.090
there's no point
in protecting him.

10:33.165 --> 10:35.292
I don't give a damn
about Dr. Merritt.

10:35.368 --> 10:38.860
Look, we played doctor,
all right?
It was good while it lasted.

10:38.938 --> 10:42.032
But eventually his yang
got tired of my yin.

10:42.508 --> 10:45.033
This started when you
were his patient?

10:45.111 --> 10:47.841
Love in the stirrups.
Exciting for a while,

10:47.913 --> 10:50.780
but hell, now I'm seeing
my plastic surgeon.

10:50.950 --> 10:52.713
You only date doctors?

10:52.785 --> 10:55.777
Why not? Something breaks,
they can fix it.

10:57.089 --> 10:59.557
My daughter
is heavily sedated.

10:59.625 --> 11:02.560
I believe that
talking to her now
would have little value.

11:02.628 --> 11:05.722
Did she ever talk to you
about her gynecologist,
Dr. Merritt?

11:05.798 --> 11:08.699
Diane has been
struggling for years
with mental illness.

11:08.768 --> 11:11.202
She talks about
a lot of things.

11:11.270 --> 11:14.933
At this point we don't know
what's real and what's not.

11:15.041 --> 11:17.635
We would really like
to talk to her.

11:17.877 --> 11:21.506
You understand
she's recovering
from a suicide attempt.

11:22.281 --> 11:25.717
I promise we won't
push your daughter,
Mrs. Gaines.

Diane?

12:03.756 --> 12:07.419
Is it hot outside?

12:11.130 --> 12:14.293
Diane, we'd like to ask you
a few questions
about Dr. Merritt.

12:19.638 --> 12:20.627
Yes,

12:22.675 --> 12:26.111
it's always hot
in his office.

12:26.979 --> 12:30.540
Diane, do you remember
the last time you went
to Dr. Merritt's office?

12:32.017 --> 12:35.851
I wore a blue cotton sundress

12:37.123 --> 12:40.581
and no makeup.
He liked that.

12:42.161 --> 12:45.756
He smiled a lot.

12:50.102 --> 12:52.229
You bought me
that dress, Mom.

12:53.172 --> 12:54.935
It was my favorite.

13:03.249 --> 13:05.843
Do you always change horses
in midstream?

13:05.918 --> 13:08.512
No way he'd get near me
or my baby.

13:09.555 --> 13:10.988
Merritt molested you?

13:11.190 --> 13:12.521
Who the hell knows?

13:12.591 --> 13:14.923
I was in so much pain,
he could have
amputated my leg

13:14.994 --> 13:17.224
and I wouldn't have felt it.

13:17.296 --> 13:18.991
You ever have root canal?

13:19.064 --> 13:20.998
It's not one of
my fondest memories.

13:21.066 --> 13:22.897
Well, imagine it
without the gas

13:22.968 --> 13:26.699
and on places
a whole lot more sensitive
than your teeth.

13:26.772 --> 13:30.037
He performed laser surgery
without anesthesia.

13:30.743 --> 13:32.802
But did you report this
to anyone?

13:32.878 --> 13:35.210
The brass
at Manattan General
know me by name.

13:35.281 --> 13:38.216
The State Medical Board
tells me everything
was by the book.

13:38.284 --> 13:40.218
Simply the doctor's choice.

13:40.286 --> 13:42.186
I read about guys like this.
But who'd think

13:42.254 --> 13:44.222
they'd have MDs
next to their names.

13:44.623 --> 13:47.057
Dr. DeSade.
The guy's a sadist.

13:54.633 --> 13:55.622
[Car honking]

13:55.835 --> 13:59.202
There's a reason
complaints by the public
are kept confidential.

13:59.271 --> 14:00.966
It's called CYA.

14:01.574 --> 14:04.372
If we disclosed
every complaint
by every crackpot,

14:04.443 --> 14:06.638
no one would feel comfortable
visiting any doctor.

14:06.712 --> 14:09.579
When you buy a car,
it's caveat emptor.
But a doctor is...

14:09.615 --> 14:12.106
Is human.
Which means sometimes
he makes mistakes.

14:12.184 --> 14:13.913
Are you saying
Merritt made mistakes?

14:13.986 --> 14:18.787
I'm saying
some patient's temperature
stays at 98.9 for two weeks,

14:18.858 --> 14:22.191
first stop is my committee
where they file
a 200-page complaint

14:22.261 --> 14:25.526
with affidavits from everyone
from Aunt Susie
to Rover's vet.

14:25.598 --> 14:28.294
I can't be expected
to take them all seriously.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.528
What about surgery
without anesthesia?

14:30.603 --> 14:33.265
Yes, Miss Todd complained
about Dr. Merritt's procedure.

14:33.339 --> 14:34.897
Yes, we took it seriously.

14:34.974 --> 14:37.033
But no, he did not
do anything wrong.

14:37.109 --> 14:39.873
I thought "bite the bullet"
went out a long time ago.

14:39.945 --> 14:41.708
A lot of people
who die during surgery,

14:41.780 --> 14:43.475
die because of the anesthetic.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.642
My committee reviewed
Dr. Merritt's actions.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.185
We concluded
that everything he did

14:47.253 --> 14:49.778
was in the best interests
of this particular patient.

14:49.855 --> 14:52.653
Oh, good. So only
the patient didn't agree.

14:57.229 --> 14:59.823
You get the feeling
we're chasing our tails here?

14:59.899 --> 15:02.333
The Medical Board
may keep its complaints
a secret.

15:02.401 --> 15:03.925
But the State Supreme Court
does not.

15:04.003 --> 15:05.937
Maybe this guy was sued.

15:08.540 --> 15:10.667
Liz. Is she all right?

15:10.743 --> 15:14.076
She is a psychologist.
If anybody's trained
to handle it, she is.

15:14.146 --> 15:16.376
Nobody trains you
to be a victim.

15:16.448 --> 15:19.008
Merritt. Two R's, two T's.
Alex J.

15:20.486 --> 15:21.680
How far back
should I go?

15:21.754 --> 15:23.312
What is he,
about 50?

15:25.024 --> 15:27.356
How about 1973?

15:27.426 --> 15:29.394
Merritt vs. Merritt.

15:29.495 --> 15:30.655
Coincidence?

15:30.829 --> 15:32.023
A matrimonial.

15:35.868 --> 15:37.392
(Celia)
The doctor's wife.

15:37.836 --> 15:40.361
My generation,
that was as good as it got.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.669
I guess it wasrt that good.

15:42.908 --> 15:46.002
Marriage. Tried it once,
didn't like it.

15:46.078 --> 15:49.377
Maybe it's who
you were married to,
Mrs. Merritt.

15:49.448 --> 15:53.214
When we divorced
Alex took the car,
the furniture.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.617
I threw in the name
for free.

15:56.088 --> 15:58.420
I'm back
to being Celia Walsh.

15:58.524 --> 16:01.015
So how long were you married,
Miss Walsh?

16:01.093 --> 16:03.084
Well, we met his first week
at medical school.

16:03.162 --> 16:04.925
I was a junior.

16:05.030 --> 16:07.794
The day after I graduated,
we married.

16:07.900 --> 16:10.994
The day he completed
his residency, we divorced.

16:11.437 --> 16:15.373
Six joyous years
that took me 10 years
of therapy to forget.

16:15.441 --> 16:16.965
Your husband abused you?

16:17.042 --> 16:20.478
It's odd what one endures
under the heading of love.

16:20.713 --> 16:23.910
I guess I should be happy.
I survived.

16:25.117 --> 16:27.984
The second Mrs. Merritt
wasrt so lucky.

16:28.287 --> 16:30.050
[Phone ringing]

16:37.963 --> 16:39.021
What the hell is this?

16:39.098 --> 16:41.760
That's Teresa Merritt.
The doctor's second wife.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.597
They were only
married two years.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.534
(Logan)
ME called it a suicide.

16:45.604 --> 16:48.232
She's only 23 years old.
Overdose.

16:48.407 --> 16:50.500
(Cragen)
What, you think Merritt
drove her to it?

16:50.576 --> 16:52.601
Come on, Donny.
She was sending a message.

16:52.678 --> 16:53.975
Yeah, she's into kink.

16:54.046 --> 16:55.172
Or maybe not.

16:55.247 --> 16:56.737
Found her
in the doctor's office.

16:56.815 --> 17:00.148
The hood: Uniform of choice
in your finer S & M clubs.

17:00.252 --> 17:02.948
Well, was the hubby in town
when this happened?

17:03.022 --> 17:04.819
Nope. In Vancouver, lecturing.

17:04.890 --> 17:06.550
But this tells us
something about him.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.490
Obviously he's a sadist.

17:08.560 --> 17:11.028
My guess: The wife
didn't like it anymore.

17:11.096 --> 17:13.030
Like it, not like it.
Where's the crime?

17:13.098 --> 17:14.565
A doctor who likes
to hurt people...

17:14.633 --> 17:15.861
Hey, wait... wait.
Wait a minute.

17:15.934 --> 17:17.925
Liz never said anything
about getting hurt.

17:18.002 --> 17:20.164
She said he touched her.
Period.

17:20.239 --> 17:22.867
Whatever track you're on here,
I think it's the wrong one.

17:22.941 --> 17:25.967
Hey, we're barely out the door
and already we got this.

17:26.045 --> 17:29.014
Well, if you had any evidence
that the guy was dangerous...

17:29.114 --> 17:30.547
Maybe we do.

17:31.083 --> 17:32.948
[Phone ringing]

17:33.285 --> 17:34.274
Hmm.

17:34.820 --> 17:37.983
I knew the man was creative,
but I never dreamed
he was into this.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.183
What's that, Miss Marx?

17:39.258 --> 17:40.691
Voyeurism.

17:40.759 --> 17:43.728
Hope to God
I'm not in any
of his photo albums.

17:43.829 --> 17:45.456
Dr. Merritt didn't take these.

17:45.531 --> 17:47.692
These are police photos
of his dead wife.

17:47.766 --> 17:50.030
She killed herself
in his office.

17:50.936 --> 17:53.666
Now I see why he wouldn't
let me wear a hood.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.036
You're into...

17:55.107 --> 17:57.541
Don't knock it, sweetie,
until you've tried it.

17:57.609 --> 17:59.577
So why'd you leave him?

17:59.678 --> 18:01.839
Nothing turned Alex on
like fear.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.814
When I was scared of him,
his rockets fired.

18:03.882 --> 18:06.680
It was great
until he said "boo,"
and I didn't jump.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.242
So he dumped you?

18:09.254 --> 18:11.779
I may be kinky,
but I'm not crazy.

18:12.958 --> 18:14.118
Thanks, Sandy.

18:14.193 --> 18:16.559
He's a lifetime member
of the Marquis Club.

18:16.628 --> 18:17.822
And I'm a member
of the Elks.

18:17.896 --> 18:19.158
Are you gonna
arrest me for it?

18:19.231 --> 18:20.630
There's a big difference,
Donny.

18:20.699 --> 18:22.963
At your monthly meetings
nobody ends up bruised.

18:23.035 --> 18:24.832
It's a private club.
Consenting adults.

18:24.903 --> 18:26.234
Nobody's breaking the law.

18:26.305 --> 18:28.170
Not when one of the adults
doesn't consent.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.140
You show me one.
I'll arrest the guy myself.

18:30.209 --> 18:32.200
Look, I think we can use
some of this stuff

18:32.277 --> 18:33.972
as ammo in Liz's
molestation case.

18:34.046 --> 18:35.138
It shows intent.

18:35.214 --> 18:37.808
And maybe I can
squeeze an apple
and get orange juice.

18:37.883 --> 18:39.544
One has nothing
to do with the other.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.643
In a court of law
it's called inadmissible.

18:41.720 --> 18:44.689
The guy is dangerous.
If he hasn't crossed
the line yet, he will.

18:44.756 --> 18:46.656
And then we'll arrest him.

18:46.725 --> 18:49.888
I'm sorry, fellows,
without more
the DA can't prosecute.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.055
And it's not a good idea
to tell Liz

18:52.131 --> 18:53.996
about Merritt's
extracurricular activities.

18:54.066 --> 18:57.058
Yeah. Why should she know
how lucky she is?

19:02.808 --> 19:04.833
We talked
to everybody we could.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.409
If there were
others who were molested,
they're not talking to us.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.243
That's not unusual.
For most women,

19:10.315 --> 19:12.283
it's too devastating
to even think about.

19:12.351 --> 19:14.842
And if they won't come forward
our hands are tied.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.717
Well, I've come forward.

19:18.023 --> 19:19.581
So what's next?

19:27.799 --> 19:29.699
Did you talk to Stone?

19:30.636 --> 19:32.831
The DA's office said
that getting an indictment

19:32.905 --> 19:35.032
would be like
climbing Mount Everest.

19:35.107 --> 19:38.565
What the hell does that mean?
This guy is not gonna stop.

19:38.644 --> 19:42.740
As long it's just
your word against his,
they will not proceed.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.407
[Siren wailing]

20:07.306 --> 20:10.173
(Dr. Merritt)
Call the lmaging Center,
schedule an ultrasound.

20:11.243 --> 20:12.835
So, how are we today,
Elizabeth?

20:12.911 --> 20:14.003
Uh, little nervous.

20:14.079 --> 20:16.445
Oh, don't be.
It'll all be over
in 30 minutes or less.

20:16.515 --> 20:18.710
Uh, would you lie down,
please?

20:22.020 --> 20:24.580
I'm gonna give you a local.
Miriam.

20:25.424 --> 20:26.891
Lidocaine.

20:28.427 --> 20:29.416
(Olivet)
Oh.

20:29.661 --> 20:30.855
Relax.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.955
Chances are
you won't feel a thing.

20:34.099 --> 20:36.090
At most a little discomfort.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.286
Okay. That'll be all.

21:03.528 --> 21:04.552
[Groans]

21:12.704 --> 21:16.037
All right, we'll just give it
a couple of seconds.

21:21.847 --> 21:23.109
[Panting]

21:36.328 --> 21:38.421
I... I can't

21:39.364 --> 21:40.331

21:41.733 --> 21:42.722
...move.

21:53.478 --> 21:56.845
<i>(woman on PA)</i>
<i>Dr. Marcus, please report</i>
<i>to Recovery Unit Four.</i>

21:57.416 --> 21:59.782
Victim walked in
about 40 minutes ago.

21:59.851 --> 22:02.183
Vaginal pain. Soreness.

22:02.287 --> 22:05.415
Calm as Cayuga's waters,
but that's no indication.

22:05.490 --> 22:06.821
She was raped?

22:06.925 --> 22:09.120
There was penetration,
ejaculation,

22:09.194 --> 22:11.355
no wounds,
but lots of heavy bruising.

22:11.463 --> 22:14.091
He left finger marks
on her thighs.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.758
When Forensics
runs the samples,

22:15.834 --> 22:18.268
we'll know all about the party
of the second part.

22:18.337 --> 22:21.170
I already got a name.
Dr. Alex Merritt.

22:21.807 --> 22:24.571
Gonna make
for some interesting
dinner conversation.

22:24.643 --> 22:29.080
My wife's an OB.
Merritt was the lead examiner
for her comprehensives.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.012
You guys excuse me?

22:36.888 --> 22:39.516
Why do I feel
like taking a shower?

22:39.591 --> 22:42.321
Mike, we didn't tell her
to go there.

22:42.394 --> 22:43.486
I'm gonna call the lab.

22:43.562 --> 22:46.656
See if we can get this thing
put on the top of the list.

22:56.475 --> 22:57.464
[Knocking]

23:17.696 --> 23:19.061
You okay?

23:20.198 --> 23:22.098
I've had better days.

23:32.744 --> 23:36.578
Run the kit, Mike.
Lock the bastard up.

23:39.918 --> 23:42.113
Yeah, well...

23:44.723 --> 23:46.816
You know, I gotta ask you.

23:47.592 --> 23:50.652
What were you thinking,
going back after
what he already did?

23:50.729 --> 23:52.094
That makes a difference?

23:52.164 --> 23:53.631
Of course it does.

23:53.899 --> 23:55.958
Somebody had to stop him.

23:58.437 --> 24:02.771
He drugged me. I don't know.
I think it was diazepam,
I don't know.

24:04.342 --> 24:07.402
Doesrt that remove
any question of consent?

24:07.813 --> 24:11.442
Doesrt that make it Rape One
no matter how you cut it?

24:12.417 --> 24:13.782
You know what's coming.

24:14.219 --> 24:15.379
You've been there.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.751
He'll be on the stand

24:16.822 --> 24:19.518
claiming you asked
for the drug,
that it put you in the mood.

24:19.591 --> 24:22.355
Well, he can claim
whatever he wants.

24:31.303 --> 24:34.329
Here. People's Exhibit One.

24:37.776 --> 24:40.267
She taped it?
She's a Ph.D.

24:40.345 --> 24:42.609
She should've had more sense
than to go back there.

24:42.681 --> 24:44.478
She didn't figure
on being shot up

24:44.549 --> 24:46.210
with a sedative
and then getting raped.

24:46.284 --> 24:48.252
Our problem is that
the sedatives wear off.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.344
Blood scan?

24:49.421 --> 24:50.547
Nothing.

24:50.889 --> 24:53.687
Let's hope
the good doctor's a talker.

24:58.230 --> 25:00.027
<i>(Dr. Merritt on tape)</i>
<i>Oh.</i>

25:00.565 --> 25:02.624
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>You begged for it, bitch.</i>

25:11.910 --> 25:13.605
Be tough talking his way
out of that.

25:13.678 --> 25:16.374
Well, I think we may be
the ones doing
the fast-talking.

25:16.448 --> 25:18.245
A crime committed
against someone

25:18.316 --> 25:19.806
who works for
the police department.

25:19.885 --> 25:21.716
Knee jerk defense.
Entrapment.

25:21.786 --> 25:24.220
Yeah, but she went in
for a biopsy, for God's sake.

25:24.289 --> 25:25.984
She wasrt there
for an examination.

25:26.057 --> 25:27.456
She took that tape recorder.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.893
There's no law
against an ordinary citizen
gathering evidence.

25:30.962 --> 25:32.156
She's not
an ordinary citizen.

25:32.230 --> 25:33.390
She works for us.

25:33.465 --> 25:35.797
Only when we ask
for her help.

25:36.635 --> 25:38.728
Phil, tell me honestly,
was Liz working

25:38.803 --> 25:40.464
on behalf
of the Police Department?

25:40.539 --> 25:42.166
Absolutely not.

25:43.909 --> 25:46.434
Arrest the son of a bitch.

25:53.919 --> 25:55.181
How ironic.

26:00.191 --> 26:01.021
Excuse us, gentlemen.

26:01.493 --> 26:02.585
(Dr. Merritt)
Uh, just a moment.

26:02.627 --> 26:03.491
There's a meeting
going on here.

26:03.562 --> 26:04.790
Please stand up, sir.
What?

26:04.863 --> 26:07.331
Dr. Alexander Merritt,
you're under arrest

26:07.399 --> 26:09.162
for the rape
of Elizabeth Olivet.

26:09.234 --> 26:10.792
You have the right
to remain silent.

26:10.869 --> 26:13.497
Anything you say
may be used against you
in a court of law.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.267
Tell Miriam to call
my lawyer, will you?

26:15.340 --> 26:17.535
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

26:18.043 --> 26:20.568
The victim ID'd
her assailant.
Samples match.

26:20.645 --> 26:22.112
I'd say we're in
pretty good shape.

26:22.180 --> 26:23.875
And I'd say Judge Silver
doesn't agree.

26:23.949 --> 26:25.439
Why else would he
grant my motion

26:25.517 --> 26:27.280
to close the courtroom
to the press, hmm?

26:27.352 --> 26:29.718
Obviously he doesn't want
to destroy an innocent man.

26:29.788 --> 26:31.551
He hasn't heard evidence
to the contrary.

26:31.623 --> 26:33.648
What evidence?
The woman asked me to...

26:33.725 --> 26:34.953
And you drugged her.

26:35.026 --> 26:37.119
Drugged her with what?
He gave her a local.

26:37.195 --> 26:38.992
That doesn't prevent her
from screaming.

26:39.064 --> 26:40.497
The victim said
it was a sedative.

26:40.565 --> 26:41.623
Oh, please.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.600
You take the word
of an hysterical woman

26:43.668 --> 26:45.602
against your own
Forensics experts.

26:45.737 --> 26:47.295
Come on, Ben.

26:47.372 --> 26:49.203
They had a little fun
in the afternoon.

26:49.274 --> 26:51.572
It cannot be rape
when both parties consent.

26:51.643 --> 26:54.703
I saw the bruises.
I heard the tape.
I didn't hear consent.

26:54.779 --> 26:57.077
Mmm-hmm. And you didn't hear
something else, either.

26:57.148 --> 26:59.139
You didn't hear
the word "No."

26:59.217 --> 27:01.151
The woman gets naked,
she spreads her legs,

27:01.219 --> 27:03.084
and then she turns on
a tape recorder?

27:03.154 --> 27:05.418
Didrt I read that
in last month's
<i>Penthouse Forum?</i>

27:05.490 --> 27:08.050
Danielle, she suspected
something would happen.

27:08.259 --> 27:10.887
Gee, Ben, now I know
why you're living alone.

27:10.962 --> 27:13.692
Fact: The only woman who
would knowingly put herself

27:13.765 --> 27:15.892
in a position to get raped
is a policewoman.

27:15.967 --> 27:19.494
So please, go ahead, fellows,
use the tape.
You will open a can

27:19.571 --> 27:22.039
and a hell of a lot
more than worms
are gonna crawl out.

27:22.107 --> 27:25.042
I will give you a hint.
It begins with "E,"
it ends with "T."

27:25.110 --> 27:27.510
And I do not
mean entertainment.

27:31.182 --> 27:33.116
(Dr. Helman)
There were semen samples.

27:33.518 --> 27:35.816
Her vaginal area was bruised.

27:36.154 --> 27:39.146
And there were haematomas
on her calves and thighs.

27:39.257 --> 27:42.021
Would you identify
these photographs,
Dr. Helman?

27:42.127 --> 27:45.460
Yeah. They are the photos
that our rape expert
took of Dr. Olivet

27:45.530 --> 27:47.760
shortly after she arrived
at the hospital.

27:47.832 --> 27:49.629
Offered as evidence,
Your Honor.

27:49.701 --> 27:52.261
Call them
People's 10, 11, and 12.

27:58.977 --> 28:02.879
Dr. Helman, in your opinion,
what happened to Dr. Olivet?

28:02.981 --> 28:04.812
I've been doing
this for six years.

28:04.883 --> 28:06.851
In my opinion,
that woman was raped.

28:07.152 --> 28:08.551
Thank you.

28:11.056 --> 28:13.388
In your six years
of experience, Doctor,

28:13.458 --> 28:16.985
have you ever seen a patient
with vaginal bruising
who was not raped?

28:17.062 --> 28:18.051
Yes.

28:18.129 --> 28:20.154
And did your rape experts
scrape underneath

28:20.231 --> 28:21.823
the fingernails
of the alleged victim?

28:21.900 --> 28:22.958
Yes.

28:23.034 --> 28:25.730
And did they find samples
of the defendant's skin?

28:25.804 --> 28:26.862
No.

28:26.971 --> 28:28.598
Well, doesn't that
typically indicate

28:28.673 --> 28:30.664
that the alleged victim
did not resist?

28:31.176 --> 28:32.165
It might...

28:32.243 --> 28:33.972
In other words,
she might have consented.

28:34.045 --> 28:35.137
Objection.

28:35.547 --> 28:36.639
Withdrawn.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.817
<i>(Dr. Merritt)</i>
<i>Now we'll give it</i>
<i>a couple of seconds.</i>

28:50.128 --> 28:52.494
<i>[Olivet groans]</i>

28:52.731 --> 28:57.668
<i>(Olivet)</i>
<i>I... I can't move.</i>

29:08.046 --> 29:09.513
<i>[Dr. Merritt moaning]</i>

29:10.682 --> 29:11.671
<i>(Dr. Merritt)</i>
<i>Oh.</i>

29:12.884 --> 29:14.875
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

29:17.622 --> 29:19.681
<i>Ah, this is what you wanted.</i>

29:20.759 --> 29:23.421
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>You begged for it, bitch.</i>

29:24.095 --> 29:25.084
<i>[Dr. Merritt moans]</i>

29:25.630 --> 29:28.963
Would you describe
what we just heard
on the tape.

29:29.067 --> 29:31.501
I was on the table
in the examination room.

29:31.569 --> 29:33.434
Dr. Merritt's nurse,
Miss Gregg,

29:33.505 --> 29:36.338
prepared a syringe
and then left the room.

29:36.407 --> 29:38.068
He gave me an injection.

29:38.143 --> 29:41.579
Were you aware that drugs
were gonna be part
of this examination?

29:41.646 --> 29:43.045
He told me
it was a local.

29:43.114 --> 29:45.844
I've had minor surgery before
and that wasrt a local.

29:45.917 --> 29:47.248
It was some kind of sedative.

29:47.318 --> 29:48.444
Objection, Your Honor.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.578
Sustained.

29:49.654 --> 29:51.087
How did it make you feel?

29:51.589 --> 29:52.681
I couldn't move.

29:52.757 --> 29:54.088
Were you conscious?

29:54.159 --> 29:55.717
I saw everything he did.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.227
And what did he do?

29:57.295 --> 29:59.195
His eyes glazed over.

29:59.597 --> 30:01.827
I heard him unzip his pants.

30:02.567 --> 30:05.400
I tried to scream,
to push him away.
I couldn't.

30:05.470 --> 30:08.098
He was on top of me,
then inside me.

30:09.841 --> 30:11.638
No further questions.

30:15.413 --> 30:19.008
Miss Olivet.
Would you tell the court,
please,

30:19.117 --> 30:22.348
exactly what you did
after you left
Dr. Merritt's office?

30:22.420 --> 30:24.411
I called the police
and went to the hospital.

30:24.489 --> 30:25.956
You dialed 911?

30:26.024 --> 30:28.618
No. I called
Det. Michael Logan.

30:28.793 --> 30:30.021
But you were on 76th.

30:30.094 --> 30:32.619
Wouldrt it have been easier
to call the 19th Precinct?

30:32.697 --> 30:35.257
I have a personal relationship
with Det. Logan.

30:35.333 --> 30:38.530
You have more than that,
don't you, Miss Olivet?
You work with him.

30:38.603 --> 30:39.900
I've advised on...

30:39.971 --> 30:41.461
Oh, come on, come on.

30:41.539 --> 30:43.063
Every other Friday
your paycheck says

30:43.141 --> 30:45.336
New York City
Police Department.
Is that not true?

30:45.410 --> 30:46.502
Yes.

30:47.812 --> 30:51.441
Would you tell us, please,
who is Dr. Barbara Lawrence?

30:53.484 --> 30:54.473
Miss Olivet?

30:56.454 --> 30:57.819
She's my doctor.

30:57.889 --> 30:59.186
What kind of doctor?

31:00.058 --> 31:02.026
She's a gynecologist.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.123
(Melnick)
I see.

31:04.696 --> 31:08.029
And she's been treating you
for the last 12 years?

31:08.666 --> 31:09.690
Yes.

31:09.767 --> 31:12.634
And when was the last time
she examined you, please?

31:12.804 --> 31:13.964
Last September.

31:14.038 --> 31:18.236
Yet you saw Dr. Merritt
once in August
and two times in September.

31:18.343 --> 31:20.436
Do you see two dentists,
too, Miss Olivet?

31:20.511 --> 31:21.535
Objection.

31:21.613 --> 31:22.807
Sustained.

31:24.449 --> 31:26.474
How about Diane Perkins?

31:27.785 --> 31:29.252
You recognize that name?

31:29.320 --> 31:30.582
Relevance.

31:30.655 --> 31:32.850
Your Honor,
Diane Perkins is a patient

31:32.924 --> 31:34.949
of both Dr. Olivet
and Dr. Merritt's.

31:35.026 --> 31:38.223
The jury will disregard
Miss Melnick's statement

31:38.329 --> 31:40.854
and I'll see counsel
in chambers.

31:42.166 --> 31:44.498
I don't see
how it's relevant.

31:44.569 --> 31:47.367
It is when you guys
are out to play sting.

31:47.472 --> 31:49.906
Your Honor,
my client was entrapped.

31:50.008 --> 31:51.270
Explain, Miss Melnick.

31:51.342 --> 31:54.140
Six months ago, Miss Perkins
underwent a routine pelvic.

31:54.212 --> 31:57.306
Only, she freaked out.
She claimed that
Dr. Merritt molested her.

31:57.382 --> 32:00.317
In other words, your client
was predisposed
to sex crimes.

32:00.385 --> 32:01.511
This woman file charges?

32:01.586 --> 32:02.814
(Melnick)
Of course not.

32:02.887 --> 32:05.481
She thinks the guy
on the 6:00 news
is making eyes at her.

32:05.556 --> 32:08.423
This woman has deep rooted
psychological problems.

32:08.493 --> 32:11.519
So it's no surprise
that she's a regular
at Dr. Olivet's.

32:11.596 --> 32:14.861
But the problem is,
the therapist believed
the patient's fantasy.

32:14.933 --> 32:18.334
And now Dr. Olivet is out
to destroy a mars life.

32:19.270 --> 32:22.899
I'm sorry, Ben,
but the rantings
of one disturbed woman

32:23.007 --> 32:27.068
may be cause for suspicion,
but it in no way
establishes predisposition.

32:27.178 --> 32:29.510
You plan on putting
Miss Perkins on the stand?

32:29.580 --> 32:31.844
She won't waive
her doctor-patient privilege.

32:31.916 --> 32:33.577
Then no one else
will do it for her.

32:33.651 --> 32:34.845
There'll be
no further mention

32:34.919 --> 32:36.443
of Diane Perkins
in my courtroom.

32:37.021 --> 32:38.488
Count your blessings, Ben.

32:38.656 --> 32:41.454
If this were admissible,
we'd all be going home
right now.

32:43.061 --> 32:44.528
What the hell
is going on?

32:44.595 --> 32:46.460
I was raped.
That's all you needed to know.

32:46.531 --> 32:49.125
It would've helped to know
the alleged victim was lying.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.224
I never lied to you.

32:50.301 --> 32:53.065
The only reason
you went to Merritt
is for Diane Perkins.

32:53.137 --> 32:55.731
That has nothing to do
with me being
drugged and raped.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.741
It had a lot to do
with why you were raped.

32:57.809 --> 32:59.276
You want to know
why I went back?

32:59.410 --> 33:00.900
I sent Diane to Merritt.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.640
My gynecologist
wouldn't see her,

33:02.714 --> 33:04.306
and I bought
into his reputation.

33:04.382 --> 33:07.408
The awards, the articles.
I was responsible.

33:07.485 --> 33:10.511
But you did it the wrong way.
If you suspected
she was molested,

33:10.588 --> 33:12.021
you should have gone
to the police.

33:12.090 --> 33:14.081
With what?
She refused to come forward.

33:14.158 --> 33:17.150
I didn't know
whether to believe her.
She's been delusional

33:17.228 --> 33:20.664
and she certainly
couldn't have testified
against the esteemed doctor.

33:20.732 --> 33:22.393
She tried
to kill herself, Ben.

33:22.467 --> 33:25.402
You of all people
should know the importance
of full disclosure.

33:25.470 --> 33:26.596
You had a legal obligation.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.366
I had an obligation
to my patient.

33:28.439 --> 33:31.135
And in my profession,
that's all that counts.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.414
It happens.

33:38.483 --> 33:41.008
Especially with someone
like Dr. Merritt.

33:41.085 --> 33:44.350
I mean, women just fall
for their gynecologists.

33:44.455 --> 33:46.889
Was Miss Olivet
one of these women?

33:47.325 --> 33:48.519
I guess so.

33:48.593 --> 33:50.652
Miss Gregg,
describe for us exactly

33:50.728 --> 33:52.958
how Miss Olivet
acted toward Dr. Merritt.

33:53.264 --> 33:54.993
She got very personal.

33:55.066 --> 33:57.534
And isn't getting personal
part of the examination?

33:57.702 --> 34:00.364
No. It was different.
The way she talked.

34:00.438 --> 34:02.633
She was definitely
interested in more

34:02.707 --> 34:04.607
than an examination
from Dr. Merritt.

34:04.675 --> 34:05.733
Objection.

34:05.810 --> 34:06.902
(Judge Silver)
Sustained.

34:06.978 --> 34:08.775
No more questions.

34:10.214 --> 34:14.116
Miss Gregg, how long
have you worked
for Dr. Merritt?

34:15.053 --> 34:16.850
Almost three years.

34:16.954 --> 34:18.545
And what is
your annual salary?

34:18.989 --> 34:20.581
$40,000.

34:20.658 --> 34:22.181
Are you a registered nurse?

34:22.260 --> 34:23.318
No.

34:23.393 --> 34:24.860
And if Dr. Merritt
were convicted

34:24.929 --> 34:27.556
would you be making
that much money
with any other doctor?

34:27.632 --> 34:28.690
Objection.

34:28.766 --> 34:29.891
Withdrawn.

34:30.101 --> 34:32.569
Of course you didn't hear
the flirtations on the tape

34:32.637 --> 34:35.469
that occurred in my office,
prior to the examination.

34:35.572 --> 34:38.906
Was this the first time
she was friendly?

34:39.043 --> 34:43.036
Miss Olivet's dialogue
was suggestive
from the moment we met.

34:43.147 --> 34:45.672
As a matter of fact,
she called me
earlier in the day

34:45.750 --> 34:48.685
and it wasrt about
her scheduled appointment.

34:48.886 --> 34:51.821
I shouldn't have
made love to her.
I realize that.

34:51.889 --> 34:55.380
I regret it.
But there's no way in hell
that I raped her.

34:55.493 --> 34:57.256
Thank you, Doctor.

34:58.229 --> 35:01.665
Doctor, your nurse,
Miss Gregg, testified

35:02.867 --> 35:07.236
that many of your patients
become suggestive
with you, is that true?

35:08.039 --> 35:09.028
Yes.

35:09.107 --> 35:12.304
Was Dr. Olivet the only one
you ever had sex with?

35:12.510 --> 35:13.636
Objection. Relevance.

35:13.711 --> 35:16.475
Offered to show
defendant's predisposition,
Your Honor.

35:16.547 --> 35:19.539
The defendant
is predisposed to have sex.
He is a human being.

35:19.617 --> 35:22.313
The issue here
is whether he had
non-consensual sex.

35:22.386 --> 35:23.751
Sustained.

35:24.789 --> 35:27.451
Then tell me about
your second wife, Doctor.

35:27.558 --> 35:31.221
Specifically,
why she killed herself
wearing a leather hood.

35:31.295 --> 35:32.922
(Melnick)
Objection. Relevance.

35:33.030 --> 35:34.861
Your Honor,
the defendant tends

35:34.932 --> 35:36.866
towards aberrant
sexual practices.

35:36.934 --> 35:41.030
And this is offered
to show his predisposition
to criminal sexual behavior.

35:41.105 --> 35:42.436
Approach.

35:45.409 --> 35:48.207
Whatever my client
may have done
with consenting adults

35:48.279 --> 35:50.440
is not criminal
sexual behavior.

35:50.548 --> 35:53.449
The mars hobbies
are not relevant.

35:53.518 --> 35:55.918
Try it again,
and you're looking
at a mistrial.

35:57.722 --> 35:58.848
The objection is sustained.

35:58.923 --> 36:01.983
The jury will disregard
the preceding question.

36:07.465 --> 36:10.798
Dr. Olivet testified
that after the injection

36:10.902 --> 36:13.393
she was left immobile,
nearly unconscious.

36:13.471 --> 36:16.907
Is that a typical reaction
to an anesthetic, Doctor?

36:18.075 --> 36:20.441
Some people
have allergic reactions.

36:20.511 --> 36:23.036
I gave her a local.
A small dosage of lidocaine.

36:23.114 --> 36:24.445
It was for her own benefit.

36:24.515 --> 36:27.507
Do you usually anaesthetize
your partners
before sex, Doctor?

36:27.585 --> 36:28.643
Objection.

36:28.719 --> 36:29.743
Withdrawn.

36:30.421 --> 36:32.446
Do you call all
your women bitches, Doctor?

36:32.523 --> 36:33.512
Your Honor!

36:33.591 --> 36:35.388
Enough, Mr. Stone.

36:39.964 --> 36:41.955
Madam Forewoman,
have you reached a verdict?

36:42.033 --> 36:43.057
We have, Your Honor.

36:43.134 --> 36:44.624
On the sole count
of the indictment,

36:44.702 --> 36:46.602
Rape in the First Degree,
how do you find?

36:46.804 --> 36:48.897
We find the defendant guilty.

36:49.407 --> 36:51.466
[People applauding]

37:00.184 --> 37:01.481
Is this unanimous?

37:01.552 --> 37:02.883
It is, Your Honor.

37:03.321 --> 37:06.017
It is your job to listen
to all of the evidence,

37:06.090 --> 37:08.456
not pick and choose
at your whim.

37:09.293 --> 37:11.261
The evidence
clearly established

37:11.395 --> 37:13.386
that but for the actions
of the police,

37:13.464 --> 37:17.491
Dr. Merritt would never
have formed
the requisite criminal intent.

37:17.568 --> 37:19.934
And the State
utterly failed to demonstrate

37:20.004 --> 37:21.596
that the defendant
was predisposed

37:21.672 --> 37:22.798
to criminal behavior.

37:22.873 --> 37:23.931
Your Honor...

37:24.008 --> 37:25.236
When a respected doctor

37:25.309 --> 37:27.937
without any prior tendency
towards criminal behavior

37:28.012 --> 37:30.742
is induced,
and very possibly seduced,

37:30.815 --> 37:33.215
into committing a crime,
it's an outrage.

37:33.818 --> 37:35.479
I, for one,
will not ruin a mars life

37:35.553 --> 37:38.044
because the police
overstepped their bounds

37:38.556 --> 37:40.524
and a jury is too blinded
by graphic photos

37:40.591 --> 37:42.991
and emotional testimony
to see it.

37:43.828 --> 37:46.888
As such, I'm entering
a trial order of dismissal.

37:48.032 --> 37:49.226
[Laughing]

37:50.067 --> 37:51.534
[People chattering]

38:01.545 --> 38:03.638
He could just disregard
the jury's verdict?

38:03.714 --> 38:06.080
If he feels
the jury disregarded
the facts presented,

38:06.150 --> 38:07.208
yes, he can.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.344
Yup. We should've
seen it coming.

38:09.420 --> 38:13.982
Hon. Keith Silver
wrote the book
<i>On the Rights of the Accused.</i>

38:14.558 --> 38:17.789
He thinks Miranda
five pages too short.

38:17.895 --> 38:20.295
So Merritt
just walks away scot-free?

38:20.398 --> 38:21.660
Oh, there's got
to be others.

38:21.732 --> 38:23.222
What about
that Perkins woman?

38:23.301 --> 38:25.462
I can't imagine
what a trial would do to her.

38:25.536 --> 38:28.004
She's still unable to tell me
exactly what happened.

38:28.072 --> 38:29.835
What do we know
about that nurse?

38:29.907 --> 38:31.807
I know she lied
for him on the stand.

38:31.876 --> 38:34.037
Job's that good,
it's won'th jail time?

38:34.111 --> 38:35.772
You think he's got
something on her?

38:35.846 --> 38:37.211
I thought
you can't retry him.

38:37.281 --> 38:40.944
Not for what he did to you,
but we do know
the doctor has a history.

38:41.018 --> 38:42.918
Check out Nurse Gregg.

38:45.690 --> 38:49.558
Miriam Gregg.
It's no wonder she's attracted
to the medical profession.

38:49.627 --> 38:51.925
Two drug convictions,
using and selling,

38:51.996 --> 38:54.260
mostly prescription,
mostly Percodan.

38:54.365 --> 38:56.959
I'm sure Dr. Merritt
has an unlimited supply
of that.

38:57.034 --> 38:59.127
So he bought her help
and protection.

38:59.203 --> 39:01.103
She prepared the syringe.

39:01.172 --> 39:03.834
She knows it was a sedative
not an anesthetic.

39:03.908 --> 39:07.400
Unfortunately, the drug scan
can't confirm anything.

39:07.478 --> 39:09.571
Well, maybe Nurse Gregg
is not up-to-date

39:09.647 --> 39:11.808
on the latest
in forensic science.

39:13.718 --> 39:15.879
You're accusing me
of rape?

39:15.953 --> 39:19.445
Gee, sorry, fellows,
but I like my sex
the old-fashioned way.

39:19.557 --> 39:21.047
No, I'm sorry,
Miss Gregg.

39:21.125 --> 39:24.060
You prepared the syringe
and it wasrt an anesthetic.

39:24.128 --> 39:26.119
Makes you an accomplice.

39:26.230 --> 39:27.959
You can't prove anything.

39:28.065 --> 39:30.260
Science is a wonderful thing,
Miss Gregg.

39:30.334 --> 39:33.167
FBI tells us that the new
gas chromatography tests

39:33.237 --> 39:35.967
can prove that it was
a sedative in the syringe.

39:37.108 --> 39:40.509
The good news is that
your Percodan supply's
dried up.

39:40.611 --> 39:42.875
Better news is that
we have enough evidence

39:42.947 --> 39:45.177
to prosecute you
for Rape One.

39:49.620 --> 39:53.112
You mean he gets his jollies,
and I have to go to jail?

39:53.190 --> 39:54.623
For at least 25 years.

39:54.692 --> 39:57.490
We're not talking
about only one count.

39:58.863 --> 40:03.357
But, wait a minute.
That Perkins woman,
he did that on his own.

40:11.041 --> 40:13.134
If I was raped
why don't I remember?

40:13.210 --> 40:15.371
You know, I think
I'd remember being raped.

40:16.046 --> 40:18.344
I wanted to shut it out, too.

40:18.849 --> 40:21.374
Just act like
it was a bad dream.

40:27.825 --> 40:29.884
It won't go away, Diane.

40:32.296 --> 40:34.560
I think it was someone else.

40:35.299 --> 40:37.199
I don't think
it happened to me.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.667
I know.

40:40.738 --> 40:43.070
I felt like
it was someone else, too.

40:44.108 --> 40:45.905
Like I didn't exist.

40:53.584 --> 40:54.573
I...

40:55.920 --> 40:58.218
I had these terrible cramps.

40:59.390 --> 41:01.221
What kind of cramps?

41:02.526 --> 41:04.050
I don't know.

41:07.998 --> 41:12.094
He was sweating,
and all I could think of was:

41:13.070 --> 41:17.666
It's not hot in here.
Why is he sweating?

41:20.878 --> 41:23.142
My feet were in the stirrups.

41:23.214 --> 41:25.444
L... I tried to get away
but l... I couldn't.

41:28.419 --> 41:30.444
He just left me there

41:33.390 --> 41:35.517
with my legs up.

41:37.161 --> 41:38.685
[Crying]

41:39.563 --> 41:42.123
He didn't say anything.

41:43.934 --> 41:47.370
He just snapped off
his gloves.

41:48.072 --> 41:52.941
He threw them away,
and he walked out.

41:55.379 --> 42:00.316
He left me there
like I was
a piece of garbage.

42:04.421 --> 42:06.548
It wasrt your fault, Diane.

42:16.233 --> 42:17.097
She remembers,

42:17.167 --> 42:19.727
but putting her
on the stand
would be disastrous for her.

42:19.803 --> 42:21.270
With the nurse
to corroborate,

42:21.338 --> 42:22.828
all she has to do
is say it happened.

42:22.907 --> 42:24.772
(Olivet)
Merritt's lawyer
will destroy her.

42:24.842 --> 42:27.436
She thinks
she's responsible.
She thinks she seduced him.

42:27.511 --> 42:28.569
That's ridiculous.

42:28.646 --> 42:29.635
It's typical.

42:29.713 --> 42:32.181
Without her testimony, Liz,
we can't prosecute.

42:32.316 --> 42:35.774
After he raped me,
he just smiled
and left the room.

42:35.853 --> 42:38.651
After the acquittal
he had that same damn smile.

42:38.756 --> 42:41.623
It was like he was bragging
to everyone in the room.

42:41.692 --> 42:43.421
"I did it
and I got away with it

42:43.494 --> 42:45.621
and there's nothing
anyone can do."

42:46.163 --> 42:48.256
You mean,
bragging is part of this?

42:48.332 --> 42:51.130
It's what makes
his conquest complete.

42:53.871 --> 42:57.307
Call Cerreta and Logan,
and have Dr. Merritt arrested.

42:57.374 --> 42:58.705
Ben, I told you...

42:58.776 --> 43:00.334
(Stone)
Diane won't have to testify.

43:00.678 --> 43:03.272
And make sure
that the local news knows

43:03.347 --> 43:05.406
when Merritt
will be arraigned.

43:05.983 --> 43:07.473
[Reporters chattering]

43:08.686 --> 43:11.052
Do you think you'll be
successful this time?

43:11.121 --> 43:13.453
I don't go forward
unless I think I have a case.

43:13.524 --> 43:15.355
Yeah, but is it
a good case?

43:15.459 --> 43:16.653
What's the problem?

43:16.727 --> 43:19.161
Dr. Merritt's guilty.
Why has it been so difficult

43:19.229 --> 43:21.220
to successfully
prosecute him?

43:21.298 --> 43:23.061
It's the same
with most rape cases.

43:23.200 --> 43:24.997
Even more so
when doctors are involved.

43:25.069 --> 43:27.367
The victims feel disgraced.
They feel guilty

43:27.438 --> 43:29.668
and they're ashamed
to come forward.

43:29.740 --> 43:31.139
(reporter <i>#</i> 1)
There's Dr. Merritt.

43:31.208 --> 43:32.470
Excuse me.

43:32.543 --> 43:35.376
(reporter <i>#</i> 2)
Doctor, will you be exonerated
of all charges?

43:36.146 --> 43:38.307
(reporter <i>#</i> 3)
Could we get
a statement please?

43:38.382 --> 43:40.316
<i>I assure you,</i>
<i>I've done nothing wrong.</i>

43:40.384 --> 43:42.284
<i>I treat women,</i>
<i>I don't rape them.</i>

43:42.353 --> 43:44.412
<i>Women respect me.</i>
<i>It's been my success.</i>

43:44.488 --> 43:47.582
<i>Look, this is</i>
<i>a vendetta by the DA's office,</i>
<i>pure and simple.</i>

43:47.658 --> 43:50.286
<i>This case</i>
<i>will never get to trial.</i>

43:50.761 --> 43:52.319
Arrogant SOB.

43:52.396 --> 43:54.364
He can afford it.
He's one for one.

43:54.431 --> 43:57.764
You telling the world
that we don't have a case
only feeds his ego.

43:57.835 --> 43:58.859
We're working on it, Adam.

43:58.936 --> 43:59.925
We'll have a case.

44:00.004 --> 44:01.437
I hope to hell we do.

44:01.505 --> 44:05.339
Or we'll all be dancing
in front of
the disciplinary committee.

44:06.076 --> 44:07.543
I hope this works.

44:07.611 --> 44:10.603
A lot of people watch
the 6:00 news, Paul.

44:15.586 --> 44:16.678
You pursue this, Ben,

44:16.754 --> 44:18.278
I'm going to
the appellate division.

44:18.355 --> 44:19.583
Retaliatory prosecution.

44:19.657 --> 44:22.091
If you are lucky, my dear,
you will just get disbarred.

44:22.159 --> 44:23.285
You do what
you have to do.

44:23.360 --> 44:25.328
(Melnick)
You've been humiliated
in court once,

44:25.396 --> 44:27.023
and that was with
a Ph.D. On the stand.

44:27.097 --> 44:29.964
Can you imagine what happens
with a psychopath
and a drug addict?

44:30.034 --> 44:32.867
Please, Ben,
drop the charges
against Dr. Merritt.

44:33.237 --> 44:35.330
Consider saving
your own career.

44:35.406 --> 44:37.897
When I was a boy
I collected baseball cards.

44:37.975 --> 44:39.169
And there was this one kid

44:39.243 --> 44:43.236
who convinced me
to trade a Duke Snider
for a Gene Hermanski.

44:43.781 --> 44:45.373
He said it was a good deal.

44:45.449 --> 44:46.882
What the hell
does that mean?

44:46.950 --> 44:48.349
(Stone)
I learned the hard way.

44:48.419 --> 44:51.217
For a deal to be good,
there has to be
equal consideration.

44:51.288 --> 44:54.257
And there's no way
you can cough up
enough consideration

44:54.324 --> 44:55.655
to justify a deal for him.

44:56.293 --> 44:57.658
Why?

44:59.730 --> 45:03.325
Fifty-four women
you either raped,
molested, or abused.

45:10.307 --> 45:12.867
In the future, sir,
stay off the evening news.

45:20.250 --> 45:21.547
[Sighing]

45:27.424 --> 45:30.018
Okay, Ben,
what do you want?

45:31.762 --> 45:34.287
In a perfect world,
I'd like to see your client

45:34.364 --> 45:37.492
locked in a room for a week
with these women.

45:38.302 --> 45:39.599
But I'll settle
for seeing him

45:39.670 --> 45:41.729
spend the rest
of his life in jail.

45:56.754 --> 45:58.312
I'm faking it.

46:01.492 --> 46:02.982
Faking what?

46:06.597 --> 46:10.158
I was halfway
through a session this morning
with this woman

46:10.267 --> 46:13.168
when I realized
I hadrt been listening.

46:15.205 --> 46:17.537
I hadrt heard what she said.

46:19.810 --> 46:21.209
It happens.

46:26.216 --> 46:28.150
Doesrt happen to me.

46:34.224 --> 46:35.657
It'll pass.

46:42.499 --> 46:43.830
Will it?
