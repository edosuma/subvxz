01:10.075 --> 01:13.342
Adam's desire
shall be the husband,

01:13.376 --> 01:16.542
and he shall rule over me.

01:16.576 --> 01:21.142
If she obeys,
she shall be surely punished.

01:23.309 --> 01:26.109
No. No!

01:48.509 --> 01:51.042
We've got one body,
female, late thirties,

01:51.075 --> 01:52.409
found in the trunk of this car.

01:52.442 --> 01:55.042
Cause of death unknown.

01:55.075 --> 01:56.242
Who found the body?

01:56.276 --> 01:59.209
Ugh, Norma Ellis is her name.

01:59.242 --> 02:00.875
- How old is she?
- I don't know,

02:00.908 --> 02:02.942
maybe late twenties.

02:02.975 --> 02:06.209
- What's she doing here?
- Said she was on a walk.

02:06.242 --> 02:09.408
- A walk? Here?
- Yeah.

02:09.442 --> 02:11.409
Yeah? She got an alibi?

02:11.442 --> 02:13.842
Alibi? She called us.

02:13.875 --> 02:18.109
Eh, sometimes a killer will
insinuate himself or herself

02:18.142 --> 02:19.342
into the crime,

02:19.376 --> 02:21.142
even reporting
the crime themself.

02:21.175 --> 02:23.276
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:23.309 --> 02:26.042
Yeah, I don't think
that's the case here.

02:26.075 --> 02:28.009
- Can I talk to her?
- You want to talk to her?

02:28.042 --> 02:30.908
- Yeah.
- I just sent her away.

02:30.942 --> 02:32.242
- Why?
- Just thought

02:32.276 --> 02:33.842
I'd get a statement
and then she can leave.

02:33.875 --> 02:35.509
I mean, you have the report,
you can read it.

02:35.542 --> 02:36.509
No, I don't want
to read the report.

02:36.542 --> 02:38.042
I need to talk to her.

02:38.075 --> 02:40.509
- Can you go find her?
- Yeah, I got you.

02:57.209 --> 02:59.875
How long has she been here?

02:59.908 --> 03:01.309
Judging from the decomposition,

03:01.342 --> 03:04.908
- I'd say just over a month.
- Only a month?

03:04.942 --> 03:06.942
Yeah, well, bodies,
they decompose faster

03:06.975 --> 03:08.242
in a hotter,
more humid climate,

03:08.276 --> 03:11.808
so a month, yeah,
it could look like it, yeah.

03:13.276 --> 03:16.409
- Any identification?
- No. Nothing on her.

03:16.442 --> 03:18.342
That's okay.

03:18.376 --> 03:20.075
All right, thanks, Sharon.

03:43.376 --> 03:45.409
So...

03:45.442 --> 03:48.409
What were you doing here?

03:48.442 --> 03:51.109
I was just taking a walk
and I ended up here.

03:51.142 --> 03:52.376
A walk.

03:52.409 --> 03:53.942
So late at night?

03:53.975 --> 03:55.309
Yes, sir.

03:55.342 --> 03:58.109
I stay up late.
Is that a crime?

04:01.975 --> 04:05.209
Where were you coming from?

04:05.242 --> 04:07.142
That's an awful long walk
out here.

04:07.175 --> 04:08.875
I'm just trying to figure out
where you were coming from.

04:08.908 --> 04:10.975
I don't know. Somewhere.

04:11.009 --> 04:12.576
- You see anybody?
- No, sir.

04:12.609 --> 04:15.042
- Did you hear anything?
- No, sir.

04:21.242 --> 04:23.808
How long you been using?

04:26.409 --> 04:30.042
Don't worry, I'm homicide,
I don't do narcotics.

04:32.109 --> 04:33.808
Year and a half.

04:33.842 --> 04:35.476
Heroin?

04:39.276 --> 04:41.476
You got a place?

04:43.242 --> 04:45.109
Uh...

04:45.142 --> 04:49.276
I have a friend who lets me
sleep on his couch.

04:51.576 --> 04:53.175
Listen, look, I could have
one of our officers

04:53.209 --> 04:55.376
take you over to a hotel
where you can shower,

04:55.409 --> 04:58.775
you can eat, have a nice sleep.

05:00.242 --> 05:02.009
Would you like that?

05:03.842 --> 05:04.875
Yes, sir.

05:06.875 --> 05:08.409
Okay.

05:13.042 --> 05:15.808
The victim was
an adult female, 5'5,

05:15.842 --> 05:20.175
about 115 to 120 pounds
at the time of death.

05:20.209 --> 05:23.309
Cause of death
was asphyxiation.

05:25.342 --> 05:28.576
- DNA?
- Not yet.

05:28.609 --> 05:31.409
It'll take at least two weeks
for mapping.

05:31.442 --> 05:32.942
Then, we'll be able
to compare it

05:32.975 --> 05:34.476
against the federal database.

05:36.342 --> 05:38.276
Fingerprints?

05:38.309 --> 05:39.476
No. Nothing.

05:39.509 --> 05:41.242
She was all cleaned up.

05:43.342 --> 05:46.376
- Rape?
- Yes, there is evidence

05:46.409 --> 05:49.342
of both vaginal
and anal intercourse.

05:50.875 --> 05:52.842
- Anything on the car?
- No.

05:52.875 --> 05:55.875
That was also all cleaned up.

05:55.908 --> 05:58.442
So you're telling me
we've got nothing.

06:01.975 --> 06:05.509
Tortured, abused,
and discarded.

06:08.042 --> 06:09.908
What do you have?

06:09.942 --> 06:12.109
Well, right now,
I'm going through

06:12.142 --> 06:15.542
unsolved missing persons cases
from the county.

06:15.576 --> 06:19.209
Some of these, they go
as far back as a decade.

06:21.109 --> 06:24.075
You don't think it could be
somebody local, do you?

06:26.975 --> 06:29.109
It's possible.

06:31.875 --> 06:34.842
No, it's got to be a drifter.

06:37.009 --> 06:39.175
Where are we on time?

06:39.209 --> 06:42.576
Well, takes two weeks
to process.

06:42.609 --> 06:45.142
But we could save some time
if we cross-reference the DNA

06:45.175 --> 06:46.576
with the missing girls.

06:59.209 --> 07:02.975
I received it a few weeks
after she went missing...

07:03.009 --> 07:05.376
telling me
not to look for her.

07:05.409 --> 07:08.476
I told the police,
but they just didn't care.

07:08.509 --> 07:11.109
I don't know,
it seemed normal to them.

07:12.542 --> 07:15.576
And then I saw the news.

07:15.609 --> 07:18.509
That's why I called.

07:18.542 --> 07:20.975
That girl you found
down by the scrapyard...

07:22.908 --> 07:24.975
Is it Jennifer?

07:25.009 --> 07:26.775
We don't know yet.

07:28.242 --> 07:30.842
And you're sure
that this is from her?

07:30.875 --> 07:32.908
I know my sister's handwriting.

07:32.942 --> 07:35.509
She wrote that.

07:35.542 --> 07:39.808
But what that said,
it never made sense to me.

07:39.842 --> 07:43.042
- Why?
- She used her middle name, Liza,

07:43.075 --> 07:44.342
which she hated.

07:44.376 --> 07:45.842
I mean, she never wanted
to be called anything

07:45.875 --> 07:48.309
but Jennifer Collins.

07:51.009 --> 07:53.808
She was such a beautiful child.

07:56.509 --> 07:58.309
Tell me about her.

08:00.142 --> 08:02.842
She dreamed of living
in this big house, you know,

08:02.875 --> 08:05.875
with the perfect husband
bullshit,

08:05.908 --> 08:09.242
wearing fancy clothes
and raising her children.

08:11.109 --> 08:14.376
She used to talk about having
a big family all the time

08:14.409 --> 08:16.209
and how she would
keep the house clean

08:16.242 --> 08:18.442
and make dinner.

08:20.342 --> 08:22.242
The American dream.

08:23.975 --> 08:26.942
That's what we all want, right?

08:43.609 --> 08:45.209
Hey, I'm calling
to let you know

08:45.242 --> 08:48.509
we just got the analysis back
on the DNA test.

08:48.542 --> 08:51.409
The conclusion
is 99.9% confident

08:51.442 --> 08:53.209
it's the body of Linda Bridges,

08:53.242 --> 08:55.808
the missing girl
from our database.

08:55.842 --> 08:57.376
I left the report on your desk.

09:58.109 --> 10:00.209
Ms. Bridges,
when did you receive this?

10:00.242 --> 10:03.808
A few months
after Linda disappeared.

10:03.842 --> 10:08.576
First, we thought she'd just
run away and she'd come back.

10:08.609 --> 10:13.442
Then, we started thinking
something was not right.

10:13.476 --> 10:16.109
- And is this her handwriting?
- Yes.

10:16.142 --> 10:18.576
- You sure about that?
- Mm-hm.

10:24.042 --> 10:25.875
Okay, this is our focus.

10:25.908 --> 10:27.376
Not the crime scene,

10:27.409 --> 10:29.509
not the corpse,
not the schematics.

10:29.542 --> 10:33.209
We focus on Linda and Jennifer.

10:33.242 --> 10:35.175
Now they both got the same MO.

10:35.209 --> 10:38.276
They vanish,
then they send a postcard.

10:38.309 --> 10:40.009
That's our crucial detail.

10:40.042 --> 10:41.875
Now, our methodology tells me

10:41.908 --> 10:43.509
that we're looking
for a white male.

10:43.542 --> 10:46.109
These sort of crimes,
they rarely cross racial lines.

10:46.142 --> 10:48.342
Now he's probably
right around their age,

10:48.376 --> 10:51.209
he's probably a loner,
uneducated...

10:52.609 --> 10:55.276
...and most likely,
he's a local.

10:58.209 --> 10:59.908
What makes you say that?

10:59.942 --> 11:01.476
This was personal.

11:01.509 --> 11:03.009
Now, the coroner's report shows

11:03.042 --> 11:04.808
that Linda was beaten
repeatedly, raped,

11:04.842 --> 11:06.842
and then murdered.

11:06.875 --> 11:09.942
That's not random,
but I think it's best

11:09.975 --> 11:11.009
that we start
interviewing locals

11:11.042 --> 11:13.175
before we branch out.

11:13.209 --> 11:17.276
Does modern society convey this
as being acceptable?

11:22.842 --> 11:25.142
Do you find her attractive?

11:27.276 --> 11:29.276
Ej....

11:29.309 --> 11:31.042
would you want this woman?

11:31.075 --> 11:33.442
What?

11:33.476 --> 11:36.808
Would you sleep
with that woman?

11:36.842 --> 11:38.109
I don't understand.

11:38.142 --> 11:41.209
Would you make love
to this woman?

11:41.242 --> 11:44.309
- No, I wouldn't.
- No, why not?

11:44.342 --> 11:46.175
Not becoming enough?

11:46.209 --> 11:49.042
Well, it's just...

11:49.075 --> 11:50.442
Okay.

11:50.476 --> 11:53.075
But you would sleep
with Miss America?

11:53.109 --> 11:55.476
Yeah, of course
I'd sleep with her.

11:55.509 --> 11:56.875
Exactly.

11:56.908 --> 11:59.409
After all, she's Miss America.

12:01.276 --> 12:03.142
We don't even need to see
Miss America,

12:03.175 --> 12:05.542
but we know
that we would run home

12:05.576 --> 12:07.509
and we would bang her
if we could.

12:09.276 --> 12:13.209
Okay, but this woman
who is so unattractive to you

12:13.242 --> 12:17.509
is actually
Miss Mary Katherine Campbell,

12:17.542 --> 12:22.476
Miss Ohio,
the first Miss America.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.509
And you, Ej, you seem to be

12:24.542 --> 12:28.075
a blatant contradiction
to yourself.

12:28.109 --> 12:30.975
Okay, so the assignment is...

12:32.908 --> 12:34.875
How has society evolved

12:34.908 --> 12:38.409
in terms of beauty standards,

12:38.442 --> 12:41.175
and why?

13:53.309 --> 13:54.908
Why so quiet?

13:57.975 --> 14:00.242
I'm thinking.

14:04.075 --> 14:05.509
About what?

14:09.276 --> 14:12.142
I'm bringing in a new girl.

14:17.476 --> 14:19.342
Are you sure about this?

14:21.009 --> 14:23.042
I am.

14:25.075 --> 14:26.975
I mean, even after
what happened last time?

14:27.009 --> 14:30.042
This time will be different.

14:30.075 --> 14:31.542
How do you know?

14:31.576 --> 14:34.509
I know it'll be different.

14:37.442 --> 14:38.476
Look, I don't think
this is a good idea.

14:38.509 --> 14:42.409
Why are you speaking
like you have something to say?

14:42.442 --> 14:45.808
I am telling you this time
it'll be different.

14:56.842 --> 14:59.808
- Sorry, we're closed.
- Hailey...

15:01.242 --> 15:02.975
I didn't know you worked here.

15:03.009 --> 15:05.509
Yes. Yes, I do.

15:05.542 --> 15:07.175
What can I help you with?

15:07.209 --> 15:09.009
I'm looking for something
for my wife.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.908
Oh, what size does she wear?

15:11.942 --> 15:14.542
About your size.

15:14.576 --> 15:17.576
Mm-hm. That looks a little...

15:17.609 --> 15:20.109
That looks more
like your style.

15:20.142 --> 15:23.242
- Shit.
- What?

15:23.276 --> 15:25.808
- The time.
- What time is it?

15:25.842 --> 15:28.975
The store is closed,
and I lost my ride.

15:29.009 --> 15:30.808
Oh.

15:30.842 --> 15:32.576
I could give you a ride.

15:32.609 --> 15:35.942
Oh, no, no, it's okay,
I can just take a cab.

15:35.975 --> 15:38.808
Oh, no, it's the least
I can do.

15:38.842 --> 15:41.542
It's my fault.

15:41.576 --> 15:44.908
Okay, yeah, I would like that.

15:49.109 --> 15:53.376
Okay, well, this is me.

15:54.609 --> 15:57.409
Is it okay
if I use your bathroom?

16:00.242 --> 16:02.476
Sure.

16:11.309 --> 16:13.842
It's just down the hall.

16:41.409 --> 16:44.175
Well, I better get going.

16:44.209 --> 16:47.342
- Thank you.
- Sure, no problem.

16:55.309 --> 16:58.376
- Goodnight, Hailey.
- Goodnight.

17:37.009 --> 17:38.309
Yes?

17:38.342 --> 17:41.009
I left my keys in the bathroom.

17:54.476 --> 17:56.209
Oh, no! Ah!

17:56.242 --> 17:58.342
Someone help me!

17:58.376 --> 18:00.808
Help me!

18:03.342 --> 18:04.309
Oh, no!

19:46.908 --> 19:48.842
Am I next?

19:50.542 --> 19:52.576
Okay.

19:52.609 --> 19:56.276
Hi, my name is Hawk,
I'm codependent.

19:56.309 --> 19:59.175
I have been my whole life.

20:00.975 --> 20:02.875
I grew up with a single mother
and a younger sister

20:02.908 --> 20:04.908
outside Boston.

20:04.942 --> 20:07.009
My mother was an addict

20:07.042 --> 20:10.342
in every sense of the word.

20:10.376 --> 20:14.042
She drinks, she smokes,

20:14.075 --> 20:19.075
she does drugs,
she lies, she steals.

20:20.542 --> 20:24.442
I've never had
a sip of alcohol or smoked.

20:25.975 --> 20:27.209
I used to see
the way my mother was

20:27.242 --> 20:31.042
and I never wanted to be
anything like her.

20:33.175 --> 20:35.842
But I guess it's inevitable,
though.

20:35.875 --> 20:37.476
I did one thing like her.

20:37.509 --> 20:40.975
I got divorced three years ago.

20:41.009 --> 20:42.542
Cop with a broken marriage,
I'm sure you guys all heard

20:42.576 --> 20:45.042
that one before, right?

20:47.209 --> 20:49.376
So after my marriage,
I packed up my stuff

20:49.409 --> 20:51.476
and I moved down here
to be close with my mom.

20:56.842 --> 20:59.576
Have a sister.

20:59.609 --> 21:01.376
Also an addict.

21:02.942 --> 21:04.309
Heroin.

21:07.276 --> 21:09.075
And what started as pills
for back pain

21:09.109 --> 21:13.175
ended up in a $200-a-day habit.

21:14.975 --> 21:18.908
What's sad is, I, uh,
I always gave her the money.

21:21.242 --> 21:24.009
No matter how bad the lie.

21:31.409 --> 21:33.442
She died in my arms

21:33.476 --> 21:34.908
in a washed-out hotel room

21:34.942 --> 21:37.975
with the needle
still in her arm.

21:40.576 --> 21:42.342
And every day
my mother calls me,

21:42.376 --> 21:44.808
asks me when I'll find her.

21:47.342 --> 21:50.075
I don't have the heart to...

21:50.109 --> 21:52.875
to let her know
that she's gone.

21:55.142 --> 21:58.242
Instead, I just play along.

22:00.942 --> 22:02.576
I just, uh...

22:04.042 --> 22:06.942
I tell her, "I'll find her."

24:58.476 --> 25:01.376
No! Stop! Ahh!

25:01.409 --> 25:03.075
Oh, no!

25:03.109 --> 25:05.209
Someone help me!

25:05.242 --> 25:07.242
Help me!

27:05.009 --> 27:06.442
If you see any of 'em,
give me a call, okay?

27:06.476 --> 27:08.142
The number is right on there,
all right?

27:08.175 --> 27:09.808
Thank you.

27:26.042 --> 27:27.509
Thank you.

30:32.009 --> 30:34.109
What do you think?

30:34.142 --> 30:36.009
It's not for you.

30:38.209 --> 30:39.808
Then for who?

30:41.242 --> 30:43.075
You know who.

30:45.276 --> 30:47.542
Well, does she have a name?

30:51.075 --> 30:53.175
Her name is Hailey.

33:09.242 --> 33:11.908
He wants you to wear this.

33:20.309 --> 33:23.209
And don't even think
about escaping.

33:23.242 --> 33:25.309
He's watching us.

33:32.309 --> 33:35.009
How long have you been here?

33:39.109 --> 33:42.075
Like, five years.

33:42.109 --> 33:44.975
Five years?

33:45.009 --> 33:48.209
Why is he doing this?

33:48.242 --> 33:50.009
He wants to...

33:51.509 --> 33:54.276
...find something
much more profound.

33:54.309 --> 33:57.309
He wants to change us,
make us better,

33:57.342 --> 34:00.209
make us live up
to our full potentials.

34:01.609 --> 34:03.509
By kidnapping us?

34:03.542 --> 34:06.075
No, it's much more complicated
than that.

34:06.109 --> 34:07.476
Men are never complicated.

34:07.509 --> 34:10.908
Well, you've never met
somebody like him.

34:20.275 --> 34:23.141
Okay, you're gonna need
to learn how to do this.

34:23.175 --> 34:25.808
He wants your makeup
a certain way.

34:28.275 --> 34:30.342
Take a look.

34:32.376 --> 34:34.942
Okay, so he wants us
really tan,

34:34.975 --> 34:36.376
so I have to put this on,
like, once a week,

34:36.409 --> 34:40.275
but you might want this,
like, every other day.

34:42.476 --> 34:43.975
He wants our teeth
to be really white,

34:44.009 --> 34:46.309
so you have to wear this
three times a day.

34:46.342 --> 34:49.042
Oh! It burns.

34:50.442 --> 34:52.476
Ugh.

34:52.509 --> 34:55.175
This is my side,
and that's your side.

34:55.208 --> 34:56.842
And that's final.

34:58.242 --> 35:01.009
We have a certain dress code
that we wear.

35:01.042 --> 35:03.209
Sometimes, it'll be
the same dress for weeks

35:03.242 --> 35:05.009
and then, out of the blue,

35:05.042 --> 35:06.576
it'll be something
totally different,

35:06.609 --> 35:11.276
but whatever it is,
we just follow along.

35:53.075 --> 35:55.875
Help! Help!

35:55.908 --> 35:58.442
Somebody help me, please,
somebody help me!

35:58.476 --> 36:01.175
Stop! Stop! Stop.

36:01.209 --> 36:02.309
You have to stop.

36:02.342 --> 36:03.509
You're gonna get us
both killed.

36:03.542 --> 36:04.576
I don't care.

36:04.609 --> 36:07.075
It's better than spending
the rest of my life

36:07.109 --> 36:08.842
in this place.

36:08.875 --> 36:11.309
You ungrateful little bitch!

36:15.175 --> 36:17.476
You don't get it, do you?

36:17.509 --> 36:19.808
You think this is easy?

36:19.842 --> 36:22.309
Well, before you,
there was Linda,

36:22.342 --> 36:24.309
and before Linda
there was Carla,

36:24.342 --> 36:27.509
and before her,
we had Samantha.

36:27.542 --> 36:30.476
But now they're all dead,
probably rotting somewhere

36:30.509 --> 36:34.342
because they couldn't
follow the rules.

36:34.376 --> 36:37.109
I'm still here
because I followed the rules,

36:37.142 --> 36:39.476
and the rules are
that I have to take care of you

36:39.509 --> 36:42.542
and that is what I'm gonna do.

36:42.576 --> 36:45.309
So get used to it.

37:00.576 --> 37:02.476
You have reached
the National Center

37:02.509 --> 37:04.908
for Missing
and Exploited Children.

37:04.942 --> 37:06.942
This line is being recorded.

37:06.975 --> 37:08.376
By continuing your call,

37:08.409 --> 37:10.842
you acknowledge your consent
to the recording.

37:10.875 --> 37:12.509
If you do not wish
to be recorded,

37:12.542 --> 37:14.109
please hang up now.

37:14.142 --> 37:15.476
Hi, this is Robbie Coleman.

37:15.509 --> 37:18.409
I'm returning your call
about my daughter, Hailey.

37:18.442 --> 37:20.376
She's been missing
for seven months now,

37:20.409 --> 37:23.542
but the odd thing is,
is that we just received

37:23.576 --> 37:26.576
a postcard from her
a few weeks ago.

37:26.609 --> 37:28.109
Like I told the officers,

37:28.142 --> 37:31.309
something just doesn't
seem right.

37:31.342 --> 37:33.075
Well, she sent me a postcard.

37:33.109 --> 37:35.209
Uh...

37:35.242 --> 37:36.109
She told me she was okay

37:36.142 --> 37:39.309
and that I should stop
looking for her.

37:39.342 --> 37:41.075
It came from New York.

37:41.109 --> 37:42.276
New York?

37:42.309 --> 37:44.075
Okay.

37:44.109 --> 37:45.376
And when?

37:45.409 --> 37:48.209
About ten weeks ago maybe.

37:48.242 --> 37:50.109
And since?

37:50.142 --> 37:52.276
Nothing.

37:52.309 --> 37:54.276
She's a good girl.

37:54.309 --> 37:56.875
She's great.

37:56.908 --> 37:58.542
Very open.

37:58.576 --> 38:01.075
Always the center
of attention,

38:01.109 --> 38:03.509
and she loves it.

38:03.542 --> 38:06.542
- She's kind and she's smart.
- Okay.

38:06.576 --> 38:09.042
Any drug use or any boyfriends
I should be aware of?

38:09.075 --> 38:11.476
No, no. No drugs,
no boyfriends,

38:11.509 --> 38:14.476
nothing like that,
she's... she's a good girl.

38:15.842 --> 38:18.075
Tell me about her.

38:18.109 --> 38:20.142
She was Hailey.

38:20.175 --> 38:21.908
Okay, what does that mean?

38:21.942 --> 38:24.942
She did what she felt like
when she felt like doing it.

38:24.975 --> 38:27.842
Nobody said a word,
everybody loved her.

38:27.875 --> 38:30.209
Well, did she... did she
give you any indication

38:30.242 --> 38:31.942
of where she was going

38:31.975 --> 38:34.975
or say anything at all
about leaving?

38:35.009 --> 38:37.509
Other than this shit town? Nah.

38:37.542 --> 38:40.175
She just went about her day
being herself.

38:40.209 --> 38:42.409
Miss Hailey Coleman.

38:44.042 --> 38:47.109
- Family?
- Yeah.

38:47.142 --> 38:48.042
They were tight.

38:48.075 --> 38:49.476
She had a good home.

38:49.509 --> 38:51.476
Maybe even too good.

38:51.509 --> 38:53.409
Now you two, you guys
were best friends?

38:53.442 --> 38:56.342
Hm, something like that.

38:56.376 --> 38:59.409
Okay. What about any drugs?

39:01.042 --> 39:03.209
Oh, yeah, she did everything,

39:03.242 --> 39:07.808
coke, oxy, speed,
ecstasy, weed.

39:07.842 --> 39:09.175
Name it.

39:09.209 --> 39:12.109
She partied hard.

39:12.142 --> 39:14.476
Boyfriends?

39:17.142 --> 39:19.209
What does that mean?

39:19.242 --> 39:21.342
We fucked around a lot.

39:21.376 --> 39:24.542
Well, any probation still
must begin in the house,

39:24.576 --> 39:28.542
and we have to have all
the information to act upon.

39:28.576 --> 39:31.509
So the fact that they said...

39:31.542 --> 39:33.009
Hi, how can I help you?

39:33.042 --> 39:34.309
Hi, I'm here investigating

39:34.342 --> 39:35.875
the disappearance of a student.

39:35.908 --> 39:37.476
Her name is Hailey Coleman.

39:37.509 --> 39:39.875
What information
are you looking for?

39:39.908 --> 39:42.075
Her class schedule,
professors, the works,

39:42.109 --> 39:43.175
whatever you can give me.

39:43.209 --> 39:45.409
Okay.

39:45.442 --> 39:47.075
And if you have it,
I'm gonna need the information

39:47.109 --> 39:50.042
for Jennifer Collins
and Linda Bridges as well.

39:52.975 --> 39:55.442
First, we thought
she'd just run away...

39:55.476 --> 39:56.942
I received it a few weeks
after she went missing.

39:56.975 --> 39:58.309
No drugs, no boyfriends.

39:58.342 --> 40:01.842
- Is this her handwriting?
- Yes.

40:01.875 --> 40:04.442
She's kind and she's smart.

40:04.476 --> 40:06.276
I told the police,
but they just didn't care.

40:06.309 --> 40:08.175
- She's a good girl.
- She did everything,

40:08.209 --> 40:11.109
coke, oxy, speed, ecstasy.

40:11.142 --> 40:12.576
She was such a beautiful child.

40:12.609 --> 40:16.109
- Is it Jennifer?
- Coke, oxy, speed, ecstasy.

40:16.142 --> 40:17.542
She was such a beautiful child.

40:17.576 --> 40:19.476
Is it Jennifer?

40:25.442 --> 40:28.042
Hey, Cap, Cap, Cap, hey.

40:28.075 --> 40:30.276
Okay, Hailey Coleman's
been missing

40:30.309 --> 40:32.142
- for seven months, right?
- Right.

40:32.175 --> 40:34.875
Right? Jennifer Collins,
missing for five years.

40:34.908 --> 40:36.242
Right, Linda Bridges
missing for four

40:36.276 --> 40:37.842
until we found her.

40:37.875 --> 40:39.409
What do they all have
in common?

40:39.442 --> 40:41.109
They all send a postcard
to their family

40:41.142 --> 40:42.942
telling them to stop
looking for 'em.

40:42.975 --> 40:45.842
Look, "The colors of the world
are so vibrant.

40:45.875 --> 40:47.542
I love you all.
Remember me and smile,

40:47.576 --> 40:51.109
for it's better to forget
than to remember me and cry."

40:51.142 --> 40:54.009
It's a quote
from a Dr. Seuss book.

40:54.042 --> 40:55.875
Where are you going with this?

40:55.908 --> 40:57.808
They all went
to the same school.

40:57.842 --> 41:00.875
They even shared
some of the same classes.

41:14.376 --> 41:15.342
Afternoon.

41:16.376 --> 41:19.042
Afternoon.

41:19.075 --> 41:21.042
What's going on here?

41:21.075 --> 41:22.875
I'm from the police department.

41:22.908 --> 41:24.242
I'm conducting an investigation

41:24.276 --> 41:26.942
on the disappearance
of Hailey Coleman.

41:26.975 --> 41:29.309
Oh, I understand.

41:29.342 --> 41:31.942
The cops came here
and were doing interviews

41:31.975 --> 41:33.309
after she disappeared.

41:33.342 --> 41:35.209
Right, and I'm just
following up

41:35.242 --> 41:37.142
on a couple things.

41:40.042 --> 41:42.942
Um, I'm Bradley Gilmore,
sociology professor.

41:42.975 --> 41:45.075
Mm. Detective Darren Hawk.

41:45.109 --> 41:47.476
And you were one of
Miss Coleman's professors, yeah?

41:47.509 --> 41:49.342
- That's right.
- Okay.

41:49.376 --> 41:52.009
You, uh, you notice anything
out of the ordinary

41:52.042 --> 41:54.175
about her, Professor?

41:54.209 --> 41:55.908
I can't say that I have.

41:55.942 --> 41:57.409
Okay.

41:57.442 --> 41:59.576
How many people do you
normally have in your class?

41:59.609 --> 42:03.808
Uh, 25 to 35, it depends.

42:03.842 --> 42:05.576
Was she a good student?

42:05.609 --> 42:08.242
She was an average student.

42:10.942 --> 42:14.342
- You married?
- Ah, yes.

42:14.376 --> 42:16.242
Thirty-one years.

42:18.875 --> 42:20.276
So is there anything else
I can help you with

42:20.309 --> 42:22.342
regarding Hailey?

42:22.376 --> 42:25.175
Uh, no, I'm done here.

42:25.209 --> 42:26.276
Let me give you
one of my cards.

42:26.309 --> 42:27.808
Here, the phone number
is on there.

42:27.842 --> 42:29.542
Just give me a call
if you find anything relevant

42:29.576 --> 42:31.276
or anything you think
might be of help

42:31.309 --> 42:33.342
to the investigation.

42:33.376 --> 42:35.908
- Will do.
- Great. Thanks.

42:35.942 --> 42:37.542
Mm-hm.

42:43.309 --> 42:47.075
You know, one other thing,
Professor.

42:47.109 --> 42:49.542
The name Jennifer Collins
or Linda Bridges

42:49.576 --> 42:52.509
- mean anything to you?
- Should they?

42:52.542 --> 42:53.409
Yeah, you know,
they were actually

42:53.442 --> 42:56.409
both students of yours
some years ago.

42:56.442 --> 42:59.209
They also went missing.

42:59.242 --> 43:02.342
But probably
just a coincidence.

43:03.975 --> 43:07.942
There is no such thing
as coincidence, Detective.

43:22.576 --> 43:25.075
Hailey...

43:32.609 --> 43:34.509
Take a seat.

43:53.175 --> 43:56.075
Did Hailey try to call
for help today?

44:01.442 --> 44:03.042
Well?

44:04.409 --> 44:06.109
No.

44:07.175 --> 44:09.542
That's good to hear.

44:14.509 --> 44:16.942
So, how's Hailey been doing?

44:21.509 --> 44:24.042
Well enough.

44:26.409 --> 44:28.942
She's a clever girl.

44:30.009 --> 44:32.476
Maybe too clever.

44:36.009 --> 44:37.808
Remember the first time
you tried to run away?

44:41.175 --> 44:44.476
It was the first day
I brought you here.

44:48.009 --> 44:52.209
That went on
for the first two weeks.

44:55.042 --> 44:57.042
Let's hope
that Hailey learns the rules

44:57.075 --> 44:59.576
quicker than you did.

45:34.342 --> 45:36.875
How many times
have you tried to escape?

45:36.908 --> 45:38.175
A few times.

45:38.209 --> 45:40.442
Ugh, but how does
he keep taking girls

45:40.476 --> 45:42.875
and getting away with it?

45:47.509 --> 45:50.376
Can you stop with the ball?

46:00.609 --> 46:01.975
Hailey?

46:04.376 --> 46:05.975
Hailey.

46:07.309 --> 46:09.942
What are you doing?

46:09.975 --> 46:11.342
What is this?

46:11.376 --> 46:12.942
The air duct.

46:23.276 --> 46:26.808
Look! We can climb out!

46:26.842 --> 46:28.942
Hailey, don't be stupid.

46:28.975 --> 46:31.442
Where do you think it leads?

46:31.476 --> 46:34.409
I don't know,
and I don't care.

46:34.442 --> 46:36.309
What's wrong?

46:36.342 --> 46:37.442
What is wrong with you?

46:37.476 --> 46:38.743
We can get out!

46:38.775 --> 46:41.309
Yeah, but do you know what'll
happen to us if he catches us?

46:41.342 --> 46:43.875
We have to try.

47:08.842 --> 47:11.109
DNA?

47:11.142 --> 47:12.875
Not yet.

47:12.908 --> 47:14.975
- It'll take at least two weeks...
- Some of these, they go as far

47:15.009 --> 47:16.276
- back as a decade.
- Then we'll be able

47:16.309 --> 47:19.109
to compare it against
the federal database.

47:19.142 --> 47:20.975
We're looking for a white male.

47:21.009 --> 47:23.042
He's probably
right around their age.

47:23.075 --> 47:25.175
Fingerprints?

47:25.209 --> 47:26.975
- Focused on...
- No, nothing.

47:27.009 --> 47:28.842
- She was all cleaned up.
- Most likely?

47:28.875 --> 47:30.542
They both got the same MO.

47:30.576 --> 47:33.109
- Anything on the car?
- No, that was also...

47:33.142 --> 47:36.908
Yes, there is evidence of both
vaginal and anal intercourse.

47:39.276 --> 47:42.209
- No, no, no drugs...
- The name Jennifer Collins

47:42.242 --> 47:44.042
or Linda Bridges
mean anything to you?

47:44.075 --> 47:45.376
Should they?

47:52.442 --> 47:56.042
That is a name I thought
I would never hear again.

47:56.075 --> 47:59.476
What can you tell me?

47:59.509 --> 48:01.209
He was charming,

48:01.242 --> 48:03.908
smart, and fun.

48:03.942 --> 48:04.942
They started dating,

48:04.975 --> 48:08.409
and she moved into his house.

48:08.442 --> 48:12.542
And what I recall
from her is when

48:12.576 --> 48:16.975
he started raping
her repeatedly.

48:17.009 --> 48:19.109
For how long?

48:19.142 --> 48:22.042
Three years, she told us.

48:22.075 --> 48:23.908
Finally, she had
the courage to leave,

48:23.942 --> 48:27.142
and later on,
she filed charges.

48:27.175 --> 48:30.209
Okay, and then what happened?

48:30.242 --> 48:32.476
He had his army of lawyers

48:32.509 --> 48:34.075
make a deal.

48:34.109 --> 48:35.542
I think she just
wanted him to leave,

48:35.576 --> 48:40.442
and she got some money
and went abroad.

48:40.476 --> 48:43.242
I never spoke to her again.

48:43.276 --> 48:45.509
A real shame.

48:45.542 --> 48:47.476
You never spoke to her
after she left?

48:47.509 --> 48:49.042
No, nothing.

48:49.075 --> 48:50.476
She sent me postcards
at the beginning,

48:50.509 --> 48:52.576
then they stopped.

48:52.609 --> 48:54.442
You still have the postcards?

48:59.309 --> 49:00.542
Well, go ahead.

49:00.576 --> 49:02.142
All right, thank you, brother.

49:05.376 --> 49:09.109
I thought we were looking
for somebody more their age.

49:09.142 --> 49:11.376
A loner.

49:11.409 --> 49:14.942
I was wrong.

49:14.975 --> 49:17.908
What makes you say
you're not wrong again?

49:17.942 --> 49:18.942
Trust me.

49:21.409 --> 49:24.576
- Trust you?
- Mm.

49:24.609 --> 49:28.376
Bradley Gilmore is
a pillar in this community,

49:28.409 --> 49:32.109
and he has many friends that
can make my life difficult.

49:32.142 --> 49:34.309
I live here.

49:34.342 --> 49:37.075
He is my community.

49:37.109 --> 49:39.242
- So to ask me to...
- Look, it's him, okay?

49:39.276 --> 49:41.209
All right, I'm tellin' you.

49:41.242 --> 49:43.109
All right, and I can prove it.

49:43.142 --> 49:46.576
How?

49:46.609 --> 49:47.875
I don't think he's married.

49:47.908 --> 49:50.276
- Ugh.
- No, Nancy,

49:50.309 --> 49:52.342
he's got a 25-year-old rape case

49:52.376 --> 49:54.142
that has no mention
of a wife in it,

49:54.175 --> 49:56.175
yet he tells me that
he's married for 31 years.

49:56.209 --> 49:57.842
Now, I looked.

49:57.875 --> 50:00.309
I can't find any
mention of a wife

50:00.342 --> 50:02.209
anywhere in his life.

50:02.242 --> 50:03.808
I've interviewed locals,

50:03.842 --> 50:05.042
I've talked to
everybody around him,

50:05.075 --> 50:09.276
and nobody has so much as seen
him in public with his wife.

50:09.309 --> 50:11.942
Maybe he doesn't take her out.

50:17.042 --> 50:18.842
How long you been married?

50:18.875 --> 50:20.175
Twenty-seven years.

50:20.209 --> 50:23.309
All right, now if
I was to jump online

50:23.342 --> 50:25.342
and search for you and Bill,

50:25.376 --> 50:27.975
how many pictures,
articles, references,

50:28.009 --> 50:32.109
just general hits
do you think I'd get?

50:32.142 --> 50:35.875
I don't know, ten?

50:35.908 --> 50:38.942
I found 53.

50:41.075 --> 50:45.942
And how many for
Bradley and his wife?

50:45.975 --> 50:48.175
Zero.

52:51.975 --> 52:54.476
Hey, Professor Gilmore!

52:54.509 --> 52:57.309
Fancy seein' you here, ha!

52:57.342 --> 52:58.975
Detective Hawk.

52:59.009 --> 53:02.009
Ah, that's a beaut you got here!

53:02.042 --> 53:03.842
What is she, about a 40-foot?

53:03.875 --> 53:05.509
That's right!

53:05.542 --> 53:08.342
- You know your boats.
- I do.

53:08.376 --> 53:11.409
Uh, Laura.

53:11.442 --> 53:13.842
Why, uh, why Laura?

53:13.875 --> 53:16.142
Named it after my wife.

53:16.175 --> 53:19.175
Your wife?

53:19.209 --> 53:21.142
Funny, I don't see that wedding
ring on there, professor.

53:21.175 --> 53:22.175
Don't you, uh,

53:22.209 --> 53:24.442
don't you normally
have that wedding ring on?

53:24.476 --> 53:27.409
Eh, I don't wear it
when I work on the boat.

53:27.442 --> 53:29.908
Right.

53:29.942 --> 53:31.042
Well, it's good to see you.

53:31.075 --> 53:33.409
I gotta keep on workin'
before the sun goes down.

53:33.442 --> 53:34.975
Right.

53:37.242 --> 53:38.442
Hillary Jones.

53:41.942 --> 53:44.376
Uh, what about her?

53:44.409 --> 53:46.576
Oh, you know,
I just met her brother.

53:46.609 --> 53:50.276
He told me that you
used to be her boyfriend.

53:50.309 --> 53:51.942
Boyfriend? No,

53:51.975 --> 53:54.576
but we used to
fool around a little.

53:54.609 --> 53:56.509
How she doin'?

53:56.542 --> 53:58.442
Oh, she's good.

53:58.476 --> 54:02.409
Believe she's, uh,
somewhere in Europe.

54:02.442 --> 54:04.175
Good for her!

54:04.209 --> 54:06.542
That was always her dream.

54:06.576 --> 54:08.442
What was?

54:08.476 --> 54:10.009
To travel.

54:12.175 --> 54:14.842
Have a good night, detective.

54:17.342 --> 54:18.875
You too.

54:20.908 --> 54:22.242
♪ Run all night ♪

54:22.276 --> 54:24.075
♪ Goin' to run all day ♪

54:24.109 --> 54:25.908
♪ I bet my money

54:25.942 --> 54:30.009

54:30.042 --> 54:33.175
That was by Stephen Foster,

54:33.209 --> 54:37.075
the "Father of American Music."

54:37.109 --> 54:40.042
You know, in the 19th century,

54:40.075 --> 54:42.109
he was a rock star,

54:42.142 --> 54:45.075
the rock star.

54:45.109 --> 54:48.509
Everybody sang his songs.

54:48.542 --> 54:51.442
In the minstrel shows,
they sang it in blackface.

54:53.842 --> 54:57.842
Of course,
we can't do that today.

54:57.875 --> 54:59.942
And he died when he was 37

54:59.975 --> 55:03.142
with three cents in his wallet.

55:03.175 --> 55:05.209
Anyway,

55:05.242 --> 55:08.775
Hailey, you play piano?

55:11.942 --> 55:14.476
I used to as a kid.

55:14.509 --> 55:16.442
Okay, come join me.

55:38.908 --> 55:42.842
So, what do you remember?

55:42.875 --> 55:46.542
I don't remember much.

55:46.576 --> 55:48.242
Try.

55:59.842 --> 56:03.075
Again.

56:06.209 --> 56:07.875
Again.

56:10.476 --> 56:13.142
Again.

56:15.276 --> 56:17.442
Again!

56:19.042 --> 56:21.409
Again!

56:23.276 --> 56:25.476
Again!

56:27.842 --> 56:30.042
Again!

56:32.409 --> 56:34.576
Again!

56:36.142 --> 56:38.442
Again!

56:40.142 --> 56:42.908
Again!

57:17.009 --> 57:18.376
Hailey,

57:18.409 --> 57:20.576
are you all right?

57:20.609 --> 57:24.009
I've gotta get outta here.

57:24.042 --> 57:25.476
Hailey.

57:28.242 --> 57:30.309
I can't stay here.

57:30.342 --> 57:32.376
I can't, I can't do this.

57:32.409 --> 57:34.142
I can't live like this.

57:34.175 --> 57:36.242
How can anybody live like this?

57:36.276 --> 57:40.242
With these fucking
cameras on you all day!

57:40.276 --> 57:42.142
Hailey, what have you done?

57:42.175 --> 57:44.309
Do you know what
he's gonna do to you?

57:44.342 --> 57:45.509
I've gotta get outta here!

57:45.542 --> 57:47.442
No, Hailey, no, listen!

57:47.476 --> 57:49.309
The only reason I have
lasted this long is because

57:49.342 --> 57:51.509
I connect with him.

57:51.542 --> 57:54.142
- I talk to him.
- He fucks you!

57:54.175 --> 57:55.942
No, it's not what you think.

57:55.975 --> 57:59.276
You let him fuck you.

57:59.309 --> 58:01.109
What is wrong with you?

58:04.209 --> 58:06.576
You like it.

58:06.609 --> 58:09.009
You watch your mouth.

58:09.042 --> 58:12.009
You're just as
fucked up as he is.

58:43.576 --> 58:45.409
Hailey!

58:47.409 --> 58:49.942
Hailey!

58:49.975 --> 58:52.075
Hailey, can you hear me?

58:52.109 --> 58:54.409
Yeah, yeah.

58:54.442 --> 58:56.476
Are you all right?

58:56.509 --> 58:58.175
I think so.

59:06.209 --> 59:08.142
I have to go.

59:08.175 --> 59:10.442
What? No, no,
no, no, no, no!

59:10.476 --> 59:12.209
No, you can't leave me here!

59:14.442 --> 59:16.042
Jennifer?

59:20.142 --> 59:21.842
Jennifer?

59:43.276 --> 59:44.875
Where's Hailey?

59:49.509 --> 59:51.342
I asked you a question.

59:57.376 --> 01:00:00.509
Um, Hailey is, uh...

01:00:00.542 --> 01:00:01.509
Right here.

01:00:06.576 --> 01:00:09.875
Sorry, I was reading,

01:00:09.908 --> 01:00:13.109
and I lost track of time.

01:00:13.142 --> 01:00:15.942
Clean yourself up.

01:00:15.975 --> 01:00:17.908
You look a mess.

01:00:29.309 --> 01:00:33.042
So Pygmalion was
a brilliant sculptor

01:00:33.075 --> 01:00:35.808
who lived in ancient Greece.

01:00:37.476 --> 01:00:40.175
He loved his work,

01:00:40.209 --> 01:00:42.175
and he would spend hours

01:00:42.209 --> 01:00:45.409
carving beautiful ivory statues.

01:00:47.509 --> 01:00:50.542
He had no time for women,
he would always say,

01:00:50.576 --> 01:00:54.875
only his sculptures.

01:00:54.908 --> 01:00:58.442
Now, there was a deeper reason
for his aversion to women.

01:00:58.476 --> 01:01:01.309
You see, in that area of Cyprus,

01:01:01.342 --> 01:01:04.209
the women had failed to
pay homage to Aphrodite,

01:01:04.242 --> 01:01:06.808
the goddess of love.

01:01:06.842 --> 01:01:08.509
And, of course, this
could not go unpunished,

01:01:08.542 --> 01:01:10.342
so Aphrodite cursed the women

01:01:10.376 --> 01:01:14.908
to a loveless life
of prostitution.

01:01:14.942 --> 01:01:17.842
Now one day,

01:01:17.875 --> 01:01:22.009
he selected this big,
beautiful piece of ivory,

01:01:22.042 --> 01:01:24.542
and he sketched out a figure,

01:01:24.576 --> 01:01:26.576
and he started hammering

01:01:26.609 --> 01:01:29.442
and chiseling away
until he was finished.

01:01:31.342 --> 01:01:35.175
It was a statue of a woman
so exquisitely carved

01:01:35.209 --> 01:01:37.942
that she seemed almost alive.

01:01:40.142 --> 01:01:42.842
And he instantly fell
in love with his creation...

01:01:44.942 --> 01:01:47.442
...and he clothed it,

01:01:47.476 --> 01:01:50.342
he gave it jewels,

01:01:50.376 --> 01:01:53.975
and he named it Galatea,

01:01:54.009 --> 01:01:56.808
which means "sleeping love."

01:01:59.409 --> 01:02:01.576
So he treated it like
it was his girlfriend,

01:02:01.609 --> 01:02:03.875
and he brought it
shells and pebbles,

01:02:03.908 --> 01:02:06.842
and little birds,

01:02:06.875 --> 01:02:09.242
flowers of all colors,

01:02:09.276 --> 01:02:12.175
anything that he thought
would please his love.

01:02:14.109 --> 01:02:15.875
And the more

01:02:15.908 --> 01:02:19.509
that he gazed upon Galatea,

01:02:19.542 --> 01:02:23.942
the more he yearned
for a wife of his own,

01:02:23.975 --> 01:02:25.808
but alive.

01:02:27.376 --> 01:02:31.342
He dreamed that she were
flesh and blood....

01:02:33.142 --> 01:02:36.276
...responsive to
his words and touch.

01:02:39.908 --> 01:02:42.542
And then one day,
Aphrodite granted his wish.

01:02:47.409 --> 01:02:50.975
Every man's dream...

01:02:51.009 --> 01:02:53.109
to build the perfect woman.

01:02:59.875 --> 01:03:01.875
That's absolutely right.

01:05:03.542 --> 01:05:06.342
So who destroyed the camera?

01:05:16.376 --> 01:05:18.276
What camera?

01:05:20.042 --> 01:05:21.476
Who destroyed it?

01:05:25.576 --> 01:05:27.142
She did it.

01:05:30.042 --> 01:05:30.942
What?

01:05:33.075 --> 01:05:35.376
She did it.

01:05:35.409 --> 01:05:38.476
She threw a book at it.

01:05:38.509 --> 01:05:42.175
- She's lying.
- She's trying to escape.

01:05:42.209 --> 01:05:44.542
She's lying!

01:05:46.576 --> 01:05:48.276
Stop!

01:05:52.609 --> 01:05:54.509
Stop!

01:05:54.542 --> 01:05:56.109
No!

01:06:28.242 --> 01:06:31.808
Hailey, do you know
how beautiful you are?

01:06:34.509 --> 01:06:36.376
Remove your pants.

01:07:08.409 --> 01:07:10.276
Lay down.

01:07:24.276 --> 01:07:26.242
Spread your legs.

01:08:18.908 --> 01:08:21.442
Please leave a message
after the tone.

01:08:22.609 --> 01:08:24.042
Hi, dear, it's...

01:08:24.075 --> 01:08:26.109
Just checking in on you.

01:08:26.808 --> 01:08:30.109
Have you found your sister?

01:08:31.009 --> 01:08:32.542
It's Mama.

01:08:36.009 --> 01:08:39.376
Hi, it's me.

01:08:39.408 --> 01:08:42.875
Please tell me
you found your sister.

01:08:59.908 --> 01:09:01.975
Look at the picture,
and tell me if you've seen

01:09:02.009 --> 01:09:03.875
that beautiful, beautiful face.

01:09:03.908 --> 01:09:06.942
Tell me if you've seen that
beautiful, beautiful face!

01:09:09.109 --> 01:09:11.408
It's really simple.

01:09:11.442 --> 01:09:12.509
- Thank you.
- Hawk,

01:09:12.542 --> 01:09:16.009
Hawk, he's not helping.

01:09:16.042 --> 01:09:20.142
- Hey, Mom, Mom, it's okay.
- You're not helping!

01:09:20.175 --> 01:09:21.442
You're not helping!

01:09:21.475 --> 01:09:24.242
I mean, it's like
a tag or something.

01:09:24.276 --> 01:09:27.209
I think she's,
I think she's in the trash.

01:09:27.242 --> 01:09:28.209
His fault, okay?

01:09:28.242 --> 01:09:29.942
Here, I want you to walk
around this side, okay?

01:09:29.975 --> 01:09:32.908
It is his fault
'cause she comes here,

01:09:32.942 --> 01:09:34.475
- I know she comes here!
- I know she comes here.

01:09:34.509 --> 01:09:36.276
You can sit in
the front, all right?

01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:38.408
Come on, get in.

01:09:38.442 --> 01:09:39.442
It's okay.

01:09:39.475 --> 01:09:40.942
Thank you, Willy.

01:09:40.975 --> 01:09:42.042
All right, you okay? You in?

01:09:42.075 --> 01:09:43.875
- Yes!
- All right.

01:09:46.442 --> 01:09:49.841
I would just like for you to
just at least listen to me

01:09:49.875 --> 01:09:52.341
when I want you to do
something, and just do it.

01:09:52.376 --> 01:09:53.542
I'm listening to you.

01:09:53.576 --> 01:09:56.276
- You're useless, Hawk!
- I'm not him!

01:09:56.309 --> 01:09:58.309
Sometimes you act just like him.

01:09:58.342 --> 01:10:00.576
It's just the same
old shit all the time.

01:10:00.609 --> 01:10:02.409
- You do!
- I don't hate you, Mom.

01:10:02.442 --> 01:10:03.975
- You do.
- No, I...

01:10:04.009 --> 01:10:05.175
- I don't hate you.
- You would do

01:10:05.209 --> 01:10:06.309
what I asked you to do,

01:10:06.342 --> 01:10:09.476
if you didn't hate me,
and admit you would do that.

01:10:09.509 --> 01:10:13.009
- That's just how that goes.
- Mom, I don't hate you.

01:10:31.109 --> 01:10:32.542
Oh.

01:11:41.542 --> 01:11:43.409
We need to escape.

01:11:46.175 --> 01:11:48.442
You said it was impossible.

01:11:48.476 --> 01:11:50.542
Alone,

01:11:50.576 --> 01:11:53.509
but we can do it together.

01:11:53.542 --> 01:11:55.042
When?

01:11:55.075 --> 01:11:56.075
Tomorrow.

01:11:56.109 --> 01:11:58.975
You found the air duct,
that's our best chance.

01:11:59.009 --> 01:12:00.975
- Where did it lead?
- The attic,

01:12:01.009 --> 01:12:03.109
which leads to
the rest of the house.

01:12:03.142 --> 01:12:05.042
We need to get to the garage.

01:12:05.075 --> 01:12:06.342
What's in there?

01:12:06.376 --> 01:12:10.875
A car with keys inside,
and we can get away.

01:12:10.908 --> 01:12:13.342
Do you think that'll work?

01:12:13.376 --> 01:12:15.175
Yeah.

01:12:15.209 --> 01:12:16.908
It'll work.

01:12:35.242 --> 01:12:38.342
Okay, so she burst
in here askin' for help,

01:12:38.376 --> 01:12:40.276
and then what?

01:12:40.309 --> 01:12:42.476
I took her by the hands, I...

01:12:42.509 --> 01:12:44.908
talked to her,
tried to calm her.

01:12:44.942 --> 01:12:47.442
She was so scared.

01:12:47.476 --> 01:12:50.109
Greg came in,
she just freaked out.

01:12:50.142 --> 01:12:51.542
So she was scared
at the sight of you?

01:12:51.576 --> 01:12:53.175
Hell yeah, she was.

01:12:53.209 --> 01:12:55.342
I never seen anything like it.

01:12:55.376 --> 01:12:57.376
Straight out of a horror movie.

01:13:02.442 --> 01:13:05.242
And then she just ran off?

01:13:05.276 --> 01:13:08.409
Yeah, she just ran away.

01:13:08.442 --> 01:13:11.476
The cops came afterwards,
and we told 'em everything.

01:13:11.509 --> 01:13:14.842
So you're certain
that was her?

01:13:14.875 --> 01:13:18.975
Yes, this is the woman that
came burstin' through my door.

01:13:19.009 --> 01:13:20.542
And you, sir?

01:13:20.576 --> 01:13:22.175
That's her.

01:13:22.209 --> 01:13:24.276
I will never forget that face.

01:13:26.242 --> 01:13:28.442
The crossroads of life.

01:13:28.476 --> 01:13:31.075
These dramatic stories are
presented with the cooperation

01:13:31.109 --> 01:13:33.075
of our board of advisors,

01:13:33.109 --> 01:13:35.509
Captain Maurice
M. Witherspoon...

01:13:38.875 --> 01:13:41.075
...Father George B. Ford.

01:14:04.075 --> 01:14:05.808
Detective Hawk.

01:14:05.842 --> 01:14:07.808
So, this is where you live, huh?

01:14:07.842 --> 01:14:09.276
Yes.

01:14:09.309 --> 01:14:11.409
Is there a good reason
why you're out so late?

01:14:11.442 --> 01:14:15.209
There is, I'm investigating
a burglary in the area.

01:14:15.242 --> 01:14:17.908
Could be connected
to a case that I'm workin'.

01:14:17.942 --> 01:14:19.808
Have you, uh,

01:14:19.842 --> 01:14:22.476
you witnessed anything
suspicious in the area?

01:14:22.509 --> 01:14:24.576
I can't say that I have.

01:14:24.609 --> 01:14:27.542
This is a gated community.

01:14:27.576 --> 01:14:29.342
Just you in here?

01:14:29.376 --> 01:14:31.042
Me and my wife.

01:14:31.075 --> 01:14:33.376
Right.

01:14:33.409 --> 01:14:34.942
Okay, well,

01:14:34.975 --> 01:14:37.442
you know, I'm just
checkin' in, that's all.

01:14:37.476 --> 01:14:38.542
Okay, thank you.

01:14:38.576 --> 01:14:40.376
Hey, hey.

01:14:40.409 --> 01:14:43.209
You mind if I come in?

01:14:43.242 --> 01:14:46.142
Uh, sure.

01:14:46.175 --> 01:14:48.576
I was about to brew
a cup of tea.

01:14:48.609 --> 01:14:49.808
Would you like some?

01:14:49.842 --> 01:14:51.209
Sure, that'd be great.

01:14:51.242 --> 01:14:53.808
Okay.

01:14:53.842 --> 01:14:55.376
Wow!

01:14:55.409 --> 01:14:57.409
That's quite the, uh,

01:14:57.442 --> 01:14:59.576
art collection you have here.

01:14:59.609 --> 01:15:01.875
Oh, thank you.

01:15:01.908 --> 01:15:04.109
From my travels
around the world.

01:15:04.142 --> 01:15:05.842
With your wife?

01:15:05.875 --> 01:15:08.309
Yes.

01:15:08.342 --> 01:15:11.009
And, uh, no kids?

01:15:11.042 --> 01:15:12.209
No.

01:15:14.509 --> 01:15:17.476
Uh, nature
wasn't so kind to us.

01:15:17.509 --> 01:15:21.442
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

01:15:24.209 --> 01:15:25.908
We have to do it now.

01:15:28.476 --> 01:15:30.109
You go first.

01:15:30.142 --> 01:15:32.442
I'll come after.

01:15:32.476 --> 01:15:35.075
I don't see any
family portraits, uh,

01:15:35.109 --> 01:15:37.209
nothin' with you or your mom.

01:15:39.009 --> 01:15:40.476
No.

01:15:40.509 --> 01:15:42.242
Yeah, you know it, uh...

01:15:44.309 --> 01:15:46.442
...must have been terrible

01:15:46.476 --> 01:15:48.942
what you witnessed.

01:15:48.975 --> 01:15:50.442
What?

01:15:50.476 --> 01:15:53.442
Well, what your father
did to your mother.

01:15:53.476 --> 01:15:55.442
You know, I read the reports.

01:15:55.476 --> 01:15:57.509
Said you were the one that
called the police, huh?

01:15:59.576 --> 01:16:01.276
Everything okay?

01:16:01.309 --> 01:16:04.942
Oh, it's okay,
it's just my wife.

01:16:16.542 --> 01:16:19.142
Okay, come on!

01:16:21.908 --> 01:16:23.175
Come on!

01:16:25.476 --> 01:16:26.942
Jennifer?

01:16:32.409 --> 01:16:33.942
Jennifer?

01:16:37.409 --> 01:16:39.075
Jennifer?

01:16:44.942 --> 01:16:46.476
Fuck!

01:17:00.409 --> 01:17:02.342
So, is there anything
else I can do for you

01:17:02.376 --> 01:17:04.576
regarding, uh, the burglaries?

01:17:04.609 --> 01:17:08.342
Um, no, you know, it's,

01:17:08.376 --> 01:17:11.342
it's just a matter of time
until we find the guy.

01:17:11.376 --> 01:17:15.009
Well, you seem certain
that it's a man.

01:17:15.042 --> 01:17:18.476
It usually is.

01:17:18.509 --> 01:17:20.009
Okay, well, thank you!

01:17:20.042 --> 01:17:22.908
You know what, hey,
just one last thing.

01:17:22.942 --> 01:17:24.009
You know,

01:17:24.042 --> 01:17:25.142
you might wanna look into that

01:17:25.175 --> 01:17:27.842
missing marriage certificate.

01:17:27.875 --> 01:17:29.042
Pardon me?

01:17:29.075 --> 01:17:31.109
Well, you know,
just no matter what I do,

01:17:31.142 --> 01:17:35.309
I can't seem to find
any record of your marriage.

01:17:35.342 --> 01:17:38.075
There must be some mistake.

01:17:38.109 --> 01:17:40.808
But, thank you, I'll
look into that right away.

01:17:41.609 --> 01:17:42.476
What was that?

01:17:42.509 --> 01:17:44.576
That's my wife,
I really need to go.

01:17:44.609 --> 01:17:46.808
Well, hey, you know,
I'd love to meet her.

01:17:46.842 --> 01:17:49.109
You know, that would be lovely.

01:17:49.142 --> 01:17:51.276
How 'bout some time next week?

01:17:51.309 --> 01:17:52.875
Right here.

01:22:58.242 --> 01:23:00.409
Hey, Ma.

01:23:00.442 --> 01:23:03.175
Hawk?

01:23:03.209 --> 01:23:06.309
I'm here, Ma.

01:23:06.342 --> 01:23:07.175
What's goin' on?

01:23:07.209 --> 01:23:11.342
I am running low
on cigs and Sprite.

01:23:11.376 --> 01:23:15.142
- Can you fix that for me?
- Yeah, look, I can, I just,

01:23:15.175 --> 01:23:16.509
I need about
a little bit of time

01:23:16.542 --> 01:23:20.009
to finish up
somethin' at work, okay?

01:23:20.042 --> 01:23:21.542
Okay.

01:23:21.576 --> 01:23:23.276
Have you found your sister?

01:23:23.309 --> 01:23:25.376
I haven't yet, Mom.

01:23:25.409 --> 01:23:26.908
- I'm tryin'.
- Well, I need her

01:23:26.942 --> 01:23:29.075
to be here with me,
I need you both.

01:23:29.109 --> 01:23:31.175
I know, I know that.

01:23:31.209 --> 01:23:33.276
Look, I'll be there soon, okay?

01:23:34.975 --> 01:23:37.975
So, how far away are you?

01:23:38.009 --> 01:23:40.276
Can you give me, like, an hour?

01:23:40.309 --> 01:23:42.209
Yes, okay, an hour.

01:23:42.242 --> 01:23:44.509
An hour's okay, okay, okay.

01:23:44.542 --> 01:23:46.342
Please, just,

01:23:46.376 --> 01:23:48.376
bring me your sister, okay?

01:23:48.409 --> 01:23:49.875
I will, Ma.

01:23:53.309 --> 01:23:54.808
Hey, Mom?

01:23:54.842 --> 01:23:55.975
Mm-hmm?

01:24:04.309 --> 01:24:06.109
Nothin', hey,

01:24:06.142 --> 01:24:08.109
I'll see you soon, okay?

01:26:52.908 --> 01:26:55.142
Wait,

01:26:55.175 --> 01:26:56.576
Jennifer?

01:26:56.609 --> 01:27:00.209
Is that... Jennifer, is that you?

01:28:00.409 --> 01:28:02.442
Give me the gun.

01:28:08.042 --> 01:28:10.109
Give me the gun.

01:28:18.042 --> 01:28:20.009
Give me the gun.
