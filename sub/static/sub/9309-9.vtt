- Oh... my...
- It's great, right?

01:00.357 --> 01:03.526
- Oh, you were so right.
- About what?

01:03.560 --> 01:05.428
Oh, don't be modest.
This is all you.

01:05.462 --> 01:07.229
I can't believe I didn't listen
to you sooner. [Keys clatter]

01:07.264 --> 01:09.265
I'm not sure what it is
you think I said,

01:09.299 --> 01:12.268
but I am fairly certain that
there's been a miscommunication.

01:12.302 --> 01:13.769
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on.

01:13.804 --> 01:16.272
All the nagging that you did
about how I should...

01:16.306 --> 01:19.041
change up my wardrobe,
shake it up?

01:19.076 --> 01:20.743
Well, I took your advice.

01:20.777 --> 01:24.013
Well, I just meant you should
expand your wardrobe a little.

01:24.047 --> 01:28.487
Yes!
And I can't stop doing this!

01:28.685 --> 01:31.420
Okay, well, it's a bold choice.

01:31.455 --> 01:33.222
Mm! And the jacket's
just the beginning.

01:33.256 --> 01:34.623
What do you think about overalls?

01:34.658 --> 01:38.160
[Cell phone rings]
Hmm.

01:38.195 --> 01:40.796
[Scoffs]

01:40.831 --> 01:45.167
Mm. Still avoiding calls
from our father, are we?

01:45.202 --> 01:48.137
I do not have time to chat.

01:48.171 --> 01:50.306
I thought you were gonna
talk to him.

01:50.340 --> 01:51.707
Yes, I thought I was, too.

01:51.741 --> 01:54.620
- When's he leave?
- Saturday.

01:54.655 --> 01:56.545
But he wants to get
together tonight, have dinner,

01:56.580 --> 01:58.714
go over some paperwork
for the family trust.

01:58.748 --> 01:59.849
Mm. Good.

01:59.850 --> 02:02.051
You guys can finally talk, get it
all out. [Touch screen clicking]

02:02.085 --> 02:03.285
What are you doing?

02:03.320 --> 02:05.121
I'm helping.
What time works for you?

02:05.155 --> 02:07.556
That is not helping.

02:07.591 --> 02:10.292
[Cell phone thuds]
You can do this, Maura.

02:10.327 --> 02:12.795
[Sighs] I wouldn't even
know where to start.

02:12.829 --> 02:15.631
Okay, well, how about, uh,

02:15.665 --> 02:17.466
"You cheated on my mom
and then made me lie about it,

02:17.501 --> 02:20.536
which sucked"?
That sums it up nicely.

02:20.570 --> 02:22.071
Yeah, but what good
would it really do?

02:22.105 --> 02:23.806
I mean, so much time has passed.

02:23.840 --> 02:26.242
Yeah, but you're still
carrying it around inside.

02:26.276 --> 02:28.777
So you could just get it out
and tell him how you feel.

02:28.812 --> 02:30.579
Wait. You're one to talk.

02:30.614 --> 02:32.081
You don't tell anyone how you feel.

02:32.115 --> 02:33.782
Well, I'll tell you
how I feel right now.

02:33.817 --> 02:35.351
I feel that you should do this...
[cell phone buzzes]

02:35.385 --> 02:37.219
...or you're gonna be
avoiding him forever.

02:37.254 --> 02:39.088
That is a statement, not a feeling.
[Cell phone buzzes]

02:39.122 --> 02:42.158
- Doesn't make it any less true. Rizzoli.
- Isles.

02:42.192 --> 02:44.426
[Whispering] Do you wanna
borrow my jacket?

02:44.461 --> 02:45.861
Yeah, put it on and go like this.

02:45.896 --> 02:48.631
Makes you feel incredible,
like you could do anything.

02:48.665 --> 02:51.700
[Lowered voice] Like shoot
targets while riding a horse?

02:51.735 --> 02:53.435
Yes, and solve crimes.

02:53.470 --> 02:56.049
- Yes. No, that sounds terrible.
- No, I'm here.

02:56.050 --> 02:57.339
- We'll be right there.
- Mm-hmm.

[Car doors shut] So don't make
it a dinner with your father.

03:26.653 --> 03:29.355
- Do something casual.
- My father and I don't do casual.

03:29.389 --> 03:31.190

03:33.627 --> 03:37.296

- Mm, it was all Maura's idea.

03:37.330 --> 03:39.465
I never mentioned fringe.

03:39.499 --> 03:43.469
- Victim's at the bottom of the hill.
- Thank you, sergeant.

03:43.703 --> 03:45.438
You messing with her?

03:45.472 --> 03:46.672
[Chuckles] Yeah.

03:46.706 --> 03:49.475
I'm making a point, but it's always so

03:49.476 --> 03:52.244
much more fun to amuse
myself while I do it.

03:52.279 --> 03:55.714
- What do we got?
- Well, hikers found him this morning.

03:55.749 --> 03:58.284
Appears to have fallen from up top.

03:58.318 --> 03:59.785
- Ow.
- Yeah.

03:59.820 --> 04:02.688
He was hard to see. The body
was behind those rocks.

04:02.722 --> 04:04.690
<i>The victim was a student
over at state.</i>

04:04.724 --> 04:06.192
Stuart Crane.

04:06.226 --> 04:10.262
Only thing he had on him was
his student I.D. and keys.

04:10.297 --> 04:13.032
No cash, no credit cards.
No cell phone.

04:13.066 --> 04:15.568
- Robbery?
- Possible.

04:15.602 --> 04:18.170
C.S.R.U.'s up top.
They haven't found much.

04:18.204 --> 04:20.539
Prescott Trail is real popular.
There's footprints everywhere.

04:20.574 --> 04:22.575
- Any witnesses?
- Not so far.

04:22.609 --> 04:25.311
Part of the cliff's broken away.

04:25.345 --> 04:27.513
You can see where he tried
to get himself up.

04:27.547 --> 04:31.457
Must've lost his grip.
Crime techs found these.

04:32.853 --> 04:34.720
Maura, anything interesting?

04:34.754 --> 04:37.933
There are signs of rigor mortis
on the jaw and hands.

04:38.025 --> 04:39.847
I'd estimate the time of death to be about...

04:39.848 --> 04:42.461
- three to four hours ago.
- Around sunrise.

04:42.496 --> 04:45.064
Abrasions and bruising are
consisnt with a fall.

04:45.098 --> 04:47.399
Might've slipped.
Still pretty dark around dawn.

04:47.434 --> 04:49.435
Except there are two wounds
in the back of the skull

04:49.469 --> 04:52.605
that resulted in
a severely depressed fracture.

04:52.639 --> 04:57.858
They appear too similar...
to be from a random fall.

04:57.893 --> 04:59.345
You think somebody hit him
with something?

04:59.379 --> 05:03.215
I can't be certain yet.
The wounds have abraded margins,

05:03.217 --> 05:05.678
which could've been caused
by something dense

05:05.713 --> 05:08.387
Or blows that were delivered
with tremendous pressure.

05:08.405 --> 05:11.918
Frankie, have C.S.R.U. pay close
attention to the rocks up top.

05:11.953 --> 05:14.054
Blood trace would be easy to miss.

05:14.088 --> 05:17.490
[Groans] Guess I'll be getting
my cardio for the week.

05:17.525 --> 05:18.892
[Chuckles]

05:18.926 --> 05:21.027
There's unusual trauma
to the fingers and hands.

05:21.062 --> 05:22.316
Unusual how?

05:22.317 --> 05:26.080
Well, the bones in the
fingertips appear to be broken.

05:26.147 --> 05:27.834
Broken fingers and a cracked skull?

05:27.869 --> 05:29.603
Doesn't sound much like a robbery.

05:29.637 --> 05:31.137
Sounds like he pissed somebody off.

05:38.112 --> 05:42.515
- Like, dead dead?
- I'm afraid so.

05:42.550 --> 05:45.819
- You two close?
- I barely know the guy.

05:45.821 --> 05:47.087
You were roommates.

05:47.121 --> 05:49.689
Well, no offense,
but dude's super boring.

05:49.724 --> 05:52.125
Yeah, he's like an
English major or somethin'.

05:52.159 --> 05:55.028
Any idea why he was up at
Prescott Trail early this morning?

05:55.062 --> 05:57.564
Well, he usually takes off
before the sun's up.

05:57.598 --> 05:59.655
Did he have any problems with anyone?

05:59.689 --> 06:03.425
- Like you know, arguments or fights?
- Not that I ever heard about.

06:03.459 --> 06:05.193
Do you mind telling me
how you got that shiner?

06:05.228 --> 06:07.663
Oh, I bodychecked a forward
at hockey practice this mornin'.

06:07.697 --> 06:09.598
It's nice, huh?

06:10.733 --> 06:16.505
- Wallet's here ... debit card, cash.
- So it probably wasn't robbery.

06:16.539 --> 06:20.549
I'm gonna get this phone to Nina,
see if she can unlock it.

06:20.575 --> 06:24.046
- It's weird that he didn't have it with him.
- Most college kids,

06:24.080 --> 06:25.981
it's like they have them
permanently attached.

06:26.015 --> 06:28.781
Have a feeling he's not like
most college kids.

06:28.934 --> 06:30.655
First edition "Don Juan."
Lord Byron.

06:30.656 --> 06:32.376
Probably worth a
couple thousand dollars.

06:32.483 --> 06:35.205
[Chuckles] No way. Couple
thousand bucks for a book?

06:35.276 --> 06:39.628
- You know, like, just read it online, right?
- [laughs] Yeah. Right.

06:39.662 --> 06:40.996
Thank you.

06:41.230 --> 06:44.387
Go talk to some of
the other kids in this dorm.

06:44.484 --> 06:47.152
They can't all be knuckleheads.

06:49.310 --> 06:55.294
These are spiral fractures.
The twisting pattern is caused

06:55.344 --> 06:58.246
by pressure being exerted
by a moving object.

06:58.281 --> 07:00.059
Like someone was stepping
on his fingers?

07:00.195 --> 07:02.874
That would account for the pattern.
In fact, I believe it's

07:02.875 --> 07:05.554
likely that the damage was done
by a rubber-soled hiking boot.

07:05.588 --> 07:08.490
Dr. Isles, are you actually speculating

07:08.524 --> 07:11.026
about how this damage was inflicted?

07:11.060 --> 07:14.029
I don't need to speculate,
I have science.

07:14.063 --> 07:18.967
Specifically... [Typing]
I have Gaussian filters that can

07:18.982 --> 07:22.528
<i>isolate those particles.
I also found trace amounts</i>

07:22.529 --> 07:26.074
of thermoplastic
polyurethane on the skin,

07:26.109 --> 07:29.645
which is a synthetic rubber
commonly found on hiking boots.

07:29.679 --> 07:31.880
You really do love showing off
your toys, don'tcha?

07:31.914 --> 07:33.899
- I do.
- I get it.

07:33.986 --> 07:37.161
Now the cause of death is the trauma
to the back of the skull.

07:37.196 --> 07:40.031
Two blows from the same dense object
from different angles.

07:40.065 --> 07:43.601
The second blow was delivered
from a much higher vantage point.

07:43.636 --> 07:45.904
So unless our killer
had a sudden growth spurt,

07:45.938 --> 07:48.273
Stuart fell, and then
the killer hit him again.

07:48.307 --> 07:50.642
That would correlate to
my findings. [Cell phones]

07:50.676 --> 07:52.577
[Touch screen clicks]
Ok. Thanks, Maura.

07:54.346 --> 07:56.080
[Elevator bell dings]

07:57.983 --> 08:01.052
26. 27.
No, 28.

08:01.086 --> 08:02.954
- What's up?
- Oh, you're not gonna believe this.

08:04.223 --> 08:05.830
- 29. 30.
- No way.

08:05.844 --> 08:09.294
- What's going on?
- Nina unlocks Stuart's phone, and it's weird ...

08:09.328 --> 08:12.096
there's no email,
no calendar programs, no apps,

08:12.131 --> 08:14.392
- but there's a lot of texts.
- 31.

08:14.457 --> 08:16.668
- Now that's just greedy.
- 31 what?!

08:16.702 --> 08:18.836
- Women.
- What?

08:18.871 --> 08:21.572
Not just women, girlfriends.

08:21.607 --> 08:25.843
- 32.
- Stuart Crane had 32 girlfriends?

08:25.878 --> 08:27.111
Stuart wasn't just reading
"Don Juan."

08:27.113 --> 08:29.981
The guy was Don Juan.

08:38.794 --> 08:40.429
It's hard to believe he
had so many girlfriends.

08:40.462 --> 08:42.063
<i>Stuart doesn't seem like the type.</i>

08:42.097 --> 08:44.066
Some of these texts are sweet:

08:44.100 --> 08:46.335
"Before I met you,
I never knew what it was like

08:46.369 --> 08:49.004
to think of someone and smile
for absolutely no reason."

08:49.039 --> 08:50.873
- Aww.
- Seriously?

08:50.907 --> 08:54.276
- Sounds like a cheesy greeting card.
- I'd buy that card.

08:54.311 --> 08:56.745
I would, too.
Anything else interesting?

08:56.780 --> 08:59.014
So far, the conversations
are what you'd expect.

08:59.016 --> 09:01.150
"How was your day?
I miss you."

09:01.184 --> 09:03.219
<i>This woman is really into kittens.</i>

09:03.253 --> 09:06.188
- He tells her all the time how much he loves them.
- Mnh-mnh.

09:06.223 --> 09:08.346
So basically, he just tells them
what they wanna hear.

09:08.420 --> 09:10.237
Anybody talk to him about
meeting this morning?

09:10.322 --> 09:12.526
Not that I found yet.
As far as I can tell, he

09:12.527 --> 09:14.730
never met up with any of
the women he was dating.

09:14.764 --> 09:16.511
And none of them seem
to be from the college.

09:16.638 --> 09:19.357
- Maybe he met them online.
- Maybe, but I didn't find

09:19.358 --> 09:21.170
anything like that on his computer.

09:21.204 --> 09:22.705
He only used this cell for
chatting with his girlfriends,

09:22.739 --> 09:24.073
nothing with friends or family,

09:24.107 --> 09:25.941
which makes me think
he has a second phone.

09:25.976 --> 09:28.210
C.S.R.U. didn't find one
at the crime scene.

09:28.245 --> 09:29.712
Can you check
with other service providers

09:29.746 --> 09:30.946
- and see if you can find something?
- Mhm.

09:30.981 --> 09:32.481
Frankie, can you go back
to the dorm room,

09:32.515 --> 09:34.116
see if you can find the phone?

09:34.150 --> 09:36.352
- Yeah.
- Stuart Crane's mother lives in Ohio.

09:36.386 --> 09:38.721
He has a sister over in Hartford.
She's driving in now.

09:38.755 --> 09:40.222
[Beep]
Hey, look at this.

09:40.257 --> 09:42.391
<i>"Contact my wife again,
and you're a dead man."</i>

09:42.425 --> 09:43.926
There's a whole series of these.

09:43.960 --> 09:46.061
- Who's Donovan?
- That's Stuart's middle name.

09:46.096 --> 09:47.730
He used it with all his girlfriends.

09:47.764 --> 09:49.732
"You home-wrecking asshole.
I'll cut off your ..."

09:49.766 --> 09:53.002
- Ooh!
- That's some colorful language.

09:53.036 --> 09:54.770
Definitely not medically advisable.

09:54.804 --> 09:56.138
Well, let's get a name and address.

09:56.172 --> 09:59.508
Yeah, let's go see if he
still has his... [Laughs]

10:01.912 --> 10:04.280
<i>[Dog barks]
Man: Unbelievable.</i>

10:04.358 --> 10:06.610
That bastard had the nerve
to call the cops on me.

10:06.660 --> 10:08.721
You sent some pretty
threatening messages.

10:08.793 --> 10:11.820
You said you'd kill him
in some pretty creative ways.

10:11.855 --> 10:13.989
I was upset.
Wouldn't you be if you found out

10:14.024 --> 10:15.776
your wife had some secret boyfriend?

10:15.777 --> 10:18.406
Sure. I might even be mad
enough to confront the jerk,

10:18.453 --> 10:20.090
knock him around a little bit.
Is that how you felt?

10:20.124 --> 10:21.858
I wanted him to stop contacting Heather.

10:21.893 --> 10:25.028
I told you, honey, we were just texting.
It didn't mean anything.

10:25.062 --> 10:28.265
If Donovan has a problem, he should
talk to me about it in person.

10:28.299 --> 10:30.167
You have two convictions
of disorderly conduct.

10:30.201 --> 10:33.136
- You got a temper?
- I'm done with your questions.

10:33.170 --> 10:34.537
Well, that's too bad
'cause we're not done asking.

10:34.572 --> 10:36.172
Why don't we go downtown?
You might feel better

10:36.207 --> 10:37.458
about answering these
questions down there.

10:37.558 --> 10:39.518
Or you can just tell us where you were
from 5:00 to 6:00 this morning.

10:39.519 --> 10:41.478
Why do you need to know where I...

10:43.013 --> 10:45.849
Was this guy killed or something?
Because I've never even met him.

10:45.883 --> 10:47.519
Then you won't mind answering
the questions.

10:49.088 --> 10:51.256
Between 5:00 and 6:00, I was working.

10:51.291 --> 10:53.859
I pulled a double.
Plenty of people saw me.

10:53.893 --> 10:57.195
This is ridiculous.
Rick couldn't have killed Donovan.

10:57.230 --> 11:00.933
- Donovan's not even real.
- Excuse me?

11:00.967 --> 11:04.341
- He's just an app.
- An app?

11:04.431 --> 11:08.890
- You're kding.
- I-It's called "yourperfectmate."

11:08.892 --> 11:11.506
You sign up, and they give
you a virtual boyfriend.

11:11.569 --> 11:16.955
- It's like a computer or something.
- You've been texting with a robot?

11:17.079 --> 11:21.887
He tells me I look pretty every day,
and you're never home. I...

11:21.888 --> 11:24.496
I just wanted you to
get a little jealous.

11:24.497 --> 11:27.105
Looks like Stuart upgraded his image.

11:33.266 --> 11:34.804
Rick Matthews' alibi checked out.

11:34.805 --> 11:37.112
Witnesses saw him at work
at the time of the murder.

11:37.146 --> 11:38.964
I finished reading all the other texts.

11:38.965 --> 11:41.691
Nothing suspicious, but I'm
still running backgrounds.

11:41.726 --> 11:44.321
Did Frankie track down the
owners of yourperfectmate?

11:44.322 --> 11:46.916
Yeah. Crane's been employed
there for the last six months.

11:46.917 --> 11:48.992
He handled up to 40 clients at a time.

11:48.993 --> 11:52.106
- Any problems?
- They said he was a model employee.

11:52.311 --> 11:55.715
[Typing] Are you in the
market for a fake boyfriend?

11:55.800 --> 11:59.262
I don't think it's come to that yet.
I just wanna vet the app,

11:59.281 --> 12:01.136
see if any obvious
security flaws pop out.

12:01.170 --> 12:03.939
Okay, so what do you do?
You pick the kind of guy you like?

12:03.973 --> 12:06.541
Yeah. You answer questions
about what you like ...

12:06.543 --> 12:08.377
age, hobbies, interests.

12:08.411 --> 12:12.147
- I said I like horses.
- I could see you on a ranch.

12:12.181 --> 12:13.448
- Right?
- Yeah.

12:13.483 --> 12:17.953
- So it's down to polo player or cowboy.
- Mm, cowboy of ourse.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.622
Like that's even a real choice.
[Stifles laugh]

12:20.656 --> 12:22.224
Looks like they say
the most important for last ...

12:22.258 --> 12:25.017
- funny or romantic?
- Well, you can't have both.

12:25.111 --> 12:26.938
[Chuckles]
Let's go with funny.

12:26.975 --> 12:31.675
So we hit "meet my new boyfriend..."
Ooh! Hello Winston.

12:31.710 --> 12:32.912
[Chuckles] There's somebody

12:32.913 --> 12:35.502
- you could have a beer with.
- Mm-hmm?

12:35.611 --> 12:38.795
- Any luck onthe second phone?
- I found a number registered in Crane's name.

12:38.796 --> 12:40.918
Tried to call it, but
the phone's powered off.

12:40.952 --> 12:42.553
Frankie recanvassed
the crime scene and the dorm

12:42.587 --> 12:44.188
but didn't find the phone itself.

12:44.222 --> 12:46.523
Did you subpoena the carrier
for the phone records?

12:46.524 --> 12:47.291
Yeah. Still waiting.

12:47.325 --> 12:49.193
[Cell phone alert chimes]
If...

12:49.227 --> 12:51.662
- Oh, it's from Winston.
- Hmm.

12:53.365 --> 12:58.402
"I'd ri..."
Oh, Winston's the naughty.

12:58.436 --> 13:00.271
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

13:00.520 --> 13:04.441
- God, I love cowboys.
- [chuckles] Who doesn't?

13:06.611 --> 13:10.347
This is the last time
that we were out together.

13:10.382 --> 13:14.084
- Over the summer.
- You and your brother were close?

13:14.119 --> 13:17.454
Stuart was the man of the family.

13:17.489 --> 13:19.223
He was the youngest,

13:19.257 --> 13:21.225
but he always knew what to say
to make us feel better.

13:21.259 --> 13:23.694
Do you know if he had
any issues at school?

13:23.728 --> 13:28.365
No. Being broke would probably
be his biggest problem.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.969
He was paying his own way
through college.

13:32.003 --> 13:34.405
That's why he started working
for that, um...

13:34.439 --> 13:37.608
- computer boyfriend thing.
- "Yourperfectmate."

13:37.642 --> 13:41.378
We joked about it...
[chuckles]

13:41.413 --> 13:45.215
how growing up with four women
was a perfect training.

13:45.250 --> 13:46.550
He enjoyed it...

13:46.584 --> 13:50.187
- at least until they stopped paying him.
- He hadn't been paid?

13:50.221 --> 13:53.524
- No, not in weeks.
- Did he say why?

13:53.558 --> 13:57.227
The owners had promised
funding was coming in,

13:57.262 --> 14:00.397
but I told Stuart it sounded like
they were just stringing him along.

14:00.432 --> 14:02.733
- What made you think that?
- I don't know.

14:02.767 --> 14:06.834
The app has a lot of problems.
There was this one woman

14:06.869 --> 14:09.273
who had this crazy husband
who wrote terrible things to Stuart.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.342
- I think we talked to him.
- But it wasn't the first time

14:11.376 --> 14:15.419
- that something like this had happened.
- Did he have problems with other clients?

14:15.580 --> 14:20.092
Yeah. But Stuart needed the money,
so he put up with it.

14:20.719 --> 14:22.786
[Voice breaks] Do you think
that Stuart getting killed

14:22.821 --> 14:25.723
did something to do with the app?

14:25.757 --> 14:28.559
I mean, he just said
nice things to people.

14:28.593 --> 14:31.395
Why would somebody
wanna hurt him for that?

14:31.429 --> 14:36.283
We don't know exactly what happened.
But I promise you, we'll find out.

14:46.369 --> 14:49.438
[indistinct conversations]

14:51.441 --> 14:54.576
Maura.
I'm so glad you called.

14:54.611 --> 14:57.388
And the park ... wonderful idea.

14:58.017 --> 15:01.785
There's a barista who makes
a bracing espresso.

15:01.826 --> 15:04.052
- Can I bring you one?
- No, thank you.

15:04.087 --> 15:05.454
[Sighs]

15:05.488 --> 15:09.111
So... routine paperwork.

15:09.146 --> 15:12.761
- I'm sorry it needs to be notarized.
- That's fine.

15:15.765 --> 15:20.536
- I will have them for you by tomorrow.
- [Whispers] That's fine.

15:20.570 --> 15:24.806
- I should get back.
- Maura...

15:24.841 --> 15:30.179
- can't we just talk?
- I don't...

15:30.213 --> 15:34.816
I don't know how to talk to you.
I haven't since I was 14.

15:34.851 --> 15:37.452
Is this the way it's always
gonna be between us?

15:37.487 --> 15:43.225
I made a mistake.
I made a terrible mistake.

15:43.259 --> 15:45.594
But your mother and I worked it out.

15:45.628 --> 15:50.365
She... She forgave me for
the affair a long time ago.

15:50.400 --> 15:53.735
- Why can't you?
- You never asked me to.

15:54.470 --> 15:57.706
You just... acted like
nothing ever happened.

15:57.740 --> 16:01.510
[Chuckles] Well, I didn't know
how to talk to you about all that.

16:01.544 --> 16:04.580
- Well, you never tried.
- I was embarrassed.

16:04.614 --> 16:07.216
And I was traumatized...
by you.

16:07.250 --> 16:10.385
- Understand how difficult things were ...
- No, you don't!

16:10.420 --> 16:14.214
You don't, or you would
have talked to me about it.

16:14.249 --> 16:16.010
You would have told Mom that I know.

16:16.011 --> 16:18.623
You would've done something ...
something other than let me

16:18.750 --> 16:23.056
carry around this terrible secret
for all these years on my own.

16:23.112 --> 16:25.446
You and your mother
never talked about it?

16:25.510 --> 16:28.880
You asked me not to say anything.

16:28.922 --> 16:31.170
I didn't. I was scared
that Mom would leave

16:31.171 --> 16:34.543
if she knew that you asked me
to keep this secret for you.

16:35.912 --> 16:41.474
Despite everything...
I wanted you to stay together.

16:41.509 --> 16:46.347
I had...
I had no idea. [exhales]

16:47.202 --> 16:51.553
You went off to boarding school.
I was out of the country.

16:51.596 --> 16:53.196
So you thought things
would get better because we were

16:53.377 --> 16:55.940
- on different continents?
- Of course not.

16:56.113 --> 16:58.258
So how exactly was
that supposed to help?

16:58.259 --> 17:00.403
I thought things would
get easier with time.

17:00.504 --> 17:04.411
They didn't.
They got worse.

17:05.116 --> 17:13.558
Your secret became my secret.
After all these years.

17:19.150 --> 17:21.192
Maura...

17:22.656 --> 17:27.319
I am grieved that you
suffered for my stupidity.

17:27.353 --> 17:31.470
It is the one thing in my life
I most regret.

17:31.872 --> 17:34.759
And if I could go back in time
and change things,

17:34.793 --> 17:37.848
I'd do that in a heartbeat.

17:39.531 --> 17:43.782
I miss you so much.

17:44.870 --> 17:47.744
[voice breaks]
I missed you too...

17:49.151 --> 17:50.832
for so long.

17:52.258 --> 17:55.363
And then I got over it.

17:57.776 --> 18:01.440
I'll text you when the papers are ready.

18:09.937 --> 18:12.040
I wonder how many clients they have.

18:12.073 --> 18:14.007
I don't know, but I guess a lot.

18:14.040 --> 18:15.275
Not just lonely people.

18:15.308 --> 18:17.744
What about a gay guy
who's not out to his family?

18:17.777 --> 18:20.981
Or a woman at work who wants
the boss to stop hitting on her?

18:21.015 --> 18:23.968
Or maybe you just want your
mother to stop pestering

18:23.969 --> 18:26.921
you about meeting someone
nice so you can settle down?

18:28.956 --> 18:30.926
I'm just sayin'.

18:36.796 --> 18:40.033
You don't think Stuart's death had
something to do with his job here?

18:40.066 --> 18:41.803
That's what we're trying to find out.

18:41.835 --> 18:43.237
That's crazy.
Our clients loved him.

18:43.269 --> 18:44.939
Uh, we heard there were problems.

18:44.971 --> 18:46.206
Some hard feelings, maybe.

18:46.239 --> 18:48.209
Nothing that anyone would
kill someone over.

18:48.241 --> 18:50.177
How do you know?
Do you monitor every text

18:50.210 --> 18:51.979
between your employees and clients?

18:52.013 --> 18:55.149
No, but our Cyranos report any
problems, and we deal with them.

18:55.181 --> 18:58.546
- Cyranos?
- That's what we call our responders.

18:58.581 --> 19:00.655
- Cute.
- Must be hard to keep responders

19:00.688 --> 19:02.055
when you don't pay 'em
for several weeks.

19:02.088 --> 19:03.657
What are you talking about?

19:03.690 --> 19:07.060
[Sighs] Our investor keeps
delaying the new funding.

19:07.094 --> 19:10.030
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't want you to worry.

19:10.064 --> 19:11.632
We heard he was pretty upset about it.

19:11.665 --> 19:14.067
I assured him that he would
be paid, every cent.

19:14.101 --> 19:15.268
Would you mind telling us
where you were

19:15.302 --> 19:18.211
- between 5:00 and 6:00 this morning?
- He was right here.

19:18.246 --> 19:20.007
We both were.
We practically live here.

19:20.040 --> 19:23.076
Though it's obvious we're not
talking as often as we should be.

19:23.110 --> 19:26.014
There's security footage
if you want to see it.

19:26.046 --> 19:29.282
We do. These problems that Stuart
was having ... what happened?

19:29.315 --> 19:31.952
[Sighs] A woman sent
some inappropriate pictures.

19:31.986 --> 19:34.122
Another tried to meet,
but our system keeps

19:34.154 --> 19:36.089
client and responder
information anonymous.

19:36.123 --> 19:38.459
Those conversations with former
clients weren't on his phone.

19:38.492 --> 19:41.962
No, but we have them archived
on our servers.

19:41.996 --> 19:44.832
We'll need access to that data ...
all your data, as a matter of fact.

19:46.662 --> 19:48.858
[Telephone rings in distance]

19:53.940 --> 19:59.012
- So, how'd it go?
- I did it. I talked to him.

19:59.046 --> 20:03.905
- Yeah? How do you feel?
- Honestly, I don't feel any different.

20:03.940 --> 20:06.054
I thought I'd be
much more relieved,

20:06.086 --> 20:08.321
like some big burden had been lifted.

20:08.354 --> 20:10.892
- Maybe it has.
- Doesn't feel like it has.

20:10.924 --> 20:14.044
Okay, well, you said that keeping
your father's secret is the

20:14.045 --> 20:17.164
reason that you break out in
hives when you tell a lie, right?

20:17.198 --> 20:19.132
It's a working hypothesis.

20:19.165 --> 20:22.002
Okay, so let's test it out.
Lie to me.

20:22.036 --> 20:24.602
- What?
- Yeah. Say something.

20:24.637 --> 20:26.207
Anything.
But make it big, so it counts.

20:26.239 --> 20:28.709
And then we'll see
if you break out in hives.

20:28.742 --> 20:30.485
- Jane ...
- Lie to me!

20:40.654 --> 20:43.341
I really like your new jacket.
[Gasps]

20:43.402 --> 20:45.126
Fringe has always been
one of my favorites.

20:45.159 --> 20:48.045
- Are you itchy?
- Not yet.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.397
[Cell phone buzzes]
Mnh. [Beep]

20:49.430 --> 20:51.899
All right. I gotta go.
But this is good.

20:51.931 --> 20:54.067
<i>Keep lying, all right?
Keep it up.</i>

20:54.101 --> 20:55.803
Maybe you've had
a breakthrough or something.

20:55.835 --> 20:57.371
Oh, hey.
The whole fringe jacket thing?

20:57.403 --> 21:00.504
I'm not keeping it.
I was just messing with you.

21:03.510 --> 21:07.381
Jane, I love it
when you play pranks on me.

21:10.985 --> 21:12.320
Yeah, I'll get some chocolates.

21:12.353 --> 21:14.488
Or ... Or maybe flowers.
Flowers are better, right?

21:14.521 --> 21:18.024
Vince, just tell Kiki you're sorry.

21:18.307 --> 21:20.593
Couples argue.
It's normal.

21:20.628 --> 21:22.213
Well, Kiki and I don't.
Mostly, we laugh.

21:22.246 --> 21:26.027
This is our first argument. I wanna
make sure the apology is right.

21:26.062 --> 21:27.618
What did you fight over anyway?

21:27.651 --> 21:29.487
- It was so stupid.
- Huh.

21:29.519 --> 21:32.038
She kept talking about
this wedding she was looking

21:32.039 --> 21:34.557
forward to going to,
and she didn't invite me.

21:34.591 --> 21:37.460
- Did you offer to take her?
- No!

21:37.494 --> 21:39.430
Obviously, she didn't want me there.

21:39.462 --> 21:42.767
And I got annoyed and said
some things I wish I hadn't.

21:42.799 --> 21:44.701
Oh, so you got your feelings hurt?

21:44.735 --> 21:49.525
- Just tell her.
- I will.

21:50.173 --> 21:52.242
[Mouth full] Maybe over
a really nice bottle of wine.

21:55.511 --> 21:58.782
Uh... or over a burger and fries.

21:58.815 --> 22:03.286
Hey, Kiki. You're looking
gorgeous as always.

22:03.319 --> 22:06.256
[Chuckles] Thank you, Angela.
It's nice to see you.

22:06.289 --> 22:08.158
<i>Nice to see you, too.</i>

22:08.191 --> 22:12.496
So, uh, your timing is perfect
because Vince was just telling me

22:12.528 --> 22:16.767
how he had something very important
he wanted to talk to you about.

22:16.799 --> 22:20.171
Adiós!
[Chuckles]

22:20.203 --> 22:24.075
I stopped by the station.
They said I'd find you here.

22:24.107 --> 22:25.475
Thank you.

22:25.508 --> 22:28.778
Well, I thought we were
going for more salads.

22:28.812 --> 22:30.596
[Chuckles] Oh.
What can I tell you?

22:30.597 --> 22:32.151
I'm a work in progress.
[Chuckles]

22:32.214 --> 22:36.253
Besides, more salads doesn't
necessarily mean fewer burgers.

22:36.286 --> 22:38.655
[Chuckles]

22:38.745 --> 22:41.491
I, uh, I just wanted to
apologize for the other night.

22:41.525 --> 22:43.427
I'm not sure exactly what happened ...

22:43.459 --> 22:45.161
You don't have to apologize. I do.

22:45.194 --> 22:48.798
[Sighs] Were you upset about
me going to the wedding?

22:48.832 --> 22:51.735
I was...

22:51.767 --> 22:54.104
disappointed you didn't
ask me to come along.

22:54.138 --> 22:55.439
Well... [sighs]

22:55.471 --> 22:58.374
I just thought you wanted
to take things slower.

22:58.408 --> 22:59.642
Why would you think that?

22:59.676 --> 23:03.446
Well, because you haven't
introduced me to any of your friends.

23:03.479 --> 23:07.718
I mean, except for Angela, and
that was just because we were here.

23:07.750 --> 23:11.522
Of course I want you to meet my
friends, and they are dying to meet you.

23:11.555 --> 23:13.123
Oh, that's nice.

23:13.157 --> 23:15.359
Maybe I'll throw a little
get-together tomorrow night.

23:15.392 --> 23:19.097
- Oh, no, you don't have to do that.
- Oh, I want to... very much.

23:20.530 --> 23:23.200
Accept my apology?

23:24.901 --> 23:27.238
- You want a burger?
- [Mouth full] I'd love one.

23:27.270 --> 23:29.839
[Both laugh]

23:31.708 --> 23:32.942
Hey, you free tomorrow night?

23:32.976 --> 23:34.745
Yes. Anything to get me out
of Frankie's apartment.

23:34.777 --> 23:38.482
- Are you two at each other's throats?
- Yeah, he's just, you know... [sighs]

23:38.515 --> 23:40.918
"Don't drink my beer."
"Put your pizza box away."

23:40.950 --> 23:43.720
- He's bossier than Ma.
- Well, it is his apartment.

23:43.754 --> 23:45.890
Oh, that's nice.
Take his side.

23:45.922 --> 23:49.226
- What's tomorrow night?
- You wanna meet Kiki?

23:49.258 --> 23:51.228
Well, it's about time!

23:51.260 --> 23:52.695
- Hey, Jane?
- Yeah.

23:52.728 --> 23:56.366
Uh, we've been going through the
data we got from yourperfectmate.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.235
Anything on Stuart's former clients?

23:58.267 --> 24:00.871
Well, nothing suspicious,
but we noticed something.

24:00.903 --> 24:02.906
Two of his clients mentioned
being burglarized

24:02.940 --> 24:04.807
shortly after they
began texting with him.

24:04.841 --> 24:08.179
Both times, the women told Crane
they'd be away from home

24:08.211 --> 24:09.546
the night someone broke in.

24:09.580 --> 24:12.615
Oh, so they text him the information,
and then he uses it to rob them.

24:12.649 --> 24:15.685
Except that it's probably not Stuart.
We checked the client data

24:15.719 --> 24:17.488
and cross-indexed it
with police records.

24:17.520 --> 24:18.922
There have been 27 burglaries reported

24:18.956 --> 24:21.525
by yourperfectmate clients
over the last three months,

24:21.557 --> 24:22.825
and they all follow the same pattern.

24:22.859 --> 24:26.197
They target empty homes
and unattended vehicles.

24:26.229 --> 24:28.399
And they're all assigned
to different responders.

24:28.431 --> 24:29.666
Who has access to the company's data?

24:29.700 --> 24:31.267
Nina: Unfortunately, a lot of people.

24:31.301 --> 24:34.537
We ran their employee list through
our database, but no one popped.

24:34.571 --> 24:35.940
We're gonna check them out one by one,

24:35.972 --> 24:38.408
- but it's gonna take some time.
- I have an idea.

24:38.441 --> 24:40.544
Do you still have the naughty cowboy?

24:40.576 --> 24:43.780
Winston? At your service.

24:43.814 --> 24:46.983
- Who's Winston?
- Nina's fake boyfriend. [Scoffs]

24:47.017 --> 24:50.821
And I am texting him how my
brother... [inhales sharply]

24:50.853 --> 24:54.225
leaves his electric guitars
in his van at night.

24:54.257 --> 24:58.763
- What guitars?
- The expensive ones.

25:03.799 --> 25:07.204
[Car door opens and closes]

25:15.612 --> 25:17.448
[Metal clanks]

25:17.480 --> 25:21.484
Boston P.D.!
Turn around!

25:24.488 --> 25:25.855
[Tool clanks]

25:25.889 --> 25:28.025
This is the part where you put
your hands on your head.

25:31.894 --> 25:33.263
[Holsters gun]

25:38.501 --> 25:39.702
[Files thud]

25:39.736 --> 25:42.039
27 burglaries.
You've been busy, Evan.

25:42.072 --> 25:44.808
I don't know what you're talking about.

25:44.841 --> 25:46.343
We caught you red-handed.

25:46.375 --> 25:48.011
All I did was break into one empty van.

25:48.045 --> 25:51.515
Oh. So this had nothing to do
with a text that was sent

25:51.547 --> 25:52.982
by a yourperfectmate client?

25:53.016 --> 25:55.719
Where you just happen to be
a programmer.

25:55.751 --> 25:57.754
That van belonged
to one of our users?

25:57.787 --> 25:59.757
Wow. That's a hell
of a coincidence.

25:59.789 --> 26:02.725
Especially given that every one
of these burglaries

26:02.758 --> 26:04.928
also involves
a yourperfectmate client.

26:04.960 --> 26:09.032
- I don't know anything about those.
- Oh, that's good...

26:09.065 --> 26:11.302
because we compiled a list
of everything that was stolen.

26:11.334 --> 26:13.036
We're just waiting on a warrant
for your apartment.

26:13.069 --> 26:15.738
- Wonder what we'll find in there.
- Mm.

26:15.771 --> 26:19.575
<i>Frankie: Help us, and we'll talk to the D.A.</i>

26:19.609 --> 26:22.613
Okay.
Maybe I took advantage

26:22.645 --> 26:24.847
of my access to some user information.

26:24.881 --> 26:26.850
<i>I mean, what are
these women thinking,</i>

26:26.882 --> 26:29.585
telling some total stranger
all about their personal lives?

26:29.619 --> 26:32.656
You know, if it wasn't me,
it would've been somebody else.

26:32.689 --> 26:34.292
But it was you.

26:35.558 --> 26:37.493
- You have help?
- No.

26:37.526 --> 26:38.862
It's hard to believe
you could've pulled this off

26:38.894 --> 26:40.064
without anyone else catching on.

26:40.096 --> 26:43.334
Who? The owners?
Like they'd ever notice.

26:43.366 --> 26:45.068
Well, a Cyrano might've figured it out.

26:45.102 --> 26:47.403
Someone like Stuart Crane?
Maybe he wanted a piece?

26:47.437 --> 26:50.641
Or confronted you about
stealing from his clients?

26:50.673 --> 26:53.610
Stuart Crane?
What's he got to do with this?

26:53.642 --> 26:55.078
That's what we wanna know.

26:55.112 --> 26:58.015
- Something happen to him?
- He was murdered.

26:58.447 --> 27:03.953
Wait... you think... I had
something to do with this.

27:03.987 --> 27:06.556
- Did you?
- I barely knew the guy. Okay? I ...

27:06.590 --> 27:08.425
If you know anything,
you need to tell us.

27:08.458 --> 27:09.759
This is serious, Evan.

27:09.793 --> 27:12.563
[Exhales]

27:12.595 --> 27:15.498
Yeah, I get that. Um...

27:15.532 --> 27:20.738
I think I'd like a lawyer now.
[Pen clicks]

27:22.605 --> 27:23.973
[Ice cubes rattling]

27:30.747 --> 27:33.851
Here you go.
Signed and notarized.

27:33.883 --> 27:37.488
- I hope this wasn't too much trouble.
- Not at all.

27:37.520 --> 27:38.755
Maura, I really am sorry.

27:38.788 --> 27:41.157
I may never be able
to express how much.

27:41.190 --> 27:44.361
Thank you.

27:46.830 --> 27:48.832
You're... probably busy,

27:48.864 --> 27:52.735
but a colleague of mine is
speaking this evening on the

27:52.736 --> 27:56.606
development of the Khmuic
tribes of, uh, Thailand and Laos.

27:56.640 --> 27:59.743
The Khmu language is
wonderfully rhythmic.

27:59.776 --> 28:01.844
Yes. Yes, it is.

28:01.878 --> 28:04.948
And Dr. Moore is quite engaging.

28:04.980 --> 28:07.884
We used to enjoy the occasional
anthropology lecture, didn't we?

28:07.918 --> 28:10.053
We did.

28:10.085 --> 28:13.123
Maura, I know I may never
be able to repair

28:13.155 --> 28:16.058
the schism between us,
but perhaps tonight

28:16.092 --> 28:18.996
we can just simply be
two ordinary adults

28:19.028 --> 28:22.165
attending a lecture
on Southeast Asian culture?

28:22.199 --> 28:26.870
I appreciate the invitation,
but I can't.

28:26.902 --> 28:31.741
Well...
perhaps next time I'm in town.

28:31.775 --> 28:35.877
- Have a safe trip.
- Thank you.

28:38.748 --> 28:40.985
Goodbye, Maura.

28:48.691 --> 28:51.828
[Sighs deeply]
Can I ask you something?

28:51.862 --> 28:55.098
You wanna know why
I don't want to repair

28:55.131 --> 28:58.567
my relationship with my
father, even though he

28:58.568 --> 29:02.004
is reaching out and
attempting to bridge the chasm

29:02.037 --> 29:05.642
that has built up between the two of us
over the past two decades.

29:05.674 --> 29:07.543
Actually, I was gonna ask you

29:07.576 --> 29:10.780
if you enjoyed those
lectures as a young girl.

29:10.814 --> 29:13.182
Oh. Yes.
They were fascinating.

29:13.216 --> 29:16.853
Sounds like a snooze fest to me.
[Chuckles]

29:16.886 --> 29:19.955
But since you did bring
it up, why don't you

29:19.956 --> 29:23.025
wanna repair your
relationship with your father?

29:23.058 --> 29:25.161
He lives his life.
I live mine.

29:25.194 --> 29:28.130
That's how it's been
ever since he cheated.

29:28.163 --> 29:30.933
So I've just ...
I've come to accept it.

29:30.967 --> 29:33.504
You know, when your kids are little,

29:33.536 --> 29:38.075
they look up to you.
You're their whole world.

29:38.107 --> 29:40.710
But, uh, parents are not perfect.

29:40.744 --> 29:44.514
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not excusing what your father did.

29:44.547 --> 29:47.851
He made a mistake, and one
that has caused you so much...

29:47.883 --> 29:52.756
pain and... anger.

29:52.788 --> 29:57.261
- Why hold on to that, Maura?
- At this point,

29:57.294 --> 29:59.796
I'm not certain I know how to let it go.

29:59.828 --> 30:03.449
Well, you've lived with
it for so long. maybe you

30:03.450 --> 30:07.071
should try something
different and see what happens.

30:09.171 --> 30:11.607
Baby steps.

30:15.312 --> 30:17.848
[Elevator bell dings]
Are you sure we're talking about ma?

30:17.881 --> 30:19.016
'Cause that's
shockingly rational advice.

30:19.048 --> 30:21.084
Well, your mother can be very rational.

30:21.116 --> 30:23.052
We're talking about the same person

30:23.085 --> 30:25.889
who thinks she started
the Led Zeppelin riot in 1975?

30:25.921 --> 30:27.658
[Chuckles]
Well, we can't prove she didn't.

30:27.690 --> 30:30.059
Okay, did you find anything
that links Evan Ballard

30:30.093 --> 30:32.930
- to Stuart's murder?
- No, the rubber on the boots

30:32.962 --> 30:34.263
that we found
in the suspect's apartment

30:34.296 --> 30:35.798
was not a match to what
we found on the fingers.

30:35.832 --> 30:37.167
- I'm still waiting ...
- Jane.

30:37.200 --> 30:40.269
Stuart's personal cell phone
just showed up online.

30:40.303 --> 30:41.271
Can we track it?

30:41.304 --> 30:43.172
We don't have a warrant
for G.P.S. data yet,

30:43.206 --> 30:45.742
but whoever has the phone
is using the camera.

30:45.775 --> 30:49.233
Photos are uploading automatically
to Stuart's cloud storage.

30:49.343 --> 30:52.038
[Mouse clicking] Well, at
least he didn't erase 'em.

30:52.282 --> 30:55.319
<i>Nina: Looks pretty run down.
Maybe a homeless person picked it up?</i>

30:55.352 --> 30:59.289
That looks like...
the lip of a skateboard at the bottom,

30:59.322 --> 31:03.193
But... that's not any skate park
I know. Where is that?

31:05.961 --> 31:08.664
<i>- Isotria medeoloides.
- You're so what?</i>

31:08.698 --> 31:12.069
The small whorled pogonia.
It's a rare native plant.

31:12.102 --> 31:14.371
I saw some on my hike
through Franklin Park.

31:14.403 --> 31:16.205
And if I recall correctly,

31:16.238 --> 31:19.343
there was an old
maintenance area nearby.

31:19.375 --> 31:21.010
Okay, well, let's assume
you recall correctly.

31:21.044 --> 31:23.947
- How do we get there?
- Off the main path,

31:23.979 --> 31:25.681
you would travel approximately
40 degrees due West ...

31:25.715 --> 31:29.823
- Nope.
- Okay. Oh, if you start where the butterflies

31:29.858 --> 31:31.688
- nest every spring ...
- How do I know where the butterflies nest?!

31:31.720 --> 31:33.690
Well, you would know if you went
on these hikes with me.

31:33.722 --> 31:36.092
- Who wants to go on a hike with ...
- I don't wanna be that person,

31:36.125 --> 31:38.027
but we only have a location
if the phone stays on.

31:38.061 --> 31:42.099
Wish granted! We're going on a hike.
Lead the way.

31:42.332 --> 31:46.170
- My shoes are suede.
- Keep walking.

31:53.876 --> 31:56.379
<i>This photo was uploaded
two minutes ago, </i>

31:56.412 --> 31:58.280
and that building's
in the background.

31:58.314 --> 31:59.916
All right, backup's on the way,
but I don't wanna

31:59.949 --> 32:01.250
risk losing them.
You wanna go around back?

32:01.284 --> 32:03.152
- Okay.
- You stay here.

32:03.186 --> 32:07.160
<i>Boy: What do you want to do?
[Skateboard clatters]</i>

32:10.293 --> 32:13.729
[Indistinct conversations]

32:13.763 --> 32:15.999
<i>Boy: All right, all right!
I got next, though!</i>

32:16.032 --> 32:18.035
[Boy speaks indistinctly]

32:18.067 --> 32:20.970
Boston P.D. You know you guys
aren't supposed to be here.

32:21.004 --> 32:22.406
We're not bothering anybody, officer.

32:22.439 --> 32:25.208
It's detective.
Let me see your cell phones.

32:25.240 --> 32:27.777
- Why?
- 'Cause I said so.

32:27.811 --> 32:30.880
- Are we under arrest?
- You keep acting like this, you might be.

32:30.913 --> 32:33.215
Well, um, I don't see a warrant.

32:33.248 --> 32:37.286
So unless you can prove probable
cause or an imminent threat,

32:37.319 --> 32:38.854
we don't have to show you anything.

32:38.888 --> 32:41.324
That's cute. That's really good.
What, you a lawyer?

32:41.356 --> 32:44.326
It's called reddit, detective.
We know our rights.

32:44.360 --> 32:47.197
- Let me explain to you about your rights ...
- Maura: Jane.

32:48.965 --> 32:51.068
[Whispers] Excuse me.

32:52.401 --> 32:54.671
Look.

32:56.072 --> 32:58.775
Okay, you know what?
Scratch the cell phones.

32:58.807 --> 33:00.943
I just need to see the moron
who took this.

33:04.146 --> 33:06.683
[Skateboard drops]

33:10.085 --> 33:12.421
[Chain rattles]
Uhh!

33:12.455 --> 33:14.358
Hands behind your back.
[Grunts]

33:15.859 --> 33:18.161
[Handcuffs click]

33:18.193 --> 33:20.763
Holiday's a badass!

33:24.867 --> 33:27.236
Put that on reddit.

33:31.256 --> 33:32.524
You get anything from Evan Ballard?

33:32.558 --> 33:34.261
Lawyer's still in with him.
[Sighs]

33:34.293 --> 33:35.961
Hey, Kiki's coming
into the Robber tonight.

33:35.994 --> 33:37.997
Figured it's time for her
to meet everyone.

33:38.031 --> 33:39.299
Can you make it?

33:39.331 --> 33:42.201
Sure. You're introducing her
to all of us at once?

33:42.234 --> 33:45.672
- Brave man.
- [Scoffs] Yeah.

33:45.705 --> 33:48.407
Hey, what's wrong?
You're not having second

33:48.408 --> 33:51.278
- thoughts about Kiki, are you?
- Oh, no, no. Kiki's great.

33:51.311 --> 33:54.013
It's the healthiest relationship
I've had in...

33:54.046 --> 33:55.281
maybe ever.

33:55.314 --> 33:57.149
But now that she's about
to meet the family,

33:57.183 --> 34:01.221
it's making me realize I...
I really wanna keep her around.

34:01.253 --> 34:04.256
So what's the problem?

34:04.290 --> 34:07.260
Well, my track record
with women suggests

34:07.292 --> 34:09.228
that the odds of this
working out aren't so great.

34:09.261 --> 34:11.998
Everyone's track record is terrible
until they meet the one that works.

34:12.031 --> 34:15.302
- When'd you get so smart?
- Ah, I've always been smart. [Laughs]

34:15.335 --> 34:18.205
Not that anyone would notice.

34:23.308 --> 34:26.045
[Door closes]
So far, the kid's sticking to his story.

34:26.078 --> 34:28.246
Says he was hanging out
on Prescott Trail yesterday

34:28.281 --> 34:30.150
around 6:00, found
the cell phone in the dirt.

34:30.183 --> 34:31.685
And thought what, "hey, free phone"?

34:31.717 --> 34:33.686
Pretty much.
And he figured out the password

34:33.719 --> 34:36.554
- by the finger smudges on the screen.
- Smart.

34:36.589 --> 34:38.123
That's not the first word
I'd use to describe him,

34:38.156 --> 34:41.393
but he says that he didn't
see anyone or anything,

34:41.427 --> 34:43.246
- and that includes our body.
- You believe him?

34:43.306 --> 34:45.697
I'm starting to, yeah.
Stealing a cell phone

34:45.699 --> 34:49.920
hardly seems like a motive
for murder. [Cell phone buzzes]

34:50.268 --> 34:52.205
Evan Ballard's lawyer wants to talk.

34:52.237 --> 34:54.473
- You think he's gonna cop to the killing?
- I doubt it.

34:54.507 --> 34:57.476
He seemed genuinely surprised
when he heard Stuart was dead.

34:57.509 --> 34:59.545
So we have two thieves and no killer.

34:59.578 --> 35:04.251
- Nina get anything off that phone?
- She's working on it.

35:05.384 --> 35:06.986
[Door opens]

35:07.020 --> 35:10.255
- Hey. What do you got?
- I went through Stuart's phone.

35:10.288 --> 35:11.657
Mostly friends and family,

35:11.690 --> 35:13.726
but I also found some texts
from Heather Matthews.

35:13.759 --> 35:15.728
The client with the jealous husband?

35:15.761 --> 35:18.197
Her messages to Stuart
started a week ago

35:18.230 --> 35:19.665
and became increasingly agitated.

35:19.699 --> 35:22.634
They suddenly stopped yesterday.
Look at this.

35:22.668 --> 35:24.436
"I don't understand
why you're ignoring me.

35:24.469 --> 35:26.105
I know you were home yesterday."

35:26.139 --> 35:27.406
That sounds like she might've
been stalking him.

35:27.441 --> 35:29.208
- Mm.
- What do we have on her?

35:29.241 --> 35:32.479
No criminal record, but her
bank account shows a withdrawal

35:32.511 --> 35:34.380
of $2,500 from savings a week ago.

35:34.413 --> 35:35.781
Might explain that
first edition "Don Juan"

35:35.815 --> 35:38.184
- you found in Stuart's dorm.
- Well, maybe it was a gift.

35:38.217 --> 35:40.787
Heather also doesn't have much
of an online presence,

35:40.819 --> 35:41.920
but this may be why ...

35:41.955 --> 35:44.324
she's got three social media
accounts that were closed

35:44.357 --> 35:46.226
- for inappropriate and abusive conduct.
- Mm.

35:46.259 --> 35:48.908
- Evan Ballard's lawyer wants to deal.
- He know something about the murder?

35:48.943 --> 35:51.296
Evan admitted that he sold
information to several yourperfectmate

35:51.297 --> 35:54.367
clients who wanted to learn the
identities of their online boyfriends.

35:54.400 --> 35:55.568
Was one of them Heather Matthews?

35:55.601 --> 35:57.404
It was.
That's why he lawyered up.

35:57.436 --> 35:59.739
Didn't want to be charged as
an accessory to murder.

35:59.772 --> 36:02.743
- We gotta bring her in.
- I'll get Jane.

36:06.910 --> 36:09.078
[Dog barking]

36:09.111 --> 36:12.148
Wait a second.

36:13.582 --> 36:15.952
Gasoline.

36:17.986 --> 36:20.089
[Muffled shouting]

36:20.123 --> 36:21.525
She's gonna torch the place.

36:22.457 --> 36:25.326
Get the front. I'll go around back.
[Lighter clicks]

36:25.361 --> 36:28.232
[Muffled whimpering]
Shit.

36:34.270 --> 36:35.639
Boston P.D.!
Don't move!

36:35.672 --> 36:38.542
Get out.

36:40.009 --> 36:42.445
Put the lighter up.
[Muffled whimpering]

36:42.477 --> 36:44.647
He said he was going to leave me.

36:44.681 --> 36:46.650
Why does everyone wanna leave me?

36:46.683 --> 36:48.518
Heather, listen to me, okay?

36:48.551 --> 36:52.421
- I understand that this is hard for you.
- I thought Stuart loved me.

36:52.455 --> 36:55.257
But then he told me it wasn't real.

36:55.290 --> 36:58.127
He didn't even appreciate the book.

36:58.161 --> 37:00.663
- And it was a very thoughtful gift.
- It was perfect!

37:00.696 --> 37:02.998
<i>I followed him onto the trail
because...</i>

37:03.031 --> 37:06.903
<i>I wanted him to understand
how much I cared.</i>

37:07.569 --> 37:11.385
He told me to leave him alone.
[Breathing heavily]

37:11.422 --> 37:13.143
<i>Jane: Wait, wait, wait.
Hey, hey, hey.</i>

37:13.176 --> 37:14.377
Look at me. Look at me.

37:14.410 --> 37:17.379
Look at me, okay?

37:17.413 --> 37:21.117
I know that you did not want
to hurt Stuart. Okay?

37:21.149 --> 37:22.551
Just like I know you
don't wanna do this.

37:22.585 --> 37:25.021
I know you don't wanna
hurt Rick. Okay?

37:25.053 --> 37:28.357
- I don't wanna hurt anyone.
- Okay.

37:28.390 --> 37:31.260
But nobody leaves me.

37:32.594 --> 37:34.665
No!

37:36.332 --> 37:38.368
[Lighter clicks]

37:38.401 --> 37:40.303
Nice catch.

37:42.205 --> 37:44.811
<i>[Heather crying]
Easy. Take it easy.</i>

37:44.846 --> 37:48.344
<i>Put your hands behind your back.
It's gonna be okay.</i>

37:48.377 --> 37:51.679
[Handcuffs click]

37:55.151 --> 37:57.721
- You ready to go?
- Mm-hmm. [Compact clicks]

37:57.754 --> 38:00.991
- Oh, no.
- What? I'm not messing with you.

38:01.024 --> 38:04.326
- Jane.
- Okay, I'm messing with you a little bit.

38:04.359 --> 38:06.662
I got gasoline on my jacket,

38:06.696 --> 38:10.266
and luckily, I had
this... at... my chair.

38:10.299 --> 38:12.435
<i>[Sighs] Oh, goodness.
[Compact clatters]</i>

38:12.468 --> 38:16.606
All right. Well, before we go...
[Groans]

38:16.638 --> 38:19.508
there is something
that I wanted to say.

38:19.542 --> 38:22.746
[Sighs] Are you gonna make
some sort of proclamation?

38:27.116 --> 38:28.451
I am who I am

38:28.484 --> 38:30.754
because of the things
that have happened in my life,

38:30.786 --> 38:34.156
- the good and the bad.
- Sounds very proclamation-y.

38:34.190 --> 38:36.092
<i>My relationships with my family</i>

38:36.125 --> 38:38.128
have been...
challenging at times,

38:38.161 --> 38:41.698
and they've certainly had
a significant influence.

38:41.730 --> 38:45.567
But other people have been
just as important.

38:45.600 --> 38:48.637
Do you mean super...smart
and funny people

38:48.670 --> 38:53.243
that don't mind borrowing
leftovers from your fridge?

38:53.276 --> 38:56.312
[Chuckles] If it wasn't for you, Jane,
and your family,

38:56.344 --> 38:59.482
I think I would probably be
one of those people

38:59.515 --> 39:02.619
that's sitting home on a Friday night,
reading medical journals.

39:02.652 --> 39:04.788
And instead,
I'm heading out for the evening,

39:04.821 --> 39:05.889
surrounded by friends.

39:05.922 --> 39:09.592
Oh, please. You love
those medical journals!

39:09.625 --> 39:12.160
That's true.
But you all keep me so busy,

39:12.161 --> 39:16.565
- I never run out of new ones.
- In that case, you're welcome.

39:17.533 --> 39:19.435
Now let's go!

39:19.469 --> 39:21.271
[Sighs]
Please don't do that in public.

39:21.303 --> 39:22.704
I can't help it!

39:22.737 --> 39:26.076
Jane, that fringe is gonna
scratch your cornea.

39:26.109 --> 39:31.381
Or yours, so stay back!
I'll just do it to the car.

39:31.413 --> 39:34.216
I promise...
but keep your distance!

39:34.250 --> 39:38.288
[Making swishing sounds]

39:38.321 --> 39:41.723
[Laughs]
Oh, my god.

<i> Cathy Heller:
# Remember when we started... #</i>

39:44.527 --> 39:46.529
[Laughs]
...and that's when I realized

39:46.562 --> 39:48.198
the towel was stuck
in the elevator door.

39:48.230 --> 39:49.431
- No!
- Yes!

39:49.464 --> 39:51.800
- So what did you do?
- So I stood up straight

39:51.833 --> 39:55.101
and I saluted the very
shocked army captain and said,

39:55.136 --> 39:59.021
"just doing my part for the
enlisted men, sir." [Laughter]

40:00.609 --> 40:02.711
- I'll get the next round.
- Oh, I'll get 'em.

40:02.745 --> 40:04.781
No, let me.
I'm in good with the owner.

40:04.814 --> 40:07.783
Besides, when will you all
have time to talk about me?

40:07.817 --> 40:09.319
[Chuckles]

40:09.352 --> 40:11.888
<i>- # for you #
- Okay, she's fantastic.</i>

40:11.920 --> 40:14.524
Why have you been
hiding her all this time?

40:14.556 --> 40:16.493
I was afraid you all might
scare her off.

40:16.526 --> 40:19.194
- Mm.
- Oh, not a chance. She loves us.

40:19.227 --> 40:20.462
And we love her.

40:20.495 --> 40:21.897
I'm so happy I had a chance to meet her.

40:21.931 --> 40:24.134
- I'm sorry I have to leave.
- I'm just happy you were here.

40:24.167 --> 40:25.668
[Whispers] Thank you.

40:25.701 --> 40:27.871
You sure you don't wanna take
a twirl in the fringe jacket?

40:27.904 --> 40:31.541
I'm seriously tempted,
but I think I'm okay.

40:31.573 --> 40:33.408
All right.
But just so you know,

40:33.442 --> 40:35.344
the fringe is always here for you.

40:35.377 --> 40:38.347
Okay. Thanks.

Cam, I'll catch up with you
after the lecture,

40:58.682 --> 41:00.554
- if that's okay?
- Mm-hmm.

41:02.805 --> 41:03.839
As it turns out,

41:03.873 --> 41:07.777
I couldn't resist the pull
of a Dr. Moore lecture.

41:07.810 --> 41:10.813
Well, I can hardly blame you.
You're only human.

41:10.846 --> 41:14.316
- Shall we?
- Sure.

41:14.350 --> 41:16.920
Mm.
One thing I should mention

41:16.953 --> 41:20.623
- in the interest of full disclosure...
- What's that?

41:20.656 --> 41:24.826
I actually find the Eastern Khmu dialect

41:24.859 --> 41:28.264
- more interesting than the Western Khmu.
- Oh, that's ridiculous.

41:28.297 --> 41:31.467
Oh, no, no.
Narrow registration, tonal palate.
