Well, welcome to Friends of Heaven.
I'm Pastor Wayne.

03:53.316 --> 03:55.652
As some of you know,
I like to start out our grief circle

03:55.735 --> 03:58.529
by talking about a loss I lived through
that got me into this work.

04:00.156 --> 04:03.201
My aunt fell down a flight of stairs
and cracked her head open and bled out

04:03.284 --> 04:05.203
as her five-year-old son watched,

04:05.286 --> 04:07.747
and I was the one that asked her
to get me a soda from the basement.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.166
So, I live with that.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.669
And that's a little something about me.

04:13.211 --> 04:14.462
Oh, my God.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.506
[Wayne] I appreciate that.

04:16.589 --> 04:19.550
Is there a loss you've had
that you'd like to share with us today?

04:20.301 --> 04:21.302
[Judy] Uh...

04:22.053 --> 04:25.431
Yeah. I lost my fiancé eight weeks ago.

04:26.766 --> 04:27.600
Um...

04:27.684 --> 04:28.977
It was really sudden.

04:29.060 --> 04:32.438
One minute, we were eating dinner
and then the next, he was gone.

04:33.898 --> 04:35.191
[nurse] I'm so sorry.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.902

-Yeah. He was 44.

04:43.866 --> 04:46.202
Oh, that sucks. Sorry.

04:46.452 --> 04:47.287
Thank you.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.248
[Wayne] Thank you for sharing that.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.959
So, last week, we started talking about...

04:53.918 --> 04:54.836
the F-word.

04:57.630 --> 04:58.506
Forgiveness.

04:59.048 --> 05:02.927
Forgiveness can be very difficult,
and it can take time, even a lifetime.

05:03.011 --> 05:06.973
But no matter what the circumstances,
everyone is deserving of forgiveness.

05:07.557 --> 05:08.891
You really think that?

05:09.392 --> 05:10.810
Jesus thought that.

05:10.893 --> 05:12.020
[woman] Amen.

05:12.103 --> 05:13.646
Um, excuse me. Um...

05:14.188 --> 05:16.649
How do you forgive someone
who hits your husband with their car,

05:16.733 --> 05:20.278
and then drives away, leaving him
to bleed to death on the side of the road?

05:20.361 --> 05:21.362
How do you forgive that?

05:29.370 --> 05:30.371
No, that's it.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.624
Don't really wanna get into it,
so someone else can go.

-[inhales sharply]
-[Wayne] At your own pace.

05:36.294 --> 05:39.839
It's okay to feel whatever you're feeling,
sad, angry, defensive--

I'm not defensive. Okay?

05:45.345 --> 05:46.220
I'm tired.

05:46.512 --> 05:47.722
I'm tired, too.

05:50.099 --> 05:51.392
Can you tell us more about that?

05:51.851 --> 05:53.519
Oh, yeah. I just haven't been sleeping.

05:54.520 --> 05:58.316
You know, I've never been
a very good sleeper, anyway, but...

05:59.484 --> 06:01.861
since Ted died, not at all.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.114
I mean, not naturally, anyway, but...

06:05.198 --> 06:06.240
[clears throat]

06:06.366 --> 06:07.575
And I'm not gonna take pills.

06:08.242 --> 06:12.789
I was not a pill person
and I have two kids, two boys, who...

06:12.997 --> 06:16.667
who need me, and so,
I'm not gonna be one of those, like,

06:17.335 --> 06:21.005

06:28.262 --> 06:30.139

06:30.515 --> 06:31.474

07:06.759 --> 07:08.219
It's just so not fair.

07:08.594 --> 07:10.721

Why didn't...

07:10.930 --> 07:13.516
Tyler's dad die? Rick.
That guy's a twatwaffle.

07:14.767 --> 07:15.726

Oh, sweetie, I know, but we just can't
do that anymore, okay?

07:36.456 --> 07:38.166
I mean, it's been three months, and...

07:38.541 --> 07:40.918
I think it's just time for us
to go back to normal.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.588
-But I wanna be with you.
-I know.

07:44.338 --> 07:45.506
I know, baby.

07:47.758 --> 07:50.303
You know, what happened
to your dad was an accident.

07:50.386 --> 07:52.346
-As far as we know.
-Charlie, please.

07:54.223 --> 07:57.768
What happened to your dad
was a freak accident.

07:58.102 --> 08:00.646
And nothing like that
is gonna happen to me, okay?

08:00.938 --> 08:02.023
I promise you.

08:02.273 --> 08:03.566
No, it's not that.

I never meant to hurt anyone.
I swear to God.

22:49.409 --> 22:50.369
I just...

22:55.290 --> 22:56.249
[sighs]

22:56.416 --> 22:57.376
It's true.

22:58.251 --> 23:00.087
Steve... is alive.

23:00.170 --> 23:02.005
-Yeah, not dead. Alive.
-Yeah.

23:03.465 --> 23:06.343
He didn't die two months ago.
But I did lose him,

23:06.593 --> 23:07.719
because he broke up with me.

23:07.803 --> 23:10.514
-Oh, my God. That is not the same!
-I know.

23:11.056 --> 23:11.890
I know.

23:16.520 --> 23:20.023
It's just,
he broke up with me because I...

23:22.818 --> 23:25.862
He broke up with me
because we really wanted to have kids.

23:27.155 --> 23:29.991
And we tried,
and we tried for years, and...

23:31.660 --> 23:32.702
I couldn't.

23:35.205 --> 23:37.165
I just kept having miscarriages.

23:39.042 --> 23:40.377
[nurse] I'm so sorry.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.754
[sniffles] Thank you.

23:44.840 --> 23:45.674
[sobs]

23:46.258 --> 23:47.717
Let's get you to your room.

23:59.813 --> 24:01.398
That was my fifth one.

24:03.692 --> 24:07.404
I really thought that I was
gonna have a baby and a family.

24:09.656 --> 24:13.368
And then to find out that there's just
something that's broken inside of me...

24:15.745 --> 24:17.789
I think just going through all that,

24:18.623 --> 24:20.125
it messed me up a little bit.

24:22.919 --> 24:25.046
I swear, I'm not a bad person.

24:26.256 --> 24:27.674
I'm really not. I... [sighs]

24:29.301 --> 24:30.302
It doesn't matter.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.096
I should have never come here.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.851
Jen, I'm so sorry that I hurt you.

24:37.934 --> 24:39.728
It's the last thing that I wanted to do.

24:40.145 --> 24:41.980
I really cherish our friendship.

24:44.774 --> 24:45.859
No, I really do.

24:46.693 --> 24:47.652
[Jen murmurs]

24:48.028 --> 24:50.947
Shit! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

24:51.323 --> 24:52.824
Jesus Christ.

24:54.242 --> 24:55.827
That is a sad story.

24:55.911 --> 24:56.870
Yeah, if you believe it.

24:57.996 --> 24:59.122
What's wrong with you?

24:59.206 --> 25:00.248
Me?

25:00.749 --> 25:02.125
-What about <i>her?</i>
-[woman] Yeah.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.710
Find a different group, Judy.

25:03.793 --> 25:05.003
Fuck, yeah, Linda. Thank you.

25:05.086 --> 25:08.089
Jen, Judy's in pain,
and I know that you are, too,

25:08.423 --> 25:10.926
but that doesn't make it okay for you
to attack someone like that.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.094
[Kyle] Don't y'all hang out all the time?

25:13.428 --> 25:15.096
How did you not know any of that?

25:16.806 --> 25:17.849
I don't know.

25:18.892 --> 25:22.562
Well, either way, Judy has every right
to sit in this circle.

25:22.646 --> 25:26.441
Yeah. I mean, in a way,
her life is sadder than all of ours.

25:26.525 --> 25:29.277
Oh, God. She lied, man.

25:29.486 --> 25:32.364
[Wayne] Jen, everyone's grief
manifests in different ways.

25:32.447 --> 25:35.825
Judy lied.
You flew into this terrifying rage.

25:36.826 --> 25:38.453
We are all doing our best,

25:38.537 --> 25:41.831
but you've got to start
reconciling that anger inside of you.

25:42.958 --> 25:45.126
Don't let it cause you more grief
than you already have.

Hi.

27:22.307 --> 27:24.768
-You could have just told me.
-I know.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.479
I just thought... But I didn't, so...

27:27.562 --> 27:29.648
I should have, but I didn't.
I don't know why.

27:30.190 --> 27:32.275
Because you have issues.

27:42.786 --> 27:43.953
okay, it's weird...

27:44.245 --> 27:45.580
that you lied about Steve.

27:45.664 --> 27:48.083
I mean, it's-- it's fucked up,
you know, but...

27:49.250 --> 27:51.961
maybe it's easier to lie about that
than it is to...

27:52.045 --> 27:54.255
to just tell the truth
about the other stuff.

27:55.799 --> 27:56.633
Maybe.

I'm really sorry that I said
you didn't belong.

And you've... you've lost a lot, too.

28:05.433 --> 28:08.520
But they were just miscarriages.
It wasn't like I have actually--

28:08.603 --> 28:11.731
Well, I think it is an actual... thing.

28:11.815 --> 28:14.901
I mean, not if a Republican is asking.
But...

28:15.610 --> 28:17.153

Yeah.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.328
Oh, okay.

29:08.705 --> 29:10.707
I didn't think
you were ever gonna talk to me again.

29:11.291 --> 29:13.960
-You were so angry.
-I told you you wouldn't like it.

29:14.043 --> 29:15.295
I did not.
