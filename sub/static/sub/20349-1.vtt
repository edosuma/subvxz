00:04.932 --> 00:07.948
<i>( Music playing )</i>

00:08.109 --> 00:10.573
Well, this last year
has been fun.

00:10.729 --> 00:12.559
You know, really fun.

00:12.653 --> 00:14.258
I mean, I'm not gonna lie.

00:14.350 --> 00:17.071
You know, to have gotten
so close to the presidency

00:17.268 --> 00:19.696
and then have
the American people

00:19.782 --> 00:23.563
and Congress
reject me was, um...

00:24.840 --> 00:26.571
Was devastating.

00:27.903 --> 00:29.693
But, um...

00:29.801 --> 00:34.313
I did reacquaint myself
with an old friend of mine

00:34.475 --> 00:37.263
by the name of Selina Meyer.

00:37.685 --> 00:39.318
And I like her.

00:39.749 --> 00:41.047
That's fantastic.

00:41.207 --> 00:42.633
If you're just joining us,

00:42.725 --> 00:46.207
former president
and my old boss Selina Meyer

00:46.279 --> 00:48.547
is with us live for her
first public appearance

00:48.614 --> 00:50.244
<i>since the historic vote</i>

00:50.322 --> 00:52.304
<i>in the House of Representatives
one year ago today.</i>

00:52.328 --> 00:54.227
Madam President, why now?

00:54.347 --> 00:58.017
Well, Dan, I realized that
I have more of myself to give.

00:58.261 --> 00:59.516
This is a big day, people.

00:59.546 --> 01:01.016
Campaign starts right now,

01:01.063 --> 01:03.204
because we are going
to make Buddy Calhoun

01:03.274 --> 01:05.657
the next governor of this
dried coyote turd of a state.

01:05.758 --> 01:08.469
My campaign manager
and fiancée, Amy Brookheimer.

01:08.618 --> 01:10.069
Just say
"campaign manager."

01:10.157 --> 01:11.313
I love that enthusiasm.

01:11.387 --> 01:13.469
Reminder... Nevada
is the Sagebrush State...

01:13.537 --> 01:16.217
Yeah, so saddle up those emphysema
tanks, you inbred cousin-fuckers,

01:16.276 --> 01:18.696
'cause we are going to drag this
state into the 20th century.

01:18.753 --> 01:21.250
- That's right, I said 20th.
( Buddy chuckles )

01:21.366 --> 01:23.076
Tracy, how are we doing
on yard signs?

01:23.132 --> 01:25.092
Writing a memoir, I feel,

01:25.158 --> 01:27.658
is a debt that a president
owes to history.

01:27.719 --> 01:29.049
- Amen.
- Shh.

01:29.095 --> 01:30.891
Selina:
<i>And I'm doing my best</i>

01:30.989 --> 01:33.625
to help the scholars
of the future

01:33.695 --> 01:35.995
reckon with the Meyer years...

01:36.078 --> 01:37.198
Year.

01:37.261 --> 01:39.261
Um, um,

01:39.336 --> 01:41.176
in America's

01:41.244 --> 01:44.032
great tapestry of history.

01:44.068 --> 01:45.448
Now, your predecessor,

01:45.524 --> 01:47.394
- President Stuart Hughes...
- Mm-hmm.

01:47.522 --> 01:49.182
His memoir
has reportedly fetched

01:49.239 --> 01:52.359
an advance of $20 million,
while yours...

01:52.440 --> 01:54.190
Selina: <i>Yeah, I'm really
much more focused</i>

01:54.249 --> 01:56.289
on... the tapestry itself...

01:56.358 --> 01:59.415
The weave, the thread count,

01:59.482 --> 02:01.153
the old lady at the loom...

02:01.235 --> 02:02.606
We're looking
for a few small tweaks

02:02.630 --> 02:05.090
in federal tax law concerning
independent contractors,

02:05.235 --> 02:07.735
which brings us to our
very own mover and shaker,

02:07.818 --> 02:09.277
Beltway Ben.

02:09.358 --> 02:10.358
Thanks, Aiden.

02:10.408 --> 02:11.709
What we need to do...

02:13.574 --> 02:16.574
Uh, I don't have
a slide show thingy.

02:16.633 --> 02:18.963
- Sorry.
- It's called a deck.

02:19.098 --> 02:20.381
Great.

02:20.675 --> 02:22.147
So, what we need to do

02:22.268 --> 02:25.188
is to get this on to the desk
of Congressman Jarvis.

02:25.303 --> 02:27.420
Without him, we don't have
a Chinaman's chance.

02:27.554 --> 02:28.964
- I'm sorry, Ben.
- Yes?

02:29.037 --> 02:30.997
Here at Uber
and in the rest of the world

02:31.093 --> 02:32.912
the word "Chinaman"
is considered

02:33.070 --> 02:34.070
inappropriate.

02:34.175 --> 02:35.787
No, no, no.
It's okay.

02:35.895 --> 02:37.623
My wife is Oriental.

02:37.897 --> 02:39.334
All of them have been.

02:39.397 --> 02:41.369
I kind of got
yellow "fev-ah."

02:41.529 --> 02:42.780
( chuckles )

02:43.776 --> 02:45.381
Now, you've recently drawn
some criticism...

02:45.405 --> 02:46.412
Mm-hmm.

02:46.437 --> 02:48.280
Over
an 11th-hour pardon

02:48.369 --> 02:51.990
of billionaire, private
prison magnate Sherman Tanz,

02:52.045 --> 02:54.375
who's under indictment of
tax evasion and bribery charges.

02:54.422 --> 02:58.512
I have pardoned hundreds
of nonviolent drug offenders,

02:58.628 --> 03:01.508
many of them adults,
who never learned to read,

03:01.602 --> 03:02.562
which is a tragedy.

03:02.587 --> 03:03.602
But Sherman Tanz...

03:03.627 --> 03:05.850
And that is why
I'm taking this opportunity

03:05.936 --> 03:08.842
to announce
my charitable organization,

03:08.939 --> 03:11.897
the Meyer Fund
for Adult Literacy.

03:12.089 --> 03:14.629
Certainly a worthwhile cause, but if we
could bring it back to Sherman Tanz...

03:14.653 --> 03:16.014
And AIDS.

03:16.959 --> 03:18.162
Wow.

03:18.568 --> 03:19.983
- AIDS?
- Yes, AIDS.

03:20.075 --> 03:23.201
AIDS is a big part
of the tapestry.

03:24.121 --> 03:25.661
Explain.
Connect the dots for me.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.326
Jonah:
<i>My fellow representatives,</i>

03:27.374 --> 03:30.834
my conscience demands
that I speak out against HR723,

03:30.878 --> 03:33.298
the so-called
"Healthy School Lunch Act."

03:33.339 --> 03:35.089
Dessert is an apple.

03:35.132 --> 03:37.672
I mean, it's no wonder
kids are shooting up schools

03:37.718 --> 03:39.048
with lunches like these.

03:39.094 --> 03:41.804
When I was a kid,
I ate sloppy joes,

03:41.847 --> 03:43.467
pizza on a bagel.

03:43.515 --> 03:46.765
The only green bean I ate
was a green jelly bean

03:46.810 --> 03:48.560
and I grew up to be so tall,

03:48.604 --> 03:50.993
my stupid mom had to get
a different car.

03:51.179 --> 03:53.485
I will fight against green beans

03:53.594 --> 03:56.391
the same way that I fought
against my deadly disease

03:56.570 --> 03:58.030
called cancer.

04:00.100 --> 04:01.430
For the children.

04:01.657 --> 04:04.438
Yeah, well, I think
sometimes people forget

04:04.536 --> 04:06.743
that I was the first
female president.

04:06.911 --> 04:09.008
- Before Montez.
- Oh, that's right.

04:09.063 --> 04:12.058
Ah, well, speaking
of President Laura Montez,

04:12.192 --> 04:16.202
she won the Nobel Peace Prize for
her work in Tibet. Unprecedented.

04:16.425 --> 04:18.065
- What did you think of her speech?
- Ugh.

04:18.257 --> 04:21.384
I didn't really get a chance
to see it because I was...

04:21.571 --> 04:23.894
( coughing )
I was out of the country.

04:24.337 --> 04:25.743
This is really great.

04:26.173 --> 04:28.386
- No!
- Uh-oh.

04:28.681 --> 04:30.712
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

04:31.480 --> 04:33.980
- <i>( singing on TV )</i>
- ( sighs )

04:34.024 --> 04:35.797
- Before I let you go...
- Uh-huh.

04:35.906 --> 04:37.727
I've got to ask
what we're all thinking...

04:37.861 --> 04:39.571
- The White House.
- Mm.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.299
So, you're definitely not gonna
run again in three years?

04:41.323 --> 04:43.823
I have no plans to run

04:43.993 --> 04:44.993
at this time.

04:45.092 --> 04:48.262
I'm also very busy
with adult literacy.

04:48.539 --> 04:50.039
- And AIDS?
- And AIDS, yes.

04:50.082 --> 04:52.375
- We must never forget AIDS.
- Certainly not.

04:52.420 --> 04:54.469
A very special thank you
to our very special guest,

04:54.547 --> 04:56.078
President Selina Meyer.

04:56.177 --> 04:57.789
- He's a great guy.
- Oh.

04:57.962 --> 04:59.332
Back to you, Jane.

04:59.513 --> 05:00.803
Thanks, Danny.

05:01.066 --> 05:02.484
Danny Egan has been filling in

05:02.521 --> 05:03.859
as my cohost this week,

05:03.895 --> 05:07.484
and we think that
he is doing a terrific job.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.820
We'll be right back
with more "CBS This Morning."

05:11.358 --> 05:13.858
- Man: <i> And we're clear.</i>
- Selina: Okay, well, we got that done.

05:13.934 --> 05:16.531
- Madam President, it's so good to see you.
- Jane!

05:16.660 --> 05:19.240
- Oh, for goodness sakes.
- You let your hair grow.

05:19.358 --> 05:21.398
- Yeah. - We should have
lunch now that you're back.

05:21.488 --> 05:24.068
- Good, good. Wonderful, wonderful.
- Thanks.<i> Ciao.</i>

05:24.226 --> 05:25.953
- What is she like?
- Oh, I love her.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.203
'Cause I've heard she's
a complete gash and a half.

05:28.245 --> 05:29.459
- Yeah, she really is. Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:29.483 --> 05:31.903
Hey, thank you so much
for doing this.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.322
I am so glad to hear
that you're feeling better.

05:33.346 --> 05:35.266
Oh, come on, come on.
Everything's... yes.

05:35.407 --> 05:36.743
- Gary.
- Dan.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.439
So, how did I do?
Somebody tell...

05:38.486 --> 05:41.470
- ..how I did. Literally, anyone.
- Oh, my God, you were fantastic.

05:41.495 --> 05:44.165
- You were great, ma'am.
- Thank you, Richard.

05:44.261 --> 05:45.322
- Oh, absolutely.
- Thank you.

05:45.346 --> 05:48.720
I need my coat
and I need my purse.

05:48.859 --> 05:50.267
Can you believe this?

05:50.353 --> 05:53.525
On the anni-fucking-versary
of the historic House vote.

05:53.687 --> 05:57.220
I feel like we're celebrating
my frat house gang rape.

05:57.278 --> 05:59.275
Except I didn't even get a
candlelight vigil.

05:59.353 --> 06:00.610
I love candles.

06:00.689 --> 06:02.821
Hey, Richard, what else do
we have lined up for me?

06:02.863 --> 06:04.325
You've got interviews
the rest of the day, ma'am.

06:04.349 --> 06:05.675
Yeah, but you got to call
Wilner at the "Times."

06:05.699 --> 06:07.159
"Indianapolis Times," got it.

06:07.208 --> 06:09.538
And "Time Magazine,"
let's get in touch with them

06:09.578 --> 06:11.760
because the world
really needs to know...

06:11.785 --> 06:13.197
- About the gang bang thing?
- Oh.

06:13.260 --> 06:14.712
Well, I know you.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.500
- Oh. Hey.
- Hey, hey.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.254
- So?
- Sublime.

06:19.296 --> 06:21.086
- Yeah?
- Lee, just sublime.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.301
So, you don't think
I came off too...

06:23.342 --> 06:24.595
Insane?
Not at all.

06:24.620 --> 06:25.650
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:25.697 --> 06:27.314
Oh, good.
What about when he threw

06:27.369 --> 06:29.159
the Hughes question at me
about the advance?

06:29.235 --> 06:31.034
- I mean...
- I didn't actually watch the interview,

06:31.058 --> 06:33.689
but everybody's talking about
how gorgeous you looked.

06:33.769 --> 06:35.349
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.248
You wanna try that new place
I was telling you about?

06:37.272 --> 06:39.417
I gotta bolt, but I will catch
up with you all later, though.

06:39.441 --> 06:41.711
So... wait a minute. You're not
coming back to the office?

06:41.735 --> 06:43.395
No, I got an unofficial lunch

06:43.479 --> 06:47.181
with a potential big foreign
donor for the Meyer Fund.

06:47.236 --> 06:49.064
That could get us into
trouble down the line.

06:49.115 --> 06:51.658
<i>Señor</i> Ocampo is having trouble
nudging his visas through,

06:51.705 --> 06:53.439
so I called our friends
over at the State Department.

06:53.463 --> 06:54.806
That definitely will.

06:54.855 --> 06:58.369
I look forward seeing you in
your entirety a little later.

06:58.460 --> 07:01.877
- Oh, my God.
- Nice. Okay. Bye.

07:01.964 --> 07:04.464
- <i>Adios.</i>
- Okay. Not a word.

07:04.508 --> 07:06.718
Seriously, not a word,
all right?

07:06.760 --> 07:08.571
Ma'am, they're saying it's
gonna take an hour longer

07:08.595 --> 07:10.050
to get to the offices
because of traffic.

07:10.074 --> 07:11.113
What's going on?

07:11.138 --> 07:13.426
- President Montez is
in town addressing the UN.

07:13.454 --> 07:14.654
It's gonna be pretty exciting.

07:15.592 --> 07:17.502
A minute of your time,
Congressman Powder?

07:17.575 --> 07:19.449
- Absolutely, Roger.
- What?

07:19.635 --> 07:22.590
Congressman Minority
House Leader Furlong.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.574
Do you know what
the chief agricultural product

07:24.637 --> 07:26.396
of my district in Ohio is?

07:26.446 --> 07:29.196
I'll give you a hint...
Looks like Will's wife's clit.

07:29.676 --> 07:31.972
- Mangos?
- No. Tell him, Will.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.869
- Green beans. - That's why I
spent two months jamming them

07:34.913 --> 07:37.043
into that school lunch bill
like what, Will?

07:37.082 --> 07:40.132
Like me jamming anonymous
trucker cock in my mouth

07:40.169 --> 07:42.249
at a public restroom
well known for that purpose.

07:42.296 --> 07:43.706
I don't know if you can hear me

07:43.755 --> 07:46.545
over the sound of your
ball tumors metastasizing,

07:46.592 --> 07:49.092
but Americans don't care
what poor kids eat.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.426
Actually, Congressman,
better tasting school lunches

07:51.471 --> 07:52.931
poll surprisingly well.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.137
It's a real hot button issue.

07:54.199 --> 07:56.699
Kent Davison.
How the mighty have fallen.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.057
You want me to call
a Japanese porn shoot,

07:59.104 --> 08:01.984
see if I can get you a real job
sponging up bukkake parties?

08:02.024 --> 08:04.864
Although you might have to lie
about working for Meyer.

08:04.902 --> 08:06.612
He's already got a job

08:06.653 --> 08:08.743
much better than sponging
up jizz, right, Kent?

08:08.780 --> 08:10.530
( exhales )

08:10.574 --> 08:12.204
Let's go, Will.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.637
Feel better.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.375
- <i>( Music blaring on radio )</i>
- Selina: Son of a Sam.

08:22.419 --> 08:24.089
Offices in the South Bronx?

08:24.129 --> 08:25.945
Take this.
I can't stand this anymore.

08:26.023 --> 08:27.624
- We should be in the Meatpacking District.
- I know.

08:27.648 --> 08:29.007
- It's so chic.
- Exactly.

08:29.032 --> 08:31.742
I mean, I'm not the President of the
Dominican Republic, you know.

08:31.788 --> 08:32.985
They should be so lucky.

08:33.010 --> 08:34.340
Congressman Diaz
said that optics

08:34.392 --> 08:36.102
of you in the Bronx
are really good.

08:36.164 --> 08:38.578
Okay, well, then maybe I can host
"Showtime at the Apollo" next week.

08:38.602 --> 08:39.907
- I'll check on that.
- No, don't.

08:39.931 --> 08:42.547
- We love you, Selina!
- Oh, I love... ugh.

08:42.606 --> 08:44.056
Ugh.

08:44.107 --> 08:47.227
I mean, whose balls
did I twerk to end up here,

08:47.277 --> 08:48.937
in the Triangle
Shirtwaist offices?

08:48.987 --> 08:51.027
I mean, seriously,
this is the worst place

08:51.073 --> 08:52.711
they've ever stuffed
an ex-president,

08:52.748 --> 08:54.485
and I'm including JFK's coffin.

08:54.576 --> 08:55.720
Ooh, I'm gonna get you
the same one.

08:55.744 --> 08:56.834
- Oh, yeah. Good.
- Yeah.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.477
Um, are there
any messages for me?

08:58.524 --> 08:59.594
- No, ma'am.
- <i>Okay.</i>

08:59.646 --> 09:02.946
- You were wonderful today.
- Oh, thank you.

09:03.382 --> 09:04.962
- Who is that woman?
- I can find out.

09:05.087 --> 09:06.180
Oh, it doesn't matter.

09:06.207 --> 09:08.342
The National Association
for Transgender People

09:08.367 --> 09:09.510
would like to give you an award.

09:09.534 --> 09:11.735
Oh, well, that's nice.
Tell them I accept.

09:11.802 --> 09:12.938
- Them?
- It's "her."

09:13.016 --> 09:14.110
- Her.
- Him.

09:14.155 --> 09:16.155
I don't know. Tell the
bearded ladies I'm a-coming.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.826
And your editor called
about the pages to your book.

09:17.850 --> 09:19.133
You're six months behind.

09:19.184 --> 09:20.828
You know what being
an ex-president is like?

09:20.852 --> 09:22.522
It's like being a man's nipple.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.442
People go right by it
to jerk off a dick.

09:25.482 --> 09:26.602
- Ah.
- Really.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.297
All right, so, listen, Richard,

09:28.359 --> 09:33.109
from now on, I am going to be
only about speaking engagements.

09:33.282 --> 09:35.912
Okay? Cha-king,
cha-king, cha-king!

09:35.951 --> 09:37.262
- Right?
- It's cha-ching, cha-ching.

09:37.286 --> 09:38.656
- No, it's cha-king.
- Okay.

09:38.704 --> 09:41.124
Start out by calling
Mutual of Omaha.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.004
And I'm only
flying there private.

09:43.090 --> 09:45.340
- And I'm certainly not gonna...
- Is now a good time, Mom?

09:45.364 --> 09:47.042
Marjorie, come on in.

09:47.087 --> 09:50.457
You know, Marjorie, since you're
now heading the Meyer Fund,

09:50.507 --> 09:53.436
it would be a good idea for you not
to call me "Mom" here in the office.

09:53.467 --> 09:54.683
Of course, ma'am.
Yes.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.300
So, did you see
today's interview?

09:57.347 --> 09:59.007
I didn't know you were
gonna give me AIDS.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.637
( laughing )

10:00.684 --> 10:03.394
Marjorie.

10:03.437 --> 10:04.767
That's funny.

10:04.813 --> 10:06.903
You did...
Are you making a joke?

10:06.940 --> 10:10.230
No, sir, ma'am.
We can't do anything about AIDS.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.477
Who are you, Ronald Reagan?

10:11.528 --> 10:13.318
- Hi, everyone.
- Hi, darling.

10:13.363 --> 10:14.487
Your daughter
is here to see you.

10:14.511 --> 10:16.358
How are you, sweetie?

10:16.408 --> 10:18.158
What brings you
to this neighborhood, honey?

10:18.201 --> 10:20.201
Buying chicken blood
for a voodoo rite?

10:20.245 --> 10:22.075
Well, I came to take
Marjorie to lunch.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.582
Okay.

10:23.623 --> 10:24.753
I have AIDS now.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.081
( laughs )
That's hilarious.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.326
I don't get it.

10:28.373 --> 10:29.735
Maybe it's her delivery.
I don't know.

10:29.759 --> 10:31.680
- What delivery?
- Mom, I saw your big interview.

10:31.787 --> 10:33.915
Yeah, I know.
Wasn't I just so great?

10:33.967 --> 10:36.127
It was just really nice
to see you out there again...

10:36.178 --> 10:37.200
- .. you know, not just...
- Sure.

10:37.224 --> 10:38.246
.. sitting in the house

10:38.271 --> 10:41.115
- in your bathrobe with Gary.
- Yeah. We played backgammon.

10:41.144 --> 10:43.974
- Or at the institution...
- At the spa. I was at the spa.

10:44.084 --> 10:45.454
- Spa.
- The spa. Right.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.115
Mom, can I talk to you
for a minute?

10:47.178 --> 10:48.690
- She doesn't like "Mom."
- What?

10:48.732 --> 10:50.974
- Sure, darling.
- Well, I...

10:51.041 --> 10:53.412
I just wanted to give you
your check for this month.

10:53.437 --> 10:54.451
Thank you.

10:54.506 --> 10:56.474
Ma'am, the Apollo
was a soft pass.

10:56.499 --> 10:58.499
Okay, can I have a moment
with my daughter?

10:58.545 --> 11:00.118
- Yep.
- Catherine, honey,

11:00.160 --> 11:02.870
a lot of the staff
has been complaining

11:02.913 --> 11:04.904
'cause they feel kind of cramped

11:05.040 --> 11:07.154
and they're not in Midtown.

11:07.271 --> 11:10.842
But I think that will require
a little bit more cash.

11:10.912 --> 11:13.427
Okay, you know what? If you want
to talk about the money thing...

11:13.451 --> 11:14.882
- Yes. - ...you can
talk about it...

11:14.925 --> 11:17.006
- Both: With Marjorie.
- Great. Thank you.

11:19.000 --> 11:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:27.698 --> 11:30.408
Marjorie, when Mother died

11:30.482 --> 11:33.209
and she gave Catherine
all of her money...

11:33.348 --> 11:35.209
You've been over your budget
the last few months.

11:35.233 --> 11:37.983
- Okay.
- You know, there's an old Chippewa saying,

11:38.060 --> 11:40.470
- "The 'coyotay' always howls..."
- You know what?

11:40.582 --> 11:44.162
I'm not that interested in
what the "coyotay" has to say

11:44.204 --> 11:45.664
unless he's writing me a check.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.467
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yeah.

11:47.975 --> 11:49.935
- Thank you.
- Richard: <i> Ma'am, me again.</i>

11:50.076 --> 11:51.771
The secretary's name
is Jennicker.

11:51.896 --> 11:54.338
- That can't be right.
- 79 grand.

11:54.490 --> 11:57.217
- ( scoffs ) - Better sign
me up for some food stamps.

11:57.297 --> 11:58.757
Maybe look into an application.

11:58.845 --> 12:00.505
This fucking country.

12:00.595 --> 12:02.465
There he is.
My golden boy.

12:02.514 --> 12:05.138
- Danny, you're killing it.
- Dan. It's... yeah.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.046
Look, between you and me,
the network's gonna name you

12:07.070 --> 12:08.630
Jane's permanent cohost
on Friday, so...

12:08.687 --> 12:11.187
- Get the f...
- Jane: <i> Fuck my face!</i>

12:12.992 --> 12:14.792
Do you know what's wrong
with that salad?

12:14.860 --> 12:17.748
- Uh, no.
- Figure it out.

12:17.821 --> 12:19.326
Yeah, I guess
I should've told you.

12:19.393 --> 12:21.263
She got rid of
her last three cohosts.

12:21.366 --> 12:24.026
- Wait, what? - Yeah, probably
wrecked their careers, too.

12:24.163 --> 12:26.073
( chatter )

12:27.886 --> 12:30.346
- Stevie! Stevie, Stevie.
- What's up?

12:30.404 --> 12:32.773
I have an idea that I think is
really gonna impress the network.

12:32.797 --> 12:35.507
Have you ever heard of Congressman
Jonah Ryan from New Hampshire?

12:35.550 --> 12:37.193
Great interview.
Charming guy.

12:37.248 --> 12:38.536
I can get him
on the phone right now.

12:38.560 --> 12:41.131
Hey, ma'am, I got big news
from the White House.

12:41.219 --> 12:43.469
- Oh, really? What?
- They want you to pick an artist

12:43.513 --> 12:45.521
for your official
presidential portrait.

12:45.595 --> 12:47.599
Well, I'd rather
still be president.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.678
- Yeah, that's true.
- You know what?

12:49.853 --> 12:52.523
Get me whoever painted
Ambassador Stone's wife

12:52.564 --> 12:54.654
and made her look
like not a twat.

12:54.768 --> 12:56.857
- Uh-huh.
- I mean, that was real artistry.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.263
- Hey, where's... hey, Richard?
- Yes, ma'am?

12:59.654 --> 13:01.888
- <i>What's going on with the speeches?</i>
- Let's see.

13:02.021 --> 13:04.732
We have the National
Auto Dealers for 100,000.

13:04.834 --> 13:06.334
You've gotta be kidding me.

13:06.416 --> 13:08.366
That's half of what Hughes gets.

13:08.497 --> 13:10.107
That is pure sexism.

13:10.180 --> 13:12.470
You call those people back
and you tell them

13:12.555 --> 13:15.885
that I was the first female
President of the United States

13:16.011 --> 13:19.763
and I will not work for less
than 87 cents on the dollar.

13:19.883 --> 13:22.069
- Yes, ma'am. - And tell them
I'll stand at a glass podium

13:22.093 --> 13:23.842
and wear a short skirt.

13:23.996 --> 13:26.287
- What about Omaha?
- They won't give us a private jet.

13:26.420 --> 13:27.950
And you said not to touch
anything without a private jet.

13:27.974 --> 13:30.098
- I know.
- <i>Plus, they won't cover Andrew's fee.</i>

13:30.143 --> 13:31.983
- What? What's Andrew's fee?
- <i>( door opens )</i>

13:32.020 --> 13:34.029
- It's my fee.
- Gary: <i> Oh, God.</i>

13:34.196 --> 13:36.406
Omaha is small potatoes,
zero gravy.

13:36.566 --> 13:38.526
I know some guys in Abu Dhabi

13:38.568 --> 13:41.188
who are looking for
a license to import sand.

13:41.238 --> 13:42.568
No, I want Omaha.

13:42.687 --> 13:46.067
Well, Lee, their offer
was a slap in the face.

13:46.201 --> 13:47.693
Hey, Andrew, I don't care

13:47.762 --> 13:50.682
if it's a punch
in my big, hairy dick.

13:50.887 --> 13:52.427
- Okay? Go!
- Yep.

13:52.457 --> 13:53.997
Tell them I'll jump
out of a cake

13:54.042 --> 13:57.292
- with tassels on my sagging tits!
- Mm.

13:57.443 --> 13:59.457
( sighs )
What? What is your fee?

13:59.513 --> 14:02.342
- It's akin to a finder's fee.
- What do you find?

14:02.509 --> 14:04.629
Besides the most beautiful
woman in the world?

14:04.709 --> 14:06.968
- Oh, God. ( laughs )
- ( sighs ) Oh, God.

14:08.223 --> 14:09.853
- ( groaning )
- So sappy.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.431
Buddy:
<i>Hey, babe?</i>

14:11.476 --> 14:13.079
We found a video of a woman
who says she did cocaine

14:13.103 --> 14:15.103
with Governor Steptoe's wife
in college.

14:15.146 --> 14:17.896
- Wow.
- Hey, Purple Mountain's Majesty,

14:17.941 --> 14:19.300
we need to put together
an attack ad

14:19.324 --> 14:21.318
yester-the-fuck-day,
so give me five options

14:21.388 --> 14:23.662
from "party girl" to "coke
whore for cock," you know?

14:23.712 --> 14:25.172
Oh, you know what?

14:25.244 --> 14:27.414
I actually went to high school
with Kristin Steptoe

14:27.534 --> 14:29.334
and she's a lovely gal, so...

14:29.369 --> 14:31.739
My guess is if you gave her
a rail to snort off your dick,

14:31.788 --> 14:33.658
she would let you fuck
the hole in her septum.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.787
Oh, boy.
Look, um,

14:35.834 --> 14:38.294
I think I'm gonna have
to put my foot down on this

14:38.336 --> 14:40.376
and just say
we're not gonna use that.

14:40.422 --> 14:42.592
Okay?
Is that all right?

14:42.632 --> 14:44.172
You're making
an executive decision?

14:44.217 --> 14:45.757
Right? I mean,
don't you think?

14:45.802 --> 14:47.012
- No, I like that.
- Yeah, so.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.303
- You're the boss.
- Okay. Yes.

14:48.346 --> 14:49.506
And my foot is down on that.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.435
- Great.
- Okay, great.

14:52.191 --> 14:53.611
Just do "cock whore."

14:53.799 --> 14:56.509
Gary:
<i>Madame is up 950 points.</i>

14:56.646 --> 14:58.056
- Nice!
- No, no, no! Uh-uh.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.306
You don't wanna do that.

14:59.357 --> 15:00.567
See?
You put these here...

15:00.652 --> 15:01.895
- Uh-huh.
- And here.

15:01.920 --> 15:03.365
You see how
that's better for you?

15:03.421 --> 15:04.943
- So much better. Yeah.
- Do you actually understand that?

15:04.967 --> 15:06.334
Very much so. Thank you.

15:06.479 --> 15:08.559
- 'Cause honestly...
- <i>( door buzzes )</i>

15:08.825 --> 15:11.115
- Who could that be at this hour?
- It's only 7:00.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.951
- Richard.
- Oh. Hi, Gary.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.696
This is...
Now is not a good time.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.038
Is that Richard?

15:16.082 --> 15:18.042
- Excuse me.
- <i>Richard, come in.</i>

15:18.084 --> 15:19.884
Hey, what's going on
with Omaha, by the way?

15:19.919 --> 15:22.299
Oh, yes. Walter Pallenberg's
jet is unavailable

15:22.339 --> 15:24.709
because he's taking it on
a fuck tour of South America.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.553
- Of course. - It's weird that
his assistant told me that.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.537
- I'm sitting there.
- Want something to eat?

15:28.720 --> 15:30.510
Are you hungry?
We've got a lot of food here.

15:30.555 --> 15:32.116
- <i>( door opens, closes )</i>
- Catherine, I'm home!

15:32.140 --> 15:34.520
Oh! Marjorie, hi.
We're in here.

15:34.584 --> 15:36.029
Come join the party.

15:36.144 --> 15:37.663
It's like Grand
Central Station here, right?

15:37.687 --> 15:38.807
- I know.
- Good evening.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.805
You know what?
Just move whatever.

15:40.857 --> 15:43.107
You know,
we're actually... no, no!

15:43.151 --> 15:44.826
- Now she's mad.
- Hey, Marjorie,

15:44.852 --> 15:46.779
I wanna add
something to the fund

15:46.863 --> 15:49.037
<i>sort of to balance out the AIDS.</i>

15:49.115 --> 15:50.615
Something fun.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.303
Ooh, how about Vets for Pets?

15:52.410 --> 15:54.160
I don't know what it is,
but it sounds good.

15:54.240 --> 15:56.504
Yeah, or, I don't know,
stuttering.

15:57.045 --> 15:59.709
Those people
really make me laugh.

15:59.751 --> 16:03.461
- Oh, excuse me, sorry. - I'll go put
together a list of some fun causes, Mom.

16:03.505 --> 16:06.505
Oh, that "Mom" thing,
let's not do that here either.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.089
- Selina.
- Well, uh...

16:08.134 --> 16:09.420
- Ma'am.
- Yeah, that's it.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.352
All right, time to
write this book.

16:11.427 --> 16:13.887
- Where were we?
- First sentence.

16:13.968 --> 16:16.918
- Then let's jump into the Middle East.
- Okay.

16:16.970 --> 16:18.680
Now, I'm trying to remember,

16:18.746 --> 16:21.396
what was the name of that
Iranian trade minister?

16:21.564 --> 16:23.984
Gerard Hojati. Do you know
what I remember from that day?

16:24.056 --> 16:26.226
Oh, look what... look.

16:26.290 --> 16:28.117
- You missed that white one right
down there. - Yep, got it.

16:28.141 --> 16:29.261
Let's call Mike again.

16:29.325 --> 16:30.825
- ( thuds )
- Ow! God!

16:30.907 --> 16:33.697
Be careful 'cause
that cabinet's valuable.

16:33.743 --> 16:35.833
- ( phone ringing )
- <i>( babies crying )</i>

16:35.870 --> 16:38.790
McLintock residence.
Ellen speaking.

16:38.832 --> 16:41.712
- Is your father available?
- He's not my father.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.359
Yes, I am, sweetie.
I am your father.

16:43.384 --> 16:44.924
Remember, I adopted you?

16:45.088 --> 16:47.726
- Hello?
- Hey, Mike. How... wow.

16:47.781 --> 16:49.531
- How are you?
- <i>A little crazed.</i>

16:49.624 --> 16:51.414
Milo's all about cheese sticks.

16:51.539 --> 16:53.430
I found a little button
in his diaper.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.031
- Do I have to call a doctor?
- I think he's in a kennel or something.

16:56.055 --> 16:57.451
- I can't hear you.
- Oh, cool, are they getting a dog?

16:57.475 --> 16:59.055
Sorry, ma'am.
I'm in the baby bubble.

16:59.102 --> 17:01.852
You gotta hit them in the nose
with a newspaper.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.686
<i>That'll quiet 'em down.</i>

17:03.732 --> 17:06.232
Mike, listen, we're trying to
figure out, if you can hear me,

17:06.276 --> 17:09.736
what happened on the Middle
East trip with Leon West.

17:09.779 --> 17:12.239
Hang on.
Daddy's got his book.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.412
May 3rd. En route to Tehran.
Air Force One.

17:14.451 --> 17:16.406
- May 3rd.
- <i>Two eggs, hard scrambled.</i>

17:16.431 --> 17:18.281
- Red pepper strips?
- <i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

17:18.371 --> 17:19.805
Not what you ate, Mike.

17:19.921 --> 17:22.758
Just tell me...
No, no, I want that.

17:22.821 --> 17:25.289
- Okay. ( babbling ) -<i> Just
wanna know what happened.</i>

17:25.377 --> 17:26.958
- Jesus.
- <i>Uh, oh, yeah, yeah.</i>

17:27.005 --> 17:28.561
We met with
Trade Minister Johati.

17:28.596 --> 17:30.296
Oh, Trade Minister Johati.

17:30.359 --> 17:31.570
- Okay?
- That's what I said.

17:31.622 --> 17:34.031
I'm on the phone, okay?
You're as bad as these dogs.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.937
- Is that her?
- Ma'am...

17:36.014 --> 17:38.014
Tell her now.
Tell her or I'll tell her.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.508
Okay. Hang on.

17:39.632 --> 17:42.241
<i>Wendy and I were talking that if
you're gonna keep using the diary,</i>

17:42.265 --> 17:44.883
maybe you should
start paying me.

17:44.976 --> 17:47.898
What? Okay, fine.
I don't give a shit.

17:48.047 --> 17:51.277
- I thought I'd never work again.
- Me, too!

17:51.390 --> 17:53.121
Former ma'am,
there are news stories

17:53.146 --> 17:55.297
about the Sherman Tanz pardon
in the "Washington Post"

17:55.366 --> 17:56.601
and "Indianapolis Times."

17:56.672 --> 17:59.781
Does anybody have anything else
to focus on in the world?

17:59.871 --> 18:02.371
You know? Where the fuck is
a tsunami when you need it?

18:02.415 --> 18:06.285
But the good news is we've just
received a large donation from...

18:06.336 --> 18:08.286
- Sherman Tanz.
- Oh.

18:08.338 --> 18:09.958
Well, don't put that
in the fund.

18:10.006 --> 18:12.466
Also, guess who I found outside.

18:12.509 --> 18:14.719
- Did that homeless man die?
- Oh, no.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.806
- Mike?
- Madam President.

18:16.885 --> 18:18.063
- It's Mike McLintock.
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>

18:18.087 --> 18:19.471
Look at this place!
You guys...

18:19.539 --> 18:20.749
What happened to your lip?

18:20.821 --> 18:21.924
Oh, Maude bit me.

18:21.963 --> 18:23.783
Ah. You should put her down.

18:24.189 --> 18:25.385
That's my daughter, ma'am.

18:25.502 --> 18:27.582
It's a cute story. We were
playing in the backyard...

18:27.709 --> 18:29.447
"Catch the tiger,"
and I was the prey.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.487
- She got up on top...
- Did you bring the diary?

18:31.533 --> 18:34.885
Yeah. I got it. And I don't
think we ever discussed salary.

18:35.002 --> 18:36.279
We should probably
iron that out, so...

18:36.303 --> 18:38.822
Oh, yeah. You get paid
when the book's finished.

18:38.978 --> 18:41.721
Okay. And what's
the timeline for that?

18:41.792 --> 18:44.202
- I don't know.
- No? Okay.

18:44.347 --> 18:46.387
Oh, and I took the Acela up.

18:46.495 --> 18:49.165
It's pretty steep.
I'd love to get reimbursed.

18:49.245 --> 18:50.844
<i>We'll... also when
the book's finished.</i>

18:50.900 --> 18:52.991
- Oh, right.
- <i>Then you get that...</i>

18:53.132 --> 18:54.302
<i>reimbursement.</i>

18:54.455 --> 18:57.572
Find some space
for yourself out there.

18:57.744 --> 18:59.694
But wait, I need the diary.

19:01.117 --> 19:02.117
- Okay.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

19:02.225 --> 19:03.861
( phone buzzes )

19:04.039 --> 19:05.499
Ma'am, great news.

19:05.603 --> 19:08.588
We got Marty Leonhardt's G5
for Omaha.

19:08.679 --> 19:10.309
Really? Great!

19:10.441 --> 19:11.571
All righty!

19:11.609 --> 19:13.697
Omaha's a go, go, go.

19:13.783 --> 19:15.721
Ma'am, you've been
to Omaha before.

19:15.775 --> 19:17.877
You didn't really care for it.

19:18.064 --> 19:19.408
Um...

19:19.583 --> 19:21.503
- Okay, look.
- Is there something...

19:21.582 --> 19:23.122
I'm gonna tell you
something, okay?

19:23.246 --> 19:25.246
- Okay.
- But it's top secret.

19:25.290 --> 19:27.502
Ooh, I love secrets.

19:29.085 --> 19:31.783
- I'm gonna go to Omaha because...
- Okay.

19:31.958 --> 19:35.572
Omaha is a 20-minute drive
right across the border

19:35.667 --> 19:37.994
to Council Bluffs, Iowa...

19:38.136 --> 19:39.221
Beautiful.

19:39.298 --> 19:41.588
Where they have their annual

19:41.681 --> 19:43.601
Madison Monroe dinner.

19:43.641 --> 19:44.721
Fun!

19:44.767 --> 19:46.728
Which you have to go to

19:46.786 --> 19:49.642
if you're gonna run
for president again.

19:49.799 --> 19:51.471
Huh?

19:51.659 --> 19:54.320
I'm gonna run
for president again.

19:54.987 --> 19:59.410
- That is a great idea.
- I know, I know.

19:59.449 --> 20:02.119
I think you're definitely
ready for this.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.410
Yeah, I feel so great
about this.

20:04.454 --> 20:06.004
- You should.
- Yeah.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.999
Are you sure
you're ready for this?

20:08.041 --> 20:10.121
So, I'm gonna tell the whole
family about it tonight.

20:10.168 --> 20:12.418
You know, I mean, such as it is.
Whatever.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.502
And if any one of them objects,

20:14.547 --> 20:16.534
then, it's okay,
I just won't run.

20:16.574 --> 20:19.034
- Well, you got my vote.
- Why would I need your fucking vote?

20:19.218 --> 20:21.638
You wouldn't.
What a crazy idea.

20:21.679 --> 20:22.784
( knocking )

20:22.923 --> 20:24.760
Hey, are you almost...

20:25.266 --> 20:27.016
Get out! No.
Get out. Guards!

20:27.143 --> 20:29.350
Oh, my God.
Your cancer is bullshit.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.018
No, I did have cancer.

20:31.149 --> 20:32.949
I had to go through
six weeks of chemotherapy.

20:33.078 --> 20:35.538
All my hair fell out,
including my pubes, Dan.

20:35.652 --> 20:36.987
Come on,
you never had any pubes.

20:37.056 --> 20:38.885
But guess what.
People liked it.

20:39.011 --> 20:40.931
Okay?
They felt sorry for me.

20:40.972 --> 20:44.062
I even got four and a half pity
handies out of it, so I kept shaving.

20:44.202 --> 20:46.784
- What's the big fucking deal about it?
- Big fucking deal?

20:46.869 --> 20:48.452
Jesus, you look like
you should be underground

20:48.476 --> 20:51.306
worshipping an atomic bomb,
you human fucking Pap smear.

20:51.362 --> 20:53.322
How dare you speak
to a cancer survivor that way?

20:53.354 --> 20:54.483
Hey, let's go.

20:54.508 --> 20:56.178
- Got two minutes.
- Yeah, yeah.

20:56.273 --> 20:58.113
Do not tell anyone about this.

20:58.189 --> 20:59.414
You know, I didn't think
it was possible

20:59.438 --> 21:01.358
for you to look
more like a giant cock.

21:01.391 --> 21:02.870
I guess it's true what they
say... you are what you eat.

21:02.894 --> 21:04.515
Well, you eat an entire
fucking tanning bed.

21:04.539 --> 21:06.200
I got an idea.
I just wanna draw a urethra...

21:06.224 --> 21:07.684
Get out of here.
Stop! Stop!

21:07.725 --> 21:09.265
- It will be funny.
- Shut up. Stop it.

21:09.310 --> 21:11.310
- Man: <i> Four, three...</i>
- Just let it happen.

21:11.354 --> 21:13.354
- Man ♪2: <i> We're set.</i>
- Stop it! You're a dick, Dan.

21:13.385 --> 21:15.019
Welcome back
to "CBS This Morning."

21:15.066 --> 21:18.284
Joining me now is freshman Congressman
Jonah Ryan of New Hampshire,

21:18.551 --> 21:20.752
who recently had
a close shave with cancer.

21:20.979 --> 21:22.299
- Don't.
- Now, Congressman...

21:22.496 --> 21:24.616
you were really on the razor's
edge there for a while.

21:24.701 --> 21:27.963
- Stop it. - Do you ever get into
a lather about the bald truth...

21:28.081 --> 21:30.421
You know what, Dan?
F you!

21:30.768 --> 21:33.666
You think you're such a big shot
just because you're on TV

21:33.727 --> 21:36.081
and you have a fancy tie
and a tiny little microphone.

21:36.170 --> 21:37.799
Everybody on TV sucks.

21:37.900 --> 21:40.931
It's not nice, Dan,
to make fun of other people

21:40.967 --> 21:42.939
who are supposed
to be your friend.

21:43.077 --> 21:44.907
Just because I look
like a penis.

21:45.096 --> 21:48.006
- ( cord rattles )
- Oh! God, ( bleep ).

21:48.057 --> 21:49.467
( bleep ) chair.

21:51.823 --> 21:53.873
<i>How do I even get out of here?</i>

21:53.980 --> 21:55.236
<i>( door slams )</i>

21:55.440 --> 21:58.345
That was Congressman Jonah Ryan
of New Hampshire.

21:58.609 --> 21:59.970
We'll be right back.

22:00.106 --> 22:02.276
And we're clear.

22:02.363 --> 22:05.323
Shit, Stevie, I had no idea anything
like that was gonna happen.

22:05.366 --> 22:07.905
I totally understand if the network
has lost confidence in me.

22:07.952 --> 22:09.561
Are you kidding me?
This is great TV.

22:09.592 --> 22:11.035
You're the fucking man!

22:11.080 --> 22:12.620
Great job.

22:12.665 --> 22:13.785
Oh, fuck me.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.043
No more goddamn bronzer.

22:16.085 --> 22:20.835
Okay, guys, I called
this family meeting because...

22:20.882 --> 22:23.655
I have something very exciting
that I wanna talk to you about.

22:23.733 --> 22:26.733
But if anybody
has any objections,

22:26.809 --> 22:29.979
I will absolutely not do this.

22:30.099 --> 22:32.889
- Okay?
- We are behind you no matter what, Lee.

22:32.935 --> 22:35.635
I know that this last
year has been...

22:35.688 --> 22:38.018
not very easy for all of us,

22:38.066 --> 22:39.226
myself included.

22:39.275 --> 22:41.475
<i>But I have decided</i>

22:41.527 --> 22:43.777
that I am going to run

22:43.821 --> 22:45.951
for president again.

22:48.493 --> 22:50.203
What?

22:50.244 --> 22:53.164
No! You...
You can't do that.

22:53.206 --> 22:56.616
- ( hyperventilating )
- Well, yeah, I can, honey.

22:56.667 --> 22:58.747
- ( sobbing )
- What?

22:58.795 --> 23:00.154
Well...

23:00.673 --> 23:02.310
Huh?

23:02.965 --> 23:06.084
- I didn't see that coming. Did you?
- Eh...

23:06.240 --> 23:08.473
Andrew, can you
help me out here with this?

23:08.513 --> 23:09.933
Actually...

23:09.972 --> 23:11.812
Nobody thinks
this is a good idea?

23:11.849 --> 23:14.349
Please don't do that.
You can't do this to us.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.693
Catherine, let me just explain
something to you, sweetie.

23:16.729 --> 23:19.939
All right? I really don't
care what you think.

23:19.982 --> 23:22.232
I'm gonna run
for president again.

23:22.276 --> 23:24.538
Okay? Mommy's gonna be
president again.

23:24.649 --> 23:27.523
But you said that
if any one of us objects

23:27.593 --> 23:28.843
that you're not gonna do it.

23:28.913 --> 23:32.309
Yeah, but I didn't expect
anybody to object, did I?

23:32.409 --> 23:35.739
This was a test, folks, and you all failed.
You really did.

23:35.873 --> 23:37.643
- No, I just... - Yeah,
woman, you really did.

23:37.667 --> 23:39.343
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Family meeting is now...

23:39.379 --> 23:40.709
( mocking )
No, I don't wanna...

23:40.795 --> 23:43.163
I don't wanna hear it, okay?

23:43.302 --> 23:45.671
Family meeting is adjourned.
La-la-la-la.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.048
Everybody up.
Get up.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.223
Out, out.

23:48.261 --> 23:49.874
I love you, but get out.

23:51.311 --> 23:53.035
- Is that good? You like that?
- It's good.

23:53.099 --> 23:54.269
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

23:54.308 --> 23:56.308
- What's good about it?
- I...

23:56.366 --> 23:58.102
- What do you like?
- Don't know.

23:58.146 --> 23:59.790
- What do you want me to say?
- I want you to talk dirty.

23:59.814 --> 24:01.734
- You know...
- Oh. Really?

24:01.774 --> 24:03.574
Yeah.
Like how you do.

24:03.609 --> 24:06.108
This is a really nice...

24:06.662 --> 24:07.832
penis.

24:07.989 --> 24:09.866
No, like how you do at work.

24:09.891 --> 24:11.411
Tell me you'd rather
take it up the ass

24:11.513 --> 24:14.053
than attend another meeting
at the Board of Regulators.

24:14.122 --> 24:16.412
Except with just
no regulators, okay?

24:16.497 --> 24:18.233
- Thank you.
- Okay.

24:18.280 --> 24:21.085
I would rather take it up the ass
with the Board of Regulators...

24:21.169 --> 24:22.499
No Board of Regulators.

24:22.545 --> 24:23.777
- I said that.
- This is stupid.

24:23.801 --> 24:25.751
I am not some
teased-haired casino cooze

24:25.849 --> 24:27.725
who will let you jizz all over her
face with a handful of chips.

24:27.749 --> 24:29.375
I like that. Keep going.
Tell me more.

24:29.427 --> 24:32.217
What's her name? Susan or...?
What's her deal?

24:32.263 --> 24:34.241
You know what the problem
with the Board of Regulators is?

24:34.265 --> 24:36.305
They are all appointed
by these partisan hacks

24:36.350 --> 24:37.680
who are antiquated as fuck.

24:37.727 --> 24:39.952
Okay, I'm sorry
I brought that up.

24:40.038 --> 24:42.473
It was going well before
that, though, I thought.

24:42.607 --> 24:44.267
Just forget it.

24:47.528 --> 24:49.198
There shouldn't even be a board.

24:49.238 --> 24:51.528
- Is it okay if I finish?
- I'm not your mother.

24:51.574 --> 24:53.534
Gary:
<i>Lookie-look who's here.</i>

24:53.576 --> 24:55.012
- Wow!
- Madam President.

24:55.037 --> 24:57.667
I haven't seen you forever.

24:57.791 --> 25:00.058
Well, I was gonna come by a
couple of times, but they said...

25:00.082 --> 25:02.292
I'm so sorry to hear about Uber.

25:02.335 --> 25:04.915
Oh, God. A bunch of dumb-ass
millennials, you know,

25:04.962 --> 25:06.752
too lazy to learn
how to drive drunk.

25:06.797 --> 25:08.207
- You want a drink?
- Absolutely.

25:08.257 --> 25:10.167
- Let me get that for you.
- No, I have it.

25:10.218 --> 25:11.468
Great.

25:11.510 --> 25:14.010
So, listen...

25:14.055 --> 25:15.795
I am...

25:15.848 --> 25:19.558
gonna be making a speech
at Mutual of Omaha on Monday

25:19.602 --> 25:22.629
and I was wondering if you
wanted to come with me.

25:23.958 --> 25:26.458
Um, ahem, is that the...

25:26.596 --> 25:30.403
The same Omaha that's a 20-minute
drive from Council Bluffs, Iowa,

25:30.488 --> 25:32.590
and the Madison Monroe dinner
on Monday night?

25:32.684 --> 25:33.817
Maybe.

25:35.451 --> 25:37.241
Son of a bitch, you're...

25:37.333 --> 25:39.294
gonna run for president.

25:40.085 --> 25:42.161
What if I were, hypothetically?

25:42.322 --> 25:43.652
- Hypothetically?
- Mm-hmm.

25:43.777 --> 25:45.997
Ma'am, you can't run
for president.

25:46.916 --> 25:48.693
<i>You don't have
the party's support,</i>

25:48.798 --> 25:50.701
you don't have
the donors' support.

25:50.802 --> 25:53.536
What if I told you
that I had Tanz on board,

25:53.648 --> 25:54.648
hypothetically?

25:54.762 --> 25:57.630
Shlomo Tanz is radioactive.

25:57.822 --> 25:59.669
He can read the newspaper
on the toilet

25:59.767 --> 26:01.057
by the light of his own shit.

26:01.102 --> 26:03.935
Okay, but, Ben, you and I...

26:04.553 --> 26:07.435
- could... we...
- No, no, I cannot.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.544
I'm... I'm out, okay?

26:09.860 --> 26:11.110
May God forgive me.

26:11.153 --> 26:14.295
I... I'm taking
the Jonah job with Kent.

26:14.448 --> 26:16.819
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I can't watch you lose again.

26:16.901 --> 26:19.686
There's nobody out there who wants
to see a Meyer comeback, Selina.

26:19.759 --> 26:22.662
It's... it's over.

26:26.502 --> 26:28.619
Well, I was speaking
hypothetically.

26:29.208 --> 26:32.038
I mean, you of all people
should know that, Ben.

26:32.219 --> 26:33.697
Jesus Christ, you know?

26:33.785 --> 26:35.705
I wanted you to come here
because I was wondering

26:35.784 --> 26:39.330
if you wanted to join the
board of my Meyer Fund for...

26:39.624 --> 26:42.124
AIDS and Adult Literacy.

26:42.309 --> 26:44.111
- Be an honor.
- Hmm.

26:44.166 --> 26:45.442
- Okay.
- Thank you, ma'am.

26:45.479 --> 26:46.627
Yeah.

26:46.674 --> 26:50.111
You know, maybe if we teach them
how to read a condom wrapper,

26:50.192 --> 26:52.236
they wouldn't get AIDS
in the first place.

26:52.361 --> 26:53.791
Okay. See?
There's hope.

26:53.864 --> 26:54.970
Mm.

26:57.412 --> 26:59.572
You know, ma'am,

26:59.903 --> 27:02.298
you're one of only 46
people who became...

27:02.370 --> 27:04.986
Good night, Ben.
Good night, good night.

27:05.087 --> 27:06.720
Good night.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.173
<i>( door opens )</i>

27:09.423 --> 27:11.291
<i>( dice rattling )</i>

27:11.922 --> 27:13.017
Hmm?

27:13.257 --> 27:15.658
<i>( Music playing )</i>

27:21.925 --> 27:24.854
Ma'am, we're all set for
private jets to Omaha on Monday

27:24.948 --> 27:26.371
and back from Council Bluffs
on Wednesday.

27:26.395 --> 27:28.355
We're coming back
from Omaha on Monday.

27:28.584 --> 27:30.124
Uh-oh.

27:31.622 --> 27:33.667
- Madam President.
- Hello.

27:35.214 --> 27:36.474
Welcome.

27:36.515 --> 27:37.804
Pilot: <i>Good morning.
This is Captain Stevens.</i>

27:37.828 --> 27:40.659
<i>I'd like to welcome you all
aboard flight 327,</i>

27:40.693 --> 27:42.003
<i>Omaha to New York.</i>

27:42.041 --> 27:43.140
Attendant: Right here,
Madam President.

27:43.164 --> 27:45.284
Do you want window or aisle?

27:45.638 --> 27:48.292
- I don't want anything here.
- Hmm.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.198
( jingle plays )

27:51.545 --> 27:54.026
Announcer: <i>"CBS This
Morning" with Jane McCabe.</i>

27:54.162 --> 27:57.604
<i>And introducing Danny Egan.</i>

27:57.843 --> 27:59.503
I'm Jane McCabe.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.848
And I'm Dan-ny Egan.

28:02.073 --> 28:04.009
And here's what's going on
in your world.

28:04.058 --> 28:06.526
Jane: <i>This morning, today
we start with a story...</i>

28:06.571 --> 28:09.321
Sir, I'm sorry, you're going to
need to gate-check your bag.

28:09.522 --> 28:10.847
It's complimentary.

28:10.981 --> 28:13.071
Huh?

28:13.116 --> 28:14.783
I need hand sanitizer.

28:14.901 --> 28:17.830
Ma'am!
Ma'am.

28:18.989 --> 28:20.486
Ugh.

28:21.703 --> 28:23.502
Hi.
