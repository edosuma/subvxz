00:12.479 --> 00:15.971
I can't believe you're moving.
Where is Vancouver, anyway?

00:16.049 --> 00:19.746
Do you know what happens to girls who
start high school with no best friend,

00:19.819 --> 00:22.913
no guy, and low social standing?

00:22.989 --> 00:25.822
Nothing.
Nothing ever happens to them.

00:26.826 --> 00:30.284
But look at it this way... you have
the whole summer to revise your image.

00:30.363 --> 00:33.093
I never truly had an image, did I?

00:33.166 --> 00:34.599
Start now.

00:49.516 --> 00:50.505
Bye!

00:50.583 --> 00:51.777
See you, guys!

00:53.553 --> 00:57.683
Julie, Hannah, hold on.
Take this. Here. There you go.

00:57.757 --> 01:00.419
What's this? I thought we were
done with junior high.

01:00.493 --> 01:03.087
It's the summer reading list.

01:03.163 --> 01:04.926
You read all these books?

01:04.998 --> 01:06.260
Yeah, many times.

01:06.332 --> 01:09.392
Really, Mr. Corrado,
you need to get out more.

01:10.236 --> 01:11.965
Okay, that's not funny!

01:12.038 --> 01:13.903
You two, slow down!

01:13.973 --> 01:16.339
Julie, party problem.

01:16.843 --> 01:20.006
Great. Staci's gonna go
to Liz's sleepover.

01:21.948 --> 01:23.415
Speak of the devils.

01:24.651 --> 01:27.950
Hey, Yancy,
my father's a lawyer.

01:28.021 --> 01:31.513
He could help you sue the diet pill
company for nonperformance.

01:38.198 --> 01:40.530
Do you want to come
to my sleepover?

01:40.600 --> 01:43.262
Me? Yeah, sure.
Absolutely.

01:43.336 --> 01:46.305
- It's tonight. Seven-ish.
- Cool.

01:54.914 --> 01:56.905
Last chance to see
a picture of me in a coma.

01:56.983 --> 01:58.848
I've got tubes in nasty places.

01:58.918 --> 02:01.216
You were barely in a coma.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.118
Three hours.

02:04.624 --> 02:08.151
Hey, hey, what's this?
Someone having a par-tay tonight?

02:08.228 --> 02:10.491
Par-tay, Jules!

02:10.562 --> 02:13.999
Keep it up, SpongeBob. You'll have
two pictures of yourself in a coma.

02:21.774 --> 02:25.904
Jules, I can't make your overnighter.
I'm doing the dance.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.537
The dance?

02:27.614 --> 02:29.514
The high school dance?

02:30.250 --> 02:32.411
Oh, right. Have fun.

02:35.488 --> 02:36.477
"Have fun"!

02:37.557 --> 02:40.082
How did Staci get so popular, anyways?

02:40.160 --> 02:41.957
We used to be best friends.

02:42.028 --> 02:43.962
That was elementary school.

02:44.030 --> 02:45.019
True.

02:45.098 --> 02:48.795
So, I think I have a solution.

02:48.868 --> 02:50.301
I'll just move with you.

02:50.370 --> 02:53.498
You have to stay put, kiddo,
hold up the tent.

02:55.341 --> 02:57.002
The tent won't be
the same without you.

02:58.711 --> 03:01.043
So this is our future?

03:01.114 --> 03:02.706
Your future.

03:02.782 --> 03:04.443
I still can't believe you're moving.

03:04.517 --> 03:07.213
How am I supposed to
do high school without you?

03:10.123 --> 03:11.647
There it is...

03:11.724 --> 03:13.783
the high school lunch spot.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.260
And there's
where I'll be sitting.

03:17.764 --> 03:19.095
Cool...

03:20.667 --> 03:22.225
uncool.

03:23.736 --> 03:25.260
Staci and Liz...

03:25.972 --> 03:27.030
me.

03:27.106 --> 03:29.768
Life is so predictable it kills me.

03:47.327 --> 03:50.455
Steve is so plush.

03:56.669 --> 04:01.129
Isn't it great?
He can't see me, not at all.

04:18.491 --> 04:20.618
I thought you'd never get home.

04:20.692 --> 04:23.355
We have a million things to do
before the party, Julie,

04:23.429 --> 04:27.991
so I stopped on my way home
and I bought all the stuff.

04:28.067 --> 04:30.433
Stuff? What stuff?

04:31.604 --> 04:34.368
Oh, Mom, not the Party Playhouse!

04:35.441 --> 04:38.672
We are having a ladybug party.

04:39.345 --> 04:41.210
We've got ladybug cups...

04:42.248 --> 04:43.840
ladybug plates...

04:44.417 --> 04:47.978
and a ladybug pi? Ata.

04:48.054 --> 04:50.648
Mom, I'm 14, not 4.

04:50.723 --> 04:53.886
I just thought your party should
have a theme, like they used to.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.622
Aren't these antenna boppers
just a hoot, Hannah?

04:56.696 --> 04:57.685
Look.

05:01.768 --> 05:03.599
Someone stole my bike.

05:04.737 --> 05:06.227
What happened to his car?

05:06.306 --> 05:07.295
Repossessed.

05:07.373 --> 05:09.603
We're all so proud.

05:09.676 --> 05:12.008
Maybe I should stay home tonight.

05:12.078 --> 05:14.171
No. Bad, Mom. You can't.

05:14.247 --> 05:15.305
And why not?

05:15.381 --> 05:17.941
Because we don't need
a babysitter.

05:18.017 --> 05:21.350
Besides, Dad'll be here.
He's a great enforcer.

05:21.921 --> 05:23.252
Slumber house rules.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.224
Oh, for the love of carbs,
do we have to...

05:26.292 --> 05:27.759
Slumber house rules.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.124
"No leaving the house,

05:29.195 --> 05:32.722
no boys,
no damaging important stuff."

05:32.799 --> 05:35.131
If there's any structural damage
to this house...

05:35.201 --> 05:37.226
So, is this the part
where you break into song?

05:37.303 --> 05:38.793
Honey, you ignore the house rules,

05:38.871 --> 05:40.862
you will stay home with your grandma
and help her sort wigs

05:40.940 --> 05:43.738
while the rest of us go to Hawaii...
without you.

05:43.810 --> 05:45.243
Are you serious?

05:45.311 --> 05:49.907
You would take that
and leave me?

05:49.982 --> 05:51.415
That, who is supposed to be at college

05:51.484 --> 05:54.180
setting a good example
for his younger sister?

05:55.254 --> 05:58.417
Yeah, well, college...

05:59.492 --> 06:02.017
Everyone was so serious.

06:02.095 --> 06:04.962
High school was great.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.828
Stay as long as you can.

06:08.267 --> 06:12.033
Please... please tell me
we have different fathers!

06:12.105 --> 06:14.005
Julie, enough.
Go to your room.

06:14.073 --> 06:16.405
Ren, go to your former room.

06:16.476 --> 06:18.467
And you, outside.

06:20.947 --> 06:23.814
My mom is so blindfolded.

06:25.218 --> 06:28.051
Look at what she bought me.

06:28.121 --> 06:30.021
Now, those are hot.

06:30.089 --> 06:32.683
She seriously thinks
I'm, like, 10 or something.

06:35.194 --> 06:37.219
Can I borrow five bucks?

06:37.296 --> 06:39.992
- Can you knock?
- Actually, I need 20.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.364
Can I borrow 50 bucks?

06:42.435 --> 06:45.404
Get a job.
Or better, go back to school!

06:46.839 --> 06:50.275
I am blooming!
I need a lock on my door!

06:56.249 --> 06:58.444
Hey. What's going on?

06:58.518 --> 07:00.145
Fried Twinkies.

07:01.387 --> 07:03.719
I wish I'd invented these. Wow.

07:03.790 --> 07:06.759
Honey, I feel so guilty leaving you
alone with the party tonight.

07:06.826 --> 07:08.157
Are you sure this is okay?

07:08.227 --> 07:10.889
Have fun, and while
you're gone, my love...

07:11.964 --> 07:14.194
I'm installing
the Aquapure system.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.134
Oh, honey, why don't you just
relax tonight? Our water's fine.

07:17.203 --> 07:20.604
Fine? Fine?
Let's just take a look at our water.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.537
Blue! Blue, okay?

07:26.612 --> 07:28.273
Know what that means?

07:28.347 --> 07:30.281
Our house is having a boy?

07:30.349 --> 07:32.180
I'll tell you what,

07:32.251 --> 07:34.242
I don't know what it means,
but I'm gonna find out,

07:34.320 --> 07:37.016
and I know it's not good,
it's not good for any of us.

07:38.424 --> 07:40.517
Okey-dokey. Well.

07:40.593 --> 07:42.117
I'm going now.

07:43.696 --> 07:45.163
Behave.

07:45.231 --> 07:46.289
Right.

07:47.366 --> 07:49.061
Go! Be merry!
Have fun, okay?

07:49.135 --> 07:50.500
All right.
Now, have a good time.

07:50.570 --> 07:52.060
And keep the music down, okay?

07:52.138 --> 07:55.232
I'm finally back on speaking terms
with the Mulligans, okay?

07:55.308 --> 07:56.297
Mom, go.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.673
What do you think
they do for fun?

08:02.748 --> 08:05.080
My mother doesn't do fun.

08:09.388 --> 08:11.879
Butt crack alert.

08:12.959 --> 08:13.948
Party!

09:22.261 --> 09:24.161
You're wearing that to the dance?

09:24.230 --> 09:25.697
We're skipping the dance.

09:26.766 --> 09:28.461
Skipping the dance?

09:37.810 --> 09:40.574
This is where we're going
instead of the dance?

09:41.581 --> 09:44.106
I spent all month
getting ready for this dance.

09:44.183 --> 09:45.616
That's pathetic.

09:46.619 --> 09:47.847
Come here.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.148
Stop it!

09:49.221 --> 09:51.451
You're crushing my Lulu Guinness.

09:51.524 --> 09:53.515
Maybe I should have
asked her out.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.458
Come on.

09:56.796 --> 09:59.788
You promised. You promised when
you graduated, we would hook up.

09:59.865 --> 10:03.130
And you promised
to take me to the dance.

10:03.202 --> 10:05.397
Get off me!

10:05.471 --> 10:06.460
Out!

10:06.539 --> 10:08.632
- What?
- Get out. We're over.

10:09.709 --> 10:10.971
Really?

10:11.043 --> 10:13.944
Yeah, really.
Have you forgotten who I am?

10:14.013 --> 10:15.708
Let me think.

10:15.781 --> 10:19.308
The second-string quarterback...
on the junior varsity.

10:23.823 --> 10:26.121
You'll be so ruined in high school.

10:47.013 --> 10:50.642
Liz? Change in plan.
I can't get you guys into the dance.

10:51.884 --> 10:55.081
Calm yourself.
I have new funness in mind.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.815
Start making a list.

11:26.485 --> 11:28.646
Hi, two large pepperoni,

11:28.721 --> 11:31.588
two with pineapple and barbecue,
and one with...

11:31.657 --> 11:34.421
- Anchovies!
- That is so rank!

11:34.493 --> 11:36.256
The dead little stinky fish.

11:36.328 --> 11:37.659
Okay, thanks.

11:38.664 --> 11:40.655
It better not be SpongeBob.

11:49.775 --> 11:55.077
So... who's responsible
for all the sound?

11:55.147 --> 11:57.274
You're not our usual Rent-a-Cop.

11:57.349 --> 11:59.510
Chuck had a breakdown.
Chuck was weak.

11:59.585 --> 12:01.212
This whole...

12:03.723 --> 12:08.387
This whole ZIP code is now my domain,
and I am hip to you, little missy.

12:08.461 --> 12:11.658
Got a call about excessive noise.

12:12.865 --> 12:14.958
Keep it down.

12:15.968 --> 12:18.732
Hello. May I?

12:25.010 --> 12:26.341
It's a Coke.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.080
It's a Coke.

12:36.155 --> 12:39.591
But you can't be too sure, 'cause
you kids are very crafty these days.

12:39.658 --> 12:42.183
Yeah, yuck. I'm gonna be
watching you, little yuck.

12:44.830 --> 12:48.266
- What's with this guy?
- Let me get it this time.

12:52.171 --> 12:53.536
What are you doing here?

12:53.606 --> 12:55.938
Todd and I hooked up.
So we decided to skip the dance.

12:56.008 --> 12:58.499
Okay, you guys
have done the makeovers,

12:58.577 --> 13:02.308
the website vandalism,
and the frozen bra, right?

13:02.381 --> 13:03.575
Um... yeah.

13:03.649 --> 13:05.810
So, let's get this gala started.

13:07.987 --> 13:10.353
Yeah. Send it.

13:10.422 --> 13:12.686
Question. What's going on?

13:12.758 --> 13:14.726
That was Liz.
She's having a party, too.

13:14.794 --> 13:15.783
We heard.

13:15.861 --> 13:18.625
So we decided to
put together a little hunt.

13:18.697 --> 13:20.289
Who are you?

13:20.366 --> 13:21.731
Yancy.

13:21.801 --> 13:25.328
I'm Yancy. We had
P.E. Together all year.

13:25.404 --> 13:27.395
You're orange.

13:27.473 --> 13:30.135
Oh, my God, Yancy,
you are orange.

13:30.209 --> 13:32.439
You used too much Presto Tan.

13:35.781 --> 13:38.511
Steve Phillips? Dream on.

13:39.718 --> 13:40.980
Turn on your web cam.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.748
We just gave each other
thongs with our names on them.

13:46.392 --> 13:47.882
Wicked. One for me?

13:47.960 --> 13:49.518
But of course.

13:51.463 --> 13:53.363
- Hey, Julie, did Mom leave?
- Get out!

13:53.432 --> 13:55.559
- I only found Dad.
- Go!

13:55.634 --> 13:58.068
My kingdom for a lock!

14:00.506 --> 14:01.939
Did you get the hunt list?

14:02.007 --> 14:03.031
Opening now.

14:03.108 --> 14:05.372
Hunt? Hunting what?

14:06.412 --> 14:08.209
Scavenger hunting.

14:08.280 --> 14:11.113
Oh, see, we're not allowed
to leave the hou...

14:11.183 --> 14:14.584
You have one of those
Polaroid sticker cameras, right?

14:14.653 --> 14:16.052
But of course.

14:16.121 --> 14:18.612
Use it to document the tasks.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.215
Here's the list.

14:20.292 --> 14:21.816
We start at 8:00, sharp as nails.

14:21.894 --> 14:25.352
We sketched in something
extra special for Jules.

14:25.431 --> 14:27.831
Special? What special?

14:27.900 --> 14:31.097
"Dress a window mannequin
at Old Navy in your own clothes.

14:31.170 --> 14:35.129
"Have a guy from datesafe. Com
buy you a drink at the Cosmo Club.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.971
"Get a security decal
off a PatrolTec car,

14:38.043 --> 14:39.908
and..."

14:39.979 --> 14:43.176
"Borrow a pair
of Steve Phillips' boxer shorts"?

14:43.249 --> 14:45.149
- No, no, no, no.
- What's in it for us?

14:45.217 --> 14:46.707
Thongs.

14:46.785 --> 14:49.185
- Pass.
- Double pass.

14:49.255 --> 14:50.916
- Unless...
- Hannah.

14:50.990 --> 14:52.924
...we make it interesting.

14:52.992 --> 14:54.289
Speak it.

14:54.360 --> 14:55.622
Lunch spot.

14:55.694 --> 14:58.595
Winning group
eats at the fountain next year,

14:58.664 --> 15:01.428
and losers eat at the Dumpsters.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.491
No prob.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.560
Hannah, can I
talk to you for a second?

15:11.777 --> 15:14.302
I cannot do the things on that list.

15:14.380 --> 15:15.870
I'll just eat Wonder Bread
by the Dumpsters

15:15.948 --> 15:17.245
with the rest of the frumps.

15:17.316 --> 15:18.806
Julie, focus.

15:18.884 --> 15:21.648
What do you want
more than anything in this world?

15:22.721 --> 15:24.450
Anything anything?

15:24.523 --> 15:27.185
Ultimate anything.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.592
- Steve.
- Exactly.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.688
Do you think
he eats by the Dumpsters?

15:32.765 --> 15:35.791
You could be sitting
right next to him at the fountain.

15:35.868 --> 15:39.429
And plus, if you don't do this,
everyone's gonna hear about it.

15:39.505 --> 15:41.336
We live in a suck universe

15:41.407 --> 15:44.103
where wearing the wrong sneakers
can make us life outcasts.

15:44.176 --> 15:45.370
I know, but...

15:45.444 --> 15:48.436
You and I both know that we're
not just talking about a lunch spot.

15:48.514 --> 15:51.677
We're talking about
who you're going to be in high school.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.342
You have to do this.

15:55.587 --> 15:57.578
I hate it when you sound right.

15:57.656 --> 16:01.558
Only, we can't leave the house.
My mom will cancel Hawaii, and...

16:03.462 --> 16:04.690
Follow.

16:09.868 --> 16:12.166
What happened to your room?

16:12.237 --> 16:14.865
Oh, is it different?
I hadn't noticed.

16:14.940 --> 16:16.430
Mom redid it.

16:16.508 --> 16:18.840
They weren't expecting him back so soon.

16:19.912 --> 16:20.901
What's that?

16:20.980 --> 16:22.504
Oh, that?

16:22.581 --> 16:27.314
That is where my Miss Hawaiian Tropic
standee once stood.

16:27.386 --> 16:29.980
Now... a yoga zone.

16:30.055 --> 16:34.048
And have you seen
the new craft corner?

16:35.728 --> 16:37.252
I had a dream about these.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.093
They were trying to kill me.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.897
My glory days have been erased.

16:42.968 --> 16:47.098
My beer cap collection,
my cheerleader hate mail...

16:51.143 --> 16:52.610
I think I have a fever.

16:52.678 --> 16:55.169
Getting back to the real world...

16:55.247 --> 16:57.010
...we have a proposition.

16:58.083 --> 17:00.017
It involves money.

17:00.085 --> 17:01.109
My money.

17:01.186 --> 17:05.417
"Your money" is my favorite word.

17:08.426 --> 17:11.362
I had to promise Ren fifty
of my Hot Dog on a Stick dollars

17:11.430 --> 17:12.624
to cover for us.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.858
She's getting us
a neato date for tonight.

17:14.933 --> 17:16.161
"Neato"?

17:16.234 --> 17:18.135
Pull yourself into the century.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.636
Is this a good idea?

17:19.704 --> 17:21.137
This site is totally safe.

17:22.141 --> 17:24.268
Okay, what should our name be?

17:26.111 --> 17:27.237
June.

17:27.311 --> 17:28.609
Occupation?

17:28.680 --> 17:29.669
Tree surgeon.

17:30.649 --> 17:31.638
What?

17:31.717 --> 17:33.582
Swimsuit model.

17:33.652 --> 17:36.553
Okay, we're brunette, 5' 7".

17:36.622 --> 17:38.647
- Hobbies?
- Dancing.

17:38.724 --> 17:39.952
Sewing.

17:40.025 --> 17:41.583
Eating cheese.

17:42.628 --> 17:43.959
Kidding.

17:44.029 --> 17:45.656
Sitting...

17:45.731 --> 17:47.221
on the beach.

17:47.299 --> 17:49.563
"I'm looking for someone
way gorgeous

17:49.635 --> 17:51.660
to buy me a drink tonight
at the Cosmo Club."

17:51.737 --> 17:54.570
Wait. We have to get
into the Cosmo Club?

17:54.640 --> 17:58.235
And I'll be wearing
a paisley scarf.

17:58.310 --> 18:02.178
How exactly are you going to be
a tall, brunette swimsuit model?

18:02.247 --> 18:04.181
I'm not. You are.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.409
Me?

18:05.484 --> 18:06.849
Yes, you.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.444
- Me?
- Is she broken?

18:09.521 --> 18:11.216
She's fine.

18:11.290 --> 18:13.656
The 'net rocks.
We have a winner.

18:13.725 --> 18:14.851
Already?

18:14.927 --> 18:16.417
"Dave. Handsome. Ooh.

18:16.495 --> 18:20.659
Hobbies: Reading,
hiking, sunsets, and cliff diving."

18:20.732 --> 18:22.290
He's perfect.

18:22.367 --> 18:24.597
Perfect? How is he perfect?

18:24.670 --> 18:26.763
He'll be wearing a brown jacket
with a red tie.

18:26.839 --> 18:29.103
What does the blue ribbon mean?

18:29.174 --> 18:30.698
It means he's been
verified by the site.

18:30.776 --> 18:31.765
He's okay.

18:31.844 --> 18:34.312
And plus we'll all be
sticking together, right?

18:34.379 --> 18:35.607
Of course.

18:35.681 --> 18:37.046
Done.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.640
Hork- hork. Outside.

18:38.717 --> 18:39.877
Got the Beemer.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.442
Let's get outta here.

18:41.520 --> 18:42.544
Coming.

18:44.089 --> 18:45.386
See ya.

18:47.025 --> 18:49.459
Wait, where are you going?

18:49.528 --> 18:52.861
You didn't for serious think I was
going to be on your team, did you?

18:52.931 --> 18:54.899
First team to complete all the tasks

18:54.967 --> 18:56.832
and show up
at the high school parking lot

18:56.902 --> 18:58.369
wins the spot.

18:58.437 --> 19:00.530
But... we don't have a car.

19:01.907 --> 19:04.137
Ther you lose.

19:04.209 --> 19:07.542
We'll get a car,
and we'll get the fountain spot.

19:07.613 --> 19:09.046
Pleathers.

19:09.114 --> 19:10.877
Posers.

19:25.664 --> 19:28.098
Hey, how come Liz can drive?

19:28.167 --> 19:29.759
She already has her learner's permit.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.826
She was held back a year.

19:31.904 --> 19:34.395
She is so lucky.

19:35.774 --> 19:37.401
I blame you.

19:47.953 --> 19:50.444
That was excruciating.

19:50.956 --> 19:52.583
Let's dominate.

20:05.470 --> 20:08.598
I look like my mother.

20:08.674 --> 20:09.936
Hold on.

20:21.687 --> 20:24.451
Now... you look like
your mother 20 years ago,

20:24.523 --> 20:26.388
with fashion sense.

20:26.458 --> 20:28.289
I think I can get us a car.

20:32.264 --> 20:33.253
Speak.

20:38.136 --> 20:40.570
Papa Bear is still under the sink.

20:40.639 --> 20:43.506
Repeat, Papa Bear
is still under the sink.

20:43.575 --> 20:44.667
Over.

20:44.743 --> 20:48.008
Ren, we are still inside the house.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.947
Do not call unless it's an emergency.

20:51.016 --> 20:53.109
10-4. Over and out.

20:58.357 --> 21:00.257
Do you guys think
we should be doing this?

21:02.594 --> 21:03.583
Let's go.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.131
I'm pretty stuck.

21:51.209 --> 21:52.233
Pull.

22:02.921 --> 22:05.253
Look at my dad.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.724
He is so oblivious.

22:09.594 --> 22:11.494
Help.

22:17.469 --> 22:20.461
- Great rescue, guys.
- Sorry.

22:20.539 --> 22:21.904
Come on.

22:29.815 --> 22:31.783
Destination Hottie House in sight.

22:35.654 --> 22:36.780
I'm okay.

22:47.499 --> 22:51.367
Officially, the smallest car
I've ever seen.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.238
It looks like a clown car.

22:56.308 --> 22:57.798
It's an electric car.

22:57.876 --> 23:00.970
It's made out of this really hard
recycled stuff.

23:01.046 --> 23:04.038
My dad taught me how to drive it
in the mall parking lot,

23:04.116 --> 23:06.141
said I could use it for an emergency,

23:06.218 --> 23:10.086
which it kinda seems like this is.

23:19.364 --> 23:21.059
That's my hand!

23:21.133 --> 23:23.260
No, sadly, that's my hand.

23:39.651 --> 23:42.814
Fake food's come a long way
in the last ten years.

23:53.331 --> 23:54.662
Wrong room.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.433
All I can find are these scrunchies.

24:05.510 --> 24:07.137
Yeah, and socks.

24:07.212 --> 24:10.340
Cha-ching! I found bras!

24:11.116 --> 24:12.208
Yeah!

24:12.284 --> 24:16.948
Dude, clue. Don't you think
there's something missing?

24:19.357 --> 24:20.949
What?

24:21.026 --> 24:23.187
The girls!

24:23.261 --> 24:27.197
Right, right.
Where are the babes?

24:27.265 --> 24:28.459
Gone.

24:28.533 --> 24:30.057
Gone?

24:30.135 --> 24:31.932
This diary raid skeaves!

24:34.272 --> 24:36.502
Girls! Everything all right up there?

25:15.814 --> 25:18.374
If you tell anyone about this...

25:19.451 --> 25:21.180
I will so injure you.

25:28.627 --> 25:32.222
Looks like we're going
on a scavenger hunt, men.

25:42.807 --> 25:44.570
That guy just waved at me.

25:48.480 --> 25:52.348
I am so smushed, I can't even
return a wave at a cute guy.

25:52.417 --> 25:54.146
Cute guys never wave at me.

25:54.219 --> 25:57.416
Oh, what am I saying?
No guys ever wave at me.

25:57.489 --> 25:58.717
I'm fat.

25:58.790 --> 26:01.725
You are not fat. Who told you
that you were fat?

26:01.793 --> 26:03.852
Uh... Staci and Liz.

26:03.929 --> 26:07.023
I heard they have scales
in their gym lockers.

26:07.098 --> 26:09.931
They do. They made me
stand on it in front of everyone.

26:10.001 --> 26:12.094
It was the worst moment of my life.

26:12.170 --> 26:13.330
That's hideous.

26:14.339 --> 26:17.570
Yancy, would you rather eat
celery or a brownie?

26:17.642 --> 26:19.576
What is that, a trick question?

26:19.644 --> 26:20.633
Exactly.

26:20.712 --> 26:23.806
So you'll just date guys
who like brownies.

26:25.383 --> 26:28.944
Okay. First on the list,
mannequins.

26:33.959 --> 26:35.790
They look so cute in your clothes.

26:35.860 --> 26:36.849
Smile!

26:43.068 --> 26:44.330
Good luck.

26:44.402 --> 26:46.097
Keep it.

26:48.607 --> 26:52.202
<i>Attertior. shoppers. Old Navy</i>
<i>will be closing ir five minutes.</i>

26:52.277 --> 26:53.676
They locked it.

26:53.745 --> 26:54.973
Of course they did.

26:55.046 --> 26:57.207
There's another
display window over there.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.271
Let's go.

27:02.921 --> 27:04.047
They're guys.

27:04.122 --> 27:07.057
I don't think they're gonna fit
into our miniskirts.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.888
We have to try.

27:08.960 --> 27:09.949
Let's go.

27:26.978 --> 27:27.967
Freeze!

28:17.629 --> 28:21.895
Who would design this guy?
He's got thunder thighs.

28:41.319 --> 28:44.083
Okay, we got it. Ready?

28:44.155 --> 28:45.213
Smile!

28:45.290 --> 28:46.416
Hey!

28:47.025 --> 28:48.356
I see you!

28:51.062 --> 28:52.757
And I got ya!

28:58.837 --> 29:01.465
Okay, come back in here!

29:04.008 --> 29:05.600
Open up this door!

29:09.180 --> 29:10.807
Bye!

29:10.882 --> 29:13.976
Oh, that is so not cool!

29:27.599 --> 29:29.464
All right, I'm coming.

29:29.534 --> 29:32.264
Okay, here you go.
Thanks, man.

29:32.337 --> 29:34.703
You girls better eat
all this pizza.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.709
I'll deliver those pies to 'em.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.644
You're gonna take the pizzas
up to your sister?

29:42.714 --> 29:45.376
Dad, you have
Aquapure momentum.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.281
Don't stop now.

29:47.352 --> 29:50.617
I do. Yeah. All right.

29:50.688 --> 29:52.849
As a matter of fact, you're gonna be
the first one to taste the new water.

29:52.924 --> 29:53.948
Let's go. Come on.

29:57.562 --> 29:59.223
- Oh, my gosh.
- What?

29:59.297 --> 30:00.286
The pizzas!

30:01.900 --> 30:03.367
So you're done?

30:03.434 --> 30:05.163
One more adjustment and I will be.

30:05.236 --> 30:06.225
All right.

30:08.907 --> 30:10.670
Yeah?

30:10.742 --> 30:12.175
Did the pizzas come?

30:13.945 --> 30:16.675
M y so ocos say yos

30:16.748 --> 30:18.579
You have to make them
all disappear.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.208
What's the offer?

30:20.285 --> 30:22.048
- Laundry.
- Keep talking.

30:22.120 --> 30:23.246
<i>Your laurdry.</i>

30:23.321 --> 30:25.516
I will do your laundry for a month.

30:25.590 --> 30:27.319
Done.

30:29.427 --> 30:30.519
Business deal?

30:30.595 --> 30:32.324
Exactly.

30:32.397 --> 30:33.386
Good for you.

30:34.399 --> 30:37.334
All right, this is gonna change
the way you look at water.

30:43.341 --> 30:44.899
You first.

30:47.345 --> 30:49.779
I gotta just check the line.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.008
Good thought.

30:56.120 --> 30:57.610
There's no place to park.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.953
Check it...
he's letting in the pleathers.

31:00.024 --> 31:03.016
You guys, we're never
gonna beat them.

31:03.094 --> 31:05.756
Okay, try parking around the corner.
We'll be quick.

31:12.637 --> 31:14.036
We're throwing 'em out.

31:15.039 --> 31:17.303
We're not gonna eat all these...

31:17.375 --> 31:19.366
till we're sick...

31:20.445 --> 31:22.879
writhing on the floor in pain.

31:24.816 --> 31:26.647
Go.

31:32.457 --> 31:34.652
This is so good.
I'm gonna kill you.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.334
We're with them,
the girls you just let in.

31:44.402 --> 31:46.597
Yeah, the other girls.

31:46.671 --> 31:48.400
What are you doing here?

31:48.473 --> 31:49.838
Scavenger hunting.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.102
Okay, no.

31:51.175 --> 31:53.769
All right, get gone, all of you.

31:53.845 --> 31:56.006
- Hey.
- This is so not fair.

31:56.080 --> 31:59.447
I don't have to be fair.
I have the pretty rope.

31:59.517 --> 32:01.007
Now scram!

32:23.041 --> 32:27.137
I'll bet your date's inside right now
buying Staci a drink.

32:27.211 --> 32:29.975
Date? You have a date?

32:58.409 --> 33:00.741
Oh, this rocks!

33:00.812 --> 33:02.575
Look!

33:02.647 --> 33:04.410
They're about to get their picture!

33:05.783 --> 33:07.375
We have to find Dave.

33:08.386 --> 33:10.183
Hey, is that...

33:10.254 --> 33:12.722
Mr. Corrado?!

33:12.790 --> 33:16.089
Now there are no surprises
left in this world.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.991
Corrado goes clubbing?

33:19.464 --> 33:21.489
Okay, focus on finding Dave.

33:21.566 --> 33:24.034
Now, what exactly is he
supposed to be wearing?

33:24.102 --> 33:26.002
A brown jacket

33:26.070 --> 33:28.504
with a red tie.

33:28.573 --> 33:29.562
Oh, my gosh!

33:29.640 --> 33:32.905
You're wrong. There is
one surprise left in this world.

33:32.977 --> 33:35.207
- Mr. Corrado's my date!
- What?!

33:35.279 --> 33:36.769
He'll report us for sure.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.440
Let's go.

33:38.516 --> 33:40.746
Excuse us, excuse us!

33:44.088 --> 33:45.350
June! June!

33:45.423 --> 33:49.052
- He's seen me!
- Your scarf... get rid of it!

33:50.128 --> 33:51.390
You dropped this.

33:51.462 --> 33:52.451
No, I didn't.

33:52.530 --> 33:53.895
- Yes.
- No.

33:53.965 --> 33:55.899
- Keep it.
- No!

33:55.967 --> 33:57.457
Uh... June.

33:59.670 --> 34:00.659
No, sorry.

34:00.738 --> 34:04.868
Well, you're the only one here
with a paisley scarf, so...

34:04.942 --> 34:06.910
No, I'm sorry.
That's not me.

34:06.978 --> 34:10.777
Okay, I know I might be
a disappointment physically,

34:10.848 --> 34:13.043
but I have great wit.

34:19.357 --> 34:20.790
Hi.

34:20.858 --> 34:22.985
Would you like a drink?

34:24.062 --> 34:25.051
Sure.

34:27.697 --> 34:28.995
What would you like?

34:29.067 --> 34:30.556
A Chunky Monkey.

34:31.636 --> 34:33.570
Isn't that a milkshake?

34:33.638 --> 34:34.969
Oh, um...

34:40.545 --> 34:42.342
What?! Are you crazy?

34:42.413 --> 34:43.471
Excuse me?

34:51.155 --> 34:53.851
A sex on the beach. My fave.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.358
Oh. Two.

34:56.726 --> 35:01.323
So, what's it like
being a swimsuit model?

35:01.399 --> 35:03.492
Um... cold.

35:04.569 --> 35:06.594
Well, yeah.

35:09.340 --> 35:12.867
Have we met before?
Your laugh is so familiar.

35:12.944 --> 35:13.933
My laugh?

35:14.011 --> 35:16.172
Actually, it's not my laugh.

35:16.247 --> 35:19.774
You see, I'm trying out different laughs
until I find the right one.

35:19.851 --> 35:21.182
What do you think of this one?

35:26.691 --> 35:27.953
Here's your drinks.

35:28.025 --> 35:29.492
Can I see some I.D.?

35:29.560 --> 35:30.891
My I.D.?

35:30.962 --> 35:34.864
Oh, um, I left it in my limo.

35:35.766 --> 35:37.495
Sorry.

35:37.568 --> 35:39.365
Julie.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.636
Hi, Mr. Corrado.

35:49.714 --> 35:51.875
A swimsuit model?

35:54.752 --> 35:59.746
This is so typical. I either
get stood up or worse... and this is worse!

35:59.824 --> 36:01.382
How did you ever get in here?

36:01.459 --> 36:04.189
It's a long story,
but the cheat-sheet version is,

36:04.262 --> 36:06.730
I'm on a scavenger hunt
for a lunch spot.

36:10.801 --> 36:12.735
The fountain.

36:12.803 --> 36:15.101
How do you know about the fountain?

36:15.173 --> 36:17.164
I'm not that old.

36:17.241 --> 36:19.072
I went to Abbott High School, too.

36:19.944 --> 36:22.572
Never did get to
sit at the fountain, though.

36:23.748 --> 36:25.716
Okay, get going.

36:25.783 --> 36:27.876
Actually, could you buy me a drink?

36:27.952 --> 36:30.113
A soda would fulfill the hunt list.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.088
But I have to get a picture of it.

36:32.156 --> 36:34.215
I should have known that
you would be nearby.

36:34.292 --> 36:37.784
Two ginger ales for these two.

36:37.862 --> 36:39.295
With olives.

36:39.363 --> 36:40.523
It's very cosmopolitan.

36:47.805 --> 36:50.467
Hey, sweet thing.
Wanna dance?

36:50.541 --> 36:53.669
When hell freezes over... twice.

36:55.980 --> 36:56.969
She likes me.

37:18.536 --> 37:21.835
Hey... do you want to sneak in?

37:21.906 --> 37:24.568
No, thanks.
I'm waiting for someone.

37:24.642 --> 37:26.109
Your boyfriend.

37:26.177 --> 37:27.542
My boyfriend?

37:27.612 --> 37:29.807
No, I don't have a boyfriend.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.007
Playing hard to get?

37:32.083 --> 37:35.883
I'm just sitting here.
I'm not playing anything.

37:35.953 --> 37:39.013
Well, I gotta go to another gig.
Their speaker blew.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.615
That's what I do during the summer,
I move speakers.

37:41.692 --> 37:47.653
It's not, like, my life goal or anything,
but, you know, it's money.

37:47.732 --> 37:49.825
That's nice.

37:51.435 --> 37:53.096
Why are you talking to me?

37:53.170 --> 37:54.194
What do you mean?

37:54.272 --> 37:56.137
Well, guys never talk to me.

37:56.207 --> 38:00.803
I mean, sometimes they ask me to hold
the door for them, but that's about it.

38:00.878 --> 38:02.607
What's your name?

38:02.680 --> 38:04.511
- Yancy.
- Peter.

38:04.582 --> 38:07.483
And I would never ask you
to hold a door.

38:17.762 --> 38:21.459
What's with you?
Your face is all glad-Iooking.

38:21.532 --> 38:24.023
A guy...
a really cute guy...

38:24.101 --> 38:29.300
and he talked to me like a guy
talks to a girl that he maybe might like.

38:29.373 --> 38:30.567
Where'd he go?

38:30.641 --> 38:32.370
He left.

38:32.443 --> 38:35.537
And I'll probably never,
ever see him again.

38:35.613 --> 38:37.808
This is the worst night of my life.

38:38.816 --> 38:41.307
Your girls are drinking
with Mr. Corrado.

38:41.385 --> 38:43.580
- Total grode.
- Pathetic.

38:48.059 --> 38:49.686
Okay.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.728
You have to leave.
You girls shouldn't be here.

38:51.796 --> 38:54.822
Mr. Corrado, some female-type advice...

38:54.899 --> 38:57.026
Should I be afraid?

38:57.101 --> 38:59.035
Loosen your tie.

39:02.907 --> 39:04.306
Come here.

39:14.919 --> 39:16.352
Looks good.

39:19.924 --> 39:21.186
Who would have guessed?

39:21.258 --> 39:22.748
Hi.

39:23.928 --> 39:25.190
Do you want to dance?

39:28.399 --> 39:30.458
Yeah. Sure.

39:36.941 --> 39:38.670
We still have a chance
at winning. Let's go.

39:49.053 --> 39:51.647
I think I just had a stroke.

39:51.722 --> 39:54.156
- What?
- Up there on that platform.

39:56.794 --> 39:58.955
- Is that...?
- My mother!

39:59.029 --> 40:02.157
What is she doing?
This is like Moms Gore Wild.

40:02.233 --> 40:06.169
She can't... wiggle... like that.
She's a mother.

40:06.237 --> 40:08.728
She uses Saran Wrap.
She makes mac and cheese.

40:08.806 --> 40:10.774
She drives a Volvo.

40:12.810 --> 40:17.509
Yeah, older babeage,
shaking her boo-tay.

40:19.583 --> 40:21.608
Do you think my dad
knows about this?

40:21.685 --> 40:23.744
Oh, this is horrible!
I mean, my mom's a...

40:24.755 --> 40:26.848
Who is she?

40:32.696 --> 40:35.426
Whoever she is,
she's headed this way. Let's go.

40:35.499 --> 40:36.659
Come on.

40:36.734 --> 40:37.723
Was I?

40:37.802 --> 40:39.360
Yeah, you were just shaking!

40:39.437 --> 40:40.426
Yes.

40:42.873 --> 40:44.773
What is that?

40:44.842 --> 40:46.469
I think it's my scarf.

40:46.544 --> 40:48.978
Yeah, but you weren't wearing a scarf.

40:49.046 --> 40:50.536
I know.

41:01.792 --> 41:04.784
Gabby!
Gabby, who did you see?

41:04.862 --> 41:07.387
I'm not sure.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.365
Oh, shoot. No reception.

41:09.433 --> 41:10.764
I have to make a call.

41:13.971 --> 41:16.565
I'm beyond dead.
She's calling Dad.

41:16.640 --> 41:17.800
Ren will cover.

41:17.875 --> 41:19.604
She's gonna want to
talk to me.

41:19.677 --> 41:24.137
Hello! Is anyone else concerned
that we're sitting in trash?

41:30.654 --> 41:34.681
Yeah, so, anyway...
oh, my God, did I tell you?

41:34.758 --> 41:36.885
I have to get home before...

41:38.062 --> 41:40.622
This cannot happen.

41:41.765 --> 41:44.063
Really okay.

41:46.670 --> 41:48.433
Where to next?

42:07.925 --> 42:10.792
All right, so I'll see you later,
hopefully. All right. Bye.

42:25.209 --> 42:26.574
Okay, so I'll see you
in a few minutes?

42:26.644 --> 42:28.407
All right. Okay, bye-bye.

42:28.479 --> 42:30.606
Oh, wait. No way. Really?

42:42.326 --> 42:43.918
Who was that?

43:12.656 --> 43:14.783
Oh, come on.
Come on, come on.

43:24.802 --> 43:25.894
Twinkie, yeah.

43:42.386 --> 43:43.375
Hello?

43:43.454 --> 43:45.115
<i>Hi. Sweetheart.</i>

43:45.189 --> 43:47.316
Are the girls there?

43:47.391 --> 43:49.188
They're here, of course!

43:49.259 --> 43:50.453
Have you seen them?

43:50.527 --> 43:51.516
Yeah.

44:14.618 --> 44:15.607
SpongeBob.

44:16.954 --> 44:18.717
Where else would they be?

44:20.591 --> 44:21.580
Yeah.

44:22.660 --> 44:24.992
Oh, it's all coming together.

44:25.062 --> 44:26.893
Where would they be?

44:26.964 --> 44:28.989
They're great.

44:33.137 --> 44:34.866
Hey, hey, hey! Turn it off!

44:34.938 --> 44:36.371
Look, l...

44:36.440 --> 44:40.001
No, no, no! Turn it off!
No, turn it off!

44:40.077 --> 44:41.066
I didn't do it!

44:41.145 --> 44:42.134
Off!

44:42.212 --> 44:43.543
Thank you!

44:43.614 --> 44:46.082
Honey, it sounds like
we're being attacked.

44:46.150 --> 44:49.244
What? Attacked? Oh, no.

44:49.319 --> 44:55.349
No! The next- door neighbor, the hose
was going all over into our yard.

44:58.529 --> 45:00.690
Just bring the phone
up to Julie's room.

45:03.100 --> 45:04.260
Julie...

45:04.334 --> 45:06.802
your mom's on the phone.

45:10.941 --> 45:11.930
Jules?

45:14.812 --> 45:16.803
Yeah, Dad?

45:16.880 --> 45:18.711
Your mom's on the phone.

45:23.120 --> 45:24.553
Hello?

45:24.621 --> 45:27.715
Hi. Is everything okay?

45:27.791 --> 45:29.622
Yeah, Mom, everything's fine.

45:29.693 --> 45:31.160
So what are you girls up to?

45:31.228 --> 45:32.217
Stuff.

45:32.296 --> 45:33.285
<i>What stuff?</i>

45:33.363 --> 45:34.921
Just stuff, okay?

45:34.998 --> 45:36.625
Julie, need I remind you...?

45:36.700 --> 45:39.828
<i>Mom. H krow all your rules...
no moving. No smiling</i>.

45:39.903 --> 45:40.892
No breathing.

45:40.971 --> 45:43.235
<i>Honey. Those rules</i>
<i>are for your own good.</i>

45:43.307 --> 45:45.605
You girls should be getting
to bed now, anyway.

45:45.676 --> 45:48.975
Bed? It's barely 9:30.
How old do you think we are?

45:49.046 --> 45:50.035
Honey, why is it...?

45:50.114 --> 45:51.945
<i>Why don't you just freeze me
<i>ir a time capsule?</i></i>

45:52.015 --> 45:53.676
That way I stay little forever.

45:53.751 --> 45:56.515
Okay, I'm going now.
Behave. Goodbye.

46:04.928 --> 46:06.520
That was way too close.

46:07.498 --> 46:09.693
I'm freaking exhausted.

46:12.703 --> 46:15.137
I need to go back to college
and get some rest.

46:16.607 --> 46:19.337
I don't know how to say this,
but thanks.

46:19.409 --> 46:22.242
And can you cover for us
for just a little longer?

46:23.547 --> 46:25.538
Go be a teenager.

46:26.950 --> 46:28.440
It ends too soon.

46:29.953 --> 46:33.354
And it gets replaced
by ribbons and lampshades.

46:45.302 --> 46:46.633
Steve's house.

46:48.238 --> 46:49.227
Uh-oh.

46:49.306 --> 46:51.501
Define "uh-oh."

46:51.575 --> 46:53.634
I think the car needs charging.

46:53.710 --> 46:57.043
What? We ran out of juice
in front of Steve's house?

46:57.114 --> 47:00.083
It has a quick charge function.
I just need a plug.

47:00.150 --> 47:02.311
A plug?

47:02.386 --> 47:03.785
Calm yourself.

47:03.854 --> 47:07.221
We'll take care of the car,
you just go get his boxers.

47:07.291 --> 47:09.816
Wait... why do I have to
boost his boxers?

47:09.893 --> 47:14.489
Are you kidding? The only reason this
is even on the list is because of you.

47:14.565 --> 47:16.999
She's right.
This one's all you.

47:18.402 --> 47:19.835
Do you think he's in there?

47:19.903 --> 47:22.667
It's almost ten.
He might be at the dance by now.

47:22.739 --> 47:24.832
Or he might be inside getting ready.

47:24.908 --> 47:28.002
I mean, no one great
shows up before ten.

47:28.078 --> 47:29.477
Thanks for that.

47:39.790 --> 47:42.258
I can't do this.
Let's go home. We lose.

47:42.326 --> 47:44.055
You are Julie...

47:44.127 --> 47:46.391
great knees, powerful brain.

47:46.463 --> 47:48.294
You can do this.

47:48.365 --> 47:50.925
"Great knees"?
"Powerful brain"?

47:51.001 --> 47:53.299
Is that supposed to
make me feel better?

47:53.370 --> 47:55.065
What do you care anyway?

47:55.138 --> 47:56.935
You're moving.

47:57.007 --> 47:59.066
That's why I care.

47:59.142 --> 48:02.407
Julie, I know you can do this.

48:19.363 --> 48:21.695
Ugh! Serious ugh!

48:23.600 --> 48:24.589
Got 'em!

48:25.602 --> 48:26.796
Here she comes!

48:33.443 --> 48:34.671
She did it.

48:34.745 --> 48:37.145
She actually went inside.

48:37.214 --> 48:40.809
This is gonna be
worth the price of admission.

48:40.884 --> 48:43.409
PatrolTec Security, please.

48:43.487 --> 48:49.357
Hello, I'd like to report
a suspicious person at 947 Oak Lane.

48:49.426 --> 48:50.620
Thank you.

48:50.694 --> 48:51.683
Done.

49:11.748 --> 49:13.045
You think that's the girl?

49:14.117 --> 49:15.607
Hard to tell. It was dark.

49:37.941 --> 49:39.932
A plug! I found a plug!

49:49.786 --> 49:51.219
Of course.

49:51.288 --> 49:53.552
You know, I think this is the girl,

49:53.623 --> 49:55.716
and I recognize her from somewhere.

49:55.792 --> 49:58.522
I think I knew her
in my grade school or something.

50:02.599 --> 50:03.588
So?

50:03.667 --> 50:05.760
She grew up nice.

50:05.836 --> 50:08.532
Drama club, basketball,
debate team.

50:08.605 --> 50:13.235
Hobbies... hot dogs,
skateboarding, and napping.

50:13.310 --> 50:15.505
Steve, what are you doing?

50:15.579 --> 50:18.241
There's, like, a gym full of girls
waiting for you.

50:20.484 --> 50:23.476
Basketball, boarding, and dogs.

50:25.922 --> 50:28.413
Hey, hurry up!
Dance ends at midnight!

51:08.832 --> 51:11.164
Okay, we can almost reach.

51:12.235 --> 51:13.998
Come on.

51:14.071 --> 51:15.504
Okay, stop!

51:16.673 --> 51:17.833
Stop pushing!

51:17.908 --> 51:19.500
We're not pushing anymore!

51:26.249 --> 51:28.183
Oh, no!

51:31.888 --> 51:33.219
What the heck was that?

51:44.067 --> 51:45.364
Okay, here we go.

51:46.369 --> 51:47.495
Oh, flashlight!

51:47.571 --> 51:50.062
Gonna leave a mark.
There we go.

51:55.345 --> 51:58.337
Look, someone smacked
into the PatrolTec guy!

51:58.415 --> 52:01.145
- Sweet!
- I know.

52:01.218 --> 52:03.413
Securing the perimeter.

52:06.923 --> 52:09.118
There's the suspect.
Hey, you!

52:09.192 --> 52:10.557
PatrolTec Security!

52:11.695 --> 52:13.356
All right, I've spotted you!

52:13.430 --> 52:15.796
Security officer on the premises!
Right here!

52:15.866 --> 52:17.959
And we win.

52:18.034 --> 52:19.467
We always win.

52:19.536 --> 52:21.299
Is there no one to challenge us?

52:21.371 --> 52:22.838
Let's scoot over to the dance.

52:22.906 --> 52:24.737
What's the point?

52:24.808 --> 52:27.072
It's obvious they're not even
going to finish.

52:27.144 --> 52:29.408
Let's just go get juicers.

52:29.479 --> 52:34.007
Is there a reason you don't want to
go to the dance... like a Todd reason?

52:34.084 --> 52:36.382
No. There's no Todd reason.

52:36.453 --> 52:37.886
Then what's your affliction?

52:37.954 --> 52:40.388
I'm sure one of my sister's friends
can get us in.

52:40.457 --> 52:42.118
Let's just go.

52:45.428 --> 52:47.760
I got a suspicious person call
at this address,

52:47.831 --> 52:50.857
and you look suspicious to me.

52:50.934 --> 52:54.563
Hey... haven't I seen you before?

52:54.638 --> 52:56.503
I don't think so.

52:56.573 --> 52:58.507
What's your name?

52:58.575 --> 52:59.906
Julie.

52:59.976 --> 53:04.345
And why are you damp, Julie?

53:04.414 --> 53:07.110
I was surprised by some sprinklers.

53:13.990 --> 53:17.289
- What have we here?
- I can explain.

53:17.360 --> 53:19.521
I doubt it. Follow me.

53:20.697 --> 53:22.892
Hey, where's the tiny green car?

53:22.966 --> 53:23.955
What?

53:24.034 --> 53:25.763
The tiny car that hit me?

53:33.143 --> 53:35.236
Not even a dent.

53:35.312 --> 53:36.973
Told you this thing was tough.

53:37.047 --> 53:39.538
Hello! How are we
gonna salvage Julie?

53:40.650 --> 53:42.982
Did you guys already panty-raid
skater-boy Steve?

53:43.053 --> 53:46.250
Yeah, but Julie got nabbed
by Joe PatrolTec.

53:47.824 --> 53:49.485
She needs a hero.

53:54.598 --> 53:56.998
Your telephone number, please.

54:02.939 --> 54:03.928
Hey!

54:04.941 --> 54:07.637
No heels on the hardwood floor, okay?

54:17.554 --> 54:20.352
I don't know what girls
are always whining about.

54:20.423 --> 54:22.084
Heels aren't so bad.

54:26.329 --> 54:27.318
I'll get it!

54:30.166 --> 54:31.428
Yes, good evening.

54:31.501 --> 54:33.992
This is Officer Shiner
from PatrolTec Security.

54:34.070 --> 54:35.264
Is this Mr. Corky?

54:36.273 --> 54:40.209
Uh-huh. Well, I'm standing here
with your daughter Julie.

54:40.277 --> 54:41.335
That's right.

54:43.680 --> 54:44.840
All right.

54:44.914 --> 54:47.007
Your father
wants to talk to you.

54:58.662 --> 54:59.993
Dad?

55:00.063 --> 55:02.896
Fifty monthly for six months.

55:02.966 --> 55:05.298
Um, what was that, Dad?

55:05.368 --> 55:09.429
You have no idea how close Dad
just came to answering this phone.

55:09.506 --> 55:12.134
I had to hurt myself,

55:12.208 --> 55:14.073
and I'm wearing red pumps.

55:14.144 --> 55:16.578
Fifty monthly for six months.

55:16.646 --> 55:18.307
No.

55:18.381 --> 55:20.008
No?

55:20.083 --> 55:22.313
No. Three.

55:22.385 --> 55:24.250
You're negotiating row?

55:24.321 --> 55:26.585
That's right. I'll be home soon.

55:27.590 --> 55:28.716
That is...

55:33.296 --> 55:35.196
She renegotiated and hung up.

55:35.265 --> 55:38.860
She's way more impressive
than I thought.

55:41.271 --> 55:42.738
Don't move.

55:42.806 --> 55:46.708
I know I've got a field
interrogation card in here somewhere.

55:46.776 --> 55:48.266
Julie, get in!

55:48.345 --> 55:50.176
Hey! Tiny green car!

55:53.350 --> 55:56.842
- What are you doing?
- Winning!

55:56.920 --> 55:59.252
That's my official decal!

56:00.256 --> 56:02.952
We've got everything!
Let's get to the high school!

56:07.764 --> 56:10.028
That is it. Come on.

56:10.100 --> 56:11.897
What is the problem? Come on.

56:20.777 --> 56:24.042
Why do people
even have children? Why?

56:29.049 --> 56:31.984
Whoa! You are my hero!

56:32.052 --> 56:33.542
I'll write songs about you.

56:35.588 --> 56:36.577
Look!

56:37.891 --> 56:39.950
They stopped for juicers?

56:40.026 --> 56:41.721
- They're still in the game?
- Let's go!

56:51.004 --> 56:52.369
Come on! Go faster!

57:04.918 --> 57:05.907
Tie!

57:05.985 --> 57:08.419
Calm your jets.
Let's compare goods first.

57:12.859 --> 57:16.556
So, all things being equal,
tiebreaker.

57:16.629 --> 57:19.564
What? No, we share the spot.

57:19.632 --> 57:22.066
Share? With you?
Don't think so.

57:22.135 --> 57:23.932
Tiebreaker, winner take all.

57:24.003 --> 57:25.334
You're on.

57:25.405 --> 57:29.171
First one to get the king
or queen's crown at the dance, wins.

57:29.242 --> 57:30.334
What?

57:30.410 --> 57:32.878
Staci, isn't that Todd's car?

57:32.946 --> 57:34.709
That is his car.

57:34.781 --> 57:40.151
I thought you guys decided
you were skipping the dance, Staci.

57:47.393 --> 57:49.884
Are we really going into the dance?

57:50.964 --> 57:52.864
You bet we are. Follow.

58:13.987 --> 58:15.852
Tickets, please.

58:15.922 --> 58:18.857
Hold on. Where's your ticket?

58:18.925 --> 58:20.790
Oh, I...

58:23.029 --> 58:24.223
...don't have one.

58:24.297 --> 58:27.528
Sorry. No ticket, no dance.

58:29.602 --> 58:32.036
I know who you are.

58:34.541 --> 58:35.803
You do?

58:35.875 --> 58:40.209
You're out here collecting tickets
instead of being inside at the dance.

58:40.280 --> 58:43.613
You spend your weekends
doing extra-credit algebra,

58:43.683 --> 58:47.016
you play way too much
Monopoly with your parents,

58:47.086 --> 58:51.079
and you've never eaten
anywhere near the fountain.

58:51.157 --> 58:56.561
And in four years, I will be you
unless I get into that dance.

59:04.404 --> 59:05.769
You go.

59:05.838 --> 59:08.898
Get in there.
Do it for all those who never could.

59:08.975 --> 59:12.035
- Did we win?
- Almost. We still have to get the crown.

59:13.947 --> 59:16.006
Get... crown.

59:17.917 --> 59:19.441
What crown?

59:34.033 --> 59:37.560
So this is it...
a high school dance.

59:37.637 --> 59:40.470
They don't even let us
wear shoes at our dances.

59:40.540 --> 59:42.440
And they serve warm Kool-Aid.

59:42.508 --> 59:45.068
I wonder if Steve's here.

59:48.047 --> 59:51.380
Hey, spazmonkey, stand still.

59:51.451 --> 59:53.043
Let's scope.

59:57.190 --> 59:59.317
Where is Todd?
Do you see him?

59:59.392 --> 01:00:02.259
Not yet. Remain calm
until the evidence is in.

01:00:08.501 --> 01:00:11.061
Are you gonna ask someone to dance?
Come on, ask someone to dance.

01:00:11.137 --> 01:00:13.230
No, man, just leave me alone.

01:00:13.306 --> 01:00:14.796
Dude.

01:00:16.209 --> 01:00:17.836
You guys remember a girl
named Julie Corky?

01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:20.902
Wasn't she on our grade school bus?

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:23.540
Yes. I knew that was her.

01:00:24.584 --> 01:00:26.677
Gregg and I saw her
boarding tonight in a red dress.

01:00:27.754 --> 01:00:29.085
She looked sweet.

01:00:29.155 --> 01:00:30.247
Nice one.

01:00:30.323 --> 01:00:32.587
Hi. Hey.

01:00:32.659 --> 01:00:35.890
Hi. Do you...

01:00:36.963 --> 01:00:39.488
...know if your friend wants to dance?

01:00:41.067 --> 01:00:42.557
I don't know. Ask him.

01:00:42.635 --> 01:00:44.535
Could you ask him for me?

01:00:47.674 --> 01:00:52.407
Dude, that girl,
my dream girl, dance with her.

01:00:56.349 --> 01:00:57.338
Sure.

01:01:08.428 --> 01:01:10.419
Maybe they just met.

01:01:11.397 --> 01:01:13.661
Yeah. Maybe.

01:01:13.733 --> 01:01:15.564
Almost time for
the big dance contest,

01:01:15.635 --> 01:01:17.762
and remember, anything goes,

01:01:17.837 --> 01:01:20.431
so just pretend
that Mrs. Withers and I aren't here.

01:01:21.441 --> 01:01:23.909
Badness. Look over there!

01:01:26.279 --> 01:01:27.268
Come on!

01:01:40.026 --> 01:01:42.221
Guess you changed your mind
about the dance.

01:01:42.295 --> 01:01:43.353
Staci.

01:01:47.033 --> 01:01:48.557
Who the hell are you?

01:01:48.634 --> 01:01:50.727
- I'm his girlfriend.
- Oh, really?

01:01:50.803 --> 01:01:54.330
Because I'm his girlfriend.
Have been for six months.

01:01:57.944 --> 01:02:00.378
Catfight! Meow!

01:02:16.162 --> 01:02:19.529
Stay away from my footballer.

01:02:19.599 --> 01:02:20.964
You can have him!

01:02:23.302 --> 01:02:25.293
Hey, where you going?

01:02:25.371 --> 01:02:27.635
Get real. She's not worth it.

01:02:27.707 --> 01:02:29.197
Are you kidding?

01:02:29.275 --> 01:02:32.608
Staci? Staci's a prime goddess.

01:02:32.678 --> 01:02:35.875
If I had a girl like Staci,
I would worship her.

01:02:35.948 --> 01:02:38.508
She hooked up with you,
and now you dump her?

01:02:38.584 --> 01:02:40.711
What a typical quarterback move.

01:02:40.787 --> 01:02:45.554
Princess doesn't hook up.
Never has, never will.

01:02:47.727 --> 01:02:49.024
I...

01:02:49.095 --> 01:02:51.791
Looks like someone
isn't so different from us after all.

01:02:52.799 --> 01:02:54.061
All right, everybody grab a partner.

01:02:54.133 --> 01:02:57.000
The mojo dance contest
is about to begin.

01:02:57.069 --> 01:02:59.867
Come on, Todd. Let's go
command the dance contest.

01:03:01.441 --> 01:03:04.774
Too bad. So sad.

01:03:04.844 --> 01:03:07.210
Guess you don't have
anyone to enter with.

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.838
Yes I do.

01:03:09.916 --> 01:03:11.406
You've got to be kidding.

01:03:11.484 --> 01:03:14.453
Staci, did the fall
give you brain damage?

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:17.978
Bite me! I can dance!

01:03:22.595 --> 01:03:24.222
What do you say, girlfriends?

01:03:24.297 --> 01:03:25.992
But we don't have
anyone to dance with.

01:03:26.065 --> 01:03:28.295
Who else do we need?
Let's go!

01:04:31.330 --> 01:04:33.958
Freshman year, we have arrived!

01:04:40.139 --> 01:04:41.572
What is it?

01:04:41.641 --> 01:04:43.302
Some sort of list.

01:04:43.376 --> 01:04:45.571
"PatrolTec decal.

01:04:45.645 --> 01:04:47.078
"This one's for Julie...

01:04:47.146 --> 01:04:49.637
Get Steve Phillips' boxer shorts."

01:04:49.715 --> 01:04:52.183
That's where my boxers went!

01:04:52.251 --> 01:04:53.741
"Get crown."

01:04:53.819 --> 01:04:56.686
Dude, look,
it's the girl in the red dress!

01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:50.300
There's clearly
one shining couple here tonight,

01:05:50.376 --> 01:05:53.345
and here they are, the winners
of the mojo dance contest!

01:05:55.414 --> 01:05:56.574
Whatever.

01:05:56.649 --> 01:05:58.879
Well, you aren't a very good dancer.

01:05:58.951 --> 01:05:59.940
What?

01:06:09.695 --> 01:06:10.684
Thanks.

01:06:12.698 --> 01:06:16.065
Hey, you want to see
a picture of me in a coma?

01:06:17.303 --> 01:06:19.100
Okay.

01:06:19.171 --> 01:06:20.604
Really?

01:06:25.778 --> 01:06:27.405
Sweet.

01:06:29.982 --> 01:06:34.385
You know, this doesn't mean that we're,
like, boyfriend and girlfriend or anything.

01:06:34.453 --> 01:06:36.717
Oh, I know,
but now I've got this picture,

01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:40.748
and this picture is way better
than my coma picture.

01:06:40.826 --> 01:06:44.887
Dude, you are an insta-legend.

01:06:45.898 --> 01:06:47.627
Could we have our picture
taken with you?

01:06:50.069 --> 01:06:51.058
Be cool, guys.

01:06:56.308 --> 01:06:58.572
This is the sweetest slumber party ever.

01:06:58.644 --> 01:07:00.874
Yeah. Aren't you glad
Staci couldn't come?

01:07:00.946 --> 01:07:01.935
What? Why?

01:07:02.014 --> 01:07:05.074
Because Julie's mom only let her
invite three girls.

01:07:07.086 --> 01:07:08.986
I...

01:07:09.055 --> 01:07:11.080
was the replacement?

01:07:11.157 --> 01:07:14.024
I mean... no.

01:07:14.093 --> 01:07:16.323
I was the replacement.

01:07:18.264 --> 01:07:19.595
What did you say to her?

01:07:19.665 --> 01:07:23.101
- I didn't mean to. It just...
- What?

01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:27.367
I told her that she
replaced Staci at the party.

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:28.805
Oh, no.

01:07:28.874 --> 01:07:30.501
I'm sorry.

01:07:30.576 --> 01:07:33.136
Let's go find her. Come on.

01:07:35.448 --> 01:07:37.177
Before Mr. Chilton announces
the king and queen,

01:07:37.249 --> 01:07:39.183
we have a special dedication,

01:07:39.251 --> 01:07:40.912
to Yancy

01:07:40.986 --> 01:07:42.886
from the speaker-moving guy.

01:08:11.117 --> 01:08:12.812
What are you doing here?

01:08:12.885 --> 01:08:14.512
I told you I had another gig.

01:08:14.587 --> 01:08:16.020
I saw you dancing out there.

01:08:16.087 --> 01:08:18.886
I thought you might want to
try with a partner.

01:08:19.457 --> 01:08:20.447
Yes.

01:08:28.466 --> 01:08:31.027
Someone for everyone...

01:08:31.103 --> 01:08:33.002
except me.

01:08:34.006 --> 01:08:38.500
On the bright yet dim side,
we could still win the scavenger hunt.

01:08:38.577 --> 01:08:39.566
True.

01:08:39.645 --> 01:08:41.670
Where do you think
they keep those crowns?

01:08:42.747 --> 01:08:44.305
Come on.

01:08:45.384 --> 01:08:47.852
- Do you like brownies?
- Are you kidding?

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:50.752
Brownies are
a very important food group.

01:08:55.294 --> 01:08:56.658
The crowns aren't here.

01:08:56.729 --> 01:08:58.526
So you haven't won.

01:08:58.596 --> 01:08:59.586
Yet.

01:08:59.665 --> 01:09:03.157
We're not giving the fountain spot
to you Dumpster frumpsters.

01:09:03.234 --> 01:09:05.328
Talk, talk, talk, and no action.

01:09:08.506 --> 01:09:11.100
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

01:09:11.176 --> 01:09:13.645
You've been voting all week
for king and queen.

01:09:14.647 --> 01:09:17.946
Jennifer Allen and Steve Phillips.

01:09:19.018 --> 01:09:20.109
He won?

01:09:20.185 --> 01:09:21.881
Steve won!

01:09:24.523 --> 01:09:27.356
Jennifer's a bud of mine,
a former cheer squad leader.

01:09:27.426 --> 01:09:28.916
She'll give me the crown for sure.

01:09:33.532 --> 01:09:35.090
Choose your partners, guys.

01:09:35.167 --> 01:09:36.862
This song's reserved for you.

01:09:45.810 --> 01:09:50.372
Julie? Julie Corky?

01:09:55.754 --> 01:09:57.619
He just said your name!

01:09:58.691 --> 01:09:59.953
That was real?

01:10:00.025 --> 01:10:01.253
Yes!

01:10:13.072 --> 01:10:14.562
Wanna dance?

01:10:29.488 --> 01:10:32.321
I didn't even know you knew who I was.

01:10:43.702 --> 01:10:44.964
You win.

01:10:47.439 --> 01:10:49.703
- Julie got the crown!
- We win!

01:10:49.775 --> 01:10:51.675
We win the scavenger hunt!

01:10:51.744 --> 01:10:53.712
I knew it! I knew it!
I knew it!

01:10:53.779 --> 01:10:55.713
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?

01:10:55.781 --> 01:10:58.375
You were so sure we'd win,
you gave away our spot.

01:10:58.450 --> 01:11:00.816
Let us know
how the Dumpster tables are.

01:11:00.886 --> 01:11:03.980
- I hear they have gum on them.
- And other unmentionables.

01:11:04.056 --> 01:11:05.489
Unmentionables?

01:11:05.557 --> 01:11:07.957
I cannot eat on unmentionables.

01:11:31.216 --> 01:11:32.911
How did you know?

01:11:32.985 --> 01:11:34.475
Know?

01:11:35.554 --> 01:11:38.580
About me and you...
and the crown?

01:11:38.657 --> 01:11:40.921
I saw you boarding earlier tonight.

01:11:40.993 --> 01:11:43.757
And then I saw you out there dancing.

01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:45.819
It all fit.

01:11:46.899 --> 01:11:48.025
And the crown...

01:11:48.934 --> 01:11:51.664
By the way,
can I have my boxers back?

01:11:53.672 --> 01:11:55.435
I like your laugh.

01:12:04.283 --> 01:12:07.616
- I'm sorry. It might be...
- Go ahead.

01:12:10.756 --> 01:12:13.247
- Hello?
- Where are you guys?

01:12:13.325 --> 01:12:15.293
- Is Mom home?
- Well, no, but she...

01:12:15.361 --> 01:12:17.420
<i>hf Dad only krew where Mom
really was tonight...</i>

01:12:17.496 --> 01:12:22.058
<i>Julie. she just called.
She's or her way. So get home. Now.</i>

01:12:23.135 --> 01:12:25.035
Who was it? Was it your mom?

01:12:26.338 --> 01:12:29.705
My mom doesn't know we left the house,
and she's on her way home right now.

01:12:29.775 --> 01:12:32.573
What? She's on her way home?
Let's go!

01:12:32.644 --> 01:12:34.805
Unbelievable as it is, I have to go.

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.370
I'm sorry.

01:12:42.688 --> 01:12:43.677
All right.

01:12:44.690 --> 01:12:45.952
Good time.

01:12:48.694 --> 01:12:50.127
I didn't get the kiss.

01:12:50.195 --> 01:12:51.184
What?

01:12:52.197 --> 01:12:53.960
He's gonna wake up tomorrow

01:12:54.033 --> 01:12:56.729
and realize that I'm just
some average little freshman.

01:12:56.802 --> 01:12:59.168
I had my chance, and I missed it.

01:13:01.173 --> 01:13:02.401
Whoo! Crank it!

01:13:02.474 --> 01:13:03.463
Whoo!

01:13:03.542 --> 01:13:04.531
Yeah!

01:13:05.544 --> 01:13:08.012
We should do this once a week.

01:13:10.682 --> 01:13:11.671
My crown!

01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:14.514
Hey, tiny green car!

01:13:19.558 --> 01:13:20.991
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:23.722
I am commandeering this car
in the name of PatrolTec Security.

01:13:23.796 --> 01:13:26.993
Please evacuate... hey! Hey!
I am a security officer!

01:13:27.066 --> 01:13:28.590
I took a two-week course!

01:13:36.508 --> 01:13:39.909
Hi, Mom, could you pick me up?
I'm on the corner of Union and Grant.

01:13:39.978 --> 01:13:42.242
L-I really don't want to talk about it.

01:13:51.190 --> 01:13:52.487
What are we gonna do?

01:13:54.593 --> 01:13:55.787
Come on!

01:13:57.796 --> 01:13:59.195
The fort!

01:13:59.264 --> 01:14:01.323
- What?
- Trust me.

01:14:14.313 --> 01:14:16.304
Come on! Come on!

01:14:16.381 --> 01:14:17.370
Get up.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:22.709
Catch it!

01:14:31.463 --> 01:14:33.158
Julie, what are you doing?

01:14:33.232 --> 01:14:35.359
- Julie, no.
- You're gonna fall!

01:14:35.434 --> 01:14:37.425
- Julie!
- She's gonna fall!

01:14:46.512 --> 01:14:47.740
Oh, my God!

01:14:49.648 --> 01:14:51.206
You guys, help!

01:14:59.358 --> 01:15:00.916
Julie, are you okay?

01:15:00.993 --> 01:15:02.358
What about you?

01:15:03.428 --> 01:15:04.918
Just go.

01:15:04.997 --> 01:15:07.591
Hey, come on, let's go.

01:15:09.368 --> 01:15:11.233
Take care. Thanks for driving.

01:15:11.303 --> 01:15:14.864
- I'll see you later.
- Bye, girls.

01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:17.500
- You forgot your scarf.
- Thank you.

01:15:31.657 --> 01:15:32.681
Hi.

01:15:32.858 --> 01:15:34.348
Hi.

01:15:34.426 --> 01:15:36.917
So, how was the party?

01:15:36.995 --> 01:15:38.326
Quiet.

01:15:39.398 --> 01:15:40.490
Quiet?

01:15:43.168 --> 01:15:45.898
Wait. I want to
show you something. Come here.

01:15:48.974 --> 01:15:52.432
This is our old water. Have a taste.

01:15:54.846 --> 01:15:56.609
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:15:56.682 --> 01:15:59.242
Now try our brand-new water.

01:16:05.524 --> 01:16:06.786
Honey...

01:16:07.859 --> 01:16:09.986
this definitely tastes better.

01:16:10.062 --> 01:16:12.530
- Oh, gosh.
- Thank you.

01:16:14.032 --> 01:16:17.490
- Did you have fun at the club?
- I did, but I missed you.

01:16:17.569 --> 01:16:19.764
Everybody needs
a night out now and then.

01:16:19.838 --> 01:16:21.863
You know what? They do.

01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:23.601
Let's go check on the girls.

01:16:23.675 --> 01:16:24.664
Okay.

01:16:26.445 --> 01:16:28.140
Assume sleep positions!

01:16:59.411 --> 01:17:01.902
Told ya. No problem.

01:17:06.985 --> 01:17:09.317
- What's with him?
- I don't know.

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:16.855
We really did it.

01:17:17.929 --> 01:17:22.195
My Cinderella night,
and I'm still the ugly stepsister.

01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:33.569
Ladies, time to get up.

01:17:33.645 --> 01:17:35.670
There's gonna be pancakes!

01:17:39.384 --> 01:17:41.352
How long were we asleep?

01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:42.580
Ten minutes.

01:17:43.655 --> 01:17:45.748
Funny. Feels like five.

01:17:49.828 --> 01:17:52.661
You know, I always knew
that old fort would come down one day.

01:17:52.731 --> 01:17:54.961
I just didn't think it would
take the arbor down with it.

01:17:55.934 --> 01:17:58.425
Hey, this water's not so bad, Dad.

01:17:58.503 --> 01:17:59.936
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:18:00.005 --> 01:18:00.994
Well, thank you.

01:18:02.007 --> 01:18:03.907
What are we gonna do
about the backyard?

01:18:04.976 --> 01:18:07.672
You might be on your own there, Dad.

01:18:07.746 --> 01:18:10.374
I've decided to go back to college.

01:18:12.651 --> 01:18:14.016
That's great.

01:18:14.086 --> 01:18:16.111
Yeah, I mean, last night
kinda got me to thinking,

01:18:16.188 --> 01:18:17.849
you know, high school rocked,

01:18:17.923 --> 01:18:21.051
but it's time to leave it to sis.

01:18:21.126 --> 01:18:24.152
I think I may have
a career ahead in surveillance.

01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:26.663
I hear PatrolTec has an opening.

01:18:29.868 --> 01:18:31.335
So...

01:18:33.171 --> 01:18:36.607
exactly what
did you girls do last night?

01:18:37.175 --> 01:18:38.574
Exactly?

01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:42.972
Exactly.

01:18:46.685 --> 01:18:48.152
Here's the thing, Mom.

01:18:50.222 --> 01:18:51.553
The thing is...

01:18:53.892 --> 01:18:56.258
We left the house,

01:18:56.328 --> 01:19:01.129
but I assure you, it was for
a very important adolescent cause.

01:19:01.199 --> 01:19:02.359
Adolescent?

01:19:04.403 --> 01:19:06.462
As in "growing up"?

01:19:06.538 --> 01:19:08.870
Is that so hard to believe?

01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:10.464
Yes, it is,

01:19:10.542 --> 01:19:15.343
because not too long ago
I had a little girl who took ballet.

01:19:15.414 --> 01:19:17.473
She did magic tricks.

01:19:17.549 --> 01:19:21.144
We used to bake together
in her Easy-Bake oven,

01:19:21.219 --> 01:19:24.552
and she loved ponies and ladybugs.

01:19:26.792 --> 01:19:28.453
I remember her.

01:19:28.527 --> 01:19:32.395
I guess I missed the bridge
between ladybugs and boys.

01:19:33.965 --> 01:19:36.058
I think I'm still standing on that bridge.

01:19:41.072 --> 01:19:43.540
You take your time crossing it.

01:19:43.608 --> 01:19:45.200
Got you something.

01:19:52.484 --> 01:19:54.315
A doorknob?

01:19:54.386 --> 01:19:56.183
With a lock.

01:19:59.591 --> 01:20:02.253
<i>To the unstoppable freshmer.</i>

01:20:02.327 --> 01:20:04.022
Unstoppable!

01:20:08.633 --> 01:20:11.363
- That's my mom.
- She's giving me a ride.

01:20:12.370 --> 01:20:14.361
I have to get home
and finish packing.

01:20:17.309 --> 01:20:19.607
- Bye!
- Bye!

01:20:19.678 --> 01:20:21.077
Bye!

01:20:21.146 --> 01:20:23.444
- I had a fun time!
- Thank you!

01:20:32.691 --> 01:20:36.218
So... this is it.

01:20:37.362 --> 01:20:39.592
You're really moving.

01:20:42.367 --> 01:20:44.232
Everything changes now.

01:20:44.302 --> 01:20:46.532
Everything would have changed anyway.

01:20:47.873 --> 01:20:49.864
Last night did that.

01:20:51.943 --> 01:20:54.468
Tell me how the view is
from the lunch spot.

01:20:55.547 --> 01:20:57.572
If we sit there.

01:20:57.649 --> 01:20:58.741
What do you mean?

01:20:58.817 --> 01:21:02.617
Wherever we sit,
that'll be the lunch spot.

01:21:05.624 --> 01:21:07.489
You're ready for high school.

01:21:11.963 --> 01:21:13.225
I blame you.

01:21:22.641 --> 01:21:24.472
Take care of the girls.

01:21:32.817 --> 01:21:34.341
Don't forget.

01:21:41.092 --> 01:21:42.559
Never.

01:22:53.231 --> 01:22:54.721
I think this is yours.

01:23:11.216 --> 01:23:13.446
<i>Ard so it happened...</i>

01:23:13.518 --> 01:23:16.976
<i>the girl ir the lopsided crowr
got her kiss.</i>

01:23:17.055 --> 01:23:19.148
<i>Naturally. H told Harrah all about it.</i>

01:23:19.224 --> 01:23:21.317
<i>H try to keep her up-to- date
with high school</i>.

01:23:21.393 --> 01:23:23.588
<i>Which is going surprisinly well...</i>

01:23:23.662 --> 01:23:24.822
<i>for us.</i>

01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:27.297
<i>As for Staci an Liz...</i>

01:23:27.365 --> 01:23:29.299
<i>well. A deal's a deal</i>
