WEBVTT

00:07.758 --> 00:09.549
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.550 --> 00:11.931
AND NOW YOU'VE SEEN IT.

00:11.932 --> 00:12.972
THAT'S A TATTOO?

00:12.973 --> 00:13.973
IT LOOKS LIKE A BIRTH MARK

00:13.974 --> 00:15.635
YOU COLORED IN.

00:15.636 --> 00:17.637
IT'S A SEXY LITTLE DEVIL.

00:17.638 --> 00:19.059
YOU KNOW, AN ENDEARING MEMENTO

00:19.060 --> 00:20.640
OF AN EARLIER TIME IN MY LIFE.

00:20.641 --> 00:22.643
WHAT I LIKE TO CALL
"THE TEQUILA YEARS."

00:23.814 --> 00:24.814
YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE LASERS.

00:24.815 --> 00:26.236
YOU CAN GET THAT REMOVED.

00:26.237 --> 00:27.817
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE THIS WAY.

00:27.818 --> 00:30.360
WELL, JOE CALLS IT MY LITTLE
PRE-EXISTING CONDITION.

00:30.361 --> 00:31.611
HE REALLY LIKES IT.

00:31.612 --> 00:33.783
YEAH, IT'S PROBABLY LIKE
A MILE MARKER FOR HIM.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.955
YOU KNOW, "I'M ALMOST THERE!"

00:35.956 --> 00:37.617
- ( door opens )
- HEY.

00:37.618 --> 00:39.789
SO, I'M LATE FOR A CLIENT.
WANT TO KNOW WHY?

00:39.790 --> 00:41.211
OH GOOD, I'LL TELL YOU.

00:41.212 --> 00:42.462
SO I'M PULLING OUT OF
THE PARKING LOT, RIGHT?

00:42.463 --> 00:43.963
AND THIS CRAZY WOMAN
RAMS INTO ME AND KNOCKS

00:43.964 --> 00:45.755
- THE BUMPER OFF MY CAR.
- ARE YOU OKAY?

00:45.756 --> 00:47.797
YEAH, I'M JUST PISSED OFF. SHE
DIDN'T EVEN APOLOGIZE OR ANYTHING.

00:47.798 --> 00:49.629
SHE FLIPPED ME OFF
AND DROVE AWAY.

00:49.630 --> 00:51.801
I LOOKED INTO HER EYES.
IT WAS PURE EVIL.

00:51.802 --> 00:54.974
LIKE STARING AT THE DEVIL.

00:54.975 --> 00:56.676
IT HAUNTS YOU, DOESN'T IT?

00:56.677 --> 00:58.638
IT REALLY DOES.
JOKE'S ON HER THOUGH,

00:58.639 --> 01:00.850
BECAUSE I TOOK A PICTURE
OF HER LICENSE PLATE,

01:00.851 --> 01:01.941
SO BUSTED!

01:01.942 --> 01:03.643
NOW WE'RE TALKING.
TEXT ME THAT PIC

01:03.644 --> 01:04.814
AND I'M GONNA GET SOME
OF MY POLICE CONTACTS

01:04.815 --> 01:06.065
TO TRACK DOWN THIS LUNATIC.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.318
SHE HIT YOU, SHE HIT ME.

01:08.319 --> 01:09.989
OH, BABY, YOU GOT MY BACK.

01:09.990 --> 01:12.072
OH, YEAH. OUR LOVE IS LIKE
ITS OWN LITTLE MAFIA.

01:13.194 --> 01:14.784
ALL RIGHT, WELL, THERE.
IT'S SENT.

01:14.785 --> 01:17.367
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE
TO HEAD BACK OUT TO THE GARAGE

01:17.368 --> 01:18.958
TO TRAIN MY CLIENT.
I GOT TWO WEEKS

01:18.959 --> 01:20.960
TO TURN THIS 300-POUND
DENTIST INTO A RIPPED ADONIS

01:20.961 --> 01:22.792
BEFORE HIS UKRAINIAN
BRIDE GETS HERE,

01:22.793 --> 01:26.086
SO, YOU KNOW, EVERY
SECOND COUNTS.

01:27.168 --> 01:28.548
I HATE RECKLESS DRIVERS.

01:28.549 --> 01:30.970
THEY ARE THE SCUM OF THE EARTH.
THEY ARE MY...

01:30.971 --> 01:32.342
HAIRDRESSER.

01:32.343 --> 01:34.634
- WHAT?
- YEAH, I KNOW THIS LICENSE PLATE.

01:34.635 --> 01:37.137
"I KUT 4 U." IT'S CALISTA.

01:37.138 --> 01:38.518
THE CALISTA?

01:38.519 --> 01:39.889
YES, THE MAGICAL CALISTA.

01:39.890 --> 01:41.891
THE BEST COLORIST A
WOMAN COULD ASK FOR.

01:41.892 --> 01:44.394
I LIST HER AS AN
EMERGENCY CONTACT.

01:44.395 --> 01:46.986
OH, MAN, IT'S TOO BAD YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO QUIT SEEING HER.

01:46.987 --> 01:48.938
HUH, YOU SAY?

01:48.939 --> 01:50.570
YOU ARE DROPPING HER, RIGHT?

01:50.571 --> 01:52.992
I MEAN YOU JUST TOLD JOE
"SHE HIT YOU, SHE HIT ME."

01:52.993 --> 01:54.113
( chuckles ) COME ON.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.826
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
SOMETHING I'D SAY.

01:56.827 --> 01:58.288
( theme music playing )

01:58.289 --> 02:00.580
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE ♪

02:00.581 --> 02:02.373
♪ STUCK WITH ME ♪

02:05.876 --> 02:08.628
AUNT MEL, YOUR HAIRDRESSER
HIT JOE'S CAR AND DROVE OFF.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.590
YOU CAN'T GO BACK TO
CALISTA AFTER THIS.

02:10.591 --> 02:14.424
YOU HAVEN'T HAD THE AWFUL
HAIR EXPERIENCES I'VE HAD.

02:14.425 --> 02:16.306
YOU SAY THAT LIKE YOU'VE
BEEN TRAUMATIZED.

02:16.307 --> 02:17.807
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE,

02:17.808 --> 02:20.560
SLINKING FROM ONE
HAIRDRESSER TO THE NEXT.

02:20.561 --> 02:22.812
JUST LONELY, DIRTY, DESPERATE,

02:22.813 --> 02:25.064
AND THEN YOU FIND CALISTA,

02:25.065 --> 02:27.897
AND SHE TAKES YOUR
HAIR IN HER HANDS,

02:27.898 --> 02:30.731
AND SUDDENLY YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

02:32.983 --> 02:34.194
BESIDES, IT'S NOT LIKE
SHE KILLED ANYBODY.

02:34.195 --> 02:35.825
NOT A MURDERER?

02:35.826 --> 02:38.198
REALLY, THAT'S
WHERE YOUR BAR IS?

02:38.199 --> 02:39.779
CALISTA IS AN ARTIST.

02:39.780 --> 02:41.781
AND ARTISTS DON'T HAVE TO
LIVE BY OUR LITTLE RULES.

02:41.782 --> 02:43.042
SHE DESERVES MY LOYALTY.

02:43.043 --> 02:45.455
OH, SO YOU HAVE HEARD
OF THE CONCEPT.

02:45.456 --> 02:46.786
YOUR LOYALTY SHOULD BE WITH JOE.

02:46.787 --> 02:48.378
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

02:48.379 --> 02:50.590
BUT LET ME HANDLE
THIS IN MY OWN WAY.

02:50.591 --> 02:52.502
- STUPID JOE.
- EXCUSE ME?

02:52.503 --> 02:55.215
STUPID JOE STALIN.

02:55.216 --> 02:57.387
WHAT HE DID TO THOSE PEASANTS?

02:57.388 --> 02:59.220
YEAH, LOOK IT UP.

03:00.391 --> 03:02.012
( school bell rings )

03:04.895 --> 03:06.105
Mr. McKay: ALL RIGHT.

03:06.106 --> 03:08.898
SINCE I DIDN'T MEET A
SUGAR MAMA THIS WEEKEND,

03:08.899 --> 03:11.231
I'M STILL TEACHING. ( chuckles )

03:11.232 --> 03:13.983
AND WE'RE STARTING A NEW UNIT.

03:13.984 --> 03:16.156
- "ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION"
- ( door closes )

03:18.198 --> 03:19.869
SOMETHING MANY OF YOU
WILL LEARN TO LIVE WITH

03:19.870 --> 03:21.821
IN YOUR STUDIO APARTMENTS
AFTER COLLEGE.

03:21.822 --> 03:24.123
HEY, STELLA, CAN WE
TALK FOR A MINUTE?

03:24.124 --> 03:26.286
UH, ARE YOU IN MY CLASS?

03:26.287 --> 03:27.917
JUST... JUST FOR A MINUTE.

03:27.918 --> 03:30.500
RYDER, I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.
WE BROKE UP.

03:30.501 --> 03:31.921
WE DIDN'T HAVE TO, OKAY?

03:31.922 --> 03:34.093
IT WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING,
WHICH I WILL EXPLAIN.

03:34.094 --> 03:35.965
YOU KNOW, THIS IS MY DREAM...

03:35.966 --> 03:37.797
MOODY TEENS WORKING OUT
THEIR PERSONAL PROBLEMS

03:37.798 --> 03:38.888
ON MY TIME.

03:38.889 --> 03:40.930
GET OUT.

03:40.931 --> 03:42.932
OUT OUT OUT OUT OUT.

03:42.933 --> 03:44.054
OKAY.

03:46.807 --> 03:47.937
NOW THEN,

03:47.938 --> 03:51.312
BACK TO THE POETRY OF THE
LONELY LOVELESS SPORE.

04:02.783 --> 04:04.574
HONEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:04.575 --> 04:06.326
I CAN'T FIND THE DAMN CORKSCREW.

04:06.327 --> 04:10.670
THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU LEFT
IT IN THE BATHROOM.

04:10.671 --> 04:14.133
YEAH, THAT'S THE
BATHROOM CORKSCREW.

04:14.134 --> 04:16.546
NATURALLY.

04:16.547 --> 04:18.298
HEY, WHAT DID THOSE
POLICE CONTACTS SAY

04:18.299 --> 04:19.879
ABOUT THAT CRAZY WOMAN
WHO SMASHED INTO MY CAR?

04:19.880 --> 04:22.221
OH, FUNNY COINCIDENCE.

04:22.222 --> 04:24.644
YOU'RE GONNA LAUGH.

04:24.645 --> 04:28.017
TURNS OUT THE WOMAN WHO
TAPPED YOUR BUMPER...

04:28.018 --> 04:30.980
YEAH, TAPPED, DEMOLISHED.

04:30.981 --> 04:34.814
...IS MY GENTLE DARLING OF AN
ANGEL HAIRDRESSER CALISTA.

04:34.815 --> 04:36.526
"GENTLE ANGEL"?

04:36.527 --> 04:39.198
HONEY, SHE SMASHED INTO MY CAR
AND THEN GAVE ME THE FINGER.

04:39.199 --> 04:40.610
( laughs )

04:40.611 --> 04:42.902
CLASSIC CALISTA.

04:42.903 --> 04:44.994
OH, COME ON. WHAT PART OF
THAT IS NOT HILARIOUS?

04:44.995 --> 04:46.786
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU'RE GONNA
DEFEND THIS HIT-AND-RUN FELON.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.788
YOU KNOW, I DID A
LITTLE RESEARCH ONLINE.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.210
IT'S GONNA COST $800 TO
REPLACE THAT BUMPER.

04:51.211 --> 04:53.212
SO I GUESS I'LL JUST BE TURNING
EVERYTHING OVER TO THE POLICE

04:53.213 --> 04:54.794
- AND MY INSURANCE COMPANY.
- NO NO NO NO NO NO.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.215
TURN IT OVER TO ME.

04:56.216 --> 04:57.627
YEAH, I'LL TALK TO
CALISTA AND CONVINCE HER

04:57.628 --> 04:59.008
TO PAY YOU WHAT SHE OWES YOU.

04:59.009 --> 05:00.800
I DON'T KNOW.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.632
COME ON, LET ME TRY.

05:02.633 --> 05:04.595
I'LL MAKE THE LITTLE
DEVIL DANCE FOR YOU.

05:07.688 --> 05:09.139
YOU GOT 24 HOURS.

05:11.271 --> 05:14.394
HEY, CAN YOU HELP ME
WITH SOME GIRL STUFF?

05:14.395 --> 05:16.776
YOU MEAN GIRL STUFF
OR GIRL STUFF?

05:16.777 --> 05:18.438
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

05:18.439 --> 05:20.700
WELL, ONE KIND OF STUFF IS:
"EW, ASK GOOGLE HEALTH,

05:20.701 --> 05:22.071
YOU FREAK."

05:22.072 --> 05:25.655
AND THE OTHER KIND IS" "I'M
A CHICK, WHAT'S THE DRAMA?"

05:25.656 --> 05:28.037
OKAY, SO I REALLY WANT
TO GET STELLA BACK,

05:28.038 --> 05:30.910
AND I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS
APOLOGY TEXT ALL MORNING.

05:30.911 --> 05:32.211
GET STELLA BACK?

05:32.212 --> 05:33.793
DUDE, YOU SLEPT WITH HER

05:33.794 --> 05:34.954
AND THEN SHE READ
THE BREAK-UP NOTE

05:34.955 --> 05:36.166
YOU WERE PLANNING ON GIVING HER.

05:37.167 --> 05:38.337
IT AIN'T HAPPENING.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.629
HOLD ON.

05:39.630 --> 05:42.221
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO
APOLOGIZE FOR A WEEK,

05:42.222 --> 05:43.803
BUT SHE AVOIDS ME AT SCHOOL,

05:43.804 --> 05:45.465
SHE WON'T ANSWER HER PHONE,

05:45.466 --> 05:47.226
SO CAN YOU JUST
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS

05:47.227 --> 05:49.639
AND TELL ME IF IT'S
HEARTFELT ENOUGH?

05:49.640 --> 05:51.230
YEAH.

05:51.231 --> 05:52.472
"HEY, STEL.

05:52.473 --> 05:55.935
W-N-T-T-A-T"?

05:55.936 --> 05:58.067
"WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS."

05:58.068 --> 06:01.861
YOU LADY KILLER, YOU.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.653
WAIT, SO IT... SO IT'S GOOD?

06:03.654 --> 06:05.364
NO.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.617
COME ON, RYDER. STELLA
WAS REALLY HURT.

06:07.618 --> 06:08.788
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT
TO GET HER BACK,

06:08.789 --> 06:10.119
YOU NEED TO GO BIG.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.951
YOU NEED TO DO
SOMETHING IMPRESSIVE

06:11.952 --> 06:14.794
AND GRAND AND ROMANTIC.

06:14.795 --> 06:16.205
OKAY, ALL RIGHT. YEAH.

06:16.206 --> 06:18.297
SO LIKE BUY HER A
ZOO MEMBERSHIP?

06:18.298 --> 06:20.339
WHAT? NO.

06:20.340 --> 06:22.762
BUT THEY JUST GOT A MANATEE.

06:22.763 --> 06:23.923
YOU'RE HOPELESS.

06:23.924 --> 06:26.506
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
A ROMANTIC COMEDY?

06:26.507 --> 06:27.637
YEAH.

06:27.638 --> 06:29.969
I MEAN, NOT ALL THE WAY THROUGH.

06:29.970 --> 06:30.811
ALL RIGHT. WELL, WATCH A FEW.

06:30.812 --> 06:32.472
AND HANG IN THERE UNTIL THE END,

06:32.473 --> 06:33.973
'CAUSE THAT'S WHEN THE GUY
FIGURES OUT WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO.

06:33.974 --> 06:36.315
JUST DO THAT. IF STELLA'S
WORTH IT TO YOU.

06:36.316 --> 06:37.977
SHE IS SO WORTH IT.

06:37.978 --> 06:40.860
I WOULD SIT THROUGH FIVE
DREW BARRYMORE MOVIES.

06:40.861 --> 06:43.784
START WITH ONE, OKAY? YOU
DON'T WANT TO PULL ANYTHING.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.618
- JOE, GREAT.
- YEAH?

06:48.619 --> 06:50.620
THIS IS FOR YOU.

06:50.621 --> 06:52.201
WHAT IS THIS?

06:52.202 --> 06:53.994
CASH?

06:55.626 --> 06:56.797
$400.

06:59.209 --> 07:00.920
FOR LAST NIGHT, HUH?

07:00.921 --> 07:02.301
VERY FUNNY.

07:02.302 --> 07:04.133
I TALKED TO CALISTA ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED WITH YOUR CAR,

07:04.134 --> 07:05.885
AND SHE ADMITTED SHE
HANDLED IT POORLY.

07:05.886 --> 07:08.177
POORLY, CRIMINALLY.

07:08.178 --> 07:09.809
WELL, WHEN SHE
BARELY TAPPED YOU,

07:09.810 --> 07:11.551
SHE HAD JUST GOTTEN A
CALL FROM THE PARAMEDICS

07:11.552 --> 07:13.262
THAT HER MOTHER WAS BEING
TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL

07:13.263 --> 07:14.393
AND SHE WAS UPSET.

07:14.394 --> 07:15.765
YOU KNOW, VERY UPSET.

07:15.766 --> 07:17.396
OH MY GOSH. IS HER
MOM GONNA BE OKAY?

07:17.397 --> 07:18.978
YEAH, IT WAS JUST INDIGESTION,

07:18.979 --> 07:20.770
BUT IT TURNS OUT HER MOM'S
LIKE A BIG DRAMA QUEEN.

07:20.771 --> 07:22.401
"LOOK AT ME. I'M
IN AN AMBULANCE."

07:22.402 --> 07:24.774
ANYWAY, I TOLD HER HOW
MUCH THE REPAIRS COST,

07:24.775 --> 07:26.776
AND SHE WAS VERY SORRY.
THAT'S THE FIRST HALF,

07:26.777 --> 07:27.827
SHE'LL GET YOU THE
REST NEXT WEEK.

07:27.828 --> 07:29.448
HUH.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.870
I DIDN'T THINK THAT
CALISTA WOULD STEP UP

07:30.871 --> 07:32.201
AND DO THE RIGHT THING.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.573
I GUESS I MISJUDGED HER.

07:33.574 --> 07:36.166
I GUESS YOU DID.
LESSON LEARNED, HUH?

07:37.457 --> 07:39.789
AND THE LESSON IS
MEL ALWAYS WINS.

07:39.790 --> 07:41.671
HEY, THAT'S MY PURSE.

07:41.672 --> 07:43.673
OH, RELAX, I'M STEALING
MONEY FOR TEXTBOOKS.

07:43.674 --> 07:44.964
IT COULD BE MUCH WORSE.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.797
WELL, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
FIND ANY CASH IN THERE.

07:47.798 --> 07:49.719
OH, WELL, THERE WAS CASH IN HERE

07:49.720 --> 07:50.800
NOT TOO LONG AGO.

07:50.801 --> 07:51.801
ACCORDING TO THIS ATM RECEIPT,

07:51.802 --> 07:54.143
YOU WITHDREW $400 AT
8:30 THIS MORNING.

07:54.144 --> 07:55.805
NEXT TIME, GET A WARRANT.

07:55.806 --> 07:57.647
THAT MONEY WAS FOR JOE.

07:57.648 --> 07:59.308
I TOLD HIM I SPOKE TO CALISTA

07:59.309 --> 08:00.810
AND WORKED OUT THE WHOLE
FENDER BENDER THING.

08:00.811 --> 08:02.441
AND THAT SHE'D PAY
HALF NOW, HALF LATER.

08:02.442 --> 08:03.863
HALF NOW.

08:03.864 --> 08:06.195
YOU PAID JOE OFF AND TOLD
HIM IT WAS CALISTA'S MONEY?

08:06.196 --> 08:07.276
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

08:07.277 --> 08:09.529
SHH. I CAN'T LOSE CALISTA NOW.

08:09.530 --> 08:11.030
OKAY? I'M GONNA SEE HER LATER.

08:11.031 --> 08:12.612
SHE'S GONNA BE DE-BRASSING
MY HIGHLIGHTS

08:12.613 --> 08:13.823
FOR THE MAYOR'S BANQUET.

08:13.824 --> 08:15.114
AUNT MEL, DON'T YOU THINK

08:15.115 --> 08:17.416
YOU'RE IN KIND OF A
MORALLY GRAY AREA HERE?

08:17.417 --> 08:20.790
AS LONG AS I CAN KEEP IT FROM
BECOMING A MORALLY GRAY AREA UP HERE,

08:20.791 --> 08:21.922
I'LL BE FINE.

08:30.801 --> 08:33.052
CALISTA, HI.

08:33.053 --> 08:34.894
I'M SORRY, ARE YOU A CLIENT?

08:34.895 --> 08:36.225
I'M A VICTIM.

08:36.226 --> 08:37.897
REMEMBER, YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT BACKED YOUR CAR

08:37.898 --> 08:39.478
- INTO ME THE OTHER DAY.
- THAT WAS YOU?

08:39.479 --> 08:41.310
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- WELL, I JUST WANTED TO COME HERE

08:41.311 --> 08:42.902
AND PERSONALLY THANK
YOU FOR WHAT YOU DID.

08:42.903 --> 08:44.774
WELL, YOU HAD IT COMING.

08:44.775 --> 08:46.776
I DID. I DID.

08:46.777 --> 08:49.649
- HEY, HOW'S YOUR MOM?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

08:49.650 --> 08:51.781
WELL, I KNOW SHE CAN BE A
BIT OF A HYPOCHONDRIAC.

08:51.782 --> 08:53.322
SHE LIKES TO COMPLAIN A LOT.

08:53.323 --> 08:54.954
WELL, SHE HASN'T COMPLAINED MUCH

08:54.955 --> 08:56.536
IN THE FIVE YEARS
SINCE SHE DIED.

08:58.208 --> 09:00.620
- SHE WHAT?
- SHE DIED.

09:00.621 --> 09:02.622
WHAT ARE YOU HERE TO
TORMENT ME OR SOMETHING?

09:02.623 --> 09:04.463
I JUST CAME HERE TO
THANK YOU FOR THE $400.

09:04.464 --> 09:06.465
I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY BIG OF YOU TO OWN
UP AND START TO PAY FOR THE DAMAGES

09:06.466 --> 09:08.968
- THAT YOU DID TO MY CAR.
- I DIDN'T GIVE YOU ANY $400.

09:08.969 --> 09:11.762
I DON'T WHERE YOU GOT
THAT CRAZY IDEA.

09:12.803 --> 09:15.014
HEY, GUYS.

09:15.015 --> 09:16.806
MEL?

09:16.807 --> 09:18.808
DID YOU TELL ME THINGS
THAT WEREN'T TRUE?

09:18.809 --> 09:21.310
IN A THOUSAND YEARS,

09:21.311 --> 09:23.853
WILL ANY OF IT
REALLY MATTER, JOE?

09:23.854 --> 09:25.775
WHOA.

09:25.776 --> 09:26.946
THIS IS JOE?

09:26.947 --> 09:29.779
THE ONE YOU CALLED A
NARCISSISTIC MEATHEAD?

09:29.780 --> 09:32.191
( laughs )

09:32.192 --> 09:34.954
I SAID THAT ONE TIME. IT WAS
WEEKS BEFORE WE STARTED DATING.

09:34.955 --> 09:37.406
YOU TOLD HIM THAT I APOLOGIZED?

09:37.407 --> 09:39.198
I HAVE NOTHING TO APOLOGIZE FOR.

09:39.199 --> 09:40.790
YOU PARKED OVER THE LINE,

09:40.791 --> 09:43.372
AND I GAVE YOUR HEAP A
LITTLE ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT.

09:43.373 --> 09:44.665
BIG WHOOP.

09:45.796 --> 09:47.627
YOU KNOCKED THE
BUMPER OFF MY CAR.

09:47.628 --> 09:50.209
OH, I'VE KNOCKED THINGS OFF
OF WAY NICER CARS THAN YOURS.

09:50.210 --> 09:52.632
TAKE A HIKE, ROAD RAGE.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.634
I'D BE HAPPY TO, RIGHT AFTER
YOU OPEN THIS THING UP

09:54.635 --> 09:56.716
AND PAY ME WHAT YOU OWE
ME FOR THE DAMAGES.

09:56.717 --> 09:57.807
YOU LAY ONE HAND ON THAT TILL,

09:57.808 --> 09:59.849
AND I WILL TRIM YOU
LIKE A BONSAI TREE.

09:59.850 --> 10:01.641
OH, GUYS GUYS. COME ON.

10:01.642 --> 10:02.852
WE CAN WORK THIS OUT.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.644
ABSOLUTELY, MEL.
I TOTALLY AGREE.

10:04.645 --> 10:05.855
EVERYBODY? EXCUSE ME.

10:05.856 --> 10:07.106
CAN I HAVE YOUR
ATTENTION PLEASE?

10:07.107 --> 10:08.527
HI. YEAH, THIS WOMAN RIGHT HERE?

10:08.528 --> 10:10.109
HIT-AND-RUN FELON.
CRASHED INTO MY CAR,

10:10.110 --> 10:11.901
AND NOW SHE'S TRYING
TO TRIM PARTS OF ME.

10:11.902 --> 10:12.942
THAT'S RIGHT. I SUGGEST YOU GRAB

10:12.943 --> 10:14.033
YOUR PERSONAL BELONGINGS

10:14.034 --> 10:15.785
AND LEAVE THE
PREMISES RIGHT NOW.

10:15.786 --> 10:17.036
EVERYBODY, SIT DOWN.

10:17.037 --> 10:18.367
THIS IS A CRAZY MAN.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.159
HE'S OFF HIS ROCKER
AND OFF HIS MEDS.

10:20.160 --> 10:21.951
LOOK, I'LL CALM HIM DOWN.
JUST HOLD MY CHAIR.

10:21.952 --> 10:23.873
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
- NO NO NO NO. YOU WON'T.

10:23.874 --> 10:25.955
CONSIDER YOURSELF BANNED.

10:25.956 --> 10:27.917
FOR LIFE.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.008
BANNED FOR LIFE?

10:29.009 --> 10:31.210
YOUR BOYFRIEND HURT
ME, YOU HURT ME.

10:31.211 --> 10:32.752
BUT MY HAIR, IT'S
ONLY HALF DONE.

10:32.753 --> 10:34.133
YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'RE
LEAVING WITH YOUR HEAD.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.805
- NOW GET OUT.
- ( stammers )

10:35.806 --> 10:37.216
BUT MY HAIR!

10:37.217 --> 10:38.637
MY HAIR DID NOTHING.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.640
MY HAIR IS AN INNOCENT VICTIM.

10:44.354 --> 10:46.605
BOBBY'S MOM HAS BLUE EYES.

10:46.606 --> 10:48.107
BOBBY'S DAD HAS BLUE EYES,

10:48.108 --> 10:50.609
BUT BOBBY HAS BROWN EYES.

10:50.610 --> 10:51.862
WHAT'S THAT TELL US?

10:52.983 --> 10:54.033
BASED ON OUR KNOWLEDGE
OF GENETICS,

10:54.034 --> 10:55.775
WE CAN SAY WITH NEAR CERTAINTY

10:55.776 --> 10:58.328
BOBBY'S MOM SLEPT AROUND.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.080
WHOA WHOA WHOA. EXCUSE ME.

11:01.081 --> 11:02.952
OH, SORRY, MR. MCKAY,

11:02.953 --> 11:05.624
BUT THIS IS MY GRAND GESTURE,

11:05.625 --> 11:08.207
SO IT'LL JUST TAKE ONE
MINUTE AND NINE SECONDS.

11:08.208 --> 11:09.548
EH, GO AHEAD.

11:09.549 --> 11:11.590
I NEED A NEW STORY FOR
THE TEACHER'S LOUNGE.

GOOD NEWS IS THIS IS PROBABLY

12:15.445 --> 12:16.616
THE LOW POINT IN YOUR LIFE.

12:17.778 --> 12:20.200
( school bell rings )

12:26.206 --> 12:27.957
THAT WAS VERY SWEET.

12:27.958 --> 12:29.789
SHE'S LUCKY TO HAVE A GUY

12:29.790 --> 12:31.832
WHO'D HUMILIATE HIMSELF
IN PUBLIC FOR HER.

12:32.833 --> 12:34.835
THAT'S HOW I DO.

12:42.803 --> 12:43.973
HEY, HOW IS EVERYTHING IN THERE?

12:43.974 --> 12:44.974
WILL HER HAIR LIVE?

12:44.975 --> 12:46.225
I DON'T KNOW.

12:46.226 --> 12:48.387
THOSE CHEMICALS WERE ON HER
HAIR A REALLY LONG TIME.

12:48.388 --> 12:50.019
I AM ON MY THIRD
BOTTLE OF HOT OIL,

12:50.020 --> 12:54.153
BUT IT'S NOT TAKING. HER HAIR
IS REJECTING THE MOISTURE.

12:54.154 --> 12:55.985
WELL, DO SOMETHING, LENNOX.

12:55.986 --> 12:57.606
DAMN IT, JOE. I AM A STUDENT,

12:57.607 --> 12:58.948
NOT A COSMETOLOGIST.

12:58.949 --> 13:00.159
I CAN'T WORK MIRACLES.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.951
Mel: HURRY, LENNOX!

13:01.952 --> 13:03.782
IT'S BREAKING OFF IN CLUMPS!

13:03.783 --> 13:06.115
I WOULD GO BACK TO CALISTA,
BUT SOMEBODY GOT ME BANNED.

13:06.116 --> 13:08.828
YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT
SOMEONE IS YOU, JOE.

13:08.829 --> 13:10.619
MM-HMM. YEP. I'M THE BAD GUY.

13:10.620 --> 13:12.872
BECAUSE I'M THE ONE THAT ALLOWED
MY CAR TO SIT PARKED IN A LOT

13:12.873 --> 13:14.373
WHILE CALISTA RAMMED INTO IT,

13:14.374 --> 13:15.794
AND THEN, ON TOP OF
THAT I HAD THE NERVE

13:15.795 --> 13:18.377
TO BELIEVE MY GIRLFRIEND
WHILE SHE LIED TO MY FACE.

13:18.378 --> 13:19.628
I AM AWFUL.

13:19.629 --> 13:20.970
( sighs )

13:20.971 --> 13:22.471
JOE, YOU KNOW, HAIR IS A REALLY

13:22.472 --> 13:23.802
TOUCHY SUBJECT FOR WOMEN.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.555
ALONG WITH WEIGHT, AGE,

13:26.556 --> 13:28.637
APPEARANCE, SKIN,

13:28.638 --> 13:30.139
- MOODS...
- LOOK LOOK LOOK LOOK.

13:30.140 --> 13:32.101
IT'S ABOUT THE
PRINCIPLE OF THINGS.

13:32.102 --> 13:33.603
RIGHT IS RIGHT.

13:38.198 --> 13:39.859
THE UNIVERSE IS
PUNISHING ME, JOE.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.820
THROUGH MY HAIR.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.202
YOU KNOW WHAT? PLEASE LEAVE.

13:43.203 --> 13:45.824
I JUST... I DON'T WANT
ANYONE TO SEE ME LIKE THIS.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.036
MEL.

13:47.037 --> 13:48.287
COME ON, HONEY.

13:48.288 --> 13:49.788
( stammers )

13:49.789 --> 13:51.210
IT'S NOT THAT...

13:51.211 --> 13:53.213
THAT BAD.

13:57.377 --> 14:00.379
- IT'LL GROW BACK.
- NOT BEFORE THE MAYOR'S BANQUET TOMORROW.

14:00.380 --> 14:01.630
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT
GOING TO THAT BANQUET

14:01.631 --> 14:04.633
OR ANYWHERE ELSE
PEOPLE HAVE EYES.

14:04.634 --> 14:07.226
IT'S LIKE I'M NEVER GOING
ANYWHERE EVER AGAIN.

14:07.227 --> 14:08.228
( crying )

14:10.270 --> 14:12.021
YOU KNOW WHAT, HONEY?

14:12.022 --> 14:14.853
YOUR... YOUR SKIN LOOKS GREAT.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.936
AND ALL THINGS CONSIDERED,

14:16.937 --> 14:18.027
YOUR MOOD IS...

14:18.028 --> 14:19.569
IS PRETTY GOOD TOO.

14:27.537 --> 14:29.949
LOOK, JOE, THE ONLY WAY TO
MAKE AUNT MEL FEEL BETTER

14:29.950 --> 14:31.370
IS FOR YOU TO
APOLOGIZE TO CALISTA

14:31.371 --> 14:32.621
SO SHE'LL TAKE HER BACK.

14:32.622 --> 14:34.043
THERE'S A THOUSAND OTHER
HAIRDRESSERS OUT THERE.

14:34.044 --> 14:35.334
CAN'T SHE JUST PICK ANOTHER ONE?

14:35.335 --> 14:37.206
OKAY, DO YOU REMEMBER

14:37.207 --> 14:38.627
WHEN YOUR REGULAR
MECHANIC, HEINRICK,

14:38.628 --> 14:40.209
WAS AWAY AND AUNT MEL
SAID, "JUST TAKE THE NOVA

14:40.210 --> 14:41.880
TO THE QUICKIE LUBE,"
AND YOU TURNED PURPLE

14:41.881 --> 14:43.342
AND YOU COULDN'T SPEAK?

14:43.343 --> 14:45.344
YEAH, THAT WAS A CAR.

14:45.345 --> 14:47.887
HAIR IS A WOMAN'S CAR.

14:49.219 --> 14:51.271
OH MY GOD. I FEEL
SO TERRIBLE NOW.

14:52.472 --> 14:53.933
OKAY. ALL RIGHT, FINE.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.394
I'LL GO DOWN THERE.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.775
BUT I'M NOT GONNA
GROVEL, ALL RIGHT?

14:56.776 --> 14:57.856
I'M GONNA GO IN THERE,
I'M GONNA PLAY HARDBALL.

14:57.857 --> 14:59.108
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

14:59.109 --> 15:00.109
YOU'RE GONNA BE A GROWN-UP,

15:00.110 --> 15:01.400
AND I'M COMING WITH YOU.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.232
TO WHAT? KEEP A LEASH ON ME?

15:03.233 --> 15:05.444
NO, JUST TO KEEP A STRONG
LEATHER STRAP AROUND YOUR NECK

15:05.445 --> 15:07.866
AND YANK IT IF YOU
GET OUT OF LINE.

15:07.867 --> 15:10.489
OH, I GUESS THAT IS KIND
OF LIKE A LEASH, HUH?

15:10.490 --> 15:11.491
( doorbell rings )

15:13.994 --> 15:16.205
- HI.
- HEY.

15:16.206 --> 15:18.087
CAN WE TALK?

15:18.088 --> 15:19.628
YEAH. YEAH, OF COURSE.

15:19.629 --> 15:22.631
LISTEN, UM, I'M SORRY THAT I
EMBARRASSED YOU AT SCHOOL.

15:22.632 --> 15:24.803
I CAN DO THE SONG A LOT
BETTER NOW ACTUALLY.

15:24.804 --> 15:26.805
I PUT THE CARDS
ONTO A POWERPOINT,

15:26.806 --> 15:28.007
SO...

15:28.008 --> 15:29.468
COME IN. COME ON.

15:29.469 --> 15:31.220
UM...

15:31.221 --> 15:32.641
LOOK.

15:32.642 --> 15:36.185
RYDER, WHAT YOU DID WAS
REALLY REALLY SWEET.

15:36.186 --> 15:38.147
I WAS JUST CAUGHT OFF GUARD.

15:38.148 --> 15:40.019
LOOK, WE NEVER SHOULD
HAVE BROKEN UP.

15:40.020 --> 15:41.360
OKAY?

15:41.361 --> 15:42.861
ALL THAT STUFF THAT YOU
READ ON MY COMPUTER,

15:42.862 --> 15:44.523
I WROTE THAT WHEN I THOUGHT

15:44.524 --> 15:46.195
YOU WERE TRYING TO PUSH ME AWAY.

15:46.196 --> 15:48.197
GUESS I KIND OF WAS.

15:48.198 --> 15:51.200
I'M SORRY, BUT IT'S LIKE
YOU SAID IN YOUR LETTER,

15:51.201 --> 15:52.871
SOME THINGS JUST
AREN'T MEANT TO BE.

15:52.872 --> 15:54.623
UH, JOE WROTE THAT PART.

15:54.624 --> 15:57.126
HE'S GOT A LOT OF ISSUES.

15:57.127 --> 15:59.788
RYDER, IT'S NOT YOU, OKAY?

15:59.789 --> 16:01.920
IT'S... MY BABY.

16:01.921 --> 16:03.462
THAT...

16:03.463 --> 16:04.963
THAT IS A NEW VERSION OF THAT.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.796
- ( sighs )
- ( Isabel crying )

16:08.218 --> 16:10.639
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M JUST...

16:10.640 --> 16:12.801
I'M NOT IN A PLACE
EMOTIONALLY RIGHT NOW

16:12.802 --> 16:14.894
WHERE I CAN OPEN
UP TO A BOYFRIEND.

16:16.686 --> 16:19.188
BUT IF I HAD THE TIME
AND SPACE IN MY LIFE

16:19.189 --> 16:21.190
FOR A GROWN MAN,

16:21.191 --> 16:22.362
IT WOULD BE YOU.

16:26.606 --> 16:27.947
GOOD-BYE, RYDER.

16:35.205 --> 16:37.206
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

16:37.207 --> 16:39.208
I'M GONNA BE OKAY.

16:39.209 --> 16:40.789
I'M GONNA BE OKAY.

16:40.790 --> 16:42.621
FIRST THING I GOTTA DO

16:42.622 --> 16:45.215
IS STOP TALKING TO MYSELF.

16:48.838 --> 16:51.010
( inaudible )

16:53.803 --> 16:55.634
OUT OF MY SHOP, ROAD RAGE,

16:55.635 --> 16:58.016
OR I WILL COME AT YOU WITH
RAZOR BLADES AND LEMONADE.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.900
- LOOK, LADY...
- REMEMBER. GROWN-UP.

17:01.901 --> 17:04.443
CALISTA... ( chuckles )

17:04.444 --> 17:07.276
LISTEN, WE BOTH CARE ABOUT MEL.

17:07.277 --> 17:10.199
OKAY? THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS I CAN'T
REALLY HELP HER OUT RIGHT NOW.

17:10.200 --> 17:13.202
'CAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS
THOSE MAGIC HANDS THAT CAN HEAL.

17:13.203 --> 17:15.364
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY WE
JUST ACT LIKE GROWN-UPS,

17:15.365 --> 17:17.656
PUT OUR DIFFERENCES
ASIDE AND FOCUS ON MEL?

17:17.657 --> 17:18.787
OKAY?

17:18.788 --> 17:20.709
CAN YOU... CAN YOU
HELP ME OUT HERE?

17:20.710 --> 17:22.211
NOT IF HELPING HER

17:22.212 --> 17:24.923
MEANS HELPING YOU.

17:24.924 --> 17:27.045
I'M ASKING YOU NICELY.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.928
AND I'M REJECTING
YOU WITH ATTITUDE.

17:29.929 --> 17:32.512
SHE SEEMS TO HAVE SAID NO.

17:33.633 --> 17:35.514
YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE
IF I TALK TO HER.

17:35.515 --> 17:37.766
HEY, CALISTA.

17:37.767 --> 17:40.099
LOOK, I JUST THINK YOU AND JOE
GOT OFF ON THE WRONG FOOT,

17:40.100 --> 17:41.980
AND WE CAME ALL THE
WAY DOWN HERE...

17:41.981 --> 17:43.942
WHAT ARE YOU HERE FOR?
TO PULL HIS LEASH

17:43.943 --> 17:46.855
OR TO FIX THAT WRECK
THAT'S ON YOUR HEAD?

17:46.856 --> 17:48.947
I GET A LOT OF COMPLIMENTS
ON THIS HAIR STYLE.

17:48.948 --> 17:52.742
ARE YOU GOING FOR THE
SLUTTY BALLERINA LOOK?

17:53.783 --> 17:55.864
SHE'S SO NOT EASY
TO LIKE, RIGHT?

17:55.865 --> 17:57.286
OKAY. OKAY, SISTER.

17:57.287 --> 17:58.787
YOU WANT TO PLAY HARDBALL?

17:58.788 --> 18:00.619
THIS IS WHAT MEL LOOKED LIKE
WHEN SHE LEFT YOUR SALON.

18:00.620 --> 18:01.790
- OH.
- AND WITH ONE CLICK,

18:01.791 --> 18:02.791
I WILL INSTAGRAM THIS
WITH THE CAPTION

18:02.792 --> 18:04.753
- "HAIR BY CALISTA."
- OH!

18:04.754 --> 18:06.965
AND BY THE WAY, I HAVE
OVER 10,000 FOLLOWERS.

18:06.966 --> 18:09.007
AND I'M HITTING SEND.

18:09.008 --> 18:10.469
WAIT WAIT WAIT.

18:10.470 --> 18:13.132
OKAY, HAVE HER COME IN AND
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

18:13.133 --> 18:14.553
- NO CHARGE.
- NO CHARGE?

18:14.554 --> 18:16.215
FINE. NO CHARGE.

18:16.216 --> 18:17.476
4:00 TODAY.

18:17.477 --> 18:19.808
BUT HE'S BANNED FOR LIFE.

18:19.809 --> 18:21.930
( mockingly groans )

18:21.931 --> 18:23.982
( mouths )

18:23.983 --> 18:27.606
YOU KNOW, JOE? I'M
REALLY PROUD OF YOU.

18:27.607 --> 18:28.937
YOU HANDLED OUR
TRIP TO THE SALON

18:28.938 --> 18:31.029
WITH INCREDIBLE
MATURITY AND RESTRAINT.

18:31.030 --> 18:33.612
DAMN STRAIGHT. WHO
WANTS CONDITIONER?

18:33.613 --> 18:34.783
HUH?

18:34.784 --> 18:36.155
WIPED THAT LADY OUT.

18:36.156 --> 18:37.866
YOU DO KNOW THE SHAMPOO COMPANY

18:37.867 --> 18:39.198
GIVES THOSE AWAY TO EVERY SALON?

18:39.199 --> 18:41.620
LET ME JUST ENJOY THAT
LITTLE VICTORY, OKAY?

18:41.621 --> 18:42.791
IT'S ABOUT AS HAPPY
AS I'M GONNA GET.

18:42.792 --> 18:44.373
WHY? WE WON.

18:44.374 --> 18:46.875
I HAD TO SWALLOW A LOT TO
GO DOWN THERE, ALL RIGHT?

18:46.876 --> 18:48.507
YOU KNOW, THE LEAST THAT MEL
COULD SAY IS "HEY, JOE,

18:48.508 --> 18:49.838
YOU WERE RIGHT ALL ALONG."

18:49.839 --> 18:51.960
WHAT IS THIS OBSESSION YOU
HAVE WITH BEING RIGHT?

18:51.961 --> 18:54.514
DO YOU WANT TO BE RIGHT OR DO YOU
WANT TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP?

18:55.805 --> 18:56.925
CAN'T I HAVE BOTH?

18:56.926 --> 18:59.719
YES, BUT YOU'LL HAVE
TO DATE YOURSELF.

19:01.181 --> 19:03.602
HEY, THERE SHE IS.

19:03.603 --> 19:04.763
HOW'S THE...

19:04.764 --> 19:06.225
HOW'S THE PATIENT?

19:06.226 --> 19:09.188
YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO BE
TALKING TO ME RIGHT NOW.

19:09.189 --> 19:10.479
- I AM...
- REALLY?

19:10.480 --> 19:11.770
I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS.

19:11.771 --> 19:14.363
BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAS
AN APPOINTMENT TODAY

19:14.364 --> 19:16.195
AT 4:00 WITH CALISTA.

19:16.196 --> 19:18.777
AND SHE HAS PROMISED
TO WORK HER MAGIC.

19:18.778 --> 19:20.038
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT, HUH?

19:20.039 --> 19:21.780
YOU WENT DOWN THERE?

19:21.781 --> 19:23.622
THANK YOU.

19:23.623 --> 19:25.414
WAIT, YOU DIDN'T
HURT HER, DID YOU?

19:25.415 --> 19:26.785
NO, NO. LOOK, I WENT DOWN THERE

19:26.786 --> 19:28.046
BECAUSE IT WAS...

19:28.047 --> 19:29.878
IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

19:29.879 --> 19:31.460
AW, YOU'RE THE BEST.

19:31.461 --> 19:32.791
MWAH. ( chuckles )

19:32.792 --> 19:34.963
NOW LOOK, THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO FOR ME.

19:34.964 --> 19:37.055
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT I
NEED YOU TO ACKNOWLEDGE.

19:37.056 --> 19:38.797
- YEAH, WHAT'S THAT?
- ( clears throat )

19:38.798 --> 19:40.219
WELL...

19:40.220 --> 19:41.970
I NEED YOU TO ACKNOWLEDGE...

19:41.971 --> 19:43.893
( coughing )

19:47.767 --> 19:49.608
THAT...

19:49.609 --> 19:51.770
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL NO MATTER
WHAT YOUR HAIR LOOKS LIKE.

19:51.771 --> 19:53.943
BECAUSE YOUR BEAUTY
COMES FROM INSIDE.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.115
OR SOMEWHERE.

19:57.116 --> 20:00.619
AWW, JOE, THAT'S SO SWEET.

20:00.620 --> 20:03.622
AND YOU LIE SO MUCH
BETTER THAN I DO.

20:03.623 --> 20:04.783
OH, WAIT.

20:04.784 --> 20:06.955
4:00? OH, OKAY.

20:06.956 --> 20:09.628
YEAH, I BETTER GO BECAUSE I
CANNOT MAKE CALISTA WAIT.

20:09.629 --> 20:10.790
THAT WOMAN HAS A TEMPER.

20:12.041 --> 20:14.833
I DIDN'T... I
DIDN'T NOTICE THAT.

20:14.834 --> 20:16.795
( groans )

20:16.796 --> 20:18.887
YOU MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE.

20:18.888 --> 20:20.799
YEAH, I JUST SOLD OUT
MY PERSONAL CONVICTIONS

20:20.800 --> 20:22.220
TO KEEP PEACE WITH
MY GIRLFRIEND.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.972
THAT'S LOVE.

20:23.973 --> 20:26.054
IT'S NOT VERY SATISFYING.

20:26.055 --> 20:27.397
THAT'S LOVE.

20:31.190 --> 20:32.772
( school bell rings )

20:35.615 --> 20:36.775
HEY, RYDER.

20:36.776 --> 20:38.777
UM, SO I HEARD YOU AND STELLA

20:38.778 --> 20:41.450
ARE SORT OF OVER?

20:41.451 --> 20:44.283
YEAH, WE'RE WHAT
YOU CALL "DONE."

20:44.284 --> 20:45.454
LISTEN, YOU LEFT
THIS ON THE FLOOR,

20:45.455 --> 20:47.205
AND...

20:47.206 --> 20:48.827
I THOUGHT I'D GIVE IT TO YOU.

20:48.828 --> 20:50.208
YEAH.

20:50.209 --> 20:51.790
TOSS IT.

20:51.791 --> 20:53.542
IT MOCKS ME.

20:53.543 --> 20:56.214
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

20:56.215 --> 20:59.678
I'M GIVING THIS TO YOU.

20:59.679 --> 21:01.800
NO. I MEAN, I'M
DONE WITH THE SONG.

21:01.801 --> 21:03.882
SO THAT'S IT.

21:03.883 --> 21:07.596
I'M GIVING THIS...

21:07.597 --> 21:09.268
TO YOU.

21:11.851 --> 21:14.693
OHH.

21:14.694 --> 21:16.274
UH...

21:16.275 --> 21:17.357
ALICE, RIGHT?

21:20.570 --> 21:21.900
DO YOU WANT TO GO TO
THE ZOO SOMETIME?

21:21.901 --> 21:23.952
I HEARD THEY HAVE A NEW MANATEE.

21:23.953 --> 21:26.245
THEY DO.
