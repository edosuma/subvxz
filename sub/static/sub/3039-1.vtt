03:08.773 --> 03:12.776
<i>Some people are born into
the wrong time and place.</i>

03:12.777 --> 03:16.112
<i>This was the American
frontier in 1882.</i>

03:16.113 --> 03:18.948
<i>A hard land for hard folk.</i>

03:18.949 --> 03:20.367
<i>Food was scarce,</i>

03:20.368 --> 03:21.993
<i>disease was rampant,</i>

03:21.994 --> 03:25.163
<i>and life was a daily
struggle for survival.</i>

03:25.164 --> 03:28.667
<i>Hell, this was Miss
America in 1880.</i>

03:28.668 --> 03:30.960
<i>Holy shit.</i>

03:30.961 --> 03:34.964
<i>To build a home and a life in
this harsh, unforgiving country</i>

03:34.965 --> 03:40.503
<i>required that a man be bold,
fearless, and tough as iron.</i>

03:40.680 --> 03:42.764
<i>The men who were
courageous and resilient</i>

03:42.765 --> 03:44.808
<i>were the men who prospered.</i>

03:44.809 --> 03:49.679
<i>But some men were just
big, giant pussies.</i>

03:57.071 --> 03:58.988
Well, well.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.408
Surprised you showed up, Stark.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.410
Yeah, well, you said you
would kill my family

04:03.411 --> 04:06.279
and burn my house down
if I didn't, so...

04:07.832 --> 04:09.332
Draw.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.836
Is there anything at
all that I can say

04:12.837 --> 04:14.546
to get you to call this off?

04:14.547 --> 04:16.755
You yellow, Stark?

04:16.757 --> 04:20.719
Oh, okay, well, that's a little
racist to our hardworking friends

04:20.720 --> 04:23.755
over here from the Far
East, right, guys?

04:24.140 --> 04:25.890
Draw, you son of a bitch!

04:25.891 --> 04:28.852
Look, I just feel like if we
can talk this out, you know,

04:28.853 --> 04:31.396
we can find a calm,
rational solution

04:31.397 --> 04:34.190
and maybe we even laugh
about it one day.

04:34.191 --> 04:36.943
I ain't in the mood
to laugh, Stark!

04:36.944 --> 04:38.945
Look, there's always
humor in any...

04:38.946 --> 04:41.197
Oh, hey, look. This will make
you laugh. Look at our shadows.

04:41.198 --> 04:42.741
It looks like our shadows are
about to kiss each other.

04:42.742 --> 04:43.825
Look at that.

04:43.826 --> 04:46.578
Oh, wait, watch this. Oh,
my God, Charlie. Oh, my God.

04:46.579 --> 04:48.496
Thank you! This is
so generous of you.

04:48.497 --> 04:49.831
Oh, wow! This is...

04:49.832 --> 04:51.458
What a terrific guy you are.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.835
We barely know each other, but, hey,
when it's right, it's right, huh?

04:53.836 --> 04:56.588
I'll give you a little tap on the
hat when I'm good to go, okay?

04:56.589 --> 04:58.882
Look, we're laughing, right?
We're laughing now.

04:58.883 --> 05:00.216
What were we even fighting about?

05:00.217 --> 05:02.418
I can't remember. Can you?

05:03.929 --> 05:07.015
Your goddamn sheep grazed
up half my ranch, Stark.

05:07.016 --> 05:08.725
That grass ain't never
gonna grow back!

05:08.726 --> 05:10.393
All right, look. How about this?

05:10.394 --> 05:12.395
I'll pay you the money
you lost, okay?

05:12.396 --> 05:14.189
Just give me two days to sell off

05:14.190 --> 05:15.565
a few of my sheep and
I'll get you the money.

05:15.566 --> 05:16.816
All right. Just two days.

05:16.817 --> 05:20.528
If I don't have that cash,
I'm coming after ya.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.655
Okay, great. Thank you so
much for your patience.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.324
I really appreciate it.

05:24.325 --> 05:26.326
And what a relief for
all these people

05:26.327 --> 05:28.370
who came out here
hoping that we would

05:28.371 --> 05:30.205
find an amicable
solution to this, huh?

05:30.206 --> 05:32.374
Aw, somebody shoot some fucker!

05:32.375 --> 05:34.959
I took a half-day
off work for this!

05:34.960 --> 05:36.044
Okay, I just want to point out

05:36.045 --> 05:38.838
that guy's an English
teacher at our school.

05:42.259 --> 05:45.295
Just a little taste.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.693
I mean, that should have
been the end of it, right?

05:59.694 --> 06:01.236
I mean, I tell him
I'll pay him off,

06:01.237 --> 06:02.737
we go our separate
ways, and that's it.

06:02.738 --> 06:04.906
But, no, he shoots me
in the fucking leg.

06:04.907 --> 06:08.985
I mean, it's just a graze,
but come on, look at that.

06:12.915 --> 06:15.533
What?

06:15.876 --> 06:18.912
You should have fought him.

06:19.130 --> 06:21.339
I should have fought him?

06:21.340 --> 06:23.258
You're serious.

06:23.259 --> 06:25.969
Louise! My God! The guy is one
of the best shots around.

06:25.970 --> 06:28.763
- I look like I have Parkinson's next to him.
- What is that?

06:28.764 --> 06:32.559
It's just another way God
mysteriously shows that He loves us.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.561
But, look, it would have been
suicide to fight that guy.

06:34.562 --> 06:37.222
Albert, I'm breaking up with you.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.528
What?

06:43.529 --> 06:46.856
Yeah. I'm sorry.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.496
I got shot today.

06:53.497 --> 06:55.540
I know.

06:55.541 --> 06:56.958
Wait, wait, wait. Hang on a sec.

06:56.959 --> 06:58.626
Louise, where is this coming from?

06:58.627 --> 07:00.128
Is this because of the gunfight?

07:00.129 --> 07:03.006
No, I've actually been feeling
this way for a while.

07:03.007 --> 07:04.841
You're a great guy. I just...

07:04.842 --> 07:06.384
I realized that

07:06.385 --> 07:08.386
I want something else.

07:08.387 --> 07:11.097
Something else? Louise, it's
been a year and a half!

07:11.098 --> 07:13.058
Look, I know I'm just a sheep
farmer, but I'm saving money...

07:13.059 --> 07:15.060
Yeah, but you're not even a
good sheep farmer, Albert.

07:15.061 --> 07:16.436
Your sheep are everywhere.

07:16.437 --> 07:18.188
The one thing a sheep
farmer has to do

07:18.189 --> 07:20.106
is keep all of his sheep
in one place, all right.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.858
I went to your farm the other day,

07:21.859 --> 07:23.360
and I saw one in the backyard,

07:23.361 --> 07:24.444
three way up on the ridge,

07:24.445 --> 07:25.820
two in the pond, and
one on the roof.

07:25.821 --> 07:27.072
Okay, that's Bridget, all right?

07:27.073 --> 07:29.240
She has a problem with retardation,
but she's full of love.

07:29.241 --> 07:30.617
Look, we're getting off
track here, all right?

07:30.618 --> 07:33.161
Why don't you just tell
me what the problem is

07:33.162 --> 07:34.371
and then maybe I can fix it?

07:34.372 --> 07:35.830
Maybe if I were older,

07:35.831 --> 07:37.749
the timing would be right.

07:37.750 --> 07:39.876
But people are living
to be 35 these days

07:39.877 --> 07:42.087
and a girl doesn't
have to just go off

07:42.088 --> 07:44.214
and get married right away.

07:44.215 --> 07:46.216
I just, I have to...

07:46.217 --> 07:48.259
I have to work on myself.

07:48.260 --> 07:49.344
Oh, my God.

07:49.345 --> 07:50.804
- You did not just say that.
- What?

07:50.805 --> 07:52.013
"I have to work on myself."

07:52.014 --> 07:53.139
Louise, that's the
oldest line in the book.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.224
You realize that.

07:54.225 --> 07:55.558
You know what, it's okay, though.

07:55.559 --> 07:56.893
It's all right. I know
why you're saying it.

07:56.894 --> 07:59.270
It's because you don't want to
tell me that I'm the problem.

08:01.315 --> 08:04.142
Goodbye, Albert.

08:08.656 --> 08:12.025
Goodbye? Wait. Louise. Louise!

08:12.952 --> 08:14.661
I love you.

08:14.662 --> 08:17.655
I'm sorry.

08:31.178 --> 08:34.097
Yeah! Oh, come on, come on!

08:34.097 --> 08:36.265
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

08:36.267 --> 08:37.892
You like me fucking you, don't you?

08:37.893 --> 08:40.227
I do. It's really terrific.

08:40.229 --> 08:43.273
- Yeah! Oh! Ah! Yeah!
- Oh...

08:48.404 --> 08:49.612
Ah...

08:49.613 --> 08:50.739
Hi, Edward.

08:50.740 --> 08:51.823
Hi, Millie.

08:51.824 --> 08:53.283
You waiting for Ruth?

08:53.284 --> 08:56.619
Yeah, I got off work early, so I
thought I'd take her out for a picnic.

08:58.122 --> 08:59.456
It sounds like she's just
about done up there.

08:59.457 --> 09:02.792
Shoot that dirty cowboy
cum all over my face!

09:02.793 --> 09:03.918
Do I look okay?

09:03.919 --> 09:05.295
Yeah, you look good.

09:05.296 --> 09:06.588
- You look good.
- Oh, good.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.715
Say, Edward, do you mind
if I ask you something?

09:08.716 --> 09:09.799
Uh, yeah, sure.

09:09.800 --> 09:13.845
You're okay with your girlfriend
screwing 15 different guys every day

09:13.846 --> 09:15.597
and getting paid to do it?

09:15.598 --> 09:17.807
Well, my job sucks, too.

09:17.808 --> 09:21.061
I know. But, I mean,
you repair shoes.

09:21.062 --> 09:22.479
Eddie!

09:22.480 --> 09:23.688
Oh, hi, sweetie.

09:23.689 --> 09:25.732
What are you doing here?

09:25.733 --> 09:27.233
Well, I got off work early

09:27.234 --> 09:29.694
and I thought we could go
for a walk by the stream.

09:29.695 --> 09:31.321
- Oh.
- Oh...

09:31.322 --> 09:33.031
Oh, your breath is, uh...

09:33.032 --> 09:34.407
Ooh! Ooh.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.534
- I had to give a blowjob. Sorry.
- Oh, that's okay.

09:36.535 --> 09:38.096
It's okay. Here, I got
you some flowers.

09:38.704 --> 09:40.663
- They're beautiful!
- Yeah, come on.

09:40.664 --> 09:43.291
Don't I have the best
boyfriend, Millie?

09:43.292 --> 09:45.585
Honestly, I have no fucking idea.

09:45.586 --> 09:46.670
Bye!

09:46.671 --> 09:49.673
Oh, hey, Ruthie, Clyde Hodgkins
wanted to come by a little later on.

09:49.674 --> 09:51.007
What did he want?

09:51.008 --> 09:52.592
I think he wants anal.

09:52.593 --> 09:55.387
Oh, honey, we can afford to get
you that new belt for church!

09:55.388 --> 09:56.513
Oh, that would be great!

09:56.514 --> 09:57.597
I know!

09:57.598 --> 09:59.391
So, like, 5:30? Does that work?

09:59.392 --> 10:01.351
Ah, that should work. Yeah.

10:01.352 --> 10:03.812
Well, what time is his appointment?

10:03.813 --> 10:07.065
Uh, it's really not like a
dentist's office here, Edward.

10:07.066 --> 10:08.733
You know, he'll just come by

10:08.734 --> 10:11.861
when he feels like putting
his penis inside an asshole.

10:11.862 --> 10:13.863
Yeah, so we'll just say 5:30.

10:13.864 --> 10:16.274
Okay.

10:29.588 --> 10:31.715
Oh, shit.

10:44.854 --> 10:47.022
You're late.

10:47.023 --> 10:49.107
For what?

10:49.108 --> 10:51.601
Fair enough.

11:08.294 --> 11:10.787
Albert.

11:11.422 --> 11:12.547
Hey, guys.

11:12.548 --> 11:14.174
We heard about Louise.

11:14.175 --> 11:15.925
That's horrible.

11:15.926 --> 11:17.594
We're so sorry, Albert.

11:17.595 --> 11:20.129
Do you want to sit down?

11:20.306 --> 11:24.142
I'm good. I'm gonna
rest my asshole.

11:24.143 --> 11:27.604
I was just looking at these old
pictures of me and Louise.

11:27.605 --> 11:29.356
This is from the carnival.

11:29.357 --> 11:31.232
Oh, yeah.

11:31.233 --> 11:33.568
There's the town picnic.

11:33.569 --> 11:34.652
Oh.

11:34.653 --> 11:36.988
This is the square dance.

11:36.989 --> 11:40.241
I almost wish you could
smile in photographs.

11:40.242 --> 11:42.619
Louise has such an amazing smile.

11:42.620 --> 11:44.788
- That'd be weird.
- Huh?

11:44.789 --> 11:46.790
Have you ever smiled
in a photograph?

11:46.791 --> 11:48.458
- No, have you?
- Oh, God, no.

11:48.459 --> 11:50.126
No, you'd look like
an insane person.

11:50.127 --> 11:52.295
But, it's just, you know,
I've been sitting here

11:52.296 --> 11:54.506
trying to figure out how the hell

11:54.507 --> 11:56.508
I could have screwed this up.

11:56.509 --> 11:58.468
I did everything for her.

11:58.469 --> 12:00.387
If she was happy, I was happy.

12:00.388 --> 12:02.514
That's all I cared about.

12:02.515 --> 12:07.644
And she was the one thing
that made the shootings,

12:07.645 --> 12:10.647
and the diseases, and the wild
animals, and the Indians,

12:10.648 --> 12:15.101
and the general depressing
awfulness about the West

12:15.403 --> 12:17.854
bearable.

12:18.739 --> 12:21.658
God, I love her so much.

12:21.659 --> 12:24.327
You're gonna make me cry.

12:24.328 --> 12:27.080
- Let's get fucked up.
- Yeah.

12:36.173 --> 12:37.716
So, what are you gonna do?

12:37.717 --> 12:38.842
Uh...

12:38.843 --> 12:40.468
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

12:40.469 --> 12:41.678
Commit suicide, maybe.

12:41.679 --> 12:44.139
Albert, I know everything
seems hopeless right now,

12:44.140 --> 12:47.767
but I promise you, there's
so much to live for.

12:47.768 --> 12:49.185
Really? Is there?

12:49.186 --> 12:52.522
What is there to live for on
the frontier in 1882? Huh?

12:52.523 --> 12:54.024
Look, let me tell you something.

12:54.025 --> 12:56.609
We live in a terrible
place and time.

12:56.610 --> 13:00.321
The American West is a disgusting,
awful, dirty, dangerous place.

13:00.322 --> 13:01.364
Look around you.

13:01.365 --> 13:04.034
Everything out here that's
not you wants to kill you.

13:04.035 --> 13:07.537
Outlaws, angry drunk people,
scorned hookers, hungry animals,

13:07.538 --> 13:11.041
diseases, major and minor
injuries, Indians, the weather.

13:11.042 --> 13:12.834
You can get killed just
going to the bathroom.

13:12.835 --> 13:15.879
I take my life in my hands every
time I walk out to my outhouse.

13:15.880 --> 13:17.881
There's fucking rattlesnakes
all in the grass out there.

13:17.882 --> 13:20.300
And even if I make it, you
know what can kill me?

13:20.301 --> 13:22.135
Cholera. You know cholera?

13:22.136 --> 13:24.220
- The Black Shit.
- The Black Shit.

13:24.221 --> 13:27.098
The latest offering in the frontier's
disease-of-the-month club.

13:27.099 --> 13:29.809
And even if you survive
all those things,

13:29.810 --> 13:31.019
you know what else can kill you?

13:31.020 --> 13:33.730
The fucking doctor.
The doctor can kill you.

13:33.731 --> 13:35.357
I had a cold a couple of
years ago. I went in there.

13:35.358 --> 13:36.566
You know what he
said to me? He goes,

13:36.567 --> 13:37.734
"Oh, you need an ear nail."

13:37.735 --> 13:39.361
A nail in my fucking ear.

13:39.362 --> 13:40.528
That is modern medicine for you.

13:40.529 --> 13:41.905
"Yeah, Doc, I have a fever of 102."

13:41.906 --> 13:43.573
"Oh, you need a donkey kickin'."

13:43.574 --> 13:46.826
You know our pastor has
shot two people? Our pastor.

13:46.827 --> 13:47.911
- No, no.
- No.

13:47.912 --> 13:49.371
Honest to God. Shot a guy in a duel

13:49.372 --> 13:52.082
and then went back and
killed the guy's teenage son

13:52.083 --> 13:54.042
because he was afraid he would
kill him out of revenge.

13:54.043 --> 13:55.585
Wait, how do you know that?

13:55.586 --> 13:58.254
Because he did a whole
fucking sermon about it!

13:58.255 --> 14:00.715
A lesson about seeing
things through.

14:00.716 --> 14:02.258
By the way, look at this.
See those guys over there?

14:02.259 --> 14:04.427
The guys who work in the silver
mines? See what they're eating?

14:04.428 --> 14:05.762
Ribs doused in hot sauce.

14:05.763 --> 14:08.223
They eat hot spicy foods
every meal of the day.

14:08.224 --> 14:09.349
Do you know why?

14:09.350 --> 14:11.434
Because their palates are so
completely fucking dulled

14:11.435 --> 14:14.187
from inhaling poisoned gas, 12
hours a day, down in the mines.

14:14.188 --> 14:15.563
That's all they can taste.

14:15.564 --> 14:17.190
You know what that kind of
diet does to your guts?

14:17.191 --> 14:19.943
Constipation, cramps,
dyspepsia, liver disease,

14:19.944 --> 14:22.612
kidney disease, hemorrhoids,
bowel inflammation.

14:22.613 --> 14:25.899
They literally die
from their own farts.

14:29.578 --> 14:31.538
And, oh, oh, you want
to see more death?

14:31.539 --> 14:35.375
All we got to do is get up
and walk out the front door.

14:35.376 --> 14:36.835
That is our mayor.

14:36.836 --> 14:37.919
He is dead.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.130
He has been lying there,
dead, for three days.

14:40.131 --> 14:41.631
No one has done a thing.

14:41.632 --> 14:44.592
Not moved him, not
looked into his death,

14:44.593 --> 14:46.803
not even replaced him with
a temporary appointee.

14:46.804 --> 14:50.640
For the last three days, the
highest-ranking official in our town

14:50.641 --> 14:52.225
has been a dead guy.

14:52.226 --> 14:54.644
Oh! Look at that! Look at that!

14:54.645 --> 14:58.565
Wolves are dragging the body
away as if to illustrate my point!

14:58.566 --> 15:00.316
Bye! Bye, Mr. Mayor!

15:00.317 --> 15:02.652
Bye! Have fun becoming wolf shit!
Bye!

15:02.653 --> 15:03.987
God!

15:03.988 --> 15:06.406
That, my friends, is
the American West.

15:06.407 --> 15:10.660
A disgusting, awful, dirty cesspool
of despair, and fuck all of it.

15:10.661 --> 15:11.828
Why don't you shut up?

15:11.829 --> 15:14.030
You shut up!

15:18.377 --> 15:19.502
Mmm, mmm...

15:19.503 --> 15:22.464
Ow! Ruth. Jesus Christ.

15:22.465 --> 15:24.591
- Stop it.
- Okay, fine.

15:24.592 --> 15:27.844
At least have Dr. Harper
take a look at it tomorrow.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.681
If you could hear
yourself right now.

15:31.682 --> 15:33.516
You know what's gonna happen
if I go to Dr. Harper

15:33.517 --> 15:36.603
and I say, "Take a look at that"?

15:36.604 --> 15:39.272
He's gonna say,
"Oh, that looks like it hurts.

15:39.273 --> 15:41.858
"Let me give you a blue jay
to peck out the blood."

15:41.859 --> 15:43.610
Maybe you should...

15:43.611 --> 15:47.146
I don't know, maybe you
should try to talk to Louise.

15:48.866 --> 15:50.700
- That's a great idea.
- Yeah?

15:50.701 --> 15:53.370
- That's the jackpot. That's the jackpot!
- Huh?

15:53.371 --> 15:55.372
- I still got it!
- Okay.

15:55.373 --> 15:57.540
I have good ideas sometimes.

15:57.541 --> 15:59.876
I didn't mean now!

15:59.877 --> 16:04.038
Hey, hey, dude, you really
shouldn't drink and horse.

16:12.390 --> 16:17.268
No. No. No. No. No. No.

16:24.694 --> 16:27.153
Yeah, there you... Okay.

16:55.891 --> 16:59.102
Okay, Curtis. Curtis, buddy,

16:59.103 --> 17:02.605
I'm gonna be right back.
I'll be right back, okay?

17:02.606 --> 17:04.607
Or not!

17:04.608 --> 17:08.144
No, that's being too ambitious.

17:15.578 --> 17:17.203
Hey. Hey.

17:17.204 --> 17:19.122
Albert, what the
hell are you doing?

17:19.123 --> 17:20.415
Louise, we need to talk.

17:20.415 --> 17:22.459
- It's 1:30 in the morning.
- We need to talk.

17:22.460 --> 17:24.586
- And we need to talk tonight.
- What happened to your face?

17:24.587 --> 17:28.965
I got in a fight with an animal
that I could not identify.

17:28.966 --> 17:30.050
Okay, you're drunk.

17:30.051 --> 17:32.469
I'm a smucks-dinnin' drunk.

17:32.470 --> 17:34.804
I don't know what you want
from me, but it's late.

17:34.805 --> 17:35.930
- I gotta go.
- Louise! Louise!

17:35.931 --> 17:38.308
Louise, please, listen to me.
I love you, okay?

17:38.309 --> 17:39.809
I love you.

17:39.810 --> 17:42.145
And I just think if
we talked this out

17:42.146 --> 17:44.105
that we can get
somewhere and fix it.

17:44.106 --> 17:46.316
Look, Albert, you gotta go.

17:46.317 --> 17:49.861
I'm sure you're right for
somebody else, just not for me.

17:49.862 --> 17:51.488
Okay?

17:51.489 --> 17:52.655
Good night.

17:52.656 --> 17:55.275
Wait, let me just touch you.

18:03.417 --> 18:06.744
You're being a fucking jerk!

18:07.838 --> 18:11.124
Okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

18:11.467 --> 18:14.135
You know what?
I heard you fart once.

18:14.136 --> 18:16.346
And it went...

18:16.347 --> 18:19.683
And it was a sharp one.

18:19.684 --> 18:21.935
A little sharpie poop-toot.

18:21.936 --> 18:23.561
And I heard...

18:30.986 --> 18:33.613
You know what I'm gonna
get with this gold, Plugger?

18:33.614 --> 18:34.864
You know what I'm gonna get you?

18:34.865 --> 18:38.827
I'm gonna get you a big old
stack of fresh-cut steaks.

18:38.828 --> 18:40.161
I bet you'd like that.

18:41.414 --> 18:42.872
What? What's the matter with...

18:42.873 --> 18:44.082
Settle down, boy.

18:45.209 --> 18:47.711
Come on, boy, hey!
Quiet down, Plugger!

18:47.712 --> 18:50.914
Whoa, mule!

19:02.018 --> 19:03.101
Howdy, folks.

19:03.102 --> 19:04.185
Howdy.

19:04.186 --> 19:06.229
What can I do for you fellas?

19:06.230 --> 19:08.440
Well, we're riding through
to Sherman Creek.

19:08.441 --> 19:11.526
Be obliged if you could
tell us the shortest route.

19:11.527 --> 19:14.863
Oh, yeah, I can help you with that.

19:14.864 --> 19:17.073
I got a map right here.

19:17.074 --> 19:18.241
Yes, sir.

19:18.242 --> 19:20.076
Oh.

19:20.077 --> 19:22.954
You're on the main road now.

19:22.955 --> 19:26.166
And the main road goes
right through Bullhead

19:26.167 --> 19:28.793
and straight through
to Sherman Creek.

19:28.794 --> 19:31.212
But if you want the quickest way,

19:31.213 --> 19:33.423
I'd take Bilbee Pass.

19:33.424 --> 19:37.469
Safer, too. Less chance
of bandits and such.

19:37.470 --> 19:38.720
Thank you.

19:38.721 --> 19:41.297
- You can keep that.
- Oh.

19:42.725 --> 19:45.477
Uh, one more thing
you might do for us.

19:45.478 --> 19:46.603
What's that?

19:46.604 --> 19:49.806
You could show us the gold.

19:50.149 --> 19:52.108
Gold?

19:52.109 --> 19:54.486
I ain't got no gold.

19:54.487 --> 19:56.237
I wish.

19:56.238 --> 20:00.992
Been prospecting up there, but
that stream's about panned out.

20:00.993 --> 20:03.661
Old Plugger and I done give it up.

20:03.662 --> 20:06.039
We're going on back into town.

20:06.040 --> 20:10.043
Aye. You see, that's...
That's just it.

20:10.044 --> 20:12.921
You're heading back to town
in the middle of the day.

20:12.922 --> 20:17.333
A prospector only does that
when he's found gold to sell.

20:17.510 --> 20:18.843
Show it to me.

20:18.844 --> 20:21.054
No, I swear to you, mister.

20:21.055 --> 20:23.306
I ain't got no gold.

20:23.307 --> 20:27.310
We're just going into
town to get some...

20:27.311 --> 20:29.479
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

20:29.480 --> 20:33.400
- Hold on, let me think here a minute.
- You do that.

20:33.401 --> 20:37.395
I might just have a
little bit of gold.

20:38.239 --> 20:40.990
Yeah, here it is.
I forgot all about it.

20:40.991 --> 20:43.243
Here, take it.

20:43.244 --> 20:45.737
Pick up your gun.

20:45.830 --> 20:46.913
What?

20:46.914 --> 20:50.500
Well, I'm not just gonna take
your gold. That'd be stealing.

20:50.501 --> 20:53.503
You know what, old timer?
We'll shoot for it.

20:53.504 --> 20:55.046
- Clinch.
- Shut up.

20:55.047 --> 20:57.424
You just take the gold, okay?

20:57.425 --> 20:59.843
Only a thief would do that.

20:59.844 --> 21:01.886
Are you calling me a
thief, old timer?

21:01.887 --> 21:03.263
No, no, no!

21:03.264 --> 21:06.758
Then pick up your gun.

21:12.023 --> 21:13.690
That's it.

21:13.691 --> 21:16.226
Now point it at me.

21:24.035 --> 21:26.828
We shoot on three.

21:29.123 --> 21:31.407
One.

21:32.001 --> 21:34.244
Two.

21:36.213 --> 21:38.173
God damn it, Clinch!

21:38.174 --> 21:39.549
You didn't have to shoot him!

21:39.550 --> 21:41.092
I know I didn't have
to, sweetheart.

21:41.093 --> 21:43.636
He would've given you the gold!

21:43.637 --> 21:46.973
The point is I had
to ask him twice.

21:46.974 --> 21:48.641
I'm a busy man with a schedule.

21:48.642 --> 21:50.435
You're a son of a bitch
is what you are.

21:51.771 --> 21:55.106
Don't you ever say that
to me in front of my men.

21:55.107 --> 21:57.275
A man's wife will respect him.

21:57.276 --> 22:00.979
Now, let's try that again.

22:01.322 --> 22:02.572
Oh, my God, I love you.

22:02.573 --> 22:05.575
I'm, like, the luckiest girl
ever in the history of girls.

22:05.576 --> 22:10.113
That's it. Now, mount up.

22:11.415 --> 22:13.950
Hey, Clinch.

22:14.085 --> 22:15.752
Take a look.

22:15.753 --> 22:18.254
You'd lose half a day
going through Bullhead.

22:18.255 --> 22:21.257
You, Enoch and Jordy
will ride with me.

22:21.258 --> 22:24.427
We'll take Bilbee Pass
to Sherman Creek Trail.

22:24.428 --> 22:26.596
And make no mistake about the
kind of heat we're going to draw

22:26.597 --> 22:28.431
after we take that stage.

22:28.432 --> 22:31.184
Anna, I'm gonna keep
you out of harm's way.

22:31.185 --> 22:33.603
Lewis, you take Anna and ride east

22:33.604 --> 22:36.356
and hole up here in, uh, Old Stump.

22:36.357 --> 22:37.440
You got that?

22:37.441 --> 22:39.192
We'll let things cool

22:39.193 --> 22:42.979
for a wee bit and then we'll
come for you in 12 days.

22:52.957 --> 22:55.241
Come on, boy.

22:55.710 --> 22:58.378
Come on, Plugger. Come on! Yeah!

22:58.379 --> 23:00.130
Good boy! Let's go!

23:00.131 --> 23:02.999
Oh, Jesus Christ!

23:13.352 --> 23:16.521
Well, look who's up at
2:00 in the afternoon.

23:17.982 --> 23:22.352
There's still some pig ass and
sweet cream there if you want it.

23:24.530 --> 23:26.740
I'm gonna use the outhouse. Um...

23:26.741 --> 23:29.993
If I die out there, will you
guys just do me one favor?

23:29.994 --> 23:32.912
Just once, I want you
to switch seats.

23:32.913 --> 23:34.080
Fuck off.

23:34.081 --> 23:36.333
Okay.

23:36.334 --> 23:37.542
Oh.

23:37.543 --> 23:40.086
Ah, Edward, hey. What's going on?

23:40.087 --> 23:43.214
Oh, my God. Albert,
you look terrible!

23:43.215 --> 23:45.592
Oh, wow, there's that
confidence boost I need.

23:45.593 --> 23:47.344
Thanks a lot. How you doing, buddy?

23:47.345 --> 23:49.262
Well, honestly, I'm a
little worried about you.

23:49.263 --> 23:51.181
I haven't seen you in
town in a week and a half

23:51.182 --> 23:54.517
and, you know, it seems like you're
just staying in and sleeping all day.

23:54.518 --> 23:58.104
No, I don't stay home
all day. I go out.

23:58.105 --> 23:59.356
You know what I did on Tuesday?

23:59.357 --> 24:01.191
I went out to Charlie
Blanche's ranch

24:01.192 --> 24:02.359
and I paid him the money I owe him

24:02.360 --> 24:04.110
so he won't shoot me
in the fucking face.

24:04.111 --> 24:05.445
I did that. That's going out.

24:05.446 --> 24:07.238
Well, that's not really
what I'm talking about.

24:07.239 --> 24:08.907
Okay, look. Here's the
truth, all right?

24:08.908 --> 24:11.117
I just feel like I need to
stay here with my parents.

24:11.118 --> 24:13.161
They're not gonna be
around much longer

24:13.162 --> 24:16.539
and I just want to be able to give
back all the love and affection

24:16.540 --> 24:18.375
that I got growing up.

24:18.376 --> 24:19.626
You know? Right, guys?

24:19.627 --> 24:20.877
Ow!

24:20.878 --> 24:22.754
Oh, you getting the fart
needles again, Dad?

24:22.755 --> 24:24.506
Never mind what I'm getting!

24:24.507 --> 24:27.884
I love him so much!

24:27.885 --> 24:31.137
Albert, I know you're taking this
breakup really hard, and I understand,

24:31.138 --> 24:32.722
but you got to get
out of this funk.

24:32.723 --> 24:35.767
I mean, you haven't shorn
your sheep in weeks.

24:39.063 --> 24:40.772
Look, you don't know what
this is like, all right.

24:40.773 --> 24:43.316
With all due respect, you have no
fucking clue what this is like.

24:43.317 --> 24:45.026
All right? You're going
home every night

24:45.027 --> 24:46.653
to your girlfriend who loves you.

24:46.654 --> 24:48.947
- You're having sex with her, and you...
- Ah...

24:48.948 --> 24:53.743
No, Ruth and I have...
We've never done that.

24:53.744 --> 24:55.954
What do you mean you've...

24:55.955 --> 24:58.415
You've never had sex with Ruth?

24:58.416 --> 25:01.751
Yeah. No, no. Yeah.

25:01.752 --> 25:05.463
Wait, doesn't she have sex with, like,
10 guys every day at the whorehouse?

25:05.464 --> 25:07.757
On a slow day, yeah.

25:07.758 --> 25:09.259
But you guys have never had sex?

25:09.260 --> 25:12.929
No. No, Ruth wants to wait
until we get married.

25:12.930 --> 25:15.432
You know, she's a
Christian and so am I,

25:15.433 --> 25:19.394
and we want to save ourselves
for our wedding night.

25:19.395 --> 25:21.896
Edward, have you... Have you
ever had sex with anyone?

25:21.897 --> 25:23.815
Well, there was some shit with
my uncle, but that was...

25:23.816 --> 25:27.944
You know, it's really hard
to remember all that stuff.

25:27.945 --> 25:29.320
You know, yeah, you're right.

25:29.321 --> 25:30.405
Things could be a lot worse.

25:30.406 --> 25:31.489
Yeah.

25:31.490 --> 25:34.200
Um, I'll get out, I'll meet
some people. Yeah, thanks.

25:34.201 --> 25:35.577
Okay.

25:35.578 --> 25:39.614
Ow! That came out of my penis!

25:41.584 --> 25:44.169
Man, I see kids everywhere
with those stick hoops lately.

25:44.170 --> 25:46.254
I know. Me, too.

25:46.255 --> 25:47.839
It's got to be bad for
their brains, right?

25:47.840 --> 25:49.466
Yeah, it stunts their
attention span.

25:49.467 --> 25:50.717
I read an article in the paper.

25:50.718 --> 25:53.219
Yeah, I saw that. It's like
they lose the power to innovate

25:53.220 --> 25:54.888
because they're staring at
the stick hoop all day.

25:54.889 --> 25:56.097
Yep.

25:56.098 --> 25:58.558
Oh, by the way, they're delivering
the town's ice shipment today.

25:58.559 --> 25:59.726
You want to go watch?

25:59.727 --> 26:01.227
- Oh, yeah, that'd be fun.
- Yeah!

26:01.228 --> 26:03.396
Yeah. It's always a thrill
when you get to see

26:03.397 --> 26:05.148
that much ice all in one place.

26:05.149 --> 26:06.816
Yeah, I think so, too.
I'm really excited.

26:06.817 --> 26:09.561
Edward, Edward, look, look.

26:13.032 --> 26:15.400
Holy shit.

26:16.118 --> 26:17.160
Fucking Foy.

26:17.161 --> 26:19.120
She told me she didn't
want to see anybody.

26:19.121 --> 26:21.081
She told me she had
to work on herself.

26:21.082 --> 26:22.540
Look at that.

26:22.541 --> 26:24.376
Oh, my God. Fucking Foy!

26:24.377 --> 26:25.960
The owner of the Moustachery.

26:25.961 --> 26:27.796
Oh, look at that. He's kissing her.

26:27.797 --> 26:29.464
- He's frenching her.
- Fucking Foy!

26:29.465 --> 26:31.132
Maybe you should grow a moustache.

26:31.133 --> 26:32.717
No, I can't afford it.

26:32.718 --> 26:35.220
The creams, the waxes, the lotions.

26:35.221 --> 26:36.596
I don't have the money.

26:36.597 --> 26:37.681
Fucking Foy!

26:37.682 --> 26:39.599
Hey, Albert, maybe we
should just go to church.

26:39.600 --> 26:40.975
It'll make you feel a lot better.

26:40.976 --> 26:42.018
Church is not gonna...

26:42.019 --> 26:44.804
Oh, hey, look! It's the ice!

26:46.524 --> 26:47.941
Why is it so big?

26:47.942 --> 26:49.526
So it doesn't melt.

26:49.527 --> 26:50.610
Oh.

26:50.611 --> 26:52.195
That's so neat.

26:52.196 --> 26:53.822
I know. It's actually really
interesting how they do it.

26:53.823 --> 26:56.324
It's this one company out in Boston

26:56.325 --> 26:58.993
that basically cuts
it in big blocks

26:58.994 --> 27:02.539
from frozen lakes and ponds,
and they just ship it all over the...

27:02.540 --> 27:03.790
Oh! Oh...

27:03.791 --> 27:06.209
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

27:06.210 --> 27:08.920
That went south so fast!

27:08.921 --> 27:12.165
Oh! Oh!

27:12.883 --> 27:15.802
And make no mistake, my children.

27:15.803 --> 27:20.974
There shall be swift and righteous
justice on all free grazers.

27:20.975 --> 27:23.727
No more shall they nibble wantonly

27:23.728 --> 27:25.603
at the teat of our coffers.

27:25.604 --> 27:28.440
And that's just exactly
like that part in the Bible

27:28.441 --> 27:30.692
that applies to that situation.

27:30.693 --> 27:34.112
I would also like to
offer a heartfelt prayer

27:34.113 --> 27:36.239
to the family of James Addison,

27:36.240 --> 27:38.158
who was killed this morning

27:38.159 --> 27:39.826
while unloading the ice shipment.

27:39.827 --> 27:43.038
James, we will think of
you lovingly this July

27:43.039 --> 27:45.582
as we sip the cold summer beverages

27:45.583 --> 27:47.292
for which you gave your life.

27:47.293 --> 27:49.627
They're still gonna
use the fucking ice.

27:49.628 --> 27:51.755
Now, before we end this
morning's service,

27:51.756 --> 27:55.633
I would like to welcome two
new members to our community.

27:55.634 --> 27:58.595
Lewis Barnes and his sister, Anna.

27:58.596 --> 28:00.472
They've just moved
here to Old Stump

28:00.473 --> 28:02.432
and they plan to build a farm.

28:02.433 --> 28:04.351
And we wish them all the luck.

28:04.352 --> 28:06.811
Well, that concludes
today's service.

28:06.812 --> 28:08.772
So, may God bless you
for another week

28:08.773 --> 28:11.441
and there is a mountain
lion warning in effect.

28:26.290 --> 28:27.374
Hi.

28:27.375 --> 28:28.792
Hey, you.

28:28.793 --> 28:30.460
- So, the fair's coming up...
- Mmm?

28:30.461 --> 28:34.297
and I was thinking that we
could go dress shopping later.

28:34.298 --> 28:36.424
I was thinking you
need a new dress.

28:36.425 --> 28:38.301
Something expensive?

28:38.302 --> 28:39.969
Stupidly expensive!

28:39.970 --> 28:42.547
Okay.

28:52.233 --> 28:53.566
Oh, Jesus. Wow.

28:53.567 --> 28:55.819
Hi, Albert.

28:55.820 --> 28:57.570
Hello.

28:57.571 --> 29:01.065
What's up, kiddo? Never
seen you in here before.

29:01.492 --> 29:03.201
Just browsing.

29:03.202 --> 29:04.869
Yeah.

29:04.870 --> 29:07.497
You don't have a moustache, though.

29:07.498 --> 29:10.500
No, I know. I was thinking
about growing one.

29:10.501 --> 29:11.584
I'm sorry, I can't...

29:11.585 --> 29:14.170
- I said I was thinking about growing one.
- Oh.

29:14.171 --> 29:17.507
Excuse me, I have to
use the powder room.

29:17.508 --> 29:21.886
And just what kind of moustache
are you looking to grow?

29:21.887 --> 29:24.514
Um, a big one.

29:24.515 --> 29:26.516
Like one of those
ones that goes down

29:26.517 --> 29:28.560
along the side of my mouth,

29:28.561 --> 29:31.980
and then goes up the
edge of my jaw,

29:31.981 --> 29:35.525
and then becomes my sideburns,

29:35.526 --> 29:38.486
and then becomes my hair.

29:38.487 --> 29:39.654
A Möbius moustache.

29:39.655 --> 29:42.490
Möbius moustache, that's the one.

29:42.491 --> 29:44.701
Yeah. Um...

29:44.702 --> 29:46.619
You should know that
kind of moustache

29:46.620 --> 29:49.831
is a very costly facial accessory.

29:49.832 --> 29:50.999
Yeah, I know that.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.418
Well, you're a sheep farmer.

29:55.629 --> 29:57.881
Let me ask you something. You feel
good about what you're doing?

29:57.882 --> 29:59.090
What exactly am I doing?

29:59.091 --> 30:00.925
Stealing a guy's girlfriend.
That's what you're doing.

30:00.926 --> 30:02.052
You feel good about that?

30:02.053 --> 30:04.054
Hey, Louise dumped you, my friend.

30:04.055 --> 30:07.057
It's not my fault she wanted
someone with more to offer.

30:07.058 --> 30:09.351
I can give her a lavish home.

30:09.352 --> 30:12.896
Warm blankets, wrapped candies.

30:12.897 --> 30:14.856
Can you say the same, Albert?

30:14.857 --> 30:18.360
Can you give Louise
wrapped candies?

30:18.361 --> 30:19.944
You know what? Fuck you, man.

30:19.945 --> 30:23.782
Yeah, that's what she's doing.

30:53.062 --> 30:54.270
Oh, hey, sweetie.

30:54.271 --> 30:55.438
Hi!

30:55.439 --> 30:57.107
- Hi, Mark.
- Hey, Ed.

30:57.108 --> 30:59.609
Wow! What a long day!

30:59.610 --> 31:00.819
Oh, what happened?

31:00.820 --> 31:05.365
Oh, gosh! Well, like, this one
man wanted me to smoke a cigar

31:05.366 --> 31:08.702
and then ash on his balls
while I'm jerking him off,

31:08.703 --> 31:11.788
and I'm like, "What?
Can I do all that?"

31:13.374 --> 31:15.709
Yeah.

31:15.710 --> 31:18.128
You know, uh, Ruth,
I've been thinking.

31:18.129 --> 31:20.496
About what?

31:20.631 --> 31:22.132
Well, I love you.

31:22.133 --> 31:24.050
Well, I love you, too.

31:24.051 --> 31:27.470
And we've been together
for a long time.

31:27.471 --> 31:28.596
Wh...

31:28.597 --> 31:33.893
What do you think about us
spending the night together?

31:33.894 --> 31:37.147
You mean having sex?

31:37.148 --> 31:38.898
Maybe not right away, you know?

31:38.899 --> 31:41.109
We could maybe lie together
for the first couple of times

31:41.110 --> 31:42.736
and see how it feels,
and then go from there.

31:42.737 --> 31:44.404
But, Eddie, we're Christians.

31:44.405 --> 31:45.989
I know we're Christians

31:45.990 --> 31:49.325
and I want to do the correct
thing in the eyes of the Lord.

31:49.326 --> 31:52.328
But if we really do
love each other,

31:52.329 --> 31:54.581
don't you think God
would be okay with it?

31:54.582 --> 31:57.000
I don't know.

31:57.001 --> 32:00.170
I mean, you're talking about
pre-marital relations.

32:00.171 --> 32:03.673
Oh! You've got a little thing
right here. I'll get it.

32:03.674 --> 32:06.468
Oops. Oopsie.

32:06.469 --> 32:08.511
- Thank you.
- Oh.

32:08.512 --> 32:09.637
That's it, I'm out.

32:09.638 --> 32:10.930
What?

32:10.931 --> 32:14.142
I'm done. I'm leaving.
I'm going to San Francisco.

32:14.143 --> 32:16.144
What, are you serious?
Because of Louise?

32:16.145 --> 32:19.856
Yes, I'm serious. And, yes,
it is because of Louise.

32:19.857 --> 32:21.191
I don't know how I
lasted this long.

32:21.192 --> 32:23.151
I hate the frontier,
I hate everything in it.

32:23.152 --> 32:26.154
Well, what am I gonna do?
I'm your best friend.

32:26.155 --> 32:30.992
I know. That's... That's why
I want you to have these.

32:30.993 --> 32:33.244
Albert, these are
your favorite socks.

32:33.245 --> 32:35.697
Yeah.

32:35.706 --> 32:38.741
And I want you to have that.

32:41.587 --> 32:43.213
Edward, this is your
lucky handkerchief.

32:43.214 --> 32:44.589
Yeah.

32:44.590 --> 32:47.834
It's sticky.

32:48.427 --> 32:51.179
Well, hello to you, too!

32:51.180 --> 32:53.890
James, I found the friendly locals.

32:53.891 --> 32:57.811
So he said, "Why don't you
go blow your own horse?"

32:59.063 --> 33:01.356
Hey, watch it, pal.

33:01.357 --> 33:03.566
I think you owe me a drink, fella.

33:03.567 --> 33:05.402
The hell I do.

33:05.403 --> 33:07.320
You best watch where you stand.

33:07.321 --> 33:10.281
I don't think you heard me.

33:10.282 --> 33:12.242
I'm thirsty.

33:12.243 --> 33:17.113
Then why don't you go on down
the river and take a dunk?

33:17.415 --> 33:20.074
Last chance, kid.

33:44.108 --> 33:45.483
Oh, shit!

33:49.113 --> 33:52.365
Albert, hurry! Get in position!

33:59.623 --> 34:01.666
We got our own thing
going on over here.

34:01.667 --> 34:03.293
Yeah, nobody needs
to get in on this.

34:03.294 --> 34:05.420
We're both getting
hurt pretty badly.

34:09.967 --> 34:11.760
Nobody needs to come over here.

34:11.761 --> 34:14.054
This fight is way more
violent than yours...

34:14.054 --> 34:16.473
All those other guys' fights.

34:27.985 --> 34:30.152
Oh!

34:30.154 --> 34:31.487
You actually hit me!

34:31.489 --> 34:32.614
I'm so sorry.

34:32.614 --> 34:33.697
You fucker!

34:33.699 --> 34:35.033
I put a new move in there.

34:35.034 --> 34:36.409
You don't just put a new move in.

34:36.409 --> 34:38.860
That's why we have the meetings.

34:45.503 --> 34:47.337
That's where it hurts.
Like, right there.

34:47.338 --> 34:48.713
Like, right underneath my eye.

34:48.714 --> 34:50.005
Yeah, there's a little red spot.

34:50.007 --> 34:51.757
Ow! Careful, it's tender.

35:12.697 --> 35:14.864
- Thank you.
- Sure.

35:17.410 --> 35:19.777
Shit. Come on.

35:21.288 --> 35:22.414
Whoa!

35:23.541 --> 35:25.083
Sorry about that.

35:25.084 --> 35:27.127
It's kind of a regular
occurrence around here.

35:27.128 --> 35:29.212
- Really?
- Yeah.

35:30.381 --> 35:33.550
Hey, pretty fast hands back there.

35:33.551 --> 35:35.760
- Oh...
- I guess you're a real hero.

35:35.761 --> 35:39.514
Me? No, I'm not the hero.

35:39.515 --> 35:42.142
I'm the guy in the crowd making
fun of the hero's shirt.

35:42.143 --> 35:43.601
- That's who I am.
- Oh.

35:43.602 --> 35:47.188
- Hey, look who's here.
- Who's this?

35:47.189 --> 35:48.356
This is Plugger.

35:48.357 --> 35:50.934
Hey, Plugger.

35:51.485 --> 35:54.446
So, that... That was your
brother in there, huh?

35:54.447 --> 35:57.907
Yeah, Lewis. He's always
been a little rambunctious.

35:57.908 --> 36:01.494
Yeah, he seems like a great guy.
I'm Albert, by the way.

36:01.495 --> 36:03.204
Anna.

36:03.205 --> 36:04.622
You guys just got into town?

36:04.623 --> 36:06.166
Yeah.

36:06.167 --> 36:08.251
Welcome to our awesome town.

36:08.252 --> 36:09.586
Thanks.

36:09.587 --> 36:11.963
Lewis and I just came
out from Kansas City.

36:11.964 --> 36:13.465
Oh, Kansas.

36:13.466 --> 36:15.258
No, it's in Missouri.

36:15.259 --> 36:17.761
Oh, right. That's
annoying and weird.

36:17.762 --> 36:18.928
We were wanting a change,

36:18.929 --> 36:21.890
so we came out to the frontier
looking to build a farm.

36:21.891 --> 36:23.391
- Oh, that's what I do.
- Really?

36:23.392 --> 36:25.602
Yeah, I got a farm about
2 miles from here.

36:25.603 --> 36:26.895
Oh, cattle?

36:26.896 --> 36:28.521
Uh, no, sheep.

36:28.522 --> 36:30.106
- Oh.
- Yep.

36:30.107 --> 36:32.734
Well, that's got to be
fulfilling work, though, right?

36:32.735 --> 36:33.943
Ah, yeah, it's great.

36:33.944 --> 36:37.489
It's like being a dog walker
for 150 really stupid dogs.

36:38.824 --> 36:40.575
- Oh, shit, Plugger!
- Oh, my God!

36:40.576 --> 36:42.577
- Plugger, give it to me.
- Jesus, what is that?

36:42.578 --> 36:44.662
It's the mayor.

36:46.165 --> 36:49.158
Oh, shit!

36:49.794 --> 36:52.379
So, how did you guys meet?

36:52.380 --> 36:55.131
Uh, she moved to town
a couple years ago

36:55.132 --> 36:58.134
to take over the schoolmarm job.

36:58.135 --> 37:02.681
Our old schoolmarm got her throat
slit by a fast-moving tumbleweed.

37:02.682 --> 37:04.474
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah.

37:04.475 --> 37:05.767
In front of the kids?

37:05.768 --> 37:08.103
Oh, yeah. Yeah. All of them.

37:08.104 --> 37:09.312
Let me help you.

37:09.313 --> 37:13.182
That is just painful to watch.

37:14.443 --> 37:18.863
And, you know, it's like the
whole time we were together

37:18.864 --> 37:21.741
I just remember thinking,

37:21.742 --> 37:25.695
"How can I possibly be this happy?

37:25.705 --> 37:26.788
"She likes me now,

37:26.789 --> 37:28.748
"but one day, she
is gonna figure out

37:28.749 --> 37:31.534
"that she is too good for me."

37:31.919 --> 37:36.414
And then one day, she did.

37:36.841 --> 37:42.795
I feel like I finally tricked one
girl into falling in love with me

37:43.055 --> 37:45.849
and then I lost her.

37:45.850 --> 37:49.594
I think you have this
whole thing upside down.

37:49.603 --> 37:52.188
I mean, it sounds like you've bent
over backwards for this girl,

37:52.189 --> 37:53.732
but what has she given you back?

37:53.733 --> 37:56.359
I told you, she allowed
me to be happy

37:56.360 --> 37:58.695
in a part of the world that
is otherwise a living hell.

37:58.696 --> 38:00.613
"Allowed"? Wow.

38:00.614 --> 38:02.615
That's kind of fucked up that
you would use that word.

38:02.616 --> 38:04.909
You know that, right?

38:04.910 --> 38:08.621
All I know is that there
is nothing for me out here

38:08.622 --> 38:11.115
if I don't have her.

38:11.625 --> 38:13.418
Well,

38:13.419 --> 38:16.296
if this Foy guy is
that much of a douche,

38:16.297 --> 38:19.591
she'll figure it out
if she's smart.

38:19.592 --> 38:22.218
Sometimes a girl has to get a
few assholes out of her system

38:22.219 --> 38:24.721
before she realizes what
a good guy looks like.

38:24.722 --> 38:27.090
Mmm. Maybe.

38:30.895 --> 38:32.854
- Ah!
- You okay?

38:32.855 --> 38:36.066
This is actually my
first cigarette ever.

38:36.067 --> 38:39.352
Oh, my God.

38:42.656 --> 38:44.407
- Oh, shit.
- Diamondback.

38:44.408 --> 38:46.159
- It's a diamondback, yeah.
- Fuck.

38:46.160 --> 38:48.912
It's okay, just hold perfectly
still, and it'll go away.

38:48.913 --> 38:51.489
Okay, okay.

38:53.751 --> 38:56.795
I don't think you
should leave tomorrow.

38:56.796 --> 38:58.755
At least stay through the weekend.

38:58.756 --> 39:00.423
Isn't the fair on Saturday?

39:00.424 --> 39:03.718
Oh, fuck that. I'm not
going to the stupid fair.

39:03.719 --> 39:05.970
Louise is gonna be there,
and she's gonna be with Foy.

39:05.971 --> 39:07.305
I don't want to put myself through

39:07.306 --> 39:08.765
that kind of fucking aggravation.

39:08.766 --> 39:11.059
Yeah, well, I'll go with you.

39:11.060 --> 39:13.478
No better way to make your
ex-girlfriend want you back more

39:13.479 --> 39:15.814
than to let her see you
with another girl.

39:15.815 --> 39:17.023
I don't know.

39:17.024 --> 39:19.776
Especially a smoking-hot girl.

39:19.777 --> 39:23.238
When she sees me, she'll
be intimidated as fuck.

39:23.239 --> 39:25.115
Oh, you're very modest, I see.

39:25.116 --> 39:28.076
I'm a little cocky.
But I got great tits.

39:29.620 --> 39:31.454
- Oh!
- Sorry. Sorry, sir.

39:31.455 --> 39:34.866
Sorry, sir. Sorry, sir.

39:57.273 --> 40:01.226
Barnes, wake up.
Brought you a visitor.

40:02.945 --> 40:05.280
You stupid son of a bitch.

40:05.281 --> 40:07.365
You shot the pastor's son.

40:07.366 --> 40:09.284
You realize they're probably
gonna hang you for this?

40:09.285 --> 40:12.904
Who gives a fuck what they want?

40:13.622 --> 40:16.833
When Clinch gets into town, it's
not gonna matter what they do.

40:16.834 --> 40:18.043
He'll bust me out

40:18.044 --> 40:21.871
and anyone who tries to stop
him is gonna be a dead man.

40:25.509 --> 40:28.511
You know, one of these days

40:28.512 --> 40:31.514
there's gonna be a man
who's faster than Clinch

40:31.515 --> 40:34.851
and tougher, and stronger.

40:34.852 --> 40:37.979
And then Clinch is
gonna be the dead man.

40:37.980 --> 40:40.690
And I'm gonna smoke a
fucking cigar to celebrate.

40:40.691 --> 40:45.028
I don't think Clinch would like
you talking about him that way.

40:45.029 --> 40:48.281
Not a nice thing for a man's
wife to say about her husband.

40:48.282 --> 40:50.450
Yeah, well,

40:50.451 --> 40:54.904
let's see if he gets here before you
find yourself at the end of a rope.

40:56.374 --> 40:58.616
Tick-tock.

41:21.816 --> 41:23.274
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no, no!

41:23.275 --> 41:24.567
Guys, no, no, no.

41:24.568 --> 41:27.237
Andrew, Jonathan, no.
Go, go, go. Go home.

41:30.241 --> 41:32.242
Hey, sheep boy.

41:32.243 --> 41:33.910
Hey.

41:33.911 --> 41:37.914
Jesus, are you okay? I heard about
your brother getting arrested.

41:37.915 --> 41:41.084
Yeah, I'm fine. And listen, Albert.

41:41.085 --> 41:43.086
Don't worry about Lewis, okay?

41:43.087 --> 41:46.423
Anything that happens to him right
now is his own fault. Got it?

41:46.424 --> 41:48.216
Yeah. Whatever you say, sure.

41:48.217 --> 41:51.386
Good. Let's hit this fair, because
you know what I wanna do?

41:51.387 --> 41:53.263
Eat hot food in 100-degree weather?

41:53.264 --> 41:56.016
No, get my picture taken.
I've never done it before.

41:56.017 --> 41:57.767
- That's horse shit.
- No, it's the truth.

41:57.768 --> 41:59.769
- No, that's horse shit.
- Whoa! Oh, that is horse shit.

41:59.770 --> 42:03.223
Okay. All right.

42:27.715 --> 42:30.833
Okay, everybody hold still!

42:31.260 --> 42:33.136
You know, supposedly,
there's some guy in Texas

42:33.137 --> 42:35.430
who smiled one time while he
was getting his picture taken.

42:35.431 --> 42:37.140
Shut the fuck up. Are you serious?

42:37.141 --> 42:39.225
We were just talking about
that last week. Is that true?

42:39.226 --> 42:42.645
I don't know. I mean, I heard it
somewhere. I don't know if it's true.

42:42.646 --> 42:45.774
Yeah, it sounds like the kind of
bullshit somebody would make up.

42:45.775 --> 42:49.435
Okay. Everybody hold still.

42:54.075 --> 42:56.076
- Oh, my God!
- Holy shit!

42:58.662 --> 43:01.155
Hold still!

43:01.916 --> 43:03.833
God! This fucking fair!

43:03.834 --> 43:05.251
Every year, something
like this happens.

43:05.252 --> 43:06.419
Every year, people die.

43:06.420 --> 43:07.837
- Really?
- Every year.

43:07.838 --> 43:09.005
Last year, there
were two gunfights,

43:09.006 --> 43:11.007
there was a knife fight,
a stage collapsed,

43:11.008 --> 43:12.717
there was a drowning, and
the Indians attacked.

43:12.718 --> 43:15.387
- God, why are the Indians always so mad?
- I don't know.

43:15.388 --> 43:17.931
I mean, we're basically splitting
this country 50-50 with them.

43:17.932 --> 43:20.425
They're just selfish.

43:21.852 --> 43:23.770
Ladies and gentlemen!

43:23.771 --> 43:26.231
Step right up, step right up!

43:26.232 --> 43:27.524
Try a sample of...

43:27.525 --> 43:30.068
Sir and madam, may I
divert your attention

43:30.069 --> 43:31.820
over here just for a moment?

43:31.821 --> 43:35.532
Welcome, welcome. Can I
interest you in a miracle cure?

43:35.533 --> 43:38.159
I have only the finest
healing tonics and elixirs

43:38.160 --> 43:40.704
procured from the farthest
corners of the globe.

43:40.705 --> 43:43.415
"Ogden's Celebrated
Stomach Bitters."

43:43.416 --> 43:45.542
Can I just ask, celebrated by who?

43:45.543 --> 43:47.419
Who's celebrating about
stomach bitters?

43:47.420 --> 43:49.004
God. Look at the ingredients.

43:49.005 --> 43:52.340
"Cocaine, alcohol, morphine,
mercury with chalk."

43:52.341 --> 43:54.592
What the hell is
"mercury with chalk"?

43:54.593 --> 43:55.719
Science!

43:55.720 --> 43:57.429
And "red flannel."

43:57.430 --> 43:59.639
Red flannel? There's shirt in here?

43:59.640 --> 44:00.890
Pieces of shirt.

44:00.891 --> 44:02.809
Okay, thank you very much.

44:02.810 --> 44:04.394
Would you like to try?

44:04.395 --> 44:06.021
- Oh, my God.
- What?

44:06.022 --> 44:08.023
That's them. That's them.

44:08.024 --> 44:10.483
Quick, pretend you just
said something funny to me.

44:10.484 --> 44:13.361
Oh, my God! You are...
You are so hilarious!

44:13.362 --> 44:15.071
Where do you come up... No, shit!

44:15.072 --> 44:16.406
You pretend I said something funny.

44:16.407 --> 44:17.657
Albert, stop. Stop.

44:17.658 --> 44:18.908
Just introduce me. Come on.

44:18.909 --> 44:20.118
I'm not gonna introduce you...

44:20.119 --> 44:22.746
- Oh, hi!
- Hey.

44:22.747 --> 44:26.249
Uh, Foy and Louise, right?

44:26.250 --> 44:27.584
- Mmm-hmm.
- That's right.

44:27.585 --> 44:29.836
Uh, this is Anna. She's...

44:29.837 --> 44:32.047
- I'm his girlfriend.
- She's my girlfriend.

44:32.048 --> 44:34.924
- Mmm-hmm.
- She's the new GF. Big time.

44:34.925 --> 44:36.801
A lot of sexual activity.

44:36.802 --> 44:40.847
All the time. I live inside her.

44:40.848 --> 44:42.307
So, if you want to
send me a letter,

44:42.308 --> 44:46.436
you gotta address it
care of her vagina.

44:46.437 --> 44:48.063
Yep.

44:48.064 --> 44:49.105
I have that skirt.

44:49.106 --> 44:51.107
- Oh, you do?
- Mmm-hmm.

44:51.108 --> 44:53.234
Yeah, I wore it to the
fair, like, two years ago.

44:53.235 --> 44:55.403
But good for you for
trying to bring it back.

44:55.404 --> 44:57.655
Well, I figure only
a complete idiot

44:57.656 --> 45:00.533
would throw away a
perfectly good thing.

45:00.534 --> 45:02.744
We were gonna go check out the
shooting gallery over there.

45:02.745 --> 45:04.037
- You guys wanna join?
- What?

45:04.038 --> 45:05.538
Yeah, it'd be fun, right?

45:05.539 --> 45:07.916
Oh, yes, and let's make
things interesting.

45:07.917 --> 45:10.377
A nickel a target.

45:10.378 --> 45:13.380
You know, that's actually, uh,
a little rich for my blood.

45:13.381 --> 45:14.714
Uh, how about a penny?

45:14.715 --> 45:18.843
What's the matter, Albert?
Is business... bad?

45:21.430 --> 45:23.682
No, no. A penny it is.

45:23.683 --> 45:26.810
Good Lord, Albert, you're
such a "sheepskate." Oh!

45:26.811 --> 45:28.019
Wow!

45:28.020 --> 45:29.979
Oh...

45:29.980 --> 45:31.940
Let's go, Louise. You
can "shear" me on.

45:31.941 --> 45:33.983
Oh, no, I didn't!

45:33.984 --> 45:36.194
- You're so funny, baby.
- Thank you.

45:36.195 --> 45:37.362
Shall we?

45:37.363 --> 45:38.488
Come on.

45:38.489 --> 45:39.531
Wait, wait, no, no.

45:39.532 --> 45:40.865
There you are, my good man.

45:40.866 --> 45:42.659
Indeed.

45:42.660 --> 45:46.079
Oh, wow. That seems unnecessary.

45:46.080 --> 45:49.824
What's wrong with ducks
or rabbits or something?

45:52.962 --> 45:55.163
Mmm-hmm.

46:03.305 --> 46:06.099
Six shots, six hits.
Quite the marksman!

46:06.100 --> 46:07.434
There you go, ma'am.

46:07.435 --> 46:09.310
Thank you, baby.

46:12.440 --> 46:14.724
Care to try?

46:17.611 --> 46:20.321
You got it.

46:20.322 --> 46:23.149
Just breathe.

46:35.212 --> 46:38.131
Seems you owe me six
cents, sheep herder.

46:38.132 --> 46:39.632
Yeah, yeah, I know.

46:39.633 --> 46:41.760
Jesus.

46:41.761 --> 46:43.678
Wait. Hang on a sec.

46:43.679 --> 46:46.056
You wanna make this interesting?

46:46.057 --> 46:49.142
If I can shoot six out of six on
Albert's behalf, you owe him a dollar.

46:49.143 --> 46:51.019
If I can't,

46:51.020 --> 46:52.896
- he owes you a dollar.
- Wait, what?

46:52.897 --> 46:54.689
- A dollar?
- I've never seen a dollar.

46:54.690 --> 46:55.774
Nobody's got a dollar!

46:55.775 --> 46:56.900
Let us see the dollar!

46:56.901 --> 46:59.069
Well, this is interesting.

46:59.070 --> 47:03.073
All right. Do your best, ma'am.

47:05.284 --> 47:06.910
How fast can this thing go?

47:06.911 --> 47:10.538
Oh, you can play double or triple
speeds, but that's for the experts.

47:10.539 --> 47:12.740
As fast as you can.

47:23.094 --> 47:25.011
Holy shit!

47:25.012 --> 47:26.513
Congratulations!

47:26.514 --> 47:28.598
You're a winner!

47:28.599 --> 47:30.725
Thank you.

47:30.726 --> 47:33.595
Come on, you owe him a dollar.

47:37.274 --> 47:38.400
There it is!

47:38.401 --> 47:39.484
It's beautiful!

47:39.485 --> 47:42.729
Take your hat off, boy.
That's a dollar bill!

47:44.865 --> 47:48.451
Well, a man whose girlfriend
does his shooting for him.

47:48.452 --> 47:50.995
Isn't that a fine how-do-you-do?

47:53.708 --> 47:56.876
I said, "Isn't that a
fine how-do-you-do?"

48:00.506 --> 48:03.049
How is that funny?
What's funny about that?

48:03.050 --> 48:04.968
"How do you do" is a greeting.
Why is that funny?

48:04.969 --> 48:06.594
You, why are you laughing?

48:06.595 --> 48:10.340
I don't know. He was laughing.

48:10.474 --> 48:13.268
It seems your ex-boyfriend
doesn't have a sense of humor.

48:13.269 --> 48:14.811
I can see why you dumped him.

48:14.812 --> 48:16.563
Hey!

48:16.564 --> 48:18.356
You wanna back up that
attitude, asshole?

48:18.357 --> 48:19.607
Oh, you are kidding.

48:19.608 --> 48:22.277
Never been more serious in
my life. You and me, pistols.

48:22.278 --> 48:23.778
You wouldn't have a prayer, kiddo.

48:23.779 --> 48:25.530
Tomorrow, 8:00 a.m., sharp.

48:25.531 --> 48:27.365
All right, challenge accepted!

48:27.366 --> 48:29.367
Oh, gosh. Tomorrow is bad for me,

48:29.368 --> 48:31.161
and I really wanna be there.

48:31.162 --> 48:33.288
Why don't we say a week from today?

48:33.289 --> 48:35.498
That works for you, right, Albert?

48:35.499 --> 48:38.460
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
A week from today.

48:38.461 --> 48:41.921
I got sheep stuff I gotta
do tomorrow, anyway.

48:41.922 --> 48:43.631
One week.

48:43.632 --> 48:44.799
Come on, Louise.

48:44.800 --> 48:47.510
I'll buy you some sugared
butter shavings.

48:52.600 --> 48:54.559
Oh, shit!

48:54.560 --> 48:55.685
Wow.

48:55.686 --> 48:58.021
What the fuck did I just do?

48:58.022 --> 49:01.232
You just challenged
Foy to a gunfight.

49:01.233 --> 49:02.484
I have no idea what just happened.

49:02.485 --> 49:04.110
I was, like, out of my body.

49:04.111 --> 49:06.446
Albert, did you see the
look on Louise's face?

49:06.447 --> 49:07.572
No. Why?

49:07.573 --> 49:10.575
She was aroused. She was impressed.

49:10.576 --> 49:13.661
You had a fire in your belly
for a second there, pal.

49:13.662 --> 49:15.538
Bet you never showed
her that side before.

49:15.539 --> 49:17.374
Yeah, I don't have that side to me.

49:17.375 --> 49:19.084
I honestly don't know
what just happened.

49:19.085 --> 49:20.919
Albert, you got her attention.

49:20.920 --> 49:22.379
You beat this guy at a gunfight,

49:22.380 --> 49:24.547
I bet she thinks twice
about dumping you.

49:24.548 --> 49:26.216
Anna, I can't be in a gunfight.

49:26.217 --> 49:27.300
What am I, Clinch Leatherwood here?

49:27.301 --> 49:29.219
- I'll get killed!
- Whoa!

49:29.220 --> 49:31.346
Why would you say that?

49:31.347 --> 49:34.391
Because he's the most vicious
gunfighter in the territory,

49:34.392 --> 49:35.558
which I am not!

49:35.559 --> 49:38.520
No, you're not Clinch Leatherwood.

49:38.521 --> 49:40.063
You're gonna be okay, Albert.

49:40.064 --> 49:42.732
That week I just bought you is enough
time for me to teach you how to shoot.

49:42.733 --> 49:43.858
You'll be fine.

49:43.859 --> 49:45.151
Oh, yeah, by the way,
that's another thing.

49:45.152 --> 49:47.153
How the fuck can you
shoot like that?

49:47.154 --> 49:48.655
Who the hell are you?

49:48.656 --> 49:52.492
My father was a gun maker. I could
shoot a gun before I could walk.

49:52.493 --> 49:55.495
Whatever. I'm sick to my stomach.
My stomach is in knots.

49:55.496 --> 49:57.414
You're worked up, that's
what it is. Let's get a drink.

49:57.415 --> 49:58.581
Come on.

49:58.582 --> 50:00.959
Hey! It's our sweet young couple.

50:00.960 --> 50:04.954
Could I interest you folks
in some Wildroot Cream-Oil?

50:11.762 --> 50:12.846
People die at the fair.

50:12.847 --> 50:15.632
People die at the fair.

50:31.115 --> 50:33.742
Okay, so you're gonna
take your right thumb,

50:33.743 --> 50:35.243
put it all the way to the left.

50:35.244 --> 50:37.996
Cross it over, cradle
it right in there,

50:37.997 --> 50:39.497
and then just extend it
straight through your...

50:39.498 --> 50:41.082
- Like that?
- Straight.

50:41.083 --> 50:43.585
Wow, you've never
fired a gun before.

50:43.586 --> 50:45.420
I... I have not. I own a gun.

50:45.421 --> 50:47.213
No, I fired a gun at
the shooting gallery.

50:47.214 --> 50:49.341
Yeah, but those were quarter loads.
These are full loads.

50:49.342 --> 50:53.219
Okay, all right, get ready. I'm about
to shoot a full load at your cans.

50:53.220 --> 50:55.263
Shut the fuck up and focus.

50:55.264 --> 50:57.507
All right. Okay.

51:05.066 --> 51:06.149
This is never gonna work.

51:06.150 --> 51:07.984
- This is not working.
- It's gonna work.

51:07.985 --> 51:10.403
It's gonna work and Louise is
gonna come running back to you.

51:10.404 --> 51:12.005
How the hell do you
get these things out?

51:12.865 --> 51:15.867
I'm sitting there
jerking that thing off.

51:18.579 --> 51:20.622
Hey, why are you
being so nice to me?

51:20.623 --> 51:21.831
What do you mean?

51:21.832 --> 51:24.209
Well, I mean, you show
up out of nowhere.

51:24.210 --> 51:28.546
You're this complete anomaly in my
world of terribleness out here.

51:28.547 --> 51:31.424
I mean, you must have a million
better things to do than this.

51:31.425 --> 51:33.677
What, I can't make a new friend?

51:33.678 --> 51:35.845
You sure look like
you could use one.

51:35.846 --> 51:39.057
I guess. I mean, I just... I just
don't know anything about you.

51:39.058 --> 51:41.101
Well, can I ask you
something about you?

51:41.102 --> 51:43.386
Yeah, sure.

51:43.521 --> 51:46.264
Why do you love Louise?

51:46.774 --> 51:49.776
I mean, take your pick. She's...

51:49.777 --> 51:51.277
I feel great when I'm with her.

51:51.278 --> 51:55.240
She's classy, she's fun,
she's insanely gorgeous.

51:55.241 --> 51:58.118
Hey, no. Look, she's
really pretty, yes.

51:58.119 --> 51:59.869
But honestly, and I'm
sorry to say this,

51:59.870 --> 52:02.038
I don't see what else
she's got going for her.

52:02.039 --> 52:05.709
My impression was that she was a
little sour and self-absorbed.

52:05.710 --> 52:07.836
And for a guy with so
much going for him,

52:07.837 --> 52:09.087
I just thought that maybe you...

52:09.088 --> 52:11.464
I don't know what you think
I have going for me, but...

52:11.465 --> 52:12.966
You see? There you go again,

52:12.967 --> 52:14.217
just cutting yourself down.

52:14.218 --> 52:15.927
You act like this
girl was performing

52:15.928 --> 52:18.138
some kind of a charitable
act by dating you.

52:18.139 --> 52:19.514
Albert, you're a catch.

52:19.515 --> 52:21.975
You're sweet, you're
funny, you're smart.

52:21.976 --> 52:23.852
You've made something
of yourself out here.

52:23.853 --> 52:25.395
You know, a lot of
people can't say that.

52:25.396 --> 52:26.980
You're a good sheep farmer.

52:26.981 --> 52:29.566
Oh, my God, please.
I suck at sheep.

52:29.567 --> 52:31.109
Louise was right. I can't
keep track of them.

52:31.110 --> 52:32.902
There was a sheep in the
whorehouse last week.

52:32.903 --> 52:34.320
- Really?
- Yeah.

52:34.321 --> 52:36.322
Wandered in there, and then
when I went to pick it up,

52:36.323 --> 52:38.074
somehow, it had made $20.

52:41.620 --> 52:45.915
But, you know, thank you
anyway for what you said.

52:45.916 --> 52:48.835
Oh, look, the West fucking sucks,

52:48.836 --> 52:50.587
but the frontier is
not your problem.

52:50.588 --> 52:51.755
It's you.

52:51.756 --> 52:53.923
You need a little confidence
boost, my friend.

52:53.924 --> 52:56.459
Now, aim up, sheep boy.

53:05.311 --> 53:06.770
- Oh!
- Hey!

53:06.771 --> 53:08.188
- There we go!
- See? There!

53:08.189 --> 53:09.814
All righty. That's one.

53:09.815 --> 53:14.611
So, all I gotta do is get Foy to let
me shoot 16 times before he shoots

53:14.612 --> 53:15.862
and then I win!

53:15.863 --> 53:17.280
You're gonna do great, I promise.

53:17.281 --> 53:19.983
- Easy.
- We're gonna get there.

55:14.440 --> 55:16.066
- Hey!
- Yes!

55:18.027 --> 55:19.110
Oh!

55:19.111 --> 55:23.231
God damn it, Albert!
No more friends!

55:29.955 --> 55:31.748
You know, you did great today.

55:31.749 --> 55:33.750
So much better than last week.

55:33.751 --> 55:36.753
And I have a surprise for you.

55:36.754 --> 55:39.047
You have earned one of Anna Barnes'

55:39.048 --> 55:43.251
very special
super-super-secret cookies.

55:43.761 --> 55:46.096
Mmm-hmm.

55:46.097 --> 55:48.014
- Wait, what is this?
- Mmm-hmm?

55:48.015 --> 55:49.974
This is a pot... This is
a pot cookie, isn't it?

55:49.975 --> 55:51.309
- It's a pot cookie.
- No, no, no.

55:51.310 --> 55:52.435
No. I don't do well
with that stuff at all.

55:52.436 --> 55:53.520
It's a pot cookie.

55:53.521 --> 55:55.313
Yeah, I know. No, thank you.

55:55.314 --> 55:56.564
Just have a little bit with me.

55:56.565 --> 55:59.401
My worst fear is to OD
on a recreational drug.

55:59.402 --> 56:00.860
- No, thank you.
- On a pot cookie?

56:00.861 --> 56:02.487
The last time somebody
gave me one of these

56:02.488 --> 56:04.948
I became convinced that prairie
dogs could read my mind.

56:04.949 --> 56:06.866
Just take a little bit.

56:06.867 --> 56:08.702
- I'll take a very, very small bite.
- Just a small bite.

56:08.703 --> 56:11.905
- A very small bite.
- That's it.

56:13.249 --> 56:14.541
Are you kidding me?

56:14.542 --> 56:16.126
Nope. Deadly serious.

56:16.127 --> 56:17.794
Let's see what this does

56:17.795 --> 56:19.337
and if I don't throw
myself off this cliff

56:19.338 --> 56:20.839
during some awful
freak-out, then...

56:20.840 --> 56:22.507
Just take that little
bit, right there.

56:22.508 --> 56:24.551
Well, now you've touched it.

56:24.552 --> 56:28.888
Take the other side. There you go.

56:28.889 --> 56:31.141
There.

56:31.142 --> 56:34.886
And now, we just wait
for the sun to set.

56:45.698 --> 56:48.491
This is really weird.

56:48.492 --> 56:51.694
Is it supposed to be like this?

56:53.247 --> 56:54.456
You gave me the right
amount, right?

56:54.457 --> 56:58.284
You don't think I took too much?

56:59.462 --> 57:01.921
- Just ride it out.
- This is...

57:01.922 --> 57:04.299
Wow, my bones are in
really deep today.

57:04.300 --> 57:07.635
Like, there's a lot more
skin than there usually is.

57:07.636 --> 57:09.679
I think my body is padding
up for the winter,

57:09.680 --> 57:11.139
which is weird, because
it's not winter.

57:11.140 --> 57:12.390
But there's a lot more there.

57:13.893 --> 57:16.094
Oh...

57:18.064 --> 57:20.815
There's something wrong
with my swallowing.

57:20.816 --> 57:22.484
This is not how I usually swallow.

57:23.611 --> 57:24.778
Oh, my God, Anna, he knows.

57:24.779 --> 57:25.862
What, what, what?

57:25.863 --> 57:27.947
He knows what we're doing,
he knows what this is.

57:27.948 --> 57:29.324
He knows what this is.

57:29.325 --> 57:32.285
I don't wanna... No,
I don't wanna join.

57:32.286 --> 57:35.738
I don't wanna join up.

57:50.721 --> 57:52.847
Suppertime, you lazy prick.

57:57.228 --> 57:59.854
Goddamn waste of lungs.

58:07.238 --> 58:10.273
Who's lazy now, Sheriff?

58:55.453 --> 58:57.654
Hey.

59:01.917 --> 59:03.418
Wow.

59:03.419 --> 59:05.628
You look amazing.

59:05.629 --> 59:07.630
And maybe a little uncomfortable.

59:07.631 --> 59:09.758
Oh, shit!

59:09.759 --> 59:11.593
I'm totally overdressed, aren't I?

59:11.594 --> 59:12.927
No.

59:12.928 --> 59:14.971
I've never done formal before.

59:14.972 --> 59:17.307
And the lady at the boutique
told me to buy this

59:17.308 --> 59:18.725
and no one else is wearing this.

59:18.726 --> 59:20.143
Who cares what...

59:20.144 --> 59:22.937
These are all fuckers.
You look fantastic.

59:22.938 --> 59:25.315
I look like Jane Austen
threw up all over me.

59:25.316 --> 59:27.984
You do not look like
Jane Austen threw...

59:27.985 --> 59:30.362
No, you look absolutely beautiful.

59:30.363 --> 59:31.738
You can breathe in
that thing, right?

59:31.739 --> 59:32.906
There's nothing I like more than

59:32.907 --> 59:34.657
putting on some
loose, baggy clothes,

59:34.658 --> 59:36.409
and just being able to relax.

59:36.410 --> 59:38.912
Yeah, this is an end-of-the-workday
outfit you have on.

59:38.913 --> 59:41.581
I'm very glad I
remembered the six items

59:41.582 --> 59:43.333
I somehow require to
hold up my pants.

59:43.334 --> 59:44.376
Oh, yeah.

59:44.377 --> 59:45.585
I like your bustle, by the way.

59:45.586 --> 59:46.753
Oh, yeah.

59:46.754 --> 59:49.756
I really love that the most
alluring fashion statement

59:49.757 --> 59:51.174
a woman can make today

59:51.175 --> 59:52.509
is to simulate a fat ass.

59:52.510 --> 59:54.844
- That is a simulation of a fat ass, right there.
- Thank you.

59:54.845 --> 59:58.348
If I was a black guy, this is the
meanest trick you could play on me.

59:58.349 --> 01:00:00.809
Because I'd be like,
"Oh, my God! Look.

01:00:00.810 --> 01:00:02.394
"There's a fat ass, my favorite."

01:00:02.395 --> 01:00:05.021
And then I'd lift it up and I'd be
like, "Oh, shit, it's a big joke."

01:00:05.022 --> 01:00:07.232
I know, exactly, because
when you lift it up

01:00:07.233 --> 01:00:09.442
there's nothing but a
metal cage under there.

01:00:09.443 --> 01:00:11.695
Wow!

01:00:11.696 --> 01:00:14.364
You are ready to relieve
the stress of the day.

01:00:14.365 --> 01:00:17.275
Completely.

01:00:20.413 --> 01:00:23.248
Well, at the very least,
this will be a good way

01:00:23.249 --> 01:00:25.458
to spend my last
night alive, right?

01:00:25.459 --> 01:00:26.626
Albert.

01:00:26.627 --> 01:00:28.253
What?

01:00:28.254 --> 01:00:30.830
Do you trust me?

01:00:31.924 --> 01:00:33.925
Yeah, I do.

01:00:33.926 --> 01:00:36.970
Good. You're gonna be fine.

01:00:36.971 --> 01:00:38.722
If I thought you were
gonna lose this gunfight,

01:00:38.723 --> 01:00:42.634
I'd make you call it off. Okay?

01:00:44.979 --> 01:00:47.430
Yeah, okay.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.766
Trust me.

01:00:53.237 --> 01:00:57.073
Hey, how about it
for the James Gang?

01:00:57.074 --> 01:01:00.618
Thank you. Hey, hey, it's great
to be back here in Old Stump.

01:01:00.619 --> 01:01:03.079
Any Indians here tonight?
How'd you get tickets?

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:05.990
Let me guess. Scalpers.

01:01:07.752 --> 01:01:11.129
But I tell ya, folks, this telegraph
machine... That thing is nuts.

01:01:11.130 --> 01:01:14.090
I mean, sure, it's faster
than the Pony Express,

01:01:14.091 --> 01:01:16.676
but what good is it if you can't
send a picture of your dick?

01:01:18.095 --> 01:01:19.763
Okay, they're giving
me the lantern.

01:01:19.764 --> 01:01:22.432
Enjoy the bison and I hope
you're enjoying your drinks

01:01:22.433 --> 01:01:25.935
as much as my horse enjoyed
making them for you.

01:01:25.936 --> 01:01:30.306
Now, let's all line up for
the sweetheart dance.

01:01:30.775 --> 01:01:32.442
Come on, let's go.

01:01:32.443 --> 01:01:34.110
No, no, no! I suck at dancing.

01:01:34.111 --> 01:01:35.278
No one will notice.

01:01:35.279 --> 01:01:36.363
How will they not notice?

01:01:36.364 --> 01:01:38.690
Because you suck at everything.

01:01:38.741 --> 01:01:40.116
Well, well!

01:01:40.117 --> 01:01:42.786
Hello, there, sheepie.

01:01:42.787 --> 01:01:45.372
Hello, Foy. Hey, Louise.

01:01:45.373 --> 01:01:46.498
Hey, Albert.

01:01:46.499 --> 01:01:48.833
So, big day tomorrow.

01:01:48.834 --> 01:01:51.503
Care for a last dance?

01:01:51.504 --> 01:01:52.962
With you?

01:01:52.963 --> 01:01:54.547
No, not with me.

01:01:54.548 --> 01:01:55.715
- I mean, the dance.
- Oh!

01:01:55.716 --> 01:01:57.967
Yeah. No, yeah, no.
She and I are gonna dance.

01:01:57.968 --> 01:02:00.470
And now, to serenade us
for the sweetheart dance,

01:02:00.471 --> 01:02:04.132
our very own Marcus Thornton!

01:02:04.642 --> 01:02:07.010
Shit crowd.

01:02:14.443 --> 01:02:17.987
Ready for weird, stiff,
traditional frontier dancing?

01:02:17.988 --> 01:02:19.072
Fuck, yes.

01:02:22.493 --> 01:02:24.452
<i>You men who long for love</i>

01:02:24.453 --> 01:02:26.204
<i>You mustn't all despair</i>

01:02:26.205 --> 01:02:28.665
<i>There's a secret you should know</i>

01:02:28.666 --> 01:02:30.375
<i>To capture the hearts of the fair</i>

01:02:30.376 --> 01:02:34.295
<i>You may not have the looks
You may not have the dash</i>

01:02:34.296 --> 01:02:36.214
<i>But you'll win yourself a girl</i>

01:02:36.215 --> 01:02:38.008
<i>If you've only got a moustache</i>

01:02:38.009 --> 01:02:40.135
<i>A moustache
A moustache</i>

01:02:40.136 --> 01:02:43.546
<i>If you've only got a moustache</i>

01:02:45.766 --> 01:02:48.059
<i>You may be common folk</i>

01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:49.894
<i>Without a hint of pride</i>

01:02:49.895 --> 01:02:51.896
<i>But you needn't be a king</i>

01:02:51.897 --> 01:02:53.898
<i>To make any maiden a bride</i>

01:02:53.899 --> 01:02:58.069
<i>You may not have the name
You may not have the cash</i>

01:02:58.070 --> 01:02:59.696
<i>But you'll make that girl your own</i>

01:02:59.697 --> 01:03:01.489
<i>If you've only got a moustache</i>

01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:02.574
<i>A moustache</i>

01:03:02.575 --> 01:03:06.486
<i>A moustache
If you've only got a moustache</i>

01:03:09.749 --> 01:03:11.541
<i>You may be big and fat</i>

01:03:11.542 --> 01:03:13.376
<i>Or uglier than sin</i>

01:03:13.377 --> 01:03:15.837
<i>All the ladies shut you out</i>

01:03:15.838 --> 01:03:17.756
<i>You're wondering how to get in</i>

01:03:17.757 --> 01:03:21.176
<i>Well, here is my advice
For how to make a splash</i>

01:03:21.177 --> 01:03:23.219
<i>You can have your pick of gals</i>

01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:25.096
<i>If you've only got a moustache</i>

01:03:25.097 --> 01:03:26.931
<i>A moustache
A moustache</i>

01:03:26.932 --> 01:03:28.933
<i>If you've only got a moustache</i>

01:03:28.934 --> 01:03:32.228
<i>A moustache, a moustache,
a moustache</i>

01:03:32.229 --> 01:03:34.022
<i>Big moustache, thick moustache</i>

01:03:34.023 --> 01:03:35.774
<i>My moustache, your moustache</i>

01:03:35.775 --> 01:03:37.859
<i>Say the word, the word "moustache"</i>

01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:39.736
<i>A moustache, a moustache</i>

01:03:39.737 --> 01:03:41.488
<i>Now we both have said "moustache"</i>

01:03:41.489 --> 01:03:42.739
<i>A moustache</i>

01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:46.242
<i>A moustache
If you've only got a moustache</i>

01:03:53.292 --> 01:03:55.585
Fucking asshole.

01:03:55.586 --> 01:03:58.588
How about I steal a bottle of
whiskey and we get out of here?

01:03:58.589 --> 01:03:59.756
Love that idea.

01:03:59.757 --> 01:04:02.250
I'll be right back.

01:04:02.468 --> 01:04:05.295
Your dick's out.

01:04:19.944 --> 01:04:21.945
Hey.

01:04:21.946 --> 01:04:24.406
So, Albert and I are gonna split,

01:04:24.407 --> 01:04:27.450
but I just wanted to come by
and wish you luck tomorrow.

01:04:27.451 --> 01:04:29.986
Thank you.

01:04:30.496 --> 01:04:31.955
So, I guess it's kind of weird

01:04:31.956 --> 01:04:33.331
knowing that a woman
can outshoot you, huh?

01:04:33.332 --> 01:04:34.416
If you don't mind,

01:04:34.417 --> 01:04:36.251
my girlfriend and I are
enjoying each other's company.

01:04:36.252 --> 01:04:38.786
Want to know the
real kicker, though?

01:04:39.505 --> 01:04:42.290
I can outdrink you, too.

01:04:42.466 --> 01:04:47.795
That, I can assure
you, is impossible.

01:04:48.305 --> 01:04:51.507
Fifty cents to the winner.

01:04:52.977 --> 01:04:54.644
One,

01:04:54.645 --> 01:04:56.438
two,

01:04:56.439 --> 01:04:58.640
three.

01:05:02.862 --> 01:05:04.154
Oh, shit!

01:05:04.155 --> 01:05:05.238
Don't feel bad.

01:05:05.239 --> 01:05:09.451
Alcohol doesn't harmonize well with a
woman's frail constitution, anyway.

01:05:09.452 --> 01:05:10.785
I guess not.

01:05:10.786 --> 01:05:12.120
Here you go.

01:05:12.121 --> 01:05:14.456
You can buy your
girlfriend a brain.

01:05:14.457 --> 01:05:15.874
Excuse me?

01:05:15.875 --> 01:05:17.625
You're an idiot.

01:05:17.626 --> 01:05:20.712
You have the nicest guy in the world
throwing himself at your feet

01:05:20.713 --> 01:05:23.173
and here you are with
this complete asshole.

01:05:23.174 --> 01:05:25.717
Who I go out with
is my own business.

01:05:25.718 --> 01:05:28.928
So, why don't you
mind your own, bitch?

01:05:28.929 --> 01:05:33.341
How are you so blind
with eyes that big?

01:05:34.518 --> 01:05:36.936
Enjoy your night.

01:05:36.937 --> 01:05:39.064
They're not that big.

01:05:39.065 --> 01:05:41.691
No, my dear, they're
practically Chinese.

01:05:41.692 --> 01:05:42.859
God, I love you.

01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:45.436
I love you, too.

01:05:50.534 --> 01:05:52.827
How's that?

01:05:52.828 --> 01:05:54.371
Ooh.

01:05:54.372 --> 01:05:55.580
Wow.

01:05:55.581 --> 01:05:57.374
- Um...
- It'll keep us warm, though.

01:05:57.375 --> 01:05:58.541
Are you cold?

01:05:58.542 --> 01:05:59.668
A little.

01:05:59.669 --> 01:06:00.710
Here, take...

01:06:00.711 --> 01:06:02.587
- No, no, no! It's okay.
- No, it's fine. Here.

01:06:02.588 --> 01:06:07.425
This has been in my family
for 97 generations.

01:06:08.552 --> 01:06:11.012
I can't get that goddamn
moustache song out of my head.

01:06:11.013 --> 01:06:12.597
Oh, just think of another song.

01:06:12.598 --> 01:06:14.724
I can't. There's only,
like, three songs.

01:06:14.725 --> 01:06:17.018
Oh, that's true. And they're
all by Stephen Foster.

01:06:17.019 --> 01:06:19.187
Yeah.

01:06:19.188 --> 01:06:20.730
Mmm.

01:06:20.731 --> 01:06:23.233
Um...

01:06:23.234 --> 01:06:24.943
Hey, you know, whatever
happens tomorrow,

01:06:24.944 --> 01:06:29.114
I just... I just want
to say thank you.

01:06:29.115 --> 01:06:30.407
Uh...

01:06:30.408 --> 01:06:34.744
I couldn't have gotten
this far without you.

01:06:34.745 --> 01:06:39.749
And this may be the booze talking,
or your pep talk, or both,

01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:42.085
but I think I can do it.

01:06:42.086 --> 01:06:44.087
You know, I think I can beat him.

01:06:44.088 --> 01:06:46.214
Well, I'll tell you this, you
sound a lot more confident

01:06:46.215 --> 01:06:50.293
than that guy who dragged me out
of the saloon not too long ago.

01:06:50.386 --> 01:06:51.428
You know, it's funny.

01:06:51.429 --> 01:06:53.430
I still feel like I don't know

01:06:53.431 --> 01:06:56.516
anything about you
after all this time.

01:06:56.517 --> 01:07:01.804
And I feel like every time I bring
it up, you change the subject.

01:07:01.939 --> 01:07:04.399
There really isn't
that much to tell.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:07.986
My story is a lot like
yours, I suppose.

01:07:07.987 --> 01:07:11.656
Because I'll tell you, I hate the
West just as much as you do.

01:07:11.657 --> 01:07:12.782
Do you really?

01:07:12.783 --> 01:07:14.325
For my own reasons, but, yeah.

01:07:14.326 --> 01:07:16.786
Oh, I like you even more now.

01:07:16.787 --> 01:07:19.456
There is something about
connecting over mutual hatred

01:07:19.457 --> 01:07:21.291
that's just so much
deeper than mutual love.

01:07:21.292 --> 01:07:22.417
It's true, right?

01:07:22.418 --> 01:07:25.253
If two people hate the same
things, it creates a bond.

01:07:25.254 --> 01:07:26.463
Hate can move mountains.

01:07:26.464 --> 01:07:27.630
Yes.

01:07:27.631 --> 01:07:29.466
Oh, hey, you know what?
Before I forget.

01:07:29.467 --> 01:07:31.301
Hey, Bridget, Bridget.

01:07:31.302 --> 01:07:33.178
Yeah, she knows. Come
here. There we go.

01:07:33.179 --> 01:07:34.846
Oh, my God.

01:07:34.847 --> 01:07:36.598
What is this?

01:07:36.599 --> 01:07:40.268
This is just a little
something to say thank you.

01:07:40.269 --> 01:07:41.353
Albert.

01:07:41.354 --> 01:07:45.473
It's nothing huge, it's just...

01:07:46.359 --> 01:07:47.650
Okay, don't get too excited.

01:07:47.651 --> 01:07:50.019
What is it? What is it? What is it?

01:07:51.655 --> 01:07:52.989
Holy shit.

01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:54.366
I know, right?

01:07:54.367 --> 01:07:55.658
- He's smiling.
- Yeah.

01:07:55.659 --> 01:07:57.035
No, in the picture, he's smiling!

01:07:57.036 --> 01:07:58.119
Isn't that amazing?

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.246
I bought that off a peddler who was
coming through town last week.

01:08:00.247 --> 01:08:02.248
- This is the guy I was telling you about.
- Uh-huh.

01:08:02.249 --> 01:08:03.500
I didn't even know this existed.

01:08:03.501 --> 01:08:05.794
- And apparently, he's not insane.
- Bullshit!

01:08:05.795 --> 01:08:06.961
That's what the guy told me.

01:08:06.962 --> 01:08:09.172
It takes 30 seconds
to take a photograph.

01:08:09.173 --> 01:08:10.590
This guy would have
had to sit there

01:08:10.591 --> 01:08:12.384
and smile for 30 sustained seconds.

01:08:12.385 --> 01:08:14.928
I know. I've never been happy for
30 seconds in a row in my life.

01:08:14.929 --> 01:08:17.346
No one has. It's the fucking West!

01:08:17.348 --> 01:08:18.807
He's gotta be insane!

01:08:18.808 --> 01:08:21.551
Who the fuck knows?

01:08:24.772 --> 01:08:27.189
This is incredibly sweet.

01:08:27.191 --> 01:08:30.359
It's nothing. It's...

01:08:30.361 --> 01:08:33.062
I owe you.

01:08:33.447 --> 01:08:37.149
No one's ever done
anything like this for me.

01:08:37.326 --> 01:08:39.285
Oh, come on, now.

01:08:39.286 --> 01:08:42.071
Thank you.

01:09:11.277 --> 01:09:13.819
Uh...

01:09:13.821 --> 01:09:15.738
I'm sorry.

01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:18.942
I... I shouldn't have done that.

01:09:20.036 --> 01:09:23.912
No, it's... It's fine.

01:09:23.913 --> 01:09:25.749
You...

01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:30.578
You've just been a really good
friend to me. That's all.

01:09:33.381 --> 01:09:37.252
Yeah. I, um...

01:09:38.261 --> 01:09:39.845
It's late.

01:09:39.846 --> 01:09:42.599
Yeah, I should take you home.

01:10:21.263 --> 01:10:23.640
Oh, thanks.

01:10:23.641 --> 01:10:27.310
Good luck tomorrow.
I'm gonna be there.

01:10:27.311 --> 01:10:30.013
Good.

01:10:30.398 --> 01:10:32.724
Okay.

01:10:58.175 --> 01:10:59.926
Um...

01:10:59.927 --> 01:11:01.970
Good night.

01:11:01.971 --> 01:11:04.339
Good night.

01:12:02.198 --> 01:12:04.440
Hello?

01:12:09.497 --> 01:12:11.915
What, uh... What's that?

01:12:11.916 --> 01:12:14.951
Nothing.

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:18.088
It's a weather experiment.

01:12:18.089 --> 01:12:20.373
Oh.

01:12:22.259 --> 01:12:25.211
Great Scott!

01:12:29.767 --> 01:12:31.518
Are you sure you can't call it off?

01:12:31.519 --> 01:12:34.354
Of course not. I'd
be branded a coward.

01:12:34.355 --> 01:12:37.399
Baby, if you fight him
tomorrow, you will kill him.

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.984
Yes, that's what
happens in a gunfight.

01:12:39.985 --> 01:12:42.529
But he's not a bad guy, Foy.

01:12:42.530 --> 01:12:44.406
I mean, yeah, he's kind of a loser

01:12:44.407 --> 01:12:46.408
and he always smells like sheep,

01:12:46.409 --> 01:12:47.617
but he doesn't deserve to be shot.

01:12:47.618 --> 01:12:48.993
Louise!

01:12:48.994 --> 01:12:51.329
My decision is final.

01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:52.831
Now, do it.

01:12:52.832 --> 01:12:54.082
Hey, I'm really tired.

01:12:54.083 --> 01:12:56.784
Louise!

01:13:08.889 --> 01:13:12.267
My social stature is significant.

01:13:12.268 --> 01:13:14.853
I'm an important man.

01:13:14.854 --> 01:13:16.938
I have my own business.

01:13:16.939 --> 01:13:19.482
People envy me.

01:13:21.402 --> 01:13:23.486
Ooh...

01:13:23.487 --> 01:13:25.855
What's wrong?

01:13:26.032 --> 01:13:29.275
- Foy!
- Not now!

01:14:07.615 --> 01:14:10.984
Hello, sweetheart.

01:14:30.054 --> 01:14:32.589
Where's Anna?

01:15:08.509 --> 01:15:10.793
Well, now,

01:15:10.928 --> 01:15:14.431
I didn't think you'd show, sheepie.

01:15:14.432 --> 01:15:17.800
Yeah, listen, Foy...

01:15:22.606 --> 01:15:24.807
Oh...

01:15:25.026 --> 01:15:27.610
Oh. Oh...

01:16:32.134 --> 01:16:34.844
Holy shit. You all... You all done?

01:16:34.845 --> 01:16:36.721
I'm good.

01:16:36.722 --> 01:16:38.965
Okay.

01:16:40.017 --> 01:16:42.886
Listen, Foy,

01:16:46.524 --> 01:16:49.350
she's all yours.

01:16:51.195 --> 01:16:53.571
Louise,

01:16:53.572 --> 01:16:55.573
you know, I really
do care about you.

01:16:55.574 --> 01:16:58.868
But, I don't know,
somewhere along the line

01:16:58.869 --> 01:17:04.407
I guess I just forgot that a
relationship is a two-way street.

01:17:04.625 --> 01:17:07.752
And I've been reminded recently

01:17:07.753 --> 01:17:11.831
of what it's like to have
somebody care about me.

01:17:12.091 --> 01:17:14.584
And I like it.

01:17:14.677 --> 01:17:18.847
So, if you want to spend the rest of
your life with a pussy full of hair,

01:17:18.848 --> 01:17:23.384
I say, go with God and
best of luck to you.

01:17:28.733 --> 01:17:31.109
You know, I just realized that last
joke might not have been clear.

01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:33.570
I didn't mean that she
has a hairy pussy.

01:17:33.571 --> 01:17:36.865
I meant that Foy has a moustache,

01:17:36.866 --> 01:17:41.494
so, you know, he gets hair in her

01:17:41.495 --> 01:17:46.157
when he goes down there.

01:17:46.751 --> 01:17:49.911
Yeah.

01:17:53.341 --> 01:17:55.792
I got it.

01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:10.682
Anna?

01:18:22.828 --> 01:18:26.155
- Coward.
- Thank you.

01:18:26.415 --> 01:18:28.166
She's not there.

01:18:28.167 --> 01:18:30.460
- Well, I'm sure she's okay.
- I don't understand.

01:18:30.461 --> 01:18:32.128
We've been prepping for
this gunfight for a week.

01:18:32.129 --> 01:18:33.421
She wouldn't just not show up.

01:18:33.422 --> 01:18:36.508
Hey, do you... Do you think
you guys are gonna have sex?

01:18:36.509 --> 01:18:37.634
Uh...

01:18:37.635 --> 01:18:39.636
Maybe, at some point. I don't know.

01:18:39.637 --> 01:18:41.179
Well, when you do, let us know

01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:43.515
because maybe we can make
it an all-us-friends thing.

01:18:43.516 --> 01:18:45.684
You know, we can all get in
sync together, sexually.

01:18:45.685 --> 01:18:48.436
- Edward, we are not having sex.
- Sorry.

01:18:48.437 --> 01:18:49.813
Ruth! Let's fuck!

01:18:49.814 --> 01:18:51.981
Coming!

01:18:51.982 --> 01:18:55.393
She keeps my head on straight.

01:19:12.545 --> 01:19:14.462
Clinch Leatherwood.

01:19:14.463 --> 01:19:15.547
Great.

01:19:15.548 --> 01:19:17.841
Look at this. Another
thing that can kill us.

01:19:17.842 --> 01:19:20.135
We should all just wear
coffins as clothes.

01:19:20.136 --> 01:19:21.678
Shh.

01:19:21.679 --> 01:19:27.050
Somebody in this wee shithole
of a town is going to die.

01:19:27.309 --> 01:19:33.064
One of my boys saw a man
kissing my wife last night.

01:19:33.065 --> 01:19:35.025
I want to know who it was.

01:19:35.026 --> 01:19:36.693
Oh, man!

01:19:36.694 --> 01:19:40.155
Somebody's gonna get fucked up.

01:19:40.156 --> 01:19:42.866
Now, you all seem like good folk.

01:19:42.867 --> 01:19:47.528
And good folk know better than
to take what isn't theirs.

01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:50.698
And this...

01:19:58.924 --> 01:20:01.751
This is mine.

01:20:03.262 --> 01:20:06.556
So, I'm going to ask one more time.

01:20:06.557 --> 01:20:09.467
Who was it?

01:20:09.894 --> 01:20:12.303
Mmm?

01:20:14.523 --> 01:20:16.891
Who?

01:20:23.866 --> 01:20:26.242
Now, you make sure he
gets this message.

01:20:26.243 --> 01:20:31.081
Either he meets me outside in the
main thoroughfare at noon tomorrow

01:20:31.082 --> 01:20:33.416
or I start killing more people.

01:20:33.417 --> 01:20:35.952
All right?

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:45.628
Albert, you gotta get out of here.

01:21:07.785 --> 01:21:12.414
Boys, there's an abandoned sod
house back around that bend.

01:21:12.415 --> 01:21:13.957
We'll stash the gold there.

01:21:13.958 --> 01:21:16.167
Ben, you take the men
and set up camp.

01:21:16.168 --> 01:21:18.712
I need some alone
time with my wife.

01:21:18.713 --> 01:21:19.796
Got it, Clinch.

01:21:19.797 --> 01:21:21.965
Let's go, boys. Come on!

01:21:21.966 --> 01:21:24.834
Go on, get down.

01:21:29.849 --> 01:21:31.641
Who was it?

01:21:31.642 --> 01:21:33.184
Huh?

01:21:33.185 --> 01:21:34.978
Mark Twain.

01:21:34.979 --> 01:21:36.771
What? Is it?

01:21:36.772 --> 01:21:39.983
Jesus. How fucking stupid are you?

01:21:39.984 --> 01:21:41.151
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:21:41.152 --> 01:21:42.444
Who?

01:21:43.946 --> 01:21:46.114
I'm not gonna ask you again. Who?

01:21:46.115 --> 01:21:50.368
Okay, it's... It's Sheriff Brady.
But please, please, please.

01:21:50.369 --> 01:21:53.621
I'm begging you.
Don't hurt him, okay?

01:21:53.622 --> 01:21:55.457
After all the lovely years
we've been together

01:21:55.458 --> 01:21:57.334
you think I don't know
when you're lying?

01:21:57.335 --> 01:22:00.036
I'm not.

01:22:02.006 --> 01:22:04.707
Plugger.

01:22:05.801 --> 01:22:09.554
Tell me who it is or Plugger gets
plugged between his pretty eyes.

01:22:09.555 --> 01:22:12.757
- Come on, Clinch.
- You think I'm joking?

01:22:12.892 --> 01:22:15.101
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Okay, okay, okay.

01:22:15.102 --> 01:22:16.311
Who?

01:22:20.483 --> 01:22:22.692
It's Albert Stark.

01:22:22.693 --> 01:22:25.645
Albert Stark.

01:22:25.696 --> 01:22:28.565
That's better.

01:22:31.077 --> 01:22:33.244
I've been keeping it nice and soft.

01:22:33.245 --> 01:22:35.738
See?

01:22:42.046 --> 01:22:43.129
Mmm!

01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:47.050
I've missed you, baby.
Oh, I've missed you a lot.

01:22:48.219 --> 01:22:52.347
The longer the ride,
the lonelier a man gets.

01:22:52.348 --> 01:22:55.016
And he needs the comforting touch

01:22:55.017 --> 01:22:59.229
of the woman he loves to
soothe his tired bones.

01:22:59.230 --> 01:23:01.231
And now, I'm here,

01:23:01.232 --> 01:23:02.899
you're here,

01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:05.860
and we have time to
be husband and wife.

01:23:05.861 --> 01:23:07.070
The proper way.

01:23:07.071 --> 01:23:08.571
Hey, asshole.

01:23:20.418 --> 01:23:21.626
Oh, shit.

01:23:21.627 --> 01:23:24.787
I can't leave him like that.

01:23:34.598 --> 01:23:36.799
That's better.

01:24:08.632 --> 01:24:11.251
Albert?

01:24:13.846 --> 01:24:15.305
Albert!

01:24:15.306 --> 01:24:16.765
Albert, you gotta get out of here.

01:24:16.766 --> 01:24:18.683
Yeah, that's... That's
what I'm doing.

01:24:18.684 --> 01:24:20.310
No, no, no. Like, right now.

01:24:20.311 --> 01:24:21.770
Clinch is gonna be looking for you.

01:24:21.771 --> 01:24:23.438
Yeah, I'm leaving.

01:24:23.439 --> 01:24:25.065
Uh, I'm going to San Francisco.

01:24:25.066 --> 01:24:28.985
Just what I should
have done a week ago.

01:24:28.986 --> 01:24:30.195
I'm so sorry.

01:24:30.196 --> 01:24:32.447
Yeah, well, you know, so am I.

01:24:32.448 --> 01:24:34.115
What about your dad?

01:24:34.116 --> 01:24:36.743
I asked him if he wanted
to come, and he said no.

01:24:36.744 --> 01:24:40.196
He's up on the hill, burying
himself next to Mom.

01:24:41.374 --> 01:24:42.749
Look, I never meant to mislead...

01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:43.833
Okay, you know what, Anna?

01:24:43.834 --> 01:24:45.710
Don't even waste my time, okay?

01:24:45.711 --> 01:24:46.836
Don't even waste my time.

01:24:46.837 --> 01:24:50.507
You had a million opportunities to
tell me, and you just fucking lied.

01:24:50.508 --> 01:24:51.633
I didn't lie.

01:24:51.634 --> 01:24:52.759
What would you call it?

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:56.012
You're married to the most
vicious killer in the territory.

01:24:56.013 --> 01:24:58.723
You don't think maybe that's
something you should have told me?

01:24:58.724 --> 01:25:01.017
I didn't tell you because I
was trying to protect you.

01:25:01.018 --> 01:25:03.353
Oh, bullshit! You were looking
out for your own self-interest.

01:25:03.354 --> 01:25:06.231
And because I liked you.

01:25:06.232 --> 01:25:09.192
I didn't want to scare you away.

01:25:09.193 --> 01:25:11.736
I never thought I'd meet
someone like you, Albert.

01:25:11.737 --> 01:25:13.905
What, somebody who hasn't killed
people? Somebody like that?

01:25:13.906 --> 01:25:15.198
Yeah, that's really hard to find.

01:25:15.199 --> 01:25:16.366
That's why women are always going,

01:25:16.367 --> 01:25:19.536
"Oh, my God. Why are all
the non-murderers taken?"

01:25:19.537 --> 01:25:21.204
Hey. It's not my fault, all right?

01:25:21.205 --> 01:25:23.039
We were married when I was nine.

01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:25.125
Nine?

01:25:25.126 --> 01:25:27.085
How does that even work?
Was there a ceremony?

01:25:27.086 --> 01:25:28.211
Yeah, of course there was a...

01:25:28.212 --> 01:25:30.547
My parents were there,
and a couple of neighbors.

01:25:30.548 --> 01:25:32.007
I just didn't want to end
up like one of those

01:25:32.008 --> 01:25:34.968
15-year-old spinsters, you know?

01:25:34.969 --> 01:25:37.053
You know, I don't even know...

01:25:37.054 --> 01:25:39.639
I don't even know
why I'm surprised.

01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:42.892
Every girl that I ever fall in love
with ends up disappointing me.

01:25:42.893 --> 01:25:46.596
And every time, I'm surprised.

01:25:48.315 --> 01:25:49.649
You love me?

01:25:49.650 --> 01:25:51.985
Oh, you know what?
I'm over it. You can go.

01:25:51.986 --> 01:25:53.611
All right. I lied, fine.

01:25:53.612 --> 01:25:55.905
What was I supposed
to say, Albert? Tell me.

01:25:55.906 --> 01:25:57.657
Was I supposed to go,
"Oh hi, I'm Anna!

01:25:57.658 --> 01:25:59.325
"I've been fucking a
killer since I was 10"?

01:25:59.326 --> 01:26:01.286
Oh, he waited a year?
What a gentleman.

01:26:01.287 --> 01:26:02.787
Well, late nine. I rounded it up.

01:26:02.788 --> 01:26:04.205
It doesn't matter.
I'm done with him.

01:26:04.206 --> 01:26:07.667
I knocked him out, and I stuck
a daisy in his asshole.

01:26:07.668 --> 01:26:09.419
You what?

01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:12.172
That's how much you mean to me.

01:26:12.173 --> 01:26:14.749
You know,

01:26:15.176 --> 01:26:20.255
I loved a girl who
doesn't even exist.

01:26:20.431 --> 01:26:23.475
Is your name even Anna? Huh?

01:26:23.476 --> 01:26:25.602
Or is it something
terrible, like Gwendolyn?

01:26:25.603 --> 01:26:30.857
My name is Anna. I'm that
same girl you fell in love with.

01:26:30.858 --> 01:26:33.643
That was the real me.

01:26:33.861 --> 01:26:38.073
Possibly for the first
time in my entire life.

01:26:38.074 --> 01:26:39.866
I just didn't think I
deserved a good guy.

01:26:39.867 --> 01:26:43.111
But you know what? I do.

01:26:45.873 --> 01:26:48.449
I love you.

01:27:03.432 --> 01:27:04.766
It's Clinch.

01:27:04.767 --> 01:27:07.719
Oh, shit.

01:27:07.728 --> 01:27:09.187
There's a trail out back
that leads out to the ridge.

01:27:09.188 --> 01:27:10.522
Go.

01:27:10.523 --> 01:27:13.516
- He's gonna kill...
- Anna, just go!

01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:20.148
Albert, he always shoots on "two."

01:27:40.928 --> 01:27:45.006
Enoch, Jordy, look
after the horses.

01:28:05.828 --> 01:28:07.454
He ain't here, Clinch.

01:28:07.455 --> 01:28:11.991
Oh, he's around. He's around.

01:28:17.715 --> 01:28:19.716
Stark!

01:28:19.717 --> 01:28:22.710
I know you're here, Stark!

01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:26.798
Ben, check the outhouse.
Lewis, the shed.

01:29:17.274 --> 01:29:19.109
Lewis.

01:29:19.110 --> 01:29:21.194
Sometime this week, yeah?

01:29:21.195 --> 01:29:23.646
Sorry, boss.

01:29:56.689 --> 01:29:58.398
Hey!

01:29:58.399 --> 01:30:01.351
There he goes! Boss!

01:30:05.197 --> 01:30:07.398
Shit.

01:30:10.161 --> 01:30:12.695
Get him!

01:30:31.015 --> 01:30:33.216
Hyah!

01:31:04.924 --> 01:31:07.125
Hyah!

01:31:20.731 --> 01:31:22.482
Ha!

01:31:56.225 --> 01:31:59.227
What in the hell do we do now?

01:31:59.228 --> 01:32:02.263
He'll be back.

01:32:16.746 --> 01:32:20.331
Ah, Curtis. That was
exceptional, buddy.

01:32:20.332 --> 01:32:21.499
I tell you,

01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:23.960
when we get out of this, I'm
gonna get you some horse whores.

01:32:23.961 --> 01:32:25.170
Sound good?

01:32:25.171 --> 01:32:26.629
Get you whatever you want.

01:32:26.630 --> 01:32:28.757
Can even get you a cow,
if you want one of those.

01:32:28.758 --> 01:32:30.342
Want to fuck a cow?

01:32:30.343 --> 01:32:33.386
You seem like a pretty
sexually adventurous guy.

01:32:39.477 --> 01:32:43.012
Now, how the fuck
do you make a fire?

01:32:45.232 --> 01:32:47.400
Are you sure you want to do this?

01:32:47.401 --> 01:32:49.569
Yes, I'm absolutely sure.

01:32:49.570 --> 01:32:52.322
Wow, I can't believe we're
actually gonna have sex.

01:32:52.323 --> 01:32:55.575
Eddie, with Clinch Leatherwood in
town, we could all die tomorrow.

01:32:55.576 --> 01:32:57.994
So, under the circumstances,

01:32:57.995 --> 01:33:00.330
I think God will forgive us.

01:33:00.331 --> 01:33:01.998
Okay, here we go.

01:33:01.999 --> 01:33:03.041
Are you excited?

01:33:03.042 --> 01:33:04.834
Yeah, this is my first vagina.

01:33:04.835 --> 01:33:06.336
You've never seen one?

01:33:06.337 --> 01:33:08.755
No. I feel like I should have
a piece of cake or something.

01:33:08.756 --> 01:33:09.839
Okay, you ready?

01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:12.166
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:33:16.013 --> 01:33:18.548
Okay.

01:33:20.267 --> 01:33:22.719
What?

01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:24.854
Are you in pain right now?

01:33:24.855 --> 01:33:25.897
You don't like it.

01:33:25.898 --> 01:33:27.399
No, I love it!

01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:28.983
Yeah, yeah, it's just...

01:33:30.528 --> 01:33:33.613
It looks like a firecracker
wrapped in roast beef.

01:33:33.614 --> 01:33:35.365
Yeah, but there's more to it.

01:33:35.366 --> 01:33:37.325
That's just the outside.
There's folds.

01:33:37.326 --> 01:33:39.202
Okay! I'm gonna close
the Bible now.

01:33:39.203 --> 01:33:41.204
Eddie, it's supposed
to be like that.

01:33:41.205 --> 01:33:42.539
It is?

01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:44.374
It's gonna feel good.

01:33:45.501 --> 01:33:47.711
I'm really glad I didn't
have that piece of cake.

01:33:49.505 --> 01:33:51.923
Oh, okay.

01:33:51.924 --> 01:33:53.550
Okay, ready?

01:33:53.551 --> 01:33:55.427
This is gonna be good.
You're gonna like this.

01:33:55.428 --> 01:33:57.095
Okay, easy, now.

01:33:57.096 --> 01:33:58.888
Sorry. This is...

01:33:58.889 --> 01:34:00.432
Yeah. Wow.

01:34:00.433 --> 01:34:01.766
Okay, is that...

01:34:01.767 --> 01:34:03.059
- Right there?
- Yeah.

01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:06.512
Sure, okay. Wow.

01:34:08.274 --> 01:34:11.067
Okay, I get it. It's
pretty big, right?

01:34:11.068 --> 01:34:12.569
Yeah, you're huge!

01:34:12.570 --> 01:34:13.903
No, I meant you.

01:34:21.746 --> 01:34:23.329
- Anna!
- Ruth, can I come in?

01:34:23.330 --> 01:34:25.949
Sure.

01:34:32.089 --> 01:34:34.541
Clinch is out there.

01:34:43.684 --> 01:34:45.685
He's coming up the stairs!

01:34:45.686 --> 01:34:47.929
Shit!

01:35:02.244 --> 01:35:05.738
Please don't shoot us on sex night.

01:35:23.599 --> 01:35:26.885
You and I have a problem.

01:35:50.292 --> 01:35:51.793
Oh, shit.

01:38:03.342 --> 01:38:06.302
It's coming. I see it, I see it.

01:38:08.973 --> 01:38:10.974
It's a boy, Mr. Stark.

01:38:10.975 --> 01:38:12.642
All right.

01:38:12.643 --> 01:38:15.311
Well, don't you want
to come hold the baby?

01:38:15.312 --> 01:38:17.480
Fuck off.

01:38:17.481 --> 01:38:19.274
Now, you put that under your pillow

01:38:19.275 --> 01:38:23.770
and the tooth fairy
will leave you a penny.

01:38:30.703 --> 01:38:32.495
There ain't no tooth fairy, idiot!

01:38:32.496 --> 01:38:35.823
Now, clean up that horse shit!

01:38:37.335 --> 01:38:40.337
Class, please welcome
our graduation speaker,

01:38:40.338 --> 01:38:43.581
President Abraham Lincoln.

01:38:47.678 --> 01:38:49.721
Hiya, shmucks!

01:38:49.722 --> 01:38:52.766
Four score and seven years ago,

01:38:52.767 --> 01:38:54.851
I was broke,

01:38:54.852 --> 01:38:56.686
just like you.

01:38:56.687 --> 01:38:59.439
But now, I'm the president

01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:02.734
and I'm so fucking rich.

01:39:02.735 --> 01:39:06.863
I can have all the licorice I want.

01:39:06.864 --> 01:39:10.233
I don't think that's the
real President Lincoln.

01:39:10.743 --> 01:39:11.951
Hey, Louise!

01:39:11.952 --> 01:39:14.037
Louise, check out
this cool bike I got!

01:39:14.038 --> 01:39:15.246
Hey, you want to go down to the...

01:39:15.247 --> 01:39:18.324
Oh, shit!

01:39:18.417 --> 01:39:20.418
No! Sorry! Sorry!

01:39:24.382 --> 01:39:26.833
No, no, no!

01:39:29.887 --> 01:39:30.929
Stop!

01:39:30.930 --> 01:39:33.056
Get back here!

01:39:33.057 --> 01:39:34.140
Shit, not again.

01:39:34.141 --> 01:39:36.351
Get that son of a bitch!

01:39:49.907 --> 01:39:51.366
You're an idiot.

01:39:51.367 --> 01:39:54.869
How can you be so blind
with eyes that big?

01:39:54.870 --> 01:39:57.789
They're not that big.

01:39:59.625 --> 01:40:02.544
Pardon me, Albert.

01:40:02.545 --> 01:40:06.423
The lads and I have prepared
something special for you.

01:40:09.802 --> 01:40:12.303
<i>You may not have the looks</i>

01:40:12.304 --> 01:40:13.888
<i>You may not have the dash</i>

01:40:13.889 --> 01:40:15.807
<i>But you'll win yourself a girl</i>

01:40:15.808 --> 01:40:17.559
<i>If you've only got a moustache</i>

01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:19.811
<i>A moustache
A moustache</i>

01:40:19.812 --> 01:40:23.264
<i>If you've only got a moustache</i>

01:40:32.992 --> 01:40:36.077
We are the guardians of the future.

01:40:36.078 --> 01:40:38.863
Enter when ready.

01:41:31.008 --> 01:41:33.376
Stark!

01:43:05.853 --> 01:43:08.772
All right, sweetheart.

01:43:08.773 --> 01:43:12.567
Let's find out if your wee
boyfriend gives a shit about you.

01:43:12.568 --> 01:43:15.070
He's got

01:43:15.071 --> 01:43:17.572
six minutes till noon.

01:43:17.573 --> 01:43:19.115
And if he doesn't show,

01:43:19.116 --> 01:43:23.536
he'll be picking up pieces
of you all over the street.

01:43:23.537 --> 01:43:25.863
Stark!

01:43:41.222 --> 01:43:44.757
Oh, look who's here.

01:44:02.118 --> 01:44:03.618
Let her go, Clinch.

01:44:03.619 --> 01:44:07.872
Well, now, true love conquers
all, doesn't it, sweetheart?

01:44:07.873 --> 01:44:09.499
Let her go,

01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:11.668
and let's you and me just
settle this like adults.

01:44:14.255 --> 01:44:15.630
Lewis, Ben.

01:44:15.631 --> 01:44:18.508
- Come and take this whore.
- Albert.

01:44:18.509 --> 01:44:21.261
Don't be stupid, Albert!
Get out of here!

01:44:21.262 --> 01:44:22.595
Get out of here!

01:44:22.596 --> 01:44:23.972
Too late for that.

01:44:23.973 --> 01:44:26.016
He's already been stupid.

01:44:26.017 --> 01:44:27.767
Haven't you, Albert?

01:44:27.768 --> 01:44:30.186
You've been with my wife.

01:44:30.187 --> 01:44:32.564
Well, we haven't actually done it,

01:44:32.565 --> 01:44:35.817
if that makes any
kind of a difference.

01:44:35.818 --> 01:44:38.153
Okay, look, look, look.
Here's my idea, okay?

01:44:38.154 --> 01:44:40.030
You're a pretty tough guy, yeah?

01:44:40.031 --> 01:44:41.281
Why don't you prove it?

01:44:41.282 --> 01:44:45.702
Gunfight. You and me.
Right here. Right now.

01:44:47.455 --> 01:44:50.373
You really do have a
death wish, don't you?

01:44:50.374 --> 01:44:53.668
Yeah, I guess you'll have
to find that out, huh?

01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:55.870
Uh-huh.

01:44:59.884 --> 01:45:02.585
Take out your gun.

01:45:05.431 --> 01:45:06.598
Point it at me.

01:45:06.599 --> 01:45:08.800
No.

01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:13.229
Good boy.

01:45:13.230 --> 01:45:17.267
Now, we shoot on three.

01:45:18.986 --> 01:45:20.945
One.

01:45:27.703 --> 01:45:29.746
I've been playing cards a long time

01:45:29.747 --> 01:45:31.748
and I would never have
bet on that, Stark.

01:45:31.749 --> 01:45:34.158
Where'd you learn to shoot?

01:45:34.168 --> 01:45:35.377
Your wife.

01:45:35.378 --> 01:45:38.037
Oh, snap!

01:45:38.047 --> 01:45:40.415
Holy fuck.

01:45:40.716 --> 01:45:42.509
Okay, look, look, look!
Before you kill me,

01:45:42.510 --> 01:45:44.552
just grant me a few
last words. All right?

01:45:44.553 --> 01:45:46.763
Make it quick.

01:45:46.764 --> 01:45:48.682
Let Anna live.

01:45:48.683 --> 01:45:50.100
All right?

01:45:50.101 --> 01:45:51.267
Let her live.

01:45:51.268 --> 01:45:52.644
This is not her fault.

01:45:52.645 --> 01:45:54.688
I kissed her, she didn't
kiss me, all right?

01:45:54.689 --> 01:45:56.815
It's not her fault.

01:45:56.816 --> 01:45:58.608
I mean, she didn't tell
me she was married,

01:45:58.609 --> 01:46:00.402
so it's a little bit
her fault, I guess.

01:46:00.403 --> 01:46:01.945
So, yeah, I guess
that's kind of true.

01:46:01.946 --> 01:46:05.031
So, maybe just shoot
her in the arm.

01:46:05.032 --> 01:46:06.116
What the...

01:46:06.117 --> 01:46:07.701
And one more thing.

01:46:07.702 --> 01:46:09.828
Um, my grandparents were Arabic.

01:46:09.829 --> 01:46:12.288
So, I'm required by
Muslim tradition

01:46:12.289 --> 01:46:15.250
to recite the Islamic death
chant immediately before dying.

01:46:15.251 --> 01:46:17.127
This will only take a moment.

01:46:40.151 --> 01:46:41.484
Hey, what's the matter, Clinch?

01:46:41.485 --> 01:46:43.153
You not feeling well?

01:46:43.154 --> 01:46:44.821
You okay, boss?

01:46:44.822 --> 01:46:46.656
What's happening to me?

01:46:46.657 --> 01:46:50.493
You know, there are a million
ways to die in the West, Clinch.

01:46:50.494 --> 01:46:53.830
There's, uh, famine,
disease, gunfights.

01:46:53.831 --> 01:46:57.417
And, uh, wild animals.
You know, like snakes.

01:46:57.418 --> 01:46:58.918
And, you know, the funny thing is,

01:46:58.919 --> 01:47:00.795
you don't even have to get bitten.

01:47:00.796 --> 01:47:02.589
All you need is a
little bit of the venom

01:47:02.590 --> 01:47:04.341
introduced into your bloodstream

01:47:04.342 --> 01:47:06.426
and you're pretty much screwed.

01:47:06.427 --> 01:47:09.346
<i>For example, if you drain
a certain amount of venom</i>

01:47:09.347 --> 01:47:11.765
<i>from the fangs of a diamondback
rattler into a hollow-tip bullet,</i>

01:47:11.766 --> 01:47:13.683
<i>you really only need one shot.</i>

01:47:13.684 --> 01:47:17.270
<i>Now, I knew my aim wasn't good enough
to hit you anywhere important.</i>

01:47:17.271 --> 01:47:19.356
<i>But if I caught you by surprise...</i>

01:47:19.357 --> 01:47:22.359
<i>Well, Anna taught me just enough
to get me in the ballpark.</i>

01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:24.778
And just a small amount
of venom in an open wound

01:47:24.779 --> 01:47:26.321
is enough to kill a man if he's...

01:47:26.322 --> 01:47:28.198
Albert.

01:47:28.199 --> 01:47:31.326
He's dead. You did it.

01:47:31.327 --> 01:47:32.494
Oh.

01:47:32.495 --> 01:47:33.995
Yeah.

01:47:33.996 --> 01:47:36.414
Did he hear all that
smart stuff I did?

01:47:36.415 --> 01:47:37.540
Uh...

01:47:37.541 --> 01:47:39.959
No. No, I don't think so.

01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:41.086
Oh.

01:47:41.087 --> 01:47:42.337
Well, it was still good, though.

01:47:42.338 --> 01:47:43.463
Yeah, it was great.

01:47:43.464 --> 01:47:45.256
I thought it was really good.

01:47:47.677 --> 01:47:48.802
Stop!

01:47:48.803 --> 01:47:51.504
Albert!

01:48:01.315 --> 01:48:02.565
I'm really horny right now.

01:48:03.818 --> 01:48:07.020
Let's go in the shade and fuck.

01:48:08.572 --> 01:48:10.156
Well done, sheep boy.

01:48:10.157 --> 01:48:12.367
Hey, sorry I killed your husband.

01:48:12.368 --> 01:48:14.911
Oh, God. That was never
gonna work out anyway.

01:48:14.912 --> 01:48:16.579
He's Methodist, I'm half-Jewish.

01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:19.082
- Are you? You are?
- No!

01:48:19.083 --> 01:48:20.333
Oh, thank God!

01:48:20.334 --> 01:48:22.411
- You're not really Arabic, are you?
- No, no, no.

01:48:22.412 --> 01:48:24.387
Oh, thank God. Because
I was like, "Ah, kill me!"

01:48:24.388 --> 01:48:26.256
I know, right? "No! Oh, my God!"

01:48:26.257 --> 01:48:29.459
- No, we're fine. We're okay.
- Albert!

01:48:29.593 --> 01:48:30.969
Hey, Louise.

01:48:30.970 --> 01:48:34.764
Hey. Listen, if you want to...

01:48:34.765 --> 01:48:38.810
If you want to talk about
things, I would like that.

01:48:38.811 --> 01:48:43.640
I mean, I could come by your
place, like, later tonight.

01:48:44.275 --> 01:48:45.942
You know, uh, Louise, I would,

01:48:45.943 --> 01:48:50.647
but I really gotta go
home and work on myself.

01:48:54.618 --> 01:48:56.745
So, you killed Clinch Leatherwood,

01:48:56.746 --> 01:48:59.289
the deadliest gunman
on the frontier.

01:48:59.290 --> 01:49:01.333
Yeah, I guess I did, huh?

01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:05.128
You know, there's probably
gonna be some reward money.

01:49:05.129 --> 01:49:07.964
You know, I didn't
think about that.

01:49:07.965 --> 01:49:11.084
What are you gonna do?

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.210
Step right up, folks.
Step right up!

01:49:45.211 --> 01:49:48.713
Who wants to take a gander
at the shooting gallery?

01:49:48.714 --> 01:49:51.541
I'll take a shot.

01:49:59.016 --> 01:50:00.975
People die at the fair.

01:55:37.355 --> 01:55:42.164
What the fuck? Somebody bring
me one of them white women.

01:55:43.305 --> 01:55:49.486
