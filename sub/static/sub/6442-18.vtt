00:36.300 --> 00:37.665
Chloe.

00:37.835 --> 00:39.962
Thought that was Gabe's car.

00:40.137 --> 00:44.938
-What a surprise. I haven't seen you since--
-Since my Dad was fired from the plant.

00:45.109 --> 00:46.804
-How's he doing?
-Hanging in there.

00:46.978 --> 00:50.914
I don't think he ever expected the human
resources shuffle this late in his career.

00:51.082 --> 00:53.175
He's a good man.
He'll land on his feet.

00:53.351 --> 00:57.219
Actually, he sent out dozens of resumes
and hasn't even gotten a nibble.

00:57.388 --> 00:59.515
I know this is beyond the call,
but Dad said...

00:59.690 --> 01:01.885
...you always kept your ear
close to the ground.

01:02.059 --> 01:04.994
You think somebody could be sabotaging
his chances at a new job?

01:05.162 --> 01:08.029
Chloe, you know
I'd do anything for Gabe...

01:08.399 --> 01:10.367
...but...

01:10.534 --> 01:14.197
...Lex is opening some projects
none of us want anything to do with.

01:15.006 --> 01:19.238
Trust me, your Dad would be better off
to put LuthorCorp far behind him.

03:09.520 --> 03:12.751
I need a decontamination
crew in Section 1 978.

03:19.029 --> 03:21.122
Send a security team.

03:43.888 --> 03:46.789
-There she is!
-Cover corridor C.

03:46.957 --> 03:48.288
You got it.

03:58.302 --> 04:00.065
Hold it right there!

04:10.347 --> 04:12.008
Hey, move it.

05:17.114 --> 05:20.948
Chloe, hey! Chloe.
I've been trying to break through...

05:21.118 --> 05:23.211
-...to planet Chloe for two halls now.
-Yeah.

05:23.387 --> 05:25.912
I guess I've had a lot on my mind.
Speaking of which....

05:26.090 --> 05:29.253
Tell me I can cross your
teacher-of-the-year interview off my list.

05:29.426 --> 05:32.293
Well, I called and I left a message,
but she didn't call back.

05:32.596 --> 05:35.190
Clark. Okay, Clark.

05:35.366 --> 05:39.462
I understand Mrs. Taylor is like Fort Knox
when it comes to her private life...

05:39.637 --> 05:43.437
...but journalism isn't sitting back,
waiting for someone to hand you the truth.

05:43.607 --> 05:46.599
Sometimes,
you have to actually work for it.

05:48.178 --> 05:52.239
And sometimes, timing is everything.
Okay, Clark.

05:52.416 --> 05:56.944
Now go. And remember,
"no comment" is not an option.

05:58.989 --> 06:02.618
Mrs. Taylor, I was wondering if we could
set a time for your Torch interview.

06:02.793 --> 06:04.158
It'll be painless, I promise.

06:04.328 --> 06:06.193
Actually, I'm really busy this week.

06:06.363 --> 06:08.991
Mrs. Taylor, 1 0 minutes. Tops.

06:09.166 --> 06:12.863
How about before lit class?
Does that work for you?

06:20.644 --> 06:23.545
No, I'm printing a pop quiz
because I watched TV last night...

06:23.714 --> 06:26.581
...instead of prepping for class.

06:35.559 --> 06:37.356
Did she really just say that?

06:44.401 --> 06:46.767
-Hey, Pete, are we still on for tonight?
-Oh, yeah.

06:46.937 --> 06:51.135
I gotta drop some stuff off for my mom,
but I should definitely be home for tip-off.

06:51.308 --> 06:54.072
Another lovely evening
huddled around the electronic hearth.

06:54.244 --> 06:56.735
Since Pete's supplying the big screen,
I got dinner.

06:57.181 --> 06:59.741
What? Clark Kent in the kitchen?

07:00.851 --> 07:02.682
What's on the menu?

07:03.754 --> 07:06.951
Clark's gonna run to Metropolis
to get Shark Dogs from the stadium.

07:08.092 --> 07:09.787
What? Whoa, whoa, back up.

07:09.960 --> 07:14.954
You mean to tell me that Clark is driving
six hours to pick up a couple of hot dogs?

07:15.399 --> 07:19.460
Well, when Clark goes supersonic,
he can make the roundtrip in 1 0 minutes.

07:24.074 --> 07:25.769
He's kidding.

07:29.546 --> 07:31.844
Come on, Pete, let's get to class.

07:37.020 --> 07:40.717
-What was that?
-lt just happened. I never meant to say that.

07:41.392 --> 07:43.223
I just had this urge to tell the truth.

07:43.394 --> 07:46.363
Well, next time you get the urge
to open up, don't.

07:59.510 --> 08:01.034
Lex.

08:01.612 --> 08:04.809
Thanks for dropping by.

08:04.982 --> 08:08.941
Which of your obsessive-compulsive
fixations is behind today's summons?

08:11.388 --> 08:14.516
I understand there was...

08:14.691 --> 08:19.025
...an incident at the Smallville plant
last night, correct?

08:19.663 --> 08:22.291
A false alarm in the old wing.

08:22.966 --> 08:24.797
Already taken care of it.

08:24.968 --> 08:26.697
By scrambling the HAZMAT team?

08:27.104 --> 08:28.731
Just a precaution.

08:28.906 --> 08:31.500
Or a wild overreaction.

08:32.643 --> 08:36.306
Unless, of course, a chemical agent
had actually been released.

08:46.590 --> 08:48.558
I'm curious, Dad.

08:49.259 --> 08:52.524
Why the sudden urge
to play micromanager?

08:53.564 --> 08:55.293
Because I'm concerned about you, Lex.

08:59.636 --> 09:03.265
You're not deliberately
concealing things from me...

09:04.274 --> 09:05.741
...are you?

09:09.847 --> 09:11.314
We all have our secrets.

09:56.493 --> 09:59.758
Okay, well, so far, we have
student accolades, testimonials....

09:59.930 --> 10:02.023
Everything except for Mrs. Taylor herself.

10:03.367 --> 10:06.859
Well, Chloe, if she doesn't want to talk,
maybe we should just let it go?

10:07.204 --> 10:08.637
Hi.

10:08.805 --> 10:11.137
-Oh, hi, Chloe.
-Hey, Mrs. Kent.

10:11.308 --> 10:14.641
-Are there more in the truck?
-Yes, sweetheart, thank you.

10:14.878 --> 10:18.336
I never got a chance to thank you
for the flowers after Jonathan's surgery.

10:18.515 --> 10:20.210
Of course.
How's he feeling?

10:21.285 --> 10:25.722
It's been really difficult.
He's depressed and angry.

10:26.623 --> 10:31.993
I worry that when he comes out of this,
he won't be the same man I married.

10:34.631 --> 10:36.098
I'm sorry.

10:36.733 --> 10:38.462
How's Clark handling all this?

10:38.769 --> 10:42.432
Of course, he feels responsible
for Jonathan's condition.

10:43.974 --> 10:46.772
How could he be responsible
for Mr. Kent's heart attack?

10:46.944 --> 10:50.880
It's not. It's his biological father's.
He's the one who drove Clark to Metropolis.

10:51.048 --> 10:52.515
Mom.

10:53.317 --> 10:54.875
Where do you want these?

10:57.387 --> 10:58.684
Clark...

10:58.855 --> 11:02.621
...you found your biological father,
and you didn't tell me about it?

11:07.631 --> 11:09.599
She meant figuratively.

11:10.133 --> 11:14.365
You know, coming to grips with the fact
that my real parents didn't want me...

11:16.073 --> 11:18.803
...played a part
in what happened last summer.

11:20.043 --> 11:21.374
Let's pick this up tomorrow.

11:22.846 --> 11:24.438
Okay.

11:27.985 --> 11:29.885
Bye.

11:31.788 --> 11:33.688
Bye.

11:38.528 --> 11:42.794
I can't believe I told Chloe about Jor-El.

11:43.934 --> 11:47.097
I don't-- I don't know what happened,
Clark.

11:47.270 --> 11:52.640
Mom, it's okay. I don't think it's just you.
I think something has happened to Chloe.

12:05.789 --> 12:07.347
Lana.

12:07.524 --> 12:08.752
Hope I'm not interrupting.

12:08.925 --> 12:11.587
No, I'm just finishing up
with the morning rush.

12:12.696 --> 12:15.187
I haven't seen you around
the last few days.

12:15.365 --> 12:18.459
I figured after our last conversation
you could use some space.

12:18.635 --> 12:23.163
I was thinking the same thing,
but we don't seem to be very good at that.

12:24.541 --> 12:26.941
It's hard to make yourself scarce
in Smallville.

12:32.082 --> 12:34.573
Actually, I'm here because of Chloe.

12:34.751 --> 12:37.219
Have you noticed anything
different about her?

12:41.625 --> 12:44.492
I don't want to cross
the roommate boundaries, but...

12:44.661 --> 12:47.129
...this guy called for her yesterday
when she was out.

12:47.297 --> 12:48.696
An old coworker of her dad's.

12:49.833 --> 12:52.825
-From LuthorCorp?
-Yeah, and he sounded really upset.

12:53.036 --> 12:55.800
He was wondering
if she had taken his security card.

12:56.707 --> 12:58.868
Klepto Chloe?

12:59.042 --> 13:00.407
That doesn't sound like her.

13:00.577 --> 13:05.571
He said whoever stole it broke into a lab
at the plant two nights ago.

13:20.897 --> 13:22.489
Mrs. Taylor?

13:22.666 --> 13:26.033
Hi, Mrs. Taylor. I'm sorry to be pulling
the 60 Minutes card...

13:26.203 --> 13:29.604
...but I'm crashing a deadline.
Can we just pop this off really quick?

13:29.973 --> 13:32.066
Only because you'll never let me
off the hook.

13:32.242 --> 13:34.938
It must be cool having
the best teacher in school as a mom.

13:35.112 --> 13:38.775
I'm used to her being the best
at everything she does.

13:38.949 --> 13:42.817
Okay. We'll just start with the obvious.
What do you like about teaching?

13:43.587 --> 13:44.815
I enjoy the students.

13:45.388 --> 13:47.083
Okay. Any downsides?

13:47.457 --> 13:49.755
Always having to hide the truth.

13:52.596 --> 13:55.030
I'm sorry.
The truth about what?

13:56.166 --> 13:58.634
That Mrs. Taylor doesn't exist.

14:00.270 --> 14:03.535
My real name is Marianne Lewis...

14:03.707 --> 14:07.336
...and I've been running from my past
since 1 972.

14:08.645 --> 14:11.205
I don't understand. What did you do?

14:11.948 --> 14:15.213
I was part of a radical group.

14:15.385 --> 14:19.344
We planted explosives
outside a bank in Seattle.

14:20.957 --> 14:23.653
We were just trying to make a statement.

14:24.294 --> 14:26.785
But one of the guards came in early...

14:26.963 --> 14:28.521
...and when the bomb went off....

14:30.767 --> 14:34.203
Mrs. Taylor, are you saying
you're wanted for murder?

14:37.574 --> 14:40.099
I just drove the car.

14:41.645 --> 14:45.479
I swear, I never meant for anyone to die.

14:46.383 --> 14:47.748
Mom, what are you saying?

14:48.218 --> 14:50.743
I should've told you this years ago.

14:56.126 --> 14:57.650
I'm so sorry.

14:57.828 --> 15:00.319
-Okay, Mrs. Taylor--
-No! Get away from her.

15:00.497 --> 15:03.523
Okay? Just leave us alone.
Come on.

15:03.867 --> 15:06.734
I'm so sorry, Willy.
I should have told you.

15:07.470 --> 15:09.665
I just couldn't make myself.

15:26.656 --> 15:30.592
Congratulations, Chloe. Within 24 hours,
you managed to tick off the entire school.

15:30.760 --> 15:32.990
You don't earn your
press pass by making friends.

15:33.163 --> 15:36.132
-Police should be handling this.
-Clark, I uncovered a murder.

15:36.299 --> 15:38.392
With your new ability.

15:38.568 --> 15:41.503
You broke into the LuthorCorp plant
the other night, didn't you?

15:41.671 --> 15:43.536
-Something happened?
-Wow.

15:43.707 --> 15:46.972
There may be some journalistic genes
behind those baby blues after all.

15:47.143 --> 15:50.806
People are telling you things they don't
want you to know. It's not a joke.

15:50.981 --> 15:53.916
No, but it is every reporter's dream.

15:55.385 --> 15:56.909
Rebecca.

15:57.087 --> 15:59.578
When the entire geometry class
got C's on the final...

15:59.756 --> 16:02.054
...how is it possible that you aced it?

16:02.225 --> 16:04.591
I swiped the answer key
the day before the test.

16:06.863 --> 16:09.832
You're not gonna tell anybody, are you?

16:14.738 --> 16:16.501
Mindy!

16:17.974 --> 16:19.942
Hey, Mindy.

16:20.110 --> 16:21.941
You're always so upbeat.

16:22.112 --> 16:23.511
Does anything bother you?

16:23.680 --> 16:27.639
Are you kidding? Do you have any idea
how hard it is to cheer for a losing team?

16:31.554 --> 16:33.749
Mindy, what are you talking about?

16:36.793 --> 16:40.126
Doug, if you could take anyone to prom,
who would you take?

16:42.165 --> 16:43.996
That would be Fitz.

16:46.536 --> 16:49.130
Thomas Fitzpatrick, the quarterback?

16:51.908 --> 16:54.536
Wow. I didn't expect that one.

16:54.844 --> 16:57.312
Hey, it's cool. It's off-the-record.

16:57.814 --> 16:59.611
My God, Clark, this is amazing!

16:59.783 --> 17:01.751
Can you imagine
the stories I could break?

17:01.918 --> 17:03.977
I could crack
the mystery that is Clark Kent.

17:06.723 --> 17:08.486
What do you keep hiding from me?

17:11.661 --> 17:13.127
I can't believe you asked that.

17:15.498 --> 17:17.227
And you didn't answer.

17:18.401 --> 17:20.130
Everyone else would have.

17:22.204 --> 17:24.230
What are you so afraid of, Clark?

17:25.108 --> 17:28.703
That I'll get behind that armor
and finally uncover your secret?

18:11.521 --> 18:15.082
Clark. Last time I checked,
this area is restricted.

18:15.792 --> 18:17.453
Hey, Lex.

18:18.361 --> 18:21.262
Sorry about just walking around.
The outside door was unlocked.

18:21.431 --> 18:24.059
Actually, it looked broken to me...

18:24.234 --> 18:26.429
...but I'll have a word
with my security people.

18:28.238 --> 18:30.468
Want to tell me why you're here?

18:30.640 --> 18:31.937
I'm worried about a friend.

18:32.409 --> 18:36.812
That friend wouldn't have happened
to break in a few nights ago, would they?

18:36.980 --> 18:38.675
Clark, why didn't you come to me?

18:39.983 --> 18:44.113
Last time I did that, I had my conversations
hand-delivered to the FBl.

18:44.287 --> 18:48.314
Clark, whatever deal I've made
with the feds, your family is off-limits.

18:50.727 --> 18:53.787
I was kind of hoping
you might return the favor.

18:53.963 --> 18:57.160
Now, you mind telling me
what you were doing down here?

18:58.134 --> 18:59.999
It wasn't me.

19:01.471 --> 19:05.168
Lex, there's something happening
to my friend, and....

19:05.608 --> 19:07.200
What were you working on down here?

19:07.377 --> 19:10.175
An old project of my father's.

19:10.346 --> 19:12.871
I was trying to salvage something
from his failure.

19:14.350 --> 19:15.578
Then where is everything?

19:16.986 --> 19:19.011
I decided to cut my losses.

19:20.056 --> 19:21.387
Clark...

19:21.858 --> 19:25.760
...we didn't get far enough
to gauge the potential side effects.

19:26.496 --> 19:31.092
If this friend was exposed to anything,
there could be a serious health risk.

19:32.402 --> 19:35.803
Now, it's hard for me to help
unless I know who it is.

19:47.650 --> 19:49.345
How could you print this?

19:49.519 --> 19:52.852
Thanks to you, my mom had to go
into hiding. Police are looking for her.

19:53.289 --> 19:58.693
I'm sorry, William, I just printed the truth.
I can't be held responsible for that.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.630
You ruined my life.

20:13.977 --> 20:17.777
Was it just me, or did I completely
clear out the lunch crowd?

20:17.947 --> 20:19.938
No, it was you.

20:22.418 --> 20:25.080
Ever since you turned the Torch
into your own gossip column...

20:25.255 --> 20:27.223
...no one can stand being around you.

20:28.091 --> 20:30.321
At least you're still talking to me, right?

20:31.194 --> 20:32.821
For now.

20:33.663 --> 20:36.928
Okay. What's that about?

20:39.636 --> 20:41.763
I applied to the Paris School of the Arts.

20:42.105 --> 20:47.304
They have a full-time high-school program,
and if I get accepted, I start in the summer.

20:50.246 --> 20:54.012
Wow. I guess I'm out of the loop.
When did you decide this?

20:55.151 --> 20:57.517
I've been thinking about it
for a while now.

20:58.588 --> 21:04.618
Everyone has their families, you know,
and I'm not sure where I fit in.

21:04.794 --> 21:08.252
-But I always thought we were your family.
-Oh, come on, Chloe.

21:08.431 --> 21:10.558
I know what you
and everyone else thinks of me.

21:10.733 --> 21:14.134
That I'm driven and self-involved.

21:15.638 --> 21:20.132
I just can't wait to get out of here and go
somewhere where people don't judge me.

21:23.413 --> 21:25.506
I never said anything like that.

21:26.349 --> 21:28.749
You never had to.

21:29.953 --> 21:32.478
Why have you never
talked to me about this?

21:34.591 --> 21:36.684
Because I couldn't trust you.

21:57.280 --> 21:58.872
Chloe, thanks for coming.

21:59.048 --> 22:00.572
Yeah, well, I only have a minute.

22:00.750 --> 22:03.947
Clark just called me about a story
that broke at the hospital, so....

22:04.120 --> 22:08.716
Then you can give me the abridged version
of your trip to LuthorCorp the other night.

22:09.626 --> 22:11.423
Let me guess...

22:11.594 --> 22:14.222
...somehow, no one can resist
telling you the truth.

22:15.298 --> 22:17.163
Are you looking for an apology?

22:17.367 --> 22:18.698
No.

22:18.868 --> 22:20.233
Chloe...

22:20.870 --> 22:25.034
...I want you to use your gift to help me
get back the weeks my father stole from me.

22:25.275 --> 22:29.735
I don't think your Dad would go to such
extremes to destroy those memories...

22:29.912 --> 22:32.312
...if they didn't pose
some sort of a threat to him.

22:32.482 --> 22:34.780
Maybe you should just leave it alone.

22:36.286 --> 22:40.347
Why do I get the feeling you know
more about this than you're letting on?

22:41.024 --> 22:42.753
I don't know anything about that.

22:42.925 --> 22:47.021
But I do know that because of you,
my dad can't get a job. Why help you?

22:47.196 --> 22:49.790
Because my father is the one
who ordered his dismissal.

22:54.971 --> 22:57.201
You know that's the truth, don't you?

23:01.511 --> 23:04.480
Meaning that my family's future
is just one chess move...

23:04.647 --> 23:07.980
...in the endless game of one-upmanship
played by you and your dad?

23:08.151 --> 23:09.846
It's not a game, Chloe.

23:10.019 --> 23:12.249
You're the only one
who can get me the truth.

23:14.057 --> 23:16.548
Why do you keep doing this to yourself?

23:17.760 --> 23:20.820
Why can't you just
walk away from your father?

23:22.398 --> 23:25.595
Because he won't give me
the only thing I've ever wanted from him.

23:26.402 --> 23:27.960
And that would be?

23:34.677 --> 23:37.009
I want him to love me.

23:56.432 --> 23:58.093
Pete. What are you doing here?

23:58.267 --> 23:59.928
Chloe said you had some big story.

24:00.103 --> 24:01.764
I just told her that.

24:01.938 --> 24:05.567
The way she's acting, I thought it was
the only way to get her to the hospital.

24:05.742 --> 24:07.209
Is she okay?

24:07.377 --> 24:09.811
She got doused with something.
It's making her sick.

24:09.979 --> 24:11.571
Some sort of truth gas.

24:11.748 --> 24:13.841
Which would explain
the vise grip on my arm.

24:16.919 --> 24:20.719
I can take a hint. You want me out of here
before the human lie detector shows up.

24:26.729 --> 24:30.256
-Hey, Pete.
-Chloe.

24:31.367 --> 24:33.961
No, wait.
Now, enough is enough.

24:34.137 --> 24:37.868
Everyone seems to be on the "run away
from Chloe" bandwagon today. Why you?

24:38.641 --> 24:42.168
I'm trying to stay away from you
so I don't tell you the truth.

24:42.345 --> 24:46.179
-Remember that story I called you about?
-Yeah, we can talk about this story later.

24:46.349 --> 24:49.978
Right now, I want to know why you guys
are playing such a zone defense on me.

24:50.286 --> 24:52.254
What is the big secret, Pete?

25:01.230 --> 25:03.289
I'm in love with you, Chloe.

25:04.267 --> 25:07.930
I've been waiting to do that
ever since the first day that I met you.

25:08.337 --> 25:10.066
Okay, whoa, Pete.

25:12.675 --> 25:14.267
Why didn't you tell me this sooner?

25:15.144 --> 25:17.612
Because I knew the way
you felt about Clark.

25:19.115 --> 25:20.844
And I never saw the point.

25:27.557 --> 25:29.787
-Pete, wait.
-Chloe, listen.

25:29.959 --> 25:34.055
If Clark's right and there's something
wrong with you, then take care of it.

25:34.230 --> 25:35.458
Please.

25:40.703 --> 25:43.001
Chloe? Are you okay?

25:43.439 --> 25:44.736
I need some help!

25:44.907 --> 25:46.568
Please!

25:47.343 --> 25:48.571
-What's her name?
-Chloe.

25:48.744 --> 25:51.144
Chloe, we're going
to take you down to Exam 3.

25:53.649 --> 25:57.642
You're gonna be okay.
Have you had anything to eat today?

25:58.287 --> 26:00.152
-Yeah, a little.
-When did you...?

26:07.063 --> 26:09.827
Clark, I've been looking for you.
They arrested Mrs. Taylor.

26:09.999 --> 26:12.331
I know. It's been all over the lnternet.

26:13.302 --> 26:17.796
So long as you're online, wanna ask Jeeves
how long it takes to die of embarrassment?

26:23.312 --> 26:26.679
Pete, how come you didn't
tell me how you felt about Chloe?

26:28.284 --> 26:30.275
It's not like I ever had a chance with her.

26:31.487 --> 26:34.888
-What would make you say that?
-Because I'm always standing next to you.

26:36.826 --> 26:39.260
Oh, come on, Clark.

26:40.096 --> 26:43.031
As far as long shadows go,
you're the dark side of the moon.

26:50.706 --> 26:53.971
-Why are you looking through Chloe's files?
-I'm worried about her.

26:54.143 --> 26:58.546
She was working on a story
about a LuthorCorp project called Levitas.

26:58.714 --> 27:01.205
This retired military doctor,
General Jonah Doyle...

27:01.384 --> 27:04.512
...claims he was part
of the first test five years ago.

27:04.687 --> 27:06.450
Sounds like a crackpot.

27:09.425 --> 27:11.484
It's our only lead.

27:20.403 --> 27:22.701
Everything looks normal.

27:23.105 --> 27:25.073
I'll be right back.

27:39.655 --> 27:41.623
-That wasn't very long.
-Miss Sullivan.

27:42.625 --> 27:44.456
You look a bit peaked.

27:44.794 --> 27:48.594
Well, I suppose a steady diet of truth
can wear on a person.

27:50.533 --> 27:54.697
I understand you've borrowed
one of our LuthorCorp security cards.

27:55.671 --> 27:57.764
I was just trying to help my dad.

27:57.940 --> 27:59.498
What did you do, blacklist him?

27:59.675 --> 28:04.908
You're damn right I blacklisted him.
He'll be lucky to find a job as a dishwasher.

28:08.618 --> 28:13.612
Well, I warned you there'd be repercussions
if you defied me. I'm a man of my word.

28:13.856 --> 28:16.222
There's only one way to find out.

28:17.693 --> 28:18.921
What?

28:19.095 --> 28:21.529
Did you order Morgan Edge
to kill your parents?

28:22.098 --> 28:24.464
Of course I did.
For their life insurance.

28:24.634 --> 28:26.659
I needed that money
to start my company.

28:31.273 --> 28:34.071
I'm sorry you asked me
that question, Miss Sullivan.

28:34.377 --> 28:37.073
That's very dangerous information
for you to have.

28:37.246 --> 28:39.043
Why did you ask me that?

28:41.183 --> 28:44.016
That's not important.
This is.

28:44.186 --> 28:46.086
Of course I did.
For their life insurance.

28:46.255 --> 28:48.985
I have your entire confession
recorded on my voice mail...

28:49.158 --> 28:51.649
...and the only person
that has the password is me.

28:51.827 --> 28:55.024
So if I were you, I would reconsider
my father's employment situation.

28:55.197 --> 28:59.657
I'm impressed, but unfortunately,
I don't respond to blackmail.

29:00.236 --> 29:03.535
But, you know, this isn't what's gonna get
your father's job back.

29:04.607 --> 29:06.404
-Then what would?
-lnformation...

29:06.575 --> 29:09.567
...from an especially intransigent source.

29:10.246 --> 29:11.577
Does this source have a name?

29:11.747 --> 29:13.977
Two, actually.
Jonathan and Martha Kent.

29:14.150 --> 29:15.947
But you need only ask one question.

29:16.118 --> 29:17.346
Why would I ever do that?

29:17.520 --> 29:21.115
Because I know you have a special place
in your heart for their son...

29:21.290 --> 29:24.054
...and it's killing you
that he's hiding something from you.

29:24.226 --> 29:27.787
And we both know that this may be
the only opportunity you'll ever have...

29:27.963 --> 29:30.454
...to find out what that is.

29:35.738 --> 29:38.468
And what exactly is it
that you want to know?

29:41.510 --> 29:44.377
Where did Clark Kent come from?

30:14.643 --> 30:16.873
You need a lesson in manners.

30:19.148 --> 30:22.083
I'm here to talk to you
about the Levitas project.

30:23.152 --> 30:26.485
I know that LuthorCorp was the contractor
when you were in charge.

30:26.655 --> 30:28.555
They've resumed the experiment.

30:29.058 --> 30:31.583
-Lionel Luthor send you?
-No.

30:31.761 --> 30:34.127
I need to know
how the drug affects people.

30:39.502 --> 30:40.799
Over there.

30:58.487 --> 31:01.388
We were trying to create
the ultimate interrogator.

31:01.690 --> 31:02.952
Why did you stop?

31:03.993 --> 31:06.291
I balked over safety issues.

31:07.363 --> 31:12.300
Luthor retaliated by arranging
for a disappointing psych report...

31:13.636 --> 31:16.196
...and a dishonorable discharge.

31:20.376 --> 31:23.345
Mr. Doyle, a friend of mine
stumbled into the LuthorCorp lab...

31:23.546 --> 31:26.174
...that was continuing
the Levitas research.

31:26.348 --> 31:27.815
I think she was exposed--

31:27.983 --> 31:29.541
Is your friend showing symptoms?

31:30.753 --> 31:32.084
She's been having headaches.

31:34.657 --> 31:36.921
My guess is your friend
will be dead by morning.

31:38.394 --> 31:42.387
-Dead?
-That's why I suspended the project.

31:43.766 --> 31:47.429
We suspected the gas would work.

31:51.574 --> 31:53.906
But the toxicity levels
were off the charts.

31:55.010 --> 31:56.944
Is there anything that can help her?

31:58.113 --> 32:02.311
Just before the project went down,
I was working on a possible counteractant.

32:09.391 --> 32:11.359
It was never tested.

32:22.204 --> 32:24.297
If I have to use this,
how much do I give her?

32:25.207 --> 32:28.438
Hit her with a full dose.
Right in the heart.

32:35.084 --> 32:37.552
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Chloe Sullivan.

32:37.720 --> 32:40.883
So are we. She left
without being officially discharged.

32:52.468 --> 32:54.959
-Clark. What a surprise.
-ls it?

32:55.971 --> 32:58.633
I know about your human truth serum.

32:58.941 --> 33:00.465
The Levitas project.

33:01.610 --> 33:03.407
Levitas...?

33:03.579 --> 33:09.518
Levita-- I think we abandoned
that project five, seven years ago.

33:10.386 --> 33:12.149
You're lying.

33:13.055 --> 33:17.287
That's a provocative accusation, Clark,
especially coming from you.

33:18.027 --> 33:20.996
I don't believe you're here
just to check on Chloe's health.

33:21.163 --> 33:25.361
Did you get her to work for you again?
Ask more questions about me?

33:25.534 --> 33:29.026
Whatever I ask her to do, Clark,
is in search of the truth.

33:30.873 --> 33:32.500
She might die.

33:35.277 --> 33:37.370
You couldn't care less.

33:43.819 --> 33:45.047
Come on.

34:00.869 --> 34:03.030
-Hello?
-Chloe, it's Clark.

34:03.205 --> 34:06.641
You have to get back to the hospital now.
What you have might kill you.

34:09.011 --> 34:11.241
You're just saying that
so you can stop me.

34:11.413 --> 34:13.472
Stop you from what?

34:13.882 --> 34:16.476
Do you know what it's like
to look at your best friend...

34:16.652 --> 34:18.016
...and know he is lying?

34:19.788 --> 34:21.255
I can't do this anymore.

34:25.226 --> 34:26.626
Chloe.

34:29.331 --> 34:30.992
Chloe, talk to me.

34:33.335 --> 34:36.168
Chloe! Are you all right, Chloe?
Talk to me.

34:36.338 --> 34:37.896
You have to let me help you.

34:59.028 --> 35:00.723
Chloe.

35:06.802 --> 35:08.702
I warned you to leave us alone!

35:08.871 --> 35:11.362
My mother doesn't deserve to be in jail!

35:15.611 --> 35:17.101
Chloe?

35:17.279 --> 35:20.407
Clark! Clark, I'm at the Coughlin Bridge!
Please help me!

36:59.581 --> 37:01.742
Chloe! It's gonna be okay.

37:14.229 --> 37:18.893
-Well, that's it. No need to call back.
-Two invitations to your office in one week.

37:19.067 --> 37:20.625
I should be flattered.

37:20.802 --> 37:22.531
You should be more careful.

37:23.505 --> 37:27.339
In the future, if you want to reactivate
one of my old projects...

37:27.509 --> 37:29.443
...son, all you have to do is ask.

37:29.611 --> 37:34.173
If you made more of an effort to keep me
informed, I wouldn't resort to subterfuge.

37:34.349 --> 37:39.810
I am trying to understand, Lex, why you
would be so desperate to learn the truth...

37:39.988 --> 37:44.550
...that you would resort
to using a dangerously unstable drug.

37:44.726 --> 37:47.456
I guess the truth
has never really held much merit for you.

37:48.964 --> 37:51.023
Now, I'm losing my patience, Lex.

37:51.200 --> 37:54.431
You are constantly defensive with me.

37:55.137 --> 37:58.231
Now, tell me, damn it,
what is it you want from me?

38:03.679 --> 38:05.670
It doesn't really matter, Dad.

38:06.548 --> 38:08.072
I'm never going to get it.

38:25.701 --> 38:27.760
Chloe, how are you feeling?

38:28.670 --> 38:30.228
A little shaky.

38:30.405 --> 38:32.270
But I'm totally truth-serum free.

38:32.641 --> 38:36.236
Whatever you Pulp Fiction-ed into my
chest not only kick-started my heart...

38:36.411 --> 38:39.312
...but also relieved me
of any Levitas in my system, so...

38:39.481 --> 38:41.108
...that's good.

38:44.953 --> 38:48.081
-Did you hear what happened to William?
-Yeah.

38:48.991 --> 38:51.755
Between his mother's past
and her arrest...

38:51.927 --> 38:53.758
...he took quite a hit.

38:56.431 --> 38:58.763
I never meant to hurt him.

38:59.368 --> 39:02.064
His mom's the one
who should've told him.

39:02.938 --> 39:05.031
But that's the thing about the truth.

39:05.941 --> 39:08.375
It's bound to come out, sooner or later.

39:11.913 --> 39:14.108
Then I guess it's my turn to come clean.

39:16.618 --> 39:19.883
When you found me on the bridge,
I was on my way here.

39:21.823 --> 39:25.782
I was gonna ask your parents
all the questions you would never answer.

39:33.902 --> 39:35.460
Look...

39:35.637 --> 39:39.368
...I know "I'm sorry" has become
a recurring motif in our relationship, but--

39:39.541 --> 39:40.838
No, Chloe....

39:41.576 --> 39:44.010
I appreciate your honesty,
but you weren't yourself.

39:45.514 --> 39:47.880
I really wish I could believe that.

39:48.684 --> 39:52.313
But there have been so many times
my curiosity has gotten the best of me.

39:53.689 --> 39:57.318
-Maybe this is just who I am.
-No. You're going after the truth.

39:57.492 --> 39:58.823
Nothing wrong with that.

39:58.994 --> 40:01.986
Unless it hurts the people
you care the most about.

40:03.598 --> 40:06.123
I'm just afraid that one day
I'm gonna push too hard...

40:06.301 --> 40:08.895
...and I'm not going to get
the chance to say I'm sorry.

40:13.342 --> 40:15.242
Today's not that day.

40:32.461 --> 40:35.089
Clark. Thanks for coming by.

40:35.263 --> 40:38.630
Is everything okay? I haven't gotten
many phone messages from you lately.

40:38.800 --> 40:41.030
Yeah.

40:43.638 --> 40:45.629
I've been wanting to show you this.

40:46.775 --> 40:48.265
Paris?

40:48.443 --> 40:50.377
I sent in my application last week.

40:52.914 --> 40:54.142
I don't understand.

40:56.084 --> 40:58.018
I'm leaving.

41:01.990 --> 41:04.424
-Lana, if this is because of me--
-No.

41:04.593 --> 41:06.220
No.

41:06.495 --> 41:08.190
Because of everything.

41:08.363 --> 41:11.560
I'm beginning to feel like
I need a fresh start.

41:11.733 --> 41:14.099
What about your life here?
What about your friends?

41:14.970 --> 41:18.872
Well, maybe I'll wind up
in Smallville eventually, but...

41:19.040 --> 41:24.171
...I don't think I can be happy, wondering
if there's something else out there.

41:28.517 --> 41:30.348
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

41:30.519 --> 41:32.487
Because...

41:33.188 --> 41:35.452
...I didn't want anyone
to talk me out of it.

41:38.627 --> 41:40.822
And the truth is...

41:40.996 --> 41:43.430
...I knew you were
the only person that could.

42:10.459 --> 42:14.725

Hello, Miss Sullivan. It's only me.

42:22.804 --> 42:25.637
Oh, no need to look
for that conversation we had earlier.

42:25.807 --> 42:28.867
That's gone, and....

42:29.044 --> 42:31.638
Well, that's it. No need to call back.

42:31.847 --> 42:34.577
You have no more messages.
