00:23.640 --> 00:28.760
Oh, God. Three months on this rock,
and I still can't get a decent cup of coffee.

00:28.840 --> 00:31.400
Core sample analysis coming in,
but so far,

00:31.480 --> 00:35.360
the highest concentration
is 2.3 parts per million.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.440
2.3 parts.

00:37.520 --> 00:42.040
Major Lorne, we need enough
naqahdah to manufacture 303s.

00:42.120 --> 00:45.280
- You know how big a battle cruiser is?
- It's pretty big, sir.

00:45.360 --> 00:48.960
If we start mining these deposits
right now, today,

00:49.040 --> 00:54.920
your great-grandchildren're still gonna be
trying to pull out enough ore to make one.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.360
Colonel Edwards?

00:57.440 --> 01:00.960
- Menard.
- Latest analysis shows a concentration

01:01.040 --> 01:06.000
50 times higher than anything we've seen
so far. It's increasing as we go deeper.

01:06.080 --> 01:08.520
This could be the one, sir.

01:09.320 --> 01:15.400
Yeah. If this pans out, your
great-grandchildren might be off the hook.

01:15.480 --> 01:17.680
Yes, sir.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.920
<i>(snarling)</i>

01:36.720 --> 01:38.520
<i>(rustling)</i>

01:50.240 --> 01:52.240
<i>(snarling)</i>

02:00.240 --> 02:02.240
<i>(growling)</i>

02:08.039 --> 02:10.039
<i>(screams)</i>

03:12.040 --> 03:14.040
Colonel Edwards?

03:16.040 --> 03:21.200
I'm glad you're here, Jack. Ritter's
been missing now for three hours.

03:21.280 --> 03:25.920
- I assume he has a compass and a radio.
- The planet has strange magnetic traits,

03:26.000 --> 03:29.840
which make a compass useless
and limit the range of our radios.

03:29.920 --> 03:35.120
We need him back, now that we may have
found a significant deposit of naqahdah.

03:35.200 --> 03:39.240
- How significant?
- We won't know until after our analysis.

03:39.320 --> 03:42.920
The Pentagon wants battle cruisers
and F-302s. We find the rocks.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.960
- And we find the rock... finders.
- There you have it.

03:48.040 --> 03:51.000
Major Lorne will show you
where Ritter was last seen.

03:51.080 --> 03:53.080
If you'll follow me.

03:55.560 --> 03:57.680
What's this?

04:02.400 --> 04:05.080
- Artefacts?
- Yes.

04:05.160 --> 04:09.800
- You found all this and didn't contact me?
- We were going to.

04:09.880 --> 04:13.360
- They've been moved.
- Well, they were in the way.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.400
Daniel.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.800
Go to your happy place.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.680
Go.

04:29.960 --> 04:33.120
Lieutenant Ritter was mapping
the surrounding area.

04:33.200 --> 04:37.720
When he didn't show up for chow, we got
worried and went out looking for him, sir.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.960
Sent up flares, hoped he'd see 'em,
get his bearings.

04:41.040 --> 04:45.320
Is it normal for guys
to wander away from camp?

04:45.400 --> 04:50.680
He might have been placing markers.
Multiple sightings, you get turned around.

04:51.440 --> 04:54.680
- Teal'c?
- The ground is extremely firm, O'Neill.

04:54.760 --> 04:57.040
- No tracks?
- Not in the immediate area.

04:57.120 --> 05:01.680
But there is damage to the underbrush
moving off in several different directions.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.720
<i>(Daniel) Jack, come in.</i>

05:03.800 --> 05:05.560
Yeah. Go ahead.

05:05.640 --> 05:09.120
<i>(speech muffled by static)</i>

05:09.200 --> 05:11.520
I'm not reading you. Say again.

05:11.600 --> 05:15.200
<i>I said I've got something here
you need to see.</i>

05:15.280 --> 05:17.080
All right, on my way.

05:17.160 --> 05:19.600
You guys keep looking. I'll be back.

05:26.120 --> 05:28.600
- What you got?
- Mostly mining equipment.

05:28.680 --> 05:33.280
Could be several hundred years old.
Hard to date it till I get it back to the SGC.

05:33.360 --> 05:36.440
- Remember these?
- Ever so fondly.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.520
- Still has power.
- Just keeps going and going.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.680
I want to show you
the truly fascinating part.

05:45.760 --> 05:51.480
It's a yoke, capable of pulling great
weight. It predates the harness on Earth.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.600
- Fascinating. Truly.
- I was getting to that part.

05:54.680 --> 05:57.080
It's too big, too heavy.

05:57.160 --> 06:00.280
- Meaning?
- It wasn't made for a human being.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.440
- Who was it made for?
- It's too small for an animal.

06:03.520 --> 06:07.440
Based on what I know about the Goa'uld,
I'd say it was made for an Unas.

06:07.520 --> 06:10.240
The Goa'uld used the Unas
as slaves before humans.

06:10.320 --> 06:14.240
They're predominantly cave dwellers
and can work in harsh environments -

06:14.320 --> 06:19.320
- perfect labour for this kind of mining.
- This day just gets better and better.

06:19.400 --> 06:20.800
Teal'c, come in.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.040
Proceed, O'Neill.

06:24.120 --> 06:26.320
<i>- Find anything?
- We have not.</i>

06:26.400 --> 06:30.840
Heads up. Daniel just found evidence
an Unas might have been in the area.

06:34.440 --> 06:36.440
Acknowledged.

06:40.520 --> 06:45.240
You want me to delay this operation
because you found a shoulder harness...

06:45.320 --> 06:48.320
- Yoke, actually.
- ..that could be built for a creature

06:48.400 --> 06:51.720
that probably disappeared
or died off a long time ago?

06:51.800 --> 06:55.320
The Goa'uld left slaves behind
once they lost interest in a planet.

06:55.400 --> 06:59.120
In three months we haven't seen
anything like what you describe.

06:59.200 --> 07:04.400
- Maybe that's the way they want it.
- Doctor, the Pentagon wants results.

07:04.480 --> 07:08.840
You don't understand. Unas are territorial,
and when provoked can be dangerous.

07:08.920 --> 07:12.160
- Is he always like this?
- Yeah, pretty much.

07:12.240 --> 07:16.320
If they are here, do you think they had
anything to do with Ritter gone missing?

07:16.400 --> 07:18.520
Yes, I do.

07:18.600 --> 07:21.000
I'm not closing down this operation,

07:21.080 --> 07:27.040
but I do think we should bring in
some extra troops, help secure the area.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.560
What is it?

07:43.640 --> 07:49.640
The Unas wear these to prevent the
Goa'uld from burrowing into their necks.

08:04.160 --> 08:09.360
I believe these figures
are intended as a warning to stay away.

08:32.159 --> 08:34.159
Lieutenant Ritter.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.640
<i>(retches)</i>

08:49.240 --> 08:52.760
All right! I want extra ammo for everyone.

08:52.840 --> 08:56.280
Keep your eyes open
and stay in radio contact.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.960
What are you intending to do?

08:59.920 --> 09:03.920
These things killed one of my men
and strung him up like a scarecrow.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.040
- What the hell do you think I intend to do?
- You may have provoked them.

09:08.120 --> 09:13.120
We didn't even know they were here. How
the hell could we have provoked them?

09:13.200 --> 09:17.920
If the mine extends as far as you estimate,
then this other entrance is in the network.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.760
It's an alternate entrance
to the same mine.

09:20.840 --> 09:24.280
It has to be something
about this area, this mine.

09:24.360 --> 09:28.400
- They don't want us here.
- The feeling's mutual.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.640
Jack?

09:30.720 --> 09:32.240
Look,

09:32.320 --> 09:35.600
I know he can be a little...

09:35.680 --> 09:38.160
but he's usually right about this stuff.

09:38.240 --> 09:42.600
My orders are to determine the potential
of this site as a mining operation.

09:42.680 --> 09:47.120
Until those orders are rescinded,
I will ensure the safety of my people.

09:47.200 --> 09:51.440
So, are you gonna help me
secure this area or not?

10:00.320 --> 10:03.320
- This is a mistake.
- It's his command, Daniel.

10:03.400 --> 10:07.120
He's never encountered the Unas.
He doesn't know what he's dealing with.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.200
<i>(shouting, gunfire)</i>

10:13.920 --> 10:16.120
<i>(roaring)</i>

10:17.720 --> 10:19.200
Argh!

10:33.240 --> 10:34.760
Aaagh!

10:51.960 --> 10:53.400
<i>(growls)</i>

10:54.600 --> 10:56.720
Ka Keka!

10:56.800 --> 10:59.080
Ka Keka!

11:00.680 --> 11:03.080
Ska nat?

11:03.160 --> 11:05.120
Ka Ko Keka?

11:09.280 --> 11:10.840
Benna!

11:10.920 --> 11:12.760
Benna Ka Cha!

11:15.120 --> 11:17.600
Benna Ka Cha!

11:28.720 --> 11:30.720
Help him. Help him.

11:37.880 --> 11:42.160
My men'll take care of the wounded.
They're on the run. Let's take 'em now.

11:42.240 --> 11:44.000
<i>(distant wailing)</i>

11:44.080 --> 11:48.960
- What's that? What are they doing now?
- They're mourning their dead.

11:49.040 --> 11:52.800
This may be our best chance.
We're not gonna let 'em get away, are we?

11:52.880 --> 11:55.520
We won't pursue an enemy
into unknown terrain.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.880
You think they're capable of tactics?

11:57.960 --> 12:01.360
We know them. They're
far more intelligent than you think.

12:01.440 --> 12:04.120
I don't care. They attacked us.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.240
Edwards, we're not going in!

12:06.320 --> 12:09.920
This is my command.
You are here at my request.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.280
- You're in charge of a mining operation.
- Your standing orders no longer apply.

12:14.360 --> 12:18.040
Let's take it back to SGC
and we'll figure it out there.

12:18.120 --> 12:19.920
Fine.

12:28.480 --> 12:29.960
Ow! God!

12:30.040 --> 12:32.440
Get away.

12:36.720 --> 12:40.040
- How's the arm?
- Good.

12:40.120 --> 12:42.880
How's the science project?

12:42.960 --> 12:45.960
You mean my overhaul
of the gate diagnostic system?

12:46.040 --> 12:49.880
- I guess that's what I mean.
- It's going well, sir. Thank you for asking.

12:49.960 --> 12:55.480
If we go back to this planet,
you're not coming with us, are you?

12:55.560 --> 12:58.880
- It's doubtful.
- Yeah, that's too bad.

12:58.960 --> 13:02.280
I was hoping
you'd take command of the mission.

13:02.360 --> 13:05.120
Colonel Edwards
has no experience with the Unas.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.200
Nor you.

13:09.200 --> 13:12.240
He's an OK guy, Daniel.
He's just under a lot of pressure.

13:12.800 --> 13:16.520
Yeah. Yeah. I guess I just spent
a lot of time breaking you in.

13:16.600 --> 13:20.360
I just didn't want to
have to start with a new colonel.

13:20.440 --> 13:22.920
It'll be fine.

13:26.080 --> 13:29.360
Just try not to be so...

13:31.400 --> 13:34.560
- What?
- Oh, you know.

13:38.160 --> 13:41.600
<i>(groans and sighs)</i>

13:44.160 --> 13:46.920
Colonel, General Vidrine
is down from the Pentagon.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.320
He's been put in charge of
BC-303 production.

13:50.400 --> 13:54.880
We've read your report, Colonel, and we
agree that the evacuation was warranted.

13:54.960 --> 13:58.640
<i>Unfortunately, with the Prometheus
stranded across the galaxy,</i>

13:58.720 --> 14:02.080
Earth is currently vulnerable
to orbital attack.

14:02.160 --> 14:06.880
If someone can show me another way
to acquire naqahdah, I'm listening.

14:06.960 --> 14:10.040
Otherwise, we've got to
go back to P3X-403.

14:10.120 --> 14:13.960
With enough men and firepower,
I can take care of your problem, sir.

14:14.040 --> 14:17.440
We've dealt with these creatures before,

14:17.520 --> 14:20.960
and I can guarantee you
it won't be as easy as you think.

14:21.040 --> 14:24.960
Be that as it may, the Pentagon's
position is quite clear on this.

14:25.040 --> 14:28.880
Colonel Edwards will return to the planet
and begin mining operations.

14:28.960 --> 14:32.440
SG personnel will provide security
on a continuing basis.

14:32.520 --> 14:35.160
- If this leads to hostilities...
- It will.

14:36.400 --> 14:41.160
Dr Jackson, I don't believe
you were invited to this meeting.

14:41.240 --> 14:45.760
Yes, General, I know.
I'm sorry, but please hear me out.

14:45.840 --> 14:49.280
- The situation can be resolved peacefully.
- How?

14:49.360 --> 14:51.680
We've been on this planet a long time.

14:51.760 --> 14:55.960
It wasn't until we encroached on
this one region that the Unas attacked.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.840
Can't we just mine
away from this one area?

14:58.920 --> 15:03.080
All the other mine sites we've surveyed
have been void of significant deposits.

15:03.160 --> 15:07.720
This is the only site we've found thus far
that might satisfy production quotas.

15:07.800 --> 15:11.320
- And if this leads to another dead end?
- Then we won't have a problem,

15:11.400 --> 15:14.880
but I'm not going to walk away from this
until I know for sure.

15:14.960 --> 15:18.480
Then can we at least
try to negotiate with them?

15:18.560 --> 15:21.960
- They're animals, sir.
- They are not. They are intelligent.

15:22.040 --> 15:24.320
If you underestimate them, more will die.

15:24.400 --> 15:27.120
Who would negotiate on our behalf? You?

15:27.200 --> 15:31.240
I have a limited vocabulary and a
rudimentary understanding of their ways,

15:31.320 --> 15:34.440
but this has gone too far
for me to handle myself.

15:34.520 --> 15:38.840
- What are you proposing, Doctor?
- I suggest we use Chaka as a liaison.

15:38.920 --> 15:41.720
- Chaka?
- An Unas we met on a different planet.

15:41.800 --> 15:46.560
I've had contact with him. He's made
progress in his understanding of us.

15:46.640 --> 15:50.480
We've interacted with these beings before
and lived. Chaka saved my life.

15:50.560 --> 15:55.440
This is their planet. We're the invaders.
We don't have to provoke or kill them.

15:55.520 --> 15:59.400
- I'm sure no one wants that, Dr Jackson.
- Yes, I'm sure.

15:59.480 --> 16:03.680
If talks are resolved in the time allotted
to determine the viability of the mine,

16:03.760 --> 16:06.600
you're giving up nothing by letting him try.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.400
All right. Proceed.

16:10.480 --> 16:15.440
Dr Jackson, you'll contact Chaka
and return him here without delay.

16:15.520 --> 16:18.600
<i>(Vidrine) One more thing,
so that there's no confusion.</i>

16:18.680 --> 16:23.320
If negotiations fail
and it comes down to us or them,

16:23.400 --> 16:25.400
I choose us.

16:26.280 --> 16:29.480
The use of deadly force is authorised.

16:39.520 --> 16:42.800
IDC received, sir.
Dr Jackson, plus one.

16:42.880 --> 16:45.000
Open the iris.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.400
Stand down.

17:00.480 --> 17:04.440
Chaka's never been in
a structure like this before.

17:12.960 --> 17:14.960
<i>- Um...
- (snarls)</i>

17:18.000 --> 17:19.400
A Cha' Aka.

17:20.160 --> 17:24.359
"A Cha' Aka" is a greeting.
In this case, he's saying hello.

17:25.800 --> 17:28.119
'Ell... o.

17:28.760 --> 17:30.160
Pfft.

17:32.240 --> 17:34.040
Pfft.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.440
Um, I've had a chance to talk with Chaka.

17:36.520 --> 17:39.360
He's managed to accomplish
some remarkable things.

17:39.440 --> 17:43.680
On the planet where Chaka lives humans
used Unas as domesticated slaves,

17:43.760 --> 17:47.800
- but Chaka led an uprising, and...
- You neglected to mention this before.

17:47.880 --> 17:50.160
How many were killed in this uprising?

17:50.240 --> 17:54.800
That's not the point. Chaka brokered
a truce and established a fragile peace

17:54.880 --> 17:57.920
between the humans and Unas
who were formerly their slaves.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.800
If he managed to do this,

17:59.880 --> 18:03.640
I know he could act as a peaceful liaison
between us and the Unas of P3X-403.

18:03.720 --> 18:08.200
- Does he even want to help us?
- I've informed him of what we need to do.

18:08.280 --> 18:11.040
He's eager to meet Unas of other worlds.

18:11.120 --> 18:13.120

while we were gone.</i>

18:36.000 --> 18:38.120
You're right, Dr Jackson.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.760
They're much more advanced
than what I thought.

18:41.840 --> 18:44.640
They have command of fire.

18:44.720 --> 18:48.320
Major Lorne,
as soon as this place is cleaned up,

18:48.400 --> 18:54.200
I want you to begin a resonance scan
analysis of the lower mine shafts.

18:55.440 --> 18:58.280
How do you intend
to find these Unas, Doctor?

18:58.360 --> 19:01.440
I think Chaka will lead us to them.

Colonel, he knows you don't like him.

19:20.920 --> 19:25.320
Keep staring at him like that,
he's gonna take it as a challenge.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.640
Chaka, Ka Kreeka.

19:38.080 --> 19:40.840
Just keep him away from me.

19:42.840 --> 19:46.800
Hanson, Penhall, you're with them.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.680
The rest of you,
I want this perimeter secured.

19:49.760 --> 19:53.680
Antipersonnel and
overlapping fields of fire. Move it!

19:53.760 --> 19:58.120
- He's getting ready for a war.
- He's responsible for protecting his camp.

19:58.200 --> 20:01.800
Yeah, or he's looking for revenge
for Lieutenant Ritter.

20:24.280 --> 20:26.680
'Uman tatack?

20:27.160 --> 20:29.440
Ka. No. We're not gonna attack.

20:31.120 --> 20:33.360
'Uman tatack.

20:33.440 --> 20:36.400
He says our weapons
and the size of our group create fear.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.000
It seems like we intend to attack.

20:39.080 --> 20:43.120
Ka. Dan'el, Chaka Ka cha.

20:43.200 --> 20:46.360

<i>- (Teal'c) You will be helpless.
- I'll be all right.</i>

20:51.320 --> 20:54.640
- This is unwise.
- We can't make contact if they fear us.

20:54.720 --> 20:57.320
Are you certain?

20:58.320 --> 21:01.600
Yeah. Yeah, I'm... I'm certain.

21:34.880 --> 21:40.680
Staff weapons, torture sticks, manacles -
symbols of pain and death.

21:43.240 --> 21:47.040
Chaka? Here, got a new toy.

26:29.720 --> 26:31.520
All right.

26:31.600 --> 26:33.600
Now we're talking, huh?

26:37.720 --> 26:39.560
Dr Jackson, how'd it go?

26:39.640 --> 26:43.640
I figured out why they attacked us.
It's this mine. It's sacred to them.

26:43.720 --> 26:49.040
Their ancestors were worked to death
by the Goa'uld while they were mining it.

26:49.120 --> 26:51.560
I said I'd speak to my superiors
on their behalf.

26:51.640 --> 26:56.040
Burial sites are protected on Earth. Those
rules should apply here. We have to leave.

26:56.120 --> 26:58.600
We got the results of the resonance scan.

26:58.680 --> 27:04.480
The deposit is over 300 metres in length
and almost completely solid.

27:07.160 --> 27:09.480
53,000 metric tons.

27:09.560 --> 27:11.680
We're not going anywhere.

27:18.760 --> 27:20.840
<i>My meeting with the Unas went well.</i>

27:20.920 --> 27:23.880
<i>They're reluctant to trust us,
but we're communicating.</i>

27:23.960 --> 27:28.840
<i>- How many of them are there?
- I only saw a medium-sized clan. Why?</i>

27:28.920 --> 27:32.680
We need to know
if we're going to relocate them.

27:32.760 --> 27:35.760
<i>They'll never accept it, sir.
They won't understand it.</i>

27:35.840 --> 27:38.240
Then it's your job
to make them understand.

27:38.320 --> 27:42.680
If you don't, we'll have to go in there
with tranquillisers and capture them.

27:42.760 --> 27:46.480
<i>They're not animals. I'm sure
Chaka and I can accomplish something.</i>

27:46.560 --> 27:49.160
<i>Just let me go talk to them again.</i>

27:49.240 --> 27:52.920
You have 24 hours
to convince the Unas to come peacefully,

27:53.000 --> 27:55.680
or they'll be forcibly removed.

28:03.920 --> 28:06.480

You treat them with respect and you'll
find out what kind of allies they can be.
