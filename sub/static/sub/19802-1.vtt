00:40.564 --> 00:41.999
Mya!

00:46.169 --> 00:48.038
Holy crap.

01:12.830 --> 01:14.665
Who is she?

01:16.593 --> 01:20.973
What is the history behind
this magnificent sculpture...

01:21.073 --> 01:23.942
...recently unearthed
on the plains of Arizona...

01:24.042 --> 01:26.912
...in the arid lands of the Navajo Nation?

01:27.612 --> 01:29.480
How old is she?

01:29.880 --> 01:34.386
She, it, does not conform to any
known remnants of Navajo history.

01:34.486 --> 01:40.158
And the tools needed to construct her
suggest a civilization previously unknown.

01:40.258 --> 01:46.102
One that may have existed
before the dawn of known history.

01:46.597 --> 01:50.034
And with your generous commitment...

01:50.834 --> 01:53.872
...we will hopefully unlock
this beautiful enigma...

01:53.972 --> 01:56.850
...and find out what secrets she has hidden.

01:59.410 --> 02:01.280
Are there any questions?

02:02.180 --> 02:06.651
The young lady in the corner.
Miss Sharon Christine Turner, I believe.

02:06.851 --> 02:08.519
Scout.

02:08.619 --> 02:09.803
Scout.

02:10.704 --> 02:13.325
Any plans for tonight, Professor Allen?

02:15.225 --> 02:18.129
- I'm so glad you asked that.
- I'm glad you're glad.

02:18.229 --> 02:22.200
- Because I have very important plans.
- I'm very intrigued.

02:22.300 --> 02:26.556
As you should be, because
they are surprisingly devised...

02:26.656 --> 02:30.508
...very cleverly with you as the focal point.

02:30.608 --> 02:34.792
I am surprised and intrigued.
Please elaborate.

02:35.612 --> 02:37.500
They are...

02:37.900 --> 02:40.918
...to wine, dine...

02:41.463 --> 02:45.015
- ...and just perhaps seduce.
- Just perhaps.

02:45.115 --> 02:50.027
My most trusted colleague,
Miss Sharon Christine Turner.

02:50.861 --> 02:52.396
Scout.

02:52.529 --> 02:54.065
Scout.

02:55.999 --> 02:58.036
I like, I like.

02:58.136 --> 03:00.771
Really? Which part?

03:04.941 --> 03:08.012
The dine part. This girl is starving.

03:08.112 --> 03:09.647
Yeah?

03:12.482 --> 03:15.653
- So, what do you think?
- Sushi.

03:15.753 --> 03:17.274
No...

03:17.774 --> 03:21.693
...about our little show and tell.
You think it'll get them excited?

03:21.793 --> 03:23.495
- Make 'em cough green?
- Yeah.

03:23.595 --> 03:29.033
No problem. How could they refuse
someone so irresistibly lickable?

03:35.872 --> 03:37.876
I am truly irresistible.

03:39.442 --> 03:43.214
But you've got to change that part
about hopefully discovering the truth.

03:43.314 --> 03:45.750
- How so?
- To we will discover the truth.

03:45.850 --> 03:49.253
- Be positive, young man.
- No can do, my gal.

03:49.353 --> 03:53.157
- You know us serious academic types.
- Like you?

03:53.857 --> 03:55.692
Like me.

03:56.093 --> 03:58.130
Can't make those kinds of promises.

03:59.230 --> 04:02.667
Then what kind can you promise me,
Professor Daniel Allen?

04:03.534 --> 04:05.570
Oh, serious time now?

04:05.970 --> 04:07.504
Maybe.

04:09.138 --> 04:10.673
Okay.

04:13.576 --> 04:16.798
I, Daniel Allen...

04:16.898 --> 04:20.944
...promise to Scout that I will forever...

04:26.657 --> 04:29.927
- Be saved by the bell.
- Only reprieved.

04:30.027 --> 04:31.862
Hey, Bryan.

04:32.996 --> 04:34.232
<i>Danny.</i>

04:34.332 --> 04:37.969
You calling me from your
big deal secret location?

04:38.369 --> 04:40.438
- <i>That I am, my man.</i>
- And is this the call...

04:40.538 --> 04:42.974
...the holy shit one you promised me?

04:43.911 --> 04:48.616
No, <i>amigo</i>, no. This is the call saying
that holy shit's not happening tonight.

04:48.716 --> 04:52.886
I'm starting to think that just maybe you
don't have that world changing discovery...

04:52.986 --> 04:55.419
...that's going to finally put you on top.

04:55.519 --> 04:58.556
No, no, it's for real.
Okay, no stop to the top.

04:58.656 --> 05:00.758
- Don't you doubt that.
- <i>Oh, I won't.</i>

05:00.858 --> 05:02.835
- Cool.
- <i>For now.</i>

05:02.935 --> 05:05.363
Trust me, it's way bigger
than your mystery woman statue.

05:05.463 --> 05:08.499
- So you say.
- So I say.

05:08.599 --> 05:10.182
But...

05:10.824 --> 05:15.040
...there's been a delay, all right?
It's outta my hands. Sorry. Okay?

05:15.140 --> 05:17.508
Yeah, but I'm still starting to doubt you.

05:17.642 --> 05:19.844
It'll be worth the wait, pal. I promise you.

05:19.944 --> 05:22.329
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

05:22.429 --> 05:25.950
Yeah, you might want
to be watching CNN tonight.

05:26.050 --> 05:27.551
Really?

05:27.851 --> 05:29.353
<i>Really.</i>

05:30.253 --> 05:32.456
Okay. Might.

05:32.556 --> 05:34.425
Take care, Bryan.

05:35.558 --> 05:38.563
Carter. Calling from who-knows-where.

05:39.163 --> 05:41.265
- About who-knows-what?
- Yep.

05:41.365 --> 05:44.902
- Still trying to outshine you?
- Yeah, maybe.

05:45.302 --> 05:48.272
But now, we can directly proceed...

05:48.372 --> 05:52.309
...to the wine, dine, and seduce.

05:52.409 --> 05:54.614
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

06:02.420 --> 06:06.560
It's the greatest discovery
since... man went to the moon.

06:06.660 --> 06:08.942
Shit, shit, that sucks.

06:09.426 --> 06:10.991
Asshole.

06:11.261 --> 06:15.266
Okay, all right, something better,
something better.

06:15.766 --> 06:17.522
Don't be a fool, be cool.

06:22.472 --> 06:23.341
Hi.

06:23.441 --> 06:26.444
And a big hi right back at you, Mr. Carter.

06:26.544 --> 06:30.634
Yeah. Sorry, I was expecting someone else.

06:30.734 --> 06:33.284
I know. The alphabet boys.

06:33.384 --> 06:35.785
ABC, NBC, CNN.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.924
- Yeah, kinda.
- Please don't be embarrassed.

06:40.024 --> 06:41.993
I completely understand.

06:42.293 --> 06:45.104
But before you get your 15 minutes...

06:45.204 --> 06:49.468
I would... we... were sent to
make sure that your incredible...

06:50.568 --> 06:52.460
- Discovery.
- Discovery, thank you...

06:52.560 --> 06:54.706
...is what you say it is.

06:54.806 --> 06:59.243
- No offense, I hope.
- No, not at all, none taken, none taken.

06:59.343 --> 07:02.372
I'd probably do the same
if somebody told me they had a...

07:03.562 --> 07:06.483
- ...but it's for real.
- I certainly hope so.

07:06.583 --> 07:09.920
No doubt whatsoever. As crazy
and as whacked out as it sounds...

07:10.020 --> 07:12.621
...I mean, this is
the genuine article, Mr....

07:12.721 --> 07:15.559
Kontral. But Richard, please.

07:15.659 --> 07:19.322
And this is Nicole, my facilitator.

07:19.963 --> 07:22.265
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:23.166 --> 07:25.937
All right, Richard, right this way.

07:26.037 --> 07:30.307
Right this way to the greatest discovery
since microwave popcorn.

07:31.041 --> 07:32.091
Shit.

07:39.816 --> 07:41.819
That is wonderful.

07:42.485 --> 07:44.956
Alphabet time now, Richard?

07:47.724 --> 07:51.395
So we had to... we had to cut
away about 2,000 tons of ore...

07:51.495 --> 07:54.497
...when they, I... I found it.

07:55.065 --> 07:57.001
See, I at first thought
it was just a new strata...

07:57.101 --> 08:00.942
...but when I got closer and saw
what those taco boys were digging up...

08:01.042 --> 08:04.041
- I made them clear out fast.
- Good for you, Bryan.

08:04.141 --> 08:08.546
Yeah, yeah, there's no way I want them
chattering away about this.

08:10.013 --> 08:11.682
Nor would I.

08:11.782 --> 08:14.351
Look at it. Doesn't it look brand new?

08:14.451 --> 08:16.688
Like it could have been made yesterday.

08:17.188 --> 08:18.990
It does indeed.

08:19.090 --> 08:20.925
There's not a scratch on it.

08:21.925 --> 08:24.929
- It's gotta be over 14,000 years old.
- Really?

08:25.029 --> 08:26.863
14,000.

08:27.397 --> 08:29.733
How on earth would you know that?

08:29.833 --> 08:32.703
Well, age of the ore around it.

08:32.803 --> 08:35.673
That's when the geog... geologists...

08:35.773 --> 08:38.008
...think it collapsed on it.

08:39.308 --> 08:42.113
And look, these hieroglyphics.

08:42.413 --> 08:45.683
That's not any language I've ever seen.

08:46.183 --> 08:48.052
That is incredible.

08:49.386 --> 08:53.758
You think that's incredible?
Wait 'til you hear the most incredible part.

08:53.858 --> 08:55.893
You know what I think we got here?

08:55.993 --> 08:58.663
The suspense is killing me, Bryan.

09:01.531 --> 09:04.969
This isn't some old Indian piece of junk. No.

09:05.069 --> 09:08.506
What we've got here is an alien spaceship.

09:08.606 --> 09:13.445
An ancient alien spaceship. I'm talking
chariots of the fucking gods here, Richard!

09:15.445 --> 09:18.283
And you know something,
I think it's still working.

09:19.483 --> 09:21.317
Feel it.

09:26.406 --> 09:28.432
Feel the power inside?

09:29.526 --> 09:31.328
The sucker's alive.

09:32.629 --> 09:34.097
Perhaps.

09:34.197 --> 09:38.969
It is, it is and not just from this whatever.

09:42.205 --> 09:44.076
The whole area...

09:45.083 --> 09:47.978
- ...is vibrating.
- Really?

09:57.053 --> 09:59.257
You know, I believe you're correct.

09:59.757 --> 10:01.591
Damn right.

10:04.027 --> 10:06.097
Damn right you are.

10:06.397 --> 10:07.841
Nicole.

10:07.998 --> 10:09.818
If it is...

10:09.918 --> 10:12.937
...if it is, do you know what this means?

10:13.037 --> 10:15.706
Do you have any idea what this means?

10:23.347 --> 10:25.383
I know what this means.

10:27.717 --> 10:28.819
What a goofball.

10:28.919 --> 10:32.136
Don't you ever make light
of taking a human life again, Nicole.

10:32.236 --> 10:36.060
You know how I feel about that.
What you've just done is horrible.

10:39.762 --> 10:41.565
But necessary.

10:42.832 --> 10:46.703
Your next priority is make sure no one else
understands the true nature of this...

10:48.806 --> 10:51.475
Just a moment, just a moment.

10:56.296 --> 10:59.315
Patience, patience.

11:00.783 --> 11:03.854
I'll soon unlock your secrets.

11:15.632 --> 11:18.085
And with your generous commitment...

11:18.285 --> 11:20.938
...we will unlock this beautiful enigma.

11:21.038 --> 11:23.466
Perfect. They're going
to be coughing green...

11:23.566 --> 11:25.808
...now that you went
with my brilliant suggestions.

11:25.908 --> 11:28.479
Well, a guy will agree to just
about anything after a great...

11:28.579 --> 11:31.381
- Dinner?
- Dinner.

11:34.217 --> 11:37.622
How's that for a dramatic opening image?

11:39.489 --> 11:42.460
It is kind of cool, isn't it?

11:42.560 --> 11:44.832
Maybe, if we knew what it was.

11:44.932 --> 11:48.259
- And who you are.
- A legitimate request, Miss Turner.

11:48.899 --> 11:52.357
- I'm Richard Kontral.
- And Richard Kontral is?

11:52.457 --> 11:56.940
Just a well-paid messenger boy
for some very liquid guys.

11:57.473 --> 12:00.944
- And they are?
- Of no matter right now.

12:01.044 --> 12:04.312
What does matter is that they might
just have had the good fortune...

12:04.412 --> 12:08.451
...to come across
a most incredible discovery?

12:09.252 --> 12:14.457
- And that's it?
- This is a very small part of it.

12:15.158 --> 12:18.496
Part of something that's very, very old.

12:18.596 --> 12:20.931
And by very, very old you mean?

12:21.031 --> 12:24.180
Over 14,000 years old.

12:32.175 --> 12:34.945
- 14,000 years, that's...
- Pre-history.

12:35.045 --> 12:37.348
Well, known history at any rate.

12:37.448 --> 12:41.318
Well, let's just say well before
that overrated sphinx...

12:41.418 --> 12:45.193
...would become a gleam
in the eyes of its primitive creator.

12:47.223 --> 12:50.828
What do you want from Profess... us?

12:50.928 --> 12:54.098
To help me figure out
what the hell this thing is...

12:54.198 --> 12:57.267
...and what message
it's trying to send us from...

12:58.267 --> 13:00.160
Over the river of time?

13:01.704 --> 13:03.773
Nicely put.

13:04.874 --> 13:08.467
And how, Miss Turner, would you like
to join us on a wondrous journey...

13:08.567 --> 13:11.582
...along that mysterious river?

13:16.853 --> 13:18.655
It's beautiful.

13:26.496 --> 13:28.999
I had no idea that its surface, was so...

13:29.099 --> 13:30.533
Perfect.

13:32.034 --> 13:34.872
- Crafted, sculpted, with tools...
- Unknown.

13:35.072 --> 13:40.044
Exactly. That's... that's why
I wanted you to actually see it.

13:40.144 --> 13:43.981
To understand. Not just view it digitally.

13:45.948 --> 13:48.986
- Good thinking.
- That's what I do.

13:49.786 --> 13:51.654
That's the way I am.

13:51.754 --> 13:57.261
And you two will help me translate
what these writings actually mean...

13:57.361 --> 13:59.636
...if indeed writings is what they are.

13:59.736 --> 14:01.832
- In all likelihood.
- That's what we do.

14:01.932 --> 14:04.368
We're going to need textural
laser scans of the surface.

14:04.468 --> 14:07.037
Of course. I've already ordered them.

14:07.137 --> 14:09.689
- That's what you do.
- Great.

14:12.408 --> 14:15.579
Daniel, look at this. The top part of this...

14:15.679 --> 14:18.048
- ...whatever, it's the same as...
- This.

14:20.416 --> 14:23.320
Yes, indeed. I hadn't noticed that.

14:23.420 --> 14:25.689
Well done, Miss Turner.

14:25.989 --> 14:29.126
So that would mean
that buried below this is...

14:29.226 --> 14:31.695
A vehicle from the stars.

14:33.563 --> 14:35.299
Chariot of the gods.

14:35.399 --> 14:39.136
- Holy crap.
- My sentiments exactly.

14:39.236 --> 14:42.473
Okay, let's not get ahead of ourselves
here. That's a pretty big leap.

14:42.573 --> 14:45.042
Perhaps, but I think not.

14:45.942 --> 14:48.345
- Why wouldn't you try to uncover it?
- Yeah, dig it up?

14:48.445 --> 14:51.682
I will, Miss Turner. I most certainly will.

14:51.782 --> 14:53.951
But discretion above all.

14:54.051 --> 14:57.427
It's waited 14,000 years,
it can wait a little while longer...

14:57.527 --> 15:00.090
...at least as long
as it takes to tell its story.

15:00.190 --> 15:03.060
And that, of course, is your assignment.

15:03.160 --> 15:04.785
- That's...
- What we do.

15:04.885 --> 15:06.430
Not exactly.

15:06.530 --> 15:10.634
What we do is translate the writings
of ancient cultures, human cultures.

15:10.734 --> 15:14.805
- But something from another world.
- Not much different.

15:16.939 --> 15:19.510
- We'll try our...
- Make it happen.

15:19.610 --> 15:21.478
I know you will.

15:21.978 --> 15:24.543
Yeah, sure.

15:28.818 --> 15:31.255
What wonders will you reveal?

15:33.756 --> 15:36.300
Why are you also here, mystery woman?

15:48.137 --> 15:50.006
Scout, you okay?

15:52.042 --> 15:53.576
Yeah.

15:53.843 --> 15:55.646
You sure?

15:57.013 --> 15:58.648
Totally.

16:01.017 --> 16:02.552
Okay.

16:53.095 --> 16:55.105
Not from the stars.

16:56.205 --> 16:58.475
From our forgotten past.

17:05.347 --> 17:07.384
Hey, hon, what you doing?

17:10.953 --> 17:14.424
- Scout?
- Daniel, I know the key.

17:15.259 --> 17:18.429
- To understanding, translating these...
- Alien writings?

17:18.529 --> 17:22.098
- They're not.
- They're not what?

17:22.199 --> 17:26.470
Alien. It's not a chariot
of the gods that Kontral's found.

17:26.569 --> 17:29.746
- Not an alien spacecraft?
- No.

17:29.846 --> 17:32.096
They were created by humans.

17:33.109 --> 17:35.978
- From Earth?
- Yes.

17:36.746 --> 17:38.886
And they left us a message.

17:39.496 --> 17:40.905
Well...

17:41.305 --> 17:43.728
...let's see if we can translate it then.

17:44.854 --> 17:46.657
That's what we do.

17:57.400 --> 17:59.454
Not from the stars...

18:00.352 --> 18:02.414
...from our forgotten past.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.670
You ready? The driver should be here.

18:33.770 --> 18:37.574
- It's almost time.
- To kiss off all we've done?

18:37.674 --> 18:40.511
- Now what is that supposed to mean?
- Nothing. Never mind.

18:40.611 --> 18:43.847
Come on, don't be that way now, okay?

18:44.747 --> 18:47.985
- I am what I am.
- The woman I love.

18:49.690 --> 18:51.822
The woman who figured out the translations.

18:51.922 --> 18:53.724
And the woman who's now acting fucking weird.

18:53.824 --> 18:57.294
- You should have stopped at number two.
- But I am what I am.

18:58.427 --> 19:01.134
Hey, guys, your ride's here.

19:01.464 --> 19:03.400
Thanks, Eli. Your timing was perfect.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.899
A really decadent stretch limo.

19:07.336 --> 19:09.290
Does it have crystal glassware?

19:16.812 --> 19:19.483
- Eyes wide shut.
- Keep your clothes on.

19:19.583 --> 19:20.944
I'll try.

19:24.887 --> 19:29.892
Not an alien ship from some
other world as we suspected...

19:29.992 --> 19:34.948
...but rather a vessel constructed
by an ancient, very human...

19:35.048 --> 19:38.217
...and long forgotten civilization.

19:39.301 --> 19:43.627
Now, even though the details
of this startling conclusion...

19:43.727 --> 19:46.610
...have been transmitted to you,
I thought it beneficial...

19:46.710 --> 19:50.135
...for you to meet the people responsible
for so brilliantly translating...

19:50.235 --> 19:52.288
...these ancient writings.

19:52.582 --> 19:56.489
Dr. Daniel Allen and Miss Sharon Turner.

19:56.819 --> 19:59.823
- Thank you, Mr. Kontral.
- Oh, please, Richard.

19:59.923 --> 20:02.994
- Good afternoon, everyone.
- Good afternoon.

20:03.994 --> 20:07.214
Contrary to Richard's very
kind words about our work...

20:07.314 --> 20:11.118
...the etchings proved, because
of Miss Turner's intuition...

20:11.218 --> 20:14.671
- ...to be extremely simple to decipher.
- Ray Charles could have done it.

20:14.771 --> 20:19.872
Well, not quite that simple,
but with today's high speed computers...

20:19.972 --> 20:23.280
...translations of unknown codes
and languages are much easier.

20:23.380 --> 20:26.083
There's no need for a Rosetta Stone.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.819
You both are quite humble.

20:28.919 --> 20:32.088
- He is, I'm not.
- True.

20:32.188 --> 20:34.224
But they were created,
intentionally designed...

20:34.324 --> 20:38.361
...so that any reasonably intelligent
culture could read them.

20:38.461 --> 20:42.599
- And learn.
- Which is the translation in your report?

20:42.699 --> 20:46.470
Yes, but that's only the surface meaning.

20:46.570 --> 20:49.887
- I don't understand.
- Well, we've determined...

20:49.987 --> 20:54.177
...that there are hints
to the real attitude and dialect of the...

20:54.277 --> 20:57.948
...the story teller beyond that
of the literal translation.

20:58.048 --> 21:00.750
- And Miss Turner...
- Scout.

21:00.850 --> 21:02.652
Thank you.

21:03.219 --> 21:07.057
Has created, composed
a draft in which I believe...

21:07.157 --> 21:11.061
...is the true character
of the ancient historian.

21:11.161 --> 21:14.598
She has revealed the emotional content.

21:14.698 --> 21:16.933
Really? You can do that?

21:17.033 --> 21:19.102
I can. That's what I do.

21:19.202 --> 21:21.872
Then please do so, Scout.

21:29.879 --> 21:33.150
This world has been ours
for countless millennia...

21:33.250 --> 21:36.052
...ruled under the benevolent bloodline of...

21:36.152 --> 21:40.557
...a name I can't translate,
but now approached destruction.

21:41.991 --> 21:46.830
He refused to allow the cosmos to erase
all that he has so wonderfully created.

21:48.298 --> 21:51.901
He is our Lord God, my lover...

21:53.102 --> 21:56.373
...and through his mighty strength
wished to forge a new world...

21:56.673 --> 21:59.042
...a continuing destiny for his people.

21:59.142 --> 22:02.344
He tasked me to complete
his vision and I have failed...

22:02.444 --> 22:04.881
...unable to return to where he waited.

22:04.981 --> 22:08.384
For those who may rise again
along this river of time...

22:08.484 --> 22:10.495
...I have inscribed his name...

22:11.095 --> 22:13.308
...for eternity to remember...

22:15.171 --> 22:17.033
...our Lord God.

22:21.991 --> 22:23.667
A love letter.

22:23.767 --> 22:27.202
- In a way, I suppose.
- It is.

22:28.037 --> 22:30.240
From across the river of time.

22:30.440 --> 22:34.044
- Surprisingly romantic.
- And enigmatic.

22:34.144 --> 22:36.346
Yes, very.

22:37.679 --> 22:39.983
What else do you know
about this ancient culture?

22:40.083 --> 22:42.786
- Zip. But with your...
- That's all.

22:42.886 --> 22:45.555
And the craft buried below the etchings?

22:45.655 --> 22:49.326
- Nothing. Richard wouldn't allow us.
- You have all the information.

22:49.426 --> 22:52.963
And we believe it is a fantastic mystery.

22:53.063 --> 22:57.899
One that I... we... want to, can solve.

22:59.869 --> 23:02.272
I understand your desire but...

23:02.372 --> 23:03.473
But?

23:03.573 --> 23:07.577
But your assignment has now been
fulfilled brilliantly and completely.

23:07.677 --> 23:10.471
You have our thanks and the considerable
fee that will soon be deposited...

23:10.571 --> 23:11.982
...in your accounts.

23:12.082 --> 23:14.551
- Now it's time for others to continue.
- I totally disagree.

23:14.651 --> 23:18.939
We're the ones who did all this research
and we can continue this project.

23:20.156 --> 23:21.491
Again, thank you.

23:21.591 --> 23:24.227
- Hey, come on.
- Easy there.

23:24.860 --> 23:26.984
- Mr. Kontral?
- Yes?

23:27.084 --> 23:29.832
It would now be appropriate for you to...

23:31.201 --> 23:33.035
Jesus, Scout.

23:33.335 --> 23:35.571
Still here, Eli. Talk later.

23:36.671 --> 23:40.275
With everything we've learned, it makes
perfect sense for us to continue...

23:40.375 --> 23:41.544
...to see this project through.

23:41.644 --> 23:44.447
Your service is greatly appreciated,
Miss Turner.

23:44.547 --> 23:48.118
- But it is now over.
- You do understand that?

23:48.218 --> 23:52.422
- Yes, we understand our agreement but we...
- But we're the most qualified.

23:52.522 --> 23:55.926
We will soon be in communication
again with you.

23:56.026 --> 23:59.296
- Very soon.
- I think we should talk now.

23:59.796 --> 24:01.131
Goodbye.

24:01.231 --> 24:05.201
- Oh, come on. This is ridic...
- Goodbye. For now.

24:05.301 --> 24:07.136
Come on.

24:07.403 --> 24:10.139
Yeah, okay. See ya around.

25:08.697 --> 25:10.566
Celebration time?

25:11.100 --> 25:12.569
Yeah, sure.

25:12.669 --> 25:15.138
I need a drink but not to celebrate.

25:16.273 --> 25:19.175
That doesn't sound so great. What happened?

25:19.275 --> 25:21.845
Nothing. It went mostly fine.

25:21.945 --> 25:24.848
- Fine?
- Can we not do this now?

25:24.948 --> 25:28.752
We turned in our report, were patted
on our heads, and told to hit the road.

25:28.852 --> 25:30.895
That's not exactly what happened.

25:30.995 --> 25:34.090
Oh, really? Then tell me what did.

25:35.124 --> 25:37.227
We wrapped up our job.

25:37.327 --> 25:38.661
Our job?

25:38.761 --> 25:42.499
The one we agreed to do
and get paid for. Our job.

25:42.599 --> 25:47.231
So, discovering, interpreting,
what could potentially change the world...

25:47.331 --> 25:49.706
...change the world, that's just a job?

25:49.806 --> 25:51.641
Change the world?

25:52.508 --> 25:55.111
- I know the world should be changed.
- It needs to be changed.

25:55.211 --> 25:58.014
But saying this discovery could is extreme.

25:58.114 --> 25:59.963
No, it isn't, Daniel.

26:00.063 --> 26:03.586
If what we've found out was made public,
then everyone's beliefs in reality...

26:03.686 --> 26:06.522
- ...in history, would transform.
- Maybe.

26:06.622 --> 26:08.901
No maybe. You know I'm right about this.

26:09.001 --> 26:10.761
- Fine, you're right.
- Thank you, professor.

26:10.861 --> 26:14.572
But are you sure you're not pissed just
because we might not be getting credit?

26:16.432 --> 26:18.268
Yeah, that's me, all right.

26:18.368 --> 26:21.538
My goal's always been to be
interviewed by fake news.

26:22.338 --> 26:24.206
I'm sorry.

26:25.007 --> 26:26.543
I know that's not you.

26:27.343 --> 26:28.978
Apology accepted.

26:36.552 --> 26:38.588
Okay, I'm listening.

26:39.688 --> 26:41.224
Tell us what you want us to do.

26:41.324 --> 26:44.794
Daniel, I just want us to somehow
follow this through.

26:44.894 --> 26:48.832
I just want to find out who really wrote
those inscriptions. Why did she risk so...

26:48.932 --> 26:51.267
- If it was a she.
- It was.

26:51.367 --> 26:57.374
Why did she risk so much for her Lord God
and her world of 14,000 years ago?

26:57.874 --> 27:00.943
A world that was much more advanced than now.

27:01.043 --> 27:03.479
- That's also kind of major, isn't it?
- Yes.

27:03.579 --> 27:04.833
And what happened to them?

27:04.933 --> 27:08.555
- Why, how, did their civilization vanish?
- That's a good question.

27:08.655 --> 27:12.016
And why aren't we being allowed
to search for the answers?

27:12.116 --> 27:13.356
I don't know.

27:13.456 --> 27:16.960
And no clue as to what Kontral's bosses
are planning on doing next.

27:17.060 --> 27:19.195
- True.
- I mean, who are those guys anyway?

27:19.295 --> 27:21.998
They certainly didn't make me
feel especially warm and fuzzy.

27:22.098 --> 27:23.532
Same.

27:25.267 --> 27:26.802
So?

27:30.639 --> 27:33.743
Fuck 'em, we go public.

27:33.843 --> 27:34.711
Yes.

27:34.811 --> 27:37.113
Right, we tell the world.
We give fake that interview.

27:37.413 --> 27:42.085
That is why you are still
the man and I love, you know.

27:42.185 --> 27:44.186
- I do.
- Yeah.

27:46.388 --> 27:49.425
- Ready for that drink?
- Yes, to celebrate.

27:49.525 --> 27:52.361
- Agreed.
- All right.

27:54.863 --> 27:56.932
Oh, crap.

27:57.035 --> 27:59.169
What's wrong with the... can you help me?

27:59.269 --> 28:00.870
- Okay.
- No, Scout.

28:00.970 --> 28:02.834
Oh, sure.

28:09.378 --> 28:12.188
- You know you drive me nuts.
- That's my job.

28:16.885 --> 28:18.687
Crazy kids.

28:23.393 --> 28:25.461
Hey, it's interview time.

28:34.930 --> 28:36.926
Hello, handsome.

28:48.250 --> 28:50.520
My God, what happened?

28:50.620 --> 28:54.890
Dr. Allen, Miss Turner.
Are you all right? Are you okay?

29:11.506 --> 29:13.719
Guess we'll do this the fun way.

29:57.386 --> 30:01.317
- Ready to proceed?
- Definitely, showtime.

30:01.723 --> 30:02.724
Resolution?

30:02.824 --> 30:06.493
It's not gonna moisten Halo's pants,
but it's kickin'.

30:06.863 --> 30:08.631
I'll take that as a good.

30:08.731 --> 30:13.002
548 ultra, ultra sensitive
suckers kissing it.

30:13.102 --> 30:17.406
Feeding into this hungry maxi gig baby.

30:17.506 --> 30:19.275
Yeah, it's killer good.

30:19.375 --> 30:22.377
- Just get on with the tour, please.
- Going in.

30:22.945 --> 30:27.981
Now, the images are pretty accurate
but what we're seeing is anybody's guess.

30:30.051 --> 30:33.289
Something bad coming up. Bonus points.

30:33.389 --> 30:37.126
- Zoom in and enhance.
- Aye, captain.

30:37.459 --> 30:38.928
We're going in.

30:41.030 --> 30:42.482
Holy crap.

30:42.582 --> 30:44.801
Get more detail on that.

30:45.401 --> 30:46.969
We're at max.

30:47.069 --> 30:50.073
Another piece to the puzzle.

30:50.173 --> 30:52.421
A Rubik's cube.

30:53.408 --> 30:55.645
An appropriate analogy.

31:26.175 --> 31:27.544
- Mr. Kontral.
- What is it?

31:27.644 --> 31:29.935
I'd like to show you something, sir.

31:36.219 --> 31:39.389
Zero effect. Like a diamond.

31:39.489 --> 31:42.892
- Denser. Infinitely.
- Now that's interesting.

31:42.992 --> 31:47.096
It would take something nuclear tipped
to break this baby apart.

31:47.196 --> 31:49.899
Well, that's never out of the question.

31:49.999 --> 31:52.602
- You can do that?
- You have no idea what I can do.

31:52.702 --> 31:54.555
- Shit.
- But then we'd lose...

31:54.655 --> 31:57.640
...our little discovery wouldn't we,
if I went all Strangelove on it?

31:57.740 --> 32:02.212
And I do so want to know
what secrets you contain.

32:02.312 --> 32:04.581
Kontral, you are one supreme prick.

32:04.681 --> 32:07.050
That's an understatement, Scout.

32:07.150 --> 32:09.569
- And he's sitting on...
- The discovery of the century.

32:09.669 --> 32:11.988
Another understatement.

32:12.088 --> 32:16.789
Then I suggest, sir, that you decide
what you want to do ASAP.

32:17.592 --> 32:19.762
You do? And why is that?

32:19.862 --> 32:24.667
Our sensors are indicating increased,
growing activity inside.

32:24.767 --> 32:27.603
Circuits, engines, something is starting up.

32:27.703 --> 32:29.639
- It's reactivating?
- Yes.

32:29.739 --> 32:31.074
That's interesting.

32:31.174 --> 32:33.644
And I think it's getting ready to take off.

32:34.444 --> 32:37.680
Now, after waiting 14,000 years?

32:37.780 --> 32:41.150
My guess is that it was covered
under tons of ore that buried it.

32:41.250 --> 32:45.988
And when we scraped it off, something
inside said it could now break free.

32:46.088 --> 32:47.690
Well, can it?

32:47.790 --> 32:50.966
I have no idea of knowing its power but...

32:51.066 --> 32:53.463
...I'm pretty damn sure
that's what it's preparing to do.

32:53.563 --> 32:56.466
Well, we're just going to have
to change its plans, aren't we?

32:56.566 --> 32:58.468
You're the boss.

32:58.568 --> 33:00.435
Yes, I am.

33:10.245 --> 33:13.516
- <i>Doctor Allen, I presume.</i>
- Crap.

33:13.816 --> 33:15.684
Stay down.

33:17.386 --> 33:19.555
It's time for the world to know, Kontral.

33:19.655 --> 33:24.863
Now why on Earth would you come
to that conclusion? Nicole.

33:25.510 --> 33:27.213
Lock on and execute.

33:37.372 --> 33:38.528
No!

33:40.742 --> 33:42.611
I'm sorry.

33:42.878 --> 33:45.681
I couldn't finish our job.

33:48.184 --> 33:50.397
Oh, no!

33:58.093 --> 34:00.561
Hey, hey.

34:01.296 --> 34:04.756
It's okay. It's okay. It's just a dream.

34:05.734 --> 34:09.338
- Death and destruction.
- That's a worry.

34:09.438 --> 34:12.141
Everything was burning
and I couldn't stop it.

34:12.241 --> 34:15.411
It's okay. It was just a dream.

34:15.511 --> 34:17.045
Remember?

34:17.512 --> 34:21.317
- Yeah, sorry, sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

34:22.284 --> 34:26.321
- It was really scary.
- Yeah, I figured that.

34:29.491 --> 34:31.360
You're so smart.

34:34.228 --> 34:36.031
And lovable.

34:36.130 --> 34:37.933
Just barely.

34:38.833 --> 34:40.803
Can you hold me?

34:40.902 --> 34:42.771
If I must.

34:48.110 --> 34:49.744
Feel good?

34:49.844 --> 34:51.679
It does.

34:52.013 --> 34:54.016
Mission accomplished.

34:55.784 --> 34:59.555
<i>Remember, we are God's creation.</i>

34:59.655 --> 35:04.433
<i>And the creator of all has placed
his divine instructions in the scriptures...</i>

35:04.533 --> 35:07.497
<i>...telling us, no, instructing us...</i>

35:07.597 --> 35:10.890
<i>...that it is our right, our destiny...</i>

35:10.990 --> 35:16.639
<i>...to enrich ourselves from the world's
limitless ever plentiful resources.</i>

35:17.139 --> 35:18.973
<i>We must...</i>

35:19.508 --> 35:23.579
This is where you should be.
Good food and good people.

35:24.512 --> 35:27.283
- Thank you.
- You're quite welcome.

35:27.383 --> 35:30.818
Now promise me you'll find
your way home. Okay?

35:30.918 --> 35:32.754
God bless you.

35:33.922 --> 35:35.757
You too.

35:36.425 --> 35:40.996
<i>Sharon Turner, 22, is being sought
for the brutal murder of Daniel Allen.</i>

35:41.096 --> 35:44.404
<i>Allen's charred and dismembered body
was discovered late last night...</i>

35:44.504 --> 35:47.536
<i>...by firefighters in his Oak Palm apartment.</i>

35:47.636 --> 35:51.083
<i>Allen and Turner were reported to
have been romantically involved...</i>

35:51.183 --> 35:54.811
<i>...and that Allen had repeatedly
tried to end their affair.</i>

36:09.391 --> 36:12.629
You can't occupy a booth
without ordering something.

36:13.779 --> 36:14.894
Coffee.

36:20.201 --> 36:22.005
I didn't order that.

36:22.505 --> 36:25.674
No coffee for you. No coffee period.

36:25.774 --> 36:30.246
Fucking spill by the fucking upstream
chem plant contaminated the town's water.

36:30.346 --> 36:32.648
My idiot boss should close the place.

36:32.748 --> 36:34.543
Bad news.

36:34.643 --> 36:38.654
Yeah. Anyway, you need this more than coffee.

36:38.754 --> 36:41.791
It's no charge. You look like crap.

36:41.891 --> 36:44.976
Thanks, for the sundae.

36:45.076 --> 36:47.930
No big deal. Nobody orders dessert anymore.

36:48.030 --> 36:51.533
- It's like a world gone mad.
- Yeah.

36:51.633 --> 36:53.635
Do you need a job?

36:54.169 --> 36:56.604
No, I'm okay.

36:56.771 --> 36:58.307
Yeah, right.

36:58.407 --> 37:01.911
Look, if they ever clean up this water mess,
they're gonna need help here.

37:02.011 --> 37:05.815
It's not too shitty once the owner gets
the message you're not going to blow him.

37:05.915 --> 37:07.716
No, really.

37:08.116 --> 37:09.651
Okay.

37:13.288 --> 37:14.823
Snot.

37:16.548 --> 37:18.076
Yeah.

37:21.462 --> 37:23.066
Tears.

37:24.016 --> 37:25.817
Can't stop 'em.

37:27.302 --> 37:29.170
Bad news?

37:29.604 --> 37:31.673
Bad, bad day.

37:31.773 --> 37:34.444
Mary, when we gonna get some coffee?

37:34.774 --> 37:36.645
Ask the president.

37:38.546 --> 37:40.381
How bad?

37:41.282 --> 37:43.151
Real bad.

37:43.251 --> 37:44.786
Lost...

37:45.220 --> 37:47.756
- Your guy?
- Yeah.

37:49.257 --> 37:50.789
No...

37:52.741 --> 37:54.802
...he wasn't just a guy.

37:56.064 --> 37:58.535
He was the only one who saw the real me.

37:59.435 --> 38:01.671
He was my best friend before he was...

38:02.171 --> 38:05.875
Look, life goes on, hon. You'll find another.

38:05.975 --> 38:07.828
He was killed today.

38:08.676 --> 38:11.513
- Fuck.
- Murdered.

38:12.313 --> 38:14.191
Double fuck.

38:14.934 --> 38:17.453
- And they're going to get away with it.
- What are you saying?

38:17.553 --> 38:19.355
They're too rich, they're too powerful.

38:19.455 --> 38:22.739
I don't know what happened.
I don't want to know. But...

38:22.839 --> 38:25.079
- ...you got to make them pay somehow.
- But I can't.

38:25.179 --> 38:29.266
Somehow. You can't let
the bad guys always win.

38:30.366 --> 38:32.802
And you must fulfill your destiny.

38:34.804 --> 38:37.177
Always ringing at the wrong time.

38:38.407 --> 38:41.878
And I hate that it's always
broadcasting your location.

38:42.378 --> 38:44.245
Stay brave.

39:39.467 --> 39:41.203
Good evening.

39:41.303 --> 39:43.629
Good evening again...

39:43.729 --> 39:45.874
...one and all.

39:45.974 --> 39:49.932
You know why we requested
your presence, don't you, Richard?

39:50.032 --> 39:53.682
- I can guess.
- Don't guess. Tell us.

39:53.982 --> 39:55.484
Please.

39:55.950 --> 39:59.889
To explain why the ancient craft
has yet to be disposed of.

39:59.989 --> 40:01.390
Destroyed.

40:01.490 --> 40:05.094
The harlot captured. And eliminated.

40:05.194 --> 40:08.197
You know that I will ultimately
follow your orders.

40:08.297 --> 40:09.966
Ultimately?

40:11.982 --> 40:15.603
I... please do not misinterpret.

40:15.703 --> 40:19.323
- Are we?
- I pray not...

40:19.423 --> 40:22.209
...but I would, once again...

40:22.309 --> 40:25.249
...wish to request more time...

40:25.349 --> 40:27.749
...to access its inner workings.

40:27.849 --> 40:30.937
We grow weary of explaining to you
that whatever it contains...

40:31.037 --> 40:35.157
...can not counter the negative
cultural effects of its existence.

40:35.257 --> 40:38.694
Even, even if it were not constructed...

40:38.794 --> 40:41.630
...by creatures, monsters,
from some other world...

40:41.730 --> 40:44.500
...but built instead by humans...

40:44.600 --> 40:49.837
...identical to us from some long past age?

40:50.038 --> 40:51.974
Even more so.

40:52.074 --> 40:55.711
Certainly, you have not forgotten
that such knowledge of their existence...

40:55.811 --> 40:58.651
...would undermine
our prime means of control.

41:01.749 --> 41:05.454
- Of course not.
- The time for closure has now arrived.

41:05.554 --> 41:08.778
- Has passed.
- And...

41:08.878 --> 41:13.428
...I will immediately fulfill your wishes.

41:13.528 --> 41:17.400
The relic ground into dust
and scattered to the wind.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.335
The harlot?

41:19.435 --> 41:21.871
Located and butchered, of course.

41:22.571 --> 41:24.707
See that you do.

41:24.807 --> 41:26.308
I will.

41:26.408 --> 41:28.242
Good evening, Richard.

41:35.216 --> 41:36.751
Fuck.

41:38.721 --> 41:41.357
<i>What's up? Oh, yes, sir, Mr. Kontral.</i>

41:41.457 --> 41:43.959
I'm accelerating the examination
of our project.

41:44.059 --> 41:47.529
- <i>Cool.</i>
- Be prepared to begin with...

41:48.864 --> 41:50.966
This the harlot you're looking for, shithead?

41:51.066 --> 41:53.335
So melodramatic.

41:53.435 --> 41:55.604
How on Earth did you manage to get in here?

41:55.704 --> 41:58.640
Amazing what some guys'll do
for major blow job.

41:58.740 --> 42:02.511
- From you? I don't think so.
- I care not.

42:02.611 --> 42:05.815
You do realize you're not getting
out of here alive, don't you, dear?

42:05.915 --> 42:08.517
- Kind of figured that.
- So why the visit?

42:08.617 --> 42:11.453
- To slit your fucking throat.
- Oh, such malice.

42:11.553 --> 42:15.057
- Yes, that's me.
- How blandly lower middle class.

42:15.157 --> 42:18.467
Just because we butchered
your pathetic little sweetheart?

42:21.312 --> 42:24.166
- Fuck.
- On your knees.

42:24.634 --> 42:27.068
Listen to her.

42:30.990 --> 42:34.410
It's the only way you're ever gonna
get a woman to do that, you creep.

42:34.510 --> 42:39.381
Why must you continuously insist on
referencing such an unpleasant subject?

42:39.481 --> 42:43.052
- Fuck you.
- I do like your attitude.

42:43.152 --> 42:48.007
So come on, tell me.
Just to satisfy my ever inquiring mind...

42:48.107 --> 42:50.650
...how did you manage to slip by security?

42:51.961 --> 42:55.197
No sweat. Your girlfriend
stepped out for a smoke.

42:55.297 --> 42:57.299
Nicole, I'm disappointed.

42:57.399 --> 43:00.569
Your bosses need
a higher level of employment.

43:00.669 --> 43:03.872
Oh, well, it's a national problem.

43:04.339 --> 43:08.978
I am sorry we didn't get to spend
more quality time together, Sharon.

43:09.578 --> 43:12.347
Oh, well. Dispose of her.

43:12.447 --> 43:15.377
That you'll find she's really very good at.

43:15.617 --> 43:17.553
<i>Holy shit.</i>

43:19.353 --> 43:21.588
That's awkward.

43:22.356 --> 43:25.494
You... heard our whole little confrontation?

43:26.396 --> 43:28.197
<i>I know nothing.</i>

43:28.697 --> 43:30.999
Help me. Don't let this...

43:32.267 --> 43:35.304
Now my hand is seriously pained.

43:36.537 --> 43:39.908
It's about time we put an end
to your sad little story.

43:40.008 --> 43:42.111
- <i>Mr. Kontral?</i>
- What?

43:42.211 --> 43:45.581
<i>When that woman comes on camera,
the readings here, they blast off the charts.</i>

43:45.681 --> 43:48.801
- What do you mean?
- <i>From the spaceship.</i>

43:48.901 --> 43:51.703
- Really?
- <i>Yep.</i>

43:52.186 --> 43:54.190
What, when it saw her?

43:54.990 --> 43:56.992
Point your camera at her.

44:03.446 --> 44:05.168
Change of plan.

44:05.800 --> 44:10.391
Bring her along with us.
Secure her in the usual manner.

44:16.711 --> 44:19.208
Welcome, Sharon.

44:22.183 --> 44:25.988
Now let's see if you really are
essential to this historic puzzle.

44:26.088 --> 44:27.886
Fuck you.

44:27.986 --> 44:29.876
Check the readouts.

44:30.726 --> 44:32.227
Shazam.

44:32.327 --> 44:34.191
All right, here, let me have that.

44:36.565 --> 44:39.280
Well, now that is very interesting.

44:39.380 --> 44:43.005
You really are linked
to our little project, aren't you?

44:43.105 --> 44:47.209
All I did was interpret some etchings.
Just doing my job, you creep.

44:47.309 --> 44:50.412
No, you're far more than that,
way beyond random coincidence.

44:50.512 --> 44:54.917
This ship lying dormant for thousands of
years and then reacting now only to you.

44:55.017 --> 44:56.825
Serendipity?

44:56.925 --> 44:58.687
Oh, I don't think so.

44:58.787 --> 45:01.132
Chess pieces are being moved.

45:01.232 --> 45:03.157
Go fuck yourself.

45:03.295 --> 45:04.596
Now, Sharon...

45:04.696 --> 45:08.155
...if you're going to be part of history,
you'll have to be a little more elegant.

45:10.831 --> 45:13.135
It just can't wait to meet you.

45:13.235 --> 45:14.570
Easy with the camera.

45:14.670 --> 45:17.107
Bill me. Come on, let's take a little walk.

45:19.307 --> 45:21.157
I'll stay here and man the shop.

45:27.381 --> 45:29.184
Stay close.

45:30.418 --> 45:34.319
And those idiots wanted me
to destroy this treasure.

45:35.656 --> 45:37.162
Bring her.

45:42.913 --> 45:45.351
Well, you were right about one thing.

45:45.601 --> 45:48.203
- It is beautiful.
- It's not yours.

45:48.303 --> 45:49.538
Oh, whose is it?

45:49.638 --> 45:51.473
- It belongs to...
- To the world?

45:51.573 --> 45:54.175
- To science?
- Yes.

45:55.376 --> 45:58.178
Well, that's not going to happen.
Give me your gun.

45:58.278 --> 46:01.717
So you and I are going to continue
our little walk alone.

46:01.817 --> 46:04.853
Just to see what happens. Move.

46:07.688 --> 46:11.530
Don't be frightened. I have a very strong
feeling this thing doesn't want to harm you.

46:11.630 --> 46:13.595
Yeah, well, hopefully
that doesn't include you.

46:13.695 --> 46:15.229
Wait.

46:17.331 --> 46:20.698
A valid concern. On your knees.

46:20.798 --> 46:22.061
- What?
- On your knees.

46:22.161 --> 46:25.573
- You're fucking kidding me.
- I never kid. Just do it.

46:25.993 --> 46:28.409
Put your hands on the surface. Touch it.

46:32.664 --> 46:35.133
It is so exited to see you.

46:36.083 --> 46:37.953
Now, what do you feel?

46:38.553 --> 46:40.789
I said, what do you feel?

46:43.491 --> 46:46.727
It's cold, powerful.

46:47.595 --> 46:51.032
Wonderful. Cold power.

46:51.492 --> 46:55.151
Wonderful. Thank you, Sharon.

46:55.251 --> 46:58.222
I don't think I could have
put it any better myself.

46:58.322 --> 47:00.946
See, that's what this has all been about.

47:01.046 --> 47:03.311
Cold power, Sharon.

47:03.686 --> 47:06.190
Cold power and when I have it
at my command...

47:06.290 --> 47:10.091
...when I control it, I mean fully
control it, and in my control alone...

47:10.191 --> 47:15.330
...then I'll take that power and the world
will have to listen to Richard Kontral!

47:18.976 --> 47:20.311
Asshole.

47:48.423 --> 47:49.778
Oh, shit.

48:04.338 --> 48:06.593
Time for a smoke.

48:06.693 --> 48:08.373
Nice tin man.

48:08.909 --> 48:10.911
Nice tin man.

48:14.081 --> 48:16.151
Have fun tonight, bitch.

48:47.715 --> 48:49.250
Hello?

48:53.203 --> 48:54.789
Hello?

48:55.256 --> 48:58.900
Anybody out there? How's it going?

49:02.997 --> 49:04.532
Hello?

50:37.391 --> 50:40.619
You don't want to miss
the whole adventure, do you?

51:12.526 --> 51:15.897
Your awakening has been
duly noted by our tall friend.

51:15.997 --> 51:17.732
Oh, God.

51:17.832 --> 51:21.502
- And he appears to be very interested...
- Shut the fuck up.

51:32.430 --> 51:34.365
Take your clothes off.

51:35.000 --> 51:38.903
- What, and get on my knees?
- Oh, please, you're not that irresistible.

51:41.589 --> 51:43.391
Take them off.

51:44.241 --> 51:47.696
- Do it, or it's going to.
- Okay, okay, okay.

52:15.006 --> 52:17.626
- What?
- Socks, don't forget your socks.

52:17.726 --> 52:19.594
Stop helping me.

52:57.930 --> 53:00.267
Queen of outer space.

53:01.869 --> 53:04.320
You have no idea of how close you are.

53:07.475 --> 53:11.379
Well, then, would you please enlighten me.

53:11.479 --> 53:13.682
Since when did we become friends?

53:14.182 --> 53:16.986
Slitting your throat
is still my number one priority.

53:17.686 --> 53:19.788
Well, that's a real shame.

53:19.888 --> 53:22.925
And here I thought
we were getting along so well.

53:43.243 --> 53:44.779
Forward.

53:49.950 --> 53:52.688
- Even Mr. Ray Charles, right?
- What?

53:54.088 --> 53:56.463
Nothing of interest.

54:15.325 --> 54:18.346
The moon? We're there?

54:18.946 --> 54:22.484
- Apparently so.
- So fast. How is that possible?

54:22.584 --> 54:25.293
Super science. Super power.

54:25.819 --> 54:29.057
- So, you haven't a clue.
- Not a one.

55:31.585 --> 55:35.393
You're the first woman on the moon,
I believe. Any appropriate words?

55:35.493 --> 55:37.323
Fuck off.

55:37.792 --> 55:39.561
And you're wrong.

55:39.661 --> 55:41.495
How so?

55:44.664 --> 55:46.533
I've met her twin sister.

55:48.317 --> 55:49.875
Who is she?

56:11.224 --> 56:15.769
Curiouser and curiouser grows our tale.

57:23.130 --> 57:26.434
- Well, that was entertaining.
- Since when did you become comedy relief?

57:26.534 --> 57:29.203
- Oh, please, by no means.
- Just shut the hell up.

57:29.303 --> 57:32.173
Don't say another word to me. Got it?

57:32.273 --> 57:34.107
Got it.

58:17.034 --> 58:18.984
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

58:20.754 --> 58:24.592
Sure, after flying to the moon
and getting attacked by a killer robot...

58:24.692 --> 58:27.995
...how difficult can it be
to put on an ancient space suit?

58:28.095 --> 58:29.929
Why not?

58:35.269 --> 58:36.904
Okay.

58:37.537 --> 58:39.440
Ready for whatever.

58:39.540 --> 58:43.080
I have to say I'm very curious
to see what awaits you.

58:45.446 --> 58:48.048
Stop, stop, stop!

58:48.412 --> 58:50.618
Thank you. Thank you.

58:52.387 --> 58:54.289
Thank you so much.

58:54.389 --> 58:56.898
Thank you. Thank you.

59:02.679 --> 59:05.592
But why, why did you do that?

59:07.200 --> 59:08.936
Not sure.

59:09.036 --> 59:11.132
Maybe I'm just a good person.

59:12.472 --> 59:14.341
Thank you.

59:14.775 --> 59:18.446
- I really thought I was...
- Or maybe I wanted to kill you myself.

59:22.716 --> 59:24.384
Whatever.

59:24.985 --> 59:26.971
Just be careful.

59:27.071 --> 59:29.541
We're in this together now, you know.

59:31.695 --> 59:33.992
Come back in one piece, okay?

59:47.007 --> 59:50.042
No, fuck you.

01:00:33.787 --> 01:00:35.589
Journey's end.

01:02:07.647 --> 01:02:12.119
Watching, learning while you were dreaming...

01:02:12.619 --> 01:02:15.455
...my sweet little scout.

01:02:37.563 --> 01:02:39.113
Easy, easy.

01:02:46.753 --> 01:02:50.823
Up, up, up, and away we go.

01:02:57.097 --> 01:03:01.349
Homeward bound, nice and steady,
nice and steady.

01:03:01.836 --> 01:03:04.269
Second star on the right...

01:03:04.805 --> 01:03:07.221
...and straight on to morning.

01:03:14.648 --> 01:03:16.450
Damn you.

01:03:44.794 --> 01:03:46.616
Now what?

01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:05.165
Asshole.

01:06:32.478 --> 01:06:34.313
I'll try.

01:06:34.414 --> 01:06:36.249
I'll try.

01:09:14.273 --> 01:09:16.076
Dear God...

01:09:16.734 --> 01:09:18.551
...what have I done?

01:13:55.388 --> 01:13:57.635
I'm going to follow it through, Daniel.

01:13:58.625 --> 01:14:00.427
Finish our job.

01:14:31.290 --> 01:14:32.825
Garen.

01:14:35.962 --> 01:14:37.764
Waiting for Mya.

01:14:46.739 --> 01:14:50.878
<i>Long ago, the Krell crystal
created a world for our people.</i>

01:14:50.978 --> 01:14:54.581
<i>The crystal's origin was unknown,
lost in time.</i>

01:14:54.681 --> 01:14:57.451
<i>When destruction
from the stars was foretold...</i>

01:14:57.551 --> 01:15:00.887
<i>...Lord God Garen bid me
to bring the Krell to this world...</i>

01:15:00.987 --> 01:15:03.957
<i>...so he could prepare
a new home for our people.</i>

01:15:04.057 --> 01:15:09.028
<i>But I failed, so I have selected you
to fulfill my destiny.</i>

01:15:18.804 --> 01:15:21.321
Will you one day be awakened...

01:15:21.421 --> 01:15:24.272
...and thanked for making this new world...

01:15:26.217 --> 01:15:28.441
...my Lord God Garen?

01:15:32.985 --> 01:15:35.065
On your knees, Sharon.

01:16:02.014 --> 01:16:03.415
Hey.

01:16:04.917 --> 01:16:06.352
Hey.

01:16:06.719 --> 01:16:08.154
Here.

01:16:09.491 --> 01:16:11.357
Right here.

01:16:11.457 --> 01:16:13.926
Come on. Come on.

01:16:20.299 --> 01:16:23.339
Hey, I'll get on my knees.

01:17:35.257 --> 01:17:37.099
Queen of outer space?

01:17:38.477 --> 01:17:40.312
No way.

01:18:02.268 --> 01:18:04.469
Into the river of time.

01:18:05.305 --> 01:18:11.521
