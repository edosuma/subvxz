01:03.007 --> 01:05.760
How you do it?
You just throw it like that?

01:06.207 --> 01:09.722
Looks like I won. Man, if you don"t get
your hands off my money... Please.

01:10.887 --> 01:13.640
- I ain"t never gonna go broke.
- Roll that shit again.

01:13.847 --> 01:17.237
Brother, put your money in.
Can"t win unless you play.

01:17.447 --> 01:19.597
You gotta throw it in there.
There we go.

01:19.807 --> 01:23.925
Am I right? Slipped right out
of my hands. Look at that.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.203
Yo, Bunz, we gotta go.

01:27.247 --> 01:29.203
Seriously, his sister"s
got some ill will.

01:29.407 --> 01:32.205
This is going to a good cause.
Sorry I gotta go like this.

01:32.407 --> 01:35.126
Next time, to keep your shit,
you gotta know when to quit.

01:35.287 --> 01:36.606
Let"s leave. Quickly.

01:36.767 --> 01:39.361
Hey, brothers, y"all stay broke.
I mean, stay black.

01:39.567 --> 01:42.286
Lucky you stopped me. I was about to
buy a condo in midtown.

01:42.447 --> 01:43.960
- Lucky I stopped you?
- Hell, yeah.

01:44.167 --> 01:48.877
I can tell Nikki, "We was late because
Bunz was on his knees playing dice."

01:49.047 --> 01:51.720
Playing? I was the MVP.
You didn"t hear the roar of the crowd?

01:53.087 --> 01:55.123
- Don"t want your cut?
- I ain"t saying that.

01:55.287 --> 01:58.882
Fuck you, motherfucker. Get out
of my shit, know what l"m saying?

01:59.047 --> 02:01.515
I don"t need your tired ass!
Go back to your skank ho!

02:01.727 --> 02:05.322
She called and left her fucking number
and I caught your ass in the act!

02:05.487 --> 02:07.523
Big nose, pop eyes, receding hairline.

02:07.687 --> 02:10.440
Truth is, you can"t win, motherfucker!

02:10.607 --> 02:14.725
Let me see you rise now, motherfucker!
No, I don"t think so!

02:14.887 --> 02:18.004
Man, you ain"t got to take that.
Jab back, baby. Jab back.

02:18.207 --> 02:19.879
Hold up one motherfucking minute!

02:20.047 --> 02:23.005
When I need Howard Cosell,
I will call Howard Cosell!

02:23.167 --> 02:25.522
Take your fake-dreaded ass,
pick up Mighty Mouse...

02:25.687 --> 02:28.963
...and skippity-doo
your rank ass home, motherfucker!

02:29.127 --> 02:31.766
Better run, man!
Got a greyhound on your back!

02:31.967 --> 02:34.959
See? That"s why I don"t
like relationships, man.

02:35.127 --> 02:37.118
That why I strictly deal
with booty calls.

02:37.287 --> 02:39.039
Three a.m., no questions asked.

02:39.207 --> 02:41.516
Speaking of that,
I don"t wanna do this blind date.

02:41.687 --> 02:45.077
You go do your thing. L"m gonna
go back and try to win me some money.

02:45.247 --> 02:49.160
Hey, you can do what you want, Bunz,
okay? But this girl is fine.

02:49.327 --> 02:51.636
Miss Butterworth fine.

02:51.807 --> 02:55.277
- It"s up to you.
- Miss Butterworth gives me gas.

02:55.487 --> 02:59.196
Rushon, define "fine."
What does the girl look like?

02:59.367 --> 03:02.086
I ain"t sitting at the table
with no wildebeest.

03:02.247 --> 03:05.319
I got a reputation.
You know what l"m saying?

03:05.487 --> 03:08.399
What about that fruit bat
you left the party with?

03:08.567 --> 03:10.444
I was gonna tell you about that.

03:10.607 --> 03:13.121
That girl put something
in my drink, man. L"m serious.

03:13.287 --> 03:15.005
Because I wouldn"t go out like that.

03:15.167 --> 03:17.920
- The girl had a beard.
- She did not have a beard.

03:18.087 --> 03:20.885
- She had a beard. She had hair...
- She did not have a beard.

03:21.047 --> 03:23.800
She had a goatee.
Real nice and thin...

03:25.287 --> 03:29.121
If your girl ain"t Chinese, then why the
hell she live way down in Chinatown?

03:29.287 --> 03:33.963
Good neighbourhood, nice apartment.
Her girlfriend lives across the hall.

03:34.127 --> 03:37.563
The girlfriend is Chinese.
You thought l"d be upset.

03:37.727 --> 03:40.241
I don"t mind having a little
Rice Krispies on my plate.

03:40.447 --> 03:43.166
That means she know how
to pan-fry this noodle.

03:43.327 --> 03:46.080
- She"s not Chinese.
- Then what"s going on? Watch yourself.

03:46.247 --> 03:49.842
Chinese or not, she could still
snuggle up on these egg rolls.

03:50.007 --> 03:52.043
You know what l"m saying?
They lower in fat.

03:52.367 --> 03:55.200
See, that"s the reason why
l"II never take your ass nowhere.

03:55.367 --> 03:58.006
You take me everywhere.
If I was a girl, we"d be dating.

03:59.847 --> 04:01.997
Rushon"s friend is cute, right?

04:02.287 --> 04:03.925
Oh, he"s cute enough.

04:04.127 --> 04:06.357
No, no, no. You said he was cute.

04:06.567 --> 04:09.035
L"m not asking you to have
the man"s baby.

04:09.207 --> 04:12.040
Just run a little interference for me.
Know what l"m saying?

04:12.767 --> 04:16.555
Okay.
But he does have class, though, right?

04:16.726 --> 04:19.524
You know I do not mess with anyone
that does not have class.

04:19.726 --> 04:23.925
Trust me. He is in a class
all by hisself.

04:25.967 --> 04:29.039
Yo, man, what kind of name
is Lystie anyway?

04:29.207 --> 04:30.640
It"s short for Lysterine.

04:30.807 --> 04:34.117
That"s motherfucking mouthwash.
What"s up with these wack-ass names?

04:34.287 --> 04:38.326
I went out with this girl named Genoria,
but she spelled it like "gonorrhoea."

04:38.487 --> 04:39.966
I can"t put that on a postcard.

04:40.127 --> 04:41.765
It"s Lysterine with a Y, not an I.

04:41.927 --> 04:44.680
Oh, that makes all the difference
in the world, Rushon.

04:44.847 --> 04:47.236
The point is
you"re doing this for me.

04:47.407 --> 04:49.602
L"ve been going out with Nikki
for seven weeks...

04:49.767 --> 04:51.758
Seven weeks?
And you ain"t hit that ass yet?

04:51.927 --> 04:53.201
Hey, man, I like her, okay?

04:53.367 --> 04:55.164
"Hey, man, I like her, okay?"

04:55.567 --> 04:58.445
Nikki, why are you taking so long?

04:58.607 --> 05:01.326
- I can"t go out like this.
- Here we go. Like what?

05:01.487 --> 05:03.443
My cleavage is hanging out.

05:03.607 --> 05:05.120
Cleavage?

05:05.567 --> 05:08.161
I just don"t wanna send out
the wrong signal.

05:08.327 --> 05:12.764
I think anyone that"s put up with you for
seven weeks deserves some nay-nay.

05:12.927 --> 05:15.157
- Oh, really?
- Nikki...

05:15.327 --> 05:17.283
...why are you making Rushon
wait so long?

05:17.447 --> 05:21.486
He seems like he"s a good man.
He"s got a career. He treats you nice.

05:21.647 --> 05:23.160
I know.

05:23.647 --> 05:25.763
I just wanna make sure
that he"s the right one.

05:25.927 --> 05:27.997
Just don"t leave me alone with him.

05:28.887 --> 05:32.084
Sounds like he"s not the only one
feeling the seven-week itch.

05:32.287 --> 05:34.357
It is not even like that.

05:34.567 --> 05:37.206
You better watch that smile, then.

05:37.367 --> 05:39.437
- Can we please go?
- All right.

05:39.767 --> 05:41.962
This is how I peep the situation,
like this.

05:42.247 --> 05:44.203
I think that college got you
too sensitive.

05:44.367 --> 05:47.086
- Sensitive?
- You ain"t got no player left in you.

05:47.247 --> 05:50.842
If I was you, I wouldn"t let the sun rise
without tagging that ass.

05:51.007 --> 05:54.886
If it was me, l"d have that ass bouncing
like a low rider in a Dr. Dre video.

05:55.047 --> 05:58.517
I say, " Miss Nikki, tonight is the night.
It"s a one-time offer."

05:58.687 --> 06:02.521
She wanna give it to you tomorrow,
you say, " No, tomorrow"s too late."

06:02.687 --> 06:06.316
- It"s not that simple.
- Not for somebody who"s slipping.

06:06.487 --> 06:09.206
- Put me in the players" section.
- L"m not slipping.

06:09.447 --> 06:11.119
You slipping like a motherfucker.

06:11.287 --> 06:15.246
Look, Nikki and I are gonna
do our thing tonight.

06:15.447 --> 06:17.324
She knows it, and I know it.

06:17.487 --> 06:19.239
I don"t know why I disrespected you.

06:19.407 --> 06:21.363
But you"re a gambling man, right?

06:21.527 --> 06:24.678
Why don"t you put your money
where your mack is.

06:24.847 --> 06:26.678
I won"t bet money
on something like that.

06:26.847 --> 06:29.839
We don"t have to bet money.
Let"s just make it a gentleman"s bet.

06:30.007 --> 06:31.679
We"re gentlemen, right?

06:32.607 --> 06:34.723
- Not gonna let this go?
- Come on, big daddy...

06:34.887 --> 06:38.004
...big player, big pimp, big baller.

06:39.767 --> 06:42.998
There you go, that"s my boy.
You go the fuck on.

06:43.167 --> 06:46.682
He"s celebrating his bar mitzvah.
He just got circumcised.

06:46.847 --> 06:48.121
Go on with your food.

06:49.527 --> 06:54.237
Oh, Rushon. It"s so good
to see you this evening.

06:54.407 --> 06:56.284
And who is your friend?

06:56.447 --> 07:00.963
Hello. My name is Chan,
and l"m here to serve you tonight.

07:01.127 --> 07:03.402
Hey, brother. Rushon?

07:03.567 --> 07:05.523
Chan, we"re waiting on
our dinner guests.

07:07.087 --> 07:12.844
I think your hair is three things:
Fa-bu-Ious.

07:15.127 --> 07:19.166
Well, I got three things for you:
Back up, Yoko Ono.

07:19.327 --> 07:21.079
Oh, nigga, please.

07:23.927 --> 07:25.360
They"re here.

07:25.567 --> 07:30.004
Look, these girls got a lot of class.
So act like you got a little bit of sense.

07:30.327 --> 07:33.524
Like you got a mama. Like you
wasn"t mixed up in some test tube.

07:33.687 --> 07:36.076
We should move to a table
with better light.

07:36.247 --> 07:40.160
- What"s wrong with the light here?
- I can"t get with ladies in muted light.

07:40.327 --> 07:43.717
I need a good look.
Anybody can look good in dim light.

07:44.687 --> 07:47.520
How many times you go to a club,
and under the disco lights...

07:47.687 --> 07:50.485
...the girl look good?
You having a good time.

07:50.647 --> 07:53.684
But the next day you go to pick her up.
You"re all happy and shit.

07:53.847 --> 07:55.917
But it"s high noon.
She comes out the house...

07:56.087 --> 07:59.477
...and a fucking sea donkey
climbs into your car.

07:59.647 --> 08:03.242
I believe in a brother"s right to know
what the hell he"s feeding...

08:03.407 --> 08:05.125
Man, just get up.

08:08.087 --> 08:10.965
Lysterine, this is
Rushon"s friend, Bunz.

08:11.767 --> 08:14.839
Hey, now, I was...

08:15.007 --> 08:16.565
Excuse me.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.124
What do you think you are doing?

08:19.447 --> 08:23.406
Did you see that tarantula-hair fool?
Motherfucker look like Predator.

08:23.687 --> 08:28.044
It"s just dinner. Some egg rolls, mu shu,
and we out. Girl, why are you tripping?

08:28.327 --> 08:30.363
She don"t look like
she want my shit, man.

08:30.527 --> 08:32.961
No, she"s on you. She"s just nervous.

08:33.126 --> 08:35.687
- It"s a blind date. All right?
- All right. Right.

08:36.287 --> 08:38.039
Everybody"s got a weakness.

08:38.207 --> 08:40.596
Who knows? You and Bunz
just might hit it off.

08:40.807 --> 08:42.479
Bunz?

08:42.727 --> 08:45.446
You blind-date me with
a little "hood-rat named Bunz?

08:45.607 --> 08:47.120
Girl, have you lost your mind?

08:47.287 --> 08:49.881
No. I can"t get
with a brother named Bunz.

08:50.367 --> 08:52.881
No, but it"s Bunz with a Z, not an S.

08:55.367 --> 08:58.564
You never can be too ready.

08:59.727 --> 09:01.957
Just do this for me, please.

09:03.527 --> 09:05.995
- You owe me.
- Big-time. Now, let"s roll.

09:10.447 --> 09:13.359
Ladies, you look good.

09:15.127 --> 09:18.039
So, what"s up?

09:18.207 --> 09:21.517
- Nothing.
- Are we ready to order?

09:21.687 --> 09:26.124
- I am. I want the shrimp fried rice.
- Make that two, please.

09:26.327 --> 09:30.161
Perfect, and I will have the prawns
in garlic sauce.

09:30.327 --> 09:32.238
And you, Miss Thang?

09:32.407 --> 09:34.841
- Excuse me?
- You got her with the "Miss Thang."

09:36.567 --> 09:38.842
You eating or just looking?

09:39.167 --> 09:42.876
Okay, boyfriend. I want a lobster tail
in butter-wine sauce.

09:43.047 --> 09:44.765
And we girls want a bottle of Moët.

09:44.967 --> 09:49.483
Damn, girl, why you gotta order
the most expensive shit on the menu?

09:49.647 --> 09:52.923
- Rushon, you need to check your boy.
- Check my ass.

09:53.087 --> 09:55.078
That"s what l"m talking about,
is the check.

09:55.247 --> 09:58.956
Now, the lobster don"t even have
a price. It just says "seasonal."

09:59.127 --> 10:02.244
So you know what that means,
a brother gotta pay $28.

10:02.407 --> 10:07.197
And if I get you lobster and some Moët,
you know what"s happening after that.

10:07.367 --> 10:09.244
No, what does happen?

10:09.407 --> 10:12.638
L"m going deep-sea diving.

10:13.327 --> 10:16.080
Bunz, this is a platinum card.

10:16.247 --> 10:19.364
I could buy and sell
your ashy black, blue-collared ass.

10:19.567 --> 10:22.240
- Is that right?
- Yes, it is.

10:22.407 --> 10:24.477
Well, lookie here.

10:26.127 --> 10:28.880
- What is that?
- It"s a gold gas card.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.840
That means I can buy
all the gas I want...

10:32.047 --> 10:34.641
...in all 50 states
and 11 foreign countries.

10:34.807 --> 10:36.445
And I got platinum privileges too.

10:36.607 --> 10:39.758
Because, you know, if you buy enough
gas, they give you coffee mugs.

10:40.527 --> 10:42.563
A gas card?
You don"t even got a car.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.564
Why you putting me on front street?

10:44.727 --> 10:48.686
L"II have you to know that I laid away
a "68 Chevy Super Sport...

10:48.847 --> 10:54.877
...with a 427-cubic inch twin cam
with a Hurst gearshift.

10:55.087 --> 10:58.966
Sounds like a man who has some
serious doubts about his manhood.

10:59.127 --> 11:03.837
Those cars are nothing but extensions
of your penis or lack thereof.

11:04.687 --> 11:08.965
Yeah. You"re right,
because my dick is only two inches...

11:09.127 --> 11:10.879
...from the ground.

11:11.367 --> 11:12.720
Isn"t he grand?

11:14.887 --> 11:17.117
Can"t get a brother"s order straight.

11:17.287 --> 11:21.326
Look, I ordered shrimp fried rice.
Can I get some shrimp?

11:21.487 --> 11:25.446
Oh, there is one shrimp there
and another shrimp here.

11:25.607 --> 11:30.158
What"s with the green leafy stuff? You
trying to fool a brother with shrubbery.

11:30.327 --> 11:35.799
Child, that"s garnishment.
Make your food look good.

11:36.007 --> 11:39.841
What will make my food look good
is five extra shrimp.

11:41.527 --> 11:44.166
I thought there was no smoking
in this restaurant.

11:47.127 --> 11:50.437
- L"II take care of this.
- Bunz, sit down.

11:50.607 --> 11:53.917
That"s the notorious Ug Lee,
the godfather of the Leuang Triad.

11:54.087 --> 11:55.520
He runs Chinatown.

11:55.727 --> 11:58.924
Yeah, I know, I got all his albums.
L"II tell him you said what"s up.

12:35.567 --> 12:37.159
I know you impressed.

12:37.327 --> 12:39.966
You probably thought
I was just a common "hood-rat, huh?

12:44.567 --> 12:46.125
I didn"t know you spoke Chinese.

12:46.327 --> 12:48.363
Wasn"t like I could speak it
to your ass.

12:48.727 --> 12:51.400
- Where"d you learn?
- Watching kung fu movies.

12:51.567 --> 12:53.956
Me and my father, we always watched
kung fu movies.

12:54.207 --> 12:57.882
- They got subtitles.
- Our TV didn"t have a vertical hold.

12:58.047 --> 13:01.039
What l"d do is, l"d get the kung fu
videos and listen to them.

13:01.207 --> 13:03.801
Bit by bit, I started understanding
them motherfuckers.

13:03.967 --> 13:05.878
One time I went to
the Chinese laundry...

13:06.047 --> 13:08.766
...and all the shit that sounded like,
"Ping, ting, pang"...

13:08.927 --> 13:10.326
...started making sense.

13:10.487 --> 13:12.239
So why didn"t y"all just buy a new TV?

13:13.047 --> 13:14.844
Everybody ain"t got
no platinum card.

13:15.007 --> 13:18.044
You know, there is some poor folk
out in the world.

13:18.487 --> 13:20.398
How"s your shrimp, baby?

13:20.567 --> 13:22.319
He ain"t got no shrimp over there.

13:22.487 --> 13:24.523
Oh, here"s one.

13:25.167 --> 13:26.998
You can have it, baby.

13:29.207 --> 13:32.404
Oh, my goodness, you whipped.
That boy is whipped.

13:33.207 --> 13:35.926
You know what?
You need to pay attention and learn.

13:36.487 --> 13:38.921
All he did was gave you
a old crusty-ass shrimp.

13:39.127 --> 13:41.641
There"s that"hood-rat
emerging again.

13:58.847 --> 14:02.840
No fighting in restaurant.
Cost you extra to fight in restaurant.

14:04.527 --> 14:06.404
Fuck me?

14:08.527 --> 14:10.279
- My mother?
- My mother?

14:11.287 --> 14:13.801
Suck these fortune-cookie nuts
and read your future...

14:14.007 --> 14:16.965
You are a horse-mouth bitch
motherfucker.

14:17.167 --> 14:19.727
I will stick my elbow
sideways up your ass.

15:08.367 --> 15:11.677
Hold this for me, baby. Thank you.

15:18.767 --> 15:20.405
Bring it. Send it.

15:22.447 --> 15:25.644
All that, now. That ain"t nothing
but some old beginner"s luck.

15:25.847 --> 15:28.680
- Here"s a little cleavage for mommy.
- Thank you.

15:28.847 --> 15:30.758
Cleavage? She needs a whole...

15:35.007 --> 15:37.567
- Well, anyway...
- See, that"s why you"re losing.

15:37.727 --> 15:39.558
Yeah, l"m losing, but I ain"t lost.

15:56.807 --> 16:00.561
So nice. So sweet. Give it up, nigga.

16:00.767 --> 16:05.636
L"m in the money. What? We in
the money. Got a little cleavage here.

16:11.487 --> 16:13.478
Beginner"s luck, huh?

16:14.527 --> 16:15.801
Shit happens.

16:50.087 --> 16:51.281
You tripping.

16:51.487 --> 16:52.920
L"m tripping?

17:32.207 --> 17:32.647
- It"s a little messy in here.
- Girl, don"t even worry about it.

17:32.647 --> 17:35.844
- It"s a little messy in here.
- Girl, don"t even worry about it.

17:36.007 --> 17:41.127
- It"s about to get real messy. Ready?
- L"m gonna do my thing. Here we go.

17:46.447 --> 17:49.484
Excuse me, but where do you two
think you"re going?

17:49.687 --> 17:52.838
Thought l"d put on some mood music
so we could dance a little bit.

17:53.047 --> 17:55.322
I think you have done enough
dancing for tonight.

17:55.527 --> 17:58.439
Come on, you got the ambience here.
You know how we do it, girl.

17:58.647 --> 18:02.435
Look, the only reason why we
came up here is to play some cards.

18:02.607 --> 18:04.643
After that, you two are going home.

18:07.487 --> 18:10.604
Dog, if you don"t... What is it?

18:10.807 --> 18:12.684
L"m going to kick your ass.

18:12.847 --> 18:17.238
Leave Killa alone. He does live here,
and you are just visiting, Bunz.

18:17.407 --> 18:20.797
Well, if we was really in China,
l"d have his ass honey-roasted.

18:21.207 --> 18:23.038
Play, Nikki.

18:25.887 --> 18:28.321
- Somebody"s cheating.
- Something"s going on.

18:28.767 --> 18:31.440
- I wish something was going on.
- Y"all are just mad...

18:31.607 --> 18:34.917
...because you losing.
I heard that, Rushon.

18:35.087 --> 18:38.079
- Caught you slipping again.
- Oh, that"s funny to y"all?

18:38.247 --> 18:41.796
A guy with a girl for seven weeks,
don"t get no intimacy, and that"s funny?

18:42.127 --> 18:46.484
Maybe the girl wants a relationship
and isn"t interested in casual sex.

18:46.687 --> 18:48.564
Maybe the girl wants
a deeper commitment.

18:48.727 --> 18:50.399
Maybe the girl wants a soul mate.

18:50.567 --> 18:52.603
Maybe the girl got
some soul-searching to do.

18:52.767 --> 18:54.803
Maybe got a brother uptown
with a 9-inch ding-dong...

18:54.967 --> 18:56.639
...knocking the bottom out your ass.

18:57.327 --> 19:00.000
- Shut up!
- I think it"s a legitimate question.

19:00.167 --> 19:03.523
If I was going out with a girl for seven
weeks, know what she"d be doing?

19:03.687 --> 19:06.599
She"d be playing the meat flute.
Riding the bologna pony.

19:06.767 --> 19:09.918
Eating tube steak, but you gotta work
a little for the gravy.

19:10.087 --> 19:13.363
Can I get some?
Excuse me.

19:13.967 --> 19:15.923
Thanks so much
for sharing that with us.

19:16.127 --> 19:19.881
L"ve been trying to share this big
paloosa with you all night, but you...

19:20.167 --> 19:23.045
Oh, boy, am I getting tired.
Ain"t you tired, Bunz?

19:23.247 --> 19:25.556
You know what,
l"m getting tired myself.

19:25.727 --> 19:28.321
- It is getting a little late, though.
- Lystie.

19:28.487 --> 19:30.876
Nikki. It is getting late.

19:31.047 --> 19:33.356
Look, since y"all tired,
and we definitely tired...

19:33.527 --> 19:35.995
...y"all go ahead.
We can kick it here.

19:36.167 --> 19:39.796
No, let"s still play cards.
Ain"t nobody going nowhere.

19:40.367 --> 19:41.720
- So, Lystie.
- What?

19:41.887 --> 19:43.878
Can I ask you a hypothetical question?

19:44.047 --> 19:47.323
Have you ever made a brother wait
seven weeks to get up on that thing?

19:47.527 --> 19:50.963
Why are you asking her? She ain"t
never made a man wait 30 minutes.

19:51.647 --> 19:53.524
Do I smell a whore?

19:53.727 --> 19:57.083
No, see, I have full confidence
in my sexuality.

19:57.247 --> 20:00.398
And I don"t toil over it,
unlike some prudes that I know.

20:00.607 --> 20:02.325
- Prude?
- Prude.

20:02.487 --> 20:06.196
Oh, see, I am nobody"s prude.
I just don"t wanna rush into having sex.

20:06.367 --> 20:09.279
And, see, that may be hard
for you to understand.

20:09.447 --> 20:12.405
Oh, really? Well, you might
be able to understand that...

20:12.567 --> 20:15.206
...if you cleared away those cobwebs
from your coochie.

20:15.927 --> 20:18.361
Coochie cobwebs?

20:18.527 --> 20:22.406
- Why don"t we just deal.
- Don"t stop now. I wanna see them box.

20:22.887 --> 20:26.243
Let"s get ready to rumble!

20:29.527 --> 20:32.997
What"s up?
Y"all ready for another one?

20:33.807 --> 20:35.923
L"d rather be shopping.

20:36.967 --> 20:39.845
Well, where is the love in this room?

20:40.007 --> 20:43.079
I got plenty of love,
I just can"t seem to get to it.

20:44.647 --> 20:46.239
Do you ever stop?

20:46.767 --> 20:49.520
No. I don"t ever stop.

20:49.967 --> 20:52.527
- Oh, really?
- Really.

21:48.327 --> 21:50.045
So are we gonna play cards or what?

22:04.447 --> 22:06.085
Oh, girl...

22:06.567 --> 22:11.083
...your feet are kind of strong,
but the softest feet in the world.

22:13.127 --> 22:14.799
Damn, man!

22:15.007 --> 22:18.317
Get those big, jungle-rot,
alligator feet off mine!

22:18.487 --> 22:21.126
You could snatch a salmon
with them eagles" claws!

22:21.687 --> 22:23.359
Big old cheese knots...

22:24.287 --> 22:26.118
Damn, something winked at me.

22:26.287 --> 22:28.198
Feet look like they played
soccer with wolves.

22:28.367 --> 22:31.325
Get your feet off me, man.
Look like monkey hands.

22:38.127 --> 22:39.765
Well...

22:55.087 --> 22:58.284
Suck it. Oh, yes...

23:04.647 --> 23:06.842
Oh, you gonna play
with a brother"s ass.

23:09.287 --> 23:13.997
You the MVP. A little lower.
Hit me on the taint.

23:14.167 --> 23:16.556
It "t"ain"t" the ass
and it "t"ain"t" the lip.

23:16.727 --> 23:20.481
Man, you talk about toe jam.

23:20.647 --> 23:22.319
Let me get my head together.

23:25.887 --> 23:28.196
L"m about to cramp up.

23:31.447 --> 23:34.598
I got a little cramp in my leg.
You got any napkins?

23:34.927 --> 23:38.806
You know, I think I left
my gas on in my stove.

23:38.967 --> 23:42.562
- Bunz, you know how to work a pilot?
- Yeah.

23:42.727 --> 23:45.161
Lystie, your stove"s
not even hooked up yet.

23:45.927 --> 23:48.202
You know what,
and speaking of remodelling...

23:48.367 --> 23:51.404
...l"ve got some paint samples
that I need to mix.

23:51.567 --> 23:53.239
Do you think you can assist me?

23:53.487 --> 23:56.365
I sure the fuck could, girl.
That"s my shit. Let"s go.

23:56.567 --> 24:00.003
Hold up. Excuse me.
Where do you guys think you"re going?

24:00.167 --> 24:03.398
- Nikki, we are gonna head on out.
- You ain"t even played the hand yet.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.080
- We just did.
- We just did.

24:05.247 --> 24:07.124
- Ciao.
- Lystie, wait a minute...

24:07.287 --> 24:09.642
- Woman, mind your business.
- No, wait...

24:14.767 --> 24:16.758
Give me that.

24:19.967 --> 24:21.241
Oh, yes.

24:21.407 --> 24:24.160
Oh, baby. All you got to do
is tell me how you like it.

24:24.767 --> 24:26.758
Oh, no, baby, you might think
l"m freaky.

24:27.207 --> 24:28.879
I don"t think you"re freaky.

24:29.447 --> 24:32.007
It really turns me on
when a man can do impressions.

24:32.167 --> 24:33.839
- Imitations.
- Imitations?

24:34.007 --> 24:36.680
Imitations, yeah.
Like, powerful men.

24:36.847 --> 24:39.486
Men of authority.
Men like Jesse Jackson.

24:40.007 --> 24:41.725
- Jesse Jackson?
- Yes.

24:42.487 --> 24:44.603
- Do Jesse.
- Hands that used to pick cotton...

24:44.767 --> 24:46.200
...can now pick the president?

24:46.367 --> 24:50.076
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, shit.

24:50.287 --> 24:53.643
The rhinoceros, though not as prolific
as others in the animal kingdom...

24:53.807 --> 24:55.843
...is nonetheless as enthusiastic.

24:56.007 --> 24:59.397
Watch as the 4000-pound beast
rises to the occasion.

24:59.567 --> 25:03.355
Wax that 4000-pound ass.

25:04.847 --> 25:07.998
Killa, stop that. No!

25:08.167 --> 25:10.123
Oh, it"s all right.

25:10.367 --> 25:11.766
He"s only human, right?

25:11.927 --> 25:14.805
How come you didn"t pet Killa
when Bunz was here?

25:14.967 --> 25:17.401
I think he"s a bad influence on you.
I do.

25:17.607 --> 25:20.360
Just let me say that
the ass is round.

25:20.967 --> 25:23.800
And you know that l"m down,
bipartisan.

25:24.447 --> 25:27.166
And we can work it to the ground.

25:27.567 --> 25:33.483
When I hit the skins, we can both join
together and say, "I am somebody."

25:33.647 --> 25:35.763
- I am. Somebody.
- I am. Somebody.

25:35.927 --> 25:37.599
- Say it loud. I am...
- I am...

25:37.767 --> 25:40.201
...somebody. Hallelujah.
...somebody. Somebody!

25:40.367 --> 25:42.164
- Smack my ass!
- Hallelujah!

25:42.527 --> 25:46.361
Do you know how sweet you are?
How nice you are?

25:46.527 --> 25:50.236
Then your boys come around,
it"s like,"What"s up, nigga?"

25:50.567 --> 25:52.319
Now, who you checking for? Me...

25:52.487 --> 25:56.116
...or Bunz?
- You.

25:56.327 --> 25:58.921
- L"m the heavyweight boxing champ.
- Yes, Michael.

25:59.087 --> 26:01.396
- I don"t care what people think.
- Yes, Michael.

26:01.567 --> 26:05.765
- It"s ludicrous how soft your skin is.
- It"s soft for you, baby.

26:05.927 --> 26:08.157
Reminds me of the leather
on my first gloves.

26:08.327 --> 26:09.601
Work it.

26:09.767 --> 26:11.837
- It makes me wanna work out.
- Work it, Mike.

26:12.007 --> 26:13.201
Just work it, Mike!

26:13.367 --> 26:15.722
- Yes, work it!
- Oh, you"re so vicious!

26:20.007 --> 26:23.124
Work it! Work it! Work it!

26:29.367 --> 26:31.927
- Wait.
- What? What? What?

26:32.087 --> 26:35.523
Rushon, do you have a condom?
I want this, I just don"t wanna die for it.

26:35.687 --> 26:37.006
- Condom?
- Yes.

26:37.167 --> 26:39.965
Yeah, I got a condom right in the coat.
You want a condom?

26:43.487 --> 26:46.047
I got a condom right here.
Right here, just like I said.

26:47.807 --> 26:52.676
Here you go. Safe sex.
Here we go, girl. L"II do my thing.

26:54.127 --> 26:55.924
Wait. Stop. Stay.

26:59.007 --> 27:00.838
Come here, baby.

27:07.767 --> 27:12.602
I would like to take my time
while l"m knocking the boots.

27:13.007 --> 27:14.406
Go, Bill.

27:16.887 --> 27:22.564
First, I start with the breasts because
nipples are so chocolatey and smooth.

27:24.607 --> 27:27.565
And then I work my way on down
to the love triangle.

27:27.727 --> 27:31.402
You like it. L"m kissing it
and licking it...

27:31.567 --> 27:33.239
...and thinking about sticking it.

27:33.407 --> 27:36.046
When I get there,
it"II be smooth and creamy...

27:36.207 --> 27:39.279
...just like the Jell-O pudding.

27:42.247 --> 27:44.556
Give me this goddamn condom,
you little...

27:44.727 --> 27:46.160
Rushon!

27:49.727 --> 27:51.240
There you go.

27:53.447 --> 27:55.358
A dog"s mouth is cleaner
than a human"s.

27:55.567 --> 27:57.683
- Rushon.
- You thought l"d use this on you...

27:57.847 --> 27:59.803
...after it"d been in the dog"s mouth?

27:59.967 --> 28:02.925
L"II go ahead and get me another one.

28:03.127 --> 28:04.446
Don"t be kicking my dog.

28:05.167 --> 28:07.727
Oh, you go, Bill.

28:07.887 --> 28:10.845
Have your little somethin"-somethin"
and a smile.

28:13.807 --> 28:17.402
Feel it, yes. Feel it. Feel it. Oh, yes.

28:17.767 --> 28:20.406
Hey, Bunz, you got any condoms?

28:20.567 --> 28:23.035
Stardate 2102:

28:23.207 --> 28:28.327
L"m without contraceptives,
so please leave me the fuck alone.

28:28.487 --> 28:30.603
Damn.

28:32.167 --> 28:34.476
So she was really doing it with Bunz?

28:34.647 --> 28:37.081
Sounded more like Bill Cosby
up in there.

28:37.247 --> 28:40.045
Lysterine always has been
a little kinky.

28:40.207 --> 28:41.799
- L"II call her.
- No.

28:41.967 --> 28:45.516
Come on, let the boy do what he do.

28:45.687 --> 28:47.279
And l"m gonna do what I do.

28:47.487 --> 28:49.682
Shit, it"s throwing me off. Hold on.

28:50.487 --> 28:54.002
- Let me listen.
- Longevity has its place.

28:54.527 --> 28:58.645
I may not get to the mountaintop
with you, but I have a dream.

28:58.807 --> 29:00.525
I have a dream too.

29:00.687 --> 29:03.804
I have a dream that one day,
every valley shall be explored.

29:03.967 --> 29:05.241
Explored.

29:05.407 --> 29:07.967
Every hill and every mountain
shall be fondled.

29:08.567 --> 29:10.637
I have a dream
that all the rough places...

29:10.847 --> 29:13.919
...will be laid smooth and all
the crooked places laid straight.

29:14.087 --> 29:15.156
Lay it straight!

29:15.327 --> 29:18.922
And I can look down upon
the voluptuous woman and say:

29:19.087 --> 29:22.602
- What you gonna say?
- " L"II wax that ass! L"II wax that ass.

29:22.767 --> 29:25.964
- Lord have mercy, l"II wax that ass!"
- Say it, brother!

29:26.127 --> 29:28.402
L"II go bananas
up in that rump shaker.

29:28.807 --> 29:31.002
Lystie, what are you
over there doing?

29:33.207 --> 29:36.085
- Nikki. Nothing.
- Nothing, my ass...

29:36.247 --> 29:39.796
I know you are not having unprotected
sex with Martin Luther King.

29:40.007 --> 29:42.919
Unsafe sex can be deadly.
You know that.

29:43.087 --> 29:47.399
Nik, Dr. King"s
about to rock my world.

29:48.247 --> 29:50.602
Girl, have you lost your mind?

29:50.767 --> 29:54.476
You don"t know Bunz.
You don"t know where he came from.

29:54.647 --> 29:56.603
- You better go get you a condom.
- Nikki.

29:57.247 --> 30:02.958
You take a hard look at Bunz
and tell me you don"t need a condom.

30:03.127 --> 30:05.243
I ain"t got nothing to do with this.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.162
What"s the problem?
We going to do this, or what?

30:15.167 --> 30:16.441
Bunz, l"m sorry.

30:16.607 --> 30:19.326
Don"t even worry about it.
Let"s just go get the condoms.

30:20.287 --> 30:23.802
- No, it is not what you think.
- Yes, it is.

30:23.967 --> 30:26.435
Nikki"s about to get her groove on.

30:26.607 --> 30:29.360
No, no, no. See, I told him
he can go to the store...

30:29.527 --> 30:31.358
...pick up some condoms,
and that"s it.

30:31.687 --> 30:33.279
Let"s just do what we gotta do.

30:33.447 --> 30:34.960
I was doing what I had to do.

30:35.127 --> 30:38.244
I don"t know about you, but I was
doing everything I had to do...

30:38.407 --> 30:40.398
...to get what I needed to do done.

30:40.607 --> 30:44.885
You"re gonna give the brother the keys
to the car and not let him drive it?

30:45.047 --> 30:49.086
Why are you asking all these questions,
Miss All-Up-in-My-Business?

30:49.247 --> 30:50.999
What are you gonna be doing?

30:51.167 --> 30:53.158
Would you really like to know?

30:53.327 --> 30:55.443
- Oh, God. I don"t even wanna know.
- No.

30:55.607 --> 30:58.804
Since you asked, I feel I should be
at liberty to share it with you.

30:58.967 --> 31:02.118
First, l"ve got some toys,
and then l"ve got some ice.

31:02.287 --> 31:06.041
- Some ice?
- Oh, yeah. Girl, I love ice.

31:06.207 --> 31:09.244
L"m gonna start at his toes
and just get him to...

31:16.927 --> 31:20.078
- No, no, we closed.
- Yo, yo, we just want some condoms.

31:20.247 --> 31:22.477
No condoms for Yoyo.
Yoyo, come here!

31:32.327 --> 31:35.922
He"s saying "yo" like "yo, man."
He"s not calling my name.

31:36.207 --> 31:39.836
No "Yoyo." "Yo, yo." I understand.

31:40.047 --> 31:43.039
Yo, later on, I get to dip
that soy sauce, is that cool?

31:48.047 --> 31:51.926
Come on, man. We got the girls
waiting for us back at the crib, man.

31:52.687 --> 31:55.963
Girl, girl. I have just what you need.

31:56.127 --> 32:00.200
Very special. Very rare.

32:01.207 --> 32:02.765
Tiger penis.

32:02.927 --> 32:05.805
Make you strong
in all the right places.

32:06.407 --> 32:10.002
Look, l"m already the king
of the jungle, know what l"m saying?

32:10.167 --> 32:12.806
Man, just give us
the best condoms you got.

32:13.407 --> 32:15.443
Fine, fine.

32:16.407 --> 32:17.726
Lambskin.

32:17.887 --> 32:20.640
Very sensitive. Twelve-pack.

32:20.807 --> 32:25.005
Leaves some feeling
for your jimmy. Only $38.

32:25.207 --> 32:26.845
- Thirty-eight dollars?
- Look, man.

32:27.007 --> 32:29.805
I ain"t got 12 dicks to put that on.
I just need one or two.

32:29.967 --> 32:33.403
No can break box.
Only have 12-pack.

32:33.567 --> 32:36.445
Twelve condom not much
for king of the jungle.

32:37.327 --> 32:39.318
You trying to break my pockets, G.

32:39.887 --> 32:43.163
Gi, my cousin. I am Chiu.

32:43.327 --> 32:44.919
Now, you want skins or what?

32:45.887 --> 32:49.197
Yo, man, if you get those,
you better hit some Nikki skins.

32:49.367 --> 32:52.564
- What other choice have we got?
- You know, me, I just put the tip in.

32:52.727 --> 32:55.287
You might not be putting nothing in.

32:58.287 --> 33:01.677
Hey, tonight, before the sun rises.

33:01.847 --> 33:05.044
Hey, look, all I need is one.
L"II just wash it out and use it again.

33:05.207 --> 33:07.084
Recycle, baby.

33:13.687 --> 33:15.803
L"m back.

33:15.967 --> 33:17.525
Nikki.

33:20.687 --> 33:22.439
Champagne.

33:27.247 --> 33:30.080
"Open me." I can do that.

33:32.607 --> 33:35.075
Or at least I think I can. Get your...

33:39.327 --> 33:40.965
Hi.

33:43.887 --> 33:45.798
Just got a little excited.

33:46.327 --> 33:49.558
- Maybe I should put this thing on ice.
- Put it on ice.

33:50.047 --> 33:51.958
I could do that too.

33:59.767 --> 34:01.200
What"s wrong?

34:01.367 --> 34:03.483
Damn cardboard is sticking me.

34:04.527 --> 34:07.121
- Condoms.
- Condoms.

34:07.287 --> 34:09.118
Safe way to go.

34:16.527 --> 34:19.563
- What kind of condoms are these?
- "Condom" condoms, babe.

34:20.246 --> 34:24.286
These are lambskin. Don"t you listen
to the surgeon general?

34:24.447 --> 34:27.438
Lambskin condoms don"t
protect you against the HIV virus.

34:27.607 --> 34:30.917
Baby, l"m government-tested,
grade A, clear as a bell.

34:31.127 --> 34:33.277
- Don"t even go there.
- Yeah, but...

34:33.447 --> 34:37.281
Rushon, just go to the store
and get some latex.

34:37.887 --> 34:39.684
Okay? Please.

34:40.927 --> 34:42.485
Latex.

34:42.647 --> 34:44.558
Latex.

34:46.766 --> 34:48.678
Goddamn sheep.

34:48.847 --> 34:51.407
Wimpy little woolly lamb-chop ass.

34:52.087 --> 34:53.804
Where you going?

34:53.967 --> 34:57.482
I was gonna put some clothes on
and take Killa for a walk.

34:58.167 --> 35:00.601
- L"II take Killa for a walk. Okay?
- Okay.

35:00.767 --> 35:02.598
We supposed to be
bonding anyway, right?

35:02.767 --> 35:04.120
Man"s best friend, right?

35:04.287 --> 35:08.041
You just stay put with your fine self.
You got that?

35:08.207 --> 35:09.686
- L"II be back.
- Okay.

35:16.527 --> 35:17.801
Bunz...

35:17.967 --> 35:19.844
...the condoms we got
are no good, man.

35:20.007 --> 35:22.601
L"m going back to Mr. Chiu"s.
They"re lambskin.

35:25.087 --> 35:26.486
What am I doing?

35:26.647 --> 35:28.319
Hey, have a good time, man.

35:28.847 --> 35:30.405
- We will!
- We will!

35:30.607 --> 35:32.598
Bye, Rushon.

35:39.487 --> 35:41.717
Let me see who that is.
It might be important.

35:41.887 --> 35:44.606
Hold on, now. Hello?

35:44.767 --> 35:46.325
Hey, Nik.

35:46.487 --> 35:47.920
Yeah?

35:48.087 --> 35:49.998
All right. He"II be right out.

35:50.287 --> 35:54.360
L"m not going anywhere, you hear me?
We spent $38 on those condoms.

35:54.527 --> 35:56.324
I don"t want to go out again.

35:56.487 --> 35:58.796
L"m hot, l"m bothered.
I might hurt somebody.

35:58.967 --> 36:01.925
- Not you. Because I don"t hit women.
- Relax. Look.

36:02.087 --> 36:04.647
I am gonna turn you
every which way but loose.

36:04.847 --> 36:08.237
- That"s what l"m talking about.
- After you buy...

36:08.407 --> 36:10.523
...a latex condom, okay?

36:12.527 --> 36:13.960
- Okay.
- Good.

36:14.127 --> 36:16.436
- When I come back, we doing this.
- Oh, yeah.

36:16.607 --> 36:19.519
We doing this. Do you understand?
No phone ringing.

36:19.687 --> 36:22.360
If the Avon lady"s at the door,
l"II bust her ass...

36:22.527 --> 36:25.599
...unless she got some condoms.
All right?

36:25.767 --> 36:28.998
Why don"t we just wait on
the Avon lady.

36:29.207 --> 36:30.799
Go.

36:30.967 --> 36:33.003
It"s so dark outside.

36:35.447 --> 36:37.165
Can you believe this?

36:37.327 --> 36:40.364
Bet he"s with Yoyo painting
stripes on that tiger penis.

36:40.527 --> 36:42.802
She need to be hanging
with this jungle snake.

36:42.967 --> 36:46.198
- What are we gonna do now?
- What we gonna do? No, no.

36:46.367 --> 36:48.756
What you gonna do?
Because I have mine going on.

36:48.927 --> 36:51.805
And if this dog don"t quit
sniffing on my boots...

36:51.967 --> 36:54.800
...l"m gonna show you
the true meaning of doggystyle.

37:06.727 --> 37:10.117
- Rushon. Oh, my God, my man main.
- Singh, my nigga.

37:10.327 --> 37:12.363
- Aren"t you on 125th Street?
- L"m a floater.

37:12.527 --> 37:15.837
I work at Harlem, Chinatown, Hunt"s
Point, Coney Island, Hell"s Kitchen.

37:16.007 --> 37:17.838
I don"t give a shit. L"m a floater.

37:18.007 --> 37:19.486
No dogs allowed, my friend.

37:19.647 --> 37:21.877
No, my brother,
that"s a Seeing Eye dog.

37:22.047 --> 37:25.323
Well, see his nasty little rodent ass
out to the curb.

37:25.487 --> 37:28.559
- He"s got a point, my friend.
- You"re looking at the dog"s ass?

37:28.767 --> 37:30.485
He"s got a point too. One to one.

37:30.647 --> 37:33.639
- What? L"m on your side.
- You started this shit.

37:33.847 --> 37:35.485
- Y"all got some kerosene?
- Aisle two.

37:35.647 --> 37:37.365
- Aisle three.
- You moved the kerosene.

37:37.527 --> 37:39.563
- Tell me when you move things.
- Do I have to?

37:39.727 --> 37:42.241
L"d like to fuck the dog.
Do I have to tell you that?

37:52.287 --> 37:55.882
Singh, I need some latex condoms.
Okay? They gotta be latex.

37:56.047 --> 37:58.686
Mr. Black Man, I can"t see you.
Come to the front.

37:58.847 --> 38:02.362
You came to the right place.
We have Ginza, Sheik, Hot Tamale.

38:02.527 --> 38:04.324
Booty Call, Backdoor Man,
Manhandlers.

38:04.487 --> 38:06.079
Ramrod, Lube Job, In Deep.

38:06.247 --> 38:08.477
Joy Trail, Buckwild
and Goodyear Eagles.

38:08.687 --> 38:10.405
Goodyear got a condom too?

38:10.567 --> 38:13.718
- Non-skid, maxi-tread.
- Give me the Sheik. No offence.

38:13.887 --> 38:17.038
Let me get the same thing he"s got,
and also get some Backdoors.

38:17.207 --> 38:19.767
- Oh, my God.
- I don"t think you want them.

38:19.927 --> 38:22.282
- They"re for gay men.
- Don"t wanna go there.

38:22.447 --> 38:25.598
I don"t know. You could be
a bit of a doo-doo chaser.

38:25.767 --> 38:27.359
A sodomite, with hair like that.

38:27.527 --> 38:29.199
Hell, no. Y"all got me fucked up.

38:29.367 --> 38:31.483
I like the fuzzy stuff,
don"t get me wrong.

38:31.647 --> 38:33.842
My hair is just a statement
of my individuality.

38:34.007 --> 38:36.680
- Like I said, a sodomite.
- Or sodo-maybe.

38:36.847 --> 38:39.042
- Very good. High-two.
- Oh, yeah. High-two.

38:40.127 --> 38:42.038
- Where are your condoms, man?
- Over there.

38:42.207 --> 38:44.004
And l"m watching you.

38:44.167 --> 38:45.680
Mind your business.

38:45.887 --> 38:48.640
- What"s a sodomite, anyway?
- You don"t wanna know.

38:48.807 --> 38:52.402
I thought he was saying I was, like,
Dolemite"s cousin or something.

38:52.567 --> 38:54.444
Damn. I forgot Killa.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.680
Shit.

38:57.847 --> 38:59.326
Hold.

39:00.367 --> 39:02.164
Killa.

39:03.487 --> 39:05.876
Come here. Killa.

39:07.327 --> 39:09.761
No, you gotta be firm with them.
Heel!

39:11.127 --> 39:13.721
- Damn!
- Oh, shit. Come here.

39:14.687 --> 39:18.566
Girl, that"s right. He is out
right now taking care of Killa.

39:18.727 --> 39:23.198
Looks like Rushon has worked
his way right on in, huh?

39:23.367 --> 39:24.880
Honey, let me tell you, my man...

39:25.047 --> 39:28.084
...has earned everything
l"m about to give him.

39:31.247 --> 39:33.715
Come here, come here,
you little mutt!

39:54.567 --> 39:56.762
I hate dogs.

40:03.967 --> 40:07.755
Okay, Bunz, I got it. L"II tell Nikki
Killa"s with you and Lysterine.

40:07.927 --> 40:10.566
- That way we can still get busy...
- Wait, wait.

40:10.727 --> 40:13.002
I will not get caught up
in your web of deception.

40:13.167 --> 40:15.556
There"s one thing I don"t do,
and that"s lie.

40:15.727 --> 40:18.480
All right, when Nikki
is crying on Lysterine"s shoulder...

40:18.647 --> 40:22.037
...then what you gonna do?
- Let"s get our story straight.

40:26.647 --> 40:28.763
No story required. Come on, B.

40:33.047 --> 40:35.277
What happened?
What took you guys so long?

40:35.927 --> 40:39.078
Me and Killa started playing
and lost track of time.

40:39.247 --> 40:41.203
This dog is so frisky. You hear me?

40:41.647 --> 40:43.558
Is there something on his sweater?

40:44.007 --> 40:45.281
No.

40:45.447 --> 40:48.041
Nothing on this sweater.
It"s a little shadowy in here.

40:48.207 --> 40:50.004
You know it"s getting late.

40:50.167 --> 40:51.566
Look at this!

40:51.727 --> 40:53.479
Is that a strong dog or what?

40:53.727 --> 40:56.924
Your dog is a trip, girl.
L"m telling you.

40:57.087 --> 40:59.999
Are you gonna play with him all night
or come play with me?

41:00.207 --> 41:03.324
L"II be right in there with you.
Go ahead. Just go in there.

41:03.487 --> 41:05.796
- L"II be in there.
- Okay.

41:05.967 --> 41:07.605
Don"t take too long.

41:10.567 --> 41:12.717
Make me get nothing.

41:16.087 --> 41:19.602
Rushon, what"s taking so long?

41:32.167 --> 41:33.725
What are you supposed to be?

41:33.887 --> 41:37.243
Jurassic Park, baby.
Getting prehistoric in here on you.

41:39.007 --> 41:40.884
Come here, girl.

41:58.687 --> 42:00.325
What are you doing?

42:00.487 --> 42:02.682
Going downtown, baby,
on the A train.

42:02.847 --> 42:05.042
Yeah, that"s great. That"s wonderful.

42:05.207 --> 42:07.118
Don"t you think we need
some protection?

42:07.287 --> 42:09.801
I just went to the store.
I got that. Don"t worry.

42:09.967 --> 42:13.243
You need a dental dam to protect
against the exchange of bodily fluid.

42:13.407 --> 42:16.524
Where do I get some dental dam?
I been to the store.

42:16.687 --> 42:19.121
Plastic wrap in the kitchen
next to the refrigerator.

42:19.287 --> 42:20.606
- In the kitchen.
- All right.

42:20.767 --> 42:22.723
Hurry up. Hurry.

42:22.887 --> 42:25.082
- Okay.
- Clears another hurdle.

42:25.247 --> 42:27.397
Didn"t know I was in the Olympics,
did you?

42:29.047 --> 42:33.518
- Don"t tear up my kitchen, now.
- I got it. Dam. Here you go.

42:34.527 --> 42:37.360
Well, don"t look like
we be going downtown.

42:37.527 --> 42:41.315
- That"s okay, babe.
- It"s not. I want you to go downtown.

42:41.487 --> 42:44.160
See, if you go to the store...

42:45.927 --> 42:48.202
...then when you come back...

42:48.687 --> 42:50.439
...you do me...

42:51.247 --> 42:52.965
...and l"II do you.

42:53.127 --> 42:56.164
Yeah, but the store"s a long way...

42:57.927 --> 42:59.440
Okay.

42:59.607 --> 43:01.279
To the store.

43:03.807 --> 43:06.275
It"s one thing we"re leaving
to go get rubbers.

43:06.447 --> 43:09.359
It"s another thing to get
plastic wrap for shit I don"t do.

43:09.527 --> 43:12.724
Hey, I might hurt you.
You"re my friend, but I might hurt you.

43:15.967 --> 43:19.243
Hey, man. You poked me in the eye.
Cut that shit down.

43:19.407 --> 43:22.877
- Look. The butt-plugs are back.
- You got any plastic wrap?

43:23.727 --> 43:27.003
Yeah, in the back,
next to the onions.

43:27.847 --> 43:30.839
All right. What"s so funny?

43:34.167 --> 43:37.398
You got to lick it
Before you kick it

43:37.567 --> 43:40.923
You"ve got to mak e it soft and wet
Before you stick it

43:41.127 --> 43:43.880
Hey, hey, camel cowboys.

43:44.047 --> 43:46.481
We just want some wrap,
and then we out of here.

43:46.687 --> 43:51.715
Oh, yeah. No. Most people come in
to buy GLAD Wrap at 2 in the morning.

43:51.887 --> 43:55.243
You got to punch it
Before you munch it

43:55.407 --> 43:59.195
You"ve got to work it
Before you jerk it

44:04.687 --> 44:07.520
See? See? This is why
l"m in favour of immigration reform.

44:07.687 --> 44:10.326
You"re fresh off the boat
and already fucking with people.

44:10.487 --> 44:12.762
Oh, my God, take a breather.

44:13.527 --> 44:15.882
- You feel better?
- I feel better.

44:16.047 --> 44:17.844
I was just pulling your arm.

44:18.007 --> 44:19.281
- Pulling your leg.
- Arm.

44:19.447 --> 44:21.961
- You can"t say " pulling your arm."
- Why do you correct me?

44:22.127 --> 44:25.244
- You are not in Bombay now.
- I wish I was in Bombay.

44:25.407 --> 44:27.204
- Then go to Bombay.
- L"m not staying.

44:27.407 --> 44:30.444
See who we get it from now?
The cold part is they got a point.

44:30.607 --> 44:32.802
These women are running us.
We not running them.

44:32.967 --> 44:35.003
Do you see how expensive
this shit is?

44:35.167 --> 44:37.920
- Singh, you got anything cheaper?
- Rushon.

44:38.687 --> 44:42.202
- Come up here, boy.
- Damn. Judge Peabody.

44:42.367 --> 44:45.439
He go to my mother"s church.
He a Holy Roller too.

44:46.807 --> 44:50.482
- Hey, judge.
- Rushon, what you doing out?

44:50.767 --> 44:52.723
We just came to get a sandwich.

44:52.887 --> 44:55.196
Ain"t nothing out this late
but the devil...

44:55.367 --> 44:58.564
...and the devil"s helper.
- Hey, judge.

45:00.687 --> 45:02.757
You want that GLAD Wrap?

45:03.127 --> 45:05.436
GLAD Wrap at 2 in the morning?

45:05.847 --> 45:08.361
Looks like you plan on eating
more than a sandwich.

45:08.527 --> 45:10.279
Your mother know
what you"re doing?

45:10.447 --> 45:12.244
- Well, she...
- Look here, son.

45:12.407 --> 45:16.116
It"s bad enough you plan to fornicate.
Don"t compound the crime by lying.

45:16.287 --> 45:20.041
Lies are the oil that grease the track.
One-way to "desolution."

45:20.207 --> 45:21.720
Now, I know...

45:21.887 --> 45:24.924
...what condoms and GLAD Wrap,
it has its place...

45:25.087 --> 45:27.157
...in the pantheon of safe sex.

45:27.327 --> 45:29.602
There"s only one way
to be totally safe...

45:29.767 --> 45:32.327
...and that"s abstinence and purity.

45:32.487 --> 45:36.275
- And sexual frustration.
- I know how you all feel.

45:36.447 --> 45:39.405
When that furry temptress
seems like she"s calling your name.

45:39.567 --> 45:42.559
She say, " Come on, Rushon!
Get some! Put your hand on it!

45:42.727 --> 45:44.718
You want some more?
Rub it on in there.

45:44.887 --> 45:46.400
You want me to rub it?
Bite me.

45:46.567 --> 45:49.843
Suck it, you filthy..."
You know, and things like that.

45:50.007 --> 45:51.520
You know?

45:51.687 --> 45:54.121
Man, you got my nipples hard.

45:55.047 --> 45:57.197
Watch how you talk to me.

45:57.407 --> 45:59.967
- L"m sorry.
- L"m sorry for you.

46:00.127 --> 46:01.845
L"m trying to help you.

46:02.007 --> 46:03.520
That"s where you gotta be strong.

46:03.687 --> 46:05.325
You have to take a pledge.

46:05.487 --> 46:09.480
You say, " I swear on the seal
of this great state of New York...

46:09.687 --> 46:13.839
...that I would never..."
- Say, judge, we gonna do this or what?

46:14.207 --> 46:17.597
Yes. Yes, l"II be right out, miss.

46:17.767 --> 46:19.359
L"II be right out.

46:21.327 --> 46:23.636
That"s what l"m talking about.

46:23.807 --> 46:26.241
So remember what I said...

46:26.407 --> 46:27.806
...because I said it.

46:28.487 --> 46:31.160
And tell your mother I say hello.

46:31.327 --> 46:32.726
You-all have a great evening.

46:32.927 --> 46:34.963
Judge, you forgot your Goodyears.

46:35.527 --> 46:40.442
L"II come back and get it.
I have to take my clerk home.

46:40.767 --> 46:43.406
I told you I was coming out.
Didn"t have to come in there.

46:44.207 --> 46:47.836
Look, man, l"m a little low on cash.
Y"all got anything cheaper?

46:48.047 --> 46:50.720
That"s the 300.
The 100 is back on the shelf.

46:51.287 --> 46:53.960
Come on, man.
We running out of time.

46:54.567 --> 46:56.046
I don"t trust those boys.

46:56.207 --> 46:59.597
I think that that girl was
the judge"s fuzzy temptress.

46:59.767 --> 47:01.644
- Furry temptress.
- What"s the difference?

47:01.807 --> 47:03.525
What"s the difference?
You don"t know?

47:03.687 --> 47:05.598
- Put the money in the bag.
- We are talking.

47:05.767 --> 47:07.962
- Lf furry is here and fuzzy is here...
- Hey!

47:08.127 --> 47:11.005
- I said, put the money in the bag.
- Your customer.

47:11.167 --> 47:13.556
Listen, you Pakistani piece of shit,
do what I say.

47:13.727 --> 47:16.639
Listen, you crack addict,
we"re not Pakistani. We are Punjabis.

47:16.807 --> 47:18.525
I could pass for Pakistani.

47:18.687 --> 47:21.997
Oh, shit, Bunz, these motherfuckers
are getting jacked.

47:22.967 --> 47:26.357
As soon as he shoots them,
l"m gonna go get some groceries.

47:26.847 --> 47:30.726
- Ever use the left side of your brain?
- All the time. Take these.

47:38.607 --> 47:41.838
Hey, let"s clock this motherfucker.

47:42.647 --> 47:45.161
Hurry up.
Give me the goddamn money.

47:49.207 --> 47:50.686
Call me a Pakistani.

48:15.527 --> 48:18.997
Oh, my, my, my, my, my.
Oh, my, my, my.

48:19.167 --> 48:23.080
- And you wonder why you"re a floater.
- Are you out of your fucking minds?

48:25.287 --> 48:26.766
Punk motherfucker.

48:27.327 --> 48:29.204
Bunz, you all right?

48:29.647 --> 48:32.241
I think I got a pickle
stuck in my ass.

48:33.287 --> 48:34.879
There we go.

48:38.047 --> 48:39.366
Tonight.

48:39.527 --> 48:43.076
- I ain"t coming back out here.
- That"s the spirit. Bunz.

48:43.927 --> 48:45.997
- What?
- Got a little something in here.

48:46.167 --> 48:48.283
- Man, you wacked.
- Straighten you out.

48:50.327 --> 48:53.444
Nikki, your man"s home.

48:53.927 --> 48:55.918
I don"t wanna hear it.

48:56.287 --> 48:59.120
L"m in the bathroom.
Why don"t you get ready.

48:59.327 --> 49:02.080
I am ready, girl. I been ready.

49:02.247 --> 49:04.203
Seven weeks ready. Shit.

49:04.367 --> 49:06.039
Hey, Nikki.

49:06.207 --> 49:09.916
This plastic ain"t easy to come by.
You don"t know what I been through.

49:10.087 --> 49:13.921
But I think I finally got
this safe-sex thing down pat.

49:14.087 --> 49:15.805
You sure you know what you"re doing?

49:15.967 --> 49:18.117
Do I know what l"m doing?

49:18.807 --> 49:20.445
I know what l"m doing.

49:20.607 --> 49:23.075
Say you want some dental dam,
I got your dental dam.

49:23.247 --> 49:25.966
Build your ass the Hoover Dam,
that"s what l"II do.

49:26.127 --> 49:29.563
L"II whack that ass tonight.
My turn to do what I want.

49:29.727 --> 49:33.242
You shut up before I wrap
your ass like a hot dog.

50:02.367 --> 50:05.484
Oh, my God. Rushon, Rushon.

50:07.247 --> 50:08.839
Sit up so you can get some air.

50:09.167 --> 50:10.441
Sit up.

50:10.607 --> 50:12.677
Okay, okay, okay.

50:12.847 --> 50:15.042
You gotta breathe. Let me help you.

50:15.207 --> 50:19.439
You are supposed to put this
around my pelvic area, not your head.

50:19.607 --> 50:22.326
Sorry, babe. Let"s do this.

50:22.487 --> 50:24.637
- " Let"s do this"?
- L"m fired up now.

50:24.847 --> 50:27.645
Rushon, you almost died.

50:27.807 --> 50:31.004
Oh, my God, you are the only man
in this world I know...

50:31.167 --> 50:33.556
...dumb enough
to do something like this.

50:36.167 --> 50:38.158
Help a brother out.

50:44.087 --> 50:45.759
Get him up!

50:46.047 --> 50:47.765
Sit him up.

50:47.927 --> 50:49.440
- Rushon, help me.
- What?

50:49.607 --> 50:51.165
Pop it!

50:53.647 --> 50:56.923
Motherfucker, was you gonna wait
for me to turn into a butterfly?

50:57.087 --> 51:01.126
- Déjá vu.
- Would you lookie here.

51:01.327 --> 51:02.885
Oh, I been looking.

51:03.047 --> 51:05.880
You know, I told him
I was coming right back.

51:06.127 --> 51:09.278
Bunz, did you think
you were gonna spoil or something?

51:09.447 --> 51:12.086
L"ve got some aluminium foil
over in the cabinet too.

51:12.287 --> 51:16.838
I don"t wanna hit no woman,
but I tell you right now...

51:17.007 --> 51:19.965
When did this become Def Comedy
Jam? Nikki, what is so funny?

51:20.127 --> 51:24.359
- L"m sorry, baby.
- "L"m sorry, baby."Ain"t this a bitch.

51:24.527 --> 51:27.963
I ain"t never had to go through

51:28.127 --> 51:30.561
They got you slipping,

51:30.727 --> 51:33.082
- You with me?
- L"m out. Come on.

51:33.327 --> 51:36.239
- Rushon, where you going?
- L"m going home.

51:36.567 --> 51:39.286
It"s about time you handled
your business like a man.

51:39.447 --> 51:41.836
I still got time to make my booty call.

51:44.367 --> 51:47.518
Didn"t I tell you about this
blind-date stuff? Look at this shit.

51:47.687 --> 51:51.043
- Let"s get a cab and get out of here.
- Smartest thing you said all night.

51:51.207 --> 51:54.756
- Don"t look back. Just keep walking.
- We almost got shot over this shit.

51:54.927 --> 51:57.487
- Shot?
- You heard him. Shot. L"m out of here.

51:57.647 --> 51:59.205
- Let"s go. Cabbie!
- Wait.

51:59.367 --> 52:01.881
- Cabbie!
- Rushon, are you okay?

52:02.047 --> 52:05.039
- L"m still breathing, ain"t I?
- Lf you stay away from GLAD Wrap.

52:05.207 --> 52:07.562
- Lystie, come on.
- L"m gonna be right over here.

52:07.727 --> 52:09.558
Baby, I am so sorry.

52:09.727 --> 52:12.958
L"II make it up to you. L"II do anything.
We can go upstairs.

52:13.127 --> 52:14.879
Damn.

52:16.327 --> 52:19.319
If you"re thinking about trying
to get in good with me...

52:19.487 --> 52:22.047
...and kissing me all on my fingers,
forget that.

52:22.207 --> 52:24.675
- Forgotten.
- Cool.

52:24.847 --> 52:26.883
Can I get a damn cab?

52:27.047 --> 52:28.321
Damn!

52:28.487 --> 52:32.241
What does a brother have to do
to get a cab? Rushon, help me out.

52:32.407 --> 52:33.681
You say something, Bunz?

52:33.887 --> 52:35.684
I see what"s going on.

52:35.847 --> 52:39.840
Look like you gonna get yours before
sunrise. I guess you won the bet.

52:41.727 --> 52:43.558
What bet?

52:44.247 --> 52:45.839
Bunz?

52:46.127 --> 52:49.039
Could you repeat the question?
I got a bum ear.

52:49.727 --> 52:52.525
Baby, it"s just a figure of speech,
that"s all it is.

52:52.687 --> 52:55.918
Like, "How much you wanna bet l"II
be tapping that ass before sunrise?"

52:56.087 --> 52:57.918
That kind of figure of speech,
Rushon?

52:58.367 --> 53:01.006
- Did you have a bet going on?
- No.

53:01.207 --> 53:04.802
No. No. No, no. No, no. Hell, no.
That would be degrading.

53:05.007 --> 53:08.966
- Completely degrading.
- This was just a harmless challenge.

53:09.127 --> 53:10.765
- Exactly.
- Challenge.

53:10.927 --> 53:14.158
Like between guys, we talking
about bitches and ho"s and...

53:14.327 --> 53:17.285
- Bunz.
- Baby, that"s all right. I got it.

53:17.447 --> 53:20.200
It"s like a guy thing. Right?
Kind of like high-fiving?

53:20.407 --> 53:22.921
- Right.
- Like a high-five.

53:23.087 --> 53:25.840
Lystie, did you hear that?
It"s a guy thing.

53:26.007 --> 53:28.919
- I heard.
- Us girls have our thing too.

53:29.087 --> 53:31.920
Except it"s not a high-five.
It"s a high-one.

53:32.087 --> 53:35.716
- And to you too. Lystie, let"s go.
- Nikki, please...

53:35.887 --> 53:37.525
Rushon, you bet on me.

53:37.807 --> 53:40.719
Come on. You gonna listen to Bunz?
Nikki, Bunz is crazy.

53:40.887 --> 53:43.355
I would never do something like...
Look...

53:43.527 --> 53:45.722
- Would you listen to me, please?
- L"m listening.

53:46.007 --> 53:48.077
I fucked up. I mean, a little bit.

53:48.247 --> 53:51.523
Hey, look, hands. Hey, man,
l"m glad you stopped.

53:51.687 --> 53:53.564
- Look...
- You no steal my car!

53:53.727 --> 53:55.365
What"s up with the gun?

53:59.967 --> 54:02.720
You done fucked up now.
I ought to bust your ass right here.

54:02.887 --> 54:05.276
Sorry, I don"t wanna cork you.

54:07.967 --> 54:09.878
Shit!

54:11.367 --> 54:14.677
I gotta get the hell out, man.
Shit is too crazy.

54:14.847 --> 54:17.600
L"m gonna go back to Africa,
to the roots.

54:19.807 --> 54:22.526
Let"s take a bite of the Big Apple.
The night is young.

54:22.687 --> 54:24.723
The only place we"re going
is the hospital...

54:24.887 --> 54:28.243
...to get you stitched and cleaned up.
After that, we"re going home.

54:28.407 --> 54:31.160
This is only a flesh wound.
Look. See?

54:31.847 --> 54:35.601
Them old-school niggas could take,
like, four or five bullets to the ass...

54:35.767 --> 54:38.520
...not even worried about
going to the hospital.

54:38.687 --> 54:41.281
They don"t make niggas
like they used to. Rock-hard.

54:41.447 --> 54:43.324
I hurt my finger. Kiss it.

54:43.727 --> 54:48.198
Nikki, I made a mistake, okay?
L"m sorry.

54:48.367 --> 54:51.245
Welcome to another episode
of Slipping-Ass Brother.

54:51.407 --> 54:53.967
Caller, you"re on the line
from Alabama, what you think?

54:54.127 --> 54:57.597
Does the young buck in the back
know how to fetch and roll over too?

54:57.767 --> 55:00.327
Because he begs good as hell.

55:00.727 --> 55:04.197
Oh, yeah, that"s right, Rushon.
Straighten up for your boy.

55:04.687 --> 55:07.679
What will it take for you to shut up?

55:11.527 --> 55:13.677
It"s funny you ask.

55:15.167 --> 55:17.886
It"s a misunderstanding.
It was a bet, but it wasn"t a bet.

55:18.047 --> 55:19.400
Not now, Rushon.

55:19.567 --> 55:21.797
Like I said, it"s a flesh wound.

55:21.967 --> 55:24.003
We wanna make sure
it doesn"t get infected.

55:24.167 --> 55:27.876
Like I was saying, no insurance.

55:28.047 --> 55:30.845
Ain"t this a shame.
We in the richest country in the world...

55:31.007 --> 55:33.475
...the land of the brave,
the home of the beautiful...

55:33.647 --> 55:35.399
...and he can"t get his leg sewn up?

55:35.607 --> 55:37.484
This is not the time or the place.

55:37.687 --> 55:39.996
It is the place.
It says "Emergency."

55:40.167 --> 55:43.682
It doesn"t say" Emergency unless
you ain"t got no insurance card."

55:43.887 --> 55:46.447
- Bunz.
- Shut up.

55:46.727 --> 55:50.276
I tell you what, l"II go get you a parrot
to go with your peg leg.

55:51.087 --> 55:54.238
Look, I got insurance.
I just don"t have my card on me.

55:54.447 --> 55:56.324
No card, no cure.

55:56.687 --> 55:59.440
I don"t think you understand
the severity of this situation.

55:59.607 --> 56:00.926
This man has been shot.

56:01.087 --> 56:04.124
I don"t know where you received
your education, your training...

56:04.327 --> 56:06.283
Lystie. I apologize...

56:06.447 --> 56:08.517
...for my friends.
It"s been a long night.

56:08.727 --> 56:11.764
L"m sure there"s a procedure
to verify his insurance.

56:11.927 --> 56:14.999
We filled out all the forms,
all the information you need is here.

56:15.207 --> 56:17.767
Like I said, little Miss Fugee...

56:17.967 --> 56:20.322
...no card, no cure.

56:20.607 --> 56:24.441
Look, bitch, either you make the call
or l"m gonna come across that desk...

56:24.647 --> 56:27.320
...and snatch that horsehair wig
off your bald head.

56:27.487 --> 56:29.682
I will stick this clipboard
so far up your...

56:29.887 --> 56:31.400
Askins.

56:31.967 --> 56:34.356
Looking for... Rushon Askins?

56:34.567 --> 56:38.719
- Nigga, are you Rushon?
- Yeah, Rushon Askins, right here.

56:38.927 --> 56:40.838
- Rushon Askins.
- That"s what l"m asking.

56:41.007 --> 56:42.326
Fool, get your ass down.

56:42.567 --> 56:45.161
Okay, listen. We"ve already
pre-admitted this patient.

56:45.367 --> 56:46.925
Here"s his insurance forms.

56:47.087 --> 56:50.443
We need to get him down to triage
because his wounds are severe.

56:50.607 --> 56:53.838
Yes, Dr. Zevroloski.
But aren"t you the guy that...?

56:54.047 --> 56:55.958
Yes, I am.
L"m very attracted to you.

56:56.167 --> 56:58.761
These beautiful eyes,
those cheekbones, that smile.

56:58.967 --> 57:00.798
And I love that little moustache.

57:01.127 --> 57:03.402
But do something with the Chia Pet.

57:04.167 --> 57:07.762
Listen. You and your mama have
to wait behind the yellow line.

57:08.767 --> 57:10.644
- Mama?
- Yes, your motherfucking mama.

57:12.847 --> 57:14.166
He ain"t saying I look old.

57:14.767 --> 57:16.405
You sure you know
what you"re doing?

57:16.567 --> 57:20.276
I used to watch ER all the time
till they cut the brother"s part down.

57:20.447 --> 57:22.961
Somebody died,
they gonna try to blame it on him.

57:25.847 --> 57:28.725
Nurse, could you give me a hand?
My patient needs assistance.

57:28.887 --> 57:31.447
Sure, doctor.
Could you roll him over there, please?

57:31.607 --> 57:33.916
You know, I think
it"s just a flesh wound.

57:34.087 --> 57:37.443
- Please help me get him in the bed.
- Yeah, you do look frail.

57:38.127 --> 57:39.480
Okay, get you right up here.

57:39.647 --> 57:41.399
There we go.
What I wanna do is...

57:41.567 --> 57:43.637
...turn him around so you can see him.

57:43.807 --> 57:46.116
Now, the vital signs seem to be...

57:46.287 --> 57:48.642
...okay. The forehead fever...

57:48.807 --> 57:50.957
...is stable.

57:51.767 --> 57:53.837
Oh, look here. I got to run.

57:54.007 --> 57:55.998
I got a 1 -Adam-12 right down the hall.

57:56.207 --> 57:58.767
L"II leave you here with him.
You can handle this.

57:58.967 --> 58:01.879
Sure, Dr. Zevroloski.

58:02.087 --> 58:04.840
Well, Zevroloski was my first name.

58:05.047 --> 58:07.959
L"m part German, part Jamaican.
Ger-maican.

58:12.207 --> 58:14.357
Damn Caribbean medical schools.

58:15.327 --> 58:18.637
Doctor? Dr. Moore needs help
in Obstetrics. She"s having a baby.

58:18.807 --> 58:21.321
- It ain"t mine.
- No, it"s her patient.

58:22.127 --> 58:24.516
Well, let"s get it on.
Is she naked?

58:27.807 --> 58:29.957
It hurts good, doesn"t it?

58:30.127 --> 58:32.641
Here, l"m gonna give you
something for the pain.

58:35.767 --> 58:37.962
All right. It"s gonna help you relax.

58:38.127 --> 58:39.685
It might even make you drowsy.

58:39.847 --> 58:43.442
But you"re gonna feel
a whole lot better.

58:46.767 --> 58:48.166
Nice.

58:51.767 --> 58:53.485
Pleasant dreams.

58:58.007 --> 58:59.440
So, doctor, what"s the problem?

58:59.607 --> 59:02.758
My residency is in Emergency Peds.
I have no training in Obstetrics.

59:02.927 --> 59:04.963
The patient is multigravida,
experiencing...

59:05.127 --> 59:06.719
...aggravated lateral distension...

59:06.887 --> 59:09.276
...with a likelihood
of an oblique inguinal hernia...

59:09.447 --> 59:12.325
...impacting the peritoneum
and the epigastric artery.

59:12.487 --> 59:15.684
Ever go to Nell"s on ladies" night?
Because it"s free before 10...

59:15.847 --> 59:19.317
...and everything like that.
Got a brand-new DJ.

59:20.167 --> 59:23.477
Girl, don"t worry about it.
Let me tell you something about men.

59:23.687 --> 59:25.200
They"re only good for one thing.

59:25.367 --> 59:27.927
And most of the time,
they don"t even do that right.

59:28.087 --> 59:30.476
Talking all that mess
about how big they are...

59:30.687 --> 59:32.723
...how much stamina they got...

59:32.887 --> 59:35.447
...talking all that mess about,
"Whose is this?

59:35.607 --> 59:38.167
Whose is this? Whose is this?"

59:38.327 --> 59:41.319
You know what I tell them?
"You don"t even know him."

59:41.487 --> 59:44.638
But how they gonna bet on us
like we some dogs at a race track?

59:44.847 --> 59:46.405
Because they not human, baby.

59:46.567 --> 59:50.480
They may seem like it.
We both eat and breathe the same.

59:50.647 --> 59:53.719
But look at a brother like Bunz.
Does he act human?

59:53.887 --> 59:56.003
But you just slept with Bunz.

59:56.167 --> 59:57.759
Like I said...

59:57.927 --> 01:00:01.761
...they"re only good for one thing.
- Only good for one thing.

01:00:01.927 --> 01:00:03.918
Yes, you got it.

01:00:04.087 --> 01:00:07.557
L"II tell you another thing,
what you got to do is flip the script.

01:00:07.727 --> 01:00:10.241
Keep your freaky-deaky
happening on the DL.

01:00:10.407 --> 01:00:14.241
Be like, "Yeah, that"s right.
But it"s mine. It"s mine."

01:00:14.407 --> 01:00:17.444
That"s mine. Tear it up.
Yeah. Give it to me.

01:00:17.607 --> 01:00:19.598
Yeah. What"s my name?
What"s my name?

01:00:19.767 --> 01:00:22.884
We in a hospital. Hospital. Chill out.

01:00:23.327 --> 01:00:25.716
- We in a hospital. All right.
- All right.

01:00:25.927 --> 01:00:27.724
Okay. Tear it up.

01:00:33.287 --> 01:00:36.677
Contractions are 10 seconds apart.
Everything"s great.

01:00:36.847 --> 01:00:39.964
Everything"s fine.
And, you know, you looking...

01:00:41.087 --> 01:00:43.282
You looking pretty good.

01:00:43.647 --> 01:00:45.763
What you in for, boy?

01:00:49.647 --> 01:00:52.605
You lucky. I got bad pipes.

01:00:52.807 --> 01:00:56.117
- My balls is all congested.
- What are they gonna do?

01:00:56.327 --> 01:00:58.795
Un-congest them, I guess.

01:01:00.447 --> 01:01:03.757
It says here, "Testicular removal."

01:01:04.407 --> 01:01:06.523
Un-congest them, my ass.

01:01:06.687 --> 01:01:09.076
- They"re gonna chop your balls off.
- What?

01:01:09.287 --> 01:01:11.642
Mr. Martin?

01:01:11.847 --> 01:01:13.200
Where are you?

01:01:13.407 --> 01:01:15.398
Mr. Martin...

01:01:15.607 --> 01:01:17.484
...where are you?

01:01:17.647 --> 01:01:19.763
We are ready.

01:01:25.327 --> 01:01:28.319
"Rushon." What a pretty name.

01:01:31.327 --> 01:01:33.682
Martin, here you are.

01:01:40.767 --> 01:01:42.803
Great evening.
Got any more planned?

01:01:42.967 --> 01:01:45.800
- Don"t even start on me.
- You don"t want me to start, darling.

01:01:45.967 --> 01:01:49.039
- What is that supposed to mean?
- What is that supposed to mean?

01:01:49.207 --> 01:01:50.481
We are in a hospital.

01:01:50.647 --> 01:01:53.081
Of course you don"t recognize me.
L"m Dr. Zevroloski!

01:01:53.287 --> 01:01:55.847
L"m in residency in Baltimore,
visiting doing research.

01:01:56.007 --> 01:01:58.396
- Hold it!
- Someone stole my ID.

01:01:58.567 --> 01:02:00.683
Zevroloski. Look it up.

01:02:00.887 --> 01:02:02.525
I knew it.

01:02:03.767 --> 01:02:05.359
You come with me.

01:02:05.887 --> 01:02:08.196
We got somebody to find.

01:02:09.207 --> 01:02:11.675
I know they"re in here somewhere.

01:02:14.647 --> 01:02:17.320
No. This is a mistake.

01:02:18.687 --> 01:02:20.643
Man, I swear to God.

01:02:20.807 --> 01:02:23.844
- We should just leave.
- No, we find them and then leave them.

01:02:34.007 --> 01:02:35.804
What is wrong with you?

01:02:35.967 --> 01:02:38.037
Relax.

01:02:38.247 --> 01:02:41.683
- This is a mistake.
- Now, everyone gets a little nervous...

01:02:41.847 --> 01:02:43.121
...about this procedure.

01:02:43.447 --> 01:02:46.041
It"s easy. First we shave you...

01:02:46.207 --> 01:02:48.004
...then we snip you and it"s over.

01:02:48.207 --> 01:02:50.960
There is life after castration.

01:02:52.567 --> 01:02:54.205
Let"s go.

01:03:08.167 --> 01:03:10.237
Well, the plumbing works.

01:03:12.927 --> 01:03:15.236
Look, I gotta go.

01:03:16.447 --> 01:03:18.642
- Where"s Rushon?
- I don"t know.

01:03:18.807 --> 01:03:21.275
- You lost Rushon?
- I didn"t lose him. I just...

01:03:21.447 --> 01:03:23.961
Look, I don"t have time for this.
L"II go look for him.

01:03:24.127 --> 01:03:27.164
You try to find him, please.
Girlfriend, keep an eye on him.

01:03:27.367 --> 01:03:30.518
All right, Mr. Martin,
we"ve already started anaesthesia.

01:03:30.687 --> 01:03:33.918
You haven"t eaten
in the last 12 hours, right?

01:03:34.247 --> 01:03:37.364
Just relax and start counting
backwards from 100.

01:03:37.927 --> 01:03:39.724
Don"t take my johnson.

01:03:39.887 --> 01:03:41.957
Don"t take...

01:03:42.407 --> 01:03:45.285
All right, people, he"s out cold.
Let us tango.

01:03:45.487 --> 01:03:46.920
Is he in there?

01:03:47.087 --> 01:03:49.555
- Thought I looked like a mama.
- I like older women.

01:03:49.767 --> 01:03:51.325
You trying to say I look old?

01:03:51.487 --> 01:03:54.604
No, l"m saying you
like a fine wine. You just aged.

01:03:54.807 --> 01:03:56.559
Check in there.

01:03:58.327 --> 01:04:00.557
Oh, snap. Chia Pet.

01:04:10.127 --> 01:04:13.085
It"s fine, it"s fine. Stop.

01:04:15.407 --> 01:04:17.841
All right, she"s gone. Let"s go.

01:04:18.247 --> 01:04:20.203
Yeah, let"s go.

01:04:20.407 --> 01:04:24.241
- You probably ain"t even ready for this.
- No, you ain"t ready for this.

01:04:26.007 --> 01:04:27.998
- Here we go.
- Wait a minute.

01:04:28.167 --> 01:04:29.805
Why hasn"t this man been prepped?

01:04:29.967 --> 01:04:34.040
It doesn"t matter. We all make
mistakes. L"II do it myself. Razor.

01:04:45.727 --> 01:04:50.164
Who"s your daddy? Who"s your daddy?
Who"s your daddy? Come up here, girl.

01:04:51.167 --> 01:04:54.443
Bunz, wait. Look, look.
Somebody"s in here.

01:04:55.087 --> 01:04:57.442
That jack-o"-lantern fool
is dead to the world.

01:04:57.607 --> 01:04:59.279
Come on, girl, let"s do this, now.

01:04:59.447 --> 01:05:00.846
Come on.

01:05:10.087 --> 01:05:11.998
Okay, now, come on.

01:05:12.167 --> 01:05:16.365
I hope you ate your corn flakes, baby,
because l"m gonna go all night long.

01:05:16.607 --> 01:05:18.040
Because I got stamina.

01:05:19.847 --> 01:05:23.681
Wait. You got a condom, right?
No glove, no love.

01:05:26.647 --> 01:05:28.558
Look, I got a glove right here.

01:05:28.807 --> 01:05:31.116
May not be big enough to fit
on this big paloosa...

01:05:31.327 --> 01:05:34.205
...but we"II do the best we can.
There we go.

01:05:34.807 --> 01:05:37.241
Are you ready?
Wait. Okay.

01:05:37.447 --> 01:05:39.403
Line it up.

01:05:42.207 --> 01:05:44.118
Oh, yes.

01:05:44.287 --> 01:05:46.357
Don"t go too fast, now.

01:05:54.487 --> 01:05:56.398
Oh, shit.

01:05:56.847 --> 01:05:59.725
No, you didn"t.

01:06:00.567 --> 01:06:02.762
I been holding that one a long time.

01:06:05.047 --> 01:06:06.446
That"s just a flare, baby.

01:06:08.167 --> 01:06:10.123
Damn, my crippled ass...

01:06:10.327 --> 01:06:13.319
...could"ve rolled around in her coochie
longer than that.

01:06:13.487 --> 01:06:17.321
He"s been watching us the whole time.
The whole three...

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:19.240
...seconds.

01:06:22.487 --> 01:06:24.364
I hope I didn"t wear you out, now.

01:06:24.967 --> 01:06:27.686
You need a cigarette
or something to bring you down?

01:06:43.967 --> 01:06:45.719
Oh, my God, what are you doing?

01:06:46.527 --> 01:06:49.325
L"m removing a metastasised
testicular growth.

01:06:49.527 --> 01:06:52.360
- Lf you"II excuse me...
- What? Don"t touch his growth!

01:06:52.767 --> 01:06:55.406
- Get her out of here.
- There"s been a mistake!

01:06:55.567 --> 01:06:56.966
He doesn"t have insurance!

01:06:57.727 --> 01:06:59.160
Fuck!

01:06:59.407 --> 01:07:02.285
Get him down to County!
Goddamn stupid Admissions.

01:07:02.487 --> 01:07:03.840
L"II be on the golf course.

01:07:04.287 --> 01:07:06.801
Son of a bitch!

01:07:12.047 --> 01:07:14.481
- Hey, baby.
- Hi, Rushon.

01:07:16.287 --> 01:07:19.882
- My leg... Oh, shit!
- Don"t worry, everything"s still there.

01:07:20.087 --> 01:07:22.157
- Almost.
- Almost? What you mean, "almost"?

01:07:22.367 --> 01:07:24.562
Lay off the Magic Shave, brother man.

01:07:24.767 --> 01:07:28.965
Oh, my God, Nikki, no matter
what you do, don"t tell Bunz.

01:07:29.287 --> 01:07:32.484
Here we go again, worrying
about what Bunz is gonna think.

01:07:32.687 --> 01:07:36.362
Lord forbid you get embarrassed
in front of Bunz.

01:07:37.407 --> 01:07:39.443
That"s what l"m talking about, Rushon.

01:07:39.767 --> 01:07:43.157
Nikki, you mean everything to me,
but, come on, it"s...

01:07:43.367 --> 01:07:45.483
...where a brother got
to draw the line.

01:07:45.687 --> 01:07:48.724
And there comes a time where
a woman has got to draw the line.

01:07:49.087 --> 01:07:50.998
- Nikki.
- Rushon...

01:07:51.167 --> 01:07:54.398
...sun"s up,
you already lost the bet, what else?

01:07:54.607 --> 01:07:57.360
Hurry up. You definitely know how
to do that, Quick Draw.

01:07:59.727 --> 01:08:01.957
Hey! What"s up?

01:08:02.167 --> 01:08:04.681
- That"s what l"ve been asking.
- Mind your business.

01:08:04.887 --> 01:08:06.400
Big Daddy-Haddy Not-No.

01:08:06.567 --> 01:08:08.558
- What"s up, boy?
- What"s up, man?

01:08:08.767 --> 01:08:10.564
Looking good.
They stitched you up?

01:08:10.767 --> 01:08:14.123
- Your boy here, don"t sweat a thing.
- You took care of me, boy.

01:08:14.487 --> 01:08:17.763
Now that your boy is here,
l"m sure that you"II be fine.

01:08:18.167 --> 01:08:20.555
Me and Lystie are leaving. Come on.

01:08:20.727 --> 01:08:23.002
- Nikki.
- Forget them tricks. Let"s roll.

01:08:23.167 --> 01:08:25.680
Nik... Nikki.

01:08:25.886 --> 01:08:29.357
What do I gotta do to prove that
I don"t give a fuck what Bunz thinks?

01:08:29.767 --> 01:08:31.120
- Sorry, man.
- What is this?

01:08:31.287 --> 01:08:32.925
Kick a Brother in the Ding-Ding Day?

01:08:33.247 --> 01:08:36.125
The proof is in the doing,
not the saying.

01:08:37.247 --> 01:08:39.761
It"s getting late.
We"re going home.

01:08:42.527 --> 01:08:44.518
All right, fuck it!

01:08:46.966 --> 01:08:48.957
Bunz.

01:08:49.207 --> 01:08:52.596
Hey, dog, what you doing?
I don"t wanna know you like this.

01:08:52.767 --> 01:08:54.325
Rushon.

01:08:54.647 --> 01:08:57.764
You do look younger with your beard
all cut off and everything.

01:08:57.966 --> 01:09:01.403
"Not only am I a client,
but l"m also the president."

01:09:02.886 --> 01:09:05.354
Looks like a popcorn shrimp, man.

01:09:05.767 --> 01:09:07.758
Is that the best you can do?
Come on.

01:09:07.966 --> 01:09:10.481
Looks like a doorstop.

01:09:10.687 --> 01:09:14.316
And you gonna tell everybody we know
and embarrass the hell out of me, right?

01:09:14.527 --> 01:09:18.236
I got to. If I pull that,
would you get stronger?

01:09:18.687 --> 01:09:20.404
There you go, brother.

01:09:20.567 --> 01:09:22.478
You got a tight little ass.
Ass so tight...

01:09:22.687 --> 01:09:25.247
...you could squeeze a piece of coal
and shit a diamond.

01:09:25.407 --> 01:09:26.886
Look at you, boy.

01:09:28.727 --> 01:09:32.162
- Did you see what was going on?
- You need to stop joning, Speedy.

01:09:32.886 --> 01:09:35.845
We need to really keep that
on the down low.

01:09:36.046 --> 01:09:39.118
I been going through counselling.
I wanted to talk to you about it.

01:09:39.287 --> 01:09:41.926
You didn"t give me a chance to reach
my climacticness.

01:09:42.287 --> 01:09:44.720
- You just got excited, right?
- Yeah. I got excited.

01:09:44.886 --> 01:09:47.162
Step over to this side of the line
or what?

01:09:47.367 --> 01:09:49.358
And what"s over there for me?

01:09:50.046 --> 01:09:51.799
I love you over here.

01:10:01.007 --> 01:10:02.759
Look what they doing.

01:10:06.087 --> 01:10:08.647
Ready to go with me?
Wanna go home?

01:10:09.087 --> 01:10:10.361
My apartment.

01:10:10.527 --> 01:10:11.801
You with me?

01:10:12.007 --> 01:10:14.726
You sure?
Watch it, now.

01:10:15.167 --> 01:10:17.158
- Can"t touch the pork chop.
- Can"t touch.

01:10:17.367 --> 01:10:20.120
Can"t touch it. It"II bite you.

01:10:22.007 --> 01:10:24.680
That normally doesn"t happen to me,
but I had an accident.

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:28.721
A cat jumped in my lap and scratched
the left side of my shit.

01:10:28.927 --> 01:10:32.158
So on the left side, l"m not functional.
I gotta hit it to the right.

01:10:32.367 --> 01:10:35.245
- You could learn a lot from him.
- But I got this sports cream.

01:10:35.447 --> 01:10:38.723
I put it on and I am ready to go,
you know?

01:10:45.687 --> 01:10:48.918
Nikki, I am glad
you made me wait seven weeks.

01:10:49.807 --> 01:10:54.164
Do you think they used a razor or one
of those hair-removal creams on you?

01:10:54.567 --> 01:10:55.920
Razor.

01:10:58.247 --> 01:10:59.999
You sure you know
what you"re doing?

01:11:01.567 --> 01:11:03.398
Oh, yeah.

01:11:03.807 --> 01:11:05.206
Where is Killa?

01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:07.165
L"m sure Killa"s around somewhere.

01:11:07.687 --> 01:11:09.484
See? He"s not even bothering us.

01:11:09.687 --> 01:11:12.326
I told you you two would hit it off
and bond together.

01:11:12.527 --> 01:11:15.200
Me and Killa have come
to an understanding.

01:11:18.087 --> 01:11:20.806
I read this is supposed to be bad
for your kidneys.

01:11:22.887 --> 01:11:24.366
Unless you"re a professional...

01:11:24.567 --> 01:11:27.957
...you shouldn"t go around like this.
Careful. Tendonitis.

01:11:29.607 --> 01:11:34.203
- Let"s get this party started.
- Be gentle.

01:15:59.047 --> 01:16:01.038
