01:04.313 --> 01:05.566
Huh?

01:21.248 --> 01:23.797
Kenji. Kenji.
Aah!

01:24.001 --> 01:29.349
I'm paying you to clean the floors,
not stare off into space.

01:29.548 --> 01:33.598
I am sorry, Takagawa san,
but I got distracted.

01:35.012 --> 01:40.985
Sadly, that is why no one comes
to the museum anymore.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.563
Too many distractions.
No discipline.

01:44.771 --> 01:48.025
No respect for the old ways.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.235
Come with me. I will show you.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.993
But I saw...

02:05.584 --> 02:10.806
Behold, the Black Samurai.

02:15.927 --> 02:18.931
The Black Samurai.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.392
Never heard of him.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.854
The most fearsome warlord
in the history of Japan.

02:25.062 --> 02:28.066
Do you see what I am
getting at, Kenji?

02:29.066 --> 02:30.113
Uh...

02:30.317 --> 02:32.240
Yes, Takagawa san.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.492
You want me to mop in here.

02:34.696 --> 02:40.294
No, that this exhibit
could save the museum.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.088
What is happening?

03:15.028 --> 03:16.826
I live.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.658
Kenji, do something.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.163
<i>Bonsai!</i>

03:24.746 --> 03:26.214
Uh?

03:46.101 --> 03:51.528
The ghost of the Black Samurai
has returned.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.191
<i>Welcome to Shibuya Station.</i>

05:15.398 --> 05:17.651
<i>Now arriving on Track 5.</i>

05:19.277 --> 05:21.120
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

05:49.057 --> 05:51.606
Wow, we made it, gang.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.107
Shibuya Station.

05:53.311 --> 05:56.110
The most popular meeting
place in all of Tokyo.

05:56.314 --> 05:57.657
And I can see why.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.236
Everyone in Japan
is already here.

06:00.986 --> 06:02.488
But, like, wouldn't you know it?

06:02.696 --> 06:05.575
We're all out of Scooby Snacks.

06:19.504 --> 06:22.678
Scooby Snacks. Scooby Snacks.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.636
Way to go, Scoob.
A Scooby Snack vending machine.

06:27.095 --> 06:28.813
Like, it's the wave
of the future.

06:34.603 --> 06:36.901
Hey, I've got a text
message from Miyumi.

06:37.105 --> 06:40.735
She says, "Meet me at
the statue of Hachiko."

06:40.942 --> 06:43.786
Any idea what this Hachiko person
looks like?

06:43.987 --> 06:46.991
Let's see.
Hachiko. Hachiko.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.166
Hachiko. Take a picture.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.458
Hachiko.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.218
Like, check it out, Scoob.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.671
Hachiko's not a person,
he's a pooch.

07:00.879 --> 07:01.926
Here it is.

07:02.130 --> 07:05.680
Hachiko used to greet his master every
day when he came home on the train.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.136
One day his master died...

07:07.344 --> 07:09.563
...and Hachiko
spent the rest of his life...

07:09.763 --> 07:12.983
...waiting at the station
for his master to return.

07:13.475 --> 07:17.025
Wow, sounds like
he was one cool canine.

07:17.228 --> 07:21.449
Heh, heh. Hey, Scoob. Like, maybe
they'll put up a statue of you some day.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.823
Me? Oh, boy.

07:25.904 --> 07:29.954
Ta-da. Bow-wow. Ruff.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.832
Look at Scooby. What a ham.

07:39.250 --> 07:42.629
It's going to take more than that.
Huh?

07:42.837 --> 07:45.260
If you want to have a statue
of your own in Japan...

07:45.465 --> 07:48.139
...you must first become a legend.

07:48.343 --> 07:50.311
Just like Hachiko.

07:50.512 --> 07:53.061
Today, in honor of
his great loyalty...

07:53.264 --> 07:58.566
...his statue serves as a special
place for faithful friends to meet.

07:58.770 --> 08:01.273
Uh, I'm sorry, but have we met?

08:01.481 --> 08:03.324
Huh! You must be Miyumi.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.994
And you are Miss Daphne Blake.

08:06.194 --> 08:09.323
I have heard all about you
and the Scooby gang.

08:09.531 --> 08:10.999
What do you know, Scoob?

08:11.199 --> 08:14.749
Looks like our
reputation precedes us.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.339
Like, I hope that's a good thing.

08:17.539 --> 08:19.917
Heh-heh-heh.
Of course it is.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.547
Can I tell you a secret?

08:21.751 --> 08:25.676
I sometimes wish I could be a
member of the Scooby gang too.

08:25.880 --> 08:26.972
Like, tell you what.

08:27.173 --> 08:31.428
Next time there's a gruesome ghost up
in our grill, you've got first dibs.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.513
Uh-huh.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.395
Hey, don't worry, guys.

08:35.597 --> 08:37.942
We're not here to solve
any mysteries this time.

08:38.143 --> 08:41.864
We're here to watch Daphne compete
in the big martial-arts competition.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.862
I'm so honored
to be invited to the tournament.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.488
And so should you be.

08:46.693 --> 08:51.540
Miss Mirimoto runs the most exclusive
martial-arts academy in all the world.

08:51.740 --> 08:55.119
Only the most exemplary students
are accepted by her.

08:55.326 --> 08:59.456
But first, you must survive
the tournament.

09:00.915 --> 09:03.009
Survive?

09:03.752 --> 09:07.882
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I say "survive"?
Ha, ha. I meant "win."

09:08.089 --> 09:10.137
First, you must win
the tournament.

09:25.315 --> 09:26.988
Wow, what a sweet ride.

09:27.192 --> 09:30.366
All it needs
is a groovy green paint job.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.447
Uh, not quite, Freddy.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.703
I can think of one
more thing it needs.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.286
Like, how about a pilot?

09:37.494 --> 09:40.213
Huh?
Don't worry. We're perfectly safe.

09:40.413 --> 09:45.965
The hover jet is the world's first
fully functioning robotic plane.

09:46.169 --> 09:47.512
That's amazing.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.760
I've studied mechanical
engineering...

09:49.964 --> 09:52.387
...but I've never heard
of anything this advanced.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.266
Here in Japan, technology is
taking over everything...

09:55.470 --> 09:59.020
...while many of the old
traditions are fading away.

10:20.995 --> 10:25.546
Please, Miss Mirimoto,
you must believe me.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.970
The ghost of the Black Samurai
has returned.

10:29.170 --> 10:32.925
Soon, he will come
for the Destiny Scroll.

10:36.177 --> 10:40.148
A very entertaining story,
Mr. Takagawa.

10:40.348 --> 10:45.479
I am sure that it will bring many
new visitors to see your exhibit.

10:45.687 --> 10:49.988
Now, as you can see, our grand
tournament is about to begin.

10:50.191 --> 10:53.866
We would be most pleased
to have you join us.

10:54.070 --> 11:00.999
Sojo, please show our
honored guest to his seat.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.704
You must listen.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.175
The scroll...

11:07.625 --> 11:10.925
...must be protected.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.473
I can assure you, Mr. Takagawa...

11:13.673 --> 11:15.300
...ghost or no ghost...

11:15.508 --> 11:20.605
...the Destiny Scroll will be
quite safe behind these walls.

11:20.805 --> 11:23.979
If you say so.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.316
Sojo. Release him.

11:30.857 --> 11:33.235
You must forgive poor Sojo.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.696
He does only as he is told.

11:35.904 --> 11:39.283
His loyalty to me
is unquestioned.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.370
The plane.

11:43.578 --> 11:45.626
The plane.

11:52.378 --> 11:55.928
Ah, the last of our
guests to arrive.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.851
Have them report
to the staging ground immediately.

11:59.052 --> 12:02.147
We shall have a demonstration.

12:09.437 --> 12:12.281
Wow, what a beautiful airport.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.610
It's not an airport, Freddy.

12:14.817 --> 12:17.661
This is a traditional
Japanese garden.

12:20.782 --> 12:24.412
Can't you just feel the peace
and tranquility?

12:28.790 --> 12:30.542
Oh, yeah.

12:30.750 --> 12:34.880
Scoob, old buddy, like, from here
on out, no matter what happens...

12:35.088 --> 12:37.841
...I'm just gonna
go with the flow.

12:38.049 --> 12:41.223
Go with the flow.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.896
All must Wear uniform.

12:44.097 --> 12:48.068
Gulp! Like, my go-with-the-flow
just got up and went.

12:48.267 --> 12:49.735
Zoinks!

12:56.609 --> 12:58.907
No, Sojo. Bad, Sojo.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.956
Not them. Her.

13:02.156 --> 13:04.625
All must Wear uniform.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.578
Hyah!
Aah!

13:10.123 --> 13:13.798
Sorry, Sojo, but I handle
my own wardrobe.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.100
Ha-ha-ha. Check it out, Scoob.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.178
Like, it's a carnival of karate.

13:23.386 --> 13:25.059
Ooh! Uh-huh.

13:25.263 --> 13:27.857
The competition this
year is fierce.

13:28.057 --> 13:32.608
That's Kerry Kilpatrick,
the Irish national champion.

13:34.564 --> 13:37.568
He's a two-fisted
demolition dynamo.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.407
- Hyah!
- Sapphire Sonja.

13:40.611 --> 13:45.117
The only thing deadlier than
her kick is her beauty.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.456
- Rah!
- Zoinks!

13:47.660 --> 13:50.960
And that's Japan's own
Mad Dog Masimoto.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.041
A favorite to win this year.

13:53.249 --> 13:56.469
Once he's off his leash,
you're really in the doghouse.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.343
Huh!

14:17.607 --> 14:18.699
Gee whiz.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.870
Like, talk about a creep
with a canine complex.

14:22.070 --> 14:23.117
Yeah.

14:29.452 --> 14:32.376
Most honored participants...

14:32.580 --> 14:37.802
...welcome to Mirimoto Academy's
Tournament of Champions.

14:38.002 --> 14:40.721
The finest martial artists
in all the world...

14:40.922 --> 14:45.473
...have gathered here today
for one single purpose:

14:45.676 --> 14:49.431
to prove that they are the best.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.814
By this time tomorrow...

14:54.018 --> 14:59.616
...most of you will be sent home
in humiliating defeat.

15:03.111 --> 15:04.738
But there is one among you...

15:04.946 --> 15:08.917
...who has already displayed
the heart of a champion.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.745
Miss Daphne Blake?

15:14.414 --> 15:16.132
Um, over here.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.879
Hello.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.677
Can this be?

15:19.877 --> 15:21.675
The tournament has
not yet begun...

15:21.879 --> 15:26.225
...and already you have defeated
the mighty Sojo.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.805
I didn't mean to.
It's just that-- Eh--

15:30.012 --> 15:32.014
This is most impressive.

15:32.223 --> 15:33.975
Perhaps you would honor us...

15:34.183 --> 15:37.904
...with a demonstration
of your superior skill.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.232
As in right now?

15:40.439 --> 15:45.115
Your opponent will always attack
when you least expect it.

16:15.725 --> 16:16.977
Huh?

16:24.609 --> 16:28.785
Like, meow. Talk about a
kung-fu cat-fight, ha.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.116
Uh-huh. Meow.

16:52.595 --> 16:55.724
My hair band. I can't see.

16:57.892 --> 17:01.021
Hey, that was a dirty trick.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.482
The first rule of
Mirimoto Academy:

17:03.689 --> 17:04.736
If you want to win...

17:04.941 --> 17:09.037
...you must be willing to do that
which others are not willing to do.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.990
Most impressive, Miss Blake.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.825
You lack proper training...

17:14.032 --> 17:18.709
...but I see in you
much potential.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.634
The tournament begins tomorrow
at sunrise...

17:23.835 --> 17:29.012
...but tonight, a feast has
been prepared in your honor.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.060
Hear that, Scoob?

17:33.261 --> 17:34.763
Like, a feast in our honor.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.348
Oh, boy.

17:37.807 --> 17:41.732
Finally, something
worth fighting for.

18:10.339 --> 18:13.434
Boy, the service here is great...

18:14.427 --> 18:18.182
...but, uh, our waitress
sure could use a suntan.

18:18.389 --> 18:21.484
She's not a waitress, Freddy.
She's a geisha girl.

18:21.684 --> 18:26.155
Geisha, the ancient Japanese tradition
celebrating exquisite beauty.

18:26.355 --> 18:29.154
Speaking of beauty,
check out the buffet table.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.405
Oh, ho, ho!

18:30.610 --> 18:34.490
It's like there's a party in my
stomach and everything's invited.

18:34.697 --> 18:35.744
Yeah.

18:40.703 --> 18:41.829
Hyah!

18:49.170 --> 18:52.515
Ha-ha-ha. Like, you must be
a black belt in kung food.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.013
Yeah.

18:56.677 --> 19:00.807
Forget the karate chop.
Like, check out my karate chomp.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.278
Huh?

19:07.271 --> 19:09.273
Huh! Ninjas!

19:20.201 --> 19:24.627
Wow, real-life ninjas. How cool.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.003
I don't think these guys
are part of the act.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.093
Watch out.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.805
If it's a fight you
be looking for...

19:34.006 --> 19:36.555
...then you've found the bloke
to oblige you.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.061
Out of my way.

19:43.265 --> 19:46.735
Let Sapphire Sonja
show you how to kick it.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.747
Hmm?

20:17.883 --> 20:19.180
We're surrounded.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.364
Who's that?

20:36.569 --> 20:39.368
Gulp! Who cares?
Not me.

20:41.365 --> 20:42.617
Let's get out of here.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.484
Huh?

21:58.275 --> 21:59.697
Huh?

22:40.067 --> 22:41.489
Yipes!

22:41.694 --> 22:43.947
Like, I almost forgot.

22:44.155 --> 22:46.533
We're afraid of heights.

22:55.833 --> 22:58.803
Shaggy, look.

23:03.299 --> 23:05.017
At long last...

23:05.217 --> 23:10.815
...the Destiny Scroll is mine.

23:13.851 --> 23:16.229
Stop, thief.
Huh?

23:17.646 --> 23:20.525
You will not be
allowed to escape.

23:24.987 --> 23:27.115
You are too late.

23:27.323 --> 23:30.167
We shall let steel decide.

23:46.383 --> 23:47.430
Yipes!

23:59.563 --> 24:02.908
The Black Samurai
will live again...

24:03.108 --> 24:05.406
...forever!

24:12.076 --> 24:13.123
So it is true.

24:13.327 --> 24:16.706
The ghost of the Black Samurai
has returned.

24:16.914 --> 24:19.838
Gulp! Ghost?

24:21.502 --> 24:23.095
It just doesn't add up.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.969
The artwork in this collection
must be worth a fortune.

24:26.173 --> 24:29.723
So why go through all that trouble
just to steal one scroll?

24:29.927 --> 24:31.895
Well, gang,
it looks like we've landed...

24:32.096 --> 24:35.225
...smack dab
in the middle of another mystery.

24:35.432 --> 24:38.060
It is no mystery.

24:38.936 --> 24:44.033
The legend of the Black Samurai
has been told for centuries.

24:44.233 --> 24:46.952
May I present
Mr. Takagawa...

24:47.152 --> 24:52.329
...most honored curator from the
Tokyo Museum of Cultural History.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.748
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Takagawa.

24:54.952 --> 24:56.454
You'll have to excuse us.

24:56.662 --> 24:59.381
We don't really know much
about Japanese folklore.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.629
But ghosts are kind
of our specialty.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.552
Speak for yourself.

25:03.752 --> 25:07.006
My specialty is a triple-decker
Scooby Snack-and-ice-cream...

25:07.214 --> 25:08.716
...with-chocolate-sauce sandwich.

25:08.924 --> 25:11.052
Ha, ha. Mine too.

25:11.260 --> 25:12.307
Yum, yum, yum.

25:12.970 --> 25:15.598
The legend began
hundreds of years ago...

25:15.806 --> 25:19.185
...when fierce warriors
known as the samurai...

25:19.393 --> 25:24.490
...served the warlords of Japan
with absolute loyalty.

25:25.107 --> 25:27.155
<i>The most fearsome of all...</i>

25:27.359 --> 25:30.829
<i>...were the ronin, the samurai
who had lost his master.</i>

25:31.030 --> 25:35.410
<i>Set adrift, like a wave
on the open sea.</i>

25:37.786 --> 25:42.713
<i>One ronin sought out
the master swordmaker Masamune.</i>

25:42.917 --> 25:46.717
<i>The legendary master agreed
to forge the samurai...</i>

25:46.920 --> 25:49.969
<i>...a sword of great
mystical power...</i>

25:50.174 --> 25:55.476
<i>...but it would take an entire
year to complete the work.</i>

25:55.679 --> 25:59.024
<i>The master's evil-minded
apprentice, Muramasa...</i>

25:59.224 --> 26:06.153
<i>...offered to forge him another
sword, but in only half the time.</i>

26:13.739 --> 26:15.833
<i>The samurai returned...</i>

26:16.033 --> 26:18.957
<i>...and upon drawing the blade...</i>

26:19.161 --> 26:23.132
<i>...felt a surge of
uncontrollable dark power.</i>

26:23.332 --> 26:28.589
<i>The evil spirit of the apprentice
had passed into the blade itself.</i>

26:28.796 --> 26:31.015
<i>It was a sword of hatred.</i>

26:31.215 --> 26:33.058
<i>A sword of darkness.</i>

26:33.258 --> 26:36.262
<i>A Sword of Doom.</i>

26:36.470 --> 26:42.568
<i>And in that moment was born
the Black Samurai.</i>

26:46.605 --> 26:50.451
<i>Finally,
the master's blade was complete.</i>

26:50.651 --> 26:54.246
<i>He named it the Sword of Fate...</i>

26:54.446 --> 27:00.294
<i>...and entrusted its mystical
power to a fearsome green dragon.</i>

27:00.494 --> 27:04.795
<i>Heaven and earth trembled
as the two great swords clashed.</i>

27:09.419 --> 27:12.514
<i>Until, using his sacred magic...</i>

27:12.715 --> 27:16.345
<i>...the Green Dragon
defeated the Black Samurai...</i>

27:16.552 --> 27:22.059
<i>...imprisoning him forever
within the Sword of Doom.</i>

27:22.266 --> 27:26.442
No!

27:27.980 --> 27:34.659
Centuries passed,
and the story faded into legend.

27:34.862 --> 27:38.287
Wow, Mr. Takagawa,
that's some story.

27:39.575 --> 27:43.250
Like, story nothing.
That sounds more like a nightmare.

27:43.454 --> 27:45.422
Yeah.

27:46.290 --> 27:50.170
But what does all of this have
to do with the Destiny Scroll?

27:50.377 --> 27:53.551
The Destiny Scroll
holds the only clue...

27:53.755 --> 27:57.510
...to the secret location
of the Sword of Doom...

27:57.718 --> 28:01.268
...in the form of
an ancient riddle.

28:01.472 --> 28:04.021
If the ghost can solve
the riddle of the scroll...

28:04.224 --> 28:06.192
...he will reclaim
the Sword of Doom...

28:06.393 --> 28:09.772
...and free his evil spirit.

28:09.980 --> 28:12.403
If only we'd gotten a good look
at that scroll...

28:12.608 --> 28:14.986
...maybe we could have solved
the riddle first.

28:15.193 --> 28:18.493
Yeah, like, too bad
the scroll is gone.

28:18.697 --> 28:21.120
Aw, too bad.

28:21.325 --> 28:24.374
Heh-heh-heh. Guess that's
the end of this mystery.

28:24.578 --> 28:28.424
No, my friends,
the mystery has only begun.

28:33.879 --> 28:38.976
Huh! The Destiny Scroll.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.142
So the other scroll was a fake.

28:42.346 --> 28:44.940
Ha, ha. Psyche.

28:45.140 --> 28:49.270
Yes, but the Black Samurai
will soon realize the deception...

28:49.478 --> 28:51.572
...and return.

28:53.565 --> 28:56.114
I will translate the inscription.

28:56.318 --> 29:02.291
"The journey of a thousand miles
begins with a single step.

29:02.491 --> 29:05.620
The paper dragon shows the way."

29:05.827 --> 29:08.376
The journey of a
thousand miles...

29:08.580 --> 29:11.129
Begins with a single step?

29:11.333 --> 29:14.712
The paper dragon shows the way.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.797
I've got it.

29:17.005 --> 29:18.507
Like, check it out, Scoob.

29:18.715 --> 29:21.935
An origami octopus. Beat that.
Ha-ha-ha.

29:22.135 --> 29:23.603
Hmm...

29:26.932 --> 29:28.900
Look. Snowflakes.

29:32.312 --> 29:37.159
That's it. The paper dragon
must be a reference to origami...

29:37.359 --> 29:39.703
...the Japanese art
of folding paper.

29:39.903 --> 29:41.621
Velma's right.

29:41.822 --> 29:47.295
Okay, guys, give us an origami
dragon but this time use the scroll.

29:47.744 --> 29:48.961
No.

29:49.454 --> 29:52.503
Just a little tuck
here, a fold there.

29:52.708 --> 29:56.429
This goes under, that goes over.

29:59.256 --> 30:00.473
Ta-da!

30:02.134 --> 30:04.432
The words have been rearranged.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.855
Yes. It now reads:

30:07.055 --> 30:11.686
"The journey begins
with a thousand steps."

30:11.893 --> 30:14.737
The journey begins
with a thousand steps?

30:14.938 --> 30:16.281
How is that any different?

30:16.481 --> 30:19.735
Hang on, gang.
I think I've got something.

30:19.943 --> 30:22.662
The Temple of a Thousand Steps.

30:23.405 --> 30:24.657
Huh?

30:24.865 --> 30:30.338
An ancient ruin located on a remote
jungle island in the South Pacific Ocean.

30:30.537 --> 30:32.164
Yes. I've got it too.

30:32.372 --> 30:34.750
The island temple is devoted to...

30:36.209 --> 30:38.928
...the Green Dragon.

30:39.129 --> 30:42.508
The Sword of Doom
must be hidden in the temple.

30:42.716 --> 30:46.095
Then we've gotta find a way
to get to that island.

30:46.303 --> 30:48.726
<i>Sojo, ready the hover jet.
Hai.</i>

30:48.931 --> 30:54.108
Miyumi will accompany you on your
journey as my representative.

30:54.311 --> 30:56.279
Huh! Thank you, sensei.

30:56.480 --> 31:01.611
Mr. Takagawa, you will go along
as the team's translation expert.

31:01.818 --> 31:05.038
I will serve with distinction.

31:05.238 --> 31:08.082
A tropical-island vacation
in the sunny South Pacific?

31:09.701 --> 31:11.795
Like, now you're speaking
our language.

31:11.995 --> 31:13.463
Uh-huh.

31:22.339 --> 31:24.012
We should be getting close.

31:24.216 --> 31:27.015
I've uploaded the coordinates
into the navigation system...

31:27.219 --> 31:30.018
...using my laptop's
wireless interface.

31:30.472 --> 31:33.396
It's very exciting for me
to join you on this mystery.

31:33.600 --> 31:36.729
I'm usually not allowed to venture
so far from Miss Mirimoto.

31:36.937 --> 31:39.736
She seems like a
really great sensei.

31:39.940 --> 31:40.987
She is...

31:41.191 --> 31:44.821
...but she demands absolute
loyalty, like that of a samurai.

31:45.028 --> 31:46.075
Indeed.

31:46.279 --> 31:49.579
Someone who still cares
for the old ways.

31:49.783 --> 31:52.002
Yeah, like, the good old days...

31:52.202 --> 31:55.081
...when people chased each
other around with big swords.

31:55.288 --> 31:59.384
Pardon my saying so, but that
puts the mental in sentimental.

31:59.584 --> 32:01.052
Uh-huh.

32:05.632 --> 32:06.804
Here we go, gang.

32:12.472 --> 32:14.190
I can't see anything.

32:14.391 --> 32:17.270
It's like the whole world
just disappeared.

32:17.477 --> 32:21.778
Zoinks! Like, so much for our
sunny South Pacific vacation.

32:21.982 --> 32:25.077
The island should be right
in front of us.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.199
Whoa!

32:35.162 --> 32:37.085
Look, gang. There it is.

32:37.497 --> 32:41.127
The Temple of a Thousand Steps.

32:43.879 --> 32:46.177
Nine hundred and ninety-seven.

32:46.381 --> 32:48.600
Nine hundred and ninety-eight.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.098
Nine hundred and ninety-nine.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.146
One thousand.

32:53.346 --> 32:55.314
Phew! We made it, Scoob.

32:56.766 --> 33:00.191
Like, in your face,
Temple of a Thousand Steps.

33:00.395 --> 33:03.569
<i>Thousand Steps.</i>

33:03.774 --> 33:05.868
Yeah.

33:06.067 --> 33:10.493
Scooby-Dooby-- I'm pooped.

33:10.697 --> 33:12.290
We made it, gang.

33:12.491 --> 33:15.745
And check out that stone
carving above the temple door.

33:17.204 --> 33:19.457
The Green Dragon.

33:24.628 --> 33:27.222
Check out the
size of that disco ball.

33:27.422 --> 33:29.049
That's no disco ball, Shaggy.

33:29.257 --> 33:31.134
It's a Japanese lantern.

33:31.343 --> 33:34.973
Hey, maybe that's got something
to do with the next clue.

33:35.180 --> 33:40.311
Or maybe we should just say we
tried and, like, call it a day.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.192
Zoinks!

33:53.323 --> 33:54.370
Jinkies.

33:54.574 --> 33:57.453
Shaggy, you did it.
I did?

33:57.661 --> 33:59.584
I mean, I did.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.882
Like, what did I do, Scoob?

34:03.083 --> 34:04.756
I don't know.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.679
it looks like some
kind of treasure map.

34:07.879 --> 34:10.348
Showing the whole island.

34:10.549 --> 34:12.426
Is that the Sword of Doom?

34:12.634 --> 34:15.853
Huh! Yes, it must be.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.431
But it's on the other
side of the island.

34:18.639 --> 34:21.109
I will translate the inscription.

34:21.309 --> 34:26.690
"The secret falls
from the mouth of the dragon."

34:26.898 --> 34:28.445
Another dragon riddle?

34:28.650 --> 34:30.277
Uh, speaking of riddles...

34:30.485 --> 34:34.911
...like, does this mean
there's a cafeteria on this island?

34:41.496 --> 34:44.248
No. We must get out of here.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.377
Like, why?

34:49.254 --> 34:51.348
Hurry, before they catch us.

35:10.025 --> 35:11.868
Okay, everybody just stay calm...

35:12.068 --> 35:13.615
...and let me do all the talking.

35:15.697 --> 35:17.415
Hello there. Heh.

35:17.616 --> 35:19.994
We're from America.

35:22.954 --> 35:26.800
Like, how do we get ourselves
into these things?

35:29.169 --> 35:32.298
...Droo-ga-ga.

35:33.048 --> 35:36.769
Droo-ga-ga. Droo-ga-ga.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.436
"Droo-ga-ga"?

35:38.637 --> 35:41.607
It must be their name
for the Green Dragon.

35:41.807 --> 35:44.560
They are going to offer us
as a sacrifice.

35:46.978 --> 35:51.154
And I think we're going to be
married to that icky tribal chief.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.204
Ew.

35:57.405 --> 35:58.531
Not if I can help it.

35:58.740 --> 36:00.868
Miyumi, if you can
reach my bag...

36:01.076 --> 36:03.704
...I've got a plan to
save all our skins.

36:03.912 --> 36:05.380
Okay.

36:21.096 --> 36:23.599
Boy, you guys really know
how to cook...

36:25.433 --> 36:28.186
...hmm, but there's something
still missing.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.609
Huh?

36:36.736 --> 36:39.785
Mmm.
Hey, now that's more like it.

36:40.282 --> 36:42.626
Here, taste.

36:48.415 --> 36:52.966
Well, what are you waiting for?
Come on in, the water's fine.

36:54.796 --> 36:57.140
Like, now we're cooking.
Right, Scoob?

36:57.340 --> 36:58.387
Yeah.

37:10.353 --> 37:13.732
I mean, mmm! Yummy.

37:13.940 --> 37:16.409
Okay, that should do it.

37:16.610 --> 37:19.864
Now, just cover and
simmer for one hour.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.744
Huh?

37:28.538 --> 37:29.630
Zoinks!

37:29.831 --> 37:33.085
Ha, ha. That's the problem
with gourmet cooking nowadays.

37:33.293 --> 37:36.092
Like, everyone's a critic.

37:40.467 --> 37:43.346
Huh! Droo-ga-ga!

37:54.147 --> 37:56.115
Huh! You did it, Velma.

37:56.316 --> 37:58.364
Lucky for us the plane's
robotic navigator...

37:58.568 --> 38:00.787
...is still connected
to my wireless interface.

38:00.987 --> 38:03.866
The villagers must think the
hover jet is the Green Dragon.

38:04.074 --> 38:06.327
So, like, what are we dragging
our feet for?

38:06.534 --> 38:07.786
Come on.

38:32.519 --> 38:35.398
Look, how magnificent.

38:35.730 --> 38:39.280
The secret falls
from the mouth of the dragon.

38:39.484 --> 38:43.239
The riddle is
pointing to the waterfall.

38:43.446 --> 38:45.869
So, like, what do we do next?

38:46.408 --> 38:48.786
We go in for a closer look.

38:48.994 --> 38:52.715
Like, I was afraid
you were gonna say that.

39:14.102 --> 39:16.446
- Weird.
- Check it out.

39:18.356 --> 39:19.403
Huh?

39:26.239 --> 39:27.286
Come on, Scoob.

39:27.490 --> 39:29.242
There's nothing to be afraid of.

39:29.451 --> 39:30.498
Yeah, see?

39:30.702 --> 39:33.000
Like, they're only statues.

39:33.204 --> 39:35.582
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh!

39:35.790 --> 39:38.293
Would you come with us
for a Scooby Snack?

39:39.752 --> 39:41.504
Nope.

39:41.713 --> 39:44.512
Would you do it
for two Scooby Snacks?

39:44.716 --> 39:46.184
Uh-uh.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.182
How about 10 Scooby Snacks?

39:51.055 --> 39:53.228
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:54.893 --> 39:57.362
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

40:02.609 --> 40:05.704
Wow, look at this place.

40:06.446 --> 40:09.040
We've found it at last.

40:09.240 --> 40:12.995
The Sword of Doom.

40:16.539 --> 40:18.792
So, like, what are we waiting for?

40:19.000 --> 40:22.379
Let's grab the sword
and blow this pop stand.

40:22.587 --> 40:24.464
Uh-huh.

40:24.672 --> 40:26.174
I don't know, guys.

40:26.716 --> 40:29.890
Something doesn't feel right
about this.

40:30.095 --> 40:34.441
But Miss Mirimoto is expecting us
to bring the sword back to Japan.

40:35.892 --> 40:37.519
If you want to win...

40:37.727 --> 40:42.107
...you must be willing to do that
which others are not willing to do.

40:48.530 --> 40:50.203
Zoinks! That did it.

40:57.163 --> 40:59.791
Run for it!

41:20.186 --> 41:22.439
Huh? Yikes!

41:25.358 --> 41:27.360
Foolish mortals.

41:27.902 --> 41:34.410
Return the sword to me
and I shall destroy you quickly.

41:34.617 --> 41:37.336
Return the sword
and be destroyed?

41:38.788 --> 41:41.462
Like, I'd hate to hear
option number two.

42:36.512 --> 42:37.934
- Hey!
- Oof!

42:38.765 --> 42:39.937
My glasses.

42:40.141 --> 42:43.111
Oh, I can't see a thing
without my glasses.

42:44.562 --> 42:47.816
That's funny, I can't see a
thing with your glasses.

42:53.696 --> 42:55.164
Zoinks!

42:59.869 --> 43:01.542
Run!

43:08.461 --> 43:09.929
Huh?

43:13.508 --> 43:14.930
ALL So

43:20.640 --> 43:22.642
It's all very simple.

43:22.850 --> 43:26.445
Sojo has been behind these
samurai shenanigans all along.

43:26.646 --> 43:29.525
He stole the Black Samurai's armor
from the museum.

43:29.732 --> 43:34.283
And he used this high-tech mini jetpack
to fly around like a real live ghost.

43:34.487 --> 43:36.615
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

43:38.825 --> 43:41.999
Sojo's master plan was to bring the
legend of the Black Samurai to life...

43:42.203 --> 43:44.706
...and scare everyone away
from the tournament.

43:46.040 --> 43:48.168
<i>That way he could steal
the Destiny Scroll...</i>

43:48.376 --> 43:51.846
<i>...then search for the
Sword of Doom on his own.</i>

43:54.424 --> 43:56.222
Once we set out
to solve the mystery...

43:56.426 --> 43:59.521
...his only hope was to steal
the sword from us.

43:59.720 --> 44:02.314
Like, talk about a
sneaky samurai.

44:02.515 --> 44:05.689
Yeah, sneaky.

44:05.893 --> 44:06.940
Yes.

44:07.145 --> 44:09.193
And he would have gotten away
with it too...

44:09.397 --> 44:11.820
...if it weren't for
you meddling kids.

44:12.024 --> 44:13.276
Sojo!

44:21.743 --> 44:23.336
Zoinks!
Yikes!

44:23.536 --> 44:26.460
Jeepers!
Jinkies!

44:27.373 --> 44:30.627
Dang, I still don't
have a catch phrase.

44:30.835 --> 44:32.428
We must protect the sword.

44:36.674 --> 44:38.551
Huh! They're robots.

44:38.760 --> 44:40.103
Ninja robots!

44:40.303 --> 44:41.555
Double cool!

44:41.763 --> 44:44.312
Uh, sorry, I--
I geeked out there for a sec.

44:44.515 --> 44:47.234
So, like, the ninjas
were your own robots?

44:47.435 --> 44:49.904
Huh? I don't get it.

44:52.190 --> 44:54.409
The tournament was
just an excuse...

44:54.609 --> 44:59.206
...to gather the greatest martial
artists from around the world.

45:05.369 --> 45:06.916
<i>Using computer analysis...</i>

45:07.121 --> 45:11.092
<i>...their various fighting styles
were digitized...</i>

45:11.292 --> 45:13.841
<i>...into my ninja robots.</i>

45:15.171 --> 45:18.220
After that, all I needed
was to find someone...

45:18.424 --> 45:21.428
...who could solve
the riddle of the Destiny Scroll.

45:21.636 --> 45:25.686
And who better than the world's
greatest teenage detectives?

45:25.890 --> 45:27.062
Come on, Miyumi.

45:27.266 --> 45:29.610
We can fight them together.

45:30.353 --> 45:31.775
Miyumi?

45:31.979 --> 45:34.949
Huh! You're one of them.

45:35.149 --> 45:39.245
I'm sorry, but I must remain
loyal to my sensei.

45:39.445 --> 45:41.664
Tomorrow night,
when the moon is full...

45:41.864 --> 45:45.744
...I will resurrect the Black
Samurai from the Sword of Doom.

45:45.952 --> 45:51.129
Once I have freed his spirit,
he will call me master.

45:51.791 --> 45:52.838
No.

45:53.042 --> 45:54.510
This is madness.

45:54.710 --> 45:56.758
Once the Black Samurai
has returned...

45:56.963 --> 45:59.557
...I will order him
to lead my robot ninjas...

45:59.757 --> 46:03.057
...against the ignorant forces
of this modern age.

46:03.261 --> 46:05.684
Then the ancient world
of the samurai...

46:05.888 --> 46:07.982
...and the new world
of technology...

46:08.182 --> 46:12.528
...shall exist in
perfect harmony.

46:12.728 --> 46:15.607
Oh.
Hmm, it could work.

46:15.815 --> 46:19.115
Miyumi, did you know about this?
No.

46:19.318 --> 46:21.662
My only instructions
were to earn your trust...

46:21.863 --> 46:24.036
...by becoming your friend.

46:24.240 --> 46:26.993
The first rule of
Mirimoto Academy.

46:27.201 --> 46:28.828
If you want to win...

46:29.036 --> 46:34.088
...you must be willing to do that
which others are not willing to do.

46:34.292 --> 46:36.886
But if you do things
that a winner wouldn't do...

46:37.086 --> 46:39.555
...that automatically
makes you a loser.

46:39.756 --> 46:41.349
Hyah!

46:42.216 --> 46:43.684
Huh?

46:44.010 --> 46:45.887
Zoinks!
Uh-oh!

46:46.262 --> 46:47.605
Whoa!

46:54.562 --> 46:57.941
Like, all aboard
the Samurai Sword Express.

46:58.149 --> 47:00.277
Shaggy and Scooby
got away.

47:00.484 --> 47:04.580
But you will not be
so fortunate.

47:06.157 --> 47:08.455
Miyumi, Sojo, come.

47:08.659 --> 47:11.208
I hope you will enjoy
your new role...

47:11.412 --> 47:16.259
...as part of the museum's
permanent collection.

47:58.793 --> 48:00.170
Shaggy?

48:17.395 --> 48:18.863
Zoinks!

48:23.067 --> 48:25.661
Way to go, Scoob.
I think we lost them.

48:25.861 --> 48:27.534
Huh?

48:27.738 --> 48:31.538
Gulp! Speaking of losing,
like, we're losing altitude.

48:35.162 --> 48:37.085
- Ungh!
- Phew.

48:38.624 --> 48:40.092
Huh?

48:55.516 --> 48:59.146
Welcome to Green Dragon Sushi.
You sit.

48:59.353 --> 49:02.152
Eat sushi. Good for you, eh?

49:02.356 --> 49:05.451
Like, you got anything back there
without a head on it?

49:08.112 --> 49:10.331
Ew.

49:10.531 --> 49:13.330
You like miso soup?

49:13.534 --> 49:16.413
Misc soup?
Sounds perfect- Ha, ha.

49:16.620 --> 49:18.418
Like, me so hungry.

49:18.623 --> 49:22.218
Yeah. Me so hungry too.

49:26.297 --> 49:29.517
Ah! Like, that
really hit the spot.

49:29.717 --> 49:31.560
Yum, yum.

49:33.596 --> 49:37.021
I am Matsuhiro.

49:37.224 --> 49:38.567
Menu?

49:39.310 --> 49:40.937
Hey, check it out, Scoob.

49:41.145 --> 49:44.740
Like, it's our old friend,
the Green Dragon.

49:44.941 --> 49:48.787
Ah! So you know the legend.

49:49.779 --> 49:51.326
You could say that.

49:51.530 --> 49:53.703
Do you know what I like most
about legends?

49:53.908 --> 49:57.412
New chapters are being written
all the time.

49:58.871 --> 50:00.873
You never know
what is going to happen next.

50:06.587 --> 50:07.839
- Zoinks!
- Yipes!

50:08.047 --> 50:12.177
Gulp! Like, Sword of Doom,
don't fail us now.

50:12.384 --> 50:15.479
Eh? The Sword of Doom?

50:15.679 --> 50:17.226
But how?

50:17.431 --> 50:18.728
Like, we'll tell you later.

50:18.933 --> 50:22.904
Right now, we've got a serious case
of the robot ninjas.

50:23.103 --> 50:24.946
Robot ninjas?

50:28.609 --> 50:30.452
Hyah!

50:30.653 --> 50:33.247
Now we will have some fun.

50:47.962 --> 50:51.512
No! The Sword of Doom.

50:56.762 --> 50:58.435
They are gone.

50:58.639 --> 51:00.937
Gee whiz, for a sushi chef...

51:01.141 --> 51:04.111
...you're no cold fish
with a samurai sword.

51:04.311 --> 51:09.693
That is because I am samurai.

51:17.116 --> 51:20.996
Give it up, Freddy.
Those doors must be 3 feet thick.

51:22.830 --> 51:24.423
We gotta get out of here somehow.

51:24.623 --> 51:27.376
I'll chop away all
night if I have to.

51:29.253 --> 51:31.847
We do not have all night.

51:33.465 --> 51:37.140
I should not have been so critical
of this modern age.

51:37.762 --> 51:40.311
If only I had one more chance...

51:40.514 --> 51:46.442
...I would fight to save this
world like a modern-day samurai.

51:47.897 --> 51:48.944
Huh?

52:00.493 --> 52:03.997
You've freed us, Kenji.
You're a hero.

52:05.998 --> 52:07.671
Takagawa san?

52:07.875 --> 52:10.128
Why did you lock yourself
in the vault?

52:10.336 --> 52:12.088
There is no time to explain.

52:13.547 --> 52:18.804
There will be more than one
samurai brought back to life.

52:22.515 --> 52:26.520
How could we let those rotten
robots take the Sword of Doom?

52:26.727 --> 52:28.195
What are we gonna do now?

52:29.647 --> 52:30.694
I don't know.

52:30.898 --> 52:32.866
Look there.

52:33.067 --> 52:36.116
The great mountain,
Fuji san.

52:36.320 --> 52:42.123
Sacred training ground
for generations of samurai.

52:42.326 --> 52:43.578
Samurai?

52:43.786 --> 52:47.165
But, like, we don't know anything
about being samurai warriors.

52:47.373 --> 52:48.670
Mm-mm.

52:50.376 --> 52:51.798
Do not be afraid.

52:52.002 --> 52:55.256
A samurai must overcome his fear.

52:55.464 --> 52:56.966
When fear is gone...

52:57.174 --> 52:59.723
...the mind will be empty.

53:01.178 --> 53:03.055
Ha, ha. Like, an empty mind?

53:03.263 --> 53:05.641
Well, why didn't you just say so?
Ha-ha-ha.

53:05.849 --> 53:07.977
Now, that's something
I've got already.

53:08.185 --> 53:10.153
Uh-huh. Me too.

53:11.021 --> 53:12.773
The samurai never hesitates.

53:12.981 --> 53:15.609
He acts, he fights, he wins.

53:15.818 --> 53:19.368
Without fear, without anger,
without mind.

53:19.571 --> 53:21.494
And without lunch breaks.

53:21.699 --> 53:25.454
Like, I'm ready to trade in this
samurai sword for a shish kebab.

53:25.661 --> 53:28.665
Oh, shish kebab.

53:28.872 --> 53:30.966
Yum, yum.

53:37.006 --> 53:39.600
That's it, Scoob. We did it.

53:43.012 --> 53:44.639
Well done, tomodachi.

53:44.847 --> 53:46.690
You are ready to begin.

53:46.890 --> 53:49.109
Gulp! Begin?

53:49.310 --> 53:51.278
The last chapter has ended.

53:51.479 --> 53:55.074
The next is yet to be written.

53:58.986 --> 54:01.455
These are the four gates:

54:01.989 --> 54:04.162
Earth, Air...

54:04.366 --> 54:06.664
...Fire and Water.

54:06.869 --> 54:09.713
Passing through each,
you will be purified.

54:09.913 --> 54:12.917
You have already found
the Gate of Earth.

54:13.125 --> 54:14.377
Huh?

54:14.585 --> 54:18.931
All you must do now
is pass through.

54:20.508 --> 54:22.476
Ha, ha.
Like, that was easy.

54:22.676 --> 54:24.519
The journey has begun.

54:24.720 --> 54:28.395
There can be no going back now.

54:28.599 --> 54:30.818
Okay.
Like, where to next?

54:31.018 --> 54:33.271
The legend tells of two swords...

54:33.479 --> 54:37.825
...the Sword of Doom
and the Sword of Fate.

54:38.359 --> 54:43.115
Pass beyond the four gates
to the lair of the Green Dragon.

54:43.322 --> 54:46.075
Wake him from his
ancient slumber...

54:46.283 --> 54:49.287
...and seize the Sword of Fate.

54:49.495 --> 54:53.875
Gulp! Like, any chance you'd throw in a
couple of Scooby Snacks for the road?

54:55.459 --> 54:57.837
Like, Scoob, old buddy...

54:58.045 --> 55:01.515
...remind me again
how we got talked into this.

55:01.715 --> 55:05.310
I don't remember.

55:06.929 --> 55:08.772
There it is.

55:08.973 --> 55:10.691
That must be the Gate of Air.

55:12.142 --> 55:15.066
Like, last one there
is a rotten samurai.

55:19.566 --> 55:21.568
Ha, ha. We made it.

55:21.777 --> 55:23.245
Huh?

55:23.445 --> 55:24.492
Yipes!

55:24.697 --> 55:29.919
Gulp! Like, whatever you do,
Scoob, don't look down.

55:30.119 --> 55:31.587
Yikes!

55:41.714 --> 55:44.684
Phew! Like, that was a close one.

55:44.883 --> 55:45.930
SCOOBY
Huh?

55:58.480 --> 56:00.983
Like, check us out, Scoob.
We're hanging 10.

56:01.191 --> 56:04.786
Gulp! Ten thousand degrees
Fahrenheit, that is.

56:09.241 --> 56:12.211
There it is, Scoob.
The Gate of Fire.

56:21.336 --> 56:23.430
Whoa!

56:31.263 --> 56:32.936
The Gate of Water.

56:33.140 --> 56:34.187
Water.

56:41.607 --> 56:42.654
- Huh?
- Ooh!

56:43.233 --> 56:44.701
We made it, Scoob.

56:44.901 --> 56:47.996
This must be the Green Dragon's
groovy grotto.

56:48.197 --> 56:52.828
Like, not bad for a mystical dragon
who probably doesn't even exist.

56:53.035 --> 56:58.166
Who dares enter my sacred grove?

56:58.540 --> 57:02.886
Be ye samurai?

57:03.795 --> 57:06.969
You bet. Like,
I'm Shogun Shaggy...

57:07.174 --> 57:11.304
...and this is my faithful
companion, Samurai Scooby-Doo.

57:11.512 --> 57:13.230
Gulp! Hello.

57:13.430 --> 57:17.651
O Great Green One,
we come bearing rotten news.

57:17.851 --> 57:22.857
The Sword of Doom is back and the
Black Samurai is on the attack.

57:26.360 --> 57:28.658
Impossible.

57:30.572 --> 57:34.452
Ages ago, the Sword of
Doom was hidden away...

57:34.660 --> 57:40.167
...protected by guardians of stone,
high atop a secret mountain...

57:40.374 --> 57:46.427
...on a savage island surrounded
by an impenetrable fog.

57:50.592 --> 57:52.765
Yeah, funny story about that.

57:56.557 --> 58:00.528
But, like, that's all ancient history.
Tonight, the modern world is in danger...

58:00.727 --> 58:02.570
...and we need your help.

58:03.188 --> 58:06.738
There is no place left
in the world for dragons.

58:09.861 --> 58:10.908
What are you?

58:11.113 --> 58:15.619
A big green dragon
afraid of a little sword fight?

58:20.205 --> 58:24.051
You don't look like samurai.

58:28.297 --> 58:30.220
Tell him, Shaggy.
Gulp!

58:30.424 --> 58:31.801
Like, the truth is--

58:39.933 --> 58:42.527
That's better.

58:42.936 --> 58:44.062
Like, wow. Ha, ha.

58:44.271 --> 58:48.447
Check it out, Scoob. We're rolling
old-school, samurai-style.

58:48.650 --> 58:51.278
Yeah, old-school.

58:53.029 --> 58:56.624
For centuries, I have guarded
the Sword of Fate...

58:56.825 --> 59:00.250
...awaiting the day when its
service would again be needed.

59:00.454 --> 59:03.879
That day has finally come.

59:09.254 --> 59:14.351
The legend must end
where it all began.

59:14.551 --> 59:17.896
Like, up, up and away we go.

59:18.096 --> 59:20.190
Whee!

59:30.984 --> 59:32.327
Sojo, come.

59:32.527 --> 59:34.029
It is time.

59:44.873 --> 59:49.879
The Destiny Scroll
still holds one last secret.

59:52.672 --> 59:54.766
"Standing on the bridge
of his defeat...

59:54.967 --> 59:58.267
...hold the Sword of Doom
to the rising full moon.

59:58.470 --> 01:00:00.598
The spell will be broken...

01:00:00.806 --> 01:00:03.309
...and the spirit of
the Black Samurai...

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:06.896
...shall be set free."

01:00:07.479 --> 01:00:10.904
Sojo, walk to the bridge.

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:14.328
Sojo walk to bridge.

01:00:17.489 --> 01:00:20.538
Miyumi, do not fail
me this night.

01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:24.963
Your loyalty shall be rewarded
in the coming new world.

01:00:25.164 --> 01:00:27.462
Yes, sensei.

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:35.344
Okay, gang, get ready.

01:00:35.882 --> 01:00:38.852
I can't believe Miyumi's
really going through with this.

01:00:39.052 --> 01:00:42.773
Ohh! With friends like her,
who needs enemies?

01:00:46.518 --> 01:00:49.613
Miyumi, sword.

01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:51.656
Huh? Huh?

01:00:55.319 --> 01:00:57.868
The treacherous little fool.
Ugh!

01:00:58.071 --> 01:01:00.745
Yahoo! Way to go, Miyumi.

01:01:00.949 --> 01:01:02.792
I knew you were one of us.

01:01:05.412 --> 01:01:07.961
Oops!
Now, Velma.

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:09.670
Hit it, Kenji.

01:01:19.384 --> 01:01:21.182
Magnetic pulse away.

01:01:28.226 --> 01:01:32.151
The magnetic pulse is knocking
out their electrical systems.

01:01:34.399 --> 01:01:36.117
It Worked.

01:01:56.254 --> 01:01:59.679
Hmm. Maybe it worked
a little too well.

01:02:03.637 --> 01:02:05.184
Ungrateful child.

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:10.520
I was blinded by my loyalty to you,
but now I can see clearly.

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:13.901
How dare you disobey me?

01:02:22.489 --> 01:02:23.911
Huh! The sword!

01:02:27.369 --> 01:02:29.246
<i>Bansai!</i>

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:03.948
The Black Samurai lives again.

01:03:07.868 --> 01:03:09.120
No, samurai.

01:03:09.327 --> 01:03:11.079
I am the master here.

01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:13.165
Bow before me...

01:03:13.373 --> 01:03:16.343
...and I will give you the world.

01:03:19.588 --> 01:03:21.716
Foolish one.

01:03:25.677 --> 01:03:30.433
It is you who shall
call me master.

01:03:33.518 --> 01:03:34.770
MOANS]

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:39.154
Bow before me, mortals.

01:03:40.859 --> 01:03:42.953
- Unh!
- Unh! Whoa!

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:47.578
- Unh!
- Unh! Whoa!

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:54.873
All shall serve me...

01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:57.834
...forever!

01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:04.090
Shaggy, look.

01:04:09.554 --> 01:04:14.560
At last, freedom is mine.

01:04:14.768 --> 01:04:16.987
Oh, no. Like, we're too late.

01:04:17.187 --> 01:04:18.234
Fear not.

01:04:18.438 --> 01:04:21.567
Shogun Shaggy, Samurai Scooby...

01:04:21.775 --> 01:04:24.324
...you must carry on the fight.

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:26.871
Unsheathe the Sword of Fate...

01:04:27.072 --> 01:04:30.952
...so that my spirit
may enter the blade.

01:04:31.159 --> 01:04:33.912
I shall be with you always...

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:39.172
...guiding the sword from within.

01:04:50.136 --> 01:04:51.604
Guys, look.

01:04:51.805 --> 01:04:53.648
Huh! It's Shaggy and Scooby.

01:04:53.848 --> 01:04:55.350
Ow! My neck.

01:04:56.768 --> 01:04:59.863
Like, right on time,
late as usual.

01:05:11.199 --> 01:05:15.955
Who dares challenge
the Black Samurai?

01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:18.290
Zoinks!
Like, here we go, Scoob.

01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:21.217
Remember what they taught us
in samurai school.

01:05:21.418 --> 01:05:24.297
Uh... Uh, I forgot.

01:05:33.346 --> 01:05:35.098
Huh?

01:05:35.849 --> 01:05:38.602
The Sword of Fate?

01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:40.979
Impossible.

01:05:41.187 --> 01:05:42.939
Like, you think
that's impossible...

01:05:43.148 --> 01:05:46.618
...try flying into Tokyo
on a green dragon sometime.

01:06:33.448 --> 01:06:34.825
Hyah!

01:06:48.296 --> 01:06:51.095
Fools. You are no match for me.

01:06:53.802 --> 01:06:55.554
- Aah!
- Yipes!

01:06:58.681 --> 01:07:02.106
A samurai must overcome his fear.

01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:07.692
When fear is gone,
the mind will be empty.

01:07:07.899 --> 01:07:09.776
Like, did you hear that, Scoob?

01:07:09.984 --> 01:07:12.237
Yeah, I did.

01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:14.914
It's that sushi sword master,
Matsuhiro.

01:07:15.114 --> 01:07:16.286
He's in my head.

01:07:16.491 --> 01:07:18.585
No, I'm not. I'm over here.

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:21.914
The samurai acts without anger.

01:07:22.121 --> 01:07:24.795
He fights without mind.

01:07:29.671 --> 01:07:30.718
Yikes!

01:07:30.922 --> 01:07:32.890
Don't think, Scoob.
Just let it go.

01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:35.093
Like, no mind.

01:07:35.301 --> 01:07:37.429
Oh, yeah.

01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:44.312
The Sword of Doom
shall be your destroyer.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:55.867
Hyah!

01:07:59.659 --> 01:08:03.914
No!

01:08:17.385 --> 01:08:21.060
Ha, ha. Like, that psychotic
samurai forgot one thing.

01:08:21.264 --> 01:08:24.518
When it comes to no mind,
we've got everybody beat.

01:08:24.725 --> 01:08:26.649
Like, our minds are
always empty.

01:08:26.853 --> 01:08:28.479
Yeah.

01:08:30.314 --> 01:08:33.740
Scooby, Shaggy,
that was amazing.

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:39.038
Huh?

01:08:45.662 --> 01:08:48.462
Like, it's just a little old man.

01:08:48.666 --> 01:08:50.009
Thank you...

01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:53.805
...most honored friends.

01:08:54.005 --> 01:08:56.053
You have released my spirit...

01:08:56.256 --> 01:09:00.636
...from the evil power
of that cursed sword...

01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:03.689
...and saved your world.

01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:08.817
I shall be eternally grateful.

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:12.819
You are indeed samurai...

01:09:13.024 --> 01:09:16.528
...and your legend
shall be told...

01:09:17.236 --> 01:09:19.955
...forever.

01:09:23.368 --> 01:09:24.415
Wow.

01:09:24.618 --> 01:09:25.996
He disappeared.

01:09:26.203 --> 01:09:28.002
Well, you gotta hand it to him.

01:09:28.206 --> 01:09:31.005
He went out in real
samurai-style.

01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:34.636
Congratulations...

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:37.807
...samurai.

01:09:38.549 --> 01:09:42.975
The last chapter of the legend
has finally been written...

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:45.853
"by you.

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:49.439
<i>Welcome to...</i>

01:09:49.644 --> 01:09:51.738
<i>...the new Tokyo Museum
of Cultural History...</i>

01:09:51.938 --> 01:09:55.659
<i>...and the grand opening
of our most legendary exhibit...</i>

01:09:55.859 --> 01:10:00.205
<i>...the ghost of the
Black Samurai.</i>

01:10:00.822 --> 01:10:04.201
And so, it is with
great honor that I present...

01:10:04.409 --> 01:10:09.836
...for loyal service to his friends,
to Japan and to all the world...

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:12.508
...this statue...

01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:16.846
...in honor of Scooby-Doo.

01:10:21.968 --> 01:10:25.017
Droo-ga-ga. Droo-ga-ga.

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:31.607
Scoob, you really did get
your own statue.

01:10:31.811 --> 01:10:34.439
Ha, ha. And, like,
they even got your good side.

01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:35.864
Yeah.

01:10:37.317 --> 01:10:40.116
Ha, ha. Congratulations, Scooby.

01:10:40.904 --> 01:10:44.704
Now Japan will
remember you forever.

01:10:44.908 --> 01:10:47.377
Are you sure you won't come
with us, Miyumi?

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:50.126
There's bound to be other
mysteries that need solving.

01:10:50.329 --> 01:10:52.957
And there's always room for one
more in the Mystery Machine.

01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:55.840
Yeah, like, you could sit
in the back with me and Scooby.

01:10:56.044 --> 01:10:58.092
Yeah, sit with me.

01:10:58.588 --> 01:11:00.215
You're all very sweet...

01:11:00.423 --> 01:11:02.551
...but solving mysteries
is what you do best.

01:11:02.759 --> 01:11:05.888
Now I need to figure out
what it is that I do best.

01:11:06.096 --> 01:11:07.313
Then maybe someday...

01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:10.187
...I will have what it takes
to become a legend too.

01:11:10.391 --> 01:11:12.189
Just like you, Scooby.

01:11:14.187 --> 01:11:15.734
Aw...

01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:25.577
Heh, heh. Oh, brother.

01:11:25.782 --> 01:11:26.954
This could take a while.

01:11:28.409 --> 01:11:31.663
We may just have to leave Scooby
here and take the statue home.

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:41.511
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
