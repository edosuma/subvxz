00:02.200 --> 00:03.645
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

00:03.880 --> 00:05.120
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

00:05.400 --> 00:08.802
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

00:09.040 --> 00:10.963
<i>But my old approach wasn't enough.</i>

00:11.240 --> 00:12.480
<i>I had to become someone else.</i>

00:12.720 --> 00:15.041
<i>I had to become something else.</i>

00:15.760 --> 00:18.445
<i>I had to become the Green Arrow.</i>

00:18.600 --> 00:19.965
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

00:20.240 --> 00:21.446
You won't be able to stop him.

00:21.600 --> 00:22.965
<i>We need to trap him.</i>

00:27.400 --> 00:28.322
Dad?

00:28.560 --> 00:30.085
<i>"NOAH". We are the same, you and I.</i>

00:30.280 --> 00:32.408
You were wrong. lam nothing like you.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.609
<i>"JOHN". I had to put him down, Lyla.</i>

00:35.840 --> 00:37.649
He had reached for my gun.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.164
- Alex. Where are we?
- Thea...

00:40.400 --> 00:41.925
- No, I can't...
- Where are you going?

00:44.240 --> 00:47.130
Rubicon. Designed to prevent any country,
even our own,

00:47.320 --> 00:48.481
from firing a nuclear missile.

00:48.680 --> 00:49.647
<i>"LYLA". Darhk ripped it out.</i>

00:49.840 --> 00:51.922
<i>Darhk would control
the world's nuclear stockpile.</i>

00:52.120 --> 00:53.849
Andy told me that "Genesis" was coming.

00:54.080 --> 00:56.287
<i>God wanted to give the world
a do-over so he destroyed it.</i>

00:56.480 --> 00:57.447
<i>He destroyed it with a flood.</i>

00:57.640 --> 00:59.847
<i>So, nuclear annihilation
is Darhk's flood,</i>

01:00.120 --> 01:02.646
<i>what's he planning on building as his ark?</i>

01:52.040 --> 01:55.203
Russia, Markovia, Corto Maltese,
us, every NATO ally.

01:55.400 --> 01:58.006
Rubicon has control
over all their nuclear systems.

01:58.200 --> 01:59.531
You mean HIVE does.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.882
I know it's a little late for this,
but whoever created an algorithm

02:02.080 --> 02:06.210
that could override any country's
nuclear weapons really screwed up.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.731
That would be Amanda Waller.

02:09.680 --> 02:10.681
How much time do we have?

02:10.880 --> 02:11.927
<i>NW e“ f?</i>

02:12.160 --> 02:16.006
Oliver, I'm the director of ARGUS
and this goes way over my head.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.241
This is executive-level
and this is Department of Defense.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.448
Right. Right, right, right.
But how much time?

02:21.680 --> 02:24.126
There's a startup sequence
before Darhk can actually launch a nuke.

02:24.440 --> 02:25.601
We have just under 21 hours.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.968
Yeah, you're gonna have to find a way
to interrupt that sequence.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.043
Rubicon is a fail-safe
against nuclear Armageddon.

02:30.240 --> 02:32.368
ARGUS designed it to be 100% un-hackable.

02:32.560 --> 02:34.562
No, she can do it. She's the best.

02:34.800 --> 02:37.246
Uh, actually, that would be my father.
As far as Rubicon's concerned.

02:37.400 --> 02:40.051
It uses Fourier protocols.
Noah practically wrote the book on them.

02:41.360 --> 02:42.441
The world is facing nuclear Armageddon.

02:42.720 --> 02:44.802
My pride and my general dislike
for my father can take a backseat

02:45.040 --> 02:46.405
for the next 20-plus hours.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.762
Felicity, this isn't about pride.
Your father's a criminal.

02:48.960 --> 02:49.961
He can't be trusted.

02:50.240 --> 02:53.050
I'm not saying we should trust him,
I'm saying we need to.

02:54.280 --> 02:56.089
Okay. He got out in Darhk'sjailbreak.

02:56.320 --> 02:57.606
- How do we find him?
- I'm already running a search.

02:57.800 --> 02:58.926
Can you try
and get in touch with Thea, too?

02:59.080 --> 03:00.081
Please, we need her back here.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.442
John, can I talk to you for a second?

03:06.560 --> 03:07.800
- How you doing?
- Been better.

03:08.080 --> 03:10.481
Well, I'm not going to pretend
to understand what you're going through...

03:10.720 --> 03:12.245
Well, Oliver, you've been through this
with your mother,

03:12.440 --> 03:13.407
which is why I can't quite understand

03:13.600 --> 03:14.567
why you're putting the fate of the world

03:14.760 --> 03:15.727
in the hands of another evil parent.

03:15.960 --> 03:18.008
I'm not trusting Kuttler.
I trust Felicity,

03:18.240 --> 03:20.925
and we should just let her do herjob.
Okay?

03:21.240 --> 03:22.480
We have one of our own.

03:22.760 --> 03:23.682
Yeah. Stopping Darhk.

03:23.920 --> 03:27.606
His magic is powered by death.
So, if even one of those nukes hits...

03:27.800 --> 03:30.121
He'll be unstoppable.
Okay, what's your plan?

03:30.280 --> 03:32.601
Well, if he is planning
on harnessing all of this death,

03:32.800 --> 03:35.371
he's gonna be at
something called a nexus chamber.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.170
Basically, it's a collector of magic.

03:37.440 --> 03:39.920
And here I thought earthquake machines
were as strange as it got.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.647
Esrin Fortuna told me that
one of these chambers exists in Star City.

03:43.800 --> 03:46.007
I'm betting it falls on a ley line.

03:46.280 --> 03:47.202
What'd Vixen call them?

03:47.440 --> 03:48.805
- "Wi-Fi for magic"?
- Yeah.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.803
It's a big city, Oliver,
we've got 21 hours.

03:51.280 --> 03:53.009
One step at a time.

03:55.640 --> 03:56.607
We have to help them.

03:56.840 --> 03:58.365
We're gonna help these people.

04:01.480 --> 04:02.481
What are you looking for?

04:02.640 --> 04:04.051
Well, Reiter and his men
found a way on the island.

04:04.280 --> 04:05.645
There has to be a way off.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.365
There's a plane.
East end of the island. It's far.

04:09.640 --> 04:10.971
We'll make it.

04:12.480 --> 04:14.847
- What's that?
- This may be a way to call for help.

04:15.040 --> 04:16.041
Let's go.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.201
Woof.

04:31.160 --> 04:32.241
I know.

04:32.480 --> 04:35.324
The predictability
was a terrible flaw in the design.

04:35.520 --> 04:38.205
Predictability is your flaw, too.

04:38.360 --> 04:41.045
Every time my life starts to suck,
you show up.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.491
Leave us.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.487
Is that hand a present
from your new best friend?

04:51.840 --> 04:54.207
I'm not doing this for a prosthetic, Thea.

04:55.360 --> 04:58.250
- I'm doing it to keep you safe.
- Keep me safe.

04:58.520 --> 04:59.442
- Yes. Keep you safe.
- Yeah.

04:59.680 --> 05:01.682
Like I said, predictable.

05:02.840 --> 05:04.285
Only thing I don't get is,

05:04.520 --> 05:07.364
how is brainwashing
some guy I really like

05:07.560 --> 05:09.449
in your plan to keep me safe?

05:09.680 --> 05:10.681
His conditioning wasn't my idea.

05:10.880 --> 05:13.929
Ruvé Darhk wanted to assure
his compliance in the final phase.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.611
Final phase of what?

05:16.400 --> 05:17.845
Something called Genesis.

05:18.960 --> 05:22.248
Darhk plans to burn the world
in a nuclear fire

05:22.400 --> 05:24.209
while we are protected down here.

05:25.560 --> 05:28.245
Then he and his followers
can rebuild.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.768
Truth be told,
it's not dissimilar to the plan

05:31.920 --> 05:33.922
I had for the Glades, once upon a time.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.969
But on a much, much larger scale.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.440
Let me guess.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.888
You don't think that destroying
the entire world is completely insane.

05:41.080 --> 05:45.130
The world is what's insane.
It is beyond saving.

05:45.920 --> 05:48.730
It needs a do-over. A reset.

05:49.560 --> 05:52.404
Look, once I realized
Darhk's plan was inevitable,

05:52.600 --> 05:53.567
the math was simple...

05:53.760 --> 05:55.000
Save yourself.

05:55.240 --> 05:56.401
And my daughter.

05:58.080 --> 05:59.730
Even if she doesn't want to be saved.

06:00.440 --> 06:04.445
Look, I am way, way past the point
of telling you

06:04.600 --> 06:06.602
that you are crazy.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.804
I just want to see Alex,

06:11.240 --> 06:12.446
just want to know he's okay.

06:12.960 --> 06:17.648
And, look, I get it, I'm stuck here.

06:18.320 --> 06:20.800
But I can be stuck here and compliant

06:21.680 --> 06:24.081
or I can be a pain in your ass.

06:24.920 --> 06:26.490
So take me to him.

06:27.160 --> 06:28.207
Now.

06:41.480 --> 06:42.641
Hey-

06:45.000 --> 06:46.809
- Hey, hon.
- Hi.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.005
What's up?

06:49.600 --> 06:50.601
Um...

06:52.280 --> 06:54.362
When I was at your place
this morning, I...

06:57.280 --> 06:58.566
I found this.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.485
What are you doing going through my stuff?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.525
Snooping.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.246
But this isn't any of your business,
Donna.

07:08.480 --> 07:10.482
No, no, babe. it is my business, actually.

07:10.680 --> 07:11.841
You getting suspended.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.690
- It is, kind of.
- But, Donna...

07:13.840 --> 07:16.491
Hey. What is this?

07:18.520 --> 07:20.204
It's... It's...

07:21.000 --> 07:22.411
It's an affidavit.

07:22.640 --> 07:26.486
Pike said if I put my name to it,
then I can get my badge back.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.367
It says you didn't know
that Laurel was the Black Canary.

07:32.040 --> 07:35.362
I may not be in Mansa,
but I know how to read, sweetie.

07:36.680 --> 07:37.920
I think it's "Mensa," actually.

07:38.160 --> 07:41.926
You told me
that you knew what Laurel was doing.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.723
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so?

07:45.520 --> 07:46.521
This is a lie.

07:48.680 --> 07:50.011
Yeah, but it's a complicated lie.

07:50.240 --> 07:51.571
- Is it?
- Yeah.

07:52.520 --> 07:53.681
Yeah.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.446
'Cause, according to Pike,
lAB are willing to look the other way

07:57.680 --> 07:59.409
about my working with Darhk,

08:02.360 --> 08:03.566
'cause I was protecting Laurel.

08:03.840 --> 08:06.081
Why would you have to protect her
if she was a superhero?

08:06.240 --> 08:07.890
Yeah, exactly. Now you see?

08:08.880 --> 08:12.805
I see that they're asking you to lie.

08:13.040 --> 08:14.929
Sweetheart. Come on.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.521
All I ever wanted was to be a cop.

08:17.760 --> 08:20.081
Now, what's a small lie if it means
I can do some good for this city?

08:20.240 --> 08:21.605
No.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.922
No, that's just it.
There aren't any small lies, hon.

08:25.880 --> 08:30.488
Take it from someone who had a child
with a man who was a liar.

08:30.720 --> 08:31.926
I'm not Noah Kuttler.

08:32.799 --> 08:35.167
I know, honey, and that's why I love you.

08:36.720 --> 08:37.721
Okay?

08:40.080 --> 08:41.410
I love you,

08:43.080 --> 08:44.809
and that's why I have faith that

08:47.080 --> 08:48.491
you're gonna do the right thing.

09:01.680 --> 09:04.650
Gentlemen.
I've a little errand I need you to run.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.770
A loose end
that needs tying up, not unlike...

09:08.840 --> 09:10.126
Huh.

09:10.640 --> 09:12.483
Do I detect some obstinacy, Mr. Brick?

09:12.640 --> 09:15.803
I'm just used to giving the orders, Darhk.
Not taking them.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.207
Not even as a little thank-you
for busting you out of Iron Heights?

09:18.440 --> 09:19.851
Whatever happened to gratitude?

09:20.160 --> 09:21.321
I'm here, ain't I?

09:22.600 --> 09:25.649
And when the whole world is sitting
under a field of mushroom clouds,

09:25.800 --> 09:27.450
you'll be glad that you are.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.201
Now then, back to the errand.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.489
Have either of you boys
heard of The Calculator?

09:43.880 --> 09:44.881
There's no one here.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.487
Found a deep-trunk fiber-optic hook-up
with polymorphic encryption.

09:47.680 --> 09:48.841
Noah is there, trust me.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.002
She's right. Look.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.529
Whoever rigged that up
didn't want to be surprised.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.126
I'm tracing the Bluetooth signal.
Head southwest.

09:58.960 --> 09:59.882
Nope. He's not here.

10:00.160 --> 10:01.650
- He has to be.
- He was.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.524
Looks like he bolted,
and in a hurry.

10:03.720 --> 10:05.210
<i>Bolted from whom?</i>

10:16.520 --> 10:17.885
This was 20 minutes ago.

10:25.160 --> 10:27.561
Looks like Kuttlerwasn't
the only one that left Iron Heights.

10:29.920 --> 10:33.049
Those are Ghosts with him.
What does HIVE want with my father?

10:33.240 --> 10:34.605
<i>Okay-</i>

10:34.840 --> 10:36.888
<i>Find the scrawny son of a bitch.</i>

10:37.080 --> 10:39.765
<i>When you do, kill him.</i>

10:42.840 --> 10:46.731
<i>Welcome to Tevat Noah,
your home in the new era.</i>

10:46.880 --> 10:48.882
<i>Please proceed
to the registration building</i>

10:49.080 --> 10:51.526
<i>to receive your residence assignments.</i>

10:57.920 --> 10:59.445
Sorry about that.

10:59.720 --> 11:02.371
Wasn't easy finding my way down here.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.367
You Ghosts are swell at keeping secrets,

11:05.600 --> 11:07.602
but less swell at resisting torture.

11:07.760 --> 11:10.127
So why don't you spare me the trouble

11:10.360 --> 11:13.443
and tell me where I can find Damien Darhk?

11:26.720 --> 11:27.642
You were right.

11:27.880 --> 11:29.450
Kuttler's the only one
that can stop Rubicon.

11:29.600 --> 11:32.444
That's why Darhk wanted him dead.
You all right?

11:33.320 --> 11:34.651
Yeah. The word "conflicted" comes to mind.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.160
Well, at least we know he got away.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.129
With not much of a head start.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.169
I hacked Kuttler's server
to see if there was anything in there

11:40.400 --> 11:41.606
that could point us
to where he would run to,

11:41.800 --> 11:43.404
and he cleared the cache
so I can't recover any files.

11:43.640 --> 11:45.404
But there is a root directory
called Ravenspur.

11:45.640 --> 11:47.005
- What's Ravenspur?
- Don't know.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.083
Does sound familiar.
I just don't know why.

11:49.640 --> 11:51.130
We're running out of time.

11:51.480 --> 11:53.164
The whole world is, so yeah.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.890
Meantime,
my ley line algorithm kicked back

11:56.040 --> 11:57.804
a possible 20
on a magical clubhouse for Darhk.

12:03.320 --> 12:04.446
We drove some of them off,

12:05.480 --> 12:06.845
but Reiter's sending reinforcements.

12:07.120 --> 12:09.202
- Reiter's dead.
- We heard him on the radio.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.281
He's alive.

12:14.440 --> 12:15.771
Map of the island in the pack.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.684
- Get them to the plane.
- What about you?

12:18.160 --> 12:20.845
I'm gonna find Reiter,
and I'm gonna end this.

12:21.320 --> 12:22.446
Then I am staying, too.

12:22.840 --> 12:24.683
Do you remember what you told me?

12:24.880 --> 12:27.451
It takes a monster to kill a monster.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.330
Now, get these people home.

12:39.360 --> 12:40.885
Felicity just called.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.406
She needs to see me about something.

12:42.640 --> 12:43.880
Everything all right?

12:44.120 --> 12:45.690
I don't know. It's Felicity, so...

12:45.840 --> 12:47.365
You know, you never know.

12:48.240 --> 12:49.526
Are you signing that thing?

12:49.800 --> 12:51.325
Yeah, I was about to.

12:53.880 --> 12:56.565
Hey, before you give me that dirty look,

12:56.800 --> 12:58.882
you might want to read this thing.

12:59.360 --> 13:02.204
- I already read it.
- Just read it, please.

13:04.520 --> 13:05.521
Oh!

13:07.680 --> 13:10.206
- It looks...
- Yeah, it's a little different now.

13:10.560 --> 13:11.686
"Although I was against it at first,"

13:11.880 --> 13:14.690
"I came to see
what Laurel was doing was vital"

13:17.520 --> 13:19.602
"and important and good"

13:21.360 --> 13:23.169
"as the Black Canary."

13:25.080 --> 13:26.730
I gave it a little rewrite.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.001
(Bab)',

13:30.560 --> 13:33.370
lam so proud of you.

13:34.920 --> 13:36.524
Laurel would be, too.

13:37.240 --> 13:39.129
This is me signing my badge away.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.407
No.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.247
You don't know that.

13:43.520 --> 13:45.124
All you can know for sure

13:46.800 --> 13:48.882
is that you're doing the right thing.

13:53.360 --> 13:54.725
Oh! Mr. Dennis.

13:55.640 --> 13:57.130
Ms. Smoak.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.887
You haven't returned my calls.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.645
Yes. I am sorry. I've been busy.

14:03.880 --> 14:04.927
So have I.

14:05.880 --> 14:07.484
Running your company.

14:07.720 --> 14:10.883
Do I need to remind you
of your responsibilities to Palmer Tech?

14:11.120 --> 14:12.724
No, you don't.
But you're just gonna have to believe me

14:12.920 --> 14:16.481
when I tell you that what is on my plate
right now is much more important.

14:16.720 --> 14:18.404
- Hey!
- Hi. Um...

14:19.120 --> 14:20.929
- Should I come back, or...
- No, no, no. Please stay.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.562
- Ms. Smoak, the board...
- Can wait.

14:31.760 --> 14:35.287
Whatever's so important,
I hope it's worth it.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.161
Hi. I like your tie, it's very...

14:40.440 --> 14:41.441
Good.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.766
- Hi!
- Thank you for meeting me.

14:45.160 --> 14:47.162
Of course, my baby girl.

14:47.440 --> 14:48.680
My God.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.206
Are you kidding? I'm always here for you,
as long as there's no bees around.

14:52.440 --> 14:53.771
No bees.

14:55.480 --> 14:56.481
Are you okay?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.968
Does the word "Ravenspur"
mean anything to you?

15:00.760 --> 15:02.205
If this has something to do
with your father, honey...

15:02.440 --> 15:04.886
So it does? Thought I remembered
the two of you talking about it.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.122
Notjust talk. It's a...

15:07.320 --> 15:10.324
It's a cabin in Cypress Cove
we used to like to go to.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.960
We'd, you know,
we'd nurse a bottle of wine,

15:13.160 --> 15:14.127
- make love to Lionel Richie.
- Hmm.

15:14.320 --> 15:15.287
- I was his penny lover.
- Hmm.

15:15.480 --> 15:18.689
You know, your father
could go all night...

15:18.880 --> 15:19.847
Okay, that's enough. I don't...

15:20.040 --> 15:24.170
You know what? Actually, I think
you were conceived in Ravenspur.

15:24.400 --> 15:25.526
Please, make it stop. No, please.

15:25.720 --> 15:27.404
Seriously, honey.
I want to be serious for a minute.

15:27.640 --> 15:31.406
If this has anything
remotely to do with your father...

15:31.640 --> 15:34.644
Don't worry. I have it handled.

15:36.640 --> 15:40.406
I wouldn't be a Jewish mother
if I didn't worry.

15:44.640 --> 15:46.722
Baby. What's that for?

15:48.000 --> 15:50.207
With any luck,
you'll never have to find out.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.327
There's nothing here.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.045
What, did you think
he was gonna put up a sign?

15:58.200 --> 16:00.521
I was thinking more along the lines
of Ghosts with automatic weapons.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.210
Then we should've brought
our work clothes.

16:04.160 --> 16:06.208
- Can I talk to you about something?
- Yeah.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.164
I spoke to Lyla. She's worried about you.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.721
Because you said that
you shot Andy in self-defense.

16:10.920 --> 16:12.251
Oliver, I don't want to talk about this.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.562
You've just never said anything
about self-defense to me, John.

16:14.760 --> 16:15.727
Couldn't tell Lyla the truth

16:15.920 --> 16:17.410
and have her look at me
the same way anymore.

16:17.600 --> 16:18.840
Come on, you don't know that.

16:19.080 --> 16:20.047
Oliver, you're the last person on earth

16:20.240 --> 16:22.686
to lecture someone about lying
to the people they love.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.086
I'm not lecturing.

16:25.240 --> 16:26.287
I'm worried.

16:27.680 --> 16:29.409
You're better than me at this,

16:29.600 --> 16:32.809
and you're hurting worse
than I have ever seen you.

16:33.040 --> 16:36.567
Don't compound that by lying to your wife.

16:38.920 --> 16:42.242
The fact that I lied to Felicity
does not give me less credibility.

16:42.480 --> 16:45.927
If anything, it should tell you
that I know what I'm talking about.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.761
- Yeah?
- Noah's at a cabin in Cypress Cove.

16:52.960 --> 16:55.566
We got him. We're on our way.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.128
You're a hard man to find, Kuttler.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.608
Come out now, we'll make it painless.

17:08.839 --> 17:11.605
Make us work for it, we'll make it last.

17:14.480 --> 17:16.005
I hate it when they run.

17:30.480 --> 17:33.131
You make me chase you any more,
I'm going to put a bullet in you.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.924
Isn't that the plan?

17:40.160 --> 17:42.481
I'm willing to give you a sporting chance.

17:42.840 --> 17:46.208
I heard about this game
when I was in prison, Mr. Brick.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.883
You let me walk if I take you down.

17:51.120 --> 17:52.804
Darhk said
you was a smart bloke.

17:53.320 --> 17:54.845
So, what do you say?

17:55.000 --> 17:57.287
It's the end of the world,
as I understand it.

18:32.080 --> 18:34.048
Don't just stand there. Get in.

18:38.360 --> 18:40.522
- I got him.
- Spartan, fall back!

18:54.080 --> 18:55.047
Let's make this simple.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.561
This isn't a reconciliation.
This isn't a reunion.

18:57.760 --> 18:59.728
This is you helping me save the world.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.285
And what makes you think I can?

19:01.520 --> 19:03.409
Damien Darhk thinks you can.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.841
That's why he sent last year's
greatest hits to take you down.

19:06.760 --> 19:09.764
You're a smart man.
I'm assuming you know what Rubicon is.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.407
And I'm assuming
it's under Mr. Darhk's control.

19:12.680 --> 19:13.920
We have 12 hours to stop it.

19:19.280 --> 19:20.281
That's it?

19:20.960 --> 19:22.086
You seem surprised.

19:22.240 --> 19:25.084
I was expecting a quid pro quo.

19:25.280 --> 19:28.090
Felicity, I may be a terrible father...
_llMayll?

19:28.760 --> 19:29.921
But I'm not a monster.

19:30.080 --> 19:31.570
And terrible or not, I am your father.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.091
As long as you live in it,

19:33.280 --> 19:36.124
I have an interest in seeing
that this world doesn't end.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.443
That said, I do need something.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.244
Color me shocked.

19:42.280 --> 19:44.123
I can't hack Rubicon with this setup.

19:44.280 --> 19:45.964
Not in the time we have.

19:46.240 --> 19:48.447
I'm going to need
the quantum subluminal processor

19:48.600 --> 19:49.761
you developed at Palmer Tech.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.126
How did you even know that we...

19:53.480 --> 19:55.084
God help me
if you're using the end of days

19:55.280 --> 19:56.566
to steal from my company again.

19:56.960 --> 20:00.169
I'm an excellent multitasker,
but you can trust me this time.

20:08.480 --> 20:11.006
- Ms. Smoak...
- Ah, Mr. Dennis. Wow.

20:11.520 --> 20:13.329
You must be very desperate
for me to talk to the board

20:13.600 --> 20:15.125
since you brought security to dragoon me.

20:15.320 --> 20:17.368
These men are not here
to take you to the conference room.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.967
They're here
to escort you out of the building.

20:21.920 --> 20:22.842
Excuse me?

20:23.080 --> 20:25.208
The board has grave concerns
about your plans

20:25.440 --> 20:28.011
to basically give away
the bio-stimulant implant.

20:28.840 --> 20:30.842
They wanted
to discuss the matter with you.

20:31.120 --> 20:33.487
- And I will talk to them.
- It's too late for that.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.771
They voted to terminate you,
effective immediately.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.281
Wow.

20:41.680 --> 20:44.604
Okay, well, I just need to grab something
and I will show myself out. Thank you.

20:45.040 --> 20:47.691
Ah! I'm sorry,
but everything in this lab is proprietary.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.167
We cannot allow you to leave
with company property.

20:50.360 --> 20:52.169
Excuse me? You have to be kidding.

20:52.640 --> 20:53.880
I'm very sorry.

20:54.120 --> 20:57.044
I had hoped
that this would end differently.

21:04.560 --> 21:06.847
All right, folks.
Please move in right on in here.

21:07.040 --> 21:08.041
Have a great day.

21:08.320 --> 21:09.651
Alex?

21:11.320 --> 21:12.367
Hey, you.

21:12.560 --> 21:15.211
You ran off like a crazy person.
Are you feeling better?

21:16.400 --> 21:18.209
Do you know what's going on here?

21:18.400 --> 21:19.890
Yeah, Ruvé told me.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.043
- Isn't it fantastic?
- It is not fantastic.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.326
It's the end of the world.

21:24.520 --> 21:26.090
No, it's just the beginning of a new one.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.846
I got into politics
to make a difference, right?

21:29.040 --> 21:30.201
To make the world a better place,

21:30.400 --> 21:33.051
and Ruvé has shown me
that the only way to do that

21:33.240 --> 21:34.526
is to start over.

21:35.920 --> 21:36.887
Just listen to me.

21:37.080 --> 21:40.687
You are under the influence
of some type of drug right now,

21:40.880 --> 21:43.850
and we need to get out of here.

21:44.920 --> 21:46.046
You're just gonna have to trust me, okay?

21:46.280 --> 21:48.248
Hey. He can trust you later.

21:48.400 --> 21:49.401
Lonnie Machin is here.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.847
He's killed five of Damien's men
that we know about.

21:52.080 --> 21:53.411
Well, there's plenty of ways
I could respond to that,

21:53.600 --> 21:54.567
but I'm going to go with, "Good."

21:54.760 --> 21:55.761
He's hitting the CO2 scrubbers

21:56.040 --> 21:58.520
hours before nuclear weapons
will render the atmosphere above us

21:58.720 --> 21:59.926
unbreathable.

22:00.120 --> 22:03.090
If the Ark's life-support fails,
we all suffocate.

22:03.280 --> 22:04.361
Who's Lonnie Machin?

22:06.040 --> 22:08.088
He's kind of an ex-boyfriend of Thea's.

22:10.440 --> 22:13.762
Well, Damien told me
about your special connection to him.

22:14.720 --> 22:18.088
I need you to help me put him
back in the box, or we're all dead.

22:24.720 --> 22:26.927
You all right? Did you get it?

22:27.120 --> 22:29.248
I got fired.
Before I could take the processor.

22:29.440 --> 22:30.487
I can't even show my face in there.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.324
- Maybe we should call in a bomb threat.
- What?

22:32.560 --> 22:34.164
Just empty the place
or maybe plant an actual bomb.

22:34.400 --> 22:35.640
Just a small one,
one that doesn't hurt anybody.

22:35.880 --> 22:37.564
- But we have...
- All right. Maybe we should just go in.

22:37.760 --> 22:41.242
It's too risky
to wear the gear in the daylight.

22:41.440 --> 22:42.965
What about the elevator at the old lair?

22:43.240 --> 22:45.322
Uh-uh. Mr. Dennis shut it down
after the Larvan attack.

22:45.560 --> 22:46.561
So, John's right.

22:46.920 --> 22:49.161
We'll go in and help you and your father
boost it from...

22:49.400 --> 22:50.606
It's in Curtis' lab.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.610
You want me
to help my father steal from me?

22:54.920 --> 22:56.649
Well, it's not exactly yours anymore,
is it?

22:58.080 --> 23:00.242
Nope. Guess not.

23:21.440 --> 23:22.362
Door is unlocked.

23:22.600 --> 23:24.523
Give me a count of three
and then come on in.

23:24.760 --> 23:26.046
<i>Copy that.</i>

23:36.000 --> 23:37.684
I love all this subterfuge.

23:37.840 --> 23:39.888
Might our guardian angel
be the Green Arrow?

23:40.120 --> 23:42.487
This was a line item on the budget list,
and it's still not fixed.

23:42.680 --> 23:44.284
And they have the gall to fire me?

23:49.240 --> 23:50.730
This is fun, working together.

23:50.960 --> 23:52.246
Let's make this clear.

23:52.480 --> 23:55.165
This is not
a father-daughter bonding exercise.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.082
Felicity, we have personnel
walking the floor.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.201
Just go on my signal.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.720
Copy that.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.241
Look, I know I've done
what appears to be some terrible things...

24:04.480 --> 24:05.925
You tried to steal from me.

24:06.160 --> 24:07.685
Are we not stealing from you now?

24:07.920 --> 24:11.720
No. A, it's not my company anymore,
and, B, we're trying to save the world.

24:16.800 --> 24:18.086
<i>"JOHN". Hey, didn't I say go on my signal?</i>

24:18.880 --> 24:21.201
Okay, now.

24:28.320 --> 24:31.324
I'm good at solving binary problems,
but matters of the heart...

24:31.560 --> 24:32.561
Are not your forte.

24:32.760 --> 24:34.569
And stealing a processor
to save the end of the world

24:34.760 --> 24:36.444
is not the right time
for this conversation.

24:36.640 --> 24:37.721
On some level, I've always told myself

24:37.880 --> 24:40.804
I just didn't know
how to be a father or a husband...

24:41.080 --> 24:42.320
And for a smart guy,

24:42.560 --> 24:45.962
you don't seem to understand
the concept of "not the right time."

24:46.160 --> 24:48.401
I don't know
why I tried to steal your company's tech.

24:48.560 --> 24:50.130
Habit, I suppose.
Or something deeper.

24:50.320 --> 24:51.446
Ah! The son of a bitch.

24:51.640 --> 24:54.166
I've been fired for, like, 45 minutes,
and he's already locked me out.

24:54.800 --> 24:57.485
You have an electromagnetic wave generator
and a battery tender?

24:58.400 --> 24:59.765
To force a restart.

25:01.320 --> 25:02.765
Yes.

25:03.160 --> 25:04.161
Yes.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.251
There it is.

25:11.360 --> 25:12.486
Open sesame.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.281
That's it.

25:18.440 --> 25:20.363
Guys, I've got incoming.
Northeast stairwell.

25:20.600 --> 25:21.806
On it.

25:23.320 --> 25:24.526
It's under a sub-lock.

25:39.280 --> 25:41.282
It won't eject.
That never happens unless...

25:42.160 --> 25:44.561
That happens.
We can't leave without the processor.

25:44.800 --> 25:45.881
We can if we clone it.

25:46.200 --> 25:47.167
Your sniffer device.

25:47.360 --> 25:49.840
We can copy
the processor's operating code wirelessly.

25:50.040 --> 25:51.644
More movement.
Felicity, you must have tripped something

25:51.800 --> 25:53.848
because I have security
coming to the lab right now.

25:54.040 --> 25:56.122
- We're running out of time.
- The device isn't finished.

25:57.320 --> 25:58.242
- Come on.
- It's almost there.

25:59.720 --> 26:00.960
Come on.

26:01.720 --> 26:03.802
Felicity, you have to get out of there.
Security's inbound.

26:13.640 --> 26:15.051
The R and D lab is secure.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.331
I heard you needed a lift.

26:23.160 --> 26:25.083
- You're the one who arrested me.
- He's not doing that now.

26:25.320 --> 26:27.527
- You get it?
- No.

26:35.840 --> 26:36.762
How bad is it?

26:37.000 --> 26:39.287
Kuttler was able to clone
90% of the processor.

26:39.520 --> 26:41.204
He may be able to extrapolate
the remaining 10%

26:41.400 --> 26:42.561
to build us a workable processor.

26:42.760 --> 26:44.250
I'm gathering parts for him to work with.

26:44.440 --> 26:45.885
But we're still gonna need to upload
the override codes

26:46.120 --> 26:47.121
to every nuke silo individually.

26:47.360 --> 26:49.681
- Can you do that?
- Only from a server farm.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.205
Mr. Queen.

26:58.960 --> 27:01.645
My men are searching the woods
for my property.

27:02.520 --> 27:04.363
But you chose not to die with them.

27:06.200 --> 27:07.884
I killed a few of the stragglers.

27:09.560 --> 27:12.131
My power has grown beyond your imagining.

27:13.520 --> 27:14.806
Let me show you.

27:38.480 --> 27:40.528
Valiant effort, Mr. Queen.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.889
But still only mortal.

27:50.360 --> 27:53.250
The primary scrubber's in here.
I'm betting Machin is, too.

27:53.480 --> 27:55.164
Don't I get something to fight him with?

27:55.400 --> 27:57.528
I don't think I can trust you
with a weapon for some reason.

27:57.720 --> 27:59.848
You're just gonna have to make do
with Krav Maga, I'm afraid.

28:01.520 --> 28:05.445
<i>Welcome to Tevat Noah,
your home in the new era.</i>

28:11.640 --> 28:13.005
Ah, the irony.

28:13.200 --> 28:15.168
All Darhk's parasites living underground,

28:15.360 --> 28:18.091
breathing the waste product of sludge.

28:22.920 --> 28:24.251
What happens if I turn this dial?

28:26.600 --> 28:29.410
Well, if you're not gonna tell me,
I'm just gonna have to see for myself.

28:29.640 --> 28:30.607
Step away from that.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.040
Run along, little girl.

28:32.560 --> 28:34.210
I'm a tad busy at the moment
trying to kill everyone here.

28:34.440 --> 28:36.249
I'm not a little girl, Lonnie.

28:37.600 --> 28:38.647
Remember me?

28:39.680 --> 28:41.603
My name is Thea Queen.

28:42.880 --> 28:44.450
I'm the one that gave you that face.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.089
Mommy.

28:51.280 --> 28:53.521
I didn't recognize you
without the red leather.

28:53.720 --> 28:55.722
Whatever are you doing here?

28:55.960 --> 28:57.928
Look, I get it, you're mad at Darhk

28:58.120 --> 28:59.690
because he screwed you over,

28:59.920 --> 29:01.126
and now you're trying to get payback.

29:02.800 --> 29:03.926
I'm not going to stop you, okay?

29:04.120 --> 29:06.646
If anything, I'm gonna help you.

29:07.840 --> 29:10.810
But there are innocent people here,
people that have been brainwashed,

29:11.000 --> 29:13.002
and they don't deserve to die.

29:16.480 --> 29:18.642
Lonnie, don't do this.

29:19.920 --> 29:21.922
I will help you take down Darhk, okay?

29:22.120 --> 29:23.804
We can do this together.

29:24.760 --> 29:26.046
You just need to get out of here.

29:35.160 --> 29:37.891
The hell did you do that for? I had him.

29:38.080 --> 29:40.481
No, you didn't. Explosive charges.

29:41.680 --> 29:44.490
He was going to blow the scrubber
no matter what you said.

29:45.800 --> 29:48.007
- Can you disarm it?
- We'll soon find out.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.285
Clear.

29:53.800 --> 29:55.404
I'm going to need the sub node
taken offline.

29:55.640 --> 29:57.369
- Okay, I can do that.
<i>- I'll</i> cover him.

29:57.600 --> 30:01.002
I'll take care of him.
Get to work.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.570
Nice to meet you.

30:07.120 --> 30:09.691
My daughter certainly has
some very impressive friends.

30:09.880 --> 30:11.962
How long is this gonna take?

30:12.200 --> 30:14.931
Ideally, less than it takes Mr. Darhk
to nuke the world.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.202
I'm not the man
my daughter thinks, you know.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.050
Don't tell me. Tell her.

30:20.240 --> 30:21.685
I've tried.

30:22.400 --> 30:24.402
I've tried explaining that
there are two sides to me,

30:24.600 --> 30:26.489
the father and the hacker.

30:27.560 --> 30:28.721
She sees only the criminal.

30:29.920 --> 30:31.445
I mention this because you strike me

30:31.680 --> 30:34.331
as someone with experience
leading a dual life.

30:36.080 --> 30:37.525
Any insights you'd care to share?

30:37.720 --> 30:39.722
Yeah. <i>n</i> doesn't work.

30:41.680 --> 30:43.569
You leading a dual life
is why you lost her.

30:43.760 --> 30:47.048
You sound like you're talking
from some personal experience.

30:47.280 --> 30:48.247
What's that?

30:48.440 --> 30:51.728
Felicity's taken the sub node offline
and we've developed a new problem.

30:51.920 --> 30:53.888
- What?
- Tapeworm in the Rubicon code.

30:54.120 --> 30:56.885
An anti-hack failsafe
courtesy of your friends in HIVE.

30:57.120 --> 30:58.087
Well, can you override it?

30:58.280 --> 30:59.486
I just did.

30:59.680 --> 31:02.331
But not before the tapeworm transmitted
this terminal's location.

31:02.520 --> 31:04.602
- I figure we have about 90 seconds.
- Until what?

31:04.880 --> 31:08.282
Until HIVE rains
all manner of hell down on us.

31:17.120 --> 31:18.087
What happened?

31:18.280 --> 31:20.931
HIVE has our position.
We have maybe a minute before they arrive.

31:21.120 --> 31:23.043
They're working on shutting me down,
but I know a few tricks.

31:23.280 --> 31:24.520
This'll go twice as fast with two of us.

31:24.720 --> 31:26.404
We'll hold them off as long as we can.

31:26.800 --> 31:30.009
Establish a perimeter. Shoot to kill.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.763
I don't need to tell you
what's riding on this.

31:35.320 --> 31:37.288
POTUS and SecDef have taken us
to DEFCON 2.

31:37.480 --> 31:39.608
- Just 2? They're optimistic.
- They don't want to cause a panic.

31:39.800 --> 31:41.564
The President asked me
if the fate of the world is resting

31:41.760 --> 31:45.128
in the hands of an IT girl, a criminal
and two guys in Halloween costumes.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.924
They're not Halloween costumes.

32:06.680 --> 32:07.761
Get the idol!

32:18.560 --> 32:19.891
We got to go.

32:20.120 --> 32:21.167
What about Reiter?

32:21.360 --> 32:22.850
He can't do anything without the idol.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.006
Come on!

32:35.040 --> 32:37.486
If this is the end of the world,
I don't mind going out like this.

32:37.800 --> 32:38.847
Oh, don't you ever stop?

32:39.040 --> 32:40.963
Not when it comes to my daughter. No.

32:44.120 --> 32:45.406
Alex?

32:46.120 --> 32:48.327
Everything's fine.
We took out all the explosives.

32:50.280 --> 32:53.443
Alex? Alex. Oh, God, are you...

32:53.640 --> 32:58.328
Fine? Okay? Hunky-dory?

33:00.160 --> 33:03.323
Believe me, there's nothing hunky-dory

33:03.520 --> 33:05.727
about screwing up someone's plan
for vengeance a second time.

33:06.920 --> 33:09.685
Which means I've got to wait
for Mr. Darhk to arrive.

33:09.920 --> 33:11.251
Go with Plan B.

33:11.920 --> 33:14.082
It's left me with some time to kill.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.241
Soto speak.

33:17.360 --> 33:18.521
- Okay, Alex, come on...
- Relax.

33:19.680 --> 33:22.763
He's fine. Just taking a little nap.

33:27.040 --> 33:28.530
What is it with you?

33:29.400 --> 33:31.926
Why are you always
at the mercy of some guy?

33:33.760 --> 33:35.410
You can make your own decisions, Thea.

33:35.600 --> 33:37.090
You're not a pawn,

33:39.120 --> 33:40.531
you're a queen.

33:42.880 --> 33:43.927
Get it?

33:44.600 --> 33:47.080
Yeah. Yeah, I get it.

33:51.600 --> 33:52.601
Here they come.

33:54.720 --> 33:55.801
That's a lot of firepower...

33:55.960 --> 33:56.961
We don't need to beat them.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.088
We just need to buy Felicity
and her father enough time.

34:37.320 --> 34:38.321
Thea?

34:38.480 --> 34:39.844
Alex, get out of here.

34:45.159 --> 34:46.321
Get away from him.

34:46.520 --> 34:48.284
I'm liberating you, Mommy.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.525
You don't need another man
clouding your mind.

34:51.760 --> 34:53.000
Alex, run!

34:54.679 --> 34:56.011
No.

35:09.960 --> 35:11.121
Alex.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.206
No.

35:21.880 --> 35:23.211
I'm sorry.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.602
Think I got an algorithm
down to 300 lines for the uplink.

36:15.760 --> 36:17.250
Have you tried to break
the JSI encryption?

36:17.440 --> 36:20.603
- That way you can directly bypass the PAL.
- Yeah, you're right.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.170
Three minutes
till Rubicon launches the nukes.

36:36.960 --> 36:39.122
Overwatch. Amar is headed inside.

36:41.120 --> 36:42.167
We're running out of time.

36:54.480 --> 36:55.481
Are you hit?

36:55.800 --> 36:59.327
No, no, no.No.

36:59.520 --> 37:01.443
- What's happening?
- We got every nuke.

37:02.840 --> 37:03.841
Except one.

37:16.880 --> 37:18.405
We lost one. It's in the air.

37:19.640 --> 37:21.165
Headed straight for Monument Point.

37:27.320 --> 37:29.482
The bullet went through,
but I need you to hold still.

37:29.720 --> 37:33.008
I think we have more important concerns.
Such as preventing another launch.

37:33.160 --> 37:34.321
I thought you two
stopped Rubicon.

37:34.560 --> 37:37.530
Rubicon knows the missiles didn't launch,
it keeps trying to send launch codes.

37:37.680 --> 37:39.011
Which we have to override manually,
one by one.

37:39.200 --> 37:40.167
It's kinda like whack-a-mole.

37:40.400 --> 37:42.004
Except we don't get a stuffed animal
if we win.

37:42.160 --> 37:44.049
Is it true, there's one in the air?

37:44.400 --> 37:45.526
Headed straight for Monument Point.

37:45.720 --> 37:47.688
- Can you override?
- That is what I'm trying to do

37:47.880 --> 37:49.803
while Noah keeps the missiles
in their silos.

37:51.160 --> 37:52.241
We need to start evacuations.

37:52.840 --> 37:54.330
There's not enough time
to get everyone out.

37:56.840 --> 37:58.683
This is ARGUS director Lyla Michaels.

37:58.880 --> 38:00.564
I'm reporting an end-time event.

38:01.400 --> 38:02.561
Target is Monument Point.

38:05.480 --> 38:06.402
Felicity.

38:06.680 --> 38:08.170
I'm trying to hack
their navigation systems.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.487
What's that?

38:09.720 --> 38:11.404
Another hit
on the ley line algorithm I set up.

38:11.680 --> 38:13.569
I cross-referenced it
with news reports and...

38:13.720 --> 38:16.166
The mayor's office just evacuated
City Hall due to a gas leak.

38:16.320 --> 38:19.847
Like you said, why would Darhk's wife run
for mayor of a city he wants to destroy?

38:21.520 --> 38:23.443
To gain access to City Hall.

38:24.200 --> 38:25.247
For this exact moment.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.570
The nexus chamber
must be beneath that building.

38:27.720 --> 38:30.564
If he's hiding where he should be hiding
to absorb the power of the nuke attack.

38:30.760 --> 38:31.886
Let's go.

38:32.720 --> 38:34.085
You need to divert that missile.

38:34.240 --> 38:37.050
You are lucky I'm too busy to come up
with a witty response to that right now.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.408
Stop. Stop!

38:50.800 --> 38:53.280
Taiana. Are you okay? Are you hurt?

38:54.000 --> 38:55.286
Something's...

39:05.800 --> 39:07.928
- Got it. Mostly.
- What?

39:08.080 --> 39:10.765
I sent the remaining launch algorithms
into an infinite loop.

39:10.960 --> 39:13.281
Should buy the world 24 hours,
give or take.

39:13.520 --> 39:14.931
What about the nuke
headed to Monument Point?

39:15.160 --> 39:16.127
It's stubborn.

39:16.320 --> 39:17.526
There's a reason why these things
were designed

39:17.760 --> 39:19.125
to be impossible to move off course.

39:20.280 --> 39:22.886
Which is why
I have to move Monument Point instead.

39:23.120 --> 39:25.122
- GPS realignment.
- What do you mean?

39:25.320 --> 39:27.322
As a prank,
I once relocated a GPS satellite.

39:27.520 --> 39:28.521
Everyone on the Eastern Seaboard thought

39:28.800 --> 39:31.451
they were 20 miles west
of their actual location.

39:31.680 --> 39:33.648
Do that to the missile,
you avoid a direct hit.

39:41.320 --> 39:42.526
That's it.

40:00.840 --> 40:02.410
Direct hit on Havenrock.

40:04.560 --> 40:06.050
Maximum yield.

40:06.880 --> 40:08.245
How many casualties?

40:10.000 --> 40:11.411
Tens of thousands.

40:15.320 --> 40:18.051
Monument Point would have been
a couple million, Felicity.

40:33.240 --> 40:34.890
Damn it, we've searched everywhere.

41:19.440 --> 41:22.250
Hello, Oliver. Nice timing.

41:23.240 --> 41:25.766
