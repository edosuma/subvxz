Oh, a dollar.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.497
Now I can have lunch.

01:39.399 --> 01:41.033
Hmm?

01:41.035 --> 01:43.102
It's a trick!

01:49.043 --> 01:50.576
Oh, lookie here,

01:50.578 --> 01:53.445
it's the ol' fishing line
on a dollar bill prank.

01:53.447 --> 01:56.882
Man, even a backwoods,
no account, inbred,

01:56.884 --> 02:00.219
lead-paint-eating,
kerosene-huffing,

02:00.221 --> 02:04.656
roadkill-chomping, um,
what was my point?

02:06.226 --> 02:08.427
That is a practical joke, Luann.

02:08.429 --> 02:11.396
Which is too bad, because I
desperately need that dollar.

02:11.398 --> 02:14.066
I could also use the
fishing line to get some dinner.

02:14.068 --> 02:16.068
Bart, if Milhouse is
hiding with you,

02:16.070 --> 02:18.237
tell him he has to shop for
school clothes.

02:18.239 --> 02:21.039
Yay! School clothes.

02:22.575 --> 02:24.910
This isn't right, no one's
falling for my pranks.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.912
Huh!

02:26.914 --> 02:28.080
At least it wasn't
a total waste.

02:28.082 --> 02:29.248
I found a quarter.

02:32.286 --> 02:34.486
Well, we sure got him good.

Duh, what a moron, duh.

there are going to be
so many more.

remember is-- oh, my God,

Thanks to your late
football-watching,

03:59.006 --> 04:00.505
you missed breakfast.

04:00.507 --> 04:02.741
Eh, don't worry, Marge,
I'll make my own.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.644
Meh.

04:12.185 --> 04:13.252
(bell dings)

04:18.891 --> 04:21.393
Mom, I've been working on
a new solo jazz piece.

Can I hear it?

04:23.097 --> 04:26.064
(playing jazzy tune)

04:26.066 --> 04:28.634
Oh, I'd love to stay and listen,
but I'm late for work.

04:31.204 --> 04:34.006
Here's another super-fan to hear
you lay down your licks.

Do I look stupid?

05:01.101 --> 05:03.402

05:03.404 --> 05:06.738
Mmm! Wall licorice.

05:06.740 --> 05:07.906

05:07.908 --> 05:09.474
Aah!

05:10.743 --> 05:12.144
(Homer chuckling)

05:13.613 --> 05:16.581
Marge, nothing says
"I'm sorry" better than flowers.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.583
Except for fundamental
behavioral change,

05:18.585 --> 05:20.485
but you can't buy that
at the supermarket.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.587
(sniffs)
They do smell nice.

05:22.589 --> 05:24.423
Hey, Dad, want to hear
my solo?

05:24.425 --> 05:26.091
I added a few
variations today.

05:26.093 --> 05:27.926
Of course I would.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.494
Okay.
Aw, my reed is split.

05:29.496 --> 05:30.896
I'll be right back.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.599
I've already heard
Lisa's song once.

05:34.601 --> 05:37.669
I've had a long day,
and to be completely honest,

05:37.671 --> 05:40.572
I really can't stand jazz.

05:42.975 --> 05:44.843
(startled gasp)

05:46.479 --> 05:48.513
What about when
Lisa plays it?

05:48.515 --> 05:50.582
All the same. Ugh.

05:51.951 --> 05:54.853
(note plays)
MARGE: Sounds great, honey.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.555
(sobs)

06:01.294 --> 06:03.628
So, you really don't like jazz?
(chuckles)

06:03.630 --> 06:05.497
I never realized we have
so much in common.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.165
And scat-singing.

06:07.167 --> 06:10.702
She-bee-bee-dee-dee-diddly-bop-
dee-do I give a darn?

06:10.704 --> 06:13.638
So, all these years,
you've been lying to me?

06:13.640 --> 06:14.639
(both gasp)

06:14.641 --> 06:15.874
Be-beep-ba-boop-boop.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.642
So, let's get it all out here.

06:17.644 --> 06:20.045
Mom, you were only pretending
to like it this morning

06:20.047 --> 06:21.980
when I played
<i>My Funny Valentine.</i>

06:21.982 --> 06:25.150
<i>That</i> was <i>My Funny Valentine?</i>
<i>Hoo-boy.</i>

06:25.152 --> 06:27.152
Wouldn't expect you to get it.

06:27.154 --> 06:28.987
(sobbing): So busy juggling
three children,

06:28.989 --> 06:32.657
you don't even notice when
one is hanging by a thread,

06:32.659 --> 06:34.993
a thread you just cut forever!

06:34.995 --> 06:36.895
Lisa, this a family.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.531
You do not take that tone
with another family member.

06:39.533 --> 06:40.665
You tell 'em, butterbean.

06:40.667 --> 06:41.900
Shut up, idiot.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.903
Lisa, honey, you're hurt,
but hurting me back

06:44.905 --> 06:47.005
is not going to feel
as good as you think.

06:47.007 --> 06:50.208
Just know that I am
very, very sorry.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.376
Hmm!

06:51.378 --> 06:52.844
Hmph!

06:52.846 --> 06:54.012
Mm...

06:54.014 --> 06:55.046
Hmm...

06:55.048 --> 06:56.181
(high-pitched):
Mm!

06:56.183 --> 06:58.016
Hm!

06:58.018 --> 06:59.017
(groans playfully)

06:59.019 --> 07:00.552
Good night, Marjorie.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.053
(gasps)

07:02.055 --> 07:03.522
MARGE:
<i>Marjorie.</i>

07:03.524 --> 07:05.924
She called me "Mar-jo-rie."

07:05.926 --> 07:07.893
So? Bart calls me Homer.

07:07.895 --> 07:10.095
You know that's out
of disrespect.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.029
Dis-respect?

07:11.031 --> 07:12.898
Is that a word?
Yes.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.033
And there's this guy at work
that calls me Hoss.

07:15.035 --> 07:16.368
What's that all about?

07:16.370 --> 07:17.869
This is awful.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.971
Lisa and I have
always been so close.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.042
Now, for your first day
at school,

07:24.044 --> 07:26.545
you get what
my mother gave me.

07:26.547 --> 07:27.546
Pearls?

07:27.548 --> 07:28.947
Just like Mommy's.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.087
Dad, is there anything
you pass along?

07:36.089 --> 07:38.123
Predilection for kidney stones.

07:39.792 --> 07:43.895
What if Lisa doesn't want
to be friends with me anymore?

07:43.897 --> 07:47.098
Marge, it's not your job to be
friends with your kids,

07:47.100 --> 07:49.734
it's my job.
Good night, sweetie.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.069
(sighs)
Oh, uh, Bart and I

07:51.071 --> 07:53.572
are gonna see an
R-rated movie Saturday.

07:53.574 --> 07:56.107
It has boobs,
but they're elf boobs.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.108
Is that cool?

07:57.110 --> 07:58.710
Hmm. I guess.

08:00.446 --> 08:01.980
(Homer chuckles)

08:02.949 --> 08:06.117
So long, whoopee cushion.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.919
(fart noise)

08:07.921 --> 08:09.654
(sad music plays)

08:13.092 --> 08:15.093
Ah, good old
peanut brittle.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.761
What the...?

08:16.763 --> 08:19.865
A coiled wire spring covered by
a snake-patterned vinyl sheath?

08:21.767 --> 08:24.102
(boinging, whirring,
whistling)

08:24.104 --> 08:25.737
(mooing)

08:30.443 --> 08:35.113
Lisa, our weekend in Capital
City will make us friends again.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.615
I don't see your saxophone.

08:36.617 --> 08:38.350
That must be a relief to you.

08:38.352 --> 08:40.952
Honey, I want you to bring it.

08:40.954 --> 08:43.288
Sure, should I grab
some Kenny G CDs too?

08:43.290 --> 08:44.956
Some Chuck Mangione?

08:44.958 --> 08:46.458
That would be lovely!

08:46.460 --> 08:49.361
Oh, I-I get it, they're popular,
so you don't like them.

08:49.363 --> 08:52.097
Just please get your sax.

08:53.966 --> 08:55.467
Airport shuttle?

08:55.469 --> 08:58.837
Yes, I'm going on a trip
with a special little girl.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.672
That baby is adorable.

09:00.674 --> 09:03.141
Oh, it's not the baby.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.644
Great, now I've got
both daughters mad at me.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.979
May I say that you sound
like a terrible mother?

09:07.981 --> 09:10.849
But no one ever cares what
the shuttle bus driver thinks.

09:10.851 --> 09:13.151
"Take me to terminal four,"
they say.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.053
Actually, we're
at terminal three.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.822
Arguing with everyone
today, aren't you?

09:17.824 --> 09:19.724
Okay, we'll see you
on Monday, Homer.

09:24.030 --> 09:26.064
I'm feeling really sad too, Dad.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.866
Nothing cheers people
up like a baby.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.668
Hey!

09:29.670 --> 09:31.836
Boy, we each have to do our
part, and I'm gonna make dinner.

09:31.838 --> 09:32.904
And I'm gonna start with...

09:32.906 --> 09:34.673
(gentle, happy melody playing)

09:34.675 --> 09:36.241
Ice cream!

09:36.243 --> 09:37.509
Come back!

09:37.511 --> 09:39.210
Don't make me jog.

09:39.212 --> 09:42.881
Why is your father chasing
after the spay and neuter van?

09:42.883 --> 09:44.082
You got me.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.483
What do I do with you?

09:48.054 --> 09:49.955
(chuckles)
Hey, this is fun.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.194
(groans affectionately)

09:56.196 --> 09:57.862
Wow. Wow!

09:57.864 --> 09:59.364
I like having a sister.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.433
Helps that you
don't say anything.

10:01.435 --> 10:02.601
♪

10:22.121 --> 10:24.956
I wonder how you are at pranks.

We're not worthy.

I'm back!

ordinary hot dog vendor.

10:50.984 --> 10:54.152
Wow, he's anything <i>but</i> ordinary.

10:56.255 --> 10:57.922
You know, I wouldn't
be surprised
