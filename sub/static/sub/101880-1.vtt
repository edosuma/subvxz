04:30.822 --> 04:33.065
you know, you pay a
little bit every month.

04:58.470 --> 04:59.851
Can you get dinner on?

05:01.370 --> 05:02.612

09:53.454 --> 09:54.835
In the words of Valentino,

09:56.078 --> 09:58.080
I'm not afraid of
the dead, or ghosts.

09:59.288 --> 10:01.324
I'm not afraid of
the life beyond.

10:01.359 --> 10:03.672
And it's not because
I don't believe in it.

10:04.949 --> 10:06.295
It's because I do.

10:14.441 --> 10:16.167
- Better not get fired for this.

10:19.170 --> 10:23.001
- [sighs] Jo, stop
being such a worrywort.

10:23.830 --> 10:25.866
- Now think about your question,

10:25.901 --> 10:28.973
and put all of that
energy into the cards.

10:30.768 --> 10:33.253

- Let's hide in Leech's office!

10:48.371 --> 10:50.373
[panting]

10:53.031 --> 10:55.344
Mr. Leech's office is cold.

10:57.139 --> 10:59.348
- What if it's Leech?
- What if it's Butkiss?

10:59.382 --> 11:00.763
- What if it's Mr. Roeder?

11:14.501 --> 11:16.572
- It looks like
a galaxy in here.

11:16.606 --> 11:18.194
- Yeah, it does.

11:18.229 --> 11:20.162
If you let your
eyes go all soft,

11:20.196 --> 11:21.473
it looks like the night sky.

11:24.028 --> 11:25.685
- Wow, look at this clock.

11:29.274 --> 11:30.690
- [Bessie] What...

11:33.451 --> 11:34.486
It's Mary.

11:36.074 --> 11:37.075
- [Walt] Is she famous?

11:37.110 --> 11:39.457
- No, no, she's my sister.

11:39.491 --> 11:40.838
She used to work here.

11:43.530 --> 11:45.325
She passed away three years ago.

11:46.326 --> 11:48.880
She practically
raised me and Jo.

11:48.915 --> 11:50.882
Our parents died
when we were young.

11:50.917 --> 11:52.401
- Sorry.

11:52.435 --> 11:56.163
- Mr. Leech is such a creep. - No kidding.

11:58.821 --> 12:00.305
- Hey...

12:00.340 --> 12:03.032
Do you wanna go to a party maybe with me next weekend?

12:03.930 --> 12:06.518
- A party? [laughs]

12:06.553 --> 12:08.555
I love parties!

12:08.589 --> 12:11.592
[laughs] Yeah, sure!

13:38.265 --> 13:39.163
- Hey, Mary.

13:39.197 --> 13:39.991
Um...

13:41.165 --> 13:42.822
I'm sorry I've been
hiding from you.

13:47.136 --> 13:51.623
Look what I found in Mr. Leech's office, of all places.

13:58.389 --> 14:01.323
[dramatic music]

14:07.329 --> 14:08.399
What is this?

14:31.215 --> 14:33.527
"Pardon me, but I'm in love."

14:36.047 --> 14:38.256
[gasping]

14:39.154 --> 14:40.155
I'm in love?

14:45.263 --> 14:46.057
Jo!

14:46.955 --> 14:47.679
Jo!

14:53.962 --> 14:55.377
Jo, Jo, are you in there?

14:55.411 --> 14:57.724
Jo!
- Don't come in, please.

14:57.758 --> 14:59.795
- Jo, was Mary in
love with Leech?

14:59.829 --> 15:01.521
- You'll wake the
neighborhood, Bessie.

15:01.555 --> 15:02.487
- What?

15:02.522 --> 15:03.592
I'm coming in.

15:03.626 --> 15:05.249
Josephine?

15:05.283 --> 15:07.423
- Do you understand
what go away means?

15:09.839 --> 15:11.151
- Um...
- Please leave.

15:14.361 --> 15:16.950
- Jo, I think that
you need a doctor.

15:16.985 --> 15:18.227
- No, I just feel tired.

15:20.195 --> 15:22.197
You can tell Butkiss
I'll be late today.

15:26.442 --> 15:27.443
- Okay.

15:41.526 --> 15:44.391
Oh, um, Mr. Roeder, sir?

15:44.426 --> 15:45.772
Hi.
- Yes, what is it?

15:45.806 --> 15:49.776
- Do you know of a doctor that my sister Jo could go see?

15:49.810 --> 15:52.434
I don't know what's wrong with her exactly, but...

15:52.468 --> 15:53.331
- Does she work here?

15:54.436 --> 15:56.610
- Yes, Josephine Cavallo.

15:56.645 --> 15:58.854
She won the most painted
dials this month.

15:59.820 --> 16:02.340
- Ah, I'm very busy.

16:02.375 --> 16:03.686
- Wait, no no, please, please!

16:05.067 --> 16:06.620
Please.

16:06.655 --> 16:08.105
- All right.

16:08.139 --> 16:11.073
I'll have the company doctor call on her this week.

16:12.143 --> 16:12.937
- Thank you, sir.

16:12.972 --> 16:13.765
Thank you so much.

16:15.388 --> 16:17.252
- Bessie Cavallo!

16:17.286 --> 16:18.287
Get in here.

16:24.052 --> 16:25.398
Any day, Cavallo.

16:27.848 --> 16:30.541
[clocks ticking]

16:35.753 --> 16:37.927
I've been wondering if the world

16:37.962 --> 16:41.448
isn't one universe, but many.

16:41.483 --> 16:42.415
A multiverse.

16:44.865 --> 16:49.491
One for each future
that could've been.

16:52.390 --> 16:54.910
Listen, Mary--
- It's Bessie.

17:03.436 --> 17:05.403
- Your work suffers,
Ms. Cavallo.

17:07.405 --> 17:08.958
The four is abominable,

17:08.992 --> 17:11.444
and the eight looks
like a fat toddler.

17:13.963 --> 17:15.550
I'm docking your pay again.

17:21.178 --> 17:22.386
- Is that all?

17:23.594 --> 17:25.214
- We have to sell
the watches you paint

17:25.251 --> 17:26.733
for the same price
as all the rest.

17:26.769 --> 17:28.530
Do you understand
that, Ms. Cavallo?

17:30.186 --> 17:31.015
- Yes, I do.

17:32.775 --> 17:33.569
- Do you?

17:36.814 --> 17:38.367
- I do, Mr. Leech.

17:43.131 --> 17:45.547
[light music]

17:56.972 --> 17:59.216
[knocking]

18:01.425 --> 18:03.082
- Josephine Cavallo?

18:03.116 --> 18:04.566
- I'm Bessie, come on in.

18:06.430 --> 18:07.845
Jo, he's here!

18:12.470 --> 18:15.611
- Hello.
- I'm Dr. Flint.

18:15.646 --> 18:16.371
- Jo.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.963
- You've been under the weather?

18:22.998 --> 18:24.275
- I'm dizzy.

18:24.310 --> 18:25.414
My joints ache.

18:26.415 --> 18:28.590
I lost a tooth, and
two others are loose.

18:28.624 --> 18:29.418
- Hmm...

18:30.316 --> 18:31.834
Now aren't you falling apart?

18:34.665 --> 18:36.287
Open.

18:36.322 --> 18:37.254
Tongue out.

18:40.188 --> 18:42.811
Is good hygiene
difficult for you?

18:44.571 --> 18:45.365
- No.

18:45.986 --> 18:47.436
- I'm going to give you
a pamphlet I produced

18:47.471 --> 18:48.817
at Columbia University.

18:50.232 --> 18:54.685
We may have different definitions of good hygiene.

18:55.962 --> 18:57.619
- Do you know what's
wrong with me?

18:58.654 --> 18:59.828
- Absolutely nothing.

19:01.243 --> 19:02.831
You're as healthy as a horse.

19:02.865 --> 19:04.798
- But the pain, sir?

19:07.042 --> 19:10.010
- I can run a few tests that'll make you feel better.

19:11.840 --> 19:12.841
- Thank you.

19:14.429 --> 19:15.878
- Okay, open up.

19:17.259 --> 19:18.087
- Ow.

19:21.919 --> 19:23.403
Ow.

19:23.438 --> 19:24.439
- Hmm...

19:29.029 --> 19:30.203
Thank you, Josephine.

19:32.447 --> 19:33.448
- Thank you.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.765
Maybe I should just stay
home with you tonight.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.526
What if Walt wants to...

19:42.560 --> 19:43.837
What if he wants to...

19:45.425 --> 19:46.806
Do it.

19:46.840 --> 19:48.532
- Tell him you're
joining a convent.

19:48.566 --> 19:52.156
- What if he tries to talk to me about politics

19:52.191 --> 19:54.917
and realizes that I'm not smart?

19:54.952 --> 19:56.402
- You're plenty smart.

19:57.679 --> 19:59.853
Just not about politics.

19:59.888 --> 20:04.030
- Josephine, can you
just give me something?

20:04.064 --> 20:04.858
Please?

20:08.034 --> 20:10.070
- Congress is carving a monument

20:10.105 --> 20:12.418
into a South Dakota mountain.

20:12.452 --> 20:15.179
For tourism, you know,
presidents' faces.

20:17.664 --> 20:19.287
- Why do you know that?

20:20.184 --> 20:21.358
- It reminds me of the pyramids.

20:29.883 --> 20:31.678
Be careful, okay?

20:31.713 --> 20:32.507
- Yeah.

20:33.991 --> 20:35.303
You should get some rest.

20:39.583 --> 20:42.137
[soft music]

21:06.437 --> 21:08.991
- Hope you're not
an ax murderer.

21:09.026 --> 21:10.372
- It's too late for
you now if I am.

21:12.478 --> 21:14.859
- I'm not going
to sleep with you.

21:14.894 --> 21:15.688
- Ever?

21:16.447 --> 21:18.725
[laughs]

21:18.760 --> 21:19.657
- Go ahead.

21:20.969 --> 21:23.282
[knocking]

21:24.697 --> 21:26.492
- Password?
- Garbanzo.

21:28.459 --> 21:31.220
- I've never been to a party with a password before.

21:32.981 --> 21:33.982
- Welcome.

21:34.016 --> 21:36.502
[upbeat music]

21:40.609 --> 21:42.301
- You made it!

21:42.335 --> 21:43.405
Have you seen the
new protest footage?

21:43.440 --> 21:44.372
- No.

21:44.406 --> 21:45.511
- Welcome.
- Hi, I'm Bessie.

21:45.545 --> 21:46.581
- Thomas.
- Nice to meet you.

21:46.615 --> 21:49.100
- Make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

21:49.135 --> 21:52.138
[people chattering]

22:05.013 --> 22:06.704
- Wasted resources
in that country.

22:06.739 --> 22:07.636
- Exactly.

22:07.671 --> 22:08.982
- We should be worried about

22:09.017 --> 22:11.295
what's going on
in the home front.

22:13.228 --> 22:14.194
- Hi.
- Hey.

22:16.404 --> 22:19.027
- Oh my, are your nails glowin'?

22:19.959 --> 22:22.375
- I'm Bessie.
- Etta.

22:23.687 --> 22:26.137
- Bessie, Etta is one of the best camera operators

22:26.172 --> 22:27.449
this side of the Mississippi.

22:27.484 --> 22:28.312
- She sure is.

22:29.313 --> 22:30.763
- Do you shoot motion pictures?

22:33.386 --> 22:36.803
Have you seen
Valentino's latest?

22:36.838 --> 22:38.529
- I shoot real life.

22:38.564 --> 22:41.463
[shutter clicking]

22:43.120 --> 22:48.125
- If I could just live inside one of his films, I would.

22:49.264 --> 22:50.334
- Those films are made
to distract people

22:50.369 --> 22:53.164
from what's goin' on
right in front of 'em.

22:53.199 --> 22:55.166
- What are we
talkin' about here?

22:55.201 --> 22:56.236
- Cinema.

22:56.271 --> 22:57.997
- Hollywood pushing propaganda.

23:01.656 --> 23:04.452
- Wanna go outside?
- Yeah, sure.

23:05.729 --> 23:07.593
- Lovely to meet
you, Thomas, Etta.

23:07.627 --> 23:08.387
- Yes.

23:09.457 --> 23:11.355
- Wait, who's she?

23:13.771 --> 23:14.531
- Bess.

23:18.880 --> 23:22.124
- Did you know that Congress is building a mountain

23:22.159 --> 23:23.436
into the side...

23:25.576 --> 23:28.199
No, no, that's not what I meant!

23:28.234 --> 23:31.133
I meant that they are
carving a sculpture

23:31.168 --> 23:33.412
into the side of a mountain.

23:33.446 --> 23:34.516
Presidents' faces.

23:34.551 --> 23:36.829
- Yeah, it's on sacred
Native American land.

23:38.382 --> 23:40.557
- Yeah, it reminds
me of the pyramids.

23:42.179 --> 23:44.215
- Did you know they were
built by slave labor?

23:46.425 --> 23:48.323
- I did not.

23:48.357 --> 23:50.636
But Jo knows
everything about them.

23:53.777 --> 23:55.364
There's something
wrong with her.

23:56.365 --> 23:58.644
- With who?
- Jo.

24:00.473 --> 24:04.373
- She lost a tooth, and
her face is all puffy.

24:06.168 --> 24:07.342
- Did she see a doctor?

24:08.481 --> 24:12.451
- Mr. Roeder, from
work, sent us someone.

24:12.485 --> 24:15.557
And he's running some tests, but he says that she's fine.

24:15.592 --> 24:16.385
- Um...

24:17.870 --> 24:20.631
Well, I know of this woman who helps sick workers.

24:21.874 --> 24:23.531
May be a long shot, but...

24:24.428 --> 24:25.774
- Yes, please, anything.

24:33.195 --> 24:34.818
Full service here, huh?

24:37.234 --> 24:39.685
[bright music]

24:51.973 --> 24:52.767
- How's Jo?

24:54.769 --> 24:57.392
- We're still waiting
on the doctor's results.

24:58.462 --> 24:59.256
Thanks.

25:25.213 --> 25:27.111
- This is a waste of time.

25:27.146 --> 25:27.974
- No it's not.

25:35.361 --> 25:37.432
Uh, 'scuse me sir?

25:37.466 --> 25:40.021
I'm looking for Miss--
- Call me Wiley.

25:42.437 --> 25:44.853
- Tea?
- No thank you.

25:47.753 --> 25:49.927
- What brings you to
the Consumer's League?

25:49.962 --> 25:51.998
- Walt gave me your card

25:52.033 --> 25:54.380
after I told him
that Jo was sick.

25:54.414 --> 25:57.245
He said that you
help sick workers.

25:57.279 --> 25:58.971
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm Jo.

25:59.005 --> 26:00.386
- This isn't a doctor's office.

26:00.420 --> 26:02.284
- I'm not a doctor.

26:02.319 --> 26:04.045
- Then how do you
help sick workers?

26:05.736 --> 26:07.704
I told you this was
a waste of time.

26:07.738 --> 26:09.326
- Just because you don't
like Walt doesn't--

26:09.360 --> 26:11.880
- Girls, girls.

26:11.915 --> 26:12.847
Where do you work?

26:14.055 --> 26:14.987
- American Radium.

26:16.436 --> 26:17.817
- Ah.

26:17.852 --> 26:19.301
You're dial painters.

26:19.336 --> 26:20.268
- Yes.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.339
- What do you do here?

26:23.547 --> 26:26.205
- We study industrial toxins

26:26.239 --> 26:28.345
and use the legal system
to protect workers

26:28.379 --> 26:29.346
from exposure to them.

26:31.659 --> 26:33.212
We've been collecting data

26:33.246 --> 26:36.284
on a number of suspicious radium dial painter illnesses.

26:37.423 --> 26:38.217
- Pardon me?

26:39.425 --> 26:41.392
- We believe that
exposure to radium

26:41.427 --> 26:44.188
can cause devastating
tissue damage.

26:45.224 --> 26:49.021
- Tissue damage?
- Wait, radium?

26:49.055 --> 26:54.060
- [laughs] Radium is good for you, everyone knows that.

26:55.475 --> 26:57.236
- And how do you
plan on proving it?

26:58.478 --> 27:00.998
- We've been trying to exhume a deceased dial painter.

27:03.035 --> 27:06.038
It's the first step
in understanding what
could be going on.

27:08.557 --> 27:11.353
- What's exhume?
- It's dig up.

27:13.252 --> 27:14.771
- Our sister was a dial painter.

27:15.979 --> 27:17.463
She passed away three years ago.

27:18.429 --> 27:19.396
Um, syphilis.

27:20.604 --> 27:21.640
- How dare you?

27:22.537 --> 27:26.506
- That's a convenient diagnosis.

27:26.541 --> 27:29.061
Something a woman would never want to talk about.

27:34.031 --> 27:36.758
This could be the breakthrough we've been waiting for.

27:38.795 --> 27:41.211
With your permission--
- We're leaving.

27:41.245 --> 27:44.041
- Thank you.
- Think about it.

27:46.837 --> 27:49.288
- Thank you.
- I'll be here.

27:50.358 --> 27:52.947
[light music]

28:11.241 --> 28:12.932
- They're cursed, you know. - Who?

28:14.347 --> 28:17.385
- [Bessie] Those men who unearthed King Tut's tomb.

28:20.837 --> 28:22.735
- Curses aren't real.

28:22.770 --> 28:24.599
- They are if you
desecrate the dead.

28:28.327 --> 28:30.294
In the Book Of The Dead, it says that in the afterlife

28:30.329 --> 28:33.539
your heart is weighed against the feather of truth.

28:34.782 --> 28:37.474
[dramatic music]

28:41.271 --> 28:43.376
If your heart is lighter
than the feather,

28:43.411 --> 28:47.933
then your soul goes on
to meet the sun god, Ra.

28:52.075 --> 28:57.011
But, if it's heavier,
then you get devoured

28:57.045 --> 28:58.184
by the soul eater.

28:59.220 --> 29:02.499
- It's a myth, Bessie.
- Says you.

29:03.293 --> 29:04.432
- It was real to them.

29:07.504 --> 29:09.333
[thunder crashing]

29:09.368 --> 29:11.922
I'm scared of the soul eater.

29:11.957 --> 29:13.510
That's why I always
tell the truth.

29:15.201 --> 29:15.995
- Oh, do you?

29:18.446 --> 29:21.000
- Maat, goddess of the truth.

29:23.175 --> 29:24.763
- [Josephine] I
prefer artifacts.

29:33.910 --> 29:36.222
[knocking]

29:39.122 --> 29:42.435
- Dr. Flint!
- Is Josephine home?

29:42.470 --> 29:44.161
- Yes actually, she's here.

29:44.196 --> 29:44.990
Come in.

29:54.482 --> 29:56.725
- I wanted to bring you
the results right away.

29:56.760 --> 29:57.554
- What is it?

29:58.417 --> 30:00.039
- I'm afraid you have syphilis.

30:02.283 --> 30:05.251
You're in shock, I can tell.

30:05.286 --> 30:06.459
It's a nasty disease.

30:07.426 --> 30:09.462
- No, it's impossible.

30:09.497 --> 30:10.291
I'm a virgin.

30:14.571 --> 30:16.159
- Aren't we all?
- Dr. Flint!

30:18.023 --> 30:19.956
- Some of the symptoms
can be managed,

30:19.990 --> 30:22.027
but I'm afraid there is no cure.

30:24.236 --> 30:25.030
I'm sorry.

30:26.617 --> 30:27.998
You have any questions?

30:30.035 --> 30:32.175
- Syphilis?
- Uh, no.

30:33.762 --> 30:35.281
- [Grandpa] Who has syphilis?

30:35.316 --> 30:36.731
Not Josephine!

30:36.765 --> 30:38.181
- Grandpa, you don't know what you're talking about.

30:38.215 --> 30:40.355
Lazy old man.
- Go to your room!

30:44.325 --> 30:45.257
- Go on!

30:47.846 --> 30:49.019
- [Bessie] Jo!

31:05.001 --> 31:08.245
I found this diary
in Mary's old chest.

31:18.152 --> 31:18.946
Jo, listen.

31:20.844 --> 31:23.882
"Sweet Leech is acting strange.

31:23.916 --> 31:26.091
"He warned me not
to lick the brush.

31:27.368 --> 31:29.577
"Mrs. Butkiss says it will put a glow in my cheeks,

31:29.611 --> 31:33.753
"but Leech says that
radium is dangerous.

31:33.788 --> 31:35.376
"Could that be true?"

31:37.965 --> 31:38.862
- Leech said that?

31:40.346 --> 31:41.554
- I guess so, but...

31:48.837 --> 31:50.874
You're making my serious face.

31:53.566 --> 31:54.843
I believe you, you know.

31:56.949 --> 31:58.157
You can't have syphilis.

32:02.127 --> 32:04.474
I mean, you hate boys!

32:08.892 --> 32:11.412
Dr. Flint is not a
very good doctor.

32:12.482 --> 32:13.448
- Yeah.

32:15.140 --> 32:16.244
Or he's lying.

32:20.973 --> 32:22.906
- Kiss from Maat,
goddess of truth?

32:32.364 --> 32:33.365
- We have to do it.

32:36.333 --> 32:39.129
- Do you think that
Mary will forgive us?

32:39.164 --> 32:39.958
- I do.

32:41.925 --> 32:44.548
I think she'd like being part of solving this mystery.

32:47.241 --> 32:48.035
- Yeah.

32:53.143 --> 32:55.352
[sighing]

32:56.146 --> 32:58.838
[dramatic music]

33:22.552 --> 33:25.037
- Levels of radioactivity in Mary's bones

33:25.072 --> 33:28.454
are one thousand
times the safe limit.

33:28.489 --> 33:30.870
Radium poisoning was
her cause of death.

33:37.084 --> 33:39.707
- I thought you were just magic.

33:40.639 --> 33:42.848
[sobbing]

33:47.646 --> 33:49.372
It's gonna be better.

34:04.559 --> 34:06.320
- What does this mean for us?

34:06.354 --> 34:07.942
- I'm afraid you're
both at risk.

34:09.771 --> 34:11.635
Dr. Marland can examine you now.

34:14.328 --> 34:16.882
[tense music]

34:40.594 --> 34:42.804
[sobbing]

34:55.300 --> 34:59.166
- Ms. Cavallo, you're luckyyou didn't lick the paintbrush.

34:59.199 --> 35:00.512
It may have saved your life.

35:02.445 --> 35:07.380
Josephine, as the infection in your jaw progresses,

35:07.415 --> 35:09.831
bone removal may
become necessary.

35:10.831 --> 35:13.145
I estimate it will be two years

35:13.179 --> 35:15.734
before the radium
necrosis becomes fatal.

35:26.331 --> 35:29.056
[dramatic music]

36:15.863 --> 36:17.347
- We shot this
footage last weekend

36:17.382 --> 36:20.316
in front of the New
York Stock Exchange.

36:20.350 --> 36:23.698
Sacco and Vanzetti have been wrongfully convicted of murder

36:23.733 --> 36:26.218
because of their
political beliefs.

36:26.253 --> 36:29.946
They're sentenced to death by a jury afraid of anarchists.

36:31.085 --> 36:33.329
- [Bessie] Is it illegal
to be an anarchist?

36:33.363 --> 36:34.295
- No.

36:34.330 --> 36:35.572
It's illegal to convict people

36:35.607 --> 36:37.436
because you don't
like their politics.

36:40.439 --> 36:42.545
Anti-radical sentiment
is running high,

36:42.579 --> 36:45.168
and it doesn't help
that they're immigrants.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.274
- What does it take to be heard?

36:48.240 --> 36:50.518
These men, they are innocent!

36:50.553 --> 36:53.072
And the people will bring the truth to the light.

36:53.107 --> 36:54.212
- [All] Here, here!

36:55.627 --> 36:58.354
- [Bessie] I've never seen anything like this before.

36:58.388 --> 37:00.390
- Look how many
people are out there.

37:01.529 --> 37:02.703
- These people are marching

37:02.737 --> 37:04.601
because they care
about the truth, right?

37:09.917 --> 37:12.920
If people knew the truth about radium, they would march too.

37:17.821 --> 37:20.410
[light music]

37:47.713 --> 37:49.991
[coughing]

38:08.976 --> 38:10.943
Everyone, put down your brushes!

38:10.978 --> 38:12.082
- Miss Cavallo!

38:14.499 --> 38:16.259
- An autopsy of Mary showed

38:16.294 --> 38:18.779
that there was
radium in her bones.

38:18.813 --> 38:20.539
Jo and I were just examined.

38:20.574 --> 38:22.886
- Miss Cavallo, you
are sorely mistaken

38:22.921 --> 38:25.303
if you think that you can continue working here.

38:25.337 --> 38:26.545
- I quit.

38:26.580 --> 38:28.340
Everyone, you have to
come to the doctor!

38:28.375 --> 38:30.273
- Oh my God.
- What is she...

38:30.308 --> 38:31.481
- Keep working!

38:31.516 --> 38:33.276
Bessie, you're trespassing.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.382
- Radium is poison!

38:35.416 --> 38:36.555
I won't abandon you!

38:36.590 --> 38:38.868
- That's enough, Miss Cavallo!

38:38.902 --> 38:41.905
[workers muttering]

39:10.934 --> 39:12.350
- Why didn't you ask me first?

39:16.906 --> 39:19.598
- I thought you'd
be proud of me.

39:22.290 --> 39:23.982
- Bessie, we have no income now.

39:25.397 --> 39:26.467
Do you understand?

39:27.986 --> 39:29.608
We only have our savings left.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.681
- Selfish girl.

39:36.304 --> 39:38.376
Tomorrow you go ask
for your job back.

39:41.344 --> 39:43.070
- No!
- I mean it.

39:43.104 --> 39:43.898
- No!

39:49.732 --> 39:52.217
[soft music]

40:00.225 --> 40:01.433
Everybody's mad at me.

40:02.814 --> 40:04.125
- I'm sorry.

40:04.160 --> 40:05.851
Are you gonna look
for another job?

40:07.474 --> 40:09.441
- Anything but dial painting.

40:10.511 --> 40:14.032
- Well, don't apply to
the fireworks factory.

40:15.274 --> 40:16.655
- Huh?

40:16.690 --> 40:19.451
- Or the hattery, or the shoe factory, or the canning plant.

40:22.558 --> 40:25.457
White phosphorus,
mercury, benzene.

40:25.492 --> 40:26.527
Chronic toxins.

40:26.562 --> 40:27.459
- Okay, okay.

40:27.494 --> 40:28.874
Thanks for the pep talk, Walt.

40:31.152 --> 40:32.430
This is serious.

40:33.603 --> 40:37.158
Okay, girls are still working at the radium factory.

40:37.193 --> 40:38.401
- I know.

40:38.436 --> 40:39.229
It's just...

40:40.576 --> 40:42.612
There's a lot of world
out there to change.

40:44.165 --> 40:46.582
I don't want to
see you let down.

40:46.616 --> 40:48.307
The legal system won't help you.

40:50.758 --> 40:53.347
[pensive music]

41:13.332 --> 41:15.990
[horn blaring]

41:16.853 --> 41:18.372
- Hey, Paula, Paula!

41:18.406 --> 41:20.374
Hey, I'm trying to help you!

41:20.408 --> 41:22.687
Paula, listen, what
about your little boy?

41:22.721 --> 41:24.067
Listen to me, there is a doctor

41:24.102 --> 41:26.345
that can test if your
bones are radioactive.

41:27.381 --> 41:28.969
- I don't know if I believe you.

41:29.003 --> 41:31.523
- Paula, six dial painters have already died

41:31.558 --> 41:34.319
of inexplicable causes, one of them was my sister!

41:34.353 --> 41:35.803
Do you believe that?

41:39.393 --> 41:41.844
Hazel, Hazel, Hazel,
thank goodness!

41:41.878 --> 41:44.329
Hazel, don't you believe me?

41:44.363 --> 41:46.365
- Bessie, you sound crazy.

41:46.400 --> 41:48.436
I'm not losing my job over this!

41:49.817 --> 41:50.611
- Stop!

41:53.959 --> 41:56.617
Don't you at least want
to know for yourselves?

42:04.314 --> 42:06.351
[knocking]

42:11.390 --> 42:12.668
Hi, can I help you?

42:12.702 --> 42:13.979
- We were sent by
American Radium.

42:14.014 --> 42:17.742
We're looking for Bessie
and Josephine Cavallo.

42:18.950 --> 42:21.021
- Yes, I'm Bessie.
- What is it?

42:21.055 --> 42:23.575
- It's an offer from
American Radium.

42:24.611 --> 42:27.924
300 dollars to
appease your concerns.

42:29.857 --> 42:32.342
- It's about the
radium poisoning?

42:32.377 --> 42:35.242
- No, this doesn't say
anything about that.

42:35.276 --> 42:38.072
- [Man In Suit] AmericanRadium cares for its employees.

42:40.281 --> 42:42.111
- What is the 300 dollars for?

42:43.526 --> 42:44.320
- Your signature.

42:47.668 --> 42:49.359
- Oh boy..
- I know.

42:50.671 --> 42:51.948
- 300 each?

42:53.916 --> 42:55.193
- We can't take this!

42:55.227 --> 42:57.057
- Bessie, this is
a lot of money.

42:57.091 --> 42:59.128
- The offer stands for one week.

43:00.439 --> 43:01.440
Think about it.

43:02.303 --> 43:07.170
- Thank you very much.

43:07.205 --> 43:09.690
- 300 dollars, that's
30 thousand dials!

43:11.105 --> 43:11.830
- No.

43:13.211 --> 43:14.868
I would like to see
what Wiley has to say

43:14.902 --> 43:16.145
at the meeting tomorrow.

43:17.767 --> 43:20.459
[bell chiming]

43:37.476 --> 43:39.271
- Say, isn't that festive?

43:39.306 --> 43:40.203
- Doris!

43:41.791 --> 43:42.620
- Mary?

43:43.690 --> 43:45.312
You look so good.

43:47.003 --> 43:48.556
Look at you!

43:48.591 --> 43:50.697
- Hi, it's--

43:50.731 --> 43:53.458
Thank you, but I'm Bessie.

43:53.492 --> 43:57.393
I'm Mary's little sister.

43:57.427 --> 44:00.914
- Bessie, Bessie...

44:00.948 --> 44:05.850
- You know me, I just haven't seen you since Mary's funeral.

44:05.884 --> 44:08.300
- Bessie, of course!

44:08.335 --> 44:10.371
And Josephine!

44:11.234 --> 44:13.409
Hello.
- Hello, Doris.

44:13.443 --> 44:14.652
- Hello!

44:17.240 --> 44:19.139
I need to sit down.
- Sure.

44:23.799 --> 44:25.524
- Wasn't it a lifetime
ago Mary and I

44:25.559 --> 44:28.424
used to paint those dials for our boys overseas.

44:30.184 --> 44:32.531
- Doris, what brings you here?

44:33.636 --> 44:35.707
- Dr. Flint treated
me for years.

44:36.881 --> 44:39.677
He helped me with
the pain, good man.

44:40.781 --> 44:42.369
That's how Wiley found me.

44:45.510 --> 44:47.581
- I'm so pleased
you're all here.

44:47.615 --> 44:50.480
Paula, Bessie, Jo, I
believe you know Doris.

44:57.004 --> 44:58.903
- I thought dozens of
us were tested positive.

44:58.937 --> 45:00.076
Where's everyone else?

45:01.906 --> 45:03.562
- Um, well...

45:04.771 --> 45:08.498
Ingrid would not
quit, and Edna...

45:08.533 --> 45:12.364
Her father works
for American Radium.

45:12.399 --> 45:13.572
- I say they're in denial.

45:14.781 --> 45:16.575
- Yes, or they took the money.

45:16.610 --> 45:17.749
- And why shouldn't we?

45:17.784 --> 45:18.923
I have a family.

45:20.303 --> 45:24.307
- With the 300 we could live the next two years in peace.

45:24.342 --> 45:26.482
- An illusion of peace.

45:26.516 --> 45:29.105
- In this offer, American Radium

45:29.140 --> 45:31.936
is denying the harmful
effects of radium.

45:32.902 --> 45:34.386
They're trying to silence you.

45:34.421 --> 45:36.423
They must be stopped.

45:36.457 --> 45:38.425
- By us?
- Precisely.

45:39.391 --> 45:40.185
- Wiley, how?

45:41.497 --> 45:43.326
- We bring a lawsuit
against them.

45:43.361 --> 45:46.674
Force them to recognize radium is an industrial toxin.

45:46.709 --> 45:48.366
The factory will be shut down.

45:48.400 --> 45:49.954
- And how many jobs
will that take away?

45:49.988 --> 45:51.369
- They're toxic jobs.

45:51.403 --> 45:53.267
- Some people need those jobs,

45:53.302 --> 45:54.441
and they're gonna
blame us for this.

45:54.475 --> 45:55.338
- Paula...

45:57.340 --> 45:58.928
I know you're here for a reason.

46:01.275 --> 46:02.276
- Sounds hard.

46:03.415 --> 46:05.279
We just need help with
the medical bills.

46:05.314 --> 46:06.591
- It is hard.

46:06.625 --> 46:08.351
But if you commit,
we can find a lawyer

46:08.386 --> 46:11.976
and sue American Radium for the compensation you deserve.

46:12.839 --> 46:13.632
- Look at us.

46:15.220 --> 46:17.326
How are you gonna
find us a lawyer?

46:17.360 --> 46:19.224
- In a past life I was a lawyer.

46:20.191 --> 46:21.882
- Is she serious?

46:21.917 --> 46:24.264
- But it was just
so much shouting.

46:24.298 --> 46:27.094
- Girls, powerful women behind the Consumer's League

46:27.129 --> 46:29.614
like Alice Hamilton are with us.

46:29.648 --> 46:30.408
Trust me.

46:33.411 --> 46:37.311
[dial whirring]
[phone ringing]

46:37.346 --> 46:39.348
- Hi, my name is Bessie Cavallo.

46:39.382 --> 46:41.971
I'm with the Consumer's
League of New Jersey.

46:42.006 --> 46:44.318
I worked at American
Radium Corporation

46:44.353 --> 46:45.803
and I was seeking a lawyer--

46:45.837 --> 46:48.357
- [Caller] We're not getting involved in this.

46:49.392 --> 46:50.704
- Hello?

46:50.738 --> 46:52.154
I'm sorry?
- How old are you?

46:52.188 --> 46:53.845
- I'm 17.

46:53.880 --> 46:56.158
I'm seeking a lawyer to--

46:56.192 --> 46:57.745
Hello?

46:57.780 --> 46:58.954
- [Female Caller] I'm
sorry honey, honestly.

46:58.988 --> 47:01.749
It's not you, it's
what you're up against.

47:01.784 --> 47:04.062
- [Male Caller] American
Radium's a good company.

47:04.097 --> 47:05.339
Why are you stirring things up?

47:05.374 --> 47:06.754
- Imagine this, okay?

47:06.789 --> 47:10.344
A sunny studio, young
women working so hard

47:10.379 --> 47:14.314
painting watch dials, instructed to lick the brush.

47:14.348 --> 47:16.903
- Whatever it takes,
you understand?

47:18.283 --> 47:20.354
- The paint, poison.

47:20.389 --> 47:23.702
The employer, American Radium.

47:23.737 --> 47:26.326
- [Roeder] We can't be undermined by a young girl.

47:27.396 --> 47:29.122
Her name is Bessie Cavallo.

47:36.370 --> 47:37.716
- [Wiley] Hello?

47:37.751 --> 47:41.272
Can you connect me with Mr.Henry Berry, Newark, New Jersey?

47:41.306 --> 47:43.205
- [Operator] Just
a minute, please.

47:46.173 --> 47:48.589
[light music]

47:57.253 --> 47:58.323
- [Josephine Voiceover]
Beautiful as a woman

47:58.358 --> 48:00.463
in her moments in time.

48:00.498 --> 48:02.880
A thousand beads of thought on a white string.

48:04.260 --> 48:06.884
Stones of sunlight
pile up in heaven.

48:08.264 --> 48:09.887
They take the shapes of light.

48:12.165 --> 48:15.340
- Hey, will you help me practice my feeling spaces?

48:16.376 --> 48:17.756
- I'm studying.

48:17.791 --> 48:19.966
- I have to be ready
to be discovered.

48:21.381 --> 48:22.623
Come on, just one round.

48:23.970 --> 48:26.386
- Action, sorrow.

48:30.079 --> 48:31.391
Shock.

48:31.425 --> 48:33.324
Melancholy.

48:33.358 --> 48:36.430
Serenity, revulsion, rage.

48:37.362 --> 48:38.156
Passion.

48:39.295 --> 48:40.779
Ennui.

48:40.814 --> 48:42.126
- En what?

48:42.160 --> 48:42.954
- Ennui.

48:45.301 --> 48:46.406
It's infinite boredom.

48:47.959 --> 48:50.893
[sighing]

48:50.928 --> 48:51.998
- Great, Miss Cavallo.

48:53.137 --> 48:55.208
Producers will be in touch.

48:55.242 --> 48:56.036
- Thank you.

49:09.291 --> 49:11.396
- [Receptionist] Consumer's League, how can I help you?

49:13.398 --> 49:14.986
- I want you all
to meet Mr. Berry.

49:15.021 --> 49:16.470
He's gonna represent you.

49:16.505 --> 49:17.368
- Hello, ladies.

49:17.402 --> 49:19.715
Please call me Henry.

49:19.749 --> 49:21.579
I feel as if I already know you.

49:23.270 --> 49:25.134
- He looks too young
to be a lawyer.

49:26.342 --> 49:27.895
- I just passed
the bar, actually.

49:27.930 --> 49:29.138
But don't worry, I studied

49:29.173 --> 49:31.382
all about workplace
injury at school.

49:36.559 --> 49:40.943
Now, once that we prove
radium is poisonous,

49:40.978 --> 49:43.635
we can win by proving
that American Radium

49:43.670 --> 49:45.465
has known of the
danger for years.

49:46.535 --> 49:48.295
- We can prove that?

49:48.330 --> 49:50.228
- Yes, they did a
study years ago.

49:50.263 --> 49:51.471
The Drinker Report.

49:52.472 --> 49:54.163
- They knew about
this before we did?

49:55.026 --> 49:56.303
- Do we have that report?

49:56.338 --> 49:57.546
- No.

49:57.580 --> 50:00.790
If American Radium paid
for it, they own it.

50:00.825 --> 50:03.172
- Own research?
- That's absurd!

50:03.207 --> 50:04.656
- It's like owning gravity.

50:04.691 --> 50:07.418
- Katherine Drinker isn't even allowed to talk about it.

50:09.385 --> 50:12.319
- Don't worry, three weeks from now, we'll be in court.

50:13.631 --> 50:15.771
And let me just say, as the father of three daughters,

50:15.805 --> 50:17.773
I'm honored to be a
part of your fight.

50:20.914 --> 50:23.572
[dramatic music]

50:29.957 --> 50:30.717
- [Driver] Hey, that's her.

50:30.751 --> 50:31.545
Cavallo girl.

50:33.030 --> 50:35.998
Boss wouldn't mind if we
clipped her, would he?

50:36.033 --> 50:38.725
[engine revving]

50:40.175 --> 50:41.969
That big head
belongs on her knees.

50:42.004 --> 50:43.281
Go, go, go!

50:43.316 --> 50:44.627
- Hey, watch out!

50:44.662 --> 50:48.597
- Get out of the road! - We know where you live!

50:48.631 --> 50:51.324
[lively music]

51:04.440 --> 51:06.649
- [Bessie] Thank you for
coming with me tonight.

51:06.684 --> 51:09.549
- Finally I get to see what all this commie fuss is about.

51:11.137 --> 51:14.071
[people chattering]

51:33.538 --> 51:36.196
- We made it through this year.

51:43.169 --> 51:44.549
Hi!

51:44.584 --> 51:46.862
[laughing]

51:52.868 --> 51:54.835
- Why don't you
guys start, 10...

51:54.870 --> 51:58.218
- [All] Nine, eight, seven, six,

51:58.253 --> 52:00.427
five, four, three, two, one!

52:03.050 --> 52:04.259
Happy new year!

52:05.191 --> 52:07.986
[people cheering]

52:09.954 --> 52:12.750
- Happy new year.
- Happy new year.

52:12.784 --> 52:14.234
- Happy new year.

52:15.373 --> 52:17.375
- Hey, no more for
you, no more for you.

52:17.410 --> 52:21.276
- Hey, hey, hey, you
know you like that.

52:21.310 --> 52:23.001
- Everybody, comerades!

52:23.036 --> 52:24.417
- Speech!
- Speech!

52:26.143 --> 52:28.386
[laughing]

52:29.698 --> 52:34.496
- This year, I wanted
to leave the smog

52:34.530 --> 52:37.602
to be discovered
and go to Hollywood.

52:37.637 --> 52:39.086
- Never to be seen again.

52:39.121 --> 52:40.295
[laughing]

52:40.329 --> 52:43.021
- Never to be seen again!

52:43.056 --> 52:48.061
But, instead, I saw America for the first time.

52:49.925 --> 52:51.168
I saw it evil.

52:53.653 --> 52:56.138
But you all taught me so much.

52:59.314 --> 53:02.834
I am going to make
American Radium

53:02.869 --> 53:04.284
pay for what they've done.

53:04.319 --> 53:06.217
- Tell 'em Bessie! - Yeah, and we'll be heard!

53:06.252 --> 53:07.425
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

53:09.220 --> 53:10.290
[door crashing]

53:10.325 --> 53:11.360
- On the ground, commies!

53:11.395 --> 53:12.361
[people shouting]

53:12.396 --> 53:13.120
- Get Jo!

53:13.155 --> 53:14.156
Get Jo out of here right now!

53:14.191 --> 53:16.020
- Come on, Jo.

53:16.054 --> 53:17.366
Let's go, Bessie!

53:17.401 --> 53:19.575
- I'm exercising my right to peaceful assembly!

53:19.610 --> 53:21.301
- Let's go.

53:21.336 --> 53:23.338
- Come on, we have to go! - Etta!

53:23.372 --> 53:24.960
- I said get down!

53:24.994 --> 53:27.376
[people shouting]

53:27.411 --> 53:30.241
- Etta, Etta!
- Commie scum!

53:30.276 --> 53:31.932
- No!

53:31.967 --> 53:34.314
- We have a right to be here!

53:34.349 --> 53:35.591
I'm sorry.

53:35.626 --> 53:37.938
- Miss Cavallo,
you're under arrest.

53:41.045 --> 53:42.702
- How does he know your name?

53:45.360 --> 53:46.361
Dammit Bess!

53:47.983 --> 53:48.984
- I'm sorry.

53:50.606 --> 53:53.506
[shutter clicking]

53:55.232 --> 53:57.717
[somber music]

54:02.825 --> 54:04.379
- Everything's falling apart.

54:08.279 --> 54:09.315
I'm so sorry.

54:11.006 --> 54:12.594
I didn't know they
could do that.

54:14.734 --> 54:16.460
- They can do
anything they want.

54:18.220 --> 54:22.155
That's why we have to make surewe capture our side of this.

54:27.747 --> 54:29.714
- Where did you learn
to use a camera?

54:33.131 --> 54:35.617
- My family owned a
photo studio in Tulsa.

54:37.377 --> 54:38.378
Oklahoma.

54:40.138 --> 54:41.001
Grew up with it.

54:42.382 --> 54:43.832
- Why did you leave Oklahoma?

54:45.351 --> 54:46.213
- Um...

54:47.318 --> 54:48.768
'Bout six and a half years ago,

54:50.701 --> 54:53.497
the police and all the deputies,

54:53.531 --> 54:55.361
they burnt down the
whole neighborhood.

54:58.985 --> 55:01.228
They said a black boy
attacked a white girl.

55:02.195 --> 55:03.161
- Oh my God.

55:06.164 --> 55:08.235
Can't the government
do something?

55:09.444 --> 55:11.998
- Great War planes flew overhead, dropping firebombs.

55:14.449 --> 55:15.381
- What do you mean?

55:17.728 --> 55:19.626
- It was the government, Bess.

55:21.007 --> 55:23.320
More than a thousand
of our homes destroyed.

55:25.391 --> 55:28.117
- Why is there so much
wrong in the world

55:28.152 --> 55:29.533
that no one knows about?

55:34.296 --> 55:37.472
- It's easier to believe stories

55:37.506 --> 55:38.921
that make us feel safe.

55:42.546 --> 55:44.410
- I don't feel very
safe right now.

55:46.412 --> 55:48.759
What if no one believes us?

55:50.519 --> 55:53.453
What if they believe
American Radium?

55:53.488 --> 55:55.041
- Don't give them a choice.

55:59.425 --> 56:02.151
Is there anyone on the inside's got nothing to lose?

56:07.743 --> 56:10.436
[somber music]

56:16.373 --> 56:18.202
[baton rattling]

56:18.236 --> 56:19.479
- [Cop] Your charges
didn't stick.

56:19.514 --> 56:21.136
You're free to go.

56:36.254 --> 56:39.257
- Be safe, Etta.
- You be safe, too.

57:06.215 --> 57:07.251
- Can I come in?

57:10.979 --> 57:13.533
How's your bath?

57:13.568 --> 57:14.431
- Not in the mood.

57:18.573 --> 57:19.401
- You okay?

57:23.232 --> 57:25.511
- If I didn't have
to look out for you,

57:25.545 --> 57:26.822
and all the stupid
things you do,

57:26.857 --> 57:28.824
I don't think I could
keep going with this.

57:30.585 --> 57:32.310
- What are you talking
about, the lawsuit?

57:32.345 --> 57:34.520
- No, this.

57:35.935 --> 57:38.040
This slow motion death sentence.

57:39.525 --> 57:41.250
Why not get it over with?

57:41.285 --> 57:42.528
- Stop, you're scaring me.

57:42.562 --> 57:44.978
- You scare me when your
head is in the clouds.

57:46.117 --> 57:47.981
When you yell at
police officers.

57:49.742 --> 57:51.778
What's gonna happen
to you when I'm gone?

57:53.815 --> 57:55.161
- Jo, get out of the tub.

57:57.991 --> 57:59.579
- We have to sell
back the radio.

58:01.339 --> 58:02.444
- That doesn't matter.

58:12.834 --> 58:13.628
I'm sorry.

58:14.801 --> 58:15.837
- It's okay.

58:20.773 --> 58:23.396
[light music]

58:57.292 --> 59:00.364
- Jo, will you be
ready in five minutes?

59:00.398 --> 59:02.953
I don't want to be late for our first day of court.

59:08.372 --> 59:09.373
- Ow!

59:10.719 --> 59:12.928
[gasping]

59:27.322 --> 59:28.288
A piece of my jaw fell out.

59:28.323 --> 59:29.289
- Jo!

59:29.324 --> 59:30.118
No, no!

59:30.152 --> 59:31.671
Josephine, come on.

59:31.706 --> 59:33.190
Come on, come here.

59:33.224 --> 59:35.330
We gotta get you changed before court, you have blood--

59:35.364 --> 59:37.194
I'm gonna go get
her some clothes.

59:37.228 --> 59:38.264
- She's not going!

59:39.955 --> 59:40.818
- What, why?

59:40.853 --> 59:42.406
- We're going to the hospital.

59:42.440 --> 59:44.719
Are you coming?

59:44.753 --> 59:46.755
- But we have to be there.

59:46.790 --> 59:48.343
We have to.

59:48.377 --> 59:50.069
- She's your only sister!

59:51.657 --> 59:53.348
- That's why we're doing this!

59:54.694 --> 59:57.732
- It's your choice. - Just let Bessie go to court.

59:57.766 --> 01:00:00.182
- Jo! - It's okay, I'll be fine.

01:00:01.218 --> 01:00:02.219
- [Grandpa] Come on.

01:00:04.497 --> 01:00:06.292
- I'll come as soon as I can.

01:00:09.191 --> 01:00:09.985
Jo...

01:00:22.101 --> 01:00:24.551
[dramatic music]

01:00:24.586 --> 01:00:26.346
- [Reporter] The trial
of the Radium Girls

01:00:26.381 --> 01:00:29.349
versus American
Radium begins today.

01:00:29.384 --> 01:00:31.420
Although several dial painters on the east coast

01:00:31.455 --> 01:00:34.423
have reportedly died
suspicious deaths,

01:00:34.458 --> 01:00:37.323
the cause of their illness is still widely disputed.

01:00:58.068 --> 01:01:00.553
- Dip, lick, paint.

01:01:02.279 --> 01:01:06.283
Dip, lick, paint.

01:01:08.423 --> 01:01:10.701
Dip, lick, paint.

01:01:12.565 --> 01:01:14.636
Repeat, repeat, repeat.

01:01:16.396 --> 01:01:17.984
One penny per face.

01:01:23.956 --> 01:01:25.336
Now look at my face.

01:01:26.993 --> 01:01:28.339
[gavel banging]

01:01:28.374 --> 01:01:30.100
- My knee aches something awful.

01:01:32.102 --> 01:01:35.346
No one believed me until
I was holding my son,

01:01:35.381 --> 01:01:36.451
and it just gave out.

01:01:39.316 --> 01:01:41.007
Next thing I know, I'm
at the doctor's office

01:01:41.042 --> 01:01:42.388
having a cast put on.

01:01:43.251 --> 01:01:44.321
[gavel banging]

01:01:44.355 --> 01:01:45.805
- One time I asked if the paint

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:47.911
could be why I was breaking out.

01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:53.399
And Mrs. Butkiss
ate a whole mouthful

01:01:53.433 --> 01:01:56.367
of Undark off the spatula to show us it was safe.

01:02:01.407 --> 01:02:03.340
She said it would put
a glow in my cheeks.

01:02:05.445 --> 01:02:08.172
[gavel banging]

01:02:09.035 --> 01:02:10.243
- [Paula] This is awful.

01:02:14.282 --> 01:02:17.009
[dramatic music]

01:02:17.043 --> 01:02:21.358
- The autopsy results wereconfirmed by three laboratories.

01:02:21.392 --> 01:02:24.257
The bones of the already
deceased dial painters

01:02:24.292 --> 01:02:28.503
are radioactive, and will be for another thousand years.

01:02:30.919 --> 01:02:34.716
There's no doubt in my mind that chronic exposure

01:02:35.890 --> 01:02:38.271
to radium caused the
death of Mary Cavallo,

01:02:38.306 --> 01:02:41.585
and is killing the
women before you now.

01:02:41.619 --> 01:02:44.277
On average, they have less than one year to live.

01:03:01.294 --> 01:03:04.642
Radium poisoning has
ravaged their bodies.

01:03:11.684 --> 01:03:14.687
- Radium will certainly deliver its victim to death

01:03:14.721 --> 01:03:16.206
sooner or later.

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.691
- [Miriam] But they're still saying it's harmless.

01:03:18.725 --> 01:03:21.314
- Well, Clara can barely walk

01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:23.834
and Ruth's jaw is blown
up like a balloon.

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:26.664
- I'm scared.

01:03:27.665 --> 01:03:29.150
- What's gonna happen to us?

01:03:30.254 --> 01:03:32.015
- I dunno.

01:03:32.049 --> 01:03:33.775
My husband thinks
it's all made up.

01:03:35.259 --> 01:03:37.952
[horn blaring]

01:03:40.989 --> 01:03:45.891
- I dunno about you, but I'm not going back in there.

01:03:45.925 --> 01:03:50.930
- I don't want to
get in trouble.

01:04:07.602 --> 01:04:09.466
[glass smashing]

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.399

[cackling]

01:04:16.335 --> 01:04:17.681
- What's happened?

01:04:17.715 --> 01:04:19.165
- How could anybody do this?

01:04:23.169 --> 01:04:25.275
- [Josephine] I don't know.

01:04:26.897 --> 01:04:28.588
- How can anyone
hate us this much?

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:35.250
- [Reporter] The Consumer's League, led by Katherine Wiley

01:04:35.285 --> 01:04:37.943
has the ear of Walter
Litman, editor of one

01:04:37.977 --> 01:04:40.635
of the most powerful
newspapers in New York.

01:04:40.669 --> 01:04:43.465
The million dollar question becomes did the corporation

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:46.330
knowingly expose their
workers to the toxins?

01:04:48.332 --> 01:04:51.232
Social reformer and scientist Dr. Alice Hamilton

01:04:51.266 --> 01:04:53.820
has publicly attacked the lucrative radium industry.

01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:57.894
- [Alice Voiceover]
My dear Katherine,

01:04:57.928 --> 01:04:59.274
as your Harvard colleague,

01:04:59.309 --> 01:05:01.311
I must let you know that the New Jersey Department of Labor

01:05:01.345 --> 01:05:03.485
has a copy of your report.

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:06.868
It shows that every girl
is in perfect health.

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:08.939
How can Arthur Roeder
do such a thing?

01:05:08.974 --> 01:05:10.837
He forged a report in your name.

01:05:12.011 --> 01:05:14.358
Some action must be taken.

01:05:14.393 --> 01:05:17.120
Most sincerely, Alice Hamilton.

01:05:23.954 --> 01:05:26.681
- I have examined the women you see before you.

01:05:26.715 --> 01:05:29.132
I have examined their coworkers.

01:05:29.166 --> 01:05:32.480
They suffer from
syphilis, nothing more.

01:05:34.861 --> 01:05:38.279
Radium poisoning is an invention

01:05:38.313 --> 01:05:41.868
of fame-hungry doctors
itching for a discovery.

01:05:46.977 --> 01:05:49.566
- Do you have a license to practice medicine, Mr. Flint?

01:05:51.361 --> 01:05:55.365
- As a professor at Columbia University, and a physiologist

01:05:55.399 --> 01:05:57.574
with the United States
Public Health Service,

01:05:57.608 --> 01:05:58.747
I hold a doctorate--

01:05:58.782 --> 01:06:01.095
- Are you a medical doctor, sir?

01:06:01.129 --> 01:06:02.544
[sighing]

01:06:02.579 --> 01:06:04.477
- As I was saying,
I hold a doctorate--

01:06:04.512 --> 01:06:07.687
- Are you a medical doctor, yes or no, Mr. Flint?

01:06:12.347 --> 01:06:13.141
- No.

01:06:15.212 --> 01:06:16.351
- And yet, you performed

01:06:16.386 --> 01:06:18.457
medical examinations
on the plaintiffs?

01:06:18.491 --> 01:06:19.285
- Yes.

01:06:21.287 --> 01:06:22.357
[gavel banging]

01:06:22.392 --> 01:06:25.257
- Mr. Roeder, were you
aware that Dr. Flint

01:06:25.291 --> 01:06:26.913
was not a licensed physician?

01:06:28.639 --> 01:06:29.433
- I'm sorry?

01:06:30.848 --> 01:06:33.230
- Can you read the question back to Mr. Roeder?

01:06:33.265 --> 01:06:35.129
- "Were you aware that Dr. Flint

01:06:35.163 --> 01:06:37.234
"was not a licensed physician?"

01:06:38.511 --> 01:06:40.617
- I assure you, Dr. Flint

01:06:40.651 --> 01:06:43.137
is a scientist of
the highest caliber.

01:06:43.171 --> 01:06:45.484
- Did you pay Dr. Flint to diagnose the plaintiffs

01:06:45.518 --> 01:06:48.866
with syphilis in order to smear their reputations?

01:06:48.901 --> 01:06:49.695
- No.

01:06:51.283 --> 01:06:53.147
- When did you
first become aware

01:06:53.181 --> 01:06:54.976
of the consequences of radium?

01:06:57.289 --> 01:07:00.257
- These deaths are tragic.

01:07:00.292 --> 01:07:03.640
But let's be clear, Mr. Berry,

01:07:03.674 --> 01:07:05.883
there are many
competing theories--

01:07:05.918 --> 01:07:08.679
- Mr. Roeder, did you commissiona study of the radium paint

01:07:08.714 --> 01:07:11.337
two years before the
death of Mary Cavallo?

01:07:11.372 --> 01:07:13.063
- I did.

01:07:13.098 --> 01:07:15.376
The Drinker Report
showed nothing amiss.

01:07:16.687 --> 01:07:18.310
People are so quick
to jump on things

01:07:18.344 --> 01:07:20.726
that they just don't understand.

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:23.867
But the fact is,
this radium energy

01:07:23.901 --> 01:07:26.766
is one of the most
vital therapeutic agents

01:07:26.801 --> 01:07:28.078
we have at our command.

01:07:28.113 --> 01:07:30.529
Even if there were
harmful effects,

01:07:30.563 --> 01:07:34.050
American Radium cannot beblamed for scientific progress.

01:07:39.503 --> 01:07:42.679
- Arthur Roeder, president of American Radium,

01:07:42.713 --> 01:07:47.649
maintains that the women suffer from Menierial disease.

01:07:47.684 --> 01:07:48.719
- I don't believe it.

01:07:49.996 --> 01:07:50.997
How dare he?

01:07:52.482 --> 01:07:55.071
[tense music]

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:28.207
- You're trespassing.

01:08:32.349 --> 01:08:33.729
- I'm here to see Leech.

01:08:35.939 --> 01:08:37.285
- He's been out for weeks.

01:08:44.774 --> 01:08:45.568
- Where is he?

01:08:48.883 --> 01:08:51.091
Mrs. Butkiss, please!

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:52.541
I need to find him.

01:08:54.371 --> 01:08:57.202
Please, I will never ask
you for anything again.

01:08:57.236 --> 01:09:01.895
- [laughs] Oh, you were always one for melodrama.

01:09:13.252 --> 01:09:14.874
He's at St. Francis.

01:09:19.327 --> 01:09:21.328
We'll all be in the end.

01:09:26.609 --> 01:09:27.611
- Thank you.

01:09:28.957 --> 01:09:31.615
[dramatic music]

01:10:12.967 --> 01:10:15.349
[gasping]

01:10:15.383 --> 01:10:17.282
- It's nice of you to visit.

01:10:17.316 --> 01:10:18.662
None of the other girls have.

01:10:22.321 --> 01:10:23.253
- Will you help us?

01:10:27.119 --> 01:10:29.259
- If a dying man
could be of help.

01:10:32.366 --> 01:10:34.402
- I found something
that Mary wrote.

01:10:36.749 --> 01:10:40.236
It said you warned her.

01:10:43.411 --> 01:10:45.032
- Yes, I remember.

01:10:47.933 --> 01:10:49.693
- You knew it was dangerous?

01:10:52.317 --> 01:10:53.179
- Yes.

01:10:55.353 --> 01:10:59.047
- Did Arthur Roeder?
- Yes.

01:11:02.119 --> 01:11:07.090
- Years ago, we hired a team of Harvard scientists.

01:11:07.952 --> 01:11:11.267
A married couple, the Drinkers.

01:11:12.647 --> 01:11:14.546
They were the ones
who first told us.

01:11:16.202 --> 01:11:17.169
- Years ago.

01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:19.447
Years.

01:11:23.175 --> 01:11:24.590
Why didn't you tell us?

01:11:26.385 --> 01:11:29.423
- I don't know, I was scared.

01:11:29.457 --> 01:11:30.803
I didn't know what to do.

01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:37.362
The business got bigger
than I ever imagined.

01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:42.228
I invented Undark.

01:11:44.472 --> 01:11:47.371
That snake took it
all away from me.

01:11:49.581 --> 01:11:50.375
- Arthur Roeder?

01:11:51.755 --> 01:11:53.516
- Never trust a money man.

01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:56.621
Never have a partner.

01:12:00.281 --> 01:12:03.526
- Help me take
American Radium down.

01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:06.839
- [Leech] No.

01:12:06.874 --> 01:12:08.702
You must be careful.

01:12:08.737 --> 01:12:10.255
- Please, Walter!

01:12:14.053 --> 01:12:14.778
Please.

01:12:18.541 --> 01:12:20.163
We exhumed Mary.

01:12:22.061 --> 01:12:26.342
She died from radium poisoning, just like you are.

01:12:31.105 --> 01:12:32.002
- You'll never win.

01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:35.868
- I'm doing it, no matter what.

01:12:39.803 --> 01:12:41.736
If you loved her, please!

01:12:44.981 --> 01:12:47.362
[light music]

01:12:50.710 --> 01:12:51.815
- Okay, okay.

01:12:55.785 --> 01:12:57.338
I'll do it, Bessie.

01:12:58.374 --> 01:12:59.166
- Okay.

01:13:06.312 --> 01:13:08.280
Leech says that
he'll tell the truth,

01:13:08.314 --> 01:13:11.663
that American Radium forcedthose scientists to keep quiet.

01:13:11.697 --> 01:13:12.835
They knew that it was toxic,

01:13:12.871 --> 01:13:14.700
and they told us it was safe.

01:13:14.735 --> 01:13:18.117
- Bessie, this is huge!
- They knew.

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:32.269
- [Judge] You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth

01:13:32.304 --> 01:13:35.100
and nothing but the
truth, so help you God?

01:13:35.134 --> 01:13:35.928
- I do.

01:13:50.425 --> 01:13:51.219
- Your name?

01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:54.706
- Bessie Patricia Cavallo.

01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:57.294
- And when did you begin working at American Radium?

01:13:58.606 --> 01:14:00.263
- Three years ago,

01:14:00.297 --> 01:14:04.681
after my sister
Mary passed away.

01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:07.684
My other sister, Josephine,

01:14:07.719 --> 01:14:10.653
had already worked
there for two years.

01:14:10.687 --> 01:14:12.378
- And where is Josephine today?

01:14:13.725 --> 01:14:18.419
- She is recovering from
bone removal surgery

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:20.490
due to radium necrosis.

01:14:20.525 --> 01:14:22.458
[jury mumbling]

01:14:22.492 --> 01:14:23.355
- Objection!

01:14:23.389 --> 01:14:24.874
- Your Honor, radium necrosis

01:14:24.907 --> 01:14:27.532
is the hospital's officialdiagnosis of Josephine Cavallo.

01:14:29.534 --> 01:14:31.294
- I'll allow it.
- But your Honor--

01:14:31.327 --> 01:14:32.088
- Overruled!

01:14:37.507 --> 01:14:39.509
- During your time
at American Radium,

01:14:39.544 --> 01:14:41.235
were you ever made aware

01:14:41.269 --> 01:14:44.376
of the dangerous
nature of radium paint?

01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:45.481
- No.

01:14:45.514 --> 01:14:47.309
- [Berry] When did
you learn the truth?

01:14:48.207 --> 01:14:49.485
- When we autopsied Mary.

01:14:51.210 --> 01:14:53.661
But the former president
of American Radium

01:14:53.696 --> 01:14:58.148
and the inventor of
the paint, Mr. Leech,

01:14:59.391 --> 01:15:01.737
warned Mary a long time ago.

01:15:03.014 --> 01:15:04.741
I read about it in her diary.

01:15:04.776 --> 01:15:06.743
- Your Honor, we
submit the diary

01:15:06.778 --> 01:15:09.090
of Mary Cavallo as evidence.

01:15:09.125 --> 01:15:10.126
- Objection.

01:15:11.023 --> 01:15:12.266
A teenage girl's diary

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.199
is hardly reliable
evidence, your Honor.

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:17.754
- I'll allow it.

01:15:24.036 --> 01:15:26.314
- What did you do when
you read this, Bessie?

01:15:27.281 --> 01:15:29.282
- I asked Mr. Leech
if it was true.

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:33.494
He said yes.

01:15:33.529 --> 01:15:36.083
[jury muttering]

01:15:36.117 --> 01:15:38.154
He warned Mary.

01:15:38.188 --> 01:15:40.984
American Radium knew
that it was dangerous

01:15:42.607 --> 01:15:44.746
years before she died.

01:15:44.781 --> 01:15:47.577
[jury chattering]

01:15:49.924 --> 01:15:51.201
- I have nothing further.

01:16:01.315 --> 01:16:05.871
- Can you prove these outrageousallegations, Miss Cavallo?

01:16:10.635 --> 01:16:11.773
- No, I can't.

01:16:14.949 --> 01:16:16.710
But Mr. Leech can.

01:16:16.744 --> 01:16:19.436
[jury muttering]

01:16:25.235 --> 01:16:27.617
- Cavallo, how did you get Arthur Leech to testify?

01:16:27.652 --> 01:16:29.032
- [Reporter] Miss Cavallo, what about your fellow workers

01:16:29.067 --> 01:16:30.032
who will lose their jobs?

01:16:30.068 --> 01:16:31.068
- [Reporter] Do you really think

01:16:31.103 --> 01:16:32.621
you can beat American Radium?

01:16:32.657 --> 01:16:34.486
- Radium Girls, 50 dollars

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:37.316
for exclusive access
to your story.

01:16:37.351 --> 01:16:40.043
You'll be the face of the New Jersey Evening Star.

01:16:40.077 --> 01:16:43.288
- Hey, my sister needs
this factory job!

01:16:43.322 --> 01:16:44.289
Don't shut it down.

01:16:46.394 --> 01:16:47.809
- I'm doing a piece.

01:16:47.844 --> 01:16:50.088
Tell me, how do you
prepare for death?

01:16:52.952 --> 01:16:54.851
- I don't think about it much.

01:16:54.886 --> 01:16:57.853
I haven't had the time.

01:16:57.889 --> 01:17:01.893
- If it were up to me, I would charge them with murder.

01:17:06.344 --> 01:17:07.657
- [Reporter] Miss
Cavallo, how do you feel

01:17:07.692 --> 01:17:10.660
about American Radium
covering up the truth?

01:17:10.695 --> 01:17:11.868
- [Reporter] Miss Cavallo, how does it feel

01:17:11.903 --> 01:17:13.352
to be leading the way?

01:17:14.594 --> 01:17:17.322
[dramatic music]

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:23.535
- Listen, listen.

01:17:23.568 --> 01:17:27.125
"Public outcry on behalf
of the Radium Girls.

01:17:27.159 --> 01:17:29.403
"Marie Curie, the scientist who discovered radium,

01:17:29.437 --> 01:17:31.992
"has commented on
their tragic fate.

01:17:32.026 --> 01:17:34.995
"Curie says there is no way to remove the substance

01:17:35.029 --> 01:17:37.722
"from a human body
once it has entered."

01:17:39.171 --> 01:17:43.693
- [Josephine] What on earth are we supposed to do?

01:17:43.728 --> 01:17:46.454
- "Dear Radium Girls,
I am your same age

01:17:46.489 --> 01:17:49.941
"at school in Paris, and I read about you in the papers.

01:17:51.114 --> 01:17:54.221

I got from the Lord.

"You are in my prayers,
sincerely, Martin."

01:17:59.467 --> 01:18:00.572
Here, close your eyes.

01:18:05.957 --> 01:18:07.165
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:18:10.133 --> 01:18:11.548
Here, I'll get it.

01:18:15.344 --> 01:18:18.279
- I bet you could score
a fancy audition now.

01:18:20.281 --> 01:18:21.386
- I wouldn't take it.

01:18:23.802 --> 01:18:25.735
- I'll give you a
million dollars, kid.

01:18:28.117 --> 01:18:28.945
What do you say?

01:18:31.223 --> 01:18:33.709
- Why, thank you sir, but...

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:36.366
I wouldn't do it for a billion.

01:18:38.368 --> 01:18:39.715
- What about a trillion?

01:18:41.302 --> 01:18:42.994
- No, not even that.

01:18:43.028 --> 01:18:44.340
Is that crazy?

01:18:46.307 --> 01:18:48.068
Well, maybe a trillion.

01:18:56.352 --> 01:18:57.146
We're gonna win.

01:19:02.358 --> 01:19:04.947

[phone ringing]

01:19:25.415 --> 01:19:26.416
- Hello?

01:19:27.383 --> 01:19:28.452
- [Butkiss] This is Anne Butkiss

01:19:28.487 --> 01:19:30.489
from the American
Radium factory.

01:19:30.523 --> 01:19:33.353
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

01:19:46.091 --> 01:19:49.094
[people chattering]

01:19:51.269 --> 01:19:54.065
[gavel banging]

01:19:57.068 --> 01:19:59.621
- [Judge] Walter Leech, do you swear to tell the truth,

01:19:59.656 --> 01:20:02.659
the whole truth, and nothingbut the truth, so help you God?

01:20:04.385 --> 01:20:05.386
- I do.

01:20:12.877 --> 01:20:15.189
[coughing]

01:20:16.156 --> 01:20:17.329
- [Berry] How long
have you been aware

01:20:17.364 --> 01:20:18.848
of the dangers of radium?

01:20:21.886 --> 01:20:26.373
- I always believed it to be a great medical good.

01:20:26.407 --> 01:20:30.308
That's why I invested in radium mines 20 years ago.

01:20:32.068 --> 01:20:34.588
- [Berry] And how were you acquainted with Mary Cavallo

01:20:34.621 --> 01:20:36.486
in the years leading
up to her death?

01:20:42.077 --> 01:20:44.148
- She was, um...

01:20:46.358 --> 01:20:49.258
She was one dial
painter among hundreds.

01:20:52.226 --> 01:20:55.816
The rumor was she had syphilis.

01:20:55.851 --> 01:20:57.887
Apparently she had
quite the reputation.

01:21:02.236 --> 01:21:03.341
- [Berry] Did you ever warn her

01:21:03.375 --> 01:21:05.308
against ingesting
the radium paint?

01:21:07.517 --> 01:21:12.315
- Well, at one time I
did warn a girl or two

01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:14.870
against licking the brushes.

01:21:17.803 --> 01:21:21.428
You see, the human mouth is teeming with bacteria.

01:21:21.462 --> 01:21:26.467
Licking unclean brushes
is unsanitary behavior.

01:21:27.779 --> 01:21:30.713
- Unsanitary? - That's right, Mr. Berry.

01:21:31.610 --> 01:21:33.164
- Unsanitary.

01:21:33.198 --> 01:21:35.304
[jury muttering]

01:21:35.338 --> 01:21:36.684
- [Berry] I have nothing else.

01:21:37.927 --> 01:21:39.480
- [Judge] Order, order please!

01:21:44.416 --> 01:21:46.452
- You are suffering
from the same

01:21:46.487 --> 01:21:50.215
supposed radium poisoning yourself, are you not?

01:21:50.250 --> 01:21:51.044
- I am.

01:21:52.286 --> 01:21:54.495
- If you had been
aware of the danger,

01:21:54.530 --> 01:21:56.739
wouldn't you have been
able to save yourself?

01:21:58.361 --> 01:21:59.707
- That's correct.

01:21:59.742 --> 01:22:02.434
[jury muttering]

01:22:07.474 --> 01:22:09.027
- [Judge] Order
in the courtroom!

01:22:09.062 --> 01:22:11.650
[gavel banging]

01:22:13.929 --> 01:22:16.309
[sobbing]

01:22:16.344 --> 01:22:19.244
- Mr. Berry, I'm
Katherine Drinker.

01:22:23.421 --> 01:22:25.423
[sobbing]

01:22:33.568 --> 01:22:35.812
- Bessie, I think you're brave.

01:22:37.159 --> 01:22:39.644
[somber music]

01:22:55.798 --> 01:22:58.697
[gavel banging]

01:22:58.732 --> 01:23:03.530
- [Judge] Will you be calling another witness, Mr. Berry?

01:23:03.564 --> 01:23:06.257
- We call Dr. Katherine Drinker of Harvard University.

01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:23.343
Will you state your name and occupation for the record?

01:23:23.377 --> 01:23:25.241
- Dr. Katherine Drinker.

01:23:25.276 --> 01:23:28.279
I'm a professor at the Harvard School of Industrial Hygiene.

01:23:28.313 --> 01:23:30.487
- Dr. Drinker, can
you tell the court

01:23:30.522 --> 01:23:34.594
when you first becameacquainted with American Radium?

01:23:34.630 --> 01:23:38.013
- Four years ago, American Radium hired my team

01:23:38.047 --> 01:23:41.740
to investigate whether their radium paint could be harmful.

01:23:41.775 --> 01:23:43.018
- What were your results?

01:23:45.227 --> 01:23:47.815
- The workers were all luminous.

01:23:47.850 --> 01:23:52.855
Their hair, faces, hands, arms, necks, dresses,

01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:56.410
underclothes, even
their corsets glowed.

01:23:59.137 --> 01:24:01.380
Of the 22 employees we examined,

01:24:02.313 --> 01:24:04.349
none had normal blood levels.

01:24:05.592 --> 01:24:07.628
We found the trouble
due to radium,

01:24:07.663 --> 01:24:10.252
and recommended
precautions to take.

01:24:10.286 --> 01:24:13.255
- And what did American Radium do with this information?

01:24:14.290 --> 01:24:16.361
- They found our
results tentative

01:24:16.396 --> 01:24:18.121
and maintained there
was nothing harmful

01:24:18.156 --> 01:24:19.261
anywhere in the works.

01:24:20.193 --> 01:24:21.332
- [Berry] Do you stand
by your findings?

01:24:21.366 --> 01:24:22.919
- [Drinker] Of course.

01:24:22.954 --> 01:24:24.300
- [Berry] Then why didn't you publish the study?

01:24:24.335 --> 01:24:25.163
- We wanted to.

01:24:26.406 --> 01:24:30.582
American Radium found thestudy too sensitive to release.

01:24:30.617 --> 01:24:31.583
They would sue us

01:24:33.137 --> 01:24:36.380
and cut off their support to our university if we did.

01:24:36.416 --> 01:24:39.143
[jury muttering]

01:24:40.385 --> 01:24:43.802
However, listening to testimony this past week...

01:24:50.809 --> 01:24:52.327
I could not stand by once again.

01:24:53.571 --> 01:24:55.366
- Thank you, I have
nothing further.

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:58.403
[jury chattering]

01:25:07.067 --> 01:25:10.864
- Um, permission to
approach the bench?

01:25:10.898 --> 01:25:11.692
- I'll allow it.

01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:19.355
- Your Honor... [mumbling]

01:25:25.499 --> 01:25:26.638
- [Berry] Your Honor,
that's not fair.

01:25:26.673 --> 01:25:28.261
- Mind your tone, counselor.

01:25:37.097 --> 01:25:38.857
[gavel banging]

01:25:38.892 --> 01:25:43.103
- American Radium has requesteda recess for 18 weeks.

01:25:43.138 --> 01:25:46.348
A key witness to the
defense is abroad.

01:25:47.625 --> 01:25:49.489
- The bank is coming
after our house.

01:25:49.523 --> 01:25:52.318
- Henry, how is this legal?

01:25:52.353 --> 01:25:54.735
- The recess is granted and we'll reconvene then.

01:25:54.770 --> 01:25:55.771
Court is dismissed.

01:25:55.805 --> 01:25:56.565
[gavel banging]

01:25:56.599 --> 01:25:58.394
[jury chattering]

01:25:58.429 --> 01:26:00.465
- We're running out of time. - We'll fight it.

01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:01.742
- How?

01:26:01.777 --> 01:26:02.778
- In the court of
public opinion.

01:26:04.434 --> 01:26:06.851
[light music]

01:26:09.681 --> 01:26:11.096
[phone ringing]

01:26:11.130 --> 01:26:12.028
- [Radio Host] The
nation has rallied

01:26:12.063 --> 01:26:13.651
in support of the Radium Girls

01:26:13.684 --> 01:26:16.481
in the wake of the postponement of their case.

01:26:16.516 --> 01:26:18.966
Arthur Roeder has resigned amidst controversy

01:26:19.001 --> 01:26:22.177
as other dial painters from Illinois to Connecticut

01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:24.213
are now coming forward.

01:26:24.248 --> 01:26:26.284
- [Supporter] Dear sisters, the New Jersey League

01:26:26.318 --> 01:26:28.873
of Women Voters is working to set a legal precedent

01:26:28.907 --> 01:26:31.496
for radium toxicity,
because of you.

01:26:32.739 --> 01:26:34.291
- [Dial Painter] Did you
know everyone in Ottowa

01:26:34.327 --> 01:26:35.914
is talking about your case?

01:26:35.949 --> 01:26:37.744
- [Supporter] My
dearest Miss Cavallos...

01:26:37.778 --> 01:26:39.608
- [Dial Painter] We are
dial painters like you.

01:26:39.642 --> 01:26:42.231
- [Dial Painter] I was
only 15 at the time.

01:26:42.266 --> 01:26:43.922
Dial painting paid very well.

01:26:43.957 --> 01:26:46.684
- [Dial Painter] I myself have had 19 operations.

01:26:47.892 --> 01:26:49.237
- [Dial Painter] I was
put in a steel cast

01:26:49.273 --> 01:26:51.171
from my chest to my knees.

01:26:53.103 --> 01:26:55.727
My doctor said the radium honeycombed my jaw bone.

01:26:55.762 --> 01:26:56.934
- [Dial Painter] One of my legs

01:26:56.969 --> 01:26:58.246
is now shorter than the other.

01:26:58.282 --> 01:27:00.732
- [Dial Painter]
We had big dreams.

01:27:00.767 --> 01:27:03.701
- [Dial Painter] Thank you for standing up for us.

01:27:03.735 --> 01:27:05.978
- [Amelia] Yours in
fighting spirit, Amelia.

01:27:10.294 --> 01:27:12.986
[dramatic music]

01:27:45.329 --> 01:27:46.330
- Mary, is that you?

01:27:49.471 --> 01:27:50.264
- No.

01:27:53.302 --> 01:27:55.442
- Leave, spirit!

01:28:09.559 --> 01:28:10.768
- Why did you do it?

01:28:13.011 --> 01:28:14.184
- My sister...

01:28:16.118 --> 01:28:17.740
She was dying of cancer.

01:28:17.775 --> 01:28:21.882
Radium was the miracle cure.

01:28:24.402 --> 01:28:26.197
- What?

01:28:26.231 --> 01:28:27.302
- But I was too late.

01:28:30.615 --> 01:28:31.892
I'm always too late.

01:28:34.447 --> 01:28:39.452
But American Radium will take care of her children

01:28:41.039 --> 01:28:44.457
for the rest of their lives, and their children's lives.

01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:48.668
- She loved you!

01:28:51.532 --> 01:28:52.637
- Forgive me, Mary.

01:28:57.090 --> 01:29:00.714
- Maat, will you break
the power of Satan

01:29:01.888 --> 01:29:04.925
from his assignments
in Walter Leech's life?

01:29:09.413 --> 01:29:12.139
The goddess of
truth is watching.

01:29:22.184 --> 01:29:24.496
Our bones will glow
forever, you know.

01:29:26.913 --> 01:29:28.121
- Yes, I know.

01:29:36.647 --> 01:29:38.130
Goodbye, sisters.

01:29:42.273 --> 01:29:44.862
[light music]

01:30:00.671 --> 01:30:02.431
[knocking]

01:30:02.466 --> 01:30:04.295
- Delivery.
- Hey Walt.

01:30:04.329 --> 01:30:07.228
- The postmark says California.

01:30:07.263 --> 01:30:09.093
- California!

01:30:09.127 --> 01:30:11.335
- [Walt] I got your
message, what's up?

01:30:11.371 --> 01:30:13.442
[mumbling]

01:30:15.271 --> 01:30:18.654
- Um, Wiley called a
meeting for tomorrow.

01:30:20.415 --> 01:30:22.071
Maybe she got a court date set.

01:30:23.314 --> 01:30:25.489
The papers say that it could be any day now, so...

01:30:29.941 --> 01:30:33.876
Finally, this is what
we've been waiting for.

01:30:33.911 --> 01:30:36.223
[soft music]

01:30:42.746 --> 01:30:44.300
What's going on?

01:30:44.335 --> 01:30:47.027
- Girls, this is
federal judge Clark.

01:30:47.062 --> 01:30:49.202
- Was a court date set?

01:30:49.236 --> 01:30:51.653
- I have been following
your painful story,

01:30:51.687 --> 01:30:55.346
so I took it upon myself
to negotiate a deal

01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:57.934
with American Radium
on your behalf.

01:30:57.969 --> 01:31:00.627
10 thousand, each.

01:31:00.662 --> 01:31:01.456
- Dollars?

01:31:02.491 --> 01:31:03.734
- Yes.

01:31:03.768 --> 01:31:05.977
And they'll pay for all
your medical expenses.

01:31:07.737 --> 01:31:10.291
- And are they admitting
that radium is toxic?

01:31:10.326 --> 01:31:11.914
- Oh, they'll shut
down the factory.

01:31:11.949 --> 01:31:14.157
Don't worry, it's all in there.

01:31:14.192 --> 01:31:15.918
- Okay, um...

01:31:15.952 --> 01:31:18.300
I'm sorry, but what about getting radium banned?

01:31:18.334 --> 01:31:20.267
That was--
- $10,000, Bessie!

01:31:20.302 --> 01:31:22.511
- Thank God! [laughs]

01:31:24.893 --> 01:31:27.067
- This is about more
than just one factory.

01:31:29.518 --> 01:31:31.209
There are future lives at stake.

01:31:32.348 --> 01:31:33.452
- Our lives are at stake.

01:31:33.487 --> 01:31:35.731
- American Radium has
a team of attorneys,

01:31:35.766 --> 01:31:37.077
the best in the state,

01:31:37.112 --> 01:31:39.183
with unlimited resources
at their disposal.

01:31:39.217 --> 01:31:41.496
- [Wiley] They could
drag this out for years.

01:31:42.427 --> 01:31:44.291
- We don't have years.

01:31:44.326 --> 01:31:46.984
- All they have to do
is run out the clock.

01:31:47.018 --> 01:31:48.433
It will be brutal.

01:31:57.891 --> 01:32:00.618
- My father has mortgaged our house to the gills.

01:32:03.379 --> 01:32:05.520
I don't want my boys growing up on the street.

01:32:15.357 --> 01:32:18.118
[dramatic music]

01:32:29.267 --> 01:32:31.062
- I just wanted it
to mean something.

01:32:32.305 --> 01:32:33.133
- It does.

01:32:35.757 --> 01:32:37.690
He says they'll shut
down the factory.

01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:40.589
That's good, Bessie.

01:32:47.630 --> 01:32:49.874
- So this is how it ends?

01:32:50.910 --> 01:32:52.255
- Can I tell you a secret

01:32:53.637 --> 01:32:55.500
I learned a long time ago?

01:32:57.468 --> 01:32:58.642
It never ends.

01:34:29.284 --> 01:34:31.493
[humming]

01:34:35.359 --> 01:34:40.364
- Do you mind if I sit?

01:34:45.264 --> 01:34:46.541
- You wanna help?

01:34:49.373 --> 01:34:50.754
- I'm too tired.

01:34:54.273 --> 01:34:56.449
- You're too young to
be tired, my child.

01:34:56.483 --> 01:34:58.485
Come on... [speaks
foreign language]

01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:00.902
The fishes, he's no
tired, he run away.

01:35:00.936 --> 01:35:03.663
You see, no like my worm.

01:35:03.698 --> 01:35:06.079
[chuckling]

01:35:10.290 --> 01:35:11.291
Bessie.

01:35:13.362 --> 01:35:18.367
Sometime these eyes too old to see something, no?

01:35:22.061 --> 01:35:22.855
I'm sorry.

01:35:30.966 --> 01:35:32.174
Forgive nonno?

01:35:36.316 --> 01:35:37.110
- Yeah.

01:35:37.939 --> 01:35:38.733
Of course.

01:35:45.325 --> 01:35:46.326
- I believe you.

01:35:48.362 --> 01:35:49.467
I believe everything now.

01:35:50.986 --> 01:35:53.748
[dramatic music]

01:35:59.719 --> 01:36:01.169
- [Josephine Voicover] I wish you could see yourself

01:36:01.202 --> 01:36:02.480
the way I see you.

01:36:04.517 --> 01:36:07.900
As a warrior, a goddess,

01:36:10.834 --> 01:36:12.214
full of power and light.

01:36:15.045 --> 01:36:17.633
A ticker tape
parade in your eyes.

01:36:17.668 --> 01:36:19.946
[laughing]

01:36:21.291 --> 01:36:23.743
Did you know some people call The Book Of The Dead

01:36:23.778 --> 01:36:26.021
The Book Of Coming
Forth Into Light?

01:36:26.056 --> 01:36:27.228
That's beautiful.

01:36:27.264 --> 01:36:28.437
Oh look, I love this part.

01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:32.371
[mumbling]

01:36:33.511 --> 01:36:36.825
Mayest thou be at peace with me.

01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:38.827
May I advance upon the earth.

01:36:40.864 --> 01:36:42.727
May I crush the evil one.

01:36:45.246 --> 01:36:48.318
May my arms become spears to thwart crocodiles.

01:36:52.772 --> 01:36:55.602
May I live in the
season of revolution.

01:37:00.538 --> 01:37:03.507
May the light of my soul
detect shadows of evil.

01:37:05.509 --> 01:37:07.373
The doors of perception open.

01:37:09.340 --> 01:37:10.894
- Hey!
