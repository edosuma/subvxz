WEBVTT

01:13.573 --> 01:15.950
I hurt Li-sa. I'm truly sorry.

01:16.701 --> 01:17.660
<i>Hannah.</i>

01:18.369 --> 01:19.454
You remember.

01:22.624 --> 01:25.418
<i>Hui-ju. It's really been a long time.</i>

01:30.381 --> 01:33.176
You're right.
It has nothing to do with that incident.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.390
<i>She didn't…</i>

01:40.350 --> 01:43.019
<i>come here to apologize.</i>

02:02.163 --> 02:07.585
EPISODE 2
YOUR NAME IS

02:20.348 --> 02:22.517
I guess I was of help to you.

02:26.437 --> 02:31.192
But then again, you're likely to
create new things if you keep imitating.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.739
After all, that was how art first started.

03:01.764 --> 03:03.099
Gone?

03:03.600 --> 03:06.477
How can an unconscious man disappear?

03:06.561 --> 03:09.564
<i>The nurse said a woman named Hannah
came with papers and requested</i>

03:09.647 --> 03:11.816
<i>the hospital to discharge him.</i>

03:13.526 --> 03:14.736
Hannah?

03:14.819 --> 03:17.780
<i>Yes. Only family members
are allowed to discharge the patients,</i>

03:18.364 --> 03:19.782
<i>and she submitted the papers.</i>

03:19.866 --> 03:21.534
He has a family?

03:21.618 --> 03:23.077
<i>I'll look into it.</i>

03:23.703 --> 03:26.623
<i>The John Doe's name was Seo Woo-jae.</i>

03:31.085 --> 03:32.170
<i>Sir?</i>

03:33.421 --> 03:35.340
Is he still in Ireland?

03:35.423 --> 03:36.633
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

03:37.133 --> 03:40.553
<i>His passport's expired,
so it'll take some time to check.</i>

03:50.188 --> 03:51.272
Hannah?

03:54.734 --> 03:55.860
Hannah?

04:55.753 --> 04:57.255
Why did you do it?

05:19.527 --> 05:20.695
Where's Li-sa?

05:20.778 --> 05:23.281
-She's gone to bed
-Already?

05:23.364 --> 05:26.326
She met her friend this afternoon.
I guess she's tired.

05:26.909 --> 05:28.786
A friend? Who?

05:29.829 --> 05:31.414
I'm not sure.

05:31.497 --> 05:34.167
Also, Ho-su is with his grandmother.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.878
She said she'd send him home
after feeding him dinner.

05:36.961 --> 05:38.671
I told her not to.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.341
Thank you. You may go home.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.302
-Okay. Good night.
-Good night.

05:46.679 --> 05:48.431
-Thank you. Good night.
-Good night.

05:59.817 --> 06:03.279
Why did you let her in
if you were going to be bothered so much?

06:06.240 --> 06:08.951
She got on her knees.
I couldn't just send her away.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.788
Even if she comes back
to apologize, ignore her.

06:13.748 --> 06:18.086
If she makes you feel uncomfortable,
it's wrong even if she means well.

06:18.169 --> 06:20.254
You know you can't hold your liquor.

06:21.964 --> 06:23.466
It's to help me sleep.

06:26.552 --> 06:30.306
What's the matter?
Did something happen today?

06:31.349 --> 06:32.517
Well, I just…

06:33.476 --> 06:35.686
I lost something by mistake today.

06:36.687 --> 06:37.688
What did you lose?

06:39.524 --> 06:40.942
It's nothing important.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.278
I just need to find it. I'll find it.

06:47.406 --> 06:49.700
Why did Ms. Gu
suddenly have a change of heart?

06:51.828 --> 06:52.954
I don't know.

06:53.913 --> 06:56.332
But I'm certain
she has an ulterior motive.

06:58.751 --> 07:01.838
People don't change for no reason.

07:09.387 --> 07:12.807
If she withdraws the suit,
isn't it a good thing for us?

07:13.891 --> 07:17.812
Well, we don't know for certain

07:18.354 --> 07:19.730
if it's good or bad.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.475
It's noisy!

08:37.558 --> 08:39.977
It's so noisy!

08:40.561 --> 08:44.023
It's so noisy!

08:50.530 --> 08:51.822
Li-sa.

08:52.907 --> 08:53.908
Li-sa!

08:56.077 --> 08:57.161
I can't hear.

08:58.079 --> 08:58.955
What?

08:59.914 --> 09:01.582
I can't hear anything!

09:01.666 --> 09:04.252
I can't hear a thing!

09:04.335 --> 09:07.129
-I can't hear!
-Goodness, Li-sa!

09:07.630 --> 09:10.132
-I can't hear anything!
-What's with her? Is she nuts?

09:10.216 --> 09:12.218
-You can't hear?
-I can't!

09:12.301 --> 09:14.387
-Honey! Hyeon-seong!
-She's being weird.

09:14.470 --> 09:15.805
What's wrong?

09:15.888 --> 09:17.098
What are you saying?

09:17.181 --> 09:19.225
Can you not hear me?

09:19.308 --> 09:21.018
-Hey.
-I can't hear you!

09:21.102 --> 09:22.645
-Can't you hear us?
-I can't hear!

09:22.728 --> 09:24.146
-Li-sa!
-Dad's in the study.

09:24.230 --> 09:27.316
-Go to the study. Li-sa.
-Li-sa!

09:27.400 --> 09:29.610
Li-sa, look at me. It's okay.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.404
-Look at me.
-Mom.

09:31.487 --> 09:32.655
Look at… What?

09:32.738 --> 09:34.490
-My throat hurts.
-Hold on.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.909
-Look at me. What should I do?
-My throat hurts!

09:36.993 --> 09:38.995
-Do you not hear me?
-I can't hear anything!

09:39.078 --> 09:41.622
How many times must I repeat myself?
I can't hear you!

09:41.706 --> 09:44.542
-I can't hear a thing!
-Okay.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.377
-Get out!
-Calm down.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.468
-I'll have the same.
-Okay.

09:54.552 --> 09:55.553
Hello.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.347
Li-sa keeps causing trouble.

09:58.848 --> 10:02.727
You should've just kept her in England
even though she was lonely.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.938
Thanks to her,
my husband is going through a hassle.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.153
Well, Ho-su needs to go to kindergarten.

10:12.236 --> 10:15.698
You should watch out.
My mom might steal your son away.

10:16.574 --> 10:20.620
This is why I don't let
Jeong-hwan visit Korea often.

10:20.703 --> 10:24.081
I wouldn't worry about Li-sa though.
She spent enough time with her.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.082
Plus, she's a girl.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.501
But does that matter these days?

10:28.878 --> 10:29.795
It does to her.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.923
She prefers sons.

10:33.549 --> 10:36.260
You took her son from her,
so she wants yours.

10:37.762 --> 10:40.014
People aren't objects you can just take.

10:43.017 --> 10:45.019
But that's just how she is.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.439
Times may have changed,
but some just remain the same.

10:48.522 --> 10:50.941
Especially old people

10:51.025 --> 10:53.611
who are wealthy.

10:54.779 --> 10:58.366
Because it's been proven
that their way is right.

10:58.449 --> 11:00.368
Your drinks are ready.

11:17.551 --> 11:19.804
Did the doctor come to see her?
What did they say?

11:19.887 --> 11:21.722
That her ears are fine.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.015
Then what's wrong?

11:23.099 --> 11:24.767
Apparently, it's psychological.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.311
She needs more counseling to find out why.

11:29.647 --> 11:33.734
Where did you go in the middle
of the night without telling me?

11:34.360 --> 11:36.195
I couldn't sleep, so I went for a walk.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.197
But you drank.

11:41.617 --> 11:43.119
MOTHER

11:43.828 --> 11:45.162
I should go.

11:45.246 --> 11:46.664
Li-sa just fell asleep.

11:46.747 --> 11:49.500
And don't forget to pick Ho-su up.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.168
Okay.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.833
TOWNHOUSE MAINTENANCE OFFICE

12:59.361 --> 13:02.364
<i>She met her friend this afternoon.
I guess she's tired.</i>

13:14.210 --> 13:18.130
Grandma, Bob is the name
of the dinosaur in this book.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.299
Is that so? His name is Bob?

13:20.382 --> 13:21.884
Yes. Isn't it funny?

13:21.967 --> 13:24.094
His entire body is green.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.263
He takes the train alongside people.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.432
He can also eat over 7,000 hotdogs.

13:28.516 --> 13:31.852
That many? My goodness.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.397
She violated the Juvenile Welfare Act?

13:37.274 --> 13:41.153
I heard Ms. Gu caused a commotion
during class last month.

13:42.279 --> 13:44.698
If some of the students were offended,

13:44.782 --> 13:47.243
it could be an issue
even though the others were okay.

13:47.910 --> 13:51.789
If the teachers' rights clash
with the students' rights,

13:51.872 --> 13:54.083
the latter apparently come first.

13:54.166 --> 13:57.169
Must we go this far
when she's dropped all charges?

13:57.253 --> 13:59.505
Why did you let her sue us
in the first place?

14:01.924 --> 14:02.841
What if it fails?

14:02.925 --> 14:05.135
We'll raise an issue
with what she said in class.

14:05.219 --> 14:09.056
If the disciplinary committee acknowledges
that it had a negative effect

14:09.139 --> 14:11.976
on teenagers' view of
sexually graphic material,

14:12.059 --> 14:15.479
she may not receive criminal penalty,
but she won't get to teach again.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.441
That's not too bad.

14:19.525 --> 14:22.611
Let's not rush ourselves.
It might cause a bigger issue.

14:23.654 --> 14:26.699
How can you say that
after what your daughter has gone through?

14:26.782 --> 14:30.035
We should teach her
not to mess with the wrong people.

14:31.161 --> 14:33.789
It's already evident
that we have the upper hand.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.624
Even if Li-sa is the victim--

14:35.708 --> 14:39.753
Who cares who has the upper hand
in a battle?

14:39.837 --> 14:40.880
We just need to win.

14:42.673 --> 14:44.091
Grandma, look at this.

14:44.758 --> 14:48.971
Goodness, your drawing is better
than the book, sweetie.

14:49.555 --> 14:52.057
Who do you take after to draw so well?

14:52.641 --> 14:54.059
I want some ice cream.

14:54.810 --> 14:57.062
Ice cream? Okay.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.078
Were you going to just walk away?

15:14.705 --> 15:16.457
I'm sorry.

15:19.126 --> 15:21.795
Good. What a good boy you are.

15:23.547 --> 15:25.841
But that's no longer edible, is it?

15:35.059 --> 15:36.143
Ho-su.

15:38.729 --> 15:41.440
What are you doing here?
Are you by yourself?

15:41.523 --> 15:43.525
-Where's Dad?
-He's on the phone.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.862
You were waving at someone. Who was it?

15:46.946 --> 15:48.030
I don't know.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.366
Why would you wave at a stranger?

15:50.449 --> 15:52.368
I accidentally got ice cream on her.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.455
Wait, you're having ice cream
before lunch?

15:56.538 --> 15:58.624
A dinosaur-looking lady bought it for me.

16:00.626 --> 16:01.752
Dinosaur?

16:05.339 --> 16:06.548
Lady?

16:08.592 --> 16:10.344
The dinosaur lady is gone.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.947
Excuse me. Hello.

17:15.909 --> 17:17.745
-I'm the physical--
-I know.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.582
-Do you go to this church?
-No.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.502
It's near the hospital,
so I just dropped by.

17:25.586 --> 17:26.879
I see.

17:28.005 --> 17:29.173
Goodbye, then.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.467
I was curious.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.930
I wanted to see the faces of those
who confessed their sins.

17:40.517 --> 17:43.937
I hope those who commit
serious sins don't do that.

17:46.815 --> 17:49.818
Look at her. She looks so much at peace.

17:50.569 --> 17:53.280
It shouldn't be that easy to be forgiven.

17:53.363 --> 17:55.157
It isn't.

18:18.764 --> 18:19.807
Can you hear now?

18:23.727 --> 18:24.812
Does it hurt at all?

18:32.903 --> 18:35.906
I heard your friend came yesterday.
Was it Ju-yeong?

18:41.286 --> 18:42.454
Li-sa.

18:49.336 --> 18:53.841
Did something happen that upset you?

18:55.676 --> 18:57.845
Is there anything you want to tell me?

19:00.097 --> 19:01.056
No.

19:05.060 --> 19:06.603
Do you not want to talk about it?

19:07.729 --> 19:09.940
-I need to go to the bathroom.
-Okay.

19:10.023 --> 19:13.443
Let me know anytime
if you want to talk about anything.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.028
I'm always here for you.

19:31.962 --> 19:35.799
AN LI-SA
THIS ACCOUNT IS PRIVATE

19:44.516 --> 19:46.101
-Hello.
-Hello.

20:01.116 --> 20:01.992
Hey.

20:06.496 --> 20:07.664
Don't be nervous.

20:09.333 --> 20:10.918
I can't help it.

20:12.753 --> 20:17.591
Right. I guess this place
could be intimidating for students.

20:24.765 --> 20:25.974
Doesn't it look realistic?

20:29.269 --> 20:31.146
Li-sa held me from behind.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.689
I only filmed my legs first

20:32.773 --> 20:36.360
then dropped my phone
after tying it with a string later.

20:38.445 --> 20:39.905
You did this all by yourself?

20:40.489 --> 20:42.991
Yes. Doesn't it look real
because it's all shaky?

20:44.451 --> 20:45.452
It does.

20:46.286 --> 20:49.665
It must look realistic.
That's what's most important.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.879
You don't look like a dad.

20:58.131 --> 20:59.299
That's a compliment.

21:04.972 --> 21:06.556
This is about Li-sa, right?

21:07.391 --> 21:08.308
Yes.

21:08.892 --> 21:10.769
Did something happen yesterday?

21:11.603 --> 21:13.563
She was a little ill.

21:14.147 --> 21:15.649
It wasn't because of me.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.361
She was the one who invited me over.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.738
But I left because she was all cranky.

21:23.115 --> 21:26.451
I used to put up with her, but I heard
that's not the right thing to do

21:26.994 --> 21:28.287
and that I should be honest.

21:28.370 --> 21:29.997
You should be honest?

21:30.080 --> 21:33.333
Yes. I heard that a true friend is
someone you can be honest with

21:33.417 --> 21:36.878
about your feelings
whether you're happy or sad.

21:36.962 --> 21:39.339
If you just put up with it,
you become a doormat.

21:41.008 --> 21:42.342
Who said that?

21:42.426 --> 21:43.343
Mimi.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.430
I mean, the art teacher.

21:49.725 --> 21:51.101
Ms. Gu?

21:55.564 --> 21:57.399
CONFESSIONAL

22:15.125 --> 22:16.335
How do I look?

22:19.004 --> 22:21.006
How does it feel to be forgiven?

22:21.715 --> 22:22.758
I'm not sure.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.677
I haven't been forgiven yet.

22:25.761 --> 22:28.013
What did you do so wrong?

22:28.096 --> 22:29.723
You seem like an honest man.

22:29.806 --> 22:32.768
Gosh, you're a poor judge of character.

22:34.644 --> 22:35.896
That's true.

22:37.397 --> 22:39.357
Seon-u, let's go eat.

22:40.692 --> 22:42.903
There's a nice <i>kalguksu</i> place
in Hongeun-dong.

22:45.197 --> 22:48.867
My lunch break will be over soon,
so I don't think I can go that far.

22:48.950 --> 22:50.952
But you still need to eat.

22:51.745 --> 22:52.662
Where should we go?

22:58.001 --> 22:59.086
I was here first.

23:00.087 --> 23:00.921
Sorry?

23:01.505 --> 23:03.548
I also made lunch plans with him.

23:04.132 --> 23:05.425
Would you like to join?

23:06.176 --> 23:09.137
How about <i>tonkatsu</i>?
I know a place in front of the hospital.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.555
Let's go.

23:16.895 --> 23:20.232
I'm sorry, but I have other plans.

23:41.586 --> 23:43.171
You eat well.

23:43.255 --> 23:46.174
I do. I need to eat well
and live a long, healthy life.

23:47.217 --> 23:49.261
No need to get all serious.

23:51.346 --> 23:52.305
But I am serious.

23:55.392 --> 23:56.268
Are you in debt?

23:57.269 --> 23:58.103
Sorry?

23:58.186 --> 24:00.105
To the woman we met earlier.

24:00.188 --> 24:01.273
Her?

24:02.357 --> 24:05.026
I don't think I can call it a debt.

24:07.320 --> 24:10.699
Since it's not something I can repay.

24:17.539 --> 24:18.623
So…

24:20.292 --> 24:22.127
Thank you for saving me back there.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.759
I got fired. I'm unemployed right now.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.721
And things will only get harder.

24:32.804 --> 24:35.265
It doesn't sound so bad
when I say it like this, right?

24:36.725 --> 24:38.143
You should talk about it.

24:40.687 --> 24:44.399
Not to me. I mean someone
you feel comfortable with.

24:46.276 --> 24:47.110
Okay.

24:47.194 --> 24:50.447
UNJEONG GOMTANG

24:54.951 --> 24:55.994
Yes?

24:56.953 --> 24:58.288
Hey.

24:59.873 --> 25:01.124
Right now?

25:02.083 --> 25:05.128
I'm sorry, but I'm with someone right now.

25:07.005 --> 25:09.341
Would you like to come here then?

25:56.763 --> 25:58.515
Who was that guy?

25:59.891 --> 26:02.477
Just someone I know.

26:05.480 --> 26:06.731
Do you meet him often?

26:07.691 --> 26:08.858
What's your relationship?

26:09.901 --> 26:12.279
Are you here to find out who I'm seeing?

26:13.488 --> 26:15.282
Why are you curious about that?

26:18.034 --> 26:20.787
You're right. That's none of my business.

26:21.538 --> 26:24.833
Li-sa was pretty ill last night.
She was even taken to the ER.

26:26.209 --> 26:27.877
Goodness. Why?

26:27.961 --> 26:29.796
I heard it's psychological.

26:30.755 --> 26:32.048
I think it's because

26:33.133 --> 26:34.384
of what you did to her.

26:34.467 --> 26:36.803
How about I talk to her?

26:36.886 --> 26:38.388
No, you can't.

26:39.347 --> 26:43.310
I think she saw you while she was out
to meet her friend Ju-yeong.

26:43.393 --> 26:45.520
And that must've shocked her.

26:47.188 --> 26:48.732
What were you still doing there

26:48.815 --> 26:53.153
in front of my house
after leaving my studio?

26:54.279 --> 26:55.405
I was taking a walk.

26:56.239 --> 26:58.199
You have such a nice walking trail.

26:59.951 --> 27:03.872
You decided to take a walk
when you came to apologize?

27:04.706 --> 27:06.499
I had a lot on my mind.

27:07.208 --> 27:10.211
But I'm sorry if you were offended.

27:13.882 --> 27:16.426
Li-sa remains tight-lipped
about what happened that day.

27:17.677 --> 27:19.346
Her therapist thinks

27:19.846 --> 27:22.974
she's avoiding what makes her angry.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.811
Keeping it bottled up
could cause an episode like that.

27:28.271 --> 27:30.607
Before the incident,

27:30.690 --> 27:33.443
Li-sa was a cheerful, sweet,
and kind girl.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.571
This never happened before.

27:36.654 --> 27:38.823
Really? Never?

27:40.617 --> 27:43.787
All the parents I've met are like this.

27:44.537 --> 27:46.956
They never think
their children might be the problem.

27:48.041 --> 27:51.127
They're only worried
that their friends or teachers

27:51.211 --> 27:52.629
might rub off on them.

27:56.966 --> 27:59.052
I heard you said something to her.

27:59.552 --> 28:00.929
What did you tell her…

28:02.972 --> 28:04.391
after hitting her?

28:07.310 --> 28:09.020
I told her to stop…

28:12.273 --> 28:15.735
because I know everything.

28:25.954 --> 28:28.456
Your drawings will be included
in your grades.

28:28.540 --> 28:31.418
You must finish it during class.

28:31.501 --> 28:35.922
Unless it's absolutely necessary, you
won't be given extra time to finish it up.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.136
That'll be all.

28:41.219 --> 28:42.637
-How did you do?
-How was it?

28:43.221 --> 28:45.473
-You drew a lot.
-I think I did pretty well.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.896
-What's the next class?
-I don't know. Math?

28:51.980 --> 28:53.690
Math? How boring.

28:55.900 --> 29:00.071
<i>You can't blame someone for
buying someone else's talent or effort.</i>

29:00.697 --> 29:05.452
However, having no respect
for other people is a different story.

29:06.202 --> 29:09.247
I guess she turned out that way
since no one told her it was wrong.

29:10.165 --> 29:13.084
She believes she can get away with it.

29:14.252 --> 29:16.379
Li-sa is still young,

29:16.463 --> 29:18.089
so she can still change.

29:19.340 --> 29:21.718
I'm not saying I'm proud of what I did.

29:22.218 --> 29:25.430
Now that I think back,

29:27.223 --> 29:29.601
I don't know why I was so enraged.

29:34.105 --> 29:35.231
<i>She's lying.</i>

29:37.650 --> 29:38.568
It's a lie.

29:40.528 --> 29:42.530
That's why I'm asking you.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.783
It could've been a misunderstanding.

29:45.909 --> 29:50.079
I know you and Ju-yeong have been close
ever since you came to the school.

29:50.163 --> 29:52.332
I'm sure you had your reasons.

29:54.250 --> 29:56.377
Everything had been fine until recently.

29:56.961 --> 29:59.798
But Ju-yeong changed
because of that crazy bitch.

30:02.592 --> 30:05.637
So Mom, don't meet that woman.

30:35.917 --> 30:37.502
<i>The phone can't be picked up…</i>

30:37.585 --> 30:40.338
Why isn't he picking up?

30:55.436 --> 30:56.437
Hui-ju.

30:58.189 --> 30:59.315
What brings you here?

30:59.399 --> 31:02.068
Why haven't you been picking up?

31:02.151 --> 31:03.736
Don't you check your texts?

31:03.820 --> 31:06.531
I left my phone at the hospital.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.952
What's the matter? Is something wrong?

31:11.536 --> 31:12.912
Gu Hae-won.

31:15.290 --> 31:16.749
How do you know her?

31:16.833 --> 31:20.169
She's just a patient of mine.

31:20.253 --> 31:22.964
Do you usually eat with your patients?

31:23.047 --> 31:25.341
No. I just ran into her yesterday.

31:25.425 --> 31:27.927
How do you know if it was a coincidence?

31:28.887 --> 31:31.347
She's the teacher who hit Li-sa.

31:31.431 --> 31:33.057
I can't believe she came to you.

31:34.726 --> 31:37.937
It looks like you had no idea,
so stay away from her from now on.

31:38.605 --> 31:41.566
She hasn't been disciplined yet,

31:41.649 --> 31:44.569
and Li-sa is still going through
a hard time because of her.

31:44.652 --> 31:46.154
Don't make me say it twice.

32:03.004 --> 32:05.256
-Hello.
-Hello.

32:05.340 --> 32:07.592
-Can we talk for a minute?
-Sure.

32:26.694 --> 32:28.988
How is Li-sa doing?

32:29.072 --> 32:30.698
She's a smart girl,

32:30.782 --> 32:34.202
so with a little bit of guidance,
she'll catch up just fine.

32:34.285 --> 32:37.622
But she's overly coolheaded
for someone her age.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.417
It may seem
like she's brushing it off for now,

32:41.501 --> 32:43.586
but she could explode later on.

32:43.670 --> 32:46.381
Kids her age can be unpredictable.

32:53.179 --> 32:54.597
Can I have some ice cream?

32:54.681 --> 32:57.308
Yes. Put your backpack down,
wash your hands,

32:57.392 --> 32:59.394
and say hi to your sister's tutor first.

33:01.020 --> 33:03.356
I'm also worried about that.

33:03.439 --> 33:06.359
She keeps saying she's fine,

33:06.442 --> 33:08.111
-but usually--
-My ice cream.

33:08.945 --> 33:11.739
Please.

33:11.823 --> 33:15.368
I'm talking with her.
Can you please wait a little?

33:17.453 --> 33:22.333
And I'm scared to ask her again
because it might make things worse.

33:22.417 --> 33:25.003
Ho-su, I told you not to rub your eye.

33:25.086 --> 33:26.796
Just press down on it.

33:26.879 --> 33:28.172
Don't rub it.

33:29.173 --> 33:31.926
If it itches,
you should apply ointment to it.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.345
Ma'am, can you please apply ointment
on Ho-su's eye?

33:34.429 --> 33:35.263
Yes, ma'am.

33:35.346 --> 33:37.807
You could bleed, you know?

33:39.350 --> 33:40.393
Ho-su.

33:41.644 --> 33:44.564
I want ice cream!

33:46.357 --> 33:47.859
I'm sorry.

33:47.942 --> 33:51.654
Kids his age naturally require
a lot of attention.

33:51.738 --> 33:54.282
Li-sa wasn't like him.

33:54.365 --> 33:55.491
But with Ho-su,

33:55.575 --> 33:59.370
it feels as if I'm always
doing things wrong.

34:02.665 --> 34:04.333
So about Li-sa…

34:04.417 --> 34:07.170
TO THE WORLD WITH YOUR DREAMS FROM TAERIM

34:07.754 --> 34:09.130
TEMPORARY TEACHER RECOMMENDATION

34:09.213 --> 34:10.840
So Ms. Gu was recommended by the VP

34:10.923 --> 34:13.134
instead of going through
the proper procedure?

34:13.217 --> 34:16.971
That's correct.
The VP's daughter asked for the favor.

34:19.182 --> 34:21.184
Are you saying she was hired

34:21.851 --> 34:23.936
because she was an acquaintance?

34:24.020 --> 34:27.982
Her papers looked fine,
and she had a good reputation.

34:28.066 --> 34:29.776
We only needed her for a semester,

34:29.859 --> 34:31.778
so I didn't think too much about it.

34:31.861 --> 34:33.321
I see.

34:34.280 --> 34:35.573
I'll talk to her myself.

34:39.827 --> 34:43.122
There was a complaint
against us becoming an arts high school.

34:43.206 --> 34:46.167
Here are some picket signs
that were outside the Education Office.

34:46.250 --> 34:47.668
Take a look.

34:51.506 --> 34:55.384
PROTECT OUR PROPERTY RIGHTS

35:07.438 --> 35:08.815
This isn't a surprise.

35:08.898 --> 35:12.026
Let's promote those who are
in favor of the transformation.

35:12.985 --> 35:13.820
You may leave.

35:23.663 --> 35:25.998
DIRECTOR AN HYEON-SEONG

35:27.416 --> 35:30.169
<i>Mr. Seo Woo-jae was issued
an emergency passport</i>

35:30.253 --> 35:32.380
<i>and has left Ireland.</i>

35:33.506 --> 35:35.216
<i>I'll send you the family certificate</i>

35:35.299 --> 35:37.885
<i>that was submitted
to the hospital for his discharge.</i>

35:46.853 --> 35:48.104
Where did you go?

36:17.008 --> 36:20.845
We'll put up a canvas here
so that the audience can participate.

36:22.054 --> 36:24.432
The wooden windows will be installed here.

36:24.515 --> 36:26.100
Every time the windows open,

36:26.184 --> 36:29.061
they will hear the wind
and other sound effects.

36:29.145 --> 36:32.148
And the design will be done as you asked.

36:35.193 --> 36:38.321
Did you hear about the intro video
that'll be put up at the entrance?

36:38.404 --> 36:39.655
Here is the questionnaire.

36:39.739 --> 36:43.326
Let us know if there are any works
you'd like explained separately.

36:43.409 --> 36:46.204
But I feel uncomfortable
about shooting a video.

36:46.287 --> 36:50.124
People will be given guidebooks,
but they prefer videos these days.

36:51.334 --> 36:53.669
The president also looks forward to it.

36:53.753 --> 36:56.005
You know how much she loves your work.

36:56.088 --> 36:58.925
Will I get to see her in person this time?

36:59.008 --> 37:01.385
Yes. She'll be back in Korea
to see your exhibition.

37:01.469 --> 37:02.720
I see.

37:04.055 --> 37:07.475
EXHIBITION UNDER PREPARATION

37:08.893 --> 37:10.686
That spot was always vacant.

37:11.270 --> 37:14.232
I haven't heard of the artist,
but the president recommended her.

37:14.315 --> 37:16.108
You know she loves finding rookies.

37:16.192 --> 37:19.195
The exhibition schedule
is similar to yours.

37:20.446 --> 37:21.447
Is that so?

37:38.464 --> 37:39.548
Ms. Gu Hae-won?

37:43.219 --> 37:45.096
You're not what I expected.

37:45.805 --> 37:48.641
You seem disappointed. I'm sorry.

37:50.518 --> 37:52.103
Let's talk on our way.

38:46.574 --> 38:47.658
They're the ones.

38:49.035 --> 38:50.953
How do you have them?

39:41.212 --> 39:43.381
You can't quit this, can you?

39:43.464 --> 39:46.884
No, but not because it reminds me
of the old days. It's just so delicious.

39:47.510 --> 39:48.677
Of course.

39:48.761 --> 39:51.222
Why think of the sickening past?

39:55.976 --> 39:57.561
So how's Li-sa?

39:58.562 --> 39:59.855
She says she's okay.

40:00.731 --> 40:02.733
She seems okay in front of me.

40:04.568 --> 40:06.153
Teenagers are like that.

40:07.029 --> 40:09.907
Why didn't you bring Ho-su?
I really wanted to see him.

40:12.034 --> 40:14.203
I just can't handle that kid.

40:15.079 --> 40:17.373
I think he's determined to hate me.

40:17.456 --> 40:18.749
He shows me no affection.

40:18.833 --> 40:20.876
Don't show it.

40:20.960 --> 40:24.839
Kids feel it
when their mothers are tired of them.

40:30.636 --> 40:34.306
Isn't it scary to live here alone?
It's been years.

40:34.390 --> 40:35.224
No.

40:37.768 --> 40:41.188
People scare me more.

40:41.772 --> 40:43.190
Gosh, seriously.

40:53.159 --> 40:54.285
So what's bothering you?

40:59.248 --> 41:02.626
I don't have kids, so I doubt
you're here to get advice about them.

41:02.710 --> 41:03.919
Now, tell me.

41:07.298 --> 41:10.301
<i>I guess it's something serious</i>

41:10.384 --> 41:12.928
Don't tell me, then. I prefer not to know.

41:15.764 --> 41:17.600
About that guy you used to date.

41:18.184 --> 41:19.935
Which one? I've dated tons.

41:20.644 --> 41:24.231
The one who retired
from working at Yongsan Police Station

41:24.315 --> 41:25.774
and spent all day fishing.

41:26.817 --> 41:28.694
That old-fashioned guy?

41:28.777 --> 41:29.945
Are you still in touch?

41:30.029 --> 41:32.448
We could be. Why do you ask?

41:34.366 --> 41:36.911
I ran into someone
I never wanted to see again.

41:39.163 --> 41:40.539
So I want to check something.

41:40.623 --> 41:43.417
You don't even want
to see them again, so what for?

41:44.168 --> 41:46.670
I want to know if we met by coincidence

41:47.505 --> 41:48.839
or if it was intentional.

42:08.651 --> 42:10.027
<i>I met Li-sa's dad.</i>

42:11.028 --> 42:12.238
LEE JU-YEONG

42:12.321 --> 42:13.739
<i>Did he give you a hard time?</i>

42:16.784 --> 42:19.662
<i>No, he seemed like a great guy.</i>

42:21.247 --> 42:22.748
A great guy?

42:40.474 --> 42:41.392
What do you want?

42:43.269 --> 42:44.353
What do you mean?

42:45.187 --> 42:46.772
Why are you here?

42:48.524 --> 42:50.943
Do I need a reason to come over?

42:59.118 --> 43:00.786
You obviously came for a reason.

43:05.457 --> 43:06.542
What is it?

43:07.418 --> 43:08.794
Did a guy rip you off again?

43:08.877 --> 43:10.212
You little brat.

43:13.424 --> 43:16.594
Why were you sleeping this early
with your coat on?

43:19.138 --> 43:20.472
Dad…

43:23.767 --> 43:27.187
I mean, your grandfather is worried sick
because he can't reach you.

43:27.271 --> 43:28.522
Give him a call tomorrow.

43:31.900 --> 43:35.654
You can't be like that to my dad.
Have you forgotten how he raised you?

43:35.738 --> 43:38.032
-I haven't.
-And you do this?

43:38.115 --> 43:41.327
That's exactly why.
I'm embarrassed to face him.

43:44.538 --> 43:48.500
He's not easily shocked
thanks to what I've put him through.

43:48.584 --> 43:49.418
Just call him.

43:50.502 --> 43:53.172
He even called your school,
but he couldn't reach you.

43:53.255 --> 43:54.798
Don't tell me you got fired.

43:54.882 --> 43:56.925
-I quit.
-Why?

43:57.009 --> 43:59.803
-I had something to do.
-As if.

44:01.347 --> 44:03.057
By any chance, did you--

44:03.140 --> 44:04.266
No.

44:08.062 --> 44:10.022
I swear it's not what you think.

44:25.454 --> 44:26.997
What is it now?

44:27.081 --> 44:29.124
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

44:29.208 --> 44:30.376
You just had chips.

44:30.459 --> 44:32.336
This won't fill me up.

44:32.419 --> 44:33.754
Get up now.

44:36.340 --> 44:39.968
I wonder how he ended up
opening a bar in this shabby neighborhood.

44:58.946 --> 45:01.281
What the hell? Why is it so good?

45:01.865 --> 45:04.034
He's a much better cook
than the former owner.

45:06.078 --> 45:08.747
When did she leave though?
She didn't even tell me.

45:10.749 --> 45:13.877
This liquor is both sweet and spicy.

45:16.338 --> 45:17.381
It's a good starter.

45:19.174 --> 45:20.175
Sir.

45:20.884 --> 45:23.053
You look familiar. Do you live near here?

45:23.137 --> 45:24.388
No, I don't.

45:26.014 --> 45:26.974
Are you two…

45:28.016 --> 45:28.851
sisters?

45:29.518 --> 45:32.104
You look so much alike.
Is she your older sister?

45:33.730 --> 45:35.607
-She's my mom.
-Really?

45:36.358 --> 45:38.485
Gosh, you really don't seem like it.

45:38.986 --> 45:40.362
You look so young.

45:41.780 --> 45:43.532
She had me when she was 17.

45:43.615 --> 45:45.784
Gosh, what are you even saying?

45:47.369 --> 45:48.871
Sir.

45:49.997 --> 45:53.292
Why don't you give this to your wife?

45:54.751 --> 45:58.005
First-time buyers get to have
their skin checked and exfoliated.

45:58.088 --> 45:59.173
GU JEONG-YEON

45:59.256 --> 46:01.800
Can I just use this myself?

46:01.884 --> 46:04.678
I'll give you more samples for you.
Give that to your wife.

46:05.345 --> 46:06.180
I'm single.

46:06.763 --> 46:10.934
I knew it. I knew you were single.
I can tell you were never married.

46:11.018 --> 46:12.186
No, it's not that.

46:14.188 --> 46:15.022
She passed away.

46:16.690 --> 46:18.817
Right. I guess that could be it too.

46:18.901 --> 46:21.904
At our age, it's not unusual
for people to pass away.

46:21.987 --> 46:23.280
Right. Of course.

46:27.034 --> 46:28.494
My mom's single too.

46:30.204 --> 46:32.164
But I don't think her husband is dead.

46:32.247 --> 46:33.290
Hey.

46:35.250 --> 46:37.211
I'll have whatever she's drinking.

46:40.923 --> 46:43.634
Hey. You didn't need to say that.

46:43.717 --> 46:46.345
-You don't need to do this either.
-Do what?

46:47.513 --> 46:49.598
Come here and check if I'm still alive.

46:52.226 --> 46:54.478
I purposely moved to your neighborhood.

46:55.354 --> 46:56.605
What are you talking about?

46:58.148 --> 47:02.027
If I become suicidal again,
I'll call you first

47:02.778 --> 47:03.987
and ask for help.

47:12.412 --> 47:14.748
Ms. Jeong, we're ready to shoot.

47:15.332 --> 47:16.333
Okay.

47:17.334 --> 47:20.712
You're known for pursuing happiness
in the moment.

47:20.796 --> 47:21.838
That's right.

47:22.506 --> 47:25.133
Because misfortune comes
whether you like it or not.

47:25.717 --> 47:28.929
So I try to find happy moments

47:29.012 --> 47:31.473
and paint them on my canvas.

47:31.557 --> 47:34.476
Hello, I'm Jeong Hui-ju,
and I'm a painter.

47:37.312 --> 47:39.064
<i>I used to be a housewife</i>

47:39.147 --> 47:41.650
<i>until I sent my daughter abroad.</i>

47:41.733 --> 47:45.821
<i>Suddenly, I lost my purpose
and felt empty inside.</i>

47:47.072 --> 47:49.950
<i>One day, I visited her.</i>

47:50.033 --> 47:52.452
But she was too busy adjusting,

47:52.536 --> 47:54.955
so I felt lonely even when I was with her.

47:56.039 --> 47:58.709
<i>I was happy to see her,
but it only lasted a few days.</i>

47:59.543 --> 48:03.130
I felt scared and frustrated
to be left alone.

48:03.755 --> 48:05.799
<i>I wanted to communicate,</i>

48:06.383 --> 48:09.428
but I could only say

48:09.511 --> 48:12.180
<i>a few words in English.</i>

48:12.681 --> 48:16.685
<i>That's when I began painting.</i>

48:17.644 --> 48:19.730
<i>I knew no one there.</i>

48:20.230 --> 48:22.566
<i>And nobody knew me either.</i>

48:22.649 --> 48:24.192
<i>I was neither a wife</i>

48:25.277 --> 48:27.821
<i>nor a mother there.</i>

48:28.530 --> 48:30.782
<i>I communicated through my paintings.</i>

48:33.285 --> 48:36.538
That's how it all began.

49:08.904 --> 49:11.198
<i>Every story has a beginning.</i>

49:13.492 --> 49:15.035
<i>My story begins here.</i>

49:20.374 --> 49:22.793
<i>And there was you.</i>

49:24.252 --> 49:25.420
I'm sorry.

49:27.255 --> 49:29.800
<i>You were radiating, and your name was…</i>

49:34.054 --> 49:36.431
You can call me Hannah.

49:36.515 --> 49:40.227
I want to study

49:40.310 --> 49:45.357
at the Berlin University of the Arts.

49:46.983 --> 49:47.984
Thank you.

49:48.610 --> 49:50.779
Who is next? Introduce yourself.

51:43.934 --> 51:46.019
Did you talk to Ju-yeong?

51:46.102 --> 51:49.189
They did fight,
but they made up before parting ways.

51:49.272 --> 51:50.398
That's how kids are.

51:54.110 --> 51:57.030
Do you really think Li-sa bullied her?

51:57.948 --> 51:59.032
What did Li-sa say?

51:59.741 --> 52:01.284
I don't know. She's upset with me.

52:01.368 --> 52:04.329
She thinks I believe Ms. Gu and not her.

52:04.412 --> 52:07.290
Ms. Gu was hired through
the vice principal's recommendation.

52:09.334 --> 52:10.377
Recommendation?

52:10.460 --> 52:14.214
Apparently, the vice principal's daughter
used to work with her at the same school.

52:14.297 --> 52:15.382
They did?

52:19.886 --> 52:22.264
-Which school?
-Why?

52:23.723 --> 52:25.892
-I want to meet with her.
-In person?

52:25.976 --> 52:26.893
Yes.

52:28.895 --> 52:30.230
I think I should.

52:45.203 --> 52:47.330
Ms. Gu? Yes.

52:47.831 --> 52:49.833
I recommended her to my dad.

52:49.916 --> 52:52.085
Were you two close?

52:52.752 --> 52:55.338
No, not really.

52:55.922 --> 52:57.632
I still don't get it.

52:59.009 --> 53:01.219
But I was supposed to go
to Taerim Middle School.

53:02.721 --> 53:03.889
Sorry?

53:03.972 --> 53:07.809
Ms. Gu had been appointed
as a full-time teacher here,

53:09.519 --> 53:11.438
and I'd failed to get my contract renewed.

53:13.356 --> 53:15.817
When she heard that I was going to Taerim,

53:15.901 --> 53:18.236
she said she was going
to quit this school.

53:20.322 --> 53:24.826
So you're saying
Ms. Gu suggested it first?

53:28.830 --> 53:32.208
<i>I told her it was a temporary position,
but she didn't mind.</i>

53:32.709 --> 53:35.921
<i>I was just grateful,
so I asked my dad for a favor.</i>

53:36.880 --> 53:38.340
<i>Is there a problem?</i>

54:07.160 --> 54:08.703
After we met yesterday,

54:09.454 --> 54:12.874
I felt bad about Li-sa
and watched the video again.

54:18.630 --> 54:20.757
I'm scared of myself.

54:21.925 --> 54:26.471
I could see myself turning into a monster.

54:29.307 --> 54:30.767
You have to believe me.

54:31.768 --> 54:35.021
I feel terrible
for what I did and how I hurt Li-sa.

54:35.730 --> 54:38.984
I'm willing to do anything
to make up for it.

54:39.067 --> 54:40.235
I mean it.

54:42.696 --> 54:44.447
I'm truly sorry.

54:53.123 --> 54:55.333
DIRECTOR AN HYEON-SEONG

55:05.593 --> 55:08.596
<i>The nurse said a woman named Hannah
came with papers and requested</i>

55:08.680 --> 55:10.598
<i>the hospital to discharge him.</i>

55:44.841 --> 55:46.051
I'm so sorry.

55:48.178 --> 55:49.095
You…

55:50.221 --> 55:52.140
Why did you approach me?

55:53.391 --> 55:54.309
What?

55:57.353 --> 56:01.357
You even harassed Li-sa.
What did you come here for?

56:22.045 --> 56:23.421
What do you mean?

56:25.256 --> 56:26.508
That's strange.

56:28.593 --> 56:30.887
What makes you think that?

56:57.872 --> 56:59.374
PRICE: 577,500 WON

57:07.090 --> 57:08.466
PRICE: 658,000 WON

57:14.973 --> 57:15.932
Yes?

57:17.559 --> 57:19.727
What's the matter? I told you it's on me.

57:20.520 --> 57:21.980
What is it?

57:22.063 --> 57:24.482
SPECIAL DISCOUNT

57:44.002 --> 57:47.547
It's for your wedding shoot.
You should've gotten something nicer.

57:47.630 --> 57:49.883
The original price was
more than 300,000 won.

57:49.966 --> 57:51.176
We got a really good deal.

57:51.801 --> 57:54.262
I've never shopped
at a place like that before.

57:54.345 --> 57:56.639
It's so fun.
I'm afraid it might become a habit.

58:07.108 --> 58:10.236
I don't know if you'll like it,
but I got the thickest one

58:10.320 --> 58:13.072
since I'm sure
it's quite chilly in Germany.

58:14.199 --> 58:15.575
Hui-ju.

58:15.658 --> 58:18.203
I wanted to get you a nicer one,

58:18.286 --> 58:20.663
but I figured you wouldn't accept it.

58:20.747 --> 58:23.374
This is worth
two months of my lunch money.

58:24.834 --> 58:26.377
I bet it's warm.

58:48.441 --> 58:50.318
You finally look like a bride.

58:51.236 --> 58:54.697
Thank you for the photo shoot.
I bet it's expensive here.

58:54.781 --> 58:57.742
Yes. I purposely picked this place
to make you feel the pressure.

58:59.702 --> 59:02.664
I still don't get
why you're rushing the wedding.

59:04.332 --> 59:06.000
Look at you smiling.

59:09.045 --> 59:10.922
What's taking him so long?

59:11.005 --> 59:12.632
He's never on time.

59:24.394 --> 59:25.436
Hey.

59:30.858 --> 59:31.901
How do I look?

59:32.819 --> 59:34.153
You look pretty.

59:35.780 --> 59:37.699
Ma'am, please get ready.

59:37.782 --> 59:38.866
Coming.

59:45.373 --> 59:46.874
Let's begin the shoot.

59:47.750 --> 59:49.502
Okay. One, two.

59:51.170 --> 59:52.922
That's good. One, two.

59:54.924 --> 59:56.718
Shall we take it standing up now?

59:58.011 --> 59:58.970
Here we go.

1:00:02.765 --> 1:00:04.309
Good. Smile.

1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:06.436
Good.

1:00:08.062 --> 1:00:09.230
Good.

1:00:10.815 --> 1:00:11.816
Great.

1:00:12.900 --> 1:00:15.278
Move your right shoulder just a bit.
That's great.

1:00:15.361 --> 1:00:17.447
I'll begin now.

1:00:17.530 --> 1:00:19.407
All right. One, two.

1:00:22.702 --> 1:00:23.995
Loosen up.

1:00:24.621 --> 1:00:26.289
Sir, smile a bit.

1:00:26.372 --> 1:00:27.832
-Okay.
-Good.

1:00:27.915 --> 1:00:30.668
Smile. One, two.

1:00:31.836 --> 1:00:33.296
Smile.

1:00:34.088 --> 1:00:36.007
Good. Now, this is the last one.

1:00:36.090 --> 1:00:37.675
One minute.

1:00:37.759 --> 1:00:39.802
-Hui-ju.
-Yes?

1:00:39.886 --> 1:00:41.304
Come join us.

1:00:41.387 --> 1:00:43.056
No, I'm good.

1:00:44.140 --> 1:00:45.808
But it'd be nice.

1:00:51.272 --> 1:00:52.565
Join us.

1:00:59.822 --> 1:01:02.617
All right. Let's take the photo.

1:01:02.700 --> 1:01:04.661
One, two.

1:01:04.744 --> 1:01:05.662
Oh, right.

1:01:12.502 --> 1:01:14.962
It's too hot to wear it in here.

1:01:15.046 --> 1:01:16.839
Because you bought it for me.

1:01:19.842 --> 1:01:21.636
-I'm ready.
-Look at the camera.

1:01:21.719 --> 1:01:23.971
One, two, three.

1:01:25.264 --> 1:01:27.475
-Can you stand closer?
-Okay.

1:01:27.558 --> 1:01:30.770
Look at the camera. Here we go. One, two.

1:02:57.023 --> 1:02:58.816
<i>Have you ever tried avoiding a dog?</i>

1:02:59.859 --> 1:03:02.653
If you run, it chases after you even more.

1:03:03.613 --> 1:03:06.240
<i>It's useless.
Let's not see each other again.</i>

1:03:06.324 --> 1:03:10.369
Woo-jae really misses you.

1:03:10.912 --> 1:03:13.664
<i>Are you nuts? Stop acting like a fool.</i>

1:03:13.748 --> 1:03:15.625
<i>What are you trying to do?</i>

1:03:15.708 --> 1:03:17.084
