WEBVTT

00:05.839 --> 00:08.967
You guys better get on the road.
You don't want to be late for Comic-Con.

00:10.093 --> 00:11.511
[Lydia] Aw.

00:13.471 --> 00:17.517
Qué  fun. [chuckles]
My granddaughter is dating a box.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.729
Actually, I'm the TARDIS.

00:20.812 --> 00:24.399
Oh! "TARDIS." Elena said
I must never use that word anymore.

00:26.025 --> 00:28.361
Uh, it's from  Doctor Who, Abuelita.

00:28.445 --> 00:32.073
The TARDIS is a time-traveling police box.
I'm dressed as the Fourth Doctor.

00:32.782 --> 00:35.577
Pretty sure people are going to want to
take pictures with us,

00:35.660 --> 00:37.871
which is the ultimate Comic-Con win.

00:37.954 --> 00:40.707
Next to being able to rap in Klingon.

00:42.792 --> 00:46.838
Ay, pobrecita,  you are even more of a nerd
than Elena.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.674
Ah. You guys look great.

00:49.758 --> 00:53.136
And, Alex... [chuckles]
You look so handsome.

00:53.219 --> 00:54.596
It's my first Bar Mitzvah.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.765
I don't want to look like a schlemiel.

00:58.183 --> 01:00.518
Dr. Berkowitz has been
teaching me Yiddish.

01:00.602 --> 01:04.105
The kid's a natural.
I'm  plotzing  with  nachas.

01:06.274 --> 01:09.402
Ay, papito,  I can't believe
it's your first sleepover.

01:09.486 --> 01:13.281
Yeah. Only eight short years after
all my friends had their first sleepover.

01:14.657 --> 01:18.244
Hey! Be thankful that  Abuelita  and I
are being so cool about it.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.329
I vetted the mom.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.414
She was in the Israeli army, super strict.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.291
No guns in the home.
Liquor cabinet's locked.

01:23.374 --> 01:24.417
No large dogs. She gets it.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.213
Okay, I color-coded the panel schedule

01:28.296 --> 01:31.466
so we can hit as many as we can
before the  Dungeons & Dragons  session.

01:31.549 --> 01:34.302
Roll a D20, with a plus-five to fun!

01:36.262 --> 01:37.597
Blink twice if you need help.

01:42.185 --> 01:44.145
You're not gonna have time
to talk to each other.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.314
This is our first date, okay?

01:46.397 --> 01:48.775
I really like Syd.
I want them to like me back,

01:48.858 --> 01:51.611
so I packed our day full of stuff
so I have no time to be awkward.

01:51.694 --> 01:53.738
That's what's so brilliant
about this schedule.

01:53.822 --> 01:54.781
We never have to talk.

01:54.864 --> 01:55.782
Mmm.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.284
Talking is a good thing.

01:59.119 --> 02:02.372
I bet you Doctor Who even talks
to his patients.

02:07.001 --> 02:08.211
He's not that kind of doctor.

02:09.587 --> 02:12.382
He is a Time Lord, everybody knows this.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.930
What's your costume?
The Wicked Witch of the East Side?

02:20.223 --> 02:22.600
Don't make jokes about witchcraft.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.562
It's like Santería.
I don't believe in it...

02:26.563 --> 02:28.356
but I respect it.

02:33.987 --> 02:37.198
We're catching  Pagliacci
at the San Diego Opera House.

02:37.282 --> 02:41.161
For some reason,
I've always empathized with sad clowns.

02:42.620 --> 02:43.663
[sighs]

02:45.498 --> 02:48.084
You guys gotta get moving. Let's go!

02:48.167 --> 02:50.295
Come on! I have so much studying to do.

02:50.378 --> 02:53.006
I'm gonna miss you guys,
but you gotta beat the traffic,

02:53.089 --> 02:53.923
I gotta hit the books.

02:54.007 --> 02:57.260
Ah, I'm gonna pull an all-nighter,
make those little flashcards.

02:57.343 --> 02:58.636
I'm gonna do some highlighting.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.514
All right,
I'm gonna miss you guys so much!

03:01.598 --> 03:02.724
[breathing heavily]

03:08.605 --> 03:10.648
Okay. Yes.

03:13.776 --> 03:15.111
You look good, girl.

03:16.487 --> 03:17.530
[knocking on door]

03:23.453 --> 03:26.122
Hid in the hallway until your family left,
like a secret agent.

03:26.206 --> 03:29.167
Then I did a shoulder roll.
Didn't have to, just felt cool.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.963
Maybe I'll meet your family
for real next time.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.507
-Uh, you don't want to meet those people.
-Mmm.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.302
How about for now,
you just say hi to the girls?

03:40.178 --> 03:42.931
I thought you had a son and a...
Oh.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.850
-[both laugh]
-[Penelope] Mmm.

03:46.517 --> 03:48.519
Wait, hold on.

03:49.437 --> 03:51.189
-Okay, let's go.
-[laughing]

03:51.981 --> 03:53.566
[both moaning]

03:54.192 --> 03:55.360
[both breathing heavily]

04:00.365 --> 04:02.367
[grunting] No.

04:04.285 --> 04:05.745
That's my mom's room.

04:05.828 --> 04:09.832
There's crosses, pictures of the Pope,
and my dad's ghost's in there.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.336
It's not a sexy place.

04:14.003 --> 04:15.588
[helicopter blades whirring]

04:17.006 --> 04:17.840
What's that?

04:21.135 --> 04:25.306
Oh! It's just a police helicopter.
Otherwise known as Echo Park in July.

04:25.473 --> 04:27.684
[both chuckle]

04:27.767 --> 04:30.770
[officer over speaker]  We're in pursuit
of a dangerous suspect. He is armed.

04:30.853 --> 04:34.148
Everyone, go back inside,
and do not leave your building.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.485
Think your family made it out?

04:37.568 --> 04:39.237
-[Lydia grunts]
-[Penelope gasps]

04:39.320 --> 04:40.196
Lupe!

04:41.406 --> 04:43.783
There is a murderer running loose.

04:43.866 --> 04:45.785
Get in there.

04:45.868 --> 04:48.329
Okay, coming! [panting]

04:49.580 --> 04:53.251
Coming! Yeah. Okay!

04:53.334 --> 04:56.671
Oh, you guys are back.
Great, great, great, great, great.

04:56.754 --> 04:59.590
There's a police helicopter out there.
They're not letting us leave.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.968
-Why do you look so nice?
-Oh, this?

05:02.051 --> 05:04.887
This is what I wear when you aren't here.
You just never see it.

05:05.930 --> 05:08.808
I have never been more proud of you.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.686
[theme song playing]

05:59.734 --> 06:03.488
[officer over speaker]  For your safety,
please remain inside until further notice.

06:03.571 --> 06:04.739
[helicopter blades whirring]

06:04.822 --> 06:07.367
We're going to miss the masquerade
and the dance party.

06:07.450 --> 06:10.495
And the  Firefly  panel, the Zombie Run,
the  Buffy  sing-a-long,

06:10.578 --> 06:12.455
and the super-gay  Supergirl  meet up.

06:15.333 --> 06:19.545
But this lockdown is awesome.
Maybe it's the Daleks.

06:19.629 --> 06:22.590
"Exterminate. Exterminate."

06:24.050 --> 06:27.136
Actually, this seems like
a pretty serious situation.

06:27.970 --> 06:30.515
But it's okay.
We'll just hang out and talk.

06:30.598 --> 06:34.185
[chuckles] Talk? Yeah.

06:34.268 --> 06:38.981
Wait. Keep the costumes on,
and go up to Schneider's.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.651
He's a man-child
who lives off his parents,

06:41.734 --> 06:45.071
and likes dressing up in weird outfits.
He is Comic-Con.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.616
I think we're gonna be stuck here
for a while.

06:49.117 --> 06:52.495
-[Lydia sighs]
-I'm sorry we're going to miss the opera.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.622
Let me see if I can get a refund
on our tickets.

06:54.705 --> 06:56.582
Hey, hey! Why are you going in here?

06:56.666 --> 07:00.378
Because it's where you make me live
like a dog without a door.

07:04.590 --> 07:08.177
Actually,  Mami,  why don't you make
everyone something to eat?

07:08.261 --> 07:10.555
There are over three people,
and no one is cooking.

07:10.638 --> 07:12.014
What kind of Cuban are you?

07:13.891 --> 07:15.768
That's true.  Mala cubana.

07:18.938 --> 07:22.275
Hey, kids, why don't you go
to your rooms and wait until dinner?

07:22.358 --> 07:23.901
-Cool.
-[chuckles]

07:24.318 --> 07:27.280
You want us to be alone in my room?
Me and my date?

07:27.363 --> 07:30.450
Leave the door open. Feet on the ground.
Alex will check on you.

07:30.533 --> 07:31.534
-No, ew.
-Come on.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.917
[Lydia screams]

07:40.001 --> 07:41.961
[Penelope yelling and panting]

07:42.044 --> 07:44.422
My succulent died!

07:46.048 --> 07:47.467
Oh...

07:50.261 --> 07:51.304
[knock at door]

07:51.387 --> 07:54.348
-Ay,  who is that?
-[stammers] It's probably one of those

07:54.432 --> 07:56.100
shirtless door-to-door salesmen.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.979
[Penelope and Dr. Berkowitz scream]

08:00.980 --> 08:01.981
Hey, guys.

08:03.524 --> 08:05.610
Why are you wearing a gas mask?

08:05.693 --> 08:06.903
Why aren't you?

08:07.487 --> 08:10.948
With all that's going on out there?
Oh, man.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.367
Now, look, I prepared us a survival kit.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.246
It's a little bare-bones.
Water purification pills,

08:17.330 --> 08:21.250
MREs, enough cash to get us
to Cape Verde by boat, just the basics.

08:22.001 --> 08:25.171
[sighs] Anyway, you're safe
now that I'm here.

08:25.254 --> 08:28.382
-We were safe when you weren't here.
-Okay. But can I stay?

08:30.551 --> 08:32.345
I'm all alone up there.

08:32.428 --> 08:34.180
Do you have any idea how scary it is

08:34.263 --> 08:37.058
being a wealthy white man
in a lavish apartment?

08:37.141 --> 08:38.684
[helicopter blades whirring]

08:38.768 --> 08:40.228
I'm a target!

08:41.354 --> 08:43.731
Of course you can stay, Schneider.

08:43.814 --> 08:46.442
Why should this night be different
from any other night?

08:46.526 --> 08:48.611
-[Schneider sighing]
-[speaking Hebrew]

08:49.737 --> 08:50.655
Nailed it.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.617
[whispers] Schneider, come here.

08:56.786 --> 08:57.828
Max is here somewhere.

08:58.579 --> 09:01.332
Unless he's Houdini. Maybe he is,
I don't know him that well.

09:01.415 --> 09:02.875
What are you talking about?

09:02.959 --> 09:05.545
They were supposed to be gone,
and he was just here,

09:05.628 --> 09:07.672
and we were supposed to, you know...

09:09.799 --> 09:11.926
-Oh.
-[exhales sharply]

09:12.510 --> 09:15.054
Shag City got shut down by the po-po.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.809
I can't wait to meet him.

09:19.892 --> 09:23.437
I've been following him on Instagram.
Seems like a super cool dude. Great abs.

09:23.521 --> 09:24.939
[sighs]

09:25.022 --> 09:25.898
I know, right?

09:25.982 --> 09:27.233
[chuckles]

09:27.316 --> 09:31.320
But it's way too soon. Nobody is
meeting him, especially not my mom.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.739
One look at him, bam,
she's sewing me in a wedding dress,

09:33.823 --> 09:35.408
and you'll be my maid of honor.

09:36.951 --> 09:39.078
I would be so honored.

09:41.330 --> 09:45.918
Look, right now our relationship is, like,
the perfect little fantasy.

09:46.002 --> 09:48.546
He hasn't seen me
with zit cream on my face,

09:48.629 --> 09:50.840
and inhaling a bag of Cheetos
like it's nothing.

09:50.923 --> 09:53.092
And I don't know if I want him to.

09:53.175 --> 09:56.429
I just wanna keep climbing him
like a beanstalk, and never reach the top.

09:57.638 --> 09:59.765
That's it. I don't even wanna know
his middle name.

10:00.641 --> 10:01.475
Vernon.

10:06.314 --> 10:07.398
Can I have my shirt?

10:13.571 --> 10:15.323
He looks shorter than I thought.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.119
So, I guess you're stuck with me.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.079
[laughs nervously]

10:24.081 --> 10:27.001
-Oh.  A Wrinkle in Time.
-Yeah, it's stupid.

10:27.084 --> 10:30.046
-It's my favorite book.
-Stupid how much I love it.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.424
You okay, there?

10:34.008 --> 10:35.843
Yeah. I'm just super hungry.

10:38.095 --> 10:39.138
For food.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.853
Uh, how about we be normal...

10:47.480 --> 10:48.731
and get snacks?

10:49.940 --> 10:52.693
-Elena, can you help me?
-Shurbly-burbly.

11:01.827 --> 11:03.829
-What is up with you?
-Nothing.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.248
Oh. Are you "shurbly-burbly"?

11:08.084 --> 11:09.752
Help me make things less awkward.

11:09.835 --> 11:12.380
You're good at talking.
People say you're charming.

11:13.547 --> 11:14.423
People are right.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.426
I'll work some magic.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.596
Just because I'm missing the Bar Mitzvah
doesn't mean I can't be a mensch.

11:21.514 --> 11:22.348
Okay.

11:23.349 --> 11:24.975
[opera music playing]

11:32.108 --> 11:34.026
Here, quick, Schneider, help me.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.154
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.414
Okay, okay. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.375
[both grunting]

11:54.046 --> 11:56.590
-Just go, just go.
-Go, go, go.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.300
Yes, go. All right. Okay.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.427
-[Lydia screams]
-[Penelope gasps]

12:00.010 --> 12:01.303
Is that the killer?

12:04.098 --> 12:05.266
Leslie, stay behind me.

12:08.144 --> 12:08.978
Wait.

12:10.604 --> 12:12.606
No. No, no, no.

12:13.190 --> 12:15.985
You are too handsome to be a killer.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.029
Thank you?

12:19.864 --> 12:21.991
Who are you?

12:22.742 --> 12:24.452
[stutters] This? Him?

12:25.536 --> 12:28.372
[stammers]
Go ahead and tell them who he is.

12:32.042 --> 12:35.754
This is Max, my sponsor.

12:36.797 --> 12:40.217
From Alcoholics Anonymous.
So, forget I just said his name.

12:41.677 --> 12:43.554
So great to meet you, Max.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.806
Why don't you two head over
to Schneider's apartment?

12:45.890 --> 12:47.057
-Yes!
-Sounds great, Penelope.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.017
It is Penelope?

12:48.100 --> 12:49.810
-Yeah, good guess. Bye.
-Yeah.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.061
[Lydia] No, no, no, no.

12:51.145 --> 12:53.481
Ridiculous. We are in lockdown.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.193
You must stay for dinner.

13:00.571 --> 13:03.115
Okay, Double-A Alex Alvarez
and Syd Vicious coming at you

13:03.199 --> 13:04.533
from hashtag, lockdown.

13:04.617 --> 13:05.951
-See anything?
-[helicopter hovering]

13:06.035 --> 13:09.955
I see a fire escape,
easy access for zombies.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.582
You guys are my witnesses.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.460
Alex, if I get bitten by a zombie,

13:14.543 --> 13:18.672
promise me right now that
you will take me out. Do not let me turn.

13:19.673 --> 13:21.550
I'm not going to do that, Syd!

13:22.134 --> 13:24.762
I won't be Syd anymore!

13:25.763 --> 13:27.306
I'll kill you!

13:34.939 --> 13:36.440
[cell phone rings]

13:36.524 --> 13:38.400
Ooh, they're FaceTiming me
from the Bar Mitzvah.

13:39.193 --> 13:41.153
Yeah, this can't be my background.
I'm out.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.072
Oh, Alex, Alex, wait!

13:46.200 --> 13:47.576
Your brother's really cool.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.537
He peed his pants once.

13:51.038 --> 13:51.872
Recently?

13:51.956 --> 13:53.958
When he was a kid,
but I thought you should know.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.336
Dinner!

13:57.419 --> 14:00.756
Yay! Food! A group activity.
Let's do this!

14:00.839 --> 14:02.716
[music playing over phone speaker]

14:02.800 --> 14:06.720
Dang!  Bubbe  is dancing the Hora
with Cousin Irving.

14:08.597 --> 14:09.557
You guys are Jewish?

14:09.640 --> 14:11.183
[chuckles] No...

14:11.892 --> 14:15.771
Kids, don't be alarmed by this stranger.
This is Schneider's sponsor, Max.

14:15.854 --> 14:17.147
-Okay.
-Hey.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.607
Hey.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.361
Doesn't she make beautiful children?

14:22.444 --> 14:23.821
Mm-hmm.

14:24.572 --> 14:30.953
So, tell me, Max, does she make you
want to, uh, fight a duel in her honor?

14:33.706 --> 14:38.168
I would kill a thousand men...
for the pleasure of her smile.

14:41.797 --> 14:42.923
I like you, Max.

14:47.511 --> 14:49.263
Well, I feel very welcome.

14:49.346 --> 14:51.640
Although this is not what I had planned
for the evening.

14:52.224 --> 14:54.810
Well, I'm sure you can make it up
by doing what you had planned

14:54.894 --> 14:56.729
two times on another night. [chuckles]

14:58.564 --> 14:59.481
Mmm.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.233
Wow.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.944
This is so good.
Did you help cook this, Doc?

15:04.028 --> 15:06.363
As a matter of fact, I did.

15:06.447 --> 15:10.492
Your mom and I, we work well together.
We're like two peas in a pod.

15:10.576 --> 15:14.121
Yes, it was fun. It was like cooking
with one of my sisters.

15:16.123 --> 15:18.334
Just the comparison I was hoping for.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.047
I wish I could cook, but, uh...

15:23.130 --> 15:26.008
Oh, no, you are too busy being a real man.

15:31.805 --> 15:35.309
Oh, you would've been perfect
for a younger me.

15:35.392 --> 15:38.395
But, look, there is one right here.

15:39.813 --> 15:41.690
Actually, I'm more like my dad.

15:45.861 --> 15:50.366
Actually, Lydia, I am seeing someone,
but she's really hard to read.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.243
I don't know if she's serious about me.

15:53.827 --> 15:56.580
She says she just wants to climb me
like a beanstalk.

16:07.758 --> 16:08.968
Drop that loser.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.263
Yeah, man, that is insane!

16:13.347 --> 16:15.140
Who wouldn't want all this?

16:15.641 --> 16:19.436
Those sick tris and strong core,
it's like looking in the mirror.

16:21.188 --> 16:25.150
Yes. Max, you deserve someone
with beauty and brains,

16:25.234 --> 16:28.862
and shares the same passion you have
to help people, like a nurse.

16:29.446 --> 16:32.116
Remind me, honey,
what is it you do every day?

16:34.201 --> 16:36.286
Price one-way flights back to Cuba.

16:42.126 --> 16:46.839
Well, make fun of me all you want,
but every woman needs a man.

16:46.922 --> 16:48.007
-[clears throat]
-[sighs]

16:50.175 --> 16:52.720
Most women need a man.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.681
Someone like my Berto.

16:55.764 --> 16:59.768
Someone who can protect you,
who can kill spiders for you,

16:59.852 --> 17:04.106
who can make passionate love to you
to celebrate the death of a spider.

17:09.403 --> 17:10.362
[Elena sighs]

17:10.446 --> 17:14.616
Abuelita,  come on. You're putting things
in such absolute binary gender terms.

17:14.700 --> 17:18.328
It's reductive and it perpetuates
toxic myths about masculinity.

17:18.412 --> 17:21.040
Yeah, stop perpetrating and stuff.

17:24.293 --> 17:26.170
You look cute on that high horse.

17:26.795 --> 17:28.589
Uh, okay.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.342
Right. Got it.

17:33.969 --> 17:36.889
Thanks so much for dinner
but I'm not really that hungry,

17:36.972 --> 17:39.266
so I'm gonna chill
till the lockdown's over.

17:40.934 --> 17:43.437
They are walking away from my meal?

17:44.938 --> 17:46.315
This is your fault.

17:48.650 --> 17:49.943
[helicopter hovering]

17:50.736 --> 17:51.862
What are you doing out here?

17:52.738 --> 17:55.991
Pretty clear you didn't want me
in the apartment, so...

17:56.075 --> 17:57.367
[Elena sighs]

17:58.660 --> 18:00.496
[grunts and sighs]

18:01.789 --> 18:04.249
-I'm sorry, I just--
-It's cool.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.877
Uh, message received.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.671
What message? What did you receive?

18:10.255 --> 18:11.882
That you aren't into me.

18:12.633 --> 18:15.177
It's okay. I'm cool with being friends.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.804
I don't want to be your friend.

18:17.429 --> 18:20.766
Oh, great. Way to let me down easy.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.061
No, look, it's the opposite.

18:24.853 --> 18:29.149
I like you so much! Like, so, so much.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.067
Yeah?

18:31.360 --> 18:34.071
You have a really weird way of showing it.

18:38.826 --> 18:41.954
I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm doing
and I don't wanna mess this up.

18:42.037 --> 18:43.539
[helicopter blades whirring]

18:45.499 --> 18:47.417
[officer over speaker]
Please go back inside!

18:48.585 --> 18:52.005
Kissing teenagers, please go back inside!

18:52.089 --> 18:53.674
In a minute!

18:59.596 --> 19:01.515
-Don't worry.
-[chuckles]

19:01.598 --> 19:03.475
I'll protect you.

19:04.059 --> 19:07.521
No, I'll protect you.

19:07.604 --> 19:12.985
Oh, because you're the one who
kissed me first, so you're the protector?

19:13.610 --> 19:16.321
-That is so reductive.
-[chuckles]

19:17.656 --> 19:20.075
How about we protect each other?

19:21.869 --> 19:22.786
Deal.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.084
[officer over speaker]  Remain inside.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.336
We have an armed suspect
still in the area.

19:31.712 --> 19:33.213
Wow, they still haven't caught him.

19:33.297 --> 19:36.842
Don't worry. We have a man to protect us.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.096
It's like we're invisible.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.265
I'm glad you're here, too, dude.

19:46.435 --> 19:50.063
That guy breaks in, you could take him.
You're like a male Wonder Woman.

19:52.357 --> 19:53.317
That's your go-to?

19:54.318 --> 19:57.279
Stop scaring everyone, all right?
Nobody's breaking in.

19:57.362 --> 20:00.616
The police will take care of it.
And no one is fighting with anyone.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.326
Your  papi  would!

20:02.618 --> 20:05.162
He once fought a waiter
for stealing a look at me

20:05.245 --> 20:07.414
in the reflection of a spoon.

20:08.916 --> 20:09.875
That's different.

20:09.958 --> 20:13.212
Maybe a million years ago in Havana,
you could get away with that stuff.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.005
That was ten years ago in an IHOP.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.927
Fighting is not the only option.

20:20.010 --> 20:22.638
Whatever happened to running away?

20:23.472 --> 20:25.641
It's a Berkowitz family tradition.

20:26.850 --> 20:29.895
So what, Leslie? It's good to be a coward?

20:29.978 --> 20:32.481
I'm afraid so.

20:33.690 --> 20:36.235
So many of our heroes were cowards.

20:36.735 --> 20:40.489
Aeneas ran away from Troy
and founded Rome.

20:41.573 --> 20:43.200
The Pilgrims fled England,

20:43.283 --> 20:45.953
and all they did was start
a little country called America.

20:47.537 --> 20:50.999
Shaggy and Scooby
always run away from the bad guys.

20:54.628 --> 20:58.298
But then, they solve the damn crime!

20:59.591 --> 21:02.719
The only reason
why you know about a dead hero

21:02.803 --> 21:07.057
is because a live coward
was there to tell his story!

21:12.020 --> 21:16.108
In this case, I think you're right
because that guy out there has a gun.

21:16.692 --> 21:21.238
And that is why I always felt safer
knowing that your  papi  had a gun.

21:23.365 --> 21:24.199
Whoa. Really?

21:24.783 --> 21:28.203
Wait, are you saying there was a gun
in the house while I was growing up?

21:28.287 --> 21:29.913
Oh, well before that.

21:30.706 --> 21:33.250
It was a wedding gift from the Fajardos.

21:34.751 --> 21:37.879
Of course, they wouldn't give us
something from the registry.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.341
Well, I love  Papi,  but that's a mistake.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.719
Guns aren't safe. That's why
we don't have one in this house.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.264
Okay.

21:52.978 --> 21:53.937
Mami.

21:54.730 --> 21:58.859
Why did you say "okay" like that?

22:02.779 --> 22:03.613
Where is it?

22:04.614 --> 22:05.949
Don't know what you're talking about.

22:07.284 --> 22:09.953
There is a little something
in my nightstand.

22:10.537 --> 22:14.207
It's not very big and it certainly
will never replace your father,

22:14.291 --> 22:15.334
but it does the job.

22:24.676 --> 22:26.762
Is it weird that I hope it's a gun?

22:37.981 --> 22:40.317
Dang!  Abuelita's  packing heat!

22:46.907 --> 22:47.866
Mami.

22:54.664 --> 22:57.042
How dare you keep something like this
from me.

22:57.501 --> 22:59.377
Relax, it isn't even loaded.

22:59.461 --> 23:03.799
Your  papi  had it to protect me.
And now, I have it to protect us.

23:04.382 --> 23:05.759
I can't believe this.

23:05.842 --> 23:08.720
For the last decade,
I've been the annoying parent

23:08.804 --> 23:11.139
that asks other parents do they own a gun.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.724
Well, you didn't ask me.

23:15.018 --> 23:17.437
I don't understand
why you are so horrified.

23:17.521 --> 23:18.772
Let me tell you something.

23:18.855 --> 23:24.319
In Cuba, I saw the government
turn against its own people.

23:24.402 --> 23:25.529
We were helpless.

23:26.113 --> 23:30.075
So, it is good to live in a country
that lets you protect yourself!

23:30.158 --> 23:31.576
Now that Victor is gone,

23:31.660 --> 23:34.871
it's only just three women
and a  papito,  all alone!

23:34.955 --> 23:37.332
-[helicopter blades whirring]
-Look what's going on.

23:37.916 --> 23:40.127
Who knows
what terrible thing could happen?

23:40.210 --> 23:43.046
You can justify this any way you want,
but it doesn't matter.

23:44.005 --> 23:48.218
More bad things happen because
you own a gun, not because you don't.

23:48.802 --> 23:52.764
-That is why I hid it away.
-But that's what everybody says, Ma.

23:52.848 --> 23:56.476
"I locked it up. I'm careful.
I know how to use it."

23:56.560 --> 23:58.562
Everybody thinks they're the exception.

23:58.895 --> 24:01.565
But no matter where you hide it,
kids find it.

24:02.482 --> 24:03.900
And accidents happen.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.236
And things that aren't accidents.

24:08.155 --> 24:09.781
We have teenagers in this house.

24:11.366 --> 24:13.410
We have a gay teenager in this house.

24:14.494 --> 24:17.080
We have a veteran with PTS.

24:17.164 --> 24:19.583
This is the last house
that should have a gun.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.008
I didn't think of it that way, Lupita.

24:30.969 --> 24:31.887
I am sorry.

24:34.514 --> 24:36.892
[sighs] It's fine. It's okay.

24:39.311 --> 24:41.313
But we're turning that in to the police,
got it?

24:41.730 --> 24:43.356
Okay, okay.

24:45.358 --> 24:49.821
-We have a gun!
-No,  Mami,  no! No, no! No.

24:53.241 --> 24:54.659
[sighs]

25:00.624 --> 25:03.668
The police station. Tomorrow.

25:04.252 --> 25:05.253
Okay.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.468
We're getting rid of the gun.

25:11.843 --> 25:13.970
Can you put this at your place
until tomorrow morning?

25:14.054 --> 25:15.305
I'll put it in my panic room.

25:18.308 --> 25:20.477
-Why didn't you go there?
-I panicked.

25:22.604 --> 25:23.813
[Penelope sighs]

25:26.483 --> 25:28.318
Heck of a night to meet your family.

25:29.736 --> 25:30.862
And you.

25:33.073 --> 25:35.533
It's a good thing
that we're just casual acquaintances,

25:35.617 --> 25:37.452
otherwise, I'd be pretty embarrassed.

25:38.370 --> 25:41.039
You have nothing to be embarrassed about.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.794
Although, someone did grab
my butt tonight.

25:49.005 --> 25:50.840
It was either your mom or Schneider.

25:53.093 --> 25:54.177
[sighs]

25:54.261 --> 25:57.931
[officer over speaker]  Attention,
the suspect has been apprehended.

25:58.014 --> 26:00.934
You may come out of your homes.
The lockdown is over.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.646
Well, I did it. I got us through this.

26:07.607 --> 26:11.027
So, what do you say, sponsor?
Lunch tomorrow?

26:11.111 --> 26:12.654
Yeah! Sure, dude. Let's do it.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.865
So, should I just get your number
from Penelope or...

26:17.117 --> 26:18.285
Oh, we're really doing this?

26:21.830 --> 26:22.664
All right.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.294
Syd, I'll give you a ride home.

26:27.377 --> 26:30.714
Uh, do you mind if we listen
to  Pagliacci  in the car?

26:31.298 --> 26:34.384
I must warn you,
I weep from start to finish.

26:35.468 --> 26:38.221
That's cool. Nothing can make me
sad right now.

26:38.305 --> 26:39.264
[Elena chuckles]

26:39.347 --> 26:42.225
I will walk you out
to make sure you are safe.

26:42.309 --> 26:44.269
I still have these guns.

26:46.813 --> 26:47.939
You know, Lydia...

26:49.024 --> 26:52.652
I bet ya I could nurse this cactus
back to life.

26:52.736 --> 26:54.654
They say I have quite the green thumb.

26:55.447 --> 26:56.573
Oh?

26:57.407 --> 26:59.367
Nothing dies on my watch.

27:01.453 --> 27:02.787
Oh.

27:07.459 --> 27:10.754
Oh, and goodbye, Max.

27:10.837 --> 27:16.009
And I hope that  idiota  that you are dating
realizes what she has.

27:17.052 --> 27:18.845
Thank you, Lydia. Me, too.

27:23.558 --> 27:25.518
[clicks tongue] Well, I don't know, Max.

27:25.602 --> 27:28.605
I'm sure that girl's more into you
than you think she is.

27:29.189 --> 27:32.359
Maybe invite her over for dinner
Saturday night for Thai food, 7:45,

27:32.442 --> 27:34.736
and wear those boxer briefs
you know she likes?

27:37.030 --> 27:40.075
And if you wanna talk,
I'm sure she'd be down for it.

27:44.871 --> 27:47.874
It's nice meeting you...  idiota.

27:55.173 --> 27:57.717
Mami , I know your secret.

27:58.301 --> 28:01.262
Okay. [chuckles] I was gonna tell you.
I really was--

28:01.346 --> 28:02.472
You're gonna get rid of it?

28:03.390 --> 28:04.224
What?

28:04.307 --> 28:07.310
Your gun. Under the floorboard
in your bedroom.

28:07.936 --> 28:08.895
In the safe.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.693
How do you know about that?

28:15.568 --> 28:19.239
I thought maybe it was Christmas presents.
I figured out the combination, I'm sorry.

28:19.322 --> 28:21.533
-Did you touch it?
-No, I only looked at it.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.334
Okay. [sighs]

28:32.627 --> 28:37.716
Look, I was in the army.
I was trained how to use it.

28:38.174 --> 28:39.134
Not everybody is.

28:41.720 --> 28:42.637
When your  papi  left,

28:42.721 --> 28:45.223
I didn't wanna find ourselves
in a position

28:45.306 --> 28:46.975
where we needed one and didn't have it.

28:47.767 --> 28:51.104
-You always say that's what everyone says.
-But I'm different. I know how...

28:56.067 --> 28:57.193
[sighs]

28:58.153 --> 28:59.279
I'll get rid of it.

29:00.488 --> 29:01.698
Okay. Good.

29:02.782 --> 29:04.033
And that guy? Max?

29:05.076 --> 29:07.829
-What?
-I know he has a girlfriend, but whatever,

29:07.912 --> 29:09.956
-you could take her, Mom.
-[laughs]

29:11.666 --> 29:13.960
Okay. Thanks,  papito.
