WEBVTT

00:01.067 --> 00:02.735
SHORE: Previously on
"The Practice."

00:02.769 --> 00:04.971
FRUTT: To the world
and to the potential jury pool,

00:05.005 --> 00:06.406
you are the man

00:06.439 --> 00:07.741
who murdered
his pregnant wife

00:07.774 --> 00:09.309
and unborn son.

00:09.342 --> 00:10.911
I need you
to start demonstrating

00:10.943 --> 00:12.646
the zeal that comes
with defending

00:12.679 --> 00:14.214
an innocent man.

00:14.247 --> 00:15.882
Daddy!
Hey, baby!

00:15.916 --> 00:18.451
Your client murdered
my sister, Ms. Frutt.

00:18.484 --> 00:20.787
I won't be cooperating much
with his defense.

00:20.821 --> 00:23.790
Do you think your mom
killed herself?

00:23.824 --> 00:25.559
I know my dad
didn't kill her.

00:25.592 --> 00:26.893
He loved her.

00:26.927 --> 00:29.429
So, I think she must have
committed suicide.

00:30.396 --> 00:31.464
FRUTT: Alan, what's up?

00:31.497 --> 00:33.166
Something came up
at Caruthers.

00:33.199 --> 00:34.668
I left.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.269
Now I'm looking
for new employment.

00:36.302 --> 00:38.605
What exactly came up
at Caruthers, Alan?

00:38.639 --> 00:40.541
I embezzled, allegedly.

00:40.574 --> 00:41.675
Alan...
I'm going through

00:41.708 --> 00:43.677
an enormous
character growth.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.112
Just the same.
And I need a break.

00:46.146 --> 00:47.681
WILSON: This agreement
that you had me type up

00:47.714 --> 00:48.949
tantamount
to insurance fraud.

00:48.982 --> 00:50.250
Is that wrong?

00:54.287 --> 00:55.722
SHORE: Why are we whispering?

00:57.057 --> 00:58.491
CARLISLE: She has a headache.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.026
She?

01:00.060 --> 01:01.001
God.

01:01.034 --> 01:02.335
She gets headaches?

01:02.368 --> 01:04.004
And cramps.

01:04.037 --> 01:05.872
Explains a lot,
don't you think?

01:07.207 --> 01:08.908
Sheila...
Alan...

01:10.443 --> 01:11.111
Sheila...

01:12.078 --> 01:13.013
Alan...

01:13.046 --> 01:15.882
I want you to allow me
to settle this case.

01:15.916 --> 01:16.683
No.

01:16.717 --> 01:19.085
Sheila...
Alan...

01:20.220 --> 01:22.956
Assuming you do hear
God's thoughts,

01:22.989 --> 01:25.592
persuading a jury
of that reality...

01:27.628 --> 01:29.362
will be difficult for me.

01:30.096 --> 01:32.032
I win my cases.

01:32.065 --> 01:33.466
I had the highest
winning percentage

01:33.499 --> 01:35.502
of any litigator
in my firm.

01:35.536 --> 01:37.437
They had no right
to fire me.

01:39.773 --> 01:41.441
Sometimes
we need to forgive those

01:41.474 --> 01:43.209
who trespass against us.

01:44.077 --> 01:45.145
Not.

01:48.381 --> 01:50.851
(music playing)

02:26.960 --> 02:30.564
(indistinct chatter)

02:30.597 --> 02:31.565
REPORTER: Are you rolling?

02:31.598 --> 02:32.599
We're on day three

02:32.633 --> 02:33.900
of Bradley Stanfield's

02:33.934 --> 02:35.335
double murder trial.

02:35.368 --> 02:37.938
It's not known when the
prosecution is going to rest.

02:37.971 --> 02:39.405
Sources say--

02:39.439 --> 02:40.541
hey! Damn it.

02:41.842 --> 02:43.109
HYANG: Cause of death,

02:43.143 --> 02:44.377
cyanide poisoning.

02:44.410 --> 02:47.147
And the cyanide entered
Mrs. Stanfield's system

02:47.180 --> 02:49.182
how, Doctor?
Ingestion,

02:49.215 --> 02:51.117
traces found in coffee.

02:51.518 --> 02:53.887
CAMPBELL: Doctor, you're aware
that a suicide note was found.

02:53.920 --> 02:56.122
Ridiculous.
I'm sorry?

02:56.156 --> 02:57.958
Cyanide poisoning,

02:57.991 --> 02:59.359
violent death.

02:59.392 --> 03:01.768
Nobody commits suicide
that way.

03:01.802 --> 03:03.904
Doctor,
did the cyanide come

03:03.937 --> 03:05.739
in liquid or solid form?

03:06.106 --> 03:07.608
Powder.
Powder?

03:08.141 --> 03:10.511
So, one way for it
to have gotten into the coffee

03:10.544 --> 03:11.812
would be for somebody to simply

03:11.845 --> 03:13.814
pour it into her cup,
right, Doctor?

03:13.847 --> 03:15.549
Yes.
And another way,

03:15.582 --> 03:18.151
somebody could have put it
into the coffee grounds.

03:18.184 --> 03:20.186
Isn't that correct, Doctor?
Could happen.

03:20.353 --> 03:24.390
FRUTT: So the poison could have
been put into the coffee

03:24.424 --> 03:27.027
long before,
perhaps days before,

03:27.060 --> 03:28.995
it was bought and consumed
by the victim.

03:29.029 --> 03:30.096
Isn't that right, Doctor?

03:30.130 --> 03:31.865
Could happen.

03:31.898 --> 03:34.200
Doctor,
what can you tell me

03:34.234 --> 03:36.537
about Molly Stanfield's
personality?

03:36.570 --> 03:39.205
Nothing.
Not a psychologist.

03:39.239 --> 03:42.408
Well, Doctor,
suicide goes very much

03:42.442 --> 03:43.810
to the psychology
of the victim.

03:43.844 --> 03:46.146
You're up here trying
to rule out suicide,

03:46.179 --> 03:48.815
and you know nothing
about Molly Stanfield.

03:48.849 --> 03:51.785
You can't rule out suicide,
can you, doctor?

03:54.320 --> 03:56.757
The cause of action
is wrongful termination

03:56.790 --> 03:58.324
under the State's
Employment Practices Act.

03:58.358 --> 04:00.567
We already filed
with the M. C. A. D. to no avail.

04:01.401 --> 04:03.670
When were you fired?
June.

04:03.704 --> 04:06.139
We have a settlement conference
scheduled for 11:00.

04:06.172 --> 04:07.774
Failing settlement--

04:07.808 --> 04:09.342
Excuse me. Could I just
stop you for a sec?

04:09.375 --> 04:10.076
Surely.

04:10.977 --> 04:12.378
Jimmy, I don't mind
you looking at me.

04:12.412 --> 04:14.447
In fact,
I'm even flattered.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.016
But would you mind
keeping each stare

04:16.048 --> 04:18.483
to eight seconds
total in duration?

04:18.519 --> 04:19.553
Anything
longer than that

04:19.586 --> 04:22.088
is just an invasion
of my privacy.

04:23.389 --> 04:25.425
Eight seconds
or less, Jimmy.

04:25.458 --> 04:26.392
Okay?

04:27.060 --> 04:28.061
Sure.

04:29.763 --> 04:31.898
SHORE:
Now, if we don't settle,

04:31.932 --> 04:34.133
I'd like to have you
second-chair the trial.

04:34.167 --> 04:36.002
Your plain folk style
could be an asset.

04:36.035 --> 04:37.571
A lot of jurors today

04:37.604 --> 04:39.272
relate to the
phonetically-challenged.

04:39.973 --> 04:40.907
Excuse me?

04:41.041 --> 04:43.476
I mean that
as a compliment, Jimmy.

04:43.510 --> 04:44.678
You're the everyman.

04:45.111 --> 04:46.780
I'm not a simple person.

04:47.714 --> 04:48.682
I'm very deep.

04:48.715 --> 04:50.450
Yes.

04:50.483 --> 04:52.318
And what
I'd be looking for

04:52.352 --> 04:54.454
is for you to go
to your depths

04:54.487 --> 04:56.322
and say to the jury,

04:56.356 --> 04:57.624
"Not fair."

05:00.093 --> 05:01.467
Can you do that?

05:03.870 --> 05:04.605
One,

05:04.638 --> 05:05.606
two,

05:06.339 --> 05:07.040
three...

05:08.241 --> 05:10.911
A drug overdose is one thing,
but cyanide?

05:11.477 --> 05:13.046
Why not? It's quick.

05:13.079 --> 05:14.815
And violent.
There are headaches,

05:14.848 --> 05:16.683
vomiting,
possible suffocation.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.118
It's an ugly death.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.486
It's not possible Molly
Stanfield wanted to die ugly?

05:20.521 --> 05:22.088
HENKE: I suppose it's possible,

05:22.122 --> 05:24.357
but as I said,
I've never seen it.

05:24.390 --> 05:25.992
Also, the note,

05:26.026 --> 05:27.127
when people leave notes,

05:27.160 --> 05:29.530
typically
it's to provide explanation

05:29.563 --> 05:30.964
or to say goodbye.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.934
Here we have
"I do not choose to live,"

05:33.967 --> 05:36.169
typed, unsigned.

05:36.202 --> 05:37.904
You think the note
was a fake?

05:37.938 --> 05:40.106
Yes.
Scripted by somebody

05:40.140 --> 05:42.909
who wanted us to think
it was a suicide.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.311
Sounds like whoever did this
was pretty sloppy.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.080
Certainly unconvincing.

05:47.113 --> 05:48.682
Or maybe very clever.

05:49.149 --> 05:52.986
Maybe the victim made it
look like a phony suicide,

05:53.019 --> 05:55.155
hoping the police
would suspect

05:55.188 --> 05:56.122
her husband of murder.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.691
I beg your pardon?

05:57.724 --> 05:58.825
STRINGER:
This marriage was marked

05:58.859 --> 06:00.534
by a lot of anger, doctor,

06:00.567 --> 06:01.868
if not hatred.

06:01.902 --> 06:04.237
Isn't it possible
Molly Stanfield

06:04.270 --> 06:06.039
decided to check out

06:06.072 --> 06:08.441
and take her husband
down in the process?

06:08.474 --> 06:10.276
Is that what you think
happened?

06:10.310 --> 06:13.213
Or somebody else
killed her,

06:13.246 --> 06:16.082
knowing the police
always look to the spouse.

06:16.116 --> 06:18.018
Can you positively
rule that out,

06:18.418 --> 06:20.120
that somebody else
killed her?

06:20.854 --> 06:22.188
Let me put it this way.

06:22.889 --> 06:25.526
Who besides my client
did you investigate?

06:30.664 --> 06:32.966
You can't be willing
to take this to trial.

06:32.999 --> 06:33.934
Oh, but we can.

06:33.967 --> 06:35.401
She was terminated
for a disability.

06:35.435 --> 06:36.837
That's against the law.

06:36.870 --> 06:39.405
GINSBERG: She was terminated
for not being able to fulfill

06:39.439 --> 06:41.041
the function
of the job.

06:41.074 --> 06:44.244
One such function
being client relations.

06:44.444 --> 06:47.213
She claims God talks to her,
for God's sake.

06:47.247 --> 06:49.883
She claims bald men
access her thoughts.

06:49.916 --> 06:51.184
You seem upset.

06:51.217 --> 06:52.553
GINSBERG: I am upset.

06:52.586 --> 06:54.755
We're wasting
valuable time here.

06:54.788 --> 06:56.757
How can you be willing to go
forward with this?

06:56.790 --> 06:58.759
She will be
publicly revealed

06:58.792 --> 06:59.760
as a loon,

06:59.793 --> 07:01.201
which you are, Sheila.

07:01.502 --> 07:02.669
SHORE: May I speak
off the record?

07:02.703 --> 07:04.971
As recently
as five months ago,

07:05.005 --> 07:07.207
you, Mr. Lambert,
and my client

07:07.240 --> 07:08.909
had rather vigorous
sexual relations.

07:08.942 --> 07:10.243
Do you recall that,
Mr. Lambert?

07:11.778 --> 07:12.779
Do you, Sheila?

07:13.179 --> 07:14.047
Vividly.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.116
What is this,
an extortion attempt?

07:16.149 --> 07:18.151
Oh, extortion
is a very bad thing.

07:18.184 --> 07:19.385
I would never.

07:19.886 --> 07:21.054
However--

07:23.557 --> 07:24.257
Mmm.

07:24.290 --> 07:26.159
One of my
favorite words--

07:26.192 --> 07:27.761
"however."

07:27.794 --> 07:28.929
Don't you like that word?

07:28.962 --> 07:30.363
Love it.

07:30.396 --> 07:31.665
However,

07:31.698 --> 07:33.867
I would have to introduce
this carnal episode

07:33.900 --> 07:36.236
as an admission
on Mr. Lambert's part,

07:36.269 --> 07:37.738
that he considered
my client to be both

07:37.771 --> 07:40.206
competent and sane.

07:40.541 --> 07:42.042
How do you figure that?

07:42.643 --> 07:45.045
Well, Mr. Ginsberg,
certainly if he had relations

07:45.078 --> 07:46.980
with a person who,
to his mind,

07:47.013 --> 07:49.249
lacked capacity to consent
to said relations--

07:49.282 --> 07:51.217
what's the word
I'm looking for now?

07:51.251 --> 07:51.952
Heavens?

07:52.285 --> 07:52.986
Rape.

07:53.386 --> 07:54.387
In Massachusetts,

07:54.420 --> 07:56.256
having sex
with the incompetent--

07:56.289 --> 07:56.990
was it "heavens?"

07:57.023 --> 07:58.692
Rape.

07:58.725 --> 07:59.926
Right.

08:01.802 --> 08:05.171
GINSBERG: You're now using
the threat of a criminal trial

08:05.205 --> 08:07.641
to advance a civil claim,
Mr. Shore.

08:07.674 --> 08:09.442
That's grounds
for disbarment.

08:09.475 --> 08:10.811
I don't believe
I did that.

08:11.812 --> 08:13.246
But why don't you go
report me,

08:13.279 --> 08:14.948
see how it all unfolds?

08:19.352 --> 08:21.922
$2.6 million, gentlemen,

08:21.955 --> 08:23.023
that's your out.

08:27.961 --> 08:28.995
SHEPARD:
I wanna see my niece.

08:29.129 --> 08:30.363
When the meeting is over,
they will come out.

08:30.396 --> 08:32.298
I am that child's
guardian.

08:32.332 --> 08:34.900
Actually, her father
is still the legal guardian,

08:34.934 --> 08:35.969
and it's my understanding

08:36.001 --> 08:37.470
you want him convicted.

08:37.871 --> 08:39.172
If you interfere
with our defense,

08:39.205 --> 08:41.207
what you'll be doing
is giving him grounds

08:41.241 --> 08:42.609
for a new trial.

08:42.643 --> 08:43.943
I don't think
you want that.

08:45.646 --> 08:47.080
Now, please.

08:47.113 --> 08:48.214
Sit over there and wait

08:48.248 --> 08:49.550
while I check
on your niece.

08:52.252 --> 08:53.419
(sighs)

08:56.089 --> 08:57.591
All right.

08:57.624 --> 08:59.593
First, this Shore guy

08:59.626 --> 09:01.234
is totally corrupt.

09:01.267 --> 09:03.303
Second,
the client is nuts.

09:03.336 --> 09:04.971
She thinks God
talks to her.

09:05.005 --> 09:06.172
Excuse me?

09:06.206 --> 09:08.842
She also thinks bald men
access her thoughts.

09:08.875 --> 09:11.177
And if you stare at her
more than eight seconds,

09:11.211 --> 09:12.679
you invade her privacy.

09:12.713 --> 09:16.416
And Shore, he just tried
extorting the lawyer.

09:16.449 --> 09:17.483
He's a crook.

09:17.518 --> 09:18.852
(door opens)

09:23.156 --> 09:24.124
SHEPARD: Come on, honey.

09:24.157 --> 09:25.058
Christine.

09:27.594 --> 09:29.963
Listen, I know
you're not sympathetic

09:29.996 --> 09:30.897
to our case here.

09:30.931 --> 09:32.699
You're using
a 10-year-old girl

09:32.733 --> 09:34.668
as a trial prop.

09:34.701 --> 09:36.603
How could anyone
be sympathetic to that?

09:36.637 --> 09:40.073
If you try to interfere
with Emma's involvement,

09:40.106 --> 09:42.375
we will assert our rights
against you.

09:46.913 --> 09:47.948
Come on, honey.

09:50.083 --> 09:51.585
Come on.

09:55.889 --> 09:56.923
You're calling
the daughter?

09:57.791 --> 09:59.225
I don't know.

09:59.259 --> 10:00.166
All she has to say

10:00.200 --> 10:02.035
is that her mother
seemed sad.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.672
We're thinking about
accusing Christine.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.073
Her? The sister?

10:07.107 --> 10:08.374
She has no alibi.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.511
They didn't get along.

10:10.544 --> 10:12.145
Basically,
we've got nothing else.

10:12.178 --> 10:14.748
Ellenor!
I think I can sell it.

10:16.382 --> 10:18.318
Are you out of your mind?

10:18.351 --> 10:19.553
It's called plan "B."

10:19.586 --> 10:22.989
We use it on occasion
when plan "A" is sure to fail.

10:23.657 --> 10:24.925
What about
Emma's testimony?

10:24.958 --> 10:26.092
She'll support suicide.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.562
None of us feel
Emma will help us.

10:28.595 --> 10:31.031
In fact, we think trying
to exploit her further

10:31.064 --> 10:32.232
could even hurt.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.437
Well, my testimony--
And we don't think

10:37.470 --> 10:38.605
you should testify either.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.406
There's too much
to impeach you with.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.475
Right now,
your domestic assault

10:42.509 --> 10:43.844
isn't in evidence.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.512
If you testify, Bradley,

10:45.546 --> 10:47.113
it comes into play.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.082
What is our defense?

10:49.115 --> 10:50.817
Reasonable doubt.

10:51.451 --> 10:52.919
All we need to show

10:52.953 --> 10:54.921
is that it's possible

10:54.955 --> 10:56.256
somebody else did it,

10:56.289 --> 10:58.091
including, possibly,

10:58.124 --> 10:59.560
your sister-in-law.

11:03.369 --> 11:04.905
We know it's desperate.

11:04.938 --> 11:06.039
We're not kidding
ourselves.

11:06.072 --> 11:08.041
But it's something,
Bradley.

11:17.518 --> 11:19.753
We do not commit blackmail
in this firm.

11:19.786 --> 11:21.855
We do not resort
to extortion

11:21.888 --> 11:23.423
or any other
criminal offenses

11:23.456 --> 11:24.691
to settle our claims.

11:24.725 --> 11:27.327
Eugene,
I give you my word.

11:27.360 --> 11:29.863
I would never get caught.

11:33.534 --> 11:35.068
I will report you

11:35.101 --> 11:37.804
to the bar myself.

11:50.250 --> 11:52.085
Jimmy, I brought you in
on this case

11:52.118 --> 11:53.987
because I sensed
a connection between us.

11:55.221 --> 11:56.256
You brought me in

11:56.289 --> 11:58.324
because you think
I'm simple.

11:58.358 --> 12:01.301
"Simple"
would be speaking directly

12:01.334 --> 12:03.537
with the person
you have issues with, Jimmy.

12:03.570 --> 12:05.539
Going behind my back,

12:05.572 --> 12:07.641
that makes you complicated.

12:10.376 --> 12:13.313
You're no longer invited
to play on my team, Jimmy.

12:21.722 --> 12:24.591
SHEPARD: My sister
was a devout Catholic.

12:24.625 --> 12:26.827
Suicide is considered
against God.

12:27.327 --> 12:28.529
She also was not a woman

12:28.562 --> 12:30.831
to indulge in self-pity.

12:30.864 --> 12:32.432
Nothing kept that woman down,

12:32.465 --> 12:34.000
no matter what the setback.

12:34.034 --> 12:36.703
Could she have privately
been unhappy?

12:36.737 --> 12:38.038
No.

12:38.071 --> 12:39.472
If anything,

12:39.506 --> 12:41.141
she seemed happier lately.

12:41.642 --> 12:42.909
She was in love.

12:43.910 --> 12:44.845
In love with?

12:44.878 --> 12:46.079
She had a boyfriend.

12:47.013 --> 12:47.781
I didn't approve,

12:47.814 --> 12:49.115
but I was at least hopeful

12:49.149 --> 12:51.084
that it would get her
out of her involvement

12:51.518 --> 12:52.185
with him.

12:53.319 --> 12:54.054
Him?

12:54.888 --> 12:56.456
You observed your sister
with him?

12:56.489 --> 12:57.190
SHEPARD: Yes.

12:58.124 --> 12:59.726
It was increasingly
more and more angry

12:59.760 --> 13:01.902
to the point that I felt
that it was extremely unhealthy

13:01.935 --> 13:02.603
for Emma.

13:04.170 --> 13:06.540
Clearly, it turned out to be
unhealthy for Molly, as well.

13:07.574 --> 13:10.476
You said
she was a devout Catholic.

13:11.678 --> 13:12.546
Are you?

13:13.046 --> 13:14.280
Yes, I am.

13:14.314 --> 13:15.415
Is it possible,

13:15.448 --> 13:16.583
knowing how opposed

13:16.617 --> 13:18.552
you were to suicide,

13:18.585 --> 13:20.754
that your sister
concealed her plans

13:20.787 --> 13:21.855
to take her life?

13:21.888 --> 13:24.024
This was not a suicide,

13:24.057 --> 13:26.192
and I am finding this repulsive.

13:26.226 --> 13:27.093
You seem angry.

13:27.127 --> 13:28.261
I am.

13:28.294 --> 13:30.063
You and your sister
often got angry

13:30.096 --> 13:31.264
with each other, didn't you?

13:31.297 --> 13:33.800
We had our differences,

13:33.834 --> 13:35.468
primarily over the war zone

13:35.502 --> 13:36.937
they subjected Emma to.

13:36.970 --> 13:38.639
FRUTT: Just out of curiosity.

13:39.940 --> 13:41.642
Where were you
the day your sister died?

13:42.108 --> 13:43.276
I beg your pardon?

13:43.309 --> 13:44.244
FRUTT: I don't mean to be rude,

13:44.277 --> 13:46.312
but if my client
should be convicted

13:46.346 --> 13:47.480
of this murder,

13:47.514 --> 13:49.282
he'd be disqualified
from inheriting,

13:49.315 --> 13:51.885
and you'd get more of your
sister's money, wouldn't you?

13:51.918 --> 13:54.821
Are you suggesting
I killed my sister?

13:54.855 --> 13:56.990
FRUTT: I am just suggesting
that you had keys to her house,

13:57.023 --> 13:58.925
that you knew
her coffee-drinking patterns.

13:58.959 --> 14:01.001
Did the police
ever investigate you?

14:01.034 --> 14:02.235
No, they did not.

14:02.268 --> 14:04.905
A year ago, you tried
to get custody of Emma,

14:04.938 --> 14:06.239
because you considered
your sister

14:06.272 --> 14:07.340
to be an unfit parent.

14:07.373 --> 14:08.909
SHEPARD: I considered them
both unfit,

14:08.942 --> 14:10.644
because of the way
they fought continually

14:10.677 --> 14:11.344
in front of Emma.

14:11.377 --> 14:13.246
You love Emma very much.

14:13.279 --> 14:15.315
SHEPARD: Like a daughter.
Yes, I do.

14:15.348 --> 14:16.850
FRUTT: And if your sister dies

14:16.883 --> 14:19.119
and your brother-in-law
gets convicted of this crime,

14:19.152 --> 14:21.487
you would get custody of Emma,

14:21.522 --> 14:22.689
wouldn't you, Christine?

14:22.723 --> 14:24.691
Everything would work out.

14:25.491 --> 14:26.960
You are disgusting.

14:32.899 --> 14:34.835
(clears throat)

14:34.868 --> 14:35.836
One dollar?

14:36.169 --> 14:37.704
Yes, Mr. Shore,

14:37.738 --> 14:39.540
that is our offer,

14:39.573 --> 14:40.707
one dollar.

14:40.741 --> 14:41.474
And it's final.

14:42.475 --> 14:43.944
We were offended

14:43.977 --> 14:46.947
by your little extortion
attempt yesterday.

14:46.980 --> 14:49.449
And we're perfectly willing
to go to trial on Thursday,

14:49.850 --> 14:51.317
and when we do,

14:51.351 --> 14:52.185
it's gonna get out

14:52.218 --> 14:54.187
that your client is insane.

14:54.688 --> 14:56.056
Her peers are going to learn

14:56.089 --> 14:58.625
that she is deeply,
deeply deluded,

14:58.659 --> 15:01.535
and she will likely
be unemployable forever.

15:01.902 --> 15:03.737
So go ahead, Mr. Shore.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.572
Advise your client
to move forward

15:05.606 --> 15:06.940
with this claim.

15:06.973 --> 15:08.909
Counsel her that it is

15:08.942 --> 15:10.911
in her best interest
to do so.

15:10.944 --> 15:13.346
And you,

15:13.379 --> 15:15.649
why don't you
just talk it over with God?

15:15.682 --> 15:17.383
Let me tell you something.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.355
Mr. Ginsberg,

15:22.388 --> 15:24.658
what you've done,

15:24.691 --> 15:27.027
unwittingly or not,

15:27.060 --> 15:28.662
is turn the matter,

15:30.531 --> 15:31.732
personal.

15:34.635 --> 15:36.703
When a case
becomes personal to me,

15:36.737 --> 15:38.204
Mr. Ginsberg,

15:38.238 --> 15:40.273
my priorities shift.

15:41.975 --> 15:44.110
My goal becomes not so much

15:44.144 --> 15:45.478
to vindicate,

15:45.512 --> 15:47.280
but rather to avenge.

15:50.216 --> 15:52.452
My mission now

15:53.453 --> 15:55.756
is to get you.

16:00.567 --> 16:03.570
(music playing)

16:06.272 --> 16:07.641
The meeting is over.

16:07.674 --> 16:08.542
You may go.

16:16.983 --> 16:18.384
Blessed are the merciful,

16:18.418 --> 16:20.286
for they will be shown mercy.

16:20.621 --> 16:22.388
Blessed are the meek,

16:22.422 --> 16:24.490
for they will possess the land.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.426
Blessed are those who hunger

16:26.459 --> 16:28.662
and thirst for justice,

16:29.095 --> 16:31.097
for they will get their fill.

16:34.535 --> 16:36.336
Rest?

16:36.369 --> 16:37.604
What about my testimony?

16:37.638 --> 16:39.940
We agreed
you shouldn't testify since--

16:39.973 --> 16:42.509
I never agreed.
You agreed.

16:42.543 --> 16:43.877
If you take the stand,

16:43.910 --> 16:46.580
your domestic assault
comes into evidence.

16:46.613 --> 16:48.582
And if I don't go up there,
we have no defense.

16:48.615 --> 16:50.617
FRUTT: Our case
is reasonable doubt.

16:50.651 --> 16:52.152
It's burden of proof.

16:52.185 --> 16:54.688
We've already established
the possibility of suicide.

16:54.721 --> 16:56.122
We've established
the possibility

16:56.156 --> 16:57.724
of somebody else killing her.

16:58.424 --> 17:00.166
That's the best
we can do here.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.367
No, it isn't.

17:01.702 --> 17:02.636
If you take the stand,

17:02.669 --> 17:04.470
you are guaranteed a guilty--

17:04.805 --> 17:05.771
You listen to me.

17:06.807 --> 17:08.541
From my perspective,
I've already bought

17:08.575 --> 17:10.143
the guilty verdict.

17:10.175 --> 17:12.613
I do not want to rest.

17:12.646 --> 17:14.047
If you get--
BRAD: I'm talking.

17:15.781 --> 17:17.250
Like you said from the start,

17:17.282 --> 17:19.419
everyone thinks I'm guilty.

17:19.452 --> 17:21.722
I'm the sick bastard
who killed his pregnant wife

17:21.755 --> 17:23.189
and unborn child.

17:23.523 --> 17:25.458
Well, people need to hear
from me now.

17:25.491 --> 17:27.993
My daughter needs
to hear from me.

17:28.028 --> 17:30.063
Then do it behind
closed doors.

17:30.096 --> 17:31.565
I will do it in that room.

17:37.470 --> 17:40.440
I have made a life
out of being liked, Ellenor.

17:41.575 --> 17:43.544
Look at my face.

17:43.577 --> 17:45.579
Every job I've gotten,

17:45.612 --> 17:47.514
every woman--

17:47.548 --> 17:50.116
it's 'cause I'm trustworthy.

17:50.150 --> 17:50.951
I'm sympathetic.

17:50.984 --> 17:53.286
I make a favorable impression.

17:53.319 --> 17:55.589
STRINGER: Brad,
I agree with Ellenor.

17:55.622 --> 17:57.691
You testifying
would not be a good idea.

17:58.491 --> 18:00.366
I will take that stand,

18:00.400 --> 18:03.236
and I will make
a favorable impression.

18:03.269 --> 18:04.971
I will tell my story,

18:05.005 --> 18:07.307
and they will cry for me.

18:07.340 --> 18:08.509
You understand me?

18:13.013 --> 18:14.781
We understand you perfectly.

18:22.288 --> 18:24.357
I'm actually really excited
about the trial.

18:25.559 --> 18:27.427
There's no greater rush
of adrenaline.

18:27.894 --> 18:29.863
And I'm looking forward
to working together again,

18:29.896 --> 18:30.897
you and me, too.

18:30.931 --> 18:32.132
I thought we gelled perfectly

18:32.165 --> 18:33.634
at that first settlement
conference.

18:33.667 --> 18:34.935
You know,
our rhythms were together.

18:34.968 --> 18:36.202
It was kind of like sex.

18:44.878 --> 18:46.913
What do you think about me
presenting the open?

18:46.947 --> 18:48.715
There's no better way
of showing off my skills

18:48.749 --> 18:49.650
as a litigator.

18:50.116 --> 18:51.818
Did you get a message
just then...

18:52.986 --> 18:53.954
from God?

18:53.987 --> 18:56.089
As a matter of fact,
I did.

18:56.122 --> 18:56.890
Why?

18:57.958 --> 18:59.292
I was just wondering.

18:59.826 --> 19:02.603
So, what do you think
about me opening?

19:02.636 --> 19:04.538
I think it sounds good.

19:04.571 --> 19:05.506
Okay.

19:05.539 --> 19:06.573
SHORE: Listen, I need to meet

19:06.607 --> 19:08.008
with your doctors tomorrow.

19:09.342 --> 19:10.010
Why?

19:10.376 --> 19:12.045
To prepare their testimony.

19:12.078 --> 19:13.580
Why would we be calling doctors?

19:15.015 --> 19:17.984
We're basing our claim
on disability law.

19:18.018 --> 19:20.086
So, I'll need to present
evidence of--

19:20.120 --> 19:22.255
My disability?
I have none, Alan.

19:25.592 --> 19:27.961
When I try cases, Sheila,

19:27.994 --> 19:29.863
I don't like surprises.

19:29.896 --> 19:32.098
Therefore, I would like to meet
with your doctors.

19:32.132 --> 19:33.667
Well, I'll give you
all the surprises right now.

19:33.700 --> 19:35.201
I have no doctors.

19:37.538 --> 19:39.472
You're not being treated
by anybody?

19:39.506 --> 19:40.641
CARLISLE: Why should I be?

19:40.674 --> 19:42.743
Because God speaks to me?

19:42.776 --> 19:44.244
That doesn't make me ill,

19:44.277 --> 19:46.479
and it doesn't make me
any less of a lawyer.

19:52.953 --> 19:54.420
I thought I'd have meat.

19:54.454 --> 19:55.722
I'm on the Atkins diet,

19:55.756 --> 19:58.124
so let's bring on the protein.

20:06.139 --> 20:07.608
SARAH (OVER TV):
In what certainly promises

20:07.641 --> 20:10.010
to be the most dramatic moment
of the trial,

20:10.043 --> 20:12.946
Brad Stanfield will sit
in the witness chair

20:12.979 --> 20:14.380
and presumably deny

20:14.414 --> 20:16.416
that he killed
his pregnant wife, Molly,

20:16.449 --> 20:18.451
and their unborn son, Michael.

20:18.484 --> 20:19.686
(knock on door)

20:19.720 --> 20:20.420
SHORE: You called, Eugene?

20:20.453 --> 20:21.354
Yes.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.791
I wanted to meet our new client.

20:25.191 --> 20:26.392
Ah.

20:26.426 --> 20:27.761
Sheila? Oh.

20:28.829 --> 20:31.665
Sheila Carlisle, Eugene Young.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.433
Why is she hiding behind you?

20:33.466 --> 20:34.568
You're bald, Eugene.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.202
You can access her thoughts.

20:38.238 --> 20:40.006
May I have a word with you,
please, Alan?

20:40.040 --> 20:41.441
Certainly. Sheila?

20:41.474 --> 20:42.142
CARLISLE: Uh-hmm.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.713
Are you serious
about trying this case?

20:47.280 --> 20:47.948
Quite.

20:48.782 --> 20:50.917
The woman thinks
God speaks to her?

20:51.217 --> 20:52.385
She does.

20:52.418 --> 20:53.386
YOUNG: As senior partner,

20:53.419 --> 20:54.888
I'm directing you
to either settle

20:54.921 --> 20:56.056
or enter your withdrawal.

20:56.089 --> 20:58.825
This firm cannot
and will not proceed to court

20:58.859 --> 21:00.300
with that cause of action.

21:00.333 --> 21:01.735
May I respond?

21:01.768 --> 21:03.303
Please.

21:04.605 --> 21:06.006
The client merely thinks

21:06.039 --> 21:07.473
you can access her thoughts

21:07.508 --> 21:09.209
because of your baldness,
Eugene,

21:09.543 --> 21:10.911
but if I'm not mistaken,

21:10.944 --> 21:11.645
you're not bald.

21:11.678 --> 21:12.979
You shave your head.
If I may?

21:17.150 --> 21:18.018
Just as I thought,

21:18.051 --> 21:19.485
nubs.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.822
It's all a big misunderstanding.

21:21.855 --> 21:23.189
I'll let her know.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.258
You do not amuse me.

21:26.392 --> 21:27.493
I sense that.

21:32.298 --> 21:34.200
It wasn't a perfect marriage.

21:35.335 --> 21:37.738
I had an affair once.

21:37.771 --> 21:39.840
Turns out she was having one.

21:39.873 --> 21:41.808
FRUTT: But, still,

21:41.842 --> 21:43.209
you didn't want a divorce.

21:43.243 --> 21:44.177
BRAD: No.

21:44.210 --> 21:46.813
We had a daughter.

21:46.847 --> 21:48.414
For both Molly and me,

21:49.950 --> 21:50.951
Emma was everything.

21:52.753 --> 21:54.120
And...

21:54.955 --> 21:55.956
And what, Brad?

21:56.489 --> 21:58.191
And despite our battles,

21:59.860 --> 22:02.168
my love for Molly
was as strong as ever.

22:03.169 --> 22:05.371
I resisted the divorce

22:05.405 --> 22:08.141
simply 'cause I couldn't imagine
life without her.

22:09.242 --> 22:11.712
That may make me weak, but...

22:11.745 --> 22:13.046
it's the truth.

22:13.647 --> 22:15.081
Did you kill your wife,
Bradley?

22:15.381 --> 22:16.683
No, I didn't.

22:18.885 --> 22:21.788
She was pregnant with my son,

22:21.822 --> 22:23.590
a son I had dreamed of.

22:24.457 --> 22:26.159
The idea that I could take
a life--

22:26.192 --> 22:27.561
any life--

22:30.163 --> 22:31.598
but...

22:31.632 --> 22:33.800
to accuse me
of killing Molly

22:34.868 --> 22:36.102
or Michael?

22:37.904 --> 22:38.872
FRUTT: You heard it mentioned

22:38.905 --> 22:41.007
that your sister-in-law,
Christine,

22:41.041 --> 22:43.610
might have had both motive
and opportunity.

22:43.644 --> 22:46.613
I can't believe Christine
could be capable of this.

22:46.647 --> 22:48.114
She and Molly had battles,

22:48.148 --> 22:49.916
and I know
she wanted custody of Emma,

22:49.950 --> 22:52.753
but this was her own sister.

22:52.786 --> 22:54.988
Did Molly have
any other enemies?

22:55.021 --> 22:57.457
I mean, obviously,

22:57.490 --> 22:58.458
she had secrets.

22:58.491 --> 22:59.593
I didn't know
about the affair,

22:59.626 --> 23:01.367
but...

23:01.401 --> 23:03.036
no enemies that I knew of.

23:03.069 --> 23:04.671
FRUTT: Brad,
you have to understand

23:04.705 --> 23:06.840
why you're a suspect.

23:06.873 --> 23:08.609
You have a troubled marriage,

23:08.642 --> 23:10.143
your wife wants to leave you,

23:10.176 --> 23:12.212
and she's suddenly found
poisoned to death

23:12.245 --> 23:14.080
in your home

23:14.114 --> 23:17.050
with no signs of anybody else
being there but you.

23:18.719 --> 23:21.187
I would never be capable

23:21.221 --> 23:24.057
of taking a human life.

23:24.090 --> 23:26.660
I could never hurt the woman

23:26.693 --> 23:28.595
that I love more than life.

23:30.463 --> 23:32.833
You could never hurt her.

23:32.866 --> 23:35.235
A year ago, the police
were called to your house once

23:35.268 --> 23:36.870
because you hit her.

23:36.903 --> 23:38.972
Once, during an argument,

23:39.005 --> 23:40.907
I lashed out.

23:40.941 --> 23:41.708
I'm ashamed of that.

23:41.742 --> 23:43.677
You're ashamed.

23:43.710 --> 23:45.278
And when the police
questioned you

23:45.311 --> 23:47.380
after finding her dead,

23:47.413 --> 23:49.650
you didn't tell them
of your affair,

23:49.683 --> 23:50.684
did you?

23:50.717 --> 23:51.552
No. I was--

23:51.585 --> 23:52.418
Ashamed?

23:52.452 --> 23:53.820
Objection.

23:53.854 --> 23:55.155
CAMPBELL: The police asked
if you and your wife

23:55.188 --> 23:56.422
had any domestic problems.

23:56.990 --> 23:59.292
You answered, "No."

23:59.325 --> 24:01.568
That was a lie,
wasn't it, Mr. Stanfield?

24:01.602 --> 24:03.704
I didn't imagine
that I was a suspect

24:03.737 --> 24:06.406
at the time
of that question.

24:06.439 --> 24:08.241
I thought my marriage
was a private matter.

24:08.274 --> 24:09.409
I see.

24:09.442 --> 24:11.144
You also told the police

24:11.177 --> 24:12.345
that you tried

24:12.378 --> 24:14.347
to revive your wife.

24:14.380 --> 24:16.182
Yes, after I found her, I...

24:16.216 --> 24:18.519
performed chest compressions,
mouth-to-mouth.

24:18.552 --> 24:21.187
CAMPBELL: Yes, you said
you tried to breathe air

24:21.221 --> 24:23.089
into her lungs.

24:23.123 --> 24:25.191
And yet we found no traces

24:25.225 --> 24:26.593
of your saliva on her mouth.

24:26.627 --> 24:28.061
In fact,

24:28.094 --> 24:30.396
there was no smudging
even of her lipstick,

24:30.430 --> 24:31.431
Mr. Stanfield.

24:33.734 --> 24:35.435
Did you not touch her lips

24:35.468 --> 24:37.638
as you performed mouth-to-mouth?

24:38.839 --> 24:39.640
I thought I did.

24:39.673 --> 24:41.207
You thought you did?

24:42.475 --> 24:44.277
The night before Molly's death,

24:44.310 --> 24:46.146
neighbors heard you
and your wife

24:46.179 --> 24:48.982
screaming at each other
from inside your home.

24:49.015 --> 24:50.951
What was the fight about,
Mr. Stanfield?

24:50.984 --> 24:53.587
We argued a lot
in our marriage.

24:53.620 --> 24:56.256
I said so.

24:56.289 --> 24:57.924
That particular argument,

25:00.300 --> 25:02.202
she complained
that I worked too much,

25:02.235 --> 25:04.437
that I was an absentee husband.

25:04.470 --> 25:06.339
That's what the fight was about?

25:06.372 --> 25:07.273
Yes.

25:07.307 --> 25:09.576
One neighbor, Martin Reed,

25:09.610 --> 25:10.977
who is seated right there

25:11.612 --> 25:14.247
he heard you screaming
at your wife,

25:14.280 --> 25:16.049
"Do you love him?"

25:17.818 --> 25:19.686
Did she love who,
Mr. Stanfield?

25:19.720 --> 25:21.755
I do not recall saying that.

25:21.788 --> 25:24.625
You stated to the police
and testified again today

25:24.658 --> 25:26.359
that you didn't learn
of your wife's affair

25:26.392 --> 25:28.662
until after her death,

25:28.695 --> 25:30.697
and yet the night before,

25:30.731 --> 25:32.265
you were heard screaming,

25:32.298 --> 25:34.434
"Do you love him?"

25:35.201 --> 25:36.803
As I said before,

25:36.837 --> 25:39.372
I don't remember saying that.

25:39.405 --> 25:41.341
I knew nothing about her affair.

25:49.850 --> 25:50.651
WILSON: (sighs) Not good.

25:50.684 --> 25:51.852
How bad?

25:51.885 --> 25:52.986
All six voted guilty,

25:54.354 --> 25:55.556
unequivocally.

25:56.590 --> 25:58.224
What are you talking about?

25:58.258 --> 25:59.726
FRUTT: I hired a focus group

25:59.760 --> 26:01.868
to monitor the trial.

26:01.902 --> 26:03.904
They found your testimony
unconvincing,

26:03.937 --> 26:06.339
and unanimously rejected it.

26:07.708 --> 26:09.676
FRUTT: All right, look,

26:10.777 --> 26:12.546
I would like to explore
murder two.

26:13.446 --> 26:15.215
Absolutely not.
Brad--

26:15.248 --> 26:17.150
BRAD: That is a life sentence,
Ellenor.

26:17.183 --> 26:18.885
With a possibility
of parole.

26:18.919 --> 26:20.186
I don't know what to tell you.

26:20.220 --> 26:21.922
We are going to lose here.

26:21.955 --> 26:23.056
We are dead.

26:23.089 --> 26:24.257
EMMA: Daddy, let me tell.

26:24.290 --> 26:25.992
BRAD: Emma, please be quiet.

26:26.026 --> 26:26.927
Daddy, you said you--

26:26.960 --> 26:27.861
Emma?

26:32.733 --> 26:33.900
Tell what?

26:34.267 --> 26:35.902
Nothing. Could--

26:35.936 --> 26:37.871
can I have a moment alone
with my daughter, please?

26:37.904 --> 26:40.006
(music playing)

26:51.351 --> 26:52.018
Hey.

26:52.252 --> 26:53.153
Hey.

26:53.186 --> 26:54.220
I'm working on my opening.

26:54.254 --> 26:55.055
You wanna hear it?

26:55.088 --> 26:56.757
In a second.

26:58.358 --> 26:59.960
I need you
to listen to me, Sheila.

26:59.993 --> 27:01.067
Yeah?

27:03.069 --> 27:05.105
The reason I so readily
took this case,

27:05.138 --> 27:06.607
aside from my...

27:06.640 --> 27:08.609
tremendous affection for you,

27:09.710 --> 27:11.978
is because I know,

27:12.012 --> 27:13.914
your eccentricities
notwithstanding,

27:13.947 --> 27:15.448
you've always been a fierce

27:15.481 --> 27:16.783
and brilliant litigator,

27:17.383 --> 27:19.485
and I have never,
ever known you

27:19.520 --> 27:22.122
to be off on the law.

27:22.155 --> 27:23.456
But I'm concerned, Sheila,

27:25.692 --> 27:27.728
because now...

27:27.761 --> 27:29.996
you are off on the law.

27:30.030 --> 27:31.097
How so?

27:35.602 --> 27:38.371
The basis of our claim

27:38.404 --> 27:41.474
lies in employment
discrimination--

27:41.508 --> 27:44.444
Massachusetts General Laws,
chapter 151.

27:44.477 --> 27:46.412
You drafted the complaint,
Sheila.

27:46.446 --> 27:49.282
We must, as a matter of law,

27:49.315 --> 27:52.052
make a showing
that you're handicapped

27:52.085 --> 27:54.454
within the meaning
of the statute.

27:56.056 --> 27:58.925
We will need a doctor to testify

27:58.959 --> 28:01.001
that you have a mental illness,

28:01.034 --> 28:02.102
because you do.

28:04.671 --> 28:06.907
And if we cannot make a showing

28:06.940 --> 28:09.342
that you are mentally ill,

28:09.375 --> 28:11.512
we cannot win this lawsuit.

28:18.919 --> 28:20.286
What are your thoughts?

28:25.025 --> 28:26.660
Talk to me.

28:26.693 --> 28:28.795
Please don't abandon me, Alan.

28:29.362 --> 28:30.463
I won't.

28:34.367 --> 28:36.069
(clears throat)

28:36.102 --> 28:38.772
I was initially diagnosed
with schizophrenia.

28:38.805 --> 28:41.374
I had excellent
pre-morbid functioning.

28:41.407 --> 28:42.876
I was later re-diagnosed

28:42.909 --> 28:45.512
with a non-bizarre
delusional disorder--

28:45.546 --> 28:47.413
delusional
and not schizophrenic,

28:47.447 --> 28:49.149
because the voices
were within my head

28:49.182 --> 28:51.051
and not from external sources.

28:51.084 --> 28:54.054
I was treated
with antipsychotic medication.

28:54.087 --> 28:55.589
The voices remitted.

28:55.622 --> 28:57.924
I went off the medication,
and...

28:59.560 --> 29:01.134
she came back.

29:01.167 --> 29:02.335
There you have it.

29:02.368 --> 29:04.404
I'll make the doctors
available to you,

29:05.706 --> 29:08.041
though I haven't been treated
in over two months.

29:17.718 --> 29:19.553
I'll let you get back
to your opening.

29:23.056 --> 29:23.890
Alan...

29:26.527 --> 29:28.762
I need you
to win this case for me.

29:28.795 --> 29:30.664
Can you win it for me, please?

29:31.665 --> 29:32.699
Done.

29:43.644 --> 29:46.346
FRUTT: We know you love
your dad very much,

29:46.379 --> 29:47.581
and he loves you.

29:47.614 --> 29:48.715
We're his lawyers,

29:48.749 --> 29:51.718
and all of his secrets
are safe with us.

29:53.153 --> 29:55.789
Are you the person
who poisoned your mother?

29:58.291 --> 30:01.568
I told you I don't really
wanna talk about it right now.

30:01.602 --> 30:02.435
Emma...

30:03.303 --> 30:06.139
I don't think
you really want your dad

30:06.172 --> 30:08.575
to live the rest of his life
in prison.

30:08.609 --> 30:11.144
FRUTT: There may be a way
for us to help him

30:11.177 --> 30:13.847
and to protect you
at the same time,

30:14.515 --> 30:16.717
but we need to know

30:16.750 --> 30:17.984
the truth, Emma.

30:19.052 --> 30:21.187
Did you poison your mother?

30:24.891 --> 30:25.792
(crying)

30:31.331 --> 30:32.799
Can you tell us why?

30:34.400 --> 30:36.336
She was ruining everything.

30:40.607 --> 30:42.108
She's lying to protect me.

30:42.442 --> 30:43.610
I don't think so.

30:44.010 --> 30:44.978
Where is she?

30:45.011 --> 30:47.280
She's with Tara.

30:47.313 --> 30:49.249
Listen--
I killed Molly.

30:50.383 --> 30:51.585
All right?

30:52.786 --> 30:53.987
Look, Emma's just trying
to protect me.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.088
Leave it at that.

30:55.421 --> 30:58.258
Oh, so, now you're suddenly
saying that you did it?

30:58.725 --> 31:00.634
You've been protecting
your daughter.

31:00.667 --> 31:02.402
This doesn't help her.

31:02.435 --> 31:03.870
She's 10.

31:03.904 --> 31:04.938
She'll be destroyed--

31:04.971 --> 31:06.306
BRAD: She'll most definitely
be destroyed

31:06.339 --> 31:07.508
if she's locked up.

31:07.541 --> 31:10.010
That doesn't have to happen.

31:10.043 --> 31:11.878
There's probably
an insanity defense.

31:11.912 --> 31:12.946
She's 10.

31:12.979 --> 31:14.214
Plus, for God's sake,

31:14.247 --> 31:16.382
if she's ever to have any chance

31:16.416 --> 31:18.284
of psychological
or emotional health,

31:18.318 --> 31:20.521
she's gonna need you
on the outside.

31:20.554 --> 31:22.789
You accepting guilt
for her crime--

31:22.823 --> 31:23.790
I accept guilt

31:23.824 --> 31:26.459
because I'm at fault, Ellenor.

31:30.864 --> 31:34.334
She was raised
in an environment of hatred.

31:35.869 --> 31:38.104
Her mom and I fought.

31:38.138 --> 31:39.239
Emma...

31:43.376 --> 31:46.012
whatever caused her to do this,

31:47.447 --> 31:50.450
I absolutely accept fault.

31:54.621 --> 31:57.123
Let us try to work this out.

31:59.292 --> 32:01.334
Just make the deal
on murder two.

32:01.367 --> 32:02.402
I'll take it.

32:02.769 --> 32:04.304
We're not allowed to do that.

32:04.337 --> 32:06.640
As Emma's legal guardian,

32:06.673 --> 32:09.943
I am directing you to hire
independent counsel for her.

32:09.976 --> 32:11.344
That you have to do.

32:15.015 --> 32:17.918
She's a gifted attorney,

32:17.951 --> 32:19.853
and I mean gifted.

32:21.187 --> 32:24.057
She has the highest
winning percentage

32:24.090 --> 32:26.259
of all our litigators.

32:26.960 --> 32:30.564
But God speaks to her.

32:30.597 --> 32:34.701
She claims bald men
access her thoughts.

32:35.869 --> 32:38.438
As much as we adore
Sheila Carlisle,

32:38.471 --> 32:39.673
and we do,

32:41.207 --> 32:42.275
she's ill,

32:43.276 --> 32:46.146
and her delusions simply...

32:46.179 --> 32:47.447
shake...

32:47.480 --> 32:50.517
client confidence in our firm.

32:51.017 --> 32:53.419
Now, you'll hear lots
of evidence during this trial

32:53.453 --> 32:56.690
from many people
documenting her illness,

32:56.723 --> 32:59.292
and you'll understand
our position.

32:59.325 --> 33:01.868
But you'll truly come
to appreciate it,

33:01.902 --> 33:03.036
I'm afraid,

33:04.170 --> 33:06.573
once you hear from Sheila.

33:19.920 --> 33:22.756
Imagine being considered insane

33:22.789 --> 33:24.991
for endeavoring
to communicate with God.

33:26.326 --> 33:27.761
I've been so ostracized

33:27.794 --> 33:29.763
by my firm these days,

33:29.796 --> 33:32.566
God was the only one
who talked to me.

33:33.934 --> 33:35.569
You talk to her, Margaret,

33:35.602 --> 33:37.203
every night,

33:37.237 --> 33:39.039
and though you think
She's a He,

33:39.540 --> 33:40.774
that's okay.

33:42.375 --> 33:44.477
And, Ward, I know
you don't believe in her,

33:44.511 --> 33:46.747
but when your wife
survived cancer,

33:47.180 --> 33:48.448
you were heard to mutter,

33:48.481 --> 33:49.883
"Thank God."

33:52.152 --> 33:53.319
GINSBERG:
What is going on here?

33:53.353 --> 33:55.121
I'm giving my opening remarks,

33:55.155 --> 33:57.123
and I'd appreciate
being allowed to finish.

33:58.191 --> 34:00.601
And this is fraud.

34:00.634 --> 34:01.434
Objection!

34:01.467 --> 34:02.669
Agnostic, Mitchell?

34:03.403 --> 34:04.304
Shame.

34:04.337 --> 34:07.774
Ms. Carlisle, Chambers, now.

34:09.042 --> 34:09.976
Just as well.

34:10.010 --> 34:11.244
Shirley has to pee.

34:13.146 --> 34:15.014
GINSBERG: Obviously,
she managed to find

34:15.047 --> 34:17.150
personal data on the jurors.

34:17.183 --> 34:18.451
This is unethical.

34:18.484 --> 34:20.320
Where did you get
this information, counsel?

34:20.353 --> 34:21.154
God.

34:21.187 --> 34:22.288
SPINDLE: I'm not fooling around,

34:22.322 --> 34:23.456
Ms. Carlisle.

34:23.489 --> 34:25.190
If you have access
to the clerk's office--

34:25.225 --> 34:27.193
if you gained access
to the files--

34:27.226 --> 34:28.895
GINSBERG: This is probably why
she relates so well to juries.

34:28.929 --> 34:30.797
She gets inside information,
which she--

34:30.831 --> 34:33.433
You're absolutely right,
Albert.

34:33.466 --> 34:35.168
If you'd like a mistrial,
fine.

34:35.201 --> 34:38.071
We can do this
over and over again.

34:38.103 --> 34:40.106
My source
will always be there.

34:40.139 --> 34:41.341
SPINDLE: All right.

34:41.373 --> 34:43.543
Regardless of where
you get your information,

34:43.577 --> 34:44.777
it is improper for you

34:44.811 --> 34:47.047
to have personal contact
with jurors.

34:47.080 --> 34:47.914
I haven't.

34:47.947 --> 34:49.315
SPINDLE: Yes, you have.

34:49.349 --> 34:51.251
The fact that you had it
in open court

34:51.284 --> 34:53.085
doesn't change things.

34:53.119 --> 34:54.254
This is a mistrial.

34:54.286 --> 34:55.922
She told me
that you'd do that,

34:55.956 --> 34:57.457
but I wouldn't listen.

35:00.060 --> 35:01.267
Mr. Ginsberg...

35:02.636 --> 35:05.806
given you don't know her source

35:05.839 --> 35:09.342
and that she might be
more subtle the next go-round,

35:09.375 --> 35:12.513
I seriously suggest
you think about settling this.

35:14.214 --> 35:16.249
Your wife would be happy.

35:16.282 --> 35:18.051
You could take
that trip to Mexico.

35:19.485 --> 35:20.887
They're in a rut.

35:22.789 --> 35:25.491
The cyanide came
from her mother's photo lab.

35:25.526 --> 35:27.961
Evidently, it's used
in developing pictures.

35:27.994 --> 35:30.263
STRINGER: It explains
the simple suicide note

35:30.296 --> 35:32.232
written by a 10-year-old.

35:35.301 --> 35:37.538
I need to talk to her.
I can't allow that.

35:37.571 --> 35:39.472
Look, you're gonna have
to help me out a little here.

35:39.506 --> 35:40.240
Otherwise--
I've been assigned

35:40.273 --> 35:41.341
to help the girl,

35:41.374 --> 35:42.709
not you.

35:42.743 --> 35:44.645
Trust me, she's not talking.

35:44.678 --> 35:46.312
And if I were to subpoena her?

35:46.780 --> 35:48.448
She'll plead the Fifth,

35:48.481 --> 35:49.683
unless, of course,
you'd like to grant

35:49.716 --> 35:50.817
total immunity.

35:50.851 --> 35:52.786
CAMPBELL: Well,
if I can't speak to her,

35:52.819 --> 35:54.420
I have no new evidence,
and therefore, I--

35:54.454 --> 35:55.789
FRUTT: Actually, you do.

35:55.822 --> 35:57.257
Jamie and I are witnesses,

35:57.290 --> 35:59.425
as is Tara Wilson,
our assistant.

35:59.459 --> 36:01.501
We heard the girl confess.

36:01.535 --> 36:03.537
And I'm to take your word?

36:03.570 --> 36:04.738
You represent the guy.

36:04.771 --> 36:06.372
No, actually, we would have

36:06.406 --> 36:07.641
to recuse ourselves now

36:07.674 --> 36:09.510
because we've become witnesses.

36:11.645 --> 36:13.179
Look...

36:13.213 --> 36:14.915
I pull a lot of stunts.

36:14.948 --> 36:16.149
In this trial alone,

36:16.182 --> 36:18.051
pointing the finger
at the sister,

36:18.084 --> 36:19.219
it was a tactic,

36:19.252 --> 36:20.587
a part of the game.

36:22.022 --> 36:22.956
But...

36:22.989 --> 36:24.758
as an officer of the court,

36:24.791 --> 36:26.359
I am here before you now,

36:26.392 --> 36:29.630
as is Jamie, telling you

36:29.663 --> 36:31.932
this was not a stunt.

36:35.736 --> 36:36.803
(knock on door)

36:36.837 --> 36:38.438
(door opens)

36:44.210 --> 36:45.445
Thank you for coming in.

36:46.747 --> 36:48.448
I understand
you've had opportunity

36:48.481 --> 36:49.850
to talk to your niece.

36:51.918 --> 36:54.688
Ms. Shepard, I need you
to be a friend of the court,

36:54.721 --> 36:56.322
and I--
Hold on a second.

36:56.356 --> 36:58.158
WEST: Ms. Singleton,
you represent the girl,

36:58.191 --> 36:59.392
not the aunt.

36:59.425 --> 37:01.367
That's her--
This is improper, Your Honor.

37:01.400 --> 37:02.602
Well, that's my call,
not yours,

37:02.636 --> 37:04.437
and I'll thank you to be quiet.

37:09.108 --> 37:10.009
Ms. Shepard...

37:10.744 --> 37:11.911
none of us...

37:11.945 --> 37:14.914
wants the wrong person
convicted here.

37:14.948 --> 37:16.315
Did your niece

37:16.349 --> 37:19.319
indicate to you
that she poisoned your sister?

37:22.055 --> 37:23.824
I asked you a question.

37:23.857 --> 37:24.958
I would like you to answer.

37:24.991 --> 37:27.293
SHEPARD: I am not going
to incriminate my niece.

37:31.064 --> 37:32.666
But I'll say...

37:37.538 --> 37:40.273
it appears Mr. Stanfield
did not commit the crime.

37:51.317 --> 37:52.586
Members of the jury,

37:52.619 --> 37:54.788
new information
has come to light.

37:55.622 --> 37:57.390
As a result of this
new information,

37:57.423 --> 37:59.793
the District Attorney
feels he is duty-bound

37:59.826 --> 38:01.602
to withdraw the complaint.

38:01.968 --> 38:04.505
The charges against
Bradley Stanfield

38:04.538 --> 38:05.772
are therefore dismissed.

38:06.940 --> 38:08.374
WEST:
The defendant is free to go.

38:09.576 --> 38:11.111
The minor, Emma Stanfield

38:11.144 --> 38:12.546
will be taken into custody,

38:12.579 --> 38:13.980
and we are adjourned.

38:16.316 --> 38:17.283
MAN: Mr. Stanfield.

38:17.317 --> 38:18.719
Try and be brave, sweetheart.

38:18.752 --> 38:20.253
I will, daddy, I will.

38:20.286 --> 38:23.289
(indistinct chatter)

38:29.730 --> 38:31.297
They're not taking you back.

38:31.331 --> 38:32.899
What?

38:32.933 --> 38:34.701
They can't be forced
to employ you, Sheila.

38:34.735 --> 38:35.736
You know that.

38:35.769 --> 38:37.303
Well then let's not settle.

38:37.337 --> 38:38.772
Five is not enough.

38:38.805 --> 38:39.873
You don't need them.

38:41.074 --> 38:44.511
Being alone
is not good for me, Alan.

38:44.845 --> 38:47.648
I need voices
on the outside to balance--

38:47.681 --> 38:49.249
being alone
is not good for me.

38:49.282 --> 38:50.416
Let's not settle.

38:50.450 --> 38:52.318
Nobody's gonna hire you,

38:54.955 --> 38:56.189
except maybe me.

38:57.658 --> 38:58.692
You?

39:00.133 --> 39:00.967
Here?

39:01.001 --> 39:02.335
Why not?

39:02.703 --> 39:04.705
Do you even have the authority
to hire people?

39:04.738 --> 39:05.972
No.

39:06.006 --> 39:07.173
I'll figure it out.

39:09.543 --> 39:11.411
You're a good friend, Alan.

39:13.313 --> 39:15.916
How did you learn
the identities and backgrounds

39:15.949 --> 39:17.317
of all those jurors?

39:18.685 --> 39:19.853
(chuckles)

39:28.929 --> 39:30.531
FRUTT: Brad?
You got a second?

39:31.632 --> 39:34.167
Sure.
Emma's lawyer,

39:34.200 --> 39:35.201
is she qualified?

39:35.869 --> 39:37.638
FRUTT: Well, she was assigned
by the courts.

39:37.671 --> 39:38.872
Her reputation is good.

39:38.905 --> 39:40.240
Can you take over?

39:41.708 --> 39:42.576
Oh, I suppose, but--

39:42.609 --> 39:43.544
Good.

39:43.577 --> 39:44.911
I wanna move quickly.

39:44.945 --> 39:46.312
I don't want her
to be locked up.

39:46.346 --> 39:48.314
She's going to be locked up.

39:48.348 --> 39:49.683
She committed murder.

39:49.716 --> 39:50.817
There's nothing--
Actually, she didn't, Jamie.

39:50.851 --> 39:52.152
She just said she did.

39:54.454 --> 39:55.522
All right, look,

39:56.590 --> 39:57.724
I'm embarrassed to say

39:57.758 --> 39:59.526
I haven't been truthful
with you.

40:00.901 --> 40:02.168
I killed Molly.

40:02.669 --> 40:04.404
I maintained otherwise
for obvious reasons.

40:04.437 --> 40:05.972
I didn't wanna spend my life
in jail.

40:06.206 --> 40:07.541
As the case went south,

40:07.574 --> 40:09.643
Emma and I
devised a backup plan--

40:09.676 --> 40:10.711
plan "B" of our own,

40:10.744 --> 40:11.878
I guess you'd call it.

40:11.912 --> 40:13.880
It involved manipulating you,

40:13.914 --> 40:15.616
getting you to think
that she did it

40:15.649 --> 40:16.883
in the hope that maybe
you'd find a way

40:16.917 --> 40:18.752
to right an apparent
travesty of justice,

40:18.785 --> 40:20.253
which you did,

40:20.286 --> 40:21.487
and I'm grateful.

40:21.522 --> 40:23.156
Now we need to help her.

40:24.525 --> 40:25.626
Assuming double jeopardy

40:25.659 --> 40:27.327
will prevent me
from being retried,

40:27.360 --> 40:29.763
one strategy might be
for me to come forward now

40:29.796 --> 40:31.064
and admit my guilt.

40:31.097 --> 40:32.032
Is that right?

40:33.499 --> 40:35.435
Do I assume correctly,
Ellenor?

40:37.538 --> 40:39.405
You killed your wife?

40:39.540 --> 40:40.774
Yes...

40:40.807 --> 40:42.576
and I'm not proud
of using my daughter

40:42.609 --> 40:44.477
to secure my freedom.

40:44.511 --> 40:46.179
Actually, you two gave me
that idea.

40:46.680 --> 40:48.549
Anyway, the mission now

40:48.582 --> 40:50.551
is to fix things
and get her out,

40:50.584 --> 40:52.452
so we all need to get on board.

40:52.485 --> 40:55.689
Again, I totally apologize
for manipulating you.

40:55.722 --> 40:57.157
I thought that was the only way.

40:58.859 --> 41:00.701
When can we proceed?

41:01.134 --> 41:02.836
Brad...

41:02.869 --> 41:04.605
you're gonna have
to give us a little time

41:04.638 --> 41:07.373
to absorb all of this.

41:07.407 --> 41:09.175
But let's not waste
any time, okay?

41:09.209 --> 41:12.045
An innocent 10-year-old girl
is in jail.

41:12.078 --> 41:14.080
We need to help her.

41:14.114 --> 41:15.616
Whatever we choose to do,
by the way,

41:15.649 --> 41:18.318
it cannot involve me
going to jail.

41:18.351 --> 41:19.586
That is not an option.

41:21.321 --> 41:22.623
Okay.

41:22.656 --> 41:23.890
Thank you.

41:34.034 --> 41:35.569
I think I could be sick.

41:38.038 --> 41:39.205
We need to figure out a way

41:39.239 --> 41:41.274
to take him down.

41:41.942 --> 41:43.243
How?

41:43.276 --> 41:46.446
There's double jeopardy,
privilege.

41:46.479 --> 41:47.280
FRUTT: Jamie...

41:47.681 --> 41:49.950
he just used us as puppets

41:49.983 --> 41:51.685
to defraud the court.

41:54.387 --> 41:56.857
We need to take him down.

42:06.573 --> 42:07.808
(sighs)

42:16.650 --> 42:19.653
(music playing)

42:42.643 --> 42:44.144
WOMAN: You stinker!

42:44.177 --> 42:47.080
(music playing)
