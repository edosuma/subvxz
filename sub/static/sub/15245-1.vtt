00:39.122 --> 00:41.623
At the midpoint on the journey of life,

00:41.750 --> 00:44.251
I found myself in a dark forest,

00:44.377 --> 00:47.296
for the clear path was lost.

00:47.422 --> 00:50.466
I cannot well recount
how I entered the wood,

00:50.592 --> 00:54.428
so long had it been
since I abandoned the true way.

00:55.764 --> 00:59.266
How shall I say what a dreary
and horrid wood it was?

00:59.392 --> 01:03.645
So bitter to endure that death itself
would be but little worse.

01:07.358 --> 01:09.276
Several times upon my journey home,

01:09.402 --> 01:12.529
I had sensed an unseen rider
trailing my steed.

01:12.655 --> 01:15.949
Yet, when I approached, the rider vanished,

01:17.160 --> 01:19.119
leaving no trace.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.956
I feared this figure as an evil omen.

01:23.083 --> 01:27.086
All my life I've known such signs
and portents.

01:32.092 --> 01:35.677
And lo, at the rise of the hill,
I saw a spotted leopard,

01:35.804 --> 01:37.888
all teeth and fury.

01:38.973 --> 01:41.475
At the sight of these beasts,
my heart sank.

01:41.601 --> 01:45.104
I sensed danger not for myself,
but for my beloved Beatrice.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.525
Away, demon!

01:59.994 --> 02:03.372
I drove my steed on,
racing for my father's villa.

02:03.498 --> 02:07.376
And Beatrice... nothing in this world
meant more to me than she.

02:08.252 --> 02:09.752
You were right, Dante.

02:09.878 --> 02:13.423
Truly this is a divine place.
Paradise on Earth.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.635
Beatrice, will you take my hand in marriage,

02:16.761 --> 02:18.929
under God and all that is holy?

02:19.389 --> 02:24.351
Dante, I will not marry you
only to see you dead in this crusade.

02:24.477 --> 02:27.354
Jerusalem must be made Christian
once more.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.606
God is with us. We cannot fail.

02:31.943 --> 02:34.403
Through three years of war and horror,

02:34.529 --> 02:37.364
my love for Beatrice
had only grown stronger.

02:40.493 --> 02:42.703
As I came upon the family estate,

02:42.829 --> 02:45.873
I found all unnaturally dark and still.

02:50.461 --> 02:53.672
Fearing the dreaded omens, I entered.

03:05.351 --> 03:08.061
The servants. All butchered.

03:18.156 --> 03:21.158
Father. Oh, Father.

03:22.076 --> 03:25.621
Beatrice! Lord, let her be alive!

03:28.958 --> 03:31.043
In the name of God.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.880
Where is...

03:35.006 --> 03:36.882
Oh, no. No.

03:37.008 --> 03:39.009
Beloved, are you all right?

03:43.264 --> 03:45.057
Beatrice.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.769
Is it you or a dream?

03:50.063 --> 03:51.438
Who did this to you?

03:51.564 --> 03:53.023
I know not.

03:53.149 --> 03:56.318
A stranger. A foreigner.

03:58.613 --> 04:03.283
Do you remember that night
before you left?

04:03.409 --> 04:04.618
What we said?

04:04.744 --> 04:05.786
I remember.

04:05.912 --> 04:09.623
Did you betray me?

04:12.168 --> 04:13.961
Never.

04:23.137 --> 04:25.430
I never should have left your side.

04:25.556 --> 04:27.432
Forgive me.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.605
What?

04:37.235 --> 04:39.987
Do my eyes deceive me?

04:40.113 --> 04:44.157
Fear not for me, my love.
I told him you would be true to me.

04:45.159 --> 04:47.035
I knew you would.

04:51.708 --> 04:54.543
No! Wait! Come back to me!

04:57.588 --> 04:59.464
What is this?

05:03.094 --> 05:04.636
God in Heaven!

05:04.762 --> 05:06.680
What? Dante?

05:06.806 --> 05:09.266
She is mine.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.059
No!

05:11.769 --> 05:15.647
I have come to take
what was promised me...

05:15.773 --> 05:19.651
a soul meant for Heaven.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.820
It can't be true.

05:21.946 --> 05:24.031
Dante would never betray me.

05:25.199 --> 05:26.533
Beatrice!

05:26.659 --> 05:28.660
Release her, devil!

05:39.255 --> 05:41.340
Dante, help me!

05:42.383 --> 05:44.009
No!

05:53.770 --> 05:57.731
This will not stop me!
Nothing will stop me!

06:03.154 --> 06:04.363
No!

06:14.499 --> 06:16.166
What?

06:16.292 --> 06:18.001
No!

06:18.127 --> 06:20.670
God, give me strength!

06:23.424 --> 06:27.552
Come with me, mortal,
if you have the courage.

06:27.678 --> 06:30.889
Dante, don't let him take me!

06:31.682 --> 06:33.433
Beatrice!

06:37.605 --> 06:41.775
You will not keep me from my beloved!

06:48.825 --> 06:52.869
Dante, you lied to me! I trusted you!

06:52.995 --> 06:56.957
You've got to save me! Dante!

07:00.044 --> 07:03.463
I'm coming for you!
I won't let him hurt you!

07:03.589 --> 07:07.676
Beatrice! No!

07:15.643 --> 07:18.687
- Martyr.
- You lost her.

07:18.813 --> 07:21.606
- Martyr.
- You lied to her.

07:21.732 --> 07:22.691
You lost her.

07:22.817 --> 07:25.026
Never will you know her flesh again.

07:25.153 --> 07:30.031
Never will you know her love.

07:30.158 --> 07:31.116
Her sin.

07:31.242 --> 07:33.577
- Martyr. Martyr.
- You lost her!

07:33.703 --> 07:36.121
- Her desire.
- You lied to her.

07:36.247 --> 07:38.582
- Your sins.
- Never will you know her flesh again.

07:40.751 --> 07:42.294
Your sins.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.754
Never will you know her flesh.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.882
You are bound.

07:47.008 --> 07:50.552
- Martyr.
- You lied to her.

07:50.678 --> 07:53.096
- Martyr.
- Martyr.

07:54.849 --> 07:58.268
Why, God?
Why are you doing this?

07:59.604 --> 08:02.981
It is not the Lord that brought you
to this fate, Dante.

08:05.401 --> 08:08.028
What are you? Shade or living man?

08:08.154 --> 08:11.198
Not man, though once I was.

08:11.324 --> 08:15.202
I lived under Augustus in the time
of the false and lying gods.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.371
Are you not Virgil, glory of the poets?

08:18.498 --> 08:21.249
He who wrote the Aeneid,
the treasure of Rome?

08:21.375 --> 08:23.793
Why do you seek such woe, Dante?

08:23.920 --> 08:26.671
I seek only my beloved Beatrice
and nothing more.

08:26.797 --> 08:30.258
But I cannot open these accursed gates!

08:31.719 --> 08:34.721
Have you lost all faith in God, O man?

08:34.847 --> 08:37.140
Has the way been so obscured?

08:39.393 --> 08:42.562
Heavenly Father,
if only one soul should be saved,

08:42.688 --> 08:45.232
please let it be Beatrice.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.820
Help! Help!

08:57.328 --> 09:02.332
Dante, if you broke your promise to me,
I'll be forever damned.

09:02.458 --> 09:06.795
Are you prepared to be judged in this place?

09:06.921 --> 09:10.131
Do you think you are without sin?

09:10.258 --> 09:12.801
Please, don't let him take me!

09:12.927 --> 09:16.846
Beatrice. Beatrice!

09:51.132 --> 09:54.634
What did Beatrice do
to deserve such a monstrous fate?

09:54.760 --> 09:58.555
She made a wager with Lucifer
to see your safe return.

09:58.681 --> 09:59.848
She lost.

09:59.974 --> 10:01.683
Wager. What wager?

10:01.809 --> 10:04.644
Lucifer bet that you would betray her love.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.563
I never betrayed her.

10:06.689 --> 10:09.482
You only deceive yourself, mortal.

10:09.609 --> 10:13.987
By all that is holy, I vow to forsake
all pleasures of the flesh

10:14.113 --> 10:16.489
until I return from this noble crusade.

10:16.616 --> 10:21.119
I gave myself to you because I know
you will be faithful to our love.

10:22.496 --> 10:25.665
And when I return, we shall be married.

10:25.791 --> 10:29.127
And live to grow old and see
our grandchildren have children.

10:33.132 --> 10:36.092
I love you more than Heaven itself.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.306
- Take this.
- But, Beatrice,

10:41.432 --> 10:44.267
this has been in your family
for generations.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.311
It is a true relic

10:46.437 --> 10:49.522
said to contain a thorn
from the crown of Christ.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.399
Bring it back to me.

10:55.988 --> 10:58.531
Great Virgil, lead me into the Inferno.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.617
I beg of you, please!

11:00.743 --> 11:04.287
I must save Beatrice
even if it means my death.

11:04.413 --> 11:09.376
I will guide you, but you must put aside
all division of spirit

11:09.502 --> 11:12.295
and gather your soul against all fear.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.465
I fear nothing.

11:15.591 --> 11:17.175
Then proceed.

11:22.765 --> 11:27.143
Charon will carry us
to the first circle of Hell, Limbo.

11:27.269 --> 11:29.729
Nine circles comprise the Inferno,

11:29.855 --> 11:32.190
with Lucifer residing in the lowest.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.442
Horrifying, yes.

11:34.568 --> 11:36.236
There are more damned in Hell...

11:36.362 --> 11:38.571
than liberated in Paradise.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.200
I can see their sins in life.

11:45.037 --> 11:48.707
Charon's boat has grown wide
and mighty over the millennia.

11:48.833 --> 11:52.335
He has had to compensate
for the ever-increasing damned.

11:52.461 --> 11:56.005
Through me the way to the city of woe.

11:56.132 --> 12:00.218
Through me the way to everlasting pain.

12:00.344 --> 12:01.720
I don't like the look of this.

12:01.846 --> 12:04.889
Now shall I ferry you into the fire,

12:05.015 --> 12:08.560
the cold and the everlasting darkness.

12:08.686 --> 12:12.605
Abandon hope,
all ye who enter here.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.607
How could God allow this?

12:14.734 --> 12:18.236
God allowed free will, even for his angels.

12:18.362 --> 12:21.698
It was Lucifer that devised such torment.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.908
Mercenaries of Florentina,

12:24.034 --> 12:26.578
in payment for reclaiming
the Holy Land,

12:26.704 --> 12:32.167
your Immaculate Father hereby
absolves you of all your sins.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.335
Go with grace.

12:37.465 --> 12:38.840
Praise God.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.969
Do you think a priest
has such divine power?

12:43.095 --> 12:45.597
Can he truly absolve us of sins so easily?

12:45.723 --> 12:47.098
Of course, Francesco.

12:47.224 --> 12:51.311
Why would you doubt the Church?
That is the path to Hell, my friend.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.104
How soon until you leave?

12:53.230 --> 12:55.774
Tomorrow, before dawn.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.985
Dante, promise to watch over my brother.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.529
Beatrice, I'm no child.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.491
No harm will come to him, my love.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.743
I'll protect him as if he were my own.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.997
You who are living,

13:11.123 --> 13:14.459
be gone from those who are dead.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.461
I will not part, Charon!

13:16.587 --> 13:19.047
I must cross!

13:19.173 --> 13:21.758
I give you my soul to find Beatrice!

13:21.884 --> 13:25.970
It belongs to us already, mortal.

14:12.893 --> 14:15.562
Your will is nothing, mortal.

14:15.688 --> 14:19.315
You will never traverse the circles of Hell.

14:21.735 --> 14:23.903
Take me to Beatrice, demon!

14:57.229 --> 14:59.480
Virgil, where did you disappear to?

14:59.940 --> 15:01.858
I am pure spirit, Dante.

15:01.984 --> 15:05.737
I cannot help you fight your enemies.
I am naught but a guide.

15:30.262 --> 15:34.641
Dante! Can you hear me?

15:35.559 --> 15:38.353
Can anyone hear me?

15:43.484 --> 15:45.568
Dante?

15:45.694 --> 15:48.738
Thank God.
I knew you would find me.

15:48.864 --> 15:50.323
Dante?

15:50.449 --> 15:53.534
Beatrice, my love.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.745
Is... Is that you?

16:01.001 --> 16:03.419
No! Dante!

16:03.545 --> 16:05.964
No, stop! Stop, Dante!

16:17.851 --> 16:20.144
What's happening?

16:20.270 --> 16:23.398
How many ways can a man die?

16:23.524 --> 16:24.565
No!

16:24.692 --> 16:27.068
Come to me, Beatrice.

16:27.903 --> 16:31.406
- I want to admire you.
- No. Let me go.

16:31.532 --> 16:35.368
There is not only suffering in Hell, my love.

16:36.328 --> 16:39.455
There are untold pleasures here,

16:39.581 --> 16:45.086
pleasures your human senses
could not fathom.

16:45.212 --> 16:46.629
Never!

17:00.644 --> 17:06.273
There is nothing you can do
to hurt me, child.

17:06.817 --> 17:12.238
What you perceive of me is a literal shadow
of my former self,

17:12.364 --> 17:14.866
but you...

17:16.242 --> 17:21.873
you can die a thousand deaths by my will.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.174
What?

17:34.261 --> 17:37.055
Think of the tortures I can create

17:37.181 --> 17:42.393
for such a pure, delicate, angelic soul.

17:49.359 --> 17:52.070
Tell me more about your life on Earth,
great poet.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.864
I know your deeds,
but not the man you were.

17:54.990 --> 17:57.658
Publius Vergilius Maro was my name.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.786
I was the son of a commoner,

17:59.912 --> 18:03.289
and though I died a dozen years
before the birth of Christ,

18:03.415 --> 18:05.666
I foretold his coming in my works.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.002
What is this place, Virgil?

18:08.128 --> 18:11.422
The first circle of the Inferno, Limbo.

18:12.007 --> 18:14.175
Here suffer those that did not sin,

18:14.301 --> 18:17.095
yet did not have the required faith.

18:17.221 --> 18:21.849
This is the realm where virtuous pagans
and unbaptized babies reside.

18:29.441 --> 18:32.151
A child? Here?

18:32.277 --> 18:34.278
How can this be?

18:35.697 --> 18:37.532
Dearest Dante.

18:37.658 --> 18:42.537
This is the fourth letter I have written
and the fourth I have destroyed.

18:42.663 --> 18:45.623
I am five months with child.

18:46.458 --> 18:49.585
I fear telling your father
as we have yet to be married.

18:50.504 --> 18:54.257
I do not know how much longer
I can conceal my state.

18:54.383 --> 18:57.718
All I ask is that you return to me soon.

18:57.845 --> 19:01.180
Leave this terrible crusade,

19:01.306 --> 19:04.851
and we... we can be married.

19:13.610 --> 19:15.486
My lady, what is it?

19:15.612 --> 19:17.864
The baby.

19:31.879 --> 19:34.839
This is my son.

19:40.137 --> 19:43.347
Oh, Beatrice, I didn't know.

19:44.516 --> 19:48.060
Come. Quickly, Dante.
This is not a place to contemplate.

19:51.815 --> 19:54.150
What madness is this?

20:11.585 --> 20:14.212
Lord, too many.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.596
Virgil. Virgil!

20:23.722 --> 20:25.640
In here, Dante. Hurry.

20:44.743 --> 20:47.536
What is that sound?
More demons?

20:47.663 --> 20:49.455
No.

20:57.464 --> 20:59.757
They are familiar to me.

20:59.883 --> 21:03.219
The great rulers and philosophers
of the golden age.

21:03.345 --> 21:05.888
Is that not Hector and Electra?

21:06.014 --> 21:07.848
Caesar and King Latinus?

21:07.975 --> 21:10.434
And do not forget Plato,
Socrates and Aristotle.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.228
I have never agreed to such terms.

21:12.354 --> 21:17.066
I say that God exists in the realm of ideas,
accessible to human thought.

21:17.192 --> 21:23.364
Plato, there is only one philosophy
in the Inferno - Lucifer's.

21:23.490 --> 21:27.451
Do not look for liberation here, old friend.

21:28.704 --> 21:31.289
- Do you know this shade?
- He was Saladin,

21:31.415 --> 21:33.124
a noble Kurdish sultan.

21:33.250 --> 21:37.503
I fought his forces in the Crusades
under Richard the Lionheart.

21:43.218 --> 21:46.512
Filthy heretic, Jerusalem is ours.

21:48.432 --> 21:52.101
We will wash these holy lands
in your heathen blood.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.228
Father...

21:55.355 --> 21:58.357
Mercy, noble knight. She's only a child.

21:58.483 --> 22:02.737
Dante! Dante, the forces
of Saladin are routed!

22:02.863 --> 22:04.655
Dante?

22:41.485 --> 22:43.694
My God, what is it?

22:43.820 --> 22:45.696
He is King Minos.

22:45.822 --> 22:47.865
Once a king of Crete

22:47.991 --> 22:51.369
before Daedalus
boiled him in his own bath.

22:51.495 --> 22:55.122
Now, Minos forever judges the damned,

22:55.248 --> 22:58.042
sending them to their circle below.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.669
- Through him...
- Traitor.

23:00.796 --> 23:02.755
...all must pass.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.590
Heretic.

23:05.717 --> 23:07.510
Glutton.

23:08.303 --> 23:10.179
Hoarder.

23:10.305 --> 23:12.098
Suicide!

23:14.017 --> 23:17.311
Who comes into my house of pain?

23:17.437 --> 23:21.148
He who seeks Beatrice.
Let me pass, that I may find her.

23:23.902 --> 23:28.948
Turn back.
There is no place for you here.

23:29.074 --> 23:32.159
Not yet, O mortal.

23:32.285 --> 23:36.038
With your permission or not,
I pass, monster.

23:36.164 --> 23:40.209
You dare so speak
to the judge of the damned?

23:45.841 --> 23:47.425
I dare.

24:15.454 --> 24:19.623
I will judge you to the lowest circle of Hell.

24:21.334 --> 24:24.837
Lucifer shall devour you for eternity!

24:24.963 --> 24:28.757
Silence, Minos. It is his fate to proceed.

25:02.709 --> 25:04.793
Here you must descend.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.800
The damned are trying to flee.

25:11.927 --> 25:14.178
Lucifer will not be pleased.

25:15.180 --> 25:18.557
Let him come.
If these demons can die in the Inferno,

25:18.683 --> 25:20.768
then so can he.

25:42.582 --> 25:44.166
What is this place?

25:44.292 --> 25:47.711
This is the second circle,
the circle of Lust.

25:47.837 --> 25:51.006
To this torment are condemned
the carnal damned.

25:51.132 --> 25:53.092
They are the great lustful of the world.

25:53.218 --> 25:58.973
See there Semiramis and Ninus,
Anthony and Cleopatra,

25:59.099 --> 26:01.517
Helen of Troy and Paris.

26:01.643 --> 26:04.186
The storms of lust forever rage

26:04.312 --> 26:06.647
while passion inflames the heart.

26:09.192 --> 26:12.736
Listen, on the wind.

26:12.862 --> 26:15.573
- Dante, help me.
- Beatrice!

26:15.699 --> 26:17.533
Please, Dante.

26:17.659 --> 26:19.326
Dante.

26:19.452 --> 26:21.996
- Beatrice!
- Dante, hold.

26:22.122 --> 26:23.998
Beatrice!

26:25.584 --> 26:29.003
A new visitor arrives, sisters.

26:30.964 --> 26:34.425
Come, embrace us, Dante.

26:34.551 --> 26:38.846
We know what you want.
We can see it in your eyes.

26:38.972 --> 26:41.640
Unbearable lust.

26:42.684 --> 26:45.894
No, let me pass.
Stand aside, harlot.

26:46.438 --> 26:50.441
If you won't have us, we shall have you!

27:21.556 --> 27:23.766
Dante, how could you let this happen?

27:23.892 --> 27:25.517
How could you betray me?

27:25.644 --> 27:27.645
No, Beatrice. I swear.

27:27.771 --> 27:30.147
What do you swear, Dante?

27:30.273 --> 27:32.983
Do you want me to show her the truth?

27:33.109 --> 27:37.029
Serpent. It's all lies.
I never betrayed her.

27:37.155 --> 27:39.740
I'll kill you!

27:40.825 --> 27:46.497
You can hide from
neither memory nor sin, Dante.

27:50.543 --> 27:55.005
What? King Richard wants us
to stand guard over 3,000 prisoners?

27:55.131 --> 27:56.715
That is his command?

27:57.258 --> 28:00.886
He will negotiate their exchange
for the return of the true Cross.

28:01.012 --> 28:04.181
Negotiate with heretics?

28:04.307 --> 28:08.018
Never! They deserve only damnation.

28:10.980 --> 28:13.065
Get your hands off her.

28:14.109 --> 28:17.778
Infidel scum. We'll show you not to defy us.

28:26.287 --> 28:30.082
Good and noble knights, have mercy.
I beg you!

28:30.208 --> 28:34.294
This prisoner only tried to save me
from the guards.

28:35.296 --> 28:39.341
Please, sir, show compassion.
He is no threat.

28:39.467 --> 28:42.386
He is a heretic.
He gets what he deserves.

28:45.724 --> 28:49.518
Kind lord, if you would show him mercy

28:49.644 --> 28:53.397
perhaps I could give you comfort in return.

28:53.523 --> 28:56.608
What comfort could you give
a soldier of God?

28:59.863 --> 29:03.115
The nights here are lonely and cold,
my lord,

29:03.241 --> 29:06.201
even for a soldier of God.

29:06.327 --> 29:08.120
Perhaps I could warm thee.

29:08.246 --> 29:10.873
Dante, do not commit this wicked sin.

29:10.999 --> 29:13.834
How is it a sin if I am already absolved?

29:13.960 --> 29:15.961
Guards, hold.

29:22.051 --> 29:25.137
Thank you, Lord. You are kind.

29:25.263 --> 29:27.598
I could see it in your eyes.

29:27.724 --> 29:30.142
And your promise of comfort?

29:38.985 --> 29:41.487
How could you do that to me...

29:41.613 --> 29:43.781
to us?

29:43.907 --> 29:46.533
I was weak. The war changed me.

29:46.659 --> 29:50.204
You know who I am inside.
We've known each other since childhood.

29:50.330 --> 29:52.873
Does she know you, Dante,

29:52.999 --> 29:56.794
or did the Crusades show her your true self?

29:57.337 --> 30:00.047
Beatrice! Forgive me!

30:01.633 --> 30:04.051
Please forgive me.

30:06.429 --> 30:11.058
No, it's not true.
He wouldn't do this to me.

30:11.184 --> 30:13.227
Dante!

30:13.353 --> 30:15.103
What did I say?

30:15.230 --> 30:18.732
Even the purest of souls
can be corrupted.

30:18.858 --> 30:22.277
Dante is not the man you once knew.

30:22.403 --> 30:26.490
You did this to him.
You corrupted his heart.

30:27.992 --> 30:30.911
I've had no need to influence humanity

30:31.037 --> 30:33.831
for many millennia, my dear.

30:33.957 --> 30:37.668
I simply introduced sin.

30:37.794 --> 30:42.130
Man is the one who has spread it
like a disease,

30:42.257 --> 30:46.134
cultivating it, empowering it.

30:58.314 --> 31:01.733
It is not our fault, none of it.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.652
Man is good.

31:03.778 --> 31:06.655
No, you don't understand.

31:06.781 --> 31:10.325
The Earth is another form of Hell,

31:10.451 --> 31:13.537
and men are its demons.

31:19.961 --> 31:22.880
I failed her, Virgil. I betrayed her.

31:23.006 --> 31:26.508
I could blame the Crusades,
but I know it was my own weakness,

31:26.634 --> 31:28.093
my own sin.

31:28.219 --> 31:32.055
Have you considered she is not
the only soul you are here to save?

31:34.183 --> 31:36.894
I seek only my beloved Beatrice,

31:37.020 --> 31:38.812
and nothing more.

31:41.274 --> 31:42.733
It is Cerberus,

31:42.859 --> 31:46.862
guardian of the third circle, Gluttony.

32:00.627 --> 32:04.630
That is the foulest fate
one could ever imagine.

32:04.756 --> 32:08.634
And it is your fate as well,
for the true circle of Gluttony

32:08.760 --> 32:11.637
lies inside of Cerberus's body.

32:11.763 --> 32:16.516
Inside? Good Lord, isn't there
perhaps a way around it?

32:16.643 --> 32:20.062
No, not if you wish to reach fair Beatrice.

32:20.188 --> 32:23.774
So be it! For her I will conquer even this.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.984
Face me, wretched creature!

32:29.989 --> 32:32.074
Release me, demon!

32:50.385 --> 32:54.554
Hell can get no more horrible
than this place.

32:54.681 --> 32:57.349
I find this circle most unpleasant.

32:57.475 --> 32:59.935
You're a shade.
You should try wearing skin.

33:00.061 --> 33:02.187
Such a fate. Look at them all.

33:02.313 --> 33:06.108
How could such harmless sin
provoke such everlasting torment?

33:06.234 --> 33:09.903
The gluttons -
what they could not satisfy in life,

33:10.029 --> 33:13.031
in death they shall be denied for eternity.

33:13.157 --> 33:16.284
Dante. Do you remember me, Dante?

33:16.411 --> 33:20.247
I too am from Florence.
You were born before I died.

33:20.373 --> 33:22.165
I do not know you, spirit.

33:22.291 --> 33:25.460
You know me. I am Ciacco.

33:25.586 --> 33:27.421
Gluttony was my offense,

33:27.547 --> 33:30.966
and here I remain
mere skin and bones.

33:31.092 --> 33:34.594
Can you help me,
free me from this agony?

33:34.721 --> 33:36.054
Please, please.

33:36.180 --> 33:40.684
Your suffering weighs heavy
on my heart, spirit. Be free.

33:55.616 --> 33:56.658
Virgil, what's happening?

33:56.784 --> 33:59.911
How dare you free the damned?

34:00.038 --> 34:04.958
They deserve torment for wasting
their fleeting precious lives.

34:05.084 --> 34:07.878
And Beatrice? Does she deserve torment?

34:08.004 --> 34:10.088
She is the exception.

34:10.214 --> 34:14.717
A pure soul to remind me
of my place in Heaven,

34:14.844 --> 34:18.679
to remind me of the light of my father.

34:19.599 --> 34:22.100
But let me ask you, Dante,

34:22.226 --> 34:25.228
what of your father?

34:26.313 --> 34:28.899
Beatrice, you must eat.

34:29.025 --> 34:30.942
I have no appetite.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.235
I know you miss my son,

34:33.362 --> 34:36.697
but you must keep up
your constitution, child.

34:36.824 --> 34:38.949
You're nothing but bone.

34:39.077 --> 34:42.204
It's unappealing for a lady.

34:44.040 --> 34:47.042
Beatrice, what have you done to yourself?

34:51.880 --> 34:54.507
It's just another memory, Dante.

34:55.592 --> 34:57.928
Your father's memory.

34:58.054 --> 35:02.099
- My father?
- He is here with us, Dante.

35:02.225 --> 35:04.309
Would you like to visit him?

35:14.570 --> 35:17.531
Do these tortures never end?

35:19.617 --> 35:21.368
Virgil, Beatrice is not here.

35:21.494 --> 35:23.578
We must escape this beast!

35:29.252 --> 35:31.920
What is this?

35:32.797 --> 35:36.675
Cerberus's black heart.
Destroy it, quickly.

36:06.289 --> 36:08.081
Beatrice!

36:38.613 --> 36:41.781
More gold than I've ever laid eyes upon.

36:41.908 --> 36:44.826
What could one man do
with so much treasure?

36:45.870 --> 36:49.706
This is the fourth circle - Greed.

37:06.974 --> 37:10.810
All the Earth's treasure
that is beneath the moon or ever was

37:10.937 --> 37:13.730
cannot give relief to these weary souls.

37:19.737 --> 37:23.198
What a mockery is made
of the brief battle for possessions

37:23.324 --> 37:25.075
that makes so short a life.

37:25.201 --> 37:28.119
These damned remind me of my father.

37:36.170 --> 37:39.422
48, 49, 50, 51...

37:40.383 --> 37:44.386
What? Where are my last three coins?

37:44.512 --> 37:46.429
Dante?

37:47.598 --> 37:49.140
Dante!

37:50.935 --> 37:52.435
Bella!

37:54.063 --> 37:55.730
Yes, husband.

37:55.856 --> 37:58.650
I'm short three crowns.

37:58.776 --> 38:01.236
Are you stealing from me, woman?

38:01.362 --> 38:04.698
No, Alighiero,
I would never do such a thing.

38:06.450 --> 38:07.909
Liar!

38:12.164 --> 38:14.207
I knew I'd have to watch you.

38:14.333 --> 38:16.543
Now, tell me where
you've hidden it, woman,

38:16.669 --> 38:19.462
before I throttle you dead.

38:22.466 --> 38:24.843
Don't hit her! Mother!

38:38.983 --> 38:41.609
Can you believe that in my youth
I wanted to be a poet?

38:41.736 --> 38:44.112
But all I ever knew was violence.

38:44.238 --> 38:46.031
And what became of your mother?

38:46.157 --> 38:48.283
She died of a fever a year later.

38:48.409 --> 38:50.493
It was sudden and terrible.

38:52.163 --> 38:56.333
There is no room to pity the dead here, son.

38:56.459 --> 39:01.129
Lucifer did not lie, but then again
how could you not be here, Father?

39:01.797 --> 39:04.591
You think you're a greater man than me?

39:04.717 --> 39:07.552
That you're above reproach for your sins?

39:07.678 --> 39:11.264
I took up the Crusade.
The priest absolved us.

39:11.849 --> 39:14.517
And you actually believed him?

39:14.643 --> 39:17.270
No man can absolve you of your sins,

39:17.396 --> 39:21.232
but some men can be rewarded in Hell.

39:31.660 --> 39:34.662
Lucifer offered me a thousand years
free of torture

39:34.789 --> 39:39.167
and endless gold
if I would slay my own son.

39:39.668 --> 39:41.669
And where will you spend this gold, Father?

39:41.796 --> 39:44.756
Let me pass. I only seek Beatrice.

39:49.929 --> 39:51.429
So be it.

40:07.113 --> 40:09.406
I always despised you.

40:11.283 --> 40:13.743
But you became me, son.

40:13.869 --> 40:17.080
You belong here. You always have.

40:21.585 --> 40:24.921
So I can be damned in Hell with you?
Never!

40:33.639 --> 40:37.559
It's time to claim my prize, boy.

40:37.685 --> 40:39.519
Then claim it.

40:54.493 --> 40:56.995
You want gold, Father?

40:57.121 --> 40:58.621
It's yours.

41:04.753 --> 41:07.589
I cannot go on.

41:07.715 --> 41:09.299
You must, Dante.

41:09.425 --> 41:12.677
Steel yourself.
The journey is not half over.

41:12.803 --> 41:17.474
How do I know you're not
another enemy sent by Lucifer?

41:17.600 --> 41:19.976
You could be luring me
to my doom all along.

41:20.102 --> 41:22.270
Another trick, another deception.

41:22.396 --> 41:24.272
Search inside yourself.

41:24.398 --> 41:27.233
You know I was sent here from on high.

41:27.359 --> 41:29.152
Forgive me, Virgil.

41:29.278 --> 41:32.238
This place has affected my mind.
Let us move on.

41:39.288 --> 41:43.249
Please, Lord.
Forgive me of my transgressions.

41:43.375 --> 41:45.960
Save me from this horrible torment.

41:46.086 --> 41:49.255
Please, I beg of you.

41:53.802 --> 41:55.803
My God.

41:55.930 --> 41:59.641
I have heard your prayers,
beloved Beatrice,

41:59.767 --> 42:01.851
and I have come for you.

42:03.437 --> 42:06.814
There is no escape, little soul.

42:06.941 --> 42:09.901
Your prayers are worthless here.

42:20.788 --> 42:22.664
Rejoice, child,

42:22.790 --> 42:27.460
for you are about to be granted
a rare privilege in the Inferno.

42:28.546 --> 42:31.589
I am making you my bride.

42:32.508 --> 42:35.843
You will become the Queen of Hell.

42:37.012 --> 42:39.180
Are you not pleased?

42:51.193 --> 42:55.280
I cannot stand this wretched place.

42:55.406 --> 42:58.866
For we are in the fifth circle, Anger.

42:58.993 --> 43:01.744
The very air reeks of fury.

43:01.870 --> 43:04.163
Watch your ankles.

43:08.210 --> 43:11.212
More food! We're starving!

43:14.800 --> 43:16.426
We need more food.

43:18.929 --> 43:21.139
We're doing the best we can.

43:21.265 --> 43:24.809
There isn't enough food to go around.
Quiet! Quiet down!

43:24.935 --> 43:27.103
There is nothing we can do.

43:27.229 --> 43:29.147
The granaries are ablaze.

43:29.273 --> 43:31.399
We barely have enough rations
for our own men.

43:31.525 --> 43:35.278
Then I'm leaving this post.
I will not put up with guard duty any longer.

43:35.404 --> 43:37.572
You can't do that, Dante.

43:37.698 --> 43:40.658
We came here to kill these heretics,
not coddle them.

43:40.784 --> 43:42.952
We came to reclaim the Holy Land.

43:43.078 --> 43:46.914
Saladin took the city last year
and spared Christian lives.

43:47.041 --> 43:47.957
We should do the same.

43:48.083 --> 43:50.918
Since when are heretics
worth a Christian life?

43:51.045 --> 43:52.795
Enough. Enough!

44:03.766 --> 44:08.019
Keep your mind, Dante.
Do not dwell on past deeds here.

44:09.980 --> 44:12.899
See the souls over whom
anger has prevailed.

44:13.817 --> 44:18.279
In the black sludge of the River Styx
do they wish they had never been born.

44:18.405 --> 44:21.908
The fools. It is here we must cross.

44:30.501 --> 44:32.418
We travel in that?

44:32.544 --> 44:34.921
Perhaps we would be safer swimming.

44:41.762 --> 44:44.514
I suppose it doesn't get much sturdier.

44:44.640 --> 44:47.266
Is this a friend of yours, great poet?

44:47.393 --> 44:50.228
Phlegias is the guardian of the Styx.

44:50.354 --> 44:52.939
He was the son of Ares
and a king in his day.

44:53.065 --> 44:56.609
Hold on.
The ride will be somewhat bumpy.

44:57.486 --> 45:00.863
The angry souls know no end to their fury.

45:00.989 --> 45:05.451
Who are you that comes here
before your time?

45:05.577 --> 45:07.620
If I come, I do not remain.

45:07.746 --> 45:11.082
But I know you, hell dog, filthy as you are.

45:11.208 --> 45:12.917
You were Filippo Argenti in life.

45:13.043 --> 45:17.422
Come down, Dante,
and face your old enemy!

45:17.548 --> 45:21.134
Let the damned rip you to shreds, wretch.

45:40.028 --> 45:43.823
Now, my son, the City of Dis draws near,

45:43.949 --> 45:46.534
housing its solemn citizens within.

45:48.579 --> 45:53.374
Damned of Dis rejoice,
for your lord, Lucifer,

45:53.500 --> 45:56.961
is betrothing the pure soul, Beatrice.

45:57.087 --> 46:02.258
Truly this will be a marriage
of Heaven and Hell.

46:02.384 --> 46:05.344
Hurry, Phlegias! Run!

46:12.102 --> 46:13.269
Beatrice!

46:17.316 --> 46:21.277
Outcasts of Heaven, race despised,

46:21.403 --> 46:25.698
why do you rail against a will
that cannot be stopped?

46:26.575 --> 46:28.326
Dante?

46:49.556 --> 46:52.809
He has taken her into the tombs.
Hurry, Dante.

46:57.815 --> 47:03.027
Gone. Why does he do this?
Bait us on? Keep us running?

47:03.153 --> 47:06.739
Perhaps Lucifer wants your soul
as well as Beatrice's.

47:06.865 --> 47:09.325
He's luring us to the ninth circle.

47:10.452 --> 47:14.038
- What is this place?
- The tombs of heresy.

47:14.164 --> 47:17.500
Here in the sixth circle
you will find endless heretics

47:17.626 --> 47:19.710
burning in eternal fire.

47:21.004 --> 47:26.467
O Tuscan, who walks through this place
speaking so decorously,

47:26.593 --> 47:29.762
know that I am Farinata.

47:29.888 --> 47:34.767
Farinata, another hated man in life.
What do you want, spirit?

47:34.893 --> 47:36.227
Know this.

47:36.353 --> 47:40.773
The damned can foresee the future
but can never know the present.

47:40.899 --> 47:46.279
Your future, Dante,
is filled with death and destruction.

47:46.405 --> 47:50.324
Beatrice will marry Lucifer and reign in Hell,

47:50.450 --> 47:55.121
and you will be damned with us forever.

48:04.464 --> 48:06.424
I never liked him.

48:07.342 --> 48:08.718
What's happening?

48:08.844 --> 48:10.386
The harrowing of Hell.

48:10.512 --> 48:13.014
Christ's death forever quakes this circle.

48:13.140 --> 48:14.765
We must hurry.

48:17.185 --> 48:20.771
Let me go. What do you want from me?

48:20.898 --> 48:24.191
I have taken countless brides
over the millennia -

48:24.318 --> 48:28.321
Cleopatra, Salome, Helen of Troy.

48:28.447 --> 48:33.951
But, unlike them,
your spirit is pure, unspoiled.

48:34.077 --> 48:36.120
I will never succumb to you.

48:36.246 --> 48:37.747
Kill me again and again,

48:37.873 --> 48:42.084
slit my throat, tear me to pieces,
but I will never love you.

48:46.131 --> 48:48.716
Yes, such passion.

48:48.842 --> 48:51.135
You have a fire inside you.

48:51.261 --> 48:53.095
After we are properly married,

48:53.221 --> 48:57.308
you will give me a brood
to carry on my legacy.

48:57.434 --> 49:02.855
You will be birthing my children for eternity,
sweet soul.

49:04.483 --> 49:07.109
Virgil, do you hear...

49:14.743 --> 49:18.162
Who is this new monster?
What does he want?

49:18.288 --> 49:21.499
The minotaur guards passage
into the seventh circle.

49:21.625 --> 49:23.125
Be cautious, Dante.

49:24.252 --> 49:25.962
How dare you threaten us?

49:26.088 --> 49:29.674
Do you think he is the duke of Athens
who served up your death above?

49:29.800 --> 49:33.135
Off with you.
Begone, abomination!

49:33.261 --> 49:35.179
Virgil, I think you've made him angry.

49:35.305 --> 49:37.264
Now, while he is blind with rage.

49:37.391 --> 49:39.850
Hold fast. Steady.

49:39.977 --> 49:41.644
Now move!

49:49.403 --> 49:51.612
You have many surprises, poet.

49:51.738 --> 49:54.949
Perhaps you would have made
a great warrior in life.

49:55.075 --> 49:58.953
It was nothing. He was all horn, no brains.

50:07.295 --> 50:10.006
This circle is reserved for the violent.

50:10.132 --> 50:12.425
Those who have done violence
against others

50:12.551 --> 50:15.261
forever boil in the blood they have shed.

50:16.888 --> 50:18.806
How shall we cross?

50:18.932 --> 50:20.975
It's impossible.

50:24.688 --> 50:26.564
You summoned me, great Virgil.

50:26.690 --> 50:28.524
Greetings, Nessus.

50:28.650 --> 50:32.653
We need passage across the bloody
Phlegethon. Can you help us?

50:32.779 --> 50:35.823
Of course. Climb and hold on tightly.

50:37.576 --> 50:39.493
The river is treacherous.

50:41.204 --> 50:44.915
Here is Alexander, Dionysius, Attila,

50:45.042 --> 50:47.168
and countless others.

50:47.961 --> 50:51.213
The damned here
are worse off than the Styx.

50:51.339 --> 50:55.551
These were the kings of bloodshed
and despoilment.

51:12.652 --> 51:15.654
Be wary of the next passage, friends.

51:15.781 --> 51:17.823
My thanks, Nessus.

51:17.949 --> 51:20.576
Good luck to you, mortal soul.

51:23.330 --> 51:26.791
We must hurry. Beatrice can wait no longer.

51:30.962 --> 51:33.756
This is no forest.

51:33.882 --> 51:37.343
Yes, they are those who did violence
to themselves.

51:37.469 --> 51:40.221
- This is the wood of suicide.
- Dante...

51:40.347 --> 51:42.807
- No, my friend! Turn back!
- Come to me, Dante.

51:42.933 --> 51:45.643
Come to me, Dante.

51:45.769 --> 51:48.145
Come to me.

51:48.271 --> 51:52.650
Why do you break me?
Have you no pity?

51:52.776 --> 51:54.110
Mother?

51:54.236 --> 51:55.820
Yes, son.

51:55.946 --> 51:58.572
I too am among the damned.

51:58.698 --> 52:01.033
But how can this be?

52:01.701 --> 52:03.702
When a soul takes its own life,

52:03.829 --> 52:06.122
Minos judges it to this circle.

52:06.248 --> 52:09.291
Here it sprouts, shoots up like a sapling.

52:09.417 --> 52:11.710
No body, only pain.

52:11.837 --> 52:15.047
No, Mother, you don't belong here.

52:15.173 --> 52:16.799
You died of fever.

52:17.676 --> 52:20.052
Her heart gave out from the fever.

52:20.178 --> 52:22.680
She was just too fragile.

52:22.806 --> 52:24.682
Where is she now, Father?

52:24.808 --> 52:30.146
In Paradise, son,
with all the souls of pure light.

52:30.689 --> 52:33.065
I despised your father's cruelty,

52:33.191 --> 52:35.943
but I was too weak to defy him.

52:36.069 --> 52:38.487
And so, I...

52:38.613 --> 52:40.114
I took my...

52:41.658 --> 52:46.370
You learned your father's ways,
but you are not lost.

52:46.496 --> 52:49.039
You can redeem yourself.

52:49.166 --> 52:53.544
Beatrice was all I had.
How could I have betrayed her?

52:53.670 --> 52:57.631
The pain you endure purifies you, son.

52:57.757 --> 53:03.888
Heed my words. You must look
into your deepest sin to save her.

53:04.848 --> 53:06.807
And what of you?

53:06.933 --> 53:11.854
Only the living can redeem themselves.
I cannot.

53:11.980 --> 53:15.232
This is too cruel a punishment
for you, Mother.

53:15.358 --> 53:19.695
God must know this is not your fault.
I'm going to free you.

53:27.996 --> 53:31.624
My soul belongs to God now, son.

53:47.515 --> 53:49.975
We are still in the seventh circle?

53:50.101 --> 53:52.811
Yes, the Abominable Sands.

53:52.938 --> 53:56.815
It is here the damned
did violence against God.

54:00.362 --> 54:03.614
We came here to kill these heretics.

54:03.740 --> 54:05.991
We came to reclaim the Holy Land.

54:06.117 --> 54:10.579
Saladin took the city last year and spared
Christian lives. We should do the same.

54:10.705 --> 54:14.166
Since when are heretics
worth a Christian life?

54:14.292 --> 54:16.085
Enough. Enough!

54:17.295 --> 54:18.796
Dante, no!

54:32.978 --> 54:34.603
Fight with me, Crusaders.

54:34.729 --> 54:36.814
Spill the blood of these heathens.

54:36.940 --> 54:39.733
Their souls are already lost.

54:40.443 --> 54:43.112
Dante, what have you done?

55:08.263 --> 55:10.556
Crusaders? Here?

55:10.682 --> 55:12.349
Why are you being punished?

55:12.475 --> 55:15.561
Our cause was holy.
We are absolved of sin.

55:18.523 --> 55:23.777
The bishop lied, did he not, brother?

55:23.903 --> 55:26.780
Francesco, not you too.

55:26.906 --> 55:29.450
God never condones violence of any kind.

55:29.576 --> 55:32.703
There was no holy war.
Don't you understand?

55:32.829 --> 55:34.788
The priests lied.

55:34.914 --> 55:37.875
Of all people, how could you be here?

55:38.460 --> 55:40.836
It was you! You did this to me!

55:40.962 --> 55:42.796
No, no, no, listen.

55:42.922 --> 55:46.592
You don't deserve the life given to you,

55:46.718 --> 55:49.011
you don't deserve Beatrice,

55:49.137 --> 55:52.931
and now you will join us here forever
where you belong.

55:59.064 --> 56:00.105
Brother.

56:06.363 --> 56:08.530
I am not your brother.

56:08.656 --> 56:12.076
You're an animal, Dante.
A monster!

56:14.746 --> 56:16.997
I will not let you have her.

56:31.471 --> 56:34.640
You know I'm the better swordsman, Dante.

56:55.662 --> 56:59.706
It's over. Justice is inevitable.

57:00.041 --> 57:02.000
Not yet.

57:39.497 --> 57:41.623
He can rest for a while,

57:41.749 --> 57:46.920
but he is forever bound here
like a shadow of time unforgotten.

57:47.046 --> 57:49.715
He was a good man.

57:49.841 --> 57:52.176
He doesn't deserve such suffering.

57:52.302 --> 57:56.472
Heavenly Father,
let the soul of Francesco rise

57:56.598 --> 57:59.099
into your divine Paradise.

58:01.186 --> 58:02.686
What?

58:04.439 --> 58:07.566
Pray for your own soul, Dante,

58:07.692 --> 58:11.904
for it will freeze with me forever
in Cocytus below.

58:12.030 --> 58:14.615
I'll kill you in your own circle, Devil.

58:14.741 --> 58:17.284
Yes, a contest.

58:17.410 --> 58:22.539
Hurry, Dante. Your beloved Beatrice
is soon my queen.

58:34.385 --> 58:37.346
This is the union
of the three great rivers of Hell.

58:49.442 --> 58:51.568
Another beast I must slay?

58:52.987 --> 58:56.698
No, Dante. Geryon is our passage
to the eighth circle.

58:57.158 --> 59:00.702
Climb inside. And be wary - it bites.

59:11.673 --> 59:13.298
My thanks, Geryon.

59:13.424 --> 59:15.425
This way, Dante.

59:17.262 --> 59:19.513
We are in the circle of Fraud

59:19.639 --> 59:23.016
which one commits
upon those who trust in him.

59:26.896 --> 59:29.398
You must travel these ten malebolge alone.

59:29.524 --> 59:32.192
And quickly - Beatrice is soon to wed.

59:32.318 --> 59:35.737
Alone? What of you, great poet?

59:35.863 --> 59:37.823
I will not be far, believe me.

59:37.949 --> 59:39.825
You have proven yourself worthy.

59:39.951 --> 59:44.496
Now hurry, Dante,
lest you lose your love forever.

59:46.749 --> 59:50.168
I traveled on alone,
over the flatterers and simonists,

59:50.295 --> 59:53.255
and as I ran I was overwhelmed
with my sins

59:53.381 --> 59:56.550
as if every malebolge
was a chasm of memory.

59:56.676 --> 59:59.219
I felt my mind weakening with every step,

59:59.345 --> 01:00:01.805
and yet I would not cease.

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:10.564
Release that one.
His ransom has been paid.

01:00:11.649 --> 01:00:13.066
My ransom?

01:00:13.192 --> 01:00:16.862
No. No, you didn't...

01:00:16.988 --> 01:00:19.906
You defiled yourself with him, didn't you?

01:00:20.033 --> 01:00:22.993
Didn't you? You whore.

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:24.911
You have shamed me.

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:26.663
You are not my wife, do you hear?

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:29.249
Filthy whore. Whore!

01:00:31.836 --> 01:00:35.172
I'll kill you. You bastard dog, I'll kill you.

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:37.257
I swear I'll kill you.

01:00:39.385 --> 01:00:44.431
You bastard. You'll see everyone
you ever loved dead by my hand.

01:00:44.557 --> 01:00:46.642
Dead, dead!

01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:50.646
No, it can't be.

01:01:01.783 --> 01:01:03.867
I have come for the woman.

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:05.369
No!

01:01:08.539 --> 01:01:11.667
Leave her alone. She's innocent.

01:01:11.793 --> 01:01:13.794
Run, Beatrice, run!

01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:17.047
Get out of my house, filthy dog.

01:01:25.014 --> 01:01:28.058
- Get away from me!
- There is no escape for you.

01:01:28.184 --> 01:01:30.268
Stay back.

01:01:32.105 --> 01:01:33.730
No!

01:01:47.578 --> 01:01:50.497
Vengeance is finally mine.

01:01:54.794 --> 01:01:58.380
It was me. Beatrice's death.

01:01:58.506 --> 01:02:00.757
They were all murdered because of me.

01:02:00.883 --> 01:02:04.928
At last, Dante, now you both see the truth.

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:08.598
You are the true cause of
Beatrice's suffering,

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:11.977
and the damnation of so many others.

01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:14.771
How could you have done such evil to me?

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:19.025
Tear the heart from my chest,
rip the very soul from my body?

01:02:19.152 --> 01:02:22.320
These sins are my own.

01:02:22.447 --> 01:02:24.614
You have no right to Beatrice.

01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:26.616
Relinquish her.

01:02:32.039 --> 01:02:35.250
Never! Dwellers, night fiends,

01:02:35.376 --> 01:02:37.419
and torturers of the pit,

01:02:37.545 --> 01:02:41.089
strip the flesh from the mortal's bones.

01:02:41.215 --> 01:02:42.841
Lucifer!

01:02:57.148 --> 01:03:00.442
Beatrice, stop!
You don't know what you're doing!

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.195
I thought I knew many things.

01:03:03.321 --> 01:03:08.200
I thought love was real,
but it was only an illusion, a fraud.

01:03:08.326 --> 01:03:12.037
There is nothing left for me
in all of God's creation.

01:03:17.293 --> 01:03:18.752
Yes, my love.

01:03:18.878 --> 01:03:22.464
In union, all of Hell's power will be yours.

01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:25.008
Beatrice, don't do it!

01:03:28.346 --> 01:03:32.682
When you had your way with that girl,
you gave me to Lucifer.

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:35.143
It was all because of you.

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:38.271
Beatrice!

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:44.110
No!

01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:46.196
No, no.

01:03:48.908 --> 01:03:51.993
The faithful has lost her faith.

01:03:52.119 --> 01:03:55.705
The incorruptible
has become corrupted.

01:03:55.832 --> 01:04:00.585
The true innocent has given way
to the sins of man,

01:04:00.711 --> 01:04:03.588
like all the rest before her.

01:04:03.714 --> 01:04:07.509
Who can now deny me my rights?

01:04:17.019 --> 01:04:20.230
I will leave you with my consort.

01:04:21.607 --> 01:04:24.818
She has so much to show you.

01:04:35.371 --> 01:04:38.373
This is where you belong, Dante.

01:04:38.499 --> 01:04:41.167
You are the greatest fraud of all.

01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:43.879
You've lied to me, deceived me,

01:04:44.005 --> 01:04:47.507
and for that you shall suffer.

01:04:49.594 --> 01:04:51.553
Beatrice, don't do this.

01:04:59.186 --> 01:05:00.854
You never loved me.

01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:02.981
It was all a lie, all of it...

01:05:03.107 --> 01:05:05.150
our whole life!

01:05:11.365 --> 01:05:15.785
Beatrice, listen to me.
I braved the circles of Hell for you.

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:18.413
You mean nothing to me.

01:05:18.539 --> 01:05:22.918
But I have faced my sins.
I am ready to take you home.

01:05:23.044 --> 01:05:26.546
Faced your sins? Look down, Dante.

01:05:26.672 --> 01:05:29.341
Look deep into the ninth circle...

01:05:32.845 --> 01:05:35.138
the circle of traitors.

01:05:41.103 --> 01:05:44.356
God in Heaven, what happened?

01:05:44.482 --> 01:05:48.610
Who is responsible
for this massacre?

01:05:50.529 --> 01:05:54.240
Take care of my sister.
I am responsible.

01:05:56.410 --> 01:06:00.830
Hang him, and prepare to march tonight.

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:06.002
When the noble Saladin
learns of this atrocity

01:06:06.128 --> 01:06:09.047
he will bring forth the very forces of Hell.

01:06:10.049 --> 01:06:11.967
Take care of Beatrice.

01:06:12.093 --> 01:06:14.678
Dante, protect her with your life.

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:24.229
Beatrice, I'm coming home.

01:06:29.694 --> 01:06:33.363
I wanted nothing more
than to see you and beg for forgiveness.

01:06:33.489 --> 01:06:37.158
I will never forgive what you've done, never.

01:06:37.743 --> 01:06:40.662
But while I live, I can absolve you.

01:06:40.788 --> 01:06:44.082
Forgive me, and free yourself.

01:06:45.042 --> 01:06:47.252
My cross.

01:06:47.378 --> 01:06:49.754
I brought it back to you.

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:53.133
Accept again the love of God.

01:07:06.522 --> 01:07:08.231
Dante.

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:15.697
I forgive you.

01:07:15.823 --> 01:07:19.743
I never wanted any harm to come to you.

01:07:28.794 --> 01:07:31.463
You have done well, my friend.

01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:34.674
And though you may not
understand it now, Dante,

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:40.096
you have perhaps saved far more
than just one innocent soul.

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:47.729
Wait. I can't be separated from her now.
I've come this far.

01:07:47.855 --> 01:07:50.940
You cannot claim
a place with her yet, Dante.

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:55.987
You have to face the true enemy,
in the lowest part of the ninth circle...

01:07:56.113 --> 01:07:58.114
the circle of traitors.

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:03.119
There, you must face the king of traitors,
Lucifer himself.

01:08:03.245 --> 01:08:06.539
He guards your only escape
from the Inferno.

01:08:07.291 --> 01:08:11.419
We shall be reunited one day. I promise.

01:08:12.713 --> 01:08:14.214
Goodbye, my love.

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:20.845
This last trial is for you to face alone.

01:08:21.971 --> 01:08:23.932
Godspeed, my friend.

01:08:24.725 --> 01:08:28.435
Very well. I am coming for you, Lucifer.

01:08:28.562 --> 01:08:31.272
I will make you pay for her suffering.

01:08:32.066 --> 01:08:34.234
I am coming for you.

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:48.581
I fell, not into fire,

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:54.546
but into a vast, frozen wasteland.

01:08:56.006 --> 01:08:58.216
The very center of Hell,

01:09:00.678 --> 01:09:02.886
furthest place in all of creation

01:09:03.013 --> 01:09:05.348
from the divine light of God.

01:09:07.434 --> 01:09:11.979
Treachery, the ninth circle
of the Inferno.

01:09:19.446 --> 01:09:24.200
I walked through the darkness,
numb with bitter cold.

01:09:27.078 --> 01:09:30.206
All about me were forsaken,

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:35.252
frozen souls of deceivers and traitors.

01:09:41.093 --> 01:09:46.680
Who are you to walk the paths of Hell
so warmly, O living man?

01:09:46.807 --> 01:09:49.434
Damned soul, where is Lucifer?

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:52.854
Tell me, before I too freeze
in this miserable hell.

01:09:52.979 --> 01:09:59.402
Wipe the icy tears from my eyes,
and I shall tell you.

01:10:08.495 --> 01:10:12.165
The Lord of Hell dwells
at the center of this frozen lake.

01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:14.209
Past the storms of Ptolomea,

01:10:14.335 --> 01:10:17.045
deep in the center pit of Judecca,

01:10:17.171 --> 01:10:19.714
there his icy halls are well protected,

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:23.801
and none but the mightiest
may cleave a path.

01:10:23.928 --> 01:10:26.512
But can you believe me?

01:10:26.639 --> 01:10:28.723
Can you believe a traitor?

01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:37.440
Long did I wander
the dim and icy paths of Hell.

01:10:41.028 --> 01:10:43.613
Past the frozen giants of legend...

01:10:43.739 --> 01:10:48.159
Nimrod, Ephialtes and Antaeus.

01:10:49.870 --> 01:10:52.163
I was battered by a frigid wind

01:10:52.289 --> 01:10:55.959
that was like the beating
of Lucifer's black wings.

01:11:00.506 --> 01:11:04.092
Finally, after a seeming eternity,

01:11:04.218 --> 01:11:09.973
I came to a passage blocked
by the frozen links of a mighty chain.

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:15.270
Lucifer thinks he can block my way
with this?

01:11:15.396 --> 01:11:18.147
He thinks he can stay my vengeance?

01:11:53.183 --> 01:11:56.394
Welcome, great Dante.

01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:00.481
Welcome to your final resting place,

01:12:00.607 --> 01:12:02.567
the circle of traitors.

01:12:02.693 --> 01:12:05.737
Lucifer, I have come to escape this hell

01:12:05.863 --> 01:12:08.239
so that I may be reunited with my beloved,

01:12:08.365 --> 01:12:11.326
but not before I rid the world
of your corruption.

01:12:11.452 --> 01:12:14.245
You will never see Beatrice again.

01:12:14.371 --> 01:12:17.540
The path to Purgatory lies through me.

01:12:17.666 --> 01:12:21.627
You are the warrior
of a weak and dying God,

01:12:21.754 --> 01:12:24.047
a God who is the true evil.

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:27.008
His power wanes over the world.

01:12:27.134 --> 01:12:31.012
Silence. Your lies
have no power over me, Devil.

01:12:31.138 --> 01:12:35.183
I will rend the very soul
from your frozen body.

01:12:35.309 --> 01:12:37.518
Indignant fool.

01:12:37.644 --> 01:12:40.563
Come, let me devour your soul

01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:43.274
as I devoured Judas Iscariot.

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:48.863
You will remain in this pit
until creation's last breath, do you hear?

01:12:48.989 --> 01:12:51.032
Never!

01:12:51.992 --> 01:12:54.619
You are not invincible here.

01:12:54.745 --> 01:12:57.163
You are just another demon

01:12:57.289 --> 01:13:01.417
and, like any fallen, you can be destroyed.

01:13:02.961 --> 01:13:07.715
You cannot destroy me!

01:13:22.106 --> 01:13:24.816
What have you done to me?

01:13:34.868 --> 01:13:37.995
I have slain you, great beast.

01:13:38.122 --> 01:13:41.457
Victory is mine.

01:13:41.583 --> 01:13:43.376
What's this?

01:13:53.262 --> 01:13:55.805
New life writhes inside him.

01:13:55.931 --> 01:13:57.723
No!

01:14:06.066 --> 01:14:09.735
Thank you, Dante. I am very impressed.

01:14:09.862 --> 01:14:13.114
Many have tried, but all have failed me.

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:16.742
Ulysses, Alexander, Attila, Lancelot...

01:14:16.869 --> 01:14:20.455
Truly, you are the greatest of all my minions.

01:14:21.373 --> 01:14:23.541
Minion? I do not serve you.

01:14:23.667 --> 01:14:26.586
Speak without your forked tongue, serpent!

01:14:27.504 --> 01:14:29.630
Do you not?

01:14:29.756 --> 01:14:33.676
You freed me
from my eternal torment.

01:14:33.802 --> 01:14:36.179
I came only for Beatrice.

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:39.390
Beatrice? She was only bait.

01:14:39.516 --> 01:14:42.268
It was you I wanted all along.

01:14:42.394 --> 01:14:46.856
Don't you see?
I was bound by God in this frozen pit,

01:14:46.982 --> 01:14:50.359
only my shadow self allowed to roam free.

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:54.697
It took a mortal to release me -
you, Dante.

01:14:55.407 --> 01:14:57.116
No, it isn't true!

01:14:57.242 --> 01:14:58.910
I defeated you before.

01:14:59.036 --> 01:15:03.122
Show me the path from Hell,
or I will end your miserable existence.

01:15:03.248 --> 01:15:05.750
Destroy an angel of God?

01:15:05.876 --> 01:15:08.044
You arrogant gnat.

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:10.838
Such vanity, such pride.

01:15:10.964 --> 01:15:14.133
I could have slain you
the moment you fell into Hell.

01:15:24.728 --> 01:15:26.604
You worship God,

01:15:26.730 --> 01:15:29.524
but it was He who created evil.

01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:32.485
It was He who created me.

01:15:32.611 --> 01:15:37.073
If you knew the true nature of God, Dante,

01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:39.909
you too would rebel.

01:15:40.035 --> 01:15:41.202
No!

01:15:41.328 --> 01:15:45.456
You are nothing to me. A talking animal.

01:15:45.582 --> 01:15:48.334
He made you in His image...

01:15:50.671 --> 01:15:53.631
and I was to bow down to you?

01:16:08.814 --> 01:16:12.024
I grow weary of this game.

01:16:41.888 --> 01:16:46.851
Finally, I will reclaim
my proper place in Heaven.

01:16:47.227 --> 01:16:52.481
Behold, Dante.
Beyond the Inferno lies Purgatory,

01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:55.568
where awaits your precious Beatrice.

01:16:55.694 --> 01:16:59.572
But instead of you,
I shall escape from this pit.

01:16:59.698 --> 01:17:03.951
All the souls in Purgatory
shall suffer and burn.

01:17:04.077 --> 01:17:10.041
And beyond Purgatory, Paradise itself.

01:17:10.167 --> 01:17:13.836
I will plunge the cosmos into chaos,

01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:17.006
and it is all your doing, Dante.

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:23.471
Because of you, God will finally
see me rule His creation.

01:17:23.597 --> 01:17:27.433
No, I cannot be the cause of this.

01:17:27.559 --> 01:17:31.270
There is nothing you can do
to stop me, mortal.

01:17:31.396 --> 01:17:34.440
No one can stop me.

01:17:34.566 --> 01:17:36.567
One can.

01:17:40.781 --> 01:17:45.576
Almighty God, forgive me
for all of my wicked sins.

01:17:45.702 --> 01:17:49.955
I forsake my escape.
I give up even Beatrice.

01:17:50.082 --> 01:17:51.957
I belong here, in Hell,

01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:54.502
and accept my just damnation.

01:17:54.628 --> 01:17:57.588
What are you doing?

01:17:57.714 --> 01:18:01.717
A repentant soul in Judecca? Stop!

01:18:01.843 --> 01:18:03.552
Do not utter a word!

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:08.391
But grant me the power
to keep your enemy here with me.

01:18:09.476 --> 01:18:12.269
Stop. I command you.

01:18:12.396 --> 01:18:16.065
No!

01:18:55.063 --> 01:18:56.939
Purgatory.

01:19:22.883 --> 01:19:27.303
Beatrice. I will come to you yet.

01:19:27.429 --> 01:19:30.306
My love, I have forgiven you.

01:19:30.432 --> 01:19:35.352
God will forgive you.
Now forgive yourself.

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:48.449
I fought across Earth and Hell
to find my beloved Beatrice.

01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:54.205
We were together,
neither in Hell nor in Paradise,

01:19:54.331 --> 01:19:57.416
neither damned nor saved.

01:19:57.542 --> 01:20:01.545
I did not die, and I did not live.

01:20:02.305 --> 01:20:08.328
