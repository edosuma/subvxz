WEBVTT

00:05.806 --> 00:07.992
Coffee, gum...

00:08.809 --> 00:09.817
tampons?

00:10.154 --> 00:11.579
Seriously? Tampons.

00:11.837 --> 00:13.487
Wow. Brave new world, fellas.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.417
Did she say what kind she wants?

00:15.549 --> 00:17.459
No, no details. But you know what?

00:17.691 --> 00:19.771
I know a little about tampons
'cause I have a sister.

00:19.886 --> 00:21.486
- I have a mother.
- I've got an ex-wife.

00:21.756 --> 00:23.386
We got this.

00:23.467 --> 00:26.535
So the question is do we get
the pink box or the purple one?

00:26.617 --> 00:27.632
Desert Mist.

00:28.071 --> 00:29.195
What kind of flavor is that?

00:29.496 --> 00:31.378
It's a scent of mist in the desert.

00:31.768 --> 00:33.370
Okay, man. I don't know.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.140
Do you think she wants
a nighttime tampon?

00:35.169 --> 00:36.947
There's a difference between
nighttime and daytime?

00:36.971 --> 00:39.154
Yeah, yeah, like that one's
got the moon and stars on it.

00:39.178 --> 00:42.018
But so does Lucky Charms,
and they're for the morning.

00:42.118 --> 00:44.002
- Huh?
- Those are pads.

00:44.555 --> 00:46.222
And there's no such thing
as nighttime tampons.

00:46.246 --> 00:47.912
Are to. My wife used to send me

00:47.937 --> 00:49.807
on runs for nighttime
tampons all the time.

00:50.004 --> 00:51.909
- Well, she hated you.
- Eddie Spaghetti?

00:52.121 --> 00:54.242
Oh! That is you. Eddie Penisi.

00:54.306 --> 00:57.115
- Uh... 
- Trudy Towers. Do you remember me?

00:57.306 --> 01:00.313
Oh, my God, Trudy Towers.
Of course I remember you.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.132
You look good. All grown up.

01:02.463 --> 01:04.328
Look at you. You're a firefighter.

01:04.331 --> 01:05.370
Captain, no less.

01:06.302 --> 01:07.769
- Gosh.
- Yeah, well.

01:07.930 --> 01:11.414
Actually, I could use your help with
this new carbon monoxide detector.

01:11.439 --> 01:12.874
I don't know how to install it.

01:13.667 --> 01:15.469
It's easy. You just plug it in.

01:15.788 --> 01:16.793
Plug it in to what?

01:16.923 --> 01:18.040
Into an outlet.

01:18.901 --> 01:20.763
Then what would I do
with my air freshener?

01:21.548 --> 01:24.593
Rescue 42, 65-year-old
male reported chest pains.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.198
Requested EMS response.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.837
24, responding. I'm so sorry.
I got to go save somebody.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.934
Call me at the station. I'll
help you out with everything.

01:31.958 --> 01:32.969
All right. Okay, okay.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.993
Okay, Eddie Spaghetti,
what was all that about?

01:36.096 --> 01:38.131
- How do you know her?
- She took my virginity.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074

02:00.614 --> 02:03.282
It was the summer of '92
when a recently divorced

02:03.307 --> 02:05.974
48-year-old former center-fold
became the neighbor

02:05.976 --> 02:08.577
of a horny AF 16-year-old boy.

02:09.913 --> 02:11.914
She was 48 and you were 16.

02:11.916 --> 02:13.516
- Yep.
- She was a center-fold?

02:13.518 --> 02:14.898
- Big time.
- Really just honed

02:14.923 --> 02:15.924
in on different things there.

02:15.948 --> 02:18.999
Center-fold... July 1972.

02:19.123 --> 02:20.723
And when I met her,
she was still super fit

02:20.725 --> 02:22.791
from doing those Paula
Abdul workout videos.

02:22.793 --> 02:25.971
To this day, I still get turned
on by leggings with stirrups.

02:26.463 --> 02:28.637
- To this day.
- Who's Paul Abdul? He sounds hot.

02:29.199 --> 02:30.999
- Sorry, Cap, keep going.
- Oh, man.

02:31.001 --> 02:32.095
I would mow her lawn.

02:32.331 --> 02:34.515
And she stepped outside with
a fresh pitcher of lemonade.

02:34.539 --> 02:36.438
I knew it was time to go back inside.

02:36.540 --> 02:38.708
Hey.

02:39.679 --> 02:41.119
I can still smell the scent

02:41.144 --> 02:44.325
of fresh cut grass mingled
with her perfume.

02:47.218 --> 02:48.715
Infatu-oso.

02:49.554 --> 02:50.753
And she taught me everything.

02:50.755 --> 02:52.480
We even did missionary fifth base.

02:52.556 --> 02:53.756
Sounds like a jazz band.

02:53.758 --> 02:55.158
Wait, what's missionary fifth base?

02:55.292 --> 02:57.045
Mm. Mm-mm.

02:57.294 --> 02:58.360
Missionary, though?

02:58.362 --> 02:59.758
It's tough, but you do it.

03:00.231 --> 03:02.893
So, Miss July, you gonna give
her a little summer loving?

03:03.033 --> 03:04.233
Oh, that's not even funny, dude.

03:04.235 --> 03:06.835
You saw her shuffle around back
there with the prunes in her cart.

03:07.037 --> 03:09.123
I mean, one good thrust,
and she'd turn to powder.

03:09.774 --> 03:12.174
They say you always have a
soft spot for your first one.

03:12.176 --> 03:15.498
Yeah, I lost my virginity
to Emily Bernard.

03:15.621 --> 03:17.753
And I wish I had another
crack at it, you know?

03:17.778 --> 03:18.824
She worked at the zoo.

03:18.849 --> 03:21.516
And there was this mob of baby meerkats

03:21.518 --> 03:23.116
that would watch us get it on.

03:23.283 --> 03:24.630
Man, it was beautiful.

03:24.655 --> 03:26.254
They would just pop up and
be like, "Mee, mee, mee."

03:26.256 --> 03:27.456
And I'd be like, "Yeah, yeah."

03:27.458 --> 03:28.657
And they'd be like, "Mee, mee, mee."

03:28.659 --> 03:30.993
I felt like Matt Damon
in "We Bought a Zoo."

03:32.352 --> 03:34.795
CJ Thomas at the Dairy King snack shack.

03:35.199 --> 03:36.665
We did it on this ice cream case.

03:36.667 --> 03:38.467
So now whenever I have
sex, I have this thing...

03:38.469 --> 03:40.029
Oh, come on. I don't want to hear this.

03:40.714 --> 03:42.114
Na-na-na-na-na-na!

03:42.139 --> 03:45.545
Mine was Mandy Carvallo, senior year.

03:45.630 --> 03:47.030
- High school?
- No, college.

03:47.121 --> 03:49.188
Wait, you waited until you
were a senior in college.

03:49.213 --> 03:51.686
No, bro. She was a senior in college.

03:52.293 --> 03:53.464
I was 27.

03:56.390 --> 03:58.990
- Right.
- I was a full 10 years younger than you

03:59.015 --> 04:00.184
when I lost my virginity.

04:00.290 --> 04:02.401
- You were seven?
- Come on! You're her uncle!

04:02.426 --> 04:04.004
And you keep popping out of nowhere.

04:04.029 --> 04:05.054
Talk about sports.

04:05.417 --> 04:07.147
- Sorry.
- Okay, Granny, you go.

04:07.649 --> 04:08.734
Erica Kools.

04:08.995 --> 04:11.262
She was the football coach's daughter.

04:11.287 --> 04:12.321
- Oh.
- Ooh.

04:12.346 --> 04:13.901
- Nice.
- You know what?

04:14.683 --> 04:17.298
That's why I have the hots
for the new dispatcher.

04:17.642 --> 04:19.642
She sounds just like Erica did.

04:19.644 --> 04:20.644
Mm-hmm.

04:20.644 --> 04:23.285
Ah, she, the new dispatcher is a dude.

04:24.248 --> 04:26.110
No, she isn't. I've
been flirting with her.

04:26.218 --> 04:27.376
- She isn't.
- No big deal,

04:27.401 --> 04:29.241
but you've definitely
been flirting with a man.

04:30.054 --> 04:32.304
Can I come back in?
Are you guys done now?

04:34.973 --> 04:36.608
That's your fourth cookie, rabbit.

04:36.927 --> 04:39.157
You're gonna get diarrhea
from  all that chocolate.

04:39.864 --> 04:40.958
Hey, Chiefy.

04:41.209 --> 04:42.442
What, is it mac and cheese day?

04:42.466 --> 04:44.165
Yeah, Pasta Penisi. Go help yourself.

04:44.353 --> 04:46.066
Leave some for the rest of us, okay?

04:49.654 --> 04:51.988
Come on, Chief, we're at a
perfectly delightful lunch

04:52.142 --> 04:54.276
until you came in here, started
scratching your scaly arms.

04:54.278 --> 04:56.178
Oh, get over, huh? It's
that time of the year.

04:56.239 --> 04:57.482
- I get extra dry.
- Yeah.

04:57.507 --> 04:59.151
It's that time of the
year for me too, Chief...

04:59.175 --> 05:02.492
allergy season. And all the dust
in the station is from your skin.

05:03.888 --> 05:05.954
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
You need to moisturize.

05:05.956 --> 05:07.698
Nobody needs to moisturize, okay?

05:07.830 --> 05:09.941
It's a fad. It's for girls.

05:09.966 --> 05:11.165
Don't point at me.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.582
There's a lot of guys that moisturize.

05:12.606 --> 05:13.874
- I bet these guys moisturize.
- Yeah.

05:13.898 --> 05:16.231
I wear night cream during the
daytime 'cause I'm a bad boy.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.807
- How come you don't like it?
- I don't know. It's gross.

05:18.835 --> 05:20.336
Makes my arm hair wet.

05:20.504 --> 05:22.821
I can't feel my fingerprints,
like the loops and the swirls

05:22.845 --> 05:24.289
get filled up with cream.

05:24.480 --> 05:25.904
- Disgusting.
- Feel your fingerprints?

05:25.928 --> 05:27.091
That makes no sense.

05:27.116 --> 05:28.755
It literally looks like
you're grating cheese.

05:28.779 --> 05:30.645
Yeah, the whole idea
of moisturizing cream

05:30.647 --> 05:33.048
is to moisturize it so it
doesn't flake like that.

05:33.050 --> 05:34.449
- It's a gross word... moist.
- Look at his elbow.

05:34.451 --> 05:35.984
- It's like a White Walker.
- Oh, God.

05:35.986 --> 05:37.720
- Come on.
- It looks like a root vegetable.

05:37.722 --> 05:38.987
I hope that's not genetic.

05:38.989 --> 05:40.322
You're like a snake shedding skin.

05:40.324 --> 05:42.316
All right. Enough, enough
with the lotion talk.

05:42.341 --> 05:43.874
Okay, listen. Just hear me out.

05:43.994 --> 05:46.461
How about this, okay?
You try moisturizing.

05:46.463 --> 05:47.662
Just try it for one day.

05:47.664 --> 05:48.931
And we'll all shut up
about it. Right, guys?

05:48.933 --> 05:50.306
- Yes. Absolutely.
- Yes.

05:50.331 --> 05:51.530
- One day?
- It's one day.

05:51.597 --> 05:52.667
- One day?
- One day.

05:52.692 --> 05:54.235
- Yeah.
- Okay, fine. I will try it

05:54.236 --> 05:55.826
just to make you cry babies shut up.

05:56.119 --> 05:57.250
- Great.
- What are we trying?

05:57.274 --> 05:58.356
Quinoa, pilates?

05:58.446 --> 05:59.446
No, it's a...

05:59.543 --> 06:02.110
Station 24, rescue 42.

06:02.277 --> 06:04.079
- See? Wait,
- See, sounds like a girl.

06:04.081 --> 06:06.014
- it's totally a dude.
- You crazy.

06:06.016 --> 06:07.819
No, you're crazy. You're crazy.

06:08.110 --> 06:09.195
Look... It's a...

06:09.220 --> 06:10.419
- Sounds like Erica.
- It's a dude.

06:10.421 --> 06:11.486
- It's a dude.
- Sounds like Erica.

06:11.488 --> 06:12.621
Hey! You two, pinch it off.

06:12.623 --> 06:14.757
- Let's go.
- Erica had a nut sack...

06:14.759 --> 06:16.225
No, no, no.

06:31.369 --> 06:32.881
Thank you for coming, Eddie.

06:34.712 --> 06:35.845
My pleasure.

06:42.452 --> 06:45.107
Stick it here, in the lower socket.

06:45.255 --> 06:47.189
- See.
- Lower socket?

06:47.191 --> 06:48.790
Yeah. Easy as pie.

06:48.792 --> 06:51.635
Sticking an inanimate
object into a tight hole,

06:52.230 --> 06:53.659
just like old times, huh?

06:53.863 --> 06:56.008
Yeah.

06:58.370 --> 07:00.002
Would you help me with one more thing?

07:00.202 --> 07:01.211
Yeah, anything.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.872
I have to change the
bulb in this fixture.

07:03.874 --> 07:06.177
And I'm really nervous about
getting up on the step stool.

07:06.362 --> 07:07.828
Say no more. I'm a firefighter.

07:07.878 --> 07:09.011
I get up on ladders all the time.

07:09.013 --> 07:10.085
All right.

07:12.737 --> 07:14.070
All right.

07:14.952 --> 07:16.277
And we meet again.

07:19.420 --> 07:20.570
There we go.

07:20.826 --> 07:22.119
All right.

07:22.620 --> 07:24.683
Anyway. I should probably be going.

07:25.739 --> 07:27.635
Feels like I've done a lot.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.848
You look terrific. I mean.

07:30.034 --> 07:31.342
I know you're really busy, but,

07:31.367 --> 07:33.811
I have one last favor to ask of you.

07:34.026 --> 07:35.541
Yeah, Trudy, anything.

07:35.783 --> 07:37.616
Will you take me up to my bedroom

07:37.641 --> 07:41.099
and plug your air freshener
into my lower socket?

07:44.982 --> 07:46.443
I'm dying.

07:47.527 --> 07:49.330
I've only got two months to live.

07:50.965 --> 07:52.165
Trudy, that's terrible.

07:52.190 --> 07:54.754
And I want to make love
to you one last time.

07:55.059 --> 07:57.702
So, like, you were my
first and I'd be your last.

07:58.013 --> 08:00.465
If you're dying, I'd be a
real shitty person to say no.

08:00.765 --> 08:01.832
Yeah.

08:13.543 --> 08:16.844
Hey. How'd it go with Centrum Silver?

08:17.014 --> 08:19.490
Yeah, did you do a little
coo-coo-ca-choo with Mrs. Robinson?

08:21.285 --> 08:23.283
Did she complain about mobile banking?

08:23.869 --> 08:25.349
My grandma always complains about it.

08:25.575 --> 08:27.067
- It's pretty tricky.
- You guys are sick.

08:27.091 --> 08:29.171
Why don't you hyenas get
your mind out of the gutter.

08:29.359 --> 08:30.692
Hey, oh. Good morning.

08:30.694 --> 08:32.159
- Good morning. Good morning.
- Hey.

08:32.162 --> 08:33.464
- Hey.
- Hey. How's it going, Chief?

08:33.488 --> 08:34.496
Well, you're in a good mood.

08:34.520 --> 08:36.868
That's because I'm a new
man... a new smoother man.

08:36.953 --> 08:39.809
Oh. Yeah, who do I have
to thank for this? I mean, look.

08:39.835 --> 08:41.866
I have asked this man to
moisturize for how long.

08:41.905 --> 08:44.440
And these are the hands that I married.

08:44.442 --> 08:46.151
Look at them. So soft.

08:46.199 --> 08:48.399
Yeah, you know what we did with
these soft hands last night?

08:48.423 --> 08:50.222
Are you familiar with
the Kamasutra position

08:50.247 --> 08:51.417
called "The Crunchy Fry"?

08:51.849 --> 08:53.999
- Hey, I don't want to hear that.
- Seriously.

08:54.024 --> 08:56.161
They usually smell like
corn ships and foot powder,

08:56.186 --> 08:57.719
- but now... 
- Ugh.

08:57.721 --> 08:58.868
- Lotion!
- Yeah.

08:59.753 --> 09:01.828
- What do you got there?
- It's a beautifying lotion.

09:01.852 --> 09:02.874
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

09:02.899 --> 09:04.033
- Is it good?
- I love it.

09:04.058 --> 09:05.505
It's got cocoa butter in it and stuff.

09:05.529 --> 09:06.724
I use it for my whole body.

09:07.150 --> 09:08.192
It's mine now.

09:08.618 --> 09:10.048
- What?
- This is the chief's lotion.

09:10.072 --> 09:12.341
- What are you mugging the guy?
- I got a lady to impress.

09:12.365 --> 09:13.429
Aw, come here. Come here, come here.

09:13.453 --> 09:15.230
- Mwah. Mwah.
- Mmm..

09:15.739 --> 09:17.072
Look how moist my lips
are. My lips are moist.

09:17.074 --> 09:19.064
Oh, come on, guys.

09:19.089 --> 09:20.984
Grow up. I love this chief.

09:21.078 --> 09:23.196
Yeah, grow up. It's natural.
How do you think you got here?

09:23.220 --> 09:26.584
You keep turning back
the clock on those paws.

09:27.017 --> 09:28.595
- I will.
- Get a room, you guys.

09:28.620 --> 09:29.863
- I'm gonna have another sibling.
- Whoo!

09:29.887 --> 09:33.474
That is some stink from you.
What is that? Oh, man.

09:33.691 --> 09:36.424
That's that Infatu-oso smell.

09:36.426 --> 09:38.887
You remember that
smell of that old lady?

09:38.962 --> 09:40.228
Across the street?

09:40.230 --> 09:42.698
Nude-y Trudy Towers... 
it was her perfume.

09:42.700 --> 09:43.737
It was gross.

09:43.762 --> 09:45.612
Yeah, you know, I helped her
out around the house yesterday.

09:45.636 --> 09:47.236
So probably some of it rubbed off on me.

09:47.638 --> 09:48.704
Oh, my God.

09:48.706 --> 09:51.939
Eddie, are you sleeping
with Trudy Towers again?

09:52.313 --> 09:54.377
What is wrong with you people?
It's like you all ate asshole biscuits

09:54.401 --> 09:55.401
this morning for breakfast.

09:55.405 --> 09:57.265
Eddie, you are such a pervert!

09:57.290 --> 09:58.890
How old is she now?

09:58.983 --> 10:00.316
How should I know? 73.

10:00.318 --> 10:02.449
In other words, too old
for me to have sex with.

10:02.653 --> 10:04.934
Oh, yeah. Right. If Diane Sawyer
walked in here right now,

10:04.989 --> 10:06.121
you'd make some news with her, huh?

10:06.123 --> 10:07.923
- She's 73.
- That's unfair.

10:07.925 --> 10:09.853
You know I have a soft
spot for anchorwomen.

10:10.047 --> 10:11.447
It's okay to admit it, Captain.

10:11.529 --> 10:12.995
Gladys Knight is 74 years old,

10:12.997 --> 10:15.766
and I'd ride her "Midnight Train"
all the way to Georgia and back.

10:16.002 --> 10:17.335
Joe Biden is 75,

10:17.378 --> 10:20.124
and I'd be on his foreign-relations
committee any day of the week!

10:20.149 --> 10:21.893
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:21.997 --> 10:25.011
Baby, please. You, stop
banging an old lady.

10:25.045 --> 10:26.111
That is disgusting.

10:26.143 --> 10:28.344
Hey, hey, hey, for the last time,

10:28.346 --> 10:31.013
I would never have
sex with a 73-year-old.

10:31.015 --> 10:32.348
- Everybody got that?
- Okay.

10:32.350 --> 10:34.194
- We're just razzing ya.
- Hey, how old do you go?

10:34.218 --> 10:35.857
I'd go grandma from "Moana."

10:35.897 --> 10:36.968
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

10:36.993 --> 10:38.464
And then I'd let her
turn into a stingray,

10:38.488 --> 10:39.666
and then I'd do it again.

10:39.691 --> 10:41.030
- She's animated, though.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:41.054 --> 10:42.063
Why? What about you?

10:42.107 --> 10:43.215
I always had a thing for that lady

10:43.239 --> 10:44.799
from the "Blade Runner" with the snake.

10:44.828 --> 10:46.143
- Oh.
- Always found her hot.

10:47.164 --> 10:48.630
Hey, you. Thanks for calling back.

10:48.632 --> 10:49.898
I'm sorry I missed your call.

10:49.900 --> 10:52.384
I fell down three times
getting the phone.

10:53.162 --> 10:55.274
That's what I get for
having my legs up over my...

10:57.436 --> 10:58.685
Did you hear that? What was that?

10:58.709 --> 11:00.776
Yeah. I think that was
you pressing the buttons.

11:00.778 --> 11:01.887
No. No. It was different.

11:02.380 --> 11:03.940
That's all right. Phones can be tricky.

11:04.248 --> 11:06.514
It's a 22-year-old I
met at a rave last night.

11:06.516 --> 11:08.036
So dumb, she can't even use the phone.

11:08.156 --> 11:09.889
Mm. A rave, huh?

11:09.987 --> 11:11.186
That's how I roll.

11:11.188 --> 11:12.668
Mm. Congrats.

11:15.793 --> 11:17.726
Oh, my God. I cannot
stop thinking about you.

11:17.728 --> 11:19.595
- When can I see you again?
- How about tomorrow?

11:19.597 --> 11:21.597
Let's meet at the soup station at 11:30.

11:21.622 --> 11:23.509
Make sure that we get one
of the booths in the middle.

11:23.533 --> 11:25.467
Otherwise, you can't get
the waitress's attention

11:25.469 --> 11:26.589
when you want a refill of...

11:27.738 --> 11:30.272
Aah. Okay. Okay. Yeah.
Soup station at 11:30.

11:31.048 --> 11:32.540
I'll see... It's this
waitress I'm dating.

11:32.542 --> 11:33.809
She, uh, is working
her way through college

11:33.811 --> 11:35.211
'cause that's what young people do.

11:35.634 --> 11:37.982
Trudy, the thing you did with
my tingle button last night

11:38.015 --> 11:39.396
was, like, unbelievable.

11:40.751 --> 11:43.364
Paramedic Smith from
Station 24 to Dispatch.

11:44.665 --> 11:46.467
Dispatch to Station 24.

11:46.760 --> 11:49.802
Hey! Um, I was working on the paperwork

11:49.827 --> 11:51.910
on that cardiac you
sent us out on yesterday,

11:52.162 --> 11:53.762
and I don't have the proper address.

11:53.764 --> 11:54.815
Could you give that to me?

11:55.254 --> 11:57.371
3843 Sammish Avenue.

11:57.768 --> 11:59.047
I'm writing it down right now.

11:59.237 --> 12:00.548
Right now, as we speak.

12:00.638 --> 12:02.118
I don't know what I'd do without you.

12:02.708 --> 12:03.710
Oh, don't mention it.

12:03.831 --> 12:05.430
Is there a science lab around here?

12:05.519 --> 12:07.302
'Cause I'm sensing some chemistry.

12:07.929 --> 12:09.960
- What's your name?
- I'm Taylor.

12:10.246 --> 12:11.606
Anything else I can help you with?

12:11.710 --> 12:12.762
Oh, no.

12:12.878 --> 12:15.277
You've answered all of
my questions, Taylor.

12:16.100 --> 12:17.703
♪ Taylor ♪

12:18.491 --> 12:20.434
Are we really doing this?
We're gonna prank the chief?

12:20.458 --> 12:22.390
Of course we are. He's a lotion bully,

12:22.392 --> 12:23.792
and that's the worst kind of bully.

12:24.328 --> 12:25.527
He's gonna kill us... 
you know that, right?

12:25.529 --> 12:28.116
No, no. He's gonna realize that
it's mayonnaise right away,

12:28.266 --> 12:30.089
and then, once he does,
we'll all laugh about it.

12:30.113 --> 12:31.312
He'll be like, "Man... "

12:31.401 --> 12:33.201
He'll be like, "Ha! You
guys are my favorite."

12:33.299 --> 12:35.075
Be like, "Ah, man, we have fun here."

12:36.047 --> 12:37.276
- Mm. Okay.
- Here.

12:37.301 --> 12:39.562
What? What do I do with it?

12:39.759 --> 12:41.093
- Well, just put it down.
- Yeah.

12:41.279 --> 12:42.878
Yeah, just put it there,
yeah, so he can see.

12:42.880 --> 12:44.680
Ooh! This must be what
cocaine feels like.

12:44.682 --> 12:46.482
- I don't know.
- Wee-ooh! Wee-ooh! Wee-ooh!

12:46.484 --> 12:47.949
Hey, come check this out.

12:47.951 --> 12:48.980
Gather around, everybody.

12:49.121 --> 12:51.313
Look at this.

12:52.422 --> 12:54.022
- Boom.
- Damn!

12:54.024 --> 12:55.104
Aha!

12:55.231 --> 12:56.430
Wow. That's that lady?

12:56.560 --> 12:58.960
- Dynamite.
- Trudy Towers was hot, dude.

12:58.962 --> 13:00.562
- Whew!
- Hey.

13:00.794 --> 13:02.304
What are you guys
looking at? What's this?

13:02.328 --> 13:03.588
Oh, a Q&A with Richard Nixon.

13:04.004 --> 13:05.145
I wonder what he's been up to.

13:05.169 --> 13:07.495
This is a 1972 "Playpen" magazine,

13:07.571 --> 13:09.845
and that is the old lady
we've been talking about.

13:10.041 --> 13:11.186
Whoa!

13:11.309 --> 13:12.508
You are having sex with her, aren't you?

13:12.510 --> 13:13.697
All right, enough. Enough.

13:13.746 --> 13:17.340
The day I bang a modern-day
Trudy Towers is the day

13:17.381 --> 13:20.239
I eat a burrito made out of
Granny's cheetah-skin underwear.

13:20.281 --> 13:21.310
Oh!

13:21.385 --> 13:22.518
- Okay.
- They're leopard skin.

13:22.520 --> 13:23.719
- Okay.
- But I'll take it, anyway.

13:23.721 --> 13:25.120
- Whatever.
- That's a good bet.

13:26.129 --> 13:27.693
Oh, yeah, um...

13:27.725 --> 13:29.360
- What's that?
- What?

13:29.434 --> 13:31.368
That's just, um... That's
just some lotion.

13:31.529 --> 13:33.128
- Some new lotion?
- New lotion, yeah.

13:33.130 --> 13:34.930
It's very super hydrating.

13:34.932 --> 13:36.676
Yeah. Just regular, plain.

13:36.701 --> 13:38.169
- The best kind.
- The best kind.

13:38.194 --> 13:39.393
- Yeah.
- Go ahead, please.

13:39.469 --> 13:40.924
- Try it out.
- Just use a bit.

13:40.949 --> 13:42.148
- Ooh, yeah.
- Whoa.

13:42.173 --> 13:43.517
Yeah, you're really putting it on there.

13:43.541 --> 13:45.140
- That's great.
- Yeah.

13:45.142 --> 13:46.255
Smells good?

13:46.323 --> 13:48.211
- Wow. It smells... like?
- Familiar.

13:48.278 --> 13:49.345
- Uh-huh.
- It smells familiar.

13:49.347 --> 13:50.474
- Do you like it?
- Well, it says,

13:50.498 --> 13:51.883
Alpine, but it's not
Alpine. It's like...

13:51.907 --> 13:52.907
Yeah.

13:52.980 --> 13:54.220
Smells like a... like a picnic.

13:54.284 --> 13:55.949
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

13:55.974 --> 13:57.353
Like a fancy picnic, you know?

13:57.378 --> 13:59.068
- We're sorry.
- With the good condiments.

13:59.093 --> 14:00.653
- Right?
- Yeah, yeah. It's not ketchup.

14:00.691 --> 14:02.290
It's not, you know, mustard.

14:02.292 --> 14:03.759
Like a brown mustard
with the seeds in it.

14:03.761 --> 14:05.761
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, we didn't know.

14:05.763 --> 14:07.563
We were just like, "Ah, let's do it."

14:07.565 --> 14:08.983
- Yeah.
- You know what it's like?

14:09.166 --> 14:10.229
It's like mine.

14:10.888 --> 14:12.020
I'm taking this with me.

14:12.102 --> 14:14.102
This is now my lotion, guys.

14:14.104 --> 14:16.016
- Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
- Oh, yes but... Sorry, Chief...

14:16.040 --> 14:17.360
Nah, nah, nah, nah. Nah, nah, no.

14:17.403 --> 14:19.096
It's mine. My lotion.

14:19.710 --> 14:20.897
What just happened?

14:21.142 --> 14:23.151
H-He didn't know that was mayonnaise.

14:23.386 --> 14:24.690
- Dick-tap!
- Ohh!

14:24.715 --> 14:26.897
Ohh! Oho, oh! Good one, Chief.

14:27.651 --> 14:28.786
Mm.

14:29.046 --> 14:31.496
So, I was just filling out my paperwork

14:31.521 --> 14:33.255
for the MVA from yesterday,

14:33.257 --> 14:35.566
and I realized that I
don't have the address.

14:35.929 --> 14:36.995
Could you get it for me?

14:37.351 --> 14:39.235
1216 East McKinley.

14:39.426 --> 14:40.960
Thank you so much.

14:40.985 --> 14:43.592
I mean, I have just been
slammed with paperwork.

14:43.704 --> 14:44.706
You sound tall.

14:44.731 --> 14:46.220
- How tall are you?
- 5'10".

14:46.245 --> 14:49.007
Has anyone ever told you
that you sound like Joe Biden?

14:49.257 --> 14:50.364
Is that a good thing?

14:50.455 --> 14:53.642
Oh, it's a great thing... I
mean, definitely, in my book.

14:53.694 --> 14:54.904
Uh, thanks. Gotta go. Out.

14:55.212 --> 14:56.544
Aha!

14:56.546 --> 14:57.813
You were on with Dispatch, weren't you?

14:57.815 --> 14:59.942
No, I was just... I just
had a paperwork question.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.949
In the bunk room. Please.

15:02.086 --> 15:04.284
- You were flirting.
- Okay, fine. Maybe I was.

15:04.622 --> 15:05.951
But so what? Who cares?

15:06.044 --> 15:07.778
I'm cool with it, as long as you know

15:07.869 --> 15:11.109
you were flirting with my
future girlfriend named Taylor.

15:11.172 --> 15:13.842
Actually, I was talking
to my future boyfriend,

15:14.026 --> 15:16.026
who happens to be 5'10".

15:16.051 --> 15:18.799
Just like the other 8% of
women in Tacoma, you mean?

15:18.926 --> 15:20.636
Where do you get these statistics from?

15:20.638 --> 15:23.171
- Oh, is that Joe Biden?
- You ... Get out of here, man!

15:23.173 --> 15:24.725
Stop flirting with my girl.

15:25.015 --> 15:26.090
Taylor's mine.

15:26.794 --> 15:27.861
She's mine!

15:28.198 --> 15:29.829
Oh. Oho, oh.

15:30.178 --> 15:31.576
Oh, you thirsty, boys?

15:32.207 --> 15:33.528
Oh, drink that in.

15:33.982 --> 15:35.213
So wet.

15:35.987 --> 15:37.389
Wet and juicy.

15:37.901 --> 15:39.081
I got juicy knees.

15:39.723 --> 15:41.529
Hey... I got juicy knees.

15:41.792 --> 15:43.259
Goodbye, scaly skin.

15:43.261 --> 15:44.667
Creamy McConky.

15:45.129 --> 15:47.346
Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup!

15:48.636 --> 15:49.916
Where have you been all my life?

15:50.334 --> 15:51.467
Thanks, Swisshelm!

15:59.588 --> 16:01.713
Whoa, see, I told you
that was a bad idea.

16:01.747 --> 16:03.002
Shh! Where is it?

16:03.884 --> 16:06.152
- Do you think he locks this?
- Here, here, here, here. I got it.

16:06.176 --> 16:08.334
- Let's go.
- Whoa, oh, oh, oh.

16:08.359 --> 16:09.959
- Hey.
- What are you guys doing in here?

16:10.078 --> 16:11.238
We're... We're looking for you.

16:11.262 --> 16:14.309
You know, see how, uh,
the, uh, Swisshelm was...

16:14.534 --> 16:16.348
- How's it... 
- Working out.

16:16.373 --> 16:17.462
You could have just asked me.

16:17.486 --> 16:18.533
- Yeah.
- Oh, how's it...

16:18.558 --> 16:19.958
- How's it working?
- Wait a minute.

16:20.035 --> 16:21.518
You guys were trying to
steal it, weren't you?

16:21.542 --> 16:23.475
- No way.
- You were doing something to it.

16:23.613 --> 16:25.947
Why would we replace it
with anything or do anything?

16:25.988 --> 16:27.645
You were pranking the chief's lotion.

16:27.670 --> 16:29.603
- I never did that in my day.
- Oh!

16:29.634 --> 16:31.270
- That's some big balls you guys got.
- Yeah.

16:31.294 --> 16:32.675
You guys got big balls.

16:34.334 --> 16:36.533
You guys are flying a little
too close to the sun, huh?

16:36.719 --> 16:38.119
- Yeah.
- Okay.

16:38.144 --> 16:39.702
- You got us.
- All right.

16:39.950 --> 16:42.231
I tell you what... you
got to wake up pretty early

16:42.256 --> 16:45.048
in the morning to put one
over on old Creamy McConky.

16:45.819 --> 16:47.419
Hey, Chief, I don't
know if you... you...

16:47.736 --> 16:49.426
- Dismissed!
- Okay, thanks.

16:50.860 --> 16:52.378
Station 24 to Dispatch.

16:52.403 --> 16:53.926
This is Lucy and Granny.

16:53.951 --> 16:55.285
We were wondering if
we could get an address

16:55.309 --> 16:57.830
on that busted power
line from earlier today.

16:58.332 --> 17:00.419
Checking. One moment please.

17:01.789 --> 17:03.054
And how's your week been?

17:03.267 --> 17:05.791
Oh, you know how it is when
it's that time of the month.

17:06.736 --> 17:07.823
Payday!

17:08.097 --> 17:09.097
So...

17:09.751 --> 17:11.199
what are your co-workers like?

17:11.506 --> 17:13.035
Oh! Darn it!

17:13.060 --> 17:14.233
I just sat on my nuts!

17:15.820 --> 17:18.469
Come on. I was saving
those almonds for later.

17:19.343 --> 17:20.670
That doesn't help us at all.

17:21.244 --> 17:22.497
I've got an idea.

17:22.728 --> 17:23.911
Start the car.

17:28.547 --> 17:29.648
All righty.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.318
Think you're gonna prank the chief, huh?

17:33.966 --> 17:35.574
I'll show you how to prank somebody.

17:36.612 --> 17:37.877
You guys are amateurs.

17:38.045 --> 17:39.046
You don't prank the chief.

17:39.070 --> 17:40.553
Nobody pranks the chief, okay?

17:43.790 --> 17:46.126
Hey, guys, guys! Come here! Come here!

17:47.270 --> 17:49.274
- What's up?
- I was making some sandwiches,

17:49.299 --> 17:50.365
and I made a few extra.

17:50.618 --> 17:51.708
Don't you hate when that happens?

17:51.732 --> 17:53.635
And, uh, I was thinking maybe you guys

17:53.660 --> 17:55.595
might like to eat them, hmm?

17:56.410 --> 17:58.210
Yeah, they're great.
They're really delicious.

17:58.531 --> 17:59.731
Seriously, sit down right now.

18:00.370 --> 18:01.466
- I could eat.
- Take a bite.

18:01.490 --> 18:02.505
Take a bite. They're really good.

18:02.529 --> 18:03.788
Delicious sandwiches right there.

18:03.812 --> 18:05.092
Hey. Bite them at the same time.

18:05.204 --> 18:06.204
That's always fun.

18:06.229 --> 18:07.383
You want us to bite
them at the same time?

18:07.407 --> 18:09.070
- Like friends.
- Okay.

18:12.060 --> 18:14.327
Ah! I got you guys!

18:14.472 --> 18:15.502
- That's not mayo.
- What?

18:15.527 --> 18:16.612
It's lotion!

18:16.637 --> 18:17.836
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

18:17.952 --> 18:19.952
I put the Swisshelm cream on there!

18:19.977 --> 18:20.984
That's a horrible prank!

18:21.009 --> 18:22.239
- Oh, man!
- It tastes like...

18:22.264 --> 18:24.033
- Oh, yeah.
- ... lotion in my mouth.

18:24.058 --> 18:25.835
- Oh, man.
- Oh, you guys are idiots!

18:25.950 --> 18:26.950
Come on!

18:27.157 --> 18:29.196
Ohh! Man!

18:29.447 --> 18:30.455
- Egh!
- Hey.

18:30.480 --> 18:31.796
That's why you
don't prank the chief.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.874
'Cause the chief gonna
prank you 10 times harder.

18:33.899 --> 18:35.766
- Man, you got us, Chief.
- Oh, man.

18:35.930 --> 18:37.263
- Idiots.
- Yeah.

18:37.288 --> 18:39.795
- Oh, I'm gonna feel sick for a while.
- Gross!

18:42.320 --> 18:43.384
Pretty good sandwich, though.

18:43.408 --> 18:44.756
Yeah, it's not bad, actually.

18:54.305 --> 18:56.172
Guess my brother isn't
the deviant scumbag

18:56.174 --> 18:57.558
I thought he was.

18:59.177 --> 19:00.309
Hmm.

19:06.585 --> 19:08.505
What do you think,
lawn boy? You thirsty?

19:08.864 --> 19:10.609
- Parched.
- Ohh.

19:11.490 --> 19:12.506
You got something?

19:12.657 --> 19:13.974
I'd like you to mow me.

19:19.330 --> 19:20.337
Oh!

19:23.534 --> 19:25.383
- Take me. Take me!
- I'm taking you.

19:31.836 --> 19:33.264
He has got to be in here.

19:33.612 --> 19:35.034
I'm sure she is.

19:35.280 --> 19:37.947
Dispatch to Engine 3.
Commercial fire alarm at...

19:37.949 --> 19:40.033
2-7-1... 84th and Mastery.

19:40.311 --> 19:41.311
It's her?

19:41.336 --> 19:44.069
Engine 8, Engine 14,
switch to channel 3.

19:44.190 --> 19:47.746
We have a gas leak at an
apartment complex at 2381

19:47.780 --> 19:49.936
- Wilson Avenue.
- It's him?

19:49.961 --> 19:51.813
Vehicle accident, multiple cars...

19:52.048 --> 19:53.833
... westbound on West Valley Highway.

19:54.056 --> 19:55.476
How do they all sound like Taylor?

19:55.566 --> 19:58.011
Excuse me. Is there a
Taylor who works here?

19:58.036 --> 19:59.702
Oh, you must mean the TAYLOR...

19:59.916 --> 20:02.877
Tacoma Automated Linguistic
Optimization Robot.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.974
- What?
- All the dispatchers' voices

20:04.976 --> 20:06.614
are run through that synthesizer.

20:06.711 --> 20:08.978
They found that firefighters'
response times are shorter

20:08.980 --> 20:10.400
when we're unidentifiable.

20:10.670 --> 20:12.381
We've actually been
having a pretty good time

20:12.383 --> 20:13.449
with the anonymity.

20:14.324 --> 20:16.603
Damn it. I just sat on my nuts.

20:18.122 --> 20:20.130
I was saving those almonds for later.

20:23.030 --> 20:24.904
These boobs are killing me.

20:24.929 --> 20:26.787
I work with a bunch of morons.

20:27.196 --> 20:30.871
Ooh, Ken, this is Paramedic Smith!

20:33.765 --> 20:36.893
Oh, welcome to the
science lab, lover boy.

20:37.408 --> 20:40.875
McConky, which one of us
sounds like Joe Biden now, huh?

20:41.677 --> 20:44.123
Hey, McConky, don't forget to vote.

20:45.884 --> 20:48.730
Station 24, medical
emergency... broken hip.

20:48.841 --> 20:50.953
21219 Proctor Avenue.

20:50.955 --> 20:52.170
Come on, man. That's us.

20:52.357 --> 20:54.108
Hey, just so you guys
know, it's not cool to mess

20:54.132 --> 20:55.246
with people's feelings.

20:57.305 --> 20:59.725
- It's totally cool.
- Totally cool.

21:03.835 --> 21:05.115
Why was she naked? I don't know.

21:05.515 --> 21:07.342
I don't know, I was out,
here mowing the lawn.

21:07.681 --> 21:09.438
It's not against the
law for a senior citizen

21:09.440 --> 21:10.920
to walk around naked in her own home.

21:11.086 --> 21:13.146
- You know that, right?
- Cap, I know that, yeah.

21:13.449 --> 21:16.606
How'd she break her hip?

21:17.034 --> 21:20.485
I don't know. I-I was out
here, okay, remember?

21:20.510 --> 21:22.651
And I heard what sounded like
somebody stepping on a twig,

21:22.653 --> 21:25.121
and then I turned around, and
there she was with a broken hip.

21:25.146 --> 21:28.147
Ohhh.

21:29.367 --> 21:30.375
Chunky.

21:36.848 --> 21:38.044
Look at how shiny he is.

21:38.069 --> 21:39.529
- Is he sweating?
- Ohh.

21:39.604 --> 21:40.870
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?

21:40.872 --> 21:42.605
I think the question is,
what's Eddie doing here?

21:42.607 --> 21:43.940
Yeah. I mean, how can you hear

21:43.942 --> 21:46.809
the sound of a twig
snap while she's inside?

21:46.811 --> 21:48.611
I'm... I'm the one that's
traumatized here, okay?

21:48.613 --> 21:49.660
- Like... 
- Hey.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.258
What the hell is wrong with you?

21:51.282 --> 21:52.976
Having sex with a
73-year-old woman?

21:53.001 --> 21:54.594
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

21:55.081 --> 21:56.223
Whoa!

21:56.487 --> 21:57.501
Is that what happened?

21:57.606 --> 21:59.431
- No.
- She's got osteoporosis.

21:59.456 --> 22:01.068
Why would you put her in
that kind of a position?

22:01.092 --> 22:02.825
Oh, what position?
Missionary fifth base?

22:02.974 --> 22:04.804
- Nice.
- I was just doing what she wanted.

22:04.829 --> 22:06.283
She's dying, okay?

22:06.364 --> 22:07.521
Actually, I'm not.

22:07.815 --> 22:09.766
I just say that to all
my naive boy toys.

22:09.768 --> 22:10.900
Oh! Hey-o!

22:10.902 --> 22:13.315
Hey, EMT man, I like your tight pants.

22:13.504 --> 22:14.971
- They look good.
- Wow.

22:14.973 --> 22:16.105
- Wow.
- Get it, girl.

22:16.130 --> 22:18.266
- She don't stop.
- Oh.

22:18.509 --> 22:19.909
Chief does not look good.

22:19.911 --> 22:22.347
Oh, man. We got to say something.
You got to say something.

22:22.647 --> 22:23.807
Hey, Chief.

22:24.237 --> 22:25.268
- Dad!
- Chief!

22:25.293 --> 22:26.360
- Oh, my God!
- No, no, no.

22:26.385 --> 22:27.785
We're taking this one to the grave.

22:28.097 --> 22:29.554
Chief? Did you trip or something?

22:35.992 --> 22:37.891
That's a virulent strain of salmonella.

22:38.614 --> 22:40.935
I bet I got lotion on that sandwich.

22:40.960 --> 22:41.960
Mnh, no, honey.

22:41.998 --> 22:43.866
You can't get salmonella from lotion.

22:43.868 --> 22:44.934
Yes, you can.

22:44.936 --> 22:46.336
I used that lotion all day long,

22:46.338 --> 22:48.997
and then I was fainting,
and I was puking.

22:49.292 --> 22:51.382
And the last time I
fainted, I had a vision...

22:51.943 --> 22:54.272
I was visited by this guy... St. Ives,

22:54.657 --> 22:56.339
the patron saint of dry skin.

22:56.553 --> 22:59.307
And he said I dishonored him,
so that's got to mean something.

23:00.229 --> 23:01.786
- We're gonna head out, Chief.
- All right, see you, pal.

23:01.810 --> 23:03.077
Wait, guys. Just hold on.

23:05.833 --> 23:09.625
I just want to say I-I'm feeling
an enormous amount of remorse

23:09.627 --> 23:11.227
- for what I did to you guys.
- What?

23:11.229 --> 23:13.495
No, don't worry about it, Chief, please.

23:13.497 --> 23:15.431
I fed you guys a lotion sandwich.

23:15.433 --> 23:16.699
- Oh, yeah, right.
- One sandwich.

23:16.701 --> 23:18.581
I mean, I've eaten weirder
sandwiches than that.

23:18.915 --> 23:20.770
I mean, you could be
laying here right now.

23:24.343 --> 23:26.771
- Ohh. God.
- Yeah.

23:26.845 --> 23:28.162
You should rest.

23:28.380 --> 23:29.400
Ohh.

23:30.715 --> 23:33.042
And I shouldn't have done
it, and I'm sorry about that.

23:33.067 --> 23:34.646
- We're over it.
- We're fine.

23:36.031 --> 23:37.096
Can you forgive me?

23:37.121 --> 23:39.081
We forgive you, Chief,
all right? Just get better.

23:39.391 --> 23:40.590
- Let's go.
- It was Andy's idea.

23:40.592 --> 23:41.924
He switched your lotion for mayo.

23:41.926 --> 23:43.059
I didn't want to do it,
but he wanted to do it.

23:43.061 --> 23:44.194
I'm so sorry!

23:44.196 --> 23:45.195
I thought we were going
to the grave with that.

23:45.197 --> 23:46.196
No, you said that. You said that.

23:46.198 --> 23:48.130
- I did for both of us.
- Mayo?

23:48.132 --> 23:49.799
I mean, how do we know it's the mayo?

23:49.801 --> 23:51.467
Of course it was the mayo.

23:51.469 --> 23:52.869
There's eggs in mayo.

23:52.871 --> 23:54.061
We didn't know that
there was eggs in mayo.

23:54.085 --> 23:55.290
No, there's not eggs in mayo.

23:55.315 --> 23:56.910
You gave your chief salmonella?

23:57.354 --> 23:58.877
- Not on purpose.
- We didn't try to...

23:58.902 --> 24:00.035
Okay. Your blood pressure's gonna rise.

24:00.059 --> 24:01.788
- Let's calm down.
- Get me out of this bed.

24:01.813 --> 24:03.012
No. No, no. You shouldn't get up.

24:03.014 --> 24:04.814
I'm gonna get some bacteria on you guys.

24:06.551 --> 24:07.638
Ohh.

24:08.191 --> 24:09.194
He's gone.

24:09.671 --> 24:12.399
It smells funny. Is he dead?

24:12.424 --> 24:15.157
You guys, get the hell out of
here before he wakes up, please.
