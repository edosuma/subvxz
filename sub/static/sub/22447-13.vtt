-Is she?
-No, of course not.

20:24.750 --> 20:26.880
She seemed
pretty real, though.

But didn't you notice,
how when you're holding
your card,

20:29.250 --> 20:30.790

20:30.790 --> 20:33.120

does at random.

And then after,
once you've read out
your question,

20:35.710 --> 20:38.380
that's when she goes,
"Oh, by the way, P.S."

20:38.380 --> 20:42.120
Yes, Cyrus!
That's exactly what she did.

It's a great bracelet.

want it anymore.

The drawing of me
that you gave me?

40:24.330 --> 40:27.920
Yeah, um, it probably
sounds kind of stupid,

40:27.920 --> 40:31.670
but I just want to remember
the moment I met you.

40:44.620 --> 40:47.960
You don't have to wear this...

40:47.960 --> 40:50.960
Both:
Every day!

40:50.960 --> 40:52.830
(both laughing)

40:56.880 --> 40:58.880
Cyrus, you never told me
that your bar mitzvah

40:58.880 --> 41:00.880
was gonna be this amazing.

41:00.880 --> 41:02.920
Yes, I did, many times.

41:05.380 --> 41:07.540

41:17.000 --> 41:19.920
Andi:
"There are only two things
I need in this life:

41:19.920 --> 41:24.380
"the universe, and you.

41:25.960 --> 41:28.580
"And I could live
without the universe.

41:29.790 --> 41:32.000
But I could not live
without you."

41:34.290 --> 41:36.960
I'm gonna call him
and ask him to come over
right now.

41:36.960 --> 41:40.830
Please don't.
I consumed an entire
dessert table.

41:40.830 --> 41:45.040
My body is very angry.
It refuses to think
or move.

41:45.040 --> 41:47.120
I have an idea.

41:47.120 --> 41:50.120
"Act as if"
you didn't eat anything.

41:50.120 --> 41:52.960
Please see me tomorrow
for my snappy comeback.

41:52.960 --> 41:54.620
(groans)

41:54.620 --> 41:56.420
(knocking on door)

41:56.420 --> 41:58.830
Who is it?
They can't come in.

42:06.040 --> 42:07.960
(sighs)
It's Jonah.

42:07.960 --> 42:10.620
Throw a blanket over me
and pretend I'm laundry.

42:22.540 --> 42:23.580
Hi.

42:24.750 --> 42:25.750
Hi.

42:28.420 --> 42:31.580
-Hi, Bex.
-That's... my laundry.

42:31.580 --> 42:32.830
Bex:
Hi, Jonah.

42:32.830 --> 42:34.830
It talks.

42:36.000 --> 42:39.040
I know it's late.
But something happened today

42:39.040 --> 42:40.750
I have to tell you about.

42:42.210 --> 42:43.880
Okay.

42:43.880 --> 42:45.330
(sighs)

42:48.290 --> 42:49.880
(door closes)

42:54.210 --> 42:55.960
What is it?

42:59.540 --> 43:01.120
I made a mistake.

43:03.080 --> 43:05.790
Andi, I want us
to be together.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.790
I-- I know what I said.

43:09.790 --> 43:13.580
But please, can you forget
I ever said it?

43:16.420 --> 43:18.000
I want you to be
my girlfriend.

43:19.420 --> 43:21.250
And I want to be your boyfriend.

43:22.580 --> 43:24.670
I want us to be a couple.

43:29.620 --> 43:31.380
What do you think?

43:35.210 --> 43:36.920
Um...

43:38.290 --> 43:39.670
Jonah:
Um?

43:41.330 --> 43:42.710
Jonah:
Next, on Andi Mack...

43:42.710 --> 43:45.080
Andi and her friends
stopped coming to The Spoon,

43:45.080 --> 43:47.420
because they were afraid
I might sit down and talk
to them.

43:47.420 --> 43:48.880
That didn't happen.

43:48.880 --> 43:50.540
I don't want to be
the mean girl!

43:50.540 --> 43:52.670
I think I might be able
to fix that.

43:52.670 --> 43:54.000
-I just want to get this--
-Let me help you!

43:54.000 --> 43:55.330
-Aah--
-(gasps)

43:55.330 --> 43:56.500
I'm moving.

43:56.500 --> 43:58.500
There must be something
we can do.

43:58.500 --> 43:59.920
I got it!

43:59.920 --> 44:01.380
Oh my gosh!

44:01.380 --> 44:05.080
I can't believe it took me
this long to think of this!

44:05.080 --> 44:07.580
I just went into the Fringe
to get something that made me
think of you.

44:07.580 --> 44:10.080
Some people just aren't good
at giving presents.

44:10.080 --> 44:13.250
That was the wrong present
but this is the right one.

44:13.250 --> 44:15.420
You got me another present.

44:15.420 --> 44:17.620
-Open it.
-Right now?
