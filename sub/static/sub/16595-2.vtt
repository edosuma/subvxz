00:04.872 --> 00:06.605
Hey, Joe,
you're a car guy.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.340
What do you think
of self-driving cars?

00:08.342 --> 00:09.942
I don't like 'em.

00:09.944 --> 00:11.410
I mean, you don't know
who to give the finger to.

00:13.180 --> 00:16.315
All right, gentlemen,
Broncos-Chargers game

00:16.317 --> 00:18.951
this Sunday,
Mike's house, right?

00:18.953 --> 00:20.352
Any questions?

00:20.354 --> 00:21.687
I got one.
Yeah?

00:21.689 --> 00:24.456
Did you just invite people
to<i> my</i> house?

00:24.458 --> 00:26.992
Yeah, well, that's where we watched
the Chargers game last season.

00:26.994 --> 00:28.861
The Broncos went on
to win the Super Bowl,

00:28.863 --> 00:31.296
so this year, we're going to do
everything the same way.

00:31.298 --> 00:32.698
Sounds like fun.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.967
Yeah, but not for you.
You're not coming.

00:34.969 --> 00:37.169
I'm sorry.
You weren't there last year.

00:37.171 --> 00:38.804
It's my house.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.806
If I don't want Joe there,
it's not because he's bad luck.

00:40.808 --> 00:42.174
It's because
I don't like him.

00:43.844 --> 00:46.311
Now I know
who to give the finger to.

00:46.313 --> 00:47.946
You're coming.

00:47.948 --> 00:51.517
But if the Broncos lose,
it's your ass.

00:51.519 --> 00:54.086
All your superstitions
make me nervous.

00:54.088 --> 00:56.422
Nobody breathes
between downs.

00:56.424 --> 00:59.525
Last year, I blacked out
and knocked over the end table.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.960
You'll need to do that again
this year.

01:01.962 --> 01:05.164
You know, Ed,
your rituals are insane.

01:05.166 --> 01:09.001
There's only one reason why the
Broncos are gonna win tomorrow.

01:09.003 --> 01:12.504
I control the game
with my mind.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.840
Wait a minute. Are you
one of those people

01:14.842 --> 01:16.608
who can control things with your mind?
Yes, Joe.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.811
What do you call that?
Tele-- Tele--

01:18.813 --> 01:21.213
Tele-nutcase. Tele-nutcase.
Let's go with that.

01:21.215 --> 01:22.714
You want proof?

01:22.716 --> 01:25.451
Remember Prater's
record 64-yard field goal?

01:25.453 --> 01:27.853
It wasn't him.
All me.

01:27.855 --> 01:29.021
Boom!

01:29.023 --> 01:30.656
Ooh!

Morning. Just wanted to give
you guys these invites

01:32.526 --> 01:34.460
to the wedding shower.

01:34.462 --> 01:37.129
(chuckles) I just heard you say
"guys" and "wedding shower"

01:37.131 --> 01:38.330
in the same sentence.

01:38.332 --> 01:40.265
Yeah. You are all invited.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.334
It is a Jack and Jill shower.

01:42.336 --> 01:44.036
Who's Jack and Jill?

01:45.339 --> 01:47.606
It's a wedding shower
for the bride<i> and</i> the groom.

01:47.608 --> 01:51.176
We'll talk, play games.
It's gonna be great!

01:51.178 --> 01:52.878

I don't even know these people.

It's Kyle and Mandy.

02:01.021 --> 02:02.988
My wife wants us to go,
we're going.

02:14.969 --> 02:17.636

would be beautiful.

02:18.672 --> 02:19.938
Yes, they would.

So what makes it cruel?

02:24.211 --> 02:29.248
You can't staple lace

You know, I just read
to take the stress off showers,

02:46.333 --> 02:48.267
people are having them
on Wednesdays.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.635
Uh, no.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.103
Sunday's the only day
we could do it,

02:51.105 --> 02:52.704

02:52.706 --> 02:54.973
Yeah, oh, and Chuck, Joe, and Ed
are all coming, too, right?

'Cause you can never have
too many people

Seriously, somebody
tell me that, right now.

Yeah, they're coming, and they're
-- they're real excited about it.

03:05.019 --> 03:06.585
So am I.
Really?

03:06.587 --> 03:08.086
Even though the Broncos
are playing that day?

03:08.088 --> 03:11.190
Wow. Has football season
started already?

Yeah, um...

Hi.

How was laser tag?

03:22.703 --> 03:24.770
Oh, great.
Ryan was an animal.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.338
Took out
a whole pack of 8-year-olds,

03:26.340 --> 03:27.940
including
the birthday boy.

03:30.110 --> 03:32.211
Yeah. I waited
for his mom to come comfort him,

03:32.213 --> 03:34.313
and that's
when I dropped her.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.281
(laughs)

03:36.283 --> 03:39.017
I wasn't listening to any
of that, but great story, guys.

Um, can we please
get back to my shower?

03:41.789 --> 03:46.158
It's actually not<i> your</i> shower.
It's for you and Kyle.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.759
You share
the spotlight equally.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.962
Mike, I see
what you're doing.

03:49.964 --> 03:52.197
Uh, so do I,
and God bless him.

03:52.199 --> 03:54.433
I'm the bride. I don't want to
share the spotlight.

03:54.435 --> 03:57.169
Well, it's a --
it's a Jack and Jill shower,

03:57.171 --> 04:00.706
so, legally,

04:00.708 --> 04:04.509
you have to give
half the attention to Kyle.

04:04.511 --> 04:07.012
How did I
not see that before?

04:07.014 --> 04:10.115
Sweetie, would you be
horribly disappointed

04:10.117 --> 04:12.351
if I forbid you from
coming to our shower? Ohh.

04:14.355 --> 04:17.990
I'd never be horrible
at being disappointed.

04:17.992 --> 04:20.425
That's the upside
to having awful parents.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.494
Mandy, no. No, no, no.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.296
Kyle is not
going to lose out

04:24.298 --> 04:25.497
just because your dad
doesn't want to go to a party.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.165
Come on, come on.

04:27.167 --> 04:29.034
Well, we could always do
something for Kyle at my place.

04:29.036 --> 04:33.038
Yes!
That would be a good idea.

You promise me.

Hey, you guys
are pretty good.

this insanity's ending.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.492
Game's starting
in 5 minutes.

09:54.494 --> 09:56.928
Now, now, Mike.
This is Kyle's special day.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.430
We can do whatever he wants.

09:58.432 --> 10:01.032
Kyle, have you had
enough of this crap? Really?

10:01.034 --> 10:02.500
We've been watching
the Broncos games

10:02.502 --> 10:03.835
since you started
dating Mandy.

10:03.837 --> 10:07.539
I know. How cool is that? Great.

10:07.541 --> 10:10.275
But it was really nice of Ryan
to do all this.

10:10.277 --> 10:13.778
Fine. It'll be a great memory
for all of us.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.147
Well, why can't we have a butler
and watch the game?

10:16.149 --> 10:17.415
Then everybody wins.

10:17.417 --> 10:20.852
Kyle, it's your day,
your decision.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.654
And I don't want to tell you
what to do, Kyle,

10:22.656 --> 10:24.356
but I just want
to point out

10:24.358 --> 10:26.358
how fun it is
to see Mike this mad.

10:26.360 --> 10:31.329
I'd like to take another crack
at guessing what's in that sock.

I say we watch the game.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.368
Yes!

10:36.370 --> 10:37.936
Unbelievable.
Oh, come on!

Now,<i> this</i>
is a bridal shower.

to have this many friends.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.120

at my wedding shower --

10:55.122 --> 10:59.524

Kristin, come here.

I'm going to be smiling so people
think we're sharing a moment,

11:02.929 --> 11:04.529
but a story
about your wedding shower

11:04.531 --> 11:06.197
doesn't sound like
it's about me.

(laughs loudly)

11:08.602 --> 11:10.135
I love you.

Hey, right, guys.
Time for a shower game.

11:12.939 --> 11:15.674
It's called
"Watch Eve eat."

11:15.676 --> 11:17.375
There's also food
in the kitchen

11:17.377 --> 11:19.944

wouldn't fit in the freezer,

11:19.946 --> 11:22.781

were in the red zone,

Okay.

All right. And you --
you were sitting right here.

Touchdown!
That's a touchdown!

That was all you, baby.

What are you talking about?
What did I do?

12:02.923 --> 12:05.757
Save it for the second half,
now. Just...

Okay. This is really fun,
but I can't stay.

to overstate this,

of the city of Denver,

12:18.105 --> 12:20.438
and our brave men and women
overseas,

I'm convinced of it.

Millions of people
are counting on you.

Okay. I'll stay.

Great. Great. Great.

And last year you kept
cracking your knuckles.

Please do that again.

No, that's not me.
That's Eve.

Don't be upset.

12:59.345 --> 13:01.044
One of us
had to get our way.

13:01.046 --> 13:03.046
Are you really surprised
it was me?

13:03.048 --> 13:05.882
You know, I was just
trying to stand up for Kyle.

13:05.884 --> 13:08.185
But, as usual, he just caved
to whatever you wanted.

13:08.187 --> 13:10.153
He didn't cave.
He showed a little respect.

13:10.155 --> 13:11.688
It'll be nice to have
a son-in-law

13:11.690 --> 13:13.156
that actually does that.

13:13.158 --> 13:15.892
Yeah, exactly. He's gonna be
your son-in-law, okay?

13:15.894 --> 13:17.661
And that respect
will turn to resentment

13:17.663 --> 13:19.162

calling the shots

13:19.164 --> 13:21.131
on something bigger
that just some stupid shower.

Listen,

13:22.568 --> 13:24.401
if Kyle decides
to resent me,

13:24.403 --> 13:26.136
I'll just say,
"Hey, Kyle...

13:26.138 --> 13:28.839
don't do that."

13:28.841 --> 13:31.308
Yep. I bet you will,
because you don't respect him.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.143
I respect him.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.112
Maybe you forgot that I asked him
if he wanted to watch the game.

13:35.114 --> 13:37.014
Come on. No, you didn't. You
totally pressured him into it.

13:37.016 --> 13:40.484
You were like, "Kyle, you had
enough of this crap, right?"

13:40.486 --> 13:42.819
Okay. First,
I'm going to ignore

13:42.821 --> 13:45.122
that really bad impression
of me.

13:45.124 --> 13:46.523
And, second, you're wrong.

13:46.525 --> 13:48.725

since I didn't get my way,

13:51.230 --> 13:53.864

in the kitchen.

how<i> you</i> sound.

13:58.070 --> 14:00.737

That's right.

Wait till you see the interception I
have planned for the second half.

14:04.309 --> 14:06.043
I just hope
the Broncos appreciate

14:06.045 --> 14:08.445
what you do for them, sir.

14:08.447 --> 14:10.947
Well, you know, last year they
gave him a Super Bowl ring --

14:10.949 --> 14:13.817
Oh, no, wait.
Maybe I got that mixed up.

14:13.819 --> 14:15.452
Maybe they're winning
because of Kyle.

who gave up his shower.

I'm kind of tired
of this game.

14:25.998 --> 14:27.397
Let's play some shower games.
What do you think?

14:27.399 --> 14:29.533
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
that sounds good, Mr. B.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.201
Let's do it.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.703
You know, uh, second half's
always kind of a battle.

14:33.705 --> 14:35.238
Never mind.
Let's watch the game.

14:35.240 --> 14:38.408
I agree. The game it is.

14:38.410 --> 14:40.010
Nah, shower games.
Let's do that.

14:40.012 --> 14:41.845
Good idea.

14:41.847 --> 14:45.882
I-I'm confused.
Is -- Is this a shower game?

14:47.453 --> 14:48.885
What are you doing, Baxter?

14:48.887 --> 14:50.487
I'm just doing
what Kyle wants to.

14:50.489 --> 14:51.822
What do you want to do,
Kyle?

14:51.824 --> 14:54.491
I don't know.
Where'd we leave off?

14:54.493 --> 14:56.793
Look, if you don't care,
maybe you should just leave.

14:56.795 --> 14:58.528
And go where?

14:58.530 --> 15:01.565
Maybe you'll have to make
that decision all on your own.

I've ever seen.

What the hell's the matter
with you, Baxter?

15:19.518 --> 15:21.718
This day
was supposed to be about Kyle.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.920
Yeah, I know.

15:31.697 --> 15:33.730
I don't know
what happened.

15:33.732 --> 15:35.832
You know, I mean, I've heard
Mr. B. has a prickly side,

15:35.834 --> 15:38.902
but you never expect
to actually see it.

15:40.339 --> 15:43.073
Yeah, he hides that
pretty well.

15:43.075 --> 15:45.308
Look, it just sounded like
he wanted you to make a choice.

15:45.310 --> 15:48.512
Well, I was trying,
but he kept changing his mind.

15:48.514 --> 15:51.014
Kyle, look, you're going to
disagree with Mike, okay?

15:51.016 --> 15:53.450
It's okay. I disagree with him
all the time.

15:53.452 --> 15:56.386
Yeah,
but he doesn't like you.

15:56.388 --> 15:58.021
He respects me, okay?

15:58.023 --> 15:59.489
Because I'm not afraid
to tell him

15:59.491 --> 16:00.824
when something
he does bugs me.

16:00.826 --> 16:02.526
I don't think I can be
like you.

16:02.528 --> 16:03.894
You know, I mean, you know
most of the stuff that bugs you

16:03.896 --> 16:05.462
I don't even get.

16:05.464 --> 16:08.031

for the fish.

I am just saying that I know
where I stand with Mike.

16:14.373 --> 16:15.739
Okay? Which is why
I actually feel

16:15.741 --> 16:17.207
like I have a better
relationship with him

16:17.209 --> 16:18.842
than you do.

I'll kick your ass.

16:24.183 --> 16:26.183
Yes, he likes you a lot,

16:26.185 --> 16:27.817
but does he treat you
as an equal?

16:27.819 --> 16:30.020
I don't think I could ever be
equals with Mr. B.

16:30.022 --> 16:32.355
Well, the first step might be
to stop calling him Mr. B.

16:32.357 --> 16:34.057

he's still
gonna like you, okay?

16:38.730 --> 16:40.797
And, even better than that,
he will respect you.

Like me<i> and</i> respect me?

19:02.574 --> 19:05.942
Remember this?
It's called an on/off switch.

19:05.944 --> 19:09.679
Oh, and I start my car
with an actual key.

19:11.283 --> 19:13.316
Kyle, are you gonna say
something I don't like?

19:13.318 --> 19:15.518
Yeah, um...

19:17.556 --> 19:20.957
It's my day,
and I want to do shower games.

19:20.959 --> 19:23.360
Even though I really want
to watch the game,

19:23.362 --> 19:25.161
and I mean<i> really.</i>

19:25.163 --> 19:27.731
Yes, and might I add that
I am only disagreeing with you

19:27.733 --> 19:29.366
because I respect you.

19:29.368 --> 19:32.802
And I want you to respect me
and treat me as an equal.

19:32.804 --> 19:36.072
You really want to do this,
Kyle?

19:36.074 --> 19:37.240
Yes, I do...

19:37.242 --> 19:39.442
Mike.

19:39.444 --> 19:42.212
"Mike"?

19:42.214 --> 19:44.347
Oh, boy.

19:46.952 --> 19:48.718
I was right. This<i> is</i> good. Yeah.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.521
I'm glad you told me.
You're right to stand up to me.

19:51.523 --> 19:53.723
BOTH: Whaaaaat?

19:53.725 --> 19:55.859
If you're gonna be
my son-in-law,

19:55.861 --> 19:58.661
it's important that we're
up front with each other.

19:58.663 --> 20:00.797
This is
the best day ever!

20:00.799 --> 20:02.499
I told you.

20:02.501 --> 20:05.468
Yeah, okay. So, which shower
game should we play first?

20:05.470 --> 20:07.904
None.
We're gonna watch the game.

20:09.975 --> 20:13.276
But, you know,
I really respect what you did.

20:15.213 --> 20:17.046
Wait. But I didn't get
what I wanted.

20:17.048 --> 20:18.548
Yeah, congratulations.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.383
You're on the way
to having

20:20.385 --> 20:23.119
the same relationship
that I have with Mike.

20:23.121 --> 20:25.722
Except that I like him.

20:33.565 --> 20:36.132
(laughter)

20:36.134 --> 20:37.233
Hey!
Hi.

20:37.235 --> 20:38.668
Hey, guess what.

20:38.670 --> 20:41.204
I won the football game!

20:42.874 --> 20:45.141
She was unbelievable.

20:45.143 --> 20:47.076
She was asking stupid questions
the whole second half.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.480
Mandy and Kyle
will have a happy marriage

20:50.482 --> 20:52.115
because I brought pretzels.
Yep.

20:52.117 --> 20:53.483
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

20:53.485 --> 20:55.151
So, I could've
watched the game here

20:55.153 --> 20:57.454
instead of arm wrestling
the ballerinas at Ryan's house?

20:57.456 --> 21:00.457
Well, you know
what that means, Mikey.

21:00.459 --> 21:02.459
If we win
the Super Bowl again,

21:02.461 --> 21:06.696
you're gonna have to watch
the game every year at Ryan's.

21:06.698 --> 21:08.865
(Laughs)

21:08.867 --> 21:11.367
In that case, go Raiders!

21:11.369 --> 21:15.638
Hey, Mike can watch the game
wherever he wants, Ed.

21:22.447 --> 21:23.713
"Mike"?

21:23.715 --> 21:25.815
"Ed"?

21:25.817 --> 21:27.884
What the hell happened
over there?

21:34.226 --> 21:36.292
