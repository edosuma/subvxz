WEBVTT

00:03.237 --> 00:04.905
(Khadijah gasps)

00:04.938 --> 00:06.774
-My baby! No! No!
-SKULLY: You gonna have to get

00:06.807 --> 00:08.276
that hate out your heart.

00:08.309 --> 00:09.743
If it was me that got killed...

00:10.811 --> 00:11.912
...would you forgive?

00:11.912 --> 00:13.681
(gunshot)

00:13.747 --> 00:14.748
LOUIE:
If you kill us now...

00:16.117 --> 00:17.751
...it ain't gonna never end.

00:17.751 --> 00:20.754
Our people gonna come after you

00:20.788 --> 00:22.090
till there ain't nobody left.

00:23.324 --> 00:26.194
Thought we'd start off
with ten keys a week.

00:26.260 --> 00:28.262
You say you wanted to focus
on real estate.

00:28.296 --> 00:29.597
Y'all can't do what I do.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.299
We the ones that made it right
with Skully.

00:31.332 --> 00:35.269
Now we want to run
what's ours our way.

00:35.303 --> 00:36.937
BUCKLEY:
Well, unless you want to go bak

00:36.937 --> 00:39.207
to not having my protection,
I suggest you find

00:39.273 --> 00:40.341
somebody to serve up.

00:41.609 --> 00:43.544
My time now is being
in real estate with you.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.113
Grady's on our side,

00:45.113 --> 00:47.148
in legit business with us.

00:47.181 --> 00:49.117
He don't want anything bad
to happen to us.

00:49.150 --> 00:50.984
You sure you can work
with the asset?

00:51.018 --> 00:52.286
TEDDY: What,
you mean that I saved his ass

00:52.286 --> 00:53.887
with that reporter?

00:53.954 --> 00:55.556
See, I was thinking more
about what you did

00:55.623 --> 00:56.990
to his father in Cuba.

00:57.024 --> 00:58.792
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:58.792 --> 01:01.962
HAVEMEYER:
Get Grady in line,
but do it quietly.

01:01.995 --> 01:03.897
FRANKLIN:
Hey, Reed, Grady had agreed
to cut the prices down.

01:03.964 --> 01:05.799
$9,000 a kilo.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.335
I'm hoping you can honor that.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.069
Let's keep it at ten for now.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.971
Also, Reed's gone.

01:10.971 --> 01:12.806
From here on,
you can call me Teddy.

01:21.882 --> 01:24.818
-JEROME: Just like that?
-FRANKLIN: Just like that.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.187
LOUIE:
He say why?

01:28.055 --> 01:30.324
Said Grady was
reckless and wasteful

01:30.358 --> 01:33.161
and putting us all in jeopardy.

01:33.161 --> 01:34.695
And you believe him?

01:34.728 --> 01:36.697
Can't say Grady ran
the tightest ship.

01:36.730 --> 01:39.167
(takes deep breath)

01:39.167 --> 01:41.602
It was bound to hit the rocks
sooner or later.

01:41.669 --> 01:44.172
-What did Grady say?
-I don't know.

01:44.172 --> 01:47.007
His house is empty, and he
ain't answering my pages, so...

01:47.007 --> 01:49.009
JEROME:
So what you saying, nephew?

01:49.009 --> 01:52.213
-You think that Reed killed him?
-Teddy.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.382
-What?
-Said to call him Teddy
from here on out.

01:54.415 --> 01:57.017
And I don't know that, either.

01:57.017 --> 01:58.519
LOUIE:
You think Grady
just walked away

01:58.552 --> 02:00.621
from everything,
all y'all's business,

02:00.688 --> 02:02.856
without so much as a phone call?

02:02.890 --> 02:05.526
I think if the CIA shows up,
tells you it's over

02:05.526 --> 02:08.028
and you got to move on,
then that's exactly what you do.

02:08.061 --> 02:10.464
But yeah,
he could have killed him.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.300
Lions sometimes eat their young.

02:12.366 --> 02:13.967
I just can't think
of a lot of reasons

02:14.034 --> 02:15.369
why Teddy would've had to.

02:15.403 --> 02:17.371
I can. Saw you and Grady
was like Bert and Ernie

02:17.371 --> 02:19.373
-up in this motherfucker.
-(chuckles)

02:19.373 --> 02:20.974
Wanted to send a message
they knew you would hear.

02:21.041 --> 02:22.710
LOUIE:
You mean, in addition

02:22.710 --> 02:24.578
to disappearing his father?

02:24.612 --> 02:26.914
That come up
in your little chat?

02:26.947 --> 02:29.817
Whatever happened to Alton,
he did to himself.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.652
Bottom line is,
whoever the CIA sends,

02:31.719 --> 02:33.221
we got to do business with them.

02:33.221 --> 02:35.055
And that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

02:35.055 --> 02:37.258
Well, we can't do nothin'
without that price cut.

02:37.291 --> 02:40.093
-We still good on that?
-FRANKLIN: (sighs) No.

02:40.127 --> 02:41.229
Teddy's not gonna honor
Grady's word.

02:41.229 --> 02:42.563
Prices stay the same.

02:42.596 --> 02:45.566
I made promises.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.167
Well, you're gonna have
to break 'em.

02:47.235 --> 02:48.902
LOUIE: How about I take Teddy
on a little ride-along?

02:48.936 --> 02:51.839
Let him see how the Colombians
got the game sewed up.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.407
(chuckles)
Yeah, that'll do it.

02:53.441 --> 02:54.675
Me and him,
we did business for months

02:54.742 --> 02:56.076
when you was laid up.

02:56.109 --> 02:57.478
-Let me try and talk to him.
-I'll talk to him.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.349
Till then, y'all
just keep moving these keys.

03:01.415 --> 03:04.452
Now's not the time to tell Teddy
business is falling off.

03:04.485 --> 03:07.321
I'll let you all know more
when I do.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.791
*

03:16.764 --> 03:19.132
(train whistle blowing)

03:19.166 --> 03:22.202
(lighter flicking)

03:22.270 --> 03:24.938
It ain't on us, they don't
like it, they don't like it.

03:24.938 --> 03:27.207
Fuck we gonna do?

03:27.275 --> 03:29.209
(hip hop music playing
over car radio)

03:29.277 --> 03:30.778
(tires squeal)

03:38.452 --> 03:40.187
-(engine shuts off)
-(music stops)

03:50.130 --> 03:52.500
My favorite people.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.802
-Looking well.
-Mello.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.472
What up with you, Mello?

03:58.506 --> 04:01.241
Shit, trying to get like y'all.

04:01.309 --> 04:02.843
You got it, boss.

04:04.211 --> 04:05.746
LOUIE:
Heads up.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.247
Couldn't get that price cut.

04:07.315 --> 04:09.583
It's not a call I could make.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.485
And for that I apologize.

04:13.654 --> 04:14.822
Well, see, now you put me--

04:14.855 --> 04:17.157
us--

04:17.157 --> 04:19.360
in a bad position.

04:19.393 --> 04:22.229
Hey, ease the fuck off
or shit get ugly.

04:23.531 --> 04:25.265
MELLO:
You see...

04:25.333 --> 04:27.267
I like this,

04:27.335 --> 04:29.603
but I'm not in charge.

04:29.670 --> 04:33.841
You know, just like you,
this is not a call I can make.

04:35.075 --> 04:38.846
And now I got to tell the man
who's in charge

04:38.846 --> 04:42.015
that things aren't as you said.

04:42.015 --> 04:45.453
Nah, fuck all that.
They can tell him.

04:45.519 --> 04:49.022
You know Skully; honor, God,
samurais, and fucking spirits.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.359
Oh, he not a fan
of niggas renegin'.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.394
You think there's gonna be
a problem?

04:53.427 --> 04:57.197
(exhales)
I can't call it, big dawg.

04:57.197 --> 04:59.633
You know,
he has good days and...

04:59.700 --> 05:02.470
he has real bad days.

05:02.536 --> 05:05.539
If you've got time,

05:05.573 --> 05:08.108
I'd pray for a good one.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.782
(train whistle blowing
in distance)

05:20.053 --> 05:22.490
(phone ringing)

05:22.556 --> 05:25.225
Ten grand? Yeah, all right.

05:25.258 --> 05:27.260
No, go ahead and do it.

05:27.294 --> 05:29.497
Send the invoice
to the business.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.064
Thanks.

05:33.401 --> 05:36.336
-New windshield.
-For the Cadillac?

05:36.404 --> 05:39.072
-For the plane.
-(laughing)

05:40.741 --> 05:42.175
(whispers):
Right.

05:42.242 --> 05:43.644
Mm-mm.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.080
Looking at me
like I owe you money.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.916
-(chuckles)
-I could you right now
I ain't got it.

05:48.916 --> 05:51.351
What I do got is paperwork.

05:51.419 --> 05:53.421
Your go-ahead for the bid.

05:53.421 --> 05:55.155
Less than 48 hours
to submit, huh?

05:56.424 --> 05:57.691
Yeah.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.693
All right,
I'll go through this tonight.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.430
-Mm-hmm.
-Finish it up tomorrow.

06:02.430 --> 06:05.132
In the meantime, I need you
to do something else for me.

06:05.165 --> 06:08.368
-What you need?
-Uh, we got to put Grady's house
on the market.

06:08.436 --> 06:10.438
(chuckles)

06:10.438 --> 06:12.205
I'm not surprised.

06:12.272 --> 06:14.207
He's got "rolling stone" written
all over him,

06:14.274 --> 06:15.976
and, you know,
they don't gather no moss.

06:16.009 --> 06:18.479
Grady's left town, V.

06:18.512 --> 06:21.815
-He's out.
-Mm.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.784
-(takes deep breath)
-Teddy's back in.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.385
Teddy?

06:25.453 --> 06:26.787
Reed.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.325
When'd this happen?

06:32.359 --> 06:34.127
Last night.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.799
You thought
he wasn't coming back.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.834
I was wrong.

06:42.169 --> 06:45.072
Okay.

06:45.138 --> 06:47.074
Well, did you ask him
about your dad,

06:47.140 --> 06:49.076
if he had anything to do
with it?

06:49.142 --> 06:50.978
Caught me a little off guard.

06:50.978 --> 06:52.813
That definitely wasn't
an accident.

06:59.653 --> 07:02.422
I'm not a mind reader,
so I'm gonna need you to tell me

07:02.490 --> 07:06.159
-how you're feeling, Franklin.
-(sighs)

07:06.159 --> 07:08.328
I think as long
as I've done right by Teddy,

07:08.328 --> 07:09.830
he's had my back.

07:09.863 --> 07:12.866
I asked how you felt,
not what you think.

07:15.503 --> 07:18.338
I don't know right now, babe.

07:18.371 --> 07:21.008
All I know is that he needs me.

07:21.041 --> 07:24.077
As long as I make him money,
we all good.

07:25.513 --> 07:27.848
That's all I got for now,
all right?

07:33.854 --> 07:34.922
(sighs)

07:36.223 --> 07:38.191
Truck outside.
I figured I'd bring it in.

07:38.225 --> 07:41.529
Aw, thank you, baby.
You didn't have to do that.

07:41.529 --> 07:43.797
I know, it's fine.

07:43.864 --> 07:46.900
-I had the time.
-(beeping)

07:49.269 --> 07:51.705
(sighs)

07:51.705 --> 07:54.908
Proverbs 25:14.

07:56.544 --> 07:59.146
A man that promises a gift

07:59.212 --> 08:01.749
and doesn't give
is like clouds...

08:01.782 --> 08:03.651
I'm guessing y'all ain't pray
for that good day.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.218
How bad?

08:05.218 --> 08:07.320
Tianna's-birthday-tomorrow bad.

08:07.387 --> 08:09.256
SKULLY:
Niggas need to see

08:09.289 --> 08:13.561
they consequences in action.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.162
He'd like to see you.

08:15.228 --> 08:16.964
-Now.
-(line clicks off)

08:20.934 --> 08:22.570
How much you hear?

08:22.603 --> 08:26.774
-Sounded like Old Testament
this time.
-Fuck.

08:33.146 --> 08:34.815
-(dog barking in distance)
-(man whistles)

08:36.750 --> 08:38.786
(siren wailing in distance)

08:41.488 --> 08:42.790
MAN:
Yo!

08:47.928 --> 08:50.798
You think this is a fucking
joke? This shit is for real.

08:50.831 --> 08:53.100
You don't fuck with the Bible,
motherfuckers.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.702
* And move your feet
to the beat *

08:54.768 --> 08:57.104
* And the feeling gets
much better *

08:57.104 --> 08:58.772
-* When you're feeling
the heat *
-(baby crying in distance)

08:58.806 --> 09:01.709
*

09:01.775 --> 09:04.945
* So get on up *

09:04.978 --> 09:06.814
*

09:08.015 --> 09:09.950
(door opens)

09:13.186 --> 09:16.056
I wouldn't bring heat
to the fire.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.826
I got enough heat to toast
this motherfucker if I need.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.195
(chuckles softly)

09:30.804 --> 09:32.472
* We're shakin' up
the party... *

09:32.472 --> 09:34.174
The fuck, homie?

09:34.207 --> 09:35.976
Hey, look, I ain't even
the nigga that lied.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.078
It was them marked-ass niggas.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.681
SKULLY:
False words, real consequences.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.750
CORNROWS:
No! (screaming)

09:42.816 --> 09:44.184
Fuck! Oh!

09:44.217 --> 09:46.186
-(yelling)
-Calm down, nigga.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.155
Shut up. Get your ass up

09:48.188 --> 09:49.990
and get that blood off my floor.

09:50.023 --> 09:52.993
It's over.
Listen close next time.

09:52.993 --> 09:55.095
Get this nigga out of here.

09:55.162 --> 09:57.698
(wailing in pain)

09:57.731 --> 10:01.835
And make sure he don't bleed
all over my baby's balloons.

10:03.070 --> 10:06.539
Thought we was on another plane.

10:06.573 --> 10:09.843
Thought we transcended
this bullshit.

10:09.877 --> 10:13.180
Now y'all want to sell me
wolf tickets again?

10:13.180 --> 10:14.848
What happened to the honor?

10:14.848 --> 10:16.850
Our business with you is
our honor.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.218
Our loyalty.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.520
Lying to me
ain't no motherfucking loyalty.

10:20.553 --> 10:22.222
LOUIE:
We didn't lie to you.

10:22.255 --> 10:25.859
We were told one thing,
then we were told another.

10:25.893 --> 10:28.195
-It's out of our hands.
-SKULLY: You know,

10:28.228 --> 10:29.963
Titi is in here.

10:30.030 --> 10:33.366
I ain't even supposed
to be carrying on like this.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.635
Ten a key--
that's what you said,

10:35.703 --> 10:39.239
-and that's what it's gonna be.
-Skully, we can't do that.

10:39.272 --> 10:40.874
SKULLY:
Man, you can do that!

10:40.874 --> 10:42.242
'Cause you said and you owe me.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.544
-You already know that.
-LOUIE: Okay.

10:44.544 --> 10:46.213
We'll do it.

10:46.213 --> 10:48.215
Daddy's sorry, baby.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.050
I don't mean to get loud.

10:51.284 --> 10:54.587
Hit y'all up later
to reschedule the drop

10:54.621 --> 10:56.556
after I deal with this shit.

11:00.093 --> 11:03.230
SKULLY: You know,
possums smell like shit

11:03.230 --> 11:06.399
when they tricking predators
into thinking they dead.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.168
But the smart ones

11:08.235 --> 11:11.604
don't play with
the same predator over and over,

11:11.638 --> 11:14.274
because they afraid he
might become wise to the smell.

11:14.307 --> 11:17.410
Did you smell anything on them?

11:17.444 --> 11:19.579
As in possum shit?

11:19.579 --> 11:23.616
As in, do what you say
and say what you mean,

11:23.650 --> 11:26.253
or you can't be trusted.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.521
-He comin' apart.
-With expenses,

11:28.588 --> 11:30.623
we out at least a few hundo
every bird we sell to him.

11:30.657 --> 11:33.093
We in business with a madman,

11:33.126 --> 11:35.095
and we ain't even making money
doing it.

11:35.128 --> 11:38.766
Way he goin',
ain't gonna be long.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.768
We can wait him out,
let him implode,

11:40.768 --> 11:42.970
wait for the next man to rise.

11:44.271 --> 11:45.438
I see your wheels turning.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.107
You notice Mello?

11:47.107 --> 11:49.276
-Itching.
-Uh-huh.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.811
We can use that.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.807
(traffic passing)

12:40.828 --> 12:42.195
(children chattering, laughing)

12:42.229 --> 12:43.897
Come on.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.000
-(school bell ringing)
-Come on, come on. We late.

12:53.841 --> 12:55.042
(car door closes)

12:56.343 --> 12:57.878
Come on.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.181
Wrong place to start some drama.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.350
Girl, ain't no drama.

13:05.052 --> 13:07.054
Y'all know Mello?

13:07.087 --> 13:08.856
Skully's boy.

13:08.856 --> 13:11.458
-Hey.
-Who don't?
He stay in the streets.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.460
Saw him yesterday buying
some Jordans at the Fox Hills.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.963
I heard he hang tough
over where y'all used to dance.

13:16.029 --> 13:18.231
-First Kings.
-BLACK DIAMOND: Used to?

13:18.265 --> 13:20.200
Nah. We can't gamble
feeding these babies

13:20.233 --> 13:23.070
-on no damn dope money.
-Might not always be sufficient.

13:23.103 --> 13:25.238
Well, we need somebody
to slide in his ear,

13:25.272 --> 13:29.042
-remind him of his potential.
-Y'all steady playing us
to the left.

13:29.042 --> 13:31.078
Maybe we just shoot you
in the stomach.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.546
-Play a game of spades after.
-BLACK DIAMOND: Look, I thought
we was past that

13:33.546 --> 13:35.648
-when y'all brought us on.
-You think I brought you on?

13:35.715 --> 13:37.650
If it was up to me...

13:37.717 --> 13:39.586
-We'd be dead. Right?
-DALLAS: Man, come on.

13:39.619 --> 13:42.222
why you bringing up old shit?

13:42.222 --> 13:44.257
We've been hospitable
as fuck since.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.059
-You stay trippin'.
-LOUIE: Call us past it

13:46.059 --> 13:47.660
if you help us out.

13:47.727 --> 13:49.729
You know somebody to do it?

13:51.598 --> 13:53.833
Puff The Magic Dragon.

13:53.901 --> 13:55.635
-JEROME: Who?
-We'll set it up.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.471
Come on, baby.

13:59.940 --> 14:04.277
(sighs)
Little late for this, but...

14:04.311 --> 14:06.579
I'm sorry for...

14:06.579 --> 14:08.748
shooting you and all.

14:09.950 --> 14:12.252
I'm glad you didn't not make it.

14:16.323 --> 14:18.458
I did it again.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.093
-(school bell ringing)
-BLACK DIAMOND: You gonna
be a good boy?

14:32.105 --> 14:33.941
Morning. Listen, um...

14:38.946 --> 14:41.114
FRANKLIN:
Had them get you some coffee.

14:41.114 --> 14:41.949
Okay.

14:43.450 --> 14:44.784
Thank you.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.789
(sighs)

14:50.790 --> 14:52.692
Stopped smoking, huh?

14:58.198 --> 15:01.168
So, I thought
maybe we should talk.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.903
Caught me a little off guard
the other day.

15:03.971 --> 15:05.305
So what?
So anything in particular

15:05.305 --> 15:06.673
-you want to talk about?
-Well, you know, I...

15:06.706 --> 15:09.076
For starters, I hate
to beat a dead horse here,

15:09.142 --> 15:11.078
but I think
maybe I wasn't clear

15:11.144 --> 15:12.645
about why that price cut's
so important.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.081
Oh, no, I understand

15:14.147 --> 15:16.316
why competitive pricing
is important.

15:16.316 --> 15:19.819
I just don't really think
that pricing is the issue here.

15:21.321 --> 15:23.823
So, for reasons that
I will never fully understand,

15:23.823 --> 15:28.195
in my absence, you decided
that you would make yourself

15:28.228 --> 15:32.099
a middleman
inside of your own organization.

15:32.165 --> 15:34.167
My prices,
right at market levels.

15:34.201 --> 15:36.269
I think the problem here is
the prices

15:36.336 --> 15:38.605
that Jerome and Louie
are paying you, right?

15:38.671 --> 15:41.508
So please,
in the future, feel free

15:41.541 --> 15:43.843
not to call me out here
and ask me to cut my margins

15:43.876 --> 15:46.013
and get people that are trying
to fight a war killed.

15:46.013 --> 15:48.215
Why don't you get your own house
in order first?

15:48.248 --> 15:49.516
Fair?

15:53.520 --> 15:55.622
But prices
aren't really the reason

15:55.688 --> 15:57.857
you asked me out here to talk,
are they?

15:59.526 --> 16:01.394
No, not really.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.700
(takes deep breath, chuckles)

16:07.700 --> 16:10.137
Come on, man,
you really gonna make me ask?

16:10.203 --> 16:13.106
I wish that I had something
for you here, man, I really do.

16:15.242 --> 16:17.710
The truth is, I have no idea
what's happened to Alton.

16:17.710 --> 16:21.248
He went after the CIA.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.715
He pissed off a lot of people,

16:22.715 --> 16:24.551
people that are way above
my pay grade, trust me.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.653
So what-what you saying?

16:26.719 --> 16:28.755
CIA went down there
and found him and what?

16:28.788 --> 16:30.223
Kidnapped him?

16:30.257 --> 16:33.060
-Killed him?
-You have to understand.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.828
The CIA, that's only part
of the equation here.

16:35.895 --> 16:38.765
From the minute your parents
touched down in Cuba,

16:38.798 --> 16:40.100
they would have been targeted

16:40.133 --> 16:42.735
by any number
of intelligence agencies.

16:42.769 --> 16:45.405
I'm talking about the DGI,
the KGB.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.740
And your father,
a former Panther,

16:47.774 --> 16:50.110
would've been what they called
a high-value target.

16:50.143 --> 16:52.912
But wouldn't they want
to use him? Turn him?

16:52.912 --> 16:54.747
A lot of times
it starts that way,

16:54.747 --> 16:58.918
but if he resists,
if he doesn't cooperate,

16:58.918 --> 17:00.853
then things can get out of hand.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.955
You know, or, I don't...

17:02.989 --> 17:04.757
(sighs)
You know,

17:04.791 --> 17:07.160
he could be in some
Cuban jail cell right now.

17:08.495 --> 17:11.464
I understand how hard...

17:11.498 --> 17:14.434
this must be.

17:14.434 --> 17:18.138
You spent all this time
hating him,

17:18.171 --> 17:20.440
and then you form a relationship
with him again, and...

17:20.473 --> 17:22.875
and he betrays you.

17:22.942 --> 17:25.112
And then this.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.948
Franklin...

17:28.981 --> 17:31.284
I swear to you, whatever
happened to your father,

17:31.318 --> 17:33.453
I had nothing to do with it.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.562
Anything else?

17:42.629 --> 17:43.963
Nah.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.135
That's it.

17:51.971 --> 17:54.141
Do me a favor.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.409
Don't ever come to my house
like that again

17:56.476 --> 17:58.811
or my place of business or
anywhere I'm not expecting you.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.813
Okay?

18:00.813 --> 18:02.315
(quietly):
Okay.

18:04.317 --> 18:06.686
Oh, by the way, I got ducks
to put in rows tonight,

18:06.719 --> 18:10.690
so Gustavo will meet you
for the exchange, same as ever.

18:12.359 --> 18:13.693
FRANKLIN:
Okay.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.699
(footsteps approaching)

18:34.381 --> 18:36.015
How'd it go with the Colombians?

18:37.250 --> 18:41.221
Pos iqual que siempre.

18:41.254 --> 18:44.123
So listen, I got a few things
I got to take care of tonight.

18:44.191 --> 18:47.093
So are you good to make the drop
with Franklin without me?

18:48.395 --> 18:50.863
Pos iqual que siempre.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.811
-(cheering, whooping)
-DEJAY: Two for one drinks

19:04.877 --> 19:06.746
-at the top of the hour.
Saddle up, boys.
-*

19:06.779 --> 19:10.149
The Sexy Stallion is coming up.

19:10.217 --> 19:12.319
* Lay some sugar on me *

19:12.385 --> 19:14.487
* Lay some sugar
on me *

19:14.554 --> 19:17.490
* Ooh, that sugar is sweet... *

19:17.557 --> 19:19.726
I missed that ass.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.093
Where you been?

19:21.127 --> 19:23.263
I only come
when it's worth my time.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.265
Heard you were here, so...

19:25.298 --> 19:28.568
-it's worth my time.
-Hmm.

19:28.601 --> 19:31.170
Heard you moved up.

19:31.238 --> 19:34.073
Working for ole boy
in Inglewood.

19:34.106 --> 19:35.608
I do not,

19:35.642 --> 19:39.078
nor will I ever work for anyone.

19:39.111 --> 19:40.947
So you're not his right hand?

19:43.450 --> 19:45.752
Enlighten me.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.255
What the fuck
is you really doing here?

19:49.589 --> 19:50.757
(sighs):
Mm...

19:52.124 --> 19:54.427
'Cause the boss is.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.095
DEJAY: She's got
that sauce, silettos and...

19:56.095 --> 19:57.930
* Lay some sugar on me *

19:57.930 --> 19:59.932
Take your fucking clothes off.

19:59.932 --> 20:02.302
I'll get in trouble.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.604
Baby, I thought you came
to fuck with a boss.

20:04.604 --> 20:06.606
* Lay some sugar on me *

20:06.639 --> 20:09.208
* Lay some sugar
on me *

20:09.276 --> 20:11.210
* Ooh, that sugar is sweet *

20:11.278 --> 20:13.946
* Ooh, that sugar is sweet... *

20:13.980 --> 20:15.782
(crowd chatter,
music playing in distance)

20:22.789 --> 20:24.891
Paid me an extra two grand
just to get naked.

20:24.957 --> 20:27.126
Definitely feeling himself.

20:29.496 --> 20:32.899
Don't act like y'all ain't
got me out here on a Tuesday.

20:32.965 --> 20:35.167
And you're so welcome.
(scoffs)

20:35.201 --> 20:37.304
-(mutters)
-Young bitches so ungrateful.

20:40.473 --> 20:44.176
(Peaches coughs, sniffs)

20:49.316 --> 20:50.683
(Peaches sniffs)

20:50.717 --> 20:52.485
You good?

20:52.519 --> 20:55.322
Yeah, yes. I...

20:55.322 --> 20:57.156
I don't think I'll ever get used
to all this shit.

20:57.156 --> 21:00.760
Yeah, I'm overdue a Panama run.

21:00.827 --> 21:03.496
Till then, don't get no idea.

21:03.530 --> 21:05.665
I like being alive
more than I like money.

21:05.698 --> 21:08.335
-Mm-hmm.
-Huh. (sniffs)

21:09.536 --> 21:12.171
-(coughing)
-Why don't you call it
after this?

21:12.204 --> 21:15.007
Ah, no, I'm good. Shit.

21:15.007 --> 21:16.509
It's not about you.

21:16.509 --> 21:19.045
Whatever you got, I don't want
to give it to Veronique.

21:19.078 --> 21:21.280
Head on home. Get better.

21:21.348 --> 21:23.550
I'll be fine.

21:23.583 --> 21:24.684
All right.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.021
-Uh-uh, nigga.
-(exhales)

21:29.021 --> 21:31.023
(Peaches coughing)

21:35.695 --> 21:38.798
(engine turns off)

21:38.865 --> 21:42.201
(horn blares in distance)

21:52.945 --> 21:54.781
(vehicle approaching)

22:02.254 --> 22:03.890
(engine shuts off)

22:06.759 --> 22:09.061
You alone?

22:09.095 --> 22:12.064
Yeah. Thought the two of us

22:12.098 --> 22:14.434
could spend
some quality time together.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.102
How's the family?

22:17.404 --> 22:20.272
(sighs)
Kids are a lot of work.

22:20.306 --> 22:22.742
(chuckles)
That's what they say.

22:24.777 --> 22:26.746
Worth it, though, right?

22:26.779 --> 22:28.347
A huevo.

22:28.415 --> 22:29.949
Huevo.

22:38.758 --> 22:41.794
What's up with the drop spot?

22:41.828 --> 22:45.264
Was it your idea or Teddy's?

22:45.297 --> 22:47.767
Not mine.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.436
You know he was coming back?

22:53.105 --> 22:54.306
What about Grady?

22:56.943 --> 23:00.346
If he did,
he didn't tell ni madres.

23:03.683 --> 23:05.985
Look, man, I don't mean
to put you in a tough spot,

23:06.018 --> 23:08.621
cause any problems,

23:08.621 --> 23:10.990
but Grady had ties here,
you know.

23:11.023 --> 23:12.391
Business and personal.

23:12.459 --> 23:14.393
So it's just,
it's weird to me that he

23:14.461 --> 23:16.395
would just up and disappear
like that.

23:16.463 --> 23:17.697
Shit don't make no s...

23:22.168 --> 23:24.136
You know what? Fuck it, man.

23:24.170 --> 23:25.638
End of the day,

23:25.672 --> 23:28.575
(over radio):
Grady was a clown. Right?

23:28.641 --> 23:30.510
Only a matter of time before
he turned this whole operation

23:30.543 --> 23:32.378
into a circus.

23:34.180 --> 23:38.184
Shit, me personally,
I'm happy Teddy's back.

23:38.217 --> 23:41.688
Get us back to doing business
the right way, right?

23:41.721 --> 23:43.656
See you next week, Oso.

23:43.690 --> 23:45.424
Hey, when's your birthday?

23:45.492 --> 23:47.760
You've had that jacket
for too long, man.

23:47.827 --> 23:51.864
I'm gonna get you a new jacket,
get you some fly shit.

23:51.898 --> 23:54.166
*

23:54.166 --> 23:56.769
I ain't got time
for guessing games, Chelle. Hey!

23:56.836 --> 23:58.705
-Spit it out.
-You know who is here?

23:58.738 --> 24:00.540
-And he brought a pot.
-Sorry, what?

24:00.573 --> 24:02.875
Like, a pot pot.

24:04.176 --> 24:06.345
Uh-uh, he's...
he's not back there.

24:06.345 --> 24:08.681
* Don't stop, no *

24:08.681 --> 24:11.518
* You weren't made just to
walk the streets, no, no *

24:11.518 --> 24:14.687
-(sighs)
-* I think in life... *

24:18.024 --> 24:20.192
You ready
for a little taste of home?

24:22.094 --> 24:23.696
Family recipe.

24:23.696 --> 24:25.532
I mean, it's missing
a few things, but...

24:25.532 --> 24:27.534
Buckley.

24:27.534 --> 24:29.235
This is my office.

24:29.268 --> 24:31.538
I really need you
to respect that.

24:32.539 --> 24:33.706
Okay.

24:36.442 --> 24:38.711
What's missing? Flavor?

24:38.711 --> 24:41.881
No. Pork lard instead of oil,
for starters.

24:41.881 --> 24:43.415
My daddy's recipe.

24:43.449 --> 24:44.584
That man could cook.

24:44.617 --> 24:46.418
Hey, I never told you about him?

24:46.452 --> 24:47.987
He was a giant.

24:48.054 --> 24:49.388
Played in the Negro leagues,
but...

24:49.421 --> 24:51.390
gave it up
once my sisters came along,

24:51.423 --> 24:52.825
'cause he was needed at home.

24:52.892 --> 24:55.161
Gave up a lot after that.

24:55.227 --> 24:57.396
Well, ain't that part
of growing up?

24:57.429 --> 25:00.900
-Giving up childish things?
-Oh, for some, maybe.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.902
I think that's the problem.

25:02.935 --> 25:05.071
-Giving up what makes us wild.
-(knocking)

25:05.071 --> 25:06.739
Hey.

25:06.739 --> 25:08.507
Thing one, thing two downstairs.

25:08.575 --> 25:10.743
Jerome Saint, how's it going?

25:10.743 --> 25:12.612
It's your world, nigga.

25:12.645 --> 25:15.615
How about I get Chelle
to come up here

25:15.648 --> 25:17.784
and keep you company
till I get back?

25:17.817 --> 25:19.418
That all right?

25:19.451 --> 25:21.453
Yeah.
Chelle's always a good time.

25:23.289 --> 25:25.958
Hey.

25:25.992 --> 25:27.960
I told you I needed
a little red meat.

25:27.994 --> 25:29.762
Where we at on that?

25:29.796 --> 25:32.364
It ain't a little thing
that you asking for.

25:32.431 --> 25:35.267
And right now
I got a lot of balls in the air.

25:35.301 --> 25:37.704
So I just need
a little bit more time.

25:37.770 --> 25:40.372
Okay?

25:40.439 --> 25:42.041
* No, no, no, n-n-no... *

25:42.108 --> 25:44.611
Mello stuck around
after Puff did her magic.

25:44.611 --> 25:47.213
Started throwing money
all over the place.

25:47.279 --> 25:50.216
-Throwing it?
-Like it was raining
dollar bills.

25:50.282 --> 25:52.051
I ain't never seen nobody
show out like that.

25:52.118 --> 25:54.286
I almost got my ass
on the stage.

25:54.286 --> 25:56.789
Sound like he ripe
for the pickin'.

25:56.789 --> 25:59.391
Appreciate y'all for doing that.

25:59.458 --> 26:01.160
*

26:01.193 --> 26:02.962
Come on.

26:05.197 --> 26:07.734
* N-N-N-N-No *

26:07.800 --> 26:09.168
* Just say no! *

26:16.643 --> 26:19.478
They only loyal
to the highest bidder.

26:19.511 --> 26:21.681
Said that themselves.

26:23.049 --> 26:25.251
Franklin must
be paying well, then.

26:25.317 --> 26:27.586
Fuck that shit.

26:27.654 --> 26:30.189
You really more mad than me?

26:30.222 --> 26:32.825
Putting money in they pocket.

26:32.825 --> 26:35.094
What part of the game is that?

26:35.161 --> 26:36.696
(beeping)

26:41.333 --> 26:43.335
-(train whistle blowing)
(vehicle approaching)

26:43.369 --> 26:45.171
(rodent squeaking)

27:01.520 --> 27:04.691
(car doors closing)

27:09.528 --> 27:12.031
All right, what's so urgent
it couldn't wait?

27:12.064 --> 27:14.533
After we do this next deal,

27:14.533 --> 27:16.202
Skully wants to take y'all out.

27:17.403 --> 27:19.371
Why are you telling us?

27:19.405 --> 27:21.473
Because, as I said,

27:21.540 --> 27:23.242
I like this.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.712
And you know
with him out the way,

27:25.745 --> 27:29.381
-we could do 12 a key.
-So you gonna take the throne?

27:29.381 --> 27:33.319
Tomorrow he goes to see
a psychic to talk to Tianna,

27:33.385 --> 27:35.922
for her birthday, alone.

27:35.955 --> 27:38.657
No one is feeling Skully
at this point,

27:38.725 --> 27:41.728
and no one will shed tears
over his death.

27:41.761 --> 27:44.263
-Trust me.
-Okay. So go handle that,

27:44.296 --> 27:46.833
and let us know when
you're ready to do business.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.567
Thing is, need you to handle it.

27:48.567 --> 27:51.904
Can't inherit the kingdom if
I got ties to the king's death.

27:51.938 --> 27:54.073
You set him up, we take a shot.

27:54.106 --> 27:55.908
We both in on the alley-oop.

27:55.908 --> 27:58.610
A lot of trust involved in that.

27:58.644 --> 28:00.146
We all want the same thing.

28:01.413 --> 28:04.751
Gonna need a sweetener
for that kind of heavy lifting.

28:05.752 --> 28:07.353
50K.

28:07.419 --> 28:08.788
Done.

28:08.821 --> 28:10.790
You should've said a hundred.

28:10.823 --> 28:12.258
A hundred, then.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.625
Since you insist.

28:14.626 --> 28:16.963
He'll be there tomorrow at noon.

28:18.597 --> 28:20.266
Reach out when it's done.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.803
(train rattling on tracks)

28:36.448 --> 28:37.984
(engine turns off)

28:40.452 --> 28:42.188
LOUIE:
Yeah, that's it.

28:43.622 --> 28:46.793
What if she know?

28:46.793 --> 28:48.795
What if who knows what?

28:50.329 --> 28:53.065
She's supposed to be psychic,
right?

28:53.132 --> 28:54.133
Yeah.

28:54.166 --> 28:55.467
(opens door)

28:55.501 --> 28:57.536
(dog barking in distance)

29:01.473 --> 29:03.475
-Oui?
-Bonjour.

29:06.212 --> 29:07.179
Oui?

29:07.213 --> 29:08.480
(speaks Creole)

29:08.480 --> 29:10.349
What bring you to cross

29:10.382 --> 29:11.818
Mama Mambo's threshold...
(speaks Creole)

29:11.818 --> 29:14.420
(Creole accent):
Saw the sign out front.

29:14.486 --> 29:16.355
Having trouble with some people.

29:16.388 --> 29:18.657
Need some work done.

29:18.690 --> 29:20.860
(speaking Creole)

29:24.230 --> 29:25.832
Today no good.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.666
-You come back tomorrow.
I'll get you straight.
-No, no.

29:27.666 --> 29:29.501
Today...

29:29.535 --> 29:31.871
work best for me.

29:38.677 --> 29:40.179
(engine shuts off)

29:43.883 --> 29:46.118
When I said I wanted to invest
in property,

29:46.185 --> 29:49.188
like you and ole girl,
this ain't what I meant.

29:49.188 --> 29:51.557
It's all good.

29:51.590 --> 29:53.025
We just gonna look around.

29:54.226 --> 29:55.727
DALLAS:
For... ghosts?

29:56.863 --> 29:58.230
Syringes?

29:58.264 --> 30:00.532
You go on ahead.
I'll watch the car.

30:00.566 --> 30:02.701
You scared?

30:02.701 --> 30:05.304
Of doing white people shit like
going up in abandoned buildings

30:05.371 --> 30:08.074
for a look around,
mm-hmm, sure am.

30:08.107 --> 30:09.909
See something you don't like,
shoot it. Come on.

30:33.933 --> 30:35.734
*

31:00.759 --> 31:02.794
*

31:13.605 --> 31:15.607
Motherfucker.

31:16.943 --> 31:19.778
(dog barking in distance)

31:38.830 --> 31:42.301
(speaks Creole)

31:42.334 --> 31:45.371
-We good?
-Come and rest your heart
inside.

31:58.050 --> 32:01.753
I knew you motherfuckers
was possums.

32:01.820 --> 32:03.189
I knew it!

32:05.024 --> 32:06.758
This ain't what I wanted
to go down.

32:06.825 --> 32:08.995
I really am sorry, Skully.

32:11.163 --> 32:13.499
Mello want a shot
running things.

32:13.499 --> 32:15.367
Came to us.

32:15.401 --> 32:19.338
Told us about how you plan on
sticking us up at the next drop.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.173
Afraid that don't work for us.

32:32.518 --> 32:34.853
You good, baby?

32:35.754 --> 32:37.523
I'm good.

32:50.369 --> 32:51.703
It's handled.

32:51.703 --> 32:55.041
You sure?
Streets, police scanners,

32:55.041 --> 32:57.976
news, all mighty quiet.

32:58.044 --> 33:00.046
Ain't amateur hour
over here, nigga.

33:04.250 --> 33:07.653
I feel you, but I'm gonna need
a little more than words

33:07.719 --> 33:09.755
to feel comfortable.

33:22.734 --> 33:26.572
Keys to the fucking kingdom.

33:26.605 --> 33:29.275
It's gonna take a few weeks
for me to seize the throne.

33:29.308 --> 33:31.943
Got to play the part, you know?

33:31.977 --> 33:34.113
Pour some out
for the dead homie.

33:44.590 --> 33:46.458
-(hammers cocking)
-Now, come on, Skully.

33:46.492 --> 33:47.859
You know me.

33:47.926 --> 33:49.861
You already know she came to me

33:49.928 --> 33:51.630
with this whole plan...

33:51.663 --> 33:53.099
(grunts)

33:53.132 --> 33:55.834
(grunting, choking)

33:58.604 --> 34:00.606
Rest your spirit.

34:00.606 --> 34:02.141
(muffled grunting)

34:02.174 --> 34:04.143
(bones crack)

34:05.444 --> 34:07.646
(panting)

34:10.482 --> 34:12.551
Through God...

34:12.618 --> 34:15.387
we shall do valiantly,

34:15.454 --> 34:17.956
for it is he...

34:17.989 --> 34:21.193
that shall trample down
our enemies.

34:23.995 --> 34:27.399
You, too, huh?
You unfunny-ass nigga.

34:27.466 --> 34:30.569
You know what? Take these niggas
back to the white room.

34:30.636 --> 34:32.538
I want to test it out.

34:43.682 --> 34:46.518
You know it's a cold game we in.

34:46.552 --> 34:49.821
Pain had me doubt your loyalty.

34:49.855 --> 34:52.191
Why didn't you take a shot?

34:52.224 --> 34:56.027
It is a cold game we in, Skully,
but somehow...

34:56.061 --> 34:59.064
we found warmth
in that hospital.

35:11.377 --> 35:13.845
And you right...

35:13.845 --> 35:16.282
we owe you honor.

35:16.348 --> 35:19.551
You know,
we are our own persons.

35:19.585 --> 35:22.388
Ain't nobody controlling us.

35:22.421 --> 35:24.190
(breath trembles)

35:24.223 --> 35:28.427
You let my angel be a reminder
to you of that.

35:36.602 --> 35:37.903
Oh.

35:37.936 --> 35:39.705
You were right.

35:41.240 --> 35:43.642
We going back
to the original price.

35:43.709 --> 35:45.711
What about the money?

35:45.744 --> 35:47.879
SKULLY:
Keep it.

35:47.879 --> 35:49.881
I don't want that juju shit
on me.

36:09.401 --> 36:10.902
(sighs)

36:17.909 --> 36:19.077
(pops)

36:20.412 --> 36:22.781
Where you going? Come on.

36:22.814 --> 36:25.917
(laughs) We got to celebrate
getting that proposal in, honey.

36:25.917 --> 36:27.953
Mm-hmm.

36:27.986 --> 36:29.588
* We got them files in... *

36:29.621 --> 36:31.923
You want to dance with me.

36:31.957 --> 36:33.925
* They wanted thousands *

36:33.959 --> 36:36.127
* Oh, back, back, back, back *

36:36.161 --> 36:38.630
* We gave them millions. *

36:41.767 --> 36:44.202
Okay. All right.

36:44.270 --> 36:47.205
-Who do I need to beat up?
-(chuckles)

36:47.273 --> 36:50.141
I'm a pregnant lawyer,
pretty much un-convictable.

36:50.175 --> 36:52.278
And we both know I got hands.

36:52.311 --> 36:54.646
(both laugh)

36:54.680 --> 36:56.615
Come on, talk to me.

36:56.648 --> 36:58.450
Is this because of Teddy?

36:58.450 --> 37:00.986
Nah, nah. It's just...

37:01.019 --> 37:03.121
just a lot of tension, you know.

37:03.121 --> 37:04.623
A lot going on.

37:05.624 --> 37:08.627
Do you wanna...

37:08.627 --> 37:10.962
Uh, I'm not in the mood
to meditate or cleanse,

37:10.996 --> 37:12.998
anything like that, V.

37:13.031 --> 37:14.633
...have sex?

37:14.666 --> 37:16.635
You release some dopamine
that way.

37:16.635 --> 37:18.304
(both laugh softly)

37:21.340 --> 37:23.309
-Rain check.
-Hmm.

37:23.342 --> 37:25.243
-But I appreciate you.
-(chuckles)

37:25.311 --> 37:26.812
-And everything you do.
-Mm-hmm.

37:28.046 --> 37:31.750
-Excuse me, Franklin.
-Wanda?

37:31.817 --> 37:34.320
Hey, uh, sorry
to mess up your happy hour.

37:34.353 --> 37:37.323
Franklin, you think
we could talk for a second?

37:40.826 --> 37:43.495
-What's up?
-Okay.

37:43.529 --> 37:46.832
So, I was eavesdropping
at the house the other night--

37:46.865 --> 37:48.934
not even gonna lie, my bad--

37:49.000 --> 37:51.036
but I thought
I heard you say something

37:51.069 --> 37:53.171
about Betty having
water on her knees?

37:53.171 --> 37:55.674
Can't walk up all the stairs
to collect the rent?

37:55.674 --> 37:57.208
Well, I'm not sure if you know,
but...

37:57.242 --> 37:59.545
I used to run track at Jordan.

37:59.578 --> 38:02.448
-I didn't know that.
-Okay, well, I, um, grew up

38:02.514 --> 38:04.716
doing construction work
with my daddy, too.

38:04.750 --> 38:07.519
So handiwork?
Pssh, ain't no thing.

38:07.553 --> 38:09.355
I mean, shit,
you could ask Leon.

38:09.355 --> 38:11.523
One time I had to fix
his mama's dryer, right?

38:11.523 --> 38:13.959
No wrench, all hands.

38:14.025 --> 38:15.894
Last time
I went in the projects,

38:15.927 --> 38:18.364
dryer still blowing.

38:18.364 --> 38:20.599
You asking for a job, Wanda?

38:21.900 --> 38:24.970
Look, I need something else
in my life.

38:25.036 --> 38:27.473
Okay?
This-this scraping-by shit...

38:27.539 --> 38:30.075
I don't know how much longer
I can do it.

38:30.108 --> 38:31.910
(sighs):
Uh...

38:33.111 --> 38:35.213
-All right, all right.
-Okay. Thank you so much.

38:35.246 --> 38:36.415
Ooh, thank you, thank you,
Franklin.

38:36.448 --> 38:37.883
Look, take as much time
as you need.

38:37.916 --> 38:39.217
But not too much time.

38:39.250 --> 38:40.719
-Bitches is broke.
-(chuckles)

38:40.752 --> 38:42.754
-Thank you.
-All right.

39:01.607 --> 39:03.609
FRANKLIN:
How'd it go in Inglewood?

39:03.642 --> 39:05.977
Settled everything
without firing a shot.

39:07.245 --> 39:09.314
Long as it's settled.

39:12.484 --> 39:14.586
You talk to Teddy?

39:14.620 --> 39:16.254
(sighs)
Yeah.

39:18.123 --> 39:19.958
-And?
-You know, honestly,

39:19.991 --> 39:21.593
I'm tired of talking
about this shit, Louie.

39:22.794 --> 39:24.362
We about to start
this shit up again?

39:24.430 --> 39:26.197
Yes, we are.

39:26.264 --> 39:28.366
'Cause they got no idea
the shit we going through

39:28.434 --> 39:30.368
out in the street, and you
won't let me talk to him,

39:30.436 --> 39:32.938
so pardon me if I want to know
what the fuck he said.

39:32.971 --> 39:34.606
-You want to know what he said?
-Yeah.

39:34.606 --> 39:36.107
He said the prices
ain't changing,

39:36.107 --> 39:37.709
'cause the prices
ain't the problem.

39:37.776 --> 39:38.777
-Know what is?
-LOUIE: Hmm?

39:38.777 --> 39:39.811
Y'all two.

39:41.112 --> 39:43.381
Breaking away from me.

39:43.449 --> 39:45.817
-Going out on your own.
-LOUIE: I see.

39:45.851 --> 39:47.385
So you just gonna bend over

39:47.453 --> 39:49.788
-and do whatever he say?
-FRANKLIN (chuckles): No.

39:49.788 --> 39:51.457
But this time he's right.

39:51.457 --> 39:53.224
Look, I gave y'all a chance.

39:53.291 --> 39:55.126
Did this shit
for as long as I could.

39:55.126 --> 39:57.796
But this little experiment,
it's not working.

39:57.796 --> 39:59.998
I'm happy to split the profits
with you all fifty-fifty.

40:01.299 --> 40:02.333
But you got to come home.

40:02.367 --> 40:03.969
Get this operation
under one roof.

40:04.002 --> 40:05.804
No, we ain't doing that.

40:05.804 --> 40:08.474
-Why? Why not?
-Because I don't want
to put my life--

40:08.474 --> 40:11.743
our life-- at risk
for your bullshit-ass decisions.

40:11.810 --> 40:13.979
Is that it?

40:14.012 --> 40:16.582
Or is that you're so sure
that you're so much smarter

40:16.648 --> 40:18.083
than everybody else?

40:18.149 --> 40:19.485
Getting tired of this.

40:19.518 --> 40:20.919
Lions fighting over sheep.

40:20.986 --> 40:23.421
-This between me and him.
-Oh, yeah?

40:23.489 --> 40:25.423
So why don't you
handle it, then?

40:25.491 --> 40:28.026
Boom! That's right.

40:28.059 --> 40:30.361
'Cause I know breaking away
wasn't Jerome's idea.

40:30.395 --> 40:33.499
And I let it go,
'cause you'd been shot,

40:33.532 --> 40:34.833
been through
some traumatic shit.

40:34.833 --> 40:36.702
Hey, you let it go?

40:36.735 --> 40:39.004
Yeah, that's right. For her.

40:39.037 --> 40:41.840
Don't talk
out your goddamn neck, boy.

40:41.840 --> 40:44.510
(laughs) Well,
then maybe you can enlighten me,

40:44.543 --> 40:47.212
Unc, on what the fuck she wants!

40:47.245 --> 40:50.448
Nah. Why don't you ask her
yourself, then?

40:50.516 --> 40:53.218
What would you like,
Queen Louie?

40:53.251 --> 40:54.853
What's gonna make you happy?

40:54.886 --> 40:56.354
'Cause nothing seems to do it
for you.

40:56.354 --> 41:00.225
How about not being
under anybody's thumb, nephew.

41:00.258 --> 41:02.460
FRANKLIN:
Well, I hate to break it to you,

41:02.528 --> 41:04.863
but everybody's got to answer
to somebody. And me?

41:04.863 --> 41:07.465
I answer to the man who may have
disappeared my fucking father,

41:07.533 --> 41:09.635
and who will do the same to us
if we don't move this product.

41:09.701 --> 41:13.038
Now, I don't know about y'all
two, but I'd like to stay alive

41:13.071 --> 41:15.240
long enough
to enjoy what I've made.

41:15.273 --> 41:17.208
So from here on out, I don't
want to hear anything else

41:17.208 --> 41:18.476
about kilos or prices.

41:18.544 --> 41:20.045
Y'all want to go out
on your own? Fine!

41:20.078 --> 41:22.648
But do not for one second
fuck around

41:22.714 --> 41:24.482
with what I got to do
to get mine,

41:24.550 --> 41:27.218
'cause I promise you there is
nothing I'm not prepared to do.

41:31.422 --> 41:32.891

Media Access Group at WGBH

43:30.876 --> 43:33.511
FRANKLIN: There's a lot
at stake these days.

43:33.578 --> 43:36.514
And I am under
a lot of pressure.

43:36.581 --> 43:38.583
We're glad you got
your own dreams,

43:39.350 --> 43:41.920
but they're not ours.

43:41.953 --> 43:44.522
-(elevator bell dings)
-This empire,
it's gonna crumble.

43:46.257 --> 43:47.592
-(brakes squeal)
-(grunts)

43:50.228 --> 43:52.097
FRANKLIN: I'm gonna do
whatever it takes.

44:00.371 --> 44:01.740
FRANKIE: Get in shape.

44:01.807 --> 44:03.942
-You might have a chance
of living past 60.
-Yes!

44:06.444 --> 44:08.046
(gasps)

44:08.113 --> 44:09.447
-She's so pretty.
-Who's pretty?

44:09.480 --> 44:10.916
Mom, this conversation
is private.

44:10.982 --> 44:14.485
They're all older than me now.
You wouldn't believe it.

44:14.585 --> 44:16.988
Life is a series
of befores and afters.

44:19.124 --> 44:20.391
Okay.

44:20.458 --> 44:23.628
I'm jealous of everybody
who gets to meet you
down the road.

All new, Mondays

44:37.909 --> 44:39.510
Here for the do, is it?

44:39.610 --> 44:41.747
I don't--
I don't know what you're saying.

44:47.018 --> 44:48.653
Do I gotta get naked for this?

44:48.686 --> 44:51.857
Nudity isn't required, I think.

44:51.957 --> 44:53.992
[scoffs] I don't know. Europe.

WOMAN:
We are not safe here.

45:06.872 --> 45:08.339
We don't really
live in this world.

45:09.140 --> 45:10.041
We feed off of it.

45:11.176 --> 45:13.478
Aliens. Mother of God.

45:14.479 --> 45:16.314
How have you
not gone insane?

45:17.783 --> 45:19.650
Once you sell your soul,
it's gone.

45:20.151 --> 45:21.319
MAN: Boo!

45:21.352 --> 45:22.320
It's breaking
all the rules.

45:22.387 --> 45:23.488
(screams)

45:23.521 --> 45:24.790
And I'm here for that.
