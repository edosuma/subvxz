13:45.797 --> 13:48.198
are the Harvest Girls Elijah
murdered in cold blood!

13:50.398 --> 13:53.036
- Kol!
- Leave him.

13:54.272 --> 13:55.831
We've got work to do.

14:06.685 --> 14:09.319
[music, laughter]

14:09.321 --> 14:11.421
[indistinct voices]

14:18.029 --> 14:19.863
[laughter]

14:19.865 --> 14:22.002
You liar. You swine.

14:22.005 --> 14:24.100
Well, it certainly took me a long time,

14:24.102 --> 14:26.102
but I finally found it.

14:26.104 --> 14:28.271
No, no, no, that Bordeaux was a gift

14:28.273 --> 14:29.741
from the Duke of Burgundy.

14:29.744 --> 14:30.930
Yes, a very lovely gift,

14:30.933 --> 14:32.696
intended to be shared
on a special occasion.

14:32.699 --> 14:34.410
KOL: Perhaps, say, a family dinner

14:34.413 --> 14:35.712
that did not end

14:35.714 --> 14:37.480
with one of us getting daggered.

14:37.482 --> 14:39.108
ELIJAH: Indeed, indeed.

14:39.111 --> 14:40.717
It's more than worth the indulgence.

14:40.719 --> 14:42.318
Yes, to my beloved siblings.

14:42.320 --> 14:44.264
Together beneath one roof

14:44.267 --> 14:46.022
for the first time in centuries,

14:46.024 --> 14:47.790
with neither an argument

14:47.792 --> 14:49.359
nor a grievance to be found.

14:49.361 --> 14:50.821
- MEN: Cheers.
- Cheers to that.

14:50.824 --> 14:52.595
[laughter]

14:52.597 --> 14:54.063
[voice echoing]: Elijah.

14:54.065 --> 14:56.222
Oh, that is lovely.

14:56.234 --> 14:57.519
It's me.

14:57.522 --> 14:59.068
KLAUS: As was the Duke of Burgundy.

14:59.070 --> 15:02.305
[indistinct conversation]

15:02.307 --> 15:04.073
Elijah.

15:15.053 --> 15:16.553
[panting]

15:17.786 --> 15:19.168
Freya, what's wrong?

15:19.171 --> 15:20.990
I thought I found him,
but he just vanished

15:20.992 --> 15:22.125
right in front of me.

15:23.495 --> 15:25.728
That's not our only problem.

15:25.730 --> 15:26.896
I can't search Elijah's mind

15:26.898 --> 15:28.898
and sustain a spell at the same time.

15:30.850 --> 15:32.368
What if you sent me in?

15:32.370 --> 15:34.070
That would require more power.

15:34.072 --> 15:35.939
You stay here and anchor the spell.

15:35.941 --> 15:37.507
He'll respond to me.

15:37.509 --> 15:39.742
Send me in, Freya, I can find him.

15:39.744 --> 15:41.811
Nobody's closer to Elijah than I am.

15:41.813 --> 15:45.748
To place you into the pendant,

15:45.750 --> 15:48.351
I would need to channel another witch.

15:48.353 --> 15:49.752
A powerful one.

15:49.754 --> 15:51.688
Born of my family's bloodline.

15:51.690 --> 15:54.157
Hope. No. She's too young for this.

15:54.159 --> 15:56.159
She's young, but she's strong.

15:56.161 --> 15:57.940
Stronger than I was at her age.

15:57.943 --> 16:02.354
Hayley, I would never
hurt my niece, ever.

16:12.410 --> 16:14.165
Marcel?

16:22.087 --> 16:23.319
- [gasps]
- Oh!

16:27.025 --> 16:29.659
That's a peculiar place for a nap.

16:29.661 --> 16:32.595
It wasn't like I had a choice.

16:32.597 --> 16:34.230
You're fighting a
one-man war, Marcellus.

16:34.232 --> 16:36.199
Doesn't seem to be going very well.

16:36.201 --> 16:37.600
Perhaps next time

16:37.602 --> 16:40.236
you'll honor our alliance
and inform me of your tactics.

16:40.238 --> 16:43.373
Look, I don't need to
inform anyone of my tactics,

16:43.375 --> 16:44.263
especially you.

16:44.266 --> 16:45.808
Well, if they're this ill-conceived,

16:45.810 --> 16:47.044
perhaps you could do with my help.

16:47.046 --> 16:48.645
Well, I love it when you two bicker.

16:48.648 --> 16:50.213
We did come here for a reason.

16:50.215 --> 16:51.648
Ah, yes.

16:51.651 --> 16:53.451
The Hollow's weapon.

16:54.986 --> 16:57.687
The magically crafted source
of all our current misery.

16:57.689 --> 17:00.323
Magic... I need that.

17:00.325 --> 17:02.125
- Give it to me.
- Have you lost your mind,

17:02.127 --> 17:03.803
or has the Hollow
stolen it from you again?

17:03.805 --> 17:05.261
Children, please use your words.

17:05.262 --> 17:07.563
- You're out of order.
- Those thorns are made with my blood

17:07.565 --> 17:08.742
and the Hollow's magic,

17:08.746 --> 17:11.401
- so give it to me!
- Stop it, both of you!

17:11.403 --> 17:12.535
Elijah is gone,

17:12.537 --> 17:13.603
we are under attack,

17:13.605 --> 17:15.471
and we cannot defeat
our enemy with you two

17:15.473 --> 17:17.173
- at each other's throat.
- She's right.

17:17.175 --> 17:19.474
Look, I'm not gonna give
the thorns to the Hollow.

17:19.477 --> 17:21.010
I want them for something else,

17:21.012 --> 17:22.377
and I don't need them to hurt you.

17:22.380 --> 17:23.746
So unless you want me to prove that...

17:23.748 --> 17:25.381
Marcel, please.

17:27.652 --> 17:29.885
Do you really want to
fight the both of us,

17:29.888 --> 17:32.088
after everything that we have endured?

17:32.891 --> 17:34.190
We need your help.

17:36.261 --> 17:38.027
We need to destroy all of the thorns

17:38.029 --> 17:39.762
so we can end this once and for all.

17:39.764 --> 17:41.274
What, do you mean there's more?

17:41.277 --> 17:43.700
Yes, we cleared the Quarter, but
there's still one in Gentilly.

17:43.702 --> 17:44.867
So if we go together...

17:47.172 --> 17:48.705
Nice job, sister.

17:48.707 --> 17:52.375
Perhaps next time less
carrot, more stick.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.652
You don't have to do
this if you don't want to.

18:08.654 --> 18:10.520
It's okay. I'm not afraid.

18:10.522 --> 18:12.689
Ready?

18:16.860 --> 18:19.060
So he's just in there somewhere,

18:19.063 --> 18:20.697
clinging to broken memories?

18:20.699 --> 18:22.165
The core of his being has retreated

18:22.167 --> 18:23.433
deep into his subconscious,

18:23.435 --> 18:25.669
but, yes, he's still in there.

18:25.671 --> 18:28.005
And I just search until I find him?

18:28.007 --> 18:29.940
You don't have time.
There are too many memories

18:29.942 --> 18:31.508
for you to randomly search.

18:31.510 --> 18:34.411
You have to think, where
would Elijah find refuge?

18:34.413 --> 18:36.179
It has to be somewhere that represents

18:36.181 --> 18:38.048
the fundamental basis of who he is.

18:38.050 --> 18:39.750
Hopefully, that's a good place.

18:39.752 --> 18:42.619
When you find it, draw
him out and wake him up.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.555
But be careful, his mind is unstable.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.063
Mom?

18:54.201 --> 18:56.600
Be careful.

18:58.491 --> 19:00.291
I'll be right back, sweetie.

19:06.679 --> 19:10.814
FREYA: <i>Tillate ulaz. Tillate ulaz.</i>

19:10.816 --> 19:15.686
BOTH: <i>Tillate ulaz. Tillate ulaz.</i>

19:15.688 --> 19:20.324
<i>Tillate ulaz. Tillate ulaz.</i>

19:22.294 --> 19:24.528
[indistinct whispers]

19:36.043 --> 19:38.208
Come on, Elijah, where are you?

19:47.553 --> 19:49.219
[man screaming]

19:51.590 --> 19:53.123
[screaming continues]

20:08.439 --> 20:10.973
[man grunting]

20:10.976 --> 20:12.843
[metal clangs]

20:15.547 --> 20:18.715
[flesh ripping, pained cries]

20:21.520 --> 20:23.120
[growling]

20:23.122 --> 20:24.388
[pained screaming]

20:33.198 --> 20:35.399
[panting]

20:48.814 --> 20:50.213
Your hair.

20:50.215 --> 20:51.381
I changed it.

20:51.383 --> 20:53.083
ELIJAH: Yeah.

20:54.777 --> 20:57.178
I missed you.

21:02.061 --> 21:04.050
Let me go get dressed.

21:11.070 --> 21:13.236
[sighs]

21:14.940 --> 21:16.756
HAYLEY: Elijah.

21:19.478 --> 21:22.145
It's me.

21:24.183 --> 21:26.650
I know you're here.

21:28.854 --> 21:30.320
Look at me.

21:48.407 --> 21:50.240
REBEKAH: All right, I've had enough

21:50.242 --> 21:51.708
of your condescending cold shoulder.

21:51.710 --> 21:53.243
- Talk to me.
- KLAUS: And do what?

21:53.245 --> 21:54.711
State the obvious? That
your feelings for Marcel

21:54.713 --> 21:56.179
have left you compromised.

21:56.181 --> 21:57.681
Even now when your
family needs you the most,

21:57.683 --> 21:59.716
he's got you wrapped
around his little finger.

21:59.718 --> 22:01.162
You're filled with grief
and you're lashing out,

22:01.164 --> 22:02.252
but you know what?

22:02.254 --> 22:04.688
He's my brother, too,
and I am just as hurt

22:04.690 --> 22:06.423
and just as scared without him here.

22:06.425 --> 22:09.059
Well, then you should go.
I'll find the thorns myself,

22:09.061 --> 22:11.027
butcher my way through this
entire city if that's what

22:11.029 --> 22:12.863
it takes, and if it turns
out Marcel has taken them,

22:12.865 --> 22:14.397
I'll deal with him as well.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.191
Oh, lovely, you're
sounding like your old self.

22:16.193 --> 22:18.122
Well, someone has to
protect this family.

22:18.125 --> 22:20.325
And there it is.

22:20.328 --> 22:22.305
The excuse that you always use.

22:22.307 --> 22:25.475
You know, if you're so
determined to be this way,

22:25.477 --> 22:27.277
then everything that
Elijah has done for you,

22:27.279 --> 22:31.047
including his death,
will be for nothing.

22:49.568 --> 22:51.735
[man screaming]

22:55.807 --> 22:58.341
Must be in here.

23:03.182 --> 23:05.348
[man screaming]

23:18.238 --> 23:20.438
[door closes]

23:42.421 --> 23:44.621
[man crying softly]

23:46.391 --> 23:48.525
Elijah?

23:51.997 --> 23:54.731
I'm here to help you.

24:13.418 --> 24:14.985
[gasps]

24:15.754 --> 24:18.088
Elijah.

24:21.627 --> 24:23.279
Hey.

24:23.282 --> 24:26.545
Elijah, wake up.

24:26.548 --> 24:27.897
It's me.

24:27.899 --> 24:29.566
Elijah!

24:29.568 --> 24:31.811
Stop! Stop!

24:38.307 --> 24:41.008
I appreciate you meeting with me.

24:42.545 --> 24:44.344
And I'd like to make
it worth your while.

24:46.849 --> 24:48.115
Dark Objects.

24:48.117 --> 24:51.663
The most powerful
trinkets in New Orleans.

24:51.666 --> 24:53.446
And this...

24:53.449 --> 24:55.402
this is not even half of what I have.

24:55.405 --> 24:58.272
We're Harvest Girls. We
know what Dark Objects are.

24:58.274 --> 25:00.741
What do you want for them?

25:03.212 --> 25:06.380
I want to talk to Davina Claire.

25:06.979 --> 25:08.379
Now, I know what you're thinking.

25:08.382 --> 25:09.381
Why help a Mikaelson?

25:09.384 --> 25:10.850
Your brother murdered us.

25:10.853 --> 25:12.453
I am not my brother.

25:13.742 --> 25:16.310
I have been a friend to
witches for centuries.

25:16.312 --> 25:20.013
I... I even taught you lot
how to make these things.

25:21.617 --> 25:24.585
There's no reason we
can't go back to old times.

25:24.587 --> 25:27.321
We know better than to trust vampires.

25:27.323 --> 25:30.557
The Hollow is the real enemy here,

25:30.559 --> 25:32.392
not me.

25:32.394 --> 25:34.761
Now, like it or not, we
are all in this together.

25:35.446 --> 25:38.981
But trust me when I say I
make a better friend than foe.

25:41.470 --> 25:44.371
Take the Objects. Just
please let me talk to her.

25:44.373 --> 25:48.208
You Mikaelsons come around
asking for favors, threatening,

25:48.210 --> 25:49.441
manipulating.

25:49.444 --> 25:52.713
That's why we're gonna make sure
you never see Davina Claire again.

25:52.715 --> 25:54.515
Let me talk to her now!

25:54.517 --> 25:56.183
[shouting]

25:57.258 --> 25:59.620
- [grunts]
- [bones snap]

26:13.235 --> 26:16.069
MARCEL: You guys put up a good fight.

26:16.071 --> 26:17.971
I respect that.

26:17.973 --> 26:21.775
Still, at the end of
the day, too little...

26:21.777 --> 26:23.977
too late.

26:31.253 --> 26:33.620
And that is the last one.

26:33.622 --> 26:36.456
I suppose I should say
thank you for your hard work.

26:36.458 --> 26:38.592
Don't make me fight you, Rebekah.

26:38.594 --> 26:41.061
If you want this, you'll have to.

26:41.864 --> 26:44.965
- Let it go.
- You know I won't.

26:46.302 --> 26:47.367
If you desire a weapon

26:47.369 --> 26:49.303
that can kill us, then you're a threat.

26:49.305 --> 26:50.504
That's just your paranoia, all right?

26:50.506 --> 26:52.239
Not everything is a plot against you.

26:52.241 --> 26:53.525
Then why seek the thorns at all?

26:53.528 --> 26:54.741
Because there's more at risk

26:54.743 --> 26:55.809
than just your family, all right?

26:55.811 --> 26:57.244
The magic in those thorns

26:57.246 --> 26:58.845
can save someone that I care about.

26:58.847 --> 27:00.414
All right? You can burn the other ones,

27:00.416 --> 27:03.283
just give me that one!

27:03.285 --> 27:05.319
What's her name?

27:25.741 --> 27:28.275
Her name is Sofya.

27:33.082 --> 27:37.284
There was a time when you'd have
gone to these lengths for me.

27:37.286 --> 27:38.585
KLAUS: Rebekah.

27:38.587 --> 27:39.953
Come on, Nik.

27:41.557 --> 27:42.923
I know that look well.

27:42.925 --> 27:45.993
He's fighting for love.

27:52.404 --> 27:55.197
When you're done saving
your precious Sofya...

27:55.200 --> 27:58.639
Yeah, of course. I'll burn it myself.

28:08.250 --> 28:10.350
FREYA and HOPE [chanting]: Tillate ulaz.

28:10.352 --> 28:11.985
<i>Tillate ulaz.</i>

28:11.987 --> 28:15.222

29:06.442 --> 29:08.608
Elijah.

29:10.245 --> 29:12.112
Please. Stop!

29:12.114 --> 29:15.082
BOTH: <i>Tillate ulaz. Tillate ulaz.</i>
