WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:04.572
KARA: When I was a child,
my planet Krypton was dying.

00:04.605 --> 00:08.309
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.244
But my pod got
knocked off-course

00:10.278 --> 00:11.712
and by the time I got here,

00:11.745 --> 00:15.616
my cousin
had already grown up
and become Superman.

00:16.817 --> 00:18.486
I hid who I really was

00:18.519 --> 00:22.623
until one day
when an accident forced me
to reveal myself to the world.

00:22.656 --> 00:26.094
To most people, I'm a reporter
at CatCo Worldwide Media.

00:26.127 --> 00:29.530
But in secret, I work with my
adoptive sister for the DEO

00:29.563 --> 00:31.532
to protect my city
from alien life

00:31.565 --> 00:34.168
and anyone else
that means to cause it harm.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.472
I am Supergirl.

00:38.506 --> 00:40.474
KARA:
Previously on Supergirl...

00:40.508 --> 00:41.342
You were a palace guard?

00:41.375 --> 00:43.411
For the great royal family
of Daxam.

00:43.444 --> 00:46.680
They were the worst
and their son,
the worst of the worst.

00:46.714 --> 00:49.683
Any chance there was
a response from that signal
I sent to Daxam?

00:49.717 --> 00:51.519
I'm sorry, but no.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.587
NAVIGATOR: Your Highnesses.
We've reached
our coordinates.

00:53.621 --> 00:55.523
Finally.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.191
We've arrived.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.230
Wow!

01:02.263 --> 01:04.632
We're six seasons in
and winter still hasn't come!

01:04.665 --> 01:06.167
(CHUCKLES)

01:06.200 --> 01:08.602
You know, since you
got fired from CatCo,

01:08.636 --> 01:10.638
your queue has gone
down exponentially.

01:10.671 --> 01:13.607
Yes, well, I am fully
embracing my funemployment.

01:13.641 --> 01:15.176
Funemployment.

01:15.209 --> 01:17.211
What's next?

01:17.245 --> 01:19.647
Oh, how about, uh...
How about one of those movies
where everybody just...

01:19.680 --> 01:22.350
Just breaks into song
out of nowhere?

01:22.383 --> 01:23.551
You mean a musical?

01:23.584 --> 01:25.253
Yes! Yes.

01:25.286 --> 01:26.854
Are you serious right now?

01:26.887 --> 01:28.889
-Dead serious.
-You are opening
the floodgates my friend.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.625
We have to watch Funny Face!

01:31.659 --> 01:34.862
It's Fred Astaire,
Audrey Hepburn,
being adorable.

01:34.895 --> 01:37.598
The most romantic movie ever!

01:39.900 --> 01:41.402
(LAUGHING) What?

01:42.170 --> 01:43.771
That face. That smile.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.373
I'm just happy.

01:45.406 --> 01:48.409
-Yeah?
-Yeah, like that...

01:48.442 --> 01:51.912
Dopey grin, butterflies
in my stomach happy.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.348
-Mmm-hmm.
-Is that cheesy?

01:54.382 --> 01:58.419
It's like, it's like
a rom-com on steroids cheesy.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.423
But I'm happy you're happy.

02:07.928 --> 02:10.231
What's the...

02:10.264 --> 02:12.600
DISTORTED VOICE:
To his captors...

02:12.633 --> 02:16.170
We demand you turn
over Mon-El of Daxam.

02:16.904 --> 02:19.873
We know where he is harbored.

02:19.907 --> 02:22.910
If you do not relinquish
him by dawn,

02:22.943 --> 02:24.612
we will take him with force.

02:31.219 --> 02:34.455
When the transmission came
through, an unknown spacecraft
entered the lower atmosphere

02:34.488 --> 02:35.956
right above National City.

02:35.989 --> 02:39.193
What do a bunch of space
invaders want with a
guard from Daxam?

02:40.828 --> 02:43.464
Does any of this
look familiar to you?

02:43.497 --> 02:44.865
I've never seen a cruiser
like that in my life.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.867
We're searching for the origin
of the ship

02:46.900 --> 02:49.437
to see if that gives us
any indication as to who
our new friends may be,

02:49.470 --> 02:52.506
but so far, no match.
Agent Schott!

02:52.540 --> 02:54.375
Where the hell is he?

02:57.010 --> 02:59.347
(LAUGHING)

02:59.380 --> 03:01.215
Whoa!
And there we are.

03:01.249 --> 03:03.251
Hey. Oh...

03:03.284 --> 03:05.219
-Ah.
-We're here.

03:05.253 --> 03:06.754
Oh, we're here.

03:06.787 --> 03:10.358
We are at the
National City Art Gallery
side entrance.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.926
Wow, you know that
people generally
go in the front door,

03:12.960 --> 03:15.229
and when they do,
it's kinda during the day.

03:15.263 --> 03:16.897
(WHISPERS)
So, let's come back
in the morning!

03:16.930 --> 03:19.700
But they won't let us do what
I want to do tomorrow morning.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.435
WINN: Uh-huh.

03:21.469 --> 03:23.537
Whoa!
What are you...

03:23.571 --> 03:25.306
Woman, you are a she-hulk.

03:25.339 --> 03:26.807
Where's your sense
of adventure?

03:26.840 --> 03:28.742
(SIGHS)

03:28.776 --> 03:30.911
Okay, Winn, I'm not gonna
make you do anything
you don't wanna do.

03:30.944 --> 03:34.615
So if you don't want to break
in and have divine
museum sex, then...

03:34.648 --> 03:36.016
Okay, okay.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.986
Oh, wow, this is a little
complicated so it just
might take me...

03:39.019 --> 03:40.921
-Oh, hey.
-(DEVICE BEEPS)

03:40.954 --> 03:42.590
Okay.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.226
The clock is ticking.

03:46.260 --> 03:49.463
Well, I think it's time
we give the noobs
the old Supergirl welcome.

03:49.497 --> 03:50.931
I'm coming with you.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.266
(LAUGHING) No way.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.667
Kara, you were...

03:53.701 --> 03:55.769
All we know about these people
is that they want you,

03:55.803 --> 03:57.738
so you should be
the last person to go.

03:57.771 --> 04:00.608
That... Okay.
Well then, be careful.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.276
Always am.

04:02.310 --> 04:03.711
Respectfully disagree.

04:06.013 --> 04:08.449
All right, Supergirl,
what are we working with?

04:10.451 --> 04:12.586
Looks like it's taken a few
bumps and bruises.

04:12.620 --> 04:13.787
I'm going to approach.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.756
Copy that.
Proceed with caution.

04:15.789 --> 04:18.359
SUPERGIRL:
Any idea where the front door
is on this thing?

04:27.868 --> 04:29.937
I'm assuming that
wasn't friendly fire.

04:38.646 --> 04:39.813
Supergirl, watch out!

04:43.551 --> 04:44.585
(BEEPING RAPIDLY)

04:44.618 --> 04:46.354
J'onn, she's losing altitude.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.421
I'm trapped!

04:47.455 --> 04:48.989
I'm going up there.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.991
-Right behind you.
-SUPERGIRL: No, no. Wait!
Wait, I can do it.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.893
(GRUNTING)

04:58.432 --> 04:59.600
Come on!

05:01.469 --> 05:02.836
(TIRES SCREECHING)

05:17.050 --> 05:18.586
(BEEPING RAPIDLY)

05:20.788 --> 05:22.089
Stop! Stop!

05:22.122 --> 05:23.757
Stand down!

05:24.592 --> 05:27.027
This is Mon-El of Daxam.

05:27.060 --> 05:30.431
To the invaders,
I will relinquish myself.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.108
Mon-El, what are you doing?

05:41.141 --> 05:42.643
I'm going up there.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.912
No, no. They literally
just tried to kill me.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.581
How do you know they won't
shoot you on sight?

05:47.615 --> 05:49.883
I don't, okay,
but they want me.

05:49.917 --> 05:51.184
This is my decision.

05:51.218 --> 05:54.788
Hey, we picked up
a honing signal on
a teleportation beam.

05:54.822 --> 05:57.057
HANK HENSHAW: The ship is
locking onto our coordinates
now.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.627
We'll have back up
ready if you need us.

06:02.530 --> 06:03.864
Are you sure about this?

06:08.602 --> 06:10.070
I'll be okay.

06:24.552 --> 06:25.753
Kara!

06:30.758 --> 06:31.659
(GASPS)

06:31.692 --> 06:32.993
Why did you follow me?

06:33.026 --> 06:34.762
I didn't want you
to come up here by yourself.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.730
Well, maybe I wanted
to come up here by myself.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.999
Why would you want
to beam yourself up
to an unknown spacecraft?

06:39.032 --> 06:41.134
'Cause, stuff...

06:41.168 --> 06:42.903
Oh, no. Mon-El...

06:49.610 --> 06:51.612
Are they bowing to us?

06:52.212 --> 06:53.914
RHEA: Mon-El?

06:57.184 --> 06:58.852
Mother?

06:59.920 --> 07:01.021
Father?

07:01.789 --> 07:03.123
My son.

07:03.156 --> 07:04.792
We finally found you.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.802
At long last.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.606
I thought you were dead.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.741
We are very
much alive, my son.

07:23.911 --> 07:26.213
My apologies, Kryptonian,
if you were hurt before.

07:26.246 --> 07:29.483
We were only defending
ourselves against your attack
on our ship.

07:29.517 --> 07:31.084
Attack? (CHUCKLES)

07:31.118 --> 07:34.221
I seem to recall
you shooting first.

07:34.254 --> 07:38.759
Shall we go through
the entire history
of Krypton's carnage?

07:38.792 --> 07:42.129
Mother, father,
this is Kara Zor-El.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.631
Hero of Earth.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.868
And, Kara,
these are my parents.

07:47.901 --> 07:52.105
Queen Rhea and
King Lar Gand of Daxam.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.043
Which makes you...

07:57.745 --> 07:58.912
The Prince.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.816
RHEA: Our Prince.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.718
Thank the Gods you're alive.

08:04.752 --> 08:07.120
And returned to us at last.

08:08.288 --> 08:10.691
So, tonight, we feast!

08:10.724 --> 08:12.292
Oh, oh, I can't stay.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.228
I'm also a hero.
Well, trying to be
with Kara's help and...

08:15.262 --> 08:16.263
Anyway, we have to get...

08:16.296 --> 08:18.599
Son, you can't leave.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.100
We've searched the stars
to find you.

08:20.133 --> 08:23.604
And we must get
to know Kara as well.

08:23.637 --> 08:24.938
(CHUCKLES)

08:24.972 --> 08:27.641
And I would love
to know more about you.

08:27.675 --> 08:31.111
I knew you wouldn't
stand in the way
of a family reunion.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.280
We have much to discuss.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.115
You have no idea.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.023
(SINGING)

08:44.324 --> 08:45.793
(EXCLAIMS)

08:48.228 --> 08:49.763
(PHONE RINGING)

08:49.797 --> 08:52.265
Hey, Maggie!
My favorite pool shark.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.702
What can I do you for?

08:54.735 --> 08:57.004
(LAUGHS) Oh, you know.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.039
Oh.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.176
Sure... Yes.

09:03.210 --> 09:06.914
I would love to swing on
by my local police station.

09:06.947 --> 09:08.916
I will,
I will bring the donuts.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.183
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

09:15.222 --> 09:17.691
-Can we continue?
-Sorry, I'm stress eating.

09:17.725 --> 09:20.193
Well, if you're
telling me the truth,
there's no need for stress.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.528
I'm very uncomfortable.

09:21.561 --> 09:25.098
And police stations,
my dad had a thing
with law enforcement,

09:25.132 --> 09:26.900
it's just like a whole...
I don't know.

09:26.934 --> 09:29.369
Were you at the National City
Art Museum last night?

09:29.402 --> 09:30.804
Briefly.

09:30.838 --> 09:32.139
What did you do
while you were there?

09:32.172 --> 09:33.273
Looking at some art.

09:33.306 --> 09:35.843
-In the middle of the night?
-The lines are shorter.

09:35.876 --> 09:36.977
Winn, come on.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.713
Okay, fine. Fine.

09:39.747 --> 09:43.717
Lyra and I,
we broke in after hours.

09:43.751 --> 09:48.088
It's just, like, when a
beautiful woman asks you to do
something, you gotta do it!

09:48.121 --> 09:49.122
Right, you know?

09:50.057 --> 09:51.859
Do you recognize
that painting?

09:53.326 --> 09:54.895
That is Starry Night.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.730
Uh, classic paint by numbers.

09:56.764 --> 09:59.032
Well, that classic
went missing from
the museum last night.

09:59.066 --> 10:00.934
Someone stole a Van Gogh?

10:02.302 --> 10:04.337
Oh, no, well, I mean
I didn't see anything.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.273
No, I mean maybe Lyra did.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.041
But listen,
we're happy to help,

10:08.075 --> 10:11.344
but if I didn't actually
witness anything,
can I just...

10:11.378 --> 10:13.847
Hey! Look at that
photogenic fella.

10:13.881 --> 10:15.048
(CHUCKLES)

10:18.886 --> 10:20.087
Wait, where's my girlfriend?

10:22.756 --> 10:24.224
Uh...

10:24.257 --> 10:25.325
(STUTTERING)

10:27.728 --> 10:29.730
You get how that looks, right?

10:29.763 --> 10:30.998
So, let's review.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.233
You've admitted to being
at the scene of a crime,

10:33.266 --> 10:36.970
and the security footage
doesn't show anyone else
but you.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.305
Any thoughts?

10:38.338 --> 10:41.374
I think I'm gonna need
that one phone call.

10:46.013 --> 10:48.081
LAR GAND: Where's that
appetite of yours?

10:48.115 --> 10:50.083
Aren't you happy to see us?

10:50.117 --> 10:52.285
Of course, of course I am.

10:52.319 --> 10:55.088
Or have you been distracted
by Kryptonians in capes

10:55.122 --> 10:56.990
since you fled Daxam?

10:58.391 --> 10:59.927
How did you find me?

10:59.960 --> 11:01.762
LAR GAND:
We heard your beacon.

11:01.795 --> 11:04.431
The transmission was
incomplete, it brought
us to this galaxy.

11:04.464 --> 11:06.967
Then it was just a matter
of gathering the bread crumbs.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.770
We had our greatest success
at Slavers' Moon.

11:09.803 --> 11:14.441
We heard from one of our
Dominator ambassadors that
you've been freeing slaves.

11:14.474 --> 11:18.178
Yes, imagine our surprise
at your heroics.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.280
Your influence, I'm sure.

11:20.313 --> 11:23.150
KARA: We freed them
from being treated
like animals.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.052
They weren't goods
to be traded.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.955
There's that famous
Kryptonian exaggeration.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.923
(LAR GAND SIGHS)

11:29.957 --> 11:31.391
Mon-El, you remember how well
your servants were treated
at the palace.

11:31.424 --> 11:32.359
Just like family.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.427
Because you stole them
from their families.

11:34.461 --> 11:38.398
We liberated them
from greater hardship.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.100
We gave them a path.

11:41.902 --> 11:44.504
How did you escape the blasts?

11:44.537 --> 11:46.473
I thought you were dead.

11:46.506 --> 11:49.042
When Krypton exploded,
the Kryptonite rained down,
killing everything.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.745
We had to get off
planet to persevere.

11:51.779 --> 11:53.280
RHEA: And to find you.

11:53.313 --> 11:56.917
So that we might return,
now that the atmosphere
is hospitable.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.119
To make Daxam great again.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.922
Daxam was never great.

12:01.955 --> 12:05.826
Has the Kryptonian rubbed off
on you so much so that
you have forgotten?

12:05.859 --> 12:09.162
I know you're fond of a pretty
face, but be reasonable.

12:09.196 --> 12:13.433
Well, I think what he might
find novel about me
is integrity.

12:13.466 --> 12:16.369
You know, let's not argue
about worlds of old.

12:16.403 --> 12:19.206
Why don't you tell us
of your journey
and how you survived?

12:19.239 --> 12:23.210
Yes. I would love
to hear about that.

12:23.243 --> 12:27.047
-I'd rather not.
-No, no, Prince, by all means.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.183
Please tell us
of your heroic escape.

12:39.559 --> 12:40.994
My Lord.

12:41.494 --> 12:42.863
What's going on?

12:42.896 --> 12:44.064
(RUMBLING)

12:44.097 --> 12:45.899
My Lord, we need
to evacuate immediately.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.100
No!

12:50.603 --> 12:52.005
There's no time.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.573
-Please, don't leave me.
-Leave her, come on!

12:53.606 --> 12:55.909
GIRL: Take me with you!

12:55.943 --> 12:57.077
(WHIMPERING)

13:04.852 --> 13:06.086
Come on. Go!

13:10.590 --> 13:11.791
(GROANS)

13:16.029 --> 13:17.197
Leave them!

13:17.564 --> 13:18.565
Come on!

13:22.870 --> 13:24.004
What are you doing?

13:24.037 --> 13:25.272
Please, I need to return
to Krypton.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.507
Your home is gone
and taking us with it.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.342
This is your punishment.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.078
No!

13:31.111 --> 13:32.279
Quick. Get in!

13:37.017 --> 13:38.151
(INDISTINCT SCREAMS)

13:41.654 --> 13:43.223
Go! Now!

13:53.901 --> 13:55.368
And that's how I got out.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.306
RHEA:
My son, you were so brave,

13:59.339 --> 14:03.376
and your Guard
dines at the Gods' table.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.145
Hail Mon-El,

14:05.178 --> 14:07.147
Prince of Daxam.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.649
Please, excuse me,
I have business to attend
to on Earth.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.151
I have to go.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.419
Excuse me. I, uh...

14:12.452 --> 14:15.122
(CLEARS THROAT)
I must attend, as well.

14:23.964 --> 14:28.368
So, you survived the first
dinner with the fam...

14:28.401 --> 14:30.470
-You're a liar.
-I'm sorry, okay?

14:30.503 --> 14:33.306
Can you really blame me for
wanting to just be Mon-El,
a regular guy from Daxam?

14:33.340 --> 14:34.441
Oh, wow.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.476
With how you feel about
Daxamites, if you had known

14:36.509 --> 14:38.245
that I was the crown prince,
would you even talk to me?

14:38.278 --> 14:40.047
You didn't even
give me the chance.

14:40.080 --> 14:43.183
I tried to tell you so many
times, okay? I really did.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.052
What, is that supposed
to make this better?

14:45.085 --> 14:46.987
Me being the prince
doesn't change anything.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.188
Not how I feel about you...

14:48.221 --> 14:50.557
This changes everything.

14:50.590 --> 14:54.928
It's bad enough you lied,
but you being the prince?

14:54.962 --> 14:58.598
I thought you were just
born on a cruel planet,
but you lead it.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.234
You benefited from
its cruelty.

15:01.268 --> 15:04.037
What about that
Kryptonian Emissary?

15:04.071 --> 15:05.305
Your guard...

15:05.338 --> 15:06.673
Do you even feel guilty?

15:08.141 --> 15:10.410
Of course I do.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.512
I can't even look at you.

15:13.513 --> 15:14.514
(WHOOSHES)

15:21.254 --> 15:22.655
I'm telling you,
we did not take anything.

15:22.689 --> 15:25.125
I believe that you didn't,
but what about Lyra?

15:25.158 --> 15:27.127
She would never. That...

15:27.160 --> 15:29.229
Hey. We got your call.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.098
You okay, bro?

15:31.131 --> 15:34.134
A heads up next time
would be nice before
you arrest my friend.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.602
Come on, you know that's
not how this works.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.737
I don't intervene
with your job and
you don't question mine.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.406
You better have proof.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.474
She doesn't. The crappy angle
doesn't even show Lyra.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.310
I don't think that's
a coincidence.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.278
-You think she set him up?
-Exactly.

15:45.312 --> 15:46.946
When was the last time
you spoke to Lyra?

15:48.248 --> 15:50.283
I mean, I've been trying
to call her all day.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.252
Let me guess,
her phone is disconnected.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.320
(SIGHS) I don't get it.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.155
She framed you, Winn.

15:55.188 --> 15:57.424
Look, I got a partner
out there who thinks
that you're going to be

15:57.457 --> 16:00.293
his 30th arrest of the month.
That's a station record.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.229
I need proof that
you weren't involved,

16:02.262 --> 16:05.298
or they're going to pin this
on you, and I won't be
able to stop them.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.000
If it's proof you need,
then we'll get it.

16:07.034 --> 16:10.437
Release Winn to us, okay?
Give us 48 hours.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.372
You want me to let
my prime suspect walk?

16:12.405 --> 16:14.641
If we're wanna catch Lyra,
then we need Winn.

16:14.674 --> 16:15.675
Two days.

16:19.679 --> 16:20.713
And look at that.

16:20.747 --> 16:23.083
Looks like McConnell
forgot to sign the warrant.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.451
You've got 24 hours.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.054
A minute longer and
I'm coming for him myself.

16:27.087 --> 16:28.455
She femme-fataled me.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.190
Well, you certainly
have a type.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.358
(GROANS)

16:32.292 --> 16:35.028
Thank you.

16:35.062 --> 16:38.398
We've examined this footage
frame by frame,
she's just not there.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.133
Uh, well, she was there.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.434
And I have the bruises.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.803
They're wonderful bruises.
And well...

16:43.836 --> 16:45.305
Please don't point
to where they are.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.606
Winn, who are her people?

16:46.639 --> 16:47.474
Valerians.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.276
Valerians can't be seen
in photographs.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.777
Or on security cameras.

16:50.810 --> 16:54.114
And there's no picture of her
in her amnesty file either.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.182
Oh.

16:55.215 --> 16:56.649
So, I have
an invisible girlfriend.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.685
So she used your tech skills
to get into the museum,

16:58.718 --> 17:01.188
and then she pulled
the disappearing act
to make the grab.

17:01.221 --> 17:04.057
Well, it looks like this
wasn't her first time either.

17:04.091 --> 17:05.558
Check it out.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.694
There have been two
other major heists
in the past nine months.

17:07.727 --> 17:11.398
We had a Rodin stolen
from the Modern Arts
and Cultural Museum

17:11.431 --> 17:15.102
and an original Warhol
taken from the
Art Institute of Metropolis.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.369
Yes, same MO.

17:16.403 --> 17:18.305
Both perps claimed their
girlfriend set them up.

17:19.206 --> 17:20.640
Sorry, Winn.

17:20.673 --> 17:23.143
Oh, no, don't apologize.
It's not your fault
I'm an idiot.

17:23.176 --> 17:27.147
Hey, sometimes the people
closest to us are our
biggest blind spots.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.815
Do you know where she lives?
Where we could find her now?

17:28.848 --> 17:30.717
No, we've only ever
been to my place.

17:30.750 --> 17:34.287
Ah, I know she's
from Starhaven and she
came by herself

17:34.321 --> 17:35.722
and that she's registered.

17:35.755 --> 17:39.259
The address she's registered
under looks like a fake.

17:39.292 --> 17:40.760
Well, great.

17:40.793 --> 17:43.530
-I mean, the Alien bar,
it's where we met.
-It's a start.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.098
Let's go catch a thief.

17:45.132 --> 17:47.534
Yes, super friends
back in the habit.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.302
-Hmm, Kara?
-Sorry, sorry.

17:49.336 --> 17:50.737
-That's too much.
-Mmm-hmm.

17:50.770 --> 17:53.240
Should we, uh...
Should we, uh, get Mon-El?

17:53.273 --> 17:54.474
No.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.476
You know what, um...

17:56.509 --> 17:58.711
You guys go ahead,
I'll catch up.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.450
Maybe you should
sit this one out.

18:03.483 --> 18:04.517
Are you kidding? No!

18:04.551 --> 18:07.854
I'm ready to Nancy Drew
the crap out of this!

18:07.887 --> 18:11.491
Okay, enough with
the over-enthusiastic
deflecting, all right.

18:11.524 --> 18:12.825
I know you're upset
with Mon-El.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.761
And you have
every right to be.

18:14.794 --> 18:15.895
Okay? Own it.

18:15.928 --> 18:19.566
I just, uh...
I hate him right now.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.768
I get it, and I hate
that he hurt you,

18:21.801 --> 18:23.903
but relationships have their
ups and downs, Kara.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.906
Yeah, but this is more
than a down, Alex.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.842
I don't even know
who he is anymore.

18:29.876 --> 18:32.479
Do you know why Daxam
was such a party planet?

18:32.512 --> 18:35.915
Because the Royal Family
kept their subjects drunk
and distracted,

18:35.948 --> 18:39.519
so they didn't recognize
how oppressed they were.

18:39.552 --> 18:40.920
Mon-El was a part of that.

18:40.953 --> 18:44.324
Kara, maybe Mon-El
is an evil prince.

18:44.357 --> 18:47.360
But maybe he's just a guy
who's ashamed of his past,

18:47.394 --> 18:49.929
and he's looking
for a fresh start.

18:49.962 --> 18:53.233
Talk to him, okay?
Give him a chance to explain.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.569
Kara Zor-El.

18:57.437 --> 18:59.539
Stand down! Stand down!

18:59.572 --> 19:00.807
Do not engage!

19:00.840 --> 19:03.176
Do not engage!

19:06.479 --> 19:08.548
I need to speak with you.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.189
(GRUNTS)

19:16.223 --> 19:17.757
Anyone ever tell you
you've got anger issues?

19:17.790 --> 19:20.260
I prefer the term
leadership skills.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.295
Ah, Worris,
we're looking for a girl.

19:22.329 --> 19:24.364
Aren't we all?

19:24.397 --> 19:27.300
I'd answer her questions,
'cause this table's not
getting any softer, buddy.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.668
Lyra Strayd, she's a Valerian.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.537
She's been involved
in a string of art thefts.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.772
-I've never heard of her.
-Come on, blonde hair,
blue eyes.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.407
The chin of
a serial backstabber.

19:34.441 --> 19:37.310
Even if I did know something,
why would I tell you?

19:37.344 --> 19:39.612
Okay, what's it gonna cost us?

19:42.449 --> 19:43.616
Hamilton tickets.

19:44.884 --> 19:45.885
Orchestra.

19:45.918 --> 19:46.786
(SIGHS)

19:46.819 --> 19:48.488
Okay, well, we're screwed.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.723
Deal.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.592
Her kind hangs out
at the trailer park.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.394
Up near Blackmore.

19:54.427 --> 19:55.795
That's where she'd be.

19:57.930 --> 20:00.233
Hamilton? How you going
to pull that one off?

20:00.267 --> 20:03.536
The guy who plays King George
is from Rimbor Five.
He owes me a favor.

20:11.744 --> 20:15.348
Your new world
is quite stunning.

20:15.382 --> 20:18.251
Like Daxam used to be.

20:18.285 --> 20:21.821
I didn't thank you earlier
for looking after my son.

20:21.854 --> 20:24.857
A Kryptonian taking
care of a Daxamite.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.394
And I thought I'd seen it all.

20:27.427 --> 20:30.397
But you didn't come here
all this way just to thank me.

20:30.430 --> 20:31.831
No, I didn't.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.435
I need your help.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.537
Daxam is a wasteland.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.606
Our people are scattered
across the universe.

20:39.639 --> 20:41.941
We need to bring them home.

20:41.974 --> 20:45.345
Rebuild what your
people destroyed.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.348
I don't say it to offend.

20:48.381 --> 20:49.816
No, no. You're right.

20:49.849 --> 20:53.386
Krypton made
horrible mistakes.
I can admit it.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.355
That's more than I expected.

20:55.388 --> 20:56.789
What do you want from me?

20:56.823 --> 21:00.927
Our planet died on my
and my husband's watch.

21:00.960 --> 21:04.531
For our people to rise again,
they need a future.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.633
Mon-El is young.

21:07.667 --> 21:10.803
He can be the face
of that future.

21:10.837 --> 21:13.005
You want to take Mon-El
back to Daxam?

21:13.039 --> 21:17.076
Would you rather he stay here
and learn by degrees that
he's not good enough for you?

21:17.109 --> 21:20.680
-You don't know me.
-I know your kind.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.949
I know what
your integrity means.

21:22.982 --> 21:26.419
He's Daxamite royalty
and you're starting
to despise him for it...

21:26.453 --> 21:28.020
I don't despise anyone.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.923
But you think you're
better than him.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.024
Than us.

21:33.660 --> 21:36.763
Do what's best for him.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.532
Tell him to speak
to his parents.

21:39.566 --> 21:42.669
The people who love him.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.637
And what makes you think
he'll listen to me?

21:44.671 --> 21:47.006
Because he's under your spell.

21:47.039 --> 21:51.043
And he has no idea
how unforgiving
your people can be.

21:58.618 --> 21:59.852
(KNOCKING)

22:01.854 --> 22:03.823
You shouldn't be here.

22:05.858 --> 22:07.627
Where should I be, then?

22:07.660 --> 22:08.828
Hmm?

22:08.861 --> 22:10.830
Just rotting in jail?

22:10.863 --> 22:12.965
If it's any consolation,
it wasn't personal.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.535
What took you so long, hmm?

22:15.568 --> 22:18.505
I mean, you've had plenty of
other opportunities
to dupe me.

22:18.538 --> 22:19.972
Don't you know how marks work?

22:20.006 --> 22:23.042
You have to gain their trust.

22:23.075 --> 22:25.512
It's called a long con
for a reason.

22:25.545 --> 22:27.079
No, I don't believe you.

22:27.113 --> 22:29.516
Come here and
look me in the eyes.

22:29.549 --> 22:32.051
And if you can tell me that
you didn't care for me,
that I'm just some mark,

22:32.084 --> 22:33.953
then I will walk away
right now.

22:39.158 --> 22:40.727
You...

22:40.760 --> 22:41.928
Were...

22:41.961 --> 22:43.029
A...

22:43.062 --> 22:44.063
Mark.

22:51.638 --> 22:53.473
Okay, have it your way.

22:57.444 --> 22:58.711
GUARDIAN:
You're coming with us.

22:58.745 --> 23:00.146
LYRA:
Oh, you brought back up?

23:00.179 --> 23:02.715
So did I, and mine kill.

23:03.483 --> 23:04.817
Does yours?

23:13.092 --> 23:15.728
You get Lyra, I got these two.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.946
You should have run when
you had the chance.

23:33.980 --> 23:36.616

23:44.557 --> 23:45.558
Not today.

23:47.527 --> 23:48.528
(GRUNTING)

23:55.802 --> 23:57.003
Stay down.

24:01.808 --> 24:03.175

24:07.814 --> 24:09.115
No! No!

24:09.148 --> 24:11.784
-No! No!
-The painting.

24:11.818 --> 24:13.486
Where is it?

24:13.520 --> 24:14.521
I got it.

24:15.822 --> 24:17.790
You have no idea
what you've done.

24:17.824 --> 24:19.626
(LYRA PANTING)

24:23.630 --> 24:24.997
Hey!

24:25.031 --> 24:27.266
So, have you just been playing
me this whole time?

24:27.299 --> 24:29.068
What does it matter?

24:29.101 --> 24:30.269
You wouldn't understand.

24:30.302 --> 24:33.072
Why don't you
help me understand?

24:33.105 --> 24:35.508
Tell me the truth for once.

24:36.709 --> 24:37.944
It's my brother.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.245
They've got him.

24:39.278 --> 24:41.781
No, you told me that you
came here alone.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.550
LYRA:
I told you a lot of things.

24:43.583 --> 24:45.518
He's as good as dead
now, thanks to you
and your friends.

24:45.552 --> 24:49.121
If I'd known your
brother was in danger,
I would have helped you.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.690
Why would you help me?

24:50.723 --> 24:53.225
Because I care about you.

24:53.259 --> 24:55.928
I need you to tell
me the truth.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.232
You want the truth?

25:00.266 --> 25:03.102
You want to know about
the 10-year war on Starhaven?

25:03.135 --> 25:06.105
You wanna hear
about how I watched
my parents starve to death?

25:06.138 --> 25:09.241
Or do you want to know
why I can't be alone
in the dark anymore?

25:09.275 --> 25:12.211
'Cause it reminds me of the
six weeks I was locked
below deck

25:12.244 --> 25:15.682
when me and my brother
were smuggled onto Earth.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.249
I'm a refugee.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.152
I'm a thief, too.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.021
That's the truth.

25:22.054 --> 25:24.056
Maybe it's also true that...

25:24.924 --> 25:26.726
You were different.

25:28.661 --> 25:30.129
I liked you.

25:34.801 --> 25:35.902
Why did...

25:35.935 --> 25:38.037
Why did you con me?

25:38.070 --> 25:39.939
That gang.

25:41.307 --> 25:43.042
My brother, Bastian,
works for them,

25:43.075 --> 25:45.878
but he hasn't been
carrying his weight.

25:45.912 --> 25:48.080
I told them
I'd clear his debt.

25:51.818 --> 25:53.986
I didn't want to use you.

25:54.821 --> 25:57.056
I had to.

25:57.089 --> 26:00.359
And now, if I don't get
that painting to them
by the end of today,

26:00.392 --> 26:02.228
they'll kill him.

26:06.699 --> 26:07.767
Who's the buyer?

26:12.238 --> 26:15.775
Okay, so, the fence is some
guy named Mandrax.

26:15.808 --> 26:19.178
Mandrax was a resident of
Fort Rozz for quite some time.

26:19.211 --> 26:21.113
After Fort Rozz crashed,
he escaped.

26:21.147 --> 26:23.916
Since then, he's been
a big player in the
art trafficking business.

26:23.950 --> 26:25.384
Earth art is big money.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.920
Yes, it's great that Picasso
is intergalactically adored.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.822
What do you want to do?

26:29.856 --> 26:31.658
All right, here's the plan.
We go in, we give
them the painting.

26:31.691 --> 26:33.292
We get back
Lyra's kid brother.
We get out.

26:33.325 --> 26:36.328
Done and done, right?
Lives saved, heroes praised.

26:36.362 --> 26:39.231
Agent Schott,
we have an intergalactic
art-smuggling ring,

26:39.265 --> 26:43.369
and one of National City's
most violent alien gangs
in our grasp.

26:43.402 --> 26:45.638
-Ms. Strayd...
-Needs our help.

26:45.672 --> 26:48.040
-Is an admitted con artist.
-Her brother is in danger.

26:48.074 --> 26:50.142
Have you ever met
this brother?

26:50.176 --> 26:53.279
Or could this possibly be just
another con from a woman
who knows how to play you?

26:54.180 --> 26:56.148
I believe her.

26:56.182 --> 26:58.184
I know you do.

26:58.217 --> 27:00.419
But I can't afford to.

27:00.452 --> 27:03.690
We'll investigate Mandrax
and proceed accordingly.

What are you doing?

27:19.438 --> 27:20.639
Trust me.

27:26.879 --> 27:30.082
Hey, hey. I've been doing
some very serious research

27:30.116 --> 27:31.751
on human relationships.

27:31.784 --> 27:35.287
And by now,
in the movie, the girl
usually forgives the guy

27:35.321 --> 27:36.689
for whatever dumb
thing he's done.

27:36.723 --> 27:38.357
I had a nice chat
with your mother.

27:40.793 --> 27:43.029
Yeah. Okay. Uh...

27:43.062 --> 27:44.797
-What does she want?
-You.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.933
-She wants to talk to you.
-I'm not going back there.

27:46.966 --> 27:48.034
Well, I tried.

27:48.067 --> 27:49.168
What, that's it?

27:49.201 --> 27:51.203
What else am
I supposed to say?

27:51.237 --> 27:53.139
Nothing's changed for me.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.007
Just tell me what to do, okay?
Tell me what it is
and I will fix it.

27:55.041 --> 27:56.475
You can't! Okay?

27:56.508 --> 27:58.477
You can't take back the fact
that you lied to me.

27:58.510 --> 28:01.280
-You can't un-ring that bell.
-Well, I can try.

28:01.313 --> 28:04.016
Just forget about you
and me for one second.

28:04.050 --> 28:09.355
Do you even understand
the second chance
you've been given?

28:09.388 --> 28:12.792
You thought you were the last
Daxamite and you're not.

28:12.825 --> 28:14.861
Your people are alive.

28:14.894 --> 28:16.929
Your parents are alive.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.498
They need you.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.467
They love you.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.402
Don't just throw
that chance away,

28:23.435 --> 28:26.205
'cause many of us
don't get one.

so start acting like it.

you would let him go.

you just let him go?

Before I lose you forever.

34:57.196 --> 34:59.698
'Cause I owe you a lot...

34:59.731 --> 35:01.800
But most of all,
I owe you the truth.

35:07.539 --> 35:09.408
My name is Mon-El.

35:10.776 --> 35:14.546
I'm the former
Prince of Daxam.

35:14.580 --> 35:18.450
And I was a spoiled,
useless person,
that I didn't know.

35:21.420 --> 35:22.721
Until I met you.

35:22.754 --> 35:25.624
And I love being
a hero because

35:25.657 --> 35:29.695
it means I get to spend
every single day by your side.

35:31.263 --> 35:35.567
And I love the way that
you're honest to a fault.

35:35.601 --> 35:39.671
And the way that you fight
for those you care for.

35:43.575 --> 35:45.344
And I love you.

35:49.548 --> 35:53.785
With everything that I have,
I love you.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.822
You are so special.

35:57.589 --> 36:00.292
Yeah, I know that.

36:00.326 --> 36:02.494
I deserve better
than being lied to.

36:02.528 --> 36:05.831
You do and I'm sorry for that.

36:05.864 --> 36:07.833
You're right, okay?
I'm a liar.

36:07.866 --> 36:11.737
And I really hope
that you can still see
the good in me.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.272
Please.

36:21.747 --> 36:24.750
Were you ever
gonna tell me the truth?

36:31.357 --> 36:32.524
I don't know.

36:46.004 --> 36:48.340
You just want things
to be easy, Mon-El.

36:48.374 --> 36:50.676
But being a hero
and falling in love,

36:50.709 --> 36:53.211
those are not easy things.

36:54.413 --> 36:56.515
They're hard
and they're messy.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.016
And they hurt sometimes.

36:58.049 --> 37:01.620
-I would never hurt
you on purpose...
-Well, you won't again.

37:01.653 --> 37:04.823
-Kara, don't.
-I can't... I can't do this.

37:05.524 --> 37:07.225
No. It's over.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.276
(SOBBING)

37:29.848 --> 37:30.849
Son.

37:30.882 --> 37:31.917
We knew you would return.

37:31.950 --> 37:33.352
Well, Kara ended it.

37:33.385 --> 37:35.321
She did what's best for you.

37:35.354 --> 37:36.555
It was never going to last.

37:36.588 --> 37:37.856
Yeah, did you tell her that?

37:37.889 --> 37:40.392
Enough about
the Kryptonian girl.

37:40.426 --> 37:42.661
You have nothing
tethering you here.

37:42.694 --> 37:44.463
Return with us to Daxam.

37:44.496 --> 37:45.564
Unite our people.

37:45.597 --> 37:46.598
No.

37:47.366 --> 37:48.367
Excuse me?

37:50.702 --> 37:52.538
No.

37:52.571 --> 37:54.806
You never cared about
our people before.

37:54.840 --> 37:56.342
Things will be
different this time.

37:56.375 --> 37:58.310
MON-EL: They won't.
It'll be more of the same.

37:58.344 --> 38:00.912
I think about our lives there
and it makes me ill.

38:00.946 --> 38:03.382
I detest who I was.

38:03.415 --> 38:04.716
I was ignorant,

38:04.750 --> 38:07.653
and blind to those
around me and letting
myself be propped up

38:07.686 --> 38:09.655
at the expense of our people.

38:09.688 --> 38:13.024
And I'm tired of being served
and I'm tired of taking
the easy way out.

38:13.058 --> 38:15.093
And I'm done being
your prince.

38:15.126 --> 38:17.363
You sound just like her.

38:17.396 --> 38:20.098
-That Kryptonian girl
has poisoned you...
-No!

38:20.131 --> 38:23.635
Mother, that woman
is the best thing that's
ever happened to me.

38:23.669 --> 38:25.103
The best thing I know.

38:25.136 --> 38:26.605
And whether we're
together or not,

38:26.638 --> 38:28.407
being near her,
it makes me a better person.

38:28.440 --> 38:31.009
It makes me the person
that I want to be.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.987
I wish you no ill will,

38:43.555 --> 38:45.624
but you should leave
this planet

38:45.657 --> 38:47.359
and never return.

38:49.127 --> 38:50.996
Now send me back.

38:51.730 --> 38:54.099
Send me home, now!

38:55.000 --> 38:56.635
As you wish.

39:11.049 --> 39:13.051
Hey, hey!
How you doing, buddy?

39:13.084 --> 39:14.420
Getting there.

39:14.453 --> 39:16.988
I got a little something
to perk you up.

39:17.756 --> 39:19.558
(WHISTLES)

39:19.591 --> 39:22.661
So I just finished running
diagnostics on
this little beauty.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.996
And it, my friend,
is in tip top shape.

39:25.030 --> 39:28.967
I just gotta say
that I'm pretty sure
this Cisco fellow and I

39:29.000 --> 39:32.404
would just be BFFs if,
you know, we lived in
the same dimension.

39:32.438 --> 39:34.540
Yeah, don't tempt me.
'Cause I could use an...

39:36.708 --> 39:39.745
Inter-dimensional,
post-break up vacay.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.682
HANK HENSHAW:
Morning, everyone.

39:43.715 --> 39:47.152
Now, we have a new prisoner
coming in today.

39:47.185 --> 39:51.156
He's not our typical guest,
so look sharp.

39:57.763 --> 40:00.198
Oh, he looks fun.

40:00.231 --> 40:03.068
Oh, there you are.

40:03.101 --> 40:06.438
Uh... Uh...
Who, me?

40:06.472 --> 40:11.009
Yes, yes, you. Why else do
you think I'd let myself be
caught? Come on.

40:11.042 --> 40:12.878
She's funny.

40:12.911 --> 40:14.480
I've been looking for you.

40:23.154 --> 40:24.490
Supergirl?

40:33.164 --> 40:35.667
-Prisoner, stand down!
-Thank you.

40:35.701 --> 40:36.902
Drop your weapon!

40:36.935 --> 40:39.938
Oh, this isn't a weapon.
This is part of my
brilliant escape.

40:39.971 --> 40:43.208
Ladies and gentlemen,
this dimension has been
so much fun.

40:43.241 --> 40:47.045
I've had a blast!
But I gotta go chase
down the fastest man alive.

40:47.646 --> 40:48.647
Toodles!

40:55.086 --> 40:57.789
-Oh.
-Supergirl, are you okay?

40:57.823 --> 40:59.525
MON-EL: Kara?

40:59.558 --> 41:01.593
Kara, can you hear us?

41:01.627 --> 41:02.628
Kara?

41:07.098 --> 41:08.834
MON-EL: Kara, can you hear me?

41:08.867 --> 41:10.201
(GASPS)

41:10.235 --> 41:11.837
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

41:11.870 --> 41:12.871
Kara?

41:13.672 --> 41:14.840
Kara?

41:14.873 --> 41:15.874
(DOOR OPENING)

41:17.208 --> 41:18.844
You're on!

41:18.877 --> 41:20.211
On what?

41:20.245 --> 41:22.180
Come on! Come on, come on!

41:24.983 --> 41:26.117
Johnny canceled on us.

41:26.151 --> 41:27.285
You got the bump.

41:27.318 --> 41:29.187
You're the new opening act,
kid!

41:29.220 --> 41:31.657
-I...
-MAN: Go on, go on, go on!

41:31.690 --> 41:32.691
Okay.

41:35.260 --> 41:37.128
(MUSIC PLAYING)

41:42.000 --> 41:43.234
(CLEARS THROAT)
