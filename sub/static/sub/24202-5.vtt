WEBVTT

00:00.703 --> 00:02.906
- Do I need that much protein?
- I think you do.

00:02.912 --> 00:04.291
But it also has creatine.

00:04.297 --> 00:06.009
And? You want gainz?

00:06.015 --> 00:08.611
Well, yeah, I do, but I
also want liver function.

00:08.617 --> 00:11.095
Well, don't call me
crying from your plateau.

00:11.101 --> 00:13.290
Stop pretending that you
know about this stuff.

00:13.296 --> 00:16.190
When we first got divorced,
we weren't nearly this chummy,

00:16.197 --> 00:17.595
but time had passed.

00:17.601 --> 00:18.908
Okay, hot oven!

00:18.914 --> 00:20.312
Things have become chill.

00:20.893 --> 00:22.704
Mmm, cinnamon! Nice touch, Mom!

00:22.710 --> 00:26.172
We were both thankful, and
so was the rest of the family.

00:26.178 --> 00:28.171
Because even though we
were no longer together...

00:28.177 --> 00:30.983
It just made sense for
us to do things together.

00:31.180 --> 00:32.664
Football time for me, guys.

00:32.670 --> 00:35.197
I will clean up later.
I promise. I promise.

00:35.284 --> 00:38.866
Which made every day feel
like Christmas morning.

00:39.098 --> 00:41.888
We need to get batteries for
that. Anybody want anything?

00:41.894 --> 00:43.605
I'll have a mimosa,
if you're making them.

00:43.683 --> 00:45.087
Kids, school!

00:45.093 --> 00:47.286
And by the time
spring rolled around...

00:47.361 --> 00:48.812
We were total buds.

00:49.261 --> 00:51.964
It was hard to believe,
but we'd recovered from...

00:51.970 --> 00:54.159
I am done! I am done
with the scrutiny.

00:54.165 --> 00:55.760
That fight changed us.

00:55.766 --> 00:57.991
- You deserve someone who feels that way about you.
- I realized...

00:57.997 --> 00:59.687
I wasn't ready to be dating.

01:00.001 --> 01:02.089

01:34.632 --> 01:36.232
Uh, oh, good. He's... he's good.

01:36.238 --> 01:38.555
He, uh... Going into
second grade, so he made it.

01:38.561 --> 01:40.847
I always felt bad I couldn't
help more with his issue.

01:40.853 --> 01:42.966
Oh, what with the peeing
in the flower bed thing?

01:42.972 --> 01:44.859
No, he stopped that
on his own months ago.

01:44.865 --> 01:46.562
The kid's got a bright future.

No, I meant the whole
"serial-killer" handwriting.

01:49.318 --> 01:51.195
Oh, right. Yeah. That.

01:51.201 --> 01:54.716
I kept telling your wife his
penmanship was totally age-appropriate.

01:54.722 --> 01:56.882
Yeah, well, I kept telling her
we're all gonna be speaking Mandarin

01:56.888 --> 01:59.490
- soon, right? So, who cares?
- Apparently she did.

02:00.369 --> 02:01.569
She did.

02:03.071 --> 02:04.972
So, you've been good?

02:04.978 --> 02:06.262
Me? Very!

02:06.648 --> 02:07.848
Very good.

02:08.244 --> 02:11.831
Not that good. No,
Lena and I s-separated.

02:12.220 --> 02:13.682
Actually, we... we divorced,

02:13.688 --> 02:16.985
and we're living
together still for now,

02:16.991 --> 02:19.979
but divorcedly so.
That's not a word.

02:19.985 --> 02:22.551
I ramble when I...
when I get nervous.

02:22.557 --> 02:24.251
I'm... I'm divorced.

02:24.762 --> 02:25.973
Okay.

02:26.395 --> 02:28.271
Well, my number's still good.

02:28.473 --> 02:31.381
Give me a call if you ever feel
like getting brunch or something.

02:31.387 --> 02:33.473
Oh, yeah! I always feel like
getting brunch or something.

02:33.479 --> 02:35.383
I... But I never, ever do.

02:35.554 --> 02:37.055
Maybe you should change that.

02:40.076 --> 02:43.592
Ugh! Was that
Lisa (BLEEP) Apple?

02:43.598 --> 02:45.416
God, we hated her.

02:45.687 --> 02:46.887
Did we?

02:46.893 --> 02:50.307
Yeah. Remember those big,
fake glasses she used to wear?

02:50.313 --> 02:52.196
Ugh, and she was so
"holier than thou."

02:52.202 --> 02:53.513
She was always
giving us kid advice

02:53.519 --> 02:54.719
even though she
doesn't have kids.

02:54.725 --> 02:56.024
Well, she is a tutor.

02:56.030 --> 02:58.199
What does that mean? She's
not a very good tutor.

02:58.205 --> 02:59.616
How much money did
we pay her for Milo

02:59.622 --> 03:01.605
to still write like
the Zodiac Killer?

03:01.611 --> 03:04.937
Hm, I didn't realize how
strongly we felt about her.

03:04.943 --> 03:06.718
Well, we did.

03:07.014 --> 03:09.134
Thank God she's not
in our lives anymore.

Hey, Mom. I signed you up
for the bake sale at school,

03:35.783 --> 03:37.292
- and it has to be something good.
- _

03:37.298 --> 03:38.690
So, dig deep.

03:38.696 --> 03:41.250
- Oh, can I pitch you some ideas?
- Go.

03:41.256 --> 03:43.643
What about one of those
rainbow-layer cakes?

03:43.649 --> 03:46.227
No, Eric's mom's already doing
that. It's all over her Pinterest.

03:46.233 --> 03:48.242
You follow Eric's
mom on Pinterest?

03:48.248 --> 03:49.569
She has great boards.

03:50.232 --> 03:51.744
Oh! How about this...

03:52.016 --> 03:53.426
I reinvent a classic.

03:53.609 --> 03:55.733
I like where this is going...

03:55.739 --> 03:58.256
Sea-salt dusted brondie.

03:58.262 --> 04:00.451
- Brondie? Is-is that even a word? Di...
- Brondie.

04:00.457 --> 04:01.777
did you just coin that?

04:01.991 --> 04:03.482
Oh, my gosh. I think
I just coined that.

04:03.488 --> 04:05.883
And the Nobel Prize
for brondies goes to...

04:10.670 --> 04:12.103
Lot of homework?

04:12.701 --> 04:17.293
Just an English paper on female
role models called "Nevertheless."

04:17.298 --> 04:19.903
We have to complete the phrase
by writing something remarkable

04:19.909 --> 04:21.504
our female role model has done.

04:21.510 --> 04:25.012
Oh, well, if you need to
interview me, I'm available.

04:25.018 --> 04:26.218
I chose Maya.

04:26.382 --> 04:27.584
Maya Angelou?

04:27.661 --> 04:29.979
Aunt Maya. She's a trailblazer.

04:29.985 --> 04:31.859
Uh, what has she ever blazed

04:31.865 --> 04:34.672
besides those weed
cigarettes for her "anxiety."

04:34.678 --> 04:36.180
It's more about
what she doesn't do,

04:36.186 --> 04:37.469
which is conform
to the antiquated

04:37.475 --> 04:39.554
cis-gender norms of
patriarchal society.

04:39.560 --> 04:41.048
Okay, if this is
an English paper,

04:41.054 --> 04:43.156
you should start
by speaking English.

04:43.162 --> 04:45.428
She decided to have
a kid on her own.

04:45.434 --> 04:46.962
We should celebrate that.

04:46.968 --> 04:49.498
Celebrate her
decision to have baby?

04:49.504 --> 04:50.781
She hasn't even done it yet.

04:50.787 --> 04:53.890
I've been boots on the
ground for 15 years!

04:53.896 --> 04:55.679
Yeah, but, Mom, it's 2018,

04:55.685 --> 04:57.890
and you still get
giddy about bake sales

04:57.896 --> 05:00.387
and stocking the
pantry with apple juice.

05:00.584 --> 05:03.471
I'm sorry, but you're
part of the problem.

05:03.477 --> 05:04.893
I'm part of the problem?

05:04.899 --> 05:06.503
You don't wanna shatter
the glass ceiling.

05:06.509 --> 05:09.416
You want to clean
it with Windex.

05:09.422 --> 05:10.622
Okay.

05:10.628 --> 05:13.712
First of all, I make
my own window cleaner

05:13.718 --> 05:16.411
with a combination of
white distilled vinegar

05:16.417 --> 05:18.112
and freshly
squeezed lemon juice,

05:18.118 --> 05:19.829
and the fresh lemon juice
is the most important part!

05:19.835 --> 05:22.800
Okay, listen, we're gonna
finish this conversation later!

05:25.186 --> 05:29.191
Oh, man! Look at all
these people having brunch.

05:29.580 --> 05:30.987
Is brunch funny?

05:30.993 --> 05:33.778
It is to me. I haven't
had brunch in 15 years.

05:33.784 --> 05:35.678
- You must be starving.
- I am.

05:35.684 --> 05:37.154
Oh, thank you.

05:37.745 --> 05:38.949
Thank you.

05:39.253 --> 05:41.558
- Uh-oh.
- Something wrong?

05:42.152 --> 05:45.467
You ordered pico on the
side. That is pico on the top.

05:45.473 --> 05:47.073
Oh, no biggie.

05:47.142 --> 05:49.432
Huh? "No biggie"?

05:50.026 --> 05:51.512
You don't wanna send it back?

05:51.518 --> 05:52.723
Or make me send it back

05:52.729 --> 05:54.916
so the waiter doesn't hate
you for sending it back?

05:54.922 --> 05:56.994
'Cause I-I will. I-I
can get her over here.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.102
Nope. All ends up
in the same place.

06:02.212 --> 06:05.400
It... it does end
up in the same place.

06:05.812 --> 06:07.473
That's exactly right!

06:07.652 --> 06:10.163
Were you in a long-term marriage
or an underground bunker?

06:11.174 --> 06:12.669
I am starting to wonder.

06:13.168 --> 06:15.772
And I'm seeing the
world through...

06:16.475 --> 06:17.778
brand-new eyes.

06:17.863 --> 06:20.230
- You are? Mmm.
- Mm-hmm.

06:23.120 --> 06:27.433
Mmm. I'm noticing things that
I've never noticed before.

06:27.439 --> 06:29.783
Me? You're noticing me?

06:29.789 --> 06:31.989
I am noticing the
hell out of you.

06:36.727 --> 06:38.095
Is this okay?

06:38.101 --> 06:40.001
I'll tell you in a second.

06:47.392 --> 06:49.019
Yep, it is.

06:49.941 --> 06:51.310
Were you wearing those glasses

06:51.316 --> 06:53.409
when I saw you the
other day at the market?

06:53.714 --> 06:56.011
I'm sure I was.
They're my glasses.

06:56.017 --> 06:57.715
Yeah. They're your glasses.

06:58.017 --> 06:59.629
Come on.

07:02.542 --> 07:03.882
Wow!

07:04.730 --> 07:07.146
Look at all this stuff.

07:07.152 --> 07:09.247
Dad really saved everything.

07:09.253 --> 07:13.450
Including Mom. She
looks great, though.

07:13.456 --> 07:14.676
Can I have her?

07:14.955 --> 07:16.155
Mm-hmm.

07:17.549 --> 07:19.628
She always hated
physical affection.

07:19.634 --> 07:21.455
- Yeah.
- Sorry, Mom.

07:22.447 --> 07:27.611
Yes, every awkward phase of your
lives has been lovingly preserved.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.050
You're welcome, girls.

07:30.262 --> 07:32.274
What are we even
looking for here?

07:32.280 --> 07:33.486
I don't know.

07:33.492 --> 07:35.644
Something that proves
that before I was a mom

07:35.650 --> 07:38.841
and just momming all the time,
that I was a female role model.

07:38.847 --> 07:41.117
- You were?
- Oh, look!

07:41.327 --> 07:43.729
My old Girl Scout
sash! I got every badge.

07:43.735 --> 07:46.346
Uh, that's my Halloween
costume from college.

07:46.352 --> 07:48.068
- These are joke badges.
- Mmm.

07:48.172 --> 07:50.359
- See? This one's for binge drinking.
- _

07:50.365 --> 07:52.144
I earned a lot of
those sophomore year.

07:52.150 --> 07:54.755
Okay, fine. So I'm
not a role model.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.259
Not a Michelle or
a Malala or an Amal

07:57.265 --> 07:59.746
or a Hillary or a...
Oprah or even a Gayle.

08:00.153 --> 08:01.538
If Mae did a report on me,

08:01.544 --> 08:05.263
it'd probably be titled
"Nevertheless, she did dishes."

08:05.269 --> 08:06.943
Uh, I think you're
being a little

08:06.949 --> 08:08.149
- hard on yourself.
- Mmm.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.582
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

08:09.588 --> 08:14.105
She picked you. Mae is
doing her essay on you.

08:14.111 --> 08:15.433
Really?

08:15.692 --> 08:18.794
- Wow, I don't even like Mae.
- Ditto.

08:19.309 --> 08:21.928
I'm just kidding. She's
wonderfully acerbic.

08:21.934 --> 08:23.781
I mean, could they
be less grateful?

08:23.787 --> 08:26.914
Come on. All kids are rotten.
You know that. Especially girls.

08:26.920 --> 08:28.905
Besides, Mae is wrong about you.

08:28.998 --> 08:31.440
As I recall, you had a
great deal of gumption.

08:31.446 --> 08:33.246
- Gumption, yeah!
- Sure.

08:33.253 --> 08:36.520
- You were early to join the workforce.
- Uh-huh. You in high school.

08:36.525 --> 08:39.135
Didn't you work in
that mailbox store?

08:39.650 --> 08:41.385
It was a FedEx Kinkos.

08:41.453 --> 08:43.883
And I'm the only employee
who survived the merger.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.433
There you go!

08:45.439 --> 08:47.315
Well, my daughter
doesn't look up to me.

08:47.394 --> 08:51.167
In fact, she looks down on me.
Why? Because I take care of her.

08:51.173 --> 08:54.011
So, tonight, I'm gonna
teach her a lesson.

08:56.473 --> 08:57.912
- Big date alert!
- _

08:57.918 --> 09:00.520
My buddy's getting laid
tonight. First time in two years.

09:00.526 --> 09:01.912
- Hot damn.
- Hey.

09:01.918 --> 09:03.483
Can you not tell people that?

09:03.489 --> 09:06.394
Come on, man. Don't worry.
It's a cone of silence in here.

09:06.707 --> 09:09.300
So, what did Lena say about
you going out with Lisa Apple?

09:09.810 --> 09:11.107
I didn't tell her.

09:11.113 --> 09:13.085
Martin, you and Lena are
in a good place right now.

09:13.091 --> 09:14.723
- What are you...
- She didn't tell me who she was dating.

09:14.729 --> 09:16.800
Lena has history
with this woman.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.203
She finds out that you're
doing stuff behind her back,

09:19.503 --> 09:20.703
there will be blood.

09:20.709 --> 09:23.391
Full disclosure is the key
to all healthy relationships.

09:23.397 --> 09:25.626
- Yeah.
- What do you think, A-town?

09:26.097 --> 09:28.410
- Let me run it by Camille. Mmm.
- You got it.

09:28.528 --> 09:31.738
And that is how it's done.

09:33.800 --> 09:36.511
Hey, baby. Cy's gonna send
you a photo of my new haircut.

09:36.517 --> 09:37.717
Approve please.

09:40.720 --> 09:41.986
Hey, gang.

09:41.992 --> 09:44.292
So, I'm out.

09:44.394 --> 09:46.027
- What?
- I'm out.

09:46.225 --> 09:47.891
I feel like too
much of my identity

09:47.897 --> 09:49.545
is wrapped in being a mom,

09:49.551 --> 09:51.374
so I'm gon' go get turnt.

09:52.447 --> 09:53.647
That's hilarious.

09:53.653 --> 09:55.059
Mae, how do I look?

09:55.065 --> 09:57.764
Like someone who wants to
regarded as a sexual object

09:57.770 --> 09:59.356
rather than a
three-dimensional person.

09:59.362 --> 10:03.449
Oh, you are so second
wave sometimes, Mae.

10:03.632 --> 10:06.843
Hey. What about my bake
sale tomorrow? Brondies?

10:06.849 --> 10:09.140
The recipe and ingredients
are on the kitchen counter.

10:09.146 --> 10:11.443
You're 14 and almost 16.

10:11.449 --> 10:13.116
I had a job when I was your age.

10:13.122 --> 10:15.917
So, I heard. She worked
in a mailbox store.

10:15.923 --> 10:18.620
Hey! It was a FedEx Kinkos.

10:19.095 --> 10:21.416
And I survived the merger!

10:24.730 --> 10:26.001
So, where we going tonight?

10:26.007 --> 10:28.434
Actually I just need you to drive
around the block for like an hour

10:28.440 --> 10:30.167
so that my kids think
I'm out on the town.

10:30.173 --> 10:33.461
Hey... what? You-you-you all
dressed up to not go out on the town?

10:33.467 --> 10:35.158
What's up with that?

10:35.164 --> 10:37.355
My daughter thinks
I'm a bad role model.

10:37.361 --> 10:39.371
Look, you need to stop
worrying about Little Mama

10:39.377 --> 10:41.800
- and start worrying about Big Mama.
- Big Mama?

10:41.806 --> 10:44.377
Look, you looking all good.
You better go and hit that club.

10:44.383 --> 10:46.198
And I ain't talking
about no Sam's.

10:46.204 --> 10:48.573
- Are you talking about...
- The club club.

10:48.689 --> 10:50.292
The clurb.

10:50.970 --> 10:53.993
Huh. The clurb.

10:55.466 --> 10:57.807
Yeah, I don't think
Big Mama can do that.

10:59.883 --> 11:01.400
Can Big Mama?

11:03.699 --> 11:05.919
It's getting kinda dark.
Why's it getting so dark?

11:05.925 --> 11:08.316
Because that's what happens
when the sun goes down.

11:08.322 --> 11:11.107
Why is nobody taking care of me?

11:11.524 --> 11:12.724
Who's there?

11:13.706 --> 11:16.501
What was that? Milo, stop
rolling around for a second.

11:17.689 --> 11:19.721
Milo isn't here.

11:20.813 --> 11:22.027
Tell me you heard that.

11:22.033 --> 11:26.778
Okay. Since I am the oldest and
least stupid, everyone follow me.

11:27.183 --> 11:29.191
- Where we going?
- Somewhere safe.

11:31.866 --> 11:33.066
Everybody in.

11:33.893 --> 11:36.214
This will be our panic
room till Mom gets home.

11:37.351 --> 11:39.955
Good call. If we get hungry,
we can eat Mom's insoles.

11:39.961 --> 11:43.438
And if we get bored, we can
journey into the dark web.

- Hello?

12:52.725 --> 12:54.811
- Can you hear me?
- Yes.

12:55.011 --> 12:57.518
I drank too much
and it's your fault.

12:58.014 --> 12:59.309
My fault?

12:59.517 --> 13:01.425
Because you were rude to me!

13:02.351 --> 13:04.243
- What? I...
- Yes, you were!

13:04.329 --> 13:06.936
Tell me the truth. Do you
want to break up with me?

13:07.233 --> 13:08.433
Do you?

13:08.639 --> 13:10.374
Hold on a sec.

13:14.432 --> 13:15.632
Oh, God.

13:21.341 --> 13:23.851
Hold on, honey. Come on.
Hold on. I'm coming in.

13:26.936 --> 13:28.522
Hey.

13:29.036 --> 13:30.236
Hi.

13:30.616 --> 13:31.816
Oh, God.

13:32.842 --> 13:34.127
Hi.

13:34.255 --> 13:37.642
Hi. Okay.

13:38.336 --> 13:39.947
Ooh, wow.

13:39.953 --> 13:42.541
How are you this drunk at 6:45?

13:42.547 --> 13:44.838
I don't think he loves me.

13:44.844 --> 13:47.286
Oh, oh, it's okay.

13:47.292 --> 13:49.864
No, it isn't! I love him.

13:49.870 --> 13:51.683
Like, I'm in love with him.

13:51.886 --> 13:54.005
- I need his kisses.
- No, you don't.

13:54.011 --> 13:56.384
- And I need kisses.
- No, you don't.

13:56.390 --> 13:58.384
- I need kisses.
- Stop. Stop saying "kisses".

13:58.600 --> 13:59.899
I need kisses.

13:59.905 --> 14:03.477
Listen. What you need is
a wet wipe, some Advil,

14:03.483 --> 14:05.275
and a travel-sized
bottle of mouthwash.

14:05.281 --> 14:07.865
Oh, my God. That
purse is everything.

14:08.017 --> 14:09.410
- It's magical.
- Okay.

14:09.416 --> 14:10.791
You're magical.

14:11.275 --> 14:14.986
You are. Yeah, and it's time
that you embrace that, okay?

14:15.360 --> 14:19.389
If we are gonna give away
the best parts of ourselves,

14:19.395 --> 14:22.604
then it better to
someone who deserves it.

14:23.014 --> 14:25.399
Alright? Because you're great.

14:25.494 --> 14:26.727
I'm great.

14:26.733 --> 14:27.933
Here.

14:29.393 --> 14:31.393
You have a little
ranch on your dress.

14:32.007 --> 14:33.424
God, I hope it's ranch.

14:35.764 --> 14:37.774
I bet you'd be a
really great mom.

14:39.181 --> 14:40.456
You know what?

14:41.156 --> 14:42.938
I am a great mom.

14:46.951 --> 14:49.836
Oh, come... You're
going to be okay.

14:50.054 --> 14:54.570
Things are going to be
okay. They are, you know?

14:56.546 --> 14:57.746
Hello?

15:00.081 --> 15:01.379
Oh, my God.

15:06.487 --> 15:09.415
- Did you hear that? Did you hear that, Mae?
- Yes, I did.

15:09.421 --> 15:11.818
- Stranger danger!
- Please don't kill us!

15:15.131 --> 15:16.742
How did you know
we were in here?

15:16.748 --> 15:18.177
Milo texted me.

15:18.271 --> 15:20.646
Are you here to help
me with my homework?

15:23.403 --> 15:24.603
Um...

15:26.692 --> 15:29.608
Okay, so, what happened to Mom?

15:29.949 --> 15:32.871
- She just went AWOL.
- She didn't go AWOL!

15:32.877 --> 15:35.641
Why are you yelling? You don't
even know what "AWOL" means.

15:36.543 --> 15:38.269
I'd like to believe
our mother has embarked

15:38.275 --> 15:40.646
on a spiritual journey
to discover who she is

15:40.652 --> 15:43.514
outside of the label she
uses to define herself.

15:43.520 --> 15:47.014
- On the eve of my bake sale.
- Okay, stop talking, all of you.

15:47.121 --> 15:48.396
I hope you little rats know

15:48.402 --> 15:50.004
that the only reason
anything ever good happens

15:50.010 --> 15:52.120
in this house is
because of your mother.

15:52.126 --> 15:54.013
Every birthday, every Christmas.

15:54.019 --> 15:56.264
If it were up to me,
you would all live unfed

15:56.270 --> 15:58.288
and unclothed in the yard.

15:58.761 --> 16:00.873
- Now do your homework.
- I did my homework.

16:00.879 --> 16:02.576
Can you make dinner?

16:03.466 --> 16:05.159
Hey, don't ask her.

16:05.165 --> 16:07.406
She's not here for
you. She's here for me.

16:07.600 --> 16:08.800
Gross.

16:11.229 --> 16:12.616
I will make dinner.

16:13.103 --> 16:15.591
Hey, can you also make
brondies for my bake sale?

16:15.893 --> 16:17.905
- Brondies?
- Yeah.

16:17.911 --> 16:19.111
Martin.

16:21.370 --> 16:24.154
Bake sale? This is
going to be a disaster.

16:24.160 --> 16:26.762
The only baking I do is
directly after waking.

16:27.144 --> 16:28.549
I'm not a baker.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.550
Lucky for you,
this little lady is.

16:30.556 --> 16:32.592
- You?
- No, not me. Her.

16:32.598 --> 16:35.220
Grandma Flour's Bakery
is only 1.3 miles away.

16:35.226 --> 16:37.701
They have 160 five-star reviews

16:37.707 --> 16:40.421
and their specialty is brownies.

16:40.724 --> 16:43.210
I don't know. Lena
always bakes from scratch.

16:43.216 --> 16:44.938
Why make things harder
than they have to be?

16:47.318 --> 16:50.505
"Why make things harder
than they have to be?"

16:51.509 --> 16:53.812
Kids, I'm going 1.3 miles.

16:53.818 --> 16:56.119
- You guys going to be okay for a minute?
- We'll be fine.

16:56.125 --> 16:57.522
Uh, keys.

16:57.623 --> 16:58.913
Oh, there.

17:02.827 --> 17:05.395
I wanna kiss you right now, but
I can't 'cause of these kids.

17:11.093 --> 17:12.468
You're so funny.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.684
Oh, hello.

17:14.766 --> 17:16.009
Hi, Lena.

17:16.015 --> 17:18.092
- Lisa Apple's here.
- Dad invited her.

17:18.098 --> 17:19.621
Oh!

17:19.921 --> 17:22.955
Lisa, Lisa. And the Cult Jam.

17:23.829 --> 17:26.034
You're looking very
scholarly tonight.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.402
Uh, I didn't realize
that Martin had

17:29.408 --> 17:32.293
hired you to help with the
kids, so what do we owe you?

17:39.702 --> 17:43.607
What'd we say... we said $13?

17:43.613 --> 17:45.613
- Yep. Okay.
- One, two, $12.

17:45.619 --> 17:46.870
It was $12.

17:48.859 --> 17:50.340
Lena, where the hell were you?

17:50.346 --> 17:52.670
I was trying to
teach Mae a lesson.

17:52.676 --> 17:54.943
And I do think those kids are
ready for more responsibility.

17:54.949 --> 17:56.347
I mean, when I
was their age, I...

17:56.353 --> 17:58.530
#SurvivedTheMerger.

17:58.536 --> 17:59.837
We know.

18:00.141 --> 18:02.936
But I agree, those kids should
be fending for themselves.

18:03.434 --> 18:05.762
And I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about Lisa Apple.

18:05.768 --> 18:08.342
I just... I didn't want you
to know that Lisa was a thing

18:08.348 --> 18:09.826
until I knew that
Lisa was a thing.

18:09.832 --> 18:12.321
And I certainly didn't want to
bring her around the kids that early.

18:12.327 --> 18:14.559
It's okay. It's Lisa Apple.

18:14.934 --> 18:17.626
You get to be with
someone young and fun.

18:17.632 --> 18:20.626
And I get to find out why she
wears those ridiculous glasses.

18:20.632 --> 18:23.066
I'm really glad that we
can have this conversation

18:23.272 --> 18:25.179
- without fighting.
- Me, too.

18:25.566 --> 18:27.879
- We're good.
- We are good.

18:28.262 --> 18:30.775
Okay, well, we're gonna...
we're gonna get going.

18:30.781 --> 18:34.601
We? Oh, Lisa Apple and you.

18:34.919 --> 18:36.119
Right.

18:42.837 --> 18:44.098
Mom?

18:44.562 --> 18:45.762
Mae?

18:46.813 --> 18:49.262
- You okay?
- No.

18:53.873 --> 18:57.459
I'm a bad feminist
and daughter, too.

18:57.658 --> 19:00.695
What? Why would you say that?

19:01.393 --> 19:03.003
I mom-shamed you,

19:03.296 --> 19:06.104
which isn't at all in the
spirit of the movement.

19:06.110 --> 19:08.424
Oh, it's okay, sweetie.

19:08.979 --> 19:10.908
No, it isn't.

19:10.914 --> 19:13.309
And although I want you to

19:13.315 --> 19:16.174
break free of the domestic
chains that bind you...

19:16.180 --> 19:17.880
Nothing is binding me.

19:18.076 --> 19:21.406
No one is binding me, okay?

19:21.692 --> 19:23.891
I chose to do things this way.

19:23.897 --> 19:27.391
Work part-time so that I
can be home with you kids.

19:27.694 --> 19:29.895
And I think I'm doing
a pretty good job

19:29.901 --> 19:32.092
because look at how
cool you turned out.

19:32.098 --> 19:35.086
I know an entire cheerleading
squad that would beg to differ.

19:35.092 --> 19:37.124
Who cares about the
cheerleading squad?

19:37.262 --> 19:40.171
It's the band geeks who are
going to be running the world.

19:40.365 --> 19:42.062
The band geeks hate me, too.

19:42.969 --> 19:46.163
Sorry I acted like being
a mom wasn't important.

19:46.571 --> 19:49.423
I really didn't like how it felt
when you weren't home tonight.

19:51.710 --> 19:55.032
Because, nevertheless...

19:55.313 --> 19:57.247
she makes everyone feel safe.

20:00.520 --> 20:03.622
Wait, why would the
band geeks hate you?

20:04.510 --> 20:07.054
I licked the clarinet
player's reed.

20:09.000 --> 20:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

20:16.222 --> 20:18.527
- Wow.
- Yeah.

20:19.510 --> 20:21.277
Well, that was worth
more than 12 bucks.

20:21.396 --> 20:25.365
- Gee, thanks.
- No, I'm serious. You could go pro.

20:25.678 --> 20:28.069
