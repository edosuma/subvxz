05:04.680 --> 05:06.671
And it has been made
very clear to me

05:06.765 --> 05:08.266

Trust me, it was
not an easy thing

05:21.155 --> 05:22.816

past flirtations.

05:25.576 --> 05:26.907

that you made?

of our contact.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.073
We had a deal.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.366
Are you serious?

15:53.870 --> 15:55.030
As a heart attack.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.741
Not only did you sign
an anti-compete Clause

15:57.833 --> 16:01.121
but 49% of
every scrap of genius

16:01.211 --> 16:04.248
that comes out
of your little noggin
belongs to me.

16:04.714 --> 16:07.456
And don't forget,
I happen to know
how things turn out

16:07.551 --> 16:09.212
and just to be Clear,

16:09.302 --> 16:13.011
the name SadTeCh
is the winner
of this horserace,

16:13.265 --> 16:15.347
and right now that is
the card I'm holding.

16:15.433 --> 16:16.468
You mother...

16:16.560 --> 16:18.767
Name calling is
not going to make
this any easier.

16:19.604 --> 16:20.719
You've been served.

16:21.690 --> 16:22.896
I'll see you in court.

16:27.154 --> 16:29.190
Is that your stray?
Mr. John Doe?

16:31.575 --> 16:32.655
Yeah.

16:33.368 --> 16:36.155
Social services
is backed up,
and you know what?

16:36.246 --> 16:37.326
Let it go, Carlos.

16:37.414 --> 16:39.370
No, it's cute.
Get kittens too?

16:40.250 --> 16:41.365
What'd they get?

16:41.918 --> 16:44.204
An active
camouflage system.

16:44.296 --> 16:47.754
It bends the light around
an object to make it...

16:47.924 --> 16:48.959
Invisible.

16:49.050 --> 16:50.085
DILLON: This makes
my head hurt.

16:50.302 --> 16:51.508
You ever heard of
anything like this?

16:52.387 --> 16:54.218
Uh, once or twice, yeah.

16:54.973 --> 16:58.215
Three very high-tech
robberies in as many weeks.

16:58.518 --> 16:59.678
One is an anomaly.

16:59.769 --> 17:01.930
Two is a coincidence.
Three, we're
talking pattern.

17:02.105 --> 17:04.016
The thief was familiar
with the office.

17:04.107 --> 17:07.440
He knew the alarm
system and the security
camera coverage.

17:07.527 --> 17:11.486
He used advanced jamming
tech to disable the CCTVs

17:11.573 --> 17:13.655
and just to add
insult to injury,

17:13.742 --> 17:15.027
while the heist
was going down,

17:15.118 --> 17:16.858
someone hacked
into the servers,

17:16.953 --> 17:19.945
and grabbed
all their proprietary
engineering specs.

17:20.207 --> 17:21.367
Sounds like an inside job.

17:21.458 --> 17:22.493
Company swears no.

17:23.460 --> 17:25.496
They vet their people
tighter than the NSA.

17:26.129 --> 17:27.335
Everyone has been
accounted for.

17:27.422 --> 17:28.502
All right.

17:28.590 --> 17:30.876
Who do we know in the
advanced technology game?

17:33.511 --> 17:34.842
You have to wear
that ugly-ass patch?

17:35.347 --> 17:36.712
That's your
father's legacy.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.929
Look, that's his
contribution to HALO.

17:39.226 --> 17:42.218
Besides, we need it to tap
into the synaptic system.

17:42.312 --> 17:43.347
Nobody's going to
want to slap

17:43.438 --> 17:44.473
a piece of plastic
on their head.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.804
It needs to be
just the bracelet.

17:46.024 --> 17:47.230
Uh...

17:48.818 --> 17:50.524
Well, maybe our graphing
conductivity can be improved.

17:50.654 --> 17:52.360
No,no,no,no.
VVetnedthat

17:52.447 --> 17:54.108
Itjust melted
all over the table.

17:54.199 --> 17:55.530
Ugh! Itwas bad.

17:56.117 --> 17:57.493
Anyone else?
Anything?

17:59.329 --> 18:00.489
Where's Ericsson?

18:01.081 --> 18:02.366
Williams? Zamir?

18:02.457 --> 18:03.492
Poof

18:03.667 --> 18:04.656
The midnight raid.

18:05.126 --> 18:06.161
Wait, what?

18:06.836 --> 18:09.748
It was very sad.
SadTeCh kind of.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.250
They left to work
for SadTeCh?

18:12.467 --> 18:14.003
Yeah. Sorry.

18:14.552 --> 18:15.678
Thatsnake!

18:20.350 --> 18:21.510
Was anyone going to
tell me about this?

18:21.601 --> 18:23.592
You mean,
like how I found out
you're being sued,

18:23.687 --> 18:24.972
by Matthew Kellog
and SadTeCh?

18:25.063 --> 18:26.178
That's just Kellog
rattling my Chain.

18:26.314 --> 18:28.396
No, Alec,
it is not.
I'm doing my best.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.943
Not when you let
your head counsel
get blindsided,

18:31.027 --> 18:32.312
by a lawsuit like this.

18:32.404 --> 18:33.564
He has a Claim.

18:33.905 --> 18:35.645
You did sign
a non-compete.

18:35.740 --> 18:38.231
If this goes to court
we will likely lose.

18:38.660 --> 18:39.775
Add that to a restive board.

18:39.869 --> 18:41.780
They gave me two months.
I'm trying to fix HALO.

18:41.871 --> 18:44.123
Money and patience tick
away at the same rate.

18:44.207 --> 18:47.370
The stock price wobbles
and the boy genius
CEO headlines

18:47.502 --> 18:48.662
all but disappear.

18:49.421 --> 18:52.037
The problem is
no one really
understands your vision.

18:52.215 --> 18:53.455
Oh, ldo.

18:54.384 --> 18:55.999
Figure out a way
to get rid of this lawsuit.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.504
Buy me time to fix this.

18:58.388 --> 18:59.343
I'll try my best.

18:59.431 --> 19:00.466
Thanks.

19:03.059 --> 19:04.265
Our code doesn't stand up.

19:04.352 --> 19:05.853
The prototypes
are running too hot.

19:06.187 --> 19:07.723
I'm fighting the deadline
of my life here.

19:08.231 --> 19:10.313
Can I do this?
Yes. Yes.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.389
Listen.

19:12.402 --> 19:14.688
There are two or three things
that you need for HALO,

19:14.988 --> 19:17.070
they'll be widely
available in... (MUTTERS)

19:17.407 --> 19:19.739
Ten, maybe nine years.

19:31.629 --> 19:33.415
(EXHALES)
This is so frustrating.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.289
Except for the
high-tech connection,

19:35.383 --> 19:36.919
none of these robberies
show a pattern.

19:37.427 --> 19:41.761
And they superficially
look like inside jobs
but they can't be.

19:42.307 --> 19:43.387
I need a favor.

19:43.892 --> 19:46.224
The care facility misplaced
John Doe's effects.

19:46.311 --> 19:49.018
They dropped them off
here and I found this.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.312
I've ID'd the hotel.

19:51.566 --> 19:54.273
They have a long-term
resident who paid
three months in advance.

19:55.653 --> 19:57.780
Will you cover for me
while I go Check it out
with him?

19:58.531 --> 19:59.862
What is it with this guy?

20:02.619 --> 20:03.608
I don't know.

20:05.246 --> 20:06.531
But something.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.497
I'll be quick. Please?

20:09.584 --> 20:10.664
You owe me one.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.079
Thanks.

20:32.607 --> 20:33.847
Ring any bells?

20:34.651 --> 20:35.811
No.

20:37.028 --> 20:38.234
No, sorry.

20:39.823 --> 20:42.986
Clearly I'm not riCh
and I have low standards.

20:43.535 --> 20:44.866
That's very
disappointing.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.155
Do you read a lot
of science fiction?

20:47.497 --> 20:48.486
What?

20:48.581 --> 20:49.661
The book.

20:56.756 --> 20:57.791
I don't know.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.332
You getting as tired
of that answer as I am?

21:02.345 --> 21:03.585
You could say that.

21:04.722 --> 21:06.132
So, Cheap and stupid.

21:07.725 --> 21:09.681
Guess I'll have to
get by on my looks.

21:11.938 --> 21:13.474
Like you don't know
what I'm talking about.

21:20.321 --> 21:21.697
What's that
on your wrist?

21:23.950 --> 21:25.030
It's faded ink.

21:25.535 --> 21:26.866
And of course
I don't know
what it means.

21:27.036 --> 21:28.162
But you did.

21:29.205 --> 21:30.536
At one point.

21:34.169 --> 21:35.705
It could be
GPS coordinates.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.210
If the location
is Close to here,

21:38.339 --> 21:40.796
we could stop by and see
if itjogs your memory.

21:41.092 --> 21:42.207
Okay.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.304
And if that
doesn't work,

21:46.264 --> 21:47.879
what's next,
Kiera Cameron?

21:49.809 --> 21:52.926
Then I think
I've gone as far
with you as I can go.

21:54.063 --> 21:55.269
I'm sorry.

21:56.524 --> 21:58.264
Well, then let's go
jog my memory.

22:27.555 --> 22:28.761
This is it.

22:30.767 --> 22:31.756
Well?

22:33.770 --> 22:35.055
I don't know, maybe.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.684
Look, I'm sorry.
If I had even a hint,

22:38.775 --> 22:39.764
I would...
You know what?

22:39.859 --> 22:41.724
I don't have
time for maybe.

22:42.195 --> 22:43.935
I'm sorry that
what happened
to you happened.

22:44.155 --> 22:46.362
I'm sorry that
my name is bouncing
around in your head.

22:46.449 --> 22:47.484
I really am.

22:47.575 --> 22:48.690
It's all right. I get it.

22:48.785 --> 22:49.945
You think I'm crazy.

22:50.245 --> 22:51.405
Ithink I'm crazy.

22:52.455 --> 22:53.956
This all feels
like a dream.

22:54.374 --> 22:55.705
My real life
is just these images.

22:55.792 --> 22:57.999
These crazy images
flashing around in my head.

22:58.336 --> 23:01.624
I get these flashes of faces
that I think I should know,

23:01.714 --> 23:03.545
and I know I know them.
Ijust don't know how.

23:03.633 --> 23:04.668
I don't know how.

23:04.759 --> 23:06.124
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

23:07.178 --> 23:08.167
Carlos?

23:08.805 --> 23:10.420
Yeah, Piron just
got hit by our thief.

23:10.515 --> 23:11.800
Dillon's going to
blow a gasket.

23:12.308 --> 23:13.559
KIERA:
I'll meet you there.

23:16.980 --> 23:18.470
I really do have to go.

23:19.148 --> 23:20.399
I was here.

23:22.652 --> 23:23.812
What do you mean?

23:23.903 --> 23:25.143
This City.

23:25.238 --> 23:26.318
This same City.

23:29.659 --> 23:31.195
I was scrambling
with other people.

23:32.161 --> 23:34.368
Shelled out black
canyons with glass...

23:34.455 --> 23:35.831
Concrete...

23:39.669 --> 23:41.000
This is going
to sound crazy.

23:41.087 --> 23:45.296
It's like I'm not
of this place.

23:47.135 --> 23:49.842
It's like I am not
of this time.

23:57.812 --> 23:58.801
Are you okay?

24:01.357 --> 24:03.473
I suppose ifwhat they
took actually worked,

24:03.776 --> 24:04.982
then I'd be angry.

24:06.279 --> 24:08.861
Maybe whoever robbed me
can figure out how to fix it.

24:09.866 --> 24:12.323
Do you have any idea
who could be behind
these robberies?

24:12.535 --> 24:13.650
No.

24:14.078 --> 24:16.455
Is there anyone
you suspect might
be an enemy?

24:19.542 --> 24:21.703
You never know
who your enemies are
going to be in my position.

24:25.089 --> 24:27.421
You do all your research
and development in-house?

24:28.676 --> 24:29.711
What are
you getting at?

24:29.886 --> 24:31.968
A lot of
tech companies farm out
the various components

24:32.055 --> 24:33.044
of whatever it is
they're building.

24:33.139 --> 24:34.345
I figured HALO
might be the same.

24:34.432 --> 24:35.638
Yeah, sure
we do the same.

24:35.725 --> 24:37.716
A surface tech
company from Korea.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.186
Batteries from Norway.

24:39.854 --> 24:41.469
The skin patch was actually
developed right here in town.

24:41.564 --> 24:42.599
WCIT.

24:42.690 --> 24:45.181
WCIT Alpha Labs developed
the invisibility Cloak,

24:45.276 --> 24:46.391
before it went commercial.

24:47.403 --> 24:48.734
We need to
look into that.

24:50.198 --> 24:51.529
Thank you, Alec.

24:52.241 --> 24:53.321
What are friends for?

25:07.090 --> 25:10.082
You think there's
something to this
WCIT Alpha Labs link?

25:10.343 --> 25:12.834
(SIGHS)
Well, Bibby went to WCIT.

25:12.929 --> 25:16.717
Figured maybe there would
be a connection to Betty,
a lead, something.

25:18.142 --> 25:19.598
It was a long shot.
It was stupid.

25:20.061 --> 25:21.392
No, not at all.

25:22.689 --> 25:25.726
Have you, um,
noticed Alec's
aﬂﬂude?

25:27.443 --> 25:29.900
He seems a little more
arrogant than usual.

25:31.906 --> 25:34.864
Yeah, well, he said he was
under a lot of pressure.

25:35.368 --> 25:36.403
Business going south.

25:37.745 --> 25:39.827
Maybe he's looking
for a shortcut to
corporate riches.

25:40.498 --> 25:42.034
He said he was looking
for a competitive edge...

25:42.125 --> 25:43.114
His words.

25:44.794 --> 25:47.376
Are you suggesting
Alec staged
the Piron robberies

25:47.463 --> 25:48.623
to avoid suspicion?

25:55.221 --> 25:56.381
You're not coming?

25:57.849 --> 25:59.760
I've got something
to Check out.

25:59.851 --> 26:01.512
It's Close by.
I'll walk.

26:01.769 --> 26:02.975
I got your back.

26:09.986 --> 26:11.101
You're leaving?

26:12.405 --> 26:13.815
No money,
no room.

26:15.199 --> 26:17.656
You are one sad case.
I know, right?

26:18.411 --> 26:19.742
Irresistible.

26:23.791 --> 26:25.452
I want to talk about
what you said.

26:27.837 --> 26:30.374
Kiera Cameron,
I promise you,
I am not crazy.

26:31.299 --> 26:33.961
Well, you rented
this place
for three months.

26:35.845 --> 26:37.585
You're right.
Bananas.

26:39.182 --> 26:41.047
First girl I meet
she sees
right through me.

26:42.185 --> 26:43.516
That's the thing.

26:43.978 --> 26:45.343
I do see
right through you.

26:45.980 --> 26:47.516
You don't have
any health records.

26:48.149 --> 26:50.515
You're not
in any database.

26:51.277 --> 26:52.357
You're invisible.

26:53.571 --> 26:57.189
You know how you
said the Cityjust
didn't feel right?

26:59.368 --> 27:00.619
I felt that way, too.

27:01.162 --> 27:03.699
Well, maybe
youTeinsane.

27:04.123 --> 27:05.738
Maybe
I'm from the future.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.040
Oh, well,
now you're just trying
to make me feel better.

27:13.049 --> 27:14.710
I do appreciate
the gesture.

27:15.718 --> 27:19.051
I arrived here
unexpectedly.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.471
Everything I knew,

27:23.267 --> 27:25.303
everything I loved
was gone.

27:26.813 --> 27:29.976
But I found someone
who helped me
get through it.

27:31.901 --> 27:32.890
Ah.

27:33.528 --> 27:34.813
A friend.

27:35.738 --> 27:37.274
Someone who
became a friend.

27:40.409 --> 27:41.740
So there's
hope for me?

27:44.497 --> 27:45.486
(CHUCKLES)

27:46.624 --> 27:50.162
I... I don't know
why I trust you.

27:51.295 --> 27:52.910
But for some
reason I do.

27:58.928 --> 28:00.088
I have a couch.

28:00.888 --> 28:02.128
You are welcome to it.

28:02.557 --> 28:04.593
For a few days.
Three days max.

28:05.059 --> 28:07.675
Well, I barely
know you.

28:08.688 --> 28:10.679
Well, ifyou have
a better offer.

28:10.773 --> 28:12.229
No, no. I'mjust
messing around.

28:12.316 --> 28:14.398
Iwould... Yeah.

28:15.111 --> 28:17.022
It's fine.
Kiera Cameron,
that's a deal.

28:18.614 --> 28:20.821
Why do you keep saying
my whole name like that?

28:21.742 --> 28:23.448
Keep hoping it will
trigger something.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.944
And if it does,
you'll be the second to know.

28:32.712 --> 28:36.455
DILLON: Let the record
show this interview with
Alec Sadler is voluntary.

28:38.259 --> 28:39.669
AleC, lwant to
thank you for coming in,

28:39.760 --> 28:41.261
and shedding light
on this for us.

28:41.429 --> 28:42.919
Of course
I'm here voluntarily.

28:43.139 --> 28:44.675
I have nothing to hide
and the idea that

28:44.765 --> 28:47.142
I staged a robbery
at Piron to avoid suspicion

28:47.226 --> 28:48.511
is complete fantasy.

28:50.855 --> 28:52.095
So, no Kiera, huh?

28:53.733 --> 28:54.893
Just as well.

28:55.484 --> 28:57.975
Look, guys, can wejust
skip to the end here?
I've read the file.

28:59.447 --> 29:02.063
Under the terms
of the Piron agreement,

29:02.158 --> 29:03.614
Alec has complete access.

29:05.036 --> 29:06.367
ALEC:
Look, all this technology,

29:06.454 --> 29:09.161
the active camo,
which is wicked
by the way,

29:09.248 --> 29:10.988
is all military
or paramilitary teCh.

29:11.292 --> 29:12.498
Well, what about HALO?

29:13.753 --> 29:15.118
Sure. I guess.

29:16.005 --> 29:17.290
But Jack can attest
to the fact that

29:17.381 --> 29:19.337
we're moving Piron
away from military teCh.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.172
I want to help people.

29:21.886 --> 29:23.001
Ask yourself.

29:23.387 --> 29:24.672
Who could use this?

29:25.097 --> 29:26.837
Who would want to deploy
this stuff in the field?

29:27.016 --> 29:28.426
Liber8.
Exactly.

29:30.144 --> 29:31.179
One more thing.

29:32.063 --> 29:34.145
This whole
inside man theory?

29:34.231 --> 29:35.732
We discredited that.

29:35.816 --> 29:37.352
The evidence
doesn't match up.

29:37.693 --> 29:38.728
It does.

29:39.028 --> 29:40.188
If it's not a man.

29:43.032 --> 29:45.023
We're talking
high-tech companies.

29:45.368 --> 29:47.029
Next level security.
Real tight.

29:47.828 --> 29:49.113
But what else
do they like?

29:49.622 --> 29:52.159
Toys. Smart appliances.

29:52.667 --> 29:53.952
Thermostats.
Refrigerators.

29:54.043 --> 29:55.374
Routers. Smart TVs.

29:55.628 --> 29:57.619
All Wi-Fi enabled
and imminently hackable.

29:57.713 --> 30:00.295
Just like whoever pulled
the Fermitas attacks.

30:00.967 --> 30:03.049
They're listening
all the time.

30:04.887 --> 30:06.878
Think about that next time
you leave your computer on.

30:20.486 --> 30:21.646

31:03.779 --> 31:04.894
Hello, Carlos.

31:05.448 --> 31:06.608
Lucas?

31:06.949 --> 31:07.984
Mmm-hmm.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.071
You behind
these robberies?

31:11.162 --> 31:12.151
Nope.

31:12.621 --> 31:14.282
But / can point you
in the direction of who is.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.406
Yeah, why don't you do that?

31:17.168 --> 31:18.453
And then tell me
what you want.

31:18.711 --> 31:19.791
(CHUCKLES)

31:19.879 --> 31:20.914
That's just it, Carlos.

31:21.130 --> 31:22.290
There's no quid pro quo.

31:22.381 --> 31:23.621
This one's a freebie.

31:25.134 --> 31:26.965
Yeah. Why should
/ trust you?

31:29.055 --> 31:30.795
Because we both
want Betty's killer
to go down.

31:32.725 --> 31:34.511
It’s worth taking
a chance on trusting me.

31:44.153 --> 31:45.233
I miss what
I left behind

31:45.321 --> 31:50.190
but somehow being here,
I'm truer to myself.

31:50.993 --> 31:53.075
It Clarified
what I believe.

31:53.662 --> 31:55.323
I wonder about
my other life.

31:56.457 --> 31:57.867
How it unfolds
without me.

31:59.210 --> 32:00.450
I do
the same thing.

Are you okay?

33:14.076 --> 33:15.577
How did you get here?

33:16.245 --> 33:18.486
I called your phone
and he answered.

33:18.581 --> 33:20.321
Told me what happened.
I got here as soon
as I could.

33:32.261 --> 33:33.421
Who attacked you?

33:35.222 --> 33:38.589
Somebody trying to finish
a job they'd already started.

33:38.976 --> 33:40.091
I don't understand.

33:43.731 --> 33:44.766

33:45.482 --> 33:47.018
It's not bothering
you anymore.

Yeah, I know.
I can't explain it.

33:54.617 --> 33:56.949

33:57.161 --> 33:58.992
Not uncommon in
military personnel.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.120
One day.

34:04.585 --> 34:05.791
Hey, you good to travel?

34:06.503 --> 34:07.629
Where to?

34:07.963 --> 34:09.169
Grey Point Security.

34:16.680 --> 34:18.181
Gotta say,

34:18.265 --> 34:20.051
it's actually
nice to be here
by invitation,

34:20.142 --> 34:21.177
for a Change.

34:21.977 --> 34:23.387
Let's cut to

34:23.854 --> 34:25.310
Ah, they
grow up so fast.

34:28.067 --> 34:29.807
You already know
why I asked you
to come here.

34:34.823 --> 34:36.779
You don't move
in straight lines Kellog.

34:37.034 --> 34:38.149
You never have.

34:38.702 --> 34:40.988
You say you want apples
when you want oranges.

34:41.580 --> 34:44.037
You Claim you want
to sue me and pretend
you want a pay day.

34:44.124 --> 34:45.500
I just want things
to be fair.

34:45.584 --> 34:46.664
No, you don't.

34:47.461 --> 34:48.621
No, you maneuver.

34:48.879 --> 34:50.289
You're maneuvering me.

34:52.341 --> 34:54.047
The question is,
will it work or not?

34:55.261 --> 34:56.842
I have no idea
what you mean.

34:58.514 --> 35:00.220
I've had
my representatives
tend you an offer

35:00.307 --> 35:01.342

35:02.643 --> 35:05.100
including your
exclusive services.

35:05.437 --> 35:06.426

35:10.859 --> 35:13.771
Well, that's one way
to get out of a lawsuit,
Isuppose.

35:14.196 --> 35:16.403
Don't pretend like this
wasn't your plan all along.

35:16.490 --> 35:17.570
Is that what I'm doing?

35:18.242 --> 35:19.527
Now you're just being rude.

35:20.953 --> 35:22.284
Better be an offer
I can't refuse.

35:22.579 --> 35:23.659
Don't tempt me.

35:24.498 --> 35:25.954
I want a seat
on the Board.

35:26.625 --> 35:27.740
And I only
report to you.

35:27.835 --> 35:30.247
As if anyone else
would want to hear
from you anyways.

35:39.638 --> 35:40.753
Fine.

35:44.393 --> 35:45.803
It's good doing
business with you.

36:03.454 --> 36:04.990
So Dillon
told you to leave
Betty's murder alone,

36:05.080 --> 36:07.332
and you want to search
Grey Point Security,

36:07.416 --> 36:09.873
without a warrant
on the advice of Liber8?

36:10.586 --> 36:12.372
What can I say?
I'm just in that
kind of mood.

36:14.256 --> 36:15.962
You've Chosen
sides, Carlos.

36:16.050 --> 36:17.540
Yeah, I Chose
Betty's side.

36:17.968 --> 36:19.754
Are you prepared
to cross that line?

36:22.931 --> 36:25.058
You're convinced Neelon's
working for Sonmanto.

36:25.768 --> 36:26.848
I'm just
following through.

36:27.895 --> 36:29.760
Okay. What's the plan?

36:30.356 --> 36:31.721
Betty said that Dillon
would do the right thing

36:31.815 --> 36:32.930
if the facts
were in front of him.

36:33.567 --> 36:34.852
I just need the facts.

that suit doesn't do?

37:13.315 --> 37:14.725
Holy shit.

37:18.112 --> 37:19.397
That's the precinct.

37:19.488 --> 37:21.024
They hacked the cameras
in the computers.

37:22.324 --> 37:24.189
Lucas said this would
connect us to Betty?

37:25.911 --> 37:27.276

37:28.122 --> 37:29.487

our amateur thief?

38:09.163 --> 38:11.529
Well, he's scared shitless
but he's cooperating.

38:12.583 --> 38:14.995
He says he can
prove someone from
Grey Point Security

38:15.085 --> 38:16.700
was behind
the Fermitas
gas attack.

38:17.045 --> 38:19.206
Well, he's smart.
Unlike this asshole.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.455
We swept
the precinct for bugs.

38:21.884 --> 38:23.465
We found just
the one transmitter,

38:23.552 --> 38:25.838

within a 30 foot radius.

38:27.473 --> 38:28.713

38:30.184 --> 38:32.220
I ran ballistics
on our friend's gun,

that killed Betty.
