WEBVTT

00:00.167 --> 00:01.501
Previously on Condor...

00:01.642 --> 00:04.048
He changed his mind, wants to help.
- Help how?

00:04.073 --> 00:06.859
He's going over the files.
He thinks Gordon's been set up.

00:06.884 --> 00:09.766
I have an asset inside the SVR

00:09.766 --> 00:11.336
A week ago he passed me a file

00:11.383 --> 00:14.509
indicating that Gordon Piper was
working with the Russians.

00:14.674 --> 00:17.508
I can't do this anymore.

00:17.626 --> 00:22.000
When you contact the CIA, you
must not say that I helped you.

00:22.167 --> 00:25.459
I need to ask you for
one last favour.

00:25.584 --> 00:29.059
I'm suggesting that the mole's
treachery is getting people killed...

00:29.094 --> 00:31.570
...and causing other damage in
ways we cannot begin to know.

00:31.595 --> 00:34.001
So as much as we may dislike
each other personally...

00:34.032 --> 00:36.001
I don't have a personal
opinion about you.

00:36.034 --> 00:38.604
So as much as I dislike
you personally,

00:38.604 --> 00:41.338
I showed you my report
in a spirit of openness

00:41.459 --> 00:43.490
This is the same photo from Bob's office.

00:43.490 --> 00:46.810
And you can plant fake files but how do
you make an innocent man take a payoff?

00:46.868 --> 00:49.806
Gordon took money from a
Russian intelligent agent.

00:49.806 --> 00:52.134
No more waiting
- I agree

00:52.159 --> 00:53.719
Can you do me a favour?

00:53.834 --> 00:55.584
The pizza's here.

00:55.751 --> 00:58.077
I asked them to let me be
the one to come and get you.

00:58.077 --> 00:59.559
Tracy, I don't know what
the fuck you're talking about.

00:59.584 --> 01:02.083
Lior Lishkott.
You took money from him.

01:02.250 --> 01:05.297
You are going to have
to go away for a while.

01:05.297 --> 01:07.564
How long do I
have to go away for?

01:11.157 --> 01:13.134
The ambulance ...!
- What ambulance?

01:13.159 --> 01:14.839
How'd they get it?

01:15.250 --> 01:17.459
Where'd you get the ambulance?
- Rented it.

01:17.592 --> 01:21.373
Your friend...the one who's alive
Is he going to tell anyone my name?

01:21.373 --> 01:23.106
He doesn't know your name.

02:20.959 --> 02:25.918
Hi. There's been a development
I thought you'd want to know about.

02:26.318 --> 02:29.375
Gordon's been picked up.
- Okay

02:29.501 --> 02:32.918
I'll come in with you.
- I'm out front.

02:46.918 --> 02:49.629
I feel terrible for
what I've done to him.

02:50.129 --> 02:53.059
You didn't do anything to him.
You defended him.

02:53.083 --> 02:54.810
That's what I keep telling myself.

02:54.810 --> 02:57.262
This is on Gordon.
You're not responsible

02:57.792 --> 03:01.776
I keep telling myself that, too.
And it was his decision so

03:01.834 --> 03:04.834
But I didn't try and help him.
I saw him getting worse.

03:05.414 --> 03:09.918
The drinking and the money problems
and the fights with Eva...

03:10.418 --> 03:14.316
He was hurting. I didn't reach out.
I did the opposite.

03:15.098 --> 03:18.974
You should have seen the way Eva looked
at me when I walked him out of the house

03:19.125 --> 03:23.709
Like she wanted to kill me.
His kids...

03:25.751 --> 03:29.918
If Gordon is innocent, we
will have a chance to prove it.

03:30.083 --> 03:34.584
Did he say anything?
- No. He's really isolated.

03:34.751 --> 03:39.292
Robin's gonna let him sit overnight
and question him in the morning.

03:40.501 --> 03:42.209
I still believe that
Gordon was set up.

03:46.334 --> 03:49.209
I don't know what
I believe any more.

03:50.417 --> 03:52.147
Anything on the ambulance?

03:52.147 --> 03:54.998
They were still setting up
a spreadsheet when I left.

03:55.209 --> 04:00.125
Okay. 'Til the morning...

04:42.918 --> 04:47.501
I've missed you, my friend.
I wish the circumstances were better.

04:47.667 --> 04:50.675
At least it looks as though
your people have taken the bait.

04:50.675 --> 04:52.355
They're not my people.

04:53.125 --> 04:56.078
There may still be a problem.
- Who?  - Joe Turner.

04:56.765 --> 04:59.187
He recognised the photo from
the file I planted in Partidge's office.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.109
He is smart.
- I'll handle it.

05:01.109 --> 05:03.750
No, if anything happened to
Turner it'll only bring more heat.

05:03.792 --> 05:05.980
I'm keeping him close.
He trusts me.

05:06.401 --> 05:08.187
If it needs to be done, I'll do it.

05:10.351 --> 05:14.359
There's another loose end to tie.
The guy we used for the Sirin job, Dan Letts...

05:14.374 --> 05:16.174
I don't think he
could ID me but...

05:16.459 --> 05:18.042
...why take the chance?

05:19.709 --> 05:22.357
Any word from Moscow on
how Sirin found out about me?

05:23.013 --> 05:26.450
We're investigating.
You're going to have to stay here.

05:26.528 --> 05:29.451
You've earned your retirement:
nice apartment in Moscow...

05:29.451 --> 05:32.351
dacha in the country,
money, whatever you want

05:34.068 --> 05:38.342
The timing's not good.
I've met someone.

05:39.501 --> 05:43.637
I'm thinking about getting out.
- Getting out?

05:44.250 --> 05:49.250
You could be seen as a liability.
- Is that a threat?

05:50.501 --> 05:52.834
Not by me.

05:53.070 --> 05:57.429
You think I'm gonna become a triple agent?
- The risk...

05:57.838 --> 06:00.026
I don't have any reason
to say anything to anybody...

06:00.026 --> 06:01.560
...and every reason not to.

06:01.584 --> 06:04.670
When we first met, you were
a man with thwarted ambitions...

06:04.670 --> 06:06.709
...and a burning desire
to do something great.

06:06.751 --> 06:10.459
That never goes away,
even if it goes dormant for a while.

06:13.083 --> 06:18.000
I'm not that man anymore.
I want a simple life now.

06:19.550 --> 06:21.159
Moscow may not allow it.

06:21.159 --> 06:23.690
Why does Moscow care where I retire?

06:23.834 --> 06:26.412
If you were in Moscow,
you could let the world know...

06:26.412 --> 06:29.268
...the extent of our
penetration into the CIA.

06:29.292 --> 06:31.347
That in itself is a
public relations coup.

06:31.347 --> 06:35.101
This isn't about Moscow. This is
about you, and you want the credit.

06:35.125 --> 06:36.709
I want us to get the credit.

06:36.876 --> 06:40.795
All that work... all those years...

06:40.795 --> 06:42.315
What were they for?

07:21.417 --> 07:25.501
Does he look okay?
What the fuck happened?

07:39.542 --> 07:43.918
Where the fuck are you?
I call and I call. Call me back!

07:44.083 --> 07:48.918
I'm really fucking scared. I think
someone's watching me.

07:50.584 --> 07:52.292
Damn...

08:13.417 --> 08:15.375
Would you like some dessert?

08:17.484 --> 08:20.792
If you have any heart medication,
now would be the time to take it.

08:28.292 --> 08:30.501
Do you have to get that?

08:34.125 --> 08:38.828
It's just my assistant.
She's checking up on me.

08:38.828 --> 08:41.039
I'll call her in the morning.

08:46.136 --> 08:49.046
So would you like to
see the rest of the house?

08:50.315 --> 08:53.049
I don't believe you've
been upstairs yet.

08:54.083 --> 08:56.667
I'd like that very much.

09:21.959 --> 09:25.209
Does that feel good?
- Oh, yeah...

09:32.792 --> 09:36.375
Are you expecting someone?
- No.

09:44.596 --> 09:47.658
Hi, Carla.
- Sorry to show up unannounced.

09:47.683 --> 09:48.998
I tried calling a few times

09:49.029 --> 09:50.025
What's wrong?

09:50.025 --> 09:52.349
I got a call from a
contact over at the FBI.

09:52.392 --> 09:56.408
Their embedded at CIMC has
taken one of our people into custody.

09:56.433 --> 09:57.433
Who?

09:57.440 --> 09:59.862
Gordon Piper.

10:30.740 --> 10:32.751
Oh, fucking hilarious!

10:38.083 --> 10:42.598
You think this is funny?
This shit could kill me!

10:43.626 --> 10:45.751
Fucking assholes!

11:09.459 --> 11:11.375
Come in!

11:12.542 --> 11:14.834
Watching anything good?

11:18.375 --> 11:22.459
Good morning.
- I thought you'd be happier to see me.

11:22.584 --> 11:25.498
You've just taken one
of my people into custody.

11:25.498 --> 11:28.263
A mole operating right
under my nose for years.

11:28.334 --> 11:31.380
What good is winning
if you don't get to gloat?

11:49.615 --> 11:52.417
Don't hurt me, I come in peace.

11:52.542 --> 11:54.972
I'm taking Jude to school.
Do you need a lift?

11:55.377 --> 11:58.252
No, I'll ride my bike.
- Okay

11:59.626 --> 12:01.918
Why are you all dressed up?

12:02.083 --> 12:04.584
I have an important meeting today.
- With who?

12:08.370 --> 12:10.807
I'm going to talk to
someone about Reuel Abbott.

12:10.851 --> 12:12.952
I've been thinking
about what you said...

12:12.977 --> 12:14.293
...and if there's a way
to hold him accountable...

12:14.293 --> 12:15.571
...for what he's
done to this family...

12:15.596 --> 12:17.103
...I'm with you to get it done.

12:17.133 --> 12:20.592
Good. - I want you to promise me
that you're going to stay away from him.

12:20.766 --> 12:23.504
He's a a evil prick and I don't
know what he's capable of.

12:24.959 --> 12:27.042
Say it.
- I promise.

12:28.130 --> 12:29.130
Okay.

12:34.542 --> 12:37.334
Oh. I'll get my camera...

12:39.000 --> 12:43.209
You look nice when you want to.
- I'm having lunch with a friend.

12:44.918 --> 12:47.250
I'm gonna go get ready for school.
See you.

12:49.841 --> 12:52.561
Though maybe you'd stayed
over at your lady friend's again.

12:52.561 --> 12:54.894
Oh, no, it was more
of a one-night thing.

12:54.918 --> 12:57.751
Well, you have a way of making
temporary things permanent.

12:59.375 --> 13:02.501
See you later.
- See you.

13:07.792 --> 13:10.339
I'm waiting to hear back from them.

13:10.339 --> 13:12.351
We'll see you at the club.
- I'm on my way.

13:12.375 --> 13:15.626
It's all about who you know...

13:19.459 --> 13:22.292
You sprung for the premium package, huh?

13:45.626 --> 13:47.149
It isn't like Tinder.

13:47.149 --> 13:51.018
You need references from two members
and there's this whole approval process.

13:51.042 --> 13:54.834
Jesus! - Yeah, Jesus couldn't even
get on this dating app, bro.

13:56.250 --> 13:58.542
-Good morning.
-Hey man.

13:58.709 --> 14:01.045
This is an FBI matter now.
We're shutting down the site.

14:01.045 --> 14:02.852
Yeah, I know. I'm just wondering
how you got on with that ambulance.

14:02.883 --> 14:06.763
Ambulance? - Yeah, we put together
a database of rental companies...

14:06.788 --> 14:08.546
...but that's about it.
- Can I get a copy?

14:08.585 --> 14:09.768
Well, the hard drives
are packed away...

14:09.792 --> 14:11.659
You know we already
got the guy, right?

14:11.659 --> 14:15.112
I know.
But it's important.

14:15.959 --> 14:19.167
I can find it for you.
- All right.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.792
Good morning.
- Hey.

14:30.584 --> 14:34.162
Measuring your mark?
- I've got this one all sized up.

14:34.209 --> 14:37.834
He's not much different than anyone
else with a penis. Just a bit more extreme.

14:38.265 --> 14:43.751
Really? - Deep down every man believes
in his own unique specialness.

14:44.113 --> 14:46.893
I think it's a flaw in your gender.
- Thinking we're special?

14:46.918 --> 14:51.125
Thinking that your specialness has
gone unrecognised by everyone else.

14:51.292 --> 14:55.375
That's why someone turns traitor.
To win back that specialness.

14:55.476 --> 14:57.851
If a spy is someone
who keeps secrets...

14:57.876 --> 15:00.268
...a mole is someone who
keeps secrets from other spies.

15:00.292 --> 15:02.751
What could be more special than that?

15:02.918 --> 15:05.496
I'm going to break him.

15:05.520 --> 15:06.940
I'm going to give him no choice...

15:06.964 --> 15:11.057
...but to defend himself with a
declaration of his own importance.

15:11.542 --> 15:14.584
He already looks pretty broken.
What are you waiting for?

15:15.626 --> 15:19.751
Reuel Abbott's in the building.
He had to step away for a few minutes.

15:19.918 --> 15:23.292
I guess nothing stays a secret for long.
- It's okay.

15:23.459 --> 15:25.501
That way we get to kill
two birds with one stone.

15:25.667 --> 15:28.626
The other bird being?
- Him learning to fear me.

15:29.584 --> 15:33.381
How are you doing?
- I feel a crippling guilt.

15:33.381 --> 15:34.852
But other than that, great.

15:34.876 --> 15:37.667
This isn't anybody's
fault but Gordon's.

15:39.584 --> 15:41.417
I know.

15:55.709 --> 15:57.834
Thanks very much.

16:02.918 --> 16:06.667
Anyone good in this movie of yours?
- You know my nephew Sammy?

16:06.818 --> 16:08.357
So it's a student film?

16:08.357 --> 16:11.935
The kid is amazing. He edits
all the effects on his laptop.

16:11.959 --> 16:13.701
Kids these days...

16:13.701 --> 16:19.018
I just saw in a newspaper that a 12-year-old
girl just got into Harvard Medical School.

16:19.042 --> 16:21.000
Here she is.

16:22.626 --> 16:26.334
No, this is not what I'm looking for.
-  It's an ambulance.

16:26.813 --> 16:31.209
No, the kid's got a real specific vision.

16:31.375 --> 16:33.180
I myself am in between cars.

16:33.180 --> 16:34.852
I don't suppose you've
got something I could rent?

16:34.876 --> 16:37.937
Sure, we can scrounge
you up a car.

16:41.727 --> 16:45.453
Sorry for the hold up.
Did I miss anything good?.

16:45.547 --> 16:47.227
No, she's waited for you.

16:47.250 --> 16:50.422
Wants to give me a taste of my own fate, huh?

16:50.501 --> 16:54.417
That's at the heart of any
good drama, don't you think?

16:54.542 --> 16:59.081
Getting to imagine yourself
standing in somebody else's shoes...

16:59.106 --> 17:02.542
It's... I look forward to it, really

17:03.211 --> 17:05.650
-You have a lighter attitude
about this than I expected.

17:05.650 --> 17:08.313
I do, don't I?
I feel lighter.

17:09.603 --> 17:12.584
Robin?

17:12.751 --> 17:16.459
This has all been a
giant misunderstanding.

17:16.550 --> 17:18.450
Lior Lishkott and I are
going into business together.

17:18.474 --> 17:19.481
It's all above board.

17:19.512 --> 17:21.904
I just couldn't report it up the
ladder until I was sure it was real.

17:21.904 --> 17:23.503
You understand that?

17:25.125 --> 17:27.422
The money was just an
advance against my salary.

17:27.422 --> 17:30.507
We were going to lose the house.

17:35.133 --> 17:38.575
Are you going to pull this
intimidation bullshit with me?

17:38.575 --> 17:40.422
Show me a little dignity

17:40.501 --> 17:46.501
How dignified is it to take money from a man
with direct ties to Russian intelligence, Gordon?

17:46.743 --> 17:48.943
Bullshit

17:50.250 --> 17:54.501
It's all in there. Lior's business
is financed by the Kremlin.

17:54.667 --> 17:57.042
He's an SVR asset.

18:10.461 --> 18:13.250
I didn't know.

18:14.375 --> 18:17.501
Right. You're just a spy.

18:17.667 --> 18:21.584
It's not like it's your
business to know such things.

18:22.313 --> 18:25.375
How many blown ops have
you been a part of recently?

18:26.047 --> 18:29.542
Belgrade, Dubrovnik... the
Ukrainian op last week.

18:29.716 --> 18:35.351
How much loss of life and spilled
blood are we talking about here?

18:36.039 --> 18:37.109
You know me.

18:37.140 --> 18:40.921
I think we are well beyond
that assumption, Gordo.

18:40.959 --> 18:44.834
I know how bad it looks, but
what's the logical explanation?

18:45.000 --> 18:48.766
That I suddenly turned against my country
after more than a decade of loyal service...

18:48.766 --> 18:51.953
...or that I did
something fucking stupid?

18:52.083 --> 18:54.542
Those aren't mutually
exclusive possibilities.

18:55.834 --> 19:00.667
If I was to believe that
you were just stupid...

19:00.834 --> 19:03.417
...you'd have to be
pretty fucking stupid!

19:03.542 --> 19:08.042
I swear. I am loyal.

19:16.709 --> 19:19.792
More than a decade, huh?
- Yes

19:19.959 --> 19:22.303
What year did you
join the Agency?

19:22.303 --> 19:23.310
Come on, you know
the answer to that.

19:23.334 --> 19:28.818
You don't like my answers, so why
don't we start hearing yours?

19:31.042 --> 19:33.542
2005.

19:33.678 --> 19:35.982
Why did you join?
- Robin...

19:36.007 --> 19:40.511
I'm trying to figure out where it
all  went wrong for you, Gordon.

19:41.751 --> 19:44.375
Why did you join the CIA?

19:44.501 --> 19:48.042
Go back to being a kid who
didn't know what their future was...

19:48.209 --> 19:52.751
...and who never could have imagined
where life was going to take him.

19:55.751 --> 19:58.542
Jay Atwood? - Are
you the new waiter?

19:58.709 --> 20:00.417
No, I ... -
- I was kidding.

20:00.550 --> 20:02.862
I can tell you're not the new waiter.
You're clearly American.

20:02.862 --> 20:04.471
Who are you?
Why do I care?

20:04.508 --> 20:06.453
Your secretary said
you'd be down here.

20:06.453 --> 20:08.235
Said you don't spend
much time in the office.

20:08.259 --> 20:11.435
This is my office and I've got a
twelve o'clock meeting, so...

20:11.459 --> 20:12.942
I'm your twelve o'clock.

20:12.942 --> 20:17.169
Your office... your other office
said you'd be expecting me.

20:17.192 --> 20:18.312
Tracy Crane...

20:21.161 --> 20:25.371
You're Tracy Crane...
Ah shit!

20:25.599 --> 20:27.428
You were expecting a woman?

20:27.428 --> 20:33.537
Yeah, I was expecting a....
Got dressed up, showered and everything.

20:34.043 --> 20:37.308
Welcome to Athens.
Jay Attwood.

20:37.348 --> 20:38.823
You hungry?
You want some lunch?

20:38.823 --> 20:41.963
Sure.
- Bring him the special...

20:42.459 --> 20:44.125
Sit down.

20:46.292 --> 20:51.501
The food here is excellent, but Athens
station is a fucking loukaniko party.

20:51.782 --> 20:53.454
You know what a loukaniko is?
- No.

20:53.462 --> 20:56.851
Loukaniko is sausage. What I'm
saying is that Athens is a sausage party.

20:56.876 --> 21:01.008
I thought we were getting some new talent.
- Sorry to disappoint.

21:01.365 --> 21:04.584
So, is this your first posting?
- Yeah.

21:04.766 --> 21:08.057
Well, Athens is a good place
to pop your cherry.

21:08.216 --> 21:10.939
Maybe you'd rather pop her cherry?
Huh?

21:10.939 --> 21:13.405
I'm married.
We have a three year old.

21:13.542 --> 21:15.626
And the guy's got an
answer for everything...

21:21.042 --> 21:25.834
So? Why'd you join
the you know what?

21:26.000 --> 21:29.334
I'm talking about the CIA.

21:29.501 --> 21:32.415
To serve my country.
Something that's intellectually stimu...

21:32.415 --> 21:35.179
No, no, no. No, stop.
Don't give me the bullshit answer.

21:35.204 --> 21:37.709
You already got the job.
 - I was...I'm not...

21:37.876 --> 21:41.998
Come on. When you were six
years old, what did you want to be?

21:42.052 --> 21:44.216
Fireman?
- Astronaut.

21:44.241 --> 21:47.608
Yeah? So what are you still
doing down here on earth?

21:54.902 --> 21:58.542
I think I internalised at a
young age that I was special.

21:58.709 --> 22:01.918
That I had the potential to do
something important in the world.

22:03.626 --> 22:06.167
And I've never really
let go of that idea.

22:10.375 --> 22:13.709
One too many attaboys, huh?

22:13.876 --> 22:18.876
All right. All right.
Now we're getting someplace.

22:22.375 --> 22:24.834
Thank you for seeing me,
Senator Trask.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.876
Reuel Abbott is a very powerful
man. I understand your concern.

22:31.042 --> 22:33.589
I don't imagine there are many
people who have seen his dark side...

22:33.589 --> 22:35.351
...and are willing to talk about it.

22:35.375 --> 22:38.042
Reuel has been operating
out of bounds for far too long.

22:38.544 --> 22:41.045
The American people deserve
to know the truth about anyone

22:41.045 --> 22:42.693
we entrust with the
exercise of power

22:43.115 --> 22:46.216
I want to show you I will do
everything within my power

22:46.292 --> 22:49.167
to protect you from
the possibility of retribution.

22:50.125 --> 22:55.542
But if it's too much for you, if you
need more time, are having doubts

22:55.709 --> 22:59.334
I don't want to pressure you into
saying something you're not ready to say.

22:59.501 --> 23:03.292
No ... I'm ready.

23:05.501 --> 23:07.334
Well?

23:07.501 --> 23:12.209
I have been to every lot between here and
Baltimore looking for this exact ambulance.

23:12.375 --> 23:14.709
It was just used in
a bank heist movie.

23:14.876 --> 23:17.156
Oh yeah? What was the name of the film?
- I don't remember.

23:17.226 --> 23:19.333
You don't remember the name
of the guy who rented it from you?

23:19.333 --> 23:22.917
I maintain strict confidentiality
with all my customers.

23:23.042 --> 23:25.190
So, what's your film all about?

23:26.432 --> 23:28.612
I'm not making a movie.

23:37.626 --> 23:40.501
Neither was the guy
that rented this from you.

23:40.667 --> 23:45.792
Movies use blanks. This
was used for something else.

23:48.334 --> 23:54.709
If you give me the renter's information,
your part in this ends here.

25:06.709 --> 25:10.959
I didn't question Sam's death until
Iris came along.  - Iris Loramer?

25:13.250 --> 25:16.292
She told me that Sam was
involved in the death of her husband

25:16.459 --> 25:19.974
and she had proof.
She'd filmed them together.

25:20.341 --> 25:25.417
I saw it. My husband who I thought I knew
ordering the death of one of her friends.

25:27.626 --> 25:31.258
I know that you've seen it.
Now I'd like you to unsee it.

25:31.258 --> 25:33.518
Go get it for me.
Put it in my hand.

25:33.542 --> 25:36.876
Once you accused me
of threatening your family.

25:37.042 --> 25:40.918
At that time it was the
furthest thing from my mind.

25:41.083 --> 25:45.459
So you gave it to him - the media card?
- What else could I do?

25:45.584 --> 25:48.083
They can kill you and
make it look like an accident.

25:50.501 --> 25:56.209
I know that I shouldn't have given
it to him. I was just so scared.

25:56.375 --> 26:00.751
You did the right thing at the time ...
and you're doing the right thing now.

26:08.751 --> 26:11.250
It's Tracy.
Leave a message.

26:11.417 --> 26:15.714
It's me. I've found the ambulance. I've got
the guy's address and I'm on my way there.

26:15.714 --> 26:16.714
Call me back

26:30.709 --> 26:32.685
How long have you been married?

26:36.709 --> 26:37.876
I love it here!

26:38.017 --> 26:42.017
I found this cute little bazaar,
and then Anders...

26:42.042 --> 26:43.562
What are you doing?

26:44.417 --> 26:49.501
I just realized ... that
Anders is asleep

26:51.459 --> 26:57.000
You don't want to hear about my day?
 - Yes, I'm very good at multi-tasking.

26:57.167 --> 27:02.501
Tell me ... about that bazaar.

27:13.167 --> 27:15.584
Sorry.

27:23.959 --> 27:28.292
Have you noticed that all NFL
quarterbacks could be models?

27:28.459 --> 27:30.667
No, but I'm guessing that you've
got a theory on the subject.

27:31.396 --> 27:36.209
Great leaders are not born.
They're made.

27:36.234 --> 27:39.586
They are bred with years
of confidence-building

27:39.609 --> 27:41.643
starting all the way
back at the playground.

27:41.667 --> 27:43.667
How many times have you
heard the sentence growing up...

27:43.834 --> 27:48.959
"You're going to be a
heart-breaker, Tracy." Right?

27:49.125 --> 27:55.250
That sense of specialness that
you internalised in your youth.

27:55.417 --> 27:57.620
That's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

27:57.620 --> 28:00.420
It's the same shit they said to Tom Brady.

28:01.709 --> 28:03.375
An interesting theory.

28:06.584 --> 28:09.334
Okay, I got to take a piss.

28:23.479 --> 28:25.120
Baby, come here.

28:28.918 --> 28:31.083
Where we going?

28:32.125 --> 28:35.667
I'm leaving Athens.
- Why?

28:35.834 --> 28:41.667
Because you're a fucking shit!
That came in the mail today.

28:47.250 --> 28:50.876
Baby...
- Fucking asshole.

28:59.509 --> 29:03.345
I thought you were married.
- Huh?

29:03.370 --> 29:05.713
They sent us a copy.

29:06.959 --> 29:09.042
They send one to your wife?

29:11.834 --> 29:14.918
Fucking Russians, man.
I am sorry.

29:16.083 --> 29:18.417
Russians?
- She was a honey pot.

29:19.751 --> 29:23.667
I thought you were slick.
I thought you were Tom Brady.

29:23.834 --> 29:25.250
Did she leave you?

29:27.501 --> 29:29.212
Went back to Virginia.

29:29.212 --> 29:31.899
Well, you won't be too far behind
her so maybe you'll want her back.

29:32.532 --> 29:33.415
What?

29:33.415 --> 29:35.477
Your flight
leaves at 8am tomorrow.

29:35.501 --> 29:38.314
Pack what you need. I'll have
the rest shipped over to you.

29:38.321 --> 29:38.976
I don't understand.

29:39.000 --> 29:44.945
C'mon man. You're a smart guy.
We're taking you off the field.

29:51.427 --> 29:53.334
You've had a pretty
mediocre career.

29:54.125 --> 29:59.309
Things didn't go exactly as planned,
but that doesn't make me traitor.

29:59.334 --> 30:01.912
But taking money from
a Russian asset does.

30:01.912 --> 30:02.802
Lior played me.

30:02.827 --> 30:05.667
No, I bet my career
that you're dirty.

30:05.834 --> 30:10.667
I thought he was just ex-Mossad
and no shit about Russia. He said...

30:11.751 --> 30:15.708
...he said I was the business
partner he was looking for

30:15.708 --> 30:18.512
He stroked my ego.
I fell for it.

30:19.230 --> 30:22.417
I needed the money.
- We all need the money.

30:22.542 --> 30:24.844
You have to believe me.
- No.

30:24.876 --> 30:30.292
You have to convince me. And
you are not very convincing.

30:30.459 --> 30:36.167
Frankly, the only part I'm having a hard time
believing is how anybody can be such a loser.

30:36.334 --> 30:38.250
Fuck you, Robin.

30:47.334 --> 30:52.584
You okay?
- Sorry, Gordon is a friend.

30:52.751 --> 30:56.083
No apology necessary.

30:56.250 --> 30:59.918
It's never easy to learn that a
friend isn't who you thought they were.

33:18.667 --> 33:21.000
Matty?

33:30.042 --> 33:31.876
Matty?

33:37.501 --> 33:39.501
Fuck!

33:41.542 --> 33:43.459
Fuck!

34:31.958 --> 34:35.000
You were in the car with him.
- I can explain.

34:35.167 --> 34:38.708
The fuck you do?
Why d'you kill Matty?

34:38.876 --> 34:41.183
Because of the Russians?
Because you guys were working together...

34:41.183 --> 34:42.797
He's dead!

34:42.833 --> 34:45.143
What?
- We didn't kill him.

34:45.143 --> 34:48.833
We were gonna make...
What? what? You didn't... He's alive?!

34:48.878 --> 34:52.417
We was gonna hand him over, man!
- To who? The Russians?

34:52.542 --> 34:55.569
The Russians? We
were working for the CIA.

34:55.569 --> 34:56.560
Who at the CIA?

34:56.583 --> 35:00.125
You fucking with my head, man!
- I'm on your side.

35:00.299 --> 35:02.792
And that's not such a good place
to be 'cos everyone's dead!

35:02.817 --> 35:06.334
Calm down. You need to hear me,
okay. I'm unarmed.

35:06.501 --> 35:11.250
Do you have any idea how many
unarmed men I've killed? One or two...

35:13.397 --> 35:16.102
Don't fucking move! Stay
on the fucking ground!

35:16.102 --> 35:18.310
I'm a federal agent. My name is Joe Turner

35:18.334 --> 35:22.834
Joe Turner? You were in the car with
Sirin when that whole deal went down.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.459
Dale Fridrych, FBI.

35:26.768 --> 35:29.433
I got a lead on Letts,
an informant who said...

35:29.433 --> 35:32.185
he and his crew were
contracted to kill Sirin.

35:32.209 --> 35:35.083
No, not kill - kidnap.
And he got away.

35:35.250 --> 35:37.453
So, is Sirin alive?
- I think so.

35:37.453 --> 35:39.386
Do you know where he is?
- No.

35:39.501 --> 35:44.834
You're bleeding. I got a first aid
kit in my truck. Wait here a minute.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.334
What the fuck is going on ...?

35:56.876 --> 35:59.125
It's Tracy. Leave a message.

36:28.918 --> 36:33.709
I am impressed. Your little speech
brought Mr. Crane to tears.

36:33.876 --> 36:36.667
Tracy's too close to the case.

36:36.834 --> 36:41.459
He tried to persuade me Gordon was being set up
by the Russians to protect the real infiltrator.

36:41.559 --> 36:46.051
Tracy is a good man and good
men like to think the best of others.

36:46.076 --> 36:47.818
Not like us.

37:48.167 --> 37:49.959
Leave a message.

38:04.802 --> 38:08.417
Two dead guys. Our guy's skull is cracked
open. Probably a drug deal gone wrong.

38:08.542 --> 38:12.959
He's going on about how we can't arrest
him because he works for the government.

38:13.125 --> 38:15.981
Excuse me?
- Yes.

38:15.981 --> 38:17.982
I'm here for Joseph Turner.

38:18.130 --> 38:21.521
Are you a lawyer?
- No, I'm the deputy director of the CIA.

38:34.007 --> 38:37.727
I checked. There is no Dale
Fridrych working for the CIMC.

38:37.727 --> 38:39.360
The Russians are cleaning
up after themselves.

38:39.360 --> 38:39.943
Cleaning up what?

38:39.967 --> 38:42.287
They set up Gordon to
protect their actual inside man.

38:42.287 --> 38:44.326
This whole fucking thing has
been one big active measure.

38:44.375 --> 38:49.125
If this is a disinformation campaign you and
Ms Larkin really stepped into it, didn't you?

38:49.292 --> 38:51.876
What are you going to do now?

38:54.250 --> 38:58.751
If Sirin's alive and you can find him,
maybe he can tell you who the mole is.

38:58.893 --> 39:03.086
Too bad you didn't pick a place to meet
in the event things didn't go as planned.

39:03.121 --> 39:04.111
Trade craft 101.

39:05.751 --> 39:09.834
I'm not the only one who
made an obvious mistake.

39:10.000 --> 39:15.542
Am I? You were in Bob's office
the night that he died.

39:15.709 --> 39:19.751
Why didn't you go through his files?
- Maybe I was overcome by grief.

39:19.918 --> 39:23.751
Yeah, or maybe you have reason
to hang Gordon Piper out to dry.

39:25.209 --> 39:27.209
Good night.

39:55.334 --> 39:57.709
What can I get you?
Bourbon whiskey.

40:08.584 --> 40:12.501
It makes sense that a man who
was once burned would fear fire.

40:12.667 --> 40:16.250
Do we know each other?
- Of course I know you, Tracy.

40:17.667 --> 40:21.918
Sorry, I don't remember you.
- That's because we've never met.

40:22.083 --> 40:25.501
But I've been looking for someone
like you for a very long time.

40:26.876 --> 40:29.501
I think you mistake
me for someone else.

40:31.083 --> 40:33.250
No I don't think so.

40:37.209 --> 40:39.083
There you go...

41:36.292 --> 41:38.667
I need to see you.

41:43.576 --> 41:45.501
Food time!

41:48.250 --> 41:54.000
Where's Dad?
- He's still at work. C'mon, let's eat.

43:01.876 --> 43:04.042
You've been crying, huh?

43:05.751 --> 43:08.000
Yeah, I've had a hell of a day, too.

43:09.334 --> 43:10.834
Thank you for coming.

43:26.982 --> 43:28.709
You and I should go away together.

43:28.709 --> 43:31.294
When?
- Right now.

43:32.184 --> 43:35.411
It's crazy... I can't.
- It makes perfect sense to me.

43:35.436 --> 43:37.099
We'll leave as soon
as you're packed.

43:37.248 --> 43:42.042
I have children. Someone
has to drive them and feed them...

43:42.200 --> 43:44.928
...and stand over them
when they do their homework.

43:44.928 --> 43:46.591
Ask your mom to look after them.

43:46.959 --> 43:51.042
I've a shift tomorrow.
- Get another doctor to cover it.

43:51.209 --> 43:57.000
You have an answer for everything, huh?
- No, just us two things.

43:57.167 --> 43:59.675
If we leave right now we
can be there before midnight.

43:59.675 --> 44:02.456
Where?
- It's a surprise.

44:02.509 --> 44:04.946
Well then how would I know what to pack?

44:04.946 --> 44:06.657
Just bring one of everything.

45:09.834 --> 45:15.564
Joe? My name is Ekaterina.
My American friends call me Kat.

45:15.564 --> 45:17.364
We have a friend in common.

45:18.292 --> 45:19.822
Where is Vasili?

45:19.822 --> 45:22.643
He sent me. Let's get moving so
we don't draw attention to ourselves.
