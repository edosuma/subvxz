00:15.480 --> 00:17.596
Um...

00:22.600 --> 00:24.591
(phone rings)

00:26.640 --> 00:28.631
Ow.

00:32.720 --> 00:34.438
- What?
- Jack.

00:34.520 --> 00:38.559
I've translated the writing on the
colonnade SG-2 discovered on P3X-439.

00:38.640 --> 00:40.198
I'll be there in half an hour.

00:40.280 --> 00:43.238
It talks about
a library of knowledge, Jack.

00:43.320 --> 00:46.437
I think the monument contains
a repository of the Ancients.

00:46.520 --> 00:47.873
Repository?

00:47.960 --> 00:51.350
That thing that grabbed your head,
made you talk crazy.

00:51.440 --> 00:54.716
Sounds like we should stay away, then.

00:54.800 --> 00:58.349
We should be able to find
another way to access the information.

00:58.440 --> 01:03.833
Sam's used Tok'ra crystals to find a way
to transfer all kinds of different energy.

01:03.920 --> 01:06.036
(Daniel continues talking)

01:07.040 --> 01:09.156
...we should go there as soon as possible.

01:09.240 --> 01:11.674
- Yeah?
- So?

01:11.760 --> 01:14.558
- I'll be there in half an hour.
- OK. Bye.

01:14.640 --> 01:18.838
No, no, no, wait. Don't hang up.
I need a seven-letter word.

01:19.680 --> 01:24.515
- I told Sam I wouldn't help you.
- This'll be one thing she doesn't know.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.990
"Up, down, charmed, blank."

01:28.080 --> 01:29.832
Strange.

01:30.760 --> 01:33.320
Yeah. Well, thanks anyway.

01:33.400 --> 01:35.994
No, the word you're looking for...

01:44.400 --> 01:47.472
(woman) I know, I know.
I couldn't get her off the phone.

01:47.560 --> 01:49.835
I should be done by noon.

01:49.920 --> 01:53.037
Whatever it is,
I'm sure it won't take long to say no.

01:53.120 --> 01:55.839
I'll be at Georgetown
at two for my Poli-Sci class,

01:55.920 --> 01:59.993
and I'm speaking at the
Women in Washington dinner at seven.

02:00.080 --> 02:04.710
I'll call you back. This guy's gonna steal
my cab. I called for a taxi ten minutes ago.

02:04.800 --> 02:07.234
(speaks in Russian)

02:07.440 --> 02:09.954
(speaks in Russian)

02:10.039 --> 02:11.598
As do I.

02:11.680 --> 02:14.148
I cannot be late.
I'm going to the White House.

02:14.240 --> 02:17.516
I have to be there in 15 minutes.
I'm meeting with the president.

02:17.600 --> 02:22.515
- Of the United States. Really, I am.
- Hey. One of you gonna get in or what?

02:22.600 --> 02:25.831
Wait! Can I offer you a cab fare,
wherever you need to go?

02:25.920 --> 02:30.357
- Can you call this man another taxi?
- Excuse me, Dr Weir.

02:30.440 --> 02:34.115
- Please get in, ma'am.
- Uh...

02:34.200 --> 02:36.191
(speaks in Russian)

02:43.080 --> 02:45.071
Mr Vice President.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.151
Dr Weir.

03:52.760 --> 03:55.320
It wasn't necessary
for you to pick me up, sir.

03:55.400 --> 03:58.358
I was on my way from the athletic club.

03:58.440 --> 04:03.878
Besides, there are very few people who
could properly brief you for this interview.

04:04.360 --> 04:06.999
Uh, interview?
I agreed to have just a meeting...

04:07.080 --> 04:10.959
How would you respond if I told you
the Air Force is currently conducting

04:11.040 --> 04:16.956
top-secret operations with an alien
transportation device called the Stargate?

04:17.040 --> 04:22.433
It was discovered in the early 1900s at
Giza, not too far from the Great Pyramids.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.589
Is this a joke?

04:29.680 --> 04:33.195
- What is it?
- A note from the president.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.239
And you might wanna read this, too.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.511
Oh, my God.

05:07.280 --> 05:10.352
- How long have you been waiting?
- You said half an hour.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.829
General Hammond's waiting.

05:16.360 --> 05:17.793
Excuse me.

05:17.880 --> 05:21.475
The fate of the world is in the balance
and you've been finishing this?

05:21.560 --> 05:24.233
I believe it was double or nothing.

05:24.320 --> 05:29.269
OK. 23 across. "The atomic weight
of boron." The answer is ten.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.789
- Yes.
- You wrote the word "fat".

05:31.880 --> 05:34.155
Your point?

05:37.880 --> 05:40.269
Should be out of here.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.872
Harper. Reynolds.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.951
- (Harper) Sir.
- Jack.

05:45.040 --> 05:49.352
SG-3 spotted a Goa'uld reconnaissance
drone where they found the colonnade.

05:49.440 --> 05:52.079
Since that means
the Goa'uld were aware of it,

05:52.160 --> 05:54.913
SGs 3 and 5 will be providing backup.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.117
If General Hammond
approves the mission.

05:59.200 --> 06:03.273
- What mission?
- Good morning, SG-1.

06:03.360 --> 06:07.319
- Nice of you to join us.
- Good morning, sir.

06:10.440 --> 06:13.557
I've read Dr Jackson's report
on his translation.

06:13.640 --> 06:16.712
After the last time
you encountered something like this,

06:16.800 --> 06:19.917
I'm surprised you're so willing
to take on this mission.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.673
So am I, sir.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.830
Jack.

06:24.920 --> 06:26.478
Daniel.

06:26.560 --> 06:30.599
Why wouldn't we want to gain access
to the greatest repository of knowledge?

06:30.680 --> 06:32.671
Find the Lost City of the Ancients,

06:32.760 --> 06:38.676
and use their technology to save the
entire galaxy from the evil of the Goa'uld?

06:38.760 --> 06:40.751
Well, there's that.

06:40.840 --> 06:45.231
From the mission file I've read,
this thing whips up from the wall,

06:45.320 --> 06:47.550
grabs your head and
rearranges your brain.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.437
- Sort of.
- Sort of?

06:49.520 --> 06:53.957
It downloads the entire library of
Ancient knowledge into a person's mind.

06:54.040 --> 06:57.157
That massive amount of data
then unspools into your brain,

06:57.240 --> 06:59.674
eventually taking over
your consciousness.

06:59.760 --> 07:03.912
- But it wasn't meant for primitives like us.
- Easy, fella.

07:04.480 --> 07:07.199
The report said
you almost died last time, sir.

07:07.280 --> 07:13.071
The Asgard removed the information from
O'Neill's mind before he was lost to us.

07:13.160 --> 07:17.073
So, why don't we just shoot Thor a call?
Get him standing by as backup.

07:17.160 --> 07:19.435
We tried, sir. He's not responding.

07:19.520 --> 07:24.230
None of our alien allies have been reliable
of late. Should something happen again...

07:24.320 --> 07:26.788
No one should interface with the device.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.269
We're suggesting
it be brought home for study.

07:29.360 --> 07:33.273
The engineering team that studied
the last one of these devices you found

07:33.360 --> 07:35.715
determined nothing
after months of research.

07:35.800 --> 07:41.477
We believe that device's power source
was depleted when O'Neill activated it.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.915
Recent intel suggests Anubis has become

07:44.000 --> 07:48.596
a serious threat to dominate the rest
of the Goa'uld in a very short time.

07:48.680 --> 07:52.150
We have to consider
Earth is at risk now more than ever.

07:52.240 --> 07:54.708
If the knowledge
contained within this device

07:54.800 --> 08:01.194
can lead us to technologies we can use
to defend ourselves, we must pursue it.

08:01.280 --> 08:04.989
- Why didn't you just say that?
- Sorry.

08:05.080 --> 08:08.356
You have a go. And be careful, people.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.675
The file you read in the car
is just the beginning.

08:19.760 --> 08:24.675
You might want to familiarise yourself
with more of this before you take the job.

08:24.760 --> 08:30.710
Take the job? I just found out
that science fiction isn't fiction.

08:30.800 --> 08:34.759
I mean, I've known there were secrets,
big secrets, but this is...

08:34.840 --> 08:41.438
I don't know what's scarier - the fact that
this is all true or that you're telling me.

08:41.520 --> 08:46.310
I can't imagine what kind of job you're
offering me, but I don't care any more.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.676
I realise you haven't met the president yet.

08:49.760 --> 08:52.035
Just try and say no.

08:59.640 --> 09:03.110
(Davis over PA) Chevron seven locked.

09:06.680 --> 09:11.231
SG teams 1, 3 and 5, good luck.
God speed.

09:11.320 --> 09:14.232
Thank you, sir. Let's move out.

09:37.640 --> 09:43.317
Reynolds. Set up a defence perimeter as
you see fit. Hold the gate till we get back.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.960
- You got it.
- Sir.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.429
SG-1, move out.

09:59.560 --> 10:03.439
(O'Neill) You know,
we've searched this place, up and down.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.511
(Daniel) I know.

10:07.600 --> 10:11.912
We could have Goa'uld
on our collective asses any minute now.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.991
(Daniel) I know.

10:16.440 --> 10:20.638
According to the text
in this column, it's inside.

10:22.040 --> 10:24.235
Inside, you say?

10:25.880 --> 10:28.997
Well, let me tell you, my friend,

10:29.080 --> 10:31.753
there is no "inside".

10:32.680 --> 10:36.798
There's just a whole lotta outside.

10:36.880 --> 10:38.711
I know.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.792
(Carter) I'm getting some
strange readings from here.

10:41.880 --> 10:43.871
If I'm right...

10:49.760 --> 10:51.751
Look out.

10:57.920 --> 11:00.798
- (O'Neill) Reynolds, come in.
- Go ahead.

11:00.880 --> 11:05.351
- Yeah, we got something here. Stand by.
- All clear for the moment.

11:15.320 --> 11:20.030
Now we just have to figure out
how to get this thing out of the wall.

11:24.920 --> 11:27.388
- Damn.
- Careful.

11:27.480 --> 11:31.951
All right, one more time.
Why are we doing this? Why?

11:34.360 --> 11:39.070
- You hear something, Harper?
- We got multiple bogeys, coming in fast.

11:39.160 --> 11:43.995
Dial the gate. Send constant radio signal.
We have to keep that door open.

11:44.080 --> 11:48.073
(Reynolds) SG-1, we have incoming.

12:01.560 --> 12:04.233
- (O'Neill) Let's go.
- We can't just leave.

12:04.320 --> 12:05.355
Daniel.

12:05.440 --> 12:10.116
We must not allow this device
to fall into the hands of Anubis.

12:11.120 --> 12:13.111
Fine.

12:14.640 --> 12:16.631
- Jack!
- He's right. If we destroy it,

12:16.720 --> 12:20.429
we lose our only chance to find
the location of the Lost City.

12:20.520 --> 12:22.875
O'Neill.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.277
Ah, crap.

12:28.840 --> 12:31.354
All right, then what?

12:31.440 --> 12:34.113
No, no, no, no, no.

12:34.200 --> 12:38.273
Jack, somebody has to do it.
The answer is in there.

12:38.360 --> 12:41.079
If we don't find the Lost City,
we're as good as dead.

12:41.160 --> 12:45.233
And who does the translating
when you go Ancient?

12:56.480 --> 13:00.268
In fact, you're the one person
who can't do it.

13:02.080 --> 13:04.116
Jack!

13:04.200 --> 13:06.156
(Carter) Sir!

13:15.000 --> 13:16.956
O'Neill.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.755
SG-1, where the hell are you guys?
We can't hold out for long.

13:26.800 --> 13:30.839
Colonel Reynolds,
we are headed back to the gate.

13:38.320 --> 13:41.756
Hold positions. Greaves, you're with me.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.511
Take cover!

14:04.480 --> 14:07.552
Jack. Jack, you OK?

14:07.640 --> 14:11.315
- What's going on?
- Come on. Let's get him up.

14:25.320 --> 14:29.074
- (Reynolds) Coming through the gate.
- (Harper) We're behind you. Go!

14:35.560 --> 14:38.438
- What happened?
- Didn't quite go according to plan.

14:38.520 --> 14:42.559
- We have to get him to the infirmary.
- I did it again.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.631
Dr Weir.

15:06.440 --> 15:08.749
Sorry to have kept you so late.

15:08.840 --> 15:12.594
That's all right.
I've been doing a little reading.

15:12.680 --> 15:15.990
Mr President, I mean,
this is truly so outrageous,

15:16.080 --> 15:19.550
I feel compelled on behalf
of everyone who has no idea that...

15:19.640 --> 15:24.589
Megan. Could you get
a car ready for Dr Weir?

15:24.680 --> 15:28.195
Five minutes. Thanks.

15:28.280 --> 15:30.271
Sit down.

15:31.920 --> 15:36.710
- Would you like something?
- No, thank you.

15:39.400 --> 15:43.029
Your reaction was very similar
to mine when I found out.

15:43.120 --> 15:45.315
I'm sorry. Five minutes, sir?

15:45.400 --> 15:49.154
The negotiation
you mediated in North Africa?

15:49.240 --> 15:52.038
Yes? What does that have to do with this?

15:53.080 --> 15:58.837
Just that the Stargate probably
makes that seem like child's play.

15:58.920 --> 16:03.232
Well, frankly, sir, I have absolutely
no idea what you want from me.

16:03.320 --> 16:09.236
You brokered a dozen of the most
sensitive treaties in modern times,

16:09.320 --> 16:11.356
speak God knows how many languages.

16:11.440 --> 16:13.590
Just five.

16:13.680 --> 16:16.148
Five.

16:17.240 --> 16:20.437
I suppose your aversion
to the military will be an issue.

16:20.520 --> 16:22.875
What are we talking about, exactly?

16:22.960 --> 16:26.236
You running the Stargate programme.

16:27.240 --> 16:28.832
Oh.

16:33.640 --> 16:36.950
- How in the hell did this happen?
- It wasn't an accident.

16:37.040 --> 16:40.032
- He did it deliberately.
- To access the Ancients' knowledge.

16:40.120 --> 16:43.999
He, uh... We figured
we'd never get another shot at it.

16:44.080 --> 16:48.437
We know that the Ancient knowledge
will essentially overwrite his brain.

16:48.520 --> 16:52.308
We're hoping he'll become aware
of the information we're looking for.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.833
And then?

16:53.920 --> 16:57.037
Then it will overwhelm
his nervous system, and he will...

16:57.120 --> 17:00.669
What? Meet my maker? Pay the piper?

17:00.760 --> 17:05.992
Breach the pearly gates?
Start pushing up daisies here and there?

17:08.400 --> 17:10.391
You should be in the infirmary.

17:10.480 --> 17:14.758
Why? We all know
exactly what's gonna happen.

17:14.839 --> 17:17.752
In a few days,
I start speaking some strange language.

17:17.839 --> 17:21.355
Few days after that, I start
doing things beyond my control.

17:21.440 --> 17:27.390
And a few days after that, it's
"Good night, my someone, good night."

17:29.840 --> 17:35.551
With your permission, I'd like to take
the weekend, get a few things together.

17:35.640 --> 17:39.792
Last time, it took a couple of days
before we noticed a change in behaviour.

17:39.880 --> 17:42.997
I'll be back Monday, ready to work.

17:43.080 --> 17:46.197
- Permission granted.
- Thank you, sir.

17:47.200 --> 17:53.275
Now, if you'll excuse me, my favourite
television show starts in half an hour.

18:00.600 --> 18:03.672
We've already done an initial review,

18:03.760 --> 18:06.911
and we've decided
to suspend current operations

18:07.000 --> 18:11.118
until a new government division
can be established.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.760
The Stargate is a dangerous thing,

18:13.840 --> 18:18.391
but given what we know is going on
out there, it's something we can't ignore.

18:18.480 --> 18:21.631
No, obviously not.

18:21.720 --> 18:24.757
I don't want this
to sound terribly self-centred...

18:24.840 --> 18:27.308
- Why you?
- Why me?

18:27.400 --> 18:30.676
- What do you think?
- Well,

18:30.760 --> 18:34.548
I'm betting other world leaders
are pressuring you for control.

18:34.640 --> 18:38.394
- See? I knew you were a quick study.
- And I can advise you there.

18:38.480 --> 18:42.075
But I am not qualified
to negotiate with aliens.

18:42.160 --> 18:45.755
No one is, Doctor - not you, not me.

18:45.840 --> 18:48.798
But someone has to do it.

18:49.480 --> 18:55.077
The fact is, we can't keep
this thing a secret forever.

18:55.160 --> 18:59.199
And you wanna put a friendly face
on this thing when it goes public,

18:59.280 --> 19:01.794
someone less threatening
than a US general.

19:01.880 --> 19:04.030
People will panic.

19:04.120 --> 19:08.477
It's going to take
anything and everything we have

19:08.560 --> 19:12.439
to keep our civilisation
from turning upside down.

19:12.520 --> 19:16.672
But, make no mistake, you're not just
a figurehead for the sake of publicity.

19:16.760 --> 19:20.070
I chose you for a damn good reason.

19:24.240 --> 19:29.360
- I take it my five minutes are up.
- Actually, it was seven.

19:29.440 --> 19:32.432
Don't worry, this is just the beginning.

19:38.280 --> 19:40.316
What if I say no, sir?

19:40.400 --> 19:42.994
Never going to happen.

19:45.560 --> 19:46.754
Bonnie!

19:46.840 --> 19:51.834
Come on in here. Thank you.
Good seeing you again.

19:53.680 --> 19:57.798
So, things aren't
quite as simple as they seemed.

19:57.880 --> 20:00.075
It never seemed simple, sir.

20:00.160 --> 20:02.628
Be careful who you trust, Doctor.

20:02.720 --> 20:05.951
Does that include you, sir?

20:06.040 --> 20:11.034
He may be the president, but I am
the one person you want on your side.

20:11.120 --> 20:15.796
And the one person
you don't wanna cross.

20:21.280 --> 20:23.589
(knock at door)

20:26.960 --> 20:28.871
Hi, sir.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.394
Carter?

20:31.480 --> 20:33.948
- Did I wake you?
- Sorta.

20:35.520 --> 20:38.353
- I couldn't sleep last night.
- Should've called.

20:38.440 --> 20:41.113
I didn't want to bother you. I...

20:43.480 --> 20:45.277
Um...

20:46.280 --> 20:49.158
I was just looking at the sky.

20:49.240 --> 20:53.518
Trying to figure out
how many stars we'd actually been to.

20:53.600 --> 20:59.357
Actually, only a few of the stars visible
from Earth have Stargates on them, so...

20:59.440 --> 21:02.989
I knew that. Hammond send you by
to check up on me?

21:03.080 --> 21:05.389
No.

21:05.480 --> 21:07.914
It's funny, really. I, uh...

21:08.000 --> 21:11.675
I was out driving, you know, in my car,

21:11.760 --> 21:15.355
and I, um... I drove here.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.517
- Funny.
- Yeah.

21:23.600 --> 21:26.672
There's coffee around here. I think.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.515
Maybe not. How about a beer?

21:36.600 --> 21:38.795
Sure. Why not?

21:56.400 --> 22:01.110
- Want a glass? I can wash one.
- No, I'm fine. Thank you, sir.

22:02.560 --> 22:05.597
Sir, do you ever talk to her?

22:05.680 --> 22:07.875
Can we not talk about that?

22:07.960 --> 22:10.269
Sorry.

22:10.360 --> 22:14.876
- How you feeling?
- Can we not talk about that, either?

22:14.960 --> 22:17.554
OK.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.029
What do you wanna talk about?

22:24.040 --> 22:28.795
You wanna be alone.
This was a bad... I should go.

22:28.880 --> 22:31.110
Finish your beer.

22:32.760 --> 22:36.992
And then you have to wait
at least an hour before you drive.

22:40.840 --> 22:42.831
Sir...

22:50.320 --> 22:52.311
What?

22:53.400 --> 22:57.791
- I should have done it.
- What? Stick your head in that thing?

22:57.880 --> 23:00.917
Are you nuts?

23:03.200 --> 23:09.799
Carter, you're one of this country's natural
resources, if not national treasures.

23:12.640 --> 23:15.632
It couldn't have gone down any other way.

23:19.520 --> 23:22.114
I just... hope it's worth it.

23:23.840 --> 23:26.195
Even if we do find the Lost City,

23:26.280 --> 23:29.750
even if we get there and find
what we need to defend the planet...

23:29.840 --> 23:33.150
That would be worth it.

23:35.920 --> 23:37.956
(knock at door)

23:44.080 --> 23:45.274
Hello.

23:49.880 --> 23:51.598
In here.

24:00.560 --> 24:02.676
Sorry. Are we interrupting anything?

24:02.760 --> 24:05.877
- (both) No.
- What are you doing here?

24:05.960 --> 24:09.430
Uh... It's a funny story, actually.

24:09.520 --> 24:13.718
- We were driving by and saw Sam's car...
- Funny.

24:13.800 --> 24:18.635
Teal'c said... He didn't say anything, he
looked at me and did that eyebrow thing.

24:18.720 --> 24:21.632
And I said to him
"Hey, why don't we stop by..."

24:21.720 --> 24:24.439
Is that doughnuts?

24:24.520 --> 24:26.909
- Indeed.
- Excellent.

24:33.120 --> 24:35.111
(Anubis) Rise.

24:36.720 --> 24:41.157
My lord, I believe the humans of the
Tauri destroyed the device you sought.

24:41.240 --> 24:46.712
- You failed to stop them.
- They anticipated our arrival, my lord.

25:02.600 --> 25:05.956
(O'Neill) You are so wrong.

25:06.040 --> 25:08.429
It's the perfect analogy.

25:08.520 --> 25:11.478
Burns as Goa'uld.

25:11.560 --> 25:13.790
They are merely animated characters.

25:13.880 --> 25:16.314
You are so shallow.

25:16.400 --> 25:19.119
Please! Teal'c is one of
the deepest people I know.

25:19.200 --> 25:23.113
He's so deep. Go on,
tell him how deep you are.

25:23.200 --> 25:26.476
You'll be lucky if you understand this.

25:26.560 --> 25:29.757
- My depth is immaterial to this.
- Oh, you see?

25:30.760 --> 25:32.955
No more beer for you.

25:33.520 --> 25:38.036
I'm sorry, sir, but I have to agree.
I don't see the connection.

25:38.120 --> 25:44.514
All right, that does it. You know, the entire
VHS collection was going to one of you.

25:44.600 --> 25:47.034
It's going to Siler. He gets it.

25:47.120 --> 25:49.270
(knock at door)

25:49.360 --> 25:51.396
Thank God. Pizza.

25:58.560 --> 26:02.633
- Well, you're not the usual delivery boy.
- Is this a good time?

26:02.720 --> 26:05.439
It's always a good time
for you, sir. Come on in.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.988
Let me get you a chair.

26:09.120 --> 26:11.156
General.

26:11.240 --> 26:13.959
At ease, Major, please.

26:14.040 --> 26:16.918
There you go, sir.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.560
I'm glad to find you all here.

26:20.640 --> 26:23.438
You wouldn't happen
to have another one of those?

26:23.520 --> 26:27.832
I would. I hope you like Guinness, sir.

26:27.920 --> 26:31.629
I find it a refreshing substitute for...

26:32.800 --> 26:34.791
food.

26:38.960 --> 26:41.315
I've been relieved of command.

26:45.360 --> 26:46.349
What?

26:46.440 --> 26:52.470
The president has effectively shut down
the SGC for a three-month review process.

26:52.560 --> 26:54.710
- Three months?
- During which time,

26:54.800 --> 26:59.078
a newly-formed government department
will take the place of Stargate Command.

26:59.160 --> 27:02.436
But, sir, the colonel -
we don't have much time.

27:02.520 --> 27:05.239
How could this happen?

27:05.320 --> 27:07.038
Kinsey.

27:07.120 --> 27:10.351
Does anyone know anyone
who voted for those two shrubs?

27:10.440 --> 27:13.193
I've known Hayes for a long time.
He's a good man.

27:13.280 --> 27:15.840
Despite his taste
in running mates, maybe.

27:15.920 --> 27:18.832
Robert Kinsey brought in
a lot of campaign financing,

27:18.920 --> 27:23.869
and, for all we know, he may have used
his knowledge of the Stargate as leverage

27:23.960 --> 27:26.269
to get himself a place on the ticket.

27:26.360 --> 27:29.352
- It doesn't matter now.
- We're gonna lie down for this?

27:29.440 --> 27:31.556
We've been in this situation before.

27:31.640 --> 27:34.916
No. This time it's different.

27:36.040 --> 27:38.349
Who's replacing you, sir?

27:38.440 --> 27:42.274
- Her name is Dr Elizabeth Weir.
- A civilian?

27:42.360 --> 27:47.070
I've heard of her.
She's an expert in international politics.

27:47.160 --> 27:52.075
She mediated high-level UN negotiations. I
referenced her in our treaty for the Tok'ra.

27:52.160 --> 27:56.756
I've been ordered to Washington to
discuss reassignment. I leave tomorrow.

27:56.840 --> 28:02.949
Uh, General, we do have a little
unfinished business here.

28:03.040 --> 28:06.555
As far as I know, you're to report
to work as scheduled on Monday.

28:06.640 --> 28:09.279
- Something must be done.
- I have my orders.

28:09.360 --> 28:14.229
Besides, I have a feeling I may be able to
do more from Washington than I can here.

28:14.320 --> 28:15.833
In the meantime?

28:15.920 --> 28:19.754
You'll just have to plead your case
to the new administration.

28:19.840 --> 28:23.116
I have every confidence in you people.

28:48.120 --> 28:50.111
Amazing, isn't it?

28:50.200 --> 28:52.350
I don't really care.

28:52.440 --> 28:54.351
OK.

28:54.440 --> 28:56.396
Wait.

28:56.480 --> 29:01.600
There's gonna be a lot of changes. Not
everyone's gonna be happy about them.

29:01.680 --> 29:04.319
Yes. I'm about to step into one myself.

29:04.400 --> 29:05.958
OK. Bye.

29:06.040 --> 29:10.397
Sorry. I walk around with this. I look
like a crazy person, talking to myself.

29:10.480 --> 29:14.155
- Elizabeth Weir.
- Daniel Jackson.

29:14.240 --> 29:17.949
I can't get used to being underground.
I keep looking for a window.

29:18.040 --> 29:20.713
I see you found the one
with the best view.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.268
When we first tried
to get the Stargate to work,

29:23.360 --> 29:26.238
I would come here
and just stare at it for hours.

29:26.320 --> 29:31.553
Is that a gentle reminder that you've
been a part of this since the beginning?

29:31.640 --> 29:33.835
- Subtle, huh?
- Hm.

29:38.160 --> 29:41.789
- So, a little light reading?
- Uh...

29:41.880 --> 29:44.758
I've been awake all weekend.

29:46.320 --> 29:49.949
The reality of this is...
it's an adrenaline rush.

29:50.040 --> 29:53.396
Hey, at least I know
you have a beating heart.

29:54.440 --> 29:57.079
I don't expect a warm welcome
from the military.

29:57.160 --> 30:01.517
You're replacing a great man,
uniform notwithstanding.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.318
OK.

30:03.400 --> 30:08.428
But I'm hoping you, of all people,
won't jump to conclusions.

30:08.520 --> 30:12.354
- Like, why someone like you is here.
- Someone like me?

30:12.440 --> 30:17.036
You started out as a political activist,
lobbying against spending on the military.

30:17.120 --> 30:20.954
And how I end up working
for those I was criticising? I know.

30:21.040 --> 30:25.033
But I've decided that the best way
to stop the proliferation of weapons

30:25.120 --> 30:27.953
is to try and end the need for them.

30:28.040 --> 30:32.033
So I'm gonna be the voice of reason
to whoever will listen.

30:32.120 --> 30:37.831
And you think that's why the president
chose you to take over the SGC?

30:40.480 --> 30:44.359
I don't know why I've been given this job.
I really don't.

30:44.440 --> 30:47.910
But I'm gonna do it to the best
of my ability as long as I'm here.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.356
- I'll examine the mandate.
- Don't underestimate the threat.

30:51.440 --> 30:56.275
I'm not. This country's history of Manifest
Destiny cannot continue out to the galaxy.

30:56.360 --> 30:59.591
Especially when this is all
behind the back of the planet.

30:59.680 --> 31:01.750
I'm not saying everything here is right.

31:01.840 --> 31:05.116
We have no right to play God,
but neither do the Goa'uld.

31:05.200 --> 31:11.435
I know none of this may seem real to you
on paper, but, trust me, they're pure evil.

31:11.520 --> 31:15.798
Now, if they had the chance, they would
either destroy us or enslave us all.

31:15.880 --> 31:18.553
You can read as many
mission reports as you want,

31:18.640 --> 31:21.154
but before you decide
what should be done here,

31:21.240 --> 31:25.836
why don't you go through that gate
and see what's going on for yourself?

31:25.920 --> 31:29.037
- In good time.
- We may not have good time.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.633
O'Neill doesn't.

31:30.720 --> 31:34.713
I want you to know, O'Neill's current
condition is of serious concern to me.

31:34.800 --> 31:39.271
You realise Jack did what he did because
it was our only way to find the Lost City?

31:39.360 --> 31:42.033
(PA) Unscheduled incoming traveller.

31:43.520 --> 31:46.910
All the offworld teams are back already.

31:49.920 --> 31:53.435
We're receiving Master Bra'tac's
personal identification code.

31:53.520 --> 31:56.910
- I know what a IDC is.
- He's an ally, and if we don't open the...

31:57.000 --> 32:00.151
I understand that. Thank you.
Go ahead, please.

32:20.240 --> 32:22.117
Bra'tac.

32:25.640 --> 32:29.952
This is Dr Elizabeth Weir.
She's the new leader of this facility.

32:30.040 --> 32:31.439
Hello.

32:31.520 --> 32:34.080
Has Hammond of Texas fallen in battle?

32:34.160 --> 32:36.230
No, sir, he's fine.

32:36.320 --> 32:40.359
We've had some recent changes
in our political leaders.

32:40.440 --> 32:42.431
I see.

32:46.080 --> 32:48.116
Bra'tac, what's wrong?

32:49.800 --> 32:52.234
I am afraid I am not
the bearer of good news.

32:52.320 --> 32:55.437
We have had word
from Jaffa loyal to our cause.

32:55.520 --> 32:59.274
Anubis is gathering
the full force of his fleet.

32:59.360 --> 33:02.750
He will be here within three days.

33:12.400 --> 33:17.190
Bob, could we stop complaining and
start figuring out what we're going to do?

33:17.280 --> 33:21.034
- Mr President? General Hammond.
- Show him in.

33:21.120 --> 33:25.432
We can't ignore a threat of this magnitude.
Hear the man out.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.073
Well, whatever he is.
And get back to me.

33:32.720 --> 33:35.314
General George Hammond.

33:35.400 --> 33:38.073
Mr President.

33:38.160 --> 33:40.754
It was lieutenant
last time we spoke, wasn't it?

33:40.840 --> 33:44.037
For both of us.
That was a lot of hair ago, sir.

33:45.040 --> 33:47.031
Sit down.

33:51.440 --> 33:55.558
When I took this job, I thought I had
the weight of the world on my shoulders.

33:55.640 --> 33:57.915
But then I found out
what you do for a living.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.389
Yes, sir.

34:00.480 --> 34:02.835
This had nothing to do with your record.

34:02.920 --> 34:06.435
If the American people knew
what your contribution was...

34:06.520 --> 34:11.355
Thank you, sir. That's kind of you to say.
One day, maybe they will.

34:14.280 --> 34:17.112
- Dr Weir, she's as smart as they come.
- I hope so.

34:17.199 --> 34:20.829
Poor thing, she has no idea
what she's gotten herself into.

34:20.920 --> 34:24.117
But I had no choice, George.
I had to do something.

34:24.199 --> 34:28.876
I want you to know that I'm aware
of your history with the vice president.

34:28.960 --> 34:31.713
- Yes, sir.
- Hell, we both know why I picked Kinsey.

34:31.800 --> 34:36.510
More than the money. He delivered
Florida all by himself. If I knew then...

34:36.600 --> 34:38.750
Of course.

34:39.760 --> 34:42.877
So, let's talk about your reassignment.

34:44.719 --> 34:47.029
I was thinking more of retirement, sir.

34:47.120 --> 34:51.989
I don't think so, George. Not just yet.
I wanna keep you around Washington.

34:52.080 --> 34:55.117
We're gonna need you and your expertise.

34:57.480 --> 35:01.632
Three days from now is a Thursday.
Thursday's not good for us.

35:01.720 --> 35:03.358
Why now?

35:03.440 --> 35:06.318
Anubis believes we know
the location of the Lost City.

35:06.400 --> 35:08.391
- We don't.
- Not yet.

35:08.480 --> 35:11.631
- But he doesn't know that we don't know.
- (Kinsey) Well.

35:11.720 --> 35:14.678
Some people just
don't know when to leave.

35:14.760 --> 35:18.673
Colonel O'Neill. Major Carter. Teal'c.

35:19.640 --> 35:22.359
These are strange circumstances
to be meeting...

35:22.440 --> 35:25.432
And you are...?

35:26.160 --> 35:29.118
I am Dr Elizabeth Weir, Colonel.

35:29.200 --> 35:33.671
You can just call her your one hope of
ever stepping through the Stargate again.

35:33.760 --> 35:35.796
Bit of a mouthful.

35:35.880 --> 35:39.475
I know I'm playing catch-up,
but I understand time is short.

35:39.560 --> 35:41.949
Actually, it's all relative, ma'am.

35:42.040 --> 35:46.113
Carter could explain it better,
if we had more time.

35:46.640 --> 35:49.438
Shall we have a seat, then?

35:51.600 --> 35:56.071
- This is a situation of grave importance.
- She's quick.

35:56.160 --> 36:01.234
Which is why I've taken it upon myself
to come and hear Mr Bra'tac personally.

36:01.320 --> 36:04.312
Master Bra'tac. Master.

36:04.920 --> 36:07.718
I beg your pardon.

36:09.680 --> 36:16.279
So you believe the Goa'uld Anubis
is planning to attack?

36:16.360 --> 36:19.591
You may be certain of it.

36:19.680 --> 36:22.717
I'll say this - the timing is impeccable.

36:23.440 --> 36:27.433
The moment we suspend Stargate
operations, you pull this out of your hat.

36:27.520 --> 36:33.277
Mr Vice President, if you're suggesting
that we'd make something like this up...

36:33.360 --> 36:37.876
- That's exactly what I'm suggesting.
- Well, that is exactly what we do.

36:37.960 --> 36:42.272
We sit around on our fat asses and create
scenarios that put the planet at risk.

36:42.360 --> 36:45.432
- That's what we do.
- I think you'd do about anything.

36:45.520 --> 36:47.192
(Elizabeth) Gentlemen.

36:47.280 --> 36:52.559
Let's assume that Master Bra'tac
is in earnest and that the threat is real.

36:52.640 --> 36:57.031
Do you know what the threat is? Anubis
is half-Goa'uld, half-ascended Ancient,

36:57.120 --> 37:01.557
with the knowledge and technology
to wipe us all from the face of the Earth.

37:01.640 --> 37:06.555
- What about negotiating?
- For crying out loud, that's derentis.

37:11.800 --> 37:14.360
- What?
- You just said "derentis".

37:15.160 --> 37:18.550
- Did not.
- Did too.

37:18.640 --> 37:20.949
- "Derentis", what is that?
- Latin?

37:21.040 --> 37:24.032
- It's not.
- I think what he is trying to say is that,

37:24.120 --> 37:27.795
based on our past experiences,
negotiating would be insane. Crazy.

37:27.880 --> 37:29.393
- I got that.
- However,

37:29.480 --> 37:34.838
we believe there may be alien technology
within our reach that could defeat Anubis.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.388
Now you're pulling a ray gun
out of your hat?

37:37.480 --> 37:40.916
Weapons capable of defending this planet.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.560
I can't believe we're listening to this.

37:43.640 --> 37:45.870
Mr Vice President, on his last...

37:45.960 --> 37:50.670
I am aware of the events that have,
once again, compromised

37:50.760 --> 37:53.911
Colonel O'Neill's invaluable judgement.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.992
And the fact that
on his last official mission,

37:57.080 --> 38:01.392
he has incurred the wrath of humanity's
worst enemy on behalf of us all...

38:01.480 --> 38:07.157
Wait a minute. I thought you didn't
buy into the whole invasion thing.

38:07.240 --> 38:10.676
The fact is, until we know
the location of the Lost City...

38:10.760 --> 38:12.910
I know where it is.

38:14.120 --> 38:17.112
You know where it is now?

38:17.200 --> 38:20.875
I will. It's in there somewhere.

38:25.160 --> 38:28.038
Look, let me make this simple.

38:28.120 --> 38:31.317
I come up with the Lost City,
we go find it. Yes or no?

38:31.400 --> 38:33.391
No!

38:37.240 --> 38:40.357
Who are you, really?

38:40.440 --> 38:43.113
And why are you here?

38:43.200 --> 38:46.510
I will consider it.

38:47.920 --> 38:50.673
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

38:54.520 --> 38:56.954
I must return to Chulak.

38:57.040 --> 38:59.349
I, too, will go.

38:59.440 --> 39:03.638
In the hope of procuring ships
and warriors to defend this world.

39:03.720 --> 39:05.711
Good luck.

39:26.080 --> 39:29.516
- What the hell was that?
- I'm sorry?

39:29.600 --> 39:31.989
You don't know O'Neill like I do.

39:33.960 --> 39:36.679
This is my call. Colonel O'Neill...

39:36.760 --> 39:39.911
- Is the one who got us into this mess.
- I don't see...

39:40.000 --> 39:44.118
I want him gone. I want them all gone.
You haven't figured that out yet?

39:44.200 --> 39:49.752
- Oh, I've figured out quite a bit.
- Well, hallelujah for that.

39:49.840 --> 39:53.150
This is my office. This is my chair.

39:53.240 --> 39:56.915
Until I'm told otherwise,
I'm gonna make decisions as I see fit.

39:57.000 --> 40:00.913
- Not as they fit into your agenda.
- You have no idea what my agenda is.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.878
Whatever your agenda is.

40:04.800 --> 40:10.796
You don't know anything. If you think
you do, you're not as smart as I thought.

40:22.000 --> 40:27.154
So, T... if I don't see you again.

40:27.240 --> 40:31.392
- I will see you soon, O'Neill.
- You know something I don't?

40:31.480 --> 40:35.712
In fact, it is you that
knows something that I do not.

40:35.800 --> 40:38.360
Hope you're right.

40:50.800 --> 40:53.234
I wish you all well.

41:29.800 --> 41:33.395
- Does this mean anything to you?
- No.

41:33.480 --> 41:39.715
- Could you at least look at it?
- Daniel, I don't speak Ancient. Yet.

41:39.800 --> 41:43.349
And when I do, eventually,
you know I'll never understand it.

41:43.440 --> 41:45.271
You have to try.

41:45.360 --> 41:47.954
Last time, things just popped into my fron.

41:48.040 --> 41:51.953
- Fron is "head".
- I have no idea what you're talking about.

41:52.040 --> 41:54.998
Maybe if you stopped working on
this stupid crossword.

41:55.080 --> 41:58.470
I'd like to at least finish that while I can.

41:59.520 --> 42:02.239
- I thought...
- 13 across, you wrote "taonas".

42:02.320 --> 42:05.073
Yeah, so? What's it mean?

42:05.160 --> 42:09.119
I don't know, you tell me.
Eight down, you wrote "praclarush".

42:09.200 --> 42:11.794
What's eight down?

42:11.880 --> 42:18.035
"Label". There's empty spaces. I think the
answer is supposed to be "identification".

42:18.120 --> 42:21.157
13 across is "sphere".

42:21.240 --> 42:23.515
Jack, this is it.

42:24.640 --> 42:28.952
See, I assume we still speak
the same language. Mostly.

42:29.040 --> 42:31.190
Sphere, planet. Label, name.

42:31.280 --> 42:34.431
- Following still you not.
- Praclarush Taonas.

42:34.520 --> 42:40.789
You wrote the name of the planet where
we'll find the Lost City in the crossword.

42:40.880 --> 42:44.350
- Bit of a jump.
- Why else would you do that?

42:45.560 --> 42:49.917
The clue for seven down is "celestial
body". And he wrote "Uma Thurman".

42:50.000 --> 42:52.116
Yes.

42:53.520 --> 42:56.034
It has to mean something.

42:56.120 --> 42:58.111
It does.

43:01.800 --> 43:02.949
(sighs)

43:05.720 --> 43:07.915
I'm hungry.

43:15.240 --> 43:17.959
Praclarush Taonas.

43:18.040 --> 43:23.114
According to this, it means "lost in fire".
This has to be the planet of the Lost City.

43:23.200 --> 43:29.548
Knowing the name of the planet doesn't
help, unless we have a gate address.

43:44.320 --> 43:46.550
Jack, what are you doing?

43:48.400 --> 43:50.436
- At.
- What?

43:51.680 --> 43:52.829
At.

43:52.920 --> 43:54.319
- This?
- That.

43:54.400 --> 43:57.312
- That is at?
- You can stop that.

43:57.400 --> 44:01.678
- Don't ask what it means, I don't know.
- I think I do.

44:10.640 --> 44:13.837
- What's this?
- Sh!

44:16.080 --> 44:18.878
- Well?
- You just told us to be quiet.

44:18.960 --> 44:22.953
No. When I look at this, I think "Sh".

44:23.800 --> 44:26.678
- That's it.
- What?

44:29.920 --> 44:32.957
"Praclarush Taonas". Six syllables.

44:33.480 --> 44:36.552
What if each symbol on
the Stargate has a sound?

44:36.640 --> 44:40.349
- Like an alphabet?
- Praclarush Taonas isn't just the name.

44:40.440 --> 44:43.000
It's also the gate address.

44:48.280 --> 44:52.558
At is the Earth's symbol.
Our point of origin.

44:52.640 --> 44:54.790
Praclarush Taonas At.

44:54.880 --> 44:58.111
- So this would lead us to the Lost City.
- It has to.

44:58.200 --> 45:00.270
Wait a minute.

45:00.360 --> 45:04.273
We dialled this address two years ago,
but couldn't establish a wormhole.

45:04.360 --> 45:06.828
- The gate must be buried.
- Lost in fire.

45:06.920 --> 45:09.070
What we need could still be there.

45:09.160 --> 45:13.915
I could use the address to calculate the
planet's location, but we'll need a ship.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.672
Prometheus.

45:15.760 --> 45:19.355
But with Anubis on his way,
Prometheus is our last line of defence.

45:19.440 --> 45:22.079
Maybe Teal'c has something by now.

45:22.160 --> 45:24.720
Where's Colonel O'Neill?

45:25.840 --> 45:27.273
Packing.

45:29.600 --> 45:31.955
- Colonel.
- Don't ask.

45:32.040 --> 45:35.077
The last time, he just did things
without knowing why.

45:35.160 --> 45:38.311
It's a good sign.
It means we're on the right track.

45:38.400 --> 45:41.233
- Sir?
- I don't know, Carter.

45:46.280 --> 45:49.272
Grab a naqahdah generator, will ya?

46:06.360 --> 46:08.715
I am Ronan.

46:08.800 --> 46:11.234
I knew your father.

46:11.320 --> 46:13.390
It is an honour.

46:18.200 --> 46:21.590
- I have a ship at my disposal.
- So we have heard.

46:21.680 --> 46:24.433
Forgive me, but, as brave as you are,

46:24.520 --> 46:28.069
you cannot hope to stop
the fleet of Anubis with just one ship.

46:28.160 --> 46:30.196
I have seen the extent of his forces.

46:30.280 --> 46:34.114
We only wish to use your ship to help us
find something much more powerful.

46:34.200 --> 46:38.512
Something that we believe
will defeat Anubis once and for all.

46:38.600 --> 46:42.149
If that is true, then I will join you.

46:44.640 --> 46:47.029
That is my only condition.

46:50.280 --> 46:54.034
- I am a fine pilot.
- So we have heard.

47:00.640 --> 47:05.156
Have you got everything you need?
I think there's still the sink in the kitchen.

47:05.240 --> 47:07.117
Was that a joke?

47:07.200 --> 47:09.589
Perhaps. A bad one.

47:09.680 --> 47:11.989
Yes, very bad.

47:12.080 --> 47:14.514
But I sense hope for you.

47:14.600 --> 47:19.515
Well, I hope for all of us that you find
what you're looking for, Colonel.

47:19.600 --> 47:21.591
Thank you.

47:45.240 --> 47:46.468
What?

47:46.560 --> 47:48.869
I would have done it, you know.

47:51.280 --> 47:54.750
- I know.
- There has to be a way to reverse it.

47:54.840 --> 47:57.752
Once we have what we need.

47:57.840 --> 48:00.673
We'll find a way.

48:04.640 --> 48:09.031
We're coaxing everything out of
the engines, but we're still two days away.

48:09.120 --> 48:12.192
- How you feeling, sir?
- A bit cruvis.

48:13.600 --> 48:16.273
A little fron ache.

48:21.480 --> 48:23.789
We need to go faster.

48:38.760 --> 48:40.398
A short time ago,

48:40.480 --> 48:44.314
our radar detected three Goa'uld
vessels emerging from hyperspace.

48:44.400 --> 48:46.436
Looks like you were wrong, Bob.

48:46.520 --> 48:50.399
Three Goa'uld ships is hardly
the full force of Anubis's fleet.

48:50.480 --> 48:52.630
It sounds to me like Anubis wants to know

48:52.720 --> 48:56.349
if SG-1 was successful in
procuring Ancient defence technology.

48:56.440 --> 48:59.671
- They weren't.
- Not yet, but Anubis doesn't know.

48:59.760 --> 49:04.231
He's most likely holding back his invasion
fleet till he finds out what we've got.

49:04.320 --> 49:08.552
Sir, Prometheus and our fleet of 302s
can give them a run for their money.

49:08.640 --> 49:12.394
- If that's all he throws at us, I agree.
- Then let's do it.

49:12.480 --> 49:15.472
However, Mr President,
I agree with your assessment.

49:15.560 --> 49:20.111
Anubis wants to goad us into a precipitous
action which will show our hand.

49:20.200 --> 49:24.318
I believe launching the Prometheus now
will only serve to demonstrate

49:24.400 --> 49:29.269
we lack the very advanced weaponry
Anubis is afraid of.

49:30.880 --> 49:33.269
Remain at DEFCON 3 for the time being,

49:33.360 --> 49:37.956
but contact the governments of Russia,
Great Britain, France, China and Canada.

49:38.040 --> 49:40.031
Let 'em know what we think we're in for.

49:40.120 --> 49:44.352
In the meantime,
I better prepare a hell of a speech.

49:44.440 --> 49:46.317
Thank you.

49:57.520 --> 49:59.511
Gimme your zat.

50:10.720 --> 50:13.553
There you go.

50:13.640 --> 50:15.471
Sir,

50:15.560 --> 50:19.439
you should know that General Hammond
authorised me to take command...

50:19.520 --> 50:22.114
- Do it now.
- I don't think that's necessary.

50:22.200 --> 50:24.430
I trust you.

50:24.520 --> 50:26.829
I'll make it easy for you.

50:26.920 --> 50:30.071
I resign. You're in charge.

50:30.800 --> 50:32.518
OK.

50:33.600 --> 50:38.628
At your house, before Daniel and Teal'c
showed up, what I was gonna say was...

50:38.720 --> 50:40.711
I know.

51:04.840 --> 51:10.198
My lord. The advance Ha'tak reports
that they have received no challenge.

51:10.280 --> 51:13.317
Order them to begin the attack.

51:13.400 --> 51:18.349
If the Tauri have weapons
of the Ancients, we shall see.

51:35.400 --> 51:40.394
This doesn't look good. The surface is
almost completely covered by lava flows.

51:40.480 --> 51:42.550
How could there have been a civilisation?

51:42.640 --> 51:45.791
A star becomes a red giant
near the end of its life.

51:45.880 --> 51:48.952
A million years ago, this planet
may have looked like Earth.

51:49.040 --> 51:51.873
- So we're a million years late?
- Probably more.

51:51.960 --> 51:53.916
That's very late.

51:57.720 --> 51:59.711
What?

52:07.120 --> 52:09.998
I have scanned the entire surface.

52:11.160 --> 52:14.311
What do you want me to say?
I don't even know why we're here.

52:14.400 --> 52:17.358
But you did pack the hazmat suits for us.

52:17.440 --> 52:21.228
You knew the condition of the planet
and that we would have to go there.

52:21.320 --> 52:25.313
- Then you know more than I do.
- No, sir. I don't.

52:25.400 --> 52:27.789
Sit down and take a look.

52:30.160 --> 52:32.833
That's an order.

52:39.880 --> 52:41.677
Easy.

52:55.520 --> 52:57.829
Taonas.

52:57.920 --> 53:00.229
- Sir?
- What?

53:00.320 --> 53:03.915
You looked at the screen
and said "Taonas".

53:05.400 --> 53:07.789
- If you say so.
- You say so.

53:12.360 --> 53:16.194
There's a small anomaly
on the surface here. Like a bubble.

53:16.280 --> 53:18.635
Is it a cavern?

53:18.720 --> 53:22.190
It looks like a perfectly-formed
half-sphere of molten rock.

53:22.280 --> 53:25.238
Perhaps a force field for
the city was covered over.

53:25.320 --> 53:29.518
Too small to have a city in there.
We aren't getting energy readings from it.

53:29.600 --> 53:31.955
Perhaps the shield has since failed.

53:32.040 --> 53:34.918
We should still check it out.

53:38.120 --> 53:41.078
We've managed to contact
the captain of the Spruance,

53:41.160 --> 53:43.754
a destroyer in the Nimitz battle group.

53:43.840 --> 53:46.115
(captain) Some beam came outta the sky.

53:46.200 --> 53:50.398
There wasn't any warning, but
the entire carrierjust went up in a fireball.

53:50.480 --> 53:52.789
- Captain, can you see the enemy?
- Holy!

53:52.880 --> 53:57.192
Another cruiserjust blew up.
Where the hell's the fire coming from?

53:57.280 --> 54:00.272
(connection crackles and dies)

54:11.440 --> 54:14.750
The engagement began
less than five minutes ago.

54:14.840 --> 54:18.196
And that was only one Goa'uld ship.

54:33.440 --> 54:38.389
Here, the crust may be thin enough
for the rings to penetrate.

54:38.480 --> 54:40.471
Stand by.

54:53.160 --> 54:57.358
- Can you still hear us?
- (Teal'c) Indeed. Loudly and clearly.

54:57.440 --> 55:01.718
We will move a safe distance,
and return on your signal.

55:04.200 --> 55:06.555
(Carter) The radiation level's high.

55:06.640 --> 55:12.556
(Teal'c) I believe Ronan was correct.
A shield once protected this structure.

55:12.640 --> 55:16.269
(Carter) It's possible the rings
compromise the dome's integrity.

55:16.360 --> 55:20.433
(Daniel) Too bad.
Otherwise, it's very pleasant.

55:50.720 --> 55:56.875
(Daniel) Architecture definitely indicates
this was built by the Ancients.

55:56.960 --> 56:00.555
(Teal'c) This facility
does not appear operational.

56:00.640 --> 56:06.431
(Carter) I don't know about you guys,
but I'm hoping this isn't the Lost City.

56:07.920 --> 56:10.195
Sir, be careful.

56:13.640 --> 56:17.110
Jack, you sure you know
what you're doing?

56:30.880 --> 56:33.474
The atmosphere is safe.

56:59.480 --> 57:01.948
(Carter) It's a map of the galaxy.

57:02.040 --> 57:06.909
Looks like every planet the Ancients
ever colonised is indicated here.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.798
This is where we are - Praclarush.

57:13.200 --> 57:15.430
That's our solar system.

57:16.480 --> 57:20.917
- Earth.
- That does not appear to be Earth.

57:21.000 --> 57:25.994
It doesn't take into consideration
the 30 million years of continental drift.

57:26.080 --> 57:28.753
Sir, why are you showing us this?

57:31.680 --> 57:33.671
Jack?

57:36.400 --> 57:38.072
Terre Atlantus.

57:38.160 --> 57:40.799
"Terre" is Earth. Atlantis.

57:40.880 --> 57:44.077
The Lost City of Atlantis?

57:45.040 --> 57:49.238
Are you saying
the Lost City of the Ancients is here?

57:51.440 --> 57:53.351
Antarctica.

57:53.440 --> 57:55.670
Subo glaciuse.

57:55.760 --> 58:01.278
"Under the ice." The city we've been
looking for is under the ice of Antarctica.

58:01.360 --> 58:03.954
It's been on Earth the whole time?

58:05.040 --> 58:06.519
We were there.

58:06.600 --> 58:10.275
We came all this way just to find out
that we have to go all the way back.

58:10.360 --> 58:11.713
No.

58:38.040 --> 58:40.679
(Carter) A power source.

58:43.400 --> 58:45.391
Bra'tac, we're on our way.

58:45.480 --> 58:48.711
We know the location of the Lost City.
It's on Earth.

58:49.040 --> 58:51.474
Understood, Major Carter.

58:51.560 --> 58:55.348
Pilot the vessel.
I will see to the transport rings.

58:55.440 --> 58:57.431
(gasps)

58:59.680 --> 59:01.955
I am betrayed.

59:02.040 --> 59:05.953
You are the betrayer
of your one true god, Anubis.

59:12.880 --> 59:16.475
You should have struck
for my heart, Ronan.

59:16.560 --> 59:18.676
You will die more slowly this way.

59:18.760 --> 59:22.514
You are mistaken.
I no longer carry a symbiote.

59:36.880 --> 59:39.394
(Daniel) I don't think
the dome's gonna hold.

59:42.920 --> 59:45.798
You are weak, old man.

59:52.080 --> 59:55.675
(Carter) Bra'tac,
what's happening up there?

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:08.391
You may be younger, but not the wiser.

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.510
Bra'tac, the dome is collapsing.

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.631
(gasps)

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:43.718
(Bra'tac) Secure the ship.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:57.548
Ronan was an agent of Anubis.

01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:00.108
Save your strength, old friend.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:07.038
You know that I am stubborn, Teal'c,
but this battle I fear I cannot win.

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:44.711
The pain is fading.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.311
Jack!

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:03.753
Once more, I am in your debt.

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.831
But how?

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:09.117
O'Neill possesses
the healing power of the Ancients.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:14.194
I guess your condition's
a little more advanced than last time.

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:17.397
Teal'c, set a course for Earth.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:30.672
Our F/A-22s and ABLs are all in the air, but
so far there's been nothing to intercept.

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:34.309
Since the battle group was destroyed,
the Goa'uld haven't fired.

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:37.358
Why not a city or two?
Just to prove his point.

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:39.590
(whirring)

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.672
Hold your fire! It's a hologram.

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.070
I am Anubis.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:06.552
- You've got to be kidding.
- You are the leader of this world.

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:10.713
Henry Hayes.
President of the United States of America.

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.268
One nation among many.

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:16.955
No more. Bow before your god.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.395
I don't think so.

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:23.472
However, I am willing
to discuss your surrender.

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:28.509
If you possessed weapons matching
mine, you would have used them.

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:31.512
Don't let the suit fool ya, fella.
We're gonna fight.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.955
You bring destruction upon yourselves.

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:36.110
Never going to happen.

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:44.638
Too much?

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:58.596
OK.

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:04.869
Sir, 30-plus ships just appeared in orbit,
taking station around the planet.

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:11.358
He didn't buy it.

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:14.512
It's time to go to the Alpha site.
You can stay in contact...

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:17.478
Bob, go ahead.

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:21.439
- Mr President...
- No, no. Go ahead. I'm staying.

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:34.029
You're all welcome to join him.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:37.874
I think you know
we're staying here with you, sir.

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:43.431
- George, you deserve the right to go.
- No, sir. I think I'll stay as well.

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:45.192
Good.

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:49.353
If you'll accept it,
I've got another job for you.

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:10.229
Are you preparing
a weapon for battle, O'Neill?

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:17.276
Sensors have detected an armada
of Goa'uld ships in orbit around Earth.

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:23.876
Can you understand anything
that I'm saying, O'Neill?

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.588
O'Neill.

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:38.240
I wish for you to know that...

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:08.233
Mr President, in the last two hours,
the enemy has focused on

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:12.916
systematically taking out power grids
and broadcast terminals around the globe.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.993
They seem to wanna
disable our communications.

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:21.077
So much for my speech.

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:24.038
We're doing our best
to get the word out to the public.

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:25.758
Saying what?

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:29.355
For the moment
we're sticking with a meteor shower.

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:35.276
That'll only hold up as long as those ships
stay out of range. Go to DEFCON 1.

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:39.273
John, launch Prometheus.

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:51.949
I thought you were a lot of things.
A coward wasn't one of them.

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:54.110
I'm a pragmatist, Doctor.

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:58.671
Someone has to ensure the survival of the
human race and the American way of live.

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:02.753
By the way, if you survive, you're through.

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.436
- What's going on?
- We've lost power.

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:11.308
- Get it back!
- Manual Iris control. Close it, now.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:20.634
What do you think you're doing?
Open that Iris and dial the Alpha site.

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:24.156
Unauthorised offworld activation.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.878
(explosion)

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:29.912
- That was a nuke. Or worse.
- Anubis has dialled in.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.276
- You're not going anywhere.
- Get me out of here. You hear me?

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:37.399
- Just received a message from SG-1.
- It's not coming through the gate.

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:41.109
- I don't give a damn!
- Well, I do!

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.195
Dr Weir.

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:47.068
Mr President, Prometheus can't win
against an entire Goa'uld fleet,

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:50.232
but it could buy SG-1
time to complete their mission.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:56.475
Mr President, that is downright insane.
I am relieving Dr Weir, taking command...

01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:01.680
- Sir, from what I've looked at...
- Will you shut the hell up?

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:04.035
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Not you, Doctor.

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:06.398
Excuse me?

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:09.790
- Consider your resignation accepted.
- You can't do that.

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:12.474
Oh, please.
I got enough on you to have you shot.

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:15.358
This is the biggest mistake
you will ever make.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:20.229
But I think I'll stick with my original
thought, which is, shut the hell up.

01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:22.959
I promise, you will only live to regret this.

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.349
- (door slams)
- Go ahead, Dr Weir.

01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:31.354
I believe, sir, sending Prometheus
to cover SG-1 is our best hope.

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:36.473
We have our orders.
Let's get this bird in the air.

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:41.509
Set inertial compensators and shields
at maximum. Initiate launch sequence.

01:08:54.479 --> 01:08:58.439
Jack's modifying the transmitter.
We'll use it to bore a hole through the ice.

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:02.115
- We must first defeat the forces of Anubis.
- How we gonna do that?

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:05.475
You must exit hyperspace
close to the Earth's atmosphere.

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:10.839
- To be on the other side of the armada.
- There won't be much time to decelerate.

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:14.229
Of that I am aware, old friend.

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:32.870
- Teal'c, you're gonna pull up, right?
- I am attempting to do so.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.509
Where now?

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:58.277
It has to be near the coordinates
where we found the second Stargate.

01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:19.354
My lord.

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:24.195
A scout ship has exited hyperspace and
is heading for the planet's southern pole.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.594
Sir, how long is this gonna take?

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:59.275
- Anubis cannot have missed our arrival.
- You are correct.

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:02.432
Al-kesh and gliders approach. Many.

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:09.429
They will be in firing range in 30 seconds.

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:18.035
More ships approaching
from the opposite direction.

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:22.716
- Sir, we're about to get our a...
- They are not Goa'uld.

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:41.919
Defend that scout ship at all cost.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.319
Prometheus.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:46.517
(Hammond) SG-1, this is Hammond.
Do you read?

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:49.034
Yes, sir. It's good to see you.

01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:51.111
Let's go.

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:06.670
Colonel, how are we
gonna get down there?

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:09.154
The rings.

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:12.789
The Ancients built the Stargates,
there must be a set of rings.

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:16.998
The transmission beam
just couldn't penetrate a mile of ice.

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:26.236
- We're taking damage to the outer hull.
- F302s have expended their ordnance.

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:29.471
We can't take them aboard.
They'll have to divert to McMurdo.

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:33.394
- We need to recharge the shields.
- Hold your position.

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:39.594
Ready.

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.632
Good luck.

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:12.468
- We are in range, my lord.
- Fire.

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:17.070
- Shields are failing.
- Scout ship clear.

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:20.311
Set a course for Anubis's mothership.
Move us out of here.

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.709
Main engines on line. Emergency thrust.

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:30.036
Tauri vessel is abandoning its position.

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:40.676
(Carter) This looks vaguely familiar.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.594
Dormata.

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:01.908
"Sleep"?

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.991
(ringing sound)

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:20.352
You are too late.
The power of the Ancients is mine.

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:36.757
Fools.

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:40.360
It's a hologram.

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:29.439
- The human attack vessel approaches.
- Destroy it.

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:56.718
Sir, whatever you're gonna do...

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:03.557
Shields are down.
Weapons are expended.

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.916
- The next hit's gonna take us out.
- Hold your course.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.878
Brace for a collision. If we go, they go.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.312
- Weapons fire coming from the surface.
- Break off course. Get us clear.

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:39.311
Our shields are of no use.

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:44.431
No!

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:55.958
- What the hell was that?
- That was SG-1.

01:17:56.040 --> 01:18:00.875
(man) Thousands of bright yellow... I don't
know, they're coming from the surface.

01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:06.432
They're cutting the enemy fleet to shreds.
My God, it's beautiful.

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:14.111
Sir?

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:16.712
Sir?

01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:20.713
His pulse is erratic.

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:23.234
Don't you dare leave us now. We won.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.991
Colonel!

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.918
Sir, I have the president for you.

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:33.759
Patch him through.

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:39.233
Mr President, I'm confirming the enemy's
been defeated. The threat is eliminated.

01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:42.153
Congratulations, George.

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:47.234
I don't know how we're ever
going to be able to thank you.

01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:53.400
Please, Jack.

01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:00.354
Dormata.

01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:04.031
That thing.

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.634
Now what?

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:29.872
Aveo... amacuse.

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:34.557
Goodbye.

01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:59.959
We can't just leave him like this. There
has to be a way to reverse the process.

01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:04.158
- I don't think this is it, Sam.
- What do you mean?

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:07.152
The dome's too small. It's like Taonas.

01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:10.357
It's obviously not a city.
It's an outpost of some kind.

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:13.398
- This isn't Atlantis?
- I don't think so.

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:20.672
If this is not the Lost City...
then where is it?

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:37.150
