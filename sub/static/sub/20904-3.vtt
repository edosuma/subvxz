00:15.182 --> 00:16.116

00:16.183 --> 00:17.351
<b>- But that's not all.</b>

00:17.417 --> 00:18.685
<b>The shops entering</b>

00:18.752 --> 00:20.521
<b>will have at least one</b>

<b>competed in Season 4:</b>
<b>Bubba Irwin.</b>

00:40.607 --> 00:43.177
<b> <i>announcer: Old Town Ink</i> </b>
<b> <i>immediately made enemies.</i> </b>

00:43.243 --> 00:45.345
<b>- Pulling lines with a mag?</b>
<b>- DJ's using a mag.</b>

00:45.412 --> 00:47.714
<b>- To essentially emulate,</b>
<b>like, five single-line needles.</b>

00:47.781 --> 00:48.916
<b>- Yeah.</b>

00:48.982 --> 00:50.484
<b>- You guys are</b>
<b>bending the rules.</b>

00:50.551 --> 00:52.286
<b>- It's just somebody thought</b>
<b>of it, and you guys didn't.</b>

00:52.352 --> 00:53.887
<b>- We're focused on</b>
<b>every single move you make</b>

00:53.954 --> 00:55.789
<b>to find a reason</b>
<b>to kick you the [bleep] out.</b>

00:55.856 --> 00:59.126
<b>- The jury of peers</b>
<b>nominate Old Town Ink.</b>

00:59.193 --> 01:00.127
<b>- Are you kidding me?</b>

01:00.194 --> 01:01.328
<b>- Technicality, man.</b>

<b> <i>and The Marked Society</i> </b>

<b>am I here right now?</b>

01:10.337 --> 01:11.271
<b>- You look close at this?</b>

01:11.338 --> 01:12.272
<b>- Please do.</b>

01:12.339 --> 01:13.674
<b>- It is lines.</b>

01:13.740 --> 01:15.175
<b>- Every single spot.</b>

01:15.242 --> 01:16.376
<b>- You guys put up somebody</b>
<b>that you're threatened by.</b>

01:16.443 --> 01:17.911
<b>You wasted your [bleep] time.</b>

01:17.978 --> 01:19.346
<b>- Tri-Cities Tattoo...</b>

01:19.413 --> 01:21.448
<b>- You have a lot of</b>
<b>sloppy line work here.</b>

01:21.515 --> 01:23.317
<b>- With ours, you can</b>
<b>at least tell what it is.</b>

01:23.383 --> 01:24.418
<b>- The Marked Society.</b>

01:24.484 --> 01:26.253
<b>- The tiger is jacked.</b>

01:26.320 --> 01:28.088
<b>Anatomy is proving to be</b>
<b>a big issue.</b>

01:28.088 --> 01:30.824

01:30.891 --> 01:33.727

02:59.780 --> 03:01.181
<b>- Absolutely.</b>

03:01.248 --> 03:02.549

03:02.616 --> 03:03.951
<b>take the lead and</b>
<b>do whatever you wanted to do?</b>

03:04.051 --> 03:05.552
<b>Did you want me</b>
<b>to just sit there?</b>

03:05.619 --> 03:07.354
<b>- You could have</b>

03:07.421 --> 03:08.956
<b>- So what are you saying?</b>

03:09.056 --> 03:12.059
<b>I should have just sat there and</b>
<b>just drawn lines? Like, what?</b>

03:12.092 --> 03:14.595
<b>- Like, I'm not used to doing</b>
<b>bad tattoos on the regular.</b>

03:14.661 --> 03:20.400
<b>Like, this doesn't [bleep]</b>
<b>work for me.</b>

<b>the first-ever title</b>

04:00.040 --> 04:02.376
<b>As you know,</b>
<b>every time a shop is eliminated,</b>

04:02.442 --> 04:04.478
<b>another shop</b>
<b>will enter the competition</b>

04:04.545 --> 04:07.047
<b>ready to fight for the title.</b>

04:07.080 --> 04:10.050
<b>The next returning veteran</b>
<b>is from Queens, New York,</b>

04:10.117 --> 04:14.054
<b>and he competed in Season 3.</b>

04:14.087 --> 04:17.791
<b>He's the owner</b>
<b>of Think Before You Ink,</b>

04:17.858 --> 04:21.228
<b>Mr. Made Rich.</b>

04:21.295 --> 04:23.197
<b>- I am here to win,</b>
<b>and if I wasn't here to win,</b>

04:23.263 --> 04:24.798
<b>I would not be here.</b>

04:24.865 --> 04:29.336
<b>We have a strategy, and we're</b>
<b>gonna stick to the [bleep].</b>

04:29.403 --> 04:31.572
<b>- The teeth of the skull,</b>
<b>they're kind of nonexistent.</b>

04:31.638 --> 04:33.373
<b>- Nobody's saying</b>
<b>I had to add teeth.</b>

04:33.440 --> 04:35.943
<b>- Nobody's saying you</b>
<b>have to do a good tattoo at all.</b>

04:36.076 --> 04:38.812
<b>You got two dots for eyes,</b>
<b>the nose is crooked,</b>

04:38.879 --> 04:41.782
<b>the lips are not lined up.</b>
<b>Where's the beauty in this face?</b>

04:41.849 --> 04:44.117
<b>- A lot of Asian work,</b>
<b>there really isn't much detail</b>

04:44.184 --> 04:47.321
<b>in the face at all,</b>
<b>so I've tried to dumb it down.</b>

04:47.387 --> 04:49.590
<b>- Insulting the artwork</b>
<b>that you're doing</b>

04:49.656 --> 04:51.091
<b>because of your inadequacies</b>

04:51.158 --> 04:52.659
<b>only points out</b>
<b>your shortcomings.</b>

04:52.726 --> 04:56.797
<b>- Rich, you do not have</b>
<b>what it takes to be Ink Master.</b>

04:56.864 --> 04:59.166
<b> <i>- I do have more to prove,</i> </b>
<b> <i>being this is my second time.</i> </b>

04:59.233 --> 05:01.301
<b>I have a bigger target</b>
<b>on my back, and I know,</b>

05:01.368 --> 05:03.303
<b> <i>me moving how I move</i> </b>
<b> <i>with my confidence,</i> </b>

05:03.370 --> 05:06.173
<b>the competitors really aren't</b>
<b>gonna like me off the bat.</b>

05:06.240 --> 05:08.242
<b> <i>- I know nothing</i> </b>
<b> <i>about this dude,</i> </b>

05:08.308 --> 05:09.676
<b> <i>but the looks</i> </b>
<b> <i>he's giving everyone,</i> </b>

05:09.743 --> 05:11.678
<b>I think I know everything</b>
<b>about this dude.</b>

05:11.745 --> 05:13.580
<b>- Welcome back, Rich.</b>
<b>Who'd you bring with you?</b>

05:13.647 --> 05:15.382
<b>- Got my man DTatStar with me.</b>

05:15.449 --> 05:16.617
<b>We've been tattooing together</b>

05:16.683 --> 05:17.918
<b>damn near my whole career,</b>

05:18.051 --> 05:19.386
<b>so if there's a pot of</b>
<b>money to get got,</b>

05:19.453 --> 05:20.654
<b>I'm betting on him for the shot.</b>

05:20.721 --> 05:22.189
<b>- Welcome, man.</b>
<b>Thanks for joining us.</b>

05:22.256 --> 05:23.423
<b>- Thanks for having me.</b>

05:23.490 --> 05:25.058
<b> <i>My style is very illustrative,</i> </b>

05:25.058 --> 05:27.794
<b> <i>but I kind of put</i> </b>
<b> <i>my urban spin to things.</i> </b>

05:27.861 --> 05:30.330
<b>We will definitely be</b>
<b>a force to be reckoned with.</b>

05:30.397 --> 05:31.899
<b>- This week's skill is designed</b>

05:31.965 --> 05:34.168
<b>to put your shop</b>
<b>to the ultimate test.</b>

05:34.234 --> 05:37.137
<b>Each week, everyone will</b>
<b>be tested on the skill that</b>

05:37.204 --> 05:39.673
<b>exposes the veteran artist's</b>
<b>shortcomings</b>

05:39.740 --> 05:41.975
<b>from the last time</b>
<b>they competed.</b>

05:42.075 --> 05:46.079
<b>And this week,</b>
<b>we're testing detail.</b>

05:46.113 --> 05:47.748
<b> <i>- The best way to show</i> </b>
<b> <i>detailing in artwork</i> </b>

05:47.814 --> 05:50.817
<b>is to use different colors,</b>
<b>do little different accents,</b>

05:50.884 --> 05:53.253
<b>make little highlights,</b>
<b>mess with the line weights,</b>

05:53.320 --> 05:55.355
<b>just so everything</b>
<b>doesn't look so plain.</b>

05:55.422 --> 05:56.657
<b>- For today's flash challenge,</b>

05:56.723 --> 05:59.359
<b>you must create</b>
<b>not one but two images.</b>

05:59.426 --> 06:01.628
<b>One of you must paint the</b>
<b>left-facing panels</b>

06:01.695 --> 06:03.096
<b>to create one image,</b>

06:03.163 --> 06:05.632
<b>while your teammate</b>
<b>paints the right-facing panels</b>

06:05.699 --> 06:07.534
<b>to create a second image.</b>

06:07.601 --> 06:10.938
<b>If your details are on point,</b>
<b>your canvas will transform</b>

06:11.038 --> 06:14.174
<b>from one image to another when</b>
<b>viewed from different angles.</b>

06:14.241 --> 06:15.642
<b> <i>- This is insane.</i> </b>

06:15.709 --> 06:18.545
<b>We have to paint while</b>
<b>the other person is painting</b>

06:18.612 --> 06:21.448
<b>on a different side</b>
<b>but still the same well?</b>

06:21.515 --> 06:22.816
<b>This is gonna be hard.</b>

06:22.883 --> 06:24.751
<b>- If you win,</b>
<b>your shop will have the power</b>

06:24.818 --> 06:28.388
<b>to assign all the human canvases</b>
<b>in the elimination tattoo.</b>

06:28.455 --> 06:32.960
<b>You will have five hours</b>
<b>to create two images,</b>

06:33.060 --> 06:35.796
<b>and your time starts now.</b>

06:35.863 --> 06:38.699
<b> <i>[rock music]</i> </b>

06:38.765 --> 06:40.767
<b>- You better</b>
<b>walk a little faster.</b>

06:40.834 --> 06:41.768
<b>- All right.</b>

06:41.835 --> 06:43.670
<b>- Nine.</b>
<b>We got nine.</b>

06:43.737 --> 06:46.073
<b>- The hardest thing about</b>
<b>this challenge is getting</b>

06:46.139 --> 06:48.108
<b>your design laid out</b>
<b>onto the canvas.</b>

06:48.175 --> 06:49.343
<b>- We're gonna fold the paper.</b>

06:49.409 --> 06:50.878
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- And draw it that way.</b>

06:50.944 --> 06:53.247
<b> <i>- But you can't just draw</i> </b>
<b> <i>right across the canvas;</i> </b>

06:53.313 --> 06:55.082
<b>you have to draw panel by panel</b>

06:55.115 --> 06:57.351
<b>and look at it from far back</b>
<b>to make sure it lines up.</b>

06:57.417 --> 06:58.652
<b>- Probably right here.</b>

06:58.719 --> 07:01.221
<b>- It's a 90-degree</b>
<b>straight on with my side.</b>

07:01.288 --> 07:04.191
<b> <i>- Having your details line up</i> </b>
<b> <i>from one panel to the next</i> </b>

07:04.258 --> 07:05.392
<b>is gonna be very difficult.</b>

07:05.459 --> 07:07.027
<b>- The pharaoh Nefertiti.</b>

07:07.094 --> 07:09.696
<b>If we want,</b>
<b>we could do two on each side.</b>

07:09.763 --> 07:11.031
<b>- All right.</b>
<b>Let's do it.</b>

07:11.098 --> 07:14.902
<b>- Right here,</b>
<b>we have to set fear in these</b>

07:15.035 --> 07:16.370
<b>competitors' hearts.</b>

07:16.436 --> 07:17.771
<b>- Don't make it so flat.</b>

07:17.838 --> 07:19.339
<b>Do the same thing you were doing</b>
<b>and clean that up.</b>

07:19.406 --> 07:23.744
<b>We're good to go.</b>

07:23.810 --> 07:27.581
<b>- I'm thinking "War and Peace"--</b>
<b>two hands.</b>

07:27.648 --> 07:29.049
<b>- No, I don't want to do that.</b>

07:29.082 --> 07:30.184
<b>Let's just do a landscape.</b>

07:30.250 --> 07:31.752
<b>I think I'm pretty good at that.</b>

07:31.818 --> 07:33.620
<b>Like, I really feel</b>
<b>comfortable doing it.</b>

07:33.687 --> 07:35.889
<b>- Um...</b>

07:35.956 --> 07:37.424
<b>- He's taking the lead</b>
<b>on everything,</b>

07:37.491 --> 07:40.127
<b>and I feel like so far it hasn't</b>
<b>been working in our favor.</b>

07:40.194 --> 07:45.065
<b>- We did a landscape for</b>
<b>the last challenge, and we lost.</b>

07:45.132 --> 07:46.166
<b>- It was a cityscape.</b>

07:46.233 --> 07:47.668
<b>- Okay.</b>

07:47.734 --> 07:49.203
<b>So you still want</b>
<b>to do a landscape, or...</b>

07:49.269 --> 07:50.671
<b>- Mm-hmm.</b>

07:50.737 --> 07:52.306
<b>I'm doing what I want to do,</b>
<b>and I'm not budging.</b>

07:52.372 --> 07:56.310
<b>Well, I'm comfortable with doing</b>
<b>this, is what I'm telling you.</b>

07:56.376 --> 07:57.477
<b>- Thinking I was gonna do,</b>

07:57.544 --> 07:58.946
<b>like, a little black</b>
<b>around the edges</b>

07:59.079 --> 08:01.648
<b>so that it looks like</b>
<b>there's a lot of depth going on.</b>

08:01.715 --> 08:04.284
<b>I like to have a plan,</b>
<b>and Dane's like, "No!</b>

08:04.351 --> 08:05.886
<b>We have to do it now!"</b>

08:06.019 --> 08:07.855
<b>- It's easier just</b>
<b>to draw on paint, April.</b>

08:07.921 --> 08:11.692
<b>- You do things your way;</b>
<b>I'll do them my way, all right?</b>

08:11.758 --> 08:13.160
<b>- I'm gonna be done painting</b>

08:13.227 --> 08:15.462
<b>an hour before she even</b>
<b>starts touching paint.</b>

08:15.529 --> 08:16.830
<b>That's what's gonna happen.</b>

08:16.897 --> 08:18.699
<b>Oh, my God,</b>
<b>little grandma over here.</b>

08:18.765 --> 08:20.234
<b>- Are you being sarcastic?</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

08:20.300 --> 08:21.735
<b>- Are you being an asshole?</b>
<b>- I'm being an asshole.</b>

08:21.802 --> 08:23.437
<b>- Make sure you get all</b>
<b>these darks in these eyes.</b>

08:23.504 --> 08:24.805
<b>- I'm doing what I can, man.</b>

09:02.276 --> 09:06.747

09:11.518 --> 09:12.853
<b>I love you.</b>
<b>Hurry up.</b>

09:12.920 --> 09:15.189

<b>We may need to strategize</b>
<b>a bit better next time.</b>

09:29.036 --> 09:31.572

<b>Snake looks cool so far, though.</b>

09:31.638 --> 09:33.106

09:33.173 --> 09:34.908

<b>- Okay, artists, it is now</b>
<b>time to critique your work.</b>

10:19.720 --> 10:22.356
<b>Let's start with Old Town Ink.</b>
<b>What was your plan here?</b>

10:22.422 --> 10:24.024
<b>- We kind of wanted to</b>
<b>do something that was, like,</b>

10:24.091 --> 10:27.127
<b>a little mix of both of us,</b>
<b>and then you walk past it,</b>

10:27.194 --> 10:30.764
<b>and it flips to a skeleton,</b>
<b>kind of like an X-ray.</b>

10:30.831 --> 10:33.166
<b>- You guys definitely</b>
<b>showed details in the lashes,</b>

10:33.233 --> 10:35.702
<b>in the brows, the hair,</b>
<b>the scruff on the chin.</b>

10:35.769 --> 10:38.105
<b>- Bubba, you didn't</b>
<b>really get a lot of gradients</b>

10:38.172 --> 10:40.007
<b>between the white and</b>
<b>the gray and the black.</b>

10:40.073 --> 10:41.608
<b>It's pretty patchy,</b>
<b>a little bit sloppier,</b>

10:41.675 --> 10:45.212
<b>but it does translate the idea.</b>

10:45.279 --> 10:46.513
<b>- Pinz and Needlez...</b>

10:46.580 --> 10:47.915
<b>- I like the concept.</b>

10:47.981 --> 10:49.249
<b>The owl side uses up a lot</b>
<b>more of the canvas--</b>

10:49.316 --> 10:50.817
<b>the green</b>
<b>and the magenta together</b>

10:50.884 --> 10:52.486
<b>is a very cool color play.</b>

10:52.553 --> 10:53.921
<b>As far as in the eye side,</b>

10:53.987 --> 10:55.756
<b>it's also a lot of</b>
<b>smaller detail--the tree in</b>

10:55.822 --> 10:57.791
<b>the reflection of the eye</b>
<b>and everything is very cool.</b>

10:57.858 --> 11:00.594
<b>- Both of these have</b>
<b>the beginnings of great pieces.</b>

11:00.661 --> 11:03.063
<b>Both of them just</b>
<b>need the finishing touches.</b>

11:03.096 --> 11:04.097
<b>- Thank you.</b>
<b>- Thanks.</b>

11:04.164 --> 11:06.099
<b>- Allegory Arts, how'd this go?</b>

11:06.166 --> 11:08.235
<b>- Just completely</b>
<b>mismanaged time.</b>

11:08.302 --> 11:10.537
<b>- It's sad that it's unfinished,</b>
<b>'cause the face looks very nice.</b>

11:10.604 --> 11:12.306
<b>You did get a</b>
<b>lot of smooth blends.</b>

11:12.372 --> 11:14.942
<b>- I'll also say that,</b>
<b>anatomically, one of the better</b>

11:15.075 --> 11:17.744
<b>snakes that we've seen anybody</b>
<b>slap down in the competition.</b>

11:17.811 --> 11:19.246
<b>I do appreciate the detail.</b>

11:19.313 --> 11:20.514
<b>I think you guys</b>
<b>were onto something.</b>

11:20.581 --> 11:23.083
<b>I think you</b>
<b>needed a lot more time.</b>

11:23.150 --> 11:24.084
<b>- Black Anchor.</b>

11:24.151 --> 11:25.519
<b>- Massively unfinished.</b>

11:25.586 --> 11:28.155
<b>You were two of the guys</b>
<b>who the clock is heavy on.</b>

11:28.222 --> 11:29.523
<b>- We thought it was gonna</b>
<b>be a lot easier, and then once</b>

11:29.590 --> 11:32.226
<b>we got at these angles,</b>
<b>we were like, "Man,</b>

11:32.292 --> 11:33.360
<b>this [bleep]</b>
<b>does not line up."</b>

11:33.427 --> 11:34.595
<b>- You guys are talented.</b>

11:34.661 --> 11:36.129
<b>You guys have all</b>
<b>the tools that it takes,</b>

11:36.196 --> 11:38.699
<b>but you're not letting loose.</b>

11:38.765 --> 11:40.234
<b>- Tri-Cities Tattoos...</b>

11:40.300 --> 11:43.670
<b>- Bang, what you did here</b>
<b>excels far past everybody else.</b>

11:43.737 --> 11:46.340
<b>It took a lot of confidence</b>
<b>to be able to come in,</b>

11:46.406 --> 11:48.175
<b>map out this landscape,</b>
<b>and go for it.</b>

11:48.242 --> 11:50.911
<b>The loose, referenced details</b>
<b>that you create in this</b>

11:50.978 --> 11:52.613
<b>are where you really show off.</b>

11:52.679 --> 11:53.914
<b>- Unfortunately for y'all,</b>

11:53.981 --> 11:55.949
<b>both sides have to</b>
<b>be outstanding to win.</b>

11:56.016 --> 11:58.752
<b>Dave, your side looks a little</b>
<b>bit more like a coloring book,</b>

11:58.819 --> 12:00.787
<b>and hers looks a little bit</b>
<b>more like a real painting.</b>

12:00.854 --> 12:03.257
<b>- It might be time to let that</b>
<b>feminine energy run wild.</b>

12:03.323 --> 12:04.658
<b>Let her lead;</b>
<b>see where it goes.</b>

12:04.725 --> 12:06.059
<b>It's going good.</b>

12:06.059 --> 12:07.628
<b>- That's what I wanted</b>
<b>to hear--the fact that I</b>

12:07.694 --> 12:09.196
<b>carry my team--because I did.</b>

12:09.263 --> 12:13.433
<b>Dave, maybe you should let</b>
<b>me take the wheel from now on.</b>

12:13.500 --> 12:14.935
<b>- Artistic Skin Designs.</b>

12:15.068 --> 12:16.203
<b>- It's really loose.</b>

12:16.270 --> 12:18.438
<b>As far as the detail challenge</b>
<b>goes,</b>

12:18.505 --> 12:21.842
<b>the cat definitely</b>
<b>shows a little bit more detail.</b>

12:21.909 --> 12:23.310
<b>My biggest problem</b>
<b>is with the fish.</b>

12:23.377 --> 12:24.678
<b>It doesn't line up.</b>

12:24.745 --> 12:27.080
<b>The outlines go from</b>
<b>the eye from one panel to</b>

12:27.080 --> 12:29.883
<b>the next panel.</b>
<b>You missed a mark on it.</b>

12:29.950 --> 12:31.485
<b>- Classic Trilogy Tattoo.</b>

12:31.552 --> 12:33.587
<b>- My side over here would</b>
<b>be Jekyll,</b>

12:33.654 --> 12:34.655
<b>and as you flip</b>
<b>to the other side,</b>

12:34.721 --> 12:36.089
<b>you can see Hyde.</b>

12:36.123 --> 12:37.991
<b>- I would say</b>
<b>that the Dr. Jekyll side</b>

12:38.091 --> 12:42.329
<b>lines up a lot better</b>
<b>than the Mr. Hyde side.</b>

12:42.396 --> 12:45.365
<b>- In a detail challenge,</b>
<b>it just misses the mark.</b>

12:45.432 --> 12:47.000
<b>- Unkindness.</b>

12:47.100 --> 12:50.304
<b>- The fox has the nicest detail</b>
<b>of anything in the room today...</b>

12:50.370 --> 12:53.440
<b>- And I really love that you</b>
<b>guys were able to put the really</b>

12:53.507 --> 12:55.275
<b>nice little details</b>
<b>of the teeth, the nice</b>

12:55.342 --> 12:57.511
<b>little details in the mouth.</b>
<b>It sets it off.</b>

12:57.578 --> 12:59.713
<b>As far as the girl goes,</b>
<b>she's beautiful.</b>

12:59.780 --> 13:01.582
<b>The detail from the</b>
<b>back of the face,</b>

13:01.648 --> 13:02.916
<b>from the hair coming forward--</b>

13:03.050 --> 13:05.485
<b>you did a really great job</b>
<b>on this one.</b>

13:05.552 --> 13:07.054
<b>- Think Before You Ink.</b>

13:07.054 --> 13:08.722
<b>- The profile of</b>
<b>Nefertiti is beautiful.</b>

13:08.789 --> 13:10.557
<b>I like the subtle little</b>
<b>highlight that you have in the</b>

13:10.624 --> 13:12.926
<b>top of her eye</b>
<b>with her looking off into space.</b>

13:13.060 --> 13:14.795
<b>She has pretty lips,</b>
<b>a pretty nose.</b>

13:14.862 --> 13:16.930
<b>The darker skin tone</b>
<b>that you used in the front,</b>

13:17.064 --> 13:19.166
<b>juxtaposed with the lighter</b>
<b>skin tone in the back,</b>

13:19.233 --> 13:20.767
<b>versus the galactic background</b>

13:20.834 --> 13:23.070
<b>all plays dynamically</b>
<b>to separate the two.</b>

13:23.103 --> 13:24.404
<b>Good choices.</b>

13:24.471 --> 13:27.441
<b>- We killed this challenge, man.</b>
<b>Comeback kings.</b>

13:27.508 --> 13:30.544

<b>in the these pieces right here.</b>

13:30.611 --> 13:32.312

<b>- Me and this mother[bleep]</b>
<b>are gonna win.</b>

13:40.187 --> 13:41.955
<b>- That tattoo</b>
<b>just seems impossible.</b>

13:42.089 --> 13:44.191
<b>- How do you even do that?</b>
<b>- Oh, my God, no.</b>

13:44.258 --> 13:45.659

<b>Think Before You Ink--Made</b>
<b>Rich and DTat came back.</b>

<b>some detail and</b>
<b>finished both full canvasses.</b>

<b>She just painted the hell</b>
<b>out of that thing.</b>

<b>- Did Danger Dave drop</b>
<b>the ball for Tri-Cities?</b>

14:18.090 --> 14:19.591
<b>- She ran circles around him.</b>

14:19.658 --> 14:21.994
<b>Today was her day, and she</b>
<b>got to show off, and she did.</b>

14:22.061 --> 14:23.595
<b>- Let's talk</b>
<b>about Unkindness Art.</b>

14:23.662 --> 14:25.297
<b>- Their images</b>
<b>lined up perfectly.</b>

14:25.364 --> 14:27.366
<b>Their overall plan</b>
<b>was flawless.</b>

<b>Yeah. But it's all right.</b>

<b>We'll do what we got</b>
<b>to do with the tattoos.</b>

<b>It didn't work.</b>

<b>- As far as strategizing,</b>
<b>this is a giant chess game.</b>

15:46.578 --> 15:48.047
<b>It's slow and steady, man.</b>

15:48.113 --> 15:50.282
<b>- But you've been in this house,</b>
<b>and you know how a [bleep]</b>

15:50.349 --> 15:53.252
<b>bites you in the ass</b>
<b>if you don't do what you can do</b>

15:53.318 --> 15:55.721
<b>from the jump to</b>
<b>manipulate it to your favor.</b>

15:55.788 --> 15:57.723
<b>- Yeah, but my tattoos are</b>
<b>speaking for that, though, dude.</b>

15:57.790 --> 15:58.724
<b>- Why play this fair game?</b>

15:58.791 --> 16:00.225
<b>- I'm an artist, man, like,</b>

16:00.259 --> 16:01.894
<b>since I've been born,</b>
<b>I've been a [bleep] artist.</b>

16:01.960 --> 16:03.529
<b>- But you never</b>
<b>been in this house.</b>

16:03.595 --> 16:04.763
<b>- If you know how to tattoo--</b>

16:04.830 --> 16:05.798
<b>- You've never</b>
<b>been in this competition.</b>

16:05.864 --> 16:07.032
<b>You don't know in this game.</b>

16:07.099 --> 16:08.334
<b>- I do know.</b>
<b>- You should know, bro.</b>

16:08.400 --> 16:09.668
<b>- And that's why I brought DJ.</b>

16:09.735 --> 16:10.936

16:28.387 --> 16:31.323
<b>Based on your work,</b>
<b>one shop will lose their shot</b>

16:31.390 --> 16:35.928
<b>at $200,000 and the</b>
<b>first-ever title of Master Shop.</b>

16:35.994 --> 16:38.030
<b>Made Rich,</b>

16:38.097 --> 16:39.365
<b>it's on your shop</b>

16:39.431 --> 16:41.533
<b>you deserve to be back</b>
<b>in this competition</b>

16:41.600 --> 16:44.269
<b>by proving that</b>
<b>you've overcome your weaknesses.</b>

16:44.336 --> 16:49.308
<b>And in Made Rich's honor,</b>
<b>you'll all be judged on detail.</b>

16:49.375 --> 16:53.812
<b>Today, you must tattoo</b>
<b>a natural disaster.</b>

16:53.879 --> 16:54.913
<b>- What?</b>
<b>- What?</b>

16:54.980 --> 16:56.081
<b>- Oh, my God.</b>

16:56.215 --> 16:57.750
<b>- Whether it's a</b>
<b>volcanic eruption,</b>

16:57.816 --> 16:59.952
<b>a meteor shower, or a tornado,</b>

17:00.019 --> 17:02.855
<b>it's the fine details that</b>
<b>will bring your scene to life.</b>

17:02.921 --> 17:04.589
<b>- [bleep].</b>

17:04.656 --> 17:06.759
<b>- Showing detail</b>
<b>in a natural disaster tattoo</b>

17:06.825 --> 17:08.660
<b>is gonna be really hard.</b>

17:08.727 --> 17:11.530
<b>It's movement and chaos</b>
<b>and screaming.</b>

17:11.597 --> 17:14.299
<b>It's not something that</b>
<b>you can illustrate easily.</b>

17:14.366 --> 17:16.300
<b>- The strength of your shop</b>
<b>as a team</b>

17:16.367 --> 17:19.972
<b>will determine your success</b>
<b>or failure in this competition.</b>

17:20.039 --> 17:21.040

<b>- And for this tattoo,</b>

17:22.273 --> 17:24.676
<b>once again,</b>
<b>you will be tag-teaming.</b>

17:24.742 --> 17:28.681
<b>Your shop will create one tattoo</b>
<b>on the same canvas.</b>

17:28.747 --> 17:30.516
<b>Only one of you can tattoo</b>
<b>at a time,</b>

17:30.582 --> 17:33.252
<b>and you must switch artists</b>
<b>every hour.</b>

17:33.252 --> 17:35.521
<b>Remember,</b>
<b>after every elimination tattoo,</b>

17:35.587 --> 17:38.624
<b>all of you</b>
<b>will form the jury of peers.</b>

17:38.691 --> 17:42.261
<b>You'll deliberate and choose one</b>
<b>shop to put up for elimination.</b>

17:42.261 --> 17:43.796
<b>Let's meet your canvases.</b>

17:43.862 --> 17:48.534
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

17:48.600 --> 17:51.303
<b>- Unkindness Art, your shop</b>
<b>won the flash challenge.</b>

17:51.370 --> 17:54.873
<b>That means that you now have the</b>
<b>power to assign the canvases.</b>

17:54.940 --> 17:58.210
<b>The advantages are hard</b>
<b>to come by, so use it wisely.</b>

17:58.210 --> 17:59.845
<b>- The vets need to go home.</b>

17:59.912 --> 18:01.347
<b>So what were you</b>
<b>wanting to get done?</b>

18:01.413 --> 18:03.248
<b>- A tornado destroying</b>
<b>a cemetery on the left bicep.</b>

18:03.315 --> 18:04.983
<b>- New people can't just come in,</b>

18:05.050 --> 18:07.553
<b>middle of the game,</b>
<b>and try to dominate.</b>

18:07.619 --> 18:08.854
<b>We're gonna give</b>
<b>them the hard one.</b>

18:08.921 --> 18:11.623
<b>- I want a tsunami</b>
<b>swallowing a pirate ship.</b>

18:13.325 --> 18:16.595
<b>- A hurricane crashing</b>
<b>into shore on my left forearm.</b>

18:18.230 --> 18:20.566
<b>Hurricanes are literal wind.</b>
<b>They don't look like anything.</b>

18:20.632 --> 18:23.135
<b>That tattoo just seems,</b>
<b>like, almost impossible.</b>

18:23.235 --> 18:25.037
<b>- I want an erupting volcano</b>
<b>on my ribs.</b>

18:25.104 --> 18:26.438
<b>- Oh, [bleep]. Cool.</b>
<b>- All right.</b>

18:27.973 --> 18:29.541
<b>- An earthquake</b>
<b>engulfing a city.</b>

18:29.608 --> 18:31.343
<b>- Yes.</b>
<b>- No.</b>

18:31.410 --> 18:32.611
<b>- Oh, my God, no.</b>

18:32.678 --> 18:34.046
<b>I don't want to do</b>
<b>any of these things.</b>

18:34.113 --> 18:35.280
<b>These are terrible.</b>

18:38.717 --> 18:40.619
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>- Doom is a chess player...</b>

18:40.686 --> 18:41.820
<b>- Here you go, dude.</b>

18:41.887 --> 18:43.322
<b>- And he's a</b>
<b>really good chess player.</b>

18:43.389 --> 18:45.090
<b>- Who was getting the hurricane?</b>
<b>Here you go, man.</b>

18:45.157 --> 18:48.460
<b>- So I'm leaving this pretty</b>
<b>much solely in Doom's hands.</b>

18:48.527 --> 18:51.130
<b>- There you go, man.</b>
<b>- There you go.</b>

18:51.263 --> 18:52.464
<b>- Okay, canvases.</b>

18:52.531 --> 18:54.700
<b>One by one,</b>
<b>please read the artist's name</b>

18:56.568 --> 18:58.570
<b>- Tri-Cities Tattoo.</b>

18:58.637 --> 19:00.539

19:01.840 --> 19:04.543
<b>- A volcano.</b>
<b>- Black Anchor.</b>

19:04.610 --> 19:06.779
<b>- They gave us</b>
<b>the biggest piece.</b>

19:06.845 --> 19:08.681
<b>It's like, "What the [bleep]?"</b>

19:08.747 --> 19:13.952
<b>- What's up, Erin and Doom?</b>
<b>I thought you guys had our back.</b>

19:14.019 --> 19:16.488
<b>- Artistic Skin Design.</b>
<b>- Cool.</b>

19:16.555 --> 19:17.623
<b>- Allegory Arts.</b>

19:20.559 --> 19:21.894
<b>- Yeah.</b>

19:23.862 --> 19:25.864
<b>- Think Before You Ink.</b>

19:25.931 --> 19:28.133
<b>- I'm pissed,</b>
<b>but I figured everybody would</b>

19:28.233 --> 19:29.268
<b>be coming after me.</b>

19:32.237 --> 19:35.007
<b>- Classic Trilogy Tattoo.</b>

19:40.846 --> 19:43.449
<b>to tattoo</b>
<b>a detailed natural disaster,</b>

19:43.515 --> 19:47.519
<b>and if your work is a disaster,</b>
<b>your shop will be out.</b>

19:47.586 --> 19:49.355
<b>Good luck.</b>

19:49.421 --> 19:51.457
<b>- Today, we're testing</b>
<b>these artists on detail...</b>

19:51.523 --> 19:52.758
<b>- Thom.</b>
<b>- What's going on?</b>

19:52.825 --> 19:54.326
<b>- I'm Jessy.</b>
<b>Nice to meet you.</b>

19:54.393 --> 19:56.395
<b>- Whether it be a tidal wave,</b>
<b>an earthquake, explosions,</b>

19:56.462 --> 19:57.730
<b>you have to show movement.</b>

19:57.796 --> 19:59.064
<b>- What you looking to get done?</b>

19:59.198 --> 20:00.632
<b>- A hurricane</b>
<b>crashing against the shore.</b>

20:00.699 --> 20:03.769
<b>- Could be dust, fire,</b>
<b>wind, water, some type of force</b>

20:03.836 --> 20:04.903
<b>that's gonna demolish something.</b>

20:04.970 --> 20:05.938
<b>- A forest fire?</b>

20:06.005 --> 20:07.239
<b>- Yes.</b>

20:07.306 --> 20:08.240
<b>- If you're a tattooer that</b>
<b>doesn't have</b>

20:08.307 --> 20:09.875
<b>a versatile bag of tricks,</b>

20:09.942 --> 20:12.378
<b>it's gonna be very difficult to</b>
<b>pull off a natural disaster.</b>

20:12.444 --> 20:13.879
<b>- Volcano, huh?</b>

20:13.946 --> 20:15.848
<b>Because you could get--</b>
<b>- Are you open to moving it,</b>

20:15.914 --> 20:17.850
<b>or are you pretty set on--</b>
<b>- No, I'm with the ribs.</b>

20:17.916 --> 20:19.651
<b>- Can you just take</b>
<b>off your shirt for us?</b>

20:19.718 --> 20:22.855
<b>- I'm nervous about him sitting</b>
<b>for six hours on his ribs.</b>

20:22.921 --> 20:24.490
<b>He wants it big,</b>
<b>he wants it bold.</b>

20:24.556 --> 20:27.259
<b>It's a lot of saturation.</b>
<b>- [bleep].</b>

20:27.326 --> 20:31.897
<b>- Right back like I never left.</b>
<b>So we're talking hurricane.</b>

20:31.964 --> 20:33.599
<b>- Beach, shore, like, boardwalk.</b>

20:33.666 --> 20:35.801
<b>Palm trees blowing in the winds.</b>

20:35.868 --> 20:39.972
<b>Boarded-up buildings.</b>
<b>Definitely want hurricane flags.</b>

20:40.039 --> 20:41.273
<b>- Hurricane flags?</b>
<b>What's that?</b>

20:41.340 --> 20:44.109
<b>Off the bat,</b>
<b>this guy has too many images</b>

20:44.243 --> 20:48.013
<b>that he wants condensed in this</b>
<b>little landscape around his arm.</b>

20:48.080 --> 20:49.515
<b>- Where's the lowest we can go?</b>

20:49.581 --> 20:51.283
<b>- Lowest would be,</b>
<b>like, right there.</b>

20:51.350 --> 20:52.651
<b>- This is a detail challenge.</b>

20:52.718 --> 20:53.852
<b>Trying to cram too much in</b>
<b>might kill us.</b>

20:58.201 --> 21:02.405
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

21:02.472 --> 21:04.874
<b>- I still think this</b>
<b>needs to be a little smaller.</b>

21:04.941 --> 21:07.410
<b>- Why?</b>
<b>It'll look horrible small.</b>

21:07.477 --> 21:10.080
<b>- This is too big.</b>
<b>- That's not true at all.</b>

21:10.146 --> 21:14.384
<b>- Just a little reduced in size.</b>
<b>Don't you think?</b>

21:14.451 --> 21:16.786
<b>- No. I don't.</b>

21:16.853 --> 21:18.822
<b>- Look how much better that is.</b>
<b>You don't think so?</b>

21:18.888 --> 21:23.093
<b>- Nope. It's fine. Let's do it.</b>

21:23.159 --> 21:25.562
<b>- Well, if you don't think so,</b>
<b>we don't have to do it.</b>

21:25.629 --> 21:28.365
<b>- No, it's okay.</b>
<b>Let's just use the smaller one.</b>

21:28.431 --> 21:29.733
<b>- You don't want</b>
<b>to do the bigger one?</b>

21:29.799 --> 21:31.301
<b>- No.</b>

21:31.368 --> 21:33.436
<b>- If you really think it'll</b>
<b>be better, then let's do it.</b>

21:33.503 --> 21:34.504
<b>- No. It's fine.</b>
<b>Let's do it like this.</b>

21:34.571 --> 21:35.505
<b>- Don't be stubborn.</b>

21:35.572 --> 21:36.673
<b>- I'm not.</b>
<b>You're--</b>

21:36.740 --> 21:38.575
<b>- You are.</b>
<b>You're throwing a fit.</b>

21:38.642 --> 21:40.176
<b>- I'm not.</b>
<b>- You are.</b>

21:40.243 --> 21:41.745
<b>- God damn.</b>

21:41.811 --> 21:46.683
<b>- I feel like if you can't</b>
<b>communicate or take criticism,</b>

21:46.750 --> 21:48.852
<b>we're gonna keep,</b>
<b>like, butting heads.</b>

21:48.918 --> 21:50.220
<b>- Let's just do small.</b>

21:50.287 --> 21:51.755
<b>- Are you sure you</b>
<b>feel good about that?</b>

21:51.821 --> 21:53.323
<b>- Yeah. It's fine.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

21:53.390 --> 21:56.526
<b>- It sure is gonna be tiny.</b>

21:56.593 --> 21:58.662
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

21:58.728 --> 22:01.298
<b>- Artists, you have six hours to</b>
<b>tattoo</b>

22:01.364 --> 22:07.170
<b>a natural disaster,</b>
<b>and your time starts now.</b>

22:07.237 --> 22:09.739
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

22:09.806 --> 22:11.241
<b>- Let's go get this done.</b>

22:11.308 --> 22:13.677
<b>- Tattooing a natural disaster</b>
<b>could be very tricky.</b>

22:13.743 --> 22:16.913
<b>If it's a volcano or a tornado,</b>
<b>it needs to tell that story.</b>

22:16.980 --> 22:19.883
<b>It can't just be water</b>
<b>and then you say it's a tsunami.</b>

22:19.950 --> 22:22.886
<b>- Let me get these little</b>
<b>finishing touches in there.</b>

22:22.953 --> 22:24.187
<b>- Without the details,</b>

22:24.220 --> 22:25.588
<b>these images</b>
<b>aren't gonna come to life.</b>

22:25.655 --> 22:27.190
<b>- Nice.</b>

22:27.223 --> 22:29.225
<b>- I don't think we can call</b>
<b>anybody a frontrunner right now,</b>

22:29.292 --> 22:30.794
<b>but the people who start showing</b>

22:30.860 --> 22:32.862
<b>that they're working</b>
<b>well together the best</b>

22:32.929 --> 22:35.065
<b>are probably gonna have</b>
<b>an edge against the others.</b>

22:35.198 --> 22:36.333

22:36.399 --> 22:39.336

<b>- I decided to just go for it.</b>

22:46.042 --> 22:48.878
<b>I'm giving my canvas</b>
<b>everything he's asking for.</b>

<b>- Here's a--reference.</b>
<b>- Thank you.</b>

<b>We got some rocks.</b>
<b>We got some boardwalks.</b>

22:54.417 --> 22:55.685
<b>We got some palm trees.</b>

<b>There's no tattoo</b>

22:58.388 --> 23:00.457
<b>- Time to get busy.</b>

23:00.523 --> 23:03.827
<b>I believe Made Rich knows what</b>
<b>the judges want more than me.</b>

23:03.893 --> 23:05.862
<b>- Make sure to leave a</b>
<b>little skin break off the car.</b>

23:05.929 --> 23:08.331
<b>- Got it.</b>
<b>both: And the flag pole.</b>

23:08.398 --> 23:10.166

<b>Let's go.</b>

<b>Your guys' line work is pretty</b>

<b>- Today, we need to step it up</b>
<b>and take it to the next level.</b>

23:26.383 --> 23:27.651
<b>- I love that I don't even have</b>
<b>to, like,</b>

<b>tell you stuff</b>
<b>that I have plans of doing.</b>

23:29.719 --> 23:30.887

<b>Put your machine</b>

23:59.983 --> 24:01.251
<b>I just took the lead</b>
<b>on the flash challenge,</b>

24:01.318 --> 24:02.752

<b>Dave, are you gonna keep</b>

24:06.523 --> 24:08.425

<b>from attending art school</b>

24:11.161 --> 24:12.796
<b>and majoring in illustration.</b>

24:12.862 --> 24:17.400
<b>In my sophomore year, I started</b>
<b>doing ROTC to pay for school.</b>

<b>We got 21 minutes left.</b>

<b>I take on that role to</b>

24:42.592 --> 24:44.060

<b>really great realism artists.</b>

24:50.533 --> 24:52.969

<b>an alliance in this competition.</b>

24:59.876 --> 25:03.146
<b>I think they gave us</b>
<b>the harder one maybe to try</b>

25:03.146 --> 25:04.547
<b>and knock us down a little bit.</b>

25:04.614 --> 25:06.916
<b>I'm biting my lip off right now.</b>

25:06.983 --> 25:09.552

<b>- That's too big, dude.</b>

26:44.848 --> 26:48.218
<b>all the color</b>

<b>I don't know where anything is,</b>

26:57.694 --> 27:00.196

27:33.330 --> 27:34.431
<b>- Mm-hmm.</b>
<b>I agree.</b>

27:34.498 --> 27:36.433
<b>- It's a confused image.</b>
<b>It's jam-packed.</b>

<b>- I feel like it</b>
<b>was just too busy.</b>

27:37.968 --> 27:39.903
<b>- But the purpose of</b>
<b>the challenge is to do detail.</b>

27:39.970 --> 27:41.204
<b>- It didn't work,</b>
<b>and it was poorly done.</b>

27:41.271 --> 27:43.073
<b>- We had detail.</b>
<b>That's the challenge.</b>

27:43.140 --> 27:44.341
<b>- I mean, that's fine.</b>
<b>Like I said--</b>

<b>You: clean tattoo, no detail.</b>

<b>we're just saying that</b>
<b>you did it the wrong way.</b>

27:53.650 --> 27:54.718
<b>- It's a detail challenge.</b>

<b>- I know, but you did too much.</b>

<b>Detail.</b>
<b>The challenge is detail.</b>

<b>- If you're not gonna</b>
<b>hit the challenge,</b>

<b>what's the point</b>
<b>of doing the tattoo?</b>

<b>was to drop the ball,</b>

<b>Made Rich,</b>
<b>this challenge was designed to</b>

<b>Think Before You Ink,</b>

28:32.189 --> 28:34.691
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

<b>is a strong design</b>

<b>that doesn't really</b>
<b>translate into tattoo</b>

28:38.261 --> 28:39.763
<b>as well as it did on paper.</b>

<b>You do have smooth shading.</b>

<b>The actual imagery--lost.</b>

<b>in the water</b>
<b>that you do in the car.</b>

<b>- Overall, I just like</b>
<b>how soft this thing is.</b>

<b>Lots of really nice details in</b>
<b>the foreground,</b>

29:07.224 --> 29:08.492
<b>certainly with the tree,</b>

<b>with the grass,</b>

29:11.495 --> 29:12.796
<b>Certainly identifiable.</b>

29:12.863 --> 29:14.331
<b>- You have a lot of nice light</b>

<b>that comes in from the right</b>
<b>side where the clouds are,</b>

29:16.199 --> 29:17.734
<b>and then you capture the</b>
<b>darkness</b>

29:17.734 --> 29:19.803
<b>on the left side with</b>
<b>the looming cloud over the top.</b>

29:19.870 --> 29:21.271

<b>definitely tell what's going on.</b>

29:30.447 --> 29:31.715
<b>I definitely see a tornado,</b>

29:31.781 --> 29:33.416

<b>this little gate</b>

<b>This thing looks like</b>

29:39.523 --> 29:41.024
<b>two pieces, and it opens,</b>

<b>but somehow,</b>
<b>when it flew in the air,</b>

29:42.559 --> 29:44.694
<b>both pieces just stayed</b>
<b>perfectly together and are</b>

29:44.761 --> 29:47.164
<b>flying instead of it</b>
<b>opening and getting torn apart.</b>

29:47.230 --> 29:49.299
<b>It seems a little weird to me.</b>

<b>The details you have on</b>
<b>the bottom of the tombstones--</b>

<b>questionable line work.</b>

<b>your neighborhood is,</b>
<b>like, right up our alley.</b>

30:09.352 --> 30:12.489
<b>- I just feel like the center</b>
<b>of the meteor is a cover-up.</b>

30:12.556 --> 30:14.591
<b>It's the only place where you</b>
<b>just have this patch of black.</b>

30:14.724 --> 30:15.926
<b>- Yeah.</b>

<b>the hubcap, the street.</b>

<b>You're gonna have to step out of</b>
<b>that</b>

<b>and show us some versatility.</b>

30:27.838 --> 30:30.440
<b>â™ª â™ª</b>

<b>- You have a lot of</b>
<b>anatomy problems with the ship.</b>

30:33.376 --> 30:35.679
<b>The lowest front sail</b>
<b>just disappears into the boat.</b>

<b>It's hard to read.</b>

<b>the mechanics of the ship,</b>

<b>you have to understand</b>

<b>of the water</b>
<b>pushing the ship.</b>

<b>Our bottom water,</b>
<b>the finger waves are one size.</b>

30:44.387 --> 30:45.789
<b>The middle piece</b>
<b>that's coming up</b>

<b>over the sail,</b>
<b>another size of fingers.</b>

30:47.958 --> 30:50.527
<b>Then we go to just this plastic</b>
<b>green piece up there.</b>

30:50.594 --> 30:52.929
<b>Making water look like water--</b>
<b>those are all tricks,</b>

<b>and you have to have</b>
<b>all those tricks</b>

<b>here on the technical side</b>

31:05.041 --> 31:06.810
<b>is the green in the roof area.</b>

31:06.877 --> 31:08.245
<b>It just sticks out</b>
<b>like a sore thumb.</b>

31:08.311 --> 31:10.213
<b>Those wobbles are very evident.</b>

31:10.280 --> 31:12.382
<b>- You have details</b>
<b>throughout this design,</b>

31:12.449 --> 31:15.852
<b>but the idea of the tsunami</b>
<b>wave, like, covering a mountain,</b>

31:15.919 --> 31:18.188
<b>I envision a bigger wave,</b>

31:18.255 --> 31:20.223
<b>and then a mountain</b>
<b>that's about to be engulfed.</b>

31:20.290 --> 31:22.459
<b>This looks like the wave</b>
<b>is the foreground,</b>

31:22.526 --> 31:24.027
<b>and the mountain</b>
<b>is the background.</b>

31:24.094 --> 31:27.731
<b>There's just too much that</b>
<b>just doesn't seem to make sense.</b>

31:27.798 --> 31:28.765
<b>- Black Anchor.</b>

31:28.832 --> 31:31.802
<b>â™ª â™ª</b>

31:31.868 --> 31:35.205
<b>- The perimeter shape is</b>
<b>just an obtrusive, big smear</b>

31:35.272 --> 31:38.074
<b>on the side of his body.</b>
<b>You got to leave some open skin.</b>

31:38.141 --> 31:40.911
<b>It's like everywhere you look</b>
<b>in this tattoo is a cover-up.</b>

31:40.977 --> 31:42.979
<b>The only contrast you have</b>
<b>is from the areas of</b>

31:43.046 --> 31:45.682
<b>solid color to the areas</b>
<b>of light color you did.</b>

31:45.682 --> 31:48.051
<b>- As far as details go,</b>
<b>there's no detail.</b>

31:48.118 --> 31:52.022
<b>This is one of the rougher</b>
<b>tattoos I've seen.</b>

31:52.088 --> 31:53.190
<b>- Artistic Skin Design.</b>

31:53.256 --> 31:56.026
<b>â™ª â™ª</b>

31:56.092 --> 31:57.694
<b>- There are some</b>
<b>great details in here.</b>

31:57.761 --> 32:00.764
<b>Each little line of the little</b>
<b>pine needles is very crisp,</b>

32:00.831 --> 32:02.933
<b>very sharp,</b>
<b>very technically solid.</b>

32:02.999 --> 32:04.067
<b>- The way you shaded the</b>
<b>tattoo</b>

32:04.134 --> 32:05.502
<b>just to capture</b>
<b>the light sources</b>

32:05.569 --> 32:07.571
<b>on both sides of those</b>
<b>thin little trees</b>

32:07.704 --> 32:09.539
<b>adds the life into the piece</b>
<b>that it needs</b>

32:09.606 --> 32:11.308
<b>even in that dead forest.</b>

32:11.374 --> 32:13.076
<b>But the fire is rigid.</b>

32:13.143 --> 32:15.579
<b>- Tattooing fire is</b>
<b>not incredibly difficult,</b>

32:15.712 --> 32:18.081
<b>but tattooing,</b>
<b>like, a forest on fire</b>

32:18.148 --> 32:19.716
<b>was definitely a challenge.</b>

32:19.749 --> 32:22.486
<b>- Making things that are still</b>
<b>look like they're in motion</b>

32:22.552 --> 32:26.022
<b>is the trick</b>
<b>for all of us as tattooers.</b>

32:26.089 --> 32:27.057
<b>- Old Town Ink.</b>

32:27.124 --> 32:29.493
<b>â™ª â™ª</b>

32:29.559 --> 32:32.662
<b>- This is a definite swing</b>
<b>for the fences, but I like it.</b>

32:32.662 --> 32:34.231
<b>The details in this thing--</b>

32:34.297 --> 32:37.367
<b>the little truck, the little guy</b>
<b>hanging off the truck, the car,</b>

32:37.434 --> 32:40.670
<b>and the nicest light post</b>
<b>I've ever seen tattooed,</b>

32:40.670 --> 32:43.140
<b>but that crack where this</b>
<b>is all going into</b>

32:43.206 --> 32:45.442
<b>is where you</b>
<b>needed to spend the time</b>

32:45.509 --> 32:47.310
<b>to punch home what this was.</b>

32:47.377 --> 32:48.879
<b>- There's so many areas that</b>

32:48.945 --> 32:50.947
<b>don't have any</b>
<b>shading at all in them.</b>

32:51.014 --> 32:53.316
<b>That big, blank,</b>
<b>white face of the building there</b>

32:53.383 --> 32:58.455
<b>with all the windows</b>
<b>in it--it looks unfinished.</b>

32:58.522 --> 33:01.892
<b>- Okay, judges, time to announce</b>
<b>the best tattoo of the day.</b>

33:01.958 --> 33:03.960
<b>- The ones that stand out</b>
<b>as hitting the challenge</b>

33:04.027 --> 33:05.695
<b>and having detail and looking</b>
<b>like what they were supposed</b>

33:05.695 --> 33:08.732
<b>to be--obviously, Pinz</b>
<b>and Needlez and Artistic Skin.</b>

33:08.799 --> 33:09.866
<b>- What about Old Town?</b>

33:09.933 --> 33:11.935
<b>- It's just way too unfinished.</b>

33:12.002 --> 33:13.603
<b>- Yeah, I mean,</b>
<b>I love the tattoo,</b>

33:13.703 --> 33:15.839
<b>but I want to see</b>
<b>more of it done.</b>

33:15.906 --> 33:17.707
<b>- So we have</b>
<b>Artistic Skin Design,</b>

33:17.707 --> 33:19.242
<b>and we have Pinz and Needlez.</b>

33:19.309 --> 33:20.477
<b>- I think</b>
<b>the Pinz and Needlez one</b>

33:20.544 --> 33:22.546
<b>looks like a finished,</b>
<b>beautiful piece.</b>

33:22.612 --> 33:24.447
<b>- I think Pinz and Needlez</b>
<b>take this one.</b>

33:24.514 --> 33:25.682
<b>- I have to concur.</b>

33:25.749 --> 33:27.117
<b>The judges have decided that</b>

33:27.184 --> 33:31.555
<b>the best tattoo of the day</b>
<b>goes to Pinz and Needlez.</b>

33:31.655 --> 33:33.890
<b>All right, artists.</b>
<b>As the jury of peers,</b>

33:33.957 --> 33:37.360
<b>you must deliberate and</b>
<b>put one shop up for elimination.</b>

33:37.427 --> 33:38.462
<b>Head back to the loft.</b>

33:38.528 --> 33:42.566
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

33:42.666 --> 33:43.934
<b>- I'm just gonna</b>
<b>go out and say it.</b>

33:44.000 --> 33:45.202
<b>I feel like</b>
<b>I'm a better tattooer</b>

33:45.268 --> 33:46.670
<b>than all you guys</b>
<b>put together.</b>

33:46.736 --> 33:48.004
<b>- Oh.</b>

33:48.071 --> 33:50.140
<b>- Y'all stand a good chance</b>
<b>of going home.</b>

33:50.207 --> 33:52.008
<b>- I don't really think</b>
<b>we deserve to go home on it.</b>

33:52.075 --> 33:53.443
<b>- What the [bleep]?</b>
<b>What?</b>

33:53.510 --> 33:54.845
<b>- How are you gonna</b>
<b>walk around with your head</b>

33:54.911 --> 33:56.847
<b>hanging high knowing</b>
<b>that you did a bull[bleep]</b>

33:56.913 --> 33:58.882
<b>tattoo today,</b>
<b>and you still here?</b>

33:58.949 --> 33:59.883
<b>- Well, I mean--</b>
<b>- No, no, no, no, no.</b>

33:59.950 --> 34:01.685
<b>- If they're going off of--</b>

34:01.685 --> 34:03.887
<b>- I don't give a [bleep].</b>
<b>We did a solid tattoo.</b>

34:03.954 --> 34:05.188
<b>- Y'all got ripped</b>
<b>the most, man.</b>

34:05.255 --> 34:06.223
<b>- Yeah,</b>
<b>but at least ours was readable.</b>

34:06.289 --> 34:07.691
<b>- Ours is too.</b>

34:07.757 --> 34:09.559
<b>- Maybe after, like,</b>
<b>ten minutes of looking at it.</b>

34:09.693 --> 34:10.893
<b>- It hit the challenge.</b>

34:10.960 --> 34:12.262
<b>- But is it done well?</b>
<b>That's questionable.</b>

34:12.329 --> 34:13.697
<b>- Oh.</b>
<b>[scoffs]</b>

34:13.697 --> 34:14.831
<b>- You guys should have</b>
<b>thought before you inked.</b>

34:14.898 --> 34:15.398
<b>â™ª â™ª</b>

34:18.964 --> 34:24.202
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

34:24.268 --> 34:26.438
<b>- We're here as a jury of peers</b>
<b>to determine which shop</b>

34:26.505 --> 34:28.440
<b>should be brought down</b>
<b>for elimination.</b>

34:28.507 --> 34:29.875
<b>- What do you guys</b>
<b>think's the worst?</b>

34:29.940 --> 34:31.775
<b>- The worst? Black Anchor.</b>
<b>Looks like a cover-up.</b>

34:31.842 --> 34:32.944
<b>- It does look like a cover-up.</b>

34:33.011 --> 34:34.411
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- I love this tattoo.</b>

34:34.478 --> 34:35.880
<b>As far as meeting the challenge,</b>

34:35.947 --> 34:38.516
<b>I feel like</b>
<b>it has plenty of detail.</b>

34:38.583 --> 34:40.685
<b>- I think the hardest tattoo</b>
<b>to read what it is</b>

34:40.752 --> 34:42.487
<b>is Think Before You Ink's</b>
<b>tattoo.</b>

34:42.554 --> 34:43.855
<b>- I don't know what</b>
<b>you're talking about.</b>

34:43.922 --> 34:45.657
<b>- Can you really look</b>
<b>at that tattoo</b>

34:45.724 --> 34:47.458
<b>and know</b>
<b>what the hell's going on?</b>

34:47.525 --> 34:48.693
<b>- It's pretty dark.</b>

34:48.760 --> 34:49.828
<b>- It's 'cause</b>
<b>it's black as [bleep].</b>

34:49.895 --> 34:50.996
<b>- It's really not that black,</b>

34:51.062 --> 34:52.531
<b>and it's nowhere</b>
<b>near as black as theirs.</b>

34:52.597 --> 34:54.833
<b>- Ours is dark, but you can</b>
<b>tell it's a volcano,</b>

34:54.900 --> 34:56.368
<b>and theirs wraps around so much,</b>

34:56.434 --> 34:58.203
<b>you can't tell</b>
<b>what the challenge is.</b>

34:58.270 --> 34:59.938
<b>- Why did you guys</b>
<b>wrap it around, though?</b>

35:00.005 --> 35:01.673
<b>That's just a terrible idea</b>
<b>to begin with.</b>

35:01.740 --> 35:03.675
<b>- I can agree with the fact</b>
<b>that it's a problem</b>

35:03.742 --> 35:05.110
<b>that it's wrapped</b>
<b>around his arm.</b>

35:05.177 --> 35:07.112
<b>- There's a right</b>
<b>and wrong way to do things,</b>

35:07.179 --> 35:09.447
<b>and I feel like you guys</b>
<b>tattooed this the wrong way.</b>

35:09.514 --> 35:10.916
<b>- Our design was solid.</b>

35:10.982 --> 35:12.951
<b>Still had the detail,</b>
<b>we still showed a disaster,</b>

35:13.018 --> 35:15.220
<b>so I don't think</b>
<b>we really missed the mark.</b>

35:15.287 --> 35:17.722
<b>- Exactly.</b>

35:17.789 --> 35:20.592
<b>- Detail challenge,</b>
<b>natural disasters.</b>

35:20.659 --> 35:24.296
<b>This challenge was designed</b>
<b>to test Made Rich,</b>

35:24.362 --> 35:25.931
<b>and he may have</b>
<b>come back stronger,</b>

35:26.064 --> 35:28.667
<b>but I don't think he hit it</b>
<b>out of the park by any means.</b>

35:28.733 --> 35:30.402
<b>- No, no.</b>
<b>Everything looks the same.</b>

35:30.468 --> 35:31.970
<b>- They put details</b>
<b>in there, and then...</b>

35:32.070 --> 35:33.572
<b>- Hid them.</b>

35:33.638 --> 35:35.073
<b>- Disguised all the details</b>
<b>that they put into this piece.</b>

35:35.140 --> 35:36.441
<b>- But what I will say for</b>
<b>Made Rich,</b>

35:36.508 --> 35:38.443
<b>as far as the quality of</b>
<b>tattooing,</b>

35:38.510 --> 35:40.745
<b>this is a lot smoother</b>
<b>of a tattoo</b>

35:40.812 --> 35:41.913
<b>than we saw him do</b>
<b>last time he was here.</b>

35:41.980 --> 35:43.281
<b>- For sure.</b>

35:43.348 --> 35:45.450
<b>- But I think Tri-Cities</b>
<b>is in the bottom again.</b>

35:45.517 --> 35:47.452
<b>The big problem for me</b>
<b>is they're still having</b>

35:47.519 --> 35:49.888
<b>all these technical</b>
<b>application struggles.</b>

35:49.955 --> 35:52.557
<b>- But overall, you can at</b>
<b>least see what's going on here.</b>

35:52.624 --> 35:54.092
<b>I had a little bit</b>
<b>of a harder time</b>

35:54.092 --> 35:56.094
<b>seeing what's going</b>
<b>on in the Black Anchor tattoo.</b>

35:56.094 --> 35:58.096
<b>- This thing</b>
<b>is just a [bleep] storm.</b>

35:58.096 --> 35:59.464
<b>- There's no detail in this.</b>

35:59.531 --> 36:00.866
<b>- This is the big bummer</b>
<b>of the day,</b>

36:00.932 --> 36:02.534
<b>because I know</b>
<b>what they do at home.</b>

36:02.601 --> 36:05.270
<b>- But if any other tattoo shop</b>
<b>does that,</b>

36:05.337 --> 36:07.005
<b>then you have a field day</b>
<b>with them.</b>

36:07.105 --> 36:09.274
<b>I would be totally amazed</b>

36:09.341 --> 36:11.409
<b>if Black Anchor's</b>
<b>not picked for the jury.</b>

36:11.476 --> 36:12.744
<b>- It's gonna be</b>
<b>a tough decision.</b>

36:12.811 --> 36:13.745
<b>I wonder how they're gonna go.</b>

36:13.812 --> 36:15.113
<b>- Yeah.</b>

36:15.146 --> 36:16.281

<b>- I feel like it'll</b>
<b>just get harder and harder.</b>

36:21.620 --> 36:22.721
<b>- Yeah, it doesn't.</b>

36:22.787 --> 36:23.722
<b>I can tell you that</b>
<b>from experience.</b>

<b>we were trying to compare</b>

<b>the problems in each tattoo,</b>
<b>and we felt like--</b>

37:43.668 --> 37:46.505
<b>- So do you think the details in</b>
<b>Think Before You Ink</b>

37:46.571 --> 37:49.708
<b>are not as detailed</b>
<b>as in that volcano?</b>

37:49.774 --> 37:50.909
<b>- I mean,</b>
<b>look at the Ferris wheel.</b>

37:50.976 --> 37:53.678
<b>- It was a yes or</b>
<b>no question, champ.</b>

37:53.745 --> 37:55.947
<b>- I feel like ours is a</b>
<b>little bit more recognizable.</b>

37:56.081 --> 37:57.916
<b>- Y'all didn't have</b>
<b>any detail in that tattoo.</b>

37:57.983 --> 37:59.484
<b>- It's a little bit</b>
<b>more dynamic than yours.</b>

37:59.551 --> 38:00.785
<b>- Dynamic?</b>

38:00.852 --> 38:02.354
<b>It wasn't dynamic day;</b>
<b>it was detail day.</b>

38:02.420 --> 38:04.422
<b>- Black Anchor, this is a large,</b>

38:04.489 --> 38:06.825
<b>unappealing spot</b>
<b>on this guy's body.</b>

38:06.892 --> 38:08.493

<b>easily be added to that.</b>

<b>Back at the shop,</b>
<b>we do multiple scenes,</b>

<b>and I know that's not the case</b>
<b>this time--</b>

38:11.563 --> 38:12.831
<b>- This isn't back at the shop.</b>

<b>- We're judging on today,</b>
<b>and today it's just this</b>

<b>blocked-out mass with</b>
<b>no detail on detail day.</b>

38:19.137 --> 38:20.772
<b>- But if we did get another</b>
<b>shot,</b>

<b>pick ourselves out of this</b>
<b>slump,</b>

38:30.081 --> 38:31.416
<b>- Tri-Cities.</b>

38:31.483 --> 38:32.651
<b>Compared to the other people</b>
<b>in the room</b>

38:32.717 --> 38:35.153
<b>in small details,</b>
<b>you're outshined.</b>

38:35.220 --> 38:37.322
<b>- I just don't think our tattoo,</b>
<b>when you look at it--</b>

38:37.389 --> 38:40.225
<b>it's not questionable</b>
<b>as much as these two tattoos.</b>

38:40.292 --> 38:43.328
<b>- It's the one that's</b>
<b>the clearest to me of the three.</b>

38:43.395 --> 38:45.096
<b>- Perhaps,</b>
<b>but are we not judging on</b>

38:45.163 --> 38:46.665
<b>the worst tattoo of the day,</b>
<b>period?</b>

38:46.731 --> 38:48.066
<b>'Cause that's what</b>
<b>I thought I was here to do.</b>

38:48.066 --> 38:50.068
<b>- The technical</b>
<b>mistakes are pretty big.</b>

38:50.068 --> 38:51.536
<b>- But is it the worst?</b>

38:51.603 --> 38:53.238
<b>- Technically, I think</b>
<b>it's the worst-applied tattoo.</b>

38:53.305 --> 38:56.074
<b>- Technically it is,</b>
<b>but is it the worst?</b>

38:56.141 --> 38:58.243
<b>- We do need to</b>
<b>make a final decision.</b>

38:58.310 --> 39:00.846
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

39:00.912 --> 39:03.415
<b>- I'm gonna keep it 100% honest.</b>

39:03.481 --> 39:05.817
<b>I think Black Anchor</b>
<b>did the worst tattoo of the day.</b>

39:05.884 --> 39:07.853
<b>[music]</b>

39:07.919 --> 39:09.454
<b>- I got to stick</b>
<b>with Tri-Cities.</b>

39:09.521 --> 39:13.558
<b>[music]</b>

39:13.625 --> 39:17.162
<b>- My vote's for Black Anchor.</b>

39:17.229 --> 39:19.097
<b>The judges have decided.</b>

39:19.164 --> 39:24.302
<b>Black Anchor, you do not have</b>
<b>what it takes to be Master Shop.</b>

39:24.369 --> 39:25.537
<b>- Bummer, man.</b>

39:25.604 --> 39:27.639
<b>- If I was picking teams,</b>

39:27.706 --> 39:29.207
<b>I would have had you guys</b>
<b>first pick,</b>

39:29.274 --> 39:31.643
<b>but on any day,</b>
<b>worst tattoo goes.</b>

39:31.710 --> 39:33.311
<b>It doesn't matter</b>
<b>what you've done.</b>

39:33.378 --> 39:36.047
<b>- Please pack your</b>
<b>machines and move out.</b>

39:36.047 --> 39:41.353
<b>[music]</b>

39:41.419 --> 39:43.088
<b>- You think we</b>
<b>deserved to go home?</b>

39:43.154 --> 39:44.389
<b>- [bleep] no.</b>

39:44.456 --> 39:45.757
<b>What the [bleep]</b>
<b>went wrong?</b>

39:45.824 --> 39:47.325
<b>- Just a little bummed.</b>

39:47.392 --> 39:48.493
<b>I mean, I feel like we were</b>
<b>potentially one of the best</b>

39:48.560 --> 39:50.162
<b>ones here, and--</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

39:50.228 --> 39:52.931
<b>- I'm sure Tri-Cities is [bleep]</b>
<b>jumping with joy.</b>

39:53.064 --> 39:55.167
<b>Time was a huge issue</b>
<b>for us now.</b>

39:55.233 --> 39:58.236
<b>- It's just so compacted</b>
<b>into one [bleep] storm.</b>

39:58.303 --> 40:00.639
<b>- For us to get out</b>
<b>three challenges in, you know--</b>

40:00.705 --> 40:02.841
<b>- Challenges in.</b>
<b>Yeah. It's hard.</b>

40:02.908 --> 40:05.410
<b>Felt like we deserve way</b>
<b>more than we got credit for.</b>

40:05.477 --> 40:09.080
<b>- I'm a ride or die guy.</b>
<b>I stand by Black Anchor.</b>

40:09.147 --> 40:10.882
<b>- 100%.</b>

40:10.949 --> 40:15.854
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

40:15.921 --> 40:19.057
<b> <i>announcer: On the next</i> </b>
<b> <i>episode of "Ink Master"...</i> </b>

40:19.124 --> 40:21.326
<b>- Welcome the next</b>
<b>returning veterans.</b>

40:21.393 --> 40:24.763
<b>This is your chance to</b>
<b>fight for your shop. Take it.</b>

40:24.830 --> 40:26.097
<b>- I told myself I was gonna make</b>

40:26.164 --> 40:27.299
<b>your life a living hell,</b>
<b>'cause you [bleep] me.</b>

40:27.365 --> 40:28.600
<b>- [bleep] you.</b>

40:28.667 --> 40:29.601
<b>I'm coming for your [bleep]</b>
<b>neck every time.</b>

40:29.668 --> 40:30.869
<b>- Do that!</b>

40:30.936 --> 40:33.405
<b>- Time to separate</b>
<b>myself from my teammate.</b>

40:33.471 --> 40:35.440
<b>- Just go over those.</b>
<b>They're too thin.</b>

40:35.507 --> 40:38.510
<b>- I'm so far behind.</b>
<b>I am literally melting now.</b>

40:38.577 --> 40:41.646
<b>- It's the battle of</b>
<b>who's gonna [bleep] it up.</b>

40:41.713 --> 40:43.715
<b>- Some people are frustrated</b>
<b>with you, 'cause you get--</b>

40:43.782 --> 40:46.084
<b>- I don't care if you're</b>
<b>frustrated with me or not.</b>

40:46.151 --> 40:47.586
<b>Shut up.</b>

40:47.652 --> 40:48.720
<b>- It just looks messy.</b>

40:48.787 --> 40:50.856
<b>- [bleep] design.</b>
<b>This is jacked.</b>

40:50.922 --> 40:52.224
<b>- You can see a blowout.</b>

40:52.290 --> 40:53.225
<b>- Really rough.</b>
<b>- Get the hell out of here.</b>

40:53.291 --> 40:54.693
<b>- You're missing it on this.</b>

40:54.759 --> 40:56.061
<b>- These are the worst tattoos</b>
<b>that y'all got here.</b>
