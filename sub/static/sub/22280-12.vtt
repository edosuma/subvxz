00:15.667 --> 00:17.133
SUE: So my goal for the day,

00:17.167 --> 00:20.800
I want to keep my eye out
for overflow

00:20.833 --> 00:24.667
or pressure ridges in an area
that may, you know,

00:24.700 --> 00:27.033
that I might be able
to harvest some water.

00:35.200 --> 00:39.233
This might be not a bad little
section for getting water.

00:39.267 --> 00:41.733
You know, there's always
some water flowing in a river,

00:41.767 --> 00:43.933
no matter how much
ice is on it.

00:43.967 --> 00:46.333
Warmer temperatures come,
more water flows,

00:46.367 --> 00:47.933
it has to go somewhere.

00:47.967 --> 00:50.633
So it finds the weakest link
and that's where it flows.

00:50.667 --> 00:52.200
Sometimes there's
a big pressure ridge,

00:52.233 --> 00:54.800
you see a bubble up here,
seeping out.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.800
For me, this is
a little too dangerous,

00:57.833 --> 00:59.867
I don't, I don't wanna
cross here.

00:59.900 --> 01:02.600
What I wanna do
is just kind of follow along,

01:02.633 --> 01:05.267
see if there's a safe area
for me to go across,

01:05.300 --> 01:08.567
maybe I'll bust open
a water lead.

01:08.600 --> 01:11.233
It doesn't have to be deep.
It just has to be active.

01:12.133 --> 01:14.833
This, potentially deep
and active,

01:14.867 --> 01:16.967
there's just too much
danger involved.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.767
But if I can take the machine
and skate, skate,

01:19.800 --> 01:21.833
I might bust open
a little hole

01:21.867 --> 01:23.933
and then I'll go back,
get my little black sled,

01:23.967 --> 01:25.667
my totes,
and get some fresh water.

01:26.633 --> 01:27.733
That's a heck of a prize.

(ENGINE REVVING)

01:50.733 --> 01:52.767
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

02:14.833 --> 02:19.600
SUE: I tried to come across
this little section

02:19.633 --> 02:21.733
of the overflow.

02:21.767 --> 02:24.333
I thought that I could
just gun it and get through

02:24.367 --> 02:25.767
and break through the water.

02:25.800 --> 02:31.800
Unfortunately,
this intersection is much more
solid than I thought.

02:31.833 --> 02:35.133
Once the full snow machine
got on the ice

02:35.167 --> 02:39.800
and didn't break through,
then it went into a, you know,
just side spin.

02:39.833 --> 02:45.400
There's no recovery from that,
given the velocity.

02:45.433 --> 02:50.000
When I did hit, I remember
hitting the shoulder hard.

02:50.033 --> 02:53.567
It's not an opportune time

02:53.600 --> 02:57.033
to have made
such a stupid mistake.

03:00.633 --> 03:04.067
Now I need to get home
and get,

03:04.100 --> 03:08.867
just get warm and then take
another look at what's going
on with my body.

03:09.933 --> 03:12.067
Such a stupid mistake.

03:12.100 --> 03:14.267
I acted like a pork chop.

03:14.300 --> 03:15.733
I might be a pork chop.

03:22.767 --> 03:25.033
CHIP: Maybe the fish
will eat me
off the bottom of the river

03:25.067 --> 03:27.600
or the ravens will clear
my bones off on the tundra.

03:27.633 --> 03:29.633
We're part of the system.
We're part of all this.

03:29.667 --> 03:32.300
We just happen
to be lucky enough
to be the top predators.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.200
CHIP: I'm gonna go
check the traps. I'll be back.

03:41.233 --> 03:43.467
AGNES: Love you.
CHIP: Love you, too.

03:43.500 --> 03:45.100
NARRATOR: In Kiwalik,

03:45.133 --> 03:48.633
warming temperatures signal
the end of the Hailstones'
winter harvest.

03:48.667 --> 03:50.600
Before they return to Noorvik,

03:50.633 --> 03:52.867
they have one last chance
at trapping fur

03:52.900 --> 03:55.133
and hunting meat
for the spring.

03:56.867 --> 04:00.833
The weather is so bad
up on top of the mountains,
lately,

04:00.867 --> 04:03.233
that we've been forced
to stay down low.

04:03.267 --> 04:05.333
And down low here,
there's usually a lot of lynx.

04:05.367 --> 04:07.167
So we set lynx traps.

Fuck!

04:29.633 --> 04:31.767
Eh, I think it's
fucking locked up.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.933
My clutch don't want to move.

04:33.967 --> 04:35.433
It's either the rings
or the crank.

04:35.467 --> 04:37.333
Either the crank
is out of sync

04:37.367 --> 04:40.600
or I've got no piston pieces
that are holding it together.

04:40.633 --> 04:42.900
I'll tell you what could
really be worse,

04:42.933 --> 04:44.600
is that I could have been up
in the mountains

04:44.633 --> 04:47.600
or I could have been
ten miles.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.767
I'm just
around the corner.
(CHUCKLES)

04:51.800 --> 04:55.867
I'll just call it lucky today,
whatever luck this is.

04:55.900 --> 04:59.567
What I really don't want to do
is be broken down
when the caribou get here.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.567
Because that's when
all the fur arrives,

05:01.600 --> 05:03.100
that's when
all the meat is here.

05:03.133 --> 05:05.667
It's one of our most
productive times
in the spring.

05:05.700 --> 05:06.900
And if we lose out on that,

05:06.933 --> 05:08.600
then we have to buy food
at the store

you're walking?

-Well...
-I'm gonna make two into one.

05:38.867 --> 05:40.767
That's my plan.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.567
NARRATOR:
After a recent crash...

05:43.600 --> 05:47.100
Minor field repairs were made
to Agnes' snow machine.

05:47.133 --> 05:48.733
But with one machine down,

05:48.767 --> 05:52.400
they must now get the other
in full working condition.

05:52.433 --> 05:53.700
CHIP: So what's
the shorter cut?

05:53.733 --> 05:58.033
My gas tank on your ride,
or your engine in my ride?

05:58.067 --> 05:59.900
-Which one would be easier?
-Your gas tank.

05:59.933 --> 06:01.067
Exactly. So...

06:01.100 --> 06:04.833
I've been thinking about
this since I've been walking.

06:04.867 --> 06:06.200
I got nothing else
to think about.

06:07.767 --> 06:11.167
Since my machine's burned up
and hers has a good engine

06:11.200 --> 06:12.267
and will run,

06:12.300 --> 06:14.600
I'm gonna go straighten
out her handlebar

06:14.633 --> 06:17.667
and I'm gonna take her machine
and go drag my machine
back here.

06:17.700 --> 06:20.433
One or the other, I'm gonna
end up with a working ride.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.067
You know, this is how we live.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.767
We've been doing this
for 25 years.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.867
When things break down,
we try to keep
the ball rolling.

06:27.900 --> 06:30.500
We know our alternatives
and we try to switch
those alternatives.

06:36.533 --> 06:39.233
-So this is where it stopped?
-Yep.

06:39.267 --> 06:42.933
This is junk at the moment,
cause it doesn't run.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.767
It makes yours look beautiful.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.267
Okay.

living out in nature.

07:04.933 --> 07:06.433
And this is a place
where I can do it.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.367
There aren't that many places
left in the world

07:08.400 --> 07:09.667
where you can still live
this way.

07:09.700 --> 07:13.200
There's a connection out here
that I don't feel elsewhere.

07:25.167 --> 07:26.767
GLENN: This time of year,
here in the Brooks Range,

07:26.800 --> 07:29.733
it's late winter, early spring
and it starts getting warmer.

07:29.767 --> 07:32.167
Pretty soon the meat
that I have frozen

07:32.200 --> 07:34.400
will have to be dried in order
to preserve it.

07:34.433 --> 07:36.100
There's very limited space
in this cabin,

07:36.133 --> 07:39.167
so I need to make
a better system for drying
a larger quantity of meat.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.633
I can build a large rack
right out here in front
of the window.

07:41.667 --> 07:42.967
That way I can keep
an eye on it.

07:44.967 --> 07:47.700

of the things you need
to live right here.

to rising temperatures,

07:54.233 --> 07:57.300
Glenn must process
his winter meat supply
from his cache.

07:57.333 --> 08:00.167
But first, he will need
to build a new system

08:00.200 --> 08:03.867
that will allow the meat
to dry, or risk losing it
to spoilage.

08:08.667 --> 08:11.767
I'm gonna find four really
sturdy trees

08:11.800 --> 08:13.233
that I'm gonna cut logs from.

08:14.533 --> 08:15.767
As I'm walking
through the forest,

08:15.800 --> 08:19.033
I'm taking a good look
at the trees,
looking up at the tops.

08:19.067 --> 08:20.333
I'm looking
for just the right tree.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.633
Most of the trees here
are alive, they're healthy,

08:22.667 --> 08:24.167
I wouldn't want to cut those.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.067
That's what I'm looking for,
right there.

08:35.667 --> 08:36.933
Here it goes.

08:41.333 --> 08:43.033
I'm gonna cut down
another tree.

08:50.267 --> 08:51.600
There it goes!

08:54.700 --> 08:56.333
I got four now.

08:56.367 --> 08:59.000
Four logs for four legs
of the meat rack.

08:59.033 --> 09:01.467
Plus I got a few other poles
that I'll incorporate into it.

09:01.500 --> 09:04.267
I'm just gonna get these
back to camp.

09:08.167 --> 09:11.967
It's about 400 yards
from where I'm gonna
build this rack.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.800
I got a nice patch of ice
uncovered here,

09:13.833 --> 09:15.533
I'm gonna chisel some holes,

09:15.567 --> 09:18.800
and I'm gonna put the poles
in that are gonna be the legs
on this meat drying rack.

09:22.067 --> 09:23.567
I'm chiselling a hole here.

09:24.300 --> 09:26.967
The idea is to
secure this pole

09:27.000 --> 09:30.100
so that it makes one leg
for this meat drying rack.

09:30.133 --> 09:32.967
I wanna be able to put four
or five caribou up on here.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.400
I want it nice and sturdy.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.100
That should be
about deep enough.

09:42.500 --> 09:44.167
Beautiful.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.667
Now I'm gonna grab some water
out of my water hole here,

09:46.700 --> 09:48.833
dump it around that post,

09:50.067 --> 09:52.300
and freeze it into place.

09:55.367 --> 09:57.100
That water's gonna freeze
this pole in place.

09:57.133 --> 09:58.433
It'll be good and solid.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.733
It won't move an inch
once it freezes up.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.133
This rack will stand
right here

10:03.167 --> 10:05.267
until much later in the year
when the lake breaks up.

10:12.333 --> 10:13.567
Two up. Two to go.

10:13.600 --> 10:14.900
It's looking good.

10:14.933 --> 10:17.967
It's important that I can keep
an eye one this.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.167
Once I get the meat
out here on the rack,

10:20.200 --> 10:24.100
there are wolverines around,
there are wolves around.

10:24.133 --> 10:26.733
The bears are gonna
be coming out of hibernation.

10:27.367 --> 10:28.833
Oh, beautiful.

10:28.867 --> 10:32.167
Just fill it in
with ice chips, pour
water in it, let it freeze.

10:37.733 --> 10:40.067
I got the four legs
to my meat rack right here.

10:40.100 --> 10:41.367
In place.

10:41.400 --> 10:44.067
Leave them overnight,
they'll freeze tight,

10:44.100 --> 10:46.767
and tomorrow I'm gonna build
the framework to hang
the meat off

10:46.800 --> 10:48.400
and to protect the meat.

10:52.733 --> 10:55.100
GLENN: You know,
happiness is a odd thing.

10:55.133 --> 10:57.300
And it's,
it's not a tangible thing.

10:57.333 --> 11:00.900
It's very difficult to,
to know exactly how

11:00.933 --> 11:03.433
to measure happiness
and how to find happiness.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.600
I'm loading up the sled

11:16.633 --> 11:18.967
and we're gonna head up to

11:19.000 --> 11:21.567
see if we can't make it out
to Notellum Lake today

11:21.600 --> 11:23.967
and do a little bit
of ice fishing.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.767
ERIK: We're here right
at the end of winter,
the beginning of spring,

11:26.800 --> 11:27.967
so the Notellum River

11:28.000 --> 11:30.267
is really known
for having open water.

11:30.300 --> 11:33.067
So it's, it's kind of a place
you gotta, you gotta
watch out for.

11:33.100 --> 11:37.733
ERIK: The things that kills
you in Alaska is water,
bad ice, stuff like that.

11:37.767 --> 11:41.567
It's the quiet, subtle deaths
that aren't glorified
that really get people.

11:41.600 --> 11:45.200
It's about a 30-mile ride.
Shouldn't be too hard.

11:45.233 --> 11:47.533
The only thing we got
to worry about, really,

11:47.567 --> 11:50.967
is the condition of the ice
on the river
that we're taking.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.533
Hopefully we'll make it there
and come back
with a trash bag full of fish.

11:54.567 --> 11:55.833
We'll see.

11:55.867 --> 11:57.100
(ENGINE REVVING)

12:00.400 --> 12:01.533
Let's do it.

12:14.033 --> 12:16.767
ERIK: This time
of year the caribou
are migrating through,

12:16.800 --> 12:19.533
the birds are coming back,
the light's back,

12:19.567 --> 12:23.033
bitter temperatures are gone,
and it's also the end

12:23.067 --> 12:25.500
of the opportunity
to travel with snow.

12:26.767 --> 12:28.967
This time of year
with some warmer temperatures,

12:29.000 --> 12:32.333
it's a little bit of touch
and go travelling
to get there.

12:32.367 --> 12:35.633
The Notellum River is known
for a lot of overflow
and open water,

12:35.667 --> 12:37.933
you don't want to end up
drowning the sled.

12:37.967 --> 12:39.900
-MARTHA: Stop!
-Oh, shit.

12:41.433 --> 12:42.733
Look at all that overflow.

12:42.767 --> 12:44.633
MARTHA: Dangerous.

12:44.667 --> 12:47.400
ERIK: That's when
accidents happen.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.667
So we come up
on the Notellum River here

12:49.700 --> 12:51.700
on the way to go fishing

12:51.733 --> 12:52.967
and there's a little bit
of overflow.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.467
It's a condition where there's
water on top of the ice.

12:56.500 --> 12:59.200
In the springtime,
there's just open water places

12:59.233 --> 13:00.433
and it's flowing over
onto the ice.

13:00.467 --> 13:01.967
When you go into that,
you gotta be ready,

13:02.000 --> 13:05.233
you gotta be holding on,
and you gotta be ready
to throttle through it.

13:05.267 --> 13:07.467
These machines that have
a little bit more power,

13:07.500 --> 13:09.800
you can actually hydroplane
across most of it.

13:09.833 --> 13:12.567
But if you let up,
you're in big trouble.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.400
Are we gonna rally
through this?

13:14.433 --> 13:16.033
Yeah, just stand up with me
and hold on.

13:19.033 --> 13:20.700
(ENGINE REVVING)

13:33.600 --> 13:34.633
ERIK: Woo!

13:34.667 --> 13:35.900
All right!

13:45.967 --> 13:48.467
What do you think, honey?
You want to give it a go here?

13:48.500 --> 13:50.967
Is this a good spot?
I guess we'll find out.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.700
Let's start digging holes.

13:53.533 --> 13:54.667
(MOTOR STARTS)

13:56.367 --> 13:57.533
(WHIRRING)

14:05.633 --> 14:07.100
(WHIRRING CONTINUES)

14:15.033 --> 14:16.400
MARTHA: Is it good?

14:17.100 --> 14:18.467
Four holes.

14:20.167 --> 14:22.433
I'm just rigging up
my tip ups here.

14:22.467 --> 14:25.900
Take this bait,
put it on the hook,

14:25.933 --> 14:29.167
and I'm gonna go place
my first tip ups.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.400
NARRATOR: With spring
on the horizon,

14:32.433 --> 14:34.400
softer ice affords
Erik and Martha

14:34.433 --> 14:37.500
the opportunity to catch fish
under the frozen river.

14:38.200 --> 14:41.667
Flag, bend it over,

14:41.700 --> 14:44.367
and just hook it on that.

14:44.400 --> 14:47.567
That way when the fish
starts taking the bait,

14:49.467 --> 14:50.533
the flag goes up.

14:50.567 --> 14:52.000
That means fish on.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.000
MARTHA: Since I wasn't raised
around tip ups,

14:55.033 --> 14:56.767
it's something totally
foreign to me.

14:56.800 --> 14:59.933
I'd rather fish with
sight or feel,

14:59.967 --> 15:01.967
than just watching
a flag go up.

15:03.067 --> 15:04.633
I grew up
in a fishing community.

15:04.667 --> 15:06.033
We were always fishing.

15:06.067 --> 15:08.933
Winter, summer,
whenever you could.

15:08.967 --> 15:10.633
This is what I love to do.

15:10.667 --> 15:12.533
This is my favourite
place to be.

15:18.800 --> 15:21.533
ERIK: It's hard to be patient
out here in the cold
and sit still.

15:21.567 --> 15:23.733
I hope there's some fish
to catch after all of this.

15:24.700 --> 15:26.867
It's either a slam-dunk
or nothing.

15:26.900 --> 15:29.200
We'll either do
really well fishing

15:29.233 --> 15:31.467
or for whatever reason
we'll strike out.

15:31.500 --> 15:33.933
See what the fishing gods
have in store for us.

15:37.900 --> 15:39.533
CHIP: You gotta
think it through.

15:39.567 --> 15:41.267
You gotta give it a try.

15:41.300 --> 15:43.400
And if you screw it up
or if you do it right,

15:43.433 --> 15:44.967
either way you ought to
learn something.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.800
NARRATOR: It is crucial
that the Hailstones

16:02.833 --> 16:05.333
get one snow machine
in safe working order,

16:05.367 --> 16:10.233
not only to hunt caribou,
but also to return home
to Noorvik safely.

16:10.267 --> 16:11.933
CHIP: It could be that crank
was in half.

16:11.967 --> 16:13.767
It could be a ring
that's stuck.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.167
Let's have a look.

16:16.167 --> 16:17.833
Yeah, it's got metal
all over it.

16:19.767 --> 16:22.100
Look at it glisten.
There you go.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.433
I got metal on my spark plug.
It's toasted.

16:26.467 --> 16:28.033
So it's not gonna do me
any good.

16:28.067 --> 16:30.467
But I'll use it
for spare parts for right now.

16:30.500 --> 16:32.267
As long as we're diligent,
and we get with it,

16:32.300 --> 16:34.433
and we get our stuff on,
my wife will have a good ride.

16:34.467 --> 16:36.067
I'll scrap mine till summer

16:36.100 --> 16:37.367
and then figure
something else out.

16:37.400 --> 16:38.800
We really can't live
for tomorrow,

16:38.833 --> 16:40.600
we gotta think of today,
cause today's happening.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.267
The cruel irony of it all,

16:42.300 --> 16:44.900
the best weather
has just suddenly arrived
within the last few hours.

16:44.933 --> 16:47.233
The weather
we've been waiting for.

16:47.267 --> 16:49.233
The weather that's kept us low
in the river

16:49.267 --> 16:51.500
and looking for lynx
now has cleared up

16:51.533 --> 16:53.367
and we'll certainly be able
to get to the caribou,

16:53.400 --> 16:55.467
and the wolves,
and the wolverines.

16:55.500 --> 16:58.633
Lucky woman got
a quarter tank of gas now.

16:58.667 --> 17:02.000
Mechanicals up here
can be a long time fixing.

17:02.033 --> 17:05.200
When one machine is down,
we can continue on
while we fix the other one.

17:06.567 --> 17:07.833
That's how we've always
done it

17:07.867 --> 17:09.267
and that's the way
we want it to always be.

17:09.300 --> 17:11.667
My wife decided it was time
to cook some dinner.

17:11.700 --> 17:14.567
She gets a little frustrated
with things like crashes
and repairs.

17:14.600 --> 17:17.467
And we're right on the verge
of like excellent hunting

17:17.500 --> 17:20.000
and look what's
happened to us.

17:20.033 --> 17:22.633
AGNES: Snow machines
are very important
to us up here.

17:22.667 --> 17:24.633
They're just
an all-around tool.

17:24.667 --> 17:28.833
We use them to haul stuff,
move things, gather things,

17:28.867 --> 17:30.633
pretty much everything.

17:30.667 --> 17:34.200
CHIP: You have no choice.
You have no control
over mechanical things.

17:34.233 --> 17:36.833
We're not the kind of people
that want broken machines,
believe me.

17:36.867 --> 17:39.700
We're the kind of people
that want this shit
working now.

17:41.533 --> 17:45.167
Well, we're getting closer
and the gas tank is going on.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.100
We'll get all this stuff
bolted back together,

17:47.133 --> 17:49.633
and fire her up,
and get the wife happy again.

17:49.667 --> 17:50.833
There.

17:51.433 --> 17:52.467
Okay.

17:55.300 --> 17:57.733
I took two machines
and made one.

17:57.767 --> 17:59.500
There you go!
Tested and proved.

18:00.333 --> 18:01.733
We are back on the road

18:01.767 --> 18:03.333
and now we have a pile
of parts to choose from.

18:09.433 --> 18:12.967
(AGNES SPEAKING)

18:13.000 --> 18:14.967
CHIP: Now at least we got
a machine going.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.300
And we got no problems,
no worries.

18:16.333 --> 18:19.000
We'll sleep good tonight
and tomorrow we hunt.

18:19.033 --> 18:20.967
-This will work.
-Yes, it will.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.367
We're back in action.

18:22.400 --> 18:25.867
(CHUCKLES) Yes, that's how
it ought to be.

18:25.900 --> 18:28.700

always work through, huh?

SUE: It's a domino effect.

18:35.300 --> 18:37.033
One part of the system
goes down...

18:37.067 --> 18:39.200
Boom, boom, boom, boom!
So does the rest.

Sue called upon her friend
and pilot, Bob Gill,

19:01.467 --> 19:04.533
to fly her to Deadhorse
for medical attention.

19:04.567 --> 19:07.467

gonna come off the stool.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.200
BOB: You're doing it.
You're good.

19:09.233 --> 19:12.167
You finally touched my ass
after how many years, Bob?

19:12.200 --> 19:13.967
And I have to be in pain
and I can't enjoy it.

19:15.500 --> 19:18.100
SUE: I'm really grateful
that Bob is here right now.

19:20.300 --> 19:23.933
I can't relax my arm.
I can't move.

19:23.967 --> 19:26.700
I can't have any kind of force
or torque on it

19:26.733 --> 19:31.400
without feeling like
I'm having a heart attack
or something.

19:31.433 --> 19:36.300
SUE: My life is absolutely
dependent on my ability
to get my chores done.

19:36.333 --> 19:38.300
And done by myself.

19:39.833 --> 19:41.600
If I can't maintain my body

19:41.633 --> 19:43.400
and I can't get
my body to work,

19:43.433 --> 19:45.233
then the whole thing,
the whole structure of my life

19:45.267 --> 19:47.167
is gonna fall apart
at the seams.

20:00.233 --> 20:01.567
Where to now?

20:01.600 --> 20:03.133
-It's over here.
-Okay.

20:03.167 --> 20:04.700
SUE: So here I am
in Deadhorse.

20:04.733 --> 20:07.933
I just got done seeing,
getting seen at the clinic.

20:07.967 --> 20:09.333
And the x-rays show that

20:09.367 --> 20:12.400
what I've done is,
you have a bone
called the clavicle

20:12.433 --> 20:14.700
or the collarbone.

20:14.733 --> 20:19.067
And under
the right circumstances,
you can break that.

20:20.233 --> 20:23.500
What apparently happened
when I hit,

20:23.533 --> 20:28.300
the pressure broke it
and then drove it
all the way up.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.533
SUE:
They are thinking possibly
surgical intervention,

20:38.567 --> 20:41.700
so they are now referring me
to go down to Fairbanks

20:41.733 --> 20:46.800
and I have to see
the emergency room there,
an orthopaedic surgeon.

20:49.667 --> 20:52.433
I need to know the extent
of the injuries.

20:52.467 --> 20:55.133
I need to know
what the resolution is.

20:55.167 --> 20:58.033
I've got to find some way
to handle camp

20:58.067 --> 21:00.167
and shut it down
if I can't be there.

21:00.200 --> 21:04.300
Any one of these things
takes too long,
and I've lost my camp.

21:04.333 --> 21:06.833
And I don't even know
what to say about that.

21:06.867 --> 21:09.667
Getting better
has to be a priority

21:09.700 --> 21:12.367
but if I take all the time
necessary to get better,

21:12.400 --> 21:14.833
I won't have anything
to get better for.

21:15.900 --> 21:16.967
Yay!

21:19.467 --> 21:21.900
Day two comes to a close.

21:23.433 --> 21:25.900
GLENN: I'm just a person
that doesn't really like

21:25.933 --> 21:29.167
to have the future
all planned out
and nailed down.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.900
I like the way nature goes.

21:30.933 --> 21:34.233
There's certain cycles
and rhythms,
but it's different every year.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.900
NARRATOR: To preserve
his food supply,

21:48.933 --> 21:50.433
Glenn is building
a drying rack

21:50.467 --> 21:53.067
that will protect
the caribou meat from spoilage

21:53.100 --> 21:55.667
as temperatures rise
in the Brooks Range.

21:55.700 --> 21:58.100
GLENN: I've got the four legs
to the meat rack here

21:58.133 --> 21:59.333
frozen into the ice.

21:59.367 --> 22:00.767
Now I need to build
a framework

22:00.800 --> 22:05.100
between them on the top
in order to support the roof.

22:05.133 --> 22:08.467
I've got enough caribou meat
to last me right through
the summer this year.

22:08.500 --> 22:09.800
Just a matter
of preserving it.

22:09.833 --> 22:11.867
And the only way I have
to preserve it is to dry it.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.600
It's nice and sturdy.

22:15.633 --> 22:18.067
I should be able to hang four
or five caribou on this
if I want to.

22:18.100 --> 22:19.533
No problem at all.

22:21.267 --> 22:24.533
GLENN: Now I'm gonna put
a couple more horizontal poles

22:24.567 --> 22:27.433
perpendicular
to these first two.

22:27.467 --> 22:29.833
That's all to put
the roof on top of.

22:29.867 --> 22:33.133
I'm gonna cover it with a tarp
just to keep precipitation
off of it.

22:33.167 --> 22:35.800
Snow, I don't want snow
all over the meat.

22:35.833 --> 22:38.967
I've got this square now
built on top of the four legs

22:39.000 --> 22:40.533
and the next step
is to put a ridge pole

22:40.567 --> 22:43.367
across the middle of it
that's gonna support the ridge
of the roof.

22:43.400 --> 22:46.100
I've got this log
that would work beautifully.

22:48.333 --> 22:49.733
But it's heavy.

22:49.767 --> 22:53.267
The question is whether or not
I can lift it up there.

22:55.967 --> 22:58.533
I'm not sure If I can
just lift it into place
or not,

22:58.567 --> 22:59.733
it's a heavy log.

23:02.200 --> 23:04.067
Not where I want it.

23:08.467 --> 23:09.633
There.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.433
Next I'm gonna
lash the ridge pole

23:12.467 --> 23:14.133
to the horizontal poles
it's sitting on

23:14.167 --> 23:15.367
so it doesn't
roll out of place.

23:16.767 --> 23:18.667
When you're building
things simply,

23:18.700 --> 23:21.467
like just working out here
in the bush in general,

23:21.500 --> 23:25.167
tying things up is a skill
that comes in handy.

23:26.333 --> 23:27.967
I froze the poles in place
with ice.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.033
Just notched them together
and tied them up
with a little bit of rope.

23:31.067 --> 23:33.633
It's simple technology,
but it's very functional.

23:37.800 --> 23:40.167
GLENN: Of course
you can accomplish more.

23:40.200 --> 23:43.200
You can build things bigger
and faster,

23:43.233 --> 23:44.667
if you use power tools.

23:44.700 --> 23:47.300
But then I'd have to have
fuel out here.

23:48.600 --> 23:52.000
I'd have to have
everything on a larger scale.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.167
A considerable amount of work
goes into making
the meat drying rack,

23:57.200 --> 23:58.700
but I'll be able
to use this again.

23:58.733 --> 24:01.433
After this year I'll be able
to take it down,
save the parts,

24:01.467 --> 24:03.233
and put it back up
another year.

24:04.733 --> 24:06.367
The sun just set
so I'm gonna call it a day.

24:06.400 --> 24:09.067
I'm gonna go in,
have a bite to eat,
go to sleep, get up tomorrow,

24:09.100 --> 24:11.667
and finish building this rack
and get some meat
hanging up on it.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.067
Looks pretty good.

24:15.833 --> 24:18.900
AGNES: We have a very
different way of life here.

24:20.733 --> 24:24.600
We have a very different way
of doing things.

24:24.633 --> 24:26.100
We're cache and carry people.

24:26.133 --> 24:27.500
We like to do
things ourselves.

24:27.533 --> 24:29.233
We like to carry
our own loads.

24:34.300 --> 24:37.433
CHIP: You got some spare ammo
in your pockets?

24:37.467 --> 24:40.433
My wife toasted her machine.
My machine burned up.

24:40.467 --> 24:43.833
We made two into one.
And we can hunt some more.

24:43.867 --> 24:45.267
NARRATOR: For the Hailstones,

24:45.300 --> 24:47.267
weeks of fog
and low visibility

24:47.300 --> 24:49.667
have prevented caribou hunting
in Kiwalik.

24:49.700 --> 24:52.500
But a break in the weather
has given them one last chance

24:52.533 --> 24:55.967
at harvesting red meat
before the trip home.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.033
AGNES: Caribou, they can see
the snow machine coming
from a long ways.

24:59.067 --> 25:00.800
In the wide open country
like this

25:00.833 --> 25:02.467
it's a little hard
to get close to them.

25:03.833 --> 25:07.033
They're walking that way
so we're just gonna go
this direction.

25:07.067 --> 25:09.167
It's gonna be closer.

25:09.200 --> 25:11.500
CHIP: It's not easy,
it's never easy
to shoot in the wind.

25:11.533 --> 25:14.467
And then of course caribou
don't hang around,
they're usually moving.

25:14.500 --> 25:16.100
So when you have
a moving target

25:16.133 --> 25:18.500
and you have a wind
moving with it
or wind moving against it,

25:18.533 --> 25:20.067
the variables can stack up.

25:20.100 --> 25:23.067
And thinking through that shot
can be quite a challenge.

25:25.300 --> 25:26.433
CHIP: Go ahead.

25:26.467 --> 25:27.900
Aim at the nose
and pull the trigger.

25:27.933 --> 25:28.933
(GUN FIRES)

25:31.367 --> 25:33.000
CHIP: They're coming to us
right here.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.667
Stand up!

25:35.700 --> 25:37.367
There you go!
Right there!

25:38.333 --> 25:39.633
Keep the barrel swinging.

25:39.667 --> 25:40.700
There you go!
Right there!

25:47.300 --> 25:48.833
AGNES: Come on, Mr Caribou.

25:48.867 --> 25:50.000
(GUN FIRES)

25:50.033 --> 25:51.200
(AGNES CHEERS)

25:51.233 --> 25:52.933
Good shot, Agnes.

25:52.967 --> 25:56.333
Sometimes the weather,
sometimes the wind,

25:56.367 --> 25:57.833
sometimes just...

25:59.533 --> 26:01.667
You don't know
why they're not connecting.

26:01.700 --> 26:03.467
But just gotta keep trying.

26:03.500 --> 26:04.867
Hey! There it is!

26:04.900 --> 26:06.300
Ah!

26:06.333 --> 26:07.567
CHIP: I'm gonna
work this animal.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.667
Agnes will walk up
and go get the snow machine.

26:09.700 --> 26:11.500
(CHUCKLES) Fat!

26:14.400 --> 26:16.000
-Really?
-Chubby!

26:16.033 --> 26:18.333
That makes
my whole day better.

26:19.067 --> 26:20.533
Success generally does.

26:20.567 --> 26:23.033
AGNES: Nothing like
fat caribou.

26:23.067 --> 26:25.600
My wife shot this caribou
and I'm pretty freaking happy.

26:25.633 --> 26:27.533
I mean, we had a few
set ups today

26:27.567 --> 26:30.967
and where we live,
the ranges are far, and wide,
and long.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.400
You know, we don't have
trees filling in here.

26:33.433 --> 26:34.833
So, so we have
to be persistent.

26:34.867 --> 26:36.833
Just keep after it
and keep after it.

26:36.867 --> 26:38.333
This is the game of life
and death.

26:38.367 --> 26:40.600
We have to catch caribou
if we wanna live.

26:40.633 --> 26:44.167
To us, the efficiency
of getting the food
and doing more with less

26:44.200 --> 26:46.100
has got a lot to do
with respecting the animals,

26:46.133 --> 26:48.867
using them to their fullest,
and not depleting them.

26:48.900 --> 26:51.833
So if you go out
and you catch them

26:51.867 --> 26:53.133
and you honour the animal,

26:53.167 --> 26:55.200
and I don't mean
the individual animal,

26:55.233 --> 26:57.567
but the animal itself,
such as a caribou.

26:57.600 --> 27:00.933
And you treat them
with respect in the way that
you go about using them,

27:00.967 --> 27:03.100
and the way that you go
about treating them,

27:03.133 --> 27:04.533
and the way you go
about hunting them,

27:04.567 --> 27:06.567
and not in a wasteful manner,

27:06.600 --> 27:09.167
then you've treated them
with respect

27:09.200 --> 27:10.533
and everything is good.

27:15.567 --> 27:17.567
AGNES: I'm happy
with today's outcome.

27:17.600 --> 27:18.833
It took a lot of time.

27:18.867 --> 27:21.900
We walked a few miles,
we stood there

27:21.933 --> 27:25.500
and waited patiently,
and we were successful.

27:25.533 --> 27:28.233
-(AGNES SPEAKING)
-Yeah, it is.

27:28.267 --> 27:30.133
CHIP: Look at that,
even got menses fat.

27:30.167 --> 27:32.000
(AGNES SPEAKING)

27:32.033 --> 27:34.000
Yeah. You picked
a good one to shoot.

27:34.033 --> 27:35.467
When you're shooting
straight downhill,

27:35.500 --> 27:39.067
you take out all that range
and all that ballistic curve.

27:39.100 --> 27:40.800
It becomes very straight.

27:40.833 --> 27:42.267
And once she had
that figured out,

27:42.300 --> 27:44.967
she was zeroed in
and we had caribou.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.233
AGNES: Wait, wait.
CHIP: Okay.

27:46.267 --> 27:49.433
(AGNES SPEAKING)

27:49.467 --> 27:51.000
-One, two, three.
-Two, three, go!

27:52.500 --> 27:54.467
Even though I had
to keep reloading

27:54.500 --> 27:58.300
and keep shooting,
the effort turned out
wonderful.

27:58.333 --> 28:01.867
We have good, fat meat
and a choice cow.

28:01.900 --> 28:03.400
You have to try to pick,

28:03.433 --> 28:05.833
especially when you go
the long distances you go,

28:05.867 --> 28:09.600
you don't want to just get
any old caribou, a sick one
or a skinny one.

28:09.633 --> 28:14.400
You wanna try to pick one
that's fat and gonna be
worth all the effort.

28:14.433 --> 28:16.033
So we're happy today.

28:16.733 --> 28:19.333
CHIP: All right!

28:19.367 --> 28:22.100
CHIP: To me,
the meat is the trophy.
The health is the trophy.

28:22.133 --> 28:23.700
The adventure is the trophy.

28:28.100 --> 28:31.567
SUE: As I get older,
I'm finding that I break
instead of bend.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.600
As we get older, we fracture.

28:33.633 --> 28:36.133
At 50 there's
only so many times I can break

28:36.167 --> 28:38.900
before I can't,
I can't spring back up.

28:45.833 --> 28:49.100
NARRATOR:
Sue has travelled to Fairbanks
to consult with a surgeon.

28:49.133 --> 28:53.467
And the future
of her way of life in Kavik
depends on the diagnosis.

28:55.500 --> 28:58.700
I did notice today
that the tingling went down

28:58.733 --> 29:01.333
into my fingers
on the right hand side.

29:02.533 --> 29:06.667
And it feels very,
it's just nerve stuff.

29:06.700 --> 29:08.767
I'm not feeling happy
about it.

29:11.700 --> 29:15.467
I'm finally getting in to see
the orthopaedic surgeon.

29:15.500 --> 29:20.367
My goal today is hopefully
find out if and when
we're gonna do the surgery.

29:20.400 --> 29:24.467
In the back of my mind,
camp is still sitting there.

29:24.500 --> 29:28.133
This injury definitely
is going to impact my future
at Kavik.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.067
I just simply don't know
how much.

29:30.100 --> 29:33.033
There is no doubt
that it will.

29:33.067 --> 29:36.133
And I had said, I get hurt
one more good time,
I may be done.

29:36.167 --> 29:38.467
And here we go.

29:38.500 --> 29:40.933
Today is gonna prepare me
for the rest of my life.

29:45.067 --> 29:47.633
The biggest thing
is your collarbone
took the brunt.

29:47.667 --> 29:49.533
Yeah, the shoulder
and collarbone,

29:49.567 --> 29:51.233
it hurts like for me
to sit here

29:51.267 --> 29:52.933
you're gonna notice
in a minute or two I gotta
get up and walk around.

29:52.967 --> 29:54.333
-You gotta stand.
-Yeah.

29:54.367 --> 29:56.667
Here's the thing,
there is some findings
on that X-Ray

29:56.700 --> 29:58.200
that are a little bit
concerning.

29:58.233 --> 30:00.100
Your clavicle is overlapped
almost five centimetres.

30:00.133 --> 30:01.300
Uh-huh.

30:01.333 --> 30:04.333
So what I gotta do
is get these to kind of
key back in.

30:04.367 --> 30:08.400
The risks of the surgery
are minimal

30:08.433 --> 30:11.167
compared to the benefits
in this particular case.

30:11.600 --> 30:12.700
Any questions?

30:12.733 --> 30:13.967
Nope. When do we do it?

30:14.000 --> 30:15.167
-Tomorrow.
-When?

30:15.200 --> 30:16.600
-It will be in the afternoon.
-Okay.

30:16.633 --> 30:18.267
I don't know exactly the time.

30:18.300 --> 30:20.467
So can I eat or drink
water today?

30:20.500 --> 30:21.900
Yes, up until midnight.

30:21.933 --> 30:23.933
How long do you think
I am going to be in Fairbanks?

30:23.967 --> 30:26.267
For me I definitely want you
here for at least two weeks.

30:26.300 --> 30:28.467
Because if you're gonna
have any postoperative
complications

30:28.500 --> 30:30.800
it usually happens
within the first 14 days.

30:30.833 --> 30:32.833
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-All right. Thank you.

30:32.867 --> 30:35.100
Oh, careful. (GROANS)

30:35.133 --> 30:37.833
SUE: If I don't get surgery
I can't use my right arm.

30:37.867 --> 30:40.267
If I have the surgery,
again, I don't know.

30:40.300 --> 30:42.900
They said minimum
six weeks recovery time.

30:42.933 --> 30:45.467
I am not quite sure
what that does for my future.

30:45.500 --> 30:49.467
But if I have to
shut Kavik down
will I be able to open?

30:50.833 --> 30:54.233
If I can't open,
I have to sell.

30:59.167 --> 31:01.600
GLENN: It's not all adventure
and excitement,

31:01.633 --> 31:03.833
it's, a lot of times,
really quiet out here.

31:03.867 --> 31:05.333
That's what I really enjoy
about it,

31:05.367 --> 31:08.900
is the peace and quiet
and meditative aspect of it.

31:22.733 --> 31:25.800
This is the last
group of poles I am gonna need
for the meat drying rack.

31:25.833 --> 31:28.667
These are the poles
that the meat's actually
going to hang off of.

31:28.700 --> 31:31.367
NARRATOR: Using only his
surrounding resources,

31:31.400 --> 31:34.367
Glenn is in the final stages
of building a drying rack,

31:34.400 --> 31:37.733
which will preserve
his meat supply
for the months ahead.

31:37.767 --> 31:39.967
GLENN: Since the meat's going
to be hanging off of these,

31:40.000 --> 31:41.700
I am going to clean them up
a little bit.

31:41.733 --> 31:44.467
Otherwise, the part
of the meat touching the poles
is going to be all dirty.

31:44.500 --> 31:48.667
I've built things
with power tools in the past,
of course.

31:48.700 --> 31:51.633
But I really prefer working
with hand tools.

31:53.233 --> 31:58.433
It's a slower pace
and just allows me
to take my time,

31:58.467 --> 32:00.667
listen to what's
going on around me.

32:00.700 --> 32:04.167
It's very meditative
working with hand tools

32:04.200 --> 32:08.400
and doing most of the jobs
out here are very meditative
for me.

32:08.433 --> 32:11.900
I got a dozen poles,
plenty of space
to dry meat here.

32:11.933 --> 32:14.033
Just need to throw
a tarp over it

32:14.067 --> 32:15.767
and start hanging some meat
on this rack.

32:19.800 --> 32:22.367
GLENN: Dried meat
is very light
and very portable.

32:22.400 --> 32:25.800
It's good food
when you're travelling.
It's a staple of my diet.

32:25.833 --> 32:27.233
It takes time.

32:27.267 --> 32:28.967
I'll leave the meat out here
for weeks.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.433
But then it will be completely
dry and well preserved.

32:32.467 --> 32:34.500
I'll be able to keep it
as long as I want.

32:34.533 --> 32:36.100
It will last for years.

32:36.133 --> 32:37.800
I got my roof on.

32:37.833 --> 32:39.467
Got my rack here.

32:40.100 --> 32:41.467
It's looking nice.

32:41.500 --> 32:42.833
All I need is my meat.

32:47.900 --> 32:50.300
This is a back leg
of a caribou

32:50.333 --> 32:53.067
with the hide on it,
just to protect the meat.

32:53.100 --> 32:55.933
I'm going to skin it now
and I am going to cut it up

32:55.967 --> 32:57.667
and hang it on my drying rack.

32:58.567 --> 32:59.833
And then that meat,

32:59.867 --> 33:03.567
which wouldn't have lasted
more than a few more weeks,

33:03.600 --> 33:06.533
can last me well into summer.

33:06.567 --> 33:09.500
In order to dry it, it has
to be cut into thin pieces.

33:09.533 --> 33:11.967
The trick is to cut it
pretty thin,

33:12.000 --> 33:15.267
but you want it still
to be strong.

33:15.300 --> 33:17.500
I don't want it falling off
my meat rack.

33:17.533 --> 33:19.367
So I just took that
one thick muscle,

33:19.400 --> 33:23.733
and I just cut it
into a thinner piece
that'll freeze-dry.

33:25.167 --> 33:27.033
First piece of meat
on the rack.

33:28.167 --> 33:29.267
Nice.

33:30.433 --> 33:32.133
Sun's back now.

33:32.167 --> 33:35.633
Special time of the year,
a lot of birds are gonna
be coming back soon.

33:35.667 --> 33:37.367
It's been a really good time
out here this year.

33:37.400 --> 33:39.100
Got a moose in the fall.

33:39.133 --> 33:42.067
I really enjoy interacting
with all the animals,

33:42.100 --> 33:46.367
the wildlife,
being part of the cycles,
the cycle of the seasons.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.767
You just get more and more
in tune to what's happening,

33:48.800 --> 33:51.933
what's going on,
understanding the way
nature works.

33:51.967 --> 33:54.500
And understanding
how to live in it.

33:56.833 --> 33:59.800
I live out here
because I really enjoy
this lifestyle.

33:59.833 --> 34:01.467
I enjoy the autonomy
it affords,

34:01.500 --> 34:03.300
I enjoy the competence
it demands.

34:03.333 --> 34:05.667
I like the connection
to nature I feel

34:05.700 --> 34:07.267
when I live the way I do here.

34:07.300 --> 34:09.800
It's one of the most
special places

34:09.833 --> 34:11.833
that I've ever been to
in the world,

34:11.867 --> 34:13.967
and it's the place
I consider home.

34:15.900 --> 34:18.567
ERIK: I don't know really
all the answers in life.

34:18.600 --> 34:19.667
I'm only 31.

34:19.700 --> 34:21.700
I'm learning not knowing,
as they say,

34:21.733 --> 34:23.633
but there's a lot to be said

34:23.667 --> 34:25.533
for kinda kicking back
on the porch

34:25.567 --> 34:28.100
and drinking a cup coffee
and looking at the hills.

34:36.167 --> 34:39.867
There's all kinds of critters
running around here
in the springtime.

34:39.900 --> 34:41.833
You never know
what you're going to see,

34:41.867 --> 34:45.900
always good to
keep a look out
and be aware.

34:45.933 --> 34:48.367
MARTHA: No sign of fish yet.

34:48.400 --> 34:51.300
Erik got anxious
to do something
and he wandered off,

34:51.333 --> 34:53.467
I don't know if he
spotted something or what.

34:53.500 --> 34:58.933
NARRATOR: The Salitans have
set bait under the river ice
in hopes of catching fish.

34:58.967 --> 35:01.567
While they wait,
Erik scours the area

35:01.600 --> 35:05.333
for any alternative food
sources that cross his path.

35:05.367 --> 35:07.433
Martha is over there
by the holes

35:07.467 --> 35:09.067
and doing some jiggin',

35:09.100 --> 35:11.033
I've just seen some ptarmigan
over here

35:11.067 --> 35:12.767
and got my .22
trapping pistol.

35:12.800 --> 35:14.667
Let's see if we can't get
a ptarmigan for supper.

35:27.300 --> 35:28.800
We've been here
a couple hours,

35:28.833 --> 35:32.400
and haven't caught
any fish yet,
but still trying.

35:32.433 --> 35:34.100
Still got hooks in the water.

35:39.933 --> 35:43.933
ERIK: The flag goes up,
I can run over there
and attend to my line.

35:43.967 --> 35:45.733
It's kind of like killing
two birds with one stone.

35:45.767 --> 35:47.067
Ha-ha.

35:55.867 --> 35:58.533
There's a couple of ptarmigan
right along these willows
right here,

35:58.567 --> 36:01.100
let's see if I can't shoot one
or two of them.

36:04.800 --> 36:05.800
(GUN FIRES)

36:15.933 --> 36:18.833
I got one ptarmigan
and I just shot another one
over here.

36:18.867 --> 36:21.200
That's one for Martha,
one for me.

36:21.233 --> 36:23.167
The fish may
or may not be biting,

36:23.200 --> 36:25.700
but no matter what,
we're gonna have
a good supper.

36:27.433 --> 36:29.867
ERIK: Did you catch dinner?

36:29.900 --> 36:32.167
MARTHA: No,
I didn't catch dinner.
What do you got there?

36:32.200 --> 36:33.833
I caught dinner.

36:33.867 --> 36:36.567
-Looks like some ptarmigan.
-Yeah.

36:36.600 --> 36:38.767
Let's go back to the house
and eat some ptarmigan.

36:38.800 --> 36:40.933
Yeah, we'll try another day,
we'll come fish another day.

36:40.967 --> 36:42.200
Went on a little hike.

36:42.233 --> 36:43.500
Caught a couple of ptarmigan.

36:43.533 --> 36:46.167
And we're gonna
call it a day, and head back,

36:46.200 --> 36:49.133
and clean up these ptarmigan,
and eat some supper.

36:50.867 --> 36:52.967
ERIK: You know,
that's just kinda
how it goes out in the bush.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.200
Sometimes you head out,
try to catch some fish,

36:55.233 --> 36:57.300
and you end up coming home
with some ptarmigan.

36:57.333 --> 36:59.167
Sometimes you head out,
and try to get some ptarmigan

36:59.200 --> 37:00.567
and you come home
with some fish.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.067
You never know
what's going to happen.

37:02.100 --> 37:05.633
It's all fun, it's all food,
it's all just good living.

37:10.567 --> 37:12.467
Open up the chest cavity.

37:13.433 --> 37:15.433
That's where
the good stuff is.

37:15.467 --> 37:17.067
The heart and the gizzard.

37:17.100 --> 37:20.400
The heart, the liver,

37:20.433 --> 37:23.067
and the best of all,
the gizzard.

37:24.433 --> 37:25.933
MARTHA: This is why we live
where we do.

37:25.967 --> 37:28.233
You know, we can go out,
we can go for something

37:28.267 --> 37:30.133
like a lake trout or burbot,

37:30.167 --> 37:31.467
and come back
with something else.

37:31.500 --> 37:35.500
We're pretty happy
and with full bellies.

37:35.533 --> 37:38.367
Despite this being kind
of a poor fishing day,
it turned out all right.

37:38.400 --> 37:40.700
It was awful nice weather,

37:40.733 --> 37:42.233
and we got some ptarmigan
and...

37:42.267 --> 37:44.567
We sure kept ourselves busy
this winter.

37:44.600 --> 37:46.967
MARTHA: Erik and I
went on a fox hunt
this season,

37:47.000 --> 37:49.533
hauled in a nice fox,
a good little red fox.

37:49.567 --> 37:52.067
We had some fun out
in the woods
getting some firewood.

37:52.100 --> 37:55.400
The lynx trapping was
probably one of my favourite
moments this winter.

37:55.433 --> 37:58.000
We were lucky enough
to come home with a nice lynx.

37:58.033 --> 38:01.433
The smoke house build
was definitely something
different.

38:01.467 --> 38:05.067
We were able to scrounge up
some wood and put together
a nice smoke house.

38:05.100 --> 38:07.000
We were able to harvest
three caribou,

38:07.033 --> 38:10.733
which will set us good
on the meat situation
for a while.

38:10.767 --> 38:13.267
As the winters go on,
the seasons change,

38:13.300 --> 38:15.133
things come
a little bit easier.

38:15.167 --> 38:17.567
All in all,
it was a good winter.

38:19.567 --> 38:21.933
I like getting out
and travelling around
this time of year.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.733
It's a good, a good thing.

38:23.767 --> 38:25.933
We're very blessed to live
where we live

38:25.967 --> 38:27.433
and to get to do the things
that we do.

38:31.700 --> 38:33.800
CHIP: It's not
perfect days up here.
Nothing is perfect.

38:33.833 --> 38:36.100
You know, you take every
little trick out of the book
you can do.

38:36.133 --> 38:39.467
This isn't a simple life.
This is a slower life.

38:49.833 --> 38:51.467
AGNES: You want the travel bag
up here or...

38:51.500 --> 38:53.700
Yeah, travel bag
on my machine, please.

38:53.733 --> 38:55.400
CHIP: We got
all the bedding hung up.

38:55.433 --> 38:58.000
We got the tepees
squared away.

38:58.033 --> 38:59.967
We got wood
cut for our return.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.300
We got some ice
already chopped
for our return.

39:02.333 --> 39:05.167
Last night we basically
prepared ourselves entirely

39:05.200 --> 39:06.367
for going home this morning

39:06.400 --> 39:07.433
'cause we wanted
to beat the sun.

39:07.467 --> 39:08.967
We didn't want to have
the sun in our eyes.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
All these cut up caribou
that was skinned,

39:11.033 --> 39:12.667
these can go right
in the cache.

39:12.700 --> 39:13.967
The one that has
the skin on it,

39:14.000 --> 39:15.267
we can save it for a while.

39:15.300 --> 39:17.100
And the animals
can't chew on it at home.

39:17.133 --> 39:18.933
We had the intentions
of going into the mountains

39:18.967 --> 39:21.267
to go caribou hunting
and go set wolverine traps,

39:21.300 --> 39:23.200
but the weather
just won't let us up there.

39:23.233 --> 39:25.533
It's foggy, it's blowing,
can't see a thing to hunt,

39:25.567 --> 39:27.200
so we just did it
all down here low.

39:27.233 --> 39:29.700
And we lucked out
because the caribou came to us
this year.

39:32.100 --> 39:34.167
CHIP: In the end,
this is worth the adventure,
ain't it?

39:34.200 --> 39:35.767
Yep.

39:35.800 --> 39:38.467
Every day we went out there.
We tried our best.

39:41.333 --> 39:44.467
CHIP: Winter started out,
of course,
with some good white fishing.

39:44.500 --> 39:47.900
We had a heck
of a great caribou hunt
to start off our winter with.

39:47.933 --> 39:53.433
I built a cache
to store things in.

39:53.467 --> 39:58.100
Who knows? Maybe the girls
will use it when they're
that age, or when I'm 100.

39:58.133 --> 40:02.000
We built the girls a tepee
and we made them a stove.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.667
We made them a caribou skin
sleeping bag.

40:07.700 --> 40:09.033
And the thing
is that later in life,

40:09.067 --> 40:10.867
they have all the choices
they want.

40:10.900 --> 40:12.767
For now, they should see
what we're doing.

40:12.800 --> 40:14.833
So they don't think we leave
and just magically come back

40:14.867 --> 40:16.067
with a bunch of meat
and stuff.

40:16.100 --> 40:18.000
They also should be part
of the adventure.

40:18.033 --> 40:19.500
They should be part
of the work.

40:19.533 --> 40:20.800
They should be
part of all this,

40:20.833 --> 40:22.133
so that when they
do it themselves,

40:22.167 --> 40:24.800
it'll be easy, natural,
and it won't be a problem.

40:25.767 --> 40:27.600
I want them
to experience this.

40:27.633 --> 40:32.367
And that's pretty
important to me, and my wife,
and part of raising our kids.

40:34.633 --> 40:38.033
SUE: This ecosystem,
this part of the world,

40:38.067 --> 40:41.100
things can happen
in the blink of an eye.

40:42.833 --> 40:45.233
It's controlled chaos
out here.

40:53.433 --> 40:54.600
NARRATOR: For Sue,

40:54.633 --> 40:57.467
surgery on her collarbone
means she must remain in town.

40:58.433 --> 41:00.133
Every day she's away
from Kavik,

41:00.167 --> 41:03.100
her livelihood is at risk.

41:03.133 --> 41:05.700
My next step is just
getting back to my cubby,

41:05.733 --> 41:09.333
having something to eat,
taking my medicine,
and relaxing.

41:09.367 --> 41:11.600
Two weeks, I go see
the doctor again

41:11.633 --> 41:14.733
and they're going to
check the incision,
make sure it's good.

41:17.667 --> 41:20.167
Even though it hurts,

41:20.200 --> 41:22.867
there's not the damage,

41:22.900 --> 41:26.200
random damage being done
by things being
in the wrong place,

41:26.233 --> 41:28.900
or unattached,
or floating around,
and grinding.

41:28.933 --> 41:33.533
So, every move prior was,
it would jostle,
it would move.

41:33.567 --> 41:35.500
The bones would grind.

41:35.533 --> 41:38.067
Um, that part
is taken care of.

41:38.100 --> 41:40.500
That part is one unit again.

41:40.533 --> 41:42.267
But I thrive on the challenge,

41:42.300 --> 41:45.367
I thrive on,
"This is an obstacle, Sue,

41:45.400 --> 41:47.133
"how the hell are you
going to get around it?"

41:47.167 --> 41:50.067
Part of the enjoyment
is the times you get
knocked down,

41:50.100 --> 41:53.033
the times where
you scrape your knees
and you make mistakes.

41:53.067 --> 41:54.533
Because you learn from it.

41:54.567 --> 41:58.700
This has been a whole season
of joys, disappointments,

41:58.733 --> 42:00.633
and looking forward
to learning the next.

42:00.667 --> 42:05.800
You don't know what depths
your strengths go to
if they're never tested.

42:05.833 --> 42:07.200
I'm a bull
in a china shop.

42:07.233 --> 42:09.200
I will get to the other side.

42:09.233 --> 42:10.533
I don't know when.

42:10.567 --> 42:12.633
Life's a circle,
it's not a box.

42:12.667 --> 42:15.400
It's a circular kind of thing,
you just keep going.

42:15.433 --> 42:17.000
I'm making plans
for the future,

42:17.033 --> 42:19.567
I just, you know,
I can't get carried away
with it.

42:19.600 --> 42:22.000
I can't put the cart
before the horse

42:22.033 --> 42:24.333
and worry about what
might happen,

42:24.367 --> 42:27.167
worrying about what
I have to do currently.

42:27.200 --> 42:29.133
And that's just who I am.
