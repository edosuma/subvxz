WEBVTT

00:09.509 --> 00:11.067
Tuvok to Voyager.

00:11.144 --> 00:13.271
Voyager, do you read?

00:14.314 --> 00:16.043
You must lie still.

00:16.116 --> 00:18.607
l-l-l can't feel my legs.

00:21.154 --> 00:23.349
Several of your vertebrae
have been fractured.

00:23.423 --> 00:25.948
lsn't there anything you can do?

00:26.026 --> 00:29.052
l'm afraid the shuttle's
medical supplies are inadequate.

00:29.129 --> 00:31.290
We must wait
for Voyager to find us.

00:32.665 --> 00:34.155
lt's getting worse.

00:34.234 --> 00:35.667
My whole body feels numb.

00:35.735 --> 00:37.396
l want you to slow
your breathing

00:37.470 --> 00:39.438
and relax your muscles.

00:39.506 --> 00:41.371
Try not to move.

00:41.441 --> 00:44.001
A-All this time l thought...

00:44.077 --> 00:45.806
l thought l was so lucky--

00:45.879 --> 00:48.177
no family back home...

00:48.248 --> 00:50.546
nobody to miss.

00:50.617 --> 00:54.883
Now it seems kind of sad not,
not to leave anybody behind.

00:54.954 --> 00:58.253
l believe Ensign Macormak
would miss you a great deal.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.994
You think so?

01:02.028 --> 01:05.623
l was never really sure
how sh... sh...

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:34.561 --> 01:35.493
lt's all right.

01:35.562 --> 01:37.359
Don't be frightened.
l won't hurt you.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.727
Let me go!

01:38.798 --> 01:40.060
Will you run if l do?

01:44.137 --> 01:45.161
No.

01:48.608 --> 01:49.870
My name is Tuvok.

01:49.943 --> 01:50.875
Who are you?

01:50.944 --> 01:52.878
Tressa.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.436
You don't look like us.

01:54.514 --> 01:56.539
l am not a member of your race.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.641
l am Vulcan.

01:58.718 --> 02:01.448
l thought this moon
was uninhabited.

02:01.521 --> 02:02.886
Do you live here?

02:04.290 --> 02:06.053
We came here on a ship,

02:06.126 --> 02:08.424
but it crashed, like yours.

02:08.527 --> 02:10.189
Where are your parents?

02:10.263 --> 02:11.753
Dead.

02:12.932 --> 02:14.797
ls he dead, too?

02:14.868 --> 02:16.836
Yes.

02:16.903 --> 02:18.336
What were you doing to him?

02:18.404 --> 02:20.964
l put a stasis field
around his body to protect it

02:21.040 --> 02:22.769
until l can take it back
to my ship.

02:22.842 --> 02:23.900
Why?

02:23.977 --> 02:26.810
Some cultures,
like Mr. Bennet's,

02:26.880 --> 02:29.474
consider an appropriate burial
to be a sign of respect.

02:29.582 --> 02:32.949
Tressa, is there anyone else
here with you?

02:36.389 --> 02:38.118
lt's all right.

02:43.763 --> 02:46.254
There is no one
looking after you?

02:46.332 --> 02:48.766
Everyone else died
in the crash.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.530
We're alone.

02:55.074 --> 02:57.167
There is no reason to be afraid.

02:57.243 --> 03:00.542
l will take care of you now and
see that you get home safely.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.692
Captain's Log, supplemental.

05:02.769 --> 05:04.236
l've sent out scouting parties

05:04.304 --> 05:08.206
to analyze the mineral deposits
in the moons around Drayan ll.

05:08.274 --> 05:10.538
Meanwhile,
l've arranged a meeting

05:10.610 --> 05:12.874
with the planet's leader.

05:12.945 --> 05:15.140
According to Neelix,
nobody's had direct contact

05:15.214 --> 05:16.545
with the Drayans for decades.

05:16.616 --> 05:17.878
All he's heard are rumors.

05:17.950 --> 05:19.941
Do any of those rumors
describe them as hostile?

05:20.019 --> 05:21.577
No. Just very private.

05:21.654 --> 05:22.916
That's something.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.616
Deck 4.

05:24.691 --> 05:26.386
My diplomacy professor
used to say

05:26.459 --> 05:29.019
the opening 20 minutes
of a first-contact situation

05:29.095 --> 05:30.619
are the most crucial.

05:30.697 --> 05:32.597
l'd feel better
about this particular 20 minutes

05:32.665 --> 05:34.326
if we had some idea
what to expect.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.368
Sometimes, you have
to go in blind.

05:36.436 --> 05:37.528
That's the exciting part.

05:37.603 --> 05:39.264
When l was a Science Officer,

05:39.339 --> 05:41.569
l always envied
the Captain's privilege

05:41.641 --> 05:44.075
of making first contact
with new races.

05:44.143 --> 05:46.373
l envied it so much,

05:46.446 --> 05:48.471
l almost got myself shipped
back to the Academy

05:48.581 --> 05:49.912
for remedial training.

05:49.982 --> 05:52.109
On my first assignment,

05:52.185 --> 05:54.745
we were sent to make contact
with the Tarkannans.

05:54.821 --> 05:56.948
l studied all the information
we had about them

05:57.023 --> 05:58.888
and pestered the Captain
into letting me be part

05:58.958 --> 06:00.118
of the diplomatic team.

06:00.193 --> 06:03.219
When we came face-to-face
with the Tarkannan delegation,

06:03.296 --> 06:06.129
l very proudly made the
traditional gesture for ''hello,''

06:06.199 --> 06:08.497
not realizing that males
and females of their race

06:08.568 --> 06:11.162
use different styles
of movement, and l was

06:11.237 --> 06:13.535
actually propositioning
the ambassador.

06:14.974 --> 06:16.305
Energize.

06:26.085 --> 06:28.110
l'm Captain Kathryn Janeway.

06:28.187 --> 06:31.987
l'd like to welcome you aboard
the Federation Starship Voyager.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.288
First Prelate Alcia.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.328
May this day find you at peace

06:36.396 --> 06:37.954
and leave you with hope.

06:38.030 --> 06:39.088
That's a traditional
blessing

06:39.165 --> 06:40.894
from our ancient scrolls.

06:40.967 --> 06:42.832
Om-nah-hoo-pez-nyeetz.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.563
That's from the spirits
of my people.

06:44.637 --> 06:48.095
lt means, ''peace in your heart,
fortune in your steps.''

06:48.174 --> 06:51.041
lt's very gracious of you
to agree to meet with us.

06:51.110 --> 06:55.137
We don't often engage in
dialogue with alien races,

06:55.214 --> 06:58.183
but your story of crossing
the galaxy intrigued me.

06:58.251 --> 07:01.345
l'd be glad to tell you all
about our journey and my crew.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.584
Perhaps you'd like to see
more of our ship as well.

07:04.657 --> 07:06.215
Thank you.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.364
Our warp core
is designed to operate

07:20.473 --> 07:23.033
for up to three years
before refueling.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.942
The reaction chamber is
equipped with a compositor,

07:26.012 --> 07:28.344
which allows us to recrystallize
the dilithium.

07:28.414 --> 07:30.314
ln our situation,
we can never be sure

07:30.383 --> 07:32.317
when we'll be able
to find a new supply.

07:32.385 --> 07:35.115
l'm sorry my Chief Engineer
isn't here to meet you.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.815
She's leading one
of the away teams

07:36.889 --> 07:38.982
surveying the moons
around Drayan.

07:39.058 --> 07:40.582
l find it interesting

07:40.660 --> 07:43.390
that you chose this
to show me first.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.432
Do your people consider
advanced technology

07:46.499 --> 07:48.228
to be their highest achievement?

07:48.301 --> 07:49.768
Not as an end in itself.

07:49.836 --> 07:51.326
The purpose of all this

07:51.404 --> 07:54.134
is to help us gain knowledge
about the universe

07:54.207 --> 07:55.674
and the people in it.

07:55.741 --> 07:59.268
Our ancestors were brilliant
scientists and engineers.

07:59.345 --> 08:00.710
They were continually developing

08:00.780 --> 08:03.772
better, smarter,
more efficient machines,

08:03.850 --> 08:04.782
until the technology

08:04.851 --> 08:07.319
became more important
than the people.

08:07.386 --> 08:09.479
l believe that society
would have self-destructed

08:09.555 --> 08:11.455
if it weren't
for the Reformation.

08:11.524 --> 08:14.288
My great-grandfather
helped to return us

08:14.360 --> 08:16.658
to ourselves,
and since that time,

08:16.729 --> 08:20.062
we've remained isolated
to avoid the influence

08:20.132 --> 08:22.726
of those who might lead us
back down the wrong path.

08:22.802 --> 08:25.999
Some human cultures
have done the same.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.245
Will your friend be
all right in there?

08:34.313 --> 08:37.578
Yes, l have secured his body
within the stasis field.

08:37.650 --> 08:40.380
You are all very fortunate
to have escaped the crash

08:40.453 --> 08:41.750
with only a few bruises.

08:41.821 --> 08:43.948
The attendants protected us.

08:44.023 --> 08:44.955
Attendants?

08:45.024 --> 08:45.991
The people on our ship--

08:46.058 --> 08:48.026
they got us to the escape pod

08:48.094 --> 08:49.425
before they crashed.

08:49.495 --> 08:50.587
Can we go now?

08:50.663 --> 08:51.994
l want to go.

08:52.064 --> 08:53.725
Are we going to fly
in your ship?

08:53.799 --> 08:56.597
He said it was a shuttle,
not a ship.

08:56.669 --> 08:57.931
We cannot leave yet.

08:58.004 --> 08:59.767
My shuttle
is in need of repairs.

08:59.839 --> 09:01.238
Can't you fix it?

09:01.340 --> 09:02.329
l believe so.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.900
However, l am more concerned
with getting through

09:04.977 --> 09:07.002
the electrodynamic turbulence
in the ionosphere.

09:07.079 --> 09:09.309
What's electro turbulence?

09:09.382 --> 09:11.350
A thermal inversion gradient

09:11.417 --> 09:13.942
is causing unusually strong
and unpredictable currents

09:14.020 --> 09:15.851
in the upper levels
of the atmosphere.

09:15.922 --> 09:18.914
Those currents caused
my shuttle to crash,

09:18.991 --> 09:20.822
and l assume, yours as well.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.623
l must find a way to safely
navigate through the turbulence

09:23.696 --> 09:25.129
before we can attempt to leave.

09:25.197 --> 09:26.755
Will that take a long time?

09:26.832 --> 09:29.323
lt may.
You must be patient.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.097
l don't want
to stay here anymore.

09:31.170 --> 09:33.263
l don't like it here.

09:33.339 --> 09:35.773
Your displeasure doesn't change
our situation,

09:35.841 --> 09:38.071
nor does it bring us
any closer to a solution.

09:38.144 --> 09:40.044
You don't have to be
so mean about it.

09:40.112 --> 09:42.080
lt isn't my intention
to be mean.

09:42.148 --> 09:44.912
l only wish to provide you
with a realistic assessment.

09:44.984 --> 09:48.579
Vulcan parents never shield
their children from the truth.

09:48.654 --> 09:50.781
Doing so would only hinder
their ability to cope

09:50.856 --> 09:52.414
with inevitable difficulties.

09:52.525 --> 09:54.356
l'm hungry.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.419
There is a supply of Starfleet
rations in the shuttle.

09:57.496 --> 09:59.054
What's rations?

09:59.131 --> 10:02.123
Concentrated, vitamin-enriched
nutritional supplements.

10:02.201 --> 10:04.032
l want takka berries.

10:04.103 --> 10:06.264
With cherel sauce.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.500
We have only rations.

10:09.842 --> 10:12.572
Now, l must begin working
on my shuttle.

10:12.645 --> 10:14.044
By my estimate, we have fewer

10:14.113 --> 10:15.671
than four hours
of daylight remaining.

10:15.748 --> 10:17.477
We can't be here
when it's night.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.279
That's when the morrok comes.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.149
ls that a species of animal?

10:21.220 --> 10:23.711
The morrok is what
takes you when you die.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.279
lt lives here...

10:25.358 --> 10:26.916
in the cave.

10:33.366 --> 10:36.699
l'm not detecting any life-forms
other than ourselves.

10:36.769 --> 10:38.236
lt's here.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.204
lt'll come.

10:41.741 --> 10:43.641
Have any of you ever
seen this creature?

10:43.709 --> 10:46.041
You can only see it
when it comes for you.

10:46.112 --> 10:47.670
Then it's too late.

10:47.747 --> 10:50.944
l believe your anxiety
about our situation

10:51.017 --> 10:52.450
is causing you
to imagine the presence...

10:52.518 --> 10:53.450
lt took the others!

10:53.519 --> 10:55.419
Jarren and Fayla--

10:55.488 --> 10:57.115
the other children on the ship.

10:57.189 --> 10:59.657
The morrok took them
while we were sleeping...

10:59.725 --> 11:02.250
and tonight, it will take us.

11:17.943 --> 11:21.106
The Federation consists
of over 150 different worlds

11:21.180 --> 11:23.705
who have agreed to share
their knowledge and resources

11:23.783 --> 11:26.183
in peaceful cooperation.

11:26.252 --> 11:28.220
Ah, visitors.

11:28.287 --> 11:29.652
Welcome to Sick Bay.

11:29.722 --> 11:31.280
l'm the Chief Medical Officer.

11:31.357 --> 11:34.622
This is First Prelate
Alcia of Drayan ll.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.662
lt's an honor to meet you.

11:36.729 --> 11:39.095
We don't often receive
such distinguished guests here,

11:39.165 --> 11:41.565
unless there's been
some sort of accident.

11:44.303 --> 11:46.771
l'm... sure nothing unfortunate
will happen to you

11:46.839 --> 11:49.501
on your visit here, but if
it did, you can rest assured

11:49.642 --> 11:51.906
you will find yourself
in very capable hands.

11:51.977 --> 11:53.842
We are fully equipped to provide

11:53.913 --> 11:55.710
a wide variety
of treatments here,

11:55.781 --> 11:57.749
from removing a splinter

11:57.817 --> 12:01.548
to resequencing the base pairs
in a strand of DNA.

12:01.620 --> 12:04.248
And our research facilities

12:04.323 --> 12:06.757
are the most advanced
in Starfleet.

12:06.826 --> 12:08.418
Very impressive.

12:08.527 --> 12:10.051
You may be even more
interested to learn

12:10.129 --> 12:12.791
that this man isn't really
a biological life-form.

12:12.865 --> 12:16.631
He's a computer-generated
holographic projection.

12:21.674 --> 12:23.335
My people believe

12:23.409 --> 12:26.105
that physical matter's
only an illusion.

12:26.178 --> 12:28.408
The body is not the true self,

12:28.481 --> 12:30.210
only a representation.

12:30.282 --> 12:32.477
One of our greatest
philosophers, Plato,

12:32.551 --> 12:34.382
wrote that what we see around us

12:34.453 --> 12:36.683
are only poor shadows
of ideal objects,

12:36.756 --> 12:38.485
which exist on a higher plane.

12:38.557 --> 12:41.025
That is similar
to our teachings.

12:41.093 --> 12:44.153
Our connection to what you call
a higher plane

12:44.230 --> 12:46.698
is more important
than our attachment

12:46.766 --> 12:49.234
to this brief existence,
however real it may seem.

12:49.301 --> 12:50.325
Bridge to Captain.

12:50.402 --> 12:52.734
There's an incoming message
for the First Prelate.

12:52.805 --> 12:54.898
Perhaps you'd like
to use my office.

12:54.974 --> 12:58.171
Uh, yes.
Thank you, Doctor...?

12:58.244 --> 13:00.235
l'm afraid it's just Doctor.

13:02.481 --> 13:04.210
Patch it through
on a secure channel

13:04.283 --> 13:05.841
to the Doctor's office, Mr. Kim.

13:05.918 --> 13:07.385
Acknowledged.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.385
You did very well.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.546
l think she was impressed.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.090
Kes has been coaching me
on my diplomatic skills.

13:12.158 --> 13:14.092
lt shows.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.390
Our next step will be
to open negotiations--

13:16.462 --> 13:17.724
find out what they
might be interested

13:17.797 --> 13:18.923
in getting from us

13:18.998 --> 13:21.159
in exchange
for the polyferranide.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.428
l've been called away
on an emergency.

13:24.503 --> 13:26.903
ls there anything
we can do to help?

13:26.972 --> 13:27.996
No. Thank you.

13:28.073 --> 13:29.370
lt would be better
if you and your crew

13:29.441 --> 13:30.373
continued on your journey.

13:30.442 --> 13:32.342
lt's been an interesting visit.

13:32.411 --> 13:34.572
We'd been hoping
to learn more about you.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.810
lt's been our custom
for generations

13:37.883 --> 13:40.181
to avoid close contact
with outsiders.

13:40.252 --> 13:42.846
l choose to honor
that tradition.

13:42.922 --> 13:44.651
Good-bye, Captain.

13:44.723 --> 13:46.850
l hope you find your way home.

13:51.297 --> 13:52.730
Was it something l said?

13:52.798 --> 13:54.459
We could assure her
we have no intention

13:54.533 --> 13:56.501
of interfering with their
culture or traditions.

13:56.602 --> 13:58.832
No. She made her wishes clear.

13:58.904 --> 14:00.804
lf we're not welcome, we'll go.

14:00.873 --> 14:02.272
Recall the scouting parties.

14:02.341 --> 14:05.777
We'll have to find our
polyferranide somewhere else.

14:07.079 --> 14:09.104
Where did you last see
the missing children?

14:09.181 --> 14:12.412
By the big tree when we
went to sleep last night.

14:12.484 --> 14:13.781
Were either of them injured?

14:13.853 --> 14:15.343
Jarren hurt his hand.

14:15.421 --> 14:16.854
But both were able to walk?

14:16.922 --> 14:17.854
Uh-huh.

14:17.923 --> 14:19.948
Did any of you hear them
get up during the night?

14:20.025 --> 14:22.585
You think they wandered
off and got lost,

14:22.661 --> 14:23.628
but they didn't.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.254
The morrok took them.

14:25.331 --> 14:26.389
They're gone.

14:26.465 --> 14:27.432
The other children

14:27.499 --> 14:29.091
aren't within scanning range
of this tricorder.

14:29.168 --> 14:31.329
That is the only thing we know
for certain at this time.

14:31.403 --> 14:32.870
You don't understand.

14:32.938 --> 14:34.565
We have to get away from here.

14:34.640 --> 14:35.971
Please, can we go?

14:36.041 --> 14:37.338
l'm scared.

14:37.409 --> 14:38.433
Please, Tuvok?

14:38.510 --> 14:42.105
Children, you are allowing
your fears to guide you.

14:42.181 --> 14:44.206
You must learn
to exercise control

14:44.283 --> 14:45.250
over your own imagination.

14:45.317 --> 14:46.249
But the morrok!

14:46.318 --> 14:47.410
Yes.

14:47.486 --> 14:50.284
The existence of such a creature
is one possibility.

14:50.356 --> 14:53.018
However, your emotional
reactions are preventing you

14:53.092 --> 14:56.061
from accurately judging
how unlikely that is to be true.

14:56.128 --> 14:57.288
l can't help it.

14:57.363 --> 14:58.796
l'm scared.

14:58.864 --> 15:00.388
l believe you can help it.

15:00.466 --> 15:03.367
Vulcan children learn to detach
themselves from their emotions

15:03.435 --> 15:04.800
at an early age.

15:04.870 --> 15:05.962
How?

15:06.038 --> 15:09.940
First, you must focus
on the object of your fear.

15:10.009 --> 15:13.501
Picture the morrok
clearly in your minds.

15:16.015 --> 15:20.008
That image is accompanied
by an emotional response.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.280
Describe for me
what that feeling is like.

15:22.354 --> 15:24.845
lt makes my stomach all tight.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.984
l feel like l want to run,
but my legs won't work.

15:28.060 --> 15:30.426
Now, if you could see this
emotion in physical form,

15:30.496 --> 15:32.054
what would it look like?

15:32.131 --> 15:34.292
lt's like this big black cloud

15:34.366 --> 15:37.358
with lots of thunder
and lightning all around us.

15:37.436 --> 15:40.564
Then imagine a strong wind
is pushing that cloud away.

15:40.639 --> 15:43.802
Watch as your fear
grows more distant.

15:43.876 --> 15:46.674
lt is no longer a part of you.

15:46.745 --> 15:48.110
Once you begin

15:48.180 --> 15:51.081
to detach yourselves
from your emotional responses,

15:51.150 --> 15:53.277
you come closer
to controlling them.

15:53.352 --> 15:55.877
Eventually, they will be
eliminated altogether.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.583
Do you live your whole life
without feeling anything?

15:58.657 --> 16:02.149
More accurately, we strive
to control our feelings.

16:02.227 --> 16:04.457
You don't get scared... ever?

16:04.530 --> 16:05.724
No.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.789
Even when your shuttle crashed?

16:07.866 --> 16:08.958
That is correct.

16:09.034 --> 16:10.365
But what if there was

16:10.436 --> 16:12.267
this big hairy tardeth
coming after you...

16:12.338 --> 16:14.738
The circumstances
are irrelevant.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.275
A Vulcan approaches
every situation logically.

16:17.343 --> 16:19.971
Now, l must begin work
on my shuttle.

16:20.045 --> 16:22.172
We will resume the search
for the other children

16:22.247 --> 16:23.714
once the sensors
are operational.

16:23.782 --> 16:26.307
l expect each of you
to sit quietly

16:26.385 --> 16:28.410
and not touch
any of the equipment.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.545
We promise.

16:33.125 --> 16:36.117
Elani, please, put that down.

16:37.129 --> 16:38.153
Let me have it!

16:38.230 --> 16:39.663
No! l found it!

16:41.266 --> 16:42.790
Be careful with that!

16:45.170 --> 16:46.228
You...

16:46.305 --> 16:48.170
will stay here.

16:49.975 --> 16:52.170
And you...

16:52.244 --> 16:54.178
will stay here.

16:54.246 --> 16:55.679
Where do l get to sit?

16:59.351 --> 17:01.649
But l want to sit next to you.

17:19.271 --> 17:20.602
Tuvok?

17:20.672 --> 17:21.638
Yes?

17:21.707 --> 17:23.834
Why do your ears
look like that?

17:23.909 --> 17:26.377
All Vulcans have
similarly shaped ears.

17:26.444 --> 17:27.742
Why?

17:27.813 --> 17:30.304
lt is a result
of many millennia of evolution.

17:30.382 --> 17:31.872
Do they make you hear better?

17:31.950 --> 17:33.850
No.

17:33.919 --> 17:35.216
Where do Vulcans live?

17:35.287 --> 17:36.618
ls it far away?

17:36.688 --> 17:40.647
My homeworld is on the
other side of the galaxy.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.284
Elani. Elani!

17:42.361 --> 17:44.522
l asked you not
to play with that.

17:44.596 --> 17:45.563
Sorry.

17:50.102 --> 17:51.899
What are you doing?

17:51.970 --> 17:54.962
lt helps prepare you to
attain a meditative state.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.564
Now close your eyes

17:56.642 --> 17:59.110
and imagine
all the energy in your body

17:59.178 --> 18:02.341
is flowing to the point
where your fingertips meet.

18:03.816 --> 18:07.252
Nothing else you hear
or feel is important.

18:08.887 --> 18:11.720
Let the outside world fade away.

18:11.790 --> 18:14.486
You exist only inside your mind.

18:16.895 --> 18:18.157
Tuvok?

18:18.230 --> 18:19.288
Yes?

18:19.364 --> 18:21.059
Do you have any children?

18:21.133 --> 18:22.327
Be quiet.

18:22.401 --> 18:25.700
We are trying to attain
a meditative state.

18:25.771 --> 18:26.931
But l want to know.

18:27.005 --> 18:28.597
l have four children.

18:28.674 --> 18:30.437
Now, you must concentrate.

18:32.144 --> 18:33.611
What are they like?

18:33.679 --> 18:35.670
Well-behaved.

18:35.747 --> 18:37.578
They had already mastered

18:37.649 --> 18:39.241
several states of
heightened awareness

18:39.318 --> 18:40.876
by the time they were your age.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.114
lf Vulcans don't feel anything,

18:43.188 --> 18:44.849
does that mean
you don't love them?

18:46.625 --> 18:48.320
My attachment to my children

18:48.393 --> 18:50.384
cannot be described
as an emotion.

18:50.462 --> 18:53.363
They are part of my identity.

18:53.432 --> 18:55.730
And l am...

18:55.801 --> 18:58.429
incomplete without them.

18:58.504 --> 19:01.701
l bet they miss you, too.

19:02.774 --> 19:04.105
Tuvok?

19:04.176 --> 19:05.268
Yes?

19:05.344 --> 19:07.574
l have to scratch my nose.

19:07.646 --> 19:09.011
You may.

19:09.081 --> 19:11.345
Tuvok!

19:11.416 --> 19:12.542
Yes!

19:12.618 --> 19:14.210
l hear something.

19:14.286 --> 19:15.947
ls it a ship?

19:16.021 --> 19:17.386
l believe so.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.356
Can you see who it is?

19:24.429 --> 19:26.727
The sensors are
only partially functional.

19:26.798 --> 19:28.356
l'm attempting
to identify the ship

19:28.467 --> 19:30.059
by its shield harmonics.

19:30.135 --> 19:32.103
ls somebody coming to save us?

19:32.171 --> 19:34.264
lt is not a shuttle
from Voyager.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.773
The pattern of the harmonics
matches that of the ships

19:36.842 --> 19:38.969
we scanned in orbit
around Drayan.

19:39.044 --> 19:41.842
lt seems your people
have come looking for you.

19:42.981 --> 19:45.006
We have to hide, Tuvok.

19:45.083 --> 19:46.744
You can't let them find us here.

19:46.818 --> 19:48.183
l don't understand.

19:48.253 --> 19:50.585
l thought you wanted to go home.

19:50.656 --> 19:52.021
They won't take us home.

19:52.090 --> 19:54.183
They're the ones
who made us come here.

19:54.259 --> 19:55.988
For what purpose?

19:56.061 --> 19:58.825
They sent us here to die.

20:05.604 --> 20:07.071
We have to go.

20:07.139 --> 20:09.004
lf they find us, we'll all die.

20:09.074 --> 20:10.234
Please, Tuvok.

20:10.309 --> 20:12.834
Why would your own people
want to harm you?

20:12.911 --> 20:14.378
Please.
They're coming.

20:14.446 --> 20:16.209
Help us.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.588
Any indication
where they've gone?

20:33.665 --> 20:34.654
No.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.064
Spread out and scan the area.

20:39.204 --> 20:41.035
Two of them are coming this way.

20:42.274 --> 20:43.639
What are you doing?

20:43.709 --> 20:45.574
This will hide us
from their scanners.

21:08.834 --> 21:10.802
l'm not picking up
any life-forms this way.

21:29.855 --> 21:31.755
Why do you believe
they've come to kill you?

21:31.823 --> 21:33.222
We're supposed to die here.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.157
That's what this place is for.

21:35.227 --> 21:37.991
They bring children here
for the final ritual.

21:38.063 --> 21:40.395
Then the morrok takes them away.

21:40.465 --> 21:41.864
No one ever comes back.

21:41.933 --> 21:45.460
lt is illogical for a society
to kill its own children.

21:45.537 --> 21:48.028
The scrolls say
we should be happy--

21:48.106 --> 21:51.507
that when we die, the energy
inside us is set free.

21:51.576 --> 21:52.975
ls it true?

21:53.045 --> 21:55.036
ls that what really happens?

21:55.113 --> 21:58.879
Vulcans believe
that a person's katra--

21:58.950 --> 22:00.884
what some might call a soul--

22:00.986 --> 22:03.853
continues to exist
after the body dies.

22:03.889 --> 22:05.447
Do you believe that?

22:06.458 --> 22:09.689
When l was younger,
l accepted it without question.

22:09.761 --> 22:13.288
ln recent years, l have
experienced doubts.

22:13.365 --> 22:16.129
l do believe there is
more within each of us

22:16.201 --> 22:18.362
than science has yet explained.

22:18.437 --> 22:20.871
l know
we should have more faith.

22:20.939 --> 22:22.839
lt's wrong
to be afraid of death.

22:22.908 --> 22:25.843
There is nothing wrong
in choosing to live.

22:25.911 --> 22:27.742
Will you help us?

22:27.813 --> 22:29.440
Until l can gain
a better understanding

22:29.514 --> 22:32.210
of your situation,
l believe it would be best

22:32.284 --> 22:34.445
to get you safely
back to Voyager.

22:42.127 --> 22:44.027
Torres and Neelix just got back,

22:44.096 --> 22:46.326
but there's still no word
from Tuvok and Bennet.

22:46.398 --> 22:49.162
l'm not picking up
their shuttle on sensors.

22:49.234 --> 22:50.633
There's heavy
solar flare activity.

22:50.702 --> 22:52.499
lt's causing
electrodynamic disturbance

22:52.637 --> 22:53.763
throughout the system.

22:54.906 --> 22:57.704
We found a vein
of pure polyferranide

22:57.776 --> 22:58.834
three kilometers long.

22:58.910 --> 22:59.877
lt's a real shame we're leaving.

22:59.945 --> 23:01.845
When was your last contact
with the other team?

23:01.947 --> 23:04.006
Several hours ago.
ls there a problem?

23:04.049 --> 23:05.516
We can't reach them.

23:05.584 --> 23:06.608
When we spoke to them,

23:06.685 --> 23:08.619
they were going to check out
the outermost moons.

23:08.687 --> 23:11.417
Can you find
the shuttle's ion signature?

23:11.523 --> 23:14.981
l'm reading one
on heading 151 mark 8.

23:15.060 --> 23:17.654
That's where Neelix and l went.

23:17.729 --> 23:19.128
And another one
on a divergent course,

23:19.197 --> 23:20.824
20 degrees to starboard.

23:20.899 --> 23:23.129
Set a course, Mr. Paris.

23:30.208 --> 23:32.073
Our scans of the moon
are inconclusive.

23:32.144 --> 23:33.076
We can't see anything

23:33.145 --> 23:34.578
through the turbulence
in the atmosphere.

23:34.646 --> 23:37.171
The Drayan ship still hasn't
responded to our hails.

23:37.249 --> 23:39.149
Are you sure our signal's
getting through?

23:39.217 --> 23:40.844
They're receiving it.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.147
They're just not answering.

23:42.220 --> 23:43.346
Continue hails.

23:43.422 --> 23:46.050
This desecration
dishonors us both, Captain.

23:46.124 --> 23:47.250
l'm sorry.
l don't understand...

23:47.325 --> 23:50.055
This moon is our crysata...
sacred ground.

23:50.128 --> 23:52.187
Your presence is forbidden here.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.494
We've only come here
to look for one of our shuttles.

23:54.599 --> 23:56.328
lt's missing.

23:56.401 --> 23:58.062
We found your shuttle
on the surface.

23:58.136 --> 23:59.103
The pilot is dead.

23:59.171 --> 24:01.036
There were two men on board.

24:01.139 --> 24:02.606
Did you find both of them?

24:02.641 --> 24:03.938
No, only one.

24:04.009 --> 24:05.670
lf there's someone else
on this moon,

24:05.744 --> 24:08.076
you must transport him back
to your ship immediately.

24:08.146 --> 24:09.773
That's what we intend to do.

24:09.848 --> 24:10.872
This kind of disturbance

24:10.949 --> 24:13.884
is exactly why we avoid contact
with outsiders.

24:13.952 --> 24:15.886
l was wrong to respond
to your communication.

24:15.954 --> 24:18.422
l should have known better
than to indulge my curiosity.

24:18.490 --> 24:19.718
There's no one at fault here.

24:19.791 --> 24:21.383
The shuttle crash
was an accident.

24:21.460 --> 24:24.429
One which l expect you
to correct as soon as possible.

24:26.665 --> 24:27.962
What's the status
of the transporters?

24:28.033 --> 24:29.091
The targeting scanners

24:29.167 --> 24:30.794
still can't lock on to anything
on the surface.

24:30.869 --> 24:32.996
lt would be easier
if we sent down another shuttle.

24:33.071 --> 24:35.335
No, that would only
make things worse.

24:36.408 --> 24:37.739
l'll keep working on it.

24:52.591 --> 24:54.422
l don't see how you
could be thirsty again

24:54.493 --> 24:56.051
after four drinks of water.

24:56.127 --> 24:57.856
Aren't you going to sleep?

24:57.929 --> 25:00.397
l can go several days
without rest if necessary.

25:00.465 --> 25:02.592
You cannot.

25:02.667 --> 25:04.999
lt's warmer by the fire.

25:05.070 --> 25:08.039
Go back and try to sleep.

25:08.106 --> 25:10.131
Do not worry.

25:10.208 --> 25:12.733
l have run several
thorough scans of the area.

25:12.811 --> 25:14.870
There are no other
life-forms present--

25:14.946 --> 25:15.878
inside the cave

25:15.947 --> 25:18.108
or anywhere
within five kilometers.

25:18.183 --> 25:21.414
Maybe the morrok doesn't
show up on the scans.

25:21.486 --> 25:24.011
l am also keeping watch
on all of you from here.

25:24.089 --> 25:25.556
lf there is any
indication of trouble,

25:25.624 --> 25:27.353
l'll come immediately.

25:27.425 --> 25:28.653
Okay.

25:46.845 --> 25:48.813
We can't sleep.

25:50.749 --> 25:52.307
Apparently not.

25:52.384 --> 25:53.681
lt's so dark.

25:53.752 --> 25:55.617
l think the fire's going out.

25:55.687 --> 25:57.780
Maybe you should look.

25:57.856 --> 26:00.416
l added more wood
less than a half an hour ago.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.961
However, it might be wise
to check it again.

26:06.831 --> 26:09.595
l always have my hair brushed
before l go to sleep.

26:09.668 --> 26:11.693
l like to hear a story.

26:11.770 --> 26:14.364
Tell us one
about the fire beast of Sullus.

26:14.439 --> 26:16.339
l never understood
the practice in some cultures

26:16.408 --> 26:18.342
of describing
ferocious creatures

26:18.410 --> 26:20.378
in an attempt
to lull children to sleep.

26:20.512 --> 26:22.707
Don't Vulcans tell
bedtime stories?

26:22.781 --> 26:25.716
lf my children
had difficulty sleeping,

26:25.784 --> 26:27.411
l would play music for them.

26:27.485 --> 26:29.817
l like music.

26:29.888 --> 26:32.356
Unfortunately,
l don't have my lute.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.686
What's that?

26:33.758 --> 26:35.316
lt is a five-stringed
instrument

26:35.393 --> 26:37.520
tuned on a diatonic scale.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.928
lt can be very soothing.

26:39.998 --> 26:43.024
My youngest son was
particularly fond of it.

26:44.135 --> 26:48.231
He always used to ask me
to play ''Falor's Journey.''

26:48.306 --> 26:52.970
lt is a tale of enlightenment
consisting of 348 verses.

26:57.482 --> 27:00.815
lt may not be necessary to
include the complete narrative.

27:00.885 --> 27:03.149
Falor was a prosperous merchant

27:03.221 --> 27:06.190
who went on a journey
to gain greater awareness.

27:06.257 --> 27:10.591
''Through storms,
he crossed the Voroth Sea

27:10.662 --> 27:15.065
''to reach the clouded
shores of Raal,

27:15.133 --> 27:17.499
where old T'Para offered truth.''

27:18.937 --> 27:23.499
He traveled
through the windswept hills

27:23.575 --> 27:28.376
And crossed
the barren Fire Plains

27:28.446 --> 27:34.248
To find the silent monks
of Kir

27:34.319 --> 27:37.049
Still unfulfilled

27:37.122 --> 27:39.647
He journeyed home

27:39.724 --> 27:45.094
Told stories
of the lessons learned

27:45.163 --> 27:53.730
And gained true wisdom
by the giving...

28:26.671 --> 28:29.333
Tuvok! Tuvok!

28:31.676 --> 28:32.870
They're gone.

28:46.791 --> 28:48.622
Captain, you might want
to see this.

28:48.693 --> 28:50.126
Have you found the shuttle?

28:50.195 --> 28:52.288
Actually, we've found two.

28:52.363 --> 28:53.887
Both crashed on the surface.

28:53.965 --> 28:56.331
The sensor resolution
is still quite low.

28:56.401 --> 28:57.834
This looks like our shuttle.

28:57.902 --> 29:00.097
l'd guess the other one
is Drayan.

29:00.171 --> 29:02.833
We've also had some indications
of life signs on the surface.

29:02.907 --> 29:05.000
A while ago, there seemed
to be four of them.

29:05.076 --> 29:07.544
Now we can only distinguish two.

29:07.612 --> 29:10.206
l've been working
on the transporters.

29:10.281 --> 29:12.749
lt just isn't possible
to get a pattern lock

29:12.817 --> 29:13.909
through all the turbulence.

29:13.985 --> 29:16.453
Then we've got to start
considering other options.

29:16.521 --> 29:19.046
l want a full analysis
of the atmospheric conditions

29:19.124 --> 29:21.922
and your best suggestion of how
to get a shuttle to the surface.

29:21.993 --> 29:23.984
Then let's hope
we won't need to try it.

29:28.166 --> 29:29.929
There were no other life-forms

29:30.001 --> 29:32.970
and no unusual energy readings
within sensor range all night.

29:33.037 --> 29:34.163
lt was the morrok.

29:34.239 --> 29:35.968
Why don't you believe me?

29:36.040 --> 29:38.873
Very well.

29:38.943 --> 29:40.877
l'll investigate.

29:40.945 --> 29:44.176
l'd like you to wait here
while l look inside the cave.

29:44.249 --> 29:47.741
But if you go in there,
you won't come out.

29:47.819 --> 29:50.049
l will take
every possible precaution.

29:53.124 --> 29:56.287
l believe you can be responsible
with this.

29:56.361 --> 29:58.352
Aim like this

29:58.429 --> 30:00.397
and press here to fire.

30:00.465 --> 30:02.956
l'll seal the shuttle's
door while l'm gone.

30:03.034 --> 30:07.095
No, Tuvok. Don't leave me
all by myself. Please!

30:07.172 --> 30:08.935
lf there is anything
in the cave,

30:09.007 --> 30:11.908
it may help us determine
what has been happening here.

30:11.976 --> 30:15.810
lt is very important to gather
as much information as possible.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.905
l'm scared.

30:17.982 --> 30:21.440
We often fear
what we do not understand.

30:21.519 --> 30:24.044
Our best defense is knowledge.

30:24.122 --> 30:25.919
You must trust me, Tressa.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.480
l'll return shortly.

30:27.559 --> 30:29.220
Promise?

30:29.294 --> 30:31.057
l will not abandon you.

32:23.107 --> 32:25.405
What did you see in there?

32:25.476 --> 32:30.846
l realize it may frighten you,
but you must hear the truth.

32:33.685 --> 32:36.279
Suffice it to say, l did not
find the other children,

32:36.354 --> 32:40.051
nor do l have any explanation
of what happened to them.

32:40.124 --> 32:42.490
l'm going to be next, aren't l?

32:42.593 --> 32:43.992
There's nothing
we can do about it.

32:44.062 --> 32:47.623
The disappearances have
occurred only at night.

32:47.699 --> 32:50.759
We will attempt to leave
here before the sun sets.

32:50.835 --> 32:53.030
l'll really be quiet this time.

32:53.104 --> 32:54.503
l won't touch anything.

32:54.639 --> 32:56.800
That would make it
difficult for you

32:56.874 --> 32:58.501
to assist me with repairs.

33:00.211 --> 33:01.906
The Drayans have just
sent another shuttle

33:01.980 --> 33:02.969
down to the moon, Captain.

33:03.047 --> 33:06.073
There must be at least 20
people on the surface.

33:06.150 --> 33:07.640
l can't tell
if the two life-forms

33:07.719 --> 33:09.277
we detected before
are still there.

33:09.354 --> 33:11.254
How many search parties
could it take

33:11.322 --> 33:12.687
to find two crash victims?

33:12.757 --> 33:14.190
Captain, there's a break
in the turbulence.

33:14.258 --> 33:15.623
l'm picking up a com signal.

33:15.693 --> 33:18.594
Tuvok to Voyager.
Voyager, do you read?

33:18.663 --> 33:20.528
We read you, Tuvok.
Are you all right?

33:20.598 --> 33:23.032
Yes, Captain,
but Ensign Bennet is dead.

33:23.101 --> 33:24.033
We know.

33:24.102 --> 33:25.660
We've been trying to get you
off the surface,

33:25.737 --> 33:27.398
but we're having some trouble
with the Drayans.

33:27.472 --> 33:29.303
They insist on sending
their own search parties.

33:29.374 --> 33:31.706
Yes, l have been avoiding them.

33:31.776 --> 33:32.708
Why?

33:32.777 --> 33:33.801
l have a young girl with me

33:33.878 --> 33:35.778
who claims
they have come to kill her.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.940
l was reluctant
to believe it at first,

33:38.016 --> 33:40.610
but several other children
have disappeared.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.386
There's nothing l can do,
Captain.

33:44.455 --> 33:45.422
The signal's breaking up.

33:45.490 --> 33:48.084
Tuvok, what happened
to the other children?

33:48.159 --> 33:49.490
They have disappeared.

33:49.594 --> 33:52.062
Something on this moon
is responsible.

33:52.130 --> 33:53.290
We must leave here.

33:53.364 --> 33:55.025
l'm attempting to repair...

33:56.801 --> 33:58.234
Scan Tuvok's shuttle for damage.

33:58.302 --> 34:00.202
Will he be able to get himself
out of there?

34:00.304 --> 34:01.566
There's no structural damage.

34:01.606 --> 34:03.198
Some power fluctuations.

34:03.274 --> 34:05.139
He should be able to take off.

34:05.209 --> 34:06.574
What if they can't?

34:07.912 --> 34:09.708
Hail the Drayan ship.

34:09.781 --> 34:12.375
Captain.

34:12.449 --> 34:15.043
First Prelate,
it's come to my attention

34:15.119 --> 34:17.178
that you have a damaged ship
on the surface as well

34:17.255 --> 34:18.916
and there may be survivors.

34:18.989 --> 34:21.083
l'd like to offer our help
in finding them.

34:21.159 --> 34:22.319
Perhaps a joint
rescue operation...

34:22.393 --> 34:24.327
That won't be necessary,
Captain.

34:24.395 --> 34:25.760
You've been intrusive enough.

34:25.830 --> 34:27.353
Our sensor readings indicate

34:27.431 --> 34:29.297
the people on the surface
may be in trouble.

34:29.367 --> 34:30.425
l'm sure you must be

34:30.501 --> 34:32.764
as concerned
for their safety as we are.

34:32.837 --> 34:35.806
There's no reason to fear for
anyone's safety on the crysata.

34:35.873 --> 34:38.433
lt's a blessed haven,
sheltered and unspoiled,

34:38.543 --> 34:40.534
which is the very reason
why l can't allow you

34:40.610 --> 34:43.045
to go there
under any circumstances.

34:43.114 --> 34:45.742
Then l regret to inform you
l'll be taking a shuttle

34:45.817 --> 34:48.114
to the surface
without your permission.

34:48.186 --> 34:49.483
That's completely unacceptable.

34:49.554 --> 34:51.248
l believe it's necessary.

34:51.322 --> 34:53.255
lf you launch
one of your shuttles,

34:53.324 --> 34:55.121
l will be forced to send
one of ours after you.

34:55.193 --> 34:58.594
First Prelate, it's not my
intention to provoke a conflict.

34:58.663 --> 34:59.891
Well, then leave at once.

34:59.964 --> 35:02.125
l'll be glad to, as soon
as every member of my crew

35:02.233 --> 35:04.258
is safely back on board
this ship.

35:04.302 --> 35:05.769
Janeway out.

35:06.804 --> 35:07.930
Lieutenant, you're with me.

35:09.273 --> 35:11.138
Mr. Kim, l need your report.

35:11.209 --> 35:13.074
l've been studying
the energy signature

35:13.144 --> 35:14.236
of the Drayan shuttles.

35:14.312 --> 35:16.303
They're using some kind
of dielectric field

35:16.380 --> 35:18.075
to protect them
from the turbulence.

35:18.149 --> 35:19.707
We could generate
the same kind of field

35:19.784 --> 35:21.183
with our shuttle's warp coils.

35:21.252 --> 35:22.583
lt won't be very stable.

35:22.653 --> 35:24.848
lt might be a rough ride,
but we can make it.

35:24.922 --> 35:26.822
Captain, maybe you shouldn't...

35:26.891 --> 35:28.756
l know the risks, Commander,
but if there's any hope

35:28.826 --> 35:30.691
left for a diplomatic solution,

35:30.761 --> 35:32.626
l've got to be down there
to see it through.

35:43.341 --> 35:45.832
Let's get through
the preflight quickly.

35:45.910 --> 35:50.142
Thrusters, impulse
engines, warp drive...

35:50.214 --> 35:52.444
All propulsion systems
are nominal.

35:52.517 --> 35:56.817
Shields, phasers, inertial
dampers, com system.

35:56.888 --> 35:58.116
l think we've got
all the basics.

35:58.189 --> 36:00.817
Computer, initiate
cold launch sequence.

36:00.925 --> 36:03.621
Or we could just skip
preflight altogether.

36:03.661 --> 36:05.856
Definitely not recommended,
but sometimes necessary.

36:05.930 --> 36:06.897
l'll remember that.

36:06.964 --> 36:09.956
l'm taking the warp drive
off-line.

36:10.034 --> 36:12.366
Setting up the dielectric field.

36:12.470 --> 36:14.665
lt's holding, but we'll
have to keep an eye

36:14.739 --> 36:16.502
on the stabilizer integrity.

36:16.574 --> 36:17.632
Janeway to Bridge.

36:17.708 --> 36:20.176
Depressurize the shuttle bay
and open the space doors.

36:20.244 --> 36:21.404
Aye, Captain.

36:28.686 --> 36:30.244
Captain, l'm picking up
a Drayan shuttle.

36:30.321 --> 36:32.118
They're on an intercept course.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.157
Can we outrun them?

36:37.762 --> 36:38.854
The dielectric field

36:38.930 --> 36:40.955
is weakening our
structural integrity.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.091
lf we go much faster,
l'm afraid we'll break up.

36:43.167 --> 36:44.862
We're improvising here.

36:44.936 --> 36:45.960
The Drayans aren't.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.561
We're on their home turf.

36:47.638 --> 36:48.969
They have every advantage.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.770
That may be reason enough
for them not to fire on us.

36:51.842 --> 36:54.709
We'll be testing that theory
in a few seconds.

36:54.779 --> 36:56.804
They're about to enter
weapons range, Captain.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.007
Raise shields to maximum

36:58.082 --> 37:00.744
and stand ready
to power the weapons.

37:07.158 --> 37:08.250
Maneuvering thrusters

37:08.326 --> 37:10.157
and impulse engines
are functional.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.889
We're ready to lift off.

37:11.963 --> 37:13.828
What about the electro...?

37:13.898 --> 37:16.128
The currents
that made the ships crash?

37:16.200 --> 37:17.827
l have determined
that a dielectric field

37:17.902 --> 37:19.665
should allow us
to pass through them.

37:19.737 --> 37:22.331
However, you should still be
prepared for some turbulence.

37:23.574 --> 37:25.542
lnitiating prelaunch sequence.

37:26.577 --> 37:28.101
Number three thruster
is failing.

37:28.179 --> 37:29.339
Attempting to stabilize.

37:33.417 --> 37:35.783
Drayan shuttle's closing fast,
Captain.

37:35.853 --> 37:37.582
They'll overtake us
before we can land.

37:37.655 --> 37:39.623
They haven't powered
their weapon systems.

37:39.690 --> 37:41.180
Maybe they're
still willing to talk.

37:41.259 --> 37:44.194
Let's hope the ones on the
surface feel the same way.

37:45.663 --> 37:48.154
We'll be through this ionosphere
in a few more minutes.

37:48.232 --> 37:49.699
Sensors are clearing up.

37:49.767 --> 37:52.201
l'm reading Tuvok's shuttle.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.170
He's trying to lift off,
but it looks

37:54.238 --> 37:55.762
like there's some trouble
with the thrusters.

37:56.974 --> 37:58.669
And there's
a large Drayan search party

37:58.743 --> 38:00.370
approaching his location.

38:01.946 --> 38:03.413
l see them.

38:03.481 --> 38:05.346
They're coming all around us.

38:05.416 --> 38:07.247
We've got to go-- now.

38:07.318 --> 38:08.717
l'm attempting
an emergency procedure.

38:08.786 --> 38:10.413
Please move away
from the console.

38:26.170 --> 38:27.831
You did it!

38:27.905 --> 38:29.600
You saved me.

38:29.674 --> 38:31.869
l regret that may be
a premature conclusion.

38:31.942 --> 38:33.603
The process
of powering the thrusters

38:33.678 --> 38:36.408
has left us with minimal shields
and no functional weapons.

38:36.514 --> 38:38.914
Voyager will be
watching for us.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.109
When we clear the atmosphere,

38:40.184 --> 38:41.674
we can be transported
aboard the ship.

38:41.752 --> 38:43.413
Then what are we going to do?

38:43.487 --> 38:45.785
You may request asylum
with the Federation if you wish.

38:45.856 --> 38:47.756
Then we'll be able
to protect you.

38:47.825 --> 38:49.656
l want to stay with you.

38:51.062 --> 38:53.155
The Drayan shuttle
is hailing us.

38:53.230 --> 38:54.993
You're holding
one of our children.

38:55.066 --> 38:56.328
l want to speak to her.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.265
She believes
you intend to kill her.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.428
ls that true?

38:59.537 --> 39:01.198
The child is confused.

39:01.305 --> 39:02.932
l only want to help her.

39:02.973 --> 39:04.634
You want me to die.

39:04.709 --> 39:07.974
Tressa, l understand how
confusing this must be for you.

39:08.045 --> 39:09.069
lf you return to the surface,

39:09.146 --> 39:10.545
l will answer
all of your questions.

39:10.614 --> 39:12.912
No. l'm not going back there.

39:12.983 --> 39:15.178
l'm staying with Tuvok.

39:15.252 --> 39:17.743
We can resolve this matter
aboard Voyager.

39:17.822 --> 39:19.153
Unacceptable.

39:19.223 --> 39:20.247
lf you or any of your people

39:20.324 --> 39:21.848
attempt to take Tressa
back to your ship,

39:21.926 --> 39:24.292
l will use any means necessary
to stop you.

39:24.362 --> 39:25.920
Do what you will.

39:27.164 --> 39:29.564
Very well.

39:29.633 --> 39:30.895
Fire.

39:36.674 --> 39:37.936
We weren't hit.

39:38.008 --> 39:39.805
l believe that was a warning.

39:42.213 --> 39:44.579
l've got phasers locked on
the Drayan shuttle, Captain.

39:44.648 --> 39:45.615
Don't fire.

39:45.683 --> 39:47.981
We might be able
to transport Tuvok from here.

39:49.186 --> 39:51.154
There's still
too much interference.

39:51.222 --> 39:54.089
We should be close enough
to get a com-signal through.

39:54.158 --> 39:56.592
Tuvok, we're on our way
to the surface.

39:56.660 --> 39:58.184
We'll intercept you
in a few moments.

39:58.262 --> 39:59.695
That may be too late, Captain.

39:59.764 --> 40:01.459
l'm losing power rapidly.

40:02.933 --> 40:05.231
l believe another hit
will force me to land.

40:05.302 --> 40:06.394
Go back down to the surface.

40:06.470 --> 40:07.437
We'll follow you.

40:12.576 --> 40:14.100
lt's getting dark.

40:14.178 --> 40:15.839
What's going to happen to me?

40:15.913 --> 40:18.848
All l can tell you is,
l will be here with you.

40:23.888 --> 40:25.856
Mr. Tuvok, don't
make this difficult.

40:25.923 --> 40:27.914
She's been frightened enough.

40:27.992 --> 40:29.050
What she fears most

40:29.126 --> 40:31.094
is being kept here
against her wishes.

40:31.162 --> 40:32.595
This is a critical time.

40:32.663 --> 40:34.597
l can't allow you to interfere.

40:39.136 --> 40:40.797
l regret it's come to this.

40:40.871 --> 40:43.032
You have found your crew member.

40:43.107 --> 40:44.074
Now go.

40:44.141 --> 40:45.608
l will not leave without Tressa.

40:45.676 --> 40:48.543
She has asked for my protection,
and l intend to provide it.

40:48.612 --> 40:51.775
You simply don't understand
the harm you're doing.

40:51.849 --> 40:53.077
This child wants to live.

40:53.150 --> 40:55.675
We're going to do
whatever we can to help her.

40:55.753 --> 40:57.220
lt is not a choice.

40:57.288 --> 40:59.313
This is her time.

40:59.390 --> 41:01.358
Tressa has reached
the end of her life.

41:01.459 --> 41:02.858
She has barely begun it.

41:02.893 --> 41:05.623
She is 96 years old.

41:08.332 --> 41:10.766
Tressa, these people
are outsiders.

41:10.835 --> 41:13.360
They don't understand
how we live.

41:13.437 --> 41:16.600
They see us as strange because
their aging process is reversed.

41:16.674 --> 41:19.006
Please, you don't belong
with them.

41:19.076 --> 41:20.737
l'm here to help you now.

41:20.811 --> 41:23.041
No. Leave me alone.

41:23.113 --> 41:26.048
lt's perfectly natural
to be frightened.

41:26.116 --> 41:28.482
You're taking a step
into the unknown.

41:28.552 --> 41:30.816
The attendants would have
helped you prepare yourself.

41:30.888 --> 41:32.753
You were never meant to face
this time alone.

41:32.823 --> 41:34.347
We weren't alone.

41:34.425 --> 41:35.790
Tuvok was here.

41:35.860 --> 41:38.454
He stayed with us
and made us feel safe.

41:38.529 --> 41:40.724
He told us there was no morrok

41:40.798 --> 41:42.356
and that we shouldn't be afraid.

41:42.433 --> 41:44.367
He took care of us...

41:44.435 --> 41:49.338
even when we didn't behave
as well as Vulcan children.

41:49.406 --> 41:51.033
He was right about the morrok.

41:51.108 --> 41:54.077
lt only exists in stories.

41:54.144 --> 41:57.341
At this age,
they become easily confused.

41:57.414 --> 41:58.881
Their memories are clouded.

41:58.949 --> 42:02.715
Near the end of life, we reach
a stage of complete innocence.

42:02.820 --> 42:05.948
We free ourselves from all
responsibilities to this life,

42:05.990 --> 42:07.548
then we leave it peacefully.

42:07.625 --> 42:09.422
Tressa doesn't seem to be ready.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.358
Perhaps she needs more time.

42:11.428 --> 42:13.919
That's not for you or me
to decide.

42:13.998 --> 42:16.057
This is
a normal biological process,

42:16.133 --> 42:18.192
which begins
the day we are created.

42:18.269 --> 42:20.533
The energy contained
within our bodies

42:20.604 --> 42:23.004
remains cohesive
for a limited number of years,

42:23.073 --> 42:24.335
and then it is released.

42:24.408 --> 42:26.433
Nothing can change that.

42:26.510 --> 42:28.273
Nothing?

42:28.345 --> 42:29.676
No.

42:29.747 --> 42:32.147
lt's the natural course of life.

42:32.216 --> 42:33.979
Why was it so important
that Tressa stay here?

42:34.051 --> 42:35.313
We believe

42:35.386 --> 42:38.287
this is where the very first
spark of life was created.

42:38.355 --> 42:39.413
We are all compelled

42:39.490 --> 42:42.618
by a powerful instinct
to return here at the end,

42:42.693 --> 42:46.129
to complete the cycle
and rejoin the infinite energy.

42:46.196 --> 42:47.629
Tressa?

42:47.698 --> 42:49.131
Do you feel it calling to you?

42:49.199 --> 42:50.791
Tuvok?

42:53.671 --> 42:56.139
She can offer you
better guidance than l.

42:56.206 --> 42:58.174
You said you would protect me.

42:58.242 --> 42:59.231
l cannot protect you

42:59.310 --> 43:01.369
from the natural
conclusion of life,

43:01.478 --> 43:03.878
nor would l try.

43:03.914 --> 43:06.007
Vulcans consider death

43:06.083 --> 43:08.643
to be the completion
of a journey.

43:08.719 --> 43:11.119
There is nothing to fear.

43:11.188 --> 43:15.420
l won't be afraid,
not if you're with me.

43:16.894 --> 43:22.799
Tressa, may this night
see you safely home.

43:22.866 --> 43:27.269
Attending a child on the crysata
is an honorable role.

43:27.338 --> 43:29.670
You have fulfilled it well.

43:32.242 --> 43:35.211
The final moment of life
is the most sacred,

43:35.279 --> 43:36.803
most private time.

43:38.349 --> 43:41.011
l hope you can accept
my sincere apologies

43:41.085 --> 43:43.019
for disturbing your traditions.

43:44.221 --> 43:46.712
Perhaps we've each misjudged
the other, Captain.

43:46.790 --> 43:48.189
l would hate to let that ruin

43:48.258 --> 43:50.658
any possibility of friendship
between our people.

43:53.697 --> 43:55.187
We must leave them.

43:58.369 --> 44:01.668
Tuvok, can your shuttle
make it back to Voyager?.

44:01.772 --> 44:03.740
Maybe we should wait for you.

44:03.774 --> 44:04.934
No, l'll be fine.

44:12.750 --> 44:15.150
We'll wait here
as long as you like.

44:15.219 --> 44:17.414
l know it's time.

44:17.521 --> 44:21.890
My only regret is leaving
my family, my grandson.

44:21.959 --> 44:23.950
You remind me of him sometimes.

44:26.864 --> 44:30.857
You will still be with them,
in their thoughts,

44:30.934 --> 44:34.836
as you will be in mine.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
