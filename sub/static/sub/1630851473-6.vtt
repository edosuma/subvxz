01:50.720 --> 01:54.080
The humble toilet is actually
an awe-inspiring feat of design.

01:54.120 --> 01:57.080
Its dimensions mean that a person
can't submerge

01:57.120 --> 01:59.240
their own nose and mouth.
Which is why,

01:59.280 --> 02:03.120
in spite of the fact that thousands
of people overindulge every weekend

02:03.160 --> 02:05.440
and end up
staring into a toilet bowl,

02:05.480 --> 02:08.680
the ones who drown
are more than just unlucky.

02:11.800 --> 02:13.840
They end up dead...

02:13.880 --> 02:18.240
..because somebody wants them dead.

02:32.840 --> 02:36.160
You've got er...gel or something.

02:36.200 --> 02:38.200
It's Toilet Duck.

02:38.240 --> 02:40.440
We definitely made it real
for the jury.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Are you all right, Mrs Harding?

02:45.040 --> 02:48.480
Stone changed his plea to guilty
after hearing your evidence.

02:49.480 --> 02:51.760
So Katie didn't die
because she were drunk.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.800
And now everybody knows it.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.800
Heal well, Mrs Harding.

03:00.360 --> 03:02.360
Truth matters.

03:02.400 --> 03:05.720
So it's a cold case?
It's not a cold case, it's a review.

03:05.760 --> 03:07.880
I didn't have my lanyard -
he mistook me for a student.

03:07.920 --> 03:10.320
Can you believe that?
Have you put faddy milk in this?

03:10.360 --> 03:12.960
Dairy is literally killing
the planet, Wolfe.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.160
I know, I just...
How do you even milk an almond?

03:15.200 --> 03:17.160
We're doing a review.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.280
Mm! Of what?

03:20.560 --> 03:22.560
Regina v Barnette.

03:23.640 --> 03:27.160
Barnette? Is that Fay Barnette?

03:27.200 --> 03:29.320
Who's that?

03:29.360 --> 03:31.360
Wolfe?

03:32.360 --> 03:34.360
Hello?

03:34.400 --> 03:38.360
Fay Barnette is Dominique's mum.
We're re-examining her case.

03:40.760 --> 03:42.840
Dominique doesn't deserve that!

03:43.840 --> 03:46.440
She lied her way in here,
so she could stalk you.

03:47.440 --> 03:51.000
She's basically Glenn Close
in a forensics suit!

03:51.040 --> 03:54.560
- She had her reasons.
- And she shagged
Steve under false pretences.

03:54.600 --> 03:57.920
Those were probably some of
the best shags of Steve's life!

03:59.080 --> 04:01.960
How can you forgive her easier
than you can forgive him?

04:02.000 --> 04:05.160
Because she has been motivated
by a deep-seated sense of...

04:05.200 --> 04:08.680
injustice and loss,
whereas he was motivated by his knob!

04:08.720 --> 04:11.040
Lift going up.

04:11.080 --> 04:13.360
Could you not stare at me in stereo?
It's disconcerting.

04:13.400 --> 04:16.160
You know I always back you
- on the big stuff.
- But?

04:16.200 --> 04:18.320
But please don't do this.

04:19.440 --> 04:23.440
Dominique believes - genuinely
believes - we got it wrong.
Doors opening.

04:23.480 --> 04:26.680
We've got to let her
discover otherwise.
What if we did get it wrong?

04:26.720 --> 04:29.880
Imagine telling that mother
this morning that the scumbag

04:29.920 --> 04:32.400
who drowned her daughter
is out on appeal

04:32.440 --> 04:34.800
because you have been struck off.

04:34.840 --> 04:36.920
That's not going to happen. OK?
Why?!

04:36.960 --> 04:40.360
Go on, we have a crime scene to get
to. I'll be there in a minute.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.480
A crime scene.

04:45.520 --> 04:48.720
He's manic, right?
He's back on his meds.

04:48.760 --> 04:51.400
You think actively helping someone
look for flaws in his work

04:51.440 --> 04:53.920
is entirely hinged behaviour?

04:53.960 --> 04:57.280
Bipolar is a spectrum, and he's at
his best when he's just on the line

04:57.320 --> 04:59.520
between mania and brilliance.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.560
And what if he's at his best now...

05:02.680 --> 05:05.680
..but he wasn't when the case
was first investigated?

05:55.920 --> 05:57.920
You OK?

05:59.880 --> 06:02.280
It's so real.

06:03.840 --> 06:07.440
I thought it might trigger a memory
of that day, but...nothing.

06:07.480 --> 06:09.720
Yeah, it's a defence mechanism.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.680
I can't remember anything
from before I was adopted.

06:12.720 --> 06:17.360
Well, except feeling really happy
about eating fish fingers.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.520
I bloody love a fish finger!

06:22.880 --> 06:25.400
Even rough childhoods
can have pockets of joy.

06:25.440 --> 06:28.560
You might need to cling on to that
today if things get tough.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.680
I'm not gonna cry at work, Steve.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.720
It's not in my makeup.

06:34.760 --> 06:37.200
And it would also fuck
with my makeup.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.720
This isn't a normal day
at the office, Dominique.

06:47.680 --> 06:49.960
Daddy bipolar bear's been busy.

06:53.440 --> 06:56.480
We managed to borrow a set
from the theatre.

06:56.520 --> 06:59.520
Yeah, they were supposed
to be rehearsing for Oedipus Rex,

06:59.560 --> 07:02.040
but Oedipus got chlamydia,
which he passed on to his mum

07:02.080 --> 07:05.360
and half the chorus.
Yeah, give up, Steve.

07:14.920 --> 07:18.720
The sudden death of an infant rarely
provides clues at post-mortem.

07:18.760 --> 07:21.000
The scene is vital, but in this case,

07:21.040 --> 07:23.240
we don't have the luxury
of visiting it.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.240
Do you want to brief us, Dominique?

07:32.440 --> 07:35.560
Paramedics were called
to the address at 6:47am

07:35.600 --> 07:37.920
to reports
of an unresponsive infant.

07:37.960 --> 07:40.480
They arrived to find the baby,
Jermaine Barnette,

07:40.520 --> 07:43.880
had been dead for some time.
The mother, Fay Barnette,

07:43.920 --> 07:47.280
claimed to have found the baby
deceased in his cot when she woke,

07:47.320 --> 07:49.760
but the police didn't believe her.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.920
And with Professor Wolfe's
evidence...

07:54.160 --> 07:56.680
..she was prosecuted
successfully for murder.

07:58.040 --> 08:00.600
I want us to approach this scene
as though it were real

08:00.640 --> 08:02.640
and we were seeing it
for the first time.

08:03.640 --> 08:05.640
Make some notes and report back.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.720
Tell me I didn't nail that.

08:11.760 --> 08:13.760
You nailed it.

08:25.320 --> 08:28.000
She should be taking her CV
to Jobcentre Plus,

08:28.040 --> 08:30.640
not walking around with a clipboard
like she's lead CSI.

08:30.680 --> 08:33.920
What is it you want, Maggy?
To see Dominique punished?

08:33.960 --> 08:35.960
Would that be so unreasonable?

08:36.000 --> 08:39.120
Whatever the outcome here,
her brother will still be dead,

08:39.160 --> 08:41.560
and she'll still have had
a motherless childhood.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.040
You don't think
she's been punished enough?

08:46.200 --> 08:49.320
But maybe we could also put
a written warning on her file.

08:52.240 --> 08:55.480
This was the first case I worked
where the victim was a baby.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.040
It's never left me.

09:00.680 --> 09:02.920
Jermaine's never left me.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.960
I hardly remember him at all.

09:07.440 --> 09:10.840
Soiled bedding.
Piles of unwashed laundry.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.000
Marks on the bathroom wall
that look like excrement.

09:13.040 --> 09:15.440
Minimal food in the cupboard
and fridge.

09:15.480 --> 09:17.360
Cider cans in the kitchen.

09:17.400 --> 09:20.360
Three-quarters-empty vodka bottle
- by the bed.
- Anything else?

09:20.400 --> 09:23.520
Multiple chains and bolts
- on the front door.
- Conclusions?

09:23.560 --> 09:26.320
The mother was neglectful,
possibly an alcoholic.

09:26.360 --> 09:30.080
Keen to keep prying eyes out. All
of which are red flags at the scene

09:30.120 --> 09:32.360
of a potential
domestic child homicide.

09:32.400 --> 09:35.280
She was also evasive
and inconsistent when questioned.

09:35.320 --> 09:37.320
Where's the evidence for that?

09:37.360 --> 09:39.720
The transcripts from
- the police interviews.
- No...

09:39.760 --> 09:41.600
where's the evidence for it here?
Dominique —

09:41.640 --> 09:44.880
We are supposed to be re-assessing
the crime scene only.

09:44.920 --> 09:48.080
You're right. Let's limit
our findings to what's here.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.000
My bad.
Just because there were a few cans,

09:50.040 --> 09:54.120
you can't assume she was
- an alcoholic.
- We can't be certain,
but it's reasonable to extrapolate.

09:54.160 --> 09:57.720
That's not science,
- that's guesswork.
- Sometimes,
this job requires a bit of both.

09:58.720 --> 10:01.280
Going to prison might have
stopped it in its tracks.

10:01.320 --> 10:05.240
But based on what's here...
I think we can safely say that

10:05.280 --> 10:07.480
she was caning it
around the time the baby died.

10:08.960 --> 10:11.880
Sorry, Dominique, but we all
have to keep an open mind.

10:11.920 --> 10:15.400
Any more thoughts or questions?
There was a second child
found at the scene.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.680
Where was she when
the paramedics arrived?

10:34.280 --> 10:36.280
I was found in there.

10:37.640 --> 10:39.680
Livor mortis becomes visible

10:39.720 --> 10:42.360
in the two hours
after the blood stops circulating,

10:42.400 --> 10:44.800
when it starts to settle
in the lowest parts of the body.

10:44.840 --> 10:47.240
The mother claimed to have
found the baby face down.

10:47.280 --> 10:51.360
Her defence argued it was possible
he rolled onto his front
and suffocated on his bedding.

10:51.400 --> 10:56.160
Wolfe testified that the lividity
meant Jermaine was on his back
when he died -

10:56.200 --> 10:59.520
that the mother was lying about
having found him on his front.

10:59.560 --> 11:02.640
But isn't it possible the paramedics
placed him on his back

11:02.680 --> 11:06.280
and the lividity formed in the hours
- following?
- It's not impossible.

11:06.320 --> 11:09.200
But they found the baby
on his front...

11:10.320 --> 11:13.600
..which means the defendant
made no attempt

11:13.640 --> 11:17.440
to pick up her unresponsive child,
which seems unlikely.

11:17.480 --> 11:20.520
Or that she picked him up,
discovered he was dead,

11:20.560 --> 11:23.440
then put him back down on his face.

11:26.160 --> 11:28.400
The only reason I can think of
for doing that

11:28.440 --> 11:31.680
would be an attempt
to stage the crime scene.

11:37.440 --> 11:39.840
I'm sorry.
Dominique.

11:42.560 --> 11:45.360
You don't think perhaps Tiny Tears
was a bit much, Steve? No?

11:45.400 --> 11:48.280
It was Dominique's idea.
She demanded this.

11:48.320 --> 11:52.000
Now she's not happy because
- the science is standing up.
- You
need to pull the plug on this one.

11:52.040 --> 11:56.120
No, you cannot do that to her!
She needs to know the truth.

11:56.160 --> 11:58.560
No, she needs to hear a version
of the truth she can live with.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.840
That is not the same thing.
She's a scientist.

12:00.880 --> 12:05.600
Yeah, and she is a daughter
and a sister, and this is cruel.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.720
You have put us in
a no-win situation.

12:09.760 --> 12:13.360
Either Dominique's right and you're
finished, or you're right,

12:13.400 --> 12:16.400
and God only knows what the hell
that's gonna do to her.

12:22.600 --> 12:25.240
Have I ever shown you
my pickled cancerous lung?

12:26.240 --> 12:29.280
It's not my lung, obviously,
it's from a sixty-a-day smoker

12:29.320 --> 12:31.640
that donated his body
to medical science.

12:32.760 --> 12:34.760
I thought this would be easier.

12:36.280 --> 12:39.400
We need to put your brother's
- case away, Dominique.
- Why?

12:40.440 --> 12:43.160
I didn't want to lose you from
the team, so I thought if I let you

12:43.200 --> 12:45.520
reach the same conclusions I had,
then I wouldn't have to.

12:45.560 --> 12:48.480
This is bigger than whether
I stay on your team or not.

12:49.480 --> 12:51.480
I know.

12:54.400 --> 12:57.280
My mum's coming up to the end
of her sentence...

12:58.280 --> 13:00.520
..which means she can get out
on licence.

13:01.520 --> 13:03.520
But she'd have to accept
her guilt...

13:06.440 --> 13:08.440
..and she won't.

13:09.640 --> 13:11.840
Who does that
unless they're innocent?

13:17.360 --> 13:20.000
Excuse me, Professor. Do you mind?

13:26.880 --> 13:29.680
Are we sure you're fit
for failure, mate?

13:31.400 --> 13:33.080
Thanks.

13:35.120 --> 13:37.360
Right. One of the strongest pieces
of evidence at trial

13:37.400 --> 13:40.120
was the fact white cotton fibres
were found in Jermaine's airway.

13:40.160 --> 13:43.240
Wolfe testified that they were
the same as these fibres,

13:43.280 --> 13:45.320
which were taken from a pillow
found in the cot.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.800
The prosecution presented this
as evidence the defendant

13:47.840 --> 13:49.920
had used the pillow
to suffocate Jermaine.

13:49.960 --> 13:52.400
It all looks like a match to me.

13:52.440 --> 13:55.080
But there's a limit
to how much detail

13:55.120 --> 13:57.120
a standard optical microscope
can show.

13:57.160 --> 13:59.720
Like with most of our work,
we have to make a judgement.

13:59.760 --> 14:02.880
Mine was that it's probable
the fibres came from the same source.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.960
But if you'd used
a scanning electron microscope,

14:05.000 --> 14:09.240
you'd have had an enhanced view
to make a more accurate judgement.
We didn't have a SEM back then.

14:09.280 --> 14:11.280
We have one now.

14:11.320 --> 14:14.680
Yeah, but the fibres need to be
coated in gold to make them conduct.

14:14.720 --> 14:18.320
They'll be destroyed, and we don't
have enough of them to do that.

14:19.320 --> 14:21.560
Evidence needs to be preserved
in case the defendant

14:21.600 --> 14:25.040
wants to appeal her case and get
further testing done on her behalf.

14:25.080 --> 14:27.040
I'd be doing it on her behalf.

14:33.760 --> 14:36.240
I suppose if we were
to film the process...

14:43.960 --> 14:46.000
That's beautiful.

14:46.040 --> 14:49.000
You could put that in a clip frame
and hang it on a wall.

14:50.240 --> 14:53.520
It's a picture of the fibres taken
from my dead brother's nostrils.

14:59.480 --> 15:02.000
And here are the test fibres
taken from the pillow,

15:02.040 --> 15:04.720
which in theory,
should look identical.

15:11.320 --> 15:15.320
The fibres from the pillow
are denser than the ones found in
Jermaine's airway.

15:15.360 --> 15:19.080
I can see.
So what does it mean?

15:20.120 --> 15:23.040
That the fibres didn't
- come from the pillow.
- I know that.

15:23.080 --> 15:26.160
I mean what does it mean for the
- case?
- It's completely undermined.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.280
Dominique got what she wanted.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.720
I want to hear it from Wolfe.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.240
I don't know what it means.

15:36.080 --> 15:39.480
I need to think. But it's great work,

15:39.520 --> 15:42.040
Dominique, really.

16:04.400 --> 16:08.160
Science isn't infallible. It's only
as good as the people using it.

16:09.160 --> 16:11.440
The fibres are just one piece
of the puzzle.

16:12.440 --> 16:15.560
It was the lividity evidence
that really convicted her.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.680
It showed she lied.
And people don't lie

16:17.720 --> 16:19.640
unless they've got
something to hide.

16:19.680 --> 16:22.240
And just because she didn't
use the pillow to smother him,

16:22.280 --> 16:24.400
it doesn't mean she didn't do it.

16:24.440 --> 16:26.440
Perhaps not.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.880
This blanket's white cotton -
she might've used this.

16:31.920 --> 16:34.600
And by placing it
in the washing machine afterwards,

16:34.640 --> 16:36.960
she thought
she was destroying the evidence.

16:37.960 --> 16:42.280
But we didn't collect the blanket
from the crime scene,
so we have no way of knowing.

16:42.320 --> 16:44.560
Yeah, that was my fault.

16:45.800 --> 16:49.240
I was lead CSI on this one.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.160
Really? Where was I?

16:53.200 --> 16:56.800
A surprise trip to Manic Land.

16:56.840 --> 16:59.920
Which I've always imagined
is a bit like Disney World,

16:59.960 --> 17:03.000
but with shittier scenery
and scarier rides.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.160
I'm so sorry.
No.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.200
I was out of my depth.

17:08.240 --> 17:10.480
And I've let everyone down.

17:10.520 --> 17:14.200
Course you haven't.
You had every reason to believe that
the pillow was the murder weapon.

17:14.240 --> 17:16.640
We can't take everything
from the crime scene.

17:16.680 --> 17:19.880
You should sack me now if it
comes to it, save the department.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.920
We're a team, Dot.

17:22.920 --> 17:26.040
The moment I stood up in court
and presented your findings,

17:26.080 --> 17:28.160
they became mine too.

17:28.200 --> 17:33.120
Yes. But how convinced are either
of us by those findings now, eh?

17:42.720 --> 17:46.480
If all you want out of this is
to get your mum's conviction quashed,
you probably have enough.

17:46.520 --> 17:49.040
But I also think you want to know
what happened to your brother.

17:49.080 --> 17:52.600
I already know. 'Sudden unexplained
death of a child or infant'.

17:52.640 --> 17:55.280
That's just a term we use when
we can't find the cause of death,

17:55.320 --> 17:57.400
and there's
no suspicious circumstances.

17:57.440 --> 18:00.000
It is not normal
for there to be cotton

18:00.040 --> 18:02.760
inside the nose and throat
of a baby.

18:02.800 --> 18:05.200
Or for a parent to lie about
the death of a child.

18:05.240 --> 18:07.320
Someone killed Jermaine.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.600
If not your mum, then someone else.

18:09.640 --> 18:11.720
I still firmly believe that.

18:16.440 --> 18:19.160
There was other DNA
found at the scene.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.800
You look stressed.

18:33.840 --> 18:36.720
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

18:36.760 --> 18:39.000
Sounds bad.
It's not.

18:39.040 --> 18:41.320
But I'm worried how you'll take it.

18:41.360 --> 18:44.640
You're really building it
up now, Dominique.

18:47.680 --> 18:49.760
I've been working on your case.

18:49.800 --> 18:55.120
My boss Wolfe Kinteh is the CSI
who testified at your trial.

18:55.160 --> 18:59.560
Why would you go and work with him?
Because I wanted to find out
how he arrived at his evidence.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.720
I never dreamt he'd end up
helping me with it.

19:01.760 --> 19:03.760
But he has.

19:03.800 --> 19:07.840
He says he's helping you,
but how can you believe him?

19:07.880 --> 19:10.440
He's already accepted
he was wrong about the pillow.

19:10.480 --> 19:12.560
He knows Jermaine
wasn't smothered with it.

19:12.600 --> 19:15.280
So he's saying it was
a cot death now, is he?

19:15.320 --> 19:17.200
No.

19:19.160 --> 19:21.160
What, then?

19:22.160 --> 19:25.680
He was thinking - both of us were -

19:25.720 --> 19:28.640
that someone else
might've been involved.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.920
Like who?

19:32.960 --> 19:36.360
There was DNA at the crime scene
belonging to Eric Haim.

19:38.360 --> 19:40.600
I was seeing him.
I remember.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.960
He used to hurt you.

19:44.960 --> 19:49.440
And if he was capable of that, maybe
he was capable of killing Jermaine.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.840
Nobody killed Jermaine.

19:56.840 --> 19:59.720
Why won't you let me help you
get out of here?

20:05.600 --> 20:08.680
All those things they said
about me in court -

20:08.720 --> 20:12.560
that I was a terrible mother.
- You weren't.
- I was, Dominique.

20:13.680 --> 20:16.360
I never smothered Jermaine...
Of course you didn't.

20:16.400 --> 20:19.040
..but that doesn't mean to say
I'm not guilty.

20:19.080 --> 20:22.440
So I don't want any help
to get out of here.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.640
I'm exactly where I should be.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.520
She's lying.

20:45.720 --> 20:47.880
How are we doing
with that flat number?

20:47.920 --> 20:49.920
No joy.

20:51.120 --> 20:53.320
How many flats do you reckon
are in here?

20:53.360 --> 20:55.400
Too many.

20:58.280 --> 21:00.960
Look, I don't know what kind of
place you were brought up in,

21:01.000 --> 21:04.320
but people in blocks like this
don't know their neighbours.

21:04.360 --> 21:07.360
Hi, there.
We're looking for a Mr Eric Haim.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.520
We understand that he lives
in this block, but we d-

21:09.560 --> 21:11.560
Oh, piss off!

21:12.560 --> 21:14.560
Many thanks.

21:14.600 --> 21:17.160
Can we go now?
Absolutely not.

21:19.520 --> 21:23.000
Hi, there. We're looking for a
Mr Eric Haim who lives in this block.

21:23.040 --> 21:25.840
Sorry, love,
I've never heard of him.

21:31.560 --> 21:34.120
You do realise
- you are entirely naked?
- Sorry, mate.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.160
I thought it were just her.

21:40.560 --> 21:43.600
Yeah?
Is your mum or dad in?

21:43.640 --> 21:46.800
My mum ain't back from work yet,
and my dad's asleep.

21:46.840 --> 21:48.960
Are you in there on your own?
I already told you.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
My dad's in bed asleep.

21:51.040 --> 21:53.160
I can see him from here.

21:53.200 --> 21:56.000
Go and get him.
He won't like being woken up.

21:56.040 --> 21:59.280
- Then, I'll wake him.
- Try if you like,
but he's wearing headphones.

21:59.320 --> 22:02.600
- Noise cancellers.
- Then, maybe we'll
wait out here until he does wake up.

22:02.640 --> 22:06.200
What are you doing?
I think he's home alone.

22:06.240 --> 22:09.560
- He says he's not.
- Well, as we know,
people don't always tell the truth.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.720
Yeah?
What's your name?

22:12.760 --> 22:15.280
I don't think so - stranger danger.

22:15.320 --> 22:18.360
You'll be asking me to come
and stroke your puppies next.

22:18.400 --> 22:20.400
How about I give you my phone -

22:20.440 --> 22:23.680
you take a photo of your dad
- to prove to us he's in there?
- OK!

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
That's my music!

22:36.040 --> 22:38.760
What?
He's nicked my bloody phone!

22:38.800 --> 22:42.760
Give me my phone back, you little
shit, or I'll break the door down!

22:42.800 --> 22:45.080
What are you laughing at?!

22:46.560 --> 22:48.800
I am cynical and suspicious, but...

22:49.800 --> 22:51.800
..that's what years of doing
this job has made me.

22:51.840 --> 22:54.680
I'm not going to apologise
for making sure the kid is safe.

22:54.720 --> 22:58.320
I wish someone had made sure
- you were.
- The system's all wrong.

22:58.360 --> 23:01.640
People don't get any help when they
can't cope, they get punished.

23:01.680 --> 23:05.480
That's why they hide it.

23:07.800 --> 23:09.800
What's going on?

23:11.880 --> 23:15.120
You shouldn't be
talking to kids through letterboxes.

23:15.160 --> 23:17.160
It's peculiar.

23:17.200 --> 23:19.200
Sleeping off a heavy one, mate?

23:19.240 --> 23:21.200
I don't drink, mate.

23:21.240 --> 23:24.040
- Drugs?
- If you've got something to
say, why don't you just come out -

23:24.080 --> 23:26.160
He hasn't. He hasn't.

23:26.200 --> 23:29.120
Look, we're really sorry
for the misunderstanding.

23:29.160 --> 23:31.600
I don't suppose you know
an Eric Haim, do you?

23:31.640 --> 23:33.640
He lives in one of these flats.

23:33.680 --> 23:37.000
Eric Haim doesn't live
in these flats. He owns them.

23:43.880 --> 23:46.320
Looks like he's doing
all right for himself.

23:47.520 --> 23:50.280
I don't think either of us
had a drink problem at the start.

23:50.320 --> 23:53.480
By the end, I were doing a six-pack
of cider every night...

23:53.520 --> 23:55.840
Fay was doing half a bottle
of vodka.

23:57.160 --> 24:00.080
Were you ever violent towards her?
No.

24:00.120 --> 24:02.800
Are you sure about that?
I'm no woman beater...

24:02.840 --> 24:04.920
although if I was,
I might've beaten her.

24:04.960 --> 24:07.000
She certainly knew
how to push my buttons.

24:07.040 --> 24:10.600
Some people are just toxic together.
That were me and Fay.

24:10.640 --> 24:13.680
We're here investigating the events
surrounding the death of her baby.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.960
I can't help you. I weren't there.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.920
Fay and me had one of our
ding-dongs, and she chucked me out.

24:18.960 --> 24:21.000
I didn't get back
till the early hours.

24:21.040 --> 24:23.440
And then what happened?

24:23.480 --> 24:27.640
I banged on the door for a bit,
shouted my sorries.

24:27.680 --> 24:31.960
Usually, I could win Fay round, but
that time she never let me back in.

24:32.000 --> 24:36.160
Police came to mine later that day,
told me she'd smothered the baby.

24:36.200 --> 24:40.000
You must've been devastated.
Yeah, tragic.

24:40.040 --> 24:45.000
But the kid weren't mine...
- thank fuck.
- Thank fuck.

24:46.120 --> 24:48.640
Thank you, Mr Haim.
You've been very helpful.

24:50.240 --> 24:52.240
My card.

24:52.280 --> 24:55.200
No, thanks. I'm going paperless.

25:00.480 --> 25:03.720
Oh, she had a daughter
as well as a baby.

25:04.880 --> 25:08.680
Timid little mouse. I sometimes
wonder what happened to her.

25:11.120 --> 25:13.920
I reckon he came back to the house,
and Mum let him in.

25:13.960 --> 25:17.280
Then, why isn't she telling us that?
Because she's scared of him.

25:17.320 --> 25:19.600
Maybe back then, but why now?

25:19.640 --> 25:21.640
It's not as if he can get to her.

25:22.760 --> 25:25.600
I can see his eyes
staring through the letterbox...

25:26.600 --> 25:28.600
..as clear as if it was yesterday.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Fear like that doesn't leave you.

25:36.200 --> 25:38.200
Let's get you home.

26:06.400 --> 26:08.400
Thanks.

26:13.080 --> 26:16.680
The Professor's on the piss!

26:19.240 --> 26:21.640
I'm conducting an experiment!

26:56.920 --> 26:58.920
I thought I might find
you in a hole.

26:59.960 --> 27:02.760
How are you feeling?

27:02.800 --> 27:05.080
Like a man
who's losing his superpowers.

27:06.120 --> 27:09.040
Is this the end of the road
for Manicman?

27:09.080 --> 27:12.000
Nah. I tripped
and tried to jump Betsy.

27:12.040 --> 27:15.200
- Ooh.
- So I was thinking
of going with... Twatman.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.600
That won't help.

27:20.640 --> 27:23.040
I'm conducting an experiment.

27:23.080 --> 27:25.240
Into things that won't help?

27:25.280 --> 27:27.360
Uh...

27:27.400 --> 27:29.920
I can't spare any of this vodka,
but I have...

27:29.960 --> 27:32.880
a bottle up there.
I think...last year's Secret Santa.

27:32.920 --> 27:34.920
I'm guessing Dot.

27:40.880 --> 27:42.880
I'm not getting drunk with you.

27:43.880 --> 27:45.880
I'm not asking you to get drunk.

27:46.880 --> 27:49.600
I'm asking you not to leave me alone
in a hole.

27:49.640 --> 27:51.680
♪World A Music

27:54.960 --> 27:58.200
I'm best on the days
when the thoughts come quicker...

27:58.240 --> 28:00.360
than I have the words
to articulate them.

28:00.400 --> 28:03.640
And other days,
you're methodical and considered.

28:03.680 --> 28:08.480
It's all part of you, Wolfe. It's
what makes you good at what you do.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.080
But you didn't fall for that guy,
now, did you?

28:11.120 --> 28:14.080
When I think about our glory nights,
I don't think about...

28:14.120 --> 28:17.080
'methodical and considered'.
Our glory nights?!

28:17.120 --> 28:20.080
Yeah!
Skinny-dipping in Platt Fields.

28:20.120 --> 28:22.840

Disabled toilet at Sankeys.

28:26.600 --> 28:29.440
You're basically listing times
that we had good sex.

28:29.480 --> 28:33.240
We always had good sex. I'm listing
times we had transcendent sex.

28:33.280 --> 28:36.080
Soulmate sex.

28:36.120 --> 28:39.920
Oh, please tell me coming off
the meds wasn't about me.

28:41.120 --> 28:44.200
Pretty much everything I've done
- since 2003 has been about you.
- No...

28:44.240 --> 28:45.760
And then Flick.

28:47.280 --> 28:49.760
I have loved every inch of you.

28:49.800 --> 28:54.840
Whether you were high or low,
or in a hole, that didn't change.

28:55.840 --> 28:58.200
You just...

28:58.240 --> 29:02.200
..you just kept chasing this...
better version of yourself.

29:02.240 --> 29:05.800
And it's that...
that I couldn't live with.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.520
Yet here I am,
still living with it...

29:11.600 --> 29:13.880
..with no possibility of parole.

29:15.600 --> 29:18.160
Twatman returns.

29:21.600 --> 29:23.640

29:25.720 --> 29:28.400
I'm an idiot.
Yes, yes, you are.

29:28.440 --> 29:31.600
I'm an insufferable moron.
Yep.

29:31.640 --> 29:33.800
An irredeemable knob.

29:36.360 --> 29:38.360
Tell me more.

29:38.400 --> 29:40.600
I'm a complete wazzock...

29:40.640 --> 29:43.080
a bumbling buffoon.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Where are we?

30:28.680 --> 30:30.680
I feel like I'm home.

30:32.360 --> 30:34.720
I'd better get home...

30:35.840 --> 30:37.960
..before Flick...

30:38.000 --> 30:40.960
..before Flick gets back
from Rosalind's

30:41.000 --> 30:43.600
and witnesses my walk of shame.

30:51.560 --> 30:53.920
On point, even when pissed.

30:55.400 --> 30:58.560
Have you seen my phone?

30:58.600 --> 31:00.400
It's in the fridge.

31:16.600 --> 31:19.560
Betsy, what are you doing here?
You sent me a text.

31:19.600 --> 31:22.600
Several texts...
at two o'clock this morning.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.640
Fairly incoherent,

31:24.680 --> 31:27.600
but the gist seemed to be that you
wanted me to bring you one of these.

31:27.640 --> 31:29.840
Ah. I'm conducting an experiment.

31:29.880 --> 31:32.600
As you're very fond
of reminding me,

31:32.640 --> 31:34.920
you get a more accurate result
with a blood test in the lab

31:34.960 --> 31:37.000
than we do with a puffer
on the side of the road.

31:37.040 --> 31:40.600
Yes. I'm replicating
particular conditions.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.680
Morning, Betsy.
Oh, hi, Val.

31:53.200 --> 31:55.320
Congratulations in order?

31:55.360 --> 31:57.360
I don't think it means anything.

31:57.400 --> 31:59.440
Everything means something.

31:59.480 --> 32:01.720
Blow into that.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.760
Are you here to admit
you made a mistake?

32:07.800 --> 32:09.880
I did make a mistake.

32:09.920 --> 32:12.800
I thought the pillow
was the murder weapon. But now...

32:13.800 --> 32:15.720
I suspect it was this.

32:18.280 --> 32:20.440
I conducted an experiment yesterday.

32:20.480 --> 32:24.040
I drank the same amount of vodka
you did on the night Jermaine died.

32:24.080 --> 32:26.520
This morning, I was breathalysed
about the time you were

32:26.560 --> 32:29.920
the morning of your arrest. Our blood
alcohol level was about the same,

32:29.960 --> 32:33.080
give or take -
but here's the thing.

32:33.120 --> 32:36.440
At 5:00am this morning,
the approximate time which we think

32:36.480 --> 32:39.600
Jermaine died,
I was out for the count.

32:39.640 --> 32:41.640
My wife wasn't very happy.

32:41.680 --> 32:45.840
I'd set an alarm on my phone
just to see how drunk I'd be.

32:45.880 --> 32:49.680
Only she couldn't wake me,
and she couldn't turn off the alarm.

32:49.720 --> 32:52.920
Is this supposed to mean something?
I'm a fair bit bigger than you,

32:52.960 --> 32:55.960
so if I wasn't conscious,
you weren't either.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.760
But the only DNA
we found in that house

32:59.800 --> 33:02.520
was yours and Eric Haim's.

33:03.760 --> 33:05.760
Why are you covering for him?

33:07.520 --> 33:10.400
People like you always
have to be right, don't you?

33:10.440 --> 33:12.320
You have to know everything.

33:12.360 --> 33:14.640
I'm already rotting away in here.

33:14.680 --> 33:18.440
No chance of getting out,
but still, you keep pushing it.

33:18.480 --> 33:20.480
Still you won't let it go.

33:24.360 --> 33:27.160
Is it a confession you want?

33:27.200 --> 33:29.320
Do you need to hear me say it?

33:33.480 --> 33:35.480
I killed him.

33:35.520 --> 33:37.520
There.

33:38.640 --> 33:42.080
It's said. I killed Jermaine.

33:42.120 --> 33:45.320
I snapped, and I smothered him.

33:49.280 --> 33:51.360
Where are you going?

33:51.400 --> 33:54.560
Tell Dominique...
not to come here again.

33:54.600 --> 33:58.280
Fay, please -
And if you give a shit about her...

33:59.760 --> 34:01.760
..tell her to let it go.

34:04.640 --> 34:07.880
Fay.
Come on.

34:18.800 --> 34:21.760
You know what I'm looking forward to
when all this is over?

34:21.800 --> 34:24.920
Getting your mum back?
Yeah, course. But...

34:25.920 --> 34:27.920
..also just being normal.

34:27.960 --> 34:30.560
I want to go on holiday
without feeling guilty.

34:31.560 --> 34:33.720
Yeah, you should definitely do that.

34:33.760 --> 34:36.360
I've always fancied Paris. But...

34:37.480 --> 34:40.760
..we can try somewhere different
if you've already been.

34:42.360 --> 34:44.640
No, Paris sounds good.

34:47.760 --> 34:52.240
Wolfe? We should discuss
what we're going to do with
the new fibre evidence.

34:52.280 --> 34:54.480
You've got the evidence,
do with it what you must.

34:54.520 --> 34:56.600
But you said we were
- going to see it through.
- I have.

34:56.640 --> 35:00.400
No. Seeing it through means
agreeing what happened...as a team.

35:00.440 --> 35:04.560
Do you have any idea how much
it costs to run a lab like ours?

35:06.440 --> 35:09.520
You got a freebie, but it's time
to get back to our proper work.

35:10.520 --> 35:13.640
You're just the same as every other
do-gooder who spent five minutes

35:13.680 --> 35:16.560
looking like they might be helpful.
I never meant to let you down.

35:16.600 --> 35:18.600
Yeah. No-one ever does.

35:18.640 --> 35:22.080
But you've chosen to save
your reputation, haven't you, Wolfe?

35:24.080 --> 35:27.280
And I'll never forgive you
for putting that above the truth.

35:27.320 --> 35:29.040
Let it go, Dominique.

35:29.080 --> 35:32.040
My life has been put on hold
ever since my brother died,

35:32.080 --> 35:35.320
and it won't restart again
until I know what happened to him.

35:36.320 --> 35:41.000
Because there's nothing...
worse than not knowing.

35:46.080 --> 35:48.080
Let's go to my office.
No.

35:48.120 --> 35:51.400
You can say what you've got to say
right here, in front of everyone.

35:51.440 --> 35:53.760
Please, Dominique.
It needs to be in private.

35:53.800 --> 35:56.160
I said no.

36:14.480 --> 36:16.920
I believe the fibres
came from this blanket.

36:19.400 --> 36:21.760
You can't prove that.
I know.

36:22.760 --> 36:24.880
So that's your answer, is it?

36:24.920 --> 36:27.840
You were right about the smothering,
it's just the weapon you got wrong?

36:27.880 --> 36:29.960
I no longer think
Jermaine was smothered.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.480
I think he suffocated
inside the washing machine.

36:37.480 --> 36:39.480
What?

36:39.520 --> 36:41.560
The machine was switched off, but...

36:42.560 --> 36:44.520
..the barrel, it's airtight.

36:44.560 --> 36:48.160
So once the door was shut,
he ran out of oxygen.

36:49.520 --> 36:53.120
The blanket was on or near his face
while that happened.

36:53.160 --> 36:55.640
It doesn't make any sense. Why...

36:55.680 --> 36:58.440
Why would she use
the washing machine to kill him?

36:58.480 --> 37:00.720
Nobody was trying to kill Jermaine.

37:06.440 --> 37:08.440
They were trying to protect him.

37:14.760 --> 37:16.760
She must've been so frightened.

37:18.280 --> 37:22.600
Eric Haim was drunk,
hammering on the door.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.480
She knew what he was capable of.
She tried...

37:27.480 --> 37:30.720
..to wake her mum up,
but Fay was out of it. So...

37:32.880 --> 37:35.360
..she picked up Jermaine...
No.

37:35.400 --> 37:38.320
She picked up Jermaine,

37:38.360 --> 37:41.000
and she carefully carried him...

37:41.040 --> 37:43.040
..to the washing machine.

37:45.240 --> 37:49.600
Nah, nah. No. That's not right.

37:49.640 --> 37:52.280
And she placed him inside...

37:53.280 --> 37:55.200
No.

37:56.400 --> 37:59.120
..to keep him safe from Eric Haim.

38:03.400 --> 38:05.840
I'm so sorry, Dominique.

38:08.440 --> 38:10.880
So he would be safe.

38:12.280 --> 38:15.920
So he would be safe.

38:20.320 --> 38:22.320
I'm sorry.

38:25.560 --> 38:27.920
I said I wanted the truth.

38:28.960 --> 38:31.120
Turns out I wanted a soothing lie.

38:32.840 --> 38:35.160
The truth has always been
like a faith to me.

38:35.200 --> 38:37.800
But today's the first time
I had it tested.

38:37.840 --> 38:40.920
I found myself wondering - if
the facts don't always bring comfort,

38:40.960 --> 38:43.880
then maybe there are some things
better left buried.

38:46.800 --> 38:49.400
I don't even know what
I'm going to say to my mum.

38:54.240 --> 38:56.600
She might have thought
she was protecting me, but...

38:57.600 --> 39:01.000
..I'd rather have known the truth
and had her around.

39:04.920 --> 39:07.720
I bet you can deal with a lot
if you've got a mum.

39:08.720 --> 39:10.920
You and her
will have plenty of time...

39:12.400 --> 39:14.400
..to go through all of that.

39:14.440 --> 39:17.600
In the meantime,
you need to take this new evidence

39:17.640 --> 39:19.840
and put it into
an appeal application.

39:19.880 --> 39:22.680
Me?
It's your case, Dominique.

39:22.720 --> 39:25.960
And when you've finished,
you'll have another.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
And another after that.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.360
I'm not sure I can do this now.

39:31.400 --> 39:34.560
You can...and you will.

39:34.600 --> 39:39.200
Because you are that very rare
and special breed of CSI

39:39.240 --> 39:42.160
who knows that this job is a lot less
about data and death

39:42.200 --> 39:44.200
than it is about people.

39:47.800 --> 39:52.440
Listen, Valerie, there's something
I want to say. Something important.

39:52.480 --> 39:55.440
Something long... Jesus!
What are you doing?

39:55.480 --> 39:57.520
I honestly don't know.

39:58.520 --> 40:01.080
Have you and Mum had a row?
Worse.

40:01.120 --> 40:03.600
Oh, my God, you've had sex!

40:03.640 --> 40:07.600
That's a very astute pick up.
Oh, please don't tell me any more.

40:07.640 --> 40:10.000
But also,
please try not to upset her.

40:10.040 --> 40:12.760
I can't remember the last time
I saw her as happy as she was today.

40:12.800 --> 40:15.000
Really?
Oh, no, I can, actually.

40:15.040 --> 40:17.040
Yeah, the day you moved out.

40:33.680 --> 40:36.960
What is it?
Divorce papers.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.720
You enjoyed last night, then.
More than anything, actually.

40:40.760 --> 40:43.200
And if there is any possibility

40:43.240 --> 40:45.560
that it has ignited
even the tiniest amount of hope,

40:45.600 --> 40:48.160
then I am here
and ready to blow on it.

40:48.200 --> 40:50.200
Weird.

40:50.240 --> 40:52.600
And to try my best
not to extinguish it.

40:52.640 --> 40:55.720
Step away from the metaphor.
But if you decide...

40:56.720 --> 40:58.720
..that there is no hope...

40:59.720 --> 41:02.040
..um...there's the parole you wanted.

41:02.080 --> 41:05.480
And I am sorry that I didn't give it
to you when you first asked.

41:07.360 --> 41:10.040
Is there blank paper in this?
No.

41:11.160 --> 41:13.240
You can't blame me
for being suspicious.

41:13.280 --> 41:16.720
I can't. Which is why
if we come out of this as friends,

41:16.760 --> 41:18.960
Valerie,
it'll be more than I deserve.

41:20.600 --> 41:22.600
Thank you.

41:25.280 --> 41:27.280
It means a lot.

41:55.240 --> 41:57.360
Come here.

42:02.840 --> 42:04.880
Dominique's going to be OK.

42:04.920 --> 42:08.400
I truly believe that...because
she has the support of her family.

42:08.440 --> 42:10.920
Which, make no mistake -
that's what we are.

42:11.920 --> 42:14.840
You couldn't do this job
with colleagues alone.

42:15.840 --> 42:18.240
I've not been her biggest fan,
but...

42:18.280 --> 42:20.400
..I wouldn't wish that
on my worst enemy.

42:20.440 --> 42:22.920
Yep.
That's empathy.

42:22.960 --> 42:26.480
OK, I'll be right there.

42:27.600 --> 42:30.520
Eat up, we've got a scene.
Complex case?

42:30.560 --> 42:34.040
A dead skydiver in a field.
Doesn't sound very complex.

42:34.080 --> 42:36.960
He wasn't wearing a parachute.
Ooh!

42:37.000 --> 42:39.880
You were all thinking it.

42:39.920 --> 42:43.520
All right,
I'll go straight there with you.
Maggy, Dot, go get the stuff.

42:43.560 --> 42:47.240
Er... What about me?
You're going to go to Dominique's.

42:47.280 --> 42:49.840
We don't leave family alone
in a hole.

42:50.840 --> 42:53.400
But we also don't shag them, Steve.

42:56.480 --> 42:58.480
Yep, course.
