03:00.908 --> 03:03.074
from Belle Chasse.
He's been UA since Friday.

03:03.076 --> 03:05.677
Cause of death appears to
be three GSWs to the back.

03:05.679 --> 03:07.479
Based on the water temperature

03:07.481 --> 03:09.514
and skin slippage,
I'd estimate the body's

03:09.516 --> 03:11.349
been submerged two to four days.

03:11.351 --> 03:13.318
Suggests he was killed
shortly after he went missing.

And not for personal use.

09:09.709 --> 09:11.676
More like gathering evidence.

09:11.678 --> 09:13.578
Theo was a master-at-arms.

09:13.580 --> 09:16.648
He working a narcotics case?
PATTON: He was given

09:16.650 --> 09:18.082
a surveillance detail,
going after

09:18.084 --> 09:19.551
drug dealers near the base.

09:19.553 --> 09:21.352
He had access to some
advanced equipment.

09:21.354 --> 09:22.520
Motion-activated cameras

09:22.522 --> 09:24.522
with audio and video feed.
SONJA: Theo checked

09:24.524 --> 09:26.357
one of them out a few days
before he was killed.

09:26.359 --> 09:29.661
His commander says he has no
idea where the equipment is now.

09:29.663 --> 09:31.863
PATTON: See, once these
cameras are installed,

09:31.865 --> 09:34.132
the user can access them
on the cloud from any location.

09:34.134 --> 09:35.714
Does that mean
you can access it, too?

09:35.715 --> 09:36.902
Well, I haven't gotten the feed yet.

09:36.903 --> 09:39.337
But I did trace the signal.

09:40.206 --> 09:41.372
PRIDE:
Delilah's.

09:41.374 --> 09:43.341
SONJA: Theo Rollins
was monitoring

09:43.343 --> 09:44.509
your friend's club.

09:44.511 --> 09:46.578
May have gotten
killed for it.

09:46.580 --> 09:47.812
Okay...

09:47.814 --> 09:49.581
so we dig deeper.

09:49.583 --> 09:51.883
Patton, get into that
camera feed, all right?

09:51.885 --> 09:53.251
I want to know
what Theo was recording.

09:53.253 --> 09:55.720
Sonja, Gregorio,
take a closer look

09:55.722 --> 09:57.622
at Delilah's--
if drugs were coming out,

09:57.624 --> 09:59.223
there'll be more evidence.

09:59.225 --> 10:02.660
Christopher, I need you to
check in with your CIs.

10:03.530 --> 10:05.163
Hey.

10:05.165 --> 10:07.465
What's wrong?

10:07.467 --> 10:09.534
My dad.

10:09.536 --> 10:11.669
He's dead.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.734
He was out on
the balcony,

10:31.822 --> 10:34.590
drinking coffee,
reading the paper.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.458
All the sudden...

10:36.460 --> 10:38.660
collapsed.

10:38.662 --> 10:41.230
Gone before the
ambulance got there.

10:43.300 --> 10:45.334
I'm so sorry, Chris.

10:45.336 --> 10:49.805
He tried calling me
this morning, you know?

10:51.075 --> 10:53.508
I didn't answer.

10:53.510 --> 10:56.245
Come on, don't-don't do that
to yourself.

10:56.247 --> 10:59.147
Last conversation we had
was an argument.

11:00.384 --> 11:03.151
I know things didn't
end well that night.

11:05.222 --> 11:07.623
But your father loved you.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.358
You got to know that.

11:09.360 --> 11:11.760
Yeah.

11:11.762 --> 11:14.162
But I should have
answered his call.

11:14.164 --> 11:18.000
Why didn't I?

11:18.002 --> 11:21.203
'Cause you didn't know
any of this was gonna happen.

11:25.075 --> 11:27.509
I got to get home.
Yeah.

11:27.511 --> 11:30.979
Absolutely.

11:37.688 --> 11:40.489
You okay, Country Mouse?

11:40.491 --> 11:42.858
I think so.

11:42.860 --> 11:44.693
I don't know.

11:44.695 --> 11:47.529
Hey, you need anything,
we're here for you, you hear me?

11:47.531 --> 11:49.998
Feel like I'm leaving
y'all hanging.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.867
No.

11:51.869 --> 11:53.602
You go to your family.

11:53.604 --> 11:57.072
Come on, I'll
walk you out.

12:04.548 --> 12:06.581
PRIDE: Know we're all hurting
for Christopher.

12:06.583 --> 12:07.983
He's gonna need our support.

12:07.985 --> 12:13.155
And we'll be here for
him when he needs us.

12:13.157 --> 12:16.391
But right now, we got to be
here for Theo Rollins, too.

12:18.896 --> 12:22.798
Find his killer. Patton,
that surveillance equipment

12:22.800 --> 12:24.700
at Delilah's still operating?
Yeah.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.835
It's motion-activated. I'm
working on accessing the feed.

12:26.837 --> 12:28.170
All right, keep at it.

12:28.172 --> 12:29.705
What'd you learn
at Delilah's?

12:29.707 --> 12:31.306
Well, I didn't find
any direct connection

12:31.308 --> 12:32.941
between the club
and the drug trade,

12:32.943 --> 12:35.310
but I did find out your friend's
club was on the verge

12:35.312 --> 12:37.546
of bankruptcy
a few months back.

12:37.548 --> 12:39.181
Days away from
foreclosure.

12:39.183 --> 12:41.550
All of a sudden,
the debts are wiped out.

12:41.552 --> 12:44.119
Mortgage and vendors are paid
up, place is flush with cash.

12:44.121 --> 12:46.722
No record of bank loans,
new credit lines.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.757
Sudden windfall that's all cash?
Sounds like drug money.

12:48.759 --> 12:50.225
PRIDE:
Yeah, sounds like it.

12:50.227 --> 12:51.827
But it's not proof.

12:51.829 --> 12:54.363
Felix has a new partner--
Neil Clydell.

12:54.365 --> 12:55.931
I met him this morning.

12:55.933 --> 12:57.632
Could be the reason
for the cash.

12:57.634 --> 12:59.101
GREGORIO: We'll run
background on him.

12:59.103 --> 13:01.603
Yeah, good, and I need
you two to go check in

13:01.605 --> 13:03.638
with Loretta and Sebastian,
see if they've learned anything

13:03.640 --> 13:05.907
from the autopsy.
Theo believed

13:05.909 --> 13:08.677
something bad was happening at
Delilah's, but to move forward,

13:08.679 --> 13:10.812
we need hard evidence,
not theories.

13:10.814 --> 13:12.214
GREGORIO:
Okay.

13:17.955 --> 13:19.721
(jet airplane passing)

13:22.726 --> 13:25.127
(piano music playing)

13:25.129 --> 13:26.728
(light chatter)

13:28.932 --> 13:31.133
(sighs)

13:32.903 --> 13:35.370
Christopher?
Rose.

13:35.372 --> 13:37.639
You made it.

13:37.641 --> 13:39.875
How you doing?

13:39.877 --> 13:42.978
Well, we all knew it was
going to happen at some point.

13:42.980 --> 13:46.014
Just doesn't make it
any easier, does it?

13:46.016 --> 13:48.784
Well, what do you
mean, "We all knew"?

13:48.786 --> 13:50.786
That Beau was sick.

13:50.788 --> 13:53.188
His heart.

13:53.190 --> 13:56.925
I-I know he told you when
he came to New Orleans

13:56.927 --> 13:58.326
the other month.
That was...

13:58.328 --> 14:00.896
what the trip
was all about.

14:00.898 --> 14:02.931
Rose, he...

14:02.933 --> 14:04.800
he didn't say a word about it.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.668
(sighs)

14:06.670 --> 14:10.238
Your daddy was... unique,
wasn't he?

14:10.240 --> 14:11.773
Stubborn, too.

14:11.775 --> 14:16.144
But he shouldn't have
left you in the dark.

14:16.146 --> 14:17.612
What about Cade?

14:17.614 --> 14:19.714
I tried calling him
after we talked

14:19.716 --> 14:20.882
and couldn't get through.

14:20.884 --> 14:23.919
Your brother had
another bad spell.

14:23.921 --> 14:25.654
He checked back into
that facility in Auburn.

14:25.656 --> 14:28.023
I didn't have the heart
to call up there.

14:28.025 --> 14:30.892
Thought you might
like to be the one to.

14:30.894 --> 14:33.428
Yes, ma'am.
I'll handle it.

14:33.430 --> 14:35.831
We also have to figure
out the funeral.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.999
Beau left detailed
instructions, of course.

14:38.001 --> 14:41.837
There's just
so much to do.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.972
Rose, hey, it's okay, all right?

14:43.974 --> 14:46.775
I'm... I'm here now,
all right?

14:46.777 --> 14:48.977
Whatever you need,
I'm here to help you.

14:48.979 --> 14:50.378
Thank you.

14:50.380 --> 14:52.881
I'm so glad you're
here, Christopher.

14:52.883 --> 14:55.717
WOMAN:
Chris Lasalle,

14:55.719 --> 14:57.185
always there when
you need him.

14:57.187 --> 14:58.520
Rachel Modine.
Yeah.

14:58.522 --> 14:59.721
(both chuckle)

14:59.723 --> 15:01.990
Wow, it's been...
How long has it been?

15:01.992 --> 15:04.226
Uh, graduation,
I think.

15:04.228 --> 15:07.095
Still wore braids
in my hair.

15:07.097 --> 15:08.063
I'm so sorry

15:08.065 --> 15:09.664
about your dad, Chris.

15:09.666 --> 15:11.266
Thank you.

15:12.536 --> 15:14.202
It means a lot
that you're here.

15:14.204 --> 15:17.005
Of course I came.
I'm your father's attorney.

15:17.007 --> 15:19.708
Your attorney now.
(scoffs)

15:19.710 --> 15:22.611
Seems like I'm the last one
to know anything around here.

15:22.613 --> 15:24.980
Been working with your dad
for two years.

15:24.982 --> 15:27.682
Looking forward
to working with you.

15:27.684 --> 15:28.884
Working on what?

15:28.886 --> 15:31.620
On everything.

15:31.622 --> 15:34.189
Beau named you
executor of the estate.

15:36.827 --> 15:38.760
LASALLE:
<i>He can't do that, right?</i>

15:38.762 --> 15:40.529
Not without my permission.

15:40.531 --> 15:43.665
Actually, he can,
and he did.

15:43.667 --> 15:45.700
(scoffs)
Unbelievable.

15:45.702 --> 15:47.769
Obviously, I assumed
he already told you all this.

15:47.771 --> 15:50.071
Well, he didn't.
Guess that means

15:50.073 --> 15:51.706
he didn't tell you
you're in charge

15:51.708 --> 15:53.241
of Lasalle Enterprises as well.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.809
You're kidding.

15:56.046 --> 15:57.712
No, of course you're not.

15:57.714 --> 15:59.114
Beau said

15:59.116 --> 16:01.283
you had discussed
taking over the business.

16:01.285 --> 16:03.185
He came down and wanted me
to sign some papers.

16:03.187 --> 16:05.921
I already told him
I had a life and career.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.355
Foolishly,

16:07.357 --> 16:09.324
I thought that was
the end of it.

16:09.326 --> 16:10.792
Well, it's not.

16:10.794 --> 16:15.497
Because Beau's gone now,
and... you're the boss.

16:15.499 --> 16:19.201
(chuckles)
That's my father for you.

16:19.203 --> 16:22.904
Even in death,
he gets the last word.

16:28.979 --> 16:31.179
WADE: <i>I recovered the bullet</i>
<i>from Mr. Rollins's body.</i>

16:31.181 --> 16:34.416
There's no sign of
foreign DNA or prints.

16:34.418 --> 16:36.851
Yeah, the lake washed away
most of the trace evidence.

16:36.853 --> 16:38.486
Most, not all?
No.

16:38.488 --> 16:39.854
Those cuts on Theo's face--

16:39.856 --> 16:42.090
based on the petechial bruising,

16:42.092 --> 16:45.293
I'd say the impact happened
concurrently with death.

16:45.295 --> 16:48.096
I also extracted
paint chips lodged

16:48.098 --> 16:49.564
in the tissues.
Right,

16:49.566 --> 16:50.865
and then I took
a photomicrograph

16:50.867 --> 16:52.734
of those paint chips
just to get a closer look.

16:52.736 --> 16:53.735
This is lead-based paint.

16:53.737 --> 16:55.837
There's several
coats of it, too.

16:55.839 --> 16:57.372
This stuff's been banned
since the '70s.

16:57.374 --> 16:58.740
Does it make it easier to trace?

16:58.742 --> 17:00.175
Well, in this
particular case,

17:00.177 --> 17:02.277
yeah, because this top layer,
it's this-this pale green.

17:02.279 --> 17:05.579
It's an exact match
to the exterior of Delilah's.

17:05.582 --> 17:07.415
Yeah, and I took a little
field trip out to the club.

17:07.416 --> 17:09.550
Went through the place
with a fine-tooth comb

17:09.553 --> 17:11.185
until I found this
in the back alley--

17:11.188 --> 17:12.153
nine millimeter casing.

17:12.155 --> 17:14.122
WADE: Same caliber
as the slug I pulled

17:14.124 --> 17:15.390
from the victim.
Yeah, I still have to

17:15.392 --> 17:17.224
run ballistics to
confirm, but...

17:17.227 --> 17:19.461
Theo Rollins was killed
right behind Delilah's.

17:19.463 --> 17:21.195
On a night when
Felix Hill denies

17:21.198 --> 17:23.365
even seeing him in his club.

17:23.367 --> 17:25.267
Mm.

17:25.269 --> 17:27.602
SEBASTIAN:
<i>Guys, I got something.</i>

17:27.604 --> 17:29.504
But it's one of those good news,
bad news kind of things.

17:29.506 --> 17:30.672
SONJA:
What's the good news?

17:30.674 --> 17:31.906
Patton accessed the camera

17:31.908 --> 17:33.141
that Theo installed
in Delilah's.

17:33.143 --> 17:35.243
What's on it?
That's the bad news.

17:35.245 --> 17:37.579
The camera was monitoring
Felix's office.

17:37.581 --> 17:39.314
Pride's not gonna
like what he sees.

17:39.316 --> 17:42.150
Whatever it is, Sebastian,
I'll deal with it.

17:42.152 --> 17:43.385
Roger that.

17:45.656 --> 17:46.788
PRIDE:
That's Felix's office.

17:46.790 --> 17:48.490
SEBASTIAN: Yeah, the camera
went up a few days

17:48.492 --> 17:50.091
before Theo was killed.
Most of the footage

17:50.093 --> 17:51.459
is pretty boring stuff--
you know,

17:51.461 --> 17:52.794
Felix answering phones,
paying bills.

17:52.796 --> 17:55.063
- No smoking gun.
- So why am I gonna be upset?

17:55.065 --> 17:56.665
Because of what was
recorded this morning,

17:56.667 --> 17:59.267
after you and Lasalle
interviewed him.

18:01.438 --> 18:02.637
Why did you lie to them?

18:02.639 --> 18:03.972
FELIX:
Not now, Josie.

18:03.974 --> 18:05.340
JOSIE:
You said you hadn't seen Theo.

18:05.342 --> 18:07.309
But I saw you two arguing
the day he died.

18:07.311 --> 18:08.710
Why didn't you
just tell Mr. Dwayne?

18:08.712 --> 18:10.445
FELIX:
It's complicated.

18:10.447 --> 18:12.547
JOSIE:
Well, then explain it to me.

18:12.549 --> 18:15.317
I told Theo to let it go
or he'd get hurt,

18:15.319 --> 18:16.985
but he just kept
messing with it.

18:16.987 --> 18:18.586
JOSIE:
Let what go? Messing with what?

18:18.588 --> 18:20.622
FELIX: Josie, no more questions,
all right? I'll handle it.

18:20.624 --> 18:24.059
But we cannot talk to
the police. Do you understand?

18:24.061 --> 18:25.894
(Josie scoffs)

18:25.896 --> 18:27.295
(door slams on video)

18:27.297 --> 18:29.431
Guess your friend's
involved after all.

18:29.433 --> 18:31.433
Anymore footage
like this, Sebastian?

18:31.435 --> 18:35.036
I don't know. Patton's scanning
the rest of the feed right now.

18:35.038 --> 18:37.272
Let me know if you
find anything else.

18:38.775 --> 18:40.375
I'll talk to Felix.

18:40.377 --> 18:42.243
Want someone to go with you?

18:42.245 --> 18:43.611
No.

18:53.156 --> 18:55.290
(sighs)

18:55.292 --> 18:56.624
(car alarm chirps)

18:56.626 --> 18:59.060
Felix, hey.

18:59.062 --> 19:01.763
Need to talk to you.

19:01.765 --> 19:02.964
No time tonight, Dwayne.

19:02.966 --> 19:04.032
Maybe tomorrow.
It's either out here

19:04.034 --> 19:05.967
or back at NCIS
in cuffs.

19:05.969 --> 19:08.103
(scoffs) Stop playing.
I'm not playing.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.204
You lied to me today.

19:09.206 --> 19:11.806
You absolutely saw Theo
the night he died.

19:11.808 --> 19:13.241
You argued with him.

19:13.243 --> 19:14.342
You need to mind
your own business.

19:14.344 --> 19:15.844
This is my
business, Felix.

19:15.846 --> 19:17.479
A sailor was murdered
outside your club,

19:17.481 --> 19:20.014
and every piece of evidence
leads straight to you.

19:22.018 --> 19:24.252
You think I killed Theo?

19:24.254 --> 19:25.553
He was like my own son.

19:25.555 --> 19:26.821
Then explain it to me.

19:26.823 --> 19:28.923
Why was he gathering
evidence of drugs

19:28.925 --> 19:30.158
being purchased in your club?

19:30.160 --> 19:31.459
Why was he surveilling
your office?

19:31.461 --> 19:33.528
Why was he killed?
You don't understand.

19:33.530 --> 19:34.696
Try me.

19:36.933 --> 19:38.666
I told him to
stay out of it.

19:38.668 --> 19:41.336
He was always so protective.

19:41.338 --> 19:43.972
I told him
he'd get hurt,

19:43.974 --> 19:46.307
but he wouldn't listen.

19:48.311 --> 19:49.544
I can't say anymore.

19:49.546 --> 19:52.147
I'm trying very hard

19:52.149 --> 19:55.550
to not believe you're running
drugs out of Delilah's,

19:55.552 --> 19:57.419
but right now,
I'm the only one.

19:57.421 --> 20:00.188
Rest of my team is ready
to take you down.

20:00.190 --> 20:02.023
Why on Earth won't you talk?

20:02.025 --> 20:04.893
Because somebody else
is gonna get killed.

20:04.895 --> 20:06.694
If someone's
threatening you, Felix,

20:06.696 --> 20:09.998
threatening Josie, I can help.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.133
Yeah, that's what Theo said.

20:12.135 --> 20:13.668
And you see
what happened to him.

20:13.670 --> 20:16.037
Now, if you're
not gonna arrest me,

20:16.039 --> 20:18.339
I'm going inside
my damn house.

20:18.341 --> 20:20.575
Then I guess I'm
gonna arrest you. (rapid beeping)

20:24.781 --> 20:26.981
(car alarm blaring)

20:49.360 --> 20:51.561
(indistinct radio chatter)

20:55.800 --> 20:57.133
Pride,

20:57.135 --> 20:59.035
you sure you don't want
to go to the hospital?

20:59.037 --> 21:00.236
No, no. All cuts and bruises.

21:00.238 --> 21:02.438
Felix took the worst
of the blast.

21:02.440 --> 21:03.773
Thanks, Eugene.
No problem.

21:03.775 --> 21:05.041
Any word on him?

21:05.043 --> 21:08.144
I called the hospital.
He's in surgery, but okay.

21:08.146 --> 21:10.046
All right, have them
post a guard.

21:10.048 --> 21:12.615
Whoever did this might try
and come back to finish the job.

21:12.617 --> 21:14.784
It's probably the same person
that killed Theo.

21:14.786 --> 21:16.986
Look, he didn't say anything
before the bomb went off?

21:16.988 --> 21:19.655
Not much, just that
he was being threatened.

21:19.657 --> 21:21.858
Probably by whoever was
selling drugs at the club.

21:21.860 --> 21:24.026
Theo tried to help.
So Felix was scared.

21:24.028 --> 21:25.328
SEBASTIAN: Yeah,
with good reason, too.

21:25.330 --> 21:27.530
Come check this out.

21:27.532 --> 21:29.132
So the suspect

21:29.134 --> 21:30.867
tried to make it
look like an accident,

21:30.869 --> 21:32.435
created a gas leak in the house.

21:32.437 --> 21:33.569
He attached a remote detonator

21:33.571 --> 21:35.505
to the electrical
outlet right there.

21:35.507 --> 21:37.607
Which Felix triggered
when he opened the door.

21:37.609 --> 21:38.813
Yeah. If you hadn't pulled him
away from the entrance,

21:38.814 --> 21:41.344
he would've burned to a crisp.
Remote transmitter, right?

21:41.346 --> 21:43.613
SEBASTIAN: Yeah, uses an RF
signal to trigger the spark.

21:43.615 --> 21:45.148
It's simple, but effective.

21:45.150 --> 21:46.482
Mean something to you, Sonja?

21:46.484 --> 21:49.685
Dixie Mafia uses firebombs
like that to take out enemies.

21:49.687 --> 21:52.321
I thought those guys
were out of commission?

21:52.323 --> 21:53.923
Most of the leadership's
behind bars.

21:53.925 --> 21:55.424
There's plenty of soldiers
still operating.

21:55.426 --> 21:58.027
And drugs are their
main business.

21:58.029 --> 22:00.096
All right,
Sebastian and I'll head back.

22:00.098 --> 22:01.898
Start looking
into any connection

22:01.900 --> 22:04.066
between Delilah's
and the Dixie Mafia.

22:04.068 --> 22:05.268
You two go to
the hospital.

22:05.270 --> 22:07.203
Josie should probably
be there by now.

22:07.205 --> 22:09.105
See what she can tell us.
GREGORIO: Pride.

22:09.107 --> 22:10.573
What?

22:10.575 --> 22:12.542
We'll find whoever
did this to your friend.

22:12.544 --> 22:15.478
Yeah. We'd better.

22:23.321 --> 22:25.354
(sighs)
You got to be kidding.

22:25.356 --> 22:27.256
Not as bad as it looks.

22:27.258 --> 22:29.292
That's the same thing
you said about my arm

22:29.294 --> 22:32.395
when I feel off that horse
at Joey Tanner's birthday party.

22:32.397 --> 22:35.231
In my defense,
I was 12,

22:35.233 --> 22:37.633
and I'd never seen
a broken arm before.

22:37.635 --> 22:40.903
(sighs) What do I know about
running a business, Rachel?

22:40.905 --> 22:44.807
Right, spreadsheets, accounting,
balancing the books...

22:44.809 --> 22:47.777
Those are all pretty
much the same thing.

22:47.779 --> 22:50.646
But that's why I'm here.
I'll help you.

22:50.648 --> 22:53.149
Every step of the way.

22:53.151 --> 22:57.153
And look,
I know it's a lot.

22:57.155 --> 22:59.055
You need to take
your time.

22:59.057 --> 23:00.323
Mourn your dad.

23:00.325 --> 23:03.426
Get your head around
all this.

23:03.428 --> 23:06.896
Ah, what was he thinking?

23:08.132 --> 23:10.233
He knew I didn't want
any part of this.

23:10.235 --> 23:12.468
He also knew that the
business in your family

23:12.470 --> 23:14.337
needs to be taken care of.

23:14.339 --> 23:17.006
This was just like him,
you know.

23:17.008 --> 23:21.143
Determined to get his way,
no matter what.

23:21.145 --> 23:23.379
That's one way
of looking at it.

23:23.381 --> 23:26.048
Look, Beau chose you

23:26.050 --> 23:27.950
because he knew you'd handle it.

23:27.952 --> 23:31.687
He believed in you...
and trusted you'd do right.

23:31.689 --> 23:35.925
If that's how he really felt,
he... never told me.

23:35.927 --> 23:38.027
All right,

23:38.029 --> 23:40.763
I guess I can stick around
for a couple extra days,

23:40.765 --> 23:43.065
sort this all out.

23:43.067 --> 23:45.501
Christopher...
this isn't

23:45.503 --> 23:48.037
a "couple of days"
situation.

23:48.039 --> 23:49.438
It's a full-time job.

23:49.440 --> 23:51.841
You own the company.

23:51.843 --> 23:54.977
300 employees waiting
on your word.

23:54.979 --> 23:57.346
You need to move back home,

23:57.348 --> 23:59.015
to Alabama.
(scoffs)

23:59.017 --> 24:00.917
What are you talking about?

24:00.919 --> 24:01.951
For a little while, at least.

24:01.953 --> 24:03.019
(phone rings)
Six months.

24:03.021 --> 24:04.787
Maybe a year.

24:04.789 --> 24:05.922
Hold on.

24:05.924 --> 24:08.391
Percy, what's up?

24:08.393 --> 24:10.860
SONJA: Don't freak out.
Pride's been hurt.

24:10.862 --> 24:12.361
What?

24:12.363 --> 24:14.297
(playing blues melody)

24:14.299 --> 24:17.266
♪ ♪

24:28.012 --> 24:29.412
Josie.

24:29.414 --> 24:31.414
I'm Special Agent Gregorio.

24:31.416 --> 24:34.417
I work with Dwayne Pride.
How's your dad doing?

24:34.419 --> 24:37.219
Um, yeah,
his surgery went well.

24:37.221 --> 24:39.722
Doctors say he won't be
awake for a few hours, so...

24:39.724 --> 24:41.390
Good, good, good.
How are you?

24:41.392 --> 24:43.559
You must be kind
of scared, huh?

24:43.561 --> 24:46.395
It doesn't seem real.
Yeah.

24:46.397 --> 24:50.266
First Theo, and now...
this.

24:51.669 --> 24:54.470
This must bring up a lot of
questions for you, huh?

24:54.472 --> 24:56.105
Like, who'd want to
do this to them?

24:56.107 --> 24:58.541
Or what were they
involved in?

24:58.543 --> 25:02.244
They weren't involved
in anything.

25:02.246 --> 25:04.313
Someone's running drugs
through your club.

25:04.315 --> 25:06.615
Theo knew, your dad knows,

25:06.617 --> 25:08.084
and you should know it, too.

25:08.086 --> 25:10.152
You're accusing my father
of dealing drugs?

25:10.154 --> 25:12.088
No, but he got
caught in the middle.

25:12.090 --> 25:13.356
What do you want from me?

25:13.358 --> 25:15.291
Information.
I don't know anything.

25:15.293 --> 25:17.259
Ah, see, I don't know
if that's true.

25:17.261 --> 25:18.427
I think you do know
what's happening,

25:18.429 --> 25:19.762
and you want to
talk about it,

25:19.764 --> 25:20.763
you're just afraid to.

25:20.765 --> 25:22.198
NEIL: Josie.
Am I right?

25:23.468 --> 25:24.667
Hey.

25:24.669 --> 25:27.436
Can you excuse us
for a minute?

25:27.438 --> 25:28.904
We're in the middle
of a conversation.

25:28.906 --> 25:30.773
Is that what you want, Josie?

25:30.775 --> 25:32.441
For me to leave?

25:32.443 --> 25:35.211
Um, I think I need
to get some air.

25:35.213 --> 25:36.479
So, no.

25:36.481 --> 25:39.015
NEIL: Well, then,
let's get out of here.

25:39.017 --> 25:40.783
You heard her.

25:45.356 --> 25:47.189
What's up?
You look concerned.

25:47.191 --> 25:48.791
I'm just wondering why
all the men in Josie's life

25:48.793 --> 25:50.359
keep stopping her
from talking.

25:50.361 --> 25:51.994
Who is this guy she's with,
anyway?

25:51.996 --> 25:54.196
Neil Clydell, Felix's
partner at the club.

25:54.198 --> 25:55.664
Yeah, I don't like him.

25:55.666 --> 25:58.334
Well, we checked him out.
No record. He's a citizen.

25:58.336 --> 26:00.069
Then we need to dig deeper,
and we need access

26:00.071 --> 26:01.237
to Josie's phone.

26:01.239 --> 26:03.139
Wait, you think
he's dangerous?

26:03.141 --> 26:05.674
I think we need to
keep an eye on them,

26:05.676 --> 26:07.710
just to be sure.

26:07.712 --> 26:09.745
So, Neil Clydell has been
running music clubs

26:09.747 --> 26:12.181
his entire adult life.
No legal trouble that we found.

26:12.183 --> 26:13.682
But he does have
an interesting résumé.

26:13.684 --> 26:15.551
Right, so the last two clubs
that Neil ran--

26:15.553 --> 26:17.720
one in Biloxi,
the other in Nashville--

26:17.722 --> 26:19.455
they both burned down
after police

26:19.457 --> 26:21.023
started drug investigations.

26:21.025 --> 26:22.892
Owners died in the fires, too.

26:22.894 --> 26:24.360
That's more than
coincidence.

26:24.362 --> 26:26.062
PATTON:
It's genetics.

26:26.064 --> 26:27.596
Neil's father and grandfather
were lieutenants

26:27.598 --> 26:30.166
in the Dixie Mafia,
till they went to prison.

26:30.168 --> 26:31.500
Yeah, we're thinking that
Neil's a front man,

26:31.502 --> 26:32.768
handling the legitimate business

26:32.770 --> 26:33.969
while someone else
does the dirty work.

26:33.971 --> 26:35.504
Any idea who that might be?

26:35.506 --> 26:36.705
No, I'm running
background checks

26:36.707 --> 26:38.140
on Delilah's employees
right now.

26:38.142 --> 26:39.875
Gregorio had me hack
into Josie's phone--

26:39.877 --> 26:41.110
she did a lot of texting

26:41.112 --> 26:42.645
with Neil today.

26:42.647 --> 26:44.647
Mostly demanding to know
what the hell is going on.

26:44.649 --> 26:46.582
Josie's been dating Neil,
probably trusts him.

26:46.584 --> 26:47.817
What was his response?

26:47.819 --> 26:50.186
To meet Josie at the hospital
and drive her away.

26:50.188 --> 26:51.320
Percy and Gregorio
did follow them

26:51.322 --> 26:52.354
to his house in Lakeview.

26:52.356 --> 26:55.224
They need to get Josie out now.

26:58.729 --> 27:00.062
GREGORIO: They got here
about 20 minutes ago.

27:00.064 --> 27:01.330
They've been inside
ever since.

27:01.332 --> 27:02.498
PRIDE:
Get in there and arrest him.

27:02.500 --> 27:03.766
Yeah, understood.

27:03.768 --> 27:05.401
PRIDE: Be careful.
Okay.

27:05.403 --> 27:07.536
Clydell's Dixie Mafia.
We're gonna bring him in.

27:11.209 --> 27:13.776
(gunshots)
GREGORIO: Oh, my God,

27:13.778 --> 27:14.977
Josie!

27:20.618 --> 27:21.951
Federal agents!

27:22.954 --> 27:25.054
Percy!

27:27.425 --> 27:28.724
He's dead.

27:29.627 --> 27:32.128
But where's Josie?

27:45.690 --> 27:48.157
All right.
GREGORIO: He's been shot twice in the chest

27:48.159 --> 27:50.293
and we can't find Josie.
Okay.

27:52.297 --> 27:53.763
Neil Clydell was
shot twice in the chest,

27:53.765 --> 27:56.132
and there's no sign
of Josie anywhere.

27:56.134 --> 27:58.367
You thin she went
<i>Kill Bill</i> on him?

27:58.369 --> 28:00.002
Got revenge for her father?

28:00.004 --> 28:01.537
She's a singer,
not a killer.

28:01.539 --> 28:02.936
Well, I don't know,
sometimes people snap.

28:02.938 --> 28:04.975
Not this time.
Gregorio said there were

28:04.976 --> 28:07.543
signs of a struggle
after Neil was killed.

28:07.545 --> 28:09.378
Someone dragged
out the back door,

28:09.380 --> 28:10.980
and Josie's phone
ditched in the yard.

28:10.982 --> 28:12.515
Okay, so there was
a third person in the house.

28:12.517 --> 28:13.649
Yeah, and we need to find him.
(phone chimes)

28:13.651 --> 28:16.419
And we need to find Josie.

28:16.421 --> 28:17.920
Well, Gregorio's about
to send me some prints

28:17.922 --> 28:19.422
that she found inside the
house-- I can run those.

28:19.424 --> 28:22.325
Good.
What can I do to help?

28:23.628 --> 28:24.760
Christopher, what...

28:24.762 --> 28:26.495
Percy told me about the bomb.

28:26.497 --> 28:27.663
Are you all right?

28:27.665 --> 28:29.432
I'm fine. Fine.

28:29.434 --> 28:30.900
You-you should be home.

28:30.902 --> 28:33.636
I'm more useful here.

28:35.106 --> 28:37.440
Get me an I.D. on the
third person in that house.

28:37.442 --> 28:39.976
I'm on it. You good?

28:39.978 --> 28:41.477
Yeah, thanks.

28:41.479 --> 28:43.346
PRIDE:
Come on.

28:50.922 --> 28:52.188
What's going on, Chris?

28:52.190 --> 28:53.956
Well, like I said,
I heard about the bomb,

28:53.958 --> 28:56.792
thought you might need
some help, so here I am.

28:56.794 --> 28:59.729
I have plenty
of help on the case.

29:01.499 --> 29:04.233
And you got something else
on your mind right now.

29:04.235 --> 29:05.635
It wont distract me
from work,

29:05.637 --> 29:07.036
if that's what
you're worried about.

29:07.038 --> 29:08.638
I'm more worried about
the work distracting you

29:08.640 --> 29:09.839
from what's going on
back home.

29:09.841 --> 29:12.575
I'm good.
You're anything but.

29:14.879 --> 29:18.848
You want to be here
right now...

29:18.850 --> 29:21.017
you need to tell me
what's going on.

29:27.125 --> 29:29.358
My dad knew he was sick, King.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.394
All right,

29:31.396 --> 29:33.896
when he was here, he looked me
straight in the eye,

29:33.898 --> 29:38.901
and he knew he was dying...
and didn't say a word about it.

29:40.305 --> 29:41.504
That's a lot to deal with.

29:41.506 --> 29:43.906
He named me
executor of the estate,

29:43.908 --> 29:45.708
gave me control
of the company--

29:45.710 --> 29:47.643
everything he knew
I didn't want.

29:47.645 --> 29:50.913
Your father was
a complicated man.

29:50.915 --> 29:53.783
But he also believed in you.

29:54.652 --> 29:56.819
He could have said it.

29:56.821 --> 30:00.623
At least once.
You know, out loud.

30:00.625 --> 30:03.292
I think this was his way
of saying it.

30:05.930 --> 30:08.898
I can't do it.

30:08.900 --> 30:11.901
All right, I can't
take it all on, but...

30:12.837 --> 30:15.771
...somehow I feel like
I don't have a choice.

30:15.773 --> 30:18.407
It's your family.

30:20.044 --> 30:23.612
This is my family, too.

30:23.614 --> 30:25.047
My home.

30:25.049 --> 30:28.451
What am I supposed to do?

30:31.022 --> 30:33.089
You're the only person
who can figure that out.

30:33.091 --> 30:34.557
I know it's a lot.

30:34.559 --> 30:36.125
I know you're wondering
what the hell

30:36.127 --> 30:39.528
your father was thinking,
but he... trusted you

30:39.530 --> 30:41.797
to handle this.

30:41.799 --> 30:44.066
And that's what
you're gonna do.

30:44.068 --> 30:46.402
(scoffs)

30:46.404 --> 30:47.870
That easy, huh?

30:47.872 --> 30:50.473
Nah, nothing easy about it.

30:50.475 --> 30:51.941
SEBASTIAN:
Pride.

30:53.144 --> 30:55.644
I got something.

31:02.453 --> 31:03.953
So, Percy and Gregorio
found those fingerprints

31:03.955 --> 31:05.354
in a living room closet

31:05.356 --> 31:06.856
in Neil Clydell's house.

31:06.858 --> 31:10.893
They match a Dixie Mafia
member named Sam Chambers.

31:10.895 --> 31:12.261
Supposed to mean
something to me?

31:12.263 --> 31:14.196
No, because Chambers changed
his name to Jansen

31:14.198 --> 31:15.464
six months ago,

31:15.466 --> 31:17.133
right before he got
a job as a bartender

31:17.135 --> 31:18.768
at Delilah's.
LASALLE: I questioned him

31:18.770 --> 31:21.570
at the club the other day.

31:21.572 --> 31:23.773
His prints were on
the inside of the closet.

31:23.775 --> 31:26.809
Suggesting he was
laying in wait.

31:26.811 --> 31:28.978
Why would he kill Neil?

31:28.980 --> 31:31.080
Well, Neil and Josie were
in a relationship.

31:31.082 --> 31:34.183
- - Maybe Sam questioned his loyalty.
Tying up loose ends.

31:34.185 --> 31:35.618
But why not shoot Josie, too?

31:35.620 --> 31:38.954
He's got other plans for her.
PRIDE: Wha...?

31:38.956 --> 31:40.656
What is it, Sebastian?

31:40.658 --> 31:42.425
Those two clubs that Clydell ran
that burned down,

31:42.427 --> 31:43.959
where the owners died
in both cases?

31:43.961 --> 31:45.461
They were made to look like

31:45.463 --> 31:46.729
they started the fires.

31:46.731 --> 31:48.097
A frame-up job.

31:48.099 --> 31:49.899
And Chambers has
a history of arson

31:49.901 --> 31:51.434
and explosives
on his rap sheet.

31:51.436 --> 31:52.868
PATTON: Pride.
Motion-activated camera

31:52.870 --> 31:56.005

31:59.043 --> 32:01.343

get there now.

Okay.

You get the employees out.
I'll go after Josie.

32:24.402 --> 32:26.168
I need everyone
to clear this building.

32:26.170 --> 32:29.338
