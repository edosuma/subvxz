WEBVTT

00:06.409 --> 00:09.162
- Good morning.
- Hey, Pheebs.

00:09.329 --> 00:10.887
Did you get the postcard from Dan?

00:11.969 --> 00:15.041
Yeah, it sounds like
he's having a great time.

00:15.209 --> 00:17.359
What's the matter,
is something wrong?

00:17.529 --> 00:19.838
I got another letter
from Dr Williamson.

00:20.609 --> 00:24.522
Williamson? Wasn't he the specialist
that treated you for Oroya fever?

00:24.849 --> 00:26.601
That would be him.

00:26.769 --> 00:28.248
That was months ago.
What does he want?

00:28.689 --> 00:32.398
He wants me to come in for blood work
so he can make sure I'm cured.

00:32.609 --> 00:35.840
An angel brought you back to life.
Trust me, you're cured.

00:36.049 --> 00:37.880
I know, but I can't exactly
tell him that.

00:38.489 --> 00:43.438
- So just throw the letter away.
- I have been. He keeps sending more.

00:43.609 --> 00:46.077
Here's my granola.
What's it doing in the trash?

00:46.289 --> 00:47.642
I just bought this two days ago.

00:47.849 --> 00:52.081
- Who eats this besides me?
- Leo. But I'll replace it, I promise.

00:55.289 --> 01:00.079
Piper, I don't want you to think
I mind, because I don't.

01:01.169 --> 01:05.799
But if Leo's gonna be
living here, then I...

01:06.009 --> 01:08.967
I think we should probably set
some ground rules, you know?

01:09.129 --> 01:10.608
Leo doesn't live here.

01:10.969 --> 01:12.448
He eats breakfast here.

01:13.969 --> 01:16.358
- A lot.
- Maybe he just likes cereal.

01:18.769 --> 01:20.282
You really think he's here that much?

01:20.489 --> 01:22.320
He's like the big brother
I never wanted.

01:24.569 --> 01:27.367
I mean, had.

01:27.569 --> 01:30.208
Morning. Pheebs...

01:30.369 --> 01:33.122
...Evan Stone, ever hear of him?
- Hello.

01:34.129 --> 01:36.518
Red Death? I've only seen that movie,
like, five times.

01:36.689 --> 01:39.920
Yes, I know. I'm doing a photo shoot
with him today.

01:40.089 --> 01:41.363
How much do I hate you right now?

01:42.009 --> 01:45.046
Unless the tabloid rumours are true,
in which case, I really hate you.

01:45.209 --> 01:46.801
He is supposed to be...

01:47.289 --> 01:48.802
I do not wanna know
anything about him,

01:48.969 --> 01:50.482
I just wanna take his picture
and leave.

01:50.649 --> 01:52.207
And I need to go get ready.

01:53.129 --> 01:57.122
Prue, you don't think
Leo lives here, do you?

01:57.289 --> 02:00.440
I mean, yeah, of course he does,
but, I mean, it's fine. It's...

02:01.009 --> 02:03.159
As long as you're happy,
that's all I really care about.

02:03.329 --> 02:08.244
Not that I was unhappy when I saw
Leo all naked in the shower

02:08.408 --> 02:10.400
and just all... wet.

02:10.609 --> 02:13.442
Okay, so you guys just need
to make up some ground rules,

02:13.649 --> 02:16.083
you know, what's acceptable
and not acceptable,

02:16.249 --> 02:19.207
and... I'm serious.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:31.529 --> 02:34.168
Of course I got your memo.
You can't be serious.

02:34.369 --> 02:35.358
Have you read my report?

02:36.729 --> 02:39.163
Ninety days ago, Piper Halliwell
was admitted with Oroya fever.

02:39.329 --> 02:41.479
Within 24 hours,
she was completely free of the virus,

02:41.649 --> 02:43.605
though she failed to respond
to any of the treatments.

02:43.809 --> 02:46.084
Dr Williamson, I may be new
to San Francisco Memorial,

02:46.249 --> 02:48.319
but I am very aware of your project.

02:48.529 --> 02:50.520
Then you're also aware of the fact
that her recovery

02:50.689 --> 02:52.327
- makes no clinical sense.
- True.

02:52.489 --> 02:55.845
But your subsequent tests failed
to reveal anything out of the ordinary.

02:56.049 --> 02:58.609
Look, I just need more time.
I've only injected the primates

02:58.769 --> 03:00.760
with samples of
the Halliwells' blood this morning.

03:01.169 --> 03:03.364
Piper Halliwell is fine.

03:03.569 --> 03:06.367
I want you to forget about her and
concentrate on people who are sick.

03:06.569 --> 03:08.764
I am. Somewhere in this blood
could be the key

03:08.929 --> 03:10.521
to unlocking a universal antibody.

03:10.729 --> 03:13.482
And if I agreed with you, we wouldn't
be having this conversation.

03:13.689 --> 03:15.964
- You will not terminate this project.
- Dr Williamson,

03:16.129 --> 03:17.960
I believe I already have.

03:22.409 --> 03:24.206
I am not giving up.

03:57.649 --> 04:00.322
All right, Prue.
Let's see how this affects you.

05:45.889 --> 05:47.163
I said, be quiet!

05:58.849 --> 06:02.159
- I have some time between appoint...
- Wait.

06:03.689 --> 06:05.042
Dr Jeffries?

06:10.289 --> 06:12.325
So I thought we might discuss...

06:12.489 --> 06:14.400
How did you get over there?

06:16.409 --> 06:19.765
- What happened in here?
- I had an accident.

06:19.929 --> 06:22.602
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

06:22.809 --> 06:25.960
- What happened to your neck?
- Nothing.

06:26.129 --> 06:28.404
Listen, I need to get ahold
of the Halliwells immediately.

06:28.609 --> 06:31.123
I told you that project's
been terminated.

06:31.329 --> 06:34.401
Maybe you should take some time off.
You've been under a lot of pressure.

06:34.609 --> 06:36.361
And I understand
your sister's been sick.

06:36.529 --> 06:39.089
And I told you I need to get ahold
of the Halliwells immediately.

06:42.249 --> 06:44.888
I want you cleared out of this lab
by the end of the day.

07:02.329 --> 07:04.524
Get the PA to do it.

07:10.449 --> 07:13.168
- Can you give me a hand with this?
- All right.

07:14.369 --> 07:18.282
Tell him to get back here, all right?
I'm tired of waiting.

07:23.409 --> 07:26.162
- Evan Stone?
- Yes?

07:26.369 --> 07:28.599
Hi, I think we have a date.

07:29.609 --> 07:33.648
I'm Prue Halliwell, 415 Magazine.

07:33.809 --> 07:36.528
Ring security. I think I found
another tabloid photographer.

07:36.689 --> 07:40.682
Me? No, I am not with a tabloid.

07:40.889 --> 07:43.483
I'm with 415.

07:43.689 --> 07:45.008
- I have an appointment.
- Sorry.

07:45.169 --> 07:47.080
We've had photographers
sneaking in here all week.

07:47.289 --> 07:50.440
That's why I'm here.
I'm Lucy, Evan's publicist.

07:51.729 --> 07:54.402
And this is a temporary ID.

07:54.569 --> 07:56.480
- This could be a problem.
- Yeah, that's because

07:56.649 --> 07:59.004
I'm a new employee of the magazine.
You can call Gil Corso,

07:59.209 --> 08:00.801
I'm sure he'd be happy to confirm it.

08:01.009 --> 08:02.727
I'll keep an eye on her
while you do that.

08:04.329 --> 08:05.842
Okay?

08:08.169 --> 08:11.286
So, what happens if Mr Corso
is in a meeting?

08:11.449 --> 08:14.043
What, you send me flying
with a tenchi nage kick?

08:14.249 --> 08:16.319
I have an earth throw.
You know aikido.

08:16.849 --> 08:19.647
Yeah, well, it comes in...

08:19.969 --> 08:21.800
...handy with my line of work.

08:22.009 --> 08:24.204
The photography business
must be rougher than I thought.

08:25.009 --> 08:28.206
Only when publicists
don't trust temporary IDs.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.561
Lucy's a really cool person.

08:30.729 --> 08:33.687
Newly promoted, just struggling
to control her new power, that's all.

08:34.249 --> 08:36.524
Yeah, I can certainly relate to that.

08:49.409 --> 08:51.923
Ever done it on a cloud?

08:52.089 --> 08:53.681
I don't know,
does a feather bed count?

08:53.849 --> 08:57.285
- Phoebe. I thought you were Piper.
- Well, it is her room.

08:57.449 --> 09:00.088
- I am so sorry.
- No. No worries.

09:00.249 --> 09:02.843
I mean, it could happen to anyone,
especially someone

09:03.009 --> 09:05.603
that doesn't have to knock
to come in, you know?

09:06.049 --> 09:08.927
You're so right.
But this will never happen again.

09:09.089 --> 09:11.444
- You have my word.
- Okay. And you have my word

09:11.609 --> 09:13.361
that I won't tell Piper.

09:14.169 --> 09:16.399
Good idea.

09:16.849 --> 09:19.761
I'm just leaving now.

09:20.929 --> 09:22.760
- She's in the kitchen.
- Thanks.

09:32.889 --> 09:35.278
Item number two:

09:35.449 --> 09:38.521
Orbing in unannounced.

09:40.009 --> 09:41.567
You're calling me at home?

09:41.729 --> 09:44.766
Yes, Ms Halliwell. I need you to meet
me at my lab as soon as possible.

09:44.929 --> 09:47.045
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Look, you don't understand.

09:47.209 --> 09:49.279
- This is very important.
- Goodbye, doctor.

09:49.569 --> 09:51.241
Look, I need your...

10:03.009 --> 10:04.681
Piper?

10:05.249 --> 10:07.319
Leo, hi.

10:07.489 --> 10:10.049
- Everything okay?
- I don't know.

10:10.209 --> 10:12.484
That was Dr Williamson.
He's been sending me letters,

10:12.649 --> 10:15.209
trying to get me back to the hospital
for follow-up tests.

10:15.369 --> 10:17.564
And I'm not going.

10:17.729 --> 10:20.448
What are you doing here? Don't tell
me there's a demon running around.

10:20.609 --> 10:23.567
No. I just figured
since it was your day off,

10:23.729 --> 10:26.118
maybe you could spend it with me.

10:27.609 --> 10:30.919
- Did you, now?
- Yes, I did.

10:32.729 --> 10:36.927
- You sure you're all right?
- Yeah.

10:37.089 --> 10:38.920
I mean, it's not like
he's ever gonna figure out

10:39.089 --> 10:41.728
that you were the one who saved me,
so I'm not gonna worry about it

10:41.889 --> 10:44.039
because there's nothing
to worry about.

10:47.809 --> 10:49.561
- Ms Halliwell?
- No, this is Nurse Jordan,

10:49.729 --> 10:52.368
your sister's nurse.
I was wondering if you could...

10:53.009 --> 10:55.079
- Is she okay?
- You need to get to your sister's room

10:55.249 --> 10:58.764
- as soon as possible.
- I'll be right there.

11:13.889 --> 11:17.848
Can you just lift your chin a little bit?
Because there's a shadow.

11:18.569 --> 11:20.082
Thanks.

11:29.569 --> 11:31.764
- What a cute monkey.
- Monkey?

11:31.969 --> 11:33.960
Yeah, he's right behind you.

11:36.089 --> 11:38.205
What are you talking about?

11:39.489 --> 11:41.207
Okay, thanks.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.877
- You're leaving?
- Yeah, I'm finished.

11:44.089 --> 11:47.126
- We just got started.
- Right, and...

11:47.289 --> 11:49.484
...I got a great shot,
it was perfect.

11:55.249 --> 11:56.921
Ms Halliwell.

11:59.129 --> 12:00.767
Your car keys.

12:12.889 --> 12:15.528
You can shoot my picture
anytime, Ms Halliwell.

12:15.689 --> 12:17.566
Thank you.

12:23.009 --> 12:25.728
Hey, you are never going to believe
what happened today.

12:25.889 --> 12:28.119
Yes, I will. I saw Notting Hill.

12:28.489 --> 12:30.480
What are you talking about?

12:31.489 --> 12:33.605
They're from Evan.

12:33.769 --> 12:37.159
I hope you're happy.
You're stealing away my dream man.

12:37.329 --> 12:41.004
"Prue, what really happened? Evan."

12:41.209 --> 12:43.848
- Something happened?
- Yes, but not with Evan Stone.

12:44.009 --> 12:44.998
Is Piper here?

12:45.209 --> 12:47.325
Yeah, she's in the living room
with Leo, again.

12:47.489 --> 12:50.367
Piper, Leo.

12:50.529 --> 12:52.440
So are you gonna tell me
why he sent you flowers?

12:52.609 --> 12:54.645
You know, I just have no idea.

12:55.529 --> 12:57.997
And they say the youngest
is the most naive.

12:59.289 --> 13:02.361
- Prue, you're back early.
- Yes, I am.

13:02.569 --> 13:07.643
That's because a monkey
astral-projected to me on the set today.

13:07.849 --> 13:09.441
A monkey?

13:10.569 --> 13:14.448
- Astral-projected?
- Yeah, and it waved at me, okay?

13:14.609 --> 13:16.998
Like it knew me or something.
I think it wanted my help.

13:17.209 --> 13:19.882
Honey, I think you're working
way too hard.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.880
You know, Phoebe, I saw it.

13:23.049 --> 13:27.486
Okay, and it... And it had, like, an
ID bracelet from a hospital on its arm.

13:27.889 --> 13:31.518
Prue, honey, I don't think
monkeys can astral-project.

13:31.689 --> 13:34.920
- Can they?
- Not without powers.

13:35.089 --> 13:37.125
And it would have to have
your power too, you know,

13:37.289 --> 13:38.927
to find you, magic to magic.

13:39.129 --> 13:42.201
My power? How can it have
my power? I have my powers.

13:42.609 --> 13:46.204
All right, wait. So you're saying
that a monkey is sharing my powers?

13:46.889 --> 13:48.208
Is that even possible?

13:48.409 --> 13:50.525
After all you've seen and done
over the last two years?

13:50.689 --> 13:52.486
You tell me what's impossible.

13:53.609 --> 13:56.282
You said something
about a hospital wristband?

13:56.569 --> 13:59.083
Yeah, it had a rose on it.

14:05.449 --> 14:07.599
Did it look anything like this?

14:09.249 --> 14:12.400
Yeah, exactly like this.

14:12.609 --> 14:14.486
Wait, is this
the same Dr Williamson?

14:14.889 --> 14:17.278
Yeah, he's been
sending me requests for weeks,

14:17.449 --> 14:20.088
and he called this morning
and said he wanted to see me.

14:20.289 --> 14:22.359
- What?
- Wait, you didn't tell me he called you.

14:22.569 --> 14:25.402
Well, there was nothing to say.
I hung up on him.

14:27.009 --> 14:28.727
Do you think he found out
about our powers?

14:29.929 --> 14:31.885
B. O.S.

14:32.049 --> 14:34.688
B. O.S. Oh, Book of Shadows,
Book of Shadows.

14:40.689 --> 14:43.078
- They say it's important.
- Okay.

14:43.249 --> 14:45.479
- Come back soon.
- Okay.

14:53.849 --> 14:55.407
My wife is dying.

14:55.569 --> 14:57.446
She's 33rd on the wait list, Curtis.

14:57.609 --> 15:00.248
She's not gonna live long enough
to get a kidney.

15:00.409 --> 15:02.684
There's nothing I can do,
Larry. I'm sorry.

15:02.889 --> 15:05.483
No, no. Let me tell you
what's sorry, okay?

15:05.649 --> 15:09.403
Look, I come here every day,
and for every minute that I'm with her,

15:09.569 --> 15:14.085
some scumbag criminal is freed,
released on a technicality.

15:17.449 --> 15:19.599
Curtis, listen to me.
She is your sister.

15:19.809 --> 15:21.208
Isn't there anything you can do?

15:27.009 --> 15:28.522
Larry, wait.

15:34.129 --> 15:35.642
Oh, my God.

15:35.849 --> 15:37.202
Get the crash team, get a gurney.

15:37.369 --> 15:39.007
This man's gonna have
a heart attack.

15:40.049 --> 15:41.721
- I said, the crash team.
- Yes, sir.

15:44.449 --> 15:47.600
If anyone looks like
they're gonna collapse, it's you, not...

15:50.449 --> 15:52.087
Come on, let's go. Let's get in here.

15:52.249 --> 15:56.162
Get his leg. Got him? All right,
give me two cc of adrenaline.

15:56.329 --> 15:58.684
- How did you know?
- He's gone into full arrest.

15:58.889 --> 16:01.198
- Check his airway. Bag him.
- Is an IV started?

16:01.369 --> 16:03.246
- What's his pulse?
- 90/60, doctor.

16:03.449 --> 16:04.848
Let's start compressions.

16:05.009 --> 16:08.922
Listen, I'll save Edie too. I promise.

16:09.089 --> 16:11.125
- You gotta get it up.
- Give me that lidocaine.

16:14.089 --> 16:16.649
I need a list of all the criminals
who were admitted and released

16:16.809 --> 16:18.208
from the hospital jail ward.

16:18.369 --> 16:20.087
Now.

16:33.169 --> 16:35.558
Wow, what a mess.

16:37.329 --> 16:40.878
Well, too bad we can't ask them
where Williamson is.

16:41.489 --> 16:43.923
- That's the same monkey.
- It does look like it knows you.

16:47.969 --> 16:51.200
Okay, it looks like
they know all of us. Come on.

16:55.569 --> 16:58.481
He named them after us.

16:58.649 --> 17:00.685
That's really scary.

17:01.929 --> 17:04.079
All right, we need to
take a look around

17:04.249 --> 17:06.968
and make sure there's
nothing else here that could expose us.

17:08.169 --> 17:10.842
Well, maybe that's why the monkey
projected to you, Prue.

17:11.009 --> 17:12.646
Maybe she was trying to warn you.

17:15.368 --> 17:18.361
- All of these files say "Halliwell."
- Yeah, well, look at all these tests

17:18.529 --> 17:21.123
that he took. Okay, and not just
on blood that he took from you,

17:21.329 --> 17:23.080
but blood that he took
from Phoebe and me.

17:23.249 --> 17:24.840
He has spent months
trying to figure out

17:25.009 --> 17:26.964
how I survived the Oroya fever.

17:27.128 --> 17:29.962
Yeah, well, this grant request
says that he's searching

17:30.129 --> 17:32.802
for the universal antibody.

17:35.649 --> 17:37.367
Maybe he thought
it was in your blood.

17:43.929 --> 17:45.157
Piper, Phoebe.

17:48.649 --> 17:51.402
Okay, so I think it's safe to say
that Dr Williamson

17:51.569 --> 17:52.797
probably knows about us.

17:52.969 --> 17:56.325
Do you think he's been injecting
our blood into those monkeys?

17:56.489 --> 17:58.480
I don't know, but we need
to get them out of here

17:58.689 --> 18:00.919
before somebody walks in,
sees something flying,

18:01.089 --> 18:02.761
and everybody finds out about us.

18:18.289 --> 18:21.884
Okay, not only does Williamson
know about our powers,

18:22.049 --> 18:23.767
but he's got
one of them: Telekinesis.

18:24.129 --> 18:26.518
Wait a minute. You remember
what he was like when I was sick.

18:26.689 --> 18:29.408
He had the CDC here, the media.
If we don't stop him,

18:29.569 --> 18:31.878
the monkeys aren't gonna be
the only ones in cages.

18:41.369 --> 18:44.839
Well, it seems as though
you've stiffed me 30 hits.

18:45.009 --> 18:46.965
Oh, you know what?
Let me tell you something.

18:47.129 --> 18:49.689
I don't touch this stuff, all right?
I just sell it...

18:52.529 --> 18:53.518
You Benny Ritter?

18:54.129 --> 18:56.518
What are you doing?
That's my door, man.

19:01.249 --> 19:04.366
- What the hell is this?
- House call.

19:07.689 --> 19:10.078
Man, I gotta get up.

19:12.209 --> 19:14.120
No. No, no.

19:47.169 --> 19:49.285
- Okay, Piper, now.
- Wait.

19:52.049 --> 19:53.641
A Showbiz Tonight exclusive.

19:53.809 --> 19:56.198
Who is this mystery woman
in Evan Stone's life?

19:56.369 --> 19:59.759
Why did he send her flowers?
Tune in tonight and find out.

19:59.969 --> 20:01.641
I thought you said nothing happened.

20:01.809 --> 20:04.084
Yeah, he was just returning
my car keys.

20:04.249 --> 20:05.682
Hi. Hello, bigger problems.

20:06.049 --> 20:07.562
It was more than a miracle.

20:07.729 --> 20:10.482
It was as if he was clairvoyant.

20:11.289 --> 20:13.678
He said his brother-in-law
was going to have a heart attack,

20:13.849 --> 20:15.521
and ten seconds later, he collapsed.

20:15.849 --> 20:17.601
And he could tell that
just by looking at him?

20:17.769 --> 20:19.760
No, he touched him first.

20:19.929 --> 20:23.080
I'll take premonitions
for 500, Alex.

20:24.009 --> 20:27.240
Excuse me. I'm a patient
of Dr Williamson.

20:27.449 --> 20:29.883
- Do you know where I might find him?
- The records room.

20:30.089 --> 20:31.966
Okay, thank you.

20:32.169 --> 20:33.966
So he's using our powers in public.

20:34.129 --> 20:37.360
- At least he's not hurting anyone.
- Yet.

20:43.169 --> 20:45.160
Williamson's long gone.

20:45.329 --> 20:48.526
Wait, he came in here for a reason.

20:56.249 --> 20:58.683
It's a list of names and addresses
of people who were admitted

20:58.849 --> 21:00.487
into the jail ward in the hospital.

21:00.649 --> 21:02.002
Benny Ritter is highlighted.

21:11.209 --> 21:14.167
Accessed by Dr C. Williamson.

21:17.049 --> 21:18.960
I've taken care of everything.

21:19.129 --> 21:21.245
You're going to be okay.

21:21.409 --> 21:24.321
A lot of people are gonna be okay.

21:32.449 --> 21:34.599
Get my sister prepped and ready
for a kidney transplant.

21:34.969 --> 21:37.199
Tissue typing and cross matching
are confirmed.

21:37.409 --> 21:39.127
Unrelated living donor,
but an exact match.

21:39.329 --> 21:42.241
No questions. Do it. Now.

22:12.009 --> 22:14.569
Should I be afraid to ask what
you're doing in this part of town?

22:14.769 --> 22:16.600
We're not sure. What happened?

22:16.769 --> 22:19.727
Some lowlife named Benny Ritter
had a kidney removed.

22:20.129 --> 22:22.006
Not that he could tell us.
He was found sedated.

22:22.209 --> 22:24.165
- Who is he?
- Drug dealer.

22:24.329 --> 22:26.160
Busted last week,
out on a technicality.

22:26.689 --> 22:27.963
Any idea who did it?

22:28.169 --> 22:30.524
Med tech said whoever gutted him
stitched him up,

22:30.729 --> 22:35.086
left a note, something about internal
sutures secure, morphine for pain.

22:35.409 --> 22:37.525
- He left a note?
- Yeah, we'll definitely be looking

22:37.689 --> 22:40.078
- for somebody with medical training.
- You can't.

22:41.729 --> 22:44.118
I had a feeling you were gonna say
something like that.

22:44.289 --> 22:48.168
- Want to tell me why?
- Only that it's supernatural.

22:49.409 --> 22:51.081
I can't really tell them that.

22:51.409 --> 22:53.161
It's the best we can do
for now, Darryl.

22:53.649 --> 22:56.243
You're the one that said you didn't
wanna know what we were into.

22:56.449 --> 22:58.280
But I suppose you want me
to keep you posted?

22:58.489 --> 23:01.322
Yes, but more importantly,
just be careful.

23:05.609 --> 23:07.645
So much for not hurting anybody.

23:07.809 --> 23:10.721
Yeah, well, we have to find him
before the cops do.

23:13.409 --> 23:15.161
Piper.

23:15.329 --> 23:18.799
I keep thinking if I had
just answered one of his letters...

23:29.889 --> 23:33.802
Mr Corso, you know
that I am not Evan Stone's girlfriend.

23:35.649 --> 23:38.322
Are you laughing at me?

23:38.529 --> 23:40.485
Could somebody please help me?

23:41.849 --> 23:43.840
- Hi.
- There is nothing in here

23:44.009 --> 23:45.806
about mortals or animals
having powers,

23:46.009 --> 23:47.442
let alone how to get the powers
out of them.

23:47.649 --> 23:50.004
We will find something, Piper.

23:50.209 --> 23:54.361
Okay, when? Because Dr Williamson
has already stole someone's kidney,

23:54.529 --> 23:56.360
and what's gonna be next?

23:56.529 --> 24:00.363
I can explain everything,
just not now. Okay, bye.

24:00.569 --> 24:04.357
- Except for the magic monkey part?
- No, I thought I'd leave that part out.

24:06.089 --> 24:08.125
- What's that?
- Oh, my God.

24:08.289 --> 24:11.440
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
It's photographers.

24:13.129 --> 24:14.562
They're everywhere on the lawn.

24:14.769 --> 24:16.839
Okay, close the curtains.

24:17.049 --> 24:19.199
Okay. Hi.

24:19.409 --> 24:20.888
God.

24:21.369 --> 24:24.167
There are more coming.

24:24.369 --> 24:25.802
I'll be right there. More coming.

24:26.009 --> 24:28.682
- Do you think they saw anything?
- Yeah, like stolen monkeys.

24:29.689 --> 24:32.522
Who knows, but at least
they didn't see any magic.

24:35.449 --> 24:37.519
Never mind.

24:38.129 --> 24:39.881
Sorry.

24:41.049 --> 24:42.562
I'll ask later.

24:42.769 --> 24:46.603
Right now, I've got some bad news
about Dr Williamson.

24:46.809 --> 24:49.277
That's the press. They're after Prue.

24:54.089 --> 24:57.604
- Thanks.
- So, what's the bad news?

24:57.769 --> 25:00.363
Well, simply put...

25:00.689 --> 25:02.441
...Dr Williamson is cosmically screwed.

25:02.609 --> 25:05.043
He's got your powers
in his mortal body.

25:05.249 --> 25:07.365
And it took generations
to prepare you for that.

25:07.529 --> 25:09.440
You can handle it, he can't.

25:09.849 --> 25:13.603
- So, what's going to happen to him?
- He'll go mad.

25:14.769 --> 25:16.839
- Just from our powers?
- Yes.

25:17.049 --> 25:19.119
Wait, are you saying that our powers
are in our blood

25:19.289 --> 25:20.642
and he injected himself with it?

25:20.849 --> 25:23.079
That blood, yeah.

25:23.249 --> 25:26.446
You see, the spell that you cast
to cure Piper changed everything.

25:26.649 --> 25:29.288
And now it's changing
Dr Williamson.

25:29.489 --> 25:32.003
Your magic is meant for doing good,
but in the wrong person,

25:32.209 --> 25:33.722
somebody not ready for it,

25:33.929 --> 25:37.558
- that need to do good things...
- Could go bad?

25:37.849 --> 25:39.487
Real bad.

25:40.409 --> 25:43.685
Look, Piper, it's nobody's fault, all right?
Dr Williamson chose his own path.

25:44.209 --> 25:47.360
This is not a consequence
of anybody's actions except his own.

25:47.569 --> 25:50.447
Still, you have to find a way
to stop him before things get worse.

25:50.889 --> 25:53.278
If they haven't already.

25:55.969 --> 25:58.847
Okay, I'm gonna make a potion
to separate powers

25:59.049 --> 26:00.368
- from witches.
- They're monkeys.

26:00.569 --> 26:03.367
With witches' blood.
I don't know what else to do.

26:03.569 --> 26:06.242
And maybe if it works on them,
it'll work on Williamson.

26:06.449 --> 26:09.043
All right, I gotta figure out a way
to get rid of these reporters,

26:09.209 --> 26:12.804
otherwise we can't do anything and
figure out a way to go talk to Evan.

26:13.009 --> 26:14.601
I'm gonna go call Morris.

26:15.809 --> 26:17.242
He needs to know
what he's up against.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.764
If only to keep yourself
from being exposed as witches.

26:19.929 --> 26:22.966
- Yeah, that too.
- Piper, I'm gonna need your help.

26:30.929 --> 26:32.408
Thank you.

26:34.089 --> 26:35.363
You okay?

26:35.529 --> 26:38.407
Well, considering our powers have
combined to drive a man crazy

26:38.569 --> 26:41.481
and have put who knows
how many other people in danger...

26:43.969 --> 26:46.529
...l'm terrific.

26:55.089 --> 26:57.125
And cut.

26:57.289 --> 27:00.247
Terrific, guys, print that.

27:01.649 --> 27:05.562
Hi. Okay, I might hurt you.

27:05.729 --> 27:06.923
Evan.

27:07.249 --> 27:10.559
My front yard is filled
with photographers.

27:10.729 --> 27:12.321
Okay? They are watching
my every move.

27:12.529 --> 27:14.520
Come on. It'll blow over.

27:14.689 --> 27:16.281
You're a normal,
red-blooded American girl

27:16.449 --> 27:17.768
with nothing to hide, right?

27:17.929 --> 27:21.160
Right, but I can't really do my job

27:21.329 --> 27:24.048
with flashbulbs going off in my face
every single second.

27:24.249 --> 27:25.477
You can't fight back.

27:26.049 --> 27:27.880
That's like struggling in quicksand.

27:28.569 --> 27:30.560
Don't play.

27:30.729 --> 27:33.323
Whatever energy they're throwing
at you, just pass right on by.

27:33.529 --> 27:35.520
Because eventually
that energy comes back around,

27:36.329 --> 27:37.808
leads them to someone else.

27:38.849 --> 27:40.487
Yeah.

27:40.649 --> 27:44.722
Okay, I really appreciate
the whole "wax on, wax off" approach,

27:44.889 --> 27:47.357
but couldn't your people just issue
some kind of a statement?

27:47.569 --> 27:50.129
What, are you kidding me?
They're working the bad-boy image.

27:51.009 --> 27:52.681
Evan, please.

27:55.009 --> 27:57.443
You got a cell phone?

27:57.649 --> 27:59.287
Of course I do.

28:00.649 --> 28:02.401
- Who are you calling?
- Celebrity Peep Shows.

28:02.569 --> 28:05.925
They all use tipsters to tell them
what's going on, who's doing who.

28:06.809 --> 28:09.767
And I'm a tipster.
Code name: Julius.

28:10.889 --> 28:13.005
Hello, this is Julius.

28:13.169 --> 28:16.878
Evan Stone and his new girlfriend
are at the Bayview sound stage.

28:17.049 --> 28:18.448
They're going off to dinner.

28:18.649 --> 28:20.844
Hurry down there
if you want to catch them.

28:21.969 --> 28:23.721
I'd say you got 15 minutes
to get out of here.

28:23.889 --> 28:27.006
- You know you're gonna get trampled.
- I'll handle it.

28:27.169 --> 28:29.637
I'll just tell them I dumped you.

28:30.209 --> 28:34.919
- I'm a bad boy, remember?
- Sure you are.

28:35.089 --> 28:37.922
- Thanks for the flowers.
- You deserve them.

28:38.089 --> 28:41.047
Along with that quiet, normal life
you seem to want so badly.

28:42.169 --> 28:43.887
Thanks.

28:52.009 --> 28:55.399
You're a very bad man,
Mr McNamara.

28:55.569 --> 28:58.129
Selling guns to children.

28:59.449 --> 29:01.758
How truly heartless of you.

29:06.609 --> 29:09.043
Prue must've done something
to light a fire under those idiots.

29:09.209 --> 29:10.562
They're leaving.

29:10.769 --> 29:12.521
Good.

29:12.689 --> 29:14.281
- Which one is that?
- Number eight.

29:14.449 --> 29:16.280
I combined two
separation-of-power spells

29:16.449 --> 29:19.839
with a human-from-animal
extraction spell.

29:20.489 --> 29:22.605
Okay, I have no idea
what you just said.

29:22.809 --> 29:24.208
I'm getting the us out of them.

29:24.489 --> 29:27.208
And if it works, then hopefully
we'll find Dr Williamson.

29:28.009 --> 29:30.079
- First things first.
- Right.

29:32.969 --> 29:34.368
Okay.

29:37.129 --> 29:39.279
Okay. Prue monkey, still hungry?

29:39.489 --> 29:41.207
Look.

29:47.729 --> 29:50.289
- What was that?
- A delayed reaction.

29:50.489 --> 29:53.401
- Phoebe, I think you did it.
- I did do it.

29:56.129 --> 29:59.280
Okay. Here, I'll get it.

30:08.169 --> 30:11.241
Tell me again I'm not hunting
down some demonic son of a bitch.

30:11.409 --> 30:15.084
Darryl, I told you when I called,
he's a human being.

30:15.249 --> 30:17.763
With a supernatural talent
for butchery.

30:17.969 --> 30:21.359
In the past four hours,
this Dr Williamson has dropped off

30:21.529 --> 30:23.645
two more coolers at hospitals,
and he's not bothering

30:23.809 --> 30:25.959
to stitch up his victims anymore.

30:26.129 --> 30:28.324
- He's killing people?
- Yes.

30:30.649 --> 30:33.686
- Tell me where to find him.
- I don't know.

30:33.849 --> 30:35.328
We've staked out all the hospitals,

30:35.489 --> 30:37.957
but somehow he's getting in,
dropping off his gifts

30:38.129 --> 30:40.359
and getting out
without anybody seeing him.

30:41.009 --> 30:42.522
He's using your powers, isn't he?

30:42.689 --> 30:45.726
Yes, but we found a way to stop him.

30:45.929 --> 30:49.604
- Not if I stop him first.
- Darryl, don't kill him.

30:50.289 --> 30:52.086
Have you been listening to me?

30:52.249 --> 30:53.921
He may not give me a choice.

30:55.169 --> 30:58.718
The two people he killed,
Frank McNamara and Arlen Jackson,

30:58.889 --> 31:02.518
they're criminals.
But nobody deserves to die like that.

31:03.569 --> 31:05.639
If you try to stop him, he will kill you.

31:19.369 --> 31:21.405
McNamara.

31:27.769 --> 31:29.441
Phoebe, Leo.

31:32.249 --> 31:34.205
We have to call Prue.

31:34.409 --> 31:35.683
I know where Williamson is.

31:42.169 --> 31:45.161
Bobbie, it's been busy
while I was gone.

31:45.329 --> 31:47.684
You got a buyer for these?
Because I met somebody in County

31:47.849 --> 31:49.965
that might be able
to move them for you.

31:50.129 --> 31:51.687
Bobbie.

31:55.489 --> 31:57.684
Was that his name?

32:03.609 --> 32:05.406
Get out of here now.

32:11.569 --> 32:13.799
- Dr Williamson.
- Piper.

32:14.449 --> 32:17.168
Listen to me, you're sick.
You're doing terrible things.

32:17.649 --> 32:20.721
- I'm saving lives.
- No, you're hurting people.

32:21.049 --> 32:22.368
Piper, be careful.

32:24.409 --> 32:27.606
We have medicine for you.
We think it might help.

32:28.169 --> 32:30.729
You know, I really have you to thank
for all of this.

32:30.889 --> 32:32.242
I couldn't do it without you.

32:33.489 --> 32:35.844
Don't say that.

32:36.009 --> 32:37.806
Here.

32:38.009 --> 32:39.806
Take this, it'll make you better.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.084
Piper.

33:03.329 --> 33:06.605
- We wanna help you.
- I don't want your help.

33:07.769 --> 33:10.920
I'm doing great things.
I'm saving lives.

33:11.089 --> 33:12.317
I got a lot of work to do.

33:13.449 --> 33:17.806
Okay, well,
then this is for the monkeys.

33:19.569 --> 33:21.241
And this is for my sister.

33:48.089 --> 33:50.364
- Any luck?
- No, and I can't figure out

33:50.529 --> 33:51.518
another way to find him.

33:51.689 --> 33:53.839
All I have to do is locate him
through his powers.

33:54.049 --> 33:55.687
Yeah, but his powers
are our powers.

33:55.889 --> 33:58.881
Right, exactly. So the crystal
keeps circling our street,

33:59.089 --> 34:00.966
and I keep finding us.

34:01.369 --> 34:03.200
Okay, keep trying.

34:06.129 --> 34:08.688
Guys, we need to talk about
what we're gonna do.

34:08.889 --> 34:10.481
What do you mean?
I thought we had a plan.

34:10.649 --> 34:11.877
I mean, we have the elixir.

34:12.248 --> 34:14.558
No, not anymore. He trashed it.

34:15.248 --> 34:18.559
- So we'll make more.
- With what? I have nothing left to use.

34:18.929 --> 34:21.762
And the only shop that carries
what I need closed four hours ago.

34:21.969 --> 34:25.166
And even if I made more elixir, Piper,
we'd never get it into him.

34:25.369 --> 34:28.918
- He's much stronger than we are.
- Guys, he was my doctor.

34:29.089 --> 34:31.922
- He tried to save my life, remember?
- He could've killed us, Piper.

34:32.129 --> 34:34.484
- But he didn't.
- No, but he might be out there

34:34.649 --> 34:36.206
right now trying to kill someone else.

34:37.089 --> 34:39.159
Look, we need to face the fact
that he's one innocent

34:39.329 --> 34:42.081
- that we might not be able to save.
- But he needs help.

34:42.728 --> 34:44.367
I know that, honey.

34:44.728 --> 34:46.764
Okay, then.
So, what are you suggesting?

34:49.168 --> 34:50.568
You guys wanna vanquish him?

34:53.248 --> 34:56.797
You can't be serious. He's not
a demon, he's a human being.

34:57.169 --> 34:59.319
Not anymore.

34:59.489 --> 35:03.084
But... Okay. We can't use our powers
to punish anyway. You know that.

35:03.569 --> 35:05.799
Piper, we're not punishing, all right?
We're saving lives.

35:05.969 --> 35:07.448
All you have to do is freeze him.

35:07.649 --> 35:10.368
And then what? You're gonna move
him into the path of an oncoming bus,

35:10.529 --> 35:12.087
drop a building on him, kill him?

35:16.449 --> 35:18.405
Leo, tell me you found
something, anything.

35:19.409 --> 35:22.128
Sorry. I don't think there's any way
out of this one.

35:22.489 --> 35:24.559
I don't believe this.

35:27.489 --> 35:28.638
I found him.

35:49.289 --> 35:51.359
Dr Williamson.

35:53.009 --> 35:56.081
We can help you. But you have to stop
hurting people. It's over.

35:56.449 --> 35:58.485
If you say so.

36:03.729 --> 36:05.321
Let's get out of here.

36:05.489 --> 36:07.241
You should've stayed away.

36:10.649 --> 36:12.844
Okay, Piper, freeze him. Him. Him.

36:17.969 --> 36:20.324
- It's not working.
- Whatever you do,

36:20.489 --> 36:21.524
do not unfreeze that thing.

36:34.809 --> 36:36.401
You know, I'm getting
pretty good at this.

36:36.609 --> 36:37.644
Okay, he's really strong.

36:37.849 --> 36:39.601
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

36:39.769 --> 36:42.078
Piper, you do not let that go, okay?
You do not let that go.

36:42.289 --> 36:43.722
Okay, yelling does not help.

36:44.169 --> 36:48.162
- Piper, when I tell you to, just let go.
- What?

36:48.369 --> 36:50.121
We're done playing around.
Hit the deck, now.

37:00.769 --> 37:02.327
No.

37:04.129 --> 37:06.006
Oh, God. Please don't die.

37:06.169 --> 37:09.002
Come on. Look at me, come on.

37:09.209 --> 37:12.281
Don't do this. Come on.
Come on.

37:12.449 --> 37:13.677
Please don't die.

37:17.529 --> 37:18.882
Piper, honey.

37:21.729 --> 37:23.287
I'm sorry.

37:28.969 --> 37:31.199
Bye-bye, files.

37:35.129 --> 37:39.281
Well, at least everything's
back to normal...

37:41.329 --> 37:42.648
...for us.

37:42.809 --> 37:44.447
At least we're safe.

37:44.609 --> 37:48.238
- Yeah, what about them?
- Oh, they'll be safe tomorrow

37:48.409 --> 37:51.287
when I drop them off
at the wildlife conservatory.

37:51.729 --> 37:55.278
Hey, watch this. You guys,
what do you think of evil?

38:03.089 --> 38:06.286
- You're gonna miss them, aren't you?
- Yeah.

38:08.609 --> 38:10.645
Hey, we've been wondering
where you've been.

38:11.809 --> 38:15.597
You know what?
I have something for you.

38:15.809 --> 38:18.084
What is this?

38:18.249 --> 38:20.399
Ground rules, for me.

38:22.369 --> 38:25.281
"I want a man
who hates my brand of cereal

38:25.489 --> 38:27.605
so there will always
be some for me.

38:27.809 --> 38:30.243
A man whose love
will catch me by surprise."

38:33.089 --> 38:35.080
- What is this?
- It's a wish list.

38:36.369 --> 38:38.485
I hope I find someone
as great as Leo.

38:39.769 --> 38:41.919
You deserve the best,
and I think you found it.

38:45.809 --> 38:50.166
So you guys don't mind
if he's hanging around a lot?

38:50.729 --> 38:52.401
We just want you
to be happy, honey.

39:02.489 --> 39:04.878
Piper.

39:05.089 --> 39:06.317
Are you okay?

39:08.049 --> 39:09.960
His name was Curtis.

39:10.409 --> 39:11.728
Whose name was Curtis?

39:12.649 --> 39:14.446
Dr Williamson.

39:18.169 --> 39:22.242
I read it in his medical bio.
His first name was Curtis.

39:22.409 --> 39:26.846
He never married
because he was working all the time.

39:27.009 --> 39:31.764
Saving lives was more important
to him than having a life of his own.

39:32.089 --> 39:36.002
Now his life is over, and I can't help
but feel responsible for that.

39:36.169 --> 39:37.682
We tried to save him.

39:39.089 --> 39:40.807
But we didn't.

39:41.089 --> 39:42.488
Because we couldn't.

39:43.889 --> 39:45.527
I couldn't.

39:52.049 --> 39:53.880
Should we...?

39:54.569 --> 39:56.719
No, not this time.
