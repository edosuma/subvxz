WEBVTT

00:10.248 --> 00:11.948
So, uh, what're we...

00:11.950 --> 00:13.620
How the hell
are you walking around?

00:13.621 --> 00:16.519
I'm sorry. Should I not be?

00:16.522 --> 00:18.782
Are you... wait,
are you kidding, or...

00:18.791 --> 00:21.061
Archer! Archer,
you shut your mouth!

00:21.062 --> 00:24.429
Because seriously, if you're not...
Archer!

00:24.430 --> 00:28.540
You need to go rustle up a dime
and call Robert goddamn Ripley.

00:28.541 --> 00:31.434
Wait a minute!
I know that voice...

00:31.437 --> 00:34.037
So you're saying when I drive
this truck out of here,

00:34.039 --> 00:37.378
you'd prefer I drove over
your head, not your ankles.

00:37.379 --> 00:39.046
Wait, what? No, no.
No, I meant...

00:39.047 --> 00:40.874
I know what you meant.

00:40.879 --> 00:42.949
Agh!

00:48.453 --> 00:50.453
Ow!

00:50.456 --> 00:53.086
You!
You turned me into a freak!

00:53.091 --> 00:56.431
I think you might be confusing
me with your personal shopper.

00:56.432 --> 00:58.496
My what?
What're you wearing?

00:58.497 --> 00:59.897
You look like...

01:00.565 --> 01:02.465
Ugh!

01:02.468 --> 01:04.334
Ya like that? Archer?

01:04.336 --> 01:05.666
No.

01:05.671 --> 01:07.411
'Cause that's the best
you're gonna feel

01:07.412 --> 01:09.774
for the rest of your short life!

01:09.775 --> 01:11.075
And as for you, Poovey...

01:11.076 --> 01:12.776
Bop, bop, bop,
bop, bop, bop, bop!

01:12.778 --> 01:14.408
What, you don't want Figgis

01:14.413 --> 01:16.513
and ol' Lenny here
to know you were...

01:16.515 --> 01:18.015
You're under arrest, Dutch!

01:18.016 --> 01:19.486
You have the right
to remain silent!

01:19.487 --> 01:21.145
Or get shot in the face!

01:26.123 --> 01:27.623
Go nuts.

01:27.626 --> 01:29.356
Your funeral.

01:29.361 --> 01:30.554
Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no...

01:32.764 --> 01:34.124
Oww!
Son of a...

01:34.132 --> 01:36.992
No, no, no, no...
Stop it!

01:37.002 --> 01:38.862
Ow!
I mean...

01:38.871 --> 01:41.471
You know the definition
of insanity?

01:41.473 --> 01:43.833
You!
You're the definition! You!

01:43.842 --> 01:46.142
Uh, that was rhetorical,
shitheel!

01:46.144 --> 01:48.613
The definition of insanity is...

01:48.614 --> 01:51.944
Suppressing fire!

01:51.950 --> 01:54.619
Oww! What'd ya, eat
a buncha magnets?

01:54.620 --> 01:55.720
Seriously.

01:55.721 --> 01:57.161
Doing the same thing
over and over

01:57.162 --> 01:59.955
and expecting
a different result.

01:59.958 --> 02:02.527
Oh, for... that's
the ransom money!

02:02.528 --> 02:06.128
The what? And my bag! Which,
again, was a gift! Aargh!

02:06.131 --> 02:09.071
Isn't that right, Trexler?
Trexler?

02:10.334 --> 02:11.634
Archer!

02:11.637 --> 02:13.467
Agh!

02:13.472 --> 02:14.802
We gotta, we gotta,
gotta get out,

02:14.806 --> 02:16.374
we gotta get out,
we gotta get out, we...

02:16.375 --> 02:17.505
He's gonna, he's gonna,
we gotta...

02:17.509 --> 02:18.809
You're not a vegetarian,
are you?

02:18.810 --> 02:21.646
We gotta, we gotta, we...
What? Ngh!

02:21.647 --> 02:23.977
Snap out of it.
Ow, Jesus, that hurt.

02:23.982 --> 02:27.512
Right?
Ow! Come on, I snapped already!

02:27.519 --> 02:31.489
I know. I know.
That one was just for me.

03:10.452 --> 03:11.652
Ow!

03:11.654 --> 03:13.791
And that one was
for the Chinese ladies.

03:13.792 --> 03:15.457
Yeah, so about that...

03:15.458 --> 03:17.418
Trexler!

03:17.426 --> 03:19.556
You were saying?
- Uh, never mind!

03:19.562 --> 03:22.600
You gotta get me outta here!
You saw him, he's invincible!

03:22.601 --> 03:23.798
But how? He's like...

03:23.799 --> 03:26.799
He's a goddamn robot!

03:26.802 --> 03:29.402
Aah! At the risk
of another meatslap,

03:29.405 --> 03:31.305
you're kind of an asshole.

03:31.307 --> 03:35.637
Woooooo!

03:37.645 --> 03:40.555
Oh, man.

03:41.416 --> 03:43.676
Huh. Ngh!

03:45.987 --> 03:47.917
Jesus Christ!

03:47.923 --> 03:50.461
- He ain't gonna help you!
- Grab the gimp.

03:50.462 --> 03:52.159
Hang on, lemme try something.

03:52.161 --> 03:53.961
We tried that!
Grab the gimp!

03:53.963 --> 03:55.697
Woooo! Yeah!

03:55.698 --> 03:57.728
Now go, go, go!
Oh!

04:01.269 --> 04:03.139
Aren't ya gonna stay for supper?

04:03.140 --> 04:05.707
I don't think I could eat.
Will that hold him?

04:05.708 --> 04:07.638
It's three inches of solid...
Oh shit!

04:07.643 --> 04:08.713
Damn!
You see.

04:09.778 --> 04:10.938
What the...

04:10.946 --> 04:13.146
Jesus! He's some kinda robot!

04:13.148 --> 04:16.017
Oh, I'll say.

04:16.017 --> 04:17.817
Yikes!
Ah-haa!

04:17.820 --> 04:19.687
Ha-haa!

04:19.688 --> 04:21.688
Um...

04:21.690 --> 04:23.720
- I mean...
- Oops!

04:25.327 --> 04:26.727
Go! Go!

04:29.297 --> 04:30.827
What do you mean, a robot?

04:30.833 --> 04:32.833
I mean, I know a guy
who knows a guy,

04:32.835 --> 04:34.175
who knows a guy who knows a...

04:34.176 --> 04:35.899
Guy?
- Nazi scientist...

04:35.905 --> 04:38.005
What?
- Former! I guess. I don't know.

04:38.007 --> 04:41.667
Anyway, the guy
is a bona fide mad scientist.

04:52.987 --> 04:55.887
Ahem. Or is that just affected
and weird?

05:01.663 --> 05:05.003
And you're telling me this crazy
Nazi can turn people into robots?

05:05.004 --> 05:08.700
Yes! With metal bones!
Motor oil for blood!

05:08.704 --> 05:11.004
Like the, the tin man!

05:11.006 --> 05:14.766
Okay, a, the tin man's not a robot...
The tin man is a...

05:14.777 --> 05:19.607
A magical being! Like a leprechaun,
Pinocchio, an enchanted nutcracker.

05:19.615 --> 05:22.115
Whatever!
He doesn't have a heart!

05:22.117 --> 05:24.247
Just like that
sick bastard out there!

05:24.253 --> 05:26.553
He killed my guys!

05:26.555 --> 05:28.255
Mike.

05:28.257 --> 05:30.257
Fat Mike.
Aw!

05:30.259 --> 05:32.059
It's all your fault!

05:32.061 --> 05:35.191
What? You're the one who
crushed his goddamn ankles!

05:35.197 --> 05:38.857
Uh, rescuing innocent women from
a lifetime of sexual slavery!

05:38.867 --> 05:41.097
Like a meddling asshole!
Wh...?

05:41.103 --> 05:45.242
But, uh, get me out of here alive, and the
ransom money, we'll call it even, okay?

05:45.243 --> 05:48.640
Uh, we're way more than even.
Wh...? How do you figure?

05:48.644 --> 05:53.114
Because your final thought on this
earth wasn't about how my gun tasted.

05:53.115 --> 05:54.482
Fair enough.

05:54.483 --> 05:56.953
Right.
Okay, how's my face look?

05:58.620 --> 06:01.150
It's good.
How's it feel?

06:01.156 --> 06:04.716
Hmm. Honestly, not that bad.
What's that, codeine?

06:04.727 --> 06:07.487
Yeah, mixed with some Dexedrine.

06:07.496 --> 06:10.626
"The adventures of
Dex and Cody."

06:10.633 --> 06:12.473
Let me ask you,
should you be doing that?

06:12.474 --> 06:14.668
"Should you be doing that?"

06:14.670 --> 06:17.570
Actually no, probably not.

06:23.376 --> 06:25.945
Come on, move it!
What're you, hourly?

06:25.946 --> 06:27.113
I mean...

06:27.114 --> 06:28.744
Is it just me, or is it cold?

06:28.749 --> 06:30.219
It's you.
 - Well, your shock.

06:30.220 --> 06:31.617
Just checking.

06:31.619 --> 06:32.849
He needs a hospital!

06:32.853 --> 06:34.253
No shit.
- Easy!

06:34.255 --> 06:36.255
Well?
- I think I own one.

06:36.257 --> 06:38.387
That's great.
Where are your keys?

06:38.392 --> 06:39.782
Applejack drove...

06:39.793 --> 06:40.793
What?
- What.

06:40.794 --> 06:43.224
Keys, idiot!

06:43.230 --> 06:44.464
Mmm...

06:44.465 --> 06:45.795
Eww! Son of a...

06:45.799 --> 06:47.967
I'm priapic!
From the shock!

06:47.968 --> 06:50.637
Shock doesn't cause priapisms!

06:50.638 --> 06:52.738
Sickle-cell anemia?
No.

06:52.740 --> 06:54.409
Then I can only assume
I was bitten

06:54.410 --> 06:56.578
by a Brazilian wandering spider.

06:56.579 --> 06:58.645
Ew!
Ow!

06:58.646 --> 07:00.576
I bet they fell out
in the house.

07:00.581 --> 07:02.450
Oh, dammit!
Can you hotwire it?

07:02.451 --> 07:03.487
Why're you asking me?

07:03.488 --> 07:04.814
Because you know all that shit

07:04.818 --> 07:06.888
about putting breakfast
in the radiator!

07:06.889 --> 07:09.656
What? For a leak.
Potatoes, an egg...

07:09.657 --> 07:10.887
That's pretty common knowledge.

07:10.891 --> 07:12.661
No, it's not.
Also pepper.

07:12.662 --> 07:14.294
Can you hotwire it?
No.

07:14.295 --> 07:15.495
Nobody can.

07:15.496 --> 07:16.966
Because it's English
and it's stupid,

07:16.967 --> 07:19.564
with a bunch of
stupid English wires.

07:23.003 --> 07:25.433
I don't have time for this shit!

07:25.439 --> 07:29.979
Not if that crazy kraut was on the
level about that factor-K shit.

07:29.980 --> 07:33.747
And also...
I've lost track of time!

07:36.450 --> 07:38.250
What was that?

07:38.252 --> 07:40.852
Sounds like somebody's
smashing up all your shit.

07:40.854 --> 07:41.984
With a halberd.

07:41.989 --> 07:43.289
Woooooooo!

07:43.290 --> 07:45.825
Yeah. Can't have anything nice.

07:45.826 --> 07:48.426
That halberd was pretty nice.

07:48.429 --> 07:51.799
Yeah, was.
And why are we going up?

07:57.970 --> 08:01.440
- Something's not right.
- I'll say.

08:01.442 --> 08:04.202
I didn't think it was possible,
but somehow being kidnapped

08:04.211 --> 08:06.681
is even more boring
than my Mother's funeral.

08:06.682 --> 08:09.215
I meant with Archer
and the ransom!

08:09.216 --> 08:11.284
Still, though.
Mr. Zerk.

08:11.285 --> 08:12.545
Rgh?

08:12.553 --> 08:15.353
If the wheels
end up coming off this thing,

08:15.356 --> 08:18.956
obviously
I'll need you to... tie up

08:18.959 --> 08:21.459
all the remaining loose ends.

08:32.739 --> 08:35.808
I wonder what could've
gone wrong.

08:39.313 --> 08:42.842
Son of a bitch.

08:42.850 --> 08:44.584
Is the parking brake off?

08:44.585 --> 08:46.985
Oh.
Goddammit.

08:46.987 --> 08:49.255
Sorry.
Will you hurry up?

08:49.256 --> 08:52.586
He's not lookin' too good!
You're lookin' real good.

08:54.495 --> 08:55.825
But try that hard-on shit
with me,

08:55.829 --> 08:57.699
I'll kick
your dick off your body.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.198
Ahem. Fair enough.

09:01.602 --> 09:03.762
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

09:03.771 --> 09:05.740
Oh, shut up,
you were gonna ditch me!

09:05.741 --> 09:08.608
Yeah, and it woulda
served you right! How?

09:08.609 --> 09:10.247
Oh, don't play dumb with me!

09:10.248 --> 09:12.674
That crazy robot was just
about to finger you

09:12.679 --> 09:14.449
for stealing Trexler's whores!

09:14.450 --> 09:17.283
Wait, what? Finger who? Ow!

09:17.284 --> 09:22.254
That was Archer! What the hell would
I want with a buncha Chinese broads?

09:30.797 --> 09:34.697
Okay, okay.

09:34.701 --> 09:37.970
Jeez. Knock it off!

09:37.971 --> 09:42.241
Maybe they got us
some new diapers.

09:49.649 --> 09:50.883
Ya know?

09:50.884 --> 09:52.814
I wasn't implying you kept them.

09:52.820 --> 09:54.787
Wait, hang on, did you...

09:54.788 --> 09:58.388
Are we gonna stand here
all night yanking our goddamn...

09:58.392 --> 10:01.452
Genitals?
Yes, where did we land on that?

10:01.462 --> 10:03.992
Ugh!
Hey, my keys!

10:03.997 --> 10:05.465
I mean...

10:05.466 --> 10:08.266
Right? What are the odds?

10:08.268 --> 10:11.308
Because, asshole,
if we hadn't gone upstairs

10:11.309 --> 10:13.835
we wouldn't be... whatever!

10:13.841 --> 10:15.341
Shinnying.
Exactly!

10:15.342 --> 10:17.342
Exactly.
And this is the last place

10:17.344 --> 10:19.674
he'd ever think to look for us, so...
Hey, guys!

10:19.680 --> 10:20.680
Wha...?

10:22.015 --> 10:23.545
Oh, wow!

10:25.351 --> 10:28.591
Oh, shit!

10:32.325 --> 10:33.995
And you're sure
you can drive a stick?

10:33.996 --> 10:35.324
As long as I can find
the manual!

10:36.597 --> 10:39.697
Hospital!
Okay, jeez, I'm going!

10:39.700 --> 10:41.000
Guess I better not stall.

10:42.503 --> 10:43.763
Uh, this is a cigar.

10:43.770 --> 10:45.040
Go!

10:46.372 --> 10:48.032
And since Archer was kind enough

10:48.041 --> 10:50.710
to leave his keys
in the ignition... get in!

10:50.711 --> 10:53.379
Umm...
We'll just take my car.

10:53.380 --> 10:55.380
No, actually,
you'll come with me!

10:55.382 --> 10:58.542
To where?
What? My headquarters!

10:58.552 --> 11:00.352
What, like some drag club?

11:00.354 --> 11:02.954
For the...
I'm not a transvestite!

11:02.956 --> 11:04.724
I'm a treasury agent!

11:04.725 --> 11:06.025
What?

11:06.026 --> 11:07.796
And you two are under arrest.

11:07.797 --> 11:09.224
What?

11:09.229 --> 11:11.567
Kidnapping,
conspiracy to commit kidnapping,

11:11.568 --> 11:14.495
grand larceny... oh,
and while we're on the subject,

11:14.501 --> 11:16.241
I'll go ahead
and take the ransom money.

11:16.242 --> 11:17.803
Well, you say that...

11:17.804 --> 11:21.304
Hey, whoa, whoa!

11:21.308 --> 11:25.408
Well. Looks like we've got
ourselves a Mexican standoff.

11:25.412 --> 11:26.802
Oh, does it now?

11:26.813 --> 11:27.873
Yes.
Poovey!

11:27.881 --> 11:29.348
Oh, right.

11:29.349 --> 11:31.389
Wh...? Not at me, you idiot!
At her!

11:31.390 --> 11:33.753
Yeah, she doesn't have
the money.

11:33.754 --> 11:35.984
Oh, you have got to be kidding!

11:35.989 --> 11:38.489
Poovey, put the gun down.
Right?

11:38.492 --> 11:39.652
Shut up.

11:39.660 --> 11:41.729
Listen to me,
you testify against him,

11:41.730 --> 11:45.528
the judge'll go easy on you, and
you're out in like... 20 years!

11:45.532 --> 11:46.932
What?
I meant months!

11:46.934 --> 11:49.264
Nice try, Elliot mess!

11:49.269 --> 11:50.839
Now hand over the dough, Figgis.

11:54.907 --> 11:58.007
What the...? Whatever this is
we don't have time for it!

11:58.011 --> 12:00.780
Excuse me!
I am effecting an arrest!

12:00.781 --> 12:02.621
Great, while you're at it
arrest him!

12:02.622 --> 12:03.616
Who?

12:09.189 --> 12:13.029
If for nothing else,
that outfit.

12:19.602 --> 12:22.332
Now where do you think
you're going?

12:22.338 --> 12:25.006
Nowhere, apparently!

12:24.344 --> 12:26.414
Will you get the hell off me?
- I should drive!

12:26.415 --> 12:29.482
Why should you possibly drive?
- Why should you drive?

12:29.483 --> 12:33.419
Because A, it's my car,
and B, you're a woman!

12:33.420 --> 12:35.190
Hopefully. Now move!

12:37.456 --> 12:40.316
Whoa!
Nice!

12:40.327 --> 12:43.127
Holy shit!
Right? Actually...

12:44.631 --> 12:45.661
Um...

12:48.769 --> 12:51.669
Eat a dick, Gort.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.938
What the... oh, come on.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.785
Oh, damn it!

13:00.947 --> 13:03.677
Hey, we should go to a drive-in!

13:04.650 --> 13:05.750
Whoa!

13:08.287 --> 13:09.287
What?
Whoa!

13:12.124 --> 13:14.293
For the love of god, man,
do something!

13:14.294 --> 13:16.629
Yeah.

13:16.630 --> 13:19.230
Oh, damn it!

13:19.233 --> 13:21.233
Whoa!

13:21.235 --> 13:22.702
- Hang on...
- I am!

13:22.703 --> 13:24.303
Not you! Idiot.

13:26.072 --> 13:28.612
Whoa!

13:29.242 --> 13:30.710
Woooooo!!

13:30.711 --> 13:33.141
Archer!

13:33.146 --> 13:35.706
Ha ha! Holy shit!

13:35.716 --> 13:37.306
Did you see that?
Yeah.

13:37.317 --> 13:40.017
Yes, hurray,
and now can you drive us all

13:40.020 --> 13:42.250
to the federal building
downtown.

13:42.256 --> 13:44.916
Uh, okay.
And why would I do that?

13:44.925 --> 13:47.363
Uh, because you're all
under arrest.

13:47.364 --> 13:50.331
Oh, yeah, what was up with that?
She's a t-man!

13:50.332 --> 13:54.370
Okay, but I'm almost positive that's, you
know, like an insulting term, for...

13:54.371 --> 13:57.898
For the last time!
I am not a transvestite!

13:57.905 --> 14:00.075
Well, probably
not the last time, but...

14:00.076 --> 14:02.541
I am a treasury agent!
What?

14:02.542 --> 14:05.442
And, again,
you are all under arrest!

14:10.082 --> 14:12.182
How is that so goddamn funny?

14:12.185 --> 14:16.088
Oh, my god... because...

14:16.089 --> 14:18.057
That!

14:18.058 --> 14:20.618
Oh, yeah?
Well, how about that?

14:20.627 --> 14:22.557
Yeah!
That's what I thought!

14:22.562 --> 14:24.302
Not that, dummy...

14:26.700 --> 14:29.430
- That.
- Seriously?

14:34.073 --> 14:36.409
<i>He is immortal!</i>

14:36.410 --> 14:39.210
I'm starting to think
you guys don't wanna hang out!

14:40.947 --> 14:42.247
Can somebody...

14:42.249 --> 14:45.219
Suppressing fire!

14:47.254 --> 14:49.954
Wait, were those blanks?

14:49.957 --> 14:52.957
Jesus Christ, Figgis,
you couldn't suppress a cough!

14:52.960 --> 14:54.390
Yes, I could!

14:54.394 --> 14:57.064
I... I apologize,
I stand corrected.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.131
Ow! Goddammit, woman!

15:01.134 --> 15:02.574
Do you have any idea
how bad that is...

15:02.575 --> 15:05.139
Ow!

15:06.573 --> 15:09.213
I swear to god,
if I have to stop this car...

15:10.509 --> 15:13.509
Good idea! Here, lemme give you
a hand with that!

15:19.318 --> 15:20.748
Woooooooo!

15:22.421 --> 15:25.621
Jesus!
Can somebody, please, shoot him?

15:25.625 --> 15:27.660
Um...
Goddammit.

15:27.661 --> 15:28.661
I'm out.
Yep.

15:28.662 --> 15:30.362
I obviously am.
Me too.

15:30.364 --> 15:32.102
Oh, my god.
Okay, take the wheel!

15:32.103 --> 15:33.799
Take the what?
The wheel!

15:33.800 --> 15:36.600
And put your foot on the gas!
I'm gonna jump on the bike!

15:36.603 --> 15:38.337
Yeah!

15:38.338 --> 15:40.198
No, you're not!
Yes, I am!

15:40.207 --> 15:43.207
Big man! Feelin' froggy!

15:43.210 --> 15:45.380
Dammit!
Drive the car, you asshole!

15:45.381 --> 15:47.709
I can do it!
No, you can't!

15:47.714 --> 15:49.384
It's, like, my signature move!

15:49.385 --> 15:51.283
And here I thought
your signature move

15:51.284 --> 15:53.454
was blowing your load
all over a woman's dress

15:53.455 --> 15:54.753
during foreplay!

15:56.389 --> 15:57.549
Wow.
Right?

15:57.557 --> 15:59.187
Totally.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.192
I mean, would you not just die?

16:01.194 --> 16:02.394
Okay, you know what?

16:02.396 --> 16:03.386
Whoa!
Archer!

16:03.397 --> 16:04.697
What the...

16:04.698 --> 16:07.128
Yeah, laugh it up... laughers!

16:07.134 --> 16:09.804
And since you like jokes
so goddamn much...

16:10.703 --> 16:12.203
No, no, no, no, no, no...

16:12.205 --> 16:14.515
No!

16:20.546 --> 16:22.406
Whoa.

16:23.182 --> 16:24.650
Whoa!

16:24.651 --> 16:26.251
Jorge...

16:26.253 --> 16:28.988
Did you hear the one about...

16:28.989 --> 16:30.319
Oh, my god!

16:32.224 --> 16:34.434
Archer, wait!
Or the one about...

16:34.435 --> 16:36.228
Jesus Christ!

16:37.696 --> 16:41.226
Archer! Or, here's one!
Knock knock!

16:46.372 --> 16:49.072
Who's there?
Interrupting cow.

16:49.076 --> 16:50.666
Interrupting cow...

16:50.677 --> 16:53.837
Typical! Typical!
Typical! Typical! Typical!

16:58.217 --> 17:00.047
What could possibly

17:00.053 --> 17:03.222
have been typical about that?

17:03.223 --> 17:07.093
Me! I always do shit like this!
- Like what?

17:07.094 --> 17:09.763
All I wanted to do was find out
who killed my partner Woodhouse,

17:09.765 --> 17:12.601
and the next thing I know I've
disappeared up my own asshole

17:12.602 --> 17:16.569
and I'm manumitting sex slaves
and grossly abusing corpses

17:16.569 --> 17:20.470
and trying to source a finger for
some weird psychosexual kidnapping,

17:20.473 --> 17:23.273
and then, to top off
all the bullshit,

17:23.276 --> 17:26.776
getting chased
by goddamn robots!

17:26.780 --> 17:28.710
I mean, Halberds,

17:28.715 --> 17:30.783
Jesus Christ.

17:30.784 --> 17:33.319
Wait, wait, wait, what was that?

17:33.320 --> 17:35.790
Halberds!
No, no, no, no, did you...

17:35.791 --> 17:37.789
You said your partner's name
was Woodhouse?

17:37.791 --> 17:39.391
Yeah, why?

17:39.392 --> 17:42.328
Woodhouse,
the dope-fiend detective.

17:42.329 --> 17:44.659
What... you... yes! Why?

17:44.664 --> 17:48.334
Because, and I'm sorry kid, I don't
know how to break this to you, but...

17:48.335 --> 17:51.303
But what?

17:51.304 --> 17:53.244
Mother killed Woodhouse.

17:56.142 --> 17:57.372
What?
