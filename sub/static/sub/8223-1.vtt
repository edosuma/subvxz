00:00.809 --> 00:03.210
Do not try any of the experiments

00:03.211 --> 00:05.371
You are about to see at home.

00:05.372 --> 00:08.274
You heard him. Don't do it.

00:09.508 --> 00:11.917
On this episode of "mythbusters"...

00:11.918 --> 00:13.386
One.

00:13.387 --> 00:16.090
...Duck, cover, and hang on,

00:16.091 --> 00:19.304
Because we've got a killer
cocktail of lethal littering...

00:19.305 --> 00:23.379
My weapon of choice -
a potentially lethal slush drink.

00:23.380 --> 00:25.783
...And high-flying
action-movie action.

00:25.784 --> 00:28.121
get to the chopper, grant!

00:28.122 --> 00:29.457
And first up...

00:29.458 --> 00:31.559
Los harmless enough, doesn't it?

00:31.560 --> 00:32.728
Could be deadly.

00:32.729 --> 00:35.200
...Can a soda cup thrown from a car

00:35.201 --> 00:37.401
Really kill an oncoming driver?

00:37.402 --> 00:39.570
Time to inspect the wound.

00:39.571 --> 00:43.475
Then, from helicopter
heaves to fingertip grips,

00:43.476 --> 00:47.279
Can film fall-guys really
hang on hollywood-style?

00:47.280 --> 00:49.281
I would love to see the action hero

00:49.282 --> 00:50.783
That can hang on to that!

00:53.420 --> 00:55.289
Who are the mythbusters?

00:55.290 --> 00:57.758
Adam savage... Here comes chaos.

00:57.759 --> 00:59.293
...And jamie hyneman.

00:59.294 --> 01:01.528
Relax. This won't hurt a bit.

01:01.529 --> 01:05.497
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:05.498 --> 01:07.099
Bye-bye.

01:07.100 --> 01:09.234
Joining them -- kari byron...

01:09.235 --> 01:11.469
High explosives and
electricity. Whoo!

01:11.470 --> 01:12.603
...Tory belleci...

01:12.604 --> 01:14.171
Crashes and fires. This is awesome.

01:14.172 --> 01:15.505
...Grant imahara...

01:15.506 --> 01:16.873
Burn!

01:16.874 --> 01:18.874
And featuring jessi combs.

01:18.875 --> 01:20.008
That was awesome!

01:20.009 --> 01:21.912
They don't just <i>tell</i> the myths.

01:21.913 --> 01:24.548
They put them to the test.

01:24.549 --> 01:27.685

Captions paid for by
discovery communications

01:35.061 --> 01:36.162
Close your eyes.

01:36.163 --> 01:37.763
I'm gonna paint you a
picture with words.

01:37.764 --> 01:38.930
Okay.

01:38.931 --> 01:41.066
I'm driving down the
highway at highway speeds.

01:41.067 --> 01:42.600
I'm just gone to a drive-in,

01:42.601 --> 01:44.735
And I've gotten a soda
in a styrofoam cup,

01:44.736 --> 01:46.370
And it's the wrong soda.

01:46.371 --> 01:47.905
Oh! You hate that!

01:47.906 --> 01:49.139
I know.

01:49.140 --> 01:52.175
So, I hurl the soda out the window,
being a jerk,

01:52.176 --> 01:55.511
And it hits a car going
the opposite direction,

01:55.512 --> 01:58.813
Also at highway speeds,
pierces the windshield

01:58.814 --> 02:00.782
Right in front of the
driver and kills her.

02:02.151 --> 02:04.253
A styrofoam cup does that?

02:04.254 --> 02:05.788
I know!

02:05.789 --> 02:07.523
That is crazy!

02:09.160 --> 02:12.295
As if simply littering
wasn't bad enough,

02:12.296 --> 02:13.830
The villain of this myth

02:13.831 --> 02:17.935
Allegedly killed the
driver of an oncoming car

02:17.936 --> 02:19.871
With a styrofoam soda cup.

02:19.872 --> 02:22.874
Whilst traveling at highway speeds,

02:22.875 --> 02:24.543
Our trash-happy perpetrator

02:24.544 --> 02:27.413
Tossed his unfinished
drink out of the window,

02:27.414 --> 02:29.749
Which supposedly
pierced the windshield

02:29.750 --> 02:32.719
Of an innocent drive-by bystander

02:32.720 --> 02:36.590
With enough force to take
them out permanently.

02:36.591 --> 02:39.860
Okay, now I want to pain.
You a word picture.

02:39.861 --> 02:41.462
I'm not gonna close
my eyes, though.

02:41.463 --> 02:42.763
That's fine. This is a quick one.

02:43.899 --> 02:47.402
We make a cannon that
shoots a cup of soda, huh?

02:47.403 --> 02:48.403
Really?

02:48.404 --> 02:49.805
I somehow pictured two cars

02:49.806 --> 02:51.606
Going at each other,
jousting-fashion,

02:51.607 --> 02:52.908
Tossing cups out the window.

02:52.909 --> 02:54.810
No, no, no -- I figure we'll
get exactly to that place,

02:54.811 --> 02:56.712
But first we need to know
what the cup is filled with.

02:56.713 --> 02:58.714
Is it soda? Is it soda and ice?

02:58.715 --> 03:00.616
Is to ice alone?
Is it the slush drink?

03:00.617 --> 03:03.051
We have to determine what
filling has the most power,

03:03.052 --> 03:05.386
And what's better for
that than a cannon?

03:05.387 --> 03:06.955
Well, all right, then.

03:06.956 --> 03:08.423
I thought you'd like it.

03:09.759 --> 03:13.428
So, before the highway
trash-jousting can begin...

03:14.530 --> 03:16.998
I think that was a hit!

03:16.999 --> 03:20.000
...The guys are going
to arm themselves

03:20.001 --> 03:21.769
With an indoor air cannon

03:21.770 --> 03:24.539
The size of the large
hadron collider.

03:24.540 --> 03:25.640
Well, almost.

03:25.641 --> 03:27.375
I'd say that ought to do it.

03:27.376 --> 03:29.011
Their goal is to discover

03:29.012 --> 03:32.647
Which of the vario possible
combinations of cup contents

03:32.648 --> 03:36.385
Will impart the most
force on impact.

03:36.386 --> 03:40.657
And speaking of the force,
here's the yoda of soda.

03:40.658 --> 03:41.891
So, there you have it --

03:41.892 --> 03:43.826
Our potentially
deadly styrofoam cup.

03:43.827 --> 03:46.129
Now, for the purposes
of our experimentation,

03:46.130 --> 03:47.564
I'm gonna want to know

03:47.565 --> 03:50.300
Exactly how much energy this cup
imparts to something it hits,

03:50.301 --> 03:53.003
Whether it's empty or filled
with different substances.

03:53.004 --> 03:55.706
How am I gonna do that?
With this -- a lode cell.

03:55.707 --> 03:57.775
This little button
here can tell me,

03:57.776 --> 03:59.310
When I hit it with something,

03:59.311 --> 04:01.379
Exactly how much
energy is transferred

04:01.380 --> 04:03.248
From the object to the lode cell.

04:03.249 --> 04:05.416
But here we got an
object that's too big

04:05.417 --> 04:06.817
And a lode cell that's too small,

04:06.818 --> 04:08.986
So I'm going to increase the
surface area of my lode cell

04:08.987 --> 04:11.788
By placing it between these two nice,
heavy steel plates.

04:11.789 --> 04:14.858
Now when this cup hits
this first steel plate,

04:14.859 --> 04:16.692
That will transfer the
energy to the button

04:16.694 --> 04:18.594
And tell me exactly how much energy

04:18.595 --> 04:21.563
This potentially
lethal cup might have.

04:21.564 --> 04:22.631
It's ready.

04:22.632 --> 04:24.966
With the force plate in place,

04:24.967 --> 04:27.201
The guys will be able
to accurately compare

04:27.202 --> 04:30.937
The impact of each cup
fired from the cannon.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.639
Off at a rakish angle. I like it.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.441
So, this is how this works.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.509
We've got our specially
made pressure tank

04:37.510 --> 04:39.277
With a built-in fast-acting valve.

04:39.278 --> 04:41.112
Now, when we open that valve,

04:41.113 --> 04:43.614
All that air comes
out at high speed,

04:43.615 --> 04:47.184
Heads straight down the barrel.

04:47.185 --> 04:51.255
Our cup comes out the end,
hits this plate,

04:51.256 --> 04:53.857
Pushes on the lode cell -
bob's your uncle.

04:53.858 --> 04:55.659
So, robert's your
mother's brother...

04:55.660 --> 04:58.862
Every target needs a motivation.

04:58.863 --> 05:00.430
Yeah!

05:00.431 --> 05:03.266
...And jamie is the light
at the end of the tunnel.

05:04.200 --> 05:11.200
Sync by l3ob@yyets
www.addic7ed.com

05:11.241 --> 05:12.342
So, fall guys,

05:12.343 --> 05:14.277
What are we, testing myths
about '80s tv shows?

05:14.278 --> 05:15.712
Ooh, can we do "a-team" next?

05:15.713 --> 05:16.713
Yes and no.

05:16.714 --> 05:18.348
Yes, we can get to the "a-team,"

05:18.349 --> 05:21.283
And, no, we are not testing
myths about '80s tv shows.

05:21.284 --> 05:22.985
We're actually gonna test
the myths about falling,

05:22.986 --> 05:24.352
Or, more accurately, <i>no falling.</i>

05:24.353 --> 05:25.653
So, you're talking about, like,

05:25.654 --> 05:26.955
The classic hollywood scenario

05:26.956 --> 05:28.422
Where somebody's hanging
on to a high edge

05:28.423 --> 05:30.524
Using nothing but their fingertips.

05:30.525 --> 05:32.626
Exactly. This sounds awesome!

05:32.627 --> 05:35.662
To cling on by your fingertips

05:35.663 --> 05:38.231
Is a classic silver-screen clichÃÂ©.

05:38.232 --> 05:40.600
Apparently, in any action movie,

05:40.601 --> 05:44.004
The hero can hang on indefinitely.

05:44.005 --> 05:47.375
But are any of the many
variations really viable?

05:48.678 --> 05:52.547
To find out, the team will
take on two of the most common.

05:52.548 --> 05:56.785
First, can you really just
hang on until help comes along?

05:56.786 --> 06:00.088
Then, hauling yourself
into a helicopter --

06:00.089 --> 06:01.857
Is it fact or film fiction?

06:01.858 --> 06:05.026
You guys, I have the
perfect place to test this.

06:05.027 --> 06:07.028
There's a fire-training
tower in pleasanton.

06:07.029 --> 06:09.865
It's got ledges all around,
easily accessible rooftop,

06:09.866 --> 06:11.066
And it's pretty tall.

06:11.067 --> 06:12.601
Well, as far as the
hang-time test goes,

06:12.602 --> 06:13.935
There's one thing I'd like to add,

06:13.936 --> 06:15.136
And that's edge thickness,

06:15.137 --> 06:17.805
And see how that affects
how long you can hold onto.

06:17.806 --> 06:19.273
What are we waiting for?

06:19.274 --> 06:21.475
So the team head on out to hang out

06:21.476 --> 06:24.311
At the perfect place to,
you know, hang out.

06:24.312 --> 06:26.814
When we talked about this
in the blueprint room,

06:26.815 --> 06:28.081
It seemed pretty straightforward.

06:28.082 --> 06:30.183
Whoa! This is high!

06:30.184 --> 06:32.085
I mean, we just grab onto an edge

06:32.086 --> 06:33.820
And see how long we can hang on.

06:33.821 --> 06:36.388
But now, standing on top
of this 75-foot building,

06:36.389 --> 06:38.623
I'm wondering,
"is this really necessary?"

06:38.624 --> 06:41.326
I mean, can't we just test
this hanging off a doorframe?

06:41.327 --> 06:45.163
With the team's nerves
suitably primed,

06:45.164 --> 06:46.865
Let's find out
what's on the agenda.

06:46.866 --> 06:48.800
So, the first thing
we're gonna test

06:48.801 --> 06:50.601
Is how long you can
hang onto a ledge.

06:50.602 --> 06:53.771
And to do that, I've built this -
the ledge-o-matic.

06:53.772 --> 06:55.206
It's fully adjustable

06:55.207 --> 06:58.110
So we can block off a controlled
amount of ledge each time.

06:58.111 --> 07:00.612
And we'll get progressively
smaller and smaller

07:00.613 --> 07:02.214
Until we can no longer hang on.

07:02.215 --> 07:04.383
Then we'll have a
good idea of how long

07:04.384 --> 07:06.485
An average joe can
hang onto a ledge.

07:06.486 --> 07:08.520
But beforehe action begins,

07:08.521 --> 07:11.823
Let's meet the man who will be
pulling the piÃÂ±ata strings.

07:11.824 --> 07:13.392
Anybody got a bat?

07:13.393 --> 07:15.127
Aaron, a professional climber,

07:15.128 --> 07:18.196
Is not only helping the team
with their safety protocols...

07:18.197 --> 07:20.332
You're gonna come over the edge,

07:20.333 --> 07:22.267
And then what I want you
to do is say "tension."

07:22.268 --> 07:23.901
He's set up the belay system

07:23.902 --> 07:26.337
So it won't support
the climber's weight,

07:26.338 --> 07:28.139
At least until they fall.

07:28.140 --> 07:29.140
Good?

07:29.141 --> 07:30.942
Yeah, it feels real good.

07:35.881 --> 07:37.849
Tory, you're the guinea pig.

07:37.850 --> 07:39.150
No in the movies,

07:39.151 --> 07:41.653
People hang off of all
shapes and sizes of ledges,

07:41.654 --> 07:43.187
And we are gonna do the same.

07:43.188 --> 07:45.356
The goal is to come
up with a set of data

07:45.357 --> 07:47.691
That correlates ledge
thickness to hang time.

07:47.692 --> 07:49.326
Hook me in.

07:49.327 --> 07:52.162
And to start off with,
we're gonna use a nice, fat ledge.

07:52.163 --> 07:53.763
I'm gonna double-check it,
just in case.

07:53.764 --> 07:56.832
Yep, the ledge width will
be starting at 4 inches.

07:56.833 --> 08:01.870
Which should be plenty of room,
even for "fat finger" belleci.

08:01.871 --> 08:03.772
Getting into position.

08:03.773 --> 08:05.140
Good luck, buddy.

08:05.141 --> 08:07.375
Man, this is kind of scary.
I'm not gonna lie.

08:07.376 --> 08:08.710
Okay.

08:08.711 --> 08:10.044
Okay.

08:10.045 --> 08:13.215
So, this is tory test,
4 inches. Ready? Go.

08:13.216 --> 08:14.783
Hanging.

08:14.784 --> 08:16.785
How you feeling?

08:16.786 --> 08:17.786
Good.

08:17.787 --> 08:19.355
Don't let go.

08:22.125 --> 08:24.894
But even with plenty of room
to get a comfortable grip,

08:24.895 --> 08:29.199
After just 30 seconds,
the strain begins to show.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.301
How you feeling? Good?

08:31.302 --> 08:32.303
Trying to concentrate.

08:32.304 --> 08:33.304
Sorry?

08:33.304 --> 08:35.573
And, as adam once said...

08:35.573 --> 08:36.741
Gravity, man.

08:36.741 --> 08:39.445
It's not just a good idea -
it's the law.

08:39.446 --> 08:43.982
So, unlike a hollywood hero,
tory will inevitably fall.

08:43.982 --> 08:47.820
But exactly how that happens
is a painful surprise.

08:47.821 --> 08:51.022
Uh-oh! Aah! aah!

08:51.023 --> 08:52.857
You all right?

08:52.858 --> 08:54.893
I think you should be glad
that I was the guinea pig.

08:54.894 --> 08:56.027
Oh

08:56.028 --> 08:58.730
I'm bleeding all over like

08:58.731 --> 09:00.432
If you're squeamish, look away,

09:00.433 --> 09:02.934
Because when the
damage is inspected,

09:02.935 --> 09:05.404
A deep gash is the result.

09:05.405 --> 09:07.272
Uh-oh!

09:07.273 --> 09:10.275
But looking ats,
it could have been much worse.

09:11.543 --> 09:15.312
Tory fell a full story
before landing on a ledge,

09:15.313 --> 09:18.615
His shin taking the
full force of the blow.

09:20.184 --> 09:23.520
Yeah, when I saw blood
pouring out my pant legs,

09:23.521 --> 09:25.155
I knew it might be bad.

09:25.156 --> 09:27.691
Next on "mythbusters,"

09:27.692 --> 09:31.729
Adam and jamie dial in on the
deadliest soda-cup contents.

09:31.730 --> 09:33.564
Can you imagine what
that would feel like

09:33.565 --> 09:35.233
If that actually hit your head?

09:42.488 --> 09:46.091
Can a cup of soda thrown
from a passing car

09:46.092 --> 09:48.694
Pierce your windshield
and kill you?

09:48.695 --> 09:50.930
To find out, adam and
jamie first want to know

09:50.931 --> 09:53.966
Which of the potential cup contents

09:53.967 --> 09:56.303
Has the most forceful impact.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.437
How?

09:57.438 --> 09:59.206
Well, here's adam with
some science-y stuff.

09:59.207 --> 10:01.875
Now, I've already explained
that we're collecting the data

10:01.876 --> 10:03.644
About how much force
our cups impart

10:03.645 --> 10:04.912
On this little lode
cell right here.

10:04.913 --> 10:06.246
But how does that work?

10:06.247 --> 10:08.782
It works when a little piezo
element in here gets hit

10:08.783 --> 10:10.851
And creates a small
amount of electricity,

10:10.852 --> 10:13.420
Which is then collected by...

10:13.421 --> 10:16.422
This national instruments
box right here.

10:16.423 --> 10:18.457
This box then sends that data

10:18.458 --> 10:20.993
Over to david and his computer...

10:20.994 --> 10:22.661
Who then informs me and jamie

10:22.662 --> 10:25.565
Of exactly how much force
each of our cups imparts

10:25.566 --> 10:27.100
When it hits the target.

10:27.101 --> 10:29.369
It's about to get
really messy in here,

10:29.370 --> 10:31.371
So I'm gonna take some precautions.

10:31.372 --> 10:35.576
With the shop resembling
a scene from "dexter,"

10:35.577 --> 10:37.946
The wet work can begin.

10:37.947 --> 10:41.349
But before the testing proper,
the guys want a muzzle velocity

10:41.350 --> 10:43.085
That simulates two cars

10:43.086 --> 10:45.887
Approaching each other
at highway speeds --

10:45.888 --> 10:50.192
A cumulative total of
130 miles per hour.

10:50.193 --> 10:53.829
So let's fire her up and
find out what she can do.

10:53.830 --> 10:55.897
Firing in three...

10:55.898 --> 10:56.931
Two...

10:56.932 --> 10:58.466
One.

11:03.038 --> 11:05.106
That was a lot of force.

11:05.107 --> 11:08.710
Yep -- a lot of force...

11:08.711 --> 11:11.178
And a lot of fast.

11:11.179 --> 11:15.149
190 miles per hour.

11:15.150 --> 11:19.219
And to dial that back,
jamie has a neat idea

11:19.220 --> 11:22.055
That accounts for the fact that
the cups will vary in mass.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.890
For these tests to be valid,

11:23.891 --> 11:27.326
All the cups have to hit their
target at about the same speed.

11:27.327 --> 11:29.394
So, after a lot of fussing around,

11:29.395 --> 11:32.697
I figured out that I can
precisely tune the speed

11:32.698 --> 11:36.167
By the placement of
the cup in the barrel.

11:36.168 --> 11:37.835
Okay.

11:37.836 --> 11:41.172
Full cup of ice -- 3 feet,
8 inches.

11:41.173 --> 11:43.441
And that's how we're dialing it in.

11:43.442 --> 11:46.544
Firing in three...

11:46.545 --> 11:48.179
Two...

11:48.180 --> 11:49.147
One.

11:53.052 --> 11:56.121
The final speed was
134 miles an hour.

11:56.122 --> 11:57.590
It's perfect!

11:57.591 --> 12:00.259
So, with their cannon
firing at a constant speed,

12:00.260 --> 12:04.063
We'll soon find out who pulls
the hardest soda-cup punch.

12:04.064 --> 12:05.998
Here's a little story
I like to call,

12:05.999 --> 12:07.433
"oh! This soda's no good!

12:07.434 --> 12:09.101
"they didn't put any ice in it!

12:09.102 --> 12:10.969
I'm gonna throw it out the window."

12:10.970 --> 12:13.871
One cupful of soda,
wrapped in plastic,

12:13.872 --> 12:18.075
Shot out of a cannon at 130
miles per hour, coming right up.

12:18.076 --> 12:20.210
632 grams.

12:20.211 --> 12:23.013
Firing in three...

12:23.014 --> 12:24.482
Two...

12:24.483 --> 12:26.317
One.

12:27.285 --> 12:30.288
that's too much fun.

12:32.525 --> 12:34.859
Well, your laminated face
is holding up quite well.

12:34.860 --> 12:36.094
So I see.

12:36.095 --> 12:40.232
I just love looking
at these like this.

12:40.233 --> 12:41.400
Beautiful!

12:41.401 --> 12:43.435
Can you imagine what
that would feel like

12:43.436 --> 12:44.870
If that actually hit your head?

12:44.871 --> 12:46.972
Final speed -- 132 miles an hour.

12:46.973 --> 12:47.973
Awesome.

12:47.974 --> 12:49.107
What was the force?

12:49.108 --> 12:50.875
3,668.

12:50.876 --> 12:53.377
That's the number to beat.

12:53.378 --> 12:55.646
Weighing in at 632 grams,

12:55.647 --> 13:00.083
A full cup of soda traveling
at 132 miles per hour

13:00.084 --> 13:03.252
Has 3,668 pounds of force.

13:04.688 --> 13:05.922
What's next?

13:05.923 --> 13:07.891
Here's a little story
I like to call,

13:07.892 --> 13:09.492
"oh! I've ordered the soda,

13:09.493 --> 13:11.327
"and I thought I got what I wanted,

13:11.328 --> 13:14.263
"but I didn't order cherry cola,
and this tastes like crap.

13:14.264 --> 13:16.798
So I'm gonna throw it all
the way out the window."

13:16.799 --> 13:19.300
In the red corner,
weighing in at...

13:19.301 --> 13:20.869
649 grams.

13:20.870 --> 13:23.705
...Is a mixed cup of soda and ice.

13:23.706 --> 13:24.839
Let's load her up.

13:24.840 --> 13:27.376
That remind you of working
with cows on the farm?

13:27.377 --> 13:29.078
It does, actually.

13:32.082 --> 13:35.618
Okay, bessie.
It's gonna be all right.

13:37.054 --> 13:39.722
Firing soda and ice in three...

13:39.723 --> 13:40.690
Two...

13:40.691 --> 13:42.525
One.

13:44.761 --> 13:46.462
That's not getting old. No.

13:47.864 --> 13:51.066
Hah!

13:51.067 --> 13:52.568
Wow!

13:52.569 --> 13:54.502
Speed was 134 miles an hour.

13:54.503 --> 13:56.771
What was the force? 4,331.

13:56.772 --> 13:58.840
4,331 -- that's pretty significant.

14:01.076 --> 14:03.878
Interesting -- despite a
small difference in mass,

14:03.879 --> 14:06.147
There was a significant difference

14:06.148 --> 14:07.849
In the force of the impact.

14:08.884 --> 14:11.386
What's next on the menu of mayhem?

14:13.423 --> 14:14.857
Blue slush.

14:14.858 --> 14:19.162
It's basically half ice, half liquid,
all ground up real fine.

14:19.163 --> 14:21.130
Whether that translates
to a higher impact or not,

14:21.131 --> 14:22.265
I don't know.

14:22.266 --> 14:24.601
Personally, it think
it's all about the mass,

14:24.602 --> 14:26.936
But that's what we're
gonna test to find out.

14:26.937 --> 14:28.638
Jamie's correct.

14:28.639 --> 14:31.341
Newtonian physics tells us,
in a perfect world,

14:31.342 --> 14:34.145
Providing they're all
traveling at the same speed,

14:34.146 --> 14:38.281
The cup with the most mass
will have the largest impact.

14:38.282 --> 14:40.685
And this puppy -- if only just --

14:40.686 --> 14:42.787
Is the heavyweight of the litter.

14:42.788 --> 14:46.257
Slush drink in three...

14:46.258 --> 14:47.258
Two...

14:47.259 --> 14:48.192
One.

14:55.033 --> 14:56.367
That is intense!

14:57.368 --> 15:00.136
That's what's making
your lips blue.

15:00.137 --> 15:01.538
Awesome!

15:01.539 --> 15:04.107
Well, the speed is perfect
at 134 miles an hour.

15:04.108 --> 15:05.708
David, what was our force?

15:05.709 --> 15:07.643
4,386.

15:07.644 --> 15:08.744
Dude!

15:08.745 --> 15:10.546
I was hoping that
would be the case.

15:10.547 --> 15:13.882
So, in the soda-cup showdown,

15:13.883 --> 15:16.318
The slush packed the biggest punch.

15:16.319 --> 15:17.319
Why?

15:17.320 --> 15:19.187
Well, it could be the extra mass,

15:19.188 --> 15:21.589
Or it could be that
the slush mixture,

15:21.590 --> 15:24.192
Made up of fine slivers
of ice and liquid,

15:24.193 --> 15:25.661
Enables it to transfer

15:25.662 --> 15:28.363
More of its kinetic
energy to the target

15:28.364 --> 15:29.765
Than the other contenders.

15:29.766 --> 15:31.300
Either way, we have a winner.

15:31.301 --> 15:35.405
The cup with the heaviest
hit and the prettiest splash

15:35.406 --> 15:38.075
Is the slush.

15:38.076 --> 15:40.144
After the break,
with tory in e.R...

15:41.446 --> 15:45.015
...Fall guys grant and
jessi hang out for science.

15:45.016 --> 15:46.450
I would love to see the action hero

15:46.451 --> 15:47.651
That can hang on to that!

15:53.726 --> 15:56.328
Uh-oh! Aah!

15:56.329 --> 15:58.297
In the fall-guy myth,

15:58.298 --> 16:01.667
Tory has once again put
his body on the line.

16:01.668 --> 16:03.469
All in the name of science.

16:03.470 --> 16:06.071
But the science must go on.

16:06.072 --> 16:08.007
Are you bleeding in my car? No.

16:08.008 --> 16:09.742
So while tory takes a trip to e.R.

16:09.743 --> 16:11.410
To stitch up the leak in his leg...

16:11.411 --> 16:14.312
Talk about motivation
<i>no to let go.</i>

16:14.313 --> 16:15.713
Aah!

16:15.714 --> 16:18.749
Bleeding all over like

16:18.750 --> 16:20.951
...Grant and jessi are moving on.

16:20.952 --> 16:24.989
My prediction is I will hang
on for 10 minutes, at least,

16:24.990 --> 16:28.592
And then you'll see the
traces of my fingernails

16:28.593 --> 16:30.194
Going down the wall.

16:30.195 --> 16:32.731
With the adrenaline pumping
and the ledge narrowing...

16:32.732 --> 16:34.566
That's 3 inches.

16:34.567 --> 16:37.202
..."iron grip"
imahara is hooked in...

16:37.203 --> 16:38.571
And out on a limb.

16:38.572 --> 16:39.972
Okay. Climbing.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.276
You hanging? Go.

16:43.277 --> 16:44.410
And with the 3-inch ledge

16:44.411 --> 16:47.347
Not even close to
cramping his style,

16:47.348 --> 16:49.683
His time is similar to tory's.

16:49.684 --> 16:50.984
Okay. Here I go.

16:53.988 --> 16:55.923
Ow.

16:55.924 --> 16:57.958
1:03.

16:57.959 --> 16:59.693
Really? Fairly consistent.

16:59.694 --> 17:01.728
Consistent times -- sure.

17:01.729 --> 17:05.398
But bear in mind the myth is
about hanging on indefinitely...

17:05.400 --> 17:07.835
Does this harness
make me look heavy?

17:07.836 --> 17:11.705
...And our average joes
are consistently falling.

17:11.707 --> 17:13.809
All right. You ready for 2 inches?

17:13.810 --> 17:16.078
My fingers aren't
even 2 inches long.

17:16.079 --> 17:18.079
Of course I'm ready for 2 inches.

17:20.583 --> 17:21.750
Hanging.

17:21.751 --> 17:22.852
Timer is started.

17:22.853 --> 17:24.553
Despite the further narrowing,

17:24.554 --> 17:27.089
Jessi has plenty of
room to work with,

17:27.089 --> 17:30.359
And once again, her time
is in that one-minute slot.

17:30.360 --> 17:31.427
1:06.

17:31.428 --> 17:32.995
Heck yeah.

17:32.996 --> 17:34.429
Yeah, they're starting to slip.

17:34.430 --> 17:36.165
Yeah? Yeah.

17:36.166 --> 17:37.533
Here I go.

17:37.534 --> 17:38.533
Aah!

17:38.534 --> 17:41.036
Nice!

17:41.037 --> 17:42.871
1:17.

17:42.872 --> 17:45.373
Whoo-hoo!

17:45.374 --> 17:47.908
So, we are halfway
done with our testing,

17:47.909 --> 17:49.443
And so far, we've established

17:49.444 --> 17:51.879
An average hang time
for the average joe

17:51.880 --> 17:53.580
Of 60 seconds.

17:53.581 --> 17:54.726
Uh-oh! Aah!

17:55.306 --> 17:57.807
Now, the 2 inches wasn't that bad.

17:57.808 --> 18:00.009
I mean, I was able to
hang on for over a minute,

18:00.010 --> 18:02.211
But now we're gonna work
our way down to 1 inch.

18:02.212 --> 18:04.948
And this is where it's really
gonna start getting challenging,

18:04.949 --> 18:06.483
See what happens.

18:06.484 --> 18:10.321
At one inch, the guys really
are down to a fingertip grip.

18:10.322 --> 18:11.789
Jessi is about to find out

18:11.790 --> 18:15.093
If hanging on to that
slimmest of margins

18:15.094 --> 18:17.863
Is movie make-believe or
a real-life possibility.

18:17.864 --> 18:20.366
Dude, this hurts way much more.

18:20.367 --> 18:21.767
Hang on, there, jessi.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.536
All right, here I go.

18:25.172 --> 18:26.239
Whoo!

18:26.240 --> 18:28.341
33 seconds.

18:28.342 --> 18:30.076
That is much, much more difficult.

18:30.077 --> 18:31.077
Really? Yeah.

18:31.078 --> 18:32.445
Yep, really.

18:32.446 --> 18:34.780
It was less than half the hang
time of the previous test,

18:34.781 --> 18:37.550
When ledge width wasn't a factor,

18:37.551 --> 18:40.352
Which doesn't bode well for grant,

18:40.353 --> 18:44.756
Because he's up next and
he's running out of room.

18:44.757 --> 18:48.261
That, my friends, is 1/2 of 1 inch.

18:48.262 --> 18:51.565
And that is about how
much I can hang on.

18:51.566 --> 18:55.836
I'm predicting a lot of pain,
but not for very long.

18:55.837 --> 18:58.173
Let's do this.

18:59.342 --> 19:00.642
Okay.

19:00.643 --> 19:03.278
But he can't turn that
steely determination

19:03.279 --> 19:05.114
Into an iron grip...

19:05.115 --> 19:06.114
Oh, my god.

19:06.115 --> 19:07.349
this is crazy.

19:07.350 --> 19:09.252
...Because he simply can'.
Get a grip...

19:09.253 --> 19:10.253
You ready?

19:10.254 --> 19:11.754
I'm so ready.

19:11.755 --> 19:13.522
Aah!

19:13.523 --> 19:14.991
Nothing!

19:14.992 --> 19:16.192
Not even a second.

19:16.193 --> 19:17.159
Ow.

19:17.160 --> 19:18.961
...And his time reflects that.

19:18.962 --> 19:20.962
I would love to see the action hero

19:20.963 --> 19:22.497
That can hang on to that!

19:22.498 --> 19:25.868
You know, you try and get
yourself in the mind-set, like,

19:25.869 --> 19:28.971
"I have got to hang onto this,
or I'm gonna fall or die."

19:28.972 --> 19:30.306
Aah!

19:30.307 --> 19:32.742
But it's not really a choice
with a half-inch ledge.

19:32.743 --> 19:35.612
I mean, the second I put
my weight on there, "pow!"

19:35.613 --> 19:38.716
All my fingers exploded,
and then I'm flying through the air.

19:38.717 --> 19:42.386
And it was just that quick.
No way. Impossible.

19:42.387 --> 19:46.290
So, in direct contradiction
to the movies,

19:46.291 --> 19:49.660
If you find yourself hanging
on by your fingernails,

19:49.661 --> 19:51.595
You're not hanging
on for very long.

19:51.596 --> 19:52.830
Nothing!

19:52.831 --> 19:57.601
And even with room to work with,
it's a tough task.

19:57.602 --> 19:59.269
In a real-life situation,

19:59.270 --> 20:02.472
You'd better hope help
arrives hollywood-style --

20:02.473 --> 20:05.142
Fast and in the nick of time.

20:05.143 --> 20:08.012
But this is an action-movie myth.

20:08.013 --> 20:10.081
How would a hollywood hero cope?

20:10.082 --> 20:13.419
So, move over,
average joe and average jessi

20:13.420 --> 20:16.289
And step up, action man aaron.

20:16.290 --> 20:17.390
That's why I'm here.

20:17.391 --> 20:20.727
First up, aaron tackles
the 1-inch ledge.

20:20.728 --> 20:22.129
Okay, start.

20:22.130 --> 20:23.364
And we're up and running.

20:23.365 --> 20:27.001
And he significantly
improves on jessi's time.

20:27.002 --> 20:30.538
You're shaking. Ohhhh!

20:31.640 --> 20:33.074
Whoo!

20:33.075 --> 20:34.308
48 seconds.

20:34.309 --> 20:35.943
Nice.

20:35.944 --> 20:37.879
But what's <i>really</i> impressive

20:37.880 --> 20:39.580
Is aaron's half-inch performance.

20:41.083 --> 20:42.717
Yeah, it's tiny,
isn't it? It's tiny.

20:42.718 --> 20:46.454
Remember -- grant couldn't
hold on for a single second.

20:46.455 --> 20:47.856
Okay. Okay.

20:47.857 --> 20:49.691
He's hanging in there.

20:49.692 --> 20:50.825
Whoo!

20:50.826 --> 20:52.561
You're doing awesome.

20:52.562 --> 20:55.164
I can't believe you're
still hanging on.

20:55.165 --> 20:57.066
aah!

20:57.067 --> 21:00.970
Aah! Ho ho ho! Nice!

21:00.971 --> 21:02.872
14 seconds!

21:02.873 --> 21:04.940
That was great!

21:09.278 --> 21:12.379
All right, so, even if you're
a super-strong climber,

21:12.380 --> 21:14.048
You only got about 14 seconds

21:14.049 --> 21:16.216
Before you fall off a
super-skinny ledge.

21:16.217 --> 21:17.752
Yeah, I mean, this whole idea

21:17.753 --> 21:20.254
That you can hang on
indefinitely in action movies --

21:20.255 --> 21:21.255
Totally busted.

21:21.256 --> 21:22.689
yeah. Busted.

21:26.027 --> 21:29.096
Up next, buster's in the hot seat

21:29.097 --> 21:30.831
For some lethal litter-jousting.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.535
And the fall-guy myth takes off.

21:34.536 --> 21:35.769
Oh, look! Turbulence!

21:35.770 --> 21:37.504
Hang on, everybo! hang on!

21:44.249 --> 21:47.334
In their quest to test
soda-cup lethality...

21:47.335 --> 21:48.435
One.

21:48.436 --> 21:50.504
...Adam and jamie have
spent an afternoon

21:50.505 --> 21:52.206
Firing drinks out
of an air cannon...

21:53.241 --> 21:55.409
...At a laminated
picture of jamie...

21:56.644 --> 21:57.878
As you do.

21:57.879 --> 22:00.314
I think your face is holding
up surprisingly well.

22:00.315 --> 22:02.983
Yeah, I don't usually react
when I get hit in the face.

22:02.984 --> 22:04.551
And so far, they've seen

22:04.552 --> 22:07.387
That the slush drink
is the heaviest hitter.

22:07.388 --> 22:11.659
But is that power enough
to penetrate a windshield

22:11.660 --> 22:15.329
And give the driver a
severe case of dead?

22:15.330 --> 22:16.430
Moving on...

22:16.431 --> 22:17.631
I don't see why not.

22:17.632 --> 22:19.734
We have already determined
the awesome power

22:19.735 --> 22:21.469
Of non-trademark blue slush drink.

22:21.470 --> 22:22.937
Well, what's next, then?

22:22.938 --> 22:25.172
Well, I think it's exactly what
you stated at the beginning.

22:25.173 --> 22:26.540
We line two cars up
facing each other,

22:26.541 --> 22:27.941
Race towards each other,
jousting-style,

22:27.942 --> 22:29.443
At highway speeds,

22:29.444 --> 22:32.446
And I hurl a cup of blue slush
drink right at your windshield.

22:33.881 --> 22:35.649
I don't think that
would be a good idea.

22:35.650 --> 22:38.685
What's say we hang a windshield
off to the <i>side</i> of my car

22:38.686 --> 22:40.387
And we aim the soda at that?

22:40.388 --> 22:42.055
Done! Let's do it.

22:42.056 --> 22:45.658
With his handy home delivery of
windshields, adam goes to work.

22:47.061 --> 22:49.095
By hanging them off
the side of the truck

22:49.096 --> 22:50.997
And placing buster
in the hot seat...

22:50.998 --> 22:54.734
Our crash-test dummy will sit...

22:54.735 --> 22:56.870
...Here.

22:56.871 --> 22:59.206
...They'll be able to
test the myth in safety.

22:59.207 --> 23:00.574
Well, safe for some.

23:00.575 --> 23:02.810
You know it's gonna be a bad day

23:02.811 --> 23:05.412
When you're painted bull's-eye red.

23:05.413 --> 23:07.080
This may sting a little.

23:09.951 --> 23:13.987
And out on location,
it's time to paint a picture.

23:13.988 --> 23:15.855
Here's how this whole
thing's gonna play out.

23:15.856 --> 23:17.557
I'm gonna play the
role of the passenger

23:17.558 --> 23:19.526
Careening down the freeway
at 60 miles an hour,

23:19.527 --> 23:21.060
Sucking on a slush drink I just got

23:21.061 --> 23:22.495
At, let's say, the drive-through.

23:22.496 --> 23:24.730
"hey! That's not the one
I ordered," I'll say.

23:24.731 --> 23:27.666
And, cavalierly,
I will throw it out the window!

23:27.667 --> 23:29.535
It flies through the air.

23:29.536 --> 23:32.604
And, "smack!
" it hits our windshield.

23:33.672 --> 23:36.074
If our cup happens to make
it through our windshield

23:36.075 --> 23:38.243
And hit into buster, well,
we're going to have

23:38.244 --> 23:40.146
Strategically placed
shockwatch stickers

23:40.147 --> 23:41.714
On both his chest and his head.

23:41.715 --> 23:43.850
And that way, we'll know
whether he got hurt.

23:43.851 --> 23:47.955
So, buster's ready.
The course is ready.

23:47.956 --> 23:50.858
And after a couple
of dry drive-bys,

23:50.859 --> 23:53.328
Our drivers are ready.

23:53.329 --> 23:55.096
Beautiful.

23:57.300 --> 23:59.602
Looks harmless enough, doesn't it?

23:59.603 --> 24:01.504
Could be deadly.

24:01.505 --> 24:06.609
With blue slush in hand,
let the lethal litter-jousting begin.

24:06.610 --> 24:07.977
Jamie, are you ready to go?

24:07.978 --> 24:09.679
I'm in position and ready to go.

24:09.680 --> 24:12.816
40-mile-per-hour run
with a real slush drink

24:12.817 --> 24:14.050
In three...

24:14.051 --> 24:15.051
Two...

24:15.052 --> 24:16.987
One...Go!

24:16.988 --> 24:19.356
In the next test,
they'll  facing off

24:19.357 --> 24:23.427
At a more realistic highway
speed of 60 miles an hour.

24:23.428 --> 24:26.197
But for the moment,
adam's just getting his eye in.

24:26.198 --> 24:27.265
A little bit closer.

24:33.941 --> 24:35.775
I think I might have hit it!

24:37.345 --> 24:39.946
Dude! That's a hit! Look at that!

24:39.947 --> 24:41.281
Wow, and that's only
40 miles an hour.

24:41.282 --> 24:45.418
At 40 miles per hour,
that is spooky-promising for this.

24:45.419 --> 24:49.490
That was just a test run,
and I didn't fully hit the windshield,

24:49.491 --> 24:52.560
And you're seeing a kind
of shocking amount of dame

24:52.561 --> 24:55.029
From our 40-mile-per-hour run.

24:55.030 --> 24:56.297
That's awesome!

24:57.433 --> 24:59.167
I think we can tighten
a lot of this up.

24:59.168 --> 25:01.302
I think jamie could drive a
little bit closer to the cones,

25:01.303 --> 25:03.404
I think my aim will get
better as we do this,

25:03.405 --> 25:06.507
But right now I feel
pretty good about this one.

25:06.508 --> 25:10.712
Controlled mayhem -- check.
Chance of science -- high.

25:10.713 --> 25:15.750
Happy mythbusters -- confirmed.
Forecast -- ramping it up.

25:15.751 --> 25:17.819
My vehicle -- experimental.

25:17.820 --> 25:22.023
My weapon of choice -
a potentially lethal slush drink.

25:23.025 --> 25:24.992
This is 60 miles an hour,

25:24.993 --> 25:28.296
Styrofoam cup with
slush drink in three...

25:28.297 --> 25:29.297
Two...

25:29.298 --> 25:30.298
One...

25:30.299 --> 25:32.734
Go! Aah!

25:32.735 --> 25:34.102
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

25:34.103 --> 25:36.671
it's very exciting.

25:40.243 --> 25:42.678
Looking really good.

25:46.050 --> 25:47.784
Yeah!

25:49.454 --> 25:51.555
I think that was a perfect hit!

25:58.563 --> 26:01.831
I don't know about you,
but that'd kind of bum me out.

26:01.832 --> 26:04.501
That's a bull's-eye of bull's-eyes.

26:04.502 --> 26:05.668
nicely done.

26:08.204 --> 26:09.238
A perfect hit.

26:09.239 --> 26:11.540
The cup was aimed
straight at buster.

26:11.541 --> 26:12.707
So, how did he do?

26:12.708 --> 26:15.076
Checking buster's vitals.

26:15.077 --> 26:16.878
I can see them. They're all clean.

26:16.879 --> 26:22.117
Yeah, he didn't take an.
Letha damage, but...

26:22.118 --> 26:24.019
Hell, if that happened to your car,

26:24.020 --> 26:27.156
You'd be a very unhappy,
probably unsafe driver.

26:27.157 --> 26:29.224
Well, not to mention the fact

26:29.225 --> 26:32.094
That you might well
have a crash afterwards

26:32.095 --> 26:33.262
Because you can't see anything.

26:33.263 --> 26:34.863
Exactly.

26:34.864 --> 26:39.234
There's no doubt the impact
would have caused a crash,

26:39.235 --> 26:43.071
But incredibly, buster seems
to have escaped direct injury.

26:43.072 --> 26:47.943
And check out the big brain on jamie,
because he knows why.

26:47.944 --> 26:50.846
This windshield,
like all windshields these days,

26:50.847 --> 26:52.647
Is made out of laminated glass.

26:52.648 --> 26:53.982
What's that mean?

26:53.983 --> 26:56.217
Well, what they do is,
they take two sheets of glass

26:56.218 --> 26:59.188
And bond it together with a
rubbery plastic in between.

26:59.189 --> 27:01.990
And that way, even though
the glass goes all blotto

27:01.991 --> 27:06.262
Like it does here, that membrane
holds everything together.

27:06.263 --> 27:08.531
In fact, you can see on
our high-speed camera

27:08.532 --> 27:10.933
How it ballooned out in
the back when it got hit.

27:10.934 --> 27:13.036
But it didn't get a hole in it.

27:13.037 --> 27:16.206
Of course, sooner or later,
we're gonna put a hole in it.

27:20.679 --> 27:22.981
So, there's one more
thing I want to test.

27:22.982 --> 27:23.982
What's that?

27:23.983 --> 27:25.150
It is a movie classic.

27:25.151 --> 27:27.085
The hero is rescued
by a helicopter.

27:27.086 --> 27:29.722
However, the helicopter
does not have time to land.

27:29.723 --> 27:30.723
Right.

27:30.724 --> 27:32.292
He has to grab onto the skid,

27:32.293 --> 27:34.694
Pull himself up and
over and into the cabin,

27:34.695 --> 27:36.763
Despite the downdraft
from the blades

27:36.764 --> 27:39.499
And the onrushing air as
the helicopter flies away.

27:39.500 --> 27:40.867
That's a great myth,

27:40.868 --> 27:43.102
But nobody's gonna let us
hang from a real helicopter.

27:43.103 --> 27:44.270
You're right, and that is why

27:44.271 --> 27:45.939
We are gonna build ou.
Own helicopter.

27:45.940 --> 27:47.140
And then what we'll do is,

27:47.141 --> 27:49.142
We'll measure the downdraft
created by a helicopter,

27:49.143 --> 27:50.610
And that will
transfer into a weight

27:50.611 --> 27:52.311
That we'll wear while
we're experimenting.

27:52.312 --> 27:53.413
Perfect.

27:53.414 --> 27:55.581
Let's no.Hover around here anymore.

27:55.582 --> 27:59.552
So, to get a head-start on the
myth of the chopper climb...

27:59.553 --> 28:01.920
this-a how we make-a
the grant-a head.

28:01.921 --> 28:05.290
...Tory once again makes
a new head for grant.

28:07.226 --> 28:08.392
"hey, he's got a robot!"

28:08.393 --> 28:09.727
That's enough out of you.

28:09.728 --> 28:11.996
So, what I have here is
grant's head and shoulders.

28:11.997 --> 28:13.764
This is gonna give us
the same surface area

28:13.765 --> 28:15.899
As somebody holding on
to the helicopter's skid.

28:15.900 --> 28:18.268
Now, I have attached
grant to this scale,

28:18.269 --> 28:20.705
So that way if there's any
change in the downforce,

28:20.706 --> 28:21.972
We'll be able to measure it.

28:23.808 --> 28:24.742
It works.

28:28.379 --> 28:31.281
Now, obviously, the most
direct way to test this myth

28:31.282 --> 28:34.618
Would be to try to hang from a
helicopter while it's flying.

28:34.619 --> 28:38.488
But unfortunately, the insurers
tell us it's too dangerous.

28:38.489 --> 28:41.257
But don't worry,
because we have a cunning plan,

28:41.258 --> 28:44.360
Which still involves
a real helicopter.

28:44.361 --> 28:47.763
And we've enlisted the help
of makin air helicopters

28:47.764 --> 28:49.431
To test this myth.

28:49.432 --> 28:52.200
So they're about to find out
how much downdraft there is

28:52.201 --> 28:55.303
By hovering directly overheathhead.

28:55.304 --> 28:59.107
And in close, the downforce
is surprisingly small.

28:59.108 --> 29:02.745
So, it's roughly
around 50 to 80 grams

29:02.746 --> 29:04.380
When he's just hovering...

29:04.381 --> 29:06.582
Which is fairly insignificant.

29:06.583 --> 29:10.420
And even a sudden takeoff
doesn't make much difference.

29:10.421 --> 29:14.123
So, it got up to a little
over 100 grams on that e.

29:14.124 --> 29:15.391
100 grams is nothing.

29:15.392 --> 29:17.026
Your clothes weigh
more than 100 grams.

29:17.027 --> 29:20.196
So, we just finished testing the
downforce of the helicopter,

29:20.197 --> 29:21.998
And the results were
very consistent.

29:21.999 --> 29:24.333
We had him hover above our scale.

29:24.334 --> 29:26.968
As he came down,
the weight increased.

29:26.969 --> 29:30.204
However, it only got to 50 grams,
which is nothing.

29:30.205 --> 29:32.039
I mean, your clothes
weigh more than that.

29:32.040 --> 29:33.908
And at one point,
we had him punch it

29:33.909 --> 29:35.409
As if he was taking off,

29:35.410 --> 29:37.744
And it peaked at about 130 grams,

29:37.745 --> 29:40.213
Which is still not
that much weight.

29:40.214 --> 29:42.816
So it looks like the
downforce of the helicopter

29:42.817 --> 29:46.086
Really isn't gonna affect your
ability to hang onto the skid.

29:46.087 --> 29:49.556
So, in summary,
and somewhat unexpectedly,

29:49.557 --> 29:51.958
The team can ignore the downdraft

29:51.959 --> 29:53.727
From the chopper blades...

29:53.728 --> 29:57.731
And go to work at
the next location.

29:57.732 --> 30:00.568
Best commute ever!

30:00.569 --> 30:03.938
No signs prohibiting heavy
machinery or mythbusting --

30:03.939 --> 30:06.508
Perfect, because at the pool,

30:06.509 --> 30:08.043
They've got everything they need,

30:08.044 --> 30:12.715
Including a cool chopper mock-up
jessi knocked up at the shop.

30:12.716 --> 30:14.683
All right, so it may not
be a real helicopter

30:14.684 --> 30:16.351
And a lot of it is
made from plywood,

30:16.352 --> 30:18.653
But I'd have to say it's a
pretty darn good helicopter

30:18.654 --> 30:19.887
For the amount of time I had.

30:19.888 --> 30:21.589
Where's rick and t.C., man?

30:21.590 --> 30:24.158
Most importantly,
everything is to spec.

30:24.159 --> 30:25.893
These struts are 45 degrees,

30:25.894 --> 30:28.629
And the skids are
3-inch-diameter tubing,

30:28.630 --> 30:30.764
Just like a real helicopter.

30:30.765 --> 30:33.200
Now, how many times have you watched,
in an action film,

30:33.201 --> 30:35.970
Somebody jump onto a helicopter
and climb up as it's taking off?

30:35.971 --> 30:37.204
Now we get to try it.

30:37.205 --> 30:39.507
I mean, we're living out
our action-hero fantasies.

30:39.508 --> 30:42.644
The idea is that we will
be suspended over a pool.

30:42.645 --> 30:44.112
Mythbuster p.I., ready for takeoff.

30:44.113 --> 30:46.382
That way, if we fall,
we won't fall to our death.

30:46.383 --> 30:47.683
We'll just fall in the pool.

30:47.684 --> 30:50.687
We have liftoff.
We have liftoff here.

30:50.688 --> 30:53.990
The goal is to hang on to the skid,

30:53.991 --> 30:57.626
Pull yourself up and over and
into the cockpit to safety.

30:57.627 --> 30:59.027
Aah! Oh, look! Turbulence!

30:59.028 --> 31:00.996
Hang on, everybody! hang on!

31:00.997 --> 31:04.833
But a set of realistic
skids on a fake chopper

31:04.834 --> 31:07.168
Is not the only obstacle
the guys will encounter

31:07.169 --> 31:08.936
On their climb to safety.

31:08.937 --> 31:11.372
Based on our test with
the real helicopter,

31:11.373 --> 31:13.874
We know that the downward
force at hover is minimal.

31:13.875 --> 31:16.509
But let's face it -
this is an action movie.

31:16.510 --> 31:17.877
They have to fly away.

31:17.878 --> 31:20.680
How do you simulate
flight at a swimming pool?

31:20.681 --> 31:22.616
With this.

31:22.617 --> 31:24.885
This is a 6-foot-diameter fan blade

31:24.886 --> 31:28.155
Connected to a 350-horsepower
big-block engine.

31:29.958 --> 31:31.959
It's capable of
generating wind speeds

31:31.960 --> 31:34.895
Of up to 95 miles per hour.

31:38.266 --> 31:40.968
That's enough to simulate the
cruising speed of our helicopter

31:40.969 --> 31:42.936
And more than enough
to test this myth.

31:42.937 --> 31:46.440
Coming up, adam and jamie
are gunning for buster...

31:46.441 --> 31:48.108
I want a bull's-eye!

31:48.109 --> 31:53.746
...And our stunt guys and girl
give the fall-guy myth a leg up.

32:00.058 --> 32:04.029
Mmm, delicious "mythbusters"
non-trademark slush drink --

32:04.213 --> 32:07.415
Icy, fruity, blue,
and potentially lethal.

32:07.416 --> 32:08.850
Use with caution.

32:08.851 --> 32:11.286
Extreme caution...

32:11.287 --> 32:14.989
Because throwing one from
your car at 60 miles per hour

32:14.990 --> 32:16.291
Does this.

32:16.292 --> 32:20.729
Remember -- we do it
so you don't have to.

32:20.730 --> 32:23.865
Buster and I hope this
provides a lesson in caution

32:23.866 --> 32:26.402
To anyone who would
mishandle a slush drink.

32:26.403 --> 32:29.272
Not only is the primary
damage to the windshield

32:29.273 --> 32:31.708
Absolutely shocking,
but the secondary damage,

32:31.709 --> 32:34.144
The effect of the driver
not being able to see

32:34.145 --> 32:36.046
Through the spider webbing
on the windshield,

32:36.047 --> 32:38.615
Would very likely cause
a really bad accident.

32:38.616 --> 32:40.718
I would not have called
that much damage.

32:40.719 --> 32:41.719
That is shocking.

32:41.720 --> 32:43.254
It doesn't get much worse.

32:43.255 --> 32:47.324
Well, if your name is buster,
it does get much worse,

32:47.325 --> 32:48.392
Because they're going again.

32:48.393 --> 32:49.626
This time, we made sure

32:49.627 --> 32:51.595
Our windshield stays
firmly in place.

32:51.596 --> 32:53.430
Now, on our last test,

32:53.431 --> 32:57.001
The whole windshield
collapsed and fell out,

32:57.002 --> 32:58.936
So, in a sense,

32:58.937 --> 33:01.405
It was absorbing a lot of
the shock by doing that.

33:01.406 --> 33:03.241
And if we secure the windshield

33:03.242 --> 33:05.976
And make sure it stays
firmly in place,

33:05.977 --> 33:07.278
What I'm hoping for

33:07.279 --> 33:09.947
Is that the projectile,
when it hits it,

33:09.948 --> 33:13.051
Will concentrate all
its energy in one spot.

33:13.052 --> 33:15.587
And it might just make it
all the way through it.

33:15.588 --> 33:17.990
All right! I see them up ahead!

33:19.893 --> 33:21.360
I want a bull's-eye!

33:22.561 --> 33:26.765
I think that was a bull's-eye!

33:30.369 --> 33:33.171
Time to inspect the wound.

33:34.673 --> 33:36.975
wow!

33:36.976 --> 33:40.579
Look at that! I am blown away!

33:40.580 --> 33:42.781
That is penetration.

33:42.782 --> 33:45.051
did we trip anything on the guy?

33:46.186 --> 33:47.520
It doesn't look like it.

33:47.521 --> 33:50.823
So, despite the
promising-looking penetration,

33:50.824 --> 33:52.358
The windshield once again

33:52.359 --> 33:55.328
Successfully dissipated
the energy of the impact.

33:55.329 --> 33:57.964
Buster got wet, not dead.

33:57.965 --> 33:59.832
Looks to me like the
windshield's actually

33:59.833 --> 34:01.067
Taking a lot of the load.

34:01.068 --> 34:02.302
It's absorbing it.

34:02.303 --> 34:03.303
Yeah.

34:03.304 --> 34:04.971
Liquid makes it through,

34:04.972 --> 34:08.909
But it's more of a splash than
some kind of a cohesive lump.

34:08.909 --> 34:10.043
Look, I have no doubt

34:10.043 --> 34:11.812
That if you took a
hit from just the cup

34:11.813 --> 34:13.647
Hitting you in the head
at 120 miles an hour,

34:13.648 --> 34:14.981
It would kill you.

34:14.982 --> 34:17.551
I think this windshield is
protecting him sufficiently.

34:17.552 --> 34:18.485
I do, too.

34:20.487 --> 34:22.489
Well, several destroyed windshields

34:22.489 --> 34:24.458
And several delicious
slush drinks later,

34:24.458 --> 34:25.893
I'm pretty satisfied

34:25.893 --> 34:28.795
That a slush drink does not
create a primary lethal hazard

34:28.795 --> 34:30.230
On the freeway.

34:30.231 --> 34:32.866
It's not going to penetrate
your windshield and kill you.

34:32.867 --> 34:34.501
Make no mistake, though --

34:34.502 --> 34:38.205
It creates a very serious set of
<i>secondar lethal hazards.</i>

34:38.206 --> 34:39.639
One, it totally obliterates

34:39.641 --> 34:41.943
Your ability to see
through the windshield.

34:41.944 --> 34:44.245
Two, it covers you with
sticky slush drink.

34:44.246 --> 34:46.848
Three, splinters of glass
are covering your body

34:46.849 --> 34:47.949
And your face.

34:47.949 --> 34:50.217
All three of these
things would be enough

34:50.219 --> 34:52.353
To cause a very,
very serious accident.

34:52.353 --> 34:54.822
But as for the slush
drink itself being lethal

34:54.822 --> 34:56.389
Through a windshield, I say no.

34:56.391 --> 34:57.492
I say it's busted.

34:57.493 --> 35:00.195
Busted, but the fun's not done.

35:03.866 --> 35:04.866
We have liftoff here.

35:04.867 --> 35:06.367
Jessi, grant, and tory

35:06.368 --> 35:10.104
Are about to live out
their action-movie dreams.

35:10.105 --> 35:11.339
They want to know,

35:11.359 --> 35:15.442
A la hollywood,
can you hop into a helicopter?

35:15.443 --> 35:18.046
All right, so, this is what
I think should happen, guys.

35:18.047 --> 35:19.982
We hang on, but we can't
start doing any climbing

35:19.983 --> 35:21.483
Until we actually
hit the airstream.

35:21.484 --> 35:24.086
Well, then, the goal here is
to climb up onto the skid,

35:24.087 --> 35:25.688
Get yourself safely
inside the helicopter

35:25.689 --> 35:26.957
Without falling into the water.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.258
All right. So, who goes first?

35:28.259 --> 35:29.527
Not it. Not it.

35:29.528 --> 35:31.596
I gues.I'l go first! Ha ha!

35:31.597 --> 35:33.097
Don't tell her about the piranhas.

35:35.668 --> 35:37.535
I think I'm gonna do just fine.

35:37.536 --> 35:40.572
I got a good technique,
and it's gonna get me up and over.

35:40.573 --> 35:43.508
It's just those winds that
I'm quite curious about.

35:43.509 --> 35:47.512
Yep, and it's those
80-mile-an-hour winds,

35:47.513 --> 35:50.014
Simulating a helicopter's
cruising speed,

35:50.015 --> 35:52.918
And the accurate undercarriage
and skid structure

35:52.919 --> 35:56.856
That gives this test the
seal of authenticity.

35:56.857 --> 36:00.560
But none of that stops
stunt girl jessi.

36:00.561 --> 36:03.162
Yeah!

36:03.163 --> 36:06.866
She was slick, quick,
and her technique looked like

36:06.867 --> 36:10.171
It was straight out of
the stunt-girl manual.

36:10.172 --> 36:13.240
This is pretty large tubing,
so if you have little hands,

36:13.241 --> 36:14.876
It's gonna be
difficult to hang onto

36:14.877 --> 36:17.277
'cause I could feel myself
starting to kind of slide off.

36:17.278 --> 36:19.713
And then, once you
got into the wind,

36:19.714 --> 36:21.648
I was like, "the wds are insane!"

36:21.649 --> 36:24.450
My ponytail was sideways,
my pant leg has come undone,

36:24.451 --> 36:25.784
My shirt almost flew off.

36:25.785 --> 36:27.786
And, then, standing
up on the skid --

36:27.787 --> 36:30.889
It's a little bit more difficult
than you thought it would be,

36:30.890 --> 36:32.724
'cause you do have
those pressing winds.

36:32.725 --> 36:34.659
But once you're in, you're in.
You're safe.

36:34.660 --> 36:36.762
The key to jessi's
success was speed.

36:36.763 --> 36:38.196
And if you throw in the fact

36:38.197 --> 36:41.800
That this test is all about
strength-to-body-weight ratio,

36:41.801 --> 36:45.572
Being a lot lighter, she's got
a big advantage over the guys.

36:45.573 --> 36:47.741
So, will they be able to match her?

36:47.742 --> 36:49.042
All right. You ready?

36:52.247 --> 36:53.347
That was nuts!

36:53.348 --> 36:54.782
I was hanging onto the skid,

36:54.783 --> 36:57.218
And as I was going out, I was like,
"yeah, this is fine."

36:57.219 --> 36:58.920
And all of a sudden,
I hit that wind,

36:58.921 --> 37:01.822
And I was like,
"I'm not gonna make it.

37:01.823 --> 37:03.558
I'm gonna fall into the water."

37:05.094 --> 37:06.594
That was crazy!

37:06.595 --> 37:10.231
Crazy? Sure.
But also very achievable.

37:11.499 --> 37:12.733
Yeah!

37:12.734 --> 37:15.602
And with grant
scrambling for safety

37:15.603 --> 37:19.106
With just a wardrobe
malfunction to worry about...

37:19.107 --> 37:22.042
get to the chopper, grant!

37:22.043 --> 37:24.912
...The myth and the boys'
deluded silv-screen dreams

37:24.913 --> 37:25.914
Are looking good.

37:25.915 --> 37:28.216
Yeah!

37:28.217 --> 37:30.619
man! He wanted to live!

37:30.620 --> 37:32.655
Yeah!

37:32.656 --> 37:34.089
I'm alive!

37:34.090 --> 37:36.859
I made it to the chopper!

37:36.860 --> 37:38.327
Did you see his shirt come up?!

37:40.163 --> 37:42.697
Damn! Thank god his
pants didn't come off!

37:45.668 --> 37:47.569
take that, action heroes.

37:47.570 --> 37:49.004
That was such a fun test!

37:49.005 --> 37:51.106
And it's possible to
climb into a helicopter

37:51.107 --> 37:52.207
As it's taking off.

37:52.208 --> 37:53.842
Yeah, but it's
definitely not as easy

37:53.843 --> 37:55.343
As it looks in the action movies.

37:55.344 --> 37:56.644
Well, so far,

37:56.645 --> 37:58.913
All of these fall-guys' myths
are looking pretty good.

37:58.914 --> 38:00.181
You know what?

38:00.182 --> 38:02.283
I think we did pretty good
for a couple of average joes.

38:02.284 --> 38:03.551
Whoo!

38:05.787 --> 38:07.455
Next, in a tense finale...

38:07.456 --> 38:09.490
? dun dun duuun! ?

38:09.491 --> 38:12.626
...Adam and jamie ramp
it up with a can cannon.

38:12.627 --> 38:14.428
I call it my little "pop" gun.

38:20.860 --> 38:22.294
At this point, we've seen

38:22.295 --> 38:24.229
That while this might make
it through a windshield,

38:24.230 --> 38:26.432
If it does, it's not gonna
hit you hard enough to kilu,

38:26.433 --> 38:30.169
Which begs the question,
"what would?"

38:30.170 --> 38:31.871
That's where this comes in.

38:31.872 --> 38:36.810
Yep, the soda cup of slushie
will make a mess of your car...

38:36.811 --> 38:39.546
But smart, modern windshield design

38:39.547 --> 38:42.950
Will prevent it from
killing you directly.

38:42.951 --> 38:44.852
But can .Can of soda?

38:44.853 --> 38:46.554
Cue the tense music.

38:46.555 --> 38:48.156
? dun dun duuun! ?

38:48.157 --> 38:50.391
What's this aluminum soda
can full of soda gonna do

38:50.392 --> 38:51.559
When it hits this windshield?

38:51.560 --> 38:53.294
Well, I think we're
all in agreement

38:53.295 --> 38:54.529
That it's gonna go through.

38:54.530 --> 38:55.797
All right, james franklin hyneman,

38:55.798 --> 38:56.798
Are you ready?

38:56.799 --> 38:57.999
I'm ready.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.134
Let's go!

39:00.135 --> 39:01.936
The question is,
what will it do to <i>buster?</i>

39:01.937 --> 39:03.270
And I'll tell you --

39:03.271 --> 39:06.507
I'd be terrified to have this
go through my windshield.

39:06.508 --> 39:08.876
Another in a long
series of things --

39:08.877 --> 39:10.645
What the hell am I doing?

39:10.646 --> 39:15.950
"missing" is the short answer -
missing several times.

39:15.951 --> 39:18.953
And even the occasional
hit is a mis-hit.

39:20.622 --> 39:25.541
But, nothing, if not persistent,
our yodas of soda are.

39:25.940 --> 39:27.333
It's all down to this one.

39:27.858 --> 39:30.714
Will I make it?
Will I have the accuracy?

39:31.272 --> 39:32.519
Crap, I hope so.

39:34.623 --> 39:37.561
I think I hit it! A palpable hit!

39:37.812 --> 39:40.113
Finally, a hit on the windshield.

39:40.114 --> 39:43.149
But, adam, using the sporting
prowess he was born with --

39:43.150 --> 39:46.786
As in, none -
was wayward once again.

39:46.787 --> 39:48.989
A hit in the corner,
near the frame,

39:48.990 --> 39:51.658
Damaged the glass,
but didn't threaten buster.

39:51.659 --> 39:54.294
And with the team running
out of windshields,

39:54.295 --> 39:57.230
They need a more accurate
litter-launching method.

39:57.231 --> 39:59.399
Well, it's not a
perfectly centered hit,

39:59.400 --> 40:02.202
But jamie has, I think,
a solution that he says

40:02.203 --> 40:05.372
Is gonna be more accurate
than me throwing and hoping.

40:05.373 --> 40:08.074
I can't wait to see what it is.

40:08.075 --> 40:12.245
Back at the shop, while adam was
preparing the windshield rig,

40:12.246 --> 40:17.083
It looked and sounded
like jamie was having fun.

40:18.486 --> 40:21.021
did you hear that?

40:21.022 --> 40:23.757
That's the sound of mr.
Hyneman having fun.

40:23.758 --> 40:26.593
It's now clear what
he was working on.

40:26.594 --> 40:30.930
And it's a clear case of "
don't try this at home."

40:30.931 --> 40:33.233
It's pretty simple.

40:33.232 --> 40:34.412
We've got an air tank here,

40:34.412 --> 40:37.172
Which is a modified
fire extinguisher,

40:37.503 --> 40:41.078
A fast-acting valve,
an elbow, and a tube.

40:41.078 --> 40:44.325
And you put the soda in here
and you press the switch.

40:45.336 --> 40:46.551
Out comes the soda.

40:52.070 --> 40:52.934
Wow!

40:53.200 --> 40:55.185
I call it my little "pop" gun.

40:55.185 --> 40:56.727
That is awesome!

40:56.727 --> 40:58.044
Let's give it a shot.

40:58.044 --> 40:58.830
All right.

40:59.676 --> 41:03.462
Yep, in a strange mix of
"mad max" and "macgyver,"

41:03.462 --> 41:05.822
Jamie shoots at buster
with a can of soda

41:05.822 --> 41:08.078
From a shoulder-mounted
air cannon...

41:10.265 --> 41:13.032
...All in aid of accurately
hitting the target,

41:13.032 --> 41:15.664
Which doesn't happen
on the first go.

41:15.664 --> 41:16.641
Ho-ho!

41:16.641 --> 41:19.512
Well, that's a neat hole,
but I need to hit the dude.

41:19.512 --> 41:20.744
Yeah, you want to go again?

41:20.744 --> 41:24.152
Again, they go. But again, no dice.

41:24.617 --> 41:28.087
A direct hit, but still
didn't hit the dude.

41:30.587 --> 41:34.675
Once again, buster sees soda
and shrapnel fly past his ears.

41:34.674 --> 41:37.744
And as this is the team's
last piece of glass,

41:37.744 --> 41:39.447
It's back to basics.

41:39.447 --> 41:41.325
Looks like the only
thing left to do

41:41.325 --> 41:43.582
Is just shoot the
sucker point-blank.

41:44.655 --> 41:46.581
I'm actually kind of curious
how this is gonna turn out.

41:46.581 --> 41:47.773
yeah, me too.

41:48.116 --> 41:51.140
Little pop gun in three...

41:51.140 --> 41:52.403
Two...

41:52.403 --> 41:53.371
One.

41:55.968 --> 41:56.895
Wow!

41:56.895 --> 42:00.243
"wow?" yeah. Not to mention "ow."

42:00.243 --> 42:01.074
It killed him.

42:01.074 --> 42:04.154
It tripped all the shockwatch
stickers in his chest.

42:05.077 --> 42:06.495
Is this awesome or what?

42:06.495 --> 42:09.234
We tripped all three of
buster's shockwatch stickers,

42:09.234 --> 42:11.337
Which tells us something
that we often learn

42:11.337 --> 42:12.801
At the end of an episode of "
mythbusters."

42:12.801 --> 42:15.375
Everyday objects can,
in fact, be made lethal

42:15.375 --> 42:16.990
If jamie builds a
gun to shoot them.

42:19.421 --> 42:21.557
Obviously, if somebody
makes a cannon

42:21.557 --> 42:25.348
And fires a soda at you point-blank,
like I just did,

42:25.809 --> 42:26.709
You're gonna die.

42:27.001 --> 42:30.535
But a soda thrown out of
another car into your car?

42:31.822 --> 42:35.231
Well, unless you crash
the car because of it...

42:35.862 --> 42:37.210
Not so much.

42:37.393 --> 42:38.726
Well, where does that leave us?

42:38.725 --> 42:41.672
Well, we were able to
create a lethal beverage.

42:41.672 --> 42:43.887
Yeah, but it was a can, not a cup,

42:43.887 --> 42:46.986
And we did that at
point-blank range.

42:46.986 --> 42:47.970
Od point.

42:47.969 --> 42:50.347
But I have to say that the
styrofoam-cup beverage,

42:50.347 --> 42:52.372
While it would do a lot of
damage to your windshield,

42:52.372 --> 42:55.079
It's not, at a primary
level, lethal.

42:55.079 --> 42:56.448
That one is totally buste

42:56.636 --> 42:57.645
Yeah. It's busted.

42:57.902 --> 42:58.921
Our work here is done.

42:59.281 --> 42:59.955
Okay.

43:06.121 --> 43:08.840
Nice gun, but you got
some accuracy problems.

43:08.840 --> 43:10.367
Yeah, I need to practice.
