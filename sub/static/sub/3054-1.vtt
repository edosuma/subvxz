01:37.398 --> 01:38.597
Santa?

01:38.599 --> 01:40.132
Ahh!

01:40.134 --> 01:42.000
Holy crap, Boyd.

01:42.002 --> 01:44.236
What the hell you doing
back there, buddy?

01:44.238 --> 01:45.804
Waiting on Santa Claus?

01:45.806 --> 01:48.240
Aren't you getting
a little old for Santa Claus?

01:48.242 --> 01:49.575
I'm five.

01:49.577 --> 01:52.344
It's all a sham, Boyd.
The whole Goddamn deal.

01:52.346 --> 01:54.913
I'm the only Santa
you're ever gonna know.

01:54.915 --> 01:58.183
If you know the truth,
it's easy to get through it all.

01:58.185 --> 02:00.853
In fact, let's see
what he brought you.

02:00.855 --> 02:04.056
<i>- Meet my father,
- Mitch Mitchler.</i>

02:04.058 --> 02:06.892
All we need is
a couple of Chinese workers.

02:06.894 --> 02:09.261
<i>He was a little
bit complicated.</i>

02:19.073 --> 02:22.975
<i>Maybe I was destined to become
an overcompensator as a dad,</i>

02:22.977 --> 02:26.979
<i>Christmas being the most
obvious manifestation of that.</i>

02:26.981 --> 02:29.141
Alright, here we go.
Okay, lean in, everyone.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.750
<i>I'm also a realist.</i>

02:31.752 --> 02:34.353
<i>I can't control everything...
the weather, for instance.</i>

02:34.355 --> 02:36.155
Look Dad, it's snowing!

02:36.157 --> 02:38.357
Well, Bug,
that's actually fake snow.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.092
Because of global warming.

02:40.094 --> 02:42.060
<i>The warmest winter
on record in the Midwest</i>

02:42.062 --> 02:44.963
<i>assured a non-white Christmas.</i>

02:44.965 --> 02:48.800
<i>The bigger issue by far,
was the Santa conundrum.</i>

02:48.802 --> 02:51.837
<i>Vera was very much on
the fence, Santa-wise.</i>

02:51.839 --> 02:54.673
<i>But Douglas still believed.</i>

02:54.675 --> 02:55.974
Dad, why are there two Santas?

02:55.976 --> 02:57.376
<i>But for how much longer?</i>

02:57.378 --> 02:58.911
That guy's not Santa, Bug.

02:58.913 --> 03:00.512
He probably smells
like pee and burnt hair

03:00.514 --> 03:01.914
because he's a welfare person.

03:01.916 --> 03:02.948
Vera!

03:02.950 --> 03:04.416
Santa's not real anyway.

03:05.452 --> 03:07.286
Santa's not real, Dad?

03:07.288 --> 03:09.621
Of course Santa's real.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.823
No one's not real.

03:11.825 --> 03:14.927
Everyone's real,
including Santa.

03:18.364 --> 03:20.265
Vera, a word please.

03:20.267 --> 03:23.101
Whatever you think you know,
Vera, you don't.

03:23.103 --> 03:25.370
Most kids in my class
don't believe in Santa anymore.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.673
But Madison and me...
I mean Madison and I,

03:27.675 --> 03:31.276
we kinda still did,
except that Madison's sister,

03:31.278 --> 03:34.980
the one who did
the BJ to this kid...

03:34.982 --> 03:37.282
Uh, Vera, you don't
actually know what the B...

03:37.284 --> 03:40.252
what that expression
means, do you?

03:40.254 --> 03:41.954
It stands for butt jam,
and I think it has to do

03:41.956 --> 03:44.056
with jamming stuff
up your butt for money,

03:44.058 --> 03:45.424
but anyway,
Madison's sister,

03:45.426 --> 03:47.693
she showed us this website,
nosanta.org.

03:47.695 --> 03:50.062
Well, Madison's sister is
a deceitful little strumpet.

03:50.064 --> 03:51.897
What Dad means
is that it's okay

03:51.899 --> 03:54.633
for you to decide
about Santa, but Douglas...

03:54.635 --> 03:56.969
He absolutely believes.

03:56.971 --> 03:58.136
And we won't want to
do anything

03:58.138 --> 04:00.105
to spoil Christmas
for him, right?

04:00.107 --> 04:03.141
Oh, right,
I won't spoil it for Bug, Dad.

04:03.143 --> 04:04.476
Sorry.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.478
Thank you.

04:10.516 --> 04:13.385
You are a very kind
and generous young man.

04:13.387 --> 04:16.688
And you are going
to have a very merry

04:16.690 --> 04:19.658
and special Christmas.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.860
Oh ho ho ho!

04:29.002 --> 04:31.270
Hey, you wanna...

04:33.407 --> 04:36.408
I wasn't gonna ask
if you wanna smoke meth

04:36.410 --> 04:38.210
or kill a drifter.

04:38.212 --> 04:40.779
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.448
I just... I'm exhausted.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.483
I'm with you.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.084
I just thought I should ask.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.220
One day we're
gonna have to, right?

04:48.222 --> 04:51.823
Or, we could just enjoy
the slow descent into celibacy.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.298
How many years
do you think Bug has left

04:59.300 --> 05:03.902
where he walks into the
living room Christmas morning,

05:03.904 --> 05:06.705
he sees the tree,

05:06.707 --> 05:09.107
and presents,
his stomach just drops,

05:10.276 --> 05:13.278
because holy crap, Santa came?

05:15.848 --> 05:20.452
Can you imagine still having
that kind of belief in magic?

05:21.454 --> 05:25.123
Yeah, it's really cool.

05:25.125 --> 05:29.094
Do you think
you're overcompensating

05:29.096 --> 05:31.096
on the Christmas
thing, just a tad?

05:31.098 --> 05:33.198
Overcompens...
on the Christmas thing?

05:33.200 --> 05:35.133
No! I don't think that
at all.

05:35.135 --> 05:36.401
He's six years old.

05:36.403 --> 05:38.337
Okay, this is
your brother, again.

05:38.339 --> 05:39.805
Pass.

05:39.807 --> 05:42.007
You can't keep pretending
your family doesn't exist.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.242
I'm pretty sure I can.

05:44.244 --> 05:46.945
Come on babe, take the call,
before it wakes the kids up.

05:49.749 --> 05:51.483
Hi, Nelson.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.652
- Whoa, that is spooky.
- How'd you know it was me?

05:53.654 --> 05:55.887
<i>We have caller ID,
so your number comes up.</i>

05:55.889 --> 05:58.290
Just right there on the phone?

05:58.292 --> 06:00.292
Boy, that is something.
I gotta look into that.

06:00.294 --> 06:01.893
You know, that's
a miracle of science.

06:01.895 --> 06:02.895
<i>Yeah, you bet.</i>

06:02.896 --> 06:05.364
Hold on one sec, Boyd.

06:07.267 --> 06:09.768
Sorry to call you
so late by the way.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.503
Is it night time
where you are, too?

06:11.505 --> 06:13.805
No, it's 10 here too,
because Chicago and Wisconsin-

06:13.807 --> 06:17.142
What is in the same time zone!

06:17.144 --> 06:19.444
Yeah, we're in
the same time zone.

06:19.446 --> 06:23.281
I don't know if you caught
that, I said it like Jeopardy.

06:23.283 --> 06:24.583
<i>So anyway.</i>

06:24.585 --> 06:27.052
Oh, oh, right. So anyway,
I'm calling to tell you:

06:27.054 --> 06:30.355
I scored myself a kid,
a little boy. I'm a dad.

06:30.357 --> 06:31.757
Really?

06:31.759 --> 06:32.924
He seems to have procreated.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.192
Eeww.

06:34.194 --> 06:36.728
I was calling to say,

06:36.730 --> 06:38.263
I want you to be the godfather.

06:38.265 --> 06:40.899
Really?
We would be honoured.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.601
That is just the best, Boyd.

06:42.603 --> 06:45.337
Jeez, that is so...
I know it's short notice

06:45.339 --> 06:47.472
but the baptism's on the 24th.

06:47.474 --> 06:49.775
<i>Oh, absolutely. We wouldn't
miss it for the world.</i>

06:49.777 --> 06:50.842
Sweet.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.344
Uh, January or February?

06:52.346 --> 06:54.312
No Boyd, December.
December 24th.

06:54.314 --> 06:55.680
Oh, you can't wait for it.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.282
December? What?

06:57.284 --> 07:01.853
Nelson, you can't have a baptism
on Christmas Eve.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.722
It doesn't...

07:03.724 --> 07:06.224
Wait that would mean

07:06.226 --> 07:10.262
that I'd have to spend
Christmas with Dad.

07:10.264 --> 07:12.631
I'll smoke in my Goddamn
house if I want to.

07:12.633 --> 07:15.834
It's my house. Name's right
there on the mortgage.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.702
Right there on the mailbox.

07:17.704 --> 07:19.237
His name on the mortgage, Donna?

07:19.239 --> 07:21.039
His name
on the friggin' mailbox?

07:21.041 --> 07:23.575
No sir, it is not,
didn't think so.

07:23.577 --> 07:26.711
Ipso facto ergo,
not his Goddamn house.

07:26.713 --> 07:27.913
Jeezo!

07:27.915 --> 07:29.848
Man you exhaust me, Mitch.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.616
You know it is
a dream come true for me

07:31.618 --> 07:34.186
to have my family
home on Christmas.

07:34.188 --> 07:36.455
There's no way they were
gonna get a motel room now

07:36.457 --> 07:38.723
at this late date,
and with Boyd's asthma...

07:38.725 --> 07:40.859
Asthma?
Any other restrictions

07:40.861 --> 07:42.427
Captain Wheezy
wants to put on me?

07:42.429 --> 07:45.397
Well, there is one more thing.

07:46.766 --> 07:49.034
I was planning on doing venison
for Christmas Eve supper,

07:49.036 --> 07:51.670
but apparently, Boyd's
family doesn't eat red meat

07:51.672 --> 07:52.737
and I was...

07:52.739 --> 07:55.340
Christ's sake!

08:11.824 --> 08:13.725
Is that all of Douglas' stuff?

08:13.727 --> 08:15.093
Si. What about Vera's?

08:15.095 --> 08:16.761
I hid it
in the car this morning.

08:16.763 --> 08:17.863
Oh, you're aces!

08:17.865 --> 08:19.764
Tu tambien!

08:19.766 --> 08:21.766
So, you ready to see your dad?

08:21.768 --> 08:24.536
Yeah, can't wait. I'm
actually looking forward to it.

08:24.538 --> 08:25.837
Really?

08:25.839 --> 08:28.340
No, I'd rather be
sodomized by an angry clown!

08:28.342 --> 08:31.476
I just want the kids
to have a good Christmas.

08:31.478 --> 08:32.577
Me, too.

08:32.578 --> 08:33.912
Dad?

08:33.914 --> 08:35.647
Hey, hi, what are you doing?

08:35.649 --> 08:36.815
Hi, Dougie doodle.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.750
Who's gonna feed
Dale while we're gone?

08:38.751 --> 08:40.784
Oh, that would be...
Farhad.

08:40.787 --> 08:41.787
Who's Farhad?

08:41.788 --> 08:42.888
Mom's ESL student.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.256
What's ESL?

08:44.258 --> 08:46.291
Remember, English
as a second language?

08:46.293 --> 08:48.493
Why don't you tell him, Dad?
I'll race you upstairs.

08:58.371 --> 09:02.574
¶ Jingle bells, jingle
bells, jingle all the way ¶

09:02.576 --> 09:07.112
¶ Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh ¶

09:07.114 --> 09:09.915
¶ Dashing through the snow ¶

09:09.917 --> 09:12.317
¶ In a one-horse open sleigh ¶

09:12.319 --> 09:14.619
¶ O'er the fields we go ¶

09:14.621 --> 09:16.955
¶ Laughing all the way ¶

09:16.957 --> 09:19.257
¶ Bells on Bobtail ring ¶

09:19.259 --> 09:21.226
¶ Making spirits bright ¶

09:24.864 --> 09:26.231
Son of a bitch.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.832
Mom, Dad said "bitch."

09:27.834 --> 09:30.569
Bitch is a bad word, Bug.
You can use bastard or ass.

09:30.571 --> 09:31.603
Hey, you guys, come on.

09:38.878 --> 09:40.278
Hey, we're twins!

09:40.280 --> 09:43.448
Ha ha ha, merry Christmas!

09:43.450 --> 09:45.584
Licence and proof
of insurance, please.

09:46.986 --> 09:48.520
Awesome.

09:48.522 --> 09:52.591
So, I did clock you doing
67 in a 45, Mr. Mitchler.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.492
Yeah, the bum deal
about that is,

09:54.494 --> 09:58.496
it's a 450-dollar infraction,
but there is some good news.

09:58.498 --> 10:01.566
You can pay online now,
in the state of Wisconsin.

10:01.568 --> 10:03.902
Yeah, it's a real sweet
website, takes Discover,

10:03.904 --> 10:08.807
so you get the cash back
which, you know, helps out.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.942
Alright, kids,
hope Santa treats you good!

10:10.944 --> 10:12.444
Take care! Merry Christmas!

10:12.446 --> 10:15.080
Merry Christmas.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.749
You bet.

10:21.187 --> 10:23.822
Oh, where the heck
can they be?

10:23.824 --> 10:25.890
Oh, don't get
your knickers in a knot.

10:25.892 --> 10:27.158
You having a good time, Dad?

10:27.160 --> 10:28.927
Oh yeah, I'm delirious.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.929
I want some milk.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.031
You have to wait 'til supper
like the rest of us, Cale.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.366
Where is the sex offender?

10:34.368 --> 10:36.568
He's not a sex offender!

10:36.570 --> 10:39.571
What should I call him
then, Willy Wanker?

10:39.573 --> 10:41.573
With the help of
our marriage counsellor,

10:41.575 --> 10:44.542
me and Dave have worked
through his transgressions.

10:44.544 --> 10:48.680
So my husband, Dad,
is outside smoking a heater.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.328
Dad, Rance is being a gomer!

11:03.330 --> 11:05.296
Hey you guys, cut it out!

11:05.298 --> 11:06.931
Where the hell did you
get that thing from?

11:06.933 --> 11:08.500
I took it.

11:08.502 --> 11:10.862
Well, put it the hell back
from where you took it from!

11:15.841 --> 11:17.409
Thank you.

11:17.411 --> 11:20.578
Aw, crud,
I can't find my camera.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.213
Mitch, go look for it,
will you?

11:22.215 --> 11:24.115
For cripe's sake,
we're not National Geographic.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.617
They're not some
bunch of bonobos.

11:25.619 --> 11:28.353
Mitch, they have never
been here for Christmas.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.088
Well, whose fault
is that? Not mine.

11:30.090 --> 11:31.656
Boyd's the one who thinks
he's too good for us.

11:31.658 --> 11:34.359
Having my family here
means everything to me.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.028
So quit being such an a-hole,

11:37.030 --> 11:39.397
and go look for my G-D camera!

11:40.800 --> 11:44.502
They're here!

11:44.504 --> 11:46.705
Shut up, tramp stamp!

11:48.541 --> 11:51.076
Mitch, hurry up, Boyd's here.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.844
Boyd!

11:52.846 --> 11:54.145
Hey!
Oh, honey!

11:54.147 --> 11:55.680
Mom!

11:55.682 --> 11:57.282
I love you.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.517
I love you.
It's great to be home.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.653
You are looking fine as wine.

12:01.655 --> 12:04.456
Can you believe it, Boyd,
all of us together at Christmas!

12:04.458 --> 12:06.524
I know, it's great.
Well, where's the Nel?

12:06.526 --> 12:08.793
Nelson and the baby
are meeting us at church.

12:08.795 --> 12:10.028
Gotcha.

12:10.030 --> 12:13.098
Isn't this perfect,
Boyd? This is perfect.

12:19.038 --> 12:21.139
Stop! Don't hurt me!

12:21.141 --> 12:22.607
Don't... don't...

12:28.582 --> 12:30.949
Dad, you okay?

12:30.951 --> 12:32.517
I'm fine.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.586
You're welcome,
anytime. You're family.

12:40.025 --> 12:43.261
You okay?

12:43.263 --> 12:44.662
Puba!

12:44.664 --> 12:46.865
Dougie Doodle!
How are you, little bugger?

12:46.867 --> 12:49.801
Everybody get together
for a quick photo,

12:49.803 --> 12:52.270
and then we gotta
get ready for church.

12:52.272 --> 12:56.274
¶ That glorious song of old ¶

12:57.409 --> 13:02.614
¶ From angels bending
near the earth ¶

13:03.516 --> 13:08.319
¶ To touch their harps of gold ¶

13:10.991 --> 13:15.794
¶ ...goodwill to men from
heavens all gracious king ¶

13:16.996 --> 13:21.166
¶ I really don't
know the words to say ¶

13:21.168 --> 13:26.371
¶ So now I don't have to sing ¶

13:29.241 --> 13:34.445
Uh, well, of course most of
you remember my wife, Cindy,

13:34.447 --> 13:36.948
and might have known
that when I was in basic,

13:36.950 --> 13:40.919
over by Fort Digs, she ran
off with this Mexican guy,

13:40.921 --> 13:43.822
who played a little minor
league ball for the Wombats.

13:43.824 --> 13:47.025
Uh, pretty halfway
decent shortstop.

13:47.027 --> 13:50.195
Anyhow, he got her pregnant,
this Mexican guy did,

13:50.197 --> 13:53.531
so Cindy comes by
the house one day, and goes,

13:53.533 --> 13:55.266
"Hey Nelson,
would you mind

13:55.268 --> 13:57.569
"looking after the baby
for a while?"

13:57.571 --> 14:00.638
And I said,
"Yeah, yeah sure, no sweat."

14:00.640 --> 14:02.240
And anyhow, that was
six months ago

14:02.242 --> 14:04.642
and I still got
this kid of hers, so.

14:04.644 --> 14:07.579
He don't have
a name that I know of,

14:07.581 --> 14:09.514
so I've just been
calling him Baby.

14:09.516 --> 14:12.517
But you know, he is
a real, real good boy.

14:12.519 --> 14:15.987
And uh, that's why
I want to name him Boyd,

14:15.989 --> 14:17.455
after my own big brother,

14:17.457 --> 14:20.758
who is just
a heck of a good guy himself.

14:20.760 --> 14:23.595
So, I am presenting
Boyd Jr.

14:23.597 --> 14:27.799
as a candidate
for holy baptism.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.372
Except I figure
I'm gonna call him BJ.

14:37.243 --> 14:39.577
Welcome to the family, BJ.

14:39.579 --> 14:42.280
Dear God,
I look around this table,

14:42.282 --> 14:44.115
and I see a family.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.516
I know we're not perfect,
Lord God,

14:45.518 --> 14:48.319
even though some people
think they are.

14:48.321 --> 14:53.191
We've all got foibles,
peccadilloes if you will.

14:53.193 --> 14:56.327
I'm not gonna name names, Dave;
it's not the time or the place.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.830
Anyhow I just want to
say, thank you, Lord Jesus,

14:58.832 --> 15:01.733
Lamb of God, for bringing
us together here.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.434
And now each one of us
is gonna say something

15:03.436 --> 15:05.904
they're thankful for.
Donna, do it.

15:05.906 --> 15:07.772
Oh, uh,

15:07.774 --> 15:11.476
I'm thankful little
BJ's christening went okay.

15:12.778 --> 15:16.114
But mostly I'm thankful
we're all here together.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.849
That's a dream for me.

15:17.851 --> 15:18.950
Skol.

15:18.952 --> 15:20.885
Skol!

15:20.887 --> 15:22.520
It's a prayer Donna,
not a toast, come on.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.489
Shauna, you're up.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.257
Oh. Uh, I'm grateful

15:26.259 --> 15:30.528
that through the grace
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

15:30.530 --> 15:32.997
I'm able to forgive all of you

15:32.999 --> 15:35.099
for all the pain
you've caused me,

15:35.101 --> 15:38.536
and, thanks to me and
Dave's marriage counsellor,

15:38.538 --> 15:41.272
uh, we are back
on the marriage train,

15:41.274 --> 15:45.143
and we are gonna ride it all
the way into the station.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.511
Right?

15:47.781 --> 15:49.614
Well, I got one.

15:49.616 --> 15:50.915
I thank God that
he gave me the ability

15:50.917 --> 15:52.784
to give 110 percent,
and take first

15:52.786 --> 15:54.352
for the WISEA
under-fourteen regionals.

15:54.354 --> 15:58.623
WISEA stands for Wisconsin
Competitive Eating Association.

15:58.625 --> 16:03.428
Rancer ate 27 Johnsonville
brats in five minutes.

16:03.430 --> 16:06.064
- That's a lot of brats.
- Way to go, Rance.

16:09.035 --> 16:10.902
That is... uh,
that is really neat.

16:10.904 --> 16:13.271
Let's give it the devil, Rancer.
Come on, pound these back.

16:13.273 --> 16:14.706
Go, Rancer!

16:14.708 --> 16:16.507
Go, go, go, Rancer!

16:16.509 --> 16:20.278
Get it. Go-o-o, Rancer.
Go, go, go, Rancer.

16:30.056 --> 16:33.391
That's what I'm talking about!
Come on!

16:33.393 --> 16:35.960
Wow, that is
really, really neat.

16:35.962 --> 16:37.895
How many hot dogs
can you eat, Dougie doodle?

16:37.897 --> 16:39.797
We're not allowed
to eat hot dogs.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.733
We're a macrobiotic household.

16:41.735 --> 16:43.801
For crying out loud,
Boyd, what's this crap?

16:43.803 --> 16:45.403
You're gonna turn your kids
into a couple of beatniks.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.071
Our kids are fine!

16:47.073 --> 16:49.140
- I know they're fine.
- I'm just saying,

16:49.142 --> 16:50.675
you don't want your boy
to turn into a Sally, do ya?

16:50.677 --> 16:52.110
Don't tell me
how to raise my kids.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.212
Don't tell me
what to do in my house!

16:54.214 --> 16:57.115
Is your name on the mailbox?!
I didn't think so!

16:57.117 --> 16:58.950
Oh really,
the mailbox line again, Dad?

16:58.952 --> 17:01.786
Great, you sparked
Nelson's PTSD.

17:01.788 --> 17:05.156
Post-traumatic
stress disorder.

17:05.157 --> 17:08.726
When things get tense,
Nelly gets a little squirrely.

17:08.728 --> 17:12.296
He has to go into
a dark, quiet space.

17:12.298 --> 17:15.299
It's from the war.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.001
What war, Mom?

17:17.002 --> 17:18.569
He fell out of
the back of a Humvee

17:18.570 --> 17:19.936
during basic training
and was discharged.

17:19.939 --> 17:22.140
A head injury!

17:23.275 --> 17:25.777
He got a head injury
serving his country!

17:30.716 --> 17:32.917
Okay.

17:37.656 --> 17:40.391
Mmm! What...

17:40.393 --> 17:43.995
Why are there shotgun
pellets in my chicken?

17:45.064 --> 17:46.664
Dad.

17:48.300 --> 17:50.001
Because it's squirrel.

17:59.511 --> 18:00.878
Honey, no, we're not leaving.

18:00.880 --> 18:04.582
He fed me a rodent
for Christmas dinner.

18:06.418 --> 18:07.885
Well, you're the only
one who ate squirrel.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.854
Ours was really chicken.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.355
You did say that
you could handle anything

18:11.357 --> 18:13.257
as long as the kids
were having a good Christmas,

18:13.259 --> 18:15.827
and the kids are having
a great Christmas.

18:18.297 --> 18:22.366
Think you can just flex
those emotional muscles,

18:22.368 --> 18:25.303
just a little bit,
and think of Douglas?

18:30.008 --> 18:32.710
I want some more dessert!

18:42.354 --> 18:44.655
And that's how
you make 50 dollars an hour.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.090
Puba?

18:46.092 --> 18:47.092
Yeah, Dougie?

18:47.093 --> 18:48.726
I want us to leave Santa
a snack,

18:48.728 --> 18:51.262
but Rance ate all the cookies
in like, 10 seconds,

18:51.264 --> 18:53.264
and then he drank
a whole gallon of milk.

18:53.266 --> 18:54.799
Whoa.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.435
So, I was wondering
if you had anything else

18:57.437 --> 18:59.403
that I could give to Santa?

19:01.607 --> 19:03.608
Of course I do, Bug.

19:03.610 --> 19:04.742
I know something
that Santa loves

19:04.744 --> 19:06.944
a lot more
than milk and cookies.

19:11.283 --> 19:13.818
Dear Santa, Puba said you
would enjoy this bourbon

19:13.820 --> 19:16.754
and asparagus.
I hope you like it a lot.

19:16.756 --> 19:19.524
Love, your very good
friend, Douglas Mitchler.

19:19.526 --> 19:23.227
¶ Shake that ass, bitch,
and let me see what you got ¶

19:23.229 --> 19:26.864
¶ Shake that ass, bitch,
and let me see what you got ¶

19:26.866 --> 19:29.066
¶ Shake that ass, bitch,
and let me see what you got ¶

19:29.068 --> 19:32.003
Whoa, that's pretty neat, Pam.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.138
I know, I've got
over 75 hits so far.

19:34.140 --> 19:36.841
Your average is zero stars
'cause you suck, turdbait.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.976
Shut up, jackwipe!

19:41.381 --> 19:43.714
Hey, that's not very
Christmassy behaviour.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.183
Gather up.

19:47.186 --> 19:51.255
So, we have a tradition
in our family

19:51.257 --> 19:54.792
where we read
<i>The Night Before Christmas</i>

19:54.794 --> 19:58.329
the night before Christmas.
Get it?

19:59.365 --> 20:00.965
This is mentally challenged.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.767
Do you think
this is a joke, Rance?

20:02.769 --> 20:04.869
This isn't a joke.
This is Christmas.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.871
We're not two, Uncle Boyd!

20:06.873 --> 20:09.540
I mean, all this
Santa crap is for babies!

20:09.542 --> 20:11.509
Every dumbass knows
there's no such thing!

20:11.511 --> 20:12.843
Shut up!

20:12.845 --> 20:15.446
Shut your mouth!
Shut your big, eating mouth!

20:15.448 --> 20:16.914
Right now, shut it!

20:20.185 --> 20:23.421
Santa will find
me here, right Dad?

20:23.423 --> 20:25.356
Of course he will, Bug.

20:25.358 --> 20:27.225
In fact, Santa
just texted me to say

20:27.227 --> 20:30.728
that he made you
an amazing present!

20:30.730 --> 20:33.798
But you're gonna have to wait
until morning to see it.

20:37.202 --> 20:38.903
Okay.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.572
- Look at this pile of crap.
- This country's so damn excessive

20:41.574 --> 20:43.074
it makes me wanna puke.

20:43.076 --> 20:45.743
Oh put a sock in it,
Mitchler.

20:46.778 --> 20:48.012
Well, they're all down.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.280
Oh that's super, honey.

20:49.282 --> 20:51.282
Good job.

20:52.884 --> 20:54.619
Where's Douglas' stuff?

20:54.621 --> 20:57.021
Oh gosh, buried
in there somewhere.

21:03.562 --> 21:05.730
Everything's out of the car?

21:05.732 --> 21:07.531
I got the last
of it out of there.

21:07.533 --> 21:09.166
Well, none of it's here.

21:09.168 --> 21:14.138
None of Douglas'
presents are here.

21:20.579 --> 21:21.812
No, that's impossible.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.648
You put them in the car
this morning.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.116
I didn't, you did.

21:25.118 --> 21:26.651
No, you gave me the thumbs up!

21:26.653 --> 21:28.552
Meaning you do it,
and you nodded!

21:28.554 --> 21:30.621
Wait, what are you two saying?

21:30.623 --> 21:31.922
Boyd...

21:31.924 --> 21:33.457
Not Boyd, Luann!

21:33.459 --> 21:36.560
Boyd and I left all of
Douglas' stuff in Chicago.

21:36.562 --> 21:38.362
Oh, jeez.

21:38.364 --> 21:41.299
- It's gonna be fine!
- We'll think of something!

21:41.301 --> 21:43.067
Right?

21:43.069 --> 21:46.570
Uh, oh I have an idea.
Uh, what's it called, Toys "R"...

21:46.572 --> 21:48.139
Us.

21:48.141 --> 21:50.574
Babe, the mall closes at six,
all right?

21:50.576 --> 21:52.109
Just sit there and look pretty.

21:52.111 --> 21:54.312
Okay, listen, Randy Sickle
over there in Commercial,

21:54.314 --> 21:55.946
they're open 24 hours,
we'll go over there,

21:55.948 --> 21:57.315
pick him up maybe one of
those singing bass plaques

21:57.317 --> 21:58.816
and a mesh hat.

21:58.818 --> 22:01.218
Hey, come on, he's seven. Throw
in a pack of grape hike shoes

22:01.220 --> 22:03.888
boom,
it's done. What do you say?

22:03.890 --> 22:06.490
The kid's never gonna know the
difference. "Christmas, hey!"

22:06.492 --> 22:09.560
That's exactly
what you would do!

22:09.562 --> 22:11.195
Nice parenting, really nice!

22:11.197 --> 22:13.264
Last time I checked, it
ain't exactly great parenting

22:13.266 --> 22:16.200
ruining your kid's
Christmas, Prime Time!

22:16.202 --> 22:18.169
I should knock
you on your ass.

22:18.171 --> 22:20.338
Oh really? Bring it Sally!
I'd love to see you try!

22:20.340 --> 22:21.539
Come on!

22:25.611 --> 22:27.511
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

22:27.513 --> 22:30.014
Now if we're gonna do this,

22:30.016 --> 22:31.682
we're gonna need
some ground rules.

22:31.684 --> 22:34.218
I'm going. I'm driving back.
It's not even 11.

22:34.220 --> 22:35.920
That gives me eight hours
until he's up. I'm going.

22:35.922 --> 22:37.421
Boyd, don't go!

22:37.423 --> 22:39.490
You can't do it,
it's too far!

22:39.492 --> 22:42.293
He's not going anywhere,
Donna, he's all show and no go.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.766
Boyd. Boyd, stop.

22:48.768 --> 22:51.736
You've had four hours of sleep.
You're gonna kill yourself!

22:51.738 --> 22:54.638
Any day now,
Douglas is gonna wake up

22:54.640 --> 22:57.108
and realize the world
is a mean, nasty place

22:57.110 --> 22:58.676
where your hopes and dreams

22:58.678 --> 23:01.912
eventually get smashed to bits.
Until then, he needs this.

23:01.914 --> 23:03.714
I'm sorry, who needs this?

23:03.716 --> 23:08.252
If I can just make him
believe for one more Christmas.

23:08.254 --> 23:10.888
Having Christmas
is not about stuff, Boyd.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.656
Look, just wait.
Okay, go tomorrow,

23:12.658 --> 23:14.425
when you've had some sleep.

23:14.427 --> 23:16.827
We'll say that
we delayed Christmas a day.

23:16.829 --> 23:19.096
We'll make it fun.

23:19.098 --> 23:22.400
I understand. Mitch
ruined Christmas for you,

23:22.402 --> 23:25.903
but you have proven
a million times over,

23:25.905 --> 23:28.706
you're not him.
You're such a great dad.

23:28.708 --> 23:31.108
This is just crazy!

23:32.310 --> 23:33.611
Hey, hey.

23:33.613 --> 23:36.013
Look, you're running away
from your father again!

23:36.015 --> 23:37.915
You can't keep doing this!

23:37.917 --> 23:40.551
- Boyd, wait, I'm coming with you!
- Let me just put up some coffee!

23:40.553 --> 23:43.120
It's about
an eight-hour round trip,

23:43.122 --> 23:46.223
which gets me back
here at what, sevenish,

23:46.225 --> 23:50.094
so just make sure the kids
stay downstairs until 7:30.

23:50.096 --> 23:51.562
This is doable,
but I gotta go now.

23:51.564 --> 23:53.564
Be careful, honey!

24:02.808 --> 24:04.842
Merry Christmas.

24:31.570 --> 24:34.104
I made this ornament
when I was a kid once,

24:34.106 --> 24:37.541
out of a pine cone.

24:37.543 --> 24:39.777
It had the googly eyes on it
and the white cotton deals,

24:39.779 --> 24:41.011
you know
what I'm talking about?

24:41.013 --> 24:42.480
Shut the hell
up, you degenerate.

24:42.482 --> 24:43.280
Pervert.

24:43.282 --> 24:44.949
He's not a pervert!

24:44.951 --> 24:47.751
A guy who exposes himself
to a busload of old folks

24:47.753 --> 24:49.153
on their way to Oneida bingo,

24:49.155 --> 24:50.654
what the hell should I call him
if not pervert?

24:50.656 --> 24:52.323
Friggin' pillar
of the community?

24:52.325 --> 24:54.558
I have explained this situation
to you a hundred times.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.527
In Dave's defence,
he was drunk!

24:56.529 --> 24:57.328
Very!

24:57.330 --> 24:58.829
And in his second defence,

24:58.831 --> 25:01.765
someone double-dog dared him
to do it, so that...

25:01.767 --> 25:05.169
Okay. Who wants to look at
some slides? Or, I know,

25:05.171 --> 25:06.971
how about a game of cribbage?

25:08.241 --> 25:10.107
Oh, I've got that.

25:11.910 --> 25:13.410
Hello?

25:13.412 --> 25:15.179
- Is it him?
- Is he okay? What happened?

25:15.181 --> 25:18.148
He's fine, but...
Aw crud.

25:20.886 --> 25:23.087
Dammit.

25:37.802 --> 25:40.104
Looky here. BMW.

25:40.106 --> 25:43.574
Short for
Bavarian Money Waster.

25:43.576 --> 25:45.376
Looks like the sheisse
hit the fan here.

25:45.378 --> 25:46.810
I'm gonna hitchhike.
Really?

25:46.812 --> 25:48.679
Christmas Eve,
no one's gonna pick you up.

25:48.681 --> 25:49.813
Come on, let's go.

25:49.815 --> 25:51.382
I'm not giving up.

25:51.384 --> 25:53.183
You go ahead and go
home. I don't need you.

25:53.185 --> 25:55.319
Yeah, but Douglas does.

25:55.321 --> 25:59.156
So come on.
Get in the truck, Gladys.

25:59.158 --> 26:03.160
We got Christmas to save.

26:18.711 --> 26:21.979
¶ Silent night ¶

26:21.981 --> 26:23.714
¶ Holy night ¶

26:29.621 --> 26:33.090
¶ All is calm ¶

26:33.092 --> 26:36.293
¶ All is bright ¶

26:39.264 --> 26:43.267
¶ Round yon virgin ¶

26:43.269 --> 26:47.338
¶ Mother and child ¶

26:50.041 --> 26:53.744
¶ Holy infant ¶

26:53.746 --> 26:57.715
¶ So tender and mild ¶

27:01.186 --> 27:05.389
¶ Sleep in heavenly peace ¶

27:07.826 --> 27:11.028
- It don't add up, boy.
- You got a guy tootin' around

27:11.030 --> 27:13.197
the whole Goddamn planet
in one night.

27:13.199 --> 27:16.800
That sleigh'd have to be going
25, 30,000 miles per hour,

27:16.802 --> 27:19.069
minimum. Now, if we had
that type of technology, shit,

27:19.071 --> 27:23.040
we'd be blowing the tits
off the friggin' Viet Kong.

27:23.042 --> 27:24.341
It's all a sham.

27:24.343 --> 27:25.542
Sham.

27:25.544 --> 27:27.478
Sham.

27:27.480 --> 27:30.447
What the heck's
up with that son of a B?

27:30.449 --> 27:31.915
You know what he is, right?

27:31.917 --> 27:33.717
Sham.
Damn right.

27:33.719 --> 27:35.853
What kind of creep goes
sneaking into a kid's room

27:35.855 --> 27:38.055
and putting chump
change under a pillow?

27:38.057 --> 27:40.491
What the hell's he need
all those teeth for? Pervert.

27:40.493 --> 27:44.294
The whole world
is full of lies, Boyd.

27:44.296 --> 27:45.729
The only road to happiness

27:45.731 --> 27:48.966
is realizing there's no road
to happiness.

27:48.968 --> 27:51.368
Alright, I'm going to bed.
You finish it up on your own.

27:53.572 --> 27:55.906
Oh yeah, eat me!

28:01.813 --> 28:04.682
First off...

28:05.818 --> 28:09.219
And second,
I have asthma, Dad, asthma.

28:09.221 --> 28:12.623
And it is not
all in my head,

28:12.625 --> 28:14.792
as you have so astutely
hypothesized in the past.

28:14.794 --> 28:17.094
It is an actual
medical condition

28:17.096 --> 28:18.696
that could actually kill me.

28:18.698 --> 28:23.300
So please,
put out the damn cigar.

28:23.302 --> 28:26.170
What the hell's that all
about? You on the friggin' rag?

28:26.172 --> 28:27.738
Come on.

28:40.885 --> 28:42.586
Come on, lighten up, Boyd.

28:42.588 --> 28:45.055
We got all night ahead of us.

28:45.057 --> 28:48.926
Let's have a little fun here.

28:56.434 --> 28:58.001
I bet they're having a ball.

28:58.003 --> 28:59.570
Yeah, yippee!

28:59.572 --> 29:02.306
It does make me feel better
that Mitch went with him.

29:02.308 --> 29:05.109
Them two hate each
other's guts, I thought.

29:05.111 --> 29:08.178
Okay, cut it out,
you guys, we're a family.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.514
And it's Christmas, jeez.

29:10.516 --> 29:13.250
You know, Mom, I, uh,
don't want to make you feel bad

29:13.252 --> 29:16.019
with what I'm about to say,
being that it's Christmas

29:16.021 --> 29:19.223
and all but, a lot
of this is your fault.

29:19.225 --> 29:20.924
Dave and I's marriage counsellor

29:20.926 --> 29:22.960
says that a lot of
my self-esteem problems

29:22.962 --> 29:25.129
come from the fact that
you never confronted Dad

29:25.131 --> 29:27.698
about his drinking.

29:27.700 --> 29:30.467
So it's why I seek approval

29:30.469 --> 29:33.203
from people who treat me
like wet dog crap.

29:33.205 --> 29:34.805
Who needs anything?

29:34.807 --> 29:38.809
We've got leftovers,
we've got hot dish. Beer?

29:38.811 --> 29:39.977
Reeb me!

29:39.979 --> 29:42.513
That's beer spelled
backwards, honey.

29:50.188 --> 29:51.722
Vera.

29:53.191 --> 29:54.925
Yeah, Bug?

29:54.927 --> 29:56.460
Was Rance about to say

29:56.462 --> 29:58.422
that there's
no such thing as Santa?

29:59.764 --> 30:02.733
Rance is a certified
moron, Douglas.

30:02.735 --> 30:04.535
So whatever he was about to say

30:04.537 --> 30:07.204
would have been
certified moronic.

30:07.206 --> 30:09.273
Of course there's a Santa.

30:09.275 --> 30:10.607
Promise?

30:10.609 --> 30:12.309
I promise.

30:12.311 --> 30:15.112
When you see your presents
under the tree in the morning,

30:15.114 --> 30:18.081
you'll believe again, you will.

30:18.083 --> 30:21.385
Now lie down.

30:24.289 --> 30:26.490
Okay.

30:43.875 --> 30:46.910
Wow, 53 degrees.
So much for a white Christmas.

30:46.912 --> 30:48.579
Who needs one?
Yesterday I was golfing.

30:48.581 --> 30:50.581
You would have caught
me in my shirtsleeves.

30:50.583 --> 30:52.983
Kicked Bill Gorsky's
ass, the fat pollack.

30:52.985 --> 30:55.953
I said "if this is global
warming, I'll take it."

30:55.955 --> 30:57.454
Pollack. Nice, Dad.

30:57.456 --> 30:58.689
Technically he's a bohunk.

30:58.691 --> 31:00.624
I got more if you need 'em.

31:03.394 --> 31:04.962
Hi, uh, where's the...

31:04.964 --> 31:06.797
Just past the cheese.

31:17.076 --> 31:19.409
I can guess your nationality
without even seeing you.

31:19.411 --> 31:21.511
European.

31:22.313 --> 31:23.580
You get it?

31:23.582 --> 31:25.148
You're a-peein'.

31:25.150 --> 31:26.884
Ha, yeah, got it.

31:26.886 --> 31:28.852
Ho ho ho.

31:29.821 --> 31:32.155
Hey, you got any bourbon?
Just a...

31:33.424 --> 31:34.892
I wish I did, sorry.

31:34.894 --> 31:37.094
That's okay, that's okay.

31:39.264 --> 31:44.468
So, you having yourself
a merry little Christmas?

31:46.271 --> 31:47.838
I wouldn't say that exactly.

31:47.840 --> 31:50.307
Well, nobody said it
was easy now, did they?

31:50.309 --> 31:52.009
I mean, take my journey
here tonight.

31:52.011 --> 31:53.577
I mean, logic-wise,

31:53.579 --> 31:55.145
that whole deal doesn't really
add up, does it?

31:55.147 --> 31:56.914
I mean my sleigh'd have to be
doing what,

31:56.916 --> 32:01.184
25, 30,000 miles an hour?
Minimum?

32:05.757 --> 32:08.525
But I always make it.
Somehow I always do, you know.

32:08.527 --> 32:10.093
I mean, it's not always
easy, like I say,

32:10.095 --> 32:12.195
but miracles never are.
They're tricky little things,

32:12.197 --> 32:14.264
miracles. Sometimes they look
at you right in the face.

32:14.266 --> 32:15.999
They're right in front of you,

32:16.001 --> 32:17.668
staring at you in the mirror,
and you didn't even see them.

32:17.670 --> 32:19.803
It's crazy.

32:19.805 --> 32:22.572
Um...

32:22.574 --> 32:24.508
Have a merry
Christmas, Santa.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.410
I always do, buddy.

32:26.412 --> 32:28.612
I always do.

32:31.416 --> 32:32.983
Have fun in there.

32:32.985 --> 32:34.484
I'll name it after you.

32:34.486 --> 32:36.019
Hi, can I get
a couple of coffees?

32:36.021 --> 32:39.056
That's your old man?
Virgil Mitch. Ole Mitch, huh?

32:39.058 --> 32:40.424
Yeah, I'm Boyd.

32:40.426 --> 32:41.625
You're Boyd!

32:41.627 --> 32:43.527
Yeah, you're the smart one.

32:43.529 --> 32:46.897
You got a full ride
at the UW.

32:46.899 --> 32:49.399
And now
you're a stockbroker, is it?

32:49.401 --> 32:51.068
Down in Chi-town?

32:51.070 --> 32:52.336
I manage a hedge fund.

32:52.338 --> 32:54.071
Oh yeah, that's right.

32:54.073 --> 32:56.907
But your dad tells me
you make a truckload of money.

32:56.909 --> 32:59.209
I don't know about that.
I work too much.

32:59.211 --> 33:03.547
Well, anyhow, nice
to have a face with the name.

33:03.549 --> 33:06.483
Your pop, that crazy old
son of a,

33:06.485 --> 33:09.119
he's in here pretty near
once a week,

33:09.121 --> 33:12.122
and I get an earful
about your family.

33:12.124 --> 33:13.256
Uh-oh.

33:13.258 --> 33:14.858
No! Mitch talks a blue streak

33:14.860 --> 33:17.594
about how good you're doing.

33:17.596 --> 33:22.866
Must be nice for y'all to have
Christmas together, ain't it?

33:22.868 --> 33:24.868
Uh, it is.

33:26.571 --> 33:27.671
What do I owe you?

33:27.673 --> 33:29.406
No, come on.

33:29.408 --> 33:32.009
Merry Christmas now, Boyd.

33:32.011 --> 33:34.011
Merry Christmas.

33:53.164 --> 33:55.932
You know how to
drive a manual, tranny?

33:55.934 --> 33:58.035
You don't remember

33:58.037 --> 34:01.138
the day you taught me
how to drive a stick?

34:01.140 --> 34:02.806
Should I?

34:02.808 --> 34:06.043
October 26, 1983, you may
recall, was my 12th birthday.

34:06.045 --> 34:08.844
You may also recall
that you were too hammered

34:08.847 --> 34:11.715
to drive home from my party,

34:11.717 --> 34:13.884
so I drove home.

34:14.685 --> 34:16.085
Is that right?

34:16.088 --> 34:17.888
Well, I must have been
doing something right,

34:17.889 --> 34:19.755
'cause you still remember how.

34:19.757 --> 34:21.391
Yes, it is one of
life's greatest indignities

34:21.393 --> 34:25.328
that you never won
the Father of the Year award.

34:27.632 --> 34:28.732
Hey, careful!

34:28.734 --> 34:30.500
Can't you take a joke, Sally?

34:30.502 --> 34:33.235
- Now you're pissing me off.
- Let's just get this done.

34:33.237 --> 34:34.905
Maybe you need to
piss on the radiator.

34:34.907 --> 34:37.107
Whoa, what was that?

34:40.777 --> 34:42.145
Tit.

34:44.949 --> 34:46.248
Want me to go peek in on BJ?

34:46.251 --> 34:47.516
No, I'll do it, Shauna.

34:47.518 --> 34:49.351
Wait a second, where's Nelson?

34:49.353 --> 34:51.021
Last time I saw him
he was going ape-crap

34:51.023 --> 34:52.621
because Mitch
and Boyd were scrapping.

34:52.623 --> 34:54.157
Well, that was two hours ago.

34:54.159 --> 34:56.092
Oh shoot, Nelson!

34:57.094 --> 34:58.195
Nelson!

35:00.099 --> 35:01.798
Nelson.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.101
Nelson, baby, come on.

35:05.236 --> 35:07.170
Nelson.

35:09.507 --> 35:11.842
Nelson.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.612
Where are you?

35:16.848 --> 35:19.349
Oh, he's not where
he usually goes.

35:19.351 --> 35:22.752
Whenever he gets panicked
he just falls asleep

35:22.754 --> 35:24.888
in the craziest places.

35:24.890 --> 35:28.024
I found him all balled up in
the middle of the road a coup...

35:28.026 --> 35:31.061
Oh my God.

35:32.096 --> 35:33.964
Nelson!

35:33.966 --> 35:35.932
Where are you, baby?
Wake up!

35:35.934 --> 35:36.766
Nelson!

35:36.768 --> 35:38.235
Nelson!

35:38.237 --> 35:40.370
Nelson! Where are you,
Nelson? Wake up!

35:40.372 --> 35:42.038
Donna, be careful!

35:42.040 --> 35:43.273
Nelson!

35:43.275 --> 35:45.976
Nelson!

35:45.978 --> 35:48.445
Oh... oh, dear Lord Jesus.

35:48.447 --> 35:50.647
¶ Jingle all the way ¶

35:50.649 --> 35:53.450
No, you can't sing low.
I know, high.

35:53.452 --> 35:54.951
¶ Wayyyy ¶

35:54.953 --> 35:57.020
Oh no, stop, stop, stop!

35:58.656 --> 36:00.824
¶ Oh what fun it is to ride ¶

36:00.826 --> 36:02.826
Dude, you just hit something.

36:02.828 --> 36:05.395
¶ ...open sleigh ¶

36:09.467 --> 36:12.002
Good night.

36:12.004 --> 36:14.204
Put your hands down
and let's do this.

36:16.307 --> 36:17.874
Ahem, I love you ve...
I love you very much.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.242
Let's go, come on.
See?

36:19.244 --> 36:21.311
Mom, has Santa come yet?

36:21.313 --> 36:23.914
No honey, not yet,
it's still early.

36:23.916 --> 36:26.049
Santa's got a long
night ahead of him.

36:27.251 --> 36:28.518
Can Dad tuck me in?

36:28.520 --> 36:30.120
Who? Dad?

36:30.122 --> 36:33.757
No, because, uh,
Dad and Puba...

36:36.260 --> 36:38.261
are getting massages.

36:40.164 --> 36:41.731
Oh, okay.

36:41.733 --> 36:42.966
Good night, Mom.

36:42.968 --> 36:44.501
Okay, good night.

36:55.046 --> 36:56.846
So who else isn't tired?

37:00.618 --> 37:02.519
Oh, I forgot to ask you.

37:02.521 --> 37:04.754
Did Santa Claus
accost you in the bathroom?

37:04.756 --> 37:06.189
Excuse me?

37:06.191 --> 37:07.457
You know, the grubby
old guy in the Santa suit

37:07.459 --> 37:09.292
in the truck stop bathroom.

37:09.294 --> 37:12.195
I didn't see anybody
in the bathroom.

37:17.034 --> 37:18.535
Santa's coming home soon.

37:18.537 --> 37:21.771
Gonna bring
you lots of gifts.

37:30.047 --> 37:32.182
Oh, son of a bitch!

37:32.184 --> 37:33.316
Oh!

37:33.318 --> 37:35.018
I forgot to tell you,
the speedometer's off

37:35.020 --> 37:36.319
by about 10 miles an hour.

37:36.321 --> 37:38.521
Oh it's good to know that.

37:46.631 --> 37:49.366
Well I'll be!

37:49.368 --> 37:51.635
Merry Christmas, Mr. Mitchler!

37:51.637 --> 37:53.169
Again.

37:53.171 --> 37:55.438
What brings you gents
out so late?

37:55.440 --> 37:57.807
Well, numbnuts here forgot
his kid's presents in Chi-town.

37:57.809 --> 38:00.010
Numbnuts, that's funny.

38:00.012 --> 38:04.481
Haven't heard that one
in quite some time!

38:04.483 --> 38:06.249
My foster mom, she, uh...

38:06.251 --> 38:09.219
Oh, I see you guys are in the
portable john business, huh?

38:09.221 --> 38:11.154
Indeed we are, sir.
Mitch Mitchler,

38:11.156 --> 38:12.822
North Central Wisconsin
king of the crappers.

38:12.824 --> 38:14.491
For 25 years,

38:14.493 --> 38:16.092
Mitchler's Handi-crappers have
been supplying luxury johns

38:16.094 --> 38:17.761
for all your business needs.

38:17.763 --> 38:20.430
I always say,
if you gotta go, go in style!

38:20.432 --> 38:21.698
I like that a lot.

38:21.700 --> 38:24.734
Do you guys do family reunions?

38:24.736 --> 38:26.403
My cousin actu...

38:26.405 --> 38:29.572
We're actually in a really
big hurry, Trooper Zblocki, so.

38:29.574 --> 38:30.940
I could tell, Mr. Mitchler.

38:30.942 --> 38:33.422
Caught old numbnuts
here doing 91.

38:34.313 --> 38:37.580
I'll be back
with your citation, STAT.

38:37.582 --> 38:40.116
Numbnuts.

38:41.787 --> 38:43.987
Funny little elf.

38:48.893 --> 38:52.962
Well, Mr. Mitchler, I did
clock you doing 91, yikes!

38:52.964 --> 38:55.565
It's like, "Arriba,
arriba, andele, andele!"

38:56.968 --> 38:58.468
Bart Simpson.

39:01.106 --> 39:04.274
But, it's Christmas,
so you know what?

39:04.276 --> 39:06.943
I got candy canes
for you three guys.

39:06.945 --> 39:08.611
Three?

39:15.820 --> 39:17.487
Nelson?

39:17.489 --> 39:19.889
Jeez, I must've
fell asleep in here.

39:22.793 --> 39:24.994
Who's that guy?

39:27.264 --> 39:30.567
A child is the most important
thing a mother has, Nelson.

39:30.569 --> 39:34.304
Jeez, I'm sorry
I had you worried, Mom.

39:34.306 --> 39:36.573
If anything
had happened to you...

39:36.575 --> 39:38.108
Aw, jeez.

39:38.110 --> 39:40.243
Mom, could you put
little BJ on the phone?

39:40.245 --> 39:41.511
I want to tell him I'm okay.

39:41.513 --> 39:43.913
He's sleeping
in his crib, hon.

39:43.915 --> 39:46.583
Plus he's not even a year.

39:46.585 --> 39:49.853
Well, maybe just go in
there and tell him I love him?

39:49.855 --> 39:54.524
And, uh, could you sing him that
pretty little song he likes?

39:55.760 --> 39:59.195
¶ Hot tortillas,
crisp tostadas ¶

39:59.197 --> 40:02.332
¶ Best in Me-hi-co ¶

40:02.334 --> 40:06.636
¶ Enchiladas, empanadas ¶

40:06.638 --> 40:11.074
¶ How I love them so ¶

40:13.611 --> 40:16.546
It is a miracle
that you got pulled over,

40:16.548 --> 40:19.349
because I could have froze
to death in there, or worse.

40:19.351 --> 40:21.217
Not cold enough
to freeze to death.

40:21.219 --> 40:23.186
Okay, real quick,
what could possibly be worse

40:23.188 --> 40:25.355
than freezing to death
in a portable toilet, Nelson?

40:25.357 --> 40:29.692
HIV, AIDS, Lou Gehrig
disease, cancer, spina bifida...

40:29.694 --> 40:32.061
Okay, all good ones.

40:32.063 --> 40:34.097
I could think of one worse.

40:34.099 --> 40:35.632
A guy getting his gonads
lobbed off by his wife

40:35.634 --> 40:38.835
because he forgot his
kid's Christmas presents.

40:50.681 --> 40:52.315
Get 'im!

40:52.317 --> 40:53.683
I'm not supposed to
play video games,

40:53.685 --> 40:55.585
but you're really
awesome at them, Rance.

40:55.587 --> 40:56.953
Yeah, I know.

40:56.955 --> 40:59.055
We should totally put your
picture on Craigslist, Vera.

40:59.057 --> 41:01.958
Your judgement
is really questionable, Pam.

41:10.534 --> 41:12.101
You gonna stay up
with us, Dave?

41:12.103 --> 41:14.270
Oh no, I, uh...
I get hungry at night

41:14.272 --> 41:16.206
so I like to make myself a meal
so I have something to eat

41:16.208 --> 41:18.408
between sleep and breakfast.

41:18.410 --> 41:19.742
I call it breep.

41:19.744 --> 41:21.311
Okay.

41:21.313 --> 41:22.812
It's an anagram I came
up with, much like brunch

41:22.814 --> 41:26.683
or NASA. It's a way for me
to remember what I like.

41:29.153 --> 41:31.688
Hon, let's go hit the sack.

41:31.690 --> 41:34.357
Good night.
Night.

41:34.359 --> 41:35.492
Night.

41:35.494 --> 41:37.360
Oh, Daver.

41:37.362 --> 41:39.662
Oooh!

41:39.664 --> 41:41.764
You are too good for me.

41:52.843 --> 41:54.177
You know, maybe I will try

41:54.179 --> 41:55.778
one of those
beer-tomato-juice thingies.

41:55.780 --> 41:59.482
Well now you're talking.
One red beer coming right up.

42:04.054 --> 42:06.523
Holy cripes, it's a castle.

42:08.225 --> 42:10.393
You really
are doing alright, Boyd.

42:18.369 --> 42:19.969
You've never seen
this house before?

42:19.971 --> 42:22.238
No, your mom has.
Last time I was here,

42:22.240 --> 42:24.741
you had that apartment
by the lake.

42:24.743 --> 42:27.143
It's going on seven years.

42:28.612 --> 42:30.079
What's this you got
on the walls here?

42:30.081 --> 42:31.548
Is that brick?

42:31.550 --> 42:33.750
Yeah, it's...
uh, it's a brick house.

42:37.187 --> 42:39.389
Boy, that is something.

42:39.391 --> 42:40.590
Yeah.

42:52.102 --> 42:54.971
Son of a bitch!

42:54.973 --> 42:57.040
I left my damn keys
in my damn car!

43:04.949 --> 43:07.450
Hey Hamburglar,
will this help?

43:15.460 --> 43:18.428
The presents
are in the mudroom, so...

43:18.430 --> 43:20.330
Hey Boyd, I gotta
take a squirt.

43:20.332 --> 43:23.099
You guys have a bathroom, or...

43:23.101 --> 43:25.134
Yeah, it's upstairs.

43:25.136 --> 43:26.869
Make yourself at home, Dad.

43:26.871 --> 43:28.871
Yeah.

43:59.403 --> 44:01.871
Dad?

44:01.873 --> 44:03.873
Nelson?

44:26.430 --> 44:28.665
What's going on?

44:28.667 --> 44:30.800
What are you doing in my house?

44:32.302 --> 44:33.736
I am Farhad.

44:33.738 --> 44:37.240
Who are these people?

44:37.242 --> 44:40.476
Ms. Mitchler is say,

44:40.478 --> 44:44.781
my family to sit in the house,

44:45.783 --> 44:48.251
to feed dog...

44:48.253 --> 44:50.553
there, the dog.

44:51.355 --> 44:53.890
To sit in the house.

44:53.892 --> 44:58.461
House-sitting is different
than sitting in my house!

44:59.596 --> 45:02.932
Ah, it's Boyd.

45:02.934 --> 45:04.901
Hi, is everything okay?

45:04.903 --> 45:07.236
<i>- Fine, okay.
- Farhad is here.</i>

45:07.238 --> 45:09.906
Yeah, I gave him the key
so he could feed Dale.

45:09.908 --> 45:10.973
You knew that.

45:10.975 --> 45:12.709
No, but his whole family
is here.

45:12.711 --> 45:15.912
It's like Goldilocks
and the 30 Iranians.

45:15.914 --> 45:18.648
Boyd, they're from Afghanistan.

45:18.650 --> 45:19.916
I don't care
where they're from,

45:19.918 --> 45:22.051
I care why they're here,
in my house!

45:22.053 --> 45:23.319
Ooo, maybe there was confusion

45:23.321 --> 45:24.821
over the translation
of house-sit.

45:24.823 --> 45:26.889
<i>You know,
they're an amazing family.</i>

45:26.891 --> 45:29.292
They've only been
in the country two months,

45:29.294 --> 45:32.061
so, whatever, let them
have a nice Christmas.

45:32.063 --> 45:33.696
<i>You're not saving the world!</i>

45:33.698 --> 45:36.199
What do you think, you're, uh...
you think you're Bono?

45:36.201 --> 45:37.734
I have a law degree!
I'm a teacher!

45:37.736 --> 45:40.036
You're supposed to be
teaching refugees English,

45:40.038 --> 45:41.637
and based upon
my conversation with this guy,

45:41.639 --> 45:43.706
it's not exactly
working out, is it?!

45:43.708 --> 45:45.675
If anyone's
to blame, it's you!

45:45.677 --> 45:47.977
You for being an ass sponge!

45:47.979 --> 45:49.312
I'm the ass sponge?

45:49.314 --> 45:51.581
Yes, you are
the ass sponge, ass sponge.

45:51.583 --> 45:52.782
I'm not having
this conversation.

45:52.784 --> 45:54.317
I am not having
this conversation.

45:54.319 --> 45:55.585
Fine.

45:55.587 --> 45:58.988
Oh my God!
He acts like the sweetest,

45:58.990 --> 46:02.391
nothing-bothers-me guy, but
the slightest little pressure

46:02.393 --> 46:04.694
turns him into a total...

46:04.696 --> 46:05.976
Ass sponge?

46:07.298 --> 46:09.098
He sounds
just like his father.

46:09.100 --> 46:11.667
You know, in case those
guys don't make it back

46:11.669 --> 46:13.469
in time somehow,

46:13.471 --> 46:16.639
maybe we oughtta have
something else for Douglas.

46:16.641 --> 46:17.673
Like what?

46:17.675 --> 46:19.742
Maybe we oughtta
go up to the attic

46:19.744 --> 46:22.779
and wrap some old toys
and that, just in case.

46:22.781 --> 46:26.182
Yeah, okay fine.

46:26.184 --> 46:28.151
Donna, do you have
something else

46:28.153 --> 46:31.687
that maybe
doesn't taste like... this?

46:31.689 --> 46:33.156
Vodka?

46:33.158 --> 46:35.892
Hey Doug-lass, you wanna
do something really cool?

46:35.894 --> 46:37.693
Yes!

46:37.695 --> 46:39.128
Sweet.

46:39.130 --> 46:41.130
You know, I wasn't
a competitive eater

46:41.132 --> 46:42.498
'til I was like, nine.

46:42.500 --> 46:44.000
If I would have started
at seven,

46:44.002 --> 46:46.803
who knows how much more
friggin' awesome I'd be?

46:46.805 --> 46:49.572
Ah, let's see how fast you
can take these bad boys down.

46:49.574 --> 46:51.307
A whole jar of pickles?

46:51.309 --> 46:53.509
Do it.

46:56.046 --> 46:57.580
Please don't,
Douglas, it's stupid.

46:57.582 --> 46:59.048
You'll be sick for Santa!

46:59.050 --> 47:00.983
You want to be cool
or retarded?

47:00.985 --> 47:03.152
Man or mouse, Douglas?

47:06.557 --> 47:08.024
Yes! Oh my God! Look at him go!

47:12.596 --> 47:15.231
Chug, chug, chug,
chug, chug, chug, chug!

47:15.233 --> 47:16.799
Douglas, stop!

47:16.801 --> 47:19.302
These pickles were canned
during the Nixon Administration!

47:19.304 --> 47:22.138
You're gonna die!

47:22.140 --> 47:24.340
I can't feel my legs.

47:37.988 --> 47:40.022
What the hell?

47:54.938 --> 47:56.906
He erased me.

47:58.442 --> 48:00.643
Ain't that a kick
in the pants?

48:04.214 --> 48:06.015
Presents. Gifts.

48:06.017 --> 48:07.049
Ho ho ho?

48:07.051 --> 48:09.085
Gift?

48:09.087 --> 48:11.320
Gift, yes, yes.

48:11.322 --> 48:13.322
Thank you.

48:13.324 --> 48:15.224
No, Farhad.

48:15.226 --> 48:17.927
Those are Douglas' gifts!

48:17.929 --> 48:20.429
My son! Douglas.

48:20.431 --> 48:22.164
No Farhad son!

48:22.166 --> 48:24.400
No! My son's gifts!

48:25.269 --> 48:27.003
Girls, those are
my power tools!

48:27.005 --> 48:29.538
That's Boyd's power drill
and that is very...

48:29.540 --> 48:32.008
Ahhh! Jesus!

48:33.410 --> 48:34.877
Hey, Boyd.
These your roommates?

48:34.879 --> 48:37.647
Hey Boyd, you got a nail
sticking out of your hand there.

48:45.155 --> 48:47.356
Oh, we've been learning Nari,
which is kind of like Farsi,

48:47.358 --> 48:49.158
over at basic
because my reserve unit

48:49.160 --> 48:51.260
was going to be going over
by Afghanistan...

48:51.262 --> 48:52.762
Oh!

48:52.764 --> 48:53.996
And I fell off
of that Humvee,

48:53.998 --> 48:56.532
and I got just a touch
of brain damage.

48:56.534 --> 48:59.635
But the part that remembers
Nari is just fine.

48:59.637 --> 49:04.273
So, can you tell him
that his family can stay?

49:04.275 --> 49:06.542
I just need Douglas' gifts.

49:06.544 --> 49:08.744
Well, I can sure as shoot try.

49:10.247 --> 49:12.548
Let's see, uh...

49:17.722 --> 49:19.989
- Please, no, no.
- No, no, no, please!

49:21.359 --> 49:22.925
Hey, hey.

49:22.927 --> 49:26.262
Hey, hey, it's okay.
You can keep everything.

49:26.264 --> 49:28.230
The only thing I want

49:28.232 --> 49:30.032
is that.

49:52.956 --> 49:56.092
Hey, it's, uh, 3:45,
so we have less than four hours

49:56.094 --> 49:58.427
if we're gonna get back
before the kids get up.

49:58.429 --> 50:00.629
So I need you to motivate.

50:02.065 --> 50:04.266
You don't need me;
you never did.

50:16.713 --> 50:19.448
It's all gonna be okay, Bug.

50:19.450 --> 50:21.984
Boing!

50:21.986 --> 50:24.620
It's okay, Bug.

50:24.622 --> 50:26.455
Boing, hello Rance!

50:26.457 --> 50:28.858
They told me there'd
always be people like you.

50:28.860 --> 50:31.293
I don't know,
I've never seen anybody

50:31.295 --> 50:32.695
this way from pickles!

50:32.697 --> 50:35.297
Rotten food can cause
hallucination, Rance.

50:35.299 --> 50:36.966
Everybody knows that, you dummy.

50:36.968 --> 50:39.235
It's gonna be okay,
Bug, just lie down.

50:46.209 --> 50:47.810
Mmmm, cheese.

50:49.746 --> 50:51.947
How about this for Douglas?

50:55.352 --> 50:57.553
Bridge, like the card game?

50:57.555 --> 50:59.021
For kids?

50:59.023 --> 51:01.057
I don't know,
it seems like a horrible idea.

51:01.059 --> 51:04.460
Boyd loved bridge for juniors,
it was his favourite game!

51:04.462 --> 51:06.328
He did?

51:06.330 --> 51:08.631
Okay, bag it and tag it,
I guess.

51:11.034 --> 51:13.769
That was Mitch's
drink of choice.

51:13.771 --> 51:15.438
Vodka and cranberry juice.

51:15.440 --> 51:17.773
It must have been so hard.

51:17.775 --> 51:20.176
I don't know.

51:20.178 --> 51:23.512
I left a couple times
when it got too hard.

51:23.514 --> 51:25.147
Took the kids
to my folks,

51:25.149 --> 51:28.651
then when his bender
was finished,

51:28.653 --> 51:30.486
he'd call bellyaching,

51:30.488 --> 51:34.490
"Come back, come back.
I'll change, I'll change,"

51:34.492 --> 51:36.192
blah, blah, you know.

51:39.029 --> 51:41.597
He was always...

51:41.599 --> 51:44.266
a very attentive lover,
though.

51:44.268 --> 51:46.669
If you know what I mean?

51:46.671 --> 51:49.004
I do. Yes, wow.

51:50.340 --> 51:53.309
Boyd and I haven't had sex
for six months.

51:53.311 --> 51:55.744
Oh, wow.

51:55.746 --> 51:57.246
That is bad for you.

51:57.248 --> 52:00.249
It's so bad.
It's just, you know,

52:00.251 --> 52:02.751
he works all the time,
and... or we're tired,

52:02.753 --> 52:04.854
or the kids are around
and you know, it just...

52:04.856 --> 52:06.589
But then he has
this whole thing

52:06.591 --> 52:08.858
about how everything has to be
so perfect, and it can't be.

52:08.860 --> 52:10.192
It's not. It's not perfect.

52:10.194 --> 52:13.095
Do you want me
to talk to him for you?

52:13.097 --> 52:15.698
No, that's okay, thank you.

52:15.700 --> 52:17.700
That would feel
a little inappropriate.

52:19.537 --> 52:22.505
Yep.

52:22.507 --> 52:24.707
What?

52:39.689 --> 52:42.158
<i>¶ Two days later,
Papa passed away ¶</i>

52:42.160 --> 52:45.127
<i>¶ And I became a man that day ¶</i>

52:45.129 --> 52:47.463
<i>¶ So I told Mama
I'm gonna quit school ¶</i>

52:58.909 --> 53:02.344
I packed
my grandmother's trunk,

53:02.346 --> 53:04.747
and in it I put an apple.

53:04.749 --> 53:06.148
Nice.

53:06.150 --> 53:08.284
God, we used to play
that when we'd drive

53:08.286 --> 53:10.386
to Nana's cottage
up north, you remember?

53:10.388 --> 53:11.887
Mm-hm.

53:11.889 --> 53:14.857
Okay, I packed
my grandmother's trunk

53:14.859 --> 53:18.360
and in it I put
an apple and a bagpipe.

53:18.362 --> 53:20.763
Nice one.
Okay Dad, you're up.

53:22.566 --> 53:24.366
Dad, it's your turn.

53:24.368 --> 53:27.570
Come on Dad,
it's been a crap day.

53:27.572 --> 53:30.406
Everything that possibly could
go wrong already has.

53:33.643 --> 53:35.844
What, you on the rag, Sally?

53:37.414 --> 53:41.517
I packed my grandma's trunk,
and in it I put an apple,

53:41.519 --> 53:44.353
bagpipe,

53:44.355 --> 53:46.922
and a kid
who's so ashamed of his old man,

53:46.924 --> 53:49.124
he cut him
out of a family photo.

53:51.328 --> 53:52.895
Okay, so you're spelling
kid with a C then.

53:52.897 --> 53:54.530
Uh, fair enough.

53:54.532 --> 53:56.732
I don't know what to say, Dad.

53:58.468 --> 54:02.271
Fine, as long as we're being
honest with each other,

54:02.273 --> 54:06.175
yes, I was embarrassed
of you in that photograph.

54:06.177 --> 54:08.944
You were wearing that filthy
Handi-crapper T-shirt

54:08.946 --> 54:11.981
for a family portrait.
I mean come on!

54:13.116 --> 54:14.396
What, you're suddenly sensitive?

54:18.355 --> 54:20.789
Besides, it's not like
you were ever proud of me.

54:20.791 --> 54:22.258
I always supported you,

54:22.260 --> 54:24.860
whatever it was
you wanted to do, always!

54:24.862 --> 54:27.396
Are you high?

54:29.000 --> 54:30.466
What is that?

54:34.204 --> 54:35.437
Oh my gosh!

54:35.439 --> 54:37.439
Hoho!

54:43.180 --> 54:44.780
Is that...

54:44.782 --> 54:47.449
Bea Arthur? It sure is.

54:47.451 --> 54:48.784
Why?

54:48.786 --> 54:50.119
Boyd went through a phase

54:50.121 --> 54:52.721
where he really
got into Bea Arthur.

54:52.723 --> 54:54.723
Like is... like sexually? Or...

54:54.725 --> 54:57.459
No!
It started with <i> Golden Girls.</i>

54:57.461 --> 55:00.963
Wait, he liked bridge
and <i> Golden Girls?</i>

55:00.965 --> 55:02.931
What did you raise,
a 75-year-old woman?

55:02.933 --> 55:05.034
Look, there's a whole series.

55:05.036 --> 55:09.271
You know how what's-his-futz
just painted blue stuff?

55:09.273 --> 55:11.907
Well, Boyd only
painted Bea Arthur.

55:11.909 --> 55:14.143
This is so silly.

55:14.145 --> 55:16.445
My Boyd who played
football and basketball,

55:16.447 --> 55:19.148
who's a type-A
hedge fund manager?

55:19.150 --> 55:20.449
No, no!

55:20.451 --> 55:23.052
He was real arty-farty
when he was a little shaver.

55:23.054 --> 55:25.821
Well Mitch
must have loved that.

55:25.823 --> 55:27.856
Mitch, he used to
tease Boyd all the time.

55:27.858 --> 55:29.191
I felt terrible about it.

55:29.193 --> 55:31.994
He drilled legs
into the frame of this one.

55:31.996 --> 55:34.363
He turned it into a card table.

55:34.365 --> 55:37.299
He used to play euchre on it
with his drinking buddies.

55:37.301 --> 55:40.703
Look, there's the rings
from the glasses

55:40.705 --> 55:42.438
on the canvas, there.

55:42.440 --> 55:44.840
And I think Bill Gorsky
puked on it here.

55:44.842 --> 55:47.142
That is so mean.

55:47.144 --> 55:49.044
Isn't that so mean?

55:49.046 --> 55:50.713
Lookit, that is so mean!

55:50.715 --> 55:53.649
He was just a little
artist, creating his art,

55:53.651 --> 55:56.185
and that's... I mean,
it just makes me very sad,

55:56.187 --> 55:57.486
isn't that so sad?

55:57.488 --> 56:00.956
Boyd never really
painted much after that.

56:00.958 --> 56:02.524
Mitch is a bastard!

56:02.526 --> 56:04.226
And I have been trying to
get those guys to reconcile,

56:04.228 --> 56:06.628
but do you understand
how much Boyd hates his job?

56:06.630 --> 56:08.931
He hates it so much,
and all he wanted to do

56:08.933 --> 56:11.600
was be a sweet little
Bea Arthur painter!

56:11.602 --> 56:13.936
Or something.

56:13.938 --> 56:16.338
I just feel like I could puke.

56:16.340 --> 56:18.340
It blows my mind.

56:18.342 --> 56:22.077
You have the capacity to
feel sorry for yourself!

56:22.079 --> 56:23.645
Oh, what a jackass.

56:23.647 --> 56:26.181
If I loused up so bad, how
come you have such a nice life?

56:26.183 --> 56:28.717
Nice house,
nice wife, nice job.

56:28.719 --> 56:30.219
I hate my job!

56:30.221 --> 56:32.488
And I haven't had sex
with my wife in six months!

56:32.490 --> 56:34.757
And you blame that on me?
Jiminy crickets!

56:34.759 --> 56:36.392
Jeez, come on, guys!

56:36.394 --> 56:38.694
I'm sorry I didn't snuggle
or cuddle you enough!

56:38.696 --> 56:40.796
I'm sorry I'm not perfect!

56:40.798 --> 56:41.997
Perfect?

56:41.999 --> 56:44.266
My entire approach
to parenting

56:44.268 --> 56:48.804
is based on what I call
the WWMD principle.

56:48.806 --> 56:51.240
What Would Mitch Do?
I ask myself that question,

56:51.242 --> 56:54.176
and then I do
the exact opposite.

56:54.178 --> 56:56.678
Come on Boyd, you know I
get jittery 'cause of the war!

56:56.680 --> 56:58.147
You didn't go to war!

56:58.149 --> 57:00.048
He's still a hero!
He's still a hero!

57:03.987 --> 57:05.587
Son of a bitch!

57:05.589 --> 57:08.190
No, no, no, no, no!

57:10.460 --> 57:11.794
No, Boyd, slow down!

57:11.796 --> 57:13.262
We can do it.

57:13.264 --> 57:15.545
Not sure if you can see
me back here, Mr. Mitchler...

57:17.268 --> 57:18.934
See that?
See it!

57:20.304 --> 57:21.703
Come on, Boyd,
you're gonna get us killed!

57:21.705 --> 57:23.138
Pull over, Boyd!

57:23.140 --> 57:24.907
My whole life I've never
been your kind of man,

57:24.909 --> 57:27.776
a man's man, a real man.

57:27.778 --> 57:31.380
Well, let's see who the real man
is now! Hold on!

57:42.459 --> 57:45.360
Shut up, Sally.
You sound like a little bitch.

57:56.673 --> 58:01.143
Yeah, suck on that, Zblocki!
Suck on that! Eat it, bitch!

58:02.045 --> 58:03.512
Yes, yes!

58:03.514 --> 58:04.980
<i>Yeah, go ahead.</i>

58:04.982 --> 58:07.249
Uh, yeah.

58:07.251 --> 58:09.985
Umm, I'm out at uh...

58:09.987 --> 58:12.688
Mr. Mitchler, he...

58:12.690 --> 58:15.057
<i>, everything okay?</i>

58:16.559 --> 58:18.494
Eff this.

58:18.496 --> 58:20.863
Just wanted to wish you
a merry Christmas, Don!

58:20.865 --> 58:23.932
I'm calling her a night.
Gonna head home to the fam.

58:23.934 --> 58:26.134
<i>Roger that.</i>

58:32.141 --> 58:34.343
Oh God, that felt good!

58:35.778 --> 58:37.546
You're not this guy, Boyd.

58:37.548 --> 58:40.082
You're not some idiot who'd
run away from a cop like that.

58:40.084 --> 58:43.018
Hell, that's the kind of
asshole stunt that I'd pull.

58:43.020 --> 58:45.220
You got
the asshole part right.

58:48.791 --> 58:52.528
Maybe you're right about that.

58:59.769 --> 59:01.770
This has been a weird night.

59:03.973 --> 59:05.574
I'm sorry.

59:06.943 --> 59:10.312
I'm sorry to both of you.

59:10.314 --> 59:12.180
Mainly you, Boyd.

59:13.049 --> 59:15.250
I'm sorry.

59:16.252 --> 59:17.953
Suppose I might
have said it sooner

59:17.955 --> 59:20.255
if I hadn't been so hammered
for most of the last 30 years

59:20.257 --> 59:22.224
but you know?

59:22.226 --> 59:24.626
There it is, I said it.

59:29.133 --> 59:31.567
You're a good man

59:31.569 --> 59:35.003
and uh,

59:35.005 --> 59:37.739
I'm so sorry.

59:46.283 --> 59:48.550
I'm sorry, oh!

59:48.552 --> 59:50.819
What the hell was that?!

59:50.821 --> 59:52.621
Did we hit somebody?

59:54.024 --> 59:55.724
I'm telling you, Boyd,
that was a person!

59:55.726 --> 59:58.493
Nelson, it wasn't a person.

59:58.495 --> 01:00:00.095
It can't have been a person.

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:02.631
What would a person be doing
in the middle of the road...

01:00:02.633 --> 01:00:05.067
Maybe it was a deer.
Yeah, it was a deer!

01:00:05.069 --> 01:00:06.368
It wasn't a deer.

01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:08.570
Yes, of course it was a d...

01:00:10.506 --> 01:00:12.774
Oh no.

01:00:29.092 --> 01:00:31.426
Oh God, oh my God, oh my God!

01:00:31.428 --> 01:00:33.996
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

01:00:33.998 --> 01:00:35.664
Okay, Boyd, just calm down.

01:00:35.666 --> 01:00:39.801
Calm?! Calm?
I just killed a man!

01:00:39.803 --> 01:00:41.737
This is not the time to be calm!

01:00:41.739 --> 01:00:43.605
We just gotta...
we just gotta call the cops.

01:00:43.607 --> 01:00:45.540
No, we're not gonna call the
cops! I just outran the cops!

01:00:45.542 --> 01:00:47.542
The last thing
we need are the cops!

01:00:47.544 --> 01:00:49.811
Boyd's right, no cops.
My life is over!

01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:51.279
No it isn't!

01:00:51.281 --> 01:00:53.315
I'm gonna go to prison.
I'm going to prison.

01:00:53.317 --> 01:00:56.084
Boyd, just glass-half-full
it for a sec here, okay?

01:00:56.086 --> 01:00:58.320
Prison these days
is not half bad.

01:00:58.322 --> 01:00:59.988
I'll take the heat!

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:01.857
I mean, come on now,
it's the least I can do,

01:01:01.859 --> 01:01:03.825
you know, being shitfaced
and emotionally abusive

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:05.127
most of your childhood.

01:01:05.129 --> 01:01:06.395
No, Dad, no.

01:01:06.397 --> 01:01:09.097
No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:01:09.099 --> 01:01:11.900
Boyd, Boyd, Boyd!

01:01:11.902 --> 01:01:13.869
There's other ways out of this.

01:01:13.871 --> 01:01:15.103
How?

01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:17.072
This guy, uh...

01:01:17.074 --> 01:01:18.607
We're not exactly
talking doctor,

01:01:18.609 --> 01:01:20.489
lawyer,
Indian chief here, right?

01:01:21.911 --> 01:01:23.845
He's off the grid.

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:26.348
So if he umm, disappeared.

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:29.518
I got this friend, Mike Marcort.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:32.087
You know, we play cribbage,
and he owes me

01:01:32.089 --> 01:01:34.990
and uh, he's got a warehouse
down by Campbell Sport

01:01:34.992 --> 01:01:37.159
full of HCl.

01:01:37.161 --> 01:01:38.560
HC what, Dad?

01:01:38.562 --> 01:01:41.263
Hydrochloric acid.
And so?

01:01:41.265 --> 01:01:42.764
Well, you know, I'm saying...

01:01:42.766 --> 01:01:44.499
not that he doesn't have
value in God's eyes;

01:01:44.501 --> 01:01:46.768
I'm just saying that we soak
this guy in a vat of HCl

01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:47.936
for a couple of hours?

01:01:47.938 --> 01:01:50.305
This son of a bitch
will just fizzle away.

01:01:50.307 --> 01:01:51.673
Wait a minute.

01:01:51.675 --> 01:01:53.809
We're not really
thinking about this?

01:01:54.877 --> 01:01:56.344
He's right, Dad.

01:01:56.346 --> 01:01:58.547
Nelson's right.

01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:04.553
We don't have time
to go to Campbell Sport.

01:02:04.555 --> 01:02:06.755
You're right, it's too far.
What was I thinking?

01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:10.425
Dad, do you have a shovel?

01:02:10.427 --> 01:02:12.627
Does Flipper pee in the sea?
I got that!

01:02:12.629 --> 01:02:14.162
No, no, guys...

01:02:14.164 --> 01:02:15.764
Well, do you have
a better idea?

01:02:15.766 --> 01:02:17.466
Do you? Because
I'd love to hear it.

01:02:17.468 --> 01:02:19.334
No, but have you ever
dug a foxhole before, Boyd?

01:02:19.336 --> 01:02:22.204
Because I have and it
takes a super long time!

01:02:22.206 --> 01:02:23.238
Oh, he's right!

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.440
Nelson's right.

01:02:28.177 --> 01:02:31.146
We could... we can burn him.

01:02:31.148 --> 01:02:33.482
You know, like a fire.

01:02:33.484 --> 01:02:36.551
Burning could work,
burning's good!

01:02:36.553 --> 01:02:38.220
That's good, Nel...

01:02:38.222 --> 01:02:40.255
What's going on, Dad?

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:41.590
If we're gonna burn him,
it's a hell of a lot easier

01:02:41.592 --> 01:02:43.792
if you parcel him out.

01:02:59.475 --> 01:03:01.676
You got any bourbon?

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:08.350
Hey, Doug!

01:03:08.352 --> 01:03:10.085
Dougie doodle.

01:03:10.087 --> 01:03:11.253
Who said that?

01:03:14.857 --> 01:03:15.857
Bingo.

01:03:15.859 --> 01:03:17.025
You can talk?

01:03:17.027 --> 01:03:18.794
You're seeing
my lips move, ain't ya?

01:03:18.796 --> 01:03:21.363
Well then, that would constitute
talking, wouldn't it?

01:03:21.365 --> 01:03:22.864
Is this a dream?

01:03:22.866 --> 01:03:26.301
"Is this a dream?" Maybe,
maybe it's a dream,

01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:28.036
or maybe I'm your subconscious,

01:03:28.038 --> 01:03:30.305
secretly trying to
unearth truth for you

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:32.641
in the form
of a waking hallucination.

01:03:32.643 --> 01:03:34.643
Listen Doug, let me
get to the gristle

01:03:34.645 --> 01:03:36.878
of why I woke you up
here. It breaks my heart

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:40.949
to tell you this, but
Santa ain't gonna find you,

01:03:40.951 --> 01:03:43.752
not here, not anywhere.

01:03:43.754 --> 01:03:44.653
Why not?

01:03:44.655 --> 01:03:47.856
Because he doesn't exist.

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:52.127
Yeah, don't take
it so hard, buddy.

01:03:52.129 --> 01:03:55.096
As you get older, you'll learn
there are much worse things

01:03:55.098 --> 01:03:56.598
you could be told

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:59.668
than some fat guy
in a red suit doesn't exist.

01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:02.504
Alright then,
sleep tight, kid.

01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:05.974
And oh uh, Merry Christmas.

01:04:10.213 --> 01:04:12.414
Radiator's shot.

01:04:16.185 --> 01:04:17.385
Who ya calling there, Boyd?

01:04:17.387 --> 01:04:18.687
Luann.

01:04:18.689 --> 01:04:20.522
Let her know
we're not gonna make it.

01:04:20.524 --> 01:04:22.190
Not gonna make it?

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:24.092
Hold on a sec, Boyd.

01:04:24.094 --> 01:04:27.696
Hey look, I know that
we have been through a lot,

01:04:27.698 --> 01:04:30.599
well, me getting stuck
in the john

01:04:30.601 --> 01:04:32.968
and you getting pegged with
a nail gun by some kid,

01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:34.269
and running from that cop,

01:04:34.271 --> 01:04:35.470
and trying to figure out
different ways

01:04:35.472 --> 01:04:38.073
to dismember a transient,

01:04:38.075 --> 01:04:41.910
but it's Christmas,
and if we quit now,

01:04:41.912 --> 01:04:44.846
it's like the baby Jesus died
up on that cross for nothing.

01:04:44.848 --> 01:04:46.982
I think
that's Easter, actually.

01:04:46.984 --> 01:04:49.684
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you're right, you're right.

01:04:49.686 --> 01:04:52.787
My point is, you know,
I suppose I don't know much

01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:55.924
about being a father yet,
since BJ's only been around

01:04:55.926 --> 01:04:58.026
a couple of months
and he's technically

01:04:58.028 --> 01:05:01.396
some Mexican's, on top
of that but, you know,

01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:05.000
what I seen you do today, Boyd...
go to the ends of the earth

01:05:05.002 --> 01:05:06.601
for your son like that...

01:05:06.603 --> 01:05:09.871
jeez, that's what being
a father's all about.

01:05:09.873 --> 01:05:13.074
And I just don't think
you should quit now.

01:05:14.277 --> 01:05:15.844
There's still time.

01:05:30.459 --> 01:05:34.696
Hey, uh, I'm really sorry we
almost killed you back there.

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:39.734
I don't suppose you have
a vehicle we could borrow?

01:05:39.736 --> 01:05:41.636
'Cause we're about
10 miles from where

01:05:41.638 --> 01:05:44.539
we're supposed to
be here, and um...

01:05:46.142 --> 01:05:49.077
I don't know how else
to put this, except...

01:05:49.079 --> 01:05:52.013
we're hoping for
a friggin' Christmas miracle.

01:06:00.323 --> 01:06:03.425
¶ Fall on your knees ¶

01:06:03.427 --> 01:06:06.494
¶ Oh, hear the radiant
voices calling ¶

01:06:06.496 --> 01:06:09.531
¶ Oh God, oh God ¶
¶ Boom, boom, boom ¶

01:06:13.336 --> 01:06:15.670
Oh, shoot!
Luann, are you okay?

01:06:15.672 --> 01:06:17.872
I'm okay, I'm okay.

01:06:25.915 --> 01:06:27.916
Yeah!

01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:30.986
Come on you guys, wake up!

01:06:30.988 --> 01:06:32.988
Let's go up
and see if Santa came.

01:06:54.443 --> 01:06:56.945
They're breathing. Come on!

01:07:11.394 --> 01:07:13.194
Come on, whoa, whoa!

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:18.600
See, I told you Santa's real!
Now we can find our stuff.

01:07:23.005 --> 01:07:24.706
Pull up there, there!

01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:26.908
What do you
think you got, Bug?

01:07:28.611 --> 01:07:30.812
I don't think I got anything.

01:07:36.652 --> 01:07:38.153
We can't thank you enough.

01:07:38.155 --> 01:07:40.388
Merry Christmas,
it's been a flight!

01:07:50.766 --> 01:07:52.834
Where you goin', they're up?

01:07:52.836 --> 01:07:54.836
Yeah. He's up. All the kids
have their presents.

01:07:54.838 --> 01:07:56.237
So what, go on in there
and give him the thing!

01:07:56.239 --> 01:07:58.640
He'll know
there's no Santa, Dad!

01:08:09.452 --> 01:08:13.154
Maybe Santa took your presents
to the wrong house, or...

01:08:13.156 --> 01:08:14.622
No.

01:08:14.624 --> 01:08:16.124
There is no Santa.

01:08:16.126 --> 01:08:19.160
Look.
Puba said he loved bourbon.

01:08:36.278 --> 01:08:38.279
Merry Christmas.

01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:03.203
Good luck.

01:09:04.439 --> 01:09:05.439
Oh!

01:09:05.442 --> 01:09:06.741
No Douglas, don't!

01:09:19.955 --> 01:09:22.689
You must be Douglas.

01:09:22.692 --> 01:09:24.292
Are you Santa?

01:09:24.294 --> 01:09:26.794
Oh, yes indeed. Yes, I am.

01:09:26.796 --> 01:09:28.997
Why'd you drink
all that bourbon, Santa?

01:09:28.999 --> 01:09:30.398
Won't it make you drunk?

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:34.402
Well, Douglas,
bourbon gives Santa the energy

01:09:34.404 --> 01:09:38.139
that he needs to keep
his appointed rounds.

01:09:39.308 --> 01:09:41.609
And asparagus.
Puba told me that.

01:09:41.611 --> 01:09:44.779
Yep, asparagus, too.

01:09:44.781 --> 01:09:46.814
Smart fella.

01:09:46.816 --> 01:09:48.883
Oh my goodness,

01:09:48.885 --> 01:09:50.818
I almost forgot your present.

01:09:52.587 --> 01:09:54.522
Merry Christmas, Douglas.

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:57.058
Thank you, Santa.

01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:58.393
I believe.

01:09:59.828 --> 01:10:02.163
And I hope you always do.

01:10:03.399 --> 01:10:07.001
Santa, don't you
want your asparagus?

01:10:07.003 --> 01:10:09.604
That's okay,
Douglas, you keep it.

01:10:09.606 --> 01:10:11.806
Asparagus makes
my urine smell funny.

01:10:12.841 --> 01:10:15.043
Merry Christmas.

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:23.451
I think it was a big success.

01:10:26.388 --> 01:10:27.655
On second thought

01:10:27.657 --> 01:10:29.857
this may have not been
such a hot idea.

01:10:33.028 --> 01:10:36.598
No matter how this pans
out, you tried your best.

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:39.767
Bottom line, you're one
hell of a good dad, Boyd.

01:10:41.604 --> 01:10:43.805
Thanks, Dad.

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:54.415
Merry Christmas, Bug.

01:10:55.818 --> 01:10:58.019
Dad, why did your
massage take so long?

01:10:59.888 --> 01:11:01.422
Let me help you.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.561
- Nice wrap job there.
- What is it?

01:11:06.563 --> 01:11:07.996
What do you say?

01:11:07.998 --> 01:11:09.364
I built it, the whole thing.

01:11:09.366 --> 01:11:11.199
I even sanded
the runners myself.

01:11:11.201 --> 01:11:13.668
It's really something.

01:11:13.670 --> 01:11:15.870
Really something.

01:11:17.239 --> 01:11:19.774
Wow, it's pretty cool, huh?

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:21.976
Hmm, neat, but no snow.

01:11:21.978 --> 01:11:23.645
Let's see what else there is.

01:11:23.647 --> 01:11:25.413
Uh, hey Bug!

01:11:25.415 --> 01:11:27.815
Uh, look,
I found this outside for you.

01:11:27.817 --> 01:11:29.784
Santa must have dropped it.

01:11:39.595 --> 01:11:41.129
Bridge for juniors!

01:11:41.131 --> 01:11:44.299
I've always wanted to
learn how to play bridge!

01:11:44.301 --> 01:11:46.200
Woo-hoo, alright!

01:11:46.202 --> 01:11:47.935
Neato, look at what I got!

01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:53.708
I'm sorry.

01:11:53.710 --> 01:11:55.810
I'm drunk.

01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:58.713
I remain sorry.

01:11:58.715 --> 01:12:00.915
And I accept your apology.

01:12:05.087 --> 01:12:06.621
Oh for cripe's sake,
Boyd, get a Goddamn room

01:12:06.623 --> 01:12:08.156
if you're gonna be doing that.

01:12:08.158 --> 01:12:09.791
Dave's the designated
pervert in this family.

01:12:09.793 --> 01:12:11.993
He's not a pervert!

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:32.380
Hey, hey!

01:12:32.382 --> 01:12:34.382
Rancer!

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:39.754
You think I would
have known better.

01:12:39.756 --> 01:12:41.456
Oh, I suppose.

01:12:41.458 --> 01:12:43.324
But if we always learned
from our mistakes,

01:12:43.326 --> 01:12:45.526
nobody'd ever spend
Christmas with their family.

01:12:47.463 --> 01:12:49.364
What the hell good is getting
a sled in this day and age

01:12:49.366 --> 01:12:52.066
of global warming? You should
have got the kid a boat.

01:12:52.068 --> 01:12:55.269
Shut up, Dad.

01:12:55.271 --> 01:12:57.538
Dad, can we go inside
and play some bridge now?

01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:25.099
Look Dad, it's snowing!

01:13:25.101 --> 01:13:27.635
You're right, Bug.

01:13:27.637 --> 01:13:29.637
Probably ash.

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:51.325
¶ More, more, more, more ¶

01:13:51.327 --> 01:13:54.328
¶ Can't you hear it? ¶

01:13:54.330 --> 01:13:56.731
¶ More, more, more, more ¶

01:13:56.733 --> 01:13:59.767
¶ Love comes through ¶

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:01.702
¶ Give me happiness ¶

01:14:01.704 --> 01:14:04.338
¶ You're like the sun ¶

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:09.343
¶ You're my holiday,
my favourite one ¶

01:14:12.314 --> 01:14:15.383
¶ More than I wished for ¶

01:14:15.385 --> 01:14:17.985
¶ Bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum ¶

01:14:17.987 --> 01:14:20.421
¶ Bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum ¶

01:14:20.423 --> 01:14:23.090
¶ Bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum ¶

01:14:23.092 --> 01:14:26.027
¶ More than I wished for ¶

01:14:26.029 --> 01:14:28.463
¶ Bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum ¶

01:14:28.465 --> 01:14:31.232
¶ Bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum ¶

01:14:31.234 --> 01:14:33.901
¶ Bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum ¶

01:14:33.903 --> 01:14:37.338
¶ Bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum ¶

01:14:39.409 --> 01:14:42.143
¶ Ring, ring ¶

01:14:42.145 --> 01:14:44.712
¶ I hear the birds ¶

01:14:44.714 --> 01:14:47.114
¶ Sing, sing ¶

01:14:47.116 --> 01:14:49.717
¶ Sweet Noel ¶

01:14:49.719 --> 01:14:54.722
¶ Peace for everyone,
be all good cheer ¶

01:14:54.724 --> 01:14:59.327
¶ A merry, wonderful
time of year ¶

01:15:03.765 --> 01:15:06.033
¶ More than I wished for ¶

01:15:06.035 --> 01:15:08.803
¶ Bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum ¶

01:15:08.805 --> 01:15:11.272
¶ Bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum ¶

01:15:11.274 --> 01:15:14.008
¶ Bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum ¶

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:16.811
¶ More than I wished for ¶

01:15:16.813 --> 01:15:19.280
¶ Bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum ¶

01:15:19.282 --> 01:15:22.016
¶ Bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum ¶

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:24.485
¶ Bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum ¶

01:15:24.487 --> 01:15:27.522
¶ Bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum ¶

01:15:30.927 --> 01:15:33.828
¶ You're my angel and the sun ¶

01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:35.763
¶ You are my mistletoe ¶

01:15:35.765 --> 01:15:39.066
¶ You're my star
that's shining bright ¶

01:15:39.068 --> 01:15:41.269
¶ You are my Silent Night ¶

01:15:41.271 --> 01:15:43.971
¶ You're the sweetest
little thing ¶

01:15:43.973 --> 01:15:46.474
¶ You are out of a dream ¶

01:15:46.476 --> 01:15:49.110
¶ You're my sugar and my spice ¶

01:15:49.112 --> 01:15:51.979
¶ You're the naughty
to my nice ¶

01:15:51.981 --> 01:15:54.882
¶ You are the one ¶

01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:56.984
¶ You're more than I wish for ¶

01:15:56.986 --> 01:15:59.353
¶ Bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum ¶

01:15:59.355 --> 01:16:01.989
¶ Bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum ¶

01:16:01.991 --> 01:16:04.725
¶ Bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum ¶

01:16:04.727 --> 01:16:07.328
¶ More than I wished for ¶

01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:10.031
¶ Bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum ¶

01:16:10.033 --> 01:16:12.533
¶ Bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum ¶

01:16:12.535 --> 01:16:15.169
¶ Bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum ¶

01:16:15.171 --> 01:16:18.472
¶ More than I wished for ¶

01:16:18.474 --> 01:16:21.676
¶ Bu-doo-bum, boom boom ¶

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:32.820
¶ Joy to the world,
the Lord has come ¶

01:16:32.822 --> 01:16:37.258
¶ And he's drivin' a
big green bass boat ¶

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:41.395
¶ Circling around
your castle's moat ¶

01:16:41.397 --> 01:16:45.600
¶ He's the new favourite
late night talk-show host ¶

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:52.773
¶ That's why we try ¶

01:16:52.775 --> 01:16:54.775
¶ To love ¶

01:16:57.879 --> 01:17:02.249
¶ Now that you're here,
come gather round ¶

01:17:02.251 --> 01:17:06.454
¶ Check out these treasures
that I found ¶

01:17:06.456 --> 01:17:10.358
¶ One makes a flash,
the other makes a sound ¶

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:14.829
¶ But none will catch you
from crashing down ¶

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.769
¶ That's why we try ¶

01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:24.772
¶ To love ¶

01:17:55.337 --> 01:17:59.573
¶ Life just kicks you, 1-2-3 ¶

01:17:59.575 --> 01:18:03.644
¶ Keeps us guessing him or me ¶

01:18:03.646 --> 01:18:07.181
¶ There's always more to see,
always more want ¶

01:18:11.421 --> 01:18:16.123
¶ That's why we try ¶

01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:18.125
¶ To love ¶

01:18:18.127 --> 01:18:22.229
¶ That's why we try ¶

01:18:22.231 --> 01:18:26.434
¶ To love ¶

01:18:54.629 --> 01:18:57.264
¶ The weather outside
is frightful ¶

01:18:57.266 --> 01:19:01.769
¶ And the fire is so inviting ¶

01:19:05.842 --> 01:19:08.609
¶ The sound of sleigh bells
ringing ¶

01:19:08.611 --> 01:19:11.812
¶ Is all the more delightful ¶

01:19:17.887 --> 01:19:22.623
¶ The sight of snow falling
lightly on her cheek ¶

01:19:29.265 --> 01:19:34.668
¶ The things around this little
town aren't so bleak ¶

01:19:40.743 --> 01:19:44.378
¶ And the lights are up
on the door ¶

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:50.050
¶ They say it's Christmas time ¶

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:55.723
¶ And I felt this once before ¶

01:19:57.626 --> 01:20:01.862
¶ And I can't get it
out of my mind ¶

01:20:09.906 --> 01:20:15.309
¶ We can go out walking till
the snow starts to gleam ¶

01:20:18.747 --> 01:20:21.649
¶ Do you remember the stories
I told you? ¶

01:20:21.651 --> 01:20:25.853
¶ Or was it all a dream? ¶

01:20:29.791 --> 01:20:34.762
¶ I still can't believe that you
are with me once again ¶

01:20:35.897 --> 01:20:39.900
¶ My dear ¶

01:20:50.412 --> 01:20:53.714
¶ Deck the halls
with boughs of holly ¶

01:20:53.716 --> 01:20:57.284
¶ Fa la la, la la la, la la la ¶

01:20:57.286 --> 01:21:00.221
¶ Tis the season to be jolly ¶

01:21:00.223 --> 01:21:03.123
¶ Fa la la, la la la, la la la ¶

01:21:03.125 --> 01:21:05.793
¶ Don we now our gay apparel ¶

01:21:05.795 --> 01:21:08.395
¶ Fa la la, la la la, la la la ¶

01:21:08.397 --> 01:21:11.632
¶ Troll the ancient
Yule tide carol ¶

01:21:11.634 --> 01:21:14.535
¶ Fa la la la la ¶

01:21:14.537 --> 01:21:17.504
¶ La la la... ¶

01:21:17.506 --> 01:21:20.374
¶ La... ¶
¶ La! ¶

01:21:21.843 --> 01:21:25.479
¶ Ah... ¶

01:21:25.481 --> 01:21:27.948
¶ ...la! ¶

01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:29.583
That's what you gotta commit
to a song.
Okay.

01:21:29.585 --> 01:21:31.785
That's why we don't get
first place.
