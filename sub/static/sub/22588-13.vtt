My super instant mesmerizer.
It never fails.

00:51.717 --> 00:54.451
Okay, boys, carry him out.

01:10.369 --> 01:12.335
Hey, just a minute.

01:12.337 --> 01:13.803
That's my cap.

01:16.275 --> 01:19.376
Take him along, too, boys.

01:28.754 --> 01:30.320
Look, look, look, you.

01:30.322 --> 01:33.890
What are you doing
with my hat?

01:39.398 --> 01:41.865
Add him to the list.

01:45.337 --> 01:46.937
Right.

01:47.372 --> 01:48.672
Three more hats

01:48.674 --> 01:51.575
stolen right out
from under our noses.

01:51.577 --> 01:52.576
Not to mention their owners.

01:52.578 --> 01:55.212
I would say a pattern is
beginning to take shape.

01:55.214 --> 01:58.315
- A pattern, sir?
- A villainous pattern, indeed.

01:58.317 --> 02:00.283
At this rate, no hat
in Gotham City

02:00.285 --> 02:01.885
will be safe
from Jervis Tetch.

02:01.887 --> 02:03.587
You mean the
accursed Mad Hatter

02:03.589 --> 02:05.622
is back to his
fiendish practices?

02:05.624 --> 02:06.323
Who else?

02:06.325 --> 02:10.493
It was a sad day, indeed, when
the word "parole" was coined.

02:10.495 --> 02:11.995
If memory serves
me, commissioner

02:11.997 --> 02:16.233
the Mad Hatter not only is a
mortal enemy of Gotham City

02:16.235 --> 02:16.900
but also--

02:16.902 --> 02:18.635
Precisely, Chief O'Hara.

02:18.637 --> 02:20.237
The Cowled Crusader, himself

02:20.239 --> 02:23.473
was a witness at
the Mad Hatter's last trial.

02:23.475 --> 02:25.642
We have no other choice.

02:25.644 --> 02:28.311
We need his help and now.

02:28.313 --> 02:31.548
Let's hope to heaven
we can reach him.

02:33.018 --> 02:34.584
<i> But can they reach him?</i>

02:34.886 --> 02:37.086
<i> Or are millionaire,</i>
<i> Bruce Wayne</i>

02:37.088 --> 02:39.155
<i> and his youthful ward,</i>
<i> Dick Grayson</i>

02:39.157 --> 02:41.658
<i> up to something else</i>
<i> this morning</i>

02:41.660 --> 02:44.193
<i> in stately Wayne Manor?</i>

02:45.096 --> 02:47.297
I'll summon him, sir.

02:50.068 --> 02:52.969
You sent to Italy
for that piece of rock?

02:52.971 --> 02:53.736
Piece of rock?

02:53.738 --> 02:54.971
Why, this is
carrara marble, Dick.

02:54.973 --> 02:58.675
Famous from antiquity
and still being quarried.

02:58.677 --> 03:00.577
Gee, carrara marble.

03:00.579 --> 03:03.279
Uh, it's just possible
this bust was sculptured

03:03.281 --> 03:05.815
by the famous
Carnato himself.

03:05.817 --> 03:06.749
Gosh, Carnato?

03:06.751 --> 03:09.152
One of the great masters.
When we have more time,

03:09.154 --> 03:11.154
I'll acquaint you with the
processes of sculpturing.

03:11.156 --> 03:15.124
It's fascinating, after which
I devoted many hours of study.

03:15.126 --> 03:16.826
I'd like to hear
about it, Bruce.

03:16.828 --> 03:18.795
Forgive me for
interrupting, sir.

03:18.797 --> 03:21.064
But it's the Bat-phone.

03:21.066 --> 03:22.265
Hot diggity.

03:22.267 --> 03:24.801
I'm in a quandary, Bruce.

03:24.803 --> 03:26.703
The Gotham City gourmet society

03:26.705 --> 03:28.371
tea tasting is this afternoon.

03:28.373 --> 03:31.074
And I don't know whether
to start with

03:31.076 --> 03:32.108
oolong or pekoe.

03:32.110 --> 03:34.077
Well, whatever decision
you make, Aunt Harriet

03:34.079 --> 03:36.145
I'm sure it'll be
the right one.

03:36.147 --> 03:37.947
Uh, they just called to report

03:37.949 --> 03:40.216
they sighted
a black-footed albatross

03:40.218 --> 03:41.250
at Sleighter's Slew.

03:41.252 --> 03:43.720
And maybe a fork-tailed petrel.

03:43.722 --> 03:48.257
A fork-tailed petrel
and a black-footed albatross

03:48.259 --> 03:50.760
on the day of
the tea tasting?

03:50.762 --> 03:55.164
You know how they are about
their bird sighting, madam.

03:57.002 --> 03:59.402
- Yes, commissioner?
- Jervis Tetch.

03:59.404 --> 04:01.237
The Mad Hatter is
at large again.

04:01.239 --> 04:04.974
- Him again?
- We'll be right over.

Nobody's safe when that human
scourge prowls our streets.

06:08.167 --> 06:10.500
It's possible he's
planning to unleash a new

in our fair city.

with that super instant
mesmerizer in his high hat.

06:16.442 --> 06:19.309
That devil of a trademark.
Where will he stop?

06:19.311 --> 06:21.311
In the court of law,
Chief O'Hara.

06:21.313 --> 06:23.413
Where he's been
stopped before.

06:23.415 --> 06:24.081
Exactly.

06:24.083 --> 06:26.716
When you testified against
him in his last trial

06:26.718 --> 06:29.920
he said he'd get you, if it was
the last thing he ever did.

06:29.922 --> 06:32.156
Few men die
of threats, Robin.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.827
Commissioner Gordon.

06:36.829 --> 06:38.162
Yes.

06:38.164 --> 06:39.663
Right away.

06:39.665 --> 06:40.497
He struck again.

06:40.499 --> 06:42.299
He just stole
the fire chief's hat

06:42.301 --> 06:44.835
and the fire chief from
the convention hall.

06:44.837 --> 06:47.204
- Holy helmets.
- Will you need reinforcements?

06:47.206 --> 06:50.007
Thanks, chief. I think
it's best for you and your men

06:50.009 --> 06:53.544
to stand by closely until
we catch this tricky devil.

06:53.546 --> 06:54.878
You have our gratitude.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.213
Thank you,
Commissioner Gordon.

06:56.215 --> 06:58.348
Fighting crime
deserves no gratitude.

06:58.350 --> 07:00.984
It's my fervent that
warped minds such as his

07:00.986 --> 07:04.121
can be rehabilitated
once and for all.

07:06.425 --> 07:08.926
Clear all exits
for the Batmobile.

07:08.928 --> 07:13.864
I repeat, clear all exits
for the Batmobile.

07:27.079 --> 07:30.580
<i> But, at the same time,</i>
<i> in this old building</i>

07:30.582 --> 07:33.717
<i> which doubles as a warehouse</i>
<i> and the secret hideout</i>

07:33.719 --> 07:37.821
<i> for the Mad Hatter</i>
<i> and his slippery stooges..</i>

07:52.004 --> 07:54.037
There.
Two more to go.

07:54.039 --> 07:56.606
And the dummies of the conniving
jury that convicted me

07:56.608 --> 07:58.141
will, at last, be
properly topped.

07:58.143 --> 08:00.210
- How whimsical, Jervis.
- Thank you, Lisa.

08:00.212 --> 08:03.213
It's a pleasure to share my
moments of triumph with you.

08:03.215 --> 08:05.182
I'm supposed to be
on my coffee break.

08:05.184 --> 08:08.285
At least, that's what
I told Madam Magda.

08:08.287 --> 08:09.186
Madam Magda.

08:09.188 --> 08:12.255
Little does she know
she's to be my next victim.

08:12.257 --> 08:13.590
Oh, how merry, Jervis.

08:13.592 --> 08:15.325
Before we get to
the next victim

08:15.327 --> 08:16.460
when do we get
the next meal?

08:16.462 --> 08:20.530
Gettin' bonnets for the dummies
ain't filling our stomachs.

08:20.532 --> 08:21.431
Or our wallets.

08:21.433 --> 08:23.433
Our wallets will
be filled, boys.

08:23.435 --> 08:26.436
As soon as I've completed
the most fantastic

08:26.438 --> 08:30.107
hat snatch of
my glorious career.

08:30.109 --> 08:32.109
Batman's cowl?

08:32.111 --> 08:32.809
Precisely.

08:32.812 --> 08:35.813
Jervis, that's
positively waggish.

08:35.815 --> 08:36.446
Waggish, maybe.

08:36.448 --> 08:39.482
But taking on Batman's
a big order, boss.

08:39.485 --> 08:40.284
The biggest.

08:40.285 --> 08:43.554
Not only will I add his
cowl to my unique collection

08:43.556 --> 08:46.523
but I will have exposed
our monstrous enemy

08:46.525 --> 08:50.194
once and for all before
he meets his gory end.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.295
You rogue.

08:51.297 --> 08:53.397
Many others have tried
killing Batman.

08:53.399 --> 08:56.300
Many others do not have
the lethal equipment

08:56.302 --> 08:59.603
of my hat factory, Dicer.

09:00.606 --> 09:03.273
Start the motors.

09:04.376 --> 09:06.376
Excellent for sheering
rabbit fur.

09:06.378 --> 09:09.079
Think what it would do
to a man's skin.

09:09.081 --> 09:11.582
Jervis, I don't dare.

09:14.453 --> 09:17.221
These stretchers form felt

09:17.223 --> 09:20.157
into the shape
of hat crowns.

09:20.159 --> 09:24.294
What form would they shape
a man's muscles and marrow?

09:24.296 --> 09:27.164
Mush. Oatmeal mush.

09:27.633 --> 09:30.467
Crown croppers.

09:30.469 --> 09:32.169
And this, a felt shredder.

09:32.171 --> 09:35.372
Or should I say a shredder
of a chubby felt?

09:40.112 --> 09:44.014
And this for shrinking
and sizing hat bodies.

09:44.016 --> 09:48.518
But why not shrink and size
the body of Batman himself?

09:48.520 --> 09:50.654
Oh, my heart
leaps with joy

09:50.656 --> 09:52.422
when I think that one day

09:52.424 --> 09:54.124
my dastardly adversary

09:54.126 --> 09:57.594
may end up as
a hat rim or crown.

09:57.596 --> 09:59.029
Or even..

09:59.031 --> 10:01.064
...a tassel on a Tam O' Shanter.

10:01.066 --> 10:04.902
A Tam O' Shanter.
Oh, you pixie.

10:04.904 --> 10:06.236
Oh.

10:07.306 --> 10:10.908
I swore vengeance when he
testified against me.

10:10.910 --> 10:12.175
And I'll get it.

10:12.177 --> 10:12.943
I'll get it.

10:12.945 --> 10:15.012
Of course, you will, darling.

10:15.014 --> 10:16.546
When do we get our break?

10:16.548 --> 10:18.015
I heard that, Cappy.

10:18.017 --> 10:20.217
Why do you think
I snatched the owner

10:20.219 --> 10:22.552
of each hat the way I did?

10:22.554 --> 10:25.622
The jury is still out.

10:25.624 --> 10:27.925
<i> Regalez vous.</i>

10:31.030 --> 10:34.598
What an antique idea.

10:35.968 --> 10:39.503
We'll reach a verdict, soon.

10:40.572 --> 10:43.507
Two more jurors and I'll
ask the biggest ransom

10:43.509 --> 10:45.008
Gotham City has
ever heard of.

10:45.010 --> 10:47.110
All of this country's
presidents hats

10:47.112 --> 10:50.480
currently on loan
at the Gustonian Institution.

10:50.482 --> 10:51.248
Presidents hats?

10:51.250 --> 10:53.283
Yes, Washington's,
Jefferson's

10:53.285 --> 10:55.419
Lincoln's, Grant's,
worth millions.

10:55.421 --> 10:56.720
You're a genius, Jervis.

10:56.722 --> 11:00.357
And all topped
by Batman's cowl.

11:00.359 --> 11:01.191
Oh, don't worry boys.

11:01.193 --> 11:03.060
It'll be top hat
and tails from now on.

11:03.062 --> 11:05.562
It may be tougher than
you think, trapping the Batman

11:05.564 --> 11:08.598
in his hideout without
getting the cops involved.

11:09.268 --> 11:10.701
I've thought of that
too carefully.

11:10.703 --> 11:12.736
That's why I picked
another spot.

11:12.738 --> 11:15.105
That's where you..

11:15.107 --> 11:18.141
...and Madam Magda
come in, Lisa.

11:18.143 --> 11:19.576
And here's where I leave.

11:19.578 --> 11:21.578
I can't be late
for work, Jervis.

11:21.580 --> 11:24.014
I don't want
to jeopardize my job

11:24.016 --> 11:24.715
at the millinery shop.

11:24.717 --> 11:28.452
Don't worry my dear,
it'll all be so simple.

11:29.855 --> 11:32.456
So very simple.

11:38.598 --> 11:41.665
<i> But what of Batman and Robin?</i>

11:41.667 --> 11:43.501
<i> Little realizing the enormity</i>

11:43.503 --> 11:46.437
<i> of the Mad Hatter's</i>
<i> abominable schemes</i>

11:46.439 --> 11:49.740
<i> our dauntless duo</i>
<i> cross questions</i>

11:49.742 --> 11:51.876
<i> a frightened</i>
<i> hat check girl.</i>

11:51.878 --> 11:54.979
Now, perhaps if you
started again, Miss..

11:54.981 --> 11:58.149
Babette.
People call me Babette.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.583
That's my name.

11:59.585 --> 12:01.051
The robbery,
the kidnapping?

12:01.053 --> 12:02.920
It all happened so quickly.

12:02.922 --> 12:03.788
I was counting my tips.

12:03.790 --> 12:05.990
And then, the fire
chief's hat was gone?

12:05.992 --> 12:08.692
So was the fire chief,
going anyway.

12:08.694 --> 12:13.197
While that funny man flashed
that funny thing in his face.

12:13.199 --> 12:15.032
The super instant mesmerizer.

12:15.034 --> 12:19.570
Well, it super instant-ed
the fire chief, alright.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.505
Then they carried him out.

12:21.507 --> 12:22.106
They?

12:22.108 --> 12:26.444
There were three of them
all together.

12:26.446 --> 12:26.977
Three?

12:26.979 --> 12:30.981
Was one wearing a top hat
and the others, homburgs?

12:30.983 --> 12:33.050
You must be clairvoyant
or something.

12:33.052 --> 12:34.952
And I suppose it only
took a second?

12:34.954 --> 12:37.021
How did you know?
How could you have guessed?

12:37.023 --> 12:40.591
We're familiar with the method
of operation of this criminal.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.894
I'm sorry I wasn't here to
prevent his dastardly attack.

12:43.896 --> 12:46.530
Well, you're here
now, Batman.

12:46.532 --> 12:49.166
Batman, your Bat-phone
is buzzing.

12:49.168 --> 12:50.067
Thank you, Miss Babette.

12:50.069 --> 12:51.836
You've been of
great assistance.

12:51.838 --> 12:55.172
I wish there was
more I could do.

13:03.683 --> 13:04.515
Yes, Commissioner.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.851
The Mad Hatter has
been spotted again.

13:06.853 --> 13:09.153
Outside Magda's
Millinery Mason.

13:09.155 --> 13:12.690
- 61, Gotham Lane.
- Roger.

13:12.692 --> 13:15.893
Hat shop, 61 Gotham Lane.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.199
<i> Mason Magda.</i>

13:21.201 --> 13:24.702
<i> Hat box for high society.</i>

13:32.512 --> 13:33.511
Oh, no, no, no.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.780
I don't like it at all.

13:35.782 --> 13:40.218
Actually, I like the one
you're wearing very much better.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.020
Oh..

13:42.022 --> 13:45.423
It is from my personal
wardrobe, Mrs. Monteagle.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.091
And not for sale.

13:47.093 --> 13:49.660
Perhaps Lisa can find
something similar.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.764
Maybe something with
a little veiling, you know.

13:52.766 --> 13:56.200
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

13:56.536 --> 14:01.172
Mrs. Monteagle, veiling is
for much older women than you.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.440
You think so?

14:03.777 --> 14:05.810
Oh, I like that.

14:05.812 --> 14:08.713
Oh, yes, that's the one.

14:08.715 --> 14:11.649
Oh, it's beautiful

14:15.088 --> 14:16.454
Help!

14:16.456 --> 14:18.356
Help!

14:18.891 --> 14:21.692
<i> Could it be, they're</i>
<i> too late again?</i>

14:21.694 --> 14:26.997
<i> The Mad Hatter has heisted</i>
<i> his eleventh head piece?</i>

14:26.999 --> 14:29.066
<i> And his eleventh juror?</i>

14:29.068 --> 14:34.839
<i> And made his escape under the</i>
<i> very noses of the Dynamic Duo?</i>

14:55.127 --> 14:57.228
Oh, Batman,
am I glad to see you.

14:57.230 --> 15:00.798
- I'm Hermione Monteagle.
- How do you do?

15:00.800 --> 15:04.201
There's been a kidnapping
and a hat-napping

15:04.203 --> 15:07.238
both right in this
place, right now.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.639
Alarming, indeed.

15:08.641 --> 15:09.773
And poor Madam Magda.

15:09.775 --> 15:12.710
They stole her,
right under my very eyes.

15:12.712 --> 15:15.980
Oh, I don't know what
the world's coming to.

15:15.982 --> 15:19.550
My, I simply love
that cowl.

15:19.552 --> 15:23.020
I'm sure the communists had
something to do with this.

15:23.022 --> 15:26.757
I suspect the culprit can be
found closer to home.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.926
Hermione.

15:28.928 --> 15:29.627
Excuse me.

15:29.629 --> 15:32.596
The kidnapper dropped
this as he was leaving.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.732
Perhaps it may be
of some help.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.033
Clues are always helpful.

15:36.035 --> 15:38.602
Octave Marbot, sculptor.

15:38.604 --> 15:39.136
This is odd.

15:39.138 --> 15:41.238
It requires further
thought and study.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.807
We must reappraise
this situation.

15:43.809 --> 15:44.842
Gosh, Batman, sure.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.810
I'll report this
to the authorities.

15:46.812 --> 15:48.879
I trust that
Madam Magda's abductors

15:48.881 --> 15:52.149
will be apprehended before
further harm befalls her.

15:52.151 --> 15:53.584
Or her hat.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.286
Oh, I loved her hat.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.222
And that divine cowl.

15:58.224 --> 16:01.792
I wonder if it comes
in any other color.

16:21.213 --> 16:23.047
I know Octave Marbot.

16:23.049 --> 16:25.749
I'm sitting for a statue
he's making of me.

16:25.751 --> 16:27.217
Statue?
Holy happenstance.

16:27.219 --> 16:29.787
Yes, Warden Crichton
requested it

16:29.789 --> 16:31.322
to exhibit at a
Gotham State Prison

16:31.324 --> 16:35.759
to help inspire the convicts
in his rehabilitation program.

16:35.761 --> 16:38.362
Gosh, Batman,
that's a great idea.

16:38.364 --> 16:42.967
But why would the Mad Hatter
drop this card

16:42.969 --> 16:45.169
in Madam Magda's shop?

16:45.171 --> 16:47.071
He could be taunting us
with a clue.

16:47.073 --> 16:50.374
Perhaps the edge lighted,
loose sight map of Gotham City

16:50.376 --> 16:53.711
will tell us some more.

16:54.146 --> 16:57.247
Now, he's been striking
all over the city.

16:57.249 --> 17:00.751
Madam Magda's
millinery mason.

17:00.753 --> 17:04.188
The silver shop
which is here.

17:05.324 --> 17:08.258
Convention hall.

17:08.260 --> 17:10.761
Gotham sporting goods,
over here.

17:10.762 --> 17:14.732
The hotel, where he
stole the chef's hat.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.233
And the chef.

17:16.236 --> 17:17.902
Exactly, Robin.

17:17.904 --> 17:21.305
There is a pattern.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.876
And Marbot's studio

17:25.877 --> 17:27.344
is the topper.

17:27.546 --> 17:31.047
Robin, I suggest we pay
a call on <i> Monsieur</i> Marbot.

17:31.049 --> 17:33.250
A bird in the hand
is worth two in the bush.

17:33.252 --> 17:36.954
I couldn't have stated it
better myself, old chum.

17:42.963 --> 17:47.198
<i> Can it be possible Batman</i>
<i> has fallen for this ruse?</i>

17:47.200 --> 17:50.569
<i> And what about</i>
<i> Octave Marbot himself?</i>

17:50.571 --> 17:52.604
<i> Is he an innocent sculptor?</i>

17:52.606 --> 17:55.941
<i> Or a part of this evil scheme?</i>

18:17.798 --> 18:20.265
Better activate the anti-theft
device, Robin.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.400
'Gosh, yes, Batman.'

18:22.402 --> 18:27.572
Commissioner Gordon says there's
been a rash of car thefts.

18:52.599 --> 18:57.402
Oh,<i> mon'amie,</i> Batman
and the Boy Wonder.

18:57.404 --> 19:00.605
To what do I owe
the honor of this visit?

19:00.607 --> 19:02.841
You have come back
for your next sitting?

19:02.843 --> 19:05.844
There's no time for posing
today, Monsieur Marbot.

19:05.846 --> 19:08.246
We're here on a matter
of grave urgency.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.582
<i> Oui,</i> but of course.

19:10.584 --> 19:12.951
What can I do to help you?

19:12.953 --> 19:15.186
Do you know a man
named Jervis Tetch?

19:15.188 --> 19:17.388
Better known
as the Mad Hatter.

19:17.390 --> 19:20.058
Jervis Tetch?

19:20.060 --> 19:22.894
Jervis Tetch.

19:22.896 --> 19:23.862
No.

19:23.864 --> 19:27.265
He's presently victimizing
Gotham City.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.433
The Mad Hatter?

19:28.435 --> 19:33.338
And somehow he dropped this card
when he made his last catch.

19:36.309 --> 19:39.878
I do not know where
he could have gotten it.

19:39.880 --> 19:42.347
I don't know the Mad Hatter.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.650
I am Octave Marbot.

19:44.652 --> 19:46.852
A simple sculptor.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.821
Alright,<i> Monsieur</i> Marbot.

19:49.823 --> 19:51.256
We didn't mean
to alarm you.

19:51.258 --> 19:53.058
Well, as long
as you're here

19:53.060 --> 19:57.329
perhaps I could
persuade you to pose.

19:58.332 --> 20:01.866
I'm having trouble
with the <i> tete.</i>

20:01.868 --> 20:03.335
The head.

20:03.337 --> 20:05.704
Perhaps if I could
persuade you

20:05.706 --> 20:07.372
to remove your cowl

20:07.374 --> 20:09.975
I could see what's wrong.

20:09.977 --> 20:11.676
Remove my cowl?

20:11.678 --> 20:14.813
In my dressing room, of course.

20:14.815 --> 20:18.116
Boy Wonder could
hand it out to me.

20:18.885 --> 20:22.053
Alright,<i> Monsieur</i> Marbot.

20:22.456 --> 20:24.256
Come on, Robin.

20:39.373 --> 20:41.740
It's working better
than I dreamed.

20:41.742 --> 20:44.409
Batman's in the dressing room
with Boy Wonder.

20:44.411 --> 20:47.345
My expert mimicry
of perfect French

20:47.347 --> 20:50.649
fooled them completely.

20:54.988 --> 20:56.054
The moment..

20:56.056 --> 20:57.288
The moment has
finally arrived.

20:57.290 --> 21:00.759
- Batman's cowl at last.
- I don't like it, boss.

21:00.761 --> 21:03.662
Cowl or no cowl.
Batman is still Batman.

21:03.664 --> 21:04.195
Never fear.

21:04.197 --> 21:06.698
He wouldn't dare
follow us and be exposed

21:06.700 --> 21:07.666
for all the world to see.

21:07.668 --> 21:12.203
We'll take his cowl and be on
our way. Conceal yourselves.

21:14.307 --> 21:15.073
I smell a rat.

21:15.075 --> 21:17.008
You smell the Mad Hatter
in Marbot's disguise.

21:17.010 --> 21:20.445
He gave himself away with that
remark about my statue's head.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.347
That was the first
part he finished.

21:22.349 --> 21:23.915
And he was very
pleased with it.

21:23.917 --> 21:27.052
You're not going to hand
him your cowl, are you?

21:27.054 --> 21:27.919
Of course not, Robin.

21:27.921 --> 21:30.422
I wanna find
the real Octave Marbot.

21:30.424 --> 21:33.058
Holy switcheroo.
I should've known.

21:33.827 --> 21:37.829
- Someone's moaning
- No doubt, our man.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.834
It is Octave Marbot.

21:42.836 --> 21:43.768
Untie him, Robin.

21:43.770 --> 21:47.939
I'm going to put an end
to our crafty adversary

21:47.941 --> 21:49.908
once and for all.

21:49.910 --> 21:53.178
I wonder what could be
keeping Boy Wonder.

21:53.180 --> 21:56.948
Jervis Tetch, your days
of crime are over.

21:56.950 --> 22:00.251
Not till I get
your cowl, Batman.

22:00.253 --> 22:01.119
My thirteenth hat.

22:01.121 --> 22:04.122
Cappy, Dicer,
what are you waiting for?

22:12.299 --> 22:14.032
Hold this.

22:50.470 --> 22:55.340
I prepared myself with my
anti-mesmerizing Bat-reflector.

22:56.443 --> 22:58.810
Holy ricochet.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.913
Robin, old chum.

23:08.088 --> 23:09.954
What did you
do that for, boss?

23:09.956 --> 23:12.090
Now you'll never
get his cowl.

23:14.895 --> 23:18.062
When the plaster hardens
and is removed

23:18.064 --> 23:19.898
I'll get a mold of his cowl.

23:19.900 --> 23:24.803
Not only that, but Batman
would be permanently plastered.

23:26.740 --> 23:31.509
Oh, it's a far, far simpler end
for the cowled crusader.

23:31.511 --> 23:32.410
And the flailing knives

23:32.412 --> 23:36.147
mechanical stretchers,
cylindrical chambers

23:36.149 --> 23:39.417
acid sprays and suction fans

23:39.419 --> 23:41.519
of my hat factory.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.724
Oh, it's a stroke
of genius on my part

23:46.726 --> 23:48.126
if I do say so myself.

23:48.128 --> 23:52.563
And I'll be killing
two birds with one stone.

23:55.235 --> 23:58.736
Two birds with one stone.

24:01.274 --> 24:04.909
<i> How does Batman get out</i>
<i> of this plaster trap?</i>

24:04.911 --> 24:09.047
<i> Has the Mad Hatter</i>
<i> outwitted the Dynamic Duo</i>

24:09.049 --> 24:11.149

<i> The web of terror is just</i>
