WEBVTT

00:24.691 --> 00:26.443
Barbara?

00:30.239 --> 00:32.241
Barbara?

00:34.159 --> 00:35.786
Barbara?

00:35.869 --> 00:37.079
- So, you're...

00:37.162 --> 00:39.456
holding each other's breasts...

00:39.540 --> 00:41.667
- Boobs, yeah.
- And then you leaned in

00:41.750 --> 00:43.794
and stared into each other's eyes

00:43.877 --> 00:45.671
and it just... happened.
- Yeah.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.589
Basically, but then this morning...
- Wait.

00:47.673 --> 00:49.675
Was that it?

00:49.758 --> 00:51.969
Just... just kissing?

00:52.052 --> 00:53.262
- No, I mean, we did everything.

00:53.345 --> 00:54.972
- And when you say everything...

00:55.055 --> 00:56.807
- We went down on each other,
we fingered each other.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.225
I mean, she can't finger me,

00:58.308 --> 00:59.893
but I moved my vagina around on her...

00:59.977 --> 01:01.728
hand, kind of.
The issue is

01:01.812 --> 01:03.730
that this morning, I wake up
and she's not talking to me.

01:03.814 --> 01:05.691
She's gone.
She's not there anymore.

01:05.774 --> 01:07.109
We're supposed to finish this script.

01:07.192 --> 01:12.239
- Oh. I want you to go back
and examine what you just said.

01:12.322 --> 01:16.785
You did everything.

01:16.869 --> 01:18.078
- Jesus, Rima, we fucked.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.454
I mean, what do you want me to say?

01:19.538 --> 01:20.455
We made love, whatever.

01:20.539 --> 01:22.583
- Made love?

01:22.666 --> 01:24.459
Ah...

01:24.543 --> 01:25.669
There we go.

01:25.752 --> 01:28.797
You made love...

01:28.881 --> 01:31.133
to yourself.

01:31.216 --> 01:34.094
The two parts became one.

01:34.178 --> 01:40.100
And now, you don't need Barbara
to help you finish that script.

01:40.184 --> 01:44.521
Because you are fully self-actualized.

02:00.579 --> 02:02.539
- So then she starts threatening me.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.041
She's gonna, like, call the landlord.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.459
And the landlord fucking hates me,

02:05.542 --> 02:07.002
so I'm trying to play it cool
like, "Oh, we don't need to

02:07.085 --> 02:08.086
involve the landlord," 'cause, you know,

02:08.170 --> 02:09.630
I'm on rent control, so he would just love

02:09.713 --> 02:11.340
a reason to get rid of me.
- Whoa, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:11.423 --> 02:13.550
Calm down. Wait. This is all
because you asked her son

02:13.634 --> 02:15.385
to move a bookcase, and he hit his head?

02:15.469 --> 02:17.221
How the fuck is that your fault?
- Exactly! It isn't.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.805
That's what I'm saying.
And this little...

02:18.889 --> 02:20.349
brat, like, tattled on me,

02:20.432 --> 02:22.518
and now I'm gonna have to,
like, move to Koreatown

02:22.601 --> 02:24.895
and, like, have this
sad bachelor pad, and, like...

02:24.978 --> 02:26.146
- Or...

02:28.065 --> 02:30.275
...you can move in with me.

03:08.272 --> 03:09.731
- 'Sup, bitch?

03:12.067 --> 03:13.569
- Barbara?

03:13.652 --> 03:16.071
What the fuck?

03:16.154 --> 03:17.573
Oh, my God.
- Hi.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.867
- Barbara, yesterday you, like...

03:19.950 --> 03:21.243
you went back to being inanimate.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.536
- No, dawg, I was sleeping.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.455
- No. Really, you were, like...
- Completely zonked,

03:25.539 --> 03:26.957
because someone made me scissor them

03:27.040 --> 03:28.625
until 4:00 in the morning.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.878
And also, friend to friend,

03:30.961 --> 03:32.337
you gotta laser your pussy,

03:32.421 --> 03:35.048
'cause it is very prickly-pear down there.

03:35.132 --> 03:37.050
My tongue is, like, completely cut up.

03:37.134 --> 03:38.802
It was bleeding this morning. Look.

03:40.512 --> 03:41.930
What's wrong with you?

03:43.849 --> 03:46.560
- Um, I'm moving in with Dan.

03:47.811 --> 03:49.855
- Oh.

03:49.938 --> 03:52.065
Okay. I mean...

03:52.149 --> 03:56.445
I guess, like... I guess I'd be
okay moving back to Dan's,

03:56.528 --> 03:59.531
and, you know, if it was just,
like, a couple times a week,

03:59.615 --> 04:03.202
I'd be down to fuck him.
- No, Barbara, you're not...

04:03.285 --> 04:06.079
You can't come with me.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.789
- What?

04:09.291 --> 04:10.918
Well, then...

04:11.001 --> 04:12.961
where will I go?

04:13.045 --> 04:16.048
- I don't know, um, but I'm...
I'll figure something out.

04:16.131 --> 04:18.050
- This is totally crazy.
What do you mean

04:18.133 --> 04:20.052
you'll figure it out?
I mean...

04:20.135 --> 04:21.803
what about our script?

04:21.887 --> 04:23.096
- I don't know, I'm, like...

04:23.180 --> 04:25.098
just gonna set it aside for a while.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.975
- Gonna "set it aside"?

04:27.059 --> 04:28.769
- Yeah. You know, like,
you just set it aside,

04:28.852 --> 04:30.604
like, put it in a drawer for a while,

04:30.687 --> 04:32.814
and then when you look at it
with fresh eyes...

04:33.857 --> 04:34.983
What?
- Cody,

04:35.067 --> 04:36.276
when Susan B. Anthony was marching

04:36.360 --> 04:37.861
for a woman's right to bear arms,

04:37.945 --> 04:39.696
do you think she, like, set it all aside

04:39.780 --> 04:41.198
just to move in with her boyfriend?

04:41.281 --> 04:43.325
- Okay, that's not...
- And when Roe and Wade

04:43.408 --> 04:44.993
fought each other lo those many years ago,

04:45.077 --> 04:46.954
do you think it was about a guy, Cody?

04:47.037 --> 04:48.956
No, it wasn't.
It was not about a guy.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.667
It was about super-important,
like, feminist-y type stuff

04:51.750 --> 04:53.460
that I'm not gonna get into
with you right now,

04:53.544 --> 04:55.254
because you're literally
the worst feminist I've ever met.

04:57.005 --> 04:59.216
And you're never gonna finish your script!

04:59.299 --> 05:01.844
You're gonna keep setting it
aside and setting it aside,

05:01.927 --> 05:04.471
until one day you wake up and you realize

05:04.555 --> 05:07.683
that you have made nothing of yourself.

05:07.766 --> 05:10.394
That all you are and all you'll ever be

05:10.477 --> 05:12.396
is Dan Harmon's girlfriend,

05:12.479 --> 05:15.315
Dan Harmon's plus size, plus-one.

05:15.399 --> 05:18.777
You're a passive protagonist
in your own fuckin' life.

05:18.861 --> 05:20.779
- Fuck you!
- It's true.

05:20.863 --> 05:24.116
And every time he calls,
you drop everything to be with him.

05:24.199 --> 05:26.577
It's so sad, and it's so pathetic.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.995
But guess what, Cody?

05:28.078 --> 05:30.998
One day he is gonna get bored of you,

05:31.081 --> 05:33.709
and as soon as you get
one too many wrinkles

05:33.792 --> 05:37.838
on that tiny little forehead,
he's gonna get another plus-one,

05:37.921 --> 05:40.132
a better one, a younger one,

05:40.215 --> 05:41.383
and then...

05:41.466 --> 05:44.011
you won't even be his plus-one.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.180
You, Cody Heller...

05:46.263 --> 05:48.390
will be nothing.

05:51.101 --> 05:53.270
- I think that's everything.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.480
- Didn't you listen
to anything I just said?!

05:55.564 --> 05:57.065
- Uh... oh.
- This is bullshit!

05:57.149 --> 05:58.817
- And I'll give you my old phone.

05:58.901 --> 06:00.944
I got a new one, so you can keep this

06:01.028 --> 06:02.988
and, I don't know,
listen to music or whatever.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.823
- Phone.

06:04.907 --> 06:08.076
Play a song for when your best friend
stabs you in the back.

06:09.953 --> 06:12.164
- Um, all right.

06:12.247 --> 06:14.249
I guess I'll see you... around.

06:14.333 --> 06:16.001
Okay, bye.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.753
- You're making a huge mistake, Cody.

06:17.836 --> 06:19.922
If you'd just listen to me!
Please!

06:22.257 --> 06:24.092
Bye.

06:31.308 --> 06:32.601
- Bean, you ready?

06:32.684 --> 06:34.353
- One second!

06:34.436 --> 06:37.856
- It's a panel about a superhero
whose whole thing is clocks.

06:37.940 --> 06:39.441
I cannot be late.

06:39.525 --> 06:41.568
- Okay, okay, okay!

06:44.988 --> 06:46.740
Hello?
- Hi, Cody.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.951
I have your agent, Chet Jacobs, for you.

06:49.034 --> 06:50.953
- Who? Seriously,
the next time this happens,

06:51.036 --> 06:53.205
can you guys just give me a female agent?

06:53.288 --> 06:55.999
- Cody. Chet. How you doing?

06:56.083 --> 06:59.086
Listen, I don't know
if you heard, but Phil...

06:59.169 --> 07:01.338
Let me guess-- Phil was #MeToo'd?

07:01.421 --> 07:02.673
Uh, no.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.342
His wife has Stage IV breast cancer.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.760
- Oh.
- Yes.

07:06.844 --> 07:09.346
Anyway, I just wanted
to let you know that I loved

07:09.429 --> 07:10.764
that script of yours.

07:10.848 --> 07:12.307
It's hilarious.

07:12.391 --> 07:14.309
- What?
- And I love

07:14.393 --> 07:15.894
that you created the fake e-mail account

07:15.978 --> 07:17.771
from the sex doll character
to send it to me.

07:17.855 --> 07:20.732
BarbaraHimmelbaum@yahoo.com?
So funny.

07:20.816 --> 07:24.736
- Y-Yeah. Um, I was trying to,
uh, be like meta to... Yeah.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.363
Yeah-yeah, I do have a few thoughts.

07:26.446 --> 07:29.241
You're not so great
at writing male characters,

07:29.324 --> 07:31.785
and I got to be honest,
I don't think the Dan character

07:31.869 --> 07:34.329
would pass the...
whatever the male version

07:34.413 --> 07:36.456
of the Bechdel test is.

07:37.499 --> 07:39.126
- Uh-huh?
- Yeah.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.837
So I've got some buyers
interested in this already,

07:41.920 --> 07:44.256
but they're gonna want to hear
a full-season pitch.

07:44.339 --> 07:47.301
- Okay, great. I-I-I can get that done.
- Great.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.636
And we'll get these meetings
on the books, then.

07:58.437 --> 07:59.938
- Whassup, slut!

08:00.022 --> 08:02.357
You comin' to get me?
We have a show to write!

08:02.441 --> 08:04.610
What are you wearing?
You look like you're in,

08:04.693 --> 08:06.612
like, a high school musical production

08:06.695 --> 08:07.654
of Phantom of the Opera.

08:07.738 --> 08:08.780
- Hey, Cody, you coming?

08:08.864 --> 08:12.159
Ticktock! We got to go!

08:12.242 --> 08:14.536
- Excuse me, do you have somewhere to go?

08:14.620 --> 08:16.830
- One second, one second, one second.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.166
Hey.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.626
- Are you coming?

08:21.668 --> 08:23.045
- Uh...

08:25.547 --> 08:27.966
Just go ahead without me.

08:33.305 --> 08:36.266
My God. I'm sweating through
this blazer like a motherfucker.

08:36.350 --> 08:37.768
- I know. Jesus.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.937
- Y-You can tell?
- Uh, yeah, very much so.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.064
I can smell it, too.
Very Baja Fresh.

08:42.147 --> 08:44.483
- Dude, I'm rea...
I'm, like, really nervous.

08:44.566 --> 08:46.401
- Relax. These fucks would be
idiots not to buy this.

08:46.485 --> 08:48.070
It's gonna be, like, a really good show.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.280
- Yeah, you think?
- A thousand percent.

08:50.364 --> 08:51.448
- And, like, we have enough material

08:51.532 --> 08:52.824
for a full half hour, right?

08:52.908 --> 08:54.785
- Are you kidding?
It could honestly be an hour long.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.537
It's just, there's
too much funny stuff to commit

08:56.620 --> 08:58.455
to making it a drama.
- Yeah, yeah, you're right.

08:58.539 --> 09:00.457
- Just remember
the casting stuff, you know?

09:00.541 --> 09:03.627
I play myself, and for the role
of Cody, we're going diverse.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.838
- What?
No, I'm gonna play myself.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.172
- Cody, get serious.

09:07.256 --> 09:09.049
The last thing anyone wants right now

09:09.132 --> 09:10.926
is another show about two white girls.

09:11.009 --> 09:12.177
- Okay, well, then we'll cast,

09:12.261 --> 09:13.303
like, a diverse doll or whatever.

09:13.387 --> 09:14.596
- Fine.
- Great.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.682
- Fine. Fine, and then I'll play Cody.

09:16.765 --> 09:18.392
- How would that work?

09:18.475 --> 09:19.810
- I don't know, I'll just, like,
wear a fat suit or whatever.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.645
Oh, come on, you don't actually expect me

09:21.728 --> 09:23.105
to, like, gain weight.
- Barbara, I mean, no, okay...

09:23.188 --> 09:25.065
That-That's not what I meant,
and you know it.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.444
- That's how dedicated I am to my craft.

09:29.528 --> 09:32.447
I will gain the weight
to play the role of Cody Heller.

09:32.531 --> 09:34.533
- No. Fuck no. Fuck you,
Barbara. You're being

09:34.616 --> 09:36.577
such a little fuckin' asshole.
I hope that you just...
- Hi.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.287
- Um...

09:38.370 --> 09:40.038
hi.

09:40.122 --> 09:41.456
Um, I'm Cody.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.375
- Rude.

09:43.458 --> 09:44.918
- And this is Barbara.

09:45.002 --> 09:47.045
Thank you so much
for hearing our pitch today.

09:47.129 --> 09:49.339
- Oh. You're Dan Harmon's girlfriend.

09:49.423 --> 09:51.091
- Yes.
- He actually dated me first

09:51.175 --> 09:53.093
and was, like, way more in love with me.

09:53.177 --> 09:55.053
What? He was.

09:55.137 --> 09:57.598
Man, that guy is such a genius.
