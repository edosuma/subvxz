02:16.202 --> 02:17.340
Where are you going?

02:18.938 --> 02:20.474
Pyari, wait up!

02:20.540 --> 02:21.951
Pyari, don't go inside.

02:22.909 --> 02:24.752
Oh god, she went in!

02:40.994 --> 02:42.166
Have you gone mad?

02:42.228 --> 02:45.539
How many times have I told you
not to loiter around this mansion!

02:45.632 --> 02:48.078
Dad, Pyari..
-To hell with her!

02:48.134 --> 02:50.341
Save your life and flee from here.

02:50.403 --> 02:51.905
C'mon, do you want to die!

02:51.971 --> 02:54.747
I've repeatedly told you
not to go there! You'll get killed!

02:54.807 --> 02:55.808
C'mon!

03:13.059 --> 03:22.138
"Fun and frolic.. great and grand!"

03:22.669 --> 03:23.875
WOW!

03:45.391 --> 03:47.667
"When my eyes fell on your hips,
a hoot escaped my lips."

03:47.760 --> 03:50.104
"My nights are spent
yearning for you."

03:50.196 --> 03:52.540
"When my eyes fell on your hips,
a hoot escaped my lips."

03:52.632 --> 03:55.044
"My nights are spent
yearning for you."

03:55.101 --> 03:57.377
"If you don't yield,
your heart will compel you."

03:57.470 --> 03:59.916
"Come into my arms,
let's have some fun!"

03:59.973 --> 04:02.214
"If you don't yield,
your heart will compel you."

04:02.275 --> 04:04.915
"Come into my arms,
let's have some fun!"

04:05.178 --> 04:08.387
"Fun and frolic.."

04:09.282 --> 04:14.095
"Darling, throw a party first.
Darling, buy me a margarita."

04:14.153 --> 04:18.863
"Darling, when it gets heady,
you can do whatever you want."

04:18.958 --> 04:23.771
"Darling, take me on a long drive first.
Darling, gift me a diamond."

04:23.830 --> 04:28.904
"Darling, take me to your parents,
then you can do whatever you want."

04:29.002 --> 04:31.380
"When my eyes fell on your hips,
a hoot escaped my lips."

04:31.471 --> 04:33.849
"My nights are spent
yearning for you."

04:33.906 --> 04:36.284
"When my eyes fell on your hips,
a hoot escaped my lips."

04:36.342 --> 04:38.618
"My nights are spent
yearning for you."

04:38.711 --> 04:41.021
"If you don't yield,
your heart will compel you."

04:41.114 --> 04:43.560
"Come into my arms,
let's have some fun!"

04:43.616 --> 04:45.926
"If you don't yield,
your heart will compel you."

04:45.985 --> 04:48.363
"Come into my arms,
let's have some fun!"

04:48.855 --> 04:52.359
"Fun and frolic.."

05:02.168 --> 05:07.049
"O baby, your looks are killer.
Different is your style."

05:07.106 --> 05:11.885
"God must have made you on a Sunday.
O girl, you're mesmerising!"

05:11.978 --> 05:16.825
"O baby, your looks are killer.
Different is your style."

05:16.916 --> 05:22.093
"God must have made you on a Sunday.
O girl, you're mesmerising!"

05:22.355 --> 05:27.134
"When my eyes fell on your hips,
a hoot escaped my lips."

05:27.193 --> 05:29.605
"My nights are spent
yearning for you."

05:29.662 --> 05:32.006
"If you don't yield,
your heart will compel you."

05:32.065 --> 05:34.511
"Come into my arms,
let's have some fun!"

05:34.967 --> 05:38.471
"Fun and frolic.."

05:39.038 --> 05:43.817
"Darling, throw a party first.
Darling, buy me a margarita."

05:43.910 --> 05:48.586
"Darling, when it gets heady,
you can do whatever you want."

05:48.681 --> 05:53.528
"Darling, take me on a long drive first.
Darling, gift me a diamond."

05:53.586 --> 05:58.660
"Darling, take me to your parents,
then you can do whatever you want."

05:58.758 --> 06:01.068
"When my eyes fell on your hips,
a hoot escaped my lips."

06:01.160 --> 06:03.436
"My nights are spent
yearning for you."

06:03.529 --> 06:05.839
"If you don't yield,
your heart will compel you."

06:05.932 --> 06:08.811
"Come into my arms,
let's have some fun!"

06:08.868 --> 06:12.247
"Fun and frolic.."

06:39.098 --> 06:40.099
How long has it been ringing?

06:40.199 --> 06:43.203
Sir, the bell isn't ringing here,
but there.

06:43.669 --> 06:45.615
Oh, sorry.

06:47.673 --> 06:48.583
Have you had this problem before?

06:48.674 --> 06:49.584
No.

06:49.675 --> 06:51.484
Family history?
-Not at all.

06:52.178 --> 06:53.418
Let me check.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.732
My wife.

07:04.190 --> 07:05.362
Hi baby!

07:05.425 --> 07:06.563
Hi sweetheart!

07:06.793 --> 07:09.603
Do you remember that
we've to visit the guru today?

07:09.695 --> 07:13.575
Oh, I'm so sorry. I have
a patient waiting, I can't come.

07:13.633 --> 07:15.442
But baby, I had told you“

07:16.235 --> 07:17.213
Listen up!

07:17.270 --> 07:20.080
We've to leave for the
guru's place in an hour.

07:20.139 --> 07:21.846
Damn yuu!

07:21.908 --> 07:23.649
Stand straight.
-What did you say?

07:23.709 --> 07:25.279
No, I mean I can't come.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.289
Look, stop being stubborn.

07:28.347 --> 07:29.849
Stop it, sir!

07:29.916 --> 07:31.486
I won't!

07:32.285 --> 07:35.323
You've to visit the guru or else..

07:35.388 --> 07:41.862
Look, mom-in-law,
I'm not going to let you crush me!

07:42.161 --> 07:44.607
Then get out of my house.

07:44.664 --> 07:47.804
I'll be there in an hour.
-That's like it.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.680
Oh, you're suffering from hernia.

07:56.108 --> 07:58.782
I didn't have it before
the check-up, sir.

08:08.087 --> 08:11.591
Life's changing every moment.

08:11.691 --> 08:14.365
Somewhere life's pleasure,
somewhere it's pain.

08:14.427 --> 08:17.636
Hence, live to the
fullest every moment.

08:17.730 --> 08:20.574
This mood and moment
will never come back.

08:21.601 --> 08:27.051
Out.. out“ run out!

08:27.106 --> 08:30.383
Wow! The guru is sharing
such great knowledge.

08:30.476 --> 08:33.548
He's not sharing knowledge,
but testing my patience.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.315
Sire..
-Yes?

08:35.381 --> 08:39.921
Since you've said that my late husband
wishes to return to this world..

08:39.986 --> 08:41.795
...that too through
my daughter's womb..

08:41.954 --> 08:45.663
...I've made a total
donation of 12.5 millions.

08:45.758 --> 08:49.672
See that? Her patience is
being put through a test of fire.

08:49.962 --> 08:53.432
There has been no news of her beloved.

08:53.699 --> 08:57.670
Yes, sire. Until dad doesn't
tell you the time of his arrival..

08:57.737 --> 09:01.514
...I've not let him even touch
me until then, just like you advised.

09:01.607 --> 09:04.816
The one who has to come, will come.

09:04.877 --> 09:06.447
Damn your lie!

09:06.879 --> 09:10.292
I mean, he'll be here in an hour.
It's already been six months.

09:10.383 --> 09:14.388
Master, it's time
to contact the spirits.

09:15.087 --> 09:17.931
'Fearless and brave.'

09:20.293 --> 09:22.398
Your husband's name?
-RavL

09:22.461 --> 09:23.633
Shastri, the cricketer?

09:23.696 --> 09:24.766
Oh god, when did he die?

09:24.864 --> 09:26.070
Ravi Mehra.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.943
Ok, Mehra.

09:30.403 --> 09:34.943
'Come, let's find the road to love.'

09:46.018 --> 09:49.898
Come.. come..

09:49.989 --> 09:50.899
What happened, sire?

09:50.957 --> 09:54.871
The communication is breaking, I
think the offering was a little less.

09:54.927 --> 09:57.339
No, don't do that!
I'm willing to spend.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.602
Give it, dear.

09:58.798 --> 10:01.176
Here, try once again.

10:01.233 --> 10:03.941
Praise the lord!

10:09.942 --> 10:14.413
Come.. come..

10:14.480 --> 10:16.153
It seems the communication
is breaking again.

10:16.215 --> 10:19.628
Don't stop,
I'm willing to give everything.

10:19.685 --> 10:23.690
Come.. come..

10:23.756 --> 10:28.262
Come.. come..

10:28.327 --> 10:34.676
Come.. come..

10:36.669 --> 10:40.207
Here he is. Shower him with petals!

10:40.373 --> 10:42.614
Your beloved has arrived,
wearing slippers.

10:42.675 --> 10:44.086
He's here?
-Yes, Ravi.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.349
He's come?
-Yes.

10:45.444 --> 10:47.947
Master, ask dad-in-law
about the time of his arrival.

10:48.047 --> 10:49.117
Just a second.

10:49.215 --> 10:51.252
Since you've arrived in the world,
you've to live.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.160
If life's poison,
you'll have to drink it.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.923
He says, between 7.00 to 7.30 p.m.

10:55.988 --> 10:58.434
You'll have to keep your word, oldie.

10:58.524 --> 11:01.869
And you'll have to
accept this blessing.

11:01.927 --> 11:03.099
I'm not eating this.

11:03.195 --> 11:05.175
Dare you refuse the guru!
Don't forget.

11:05.264 --> 11:06.641
Yes, I know that I live in your house.

11:06.732 --> 11:08.336
Yes.

11:09.468 --> 11:10.572
I'll leave now.

11:11.971 --> 11:13.450
Do come again.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.486
Master, you've given him
a sweetmeat laced with opium..

11:16.575 --> 11:19.852
...marijuana, hashish and heroin.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.523
Now see him perform.

11:28.220 --> 11:30.496
Darling, I'm ready.

11:30.556 --> 11:33.560
What have you done to yourself?
What's with your look?

11:33.926 --> 11:35.997
Mom, come quickly.

11:36.095 --> 11:38.701
What is the matter?
Why are you shouting? -Look at this.

11:41.300 --> 11:42.836
What have you done to yourself?

11:43.569 --> 11:45.207
Aren't you ashamed?

11:48.374 --> 11:52.015
Why are you spitting?
Have you gone mad?

11:53.813 --> 11:55.656
Darling, why are you acting crazy?

11:55.715 --> 11:57.126
I've been trying to explain to you“

11:57.183 --> 11:59.891
Don't bother,
he's not going to understand.

12:01.787 --> 12:04.529
Baby, please.
It's time for dad's arrival. Hurry up.

12:04.623 --> 12:05.601
Hurry up for what?

12:05.658 --> 12:07.467
He's been bitted by a mad dog.

12:07.526 --> 12:09.028
That's why he's behaving like this.

12:11.197 --> 12:12.904
Please baby, hurry up.

12:22.508 --> 12:24.510
But with whom?

12:25.177 --> 12:30.525
Over here, the penthouse is beautiful
and the basement is dilapidated.

12:32.318 --> 12:34.764
And here,
it's evergreen at the bottom.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.325
...and barren at the top.

12:37.389 --> 12:38.231
What?!

12:38.290 --> 12:41.965
This guru has given
a very bad exchange offer.

12:42.027 --> 12:44.007
I think it's up to me now.

12:48.634 --> 12:51.410
You're going to be reborn today, baby.

12:51.470 --> 12:52.414
Move!

12:54.874 --> 12:56.410
Hey, why are you shouting?

12:56.475 --> 12:58.751
Let's hack off the head, we'll celebrate
the wedding night after that.

13:06.919 --> 13:10.924
Instead of inviting
my husband back home..

13:11.023 --> 13:13.060
...you were trying
to send me to heaven!

13:13.125 --> 13:15.503
Even the auspicious time has passed.

13:15.928 --> 13:19.569
Tonight, you're going
to sleep here on the street.

13:23.402 --> 13:27.578
Sir, when you see the penthouse..

13:27.640 --> 13:30.086
...you'll buy it immediately.

13:32.645 --> 13:33.453
Hello?

13:33.546 --> 13:37.016
Hey Prem,
sell-off my mansion at Doodhwadi.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.523
I can't live at my
mom-in-law's house anymore.

13:39.618 --> 13:43.589
Amar, I'm driving right now.
I'm with a client.

13:43.689 --> 13:44.599
We'll talk later, 0k?

13:44.657 --> 13:47.661
You're an expert con.

13:47.726 --> 13:50.969
You manage to sell the worst houses.

13:52.031 --> 13:53.169
What nonsense are you talking, Amar?

13:53.232 --> 13:56.702
You're a rascal of the first order!

13:57.002 --> 14:02.315
To earn your commission, you even
sell off a tenthouse for a penthouse.

14:02.808 --> 14:04.754
Amar, what nonsense are you talking?

14:06.612 --> 14:08.285
He was joking.

14:11.083 --> 14:13.723
Here's your tent.. penthouse.

14:16.355 --> 14:19.268
Amar, you scoundrel!

14:19.625 --> 14:23.767
Amar, you moron!
Cursed dog! He ruined my deal!

14:23.863 --> 14:25.706
Brother-in-law, statue! - Hi..

14:26.098 --> 14:28.738
You've to remain stiff now.

14:29.468 --> 14:31.038
Tickle.. tickle..

14:34.039 --> 14:35.746
Tickle.. tickle..

14:36.475 --> 14:42.892
Tickle.. tickle..

14:47.119 --> 14:48.257
You shook!

14:49.288 --> 14:52.132
You shook!

14:52.191 --> 14:54.296
Sister, come quickly.
Look, Prem shook.

14:54.493 --> 14:56.404
Sister, come fast. See, Prem shook.

14:56.495 --> 14:58.372
What's this? Why are you screaming?

14:58.430 --> 14:59.602
What's all the noise about?

14:59.665 --> 15:01.201
See..
-Shut up!

15:01.300 --> 15:02.301
Nothing.

15:02.368 --> 15:04.905
It's good that you came. I
wanted to talk to you about something.

15:04.970 --> 15:06.506
What is it?

15:06.572 --> 15:08.449
I want some money.

15:08.540 --> 15:09.575
How much?

15:09.642 --> 15:10.484
Just a million.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.852
A million! Have you gone mad?

15:12.945 --> 15:14.583
Money doesn't grow on trees.

15:14.813 --> 15:17.191
Actually,
Choti has a course in London.

15:17.349 --> 15:19.454
She has to go and live
there for two months.

15:19.652 --> 15:22.132
What?! Choti has to live
separately for two months?

15:22.221 --> 15:23.632
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

15:23.689 --> 15:25.498
I'll try and sell
a house tomorrow itself.

15:26.025 --> 15:30.064
Yeah! I'll go and tell
all my friends right away.

15:30.129 --> 15:31.369
You're the best!

15:33.299 --> 15:34.505
Bye, Prem.

15:34.833 --> 15:36.176
Bye.

15:37.336 --> 15:39.577
Your feelings for my sisten.
-Yes?

15:39.638 --> 15:41.640
...I appreciate it a lot.

15:41.740 --> 15:43.378
What do you mean?

15:43.909 --> 15:46.446
She's my sister,
but you considered her your own..

15:46.512 --> 15:48.185
...and agreed to give
her a million rupees.

15:48.247 --> 15:50.318
Yes, but you don't
understand my feelings.

15:50.416 --> 15:54.421
Since your sister came to live with us,
we've been living like siblings.

15:55.454 --> 15:58.958
"Come, get into my blanket."

15:59.058 --> 16:00.935
Welcome to my blanket.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.368
Choti!
-Choti? Ignore her.

16:03.462 --> 16:04.338
I can't ignore her.

16:04.430 --> 16:07.877
No, please don't.. Choti!

16:09.935 --> 16:12.108
What is it, Choti?
-I'm feeling very scared.

16:12.438 --> 16:14.315
I saw a very bad dream.

16:14.373 --> 16:15.545
I won't sleep alone.

16:15.607 --> 16:17.848
I want to sleep between you and Prem.

16:19.445 --> 16:20.287
What happened?

16:20.379 --> 16:22.655
Sister, there's a rat in your bed.
It rubbed against me.

16:22.748 --> 16:24.591
No, Choti. There is no rat on the bed.

16:24.650 --> 16:25.628
There is. I want to check.

16:25.684 --> 16:26.992
No, Choti..
-Yes.

16:27.052 --> 16:29.623
Yes.
-No.

16:30.856 --> 16:32.529
Choti, don't worry.

16:32.624 --> 16:36.071
Even if there was a rat,
it ran back into the hole in fear.

16:36.528 --> 16:40.499
Nisha, you both can sleep here,
I'll sleep outside. Ok?

16:41.633 --> 16:44.807
What do I do? She's a kid,
she doesn't understand all this.

16:44.870 --> 16:46.781
Just let her go to London once..

16:46.839 --> 16:50.878
...and I promise that every night
will be a wedding night for us.

16:50.943 --> 16:53.253
Really? If that is so..

16:53.312 --> 16:55.883
...then I'll surely sell
the house to Pawan Lodha tomorrow.

16:56.749 --> 16:59.730
Good morning,
Mr. and Mrs. Lodha. Welcome!

16:59.818 --> 17:04.062
You won't find a better bungalow
than this to start your married life.

17:04.289 --> 17:06.701
Come, I'll show you the
special features of this bungalow.

17:06.792 --> 17:07.827
Please come.
-Sure.

17:07.893 --> 17:10.897
See this,
a lake in front of the bungalow.

17:10.963 --> 17:12.670
A valley in front of the lake.

17:12.731 --> 17:16.645
And most important,
a hill in front of the valley.

17:18.570 --> 17:21.141
Well, what's so special
about this hill?

17:22.674 --> 17:26.247
This is the mountain where
if a man loudly shouts his name..

17:26.345 --> 17:27.847
...then do you know what happens?

17:28.213 --> 17:31.194
The hill replies
with his lover's name.

17:31.950 --> 17:34.328
Wow! Really?

17:34.420 --> 17:35.899
I'll try.

17:35.954 --> 17:37.297
Please try.

17:37.656 --> 17:39.658
Pawan!

17:39.725 --> 17:44.697
Ritu.. Ritu!

17:45.931 --> 17:48.377
Wow, Mr. Lodha!

17:48.901 --> 17:51.438
Sorry.. see, I told you.

17:52.271 --> 17:53.272
You're right.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.413
Darling,
why don't you also try? Please.

17:56.508 --> 17:57.612
Try, Mrs. Lodha.

17:58.877 --> 18:00.356
Ritu!

18:00.412 --> 18:05.088
Sahil.. Vikas.. Mohit..

18:05.184 --> 18:10.998
Shekhan. Anil.. Ramesh.. Rohan..

18:11.056 --> 18:15.596
Rakesh.. Sunil.. Moti..

18:15.694 --> 18:19.904
Manoj.. Sheela.. Sonia..
-Girls?

18:19.998 --> 18:25.380
Pawan! Pawan!

18:25.737 --> 18:28.411
Pawan!
-Pawan?!

18:28.507 --> 18:29.986
Kancha.

18:30.042 --> 18:32.682
Hey Amol! Chotu!

18:32.778 --> 18:34.382
PaPP"~

18:34.446 --> 18:42.092
Garbage collecton. Watchman..
Newspaper boy.. milkman..

18:44.189 --> 18:46.965
Listen to me, Mr. Lodha.

18:52.464 --> 18:56.571
Please save me, brother!
You're my friend.. I need a million.

18:56.668 --> 18:58.739
I have to send my sister-in-law
to London for higher studies.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.442
Please save me.

19:00.506 --> 19:01.507
What is it? What are you staring at?

19:01.573 --> 19:02.745
Is your mother getting married?
Get lost!

19:02.841 --> 19:04.445
Bloody scoundrel! -Prem,
he's my customer. What are you doing?

19:04.510 --> 19:05.716
Please save me.
Give me a million rupees.

19:05.777 --> 19:07.120
Where do I bring a million from?

19:07.179 --> 19:09.386
I'm just the manager of this hotel.
It doesn't belong to my father.

19:09.715 --> 19:12.491
Prem, you should be happy.
-Why?

19:12.551 --> 19:15.623
You have a hot sister-in-law
at home to feast your eyes on.

19:15.721 --> 19:17.667
I have a bull in my house.
-Bull?

19:17.756 --> 19:19.997
Yes, my brother-in-law.

19:25.797 --> 19:28.573
He came down for two months to
participate in a wrestling competition.

19:28.667 --> 19:31.580
He's been holed up in
my house for six months now.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.980
Have you seen the movie 'Judwa'?
-Yes, why?

19:34.072 --> 19:35.574
It's the same problem, man.

19:35.674 --> 19:39.713
My wife and my brother-in-law
are twins. Cross-connection.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.949
When I touch my wife..

19:42.014 --> 19:44.722
...my brother-in-law gets hot.

19:45.050 --> 19:46.859
Oh.. no..

19:57.062 --> 19:58.837
Ouch“
-Ouch!

20:16.248 --> 20:18.888
What am I doing? Meet!

20:20.252 --> 20:25.031
Oh god!
-Leave my sister alone!

20:27.526 --> 20:30.939
Meet, you mean to say that
your life is hell too? -Yes.

20:32.831 --> 20:34.037
Wife's calling.

20:34.833 --> 20:35.641
Hi, darling.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.839
Honey, guess what?

20:37.936 --> 20:38.812
What?

20:38.904 --> 20:41.544
Brother has gone out to
chill with his friends tonight.

20:41.607 --> 20:43.382
And he's out the entire night.

20:43.442 --> 20:45.683
The line's clear. Come home quickly.

20:45.877 --> 20:48.653
Oh baby, I'm coming!

20:49.047 --> 20:50.253
Prem..
-You got the one million?

20:50.315 --> 20:51.988
No, my arrangements have been made.

20:52.050 --> 20:54.087
You can sit here and
think about your withdrawal.

20:54.152 --> 20:56.154
I'm going home to deposit.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.496
To deposit.

20:58.557 --> 21:00.127
Meet, you bloody cheat!

21:01.360 --> 21:05.809
Oh baby, we've got
a chance after six months.

21:05.897 --> 21:07.934
Your brother will party there..

21:08.000 --> 21:11.311
...and we'll have fun
and frolic here all night.

21:12.671 --> 21:15.379
Let's go wild, baby. Let's go wild.

21:21.680 --> 21:26.390
You dog! How dare you mock my lisp!

21:40.032 --> 21:42.444
Leave me! What are you doing?

21:54.880 --> 21:56.382
Power slam!

21:59.217 --> 22:03.165
Oh god, they're shattered!

22:07.292 --> 22:09.795
I'm done for!

22:11.263 --> 22:13.106
Baby“ baby“

22:13.165 --> 22:16.977
Baby.. -I'm not fit
to give you a baby anymore.

22:17.069 --> 22:19.174
I'm so sorry.

22:51.403 --> 22:53.747
Gently, dude!

22:54.005 --> 22:56.212
I'm doing it.

23:01.513 --> 23:03.322
It's gangrene.
-Gangrene?!

23:03.382 --> 23:04.759
We'll have to chop it off.
-Chop?!

23:04.816 --> 23:06.625
Prem, scissors.
-Yes, doctor.

23:08.653 --> 23:09.597
Here, doctor.
-What are you doing?

23:09.654 --> 23:11.031
Solve his problem in one snipe.

23:12.357 --> 23:13.461
Prem, hold his hands.
-Yes, doctor.

23:13.525 --> 23:16.472
No way! Nobody's chopping
anything, get it?

23:19.297 --> 23:22.835
You guys are such rascals.
You're mocking my condition.

23:23.535 --> 23:26.539
You went to deposit,
but returned with your account closed.

23:26.605 --> 23:27.743
I asked you for a
million and you refused.

23:27.806 --> 23:30.047
You want a million?
-Yes.

23:30.142 --> 23:31.780
I'll give it.
-ReaHy?

23:31.843 --> 23:34.084
Yes, just sell my
mansion in Doodhwadi.

23:34.179 --> 23:36.887
After a 99-year lease,
it's finally come to me.

23:36.982 --> 23:38.427
Will you take another
hundred years to sell it?

23:38.483 --> 23:40.520
No, I'll call up right away.

23:45.590 --> 23:47.866
Hello, I'm Dalal speaking.

23:47.926 --> 23:51.430
You.. Mr. Dalal, what happened
to the mansion at Doodhwadi?

23:51.630 --> 23:55.009
Sir, I'm standing
outside your mansion.

23:55.100 --> 23:58.104
But I don't know why
nobody's willing to come here.

23:58.336 --> 24:00.145
But you don't worry.

24:00.205 --> 24:02.583
I won't rest till I
generate some leads today.

24:02.741 --> 24:03.947
Hurry up or..

24:05.977 --> 24:08.184
Sir, the client is here.
I'll hang up now.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.188
Welcome, sir.

24:11.583 --> 24:12.527
Please come.

24:12.918 --> 24:14.192
Welcome, sir.

24:21.893 --> 24:23.702
This mansion is very
old and badly maintained.

24:23.795 --> 24:27.709
Oh sir, this was a palace
for the kings in the olden days.

24:27.766 --> 24:29.768
Just take a step in.

24:34.105 --> 24:36.847
Come.. come, my darling.

24:38.677 --> 24:42.682
Come inside, my dear.
Come in, just once.

24:43.582 --> 24:46.791
Just once..

24:47.052 --> 24:49.999
No, I don't feel like it.
Let's check out some other bungalow.

24:50.055 --> 24:52.092
Sir.. listen to me, sir..

25:08.440 --> 25:10.977
Can I get some tea! Tea please!

25:13.144 --> 25:15.750
Nobody even asks me
for tea in this house.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.320
Sir, your tea.

25:21.653 --> 25:22.961
But who are you?

25:23.755 --> 25:25.757
I'm your new maid, Shiney.

25:28.660 --> 25:29.661
Nice name.

25:32.664 --> 25:34.974
Here's some fritters
to go with the tea.

25:36.801 --> 25:38.371
The aroma is nice.

25:42.307 --> 25:45.516
Wow, the fritters are delicious.
You deserve a tip.

25:45.844 --> 25:47.221
Here's fifty bucks. -No, sir..

25:47.279 --> 25:49.020
C'mon, keep it.

25:54.653 --> 25:56.690
The fritters are very nice.

25:56.788 --> 25:58.324
I've never eaten such
fritters in my life.

25:58.423 --> 26:00.596
Just a minute. Here..

26:01.393 --> 26:03.964
Hundred.. two.. keep this.
-No..

26:04.029 --> 26:05.030
Keep it.
-Thank you. .

26:07.299 --> 26:09.973
Such delicious fritters. wow!

26:13.405 --> 26:14.975
Keep this. Take it.

26:18.376 --> 26:21.619
What a.. fritter!

26:27.052 --> 26:29.965
Enough, sir. My blouse will tear open.

26:30.555 --> 26:31.761
Then let it tear.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.981
What is this for, sir?

26:48.373 --> 26:51.445
If your blouse tears,
you can use this to stitch it.

26:53.712 --> 26:57.956
C'mon, sir.. had I known
that it's so easy to make money..

26:58.016 --> 27:00.053
...then I'd have returned
from Doodwad earlier itself.

27:00.151 --> 27:02.563
Doodhwadi?
-Yes, my village.

27:03.154 --> 27:05.600
Doodhwadi is my village too.

27:05.657 --> 27:07.432
ReaHy?
-Yes.

27:07.492 --> 27:11.099
Then it's my duty to serve you nicely.

27:11.363 --> 27:14.435
Tell me, what all can I do for you?

27:26.277 --> 27:30.726
Thank you for calling us over, buddy.

27:32.350 --> 27:34.455
Enjoy the show, my friends.

28:12.991 --> 28:17.371
"I floored you by wearing lipstick."

28:17.429 --> 28:21.434
"I looked into your eyes,
it caused a heart attack."

28:21.833 --> 28:25.838
"O darling.. O darling.."

28:26.171 --> 28:30.551
"O darling.. O darling.."

28:30.608 --> 28:34.852
"I floored you by wearing lipstick."

28:34.946 --> 28:38.985
"I looked into your eyes,
it caused a heart attack."

28:39.384 --> 28:43.696
"O darling.. O darling.."

28:43.788 --> 28:47.702
"O darling.. O darling.."

29:05.677 --> 29:09.716
"You look awesome and fashionable."

29:09.781 --> 29:14.389
"You sculpt your figure in the gym,
only to kill us."

29:14.452 --> 29:18.764
"Your booty like apples.
Your legs compliment them."

29:18.823 --> 29:23.169
"Your lips are like candy,
I feel helpless."

29:23.228 --> 29:27.574
"Come, it's a season of love.
There's no reason to abstain."

29:27.665 --> 29:31.943
"Open up..
open the door to your heart."

29:32.036 --> 29:36.348
"You're a hottie,
my desires are naughty."

29:36.407 --> 29:41.015
"Come, let's get flirty.
Give in to your emotions."

29:41.112 --> 29:45.424
"C'mon, my sexy lady,
let's make some love tonight."

29:45.517 --> 29:49.556
"You've got me going crazy.
I wanna hold you tight."

29:49.621 --> 29:53.933
"O darling.. O darling.."

29:54.025 --> 29:58.235
"O darling.. O darling.."

29:58.296 --> 30:02.403
"You floored me by wearing lipstick."

30:02.767 --> 30:07.147
"You looked into my eyes,
it caused a heart attack."

30:07.205 --> 30:11.517
"O darling.. O darling.."

30:11.576 --> 30:15.854
"O darling.. O darling.."

30:15.947 --> 30:19.952
"I floored you by wearing lipstick."

30:20.385 --> 30:24.663
"I looked into your eyes,
it caused a heart attack."

30:24.722 --> 30:29.034
"O darling.. O darling.."

30:29.093 --> 30:33.371
"O darling.. O darling.."

30:37.936 --> 30:40.075
"..by wearing lipstick."

30:43.174 --> 30:44.676
"I floored you.."

30:58.623 --> 31:00.660
Bloody Amar 'Sucking' Saxena!

31:01.092 --> 31:04.869
Your mom-in-law screwed
up all our moods today.

31:04.929 --> 31:08.069
She just screwed up the mood today.

31:08.166 --> 31:11.375
Normally, she gangs up
with the guru and screws me.

31:11.469 --> 31:16.942
And that guru presents
song verses as his teachings.

31:17.008 --> 31:19.818
...and is making a fool out of my wife.

31:19.911 --> 31:24.758
Be grateful that atleast your
wife doesn't have a twin brother.

31:24.983 --> 31:29.329
I plug one's phone and
the other's battery gets charged.

31:30.021 --> 31:33.059
The common saying is that
the sister-in-law is half a wife.

31:33.224 --> 31:35.033
In my case,
the brother-in-law is half a husband!

31:35.093 --> 31:37.334
Don't talk about the sister-in-law.

31:37.428 --> 31:41.501
My sister-in-law is not a bone in
the throat but a juicy steak herself.

31:42.133 --> 31:46.604
When she was young, she'd
sit on the lap and eat a lollypop.

31:46.838 --> 31:48.784
Now when she sits on the lap..

31:48.840 --> 31:51.582
--M'l lolly pops out.

31:51.643 --> 31:53.486
This is the first bed in the world..

31:53.578 --> 31:56.889
...where my wife's
sister sleeps with us.

31:57.181 --> 32:01.152
Our condition is such
that forget the feast.

32:01.219 --> 32:03.256
...we don't even get regular meals!

32:11.596 --> 32:15.942
Friends, I have an idea.

32:16.668 --> 32:21.515
I have a great, grand idea!

32:22.707 --> 32:24.550
No, no.
-Yes, yes.

32:24.609 --> 32:26.452
No, no.
-Yes, yes.

32:26.544 --> 32:28.080
No, no..
-Shut up!

32:29.247 --> 32:33.093
We're going to enjoy
a feast this time.

32:33.484 --> 32:37.057
This time we won't be playing
golf with downtown girls..

32:37.121 --> 32:42.503
...but playing softball
with village belles instead!

32:42.827 --> 32:44.966
Village? Which village?

32:45.229 --> 32:47.038
Doodhwadi.

32:47.131 --> 32:48.371
That's my native.

32:49.067 --> 32:50.705
Why Doodhwadi?

32:52.003 --> 32:56.008
Because in Doodhwadi, the
moment someone buys your bungalow..

32:56.207 --> 32:59.984
...you can bid goodbye
to your mom-in-law's house.

33:00.511 --> 33:03.617
We'll only sell his
bungalow at Doodhwadi.

33:03.948 --> 33:08.829
How will we get to
relish a rural feast?

33:08.886 --> 33:13.460
In Doodhwadi, there isn't just
one Shiney, but thousands of Shineys.

33:13.524 --> 33:18.439
Smiling Shiney,
washing Shiney, bathing Shiney..

33:18.496 --> 33:19.941
Towelling Shiney..

33:20.064 --> 33:23.568
A Shiney here and a Shiney there!

33:23.668 --> 33:25.272
What do you think?
-Correct.

33:25.336 --> 33:29.978
We'll get to enjoy in Doodhwadi on
the pretext of selling the bungalow.

33:30.041 --> 33:33.750
Yes. And this time it
won't just be fun and frolic..

33:33.978 --> 33:36.151
...but great fun and frolic!

33:36.280 --> 33:40.456
Such great fun and frolic that
the world will be left wide-eyed.

33:40.518 --> 33:43.397
Wide-eyed!
-Wide-eyed!

33:43.454 --> 33:46.833
So Doodhwadi, here we come.

34:20.224 --> 34:22.204
Doodhwadi?
-Yes.

34:22.260 --> 34:24.672
It's your ancestral bungalow,
you go to sell it yourself.

34:24.929 --> 34:28.467
It's your friend. You can go
and get pally in such a rotten place.

34:28.733 --> 34:31.111
Is this Doodhwadi
even marked on the map?

34:33.771 --> 34:36.843
I told you, whether we go to
Doodhwadi or up the donkey's rear..

34:36.941 --> 34:39.046
...it won't make a
difference to our wives.

34:39.577 --> 34:41.750
Yes, wives become
suspicious only when“

34:41.813 --> 34:44.794
...we go to Bangkok for work.

34:45.883 --> 34:47.487
Hey, look ahead!

34:59.163 --> 35:00.574
Are you alright?
-Yes, I am.

35:00.665 --> 35:03.145
Ok, step outside. Let's check the car.

35:05.136 --> 35:07.582
Open it.
-It's hot.

35:08.940 --> 35:12.217
Oh no, it's badly damaged.
-Shit!

35:12.310 --> 35:14.847
That reminds me,
I want to shit urgently.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.448
You want to shit in such a time!

35:16.547 --> 35:18.823
Go there, behind the rocks.
-Water..

35:18.916 --> 35:20.020
What do we do now?

35:20.084 --> 35:21.427
Waten.

35:22.186 --> 35:23.221
ControL.

35:33.931 --> 35:37.811
Oh my god! Snake! Snake!

35:37.902 --> 35:39.176
What happened?

35:39.270 --> 35:40.613
Why are you screaming 'snake?

35:40.705 --> 35:43.379
A snake bit me on the butt.
-What?

35:43.975 --> 35:46.251
The poison has already
started spreading. -Oh god!

35:46.344 --> 35:48.051
I'm feeling giddy.

35:48.146 --> 35:51.650
I'm going to die.
-No, nothing will happen to you.

35:51.749 --> 35:53.057
I'm there. We'll think of something.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.721
There must surely
be a way to save you.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.924
There's one way.
- What?

35:57.021 --> 36:00.901
You both have to suck the
venom out of my butt. - What?!

36:00.992 --> 36:03.598
Have you gone mad?
I'm not going to suck your butt.

36:03.661 --> 36:06.870
The poison is taking effect.
The world is vanishing before my eyes.

36:06.964 --> 36:09.240
Everything around me is darkening.

36:09.300 --> 36:12.713
Remove your goggles,
the darkness will disappear.

36:12.770 --> 36:16.980
For the sake of our friendship,
please suck on it.

36:17.074 --> 36:19.748
Why did the snake have
to bite you on the butt!

36:19.810 --> 36:21.983
Thank god the snake
bit him on the butt..

36:22.046 --> 36:25.584
...think what you'd have to suck
on if it bit him on the front! -Oh no!

36:26.184 --> 36:29.791
Goodbye, I'm going.

36:29.854 --> 36:31.458
Wait, we'll suck on it.

36:31.556 --> 36:32.660
Meet, suck it.
-Ok.

36:33.324 --> 36:34.598
What? Why should I suck?

36:34.659 --> 36:35.865
You're an expert at sucking.

36:35.927 --> 36:38.806
Remember how you used
to suck your thumb as a kid.

36:39.597 --> 36:41.201
You're no less of
an expert at sucking.

36:41.299 --> 36:43.779
I've seen you suck out entire
mango and leave behind the seed.

36:43.868 --> 36:47.509
Those were mangoes, but this
is a watermelon. C'mon, suck it.

36:47.572 --> 36:51.543
People die laughing,
I'm going to die shitting.

36:51.609 --> 36:53.111
Suck it, you rascals!

36:53.177 --> 36:55.453
Yes, we'll suck it. Bend down.

36:55.646 --> 36:57.091
I'll suck it.

37:03.988 --> 37:07.231
You idiot,
you weren't bitten by a snake.

37:07.291 --> 37:09.635
A 'coctus' was stuck to your rear.
-Cactus.

37:09.694 --> 37:10.968
Yes, cactus.

37:11.762 --> 37:13.867
I've been saved!

37:13.965 --> 37:15.535
You nearly died.

37:15.633 --> 37:17.271
And I nearly sucked.

37:19.737 --> 37:22.513
Hey, it's a wagon!

37:23.274 --> 37:24.753
Wait! Wait!

37:30.982 --> 37:32.484
Doodhwadi!

37:33.884 --> 37:35.295
Thank you, sir.

37:36.053 --> 37:38.932
Doodhwadi.
Let's milk this opportunity, guys.

37:50.601 --> 37:54.014
Village belles..
-Smooth like butter.

38:12.456 --> 38:14.231
Look at that.

38:18.629 --> 38:19.733
Beautiful pots.

38:19.830 --> 38:22.037
DoodhwadL. Doodhwadi, I love you!

38:22.600 --> 38:25.774
I love Doodhwadi. I love pottery.

38:28.005 --> 38:30.349
I love pottery.
I love your beautiful pots.

38:32.777 --> 38:34.051
Yughurt!

38:38.516 --> 38:39.927
WOW!

38:40.351 --> 38:43.457
Creamy yoghurt!

38:51.896 --> 38:53.933
Doodhwadi.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.946
Thank you, sir.
-Doodhwadi.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.274
Guys, let's milk this opportunity.

39:14.018 --> 39:17.056
Village belles..
-Stale as bread.

39:17.121 --> 39:18.896
What to do now?

39:29.166 --> 39:31.009
Look at that.

39:35.239 --> 39:37.583
Doodhwadi. I don't like Doodhwadi.

39:37.641 --> 39:39.450
A pot of gold in the dreams..
-Is shockingly old in reality.

39:39.543 --> 39:42.046
Oh god, where have you brought us!

39:46.384 --> 39:47.954
Even the yoghurt!

39:50.221 --> 39:51.962
Drink some yoghurt, dear.

39:52.623 --> 39:54.068
No way!

39:54.125 --> 39:55.229
You drink, dear.

39:55.292 --> 39:56.669
I don't want your yoghurt.

39:57.128 --> 40:00.905
Every packet of milk
here has expired ages ago.

40:00.965 --> 40:04.276
Forget the milk, even the
yoghurt here is a century old.

40:04.368 --> 40:06.746
Is this your native
place or the Jurassic park?

40:06.804 --> 40:08.579
Where are all the young girls?

40:08.639 --> 40:10.209
I'll tell you!

40:16.647 --> 40:19.253
All the young girls of the
village have gone to the city..

40:19.316 --> 40:21.023
...to work as maids.

40:21.085 --> 40:22.894
What?!
-What?

40:24.121 --> 40:25.099
Who are you?

40:25.156 --> 40:28.603
I'm the chieftain
of this village, Ramsay.

40:28.692 --> 40:30.831
What? Your name is Ramsay?

40:30.928 --> 40:33.499
Yes. We were three brothers.

40:33.564 --> 40:37.307
Ramsay brothers. Two went away..

40:37.401 --> 40:39.005
...I'm the only one left, Ramsay.

40:39.069 --> 40:41.174
How did your brothers die?

40:41.238 --> 40:42.683
They haven't died!

40:44.308 --> 40:46.879
They went to the city to work.

40:48.446 --> 40:52.656
By the way, why have you
come to this barren, deserted..

40:52.716 --> 40:56.357
...graveyard of a village? Why?

40:58.556 --> 41:00.934
Brother Ramsay,
we've come here on some work too.

41:01.025 --> 41:02.698
I want to sell my ancestral bungalow.

41:02.760 --> 41:04.137
Which bungalow?

41:07.031 --> 41:07.839
This one.

41:11.702 --> 41:15.411
Satan's area! Old bungalow!

41:15.973 --> 41:19.079
Terror! The chime of the anklets!

41:19.910 --> 41:21.412
What's all this?

41:21.479 --> 41:23.083
Titles of horror films.

41:24.381 --> 41:27.919
But films are inspired by real life.

41:28.018 --> 41:32.057
The mansion that you've
come to sell is haunted.

41:33.491 --> 41:36.665
Amar, I think that,
just like your guru..

41:36.727 --> 41:39.003
...this guy is also
making a fool out of us.

41:39.763 --> 41:43.336
Ramsay, please explain in detail,
whatever it is you're harping about.

41:43.400 --> 41:46.779
This story is about Ragini.

41:47.037 --> 41:48.710
MMS?
-No, SMS.

41:48.772 --> 41:51.685
SMS?
-Simple, marvelous and sexy.

41:51.876 --> 41:55.619
Ragini's beauty was
the talk of the village.

41:55.679 --> 41:59.126
Men wrote her letters in blood.

41:59.183 --> 42:02.289
But to keep all the sinners
away from her daughten.

42:02.620 --> 42:05.658
...her father stood
at the door of their house.

42:08.225 --> 42:11.798
The posse of men ended
up waving their hands.

42:11.896 --> 42:14.706
But the day of the
union never arrived.

42:14.765 --> 42:17.575
Ragini suppressed
the hunger of her youth.

42:22.506 --> 42:26.010
Poor Ragini,
quietly endured everything..

42:26.076 --> 42:29.546
...because her father
had a long stick in his hand.

42:32.917 --> 42:36.797
Neither did she get a cucumber,
nor did she play..

42:36.887 --> 42:39.060
...hide and seek in the arms of a man.

42:39.390 --> 42:42.394
I agree that it's a flashback,
but is the rhyming required?

42:42.493 --> 42:44.404
This is a style of
narrating the story..

42:44.495 --> 42:46.338
...without which
everything is just bland.

42:46.397 --> 42:48.536
Don't irritate, come to the point!

42:48.632 --> 42:54.639
The guys yearning for Ragini spread
false stories about lions attacking..

42:54.705 --> 42:57.151
...but her father didn't budge.

42:57.241 --> 42:59.949
Then one day, really..
-The lion attacked?

43:00.044 --> 43:02.149
No, a snake attacked.

43:02.212 --> 43:06.058
But taking it to be a lie,
Ragini's father didn't come.

43:18.162 --> 43:19.163
Daughten.

43:22.900 --> 43:24.937
No... no..

43:27.338 --> 43:30.319
This is where the
story should have ended.

43:30.407 --> 43:34.412
But when she died,
Ragini's youth was yet to blossom.

43:34.478 --> 43:37.925
Any man would do for her,
whatever be his faith or creed.

43:38.015 --> 43:44.364
All that Ragini's soul
wants is a wedding night.

43:47.091 --> 43:49.469
Guys, one shouldn't mock
at a dead person like this.

43:49.526 --> 43:51.233
What if the story turns out to be true?
-Shut up.

43:51.328 --> 43:53.433
You coward! Ghost are not real.

43:54.164 --> 43:56.041
Now I know why it was proving
hard to sell your mansion. -Yes.

43:56.133 --> 43:58.306
It's due to these
baseless horror stories.

43:58.402 --> 44:00.143
Come, let's ask
someone for directions.

44:00.204 --> 44:01.615
Get lost, blanket-man!

44:01.705 --> 44:03.878
Where are you going?

44:04.074 --> 44:07.453
Don't go to Ragini's mansion.
Don't go!

44:47.284 --> 44:50.788
Wow, Amar. This is quite big.

45:00.564 --> 45:02.009
It's a cat, you coward!

45:02.800 --> 45:05.644
Hey Meet, switch on the torch.
Let's find the switchboard.

45:14.044 --> 45:16.081
Why aren't the lights turning on?

45:16.180 --> 45:18.387
It's a village,
there must be a power cut.

45:18.449 --> 45:20.190
Don't worry, come.

45:23.987 --> 45:25.364
Even the torch isn't working now.

45:25.456 --> 45:27.026
This torch is torturing us.

45:54.485 --> 45:58.092
You've arrived.
You all have finally arrived.

46:00.758 --> 46:02.533
I've been waiting for long.

46:02.626 --> 46:03.832
For us?

46:04.161 --> 46:05.333
For anyone..

46:05.963 --> 46:09.501
...who'd enter this house.

46:12.469 --> 46:13.948
So many years..

46:16.473 --> 46:19.010
I've been waiting for so many years.

46:19.376 --> 46:21.253
This is my house. Who are you?

46:22.813 --> 46:24.121
I'm Shabri.

46:24.581 --> 46:26.652
Shabri. Tell us, Shabri.

46:26.717 --> 46:29.630
What do I tell you, sir?

46:30.554 --> 46:35.697
An orphan like me makes
any available shelter her home.

46:36.126 --> 46:39.539
My story is a very tragic one, sir.
Very tragic.

46:40.164 --> 46:43.577
If you hear it, your eyes will water.

46:45.202 --> 46:47.580
It's my mouth that is watering.

46:49.907 --> 46:51.477
I lost my mother in childhood..

46:51.575 --> 46:54.078
...and her burden fell on my chest.

46:55.879 --> 46:57.916
In my youth, I lost my father.

46:58.482 --> 47:01.827
Even the burden of his
responsibilities, fell on my chest.

47:03.453 --> 47:05.262
You can't see, sir.

47:05.322 --> 47:09.429
How much burden I carry on my chest!

47:11.361 --> 47:12.431
Yes, we can see.

47:12.629 --> 47:14.973
If you wish, we can even lift it.

47:15.232 --> 47:16.540
Only if you wish.

47:16.600 --> 47:17.578
What?

47:19.770 --> 47:21.841
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

47:23.006 --> 47:24.952
I had just taken refuge
here all these days.

47:25.142 --> 47:27.816
If you permit,
shall I start working here?

47:27.978 --> 47:29.013
Working?

47:29.079 --> 47:32.322
Don't refuse, sir.
I'll do all your work.

47:32.416 --> 47:35.226
I'll fulfill all
your needs and desires.

47:35.385 --> 47:38.264
Not just my age,
even my sleep is tender.

47:38.488 --> 47:41.435
Even if you call at midnight,
I'll come running.

47:41.725 --> 47:43.671
I'll do what you say.

47:43.727 --> 47:45.798
I'll do where you say.

47:45.896 --> 47:48.206
I'll do it the way you say.

47:49.700 --> 47:53.978
Enough, girl. Are you going
to take a promotion on joining day?

47:54.938 --> 47:56.417
Your job's confirmed.

47:56.473 --> 47:57.349
ReaHy?
-Yes.

47:57.941 --> 47:59.978
I'll prepare a meal
for you all right away.

48:00.010 --> 48:02.354
And clean up the whole house.
-Ok.

48:06.149 --> 48:07.753
How could you appoint her like this?

48:07.818 --> 48:09.695
We don't know whether
she's lying or not.

48:09.786 --> 48:12.232
There should be some
reason to believe her.

48:12.289 --> 48:17.295
There is.
Didn't you see the two big reasons?

48:17.361 --> 48:21.935
And if god wants,
I'll show you the third reason soon.

48:21.999 --> 48:24.980
Correct. So what if there's
no Shiney in the village?

48:25.035 --> 48:26.571
We have a Shabri at home.

48:26.637 --> 48:28.344
Yes!
'Yes!

48:28.438 --> 48:30.145
But we are three.

48:32.042 --> 48:33.453
May the best man win!

48:33.510 --> 48:36.855
May the best man win!
-May the best man win!

49:09.046 --> 49:13.051
"Your love possesses me like a ghost."

49:13.116 --> 49:16.962
"My heart is stuck on you,
like a bloody fool."

49:17.054 --> 49:21.002
"It's been waiting
helplessly since long."

49:21.091 --> 49:25.369
"You never meet,
despite all the promises."

49:25.429 --> 49:29.707
"Where are you?
Where are you after prepping me up?"

49:31.535 --> 49:39.078
"With a silk scarf around your neck,
come and meet me.."

49:39.476 --> 49:45.722
"..I stand outside the club,
my eyes lined with kohl from Delhi."

49:47.417 --> 49:49.397
"Silk scarf.."

49:59.830 --> 50:01.832
"Move it.. let me do my thing."

50:03.133 --> 50:05.135
"You're the hottest,
get on the floor."

50:05.235 --> 50:07.237
"My heart is stuffed
with love for you."

50:07.304 --> 50:09.250
"You're good luck
as well as good news."

50:09.306 --> 50:13.118
"Don't misuse me, O miss.
I just want to say."

50:13.176 --> 50:18.353
"O darling, why are you so hyper?
Step on the brakes of your heart."

50:18.415 --> 50:21.225
"I just want to say.."

50:21.651 --> 50:25.895
"Where are you?
Where are you after prepping me up?"

50:27.624 --> 50:35.304
"With a silk scarf around your neck,
come and meet me.."

50:35.665 --> 50:41.946
"..I stand outside the club,
my eyes lined with kohl from Delhi."

50:43.607 --> 50:45.712
"Silk scarf.."

50:55.719 --> 50:57.995
"Move it.. let me do my thing."

50:59.489 --> 51:01.230
"You're the hottest,
get on the floor."

51:01.324 --> 51:05.101
"How long will you keep me yearning,
trapped in your grip?"

51:05.195 --> 51:09.666
"The poor lover is on tenterhooks,
I just want to say."

51:09.733 --> 51:14.512
"O darling, I'm good and you're fine.
I'm yours and you're mine."

51:14.571 --> 51:17.211
"I just want to say."

51:17.741 --> 51:21.951
"Where are you?
Where are you after prepping me up?"

51:23.747 --> 51:31.256
"With a silk scarf around your neck,
come and meet me.."

51:31.688 --> 51:37.934
"..I stand outside the club,
my eyes lined with kohl from Delhi."

51:39.729 --> 51:42.437
"Silk scarf.."

51:42.499 --> 51:44.410
Stop, Amar! Where are you taking her?

51:46.269 --> 51:49.512
Shabri, my patience is running out.

51:50.574 --> 51:53.646
Nab him!
-Wait!

51:55.011 --> 51:56.957
Amar, you coward!
-Amar, you coward!

51:57.013 --> 51:58.492
Open the door.
-Open the door.

51:59.349 --> 52:01.488
Don't worry,
this loser won't take much time.

52:01.551 --> 52:02.996
He's two-minute noodles.

52:03.086 --> 52:04.963
Yes, he's 'quick-gun' Murugan.

52:05.021 --> 52:07.934
Fire.. fire.. misfire!

52:09.426 --> 52:11.770
See, your friends are getting worried.

52:12.963 --> 52:16.137
Meet isn't worried for you,
but his medicines.

52:16.333 --> 52:17.471
Medicines?

52:17.868 --> 52:18.869
What's wrong with him?

52:18.935 --> 52:20.778
He has a problem getting up.

52:21.037 --> 52:23.916
Getting up? But his legs appear fine.

52:23.974 --> 52:28.013
It's not about his legs,
but somewhere else.

52:28.178 --> 52:31.990
Actually,
it's always 6.30 on his watch.

52:32.849 --> 52:34.192
I didn't understand.

52:34.651 --> 52:38.258
His gadget doesn't work.

52:38.355 --> 52:40.028
Oh god, poor guy!

52:40.090 --> 52:45.005
That guy is pooren.
he.. what's his name? -Who?

52:45.061 --> 52:48.167
That fat guy with buck teeth,
who laughs in a weird manner.

52:48.265 --> 52:49.642
That ugly fat thing.

52:49.799 --> 52:51.779
Prem?
-Yes, Prem.

52:52.269 --> 52:55.716
He needs prayers along with his pills.

52:55.772 --> 52:58.013
Why? What happened to him?

52:58.575 --> 53:00.555
He's on his..

53:00.644 --> 53:01.645
What?

53:02.179 --> 53:03.317
...way out.

53:03.580 --> 53:08.359
It's a venereal disease that even
Dr. Gupta couldn't cure.

53:08.418 --> 53:09.692
Venereal disease?

53:09.853 --> 53:12.561
Oh god, he even touched me.

53:12.622 --> 53:16.035
Oh poor girl, this disease
doesn't spread by touching.

53:16.126 --> 53:18.766
Only love spreads by touching.

53:19.763 --> 53:23.575
But if you still want, I'll check you.

53:55.832 --> 53:56.902
What the“

54:16.553 --> 54:18.760
What happened to you?

54:20.957 --> 54:22.527
I'll get some water for you.

54:28.531 --> 54:30.067
Look, what happened to him?

54:30.133 --> 54:32.113
Forget him, are you all right?

54:32.168 --> 54:33.340
I'm fine, look at him.

54:33.436 --> 54:35.848
We'll look at him later, first you.

54:35.905 --> 54:36.747
Come.

54:36.806 --> 54:38.217
Come soon.

54:42.712 --> 54:46.421
You rascal, just five minutes
with Shabri and you're so heated up.

54:46.516 --> 54:48.427
She's a very hot chick, man.

54:48.518 --> 54:51.089
She shook him up so
bad that he's still shaking.

54:51.288 --> 54:52.665
You vibrator!

54:54.858 --> 54:55.859
She's here.

54:55.959 --> 54:57.267
Here, drink some water.

54:57.994 --> 54:59.200
What's the matter? Take the glass.

54:59.696 --> 55:00.970
You take your medicines too.

55:01.031 --> 55:02.009
Medicines?

55:02.265 --> 55:05.803
Shabri, it's Amar who is ill, not me.

55:06.002 --> 55:07.640
No need to hide.

55:08.004 --> 55:10.348
Amar told me everything.

55:10.440 --> 55:13.717
Your clock is always stuck at 6.30.

55:17.213 --> 55:19.591
That's a lie! You liar!

55:20.116 --> 55:21.754
He's lying.

55:22.118 --> 55:23.290
I'm He-man.

55:23.353 --> 55:26.334
Ask Prem if you don't believe me.

55:26.389 --> 55:29.836
Meet, now that Shabri has found out,
why deny it?

55:29.926 --> 55:31.166
Tell her that you're impotent.

55:32.462 --> 55:34.203
Rascal, you turned
out to be a liar too.

55:34.264 --> 55:37.074
You rascals,
have some respect for our friendship.

55:37.133 --> 55:38.976
Meet, shut up.
-Ok.

55:39.269 --> 55:43.115
Shabri, did this guy
say anything about my clock?

55:43.540 --> 55:44.883
No.

55:44.941 --> 55:48.286
I knew that there can't
be a truer friend than him.

55:48.345 --> 55:50.825
But he told me about
your venereal disease.

55:50.914 --> 55:53.451
With a friend like him,
who needs enemies!

55:53.550 --> 55:55.188
I don't have any venereal disease.

55:55.251 --> 55:57.492
And neither is it 6.30 on my clock.

55:58.154 --> 56:02.830
The truth is that the needle
on his clock is very tiny.

56:02.926 --> 56:06.772
Yes. And I've seen him stuff
socks in his underwear many times.

56:06.963 --> 56:08.465
ReaHy?
-Yes.

56:08.665 --> 56:10.269
What?
- Yes.

56:10.600 --> 56:14.047
Actually, I've grown only
vertically since 2nd grade.

56:14.104 --> 56:15.105
Not horizontally.

56:15.872 --> 56:18.352
I agree friends that
it's difficult to believe.

56:18.441 --> 56:22.184
But check the mirror once
and you'll know the truth.

56:22.278 --> 56:23.086
Let go.

56:23.380 --> 56:26.987
Forget the mirror, let me measure.

56:47.437 --> 56:50.577
Thank you, Amar, for opening my eyes.

56:50.673 --> 56:53.620
I agree,
I suffer from a venereal disease.

56:53.710 --> 56:56.953
Not just me, my whole family
suffers from a venereal disease.

56:57.247 --> 57:01.662
Meet, listen to us.
Look at the mirror.

57:01.718 --> 57:04.756
Prem, shut up.
-No kidding.

57:04.921 --> 57:06.400
I look at the mirror everyday.

57:06.489 --> 57:10.631
Shabri, as far as
manliness is concerned..

57:10.827 --> 57:13.398
...the truth is that
there's no greaten.

57:19.135 --> 57:20.773
No greaten.

57:23.206 --> 57:26.983
No greaten. no greaten.

57:27.076 --> 57:28.282
'No greater' what?

57:29.779 --> 57:31.554
No greater wuss than me.

57:31.614 --> 57:35.585
It's always 6.30 on my clock.

57:35.685 --> 57:41.135
Friends, when all our
truths has been exposed..

57:41.191 --> 57:44.604
...then why not go out for a walk?

57:44.661 --> 57:47.904
Shabri, just coming.

57:48.631 --> 57:51.271
Aren't you coming, Meet?
-Coming.

57:51.568 --> 57:54.310
"Silk scarf.."

57:59.876 --> 58:05.724
Neither do you have any problems,
nor am I Shabri.

58:06.115 --> 58:10.063
Because my name is Ragini.

58:12.922 --> 58:14.230
Run!

58:21.097 --> 58:23.475
I've waited for 50 years.

58:23.533 --> 58:25.843
My time has finally come!

58:28.872 --> 58:29.907
Run!

58:46.122 --> 58:48.363
Come, dearie.. let's have fun.

59:01.838 --> 59:04.284
Come, let's have a grand time.

59:08.611 --> 59:11.091
Open up.. open up..

59:27.196 --> 59:30.803
No, let's have great fun and frolic.

59:41.110 --> 59:42.453
Run for your lives!

1:00:13.476 --> 1:00:15.683
Without fulfilling my desires.

1:00:15.878 --> 1:00:19.223
...if any of you tries
to flee from here..

1:00:19.782 --> 1:00:22.160
...then you'll keep
getting such shocks.

1:00:23.386 --> 1:00:25.798
You've come here of your own will..

1:00:25.989 --> 1:00:29.732
...but you'll go when I will.

1:00:30.493 --> 1:00:33.906
The one among the three
of you who has fun with me..

1:00:33.963 --> 1:00:37.342
...will have to die
and go to heaven with me.

1:00:40.637 --> 1:00:46.713
Without which, neither will I find
salvation, nor will you get freedom.

1:00:49.746 --> 1:00:53.057
The cheap oranges have proven costly.

1:00:53.416 --> 1:00:55.896
Now only our ashes
will leave this place.

1:00:55.985 --> 1:01:00.434
Serves us right for wanting
to have great, grand fun!

1:01:25.481 --> 1:01:28.655
This ghost won't let the
three of us leave this place alive.

1:01:29.218 --> 1:01:32.097
One of us will have to sacrifice
himself and sleep with her.

1:01:33.356 --> 1:01:35.336
On one hand, it's my life.

1:01:36.059 --> 1:01:37.834
On the other hand, it's those two.

1:01:38.594 --> 1:01:40.904
My friends, my brothers.

1:01:42.131 --> 1:01:43.906
The decision is very simple.

1:01:44.267 --> 1:01:45.507
Let them die.

1:02:05.555 --> 1:02:07.034
It's working.

1:02:15.098 --> 1:02:17.772
Prem, have this.

1:02:18.501 --> 1:02:21.345
I prepared your favourite yoghurt.

1:02:21.904 --> 1:02:24.111
Who knows if there's a tomorrow!

1:02:24.841 --> 1:02:26.787
Don't say such things, pal.
Don't lose hope.

1:02:26.976 --> 1:02:28.478
We'll surely find a way out.

1:02:28.678 --> 1:02:29.884
What if we don't?

1:02:29.946 --> 1:02:32.290
Then we have sandwiches.
-Sandwich?

1:02:32.548 --> 1:02:34.152
I mean..
-Sit.

1:02:34.484 --> 1:02:36.157
How can we think on an empty stomach?

1:02:36.219 --> 1:02:38.324
Just like how you prepared
our favourite yoghurt.

1:02:38.387 --> 1:02:40.663
I prepared your favourite sandwiches.

1:02:41.758 --> 1:02:43.066
Your sandwich?
-I ate mine.

1:02:43.159 --> 1:02:44.467
Your yoghurt?
-I drank it long back.

1:02:46.195 --> 1:02:47.230
Eat.
-Drink.

1:02:47.663 --> 1:02:51.270
Wow, friends!
Since you both were working so hard..

1:02:51.434 --> 1:02:53.277
...how could I stay behind?

1:02:53.636 --> 1:02:56.048
I prepared your
favourite sweet pudding.

1:02:56.639 --> 1:02:58.448
People eat sweets in celebration“

1:02:58.641 --> 1:03:00.348
...we'll eat it in grief.

1:03:02.111 --> 1:03:03.715
Your bowl?
-I don't eat sweets.

1:03:04.947 --> 1:03:06.153
You both know it.

1:03:07.383 --> 1:03:08.259
Eat it.

1:03:09.085 --> 1:03:10.257
Drink. -Eat.

1:03:10.987 --> 1:03:12.489
Drink. -Eat.

1:03:14.557 --> 1:03:16.503
Nice, eh?

1:03:19.929 --> 1:03:20.999
How is the pudding?

1:03:21.063 --> 1:03:23.065
Liked it?
-Yes.

1:03:23.366 --> 1:03:24.504
Eat it all.

1:03:36.779 --> 1:03:39.453
Wow, Amar! The yoghurt is amazing.

1:03:57.500 --> 1:03:59.537
Rascal, what did
you mix in the yoghurt?

1:04:00.803 --> 1:04:03.613
Viagra.
-What?!

1:04:04.574 --> 1:04:09.148
Sorry, friends, actually I
had to stoop down to make you rise.

1:04:09.245 --> 1:04:11.851
Scoundrel, you're not
the only one who stooped low..

1:04:11.914 --> 1:04:13.689
...and we're not the
only ones who have risen.

1:04:13.749 --> 1:04:14.454
Meaning?

1:04:14.550 --> 1:04:18.225
Meaning, there was viagra in the
sandwich too, not just the yoghurt.

1:04:19.188 --> 1:04:20.531
What?!

1:04:24.026 --> 1:04:25.437
And even the pudding.

1:04:26.295 --> 1:04:27.399
What?!

1:04:33.035 --> 1:04:34.514
Damn!

1:04:40.309 --> 1:04:41.879
Hurry UP-

1:04:42.478 --> 1:04:44.549
Quietly. Not a word.

1:05:10.673 --> 1:05:18.285
"Baby, come to me.
The night is young."

1:05:18.347 --> 1:05:25.094
"Why don't you love me more?
Where do you go?"

1:05:26.822 --> 1:05:30.531
"I'll show you a good time,
take you to heaven."

1:05:30.593 --> 1:05:33.039
"In life, you need to take risks."

1:05:33.129 --> 1:05:40.672
"I want your love..
your love.. your love, O beloved!"

1:05:40.736 --> 1:05:48.985
"I want your love..
your love.. your love, O beloved!"

1:05:52.148 --> 1:05:53.786
"I want your.."

1:05:55.918 --> 1:05:57.556
"I want your.."

1:06:04.694 --> 1:06:08.471
"Don't go away. Come to me, O dear."

1:06:08.564 --> 1:06:12.273
"Only worry,
your body yearns and so does my soul."

1:06:14.270 --> 1:06:16.079
"My soul yearns."

1:06:18.107 --> 1:06:19.882
"My soul yearns."

1:06:19.976 --> 1:06:23.719
"Don't go away. Come to me, O dear."

1:06:23.813 --> 1:06:27.522
"Only worry,
your body yearns and so does my soul."

1:06:27.817 --> 1:06:31.355
"I won't let go today.
I'll revel in the chill."

1:06:31.654 --> 1:06:33.895
"I won't let any of your tricks work."

1:06:33.956 --> 1:06:41.602
"I want your love..
your love.. your love, O beloved!"

1:06:41.664 --> 1:06:49.742
"I want your love..
your love.. your love, O beloved!"

1:07:05.654 --> 1:07:09.363
"I tore up the calendar
that kept a count of your wait."

1:07:09.458 --> 1:07:13.201
"Shower me with your love now,
O darling!"

1:07:15.164 --> 1:07:17.007
"Shower me with your love."

1:07:18.968 --> 1:07:20.845
"Shower me with your love."

1:07:20.903 --> 1:07:24.646
"I tore up the calendar
that kept a count of your wait."

1:07:24.707 --> 1:07:28.450
"Shower me with your love now,
O darling!"

1:07:28.711 --> 1:07:32.557
"Two is better than one,
three is better than two."

1:07:32.648 --> 1:07:34.787
"Come, let's fall in love."

1:07:34.884 --> 1:07:36.795
"I want your.."

1:07:38.754 --> 1:07:46.297
"I want your love..
your love.. your love, O beloved!"

1:07:46.362 --> 1:07:54.440
"I want your love..
your love.. your love, O beloved!"

1:07:56.305 --> 1:07:58.012
Oh damn! We're dead!

1:07:58.074 --> 1:08:00.918
How do we escape the
effects of the viagra?

1:08:01.410 --> 1:08:04.823
Think of something bad. Something
disgusting, distasteful. -Ok.

1:08:04.880 --> 1:08:07.019
Disgusting? Just a minute.

1:08:10.219 --> 1:08:11.289
What?

1:08:11.353 --> 1:08:14.300
You rascal, you're looking at your
mom-in-law's photo in this condition!

1:08:14.356 --> 1:08:15.801
Disgusting.. disgusting!

1:08:15.891 --> 1:08:20.033
Even my breath goes limp in
front of her, the pole is nothing.

1:08:33.609 --> 1:08:34.679
It worked!

1:08:35.644 --> 1:08:36.918
I too have an idea.

1:08:52.161 --> 1:08:53.538
It worked for you too!

1:08:55.598 --> 1:08:57.839
Hey, I also have an idea.

1:09:21.357 --> 1:09:23.359
That was a bad idea.

1:09:25.928 --> 1:09:27.236
Careful, man!

1:10:00.863 --> 1:10:02.103
Wow, buddy!

1:10:02.198 --> 1:10:05.839
I saw a piano being played
with a flute for the first time. -Yes.

1:10:05.901 --> 1:10:09.041
Hariprasad Chaurasia meets Beethoven.

1:10:09.705 --> 1:10:11.013
Do you know any other songs?

1:10:43.272 --> 1:10:45.752
Prem, is everything fine?

1:10:46.175 --> 1:10:49.281
You're upset as if
you broke something.

1:10:49.478 --> 1:10:51.151
Here, bandage it.

1:10:51.981 --> 1:10:54.723
Bandage? It's totally bent out here!

1:11:03.425 --> 1:11:06.429
I'm following you around like crazy..

1:11:06.595 --> 1:11:08.734
...and you guys are hiding from me!

1:11:09.698 --> 1:11:12.110
Ragini, I was ready for fun.

1:11:12.201 --> 1:11:15.273
But what to do, I'm slightly injured.

1:11:16.372 --> 1:11:17.874
My stomach is upset.

1:11:17.940 --> 1:11:19.715
My mind is upset.

1:11:19.875 --> 1:11:21.115
I mean, a headache.

1:11:21.176 --> 1:11:23.122
Stop making excuses.

1:11:23.345 --> 1:11:25.985
You don't know about my powers.

1:11:29.885 --> 1:11:34.231
Had I wanted, I could have
made you do anything. Anything.

1:11:35.791 --> 1:11:39.034
But it's not fun if it's forced.

1:11:40.195 --> 1:11:43.699
Moreover,
you'll have to fulfill my wish.

1:11:43.999 --> 1:11:45.034
Or else..

1:11:45.501 --> 1:11:46.741
I'm ready.

1:11:47.336 --> 1:11:48.314
ReaHy?

1:11:49.338 --> 1:11:50.908
Have you gone mad, Prem?

1:11:50.973 --> 1:11:52.680
If you do something with her..

1:11:52.741 --> 1:11:54.379
Life isn't great anyway.

1:11:55.010 --> 1:11:58.355
There can't be a more beautiful
way to commit suicide.

1:11:58.414 --> 1:11:59.620
I'm ready, ma'am.

1:11:59.815 --> 1:12:01.192
Are you sure?
-Yes.

1:12:01.283 --> 1:12:04.730
Tonight at 9 pm,
wait for me in your room.

1:12:06.255 --> 1:12:07.165
Just a minute.

1:12:07.823 --> 1:12:11.794
Hold your tongue until then
and give me time for recovery.

1:12:11.894 --> 1:12:13.430
Really? I understood.

1:12:13.595 --> 1:12:15.506
We'll meet directly at night.

1:12:19.368 --> 1:12:22.440
Prem, my friend.. my brothen.

1:12:22.504 --> 1:12:24.745
We'll miss you after
returning to Mumbai, buddy.

1:12:24.840 --> 1:12:26.649
Meet, let's pack our bags.
-Yes.

1:12:26.709 --> 1:12:29.246
Just a minute,
let's take a photo of his. -Why?

1:12:29.511 --> 1:12:32.492
We'll need it for Prem's photoframe.
-Shut up.

1:12:32.881 --> 1:12:35.191
I'm not going to do
anything with her. -What?

1:12:35.417 --> 1:12:36.191
Then why did you commit to her?

1:12:36.285 --> 1:12:38.788
What was the need to take
a stray arrow on your butt?

1:12:38.887 --> 1:12:40.127
Shut up.

1:12:41.357 --> 1:12:48.206
Friends, I have an idea.
-Oh no!

1:12:55.070 --> 1:12:56.981
Babu Rangeela.

1:13:01.276 --> 1:13:03.222
Very loose in character.

1:13:07.850 --> 1:13:09.488
The gigolo of the village.

1:13:15.557 --> 1:13:17.628
Male prostitute.

1:13:17.726 --> 1:13:18.761
Male prostitute?

1:13:18.827 --> 1:13:21.706
Yes. Even if there has to
be a sacrifice, it need not be us.

1:13:22.698 --> 1:13:25.577
He charges 5000 for each visit.

1:13:25.768 --> 1:13:27.907
I offered him 50,000.

1:13:28.003 --> 1:13:29.107
50,000?

1:13:29.338 --> 1:13:30.544
We don't have to pay him anyway.

1:13:30.639 --> 1:13:32.915
Once he does it, he's gone.

1:13:33.709 --> 1:13:35.552
Prem, you're a genius.

1:13:35.644 --> 1:13:36.520
Hi, guys!

1:13:37.946 --> 1:13:42.588
Myself, Babu Rangeela.

1:13:45.988 --> 1:13:48.229
This guy? Can he do it?

1:13:48.323 --> 1:13:51.998
Hey! Don't underestimate
Babu Rangeela.

1:13:52.261 --> 1:13:54.400
My clientele is spread far and wide.

1:13:55.197 --> 1:13:56.733
Look at this item.

1:14:02.404 --> 1:14:04.111
Deepika?

1:14:07.342 --> 1:14:08.480
Katrina!

1:14:12.648 --> 1:14:13.956
Sunny Leone.

1:14:18.353 --> 1:14:19.798
Sunny Deal?!

1:14:23.425 --> 1:14:25.701
Actually,
I showed you the wrong album.

1:14:26.495 --> 1:14:28.771
I'm a fan of these people.

1:14:28.831 --> 1:14:31.835
I'll show you the client album.
-It's 0k, let it be.

1:14:31.900 --> 1:14:34.676
Look, there's no dearth of money.

1:14:34.736 --> 1:14:37.546
But come what may,
don't change your mind.

1:14:40.309 --> 1:14:46.021
Once I commit,
he doesn't listen to me either.

1:14:46.815 --> 1:14:48.852
Wow, that's great!

1:14:49.117 --> 1:14:52.223
Sir, please wait inside.
She'll be there in a moment.

1:14:52.888 --> 1:14:55.095
Hurry up, I don't have time.

1:14:58.160 --> 1:15:00.504
This fish took the bait.
Come, let's pack our bags. -Yes.

1:15:00.596 --> 1:15:04.009
Surprise!
-Hi, baby!

1:15:07.903 --> 1:15:11.578
Just when we got rid of one witch,
three more have arrived!

1:15:12.307 --> 1:15:14.913
Darling..
-Darling..

1:15:15.878 --> 1:15:17.414
What a pleasant surprise!

1:15:17.479 --> 1:15:19.288
How come you're here?

1:15:19.348 --> 1:15:21.487
You must be tired. Sit down.

1:15:21.783 --> 1:15:22.989
Come, sit.

1:15:23.852 --> 1:15:26.492
Did you three think
why we've come here?

1:15:26.722 --> 1:15:28.224
Why have you come here?

1:15:28.323 --> 1:15:29.927
It's 'Karva Chauth'
(festival) tomorrow.

1:15:29.992 --> 1:15:33.235
So we wanted to surprise
the three of you.

1:15:33.629 --> 1:15:36.075
Karva Chauth. How sweet!

1:15:36.164 --> 1:15:39.441
We can't stay away
from you on such days.

1:15:40.402 --> 1:15:43.645
Hello! How much longer
will you make me wait?

1:15:46.408 --> 1:15:47.352
Who is he?

1:15:47.442 --> 1:15:49.649
Who is he?
-Who is he? Tell them.

1:15:49.711 --> 1:15:52.123
He's come to buy the mansion.

1:15:52.180 --> 1:15:54.717
Oh, he's come to buy the mansion.

1:15:54.783 --> 1:15:56.820
These three can't be relied upon.

1:15:57.119 --> 1:16:00.032
If this mansion has to be sold,
then we only have to do something.

1:16:00.088 --> 1:16:01.260
Come.

1:16:01.790 --> 1:16:03.167
Listen to me.

1:16:04.126 --> 1:16:04.934
Hello.
-Hello.

1:16:04.993 --> 1:16:05.733
Are you an agent?

1:16:05.794 --> 1:16:09.435
Hey! I'm not an agent,
you can say 'customer' instead.

1:16:09.531 --> 1:16:13.172
Oh.. Ok, look,
the structure is in front of you.

1:16:13.235 --> 1:16:14.839
Tell me, how do you like it?

1:16:22.144 --> 1:16:23.418
I loved it.

1:16:23.478 --> 1:16:25.082
I'm ready, come.

1:16:25.147 --> 1:16:26.888
Really? Then shall
we discuss the money?

1:16:26.949 --> 1:16:28.292
They've already discussed that.

1:16:28.350 --> 1:16:30.261
The deal has been finalised at Rs.
50,000. Come.

1:16:30.485 --> 1:16:32.931
50,000? Have you lost your mind?

1:16:32.988 --> 1:16:36.094
It should atleast be 50 million.

1:16:36.158 --> 1:16:37.102
50 million?!

1:16:37.159 --> 1:16:38.695
Look at his face.

1:16:38.760 --> 1:16:41.240
Even 60 million is not much for him.
- Absolutely.

1:16:41.296 --> 1:16:44.834
60 millions!

1:16:46.668 --> 1:16:50.047
60 millions! Nobody in my
family has ever earned that much.

1:16:54.009 --> 1:16:56.580
Sir, are you fine?

1:16:56.678 --> 1:16:59.284
Sir..
-60 million!

1:16:59.848 --> 1:17:01.020
What has happened to him?

1:17:01.083 --> 1:17:03.495
Didn't you hear? His whole
family hasn't earned that much.

1:17:03.552 --> 1:17:05.896
These beggars just drop
by to check out the house.

1:17:05.954 --> 1:17:07.900
Baby, let him be.
Why don't you go and freshen up?

1:17:07.956 --> 1:17:09.765
Yes, we'll take care of him.

1:17:09.858 --> 1:17:10.928
Ok? Go on.

1:17:10.993 --> 1:17:13.337
He wasted so much of our time.
Let's go.

1:17:13.695 --> 1:17:15.174
Yes, go.

1:17:16.264 --> 1:17:17.572
What about him?

1:17:56.705 --> 1:17:57.809
Betrayal!

1:17:59.374 --> 1:18:00.910
You betrayed me!

1:18:01.209 --> 1:18:05.521
You promised to have fun with me
and called your wives over instead.

1:18:05.681 --> 1:18:07.888
No, we didn't call them.

1:18:07.949 --> 1:18:10.293
He.. he brought them here.
-Yes.

1:18:10.352 --> 1:18:11.456
He's the bone in the throat.

1:18:11.520 --> 1:18:13.500
He brought them here
so that we couldn't have fun.

1:18:13.555 --> 1:18:17.765
You don't worry, I'll punish him
when he regains his senses.

1:18:18.260 --> 1:18:22.072
You don't have to do
all that with me around.

1:18:29.504 --> 1:18:32.246
Do you guys really
want to have fun with me?

1:18:33.909 --> 1:18:35.718
Are you saying this out of fear?

1:18:35.811 --> 1:18:38.917
No, true lust knows no fear!

1:18:39.014 --> 1:18:40.721
Really? Then come.

1:18:46.521 --> 1:18:47.226
No?

1:18:47.322 --> 1:18:51.429
No, I mean.. won't it be
awkward with the wives around?

1:18:51.526 --> 1:18:56.600
If we three can't have fun,
then how can you have fun?

1:18:56.665 --> 1:18:58.667
Once they leave, we'll do as you wish.

1:18:58.767 --> 1:19:00.804
Until then,
you'll have to wait a little.

1:19:03.739 --> 1:19:05.343
Don't worry.

1:19:06.007 --> 1:19:08.248
I won't have to wait for long.

1:19:11.613 --> 1:19:13.615
Friends, let's do one thing.

1:19:13.682 --> 1:19:16.629
Let's tell our wives that
there's a ghost here. -Yes.

1:19:16.685 --> 1:19:20.394
Yes.. and also tell them..

1:19:20.489 --> 1:19:22.765
...that we wanted to have
a good time with that ghost.

1:19:22.858 --> 1:19:26.465
Now that ghost wants to have
a great and grand time with us.

1:19:26.528 --> 1:19:29.998
Oh god, I'm tired of this problem.

1:19:30.065 --> 1:19:33.137
Tired?
-Yes, don't trouble me.

1:19:42.010 --> 1:19:46.049
Here, the three of us have prepared
a tasty meal for the two of you.

1:19:48.016 --> 1:19:49.256
Eat it.

1:19:50.085 --> 1:19:51.826
Yes, we will.

1:19:56.858 --> 1:19:59.498
What are you staring at? Dig in!

1:20:00.328 --> 1:20:04.868
Oh.. now even they're
asking you to dig in.

1:20:06.434 --> 1:20:12.476
Don't worry, darlings.
Neither can they see me, nor hear me.

1:20:13.575 --> 1:20:15.816
How can you all resist it?

1:20:15.877 --> 1:20:17.550
It looks so tempting.

1:20:18.747 --> 1:20:22.160
These guys aren't going to
eat vegetarian when there's chicken.

1:20:23.385 --> 1:20:24.864
Where did you get this chicken from?

1:20:24.920 --> 1:20:28.527
It was loitering in the balcony,
we caught and slaughtered it.

1:20:29.491 --> 1:20:30.526
Babu!

1:20:31.726 --> 1:20:35.139
Rangeela. The rascal deserved it.

1:20:36.064 --> 1:20:38.601
Look, eat what you want.

1:20:39.067 --> 1:20:41.980
But the breast piece
is for my husband.

1:20:42.604 --> 1:20:43.810
It's his favourite.

1:20:44.439 --> 1:20:45.611
Is it?
-Oh!

1:20:45.941 --> 1:20:47.318
Favourite?

1:20:47.909 --> 1:20:51.948
Darling,
why didn't you tell me earlier?

1:21:03.925 --> 1:21:06.531
Don't eat if you don't want to,
atleast don't make faces.

1:21:09.264 --> 1:21:10.402
Ok, forget it.

1:21:10.632 --> 1:21:13.135
Meet loves the leg piece.

1:21:13.201 --> 1:21:15.772
Come what may, he never skips it.

1:21:17.772 --> 1:21:18.978
Don't leave it today either.

1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:28.453
Stop. Stop. Please stop.

1:21:28.516 --> 1:21:35.263
Don't stop. Don't stop.

1:21:35.323 --> 1:21:37.030
Nobody is forcing you.

1:21:37.759 --> 1:21:39.568
You too can leave it if you want.

1:21:39.628 --> 1:21:40.663
Leave it.

1:21:41.363 --> 1:21:42.341
Please.

1:21:42.430 --> 1:21:45.570
Ok, no problem.
Amar will eat the chicken.

1:21:45.634 --> 1:21:47.580
No, I don't want to each chicken.
-Why?

1:21:47.769 --> 1:21:49.612
It's Saturday today.

1:21:49.671 --> 1:21:52.242
Yes.
-I'll eat the noodles.

1:22:16.731 --> 1:22:18.608
Oh, chew with your mouth closed.

1:22:22.137 --> 1:22:23.639
What's wrong with the three of you?

1:22:23.905 --> 1:22:27.045
We prepared the meal so lovingly
and you three are misbehaving.

1:22:27.609 --> 1:22:30.317
Damn disgusting! Let's go from here.

1:22:30.412 --> 1:22:31.720
Yes, let's go.

1:22:31.813 --> 1:22:33.850
Rekha..
-Nisha.. Listen to me, Nisha.

1:22:33.915 --> 1:22:35.360
Actually..
-I don't want to hear anything.

1:22:35.450 --> 1:22:36.929
Shut up!
-Listen to me.

1:22:36.985 --> 1:22:38.328
Nisha..

1:22:39.154 --> 1:22:40.997
First you insulted our food.

1:22:41.089 --> 1:22:43.000
Who knows what else you'll do now!

1:22:48.630 --> 1:22:52.840
Nisha, you beauty,
I can't resist your booty.

1:22:55.904 --> 1:22:58.248
Sorry, I didn't..

1:23:00.075 --> 1:23:02.783
Rascal, how dare you
molest your friend's wife!

1:23:04.079 --> 1:23:07.253
I can't even think like
this about my friend's wife.

1:23:09.584 --> 1:23:11.461
Rekha, time for some fun.

1:23:14.422 --> 1:23:18.928
You! He's outraging my modesty
and you're doing nothing about it.

1:23:19.527 --> 1:23:24.033
Hey! You rascal, how dare
you molest your friend's wife!

1:23:24.599 --> 1:23:27.045
Darling.. Hey dearie..

1:23:31.206 --> 1:23:34.483
I told you to save my modesty,
not outrage her.

1:23:34.576 --> 1:23:37.750
Sapna, why cover up?
Get a taste of Meet too.

1:23:41.916 --> 1:23:44.795
You rascal, I couldn't
imagine that you'd stoop so low.

1:23:47.155 --> 1:23:48.395
Get lost!

1:23:48.790 --> 1:23:50.736
Sorry, baby.

1:23:50.892 --> 1:23:52.838
Even I couldn't imagine
that you all would stoop so low.

1:23:52.927 --> 1:23:55.134
We're not going to
stay here a moment longer.

1:23:55.930 --> 1:23:58.410
Get out! C'mon, let's go from here.

1:23:59.968 --> 1:24:02.539
Baby.. listen to me..
there's some misunderstanding“

1:24:02.604 --> 1:24:03.844
Listen to me, Rekha!

1:24:03.938 --> 1:24:04.780
Nisha!
-Rekha!

1:24:04.873 --> 1:24:05.874
Sapna!

1:24:06.274 --> 1:24:08.777
Please believe us, dear.
We don't know how this is happening.

1:24:08.843 --> 1:24:10.481
We always wanted to..

1:24:11.079 --> 1:24:12.683
...outrage your modesty!

1:24:16.818 --> 1:24:18.889
Baby, don't go.

1:24:18.953 --> 1:24:20.523
If you stop, I'll hack off your legs.

1:24:21.956 --> 1:24:22.934
0h god!

1:24:23.258 --> 1:24:24.259
Listen to me, dear.

1:24:24.692 --> 1:24:27.502
Or I'll stick a broom on your butt.

1:24:27.562 --> 1:24:29.166
You'll dance like a peacock
for the rest of your life.

1:24:30.799 --> 1:24:33.973
Hey Raju, get the broom!
Get the broom!

1:24:34.035 --> 1:24:34.843
Broom?

1:24:34.936 --> 1:24:37.712
These guys have gone mad.
Let's run from here, c'mon.

1:24:38.807 --> 1:24:40.047
Baby.. wait..

1:24:40.108 --> 1:24:42.452
"Silk scarf.."

1:24:43.478 --> 1:24:45.480
Ragini, were you doing all this?

1:24:45.547 --> 1:24:50.394
I told you,
you wouldn't have to wait for long.

1:24:51.553 --> 1:24:53.123
Baby! Wait up!

1:24:53.655 --> 1:24:56.966
Darling..
careful, the gates are electrified.

1:25:01.696 --> 1:25:02.572
No?
'No!

1:25:02.664 --> 1:25:04.507
Run!

1:25:04.566 --> 1:25:07.103
The gates aren't electrified.

1:25:33.361 --> 1:25:37.070
What type of current
is this that hits only us?

1:25:56.084 --> 1:25:57.927
Is this is a house or a circus?!

1:25:59.721 --> 1:26:01.894
What have you been upto,
you good-for-nothing!

1:26:01.990 --> 1:26:03.298
It's a circus, mom.

1:26:03.358 --> 1:26:06.430
They were misbehaving
with us while we were here.

1:26:06.694 --> 1:26:10.335
After we left,
they got busy with each other.

1:26:11.166 --> 1:26:12.577
What are you doing?
Why are you holding my hand?

1:26:12.634 --> 1:26:14.113
All of you?
-Here?

1:26:14.169 --> 1:26:15.113
Very bad, Prem.

1:26:15.170 --> 1:26:17.616
All of us came to give you a surprise.

1:26:17.672 --> 1:26:20.619
I thought that all of us
would holiday together as a family.

1:26:20.675 --> 1:26:22.746
Yes, then we met sister on the way.

1:26:22.810 --> 1:26:25.222
She told us about your antics.

1:26:25.280 --> 1:26:27.783
Now you've seen
everything for yourself.

1:26:28.483 --> 1:26:30.429
There's no need for
us to stay here now.

1:26:30.485 --> 1:26:31.862
Come.
-Wait.

1:26:32.887 --> 1:26:34.560
Nobody is going anywhere.

1:26:35.089 --> 1:26:36.500
It's quite late.

1:26:36.891 --> 1:26:38.268
We're all staying here.

1:26:38.326 --> 1:26:40.033
But mom..
-Don't worry.

1:26:40.328 --> 1:26:41.830
I'll keep an eye on them.

1:26:41.996 --> 1:26:43.873
All the men will sleep in one room.

1:26:43.965 --> 1:26:45.808
All the women will sleep in another.

1:26:46.768 --> 1:26:50.477
If any of you misbehaves..

1:26:50.738 --> 1:26:53.810
...I'll break your legs!

1:26:54.876 --> 1:26:55.854
C'mon!

1:27:03.818 --> 1:27:05.593
What bad luck!

1:27:05.653 --> 1:27:07.030
First, it was just our wives.

1:27:07.088 --> 1:27:09.034
Now, even the relatives are here.
-Yes.

1:27:09.457 --> 1:27:12.301
Who knows when we'll come together.

1:27:12.360 --> 1:27:16.467
Shut up!
You three have fooled me enough.

1:27:17.999 --> 1:27:19.637
To hell with the fun!

1:27:21.002 --> 1:27:23.312
Now it's going to be forced.

1:27:25.106 --> 1:27:29.179
Prem, come here.

1:27:29.978 --> 1:27:33.425
What if I possess your sister-in-law?

1:27:35.617 --> 1:27:37.221
Prem..

1:27:37.285 --> 1:27:44.203
...what if sister sees
us getting hanky-panky?

1:27:44.292 --> 1:27:47.330
No.. no.. no hanky-panky!

1:27:52.400 --> 1:27:53.743
Amar, come here.

1:27:54.869 --> 1:27:58.282
What if I possess your mom-in-law?

1:28:02.644 --> 1:28:09.619
I'll relive my youth on this pretext,
darling. -No.

1:28:13.488 --> 1:28:18.233
Meet, what if I possess
your brother-in-law?

1:28:20.328 --> 1:28:21.363
Lakshman!

1:28:23.998 --> 1:28:29.448
Then it'll rip you apart.

1:28:30.872 --> 1:28:32.215
No!
-Yes.

1:28:32.307 --> 1:28:33.615
N9, no!

1:28:41.582 --> 1:28:44.426
Oh man, what is this!

1:28:55.630 --> 1:28:58.941
You got scared!

1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:00.809
Not just scared, I freaked out.

1:29:00.902 --> 1:29:02.973
Not just him, all of us freaked out.

1:29:03.304 --> 1:29:04.180
What is it?

1:29:04.238 --> 1:29:06.912
Your friend's brother-in-law's photos.

1:29:06.974 --> 1:29:10.421
If he pins down a man,
he wears him out.

1:29:10.478 --> 1:29:12.549
Look at how he grips from the front!

1:29:12.613 --> 1:29:14.251
Grips what?
-See this.

1:29:17.218 --> 1:29:20.427
His bear hug is beyond comparison.

1:29:22.490 --> 1:29:23.696
That's bad.

1:29:23.758 --> 1:29:27.467
If he locks them in his thighs, even
the strongest would fall. See this.

1:29:30.164 --> 1:29:31.609
RiP 'IOU apart!

1:29:31.699 --> 1:29:32.609
Meet!

1:29:33.935 --> 1:29:36.313
It's time to go to sleep.

1:29:37.472 --> 1:29:40.385
We'll hug tightly and sleep.
It'll be great fun.

1:29:40.441 --> 1:29:43.251
I need to pee.
-I'll join you.

1:29:43.311 --> 1:29:45.257
We'll do it together.
-Get lost!

1:29:45.880 --> 1:29:46.722
Meet!

1:29:46.814 --> 1:29:49.818
Ragini.. where are you?

1:29:49.884 --> 1:29:52.364
You've won, I've lost. Ragini!

1:29:52.453 --> 1:29:55.332
"Silk scarf.."

1:29:56.424 --> 1:30:01.965
"..tied around the neck.."

1:30:02.029 --> 1:30:05.169
Oh shit! Ragini is
inside Amar's mom-in-law.

1:30:05.233 --> 1:30:07.235
No, I won't be able to do it.

1:30:10.638 --> 1:30:13.881
Meet, climb up the gallow
or Lakshman will climb on you.

1:30:17.945 --> 1:30:19.390
What are you doing here?

1:30:19.447 --> 1:30:20.551
I'm ready to do it.

1:30:20.615 --> 1:30:21.650
What?

1:30:21.816 --> 1:30:23.557
That which you always wanted.

1:30:23.718 --> 1:30:26.460
What are you doing?!
You're stripping in front of me!

1:30:26.521 --> 1:30:29.798
You're getting naked!
What are you doing?!

1:30:29.891 --> 1:30:31.893
I'm getting ready to make love.

1:30:32.093 --> 1:30:34.039
Look, I don't have much time.
Take your clothes off quickly.

1:30:34.128 --> 1:30:34.970
What?!
-Yes.

1:30:35.029 --> 1:30:36.531
Come here, don't irritate.
-Hey“

1:30:36.597 --> 1:30:38.406
Hey.. save me!
-Don't confuse me.

1:30:38.466 --> 1:30:40.446
Don't waste time.
-Save me!

1:30:40.501 --> 1:30:41.411
Meet!

1:30:42.370 --> 1:30:46.443
Good that you came,
see what this fool is doing to me.

1:30:46.674 --> 1:30:48.312
There's no need to say anything.
-Ok.

1:30:48.409 --> 1:30:50.685
His fallen pants reveal everything.

1:30:50.845 --> 1:30:53.849
Wow, Meet!
After seeing your actions today..

1:30:54.115 --> 1:30:56.823
...my respect for you has increased.

1:30:57.351 --> 1:30:58.728
Respect has increased?

1:30:59.220 --> 1:31:02.895
Meet, this was my idea,
so I'll implement it.

1:31:03.691 --> 1:31:04.692
No, Prem..

1:31:04.759 --> 1:31:06.761
...don't take off your clothes.
-What's wrong with both of you!

1:31:06.861 --> 1:31:09.307
I'm there. I've taken off my clothes.
-What do you mean?

1:31:09.363 --> 1:31:11.240
I'm doing it, Prem.
What are you doing?

1:31:11.399 --> 1:31:13.504
C'mon, take me.
-What?

1:31:13.568 --> 1:31:17.106
No, Prem. You have a wife,
a sister-in-law, take care of them.

1:31:17.205 --> 1:31:18.275
I'll take care of her.

1:31:18.339 --> 1:31:20.546
No, Meet. I'll take care of her.

1:31:20.641 --> 1:31:22.985
No, Prem, I'll do it.
-No, Meet, I'll do it.

1:31:23.077 --> 1:31:24.283
No, Prem..

1:31:24.345 --> 1:31:27.224
No, Meet..
-God, save me from these horny men!

1:31:27.315 --> 1:31:28.316
Shut up.

1:31:28.382 --> 1:31:30.794
Now when we both are ready,
you're acting pricey.

1:31:31.018 --> 1:31:32.929
Now you tell me, whom do you want?

1:31:32.987 --> 1:31:35.194
Amar! Amar!

1:31:35.256 --> 1:31:37.532
Oh, so she wants Amar.
-Amar?

1:31:37.725 --> 1:31:39.466
Amar!
-Amar!

1:31:39.560 --> 1:31:41.506
Amar!
-Amar!

1:31:41.596 --> 1:31:44.236
Amar!
-Amar!

1:31:45.900 --> 1:31:47.038
I'm here.

1:31:47.101 --> 1:31:51.675
Amar, see what your rogue
friends are doing with me.

1:31:51.739 --> 1:31:53.082
I've understood everything.

1:31:53.941 --> 1:31:56.945
I could never imagine that
you both would think like this.

1:31:57.211 --> 1:31:59.350
I'm don't regret that
you thought like this..

1:31:59.614 --> 1:32:03.585
...but I regret not thinking
about it before you.

1:32:06.654 --> 1:32:10.124
Hey oldie!
Stop shouting and get in the bed.

1:32:10.191 --> 1:32:11.898
Have you lost it!

1:32:11.959 --> 1:32:14.633
Now one more crazy
guy to join these two!

1:32:14.695 --> 1:32:16.197
Somebody help me!

1:32:16.297 --> 1:32:19.107
Go, Amar! Go, Amar!

1:32:22.270 --> 1:32:25.410
Hey! He's gone mad.
-No, Amar! No, Amar! -Leave me.

1:32:25.473 --> 1:32:27.714
Forget that, look there.

1:32:32.780 --> 1:32:36.956
Sapna, see what these
three are trying to do with me.

1:32:37.485 --> 1:32:39.624
We set out to be the hunter.

1:32:39.720 --> 1:32:42.428
Instead we're going to be hunted now.

1:32:42.523 --> 1:32:44.366
Mom, did they do
such a thing with you?

1:32:44.425 --> 1:32:47.804
Yes. Now even the elders
aren't safe in this house.

1:32:48.296 --> 1:32:51.277
Lust has driven them mad.

1:32:52.099 --> 1:32:55.444
Only one person can save us
from this trouble now.

1:33:03.144 --> 1:33:08.184
I've lost it! I've lost it!

1:33:08.282 --> 1:33:11.388
I've lost it!
-Good that you've come, master.

1:33:11.485 --> 1:33:13.328
It's good that you've come.

1:33:13.387 --> 1:33:15.492
What happened?
You've been lying around these days.

1:33:15.556 --> 1:33:18.036
You know what happened with me?

1:33:20.695 --> 1:33:22.766
Mama's darling boy went astray.

1:33:22.830 --> 1:33:26.710
Not just went astray,
he even pounced on mom-in-law.

1:33:27.368 --> 1:33:31.339
Bad thing! Very, very.. bad thing.

1:33:31.706 --> 1:33:33.845
Sire, please do something.

1:33:33.908 --> 1:33:36.752
Yes, sire. You're the only hope now.

1:33:36.844 --> 1:33:39.984
Sire, what will you do?
Please tell me.

1:33:40.081 --> 1:33:44.188
We'll perform a fire sacrifice.

1:33:44.986 --> 1:33:48.331
The answer to those three
horny men is in my bag.

1:33:48.556 --> 1:33:53.027
Tonight, I'll summon all the spirits
and perform such a sacrifice..

1:33:53.127 --> 1:33:55.038
...that their lust will..

1:33:55.096 --> 1:34:02.378
Out.. out“ run out!

1:34:02.737 --> 1:34:06.446
Sire, will they roam around
freely like this till then?

1:34:06.741 --> 1:34:09.347
I have a solution for that,
Saira Banu.

1:34:09.443 --> 1:34:12.754
Worry.. why worry?

1:34:16.017 --> 1:34:20.488
You and me are locked in
a room and the keys are lost.

1:34:20.921 --> 1:34:22.992
Sire, the keys.

1:34:23.357 --> 1:34:24.301
Open, dear.

1:34:25.493 --> 1:34:26.403
Safe deposit.

1:34:27.662 --> 1:34:31.838
Now you'll get the
keys only after the ritual.

1:34:31.899 --> 1:34:32.673
C'mon now.

1:34:32.733 --> 1:34:34.212
Praise be to the singing master!

1:34:34.268 --> 1:34:36.407
Sire..
-Mom..

1:34:36.470 --> 1:34:39.713
Mom, don't do this.

1:34:42.076 --> 1:34:44.386
It's my birthday today.

1:34:44.712 --> 1:34:46.885
And you're all standing
here with such gloomy faces.

1:34:47.114 --> 1:34:49.754
We should definitely
have some song and dance.

1:34:51.519 --> 1:34:52.998
Ok, I'll sing.

1:34:53.087 --> 1:34:56.660
"I made an entry and bells
began to ring in the heart."

1:35:00.161 --> 1:35:03.802
"Listen to the commentary
of the heart and love is guaranteed."

1:35:11.038 --> 1:35:13.644
Mom, where is the sound
of bells coming from?

1:35:13.708 --> 1:35:15.949
It's the master's grace, my dear.

1:35:16.210 --> 1:35:19.054
The master's arrival has
transformed the house into a temple.

1:35:19.213 --> 1:35:22.490
It's either the bells ringing
or the offerings being made.

1:35:22.817 --> 1:35:25.297
Praise be to the Singing Monk!

1:35:28.823 --> 1:35:30.166
Had fun?

1:35:32.159 --> 1:35:34.867
We'll keep the rest of
the fun for our time together.

1:35:36.097 --> 1:35:38.407
You've made me wait a lot.

1:35:38.699 --> 1:35:41.339
You'll have to pay
the price for the delay.

1:35:41.969 --> 1:35:44.848
Now I don't want one of you,
but all three.

1:35:44.905 --> 1:35:46.680
All three?
-Yes.

1:35:47.074 --> 1:35:50.351
By the way,
you have time till tonight.

1:35:50.778 --> 1:35:53.190
Go and meet your wives.

1:35:53.581 --> 1:35:55.822
Tell her whatever you want.

1:35:56.283 --> 1:35:59.594
I'll wait for my gift at night.

1:36:00.955 --> 1:36:03.959
It's my birthday and
the day you three die.

1:36:04.291 --> 1:36:05.964
We'll celebrate all three togethen.

1:36:09.930 --> 1:36:10.840
...tonight.

1:36:16.504 --> 1:36:19.075
Here's your salad.

1:36:19.173 --> 1:36:21.312
Go on, you also join us.

1:36:22.276 --> 1:36:24.688
Why aren't you three eating?

1:36:25.513 --> 1:36:27.356
Well, mom..

1:36:27.448 --> 1:36:29.359
No, don't tell me..

1:36:29.683 --> 1:36:32.857
...that you have observed
a fast for them.

1:36:32.920 --> 1:36:34.593
They aren't worth it.

1:36:34.755 --> 1:36:36.632
Eat your food. Eat it.

1:36:36.724 --> 1:36:38.795
You're absolutely right, mom.

1:36:38.893 --> 1:36:43.603
By misbehaving with you,
they've crossed all limits.

1:36:43.764 --> 1:36:46.711
I hate them.

1:36:49.870 --> 1:36:52.612
Marrying them was the
biggest mistake of our lives.

1:36:52.840 --> 1:36:54.751
They destroyed our lives.

1:36:57.611 --> 1:37:02.253
To observe a fast for such a disgusting
man is an insult to the custom.

1:37:10.791 --> 1:37:13.533
They used to swear by
our love once upon a time.

1:37:13.594 --> 1:37:15.870
And today,
they're eating on Karva Chauth day.

1:37:15.963 --> 1:37:17.806
It's good that Ragini is killing us.

1:37:17.865 --> 1:37:19.003
We'll be rid of them.

1:37:19.066 --> 1:37:22.206
They're a blemish on
the reputation of wives.

1:37:22.436 --> 1:37:24.473
Death is better than
living with such wives.

1:38:13.387 --> 1:38:18.860
We've decided who amongst the three of
us will get into bed with you first.

1:38:19.960 --> 1:38:22.463
Really? Who?

1:38:24.131 --> 1:38:24.939
Nobody.

1:38:25.032 --> 1:38:26.010
What?!

1:38:26.934 --> 1:38:29.175
Don't you know the
consequences of refusing me?

1:38:29.536 --> 1:38:31.072
Don't yuu!

1:38:33.674 --> 1:38:36.951
Shall I tell you something?
I'm very cowardly.

1:38:37.544 --> 1:38:39.319
The smallest of things freak me out.

1:38:40.047 --> 1:38:43.256
But today, despite you standing
there and saying all this..

1:38:44.251 --> 1:38:45.821
...I'm not scared.

1:38:47.354 --> 1:38:51.393
Because we know that our
wives are observing a fast for us.

1:38:52.426 --> 1:38:54.531
That's why you can't harm us.

1:38:58.332 --> 1:39:01.040
You trust your wives so much.

1:39:01.268 --> 1:39:03.942
Ok, let's see.

1:39:10.744 --> 1:39:13.987
Hey! What was that noise?
What happened?

1:39:14.048 --> 1:39:16.528
Let's check it out, mom.
-C'mon.

1:39:16.583 --> 1:39:18.392
Out.. out“ run out!

1:39:31.932 --> 1:39:33.809
What's going on here?

1:39:36.103 --> 1:39:37.309
And who is she?

1:39:37.738 --> 1:39:40.241
All of you can see her?

1:39:40.541 --> 1:39:43.647
She's not a ghost
to be invisible to us.

1:39:43.744 --> 1:39:45.951
Who are you and what
are you doing in this house?

1:39:48.182 --> 1:39:50.628
I live here since the last 70 years.

1:39:51.585 --> 1:39:53.394
20 years as a human.

1:39:53.887 --> 1:39:56.697
50 years as a ghost.

1:40:02.997 --> 1:40:05.705
If you're a ghost, then look here.

1:40:05.766 --> 1:40:07.109
I'm a witch.

1:40:11.038 --> 1:40:13.245
Your mom-in-law will
get herself killed. -Really?

1:40:15.009 --> 1:40:19.958
Shut up! She's pretending
to be a ghost in my presence.

1:40:20.014 --> 1:40:23.894
Somebody explain to her
how terrifying I am to ghosts.

1:40:23.984 --> 1:40:27.557
Witches feed their children
by showing my photo.

1:40:27.654 --> 1:40:31.431
They tell them to sleep,
or else the Singing Monk will arrive.

1:40:31.492 --> 1:40:33.233
Isn't it?
-Yes.

1:40:33.293 --> 1:40:35.432
That's why I'm telling you, my child..

1:40:36.196 --> 1:40:39.575
Out.. out“ run out!

1:40:39.633 --> 1:40:42.978
Out.. out“ run out!

1:40:43.070 --> 1:40:47.416
If you're a ghost,
then I'm a large tree.

1:40:47.474 --> 1:40:53.015
Huge organic watermelons
pop out of me all day..

1:40:53.080 --> 1:40:56.926
...for the well-being of mankind.
Isn't it? -Yes.

1:41:01.588 --> 1:41:04.296
Oh no!
-What happened to the master?

1:41:19.907 --> 1:41:20.817
Watermelon!

1:41:23.243 --> 1:41:25.883
Thank god he didn't say pineapple.

1:41:29.850 --> 1:41:32.956
Oh god! She's really a ghost!

1:41:33.020 --> 1:41:34.897
Ghost! Ghost!

1:41:34.955 --> 1:41:38.698
Do you know why I appeared
before all of them?

1:41:39.526 --> 1:41:44.134
So that I can kill the
three of you in their presence.

1:41:44.531 --> 1:41:48.638
Now I'll see how their
fast saves your lives.

1:42:26.607 --> 1:42:28.678
Dad's staff?
-Dad's staff?

1:42:29.676 --> 1:42:31.178
Mine?

1:42:31.645 --> 1:42:32.453
No.

1:42:32.546 --> 1:42:33.718
Dad's staff.

1:42:39.052 --> 1:42:40.963
Dad's staff.

1:42:41.188 --> 1:42:42.895
It seems it's her father's staff.
-What?

1:42:48.695 --> 1:42:51.107
See this.

1:42:51.365 --> 1:42:53.971
She's under control now, the ghost!

1:42:58.739 --> 1:43:01.583
Where were you hiding
all this while? Where?

1:43:02.142 --> 1:43:05.123
You don't know how much
she has troubled us. -Yes.

1:43:05.179 --> 1:43:06.886
Now it's our turn.

1:43:14.087 --> 1:43:16.226
Hey, shut up, what?

1:43:16.423 --> 1:43:19.802
You keep making weird
noises all the time!

1:43:19.860 --> 1:43:20.804
Are you mad?

1:43:22.162 --> 1:43:25.075
Stand quietly or I'll slap you hard.

1:43:25.399 --> 1:43:27.174
Slap? Just a slap?

1:43:27.234 --> 1:43:28.372
You're very soft-hearted, Amar.

1:43:28.435 --> 1:43:31.439
Haven't you heard the adage, ghosts
don't yield to talks, but kicks.

1:43:31.538 --> 1:43:32.710
Hand it to me. -What?

1:43:32.773 --> 1:43:34.150
The staff, what else!

1:43:36.843 --> 1:43:38.288
Give it to me.

1:43:38.378 --> 1:43:40.984
Mad ghost,
you'll pop out watermelons, eh!

1:43:41.048 --> 1:43:44.586
Now see how I make you
pop out a bowl of fruit salad.

1:43:45.252 --> 1:43:46.697
What are you guys doing?

1:43:46.753 --> 1:43:47.925
Let's run from here.

1:43:48.021 --> 1:43:51.764
How can we leave?
The party has just begun.

1:43:52.626 --> 1:43:54.902
C'mon, let's go to the dance floor.

1:44:02.603 --> 1:44:04.514
Burn to ashes, beautiful!

1:44:05.672 --> 1:44:07.549
We're going to make
you die a terrible death.

1:44:07.608 --> 1:44:10.179
And you won't be able to
do anything to us. Take that!

1:44:10.244 --> 1:44:13.885
Exactly. This is known
as killing the snake..

1:44:13.981 --> 1:44:16.018
...without breaking the staff.

1:44:22.122 --> 1:44:23.829
Prem..
-Shut up, Amar.

1:44:24.224 --> 1:44:26.761
You don't know about my fury.

1:44:27.160 --> 1:44:29.162
Once I lose my cool..

1:44:29.263 --> 1:44:31.072
Dad's staff broke.

1:44:31.365 --> 1:44:32.969
...I calm down quickly.

1:44:36.737 --> 1:44:39.240
Oh god, run!

1:44:43.910 --> 1:44:44.888
Brother!

1:44:46.213 --> 1:44:49.319
Atleast everybody is
receiving the shock now.

1:44:51.385 --> 1:44:53.956
Even the watermelon popping
out of me didn't give you the brains.

1:44:54.054 --> 1:44:56.330
Who told you to grab the doors?

1:44:57.057 --> 1:44:58.229
He's mad.

1:44:59.926 --> 1:45:02.167
Two minutes. Just two minutes.

1:45:02.496 --> 1:45:04.703
That's all the time
left for all of you.

1:45:05.165 --> 1:45:08.908
The moment dad's fire burns out,
your pyres will burn.

1:45:12.539 --> 1:45:13.950
What do we do?

1:45:15.008 --> 1:45:15.952
Idea!

1:45:18.345 --> 1:45:19.847
Igor it!

1:45:19.946 --> 1:45:23.086
See this, your dad's underwear.
Fear it!

1:45:24.117 --> 1:45:28.588
You fool, she feared her
father's staff, not his underwear.

1:45:28.655 --> 1:45:31.795
To scare her you've
to call her father directly.

1:45:31.858 --> 1:45:34.168
Yes, but how?
-How..

1:45:34.394 --> 1:45:36.101
The Singing Monk.
-Yes.

1:45:36.163 --> 1:45:37.005
Master!

1:45:37.097 --> 1:45:39.737
Master, only you can save us from her.

1:45:39.800 --> 1:45:41.370
I don't know to summon spirits.

1:45:41.435 --> 1:45:42.539
What?!
-Yes.

1:45:42.602 --> 1:45:46.140
See, I press the buttons
on this to move the coin.

1:45:47.274 --> 1:45:47.809
What?

1:45:47.874 --> 1:45:53.290
Not this ghost,
I'll choke you to death.

1:45:53.380 --> 1:45:57.829
C'mon, just chill.
It's dirty, but it's business.

1:45:57.884 --> 1:46:00.023
Sire, give me the bag.
Give me the bag.

1:46:00.220 --> 1:46:01.460
It seems we'll have
to do something. -Yes.

1:46:01.555 --> 1:46:03.057
Bloody imposter! Let's go.

1:46:07.828 --> 1:46:08.932
Place your fingers on it.

1:46:09.029 --> 1:46:10.508
Wherever you are daddy' spirit,
please appear!

1:46:10.564 --> 1:46:13.511
Wherever you are daddy' spirit,
please appear!

1:46:13.567 --> 1:46:16.605
Wherever you are daddy' spirit,
please appear!

1:46:16.703 --> 1:46:20.446
Wherever you are daddy' spirit,
please appear!

1:46:20.540 --> 1:46:22.577
Oh man! Why isn't this coin moving?

1:46:22.642 --> 1:46:25.714
Buddy, before I die,
I want to say something honestly.

1:46:25.779 --> 1:46:27.781
I know that it's my idea
that gets us killed every time.

1:46:31.218 --> 1:46:32.663
The coin moved.

1:46:33.253 --> 1:46:34.095
HOW?

1:46:36.523 --> 1:46:38.400
Truth along triumphs.

1:46:38.892 --> 1:46:40.269
I understood.

1:46:40.327 --> 1:46:41.738
My father used to say..

1:46:41.795 --> 1:46:44.901
...that to summon a spirit, the mind
should be clean and the soul honest.

1:46:44.965 --> 1:46:47.138
But I always resorted to lies.

1:46:47.200 --> 1:46:48.941
That's why I could
never summon a spirit.

1:46:49.002 --> 1:46:51.608
But the moment Prem spoke the truth,
the coin moved.

1:46:52.906 --> 1:46:55.750
That means, if we speak the truth,
the coin will move?

1:46:55.809 --> 1:46:56.947
Yes, it surely will.

1:46:57.277 --> 1:46:59.382
Then what are you wondering?
Speak the truth quickly.

1:46:59.446 --> 1:47:00.516
But what?

1:47:00.580 --> 1:47:05.325
Say that you can't find
a better mom-in-law than me.

1:47:06.386 --> 1:47:08.627
I can't find a better
mom-in-law than you.

1:47:13.827 --> 1:47:15.067
Speak the truth.

1:47:15.128 --> 1:47:16.698
Amar, the fire is burning out.

1:47:18.732 --> 1:47:20.336
Sneak m

1:47:20.700 --> 1:47:23.180
You're a mad old woman.

1:47:23.570 --> 1:47:25.413
You've ruined my life.

1:47:25.605 --> 1:47:27.710
If you really miss
your husband so much..

1:47:27.774 --> 1:47:31.722
...then instead of bringing him down
to earth, why don't you go up instead?

1:47:31.778 --> 1:47:33.451
You'll be happy and so will I.

1:47:33.547 --> 1:47:36.289
The whole world will be happy,
damn you!

1:47:36.383 --> 1:47:37.555
Damn yuu?

1:47:37.751 --> 1:47:39.059
Shut up, Amar.

1:47:43.690 --> 1:47:46.864
The coin moved.
-The coin moved.

1:47:46.927 --> 1:47:49.203
Well done, Amar. Continue.
-Yes.

1:47:50.063 --> 1:47:51.770
Hey, what do you mean by continue?

1:47:51.865 --> 1:47:53.344
Will I alone speak the truth?

1:47:53.400 --> 1:47:55.311
You also speak the truth
about your brother-in-law.

1:47:55.836 --> 1:47:57.543
What about me?

1:47:57.604 --> 1:48:02.713
Nothing, just that you're
the apple of my eyes. My darling.

1:48:02.776 --> 1:48:04.551
Thank you, Meet.

1:48:05.979 --> 1:48:07.515
The coin isn't moving.

1:48:07.581 --> 1:48:08.958
Meet, the fire..

1:48:10.851 --> 1:48:12.455
Speak up!

1:48:12.986 --> 1:48:16.024
You're not the apple of my eyes,
but the rot in my love life.

1:48:16.089 --> 1:48:17.659
You cross-connection!

1:48:17.757 --> 1:48:21.933
Seeing you, I realised why
people curse their brothers-in-law.

1:48:22.028 --> 1:48:23.974
You're not a human, but a wild bull.

1:48:24.064 --> 1:48:25.941
Not a wild bull, but a donkey's.

1:48:26.733 --> 1:48:28.007
Did you understand?

1:48:28.101 --> 1:48:31.048
He called me a bull.

1:48:31.371 --> 1:48:33.942
I hate you, Meet. I hate you!

1:48:38.411 --> 1:48:41.688
The coin moved.
-The coin moved.

1:48:41.781 --> 1:48:43.226
The coin moved.

1:48:43.283 --> 1:48:45.593
Prem, it's your turn now.

1:48:45.652 --> 1:48:46.653
Say it.

1:48:48.755 --> 1:48:51.201
My name is Prem. I'm a man.

1:48:51.258 --> 1:48:53.067
I'm 32 years old.

1:48:54.394 --> 1:48:57.375
You loser, we're not submitting
our bio-data for a job.

1:48:57.464 --> 1:49:01.037
You've to speak the true
feelings of your heart, rascal.

1:49:05.906 --> 1:49:08.079
Prem, speak the truth.

1:49:08.942 --> 1:49:11.923
One needs brains to think
and you lack it, foolish girl.

1:49:11.978 --> 1:49:14.618
You keep saying, 'Prem shook..'

1:49:14.714 --> 1:49:16.318
Not me, but you're
shaken in your head.

1:49:16.383 --> 1:49:20.798
Because of you sleeping between us my
rat is suffering from plague. Plague!

1:49:21.821 --> 1:49:23.494
Sisten.
-Sorry, dean.

1:49:24.391 --> 1:49:25.893
What nonsense are you talking?

1:49:29.529 --> 1:49:32.635
Prem, the coin moved. Oh!

1:49:32.699 --> 1:49:33.700
That's done.

1:49:33.767 --> 1:49:35.678
Now, we just need
to speak one more truth.

1:49:36.002 --> 1:49:39.108
Enough. Dare you say another word.

1:49:39.506 --> 1:49:42.749
Do you hate our family
members so much? -Yes, we do.

1:49:43.777 --> 1:49:44.983
Do you know why?

1:49:45.712 --> 1:49:47.692
Because they keep us away from you.

1:49:48.048 --> 1:49:50.358
You turn a blind eye
to us in their presence.

1:49:50.750 --> 1:49:52.457
That's why we came
here to cheat on you.

1:49:55.355 --> 1:49:56.925
But now we realise..

1:49:57.390 --> 1:50:00.599
...that we were cheating
ourselves and not you.

1:50:04.331 --> 1:50:08.905
Because all the fun in the
world can't match up to your love.

1:50:12.305 --> 1:50:14.216
And today, we swear on that love..

1:50:14.941 --> 1:50:18.548
...that we'll die but never betray you.

1:51:01.121 --> 1:51:04.000
Dad..
-Not your dad, but Babu.

1:51:04.224 --> 1:51:06.295
I'm Babu Rangeela.

1:51:06.393 --> 1:51:09.272
I'm of loose character.

1:51:11.965 --> 1:51:14.172
Because once I commit.

1:51:14.234 --> 1:51:16.407
...then he doesn't listen even to me.

1:51:41.227 --> 1:51:45.300
Even I have a staff
to bring you under control.

1:51:52.739 --> 1:51:53.649
Babu.

1:51:53.707 --> 1:51:55.380
Rangeela.

1:51:56.509 --> 1:51:58.045
I loves you.

1:52:36.549 --> 1:52:37.425
WOW!

1:52:53.066 --> 1:52:54.204
Crazy.. Choti?

1:52:54.267 --> 1:52:55.405
Bull.. Lakshman?

1:52:55.468 --> 1:52:56.742
Choti, aren't you ashamed?

1:52:56.803 --> 1:52:58.373
What will the elders of
the house think if they see you?

1:52:58.438 --> 1:52:59.644
What will they think?

1:52:59.739 --> 1:53:02.948
Sorry, we made a mistake.

1:53:04.444 --> 1:53:05.923
They did a mistake.

1:53:14.354 --> 1:53:15.059
MOm!

1:53:15.121 --> 1:53:16.794
Dad! I mean, master!

1:53:16.890 --> 1:53:20.235
Not master, but the master's staff.

1:53:22.929 --> 1:53:24.374
They're talking about your mother.

1:53:25.298 --> 1:53:26.242
Come.

1:53:26.866 --> 1:53:28.038
Mom..

1:53:28.434 --> 1:53:30.744
Earlier, she used to be shameless
and look at her blush now.

1:53:32.972 --> 1:53:33.973
Dad.. hello.

1:53:34.040 --> 1:53:36.042
Forget the hello and quickly
touch my feet, you fool.

1:53:36.109 --> 1:53:38.089
Why quickly?
-We've to go on a honeymoon.

1:53:38.144 --> 1:53:40.249
Oh.. everybody goes on one.

1:53:43.049 --> 1:53:45.188
Thanks, Babu.

1:53:45.518 --> 1:53:47.657
You saved the lives of our husbands.

1:53:47.720 --> 1:53:50.200
But you came to see the
house yesterday, isn't it?

1:53:50.423 --> 1:53:52.198
Then how did you die all of a sudden?

1:53:55.995 --> 1:53:57.099
What happened?

1:53:57.764 --> 1:54:00.506
Don't eat chicken ever again.
Become vegetarians.

1:54:00.700 --> 1:54:01.644
Ok.

1:54:01.801 --> 1:54:02.779
Ok.

1:54:03.770 --> 1:54:07.582
Sorry, I troubled all of you.

1:54:09.075 --> 1:54:12.318
But what could I do?
That's the nature of fun.

1:54:12.712 --> 1:54:15.454
You didn't get it for six months
and this was your condition.

1:54:15.715 --> 1:54:18.924
Think about it..
I waited for 50 years.

1:54:19.419 --> 1:54:20.659
It's alright.

1:54:21.154 --> 1:54:22.258
We can understand.

1:54:22.355 --> 1:54:24.892
In fact, we should be thanking you.

1:54:24.958 --> 1:54:25.868
Thank you, Ragu.

1:54:25.925 --> 1:54:28.963
Your horror story
set our love story right.
