00:12.962 --> 00:13.912
Here're you guys,

00:14.362 --> 00:15.102
enjoy.

00:18.262 --> 00:19.662
Nothing beats drinkin'

00:19.662 --> 00:21.562
joe with my bro!

00:22.352 --> 00:23.392
Right, Mordecai?

00:23.862 --> 00:24.262
What?

00:24.632 --> 00:25.602
Yeeeeeaaahh.

00:28.082 --> 00:29.252
Dude,

00:31.742 --> 00:32.142
Dude!

00:32.272 --> 00:33.712
Margaret totally just smiled at me.

00:33.942 --> 00:34.862
No she didn't.

00:34.862 --> 00:35.832
Yes she did.

00:35.832 --> 00:37.192
Then why don't you ask her out?

00:37.902 --> 00:39.002
It's not that easy.

00:39.202 --> 00:40.482
You wouldn't understand.

00:40.952 --> 00:41.852
I wouldn't understand.

00:42.002 --> 00:43.992
Probably 'cos I'm too busy drinking joe with

00:43.992 --> 00:46.982
my bro like we came here to do in the first place,
remember?

00:46.982 --> 00:47.342
Wait.

00:48.322 --> 00:49.772
I once was lost,

00:50.182 --> 00:50.952
but now..

00:51.262 --> 00:52.362
I'm found.

00:57.202 --> 00:58.042
DudeTime,

00:59.062 --> 00:59.882
for men.

01:00.822 --> 01:02.842
What kind of loser would want a bunch of chicks

01:02.842 --> 01:04.302
tearing their clothes off?

01:04.391 --> 01:05.532
Right, Mordecai?

01:12.212 --> 01:13.192
Mordecai.

01:13.602 --> 01:14.462
Hey Margaret.

01:14.872 --> 01:16.052
Didn't notice you there.

01:16.072 --> 01:17.272
Gee Mordecai,

01:17.502 --> 01:19.992
I don't think I've ever realized how awesome you are.

01:20.272 --> 01:22.402
And you smell great too.

01:22.802 --> 01:23.782
Mordecai.

01:23.862 --> 01:24.932
Mordecai.

01:25.082 --> 01:25.952
Mordecai?

01:25.982 --> 01:26.802
Mordecai?

01:27.442 --> 01:27.942
Dude.

01:28.152 --> 01:29.462
I'm buying that cologne.

01:30.602 --> 01:31.402
Why?

01:31.482 --> 01:33.712
You said you would chip in for that awesome new game.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.552
I'm John.

01:36.602 --> 01:38.342
I'm also John.

01:38.412 --> 01:41.042
We're the Strong Johns!

01:41.992 --> 01:43.322
Strong Johns, Strong Johns!

01:43.322 --> 01:44.782
You have to buy Strong Johns!

01:44.782 --> 01:46.142
Strong Johns, Strong Johns!

01:46.142 --> 01:47.952
You gotta buy Strong Johns!

01:52.582 --> 01:54.252
Now do want that game?

01:54.302 --> 01:55.242
No.

01:55.242 --> 01:56.652
I still want the cologne.

01:56.912 --> 01:59.972
If you buy that cologne then
I'm gonna lose all respect for you.

02:00.032 --> 02:00.542
Good.

02:00.822 --> 02:02.992
Then we'll both have the same amount of respect for each other.

02:03.712 --> 02:04.892
What's with you?

02:04.962 --> 02:06.242
We had a plan:

02:06.252 --> 02:07.832
coffee, Strong Johns, hang out!

02:07.862 --> 02:09.572
Dude, we can hang out later.

02:09.632 --> 02:11.932
I just wanna go buy some that cologne really quick.

02:12.032 --> 02:12.472
No.

02:12.472 --> 02:13.712
That wasn't part of the plan!

02:13.712 --> 02:14.482
If you leave,

02:14.512 --> 02:16.322
then I'm gonna have to get some new friends!

02:16.372 --> 02:17.042
That's cool.

02:17.042 --> 02:19.242
I'll probably be too busy with the ladies anyway.

02:19.242 --> 02:19.932
Well fine.

02:19.982 --> 02:21.962
I'll be busy with my new friends!

02:22.142 --> 02:23.412
Plan-breaker!

02:38.282 --> 02:40.452
Are you done with your stupid cologne yet?

02:40.582 --> 02:42.222
You know that stuff's not gonna work.

02:42.402 --> 02:43.502
Why don't you get out of here?

02:43.502 --> 02:44.682
You don't know anything.

02:44.682 --> 02:45.642
Mordecai.

02:45.642 --> 02:46.462
Rigby.

02:46.462 --> 02:47.752
wonderful day we're hav-

02:55.652 --> 02:56.872
In your face!

02:56.872 --> 02:58.772
I knew that stuff wasn't gonna work.

02:58.772 --> 02:59.492
Shut up!

02:59.562 --> 03:00.892
I'm not trying to attract Pops,

03:00.892 --> 03:02.122
I'm trying to attract Margaret.

03:02.222 --> 03:03.832
She's probably on her way right now.

03:08.602 --> 03:09.242
Margaret?

03:09.492 --> 03:10.872
I'm over here.

03:10.972 --> 03:11.392
Margar-?

03:11.392 --> 03:12.252
Oh, geez!

03:15.242 --> 03:16.322
Whaddaya got there?

03:16.482 --> 03:17.302
DudeTime?

03:17.802 --> 03:18.722
I knew it!

03:18.722 --> 03:20.242
Come out, bros, come out!

03:20.242 --> 03:22.312
I told you it was DudeTime!

03:22.612 --> 03:23.672
Alright!

03:23.712 --> 03:24.942
DudeTime!

03:26.332 --> 03:27.732
DudeTime, bros!!

03:30.852 --> 03:32.622
Did someone say there's

03:32.652 --> 03:34.432
DudeTime down here?

03:34.562 --> 03:36.452
Can I bum a spray, can I bum a spray?

03:38.052 --> 03:39.522
Who are these guys?

03:39.572 --> 03:40.242
I dunno.

03:40.292 --> 03:41.882
They seem pretty cool, though!

03:42.312 --> 03:43.822
You bros wanna hang out?

03:44.642 --> 03:45.622
I wanna hang out!

03:45.802 --> 03:46.102
But..

03:46.182 --> 03:47.922
you're wasting your time with this guy.

03:47.922 --> 03:50.192
All he wants to do is get with Margaret.

03:50.372 --> 03:51.472
Margaret?

03:51.662 --> 03:54.112
That doesn't sound like a dude's name.

03:54.112 --> 03:56.722
Are you using DudeTime to get the ladies?

03:57.252 --> 03:57.842
So what?

03:59.452 --> 04:00.742
No, bro!

04:00.822 --> 04:02.962
You don't use this to get the ladies.

04:03.042 --> 04:05.442
You use it to hang out with the bros!

04:05.442 --> 04:07.162
Bros!

04:08.562 --> 04:10.862
Finally somebody's speaking my language!

04:10.862 --> 04:15.402
Bros!

04:16.601 --> 04:18.492
Little dude makes me laugh.

04:18.772 --> 04:19.772
Seriously though.

04:19.932 --> 04:21.712
You're pretty cool, too, for letting us

04:21.712 --> 04:23.152
bum some of your DudeTime,

04:23.152 --> 04:24.042
so...

04:24.192 --> 04:26.112
if you really wanna attract the ladies,

04:26.482 --> 04:27.222
we can help.

04:27.532 --> 04:28.112
Really?

04:29.622 --> 04:32.002
We know all about the ladies.

04:39.082 --> 04:39.832
Actually,

04:39.962 --> 04:41.652
that would be pretty awesome, guys.

04:41.702 --> 04:42.242
Cool.

04:42.242 --> 04:43.742
Just point us to the lady.

04:45.902 --> 04:47.192
This is where she works.

04:47.452 --> 04:48.522
What do I gotta do?

04:48.942 --> 04:50.112
we'll tell you what to do,

04:50.272 --> 04:51.702
but first you have to drink

04:51.702 --> 04:53.982
from the Cup of Knowledge.

04:59.192 --> 05:00.112
Sick!

05:00.172 --> 05:01.212
What was that?!

05:01.242 --> 05:02.982
It's definitely not

05:02.982 --> 05:04.982
unicorn slomp!

05:06.182 --> 05:08.442
How is that supposed to get me a lady?

05:08.562 --> 05:09.542
Chill out, bro.

05:09.542 --> 05:10.962
We're just having a little fun.

05:11.482 --> 05:11.932
Fun!

05:12.012 --> 05:13.112
Ever hear of it?

05:13.142 --> 05:14.652
Quit bein' such a jerk!

05:17.522 --> 05:18.382
Come on!

05:18.592 --> 05:20.412
We won't mess with you anymore.

05:20.532 --> 05:21.662
I promise.

05:21.862 --> 05:24.022
Got a great way to help you get your lad.

05:24.662 --> 05:25.212
Great.

05:25.422 --> 05:27.112
As long as I don't have to stand next to that

05:27.112 --> 05:29.112
total loser I'm up for anything.

05:33.412 --> 05:34.472
'Kay, check it:

05:34.662 --> 05:37.422
the ladies love dudes who slick their hair back.

05:37.882 --> 05:39.132
Jimmy, give 'im the stuff.

05:39.392 --> 05:40.702
Here, use this!

05:41.802 --> 05:42.512
FIne.

05:45.482 --> 05:47.932
Are you sure she'll be into this?

05:48.112 --> 05:50.722
Totally, bro, she'll be all about it.

05:50.782 --> 05:52.032
All you gotta do is

05:52.312 --> 05:53.512
lay it down.

05:53.822 --> 05:54.852
Lay it down?

05:55.312 --> 05:56.152
Bro, you know:

05:56.152 --> 05:57.382
lay it down!

06:07.222 --> 06:07.972
Can I help you?

06:08.812 --> 06:10.272
Hey, Margaret..

06:11.072 --> 06:11.832
Mordecai?

06:14.192 --> 06:14.832
What's up?

06:14.952 --> 06:15.882
I'm uh,

06:15.932 --> 06:17.122
I'm here to... l

06:17.122 --> 06:18.332
lay it down.

06:18.482 --> 06:19.122
What?

06:19.352 --> 06:20.632
Lay it... down?

06:21.982 --> 06:22.702
Sure.

06:22.982 --> 06:24.112
Are you feeling OK?

06:24.932 --> 06:25.592
Yeah,

06:25.752 --> 06:26.792
I'm great, uh,

06:27.152 --> 06:28.082
I'll be right back.

06:28.442 --> 06:29.792
What the H, guys?

06:29.792 --> 06:30.812
Not cool!

06:30.812 --> 06:32.282
Chill out, bro!

06:32.332 --> 06:34.552
We're watching you in there and little dude

06:34.552 --> 06:35.772
had a really good point.

06:36.092 --> 06:37.412
What point?

06:37.492 --> 06:39.412
That we're totally not hanging out enough.

06:40.792 --> 06:41.712
Don't worry.

06:41.942 --> 06:43.612
We're still gonna help you get your lad.

06:44.072 --> 06:44.632
How?

06:44.912 --> 06:46.912
By partying at your place!

06:47.242 --> 06:47.952
Wait what?!

06:50.332 --> 06:52.252
Party!

06:59.932 --> 07:00.462
Dude,

07:00.602 --> 07:02.162
these guys aren't trying to help me.

07:02.162 --> 07:03.572
They're just messing with me.

07:03.642 --> 07:04.992
Dude, they're just partying.

07:05.042 --> 07:07.612
How is this supposed to help me get the ladies?

07:07.612 --> 07:09.062
They got you a lady!

07:10.392 --> 07:12.652
That's not a lady.

07:14.942 --> 07:16.542
I thought you were gonna help me with Margaret.

07:16.542 --> 07:17.992
Something's touching me!

07:20.982 --> 07:23.052
Hey, bros, check this out.

07:23.952 --> 07:25.212
Here, let me help you up.

07:27.232 --> 07:29.282
Why don't you ask Margaret to help you up?

07:31.142 --> 07:32.272
You know what, Rigby?

07:32.272 --> 07:34.672
Have fun with your new friends, you jerk.

07:34.832 --> 07:36.112
Oh, and just so you know,

07:36.162 --> 07:39.022
when Benson finds out about your
friends and their little hangout time,

07:39.072 --> 07:40.712
he's probably gonna fire ya.

07:40.992 --> 07:42.322
Later, bro.

07:42.482 --> 07:43.862
Mordecai, wait!

07:44.172 --> 07:46.652
Bros! I found a trampoline!

07:46.652 --> 07:48.362
NO!

07:48.572 --> 07:50.072
What are you doing to my bed?

07:50.102 --> 07:51.792
You sleep on this, bro?!

07:51.792 --> 07:52.602
Get off it!

07:52.602 --> 07:54.532
Right after this somersault.

07:55.812 --> 07:56.442
Bros,

07:56.442 --> 07:58.572
this trampoline's all over me.

07:58.622 --> 08:00.182
Help me get it off!

08:05.122 --> 08:06.402
My bed!

08:07.092 --> 08:07.882
Hey, bro.

08:07.912 --> 08:09.602
You know this nerd?

08:09.672 --> 08:10.182
Rigby!

08:10.182 --> 08:12.132
When I get out of here I'll kill you!

08:12.132 --> 08:13.122
Check this out.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.242
What's the matter, Rigbone?

08:17.272 --> 08:19.192
You like that nerd or something?

08:19.222 --> 08:20.272
Yeah, dude.

08:20.272 --> 08:21.292
Chill out.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.772
And have a drink!

08:36.352 --> 08:37.022
Hey, Mordecai-

08:37.022 --> 08:38.072
Don't touch me!

08:39.381 --> 08:40.092
Hey, so,

08:40.142 --> 08:41.432
 I sorta need your help.

08:41.432 --> 08:43.802
Why don't you ask your new bros for help?

08:43.852 --> 08:45.002
Dude, get over it!

08:45.002 --> 08:46.052
It's not my fault!

08:46.052 --> 08:48.482
If you would have just hung out
with me and played some Strong Johns,

08:48.482 --> 08:49.892
none of this woulda happened.

08:49.892 --> 08:50.412
Look.

08:50.412 --> 08:51.662
I'm sorry about the game,

08:51.662 --> 08:54.092
but that doesn't give you the right to treat me like garbage!

08:54.162 --> 08:55.642
You owe me an apology!

08:55.822 --> 08:56.642
 I'm sorry.

08:56.692 --> 08:58.572
A real apology.

08:58.712 --> 08:59.622
OK, I'm sorry.

08:59.622 --> 09:00.662
I'm... sorry!

09:00.662 --> 09:02.502
Is that what you wanted to hear?

09:02.502 --> 09:04.172
I miss you!

09:04.832 --> 09:07.462
I miss you!

09:08.062 --> 09:08.702
OK.

09:08.702 --> 09:09.982
Quit being a baby.

09:13.142 --> 09:13.942
Why?!

09:14.142 --> 09:15.682
That's for psyching me.

09:17.912 --> 09:20.132
It's gonna suck for you when Benson gets untied.

09:20.262 --> 09:21.642
Dude, you have to help me.

09:21.752 --> 09:23.442
Way ahead of you, bro.

09:25.382 --> 09:26.432
Hey Skips.

09:26.482 --> 09:27.522
We have a problem.

09:27.702 --> 09:28.962
Unicorns?

09:29.342 --> 09:30.012
How'd you know?

09:30.452 --> 09:32.152
They peed on my lawn.

09:33.292 --> 09:35.002
So, how do we get rid of them?

09:35.082 --> 09:36.872
Well, that's really hard.

09:36.972 --> 09:39.012
They're like insects, but...

09:40.732 --> 09:43.902
there's one thing unicorns never say no to.

09:45.892 --> 09:47.172
Drag racing.

09:54.232 --> 09:56.412
You guys know what to do, right?

09:57.672 --> 09:58.682
Hey, Rigby.

09:58.762 --> 10:00.782
Weren't we supposed to race some unicorns,

10:00.782 --> 10:02.712
and not a bunch of losers?

10:02.712 --> 10:06.192
You're dead! You're gonna die!

10:06.192 --> 10:07.412
Bros! Bros!

10:07.412 --> 10:09.182
Horseless carriages...

10:09.182 --> 10:11.002
Bros, bros!

10:11.002 --> 10:12.252
..commence!

10:14.352 --> 10:17.312
This is how you get rid of unicorns.

10:20.902 --> 10:22.282
But what if they come back?

10:22.282 --> 10:24.092
They ain't comin' back!

10:28.132 --> 10:29.772
Cool!

10:29.902 --> 10:32.902
That's the only way to get rid of unicorns.

10:36.502 --> 10:39.702
 I can't believe you idiots let those unicorns in here.

10:39.912 --> 10:42.752
You two morons had better get this mess cleaned up

10:42.792 --> 10:45.482
or you'll wish it was you driving that car!!!

10:45.532 --> 10:46.682
The unicorn one?

10:47.712 --> 10:48.712
Cold!

10:49.322 --> 10:50.012
And you!

10:50.552 --> 10:54.232
Quit sprayin' that cologne,
it's not gonna get you any ladies.

10:54.482 --> 10:55.262
Idiots.

10:56.912 --> 10:57.792
Wanna go...

10:57.892 --> 10:58.502
bro?

10:58.942 --> 10:59.912
Strong Johns?

11:00.062 --> 11:00.702
Yeah.
