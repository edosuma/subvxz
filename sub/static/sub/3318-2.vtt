WEBVTT

00:03.737 --> 00:07.706
<i>Since mary, queen of scotland,</i>
<i>was a child,</i>

00:07.708 --> 00:11.343
<i>The english have wanted</i>
<i>her country and her crown.</i>

00:13.013 --> 00:16.315
<i>She is sent to France</i>
<i>to wed its next king,</i>

00:16.317 --> 00:18.617
To save herself and her people,

00:18.619 --> 00:21.220
A bond that should protect her,

00:21.222 --> 00:24.156
<i>But there are forces</i>
<i>that conspire,</i>

00:24.158 --> 00:28.327
<i>Forces of darkness,</i>
<i>forces of the heart.</i>

00:28.329 --> 00:31.296
<i>Long may she reign.</i>

00:31.298 --> 00:33.599
<i>Previously on</i> reign:
Nostradamus:
<i>I saw your son's future,</i>

00:33.601 --> 00:35.067
<i>His union with mary.</i>

00:35.069 --> 00:36.435
She will cost francis his life.

00:36.437 --> 00:38.637
We've been engaged
since we were six.

00:38.639 --> 00:41.173
An alliance with scotland
could destroy France.
You don't want to marry me.

00:41.175 --> 00:42.608
Catherine:
<i>You said the potion</i>
<i>would make her</i>

00:42.610 --> 00:44.309
<i>Sleep like the dead.</i>
<i>One glass of wine,</i>

00:44.311 --> 00:45.477
<i>And she'd wake</i>
<i>with her virtue destroyed.</i>

00:45.479 --> 00:47.513
(screams)
colin! No!

00:47.515 --> 00:48.580
He said he was forced.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.449
Colin mcphail is my subject.

00:50.451 --> 00:52.051
I demand to speak with him.

00:52.053 --> 00:53.585
Colin's been executed.
(grunts)

00:53.587 --> 00:55.320
He was beheaded this morning.

00:57.323 --> 01:00.392
(groaning)

01:01.528 --> 01:04.296
(panting)

01:04.298 --> 01:06.465
(groaning, panting)

01:06.467 --> 01:08.467
You're done for now, boy.

01:08.469 --> 01:11.170
Don't get
too comfortable.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.305
(panting)

01:21.581 --> 01:23.449
Woman (quietly):
Wake up.

01:23.451 --> 01:24.683
Wake up.

01:24.685 --> 01:27.219
Go. Go.

01:36.396 --> 01:37.529
(shouts)

01:37.531 --> 01:38.597
(groans)

01:39.566 --> 01:40.699
Who are you?!

01:43.536 --> 01:46.138
Why did you free me?

01:46.140 --> 01:48.674
(grunts)

01:51.711 --> 01:54.246
(birds chirping)

01:55.748 --> 01:57.616
(knocking, door creaks open)

01:57.618 --> 02:00.452
Lady kenna, lady aylee and
greer of kinross, your grace.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.821
Thank you, sarah.

02:02.823 --> 02:05.524
You slept there while
lola slept in your bed?

02:05.526 --> 02:07.392
We were talking
about what happened to colin.

02:07.394 --> 02:09.361
She fell asleep crying.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.263
I feel for her.

02:11.265 --> 02:14.500
And for colin.

02:16.503 --> 02:18.270
The french king and queen said

02:18.272 --> 02:20.439
Colin's attack on me
was an english plot.

02:20.441 --> 02:22.541
But colin told lola
it was someone here,

02:22.543 --> 02:24.810
Highly placed at french court.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.778
All I know is it had
to be someone opposed

02:26.780 --> 02:27.779
To scotland's alliance

02:27.781 --> 02:29.148
With France.

02:29.150 --> 02:31.483
My engagement to francis.

02:32.452 --> 02:34.720
England wants
my country

02:34.722 --> 02:36.321
And my crown.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.290
I need the alliance with France

02:38.292 --> 02:39.558
To protect scotland
from the english,

02:39.560 --> 02:41.293
And I need time

02:41.295 --> 02:44.429
Before there's any chance
of francis marrying me.

02:44.431 --> 02:46.165
I won't have time

02:46.167 --> 02:49.334
If I don't figure out
who's against me.

02:53.273 --> 02:55.207
Catherine:
Let's agree-- it's
a brilliant match.

02:55.209 --> 02:57.176
Madeleine's french,
so there's no question

02:57.178 --> 02:58.810
Of her family's loyalty.

02:58.812 --> 03:01.180
Very wealthy.
But not royal,

03:01.182 --> 03:02.548
So they're hungry
for power.

03:02.550 --> 03:03.749
Catherine:
They'll pay for it.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.217
Henry: It's only
right to accept

03:05.219 --> 03:06.752
The support
of one's loyal subjects.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.620
Mmm.
(gasps)

03:08.622 --> 03:11.390
And she has a giraffe.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.592
Well, madeleine's
widely traveled.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.494
She's come from
far away. By ship.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.229
Do I get a giraffe, too?

03:17.231 --> 03:18.797
The moment she's
your bride.

03:18.799 --> 03:21.600
Francis, to show our respect,

03:21.602 --> 03:24.269
I want you to accompany your
little brother to the landing.

03:24.271 --> 03:25.571
Can bash come as well?

03:25.573 --> 03:27.239
Catherine:
Charlie.

03:27.241 --> 03:29.608
You know that bash isn't
really your brother.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.643
He's just your father's son.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.512
His presence is disrespectful.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.414
Henry:
The girl's parents
were enjoying morocco,

03:35.416 --> 03:37.349
So they sent her on alone.

03:37.351 --> 03:39.685
Barely. She was more afraid
of meeting her future husband

03:39.687 --> 03:41.520
Than of pirates.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.722
Well, that's to be
expected at age seven.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.424
She'll get in line.

03:45.426 --> 03:46.758
We all do.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.260
Perhaps I can go

03:48.262 --> 03:49.528
With francis?

03:49.530 --> 03:51.463
I came here, too,
when I was a child.

03:51.465 --> 03:53.498
Perhaps I can
reassure her.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.267
It's several hours' journey.

03:55.269 --> 03:57.502
Then we'll take food and treats.
I don't mind, really.

03:57.504 --> 03:59.972
On second thought, why don't
we greet the girl here?

03:59.974 --> 04:02.374
We don't know-- the journey
might not be safe.

04:02.376 --> 04:03.575
They'll stay on the king's road.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.910
A dozen
well-armed guards

04:04.912 --> 04:06.578
Will keep
any bandits away.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.948
Prepare a carriage for
mary, queen of scotland.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.379
(men shouting in distance)

05:17.350 --> 05:18.583
There are too many boats.

05:22.455 --> 05:24.523
That's not a french ship.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.725
Those are english.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.994
Is that a warship?

05:28.996 --> 05:31.563
Yes.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.605
Guards!
What are they doing here?

05:40.607 --> 05:42.507
I don't know.
I think it's a hostile landing.

05:42.509 --> 05:45.344
But England and France
are at peace.

05:45.346 --> 05:46.812
Have they come for me?

05:46.814 --> 05:48.880
Get mary out of here.

05:48.882 --> 05:49.881
Hide her.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.484
Mary, can you ride?
Yes.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.553

No! Wait! Don't shoot!

06:01.362 --> 06:02.494
Stand down!

06:02.496 --> 06:03.695
There's an english warship.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.364
The english come in peace.

06:07.133 --> 06:09.701
The french ship took on water--
it was in distress.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.503
The english were nearby
and gave rescue.

06:11.505 --> 06:12.537
How do you know this?

06:12.539 --> 06:13.672
They sent an emissary
on ahead

06:13.674 --> 06:15.107
To the castle.
He's being held.

06:15.109 --> 06:16.775
If they're lying,
they'll have his head.

07:43.864 --> 07:46.631
To the english fighters
at the shore.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.000
And there's simon,
the english envoy.

07:49.002 --> 07:51.603
I've put him up in a guest suite
while he's at court,

07:51.605 --> 07:54.005
Along with the captain of the
ship and some of his officers.

07:54.007 --> 07:57.142
Catherine: There's plenty
of english to go around.
Mmm.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.777
Catherine:
Some of England's
finest warriors

07:58.779 --> 08:01.179
That just happened
to be aboard that ship.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.682
Aren't you the kind host?

08:03.684 --> 08:06.485
Treat them as friends until
they prove themselves foes.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.019
They'll be gone
in a few days,

08:08.021 --> 08:09.921
Replenished
and on their way.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.790
Ah.

08:14.126 --> 08:17.028
I would think the english would
be among your favorite guests.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.263
Because they hate mary?

08:18.265 --> 08:19.931
Well,

08:19.933 --> 08:22.801
If only their aggression
were limited to scotland.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.135
But they want France, too.

08:24.137 --> 08:26.037
They want everything.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.173
Thus the alliance with scotland.
Mmm.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.909
The one you tried to destroy
by blackmailing a boy

08:30.911 --> 08:33.512
Into taking mary's virtue
by force.

08:33.514 --> 08:34.846
Well, if it had worked,

08:34.848 --> 08:36.681
Francis might evade the fate
you predict.

08:36.683 --> 08:40.185
How do I tell my son
you see his death?

08:40.187 --> 08:43.588
That his union with
mary will be the cause?

08:43.590 --> 08:45.590
Francis doesn't believe
in prophecies.

08:45.592 --> 08:46.892
He'd ignore it.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.628
I trust your visions
and your counsel.

08:49.630 --> 08:52.130
So let us keep our secrets

08:52.132 --> 08:53.798
And let them rest in peace

08:53.800 --> 08:57.002
With the scottish boy
who carried them out.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.870
You're english, lord westbrook,
but you say

08:58.872 --> 09:01.106
That you did not come
with the warship?

09:01.108 --> 09:02.807
You reside in France?

09:02.809 --> 09:05.744
I have a home in paris,
but I often stay at court.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.145
Call me simon, please.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.947
So we can be friendly

09:08.949 --> 09:10.282
And frank
with one another.

09:10.284 --> 09:12.017
Not like the french
who simply say

09:12.019 --> 09:13.685
What you want to hear.

09:13.687 --> 09:16.021
How is your engagement going?

09:16.023 --> 09:17.956
Quite well. We're very happy.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.224
Then why haven't you set a date?

09:19.226 --> 09:22.060
Charles and madeleine
are only seven,

09:22.062 --> 09:25.096
But they'll be wed
on her 14th birthday.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.332
France's commitment to scotland
is hollow.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.701
They're playing
both sides.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.236
If you were threatened,
would they really come

09:31.238 --> 09:32.971
To your defense?
I believe that is

09:32.973 --> 09:35.307
The very definition
of an alliance.

09:35.309 --> 09:37.576
But, of course, you knew that.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.945
I know this
from one look at you.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.813
You're of age.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.315
You should be married.

09:43.317 --> 09:44.683
Are you proposing?

09:44.685 --> 09:46.851
Or are you trying
to scare me?

09:46.853 --> 09:50.722
Pack your pretty friends
and hopes of salvation

09:50.724 --> 09:52.857
And go back to scotland.

09:52.859 --> 09:56.261
And exactly how long before
England attacks in full force

09:56.263 --> 09:57.796
If I do that?

09:59.599 --> 10:01.232
I'm not going anywhere.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.735
Simon:
Didn't the nuns raise
a brave girl.

10:03.737 --> 10:07.272
Sent to them for
your protection, as I recall.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.107
How was the porridge
at convent?

10:09.109 --> 10:11.076
We thought it needed
a little seasoning.

10:11.078 --> 10:14.346
<i>A little something to make the</i>
<i>flavor of our intentions clear.</i>

10:15.881 --> 10:18.617
Darling, you're missing
the game.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.285
Antoine's had seven cups
of wine.

10:20.287 --> 10:23.288
Every time he hiccups or burps,
we must have one ourselves.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.123
Simon.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.291
Back at court?

10:26.293 --> 10:28.026
And very pleased
to be here.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.895
I have another game
in mind for you.

10:30.897 --> 10:32.631
Ah.

10:34.266 --> 10:36.034
What are you doing?

10:36.036 --> 10:37.769
Don't move. Don't push me away.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.137
You're shaking.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.905
You can't show them
you're scared.

10:40.907 --> 10:42.641
He threatened me
here at french court.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.242
He wanted me to know
that they tried

10:44.244 --> 10:45.977
To poison me at
the convent.

10:45.979 --> 10:49.781
He's heard things about
my reluctance to marry you.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.650
Then they're aware.

10:51.652 --> 10:53.284
That I don't have your
country's protection here.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.420
You do. You do.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.055
There are dozens
of english here,

10:57.057 --> 10:58.790
Hundreds more camped
on the coastline.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.659
I'm at your side.

11:00.661 --> 11:02.727
We'll prove to them
our union is strong.

11:02.729 --> 11:04.663
But it isn't.

11:04.665 --> 11:08.266
Well, they'll think it is
before their visit is over.

11:15.074 --> 11:17.042
Can you do this?

11:18.077 --> 11:20.078
Absolutely.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.880
Can you?

11:42.401 --> 11:43.902
As is the custom...

11:43.904 --> 11:45.370
(coughing)

11:45.372 --> 11:47.439
...The door of the prisoner
scheduled to be executed...

11:47.441 --> 11:48.973
Ugh!

11:48.975 --> 11:50.742
...Was marked with an "x."

11:50.744 --> 11:53.144
Yes. Go on, go on.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.780
In another cell,
a second boy, a thief,

11:55.782 --> 11:58.049
Was being detained
and punished.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.952
Tortured, you mean.

12:02.154 --> 12:04.055
Who is this?

12:04.057 --> 12:07.058
The boy whose cell
was mistakenly marked.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.328
It was colin
who was tortured

12:10.330 --> 12:11.796
And escaped.

12:11.798 --> 12:13.164
They beheaded
the wrong boy

12:13.166 --> 12:15.166
And let him go?

12:15.168 --> 12:16.735
I said he escaped.

12:16.737 --> 12:18.036
He had help.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.738
Someone released him
from his bonds.

12:19.740 --> 12:22.073
No. Colin knows what we've done.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.444
If he tells mary,
she could destroy us.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.013
Especially if your husband,
the king, believes his story.

12:29.015 --> 12:30.482
We have to find colin.

12:30.484 --> 12:32.984
Find him...

12:32.986 --> 12:35.153
And kill him.

12:40.025 --> 12:42.494
Colin's alive?
Alive and escaped,
I'm afraid.

12:42.496 --> 12:44.462
Catherine:
He had help.
Mary: Who?

12:44.464 --> 12:45.463
Perhaps the english.

12:45.465 --> 12:46.965
But the attack,

12:46.967 --> 12:48.266
The execution--

12:48.268 --> 12:49.868
It all took place
before they arrived.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.036
They're always here, my dear.

12:52.038 --> 12:55.073
Spies and treachery are
constant in our world.

12:55.075 --> 12:56.407
But you have our protection.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.109
The guards are out
looking for colin,

12:58.111 --> 13:00.044
And he will be found.

13:00.046 --> 13:02.347
There's a picnic
this afternoon

13:02.349 --> 13:04.382
For madeleine
and charles.

13:04.384 --> 13:07.018
The perimeter
will be guarded.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.354
Perhaps this is
a mixed blessing.

13:09.356 --> 13:11.422
And I'll have a chance to speak

13:11.424 --> 13:13.558
With colin
once he's found

13:13.560 --> 13:16.127
To learn how deep the plot
against my person runs.

13:16.129 --> 13:19.097
You said yourself,
colin was a mere pawn.

13:19.099 --> 13:22.267
The informants
who pointed at the english

13:22.269 --> 13:23.568
Fled, fearing
retribution.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.270
Have they?
Mmm.

13:25.272 --> 13:28.406
All I ask of you is that

13:28.408 --> 13:30.508
You bring him
back alive.

13:30.510 --> 13:33.878
I need answers,
and you did regret

13:33.880 --> 13:36.414
That he was executed so quickly,
not knowing my request.

13:36.416 --> 13:39.117
Colin is a dangerous fugitive.
I cannot... <i>We...</i>

13:39.119 --> 13:41.553
Cannot possibly
guarantee that he

13:41.555 --> 13:44.389
Won't attack the guards
and be harmed or killed.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.391
We can promise to try.

13:46.393 --> 13:49.561
Henry:
<i>I heard you were the first</i>
<i>to learn</i>

13:49.563 --> 13:51.529
Of colin's escape.

13:51.531 --> 13:54.299
You were seen last night in
the dungeon with nostradamus.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.167
Yes.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.036
I sent out the guards
right away.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.904
But you didn't tell me.

13:59.906 --> 14:02.473
I wouldn't want to disturb you
in your mistress's bed.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.175
Diane's at the
country house.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.845
So, by all means,
keep me informed.

14:06.847 --> 14:08.379
Day or night.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.615
Because I want to know
whatever that boy has to say.

14:27.166 --> 14:29.067
Look at all
the guards.

14:29.069 --> 14:32.036
As if colin would
ever willingly return.

He told lola he was forced

15:49.282 --> 15:51.349
And order
him executed.

15:51.351 --> 15:52.984
Those orders came
from my parents.

15:52.986 --> 15:54.385
When I spoke to your parents,

15:54.387 --> 15:56.220
Even your father
seemed suspicious.

15:56.222 --> 15:58.589
And my mother?

16:00.359 --> 16:02.627
Are you accusing
her of something?
No.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.963
I don't know.

16:06.031 --> 16:07.465
I just want to be sure

16:07.467 --> 16:09.968
That colin is returned alive.

16:09.970 --> 16:12.070
And your parents
said he would be.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.738
Then he <i>will</i> be.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.506
Or they'll make every effort.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.108
Can you be sure of that?

16:17.110 --> 16:18.576
You have the word

16:18.578 --> 16:20.244
Of the king and
queen of France.

16:20.246 --> 16:23.448
I had their word
that we would be married.

16:23.450 --> 16:26.150
I'm not sure
words mean anything here.

16:27.453 --> 16:30.722

Girl: Charles.
Madeleine: Charles.

16:35.195 --> 16:38.129
Charles!

16:44.470 --> 16:46.070
I'm not sure
who you fear--

16:46.072 --> 16:47.772
The english or the french court.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.774
The english have threatened me
for years,

16:49.776 --> 16:52.610
But colin is the only one
who knows

16:52.612 --> 16:54.746
Who, at french court,
wants me gone.

16:54.748 --> 16:56.614
And you think the word of
an accused traitor will matter?

16:56.616 --> 16:58.383
If the right people
believe him--

16:58.385 --> 17:00.284
And I think they might--
then yes.

17:00.286 --> 17:03.388
Bash:
All right, I'll go.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.525
Best way out of the dungeon
is the south keep.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.762
Guards will have
a head start, but...

17:10.764 --> 17:12.630
They're not hunters,
and they fear the woods.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.799
Why?
There is much to fear.

17:14.801 --> 17:16.801
Dark and dangerous times,
your grace.

17:18.137 --> 17:19.670
But your presence brings light.

17:23.675 --> 17:27.345
I know. I didn't tell anyone.
Don't worry.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.580
Charles?

17:29.582 --> 17:32.050
Charles, madeleine feels
like you're ignoring her.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.651
Who are you talking to?

17:33.653 --> 17:34.652
No one.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.521
Oh, is that quite so?

17:40.192 --> 17:43.194
All right, I was talking
to my friend.

17:43.196 --> 17:45.696
But she wants me to
play with her, too.

17:45.698 --> 17:48.066
She gets jealous.

17:48.068 --> 17:51.402
She says that when I'm older,
I won't even remember her.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.104
Don't go in there.

17:53.106 --> 17:54.839
<i>She</i> decides when you see her.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.674
Well, that doesn't sound
very friendly.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.176
But she knows things.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.677
Because she goes
where she wants,

17:59.679 --> 18:01.212
And she sees
everything,

18:01.214 --> 18:03.548
And she knows
people's secrets.

18:03.550 --> 18:07.452
This friend, who likes to hide--

18:07.454 --> 18:09.587
I think she visited me once.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.155
You're lucky, then.

18:11.157 --> 18:13.124
She doesn't like people.

18:13.126 --> 18:15.426
Most of the time, she
doesn't really speak.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.695
But I bribe her
with things she likes,

18:17.697 --> 18:20.264
Or play guessing
games with her

18:20.266 --> 18:22.200
To learn things.
This friend--

18:22.202 --> 18:23.468
Does she have a name?

18:23.470 --> 18:25.570
Clarissa.

18:25.572 --> 18:28.106
But don't say
I told you.

18:30.676 --> 18:33.678
Please don't
go in there.

18:35.180 --> 18:37.248
Clarissa?

19:06.145 --> 19:08.779
I'm-I'm sorry.
I don't know you.

19:10.382 --> 19:12.884
Is that my dress?

19:12.886 --> 19:15.853
Your grace, forgive me.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.455
It's so beautiful.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.457
The tailor gave it to me

19:19.459 --> 19:21.159
To return, and I... I thought...

19:21.161 --> 19:22.493
I should never...

19:22.495 --> 19:23.828
My skin is on fire.

19:24.796 --> 19:25.863
My skin is on fire!

19:25.865 --> 19:27.198
Is something wrong?
No!

19:27.200 --> 19:29.167
Stay back! (panting)

19:29.169 --> 19:30.168
It's poisoned.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.602
My skin is burning.

19:31.604 --> 19:32.603
(shrieks)

19:32.605 --> 19:33.771
It's burning!

19:33.773 --> 19:36.340
Guards, someone, help me!

19:36.342 --> 19:40.311
Somebody help me, please!
Guards!

19:50.923 --> 19:53.858
She was right there
on the floor.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.227
She was dying.
Where-where could she have gone?

19:56.229 --> 19:58.296
They took the evidence.
Whoever did this

19:58.298 --> 20:00.498
Failed in their attempt
on you. Go!

20:00.500 --> 20:01.966
Now! An assassin

20:01.968 --> 20:03.768
With a dying girl could
not have gone far. Go!

20:03.770 --> 20:05.703
Go!
She was right there.

20:05.705 --> 20:09.273
How could anyone have escaped
with her?

20:09.275 --> 20:11.709
The passageway.

20:12.844 --> 20:15.680
I don't know how
far it goes...

20:15.682 --> 20:17.615
Or where, but...

20:23.555 --> 20:25.256
Could they have
gone through here?

20:25.258 --> 20:27.558
Shh.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.261
No. No, they'd echo.
We'd hear them.

20:30.263 --> 20:32.830
These passages are all stone,
nothing in them,

20:32.832 --> 20:35.433
But I didn't know
one connected to this room.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.301
You know about them?

20:37.303 --> 20:38.970
This castle's been built
over centuries.

20:38.972 --> 20:41.606
The passageways-- they connect
the older parts to the new.

20:41.608 --> 20:44.475
They're mostly sealed
up now, dead-ends.

20:44.477 --> 20:46.444
I'll have the guards
check them anyway.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.512
Where were your guards
when you came in?

20:48.514 --> 20:50.514
Well, they-they...
They weren't here.

20:50.516 --> 20:53.284
I, uh... I saw the servant,

20:53.286 --> 20:56.387
And I thought...
I thought it was safe.

20:56.389 --> 20:57.688
They'll be dealt with.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.490
In the meantime,
that english envoy needs

20:59.492 --> 21:00.891
To be detained and questioned.

21:00.893 --> 21:02.526
Do that.

21:02.528 --> 21:05.863
By all means.

21:08.734 --> 21:10.001
Your grace.

21:10.003 --> 21:11.535
Had enough sun?

21:12.537 --> 21:14.472
Or are you blushing?

21:14.474 --> 21:16.007
Both.

21:16.009 --> 21:18.609
I wondered when I might find
a moment alone with you again,

21:18.611 --> 21:21.479
As I very much
enjoyed our last.

21:21.481 --> 21:22.813
Then I decided

21:22.815 --> 21:24.882
A public chat might
be the best way

21:24.884 --> 21:27.618
To protect
your reputation.

21:27.620 --> 21:31.322
Hmm. I didn't
know I, um...

anything to me?

21:36.995 --> 21:39.297
I can't stop

21:40.499 --> 21:42.366
I wish we hadn't
stopped, but...

21:42.368 --> 21:45.770
But I understand why.

21:45.772 --> 21:48.306
A maiden's virtue
is everything.

21:48.308 --> 21:50.908
I want a woman,
not a maiden.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.576
As king, I've learned
to be very clear

21:52.578 --> 21:53.778
About when to state my terms.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.581

of diplomacy,

Not under french law,
not in our home.

You can't prove
they did anything

22:09.395 --> 22:10.928

body is found.

You're not gonna do
anything, are you?
I didn't say that.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.008
You're just going
to keep her here,

22:24.010 --> 22:25.009
Like some acquisition,

22:25.011 --> 22:26.410
A weapon you might
never use.

22:26.412 --> 22:27.812
Alliances <i>are</i> weapons.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.113

End it. Let her go.

22:32.952 --> 22:35.086
Her life is
always at risk.

22:35.088 --> 22:37.121
She first came to us
when she was six

22:37.123 --> 22:38.856
Because the english
wanted to kill her.

22:38.858 --> 22:41.826
She's no safer here
than anywhere else.
Exactly.

22:41.828 --> 22:44.562
Where do you think she's going
to go, back to scotland?

22:44.564 --> 22:45.896
Her mother doesn't
want her back,

22:45.898 --> 22:47.765
Not without a king
for a husband.

22:47.767 --> 22:50.434
She's here doing her job,
and her job is waiting for me

To decide when you
should marry her.

22:51.971 --> 22:54.905
She...
She is not...
Going anywhere.

she's a girl,

She has no cause to.

35:03.635 --> 35:06.236
She knows that I won't wed you
unless it's right for France.

35:06.238 --> 35:10.240
I can't make sense of it,
either... But she did it.

35:10.242 --> 35:12.709
She was behind it all,

35:12.711 --> 35:15.545
I am sure of it.

35:15.547 --> 35:19.616
She terrorized me...
And it worked.

35:22.186 --> 35:24.521
If your conscience,
your politics

35:24.523 --> 35:26.723
Won't allow you
to marry me,

35:26.725 --> 35:30.127
Then the english feel that
they have a clean shot at me

35:30.129 --> 35:34.464
With the queen of France
as their weapon...

35:34.466 --> 35:36.266
And I can't stay here.

35:36.268 --> 35:39.870
Even my mother
will understand

35:39.872 --> 35:42.305
Because I can't bring
home any armies

35:42.307 --> 35:45.275
And I can't wed any
kings if I'm dead.

35:59.591 --> 36:02.459
You remember robert,
the viscount of lorraine.

36:02.461 --> 36:04.294
Yes?

36:04.296 --> 36:07.230
Robert, will you take
lady kenna as your bride,

36:07.232 --> 36:09.900
No questions asked,
because it's a union

36:09.902 --> 36:12.469
Blessed by your king?

36:12.471 --> 36:14.704
As you wish,
your majesty.

36:14.706 --> 36:15.906
Thanks, robert.

36:15.908 --> 36:17.774
That will be all.

36:24.348 --> 36:27.284
You needn't worry.

36:27.286 --> 36:29.886
Being in the king's favor
expands your prospects.

36:29.888 --> 36:32.455
It doesn't limit them.

36:49.907 --> 36:51.975
(gasping)

36:53.778 --> 36:56.780
Think about that, too.

36:58.816 --> 37:00.750
(sighs)

37:04.722 --> 37:07.591
I hope to be
a good king someday,

37:07.593 --> 37:09.659
Which is why I will
never put anything,

37:09.661 --> 37:12.696
Any love, ahead of the love
for my country.

37:14.365 --> 37:16.366
Why do you doubt that?

37:16.368 --> 37:17.867
What makes you think I do?

37:18.869 --> 37:20.937
You put a boy to death--

37:20.939 --> 37:22.939
Two boys--

37:22.941 --> 37:25.642
One with the sweep
of a paintbrush,

37:25.644 --> 37:30.413
A red "x" carelessly applied,
a life over,

37:30.415 --> 37:32.315
Another boy slain in the woods.

37:33.284 --> 37:35.285
Mistakes were made.

37:35.287 --> 37:39.422
We tried to bring colin back
even though he was a traitor.

37:39.424 --> 37:41.024
If he's a traitor,
then what are you?

37:41.026 --> 37:42.359
Who are you loyal to?

37:42.361 --> 37:45.362
My family, France,

37:45.364 --> 37:47.364
You, as they are
one and the same.

37:47.366 --> 37:48.698
Because you can't
trust father

37:48.700 --> 37:50.433
And he can't divorce you.

37:50.435 --> 37:52.636
I mean, you must wonder what
he'd do to you if he could,

37:52.638 --> 37:55.405
So you put all your hopes,
your survival

37:55.407 --> 37:58.508
On the favor
of the next king-- me--

37:58.510 --> 38:00.910
But, mother...
You must understand

38:00.912 --> 38:03.480
That my, my marriage
to mary, to anyone

38:03.482 --> 38:05.448
Won't change
my loyalty to you.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.317
Is the pull so strong?

38:07.319 --> 38:08.918
Yes.

38:08.920 --> 38:11.054
Yes, it is.

38:11.989 --> 38:13.623
But it doesn't matter.

38:13.625 --> 38:16.993
Mary came here
in good faith, and now...

38:16.995 --> 38:18.495
Well, now what?

38:18.497 --> 38:19.729
Is she leaving?

38:19.731 --> 38:22.599
("navigate" by band of skulls
playing)

38:22.601 --> 38:23.800
It   <i>wa</i>you.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.468
No.

38:25.470 --> 38:28.004
You need to stop this.

38:28.006 --> 38:30.774
If anything happens
to mary-- anything--

38:30.776 --> 38:33.743
I will suspect you
and I won't need proof...

38:33.745 --> 38:35.779
