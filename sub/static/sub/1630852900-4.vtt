THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK, WITH THE

WORLD'S ATTENTION STILL FOCUSED

01:06.933 --> 01:07.667

SO WE'RE GOING TO TURN OUR FOCUS

01:37.530 --> 01:39.232
TONIGHT TO THE U.S., WHERE IT'S

01:39.299 --> 01:39.833
BEEN A BLEAK FEW WEEKS FOR THE

01:39.899 --> 01:41.034
LGBTQ COMMUNITY.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.569
IN ADDITION TO GREG ABBOTT'S

01:42.635 --> 01:43.670

01:43.736 --> 01:45.638
THE PARENTS OF TRANSGENDER KIDS,

01:49.642 --> 01:51.110
AND THAT NUMBER'S CONTINUING TO

01:51.177 --> 01:52.145
GROW.

01:52.212 --> 01:53.446
THIS WEEK, THE FOCUS FELL ON

THE TWIN KYLE CHANDLER SHOULD

02:06.493 --> 02:07.327
IS ON THE SENATE FLOOR TODAY.

02:07.393 --> 02:07.961
>> DOES IT SAY THAT

02:08.027 --> 02:09.863

02:09.929 --> 02:11.764
DOES IT SAY THAT IN THE BILL?

02:11.831 --> 02:12.832
I'M ASKING YOU TO TELL ME

02:12.899 --> 02:13.633
WHAT'S IN THE BILL

02:13.700 --> 02:14.634
BECAUSE YOU ARE PUSHING FALSE

02:28.014 --> 02:28.982
>> FOR GRADES PRE-K THROUGH 3.

02:29.048 --> 02:29.883
AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE

02:29.949 --> 02:30.483
THAT PARENTS ARE ABLE

02:30.550 --> 02:31.117
TO SEND THEIR KID TO

02:31.184 --> 02:32.051

02:32.118 --> 02:32.719
SOME OF THIS STUFF INJECTED

02:32.785 --> 02:33.987

02:34.053 --> 02:37.257
>> John: WOW.

02:37.323 --> 02:38.424
I'M GOING TO SAY IT.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.259
THAT MAY BE THE ANGRIEST

02:39.325 --> 02:40.159
ANYONE'S EVER BEEN AT A

02:40.226 --> 02:40.894

02:40.960 --> 02:41.895
BUT SINCE HE'S CLAIMING "FALSE

02:41.961 --> 02:42.495
NARRATIVES" THERE, LET'S TALK

02:42.562 --> 02:43.029
ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL WOULD

02:43.096 --> 02:44.464
ACTUALLY DO.

02:44.531 --> 02:47.100
ITS SUPPORTERS CLAIM IT ONLY

02:47.166 --> 02:49.168
BANS INSTRUCTION, NOT

02:49.235 --> 02:50.136
DISCUSSION OF SEXUAL IDENTITY

02:50.203 --> 02:50.870
AND GENDER ORIENTATION.

02:50.937 --> 02:51.504
BUT THAT STILL LEAVES TEACHERS

02:51.571 --> 02:52.305
WONDERING WHERE TO DRAW THE

02:52.372 --> 02:53.072
LINE, AND HOW THEY'RE SUPPOSED

02:53.139 --> 02:55.742
TO HANDLE QUESTIONS ABOUT

02:55.808 --> 02:57.076
SAME-SEX PARENTS OR DRAWING A

02:57.143 --> 02:58.111
FAMILY TREE OR EVEN BASIC FACTS

02:58.177 --> 02:59.846
ABOUT THEIR OWN LIVES, AS THIS

02:59.913 --> 03:01.614
KINDERGARTEN TEACHER EXPLAINS.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.983
>> CORY SAYS TEACHERS

03:04.050 --> 03:05.385
AT HIS SCHOOL ARE ENCOURAGED

03:05.451 --> 03:06.352
TO DISPLAY THEIR FAMILIES,

03:06.419 --> 03:06.986
AS HE DOES OF HIS PARTNER,

03:07.053 --> 03:08.655
JEREMIAH.

03:08.721 --> 03:10.290
>> AM I GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO

03:10.356 --> 03:11.791
TELL THEM THIS IS MY PARTNER?

03:11.858 --> 03:12.859
WELL, WHAT IF THEY ASK ME?

03:12.926 --> 03:14.027
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

03:14.093 --> 03:14.861
AM I GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO HAVE

03:14.928 --> 03:19.065
THAT DISCUSSION WITH THEM?

03:19.132 --> 03:19.799
>> John: RIGHT!

03:19.866 --> 03:20.833
THAT'S GONNA BE AN ISSUE.

03:20.900 --> 03:21.434
BECAUSE KIDS ASK QUESTIONS ALL

03:21.501 --> 03:22.135
THE FUCKING TIME.

03:22.201 --> 03:23.770
LIKE, "WHERE DO BABIES COME

03:23.836 --> 03:25.071
FROM" AND "WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE

03:25.138 --> 03:26.573
DIE" AND "WHY CAN'T ANYONE ELSE

03:26.639 --> 03:28.207
SEE THE OLD LADY IN THE WINDOW?"

03:28.274 --> 03:34.914
THEY JUST WON'T STOP.

03:34.981 --> 03:37.984
THERE'S NOBODY THERE.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.586
ALSO, IT'S NOT JUST

03:39.652 --> 03:40.253
K THROUGH 3.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.020
THE BILL ALSO LIMITS

03:41.087 --> 03:41.888
ANY INSTRUCTION ON THESE

03:41.955 --> 03:42.522
ISSUES FOR GRADES FOUR AND ABOVE

03:42.589 --> 03:42.956
TO WHAT'S "AGE- OR

03:43.022 --> 03:43.756
DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE,"

03:43.823 --> 03:44.324
WITHOUT DEFINING WHAT THAT

03:44.390 --> 03:44.991
ACTUALLY MEANS.

03:45.058 --> 03:45.992
AND THE WORRY IS THAT TEACHERS

03:46.059 --> 03:46.726
WILL FEEL THEY HAVE TO STEER

03:46.793 --> 03:47.660
CLEAR OF THOSE TOPICS

03:47.727 --> 03:49.429
ALTOGETHER, ESPECIALLY AS THE

03:49.495 --> 03:50.763
BILL ALLOWS PARENTS THE RIGHT TO

03:50.830 --> 03:51.598
SUE IF THEY THINK THEIR CHILDREN

03:51.664 --> 03:52.231
HAVE RECEIVED INAPPROPRIATE

03:52.298 --> 03:52.966
LESSONS.

03:53.032 --> 03:54.534
AND WHILE YOU'LL HEAR IDIOTS

03:54.601 --> 03:55.668
SAYING THIS BILL IS TO PREVENT

03:55.735 --> 03:57.136
KINDERGARTENERS GETTING TAUGHT

03:57.203 --> 03:58.838
ABOUT SEX, WITH RON DESANTIS'S

03:58.905 --> 04:00.273
CAMPAIGN ARGUING IT'LL STOP

04:00.340 --> 04:01.808
R-RATED LESSONS ABOUT SEXUALITY,

04:01.874 --> 04:02.609
THE WORDING IS MUCH BROADER THAN

04:02.675 --> 04:04.844
THAT.

04:04.911 --> 04:10.083
AND WHEN ONE STATE SENATOR DID

04:10.149 --> 04:11.417
TRY TO NARROW IT AND AMEND THE

04:11.484 --> 04:11.851
BILL TO PERTAIN

04:11.918 --> 04:13.319
ONLY TO DISCUSSION ABOUT HUMAN

04:13.386 --> 04:19.225
SEXUALITY OR SEXUAL ACTIVITY,

04:19.292 --> 04:20.093
DENNIS BAXLEY, THE BILL'S

04:20.159 --> 04:21.160
SPONSOR, REJECTED THAT, SAYING

04:21.227 --> 04:21.761
IT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY GUT THE

04:21.828 --> 04:22.729
LEGISLATION.

04:22.795 --> 04:25.031
SO IT'S CLEAR WHAT HE THINKS THE

04:25.098 --> 04:26.499
GUTS OF THIS LEGISLATION ARE.

04:26.566 --> 04:28.434
IT'S NOT ABOUT SEX AT ALL, IT'S

04:28.501 --> 04:29.469
ABOUT DENYING THE EXISTENCE OF

04:29.535 --> 04:30.603
GAY PEOPLE.

04:30.670 --> 04:32.939
AND WHAT'S PARTICULARLY GALLING

04:33.006 --> 04:34.107
IS THE SUPPORT BAXLEY AND SOME

04:34.173 --> 04:35.541
OF THE REPUBLICAN LEGISLATORS

04:35.608 --> 04:38.344
WHO VOTED FOR THIS BILL HAVE HAD

04:38.411 --> 04:40.546
FROM CORPORATE AMERICA.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.281
AT&T OUR SOON TO BE EX-BUSINESS

04:42.348 --> 04:44.183
DADDY, HAS DONATED TO THEM.

04:44.250 --> 04:45.385
BUT ONE OF THE BIGGEST DONORS

04:45.451 --> 04:46.119
IS DISNEY.

04:46.185 --> 04:47.320
IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, IT'S

04:47.387 --> 04:49.222
GIVEN NEARLY $300,000 TO

04:49.288 --> 04:49.789
DESANTIS AND THE LEGISLATORS

04:49.856 --> 04:51.324
THAT VOTED FOR THIS BILL.

04:51.391 --> 04:52.325
NOW, ARE THEY MORALLY BANKRUPT

04:52.392 --> 04:53.159
FOR DOING THAT?

04:53.226 --> 04:56.229
WHO'S TO SAY?

04:56.295 --> 04:57.830
I'LL TELL YOU.

04:57.897 --> 04:59.032
I AM.

04:59.098 --> 04:59.866
I AM TO SAY.

04:59.932 --> 05:00.466
AFTER ALL, I'M ZAZU.

05:00.533 --> 05:00.967
OH, NOT THAT ONE,

05:01.034 --> 05:02.135
NOT THE FUN ONE.

05:02.201 --> 05:04.103
YEAH, THAT'S ME!

05:04.170 --> 05:04.837
THE FUSSY LITTLE DEAD-EYED BIRD

05:04.904 --> 05:10.009
WHO RUINS EVERYBODY'S DAY.

05:10.076 --> 05:11.110
THIS GUY.

05:11.177 --> 05:12.045
DISNEY EMPLOYEES WERE

05:12.111 --> 05:12.645
UNDERSTANDABLY OUTRAGED WHEN

05:12.712 --> 05:13.680
THIS CAME TO LIGHT, AND BOB

05:13.746 --> 05:14.547
CHAPEK, DISNEY'S CEO AND

05:14.614 --> 05:16.416
BUSINESS THUMB, THEN MADE THINGS

05:16.482 --> 05:17.150
WORSE, PUTTING OUT A STATEMENT

05:17.216 --> 05:18.851
DEFENDING DISNEY'S SILENCE ON

05:18.918 --> 05:21.654
THE BILL AND LISTING A BUNCH OF

05:21.721 --> 05:26.292
DISNEY PROJECTS LIKE THESE

05:26.359 --> 05:28.027
SAYING ALL OF OUR DIVERSE

05:28.094 --> 05:29.395
STORIES ARE OUR CORPORATE

05:29.462 --> 05:30.029
STATEMENTS, AND THEY ARE MORE

05:30.096 --> 05:31.497
POWERFUL THAN ANY

05:31.564 --> 05:32.832
TWEET OR LOBBYING EFFORT.

05:32.899 --> 05:33.499
AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY NONSENSE,

05:33.566 --> 05:34.934
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, ENCANTO IS

05:35.001 --> 05:36.135
ACTUALLY AN APT REFERENCE, GIVEN

05:36.202 --> 05:37.036
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN FLORIDA.

05:37.103 --> 05:38.805
BECAUSE ITS CATCHIEST SONG IS

05:38.871 --> 05:40.006
ABOUT EVERYONE REFUSES TO TALK

05:40.073 --> 05:42.575
ABOUT ONE MEMBER OF THEIR

05:42.642 --> 05:44.944
FAMILY, WHICH SOUNDS LIKE

05:45.011 --> 05:45.945
A LESSON PLAN DESIGNED BY

05:46.012 --> 05:46.779
RON DESANTIS SPECIFICALLY FOR

05:46.846 --> 05:48.414
THAT KINDERGARTEN TEACHER FROM

05:48.481 --> 05:49.449
EARLIER.

05:49.515 --> 05:50.316
AND HERE'S THE THING: GENERALLY,

05:50.383 --> 05:50.917
MOVIES CAN AFFECT HOW PEOPLE

05:50.983 --> 05:52.018
VIEW THE WORLD.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.152
BUT IS THIS REALLY A PATH YOU

05:53.219 --> 05:55.088
WANT TO GO DOWN, DISNEY?

05:55.154 --> 05:56.889
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE SAME COMPANY

05:56.956 --> 05:58.224
THAT'S CODED BASICALLY EVERY

05:58.291 --> 05:59.759
VILLAIN IN YOUR MOVIES AS GAY,

05:59.826 --> 06:01.728
STEREOTYPED MINORITIES TO A

06:01.794 --> 06:02.795
BREATHTAKING DEGREE, AND HAD

06:02.862 --> 06:04.297
SOMETHING CALLED A "WENCH

06:04.363 --> 06:06.466
AUCTION" IN PLACE AT DISNEYLAND

06:06.532 --> 06:08.468
UNTIL 2018.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.570
SO I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU'VE HAD

06:10.636 --> 06:12.772
A 100% NET POSITIVE EFFECT.

06:12.839 --> 06:13.973
SO CHAPEK'S STATEMENT DIDN'T GO

06:14.040 --> 06:16.676
OVER WELL.

06:16.743 --> 06:17.577
TWO DAYS LATER,

06:17.643 --> 06:18.811
ON A SHAREHOLDER CALL, HE TOOK

06:18.878 --> 06:19.345
ANOTHER SWING, EXPRESSING

06:19.412 --> 06:19.912
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL, AND

06:19.979 --> 06:20.613
SAYING THIS.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.415
>> WHEN WE DONATE MONEY TO

06:22.482 --> 06:25.284
DIFFERENT POLITICAL CANDIDATES,

06:25.351 --> 06:26.819
WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW THEY'RE

06:26.886 --> 06:28.221
GOING TO VOTE GOING FORWARD

06:28.287 --> 06:29.756
INTO THE FUTURE.

06:29.822 --> 06:31.023
>> John: THAT IS SUCH BULLSHIT,

06:31.090 --> 06:32.091
IT'S ACTIVELY INSULTING.

06:32.158 --> 06:33.826
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT HOW DONATING

06:33.893 --> 06:35.161
WORKS.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.462
WHEN YOU DONATE MONEY,

06:36.529 --> 06:37.597
YOU GENERALLY KNOW WHAT THE

06:37.663 --> 06:38.197
RECIPIENT IS GOING TO DO WITH

06:38.264 --> 06:39.031
IT.

06:39.098 --> 06:41.134
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE GIVE TO

06:41.200 --> 06:42.702
FEEDING AMERICA AND NOT FEEDING

06:42.769 --> 06:44.370
AMERICA OR MAYBE TAKE FOOD AWAY

06:44.437 --> 06:45.638
FROM AMERICA AND PUT IT IN A BIG

06:45.705 --> 06:48.241
HOLE, WHO REALLY KNOWS?

06:48.307 --> 06:50.042
AND DISNEY SHOULD ABSOLUTELY

06:50.109 --> 06:52.044
HAVE HAD A GOOD IDEA HOW DENNIS

06:52.111 --> 06:53.813
BAXLEY WOULD VOTE WHEN THEY GAVE

06:53.880 --> 06:55.047
HIM MONEY, GIVEN HE'S NOT BEEN

06:55.114 --> 06:55.681
SHY ABOUT SHARING HIS VIEWS ON A

06:55.748 --> 06:57.116
HOST OF TOPICS.

06:57.183 --> 06:58.417
HE ONCE SUGGESTED ABORTION IS

06:58.484 --> 07:00.319
CAUSING EUROPEANS TO BE REPLACED

07:00.386 --> 07:01.420
BY IMMIGRANTS AND IS PAVING THE

07:01.487 --> 07:04.056
WAY FOR THE END OF WESTERN

07:04.123 --> 07:04.991
CIVILIZATION, AND AS RECENTLY AS

07:05.057 --> 07:06.359
2020, HE JOINED OTHERS IN FILING

07:06.425 --> 07:09.796
BILLS TO REPEAL PROTECTIONS FOR

07:09.862 --> 07:10.630
LGBTQ WORKERS AND LEGALIZE GAY

07:10.696 --> 07:13.032
CONVERSION THERAPY.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.500
AND HE ALSO ONCE SAID THIS.

07:14.567 --> 07:17.870
>> I KNOW SOME DISTRICTS

07:17.937 --> 07:21.407
WHERE THERE'S A BIG INFESTATION

07:21.474 --> 07:24.577
OF HOMOSEXUALS THAT ARE PUSHING

07:24.644 --> 07:25.545
THEIR AGENDA UNDER THE SCREEN

07:25.611 --> 07:28.080
AND THEY TRY AND GET MORE PEOPLE

07:28.147 --> 07:30.283
HIRED THAT ARE LIKE THEM,

07:30.349 --> 07:32.018
AND SET UP GAY ADOPTIONS,

07:32.084 --> 07:34.520
AND ALL THIS STUFF, SO IT'S A

07:34.587 --> 07:36.756
CONTINUAL FIGHT FOR THE VALUES

07:36.823 --> 07:40.660
THAT WE HOLD DEAR.

07:40.726 --> 07:42.295
>> John: OKAY, SO THERE'S A LOT

07:42.361 --> 07:43.863
TO UNPACK THERE,

07:43.930 --> 07:44.764
FROM THE DECOR WHICH SCREAMS

07:44.831 --> 07:45.231
"CHRISTMAS IN HOSPICE"

07:45.298 --> 07:45.898
TO THE DISGUSTING USE

07:45.965 --> 07:46.532
OF THE WORD "INFESTATION" TO THE

07:46.599 --> 07:47.400
FACT HE'S TALKING ABOUT STOPPING

07:47.466 --> 07:48.601
GAY ADOPTION IN FRONT OF A

07:48.668 --> 07:50.002
RONALD REAGAN QUOTE THAT SAYS

07:50.069 --> 07:51.871
"MAN IS NOT FREE UNLESS

07:51.938 --> 07:52.905
GOVERNMENT IS LIMITED."

07:52.972 --> 07:55.141
AN IRONY COMPLETELY LOST ON

07:55.208 --> 07:57.043
DENNIS.

07:57.109 --> 07:58.344
CHAPEK THEN TOOK A THIRD SWING

07:58.411 --> 07:59.979
AT AN APOLOGY ON FRIDAY, SAYING

08:00.046 --> 08:00.847
DISNEY WAS PAUSING ALL ITS

08:00.913 --> 08:01.714
POLITICAL GIVING IN FLORIDA,

08:01.781 --> 08:03.883
PENDING A REVIEW, AND PROMISING,

08:03.950 --> 08:06.252
"I AM AN ALLY YOU CAN COUNT ON,"

08:06.319 --> 08:06.853
FOR WHICH THE JURY IS VERY

08:06.919 --> 08:08.387
MUCH OUT.

08:08.454 --> 08:10.756
BUT WHEN THIS BILL PASSES --

08:10.823 --> 08:11.891
AS SEEMS INEVITABLE --

08:11.958 --> 08:13.893
THE HARM WILL HAVE BEEN DONE.

08:13.960 --> 08:17.864
THAT KINDERGARTEN TEACHER

08:17.930 --> 08:20.867
WHO'S WEARING A FUCKING MICKEY

08:20.933 --> 08:21.667
MOUSE T-SHIRT IN THAT PHOTO WITH

08:21.734 --> 08:22.568
HIS PARTNER WILL HAVE BEEN

08:22.635 --> 08:23.669
BETRAYED BY A COMPANY WHOSE WORK

08:23.736 --> 08:24.503
HE LOVES.

08:24.570 --> 08:25.104
AND FOR ALL CHAPEK'S

08:25.171 --> 08:26.072
SELF-CONGRATULATION ABOUT HOW

08:26.138 --> 08:27.273
DISNEY MOVIES LIKE BLACK PANTHER

08:27.340 --> 08:28.507
CAN INSTIGATE CHANGE, THAT

08:28.574 --> 08:29.742
CHANGE CLEARLY HAS ITS LIMITS,

08:29.809 --> 08:31.944
GIVEN THAT JUST THIS WEEK, NEWS

08:32.011 --> 08:33.112
BROKE THAT THE MOVIE'S DIRECTOR,

08:33.179 --> 08:33.913
RYAN COOGLER, HAD BEEN

08:33.980 --> 08:34.780
HANDCUFFED BY POLICE WHILE

08:34.847 --> 08:35.882
TRYING TO WITHDRAW MONEY FROM

08:35.948 --> 08:37.850
HIS OWN BANK ACCOUNT.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.585
MARGINALIZED CREATORS HAVE MADE

08:39.652 --> 08:41.287
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR DISNEY.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.190
NOW, SHOULD IT EMBARRASS THEM

08:44.257 --> 08:44.757
THAT IT TOOK THEM UNTIL THIS

08:44.824 --> 08:46.225
WEEK TO REALIZE THEY SHOULDN'T

08:46.292 --> 08:46.826
TAKE THAT MONEY AND ACTIVELY

08:46.893 --> 08:47.827
UNDERMINE THOSE CREATORS'

08:47.894 --> 08:48.995
INTERESTS?

08:49.061 --> 08:52.331
WHO'S TO SAY?

08:52.398 --> 08:53.165
I'LL TELL YOU.

08:53.232 --> 08:53.900
I AM.

08:53.966 --> 08:55.268
I'M ZAZU, REMEMBER.

08:55.334 --> 08:56.802
AND WHILE I HAVEN'T BEEN INVITED

08:56.869 --> 08:57.904
BACK FOR THE PREQUEL YET, AFTER

08:57.970 --> 08:58.537
TONIGHT, I'VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD

08:58.604 --> 09:00.406
FEELING ABOUT IT.

09:00.473 --> 09:03.743
AND NOW THIS.

09:03.809 --> 09:08.948
>> AND NOW JIM CRAMER PRESENTS

09:09.015 --> 09:09.448
GROUNDS FOR DIVORCE.

09:09.515 --> 09:11.651
>> LET'S START WITH WENDY'S.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.185
I LIKE WENDY'S.

09:13.252 --> 09:14.787
NOT JUST BECAUSE MY WIFE CAN PUT

09:14.854 --> 09:16.555
AWAY A DOUBLE BACONATOR QUICKER

09:16.622 --> 09:17.356
THAN ANYONE.

09:17.423 --> 09:19.392
THEY HAVE HIGHLIGHTED MY WIFE

09:19.458 --> 09:20.826
EATING A JUICY BACONATOR ALL

09:20.893 --> 09:22.061
OVER HER CAR.

09:22.128 --> 09:24.030
MY WIFE IS CRAZY ABOUT IT.

09:24.096 --> 09:26.232
SHE DOESN'T CARE.

09:26.299 --> 09:28.634
MY WIFE HAD A BACONATOR.

09:28.701 --> 09:29.669
HOLY COW.

09:29.735 --> 09:31.437
THAT'S TOUGH TO WORK OFF.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.372
MY WIFE HAD A BACONATOR DURING

09:33.439 --> 09:35.241
VACATION WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY A

09:35.308 --> 09:37.209
BULK UP SITUATION.

09:37.276 --> 09:38.044
MY WIFE CHAMPIONED THAT

09:38.110 --> 09:40.613
BACONATOR PRETTY GOT TO GO TO

09:40.680 --> 09:41.180
PLANET FITNESS RIGHT AFTER.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.249
MY WIFE IS A WENDY'S PERSON.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.684
SHE LIKES THE BACONATOR.

09:44.750 --> 09:45.851
SHE LOVES THE BACONATOR.

09:45.918 --> 09:48.054
>> I KNOW YOUR WIFE LIKES THAT

09:48.120 --> 09:49.922
BACONATOR ON A REGULAR BASIS.

09:49.989 --> 09:50.790
>> SHE LOVES THE BACONATOR.

09:50.856 --> 09:52.458
I DID IT TO STOP MY WIFE

09:52.525 --> 09:53.793
YESTERDAY FROM GETTING A

09:53.859 --> 09:54.360
BACONATOR.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.629
I SAID ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!

09:56.696 --> 09:57.830
INCLUDING IN THE MID SINGLE

09:57.897 --> 09:59.799
DIGITS AND THAT WAS BECAUSE MY

09:59.865 --> 10:01.100
WIFE LIKED THE BACONATOR.

10:01.167 --> 10:03.002
SHE LIKES THE DOUBLE CHEESE

10:03.069 --> 10:03.936
BACONATOR.

10:04.003 --> 10:06.205
ONCE AGAIN, HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO

10:06.272 --> 10:09.508
LISA.

10:09.575 --> 10:10.910
>> John: MOVING ON.

10:10.977 --> 10:12.311
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

10:12.378 --> 10:13.512
LIVE ENTERTAINMENT.

10:13.579 --> 10:15.014
IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE

10:15.081 --> 10:16.048
MISSED MOST DURING THE PANDEMIC,

10:16.115 --> 10:16.816
AND EVERYONE WAS VERY EXCITED TO

10:16.882 --> 10:19.151
SEE IT START TO COME BACK.

10:19.218 --> 10:20.619
>> IT'S BEEN MORE THAN A YEAR

10:20.686 --> 10:21.721
WITHOUT THEM, BUT NOW HAMPTON

10:21.787 --> 10:22.288
COLOSSEUM IS BRINGING BACK

10:22.355 --> 10:23.322
CONCERTS.

10:23.389 --> 10:23.923
>> I'M PUMPED.

10:23.990 --> 10:24.590
I'M READY TO GO.

10:24.657 --> 10:25.391
I'M VACCINATED.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.427
I'M READY TO GO.

10:28.494 --> 10:29.428
I'VE BEEN LOCKED UP FOR A

10:29.495 --> 10:30.229
YEAR AND TEN MONTHS AND NOW I'M

10:30.296 --> 10:31.263
GONNA LET LOOSE AND DESTROY THIS

10:31.330 --> 10:32.264
PLACE.

10:32.331 --> 10:33.699
>> John: YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:33.766 --> 10:35.134
LET HIM HAVE IT.

10:35.201 --> 10:35.968
EVERYONE MISSED THEIR COMFORTS

10:36.035 --> 10:37.003
DURING THE PANDEMIC.

10:37.069 --> 10:37.837
FOR INSTANCE, I CAN GUARANTEE

10:37.903 --> 10:39.839
THE SENTENCE "I'VE BEEN LOCKED

10:39.905 --> 10:40.673
UP FOR A YEAR AND TEN MONTHS AND

10:40.740 --> 10:42.708
NOW I'M HERE TO DESTROY THIS

10:42.775 --> 10:43.776
PLACE" WAS ALSO SAID SEVERAL

10:43.843 --> 10:45.611
TIMES AT THE RE-OPENING OF

10:45.678 --> 10:46.545
AN ANN TAYLOR LOFT.

10:46.612 --> 10:48.881
EVERYONE'S BEEN A BIT EDGY.

10:48.948 --> 10:51.884
LIVE ENTERTAINMENT UNDENIABLY

10:51.951 --> 10:52.952
OFFERS UNIQUE EXPERIENCES FROM

10:53.019 --> 10:53.919
TAYLOR SWIFT UNVEILING HER

10:53.986 --> 10:55.054
SQUAD, TO A HOLOGRAM TUPAC

10:55.121 --> 10:56.822
PERFORMING AT COACHELLA, TO THIS

10:56.889 --> 10:57.490
UNSURPASSED MOMENT FROM A JUSTIN

10:57.556 --> 11:04.130
BIEBER CONCERT.

11:04.196 --> 11:07.133
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

11:07.199 --> 11:10.436
GOOD.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.270
GOOD.

11:11.337 --> 11:12.405
I'M GLAD THAT HAPPENED.

11:12.471 --> 11:13.406
AND WHILE IT'S AMAZING TO WATCH

11:13.472 --> 11:14.673
THAT TOGETHER NOW, JUST IMAGINE

11:14.740 --> 11:15.274
BEING THERE TO SEE IT LIVE IN

11:15.341 --> 11:16.709
PERSON.

11:16.776 --> 11:17.543
BUT IF YOU'VE BOUGHT OR EVEN

11:17.610 --> 11:19.645
TRIED TO BUY TICKETS RECENTLY,

11:19.712 --> 11:20.379
YOU KNOW THOSE EXPERIENCES COME

11:20.446 --> 11:21.313
AT A COST.

11:21.380 --> 11:22.348
>> I JUST SPENT THE

11:22.415 --> 11:23.416
LAST HOUR AND 15 MINUTES

11:23.482 --> 11:25.051
TRYING TO GET PINK TICKETS.

11:25.117 --> 11:26.352
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE BEHIND

11:26.419 --> 11:28.220
THE STAGE, YOU'RE LOOKING

11:28.287 --> 11:31.424
AT $500 PER TICKET.

11:31.490 --> 11:33.092
WHO CAN AFFORD THAT?

11:33.159 --> 11:35.461
>> FOR THE AMOUNT THAT I'M

11:35.528 --> 11:37.329
PAYING TO SEE ANY RANDOM BAND

11:37.396 --> 11:38.464
THAT'S GOING ON TOUR,

11:38.531 --> 11:39.765
THEY BETTER BE FUCKING

11:39.832 --> 11:40.733
SERENADING ME.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.234
>> WHY ARE BAD BUNNY

11:42.301 --> 11:45.738
TICKETS SO DAMN EXPENSIVE?

11:45.805 --> 11:47.706
Y'ALL MAKING ME WANT TO SELL MY

11:47.773 --> 11:50.109
HUSBAND'S FEET ON ONLYFANS!

11:50.176 --> 11:51.944
>> John: WOW.

11:52.011 --> 11:52.978
THAT IS A STRIKING SENTIMENT.

11:53.045 --> 11:54.146
ACTUALLY HOLD ON.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.549
HOLD ON.

11:56.615 --> 11:59.051
FOR SALE?

11:59.118 --> 12:02.321
HUSBAND FEET.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.622
ONLYFANS.

12:03.689 --> 12:05.791
WE DID IT!

12:05.858 --> 12:06.725
WE CREATED A SADDER STORY

12:06.792 --> 12:07.193
IN "FIVE" WORDS.

12:07.259 --> 12:08.194
SUCK IT, HEMINGWAY!

12:08.260 --> 12:08.494
SUCK IT!

12:08.561 --> 12:09.095
IF YOU THINK TICKETS HAVE BEEN

12:09.161 --> 12:09.762
GETTING RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE,

12:09.829 --> 12:10.029
THEY HAVE.

12:10.096 --> 12:10.429
THE AVERAGE PRICE

12:10.496 --> 12:11.063
FOR A POPULAR CONCERT HAS MORE

12:11.130 --> 12:12.064
THAN TRIPLED SINCE THE MID-'90s,

12:12.131 --> 12:13.199
VASTLY OUTPACING INFLATION.

12:13.265 --> 12:14.733
AND THAT'S BEFORE THEY HIT THE

12:14.800 --> 12:16.068
RESALE MARKET.

12:16.135 --> 12:17.036
AND WITH HUGE ARTISTS STARTING

12:17.103 --> 12:18.604
TO PUT TICKETS ON SALE FOR

12:18.671 --> 12:19.872
SUMMER SHOWS, THAT IRRITATION IS

12:19.939 --> 12:21.941
ONLY LIKELY TO INCREASE.

12:22.007 --> 12:23.542
SO TONIGHT, WE THOUGHT WE'D TRY

12:23.609 --> 12:24.810
AND EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHY BAD

12:24.877 --> 12:26.779
BUNNY TICKETS ARE SO EXPENSIVE,

12:26.846 --> 12:29.682
WHO'S MAKING MONEY OFF THEM, AND

12:29.748 --> 12:30.249
WHAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO

12:30.316 --> 12:30.916
ABOUT IT THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE

12:30.983 --> 12:31.951
SELLING YOUR HUSBAND'S FEET.

12:32.017 --> 12:33.352
AND LET'S START WITH THE COMPANY

12:33.419 --> 12:34.520
THAT YOU'RE IMMEDIATELY THINKING

12:34.587 --> 12:36.622
OF: TICKETMASTER.

12:36.689 --> 12:37.857
THEY'RE THE BIGGEST PLAYER IN

12:37.923 --> 12:39.859
THE TICKET MARKET, BY FAR, AND

12:39.925 --> 12:41.861
CLAIM THEY STRIVE TO PUT FANS

12:41.927 --> 12:43.529
FIRST, AND THAT "THE PEOPLE WE

12:43.596 --> 12:45.698
CARE MOST ABOUT ARE THE FANS."

12:45.764 --> 12:46.932
AND YET, AS ANYONE WHO'S EVER

12:46.999 --> 12:49.235
BOUGHT A TICKET FROM THEM KNOWS,

12:49.301 --> 12:50.002
THAT'S GENERALLY NOT THE FEELING

12:50.069 --> 12:51.904
YOU GET WHEN DEALING WITH THEM,

12:51.971 --> 12:53.405
AS THIS YOUTUBER EXPLAINS.

12:53.472 --> 12:55.341
>> IF THERE WAS ANYTHING THAT I

12:55.407 --> 12:57.743
HAD AS A WISH, FOR ANY BIG

12:57.810 --> 12:59.178
ARTIST OR BAND THAT COMES

12:59.245 --> 13:00.913
THROUGH, WHETHER IT'S K-POP,

13:00.980 --> 13:01.914
WHETHER IT'S A WESTERN ARTIST,

13:01.981 --> 13:03.816
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT IF YOU'RE

13:03.883 --> 13:05.451
A MAGICIAN -- ANY BIG TICKET

13:05.518 --> 13:09.155
PERSON THAT EVER COMES THROUGH,

13:09.221 --> 13:10.055
AND DOES A CONCERT --

13:10.122 --> 13:10.823
NEVER USE TICKETMASTER.

13:10.890 --> 13:12.858
USE LITERALLY ANYONE ELSE.

13:12.925 --> 13:13.726
THEY ARE TERRIBLE.

13:13.792 --> 13:15.027
>> John: OKAY, FIRST.

13:15.094 --> 13:15.961
EXCELLENT SHADE THROWN AT

13:16.028 --> 13:22.201
MAGICIANS.

13:22.268 --> 13:30.709
NOTED AND APPRECIATED.

13:30.776 --> 13:32.478
TICKETMASTER IS ONE OF THE MOST

13:32.545 --> 13:36.982
HATED.

13:37.049 --> 13:37.783
WE'VE GOT A FEW WEEKS

13:37.850 --> 13:38.684
TILL THE MERGER GOES THROUGH.

13:38.751 --> 13:39.185
IT'S GONNA BE A BUMPY RIDE

13:39.251 --> 13:39.618
TILL THEN.

13:39.685 --> 13:40.319
AND ALSO AFTER.

13:40.386 --> 13:41.053
AND LOOK, IT'S NO SECRET

13:41.120 --> 13:42.087
TICKETMASTER IS HORRIBLE.

13:42.154 --> 13:43.455
BUT EXACTLY HOW IT'S HORRIBLE IS

13:43.522 --> 13:44.590
GENUINELY INTERESTING.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.758
AND LET'S START WITH ONE OF THE

13:45.824 --> 13:46.926
THINGS THAT INFURIATES PEOPLE

13:46.992 --> 13:48.661
MOST ABOUT THEM: THE FEES.

13:48.727 --> 13:49.428
THEY CAN COME AS A NASTY

13:49.495 --> 13:51.697
SURPRISE AT THE VERY END OF A

13:51.764 --> 13:54.133
TRANSACTION AND CAN RANGE FROM

13:54.200 --> 13:56.535
THE ANNOYING TO THE

13:56.602 --> 13:57.169
COMPLETELY BATSHIT.

13:57.236 --> 13:57.736
WE FOUND A TICKET TO A 2019

13:57.803 --> 13:58.504
KIDZ BOP CONCERT WITH FEES THAT

13:58.571 --> 14:01.607

14:15.221 --> 14:18.991
TICKETS AT A MONSTER TRUCK

14:19.058 --> 14:19.725
RALLY $16.41.

14:19.792 --> 14:20.359
MORE THAN THE COST OF THE TICKET

14:20.426 --> 14:21.594
ITSELF!

14:21.660 --> 14:22.261
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, IN THE CASE

14:22.328 --> 14:22.861
OF THAT KIDZ BOP TOUR, IT

14:22.928 --> 14:23.762
MIGHT'VE BEEN WORTH IT, BECAUSE

SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM.

15:18.817 --> 15:19.752
SAYING THEY SHARE IN A PORTION

OF THE FEES WE COLLECT WHICH IS

15:22.521 --> 15:23.589
TRUE.

15:23.656 --> 15:24.123
TICKETMASTER ENTERS INTO

15:24.189 --> 15:24.690
CONTRACTS THAT SET AND SHARE

15:24.757 --> 15:25.257
FEES WITH THE VENUES WHERE

15:25.324 --> 15:25.891
CONCERTS ARE HELD, THE PROMOTERS

15:25.958 --> 15:26.525
WHO BOOK, MARKET, AND ORGANIZE

15:26.592 --> 15:27.126
THE SHOWS, AND SOMETIMES EVEN

15:27.192 --> 15:28.894
THE ARTISTS THEMSELVES.

15:28.961 --> 15:31.230
YOU COULD SAY TICKETMASTER'S

15:31.297 --> 15:34.066
BUSINESS MODEL IS TO STAND IN AS

15:34.133 --> 15:34.867
THE BAD GUY AND LET ALL THOSE

15:34.933 --> 15:37.169
OTHER PLAYERS HIDE BEHIND THEM.

15:37.236 --> 15:37.736
OR YOU COULD NOT SAY IT, AND

15:37.803 --> 15:40.673
JUST LET TICKETMASTER'S FORMER

15:40.739 --> 15:41.807
CEO BASICALLY ADMIT IT DIRECTLY

15:41.874 --> 15:42.808
TO CONGRESS.

15:42.875 --> 15:43.442
>> WHEN PEOPLE HEAR WHAT

15:43.509 --> 15:44.143
TICKETMASTER'S SERVICE CHARGE

15:44.209 --> 15:45.411
IS, YOU KNOW, TICKETMASTER

15:45.477 --> 15:46.145
WAS SET UP AS A SYSTEM

15:46.211 --> 15:47.913
WHERE THEY TOOK THE HEAT FOR

15:47.980 --> 15:48.180
EVERYBODY.

15:48.247 --> 15:48.747
IN THAT SERVICE CHARGE

15:48.814 --> 15:49.948
ARE THE CREDIT CARD FEES,

15:50.015 --> 15:51.617
THE REBATES TO THE BUILDINGS,

15:51.684 --> 15:53.452
REBATES SOMETIMES TO ARTISTS,

15:53.519 --> 15:55.254
SOMETIMES REBATES TO PROMOTERS.

15:55.321 --> 15:56.622
SO TICKETMASTER HAS BEEN THE --

15:56.689 --> 15:57.089
WE ARE LIKE THE IRS.

15:57.156 --> 15:58.991
WE DELIVER BAD NEWS.

15:59.058 --> 16:00.459
>> John: YEAH, IT'S TRUE.

16:00.526 --> 16:01.226
TICKETMASTER'S

16:01.293 --> 16:03.429
VERY LIKE THE IRS IN THAT ITS

16:03.495 --> 16:03.996
AN OPAQUE BUREAUCRACY, TAKES

16:04.063 --> 16:04.596
MORE OUT OF YOUR PAYCHECK THAN

16:04.663 --> 16:05.998
YOU THINK IT SHOULD, AND IS

16:06.065 --> 16:07.599
REPRESENTED BY MEN SO

16:07.666 --> 16:08.701
CATASTROPHICALLY UNCHARISMATIC

16:08.767 --> 16:09.601
THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE PUTTING

16:09.668 --> 16:10.969
THEMSELVES TO SLEEP.

16:11.036 --> 16:12.738
ALTHOUGH IT'S WORTH KNOWING

16:12.805 --> 16:14.106
THAT WHILE TICKETMASTER DOES

16:14.173 --> 16:16.175
SHARE FEES WITH OTHER PARTIES,

16:16.241 --> 16:17.576
SOME OF THOSE OTHER PARTIES MAY

16:17.643 --> 16:19.778
ALSO BE TICKETMASTER.

16:19.845 --> 16:22.781
BECAUSE JUST ONE YEAR AFTER THAT

16:22.848 --> 16:23.882
HEARING, THEY COMPLETED A

16:23.949 --> 16:24.817
GIGANTIC MERGER WITH LIVENATION,

16:24.883 --> 16:25.718
WHICH OWNS OR OPERATES MANY OF

16:25.784 --> 16:27.453
THE COUNTRY'S TOP MUSIC VENUES,

16:27.519 --> 16:28.420
AND CALL THEMSELVES, THE LARGEST

16:28.487 --> 16:30.055
PRODUCER OF LIVE MUSIC CONCERTS

16:30.122 --> 16:31.990
IN THE WORLD, AND SINCE THEN,

16:32.057 --> 16:33.058
THEY'VE HAD SOMETHING OF A

16:33.125 --> 16:34.626
CHOKEHOLD ON LIVE ENTERTAINMENT.

16:34.693 --> 16:36.595
IN FACT, THE DOJ RECENTLY

16:36.662 --> 16:37.529
ALLEGED THE COMPANY HAD

16:37.596 --> 16:40.866
REPEATEDLY STRONG-ARMED VENUES

16:40.933 --> 16:41.767
INTO USING TICKETMASTER AND

16:41.834 --> 16:43.035
RETALIATED AGAINST OR THREATENED

16:43.102 --> 16:43.602
VENUES THAT DID NOT USE ITS

16:43.669 --> 16:44.403
SERVICES.

16:44.470 --> 16:45.971
AND WHILE LIVENATION DENIES

16:46.038 --> 16:47.005
THAT, THERE'S NO DENYING JUST

16:47.072 --> 16:49.441
HOW MUCH POWER IT HAS.

16:49.508 --> 16:51.443
EVEN BEFORE THE MERGER, PEARL

16:51.510 --> 16:52.745
JAM, AT THE HEIGHT OF THEIR

16:52.811 --> 16:55.314
FAME, TRIED TO DO A TOUR WITHOUT

16:55.381 --> 16:56.281
TICKETMASTER OR THEIR

16:56.348 --> 16:57.383
AFFILIATED VENUES, BUT THEIR

16:57.449 --> 16:58.717
MANAGER ADMITTED AT THE TIME

16:58.784 --> 17:00.285
THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE TO PLAY

17:00.352 --> 17:00.953
AT WEIRD PLACES LIKE A SKI

17:01.019 --> 17:01.887
RESORT IN LAKE TAHOE AND A

17:01.954 --> 17:04.056
FAIRGROUND IN SAN DIEGO.

17:04.123 --> 17:06.392
AND IF PEARL JAM IN THE NINETIES

17:06.458 --> 17:07.793
DOESN'T HAVE THE POWER TO WALK

17:07.860 --> 17:08.861
AWAY FROM TICKETMASTER, NO ONE

17:08.927 --> 17:11.263
DOES.

17:11.330 --> 17:12.698
SO WHEN YOU WONDER,

17:12.765 --> 17:13.699
UNDERSTANDABLY, "WHY CAN'T MY

17:13.766 --> 17:16.001
FAVORITE ARTIST OR, INDEED,

17:16.068 --> 17:16.668
MAGICIAN JUST USE ANOTHER

17:16.735 --> 17:18.670
TICKETING COMPANY?"

17:18.737 --> 17:21.240
THE TRUTH IS, IF THEY WANT TO

17:21.306 --> 17:21.840
PERFORM AT A VENUE THAT HAS AN

17:21.907 --> 17:22.341
EXCLUSIVE CONTRACT WITH

17:22.408 --> 17:22.841
TICKETMASTER, THEY CAN'T

17:22.908 --> 17:25.344
ACTUALLY DO THAT.

17:25.411 --> 17:27.579
BUT FEES AREN'T THE ONLY

17:27.646 --> 17:28.847
COMPLAINT PEOPLE HAVE WITH THE

17:28.914 --> 17:30.249
TICKETBUYING PROCESS.

17:30.315 --> 17:31.383
ANOTHER IS TICKETS DISAPPEARING

17:31.450 --> 17:32.017
BEFORE YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO BUY

17:32.084 --> 17:33.452
THEM.

17:33.519 --> 17:34.953
CONCERTS FOR MAJOR ARTISTS CAN

17:35.020 --> 17:36.555
SELL OUT SO FAST, SOMETIMES,

17:36.622 --> 17:38.257
THEY EVEN MAKE THE NEWS.

17:38.323 --> 17:39.558
>> YOU KNOW YOU'RE HOT WHEN YOU

17:39.625 --> 17:40.459
CAN SELL OUT MADISON SQUARE

17:40.526 --> 17:41.727
GARDEN --

17:41.794 --> 17:45.764
20,000 SEATS, 30 SECONDS.

17:45.831 --> 17:46.365
THAT'S WHAT JUSTIN BIEBER DID!

17:46.432 --> 17:48.066
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO

17:48.133 --> 17:49.501
SHOWS AT THE GARDEN, WHICH SEATS

17:49.568 --> 17:50.536
AROUND 20,000 PEOPLE, SELLING

17:50.602 --> 17:52.004
OUT IN LESS TIME THAN IT TAKES

17:52.070 --> 17:52.871
ME TO APPLY MY LIP GLOSS.

17:52.938 --> 17:55.340
THAT'S CRAZY.

17:55.407 --> 17:56.542
>> John: YEAH, THAT IS CRAZY.

17:56.608 --> 17:57.509
NOT JUST BIEBER SELLING OUT

17:57.576 --> 17:59.445
20,000 SEATS IN 30 SECONDS, BUT

17:59.511 --> 18:02.314
ALSO THAT SHE PUTS LIP GLOSS ON

18:02.381 --> 18:03.148
FOR OVER 30 SECONDS.

18:03.215 --> 18:04.550
THAT'S JUST WAY TOO MUCH TIME.

18:04.616 --> 18:05.484
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW YOU DO IT.

18:05.551 --> 18:06.018
PUT A TIMER ON THE SCREEN

18:06.084 --> 18:07.453
RIGHT NOW.

18:07.519 --> 18:12.458
CHECK THIS SHIT OUT.

18:12.524 --> 18:13.192
STOP THE CLOCK.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.259
LOOK AT THAT!

18:14.326 --> 18:15.794
NOT EVEN CLOSE TO 30

18:15.861 --> 18:18.197
SECONDS, I DIDN'T BREAK A SWEAT,

18:18.263 --> 18:21.133
AND I LOOK FUCKING GREAT.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.835
BUT HERE'S THE THING.

18:22.901 --> 18:24.570
SELLING 20,000 SEATS IN 30

18:24.636 --> 18:25.504
SECONDS WOULD BE CRAZY IF THAT'S

18:25.571 --> 18:27.005
WHAT BIEBER DID.

18:27.072 --> 18:28.841
BUT HE DIDN'T.

18:28.907 --> 18:29.842
BECAUSE A REPORT FROM THE NEW

18:29.908 --> 18:31.243
YORK A.G. LATER REVEALED, FEWER

18:31.310 --> 18:32.244
THAN 2,000 TICKETS WERE ACTUALLY

18:32.311 --> 18:33.345
PUT ON SALE THAT DAY.

18:33.412 --> 18:34.513
AND THAT'S BY NO MEANS

18:34.580 --> 18:35.848
A ONE-OFF.

18:35.914 --> 18:37.583
FOR MANY TOP SHOWS, LESS THAN

18:37.649 --> 18:38.917
25% OF TICKETS ARE INITIALLY

18:38.984 --> 18:41.854
RELEASED TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.689
AND IN AN AUDIT OF THE BLAISDELL

18:43.755 --> 18:45.257
CENTER IN HONOLULU, THEY FOUND

18:45.324 --> 18:46.625
THAT WHEN JANET JACKSON PLAYED

18:46.692 --> 18:48.260
THERE IN 2015, ONLY 8 PERCENT OF

18:48.327 --> 18:50.195
ALL TICKETS WENT TO THE GENERAL

18:50.262 --> 18:51.930
PUBLIC, AND WHEN MARIAH CAREY

18:51.997 --> 18:52.831
PLAYED THERE THE NEXT YEAR,

18:52.898 --> 18:56.301
IT WAS JUST 7 PERCENT.

18:56.368 --> 18:57.803
THAT WAS PRESUMABLY FOR HER

18:57.870 --> 18:58.804
FAMED MARIAH "GOOD FUCKING LUCK

18:58.871 --> 19:00.639

19:00.706 --> 19:01.740

19:02.774 --> 19:05.477
GO, WELL, THEY'RE DELIBERATELY

19:05.544 --> 19:06.078
HELD BACK TO BE SOLD IN OTHER

19:06.144 --> 19:07.980
WAYS.

19:08.046 --> 19:09.615

19:09.681 --> 19:10.382

19:10.449 --> 19:12.117

19:52.090 --> 19:52.591
SILOED AWAY FOR CREDIT-CARD

19:52.658 --> 19:53.225
OFFERS.

19:53.292 --> 19:55.894
THEY CAN ALSO WIND UP BEING PUT

19:55.961 --> 19:57.162
ON SALE BY THE PROMOTER OR A

19:57.229 --> 19:57.796
RADIO STATION OR THROUGH AN

19:57.863 --> 19:59.031
ARTIST'S FAN CLUB.

19:59.097 --> 20:00.098
WHICH SOUNDS FINE!

20:00.165 --> 20:01.199
BUT A LOT OF AVERAGE FANS CAN'T

20:01.266 --> 20:02.334
AFFORD SPECIAL CREDIT CARDS OR

20:02.401 --> 20:03.735
DON'T HAVE TIME TO JUMP THROUGH

20:03.802 --> 20:05.604
HOOPS IN A FAN CLUB.

20:05.671 --> 20:07.906
BUT ONE GROUP VERY MUCH HAS THE

20:07.973 --> 20:09.341
TIME AND THE RESOURCES AND

20:09.408 --> 20:10.075
THAT'S PROFESSIONAL TICKET

20:10.142 --> 20:12.144
BROKERS.

20:12.210 --> 20:13.145
THESE ARE THE INDIVIDUALS OR

20:13.211 --> 20:13.946
COMPANIES THAT BUY UP TONS OF

20:14.012 --> 20:15.113
TICKETS BEFORE YOU CAN GET THEM,

20:15.180 --> 20:16.648
SOMETIMES WITH THE HELP OF

20:16.715 --> 20:17.983
BOTS THAT SNAP THEM UP

20:18.050 --> 20:19.451
INCREDIBLY QUICKLY, BECAUSE --

20:19.518 --> 20:21.687
AS YOU PROBABLY ASSUMED --

20:21.753 --> 20:22.554
ALL THOSE STUPID

20:22.621 --> 20:23.655
"ARE YOU A ROBOT?"

20:23.722 --> 20:24.990
TESTS HAVE VERY MUCH NOT KEPT

20:25.057 --> 20:27.926
THEM ALL OUT.

20:27.993 --> 20:28.894
BECAUSE EVERY TIME TICKET SITES

20:28.961 --> 20:29.661
COME UP WITH A NEW TECHNOLOGY,

20:29.728 --> 20:30.862
BOTS FIND A WAY AROUND IT.

20:30.929 --> 20:32.731
AND ONCE BROKERS HAVE THOSE

20:32.798 --> 20:33.932
TICKETS, THEY'LL FLIP THEM ON

20:33.999 --> 20:34.566
THE SECONDARY MARKET AT A HUGE

20:34.633 --> 20:36.134
MARKUP.

20:36.201 --> 20:37.336
AND AT THIS POINT, WE SHOULD

20:37.402 --> 20:37.836
PROBABLY TALK ABOUT THE

20:37.903 --> 20:40.238
SECONDARY MARKET.

20:40.305 --> 20:41.273
SITES LIKE SEATGEEK,

20:41.340 --> 20:41.640
STUBHUB AND --

20:41.707 --> 20:42.674
SURPRISE, SURPRISE --

20:42.741 --> 20:45.043
TICKETMASTER AGAIN.

20:45.110 --> 20:46.445
THESE SITES BADLY WANT YOU TO

20:46.511 --> 20:47.012
THINK OF THEM AS FAN-TO-FAN

20:47.079 --> 20:49.081
MARKETPLACES.

20:49.147 --> 20:50.849
TICKETMASTER EVEN DESCRIBES ITS

20:50.916 --> 20:52.150
RESALE MARKETPLACE LIKE THIS.

20:52.217 --> 20:52.651
>> OUR OBJECTIVE IS IF

20:52.718 --> 20:54.586
THAT SECONDARY MARKET EXISTS,

20:54.653 --> 20:56.288
WE WANT TO CREATE A SAFE

20:56.355 --> 20:57.422
ENVIRONMENT AND PLATFORM FOR YOU

20:57.489 --> 20:57.756
TO BE ABLE TO

20:57.823 --> 20:59.358
EXCHANGE THOSE TICKETS.

20:59.424 --> 21:00.559
>> YOU'VE BOUGHT TICKETS

21:00.626 --> 21:02.327
TO GO SEE SOMEONE YOU LOVE.

21:02.394 --> 21:03.662
AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR,

21:03.729 --> 21:05.397
YOUR BABYSITTER CAN'T MAKE IT.

21:05.464 --> 21:07.065
YOU SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT

21:07.132 --> 21:08.066
TO RECOUP YOUR COSTS

21:08.133 --> 21:09.601
ON THAT TICKET.

21:09.668 --> 21:11.103
>> John: RIGHT.

21:11.169 --> 21:12.070
THE LAST THING YOU WANT

21:12.137 --> 21:13.505
IS RESENTMENT TOWARD YOUR

21:13.572 --> 21:15.073
BABY TO START FESTERING BECAUSE

21:15.140 --> 21:16.174
OF A MISSED CONCERT.

21:16.241 --> 21:17.242
EVERY TIME YOU LOOK AT THEIR

21:17.309 --> 21:18.910
CHUBBY CHEEKS, YOU'LL JUST

21:18.977 --> 21:19.845
THINK, "IF YOU WEREN'T BORN,

21:19.911 --> 21:21.913
I'D HAVE SEEN THE RED HOT CHILI

21:21.980 --> 21:22.648
PEPPERS LIVE AND I'D BE

21:22.714 --> 21:25.817
HAPPIER."

21:25.884 --> 21:26.652
YOU'RE THE WORST.

21:26.718 --> 21:28.086
BUT THE TRUTH IS, RESALE SITES

21:28.153 --> 21:28.687
ARE NOT JUST "FAN TO FAN," AT

21:28.754 --> 21:30.122
ALL.

21:30.188 --> 21:31.690
IN FACT, A GOVERNMENT REPORT

21:31.757 --> 21:33.225
FOUND THAT "PROFESSIONAL BROKERS

21:33.291 --> 21:34.026
REPRESENT EITHER THE MAJORITY OR

21:34.092 --> 21:35.594
THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF

21:35.661 --> 21:37.663
TICKET SALES" ON THESE SITES.

21:37.729 --> 21:38.530
AND THEY MAKE A LOT OF MONEY

21:38.597 --> 21:39.331
DOING IT.

21:39.398 --> 21:40.932
THE NEW YORK A.G.'S OFFICE FOUND

21:40.999 --> 21:42.634
BROKERS MARK UP THE PRICE OF

21:42.701 --> 21:45.103
TICKETS BY AN ESTIMATED 49% ON

21:45.170 --> 21:47.773
AVERAGE, BUT SOMETIMES BY MORE

21:47.839 --> 21:49.107
THAN 1,000% AND IN ONE

21:49.174 --> 21:52.177
CASE, BY 7,000%.

21:52.244 --> 21:52.978
THAT WAS FOR A ONE DIRECTION

21:53.045 --> 21:53.912
CONCERT.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.914
AND LET ME JUST SAY

21:55.981 --> 21:56.815
I DON'T REGRET IT.

21:56.882 --> 21:58.183
IT WAS WORTH IT.

21:58.250 --> 21:58.984
MY FAVORITE ONE DIRECTION

21:59.051 --> 21:59.918
IS NIALL.

21:59.985 --> 22:00.852
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO THE OTHER

22:00.919 --> 22:01.319
ONES ARE.

22:01.386 --> 22:02.187
AND I GET MAD WHEN THEY SING

22:02.254 --> 22:04.523
OVER THE TOP OF HIM.

22:04.589 --> 22:05.290
AND TICKET-SELLING SITES GO OUT

22:05.357 --> 22:07.559
OF THEIR WAY TO CATER TO THEIR

22:07.626 --> 22:08.960
BROKER CLIENTS, BECAUSE THEY

22:09.027 --> 22:10.262
BRING THEM IN A LOT OF MONEY.

22:10.328 --> 22:11.830
FOR INSTANCE, WHILE THEY LIMIT

22:11.897 --> 22:13.098
THE NUMBER OF TICKETS ANY ONE

22:13.165 --> 22:14.833
ACCOUNT CAN BUY TO AN EVENT,

22:14.900 --> 22:16.301
THERE'S AN OBVIOUS WAY FOR

22:16.368 --> 22:17.502
BROKERS TO GET AROUND THAT, AND

22:17.569 --> 22:18.837
THAT'S SIMPLY TO HAVE MORE THAN

22:18.904 --> 22:20.305
ONE ACCOUNT.

22:20.372 --> 22:21.807
THIS IS A PRACTICE TICKETMASTER

22:21.873 --> 22:23.308
HAS LONG BEEN AWARE OF.

22:23.375 --> 22:25.143
THERE'S A TICKET-BROKER

22:25.210 --> 22:26.912
CONFERENCE IN VEGAS EACH YEAR.

22:26.978 --> 22:28.480
JUST WATCH WHAT HAPPENED WHEN

22:28.547 --> 22:29.815
REPORTERS WENT UNDERCOVER THERE,

22:29.881 --> 22:30.315
AND TALKED TO SOMEONE AT

22:30.382 --> 22:32.050
TICKETMASTER'S BOOTH.

22:32.117 --> 22:33.418
>> TICKETMASTER WAS BUSY

22:33.485 --> 22:39.424
SURROUNDED BY SCALPERS SOME OF

22:39.491 --> 22:40.559
>> I WANT TO KNOW THE STRAIGHT

22:40.625 --> 22:41.259
GOODS ON WHETHER TICKETMASTER IS

22:41.326 --> 22:41.793
GOING TO BE POLICING US

22:41.860 --> 22:42.427
USING OUR MULTIPLE

22:42.494 --> 22:43.228
ACCOUNTS.

22:43.295 --> 22:44.162
>> UH, NO.

22:44.229 --> 22:45.430
I HAVE A GENTLEMAN WHO'S

22:45.497 --> 22:46.465
GOT OVER 200 TICKETMASTER.COM

22:46.531 --> 22:46.998
ACCOUNTS.

22:47.065 --> 22:48.500
>> HOW MANY BROKERS ARE USING

22:48.567 --> 22:51.503
MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS?

22:51.570 --> 22:52.270
>> I'D SAY PRETTY DAMN NEAR

22:52.337 --> 22:53.238
EVERY ONE OF THEM.

22:53.305 --> 22:54.272
>> John: YEAH.

22:54.339 --> 22:55.807
OF COURSE THEY ARE!

22:55.874 --> 22:56.374
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT STOPPING

22:56.441 --> 22:58.310
THEM.

22:58.376 --> 23:02.581
I WILL SAY

23:02.647 --> 23:07.319
I'M IN AWE OF ANYONE WHO CAN

23:07.385 --> 23:08.553
REMEMBER USERNAMES AND PASSWORDS

23:08.620 --> 23:09.354
FOR OVER 200 ACCOUNTS.

23:09.421 --> 23:10.055
I USE ONE PASSWORD FOR ALL MY

23:10.122 --> 23:10.756
ACCOUNTS, AND IT'S "NIALL HORAN

23:10.822 --> 23:11.423
IS THE BEST ONE DIRECTION,

23:11.490 --> 23:12.324
EXCLAMATION MARK."

23:12.390 --> 23:13.291
DON'T TELL ANYONE.

23:13.358 --> 23:14.459
NOW, I HAVE TO TELL YOU

23:14.526 --> 23:15.560
TICKETMASTER INSISTS IT SPENDS

23:15.627 --> 23:17.195
MILLIONS ON TECHNOLOGY TO WEED

23:17.262 --> 23:18.130
OUT BAD BEHAVIOR, AND THAT THAT

23:18.196 --> 23:18.730
EMPLOYEE'S COMMENTS WEREN'T

23:18.797 --> 23:20.132
REFLECTIVE OF ITS POLICIES.

23:20.198 --> 23:21.333
BUT EVEN TAKING THEM AT THEIR

23:21.399 --> 23:22.801
WORD, WHICH I'M NOT INCLINED

23:22.868 --> 23:24.536
TO DO, THEIR WHOLE SYSTEM IS

23:24.603 --> 23:27.072
DESIGNED TO BE OPAQUE.

23:27.139 --> 23:28.874
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

23:28.940 --> 23:33.545
BROKERS SELLING TICKETS, BECAUSE

23:33.612 --> 23:34.913
THE OTHER RESALE SITES ACTIVELY

23:34.980 --> 23:35.547
CHOOSE TO PROVIDE ANONYMITY TO

23:35.614 --> 23:37.048
THEM.

23:37.115 --> 23:38.250
SO WHEN YOU BUY A TICKET ON THE

23:38.316 --> 23:39.251
SECONDARY MARKET, THERE'S NO WAY

23:39.317 --> 23:40.318
TO KNOW THE IDENTITY OF WHO

23:40.385 --> 23:41.520
YOU'RE BUYING FROM, WHETHER

23:41.586 --> 23:44.489
IT'S A FAN WHOSE BABYSITTER

23:44.556 --> 23:45.891
JUST CANCELED OR A BROKER WHO

23:45.957 --> 23:46.758
MIGHT HAVE 500 OTHER TICKETS ON

23:46.825 --> 23:48.360
SALE FOR THAT SAME EVENT.

23:48.426 --> 23:49.494
WHICH, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

23:49.561 --> 23:50.796
IS A BIT WEIRD.

23:50.862 --> 23:52.397
ON MOST SITES WHERE PEOPLE

23:52.464 --> 23:53.698
RESELL THINGS, YOU CAN SEE

23:53.765 --> 23:54.633
WHO YOU'RE BUYING FROM.

23:54.699 --> 23:57.035
TAKE EBAY.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.737
IF YOU SAW THIS LISTING, FOR A

23:58.804 --> 24:01.006
MICKEY MOUSE SHAPED POTATO

24:01.072 --> 24:02.374
AVAILABLE FOR $50, YOU COULD

24:02.440 --> 24:04.142
LOOK AT THE SELLER, SEE THEIR

24:04.209 --> 24:04.876
USERNAME, KNOW THAT THEY HAVE

24:04.943 --> 24:06.378
A 100% FAVORABLE RATING,

24:06.444 --> 24:06.945
AND FEEL CONFIDENT IN YOUR

24:07.012 --> 24:08.713
PURCHASE.

24:08.780 --> 24:09.881
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.917
YOU'RE THINKING, "JOHN, YOU

24:11.983 --> 24:13.652
BOUGHT THAT POTATO,

24:13.718 --> 24:16.254
DIDN'T YOU?

24:16.321 --> 24:17.088
AND IT'S UNDER YOUR DESK,

24:17.155 --> 24:18.156
ISN'T IT?"

24:18.223 --> 24:20.192
NO.

24:20.258 --> 24:20.859
IT'S NOT UNDER MY DESK.

24:20.926 --> 24:21.226
IT'S OVER HERE!

24:21.293 --> 24:24.396
BEHOLD!

24:24.462 --> 24:26.097
OF COURSE WE BOUGHT IT.

24:26.164 --> 24:26.998
AS YOU CAN SEE,

24:27.065 --> 24:27.566
IT DEFINITELY KIND OF LOOKS

24:27.632 --> 24:31.436
A BIT LIKE MICKEY MOUSE!

24:31.503 --> 24:33.772
THE POINT IS, BROKERS, WITH

24:33.839 --> 24:35.240
THEIR IDENTITIES CONCEALED,

24:35.307 --> 24:37.108
CAN SNAP UP LARGE NUMBERS OF

24:37.175 --> 24:37.742
TICKETS AND RESELL THEM

24:37.809 --> 24:38.743
AT A MASSIVE MARKUP.

24:38.810 --> 24:40.412
MEANWHILE, THE SECONDARY-MARKET

24:40.478 --> 24:41.947
SITES ARE THEMSELVES MAKING

24:42.013 --> 24:43.648
MONEY BY CHARGING A PERCENTAGE

24:43.715 --> 24:44.382
ON THOSE LUDICROUS TICKET

24:44.449 --> 24:46.318
PRICES.

24:46.384 --> 24:48.486
WE FOUND A TICKET FOR ADELE

24:48.553 --> 24:50.388
SELLING ON SEATGEEK FOR $1,690,

24:50.455 --> 24:53.058
PLUS $538 IN FEES.

24:53.124 --> 24:54.392
AND LOOK, HERE'S WHERE WE NEED

24:54.459 --> 24:55.460
TO DEAL WITH AN UNCOMFORTABLE

24:55.527 --> 24:56.194
FACT.

24:56.261 --> 24:57.462
WHICH IS THE QUESTION OF WHAT

24:57.529 --> 24:59.364
THAT TICKET IS ACTUALLY WORTH.

24:59.431 --> 25:01.867
BECAUSE AN ECONOMIST WILL TELL

25:01.933 --> 25:03.235
YOU IT'S WORTH WHATEVER PEOPLE

25:03.301 --> 25:03.835
WILL PAY.

25:03.902 --> 25:04.970
SO IF SOMEONE'S WILLING TO SPEND

25:05.036 --> 25:06.238
OVER $2,000, INCLUDING FEES, FOR

25:06.304 --> 25:09.007
AN ADELE TICKET, THAT'S WHAT

25:09.074 --> 25:09.808
IT'S WORTH, AS GROSS AS THAT

25:09.875 --> 25:11.543
SOUNDS.

25:11.610 --> 25:12.978
BUT IF ADELE DOESN'T WANT TO

25:13.044 --> 25:14.746
CHARGE THAT, THERE'S GOING TO BE

25:14.813 --> 25:16.882
A GAP BETWEEN THE FACE VALUE OF

25:16.948 --> 25:18.717
THE TICKET AND WHAT SOMEONE CAN

25:18.783 --> 25:21.486
GET FOR IT, AND A WHOLE INDUSTRY

25:21.553 --> 25:22.821
IS SCRAMBLING TO EXPLOIT IT.

25:22.888 --> 25:23.788
AND UNFORTUNATELY, LIVE EVENTS

25:23.855 --> 25:25.323
ARE UNIQUELY VULNERABLE TO THIS,

25:25.390 --> 25:26.892
BECAUSE THEY'RE INHERENTLY RARE.

25:26.958 --> 25:28.827
BAD BUNNY, FOR INSTANCE, IS

25:28.894 --> 25:29.961
PROBABLY ONLY COMING TO YOUR

25:30.028 --> 25:31.930
TOWN ONCE A YEAR AT MOST,

25:31.997 --> 25:33.265
AND A LOT MORE PEOPLE WANT TO

25:33.331 --> 25:34.366
SEE HIM THAN THERE ARE SEATS.

25:34.432 --> 25:36.134
AND WHILE BAD BUNNY COULD CHARGE

25:36.201 --> 25:38.803
THE GOING RATE FOR EVERY TICKET,

25:38.870 --> 25:40.272
HE PROBABLY DOESN'T WANT TO DO

25:40.338 --> 25:40.972
THAT BECAUSE HE'D LOOK LIKE AN

25:41.039 --> 25:43.408
ASSHOLE.

25:43.475 --> 25:44.276
WHICH HE VERY MUCH ISN'T.

25:44.342 --> 25:45.043
HE'S NOT A BAD BUNNY AT ALL.

25:45.110 --> 25:47.679
DESPITE THE NAME.

25:47.746 --> 25:49.281
IF HE'S ANYTHING,

25:49.347 --> 25:50.448
HE'S A VERY GOOD BUNNY.

25:50.515 --> 25:51.583
AND AS LONG AS ARTISTS -- WITH

25:51.650 --> 25:54.152
ALL GOOD INTENTIONS -- PRICE

25:54.219 --> 25:55.787
THEIR TICKETS BELOW THE MARKET,

25:55.854 --> 25:56.421
EXPLOITATION IS GOING TO HAPPEN,

25:56.488 --> 25:57.422
AND THAT WOMAN'S HUSBAND IS

25:57.489 --> 25:59.758
GOING TO HAVE TO SHOW FEET.

25:59.824 --> 26:01.126
ALTHOUGH IT'S WORTH NOTING

26:01.192 --> 26:02.093
SOME ARTISTS HAVE TRIED TO

26:02.160 --> 26:03.962
SNEAKILY GET THE SCALPER PRICE

26:04.029 --> 26:05.163
FOR THEIR TICKETS WITHOUT ANYONE

26:05.230 --> 26:06.798
REALLY NOTICING.

26:06.865 --> 26:10.101
REMEMBER HOW JUSTIN BIEBER WAS

26:10.168 --> 26:10.936
SUPPOSEDLY SELLING OUT VENUES

26:11.002 --> 26:11.636
IN SECONDS, WHILE TONS OF

26:11.703 --> 26:12.570
TICKETS WERE HELD BACK?

26:12.637 --> 26:13.939
AT ANOTHER STOP ON THAT TOUR,

26:14.005 --> 26:16.574
REPORTERS LOOKED INTO SOME OF

26:16.641 --> 26:17.642
THE TICKETS ON RESALE SITES AND

26:17.709 --> 26:19.177
FOUND SOMETHING SURPRISING.

26:19.244 --> 26:20.578
>> SECTION 205, ROW G,

26:20.645 --> 26:23.348
14 TICKETS LISTED FOR $246 EACH

26:23.415 --> 26:24.516
AND GET THIS.

26:24.582 --> 26:26.685
TICKETING DOCUMENTS SHOW THAT

26:26.751 --> 26:28.687
ENTIRE G ROW WENT TO BIEBER'S

26:28.753 --> 26:29.321
OWN TOUR.

26:29.387 --> 26:30.855
>> I THINK THERE IS NO QUESTION

26:30.922 --> 26:31.957
WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THE DOCUMENT

26:32.023 --> 26:33.058
THAT BIEBER IS SCALPING

26:33.124 --> 26:35.093
HIS OWN TICKETS.

26:35.160 --> 26:36.861
>> John: YEAH.

26:36.928 --> 26:37.662
IT'S TRUE.

26:37.729 --> 26:38.630
A GROUP OF TICKETS HELD

26:38.697 --> 26:39.431
FOR BIEBER'S TOUR ENDED UP

26:39.497 --> 26:40.065
RELEASED NOT TO THE BOX OFFICE,

26:40.131 --> 26:41.032
BUT STRAIGHT TO THE SECONDARY

26:41.099 --> 26:42.300
MARKET.

26:42.367 --> 26:44.002
AND ON ONE HAND, I GET THE

26:44.069 --> 26:45.870
IMPULSE OF, "IF SOMEONE'S GOING

26:45.937 --> 26:47.305
TO MAKE $246 OFF THAT TICKET,

26:47.372 --> 26:48.707
SHOULDN'T IT BE THE PERSON DOING

26:48.773 --> 26:49.607
THE PERFORMING?"

26:49.674 --> 26:53.611
BUT IT STILL DOESN'T FEEL GREAT,

26:53.678 --> 26:54.646
DOES IT?

26:54.713 --> 26:55.847
AND IT'S ALSO NOT GOING TO STOP

26:55.914 --> 26:56.581
ME FROM SHOWING YOU THAT CLIP OF

26:56.648 --> 26:59.484
HIM FALLING DOWN A HOLE AGAIN.

26:59.551 --> 27:04.422
EXCELLENT.

27:04.489 --> 27:06.725
IT GETS BETTER EVERY TIME

27:06.791 --> 27:07.625
YOU SEE IT.

27:07.692 --> 27:08.460
BIEBER'S NOT UNIQUE IN DOING

27:08.526 --> 27:09.361
THIS.

27:09.427 --> 27:10.261
A FEW YEARS BACK, IT EMERGED

27:10.328 --> 27:10.929
THAT LIVE NATION HAD HELPED

27:10.996 --> 27:11.596
METALLICA PLACE TICKETS DIRECTLY

27:11.663 --> 27:12.097
ONTO THE RESALE MARKET,

27:12.163 --> 27:13.498
ADMITTING ABOUT A DOZEN OTHER

27:13.565 --> 27:14.933
ARTISTS HAD ASKED THEM TO DO

27:15.000 --> 27:16.568
THIS IN RECENT YEARS.

27:16.634 --> 27:17.635
AND BEFORE YOU WORRY.

27:17.702 --> 27:18.503
NO.

27:18.570 --> 27:20.405
I'M NOT ONE OF THE ARTISTS

27:20.472 --> 27:21.339
PUTTING TICKETS TO THIS SHOW

27:21.406 --> 27:22.207
STRAIGHT ONTO THE RESALE MARKET.

27:22.273 --> 27:23.208
WE DO IT THE RIGHT WAY,

27:23.274 --> 27:25.110
DISTRIBUTING TICKETS AT RANDOM,

27:25.176 --> 27:26.444
TO ANYONE WALKING PAST THE

27:26.511 --> 27:28.713
STUDIO AT THE TIME.

27:28.780 --> 27:29.347
HALF THESE IDIOTS THINK I'M THE

27:29.414 --> 27:31.249
WARMUP ACT FOR DREW BARRYMORE.

27:31.316 --> 27:35.320
SHE'LL BE OUT ANY MINUTE, FOLKS.

27:35.387 --> 27:38.323
SHE'LL BE OUT ANY MINUTE.

27:38.390 --> 27:39.524
SHE'S SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

27:39.591 --> 27:40.425
SO, WHEN YOU TAKE ALL THIS

27:40.492 --> 27:41.359
TOGETHER, THE REASON TICKETS ARE

27:41.426 --> 27:43.194
SO HARD TO GET WHEN THEY'RE ON

27:43.261 --> 27:43.928
SALE IS THAT THEY'RE OFTEN NOT

27:43.995 --> 27:44.996
ON SALE.

27:45.063 --> 27:46.564
AND THE REASON THEY COST SO MUCH

27:46.631 --> 27:47.699
ON THE SECONDARY MARKET IS THAT

27:47.766 --> 27:49.334
YOU'RE PAYING EXORBITANT FEES TO

27:49.401 --> 27:51.803
THE PLATFORM AND MIGHT BE

27:51.870 --> 27:52.804
BUYING FROM A BROKER OR IN RARE

27:52.871 --> 27:53.838
CASES, EVEN FROM THE ARTIST

27:53.905 --> 27:54.139
THEMSELVES.

27:54.205 --> 27:55.874
AND THIS WHOLE ECOSYSTEM

27:55.940 --> 27:57.742
ENRICHES A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO

27:57.809 --> 27:59.511
DON'T CONTRIBUTE ANYTHING TO THE

27:59.577 --> 28:00.445
ACTUAL SHOW YOU ARE PAYING TO

28:00.512 --> 28:02.213
SEE.

28:02.280 --> 28:03.581
AND AT THE CENTER OF ALL THIS IS

28:03.648 --> 28:05.550
TICKETMASTER, BECAUSE IT

28:05.617 --> 28:07.252
TURBOCHARGED MANY OF THE SHITTY

28:07.318 --> 28:07.852
PRACTICES THAT HAVE NOW BECOME

28:07.919 --> 28:09.687
INDUSTRY STANDARD.

28:09.754 --> 28:11.623
SO WHAT CAN WE DO?

28:11.689 --> 28:13.024
WELL, CONGRESS COULD INJECT

28:13.091 --> 28:14.559
TRANSPARENCY INTO THIS PROCESS,

28:14.626 --> 28:16.094
BY PASSING LAWS THAT REQUIRE

28:16.161 --> 28:17.495
SITES TO DISCLOSE THEIR FEES UP

28:17.562 --> 28:18.663
FRONT, ALONG WITH THE IDENTITY

28:18.730 --> 28:25.270
OF THE SELLER ON RESALE SITES.

28:25.336 --> 28:26.404
BUT THE TRUTH IS MUCH OF THE

28:26.471 --> 28:27.705
POWER IS ACTUALLY IN THE HANDS

28:27.772 --> 28:28.506
OF ARTISTS HERE.

28:28.573 --> 28:29.140
BECAUSE THE BIGGEST ONES COULD

28:29.207 --> 28:29.908
DO THINGS TO TAMP DOWN THE

28:29.974 --> 28:30.575
SECONDARY MARKET, LIKE MAKING

28:30.642 --> 28:31.910
THEIR TICKETS NON-TRANSFERABLE,

28:31.976 --> 28:33.745
MEANING RESALE IS RESTRICTED.

28:33.812 --> 28:34.979
BANDS LIKE PEARL JAM HAVE

28:35.046 --> 28:36.915
EXPERIMENTED WITH THIS, AND

28:36.981 --> 28:37.816
BEFORE THEIR 2020 TOUR WAS

28:37.882 --> 28:38.917
POSTPONED, THEY EVEN WORKED WITH

28:38.983 --> 28:41.252
TICKETMASTER TO CREATE AN ONLINE

28:41.319 --> 28:41.820
MARKETPLACE WHERE FANS COULD

28:41.886 --> 28:43.455
SELL TICKETS THEY DIDN'T NEED,

28:43.521 --> 28:45.190
BUT WITH NO ADDITIONAL FEES AND

28:45.256 --> 28:47.158
NOT FOR A PROFIT.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.860
THAT SEEMS LIKE THE MODEL

28:48.927 --> 28:51.629
EVERYONE SHOULD BE USING.

28:51.696 --> 28:52.864
BUT IF REGULATORS DON'T ACT, AND

28:52.931 --> 28:53.531
ARTISTS DON'T HAVE THE CLOUT OR

28:53.598 --> 28:54.599
THE INCLINATION TO REQUIRE

28:54.666 --> 28:59.904
COMPANIES TO PUT THOSE

28:59.971 --> 29:01.439
GUARDRAILS IN PLACE, I'M AFRAID

29:01.506 --> 29:02.340
YOU AS A FAN ARE GOING TO REMAIN

29:02.407 --> 29:03.141
VULNERABLE TO THE WORST PARTS OF

29:03.208 --> 29:03.975
THIS SYSTEM.

29:04.042 --> 29:05.043
ONE DRIVEN BY ONE OF THE MOST

29:05.110 --> 29:08.113
WIDELY LOATHED COMPANIES ON

29:08.179 --> 29:09.380
THE PLANET THAT BECAME EVEN

29:09.447 --> 29:10.081
BIGGER, DUE TO A MERGER THAT

29:10.148 --> 29:10.715
PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN

29:10.782 --> 29:12.217
ALLOWED.

29:12.283 --> 29:14.552
AND I KNOW ALL THIS MAY FEEL

29:14.619 --> 29:15.453
A LITTLE UNSATISFYING.

29:15.520 --> 29:17.055
BUT IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION, I

29:17.122 --> 29:18.590
PERSONALLY PROMISE TO CONTINUE

29:18.656 --> 29:20.558
TO OFFER THE ONLY ACCURATELY

29:20.625 --> 29:22.894
PRICED ENTERTAINMENT ON THE

29:22.961 --> 29:27.031
MARKET.

29:27.098 --> 29:28.299
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

29:28.366 --> 29:29.167
ONE IN WHICH TICKETS FOR

29:29.234 --> 29:30.401
THIS SHOW REMAIN AVAILABLE FOR

29:30.468 --> 29:31.936
FREE AND YOU CAN COME WATCH A

29:32.003 --> 29:34.939
DECAYING MAN SHOUT NUMBERS,

29:35.006 --> 29:36.574
APPLY LIP GLOSS SHODDILY,

29:36.641 --> 29:37.642
AND SHAMELESSLY EARN BACK YOUR

29:37.709 --> 29:39.010
GOOD WILL BY SHOWING YOU A

29:39.077 --> 29:40.612
POTATO THAT, YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,

29:40.678 --> 29:41.212
DOES LOOK A BIT LIKE A FAMOUS

29:41.279 --> 29:43.381
MOUSE.

29:43.448 --> 29:45.950
THAT IS OUR SHOW.

29:46.017 --> 29:46.851
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

29:46.918 --> 29:47.285
WE'RE OFF NEXT WEEK.

29:47.352 --> 29:48.253
WE'LL BE BACK AFTER THAT.

29:48.319 --> 29:56.661
GOOD NIGHT!
