<i>and the Beast:</i>

00:04.459 --> 00:05.226
(growling)

00:08.996 --> 00:10.897
Vincent! Vincent!

00:10.964 --> 00:12.365
Don't shoot!

00:12.433 --> 00:14.334
She's my daughter.

00:14.402 --> 00:17.770
CATHERINE: Come on, damn it!
I need you alive.

00:17.838 --> 00:19.739
(gasps)
<i>Catherine, I know I haven't</i>

00:19.806 --> 00:21.574
earned your trust back yet.

00:21.642 --> 00:24.576
But the only way I can truly
make amends is to keep trying.

00:24.644 --> 00:26.611
I never stopped looking for you.

00:26.679 --> 00:27.946
Who are you?

00:29.649 --> 00:31.616
(growling)

00:33.786 --> 00:35.720
There are more
of them out there.

00:35.788 --> 00:37.956
<i>Who pays for that boat?</i>
<i>Is someone controlling you?</i>

00:38.024 --> 00:39.857
I don't even know
who you are!

00:39.925 --> 00:40.624
(gasps)

00:40.692 --> 00:41.625
(growls)

00:41.693 --> 00:43.694
(gasping)

00:45.264 --> 00:46.697
I remembered it.

00:46.765 --> 00:48.799
Vincent, please don't
do this right now.

00:48.867 --> 00:51.635
I know they're just flashes,
but I remember you.

00:51.703 --> 00:52.636
It's too late.

00:52.704 --> 00:54.071
That relationship

00:54.138 --> 00:55.272
that you're remembering,

00:55.339 --> 00:57.040
I can't handle it.

01:11.888 --> 01:13.322
This is what happens

01:13.390 --> 01:15.657
when you put your life on hold
for four months.

01:15.725 --> 01:17.159
Your room turns
into a mess.

01:17.227 --> 01:18.594
Just the room?

01:18.661 --> 01:20.896
I cannot find my favorite heels.

01:20.964 --> 01:22.565
Okay, well, I like the shoes
you've been wearing

01:22.632 --> 01:25.734
for the last ten minutes.

01:25.802 --> 01:26.834
(sighs)

01:26.902 --> 01:29.104
You're right, this is fine.

01:29.171 --> 01:30.605
Okay.

01:30.672 --> 01:32.107
I just want to go out

01:32.174 --> 01:34.275
and have fun
for a change,

01:34.343 --> 01:36.811
instead of sitting around here
being p.o.'d all the time.

01:36.878 --> 01:38.480
Right, cause it's not
like you have anything

01:38.547 --> 01:39.814
to be p.o'd about.

01:39.881 --> 01:41.816
Right, but that's done.

01:41.883 --> 01:43.950
I had a good cry,
I meditated,

01:44.018 --> 01:46.786
I took a kickboxing class,
I'm over it.

01:46.854 --> 01:49.356
Really?
Over which part exactly?

01:49.424 --> 01:51.291
The sister moving away part?

01:51.359 --> 01:53.127
The father who wasn't
really your father?

01:53.194 --> 01:57.097
The amnesiac boyfriend who lies
and, you know, kills?

01:57.165 --> 02:00.466
Only other beasts,
and occasionally,

02:00.534 --> 02:03.802
bad guys who are,
who are really bad.

02:03.870 --> 02:05.638
Yeah, a little meditating,
a little kickboxing...

02:05.705 --> 02:08.874
Okay, my life is a mess.
Are you happy?

02:08.942 --> 02:10.709
Only if you switch out those earrings.
They're too dangly.

02:10.776 --> 02:12.044
I can't, I just can't.
I can't.

02:12.112 --> 02:13.646
Tess, I don't know
what to do.

02:13.713 --> 02:15.480
My head was reeling enough
with all the Vincent stuff,

02:15.548 --> 02:16.714
and now with
everything else,

02:16.782 --> 02:18.383
I don't know
what to believe.

02:18.451 --> 02:20.552
Well, can I make a suggestion?
A glass of wine?

02:20.620 --> 02:22.387
Mm, I was gonna say therapy.

02:22.455 --> 02:24.022
No, but that's <i>your</i> job.

02:24.089 --> 02:26.691
And tonight you are going
to counsel me

02:26.759 --> 02:31.328
to forget everything and
go out and have fun, okay?

02:31.396 --> 02:34.331
Hey, you know I'm the number one
supporter of the beast time-out,

02:34.399 --> 02:37.168
but Cat, do you really think
you can just wake up one day

02:37.235 --> 02:39.036
and be done with Vincent?
Be done? No.

02:39.103 --> 02:40.837
But I can't wait till I'm 60

02:40.905 --> 02:43.040
for him to get all
of his memory back

02:43.107 --> 02:45.643
or to tell me who's sending him
out on these missions.

02:45.710 --> 02:48.578
I can't live with any more lies.

02:48.646 --> 02:50.180
All right, like I said,
I'm all in.

02:50.247 --> 02:53.883
First, you had to figure out
you, then maybe Vincent.

02:53.950 --> 02:55.818
Yeah. Vincent who?

03:00.658 --> 03:02.939
I need to get through your list
as soon as possible, okay?

03:02.992 --> 03:04.693
So, tell me, who's next?

03:04.760 --> 03:06.562
Oh, it's not that easy.

03:06.629 --> 03:08.897
It takes time
to find these beasts.

03:08.964 --> 03:10.832
I gotta get intel, vet it first

03:10.900 --> 03:12.568
so you know
what you're up against.

03:12.635 --> 03:14.936
I don't give a damn
what I'm up against, right?

03:15.004 --> 03:16.338
I'll handle it.

03:16.406 --> 03:18.272
I just need this over
and done with.

03:18.340 --> 03:20.107
What's going on here?

03:20.175 --> 03:21.842
Why the sudden rush?
What happened?

03:21.910 --> 03:24.445
Is this something
to do with Catherine?

03:29.318 --> 03:30.518
Yeah.

03:32.287 --> 03:33.721
You know what?

03:33.788 --> 03:35.222
Yes, it does, okay?

03:35.289 --> 03:37.190
I remembered something
about her.

03:37.258 --> 03:40.193
You know, it wasn't much--
it was just a flash or two--

03:40.261 --> 03:42.429
but sir, it is messing
with my head, okay?

03:42.496 --> 03:44.130
I feel like I'm
two different people,

03:44.198 --> 03:45.798
and it's driving me crazy.

03:45.866 --> 03:48.735
Vincent, we've had
this conversation before.

03:48.802 --> 03:51.737
You are a soldier
on a mission, period.

03:51.804 --> 03:53.939
Anything that distracts you
from that mission

03:54.006 --> 03:55.073
makes you vulnerable,
splits your focus,

03:55.141 --> 03:56.775
and you've got to stay focused

03:56.843 --> 03:59.278
because you are the only one
who can stop these beasts.

03:59.346 --> 04:01.813
Yeah, well find me another damn
mission so I can focus, okay?

04:01.881 --> 04:03.749
So I can get Catherine out
of my head.

04:03.816 --> 04:05.384
You need to stay away from her.

04:05.452 --> 04:07.985
Yeah, and you need to find me
another beast.

04:10.489 --> 04:13.324
(sirens wailing, horn blaring)

04:27.705 --> 04:30.974
It is an unbelievable scene,
as you can see behind me,

04:31.041 --> 04:35.746
which FDNY says is burning
hotter than an aircraft fire.

04:35.813 --> 04:39.348
Investigators said evidence
from yesterday's fire suggests

04:39.416 --> 04:42.618
the arsonist sets off these
incendiary devices by hand,

04:42.686 --> 04:45.621
which should be fatal,
but with no body recovered,

04:45.689 --> 04:48.658
investigators are still trying
to figure out how

04:48.725 --> 04:51.260
the arsonist survives
and escapes these attacks.

04:51.328 --> 04:53.962
He's not a human,
he's a beast-- that's how.

04:54.030 --> 04:56.510
One theory is that the arsonist
wears a vermiculite entry suit.

04:56.532 --> 04:59.634
These are large, silver
fire-retardant suits

04:59.702 --> 05:01.603
used when firefighters
are battling blazes...

05:01.671 --> 05:03.305
Maybe he <i>is</i> the suit.

05:03.372 --> 05:04.773
...above 2,000 degrees.

05:04.840 --> 05:07.008
One problem
with this theory is that...

05:07.075 --> 05:08.209
Someone get me Chandler!

05:09.545 --> 05:10.278
Fast!

05:12.246 --> 05:15.882
You know you don't have
to hit it so hard, right?

05:15.950 --> 05:17.384
Yeah, I do.

05:17.452 --> 05:19.653
Wow... Want to talk
about it some more?

05:19.721 --> 05:25.793
No, I'm having fun.

05:25.860 --> 05:28.027
Which I'm all for, but we don't
have to go the whole night

05:28.094 --> 05:29.161
pretending like
nothing's wrong.

05:29.229 --> 05:31.063
Well, then what was the point

05:31.131 --> 05:32.231
of those
three mind erasers?

05:32.299 --> 05:33.633
(sighs)

05:33.701 --> 05:35.901
Who are you right now?
Hi. I'm Colin.

05:35.969 --> 05:39.171
I just wanted to introduce
myself: I'm Colin.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.207
And I am in the middle
of something.

05:41.274 --> 05:42.507
Excuse me.

05:42.542 --> 05:44.175
I may never see
you again.

05:44.243 --> 05:46.345
You're the most beautiful girl
I've have ever seen..

05:46.412 --> 05:48.079
Oh, that is sour.

05:48.180 --> 05:49.681
And really, I'm good.

05:49.749 --> 05:51.049
You just want to go?

05:51.116 --> 05:52.050
No, we're having fun.

05:52.117 --> 05:53.418
Yeah.
Not with you.

05:53.453 --> 05:54.786
You should go.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.555
Come on, now,
why don't you like me?

05:56.622 --> 05:58.122
Dude, it's not a petting zoo.

05:58.157 --> 05:59.223
Now you should stop

05:59.290 --> 06:01.058
before you do
something stupid.

06:01.125 --> 06:02.460
I'm a cop.

06:02.494 --> 06:03.527
We both are.

06:03.595 --> 06:05.295
Like, like, partners?

06:05.364 --> 06:08.265
Oh, it's starting
to make sense, okay.

06:08.333 --> 06:09.967
My bad.
All right, makeup hug.

06:10.034 --> 06:11.301
No, I don't need a hug.

06:11.370 --> 06:12.737
Oh, come here.
Come here. Come on.

06:12.804 --> 06:14.271
Just one hug.
Makeup hug. Come here.

06:14.339 --> 06:16.439
(patrons gasp)

06:16.507 --> 06:18.241
Bitch,
that's my friend!

06:20.544 --> 06:22.979
(clears throat)
Hey!

06:23.046 --> 06:24.481
No, Cat!

06:24.548 --> 06:25.948
(patrons gasp)

06:26.049 --> 06:27.917
Judge Gavin?

06:27.985 --> 06:29.652
Having fun yet?

06:40.516 --> 06:42.124
It's not enough
a serial arsonist

06:42.125 --> 06:43.559
is burning down Manhattan,

06:43.627 --> 06:45.695
now my two best detectives
punch out a judge

06:45.763 --> 06:46.862
and get themselves
arrested?

06:46.930 --> 06:47.641
I was just trying
to have fun.

06:47.642 --> 06:49.145
I didn't mean
to get in trouble.

06:49.146 --> 06:51.076
Trouble is getting
a flat tire.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.711
You flattened a judge.

06:52.779 --> 06:54.479
Not just any judge,
a federal judge.

06:54.547 --> 06:55.814
Do you have any idea

06:55.882 --> 06:57.682
what I had to go through
to get you out?

06:57.751 --> 06:59.118
A lot, I know, but...

06:59.185 --> 07:00.518
Look, I'm juggling
enough around here

07:00.586 --> 07:02.287
trying to keep the lid
on you know what,

07:02.355 --> 07:04.155
and then you go off
and do this?

07:04.223 --> 07:06.323
You know, it wasn't
exactly intentional.

07:06.391 --> 07:07.658
Cops don't start
barroom brawls.

07:07.726 --> 07:09.360
And why didn't you answer
your phone?

07:09.427 --> 07:10.694
I was calling you all night.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.196
Why? What's wrong?

07:12.264 --> 07:13.664
A lot.

07:13.732 --> 07:16.200
Sorry, this is between
me and Catherine.

07:19.137 --> 07:20.804
I'll bet.

07:23.141 --> 07:26.376
Aren't arson investigators
supposed to hunt arsonists?

07:26.443 --> 07:27.644
Not when the arsonist
is a beast.

07:27.711 --> 07:29.512
That's why
I called you.

07:29.580 --> 07:33.917
Since when do beasts burn down
office buildings or law firms?

07:33.985 --> 07:36.418
Or save college girls from
assassins and kill FBI agents?

07:36.486 --> 07:42.258
Okay, but Muirfield normally
built beasts for a reason.

07:42.325 --> 07:44.927
How could setting fires be...?

07:44.995 --> 07:48.063
Oil rigs in Khafji,
Dammam, Jeddah.

07:48.131 --> 07:50.099
Half a billion in lost profits

07:50.167 --> 07:51.933
'cause it took wildcatters
months to extinguish them.

07:52.001 --> 07:54.235
So, what, they made
super-wildcatters instead?

07:54.303 --> 07:55.703
Absolutely.

07:55.771 --> 07:57.438
Muirfield makes these
guys fire-resistant

07:57.506 --> 08:00.208
and then sends them in to put
out these fires for a huge fee.

08:00.276 --> 08:02.076
I wouldn't be surprised
if Big Oil's

08:02.144 --> 08:04.745
helping to fund the research.
I had JT look into it.

08:04.814 --> 08:09.049
It turns out there are
several heat-resistant organisms

08:09.117 --> 08:10.357
that Muirfield
could've adapted:

08:10.418 --> 08:12.419
uh, sap from sequoias,
thermal bacteria...

08:12.486 --> 08:13.921
Okay, I got a C in science.

08:13.988 --> 08:15.422
What does this have
to do with me?

08:15.489 --> 08:19.126
I need you to ask Vincent
to help catch him.

08:19.194 --> 08:23.129
So you're sending him
on missions now, too?

08:23.197 --> 08:25.364
No. Well, I mean, yeah,
but it's not what you think.

08:25.432 --> 08:27.700
Okay? I don't want Vincent
to kill this beast,

08:27.767 --> 08:28.901
I want him to catch him.

08:28.969 --> 08:30.469
What, so you can
rehabilitate him?

08:30.537 --> 08:33.105
No, so we can try
and save him.

08:33.173 --> 08:34.907
Undo what Muirfield did
to them

08:34.975 --> 08:36.375
just like you undid it for me.

08:36.443 --> 08:38.044
Yeah, but you had to die first.

08:38.111 --> 08:39.477
The beast in me had to die,
which allowed you

08:39.544 --> 08:42.881
to save my human side.
Barely, with a defibrillator.

08:42.948 --> 08:45.583
Look, I wish I could think
of another way, but I can't.

08:45.651 --> 08:47.618
All I know is that
this worked once,

08:47.686 --> 08:50.121
and if we can get it to
work on this beast, too,

08:50.189 --> 08:51.456
then we can use it
to save Vincent.

08:51.523 --> 08:53.158
Isn't that what you want?

08:53.226 --> 08:56.994
Of course, but this is beyond
risky, and you know it.

08:57.062 --> 08:59.296
It is a total long shot.

08:59.364 --> 09:02.499
And besides, if this
doesn't work on Vincent...

09:02.567 --> 09:05.302
Wait... is that what you want?

09:05.370 --> 09:08.472
Come on, Catherine,
you know better than that.

09:08.539 --> 09:11.174
Would I be going through
all this if I did?

09:11.242 --> 09:12.775
I am trying to make amends.

09:12.843 --> 09:14.744
I am trying to stay sane.

09:14.811 --> 09:16.179
Look, I appreciate
everything

09:16.247 --> 09:18.181
that you're trying
to do--

09:18.249 --> 09:22.285
really-- it's just my life
is so out of control right now,

09:22.353 --> 09:26.089
I think I, I just need
to save myself

09:26.156 --> 09:28.357
before I can save anyone else.

09:28.424 --> 09:32.094
Okay, still, the arsonist's
pattern of setting a fire

09:32.161 --> 09:33.929
every 24 hours means

09:33.997 --> 09:35.297
this is our best chance
of capturing another beast.

09:35.365 --> 09:37.465
Which is why we have
to let the arson

09:37.533 --> 09:39.034
investigators do their job.

09:39.102 --> 09:41.669
This is their jurisdiction
and it's their case.

09:41.737 --> 09:43.371
I'm sorry.

10:05.726 --> 10:07.560
Hello?

10:10.398 --> 10:12.032
Anybody home?

10:16.602 --> 10:18.637
Vincent?

10:18.704 --> 10:20.472
You here?

10:32.751 --> 10:36.254
Vincent, hey,
I've been looking for you.

10:36.322 --> 10:37.488
Why?

10:37.556 --> 10:39.223
You don't remember me, do you?

10:39.291 --> 10:40.758
You know Catherine.

10:40.826 --> 10:42.726
Right, I'm her boss,
we're friends.

10:42.794 --> 10:44.728
Doesn't make <i>us</i> friends.

10:46.631 --> 10:48.531
Now you have two seconds

10:48.599 --> 10:50.567
to tell me who you are
and what you want.

10:50.634 --> 10:54.338
I'm Gabe. Lowan?

10:54.405 --> 10:58.442
I tried to kill you
four months ago.

10:58.509 --> 11:00.543
Interesting way of trying
to save your life.

11:00.611 --> 11:02.612
Actually, I'm here
trying to save yours.

11:02.680 --> 11:03.779
I didn't realize
mine needed saving.

11:03.847 --> 11:05.114
Listen to me.

11:05.182 --> 11:08.117
I used to be a beast,
just like you.

11:08.185 --> 11:10.453
And the reason
I tried to kill you

11:10.520 --> 11:12.280
was I thought it was
the only way to save me.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.291
Save you from what?

11:15.359 --> 11:17.293
(choking):
From being a beast.

11:17.361 --> 11:20.028
I couldn't control
it anymore.

11:20.129 --> 11:22.530
I thought you held
the key to saving me

11:22.598 --> 11:23.865
but Catherine,

11:23.932 --> 11:25.867
she found
another way--

11:25.934 --> 11:27.735
a way that could
save you, too.

11:27.803 --> 11:29.237
She sent you here?

11:29.305 --> 11:30.805
No.

11:30.873 --> 11:33.774
Actually, she wasn't overly
interested in the idea.

11:35.543 --> 11:37.277
(clears throat)

11:37.345 --> 11:39.813
Well, at least I know
you're telling the truth.

11:39.881 --> 11:42.582
Look... we don't
have much time.

11:42.650 --> 11:43.984
The only way this
is going to work

11:44.052 --> 11:45.772
is if we test it out
on another beast first,

11:45.820 --> 11:47.388
and that's where
you come in.

11:47.455 --> 11:48.989
And I know
where to find one.

11:49.057 --> 11:51.257
Where?
If I tell you,

11:51.325 --> 11:53.092
you can't kill it.
You have to capture it.

11:53.160 --> 11:54.660
Who says I would kill it?

11:54.728 --> 11:56.462
Look, let's drop the pretense.

11:56.530 --> 11:57.830
We both know
that satphone

11:57.898 --> 11:59.165
isn't for a shipwreck.

11:59.233 --> 12:01.401
Someone's got you
hunting beasts,

12:01.468 --> 12:03.802
but what I'm offering you,
possibly,

12:03.870 --> 12:06.605
is the chance
to be human again.

12:06.673 --> 12:09.107
And if it works,

12:09.175 --> 12:11.295
there'd be nothing standing between
you and Catherine.

12:11.344 --> 12:13.111
Interested?

12:13.179 --> 12:16.114
You're still alive,
aren't you?

12:17.550 --> 12:19.284
Okay, who is it?

12:19.352 --> 12:20.785
The serial arsonist.

12:20.853 --> 12:23.187
He's the Muirfield asset?

12:23.255 --> 12:24.188
Capturing him

12:24.256 --> 12:25.589
is your best chance

12:25.657 --> 12:26.790
at getting Catherine back.

12:29.827 --> 12:31.462
All I care about
is killing it.

12:31.530 --> 12:33.964
What...? Wait.

12:34.032 --> 12:36.100
Vincent.

12:36.168 --> 12:37.668
Vincent!

12:45.842 --> 12:47.843
(subway brakes screech
distantly)

12:47.911 --> 12:49.446
(wheels rattling)

12:55.685 --> 12:57.686
(engine revs, tires screech)

12:57.753 --> 12:59.455
(siren wails)

12:59.522 --> 13:02.491
(indistinct radio communication)

13:03.393 --> 13:06.195
(sirens wailing)

13:06.262 --> 13:07.729
(horn blaring)

13:10.800 --> 13:12.533
(sirens wailing)

13:12.601 --> 13:14.569
(fire crackling)

13:31.219 --> 13:32.885
Who are you?

13:34.122 --> 13:35.854
(laughs)

13:35.922 --> 13:37.389
How did you find me?

13:38.825 --> 13:40.659
You won't like the answer.

13:44.131 --> 13:45.063
(grunts)

13:49.969 --> 13:51.669
So...

13:51.737 --> 13:54.071
they sent one guinea pig
to kill another.

13:54.140 --> 13:55.573
(snarls)

13:55.641 --> 13:56.774
Makes sense.

13:56.842 --> 13:58.009
But it looks like

13:58.076 --> 13:59.877
you got a different cocktail.

13:59.945 --> 14:02.013
(snarls)

14:02.080 --> 14:05.683
I see that you're faster
and stronger, but...

14:05.751 --> 14:07.351
can you do this?

14:16.994 --> 14:18.128
(grunting)

14:20.931 --> 14:22.065
(coughs, gasps for breath)

14:24.601 --> 14:26.869
(exhales)

14:39.719 --> 14:40.852
(fire crackling softly)

14:40.919 --> 14:42.053
(quiet music plays)

14:42.121 --> 14:44.821
Mmm. I think
I found myself.

14:44.889 --> 14:46.290
Right?

14:46.358 --> 14:48.825
I can't believe
how badly I needed this.

14:48.893 --> 14:50.294
Please remind me

14:50.362 --> 14:52.129
to never ignore myself
like that again.

14:52.196 --> 14:53.631
Mmm, count on it.

14:55.900 --> 14:58.569
Do you think the arsonist
could be a beast?

14:58.637 --> 15:00.737
Code!

15:00.804 --> 15:01.738
And what happened to
not mentioning

15:01.805 --> 15:03.038
the V-word for a while?

15:03.106 --> 15:04.807
This is supposed
to be you time, relax!

15:04.875 --> 15:06.643
Okay. Okay.

15:06.710 --> 15:08.244
Relaxing now.

15:09.747 --> 15:11.013
(exhales)

15:13.049 --> 15:14.484
Except...

15:14.551 --> 15:15.850
what if this
flatlining thing

15:15.918 --> 15:17.586
could actually
cure Vincent?

15:17.654 --> 15:19.488
Duh!

15:19.555 --> 15:20.756
Vincent's her dog.

15:20.823 --> 15:23.325
(phone ringing)

15:25.828 --> 15:27.896
(sighs)

15:27.963 --> 15:30.499
(ringing continues)

15:34.336 --> 15:35.903
It's Gabe
calling again.

15:35.970 --> 15:37.538
Maybe I
should ans...

15:37.606 --> 15:38.939
(humming):
Om...

15:39.007 --> 15:42.009
Om...

15:42.076 --> 15:43.678
You're a wreck.
You know that, right?

15:43.745 --> 15:45.513
Yeah, I do.

15:45.580 --> 15:47.714
(sighs)

15:47.782 --> 15:49.882
(phone ringing)

15:49.950 --> 15:52.218
Holy crap. Seriously?

15:52.286 --> 15:54.187
CATHERINE: What, is it Gabe?
No.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.189
(knocking at door)
MAN: Hey, Chandler,

15:56.256 --> 15:58.558
I got Gabe Lowan
calling for you.

15:58.626 --> 16:00.259
Why don't you answer
your own damn phone?

16:01.796 --> 16:02.729
I give up.

16:09.101 --> 16:10.536
GABE:
<i>Dispatch said</i>

16:10.603 --> 16:11.737
they pulled a man
from the building,

16:11.805 --> 16:12.938
so I rushed right over.

16:13.005 --> 16:14.606
Turns out it was Vincent.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.041
Guess you're not the only one
looking for a fight.

16:16.108 --> 16:17.409
We have to get him
out of here.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.477
If someone runs
his fingerprints...

16:18.545 --> 16:19.910
I had him admitted
as a John Doe,

16:19.978 --> 16:21.018
but two arson
investigators

16:21.046 --> 16:22.780
are on their way
to question him,

16:22.848 --> 16:24.915
and they're going to want to
know what he was doing there.

16:24.983 --> 16:26.484
I can't believe Vincent
would be so reckless.

16:26.552 --> 16:27.819
Personally, I don't think

16:27.886 --> 16:29.286
he's handling your
time-out very well.

16:29.355 --> 16:31.055
How do you know?
Because I talked to him.

16:31.122 --> 16:32.623
I'm the one who

16:32.691 --> 16:33.924
turned Vincent on
to the arsonist.

16:33.992 --> 16:35.125
Hey, you're the one
who said that

16:35.193 --> 16:36.473
you didn't want
to help save him.

16:36.527 --> 16:38.127
No, I said I didn't
want to risk it.

16:38.195 --> 16:39.563
That's different.

16:39.630 --> 16:40.930
You could've
got him killed.

16:43.234 --> 16:45.602
(coughing)

16:45.670 --> 16:46.803
Running into a fire?

16:46.871 --> 16:48.004
What were you thinking?

16:48.072 --> 16:49.606
(coughs)

16:49.674 --> 16:51.940
I was thinking about
killing another beast.

16:52.008 --> 16:53.976
It's not like
my missions

16:54.043 --> 16:55.678
are secret anymore,
obviously.

16:55.746 --> 16:57.446
Hey, you ran
out on me.

16:57.514 --> 16:58.848
CATHERINE: This wasn't one of
your missions.

16:58.915 --> 17:01.016
You went on your
own mission and...

17:01.084 --> 17:02.785
and you could've gotten
yourself killed.

17:02.853 --> 17:04.420
You may be
supercharged,

17:04.488 --> 17:05.755
but you're
not invincible.

17:05.821 --> 17:07.922
I'll sound the alarm

17:07.990 --> 17:10.791
when I see
the arson guys.

17:10.859 --> 17:12.594
(coughing)

17:17.599 --> 17:20.134
Look, I'm sorry
to drag you into this.

17:20.202 --> 17:22.470
You know, the last thing
I want to be in your life

17:22.538 --> 17:24.104
is some pain in the ass.

17:24.171 --> 17:26.106
It's too late.

17:28.676 --> 17:30.477
Vincent, it's not that
I don't want you in my life,

17:30.545 --> 17:32.979
it's just that I don't know how
to keep you in it

17:33.047 --> 17:35.181
because I don't
even know

17:35.249 --> 17:36.983
what my life is anymore.

17:37.051 --> 17:40.653
I don't even know who
my real father is now.

17:40.721 --> 17:42.054
It's like...

17:42.122 --> 17:43.523
everything's
up in the air.

17:43.590 --> 17:45.224
And you don't need some guy

17:45.292 --> 17:46.859
who can't tell you the truth
or remember anything.

17:46.927 --> 17:48.360
I get it.

17:48.429 --> 17:49.562
Okay?
Doesn't mean I like it,

17:49.630 --> 17:51.531
but I get it.

17:51.598 --> 17:53.999
Do you want to remember me?

17:55.201 --> 17:56.468
Yeah.

17:57.804 --> 18:00.305
I do,
more than anything.

18:00.372 --> 18:03.007
But since I can't be honest

18:03.075 --> 18:06.044
about these missions with you...

18:06.111 --> 18:08.480
You know, that's why I just,
I want to finish them, okay?

18:08.548 --> 18:10.028
So I don't have
to lie to you anymore.

18:11.483 --> 18:13.484
Catherine, it's the one thing
I can control.

18:13.552 --> 18:15.385
Not if you get
yourself killed.

18:21.993 --> 18:23.561
Excuse me.

18:23.628 --> 18:25.195
A John Doe got admitted
a couple of hours ago.

18:25.263 --> 18:27.331
I need a room number.
Let me check.

18:27.398 --> 18:29.599
Thank you.

18:31.802 --> 18:33.870
ADA Lowan.

18:33.938 --> 18:36.105
Right this way.

18:39.610 --> 18:42.111
Okay, he's in room 2...

18:42.179 --> 18:43.779
GABE:
<i>Here he is.</i>

18:43.847 --> 18:46.515
Although I don't know
how much he remembers.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.183
You the one they
pulled out of the fire?

18:49.586 --> 18:50.519
Yeah.

18:50.587 --> 18:51.753
Tell us your name?

18:53.255 --> 18:54.422
It's Victor.

18:55.358 --> 18:56.525
(stifles a cough)

18:56.593 --> 18:59.027
Okay, Victor.

18:59.095 --> 19:00.394
I'm Charlie, he's Aaron.

19:00.462 --> 19:02.897
We're arson investigators, FDNY.

19:02.965 --> 19:05.199
Need to ask you
a few questions-- you up to it?

19:05.266 --> 19:07.267
Yeah, sure.

19:07.335 --> 19:09.770
CHARLIE:
All right, good.

19:09.838 --> 19:12.306
You see him?

19:12.374 --> 19:14.475
Sorry, fellas. Victor's actually
working undercover

19:14.543 --> 19:16.376
for the DA's Office, so...

19:16.443 --> 19:18.077
Undercover where?

19:18.145 --> 19:19.479
On the fires?

19:19.547 --> 19:21.447
Technically, yeah, but...

19:21.516 --> 19:23.116
Arson's our
jurisdiction.

19:23.183 --> 19:25.485
We're actually working
a different angle.

19:26.353 --> 19:27.821
I got this.

19:27.889 --> 19:29.055
Kid's always chomping
at the bit,

19:29.123 --> 19:30.323
what're you gonna do, right?

19:30.391 --> 19:32.758
Yeah, you see,
the problem is,

19:32.826 --> 19:34.760
uh, serial arsonists,
they have a pattern,

19:34.828 --> 19:36.562
and without knowing it,

19:36.630 --> 19:38.797
we have no way of finding him
before he hits his next target.

19:38.865 --> 19:40.264
Which is why it'd be real
helpful if Victor here

19:40.332 --> 19:41.933
could tell us
what he saw.

19:42.001 --> 19:43.001
Listen, we're trying
to find out the same thing.

19:43.068 --> 19:43.968
Unfortunately,

19:44.036 --> 19:45.136
Victor, he, um...

19:45.203 --> 19:46.470
he hit his head.

19:46.539 --> 19:48.172
He has a little amnesia.

19:48.240 --> 19:50.074
(scoffs)
This is a joke.

19:50.142 --> 19:52.309
Y-You're joking, right?
Hey.

19:52.377 --> 19:53.912
This arsonist killed two
firefighters, all right?

19:53.979 --> 19:56.757
We need to put him in the ground.
Hey. What'd I say?

19:56.758 --> 19:58.092
Look, I don't know
what the hell's going on here,

19:58.093 --> 20:00.297
but we need some answers, you understand?
CHARLIE: Aaron...

20:00.298 --> 20:01.612
And we're not leaving
here until we get 'em!

20:01.637 --> 20:03.283
Aaron. Enough.

20:03.855 --> 20:05.988
Kid's gonna
get himself killed one day.

20:05.989 --> 20:07.269
This is why
I promised his mother

20:07.291 --> 20:08.372
I'd make him
an investigator

20:08.392 --> 20:09.325
instead of let him

20:09.393 --> 20:10.393
go on the front lines.

20:10.460 --> 20:11.393
He's just like his father,

20:11.460 --> 20:12.927
God rest his soul.

20:12.995 --> 20:14.562
He leaps
before he looks.

20:14.630 --> 20:15.664
Like all the Keller boys.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.567
Uh... Aaron Keller?

20:19.635 --> 20:23.371
Any relation
to William, or Vincent?

20:23.439 --> 20:24.572
AARON: Yeah, William
was my father.

20:24.640 --> 20:25.707
He died in Tower Two.

20:25.775 --> 20:28.275
Why? You know him?

20:28.343 --> 20:29.843
CATHERINE: Victor?
VINCENT: <i>Come on, Aaron.</i>

20:29.911 --> 20:31.378
Nice arm there, buddy.

20:31.446 --> 20:33.280
(gasping)
Vi... Victor?

20:36.905 --> 20:37.693
Gabe...

20:37.718 --> 20:39.253
Uh, fellas, I think
he's had enough for one day.

20:39.254 --> 20:40.583
Yeah, but we still
don't know anything.

20:40.622 --> 20:42.289
I said out, now!

20:42.357 --> 20:43.556
All right, all right.
Come on.

20:43.624 --> 20:46.125
(monitor beeping rapidly)

20:46.193 --> 20:47.126
(low growl)

20:48.696 --> 20:50.563
Vincent.
(growls)

20:50.631 --> 20:52.799
Vincent,
can you hear me?

20:52.866 --> 20:54.767
(alarm beeping)

20:59.706 --> 21:01.773
Hey, you gonna try
to catch it this time,

21:01.841 --> 21:02.874
Uncle Vincent,
or what?

21:02.942 --> 21:05.310
Aw, big throw!

21:05.378 --> 21:06.812
Nice job, Aaron.

21:06.879 --> 21:08.413
(Vincent growling,
alarm beeping)

21:09.849 --> 21:11.550
Vincent.

21:11.617 --> 21:13.652
Rooftop's going,
little brother.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.786
we gotta clear
those floors fast.

21:15.854 --> 21:17.814
Okay, I'm right behind you, brother.
Go! Now! Now!

21:19.123 --> 21:21.291
VINCENT:
William, you okay?

21:21.360 --> 21:22.426
Yeah, I'm all right.

21:25.864 --> 21:27.732
Vincent, no!

21:27.799 --> 21:29.299
You take the east side,
I'll take the west.

21:29.368 --> 21:30.501
We'll cover more ground.

21:30.569 --> 21:32.001
No! No splitting up.

21:32.069 --> 21:33.770
(growls)
Vincent.

21:33.838 --> 21:35.505
Okay, just calm down,
all right?

21:35.573 --> 21:37.306
William!

21:39.410 --> 21:40.410
William!

21:42.546 --> 21:44.514
William! William!

21:45.916 --> 21:46.949
(growls)

21:47.017 --> 21:48.517
WILLIAM:
Help!

21:48.585 --> 21:49.418
Will, where are you?

21:49.486 --> 21:50.919
Here!
I'm in here!

21:51.921 --> 21:53.756
Help!
William!

21:55.157 --> 21:56.658
(growling)

21:56.726 --> 21:59.194
(steady tone sounding)

22:02.932 --> 22:05.132
What the... hell?

22:14.472 --> 22:15.606
What?

22:15.674 --> 22:17.274
Where are you?
I'm walking.

22:17.342 --> 22:19.443
Something happened.

22:19.511 --> 22:20.444
I know.

22:20.512 --> 22:22.613
I was at the hospital.

22:22.681 --> 22:25.381
Lucky for both of us,
ADA Lowan covered for you.

22:25.449 --> 22:27.650
Said someone shot at you
because you were

22:27.719 --> 22:28.885
undercover or something?

22:28.953 --> 22:30.887
Anyway, you better
be more careful.

22:30.955 --> 22:33.056
More careful? Oh, you think
I wanted this to happen?

22:33.124 --> 22:35.926
Sir, I had, like, some sort
of memory overload or something.

22:35.993 --> 22:37.928
I had, like,
flashes of my brothers,

22:37.995 --> 22:39.829
my nephew, fires.

22:39.896 --> 22:41.630
I didn't even know, you know?

22:41.698 --> 22:43.298
Okay, Vincent, calm down.
You got to get under control.

22:43.366 --> 22:45.901
That's the point, okay?
I can't control it.

22:45.969 --> 22:48.838
These memories, they just keep
coming and coming.

22:50.907 --> 22:53.008
Just a couple more Muirfield
experiments to take out,

22:53.076 --> 22:55.643
and then you're done... free.

22:55.711 --> 22:57.411
You go back to your old life.

22:57.479 --> 22:59.180
Let the memories come.

22:59.248 --> 23:01.950
But first, you've got
to get your focus back.

23:02.017 --> 23:04.418
Because if you die,
innocent people will die, too.

23:04.486 --> 23:05.686
Believe me.

23:05.755 --> 23:07.789
To that end, I've I.D.'d

23:07.857 --> 23:09.124
the guy you're up against.

23:09.191 --> 23:10.258
Unfortunately,

23:10.325 --> 23:12.192
he's a diagnosed pyromaniac.

23:12.260 --> 23:13.827
Oh, yeah, you think?

23:13.895 --> 23:15.863
Name's Eddie Long.

23:15.930 --> 23:17.664
He's an arsonist
Muirfield lifted

23:17.732 --> 23:18.892
from prison several years ago

23:18.933 --> 23:20.500
to experiment on.

23:20.568 --> 23:22.936
He's also a brilliant
structural engineer,

23:23.004 --> 23:24.371
which is why he knows exactly

23:24.438 --> 23:25.839
how to bring buildings down
with fires.

23:25.907 --> 23:27.206
Oh, and let me guess.

23:27.274 --> 23:28.674
He doesn't get burned

23:28.742 --> 23:30.209
because of whatever
Muirfield did to him.

23:30.277 --> 23:31.978
Exactly, so you gotta
get to him

23:32.045 --> 23:33.545
before he gets
inside a building on fire.

23:33.613 --> 23:35.181
Otherwise he's got
the advantage.

23:35.249 --> 23:37.650
Okay, so I'll track him down.
No.

23:37.717 --> 23:39.551
Let me work on it.
I've got some leads.

23:39.619 --> 23:41.053
Now, in the meantime...

23:41.121 --> 23:43.855
just hang tight, relax.

23:43.923 --> 23:46.158
And steer clear of anything

23:46.225 --> 23:48.160
that might trigger
any of those memories.

23:49.728 --> 23:52.063
(siren blares in the distance)

24:05.277 --> 24:08.179
What are you doing here?

24:08.246 --> 24:09.847
You're kidding, right?

24:09.915 --> 24:11.515
I'm worried about you.

24:11.582 --> 24:13.083
Are you okay? What happened?

24:13.151 --> 24:15.819
I think you should probably go.

24:15.886 --> 24:17.987
Well, too bad. I'm not leaving.

24:18.055 --> 24:19.823
Your nephew triggered memories.

24:19.890 --> 24:21.191
Didn't he?
That's what happened?

24:21.258 --> 24:23.526
Look, I told you, okay?

24:23.593 --> 24:24.760
I don't want to be some pain...

24:24.829 --> 24:26.062
But I want to know.

24:26.130 --> 24:28.097
What did you remember?

24:28.165 --> 24:31.033
The truth.

24:34.737 --> 24:37.772
I'm not sure exactly.

24:37.841 --> 24:40.442
It was all this jumbled...

24:40.509 --> 24:43.245
mess.

24:43.313 --> 24:45.180
I think it was my
brother William.

24:45.248 --> 24:46.581
He's a firefighter?

24:46.649 --> 24:48.615
That's right.

24:48.683 --> 24:52.019
I was, I was afraid that...

24:52.087 --> 24:54.588
I was afraid he was gonna die.

24:54.656 --> 24:56.958
There was this, uh...

24:57.025 --> 24:59.293
three story walk-up
near the projects.

24:59.361 --> 25:01.896
And the fire was chasing pipes,

25:01.964 --> 25:03.964
rising fast,
and we got separated.

25:04.031 --> 25:05.631
I'm sorry, "we"?

25:05.699 --> 25:06.867
Me and William.

25:06.934 --> 25:08.368
We got ordered to do

25:08.435 --> 25:09.569
this primary search.

25:10.838 --> 25:12.272
Because I was a probie,

25:12.340 --> 25:14.474
William didn't want
to leave me...

25:14.541 --> 25:15.375
<i>didn't want to leave me.</i>

25:15.442 --> 25:17.110
Vincent, no!

25:17.178 --> 25:18.411
Okay, wait, you-you were...?

25:18.479 --> 25:20.412
He yells out to me
not to split up.

25:20.480 --> 25:22.314
But I do anyway, and then...

25:22.382 --> 25:23.548
No!

25:23.616 --> 25:25.985
<i>I lose him.</i>

25:26.052 --> 25:27.319
<i>And he went down.</i>
Vincent?

25:28.821 --> 25:30.089
What?

25:30.156 --> 25:31.823
You were a fireman?

25:31.892 --> 25:34.326
Yeah, wasn't I?

25:34.394 --> 25:35.760
I guess.

25:35.827 --> 25:37.561
You didn't mention it before.

25:37.629 --> 25:40.064
But if you're having
memories of it...

25:40.132 --> 25:41.966
You know, how do I even know

25:42.034 --> 25:44.235
what I'm remembering
is the truth?

25:45.804 --> 25:48.506
Because you feel it, too.

25:48.573 --> 25:50.608
Memories aren't just playback.

25:50.675 --> 25:52.409
They trigger emotion.

25:52.476 --> 25:55.678
And emotion doesn't lie,
it's real.

25:55.746 --> 26:00.582
It reveals who you were,
who you are.

26:00.650 --> 26:02.785
Your memories do
the same for you?

26:04.254 --> 26:07.356
I mean, you know, with your dad?

26:07.424 --> 26:10.526
You said before,
you-you weren't sure

26:10.593 --> 26:13.595
whether what you knew
of him was true or not.

26:13.663 --> 26:15.964
So shouldn't your
memories help you

26:16.032 --> 26:18.800
to, you know, find the truth?

26:18.867 --> 26:21.536
Well, isn't that what
you're looking for?

26:21.603 --> 26:26.174
I guess it's
what we're both looking for.

26:26.242 --> 26:28.209
(siren chirps)

26:28.277 --> 26:30.478
Well, I see you
got the med kit.

26:30.546 --> 26:33.314
Who's getting stitched up now?
Possibly Vincent.

26:33.381 --> 26:35.983
Well, not yet. First I need to
test the flatlining procedure

26:36.051 --> 26:38.218
on this arsonist now that
we know he's a beast, too.

26:38.286 --> 26:39.553
Grab me the defibrillator?

26:39.620 --> 26:41.121
It's down the hall.

26:41.189 --> 26:42.556
You know...

26:42.623 --> 26:43.723
I'm not a secretary.
I'm Cat's friend.

26:43.791 --> 26:45.359
I tolerate you.

26:45.427 --> 26:47.893
Look, Catherine's the one
who told me to be ready

26:47.962 --> 26:49.362
in case they found
the arsonist.

26:49.430 --> 26:51.030
She just called.
Oh yeah, right.

26:51.098 --> 26:52.631
Your, uh, flatlining idea.

26:52.699 --> 26:53.732
Well, she's at least willing

26:53.800 --> 26:55.134
to see if it'll work.

26:55.202 --> 26:56.569
And if it does,
and we can help Vincent,

26:56.636 --> 26:58.204
then we need to be ready.

26:58.272 --> 27:00.573
You know, as heroic as this is,

27:00.640 --> 27:02.175
it does hurt your chances

27:02.242 --> 27:03.575
of being with the girl
you've fallen for.

27:03.642 --> 27:05.577
What are you talking about?
Please.

27:05.644 --> 27:07.346
There's only one reason
you'd do all this.

27:07.413 --> 27:08.981
And it's not to make amends.

27:09.048 --> 27:10.382
Look, you believe
what you want.

27:10.450 --> 27:12.417
And whatever my feelings
for Catherine are,

27:12.485 --> 27:13.551
they're irrelevant.

27:13.619 --> 27:14.552
She saved me.

27:14.620 --> 27:15.653
And I owe it to her

27:15.721 --> 27:16.821
to do everything I can

27:16.889 --> 27:18.423
to help save Vincent.

27:24.062 --> 27:26.930
Catherine, wait,
what if he recognizes me?

27:26.999 --> 27:28.765
Yeah, okay, we got away
with it once...

27:28.833 --> 27:30.101
He was six last
time he saw you.

27:30.168 --> 27:31.335
And plus he thinks
you've been dead

27:31.403 --> 27:33.337
for over a decade.

27:33.405 --> 27:36.439
And what if he triggers
another memory in me,

27:36.507 --> 27:37.907
and I can't control it again?

27:37.975 --> 27:39.709
Then I will get you
out of there.

27:39.776 --> 27:41.496
But unfortunately we
don't have much choice.

27:41.512 --> 27:43.213
The investigators are
the ones working

27:43.280 --> 27:44.714
on the arsonist's pattern.

27:44.781 --> 27:46.682
They're our best chance
at finding him.

27:50.021 --> 27:51.520
Between the office buildings
and the residential towers,

27:51.587 --> 27:53.455
that's over 20 buildings
this guy could hit.

27:53.523 --> 27:55.391
And we don't have the manpower
to cover half of them.

27:55.458 --> 27:56.691
AARON: Oh, look
who it is.

27:56.759 --> 27:58.627
Bad cop, mute cop.

27:58.694 --> 27:59.794
Aaron, we're here to help.

27:59.862 --> 28:01.530
What, he get his memory back

28:01.597 --> 28:02.731
all of a sudden?

28:02.798 --> 28:04.366
Is that your father?

28:04.434 --> 28:05.367
William Keller?

28:05.435 --> 28:06.635
Yeah.

28:06.702 --> 28:07.568
Next to one
of my uncles,

28:07.636 --> 28:08.969
Daniel.

28:09.038 --> 28:10.038
Had another uncle, too.

28:10.105 --> 28:11.705
Died in Afghanistan-- Vincent.

28:13.975 --> 28:15.709
You lost a lot.

28:15.777 --> 28:18.312
Yeah, and I don't want
to lose any more.

28:18.380 --> 28:20.148
That's why I want to
get this psycho so bad.

28:20.215 --> 28:22.116
If you're here to help,

28:22.184 --> 28:23.450
we'll take it.

28:23.518 --> 28:24.617
No questions asked.

28:24.685 --> 28:25.818
Come on.

28:25.886 --> 28:27.421
Have you noticed any connections

28:27.488 --> 28:28.955
between the arsonist's
previous attacks?

28:29.023 --> 28:30.223
Uh, just that
all the buildings

28:30.291 --> 28:32.559
are owned by Drew Segan.
Segan Petroleum.

28:32.626 --> 28:34.461
Sounds like our arsonist holds
a grudge against Segan.

28:34.529 --> 28:36.896
Yeah, and he's about to go
public this week with his stock.

28:36.964 --> 28:38.004
The problem is Segan owns,

28:38.066 --> 28:39.432
like, 20 properties.

28:39.499 --> 28:40.499
That's why we
can't narrow down

28:40.567 --> 28:41.733
the arsonist's next target.

28:41.801 --> 28:42.761
Okay, look for buildings

28:42.802 --> 28:43.802
with a structural challenge.

28:43.870 --> 28:45.150
This guy used to be an engineer.

28:45.205 --> 28:46.638
He likes show how smart he is.

28:46.706 --> 28:48.840
Well, that's a big challenge
right there.

28:48.908 --> 28:51.009
Segan corporate headquarters?
Un-huh.

28:51.078 --> 28:52.844
Well, the oil refinery in Jersey

28:52.912 --> 28:54.746
and the stadium look pretty
tempting, too, though.

28:54.814 --> 28:56.581
S-Still, even if it's
not the headquarters,

28:56.648 --> 28:57.915
they're gonna have blueprints

28:57.983 --> 28:59.317
of Segan's other
properties there.

28:59.385 --> 29:01.152
Either way, it helps
narrow down the target.

29:01.220 --> 29:03.088
Hey, stand down.

29:03.155 --> 29:04.915
Nobody's running off
half-cocked on this one.

29:04.923 --> 29:07.758
That's an order.

29:07.826 --> 29:09.127
Where were we?

29:09.195 --> 29:10.595
He's been striking

29:10.662 --> 29:11.962
every 24 hours or so, right?

29:12.029 --> 29:13.730
When was his last attack?

29:13.798 --> 29:15.632
Last night, about this time,
give or take..

29:15.733 --> 29:17.301
CATHERINE: We still have three
buildings to choose from.

29:17.368 --> 29:18.735
VINCENT: Well, we'd better
make our best guess

29:18.803 --> 29:20.704
on his next target
and start planning.

29:20.771 --> 29:22.206
(alarm blaring)

29:22.273 --> 29:23.407
MAN 1:
Ah, four alarm fire!

29:23.475 --> 29:24.874
Segan HQ. Let's roll!

29:24.942 --> 29:26.143
MAN 1: Let's go!
MAN 2: Suit up, suit up!

29:26.211 --> 29:28.177
Keller!
Well, so much for guessing.

29:28.245 --> 29:29.512
Where's Aaron?

29:29.580 --> 29:31.314
Keller!
Where the hell's Keller?!

29:31.381 --> 29:32.848
He's gone there on his own.

29:41.743 --> 29:43.110
All units, I need

29:43.178 --> 29:45.045
a 10-13
on Investigator Keller, stat.

29:45.113 --> 29:46.379
Let me know
if his PASS alarm sounds.

29:46.447 --> 29:48.014
Where the hell's
the deputy chief?

29:48.082 --> 29:50.174
Where're you going?
To find Aaron.

29:50.175 --> 29:51.819
Yeah, what if the arsonist's
already in there?

29:51.820 --> 29:53.586
The building's on fire.
So?

29:53.587 --> 29:56.355
So you don't have
the advantage, remember?

29:56.423 --> 29:58.024
Catherine, my nephew might be
in that building,

29:58.092 --> 30:00.026
Okay? He could die.
You both could die.

30:00.094 --> 30:01.393
And how are you going
to stop the arsonist?

30:01.461 --> 30:03.028
I'll take my chances.

30:03.096 --> 30:05.337
Besides, I might have learned a
thing or two from before.

30:05.397 --> 30:07.465
Vincent.

30:07.533 --> 30:09.201
Don't worry, okay?

30:14.774 --> 30:16.074
Don't worry.

30:35.960 --> 30:36.893
Hands up now!

30:48.572 --> 30:49.338
(yells)

30:49.406 --> 30:50.406
(grunts)

30:57.147 --> 30:58.613
Aaron!

30:58.681 --> 31:01.516
I got here as fast as I could.
Any sign of Vincent?

31:01.584 --> 31:03.185
He already went inside.
Is that everything?

31:03.253 --> 31:05.087
Yeah, you sure you want
to try this out on the arsonist?

31:05.155 --> 31:06.588
We might have to
try it on Vincent,

31:06.656 --> 31:08.222
if he doesn't get out
of there alive.

31:08.290 --> 31:11.025
Come on, we got
to cover the exits.

31:11.093 --> 31:14.295
Aaron!

31:16.364 --> 31:18.866
Aaron?

31:20.836 --> 31:21.769
Back for more?

31:24.172 --> 31:26.773
I thought
that you'd be toast by now.

31:26.841 --> 31:28.741
I guess I'm stubborn like that.

31:28.810 --> 31:31.477
You sure it's me you want?

31:31.545 --> 31:33.079
Or is it

31:33.147 --> 31:34.915
those rich bastards
funding Muirfield,

31:34.982 --> 31:36.216
turning us into these...

31:36.284 --> 31:38.151
freaks?

31:38.219 --> 31:40.886
You were a freak to begin with.

31:40.954 --> 31:44.123
Why do you think
they chose you?

31:44.191 --> 31:46.558
(laughs)

31:50.864 --> 31:53.165
(yells)

31:55.500 --> 31:58.236
(yelling)

32:02.574 --> 32:03.908
(growls)

32:08.914 --> 32:11.448
(alarm whistling)

32:14.719 --> 32:17.787
Aaron!

32:17.856 --> 32:21.290
Aaron, where are you?

32:22.926 --> 32:25.494
(grunts)

32:25.562 --> 32:28.364
Aaron?

32:30.868 --> 32:32.034
(groans)

32:32.102 --> 32:34.536
Vincent, I'm over here!

32:34.604 --> 32:36.637
Will.
I'm in here!

32:37.840 --> 32:40.041
William, where are you?

32:40.109 --> 32:41.943
Over here! I'm here!

32:42.011 --> 32:44.612
William!

32:44.680 --> 32:46.281
William, we got
to get out of here!

32:46.349 --> 32:47.615
Vincent, what the hell
are you doing?

32:47.683 --> 32:49.384
Saving your ass.

32:49.451 --> 32:50.818
(coughing)

32:52.954 --> 32:54.121
WILLIAM:
Vincent?

32:54.189 --> 32:55.122
William?

32:55.190 --> 32:56.523
William...

32:56.591 --> 32:58.658
we got to get you out of here.

32:58.726 --> 33:00.895
Slide your legs out.
You okay?

33:00.962 --> 33:02.196
I can't breathe.

33:02.264 --> 33:03.330
Okay, buddy, come on.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.065
I got you.

33:13.974 --> 33:16.675
Mom would never get over it
if you went out like Dad.

33:16.743 --> 33:18.644
You want to save
lives, that's fine,

33:18.712 --> 33:20.313
but you're going
back to med school,

33:20.381 --> 33:22.581
and that's final.

33:25.484 --> 33:27.485
Any word from your brothers?

33:27.553 --> 33:31.156
They're still trying
to get everyone out.

33:33.793 --> 33:34.659
WILLIAM:
Vincent!

33:34.727 --> 33:37.062
William?

33:37.130 --> 33:38.830
Vincent, I'm right here.

33:38.898 --> 33:41.598
William?

33:46.738 --> 33:49.540
William?

33:55.779 --> 33:57.347
Aaron?

33:57.415 --> 33:58.581
Aaron!

33:58.649 --> 34:00.216
Hey.

34:00.284 --> 34:01.684
Aaron?

34:01.752 --> 34:03.786
(coughs)

34:03.854 --> 34:05.121
You're okay, bud.

34:05.189 --> 34:06.722
Hey.

34:11.161 --> 34:12.594
Come on, I got you.

34:12.661 --> 34:16.065
(groaning)

34:16.132 --> 34:17.366
CATHERINE:
Freeze! Don't move!

34:18.268 --> 34:20.469
Screw you.

34:39.788 --> 34:42.389
(flatline tone)

34:42.458 --> 34:43.723
Come on, come on.

34:46.527 --> 34:47.893
Crank it.

34:53.534 --> 34:54.734
Come on, come on,

34:54.802 --> 34:56.636
come on.
It's not working.

34:56.704 --> 34:57.804
Damn it.

34:59.339 --> 35:02.074
(panting)

35:07.914 --> 35:10.116
(sirens approaching)

35:10.183 --> 35:12.118
(indistinct radio communication)

35:15.187 --> 35:17.188
Come on, buddy. Hey.

35:17.256 --> 35:18.289
You're gonna be okay, all right?

35:18.357 --> 35:20.492
(coughs)

35:21.560 --> 35:23.661
Who are you?

35:23.729 --> 35:26.464
Buddy, I wish I could tell you.

35:26.532 --> 35:28.199
(groaning)

35:28.267 --> 35:30.001
(whistles)

35:30.069 --> 35:32.836
Hey!
Over here, over here.

35:35.740 --> 35:36.806
Hang in there, man.

35:36.874 --> 35:37.874
Hang in there, okay?

35:37.942 --> 35:39.309
Get a stretcher!

35:39.377 --> 35:40.877
I got it.

35:40.945 --> 35:42.046
Oh, kid.

35:42.113 --> 35:43.347
You freaking Keller boys.

35:43.415 --> 35:45.149
You never learn, do you?

35:45.216 --> 35:47.450
Where's the stretcher?

35:47.518 --> 35:49.185
Let's go, let's go!

35:49.253 --> 35:51.787
(sirens continue)

35:51.855 --> 35:53.356
(groans)

35:56.008 --> 35:58.624
PORTER (on TV): The arsonist
was fatally shot by police.

35:58.625 --> 36:00.392
Authorities confirm the suspect,

36:00.393 --> 36:02.628
Edward Long,
was an escaped prisoner

36:02.695 --> 36:06.063
who'd been on the loose
since May of 2006,

36:06.131 --> 36:07.298
after he allegedly broke
out of jail.

36:07.365 --> 36:08.466
I've seen enough.

36:08.534 --> 36:10.167
Wait, aren't you
a little concerned

36:10.235 --> 36:11.915
the press will start
asking more questions?

36:11.937 --> 36:14.204
You know, about how
an escaped prisoner...

36:14.272 --> 36:15.673
I'm more worried about the fact

36:15.741 --> 36:17.141
I wasn't able to save
the arsonist,

36:17.208 --> 36:19.143
which means I may not be able
to save Vincent.

36:20.211 --> 36:21.478
I'm not giving up

36:21.579 --> 36:23.513
until I find a way

36:23.581 --> 36:25.715
That's very noble of you.

36:25.783 --> 36:28.251
What is that,
another subtle crack

36:28.319 --> 36:29.653
about my liking Catherine?

36:29.720 --> 36:31.822
No, I was being genuine.

36:31.889 --> 36:33.890
It's noble.

36:33.958 --> 36:35.892
But you do like her.

36:45.401 --> 36:47.436
Excuse me.

36:47.504 --> 36:49.071
I'm looking for
Detective Chandler?

36:53.241 --> 36:55.076
Hey.

36:55.143 --> 36:56.277
Hey.

36:56.345 --> 36:58.713
I just want to say thank you,

36:58.781 --> 37:00.081
you know,
for everything you did.

37:00.148 --> 37:01.449
You're welcome.

37:01.517 --> 37:02.851
We couldn't have
done it without you.

37:02.918 --> 37:04.919
I just, uh,

37:04.987 --> 37:06.454
I wish that I was the one

37:06.522 --> 37:08.122
that got to pull the trigger,
you know?

37:08.190 --> 37:10.223
No, you don't.

37:10.291 --> 37:11.892
It's not your job.

37:11.960 --> 37:13.393
It's my job.

37:18.165 --> 37:19.733
Pretty sure
this belongs to you.

37:19.801 --> 37:21.869
I found it
in the parking garage.

37:21.936 --> 37:23.570
You never should have tried

37:23.638 --> 37:25.404
to handle it by yourself.

37:25.472 --> 37:28.207
Just be more careful
from now on.

37:28.274 --> 37:31.544
We can't afford to lose
any more Kellers.

37:31.612 --> 37:34.213
I guess it's in the blood, huh?

37:34.280 --> 37:36.215
Being stubborn?

37:36.282 --> 37:39.051
And heroic.

37:41.220 --> 37:43.889
Hey, is there any chance I could
ever talk to your partner?

37:43.956 --> 37:46.090
Why?

37:46.158 --> 37:47.959
Just to, you know,

37:48.027 --> 37:50.161
thank him for saving my life.

37:50.229 --> 37:52.831
I don't suppose

37:52.899 --> 37:54.298
that's gonna happen, is it?

37:54.366 --> 37:56.467
He's, uh, he's undercover.

37:56.535 --> 37:58.135
I'm sorry.

37:58.202 --> 38:00.270
Well, uh,

38:00.338 --> 38:02.239
take care.

You first.

38:23.826 --> 38:26.128
Oh, I don't know.
I guess, uh,

38:26.196 --> 38:30.265
I was thinking about how I
said I needed space from you.

38:30.332 --> 38:31.766
(chuckles)

38:31.833 --> 38:34.635
Well, it's amazing
what a little honesty

38:34.703 --> 38:36.604
and a few memories
can accomplish, huh?

38:36.672 --> 38:39.840
I still can't imagine
what it must be like

38:39.908 --> 38:41.776
to not remember who you were

38:41.843 --> 38:43.945
and then suddenly start
remembering things,

38:44.012 --> 38:45.279
painful things.

38:45.346 --> 38:47.514
Well, it's strange,

38:47.582 --> 38:49.816
a little confusing,

38:49.884 --> 38:53.619
and, uh, it's good.

38:53.687 --> 38:54.653
Good how?

38:54.721 --> 38:55.721
I don't know--

38:55.789 --> 38:57.190
like you said before,

38:57.257 --> 38:59.292
it's who I am,
it's the truth.

38:59.359 --> 39:03.062
That doesn't mean it's not
painful sometimes, right?

39:03.130 --> 39:05.631
For both of us.

39:05.699 --> 39:08.167
But what matters is that

39:08.235 --> 39:10.635
you're starting
to remember again.

39:10.703 --> 39:13.538
You, us, and that is good.

39:13.606 --> 39:15.807
I just wish
I could remember more.

39:15.874 --> 39:17.909
You will-- just have
to be patient.

39:17.977 --> 39:19.811
Besides, you're starting
to remember things

39:19.878 --> 39:21.879
that I didn't even
know about you.

39:21.947 --> 39:23.215
Like what?

39:23.282 --> 39:25.416
Like, uh, apparently,
you used to be a fireman

39:25.484 --> 39:27.184
before you went to med school.

39:27.252 --> 39:29.320

of losing all of us.

40:10.360 --> 40:12.794
I wonder if that's
why you enlisted.

40:12.862 --> 40:15.929
To pick up where they left off.

40:15.997 --> 40:17.798
Help people.

40:17.866 --> 40:19.800
Maybe.

40:19.868 --> 40:22.537
On the other hand,

40:22.604 --> 40:24.305
if I just would've stuck,

40:24.373 --> 40:25.640
you know, not let my brothers

40:25.707 --> 40:27.408
talk me out of being
a firefighter,

40:27.476 --> 40:29.942
I don't know,
maybe I could've saved them.

40:30.010 --> 40:31.944
Or you could've died, too.

40:32.012 --> 40:33.580
And you wouldn't have been able

40:33.648 --> 40:35.715
to save your nephew.

40:35.783 --> 40:38.385
Vincent,
we can't change the past,

40:38.452 --> 40:40.287
as much as we both
may want to.

40:40.354 --> 40:42.556
The best we can do

40:42.623 --> 40:45.124
is remember it,

40:45.192 --> 40:47.426
learn from it
and move forward.

40:47.494 --> 40:50.062
Hopefully together.
