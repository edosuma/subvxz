10:28.170 --> 10:30.957
JOE: Had my buddy Todd, here,
mock us up a simulation.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.505
TODD: How'd that one I sent you
yesterday work out?

10:34.009 --> 10:35.670
Pretty hot, right?

10:36.094 --> 10:37.129
Yeah, it was very impressive.

10:37.805 --> 10:40.842
You know, specifically
the technology...

10:40.933 --> 10:42.139
-Right.
-...aspect.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.057
It wasn't sexual. What?

10:44.144 --> 10:45.930
You was gettin' jiggy
on your couch last night, Joseph?

10:46.021 --> 10:47.636
Put your fucking headset on, huh?

10:47.731 --> 10:48.811
Jesus. Wow.

10:49.274 --> 10:50.525
Nothing but business, man.

10:50.943 --> 10:52.274
Wow. Oh, shit,

10:52.361 --> 10:54.022
those are big fucking linebackers.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.443
I always wanted to know
what it was like to play quarterback.

10:55.531 --> 10:57.237
Shit, I'm going Cam Newton
on these motherfuckers.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.531
Holy shit, they're bigger
than normal line...

11:01.328 --> 11:02.363
Fuck this!

11:02.704 --> 11:04.444
Oh! Jesus Christ!

11:06.542 --> 11:07.577
Oh, fuck!

11:07.793 --> 11:09.158
(MUSIC PLAYING)

11:09.253 --> 11:11.244
Fuck you. Fuck you.

11:11.755 --> 11:12.790
No way.

11:15.092 --> 11:16.127
Whew.

11:16.218 --> 11:17.549
No way. Hoo-hoo!

11:17.886 --> 11:19.342
Oh, fuck. That's six, baby.

11:19.429 --> 11:20.555
-Joe.
-Fuck!

11:20.806 --> 11:24.799
Uh! Uh! Touchdown. Have some. Hoo!

11:24.893 --> 11:26.429
Man, you did your thing on these, man.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.011
-We are revolutionizing the game.
-Yeah.

11:29.439 --> 11:33.057
Cannabinoids were a great cause,
Vern, but weed is weed, you know?

11:33.151 --> 11:36.609
Endorsing any product tied to it
is gonna put your money at risk.

11:36.822 --> 11:38.107
If you get suspended,

11:38.198 --> 11:40.575
it's gonna cost you
tens of millions of dollars.

11:40.659 --> 11:44.151
And if you get cut, fuck it,
it's gonna cost you way more.

11:44.538 --> 11:46.449
Yeah, we could have
just as much impact

11:46.540 --> 11:48.701
on the future of football
with this VR thing, man.

11:48.792 --> 11:51.909
Yeah, this is changing the way
people prepare and play.

11:52.004 --> 11:54.586
Everyone's gonna want
a piece of this technology.

11:54.673 --> 11:55.879
And I got you the biggest slice.

11:55.966 --> 11:59.675
TODD: You'll be on every billboard,
poster, and commercial we got.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.423
That's what the hell
I'm talking about, Toddy.

12:02.514 --> 12:04.300
-Okay, I'm in.
-Yeah!

12:04.391 --> 12:07.508
Is it... urn, now, can we each
get a sex tape like Joe?

12:07.936 --> 12:08.971
Good point.

12:14.693 --> 12:16.854
-Hello?
-JULIE: Hi, Mr. Siefert.

12:16.945 --> 12:18.981
lt’s Julie Greane, Char/es’ wife.

12:21.617 --> 12:23.608
I’m so sorry about this FaceTime.

12:23.702 --> 12:26.239
-/ hit the wrong button.
-Happens to me all the time.

12:26.330 --> 12:28.195
Well, the reason I was calling

12:28.290 --> 12:31.373
is, I wanted to invite you
to dinner at our house tonight.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.492
Oh, well, that’s kind of you,
Ms. Greane.

12:33.587 --> 12:35.748
But I'm really buried
at work these days.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.504
Oh, come on,
/ know you’re mad busy,

12:37.591 --> 12:39.456
but a hard-working man needs to eat.

12:39.551 --> 12:41.633
Plus, Charles has been
singing your praises all year

12:41.720 --> 12:44.757
and I need to meet this man
he holds in such high regard.

12:44.848 --> 12:47.430
Plus, my beef brisket is no joke.

12:48.185 --> 12:51.143
Now, don ’t go boasting about
some brisket if you can’t back it up.

12:51.229 --> 12:53.060
A Southern man has a palate
for such things.

12:53.148 --> 12:54.979
Well, then, I guess
you gonna have to get your behind

12:55.067 --> 12:57.023
over here at 7:00
and find out for yourself.

12:58.153 --> 12:59.939
I’ll see you then. Bye.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.948
Bret, we're so close, man.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.988
We got, Bossman's gonna deliver
the owners

13:04.076 --> 13:05.486
and Wayne's already fully committed.

13:05.577 --> 13:07.033
No, he needs to be committed,

13:07.120 --> 13:09.702
that walking pile of oozing jism.

13:09.790 --> 13:13.829
Until he starts thinking
practically, provides land for parking,

13:13.919 --> 13:18.288
for a practice facility,
and hotel space for real fans,

13:18.382 --> 13:21.465
how the fuck am I supposed to take
anything he says seriously?

13:21.551 --> 13:24.793
Craft cocktails and gourmet food?
What the fuck?

13:24.888 --> 13:26.469
What does he think this is,
fucking polo?

13:26.556 --> 13:28.421
SPENCER: Brett, he's fucking with us.

13:28.517 --> 13:29.927
Well, frankly, I don't have a need

13:30.018 --> 13:32.225
for either one of those pompous pricks.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.848
Okay, well, we can't pull out now.

13:33.939 --> 13:36.146
Coming from a 42-year-old man
who's childless,

13:36.233 --> 13:37.268
I'm surprised to hear you say that.

13:37.359 --> 13:38.895
Hey, it's none of your fucking business.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.476
You can mock what I do in here
all you want,

13:40.570 --> 13:42.731
but you don't know shit about me
outside these fucking walls.

13:43.281 --> 13:44.316
Touchy.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.027
Let's do this, okay?

13:51.623 --> 13:54.456
Let's plant our ASM flag
right in Wayne's ass.

13:54.543 --> 13:57.660
A casino, Spencer,
that was my original goal.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.210
To crack the casino business.

13:59.297 --> 14:02.755
That's why I chased after
Wayne's jismo father all those years.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.755
The idea of moving
a football franchise to Las Vegas

14:05.846 --> 14:08.337
has been one giant circle jerk
right from the start.

14:08.849 --> 14:09.884
And given your track record,

14:09.975 --> 14:11.385
I'm guessing the league
would rather have

14:11.476 --> 14:13.967
the face of the devil
on this deal than you.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.349
I've been smeared before,
let me tell you something,

14:16.440 --> 14:17.896
you get over that shit pretty quickly.

14:18.483 --> 14:20.815
No one else has been able
to make this deal happen, Spencer,

14:20.902 --> 14:22.358
what makes you think you can?

14:22.988 --> 14:24.023
Because I got you.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.859
Wayne's treating you
like a second-class businessman

14:26.950 --> 14:29.657
when we both know that you have
the reach to raise the money.

14:29.745 --> 14:32.031
But you can't run around here
acting all butt hurtjust because

14:32.122 --> 14:34.329
he insulted your integrity. Fuck him.

14:34.416 --> 14:36.623
He only said that
because he doesn't have any.

14:36.710 --> 14:37.916
You feel me?

14:38.670 --> 14:41.286
Yeah, I... Ifeel you.

14:42.132 --> 14:43.588
I mean, I feel you.

14:43.675 --> 14:44.755
What do you mean? Do I understand?

14:44.843 --> 14:46.208
Yeah, I... I understand.

14:46.678 --> 14:48.009
Myjive game's a little weak.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.261
Okay, well, it's getting better.

14:50.348 --> 14:51.383
Okay.

14:51.975 --> 14:53.010
One hundred.

14:54.269 --> 14:56.055
One hundred. Harder.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.057
-Practice hurt, dawg.
-(DOOR BELL RINGS)

14:58.148 --> 14:59.513
Come get you some. Mm.

14:59.608 --> 15:02.099
-Every practice makes perfect.
-Okay. Okay.

15:07.699 --> 15:08.859
VERNON: Can I help you?

15:09.242 --> 15:11.153
You can piss
in this cup for me.

15:12.329 --> 15:13.489
You want me to sign it first?

15:13.580 --> 15:14.660
The league sent me.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.238
Medical director wants
to test for marijuana.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.416
I don't smoke marijuana.

15:19.503 --> 15:21.118
Then that's what I'm here to prove.

15:21.213 --> 15:23.420
And, uh, who the fuck is this?

15:23.757 --> 15:24.963
The piss man.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.086
Unannounced?

15:27.177 --> 15:29.213
League's supposed to give us
some kind of heads up.

15:29.346 --> 15:30.756
This is your heads up.

15:30.847 --> 15:32.257
If you don't comply,
it's considered a fail.

15:35.227 --> 15:37.843
Okay. Well, then, uh,
just give us, you know,

15:37.938 --> 15:39.599
15 minutes, you know, to tidy up

15:39.689 --> 15:41.350
'cause the housekeeper on vacay.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.476
You know how that is.

15:42.567 --> 15:43.602
We'll be right back. Thank you.

15:43.693 --> 15:44.853
Appreciate it.

15:46.488 --> 15:47.944
Oh, shit.

15:48.824 --> 15:49.859
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING)

15:51.993 --> 15:53.073
Don't let him see nothing.

15:53.411 --> 15:54.537
Behind you, chief.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.917
VERNON: He's here right now.

16:07.008 --> 16:08.043
SPENCER: God damn it.

16:08.135 --> 16:09.966
You know, the CBA is supposed
to give us 24 hours’ notice.

16:10.053 --> 16:11.088
It's no big deal.

16:11.179 --> 16:12.919
I ain't been smoking,
just taking cannabinoids.

16:13.682 --> 16:15.297
Vernon, it is a big deal.

16:15.392 --> 16:17.678
Your test is gonna come back positive,
do you understand?

16:17.769 --> 16:19.930
But I ain't been getting high.
It's for my recovery.

16:20.021 --> 16:21.056
It doesn’t matter. Okay.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.308
/ want you
to listen to me, Vernon.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.474
I want you to stall him
and do not give that motherfucker

16:25.569 --> 16:27.480
one drop of your piss
until you hear from me.

16:27.571 --> 16:29.482
-Do you understand?
-VERNON: Okay, Spence.

16:31.199 --> 16:32.359
Fuck!

16:36.288 --> 16:37.994
What the fuck?

16:38.415 --> 16:39.655
Sizz, listen,

16:39.749 --> 16:41.831
the intimidation thing
might work on the field,

16:41.918 --> 16:45.126
but I'm your financial manager,
not Andy fucking Dalton.

16:45.422 --> 16:48.164
You are not selling
your Apple stock

16:48.258 --> 16:50.465
because you had a bad
Garden of Eden dream.

16:50.552 --> 16:51.667
That’s ridiculous.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.342
Look, I'm gonna rip
your fucking dick off

16:53.430 --> 16:55.341
and shove it up your fucking ass,
motherfucker!

16:55.473 --> 16:57.009
Do what the fuck I tell you!

16:57.100 --> 16:58.385
My dream's got meaning, bitch!

16:58.643 --> 16:59.758
Oh. All right,

16:59.853 --> 17:02.560
we'll get that transaction going
right away, Mr. Suggs.

17:02.647 --> 17:04.228
Thank you so much for calling.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.393
SPENCER: How's Sizz?

17:06.484 --> 17:07.644
His dreams have meaning.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.230
What's up?

17:09.321 --> 17:10.401
Piss man's at Vernon's house.

17:10.530 --> 17:11.815
But I thought Bossman was cool.

17:11.907 --> 17:13.568
It's not the team,
it's the fucking league.

17:13.658 --> 17:14.738
Oh!

17:15.035 --> 17:17.151
We just severed ties
with High Powered.

17:17.245 --> 17:18.951
I made this great investment deal

17:19.039 --> 17:20.620
with this virtual reality company.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.073
This fucking technology
is incredible.

17:23.168 --> 17:24.908
They mocked me up this three way

17:25.003 --> 17:27.619
with me and two Margot Robbies.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.796
Which reminds me, by the way,
I'll be leaving work early today.

17:29.883 --> 17:32.169
You know what? Uh...
Don't give a shit about that right now.

17:32.260 --> 17:33.761
Is this the tier one company
you're telling me about?

17:33.845 --> 17:36.507
Yeah. Yeah, the kid's a genius.
I've never seen anything like that.

17:36.598 --> 17:38.839
How long do you think it'll take him
to mock up a simulation?

17:39.100 --> 17:40.636
Depends on what you want.
I don't know.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.012
Uh, two, three days,
if you're in a hurry.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.388
Okay, great.
Can you get a meeting today?

17:43.480 --> 17:45.311
-I got ajob for him.
-Yeah, sure.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.808
What's this got to do
with Vern's situation?

17:46.900 --> 17:47.935
It doesn't.

17:48.610 --> 17:50.146
Virginia, call Candace Brewer

17:50.237 --> 17:52.273
and tell her I wanna talk
to her right fucking now.

17:52.364 --> 17:53.399
I'm on it.

17:53.490 --> 17:56.027
And I'll be sure not to use
those exact words.

Charles, you lost?

18:11.091 --> 18:14.583
No. Ijust came down to invite you
over to the house tonight for dinner.

18:14.678 --> 18:16.384
Really? What's the occasion?

18:16.471 --> 18:19.258
The occasion is to get you and Siefert
together and squash the beef

18:19.349 --> 18:21.055
and hopefully get Kisan Teague
in our backfield.

18:21.142 --> 18:22.222
-Real|y?
-CHARLES: Yeah.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.596
You come down, to interrupt my workout,

18:24.688 --> 18:26.849
trying to get me to come
hang outwith my sworn enemy? Really?

18:26.940 --> 18:29.101
-That's what you want me doing?
-Sorry, Freddie.

18:29.192 --> 18:30.477
Look, man, just trust me on this one.

18:30.568 --> 18:32.308
My wife's cooking,
it's got magical powers.

18:32.404 --> 18:34.019
Changed my mind about
all sorts of things,

18:34.114 --> 18:36.776
from marriage, fatherhood, retirement.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.276
You remember
when I was messed up about retirement?

18:38.368 --> 18:39.653
-FREDDIE: Uh, huh.
-Dieting.

18:39.911 --> 18:41.151
Dieting?

18:41.997 --> 18:43.862
-It's not working.
-It's not working, buddy.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.288
Yeah, you come over
and eat that brisket,

18:45.375 --> 18:46.410
you'll find out why.

18:46.501 --> 18:48.787
Charles, lwill gladly
get down on my knees

18:48.878 --> 18:50.834
and eat human shit to sign Kisan,

18:50.922 --> 18:54.005
but you and me both know Siefert,
he don't leave his office

18:54.092 --> 18:56.799
and I know my presence
ain't the main draw.

18:56.886 --> 18:59.138

after my workout.

I mean, if you don't mind me asking.

19:21.619 --> 19:24.577
Seems kind of fucked up
staring at dongs all day.

19:24.789 --> 19:28.077
Quit stalling and break out
the rod and tackle.

19:40.764 --> 19:43.005
I know what you're thinking,
big man, little dick?

19:43.558 --> 19:45.594

19:49.064 --> 19:51.430
Yeah, little Vern only comes out
his shell for the ladies.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.823

your lovely wife is in the other room.

20:10.919 --> 20:12.284
I don't like being ambushed.

20:12.670 --> 20:15.161
Well, I don't like having
my OC fired behind my back.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.793
Well, I don't like you benching
our most promising prospect.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.591
Would that be the prospect
you stole credit for from Charles?

20:22.013 --> 20:23.048
Come on, guys.

20:23.139 --> 20:24.424
We're all on the same team now.

20:24.516 --> 20:26.848
Let's put that stuff behind us.
Where is my wife?

20:26.935 --> 20:29.847
-Hey, there she is.
-Hi! Here it is, guys.

20:30.146 --> 20:32.011
Thanks for the wine, hon.

20:32.107 --> 20:34.223
Off to a fast start. I like that.

20:34.943 --> 20:36.433
All right, guys,
let's say some grace.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.571
Bless us, 0 Lord and these,
Thy gifts,

20:42.659 --> 20:44.570
which we are about to receive
from Thy bounty.

20:44.661 --> 20:46.993
-Through Christ, our Lord. Amen.
-ALL: Amen.

20:48.039 --> 20:50.416
And, sweet baby Jesus,
please shine thy grace

20:50.500 --> 20:52.411
on these two proud, strong men,

20:52.502 --> 20:55.665
and light the path to forgiveness,
understanding, and love.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.545
Mm! That's terrific!

21:04.639 --> 21:06.095
Thank you. Thank you, coach.

21:06.182 --> 21:08.047
You didn't say "Amen," Coach.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.097
-Amen.
-That doesn't count.

21:11.187 --> 21:12.222
You already started eating.

21:12.313 --> 21:13.519

21:14.732 --> 21:15.983
We only go to church on the holidays,

21:16.067 --> 21:17.477
so it's all good.

Billy fucking Graham?

21:22.449 --> 21:24.280
Amen. There. You got two.

-I want you to mean it.
-I can't mean it.

I can only say it. A-fucking-men.

-CHARLES: Hey, that's enough.

-I'm not gonna leave, Charles.
-Yeah, get your ass home.

-Get outta here.
-COACH: Get up. Get up. Come on.

21:39.716 --> 21:40.876

-You want to know what I'm gonna do?

-You look pretty good, man.
-Look out, number 18,

22:05.241 --> 22:08.199
he is rushing up the ﬁeld
and he is brought down from behind.

22:09.162 --> 22:12.120
With a challenging one-handed grab, 18.

22:12.207 --> 22:14.664
Beautiful catch by Ricky Jerret.

22:16.628 --> 22:18.084
Perfect timing.

22:18.171 --> 22:19.377
Went up there with one hand.

22:19.464 --> 22:22.547
Not only an amazing catch,
but he took the hit

22:22.634 --> 22:24.499
and he held on to the football.

22:24.594 --> 22:25.629
Ricky Jerret.

22:26.054 --> 22:29.546
First season with the Patriots,
proving himself.

22:40.401 --> 22:42.528
It's in complete violation,
of his player rights

22:42.612 --> 22:44.944
and we could easilyjust call the NFLPA.

22:45.031 --> 22:48.489
The piss man left several messages
that were never returned.

22:48.660 --> 22:50.571
Had no choice
but to show up at his door.

22:50.828 --> 22:51.988
You know that's not true.

22:52.121 --> 22:55.249
You know, it's a shame to see
a good guy make such bad decisions.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.242
He didn't even know
that taking CBDs was against the rules.

22:58.336 --> 23:00.702
-Come on.
-Sometimes mistakes need to be punished

23:00.797 --> 23:02.537
to prevent them from happening again.

23:03.007 --> 23:05.623
Okay, we have completely severed ties
with that company.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.629
And the truth is Vernon
doesn't even smoke weed.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.676
Then he has nothing to be
worried about going forward.

23:10.473 --> 23:11.508
God damn,
you know how fucking pissed

23:11.599 --> 23:12.839

23:12.934 --> 23:14.299
Oh, I've spoken with Bossman.

23:14.394 --> 23:16.259
He knows I'm just
enforcing league policy.

23:16.354 --> 23:19.061
And quite frankly,
taking a meeting with you

23:19.148 --> 23:21.764
about Littelfield's drug test
is beneath my pay grade.

23:21.859 --> 23:24.475
But leveraging my clients
against my Vegas deal isn't?

23:24.696 --> 23:27.813
Now you sound like
a conspiracy theorist, Spencer.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.772
Why don't you get back
to doing yourjob?

23:30.034 --> 23:32.741
The job that we
and the NFLPA approved you to do

23:32.829 --> 23:34.911
which is managing players' finances

23:35.206 --> 23:39.040
not facilitating a billion-dollar
stadium deal and franchise move.

23:40.128 --> 23:41.413
Okay...

23:41.504 --> 23:43.711
If I stop, you're gonna
call off Vernon's test?

23:43.881 --> 23:45.166
It's too late for that.

23:45.717 --> 23:49.050
But when his test
inevitably comes back positive

23:49.137 --> 23:52.675
whether he's been pulling bong rips
or taking CBDs

23:53.224 --> 23:56.967
I will give him the minimum Stage Two
suspension of four games.

23:57.061 --> 23:59.473
Four fucking games?
Give me a fucking break.

23:59.564 --> 24:02.351
I could just as easily bump it
to Stage Three and make it 10

24:02.442 --> 24:03.522
or a whole season.

24:04.444 --> 24:05.479
