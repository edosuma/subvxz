about the way you look,

I think
you went popstar with it.

I think the issue with
the vocals, it was like,

26:37.796 --> 26:40.265
we lost you until you
started going up into

26:40.332 --> 26:42.000
your upper range,
and then you came to life.

26:42.067 --> 26:44.803

more of what you think

26:44.869 --> 26:47.405
we need to hear into the song.

You're here on this stage,

more than that, Juju.

that wasn't a ballad.
