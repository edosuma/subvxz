Welcome to
How to Throw a Punch Like a Real Man.

00:15.223 --> 00:17.851
Step one: absorb the energy
from the earth.

00:17.976 --> 00:19.477
You throw the jab.

00:20.937 --> 00:22.897
We're throwing the punch
with the right hand.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.525
This is great for jabs.

00:26.901 --> 00:28.486
Oh, shit.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.864
["Eye of the Tiger" by Survivor plays]

00:36.953 --> 00:37.871
Oh, yeah!

00:44.127 --> 00:44.961
Ouch!

00:45.462 --> 00:46.296
Stop!

00:49.007 --> 00:50.133
[sighs]

00:50.258 --> 00:51.092
Shit.

01:24.292 --> 01:25.668
Yeah! Yeah!

01:26.169 --> 01:28.630
Woo!

01:28.713 --> 01:29.631
I don't know, man.

01:30.381 --> 01:31.382
I'd just let it go.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.551
I mean you two didn't even date
for that long.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.053
Honestly,

01:35.178 --> 01:36.429
she seemed pretty nuts.

01:37.639 --> 01:38.598
I'd just walk away.

01:39.015 --> 01:39.849
You know what?

01:41.017 --> 01:42.352
-You're right.
-I am.

01:42.435 --> 01:43.603
-Thank you.
-No problem.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.438
-I just needed to hear that.
-Yeah.

01:46.231 --> 01:49.067
I am fully letting it go.

01:49.150 --> 01:50.401
-Cheers to that.
-Cheers.

01:52.654 --> 01:53.488
Hey, man.

01:54.405 --> 01:55.240
What's this?

01:55.990 --> 01:56.825
I don't know.

01:58.618 --> 02:00.495
[Eye of the Tiger by Survivor plays]

02:12.257 --> 02:13.758
Oh. Oh...

02:13.842 --> 02:15.009
Hi, hey.

02:16.427 --> 02:17.679
[Sam chuckles]

02:17.762 --> 02:19.013
-If you would.
-Thanks.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.057
This is...

02:21.599 --> 02:23.101
-Nice.
-Thanks.

02:24.227 --> 02:25.436
[Jon clears throat]

02:25.520 --> 02:27.063
Thank you for coming. [chuckles]

02:27.147 --> 02:30.567
-Of course.
- How was your fourth of July?

02:30.733 --> 02:31.943
Yeah, it was fine.

02:33.069 --> 02:35.071
The kids said they had a great time
in Connecticut.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.322
Oh, yeah, they seemed to.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.783
We, uh, we went to the parade.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.493
They got ice cream.

02:40.743 --> 02:42.453
You and I should get back together

02:42.537 --> 02:43.955
for the sake of the family.

02:44.414 --> 02:45.248
Excuse me?

02:45.331 --> 02:46.249
Look.

02:47.208 --> 02:48.042
Sam.

02:49.627 --> 02:52.172
I've been through this before.
I don't want to go through it again.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.132
I want to keep our family intact.

02:54.215 --> 02:55.049
But, I--

02:55.133 --> 02:57.218
You're the one who asked for the divorce.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.680
People say all kinds of crazy things,

03:00.763 --> 03:03.391
when they are in excruciating pain.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.435
But, I... [sighs]

03:05.685 --> 03:08.521
I mean, you seem really angry.

03:08.688 --> 03:11.024
No? You left that crazy voicemail.

03:11.107 --> 03:12.984
Oh, no. I... I thought--

03:14.152 --> 03:17.322
I thought you might bring that up
and I have the solution.

03:17.655 --> 03:19.115
Here. Wait, uh...

03:20.074 --> 03:21.117
Wait. You wait.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.035
[playing from device]  Hi, there.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.078
It's me again, Jon Sperling.

03:24.787 --> 03:27.373
We spoke last month,
when I wasn't at my best.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.542
My wife Samantha Delmonico--

03:29.626 --> 03:33.046
-No, no, no. That is not the solution.
-You sure you don't want to hear the rest?

03:33.129 --> 03:35.006
-Because I say some really great stuff.
-No more recordings.

03:35.089 --> 03:37.091
-No more messages.
-Okay. Alright, alright.

03:37.675 --> 03:39.969
Uh, okay... [chuckles]

03:41.471 --> 03:43.806
Jon, where is this coming from?

03:43.890 --> 03:45.850
I thought you were dating Dashiell's
teacher.

03:45.934 --> 03:49.479
Ms. Chelsea and I are all done.
She got back together with Coach Keith.

03:50.396 --> 03:51.356
Alright. But I--

03:52.565 --> 03:55.276
I mean, you made it very clear
that you can never forgive me.

03:55.360 --> 03:59.948
Well, it's going to take me some time,
but I will get there.

04:00.031 --> 04:02.825
-Jon, come on.
-Now, seriously, Sam,

04:02.951 --> 04:04.535
I know that you and Ethan,

04:04.786 --> 04:07.956
you know, you have a thing,
and you think you're in love,

04:08.039 --> 04:09.999
but I don't even know how to think.

04:10.083 --> 04:13.836
I don't think. I just know. We just fit.
We're like a partnership. Just...

04:15.505 --> 04:16.381
[whispers] Right?

04:16.464 --> 04:20.426
I mean, I am committed to being
a good mother no matter what happens.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.889
But an unhappy family
is the worst thing for them.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.766
-What if we have another kid?
-What?

04:27.350 --> 04:28.935
How is that gonna fix anything?

04:29.018 --> 04:31.271
Well it could just... something to do.

04:31.354 --> 04:34.649
Look, Sam,
I let my first family be torn apart.

04:35.566 --> 04:36.484
I will do anything

04:36.901 --> 04:38.903
to keep that from happening to this one.

04:39.779 --> 04:40.613
Anything.

04:47.578 --> 04:49.080
-[Ethan] Yo, yo!
-Hello.

04:49.247 --> 04:50.081
-Hi.
-Hey.

04:50.248 --> 04:53.751
I'm sorry I didn't get you the pages.
I want to get them just right for you.

04:53.835 --> 04:56.129
I'm just kind of finessing
the last 50 or so.

04:56.212 --> 04:59.257
-And my printer is on the fritz   anyway.
-I mean you can email them.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.718
-[scoffs] Tell that to my router.
-Whatever, man. Whatever.

05:01.801 --> 05:04.095
Your pages are my pages.
My pages are your pages.

05:04.178 --> 05:06.973
-Who cares? Let's get it done.
-Good, yeah. Let's get notes.

05:07.348 --> 05:12.520
[man] I don't feel the depth and longing
that I'm craving from Prince Trotter.

05:12.603 --> 05:14.355
Totally, totally. I get it.

05:14.605 --> 05:16.733
You got to go deeper on Trotter, that's...

05:16.899 --> 05:18.276
that's great, that's great.

05:18.651 --> 05:21.863
And why did he throw everything away
to chase the Golden Trumpet?

05:23.614 --> 05:25.992
You know what I just realized?

05:28.244 --> 05:31.873
I don't care about the Golden Trumpet.
I can't chase it anymore.

05:32.248 --> 05:34.167
But how else would he win the hand
of Lady Canter?

05:34.334 --> 05:36.919
I mean I don't care about centaurs

05:37.003 --> 05:38.671
or this book,

05:38.755 --> 05:41.674
or this series, or this whole genre.

05:44.218 --> 05:45.053
But you do.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.264
What are you doing?

05:48.348 --> 05:49.599
This is yours.

05:50.224 --> 05:51.059
[chuckles]

05:51.851 --> 05:53.603
You should write this book without me.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.440
I don't think that's a good idea.

05:57.523 --> 06:00.526
That's where...a ying and the yang thing
we have going on.

06:00.610 --> 06:01.486
We're a team.

06:02.111 --> 06:02.945
You're yang.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.781
Listen, I don't love the material.

06:04.864 --> 06:05.948
-I never have.
-Well.

06:06.032 --> 06:09.202
It doesn't speak to me the way
it speaks to you.   You love it.

06:09.285 --> 06:10.328
You should write it.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.372
We're at the point in our lives,

06:12.455 --> 06:14.957
where we should only be doing
what we love, Max.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.418
I mean, Ethan. You do realize
you're under contract still.

06:17.919 --> 06:18.753
You're on a contract.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.380
You're on a contract. That's...

06:21.089 --> 06:22.507
too bad. Whoops.

06:22.590 --> 06:24.425
Guess we'll have to bang this out
together.

06:24.509 --> 06:25.635
Take my name off it.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.804
Max doesn't even have a writing sample.

06:27.887 --> 06:31.057
I mean, no offense, but I'm a little weary
of trusting a first-time writer

06:31.182 --> 06:32.809
with an emerging franchise.

06:33.017 --> 06:34.435
No offense taken.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.104
Eminently reasonable of you.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.356
I mean, I would love to write it,
you know.

06:38.439 --> 06:39.690
If I were wearing my author hat,

06:39.774 --> 06:41.484
I'd be like "Oh my God,
what an opportunity!"

06:41.567 --> 06:44.070
But then I put my agent hat on, and I say
"Wait, slow down there.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.530
Slow down guys.

06:45.613 --> 06:48.074
Let's think about what this means
to everyone's career."

06:48.157 --> 06:49.826
You know? Author, "But I want to write it.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.911
This is such a big opportunity for me.
Look at this."

06:52.078 --> 06:54.705
Agent. "Hold on. This is your first book,

06:54.872 --> 06:57.458
you don't want to get in the weeds
too deep and ruin your career

06:57.542 --> 06:58.876
before it even starts."

06:58.960 --> 07:01.712
Author, "Oh my gosh.
Thanks so much for looking out for me.

07:01.796 --> 07:04.257
Would you tell Ethan,
while I appreciate the offer.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.426
It's probably going to be
a bad deal for me."

07:07.176 --> 07:09.345
"Okay, I will. Don't do that."

07:09.637 --> 07:12.473
We should write it together
as per the contract

07:12.932 --> 07:14.058
and our plan.

07:14.684 --> 07:15.685
But you do have a sample.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.270
Those pages.

07:18.104 --> 07:18.938
I'm confused.

07:19.021 --> 07:21.190
The words and the ideas are all Max's.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.400
These are his ideas.

07:22.650 --> 07:23.734
Those are his words.

07:24.735 --> 07:26.571
Okay. Did you write the pages, Max?

07:27.989 --> 07:28.823
[Max snorts]

07:29.532 --> 07:30.825
[Man giggles]

07:30.908 --> 07:32.034
-Wow.
-Absolutely.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.328
I mean you can look at other writers.

07:34.412 --> 07:36.914
But the person for the job
is right in front of you.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.499
It's not how this is done.

07:38.666 --> 07:41.544
It's not how this is done.
You don't just switch... agent hat.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.254
Agent hat. Agent hat!

07:43.463 --> 07:45.631
You don't switch in the middle.
You don't-- Right?

07:45.756 --> 07:48.259
I mean, is that what you want?
Do you want to write this?

07:50.386 --> 07:51.220
Hot diggity.

07:52.722 --> 07:53.806
[photographer]
Keep fixing each other's ties.

07:53.890 --> 07:54.724
[camera shutter clicks]

07:54.807 --> 07:56.184
Beautiful. Beautiful.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.769
Hey little guy, fix the big guy's tie.
That'd be great.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.396
-It's Max. Max and Felix.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.273
-We had like three meetings.
-I'm not here.

08:02.398 --> 08:04.609
I know you're not here,
but you are talking so much.

08:04.692 --> 08:05.985
-And I just-- Okay.
-Just do it.

08:06.986 --> 08:09.906
Guess what? I was able to upgrade us
to business class.

08:10.072 --> 08:11.199
Keep adjusting the ties.

08:11.282 --> 08:13.409
Can we stop obsessing over the honeymoon?

08:13.493 --> 08:15.286
-It's just not where my head is right now.
-OK.

08:15.369 --> 08:18.581
And honestly, I think we might have to
cut it short. By like two thirds.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.334
-Just lop off the last  ten days.
-What are you talking about?

08:21.501 --> 08:22.919
I'm-- I'm so stressed.

08:23.002 --> 08:24.795
I have this deadline, you know,

08:24.962 --> 08:25.838
hanging over my head.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.548
Oh!

08:27.632 --> 08:28.508
I see.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.468
Writer problems.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.303
And hold hands. I'm not here.

08:32.386 --> 08:34.555
I'm sorry to be talking about this now.

08:35.264 --> 08:36.807
Thank you for being so supportive.

08:37.099 --> 08:38.684
[camera shutter clicks rapidly]

08:39.143 --> 08:41.521
-For being so supportive during all this.
-[camera shutter clicks rapidly]

08:42.563 --> 08:43.981
You've been such a--

08:44.941 --> 08:46.484
-You've been--
-[camera shutter clicks]

08:48.277 --> 08:49.570
-Got it?
-I'm not here.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.989
-You're so here.
-[Felix chuckles]

08:52.114 --> 08:53.950
-You've been such a huge help.
-More than you know.

08:54.909 --> 08:57.286
How about back to back? Would you do that?
That'd be adorable.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.204
-Sure.
-Keep going.

08:58.287 --> 08:59.121
Yeah.

09:01.624 --> 09:02.500
What do you mean?

09:03.292 --> 09:04.669
What do you mean more than I know?

09:04.752 --> 09:05.586
Oh.

09:05.670 --> 09:09.006
Well, it may not have been Ethan's idea
to write the book with you.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.716
There may have been a lunch.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.051
There may have been

09:12.134 --> 09:15.263
powers of persuasion unleashed
on your behalf.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.056
Wait.

09:18.516 --> 09:21.686
You took Ethan to lunch and told him
to write the book with me?

09:21.769 --> 09:22.645
I might have.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.439
Can you just give us a second, please?

09:25.523 --> 09:28.693
-Wait, you're not actually upset. Are you?
-[shouts] Yes, I'm actually upset!

09:28.776 --> 09:32.196
Okay, I'm sorry I went behind your back.
But it all worked out.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.364
You got what you deserve.

09:33.447 --> 09:35.616
-You're a writer now.
-Because you meddled!

09:35.741 --> 09:38.369
You made it happen.
You pulled the strings!

09:38.452 --> 09:39.996
Why are you so upset?

09:41.622 --> 09:43.416
-Are you having trouble writing?
-No!

09:43.499 --> 09:45.293
I'm a natural born writer.
You know that.

09:45.376 --> 09:46.794
The work, that's the easy part!

09:47.044 --> 09:47.878
The words are...

09:50.381 --> 09:52.008
-You know?
-The words are?

09:52.800 --> 09:54.885
You know what?
They're... easy to come out.

09:54.969 --> 09:58.556
Hi. We are ready for group pictures
on the plaza.

09:58.639 --> 10:00.933
I'm sorry, but would you have worn that
to a straight wedding?

10:01.601 --> 10:02.435
Yes.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.187
Let's shoot and walk.
