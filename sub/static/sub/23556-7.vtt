WEBVTT

00:05.705 --> 00:07.373
What did you say?

00:07.441 --> 00:11.243
Daddy! That's Daddy!

00:11.312 --> 00:12.611
William Ruybosch
was your father?

00:14.348 --> 00:17.416
I'm sorry you lost
your father, Evie.

00:17.485 --> 00:18.784
Me, too.

00:22.156 --> 00:23.355
Me, too.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.491
I definitely see
the resemblance between you two.

00:25.559 --> 00:28.093
He looks like
a fine gentleman.

00:28.162 --> 00:31.029
I'm sure your father
was very proud of you.

00:31.098 --> 00:32.430
What else did you find
on him?

00:32.500 --> 00:34.233
Nothing. Zero. Zilch.

00:34.301 --> 00:35.601
Nada.

00:35.669 --> 00:37.102
What do you mean?

00:37.171 --> 00:39.104
No. That's Indonesian.

00:39.173 --> 00:41.106
,
in Turkish.

00:41.175 --> 00:42.808
I understand
what "nothing" means.

00:42.877 --> 00:44.810
How could there be...

00:44.879 --> 00:46.612
on him?

00:46.680 --> 00:48.113
I don't know!

00:48.182 --> 00:49.448
Somebody erased him
from the internet.

00:49.517 --> 00:52.117
There's absolutely nix,
as they say in Holland.

00:52.186 --> 00:54.119
Ruybosch.

00:54.188 --> 00:55.788
Why does that name
sound so familiar?

00:55.856 --> 00:57.289
Could be something
to investigate.

00:58.692 --> 01:01.460
Ruybosch...

01:01.529 --> 01:04.129
Ruybosch, Ruybosch,
Ruybosch...

01:05.465 --> 01:06.565
Where's she going?

01:06.634 --> 01:08.133
Only one way
to find out.

01:08.202 --> 01:09.301
Here we go!

01:12.306 --> 01:14.406
What are you doing?
When you said "Ruybosch,"

01:14.475 --> 01:15.741
I knew I'd seen
that name before.

01:15.810 --> 01:17.743
And then I remembered Evie,

01:17.812 --> 01:19.278
when she was looking at
the painting the other day.

01:19.346 --> 01:20.546
Bam!

01:20.614 --> 01:23.682
Give a warm welcome
to Friso Hunter

01:23.751 --> 01:24.683
and Gerard Ruybosch.

01:26.954 --> 01:28.086
Ruybosch!

01:28.155 --> 01:29.988
That's the same last name
as Evie's father.

01:30.057 --> 01:33.492
Why would Gerard Ruybosch
stand next to...

01:33.561 --> 01:35.594
Friso Hunter
in a painting?

01:35.663 --> 01:37.429
It means there's
an old connection between

01:37.498 --> 01:39.565
the Hunters and the Ruybosches,
and that means...

01:39.633 --> 01:42.000
There must be something
about them in this library.

01:42.069 --> 01:43.836
Erasing him from the internet
doesn't erase him

01:43.904 --> 01:45.637
from our old friends,
paper and ink.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.873
Who?
Books, Anika.

01:47.942 --> 01:49.341
Time for some good
old-fashioned research!

01:49.410 --> 01:50.342
Who's in?

01:51.812 --> 01:54.680
Oh, I'm still trying
to recover my backup.

01:54.748 --> 01:57.449
Yeah, and I'm giving
an online drawing class,

01:57.518 --> 01:58.650
so... I'm sorry.

01:59.987 --> 02:02.054
I would...

02:02.122 --> 02:03.422
but libraries are boring.

02:07.361 --> 02:08.560
Just go.

02:09.697 --> 02:11.129
I'll do this myself.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.402
People always draw the eyes
way too high up on the head,

02:17.471 --> 02:20.005
and it makes your character
look like a caveman.

02:20.074 --> 02:23.709
The eyes should go halfway down
the head, same as the ears.

02:23.777 --> 02:26.411
Well, that's it for today.
And remember what they say:

02:26.480 --> 02:28.881
An artist is a wizard
with a pencil for a wand.

02:28.949 --> 02:29.882
Bye!

02:35.823 --> 02:38.023
Official Comcrete Comics?

02:38.092 --> 02:40.292
"Rad video, Jake.

02:40.361 --> 02:43.095
I see a great future for you."

02:43.163 --> 02:45.430
Oh, wow, oh, wow.
Oh, wow!

02:45.499 --> 02:47.099
Everything okay?

02:47.167 --> 02:50.102
I just got a comment
from Comcrete Comics.

02:50.170 --> 02:54.072
What's that?
Uh, only the biggest comics
publisher in the world.

02:54.141 --> 02:58.010
I mean, they created
Justice Judge Jackson.

02:58.078 --> 03:01.713
I mean... they see
a great future for me.

03:01.782 --> 03:02.714
Oh, wow.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.049
Oh, wow!

03:04.118 --> 03:06.218
Oh, wow, oh, wow!
So I hear.

03:06.287 --> 03:10.389
I mean, this could be huge
for my career.

03:10.457 --> 03:12.558
I'm so happy for you.

03:12.626 --> 03:13.859
I'll see it
as a good start.

03:15.496 --> 03:18.764
Yeah... oh, wow!

03:23.637 --> 03:24.570
Jake? Tess?

03:26.473 --> 03:28.407
Going to see Erik's attorney,

03:28.475 --> 03:30.208
and someone needs to keep
an eye on Evie for a few hours.

03:30.277 --> 03:32.077
I'll do it.

03:34.014 --> 03:36.582
Come on, you guys.
I'm not a little kid anymore.

03:37.651 --> 03:38.584
No, you're not.

03:38.652 --> 03:39.785
And we trust you, right?

03:39.853 --> 03:41.119
Yeah, we absolutely do.

03:41.188 --> 03:45.023
Well, you can always ask Tess
or Jake if you need anything.

03:45.092 --> 03:46.992
You guys can count on me.

03:47.061 --> 03:49.795
I've got everything
under control!

03:49.863 --> 03:50.796
Anika!

03:50.864 --> 03:53.365
Anika! You okay?
Yeah!

03:53.434 --> 03:54.766
I'm fine.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.436
And I can always call you
in case of an emergency.

03:57.504 --> 04:00.038
But, uh, not that there would
ever be an emergency

04:00.107 --> 04:01.106
with me on the job, so...

04:01.175 --> 04:03.075
Well, now I'm really sold.

04:03.143 --> 04:05.978
Thank you, Anika.
Bye. Go now.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.897
Tess? Where are you?

04:08.966 --> 04:10.232
Are you sleeping?

04:10.301 --> 04:13.068
'Cause I have some
smelling salts to wake you up.

04:13.137 --> 04:14.369
Well, actually,
it's Sal's shoe

04:14.438 --> 04:16.238
but it kinda works the same,
I mean I... ahh!

04:18.309 --> 04:20.742
This is beyond weird.

04:20.810 --> 04:23.745
What did you find?

04:23.814 --> 04:25.147
Check out
all these books.

04:25.215 --> 04:26.415
All these stacks of information,

04:26.483 --> 04:27.749
yet there's nothing
on the Ruybosches.

04:27.818 --> 04:29.151
Not one word!

04:29.219 --> 04:31.586
Last time...

04:31.655 --> 04:33.922
even Saganash left
more of a trail.

04:33.991 --> 04:34.990
Something stinks.

04:35.059 --> 04:37.926
Oh, that's Sal's shoe.

04:37.995 --> 04:39.194
Yuck...

04:39.263 --> 04:40.595
No, I mean, like,

04:40.664 --> 04:43.198
Ruybosch has just...
vanished.

04:43.267 --> 04:44.466
Where did they go?

04:44.535 --> 04:46.001
How did a whole family
just disappear?

04:46.070 --> 04:47.636
Yeah, I'd stay and help you,

04:47.705 --> 04:49.037
but I've got important things
to do.

04:49.106 --> 04:51.740
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, Kate and Erik asked me
to babysit Evie.

04:51.809 --> 04:54.710
That's a big responsibility,
and they trusted me 100%.

04:54.778 --> 04:57.312
1000%, one might even say...
So where's Evie?

04:57.381 --> 04:58.880
Oh...

04:58.949 --> 05:00.215
I'm just kidding!

05:00.284 --> 05:02.184
She's setting up a game
of checkers in the kitchen.

05:02.252 --> 05:03.418
Mm, sounds fun.

05:03.487 --> 05:05.554
Yeah!

05:08.292 --> 05:09.391
I'm fine!

05:12.429 --> 05:16.898
Thanks, Comcrete Comics.
I love your company!

05:16.967 --> 05:18.500
I love your company?

05:18.569 --> 05:20.736
Ah! Lame.

05:20.804 --> 05:23.238
How did they get into
my backup drive?

05:23.307 --> 05:26.241
It isn't even connected to
the internal network.

05:26.310 --> 05:28.577
Maybe I should just
play it cool.

05:28.645 --> 05:31.913
Yeah, you guys make
some decent stuff.

05:31.982 --> 05:33.315
Yeah. What do you think?

05:33.384 --> 05:34.583
I bet Jenny would know.

05:34.651 --> 05:36.351
Oh, what if they think
I'm conceited?

05:36.420 --> 05:39.154
Oh... maybe I should just...
Well, maybe if I ask her
to come over?

05:42.426 --> 05:44.192
Right?
What do you think?

05:44.261 --> 05:45.861
Yeah, go for it.
Yeah, definitely.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.162
You sure?
You think?

05:47.231 --> 05:48.497
Okay...
Okay, thanks!

05:49.933 --> 05:51.366
You're welcome!

05:53.270 --> 05:54.469
Okay, Sal...

05:54.538 --> 05:55.637
Slow down, slow down,
slow down.

05:55.706 --> 05:58.106
Just tell her
you have something for her.

05:58.175 --> 06:00.876
Then ask her to come over.

06:00.944 --> 06:02.544
Yeah, yeah!
That could work!

06:02.613 --> 06:05.881
That's a really good move!

06:05.949 --> 06:09.885
You sure you've never
played this game before?

06:09.953 --> 06:11.553
It's my turn now.

06:11.622 --> 06:12.654
Let's see...

06:13.624 --> 06:14.656
Woosh! Your turn!

06:17.961 --> 06:19.361
You're picking up on this
quickly.

06:20.230 --> 06:21.196
Wait, you won!

06:21.265 --> 06:23.498
Can we play
hide and seek now?

06:23.567 --> 06:24.499
You don't think this is fun?

06:24.568 --> 06:27.235
It's fun, but...

06:27.304 --> 06:29.204
hide and seek
is sooo much funner.

06:29.273 --> 06:32.574
Yeah, but I promised
to keep an eye on you.

06:32.643 --> 06:36.011
So... You gotta stay
where my eyes can sees ya!

06:36.080 --> 06:37.879
First, you get a prize.

06:37.948 --> 06:38.914
What is it?

06:38.982 --> 06:41.883
Drumroll...

06:41.952 --> 06:43.952
Another game of checkers!

06:45.155 --> 06:46.455
Yay!

06:47.925 --> 06:49.024
Yay...

06:55.933 --> 06:57.532
Okay...

06:57.601 --> 06:58.700
Here we go.

07:01.772 --> 07:04.372
Okay. Slow down.

07:04.441 --> 07:06.741
Not too enthusiastic.

07:07.945 --> 07:09.377
Hey, Jenny!
How are ya?!

07:09.446 --> 07:10.579
I mean... ahem!

07:10.647 --> 07:11.580
Sup?

07:14.618 --> 07:15.917
Wow...

07:15.986 --> 07:17.486
This is so cool.

07:17.554 --> 07:21.990
I mean, I loved the front
of the building, but inside?

07:22.059 --> 07:23.358
Wow!

07:23.427 --> 07:25.460
<i>You... you live here?</i>

07:25.529 --> 07:28.130
Yeah, I live here
pretty much every day.

07:28.198 --> 07:31.233
<i>That looks so...</i>

07:31.301 --> 07:32.501
good.

07:34.037 --> 07:34.970
<i>I do?</i>

07:35.038 --> 07:37.205
Uh, I mean, this house.

07:37.274 --> 07:39.107
It's so amazing!

07:39.176 --> 07:41.143
Do you have your laptop?

07:41.211 --> 07:44.746
Always. It's like my
digital little sister.

07:47.084 --> 07:48.517
So, what's the problem?

07:48.585 --> 07:50.685
Trouble connecting to
the signal loop?

07:50.754 --> 07:53.522
Yeah... uh, n-no.

07:53.590 --> 07:55.490
It's my background server.

07:55.559 --> 07:57.459
But, first thing's first.
I got you something.

08:01.098 --> 08:02.430
Wow!

08:02.499 --> 08:03.431
It's a SCSI.

08:03.500 --> 08:06.268
That's... that's really sweet
of you.

08:06.336 --> 08:08.537
It's just a little gift
for helping us out.

08:08.605 --> 08:10.639
It's really cool of you.
No problem.

08:10.707 --> 08:13.008
So, what's your IP address?

08:13.076 --> 08:14.876
Oh! Never mind.

08:14.945 --> 08:17.212
With this little box...

08:17.281 --> 08:20.215
I can easily
figure it out.

08:20.284 --> 08:22.050
Wow...

08:22.119 --> 08:24.886
You're amazing.

08:24.955 --> 08:26.388
I-I mean...
that's amazing.

08:26.456 --> 08:28.823
The thing.

08:32.629 --> 08:36.164
<i>Tess? This is Sal.
Come in, Tess.</i>

08:36.232 --> 08:40.501
<i>Tess!</i>

08:40.571 --> 08:42.770
<i>Tess. Come in.</i>

08:42.839 --> 08:43.837
Tess. Come in.

08:46.743 --> 08:49.711
Hi, Sal! This Ruybosch business
is really strange.

08:49.780 --> 08:52.981
<i>These guys must have been,</i>
<i>like, a top-secret family</i>
<i>or something.</i>

08:53.050 --> 08:54.516
You find anything?

08:54.585 --> 08:56.518
Actually, Jenny's here.

08:56.587 --> 08:58.520
<i>I asked her to help us out.</i>

09:03.694 --> 09:05.560
There must be something wrong
with this thing.

09:05.629 --> 09:08.730
<i>It sounded like
you asked Jenny to help us out?</i>

09:08.799 --> 09:11.066
I know you wouldn't bring
a non-Hunter into this...

09:11.134 --> 09:12.434
Well, she was already
into it.

09:12.502 --> 09:14.869
<i>Besides, Jake said
it was okay.</i>

09:14.938 --> 09:16.371
<i>And I really need her help.</i>

09:16.440 --> 09:18.873
<i>Help with what?!</i>
I was hacked.

09:18.942 --> 09:20.542
<i>The server
was completely wiped.</i>

09:20.611 --> 09:22.877
Everyone should stay off
their computers.

09:22.946 --> 09:24.879
Jenn is trying to chase
the signal.

09:24.948 --> 09:26.982
Oh... so now she's Jenn.

09:27.050 --> 09:28.950
<i>All right.
Find out as much as you can.</i>

09:29.019 --> 09:30.585
And be careful.

09:30.654 --> 09:32.887
Wh... She...
Sal.

09:32.956 --> 09:34.222
You need to see this.

09:37.628 --> 09:39.227
Yay! You won!

09:39.296 --> 09:41.730
For the 14th time!

09:41.798 --> 09:43.164
This time, you get
an extra big prize.

09:43.233 --> 09:46.935
Can we finally play
hide and seek?

09:48.272 --> 09:51.239
Oh, how can I say no
to those puppy-wuppy-duppy eyes?

09:53.010 --> 09:55.710
But I promised to keep
an eye on you.

09:55.779 --> 09:57.379
But then again...

09:57.447 --> 09:59.247
your hiding skills
are not that great,

09:59.316 --> 10:01.283
so I'll probably find you
pretty easily.

10:03.086 --> 10:04.019
Okay, I'll count down.

10:04.087 --> 10:05.020
Yes, yes!

10:05.088 --> 10:06.588
Ten and a half...

10:06.657 --> 10:07.822
nine and a half...

10:07.891 --> 10:09.257
eight and a half...

10:09.326 --> 10:10.925
seven and a half...

10:10.994 --> 10:12.761
six and a half...

10:12.829 --> 10:14.929
five and a half...

10:14.998 --> 10:16.931
four, three, two, one!

10:17.000 --> 10:18.933
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

10:22.139 --> 10:23.438
Help!

10:25.709 --> 10:26.741
Someone, please!

10:26.810 --> 10:29.411
Big sister needs her
very strong little sister.

10:29.479 --> 10:30.945
Here!

10:33.150 --> 10:34.549
Actually...

10:34.618 --> 10:36.184
This just might be
the breakthrough

10:36.253 --> 10:38.987
we need to sort out this mess.

10:40.457 --> 10:42.390
Or make a mess.

10:44.961 --> 10:47.062
So, what are we
looking for?

10:48.999 --> 10:51.900
This.
That was quick.

10:51.968 --> 10:53.568
I have a talent
for these things.

10:53.637 --> 10:57.205
"Ruybosch Family Tree."

10:58.275 --> 10:59.207
Gerard...

11:01.144 --> 11:02.277
There's William.

11:04.147 --> 11:05.347
Look at the last one.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.182
Evie Ruybosch.

11:07.250 --> 11:10.085
Looks like you missed
the biggest clue of all,

11:10.153 --> 11:12.253
Miss Super Talent
For These Things.

11:12.322 --> 11:13.321
What's that?

11:19.663 --> 11:21.496
That. It's the same crown.

11:29.172 --> 11:32.674
So the Ruybosch Family Tree
is a crown itself...

11:32.743 --> 11:34.576
Uh-huh! Upside down.

11:34.644 --> 11:36.745
I've got a talent
for these things.

11:36.813 --> 11:39.247
But there's more.
Jenny and Sal found a hack...

11:39.316 --> 11:41.316
Jenny?! How is she
helping us?

11:41.385 --> 11:44.085
Sal said you said
it was okay.

11:44.154 --> 11:45.754
What? I didn't...

11:45.822 --> 11:47.956
Oh, well, I might have.

11:48.024 --> 11:49.491
Well, we shouldn't
trust anyone, right?

11:49.559 --> 11:50.992
She seems really nice.

11:51.061 --> 11:52.560
Well, you can fake nice.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.829
She could be
hiding something.

11:54.898 --> 11:56.064
Speaking of hiding,

11:56.133 --> 11:58.032
weren't you supposed to
keep an eye on Evie?

12:02.339 --> 12:03.638
You're really fast.

12:03.707 --> 12:05.473
I actually use
the DVORAK setting

12:05.542 --> 12:06.975
instead of the QWERTY keyboard.

12:07.043 --> 12:08.076
You should try it.

12:08.145 --> 12:10.879
You get about 200
extra keystrokes per minute.

12:10.947 --> 12:12.881
What's your typing speed now?

12:12.949 --> 12:14.749
Bingo...

12:14.818 --> 12:16.584
Bingo isn't a number.
Is it?

12:16.653 --> 12:19.287
No, I think I found
your hacker.

12:19.356 --> 12:20.822
You know who did this?

12:20.891 --> 12:21.823
Pass me some tape.

12:23.226 --> 12:24.325
What... what do you
need tape for?

12:24.394 --> 12:25.760
I'll explain in a minute.

12:25.829 --> 12:27.595
First, we have to make sure
those hackers can't see us.

12:27.664 --> 12:29.431
What are you talking about?
That webcam isn't on.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.366
That's what you think.

12:34.938 --> 12:37.372
Oh, no! They're onto me.

12:37.441 --> 12:41.743
<i>Okay. Bye, creep.</i>

12:41.812 --> 12:43.044
<i>The computer system</i>
<i>is being hacked.</i>

12:43.113 --> 12:44.712
I gotta build an extra firewall.

12:44.781 --> 12:46.481
They can't get into
my system...

12:48.000 --> 12:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:57.961 --> 12:59.127
Bingo!

13:02.466 --> 13:03.832
<i>We know you're listening,</i>

13:03.900 --> 13:06.067
<i>and we're gonna find out
who you are.</i>

13:06.136 --> 13:08.903
Little punks!

13:08.972 --> 13:11.306
<i>First, I'm gonna play you
a little song.</i>

13:11.374 --> 13:14.309
Song?

13:19.149 --> 13:20.081
What was that?

13:20.150 --> 13:21.416
Maybe it was Evie
calling us?

13:23.820 --> 13:26.087
Evie? Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

13:26.156 --> 13:28.423
You win, Evie.
Please come out.
Evie?

13:28.492 --> 13:30.091
Come out, Evie.
Come here!

13:30.160 --> 13:32.193
Come on, Evie.
How could I
let this happen?

13:32.262 --> 13:35.029
Okay, you've won now.
It's okay, Anika.
We'll find her.

13:35.098 --> 13:37.031
She didn't just disappear.

13:39.769 --> 13:44.038
Yes! Ho, ho, ho! Yes!

13:44.107 --> 13:46.140
Comcrete Comics asked me
if I wanted to teach

13:46.209 --> 13:48.142
a workshop at their
next convention.

13:48.211 --> 13:49.377
Can you believe it?

13:49.446 --> 13:51.379
One of the biggest comic
conventions in the world,

13:51.448 --> 13:52.714
and I'm teaching a workshop!

13:52.782 --> 13:54.048
Yes!

13:54.117 --> 13:56.217
That's amazing, but we
don't have time for this.

13:56.286 --> 13:58.119
Can we talk about it later?
We need to find Evie!

13:58.188 --> 14:01.723
Right, sorry, yeah...
Evie?

14:01.791 --> 14:03.725
Uh, Evie?

14:03.793 --> 14:08.062
Evie?!

14:08.131 --> 14:09.397
Hi, guys.
Hey.

14:09.466 --> 14:11.065
How are you?

14:11.134 --> 14:12.400
Great!

14:12.469 --> 14:14.636
Everything's a-okay. Perfect.

14:14.704 --> 14:15.837
How did things go
with Evie?

14:15.906 --> 14:20.008
...Great. Yep!
We played checkers, everything.

14:20.076 --> 14:21.276
So, where is she?

14:21.344 --> 14:24.078
Um...

14:24.147 --> 14:26.915
Uh, well, uh, we're playing
hide and seek, so,

14:26.983 --> 14:28.082
Evie's "hiding."

14:28.151 --> 14:30.752
And, uh, I'm seeking, so...

14:30.820 --> 14:32.153
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

14:32.222 --> 14:34.556
Well, it sounds like you guys
had a really good time.

14:34.624 --> 14:36.691
But we are going
to have dinner soon,

14:36.760 --> 14:38.626
so it is time you "find" her.

14:38.695 --> 14:40.028
Okay.
Yep.

14:40.096 --> 14:42.964
Sure thing.

14:49.439 --> 14:51.039
I doubled the entry security.

14:51.107 --> 14:54.042
Everything needs to get through
two proxies.

14:54.110 --> 14:55.743
You'll be safe.

14:55.812 --> 14:57.845
Jake! You should have seen it.

14:57.914 --> 15:00.114
The way Jenny kicked out those
hackers, it was amazing.

15:00.183 --> 15:02.216
Sal, could I have
a word with you in private?

15:06.790 --> 15:09.324
What?
Uh, I know you really like
this girl,

15:09.392 --> 15:12.060
and she helped us a lot
with the footage,

15:12.128 --> 15:13.895
but we don't know
of we can trust her.

15:13.964 --> 15:16.364
She could be working with
the enemy, for all we know.

15:17.968 --> 15:19.968
I don't think so.
She really helped us out.

15:20.036 --> 15:22.236
Maybe she is on our side,

15:22.305 --> 15:25.640
but... we need to keep this
in the family.

15:25.709 --> 15:26.641
Play it safe.

15:32.749 --> 15:34.515
Yeah...

15:34.584 --> 15:35.516
We should play it safe.

15:35.585 --> 15:36.751
You want me to tell her?

15:36.820 --> 15:39.287
No. I'll do it.

15:45.095 --> 15:46.694
What's wrong?

15:46.763 --> 15:48.696
I'm really sorry.

15:48.765 --> 15:50.365
Yeah, this sucks.

15:50.433 --> 15:52.033
I wish I could
help out more.

15:52.102 --> 15:54.202
Your family is so cool,

15:54.270 --> 15:56.371
but maybe on
your next adventure?

15:56.439 --> 15:58.106
Yeah, that'd be great.

15:58.174 --> 16:00.041
I'll let you know
when that happens.

16:00.110 --> 16:03.378
I hope you can use the code
to find out who was hacking you.

16:03.446 --> 16:05.046
And thanks for the SCSI.

16:05.115 --> 16:07.281
Um... I have something
for you.
What is it?

16:07.350 --> 16:09.217
I tried to hack
the hackers.

16:09.285 --> 16:10.685
It's a file
from their computer.

16:10.754 --> 16:13.855
It's still encrypted and I
didn't get the whole thing,

16:13.923 --> 16:16.124
but maybe you can
get something off it.

16:16.192 --> 16:19.727
Thanks, Jenny.
You're amazing.

16:20.797 --> 16:22.897
You mind saying that
for the camera?

16:22.966 --> 16:24.999
I need to wrap up
this episode of my vlog.

16:25.068 --> 16:26.634
Right, right.

16:26.703 --> 16:28.970
<i>Jenny's the coolest girl ever.</i>

16:33.743 --> 16:35.209
You really think so?

16:43.453 --> 16:45.353
All right.
See you next time.

16:49.092 --> 16:50.525
You'll see her again.
I'm sure.

16:52.862 --> 16:55.596
And they asked me to do
a workshop at their
comic convention!

16:55.665 --> 16:57.031
Well, that's a amazing, Jake.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.366
Can you believe it?

16:58.435 --> 17:01.703
Me, at the Comcrete
Comics Convention!

17:01.771 --> 17:03.538
Wow! I mean, I'm so excited

17:03.606 --> 17:05.039
I feel like
my head's gonna explode.

17:05.108 --> 17:06.708
Well, please don't.
Let's first eat, okay?

17:06.776 --> 17:09.042
Right, yeah, sure.

17:09.112 --> 17:11.045
Oh...

17:23.460 --> 17:25.059
London?
Wow.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.728
That's quite a trip.
Next week?

17:26.796 --> 17:28.396
I don't know
if that's possible

17:28.464 --> 17:31.399
with the ongoing investigation.

17:31.468 --> 17:33.000
Hmm...

17:33.069 --> 17:36.671
Well, it... yeah.
It's no big deal.

17:36.740 --> 17:38.439
Well, I don't know, I...

17:38.508 --> 17:41.109
I guess I could
talk to Kate.

17:44.748 --> 17:46.514
Thanks, Erik, but, um...

17:46.583 --> 17:48.282
You don't need to do that.

17:48.351 --> 17:49.383
There'll be
more conventions.

17:49.452 --> 17:52.019
Jake, I know how much
it means to you.

17:52.088 --> 17:53.688
And I want you to know this:

17:53.757 --> 17:55.790
With your talent
and dedication,

17:55.859 --> 17:57.892
I'm sure you're gonna
make it big one day.

17:57.961 --> 18:00.361
Sooner or later.

18:00.430 --> 18:01.562
I know that.

18:09.706 --> 18:10.638
So, what'd you find out?

18:10.707 --> 18:12.206
I don't know.

18:12.275 --> 18:13.641
Jenn gave me a piece of
an encrypted file.

18:13.710 --> 18:16.744
If I can open it, it might
show us who's behind all this.

18:16.813 --> 18:19.013
She could have helped.

18:19.082 --> 18:21.716
I'm sorry, Sal, but we
don't know who we can trust.

18:21.785 --> 18:22.884
We have to do this
on our own.

18:22.952 --> 18:24.852
Kids! Dinner!

18:24.921 --> 18:26.521
Tess? Can you get Jake?
He's upstairs.

18:26.589 --> 18:28.456
After dinner?
After dinner.

18:29.759 --> 18:32.326
Evie? Please come out!

18:32.395 --> 18:33.995
I'll give you
whatever you want!

18:34.063 --> 18:37.331
My roller skates, cash,
you name it!

18:37.400 --> 18:39.500
Anika, let's go!

18:39.569 --> 18:41.769
Evie...

18:49.679 --> 18:52.013
Um... guys?

18:52.081 --> 18:55.183
I...

18:55.251 --> 18:56.417
have a confession to make.

18:56.486 --> 18:57.552
What is it, Anika?

18:57.620 --> 18:59.587
I lied about Evie.

18:59.656 --> 19:01.189
Well, I didn't exactly lie,

19:01.257 --> 19:02.323
but I didn't tell you
the whole truth.

19:02.392 --> 19:03.658
We did play hide and seek,

19:03.726 --> 19:05.426
but I trained her
too well

19:05.495 --> 19:06.427
and now I can't find her.

19:07.997 --> 19:09.530
I'm sorry.

19:09.599 --> 19:11.165
You trusted me
and I blew it.

19:11.234 --> 19:13.201
Oh...

19:13.269 --> 19:16.137
I guess I am still
just a little kid.

19:16.206 --> 19:17.805
You know what?

19:17.874 --> 19:19.607
I was making dinner,

19:19.676 --> 19:21.375
I opened the cabinet,

19:21.444 --> 19:22.710
and look what I found.

19:23.947 --> 19:24.946
I win!

19:26.783 --> 19:30.051
I think she had
a really good day.

19:30.119 --> 19:34.222
Thank you, for taking such
good care of your little sister.

19:34.290 --> 19:35.623
Checkers? After dinner?

19:35.692 --> 19:36.657
Hide and seek.

19:37.961 --> 19:39.560
Ten and a half...

19:39.629 --> 19:41.329
nine and a half...

19:42.966 --> 19:45.900
Is that the registration
for the comic convention?

19:45.969 --> 19:47.034
I thought you weren't going?

19:47.103 --> 19:49.237
I'm not. I just...

19:49.305 --> 19:51.572
wanted to save the forms
just in case

19:51.641 --> 19:53.241
I don't get another chance.

19:53.309 --> 19:57.578
You'll totally
get another chance.

19:57.647 --> 19:59.847
It's just a matter of time
before you get your big break.

20:02.986 --> 20:04.418
Coming here
was my big break.

20:04.487 --> 20:05.620
Comcrete Comics can wait.

20:07.423 --> 20:08.522
Let's solve
this mystery first.

20:11.327 --> 20:13.594
So, did you find
the hackers yet?

20:27.577 --> 20:28.876
Yes!

20:28.945 --> 20:30.544
<i>Trojan horse installed.</i>

20:30.613 --> 20:33.214
I got you, you...
you kids!

20:35.618 --> 20:40.221
Jake took the bait.
He downloaded my Trojan.

20:40.290 --> 20:43.891
We still have access
to the Hunter house... boss.

20:49.565 --> 20:51.565
I don't know
if this is going to work.

20:51.634 --> 20:54.568
Jenn pulled this file down from
the hacker's computer...

20:54.637 --> 20:56.237
well, it's encrypted, and it...

20:56.306 --> 20:57.371
Why don't you just see?

20:59.175 --> 21:01.175
Okay. Decoding the file.

21:01.244 --> 21:02.443
Go.

21:11.321 --> 21:12.520
What does it say?

21:16.993 --> 21:19.293
The Relatives?

21:24.000 --> 21:27.568
"Member... number... one."

21:31.040 --> 21:32.173
