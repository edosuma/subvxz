13:58.240 --> 14:00.040
- Who are you?
- Doctor, her face.

14:00.080 --> 14:01.920
Yeah. I've just seen the same
thing on a naval officer

14:01.960 --> 14:03.840
- in Madagascar.
- (YELLS)

14:05.480 --> 14:07.440
(CRUNCHING)

14:13.040 --> 14:14.720
Jamila!

14:14.760 --> 14:16.040
Same as Zach on the beach.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.240
No, no, no,
this can't be happening.

14:18.280 --> 14:19.680
Hey, it's OK.

14:19.720 --> 14:21.120
- No, it's not!
- Two identical deaths

14:21.160 --> 14:22.920
on two different continents.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.840
It's even more dangerous
than I thought,

14:24.880 --> 14:26.200
and it's spreading.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.240
Which could mean...

14:28.360 --> 14:31.120
Have you heard
from Yaz and Graham?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.080
(BEEPING)

14:36.120 --> 14:37.640
Hey! Hey.

14:39.360 --> 14:42.440
Whatever is giving off
those weird readings...

14:44.080 --> 14:47.640
...is on the other side
of that wall.

14:51.200 --> 14:54.160
Is on the other side
of this door.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.040
You're welcome.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.720
(SIGHS)

14:59.600 --> 15:00.880
Locked from the inside.

15:00.920 --> 15:02.920
Maybe if we went round
the other way...

15:06.720 --> 15:08.440
Chat, chat, chat, chat, chat.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.360
What the hell's all this?

15:21.720 --> 15:24.160
Exactly what
we've been looking for.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.400
Adam?

15:35.440 --> 15:37.120
Adam!

15:37.160 --> 15:40.000
I told you he was here. I'm
gonna get this stuff off him.

15:40.040 --> 15:43.360
YAZ: Wait! Not until we know
what all this stuff is doing.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.280
No, Yaz is right. You can't
just go blundering in.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.440
You could end up killing him.

15:46.480 --> 15:47.800
How long's that going to take?

15:47.840 --> 15:49.560
We've been in this room
as long as you.

15:49.600 --> 15:54.040
Doctor, we found the source
of the energy.

15:54.080 --> 15:55.680
Plus a kidnapped astronaut.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.440
JAKE: Adam? Can you hear me?

15:57.480 --> 16:00.400
It's Jake. I'm here.
I'm here for you.

16:00.440 --> 16:02.240
I'm here.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.240
Get out.

16:05.280 --> 16:06.720
What?

16:06.760 --> 16:08.440
They'll come!

16:13.960 --> 16:15.800
GRAHAM: Unplug him
and get him out!

16:15.840 --> 16:17.960
You just said that wasn't safe!

16:18.000 --> 16:20.280
The situation's changed!
Get him out!

16:21.440 --> 16:22.880
Yaz, what are you doing?!

16:22.920 --> 16:24.880
Oi!

16:24.920 --> 16:26.440
Guns down, or I'll trash it.

16:26.480 --> 16:28.160
(LABOURED BREATHING)

16:28.200 --> 16:29.400
Hesitation.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.640
- Must be valuable.
- Yaz,

16:31.680 --> 16:33.480
we're out. Yaz, come on.

16:36.880 --> 16:38.440
Lads, keep going!

16:38.480 --> 16:39.600
They're right behind us.

16:39.640 --> 16:42.000
- You came.
- Course I came!

16:42.040 --> 16:44.720
Who are you with?
Can you get backup?

16:44.760 --> 16:46.400
Backup? Why would he
have backup?

16:46.440 --> 16:47.520
He's a copper!

16:47.560 --> 16:49.640
- Ex-copper.
- BOTH: What?

16:49.680 --> 16:51.400
- Can we not do this now?
- YAZ: Look out!

16:56.400 --> 16:57.480
- Down!
- Look out!

17:01.240 --> 17:02.800
I'm on a sabbatical.

17:02.840 --> 17:05.680
That's OK. So's she.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.320
Except I don't go around
announcing I'm police.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.160
Never believe anything he says.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.520
Mate, he's just come halfway
round the world to rescue you.

17:12.560 --> 17:13.640
Thank you!

17:13.680 --> 17:15.120
I scanned this building
for life signals

17:15.160 --> 17:17.600
before I sent you here,
so why didn't these register?

17:17.640 --> 17:19.520
- Doctor?
- Could be the suit

17:19.560 --> 17:21.480
- blocking the scan.
- JAKE: Is she with you?

17:21.520 --> 17:23.360
Uh! Can't get
the breathing apparatus off

17:23.400 --> 17:25.360
to see the face.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.320
Non-terrestrial.

17:27.360 --> 17:29.520
- Same as the weapon.
- Er...

17:30.680 --> 17:31.840
So, who are you?

17:31.880 --> 17:33.440
I'm the backup.

17:33.480 --> 17:36.560
Oh! Adam Lang.
Famous British astronaut.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.760
Famous missing
British astronaut.

17:38.800 --> 17:39.800
Glad you're safe.

17:39.840 --> 17:41.320
- How are you feeling?
- Terrible.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.520
Yeah, you look it.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.160
Hadn't factored you into this.

17:45.480 --> 17:47.160
Focused too much on that cat.

17:47.200 --> 17:50.440
This way. I'll introduce you
to Gabriela once we're inside.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.080
She's having a tough time
as well.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.640
Inside where?!

17:54.680 --> 17:56.560
Probably best
you see for yourself.

18:02.360 --> 18:05.440
Is it like, er,
an optical illusion?

18:06.680 --> 18:08.280
I really don't know.

18:12.760 --> 18:15.520
How long have you and Jamila
known each other?

18:15.560 --> 18:17.040
Five years.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.400
I don't know
what I'm going to do now.

18:22.440 --> 18:23.840
You'll get through it.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.040
Cos you've known me
for how many hours?

18:26.080 --> 18:28.320
We're going to find out
what happened.

18:28.360 --> 18:30.880
And we're going
to put it right.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.680
So you really don't believe
this thing travels?

18:42.960 --> 18:44.400
GABRIELA: No way.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.680
Through the doors!

18:49.720 --> 18:51.640
Past Ryan!

18:51.680 --> 18:52.480
We're not all going to fit

18:52.520 --> 18:53.520
- in there!
- You'd be surprised.

18:53.560 --> 18:55.400
Ryan, this is Jake and Adam.

18:55.440 --> 18:56.680
DOCTOR: Come on, Yaz!

18:56.720 --> 18:58.520
- No.
- Sorry?

18:58.560 --> 19:01.000
There was a device in there.
I couldn't get it free in time.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.360
It looked really important
to them.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.400
I want to go back and get it.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.800
- We don't have enough time.
- You go. Come back for me in,

19:05.840 --> 19:07.320
I don't know,
an hour or something.

19:07.360 --> 19:08.480
It's too dangerous.

19:08.520 --> 19:09.880
We need to know
why Adam was taken there

19:09.920 --> 19:10.960
and what they did to him,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.360
and how this is all connected
to those other events.

19:13.400 --> 19:16.520
I'll come with you. I'm more
than ready to fight something.

19:19.160 --> 19:20.160
One hour.

19:27.240 --> 19:29.840
Hey, I'm Gabriela.
You must be Yaz.

19:29.880 --> 19:31.800
YAZ: Come on.
It's through here.

19:35.280 --> 19:37.320
So the box is the doorway
to this building?

19:37.360 --> 19:39.480
No building.
You're still in the box.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.440
But...the box was smaller
than this.

19:41.480 --> 19:42.520
The inside of the box

19:42.560 --> 19:44.760
- is bigger than the outside.
- That's not possible.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.520
It clearly is,
cos you're in it.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.120
It's a space- and time-ship,
mate.

19:48.160 --> 19:49.800
- Don't be stupid.
- Well, excuse me,

19:49.840 --> 19:52.960
Inspector Morse, but I ain't
the fantasist round here.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.840
Adam, you really
don't look well.

19:54.880 --> 19:56.120
I need to do an MOT.

19:56.160 --> 19:57.200
(GROANS)

19:58.840 --> 20:01.040
- Ow!
- I did say it would hurt.

20:01.080 --> 20:02.440
- No, you didn't.
- Well, I meant to.

20:02.480 --> 20:05.640
It takes a blood sample
for analysis.

20:05.680 --> 20:09.120
So...International
Space Station.

20:09.160 --> 20:12.000
- Was it awesome?
- Really awesome.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.320
Best bits?

20:13.360 --> 20:15.840
Just watching the planet turn
across a day.

20:15.880 --> 20:17.880
The aurora borealis.

20:17.920 --> 20:21.600
Seeing hurricanes start to form
from above.

20:21.640 --> 20:26.200
It just changes how you...
see everything.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.080
(RINGTONE BEEPS)

20:29.120 --> 20:31.080
Incoming call.

20:31.120 --> 20:33.200
SUKI: Is this the Doctor?

20:33.240 --> 20:35.320
Aramu. Suki.
Everything all right?

20:35.360 --> 20:38.240
You said to call if anything
else unusual happened.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.280
(VWORP-VWORP)

20:42.560 --> 20:43.720
ARAMU: Suki?

20:43.760 --> 20:45.920
This is not an ordinary day.

20:45.960 --> 20:49.120
No. Very not ordinary.

20:50.240 --> 20:51.560
Before you show me unusual,

20:51.600 --> 20:53.640
can me and my friends
make use of your lab?

20:53.680 --> 20:55.640
- SUKI: Where did you go?
- Busy day.

20:58.560 --> 21:00.600
Still can't believe
what we saw earlier.

21:00.640 --> 21:03.240
He's not the first person
to die like that today.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.880
Same thing happened
to a young woman in Peru.

21:05.920 --> 21:08.520
They're linked.
I need to work out how.

21:08.560 --> 21:10.200
Plus, we've got
a sick astronaut

21:10.240 --> 21:11.760
getting sicker by the moment.

21:11.800 --> 21:14.640
So, you two know
each other how?

21:14.680 --> 21:16.600
- We're separated.
- We're married.

21:16.640 --> 21:18.960
Well, one of yous
is in for a shock.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.400
One of us doesn't like
putting the work in.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.560
I came halfway round the world.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.160
Seven months too late.

21:25.200 --> 21:29.560
Boys! Maybe now is not
the moment. Let's get inside.

21:29.600 --> 21:32.480
Come on, son. You can do it.
A few more steps.

21:32.520 --> 21:35.320
YAZ: The birds are
looking wrong here, too.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.520
ARAMU: I only saw it
the past few days.

21:37.560 --> 21:39.680
At first I thought

21:39.720 --> 21:40.800
it was OK, you know.

21:40.840 --> 21:43.440
It's not the first bird
to fly off its course.

21:43.480 --> 21:45.480
It's not native to Madagascar?

21:45.520 --> 21:47.080
No.

21:47.120 --> 21:50.160
Hey. Don't get too close.

21:50.200 --> 21:51.960
That's not the only one.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.400
Others...

21:54.440 --> 21:56.600
...have started to come.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.040
DOCTOR: Yes, they have.

21:58.080 --> 21:59.800
But why here?

22:01.160 --> 22:04.000
RYAN: There was a dead bird
in that deserted hospital,

22:04.040 --> 22:05.440
and all over the dumping ground

22:05.480 --> 22:07.320
where Gabriela and Jamila
were camping.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.640
And now they're circling this
beach where Zach washed up.

22:09.680 --> 22:11.560
- Alien birds?
- I don't know.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.680
If I could get hold of one
to analyse it...

22:13.720 --> 22:15.560
Good job I've got one
in my backpack.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.080
Picked it up
when I were in Peru.

22:17.120 --> 22:19.320
That's why you smell
of dead bird!

22:19.360 --> 22:20.840
I thought you'd changed
your shower gel.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.280
GRAHAM: Doc!

22:22.320 --> 22:24.720
Doc, Adam's in a bad way
in there.

22:24.760 --> 22:25.880
I think we made a mistake

22:25.920 --> 22:28.680
by disconnecting him from
all that gubbins in Hong Kong.

22:30.360 --> 22:32.880
Or maybe you just want to
stand out here watching birds.

22:32.920 --> 22:34.560
More like they're watching us.

22:34.600 --> 22:35.760
You go inside.

22:36.960 --> 22:38.160
I'll keep my eye on them.

22:38.200 --> 22:39.520
Let's take a look at Adam.

22:42.720 --> 22:44.760
Let us know
if anything changes, Aramu!

22:52.440 --> 22:53.960
GABRIELA: So I guess
you recognise me.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.160
YAZ: No.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.280
GABRIELA: Two Girls Roaming!

22:58.320 --> 22:59.760
I haven't seen it.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.640
What's the matter
with you people?

23:06.160 --> 23:09.480
(LABOURED BREATHING)

23:09.520 --> 23:10.840
YAZ: In here.

23:17.240 --> 23:18.920
Is that what we came for?

23:18.960 --> 23:19.960
Yeah.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.640
OK, so let's get out of here.

23:21.680 --> 23:23.440
It's connected
into the systems.

23:23.480 --> 23:25.480
I want to see what I can find.

23:25.520 --> 23:27.480
It looks like this lab

23:27.520 --> 23:30.280
is part of a triangulation
of signals

23:30.320 --> 23:32.840
with two other locations.

23:32.880 --> 23:35.240
One's Madagascar.

23:35.280 --> 23:36.960
Hide!

23:43.800 --> 23:46.400
YAZ: That's one
of the creatures Jake shot.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.360
GABRIELA: What is it doing?

23:53.040 --> 23:54.720
Whoa! Where did it go?

23:59.040 --> 24:00.680
What did it just do?

24:00.720 --> 24:02.520
It's a teleport station.

24:02.560 --> 24:03.920
We could follow it.

24:03.960 --> 24:05.600
Are you crazy?

24:06.680 --> 24:08.520
RYAN: So here's your present
from Peru.

24:11.720 --> 24:13.800
Ryan, will you dissect it
for me?

24:13.840 --> 24:15.000
What?!

24:15.040 --> 24:16.360
You must have done it
at school.

24:16.400 --> 24:17.760
Doesn't need to be elegant.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.680
Good! Cos it won't be.

24:19.720 --> 24:20.920
Nice lab.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.600
- Very well equipped.
- Thanks.

24:22.640 --> 24:23.920
Right. First things first.

24:23.960 --> 24:26.320
How are you off
for broad-spectrum antibiotics?

24:26.360 --> 24:27.520
- Yes, but only...
- Great!

24:27.560 --> 24:29.120
- ...a small supply.
- Graham!

24:29.160 --> 24:32.560
Jake. See if you can rig up
an IV.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.320
We need to get some medicine
into Adam,

24:34.360 --> 24:35.360
try and stabilise him.

24:35.400 --> 24:37.000
I have no idea how to do that.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.640
I'll give you a hand.

24:38.680 --> 24:41.200
I've seen a few
intravenous drips in my time.

24:41.240 --> 24:43.400
- Finally it comes in handy.
- I might need

24:43.440 --> 24:44.680
a high-powered microscope,

24:44.720 --> 24:46.760
blood cultures,
rapid genome sequencing,

24:46.800 --> 24:49.520
a spectrophotometer,
and a super-fast incubator.

24:49.560 --> 24:51.040
I've got most of that.

24:51.080 --> 24:53.880
Suki Cheng,
on a Madagascan beach,

24:53.920 --> 24:55.960
excellently equipped
and ready for anything.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.080
Ooh, can I use your computer?

24:58.480 --> 25:02.680
Right. I want to see
what's going on inside Adam.

25:02.720 --> 25:03.920
Gonna use your laptop

25:03.960 --> 25:06.920
to download the readings
I took from him earlier.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.520
- So what is it you do here?
- We're working on

25:10.560 --> 25:11.800
a marine filtration system

25:11.840 --> 25:13.480
connected into
the Crystal Oceans Initiative.

25:13.520 --> 25:16.120
Ah! Hence the water
filtration system.

25:16.160 --> 25:17.960
Micro version, is it?

25:18.000 --> 25:20.440
- You take a lot in very fast.
- Yes, I do.

25:20.480 --> 25:21.760
It's one of my skills.

25:21.800 --> 25:24.400
- (BEEP)
- Ah! Here we go.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.520
Initial blood analysis
for Adam.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.200
You OK, Doc?

25:40.280 --> 25:41.840
I'm sorry, Adam.

25:41.880 --> 25:43.880
Your bloodstream's
been infected

25:43.920 --> 25:45.680
with an alien pathogen,

25:45.720 --> 25:48.120
presumably in Hong Kong.

25:48.160 --> 25:51.240
Is it bad if I don't know
what a pathogen is?

25:51.280 --> 25:52.680
I'm glad you asked that,
cos I...

25:53.960 --> 25:56.000
- I didn't want to look stupid.
- It's a microorganism

25:56.040 --> 25:58.000
that carries disease.

25:58.040 --> 26:01.320
Alien bacteria, which is
latching on to life forms...

26:02.600 --> 26:04.360
...and killing them.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.640
I'm afraid it's inside you,
Adam,

26:06.680 --> 26:09.120
and right now I don't know how
we stop it overwhelming you.

26:20.360 --> 26:22.520
GABRIELA: You really want
to follow that creature.

26:23.760 --> 26:25.440
We're seriously
going to do this?

26:26.720 --> 26:28.240
Yeah.

26:28.280 --> 26:30.280
Without knowing
where we're going?

26:31.400 --> 26:32.400
Yeah.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.040
What's the worst place
we could end up?

26:37.080 --> 26:38.720
Long list.

26:38.760 --> 26:40.560
You don't want to know.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.360
You are crazy!

26:44.760 --> 26:46.480
Two girls roaming...

26:46.520 --> 26:47.800
Ready?

27:00.280 --> 27:02.240
I know you're worried
about your husband, mate,

27:02.280 --> 27:04.080
but he's in good hands
with the Doc.

27:05.440 --> 27:06.720
Just go away.

27:09.960 --> 27:13.440
What did he mean when he said,
"Seven months too late"?

27:18.840 --> 27:21.360
I was supposed to come out
and see him launch.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.720
Say goodbye
as he went off to the ISS.

27:25.400 --> 27:27.560
And you didn't go.

27:27.600 --> 27:30.040
He knew what he was taking on
with me.

27:30.080 --> 27:32.000
I don't do emotions.

27:33.160 --> 27:34.600
And I'm really not good at...

27:34.640 --> 27:36.920
...sticking with things,
you know? Commitment.

27:38.320 --> 27:41.080
Also, I really don't like
foreign travel.

27:41.120 --> 27:43.520
Wow. So you were
quite the catch, then.

27:47.920 --> 27:51.040
Yeah.
He's a lucky, lucky bloke.

27:52.760 --> 27:56.800
My husband is an astronaut.

27:56.840 --> 27:58.440
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

27:58.480 --> 28:00.680
being married to somebody
that impressive?

28:05.280 --> 28:06.720
It sort of sends me
the other way.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.840
I wallow in being unreliable.

28:09.880 --> 28:12.040
Like I'm punishing him.

28:12.080 --> 28:13.520
What for?

28:16.640 --> 28:17.920
Not being honest.

28:19.040 --> 28:20.840
No, sorry, you lost me.

28:20.880 --> 28:24.200
If he's that...impressive,
if he's that amazing...

28:26.360 --> 28:27.480
...which he is...

28:29.440 --> 28:31.360
...he can't love me
the way he says he does.

28:32.640 --> 28:34.880
It doesn't make sense.
Why would he?

28:39.160 --> 28:40.360
Oh, mate.

28:43.920 --> 28:45.800
I don't think he's the one
you're punishing.

28:56.680 --> 28:58.360
GABRIELA: We're still alive.

28:58.400 --> 29:00.120
We didn't die!

29:01.240 --> 29:03.920
Didn't teleport
into an active volcano.

29:03.960 --> 29:05.480
Result!

29:10.800 --> 29:12.200
What do you think this is?

29:12.240 --> 29:14.160
YAZ: Some sort of alien colony.

29:16.520 --> 29:17.720
Look at all this stuff.

29:20.160 --> 29:21.280
What even is it?

29:24.120 --> 29:26.440
If we're on an alien planet,

29:26.480 --> 29:27.880
then what is that?

29:41.840 --> 29:43.160
That...

29:44.560 --> 29:46.080
...is part of a submarine.

29:46.120 --> 29:47.440
SUKI: I've gene-sequenced

29:47.480 --> 29:49.480
blood cultures
from Adam and that bird.

29:49.520 --> 29:51.040
Wow, you are fast.

29:51.080 --> 29:52.840
If I track changes
in the optical density

29:52.880 --> 29:54.680
and confirm the bacteria's
growth rate,

29:54.720 --> 29:56.280
we might be able
to use that data

29:56.320 --> 29:58.080
to genetically engineer
a virus.

29:58.120 --> 29:59.480
That's what I was thinking!

29:59.520 --> 30:00.760
We're so sympa.

30:02.320 --> 30:05.720

GRAHAM: Doctor!

30:20.480 --> 30:22.480
Doc. Doc.

30:22.520 --> 30:24.880
Aramu says that the birds are
getting really angry out there.

30:24.920 --> 30:27.480
Not surprised, if this is
what their insides are like.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.520
Take a look.

30:29.560 --> 30:31.280
They're full of plastic.

30:31.320 --> 30:34.200
Once plastic gets in the ocean,
birds mistake it for food.

30:34.240 --> 30:36.160
I've seen hatchlings
regurgitate

30:36.200 --> 30:37.560
200 individual pieces.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.200
It's feasting on the plastic
in the birds

30:39.240 --> 30:40.680
and taking them over!

30:40.720 --> 30:43.120
The alien pathogens
attacked the plastic.

30:43.160 --> 30:45.760
The plastic metastasized
as if it was living.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.440
Oh...

30:47.480 --> 30:49.080
Autons?

30:49.120 --> 30:50.280
No, it can't be Autons.

30:50.320 --> 30:52.520
They don't work like this.
Not bacterial.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.840
Come on, brains! Move it along!

30:54.880 --> 30:56.120
(WHISPERS) Did she say "brains"
plural?

30:56.160 --> 30:57.920
How does that explain
what happened to Jamila?

30:57.960 --> 30:59.960
Like, she just got taken over.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.720
Yeah. How does it? It attacks
the plastic in the birds,

31:02.760 --> 31:04.600
but there's no plastic
in humans.

31:04.640 --> 31:05.800
Except...

31:05.840 --> 31:07.400
Oh!

31:07.440 --> 31:09.200
Microfiltration!

31:12.120 --> 31:14.400
Hey, Doc.
That's not a thought -

31:14.440 --> 31:16.120
- that's just a random phrase.
- No, no, no.

31:16.160 --> 31:17.920
That's a very big thought.

31:17.960 --> 31:21.680
The microfiltration system
in the water.

31:21.720 --> 31:24.280
- It filters out...
- BOTH: ...microplastics!

31:24.320 --> 31:25.960
Alien bacteria

31:26.000 --> 31:27.920

31:27.960 --> 31:29.720

are full of them!

31:29.760 --> 31:31.400
Excuse me,
I'm not full of plastic.

31:31.440 --> 31:33.560
- Full of something.
- I'm afraid you are, Graham.

31:33.600 --> 31:36.880
It's in the air, it's in
your food, it's in your water.

31:36.920 --> 31:38.760
Humans have flooded this planet
with plastics

31:38.800 --> 31:41.280
that can't be fully
broken down, so much so

31:41.320 --> 31:43.600
that you're ingesting
microparticles,

31:43.640 --> 31:45.200
whether you know it or not!

31:45.240 --> 31:48.120
You're poisoning yourselves
as well as your planet.

31:48.160 --> 31:50.560
An alien bacteria
has come to this planet,

31:50.600 --> 31:52.400
and it found a feast.

No. Look!

See what the bird's natural
enzymes are doing.

Oh, yeah. Clear as mud.

Ryan Sinclair picks up
a dead bird in Peru

32:52.360 --> 32:54.880

have saved the world.

32:54.920 --> 32:57.120
Well, I am here for you guys,
you know.

32:57.160 --> 32:59.400
If we isolate and boost
the enzyme, then splice them,

32:59.440 --> 33:01.000
we'd have one
supercharged virus.

33:01.040 --> 33:02.680
Yes, we would.

33:02.720 --> 33:05.120
Yaz, how are you doing?
Cos we've literally got

33:05.160 --> 33:07.840
the most exciting rotting bird
that I've ever seen.

33:07.880 --> 33:09.600
I don't want you to panic...

33:09.640 --> 33:12.000
...but we followed one of those
things through a teleport,

33:12.040 --> 33:13.680
and now I think
we're on an alien planet.

33:13.720 --> 33:15.520
Well, you don't do things
by halves.

33:15.560 --> 33:18.600
Also, I think we found
the missing submarine.

33:18.640 --> 33:21.360
Not sure how that got here.
Oh, and another thing.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.440

was sending data

of the Indian Ocean...

is in Madagascar...

Yaz.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
Look.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.640
Looks like it was
trying to get somewhere

36:23.680 --> 36:24.880
but its injuries were too bad.

36:24.920 --> 36:26.480

the TARDIS will make more.

37:30.120 --> 37:32.880
Thanks for coming to get us.
Eventually!

37:32.920 --> 37:34.680
Look at you, going off on your
own and not getting killed!

37:34.720 --> 37:35.840
Plus, totally found

37:35.880 --> 37:37.200
- an alien colony.
- (WHIRRING)

37:38.360 --> 37:40.200
Sort of.
It is an alien construct,

37:40.240 --> 37:41.840
but it's not an alien colony.

37:41.880 --> 37:43.880
RYAN: Then where are we?

37:43.920 --> 37:46.000
DOCTOR: A long way below
the Indian Ocean.

37:51.080 --> 37:54.040
Beneath a gyre
of plastic pollution.

37:54.080 --> 37:56.480
- We're under the sea?!
- It's a naturally occurring

37:56.520 --> 37:58.960
hot spot where ocean currents
trap pollution.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.760
There are five major gyres
on Earth right now.

38:01.800 --> 38:04.040
Praxeus is attracted
to plastic.

38:04.080 --> 38:06.680
It's built a whole environment
here from the plastic,

38:06.720 --> 38:08.880
a world of pure Praxeus!

38:08.920 --> 38:10.640
This is where it all started.

38:10.680 --> 38:13.240
Seabirds infected with Praxeus

38:13.280 --> 38:15.960
transporting the bacteria
around the world,

38:16.000 --> 38:17.920
transferring it to humans

38:17.960 --> 38:19.760
- when they attack!
- But how does

38:19.800 --> 38:21.520
an alien bacteria
end up in the Indian Ocean

38:21.560 --> 38:23.520
- in the first place?
- (WHIRRING)

38:23.560 --> 38:25.720
There's something else
down here,

38:25.760 --> 38:28.320
and I think it's connected
to our friend Suki.

38:28.360 --> 38:30.000
Come on.

38:32.200 --> 38:34.400
What are you
looking like that for?

38:34.440 --> 38:37.440
Thought I'd discovered
an alien planet on my own.

38:41.640 --> 38:43.480
We're at the bottom
of the Indian Ocean?

39:03.400 --> 39:04.560
How are you feeling?

39:07.920 --> 39:09.440
Dying.

But not human.
Infected with Praxeus,

39:59.000 --> 40:00.640
but the body
hasn't disintegrated.

40:00.680 --> 40:02.520
Must be due
to the different biology.

40:02.560 --> 40:03.960
I don't get it.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.840
Why were these guys
experimenting on Adam?

40:05.880 --> 40:08.080
Maybe for the same reasons
we are.

of one, yes.

40:47.960 --> 40:50.440
Just when I thought things
couldn't get any madder.

40:51.240 --> 40:54.480
- Ooh.
- How did you get here?

40:55.920 --> 40:57.240
I was going to ask you
the same question,

40:57.280 --> 41:00.880
but I presume that ship is how.
So the question is...why?

41:02.760 --> 41:05.400
Praxeus devastated my planet.

41:05.440 --> 41:07.240
The survivors
were assigned to lab ships

41:07.280 --> 41:10.040
to find an antidote
for the few of us left alive.

41:11.360 --> 41:13.040
You're infected too.

41:13.080 --> 41:15.200
Cellular mutation
is slower for us.

41:15.240 --> 41:16.680
If you're scientists
in lab ships,

41:16.720 --> 41:18.080
please tell me you didn't

41:18.120 --> 41:20.400
bring this infection here
deliberately.

41:23.840 --> 41:26.120
Praxeus breeds in plastic,

41:26.160 --> 41:28.280
and this planet
is saturated in it.

41:28.320 --> 41:30.040
We travelled across
three galaxies to find

41:30.080 --> 41:31.600
the perfect living laboratory.

41:31.640 --> 41:34.200
To use Earth as a Petri dish,

41:34.240 --> 41:37.120
destroying one race to save
the remnants of your own!

41:38.360 --> 41:40.520
But this down here,
this environment,

41:40.560 --> 41:42.160
it wasn't deliberate.

41:43.480 --> 41:45.200
We lost control of the shuttle
on entry.

41:45.240 --> 41:46.240
Crash-landed.

41:46.280 --> 41:49.400
The bacteria flooded out,
irradiated, formed this world.

41:49.440 --> 41:52.360
And a broken spacecraft

41:52.400 --> 41:55.440
sending out pulses of energy
from the bottom of the ocean

41:55.480 --> 41:58.160
was enough to down and frazzle
a returning space capsule.

41:58.200 --> 42:01.920
This is the centre of where
everything's been happening!

42:01.960 --> 42:04.800
Your arm. You've been scratched
by those birds.

42:04.840 --> 42:07.040
You've had a double dose
of Praxeus.

42:07.080 --> 42:08.760
But you showed me
how to find a cure!

42:08.800 --> 42:10.760
Thanks to you, my mission
was successful. They already

42:10.800 --> 42:12.840
have the transmission
of how the cure could work.

42:12.880 --> 42:14.880
No! Suki, the cure is designed
for humans,

42:14.920 --> 42:17.040
and we don't even know
if it works on them.

42:17.080 --> 42:18.160
If you're not human,

42:18.200 --> 42:20.080
who knows what will happen?

42:21.200 --> 42:23.520
Please tell me you haven't
administered it on yourself.

42:26.320 --> 42:27.640
Stay out of my way.

42:30.760 --> 42:32.240
Stay here.

42:37.080 --> 42:38.640
Suki! Listen to me!

42:38.680 --> 42:40.320
We can work together on this.

42:40.360 --> 42:42.160
- Get out of here!
- I wouldn't use that in here.

42:42.200 --> 42:44.400
Not with those reverse-pulse
proton engines.

42:44.440 --> 42:46.880
Very unreliable.
No wonder you crashed.

- Sortable, though.

for you, and then we can

taken over by Praxeus!

Succumbed to Praxeus.
But I think this may

43:41.960 --> 43:44.200
give us a way through.
I need a crew in here.

43:45.480 --> 43:47.200
- Count us in.
- Hi.

43:48.920 --> 43:50.960
Turns out...

43:51.000 --> 43:52.680
...it worked.

43:53.960 --> 43:55.960
- Your machine spat this out.
- That's the antidote.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.040
And by the way,
where the hell are we?

43:58.080 --> 44:00.680
Follow me! Lots to do.

44:00.720 --> 44:02.560
Engine vents on. Apparently.

44:02.600 --> 44:05.200
System set to automated
timed venting. I think.

44:05.240 --> 44:07.160
Manual bypass...bypassed.

44:07.200 --> 44:09.120

- Just testing!

loaded with Praxeus antidote.

44:14.080 --> 44:17.520

with Praxeus-killing virus,

Autopilot system set
for the Earth's stratosphere,

44:26.480 --> 44:29.640
check. All systems set
for automation.

44:29.680 --> 44:32.080
No idea what any of this means,
but is that literally

44:32.120 --> 44:33.480
the controls for up, down,
left and right?

44:33.520 --> 44:34.640
Yeah.

44:34.680 --> 44:36.920
Adam Lang, your job is so easy!

autopilot take-off.

44:40.200 --> 44:41.920
Gold stars
for my apprentice engineers.

44:41.960 --> 44:43.680
What is actually happening?!

44:43.720 --> 44:46.240
Once the ship
is in the stratosphere,

44:46.280 --> 44:49.760
the engines discharge the virus
in one superpowered burst,

44:49.800 --> 44:53.800
dispersing it around the world,
killing Praxeus stone dead.

44:53.840 --> 44:55.360
Hopefully.

44:55.400 --> 44:57.560
Only one tiny flaw in the plan.

44:57.600 --> 45:00.120
Send this into the atmosphere,
it'll rip a hole in this world,

45:00.160 --> 45:03.440
and we'll be crushed under
the entire Indian Ocean.

45:03.480 --> 45:05.720
That's more than a tiny flaw,
Doc!

45:05.760 --> 45:07.960
And that's why
I set the autopilot.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.480
So everybody out, now.

45:13.040 --> 45:15.080
Go!

45:17.520 --> 45:19.840
- What was that?
- Autopilot failure.

45:19.880 --> 45:21.080
It can't connect.

45:21.120 --> 45:22.040
It's gonna work, though, right?

45:22.080 --> 45:23.720
I don't know. It might not.

45:23.760 --> 45:25.120
But it's definitely going
to take off.

45:25.160 --> 45:26.320
We need to get out of here!

45:26.360 --> 45:27.440
JAKE: What if it doesn't work?!

45:27.480 --> 45:29.440
Too late to fix! Come on.

45:34.080 --> 45:36.600
Got to be fast taking off!

45:40.600 --> 45:41.880
Where's Jake?

45:45.080 --> 45:47.520
- Where's Jake?!
- YAZ: He was right behind us.

45:47.560 --> 45:48.600
JAKE: Are these comms on?

can you hear me?

45:52.160 --> 45:53.640
Jake, what are you doing?!

45:53.680 --> 45:55.520
Manual pilot making up
for broken autopilot.

45:57.840 --> 46:00.200
Any idiot can fly a spaceship,
right?

46:00.240 --> 46:01.880
Jake...

46:01.920 --> 46:04.040
I don't want this.

46:04.080 --> 46:05.840
Maybe I do.

46:07.160 --> 46:08.400
Maybe I need this.

46:08.440 --> 46:10.720
You're entering
into the stratosphere!

46:12.240 --> 46:15.360
Yeah, that really doesn't
mean anything to me!

46:15.400 --> 46:17.120
But if I was a betting man -

46:17.160 --> 46:19.040
and my husband would tell you
I really am -

46:19.080 --> 46:21.800
I'd say the automatic release
is bust.

46:21.840 --> 46:23.680
Tell me what I need to do!

46:23.720 --> 46:26.360
The controls by your right hand
will vent the antidote.

46:26.400 --> 46:29.520
You need to flick
the three switches at once.

46:29.560 --> 46:31.120
I'm going to give it a go!

46:32.040 --> 46:33.840
The ship's gonna break up.

46:33.880 --> 46:34.840
DOCTOR: Jake, you have to wait

46:34.880 --> 46:36.320
until the shuttle's
in the right position.

46:36.360 --> 46:38.200
Adam?

46:40.400 --> 46:41.600
Adam!

46:41.640 --> 46:43.800
I'm sorry I wasn't
at the launch.

46:45.320 --> 46:47.680
This is me not dodging.

46:49.160 --> 46:51.280
Don't say
I never listened to you!

46:51.320 --> 46:52.640

Shuttle's in position, Jake.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.360

46:56.400 --> 46:57.760
...I think.

47:53.320 --> 47:55.320
Just...
if I materialise around him

47:55.360 --> 47:57.440
in the millisecond
before the ship breaks up.

47:57.480 --> 47:58.800
Nice work, Doc.

47:58.840 --> 48:00.480
What can I say?

48:00.520 --> 48:02.480
I'm a romantic.

48:14.920 --> 48:16.400
DOCTOR: I guess
this is goodbye, then.

48:16.440 --> 48:17.920
YAZ: Keep the planet safe
for us.

48:17.960 --> 48:20.560
Cos we'll be coming back,
so it'd better be in good nick.

48:20.600 --> 48:22.240
Or we'll know who to blame!

48:22.280 --> 48:25.480
- Thank you.
- Our pleasure. Really.

48:25.520 --> 48:26.840
Although I have to say,

48:26.880 --> 48:28.880
worst thing about
saving the human race -

48:28.920 --> 48:30.400
nobody knows it was me.

48:30.440 --> 48:32.280
Least I could get was a statue!

48:32.320 --> 48:34.640
So what's the plan now
for you two?

48:34.680 --> 48:36.840
Dunno.
Spend some time together.

48:38.080 --> 48:39.160
We never had a honeymoon,

48:39.200 --> 48:40.520
because he didn't want
to go abroad.

48:40.560 --> 48:41.720
Maybe now's the time.

48:41.760 --> 48:43.320
- I'll come with you!
- How's that a honeymoon

48:43.360 --> 48:44.680
if you're with us?

48:44.720 --> 48:46.200
We can vlog about it!

48:46.240 --> 48:48.160
What you gonna call it?
Three Idiots Roaming?

48:48.200 --> 48:49.840
I like it! It's snappy!

48:49.880 --> 48:51.120
And factual.

48:51.160 --> 48:53.000
Yeah, you guys can go now.

48:53.040 --> 48:54.800
We'll take the planet
from here.

48:55.920 --> 48:57.000
Hey!

48:57.040 --> 48:58.680
Come find us some time.

49:00.880 --> 49:02.240
DOCTOR: Planet Earth.

49:02.280 --> 49:03.880
Seven billion lives,

49:03.920 --> 49:06.840
separate and connected.

49:06.880 --> 49:08.840
From the edge of
the atmosphere

49:08.880 --> 49:11.200
to the depths of the ocean.

49:44.040 --> 49:45.120
DOCTOR: Welcome to Aleppo!

49:45.160 --> 49:49.040
MAN: Your worst fears.
My creativity.

49:49.080 --> 49:50.280
Who are you?

49:50.320 --> 49:52.800
Get everyone out.
