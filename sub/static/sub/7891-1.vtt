# Doobie doobie doobie #

00:30.797 --> 00:34.164
# Doo doo doo doobie doo doo #

00:34.200 --> 00:37.601
# Doobie doo doobie

00:37.637 --> 00:41.403
# Doobie doo doo
doobie doo doo #

00:41.441 --> 00:42.567
# Ah. #

01:15.708 --> 01:18.007
Guess who's coming back?

01:18.211 --> 01:21.703
That's right... legendary
soul surfer Steve Addington...

01:22.982 --> 01:24.745
- "The Nature Boy."

01:24.784 --> 01:27.651
After six months of surfing
around the world

01:27.687 --> 01:30.212
on the biggest and
most famous breaks...

01:30.256 --> 01:33.007
Teahupoo, Raglan,
J-Bay,

01:33.259 --> 01:35.454
Mundaka, Frigates...

01:35.495 --> 01:37.122
he's surfed it all.

01:37.163 --> 01:41.395
Malibu's own Steve Addington
is coming home.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.231
The Ben and Barry poster-boy

01:43.269 --> 01:46.500
is now signed with surfing icon
and television producer

01:46.539 --> 01:48.700
Eddie Zarno.

01:48.741 --> 01:50.800
Malibu, California,

01:50.844 --> 01:53.904
is now hosting the coolest
reality show of the summer.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.245
The best surfers
from around the globe

01:56.282 --> 01:58.807
will be living in this house...

01:58.852 --> 02:02.288
and partying with
these girls.

02:02.322 --> 02:04.483
Welcome back, Add-Man.

02:04.524 --> 02:06.355
We'll see you soon.

02:30.517 --> 02:32.508
Next.

02:36.389 --> 02:38.380
Occupation?

02:38.424 --> 02:40.483
Surfer.

02:40.527 --> 02:44.486
Is that a job: surfer?

02:44.531 --> 02:47.967
Not really.

02:49.135 --> 02:51.126
What were you doing in Fiji?

02:51.171 --> 02:55.130
Surfing epic lefts at Frigates.

02:59.412 --> 03:00.811
Where'd the cash come from?

03:00.847 --> 03:02.712
That's from Ben and Barry.

03:02.749 --> 03:04.979
Who's Ben and Barry?

03:05.018 --> 03:08.476
I wear Ben's shorts, right?
Surf Barry's boards.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.614
Those dudes send me checks.

03:10.657 --> 03:12.147
How long you staying stateside?

03:12.192 --> 03:14.183
Long enough to catch
some buglass,

03:14.227 --> 03:16.422
check in with my brothers,
keep the stoke. You know?

03:17.430 --> 03:19.022
Stoke?

03:19.065 --> 03:20.828
Stoke.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.061
You know.

03:23.069 --> 03:24.229
Uh-huh.

03:28.374 --> 03:29.807
Welcome home.

03:31.444 --> 03:32.672
Cool.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.014
Check this out, man.

03:37.317 --> 03:40.753
- # Do you feel it in the sunshine? #
- This fucking asshole.

03:40.787 --> 03:43.255
- # Do you feel it in the rain? #
- Fuck off, man.

03:43.289 --> 03:45.985
# Do you feel it in the ocean #

03:46.025 --> 03:48.823
# When the waves are clean? #

03:48.861 --> 03:52.024
# Do you feel it in the evening #

03:52.065 --> 03:54.966
# When the moon is up? #

03:55.001 --> 03:57.731
# Do you feel it in your bones #

03:57.770 --> 04:00.603
# When she fills you up? #

04:02.542 --> 04:04.169
# Ooh yeah yeah #

04:04.210 --> 04:06.405
# She breathes good luck #

04:06.446 --> 04:09.108
# Mother Earth, Mother Earth... #

04:09.148 --> 04:10.615
- Hello?
- Dude.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.709
Addington!

04:18.156 --> 04:20.954
It's the muffler you wanted.
It's classic.

04:20.994 --> 04:23.087
No, I like it.
It's just...

04:23.129 --> 04:25.290
I'm looking for something with
a little more boom,

04:25.331 --> 04:27.322
you know?

04:27.367 --> 04:28.766
# Do you feel it when you... #

04:28.801 --> 04:31.497
Get the fuck out of my shop.

04:33.006 --> 04:35.338
# Do you feel it on the mountains? #

04:35.375 --> 04:37.309
- I love your hose.
- Thank you.

04:38.978 --> 04:42.971
- # Do you feel it on the water? #
- Excuse me.

04:45.618 --> 04:48.109
- What?
- # Ooh yeah yeah... #

04:48.154 --> 04:49.951
Yeah!

04:55.295 --> 04:57.991
Long time! Long time!

04:58.031 --> 04:59.828
# Ooh yeah yeah #

04:59.866 --> 05:04.462
# She's breathes good luck,
Mother Earth, Mother Earth #

05:06.205 --> 05:07.934
# She breathes good luck #

05:55.254 --> 05:56.881
# Ooh yeah yeah #

05:56.923 --> 05:59.414
# She breathes good luck #

05:59.459 --> 06:01.893
# Mother Earth, Mother Earth #

06:01.928 --> 06:05.591
# She breathes good luck... #

06:13.740 --> 06:15.765
Man, Addy's home.

06:15.808 --> 06:17.776
- Jacko, man!
- Jack.

06:17.810 --> 06:19.607
Hey!

06:19.645 --> 06:21.840
- Hey, mate.
- Yeah.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.815
Where's Luanne and
the kids? You bring 'em?

06:23.850 --> 06:26.444
Oh, no, changing diapers,
wiping spit...

06:26.486 --> 06:30.047
Beware of what you love, brother,
because it can drive you mad.

06:30.089 --> 06:33.616
Listen... hey, you talk
to Ben and Barry?

06:33.659 --> 06:35.388
No. They stoked?

06:35.428 --> 06:37.521
Stoked? No.
They're gone.

06:37.563 --> 06:39.724
- They die?
- No no.

06:39.766 --> 06:41.996
They sold out
to Eddie Zarno.

06:42.034 --> 06:45.697
They're poolside at
the Four Seasons in Bali

06:45.738 --> 06:47.069
getting their grendals twisted...

06:47.106 --> 06:49.870
Eddie Zarno... surfer, Eddie Zarno?
He's cool, right?

06:49.909 --> 06:52.377
Well, you know what?
We hope he's cool

06:52.412 --> 06:54.607
because, dude,
as your manager,

06:54.647 --> 06:56.137
I'm telling you,

06:56.182 --> 06:59.515
we got worries.
We got financial worries, bro.

06:59.552 --> 07:01.452
Not today we don't, brother.

07:01.487 --> 07:03.250
I just got back in town.
I got no...

07:03.289 --> 07:06.258
- We got worries, dude.
- Let's talk business tomorrow.

07:06.292 --> 07:08.226
Definitely tomorrow, bro.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.695
No worries, brother.
Come here, give me a hug.

07:10.730 --> 07:13.198
- Here we are.
- Okay, bro.

07:13.232 --> 07:14.927
- Mmmm!
- Okay.

07:14.967 --> 07:16.696
- No worries.
- You're right.

07:16.736 --> 07:19.261
I don't know why I'm stressing.
Everything's gonna be okay.

07:19.305 --> 07:20.772
Everything's gonna be cool, man.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.275
# Ooh yeah yeah #

07:24.310 --> 07:26.437
# She breathes good luck #

07:26.479 --> 07:28.674
# Mother Earth, Mother Earth. #

07:30.616 --> 07:32.345
Hey, Charlie.
How's it going?

07:37.390 --> 07:39.051
Hello, Danielle.

07:39.091 --> 07:41.218
I thought we'd talk
about your decision

07:41.260 --> 07:43.490
to work in Los Angeles.

07:43.529 --> 07:45.895
What's the joke?

07:45.932 --> 07:49.095
California, like "granola"?

07:49.135 --> 07:52.036
What ain't nuts and fruits
is flakes.

07:52.071 --> 07:54.232
You could use
a little granola, Dad.

07:54.273 --> 07:57.299
When's the last time
you wore a pair of shorts out?

07:57.343 --> 07:59.709
Honey, I just think
that you're being rash.

07:59.745 --> 08:02.646
Anything that you can learn there,
you can learn at one of my companies.

08:02.682 --> 08:05.207
I mean, Malibu and
reality television?

08:05.251 --> 08:08.186
That's... that's your decision?

08:08.221 --> 08:10.348
Exactly.

08:12.859 --> 08:16.158
Well, I give you one week
with those weirdos.

08:16.195 --> 08:18.254
I don't want to be unreasonable,
bro, but there's waves.

08:18.297 --> 08:21.130
Okay, but, dude,
you have completely tarnished

08:21.167 --> 08:22.998
the California work ethic.

08:23.035 --> 08:26.368
Bro, I know you're trying to run
a mowing business and all,

08:26.405 --> 08:29.499
- but there's swell.
- I just want you to know, dude,

08:29.542 --> 08:32.375
you just harshed
my morning mellow, okay?

08:32.410 --> 08:34.572
Jack, please, don't be
unreasonable.

08:34.614 --> 08:36.808
I'll mow the fucking lawn later.
What's going on...

08:36.849 --> 08:39.510
Page 35, "Killer Surf."
Well, so,

08:39.552 --> 08:42.783
if you get time, why don't you
come on in and do your job?

08:42.822 --> 08:44.083
It's going off in Leo, Jack...

08:46.359 --> 08:48.259
Dude, when's the last time
you had a wave?

08:48.294 --> 08:50.626
There's no telling, bro.

08:50.663 --> 08:54.622
I mean, these guys are not exactly
committed to lawn care.

08:54.667 --> 08:56.862
Most of these machines
are on the fritz.

08:56.903 --> 08:59.804
I got bills up to my crack.

08:59.839 --> 09:02.205
And Luanne is pissed at me.

09:02.241 --> 09:05.574
And just, this Ben and Barry situation...
I'm gonna lose my mind.

09:05.611 --> 09:08.341
- I'm gonna lose my mind.
- Let's blow through this, bro.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.815
10 minutes, we're into
some decent swell.

09:10.850 --> 09:15.116
Dude, let's take a moment
and assess the situation.

09:15.154 --> 09:18.885
You have no assets,
you have no savings,

09:18.925 --> 09:23.487
you rent your Malibu pad and you're
way too generous with your cash.

09:23.529 --> 09:26.020
Stuff's like manure, bro:
you don't spread it around,

09:26.065 --> 09:27.726
- it starts to...
...stink up the place.

09:27.767 --> 09:30.964
But, dude,
we need fertilizer.

09:31.003 --> 09:34.996
We gotta, like, fertilize
the money tree so it can keep growing.

09:35.041 --> 09:37.805
About that, bro, could you
float me a few bills, man?

09:39.512 --> 09:41.980
Yeah. Yeah, sure, dude,
but look...

09:42.014 --> 09:44.505
Ah, you know,

09:44.550 --> 09:47.246
Zarno... we gotta go see him.

09:47.286 --> 09:50.881
And... and... and if we
don't make a deal,

09:50.923 --> 09:53.824
then we're gonna
be wiped out.

09:53.859 --> 09:55.326
Wiped out?
Come on, Jacko.

09:55.361 --> 09:57.386
Well... ooh! No.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.694
But, like, you know,

09:59.732 --> 10:03.793
you... you have got to
go shake Zarno's hand.

10:03.836 --> 10:06.396
Okay.
Just spendthrifty, okay?

10:06.439 --> 10:07.633
Listen, bro...

10:09.642 --> 10:13.078
Brother, I got no trouble
shaking a surfer's hand.

10:13.112 --> 10:14.670
Ha ha ha!

10:14.714 --> 10:16.749
Mmm.

10:19.051 --> 10:21.110
This is Zarno's pad, dude?

10:22.655 --> 10:25.021
- You cool?
- Yeah.

10:25.057 --> 10:26.524
Anyway, it's his reality house.

10:26.559 --> 10:30.552
Dude, the gray on gray...

10:30.596 --> 10:33.463
I mean, like, gray does...

10:33.499 --> 10:35.899
Something's wrong
with these fish, dude.

10:37.737 --> 10:40.171
Gentlemen.

10:40.206 --> 10:42.902
Eddie Zarno.
My apologies.

10:42.942 --> 10:44.637
Conference call
with the board...

10:44.677 --> 10:47.612
launch details,
marketing emergencies.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.875
- It happens.
- Yeah.

10:48.914 --> 10:51.815
I told them to stick it
for a minute 'cause Steve Addington

10:51.851 --> 10:53.614
and his representation
were in my den.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.486
- And hey, dude, this place rocks.
- Yeah.

10:56.522 --> 11:00.481
Man, I was telling Jack,
I saw footage of you in Sardinia

11:00.526 --> 11:03.017
crushing Porto Ferro, bro.
Man, killer cutback.

11:03.062 --> 11:04.825
Cool, yeah.
Now I cut deals.

11:04.864 --> 11:07.094
That's what I'm talking about.

11:07.133 --> 11:10.398
Jack Mayweather.
God damn!

11:10.436 --> 11:12.631
Only Steve Addington
could have a manager so cool.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.232
- I don't know...
- Mr. Zarno?

11:15.274 --> 11:17.333
Excuse me. Yeah?

11:17.376 --> 11:19.435
- Mr. La Rosa's asking for evidence.
- Good, right?

11:19.478 --> 11:21.776
Oh, God. All right.
Guys, I'm sorry.

11:21.814 --> 11:24.442
I got some more hand-holding to do.
Margaret, my assistant,

11:24.483 --> 11:26.610
will show you around,
show you the house,

11:26.652 --> 11:29.780
show you the game... you.
Guys, we'll talk soon.

11:29.822 --> 11:31.050
All right?

11:31.090 --> 11:32.421
Cool guy.

11:32.458 --> 11:33.982
Gentlemen?

11:34.026 --> 11:35.755
Follow me.

11:35.795 --> 11:37.729
This is our nerve center.

11:37.763 --> 11:40.425
You can see the entire home here
on our monitors...

11:40.466 --> 11:44.835
weight room, kitchen,
our spacious grounds.

11:44.870 --> 11:47.031
Ah, that's your room,
Steven.

11:47.073 --> 11:51.567
You have a perfect view of Malibu's Point
Dume from both windows.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.873
The house is early
Klaus Woo.

11:54.914 --> 11:56.848
- Who?
- Woo.

11:56.882 --> 11:59.112
- Oh.
- Post-post-modernist revival.

11:59.151 --> 12:01.915
- Oh.
- Notice the strong lines

12:01.954 --> 12:03.615
and the perfect circles,

12:03.656 --> 12:07.888
as if to conjure the line of
the horizon and the molecules.

12:07.927 --> 12:11.727
The house used to belong to
a very distinguished porn star...

12:11.764 --> 12:14.790
This place is so...

12:14.834 --> 12:17.029
- so...
- Okay?

12:17.069 --> 12:18.593
Gentlemen.

12:18.637 --> 12:21.105
This place is so...

12:22.108 --> 12:25.600
Have you ever experienced
a first-person-emersion video game?

12:25.644 --> 12:28.807
I've dropped a few quarters
into Donkey Kong.

12:28.848 --> 12:31.783
This place is so...

12:31.817 --> 12:33.751
pretty.

12:33.786 --> 12:35.253
Follow me.

12:35.287 --> 12:37.551
We're calling it "Free Surfer."

12:37.590 --> 12:41.959
It's in beta,
available next Christmas.

12:41.994 --> 12:43.757
Catchy title.

12:43.796 --> 12:46.094
Put them on your head.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.691
I don't want to
put them on my head.

12:49.735 --> 12:51.134
It's the future.

12:51.170 --> 12:54.105
It's the future, bro.
Take a peek.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.998
All right.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.408
Welcome to the digital revolution.

13:03.449 --> 13:04.677
Right.

13:05.751 --> 13:06.740
Whoa.

13:12.691 --> 13:14.124
April May.

13:14.160 --> 13:18.494
It's going off.

13:39.685 --> 13:41.653
Whoa, bro.

13:41.687 --> 13:44.349
You all right?

13:44.390 --> 13:45.550
Ahh.

13:45.591 --> 13:48.958
I don't mean to be complaining
'cause we're not complainers,

13:48.994 --> 13:50.427
but I was curious...

13:50.462 --> 13:53.863
what exactly do you need
Add here for?

13:53.899 --> 13:54.888
Ahh.

13:54.934 --> 13:56.834
We can simulate surfing,

13:56.869 --> 14:00.532
but we can't simulate great surfing
without great surfers.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.063
Oh. Oh.

14:02.107 --> 14:04.166
Now that makes sense.

14:04.210 --> 14:05.973
Please.

14:06.011 --> 14:09.174
- Whoo.
- Ho ho ho ho ho.

14:09.215 --> 14:11.149
- Nice. Nice.
- Hey,

14:11.183 --> 14:13.515
Zarno went all out, huh?

14:13.552 --> 14:15.782
Look at this...
that's La Rosa.

14:15.821 --> 14:19.188
He's finishing
a sequencing session.

14:19.225 --> 14:22.456
That's how we capture your
personal surfing style.

14:22.494 --> 14:25.088
That's how we'll create
the Addington avatar.

14:25.130 --> 14:27.325
He's a good surfer, man.

14:27.366 --> 14:29.800
Hard charger.

14:31.937 --> 14:33.495
What's happenin', bro?

14:35.441 --> 14:38.035
Thought you'd be better looking,

14:38.077 --> 14:40.238
have longer arms
or something.

14:40.279 --> 14:42.907
I can't hear you, bro.

14:44.617 --> 14:47.347
Gracias, mamá.

14:47.386 --> 14:50.549
It's my world now, mamao.

14:50.589 --> 14:51.954
We need you in hair and makeup.

14:51.991 --> 14:53.049
Wow.

14:53.092 --> 14:56.220
- Dude looks upset.
- Truly.

14:56.262 --> 14:59.197
Okay, people, let's reset the rig...

14:59.231 --> 15:01.631
Looks cold in there, bro.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.100
- Frigid.
- Uh, sorry,

15:03.135 --> 15:05.330
there's no smoking in here.

15:10.976 --> 15:12.409
Brill, shut it.
Baker, please.

15:12.444 --> 15:14.036
Addington, continue.

15:15.047 --> 15:17.982
Ben and Barry
wouldn't digitize me.

15:18.017 --> 15:20.485
That's Steve Addington.

15:20.519 --> 15:22.384
- Brillo, please...
- The surfer.

15:22.421 --> 15:23.547
...I will come over there.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.523
I'll tell you something else, man:

15:26.759 --> 15:29.694
Video games,
reality TV,

15:29.728 --> 15:31.821
Free Surfer...

15:31.864 --> 15:34.424
I mean, what the fuck is that, man?

15:35.567 --> 15:38.195
I'm not some ass-clown
in a green room.

15:38.237 --> 15:39.795
- I'm a surfer, dude.
- Yes.

15:39.838 --> 15:42.136
Hi.

15:42.174 --> 15:44.472
- I'm Stacey.
- Good day.

15:44.510 --> 15:46.671
- This is my friend Danni.
- Hello.

15:46.712 --> 15:47.872
- Hey, how are you?
- Hey.

15:47.913 --> 15:49.938
We're working for the reality show.

15:49.982 --> 15:53.179
- East Coast?
- New York.

15:53.218 --> 15:55.743
Do you mind if we shoot you?

15:55.788 --> 15:57.517
No, roll away.

16:02.027 --> 16:05.087
So you're not going
to do Free Surfer?

16:05.130 --> 16:08.429
I hear La Rosa's getting over
$100,000 in residuals...

16:08.467 --> 16:10.367
- What?
- $100,000?

16:10.402 --> 16:13.496
...and exposure worth twice that.
- Yeah!

16:13.539 --> 16:15.632
It's like getting a map
to buried treasure.

16:15.674 --> 16:18.268
Except it's not buried.
It's dangling there

16:18.310 --> 16:21.006
like a big fat grape.

16:21.046 --> 16:23.606
- I love grapes.
- But who picked that grape, bro?

16:23.649 --> 16:27.813
Seriously, migrants, you know?
Exploited farmers, man.

16:27.853 --> 16:30.981
La Rosa's little niece probably had
to pick that grape, man,

16:31.023 --> 16:32.650
- in Oxnard.
- Dude.

16:32.691 --> 16:34.056
Wow.

16:35.094 --> 16:37.255
- Not feeling it.
- Yeah.

16:37.296 --> 16:38.456
Not into it.

16:38.497 --> 16:42.866
I just want to surf,
keep the stoke day to day.

16:42.901 --> 16:44.892
Quality thinking, man.

16:44.937 --> 16:46.962
You get all that?

16:47.973 --> 16:49.463
Got it.

16:50.609 --> 16:52.941
Later, East Coast.

16:52.978 --> 16:54.536
- See ya.
- Bye.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.571
Nice meeting you.
Blowing it.

16:56.615 --> 16:57.912
Blowin' it.

17:02.688 --> 17:05.179
- Add-Man.
- Farmer Bob.

17:09.228 --> 17:11.093
Get in this house.

17:11.130 --> 17:13.758
- From my garden, brother.
- Homegrown.

17:13.799 --> 17:15.425
Thank you very much.

17:15.467 --> 17:17.935
Speaking of homegrown...

17:17.970 --> 17:20.097
"au naturale."

17:20.138 --> 17:22.232
Under the sun...

17:22.273 --> 17:23.866
Topanga Gold.

17:23.909 --> 17:25.342
Bless the flowers...

17:25.377 --> 17:27.902
- Bless the weed. Amen to that, brother.
...bless the weed.

17:27.945 --> 17:29.811
How long we got you for?

17:29.848 --> 17:31.941
I'm gonna chill
local-style for awhile...

17:31.984 --> 17:34.248
the summer, at least.
Yeah.

17:35.421 --> 17:38.686
The usual for the goats.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.351
Keep 'em on
the farm roaming free.

17:40.392 --> 17:41.950
You're way too generous.

17:41.994 --> 17:44.690
They call it "courtesy"
for a reason, brother.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.130
Wanna paddle out?

17:47.166 --> 17:48.690
It's been a while.

17:50.269 --> 17:52.396
I best be about
my father's business.

17:52.438 --> 17:54.133
Cool.

17:54.173 --> 17:56.903
Me too, brother.
Me too.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.770
- What goes down...
...gotta come up!

18:18.497 --> 18:20.965
April May, look at you.

18:20.999 --> 18:22.796
- Look at you.
- Ahh.

18:22.835 --> 18:26.931
Did you feel that wind kick up?

18:26.972 --> 18:30.135
El Niño may be paying us
an early visit.

18:30.175 --> 18:32.837
I heard you're gonna be one of
the surfers on the reality show.

18:32.878 --> 18:34.607
Nn-nnh.

18:34.646 --> 18:38.673
Nah, I'm gonna stay here,
surf and work the garden.

18:38.717 --> 18:40.810
Just picture it, okay?

18:40.853 --> 18:43.321
You and me,
the stars of it,

18:43.355 --> 18:45.084
- just rulin' it.
- Mmm.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.592
Promise me you'll think about it.

19:01.206 --> 19:03.333
Aha ha ha.

19:04.409 --> 19:06.309
- To the waves.
- Jesus.

19:06.345 --> 19:08.210
She hurts me, bro.

19:08.247 --> 19:11.045
I don't know about her, dudes.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.983
She's the siren, bro.

19:13.018 --> 19:15.953
I want to mark her with
my scent like a lemur.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.324
This helps.

19:22.361 --> 19:24.727
I'm not some ass-clown...

19:24.763 --> 19:26.560
...l'm a surfer, dude.

19:26.598 --> 19:29.658
- That's excellent footage.
- Thanks.

19:29.701 --> 19:32.864
It's really useful stuff.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.896
Kind of a scoop there, isn't it?

19:35.941 --> 19:38.705
Which one of you was behind
the camera here at the end?

19:38.744 --> 19:41.008
- Um, you did.
- Me.

19:41.046 --> 19:43.241
I was actually
interviewing and she was...

19:43.282 --> 19:46.649
- Would you excuse us a minute?
...video games, reality TV...

19:52.558 --> 19:55.356
- So... Danni, is that right?
- Yeah.

19:55.394 --> 19:59.091
You're obviously educated, smart...

19:59.131 --> 20:01.190
cultured perhaps.

20:01.233 --> 20:03.292
I did my thesis on
vertical integration:

20:03.335 --> 20:05.599
owning production through
distribution and retail.

20:05.637 --> 20:07.696
Yeah, well, lesson one:

20:07.739 --> 20:11.004
get the content.
Well, you know that already,

20:11.043 --> 20:12.738
don't you?

20:12.778 --> 20:16.236
So did Addy say anything else?
Anything off-camera?

20:16.281 --> 20:19.341
No, except what he said
which was pretty much "No."

20:19.384 --> 20:22.217
Right, well, he's playing hard to get.
He'll come around.

20:22.254 --> 20:24.518
They all come around eventually.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.419
Looked like you two
had a little moment.

20:31.463 --> 20:32.487
I'm sorry?

20:32.531 --> 20:34.396
I saw the tape,

20:34.433 --> 20:37.698
the way he looked at you.
Are you gonna deny it?

20:37.736 --> 20:39.533
Yeah, I deny it.

20:46.011 --> 20:48.571
You can go now.

20:50.682 --> 20:53.742
Wave that money!
You look so beautiful. Mira.

20:53.785 --> 20:57.312
Ay, coño, mamá,
you ever taste La Rosa, baby?

20:57.356 --> 20:59.756
It's like Sabritos, but better.
That's right!

20:59.791 --> 21:01.258
Pa', Eddie, díla.

21:03.128 --> 21:05.460
- Hey, ladies.
- Chocolate y Snowflake.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.859
Surfers living and partying...

21:09.901 --> 21:11.835
- Hey! Hey hey!
...under one roof,

21:11.870 --> 21:14.065
- fighting for waves on one beach.
- Addington, Addington!

21:14.106 --> 21:16.336
- Addington!
- 24 hours a day,

21:16.375 --> 21:18.206
it's one sizzling summer.

21:18.243 --> 21:20.268
It's gonna be hot.

21:20.312 --> 21:24.544
Australia's big-wave rider,
Johnny Doran...

21:24.583 --> 21:26.608
I like huge waves,

21:26.652 --> 21:30.281
Catholic sheilas
and beets on my burger.

21:30.322 --> 21:31.550
I love that guy.

21:31.590 --> 21:34.252
...Lupe La Rosa:
shredder sensation

21:34.293 --> 21:36.284
from Puerto Rico...

21:36.328 --> 21:38.125
Hey, kids, how you doin'?

21:38.163 --> 21:40.893
You want my autograph?
Who wants some Red Bull, huh?

21:40.932 --> 21:41.921
Yeah!

21:41.967 --> 21:44.367
Just business.
That's "Lupe."

21:44.403 --> 21:47.702
...and Malibu's own legendary
soul surfer,

21:47.739 --> 21:49.434
Steve Addington.

21:49.474 --> 21:50.907
Who?

21:50.942 --> 21:53.069
He's scared I outsurf him.

21:53.111 --> 21:54.908
Hey, Steve!

21:54.946 --> 21:57.380
- It's...
...going...

21:57.416 --> 21:58.405
...off.

21:59.418 --> 22:02.444
Premiering this summer,
from the mind of surf icon,

22:02.487 --> 22:03.681
Eddie Zarno.

22:03.722 --> 22:06.350
What! Watching that.

22:06.391 --> 22:08.552
Thought you passed on
the wave porn, bro.

22:08.593 --> 22:10.151
I did.

22:10.195 --> 22:12.789
Dude, we saw it
and we loved it

22:12.831 --> 22:17.131
and, you know, I'm still not sure
why you're down on this show.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.228
I said no, dude.

22:19.271 --> 22:21.296
I know, bro, but, like...

22:21.340 --> 22:23.865
he's pissed, you know?

22:23.909 --> 22:25.843
Zarno apparently got ahold
of some video

22:25.877 --> 22:28.072
of you passing on his project

22:28.113 --> 22:30.445
in a way that
didn't sit too well with him.

22:30.482 --> 22:34.111
Yeah, I said "No dice" in no
uncertain terms, and I meant it.

22:34.152 --> 22:38.919
Why do you want to discriminate
against all those poor landlocked kids

22:38.957 --> 22:42.859
like in Kansas who are gonna
watch you on this thing

22:42.894 --> 22:45.590
and realize that there is something
cooler in the world

22:45.630 --> 22:48.428
than a house made of corn?

22:48.467 --> 22:49.627
What?

22:49.668 --> 22:53.001
Dude, how are you
sitting for cash?

22:54.139 --> 22:56.004
A handful.

22:56.041 --> 22:59.408
Well, then why don't you just
stroll on down the hill

22:59.444 --> 23:01.969
and smile and be charming
and be cool

23:02.013 --> 23:04.846
and be Addington, you know?

23:04.883 --> 23:08.046
Maybe something cool will happen.

23:08.086 --> 23:11.419
Man, like I said, I got no problem
shaking a surfer's hand,

23:11.456 --> 23:14.357
brother, but I'm not living there.
Cool?

23:14.393 --> 23:18.557
Okay, dude, but remember:
mind open, heart enlarged,

23:18.597 --> 23:20.895
soul receptive.

23:22.434 --> 23:24.163
- I love you.
- You too, brother.

23:27.806 --> 23:30.274
Please. Please.
You're killing me, man.

23:30.308 --> 23:32.071
- Let's go.
- Boom!

23:32.110 --> 23:33.270
Ho ho ho!

23:34.813 --> 23:37.281
# You see me? #

23:49.795 --> 23:52.559
- Whoa!
- I love America.

23:52.597 --> 23:54.565
I had no idea.

23:58.804 --> 24:00.396
Yes!

24:00.439 --> 24:02.134
Excuse me?

24:19.658 --> 24:23.059
You put the green pepper,
red pepper, garlic, onion,

24:23.094 --> 24:25.824
y mucho amor... you need
the loving in your life, papi, right?

24:25.864 --> 24:29.027
Anybody know where Eddie is?

24:29.067 --> 24:31.126
Oye, mamao, can't you
see I'm cooking?

24:31.169 --> 24:33.603
What's up, La Rosa, bro?

24:33.638 --> 24:37.369
Man, I saw you talking trash
on TV the other day.

24:37.409 --> 24:38.603
What gives?

24:38.643 --> 24:40.941
"What gives"?
I'll tell you what gives.

24:40.979 --> 24:44.779
You and your free-surfing-country-soul
vibe, that's what gives.

24:44.816 --> 24:48.183
It's about 30 years late, papi.
That shit can't compete.

24:49.988 --> 24:51.819
I'm not competing, bro.

24:51.857 --> 24:54.325
Well, I'm not buying it, bro.

24:54.359 --> 24:55.826
I ain't selling it.

24:55.861 --> 24:59.854
Oh, whoa whoa.
I need all cameras in the kitchen.

25:00.966 --> 25:02.729
You got nothing I need.

25:02.767 --> 25:04.359
Hey.

25:04.402 --> 25:06.302
I thought about
what you said

25:06.338 --> 25:08.829
and we're just not
gonna work out.

25:08.874 --> 25:10.398
- Ooh.
- What?

25:10.442 --> 25:12.967
I'm with Lupe now.
I'm sorry.

25:13.011 --> 25:15.479
I'm just looking for Eddie, man.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.142
You can go home
and cry now, Steven.

25:37.669 --> 25:39.603
- Hey, dude.
- Aw, man.

25:39.638 --> 25:42.038
- It's good to see you again, Steven.
- Likewise.

25:42.073 --> 25:43.335
It really is.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.071
We're excited to have you...
the coolest surfer in the world.

25:46.111 --> 25:47.476
Yeah.

25:50.215 --> 25:52.979
- Hard work, fella!
- That's right, fella!

25:53.018 --> 25:54.542
Come on.

25:54.586 --> 25:57.953
Grass is perfect
and we cut it, man.

25:57.989 --> 25:59.047
Why?

26:09.734 --> 26:12.362
You used to walk everywhere
yourself, huh?

26:12.404 --> 26:14.531
- You stopped, man. Why'd you stop?
- Oh, no.

26:15.874 --> 26:18.968
Was it that reef bounce
at Mavs, man?

26:19.010 --> 26:20.568
Oh, you heard about that.

26:20.612 --> 26:23.308
Saw that.
It was heavy, man.

26:23.348 --> 26:27.045
Steven, Ben and Barry asked me
to personally take care of you.

26:27.085 --> 26:30.350
Not that they had to,
'cause numbers don't lie.

26:30.388 --> 26:31.719
- Numbers?
- Numbers, Steven.

26:31.756 --> 26:34.919
It's all about the, numbers.
And yours, my friend, add up.

26:34.960 --> 26:36.291
- Margaret?
- Yep?

26:36.328 --> 26:39.388
Just need your signature on these
saying you'll participate fully

26:39.431 --> 26:41.331
in my projects.

26:43.802 --> 26:46.498
Dude, we were just chilling,
surfer to surfer.

26:46.538 --> 26:50.565
There are times in life
when years of preparation

26:50.609 --> 26:53.077
meet the moment
of opportunity.

26:53.111 --> 26:55.841
This is that moment for you.

26:58.183 --> 27:00.515
Checks.

27:00.552 --> 27:02.816
This is actually stoked, bro.

27:04.823 --> 27:06.757
What up, bro?
Those are for me, aren't they?

27:06.791 --> 27:08.782
They're for you, yes,
as soon as you sign,

27:08.827 --> 27:10.692
saying you'll participate
in Free Surfer

27:10.729 --> 27:13.027
and live in my house.

27:14.366 --> 27:17.233
I told you, man,
I'm not signing.

27:19.437 --> 27:21.962
I'm not participating, you know?

27:22.007 --> 27:24.441
It's not personal, Eddie.

27:24.476 --> 27:27.138
I'm trying to tell you, I'm...

27:27.178 --> 27:30.306
I surf.
All right, I'm a surfer...

27:30.348 --> 27:31.781
out there.

27:34.019 --> 27:36.112
Steven, I want you
to remember something here,

27:36.154 --> 27:37.883
and don't forget this, huh?

27:37.922 --> 27:40.288
You're in advertising.

27:40.325 --> 27:42.759
Ben and Barry
never paid you to surf.

27:46.097 --> 27:48.565
Jack's got my number.

27:48.600 --> 27:52.832
You tell him to call
when you start "feeling it."

28:10.588 --> 28:13.648
Heeeeey.

28:13.692 --> 28:14.852
Wait a minute.

28:29.074 --> 28:31.542
What about that?

28:32.644 --> 28:34.407
What about that?

28:34.446 --> 28:36.539
I was acting.

28:36.581 --> 28:39.880
They told me to play
like I wanted him.

28:41.052 --> 28:43.145
But I want you there.

28:43.188 --> 28:44.951
You do?

28:48.626 --> 28:50.389
What do you want?

28:57.168 --> 28:59.261
That's good there.

29:38.143 --> 29:41.476
Truly epic night, brothers.

29:41.513 --> 29:43.378
I just want to go on record...

29:46.551 --> 29:49.543
Report said "surf."
That's a lake.

29:51.556 --> 29:53.524
Oh, bro.

29:56.828 --> 29:59.160
Something's off, dudes.

30:12.811 --> 30:15.211
No bueno, mate. No bueno.

30:30.295 --> 30:33.093
Música, música. Come on,
party, people.

30:33.131 --> 30:34.428
Follow me.

30:39.504 --> 30:42.064
Lupe's so cool. Aww!

30:43.174 --> 30:46.143
Back to the sofrito, mi gente,
because I did not forget about you.

30:46.177 --> 30:48.338
We got 20 cameras outside.
We can cut to anything we want.

30:48.379 --> 30:50.347
We edit as we go.
There's hardly any post.

30:50.381 --> 30:52.315
It's sexy, it's happening,
it's fast. We got...

30:52.350 --> 30:55.114
I mean, we can...
if anything gets old,

30:55.153 --> 30:57.280
like... like this. Hello?

30:57.322 --> 30:59.381
Come on, I don't want shots
of girls talking.

30:59.424 --> 31:00.789
Is this better?

31:00.825 --> 31:02.656
Good.

31:02.694 --> 31:05.561
That shit goes across
demographics, huh?

31:05.597 --> 31:08.589
And next week, Addington drops in.
Boom... it's fantastic.

31:25.750 --> 31:27.877
What the fuck?

31:27.919 --> 31:31.855
Hey, man, look... Socrates
recommended the dialectic

31:31.890 --> 31:34.085
when faced with
such an impasse, man.

31:34.125 --> 31:36.685
You know?
You ask me a question,

31:36.728 --> 31:39.162
I respond with
something to build on

31:39.197 --> 31:43.327
and a conversation is formed,
out of which answers are revealed.

31:43.368 --> 31:45.632
Mm-hmm.
Where are the waves?

31:45.670 --> 31:47.695
I don't know, man.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.832
Something's bogus, dudes.

31:51.709 --> 31:54.473
B-O-G-U-S.

31:54.512 --> 31:56.412
I gotta compensate.

31:56.447 --> 31:57.846
"No entiendo," dude.

31:57.882 --> 32:01.249
No no no, he speaks
of reciprocity, bros...

32:01.286 --> 32:04.153
balance in the energy
that binds us, man.

32:04.188 --> 32:07.214
There are no separate deeds, man.

32:07.258 --> 32:09.488
You know, read Heisenberg, man.

32:09.527 --> 32:13.987
You know, we affect... by looking
at that tree, you affect that tree, man.

32:14.032 --> 32:15.465
You make it real, man.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.365
Yeah yeah, thanks.
You've been really helpful.

32:17.402 --> 32:19.563
Sacrifices, bro.

32:19.604 --> 32:22.334
Measure for measure.

32:22.373 --> 32:24.273
I gotta take action.

32:24.309 --> 32:28.769
Whoa whoa whoa,
what kind of action?

32:28.813 --> 32:31.611
No more women
till we get waves.

32:31.649 --> 32:33.116
Yeah, good one.

32:35.653 --> 32:38.053
No more weed, either,
not till we get waves.

32:38.089 --> 32:40.887
Hey, you know, let's not
take it too far, man.

32:43.594 --> 32:46.757
First off, fuck that.
And second off, yeah, fuck that.

32:46.798 --> 32:49.631
There's philosophy and then there,
you know, there's life, man...

32:49.667 --> 32:51.294
Why don't you just blow
my fucking balls off?

32:51.336 --> 32:54.134
- and physics, man.
Butterfly effect, man.

32:54.172 --> 32:57.164
Mate, you're the ass-cutting
chosen one.

32:57.208 --> 32:59.267
Hey, stone crab...

32:59.310 --> 33:02.768
you love stone crab, huh?

33:02.814 --> 33:04.714
You could stop eating
stone crab.

33:04.749 --> 33:06.239
- Right.
- Give it up.

33:06.284 --> 33:08.514
No, bros.

33:08.553 --> 33:10.453
I'm fasting.

33:12.190 --> 33:14.715
- I got nothing.
- I got nothing.

33:14.759 --> 33:16.590
Ah, we gotta vacate.

33:16.627 --> 33:19.528
Indo, Gold Coast...
wherever it's going off...

33:19.564 --> 33:21.293
I'm taking us.

33:21.332 --> 33:23.027
- That means we're gonna surf?
- That means we're gonna surf.

33:26.304 --> 33:28.636
- Did Jack Mayweather call?
- No, sir.

33:32.043 --> 33:33.806
Okay,

33:33.845 --> 33:36.279
tell Perez to prep
the Addington tape.

33:36.314 --> 33:37.372
Yes, sir.

33:37.415 --> 33:39.246
And tell him to cancel
his plans for the evening.

33:39.283 --> 33:40.443
Yes, sir.

33:42.053 --> 33:44.385
And put a hold on
his expense accounts.

33:44.422 --> 33:45.684
Whose?

33:46.691 --> 33:49.717
- Addington's.
- Oh, yes, of course. Sorry.

33:49.761 --> 33:53.561
Um, which ones?

33:53.598 --> 33:55.327
All of them.

33:58.236 --> 34:00.636
Went to Surf Liquor.

34:00.671 --> 34:03.765
Fucknut must have frozen
your tab there too.

34:03.808 --> 34:05.833
Really upset Baker.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.812
That tab was the one
pure thing in my life.

34:08.846 --> 34:11.940
Herb will get you through
times with no money

34:11.983 --> 34:15.475
better than money will get you
through times with no herb.

34:15.520 --> 34:19.183
I tried. I looked. I called. I met.

34:19.223 --> 34:22.556
No one can touch you with Zarno
owning your contracts.

34:22.592 --> 34:26.255
I need waves, Jack.

34:26.297 --> 34:28.060
Waves.

34:30.967 --> 34:34.301
Hey, what about
that sticker thing?

34:34.338 --> 34:37.000
You know?
The logo idea.

34:38.109 --> 34:40.703
Oh, that's kinda...

34:40.745 --> 34:42.212
personal, isn't it?

34:42.246 --> 34:45.237
Exactly. Great.
Man, he loves you.

34:45.283 --> 34:48.741
It's just... it's probably
just a communication problem.

34:48.786 --> 34:52.949
Tell him that you will
push the product. That's money to him.

34:54.725 --> 34:58.286
I mean, it's all we got.
I don't know what else to do.

34:59.730 --> 35:01.197
Hey!

35:02.467 --> 35:04.264
- Mmm.
- Hey.

35:04.302 --> 35:07.066
- "Under the sun."
- Yeah.

35:07.105 --> 35:10.836
Everything is under it, right?

35:10.875 --> 35:14.072
The surf, chicks,
good loving, good times...

35:14.112 --> 35:17.741
anything you're into,
happening "au naturale"

35:17.782 --> 35:19.682
- under...
...the sun.

35:19.717 --> 35:21.082
- The sun!
- The sun!

35:21.119 --> 35:24.418
Yeah.
And it's something that Addington

35:24.455 --> 35:28.789
has been so mad passionate about
for, like, ever.

35:28.826 --> 35:30.987
Stickers.

35:31.028 --> 35:32.791
You can put it on anything.

35:32.830 --> 35:35.663
- You know, your television...
- Surfboard.

35:35.700 --> 35:38.362
- Your wall.
- Your laptop.

35:38.402 --> 35:39.767
Your dog.

35:40.938 --> 35:42.303
If you shave it.

35:42.340 --> 35:44.467
Okay. Okay, all right.

35:44.509 --> 35:46.670
Look... wow.

35:46.711 --> 35:50.306
Well, I've listened,
I've considered,

35:50.348 --> 35:54.148
and the answer's no.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.643
Not feelin' it.

35:56.687 --> 36:00.248
Now are you ready
to come to work or what?

36:00.291 --> 36:02.418
- Dude...
- Excuse me.

36:02.460 --> 36:04.052
...be cool.

36:04.095 --> 36:06.290
What's it gonna be?

36:06.330 --> 36:09.356
Fun under my sun
or Fuck City?

36:09.400 --> 36:12.301
Whoa. Whoa whoa whoa, dude.

36:12.336 --> 36:14.964
Wait a minute, man.
I'm seriously about to pound you.

36:15.006 --> 36:17.839
Man, do you understand that?

36:19.610 --> 36:22.408
Are you gonna turn
my travel card back on

36:22.446 --> 36:24.004
- or what?
- Okay. Whoa whoa.

36:24.048 --> 36:26.482
Mama! Here we go!
Here we go.

36:26.517 --> 36:28.815
This is the anger
I've been looking for.

36:28.853 --> 36:31.413
This is the big-wave passion
I need for the show.

36:31.455 --> 36:33.116
Huh? Oh, it's beautiful.

36:33.157 --> 36:34.920
It's beautiful, anger.
Am I right?

36:34.959 --> 36:37.018
Yeah, fantastic anger.
Really good stuff.

36:37.061 --> 36:38.858
- What the fuck?
- You're gonna love this.

36:38.896 --> 36:40.955
- Roll the tape.
- I'll tell you something else:

36:40.998 --> 36:43.831
Surfing's lame, dude.

36:43.868 --> 36:47.167
- Surfers... they're ass-clowns.
- Enjoy.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.196
And I'm not feeling it.

36:50.508 --> 36:52.373
Not into it.

36:52.410 --> 36:55.004
Into video games,
reality TV.

36:55.046 --> 36:58.948
Lying cocksucker fascist
bastard asshole

36:58.983 --> 37:01.747
- son of a crooked fuck.
- They're ass-clowns.

37:01.786 --> 37:03.253
I'm gonna kill him!

37:03.287 --> 37:05.187
And I'm not feeling it.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.852
Not into it.
Into video games...

37:08.893 --> 37:11.088
Oh my God.

37:11.128 --> 37:14.564
Oh, baby,
the magic of montage.

37:14.599 --> 37:16.066
How was that for a moment, huh?

37:16.100 --> 37:17.897
You cannot do this,

37:17.935 --> 37:20.233
- you unethical, unprincipled...
- Careful.

37:20.271 --> 37:22.239
...scumbag asshole.

37:22.273 --> 37:24.537
- Fired.
- No shit.

37:24.575 --> 37:27.476
Those with the gold
make the rules, sweetpea.

37:27.511 --> 37:29.945
- Remember that.
...surfing's lame...

37:29.981 --> 37:31.915
Cut to three here.
I want to see it.

37:31.949 --> 37:33.109
Going to three.

37:33.150 --> 37:36.119
- Hello, Steven.
...not feeling it.

37:38.022 --> 37:39.148
Jack?

37:39.190 --> 37:42.125
Hey, we got some Free Surfer hoodies
for you at the end of the hall there,

37:42.159 --> 37:44.992
if you're getting cold.

37:45.029 --> 37:47.429
...video games and reality TV.

37:47.465 --> 37:49.092
Look, it's King Shit.

37:49.133 --> 37:50.998
...surfing's lame.

37:51.035 --> 37:54.402
Whuh-oh!
It's macho man.

37:55.606 --> 37:57.233
You got cajones, papi.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.505
- Here we go.
- Addington,

37:59.543 --> 38:01.033
this has got to stop.

38:01.078 --> 38:03.945
- You're sort of stalking me.
- What?

38:03.981 --> 38:06.609
You messing around
with my bitch, mamao?

38:06.651 --> 38:08.585
Nothing happened.

38:08.619 --> 38:10.280
Believe me, he tried.

38:11.956 --> 38:14.982
Hi, East Coast,
you seen Jack?

38:15.026 --> 38:16.653
Whoa whoa whoa!

38:16.694 --> 38:18.753
Yeah, baby!

38:18.796 --> 38:21.356
Coño!
That's the one-hitter quitter, papi.

38:21.399 --> 38:22.889
How you like that?

38:22.933 --> 38:24.924
Good night, Steven.

38:24.969 --> 38:27.802
Addington? Steve?

38:29.073 --> 38:32.565
I can't believe this is happening.
This is so great.

38:32.610 --> 38:35.374
Please, I feel awful.

38:37.348 --> 38:39.646
- Jack?
- He's with the police.

38:39.684 --> 38:42.244
He threw a brick
at Zarno's car.

38:42.286 --> 38:45.050
His car?
He threw it at Zarno.

38:45.089 --> 38:46.681
A brick?

38:46.724 --> 38:49.659
And a bottle.
They took him to jail.

38:51.729 --> 38:54.061
- Addington?
- Danni?

38:55.800 --> 39:00.328
Steve Addington just said
your name with his dying breath.

39:00.371 --> 39:03.863
This is so romantic.
It's like a Jane Austen novel.

39:24.995 --> 39:26.792
Hey.

39:51.622 --> 39:53.647
Welcome to Breakline.

39:53.691 --> 39:55.852
To check for surf, press one.

39:57.395 --> 40:01.058
Those breaks are flat flat flat

40:01.098 --> 40:02.497
and flat.

40:12.943 --> 40:14.877
- Hey.
- Oh.

40:14.912 --> 40:16.675
Ah, hi.

40:16.714 --> 40:18.739
Um, good morning.

40:18.783 --> 40:21.115
Excuse me, who are you?

40:21.152 --> 40:22.881
I'm Stacey.

40:22.920 --> 40:25.616
- Right.
- You're in my apartment...

40:25.656 --> 40:27.123
me and Danni's.

40:28.826 --> 40:31.056
Oh.

40:31.095 --> 40:33.529
Hey, Stacey, did...

40:33.564 --> 40:34.963
did we...

40:34.999 --> 40:38.264
Oh, um, yeah... no.

40:39.303 --> 40:42.568
But you're up now.

40:45.276 --> 40:46.743
Juice?

40:48.112 --> 40:50.046
No.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.445
Thank you, though.

40:52.450 --> 40:55.442
- Muffin?
- I'm fasting.

40:55.486 --> 40:56.145
No.

41:05.629 --> 41:07.654
Hey, Luanne.

41:08.799 --> 41:12.326
Why are those dudes driving off
with Jack's mowers?

41:12.369 --> 41:14.667
We have many lawns
but no one to push them.

41:14.705 --> 41:17.333
I don't know what else to do.
Business is bad.

41:17.374 --> 41:18.671
We need the money.

41:18.709 --> 41:20.677
I have to go, Addington.

41:20.711 --> 41:22.736
I have to visit Jack
in jail now.

41:24.415 --> 41:26.781
Oh, it's all right, baby.

41:28.686 --> 41:30.551
Oh, Jack.

41:32.590 --> 41:35.252
That's fucking Steve Addington
right there, man.

41:35.292 --> 41:37.556
That long-haired hippie
was talking shit on YouTube.

41:37.595 --> 41:39.495
Throw your fucking
burrito at him.

41:42.099 --> 41:43.794
Eat that, ass-clown.

41:48.739 --> 41:51.071
Enjoy the breakfast!

42:09.059 --> 42:10.754
Hello?

42:13.764 --> 42:15.925
Hello?

42:15.966 --> 42:17.934
It's Danni.

42:19.003 --> 42:20.994
Hello?

42:24.375 --> 42:26.036
Steve?

42:27.144 --> 42:28.907
You okay?

42:28.946 --> 42:30.607
Quick,

42:30.648 --> 42:34.015
don't just do something;
stand there.

42:34.051 --> 42:36.019
What?

42:36.053 --> 42:38.317
I'm waiting.

42:38.355 --> 42:40.653
but I'm trying not
to even do that.

42:40.691 --> 42:43.285
What is that, like,
Zen or something?

42:44.295 --> 42:47.992
It's whatever waiting
without waiting is.

42:49.700 --> 42:51.725
What are you waiting for?

42:52.736 --> 42:54.397
Waves.

42:54.438 --> 42:57.305
Well, I'm sorry, Steve...

42:57.341 --> 42:59.571
- but, you know, I was just
listening to the radio

42:59.610 --> 43:01.874
and they said there isn't gonna be
a rideable wave

43:01.912 --> 43:04.437
on the California coast
for days, at least.

43:04.481 --> 43:06.972
South, maybe, in Mexico.

43:11.455 --> 43:13.548
Mexico.

43:15.960 --> 43:18.258
- You got wheels?
- Um, do... do...

43:18.295 --> 43:22.755
Uh, I got Stacey's...
Stacey's truck.

43:22.800 --> 43:24.791
Yeah yeah yeah.
I know a cat.

43:24.835 --> 43:26.928
If it's breaking in Baja,

43:26.971 --> 43:28.734
it's breaking at Greenbough's.

43:28.772 --> 43:30.637
Go to Mexico!

43:30.674 --> 43:32.733
Mexico!

43:34.478 --> 43:36.275
Ahem.

43:40.451 --> 43:42.578
Can I just say something?

43:42.620 --> 43:45.919
I feel I need to apologize
for what happened with Zarno

43:45.956 --> 43:48.516
and my footage.
I did not...

43:48.559 --> 43:49.992
No, I know, I know.
It's cool.

43:50.027 --> 43:51.688
You don't want an explanation?

43:51.729 --> 43:53.526
I didn't say what
they had me saying,

43:53.564 --> 43:55.293
so I don't need that
explained to me.

43:57.468 --> 43:59.197
Check that glovebox.

44:01.105 --> 44:03.096
Go on.

44:03.140 --> 44:04.971
Yeah.

44:27.498 --> 44:29.966
Mr. Zarno,
there are three guys at the gate

44:30.000 --> 44:32.400
looking for Addington.
I think they're friends of his.

44:32.436 --> 44:34.199
- Shall I let them in?
- Yes.

44:34.238 --> 44:36.297
Are you kidding me?
Yes, let them in, definitely.

44:36.340 --> 44:37.967
And ask them
where the fuck is Addington?

44:38.008 --> 44:40.101
Of course, ladies, you can lick Lupe.

44:40.144 --> 44:43.307
Anytime... Oh, mira!
The three mamaos.

44:44.948 --> 44:47.314
Yeah, let them in.
It's okay.

44:47.351 --> 44:50.149
Ladies, continue licking.
Don't stop.

45:19.149 --> 45:21.845
Ahhhh!

45:26.490 --> 45:27.923
- Ahhh!
- Oh!

45:27.958 --> 45:30.290
Hi.

45:30.327 --> 45:32.420
You scared me.

45:32.463 --> 45:35.398
Best to breathe, then... deeply.

45:39.002 --> 45:40.765
There's nothing
we can do for him, Chip.

45:40.804 --> 45:45.070
The transplant didn't take.
We're lifeguards, not lawyers.

45:49.880 --> 45:51.074
Hello?

45:51.115 --> 45:53.310
- Hi.
- Where's my truck?

45:53.350 --> 45:55.545
I am so sorry.

45:55.586 --> 45:57.884
I took it to Mexico
with Steve Addington.

45:59.456 --> 46:02.721
- Stacey?
- You disgusting slut!

46:02.760 --> 46:06.127
Okay, um, I can't really
talk right now,

46:06.163 --> 46:09.155
but I will be back
as soon as I can.

46:09.199 --> 46:10.496
I promise.
Is that okay?

46:10.534 --> 46:13.094
Not without details, it isn't.
And I mean right now.

46:13.137 --> 46:14.934
- I gotta go.
- No no no no no no...

46:14.972 --> 46:16.667
No!

46:27.851 --> 46:29.716
Americano?

46:29.753 --> 46:31.482
What you do in tree?

46:32.856 --> 46:35.450
Looking for waves, buddy.

46:38.662 --> 46:40.653
Waves are in ocean,

46:40.697 --> 46:42.187
not tree.

46:42.232 --> 46:45.633
No, waves are not
in ocean, buddy...

46:45.669 --> 46:48.137
so I'm in tree.

46:56.947 --> 46:58.847
Hey, americano,

46:58.882 --> 47:00.645
We make big crazy fire.

47:00.684 --> 47:01.912
Look at him...

47:01.952 --> 47:05.513
it would break my heart
if he didn't look so pathetic.

47:07.491 --> 47:10.016
When he was yea high,

47:10.060 --> 47:12.551
he'd hitch rides down
from Topanga,

47:12.596 --> 47:15.258
watching us surf
till the last wave.

47:15.299 --> 47:17.699
His mom left him up there
with some far-out folks

47:17.734 --> 47:19.827
who let him grow up outside,

47:19.870 --> 47:22.202
follow what he loved.

47:22.239 --> 47:25.697
- And he loved to surf.
- Is crazy.

47:27.010 --> 47:29.342
Like it answered all his questions.

47:29.379 --> 47:30.937
Americano?

47:32.249 --> 47:33.944
Until now.

47:35.285 --> 47:37.480
So there's never been
a drought like this before?

47:37.521 --> 47:40.388
Nah... not for him.

47:40.424 --> 47:41.982
No! No no no no...

47:42.025 --> 47:43.959
So how come you're not
going crazy then?

47:43.994 --> 47:45.791
I mean, you're a surfer too.

47:45.829 --> 47:47.592
I fish.

47:48.599 --> 47:51.397
Add's got nothing but waves.

47:53.070 --> 47:54.435
Whoa!

47:56.006 --> 47:58.065
¿Qué pasó? Are you okay?

47:58.108 --> 48:00.576
I think I put
too much gas on it.

48:07.184 --> 48:09.982
Mi corazon's...

48:10.020 --> 48:12.113
it's muy heavy.

48:14.524 --> 48:16.355
I know, amigo.

48:16.393 --> 48:18.088
I know.

48:43.287 --> 48:46.552
Americano, ¡no hay nada allí!

48:46.590 --> 48:48.581
There is nothing there!

48:50.360 --> 48:52.328
- Yes, a huge show.
- Right.

48:52.362 --> 48:54.057
- A hit show; it'll go through the roof.
- Yes, I know...

48:54.097 --> 48:55.962
- Huge ad buy...
- Eddie, I know, I know!

48:55.999 --> 48:58.297
Listen, where is this guy,
Steve Addington?

48:58.335 --> 49:00.326
Addington?

49:00.370 --> 49:02.930
Yeah, Addington!
Listen, Simons says...

49:02.973 --> 49:04.440
- Yeah.
...you promised him Addington.

49:04.474 --> 49:06.465
He's seeing La Rosa on the tape.
He's not seeing Addington.

49:06.510 --> 49:09.741
Listen, I will have Steve Addington
under control very soon.

49:09.780 --> 49:11.270
Under control!
What the fuck does that mean?

49:32.269 --> 49:34.260
Dressed from head to foot

49:34.304 --> 49:35.464
in black.

49:35.505 --> 49:38.372
# Break it up, wind it up,
one, two, three #

49:38.408 --> 49:41.844
# Now you're ready
to roll with me... #

49:45.182 --> 49:46.274
Hurry up, Brillo.

49:46.316 --> 49:48.147
Guapa, mi gente, huh?

49:48.185 --> 49:50.085
Fuck if you're cutting, La Rosa.

49:50.120 --> 49:53.146
Yeah, "da da da da da da da!"
Don't think so, "papi."

49:53.190 --> 49:55.556
Pero, amigos,
we're friends, right?

49:55.592 --> 49:57.617
¿Familia?

50:02.199 --> 50:04.531
How is he?

50:06.870 --> 50:08.462
Not very good.

50:08.505 --> 50:10.996
He hasn't eaten anything
and he's pacing.

50:11.041 --> 50:12.941
Pacing? That's bad.

50:12.976 --> 50:15.809
- This was good.
- What's that?

50:15.846 --> 50:17.746
Well...

50:17.781 --> 50:21.615
this is a big, fucking monster bud.

50:21.651 --> 50:24.484
That's what it is.

50:25.856 --> 50:27.414
Hey, Add?

50:27.457 --> 50:28.651
Yeah?

50:30.527 --> 50:32.654
I scored this for you, son.

50:32.696 --> 50:34.163
Sweet.

50:34.197 --> 50:37.223
Let's thread up some
morning earth and burn.

50:38.468 --> 50:41.266
All right, I'm gonna
go thread it up,

50:41.304 --> 50:43.795
but I gotta pass
on the weed, though.

50:44.808 --> 50:46.673
I'm fasting.

50:46.710 --> 50:47.802
Yeah.

51:01.625 --> 51:04.355
What's so special about surfing?

51:09.833 --> 51:12.859
What's so special about the wind?

51:12.903 --> 51:15.667
Surfing is to...

51:15.705 --> 51:18.401
be with that mystery,

51:18.442 --> 51:22.173
to ride that mystery
for as long as you can.

51:23.780 --> 51:27.614
And when it's over, that's cool,
'cause you know you were there...

51:29.219 --> 51:31.517
in line and on time.

51:38.361 --> 51:43.731
# Why she does #

51:43.767 --> 51:45.826
# What she does... #

51:47.437 --> 51:49.769
- Feel that?
- What?

51:49.806 --> 51:51.273
See that?

51:51.308 --> 51:53.606
No.

51:53.643 --> 51:55.508
They're coming.

51:55.545 --> 51:57.376
They're coming.

51:57.414 --> 51:59.348
Waves are coming.
We're surfing.

51:59.382 --> 52:01.782
We are surfing tomorrow.

52:01.818 --> 52:06.551
Yeah!

52:13.163 --> 52:18.100
# Right now
a ripple would be fine #

52:23.173 --> 52:27.735
# She make me fall
so in love #

52:32.315 --> 52:37.912
# She got me riding
so high #

52:42.192 --> 52:47.220
# Test my patience
just because #

52:50.500 --> 52:55.699
# She knows that she's
the only one #

52:56.806 --> 53:01.072
# That's on my side, yeah #

53:02.212 --> 53:07.172
# Why she does #

53:07.217 --> 53:09.549
# What she does. #

53:30.240 --> 53:31.935
Good morning.

53:34.678 --> 53:36.270
'Morning.

53:41.451 --> 53:42.918
Sorry.

53:48.625 --> 53:50.388
Think we could
head back soon?

53:50.427 --> 53:53.555
I feel bad about Stacey's truck.

54:02.305 --> 54:05.274
Slow, wide turns, brother.

54:23.460 --> 54:27.521
Espero que encuentras lo que buscas.
Later, bro!

54:27.564 --> 54:29.930
We've gone from a low-pressure system

54:29.966 --> 54:32.457
to a no-pressure system
in the Northern Hemisphere.

54:32.502 --> 54:35.801
There is nothing new to report but
a possible record-breaking amount

54:35.839 --> 54:38.239
of days without waves.
Once again, folks,

54:38.275 --> 54:40.243
pray for surf.

54:55.692 --> 54:58.160
Hey, you know how to get
a dude to go surfing?

54:58.194 --> 54:59.684
Not a clue.

54:59.729 --> 55:01.993
You just say, "Dude, it's going off."

55:02.032 --> 55:03.863
It's going off.

55:03.900 --> 55:06.801
You can't forget
the "dude" part.

55:06.836 --> 55:11.205
Lets someone know what kind of dude
is asking them to go surfing.

55:12.409 --> 55:14.172
Dude. Okay.

55:14.210 --> 55:15.507
Got it.

55:17.180 --> 55:18.807
Later, East Coast.

55:48.645 --> 55:50.806
Was he good?

55:54.250 --> 55:56.115
I'm serious.

55:57.787 --> 56:00.153
Then what are you talking about?

56:00.190 --> 56:02.658
Why are you here?

56:02.692 --> 56:05.593
It's Steve Addington.

56:06.596 --> 56:09.622
You've got to get on that again
at least once.

56:09.666 --> 56:11.395
Shut up.

56:11.434 --> 56:13.925
No, seriously,

56:13.970 --> 56:17.963
you gotta keep on hitting that
until the hitting is done.

56:18.007 --> 56:20.669
Whoa, a dustbowl.

56:22.345 --> 56:24.108
Addington?

56:24.147 --> 56:26.206
- Yoo-hoo!
- Yo, Add?

56:26.249 --> 56:29.616
Me, I sweat like a bear in Panama.

56:30.887 --> 56:32.821
What kind of world, right,

56:32.856 --> 56:36.849
that kicks a...
kicks a man out of his house?

56:36.893 --> 56:38.622
Are you cool?

56:38.661 --> 56:41.289
I'm really moved...

56:41.331 --> 56:44.198
you dudes came over.

56:44.234 --> 56:47.499
Love and waves...

56:47.537 --> 56:50.028
that's what we need
in these dark days, man,

56:50.073 --> 56:51.563
is love...

56:54.210 --> 56:55.905
and waves.

56:56.913 --> 56:59.108
And some hairy buds, bro.

57:00.116 --> 57:02.346
And some hairy bud, man.

57:06.256 --> 57:08.520
Uh, cops behind us.

57:08.558 --> 57:11.391
- Be cool, man.
- Be cool.

57:11.428 --> 57:13.123
Be cool, be cool, be cool.

57:13.163 --> 57:14.391
Be cool, be cool, be cool.

57:26.709 --> 57:28.540
Be cool.

57:28.578 --> 57:31.274
Fuck!
Uh... uh, I'm pulling over.

57:31.314 --> 57:32.872
- Somebody bail with the weed.
- Hey!

57:34.517 --> 57:36.883
Too fast... too fast, dude.
Too fast, too fast.

57:40.924 --> 57:43.017
- They'll deport me.
- Dude.

57:43.059 --> 57:44.822
On three, we scatter.

57:44.861 --> 57:47.352
One, two, three!

58:04.380 --> 58:06.439
Ahh.

58:06.483 --> 58:09.919
Hey, litterbug, found your marijuana.

58:09.953 --> 58:11.648
Is it yours?

58:13.022 --> 58:15.013
Technically, no.

58:16.326 --> 58:17.850
Freeze, hippie!

58:17.894 --> 58:20.419
- Don't you lie to us.
- All right, all right, man.

58:20.463 --> 58:22.988
You're right.
It is mine.

58:23.032 --> 58:25.125
I was holding it.

58:25.168 --> 58:28.365
I tossed it.
Yeah, it's mine.

58:28.404 --> 58:30.463
Aren't you Steve Addington?

58:30.507 --> 58:32.441
- What?
- That famous surfer?

58:32.475 --> 58:33.533
Yeah.

58:33.576 --> 58:35.806
You suck, bitch!

58:37.547 --> 58:40.880
That's right, mamao!
It's Lupe!

58:40.917 --> 58:42.714
I pimped you, bitch!

58:42.752 --> 58:44.686
Someone tell me what the fuck
is going on.

58:44.721 --> 58:46.416
Come on, bro, I need you to
pick it up a little bit here.

58:46.456 --> 58:48.083
All right? We're gonna
make some money with this shit.

58:48.124 --> 58:50.092
Call me a "beaner" or something.
Liven up, dude. Come on.

58:54.631 --> 58:56.531
You dudes are in on this?

58:56.566 --> 58:58.932
- Waves, man.
- Nothing but waves.

58:58.968 --> 59:01.334
- In a game, man.
- Free Surfer, dude.

59:01.371 --> 59:03.236
All the time, all day.

59:03.273 --> 59:05.605
Man, it's some kind
of digital alchemy.

59:05.642 --> 59:07.974
Yeah yeah yeah! Barrels of love, baby.

59:08.011 --> 59:11.344
- Where you wanna go, man?
- Aw, dudes.

59:11.381 --> 59:14.111
It is Lupe time!

59:14.150 --> 59:16.118
Where you going, papi?

59:16.152 --> 59:18.916
It's okay...
grass grows, birds fly

59:18.955 --> 59:20.946
and Addington runs from my beauty.

59:20.990 --> 59:23.584
It's okay. It's an easy thing to
run from 'cause I'm so gorgeous!

59:44.147 --> 59:48.641
A little rain, storm clouds, low front...
you know, perfect.

59:48.685 --> 59:50.949
So it's a great
business opportunity,

59:50.987 --> 59:53.421
but the guy's a real
wheeler-dealer, right?

59:53.456 --> 59:56.516
Yes, he's a scumbag,
but his business model is strong.

59:56.559 --> 59:58.424
He's perfectly positioned, really.

01:00:00.763 --> 01:00:03.789
Oh, Addington, Addington...

01:00:05.468 --> 01:00:08.232
- Are you shitting me?
- Yes, he says he wants to talk.

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:10.535
- He's at the main gate now.
- Ha!

01:00:10.573 --> 01:00:12.598
All right, all right.
Get the contracts ready.

01:00:12.642 --> 01:00:15.236
- Get the cameras ready too.
- Okay.

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:16.905
Yes!

01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:18.675
Addington... I love this guy.

01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:25.516
Okay, we're gonna need you to
sign here, here and here.

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:33.356
And I do this, you...

01:00:33.396 --> 01:00:35.421
turn it all back on, right?

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:38.866
I mean, the travel card,
the checks?

01:00:38.901 --> 01:00:41.131
You live in my house
for the last two weeks,

01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:43.138
you let me digitize you
for Free Surfer, dude,

01:00:43.172 --> 01:00:46.039
I will put you back on
your throne of cool.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:53.449
Pick a break,
anywhere in the world,

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:55.314
you're on a plane
the day we wrap.

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:57.444
What about my brothers?
They come too?

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:59.045
On the house.

01:00:59.088 --> 01:01:01.147
How about Jack?

01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:03.886
I'm not signing shit
until I know he's out.

01:01:03.926 --> 01:01:06.656
Good. He just left processing...
all the charges have been dropped.

01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:13.494
- Jacko?
- Hey, Add.

01:01:13.536 --> 01:01:15.060
Man, you free?

01:01:15.104 --> 01:01:18.596
Ha ha, yeah, bro!
I'm free. Thank you.

01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:21.940
I don't know what you did,
but, boom... they let me out.

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:24.503
I'm gonna sign
these contracts, Jack.

01:01:24.547 --> 01:01:27.983
Dude... dude, don't sign anything.

01:01:28.017 --> 01:01:31.453
Don't sign...
I would rather go back to jail, Add.

01:01:31.487 --> 01:01:35.218
If I beg you on my knees... I'm not
on my knees 'cause it's concrete, dude,

01:01:35.258 --> 01:01:38.125
but do not... do not sign
those contract...

01:01:39.262 --> 01:01:41.594
Add? Add?

01:01:46.436 --> 01:01:48.495
You're doing the right thing,
my friend.

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:50.267
Mm-hmm.

01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:56.639
Yeah.

01:01:56.679 --> 01:01:58.271
Let's do it, man.

01:02:03.419 --> 01:02:05.148
Come in.

01:02:35.118 --> 01:02:36.676
Danni?

01:03:18.728 --> 01:03:20.923
Okay, Mr. Addington,

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:23.329
you have a favorite break?
Any break in the world.

01:03:23.366 --> 01:03:25.732
Oh, yeah.

01:03:25.768 --> 01:03:27.759
Uh, and what is it?

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:31.001
I'm not telling you, dude.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.337
Oh.

01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:33.808
Okay.

01:03:33.843 --> 01:03:35.777
I'll just pick one.

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:39.077
So act naturally

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:42.278
and if you feel any nausea,
dizziness or pain in the chest,

01:03:42.318 --> 01:03:43.717
let us know.

01:03:43.753 --> 01:03:45.152
Here we go.

01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:04.897
# Whooo! #

01:04:04.941 --> 01:04:06.465
He sees it. You ready?

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:12.938
Come on, pop it, man.

01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:15.712
# Whoo! #

01:04:15.751 --> 01:04:18.379
Come on. Come on.

01:04:22.225 --> 01:04:24.523
What the fuck is he doing?

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.926
- # Whooo! #
- Addington?

01:04:28.731 --> 01:04:31.894
No no, Addington...

01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:33.595
What...

01:04:33.636 --> 01:04:35.228
Addington?

01:04:36.839 --> 01:04:39.034
God damn it.

01:04:39.075 --> 01:04:41.270
Addington!

01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:43.870
God damn it!

01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:47.182
- Fuck.
- Ahhh!

01:04:55.258 --> 01:04:57.453
He fucking bailed.

01:04:59.228 --> 01:05:01.389
# Whooo! #

01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:02.863
No no no no!
Where is he going?

01:05:05.167 --> 01:05:06.930
God damn it!

01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:13.402
Come on, get a camera.
Find his fucking ass now.

01:05:14.944 --> 01:05:16.775
# Whooo! #

01:06:22.411 --> 01:06:24.504
Farmer Bob?

01:06:43.332 --> 01:06:45.129
How many are there?

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:47.226
300 or more.

01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:49.863
You wanted them roaming free,
so there they are...

01:06:49.905 --> 01:06:51.532
roaming free.

01:06:56.345 --> 01:06:58.836
Dude...

01:06:58.881 --> 01:07:02.282
- who mows your grass?
- Hmm?

01:07:03.285 --> 01:07:04.650
They do.

01:07:19.802 --> 01:07:22.464
At ease, at ease.
Carry on.

01:07:23.472 --> 01:07:26.873
So where's Addington, huh?

01:07:27.877 --> 01:07:31.210
Besides his nuts, I mean,
which I got right here.

01:07:31.247 --> 01:07:33.442
Mr. Simons is here...

01:07:33.482 --> 01:07:35.677
with another gentleman.

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:38.050
- Mr. Sim...
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:38.087 --> 01:07:39.748
Wait.

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:42.952
- New York Simons?
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:42.992 --> 01:07:45.017
- He's here?
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:48.697 --> 01:07:50.790
We were as surprised
as anybody,

01:07:50.833 --> 01:07:53.324
but Mr. Martin made the offer
and they jumped at it.

01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:55.997
- Happened just like that.
- All... all right.

01:07:56.038 --> 01:07:58.199
Well, what happens now?

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:01.641
Your company falls under
Mercer's DSK Enterprises.

01:08:01.677 --> 01:08:04.612
Yeah, this is good.
This is very good.

01:08:04.647 --> 01:08:07.411
Growth is good. You got
the muscle to move some product here.

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:09.509
That's what
I've been talking about. Huh?

01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:11.782
What do you know about
the surfing industry, Mr. Martin?

01:08:11.821 --> 01:08:14.483
- Not much. Nn-nnh.
- Nnn?

01:08:14.523 --> 01:08:17.549
Tell me about Steve Addington.

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:20.921
Steve Addington?

01:08:20.962 --> 01:08:23.830
Well, he's a big-name surfer.
Little difficult to work with,

01:08:23.866 --> 01:08:27.267
but I own...
well, we own his image

01:08:27.303 --> 01:08:28.930
and image is reality,
so we own his reality.

01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:30.529
Just gotta squeeze it
a bit harder, that's all.

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:35.100
From what I hear,
Mr. Addington is surfing.

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:38.841
And more importantly,
he's cool and cool sells.

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:42.680
And when you defame and
slander Mr. Cool,

01:08:43.685 --> 01:08:45.620
well, that's bad for business.

01:08:48.057 --> 01:08:51.082
I don't... I don't...
I agree, I guess.

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:53.857
Of course I do, but, um...

01:08:53.895 --> 01:08:56.865
I would dispute that we...

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:59.493
I would dispute... I would dispute
that it came from us.

01:09:01.337 --> 01:09:04.067
Eddie, how about
you show us around?

01:09:05.241 --> 01:09:07.232
Yes, please.

01:09:07.276 --> 01:09:09.971
And why don't we start
at the front door?

01:09:10.011 --> 01:09:12.173
Okay, sure.

01:09:12.214 --> 01:09:14.648
Yeah, fine, let's...

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:18.880
I'm a surfer, dude.

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:23.517
Video games, reality TV,
Free Surfer...

01:09:23.559 --> 01:09:26.493
I mean, what the fuck
is that, man?

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:32.831
I'm not some ass-clown in a green room.
I'm a surfer, dude.

01:09:32.868 --> 01:09:34.267
Yes.

01:09:34.303 --> 01:09:36.328
Look at it this way, Eddie.

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:39.773
You have been relieved,
but with all this free time,

01:09:39.808 --> 01:09:42.504
maybe you can pick up
surfing again.

01:09:42.545 --> 01:09:46.481
Oh, and you've met
my daughter Danni.

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:49.279
Your...

01:09:49.318 --> 01:09:51.513
Wait, that was...

01:09:51.554 --> 01:09:53.249
Oh my God.

01:09:53.288 --> 01:09:55.553
Ah, that's so...

01:09:55.591 --> 01:09:57.286
You can go now.

01:09:58.294 --> 01:10:02.196
Security will show you out.

01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:03.858
You know what?

01:10:03.899 --> 01:10:07.357
All of you... you can all
just take a flying fuck.

01:10:12.675 --> 01:10:15.735
- I'm a surfer, dude.
- Good girl.

01:10:15.778 --> 01:10:18.747
# Come, my brother, come slowly #

01:10:18.781 --> 01:10:21.375
# Come easy, my friend #

01:10:21.417 --> 01:10:23.180
# Come, my friend #

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:24.520
# Come, my sister #

01:10:24.954 --> 01:10:27.286
# Come easy,
come busy... #

01:10:27.323 --> 01:10:28.381
He's here.

01:10:28.424 --> 01:10:30.289
Oh!

01:10:30.326 --> 01:10:32.851
The worm has turned, bro.

01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:36.797
# Take your heart out, let go,
come let go #

01:10:36.832 --> 01:10:39.596
# Come, my sister,
can I hold you... #

01:10:39.635 --> 01:10:41.466
Goats?

01:10:41.503 --> 01:10:43.937
Those are your new mowers, bro.

01:10:45.507 --> 01:10:48.442
No, bro...

01:10:48.477 --> 01:10:51.412
I think I need more than two.

01:10:51.447 --> 01:10:54.905
Well, more than two,
you got, brother.

01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:58.579
They cut, they fertilize,
they cut, they fertilize,

01:10:58.621 --> 01:11:01.522
- they cut and...
- And they fertilize.

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:04.620
# Come let go #

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:13.928
- # Come the winter, come summer... #
- Addington!

01:11:13.969 --> 01:11:18.201
# Come autumn, come spring,
do your thing... #

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.674
That clip was bullshit, man.

01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:24.139
I threw a breakfast burrito
at you, bro.

01:11:24.179 --> 01:11:26.409
Sorry, dude.

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:30.648
- It's cool.
- Right on, man.

01:11:36.158 --> 01:11:38.558
# Whooo! #

01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:42.823
Waves, bro!

01:11:42.865 --> 01:11:45.163
- # Whooo! #
- Waves?

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.292
- Waves.
- Waves.

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:52.264
# Whooo! #

01:11:55.577 --> 01:11:58.205
# Hey! #

01:12:03.485 --> 01:12:05.715
# Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo #

01:12:05.754 --> 01:12:08.587
# Come, my brother,
put your hands up #

01:12:08.624 --> 01:12:11.525
# Take your heart out,
let go #

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:12.822
# Come let go #

01:12:12.861 --> 01:12:15.421
# Come, my sister, can I hold you? #

01:12:15.464 --> 01:12:17.159
# Can I squeeze you? #

01:12:17.199 --> 01:12:19.759
# Let go, come let go... #

01:12:23.372 --> 01:12:26.205
These contracts,
they're not binding,

01:12:26.241 --> 01:12:27.674
but my offer still stands.

01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:30.144
I say, I dig your vibe,
Mr. Martin, I do,

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:32.204
and I appreciate your offer.

01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:35.910
But me and Jack over there... we let him
handle all the business deals.

01:12:35.951 --> 01:12:37.043
Understood.

01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:40.817
I gotta tell you, though,
bro to bro...

01:12:40.856 --> 01:12:42.847
if it wasn't for this chick...

01:12:42.891 --> 01:12:44.950
- What? A girl?
- Oh, yeah.

01:12:44.993 --> 01:12:48.429
Yeah, charged and peaceful
all at the same time,

01:12:48.464 --> 01:12:50.557
- kind of like the ocean.
- Ha.

01:12:51.567 --> 01:12:54.195
Speaking of, there she is right now,

01:12:54.236 --> 01:12:55.703
on time.

01:12:55.738 --> 01:12:57.672
Ah...

01:12:57.706 --> 01:13:01.107
That's...
that's my daughter, Steve.

01:13:02.144 --> 01:13:03.941
- She's your daughter?
- Mm-hmm.

01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:07.307
Dude,

01:13:07.349 --> 01:13:08.873
you're stoked.

01:13:09.918 --> 01:13:11.783
It's going off, dude.

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:15.051
- Later, dude.
- Yeah.

01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:16.387
Yeah.

01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:29.301
Oh, boy.

01:13:33.275 --> 01:13:36.472
- Mr. Mayweather?
- Oh, Mr. Martin.

01:13:36.512 --> 01:13:39.276
I've been going over
these contracts

01:13:39.314 --> 01:13:41.578
and... who are Ben and Barry?

01:13:41.617 --> 01:13:45.383
Well, step into my office.
Let's have a little conversation.

01:13:50.192 --> 01:13:52.956
# Whooo! #

01:13:57.433 --> 01:13:59.867
# Whooo! #

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.965
# Whooo! #

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:21.988
# Can you feel it?
It's coming up again #

01:14:22.024 --> 01:14:25.755
# And I can feel it
coming up again #

01:14:25.794 --> 01:14:29.025
# I can feel it
coming through the wind #

01:14:29.064 --> 01:14:31.897
# Can you feel it?
She get me smilin' again #

01:14:31.934 --> 01:14:35.335
# Can you feel it
coming up again? #

01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:38.498
# I can feel it,
she givin' up again #

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:41.737
# Can you feel it
coming through the wind? #

01:14:41.777 --> 01:14:45.440
# I can feel it,
she get me smilin' again #

01:14:46.648 --> 01:14:48.445
# Oh ooh #

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:53.478
# Oh, she get me
smilin' again #

01:14:55.657 --> 01:14:56.851
# Whooo! #

01:14:56.892 --> 01:15:00.623
# Say, can you feel it,
she comin' up again? #

01:15:00.662 --> 01:15:03.927
# I can feel it
coming through the wind #

01:15:03.966 --> 01:15:07.197
# Can you feel it?
She givin' up again #

01:15:07.236 --> 01:15:11.002
# I can feel it,
she came in strong again #

01:15:12.007 --> 01:15:14.066
# I can feel it #

01:15:15.077 --> 01:15:16.874
# I can feel it #

01:15:18.146 --> 01:15:20.910
# I can feel it, ehhh #

01:15:22.584 --> 01:15:24.415
# Waiting #

01:15:24.453 --> 01:15:27.945
# So long, it seems,
that I've been waiting #

01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:31.424
# Whoo! #

01:15:34.129 --> 01:15:36.893
# So long, it seems #

01:15:40.002 --> 01:15:43.335
# So long, it seems,
that I've been waiting #

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:47.535
# Whoo! #

01:15:47.576 --> 01:15:49.237
# Hey #

01:15:57.753 --> 01:16:00.449
# Can you feel it? #

01:16:02.624 --> 01:16:03.352
# Can you feel it? #

01:16:06.295 --> 01:16:08.855
Ah, barrel.

01:16:12.234 --> 01:16:14.168
What's the barrel?

01:16:21.877 --> 01:16:25.313
There's nothing we can do for him, Chip.
The transplant didn't take.

01:16:25.347 --> 01:16:28.180
We're lifeguards, not lawyers.

01:16:28.216 --> 01:16:29.581
That was good.

01:16:29.618 --> 01:16:32.314
Okay. Ay gy gy gy gy gy gy...

01:16:32.354 --> 01:16:35.414
La Rosa... you want to see
my beautiful face.

01:16:35.457 --> 01:16:36.549
Ah ka ka ka ka!

01:16:41.496 --> 01:16:44.727
Okay. Hello, is anybody there?

01:16:44.766 --> 01:16:46.666
What is this shit?

01:16:46.702 --> 01:16:50.069
# Fuk it #

01:16:51.139 --> 01:16:53.266
# Fuk it #

01:16:53.308 --> 01:16:56.539
# It's all good again, my friends #

01:16:56.578 --> 01:16:59.513
# My friends, my friends... #

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:01.140
You wanna get high?

01:17:01.183 --> 01:17:04.016
Oh, yeah, bro.
I'm right behind you.

01:17:04.052 --> 01:17:07.681
I just got a little business
to take care of.

01:17:07.723 --> 01:17:11.420
# Waiting #

01:17:13.562 --> 01:17:15.826
# Ha! Can you feel it? #

01:17:15.864 --> 01:17:17.695
# She's coming up again #

01:17:17.733 --> 01:17:20.725
# I can feel it
coming through the wind... #

01:17:20.769 --> 01:17:22.566
Ah ha ha ha ha.

01:17:22.604 --> 01:17:24.469
# Koo koo koo koo koo. #

01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:32.774
# Whoo hoo hoo #

01:17:34.816 --> 01:17:39.446
# Yeah yeah yeah yeah #

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:42.980
# Heard you saying
it won't make a difference #

01:17:43.025 --> 01:17:47.621
# It's only you and
it's just this once, yeah #

01:17:47.663 --> 01:17:50.996
# It's only this time #

01:17:51.033 --> 01:17:54.491
# Don't you think that
it all adds up? #

01:17:54.536 --> 01:17:58.529
# There's a reaction
for each action, man #

01:17:58.573 --> 01:18:02.942
# And where do you
draw the line? #

01:18:02.978 --> 01:18:06.641
# Know thyself and
to thine own self be true #

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:10.516
# Any other way is
gonna make you feel blue #

01:18:10.552 --> 01:18:14.613
# Yeah, you got
a reason to be #

01:18:14.656 --> 01:18:18.820
# Maybe if we focus and
we get it together #

01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:22.762
# We could raise the human
consciousness and make things better #

01:18:22.798 --> 01:18:26.757
# Yeah, I know you think
I'm a dreamer #

01:18:26.802 --> 01:18:33.765
# But I know that you're also
seeking peace of mind #

01:18:35.277 --> 01:18:38.542
# Wonder why
you feel so tired #

01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:41.981
# Why your third eye's blind #

01:18:43.118 --> 01:18:46.713
# And I know that
you're also trying #

01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:50.851
# To find your place #

01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:53.360
# You're somewhere all the time #

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:58.856
# And somewhere out in space #

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:02.996
# Get so exhausted
for money exhausts #

01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:06.667
# Living in fear from
living in a box #

01:19:06.708 --> 01:19:10.610
# Yeah, how come we
always have to try? #

01:19:10.645 --> 01:19:14.775
# I keep wishing corporations
and the politicians #

01:19:14.816 --> 01:19:18.946
# Would make tighter restrictions
on the fossil-fuel emissions #

01:19:18.987 --> 01:19:22.184
# And meanwhile,
why don't we walk? #

01:19:22.224 --> 01:19:26.957
# If we all did a little
then a lot would be done #

01:19:26.995 --> 01:19:30.761
# Clean up the mess
and try to have some fun #

01:19:30.799 --> 01:19:34.530
# Yeah, I'm off to
plant a tree now #

01:19:34.569 --> 01:19:38.733
# 'Cause if everybody takes
and nobody gives #

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:42.870
# There'll soon be nowhere to breathe,
nowhere to live #

01:19:42.911 --> 01:19:46.403
# But you can't stop
Mother Nature #

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:51.215
# But I know that
you're also seeking #

01:19:51.253 --> 01:19:54.279
# Peace of mind #

01:19:55.290 --> 01:19:58.657
# Wondering why
you feel so tired #

01:19:58.693 --> 01:20:02.288
# Why your third eye's blind #

01:20:03.298 --> 01:20:06.961
# I know that you're
also trying #

01:20:07.002 --> 01:20:10.938
# To find your place #

01:20:10.972 --> 01:20:13.497
# You're somewhere all the time #

01:20:13.542 --> 01:20:18.241
# And somewhere out in space #

01:20:19.247 --> 01:20:23.081
# Did you remember to
give thanks for the food #

01:20:23.118 --> 01:20:26.952
# The earth and the water
and everything good? Yeah #

01:20:28.089 --> 01:20:31.149
# The fire's still burning #

01:20:31.193 --> 01:20:35.061
# Talk to yourself 'cause
no one knows you better #

01:20:35.096 --> 01:20:38.827
# Even take the time
to write yourself a letter #

01:20:39.835 --> 01:20:42.497
# Don't you know
the wheels are still turning? #

01:20:42.537 --> 01:20:46.940
# There's no better time than now
to stand up straight #

01:20:46.975 --> 01:20:50.638
# Take a deep breath,
Lord, it's never too late #

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:54.672
# To expell your confusion #

01:20:54.716 --> 01:20:58.948
# Say it's all been done
and there's no sense trying #

01:20:58.987 --> 01:21:03.083
# They don't really know you
and they're probably lying #

01:21:03.124 --> 01:21:06.491
# You've got to see
for yourself, yeah #

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:10.897
# But I know that
you're also seeking #

01:21:10.932 --> 01:21:14.459
# Peace of mind #

01:21:14.502 --> 01:21:18.768
# Wondering why
you feel so tired #

01:21:18.807 --> 01:21:22.106
# Why your third eye's blind #

01:21:23.178 --> 01:21:26.636
# And I know that you're
also trying #

01:21:26.681 --> 01:21:30.344
# To find your place #

01:21:30.385 --> 01:21:33.411
# You're somewhere all the time #

01:21:33.455 --> 01:21:38.154
# And somewhere out in space #

01:21:38.193 --> 01:21:43.028
# I know that
you're also seeking #

01:21:47.335 --> 01:21:51.101
# I know that you're
also out there #

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:59.707
# Oh, yeah
oh, yeah #

01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:03.445
# Oh, yeah-eah #

01:22:03.485 --> 01:22:07.319
# Oh, yeah, oh, yeah #

01:22:07.355 --> 01:22:10.483
# Oh, yeah-eah #

01:22:11.493 --> 01:22:15.657
# I know that you're
also seeking #

01:22:19.334 --> 01:22:23.134
# I know that you're also
out there #

01:22:27.242 --> 01:22:31.303
# Oh, yeah, oh, yeah #

01:22:31.346 --> 01:22:35.077
# Oh, yeah-eah-eah #

01:22:35.116 --> 01:22:36.811
# Uh-huh #

01:22:36.851 --> 01:22:38.819
# Uh-huuh #

01:22:38.853 --> 01:22:42.755
# Uh-huuuuh. #

01:22:47.529 --> 01:22:50.987
Yes yes.
And that is why we want him to...

01:22:51.032 --> 01:22:53.762
represent our board.

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:56.532
Of course. Well, that's what
he's doing here, of course.

01:22:56.571 --> 01:22:57.833
- Yes yes.
- And you know what?

01:22:57.872 --> 01:23:00.466
Maybe we'll all go to dinner after
or something, maybe.

01:23:00.508 --> 01:23:02.772
- Korean barbeque.
- Ah, Korean barbeque.

01:23:02.811 --> 01:23:06.144
That's what I was thinking.
Okay, we'll get him in the water...

01:23:06.181 --> 01:23:08.809
Okay, it's time for you
to do your thing.

01:23:08.850 --> 01:23:11.216
Things are looking
good over here.

01:23:11.252 --> 01:23:14.915
I thought you said it was
made by some soulful dudes.

01:23:14.956 --> 01:23:18.722
No no no, I said
"dudes from Seoul," bro.

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:21.490
Yeah. It's a hacked bomber, man.

01:23:21.529 --> 01:23:23.895
It's got a bee on it, man.

01:23:23.932 --> 01:23:25.524
You know?

01:23:25.567 --> 01:23:28.195
Nine skegs.

01:23:28.236 --> 01:23:32.400
Look, bro, do me a favor... get on that
damn thing and ride it, all right?

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:34.874
We're one wave away
from a payday

01:23:34.909 --> 01:23:37.139
and, like,
we're check-light, okay?

01:23:37.178 --> 01:23:39.646
We need some checks
coming in.

01:23:39.681 --> 01:23:41.979
Yeah?

01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:44.577
Party. Get stoned!

01:23:44.619 --> 01:23:45.916
Respect.

01:23:45.954 --> 01:23:48.422
Ha! Respect.

01:23:48.456 --> 01:23:49.684
Yeah.

01:23:49.724 --> 01:23:50.782
Ha ha!

01:23:50.825 --> 01:23:53.316
Yeah, respect.
Re... respect.

01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:56.023
Okay, ladies, he doesn't
go in for that.

01:23:56.064 --> 01:23:57.656
I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm cool.

01:23:59.901 --> 01:24:01.300
All right.

01:24:01.336 --> 01:24:03.634
All right. Ahh.

01:24:38.406 --> 01:24:41.898
Dude, outside!

01:24:42.977 --> 01:24:45.138
Outside!

01:24:57.659 --> 01:24:59.251
What happened?

01:24:59.294 --> 01:25:02.491
Addington's supposed to be good.
Addington sucks.

01:25:02.530 --> 01:25:04.498
Mr. Addington's all big talk.

01:25:04.532 --> 01:25:07.660
Look at my man over here.

01:25:09.537 --> 01:25:11.937
He go out there and he break it.

01:25:11.973 --> 01:25:13.907
It's broken!
It is our only board.

01:25:13.942 --> 01:25:17.503
