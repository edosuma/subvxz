00:25.442 --> 00:27.527
Archer to the bridge.

00:27.736 --> 00:29.654
Lieutenant Reed, sir.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.448
What the hell's going on?

00:31.698 --> 00:34.826
We are having a little trouble
with the gravity plating on E Deck.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.037
I hope it hasn't caused you
any inconvenience.

00:37.245 --> 00:39.789
Oh, no, no, no. Not at all.

00:39.998 --> 00:42.083
Any idea when you might
get it back online?

00:42.334 --> 00:44.502
Commander Tucker says
it should be any minute now, sir.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.718
Thank you.

00:54.679 --> 01:00.018
"It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here"

01:02.479 --> 01:05.899
"It's been a long time"

01:06.107 --> 01:09.944
"But my time is finally near"

01:10.153 --> 01:14.407
"And I will see my dream
Come alive at last"

01:14.616 --> 01:17.535
"I will touch the sky"

01:17.744 --> 01:21.539
"And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more"

01:21.748 --> 01:24.751
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"

01:24.959 --> 01:29.672
"'Cause I've got faith of the heart"

01:29.881 --> 01:32.800
"I'm going where my heart will take me"

01:33.009 --> 01:37.597
"I've got faith to believe"

01:37.805 --> 01:40.391
"I can do anything"

01:40.600 --> 01:45.104
"I've got strength of the soul"

01:45.313 --> 01:48.191
"And no one's gonna bend or break me"

01:48.399 --> 01:53.738
"I can reach any star"

01:54.113 --> 01:57.867
"I've got faith"

01:58.075 --> 02:01.787
"I've got faith"

02:01.996 --> 02:06.792
"Faith of the heart"

02:21.891 --> 02:23.601
Not a very adventurous breakfast.

02:24.101 --> 02:26.645
Plomeek broth is a traditional
morning meal on Vulcan.

02:27.146 --> 02:31.400
But you're not on Vulcan. You
should try these blueberry pancakes.

02:31.609 --> 02:32.860
They're quite delicious.

02:33.068 --> 02:35.654
I sampled human food
on several occasions.

02:35.863 --> 02:38.574
- It didn't agree with me.
- Give it some time.

02:38.782 --> 02:41.452
The Vulcan digestive tract
is highly adaptable.

02:41.660 --> 02:44.288
I prefer to eat the foods
I'm accustomed to.

02:45.289 --> 02:46.498
There's an old saying:

02:46.707 --> 02:50.711
"When in Fellebia,
do as the Fellebians do."

02:50.919 --> 02:53.255
It's difficult enough
having to smell all this.

02:53.464 --> 02:56.508
Eating it is out of the question.

03:00.512 --> 03:04.057
- Water, carbonated.
- Now, that's adventurous.

03:15.652 --> 03:18.405
We're getting reports from C Deck
that it's down to 12 degrees.

03:18.613 --> 03:21.700
- Ensign Almack is working on it.
- Well, tell him to hurry up.

03:21.908 --> 03:25.704
If the relays up there get too cold,
they're gonna start cutting out on us.

03:27.122 --> 03:28.373
Engineering.

03:28.582 --> 03:31.543
We've got a power fluctuation
in the starboard nacelle, sir.

03:31.752 --> 03:34.963
- We'll get to it as soon as we can.
- Aye, sir.

03:39.885 --> 03:41.261
Any luck?

03:41.469 --> 03:44.472
We know it's got something to do
with the plasma exhaust.

03:44.681 --> 03:46.391
The flow's been restricted
for some reason,

03:46.600 --> 03:49.394
and it's screwing up half the systems
on the ship.

03:49.936 --> 03:52.480
- Tell Billy to purge the aft manifold.
- Sir.

03:52.689 --> 03:55.817
You think it might be a good idea
to drop out of warp?

03:56.067 --> 03:58.653
Give me a minute, sir.
I think we can figure it out.

04:12.792 --> 04:14.544
Tucker to bridge.

04:14.752 --> 04:17.463
Might be a good idea
to drop out of warp.

04:18.089 --> 04:19.548
Going to impulse, sir.

04:19.757 --> 04:23.303
Commander, I think
I've found the problem.

04:24.554 --> 04:26.097
Something's distorting
our wake pattern.

04:26.306 --> 04:27.974
You're right. The plasma exhaust

04:28.182 --> 04:30.101
shouldn't be flaring that close
to the ship.

04:30.310 --> 04:34.522
- EM residue in the exhaust ports?
- No, we checked. They're clean.

04:35.481 --> 04:38.276
Malcolm, if we ignited
the plasma exhaust,

04:38.484 --> 04:40.945
what kind of damage would it do
to the nacelles?

04:41.154 --> 04:43.614
- Sir?
- How much damage?

04:43.823 --> 04:46.075
If we polarize the hull plating,
it should be all right.

04:46.284 --> 04:48.870
As long as we maintained
at least half impulse.

04:49.078 --> 04:51.747
- Go to half impulse, ensign.
- Aye, sir.

04:51.998 --> 04:54.083
Put up A-four.

04:56.878 --> 05:00.423
- Record all aft sensors.
- Hull plating?

05:00.882 --> 05:02.466
Both nacelles are on maximum.

05:02.675 --> 05:06.637
Stand by to ignite a charge
at 80 metres due aft.

05:07.722 --> 05:09.265
Fire.

05:13.602 --> 05:15.229
Play it back...

05:15.438 --> 05:16.731
...slowly.

05:20.443 --> 05:23.279
Go back and freeze it at the flashpoint.

05:25.698 --> 05:27.950
Creep it forward a little.

05:28.617 --> 05:30.077
There.

05:30.828 --> 05:32.997
Looks like we've got ourselves
a hitchhiker.

05:33.205 --> 05:36.250
They must be using some sort
of stealth technology.

05:36.542 --> 05:38.085
I wonder how long they've been there.

05:38.335 --> 05:41.422
Long enough to throw half
our systems out of whack.

05:42.089 --> 05:45.384
I'm sure they know we've detected
them. Open hailing frequencies.

05:46.343 --> 05:48.345
Our ship-to-ship sensors
are malfunctioning.

05:48.554 --> 05:49.972
I can only give you audio.

05:50.973 --> 05:52.391
Translator's active.

05:52.641 --> 05:56.395
This is Captain Jonathan Archer
of the starship Enterprise.

05:56.603 --> 05:59.231
I don't need to tell you where we are.

05:59.440 --> 06:02.359
Your presence is disrupting
a number of our systems.

06:02.568 --> 06:06.613
Please back away to a distance
of at least 10 kilometres and respond.

06:15.114 --> 06:16.915
Harm us.

06:18.208 --> 06:21.837
Your request.
We ask you not to harm us.

06:22.045 --> 06:23.880
We are complying with your request.

06:24.089 --> 06:26.967
- We ask you not to harm us.
- They're moving off, sir.

06:27.426 --> 06:31.638
We have no intention of harming you,
but I wouldn't mind an explanation.

06:31.847 --> 06:34.516
I apologize for any damage
we've caused.

06:34.725 --> 06:36.184
Our engines are malfunctioning,

06:36.393 --> 06:38.186
and we've been using
your plasma exhaust

06:38.395 --> 06:40.939
to replenish our teraphasic coils.

06:41.148 --> 06:43.024
It's allowed us to share
your warp field.

06:43.483 --> 06:45.735
Their warp reactor is off-line.

06:46.945 --> 06:49.447
We can't help you
unless we can see you.

06:49.656 --> 06:53.535
So why don't you disconnect
whatever stealth device you're using.

06:57.872 --> 07:02.002
I'm giving you 40 milligrams
of mirazine.

07:02.210 --> 07:05.505
It should shorten
the decompression process by half.

07:05.714 --> 07:09.008
That still leaves three hours.
Can you recommend a good book?

07:09.217 --> 07:11.636
I'll be briefing you
on their propulsion systems.

07:12.470 --> 07:14.431
Sure you don't want me
coming back at night?

07:14.639 --> 07:16.558
Three hours of decompression
in each direction,

07:16.766 --> 07:18.643
makes more sense to stay
until the job's done.

07:18.852 --> 07:20.478
I've sent them
your dietary requirements.

07:20.687 --> 07:24.274
They claim to have the ability to
synthesize protein and carbohydrates,

07:24.482 --> 07:26.484
but there's no telling
what it may taste like.

07:26.693 --> 07:29.320
Try to be diplomatic.

07:30.363 --> 07:33.074
Three days on an alien ship.

07:33.449 --> 07:35.827
Remember to mind your manners.

07:49.006 --> 07:52.260
- We've got a seal.
- Just about ready.

07:52.468 --> 07:54.720
It's too bad the ship-to-ship sensors
are down.

07:54.929 --> 07:56.597
Would have been nice
to get a look at them.

07:56.806 --> 07:58.599
I'll just think of it as a blind date.

08:01.561 --> 08:04.063
- Tucker to Enterprise.
- Archer.

08:04.272 --> 08:05.356
Here I go, sir.

08:05.565 --> 08:08.609
Keep your com channel open.
We'll be right here.

08:23.249 --> 08:24.875
Here you go.

08:32.174 --> 08:36.761
- Don't forget to come back for me.
- I don't know. We are kind of busy.

08:42.559 --> 08:44.353
Have fun.

08:59.201 --> 09:00.828
Hello?

09:11.505 --> 09:13.298
Hello?

09:16.718 --> 09:20.430
Try to maintain your normal rate
of respiration.

09:21.807 --> 09:23.308
This stuff's burning my lungs.

09:23.517 --> 09:26.270
Maintain your normal rate
of respiration.

09:26.478 --> 09:29.189
The discomfort will subside.

09:38.448 --> 09:42.828
Commander Tucker's calling
again, sir. He's rather anxious.

09:43.120 --> 09:46.957
- Put him through.
- How long's it been, sir?

09:47.165 --> 09:49.543
About five minutes longer than
the last time you asked.

09:49.793 --> 09:52.337
- How's the breathing?
- A lot easier,

09:52.546 --> 09:54.297
but I prefer air I can't see.

09:54.548 --> 09:56.258
They told us the air would clear up

09:56.466 --> 09:58.760
during the last half-hour
of decompression.

09:59.010 --> 10:01.346
I feel like I've been in here
for a week.

10:01.554 --> 10:05.475
You've only got 45 minutes
to go, Trip. Be patient.

10:06.768 --> 10:08.311
Hey.

10:09.437 --> 10:11.314
Good boy.

10:11.523 --> 10:13.858
There you go.

10:15.235 --> 10:16.611
Blue, one.

10:17.570 --> 10:19.155
Green, three.

10:19.364 --> 10:21.282
Yellow, two.

10:22.033 --> 10:24.452
Orange, five. Yellow, three.

10:24.661 --> 10:27.747
Red, four, green, two. Whoa. Whoa!

10:27.956 --> 10:30.959
That's too fast. I'm not a computer.

10:49.102 --> 10:54.065
I hope the acclimation process
wasn't too stressful.

10:54.899 --> 10:59.320
Blue, three. Yellow, six.
Orange, four.

10:59.529 --> 11:02.490
The perceptual tests
are the best way to determine

11:02.698 --> 11:06.452
whether you're ready
for our environment.

11:06.661 --> 11:09.580
We've prepared a meal for you.

11:10.456 --> 11:13.125
Not right now, thank you.

11:13.376 --> 11:17.797
We strongly recommend
that you get some rest.

11:18.339 --> 11:22.635
I think I'd like to take a look
at that engine room of yours.

11:22.843 --> 11:25.930
It's one deck above us.

12:14.561 --> 12:17.898
These are the teraphasic coils.

12:18.607 --> 12:21.944
The wider ones have lost
their cohesion.

12:22.152 --> 12:25.197
I'm sorry, you lost me.

12:26.406 --> 12:31.078
I'm having trouble concentrating
with all this noise and light.

12:31.286 --> 12:36.375
Are you certain you don't want
to rest for a while?

12:36.792 --> 12:39.920
I don't know what I'm certain about.

12:43.423 --> 12:47.135
- Mr Tucker again, sir.
- Put him through.

12:48.887 --> 12:52.516
- Yeah, Trip. How's it going?
- Not good.

12:52.724 --> 12:54.976
I don't think I'm gonna be
much help over here.

12:55.185 --> 12:58.063
I'm having a little more trouble
adjusting than I thought I would.

12:58.271 --> 13:03.610
- What's the problem?
- I feel like I've got a fever.

13:03.860 --> 13:07.197
I'm having trouble focusing, breathing.

13:07.572 --> 13:10.784
I really think I need
to get back, captain.

13:11.576 --> 13:13.662
Stand by for a minute.

13:13.912 --> 13:19.167
- T'Pol. Put me through to Trena'I.
- Stand by.

13:20.752 --> 13:23.046
Captain Archer?

13:23.254 --> 13:25.548
My man's not doing so well
over there.

13:25.757 --> 13:27.967
He'll be fine.

13:28.301 --> 13:32.055
With all due respect, I've known
Commander Tucker for eight years.

13:32.263 --> 13:34.057
He's tough as nails.

13:34.265 --> 13:37.101
If he says he's having problems,
I've gotta believe him.

13:37.310 --> 13:40.355
When he came out of decompression,
he refused to rest.

13:40.563 --> 13:43.274
I strongly suggest
he'd lie down for a while.

13:43.483 --> 13:45.276
You really think
that will make a difference?

13:45.485 --> 13:49.822
We have a good deal
of experience with alien visitors.

13:52.033 --> 13:55.244
I told Trena'I you'd try to get
at least an hour of shuteye.

13:55.453 --> 13:59.999
- He says that should do the trick.
- I just want out, sir. I'm not kidding.

14:00.208 --> 14:02.668
I can't take much more of this.

14:02.877 --> 14:06.339
Trena'I says they've dealt
with this before. Just one hour.

14:06.547 --> 14:09.467
If you're not feeling better,
we'll bring you back.

14:10.051 --> 14:11.886
It's not gonna work, captain.

14:13.137 --> 14:17.725
Take a nap, Trip. That's an order.
Archer out.

14:20.519 --> 14:26.067
We've prepared sleeping quarters
for you. It's not far.

14:45.294 --> 14:50.633
Your captain sent the recording.
He thought it might help you relax.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.761
Are you feeling better?

14:56.138 --> 14:57.765
What's that?

14:59.183 --> 15:02.478
Our food.
It grows all over the ship.

15:05.356 --> 15:07.816
Would you like some? It's very sweet.

15:08.484 --> 15:10.319
I think I'll pass.

15:12.363 --> 15:15.407
This is the closest
we could come to water.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.165
Trust me.

15:37.638 --> 15:39.431
Did that hurt?

15:40.265 --> 15:42.059
Not really.

15:51.860 --> 15:53.904
It's kind of nice.

15:55.072 --> 15:58.492
Does that happen when you people
touch each other?

15:59.576 --> 16:00.994
Something similar.

16:02.829 --> 16:04.789
Have you had enough?

16:06.333 --> 16:09.544
A man needs a lot of fluids
when he's under the weather.

16:24.642 --> 16:27.979
If you're feeling well enough, we really
should get back to the repairs.

16:29.856 --> 16:33.860
Could we take some of those with us?

16:37.113 --> 16:39.449
Are the injector cells aligned
with the primary coil?

16:39.657 --> 16:43.286
Aligned and locked.
You're not gonna believe this.

16:43.494 --> 16:45.705
They've got grass growing
on the floor.

16:45.914 --> 16:50.335
Real grass. It's even green.
Is Vulcan grass green?

16:50.543 --> 16:52.837
Have you tested the ion matrix,
commander?

16:53.046 --> 16:55.006
The grass releases
some kind of vapour.

16:55.214 --> 16:59.510
Helps them metabolise their food.
Smells just like a freshly mowed lawn.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.889
- The ion matrix, commander.
- Oh, right.

17:03.097 --> 17:06.099
I've recharged the assembly.
Is it up to .4 yet?

17:06.392 --> 17:09.145
- Point four-three.
- Keep pumping up the gradient.

17:09.353 --> 17:10.855
If we can get it up to .5,

17:11.063 --> 17:13.523
the coils should come back online
all by themselves.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.277
- Sounds like Trip's feeling better.
- Before you know it,

17:16.486 --> 17:20.281
he'll have that engine room running
like a well-oiled machine.

17:20.489 --> 17:23.159
- Tucker to Captain Archer.
- Go ahead, Trip.

17:23.409 --> 17:25.536
We're nearly ready to bring
the warp reactor online.

17:25.744 --> 17:27.747
Shouldn't take more than
a couple of hours.

17:27.954 --> 17:31.417
Just think, yesterday you would have
done anything to get out of there.

17:31.626 --> 17:33.544
Tucker out.

17:34.211 --> 17:37.506
It will take a while for the coils
to regenerate.

17:38.841 --> 17:42.303
Come with me. There's something
I want you to see.

17:57.818 --> 17:59.653
Watch this.

18:03.282 --> 18:07.036
That's Thera.
It's where I come from.

18:07.244 --> 18:09.413
The depth perception is incredible.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.333
What is it, a 3-D simulator
of some kind?

18:12.666 --> 18:14.668
It's holographic.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.880
Not like any hologram I've ever seen.

18:21.008 --> 18:23.469
It seems real, doesn't it?

18:25.804 --> 18:29.433
- How do you...?
- Resequenced photons.

18:29.892 --> 18:31.560
Come with me.

18:33.854 --> 18:37.608
- The perspective's changing.
- We could walk all the way to the city,

18:37.816 --> 18:40.485
and you'd never know
we're still in this room.

18:47.117 --> 18:48.785
Whoa.

18:50.495 --> 18:52.205
Sit down.

18:55.709 --> 18:59.463
We're still in the same room,
and this isn't a boat.

18:59.713 --> 19:02.048
It's a boat. It's just resequenced...

19:02.257 --> 19:05.594
- Resequenced photons.
- Exactly.

19:07.929 --> 19:11.850
If we had one of these on Enterprise,
I'd never ask for shore leave.

19:12.976 --> 19:14.394
You don't have any dermal plating.

19:14.603 --> 19:16.897
How do you detect
other people's moods?

19:17.314 --> 19:21.443
We don't. Well, actually, we do,

19:21.651 --> 19:24.487
but we do it through
observing behaviour.

19:24.904 --> 19:26.906
Getting to know someone.

19:27.115 --> 19:30.618
The follicles on your face,
if I'm not mistaken, they've grown.

19:31.786 --> 19:33.955
Do they have a purpose?

19:34.414 --> 19:36.458
Not that I know of.

19:36.875 --> 19:39.544
Normally we shave them off
with something called a razor,

19:39.794 --> 19:41.880
but I haven't had the chance
since I've been here.

19:42.088 --> 19:44.924
- Do you mind?
- Go ahead.

19:47.218 --> 19:50.305
- Does that hurt?
- Not in the least.

20:00.982 --> 20:03.985
- More water?
- No.

20:04.277 --> 20:06.696
This is a game we play.

20:06.988 --> 20:08.698
Watch.

20:14.495 --> 20:15.621
Go ahead.

20:28.843 --> 20:33.055
- Are there any rules to this game?
- It takes four hands to work.

20:47.528 --> 20:50.156
Your favourite food is...

20:50.364 --> 20:51.574
...catfish.

20:51.824 --> 20:54.660
- How the hell did you know that?
- What's mine?

20:55.244 --> 20:57.955
- Your what? Favourite food?
- Yes. Concentrate.

20:58.205 --> 20:59.790
What's my favourite food?

21:02.543 --> 21:04.336
Dutara root.

21:04.545 --> 21:05.629
How'd I know that?

21:05.880 --> 21:09.341
I wasn't certain the granules
would work with your species.

21:10.509 --> 21:14.555
Captain Archer saved your life once,
about four years ago.

21:14.763 --> 21:16.223
This is one hell of a game.

21:18.559 --> 21:20.769
You find me...

21:20.978 --> 21:22.146
...attractive.

21:23.147 --> 21:27.234
You like having people
find you attractive, don't you?

21:28.610 --> 21:29.820
Sometimes.

21:31.321 --> 21:34.450
Reactor Room to Ah'len.
The coils are coming back online.

21:34.658 --> 21:36.660
Understood.

21:46.503 --> 21:47.963
You'd better stand up.

22:04.104 --> 22:06.189
Decompression any easier
coming back?

22:06.398 --> 22:08.775
Three hours is three hours.

22:09.025 --> 22:11.945
You can't imagine what it was like
over there, Travis.

22:12.154 --> 22:16.491
Food growing on the walls,
teraphasic warp coils,

22:16.700 --> 22:19.619
boxes full of pebbles
that make you telepathic.

22:19.870 --> 22:22.831
- What were the Xyrillians like?
- A little shorter than us,

22:23.039 --> 22:25.083
weird scales on their faces.

22:25.292 --> 22:27.752
But otherwise, pretty much
like you and me.

22:27.961 --> 22:32.465
It sure was something.
Reminded me why I signed on.

22:33.633 --> 22:35.802
But it is good to be home.

22:37.303 --> 22:40.014
I hope your mission hasn't been
overly delayed.

22:40.265 --> 22:43.560
Getting a chance to meet
other species is our mission.

22:43.768 --> 22:45.603
I see you've got the visual
back online.

22:46.521 --> 22:48.064
Hoshi.

22:48.523 --> 22:50.358
Trena'I wanted to thank you again.

22:50.567 --> 22:52.944
I realize how dificult
it must have been,

22:53.152 --> 22:54.988
adapting to our environment.

22:55.238 --> 22:58.741
Well, it was worth every minute.
As long as those coils stay charged,

22:58.950 --> 23:02.203
you shouldn't have a problem
maintaining a stable warp field.

23:04.080 --> 23:06.624
Thanks for taking care of me
when I wasn't feeling so hot.

23:07.375 --> 23:08.918
It was worth every minute.

23:10.795 --> 23:12.672
Good luck to you.

23:18.803 --> 23:22.515
- Nice work, commander.
- I appreciate the opportunity, captain.

23:22.723 --> 23:26.978
I, for one, won't miss the malfunctions
their proximity was causing.

23:27.353 --> 23:29.147
Return to our previous heading, Travis.

23:29.355 --> 23:31.065
Aye, sir.

23:39.156 --> 23:40.783
Didn't they feed you over there?

23:40.992 --> 23:42.410
You should've come
with me, Malcolm.

23:42.618 --> 23:44.787
I heard about
the holographic recreation.

23:44.996 --> 23:47.415
It wasn't like any visual simulator
I've ever tried.

23:47.665 --> 23:49.542
It was more like actually being there.

23:49.750 --> 23:53.629
You could smell the ocean.
Feel the salt air on your skin.

23:53.879 --> 23:55.631
If we had one of those onboard,

23:55.840 --> 23:58.134
I can only imagine
what it would be used for.

23:58.342 --> 24:00.678
I don't know if they can
recreate people with it,

24:00.886 --> 24:02.721
but it sure did a hell of a job
on landscapes.

24:03.556 --> 24:05.099
Make any friends?

24:05.558 --> 24:07.309
Ah'len, one of their engineers.

24:07.518 --> 24:09.562
She's the one who showed me
the holographic chamber.

24:09.770 --> 24:11.981
Is she the one you thanked
for taking care of you?

24:12.189 --> 24:13.607
Yeah.

24:15.859 --> 24:18.320
Interesting scales.

24:19.613 --> 24:21.490
She did have a certain...

24:21.699 --> 24:24.118
...sensuality to her.

24:25.244 --> 24:26.495
So.

24:26.704 --> 24:30.624
- Did you get a look at their weapons?
- I don't even know if they had any.

24:31.625 --> 24:35.838
Have you tried these scrambled eggs?
Tastes just like the real thing today.

24:40.008 --> 24:42.010
Maybe you were allergic
to something over there.

24:42.219 --> 24:43.637
Well, I cleared bio-scan.

24:43.846 --> 24:47.182
Nevertheless, you'd better have
Dr Phlox take a look at it.

24:47.599 --> 24:50.018
Far as I know, I've never been allergic
to anything.

24:50.227 --> 24:53.730
I don't believe you're having
an allergic reaction.

24:54.314 --> 24:58.068
Tell me, did your visit
to the Xyrillian ship involve any...

24:58.276 --> 24:59.736
...romance?

24:59.945 --> 25:02.906
- What?
- Were you intimate with anyone?

25:03.115 --> 25:05.617
Doc, I was over there
to repair a warp reactor.

25:05.867 --> 25:07.994
What are you talking about?

25:08.245 --> 25:10.705
Seems you did a little more
than repair work.

25:11.581 --> 25:14.709
- Meaning?
- This is a nipple.

25:14.918 --> 25:16.753
I beg your pardon?

25:16.962 --> 25:20.882
The blastocyst is located between
the sixth and seventh intercostals.

25:21.091 --> 25:23.134
What the hell are you talking about?

25:23.385 --> 25:27.013
I'm not quite sure if congratulations
are in order, commander,

25:27.222 --> 25:29.349
but you're pregnant.

25:46.616 --> 25:47.784
Here.

25:47.992 --> 25:52.789
Do you see that cell cluster?
That is the embryo.

25:52.997 --> 25:57.502
I assume you'll be happy to know
that it's not technically your child.

25:57.710 --> 25:59.504
- What do you mean?
- When reproducing,

25:59.712 --> 26:02.549
the Xyrillians only utilize
the genetic material of the mother.

26:02.757 --> 26:05.802
The males simply serve as hosts.

26:06.010 --> 26:08.263
That's comforting.

26:08.471 --> 26:11.599
But how the hell did I get knocked up?

26:12.266 --> 26:14.227
We don't have any data
on their mating procedures,

26:14.435 --> 26:17.146
but I wouldn't think it would be
that difficult for you to recollect

26:17.355 --> 26:19.440
a sexual encounter.

26:21.109 --> 26:22.402
Three days.

26:22.652 --> 26:25.947
You were only there for three days,
and you couldn't restrain yourself.

26:26.155 --> 26:29.242
I'm telling you, captain, I was
a complete gentleman the entire time.

26:29.450 --> 26:33.287
I imagine that's a question
of how you define "gentleman."

26:33.621 --> 26:37.959
The only female I had any contact
with was Ah'len, their engineer.

26:38.167 --> 26:39.585
Other than repairing the reactor,

26:39.794 --> 26:43.130
all she and I did together was go into
this holographic chamber they've got.

26:43.339 --> 26:46.884
She showed me some home movies,
simulations of their planet.

26:47.093 --> 26:48.719
But I didn't lay a hand on her.

26:49.011 --> 26:52.139
There's gotta be some way to get
this thing out of me without hurting it.

26:52.348 --> 26:55.101
Can't you create a surrogate chamber
or something?

26:55.309 --> 26:57.186
The embryo has integrated
with your pericardium.

26:57.395 --> 26:58.938
I wouldn't be comfortable
extracting it

26:59.146 --> 27:01.399
without more information
on the gestation process.

27:01.607 --> 27:04.485
This engineer wanted you
to see her planet?

27:05.111 --> 27:06.278
So?

27:06.654 --> 27:10.324
Perhaps the next step would have
been to meet her holographic parents.

27:10.533 --> 27:14.745
If I'm not mistaken, on some planets,
that's a precursor to marriage.

27:15.037 --> 27:17.873
We took a ride in a rowboat.

27:18.290 --> 27:21.168
I swear, captain, nothing happened.

27:21.377 --> 27:24.463
There had to have been a somewhat
lengthy physical contact

27:24.672 --> 27:27.341
to transfer this much
genetic material.

27:28.425 --> 27:32.596
- Trip?
- I've been in Starfleet for 12 years.

27:32.805 --> 27:34.973
Do you think I'd jeopardize
my career by messing around

27:35.182 --> 27:37.476
with some alien engineer
on a three-day mission?

27:37.684 --> 27:39.436
I considered myself a diplomat

27:39.645 --> 27:42.564
from the minute I set foot
in that vessel.

27:44.367 --> 27:46.652
Well...

27:47.069 --> 27:49.446
...there was that box of pebbles.

27:49.863 --> 27:52.699
- Pebbles?
- Yeah, she had it on the boat.

27:52.908 --> 27:54.117
But it was no big deal.

27:54.326 --> 27:57.162
We just stuck our hands
into these granules for a few minutes.

27:57.371 --> 28:01.291
It's a game they play,
lets you read each other's minds.

28:01.500 --> 28:03.293
They weren't even real,
they were holographic,

28:03.502 --> 28:06.254
- just like everything else in the room.
- Doctor?

28:06.463 --> 28:08.799
Without a sample of these
telepathic granules,

28:09.007 --> 28:10.842
it would be impossible
to make a determination,

28:11.051 --> 28:13.678
but they could have served
as the transferral medium.

28:13.887 --> 28:16.181
One of the first things
a diplomat learns

28:16.390 --> 28:19.768
is not to stick his fingers
where they don't belong.

28:20.644 --> 28:22.187
Captain?

28:23.230 --> 28:26.650
If we're going to safely
remove this life form

28:26.858 --> 28:31.196
from Commander Tucker,
we'll have to find the Xyrillians.

28:31.404 --> 28:33.198
Why don't you and Malcolm
see what you can do

28:33.406 --> 28:34.950
- about locating their ship.
- Yes, sir.

28:35.158 --> 28:37.327
Is Trip well enough
to return to his duties?

28:37.535 --> 28:39.496
What, are you kidding? I'm fine.

28:39.704 --> 28:42.457
You'll probably feel a bit nauseated
in the mornings,

28:42.666 --> 28:45.752
so get sufficient rest and exercise,
and see me at least once a day.

28:46.586 --> 28:48.505
That nipple may not be
the only surprise

28:48.713 --> 28:50.715
your body has in store for you.

28:53.676 --> 28:57.347
You think we could keep this between
the four of us?

28:59.182 --> 29:01.434
At least for the time being.

29:03.811 --> 29:05.522
You got it.

29:25.833 --> 29:27.251
Dillard.

29:27.460 --> 29:30.505
- Sir?
- Look at this lift.

29:32.131 --> 29:34.634
- Sir?
- It's an accident waiting to happen.

29:34.842 --> 29:37.261
This safety bar's a metre off the floor.

29:37.470 --> 29:39.931
What use would it be
for a small person?

29:40.139 --> 29:43.684
- A small person?
- A short alien, a child.

29:43.893 --> 29:45.853
This thing's a deathtrap.

29:47.855 --> 29:50.191
Look at this handrail.

29:51.442 --> 29:54.403
Put your hands here
while this is going up or down...

29:55.696 --> 29:57.573
...it'll take your fingers right off.

29:57.823 --> 29:59.867
Why would someone
put their hands there, sir?

30:06.957 --> 30:08.793
Never mind.

30:10.628 --> 30:12.922
Captain's starlog, supplemental.

30:13.130 --> 30:15.633
We've spent eight days
looking for the Xyrillian ship,

30:16.091 --> 30:19.053
but so far, we've had no luck.

30:33.942 --> 30:36.278
- Sorry I'm late.
- No problem.

30:36.487 --> 30:37.738
How you feeling?

30:37.946 --> 30:41.450
I thought we all promised
to keep this under wraps.

30:42.076 --> 30:45.370
- I haven't said a thing. Doctor?
- Not a word.

30:45.621 --> 30:50.167
I knew it. She probably let it slip
the minute she left Sickbay.

30:50.417 --> 30:53.337
But Sub-commander T'Pol promised
to keep your pregnancy a secret.

30:53.795 --> 30:56.757
Where I'm from, Vulcans aren't known
for keeping promises.

30:57.174 --> 30:59.468
What makes you think
she's told anyone?

30:59.676 --> 31:03.680
All you have to do is see the way
they whisper, talk behind my back.

31:03.889 --> 31:05.349
You know what happened
this morning?

31:05.557 --> 31:08.352
Ensign Hart pulled out
my chair for me.

31:09.061 --> 31:12.356
I'm telling you, it was T'Pol,
and you can be sure it was intentional.

31:13.190 --> 31:16.068
- What's that?
- Chicken tetrazzini.

31:17.778 --> 31:21.156
- Did you cut yourself?
- I wish.

31:23.075 --> 31:26.119
I don't wanna ruin your appetites,
but...

31:27.078 --> 31:29.080
...take a look at this.

31:31.791 --> 31:34.252
Just how many of these
am I gonna grow?

31:34.503 --> 31:37.380
And while we're on the subject,
are they gonna go away afterward?

31:37.631 --> 31:41.468
One would think. Then again,
I have no experience with this species.

31:44.095 --> 31:45.680
Great.

31:47.515 --> 31:51.895
You know, it's been
over a week, Trip.

31:52.103 --> 31:54.981
We have to start considering
the possibility

31:55.231 --> 31:57.067
that we're not gonna find
the Xyrillians.

31:57.275 --> 31:59.444
What's that supposed to mean?

31:59.986 --> 32:03.948
Are you saying
I'm gonna deliver this baby?

32:04.199 --> 32:06.367
I believe he's saying a good deal
more than that.

32:06.576 --> 32:09.370
Once the child is born,
it may well rely on you

32:09.579 --> 32:11.122
in some way to care for it.

32:11.664 --> 32:16.920
I'm the chief engineer.
I spent years earning that position.

32:17.128 --> 32:20.006
I never had any intention
of becoming a working mother.

32:21.924 --> 32:26.346
You know, the doctor was saying
that the gestation period

32:26.554 --> 32:29.891
will only last another five weeks,
six at the most.

32:30.683 --> 32:34.062
You should expect to begin
experiencing some unusual symptoms.

32:34.270 --> 32:38.566
Hormonal changes, mostly.
Mood swings, heightened emotions.

32:38.816 --> 32:41.277
I suggest you stick
with the civilian clothes.

32:41.486 --> 32:44.113
Seems to help hide the bulge.

32:44.572 --> 32:46.199
How much bigger is this thing
gonna get?

32:46.449 --> 32:49.452
I'm already the laughingstock
of the ship.

32:51.537 --> 32:54.290
- I'd love some more of this.
- Yes, sir.

32:57.668 --> 33:00.838
I'd like you to start seeing the doctor
every eight hours.

33:01.797 --> 33:03.341
As your...

33:03.549 --> 33:07.261
...delivery date gets closer,
he should be able to start figuring out

33:07.470 --> 33:11.307
what your postnatal responsibilities
might be.

33:12.141 --> 33:14.268
Postnatal responsibilities?

33:14.518 --> 33:18.022
You may very well be putting those
nipples to work before you know it.

33:24.528 --> 33:27.865
- There's a bright side to all of this.
- Yeah?

33:28.073 --> 33:31.368
- What's that?
- As far as we know,

33:31.577 --> 33:35.539
this is the first inter-species
pregnancy involving...

33:35.831 --> 33:37.708
...a human.

33:40.502 --> 33:43.255
- Got something.
- Looks like their signature.

33:43.464 --> 33:47.301
Coordinates 078 mark six,
3 million kilometres.

33:47.509 --> 33:49.511
Change our heading to intercept.

33:49.720 --> 33:52.765
- Bridge to Archer.
- Go ahead.

33:52.973 --> 33:54.933
We may have found
the Xyrillian ship, sir.

33:56.393 --> 33:59.313
- Thank you.
- On our way.

34:07.321 --> 34:09.864
- What have you got?
- We're approaching the coordinates.

34:10.072 --> 34:13.577
I've analysed the stealth telemetry,
I believe it's them.

34:13.784 --> 34:15.411
Drop down to impulse.

34:15.621 --> 34:16.871
Hoshi, try to get an image.

34:21.043 --> 34:22.753
Doesn't look very stealthy to me.

34:23.253 --> 34:24.920
Go tighter.

34:28.967 --> 34:31.469
If the starship profiles
the Vulcans gave us are correct...

34:31.678 --> 34:33.763
They're correct, lieutenant.

34:34.514 --> 34:36.891
That's a Klingon battle cruiser.

34:44.357 --> 34:46.234
Where the hell are the Xyrillians?

34:46.443 --> 34:49.029
It appears your repairs
didn't last very long.

34:49.279 --> 34:52.907
If I'm correct, they're hiding
in the Klingons' plasma wake.

34:53.366 --> 34:54.451
Hoshi?

34:55.243 --> 34:57.746
The translation program should be
in pretty good shape, sir.

34:57.996 --> 35:01.791
Sir, with all due respect,
do we really think this is a wise idea?

35:02.000 --> 35:04.210
If we're gonna speak
to the Xyrillians,

35:04.419 --> 35:07.922
we can't do it without the Klingons
knowing about it.

35:08.298 --> 35:10.175
Open a channel.

35:11.509 --> 35:14.387
This is Captain Archer
of the starship Enterprise.

35:14.596 --> 35:16.222
We respectfully would like to ask

35:16.431 --> 35:18.391
for your assistance
with a little problem we're...

35:18.600 --> 35:21.811
- Sir, they're charging weapons.
- Polarize the hull plating.

35:22.061 --> 35:23.646
Grab hold of something.

35:26.441 --> 35:27.900
And another one.

35:29.193 --> 35:30.987
- Why are they attacking us?
- They're not.

35:31.195 --> 35:33.698
If they wanted to destroy Enterprise,
they would have done it.

35:33.906 --> 35:37.201
So I guess that's their version
of a warning shot across our bow.

35:37.410 --> 35:39.829
I don't recommend being the recipient
of another warning.

35:40.038 --> 35:41.539
Should I lay in a new course,
captain?

35:41.748 --> 35:45.835
No. Stay where you are.
Hail them again.

35:46.752 --> 35:49.589
Sir, look at their starboard nacelle.
The power's fluctuating

35:49.797 --> 35:52.466
just like ours did when the Xyrillians
were riding in our wake.

35:52.800 --> 35:54.760
They're responding.

35:56.137 --> 35:59.348
What gives you the right
to approach a Klingon warship?

35:59.557 --> 36:02.226
Please accept our apology.

36:02.518 --> 36:07.231
- But I need to ask you a question.
- And what would that be?

36:07.481 --> 36:10.985
Have you been experiencing
any unusual malfunctions?

36:11.235 --> 36:15.239
Problems with your gravity plating,
propulsion, environmental controls?

36:15.489 --> 36:17.158
You've been monitoring our systems.

36:17.366 --> 36:20.828
- For how long?
- We haven't. I promise you.

36:21.036 --> 36:23.747
The same things happened to us
a few days ago.

36:23.956 --> 36:26.667
Your problems are being caused
by a small stealth vessel

36:26.876 --> 36:28.377
that's been riding in your wake.

36:28.586 --> 36:31.881
They're using your plasma exhaust
to fuel their warp coils.

36:32.089 --> 36:35.050
- Find this vessel.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

36:35.301 --> 36:37.886
They're harmless.
We need them. Alive.

36:38.095 --> 36:41.765
- Just give me a chance to explain.
- Find them.

36:47.938 --> 36:50.482
- There are 36 aboard.
- Bring their captain to me

36:50.691 --> 36:52.026
and execute the others.

36:52.234 --> 36:54.903
Didn't you hear what I said?
I need them alive.

36:55.154 --> 36:59.074
What you need is to turn
your puny ship around and leave.

36:59.324 --> 37:03.495
These aliens violated our security
and disrupted our systems.

37:03.745 --> 37:06.832
Both are considered acts of war
against the Empire.

37:07.082 --> 37:10.919
I assure you that any damage
they've done was unintentional.

37:11.128 --> 37:15.090
- They're simply trying to get home.
- They won't get home.

37:15.299 --> 37:18.969
But I'm more than willing
to hasten their journey to Sto-Vo-Kor.

37:19.219 --> 37:21.596
- Sto-Vo...?
- The afterlife.

37:23.348 --> 37:25.892
You really don't wanna
hurt these people.

37:26.101 --> 37:27.811
They're actually very kind.

37:28.061 --> 37:30.731
They just had some bad luck
with their engines.

37:30.981 --> 37:33.442
When we confronted them,
they complied with all our requests.

37:33.650 --> 37:35.694
You're wasting my time!

37:37.946 --> 37:39.489
Less than one month ago,

37:39.739 --> 37:42.742
Captain Archer stood in the
High Council Chamber in Kronos.

37:43.118 --> 37:47.205
The chancellor himself called him
a man of honour. A brother.

37:47.414 --> 37:49.666
Enterprise is the ship
that found Klaang

37:49.875 --> 37:51.543
and returned him to the Empire.

37:51.751 --> 37:54.838
Without Klaang, your houses
would be at war with each other.

37:55.046 --> 37:58.842
Jonathan Archer is the man
who carried out that rescue.

37:59.092 --> 38:01.469
You are in his debt.

38:01.970 --> 38:05.432
You would be demonstrating
both honour and wisdom

38:05.640 --> 38:07.225
to grant his request.

38:10.603 --> 38:12.522
I'm the one who repaired
their warp reactor.

38:12.730 --> 38:15.942
Or at least I thought I did.

38:16.151 --> 38:21.072
I spent three days on their ship.
They have some amazing technology.

38:21.281 --> 38:23.616
If you don't kill them,
I'm sure they'd share it with you,

38:23.825 --> 38:27.537
- teach you how to use it.
- What kind of technology?

38:27.787 --> 38:31.165
Well, for one, they've got
some incredible holography.

38:31.374 --> 38:34.377
I don't know how advanced
Klingon holograms are,

38:34.585 --> 38:36.754
but these are like nothing
I ever saw before.

38:36.963 --> 38:40.091
Press a few buttons, you'll be standing
on a hillside overlooking Kronos.

38:40.341 --> 38:42.885
It's unbelievable.

38:43.094 --> 38:45.179
Couldn't hurt to take a look.

38:45.430 --> 38:47.598
Unless the decompression cycle
frightens you.

38:47.807 --> 38:51.144
I am frightened by nothing, P'tok.

38:51.769 --> 38:54.147
If you agree to enter their vessel,

38:54.355 --> 38:57.525
I'd appreciate it if you'd take
my chief engineer with you.

38:57.733 --> 39:01.779
He talks too much.
I'll bring a security team.

39:01.988 --> 39:04.574
He was there for three days.
They trust him.

39:04.782 --> 39:06.617
It'll make things a lot easier.

39:06.867 --> 39:10.955
If their technology amuses me,
I may spare their lives.

39:11.163 --> 39:14.375
I don't need your engineer
to help me make that decision.

39:14.583 --> 39:16.794
There's another reason.

39:19.046 --> 39:22.007
Commander Tucker has some...

39:22.216 --> 39:24.427
...unfinished business
with the Xyrillians.

39:24.635 --> 39:28.013
I am not interested
in your engineer's business.

39:28.722 --> 39:30.683
There's a pregnancy involved.

39:31.183 --> 39:33.811
I thought you said you were there
to fix their warp reactor,

39:34.019 --> 39:37.147
not to impregnate
one of their females.

39:37.398 --> 39:40.484
This should be a lesson to you.
Forget it happened.

39:41.610 --> 39:44.488
I'm afraid that's not gonna be
so easy.

39:46.657 --> 39:48.409
Show him.

40:06.802 --> 40:09.888
Captain Vorok has agreed
to consider releasing your ship

40:10.097 --> 40:15.602
in exchange for one or two
of your holographic simulators.

40:15.936 --> 40:19.690
It would be a good idea to cooperate.

40:20.065 --> 40:23.485
This is a topographical survey
of our capital.

40:25.112 --> 40:28.615
I'd be pleased to give you
a demonstration.

40:37.124 --> 40:40.544
The reactor worked fine for six days
then went off-line again.

40:41.503 --> 40:42.879
How did you find us?

40:43.380 --> 40:46.758
It wasn't easy, but we were very...

40:47.175 --> 40:48.802
...motivated.

40:49.469 --> 40:51.388
I don't understand.

40:59.896 --> 41:03.650
I had no idea this could happen
with another species.

41:04.651 --> 41:08.196
- If I'd known...
- No need to apologize.

41:08.446 --> 41:11.199
But I would be real appreciative
if you could get this out of me,

41:11.408 --> 41:13.410
assuming it's safe.

41:22.460 --> 41:26.381
It's still early enough to transfer
the embryo to another host.

41:28.758 --> 41:31.427
She looks very healthy.

41:33.263 --> 41:35.431
It's a girl, huh?

41:36.641 --> 41:38.768
I can see my house from here.

41:39.018 --> 41:42.939
Can this technology be adapted
to our power matrix?

41:43.356 --> 41:47.568
I'm sure we can make
the appropriate modifications.

41:51.614 --> 41:53.449
As soon as the installation
is complete,

41:53.658 --> 41:57.411
- the Xyrillians will be free to go.
- I appreciate your cooperation.

41:57.662 --> 42:00.998
I hope the next time we meet,
we can be of some help to you.

42:03.751 --> 42:07.964
Listen to me very carefully.
Our debt is repaid.

42:08.172 --> 42:12.093
We have no interest
in meeting you again.

42:12.635 --> 42:17.765
And if we do, I promise,
you'll regret it.

42:19.475 --> 42:21.268
The only thing worse
than spending three hours

42:21.477 --> 42:23.562
in a decompression chamber
with a bunch of Klingons

42:23.813 --> 42:26.315
is doing it twice in one day.

42:26.607 --> 42:29.318
I smelled things in there
I hope I never smell again.

42:29.819 --> 42:31.487
Trena'I told me that at full impulse,

42:31.695 --> 42:33.864
they can probably get home
in less than a month.

42:34.115 --> 42:36.575
No more hitchhiking?

42:41.872 --> 42:46.502
That business about the Klingon
chancellor calling me a brother...

42:48.587 --> 42:51.715
...was that true?
- Klingons are known to exaggerate.

42:52.258 --> 42:55.427
I saw nothing wrong
with doing the same.

43:00.599 --> 43:03.477
Your appetite seems to be
back to normal.

43:04.478 --> 43:06.814
Just eating for one again.

43:08.482 --> 43:10.776
I've run a check through
the Starfleet database.

43:11.026 --> 43:13.821
You might be pleased to know
that this is the first recorded incident

43:14.029 --> 43:16.073
of a human male
becoming pregnant.

43:18.700 --> 43:21.787
Just how I always wanted
to get into the history books.
