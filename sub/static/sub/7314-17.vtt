WEBVTT

00:12.178 --> 00:14.246
(door creaks)

00:19.085 --> 00:20.219
(cat meowing)

00:26.459 --> 00:28.093
(faucet squeaks,
turns water off)

00:39.239 --> 00:40.639
(sighs)

00:40.641 --> 00:42.141
(fingers squeak across mirror)

00:49.416 --> 00:50.749
(click, door creaks)

00:50.751 --> 00:53.118
(woman screams)

00:53.120 --> 00:53.819
(screeching)

01:24.517 --> 01:27.086
Reporter: <i>Metro police were</i>
<i>alerted by a 911 call</i>

01:27.088 --> 01:28.787
From a neighbor,
and while they're not releasing

01:28.789 --> 01:31.824
The young woman's name, police
say she fits the description

01:31.826 --> 01:34.193
Of the dead rose slasher's
previous victims.

01:34.195 --> 01:35.861
So after a three-year absence,

01:35.863 --> 01:38.263
It appears the slasher
has returned with a vengeance,

01:38.265 --> 01:40.499
Claiming two more young women
in the last week.

01:40.501 --> 01:43.802
I helped abby
add a third dead bolt

01:43.804 --> 01:48.874
You're asked to call the police
tip line at 202-555...

01:48.876 --> 01:51.577
I can't watch any more of this.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.879
(on tv): Do not approach him,
do not...

01:56.449 --> 01:58.283
How was the fishing trip?

01:58.285 --> 02:00.152
Didn't go.

02:00.154 --> 02:01.353
What?

02:01.355 --> 02:02.855
You look forward to that
every year.

02:02.857 --> 02:04.523
Yeah.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.825
Just didn't feel like it,
I guess.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.894
Something wrong?

02:11.364 --> 02:12.831
I'm worried
about cameron.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.601
I don't know,
since he got out of the navy,

02:15.603 --> 02:18.403
He hasn't found work;
he's very depressed.

02:18.405 --> 02:21.473
Ah, he's a kid, frankie;
he'll figure it out.

02:22.442 --> 02:24.510
Yeah.

02:25.645 --> 02:27.813
He's been acting
really strange, too.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.448
You talk to him?
Well...

02:29.450 --> 02:32.151
His mother had a way of getting
through to him.

02:32.153 --> 02:34.153
I don't.
(chuckles)

02:34.155 --> 02:36.755
You did a great job raising him
after she died.

02:37.724 --> 02:39.925
(sighs)

02:39.927 --> 02:41.326
What's the problem?

02:41.328 --> 02:45.597
You saw the police sketch
of the dead rose slasher.

02:47.467 --> 02:49.835
It looks just like cameron.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.271
It looks like a lot
of guys, frank.

02:52.273 --> 02:53.639
It's not just that.

02:56.576 --> 02:58.577
The murders started
four years ago,

02:58.579 --> 03:00.579
When cameron was a student
at hamilton.

03:00.581 --> 03:03.649
The first victim was a coed
there, and then they stopped

03:03.651 --> 03:05.884
For three years, when
he was away in the navy.

03:05.886 --> 03:08.620
But now they've started again
since he's come back home.

03:11.291 --> 03:13.792
It's probably
just a coincidence.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.794
I thought you didn't believe
in coincidences, gibbs.

03:16.763 --> 03:18.630
Do you remember when
he left college

03:18.632 --> 03:20.199
Middle of his sophomore year?

03:20.201 --> 03:21.333
Yeah, he got hurt.

03:21.335 --> 03:23.936
Lost his scholarship.

03:23.938 --> 03:26.805
The best left-handed quarterback
to come out of the

03:26.807 --> 03:27.973
Dc high schools.

03:29.242 --> 03:32.511
I was too ashamed
to tell you the truth.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.646
Cameron was accused
of date rape.

03:34.648 --> 03:37.950
Now, eventually all the charges
were dropped, but...

03:37.952 --> 03:39.952
He was thrown out.

03:39.954 --> 03:42.521
Long time ago, frank.

03:44.290 --> 03:47.993
Cameron wasn't at home the
nights of the last two killings.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.998
What do I do, gibbs?

03:53.000 --> 03:56.702
I mean, I can't go to the police
and say I suspect my own son.

03:58.538 --> 04:00.005
Well...

04:00.007 --> 04:02.608
Maybe I can give you
a little peace of mind--

04:02.610 --> 04:06.245
Ask around,
get metro pd

04:06.247 --> 04:10.782
To give me something that
eliminates cameron as a suspect.

04:10.784 --> 04:13.885
Can you do it without
giving up his name?

04:13.887 --> 04:18.323
It'll be the end of what's ever
left of our relationship.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.795
Thank you for letting me borrow
your controller, tim.

04:23.797 --> 04:26.031
You were right--
the yaw sensitivity

04:26.033 --> 04:27.899
Is outstanding.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.402
It anticipates your moves.
I was up half the night playing.

04:30.404 --> 04:31.536
Tony:
Playing?

04:31.538 --> 04:32.537
Instead of studying?

04:32.539 --> 04:34.039
Studying?

04:34.041 --> 04:36.041
Tony: Yeah, dorneget,
for your gs-11 exam.

04:37.310 --> 04:38.310
What is that?

04:40.346 --> 04:42.447
It's a test that probies
used to have to take

04:42.449 --> 04:44.950
To become journeyman agents.
It hasn't been given in years.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.718
Gibbs is the last agent
I know that took it.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.587
Oh.
Tony:
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

04:48.589 --> 04:51.323
The word is that director vance
is reinstating that test.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.458
You're messing with me.
Ziva: No, he is not.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.494
I heard the same thing
from hollander in hr.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.996
I'm glad I did not
have to take it.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.365
(sighs)
well, what kind of test is it?

05:00.367 --> 05:01.633
Tony:
Whew, it's tough.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.635
Comprehensive,
covers all the rules

05:03.637 --> 05:06.371
And then regs, procedures--
it's all in the manuals,

05:06.373 --> 05:08.340
Which you're gonna have to...
Know by heart.

05:08.342 --> 05:09.341
(footsteps approach)

05:09.343 --> 05:10.342
Here comes vance.

05:10.344 --> 05:11.677
You can ask
him yourself.

05:11.679 --> 05:16.648
Director vance.
Yeah, the bowl should be coming
off his head just about now.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.383
He should be here any second.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.353
Got something on
your mind, dorneget?
Uh...

05:22.355 --> 05:24.756
(sighs)
no, sir.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.860
Tell gibbs I need to see him.

05:31.397 --> 05:32.931
Abby, did you get
the security video I sent you?

05:32.933 --> 05:34.099
Check your e-mail, mcgee.

05:40.406 --> 05:42.574
How's director vance been today?

05:42.576 --> 05:45.077
He seems, um, fine.

05:45.079 --> 05:47.079
I'm worried about him.

05:48.047 --> 05:49.781
What's this?

05:49.783 --> 05:53.352
Ziva:
Lance corporal douglas alexander
and a mystery passenger

05:53.354 --> 05:55.053
Leaving the base at norfolk
three days ago.

05:55.055 --> 05:58.023
He stole over 120 grand
from the cash sales office

05:58.025 --> 06:00.959
He was assigned to.
Ziva: This is the last time
he was seen leaving the base.

06:00.961 --> 06:03.128
We have not been able
to find him. We put out a bolo

06:03.130 --> 06:05.697
And nothing.
Mcgee:
Well, he shouldn't
be too hard to spot.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.499
He's 220, six-five.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.434
Well, I removed
the reflection

06:09.436 --> 06:12.671
And then I enhanced
the passenger's face.
Tony: Look at that.

06:12.673 --> 06:15.407
An attractive woman.
Abby:
I ran the image
through facial

06:15.409 --> 06:17.542
Recognition, and I got a name.
Gibbs:
What is it?

06:19.779 --> 06:22.447
Abby: Melissa tourney.
She's a civilian.

06:22.449 --> 06:23.982
We find her, we'll find him.

06:24.951 --> 06:27.052
Nice haircut,
agent gibbs.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.822
I'm gonna go back
to the evidence locker.

06:31.791 --> 06:33.658
Uh, boss, vance
is looking for you.

06:35.995 --> 06:38.630
Ziva: He went back
to his office.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.098
Strange.

06:44.837 --> 06:47.706
(siren wailing)

06:47.708 --> 06:49.875
Detective,
you I.D.'d the girl?

06:49.877 --> 06:51.910
Uh, yeah, but we're not
releasing the name yet.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.179
You'll give me an exclusive?
Come on, bart.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.548
The chief's having a press
conference this afternoon.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.417
You'll find out
when everybody else does.

06:59.519 --> 07:01.052
Detective shard?

07:01.054 --> 07:03.655
Special agent
gibbs, ncis.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.757
Ncis?

07:05.759 --> 07:07.192
How can I help you?

07:07.194 --> 07:09.194
Well, we're investigating
an attempted homicide.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.196
Got a witness...
Described a guy

07:11.198 --> 07:13.465
Looks a lot like the sketch
of your dead rose slasher.

07:13.467 --> 07:16.835
Yeah? And you think we're
looking for the same person?

07:16.837 --> 07:18.770
I don't know.
What's the sketch based on?

07:18.772 --> 07:21.173
Witness saw a guy
running from the scene

07:21.175 --> 07:23.508
Of victim number two's murder
three years ago.

07:23.510 --> 07:27.512
Huh. What makes you think
the same guy's killing again?

07:27.514 --> 07:30.916
Everything.
Girls all fit a profile.

07:30.918 --> 07:34.653
Same type of weapon.
Bodies posed the same way.

07:34.655 --> 07:37.856
The guy leaves a... Dead rose
on the victim's chest.

07:37.858 --> 07:40.225
You got a fingerprint?
You got any dna?

07:40.227 --> 07:42.494
That would make it too easy.

07:42.496 --> 07:45.130
This guy's
real careful.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.532
Must be
wearing gloves.

07:47.534 --> 07:49.534
How about yours?

07:49.536 --> 07:51.870
You got anything that can
eliminate my suspect?

07:51.872 --> 07:54.873
(sighs) stab wounds suggest
that he's left-handed.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.241
Your guy left-handed?

07:58.778 --> 08:01.680
You know... I'll check.

08:01.682 --> 08:02.747
Not sure.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.759
Melissa tourney, 28,
is a professional dancer.

08:14.761 --> 08:19.197
Works under the name
of misty blue.
Sounds like a stripper.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.866
Tony: Is a stripper.
At a club in anacostia.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.000
I just caught the lunch show.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.268
It's pretty good.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.703
Comes with a couple
of ginger ales

08:24.705 --> 08:26.738
And a bacon double cheeseburger.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.207
Just following the lead, boss.

08:29.209 --> 08:30.642
Spoke with a couple
of the girls.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.010
One of them told me
that melissa met

08:32.012 --> 08:33.678
Our lance corporal
a couple weeks ago.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.547
They've been hot and heavy
ever since.

08:35.549 --> 08:37.516
She hasn't shown up for work
the past three nights.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.818
While he was busy talking
to the <i>other</i> girls,

08:39.820 --> 08:43.522
The landlady said she packed up
and left yesterday.

08:43.524 --> 08:44.956
Did not leave
a forwarding address.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.125
But we're pretty sure
we know where she is now.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.127
She bought a ticket.
Paid cash.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.796
Reagan national to charlotte
with a connecting flight

08:51.798 --> 08:53.064
To freeport,
grand bahamas.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.100
Left the country,
traveling alone?

08:55.102 --> 08:56.768
Looks that way.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.103
She booked herself into a resort

08:58.105 --> 08:59.671
On the east end
of the island.

08:59.673 --> 09:00.906
Tony: Lance corporal
alexander'll show up.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.674
Certainly worth
a trip down there.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.609
You volunteering for that,
are you, dinozzo?

09:04.611 --> 09:08.046
Stripper, caribbean beach--
is that a trick question?

09:08.048 --> 09:10.615
Behave yourself, skippy.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.852
Aye, aye, sir.

09:14.820 --> 09:16.855
You're not sending him alone.

09:16.857 --> 09:20.625
Hey, spring dorneget out of
the evidence locker, will you?

09:20.627 --> 09:22.294
Dorneget?
Gibbs:
Yeah.

09:22.296 --> 09:23.962
I need you and ziva here.
Tony:
Don't worry, tim,

09:23.964 --> 09:25.797
I'll bring you back a t-shirt.

09:26.933 --> 09:28.800
(sighs)

09:30.736 --> 09:33.738
Hey, duck.
Just a second.
(panting)

09:33.740 --> 09:36.808
Since the weather broke, I-I've
been running at lunchtime.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.810
Part of my cardio-rehab.

09:38.812 --> 09:42.847
Managed to lower my resting
heart rate by almost 20%

09:42.849 --> 09:45.750
Since my little episode
last year.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.086
Hey, I need a favor.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.854
You still tight
with the city m.E.?

09:49.856 --> 09:52.691
Tom hubbard? Yes, we play
bridge every Wednesday.

09:52.693 --> 09:55.860
He was a little upset the other
night when I trumped his ace,

09:55.862 --> 09:58.163
But, uh, when we
won the rubber,

09:58.165 --> 09:59.965
He forgave me.
Well...

09:59.967 --> 10:03.301
He did all the autopsies on
the dead rose slasher victims.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.804
Yeah?
And I'm wondering if

10:05.806 --> 10:08.907
He found anything that could
eliminate someone as a suspect.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.843
I don't want metro pd
to know who's asking.

10:11.845 --> 10:14.846
So y-you want me to con
the information out of him?

10:17.817 --> 10:19.351
May I ask why?

10:22.154 --> 10:23.855
Helping a friend.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.857
Ah.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.759
Okay.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.698
Dorney.

10:33.700 --> 10:36.368
Hey, you hear I'm going
to the bahamas?

10:36.370 --> 10:38.737
Yeah. Yeah,
with, uh, tony.
Yeah.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.939
I got to get back to my place,
pack and set my dvr.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.941
He's picking me up in an hour.
Listen,

10:42.943 --> 10:44.342
Don't let him "probie" you.

10:44.344 --> 10:47.312
What?
I've been there, dorney.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.780
Tony's gonna pull rank.

10:49.749 --> 10:50.982
I can handle him.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.751
Watch your back, dorney.

10:55.755 --> 10:58.289
Ziva:
Cameron dean's life started
falling apart after high school.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.892
In his second year of college,
a sorority girl

11:00.894 --> 11:02.260
Accused him of date rape,

11:02.262 --> 11:04.129
But charges
were eventually dropped.

11:04.131 --> 11:06.131
He left college
and enlisted in the navy.

11:06.133 --> 11:08.133
Mcgee: He was overseas
for nearly three years,

11:08.135 --> 11:10.669
But he got discharged,
is now in the reserves.

11:10.671 --> 11:13.838
Seems to have straightened out
but is, um, currently living

11:13.840 --> 11:15.874
At home with his father,
collecting unemployment.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.075
Any criminal record?

11:17.077 --> 11:19.678
No.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.980
Can you... Tell us why
we're looking at him?

11:24.784 --> 11:26.785
His father's
an old friend of mine,

11:26.787 --> 11:29.354
And he is worried
that his son

11:29.356 --> 11:31.423
Might be the dead rose slasher.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.060
Sure looks like the sketch.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.197
Not our case.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.366
And I don't want to give
him over to the police

11:41.368 --> 11:43.168
Unless this is something more
than a father's paranoia.

11:43.170 --> 11:46.838
So... If you don't want
to help on this...

11:46.840 --> 11:50.108
Hey... I get it.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.711
Whatever you need, gibbs.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.779
If you can get his cell phone
number, we can locate him

11:54.781 --> 11:56.081
And discreetly check him out.

11:58.984 --> 12:01.086
Thank you.

12:13.966 --> 12:16.034
(door creaks open, then shuts)

12:18.471 --> 12:21.039
(footsteps approaching)

12:21.041 --> 12:22.907
Hey, leon.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.909
You mind some company?

12:24.911 --> 12:27.078
I have an hour left
with the babysitter.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.448
Yeah? Where'd you go?
Supposedly group
bereavement counseling.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.817
Couldn't do it, so...

12:32.819 --> 12:36.121
I'm consoling myself with
some double chocolate brownies.

12:36.123 --> 12:38.890
Would you care to join me?
I hate to eat alone.

12:48.234 --> 12:50.068
How you doing?

12:50.070 --> 12:51.903
I'll be fine.

12:51.905 --> 12:54.072
Just need some space.

12:54.074 --> 12:56.207
I don't need people
smothering me with...

12:56.209 --> 12:58.910
Sympathy, poor-him,
puppy-dog looks.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.979
You talking about abby?
Mm-hmm.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.981
Yeah, she means well.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.016
I know.
Abby's got a
big heart, leon.

13:05.018 --> 13:07.318
She's just trying to help you
any way she can.
Mm.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.187
And I appreciate
the brownie.

13:10.489 --> 13:13.558
Why are you really here?

13:14.527 --> 13:16.528
I'm back on the job, gibbs.

13:16.530 --> 13:18.930
I don't like being
out of the loop.

13:19.932 --> 13:21.933
Chief of metro detectives
called asking me:

13:21.935 --> 13:25.870
Why are you sticking your nose
in the dead rose slasher case?

13:25.872 --> 13:28.006
Said you were
at the crime scene,

13:28.008 --> 13:30.375
Dr. Mallard questioned his m.E.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.076
Nah, it's nothing official,
leon.

13:32.078 --> 13:34.045
I was just checking something
out for a friend.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.181
Well, must be a good friend.

13:36.183 --> 13:39.117
Yeah, he's been there for me.

13:41.921 --> 13:43.454
All right.

14:11.150 --> 14:13.885
(sighs)
hi.

14:26.432 --> 14:28.366
Have you ever had
the burger here?

14:28.368 --> 14:30.468
Uh, sorry, no.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.971
Do you live in
the neighborhood?

14:32.973 --> 14:34.305
Excuse me?

14:34.307 --> 14:37.542
I'm just visiting,
and, um...

14:37.544 --> 14:39.377
This menu does
nothing for me.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.180
Would you be able to recommend
anything else around here?

14:42.182 --> 14:44.883
No, not... Not really.

14:46.352 --> 14:48.019
Hey...

14:48.021 --> 14:49.654
I'm abby.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.556
Hey, abby.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.626
I'd really love to stay
and chat, but I have to go.

14:54.628 --> 14:57.195
Yeah, sure.
Some other time.

15:00.366 --> 15:01.566
We better follow him.

15:01.568 --> 15:02.600
Yeah, she fits the profile

15:02.602 --> 15:04.135
Of all the other victims--
come on.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.937
Let's go.

15:28.093 --> 15:30.395
Ah, look at that.

15:30.397 --> 15:32.096
You're too much.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.097
Thank you.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.165
Mm-hmm.

15:35.367 --> 15:37.135
Uh, hey.

15:39.204 --> 15:41.072
Dorneget.

15:41.074 --> 15:42.640
You're supposed to beat

15:42.642 --> 15:44.275
The senior field
agent to work.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.210
I'm so sorry,
but the front desk

15:46.212 --> 15:48.146
Called me at, like, 3:00 a.M.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.213
Why?

15:49.215 --> 15:50.949
They said I ordered
a wake-up call.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.050
Can you believe that?

15:52.052 --> 15:54.085
It took me forever
to get back to sleep,

15:54.087 --> 15:55.586
And then I guess I slept in.

15:55.588 --> 15:58.523
I-I-I'm... I'm sorry,
agent dinozzo,

15:58.525 --> 16:00.058
I promise it won't happen again.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.160
It's "tony"
when we're on stakeout.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.028
The idea is we're supposed
to blend in.

16:04.030 --> 16:05.196
Right.

16:05.198 --> 16:06.731
Speaking of which,
what in the name

16:06.733 --> 16:08.099
Of brooks brothers
are you wearing?

16:08.101 --> 16:09.701
You look like exactly
what you are:

16:09.703 --> 16:11.269
A pubescent federal agent.

16:11.271 --> 16:14.072
Now, while you
were sleeping,

16:14.074 --> 16:15.173
I was already on the job.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.175
Melissa tourney
left the royal suite

16:17.177 --> 16:19.043
This morning, all alone.

16:19.045 --> 16:20.044
Where is she now?

16:20.046 --> 16:21.179
If you can be discreet,

16:21.181 --> 16:22.613
She's the blonde in the bikini

16:22.615 --> 16:24.315
With the smoking-hot
body by the waterfall,

16:24.317 --> 16:25.450
Over your left shoulder.

16:25.452 --> 16:26.617
<i>Left</i> shoulder.

16:26.619 --> 16:29.120
Stop it.
Oh, my god, stop.

16:30.222 --> 16:33.057
We're gonna have
to work on that.

16:33.059 --> 16:36.194
She's the kind of gal
my father would say

16:36.196 --> 16:38.129
You want to make cookies with.

16:38.131 --> 16:40.198
So, do we just wait around

16:40.200 --> 16:41.699
For lance corporal alexander
to show?

16:41.701 --> 16:43.768
Yeah, that's
exactly what we do.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.137
And we hope it takes him
a couple days to show,

16:46.139 --> 16:49.073
So we can enjoy this
little slice of paradise.

16:49.075 --> 16:52.143
Why don't you go find
something beachy to wear?

16:52.145 --> 16:53.144
Hit the gift shop.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.480
I'm gonna call
the office.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.548
Okay.

16:58.317 --> 17:00.385
Get some sunblock.

17:02.121 --> 17:03.788
How is dorneget doing?

17:03.790 --> 17:07.692
I pulled the old 3:00 a.M.
Wake-up on him.

17:07.694 --> 17:08.693
Course you did.

17:08.695 --> 17:09.694
Give him a break, tony.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.129
Hey, mcgander.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.730
Check this out.

17:12.732 --> 17:13.765
You see anything like that

17:13.767 --> 17:15.133
On the metrorail this morning?

17:15.135 --> 17:16.234
Hi, ladies.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.736
Wow. Looking good.

17:18.738 --> 17:19.771
Looking very good.

17:21.173 --> 17:22.173
I like the purple.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.141
You make an arrest

17:23.143 --> 17:24.409
Already, did you, dinozzo?

17:25.377 --> 17:26.411
Boss, uh...

17:26.413 --> 17:28.046
No, well, I, uh...

17:29.415 --> 17:31.416
You find cameron dean
last night?

17:31.418 --> 17:34.285
Traced his cell to a bar
near union station.

17:34.287 --> 17:38.589
But he was distracted
by a younger woman.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.358
He could not take
his eyes off her.

17:40.360 --> 17:43.061
Fits the profile
of the slasher victims.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.162
After she left the bar,

17:44.164 --> 17:45.763
He followed her.
Ziva: We tailed him,

17:45.765 --> 17:47.532
A couple of blocks
to an apartment building.

17:47.534 --> 17:50.835
He never approached her,
and left after she went inside.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.270
Where'd he go after that?
Mcgee:
Back to his father's house.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.739
Lights went off
in his room at 1:00 a.M.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.307
His father's a barber.

17:56.309 --> 17:58.142
Boss, he wouldn't
happen to be yours...

17:58.144 --> 17:59.710
Guys, later, okay? Later.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.345
Gibbs.
Hey.

18:01.347 --> 18:03.448
What are you doing here?
You weren't
very forthcoming.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.349
Thought I'd check in
with director vance.

18:05.351 --> 18:08.419
He assures me ncis
will share information

18:08.421 --> 18:10.121
That's pertinent
to my investigation.

18:10.123 --> 18:11.155
We will.

18:11.157 --> 18:12.723
So, give me the name
of your suspect.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.460
Vance claims, uh,
he doesn't know it.

18:15.462 --> 18:16.427
It is premature.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.862
All we have now is someone

18:17.864 --> 18:19.864
With a passing resemblance
to your sketch.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.299
I'd like to talk to him.

18:21.301 --> 18:22.633
What's the harm?

18:22.635 --> 18:25.303
Is there anything
other than left-handed

18:25.305 --> 18:28.506
That would eliminate
or incriminate my guy?

18:28.508 --> 18:30.775
So your guy <i>is</i> left-handed.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.344
(gibbs chuckles, phone rings)

18:33.346 --> 18:35.279
Yeah, it's gibbs.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.348
Ducky: You have a moment?
Mm-hmm.

18:37.350 --> 18:38.616
I'll be right there.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.585
I gotta go.

18:40.587 --> 18:43.354
We'll be in touch.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.132
Bill shard.

18:56.768 --> 18:58.369
So, what do you do here?

18:58.371 --> 19:00.271
I'm special agent david.

19:03.442 --> 19:05.309
You've been to israel.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.479
Yeah.

19:08.481 --> 19:09.514
I was born there.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.415
Shalom.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.454
I spoke with dr. Hubbard.

19:16.456 --> 19:17.788
Yeah, I know you did.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.190
Oh?

19:19.192 --> 19:20.625
Uh, he reported
your conversation

19:20.627 --> 19:23.227
To the chief of detectives,
who called director vance.

19:23.229 --> 19:25.863
And I thought
I was so circumspect.

19:25.865 --> 19:26.864
Doc, don't
worry about it.

19:26.866 --> 19:28.332
Chief complained
about me, too.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.834
Hubbard tell
you anything?

19:29.836 --> 19:32.436
Yeah, that, uh...
Two recent murders

19:32.438 --> 19:35.339
Are identical
to those three years ago.

19:35.341 --> 19:36.841
Based on the stab wounds,
the killer is

19:36.843 --> 19:38.476
Most definitely
left-handed.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.178
And the same
type and size

19:40.180 --> 19:41.412
Of blade was used
in all cases.

19:41.414 --> 19:42.680
The killer leave
any forensic evidence?

19:42.682 --> 19:46.751
But hubbard did reveal
something interesting.

19:46.753 --> 19:50.221
Besides being in the same
physical phylum,

19:50.223 --> 19:53.257
All of the young ladies
were intravenous drug users.

19:53.259 --> 19:55.593
Detective shard
didn't mention that.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.461
I thought he was
holding something back.

19:57.463 --> 19:58.796
That's funny
you should say that.

19:58.798 --> 20:01.232
Hubbard has a tell
when we play cards.

20:01.234 --> 20:04.468
A little twitch when
he's hiding a good hand.

20:04.470 --> 20:07.438
Last night,
the old boy was

20:07.440 --> 20:09.340
Twitching like a worm on a hook.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.209
There's something
they're not telling us.

20:11.211 --> 20:12.677
Ah.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.612
Thanks.

20:16.515 --> 20:17.982
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

20:17.984 --> 20:19.450
But I hate the bahamas.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.886
I <i>hate</i> the bahamas.

20:21.888 --> 20:22.954
Hey, tony!

20:22.956 --> 20:23.955
Tony!

20:23.957 --> 20:25.223
Here's your burger.

20:25.225 --> 20:26.524
What took you so long?

20:26.526 --> 20:28.359
I had to wait in line.

20:28.361 --> 20:29.961
There's mustard
all over this thing.
I hate mustard.

20:29.963 --> 20:31.429
Then scrape it off.

20:31.431 --> 20:32.997
Take the burger back.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.365
Uh-uh. No way.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.434
I am not your personal
assistant, tony.

20:36.436 --> 20:37.802
Are you getting feisty with me?

20:37.804 --> 20:40.004
Mcgee warned me you'd
play the probie card.

20:40.006 --> 20:42.573
I... Read the regs.

20:42.575 --> 20:45.409
"a senior agent cannot
order a probationary agent

20:45.411 --> 20:47.511
To perform personal services."

20:47.513 --> 20:49.013
You brought your
manuals with you.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.748
I have to study
for my gs-11.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.451
Well, take this back
before I slap you silly.

20:53.453 --> 20:54.619
(gasps softly)

20:54.621 --> 20:57.488
Dorneget:
She's staring at us.

20:57.490 --> 20:58.623
She's staring at me.

20:58.625 --> 20:59.890
She has been for the last hour.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.626
Why?

21:02.861 --> 21:04.629
Maybe it's time I made contact.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.364
Should you do that?

21:06.366 --> 21:08.532
She'll think
it's weird if I don't.

21:08.534 --> 21:11.535
Watch and learn.

21:16.375 --> 21:17.541
Hi.

21:17.543 --> 21:19.610
Hi.

21:19.612 --> 21:20.878
Couldn't help notice

21:20.880 --> 21:22.647
You're sitting here all alone.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.949
I thought maybe you'd
want some company?

21:24.951 --> 21:26.317
Sure.

21:26.319 --> 21:28.586
Your partner won't mind?

21:28.588 --> 21:30.655
"partner"?

21:30.657 --> 21:33.624
Oh, I assumed you
two were a couple.

21:33.626 --> 21:36.727
Just your shirt...

21:36.729 --> 21:37.728
It's so pink.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.897
(chuckles)

21:39.899 --> 21:42.466
Man: <i>It's the third time</i>
<i>the dead rose slasher</i>

21:42.468 --> 21:44.835
Has struck the downtown area
in the last two weeks.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.837
The latest victim was killed
early this morning,

21:46.839 --> 21:48.506
Her body found in an alley

21:48.508 --> 21:50.474
Across the street
from this hotel,

21:50.476 --> 21:51.509
Which is known to be frequented

21:51.511 --> 21:53.444
By drug users and prostitutes.

21:53.446 --> 21:55.379
Got my fingers crossed
it's not the girl

21:55.381 --> 21:56.580
We saw from the bar last night.

21:56.582 --> 21:58.683
She did not look like
a drug addict.

21:58.685 --> 22:00.618
Her name's being withheld
pending notification

22:00.620 --> 22:02.353
Of next of kin,
but I've been told

22:02.355 --> 22:04.989
Told she resembles the other
dead rose slasher victims.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.491
(phone ringing)
any idea where your guy
was last night?

22:07.493 --> 22:09.627
I'm sure detective shard
is gonna ask me the same thing.

22:09.629 --> 22:10.795
That's him calling
me right now.

22:10.797 --> 22:11.762
Yeah, it's gibbs.

22:11.764 --> 22:13.497
This is a courtesy call, gibbs,

22:13.499 --> 22:15.933
To let you know that I'm picking
up cameron dean for questioning.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.068
How'd you get his name?

22:17.070 --> 22:18.536
A little talent I acquired.

22:18.538 --> 22:20.771
I can read upside down.

22:20.773 --> 22:22.873
I saw his picture and his name

22:22.875 --> 22:24.542
On that cute agent's desk.

22:24.544 --> 22:27.345
Shard: We'll keep in touch.
(hangs up, phone beeps off)

22:27.347 --> 22:29.113
Shard has cameron
dean's name.

22:29.115 --> 22:30.648
How did he get it?

22:30.650 --> 22:31.882
Ziva, find the woman
he was following and

22:31.884 --> 22:34.852
Mcgee, get cameron dean in here

22:34.854 --> 22:36.721
Before metro finds him.

22:36.723 --> 22:38.389
I'll call the metro chief
and the commissioner

22:38.391 --> 22:40.725
And run interference.

22:48.133 --> 22:50.601
Don't look like you
have good news.

22:50.603 --> 22:52.036
I want to ask you
something, frank.

22:52.038 --> 22:54.071
Was cameron home this morning?

22:54.073 --> 22:55.973
He was gone when I got up.

22:55.975 --> 22:58.576
Why, you think
he killed

22:58.578 --> 23:00.644
That girl they found
in the alley?
No.

23:00.646 --> 23:02.780
But the police are gonna
call him in for questioning.

23:02.782 --> 23:03.948
What happened?

23:03.950 --> 23:06.984
Did they have evidence
that points to cameron?

23:06.986 --> 23:10.688
No. They learned we were
checking him out.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.456
How?

23:12.458 --> 23:13.991
I'm gonna do
everything I can, okay?
Well, what happened?

23:13.993 --> 23:15.926
Did you give him up to the cops?
No.

23:15.928 --> 23:18.129
No. We got careless.

23:18.131 --> 23:20.598
I should have never
said anything to you.

23:20.600 --> 23:24.135
No, you did
the right thing.

23:26.671 --> 23:29.573
What happened to my son?

23:44.022 --> 23:45.990
Cameron.

23:45.992 --> 23:48.893
Special agent gibbs.

23:48.895 --> 23:50.995
Are you gonna be
the one to tell me

23:50.997 --> 23:52.563
What the hell's
going on here?

23:52.565 --> 23:56.567
Gibbs: Where were you
just before dawn this morning?

23:56.569 --> 23:58.502
I was looking for work.

23:59.504 --> 24:01.539
What time did you
leave your house?

24:01.541 --> 24:03.441
About a quarter to 6:00.

24:03.443 --> 24:04.975
There was a construction company

24:04.977 --> 24:06.977
That was hiring day laborers.

24:06.979 --> 24:08.946
It's a first come,
first serve kind of thing.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.982
I didn't get it.

24:19.958 --> 24:21.926
Why were you following
her last night?

24:21.928 --> 24:24.662
What the hell is this all about?

24:29.034 --> 24:31.869
Do you think that
I'm the serial killer?

24:31.871 --> 24:34.772
Why were you following her?

24:37.108 --> 24:40.110
I was doing a favor
for a shipmate.

24:40.112 --> 24:42.513
He's stationed
in bahrain.

24:42.515 --> 24:43.981
This is his wife,

24:43.983 --> 24:46.550
And he thinks that
she's cheating on him.

24:46.552 --> 24:48.953
He asked me
to do him a favor,

24:48.955 --> 24:52.056
So I followed her around
to see what she was up to.

24:52.058 --> 24:53.891
That's it.

24:53.893 --> 24:55.192
I'm taking him into custody.

24:55.194 --> 24:57.895
Is in the middle
of an interrogation.

24:57.897 --> 24:59.563
You have no jurisdiction

24:59.565 --> 25:01.899
In my case,
director vance.

25:07.038 --> 25:10.040
If your agents do anything to
jeopardize our investigation

25:10.042 --> 25:12.743
Or prosecution in this case,
you'll face charges.

25:12.745 --> 25:15.079
We have our own reasonings
for questioning mr. Dean.

25:16.648 --> 25:18.916
You got a problem?

25:18.918 --> 25:21.085
Turn over the suspect.

25:21.087 --> 25:23.053
We're holding him for 24 hours.

25:23.055 --> 25:24.922
For what?
Stalking a navy
dependent.

25:24.924 --> 25:27.258
This woman-- we checked;
she's alive.

25:27.260 --> 25:28.526
It doesn't mean
that he didn't kill the woman

25:28.528 --> 25:29.593
We found this morning.

25:30.896 --> 25:32.897
Look at him!

25:32.899 --> 25:35.065
He could've posed
for the sketch.

25:35.067 --> 25:38.068
I want access to your files
on the serial killings.

25:38.070 --> 25:39.670
Yeah, right.

25:39.672 --> 25:40.971
You got big ones, gibbs.

25:40.973 --> 25:42.640
Vance:
The point is moot,
detective shard.

25:42.642 --> 25:43.874
I talked to your chief.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.543
He told me how backed up
your lab is.

25:45.545 --> 25:46.944
I offered our assistance.

25:46.946 --> 25:49.046
He thought a fresh set
of eyes might be helpful.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.015
All the physical evidence
is on its way over.

26:28.987 --> 26:30.287
(keypad beeping)

26:30.289 --> 26:33.290
Hey, want some help
with that?

26:33.292 --> 26:35.225
Yeah, sure.

26:35.227 --> 26:38.762
(chuckles)
the bronze master.

26:38.764 --> 26:41.131
(phone ringing)
ooh.

26:43.134 --> 26:45.836
Is your friend
checking up on you?

26:45.838 --> 26:47.104
(text alert chimes)

26:47.106 --> 26:48.172
Oh...

26:49.074 --> 26:51.208
My friend.

26:51.210 --> 26:53.611
Oh, he just got here.

26:53.613 --> 26:55.946
I knew it was too good
to be true.

26:55.948 --> 26:58.616
Well... See ya.

26:58.618 --> 27:00.618
Bye.

27:00.620 --> 27:02.686
Tony:
Bye.

27:03.822 --> 27:05.889
See ya.
See ya round.

27:10.128 --> 27:11.929
(speaks quietly)
what?

27:11.931 --> 27:13.631
(speaking quietly)

27:13.633 --> 27:15.099
Hey, melissa.

27:15.101 --> 27:17.101
Aren't you gonna
introduce me?

27:17.103 --> 27:20.804
Who is this guy?
Just someone
I met at the pool.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.673
Come on... I'm not
just someone.

27:22.675 --> 27:25.876
I'm ncis, agent anthony dinozzo.

27:25.878 --> 27:28.178
What's going on?
I don't know.

27:30.181 --> 27:32.216
Please, stop...

27:35.887 --> 27:37.254
Get back here!

27:46.031 --> 27:48.165
(grunting, yelling)

27:49.100 --> 27:52.202
(grunting)

27:52.204 --> 27:54.705
(loud groaning)

27:54.707 --> 27:57.141
(panting)

27:57.143 --> 27:58.942
Did I hear you
say, "please stop?"

27:58.944 --> 28:01.145
(panting)

28:03.948 --> 28:05.949
Come on.

28:05.951 --> 28:08.018
Come on, come on, come on.

28:12.424 --> 28:15.192
You have a minute?
Um...

28:15.194 --> 28:18.996
Sure, but I was just going
down to the garage

28:18.998 --> 28:20.297
Because the dead
rose slasher evidence

28:20.299 --> 28:21.732
Just came in from metro.

28:21.734 --> 28:22.900
I'll ride down with you.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.268
We can talk
along the way.

28:24.270 --> 28:27.371
Okay. Um...

28:27.373 --> 28:28.939
Did I do something wrong?

28:28.941 --> 28:30.374
No. Quite the contrary.

28:30.376 --> 28:33.010
I need your help.

28:35.980 --> 28:38.916
Look, I know you're busy,
but, uh, when you have time,

28:38.918 --> 28:40.751
I'd like to ask a favor.

28:40.753 --> 28:42.753
Oh, sure.

28:42.755 --> 28:44.922
I mean, anything. What?

28:44.924 --> 28:47.157
Kayla needs help
with her science project.

28:47.159 --> 28:48.459
It is not my
strong suit.

28:48.461 --> 28:49.993
Science project?

28:49.995 --> 28:51.161
Yes.

28:51.163 --> 28:53.130
It's only, like,
my favorite thing.

28:53.132 --> 28:55.165
Totally got me
through middle school.

28:55.167 --> 28:58.368
I... I would love to.
I can't wait.

28:58.370 --> 29:01.939
Thank you. Would you, uh, do
me a favor and make sure that

29:01.941 --> 29:04.208
Kayla does some
of the work?
Got it.

29:04.210 --> 29:06.410
How, um...?

29:06.412 --> 29:08.412
How is she?

29:08.414 --> 29:10.481
She's okay.

29:10.483 --> 29:13.350
I, uh... I think
she could benefit

29:13.352 --> 29:16.286
From having a strong adult
woman in her life right now.

29:16.288 --> 29:19.189
Director vance?
Mm?

29:20.892 --> 29:23.093
Would you mind
if I gave you a hug?

29:23.095 --> 29:25.829
I wouldn't mind at all.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.467
Hey!

29:30.469 --> 29:31.235
Abbs!

29:31.237 --> 29:34.471
Great us finally getting
to work together, huh?

29:34.473 --> 29:36.540
I know! Director vance,

29:36.542 --> 29:39.877
This is metro pd's forensics'
specialist, ramsey boone.

29:39.879 --> 29:41.779
Ah.
Ah, director vance.

29:41.781 --> 29:44.148
Wow. Must be a pretty
friendly agency.

29:44.150 --> 29:45.949
You get to hug the boss, huh?

29:45.951 --> 29:48.519
Uh-uh.
Special circumstances.

29:48.521 --> 29:50.454
Glad to meet you, ramsey.

29:50.456 --> 29:52.990
Ramsey and I go way back.

29:52.992 --> 29:54.358
Yeah, we met at
criminal college.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.160
We were roommates.
Junior and senior year.

29:56.162 --> 29:57.494
And he graduated
summa cum laude.

29:57.496 --> 29:59.930
Right, just behind abby,
who was first in her class.

29:59.932 --> 30:01.865
I got it.
Ramsey, thanks for

30:01.867 --> 30:03.400
Your help on this,
but I got to get going.

30:03.402 --> 30:05.469
I got kids to feed.

30:10.008 --> 30:12.009
(sighs)

30:12.011 --> 30:15.145
Looks like we got a lot
of evidence to get through, huh?

30:15.147 --> 30:16.480
Yeah.

30:18.383 --> 30:19.883
Both:
All-nighter!

30:19.885 --> 30:21.351
Ha!

30:21.353 --> 30:24.354
Mcgee: <i>Cameron dean's buddy</i>
<i>in bahrain</i>

30:24.356 --> 30:27.391
He did ask dean to
check up on his wife.

30:27.393 --> 30:29.459
Good. And I just spoke
to the construction company.

30:29.461 --> 30:32.296
Cameron dean's name was on
the wait list yesterday morning.

30:32.298 --> 30:34.231
Sounds like he's
in the clear.
Mm-hmm.

30:36.401 --> 30:39.069
Uh, they're back.
Tony:
Hey, hey.

30:39.071 --> 30:41.572
The double d's-- dinozzo
and dorneget-- got their man.

30:41.574 --> 30:42.506
When do I get my lawyer?

30:42.508 --> 30:44.374
Relax, big guy.

30:44.376 --> 30:45.342
Ned.

30:45.344 --> 30:46.844
What happened?

30:46.846 --> 30:49.079
Oh, um, nothing...

30:49.081 --> 30:50.447
Tony: He got punched
in the head.

30:50.449 --> 30:51.515
Rookie mistake.

30:51.517 --> 30:52.382
Take him
to lockup, dorney.

30:52.384 --> 30:53.517
Okay, come on.

30:53.519 --> 30:54.551
(chuckles)

30:54.553 --> 30:56.520
So, where's
the stripper?

30:56.522 --> 30:58.188
Detained by bahamian
authorities,

30:58.190 --> 30:59.289
Awaiting extradition.

30:59.291 --> 31:00.390
Did you recover the money?

31:00.392 --> 31:04.428
Most of it,
and I got this for you.

31:04.430 --> 31:06.463
(whispering):
Extra small.

31:06.465 --> 31:10.167
It's good to be back.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.977
Oh, hi.

31:19.979 --> 31:21.378
You must be gibbs, yeah.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.247
Abby described
your haircut, like, perfectly.

31:23.249 --> 31:25.148
Uh, she sounded excited
on the phone.

31:25.150 --> 31:26.950
Yeah.
Abby!

31:26.952 --> 31:28.318
Where is she?

31:28.320 --> 31:29.519
Uh...

31:29.521 --> 31:30.454
Abby:
She...

31:30.456 --> 31:31.955
Was brushing her teeth.

31:31.957 --> 31:33.557
(laughs) wow.

31:33.559 --> 31:36.560
Can a body really absorb
any more caffeine?

31:36.562 --> 31:37.995
What have you got?

31:37.997 --> 31:39.997
Mm... (sucking liquid)

31:39.999 --> 31:42.366
Well, the gibbs'
gut was right.

31:42.368 --> 31:43.667
Detective shard was not
sharing everything.

31:43.669 --> 31:45.335
You'll love this.
It's really creepy.

31:45.337 --> 31:49.039
The slasher left a
plain, silver wedding band

31:49.041 --> 31:51.141
Hidden in the mouths
of each one of his victims.

31:51.143 --> 31:54.678
There was doc hubbard, the
medical examiner who found them.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.481
And detective shard, who was
in charge of the investigation.

31:57.483 --> 32:00.017
And me.
Ramsey was sworn
to secrecy, but...

32:00.019 --> 32:02.452
Yeah, but the chief told me
to share everything with you.

32:02.454 --> 32:04.087
Now, the rings
are the reason

32:04.089 --> 32:05.489
That we know
that the recent murders

32:05.491 --> 32:06.657
And the ones
from three years ago

32:06.659 --> 32:08.258
Were committed by
the same person.

32:08.260 --> 32:09.559
That's it?

32:09.561 --> 32:10.994
No.

32:10.996 --> 32:13.196
Well, we also found
the killer's dna.

32:13.198 --> 32:14.431
Where'd you get it?

32:14.433 --> 32:17.167
No, not me-- no, abby found it.
She's a genius.

32:17.169 --> 32:20.003
Oh, no, no, it was absolutely
teamwork-- we did it together.

32:20.005 --> 32:23.540
I never found anything.
Yeah, you would have.
I mean, I just got lucky...

32:23.542 --> 32:25.542
Where'd you get it?!

32:25.544 --> 32:28.378
Oh, um, well, I found
a teensy weensy bit

32:28.380 --> 32:32.015
Of blood on the thorn from the
rose left on victim number two.

32:32.017 --> 32:33.450
Yeah, the killer must have
pricked his finger.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.552
I don't know.
How did I miss it?

32:35.554 --> 32:38.055
The great news is-- it is
not cameron dean's blood.

32:38.057 --> 32:39.556
Whose is it?

32:39.558 --> 32:41.658
Well, we ran the dna.
And we got a hit.

32:43.628 --> 32:46.964
Meet leo winkler.

32:46.966 --> 32:48.498
Yeah, he looks like the sketch.

32:48.500 --> 32:49.700
It's a dead ringer.

32:49.702 --> 32:51.535
Yeah, but don't get
too excited, gibbs,

32:51.537 --> 32:56.740
Like, <i>dead</i> ringer, like,
really, really dead ringer.

32:56.742 --> 32:59.176
(chuckling)

32:59.178 --> 33:00.644
Yeah, winkler died

33:00.646 --> 33:02.679
Shortly after the killings
stopped three years ago.

33:02.681 --> 33:06.083
So, he didn't commit the
most recent murders. Who did?

33:06.085 --> 33:08.151
Copycat.
Copycat.

33:17.295 --> 33:20.163
Let me get this straight:
While dorney and I were away,

33:20.165 --> 33:23.033
You guys got involved in
the dead rose slasher case?

33:23.035 --> 33:24.468
Yup.
Dorneget:
No way!

33:24.470 --> 33:27.104
I dvr'd all
the local news coverage

33:27.106 --> 33:28.772
While we were gone,
so I could keep up.

33:28.774 --> 33:30.440
Well, we solved
the first three murders.

33:30.442 --> 33:32.542
Ziva:
Abby and her boyfriend did.

33:32.544 --> 33:34.177
Ramsey is not her boyfriend.

33:34.179 --> 33:35.245
Who's ramsey?

33:35.247 --> 33:37.347
The killer's name
was leo winkler.

33:37.349 --> 33:39.449
He died in a bar fight
three years ago.

33:39.451 --> 33:41.051
He's a very tragic
character.

33:41.053 --> 33:43.687
Medical records reveal
mr. Winkler was born

33:43.689 --> 33:47.290
To a drug-addicted woman
whose name, curiously, was rose,

33:47.292 --> 33:49.326
The flower he
symbolically left

33:49.328 --> 33:51.461
On each young
lady's corpse.

33:51.463 --> 33:54.564
I mean, he was killing women
like his unwed mother

33:54.566 --> 33:57.567
To prevent them from
having children like himself.

33:57.569 --> 33:59.102
But if he died three years ago,

33:59.104 --> 34:00.137
Who's committing
the recent murders?

34:00.139 --> 34:01.138
Mcgee:
The copycat.

34:01.140 --> 34:02.406
Who could not be cameron dean.

34:02.408 --> 34:04.207
Who's cameron dean?

34:04.209 --> 34:05.409
Gibbs' barber's kid.

34:05.411 --> 34:07.477
Gibbs' barber?
Ziva:
Thank god.

34:07.479 --> 34:10.313
His only crime was looking
like the sketch

34:10.315 --> 34:13.717
There's no way he could've
known about the wedding bands.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.519
Are you following any of this?

34:15.521 --> 34:17.287
Almost...
Shh.

34:17.289 --> 34:18.355
On second thought,
why don't you

34:18.357 --> 34:20.223
Just go back
to the evidence locker?

34:21.793 --> 34:23.060
Thank you.

34:24.429 --> 34:26.730
I love that kid.

34:26.732 --> 34:28.765
Want a ride?

34:28.767 --> 34:30.667
No. What I want to know is

34:30.669 --> 34:32.736
Why I was being suspected
and followed.

34:32.738 --> 34:35.539
Someone thought you looked
like the police sketch.

34:35.541 --> 34:37.207
Who?

34:39.544 --> 34:41.611
Cameron.

34:44.115 --> 34:46.483
You thought
I was the serial killer?

34:46.485 --> 34:48.552
In my heart, I knew
you weren't, son.

34:48.554 --> 34:51.421
You know what?
I'm gonna take the stairs.

34:51.423 --> 34:53.390
Cameron...

34:56.094 --> 34:58.095
Gibbs:
Cameron...

34:58.097 --> 35:00.097
Cameron, wait up.

35:00.099 --> 35:03.166
Look, put yourself
in his place, all right?

35:03.168 --> 35:05.402
There are a bunch
of things from your past.

35:05.404 --> 35:07.571
And then he sees the sketch.

35:07.573 --> 35:09.506
My father's never believed me.

35:09.508 --> 35:11.575
He has no idea who I am.

35:14.445 --> 35:16.513
Don't cut him out of your life.

35:16.515 --> 35:18.748
You only get one father.

35:23.454 --> 35:25.789
Talk to him.

35:30.862 --> 35:32.629
The fact
the killer hid wedding bands

35:32.631 --> 35:35.298
In each of the victim's mouth
was kept a secret.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.534
We used it to discredit
false confessions.

35:37.536 --> 35:39.803
And you never
considered a copycat?

35:39.805 --> 35:41.338
(sighs)

35:41.340 --> 35:42.906
No.

35:42.908 --> 35:45.475
So only you, your m.E.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.911
And a forensic scientist
knew about the wedding band?

35:47.913 --> 35:51.448
Look, tom hubbard is nearly
80 years old and frail.

35:51.450 --> 35:53.650
Trust me, he is not
your slasher.

35:53.652 --> 35:57.220
And ramsey boone,
our forensic tech? Weird.

35:57.222 --> 35:59.456
But I seriously doubt he has it
in him to harm anybody.

35:59.458 --> 36:01.458
That leaves me.

36:01.460 --> 36:02.826
I'll take a polygraph right now.

36:02.828 --> 36:04.327
No one else had access?

36:04.329 --> 36:05.729
No.

36:05.731 --> 36:08.565
And the information wasn't
on any electronic database?

36:08.567 --> 36:10.400
No--

36:10.402 --> 36:12.469
(sighs)

36:12.471 --> 36:14.671
What?

36:14.673 --> 36:16.606
I, uh...

36:16.608 --> 36:18.275
I gave a redacted summary

36:18.277 --> 36:20.443
To a tv reporter.
Who?

36:20.445 --> 36:21.478
Bart crowley.

36:21.480 --> 36:22.612
Why?

36:22.614 --> 36:24.481
The case had gone cold

36:24.483 --> 36:27.217
And-and crowley approached me
about doing a news segment.

36:27.219 --> 36:28.919
He'd been on this story
since the beginning.

36:28.921 --> 36:31.888
Hell, he's the one who coined
the name the dead rose slasher.

36:31.890 --> 36:33.890
I figured we'd get
that sketch out there

36:33.892 --> 36:35.225
And reboot the investigation.

36:35.227 --> 36:37.627
You got a copy of
what you gave him?

36:37.629 --> 36:39.596
Yeah... Somewhere.

36:39.598 --> 36:40.897
Shard blacked-out

36:40.899 --> 36:43.500
15 mentions of the
wedding band, but...

36:43.502 --> 36:45.402
He missed one reference.

36:45.404 --> 36:46.870
Crowley could have found it.

36:46.872 --> 36:49.606
In the three-year period
the serial killings stopped,

36:49.608 --> 36:50.774
Crowley's career suffered.

36:50.776 --> 36:52.542
He never got another
major story.

36:52.544 --> 36:53.944
Rumor is,
he was going to be let go.

36:53.946 --> 36:55.478
Then the dead rose
slasher returns,

36:55.480 --> 36:57.247
And he's back with the
lead story on the news.

36:57.249 --> 36:59.549
You think he became the copycat
to resurrect his career?

36:59.551 --> 37:01.618
You find out where
crowley is now,

37:01.620 --> 37:02.953
And where he was
yesterday morning.

37:02.955 --> 37:04.421
Mm-hmm.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.725
I talked to
kayla last night.

37:08.727 --> 37:11.328
She's chosen a project
about the effects

37:11.330 --> 37:13.430
Of global warming in
the chesapeake bay.

37:13.432 --> 37:14.798
I really appreciate this.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.434
And I have already
pulled temperature

37:17.436 --> 37:19.502
And tide charts for
a 30-year period.

37:20.972 --> 37:22.706
How's the eye, dorneget?

37:22.708 --> 37:24.808
Uh, it-it's fine, sir.

37:24.810 --> 37:27.777
Why are you highlighting
those old manuals?

37:27.779 --> 37:30.413
I'm preparing
for my gs-11 exam.

37:30.415 --> 37:33.516
We haven't given that test
in over 20 years.

37:33.518 --> 37:35.652
But I heard
you were reinstating it.

37:35.654 --> 37:37.721
From whom?

37:37.723 --> 37:40.657
Agent dinozzo.

37:40.659 --> 37:43.393
Dorneget, you're being probied.

37:43.395 --> 37:44.527
Yeah, but ziva confirmed it.

37:44.529 --> 37:48.398
He did the same thing
to her, and she studied

37:48.400 --> 37:49.699
For three months.

37:49.701 --> 37:51.434
Dorneget,

37:51.436 --> 37:54.471
Let's teach agent dinozzo
a lesson.

38:00.678 --> 38:01.978
Look at what I found.

38:01.980 --> 38:03.413
Where's dinozzo?

38:03.415 --> 38:04.581
This was taken an hour before

38:04.583 --> 38:06.783
The last victim's body
was found.

38:06.785 --> 38:08.752
And this is bart crowley's car.

38:08.754 --> 38:10.287
It was parked two blocks away

38:10.289 --> 38:13.523
Mcgee:
While ziva was reviewing
security camera

38:13.525 --> 38:15.859
Footage in the neighborhood,
I tracked crowley's cell phone.

38:15.861 --> 38:17.661
It was turned off
at 4:23 a.M.,

38:17.663 --> 38:19.763
And back on at 5:30.

38:19.765 --> 38:21.298
You suspect crowley?
Yes.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.832
Matches estimated
time of death.

38:22.834 --> 38:25.602
The schmuck should have left
his cell at home, turned on.

38:25.604 --> 38:27.404
You got enough
for search warrants?

38:27.406 --> 38:29.673
Uh...

38:29.675 --> 38:32.842
If it means anything, bart
crowley is left-handed.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.615
I watched all of his
reports last night.

38:38.617 --> 38:40.583
He holds the microphone
with his left

38:40.585 --> 38:42.819
And wears a watch
on the right.

38:44.989 --> 38:47.057
Okay. Thank you, guys.

38:59.870 --> 39:02.339
Police have identified
the latest slasher victim

39:02.341 --> 39:05.475
As a jessica ann jackson,
a 26-year-old waitress.

39:05.477 --> 39:07.744
Family members
I spoke with said

39:07.746 --> 39:08.978
They'd lost contact
with jessica

39:08.980 --> 39:10.780
In the last couple years.

39:10.782 --> 39:12.782
Neighbors I... I spoke with...

39:12.784 --> 39:14.784
Uh...

39:14.786 --> 39:17.620
Um, hold-hold it
for a second, chris.

39:20.624 --> 39:22.425
What's up?

39:22.427 --> 39:24.761
We got a break in
the case, bart.
Hey.

39:24.763 --> 39:27.063
Great.
Thanks to ncis.

39:27.065 --> 39:29.866
We got dna that ties a suspect
to victim number two.

39:29.868 --> 39:32.402
You make an arrest?
No. No.

39:32.404 --> 39:34.037
Can't do that.
That guy died three years ago.

39:34.039 --> 39:36.005
H-how do you explain
all the recent killings?

39:36.007 --> 39:37.407
Copycat.

39:37.409 --> 39:39.476
Huh.

39:39.478 --> 39:40.643
I didn't see that coming.

39:40.645 --> 39:42.746
We got a pretty good
idea who it might be.

39:42.748 --> 39:45.115
A search warrant
on the apartment.

39:45.117 --> 39:47.650
Found a few
interesting items

39:47.652 --> 39:49.386
In the bedroom drawer.

39:49.388 --> 39:53.890
Two dead, long-stemmed roses,
several silver wedding bands,

39:53.892 --> 39:57.127
And the coup de grace--
a six-inch knife.

39:57.129 --> 40:01.598
I'm betting we find traces of
the victims' blood on the blade.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.066
Hmm.

40:03.068 --> 40:05.402
And your camera crew's
been shooting all this.

40:05.404 --> 40:06.970
Why don't you turn around?

40:06.972 --> 40:09.773
Come on, turn around.

40:09.775 --> 40:12.609
Your arrest is gonna make
excellent footage

40:12.611 --> 40:14.677
On tonight's news.

40:19.784 --> 40:21.651
Morning, timmy.

40:21.653 --> 40:23.453
Dorney, did you get
a little hall pass

40:23.455 --> 40:24.854
To come play with the grownups?

40:24.856 --> 40:26.122
Look at you.

40:26.124 --> 40:29.125
All grown up, wearing a suit.

40:29.127 --> 40:31.060
(sighs)
what have we here?

40:31.062 --> 40:32.495
No idea.

40:32.497 --> 40:33.663
(sniffing)

40:33.665 --> 40:34.964
Red envelope.

40:34.966 --> 40:36.866
Oh, it's just my expense report.

40:36.868 --> 40:38.902
I just handed this in.

40:38.904 --> 40:40.770
The bahamas-- we had
some fun down there.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.572
Didn't we? Look at that.
A little note signed

40:42.574 --> 40:44.808
By the director.
What's he saying?

40:44.810 --> 40:47.510
It's been rejected?

40:47.512 --> 40:49.879
I'm being audited for
the past two years?

40:49.881 --> 40:51.881
What is this?

40:51.883 --> 40:53.883
Oh. That's too bad.

40:53.885 --> 40:56.886
No!

No, no, no!
