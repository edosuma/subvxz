ALEX:
                Yeah. All right.

01:17.276 --> 01:18.977
Well, bye-bye, everybody.

01:19.044 --> 01:20.445
Huh?

01:20.513 --> 01:22.914
I'm going to meet Simka at
   the Department of Immigration

01:22.982 --> 01:25.917
so she can get her green card
    and stay in America forever.

01:25.984 --> 01:28.219
Oh... yeah!
ALEX:
Hey, Latka, Latka,
that's great.

01:28.287 --> 01:29.887
That's great.
                          LATKA:
             We'll have a party,

01:29.955 --> 01:31.122
and you're
                    all invited.

01:31.189 --> 01:32.890
Oh.
JIM:
Uh, excuse me?

01:32.958 --> 01:34.892
Are you serving

01:34.960 --> 01:37.529
barbecued yak lips again?

01:39.064 --> 01:42.300
I-I wasn't planning on it,

01:42.367 --> 01:45.836
but, uh, if you want, okay,
    we'll serve it just for you.

01:45.904 --> 01:47.339
(mumbling)

01:47.406 --> 01:50.442
Latka, wait, Latka, Latka,
listen, I got a great idea.

01:50.509 --> 01:53.845
And, uh, believe me, this is not
a comment on how you entertain.

01:53.913 --> 01:55.346
Uh, just to save you
the trouble,

01:55.414 --> 01:57.081
why don't you let us
handle the party?

01:57.149 --> 01:58.082
Yeah.

01:58.150 --> 01:59.584
Yeah.

01:59.652 --> 02:02.554
You know, this-this feels
         like this is a nice way

02:02.621 --> 02:06.223
of you saying
    that our parties stink.

02:06.291 --> 02:07.559
A very nice way.

02:07.626 --> 02:09.259
Tony, Tony, will you?

02:09.328 --> 02:13.031
Okay, well, in that case,
     we'll be home at 6:30.

02:13.099 --> 02:14.766
Okay, we'll
                          do it.
    Okay, all right,
    all right.

02:14.834 --> 02:16.734
Hey, Latka, how are we gonna get
       in your apartment?

02:16.802 --> 02:19.470
Open the door and walk in.

02:19.538 --> 02:20.805
Oh, what are you
talking about?

02:20.872 --> 02:22.140
Latka, don't you
lock your door?

02:22.208 --> 02:24.809
Why? This is America.

02:24.876 --> 02:26.277
ALEX:
Oh, no.

02:26.345 --> 02:28.313
Latka, I mean, this-this
              is a great country

02:28.381 --> 02:30.348
in a lot of respects,
                   but you know,

02:30.415 --> 02:32.884
there are still some vile,
           horrid people around.

02:32.952 --> 02:35.053
Oh, that reminds me.

02:35.121 --> 02:37.988
Uh, Louie?

02:38.056 --> 02:40.591
Thanks for thinking of me.

02:52.537 --> 02:53.638
Hey, look at this!

02:53.706 --> 02:54.805
Look at this.

02:54.873 --> 02:56.474
Well, what
                    do you know?
    Ooh!

02:56.541 --> 02:58.175
Did you do all this?
Hey, Jim!

02:58.243 --> 03:00.077
Yup. Pretty snazzy, huh?

03:00.145 --> 03:01.780
ELAINE:
You got it.

03:01.847 --> 03:07.352
I wanted Simka's party
   to have a patriotic motif.

03:07.420 --> 03:08.987
Where'd you get all this stuff?

03:09.055 --> 03:11.589
Democratic Convention, 1968.

03:14.193 --> 03:16.227
Did I ever tell
                you I was there?

03:16.295 --> 03:17.495
ELAINE:
Uh-huh.

03:17.563 --> 03:20.098
Yes, you did. In fact,
you told us you got arrested.

03:20.166 --> 03:22.200
Yup, for stealing
                    decorations.

03:24.269 --> 03:26.036
They never would have caught me,

03:26.104 --> 03:28.439
except I went back
      for one other item.

03:28.507 --> 03:30.007
What was that?

03:30.075 --> 03:32.109
John Chancellor's tie.

03:33.845 --> 03:36.547
(Simka and Latka arguing loudly
   in their native language)

03:36.615 --> 03:37.815
(loud thud on door)

03:37.883 --> 03:39.383
(shouting)

03:42.688 --> 03:44.389
Hi!

03:44.457 --> 03:46.291
Gee,

03:46.359 --> 03:48.559
what is this?

03:48.627 --> 03:52.463
It looks likes
  Uncle Sam exploded in here.

03:52.531 --> 03:54.799
Yeah.

03:54.867 --> 03:57.135
They thought you were going
to get your green card,

03:57.203 --> 03:59.003
and they wanted
to give you a party.

03:59.071 --> 04:00.171
TONY:
Yeah.

04:00.239 --> 04:03.407
Oh! What a great
                       surprise!

04:03.475 --> 04:06.578
You have such
                   nice friends.

04:06.646 --> 04:08.580
Gee,

04:08.647 --> 04:11.682
it's such a pleasure
    to have you in my home,

04:11.750 --> 04:13.952
and I hope
    you have a great party.

04:14.020 --> 04:15.954
(voice breaking):
     All right? Good night.

04:19.892 --> 04:23.027
That was a
                  lovely speech.

04:24.563 --> 04:26.264
Huh?

04:26.331 --> 04:29.967
Oh, Latka, didn't-didn't Simka
get her green card?

04:30.035 --> 04:31.569
No, no, but

04:31.636 --> 04:32.871
that doesn't matter.
            It's-It's all right.

04:32.938 --> 04:34.105
Listen, let's
                  have some fun.

04:34.173 --> 04:35.773
Now, who's up for
         bobbing for fish parts?

04:35.841 --> 04:36.941
ALEX:
                  Wait a minute.

04:37.009 --> 04:38.943
Wait a minute, Latka.

04:40.612 --> 04:42.880
Simka didn't get
                 her green card?

04:42.948 --> 04:44.949
Was there some
                kind of problem?

04:45.017 --> 04:46.417
No, is no problem.

04:46.485 --> 04:48.252
She just didn't go
inside the building.

04:48.320 --> 04:49.987
But that-that doesn't matter.

04:50.055 --> 04:53.024
Here, uh, Jim,
     you fill up the sink.

04:53.092 --> 04:55.926
Uh, Elaine, open up this can
       of flounder faces.

04:55.994 --> 04:57.995
Alex, hold your nose
        and count to 20.

04:58.063 --> 04:59.363
Yeah, wait
                       a minute.

04:59.431 --> 05:01.031
SIMKA:
                             Ha!

05:01.099 --> 05:03.668
LATKA:
Uh-oh.

05:03.735 --> 05:05.336
Hi, everybody.

05:05.404 --> 05:07.071
How is the party going?

05:07.139 --> 05:08.639
Is everybody having a good time?

05:08.707 --> 05:10.608
Now, if there is anything
         that you want,

05:10.675 --> 05:12.176
don't hesitate to ask for it.

05:12.244 --> 05:13.478
Don't mind me.

05:13.546 --> 05:16.781
I just had a craving
  for a little salt, you know?

05:16.849 --> 05:18.783
Uh, Latka,
                close the drape.

05:22.354 --> 05:25.923
Okay, now, uh,
    who wants to bob first?

05:25.991 --> 05:27.491
Me!

05:27.559 --> 05:30.628
But I've got to warn you,
 I've done this professionally.

05:30.696 --> 05:31.863
Latka?

05:31.930 --> 05:33.898
Latka, I-I don't want
to butt in,

05:33.966 --> 05:36.133
but, uh, she wouldn't go
into the office,

05:36.201 --> 05:38.269
and she's acting
very peculiar.

05:38.336 --> 05:41.272
You don't miss
                a thing, do you?

05:41.340 --> 05:43.241
Listen, it's no
                cause for alarm.

05:43.309 --> 05:45.243
She gets this way
                   once a month.

05:45.311 --> 05:46.010
Oh.

05:46.078 --> 05:47.178
Oh.

05:47.246 --> 05:48.479
Oh.

05:53.618 --> 05:56.755
Are we supposed
to have realized something here?

05:56.822 --> 05:57.922
Okay, Jim?

05:57.990 --> 05:59.090
Huh?

05:59.157 --> 06:02.760
Simka's having her,
            uh, monthly problem.

06:02.828 --> 06:05.196
Bills, bills, bills.

06:12.671 --> 06:14.172
Well, who is winning?

06:14.239 --> 06:15.339
I am.

06:15.407 --> 06:16.507
Hey, Latka,
    what are you doing here?

06:16.575 --> 06:17.842
I thought you had that,
      uh, big appointment

06:17.909 --> 06:19.009
at the Immigration Office.

06:19.077 --> 06:20.378
That's right.

06:20.446 --> 06:21.579
What's the hurry?

06:21.647 --> 06:23.681
This is the third interview
        we've lined up,

06:23.749 --> 06:25.516
and Simka has yet to show up.

06:25.584 --> 06:26.951
She's going to be deported,

06:27.018 --> 06:29.520
and my life's going
     to be a barren desert.

06:29.588 --> 06:30.988
(sighs)

06:31.056 --> 06:32.957
Why did these interviews
         have to happen

06:33.025 --> 06:35.693
while she's having
       her <i>crimpka poosh?</i>

06:38.430 --> 06:39.997
Well, Latka,

06:40.065 --> 06:41.465
maybe if you
                 explain to them

06:41.533 --> 06:42.767
that she wasn't
              feeling very well,

06:42.835 --> 06:44.702
they-they'd postpone it
           for a couple of days.

06:44.770 --> 06:45.870
Couple of days?

06:45.938 --> 06:47.037
Yeah.

06:47.105 --> 06:49.273
It's going to be
more like two weeks.

06:49.341 --> 06:52.743
Oh, no, no, Latka, I'm
           sure you're mistaken.

06:52.811 --> 06:54.745
No, Simka's...

06:56.581 --> 06:57.949
A woman's...

06:59.718 --> 07:01.653
Well...

07:01.720 --> 07:04.355
Well, my...
                <i>crimpka poosh...</i>

07:04.423 --> 07:06.056
(laughs)

07:06.124 --> 07:08.827
...lasts four days tops.

07:08.894 --> 07:11.261
Elaine,

07:11.329 --> 07:14.666
you don't have <i>crimpka poosh.</i>

07:16.935 --> 07:19.069
Latka,

07:19.137 --> 07:23.407
I don't want to argue
      the point, but I do.

07:23.475 --> 07:26.009
No, you don't.

07:26.077 --> 07:27.645
Yes, I do!

07:27.713 --> 07:28.880
You don't.

07:28.947 --> 07:32.817
Latka, I have <i>crimpka poosh,</i>

07:32.885 --> 07:37.555
and I have been <i>crimpka pooshing</i>
         since I was 12.

07:39.057 --> 07:41.125
Elaine, you don't
      by any chance think

07:41.192 --> 07:43.928
I'm talking
   about your period, do you?

07:48.466 --> 07:50.468
Well, I did.

07:50.535 --> 07:54.038
But maybe because
I love talking about it so much.

07:55.140 --> 07:56.607
Now, wait a minute, wait.

07:56.675 --> 07:59.110
If that's not it, then-then what
  is it you're talking about?

07:59.177 --> 08:00.611
TONY:
Yeah, what is it?
                           Yeah.

08:00.679 --> 08:02.914
Well, I'm talking
about the two weeks every month

08:02.982 --> 08:05.316
when Simka becomes
like another person.

08:05.383 --> 08:10.955
Is, uh... she,
 by any chance, clumsy, Latka?

08:11.022 --> 08:13.157
Yes. How did you know?

08:13.225 --> 08:15.727
And she craves salt?

08:15.794 --> 08:16.961
Yes.

08:17.029 --> 08:19.831
As a matter of fact,
   she puts it in the coffee.

08:19.899 --> 08:21.266
Hey, it tastes terrible.

08:21.333 --> 08:22.767
Uh-huh.

08:22.834 --> 08:24.936
Uh, does she have...

08:25.003 --> 08:26.571
headaches?

08:26.638 --> 08:28.740
Talking jags?

08:28.807 --> 08:30.808
Crying jags? Depressions?

08:30.875 --> 08:32.110
Yes.

08:32.177 --> 08:33.410
(clears throat)

08:33.477 --> 08:39.984
Latka, I'm no scientist
     or medical authority.

08:40.052 --> 08:42.119
I'm just an average Joe.

08:44.956 --> 08:49.060
But in my opinion,
         Simka suffers

08:49.128 --> 08:51.428
from premenstrual syndrome.

08:51.496 --> 08:53.697
Oh, really?
                   You think so?

08:53.765 --> 08:54.866
That's terrible.

08:54.933 --> 08:56.167
Yes.

08:56.234 --> 08:58.870
I read about it
in the <i>Harvard Medical Journal.</i>

09:01.940 --> 09:04.208
Or was it on a box
of Cocoa Puffs?

09:06.611 --> 09:07.912
Huh?

09:07.980 --> 09:10.013
Jim, please tell me
                more about this.

09:10.081 --> 09:12.683
Simply stated,

09:12.751 --> 09:17.721
throughout Simka's
monthly cycle,

09:17.789 --> 09:22.427
hormonal changes occur which...

09:22.494 --> 09:24.028
(phone ringing)

09:24.096 --> 09:26.063
I'll get it.

09:26.131 --> 09:28.332
Hey! Hey, wait
                       a minute!

09:28.400 --> 09:29.533
Where are you going?

09:29.601 --> 09:30.801
Come back here, you.

09:30.869 --> 09:32.036
ELAINE:
                          Latka?
         Wait a minute!

09:32.104 --> 09:33.705
Latka, I know what
           Jim is talking about,

09:33.772 --> 09:35.106
and I think he's
                   right. I-I...

09:35.173 --> 09:36.607
Just... It sounds
                     like, uh...

09:36.675 --> 09:38.843
It sounds like Simka's suffering
     from premenstrual syndrome.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.010
But don't worry about it.

09:40.078 --> 09:41.479
I had a friend
                     who had it.

09:41.546 --> 09:43.380
She went to her doctor.
           He gave her vitamins.

09:43.448 --> 09:45.682
He changed her diet and-and
    it really made a difference.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.317
How long did it take?

09:47.385 --> 09:49.386
About two months.
Well, I only

09:49.454 --> 09:51.288
have six minutes
before this interview.

09:51.356 --> 09:53.724
It's the last chance
before Simka gets deported.

09:53.792 --> 09:55.860
Hey, Latka, Latka, excuse
          me, but, uh, sometimes

09:55.928 --> 09:58.863
when, uh, someone knows,
           uh, what they've got,

09:58.930 --> 10:01.766
it makes it easier for
           them to deal with it.

10:01.834 --> 10:04.168
Now I'll bet that just before
  you go into that interview,

10:04.235 --> 10:06.170
if you take Simka aside
       and explain to her

10:06.238 --> 10:07.338
just what's wrong with her,

10:07.406 --> 10:08.873
it's gonna help her
        get through it.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.407
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, that sounds
like a good idea.

10:10.475 --> 10:11.942
Yeah.
I'm going to meet her
right now

10:12.010 --> 10:13.677
at the Department of
Immigration, and I'll tell her.

10:13.745 --> 10:14.846
Okay,
                      good luck.
             Okay.

10:14.913 --> 10:16.013
Bye-bye.

10:16.081 --> 10:17.247
TONY:
               Good luck, Latka.

10:17.315 --> 10:18.649
Good luck, baby.
I've got
to go, too, you guys.

10:18.717 --> 10:19.817
I'll see you.

10:19.885 --> 10:21.118
Hey, wait up.
I'll walk you out.

10:21.186 --> 10:22.286
Hey, take it easy, Al.

10:22.353 --> 10:23.521
Okay, see you later.

10:23.589 --> 10:25.089
LOUIE:
                    Boy, Reiger,

10:25.156 --> 10:26.557
I'd hate to be you.

10:26.625 --> 10:28.292
I'd hate to be the one

10:28.360 --> 10:31.596
who ends up having
    to help everybody else.

10:31.663 --> 10:33.797
Geez, what a sap!

10:33.865 --> 10:35.532
It may surprise you, Louie,

10:35.600 --> 10:38.102
but I happen
to enjoy helping people.

10:38.169 --> 10:39.403
And, yes, I will admit,

10:39.470 --> 10:41.138
it gives me
a certain pleasure, yes.

10:41.205 --> 10:42.740
(groans)

10:42.808 --> 10:45.976
JIM:
Poor Latka.

10:46.044 --> 10:49.180
That was Simka on the phone.

10:49.247 --> 10:53.250
She says she's not gonna show up
  for her interview this time.

10:53.318 --> 10:55.553
I tried to persuade her,

10:55.621 --> 10:58.289
but she growled at me.

10:58.356 --> 11:01.292
I guess she's gonna be deported.

11:01.359 --> 11:04.929
She is doomed.

11:07.098 --> 11:10.368
Is there no one
               who can save her?

11:12.137 --> 11:15.673
Is there no one who
               can go over there

11:15.741 --> 11:18.009
and talk some sense

11:18.076 --> 11:20.344
into the poor,
                  demented soul?

11:20.412 --> 11:23.981
Oh, it seems
                    so hopeless.

11:24.048 --> 11:25.216
(gasps)

11:25.284 --> 11:27.785
But wait a minute!

11:34.559 --> 11:38.296
Reiger the
                   Good is here!

11:38.363 --> 11:40.331
He'll save the day

11:40.398 --> 11:43.935
and enjoy
                himself to boot.

11:46.371 --> 11:49.373
Let the good times roll, Reiger!

11:57.149 --> 11:59.417
(knocking on door)
ALEX:
Simka?

11:59.484 --> 12:02.653
(knocking continues)
Simka?!

12:05.223 --> 12:06.223
Simka?

12:06.291 --> 12:08.292
(growling)

12:10.662 --> 12:13.397
Simka, I, uh, I want
to talk to you.

12:13.464 --> 12:17.401
(Simka growling)

12:17.469 --> 12:21.105
Now, look, Simka, if that's
      you, you better stop this.

12:21.172 --> 12:23.240
(yells)

12:23.308 --> 12:26.744
Oh, so, Reiger, what,

12:26.811 --> 12:28.979
you were just
      in the neighborhood

12:29.047 --> 12:33.084
and decided to drop by
  uninvited and scream at me?

12:33.152 --> 12:35.086
No, no, no, no,
                    no, I, uh...

12:35.153 --> 12:37.688
(crunching)
         I was a little startled

12:37.755 --> 12:39.657
when you pulled
              that curtain open.
Mm-hmm.

12:39.724 --> 12:41.959
Look, Simka, I just came here
     to tell you something that,

12:42.027 --> 12:43.594
that's gonna make you
               feel a lot better

12:43.662 --> 12:45.028
so you can go to the interview.

12:46.731 --> 12:50.100
I <i>ain't</i> going to no interview!

12:52.037 --> 12:55.439
(whimpering):
My barbecue chips!

12:59.444 --> 13:01.845
Oh, come on, Simka,
                  you got to go.

13:01.913 --> 13:04.114
If you don't go, you're gonna
      have to leave the country.

13:09.154 --> 13:14.292
I'm going to have to leave
  the country anyway, Reiger.

13:14.359 --> 13:17.628
Because I'm crazy.

13:17.696 --> 13:22.466
I'm a mad woman that
Latka is well rid of.

13:22.534 --> 13:27.537
Dear Lord, help me, I'm wacko!

13:27.605 --> 13:29.706
I'm wacko!

13:29.774 --> 13:31.709
Reiger, I'm wacko.

13:31.776 --> 13:34.078
No, Simka, Simka,
       you are not crazy.

13:34.145 --> 13:36.080
You are not wacko.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.449
You have premenstrual syndrome.

13:42.353 --> 13:45.156
Pre-what syndrome?

13:45.223 --> 13:46.924
Menstrual.

13:49.261 --> 13:52.229
You had just better
        be talking about

13:52.297 --> 13:56.467
little men in blackface
  who play the banjos, buddy.

13:58.704 --> 14:01.004
Because where I come from,

14:01.072 --> 14:03.507
we do not talk about
the other thing

14:03.575 --> 14:05.309
in front of a man.

14:05.376 --> 14:07.812
Oh, come on, Simka,
        this is America!

14:07.879 --> 14:10.281
Oh! Oh, it's America.

14:10.348 --> 14:13.183
Oh, forgive me, I lost my head.

14:13.251 --> 14:15.919
I-I got nothing
     to be ashamed of here.

14:15.987 --> 14:17.588
No, no, sir.

14:17.656 --> 14:22.726
I want all America to know
that I have a menstrual problem.

14:22.794 --> 14:24.094
Maybe we could just

14:24.162 --> 14:28.232
work it in to the half-time
    show at the Super Bowl.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.900
No, no, wait, wait.
      Where are you going?

14:29.968 --> 14:32.436
Oh, I'm just going
         up to the roof

14:32.503 --> 14:35.840
to sing a few bars
   of "I Enjoy Being a Girl"

14:35.908 --> 14:37.675
and then I'm gonna jump.

14:37.743 --> 14:38.709
No, no, no, Simka, Simka,

14:38.776 --> 14:40.043
Simka, please,
              just listen to me,

14:40.111 --> 14:42.112
listen, you're not crazy,
               you're not crazy.

14:42.180 --> 14:44.448
You have premenstrual syndrome.

14:44.516 --> 14:46.684
Simka, it's not your fault.

14:46.752 --> 14:48.185
Now a lot of women have it.

14:48.253 --> 14:49.619
It's not completely understood,

14:49.687 --> 14:51.254
but I'm telling you,
       it can be treated.

14:54.326 --> 14:55.993
You're not just lying to me

14:56.061 --> 14:58.062
to get me to go
  to that interview, are you?

14:58.130 --> 15:00.597
No, no, no, no, I'm
telling you the truth.

15:00.665 --> 15:02.800
Really?

15:02.867 --> 15:04.134
Yes, yes, of course.

15:04.202 --> 15:07.171
Simka, there's nothing
to be ashamed of.

15:07.239 --> 15:10.207
Well then, if there's
       nothing to be ashamed of,

15:10.275 --> 15:13.977
how come it hasn't been
          the movie of the week?

15:14.045 --> 15:16.747
Well, I'm sure it will be.

15:16.815 --> 15:19.717
They'll probably
call it "The Love Bloat."

15:19.784 --> 15:21.251
(laughing)

15:25.724 --> 15:28.159
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15:28.226 --> 15:30.127
What if I go to this interview

15:30.194 --> 15:34.498
and then I get there
   and I say the wrong thing?

15:34.566 --> 15:36.433
Would you please help me, Alex?

15:36.501 --> 15:38.268
Of course, I'll...
                             Oh!

15:38.336 --> 15:40.538
Don't touch me,
                   just help me.
Right.

15:40.605 --> 15:42.573
I won't touch you,
I won't touch you.

15:42.641 --> 15:44.208
Look, Simka, all
I can say to you

15:44.275 --> 15:46.810
is that if you don't go down
to that Immigration office

15:46.877 --> 15:49.379
right now, they're
going to deport you.

15:50.882 --> 15:52.883
And you're gonna
      break Latka's heart

15:52.950 --> 15:55.352
and possibly ruin
      both of your lives.

15:55.420 --> 15:58.989
Now, look, Simka, now
that I think you know

15:59.057 --> 16:02.426
what causes the problem
and that you're not crazy,

16:02.493 --> 16:05.362
that you'll be able to find it
in yourself to get up now

16:05.429 --> 16:08.599
and go down to that interview
      and get through it.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.701
I'm, I'm gonna try.

16:10.769 --> 16:11.935
Good, good.

16:12.003 --> 16:15.005
And, and, and I think
      I could do it, too.

16:15.072 --> 16:16.706
I know you can.
                 I think I could

16:16.774 --> 16:20.811
get myself under control
       and convince them

16:20.879 --> 16:23.947
that I'm a reasonably
   sane and rational person.

16:24.015 --> 16:25.616
Right.

16:25.683 --> 16:29.120
All right, let's go.

16:32.524 --> 16:34.859
Wait, uh, Simka, wait,

16:34.926 --> 16:38.128
uh, what about
            what you're wearing?

16:38.196 --> 16:41.164
Of course.

16:44.102 --> 16:46.170
Do you like this?

16:46.238 --> 16:48.305
Now that is exactly
                what a rational,

16:48.372 --> 16:50.173
sane person would wear.

16:50.241 --> 16:52.743
Good, I'll change on the bus.

16:52.810 --> 16:55.679
No, no, no, no, Simka,
    wait, Simka, wait, wait!

16:58.516 --> 17:00.250
LATKA:
  <i>But I think my favorite part</i>

17:00.318 --> 17:02.319
<i>of America</i>
      <i>is the fruited plain.</i>

17:02.387 --> 17:04.154
Of course the purple
                mountain majesty

17:04.222 --> 17:05.789
is nothing to shake a stick at.

17:05.857 --> 17:07.424
And you know, when
               I hear people say

17:07.492 --> 17:08.825
that they don't like America,

17:08.893 --> 17:11.094
they think it's a troubled
          land on its last legs,

17:11.162 --> 17:14.098
I say, "You should be happy
               to live in a land

17:14.165 --> 17:16.299
"where you have the
           freedom to criticize.

17:16.367 --> 17:18.435
"In my country, you'd
           be covered with jelly

17:18.502 --> 17:20.771
and sent to live
                 among the fat."

17:20.839 --> 17:25.976
Mr. Gravas, please,
       the question was,

17:26.044 --> 17:28.712
"What was your wife's
         maiden name?"

17:28.780 --> 17:31.748
Dahblitz.

17:31.816 --> 17:33.049
But I don't understand

17:33.117 --> 17:35.385
why you're asking me
         these, these questions.

17:35.453 --> 17:36.920
"What is my favorite TV show?"

17:36.988 --> 17:39.189
"What do I have for
        breakfast this morning?"

17:39.257 --> 17:41.559
Why don't you ask me
             why I love America?

17:41.626 --> 17:44.928
I'm asking specific
       personal questions

17:44.996 --> 17:48.231
so I can compare
  your answers to your wife's

17:48.299 --> 17:50.901
to make sure that you
     really live together.

17:50.969 --> 17:52.970
You know, a lot of people
         try to fool us

17:53.038 --> 17:55.238
with a paper marriage so
 they can stay in the country.

17:55.306 --> 17:58.108
Frankly, Mr. Gravas,

17:58.176 --> 18:00.344
since your wife
    hasn't been showing up,

18:00.412 --> 18:02.445
I've become a little
       suspicious of you.

18:02.513 --> 18:04.014
You think you can tell a lot

18:04.082 --> 18:08.652
from asking me these
               stupid questions?

18:08.719 --> 18:10.554
It isn't just the questions.

18:10.622 --> 18:12.723
I also look to see
       how people react.

18:12.791 --> 18:14.758
That's the real giveaway.

18:14.826 --> 18:17.561
If people are very nervous
       and fidgety, well,

18:17.628 --> 18:19.663
I know they're trying
     to put one over on us.

18:19.731 --> 18:22.399
Yeah, well let me tell you
    something about my wife.

18:22.467 --> 18:24.902
She's naturally
      nervous and fidgety.

18:24.969 --> 18:27.170
And matter of fact, one of
   the reasons I married her

18:27.238 --> 18:29.473
is because she's
      nervous and fidgety.

18:29.540 --> 18:30.941
Wait until you see.

18:31.009 --> 18:32.776
It's a real turn-on.

18:32.844 --> 18:35.145
She's one...

18:35.213 --> 18:37.948
She's one hot, fidgety mama.

18:38.015 --> 18:41.518
Yeah, well, if she doesn't
  get here in about a minute,

18:41.585 --> 18:43.887
I'm afraid I'm going
     to have to miss that.

18:43.955 --> 18:46.890
Now, Mr. Gravas,
     the final question is,

18:46.958 --> 18:50.828
"What was the last movie
you and your wife saw together?"

18:50.896 --> 18:54.798
Um, oh, it was
    <i>Officer and a Gentleman.</i>

18:54.866 --> 18:56.300
I remember because I thought

18:56.368 --> 18:58.335
it was going to be
       a double feature.

19:02.607 --> 19:04.307
Well, that was the last question

19:04.375 --> 19:05.975
and she's still not here.

19:06.043 --> 19:08.178
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to terminate her application.

19:08.246 --> 19:09.380
No! No!
I'm sorry.

19:09.447 --> 19:11.015
No, please, no, no,
    but you don't understand

19:11.082 --> 19:13.617
what America means
              to people like us.
I have to get home for dinner.

19:13.684 --> 19:15.418
I love my wife.
           If you send her back,

19:15.486 --> 19:17.955
Yes.
        I have to go too and our
      children won't be able to,

19:18.022 --> 19:20.157
I understand that.
              to grow up in such
            a beautiful country.

19:20.225 --> 19:22.459
Please, understand that.

19:22.527 --> 19:24.461
I take it this
is Mrs. Gravas?

19:24.528 --> 19:26.897
Yes.

19:28.332 --> 19:30.834
Hello, everybody.

19:30.902 --> 19:32.435
Simka, I have to
                    talk to you.

19:32.503 --> 19:34.872
I have some good news
       about your <i>crimpka poosh.</i>

19:34.939 --> 19:36.707
Not now, dear.

19:36.774 --> 19:39.275
Um, hello.

19:39.343 --> 19:41.578
I'm so sorry I'm late.

19:41.646 --> 19:43.947
And I hope I haven't
      inconvenienced you,

19:44.015 --> 19:45.782
Mr. Officer of the Land.

19:45.850 --> 19:47.083
Sit down, will you?

19:47.151 --> 19:48.685
Thank you.

19:48.753 --> 19:51.255
Good.

19:51.322 --> 19:53.290
Now, Mrs. Gravas,

19:53.358 --> 19:54.925
I'm going to ask
a few questions.

19:54.992 --> 19:56.426
Right.

19:56.494 --> 20:00.731
What was the last movie you
 and your husband saw together?

20:03.534 --> 20:08.438
With all due respect, do you
 mind if I ask you a question?

20:08.506 --> 20:09.506
Sure.

20:09.574 --> 20:11.174
What has that got to do

20:11.242 --> 20:13.944
with the price of tea in China?

20:14.012 --> 20:18.181
I'm going to compare your
   answer to your husband's.

20:18.249 --> 20:21.752
Now, what was the last movie
     you two saw together?

20:21.820 --> 20:25.355
Okay, let me think.

20:25.423 --> 20:29.026
Movie.

20:29.094 --> 20:33.663
Movie, movie, movie,
                 movie, movie...

20:35.399 --> 20:37.801
Why am I thinking about movies?

20:37.869 --> 20:40.571
Because I asked you
      what the last movie

20:40.639 --> 20:42.472
you two saw together was.

20:42.540 --> 20:44.274
Oh! Of course!

20:44.341 --> 20:45.776
Of course, wait a minute.

20:45.844 --> 20:47.211
Um...

20:47.278 --> 20:50.981
Ooh, it's just right
    on the top of my tongue.

20:51.049 --> 20:53.783
Oh, let me think,
                    what was it?

20:53.851 --> 20:55.886
What was it? What was
                it? What was it?

20:55.953 --> 20:59.823
See, I told you.
It's a real turn-on.

20:59.891 --> 21:01.691
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

21:01.759 --> 21:05.395
I, I, I got it!

21:05.463 --> 21:09.566
What was the last movie

21:09.634 --> 21:14.004
that Latka and I
                   saw together?

21:14.072 --> 21:16.840
That's the question.

21:16.908 --> 21:18.341
What's the answer?

21:18.409 --> 21:21.078
Oh, of course.

21:21.146 --> 21:22.479
Of course.

21:22.547 --> 21:24.247
No, wait a minute,
            no, no, don't worry,

21:24.315 --> 21:25.816
uh, I can think of it.

21:25.883 --> 21:27.250
I can think of it, don't worry.

21:27.318 --> 21:30.287
Don't worry.

21:30.355 --> 21:33.490
(shrieks) I got it!

21:33.558 --> 21:34.791
I got it.

21:34.859 --> 21:38.061
It was <i>Ghandi.</i>

21:39.698 --> 21:42.699
Oh, she's right.

21:42.767 --> 21:44.468
I'm sorry, I forgot.

21:44.535 --> 21:45.902
I forgot.

21:45.970 --> 21:48.438
I said it was
 <i>Officer and a Gentleman.</i>

21:48.506 --> 21:49.906
But, but don't worry, Simka.

21:49.974 --> 21:52.008
There are still
a few more questions.
                             No!

21:52.076 --> 21:53.777
Excuse me.

21:57.916 --> 22:01.017
What do you mean there are
     still a few more questions?

22:01.085 --> 22:02.686
We already got one wrong

22:02.753 --> 22:05.289
because you can't
             tell the difference

22:05.356 --> 22:08.692
between Richard Gere
               and a bald Hindu.

22:12.029 --> 22:14.498
Now, now, Simka, be calm.

22:14.565 --> 22:16.133
What do you mean, be calm?

22:16.200 --> 22:18.001
You wouldn't be so calm
         if it was you

22:18.069 --> 22:19.369
who was gonna get deported.

22:19.436 --> 22:20.904
Well, if you would
answer the questions,

22:20.971 --> 22:22.206
you won't be deported.

22:22.273 --> 22:24.541
Well, what's the use of
answering the questions

22:24.609 --> 22:26.410
if you got them all wrong?

22:26.478 --> 22:27.677
Now, listen here you...

22:27.745 --> 22:31.682
(arguing in foreign language)

22:31.750 --> 22:33.116
(yelling in foreign language)

22:33.184 --> 22:34.951
Uh, excuse me?

22:35.019 --> 22:36.386
Excuse me!

22:39.590 --> 22:42.893
I don't think there's any point
in going on with this interview.

22:44.996 --> 22:47.230
Oh, no!

22:47.298 --> 22:49.566
Latka, what have I done?

22:49.634 --> 22:51.902
Your green card
  will be in the mail shortly.

22:51.969 --> 22:54.938
Yes, I'm thoroughly
convinced that you two

22:55.005 --> 22:57.908
are legitimately
husband and wife.

23:00.478 --> 23:02.378
Latka!
       Simka!

23:02.446 --> 23:03.580
We did it!
      Oh!

23:03.648 --> 23:06.282
Uh, you can leave now.

23:06.350 --> 23:08.619
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

23:08.686 --> 23:09.819
Uh, wait a minute.

23:09.887 --> 23:11.855
Aren't you gonna give us
               that speech about

23:11.922 --> 23:13.423
"Welcome to America"?

23:13.491 --> 23:14.424
We don't do that.

23:14.492 --> 23:18.562
Oh...

23:18.629 --> 23:21.097
Welcome to America, Mrs. Gravas.

23:21.165 --> 23:23.867
Thank you!

23:23.935 --> 23:26.102
I passed!

23:35.446 --> 23:39.349
(theme song playing)

23:59.804 --> 24:01.271
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

24:01.338 --> 24:02.339
