00:06.772 --> 00:09.273
Hi there. Today in
the <i>tool time</i> corral,

00:09.274 --> 00:11.676
We're talking about
a different kind of power.

00:11.677 --> 00:15.013
<i>(spits)</i>
<i>(ping)</i>

00:17.216 --> 00:20.518
Sawhorse power,
'cause a man is judged
by his pair of ponies.

00:20.519 --> 00:22.087
That's right, partner.

00:22.088 --> 00:24.756
And the sturdiest sawhorses
are made of pine or fir.

00:24.757 --> 00:27.592
A good rule of thumb
is it should be sturdy enough

00:27.593 --> 00:30.161
To support al's mom
after a big buffet.

00:31.697 --> 00:35.634
You know, tim, my shop tastes
normally run old-fashioned,

00:35.635 --> 00:38.169
But when it comes
to the sawhorse,

00:38.170 --> 00:41.940
I've decided
to let my hair down
and switch to metal.

00:41.941 --> 00:44.109
Now I'm a guy of the '90s.

00:44.110 --> 00:46.645
Would that be 1890s, al?

00:46.646 --> 00:48.647
This sawhorse
is half the weight

00:48.648 --> 00:51.549
And can easily be moved
around the job site.

00:51.550 --> 00:54.585
<i>(whistles)</i>
that was an incredible
demonstration, al.

00:54.586 --> 00:57.756
But if you want a sawhorse
that'll get you around
the job site,

00:57.757 --> 01:00.025
I got the stallion for you.

01:00.026 --> 01:01.626
Tim.
Al.

01:01.627 --> 01:04.394
Tim, where...
Where are y...

01:04.396 --> 01:08.800
Well, while we're waiting
for tim, I, uh...

01:08.801 --> 01:11.670
I would...
Well, I'd like to regale you

01:11.671 --> 01:16.041
With an anecdote
about my first sawhorse.

01:16.042 --> 01:18.376
Her name was lilly.

01:18.377 --> 01:20.812
<i>(â™ª "the lone ranger" theme)</i>

01:20.813 --> 01:24.182
<i>(engine revs in time)</i>

01:29.922 --> 01:33.357
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:33.358 --> 01:34.726
Whoa.

01:34.727 --> 01:38.096
Your sawhorse
has an engine?
Right.

01:38.097 --> 01:41.399
It'll do 160
on the interstate.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.735
Listen to this thing idle.
Take it out of gear.

01:43.736 --> 01:45.070
Huh?
Out of gear.

01:45.071 --> 01:47.172
Aah! Ohh!

01:47.173 --> 01:49.307
<i>(birds twittering)</i>

02:58.744 --> 03:01.746
What do you think? Should we
put the kids in the middle?

03:06.385 --> 03:08.719
Dad, can we use
the intercom yet?

03:08.720 --> 03:10.288
Not yet.

03:10.289 --> 03:12.791
We ran the speaker wires
to the amplifier,

03:12.792 --> 03:14.458
Down to the transformer,

03:14.459 --> 03:16.694
Which we goosed up
to give it what?

03:16.695 --> 03:18.129
More power!

03:18.130 --> 03:21.099
Yeah.

03:21.100 --> 03:23.101
Dad, is the transformer

03:23.102 --> 03:26.137
The thing
that you set on fire?

03:26.138 --> 03:28.273
You call that a fire?

03:28.274 --> 03:32.177
No, when I fixed
the water heater,
that was a fire.

03:32.178 --> 03:34.212
Right.

03:34.213 --> 03:37.315
All right, I should be able
to get your mom now.

03:39.185 --> 03:41.419
Hey, jill, can you hear me?

03:41.420 --> 03:43.087
Jill can you hear me?

03:43.088 --> 03:45.890
Of course I can hear you.
I'm right behind you.

03:45.891 --> 03:47.892
Thought you were
in the garage.

03:47.893 --> 03:50.428
We're testing out
the new intercom.
Today is the day.

03:50.429 --> 03:53.198
That you come to your senses
and realize we don't need
an intercom?

03:53.199 --> 03:56.500
The day I come to my senses
is a long way off.

03:56.501 --> 03:58.502
Mark, come on.

03:58.503 --> 04:00.805
I'm gonna go buy you
some clothes.

04:00.806 --> 04:03.641
I wanna stay here
until the intercom
starts working.

04:03.642 --> 04:06.711
Believe me, we'll be back
way before that happens.

04:10.482 --> 04:11.983
Hey, dad.
Hey, randy.

04:11.984 --> 04:13.818
Hey, jeremy.
How you doin'?

04:13.819 --> 04:15.320
Can't complain.
All right.

04:15.321 --> 04:17.620
<i>(intercom whistles</i>
<i>and hums)</i>

04:17.622 --> 04:21.326
What's that, the emergency
broadcast system?

04:21.327 --> 04:23.328
Yeah. We're at war
with the english.

04:23.329 --> 04:25.330
Apparently they want
their muffins back.

04:25.331 --> 04:27.832
<i>(british accent)</i> line 'em up.
Give us our muffins.

04:27.833 --> 04:29.968
Shine 'em up.
Put butter on 'em. I want...

04:29.969 --> 04:32.803
All right, boys...
Dad, could we?

04:32.804 --> 04:35.373
<i>(normal voice)</i> oh.

04:35.374 --> 04:37.375
Come on,
we better get upstairs.

04:37.376 --> 04:39.277
This thing could blow
at any minute.

04:39.278 --> 04:42.513
Wait a minute.
How can you blow up
an intercom?

04:42.514 --> 04:44.282
You don't know my dad.

04:44.283 --> 04:47.852
He blew up a dishwasher,
a blender and seven toasters.

04:49.288 --> 04:52.156
Two blenders,
five toasters.

04:52.157 --> 04:54.158
He's had so many accidents,

04:54.159 --> 04:56.995
The hospital gave him
a preferred customer card.

04:59.899 --> 05:03.601
Two more head injuries,
we get a free trip to hawaii!

05:05.771 --> 05:08.139
<i>(intercom whistling</i>
<i>and humming)</i>

05:10.742 --> 05:13.912
<i>(jeremy)</i>
<i>boy, your dad's funny.</i>
<i>I wish my dad was like that.</i>

05:13.913 --> 05:16.915
<i>(randy) no, you don't.</i>
<i>My dad's a total goofball.</i>

05:16.916 --> 05:18.749
<i>Ever see "tool time"?</i>

05:18.750 --> 05:22.186
<i>I thought all those screwups</i>
<i>were just an act.</i>
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

05:22.187 --> 05:25.189
<i>They're thinking of changing</i>
<i>the name of the show</i>
<i>to "fool time."</i>

05:25.190 --> 05:28.426
<i>(both laugh)</i>

05:28.427 --> 05:31.229
<i>(intercom whistles and hums)</i>

05:33.232 --> 05:34.598
Hi, mom.

05:34.599 --> 05:37.068
Hi. Where have you been?
At the library.

05:37.069 --> 05:39.437
Why, did they install
video games there?

05:39.438 --> 05:42.640
No. I went
to check out a book.

05:42.641 --> 05:44.875
You checked out a book?

05:44.876 --> 05:48.179
<i>David copperfield?</i>
Since when have you been
into charles dickens?

05:48.180 --> 05:50.748
Mom, I love charles dickens.

05:53.885 --> 05:57.888
"no author has
more brilliantly captured
the poignancy of youth."

05:59.524 --> 06:01.359
Give me a break.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.361
Why did you check out
that book?

06:03.362 --> 06:07.065
All right.
Jennifer's starting to like
this new guy named lance.

06:07.066 --> 06:09.067
They talk about reading
all the time,

06:09.068 --> 06:11.135
And this is jennifer's
favorite book.

06:11.136 --> 06:13.404
So you said
it was your favorite, too?

06:13.405 --> 06:16.540
Well, yeah.
Now I can talk to her
about it.

06:16.541 --> 06:19.043
You must be really worried
about jennifer,

06:19.044 --> 06:22.813
'cause <i>david copperfield</i>
is a long book.

06:22.814 --> 06:24.715
How bad can it be?

06:24.716 --> 06:26.717
On his last tv special,

06:26.718 --> 06:28.919
He made
the statue of liberty
disappear.

06:28.920 --> 06:32.957
Oh, no! Oh, no, no, no.
Honey, no. No.

06:32.958 --> 06:35.726
This is not david copperfield
the magician.

06:35.727 --> 06:39.063
This is david copperfield
the tortured waif.

06:39.064 --> 06:42.900
You know,
64 chapters' worth.

06:42.901 --> 06:46.204
Oh, man.
"oh, man" is right.

06:46.205 --> 06:48.373
<i>(intercom whistling</i>
<i>and humming)</i>

06:50.742 --> 06:53.144
Tim!

06:53.145 --> 06:54.545
Tim!

06:54.546 --> 06:57.081
What?
Oh!

06:57.082 --> 06:59.850
The airplanes flying around
are causing all the static
on this thing.

06:59.851 --> 07:01.852
Why don't you
just call the airport

07:01.853 --> 07:05.990
And tell 'em that they're
interfering with your intercom?

07:05.991 --> 07:08.993
<i>(high-pitched whine)</i>

07:08.994 --> 07:12.430
Stupid thing.
Stupid intercom!

07:12.431 --> 07:15.666
Is something
bothering you?
No.

07:15.667 --> 07:17.502
So slugging the intercom

07:17.503 --> 07:20.371
Is just part
of the installation process?

07:20.372 --> 07:23.941
Does randy seem different
to you lately?

07:23.942 --> 07:26.144
What do you mean?

07:26.145 --> 07:29.180
He was making fun of me
in front of jeremy.

07:29.181 --> 07:32.350
What kind of guy makes jokes
at other people's expense?

07:32.351 --> 07:34.785
I don't know.
Maybe we should ask al.

07:34.786 --> 07:37.288
We work together.
We have a give-and-take
relationship.

07:37.289 --> 07:39.290
I give it, he takes it.
That's different.

07:39.291 --> 07:42.293
Randy jokes about you,
you joke about randy.
That's just your relationship.

07:42.294 --> 07:44.162
This is behind my back.

07:44.163 --> 07:46.464
What were you doing,
eavesdropping on him?

07:46.465 --> 07:49.700
No. The intercom
in his room was on.
I just heard him talking.

07:49.701 --> 07:52.703
You mean
it was actually working?

07:52.704 --> 07:56.307
For a second or so, yeah.

07:56.308 --> 07:58.943
He was talking
about how I screw up
all the time at work.

08:00.479 --> 08:03.013
Well...

08:03.014 --> 08:07.818
Honey, it's not exactly
a state secret.

08:07.819 --> 08:10.821
He said they should change
the name of the show

08:10.822 --> 08:12.823
From <i>tool time</i> to <i>fool time?</i>

08:12.824 --> 08:15.159
If this is really
bothering you this much,

08:15.160 --> 08:17.495
I think you should
talk to him about it.

08:17.496 --> 08:20.831
I don't wanna talk to him.
You can't let stuff
like this fester.

08:20.832 --> 08:24.502
Sure I can. Guys always
let stuff fester.

08:24.503 --> 08:27.472
Remember the addams family?

08:27.473 --> 08:30.341
Uncle fester,
not aunt fester.

08:30.342 --> 08:32.710
Whoa.
Excellent point, tim.

08:32.711 --> 08:36.246
I'll call him down here.

08:36.248 --> 08:39.350
Hey, randy, come down here.
I want to talk to you
for a minute.

08:39.351 --> 08:41.018
<i>(high-pitched whine)</i>

08:41.019 --> 08:42.820
<i>(man) flight 211,</i>

08:42.821 --> 08:44.822
<i>You're clear for takeoff</i>
<i>on runway seven.</i>

08:49.861 --> 08:53.564
Man, I finally got through
the introduction.

08:53.565 --> 08:56.066
Man, by the time
you finish that book,

08:56.067 --> 08:58.969
Jennifer's gonna be
a grandmother.

08:58.970 --> 09:02.006
Yeah, but if I wanna keep her,
I have to get through it.

09:02.007 --> 09:05.243
Why? You never read anything
for a girl before.

09:05.244 --> 09:07.245
Yeah, but this is junior high.

09:07.246 --> 09:09.947
You have to work a lot harder
to impress the girls.

09:09.948 --> 09:14.785
So sticking straws up your nose
doesn't work anymore?

09:14.786 --> 09:17.155
Oh, no. That's still big.

09:19.758 --> 09:21.659
Hey, guys.
Hi, dad.

09:21.660 --> 09:24.662
Would you mind going
downstairs for a minute
so I can talk to randy?

09:24.663 --> 09:27.731
Come on, dad.
I'm trying to read.
You can read it later.

09:27.732 --> 09:29.567
<i>"david copperfield"?</i>
That guy's great.

09:29.568 --> 09:33.003
He made
the statue of liberty disappear.

09:35.340 --> 09:38.609
Wrong guy, dad.
This is about the tragic waif.

09:38.610 --> 09:40.545
Oh, yeah, the tragic waif.

09:43.549 --> 09:45.550
Can we talk
for a minute?

09:45.551 --> 09:47.552
If you wanted to talk to me,

09:47.553 --> 09:50.154
Why didn't you just call me
on the intercom?

09:50.155 --> 09:53.957
Or is that still picking up
ambulance calls?

09:53.958 --> 09:56.394
You really bust my chops
sometimes, you know?

09:56.395 --> 09:59.297
Well, dad,
you make it so easy.

09:59.298 --> 10:01.299
But you could go
over the line,

10:01.300 --> 10:03.434
Like that little conversation
with jeremy.

10:03.435 --> 10:05.436
We were just kidding around.

10:05.437 --> 10:07.605
You think calling me names
is kidding around?

10:07.606 --> 10:09.674
I didn't call you names.

10:09.675 --> 10:12.677
I heard
you call me a goofball.

10:12.678 --> 10:14.978
What, were you standing
outside my door?

10:14.979 --> 10:16.980
No, I heard it
through the intercom.

10:16.981 --> 10:19.483
Oh, so is that why
you put it in...
No.

10:19.484 --> 10:21.485
...So you could spy on me?

10:21.486 --> 10:23.487
You ever hear
of a thing called privacy?

10:23.488 --> 10:26.156
Have you ever heard of a thing
called respect for your father?

10:26.157 --> 10:30.027
What about respect for me?
You were eavesdropping.
It was an accident, kid.

10:30.028 --> 10:33.231
The point is,
you called my work fool time.
So?

10:33.232 --> 10:36.567
So? <i>Tool time</i>
puts clothes on your back
and food in your stomach.

10:36.568 --> 10:38.736
Look at me
when I'm talking to you.

10:38.737 --> 10:41.071
I heard what you said.
And?

10:41.072 --> 10:44.342
If you didn't grunt like an ape
and break things all the time,

10:44.343 --> 10:47.245
Maybe your show
wouldn't be such a joke.

10:47.246 --> 10:49.247
Hey, wait a minute.
My show's a joke?

10:49.248 --> 10:51.616
So that means
I'm a joke to you?

10:52.751 --> 10:55.686
I got a joke for you.
I got a good joke for you.

10:55.687 --> 10:57.622
Here's the punch line -
a week.

10:57.623 --> 10:59.624
What's the question?
<i>(imitates buzzer)</i> too late.

10:59.625 --> 11:02.126
The question is,
"how long are you gonna
be grounded for?"

11:02.127 --> 11:05.463
That's a joke.
You're not laughing.
Maybe you heard that one before.

11:10.235 --> 11:13.237
Hey, mark,
can you hear me?

11:13.238 --> 11:15.873
Mark, can you hear me?!
<i>What?</i>

11:15.874 --> 11:18.476
Can you hear me
on the intercom?

11:18.477 --> 11:21.312
<i>Dad, I can't hear you!</i>
What?

11:21.313 --> 11:23.581
Dad, I can't read
with all this yelling!

11:23.582 --> 11:25.082
Would you quiet down?

11:25.083 --> 11:27.752
Boy, how did we ever get along
without this intercom?

11:27.753 --> 11:30.488
That's why I installed it,
so we wouldn't have
all this yelling.

11:30.489 --> 11:33.791
Hey, mark, tell you what.
Turn up the volume real loud!

11:33.792 --> 11:36.226
<i>What?!</i>
Ahh!

11:36.227 --> 11:39.497
How's <i>david copperfield</i>
coming?
Pretty slow.

11:39.498 --> 11:43.033
Well, stick with it.
It's a classic.

11:43.034 --> 11:45.202
What ever happens
to aunt betsey?

11:45.203 --> 11:48.406
Aunt betsey? Well...

11:48.407 --> 11:51.642
Come on, honey.
What did happen
to aunt betsey?

11:51.643 --> 11:55.112
You read the book,
didn't you?
Of course I read it.

11:55.113 --> 11:58.115
I just don't want to
spoil the ending for him.

11:58.116 --> 11:59.850
<i>(horn honks)</i>

11:59.851 --> 12:02.019
Honey, get your bag.
See you, dad.

12:02.020 --> 12:05.255
Bye, mom. Bye, dad.
Bye-bye, sweetie.
Get a coat on.

12:05.256 --> 12:07.925
Here, randy.
Bye, mom.

12:07.926 --> 12:10.928
<i>(whispers)</i> say something
to your father.

12:10.929 --> 12:13.230
Oh, yeah.
Dad, by the way,

12:13.231 --> 12:17.034
I'm still getting
the all-spanish station
through my intercom.

12:17.035 --> 12:20.538
That's real funny.
Don't quit your day job.

12:20.539 --> 12:22.473
Bye, sweetie.

12:22.474 --> 12:24.575
Well, that was real adult.

12:24.576 --> 12:27.678
<i>(kid's voice)</i>
well, he started it.

12:27.679 --> 12:30.481
Honey, you know
what kids are like this age.

12:30.482 --> 12:32.516
They say a lot
of really mean things.

12:32.517 --> 12:34.518
Brad never called me
a joke.

12:34.519 --> 12:37.221
No, he just broke windows
and got brought home
by the police,

12:37.222 --> 12:38.389
You remember that?

12:38.390 --> 12:41.091
Why can't randy
be more like that?

12:41.092 --> 12:43.927
I was just like randy
when I was his age.

12:43.928 --> 12:47.231
You wouldn't believe
the things I used to say
to my mother.

12:47.232 --> 12:50.334
Worse things
than I've said to her?

12:50.335 --> 12:54.372
Way worse. I remember
there was this one time,
she called me a nickname...

12:54.373 --> 12:56.374
She always called me
this nickname,

12:56.375 --> 12:58.642
But this time she said it
when I was 14.

12:58.643 --> 13:01.945
We'd just moved to a new place,
and she said it in front of
all my new friends.

13:01.946 --> 13:03.781
I was so mad at her.

13:03.782 --> 13:05.916
You wouldn't believe
the things that I called her.

13:05.917 --> 13:08.919
Forget what you called her.
What was the nickname?

13:08.920 --> 13:12.022
Oh, yeah, like I'm
really gonna tell you.

13:12.023 --> 13:14.425
Come on,
what was the nickname?

13:14.426 --> 13:18.462
You have to swear
that you won't breathe
a word of it to anybody.

13:18.463 --> 13:22.800
Cross my heart, hope to die,
hope a wrench hits me
right in the eye.

13:22.801 --> 13:25.202
Jilly-dilly.

13:25.203 --> 13:27.505
<i>(laughs)</i>

13:27.506 --> 13:29.540
Jilly-dilly.

13:29.541 --> 13:32.843
I don't want to hear this name
in this house ever again,
all right?

13:32.844 --> 13:36.380
I might have to say it
on <i>tool time.</i>
Don't you dare.

13:36.381 --> 13:39.650
So, did you get
what I was trying
to tell you about randy?

13:39.651 --> 13:41.084
I suppose.

13:41.085 --> 13:43.987
It really hurts
that he thinks
that I'm a joke.

13:43.988 --> 13:46.657
I try to be a real good father
to these boys.

13:46.658 --> 13:49.560
You're a great father.
And I'm a cool father.

13:49.561 --> 13:51.028
Very cool.

13:51.029 --> 13:54.799
I can burp
with the best of 'em.
Yes, you can.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.668
I can turn my eyelids inside out
and do that.

13:57.669 --> 13:58.936
Like nobody else.

13:58.937 --> 14:01.705
I can flick ear wax
20 feet across a room.

14:01.706 --> 14:04.542
That's why I married you.

14:04.543 --> 14:08.412
<i>(heidi)</i> does everybody know
what time it is?
<i>Tool time!</i>

14:08.413 --> 14:10.414
That's right. Binford tools
is proud to present

14:10.415 --> 14:13.884
Tim "the tool man" taylor!
Whoo!

14:15.119 --> 14:17.120
Thank you, heidi,
and welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

14:17.121 --> 14:19.156
I am tim "the tool man" taylor,

14:19.157 --> 14:22.827
And you all know my assistant,
al... Borland.

14:22.828 --> 14:24.662
What's the matter, tim?

14:24.663 --> 14:27.665
You run out of
stupid middle names?
Is it my birthday?

14:27.666 --> 14:30.801
I don't always
have to joke around.
This isn't <i>fool time.</i>

14:33.304 --> 14:36.206
Today we begin
the backyard fort.

14:36.207 --> 14:38.642
Oh, boy,
the kids'll love it.

14:38.643 --> 14:41.645
We're gonna
set our posts into the dirt,
so we need post-hole digging,

14:41.646 --> 14:43.881
Which is kind of tricky,
so... What the heck.

14:43.882 --> 14:45.883
Let's not use
the motorized one today.

14:45.884 --> 14:48.886
I'll show you all how to use
the manual post-hole digger.
It's simpler to use.

14:48.887 --> 14:51.121
You're suggesting
the manual one?
I figured it'd be easier.

14:51.122 --> 14:53.123
You've never suggested
the manual anything.

14:53.124 --> 14:56.694
I thought maybe...
Do you even know
what "manual" means?

14:56.695 --> 14:59.697
Does everything
have to be a joke around here?

14:59.698 --> 15:02.733
The important thing to remember
when building anything for kids
is safety.

15:02.734 --> 15:05.435
You want to pad
the whole base area
with woodchips.

15:05.436 --> 15:08.438
Every year, over a quarter
of a million kids are hurt
in playground accidents.

15:08.439 --> 15:09.940
Keep that in mind.

15:09.941 --> 15:12.943
Course, your original plans
called for a homemade cannon.

15:14.779 --> 15:17.280
Well, maybe I went
a little over the top.

15:17.281 --> 15:19.282
That's not my style today.

15:19.283 --> 15:21.519
I find that a little
hard to believe, tim.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.021
What's the catch?
There is no catch.

15:24.022 --> 15:26.356
I added
a little something fun
for the kids -

15:26.357 --> 15:29.026
A little signal button,
almost like a doorbell
for the fort.

15:29.027 --> 15:31.562
Press that
and listen to it.
Ok, I know. Ha-ha.

15:31.563 --> 15:33.564
That wasn't in the plans,
either.

15:33.565 --> 15:35.933
What, your little bell
will send 5,000 volts

15:35.934 --> 15:38.402
Coursing through my body?

15:38.403 --> 15:42.072
While he stands back and yells,
"remember the al-amo!"

15:42.073 --> 15:45.042
I just want you
to press the bell.
I know...

15:45.043 --> 15:48.378
It's just a setup, isn't it?
It's one big setup.
It is not a setup!

15:48.379 --> 15:51.381
Soon you'll start in
with the uncalled-for slams
against my mother...

15:51.382 --> 15:53.450
How she always shops
in the husky section.

15:53.451 --> 15:55.920
How she wiped out
the all-you-can-eat salad bar.

15:55.921 --> 15:58.355
I simply came out here
to put this thing together.

15:58.356 --> 16:02.092
Go ahead. Just say it.
My mother is a big fat cow!

16:10.401 --> 16:13.203
Goodness gracious, al.

16:13.204 --> 16:16.540
We'll be right back
after these messages
from binford tools.

16:21.479 --> 16:23.881
Hi-ho, neighbor.

16:23.882 --> 16:26.450
Look what I just found
here in my yard.

16:26.451 --> 16:30.821
Holy moly, wilson.
It's a rock!

16:30.822 --> 16:33.290
Oh, no, tim.
It's not just a rock.

16:33.291 --> 16:36.193
This is laminated
dolomitic micrite.

16:36.194 --> 16:39.396
This was here
even when the dinosaurs
roamed the earth.

16:39.397 --> 16:43.734
Imagine if this
400-million-year-old rock
could talk.

16:43.735 --> 16:47.537
Hey, brontosaurus!
Why don't you aim
that someplace else?

16:47.538 --> 16:48.839
<i>(laughs)</i>

16:48.840 --> 16:50.975
Always the jokester, tim.

16:50.976 --> 16:54.244
Not today. I was real serious
on <i>tool time</i> today.

16:54.245 --> 16:58.281
I'm surprised by that,
knowing your propensity
for jocularity.

16:58.282 --> 17:01.051
I did it
to make a point with randy.

17:01.052 --> 17:03.954
He said I act like an idiot
on the show.

17:03.955 --> 17:06.123
Ooh, ouch. That hurts.

17:06.124 --> 17:08.659
Well, this may be
small consolation, tim,

17:08.660 --> 17:10.694
But parents are the bone

17:10.694 --> 17:12.796
On which children
sharpen their teeth.

17:12.797 --> 17:14.964
You're right.
That's no help at all.

17:16.701 --> 17:19.970
What I'm saying is,
when a boy is young,
he worships his father.

17:19.971 --> 17:22.640
In order for the boy
to become a man,

17:22.641 --> 17:25.909
He's got to start
seeing his father
as a fallible human being,

17:25.910 --> 17:28.444
Stop seeing him as a god.

17:28.445 --> 17:31.481
It was easier
when he thought of me as a god.

17:31.482 --> 17:33.984
Well, you've still got
some time left with mark.

17:33.985 --> 17:36.987
Yeah, I know,
but I sure would miss
this stuff with randy.

17:36.988 --> 17:39.790
Our relationship
is real special.
He's a lot like me.

17:39.791 --> 17:42.793
We make jokes about each other,
but we laugh about it.

17:42.794 --> 17:44.795
I'm sure you're gonna
miss that, tim,

17:44.796 --> 17:46.797
But for the next four,
five years

17:46.798 --> 17:49.266
He's gonna seem like
a different person.

17:49.267 --> 17:51.501
I wasn't like that with my dad.
I worshipped him.

17:51.502 --> 17:53.737
How old were you again
when he died?

17:53.738 --> 17:54.938
11.

17:54.939 --> 17:57.875
How old is randy now?
12, going on...

17:57.876 --> 18:00.144
<i>(grunts)</i> oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

18:00.145 --> 18:03.147
Yeah. I didn't have a chance
to be rude to my dad,

18:03.148 --> 18:05.649
'cause he died
before I got the chance.

18:05.650 --> 18:07.151
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

18:09.087 --> 18:11.288
Boy, having kids is tough,
you know?

18:11.289 --> 18:13.824
Why do you think
I have rocks?

18:18.362 --> 18:21.165
Hi, brad.
Hi, mom.

18:21.166 --> 18:24.001
What are you doing?
You taking a break from
<i>david copperfield?</i>

18:24.002 --> 18:25.502
I stopped reading it.

18:25.503 --> 18:27.504
I decided
if a girl's gonna like me,

18:27.505 --> 18:29.740
She's gonna like me
for who I am.

18:29.741 --> 18:32.442
She dumped you, huh?

18:32.443 --> 18:33.877
Yep.

18:33.878 --> 18:36.914
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

18:38.482 --> 18:40.150
Are you ok?

18:40.151 --> 18:42.953
I mean, I know how much
you like jennifer.

18:42.954 --> 18:45.655
Yeah, but she's
really changed.

18:45.656 --> 18:47.991
Now she's into reading
and classical music.

18:47.992 --> 18:49.760
When I first met her,

18:49.761 --> 18:52.262
She was into cool stuff
like clothes and hair.

18:52.263 --> 18:55.766
Well... Gee.

18:55.767 --> 18:57.801
I guess this means that...

18:57.802 --> 19:01.371
I'm not gonna get to see her
anymore, huh?

19:01.372 --> 19:04.041
It's ok, mom.
There'll be other girls.

19:04.042 --> 19:05.575
Yeah, I know.

19:07.278 --> 19:09.379
I know.

19:09.380 --> 19:13.784
It's just that, you know...
I... I really liked <i>her,</i>

19:13.785 --> 19:16.453
And I didn't get to
say goodbye.

19:16.454 --> 19:18.989
It feels kind of unresolved.

19:21.226 --> 19:25.395
Do you want me
to have her come over
and she can dump <i>you?</i>

19:25.396 --> 19:27.898
Where's randy?
I think he's
up in his room.

19:27.899 --> 19:30.901
I gotta talk to him.
I just found out I'm not god.

19:30.902 --> 19:33.137
Oh, tim, I'm so sorry.

19:34.239 --> 19:35.773
<i>(mumbles)</i>

19:38.276 --> 19:41.611
Hey, randy, got a minute?

19:41.612 --> 19:43.747
According to you,
I've got a week.

19:45.516 --> 19:48.718
The other day,
you said some things
that were really out of line,

19:48.719 --> 19:51.922
But I've decided
that to ground you
is probably not the answer.

19:51.923 --> 19:54.224
Great. Catch you later.
Hold on a second.

19:54.225 --> 19:56.226
I know what's going on here.

19:56.227 --> 19:58.228
You're at the point
in your life

19:58.229 --> 20:00.697
Where you have to
clean your teeth
on my bones.

20:02.901 --> 20:04.234
What?

20:04.235 --> 20:07.938
For the next couple years,
you're not gonna be yourself.

20:07.939 --> 20:10.007
Who am I gonna be?

20:10.008 --> 20:12.375
A little wise guy
that smarts off to people

20:12.376 --> 20:15.045
That a lot of people
will think is a big jerk.

20:15.046 --> 20:17.047
Chip off the old block, eh?

20:17.048 --> 20:18.882
It's started already.
What?

20:18.883 --> 20:21.985
Adolescence -
the age of obnoxiousness.

20:21.986 --> 20:24.487
Every kid goes
through this stuff,

20:24.488 --> 20:27.257
And I'm just
gonna wait for you
on the other side.

20:27.258 --> 20:30.327
So you're saying it's ok
for me to make fun of you?

20:30.328 --> 20:33.596
No, I didn't say that.
I said I understand it.

20:33.597 --> 20:36.233
It's just your way
of rebelling against me,
I think.

20:36.234 --> 20:39.203
Well, did you rebel
against your father?

20:39.204 --> 20:43.140
Uh... He died
before I could be a real jerk.

20:43.141 --> 20:46.076
He'd be proud
if he could see you now.

20:46.077 --> 20:47.845
Hey-hey...

20:47.846 --> 20:51.181
That's another good example
of high obnoxious art.

20:51.182 --> 20:53.183
Uh, but the issue is here,

20:53.184 --> 20:55.719
I don't want you making jokes
about my job.

20:55.720 --> 20:57.387
Deal.

20:57.388 --> 20:59.389
Or me getting hurt
and screwing things up.

20:59.390 --> 21:01.859
Anything
that makes me look bad.

21:01.860 --> 21:04.661
What's left to joke about?

21:04.662 --> 21:06.296
Mom.

21:08.733 --> 21:12.435
All right. Hey, dad...

21:12.436 --> 21:16.340
I'm sorry that you never got
a chance to be obnoxious
with your father.

21:17.675 --> 21:19.076
Me too.

21:21.012 --> 21:22.512
You know,

21:22.513 --> 21:25.048
There was this one time
when I was nine,

21:25.049 --> 21:27.317
I really got him
steamed up, though.

21:27.318 --> 21:30.420
He finally let me play
with his butane torch.

21:31.990 --> 21:34.791
Well, what happened?

21:34.792 --> 21:37.327
I got to ride
in a fire truck...

21:39.364 --> 21:41.564
...And we got a new garage.

21:45.203 --> 21:47.104
<i>(horn honks/</i>
<i>siren wails)</i>

21:49.974 --> 21:51.141
Hey, guys.

21:51.142 --> 21:53.476
Nice shot.
Nice dunk.

21:53.477 --> 21:56.146
You wanna hear
something real funny
about your mother?

21:59.450 --> 22:03.287
She's not really married
to you?

22:03.288 --> 22:05.622
How long do you want
to stay up in your room?

22:05.623 --> 22:07.991
Hey, don't blame me.
It was adolescence.

22:07.992 --> 22:10.493
All right, listen,
what do you think
nana called her

22:10.494 --> 22:11.995
When she was little?

22:11.996 --> 22:15.198
Jill?

22:15.199 --> 22:18.035
A name
that might annoy her.

22:18.036 --> 22:19.403
Tim.

22:21.472 --> 22:24.341
Back off, all right?
What did she call her?

22:24.342 --> 22:26.509
When she was real little,
nana used to call her...

22:26.510 --> 22:28.711
<i>(jill) don't even</i>
<i>think about it, tim.</i>

22:30.514 --> 22:31.748
It works!
