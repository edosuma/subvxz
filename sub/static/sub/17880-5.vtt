00:04.405 --> 00:07.540
Veridian Dynamics is one of the most
successful companies in the world.

00:07.575 --> 00:10.593
To make it here, you have to
be very competitive.

00:10.765 --> 00:13.715
<i>Some compete to see who
has the biggest rocket.</i>

00:15.275 --> 00:17.790
<i>Others compete to see who
can be the fastest.</i>

00:20.015 --> 00:22.400
But no one's more competitive
than me and Veronica.

00:22.435 --> 00:26.285
- Race you to the elevator?
- Feelin' lucky?

00:31.255 --> 00:34.409
But it's that drive to win that keeps us
at the top of our game.

00:39.875 --> 00:41.008
I win!

00:41.635 --> 00:44.330
This is the most fun anyone has
ever had with hypodermic needles.

00:44.365 --> 00:46.300
It's not over yet.
It's still wobbling.

00:46.335 --> 00:48.070
And it can't come out for at least a minute.

00:48.105 --> 00:49.790
Same rules as for losing your virginity.

00:49.825 --> 00:52.180
Would you two say that
you were overly concerned

00:52.215 --> 00:55.765
with the outrageous prices
of store-bought wrapping paper?

00:56.215 --> 00:59.670
Yes, we're so concerned,
we need to be alone right now.

00:59.705 --> 01:02.690
My daughter is selling wrapping paper
to raise money for her school.

01:02.725 --> 01:05.230
Whoever sells the most
wins a trip to Disneyland.

01:05.265 --> 01:08.943
Second place gets to cry while
Rose and I go to Disneyland.

01:10.195 --> 01:12.030
- Uh, Phil will take ten rolls.
- What?

01:12.065 --> 01:15.344
You heard him. I'd leave now
before he changes his mind.

01:16.055 --> 01:18.198
And, Lem, I’ll also put you down for ten.

01:18.233 --> 01:21.933
One for each time I told you
not to play the needle game.

01:24.915 --> 01:27.790
- Ted knows everything we do.
- He's like a god,

01:27.825 --> 01:30.750
only it hurts more when he judges us.

01:30.785 --> 01:34.969
Hey, do you guys have the specs
for the solar-powered ovens?

01:42.985 --> 01:44.535
I hate coming down here.

01:44.735 --> 01:45.735
Sorry.

01:47.965 --> 01:51.600
Don't worry. We only play the clean needle game
with clean needles.

01:51.635 --> 01:52.935
Here's a band-aid.

01:54.885 --> 01:56.997
And there's your lady shoulder.

02:00.665 --> 02:03.120
Just bring the specs to my desk.
I'll be the one hoping

02:03.155 --> 02:06.292
I never hear the term
"lady shoulder" ever again.

02:07.615 --> 02:08.615
Wait.

02:09.345 --> 02:14.145
I thought we used the last of the band-aids when
you wanted to see what I’d look like with a moustache.

02:14.965 --> 02:16.610
These aren't band-aids.

02:16.645 --> 02:20.895
This is that experimental energy patch.
We just drugged Linda.

02:21.295 --> 02:23.095
I owe you an apology, Phil.

02:23.130 --> 02:24.571
When we set out to make energy patch

02:24.606 --> 02:27.400
look exactly like a band-aid,
I said it couldn't be done.

02:27.435 --> 02:28.585
I was wrong.

02:29.865 --> 02:31.670
- We should tell her.
- Or...

02:31.705 --> 02:34.250
we don't tell her so she doesn't
get mad at us again.

02:34.285 --> 02:35.640
I like where this is going.

02:35.675 --> 02:38.270
- We're going. That's it. It went.
- Yeah.

02:38.305 --> 02:39.620
She's just gonna have a little...

02:39.655 --> 02:41.541
extra energy. Why trouble her

02:41.576 --> 02:43.900
with something that might
force her to yell at us again?

02:43.935 --> 02:46.310
We're doing her a favor.
That's what's happening here.

02:46.345 --> 02:48.314
- So we're even.
- Even?

02:48.695 --> 02:50.284
She owes us.

02:53.505 --> 02:55.151
As you all know, we've been working on

02:55.186 --> 02:57.240
Veridian's new solar-powered ovens.

02:57.275 --> 02:59.860
We've had a great amount of success with it so far.

03:00.035 --> 03:02.185
If you guys will take a look at the chart.

03:03.065 --> 03:05.311
We're working on a contract
for solar-powered ovens,

03:05.346 --> 03:09.860
which the military plans to air-drop into
remote villages as a goodwill gesture.

03:09.895 --> 03:12.980
It'll be the only thing the military drops
that doesn't kill people.

03:13.015 --> 03:15.700
- The problem is--
- It kills people.

03:15.735 --> 03:19.050
Yeah, the plastic we're using
leaches toxins into food.

03:19.085 --> 03:22.610
However, the toxins are only released
when the ovens are exposed to sunlight.

03:22.645 --> 03:25.260
Which is the only time solar ovens work.

03:25.295 --> 03:29.140
Some days, it seems like everything
we do leaches toxins.

03:29.175 --> 03:30.870
Well, luckily, it can be fixed.

03:30.905 --> 03:32.521
Of course it can. We can do anything,

03:32.556 --> 03:36.279
because this is the greatest scientific team
that's ever been assembled.

03:39.016 --> 03:40.066
Let's do it!

03:44.535 --> 03:45.535
Where is she going?

03:45.645 --> 03:46.645
To do it?

03:49.052 --> 03:51.290
Anyway, the solar ovens can be fixed

03:51.325 --> 03:53.080
by using a more expensive material.

03:53.115 --> 03:56.990
Now the, uh, plastic in our bomb casings
is completely harmless.

03:57.025 --> 03:59.332
Well, it's nice to know people can safely eat

03:59.367 --> 04:00.890
off our unexploded bombs.

04:00.925 --> 04:03.062
- Thank you, everyone.
- Hang on.

04:04.451 --> 04:05.610
We have another problem.

04:05.645 --> 04:07.995
- Is this about the wrapping paper?
- No,

04:08.215 --> 04:10.474
this is about a little girl's dream...

04:10.625 --> 04:12.650
to sell the most wrapping paper.

04:12.685 --> 04:16.853
A dream that is now being challenged
by some insanely completive girl named Cynthia.

04:16.889 --> 04:20.789
Did you ever stop to think that maybe
you’re the insanely competitive one?

04:21.978 --> 04:24.933
Let me rephrase that. I'd like
five more rolls, please.

04:26.020 --> 04:30.464
Ted, since the military doesn't usually pay more
for something that kills fewer people,

04:30.499 --> 04:34.252
I need you to butter up General McMillan over dinner and
get some extra money out of them.

04:34.287 --> 04:37.219
Oh, man. Can't we just hope
they don't look at the invoice?

04:37.254 --> 04:39.133
Come on. The General respects you, Ted.

04:39.168 --> 04:42.570
Your experience, your charm,
the whole package. Oh,

04:42.605 --> 04:44.115
and your package.

04:45.189 --> 04:47.296
<b>Six months ago</b>

04:51.310 --> 04:54.137
I always enjoy doing business with you, Ted.

05:00.879 --> 05:03.743
Look, I like the general, and I like gay people--

05:03.778 --> 05:05.328
- Done.
- Wait.

05:05.751 --> 05:08.871
I just don't think it's right to flirt
for the sake of a deal.

05:08.906 --> 05:13.156
Besides, he's so grabby. I mean,
whatever happened to romance?

05:13.393 --> 05:16.904
What if I were to help you sell
your daughter's precious toilet paper?

05:16.939 --> 05:18.212
It's wrapping paper.

05:18.247 --> 05:20.462
It's not my fault I don't listen when you talk.

05:20.497 --> 05:22.695
But fine, whatever.
I can sell anything, Ted.

05:22.730 --> 05:25.033
I once sold a guy on having dinner
with a grabby general

05:25.068 --> 05:26.855
to help his daughter win a contest.

05:26.890 --> 05:28.073
Really, who?

05:28.504 --> 05:32.073
- Because I haven't agreed to that yet.
- You will. You're that competitive.

05:34.093 --> 05:35.937
Fine. It's a deal.

05:35.972 --> 05:38.588
If Rose wins, I will have dinner
with the general.

05:38.623 --> 05:42.332
But if he tries that "Lady and the Tramp"
Spaghetti thing again, I’m outta there.

05:51.367 --> 05:54.525
- We need our band-aid back.
- What? That's gross. Why do you want it back?

05:54.560 --> 05:56.592
- Because it's ours.
- Yeah.

05:56.627 --> 06:00.414
- We were just loaning it to you.
- Okay, you can have it back...

06:00.449 --> 06:02.073
But you gotta catch me first.

06:14.749 --> 06:15.749
Got it!

06:22.907 --> 06:26.168
So I sold... 50 rolls.

06:26.203 --> 06:29.294
Veronica sold... 20 rolls.

06:29.329 --> 06:33.514
And you sold... six.

06:34.065 --> 06:36.603
I only know, like, three grown-ups.

06:37.232 --> 06:39.944
You know, you're kind of a freak
about competition, dad.

06:39.979 --> 06:44.074
Competition's important, honey.
It motivates people to do their very best.

06:44.109 --> 06:46.205
Besides, you won't be calling me
a freak when I’m wearing

06:46.240 --> 06:49.513
my Pluto hat spinning in a teacup.

06:49.548 --> 06:53.916
Wait a minute. This Cynthia character
has sold 15 more rolls than us.

06:53.951 --> 06:56.772
- Who is this girl?
- She's new. You can click on her name

06:56.807 --> 06:59.479
- to find out more about her.
- Let's do that.

06:59.514 --> 07:01.824
If you want to crush your competition, which I--

07:01.859 --> 07:04.795
we-- do, you want to get
to know everything about them.

07:05.341 --> 07:07.783
How they think, what their interests are...

07:09.249 --> 07:12.068
What kind of wheelchair they're confined to.

07:16.015 --> 07:17.805
<i>Veridian Dynamics.</i>

07:17.840 --> 07:19.398
<i>Competition.</i>

07:19.433 --> 07:21.069
<i>Whether it's animals</i>

07:21.104 --> 07:24.376
<i>or this old woman and baby,
fighting to the death...</i>

07:25.314 --> 07:28.009
<i>Competition makes us stronger.</i>

07:28.044 --> 07:30.703
<i>In business, that means better products.</i>

07:30.738 --> 07:32.964
<i>Pills that look like candy,</i>

07:32.999 --> 07:35.009
<i>hands that can shoot lightning</i>

07:35.044 --> 07:38.329
<i>and a new generation
of hurricane-proof dogs.</i>

07:39.439 --> 07:41.233
<i>Veridian Dynamics.</i>

07:41.233 --> 07:42.446
<i>Veridian Dynamics.
Competition.</i>

07:42.446 --> 07:44.806
<i>Veridian Dynamics.
Competition. It makes everything better.</i>

07:49.829 --> 07:51.465
We have a problem.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.847
Cynthia, our competition
in the wrapping paper contest,

07:53.882 --> 07:57.359
- is in a wheelchair.
- Ooh. Yeah, that is a problem.

07:57.921 --> 08:01.617
It gives her a huge competitive advantage.
We're gonna have to step it up.

08:02.580 --> 08:03.855
Wait.

08:03.890 --> 08:08.546
You don't think competing all-out against
a girl who's disabled is wrong?

08:08.581 --> 08:12.186
Wrong? How should I know what's wrong?
I'm not some Greek philosopher.

08:12.221 --> 08:14.800
- What does Rose think?
- Ah, she's no help.

08:14.835 --> 08:16.647
I taught her everyone should
be treated equally.

08:16.682 --> 08:18.276
Well, then treat everyone equally.

08:18.311 --> 08:21.586
No, you're not supposed to really do that.
You're just supposed to teach it.

08:21.621 --> 08:25.248
Ted, you're a competitor. You want to win.
You just need to hear it's okay.

08:25.283 --> 08:26.447
No, I don't.

08:26.482 --> 08:27.896
But it is, right?

08:28.225 --> 08:31.394
Yes, we should treat this Cynthia
equally and beat the--

08:31.429 --> 08:32.672
Does she wear pants?

08:32.707 --> 08:33.717
I think so.

08:33.753 --> 08:35.765
Then let's beat them off her.

08:35.799 --> 08:39.652
Wait. You just want Rose to win so that
I’ll go have dinner with General McMillan.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.873
God, it's like you're obsessed with the guy.

08:41.908 --> 08:45.855
Ted, you've got to focus. This is about
selling solar ovens, not your love life.

08:51.393 --> 08:53.244
Linda's crying.

08:53.788 --> 08:56.075
Well, we got the patch off her, so we're good.

08:56.110 --> 08:58.762
Still, she's crying, and we like her, so...

08:59.350 --> 09:01.127
We should see what's wrong.

09:05.334 --> 09:06.877
Hey, Linda.

09:06.912 --> 09:08.284
What's wrong?

09:08.319 --> 09:11.420
The Jewish people have had
such a tumultuous history.

09:11.455 --> 09:14.208
And yet they were still able to give us this?

09:14.443 --> 09:16.277
The everything bagel--

09:16.457 --> 09:19.528
It's all you'd ever want in one bagel.

09:19.953 --> 09:21.248
I love it...

09:21.553 --> 09:24.254
And the chosen people who created it.

09:25.778 --> 09:29.532
Oh, I have been so emotional lately.

09:29.858 --> 09:31.510
- Well, maybe it's just--
- Why don't you shut up

09:31.510 --> 09:33.267
and stop trying to analyze me?

09:36.627 --> 09:40.155
Do you think wildly erratic emotions
could be a residual effect of the energy patch?

09:40.190 --> 09:41.462
Hard to tell.

09:41.497 --> 09:45.294
This is the problem when the company
will only pay for testing on drunk frat guys.

09:45.734 --> 09:48.696
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.

09:49.284 --> 09:52.085
We could just stand here without a plan.

09:52.120 --> 09:54.351
I like where this is going.

09:55.397 --> 09:57.896
I can give you 6 rolls for $5 a roll.

09:57.931 --> 10:02.000
Whoa. That's crazy. Why, that's well below
the current wholesale price.

10:02.035 --> 10:05.867
Too late. She promised.
I'm getting my checkbook.

10:05.902 --> 10:09.391
- We work well together. Like Batman and--
- I'm Batman.

10:09.426 --> 10:11.477
- It was my idea...
- I'm Batman!

10:11.512 --> 10:12.780
And Robin.

10:13.041 --> 10:17.162
Hi, guys. Hi, best-looking woman
in the company, possibly the universe.

10:17.197 --> 10:19.539
Hello, person who clearly wants
something from me.

10:19.574 --> 10:21.439
I do want something from you.

10:21.474 --> 10:23.848
I want to know how you got
to be so freakin' awesome.

10:23.883 --> 10:27.050
Look at you-- You got it all going on.

10:27.085 --> 10:30.783
You're an incredibly powerful woman,
you are so pretty.

10:31.111 --> 10:32.698
And your calves? Oh.

10:32.733 --> 10:35.410
They're like granite wrapped in silk.

10:36.476 --> 10:37.961
Is everything okay, Linda?

10:37.996 --> 10:42.147
You just said a whole bunch of stuff,
any one of which would be disturbing on its own.

10:42.182 --> 10:43.771
Disturbing?

10:43.806 --> 10:47.009
Well, maybe you wouldn't find me disturbing
if I was more like Veronica.

10:47.044 --> 10:49.215
Look at me. I'm more like Veronica.

10:49.570 --> 10:53.547
I'm tilting my head curiously. I once left
the ladies room without washing my hands.

10:53.582 --> 10:54.797
That's right. I saw you.

10:54.832 --> 10:57.442
Clearly she's lost her mind.
I wouldn't believe a word she said

10:57.477 --> 10:59.293
past that calf thing.

10:59.722 --> 11:01.832
Okay, there's something we hoped
we'd never have to tell you.

11:01.867 --> 11:03.842
You know how when you
accidentally dose someone, like

11:03.876 --> 11:05.306
with an experimental energy patch,

11:05.341 --> 11:07.128
and you hope they'll sit quietly at their desks,

11:07.128 --> 11:10.007
but instead they wander around drawing
unnecessary attention to themselves?

11:10.042 --> 11:12.180
We've done something eerily similar to that.

11:12.215 --> 11:16.299
What? You boneheads dosed me?
I could kill you!

11:17.434 --> 11:19.438
But then I would miss you so much.

11:19.473 --> 11:24.033
Based on the dose she received, we're confident
the effects should wear off within the next 24 hours.

11:24.068 --> 11:26.554
Thank you for your attention and forgiveness.

11:26.589 --> 11:28.603
Stop. Turn back.

11:29.844 --> 11:32.501
Dosing an employee is a serious offense.

11:32.729 --> 11:35.480
I'm Veronica. I'm so serious,
and I have pee-pee on my hands.

11:35.515 --> 11:37.673
I wash my hands, you drugged
up fruitcake.

11:37.708 --> 11:39.113
Okay, here's what's gonna happen.

11:39.148 --> 11:40.921
Okay, here's what's gonna happen.

11:40.956 --> 11:45.543
First, we're gonna cut you a lot of slack and hope
you don't say something that gets you fired.

11:45.578 --> 11:47.844
Second, Phil and Lem, you're not gonna
let Linda out of your sight

11:47.845 --> 11:50.058
until she's completely back to normal.

11:50.521 --> 11:53.562
Look at me. I'm Linda.
I'm making fun of everyone.

11:54.312 --> 11:55.796
Hey.

11:57.843 --> 11:59.783
Oh, good.
You're still awake.

12:00.173 --> 12:02.395
Crazy day, but...

12:02.751 --> 12:05.386
Veronica and I sold so much
wrapping paper,

12:05.421 --> 12:06.993
not only are you going to Disneyland,

12:07.028 --> 12:10.049
but Mickey's gonna be wearing your ears
on his head.

12:10.918 --> 12:12.811
Oh, wait. That's a horrifying image.

12:12.846 --> 12:16.500
Everyone at school hates me because
I'm beating the disabled girl.

12:16.535 --> 12:19.824
But everybody's equal.
We don't see disabled people.

12:20.202 --> 12:22.417
Well, we see them, we just don't care.

12:22.452 --> 12:25.676
Well, we care, we just don't treat
them differently.

12:25.711 --> 12:26.931
Well, they do have their own parking.

12:26.966 --> 12:30.969
Cynthia's had a really hard life, and
everyone else is letting her win.

12:31.326 --> 12:34.297
If I win, everyone's gonna be
so mad at me,

12:34.332 --> 12:36.518
I won't be able to go to school anymore.

12:36.997 --> 12:39.227
Can we not win, daddy?

12:39.262 --> 12:40.678
Please?

12:40.713 --> 12:42.583
I know it's hard for you.

12:43.066 --> 12:44.489
No, it's okay.

12:44.704 --> 12:46.207
We'll let Cynthia win.

12:46.242 --> 12:47.535
Come on.

12:48.440 --> 12:50.888
Mickey will wear her ears.

12:52.094 --> 12:53.145
Thank you, daddy.

12:53.180 --> 12:54.988
Could I sleep with the light
on tonight?

12:55.023 --> 12:57.597
- It was the ear thing, wasn't it?
- Little bit.

13:05.295 --> 13:07.039
These cookies are inedible.

13:07.074 --> 13:08.632
I made cookies!

13:08.992 --> 13:10.592
You made cookies an hour ago.

13:10.627 --> 13:11.927
Eat them!

13:13.625 --> 13:16.024
This is so much fun, having a sleepover.

13:16.059 --> 13:20.424
Well, Ted wanted us to keep an eye on you, and
when we tried to take you to my house,

13:20.459 --> 13:22.671
you bit me, so here we are.

13:23.349 --> 13:26.325
- There's a penny in this cookie.
- Just eat it. Eat it.

13:26.360 --> 13:28.360
Don't get her mad again.

13:29.847 --> 13:33.694
There's that baby again.
It cries every night.

13:33.816 --> 13:36.398
- Babies do that.
- Not tonight they don't.

13:36.433 --> 13:37.858
This ends now.

13:37.971 --> 13:39.989
Linda, you can't hurt a baby.

13:40.024 --> 13:42.416
Well, you can hurt them.
They're not indestructible.

13:42.451 --> 13:44.496
I meant it's morally indefensible.

13:44.531 --> 13:47.947
- Well, what if the baby killed a man?
- You and your moral puzzles.

13:47.982 --> 13:49.512
I just love 'em.

13:51.096 --> 13:54.773
Answer the door, baby. I know you're
in there. I can hear you crying.

13:57.951 --> 13:59.653
Linda, what's going on?

13:59.910 --> 14:01.959
- Why are you yelling at Stella?
- Stay out of this, Kathy.

14:01.994 --> 14:04.162
This is between me and the baby...

14:04.197 --> 14:07.109
who is just the cutest thing in the world.

14:07.253 --> 14:10.638
Oh, my god. Look at you. Hi, Stella.

14:10.855 --> 14:12.855
Can I hold her? Please.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.596
I don't think that's a good idea.

14:14.631 --> 14:18.681
So you're saying under no circumstances
would you harm the baby Hitler?

14:18.841 --> 14:21.195
Hey, fellas. Look what I got...

14:21.326 --> 14:22.569
a baby.

14:22.604 --> 14:23.954
I'm naming her Ted.

14:25.067 --> 14:29.385
This is exactly the type of thing the other
Ted wanted us to prevent.

14:29.420 --> 14:31.160
Linda? Linda?

14:32.107 --> 14:34.778
<i>The next morning, I told veronica that
we had to let Cynthia</i>

14:34.813 --> 14:36.542
<i>win the wrapping paper contest.</i>

14:37.163 --> 14:39.154
<i>She took it better than expected.</i>

14:39.189 --> 14:41.284
You're soft and weak, Ted,

14:41.319 --> 14:42.420
like a geisha.

14:42.455 --> 14:44.237
Rose is being teased at school.

14:44.272 --> 14:46.799
She's far more important to me than
a wrapping paper contest.

14:46.834 --> 14:49.066
If she wants me to stop selling,
I'm stopping.

14:49.101 --> 14:51.004
Fine, quit. I don't give a crap.

14:51.039 --> 14:53.839
So when are you having dinner
with the general?

14:54.106 --> 14:55.108
I'm not.

14:55.143 --> 14:57.292
Because technically,
I only had to do that

14:57.327 --> 14:59.298
if Rose won the trip to Disneyland.

14:59.333 --> 15:02.987
If she's not gonna have a magical experience,
neither is the general.

15:03.022 --> 15:07.656
Well, if Rose has to win for you to have that
dinner, then I'm gonna make sure rose wins.

15:07.691 --> 15:10.128
- Then I'm gonna make sure she loses.
- Then it is on.

15:10.163 --> 15:13.643
It'll be like two great heavyweights going
toe-to-toe, and I'm Ali

15:13.678 --> 15:15.631
and Frazier and Foreman.

15:18.975 --> 15:22.783
Sure, I could've just agreed to have dinner
with the general to end this thing,

15:22.818 --> 15:24.605
but I know I can beat Veronica.

15:24.640 --> 15:27.821
At the company picnic, I beat her
in the 3-legged race.

15:27.856 --> 15:32.002
Although, we both lost to something Lem and
Phil created in the lab.

15:32.037 --> 15:34.489
I don't get it. Why do you need to buy back
all the wrapping paper?

15:34.524 --> 15:36.115
Because it's dangerous, Mindy.

15:36.150 --> 15:38.671
It's a choking hazard, it's made of lead
and prolonged exposure

15:38.706 --> 15:40.939
could cause violent incontinence.

15:41.294 --> 15:45.780
It could stain your hands, stunt your growth
and cause testicular desiccation.

15:45.815 --> 15:47.697
Hoof-and-mouth, dry mouth, trench mouth,

15:47.732 --> 15:51.732
and if you hold it up to the light,
you can see Santa's penis.

15:54.582 --> 15:56.233
- Ted.
- What? What's coming?

15:56.268 --> 15:59.268
Relax. I'm okay now.
The effects wore off.

15:59.383 --> 16:02.038
Unfortunately, it was several hours after
I stole a baby.

16:02.073 --> 16:04.233
- You stole a baby?
- Only for a few seconds.

16:04.268 --> 16:07.348
Turns out, just because you write your name
on something doesn't mean you get to keep it.

16:07.383 --> 16:10.257
Yeah, I think babies have to be notarized.

16:10.292 --> 16:12.338
Wait. Weren't Lem and Phil supposed
to be watching you?

16:12.373 --> 16:14.778
Yeah, there's a lot of things those guys
don't do well:

16:14.813 --> 16:19.227
Watch me, not dose me, stop me before
I write my name on a baby.

16:19.262 --> 16:22.058
I'm so pissed at them.
I want payback.

16:22.093 --> 16:24.695
Oh, I'm Linda.
I want payback.

16:25.451 --> 16:27.001
That's my payback.

16:29.922 --> 16:33.015
I got the wrapping paper back from half
the people I sold it to.

16:33.050 --> 16:37.700
The other half were willing to risk their
lives to see Santa's junk.

16:38.472 --> 16:39.472
That's Rose.

16:40.183 --> 16:42.020
Congratulations, loser.

16:42.314 --> 16:44.594
What? What do you mean,
you're way ahead?

16:44.629 --> 16:46.126
Lonny, prepare to cash in your pension,

16:46.161 --> 16:49.311
because I have an exciting new
investment opportunity.

16:50.111 --> 16:52.341
They're called derivatives,
and you can't lose.

16:52.376 --> 16:55.214
Multiple buyers owe a balance of payments
on their gift wrap,

16:55.249 --> 16:57.401
and so you buy shares of pooled debt,

16:57.436 --> 17:00.043
generating long-term dividends
with minimal risk.

17:00.078 --> 17:02.928
That's how I bought my house.
I'm in.

17:03.342 --> 17:05.156
Damn, she's good.

17:07.755 --> 17:10.172
Veronica has been busy all afternoon.

17:10.214 --> 17:11.756
She wasn't just gonna hand me my ass,

17:11.815 --> 17:13.700
she was gonna hand it to me gift wrapped.

17:13.734 --> 17:16.700
Analysts project that wrapping paper sales
are going to improve,

17:16.734 --> 17:19.740
so if you buy futures now
with the option to sell later,

17:19.775 --> 17:21.890
you can anticipate a
robust return.

17:21.925 --> 17:23.300
Veronica, what are you doing?

17:23.335 --> 17:24.540
Sorry, Ted.

17:24.575 --> 17:27.819
I've put Rose so far ahead,
there's no way anyone can catch her.

17:27.855 --> 17:31.830
Although, there's a 3% chance
she could end up in jail.

17:31.865 --> 17:33.608
Fine. You win.

17:34.055 --> 17:35.670
I like when that happens,

17:35.705 --> 17:37.077
and it happens a lot.

17:40.185 --> 17:42.950
<i>Rose was gonna be upset
Cynthia didn't win.</i>

17:42.985 --> 17:46.380
<i>I wasn't thrilled, either, because
it meant I had to have a lovely dinner</i>

17:46.415 --> 17:49.520
<i>with the General to convince him
to pay more for the solar ovens.</i>

17:49.555 --> 17:52.638
A body like a young Mark Spitz.

17:53.485 --> 17:56.654
Well, thank you, General.
I can't hear that enough.

17:57.255 --> 17:59.975
Although, five times is getting pretty close.

18:00.735 --> 18:01.739
So...

18:01.895 --> 18:03.345
let's talk business.

18:03.585 --> 18:06.510
I think we can go an additional 10 cents per unit.

18:06.545 --> 18:07.564
Really?

18:08.235 --> 18:09.743
That-- that's terrific.

18:09.845 --> 18:11.745
You're a handsome man, Ted.

18:12.695 --> 18:14.810
I hope that's not inappropriate for me to say.

18:14.855 --> 18:16.195
It's just a fact.

18:16.585 --> 18:18.470
Everybody's so damn touchy nowadays,

18:18.505 --> 18:20.626
I- I never know what the rules are.

18:21.095 --> 18:23.480
Time was, all we had to do was kill people.

18:23.515 --> 18:26.215
Now we have to leave them with parting gifts.

18:26.575 --> 18:27.875
Parting gifts.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.075
Are you propositioning me?

18:31.455 --> 18:32.467
What?

18:32.685 --> 18:33.700
No.

18:34.555 --> 18:37.510
It's just... These solar ovens,
they're not meant as handouts.

18:37.545 --> 18:39.160
They're meant as gifts, right?

18:39.265 --> 18:42.757
And if you want a gift to be appreciated,
it should be presented as a gift.

18:43.245 --> 18:44.545
That's interesting.

18:45.105 --> 18:48.082
Of course, coming from that mouth,
everything's interesting.

18:51.085 --> 18:52.830
I am a competitive guy.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.210
I make no apologies for that.

18:54.245 --> 18:56.260
If I see a way to win, I'm gonna take it.

18:56.845 --> 19:01.021
<i>And so I sold $5 million of
wrapping paper to the military,</i>

19:01.065 --> 19:03.206
<i>and I did it in Cynthia's name.</i>

19:03.635 --> 19:05.290
<i>She won the trip to Disneyland,</i>

19:05.325 --> 19:07.030
<i>Rose could keep going to school,</i>

19:07.075 --> 19:08.535
<i>and I beat Veronica.</i>

19:08.695 --> 19:11.530
No, you didn't. You still had
to go to dinner with the General.

19:11.565 --> 19:13.150
I sold more wrapping paper than you.

19:13.185 --> 19:14.600
That's not what we were competing over.

19:14.635 --> 19:16.310
It was one of the things we were competing over.

19:16.345 --> 19:18.190
You're so competitive, it's sick.

19:18.225 --> 19:19.580
Not as sick as you.

19:19.615 --> 19:21.047
That's right. I win.

19:21.555 --> 19:22.561
Again.

19:29.005 --> 19:31.610
Hey, do you think that patch could've
had any other side effects?

19:31.655 --> 19:34.210
Because I-- I've been really itchy lately.

19:34.245 --> 19:36.460
Well, itchiness is a side effect of many drugs.

19:36.495 --> 19:38.500
Sure beats crazy, though, doesn't it?

19:38.535 --> 19:42.040
I- I guess. It's just, my back is so scratchy.

19:42.155 --> 19:45.108
Maybe I should see a doctor
or a lawyer or something.

19:47.175 --> 19:49.320
As scientists with very little money,

19:49.355 --> 19:52.160
we suggest you don't see a lawyer.

19:52.195 --> 19:54.655
- We could take a look.
- Would you?

20:03.865 --> 20:04.870
Feathers?

20:04.935 --> 20:06.750
She's growing feathers.

20:06.785 --> 20:09.630
- Oh, my god. What do we do?
- Calm down. Just stay calm.

20:09.665 --> 20:11.202
- Feathers.
- What?

20:11.705 --> 20:13.212
Did he just say "feathers"?

20:13.395 --> 20:14.597
You'll be fine.

20:15.565 --> 20:18.010
- Chicken lady! Chicken lady!
- No, I can't be a chicken lady.

20:18.045 --> 20:20.050
I have so much I want to do in my life.

20:20.085 --> 20:22.560
I want to get married and have children

20:22.595 --> 20:24.990
and glue feathers to my back
to mess with idiot scientists

20:25.025 --> 20:26.680
who are careless with experimental drugs.

20:26.715 --> 20:29.820
You can still do all those things!

20:29.855 --> 20:31.263
Oh, wait.

20:31.815 --> 20:33.315
Well, now we're even.

20:33.405 --> 20:34.730
And next time you dose me...

20:34.765 --> 20:36.615
you better finish the job.

20:42.285 --> 20:43.580
Hi, Veronica.

20:43.615 --> 20:45.593
Hi, crazy pants.

20:45.705 --> 20:48.270
Listen, about what I said the other day...

20:48.305 --> 20:50.860
You called me powerful and
complimented my calves.

20:50.905 --> 20:52.220
That's all I remember.

20:52.255 --> 20:54.180
Oh, good. So you're not mad?

20:54.215 --> 20:55.940
You're obsessed with me, Linda.

20:55.975 --> 20:57.759
I like that about you.

20:59.625 --> 21:00.747
No, I'm not.

21:02.035 --> 21:04.218
Everyone in this place is nuts.
