BETWEEN 4:30 AND 5:00,
THE COCKTAIL HOUR.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.918
JACK WASN'T THERE
BUT BRUCE WAS.

16:37.063 --> 16:38.189
I KNOW
BRUCE, YES.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.457
RIGHT HERE.

16:39.599 --> 16:40.589

AFTER YOU.

16:40.733 --> 16:41.700
I HAD A SANDWICH

HOVV NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN, MR.
DUNDEE.

16:55.047 --> 16:56.481

IT WILL BE

16:56.616 --> 16:59.449
TO SEE MY VVISTFUL SAINT
NICHOLAS GOING UP THE RIVER.

16:59.585 --> 17:01.883
DO YOU SUPPOSE HE CAN
GET AS MUCH TEN YEARS?

17:02.021 --> 17:02.988
TEN YEARS?

17:03.122 --> 17:04.714
IT DON'T
LOOK GOOD, CORWIN.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.915
OF COURSE, THEY COULD
LOP OFF A FEW MONTHS

17:07.059 --> 17:09.289
IF YOU TELL THEM VVHERE THE
REST OF THE LOOT VVAS.

17:09.428 --> 17:11.589

HE MUST HAVE A LOT OF IT.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.500
I'M GLAD YOU

OH, I ADMIT IT, I ADMIT IT.

17:53.806 --> 17:56.138
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME
THE ESSENCE OF OUR PROBLEM

17:56.275 --> 17:58.642
IS THAT WE'RE DEALING
WITH A MOST UNUSUAL BAG.

17:58.778 --> 18:02.737

YOURSELF A POLICEMAN.
