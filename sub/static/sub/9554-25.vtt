Well, I just finished it.

01:33.393 --> 01:35.259
I got my summer job
application right here.

01:35.395 --> 01:37.489
Now, those greenbacks are gonna
start rolling in now.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.099
Yep, yes, sirree.

01:39.232 --> 01:40.291
Big deal.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.493
A bag boy at Fensick's Market.

01:42.636 --> 01:45.162
I bet you make manager
by the end of summer.

01:45.305 --> 01:46.329
No.

01:46.473 --> 01:48.771
Well, maybe head of cold cuts.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.604
I don't understand

01:50.744 --> 01:52.712
why you don't want to work
in the hardware store.

01:52.846 --> 01:55.907
I'll pay you $1.20 an hour
and that's my final offer.

01:57.384 --> 01:59.648
- No. Thanks, but no thanks, Dad.
- Why not?

01:59.786 --> 02:02.813
Because Lori Beth's going to be
a checker at Fensick's.

02:02.956 --> 02:03.889
Yeah, that's right.

02:04.024 --> 02:05.753
I'll pay you $1.30 an hour

02:05.892 --> 02:07.292
and that's my final offer.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.554
No, Dad, you see,

02:09.696 --> 02:11.721
Lori Beth and I are going
to be like the baboons.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.457
We've been studying about it

02:14.601 --> 02:15.693
in our cultural anthropology
course, see.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.736
It's really very simple.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.965
Baboons who have a mate,

02:20.107 --> 02:21.199
why, they're happy, you know?

02:21.341 --> 02:22.866
And-and their
productivity increases.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.171
But baboons with no mates...

02:25.312 --> 02:27.212
well, they're very sad.

02:27.347 --> 02:28.212
(doorbell rings)

02:28.348 --> 02:29.645
Oh, I'll get it.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.649
I'm going ape
listening to Richie.

02:31.785 --> 02:33.776
(laughs)

02:35.756 --> 02:37.747
- Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.
- Hi, Al!

02:38.892 --> 02:41.293
Oh, boy.

02:41.428 --> 02:42.293
Yeah.

02:42.429 --> 02:44.591
Still raining out.

02:44.731 --> 02:47.758
Oh, what a nice family.

02:47.901 --> 02:50.268
Howard, were you able to find
your cumberbund?

02:50.404 --> 02:54.033
Al, I could not let you
be the Man of the Year

02:54.174 --> 02:57.041
for the Sons of Italy
without a cumberbund.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.508
Here you are.

02:58.645 --> 03:01.114
It fits me... it may be
a little small on you.

03:01.248 --> 03:03.148
Hmm?

03:03.283 --> 03:05.581
Perfect.

03:05.719 --> 03:09.018
Alfred, I'll bet
you'll look so handsome.

03:09.156 --> 03:10.555
Oh... (chuckles)

03:10.690 --> 03:12.420
It's going to be
a big night for me.

03:12.559 --> 03:13.720
Who's the lucky lady, Al?

03:13.860 --> 03:15.590
Yeah, who are you taking
to your banquet?

03:15.729 --> 03:18.425
Oh, wow, you know, I've been
so excited and so busy,

03:18.565 --> 03:20.397
I just forgot all about that.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.559
Yeah, you know,
it's quite an honor.

03:22.702 --> 03:23.795
Well, you deserve it.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.234
Oh, I suppose.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.396
Hey, thanks, guy.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.167
- My pleasure.
- Have a wonderful time.

03:28.308 --> 03:29.173
(chuckles)
Oh. Bye-bye, everybody.

03:29.309 --> 03:30.333
JOANIE:
Bye, Al.

03:30.477 --> 03:32.036
Well, I got the cumberbund.

03:32.179 --> 03:34.648
Now I got to borrow a tux.

03:37.717 --> 03:40.619
Isn't it nice that Alfred
is finally being recognized

03:40.754 --> 03:42.620
for all the work he does
for the community?

03:42.756 --> 03:45.191
Well, it's just a shame.

03:45.325 --> 03:46.816
Al's having his big moment

03:46.960 --> 03:48.394
and nobody there
to share it with him.

03:48.528 --> 03:49.825
And Al needs
somebody by his side

03:49.963 --> 03:51.226
when he collects that award.

03:51.364 --> 03:53.595
He'll have somebody
by his side-- the presenter.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.668
- Oh...
- Come on, Marion.

03:55.802 --> 03:57.429
Well, maybe Richard's right.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.597
Why don't we fix him up
with Constance Brooks?

04:00.740 --> 04:04.006
Constance Brooks
is 72 years old.

04:04.144 --> 04:07.739
But she's still
cute as a button.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.648
I could get him a date.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.775
- You fix somebody up?
- Yeah.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.478
Why don't you get, uh, Fonzie

04:14.621 --> 04:16.487
to look in his little
black book, ape man?

04:16.623 --> 04:18.317
Fonzie's black book?

04:18.458 --> 04:19.391
Yeah.

04:19.526 --> 04:20.857
You think Mr. Smooth here

04:20.994 --> 04:23.395
doesn't have a little old
black book of his own?

04:24.431 --> 04:26.092
Let's see.

04:26.233 --> 04:28.099
Chock-full
of choice numbers, too.

04:28.235 --> 04:29.327
(Joanie laughs)

04:29.469 --> 04:30.664
All right, right here on-on

04:30.804 --> 04:32.203
Milwaukee Journal.

04:32.339 --> 04:33.238
Uh, Miller's Cleaners.

04:33.373 --> 04:35.808
Uh... Mom?

04:36.810 --> 04:38.334
That-That's okay, Rich.

04:38.478 --> 04:40.606
Fonz'll be back tomorrow.

04:40.747 --> 04:42.112
Why don't you look
under "D" for Dad?

04:42.249 --> 04:44.615
(scornfully):
"D" for Dad...

04:44.751 --> 04:46.378
"D" for...

04:46.520 --> 04:48.317
Dad.

04:53.260 --> 04:55.251
(thunder crashes)

04:59.099 --> 05:00.225
Hey, Al.

05:00.367 --> 05:01.766
Hi, Rich.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.302
You look like you should
be on a can of sardines.

05:04.437 --> 05:06.963
Oh, well, yeah,
my mom got me this outfit.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.597
Oh, Al, I just wanted
to talk to you.

05:08.742 --> 05:09.675
It's about Saturday night.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.107
- And I...
- I can't talk, Rich.

05:11.244 --> 05:12.302
Busy, busy, busy-

05:12.445 --> 05:13.879
Well...

05:21.855 --> 05:22.913
Well, Rich, old man,

05:23.056 --> 05:24.785
we got our summer jobs...

05:24.925 --> 05:26.620
- Well...
-...working on the docks.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.786
Associate longshoremen.

05:34.501 --> 05:35.991
Give me a break.

05:36.136 --> 05:37.001
- No lie, Rich.
- Yeah.

05:37.137 --> 05:38.434
We start Saturday.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.403
We work weekends
till school's out.

05:40.540 --> 05:41.837
We're going to be real men.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.966
Hard guys.

05:45.712 --> 05:47.407
Yeah, hard guys.

05:47.547 --> 05:50.346
Ruddy complexions,
maybe even tattoos.

05:50.483 --> 05:52.952
You want us to put in
a good word for you, mate?

05:53.086 --> 05:55.077
You look like
a hearty lad, ha...

05:56.690 --> 05:59.125
Uh, I think I'm doing fine
with my job at Fensick's Market.

05:59.259 --> 06:00.784
- Go on.
-(laughs)

06:00.927 --> 06:02.918
Work in a market
all summer with Lori Beth...

06:03.063 --> 06:04.621
- Yeah. -...while Pots
and I ride the nets

06:04.764 --> 06:06.391
and cavort with
waterfront trollops?

06:06.533 --> 06:07.932
POTSIE:
Come on, Ralph.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.433
- Forget Rich.
- Right.

06:09.569 --> 06:11.094
Let's go down to the docks,
you know?

06:11.238 --> 06:13.604
Meet with our cronies,
spit in the gutter and swear.

06:13.740 --> 06:16.004
Nah, it's raining outside.

06:16.142 --> 06:17.439
Let's just swear.

06:17.577 --> 06:20.274
♪ Heave ho, heave ho... ♪

06:24.651 --> 06:26.779
Oh, Al, do you think
I could talk to you now?

06:26.920 --> 06:27.785
I'm sorry, Rich.

06:27.921 --> 06:28.820
Yeah, I-l know,
busy, busy, busy.

06:28.955 --> 06:30.616
Busy means business.

06:30.757 --> 06:32.748
All right, well...

06:34.000 --> 06:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:44.204 --> 06:46.229
Kickstand me.
Go right ahead.

06:46.373 --> 06:47.397
- Oh.
- Fonz.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.338
- Yeah. -You can't bring
your bike in here.

06:49.476 --> 06:51.239
What if the health inspector
should come in?

06:51.378 --> 06:52.436
Hey, Al, come here.

06:52.579 --> 06:55.480
Would I leave you
in the rain, Al?

06:55.615 --> 06:57.242
Well...

06:57.384 --> 06:59.978
I guess I'll just tell them
that I boiled it.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.145
Hey, there you go, there you go.

07:02.289 --> 07:03.278
Aren't you going
to say anything?

07:03.423 --> 07:04.356
Huh?

07:04.491 --> 07:05.822
Don't you notice anything new?

07:09.496 --> 07:12.158
Hey, look at this trophy.
I got first prize right here.

07:12.299 --> 07:13.163
RICHIE:
Oh, right.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.289
Yeah, it's-it's nice.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.458
Yeah, what are you
talking about, "nice"?

07:15.602 --> 07:19.368
No, uh,
"Oh, golly gee, Fonz," huh?

07:19.506 --> 07:21.565
No "neato, Fonz"?

07:21.708 --> 07:23.267
It's neato, Fonz.

07:23.410 --> 07:24.673
Hey, that's better,
that's better.

07:24.811 --> 07:26.677
I'm sorry, my mind's
on something else.

07:26.813 --> 07:27.905
L...

07:28.048 --> 07:29.811
I'm trying to figure out
a way to get Al a date.

07:29.949 --> 07:31.679
You see, he-he's got
this big awards banquet.

07:31.818 --> 07:33.115
He's getting the award.

07:33.253 --> 07:35.881
I just think it'd make it
a little nicer for him if he...

07:36.022 --> 07:38.286
if he had someone to-to share
the experience with him.

07:38.425 --> 07:39.551
You know, like-like you had

07:39.693 --> 07:40.921
when you got your trophy.

07:41.061 --> 07:44.326
I don't think Al can handle
12 girls right now.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.364
No, just a regular date.

07:46.499 --> 07:47.592
Who knows?

07:47.734 --> 07:49.463
Maybe Al will start
going out more often then.

07:49.602 --> 07:50.626
What do you think, Fonz?

07:50.770 --> 07:51.863
Can-can you fix him up
with a date?

07:52.005 --> 07:54.201
Hey, I could fix up Boys Town.

07:54.341 --> 07:55.569
(laughs)

07:55.709 --> 07:58.507
<i>AL: I want to thank you guys
for fixing me up,</i>

07:58.645 --> 07:59.771
<i>but I'm nervous.</i>

07:59.913 --> 08:01.142
Do I look okay?

08:01.281 --> 08:02.714
Dashing? Presentable?

08:02.849 --> 08:04.214
Cute?

08:04.351 --> 08:05.943
All of those things.

08:06.086 --> 08:09.544
You know, since Rosa Coletti,
I haven't dated much

08:09.689 --> 08:12.682
and I'm not sure of myself
anymore, you understand.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.522
Al, looking at you,

08:15.662 --> 08:18.631
I now know what Valentino
would have looked like at 40.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.231
Aw, no...

08:24.371 --> 08:26.236
Gable, maybe.

08:26.373 --> 08:28.364
Hey, Al.

08:31.811 --> 08:33.302
Tighten that belt, Al.

08:33.446 --> 08:34.812
This is gonna knock
your socks off.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.847
You're gonna take off--
you're gonna fly through orbit

08:36.982 --> 08:40.179
when you meet... Anna.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.186
Anna.

08:42.322 --> 08:43.619
Anna, Anna.

08:43.756 --> 08:46.021
That's such a sweet name.

08:46.159 --> 08:47.183
Where is she, Fonz?

08:47.327 --> 08:48.453
She's pulling her motorcycle

08:48.595 --> 08:50.757
into a plot out there
in your parking lot.

08:50.897 --> 08:52.388
Motorcycle?

08:52.532 --> 08:54.296
Hey, hey, hey,
grab hold of yourselves here.

08:54.434 --> 08:55.458
It's a three-wheeler.

08:55.602 --> 08:56.728
- Oh.
- She's a meter maid.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.464
- Oh, a meter maid.
- Yeah.

08:59.606 --> 09:02.905
Well, do I call her Anna
or Officer?

09:03.042 --> 09:05.375
Al, just be yourself.

09:05.512 --> 09:07.173
Uh... wrong.

09:07.313 --> 09:08.178
Cool, Al.

09:08.314 --> 09:09.782
You got to be very, very cool.

09:09.916 --> 09:12.749
Ree-bop-a-baby!

09:14.154 --> 09:15.348
Forget cool, Al.

09:15.488 --> 09:16.785
Do what he says.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.554
Hi, I'm Al.

09:25.698 --> 09:26.757
Hi, I'm Anna.

09:26.900 --> 09:27.764
How do you do?

09:27.901 --> 09:30.233
Never gave it much thought.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.436
Would you like a cup
of coffee, uh, Officer?

09:36.576 --> 09:38.203
Oh, just call me Anna.

09:38.344 --> 09:39.368
Okay.

09:39.512 --> 09:41.674
How about a cup of coffee,
Officer Anna?

09:41.815 --> 09:42.839
(chuckles)

09:42.982 --> 09:45.679
(mouthing)

09:50.890 --> 09:53.382
You know,
people in our business...

09:53.526 --> 09:55.256
we have a lot
of things in common.

09:55.395 --> 09:57.761
Like what?

09:57.897 --> 09:59.888
Well, uh...

10:05.839 --> 10:09.036
See you tonight... Al.

10:09.175 --> 10:10.199
(Al laughs)

10:10.343 --> 10:11.674
Okay, 8:00.

10:11.811 --> 10:13.006
Don't forget, formal.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.579
Oh, right.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.512
I'll tell you something.

10:19.652 --> 10:22.178
I think that Al was pretty cool
there with Anna, huh?

10:22.322 --> 10:25.348
Fonz, the man poured
salt in his coffee.

10:25.492 --> 10:27.551
He did it with cool.

10:31.931 --> 10:33.092
Hey, Al.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.222
(Richie and Al chuckle)

10:34.367 --> 10:35.926
Well, uh...

10:36.069 --> 10:37.093
how did it go between you two?

10:37.237 --> 10:39.228
(laughs)

10:41.341 --> 10:43.241
Well, does-does Anna like you?

10:43.376 --> 10:45.367
(sighs)

10:48.381 --> 10:50.372
Well, are-are the two of you
going to be going out?

10:50.517 --> 10:52.508
(sighs)

11:04.998 --> 11:06.591
Hey, Chachi.

11:06.733 --> 11:07.859
Hey, Rich.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.434
- Seen Al around?
- I don't know.

11:09.569 --> 11:10.559
He's two hours late.

11:10.703 --> 11:12.296
I get all dressed
to see him about a job

11:12.438 --> 11:13.667
and he doesn't show.

11:13.806 --> 11:16.207
- Boy, if he hires me,
he'd better shape up. -Ha.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.971
Hey, he's two hours late after
that banquet last night, huh?

11:19.112 --> 11:20.579
Must've had a pretty good time.

11:20.713 --> 11:21.578
I'm glad to hear that.

11:21.714 --> 11:23.740
Yeah, uh... hey, look, Rich.

11:23.883 --> 11:25.943
I know you carry
a lot of clout with Al,

11:26.085 --> 11:28.111
so, uh, I want you to tell him

11:28.254 --> 11:30.553
that making me assistant manager
for the summer is a great idea.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.055
What about the garage?

11:32.191 --> 11:33.887
I'll work it out.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.359
Rich, the man needs me.

11:38.298 --> 11:39.925
Didn't work.
(chuckles)

11:40.066 --> 11:41.625
But I'll see what
I can do for you.

11:41.768 --> 11:42.860
Oh, great.

11:43.002 --> 11:44.163
Oh, excuse me, honey.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.896
All right.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.063
Here's what I want you to say.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.107
Huh?

11:49.242 --> 11:50.607
Let's see, uh...

11:50.743 --> 11:53.440
"To whom it may concern,

11:53.580 --> 11:55.980
"I have known Charles Arcola

11:56.115 --> 11:57.640
"for many years now

11:57.784 --> 11:59.115
"and found him
to be trustworthy,

11:59.252 --> 12:01.243
"loyal, courteous,

12:01.387 --> 12:04.152
and one heck of a guy.
Wah, wah, wah."

12:08.394 --> 12:09.794
Rich...

12:09.929 --> 12:11.556
Rich, the docks are a jungle.

12:11.698 --> 12:13.564
Rich, you should have
seen the foreman.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.691
The man had a tattoo
on his face.

12:18.538 --> 12:19.971
Well, what happened
to "riding the nets"

12:20.106 --> 12:21.403
and all that manly stuff?

12:21.541 --> 12:22.872
Riding the nets?

12:23.009 --> 12:24.943
Rich, they made us
load the nets!

12:25.078 --> 12:26.636
Yeah, with heavy stuff, too.

12:26.779 --> 12:28.770
Look at this.

12:29.782 --> 12:30.909
I hate the job.

12:31.050 --> 12:31.949
It's not meaningful.

12:32.085 --> 12:35.350
You got canned, huh?
(laughs)

12:35.488 --> 12:37.252
We quit by mutual consent.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.449
Hey, why don't you guys work
at the library?

12:39.592 --> 12:41.151
I hear they need bookends.

12:41.294 --> 12:42.318
(Chachi and Richie laugh)

12:44.163 --> 12:45.654
Tell Al I'll see him later.

12:45.798 --> 12:47.494
You guys are a panic.

12:47.634 --> 12:52.162
Boy, boy, we didn't even get
a chance to meet a trollop.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.364
Well, I hear they're still
taking applications

12:54.507 --> 12:56.066
at Fensick's Market.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.836
Huh. No way, man.

12:57.977 --> 12:59.468
We're gonna get some great jobs.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.104
Maybe even lifeguards:
tans, girls.

13:02.248 --> 13:03.147
Come on, Ralph.

13:03.282 --> 13:04.614
Right, Pots.

13:04.751 --> 13:07.083
Potsie, you don't even know
how to swim!

13:07.220 --> 13:09.484
I'll work the kiddie pool, huh?

13:09.622 --> 13:11.249
Well, I'm gonna work
the deep end

13:11.391 --> 13:13.450
and give the girls
Malph-to-mouth resuscitation.

13:13.593 --> 13:14.458
(both laugh)

13:14.594 --> 13:17.461
I still got it, even unemployed.

13:17.597 --> 13:18.462
Let's wash up.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.566
I'm back, Clarence.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.463
Thanks for covering for me.

13:22.602 --> 13:26.163
Hey, Al, there you are.

13:26.305 --> 13:27.933
What is this?
You're soaking wet.

13:28.074 --> 13:32.306
Oh, it was such a nice day out,
I thought I'd walk to work.

13:32.445 --> 13:36.177
Oh, you must have had a pretty
good time last night, huh?

13:36.315 --> 13:38.614
- Pretty good? It was great.
- Oh.

13:38.751 --> 13:41.186
One of the best nights
lever had in my life.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.117
That's great.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.347
Let me tell you more, huh?

13:43.489 --> 13:47.756
If I told you what we did
after the banquet...

13:47.894 --> 13:50.158
- Oh, really?
-(Al chuckles)

13:50.296 --> 13:53.357
- We both came here.
- Oh, yeah?

13:53.499 --> 13:54.523
- Alone.
-(laughs)

13:54.667 --> 13:55.896
You know what we did?

13:56.035 --> 13:58.026
No, what? What?!

13:58.171 --> 13:59.764
Made cookies.

14:03.409 --> 14:04.672
- On the first date, huh?
- Yep.

14:04.811 --> 14:07.610
(laughs)
We're going out again tonight.

14:07.747 --> 14:10.682
- Oh.
- Dinner, my pad.

14:10.817 --> 14:12.808
- That's my apartment.
- Oh, right, right.

14:12.952 --> 14:15.114
Ree-bop-a-baby!

14:15.254 --> 14:16.278
Yeah, ree-bop-a-baby!

14:17.690 --> 14:20.489
(thunder crashes)

14:28.901 --> 14:30.528
(humming)

14:33.639 --> 14:35.767
Oh...

14:35.908 --> 14:37.774
Look at that. Too much!

14:37.910 --> 14:40.709
Ah, I'll show her no mercy.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.950
Oh, Mama, Papa. (laughs)

14:47.086 --> 14:50.545
I know, right now you're saying,

14:50.690 --> 14:52.681
"What's it all about, Alfred?"

14:52.825 --> 14:55.294
Yeah. Well,
I got a date tonight.

14:55.428 --> 14:56.827
That's two in a row.

14:56.963 --> 15:00.331
Oh, I know she's not Italian,
but you're gonna love her.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.863
Ah... (chuckles)

15:04.871 --> 15:06.202
Hey...

15:06.339 --> 15:09.832
(é la Clark Gable):
Hello, Scarlett.

15:09.976 --> 15:13.207
Frankly, my dear,
I don't give a darn.

15:13.346 --> 15:16.611
Doggone, I bet I'd be
a lot of fun at parties.

15:18.017 --> 15:18.916
Hey, Ma...

in about...

16:37.029 --> 16:39.794
What, is something wrong?

16:39.932 --> 16:45.098
Oh, well, we could just skip
the music and have dinner.

16:45.238 --> 16:46.933
I see.

16:47.073 --> 16:49.439
Oh... yeah.

16:49.575 --> 16:52.442
Well, I understand, sure.

16:52.578 --> 16:55.878

18:03.015 --> 18:05.882
Al's date dumped him.

18:06.018 --> 18:07.748
What?

18:07.887 --> 18:10.322
Yeah, it was dumpamundo.

18:10.456 --> 18:12.652
Oh, my goodness.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.259
Howard, did you hear that?

18:14.393 --> 18:16.828
- Yeah.
- Dumpamundo.

18:18.464 --> 18:20.592
Just exactly what does
that mean, Arthur?

18:20.733 --> 18:22.201
Anna called me.

18:22.335 --> 18:25.065
She broke a date with Al
for tonight. Oh!

18:25.204 --> 18:27.229
Oh, man,
Al really likes her, too.

18:27.373 --> 18:30.206
Likes her?
He is nutso over her.

18:30.343 --> 18:33.801
But she, you know, she...

18:33.946 --> 18:35.641
she ain't ready for nutso yet.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.273
Richard, you should have left
well enough alone.

18:38.417 --> 18:41.046
Well, it works
with the baboons, Dad.

18:41.187 --> 18:44.418
Hey, look, baboons aside,
Richie here was trying to help.

18:44.557 --> 18:45.820
And it's appreciated.

18:45.958 --> 18:46.982
Some help.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.424
Do you know what it feels like
to be stood up?

18:49.562 --> 18:50.552
HOWARD, MARION AND RICHIE:
Yeah.

18:50.696 --> 18:53.131
FONZIE:
No.

18:53.265 --> 18:54.426
Yeah, well, I do.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.535
And it's the loneliest feeling
in the world.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.398
Hey, I can dig it, I can dig it.

18:58.537 --> 19:00.130
But look, let's go help him out,

19:00.272 --> 19:03.003
all right, before Al drowns his
sorrows in a pot of meat sauce.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.940
Yeah, yeah, you're right,
you're right.

19:05.077 --> 19:08.013
Wait a minute, boys.
Howard, you should go with them.

19:08.147 --> 19:11.139
You understand being stood up
more than anybody.

19:11.283 --> 19:13.309
Marion!

19:13.452 --> 19:16.445
I mean, Alfred needs somebody
his own age

19:16.589 --> 19:19.058
-to talk to at a time like this.
- Oh...

19:19.191 --> 19:20.557
Yeah, Mom's right, Dad.
Come on.

19:20.693 --> 19:21.853
All right, all right.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.691
I might as well give him
the benefit of my experience.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.127
Come on. We'll take the DeSoto.

19:26.265 --> 19:27.790
Oh, wait a minute, Mr. C.

19:27.933 --> 19:29.560
I feel bad enough as it is.

19:37.043 --> 19:38.704
(knocking)

19:38.844 --> 19:40.278
Who is it?

19:40.413 --> 19:42.404
It's Howard Cunningham, Al.

19:42.548 --> 19:43.640
RICHIE:
And friends.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.410
FONZIE:
Whoa!

19:48.020 --> 19:50.683
Hi. We were just driving by
and we thought

19:50.823 --> 19:53.258
we'd drop up and say, uh, hello.

19:53.392 --> 19:55.759
- Hey, how you doing, Al?
- Hello. -Hi.

19:55.895 --> 19:58.364
Well, actu... actually,
this is not a good time.

19:58.497 --> 20:00.295
Yeah, we heard, Al, we heard.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.663
That's why we came
right over here, right, Rich?

20:02.802 --> 20:04.998
Yeah. Al, listen, uh,

20:05.137 --> 20:06.503
this here,
this is not the answer.

20:06.639 --> 20:07.868
Definitely not the answer.

20:08.007 --> 20:11.670
I always put wine
in my spaghetti sauce.

20:11.811 --> 20:15.144
Spaghetti sauce. Oh.

20:15.281 --> 20:18.080
Oh, yeah, you made a whole batch
of sauce there.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.709
Well, heck. Well, not that you
need any company or anything,

20:20.853 --> 20:22.651
but as long as we're here,
we wouldn't want

20:22.788 --> 20:24.552
to let this stuff go to waste,
would we?

20:24.690 --> 20:25.680
That's true, yeah, right.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.986
Nothing is gonna go to waste.

20:28.127 --> 20:31.722
Al, look, I'm sorry that
I got you into this mess.

20:31.864 --> 20:34.060
Rich, you did the right thing.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.760
Look, matter of fact,
I'm having company tonight.

20:36.902 --> 20:39.167
Aw, come on.

20:39.305 --> 20:42.365
You don't have to say that just
to try and make me feel better.

20:42.508 --> 20:43.304
That's true.

20:43.442 --> 20:44.307
All right, all right, Al,

20:44.443 --> 20:45.911
keep a stiff upper lip.

20:46.045 --> 20:48.537
Fonz, someone's coming over.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.046
Yeah, right-right-right-
right-right.

20:50.182 --> 20:54.142
Howard, could I talk to you
for a minute alone, please?

20:54.286 --> 20:55.151
Why, sure, Al.

20:55.287 --> 20:56.186
Fellas, huh?

20:56.322 --> 20:57.289
What, are you kidding?
Sure.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.391
Well, yeah, sure,
we, we get the hint.

20:59.525 --> 21:01.459
Yeah, you don't have
to hit us over the head,

21:01.594 --> 21:03.255
let us know you want us to go.

21:03.395 --> 21:05.057
You just have to say the word...

21:05.197 --> 21:06.392
Cunningham!

21:06.532 --> 21:08.899
That's the word.

21:10.236 --> 21:12.761
Ah, they're nice guys,
but they're young

21:12.905 --> 21:14.839
and I don't think
they understand.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.669
But I think you would.

21:16.809 --> 21:19.039
You've been stood up
before, right?

21:21.213 --> 21:23.773
How does everybody know that?

21:24.750 --> 21:27.344
- Here, sit down, will you?
- Thanks.

21:27.486 --> 21:29.250
I want to explain something
to you.

21:32.491 --> 21:34.016
Did I ever...

21:34.160 --> 21:36.390
Did I ever tell you
about Rosa Coletti?

21:37.930 --> 21:40.058
It was 1934...

21:40.199 --> 21:41.166
or was it '35?

21:41.300 --> 21:43.496
It was '35, Al.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.536
Yes, you did tell me about Rosa.

21:45.671 --> 21:47.662
She, uh, eloped, didn't she?

21:47.806 --> 21:50.833
YEP, YEP, YEP, YEP, YEP-

21:50.976 --> 21:55.778
Well, ever since then,
I haven't dated much.

21:55.915 --> 21:57.507
I always was afraid
of getting hurt.

21:57.650 --> 22:02.815
But tonight I realized
I've just been harming myself.

22:02.955 --> 22:07.517
You know, last night getting
that award was terrific,

22:07.660 --> 22:13.258
but being with Anna was
the best night of my life.

22:15.367 --> 22:17.199
All right, so this one
didn't work.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.826
Well, maybe the next one will.

22:18.971 --> 22:20.302
Mm.

22:20.439 --> 22:24.672
You know, Al, there was
a Rosa Coletti in my life, too.

22:24.810 --> 22:28.406
Her name was Frances Drake,
no relation.

22:29.548 --> 22:31.517
I was about 15...

22:31.650 --> 22:32.515
or was it 16?

22:32.651 --> 22:33.914
Anyway, I remember
she called me...

22:34.053 --> 22:35.543
I'd like to hear about Frances,

22:35.688 --> 22:37.519
but I'm a little pressed
for time.

22:37.656 --> 22:39.386
Maybe we could have lunch.

22:39.525 --> 22:42.688
Oh, sure, sure. Tell me
something, who's the lucky lady?

22:42.828 --> 22:44.694
Well...
(chuckles)

22:44.830 --> 22:46.730
Mona Glickstein.

22:46.865 --> 22:49.198
- She's a widowed lady,
lives upstairs. -Oh.

22:49.335 --> 22:51.394
I've been taking out
her garbage, you know,

22:51.537 --> 22:52.902
and for a couple of years now

22:53.038 --> 22:54.131
I've been meaning
to get together,

22:54.273 --> 22:56.401
but I've always been
too shy to ask.

22:56.542 --> 22:59.034
Well, now I asked.

22:59.178 --> 23:01.738
Look, tell the guys
I'm all right, will ya?

23:01.880 --> 23:03.246
Sure. I will, Al.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.747
Well, we'll be running along.

23:04.883 --> 23:06.215
Thanks, Howard.

23:06.352 --> 23:08.548
Got a problem?

23:08.687 --> 23:10.178
No problem.

23:10.322 --> 23:12.791
Mona Glickstein is coming
to dinner.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.518
Oh. Well, night, Al.

23:14.660 --> 23:17.061
Oh, listen, don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

23:17.196 --> 23:20.029
(chuckles)
Don't worry, Rich, I wouldn't.

23:20.165 --> 23:22.430
Hey, Al, you gotta try.

23:22.568 --> 23:24.331
You always gotta try.

23:27.539 --> 23:29.098
Boom!

23:36.081 --> 23:38.050
How does Fonzie do that?

23:38.183 --> 23:40.584
I'm gonna have
to try it sometime.

23:40.719 --> 23:42.244
Just kidding, Mom.

23:42.388 --> 23:44.720
(knocking)

23:44.857 --> 23:47.155
Just a minute.

23:51.130 --> 23:55.066
