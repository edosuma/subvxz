01:27.212 --> 01:29.173
The moment of trespass.

01:29.631 --> 01:33.760
It's usually small, almost unnoticeable.

01:35.262 --> 01:38.640
Whether it's returning
a flirtatious text,

01:39.266 --> 01:41.894
holding eye contact a moment too long.

01:42.311 --> 01:45.939
Or maybe even going to a coffee
shop you know you shouldn't be at.

01:49.568 --> 01:51.862
Jean, are you really being
honest with yourself?

01:55.949 --> 01:57.409
Well, I...

01:58.368 --> 02:02.247
I did have a moment of weakness.

02:02.331 --> 02:05.459
It was brief, but...

02:07.836 --> 02:09.378
I felt the impulse.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.885
The need to escape...

02:16.136 --> 02:17.554
and just...

02:19.181 --> 02:21.683
break free of everything.

02:28.440 --> 02:31.944
I guess that's why I thought I
should come back and see you again.

02:34.663 --> 02:36.490
I'm wondering if this has anything to do

02:36.573 --> 02:38.616
with the fact that Melissa
has just been released.

02:40.869 --> 02:43.622
No, I've put that behind me.

02:45.582 --> 02:46.917
I've let it go.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.841
I do know how to keep myself in check.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.427
How to catch myself...

02:58.720 --> 03:01.515
before I'm fully on the tightrope again.

03:13.819 --> 03:15.320
Jean, it's me, Allison.

03:15.404 --> 03:18.615
Please call me back, 646-555-0174.

03:18.699 --> 03:22.202
Please, I really need to talk to you.
Soon, please.

03:32.546 --> 03:36.967
Uh, yeah, so, she's been doing
really well with her recovery.

03:37.634 --> 03:40.345
Um, we went to a meeting just last week.

03:44.433 --> 03:47.102
Sorry, it's...

03:47.686 --> 03:49.271
It's a lot for me to process.

03:49.980 --> 03:52.441
Her mother's concerned she's
a potential suicide risk.

03:52.524 --> 03:54.109
She's not suicidal.

03:55.819 --> 03:59.114
Do you know where she was last
staying since she left her mom's?

04:01.074 --> 04:02.201
Um...

04:02.659 --> 04:05.787
she was at her friend
Amber's for a few days.

04:06.330 --> 04:09.124
And after that, um...

04:10.792 --> 04:11.960
her ex-boyfriend's.

04:12.461 --> 04:15.088
- Name of the boyfriend?
- Ex-boyfriend.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.505
Tom Devins.

04:16.839 --> 04:21.094
He's actually responsible
for a lot of her drug use.

04:21.178 --> 04:24.681
And he's been violent
with her before, also.

04:28.560 --> 04:31.480
If I can get a copy of your
notes, that would be helpful.

04:31.980 --> 04:36.026
Uh, I'm not sure how
comfortable I am with that.

04:36.109 --> 04:40.864
It's standard protocol to discuss
it with the patient first.

04:41.448 --> 04:42.616
Yeah, I understand.

04:43.367 --> 04:46.245
But anything that helps us track
her behavior is very useful.

04:48.163 --> 04:49.665
Or we could just court order it.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.625
Anything I can do to help.

05:02.553 --> 05:03.720
That was it.

05:04.897 --> 05:05.973
I, uh...

05:06.056 --> 05:08.433
I gave him my notes. I
told him about Tom.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.812
It was pretty straightforward.

05:11.895 --> 05:14.314
He was in the waiting room
a few weeks ago, right?

05:14.398 --> 05:15.399
Yeah.

05:16.692 --> 05:20.070
His body language, his
anger, I shoud've...

05:20.153 --> 05:21.780
I should have reported it back then.

05:21.864 --> 05:24.032
Well, the police will handle it.

05:24.783 --> 05:25.801
But...

05:26.285 --> 05:27.871
I'm still unclear, Jean.

05:28.090 --> 05:29.746
I couldn't have predicted
that Allison...

05:29.830 --> 05:31.331
No, not about Allison.

05:32.124 --> 05:33.125
About you.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.462
Detective Kelly mentioned on the
phone that Allison's mother believes

05:37.546 --> 05:39.256
she's emotionally unstable.

05:39.339 --> 05:42.426
That's a huge departure from
what you've said in supervision.

05:42.509 --> 05:45.929
I... I just wouldn't characterize
her as emotionally unstable.

05:46.013 --> 05:49.016
Yes, she's in recovery, but
she's making progress.

05:49.099 --> 05:50.934
She's really trying. I told you this.

05:51.602 --> 05:54.730
I'm wondering how attached
you've become to this girl.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.149
I'm worried it's a pattern.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.151
Look, Allison's an addict.

05:59.568 --> 06:03.197
They're manipulative and charismatic
and often the best liars.

06:03.280 --> 06:07.201
But my only error here is that I
couldn't perceive the fact that maybe,

06:07.284 --> 06:10.204
maybe she was lying
to me, and that's it.

06:10.287 --> 06:11.872
I'm not involved with this.

06:12.456 --> 06:15.918
And I'm certainly not breaking
any professional boundaries.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.895
I heard you been looking for me.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.066
Yeah, I was, but it's nothing.
Don't worry...

06:39.149 --> 06:43.111
No, no, no, no. See, now
I want to talk to you.

06:43.612 --> 06:45.864
- What is it?
- Allison.

06:46.782 --> 06:50.869
See, she slept over the other
night, and now she's gone, right?

06:50.953 --> 06:52.329
She disappeared like that.

06:52.955 --> 06:54.915
I thought maybe you'd
know something about it

06:54.998 --> 06:56.917
since you're all
buddy-buddy with her now.

06:58.627 --> 07:00.212
I'm supposed to believe you?

07:00.629 --> 07:04.299
I might be an asshole, all right?
But I'm not a fucking kidnapper.

07:06.093 --> 07:09.012
You gotta admit, though, she
had you so focused on me,

07:09.134 --> 07:10.595
that you didn't even think that maybe

07:10.620 --> 07:12.387
she was the one who was
fucking psychotic.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.244
I'm sure she fed you that bullshit
about her mom's cancer, too, right?

07:17.771 --> 07:20.023
Just hope she doesn't
sell you out, too, lady.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.115
It's beautiful.

08:12.034 --> 08:15.329
The blue. Yes, I love the blue.

08:16.580 --> 08:17.789
Um, Alexis?

08:24.338 --> 08:26.089
- Hey.
- Hey, um...

08:26.173 --> 08:27.716
Could you close the door?

08:35.432 --> 08:36.491
What's going on?

08:37.058 --> 08:40.812
I don't know. Actually,
I really don't know.

08:42.648 --> 08:44.566
Can I do something?

08:45.525 --> 08:47.986
I have to go and pick up
Dolly from school today.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.238
So can you just cancel
the meeting with Allen?

08:50.321 --> 08:53.658
Michael. I mean, can I do anything?

08:54.951 --> 08:55.952
I wish that you could.

08:57.538 --> 08:58.555
Me, too.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.167
Thanks. Hey, I am...

09:03.669 --> 09:05.712
really glad that you're
back at your desk.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.465
I hope that's okay to say.

09:31.613 --> 09:33.991
Hey, this is Sam. Leave a message.

09:36.827 --> 09:38.453
Sam, it's Jean again.

09:38.537 --> 09:41.373
Uh, I really need to speak to you.

09:41.456 --> 09:43.166
Can you call me back, please?

09:43.500 --> 09:46.795
It's important. Thanks.

10:02.811 --> 10:04.062
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:11.904 --> 10:13.822
- Well, that's nice.
- Mm-hmm.

10:14.907 --> 10:16.575
I'm happy to see you.

10:17.492 --> 10:20.204
Believe me, I could use
the escape right now.

10:23.707 --> 10:26.627
I love it, your place.

10:27.377 --> 10:28.412
Thanks.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.970
Your niece looks exactly like you.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.389
We get that a lot.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.106
Can I get you a drink?

10:48.982 --> 10:51.360
- Sure.
- Bourbon okay?

10:51.443 --> 10:52.528
Yeah, great.

10:56.198 --> 10:59.576
Oh, shit, can you grab some ice, please?

11:00.077 --> 11:01.161
Sure.

11:05.541 --> 11:08.001
- Fuck.
- What?

11:08.877 --> 11:10.712
This I wasn't expecting.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.093
- It's not mine.
- Well, then, whose is it?

11:17.511 --> 11:18.679
I don't know.

11:20.472 --> 11:24.309
I, um, had a friend staying here.
She has issues with drugs,

11:24.393 --> 11:28.689
and I didn't know she was still using.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.323
I don't want to think
about that right now.

11:38.907 --> 11:41.451
I just want to focus on you.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.292
How are you feeling after the other day?

11:51.003 --> 11:52.129
Better.

11:57.342 --> 11:59.344
You know, I was thinking about Sam.

12:01.430 --> 12:02.931
What does he look like?

12:04.224 --> 12:06.809
- Do you have a picture?
- Why do you care?

12:07.561 --> 12:10.189
Curious what kind of
guy you like to fuck.

12:10.272 --> 12:11.690
Oh, really?

12:14.276 --> 12:17.196
- Does that turn you on?
- Maybe.

12:18.822 --> 12:20.449
You like picturing that?

12:32.503 --> 12:36.131
Here, you can see Emily, too.

12:36.965 --> 12:39.343
He's cute, I guess.

12:42.679 --> 12:43.764
Oh.

12:44.681 --> 12:45.849
What?

12:47.058 --> 12:49.852
I guess he's having some kind
of engagement party tonight.

12:57.694 --> 13:00.321
Sorry, I just, I didn't know
that was happening tonight.

13:00.405 --> 13:02.533
Hey, don't apologize.

13:02.991 --> 13:05.577
I mean, you guys had a long history,

13:06.160 --> 13:08.746
and you obviously cared
about each other, too.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.000
It's normal.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.461
Yeah.

13:17.631 --> 13:18.799
Where is it?

13:22.344 --> 13:24.471
It's just some restaurant downtown.

13:24.555 --> 13:27.474
Look, I'm telling you, I
really don't give a shit.

13:28.392 --> 13:30.060
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

13:32.688 --> 13:34.940
Not even curious just a little bit?

13:46.076 --> 13:48.078
Maybe it'll be a turn on.

14:11.727 --> 14:13.562
I hope no one recognizes me.

14:14.188 --> 14:16.106
That's all part of the fun, isn't it?

14:17.274 --> 14:20.444
You're right. You're not that pure.

14:33.165 --> 14:34.499
That's them, right?

14:46.094 --> 14:48.096
Ugh, she's so vanilla.

14:48.597 --> 14:51.225
Not everyone could be as
adventurous as you are.

14:51.725 --> 14:52.893
Whatever.

14:56.772 --> 15:00.317
Should I try to get closer?
See if I can hear something?

15:00.776 --> 15:02.027
You're crazy.

15:02.110 --> 15:04.238
Why? No one knows who I am.

15:07.157 --> 15:08.867
I can try to get a picture.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.537
Hold on a second.

15:12.287 --> 15:14.414
Let me use yours. Mine's dead.

16:10.554 --> 16:12.472
Must be hard for you to see that.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.224
Yeah, it's a little weird, for sure.

16:15.558 --> 16:18.644
You guys were in a serious,
co-dependent relationship.

16:20.730 --> 16:25.276
Sure. We were lost in our own
little world for a while, I guess.

16:25.359 --> 16:28.321
Don't you think that you
were maybe using him?

16:29.072 --> 16:30.157
Controlling?

16:30.532 --> 16:32.910
I mean, come on, convincing
him to get a tattoo?

16:34.119 --> 16:37.289
Maybe Emily just loves him
for who he really is.

16:37.873 --> 16:39.499
How do you know he has a tattoo?

16:42.920 --> 16:46.089
You told me the other night, remember?

16:48.800 --> 16:49.801
Hmm.

17:05.775 --> 17:06.809
Look.

17:09.987 --> 17:12.031
Oh, fuck me.

17:13.909 --> 17:15.493
You should go talk to him.

17:17.246 --> 17:18.579
Are you crazy?

17:19.080 --> 17:21.583
- Here, now?
- Yeah.

17:23.752 --> 17:27.631
Go on, tell him how insane this is,
and that you're worried about him.

17:28.048 --> 17:30.801
Why would I do that in the
middle of his engagement party?

17:31.218 --> 17:35.180
Because you said it yourself,
he shouldn't be with her.

17:36.974 --> 17:38.684
Maybe you can get through to him.

17:40.269 --> 17:42.646
Why do you want me to
be with Sam so much?

17:44.481 --> 17:46.358
I just think he's good for you.

17:46.859 --> 17:49.862
You said he's reliable, dependent.

17:51.154 --> 17:52.990
You get to be honest with him.

17:56.535 --> 17:58.745
You know how to make him feel good.

18:48.962 --> 18:52.674
- You got in late.
- Yeah, it was a rough night.

18:56.178 --> 18:58.180
I can't believe we still
live in this house.

18:58.263 --> 18:59.306
Hmm.

18:59.389 --> 19:01.016
You're the one who chose it.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.268
Maybe I've changed.

19:29.669 --> 19:30.686
Oh!

19:50.065 --> 19:51.859
Excuse me, miss!

19:55.737 --> 19:56.947
Hey, are you Alexis Wright?

19:57.781 --> 20:00.826
Um, yeah. How can I help you?

20:03.537 --> 20:04.788
Did you write this?

20:09.042 --> 20:10.127
Yeah.

20:10.919 --> 20:13.130
- You know Diane?
- Diane who?

20:13.213 --> 20:14.273
Hart.

20:14.406 --> 20:16.925
- Doesn't sound familiar...
- She's saying that she wrote this.

20:17.009 --> 20:18.927
So either you're a
plagiarist, or she is.

20:19.009 --> 20:21.387
I don't know what you're talking about.

20:21.889 --> 20:24.224
Who are you? How did you
even get this address?

20:24.641 --> 20:25.809
Your Linkedln.

20:26.434 --> 20:28.877
You can find anything on the Internet.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.356
Michael Holloway's office.

20:32.982 --> 20:36.485
Hey, Jean. Yeah, okay, go ahead.

20:38.739 --> 20:39.756
Yea...

20:40.866 --> 20:43.619
Um... okay.

20:46.872 --> 20:47.873
Hey!

20:53.502 --> 20:57.965
"Dear Mom, I'm so sorry for
all that has transpired."

20:58.759 --> 21:01.637
I know I haven't been able to
see you as much as you'd like,

21:02.262 --> 21:06.308
but I love you and value you so much.

21:07.935 --> 21:10.604
It's hard for me to bring
this up in person,

21:11.230 --> 21:13.148
and it might be better
to just not mention it,

21:13.232 --> 21:16.151
but please know that I love you.

21:17.319 --> 21:18.529
"Love, Rebecca."

21:19.655 --> 21:20.739
Oh...

21:21.532 --> 21:24.284
That's really lovely, Claire.

21:24.868 --> 21:27.704
I was so upset when she canceled on me,

21:28.205 --> 21:29.831
and really thought it was over.

21:30.249 --> 21:31.708
And then I get this.

21:32.584 --> 21:33.627
I don't know.

21:34.670 --> 21:37.506
I guess Howard's shining
down on me, after all.

21:40.551 --> 21:41.802
You know, Claire...

21:43.554 --> 21:46.515
I think I've been preoccupied lately

21:47.307 --> 21:51.228
and perhaps not been present for
you in the ways I want to be.

21:51.311 --> 21:55.691
So, I want to apologize
if I've been hard on you.

21:55.983 --> 21:57.985
No, what are you talking about?

21:58.068 --> 22:00.153
Jean, you've been terrific, terrific...

22:00.236 --> 22:03.280
No, I haven't, but I'm
gonna change that.

22:03.447 --> 22:07.993
I think it's possible that I was
over-identifying with Rebecca,

22:08.078 --> 22:10.956
'cause I have a tough
relationship with my mother.

22:11.582 --> 22:13.917
And you know, that voice
that gets into your head,

22:14.001 --> 22:16.336
you can't... you can't shut it down.

22:16.837 --> 22:22.217
And you don't like what it says,
but it makes you want to rebel.

22:23.427 --> 22:25.637
You know, when I was just a little girl,

22:26.305 --> 22:27.556
I thought...

22:29.474 --> 22:32.769
I want to just strike a match
and burn the house down.

22:34.980 --> 22:37.816
But, of course, I would never do that,

22:37.900 --> 22:42.905
but family, emotions are intense.

22:44.031 --> 22:45.490
Jean, I'm really sorry.

22:47.367 --> 22:50.031
It's just... even I
have to struggle with

22:50.084 --> 22:52.291
how much I have to hide from my mom.

22:53.415 --> 22:55.584
So maybe it's the same with Rebecca.

23:00.756 --> 23:03.425
So, the weirdest thing just happened.

23:04.218 --> 23:09.556
This random girl comes to my desk
earlier, asking all kinds of questions.

23:09.640 --> 23:13.560
She claims someone named Diane
Hart was plagiarizing my story.

23:13.644 --> 23:15.270
It was really bizarre.

23:17.689 --> 23:19.107
And Dolly's school again,

23:19.191 --> 23:21.485
they want to confirm
Jean's speech on bullying.

23:22.528 --> 23:24.087
Said they've been trying to reach her.

23:26.073 --> 23:27.074
Oh, right, yeah.

23:27.157 --> 23:28.951
She didn't mention anything about a...

23:30.118 --> 23:31.787
a speech, go figure.

23:33.205 --> 23:34.289
You okay?

23:50.347 --> 23:52.516
I was a real dick to you after Texas.

23:52.599 --> 23:54.935
- And I'm not a dick.
- I know you're not.

23:57.771 --> 23:59.273
I think, maybe...

24:01.358 --> 24:04.695
I've been being nice
to the wrong people.

24:08.156 --> 24:09.449
Michael...

24:13.412 --> 24:16.915
You worked so hard to
disprove the rumors.

24:16.999 --> 24:18.625
'Cause I'm a fucking idiot.

24:25.132 --> 24:26.675
I'm seeing someone.

24:31.680 --> 24:36.018
Okay, right. I'm sorry.

24:36.518 --> 24:37.644
It's okay.

24:39.855 --> 24:42.232
Uh, no explanation needed.

25:15.057 --> 25:17.351
You know, when I was still at Fordham,

25:18.644 --> 25:21.230
just when all this shit
started to take over,

25:23.106 --> 25:26.276
I used to sit in the park
over there and swing...

25:27.819 --> 25:29.238
for, like, hours.

25:32.741 --> 25:34.952
It was the only place I felt safe.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.632
Faster! Faster, faster!

25:50.717 --> 25:52.553
Stacey, Stacey, Stacey, look!

25:54.429 --> 25:55.430
Mommy!

25:55.889 --> 25:57.057
Hey, sweetie.

25:57.140 --> 26:00.143
I got finished early, so I
thought I'd surprise you.

26:01.186 --> 26:03.939
Now you go upstairs and get
started with your homework, okay?

26:04.022 --> 26:06.441
- Already?
- Yeah, I'll be right up.

26:06.775 --> 26:07.776
Thanks.

26:36.574 --> 26:38.811
We're sorry, you have reached a number

26:38.836 --> 26:41.588
that has been disconnected
or is no longer in service.

26:56.491 --> 26:59.536
Hi, Detective Kelly, this
is Jean Holloway again.

26:59.620 --> 27:02.706
I'm just calling to see if you
have any more information

27:02.789 --> 27:04.875
on my patient Allison Adams.

27:05.334 --> 27:07.794
If you could call me as
soon as you get this.

27:07.878 --> 27:10.422
Thanks. Bye.

27:27.356 --> 27:28.524
We need to talk.

27:29.189 --> 27:30.357
I know.

27:32.611 --> 27:33.612
Good.

27:35.155 --> 27:37.449
Good. Is Dolly upstairs?

27:37.533 --> 27:41.119
- Yeah, she's... she's fine.
- Okay.

27:42.663 --> 27:44.915
I'm, uh, I'm concerned.

27:46.166 --> 27:47.292
Okay.

27:48.085 --> 27:51.797
I recognize this, all of it.

27:52.548 --> 27:54.132
And I don't like it.

27:54.216 --> 27:55.217
I know...

27:57.094 --> 27:58.637
I know that you're lying.

27:59.179 --> 28:02.182
I don't know why, or
what you're lying about,

28:02.266 --> 28:05.853
but I can see it, I know.

28:06.603 --> 28:09.523
Okay, look...

28:12.568 --> 28:15.904
I just, I need your help right now.

28:15.988 --> 28:17.698
I need you to stick with me.

28:18.407 --> 28:19.575
Honey...

28:20.367 --> 28:25.205
I'm in over my head,
and, um, I'm scared.

28:26.206 --> 28:31.962
There's a car outside. It's
been parked there all day.

28:32.045 --> 28:34.214
What do you mean? What car? What...

28:40.053 --> 28:41.346
There's nobody out there.

28:42.012 --> 28:44.056
It... it was. It was...

28:45.184 --> 28:46.935
It was a gray car right there.

28:47.853 --> 28:49.496
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

28:50.314 --> 28:52.149
- I don't know, I don't know...
- Hey, Jean.

28:52.232 --> 28:53.525
- It's...
- Jean.

28:57.196 --> 28:59.573
Okay, I did something...

29:01.575 --> 29:03.368
that I know you won't agree with, but...

29:05.035 --> 29:07.496
In fact, it's hard for
me to even admit, but...

29:08.123 --> 29:14.046
I have a patient, this young girl, and
she's got this violent ex-boyfriend,

29:14.129 --> 29:18.091
and he's involved with drugs,
and she's involved, and...

29:18.842 --> 29:21.803
and she has a mother who
won't see her, and...

29:22.763 --> 29:25.265
she just needed a place
to stay for a few days.

29:25.349 --> 29:27.392
And I didn't want her to
end up on the streets.

29:27.474 --> 29:30.227
- Right.
- So I wanted to just be there for her.

29:31.230 --> 29:32.272
And now...

29:33.899 --> 29:37.277
Now she's missing. She's...
she's missing.

29:38.445 --> 29:40.113
The detective is calling me.

29:40.195 --> 29:42.614
I don't... I don't know.

29:43.909 --> 29:46.912
Imagine if this was Dolly.
Imagine, it's just...

29:53.252 --> 29:54.378
Okay.

30:02.594 --> 30:06.431
And so I let her go to 309.

30:10.727 --> 30:13.021
- Wait, 309?
- Yeah, I kept it.

30:13.687 --> 30:18.025
I didn't ever use it or sleep there.
I just never gave it up.

30:18.652 --> 30:19.728
Wait.

30:21.530 --> 30:23.198
You kept it? Why would you keep it?

30:23.280 --> 30:25.649
And you told me that you got rid
of it like eight years ago.

30:26.033 --> 30:28.368
- I guess I was scared, I just...
- Of what?

30:30.497 --> 30:34.293
I don't know. Of losing it. I...

30:35.836 --> 30:38.046
I don't know, of losing myself.

30:38.462 --> 30:41.340
Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?

30:41.425 --> 30:44.386
You don't think that I'm
afraid of losing myself?

30:44.469 --> 30:47.431
You are so fucking selfish!

30:47.514 --> 30:49.558
- Please, Dolly...
- No, no, no, no, stop it, stop it!

30:49.641 --> 30:52.394
Did you ever actually think about me?
And Dolly?

30:52.477 --> 30:55.063
How this would affect any of us?

30:55.147 --> 30:58.442
The fact that you can
never actually commit,

30:58.525 --> 31:00.068
and this insane recklessness.

31:00.152 --> 31:01.804
Jean, I have stuck by you

31:01.835 --> 31:03.110
- through everything!
- Please stop.

31:03.113 --> 31:05.032
Shut up! With your mom, with Melissa.

31:05.115 --> 31:07.159
Maybe she wasn't as crazy
as you made her out to be.

31:07.242 --> 31:09.862
Maybe you manipulated her,
got under her skin, huh?

31:09.924 --> 31:11.870
Maybe she wasn't as
fucked up as you thought.

31:11.872 --> 31:14.291
And who is this woman who
comes into my office

31:14.374 --> 31:16.123
- and says she knows
- Honey, please, stop!

31:16.126 --> 31:20.172
Someone named Diane Hart who
plagiarized my assistant's story?

31:20.255 --> 31:22.424
What the fuck is wrong with you?

31:23.509 --> 31:24.885
Does this make you feel good?

31:24.968 --> 31:27.763
Does it make you feel more free
to manipulate people like this?

31:27.846 --> 31:29.932
That you're so powerful?

31:31.975 --> 31:33.393
Fuck this.

31:40.901 --> 31:42.778
Fuck this.

32:26.238 --> 32:28.407
Jean. What are you doing here?

32:33.120 --> 32:34.621
Oh, honey.

32:37.999 --> 32:39.668
It's okay, okay.

32:41.461 --> 32:42.838
Okay.

32:46.216 --> 32:47.634
It's all right.

32:50.929 --> 32:53.473
You just have to tell
Michael you'll give it up.

32:54.431 --> 32:56.016
And do whatever it takes.

32:57.227 --> 33:00.522
- That's all he needs to hear.
- Yeah.

33:01.023 --> 33:02.691
So, he feels hurt.

33:07.571 --> 33:09.281
You sound like the therapist.

33:09.698 --> 33:11.867
Well, unlike a therapist,

33:11.950 --> 33:16.622
I would argue that you
can then disregard it...

33:18.790 --> 33:21.919
and figure out what you
actually want to do.

33:25.130 --> 33:28.592
Why didn't you force me to give
it up after all these years?

33:29.468 --> 33:31.512
Because I knew you needed it.

33:34.806 --> 33:41.480
And I thought better that it be an
apartment than... a person, hmm?

33:44.358 --> 33:46.610
Well, actually, I blame your father.

33:49.112 --> 33:53.200
Creating a world of
secrecy all around you.

33:54.910 --> 33:56.703
And me, as a matter of fact.

34:00.499 --> 34:03.460
I have to go down to the
basement to look at some stuff.

34:04.670 --> 34:06.839
- Is that okay?
- Okay.

35:16.491 --> 35:19.369
Diane. Diane Hart.

35:20.245 --> 35:26.210
I'm... a journalist. I'm a journalist.

35:26.960 --> 35:30.005
Relationship status, single.

35:31.131 --> 35:35.511
Address, 309 West 81st Street.

35:36.678 --> 35:41.141
Future plans... unknown.

37:09.855 --> 37:11.648
I do love you.

37:14.151 --> 37:15.527
So much.

37:20.949 --> 37:22.618
Upstairs, please, sweetie.

37:22.701 --> 37:23.827
No!

37:23.911 --> 37:26.371
Dolly, go upstairs and get ready now.

37:27.664 --> 37:30.000
- Daddy!
- Now.

37:30.542 --> 37:33.170
Hmm, ba-boing!

37:37.966 --> 37:39.635
I want the key to 309.

37:41.762 --> 37:42.779
Why?

37:43.388 --> 37:45.474
Are you really asking
me that at this point?

38:48.662 --> 38:51.456
Thanks for coming, Sam.
I'm happy to see you.

38:51.957 --> 38:53.959
I figured I owed you that, at least.

38:54.710 --> 38:58.547
Yeah, I'm glad. I didn't like
how things ended last time.

38:58.628 --> 39:01.005
Yeah, I'm not the best at goodbyes.

39:01.550 --> 39:02.759
Neither am I.

39:03.510 --> 39:09.057
And look, if you want to process out
of therapy, that's your choice.

39:09.141 --> 39:10.893
That's fine, of course.

39:12.769 --> 39:13.937
But...

39:15.981 --> 39:20.360
I do feel an obligation to
share something with you.

39:23.822 --> 39:25.365
Sidney contacted me.

39:28.660 --> 39:29.828
What?

39:29.909 --> 39:32.412
She told me you were getting engaged.

39:33.165 --> 39:34.791
I think she's worried about you.

39:35.125 --> 39:37.669
Wait, she said that? You spoke to her?

39:37.753 --> 39:41.548
No, it was an e-mail, which I
didn't respond to, of course.

39:41.921 --> 39:44.173
How did she find you? She
doesn't even know who you are.

39:44.257 --> 39:47.552
Well, I don't know. Does
she have your password?

39:47.638 --> 39:49.806
Did she get into your
emails, your contacts?

39:49.888 --> 39:52.015
I can't believe she
reached out like that.

39:52.100 --> 39:54.645
Maybe she doesn't want
you to make a mistake.

39:55.145 --> 39:57.606
No, she just wants to
bulldoze my happiness

39:57.689 --> 39:59.354
now that I'm with
Emily, and she's alone.

39:59.358 --> 40:01.818
Sam, you sure you should be doing this?

40:01.902 --> 40:03.278
Getting engaged to Emily?

40:03.362 --> 40:05.614
I know you'll probably say
it's reckless and impulsive,

40:05.697 --> 40:06.668
and it's just a Band-Aid,

40:06.693 --> 40:08.043
and all the other very smart,

40:08.075 --> 40:09.823
- rational advice, but I just don't care.
- You're an adult.

40:09.824 --> 40:12.493
- It's your decision.
- But I know what you're thinking.

40:14.162 --> 40:16.164
Maybe that's not what I'm thinking.

40:18.168 --> 40:22.506
You know, my husband's a lawyer, and
we're actually not that different

40:22.589 --> 40:23.674
from you and Sidney.

40:25.676 --> 40:27.135
Maybe that's why...

40:29.763 --> 40:31.098
I'm invested.

40:43.068 --> 40:45.904
You know, the other night, we had a...

40:46.905 --> 40:47.990
a party

40:48.824 --> 40:51.368
to celebrate the engagement.

40:54.037 --> 40:57.332
And I swear for a second I
thought I saw Sidney there.

40:59.084 --> 41:00.878
It freaked me out.

41:01.378 --> 41:04.590
It made me wonder if I'm always gonna
be chasing the dream, you know?

41:06.008 --> 41:07.259
The fantasy.

41:08.802 --> 41:11.263
But I think it's good that
I'm not mad for Emily.

41:11.972 --> 41:15.267
That I don't lose my head,
that I choose something real.

41:16.852 --> 41:22.357
Well, Sam, I don't want you to settle.
You should have your dream.

41:24.401 --> 41:25.527
But if you...

41:26.486 --> 41:29.907
if you really feel that connection,
that excitement with Emily,

41:29.990 --> 41:32.910
then who am I to tell you
how much time you need?

41:34.786 --> 41:39.541
And the fact that you
actually are over Sidney?

41:40.167 --> 41:41.835
Well, that means something.

41:43.128 --> 41:48.884
But you know, for what it's worth, maybe
Sidney's not as bad as we thought.

41:50.302 --> 41:53.514
I mean, she clearly cares
about you a great deal.

41:55.807 --> 41:57.309
You know, sometimes...

41:59.478 --> 42:03.398
it just takes one look at someone to
know that's what you really want.

43:16.886 --> 43:19.097
What the fuck are you doing here?

43:20.181 --> 43:21.849
I just really wanted to talk to you.

43:22.519 --> 43:24.563
You never even visited.

43:24.644 --> 43:26.354
I wanted to.

43:26.440 --> 43:29.276
No one understood. You know that, right?

43:30.110 --> 43:32.821
They said I fabricated all of
it, that you're a professional,

43:32.905 --> 43:35.240
and I'm some un-credible source.

43:35.741 --> 43:37.409
You made me look crazy.

43:37.868 --> 43:39.703
You took out a fucking
restraining order?

43:39.786 --> 43:41.413
It just went too far.

43:41.788 --> 43:43.415
I couldn't be a part of it.

43:43.999 --> 43:46.335
But that doesn't mean I stopped caring.

43:46.710 --> 43:50.380
I followed your progress, I
checked up on you all the time.

43:50.461 --> 43:53.256
- And I promise...
- No, you have no idea what it's like

43:53.634 --> 43:58.388
to be watched by everyone, prodded,
like nothing you say is true.

43:58.469 --> 44:01.180
You're just a worthless,
fucking parasite.

44:01.850 --> 44:06.396
Look, I know you don't trust me, but...

44:08.271 --> 44:11.732
I'll regain it. It's important to me.

44:18.909 --> 44:20.202
Do you still have it?

44:24.623 --> 44:27.334
Yeah, I never took it off.

44:30.128 --> 44:34.091
I missed you, Jean. I
missed you so much.

44:40.764 --> 44:42.683
I missed you, too, Melissa.

44:50.524 --> 44:51.558
Hey.

44:53.735 --> 44:56.321
It's gonna be okay, I promise.

45:26.435 --> 45:29.021
Uh, hey, Catherine,
it's Michael calling.

45:29.104 --> 45:31.690
I'm sorry that it took me
so long to call you back.

45:41.074 --> 45:42.618
Hi, Detective Kelly?

45:42.701 --> 45:45.037
This is Jean Holloway
returning your call.

45:45.120 --> 45:47.539
Yeah, so I met with Tom Devins.

45:48.207 --> 45:50.876
He hasn't seen her. He was
actually pretty concerned.

45:52.211 --> 45:55.255
He did mention an apartment
on the Upper West Side.

45:56.298 --> 45:58.175
Apparently she was staying there.

45:59.134 --> 46:02.638
I'll go check it out, if I can
ever get out of here tonight.

48:10.224 --> 48:11.225
Hey.

48:11.767 --> 48:14.645
- Dolly's inside.
- Yeah.

48:15.103 --> 48:18.273
I went there. I saw it.

48:20.275 --> 48:21.360
Okay.

48:27.366 --> 48:30.452
I don't know what the
fuck you expect me to do.

48:33.872 --> 48:36.542
This is not who I want to be, Jean.

48:39.127 --> 48:41.380
Look, I can't lose you...

48:43.257 --> 48:44.383
or Dolly.

48:45.801 --> 48:48.428
It doesn't compare, nothing compares.

48:52.474 --> 48:55.394
And I promise, I'm gonna be all in.

48:57.312 --> 48:59.606
I'll commit to you entirely.

49:04.066 --> 49:05.818
I'll give up everything.

49:09.405 --> 49:11.866
Please believe me, Michael.

49:34.766 --> 49:38.353
She's an active member of
our community and our PTA,

49:38.896 --> 49:42.024
and she's also an expert on a
subject that affects all of us.

49:55.370 --> 49:59.416
Some of you already know that I'm
a cognitive behavioral therapist,

49:59.499 --> 50:02.030
and so I've been asked
tonight to speak about

50:02.112 --> 50:04.345
how to prevent bullying in schools.

50:05.130 --> 50:06.965
But it's really not that simple.

50:08.091 --> 50:11.512
So, I don't want to rattle
off statistics here.

50:12.304 --> 50:16.141
I want to address the
root causes of bullying,

50:17.267 --> 50:20.521
and talk about what
motivates that behavior.

50:26.276 --> 50:29.947
It often comes from a
deep-seated lack of stability.

50:36.245 --> 50:38.914
A ground that was never really solid.

50:39.703 --> 50:43.165
And yet, unsurprisingly,
those who've been bullied

50:43.669 --> 50:47.714
are more than likely going to
become bullies themselves.

50:55.013 --> 50:56.890
They want to inflict pain on others,

50:56.974 --> 51:00.853
mostly because they don't
want to feel the pain.

51:12.406 --> 51:17.035
Perhaps they try to distract you
through intimidation or lies,

51:17.703 --> 51:23.375
so you don't see their truth,
their guilt, their own shame.

51:25.836 --> 51:29.173
It's deeply embedded from their history,

51:30.215 --> 51:34.094
their experiences,
even their upbringing.

51:35.888 --> 51:38.140
And, lastly, there's the
ones who want power,

51:38.223 --> 51:42.060
because they just don't want
to feel powerless any longer.

51:48.317 --> 51:49.735
They need an outlet.

51:53.780 --> 51:55.866
To really have power,

51:56.783 --> 51:59.745
one must have it over
something or someone.

52:06.251 --> 52:10.506
But it's never really about
that person, that situation.

52:16.008 --> 52:19.136
Those people who truly desire power...

52:19.723 --> 52:22.809
are actually only trying
to control one thing...

52:27.227 --> 52:28.312
themselves.
