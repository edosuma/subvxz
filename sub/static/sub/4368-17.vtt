00:04.988 --> 00:06.988
The government
has a secret system--

00:07.290 --> 00:10.992
A machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:13.174 --> 00:15.876
_

00:18.499 --> 00:19.933
Name's Root.

00:19.935 --> 00:22.302
She's a hacker,
extortionist, murderer.

00:22.304 --> 00:23.570
She hacks human beings

00:23.572 --> 00:25.305
as easily
as she hacks computers.

00:25.307 --> 00:26.840
I don't wanna
control their machine.

00:26.842 --> 00:28.142
I just want to set it free.

00:28.144 --> 00:29.643
I already did.

00:29.645 --> 00:31.077
The machine's
given me a mission.

00:31.079 --> 00:32.412
Things are evolving.

00:32.414 --> 00:33.746
You say you're an interface,

00:33.748 --> 00:35.515
your eyes and your ears
are your ports,

00:35.517 --> 00:37.016
we can put a stop to that.

00:37.018 --> 00:38.751
I wish you'd listened.

00:38.753 --> 00:40.787
Then the drives would have never
fallen into the wrong hands.

00:40.789 --> 00:42.355
Decima Technologies.

00:42.357 --> 00:43.590
My Samaritan,

00:43.592 --> 00:46.025
you are destined
for great things.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.324
_

00:50.325 --> 00:52.894
_

00:58.772 --> 01:00.639
<i>Hey, new fish,</i>

01:00.641 --> 01:02.075
you want a tip?

01:02.077 --> 01:04.075
No, thanks.

01:04.078 --> 01:07.446
That's too bad, 'cause you're
getting the whole thing.

01:12.352 --> 01:13.519
Hey!

01:17.225 --> 01:20.125
Go check it out.

01:20.127 --> 01:22.393
Ma'am, hello?

01:22.395 --> 01:25.396
Are you okay?

01:25.398 --> 01:28.700
- I'm fine. Thanks for asking.
- Aah!

01:28.702 --> 01:30.368
Get out there.
We've got a problem.

01:30.370 --> 01:32.104
Go get 'em, biggie.

01:32.106 --> 01:34.372
<i>Show 'em what you got.</i>

01:34.374 --> 01:36.523
<i>You, hands in the
air-- Get down on the-- Aah!</i>

01:37.444 --> 01:40.811
<i>Oh, what have we here?</i>

01:40.813 --> 01:43.147
Hey, baby.
I want a piece of that.

01:43.149 --> 01:45.583
Hi, Billy.

01:45.585 --> 01:47.485
Wanna get outta here?

01:47.487 --> 01:49.420
<i>Come on, sugar.</i>

01:49.422 --> 01:52.189
Why don't you
take me with-- Aghh!

01:53.859 --> 01:55.226
<i>My name's Billy too!</i>

01:57.929 --> 02:00.731
So do we know each other?

02:00.733 --> 02:02.733
All right, I have him.
What's next?

02:02.735 --> 02:03.934
Who are you talking to?

02:03.936 --> 02:06.270
Who are you?
Hello?

02:06.272 --> 02:07.905
Hello!

02:07.907 --> 02:10.741
Wrong side.
I'm deaf in that ear.

02:10.743 --> 02:11.941
Can you do a German accent?

02:11.943 --> 02:13.577
- Um...
- Learn.

02:13.579 --> 02:15.746
Yes, thank you for noticing.

02:15.748 --> 02:17.113
Yes, thank you for noticing.

02:17.115 --> 02:19.182
Look, thanks for
busting me out and all,

02:19.184 --> 02:20.417
but what the hell is going on?

02:20.419 --> 02:21.951
In your case, Billy,

02:21.953 --> 02:23.820
I haven't figured that out yet.

02:23.822 --> 02:25.689
All I know is that
the fate of the future

02:25.691 --> 02:27.123
hangs in the balance,

02:27.125 --> 02:29.025
and you have some role to play.

02:29.027 --> 02:30.526
Shave.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:39.770 --> 02:41.304
Yeah, I don't mean to complain,

02:41.306 --> 02:43.806
but I'm probably
gonna die soon.

02:47.577 --> 02:50.946
The pants will be a bit long.

02:53.283 --> 02:55.117
So what do you need me
to boost?

02:55.119 --> 02:57.586
You do know
I'm a car thief, right?

02:57.588 --> 02:59.721
I don't know, don't care.

02:59.723 --> 03:03.391
My boss only gives me the
information I need to do my job,

03:03.393 --> 03:06.494
and...

03:06.496 --> 03:09.898
right now I need you to learn
this signature, fast.

03:13.036 --> 03:15.304
Uh, I'm gonna need a--

03:15.306 --> 03:16.671
Hai chiizu.

03:17.773 --> 03:20.173
_

03:20.542 --> 03:22.677
That's Daizo.

03:22.679 --> 03:25.713
<i>I saved him from</i>
<i>the Tokyo Police last month.</i>

03:25.715 --> 03:27.348
He's been with me ever since.

03:27.350 --> 03:30.351
We good?

03:35.790 --> 03:39.226
Where were you
when I got busted?

03:39.228 --> 03:42.396
Ridgestone
Psychiatric Facility.

03:44.633 --> 03:46.600
Here we are.

03:46.602 --> 03:49.169
- Where?
- No idea.

03:50.972 --> 03:52.438
<i>Domo.</i>

03:52.903 --> 03:54.137
_

03:55.430 --> 03:57.894
_

04:00.081 --> 04:04.751
Oh, I love it when you do this.

04:04.753 --> 04:07.753
Not you.
Go inside now.

04:13.134 --> 04:14.720
_

04:17.898 --> 04:19.565
Dr. Schmitz?

04:19.567 --> 04:22.501
Dr. Schmitz,
got a package for you.

04:22.503 --> 04:24.203
ID and signature, please.

04:41.500 --> 04:42.995
_

04:43.297 --> 04:44.586
_

04:45.858 --> 04:47.693
Did you change your hair?

04:47.695 --> 04:50.662
Yes, thank you for noticing.

04:59.839 --> 05:01.873
We should go
before he gets here.

05:01.875 --> 05:04.375
Who?

05:09.148 --> 05:14.574
_

05:14.575 --> 05:16.142
_

05:18.324 --> 05:20.024
So what was all this?

05:20.026 --> 05:21.692
My boss and I are trying

05:21.694 --> 05:24.695
to stop something very bad
from happening.

05:24.697 --> 05:26.331
So what do you think?

05:26.332 --> 05:28.000
_

05:28.332 --> 05:31.468
3109 West 23rd Street.

05:31.470 --> 05:33.804
Looks like that's
where I'm headed next.

05:33.806 --> 05:35.672
Why?

05:35.674 --> 05:38.142
You'll find out
when you get there.

05:38.144 --> 05:39.676
Thanks for playing.

05:39.678 --> 05:42.579
Now here's your
lovely parting gift.

05:42.581 --> 05:45.081
At the second lunch table
on the left in cell block D,

05:45.083 --> 05:48.351
sit across from a 300-pound
Chickasaw named Arnold.

05:48.353 --> 05:50.620
He loves dinosaurs
as much as you do.

05:50.622 --> 05:54.758
Tell him that, and he'll
have your back forever.

05:59.030 --> 06:00.263
<i>There he is!</i>

06:00.265 --> 06:01.630
<i>- Police! Police!</i>
<i>- Don't move!</i>

06:01.632 --> 06:02.765
<i>Stay right where you are.</i>

06:02.767 --> 06:05.367
Put your hands in the air.

06:17.114 --> 06:21.983
So whom am I looking for
this time?

06:21.985 --> 06:24.720
Powerful CEO?

06:24.722 --> 06:27.556
A rogue hacker?

06:27.558 --> 06:28.890
A hit man posing

06:28.892 --> 06:32.828
as a delivery guy?

06:35.231 --> 06:37.699
Hmm, fascinating.

06:42.638 --> 06:45.440
Hello, Cyrus.

06:45.442 --> 06:48.243
I'm supposed to take you
to breakfast.

06:50.779 --> 06:54.081
Just a PB&J, huh?

06:54.083 --> 06:57.251
You sure you wouldn't
rather have some eggs?

06:57.253 --> 06:59.920
No, thanks.
This is dinner for me.

06:59.922 --> 07:02.022
Working nights
is all about routine.

07:02.024 --> 07:03.825
Gotta trick your body
into going to sleep

07:03.827 --> 07:05.993
when the rest of the world
is waking up.

07:05.995 --> 07:09.997
Same meal, same place
every day,

07:09.999 --> 07:12.432
or I don't sleep a wink.

07:14.336 --> 07:15.936
But I do appreciate the meal

07:15.938 --> 07:17.872
and the hot cocoa.

07:22.110 --> 07:25.679
Normally people ask
more questions.

07:25.681 --> 07:28.548
- Such as?
- "Who are you?"

07:28.550 --> 07:30.350
"What do you want with me?"

07:30.352 --> 07:32.452
"What the hell's
going on?"

07:32.454 --> 07:35.221
Que será, será.

07:35.223 --> 07:36.857
Whatever will be, will be.

07:36.859 --> 07:38.859
Took me a long time to see it,

07:38.861 --> 07:41.527
but there's an order
to things, a plan.

07:41.529 --> 07:44.197
And everything that happens
is part of it,

07:44.199 --> 07:46.399
including you.

07:46.401 --> 07:48.834
But if it makes you
feel any better,

07:48.836 --> 07:50.703
what the hell is going on?

07:50.705 --> 07:54.007
My boss wanted me
to talk to you.

07:54.009 --> 07:55.875
Which means you and I
are supposed

07:55.877 --> 07:57.976
to do something together,

07:57.978 --> 07:59.578
something important.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.947
Sounds like you got
a weird job.

08:01.949 --> 08:04.650
What's your boss want us to do?

08:04.652 --> 08:06.752
She won't say.

08:06.754 --> 08:10.255
She likes it better when
I figure it out myself.

08:10.257 --> 08:12.725
Sounds like you have
a weird boss.

08:17.630 --> 08:22.301
Well, now I go to the park
for a walk, rain or shine.

08:22.303 --> 08:24.669
Fresh air helps me
have good dreams.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.172
You're more than welcome
to join if you like.

08:44.457 --> 08:46.023
You should know better

08:46.025 --> 08:49.026
than to try to sneak up
on me, Harold.

08:52.030 --> 08:55.066
Did you come to welcome me
back to New York?

08:55.068 --> 08:57.034
Actually, we're here
for Mr. Wells.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.536
His number came

08:59.538 --> 09:01.605
at 7:04 this morning.

09:01.607 --> 09:03.540
Your multifaceted machine

09:03.542 --> 09:06.543
sure does work in mysterious
ways, doesn't she?

09:06.545 --> 09:08.946
In this case perhaps
not that mysterious.

09:08.948 --> 09:11.648
When Mr. Reese and Ms. Shaw
accessed the security system

09:11.650 --> 09:13.884
in the building where he works,

09:13.886 --> 09:17.187
they found you approaching him

09:17.189 --> 09:21.791
at precisely 7:04 AM.

09:21.793 --> 09:25.728
I've prepared a preliminary
study of his digital footprint,

09:25.730 --> 09:28.231
and in my estimation
the most dangerous thing

09:28.233 --> 09:30.700
in Cyrus Wells's life is you.

09:30.702 --> 09:35.171
Whatever your plan is,
Ms. Groves,

09:35.173 --> 09:37.907
I believe you're gonna
get him killed.

09:39.220 --> 09:42.089
<font color="336699">Sync and corrections by n17t01</font>
<font color="336699">www.addic7ed.com</font>

09:49.718 --> 09:51.218
Relax, Harold.

09:51.220 --> 09:52.754
Nobody's getting
anybody killed.

09:52.756 --> 09:56.323
Cyrus is perfectly safe
with me.

09:56.325 --> 09:58.325
If the machine sent us
his number,

09:58.327 --> 10:02.830
it may mean that you are
placing Mr. Wells at risk.

10:02.832 --> 10:06.267
Or it could mean
I'm here to protect him.

10:06.269 --> 10:08.502
Honestly, Harold,
keeping up with everything

10:08.504 --> 10:11.238
the machine whispers
in my ear can be tricky,

10:11.240 --> 10:13.573
especially now
that I'm down to one.

10:13.575 --> 10:15.175
Oh, my.

10:15.177 --> 10:17.411
Oh, did you not hear
about my chat with Control?

10:17.413 --> 10:19.513
She's fun...

10:19.515 --> 10:23.116
in an unnecessary
stapedectomy kind of way.

10:23.118 --> 10:25.419
But I do miss music in stereo.

10:25.421 --> 10:28.722
I'm sorry.

10:28.724 --> 10:30.524
The machine offered me a job.

10:30.526 --> 10:32.559
She never said
it would be easy.

10:32.561 --> 10:35.896
And what job is that exactly?

10:35.898 --> 10:39.799
Trying to save the world,
of course.

10:39.801 --> 10:43.269
By preventing the emergence
of a second machine.

10:43.271 --> 10:45.038
Samaritan.

10:45.040 --> 10:46.505
Genetically programmed,

10:46.507 --> 10:49.042
fully targetable,
and nearly complete.

10:49.044 --> 10:53.579
Samaritan presents a serious
threat to our machine, Harold.

10:53.581 --> 10:56.415
And Decima's trying
to bring it to life.

10:57.751 --> 10:59.819
Do you really want
to see what it looks like

10:59.821 --> 11:03.722
when two gods go to war?

11:03.724 --> 11:05.791
Maybe you should
be more worried

11:05.793 --> 11:08.160
about what happens
when Samaritan comes online

11:08.162 --> 11:11.496
than about what happens
to some janitor.

11:11.498 --> 11:15.167
How much do you know about
this janitor, Ms. Groves?

11:15.169 --> 11:17.635
Well...

11:17.637 --> 11:19.571
he's got some interesting ideas

11:19.573 --> 11:21.473
about metaphysical determinism,

11:21.475 --> 11:24.742
and I think
he's a Doris Day fan.

11:24.744 --> 11:28.412
Do you know that he has
an MBA in finance from Fordham?

11:28.414 --> 11:29.981
<i>Do you know he was</i>
<i>a multimillionaire</i>

11:29.983 --> 11:31.783
<i>by the age of 35?</i>

11:31.785 --> 11:32.917
Do you know he hasn't worked

11:32.919 --> 11:35.487
<i>on Wall Street since 2009?</i>

11:35.489 --> 11:37.088
Would you even care
to know why?

11:37.090 --> 11:38.690
Perhaps you should
ask the machine

11:38.692 --> 11:41.192
for a bit more information
about Cyrus Wells

11:41.194 --> 11:44.128
before you deem him
insignificant.

11:44.130 --> 11:47.865
He'll be fine, I promise.

11:47.867 --> 11:50.234
<i>I know it seems weird,</i>

11:50.236 --> 11:52.736
but I'm one
of the good guys now, Harold.

11:59.211 --> 12:01.545
<i>Third from the bottom,</i>

12:01.547 --> 12:04.715
15th on the right, behind you.

12:13.791 --> 12:15.558
Root wouldn't take "Go"
for an answer?

12:15.560 --> 12:17.327
No, I'm afraid not.

12:17.329 --> 12:19.496
Seems that she thinks
she has the situation

12:19.498 --> 12:21.464
well in hand.

12:21.466 --> 12:24.234
Ms. Groves has never
been particularly concerned

12:24.236 --> 12:26.236
about collateral damage,

12:26.238 --> 12:29.572
which may be precisely what
Cyrus Wells is about to become.

12:29.574 --> 12:31.908
Watch over them
until we can figure out

12:31.910 --> 12:33.342
what's going on.

12:33.344 --> 12:35.177
In the meantime,
I'll try to determine

12:35.179 --> 12:38.581
what message
this is meant to convey.

12:38.590 --> 12:40.000
_

12:40.083 --> 12:41.584
Seems pretty clear
to me, Finch.

12:41.586 --> 12:44.020
I think she likes you, Harold.

12:49.793 --> 12:53.662
<i>So I don't want</i>
<i>to be rude or anything,</i>

12:53.664 --> 12:56.265
but, yeah,

12:56.267 --> 12:58.333
look, thank you
for the hot cocoa,

12:58.335 --> 13:01.836
and it was nice of you
to walk me home.

13:01.838 --> 13:04.005
But whatever it is you're
doing right now is not--

13:04.007 --> 13:07.508
Necessary.
Trust me.

13:19.221 --> 13:21.556
<i>I heard you skipped breakfast.</i>

13:21.558 --> 13:25.093
And you and your
Australopithecine coworker

13:25.095 --> 13:28.362
can just take the day off.

13:28.364 --> 13:31.132
I've been doing just fine
without a safety net.

13:31.134 --> 13:32.467
Look, the only reason
you're not stuck

13:32.469 --> 13:33.968
in a cage right now is me.

13:33.970 --> 13:35.803
Don't make me look bad.

13:35.805 --> 13:40.207
I couldn't make you
look bad if I tried.

13:50.585 --> 13:52.319
<i>You should start packing</i>
<i>your toiletries.</i>

13:52.321 --> 13:53.520
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

13:53.522 --> 13:56.556
No, no, no, okay?

13:56.558 --> 13:58.558
Seriously, no.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.527
I have to work again tonight.

14:00.529 --> 14:03.130
I need to sleep,
so it's time for you to leave.

14:03.132 --> 14:06.266
Actually, it's time
for us both to leave.

14:06.268 --> 14:08.635
Things are about
to get interesting.

14:08.637 --> 14:10.137
What?

14:10.139 --> 14:11.504
Why?

14:15.009 --> 14:17.510
Is this about what happened

14:17.512 --> 14:18.945
at my old job?

14:22.783 --> 14:24.350
What did happen?

14:24.352 --> 14:27.319
None of your business.
Give me that.

14:27.321 --> 14:28.954
Who are these people, Cyrus?

14:28.956 --> 14:32.024
Their names.
It could be important.

14:32.026 --> 14:33.692
It's not.
You have to go.

14:33.694 --> 14:35.594
Did they get hurt?
Did you get hurt?

14:35.596 --> 14:36.795
I-I need to know
what happened.

14:41.834 --> 14:43.602
<i>Finch, I've got
eyes on a sniper.</i>

14:43.604 --> 14:46.371
And I might have a lead
on who's doing the shooting.

14:46.373 --> 14:48.273
<i>The solicitation
Ms. Groves gave me</i>

14:48.275 --> 14:49.775
<i>is visually identical</i>
<i>to an image</i>

14:49.777 --> 14:51.276
commonly sent out as spam.

14:51.278 --> 14:52.811
But digitally

14:52.813 --> 14:55.547
someone has hidden a message
inside the image.

14:55.549 --> 14:58.950
<i>It's encrypted with</i>
<i>a running key cipher.</i>

14:58.952 --> 15:01.519
But I can't decode it
without--

15:01.521 --> 15:02.987
"Behind you,
third from the bottom,

15:02.989 --> 15:04.222
15th from the right."

15:11.297 --> 15:12.730
De Tocqueville.

15:15.568 --> 15:17.568
I believe I know
who we're dealing with.

15:19.637 --> 15:22.840
Vigilance.

15:29.581 --> 15:30.748
We'll take her.

15:30.750 --> 15:34.351
You four get the target.

15:34.353 --> 15:36.520
It's happening again.

15:36.522 --> 15:38.322
Do you think you
could do that later?

15:38.324 --> 15:39.756
'Cause we should probably go.

15:39.758 --> 15:42.259
No, no, no.
Please.

15:42.261 --> 15:44.628
Guns make me
very, very nervous.

15:46.164 --> 15:47.664
Well...

15:47.666 --> 15:50.133
we've got a sniper outside

15:50.135 --> 15:52.535
and four heavily-armed
privacy terrorists

15:52.537 --> 15:54.337
coming up the north stairwell.

15:54.339 --> 15:57.841
So a gun would be nice, but...

15:59.509 --> 16:02.045
You think of everything.

16:05.750 --> 16:08.117
Tear gas.
Hold your breath.

16:10.920 --> 16:12.722
Wait.
What about the sniper?

16:12.724 --> 16:14.624
Trust me.

16:20.365 --> 16:21.797
Wanna see who's got better aim?

16:23.399 --> 16:24.800
Aah!

16:28.605 --> 16:30.405
Got eyes on the target.

16:38.915 --> 16:41.983
<i>I'm afraid Vigilance may
not be our only threat, Mr. Reese.</i>

16:41.985 --> 16:43.752
I decrypted their spam message,

16:43.754 --> 16:45.887
and it seems that Vigilance
is only targeting

16:45.889 --> 16:48.089
Mr. Wells because
his name came up

16:48.091 --> 16:50.091
in a secret communique
they intercepted

16:50.093 --> 16:51.859
from Decima.

16:58.233 --> 17:01.335
I don't think Root's
our biggest problem anymore.

17:05.240 --> 17:06.840
Hey, who are those guys?

17:06.843 --> 17:09.343
I told you things were gonna
get interesting.

17:22.270 --> 17:24.369
The target's in sight, sir.
We're moving in.

17:24.372 --> 17:26.204
Shouldn't we run?

17:26.207 --> 17:28.608
Shh.
I can't hear my boss.

17:28.610 --> 17:30.844
Hi, here's $20.

17:36.350 --> 17:37.851
Whoa, why are we stopping?

17:37.853 --> 17:40.020
Because there are more
where those four came from.

17:40.022 --> 17:42.288
And this is the quickest way
to get you out of here

17:42.290 --> 17:43.889
without shooting someone.

17:43.891 --> 17:45.124
Keep your shoulders relaxed

17:45.126 --> 17:46.926
when they put the handcuffs on.

17:50.931 --> 17:52.331
You!

17:52.333 --> 17:54.967
<i>Hands in the air.</i>

17:54.969 --> 17:56.569
What?

17:56.571 --> 17:58.270
Hands in the air.

17:58.272 --> 17:59.905
Ow.

18:04.844 --> 18:07.412
Cyrus is safe, Finch.

18:07.414 --> 18:10.082
But we'll need Fusco's help
to keep it that way.

18:10.084 --> 18:11.584
And Ms. Groves?

18:11.586 --> 18:13.018
Gone.

18:13.020 --> 18:14.819
So are the boys from Decima.

18:14.821 --> 18:17.489
Do we have any idea
what Cyrus did

18:17.491 --> 18:19.558
<i>to piss off both them</i>
<i>and Vigilance?</i>

18:19.560 --> 18:21.593
As far as I can tell, nothing.

18:21.595 --> 18:23.495
But whatever's going on,
I'm starting to suspect

18:23.497 --> 18:26.731
that it has more to do with
his new job than his old one.

18:26.733 --> 18:29.101
I hacked the computer system

18:29.103 --> 18:31.335
at the janitorial service
that employs Cyrus

18:31.337 --> 18:34.606
and discovered they recently
ran a background check on him.

18:34.608 --> 18:36.207
<i>Why?</i>

18:36.209 --> 18:38.776
What kind of janitor
needs a background check?

18:38.778 --> 18:40.244
Something to look into

18:40.246 --> 18:41.946
when we reconnect
with Ms. Shaw.

18:41.948 --> 18:43.681
<i>I lost her signal</i>
<i>when the shooting started.</i>

18:43.683 --> 18:46.783
She said she saw a sniper.

18:46.785 --> 18:48.785
<i>But I don't see</i>
<i>any sign of her here.</i>

18:48.787 --> 18:50.488
Between Shaw and Cyrus,

18:50.490 --> 18:53.124
I think I know who needs
our help more.

18:53.126 --> 18:54.725
Then I'm afraid
we'll have to trust Ms. Shaw

18:54.727 --> 18:57.694
to take care of herself.

18:57.696 --> 19:01.465
_

19:01.467 --> 19:04.034
Now that you're not gonna die,
we can have a little chat.

19:04.036 --> 19:06.103
So you need a hospital,

19:06.105 --> 19:08.639
and I need to know why
everyone's after the janitor.

19:14.578 --> 19:17.080
<i>You owe me a sniper.</i>

19:19.117 --> 19:21.384
This is Collier, right?

19:21.386 --> 19:22.818
Or at least that's your alias?

19:22.820 --> 19:24.487
<i>Can't say I know yours.</i>

19:24.489 --> 19:26.656
So I'll just call you
a target of opportunity.

19:26.658 --> 19:28.791
Vigilance came here
to interrogate Cyrus Wells,

19:28.793 --> 19:30.726
but now we're here for you.

19:30.728 --> 19:32.995
<i>See, based on</i>
<i>the way you fight,</i>

19:32.997 --> 19:34.797
<i>I think you were</i>
<i>a clandestine operative</i>

19:34.799 --> 19:37.066
for the good old US of A.

19:37.068 --> 19:39.969
But based on
the people you protect,

19:39.971 --> 19:43.005
I think you're not anymore.

19:43.007 --> 19:45.574
And I'm guessing it's
because they betrayed you.

19:45.576 --> 19:46.776
<i>Are you guys gonna shoot again</i>

19:46.778 --> 19:48.844
or just talk me to death?

19:51.682 --> 19:52.981
Well, actually
I'm more interested

19:52.983 --> 19:54.483
in what you have to say.

19:54.485 --> 19:55.617
So I've taken the liberty

19:55.619 --> 19:56.851
of sealing off the exits.

19:56.853 --> 19:59.321
Now in exchange
for everything you know

19:59.323 --> 20:00.855
about the Samaritan system

20:00.857 --> 20:02.524
and the people
that are trying to build it,

20:02.526 --> 20:04.025
I'm prepared
to offer you something

20:04.027 --> 20:07.696
that no one else can--

20:07.698 --> 20:10.799
Revenge on the government
<i>that betrayed you.</i>

20:10.801 --> 20:12.466
And if I refuse?

20:12.468 --> 20:15.503
In the words
of Benjamin Franklin,

20:15.505 --> 20:17.605
join or die.

20:21.677 --> 20:23.577
Have you secured
Mr. Wells, Detective?

20:23.579 --> 20:25.079
Yeah, I got him.

20:25.081 --> 20:26.614
And I'm clearing up
the charges too.

20:26.616 --> 20:27.982
You're welcome very much.

20:27.984 --> 20:29.282
A phrase which now
makes my thanks

20:29.284 --> 20:31.251
seem less than sincere,
Detective.

20:31.253 --> 20:33.120
I'm sending you GPS coordinates

20:33.122 --> 20:35.122
for a rendezvous
with Mr. Reese,

20:35.124 --> 20:37.625
who will henceforth
protect Mr. Wells.

20:37.627 --> 20:40.260
All right.

20:40.262 --> 20:43.263
Okay, pal, let's
get you out of here.

20:45.066 --> 20:46.699
Come on, this way.

20:46.701 --> 20:49.769
You forgot to transfer
from savings again, Lionel.

20:49.771 --> 20:51.738
Your rent check's gonna bounce.

20:51.740 --> 20:54.241
- Hi, Cyrus.
- Hey.

20:54.243 --> 20:55.942
Hey, nice try, Cocoa Puffs.

20:55.944 --> 20:57.411
There's no way I'm letting him
leave here with you.

20:57.413 --> 20:59.478
I understand.

20:59.480 --> 21:01.681
But there are things
you don't know.

21:01.683 --> 21:04.450
For starters,
you don't know that Cyrus

21:04.452 --> 21:07.020
is currently wanted
by not one, but two

21:07.022 --> 21:09.022
very dangerous organizations.

21:09.024 --> 21:10.790
And you have no idea
that there are currently

21:10.792 --> 21:12.792
27 people en route
to this location,

21:12.794 --> 21:14.460
the closest of whom is carrying

21:14.462 --> 21:16.895
two concealed firearms
and a push dagger

21:16.897 --> 21:19.965
he used to kill three people
in Dubai last month--

21:19.967 --> 21:21.700
one of them just for fun.

21:21.702 --> 21:24.002
I don't care how big
your brain is.

21:24.004 --> 21:25.504
Nobody's taking this guy
from me

21:25.506 --> 21:30.076
without a big fat
federal warrant, you got that?

21:30.078 --> 21:32.811
Joined the Bureau last month
to get access

21:32.813 --> 21:36.214
to a nuclear plant in Tulsa.

21:36.216 --> 21:38.483
Long story.

21:38.485 --> 21:41.252
Is there a problem here, Fusco?

21:41.254 --> 21:43.989
Um, no Captain.

21:43.991 --> 21:46.925
There's no problem.

21:49.128 --> 21:50.995
Is there a back way
out of here?

21:50.997 --> 21:52.197
Yeah, it's, uh--

21:52.199 --> 21:54.199
I wasn't asking you.

21:58.137 --> 21:59.704
You let her what?

21:59.706 --> 22:01.739
She had a
warrant-- a real one.

22:01.741 --> 22:03.074
What was I supposed to say?

22:03.076 --> 22:04.942
"Sorry, boss, Agent King
is actually

22:04.944 --> 22:06.243
a superpowered nutball.

22:06.245 --> 22:08.212
Just ask my buddy,
the urban legend."

22:24.895 --> 22:26.463
<i>Relax, John.</i>

22:26.465 --> 22:28.432
<i>Have a little faith.</i>

22:28.434 --> 22:30.734
You're making a mistake.

22:30.736 --> 22:32.969
Cyrus is safer with me.

22:32.971 --> 22:35.972
You don't really
believe that, do you?

22:35.974 --> 22:37.707
Have you and Harold
even figured out

22:37.709 --> 22:39.808
why Decima is after him yet?

22:39.810 --> 22:41.110
That power you have?

22:41.112 --> 22:42.477
I've had it too.

22:42.479 --> 22:43.779
I know just
what it's like to have

22:43.781 --> 22:45.413
all those answers
buzzing in your ear.

22:45.415 --> 22:47.816
But at the end of the day,
you still make choices.

22:47.818 --> 22:49.084
<i>And if the choice</i>
<i>you're making now</i>

22:49.086 --> 22:51.820
<i>- gets Cyrus killed--</i>
<i>- Whatever happens,</i>

22:51.822 --> 22:54.256
I'll be there to save him,

22:54.258 --> 22:58.026
just like I was there
to save you.

22:58.028 --> 23:00.162
After everything we've
been through together, John,

23:00.164 --> 23:02.430
you really should trust me.

23:10.773 --> 23:12.774
Are you sure it's safe here?

23:12.776 --> 23:15.677
I can protect you anywhere.

23:15.679 --> 23:21.115
I thought this place
might help you relax.

23:21.117 --> 23:23.084
Sorry I've kept you up
past your bedtime.

23:23.086 --> 23:24.652
Yeah, that's all right.

23:24.654 --> 23:27.855
To tell the truth, I don't
sleep very well anyway.

23:27.857 --> 23:32.793
Yeah, about that--

23:32.795 --> 23:36.163
I'd still like to know
what happened.

23:36.165 --> 23:37.665
Your boss seems
to know everything.

23:37.667 --> 23:39.266
Why don't you ask her?

23:39.268 --> 23:41.635
I did.

23:41.637 --> 23:44.572
She won't tell me.

23:46.607 --> 23:50.077
Please, Cyrus,
who are these people?

23:56.650 --> 23:58.819
Sarah Lind and Alex Rice--

23:58.821 --> 24:01.354
my best friends from college.

24:01.356 --> 24:03.889
After graduation,
they started a small

24:03.891 --> 24:06.892
financial services firm
and brought me on

24:06.894 --> 24:09.829
to help 'em run it.

24:09.831 --> 24:12.198
When everybody was betting big
on the housing market,

24:12.200 --> 24:14.834
we played it safe.

24:14.836 --> 24:17.237
So when the crash came,

24:17.239 --> 24:20.472
we went from a small start-up
to a major player.

24:20.474 --> 24:22.842
But somebody was jealous.

24:22.844 --> 24:25.211
'Cause one day a guy walked
into our office

24:25.213 --> 24:28.180
and started shooting.

24:28.182 --> 24:31.416
Alex and Sarah were killed.

24:31.418 --> 24:34.353
Five others were shot,
including me.

24:34.355 --> 24:36.688
The gunman was
never identified.

24:36.690 --> 24:40.058
And when was this, exactly?

24:40.060 --> 24:42.827
April 4, 2009.

24:49.302 --> 24:51.436
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

24:51.438 --> 24:54.438
Ten weeks in ICU makes you

24:54.440 --> 24:56.374
take a long, hard look
at things.

24:56.376 --> 24:58.877
I realized I had wasted
the first 30 years of my life

24:58.879 --> 25:02.046
putting zeros
on my bank account.

25:02.048 --> 25:06.017
So I gave all my money away
to charity.

25:06.019 --> 25:07.451
Now I get up every night

25:07.453 --> 25:10.554
and keep that building
spic and span.

25:10.556 --> 25:14.925
'Cause who doesn't like
clean floors?

25:14.927 --> 25:17.261
Que será, será.

25:17.263 --> 25:19.363
What happened that day
was part of a plan.

25:19.365 --> 25:21.899
No. No, what--

25:21.901 --> 25:23.634
whatever this was, believe me,

25:23.636 --> 25:28.471
it was not part of
some grand cosmic plan.

25:29.975 --> 25:31.074
We need to go.

25:31.076 --> 25:34.211
They're almost here.

25:34.213 --> 25:36.613
<i>We're at the
coordinates you sent, sir.</i>

25:36.615 --> 25:38.548
But we can't get a visual
<i>on the targets.</i>

25:38.550 --> 25:39.917
You will.

25:39.919 --> 25:41.984
Deploy the countermeasure.

25:46.524 --> 25:50.427
_

25:52.229 --> 25:55.231
Can you hear me?

25:56.412 --> 25:57.807
_

26:01.939 --> 26:04.974
- What do we do now?
- Run.

26:10.081 --> 26:12.315
- Get in the car!
- Cyrus!

26:21.459 --> 26:24.526
I guess you better answer that.

26:46.950 --> 26:49.486
Drop the weapon!

26:49.488 --> 26:52.155
Drop it now!

26:52.157 --> 26:53.623
I don't like killing patriots,

26:53.625 --> 26:55.758
so I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

26:55.760 --> 26:57.960
That's funny, I was gonna
say the same thing to you.

26:57.962 --> 27:00.830
See, I knew we had
something in common--

27:00.832 --> 27:04.066
many things, I suspect.

27:04.068 --> 27:06.735
You're not the only one
the government has betrayed.

27:06.737 --> 27:09.571
And that's why
I want your help.

27:09.573 --> 27:11.573
See, America's dying.

27:11.575 --> 27:13.475
And everybody knows it.

27:13.477 --> 27:16.478
It's not just about privacy,
it's about principle.

27:16.480 --> 27:21.016
Our nation is assassinating
people with drones,

27:21.018 --> 27:23.018
holding them
without due process,

27:23.020 --> 27:25.721
and, yes, spying
on its own people

27:25.723 --> 27:28.156
without cause or limits
and in direct violation

27:28.158 --> 27:29.825
of our constitution.

27:29.827 --> 27:32.861
But we have a plan to stop it.

27:32.863 --> 27:36.064
And if you join us,

27:36.066 --> 27:38.666
you will not only
have your revenge,

27:38.668 --> 27:40.568
but you will help
write a new chapter

27:40.570 --> 27:43.038
in American history.

27:45.006 --> 27:47.241
You're right about all of it.

27:47.243 --> 27:49.344
<i>I did work for the government,</i>

27:49.346 --> 27:52.112
and I do want revenge.

27:52.114 --> 27:54.682
<i>But if that work</i>
<i>taught me anything,</i>

27:54.684 --> 27:57.819
it's that how you do
matters as much

27:57.821 --> 27:59.487
as what you do.

27:59.489 --> 28:03.690
And by that metric,
you're all just terrorists.

28:03.692 --> 28:05.892
And I kill terrorists.

28:12.501 --> 28:13.667
I lost Decima's trail

28:13.669 --> 28:15.235
about a mile from the park.

28:15.237 --> 28:17.370
Do we have any other way
to find Cyrus?

28:17.372 --> 28:18.938
Not at the moment.

28:18.940 --> 28:21.274
But I may have discovered
why Decima wants him.

28:21.276 --> 28:23.609
<i>I've located the
original communique</i>

28:23.611 --> 28:25.278
that Vigilance intercepted
<i>from Decima.</i>

28:25.280 --> 28:27.113
The message that
started all of this.

28:27.115 --> 28:29.415
It lists Cyrus
as 1 of 15 people

28:29.417 --> 28:31.351
with retinal access.

28:31.353 --> 28:33.086
<i>As in retinal scanner?</i>

28:33.088 --> 28:35.287
So somewhere out there
is a door,

28:35.289 --> 28:37.790
and Cyrus Wells' eye
is the key.

28:37.792 --> 28:40.593
I believe I might know
where that door is.

28:40.595 --> 28:42.795
After passing
his background check at work,

28:42.797 --> 28:44.563
Cyrus became the only custodian

28:44.565 --> 28:46.565
allowed on the 19th floor.

28:46.567 --> 28:47.966
What's on the 19th floor?

28:47.968 --> 28:50.568
A company called
Maxwell Limited.

28:50.570 --> 28:52.537
All I know about them
so far is that

28:52.539 --> 28:55.140
they take regular deliveries
of liquid helium.

28:55.142 --> 28:57.409
I'm guessing they're not
blowing up balloons.

28:57.411 --> 28:58.710
Maxwell could be
using it to cool

28:58.712 --> 29:02.080
anything from
biomedical reactors to--

29:02.082 --> 29:06.385
The fastest computer
ever built.

29:06.387 --> 29:10.154
Maxwell's the corporate cover
for an NSA lab.

29:10.156 --> 29:12.289
And two days ago,
somebody working

29:12.291 --> 29:15.459
in that lab sent this.

29:16.067 --> 29:17.457
_

29:18.162 --> 29:19.797
Oh, my.

29:19.799 --> 29:21.565
Okay, Finch,
what am I missing here?

29:21.567 --> 29:23.667
It's a note from one
computer scientist to another,

29:23.669 --> 29:26.770
detailing the specifications
of a superconducting processor,

29:26.772 --> 29:29.472
three times faster
than anything now available.

29:29.474 --> 29:32.809
And since the government's
not about to sell it to them,

29:32.811 --> 29:36.512
Decima plans to use Cyrus
to steal it.

29:36.514 --> 29:38.982
The original Samaritan crashed
because a chip

29:38.984 --> 29:43.153
fast enough to run it
hadn't been built yet.

29:43.155 --> 29:45.821
Two days ago,
somebody built it.

29:45.823 --> 29:47.923
<i>Decima has the software.</i>

29:47.925 --> 29:51.660
Now they want the hardware.

29:51.662 --> 29:53.362
Right now, I'm more worried
about Cyrus.

29:53.364 --> 29:54.663
As soon as he opens that door,

29:54.665 --> 29:57.499
Decima's gonna kill him.

29:57.501 --> 30:01.136
I suppose you'll be
joining Mr. Reese.

30:01.138 --> 30:02.504
Not just yet.

30:02.506 --> 30:05.674
Decima's severed my link
to the machine.

30:05.676 --> 30:09.845
Temporarily, but
she didn't like that.

30:09.847 --> 30:12.514
So...

30:12.516 --> 30:15.951
she wants you to patch these
into this.

30:22.324 --> 30:23.858
The last time
you didn't help us

30:23.860 --> 30:26.194
when you should have,
people died.

30:36.872 --> 30:42.209
And once this device
is installed,

30:42.211 --> 30:45.145
which will you save?

30:45.147 --> 30:49.316
The chip or Cyrus Wells?

30:49.318 --> 30:52.252
<i>Since it was you</i>
<i>who put him in danger.</i>

30:52.254 --> 30:55.622
Fine, Harold.

30:55.624 --> 30:57.457
It's all my fault--

30:57.459 --> 30:59.692
mine and the machine's.
Happy?

30:59.694 --> 31:02.195
Far from it, but I do believe

31:02.197 --> 31:07.034
that there's a lesson here
about hubris.

31:07.036 --> 31:11.905
Well, if anyone
would know about hubris,

31:11.907 --> 31:14.440
it would be the man
who built God.

31:16.710 --> 31:20.413
She's worried about you,
Harold.

31:20.415 --> 31:21.881
We both are.

31:21.883 --> 31:24.517
The past three months,
you've slept an average

31:24.519 --> 31:26.752
of four hours per night.

31:26.754 --> 31:29.455
My problems are no concern
of yours, Ms. Groves.

31:29.457 --> 31:31.357
Perhaps if you had
1/10 as much interest

31:31.359 --> 31:34.093
in Cyrus's welfare,
he might not be about--

31:34.095 --> 31:37.063
By your own definition,

31:37.065 --> 31:39.932
Cyrus is irrelevant.

31:39.934 --> 31:42.935
Everyone is relevant
to someone.

31:44.904 --> 31:48.807
That man has spent every day
of his life

31:48.809 --> 31:50.976
believing that
there is actually

31:50.978 --> 31:53.178
some sort of higher plan.

31:53.180 --> 31:56.081
That's the problem
with humans--

31:56.083 --> 31:58.383
they just sit around,
hoping that

31:58.385 --> 31:59.817
someone will fix things.

31:59.819 --> 32:02.954
But no one will.
No one cares.

32:02.956 --> 32:05.490
The universe is infinite

32:05.492 --> 32:08.059
and chaotic and cold.

32:08.061 --> 32:12.630
And there has never
been a plan.

32:12.632 --> 32:16.233
At least not till now.

32:21.139 --> 32:22.139
You wanna know
what the plan was

32:22.141 --> 32:25.009
the day they died?

32:25.011 --> 32:29.013
The plan was for someone
to make $15 million.

32:29.015 --> 32:33.117
An executive at a big bank
wanted them dead,

32:33.119 --> 32:37.654
so he wired the money
to someone with the skills,

32:37.656 --> 32:42.426
resources, and moral depravity
to make that happen.

32:45.696 --> 32:48.698
And that someone was me.

32:53.537 --> 32:56.640
And the punch line

32:56.642 --> 33:00.644
is that your machine keeps
telling me to save Cyrus.

33:06.183 --> 33:08.117
How badly did you
have to break it

33:08.119 --> 33:11.120
to make it care
about people so much?

33:14.958 --> 33:17.993
That didn't break it.
It's what made it work.

33:17.995 --> 33:20.062
<i>It was only after</i>
<i>I taught the machine</i>

33:20.064 --> 33:22.064
that people mattered,
that it could begin

33:22.066 --> 33:24.867
to be able to help them.

33:31.207 --> 33:32.808
I'd like to do
the same thing for you,

33:32.810 --> 33:35.811
if you'd let me.

33:44.953 --> 33:47.789
In the first 30 minutes

33:47.791 --> 33:51.626
after Samaritan comes online,

33:51.628 --> 33:56.831
a lot of people are
gonna be killed.

33:56.833 --> 34:00.601
But they're gonna
start with four.

34:00.603 --> 34:03.504
You, me,

34:03.506 --> 34:07.374
your helper monkey, and Shaw.

34:07.376 --> 34:10.110
And there won't be
a damn thing anyone,

34:10.112 --> 34:14.681
including your machine,
can do to stop it.

34:14.684 --> 34:19.886
You think I don't care
about people, Harold?

34:19.888 --> 34:23.056
I'm doing all of this
to save you.

34:35.770 --> 34:37.370
Sorry, Doctor.

34:37.371 --> 34:39.239
I didn't have time
to make an appointment.

34:39.241 --> 34:42.975
But I know you'll
make an exception for me.

34:42.976 --> 34:44.210
Really?

34:44.212 --> 34:46.045
And, uh, how do you know that?

34:46.047 --> 34:47.980
The same way I know I can
put a bullet through your hand

34:47.982 --> 34:49.716
before you can dial 911.

34:49.717 --> 34:54.186
The same way I know you're
the best otolaryngologist

34:54.188 --> 34:56.088
in 250 miles.

34:56.090 --> 34:59.424
Okay, uh, what do you want?
Drugs?

34:59.426 --> 35:01.127
Not really.

35:01.129 --> 35:02.795
Although a little lidocaine
would be nice.

35:02.797 --> 35:04.596
I didn't get any the last time.

35:04.598 --> 35:08.167
You see, somebody broke my ear.

35:08.169 --> 35:11.937
And you're gonna fix it.

35:18.311 --> 35:20.178
Building security
has been neutralized.

35:20.180 --> 35:21.913
We're ready to take the chip.

35:21.915 --> 35:24.182
Then let's begin, shall we?

36:08.226 --> 36:09.693
Very good.

36:09.695 --> 36:11.995
You may dispose of him now.

36:15.466 --> 36:17.534
Wait. What are you--
No, let me go!

36:17.536 --> 36:21.305
Please. The minimum healing time
is three weeks before--

36:21.307 --> 36:24.073
Unfortunately, I'm on
a bit of a schedule.

36:24.075 --> 36:27.544
And I won't be needing that.

36:27.546 --> 36:30.580
Okay, I'm turning it on.

36:32.651 --> 36:34.651
_

36:34.652 --> 36:37.587
Now you're going
to hear a series of tones.

36:37.589 --> 36:39.488
I can hear you.

36:39.490 --> 36:42.491
I didn't start yet.

36:45.595 --> 36:47.596
I wasn't talking to you.

36:58.060 --> 36:59.695
We're in the lab.

36:59.696 --> 37:02.930
<i>Take all the research,
wipe the computers,</i>

37:02.932 --> 37:04.666
<i>and locate the chip.</i>

37:04.668 --> 37:06.300
<i>Haste makes waste.</i>

37:06.302 --> 37:08.469
The chamber is cooled
to within a few degrees

37:08.471 --> 37:10.772
of absolute zero.

37:10.774 --> 37:13.141
<i>Opening now would kill you all.</i>

37:13.143 --> 37:16.177
And more importantly
damage the chip.

37:16.179 --> 37:18.146
Listen closely
to the warm-up protocol

37:18.148 --> 37:21.315
and do exactly as I say.

37:21.317 --> 37:23.049
No, no, please, don't.

37:23.051 --> 37:26.019
Settle down.
It'll all be over soon.

37:26.021 --> 37:29.490
We got plenty of bleach.

37:29.492 --> 37:32.025
Oh, no, no, no.

37:32.027 --> 37:33.661
This is not the plan.

37:33.663 --> 37:35.195
This can't be the plan.

37:38.500 --> 37:39.866
Oh, God!

37:39.868 --> 37:41.401
What did you say to him?

37:45.673 --> 37:47.400
_

37:51.946 --> 37:53.513
<i>She is persistent.</i>

37:53.515 --> 37:55.014
Countermeasures.

38:10.163 --> 38:12.097
<i>233 Kelvin.</i>

38:12.099 --> 38:13.498
<i>The chamber is now safe.</i>

38:13.500 --> 38:17.102
<i>Get the chip and go.</i>

38:35.955 --> 38:37.856
Fusco.

38:37.858 --> 38:39.424
I'm gonna try to get to Cyrus.

38:39.426 --> 38:40.792
Be ready to cover me.

38:40.794 --> 38:42.961
He'll just run away again.

38:42.963 --> 38:44.695
He doesn't like guns.

38:47.900 --> 38:50.902
You think the machine's gonna
help you dodge bullets?

38:50.904 --> 38:52.370
No.

38:54.707 --> 38:58.243
It's okay.
I'm coming to you.

39:06.218 --> 39:07.818
Hey, Cyrus, wanna
get out of here?

39:30.608 --> 39:32.475
<i>The Maxwell chip
is in custody, sir.</i>

39:32.477 --> 39:34.010
We've cleared the perimeter.

39:34.012 --> 39:37.013
Then our work here is done.

39:38.282 --> 39:41.117
Do tidy up, please.

39:46.590 --> 39:48.157
Cyrus is safe, Finch,

39:48.159 --> 39:50.026
but Decima got away
with the chip.

39:50.028 --> 39:51.427
That may not be our only loss.

39:51.429 --> 39:54.196
I still haven't heard
from Miss--

39:56.699 --> 40:00.002
What happened to you guys?

40:00.004 --> 40:02.838
You missed all the fun.

40:14.884 --> 40:16.985
What are they saying?

40:16.987 --> 40:21.222
I know you can't
bluejack her anymore.

40:21.224 --> 40:24.159
But do you expect us to believe
you didn't bug that balcony?

40:24.161 --> 40:27.395
I suppose I thought
they deserved some privacy.

40:32.868 --> 40:35.236
Looks like it's time to go.

40:35.238 --> 40:38.306
I hope you don't mind
starting a new life.

40:38.308 --> 40:41.342
I was about due for one.

40:42.811 --> 40:45.746
Besides, it's all part
of the plan.

40:52.921 --> 40:54.455
Keep 'em dry.

40:54.457 --> 40:56.523
Change the dressings
every 72 hours.

40:56.525 --> 40:59.193
I love it when you play doctor.

41:08.536 --> 41:11.738
Was it just a coincidence--

41:11.740 --> 41:14.608
Cyrus and me?

41:14.610 --> 41:18.778
Or was the machine trying
to make some sort of point?

41:18.780 --> 41:22.916
You'd have to ask the machine.

41:22.918 --> 41:26.285
I did.

41:26.287 --> 41:28.555
She's not telling.

41:28.557 --> 41:31.424
Did you inform Mr. Wells

41:31.426 --> 41:34.394
about your role in his past?

41:34.396 --> 41:36.629
I wanted to.

41:36.631 --> 41:40.866
But that would've been for me.

41:40.868 --> 41:44.870
What Cyrus believes, it--

41:44.872 --> 41:49.041
it helps him.

41:49.043 --> 41:52.845
And who am I to say he's wrong?

41:55.682 --> 41:58.984
She wants me on a plane
to Paraguay in 20 minutes.

42:00.554 --> 42:03.120
About that--

42:03.122 --> 42:06.424
you're not wrong about
the threat Samaritan poses.

42:06.426 --> 42:11.563
And though you and I may not
see eye to eye on some things,

42:11.565 --> 42:16.167
perhaps we should collaborate
a bit more.

42:17.570 --> 42:19.170
Toward that end--

42:19.172 --> 42:21.672
Detective Fusco is here
to take me

42:21.674 --> 42:22.906
where I need to go.

42:27.779 --> 42:30.346
Hello, Lionel.

42:30.348 --> 42:33.349
Hey, Cuckoo's Nest,
the meter's running.

42:41.357 --> 42:44.293
Your smoke alarm's gonna
start beeping at 2:41 AM.

43:02.124 --> 43:07.668
