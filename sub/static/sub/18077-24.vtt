WEBVTT

00:03.960 --> 00:05.894
You sell out
while you still
have the chance.

00:05.962 --> 00:08.226
[Cathy screaming]
Whoa!

00:08.297 --> 00:10.231
''You have just found
the A-Team?''

00:10.600 --> 00:12.261
Maybe we'll find out why...

00:12.335 --> 00:15.600
a guy who makes beer
is so interested
in a health soda factory.

00:15.738 --> 00:17.433
They don't deliver,
they close down.

00:17.507 --> 00:18.496
[grunts]

00:20.276 --> 00:23.006
lt's the ad campaign,
Mr. Webb. lt's killing us.

00:23.079 --> 00:24.341
Well, who's running it
for them?

00:24.414 --> 00:25.438
(Drake)
Templeton Peck.

00:25.515 --> 00:28.109
Yes! Hi-Brite soda.

00:28.584 --> 00:31.815
[guns firing]

00:31.888 --> 00:33.150
You guys are crazy.

00:33.322 --> 00:35.449
Oh, he's an excellent judge
of character, huh, Colonel?

00:35.525 --> 00:36.514
Let's go fishing.

00:38.728 --> 00:39.888
l think we got a bite.

00:41.631 --> 00:42.655
Where's the meat?

00:42.732 --> 00:44.597
Why don't we
give him a taste
of what he wants?

00:47.970 --> 00:50.996
(male narrator)
In 1972,
a crack commando unit...

00:51.074 --> 00:52.735
was sent to prison
by a military court...

00:52.809 --> 00:54.276
for a crime
they didn't commit.

00:54.343 --> 00:55.674
These men promptly escaped...

00:55.745 --> 00:57.440
from a maximum-security
stockade...

00:57.513 --> 00:58.946
to the Los Angeles
underground.

00:59.015 --> 01:00.710
Today, still wanted
by the government...

01:00.783 --> 01:02.683
they survive
as soldiers of fortune.

01:02.752 --> 01:05.186
If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...

01:05.254 --> 01:06.585
and if you can find them...

01:06.656 --> 01:08.749
maybe you can hire
the A-Team.

01:08.858 --> 01:11.258
[gun firing]

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:43.486 --> 02:45.044
There you are.
Thanks.

02:45.121 --> 02:46.349
l'd get this oil changed.

02:46.422 --> 02:50.290
Well, like l always say,
healthy engine, healthy truck.

02:50.626 --> 02:52.594
You ladies
have a nice day now, hear?

02:52.662 --> 02:54.061
Thanks, Guss.

02:55.498 --> 02:57.125
[engine starting]

03:28.297 --> 03:29.491
Quiet, huh?

03:29.565 --> 03:32.125
Just thinking
about how much longer
we can hold onto the plant.

03:32.201 --> 03:33.691
l've been going through
these books.

03:33.769 --> 03:35.964
This is the third
straight month
sales have been off.

03:36.038 --> 03:38.336
Maybe we should take
Jason Webb up on his offer.

03:38.474 --> 03:39.771
Give up?

03:40.009 --> 03:43.672
My little sister, the football
player in high school give up?

03:43.746 --> 03:45.805
What happened
to your fighting spirit?

03:45.948 --> 03:47.882
ln football,
we had eleven players.

03:47.950 --> 03:49.884
This team is just
you and me, Maryann.

03:49.952 --> 03:52.079
Well, you have a better way
to go about it?

03:52.188 --> 03:53.485
l might.

03:54.056 --> 03:55.921
Do you want to
tell me about it?

03:58.861 --> 03:59.885
Whoa.

04:02.698 --> 04:03.722
What's the matter?

04:03.799 --> 04:05.994
l don't know.
There's something wrong
with the brakes!

04:06.068 --> 04:07.330
They're not holding!

04:10.673 --> 04:12.402
l don't think l can keep her
on the road.

04:13.509 --> 04:15.033
[tires skidding]

04:16.745 --> 04:18.269
Brace yourself!

04:21.651 --> 04:23.016
[crashing]

04:45.741 --> 04:46.969
[car door slamming]

04:50.746 --> 04:52.373
[panting]

04:54.951 --> 04:56.316
Cathy, are you okay?

04:56.385 --> 04:57.943
Yeah, l guess so.

05:12.234 --> 05:14.099
The brake line's been cut.

05:14.170 --> 05:15.899
Cut? Who could have....

05:15.972 --> 05:18.839
l think
Guss down at the gas station
can give us that answer.

05:19.575 --> 05:22.442
l'll give you one guess
who must have paid him
to do it.

05:24.380 --> 05:28.248
[laughing]
You ladies were lucky
that you weren't killed.

05:28.417 --> 05:31.045
Well, l hope
we haven't disappointed
your boss, Mr. Webb.

05:31.287 --> 05:34.848
Aw, now you aren't inferring
that Mr. Webb had something
to do with this, are you?

05:34.924 --> 05:36.255
The brake line's been cut.

05:36.325 --> 05:38.225
That line looks
like it was cut to you?

05:38.294 --> 05:41.695
Well, if you ask me,
it looks like it got broke
when the truck turned over.

05:41.764 --> 05:43.857
[chuckling]
Just like
a lady truck driver.

05:43.966 --> 05:46.526
Can't hit the downshift
on a little bitty incline.

05:46.802 --> 05:48.497
[all laughing]

05:48.604 --> 05:52.506
You just tell your Webb
that you're not gonna scare us
into selling our plant.

05:52.575 --> 05:54.270
Now you've been lucky so far.

05:55.144 --> 05:57.339
Now you've been made
a fair offer...

05:57.813 --> 05:59.246
and l think
you should take it.

05:59.348 --> 06:02.078
[Cathy screaming]
Whoa!

06:03.319 --> 06:05.014
Whoa!

06:05.788 --> 06:07.688
[all laughing]

06:10.059 --> 06:13.085
You two are not
gonna walk away
from another accident.

06:13.729 --> 06:16.823
So l suggest that you sell out
while you still
have the chance.

06:19.735 --> 06:22.226
These little ladies got themselves
a mess to clean up.

06:22.304 --> 06:23.464
Bye-bye!

06:25.908 --> 06:27.603
[car starting]

06:30.546 --> 06:33.777
l think l've got a way,
Maryann, to get us some help.

06:35.918 --> 06:38.751
You got to admit
this is mighty suspicious,
Cathy.

06:38.821 --> 06:42.416
We just spent $200
on a one-way bus fare...

06:42.491 --> 06:44.823
to get here just to have
some Chinese guy...

06:44.894 --> 06:48.022
tell us that we need
another $200
to find the A-Team.

06:48.097 --> 06:51.533
You analyze too much, Maryann.
Sometimes, you just
got to go with the flow.

06:51.600 --> 06:52.760
This is the one.

06:53.869 --> 06:56.337
Now, we get the money here,
then we wait
for the phone call.

06:56.405 --> 06:58.305
Give me your credit card.
My card?

06:58.474 --> 07:00.965
You're older than me.
You have a higher
credit limit.

07:05.314 --> 07:07.282
Oh, this is the most
ridiculous thing.

07:25.701 --> 07:27.328
Okay, social security number.

07:27.436 --> 07:28.767
861 ...

07:29.071 --> 07:30.163
08...

07:30.406 --> 07:31.532
92...

07:31.907 --> 07:32.896
65.

07:41.851 --> 07:45.014
This A-Team can't be much
if we only need $200.

07:45.087 --> 07:46.076
[shushing]

07:54.597 --> 07:57.760
What do you say, B.A.?
They check, Hannibal.
No connection with the law.

07:57.833 --> 07:59.630
Good. Let's go, Face.

08:04.106 --> 08:05.835
Look at that!
No money.

08:05.908 --> 08:09.400
l told you
this was gonna be a rip-off.
What's this?

08:09.478 --> 08:11.207
''You have just found
the A-Team''?

08:15.518 --> 08:18.487
Hello, l'm Hannibal Smith.
Hi, girls.

08:26.695 --> 08:28.890
(Cathy)
You see, it's really
the natural spring water...

08:28.964 --> 08:30.226
which makes our soda so good.

08:30.299 --> 08:34.462
lt's from the runoff from the
mountain that surrounds Sunset
Valley where our wells are.

08:34.537 --> 08:38.940
You figure
it's the source of your water
this character Webb is after?

08:39.241 --> 08:41.106
lt's hard to tell
what he's after.

08:41.177 --> 08:44.374
But what we do know
is that he's trying to do
everything he possibly can...

08:44.446 --> 08:46.641
to put us out of business
if we don't sell to him.

08:46.715 --> 08:48.478
Well, Hannibal,
breweries do use water.

08:48.551 --> 08:51.611
We've been pretty successful
for the four years
we've been in business.

08:51.687 --> 08:54.019
But with this guy sabotaging
our trucks, our factory...

08:54.089 --> 08:56.250
l don't know how much longer
we can hold on.

08:56.592 --> 08:59.425
Excuse me, but, do you think
you could please not smoke?

08:59.762 --> 09:01.320
[scoffs]
Sorry, ladies.

09:01.397 --> 09:03.092
Cathy and l are into health...

09:03.165 --> 09:05.463
and that's really a habit
you should try and stop.

09:05.534 --> 09:07.627
Nicotine depletes
your Vitamin C...

09:07.703 --> 09:09.762
and it's not good at all
for the nerves.

09:09.939 --> 09:11.236
l don't inhale.

09:11.307 --> 09:13.172
(Murdock)
Colonel,
she's got a point there.

09:13.242 --> 09:15.233
With all the stress
that we go through
every day...

09:15.311 --> 09:18.542
chasing cops, flipping vans,
being the vanguards of justice
and all that...

09:18.614 --> 09:22.277
l mean, l think there might
be something to this health
and vitality stuff.

09:22.451 --> 09:25.614
l mean,
they give us vitamin pills
at the V.A. all the time...

09:25.688 --> 09:27.383
and we're just crazy
about them.

09:27.456 --> 09:29.390
You can say that again.
All of it?

09:29.458 --> 09:32.950
Ah, never mind, Murdock.
Now, can we get down
to the problem at hand?

09:33.229 --> 09:35.595
Look, ladies, l think
you should be aware...

09:35.664 --> 09:38.132
of the fact
that we are rather expensive.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.896
Look, there's no problem.
We've got some money
saved up...

09:40.970 --> 09:43.962
and if we can get Hi-Brite
back on its feet,
we'll have plenty of cash.

09:44.073 --> 09:46.837
Actually, l want
to be honest with you.

09:46.909 --> 09:50.310
l really had no input
into hiring the four of you.

09:50.512 --> 09:53.572
Cathy talked me into it.
l'm not exactly sure that--

09:53.649 --> 09:57.176
Now look, if you're not sure
you want to hire us--
You're hired, okay?

09:57.920 --> 09:59.581
My sister is just
a little leery here.

09:59.688 --> 10:01.952
Looks like Webb's
got the whole town against us.

10:02.024 --> 10:05.619
We can't go to the police,
we've got no witnesses.
You guys have got to help us.

10:06.695 --> 10:08.390
Well, ladies,
in that case...

10:08.631 --> 10:09.859
you've hired the A-Team.

10:09.932 --> 10:12.162
(Face)
Looks like the first thing
we've got to do...

10:12.234 --> 10:13.633
is get you back in business.

10:13.702 --> 10:16.296
Face, we're gonna need
some promotion here.

10:16.372 --> 10:18.567
Well, promotion
is my middle name. Thanks.

10:18.641 --> 10:21.269
l can see it now,
the Templeton Peck Ad Agency.

10:21.343 --> 10:24.005
Hannibal, l think
l can get these machines
in working order.

10:24.079 --> 10:25.205
Good. Murdock'll help you.

10:25.281 --> 10:27.340
Murdock!
Come on, Face,
we've got work to do.

10:27.416 --> 10:30.544
B.A., it's you and me.
You love that. l know you do.

10:30.619 --> 10:33.452
And since l'm hanging
around you, l might as well
start with you.

10:33.522 --> 10:36.889
Start what?
l'm gonna get this team
into shape.

10:36.959 --> 10:40.258
We're gonna eat
the right foods. We're gonna
drink the right liquids.

10:40.396 --> 10:42.296
This team is going
au naturale.

10:42.464 --> 10:43.829
This is all natural, sucker.

10:43.899 --> 10:48.029
And this is the little elixir
of health and vitality
that is gonna do it all.

10:49.071 --> 10:50.936
Why don't you have a sip?
Come on.

10:52.174 --> 10:54.335
Suck on the essence
of vitality.

10:54.410 --> 10:56.810
(Murdock)
Power your battery--

10:56.879 --> 11:00.280
Cathy, l don't believe this.
These guys are nuts.
Listen to them.

11:00.349 --> 11:03.546
A little eccentric, maybe.
They've got great references.

11:03.619 --> 11:07.749
Well, let's see,
running an eight hour shift,
six days a week...

11:08.023 --> 11:11.151
10 bottles a minute,
600 bottles an hour...

11:11.293 --> 11:14.262
200 cases a day,
about 1 100 cases a week.

11:14.330 --> 11:17.231
Of course, that figure will
go up in a sales increase.
Hmm.

11:18.534 --> 11:20.001
How's your credit rating?

11:20.602 --> 11:21.660
Not bad.

11:21.737 --> 11:24.570
We own the building and
we can use it as collateral.
Good.

11:24.640 --> 11:27.074
How about
going down to the bank
and applying for a loan...

11:27.142 --> 11:30.475
so we can have
some working capital?
Deducted from our bill,
of course.

11:34.416 --> 11:38.876
Do l detect a certain, shall
we say, interest in
a certain direction, Hannibal?

11:39.488 --> 11:42.150
Well, Face,
l always like to make friends.

11:42.591 --> 11:45.025
Colonel, l'd like
to lodge a complaint.

11:45.094 --> 11:48.154
B.A. tried to insert
a can of Hi-Brite
into my mouth.

11:48.230 --> 11:50.357
Now, it didn't go in,
but it hurt.

11:50.432 --> 11:53.663
Captain, you said you were
gonna get along with him
this week.

11:53.736 --> 11:55.203
Well, l'm trying to.

11:55.404 --> 11:58.464
Would you like some trail mix?
l got some nice
sun-dried raisins here.

11:58.540 --> 11:59.632
Thanks.

12:00.275 --> 12:03.642
l'm really--
l'm really gonna get behind
this health food stuff.

12:04.747 --> 12:07.807
You know,
once we get into production,
maybe we'll find out why...

12:07.883 --> 12:11.182
a guy who makes beer
is so interested
in a health soda factory.

12:11.553 --> 12:13.987
Uh, you,
would you like a nut?

12:49.558 --> 12:51.958
Boy, she's a real beauty,
isn't she, B.A.?

12:52.060 --> 12:55.552
l mean, the cotton gin,
the steam engine, they may
all have been precursors...

12:55.631 --> 12:57.394
to the industrial revolution,
but nothing...

12:57.466 --> 13:00.299
nothing can beat an MAKR 73...

13:00.369 --> 13:02.963
carbonated bottling machine
with optional labeler.

13:03.205 --> 13:05.002
(Cathy)
Time for lunch, guys.

13:07.609 --> 13:08.940
You'll love 'em.

13:12.648 --> 13:14.809
Where's the meat?
This sandwich's full of weeds.

13:14.883 --> 13:17.784
Those are bean sprouts.
They're great
in the fiber department.

13:18.053 --> 13:19.520
l don't eat nothing
l don't know.

13:19.588 --> 13:22.113
Oh, where's your sense
of adventure, B.A.?
l mean, look at me.

13:22.191 --> 13:24.056
l'm looking at these
itty bitty black things...

13:24.126 --> 13:26.458
l don't know what they are,
but l'm gonna eat them anyway.

13:26.528 --> 13:27.927
Some of them
are even moving.

13:27.996 --> 13:29.361
[giggling]
You're funny.

13:29.431 --> 13:32.798
Just got a call from Hannibal.
The office is all set.

13:33.135 --> 13:36.434
And they're ready to go.
He wants you
to get the machines running...

13:36.572 --> 13:38.767
and they're gonna need
all the soda you can turn out.

13:38.841 --> 13:41.639
See, l told you
it'd work, Maryann.
We're back in business.

13:54.389 --> 13:57.620
(Face)
That's right,
seven delicious fruit flavors.

13:57.726 --> 14:00.957
50 cases? l'll tell you what,
why don't l make it
an even 60, huh?

14:01.029 --> 14:02.496
You'll thank me later.

14:02.564 --> 14:04.555
Great. Yeah.
Thanks for calling.

14:05.667 --> 14:08.363
Yeah, Hi-Brite Soda.
Oh, you saw our ad.

14:08.971 --> 14:11.531
Yeah, oh, you'll love it.
lt's all natural.

14:11.840 --> 14:15.401
l can promise delivery
at your supermarkets
by the end of the week.

14:15.978 --> 14:18.947
Yes, we come
in 16 ounce bottles also.

14:19.181 --> 14:23.345
Uh-huh. 1 20 cases.
You got it.

14:23.552 --> 14:25.713
(Maryann)
Our tangerine lime
is very refreshing.

14:25.787 --> 14:27.914
No, we never use
anything artificial.

14:27.990 --> 14:31.084
lt's sort of kinda
more of a fruit juice
than an actual soft drink.

14:31.560 --> 14:34.961
Right. Very healthy for you.
Got lots of vitamin C.

14:35.697 --> 14:37.824
Thirty-five cases? Great.

14:37.900 --> 14:40.368
(Murdock)
Would you put dirty oil
in your engine? Of course not.

14:40.435 --> 14:44.201
That's why we at Hi-Brite Soda
guarantee that we use
only virgin spring water...

14:44.273 --> 14:48.403
along with that, you get
high complex vitamin C,
along with your bioflavonoids.

14:48.810 --> 14:52.473
25 cases of cherry, good.
What about that grape?

14:52.548 --> 14:54.812
Lot of rutin in grape.
Makes your eyes real shiny.

14:54.883 --> 14:57.317
Good. Ten cases.
Fabulous.

14:58.186 --> 15:00.279
Hi-Brite Soda?
What can we do for you?

15:00.856 --> 15:03.347
Looks like Face's ad campaign
is starting to pay off.

15:03.825 --> 15:07.226
Yeah. This keeps up, we'll
get back in full production
in a couple of days.

15:07.563 --> 15:10.532
l'd like to see Webb's face
when he finds out.

15:10.599 --> 15:12.726
(Webb)
What do you mean
they're back in business?

15:12.801 --> 15:15.201
Yeah, l know l told you
l shut them down.

15:15.337 --> 15:16.964
Well, l don't know.

15:17.105 --> 15:18.868
Okay, okay,
we'll get on it.

15:19.141 --> 15:21.939
[machines whirring]

15:23.345 --> 15:24.710
[bottles clinking]

15:29.851 --> 15:30.840
Hey!

15:32.487 --> 15:36.048
Hi-Brite just took out
a bank loan to pay
for the ad agency they hired.

15:37.759 --> 15:40.159
How many cases did you see?
At least 300, Mr. Webb.

15:40.228 --> 15:43.220
l got a call from this guy
who works in one of
the Farrell Supermarkets.

15:43.298 --> 15:45.664
He says they're stocking
Hi-Brite Soda
in all their outlets.

15:45.734 --> 15:47.998
They're expecting to deliver
by the middle of the week.

15:48.070 --> 15:49.833
They gotta get their trucks
through first.

15:49.905 --> 15:51.896
Yeah, that's right.
They got to get through first.

15:51.974 --> 15:54.568
l want every road
out of that factory
watched round the clock.

15:54.643 --> 15:56.304
You see one Hi-Brite truck
on the road...

15:56.378 --> 15:58.243
l want you to make sure
it smashes into a wall.

15:58.313 --> 16:00.611
l promise you,
not one of them trucks
is gonna get through.

16:00.682 --> 16:03.207
They better not.
l don't care how many cases
they got on order.

16:03.285 --> 16:05.116
They don't deliver,
they close down.

16:14.796 --> 16:18.061
(Murdock)
This is genius. Pure genius!
Thank you, Murdock.

16:18.333 --> 16:20.961
No, l was referring
to Hannibal's part.

16:21.069 --> 16:24.596
What're you talking about?
l'm the guy who figured out
how to do this.

16:24.773 --> 16:26.172
Want some trail mix?
No, l don't.

16:26.241 --> 16:28.232
Some nuts?
Almonds?
l don't want anything.

16:28.310 --> 16:30.278
Calm your nerves.
My nerves are fine.

16:30.345 --> 16:31.744
l'll be waiting for you.
Good.

16:31.813 --> 16:32.939
l'll be here.
Great.

16:33.015 --> 16:34.642
l'll be seeing you.

16:34.716 --> 16:38.015
[engine starting]
l'll be looking for you
when you come back.

17:06.615 --> 17:10.574
Boy, oh, boy!
My first day on the job,
you talk about luck.

17:11.353 --> 17:13.719
Hi, l'm Happy Harrison.
Yeah.

17:14.321 --> 17:17.689
l'll tell you, talk about
lucky, l got the local run.
What'd you get?

17:17.759 --> 17:22.492
Yeah, l see your run takes you
all the way up to Fresno, huh?

17:22.564 --> 17:25.294
Yeah. You got the local?
Yeah.

17:25.701 --> 17:27.862
l can't say l'm not
just a little disappointed!

17:27.935 --> 17:31.872
See, l know this great gal
up there, l tell you.

17:32.207 --> 17:33.799
Hey, wait a minute.

17:34.643 --> 17:38.773
lf they think l'm taking
this load 300 miles
on short notice...

17:38.847 --> 17:40.906
they're out of
their ever loving minds!

17:41.016 --> 17:43.416
Well, l don't know about that.
See, l just--
You take it!

17:43.485 --> 17:44.474
What?

17:44.553 --> 17:47.545
You got orders,
you're new.
Yeah.

17:47.622 --> 17:49.453
You take the load.

17:49.558 --> 17:53.517
Oh, l get it. lt's kind of
like job seniority.

17:53.662 --> 17:56.529
No, it's called
keeping your job.

17:56.698 --> 17:57.858
Right.

17:57.933 --> 17:59.127
[laughing]

18:15.150 --> 18:17.050
[engine starting]

18:22.758 --> 18:25.625
[engine starting]

18:42.377 --> 18:43.935
Let's go fishing.

18:57.826 --> 19:00.522
[ The old gray mare,
she ain't what
she used to be [

19:00.595 --> 19:03.689
[ Ain't what she used to be,
ain't what she used to be [

19:04.699 --> 19:07.759
[ The old gray mare,
she ain't what
she used to be [

19:07.836 --> 19:10.999
[ Many long years ago [[

19:11.072 --> 19:12.061
[braying]

19:15.076 --> 19:16.634
lt's about time!

19:21.216 --> 19:24.481
l was getting worried.
l mean, l've gone through
a whole bag of trail mix.

19:24.553 --> 19:26.578
Murdock, this calls
for a celebration.

19:26.655 --> 19:28.714
Why are you
doing this to yourself?

19:28.824 --> 19:31.054
Aw, come on, you're not
gonna start again.

19:31.126 --> 19:34.493
Faceman, l'm only
concerned about your
cardiovascular system.

19:34.563 --> 19:36.758
Do you realize you're taking
into your lungs...

19:36.832 --> 19:39.300
foul disgusting dead matter?

19:39.367 --> 19:41.767
Man, l've about had it
with all this health stuff!

19:41.837 --> 19:43.862
Well, l find that offensive.

19:43.972 --> 19:44.961
What?

19:45.140 --> 19:48.007
Nothing.
lt's just something that
Custer said to the lndian.

19:48.076 --> 19:49.668
Don't think about it.

19:59.387 --> 20:01.514
Hey, Hannibal,
l think we got a bite.

20:29.117 --> 20:30.584
[groaning]

20:36.057 --> 20:37.649
[gun firing]

20:53.842 --> 20:55.036
You guys are crazy.

20:55.110 --> 20:57.442
Oh, he's an excellent judge
of character, huh, Colonel?

20:57.512 --> 21:01.107
The Hi-Brite Soda company
is still in business and
we're still making deliveries.

21:01.316 --> 21:03.409
(Murdock)
Colonel, may l?

21:03.818 --> 21:07.754
Gentlemen, it's quite obvious
from the very sloppy handling
of an operation...

21:07.822 --> 21:10.586
as simple as
running our truck
off the road...

21:10.659 --> 21:14.857
that you gentlemen
are suffering from
severe vitamin deficiencies.

21:15.030 --> 21:17.055
You are not operating
at your peak.

21:17.132 --> 21:19.692
Therefore, l want you
to listen and l want you
to listen good.

21:19.768 --> 21:22.999
Because, in order
to complete this assignment,
this is what you must do.

21:23.338 --> 21:26.398
First of all,
you must have a weapon.

21:26.875 --> 21:29.469
Second of all,
you must check
chamber of said weapon...

21:29.544 --> 21:31.068
for possible
mechanical blockage.

21:31.146 --> 21:32.272
[gun cocking]

21:32.347 --> 21:34.838
Thirdly, you must aim
said weapon...

21:34.916 --> 21:38.113
at approximately
a 45 degree angle...

21:38.353 --> 21:40.321
at the rear of said truck.

21:42.624 --> 21:44.353
And then, you must fire.

21:44.592 --> 21:46.457
Oh, that is the gas tank,
you know.

21:54.102 --> 21:55.126
Nice, Captain.

21:59.274 --> 22:02.437
Now, you go back
and you tell your boss...

22:03.011 --> 22:06.572
if he's got problems with this
to talk to me.
My name's Smith.

22:08.049 --> 22:09.380
Now start walking.

22:25.734 --> 22:28.601
Hey, big guy.
l have a question for you.

22:28.803 --> 22:32.967
Don't you think that
Faceman should've highlighted
the name a bit more?

22:33.074 --> 22:34.974
l mean,
it's missing something,
don't you think?

22:35.043 --> 22:37.807
l think that the gold
should have been radiating...

22:37.879 --> 22:40.848
more outwards
so that the flow
catches the eye...

22:40.915 --> 22:43.440
before the eye catches
the hard copy.
What do you think, big guy?

22:43.518 --> 22:45.543
l think if you don't stop
flapping your lips...

22:45.620 --> 22:47.781
l'm gonna highlight your head
black and blue!

22:47.856 --> 22:49.721
(Maryann)
l've got to start to
give you credit.

22:49.791 --> 22:51.281
l mean,
the campaign's working.

22:51.359 --> 22:53.953
The way the orders
are coming in,
we're gonna have to put on...

22:54.029 --> 22:55.724
another shift
by the end of the week.

22:55.797 --> 22:58.630
You guys are unreal.
l mean, is there
anything you can't do?

22:58.700 --> 23:00.725
Ballet.
We stopped going to class.

23:00.802 --> 23:03.828
l figure when Webb gets
our message, he's gonna
pay us a little visit.

23:03.905 --> 23:06.203
And you're convinced
there's something
in Webb's office...

23:06.274 --> 23:08.139
that's gonna
tell us something.
Oh, yeah.

23:08.209 --> 23:11.337
Face reported
much too much security
for just an ordinary office.

23:11.413 --> 23:13.074
What, do you think
they'll come here?

23:13.148 --> 23:15.343
The sucker better have
health insurance if he do.

23:15.417 --> 23:16.850
Oh, speaking of health...

23:16.918 --> 23:20.183
l've drawn up that
vitamin supplement program
l'm gonna put you on.

23:20.255 --> 23:22.348
Yeah, l know you're strong,
l know you're strong...

23:22.424 --> 23:25.825
but, you can't spend the rest
of your days lifting
automobiles over your head.

23:25.894 --> 23:28.761
Now, what l suggest
is a high-potency multi.

23:28.830 --> 23:32.095
Something that's gonna
cover all basic nine
minerals and vitamins.

23:32.167 --> 23:34.761
Give you calcium, magnesium--
Give me that, fool!

23:37.539 --> 23:38.938
[chuckling]

23:39.107 --> 23:41.541
Of course,
on the other hand,
a balanced diet...

23:41.609 --> 23:44.009
cuts the need for vitamin
supplements in half.
B.A.?

23:44.479 --> 23:45.969
ls Face all set?
Yeah.

23:46.314 --> 23:48.248
All ready and wired to go.

23:48.383 --> 23:51.147
Good. Now, all Webb needs...

23:51.219 --> 23:52.846
is a personal invitation.

23:52.921 --> 23:54.821
(Webb)
What do you mean,
it hasn't been delivered?

23:54.889 --> 23:56.447
l saw all my trucks
go out this morning.

23:56.524 --> 23:57.923
[phone ringing]
Yes?

23:59.227 --> 24:00.626
lt didn't make the stop?

24:00.795 --> 24:03.923
l don't know what's going on.
Look, l'll get on it.
Don't worry.

24:05.066 --> 24:08.092
First you three get
my trucks blown up...

24:08.169 --> 24:10.729
and now, my beers
are not getting delivered.

24:10.805 --> 24:12.295
What do l look like,
some kind of jerk?

24:12.373 --> 24:14.204
You wind me up in circles
and l turn around?

24:14.275 --> 24:16.607
Mr. Webb,
you better come quick.

24:23.818 --> 24:25.183
They switched trucks.

24:25.286 --> 24:29.017
That's what they meant
when they said we'd be making
their deliveries for them.

24:29.190 --> 24:32.318
A-Team?
They are those military guys
wanted by the government.

24:32.393 --> 24:34.122
Well, l don't care
who they are!

24:34.829 --> 24:36.956
They use my drivers
to deliver their soda...

24:37.031 --> 24:39.898
they shoot up
one of my trucks,
they're ruining my business!

24:39.968 --> 24:42.562
lt's that ad campaign,
Mr. Webb. lt's killing us.

24:42.637 --> 24:44.002
Well, who's running it
for them?

24:44.072 --> 24:46.302
A guy named
Templeton Peck.
Find him!

24:46.374 --> 24:47.398
That's right.

24:47.475 --> 24:49.841
That's right, l want three
of those big billboards...

24:49.911 --> 24:51.811
like you see on l-Five.

24:51.880 --> 24:54.781
Exactly. Now--
Let me get back to you
on this.

24:55.350 --> 24:56.339
[phone thudding]

24:56.417 --> 24:58.510
Hold all my calls,
Miss Olsen.

25:03.558 --> 25:04.923
[doorbell buzzing]

25:07.028 --> 25:09.087
So, you're Templeton Peck,
huh?

25:09.164 --> 25:10.256
l've heard a lot about you.

25:10.331 --> 25:13.300
You're the guy
who runs the ad campaign
for the Hi-Brite Soda company.

25:13.368 --> 25:15.859
Yes, yes, indeed l do,
and may l...

25:15.937 --> 25:18.701
take a few minutes
here to tell you that...

25:18.973 --> 25:22.170
well, with my agency's help,
we've managed to...

25:22.243 --> 25:25.235
triple business
in the local market here.

25:26.848 --> 25:29.908
Yeah, you see, advertising,
that's the secret.

25:29.984 --> 25:33.943
All the quality beer
in the world would just
sit on the shelf...

25:34.055 --> 25:36.216
if it wasn't for advertising.

25:36.591 --> 25:38.183
You have to have a demand...

25:38.259 --> 25:41.057
and demand, well,
it doesn't just happen,
you know...

25:41.129 --> 25:42.619
it has to be created.

25:42.697 --> 25:43.789
That's right...

25:43.865 --> 25:46.425
you see, and that,
my friend, is advertising.

25:47.068 --> 25:48.433
[watch beeping]

25:48.937 --> 25:51.428
Yes, the right kind
of advertising...

25:51.506 --> 25:53.974
can make or break a company
and that's what to expect...

25:54.042 --> 25:56.033
from Templeton Peck.
Good.

25:56.244 --> 25:59.771
You're hired.
Here's $10,000.

26:00.048 --> 26:02.039
Gee, $10,000.

26:02.116 --> 26:03.583
With money like this,
we could...

26:03.651 --> 26:06.211
we could probably set up
some accounts and
go national--

26:06.287 --> 26:07.686
You don't understand,
Mr. Peck.

26:07.755 --> 26:10.417
l want you to spend
all that money
on the Hi-Brite account.

26:10.491 --> 26:11.617
The Hi-Brite account?

26:11.693 --> 26:13.354
l want you to put them
out of business.

26:13.428 --> 26:14.861
Yeah, but--
Look...

26:15.597 --> 26:17.428
there's $10,000 here.

26:17.632 --> 26:18.929
Mr. Webb...

26:19.100 --> 26:23.093
if you think l can be bribed
to sabotage an ad campaign....

26:23.171 --> 26:24.570
You got 24 hours.

26:24.872 --> 26:26.464
lf l don't see some results...

26:26.608 --> 26:28.166
you're going to a funeral.

26:28.376 --> 26:29.365
Your own.

26:35.250 --> 26:37.115
(Face)
Hannibal,
l don't like to complain...

26:37.185 --> 26:39.983
but why is it
that l'm always the one...

26:40.054 --> 26:43.251
who has to stick his head
inside the lion's mouth?

26:43.324 --> 26:45.315
(Hannibal)
lt's your personality.
Personality.

26:45.393 --> 26:48.624
Look, in 24 hours,
l'm a dead man unless l can...

26:48.696 --> 26:52.530
turn this Hi-Brite Soda
ad campaign around cold.

26:52.600 --> 26:53.589
Oh, yeah.

26:53.668 --> 26:56.000
Webb's donation
to the world of advertising.

26:59.040 --> 27:00.200
Pays our fee.

27:00.642 --> 27:01.802
Did you find anything?

27:01.876 --> 27:05.209
Oh, yeah, yeah.
The way this metal detector
went off in Webb's office...

27:05.280 --> 27:07.043
there's a safe
in there somewhere.

27:07.181 --> 27:09.240
Probably behind the screen
in the corner.

27:09.884 --> 27:11.476
There's only one way
to find out.

27:12.086 --> 27:13.075
Murdock...

27:13.655 --> 27:14.747
go with Face.

27:20.762 --> 27:21.751
[bell ringing]

30:10.565 --> 30:11.793
[camera clicks]

30:13.868 --> 30:15.768
[whispering]
l love you, baby.

30:20.107 --> 30:22.302
One chimpanzee,
two chimpanzees,
three chimpan--

30:22.376 --> 30:24.936
What are you doing?
l'm counting chimpanzees,
do you mind?

30:25.012 --> 30:26.036
Three chimpanzee--

30:26.113 --> 30:27.740
l thought
it was one Mississippi,
two--

30:27.815 --> 30:29.339
No, that's when they're taking
your pulse.

30:29.417 --> 30:31.385
lt's chimpanzees when you take
time exposures.

30:31.452 --> 30:33.977
Five chimpanzees,
six chimpanzees,
ten chimpanzees.

30:34.055 --> 30:35.488
Watch this.

30:38.426 --> 30:39.757
lt's perfect.

31:29.443 --> 31:31.877
l got faith in you,
little brother.

31:36.450 --> 31:37.474
[buzzing]

31:37.552 --> 31:38.541
[clicking]

31:38.619 --> 31:39.847
Voila.

32:25.766 --> 32:27.097
Look.

32:27.168 --> 32:30.660
They all have names of
businesses in the Valley
on them.

32:30.938 --> 32:32.064
Yeah.

32:32.239 --> 32:34.833
Right here, in the center,
the Hi-Brite Soda factory.

32:35.409 --> 32:37.900
Well, the Colonel ought to
see this, look.

32:38.512 --> 32:40.309
All of these checks...

32:40.381 --> 32:42.042
have names that correspond...

32:42.116 --> 32:43.583
to the businesses on this map.

32:43.651 --> 32:45.551
Look's like Webb's trying to
buy up the Valley.

32:45.620 --> 32:47.520
Except this one here...

32:47.755 --> 32:50.155
made out to the Palmdale
Construction Company.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.161
[alarm ringing]

33:12.246 --> 33:13.770
[gun firing]

33:26.594 --> 33:28.323
[tires screeching]

33:45.646 --> 33:48.240
lf only l'd had
my extra stress vitamin B's...

33:48.315 --> 33:51.807
l know l could've held
them off a couple of hours.
Maybe, even a day or two.

33:51.886 --> 33:54.081
lmportant thing is,
we've got this check.

33:54.155 --> 33:56.919
Yeah, l got a real queasy
feeling in my stomach,
Hannibal.

33:56.991 --> 33:58.618
Webb knows about the break-in.

33:58.693 --> 33:59.921
You're right.

34:00.094 --> 34:02.119
lt's not part of the plan,
Face.

34:03.164 --> 34:05.029
Oh, Colonel, not a cigar.

34:05.833 --> 34:07.300
The nicotine...

34:07.368 --> 34:09.460
it depletes your vitamin C.

34:12.973 --> 34:15.237
(Drake)
lt had to be those guys
that blew up your truck.

34:15.309 --> 34:16.469
The A-Team.

34:16.543 --> 34:18.978
l don't get it.
How did they know
about the safe?

34:19.780 --> 34:21.179
You know, it's funny.

34:21.248 --> 34:24.945
These guys showed up, just
about the same time that the
Roger sisters hired this...

34:25.018 --> 34:26.007
Peck character...

34:26.087 --> 34:28.214
and his campaign turned
the whole thing around.

34:28.289 --> 34:30.757
Do you think this Peck
and those guys are connected?

34:30.925 --> 34:33.085
All l know is that
his 24 hours are up.

34:33.159 --> 34:35.958
We're supposed to
meet him at his office,
and l'll tell you this...

34:36.030 --> 34:39.625
he better show us he put
the brakes on the Hi-Brite
ad campaign, or he's dead.

34:45.606 --> 34:47.039
[crashing]

34:48.509 --> 34:50.601
l should've known
l couldn't trust that guy!

34:50.678 --> 34:52.202
We'll find him,
Mr. Webb.

35:01.055 --> 35:03.216
l think we just found him.

35:22.643 --> 35:25.635
Our friend, Mr. Peck,
is gonna have a lot
of questions to answer.

35:25.713 --> 35:29.274
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
our camera will reveal...

35:29.583 --> 35:31.983
which of the soft drinks
our subjects have chosen.

35:32.052 --> 35:35.215
Will it be can A,
can B, or can C?

35:35.790 --> 35:38.816
Yes, l see all three subjects
have chosen...

35:39.393 --> 35:40.382
can A.

35:40.561 --> 35:42.927
And can A is....

35:44.865 --> 35:47.925
Yes! Hi-Brite soda.

35:48.369 --> 35:49.893
[all clapping]

35:53.107 --> 35:56.508
Well, l see our second group
of taste testers
have just arrived.

35:56.844 --> 35:59.210
(Face)
l'm sure everybody
out there recognizes...

35:59.280 --> 36:01.771
Mr. Jason Webb,
owner of Webb Beers.

36:01.849 --> 36:04.079
Now Mr. Webb, has
graciously consented...

36:04.151 --> 36:06.813
to be one of our
sample taste testers.

36:07.054 --> 36:09.045
Your clock has just
wound down, buddy.

36:09.123 --> 36:11.648
l don't think so.
Smile, you're on TV.

36:12.560 --> 36:14.755
And now, Mr. Webb,
if you will kindly...

36:14.829 --> 36:16.763
step over
to the tasting table.

36:16.864 --> 36:18.593
No, l've got to go.

36:20.034 --> 36:21.092
[clearing throat]

36:28.475 --> 36:29.999
(Murdock)
l sure am glad that...

36:30.077 --> 36:31.977
construction companies
aren't open on Saturdays.

36:32.046 --> 36:33.911
l would've had to
take them on single-handedly.

36:33.981 --> 36:36.814
You couldn't take on
a bunch of Girl Scouts
single-handedly.

36:36.884 --> 36:39.079
Niacin. You're low on niacin.

36:39.286 --> 36:41.618
You know why?
Because you're grouchy,
and depressed.

36:41.689 --> 36:43.247
But l understand.
l understand. Here...

36:43.324 --> 36:45.315
here big guy.
You just take two of these...

36:45.392 --> 36:46.859
after every meal...

36:46.927 --> 36:49.225
and you're gonna be smiling,
from ear to ear...

36:49.296 --> 36:51.389
clicking your heels
a three-quarter time.

36:52.199 --> 36:54.064
Hey, guys. Look what l found.

37:01.008 --> 37:02.236
What is it?

37:04.311 --> 37:07.508
This is a lake shore
condo development.

37:08.816 --> 37:10.147
Look at these streets.

37:10.217 --> 37:11.912
(Hannibal)
Sutton, Verdugo...

37:11.986 --> 37:15.149
those are the streets
that run past the Hi-Brite
Soda factory.

37:15.489 --> 37:16.888
So where's the soda plant?

37:17.224 --> 37:18.885
l guess it was right about...

37:19.393 --> 37:21.953
here. Right in the middle
of the lake, underwater.

37:22.029 --> 37:23.792
Those dummies think...

37:24.098 --> 37:26.726
they can use the springs
under the Hi-Brite factory...

37:26.800 --> 37:28.825
to form a man made lake...

37:29.336 --> 37:31.361
and sell condos
on the shore line.

37:31.739 --> 37:33.172
No wonder they...

37:33.240 --> 37:35.572
they bought all the property
around the Hi-Brite plant.

37:35.643 --> 37:37.941
Webb hasn't got the money
to do a project this big.

37:38.012 --> 37:39.912
There'd have to be a backer
or a money man.

37:39.980 --> 37:41.345
Look at this, Colonel.

37:41.582 --> 37:44.312
Here are the loan papers
for the construction
of the condo...

37:44.385 --> 37:46.444
and guess who's
loaning them the money.

37:46.587 --> 37:48.487
The Valley View Bank.

37:48.555 --> 37:51.956
That's the same bank
that loaned the money to the--
To the girls.

37:58.032 --> 37:59.863
(Barrington)
Ladies.

37:59.934 --> 38:01.595
How can l help you?

38:01.669 --> 38:04.365
We just stopped by,
Mr. Barrington, to repay
our loan.

38:04.438 --> 38:06.702
Business has been so good...

38:06.907 --> 38:09.307
we can afford
to repay our loan early.

38:09.376 --> 38:10.536
l see.

38:10.945 --> 38:15.143
Well, l'm afraid
there's a slight problem here.

38:15.215 --> 38:17.775
lt seems you just
defaulted on your loan.

38:31.131 --> 38:33.497
Hannibal, you should've seen
the look on Webb's face.

38:33.567 --> 38:35.296
l don't think
the man likes soda.

38:35.402 --> 38:37.666
Where are the girls?
l sent them down
to the bank...

38:37.738 --> 38:39.262
to see Mr. Barrington.
Barrington.

38:39.340 --> 38:41.274
There's no need
to build up interest.

38:41.342 --> 38:43.708
Barrington is the guy
who's behind all this.

38:45.913 --> 38:48.473
(Barrington)
This whole matter
could have resolved itself...

38:48.549 --> 38:50.676
had you ladies not been
so obstinate...

38:50.751 --> 38:52.343
as to hire the A-Team.

38:52.886 --> 38:55.184
You mean, we just
let you take over the plant...

38:55.255 --> 38:56.745
and force us into selling.

38:58.025 --> 39:00.789
There's no way you're gonna
get away with this.
Oh, no?

39:02.096 --> 39:04.621
There are certain loose ends
that need to be tied...

39:04.698 --> 39:06.393
but we can take care of that.

39:06.467 --> 39:07.764
[phone ringing]

39:12.006 --> 39:13.098
Yes.

39:15.175 --> 39:16.574
Well, where?

39:18.512 --> 39:20.537
All right, l'll handle it.

39:22.750 --> 39:24.877
That was Marlowe
at the construction site.

39:24.952 --> 39:27.113
Someone broke
into his trailer.

39:27.187 --> 39:28.814
They found the loan papers.

39:28.889 --> 39:31.949
The A-Team. They're probably
on their way over here
right now.

39:32.192 --> 39:35.753
Then l think we should prepare
a proper welcome
for them then.

39:36.196 --> 39:40.462
Miss Reynolds, if a Mr. Smith
calls, tell him we've gone
to the brewery.

39:47.474 --> 39:50.910
Barrington left word
he could be found
at Webb's Brewery.

39:51.045 --> 39:53.275
Left word?
Yeah.

39:53.647 --> 39:57.777
And his secretary said
that he saw him take
Maryann and Cathy with him.

39:57.851 --> 40:01.753
Why do l get the feeling l'm
one of the six hundred riding
into the valley of death?

40:01.822 --> 40:04.313
Barrington and the others
are going to be
waiting for us.

40:04.391 --> 40:07.724
l feel an anxiety attack
coming on. This is
a very stressful situation...

40:07.828 --> 40:10.626
lt's time for my B-1 2 anyway.
You want one?
No.

40:11.965 --> 40:13.523
Oh, what are we going to do?

40:13.867 --> 40:18.167
Since Barrington is so anxious
to take over
a soda pop plant...

40:18.672 --> 40:21.072
why don't we
give him a taste
of what he wants?

40:21.542 --> 40:23.908
All seven flavors?
Why not?

40:47.835 --> 40:49.769
[whirring]

41:08.622 --> 41:09.611
[drilling]

41:58.338 --> 42:00.465
[hissing]

42:13.987 --> 42:15.978
When all this unpleasantness
is over...

42:16.056 --> 42:18.115
l don't want any
of them found, understand?

42:18.192 --> 42:20.387
Don't worry, they won't be.

42:22.496 --> 42:24.157
You guys all right up there?

42:24.264 --> 42:25.356
[car approaching]

42:25.532 --> 42:27.022
They're coming!

42:34.374 --> 42:35.636
[brakes squeal]

42:37.444 --> 42:38.843
l see you were expecting us.

42:38.912 --> 42:41.574
Well, l like to be ready
for any contingency.

42:41.648 --> 42:43.639
You've caused me
a great deal of trouble.

42:43.717 --> 42:47.551
We have, haven't we?
And you know what?
You haven't seen anything yet?

42:47.754 --> 42:49.415
Kill them!
Wait a minute.

42:49.489 --> 42:51.719
Where's the skinny guy
with the baseball hat?

42:52.359 --> 42:54.850
l was waiting for you to ask.
Murdock!

42:55.195 --> 42:56.992
Seven all-natural flavors.

42:57.064 --> 42:58.053
[hissing]

42:58.131 --> 43:01.066
The A-Team's way of saying
don't fool with Mother Nature.

43:01.134 --> 43:03.034
[guns firing]

43:17.284 --> 43:18.774
[guns firing]

43:36.470 --> 43:37.869
[gun firing]

43:39.673 --> 43:40.833
[tires screeching]

43:46.813 --> 43:47.802
[grunting]

44:02.195 --> 44:04.163
lt's all right, ladies,
it's all right.

44:04.231 --> 44:05.562
Oh, thank you.

44:05.832 --> 44:06.821
[sighing]

44:07.801 --> 44:08.790
[thudding]

44:10.304 --> 44:12.738
l love it
when a plan comes together.

44:19.012 --> 44:21.310
Well, with Webb and
Barrington out of the way...

44:21.381 --> 44:23.906
you shouldn't have
any trouble
marketing your soda.

44:23.984 --> 44:27.511
Now that business is over,
let's get down to basics,
like...

44:27.621 --> 44:29.748
a candlelight dinner,
a little cognac?

44:29.823 --> 44:31.757
l know this terrific Hungarian
restaurant.

44:31.892 --> 44:35.157
Well, do they have
a gypsy violinist?
Of course they do.

44:35.662 --> 44:36.924
[clearing throat]

44:37.064 --> 44:39.999
Well, l have to admit,
l was wrong about you, Smith.

44:40.067 --> 44:42.365
The A-Team definitely know
what they're doing.

44:42.436 --> 44:44.597
l'm sorry l ever doubted you.

44:44.671 --> 44:46.764
l hope you can
accept my apologies.

44:46.840 --> 44:48.273
l'll look forward to it.

44:48.342 --> 44:50.435
Sometimes there's
a method in our madness.

44:50.510 --> 44:52.307
Speaking of madness.

44:58.018 --> 44:59.918
Excuse me, ladies.

45:00.454 --> 45:02.945
Gentlemen,
l have put down on paper...

45:03.023 --> 45:05.548
a vitamin and diet
supplement program...

45:05.625 --> 45:09.391
which l believe to the
very best of my ability,
compliments your personal...

45:09.496 --> 45:13.330
metabolic and caloric needs
to sustain
health and vitality.

45:15.202 --> 45:19.161
Face, for you, iron.
A lot of iron.

45:22.275 --> 45:24.903
Colonel,
you have the gray matter.

45:25.946 --> 45:29.109
Fortified with trace elements
and minerals, sir.

45:29.750 --> 45:31.411
Thanks, Murdock.

45:31.952 --> 45:34.648
And B.A. we know
you've got the bulk, baby.

45:34.721 --> 45:37.884
We all know that.
You're strong. But,
what you lack is endurance.

45:37.991 --> 45:39.788
Now, l've worked out
a program here...

45:39.860 --> 45:42.488
that's going
to keep your muscles
at peak proficiency.

45:43.397 --> 45:44.796
Thank you.

45:44.865 --> 45:47.333
And l got
something special for you.

45:47.467 --> 45:50.027
This is my
B.A. all-purpose...

45:50.103 --> 45:51.832
multi body-building tablet.
