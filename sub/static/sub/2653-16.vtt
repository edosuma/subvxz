00:01.635 --> 00:03.171
Okay, big day for this household.

00:03.237 --> 00:06.480
It certainly is. So exciting.
Nothing like starting a new job.

00:06.540 --> 00:09.077
Or finally coming into your own
at a job you already have.

00:09.143 --> 00:11.453
- The promise of something new.
- Oh.

00:11.512 --> 00:14.254
- The rewards of finally being-
- To opposite things being equally good.

00:14.315 --> 00:15.953
- Cheers.
- Yes.

00:16.017 --> 00:20.227
I have accepted a job at the CFJ-
the Center for Justice.

00:20.287 --> 00:23.268
Not, it turns out,
a secret headquarters for superheroes.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.326
Aw, no, it- it kind of is.

00:25.393 --> 00:28.840
It's a legal aid society
founded by a law school friend of mine.

00:28.896 --> 00:33.242
I will be an advocate for the people,
a voice for the voiceless.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.678
- And just as important-
- Oh, thank you.

00:35.736 --> 00:38.580
Tonight I'm chaperoning
the Spring-A-Ding-Fling...

00:38.639 --> 00:40.312
a fund-raiser, a dance...

00:40.374 --> 00:43.548
which, under my stewardship,
has shattered school records.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.522
And I added the "A-Ding."

00:45.579 --> 00:49.391
Used to just be called the Spring Fling.

00:49.450 --> 00:51.862
I should have said my thing first.

00:53.421 --> 00:54.957
Hey, guys.

00:55.022 --> 00:57.502
For my opening number tonight-
Be honest-

00:57.558 --> 00:59.868
Does it look like I have
anything on under this?

01:01.562 --> 01:03.166
- Tonight is the SCARB.
- Mmm.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.870
Southern California
Annual Realtors' Banquet.

01:05.933 --> 01:08.413
It is the banquet
for Southern California Realtors.

01:08.469 --> 01:10.107
Literally, it's the only one.

01:10.171 --> 01:12.617
And this guy is the only two-time host-

01:12.673 --> 01:15.711
- Three-time.
- Three-time host in the history of the event.

01:15.776 --> 01:18.017
Unfortunately, I have to miss it this year.

01:18.079 --> 01:20.286
It's for the best.
She's invisible at these things.

01:20.347 --> 01:22.793
It's tough being married
to the rock star.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.126
Luckily, I lined up a substitute date.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.790
- Dad. You're still up.
- Hey.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.731
Just working on some jokes
for the banquet.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.359
How'd you like to come with me?

01:30.424 --> 01:32.131
I would love to!

01:32.193 --> 01:34.764
Not surprised she said yes.
That girl's got real estate in her blood.

01:34.829 --> 01:37.400
She used to come with me
to open houses when she was little.

01:37.465 --> 01:40.503
We may have even talked about
a father/daughter partnership.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.309
Yeah, she's been drifting a little lately...

01:42.369 --> 01:45.009
but I think a taste of regional real estate's
most glamorous night...

01:45.072 --> 01:48.053
might just reignite that flame.

01:48.109 --> 01:50.180
I can't believe
I have to go to this thing.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.746
But what choice did I have?

01:51.812 --> 01:53.689
I would love to!

01:53.747 --> 01:56.353
But you're not gonna
have those cookies without milk, right?

01:56.417 --> 01:58.795
Right. Come on, Phil!

02:20.141 --> 02:22.883
- My stinky dog.
- Oh, look at you.

02:22.943 --> 02:25.423
You just threw up recently. Okay.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.255
Oh, my gosh.
That's you and Michelle Obama.

02:28.315 --> 02:30.352
- That's my aunt.
- I am so sorry.

02:30.417 --> 02:32.522
- I don't know why I thought that-
- Calm down, white guilt.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.759
- It's Michelle Obama.
- Oh, good, yeah.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.961
Yeah, you've accomplished a lot
in 15 years.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.526
Professionally, yeah.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.731
I haven't had a date in six months.

02:40.794 --> 02:43.297
Some Sundays,
I drive out to visit my frozen eggs.

02:43.364 --> 02:46.868
But on the plus side,
I have gotten really close with my mom.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.743
Oh, look at that. I see the resemblance.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.213
- That's Maya Angelou.
- Damn it.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.376
- It's signed, Mitch.
- Oh. Yeah. I see that.

02:52.439 --> 02:54.248
- This is gonna be fun!
- I know!

02:54.308 --> 02:56.083
- I'm just really looking for-
- You!

02:56.143 --> 02:57.645
What was that outfit last night?

02:57.711 --> 02:59.213
That was a business dinner!

02:59.280 --> 03:01.123
- What is wrong with you?
- Wendy, I tried.

03:01.182 --> 03:03.822
Well, try harder. Go, go.

03:03.884 --> 03:06.091
- Ooh, here's your office.
- Okay.

03:06.153 --> 03:08.155
- Oh, this is nice.
- Yeah.

03:08.222 --> 03:10.725
Dennis liked it... until he didn't.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.600
- I'll check on you later.
- Okay.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.571
All right.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.904
Let's see here.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.307
- Huh.
- New guy?

03:21.368 --> 03:22.972
Uh, yes. Hi. I'm Mitchell Pritchett.

03:23.037 --> 03:25.847
Dan. Hope you don't have any plans
for Sunday night-

03:25.906 --> 03:27.852
Dan! What are you still doing here?

03:27.908 --> 03:29.478
- Go!
- Sorry.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.886
- Huh!
- Right.

03:30.945 --> 03:32.447
That way!

03:33.681 --> 03:36.252
Ha.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.955
So-

03:38.018 --> 03:39.520
Oh, no.

03:43.857 --> 03:46.064
I do love it in leather.

03:46.126 --> 03:47.662
Well, learn to love it in silk.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.901
It's too hot outside
to be wearing leather.

03:49.964 --> 03:51.807
I'm talking about this car.

03:51.865 --> 03:54.778
By the way, I do the negotiating
at the dealership today.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.610
- Why?
- Honey, I'm a businessman.

03:56.670 --> 04:00.140
When it comes to people,
I know how to get what I want out of 'em.

04:00.207 --> 04:03.882
This watch- The man sold it to me
for half of what he was asking.

04:03.944 --> 04:06.891
These- a third.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.120
This- for free.

04:10.384 --> 04:13.695
So who's better at working people,
Mr. Businessman?

04:13.754 --> 04:15.893
Fine. We have different approaches,
but we're both pretty good.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.368
Hmm.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.495
Hello, Mitch.

04:20.560 --> 04:23.337
Hey, buddy. You look like
you want to get up and walk.

04:24.898 --> 04:28.812
Late bloomer. Fine. Who cares
if the other kids call you Slow Joe?

04:28.869 --> 04:30.542
And they do, you know.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.880
Bye-bye.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.420
We're gonna have to reschedule
the car shopping.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.478
Mitch has to work. Cam has to dance.

04:37.544 --> 04:39.717
- We have to sit Lily.
- Hmm.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.350
- What?
- Nothin'.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.759
Just- I could have got us out of that.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.391
Stop! Ugh!

04:46.453 --> 04:48.490
- Eat it! Eat the grass, cow!
- Get off me!

04:48.555 --> 04:50.466
- Hi, Rhonda.
- Hi, Mrs. Dunphy.

04:50.524 --> 04:53.027
- Hey, Mom.
- Honey, it's getting very close to time for the dance.

04:53.093 --> 04:55.130
- Shouldn't you go in and get changed?
- I did already.

04:55.195 --> 04:57.835
- The guys are coming by. We're gonna ride from here.
- What about you, Rhonda?

04:57.898 --> 04:59.809
- You want to go in and get cleaned up?
- I'm good.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.574
Are you?
What about that dirt on your face?

05:01.635 --> 05:05.344
Luke, you wait here. Ride with your friends.
I will bring Rhonda. Come on.

05:07.141 --> 05:11.385
Just, um, give me a good shake
like a dog before you go inside.

05:11.445 --> 05:14.449
I know.

05:14.515 --> 05:17.052
My dad has three tattoos.
Like, "Why? You're a dad."

05:17.117 --> 05:18.755
Ew! it's so sad when parents try.

05:18.819 --> 05:22.289
My mom double-pierced one of her ears,
and I'm like, "Hello! You're 50."

05:22.356 --> 05:24.700
So old- like, ancient-
to have an ear piercing-

05:24.758 --> 05:26.965
- it's nasty.
- Uh, you two decide to go to the dance?

05:27.027 --> 05:28.529
- Well, yeah, but not really.
- But yeah.

05:28.595 --> 05:30.199
- What?
- We're going ironically...

05:30.264 --> 05:32.801
to make fun of all the kids
who make a big deal out of it.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.675
"Ironic"? My ass.

05:34.735 --> 05:37.739
Alex likes Drew.
She's just playing it safe.

05:37.805 --> 05:41.014
Now there are the pushy, obnoxious moms
who try and get involved...

05:41.075 --> 05:43.351
nudge them towards one another.

05:43.410 --> 05:45.253
We mean well.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.830
- Fancy shirt, Coach Tucker.
- Oh, thank you.

05:52.886 --> 05:57.392
You know what I like to say.
I might be coach, but I travel first class.

05:57.458 --> 06:01.634
So, what would you think about giving
the opening remarks at the dance tonight?

06:01.695 --> 06:04.505
The arts committee has never made
this much, and it's all because of you.

06:04.565 --> 06:07.205
Oh, you guys. When I came
to this school six months ago...

06:07.267 --> 06:09.713
I never would have imagined
you would embrace me the way-

06:09.770 --> 06:11.841
Excuse me? Is this a chem lab?

06:11.905 --> 06:14.249
Because I'm looking for a big reaction.

06:14.308 --> 06:17.289
And there it is. Hi. How are- Oh!

06:17.344 --> 06:19.324
Who is this?

06:19.380 --> 06:21.121
How was sabbatical?

06:21.181 --> 06:22.558
Amazing.

06:22.616 --> 06:25.961
I'm rested and ready...
to take another vacation.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.760
How are we supposed to know him?

06:27.821 --> 06:31.291
Señor Kaplan. Legendary Spanish teacher.

06:31.358 --> 06:35.568
You know, my heart went out to him a little
because he left as everyone's favorite...

06:35.629 --> 06:39.839
and I'm sure word got out about,
you know- me.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.107
I just didn't want him
to feel displaced.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.308
Okay. Excuse me, big guy.

06:44.371 --> 06:46.180
Gifts for everyone.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.481
Angela, this is fresh from Anuradhapura.

06:48.542 --> 06:52.388
And, uh, Karen, you might want to eat
some chapati with that.

06:52.446 --> 06:54.517
- And this is for, um-
- Marcia.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.219
Marcia! Right, of course. I knew that.

06:56.283 --> 06:57.956
I must have been having
a "señor" moment.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.560
Somebody's always on.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.866
- Who did this?
- What happened?

07:03.924 --> 07:06.427
Somebody knocked my bag down
and broke my phone.

07:06.493 --> 07:08.234
Lily, do you know anything about this?

07:08.295 --> 07:10.002
He did it.

07:10.063 --> 07:13.374
- Joe?
- Yep. I'm going to go and play.

07:13.434 --> 07:16.244
- She lies.
- How could Joe pull a bag off a table?

07:16.303 --> 07:18.214
He can't even walk. I'll talk to her.

07:18.272 --> 07:22.652
Why you? Because you're such a businessman
that know how to talk to people?

07:22.709 --> 07:24.552
Trust me.
When I get done talkin' to her...

07:24.611 --> 07:28.058
not only will she have confessed to the crime,
I might even sell her a closet.

07:29.716 --> 07:33.960
I remember my buddies
and I were playing rock war once.

07:34.021 --> 07:36.797
That's a game where you chuck rocks
at each other's heads.

07:36.857 --> 07:39.838
I mean, what could go wrong, right?

07:39.893 --> 07:43.966
I put one through the window
of my old man's Rambler...

07:44.031 --> 07:46.534
and he thought my baby brother did it.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.945
I couldn't take it,
and I told him I did it.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.711
It felt so good to confess...

07:52.773 --> 07:55.276
and my old man was so proud of me...

07:55.342 --> 07:57.515
I didn't even get in any trouble.

07:57.578 --> 07:58.921
Y- You know?

08:00.347 --> 08:02.418
Joe did it.

08:05.252 --> 08:06.822
- She's good.
- Watch and learn.

08:06.887 --> 08:09.060
I don't think that cleavage thing
is gonna work with this one.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.295
That's not my only trick.

08:11.358 --> 08:13.770
- Hola, Lily.
- Where did Grandpa go?

08:13.827 --> 08:17.798
Don't worry about Jay.
It's only you and me here now.

08:17.865 --> 08:21.711
So, tell me,
which one of these is your favorite?

08:22.769 --> 08:27.650
Fine. One by one, they will disappear.

08:27.708 --> 08:32.623
Sooner or later,
we'll get to the one that you love.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.784
Ladies and gentlemen,
he's the emperor of escrow.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.260
He puts the "tude" in Tudor.

08:38.318 --> 08:43.323
Let's put your hands together
for Phil Dunphy!

08:45.626 --> 08:48.163
Thanks for the kind introduction, me.

08:48.228 --> 08:52.438
Now, unlike past years...

08:52.499 --> 08:56.174
I'm not gonna stand up here and talk your ears off.

08:56.236 --> 08:59.911
No, ladies and gentlemen.
You deserve more.

In law school,
Wendy Kirk couldbe a little intense.

10:06.607 --> 10:09.315
I always hoped that
she'd soften over time, but...

10:10.644 --> 10:12.214
some people go the other way.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.986
This place is a nightmare.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.583
The conditions are deplorable...

10:15.649 --> 10:19.256
and no one should have to suffer
this kind of abuse on a daily basis.

10:19.319 --> 10:23.358
What kind of tyrant
has such utter disregard for human life?

10:23.423 --> 10:26.370
- I can't do this.
- You have to. Wendy needs to hear it.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.099
- Yeah, but I'm nervous.
- Mitchell-

10:28.161 --> 10:30.835
- Yes! Hi.
- I just had a great idea.

10:30.897 --> 10:34.242
I think you would be
the perfect person to groom Rex.

10:34.301 --> 10:38.078
- Excuse me? - I just think he'd really
respond to someone like you, you know?

10:38.138 --> 10:41.347
- You don't mind, right?
- Uh, no. No, not at all.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.410
Great. Thanks.
Will you go over and introduce yourself?

10:43.477 --> 10:45.218
- Intro- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah. Thank you.

10:45.278 --> 10:46.780
- Yeah.
- Okay.

10:49.282 --> 10:54.163
Hello. I'm Mitchell.
And, apparently, this is my job now.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.292
Oh, God, you smell.

10:56.356 --> 10:59.394
♪♪People are looking at me.

10:59.459 --> 11:02.702
Yeah! That's because
you let me make you beautiful.

11:02.763 --> 11:05.209
Nuh-uh. Stop it. Am I?

11:05.265 --> 11:08.542
Yes, you are. Have fun. Go. Go.

11:09.670 --> 11:12.048
Drew. Hey, Drew. Having fun?

11:12.105 --> 11:13.914
"Fun"? Uh- Okay.

11:13.974 --> 11:16.079
Oh, Drew. Drew, listen.

11:16.143 --> 11:18.851
Phil and I are gonna be out
really late tonight...

11:18.912 --> 11:22.689
so there will not be an adult at the house
when you drop Alex off...

11:22.749 --> 11:24.251
if you know what I mean.

11:24.317 --> 11:26.923
Don't worry.
I'll drop her off and I won't go in.

11:26.987 --> 11:29.365
Well, big house...

11:29.423 --> 11:31.232
you know, cute daughter.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.532
I would not be opposed
to you walking her in...

11:33.593 --> 11:35.266
keeping her company until we get back.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.740
Like I said,
we will not be back until late.

11:37.798 --> 11:39.778
- I hear you, Mrs. Dunphy.
- Uh-huh.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.835
- You can trust me.
- Well, gonna have to trust you...

11:41.902 --> 11:44.314
because we have no way
of knowing what you're gonna get up to.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.408
In fact, if your car
is blocking the driveway...

11:46.473 --> 11:48.646
I'll just honk twice
and wait for you to come out.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.518
- Okay.
- Okay.

11:50.577 --> 11:52.818
Go get her, tiger. Come on.

11:54.614 --> 11:56.116
Nice job, Tucker.

11:56.183 --> 11:58.356
I mean, you made so many choices
that I never would have made...

11:58.418 --> 11:59.920
but a lot of them are working.

11:59.986 --> 12:01.966
Oh, well, you know,
I just watched the videos...

12:02.022 --> 12:04.024
of the many, many dances you planned...

12:04.091 --> 12:05.866
and just built off that one idea.

12:05.926 --> 12:09.169
- Hey, kids!
- There are my little chalupas!

12:09.229 --> 12:11.106
- ¡Hola!
- ¡Hola!

12:11.164 --> 12:13.166
Wow!

12:13.233 --> 12:14.837
Um, what did you do to Rhonda?

12:14.901 --> 12:17.108
- I cleaned her up.
- No, you broke her.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.650
- I hate her like this.
- She looks fantastic.

12:19.706 --> 12:22.482
To you! Fix her. Ugh, it confuses me.

12:22.542 --> 12:23.953
Oh, Luke.

12:24.010 --> 12:27.389
"The house will be empty"?
You are pimping me out!

12:27.447 --> 12:29.427
It is clear that the two of you
like one another.

12:29.483 --> 12:31.986
- Sometimes you need a little nudge.
- Well, you're a chaperone!

12:32.052 --> 12:34.293
Just disappear.
This dance is not for you!

12:37.824 --> 12:39.997
Uh-uh-uh.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.562
You're lucky that's water.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.732
Damn it.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.403
She's been stewing in there
for an hour.

12:49.469 --> 12:52.040
I say let's lock the door,
cut the power.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.381
Let's show her that we mean business.

12:54.441 --> 12:58.082
Let's try the joint approach first, Gitmo.

13:02.048 --> 13:04.358
- Hmm.
- Okay, we've been going over your story...

13:04.417 --> 13:05.919
and it doesn't add up.

13:05.986 --> 13:08.364
My purse was too high for Joe to reach.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.264
He's tall enough to reach up here.

13:10.323 --> 13:14.567
He knocked over the baby powder
trying to get my stuffed animals.

13:14.628 --> 13:18.303
- Not buying it.
- Look. You can see the footprints where he walked.

13:18.365 --> 13:20.902
- Walk?
- Lily, Lily, Lily.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.880
- Joe can't walk.
- He does for me.

13:23.937 --> 13:27.441
So you have ways of making him walk?

13:28.408 --> 13:30.615
Lily, just admit that you did it.

13:30.677 --> 13:34.284
Come here, Joe.
Come here, like you did before.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.418
- Honey, you're embarrassing yourself.
- Come here, Joe.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.656
He can't walk.

13:40.720 --> 13:44.167
He's walking!
The candles that I lit worked!

13:44.224 --> 13:47.569
Look at the stride on him.
He's as sure-footed as a mountain goat.

13:47.627 --> 13:51.871
- Told you.
- I'm so sorry that we doubted you.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.969
Boy, did I get lucky.

13:58.305 --> 14:02.082
I'm going to blame everything on him
until he learns how to talk.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.345
This guy waltzes in here
like he's king of the dance...

14:05.412 --> 14:07.756
after doing God knows what in Sri Lanka.

14:07.814 --> 14:10.727
"Building schools in underdeveloped areas."
What does that even mean?

14:10.784 --> 14:12.991
Is it possible that you're being
a little hard on the man?

14:13.053 --> 14:16.557
I turned his two-bit dance
into the event of the year.

14:16.623 --> 14:19.900
Look. Burnouts and dweebs
hanging out together in harmony.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.566
- That is me.
- I'm sorry, Cam.

14:22.629 --> 14:25.041
Don't feel sorry for me.
Next is faculty dance.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.135
Kaplan can't move. it's on his Tumblr.

14:27.200 --> 14:31.080
It's his big shame.
Trust me. He can't touch this.

14:31.137 --> 14:35.847
Okay.
Time now for the faculty dance. Go, teachers.

14:35.909 --> 14:37.411
Uh, are you sure?

14:37.477 --> 14:39.957
Stop. it's Cammer time.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.959
Ooh!

14:47.020 --> 14:49.227
♪ Shake it, shake it ♪

14:49.289 --> 14:50.859
Mind if I join you, Coach?

14:50.924 --> 14:54.235
♪ Shake your groove thing Shake
your groove thing Yeah, yeah ♪

14:54.294 --> 14:56.706
♪ Show 'em how we do it now♪

14:56.763 --> 15:01.143
♪ Shake your groove thing Shake
your groove thing Yeah, yeah ♪

15:01.201 --> 15:02.874
♪ Show 'em how we do it now♪

15:02.936 --> 15:07.180
While on sabbatical, I learned a thing or two
from Sri Lanka's own Chitrasena.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.810
I don't know who that is...

15:08.875 --> 15:12.220
and it's annoying when you say things
like people are supposed to know!

15:12.279 --> 15:17.456
That pathetic peacock of a man
was not going down without a fight.

15:17.517 --> 15:21.363
I had a choice to make-
be the better dancer or the bigger man.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.630
So I stepped off the dance floor
and made the obvious call.

15:24.691 --> 15:28.639
You want to win over a crowd?
Invite a lonely mom to dance.

15:28.695 --> 15:31.335
She never saw it coming,
and neither did he.

15:31.398 --> 15:34.242
- Whoo!
- ♪ Shake it♪

15:34.301 --> 15:36.781
♪ Show them how we do it now♪♪

15:41.408 --> 15:45.185
Hey, señor. You just got out-coached.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.548
I try and look on
the bright side of things.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.926
I'm a "doggybath is half full"
kind of guy.

15:51.985 --> 15:53.931
But it was time for me to open my eyes.

15:54.921 --> 15:56.867
I was working for a monster.

15:56.923 --> 15:59.529
I came to this job
to be the voice of the downtrodden.

15:59.592 --> 16:02.732
Turns out those downtrodden
were my coworkers...

16:02.796 --> 16:06.869
and they were desperate
for a hero to slay their dragon.

16:06.933 --> 16:09.072
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.910
Um, Rex, how's it going with Mitchell?

16:10.971 --> 16:12.644
The new guy? I haven't met him yet.

16:12.706 --> 16:14.583
That's weird.
I asked him to introduce himself.

16:14.641 --> 16:18.214
Um- Hey, has anybody
seen my dog? Pixie!

16:18.278 --> 16:19.780
Oh, there she is.

16:19.846 --> 16:22.190
Wow! Okay, Wendy, I'm sorry.

16:22.248 --> 16:25.661
I have something to say to you, something
that everybody else here is afraid to say.

16:25.719 --> 16:27.528
Now, I know you're fighting
the good fight...

16:27.587 --> 16:30.033
but that is no excuse
for the way you treat people.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.900
That actually might be one of the reasons
that you have no personal life...

16:32.959 --> 16:36.771
because who wants to come home
to a cold, emotionless thug?

16:36.830 --> 16:39.037
What are you talking about?

16:39.099 --> 16:41.375
I am an experienced,
respected attorney...

16:41.434 --> 16:44.108
and on my first day,
you asked me to bathe Rex.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.740
I'm not comfortable with that.

16:45.805 --> 16:48.376
And I'm not comfortable
with that, but I did it.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.216
Okay, that's Pixie.

16:50.276 --> 16:53.052
This is Rex, the intern
I asked you to groom.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.719
And that is my mistake, and I own that.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.455
But that is still no excuse...

16:57.517 --> 17:00.123
for the way that you tore into him
for the outfit he wore yesterday.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.063
I was talking about the outfit
he picked out for me.

17:02.122 --> 17:05.968
Apparently, I have the one gay intern
in the world with absolutely no fashion sense.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.699
I was unaware of- of this dynamic.

17:07.761 --> 17:09.569
But I-I'm not alone here, all right?

17:09.628 --> 17:12.872
There are people in this room
who feel that you are- How did we say it?

17:12.932 --> 17:16.277
You are "a tyrant
with no regard for human life."

17:16.336 --> 17:19.112
That sounds like my summation
for the slumlord case.

17:19.172 --> 17:21.049
- Oh, hey, you finished it?
- It's wonderful.

17:21.107 --> 17:24.088
- But he's nervous to show you.
- Why are you so hard on yourself?

17:24.144 --> 17:26.714
Okay, but what- what about you
making us work on Sundays?

17:26.780 --> 17:28.316
The night of my barbecue?

17:28.381 --> 17:31.988
Dan? What are you still doing here?
It's your anniversary! Go home!

17:32.052 --> 17:33.861
Oh, God.
This isn't happening. No, no.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.423
She's- She's crazy.
I mean, I saw her attack the vending machine.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.662
That's the only way it works
since Dennis broke it.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.363
Dennis is the guy whose office I took?

17:40.427 --> 17:43.465
Yeah, he was the machine's best customer
until he started running.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.373
One day, he said he's got to get out or-

17:45.432 --> 17:47.139
He would die. Okay. Okay.

17:47.200 --> 17:51.012
Wendy, um, I might owe you
a little bit of an apology, so I'm sorry.

17:51.071 --> 17:54.450
Uh, clearly, everybody here loves you,
and I was wrong about everything.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.248
- So, I'm sorry.
- No, you-

17:56.309 --> 17:58.915
You weren't wrong about everything.
I mean-

17:58.978 --> 18:01.788
Look, I do joke about it,
but you're right. I'm alone.

18:01.848 --> 18:05.091
And that is not the first time
that someone has called me cold.

18:05.151 --> 18:07.961
Those eggs-
Those eggs came out of me frozen.

18:08.021 --> 18:11.559
And I'm impossibly tall,
and even if I could find somebody to love me...

18:11.624 --> 18:13.763
- they wouldn't be able to reach.
- No. Hey, hey. Come on.

18:13.827 --> 18:16.433
You're an amazing woman.
She's an amazing woman.

18:16.496 --> 18:19.340
And you're a role model. You're a hero.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.208
- I'm a six-foot hero.
- No.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.645
Come on. You're surrounded
by people who love you.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.741
Here's Dan and Rex. Me. Come here.

18:26.806 --> 18:30.481
All the way up
to Samuel L. Jackson there.

18:30.543 --> 18:33.387
- That's your mother in a Kangol hat, isn't it?
- Yeah.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.119
Um, are you sure you know
what you're doing, Tad?

18:35.181 --> 18:36.854
I know you're the mortgage doctor-

18:36.916 --> 18:40.056
Someone said, "ls there a doctor in the house?"
Was I supposed to not get up?

18:40.120 --> 18:42.225
Hey, Dad. You need any help
out of that dress?

18:42.288 --> 18:45.030
Not unless you want to see me
in nothing but a Baby New Year's diaper.

18:45.091 --> 18:47.435
That was the big finish
to the song you were texting through.

18:47.494 --> 18:50.031
- Hey, I got one text. I saw most of the show-
- We're leaving, okay?

18:50.096 --> 18:53.339
- Could you just go to the table and
grab my keys and purse? - Fine.

18:53.399 --> 18:55.003
You want to talk about it?

18:55.068 --> 18:56.775
How many kinds of fake doctor are you?

18:56.836 --> 19:00.181
Okay, time for the big award of the night,
the ROY, Realtor of the Year.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.878
I don't even know why I'm mad at her.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.943
Probably just 'cause
she was so bored all night.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.785
Maybe you're feeling rejected?

19:05.845 --> 19:07.347
It's my own fault.

19:07.413 --> 19:09.791
I built up this hope that she'd
want to follow me into real estate.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.624
...Phil Dunphy.

19:11.684 --> 19:14.722
She's got her own life now.
I just don't know where we connect anymore.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.232
- You won.
- What?

19:16.289 --> 19:18.599
- Yeah.
- Help me up!

19:18.658 --> 19:20.501
Oh!

19:20.560 --> 19:22.562
As we all know,
Phil had a little accident tonight...

19:22.629 --> 19:25.269
- but we're happy to accept this award on his behalf.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

19:25.331 --> 19:26.810
I got this.

19:26.866 --> 19:30.575
Hi. I'm, uh- I'm Haley, Phil's daughter.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.617
Dad, you won the ROY!

19:32.672 --> 19:33.878
Oh.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.749
Um-
Wow.

19:35.808 --> 19:38.220
You all know him
as an amazing Realtor...

19:38.278 --> 19:40.986
but I know him
as the world's greatest dad.

19:41.047 --> 19:46.759
As far as I'm concerned,
he's Dad of the Year, the DOY.

19:46.819 --> 19:49.595
It really is a shame that you didn't
hear the rest of his act tonight.

19:49.656 --> 19:52.068
I-I heard him rehearsing it.

19:53.493 --> 19:56.997
Uh, which one of you is J.J. McCubbin?

19:57.063 --> 20:00.374
Oh. Hey, quick question, J.J.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.970
Why is a great mortgage rate
like your wife in bed?

20:03.036 --> 20:04.947
Once a month and low interest.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.314
What are you laughing at, Skip Woosnum?

20:08.374 --> 20:11.651
You haven't seen a commission
since you joined the navy.

20:11.711 --> 20:15.090
- She is killing it.
- That's my girl. I would have hit the word "navy" harder.

20:15.148 --> 20:17.560
What else? What else?

20:17.617 --> 20:19.619
Oh! Margaret Fuhrman's here.

20:19.686 --> 20:23.964
Little heads-up to her date- she's been
upside down in more houses than Fannie Mae.

20:25.592 --> 20:28.368
Or, in her case, Fannie definitely will.

20:28.428 --> 20:31.204
We all want people
to think the best of us.

20:31.264 --> 20:34.768
So sometimes we cover things
up to protect ourselves.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.243
But we don't have to be afraid

20:40.607 --> 20:43.884
Because the truth
is always a good thing

20:45.511 --> 20:47.013
The truth sets us free.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.222
Brings us closer.

20:52.285 --> 20:55.892
So, do you want to tell us how Joe's shoes
ended up on the wrong feet?

20:55.955 --> 20:59.459
I guess the little guy knows
how to put on his own shoes.

21:04.130 --> 21:07.043
- There you go, buddy. You got this.
- What are you doing?

21:07.100 --> 21:09.671
Since Joe can walk now,
I figured he should be doing a few chores.

21:09.736 --> 21:12.046
- Steady, big guy!
- Chores? What kind of-

21:12.105 --> 21:14.346
There he is. That-a-boy!

21:14.407 --> 21:16.148
That-a-boy!

21:16.209 --> 21:18.485
A beer? Are you crazy?

21:18.544 --> 21:20.751
Where you going? You want some?
He'll bring it to you.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.724
I can't believe
that you're teaching him to do that.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.659
Wait till you see part two.

21:24.717 --> 21:26.560
Attaboy.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.860
Relax! it was me.
