"Previously on" The Shield:

00:03.120 --> 00:05.680
- I said, I'm a cop!
- And I'm a cop killer.

00:05.880 --> 00:07.520
- Do you trust me?
- Yeah.

00:07.680 --> 00:09.920
Well, then you believe
me when I tell you...

00:10.080 --> 00:12.560
...you don't have to look over
your shoulder no more.

00:12.720 --> 00:14.720
I took care of it.

00:14.880 --> 00:18.600
- I'm concerned about Matthew.
- Well, he's a little shy, but...

00:18.760 --> 00:21.760
What I'm trying to say is,
I think there's a problem.

00:21.960 --> 00:23.360
What kind of problem?

00:23.480 --> 00:26.400
Something a developmental
paediatrician should diagnose.

00:26.520 --> 00:27.600
A neurologist, maybe.

00:28.640 --> 00:31.400
- I'm not gay.
- I wasn't gay either...

00:31.560 --> 00:34.600
...until the day I just
admitted that I was.

00:34.760 --> 00:37.720
It's okay. It's okay.

00:39.680 --> 00:41.000
Say it.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.800
We killed a cop.

00:44.400 --> 00:47.680
Lem and Ronnie failed
to clear the room.

00:47.840 --> 00:53.680
Two-Time killed Terry. Get over it.
Don't bring it up again.

01:54.960 --> 01:57.040
Is there anything
you're not allergic to?

01:59.480 --> 02:01.000
Sheet metal.

02:11.320 --> 02:12.680
This coke's really pink?

02:12.840 --> 02:15.760
No, not really. It just looks pink
in the right kind of light.

02:15.920 --> 02:18.640
- Cool.
- Yeah. It's Peruvian.

02:18.800 --> 02:22.480
Rondell said the street ain't seen blow
this strong since Grandmaster Flash.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.280
What's that?

02:25.160 --> 02:26.160
Never mind.

02:28.360 --> 02:31.840
How much time are they giving these
days for installing an illegal wiretap?

02:32.040 --> 02:34.160
Not as long as some of
this fruit's been here.

02:34.280 --> 02:36.520
These Third World cavemen
ever hear of a Ralphs?

02:38.200 --> 02:42.000
- Shane. Shane, Shane, Shane.
- Here we go.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.120
- Yo.
- Yeah. Bakers are home, boys...

02:52.280 --> 02:55.600
...and they're coming through
the front door. Exit the ass.

03:06.440 --> 03:08.360
This is gonna be a sweet
win for us, boys.

03:08.520 --> 03:11.120
Aceveda gets a gold star,
we get a little breathing room.

03:11.280 --> 03:14.160
- Rondell gets product.
- The retirement fund keeps growing.

03:14.320 --> 03:17.240
- Who's saving for retirement?
- Can you say "ski-doo"?

03:17.400 --> 03:19.840
All right.
Hey, we're wired.

03:27.560 --> 03:30.760
The Armenians speak Armenian.

03:32.960 --> 03:35.520
- Theo Chorlian?
- Yeah?

03:35.680 --> 03:37.960
Professor Gaffney says
you'd be the perfect guy...

03:38.080 --> 03:40.080
...to help us with
a special investigation.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.760
- What kind of special...?
- You'll love it. Come with us.

03:42.880 --> 03:46.160
He'll meet you back
at the dorm. All right?

03:46.760 --> 03:49.800
These guys are
Eastern Armenian.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.480
- So?
- So they got accents.

03:53.720 --> 03:55.680
You understand what
they're saying or not?

03:56.640 --> 04:01.040
The gardener delivers six loaves
of Agien white bread?

04:01.200 --> 04:03.800
- Does that make sense?
- When and where?

04:04.840 --> 04:08.440
Will arrive here
tomorrow night, 9:30.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.400
- At the bakery.
- Bakery? What kind of bread this is?

04:11.600 --> 04:13.440
- Thanks, kid.
- What's this all about?

04:13.600 --> 04:16.000
- Who are these guys?
- National security.

04:16.279 --> 04:18.959
Don't tell a goddamn soul.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.640
You've been a big help.
Thanks.

04:25.760 --> 04:27.200
Okay, Bingham,
here's the story.

04:27.360 --> 04:30.040
You were driving these gothic
goons back from LAX...

04:30.160 --> 04:33.160
...when you overheard them talking
about the shipment of cocaine.

04:33.360 --> 04:36.840
I won't bore you with the details.
Being such a concerned citizen...

04:37.320 --> 04:40.680
...you felt compelled to share
this information with the authorities.

04:41.760 --> 04:44.600
All we need now is for you
to sign your statement.

04:45.600 --> 04:46.600
Here you go.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.520
Anything to take
a bite out of crime.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.560
Judge Weiss is waiting.

04:54.680 --> 04:59.160
Well, thank you for helping us
get our nice legal warrant.

04:59.760 --> 05:02.520
- Feels good to do the right thing.
- Yes, it does.

05:26.360 --> 05:29.160
- Showtime?
- There's seats still available.

05:29.320 --> 05:31.520
I saw the warrant,
heard you were rolling out.

05:31.680 --> 05:34.200
I'm backing you up
with a few uniform patrols.

05:35.280 --> 05:37.520
That's not how we do it.

05:38.040 --> 05:41.760
Well, that's how I do it. I wanna make
sure everyone comes home this time.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.440
The more the merrier.

05:45.400 --> 05:46.760
Good.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.520
- Somebody here to see me?
- Over there.

06:05.440 --> 06:09.080
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I'm here to report a hit and run.

06:09.560 --> 06:10.800
- What?
- I was struck by...

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
...a beautiful black man
driving a big red...

06:13.120 --> 06:15.720
- Not here. You have got to go.
- Look, you haven't called.

06:15.840 --> 06:18.600
- I just wanna make sure you're okay.
- I'm fine, now go.

06:18.760 --> 06:21.080
Why are you
shutting me out then?

06:22.920 --> 06:24.840
I'll call you later.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.120
I don't wanna just hear your voice.
I wanna see you.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.640
I'll stop by if you leave right now.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.080
Okay.

06:36.120 --> 06:40.120
But if you don't show,
I'm gonna be back here tomorrow...

06:40.280 --> 06:43.600
...and the day after,
and the day after that.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.560
- Danny.
- Hey, Dutch.

06:47.720 --> 06:50.760
Here are those notes and study
guides for the sergeant's exam.

06:50.920 --> 06:51.960
Great.

06:52.120 --> 06:55.240
The test is at 7 a.m. In San Pedro.
What's up with that?

06:55.400 --> 06:57.200
Lack of sleep thins the herd.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.400
I barely know my name before 8.

07:00.520 --> 07:04.520
Got lesson plans, practice tests.
I organized it all.

07:04.960 --> 07:07.120
Should make it easier
for us to review it.

07:07.280 --> 07:10.280
- Thanks. This is a big help.
- When do you wanna go over that?

07:11.000 --> 07:13.320
- Tomorrow night good?
- Good for me.

07:13.480 --> 07:18.440
- 9:00, my place?
- Your place, perfect. No distractions.

07:21.240 --> 07:24.560
A study date? What kind of
backdoor con is that?

07:24.720 --> 07:27.520
I'm helping her study
for the sergeant's exam.

07:27.680 --> 07:30.360
Unless the first question is,
"Will you sleep with me?"...

07:30.480 --> 07:32.800
...you're wasting your time.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.200
Okay. Hang back.
Once we're inside...

08:01.360 --> 08:04.880
...cover the exits.
I'll call you out.

08:35.480 --> 08:37.760
Police, freeze!
Put that gun down!

08:37.960 --> 08:39.679
Get it down!
Put the gun down!

08:39.840 --> 08:42.080
Put your hands in the air!
Put them on your head!

08:42.280 --> 08:44.960
On your head!
Put your hands on your head!

08:46.280 --> 08:47.960
All right, we're clear.
We're clear.

08:49.560 --> 08:52.360
- He's done. Cuff him.
- Ronnie.

08:52.520 --> 08:54.800
- All right, call them up.
- "We're secure.

08:54.960 --> 08:57.280
"One dead Armenian,"
"three "to take home.

08:57.440 --> 09:00.560
- Copy that. Code Four. Code Four.
- We're Code Four.

09:00.720 --> 09:02.320
King, call for a body wagon.

09:02.480 --> 09:03.720
- Cover that door.
- I'm there.

09:03.880 --> 09:04.880
- Cover the back.
- Okay.

09:05.040 --> 09:08.880
No one in or out not wearing a badge.
Mike, come with me.

09:13.600 --> 09:16.120
- That don't look pink.
- It's not the right kind of light.

09:16.320 --> 09:17.600
Get this stuff downstairs.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.200
- Load them up.
- Thank you, sir.

09:24.400 --> 09:26.800
Easy with that. Don't spill it
all over the place.

09:34.440 --> 09:37.400
Hey. Jesus Christ here was
the shooter. Keep him separate.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.480
Gotcha.
Come on.

09:39.640 --> 09:41.800
Okay, Ronnie,
you got the ball.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.920
You know how much fat
is in that cookie?

09:45.080 --> 09:47.480
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

09:49.480 --> 09:50.480
No, I'm serious.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.720
Those are sugarcoated lard balls.

09:52.880 --> 09:56.240
- Have you looked at your waist lately?
- Come on, Shane.

09:56.560 --> 09:58.160
Get to it.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.080
- Bag it.
- Bag it.

10:02.240 --> 10:04.240
- Bag it.
- Bag it.

10:04.720 --> 10:06.360
And...

10:08.120 --> 10:09.640
...bag it.

10:14.360 --> 10:18.440
Don't want my kids to end up
in U.C. Northridge hell.

10:18.800 --> 10:21.840
- Hey, I went to Northridge.
- Majored in "Where's the Keg At"?

10:22.640 --> 10:25.760
- That's funny.
- Deliver this package to Rondell.

10:26.360 --> 10:27.680
Right.

10:41.480 --> 10:43.800
Hey, nice job, guys.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.280
Way to go, guys.

10:48.480 --> 10:51.000
Four bricks of Peruvian pink, people.

11:33.440 --> 11:34.680
Hey, angel.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.800
- What?
- You're five hours late.

11:38.960 --> 11:41.680
- It's work.
- Yeah, well, I have to go to work too...

11:41.800 --> 11:44.200
...in about five hours.
- Hey.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.440
What? We just took down
some bad guys.

11:46.600 --> 11:49.000
- I'm feeling it.
- Well, it doesn't mean I have to.

11:49.160 --> 11:51.840
- Just give me 15 minutes.
- A marathon.

11:52.040 --> 11:55.600
- 15 minutes. 15 minutes.
- All right.

11:56.960 --> 12:01.640
- Four keys. Nice bust.
- Yes. Very nice.

12:06.040 --> 12:09.400
- Don't see any money in the log.
- That's because there wasn't any.

12:09.560 --> 12:12.560
- Major drug deal and no cash?
- Nope.

12:12.720 --> 12:16.120
Just a million in powder,
a killer and two drug collars.

12:16.280 --> 12:18.760
Sorry. Slow night.

12:19.520 --> 12:23.000
I guess if that's what you put
in the book, then that's what you found.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.360
Look, it was a delivery, not a buy.

12:30.400 --> 12:33.880
Why is it that no matter what I do,
you always assume the worst?

12:34.040 --> 12:35.760
Have you given me a choice?

12:35.920 --> 12:38.000
Believe it or not,
we want the same things:

12:38.160 --> 12:41.600
Taxpayers safe,
bad guys behind bars.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.880
I just wanna make sure
we're going about it the same way.

12:49.280 --> 12:53.400
I know you blame me for Terry's death.
It was my command.

12:53.560 --> 12:56.320
- I deserve that.
- Yeah, you do.

12:56.760 --> 12:59.000
But what happened that night...

13:00.200 --> 13:03.600
...if I could change it, I would.

13:03.760 --> 13:05.360
I can't.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.600
Neither can you.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.800
You gotta be shitting me.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.000
You're a cop.
Why couldn't you call it in?

13:42.120 --> 13:44.520
- It's complicated. Police issues.
- What's that mean?

13:44.680 --> 13:47.800
You have no idea how bad
I need for you to be quiet right now.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.240
- We've been down this block 3 times.
- Unless you see a black Navigator...

13:51.400 --> 13:53.800
...there should be nothing
coming out of your mouth.

13:54.720 --> 13:56.080
- Black Navigator...
- Not funny!

13:56.280 --> 13:58.120
- No, a black Navigator.
- It's not funny!

13:58.280 --> 13:59.600
Hey.

13:59.760 --> 14:04.160
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey, pull over!

14:04.320 --> 14:08.800
Pull... I'm a cop!
I'm a police officer!

14:09.000 --> 14:10.520
Pull...
I swear to God.

14:11.160 --> 14:14.080
- Pull over! Hey! Pull over! Pull over!
- Shane.

14:14.280 --> 14:16.760
- Pull over right now! Goddamn it!
- Oh, my God.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.560
- Pull your car over!
- Shane.

14:18.720 --> 14:21.760
Pull over! Right there!
Pull over! Yeah!

14:21.960 --> 14:24.320
Stay there. Right there.
You, come here!

14:24.480 --> 14:26.280
You understand English?
Come here.

14:26.440 --> 14:29.240
- Right now.
- Take the truck, man! Just take it!

14:29.400 --> 14:31.400
- Don't shoot us, dude.
- Shut up. I'm a cop.

14:31.560 --> 14:33.520
What'd we do?

14:33.680 --> 14:36.160
You stole a police vehicle,
you little shitheads.

14:36.680 --> 14:38.520
It's my mom's car.

14:52.520 --> 14:55.360
Tampons.
No.

15:00.640 --> 15:03.680
What? What?

15:05.760 --> 15:07.800
- Let me do that.
- I got it.

15:07.960 --> 15:11.600
- You make it too strong.
- Okay.

15:11.840 --> 15:12.840
You're up early.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.440
Thought I heard Matthew
having a nightmare last night.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.200
- Did you hear Cassidy coughing?
- No.

15:17.360 --> 15:19.760
I think she's getting
what the baby had.

15:19.880 --> 15:22.240
- The doctor's at 3:30.
- I know.

15:26.680 --> 15:29.080
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:29.240 --> 15:31.040
- Good morning, Corrine.
- Morning.

15:31.200 --> 15:36.160
- What are you doing here?
- I kind of lost the truck last night.

15:37.360 --> 15:40.160
You know,
the one with the stuff inside.

15:40.280 --> 15:41.920
What?

15:42.720 --> 15:44.200
I'm gonna go check on Cassidy.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.200
- You lost the Navigator?
- Somebody stole it.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.000
- With the drugs inside.
- Yeah.

15:50.160 --> 15:53.480
- Where were you?
- At Amy's.

15:53.640 --> 15:56.400
You stopped to get laid?
What the hell were you thinking?

15:56.560 --> 15:58.800
I was thinking about getting laid.

15:58.960 --> 16:02.240
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry doesn't cut it.

16:03.160 --> 16:04.600
I was wrong.

16:09.080 --> 16:12.040
- So, what do you wanna do now?
- We got about four more hours...

16:12.240 --> 16:15.080
...before that truck is
on the way to Mexico City...

16:15.280 --> 16:18.320
...in about 10,000 pieces,
and our score's out on the street.

16:19.240 --> 16:21.360
Call Lem and Ronnie,
get them to the clubhouse.

16:21.520 --> 16:23.680
Nobody steals from us.

16:25.160 --> 16:26.560
That quick, it had to be a pro.

16:26.720 --> 16:29.200
- It's being chopped as we speak.
- So they have the drugs.

16:29.400 --> 16:32.240
- And I'm out 50 K.
- We're all out 50 K.

16:32.400 --> 16:36.560
- Maybe they're just letting it cool off.
- You hold onto that little dream.

16:37.480 --> 16:39.360
Go to Rondell.
Tell him what happened.

16:39.520 --> 16:42.240
- Tell him what happened?
- He'll hear about it anyway.

16:42.440 --> 16:43.840
- All right.
- You, come with me.

16:47.520 --> 16:49.440
I can't wait to tell Rondell.

16:54.600 --> 16:57.000
Vic, my man.

16:57.840 --> 17:00.600
- Officer Hoffman.
- Vic.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.720
- Hollywood.
- What's up, Hoff.

17:02.880 --> 17:05.400
- What you got yourself?
- Green Jeep.

17:05.560 --> 17:09.119
Had a couple nibbles, no bites.
What can I do you for?

17:10.040 --> 17:12.040
- Who's chopping the big trucks?
- What kind?

17:12.200 --> 17:13.240
- Navigator.
- Year?

17:13.400 --> 17:16.720
- Brand new.
- 2002 Lincoln Navigator.

17:16.880 --> 17:20.200
A few places offhand. Currently the
demand is greater than the supply.

17:20.319 --> 17:24.000
- Where's demand the greatest?
- Hold on, hold on.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.480
Slow day.

17:30.640 --> 17:34.320
Look, main shop is in your part of town
where they chops those monsters.

17:34.520 --> 17:40.160
Skinny Polish prick. Mark Wojo...
Wojohowitz or something like that.

17:40.320 --> 17:43.320
- Don't tell him I sent you.
- Thanks, man. I owe you.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.360
If you need another guy
on your team, man...

17:45.560 --> 17:49.880
...maybe you'll toss my name
in the hat. I could use the action.

17:50.320 --> 17:53.880
Who knows? Might be a new spot
opening up any day now.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.680
Well, all right.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.520
So many rocks, so little time.

17:58.680 --> 18:00.640
Nothing like the bust
last night, though, huh?

18:00.760 --> 18:02.000
That was a big one.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.920
- What was the final score on that one?
- Four bricks.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.520
Four?

18:07.680 --> 18:10.400
Mackey sure knows how
to pull them out of his ass.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.400
You might as well talk to us.

18:12.560 --> 18:15.600
We've got four cops who saw you
blow your buddy's brains out.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.040
You know what that means?

18:17.200 --> 18:19.200
One of them could
get hit by a bus and we'd...

18:19.400 --> 18:23.080
Still have three cops who could
put you away for first-degree murder.

18:23.280 --> 18:25.960
You listening to me?
Add that to the trafficking...

18:26.160 --> 18:29.680
Charge and, well, your prospects
aren't looking too pretty.

18:31.280 --> 18:33.200
"Tell me where you"
"got the drugs."

18:33.360 --> 18:36.480
"Tell me about your buddy Margos,"
"and his drug connections."

18:36.640 --> 18:38.920
"- You listening to me?"
"- I say something funny?"

18:39.080 --> 18:43.400
"What if I stuffed big blue bananas"
"in your" ears and set them on fire?"

18:44.200 --> 18:46.040
"Any of this getting through?"

18:46.200 --> 18:49.960
This guy ignores me almost as much
as my kids did in high school.

18:50.120 --> 18:53.680
- Nothing?
- No one's talking.

18:53.840 --> 18:57.040
- They're all terrified of him.
- Anything on the prints?

18:57.200 --> 19:01.040
Only Dizarian's came up on Interpol.
Lokely's got a Glendale address.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.560
He's been questioned,
but not charged in...

19:03.680 --> 19:06.320
...Kosovo, Bogotá, Sri Lanka.
- Frequent flier.

19:06.480 --> 19:11.040
He just came back from a 36-hour
holiday from Chiclayo, Peru.

19:11.200 --> 19:12.200
Harvest-time.

19:12.600 --> 19:15.200
- Get a warrant to search his place.
- Yeah.

19:15.720 --> 19:17.840
"Revenge? Crime of passion?"

19:18.040 --> 19:21.240
He insult your mother?
Having a bad hair day?

19:21.400 --> 19:23.640
Let me know if I'm getting warm.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.240
- Yeah.
- This Universal Studios?

19:31.440 --> 19:35.760
- What? No.
- What, you mean this ain't City Walk?

19:35.920 --> 19:38.000
- Are you guys for real?
- Looky here.

19:38.160 --> 19:41.080
Looks like a vehicle being
stripped for illegal distribution.

19:41.240 --> 19:43.000
I'll be damned.
In plain sight too.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.600
- It's a good thing we're policemen.
- No way.

19:45.760 --> 19:48.800
Think that Universal thing's
gonna hold up in court?

19:48.960 --> 19:52.120
Well, maybe, maybe not.
In the meantime, it looks like...

19:52.280 --> 19:54.520
...we'll have to return these
to their owners...

19:54.680 --> 19:56.840
...and bring you in,
Polish prick Mark.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.720
- All right, what do you guys want?
- Blue Navigator.

20:00.880 --> 20:04.040
- Don't have one.
- You get any offers last night?

20:04.520 --> 20:06.200
Answer the question.

20:06.360 --> 20:09.240
- I get to keep these?
- If you make me happy.

20:09.800 --> 20:12.600
A guy Ricardo called.
Wanted to unload a Navigator.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.840
- Ricardo have an address?
- Yeah. He's in Silver Lake.

20:18.040 --> 20:20.280
Where in Silver Lake, asshole?

20:35.040 --> 20:38.840
Must like you, officer. It's the first
thing this faggot's said all day.

20:48.560 --> 20:49.800
- Hey, Dutch.
- Hey.

20:49.960 --> 20:51.680
You interviewed that Armenian, right?

20:51.840 --> 20:54.480
"Interview" would imply that
a conversation took place.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.840
- This guy didn't say a word.
- He did to me.

20:57.320 --> 20:58.760
- When?
- Just now.

20:58.920 --> 21:00.960
- What'd he say?
- I guess it was Armenian.

21:01.120 --> 21:04.320
It sounded something
like "hamal v otcar."

21:06.480 --> 21:11.280
<i>- Hamal v otcar.
- Hamal v otcar.</i>

21:11.440 --> 21:14.200
- You okay?
- Yeah. That guy just creeps me out.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.880
Don't let him.
He's behind bars.

21:16.040 --> 21:17.520
- I'll check on this.
- Thanks.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.840
What the hell?

21:26.520 --> 21:27.880
- Who are you guys?
- Shut up.

21:28.040 --> 21:29.520
I'm trying to sleep here.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.120
Where's the Navigator
you tried to unload last night?

21:32.320 --> 21:34.240
How'd you get in my bedroom?

21:39.240 --> 21:41.080
Look, I didn't jack it.
It was Dina.

21:41.240 --> 21:43.920
- Who's Dina?
- Girl I'm trying to break into the game.

21:44.120 --> 21:46.200
He's trying to bone.

21:46.720 --> 21:50.320
- Where can we find Dina?
- Who are you guys?

21:52.000 --> 21:55.280
Hey, call Lem and Ronnie and
have them bring you over to Dina's.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.560
- Where are you going?
- I got somewhere to go.

21:58.240 --> 21:59.600
- Where?
- You're not exactly...

21:59.800 --> 22:02.160
...in a position to question
my decisions.

22:02.280 --> 22:05.040
Just call me when you
have Dina or the drugs.

22:08.040 --> 22:10.760
- Officer Sofer.
- Detective Mackey.

22:10.920 --> 22:13.640
- What you got there?
- Notes.

22:13.840 --> 22:16.400
Sergeant's exam.
Dutch is gonna help me out.

22:16.560 --> 22:19.480
Dutchman isn't pulling the old
I'Il-help-you-study...

22:19.640 --> 22:22.000
...you-help-me-get-laid
manoeuvre, is he?

22:22.160 --> 22:26.200
- He'd like to help me pass.
- He'd like to help you out of your pants.

22:30.640 --> 22:33.120
Last night, Shane ran in
for a Slurpee and managed...

22:33.280 --> 22:35.320
...to get our police-issue
vehicle jacked.

22:35.520 --> 22:38.640
- Ouch.
- Yeah. Had our weapons in it too.

22:38.800 --> 22:41.720
That stuff hits the street and gets
traced back to us...

22:41.840 --> 22:45.360
...Aceveda will put Shane's balls
in a vice. And mine too, probably.

22:45.520 --> 22:49.440
- What's the vehicle?
- 2002 blue Navigator, fully loaded.

22:49.640 --> 22:52.200
I'd like to bring it in
personally, quietly.

22:52.360 --> 22:54.880
Keep my eye open
and give you the heads up.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.600
Thanks.

22:57.600 --> 23:00.560
So is that what Shane's calling it
these days, a Slurpee?

23:01.000 --> 23:02.320
I guess so.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.480
Detective Wyms, I was hoping
I could talk to you.

23:10.640 --> 23:12.400
- About?
- Advice.

23:12.560 --> 23:15.080
Well, shouldn't you be going
to your P-3 for advice?

23:15.240 --> 23:17.440
I'd rather talk to you.

23:17.680 --> 23:20.000
- Why? Because I'm black?
- No.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.760
Better not be because
I remind you of your mother.

23:23.520 --> 23:25.000
No, ma'am.

23:25.960 --> 23:27.440
I mean, detective.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.200
Never mind. I'm sorry
to have bothered you.

23:33.360 --> 23:35.160
Officer.

23:38.640 --> 23:40.160
What is it?

23:40.920 --> 23:44.320
I think I may have seen another cop
do something illegal on the job.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.760
- And?
- And I don't know what to do about it.

23:51.160 --> 23:57.160
You're talking about jeopardizing
two careers here: His and yours.

23:58.240 --> 23:59.240
Mine?

23:59.760 --> 24:02.800
Nobody likes a rat, especially one
who hasn't proven himself.

24:03.200 --> 24:06.600
- So I should keep this to myself.
- No, I didn't say that.

24:06.760 --> 24:11.080
You gotta ask yourself if it's something
bad enough to risk that kind of heat.

24:11.240 --> 24:14.200
Is it something you can't
live with holding?

24:16.400 --> 24:19.080
You're certain there
were six bricks?

24:19.240 --> 24:22.720
Six or seven.
Definitely more than four.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
- You did the right thing.
- Yeah.

24:29.040 --> 24:31.920
- I know it wasn't easy.
- No, sir.

24:32.080 --> 24:35.880
We'd be a lot better off with more
men like you and fewer like Mackey.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.920
So, what happens now?

24:41.520 --> 24:44.560
Can you check on when
the blue Navigator was checked in?

24:44.720 --> 24:46.240
Don't have to. Wasn't.

24:46.440 --> 24:49.800
Supposed to be in five hours ago.
Wilshire's been asking for it back.

24:53.080 --> 24:57.680
- He's supposed to be the best.
- They say that about every doctor.

25:01.160 --> 25:03.280
- Yeah.
- "Is Shane with you?"

25:03.440 --> 25:04.880
No. Why?

25:05.040 --> 25:07.760
<i>Just got a complaint from a woman
"who said a police officer..."</i>

25:07.960 --> 25:11.080
...fitting Shane's description,
assaulted her son at gunpoint...

25:11.240 --> 25:12.840
...claiming he stole
a police vehicle.

25:13.040 --> 25:15.040
You sure she's not
some crackpot?

25:15.200 --> 25:17.600
"Where's that blue Navigator"
"you signed out last night?"

25:17.760 --> 25:20.000
Don't know.
I'll ask Shane when I see him.

25:20.160 --> 25:23.280
- "I need that truck back now".
- Loud and clear. Gotta run.

25:24.040 --> 25:25.240
- Sorry.
- Quite all right.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.360
Why don't you both have a seat.

25:30.120 --> 25:33.000
So, Mr. And Mrs. Mackey,
how are you both doing today?

25:33.160 --> 25:35.400
You tell us.
How'd the testing go?

25:35.560 --> 25:38.200
The past three sessions have
gone well. You're very lucky.

25:38.360 --> 25:41.520
Matthew is a charming,
intelligent little boy.

25:42.360 --> 25:44.440
He also has autism.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.880
- What?
- Autism.

25:49.480 --> 25:52.240
- Oh, God.
- Wait a minute.

25:52.960 --> 25:56.880
He's a little shy, behind a bit...

25:57.040 --> 26:00.240
...but autism? Jesus.

26:01.520 --> 26:02.720
What does that mean?

26:02.880 --> 26:05.880
It's a hard word to hear, but it's also
a very misunderstood word.

26:06.040 --> 26:09.360
- Matthew's a beautiful child. He's...
- I know my son is beautiful.

26:09.880 --> 26:12.680
- I understand what you're feeling.
- Really.

26:12.840 --> 26:14.600
I have two autistic boys of my own.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.520
- Two?
- Oh, man.

26:16.680 --> 26:19.640
Yes. I felt everything
you're feeling twice.

26:19.800 --> 26:21.240
What's gonna happen to him?

26:21.400 --> 26:24.000
- He's going to grow up.
- What about school?

26:24.160 --> 26:26.080
He may be best served
in a special program.

26:26.240 --> 26:30.320
Special? What do you mean, like
blue-bus special? That's not my kid.

26:30.480 --> 26:35.320
I mean, look at him.
He's just Matt.

26:35.840 --> 26:37.120
I knew something was wrong.

26:37.280 --> 26:40.480
He could stay in his present
school with some speech therapy...

26:40.640 --> 26:44.760
...and special-skills instruction.
- Is he gonna be normal or not?

26:45.200 --> 26:48.720
With the proper support, he will be able
to make gains to the best of his ability.

26:48.880 --> 26:51.480
And with intervention,
the prognosis is very good.

26:51.640 --> 26:54.240
He's just gonna need a lot of love
and work to get there.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.640
He's got the love.
What kind of work?

26:57.240 --> 27:00.440
Jesus. I'm sorry. I'm a cop.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.600
- What?
"- We are so screwed, man."

27:03.760 --> 27:07.440
"Aceveda just put a statewide
"APB out on the Navigator."

27:15.520 --> 27:16.760
What's up?

27:16.920 --> 27:20.280
Roommate said this Dina girl went to
go get waxed. She didn't know where.

27:20.440 --> 27:22.960
- You got anything more vague?
- What should we do?

27:23.120 --> 27:26.640
Aceveda gets ahold of this truck, he's
gonna do a chem match on the blow...

27:26.760 --> 27:28.680
...our fingerprints
are all over the bricks.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.880
We'll all crash and burn
because of you!

27:31.000 --> 27:32.480
Christ, Amy's not even that hot.

27:32.600 --> 27:33.720
- Come on, Lem.
- No, bull!

27:33.880 --> 27:35.160
He's right.
You boned us.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.160
Oh, thank you for the support, assholes!

27:37.320 --> 27:39.000
Cut it out!

27:39.680 --> 27:40.680
We're not going down.

27:41.320 --> 27:43.440
- You understand me?
- Yeah, yeah.

27:43.600 --> 27:46.560
All right. Ronnie, you stay here
and wait for Dina.

27:46.720 --> 27:49.640
Lem, they got a bunch of those
wax places over on Olvera Street.

27:49.800 --> 27:53.280
We'll check the muff rippers
over in Little Tokyo. Let's go.

27:59.280 --> 28:01.800
Well, if the DA is not gonna file...

28:06.280 --> 28:08.040
- You check out Margos' place?
- Yeah.

28:08.200 --> 28:11.480
You think this guy was spooky before,
you should see the way he lives.

28:11.640 --> 28:13.680
- What'd you find?
- Nothing incriminating.

28:13.800 --> 28:17.680
Just a couple hundred maps,
six dictionaries in five languages.

28:17.880 --> 28:21.640
- Scanner, digital camera, GameBoy.
- Incense, meditation books.

28:21.840 --> 28:25.160
- Disposable diapers.
- A whole case of microwave popcorn.

28:25.440 --> 28:27.400
- Hey, no microwave.
- No microwave.

28:27.560 --> 28:30.560
- No fridge, no stove.
- No plates, silverware.

28:30.760 --> 28:32.040
- No soap.
- No toilet paper.

28:32.240 --> 28:33.720
No more.

28:33.880 --> 28:36.160
This guy just gets better and better.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.040
- Break almost over?
- Yeah.

28:40.200 --> 28:42.240
Did you get a chance
to look at those notes?

28:42.400 --> 28:43.520
A little.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.080
A lot of stuff to absorb.
Don't put it off too long.

28:46.240 --> 28:47.720
I won't.

28:47.880 --> 28:50.560
Hey, Dutch, any luck
with that translation?

28:52.200 --> 28:54.960
You know, it's a phonetic spelling.

28:55.120 --> 28:57.680
Armenians have this
Eastern-Western dialect thing.

28:57.840 --> 29:01.120
- What did your guy say that it meant?
- This is by no means definitive.

29:01.240 --> 29:04.040
But what Margos may have
been saying was...

29:05.840 --> 29:08.400
...delicious feet.
- Excuse me?

29:08.760 --> 29:12.640
- Delicious feet, yeah.
- Oh, God.

29:12.840 --> 29:14.640
You probably just
heard him wrong.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.400
Hey, hey.

29:31.880 --> 29:33.040
Let's go.

29:35.440 --> 29:36.960
Don't move.

29:39.040 --> 29:40.240
Jesus.

29:41.840 --> 29:43.520
He snapped his neck.

29:44.760 --> 29:48.960
Let me guess. You're not talking.
Get them out of here.

29:49.280 --> 29:52.120
And call Central, have them
get this guy out of my building.

29:52.320 --> 29:55.520
Step outside the car by opening
the door from the outside.

29:55.680 --> 29:57.120
Okay.

29:59.360 --> 30:01.920
- Sorry.
- Step outside.

30:06.120 --> 30:07.720
- I'm so sorry.
- Turn around.

30:07.840 --> 30:09.720
- Put your hands on the window.
- Look, l...

30:09.920 --> 30:13.000
I know it's not your problem, okay...

30:13.160 --> 30:16.000
...but I'm sorry.
My dad's drinking again...

30:16.160 --> 30:19.320
...and I had to grab my brother
and bolt out of there this morning.

30:19.440 --> 30:23.360
It was so crazy.
God, I was so scared.

30:23.640 --> 30:27.040
Well, sorry. Listen, is there anything
we can do for you?

30:27.200 --> 30:30.800
Yeah. I just need to pick up my brother
at school before my dad gets there.

30:30.960 --> 30:33.000
I mean, God knows
what he'll do to him.

30:33.120 --> 30:34.480
If you could just let me go...

30:34.600 --> 30:38.840
Always pick up your abused brother
in a stolen vehicle with bogus plates?

30:41.000 --> 30:42.280
Damn.

30:42.480 --> 30:45.200
- One Tango 13, copy?
- Hey, hold up on that.

30:45.360 --> 30:46.880
Stand by.
What?

30:47.040 --> 30:49.880
Told Vic I'd give him the heads up
when we found the Navigator.

30:50.040 --> 30:51.440
- What for?
- I don't know.

30:51.600 --> 30:55.080
- He wants to be the one to bring it in.
- It's an APB. We have to call it in.

30:55.280 --> 30:58.040
Look, I owe Vic one. Hey!

30:58.600 --> 30:59.720
Where are you going?

30:59.880 --> 31:02.920
You two look like you
needed some alone time.

31:03.080 --> 31:04.800
Get in the car.

31:06.440 --> 31:09.760
One Tango 13, we have a confirmation
on that stolen Navigator.

31:09.960 --> 31:13.160
"Roger, Tango 13."
"I'll notify the watch commander."

31:13.600 --> 31:17.160
I can't risk a bad mark on my jacket
this early in my career.

31:30.400 --> 31:31.400
Anything touched?

31:31.560 --> 31:33.800
No, sir, we secured the scene
and made the call.

31:33.920 --> 31:35.240
Okay.

31:40.640 --> 31:42.520
Lock box.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.520
Nothing.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.360
Goddamn it.

32:02.560 --> 32:04.480
He called it in before
I could stop him.

32:04.640 --> 32:06.520
- Are you kidding me?
- What's his problem?

32:06.640 --> 32:08.280
Look, he's just learning.

32:08.440 --> 32:11.000
Look, the good news is
they didn't find those weapons.

32:11.160 --> 32:14.600
- Did he find anything?
- Just Dina.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.800
Looks like I located
your missing truck.

32:17.960 --> 32:19.920
Was hoping I'd save you the trouble.

32:20.760 --> 32:23.680
- All's well that ends well.
- Yeah.

32:31.320 --> 32:34.080
- You're in deep, Dina.
- Yeah?

32:34.240 --> 32:37.720
Shoplifting, assault.
Now grand-theft auto.

32:37.880 --> 32:40.360
- What's next?
- Thinking about the police academy.

32:40.800 --> 32:44.040
Why don't you go
get me an application.

32:44.200 --> 32:48.440
You think this is a game, little girl?
This is real time in real prison.

32:48.600 --> 32:52.080
Okay. Are you going somewhere
with this scared-straight angle?

32:52.240 --> 32:55.840
Or is this where I tell you how my
daddy used to crawl into bed with me?

32:59.560 --> 33:02.560
I wanna know what
you found in the Navigator.

33:03.640 --> 33:05.880
I heard someone call you "captain."

33:06.040 --> 33:09.160
I mean, isn't a stolen car case
normally a little below your radar?

33:09.880 --> 33:11.080
You wouldn't be here...

33:11.200 --> 33:13.960
...if I didn't have what you wanted.
- Where are the drugs?

33:15.960 --> 33:17.040
They're safe.

33:17.200 --> 33:20.320
Tell me where, and I'll make sure
the auto theft goes away.

33:21.840 --> 33:27.600
Until I see it, I don't say it.
In writing, signed by the DA.

33:43.480 --> 33:47.400
- Hey. That the car thief stuff?
- Yeah.

33:47.560 --> 33:50.240
Hey, I hear you're
looking for another stripe.

33:51.280 --> 33:54.320
- Yeah. See you.
- All right. Good luck.

33:54.480 --> 33:55.680
Thanks.

33:56.240 --> 33:59.080
She made three phone calls
after she stole the truck.

33:59.200 --> 34:02.640
Two to her roommates and the other
to a pawnshop in Echo Park.

34:03.880 --> 34:07.840
"- Pemble & Pemble on Esther."
- Head for Esther in Echo Park.

34:08.000 --> 34:12.000
- Man, do I owe you one.
- Please. At best, I'm even.

34:13.920 --> 34:16.800
Stop staring at my feet,
you Balkan freak.

34:16.960 --> 34:20.120
- "What"?
- Nothing.

34:20.280 --> 34:22.239
Danny.
Come with us.

34:25.800 --> 34:28.520
I think Aceveda got Dina to talk.
I gotta go.

34:28.760 --> 34:30.320
- Damn it.
- What?

34:33.760 --> 34:35.600
Hey, man, we're not closed yet.

34:36.800 --> 34:40.040
Yo, "sprechen sie Englisch", skinhead?
I said, we're not closed yet.

34:48.960 --> 34:52.560
In 30 seconds I'll either know
what I wanna know or you'll be dead.

34:52.719 --> 34:54.440
- Dina.
- I don't know a Dina.

34:54.600 --> 34:56.960
- How come you have our guns here?
- Talk!

34:57.120 --> 34:59.000
- Dina called for Freddy.
- Who's Freddy?

34:59.120 --> 35:01.760
French guy.
Helps me out with the night traffic.

35:01.920 --> 35:04.640
- Where are the drugs?
- I don't know. Maybe Freddy took them.

35:04.800 --> 35:05.960
Not good enough!

35:08.120 --> 35:10.040
I swear to God, man, I don't know!

35:10.200 --> 35:13.280
Why would I cover for him?
Jesus Christ, he's French.

35:13.440 --> 35:16.240
Where can we find the frog?

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Looks like Freddy
couldn't hold his sugar.

35:39.160 --> 35:41.040
Power of the pink.

35:41.200 --> 35:44.200
- Blew a goddamn vessel.
- Oh, that's nasty.

35:44.360 --> 35:48.120
All right, go through this place. Make
sure there's nothing here to tie us.

35:50.640 --> 35:53.200
Vic! It's Aceveda.

35:53.520 --> 35:56.000
Hey, let's clean up Freddy! Here we go.

35:56.160 --> 36:00.520
- Oh, shit. Clean him up.
- Wipe it all down.

36:00.680 --> 36:03.720
Tray. Here's the tray.
Here's the tray. Coming through.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.880
Yeah, yeah. Is that it?

36:09.960 --> 36:12.520
All right, all right.
Run this. Good, good.

36:13.160 --> 36:14.800
- You got it?
- Clean fingers.

36:14.920 --> 36:20.600
- What's going on here?
- It must've been a hell of a party.

36:25.760 --> 36:28.880
- What happened to him?
- Looks like an OD. Found him that way.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.640
- Been dead a while. Really dead.
- Yeah. We were about to call it in.

36:32.800 --> 36:36.680
You were about to call it in.
What are you doing here?

36:36.840 --> 36:40.920
Fair question. Tracking down the guns
from our stolen ride.

36:41.080 --> 36:45.040
- Yep. All's here and accounted for, sir.
- Can't have them hitting the streets.

36:48.960 --> 36:52.920
- Didn't want them in the wrong hands.
- Where's Mackey?

36:54.120 --> 36:58.360
Hey. Thought he wouldn't mind
if I used the can.

36:58.960 --> 37:01.080
What are you doing there, captain?

37:01.240 --> 37:03.720
I'm looking for something.

37:10.840 --> 37:13.760
- Where is it?
- Don't know what you're talking about.

37:13.920 --> 37:17.320
Hey, treat yourself to a full
cavity search if you like.

37:28.560 --> 37:30.560
I'll see you back at the barn.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.120
Turn it inside out.

37:44.280 --> 37:46.560
Every inch.

37:50.840 --> 37:54.120
- I thought you were working.
- Yeah. I gotta go back.

37:54.280 --> 37:55.960
Just snuck out
to tuck in little man.

37:56.120 --> 37:57.960
Better hurry.
He might already be asleep.

37:58.080 --> 37:59.280
Okay.

38:00.240 --> 38:03.440
- How you doing?
- I'm all right. I'm just a little tired.

38:03.600 --> 38:08.680
Yeah. I know.
Don't worry, we'll get through this.

38:31.840 --> 38:34.560
What did you get for 38?

38:37.920 --> 38:39.280
I answered C.

38:39.440 --> 38:40.760
No, it's B.

38:40.920 --> 38:44.000
Have to report the infraction
immediately to the commanding officer.

38:44.160 --> 38:46.800
- There's no latitude on that.
- Stupid rule.

38:49.400 --> 38:51.880
Would you turn in your partner
on something like that?

38:52.040 --> 38:55.120
I know how I'd answer on the test.

38:55.280 --> 38:57.680
Hello? Hi.

38:57.840 --> 38:58.960
No, are you okay?

39:00.040 --> 39:03.800
No, come on over. Okay.

39:03.960 --> 39:06.720
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

39:06.880 --> 39:10.000
A friend of mine is having a crisis
and she wants to come over.

39:10.160 --> 39:13.120
- She okay?
- I don't know.

39:14.600 --> 39:18.320
- We got a lot of work done tonight.
- Yeah.

39:19.960 --> 39:22.320
Hey, you're a good teacher.

39:23.240 --> 39:25.360
- See you tomorrow?
- Yeah.

39:25.520 --> 39:28.080
We'll dive into administrative
and procedural.

39:28.240 --> 39:32.000
It's dry stuff, but you can't pass
without nailing it.

39:35.920 --> 39:38.760
- Good night.
- Night. I hope your friend's okay.

39:39.320 --> 39:41.280
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

39:41.440 --> 39:42.800
Okay.

39:43.200 --> 39:45.240
Thanks.

39:46.120 --> 39:50.960
Sorry about today, it was such a faggot
thing to do. Showing up at your work.

39:51.120 --> 39:52.640
Don't do it again.

39:53.880 --> 39:55.120
I won't.

39:56.360 --> 39:57.440
You gonna sit?

40:00.960 --> 40:03.800
I really am sorry.

40:05.320 --> 40:06.440
I'll make it up to you.

40:06.600 --> 40:10.800
I can't be the person that you want me
to be. I shouldn't even be here.

40:13.720 --> 40:16.560
- You've never come back, have you?
- This is stupid.

40:16.720 --> 40:22.400
What's stupid are the late-night cruises
and anonymous hummers in your car.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.200
What?

40:27.640 --> 40:29.800
I read a page of your diary?

40:29.960 --> 40:35.000
You don't know anything about me.
Things that I believe, things that I see.

40:35.160 --> 40:37.520
- You're a good person.
- I'm doing a bad thing.

40:37.640 --> 40:39.360
You deserve to be happy.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.200
You ever read the Bible?

40:41.360 --> 40:43.920
Scripture teaches...

40:47.360 --> 40:49.280
Never mind.

40:49.440 --> 40:52.080
You came back.

40:53.240 --> 40:55.600
Start listening to yourself.

41:20.680 --> 41:24.080
- You're here late.
- I'm e-mailing my girls.

41:24.240 --> 41:26.040
Just got a call from Central.

41:26.200 --> 41:29.760
Margos Dizarian
escaped from the paddy wagon.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.920
What? How?

41:32.080 --> 41:36.560
Jimmied open the back door, dove out
at 40 miles an hour in his cuffs.

41:37.400 --> 41:40.640
- Disappeared down an alley.
- Jesus.

41:41.360 --> 41:44.160
- I know.
- That's a special kind of crazy.

41:44.720 --> 41:47.920
Very special.
Just thought you should know.

41:48.080 --> 41:52.880
I wish I didn't.
God knows where he is right now.

42:00.400 --> 42:02.080
You okay?

42:02.240 --> 42:05.080
Not really.

42:05.240 --> 42:08.560
I'm just kind of all over the place.

42:08.720 --> 42:13.000
- Job?
- Yeah. And I...

42:14.200 --> 42:16.440
Brutal day.

42:16.800 --> 42:18.920
"Come on".

42:27.280 --> 42:29.600
Where are you?

42:30.040 --> 42:32.440
I don't know.

42:34.840 --> 42:38.440
I got something going on with my kid.

42:40.320 --> 42:42.880
You don't wanna hear it.

42:44.080 --> 42:47.000
Let's talk about something else.

42:48.160 --> 42:49.160
Yeah.

43:06.760 --> 43:10.240
Oh, you've gotta be shitting me.
