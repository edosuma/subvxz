WEBVTT

00:09.357 --> 00:11.228
- My mom was picked up
by ICE last night.

00:11.968 --> 00:13.491
- Hey.

00:13.535 --> 00:15.145
- I'd like you
to start digging

00:15.189 --> 00:16.712
into some longer-term
projects for me.

00:16.755 --> 00:18.322
- Ickaris's second
headquarters.

00:18.366 --> 00:20.150
You sure you want
that headache?

00:20.194 --> 00:21.717
- If that headache comes with
half a billion in construction,

00:21.760 --> 00:23.066
I'll take it.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.285
- Who the hell is Albert Chan?

00:24.328 --> 00:25.503
- He's a
30-year-old billionaire

00:25.547 --> 00:27.114
who's buying up
half of Chicago.

00:27.157 --> 00:29.420
It's time to move on.
- I couldn't agree more.

00:29.464 --> 00:32.075
- If I don't push back
on that greedy son of a bitch,

00:32.119 --> 00:33.598
my guys won't support me.

00:33.642 --> 00:35.209
- The developer
got an emergency permit,

00:35.252 --> 00:37.124
and there's no way to stop it.

00:37.167 --> 00:38.560
You know you can stay with me
until you get on your feet.

00:38.603 --> 00:40.170
- Hi.
- Jeff gave me his key.

00:40.214 --> 00:41.519
- Oh, he did, did he?

00:41.563 --> 00:42.825
- What we need
is someone who wants

00:42.868 --> 00:44.479
to stick it to McGann
as much as I do.

00:44.522 --> 00:46.350
- The mayor is looking
for a new primary donor.

00:46.394 --> 00:47.786
- You want to make
him obsolete?

00:47.830 --> 00:49.223
This is your chance.
- Who's Tommy Diehl?

00:49.266 --> 00:51.181
- He was a Teamster boss
back in the day.

00:51.225 --> 00:52.748
- What happened to him?
- Disappeared.

00:52.791 --> 00:54.532
Body was never found.

00:54.576 --> 00:56.317
There are rumors McGann
had something to do with it.

00:56.360 --> 00:57.883
- Who do you think you are,
going to Thomas Lauder

00:57.927 --> 00:59.363
for finance?
- Business, Pat.

00:59.407 --> 01:00.669
- I own you.
- You don't own shit.

01:00.712 --> 01:02.584
- Pat McGann
dropped this off for you.

01:12.594 --> 01:16.554
- It's Nick.
Um, I need to talk to you.

01:16.598 --> 01:19.688
Something happened.
Um, pick up if you're--

01:19.731 --> 01:22.343
- What's going on, Nicky?
- It didn't go as planned.

01:22.386 --> 01:24.736
- All right, God damn it,
stop mumbling.

01:24.780 --> 01:26.390
- He's dead.

01:29.437 --> 01:32.918
Did you hear what I said?
- Jesus Christ.

01:35.573 --> 01:38.272
I took care of it.

01:41.840 --> 01:44.756
- He's got you on tape, Nick.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.802
- You knew I called him
that night--I told you then.

01:46.845 --> 01:48.630
- Yeah, I didn't know
he fucking taped it.

01:48.673 --> 01:50.371
- What difference does it make?

01:50.414 --> 01:51.937
He's been holding this
over our heads for years.

01:51.981 --> 01:53.635
- The difference is
now I know he's got proof.

01:53.678 --> 01:54.940
- I'm the one on that.

01:54.984 --> 01:56.855
I'm the only
one who's ever going to pay.

01:56.899 --> 01:58.640
- You don't think
that takes me down?

01:58.683 --> 02:00.250
I can't be connected to that.

02:00.294 --> 02:03.166
He'll never use it.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.646
- Yeah, he'll use it
if he gets desperate enough,

02:04.689 --> 02:06.300
and believe me,
he's getting pretty desperate.

02:06.343 --> 02:07.649
- Maybe you should've
thought of that

02:07.692 --> 02:09.303
before you backed him
into a corner.

02:09.346 --> 02:10.826
- What, you mean Jessica?
- Look, all you had to do

02:10.869 --> 02:12.654
was let him keep backing you,
and none of this

02:12.697 --> 02:14.699
would have happened!
- He's got you on tape, Nick!

02:24.970 --> 02:26.842
- No one would shed a tear

02:26.885 --> 02:28.974
if he fell off
one of his buildings.

02:29.018 --> 02:30.454
- You listen to me.

02:30.498 --> 02:32.500
I don't want you
going anywhere near him.

02:32.543 --> 02:33.979
I'll deal with Pat.

02:34.023 --> 02:35.720
Hey.

02:37.853 --> 02:39.855
You understand?

02:46.035 --> 02:47.689
- All right, one more,
and then we got to go.

02:47.732 --> 02:49.952
"Explicit."
- Good morning.

02:49.995 --> 02:53.260
- E-X-P-L-I-C-I-T.
Explicit.

02:53.303 --> 02:55.436
- Whoo!
- Yes!

02:55.479 --> 02:56.959
Nice.

02:57.002 --> 02:59.309
Is there a spelling bee
coming up I should know about?

02:59.353 --> 03:00.919
- Next week.
- Well, Mama won

03:00.963 --> 03:02.356
the spelling bee
when she was a kid.

03:02.399 --> 03:04.314
- Did she?
- Citywide, under 12.

03:04.358 --> 03:05.359
No biggie.

03:06.795 --> 03:08.362
- All right, boys,
get yourselves together.

03:08.405 --> 03:10.015
We got a train to catch.
Thank you.

03:10.059 --> 03:14.237
- I had no idea you guys were
up this early every morning.

03:14.281 --> 03:16.500
- Yeah, the hazard of being
on Lake Shore.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.502
The extra stops add time, so...

03:18.546 --> 03:20.025
- I can have my driver
take you.

03:20.069 --> 03:22.724
- Uh, no, you've done enough.

03:22.767 --> 03:24.900
And, besides, a driver?
Really?

03:24.943 --> 03:28.425
- Well, just for this morning,
if you want.

03:28.469 --> 03:30.949
- All right,
just this once, okay?

03:30.993 --> 03:33.343
I don't want them thinking
they're Richie Rich.

03:33.387 --> 03:35.563
- Oh, wait,
there is one more thing.

03:36.912 --> 03:39.001
I know you have
a lot on your plate,

03:39.044 --> 03:42.004
but if you don't move
out of your apartment,

03:42.047 --> 03:43.658
it's not going to be there
much longer

03:43.701 --> 03:46.704
- Uh, yeah, I know,
I have a double shift today.

03:46.748 --> 03:49.054
- Okay, well, if you want,
I can--I can try to find

03:49.098 --> 03:51.622
a moving company,
or I can go there myself--

03:51.666 --> 03:53.450
- No, no, it's fine.
I know where everything is,

03:53.494 --> 03:55.060
and the boys wanted
their 360.

03:55.104 --> 03:57.411
- Their what?
- Exactly.

03:57.454 --> 03:59.761
You wouldn't know
the first place to look.

04:10.075 --> 04:14.428
- His Honor!
See what's going on out here?

04:14.471 --> 04:17.300
We've come a long way,
you and me.

04:17.344 --> 04:19.955
- You son of a bitch.

04:19.998 --> 04:23.611
You know, I've always known
what you are, but that guy?

04:23.654 --> 04:25.787
To see his face,
to know you trapped him.

04:25.830 --> 04:27.702
- Hey, I didn't plan it.
It just happened.

04:27.745 --> 04:30.618
- Yeah, lucky for you, right?
- Hey, you pushed me, Bobby.

04:30.661 --> 04:32.402
You got no one
but yourself to blame.

04:32.446 --> 04:34.099
You're the one who tried to run
away from home.

04:34.143 --> 04:36.058
- Yeah, that's not
going to change.

04:36.101 --> 04:38.626
- What was that?
- You heard me.

04:38.669 --> 04:40.454
Tape or no tape,
you don't have the cash

04:40.497 --> 04:43.108
to keep me in City Hall--
the Lauders do.

04:43.152 --> 04:45.110
- You sure you want
to play it this way?

04:45.154 --> 04:47.765
- Listen to me, you prick.

04:47.809 --> 04:51.378
They put up the money,
you still have the influence.

04:51.421 --> 04:53.902
That's what you want, right?

04:53.945 --> 04:56.078
Where I come from,
that's called a win-win.

04:58.950 --> 05:01.823
You hear what I said?
- Yeah, I heard you.

05:01.866 --> 05:04.608
Just trying to figure out
whether I believe you or not.

05:04.652 --> 05:05.827
Seeing Steph last night

05:05.870 --> 05:07.872
reminded me what
a good liar you are.

05:07.916 --> 05:09.657
- Oh, I'm not asking
for permission.

05:09.700 --> 05:12.355
I got your message.
Now you have mine.

05:12.399 --> 05:13.835
Back off.

05:16.054 --> 05:18.143
- Hey, boss!

05:18.187 --> 05:20.058
That Albert Chan guy
called again.

05:20.102 --> 05:22.452
- Tell him to come down
to the site.

05:22.496 --> 05:24.541
I think he's going to like
what he sees.

05:28.676 --> 05:30.721
Take it down.

05:53.309 --> 05:54.528
- Hey.
- You ready yet?

05:54.571 --> 05:56.225
- Just about.

05:56.268 --> 05:59.184
Thank you for taking care
of my family today.

05:59.228 --> 06:02.971
It was above and beyond.

06:05.103 --> 06:07.584
Oh, the silent treatment.

06:11.371 --> 06:15.200
I'm sorry I asked you
to run a personal errand.

06:15.244 --> 06:19.553
It was, um...
out of bounds.

06:19.596 --> 06:21.729
- What's out of bounds
is you sticking your nose

06:21.772 --> 06:23.426
into Bobby's money.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.254
- Since when do you care
about campaign financing?

06:25.297 --> 06:26.690
- Yeah, you know what
I'm talking about.

06:26.734 --> 06:29.389
- The mayor brought me in
to fix his problems,

06:29.432 --> 06:31.434
and that's what I was doing.
- Yeah, fix them.

06:31.478 --> 06:33.654
Not create a goddamn rift when
there wasn't one to begin with.

06:33.697 --> 06:35.656
- You know, I don't know what
mayor you're driving around,

06:35.699 --> 06:37.658
but the one I see
is struggling to breathe

06:37.701 --> 06:39.442
under Pat McGann's fat thumb.

06:39.486 --> 06:41.575
- Yeah, it's called debt.
Welcome to Chicago politics.

06:41.618 --> 06:43.446
- Oh, judging by your reaction,

06:43.490 --> 06:47.145
I'd say the debt is about
a lot more than just money.

06:47.189 --> 06:49.670
What happened, Nick?

06:49.713 --> 06:52.324
Now that Bobby's
trying to get his freedom back,

06:52.368 --> 06:54.457
McGann showed his hand,
didn't he?

06:56.633 --> 06:59.157
How bad is it?
- Are you going to work or not?

07:12.780 --> 07:15.347
- "Lift our cities
to greater heights."

07:15.391 --> 07:17.480
- There's nothing wrong with
a little soaring rhetoric.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.308
- It's a Mayors' Conference.

07:19.351 --> 07:21.310
It not the keynote address
at the Democratic Convention.

07:21.353 --> 07:23.486
- Oh, these days,
cell phones, iPads.

07:23.530 --> 07:26.533
Everything's a keynote address.

07:28.186 --> 07:30.232
- That better not be
your "bad news" knock.

07:30.275 --> 07:32.234
- It's my "I've been
in a room negotiating

07:32.277 --> 07:33.801
for 24 hours" knock.

07:33.844 --> 07:36.194
- I told you they wouldn't
budge on the tax break.

07:36.238 --> 07:38.501
- Actually, we've come
to an agreement

07:38.545 --> 07:41.199
on all major issues.

07:41.243 --> 07:43.071
- What, you reached a deal?

07:43.114 --> 07:45.247
- It looks like you're
the winner

07:45.290 --> 07:47.510
of the Ickaris sweepstakes,
Mayor Novak.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.473
- You are the best.

07:53.516 --> 07:56.432
- If you want, I could leak
something to the press.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.477
- No, to hell with that.
Bring them in.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.087
I'll tell them myself.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.741
Are they okay with us
making an announcement?

08:00.784 --> 08:02.830
- Wait, wait, if you go public
and this thing blows up--

08:02.873 --> 08:04.527
- I'm talking to Keri, Derrick.

08:04.571 --> 08:06.529
You never wanted this thing
in the first place.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.400
- They're probably okay with
it, but you are giving them

08:08.444 --> 08:09.663
leverage
on some of the details.

08:09.706 --> 08:11.360
- She's right.
What if they have

08:11.403 --> 08:12.709
their own contractors
from out of Seattle?

08:12.753 --> 08:14.406
What if they want
to get out of MBE?

08:14.450 --> 08:16.278
- You're getting way
ahead of things.

08:16.321 --> 08:18.149
- I have to be ahead of things
because you're about to go

08:18.193 --> 08:19.760
face the nation out there
and you're not even prepped.

08:19.803 --> 08:21.196
Why not wait a day?

08:21.239 --> 08:22.502
- I have
the Mayors' Conference.

08:22.545 --> 08:24.591
- So wait a week.
- I'm not waiting!

08:24.634 --> 08:25.809
Make it happen.

08:36.167 --> 08:37.821
- Since the proposed site
is at Lincoln Yards,

08:37.865 --> 08:39.867
doesn't this continue to focus
job growth on the North Side

08:39.910 --> 08:41.564
instead of the South
and West Side,

08:41.608 --> 08:43.261
where unemployment
is the highest?

08:43.305 --> 08:44.741
- I reject the idea
that neighborhoods

08:44.785 --> 08:45.873
are pitted against each other.

08:45.916 --> 08:47.570
If one succeeds,
the other fails?

08:47.614 --> 08:49.311
Neighborhood growth
isn't just about business.

08:49.354 --> 08:51.226
It's about people.
- Sir, some of your critics

08:51.269 --> 08:52.401
are saying
this is another example

08:52.444 --> 08:53.576
of backroom deal-making.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.186
- It's how deals
get done, Malik.

08:55.230 --> 08:56.710
I think the 4,000 people
about to get a job

08:56.753 --> 08:58.320
are pretty happy about that.

08:58.363 --> 08:59.887
Is there a question?
- The question is,

08:59.930 --> 09:02.803
what promises were made
to lure Ickaris to Chicago,

09:02.846 --> 09:04.587
when will the details
be made public,

09:04.631 --> 09:05.893
and have similar
promises been made

09:05.936 --> 09:07.721
to contractors
bidding for the work?

09:07.764 --> 09:10.637
- When the deal is signed,
I'll read it to you myself.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.421
And I guarantee you,
we'll go through

09:12.464 --> 09:13.770
all normal
bidding procedures.

09:13.814 --> 09:15.598
- "Guarantee."
Really?

09:15.642 --> 09:20.298
- Yes, "guarantee."
How's that for a politician?

09:20.342 --> 09:21.430
Excuse me.

09:24.302 --> 09:26.566
That okay with you, boss?

09:26.609 --> 09:27.915
- I'm going to
hold you to that.

09:27.958 --> 09:30.308
- I'm sure you will.
- Nice press conference.

09:30.352 --> 09:31.919
I guess my invitation
got lost in the mail?

09:31.962 --> 09:33.616
- Give us a minute.
- I got work to do.

09:33.660 --> 09:34.617
- Is this your way
of punishing me?

09:34.661 --> 09:36.271
- For what?

09:36.314 --> 09:38.186
I thought you weren't
interested in Ickaris.

09:38.229 --> 09:39.709
After all, you pawned it off
on your assistant.

09:39.753 --> 09:41.450
- McGann's not
interested either,

09:41.493 --> 09:42.799
but it seems that he
was the only one

09:42.843 --> 09:44.366
you were speaking to out there.

09:44.409 --> 09:46.934
- Is that a fact?
- You and I both know

09:46.977 --> 09:49.284
why I wanted you
to cut ties with him,

09:49.327 --> 09:51.329
or at least you do now.

09:51.373 --> 09:52.635
I want to flush him out,

09:52.679 --> 09:54.419
find out exactly
what he has on you.

09:54.463 --> 09:56.334
And based on
my conversation with Nick,

09:56.378 --> 09:58.467
it's a lot worse
than you thought.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.470
- You didn't
flush anything out.

10:01.513 --> 10:03.559
- If I didn't,
you wouldn't have scheduled

10:03.603 --> 10:05.474
that little performance
to show McGann

10:05.517 --> 10:08.303
that you're still
the man in charge.

10:16.398 --> 10:17.834
Why are you doing this,
Ms. Pearson?

10:17.878 --> 10:19.531
- Doing what?
- This, all of it.

10:19.575 --> 10:21.359
You're a wealthy woman.

10:21.403 --> 10:23.405
You've got nothing
but money and time.

10:23.448 --> 10:25.363
You didn't need
to take this job to help.

10:25.407 --> 10:27.452
You miss the games,
the backstabbing,

10:27.496 --> 10:28.671
everything that goes with it.

10:28.715 --> 10:30.847
You like the power.

10:30.891 --> 10:32.501
Admit it.

10:32.544 --> 10:34.242
- I'll admit that
when you tell me

10:34.285 --> 10:35.809
what's got you and Nick
so rattled.

10:35.852 --> 10:38.681
- That's a deflection.
- That's not an answer.

10:38.725 --> 10:41.728
Tell me, Mr. Mayor...

10:41.771 --> 10:45.427
if Pat McGann
killed Tommy Diehl...

10:45.470 --> 10:46.994
what does that
have to do with you?

10:49.605 --> 10:51.520
- I already gave
one press conference today.

11:00.747 --> 11:03.706
How's that for progress, huh?

11:03.750 --> 11:05.708
Yeah, we should be breaking
ground within a week.

11:05.752 --> 11:08.015
- Congratulations.
You should be very happy.

11:08.058 --> 11:09.843
- No, that's we, my friend.

11:09.886 --> 11:12.672
Yeah, my guys are busting
their asses around the clock

11:12.715 --> 11:15.326
to give this shithole
the proper shine it deserves.

11:15.370 --> 11:17.502
- I can see,
but you're going to

11:17.546 --> 11:20.375
have to do it
on somebody else's dime.

11:20.418 --> 11:21.855
- What are you talking about?

11:21.898 --> 11:23.900
- Well, my people
ran the numbers back home.

11:23.944 --> 11:25.946
We don't like what we see.
- But this lot is a gold mine.

11:25.989 --> 11:27.730
- You just called it
a shithole.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.558
- Well, for right now,
but it's ripe for the picking.

11:29.601 --> 11:30.994
This whole goddamn
neighborhood is.

11:31.038 --> 11:33.344
- Well, the truth is
residential is for chumps.

11:33.388 --> 11:35.912
Concentration of assets,
tenant risk.

11:35.956 --> 11:37.740
A man of your stature
should know this.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.611
- No, what I know is
that your bank

11:39.655 --> 11:41.483
ran the numbers
on that months ago.

11:41.526 --> 11:43.572
- And months ago,
you were a player.

11:43.615 --> 11:45.052
Now...not so much.

11:45.095 --> 11:47.881
You're a high-risk investment.

11:47.924 --> 11:50.753
Sorry, Pat.
I liked hanging with you.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.581
Good steaks.

11:52.624 --> 11:55.497
You ever climb out of the hole
you're in, let me know.

12:08.640 --> 12:11.339
- It wasn't my idea to sideline
you from the Ickaris deal.

12:12.732 --> 12:13.602
- I don't care about that.
- What do you want?

12:14.908 --> 12:15.299
- I care about the mayor,
and based on the fact

12:16.866 --> 12:18.259
that you're going out of town
with him, I know you do, too.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.920
- What are you doing?
- I'm not judging you, Keri.

12:26.963 --> 12:28.748
- It sounds like you are.
- No, I'm here because

12:28.791 --> 12:29.966
something's going on
with the mayor,

12:30.010 --> 12:31.402
and he's not telling me
what it is.

12:31.446 --> 12:32.882
- Something's always going on
with Bobby.

12:32.926 --> 12:34.710
Do you want to
be more specific?

12:34.754 --> 12:36.799
- The mayor I know doesn't
grandstand in front the press,

12:36.843 --> 12:38.366
especially after what happened
to him with me.

12:38.409 --> 12:39.976
- I don't know
what to tell you.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.978
You came to the wrong person.
- Come on, Keri.

12:42.022 --> 12:44.938
You don't share a bed
with someone for five years

12:44.981 --> 12:46.156
and not know their secrets.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.810
- Wow.
- I'm sorry to be

12:47.854 --> 12:50.682
so straightforward,
but this is important.

12:50.726 --> 12:52.772
- What is it that
you think I know, Jessica?

12:52.815 --> 12:57.124
- I'm hoping you know what
Pat McGann just dropped on him.

12:57.167 --> 12:58.908
- Yeah, uh, I'm sorry.

12:58.952 --> 13:00.823
I actually really can't help
you because...

13:00.867 --> 13:03.130
he doesn't share
those secrets with me,

13:03.173 --> 13:04.827
and the reason
he doesn't is you.

13:04.871 --> 13:06.394
- Me?
- Yes, you.

13:06.437 --> 13:08.396
He brought you in to shield me,
believe it or not.

13:08.439 --> 13:11.965
I think his exact words were,
"She's already dirty."

13:13.836 --> 13:15.838
- I'm sorry to be
so straightforward.

13:18.493 --> 13:21.278
I really am sorry.
If I knew, I would tell you.

13:21.322 --> 13:22.845
But I don't.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.722
- Can I give you some advice?

13:30.766 --> 13:31.985
- If it's
about my relationship,

13:32.028 --> 13:33.813
I would rather you didn't.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.466
- Whatever the mayor's telling
you, as long as the two of you

13:35.510 --> 13:38.295
are together,
he can't shield you.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.306
- Any way we could do it today?

13:49.350 --> 13:50.873
- I've got
back-to-back meetings

13:50.917 --> 13:52.483
all day, Ms. Castillo.

13:52.527 --> 13:55.008
- Please, look,
my mom's not a criminal.

13:55.051 --> 13:58.925
I-I just can't stand to see her
locked up like that.

13:58.968 --> 14:00.491
- I'll tell you what.
You're at City Hall, right?

14:00.535 --> 14:02.406
- Yes.
- Can you meet me

14:02.450 --> 14:04.887
at that Jasper's place
across the street in an hour?

14:04.931 --> 14:06.280
- Yes.
- I'll be at one

14:06.323 --> 14:07.368
of the back tables.

14:07.411 --> 14:09.065
- Okay, thank you, thank you.

14:11.328 --> 14:14.244
- Remember Frank Cramer?
- Local 305 president.

14:14.288 --> 14:15.985
- Not anymore.
He got voted out.

14:16.029 --> 14:18.074
Went back into business
as a contractor.

14:18.118 --> 14:20.250
I need an address.
- Got it, Frank Cramer.

14:20.294 --> 14:21.512
- And when you're done
with that,

14:21.556 --> 14:23.210
I need you to go
to Buildings and Permits

14:23.253 --> 14:25.168
and pull a list
of all the outside contractors

14:25.212 --> 14:26.822
and the work that they've done
for the city

14:26.866 --> 14:28.084
over the past year.

14:28.128 --> 14:30.260
Vendors, suppliers--
I need all of it.

14:30.304 --> 14:32.175
- That department
closes early on Tuesdays.

14:32.219 --> 14:34.351
- Well, then you better hurry
up, because I need it now.

14:36.310 --> 14:39.052
Yoli, you've really
stepped it up since our talk.

14:39.095 --> 14:40.792
It hasn't gone unnoticed.

14:43.447 --> 14:45.362
- What's going on
with your mom--did you see her?

14:45.406 --> 14:47.190
- She's wearing
an orange jumpsuit.

14:47.234 --> 14:49.932
- Damn. What can I do to help?
Do you need a lawyer?

14:49.976 --> 14:51.107
- No, I got a lawyer.

14:51.151 --> 14:52.413
I'm supposed to meet him
in an hour.

14:52.456 --> 14:53.849
- Supposed to?
What does that mean?

14:53.893 --> 14:55.024
- It means that Jessica

14:55.068 --> 14:56.896
just dropped a shit ton
of work on me.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.506
Now I have to go to Buildings
and Permits before it closes.

14:58.549 --> 15:00.247
- Screw that! She can't expect
you not to have a personal life.

15:00.290 --> 15:01.901
Tell her that you have
a personal issue.

15:01.944 --> 15:03.424
- I can't do that.
I can't lose this job.

15:03.467 --> 15:05.556
- Yoli, this is your mother
we're talking about.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.255
- My mom came to this country
to give me a better life.

15:08.298 --> 15:12.041
If I lose the chance for one,
what was the point?

15:12.085 --> 15:13.260
- That's crazy.

15:13.303 --> 15:15.436
- Yeah, well,
it's what she wants.

15:15.479 --> 15:17.394
She made me promise.

15:17.438 --> 15:21.572
- Well, at least let me help.
- No, please.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.139
I can handle it.

15:33.106 --> 15:35.195
- Um...

15:35.238 --> 15:36.500
I just talked with Jessica

15:36.544 --> 15:38.372
about your announcement
this morning.

15:38.415 --> 15:40.983
- Oh, I'm sure she thinks
I'm getting out over my skis.

15:41.027 --> 15:43.377
- She thinks you got spooked
by McGann.

15:43.420 --> 15:45.205
- Everything is about
that guy to her.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.861
That's not an answer.

15:49.905 --> 15:52.038
- Oh, Jesus.

15:52.081 --> 15:53.953
Don't tell me you two
are a tag team now.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.867
That's not a fair fight.
- No.

15:55.911 --> 15:57.608
But you've been acting
really impulsive lately.

15:57.652 --> 15:59.523
You nearly bit Derrick's
head off this morning.

15:59.567 --> 16:02.004
Something's eating you.
- What's eating me

16:02.048 --> 16:04.441
is I just beat out 18 other
mayors to get this project,

16:04.485 --> 16:06.922
and I'm about to see
every one of them in L.A.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.489
You don't think we keep score?

16:08.532 --> 16:10.099
- So this whole thing
is about bragging rights?

16:10.143 --> 16:12.232
- Yeah, it is,
but it's also about momentum.

16:12.275 --> 16:14.016
If I go in there as a winner,

16:14.060 --> 16:17.019
I have the juice to push
my health-care initiative.

16:17.063 --> 16:18.629
- Okay, well,
if there is anything

16:18.673 --> 16:20.501
going on with McGann,
you can tell me.

16:20.544 --> 16:22.285
He knows about us.
He doesn't scare me.

16:22.329 --> 16:24.244
- He shouldn't.
McGann's a headache.

16:24.287 --> 16:28.378
No more, no less than anything
else I have to deal with.

16:28.422 --> 16:31.338
Instead of worrying, you should
be thinking about L.A.

16:38.214 --> 16:40.651
- You are so full of shit.

16:40.695 --> 16:43.045
Work on your speech, winner.

16:52.185 --> 16:54.013
- Aren't we brave today?

16:54.056 --> 16:56.015
- Oh, not my first time
at a construction site.

16:56.058 --> 16:57.494
- Maybe not, but I bet

16:57.538 --> 16:59.540
it's the first time
for those Saint Laurents.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.281
- You know your shoes.

17:01.324 --> 17:05.024
- Hi, my name is Mia,
and I have a problem.

17:05.067 --> 17:06.982
It's a small problem,
but the collection's fierce.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.158
- Hello, Mia.
I'm looking for Frank Cramer.

17:09.202 --> 17:10.377
- Right through there.

17:12.379 --> 17:14.120
- If you're looking
to shut me down,

17:14.163 --> 17:17.123
this place is up to code--
same deal with my workers.

17:17.166 --> 17:18.689
- I'm not looking
to shut you down.

17:18.733 --> 17:20.387
I'm here to help you.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.693
- I can't wait to hear this.

17:22.737 --> 17:24.478
- How would you like to have

17:24.521 --> 17:27.959
the construction contract
on the Ickaris project?

17:28.003 --> 17:31.093
Look around, lady.

17:31.137 --> 17:33.530
Does it look like I can handle
a project of that size?

17:33.574 --> 17:35.358
- Why don't you let me
worry about that?

17:35.402 --> 17:37.708
- You're serious.

17:37.752 --> 17:39.362
Why are you doing this?

17:39.406 --> 17:41.408
- Because I feel sick
about what I did to you.

17:41.451 --> 17:44.063
- I'm not buying that.
- It's true, Frank.

17:44.106 --> 17:47.979
What I did to you and your
family haunts me every day.

17:48.023 --> 17:50.112
- Good, it should.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.722
But someone like you
doesn't do anything

17:51.766 --> 17:53.420
out of the goodness
of your heart.

17:53.463 --> 17:56.727
It's always transactional.

17:56.771 --> 17:59.078
So tell me what the hell
you want, or get out.

17:59.121 --> 18:01.080
- I want to know about
Tommy Diehl's disappearance.

18:01.123 --> 18:02.516
- Drop dead.

18:02.559 --> 18:05.258
- You've been around the unions
30 years, Frank.

18:05.301 --> 18:08.261
You know things.
- Yeah, that's right.

18:08.304 --> 18:10.741
30 years it took me
to get where I was.

18:10.785 --> 18:14.441
And you took it away.
- Then let me help you.

18:14.484 --> 18:17.400
I hate Pat McGann
every bit as much as you do,

18:17.444 --> 18:19.576
and if I'm going to do
anything about him,

18:19.620 --> 18:22.188
I need to know about Diehl.

18:22.231 --> 18:24.233
- You're living
in a fantasy world.

18:24.277 --> 18:27.497
- About taking down McGann?
- No, about getting us that bid.

18:27.541 --> 18:29.412
None of your clout's
going to make that happen.

18:29.456 --> 18:32.154
We're a start-up
that does gut rehab.

18:32.198 --> 18:33.634
And without
that woman out there,

18:33.677 --> 18:35.244
I don't even get that done.

18:35.288 --> 18:37.594
- Well, like I said,
you let me worry about that.

18:37.638 --> 18:39.727
And if I can get it for you...

18:39.770 --> 18:42.382
- Yeah, sure,
knock yourself out.

18:42.425 --> 18:45.167
Yeah, get me the contract,
then we'll talk.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.649
- I need to talk to you.

18:48.692 --> 18:50.694
Um, something happened.

18:50.738 --> 18:52.479
- What do you mean
something happened?

18:52.522 --> 18:54.133
- It didn't go as planned.

18:54.176 --> 18:57.048
- Oh, God damn it.
Stop mumbling.

18:57.092 --> 18:58.615
- He's dead.

18:58.659 --> 19:01.488
He's dead.

19:01.531 --> 19:03.794
He's dead.

19:03.838 --> 19:06.319
He's dead.

19:23.945 --> 19:25.729
- Shit.

19:25.773 --> 19:28.732
Excuse me?
Excuse me?

19:28.776 --> 19:31.561
Hi, was someone
just sitting here?

19:31.605 --> 19:33.259
Suit and tie maybe?

19:33.302 --> 19:35.609
- Um, there--
there was a guy here,

19:35.652 --> 19:37.393
but, um, he--he just left.

19:37.437 --> 19:38.873
- Okay, thanks.

19:46.968 --> 19:48.622
- This is Richard Meyers.

19:48.665 --> 19:50.493
I am out of the office
or in court.

19:50.537 --> 19:52.539
Please leave a message.

19:55.368 --> 19:56.717
- Got a minute?
- I do.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.545
Have you seen Yoli?

19:58.588 --> 20:00.329
- Well, the girl's allowed
to leave her desk, you know?

20:00.373 --> 20:01.852
- I didn't say she couldn't.

20:01.896 --> 20:03.811
Is that what you came in here
to tell me?

20:03.854 --> 20:05.943
- You asked.

20:05.987 --> 20:07.815
- Let's start again.

20:07.858 --> 20:09.686
What can I do
for you, Derrick?

20:09.730 --> 20:12.472
- Well, with all due respect,
you can start

20:12.515 --> 20:14.256
by telling me why it seems
like you're interested

20:14.300 --> 20:15.692
in construction bids
on Ickaris.

20:15.736 --> 20:17.607
- If you must know,

20:17.651 --> 20:19.783
I'm interested in getting
that contract for Frank Cramer.

20:19.827 --> 20:21.611
- So you think
that's how it works?

20:21.655 --> 20:23.874
We just hand out favors...
Like that?

20:23.918 --> 20:26.834
No legitimate bidding process?
- It's important, Derrick.

20:26.877 --> 20:28.270
I wouldn't do it unless--

20:28.314 --> 20:29.576
- Unless you
owed him something.

20:29.619 --> 20:30.925
I don't doubt that.

20:30.968 --> 20:32.492
But there's no way
Cramer's getting that job.

20:32.535 --> 20:34.233
- Why?
Because he's undermanned?

20:34.276 --> 20:35.973
We can pair him
with another team--

20:36.017 --> 20:39.368
- No, it's because he's white.
- Excuse me?

20:39.412 --> 20:42.719
- Bobby made a commitment
to award at least 10%

20:42.763 --> 20:45.505
of all city contracts
to minority-owned businesses.

20:45.548 --> 20:48.464
MBE--
Minority Business Enterprise.

20:48.508 --> 20:50.466
And do you know how many
we've handed out since then?

20:50.510 --> 20:52.468
One.

20:52.512 --> 20:54.731
I didn't like this whole
development to begin with,

20:54.775 --> 20:57.299
but if I'm going to keep
being his press secretary,

20:57.343 --> 20:59.519
I'm definitely going to hold
his feet to the fire.

20:59.562 --> 21:01.390
- I didn't know
about the program.

21:01.434 --> 21:03.697
And from now on, I promise
I will work with you on this.

21:03.740 --> 21:06.656
- Uh-uh, no "from now on."
We're doing it now.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.919
I don't know what
backroom-favor bullshit

21:08.963 --> 21:10.660
you got going on,
but I am not with you on this.

21:10.704 --> 21:12.314
- Derrick--
- When you came in,

21:12.358 --> 21:13.837
I thought,
"Maybe there's somebody

21:13.881 --> 21:16.405
who will put cause
above politics."

21:16.449 --> 21:19.843
No attachments,
no baggage, no debts.

21:19.887 --> 21:23.325
But now I know
why Bobby brought you in...

21:23.369 --> 21:27.329
'cause you're the biggest,
baddest operator around.

21:35.859 --> 21:38.732
- Yeah, I-I know we talked
about February.

21:38.775 --> 21:41.561
I-I just want to see
how a few things pan out.

21:41.604 --> 21:43.911
- Dad, what's wrong?
You sound down.

21:43.954 --> 21:46.566
- Ah, it's just
these guys out here.

21:46.609 --> 21:48.829
They don't have the same
work ethic as they used to.

21:48.872 --> 21:52.006
Yeah, I'll call you later,
sweetheart.

21:52.049 --> 21:53.921
Not now, Nicky.

21:53.964 --> 21:56.750
- Don't you fucking Nicky me.

21:56.793 --> 21:59.883
You have any idea
why I called you that night?

21:59.927 --> 22:01.668
You were always
more of a father to me

22:01.711 --> 22:03.365
than that piece of shit
that slept with my mother.

22:03.409 --> 22:05.628
That's why.
- Hey, Pete was a stand-up guy.

22:05.672 --> 22:07.761
He didn't
have to look after you.

22:07.804 --> 22:09.415
- He didn't.
You did.

22:09.458 --> 22:11.460
You were the one
who was there for me.

22:11.504 --> 22:13.636
I leaned on you
for everything--

22:13.680 --> 22:17.423
how to drive,
how to throw a splitter.

22:17.466 --> 22:20.730
Hell, you're the reason
I got into the Academy.

22:20.774 --> 22:24.430
I'd run through a wall for you,
and you know that.

22:24.473 --> 22:27.041
And this?
This how you reward that?

22:27.084 --> 22:28.912
- I didn't want to use it,
all right?

22:28.956 --> 22:30.784
Bobby left me no choice.
- Bullshit.

22:30.827 --> 22:33.003
You could've destroyed
that thing a long time ago.

22:33.047 --> 22:35.832
You had a choice.
- You had a choice, too.

22:35.876 --> 22:37.921
Nobody told you
to kill Tommy Diehl.

22:37.965 --> 22:40.620
- Right.
"Take care of him"?

22:40.663 --> 22:41.882
Right.

22:41.925 --> 22:44.101
- You better
get out of here, Nicky.

22:44.145 --> 22:47.409
- Or what?
You going to take care of me?

22:49.455 --> 22:52.458
You know what you
showed me with that thing?

22:52.501 --> 22:54.416
You showed me that
you're nothing

22:54.460 --> 22:56.592
without someone in City Hall
ready to make a deal for you.

22:57.811 --> 22:59.421
You're nothing.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.771
- You ungrateful
son of a bitch!

23:08.038 --> 23:10.606
- Aah!

23:30.974 --> 23:32.933
Motherf--

23:37.720 --> 23:39.026
- Superintendent's office.

23:39.069 --> 23:40.157
Yeah, it's Pat McGann.

23:40.201 --> 23:41.855
Get me Superintendent Hargrove

23:41.898 --> 23:44.510
and tell him
one of his guys assaulted me.

23:44.553 --> 23:46.512
- I'll give him the message.

23:53.388 --> 23:55.651
- Where's Nick?
- Outside, I assume.

23:56.522 --> 23:57.653
Why?
- You didn't hear?

23:59.046 --> 24:00.395
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
What did he do?

24:00.439 --> 24:02.136
- Well, it seems like
you already know.

24:02.179 --> 24:05.182
- God damn it, Chuck,
just tell me.

24:05.226 --> 24:08.664
- He went after Pat McGann,
broke two of his ribs.

24:13.539 --> 24:16.237
I'm surprised
he could find his ribs.

24:16.280 --> 24:19.327
- Okay, well, all the fat
jokes aside, this is no joke.

24:19.370 --> 24:21.416
- I know.
- McGann is no joke.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.113
- I know.
- He's threatening action

24:23.157 --> 24:25.202
against the department
if I don't take his badge away.

24:25.246 --> 24:27.291
- Oh, shit.
- Now, look, I gave him to you

24:27.335 --> 24:28.989
because I know what
he is to you.

24:29.032 --> 24:30.947
- I'll talk to him.

24:30.991 --> 24:34.255
- The kid's got demons, Bobby.
- I said I'll talk to him.

24:50.184 --> 24:53.187
Okay, I see how it is.

24:53.230 --> 24:55.319
So this is how it goes down
every evening.

24:55.363 --> 24:59.367
- No, sometimes I have
an army of little men

24:59.410 --> 25:03.240
who fan me with palm fronds
and feed me grapes.

25:03.284 --> 25:06.287
- You know that joke doesn't
work when you got all of this.

25:07.854 --> 25:10.900
Can I get you a glass?
- Hell, yeah.

25:14.556 --> 25:18.125
- So how was your day?
-  Oh, lots of fun.

25:18.168 --> 25:21.084
Just another day
of sponge baths,

25:21.128 --> 25:24.174
gunshot wounds,
and angry patients.

25:24.218 --> 25:26.394
Thank you.
And...

25:26.437 --> 25:29.266
then I had to go back to the
apartment and grab some things,

25:29.310 --> 25:31.965
quickly come back here
to drop it off,

25:32.008 --> 25:33.923
and then go back to work.

25:39.929 --> 25:42.366
- Hard going back there, huh?
- Beyond.

25:42.410 --> 25:44.804
All those people
forced out of their homes.

25:44.847 --> 25:47.110
They're just like,
"Angie, where you been at?

25:47.154 --> 25:48.982
We didn't even see you leave."

25:49.025 --> 25:52.594
And...I feel so guilty

25:52.638 --> 25:56.293
to tell them
that I'm staying here.

25:56.337 --> 25:59.949
You're a good person,
Jessica Pearson.

25:59.993 --> 26:01.472
- Am I?

26:03.562 --> 26:05.607
- What's going on, cousin?

26:07.522 --> 26:10.612
- Just, um--a man I-I did
some business with

26:10.656 --> 26:14.137
got in my head
a little bit, that's all.

26:14.181 --> 26:15.486
- How so?

26:17.880 --> 26:19.142
- The words he used--

26:19.186 --> 26:23.973
he, uh--he described me
as transactional.

26:24.017 --> 26:25.627
- Transactional.

26:25.671 --> 26:28.978
Sounds like one of
Cory's spelling words.

26:29.022 --> 26:31.024
- I'm serious.
- I know you are.

26:31.067 --> 26:33.287
And I know you're not
doing all of this

26:33.330 --> 26:35.028
for something in return.

26:35.071 --> 26:38.292
- I get joy in my home.
- You know what I mean.

26:38.335 --> 26:40.033
You didn't have to
let us stay here.

26:40.076 --> 26:42.470
- What about those people
you just left in the projects?

26:42.513 --> 26:45.647
I'm not helping them.

26:45.691 --> 26:49.651
- You can't change things
single-handedly.

26:49.695 --> 26:52.523
- I tell myself...

26:52.567 --> 26:55.483
I took this job
to make a difference.

26:55.526 --> 26:58.660
And sometimes I...

26:58.704 --> 27:00.009
- What?

27:02.403 --> 27:05.493
- Sometimes I think I'm...

27:05.536 --> 27:09.192
that same ambitious woman

27:09.236 --> 27:11.325
who ran that law firm.

27:13.588 --> 27:15.677
- Then don't be.

27:27.167 --> 27:30.170
- Ms. Castillo?
- Oh, my God, Mr. Meyers.

27:30.213 --> 27:32.346
Hi, hi.
- Hi. How are you?

27:32.389 --> 27:35.262
- Oh, my God, I am so sorry
about yesterday.

27:35.305 --> 27:37.525
- Oh, I-I-I wasn't
trying to be cruel,

27:37.568 --> 27:39.135
but I had another appointment.

27:39.179 --> 27:41.050
- No, yeah, I'm sure you're
very busy these days.

27:41.094 --> 27:42.269
- Yeah, well...

27:42.312 --> 27:44.488
- So can you get
my mom out of there?

27:44.532 --> 27:46.229
- Is she claiming asylum?

27:46.273 --> 27:48.405
- Oh, no.
No, no, she's not. Um...

27:48.449 --> 27:49.929
- Well, I-I'll be honest
with you.

27:49.972 --> 27:52.322
In this climate...
- Mm-hmm.

27:52.366 --> 27:54.673
- Asylum is really
the best way to stay in.

27:54.716 --> 27:58.415
But I'm usually able
to get a hearing

27:58.459 --> 28:01.027
and a temporary release.

28:01.070 --> 28:03.507
- You mean a bond.
Yeah, okay.

28:03.551 --> 28:05.205
I have...

28:05.248 --> 28:07.207
Here...

28:07.250 --> 28:10.079
Here's $1,500.

28:10.123 --> 28:12.691
- Um, that's just for the bond.

28:12.734 --> 28:15.215
But you do know my fee
is another $600?

28:17.304 --> 28:21.438
- N-no, my--my dad said
it was only $1,500.

28:21.482 --> 28:23.266
- For the bond.

28:25.312 --> 28:27.401
- Okay. Um...

28:27.444 --> 28:30.534
- Uh, look, you know what?
You--you can owe me the rest.

28:30.578 --> 28:32.972
- Really?
- Yeah, just don't tell anyone.

28:33.015 --> 28:34.451
I'm trying to make
a living here.

28:34.495 --> 28:36.279
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.

28:36.323 --> 28:37.716
Thank you.
- Hey, look.

28:37.759 --> 28:39.456
I-I have to get to court.
I'm so sorry.

28:39.500 --> 28:43.547
- Oh, absolutely, yeah.
Okay, um, we'll talk, right?

28:43.591 --> 28:46.289
- I'll be in touch.
- Yes, thank you.

28:53.296 --> 28:55.603
- Come on, boys,
I don't want to wake Grandma.

28:55.646 --> 28:57.344
Baby, what are you doing
under the couch?

28:57.387 --> 29:00.216
- He can't find his bear.
- I thought I got your bear.

29:00.260 --> 29:02.392
- The little bear.

29:02.436 --> 29:05.482
Oh, I'm sorry.

29:05.526 --> 29:07.441
- Can you go back?
- I can't.

29:07.484 --> 29:10.009
I got to go into work, baby.

29:10.052 --> 29:13.273
Well, listen,
when things quiet down tonight,

29:13.316 --> 29:15.492
I'll try to slip out
and get it, okay?

29:15.536 --> 29:19.322
- Promise, Mommy?
- I promise, baby.

29:19.366 --> 29:20.759
All right, let's go.

29:23.152 --> 29:26.503
- Let me guess.
First one in, last one out.

29:26.547 --> 29:28.767
- Frank's at a meeting.
Should be here any minute.

29:28.810 --> 29:31.334
- I'm not looking for Frank.
I'm looking for you.

29:31.378 --> 29:34.294
- If you want someone to roll
on Frank, look somewhere else.

29:34.337 --> 29:35.643
- He told you about me.

29:35.686 --> 29:38.037
- I don't like
what you did to him.

29:38.080 --> 29:40.648
Frank's family.
He's always been there for me.

29:40.691 --> 29:44.695
- And yet he never
made you foreman, did he?

29:44.739 --> 29:46.349
I did my homework.

29:46.393 --> 29:48.787
You were a rock star
at that union.

29:48.830 --> 29:50.397
- You'll have to
ask Frank about that.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.181
- No, I think
we both know why.

29:52.225 --> 29:54.053
What kind of a union boss
would he be

29:54.096 --> 29:56.620
if he let a woman run his crew?

29:56.664 --> 30:00.102
Look, I'm not trying to drive
a wedge between you two.

30:00.146 --> 30:02.148
I just want you
to get what you deserve.

30:02.191 --> 30:04.150
- And how are you
going to do that?

30:08.763 --> 30:11.157
$800,000?

30:12.375 --> 30:13.724
What's this for?

30:13.768 --> 30:16.205
- Your half
of Frank's business.

30:16.249 --> 30:18.338
- What makes you think
it's for sale?

30:18.381 --> 30:20.819
- It will be if Frank
wants the Ickaris contract

30:20.862 --> 30:23.082
or any other development
coming down the pike.

30:25.562 --> 30:27.477
- You want to make this
a minority-owned business.

30:27.521 --> 30:31.307
- The mayor has made
a commitment to the community.

30:31.351 --> 30:33.179
- I don't know.
I don't like it.

30:33.222 --> 30:35.181
- Now, I know
what you're thinking.

30:35.224 --> 30:37.400
It's not fraud.

30:37.444 --> 30:40.708
It's an investment in you.

30:40.751 --> 30:44.799
51% of the company
is in your name.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.584
You pay me back when you can.

30:47.628 --> 30:49.586
And I'm sure you'll still be
the first one in

30:49.630 --> 30:51.414
and the last one out.

31:04.166 --> 31:06.212
- You wanted to see me?

31:09.258 --> 31:10.912
- Sit down, Nick.
- I don't want to sit down

31:10.956 --> 31:13.480
for a lecture, Bobby,
so let's just get to it.

31:16.831 --> 31:19.616
- You're going to cop
an attitude after what you did?

31:19.660 --> 31:21.401
I told you
to stay away from him.

31:21.444 --> 31:23.229
- You're not the one
going to jail.

31:23.272 --> 31:24.795
- I'm not what?
- You're not the one going

31:24.839 --> 31:25.796
to jail if that tape comes out.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.537
- I'm the fucking mayor!

31:27.581 --> 31:31.367
I'm so tired of this "I'm on
an island" martyr bullshit.

31:31.411 --> 31:33.239
You are not alone.

31:33.282 --> 31:34.762
It's you and me.

31:34.805 --> 31:36.938
How many times
do I have to tell you that?

31:36.982 --> 31:40.289
- Good. Then I did
your dirty work today.

31:40.333 --> 31:42.639
Can I go now?

31:50.473 --> 31:53.302
- I don't know, Nicky.

31:53.346 --> 31:55.304
- You don't know what?

32:01.354 --> 32:04.618
Did you call me in
to suspend me, Bobby?

32:04.661 --> 32:06.620
- You put me in a hard place.

32:06.663 --> 32:10.841
- Yeah, and you can do
whatever you want.

32:10.885 --> 32:12.452
- I'm not your boss.

32:12.495 --> 32:14.671
- No, Hargrove is.

32:14.715 --> 32:17.979
And you're his.

32:18.023 --> 32:20.677
Or maybe it's McGann...

32:20.721 --> 32:22.462
or Lauder...

32:22.505 --> 32:25.378
or who the hell
knows anymore.

33:00.021 --> 33:01.762
- I'm not interested
in your payoff.

33:02.458 --> 33:03.242
- It's not a payoff.

33:04.547 --> 33:05.853
- You expect me to believe that,
coming from you?

33:07.420 --> 33:08.334
- No, I don't, but I am trying
to offer you an opportunity.

33:09.683 --> 33:10.292
- You're saying I'm getting
the Ickaris contract?

33:11.119 --> 33:12.033
- I can't make that promise,

33:13.252 --> 33:14.340
but if not that,
it will be something else.

33:14.383 --> 33:17.734
- Because this puts me
in the MBE

33:17.778 --> 33:19.867
as long as I give up
control of my company.

33:19.910 --> 33:22.913
- 49% of something
is better than 100% of nothing.

33:22.957 --> 33:25.829
Do you really want to do gut
rehab the rest of your life?

33:25.873 --> 33:28.658
- I'd get by.
- Look around you, Frank.

33:28.702 --> 33:31.400
The world is changing,
and there's a reason

33:31.444 --> 33:34.403
you brought Mia over
from Local 305.

33:34.447 --> 33:36.753
You're saying
she hasn't earned this?

33:38.886 --> 33:41.106
- All of this to find out
about Tommy Diehl?

33:41.149 --> 33:43.717
- Nope, I'm trying
to make things right.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.414
So...

33:45.458 --> 33:47.982
go ahead, take it.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.811
Leave right now.

33:50.854 --> 33:52.856
You don't owe me a thing.

34:07.001 --> 34:09.917
- You know, Diehl wasn't
a friend to anyone.

34:09.960 --> 34:13.094
He had his crew,
but he was a criminal.

34:13.138 --> 34:17.316
He stole from everyone,
and he blackmailed everyone.

34:17.359 --> 34:19.840
- Who took over the union
when he disappeared?

34:19.883 --> 34:22.451
- For a while,
Bobby's old man did.

34:22.495 --> 34:25.106
He took over, and suddenly,

34:25.150 --> 34:28.153
McGann had no problems
with the unions.

34:30.155 --> 34:33.158
Go ahead, ask,
I know what you're thinking.

34:33.201 --> 34:36.030
Did McGann kill him?

34:36.074 --> 34:37.858
- Did he?

34:37.901 --> 34:40.165
- McGann's too smart
to get his hands dirty.

34:40.208 --> 34:44.343
He's always had bagmen
to do things like that for him.

34:44.386 --> 34:47.476
- I have no idea who did
his dirty work for him then.

34:47.520 --> 34:50.479
- You don't need to.

34:50.523 --> 34:52.481
You know who does it now.

36:08.862 --> 36:11.952
- Ms. Pearson.
I'll be driving you tonight.

36:11.995 --> 36:14.476
- Where's Nick?
- I don't know, ma'am.

36:14.520 --> 36:16.478
I just do as I'm told.

36:26.445 --> 36:30.318
- Last time I was in here,
you weren't so nice to me.

36:30.362 --> 36:34.583
I was hoping this time, I'll get
a little better treatment.

36:34.627 --> 36:38.152
- I suspended Nick
without pay.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.893
Happy now?

36:39.936 --> 36:41.503
- Yeah, it's a start.

36:41.547 --> 36:45.507
- I had to stand in here
and suspend my own brother.

36:47.292 --> 36:48.989
That's not enough for you?

36:49.032 --> 36:51.252
- I could've gotten
Chuck Hargrove to do that.

36:51.296 --> 36:53.994
I didn't need you.

37:02.307 --> 37:04.309
- What do you want?

37:04.352 --> 37:08.182
- I've decided to put Ickaris
on my site.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.013
- What the hell
are you talking about?

37:13.056 --> 37:14.623
- Think about it, Mr. Mayor.

37:14.667 --> 37:16.930
I get a more
profitable development,

37:16.973 --> 37:19.628
and you deliver a shitload
of jobs to the 54th.

37:19.672 --> 37:23.197
I-I believe
you call that a win-win.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.982
- That deal is signed.
I went public.

37:26.026 --> 37:27.593
- You and I both know
that's not true.

37:27.636 --> 37:30.160
You were just trying
to show me who's boss.

37:30.204 --> 37:33.338
Look, there's no point
having a tape

37:33.381 --> 37:36.210
if I won't actually use it.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.908
And I will use it, Bobby.

37:38.952 --> 37:42.085
I'm under it, my old friend.
I got nothing left.

37:42.129 --> 37:45.524
Chan pulled out of North Park.
That was my last shot.

37:49.397 --> 37:51.051
- Christ.

37:54.097 --> 37:56.535
- We can both go down,

37:56.578 --> 37:58.363
or we can both survive.

37:58.406 --> 38:01.670
- I'm the last person Ickaris
wants to sit down with.

38:03.977 --> 38:06.066
They'll never trust
a word I say again.

38:08.242 --> 38:10.244
- Well, then you better
get on the first plane

38:10.288 --> 38:12.377
to Seattle and make them.

38:23.257 --> 38:25.390
- Shit!

38:28.393 --> 38:32.266
- Hey, do you need help with--
- No, thank you.

38:32.310 --> 38:35.008
I'm good.
Thank you.

38:36.749 --> 38:38.707
Thanks.

38:38.751 --> 38:41.101
- Look, I know you think
I'm always trying

38:41.144 --> 38:43.321
to save you or some shit.

38:45.279 --> 38:47.150
Are you okay?

38:50.110 --> 38:52.547
I got conned.
- What?

38:52.591 --> 38:56.290
- I got conned
by the immigration lawyer.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.248
- What do you mean conned?

38:58.292 --> 39:00.294
- He never showed up
to my mom's bond hearing.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.296
He just took my money,
and he never showed.

39:02.340 --> 39:05.604
- Are you sure it wasn't some
kind of mix-up or something?

39:05.647 --> 39:07.997
- No, I asked around in court,
and these people do this

39:08.041 --> 39:09.999
all the time because
we're undocumented

39:10.043 --> 39:13.742
or we don't have
any money, or...

39:13.786 --> 39:16.745
Oh, God.

39:16.789 --> 39:18.704
I don't know what else to do.

39:21.184 --> 39:24.100
- Look who's office you're in.

39:24.144 --> 39:27.234
- Derrick, I--
- Either you tell her...

39:27.277 --> 39:29.062
or I will.

39:40.813 --> 39:43.424
Oh, hi.
Good, you can help me choose.

39:43.468 --> 39:45.165
I've been over-packing

39:45.208 --> 39:47.559
'cause I never get
to go anywhere, so...

39:47.602 --> 39:49.648
And I know they say it's
way too cold this time of year,

39:49.691 --> 39:51.432
but I'm definitely going to...

39:53.521 --> 39:55.349
- Lay out.

39:58.221 --> 39:59.788
It's fine.

39:59.832 --> 40:01.790
It's fine. I have a lot of work
to do here, actually.

40:01.834 --> 40:03.618
- No, you have to go.
- What?

40:03.662 --> 40:07.056
- I need to go to Seattle.
- What? Why? What happened?

40:07.100 --> 40:09.798
- The CEO wasn't happy
we jumped the gun.

40:09.842 --> 40:12.801
I need to go smooth
some things over.

40:12.845 --> 40:15.674
- Why didn't they call me?
I'm the one that made the deal.

40:15.717 --> 40:18.633
- I don't know. I guess they
want to make me dance.

40:18.677 --> 40:20.809
- You know, the funny thing
about sleeping

40:20.853 --> 40:22.811
with your own city attorney
is she knows when you're lying.

40:22.855 --> 40:24.509
- I'm not--
- Please don't lie to me.

40:24.552 --> 40:27.816
- I'm not--
- Don't lie...

40:27.860 --> 40:29.339
not to me.

40:34.432 --> 40:36.825
- I have to go get Ickaris
for McGann.

40:36.869 --> 40:39.349
- What?

40:41.743 --> 40:43.528
I can't get into it.

40:45.791 --> 40:48.794
- Oh, my God, she's right.
He has you.

40:48.837 --> 40:50.535
- You know I owe him.

40:50.578 --> 40:53.538
- No, if--if he can do this,
it's more than owing him.

40:53.581 --> 40:55.540
What are you into, Bobby?

40:57.629 --> 41:00.109
- I'll call you from there.

41:21.348 --> 41:24.743
- Going somewhere?
- Yeah, something like that.

41:24.786 --> 41:27.441
- I heard what happened.

41:29.225 --> 41:32.533
Nick, no matter what's
going on, I can help you.

41:32.577 --> 41:35.580
- You?
- I know you don't believe me.

41:35.623 --> 41:37.538
- What the hell
are you doing here, Jessica?

41:37.582 --> 41:39.279
I mean, really?

41:39.322 --> 41:40.889
- I'm trying to make
a difference in this city.

41:40.933 --> 41:42.674
- You keep saying that,
but I don't buy it.

41:42.717 --> 41:44.545
- I can't do a damn thing

41:44.589 --> 41:46.765
as long as the mayor
is compromised.

41:46.808 --> 41:48.897
- Then why aren't you
talking to him?

41:48.941 --> 41:50.769
- He's not the one running.

41:56.296 --> 41:58.907
- You killed Tommy Diehl
for McGann, didn't you?

42:01.649 --> 42:04.522
Running isn't going to solve
the problem.

42:04.565 --> 42:07.612
Not for you,
not for your brother.

42:09.527 --> 42:12.268
I can help you.

42:12.312 --> 42:14.793
Let me help you.

42:55.573 --> 42:56.835
- Oy.
