WEBVTT

00:03.053 --> 00:04.620
Don't tell me this is what it looks like.

00:05.024 --> 00:05.880
It's escargot.

00:06.320 --> 00:07.590
That's what it looks like.

00:07.825 --> 00:08.362
Snails?

00:08.778 --> 00:09.479
Escargot.

00:09.744 --> 00:11.068
Slimy thing by any other name...

00:11.163 --> 00:12.807
They taste like garlic and butter.

00:12.879 --> 00:13.585
Don't say "they."

00:13.728 --> 00:15.680
- Food should not have pronouns. 
- Give it a try.

00:15.787 --> 00:18.419
But if I do and we're having road kill for the main course,

00:18.494 --> 00:19.894
then I will already have used up my allotment

00:19.970 --> 00:22.352
of gross-out food for the day, so I'll abstain.

00:22.432 --> 00:23.846
I guess we should strike escargot

00:23.994 --> 00:25.792
off the list of Friday night dinner foods.

00:25.878 --> 00:27.241
Sweetie loved escargot.

00:27.885 --> 00:29.574
That's funny how we remember those things.

00:30.365 --> 00:32.037
- Sweetie? 
- Sweetie who?

00:32.369 --> 00:34.157
Sweetie Nelson, one of my oldest friends.

00:34.235 --> 00:35.345
She passed away yesterday.

00:35.571 --> 00:36.590
Oh, I'm sorry, Grandma.

00:36.722 --> 00:38.135
Yeah, I've heard you mention her.

00:38.253 --> 00:38.965
Was she sick?

00:39.098 --> 00:40.833
She'd been ill for some time, but still...

00:40.942 --> 00:42.133
The family is pretty overwhelmed.

00:42.222 --> 00:43.779
By the way, Davis called late today.

00:43.866 --> 00:44.997
The funeral is going to be Sunday.

00:45.109 --> 00:46.430
Was that her real name -- Sweetie?

00:46.543 --> 00:48.581
No, her name was Melinda. Sweetie was a nickname.

00:48.689 --> 00:49.365
Why?

00:49.738 --> 00:50.464
What do you mean, why?

00:50.593 --> 00:52.656
I mean, how did they get Sweetie from Melinda?

00:52.770 --> 00:55.109
They didn't get Sweetie from Melinda. Sweetie is a nickname.

00:55.345 --> 00:57.598
Yes, I know Sweetie was a nickname,

00:57.694 --> 01:00.576
but usually, a nickname comes from a version of your name,

01:00.679 --> 01:02.379
or there's a story behind the name or something.

01:03.031 --> 01:04.620
She was sweet. That's the story.

01:06.342 --> 01:07.545
She had a very sweet nature.

01:08.760 --> 01:11.104
Well, what kind of story did you want, Lorelai?

01:11.493 --> 01:12.798
No, that's fine. She was sweet.

01:12.901 --> 01:14.519
They called her Sweetie. It's a good story.

01:14.672 --> 01:16.573
No, really. Exactly what kind of story

01:16.674 --> 01:18.709
about my recently departed friend would amuse you?

01:18.878 --> 01:21.129
- Mom, it's not to amuse me. It's... 
- All right, fine.

01:21.999 --> 01:24.150
Sweetie's father was a very poor man,

01:24.288 --> 01:28.440
so poor that Sweetie and her four siblings all had to sleep in a hollowed-out tree trunk

01:28.564 --> 01:30.509
because the house was only big enough for their parents.

01:30.991 --> 01:34.205
One winter, there was no food, so Sweetie crawled out of her trunk,

01:34.293 --> 01:35.609
wrapped her feet in newspaper,

01:35.709 --> 01:38.142
and walked forty miles in the snow to the nearest town,

01:38.245 --> 01:40.334
where she stumbled into a candy store.

01:40.620 --> 01:43.247
The owner took pity on her and gave her bags of candy,

01:43.350 --> 01:45.562
a dill pickle, and drove her back to her family.

01:45.776 --> 01:47.799
He promptly offered a job to her father,

01:47.870 --> 01:51.015
who gladly accepted and eventually owned that store

01:51.117 --> 01:54.270
and turned it into one of the most important candy emporiums in the world.

01:54.522 --> 01:56.648
And that is how she got the name Sweetie.

01:57.061 --> 01:58.060
There, how was that?

01:58.233 --> 01:59.365
Now, that was a pretty good story.

01:59.534 --> 02:01.819
I'm sorry, Emily, did you say the funeral is Sunday?

02:01.935 --> 02:03.073
Yes. Is that a problem?

02:03.237 --> 02:04.362
Well, Mr. Hamoto is in town,

02:04.481 --> 02:07.317
and Jason has set up golf for him, and then there's lunch after that.

02:07.868 --> 02:10.639
- What time is the service? 
- Noon.

02:10.818 --> 02:12.841
Oh, noon. That's cutting it very close.

02:13.020 --> 02:15.484
How important is it for me to be at the funeral?

02:15.974 --> 02:18.443
- Not important at all. 
- Well, fine, then.

02:18.574 --> 02:19.953
Be sure to give them my condolences.

02:20.409 --> 02:22.160
Of course. Eat your food.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.382
I think one of them is still alive.

02:24.556 --> 02:25.852
- Lorelai! 
- No, seriously.

02:25.985 --> 02:27.854
He was over near the radish like five minutes ago.

03:24.012 --> 03:26.770
- This doesn't smell right. 
- Smells fine, Kirk.

03:26.944 --> 03:29.166
- I think the eggs were bad. 
- The eggs are fine, Kirk.

03:29.365 --> 03:30.523
Were they cooked in the fish pan?

03:30.599 --> 03:32.095
They smell like they were cooked in the fish pan.

03:32.223 --> 03:33.702
No, the eggs were not cooked in the fish pan.

03:33.794 --> 03:34.680
They were cooked in the egg pan.

03:34.905 --> 03:37.517
Was the fish pan sitting next to the egg pan? Because perhaps...

03:37.593 --> 03:38.634
I need something with cheese!

03:38.802 --> 03:39.933
Lorelai, smell my eggs.

03:40.092 --> 03:41.751
Not today, Kirk. Hey, where's Luke?

03:42.023 --> 03:44.726
I want him to make that breakfast quesadilla thing he made yesterday.

03:44.854 --> 03:45.509
Luke's not here.

03:45.939 --> 03:46.620
Where is he?

03:46.912 --> 03:48.760
He knows the exact right jack-to-cheddar ratio.

03:48.935 --> 03:49.943
- He's out there. 
- Where?

03:50.112 --> 03:52.985
- Over there with Nicole. 
- Oh, looks like a serious talk.

03:53.088 --> 03:54.772
And there have been zero light moments.

03:55.023 --> 03:56.697
I wish I knew what they were talking about.

03:57.036 --> 03:58.155
Oh, I can tell you what they're saying.

03:58.315 --> 03:58.662
How?

03:59.466 --> 04:01.499
I read lips. My girlfriend taught me.

04:01.730 --> 04:04.674
It's so we can have quiet time and keep the conversation going at the same time.

04:05.529 --> 04:09.692
Okay, she just said, "Hardwood sponge is the authority of the hostile biographer."

04:09.823 --> 04:13.203
And then he responded, "Just phone cords to original samovars."

04:13.592 --> 04:14.776
Kirk, that doesn't make any sense.

04:15.015 --> 04:17.315
Must mean they're on to us and they've switched to some sort of code.

04:17.591 --> 04:18.877
I don't think they're speaking in code.

04:19.112 --> 04:20.817
Oh, I think Luke's heading back.

04:20.914 --> 04:22.487
He just got up and said, "Feel your taters."

04:22.922 --> 04:24.888
Is it possible he said, "I'll see you later?"

04:25.390 --> 04:26.720
No, I'm pretty sure about this one.

04:26.956 --> 04:29.255
Kirk, I'm so sorry, we accidentally made the eggs in the fish pan.

04:29.399 --> 04:30.089
Here's new eggs.

04:30.351 --> 04:32.507
I don't know why everybody in this town always thinks I'm crazy.

04:35.072 --> 04:35.767
You've got to be kidding.

04:35.910 --> 04:37.939
I certainly am not kidding. This is serious.

04:38.149 --> 04:39.823
- It's not plagiarism. 
- Hey!

04:41.866 --> 04:43.882
Do you also like to shout "fire" in a crowded theater?

04:43.971 --> 04:46.084
This is a newsroom. Do not use the "p" word.

04:46.193 --> 04:48.040
Every single word in my piece was written by me.

04:48.158 --> 04:48.696
Was it?

04:48.993 --> 04:51.307
Look at this. "Small band of followers."

04:51.487 --> 04:52.700
"Rain-soaked highway."

04:53.356 --> 04:54.507
I've seen both of those before.

04:54.634 --> 04:55.684
Of course you've seen them before.

04:55.889 --> 04:59.079
Those are phrases used to talk about a small band of followers or,

04:59.264 --> 05:00.647
you know, a rain-soaked highway.

05:00.743 --> 05:03.472
They're not even clichés like "shouting fire in a crowded theater."

05:03.584 --> 05:05.177
I'm sorry, can you say "Stephen Glass?"

05:05.735 --> 05:09.187
The entire climate of journalistic ethics is under a microscope right now.

05:09.366 --> 05:10.973
We can't afford anything that looks shady.

05:11.423 --> 05:13.655
I'd rather not have Tobey Maguire playing me in a movie

05:13.728 --> 05:15.541
about the Yale Daily News scandal, thank you very much.

05:15.657 --> 05:18.546
I get that, but I don't think my "rain-soaked highway" looks shady.

05:19.068 --> 05:19.636
Typical.

05:20.158 --> 05:21.577
- It's your attitude. 
- What attitude?

05:21.868 --> 05:23.051
Look around this room.

05:23.610 --> 05:25.643
People writing their anthro papers on our computers,

05:25.744 --> 05:27.731
people Xeroxing their phone bills on our copy machines.

05:27.972 --> 05:29.753
No one's running, no one's sweating.

05:29.892 --> 05:32.196
Every single person in this room looks extremely well-rested.

05:32.405 --> 05:34.234
No one spell-checks. No one fact-checks.

05:34.597 --> 05:36.733
This is the breeding ground for the next Jayson Blair!

05:37.485 --> 05:39.384
Fix it. And tidy up your desk!

05:39.871 --> 05:41.796
- And my month is up. 
- What?

05:41.934 --> 05:43.286
You're the new dog to kick around here.

05:43.454 --> 05:45.175
I feel bad, 'cause you tend to be a pretty decent person,

05:45.273 --> 05:47.894
but my nose has been whacked with a newspaper so many times this month,

05:47.966 --> 05:49.093
it almost makes me miss my mother.

05:49.204 --> 05:50.582
Doyle's just in a bad mood, that's all.

05:50.716 --> 05:53.249
"Herd mentality?" Are you freaking kidding me?!

05:54.206 --> 05:55.927
Welcome to the dollhouse.

05:57.073 --> 05:59.138
Michel, come on, we've got to get into these budgets.

05:59.281 --> 05:59.834
Now.

06:00.074 --> 06:02.021
Does the red light mean it's programmed?

06:02.240 --> 06:03.613
I explained it a hundred times.

06:03.785 --> 06:06.019
Michel, you've been setting that machine for 20 minutes now.

06:06.156 --> 06:07.770
The man can't live without his dog show.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.402
I could just kill my cable provider.

06:10.694 --> 06:12.746
"No Westminster dog show, but please enjoy

06:12.835 --> 06:15.531
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle 24 hours a day."

06:15.875 --> 06:19.316
- Ah, there, it's recording. 
- Well, get over here.

06:19.398 --> 06:20.611
I just want to see the Chows.

06:20.765 --> 06:24.333
Look at that one strut.

06:24.620 --> 06:26.776
You know you're a pretty girl, don't you?

06:26.981 --> 06:29.961
Yes, with those "I need some loving" eyes.

06:30.154 --> 06:31.091
Is he doing tricks?

06:31.292 --> 06:32.423
It sounds like they're turning them.

06:33.375 --> 06:34.835
- Hello. 
- Lorelai, it's me.

06:34.927 --> 06:36.719
- Do you have a moment? 
- Sure.

06:36.826 --> 06:38.547
Your grandmother. She's gone.

06:38.658 --> 06:39.852
- What? 
- Last night.

06:39.995 --> 06:42.377
She apparently had a heart attack. The maid found her in the morning.

06:42.499 --> 06:44.553
But I didn't even know her heart was a thing.

06:44.711 --> 06:46.395
Was her heart a thing? Did we know that?

06:46.498 --> 06:49.544
No, it was quite unexpected. There wasn't any warning at all.

06:50.123 --> 06:51.552
But we just saw her.

06:51.700 --> 06:52.935
I know. It's a complete shock.

06:53.067 --> 06:55.576
Ohh. I... How is Dad?

06:55.729 --> 06:57.235
He's completely fallen apart.

06:57.358 --> 06:59.759
From the moment he heard the news, he's been almost incoherent.

06:59.883 --> 07:00.782
Oh, no.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.816
He's in his office now with the Scotch,

07:02.903 --> 07:05.611
and he wants turtleneck soup -- asks for it over and over.

07:05.631 --> 07:07.175
What's turtleneck soup?

07:07.275 --> 07:09.778
Apparently something his mother used to have made for him

07:09.861 --> 07:11.843
when he was a little boy, and now he wants some,

07:12.001 --> 07:15.140
and I can't seem to find anybody who has any idea what it is.

07:15.258 --> 07:17.914
All right, the pugs are up next. They're ugly. Let's do this.

07:18.349 --> 07:21.108
- My grandmother. 
- Heart attack -- grandmother.

07:21.207 --> 07:21.704
What?

07:21.999 --> 07:23.500
Dead grandmother, Michel.

07:23.901 --> 07:25.543
Mom, have you looked on the internet?

07:25.692 --> 07:26.855
- For what? 
- For turtleneck soup.

07:26.936 --> 07:29.204
- You could Google it. 
- Can I? Can I Google it?

07:29.312 --> 07:30.351
Okay, never mind.

07:30.505 --> 07:32.297
Sookie, do you have any idea what turtleneck soup could be?

07:32.430 --> 07:33.495
You mean mock turtle soup?

07:33.645 --> 07:35.092
Mom, do you think he means "mock turtle soup?"

07:35.267 --> 07:36.367
Maybe that's what he said.

07:36.639 --> 07:38.164
- Is there such a thing? 
- I think so.

07:38.282 --> 07:39.255
Can you make mock turtle soup?

07:39.440 --> 07:42.219
I never tried, but I think I have a recipe for it somewhere here.

07:42.368 --> 07:45.441
So, Mom, Sookie's tracking down the soup. What else can I do?

07:45.574 --> 07:47.555
Nothing. If you can find the soup, that'll be enough.

07:47.733 --> 07:49.458
- You'll tell Rory? 
- Yeah, I'll tell Rory.

07:49.633 --> 07:50.693
All right, I have to go.

07:50.857 --> 07:53.166
Your grandmother left very specific instructions

07:53.248 --> 07:55.383
on exactly how she wants her funeral to be,

07:55.506 --> 07:56.894
so I have a hundred things to do.

07:57.006 --> 07:58.583
I'll be there with the soup as soon as I can, Mom.

07:58.695 --> 07:59.904
- All right, bye. 
- Bye.

08:01.128 --> 08:02.014
I'm gonna have to go.

08:02.496 --> 08:04.933
No problem. One huge vat of mock turtle soup coming up.

08:05.255 --> 08:06.627
Do you need a hug?

08:07.047 --> 08:09.070
Thanks, I'm okay. I have to call Rory.

08:09.228 --> 08:10.902
- You'll call me when the soup's ready? 
- I'm on it.

08:11.886 --> 08:12.884
Have to go.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.166
Michel, you'll take care of the papers and the landscaping plans?

08:16.278 --> 08:17.343
Yes, I will. Go, go.

08:17.614 --> 08:20.129
Okay. Purse, coat, keys. I'm gone.

08:20.630 --> 08:21.527
- Michel? 
- Yes?

08:22.396 --> 08:23.641
I think I'll take that hug now.

08:29.585 --> 08:31.573
- A little weird, huh? 
- Yeah, extremely.

08:31.664 --> 08:33.215
Heart in the right place, but never again?

08:33.354 --> 08:33.986
Thank God.

08:34.530 --> 08:37.604
Yes, I understand the reverend's retired. You said that four times.

08:37.736 --> 08:40.937
But my mother-in-law specifically requested him for the service, and…

08:41.936 --> 08:44.715
Well, isn't there any forwarding information?

08:45.776 --> 08:46.543
I got the soup.

08:46.875 --> 08:48.689
Well, I will hold while you look.

08:49.600 --> 08:50.798
Thank God. He's in his study.

08:50.920 --> 08:52.524
Take that into him and see if you can get him to eat.

08:53.465 --> 08:55.232
Yes, I'm still here. Miraculous, isn't it?

08:55.944 --> 08:56.849
A phone number! How…

09:00.178 --> 09:00.822
Hey, dad.

09:01.590 --> 09:02.237
Lorelai?

09:04.289 --> 09:06.946
Yeah, I have something for you.

09:07.428 --> 09:08.175
Mock turtle soup.

09:09.055 --> 09:09.847
Mock turtle soup?

09:10.357 --> 09:11.436
Yeah. Sookie made it.

09:11.739 --> 09:12.559
Mock turtle soup.

09:13.598 --> 09:14.524
Mock turtle soup.

09:15.723 --> 09:16.726
Mock turtle soup.

09:17.955 --> 09:19.055
Mock turtle soup.

09:19.402 --> 09:21.938
Oh, hey, soup's gone. No soup here.

09:22.086 --> 09:24.002
Who mentioned soup? This is definitely a no-soup zone.

09:29.475 --> 09:30.656
The music's nice.

09:31.026 --> 09:32.511
Oh, she loved Kay Kyser.

09:34.646 --> 09:36.305
She wasn't really a musical woman.

09:36.735 --> 09:38.276
Music was a little frivolous for her.

09:39.694 --> 09:42.906
- But Kay Kyser. 
- Yeah. Well, she's great.

09:43.015 --> 09:44.799
Kay Kyser's a man.

09:45.034 --> 09:47.737
Oh, well, his parents had an ugly sense of humor then.

09:51.670 --> 09:52.305
Oh, boy.

09:53.334 --> 09:56.160
She was a saint -- the woman was a saint.

09:56.718 --> 09:57.332
Here, Dad.

09:57.782 --> 09:59.415
I learned everything from that woman.

10:00.041 --> 10:01.137
"Life is a battle,

10:02.146 --> 10:03.569
and you either enter it armed

10:04.152 --> 10:05.689
or you surrender immediately."

10:06.401 --> 10:07.589
That is what she told me...

10:08.073 --> 10:09.846
on my 10th birthday. I never forgot that.

10:10.558 --> 10:12.211
No, no one...

10:14.219 --> 10:15.497
was as strong as that woman.

10:17.189 --> 10:18.207
That wonderful woman...

10:20.239 --> 10:21.556
that saint of a woman.

10:22.734 --> 10:23.715
Oh, Dad.

10:24.930 --> 10:27.126
Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine.

10:27.407 --> 10:30.756
I just have to deal with this...

10:33.275 --> 10:34.775
- regret. 
- What regret?

10:34.940 --> 10:36.518
Dad, you and Gran were so close.

10:36.649 --> 10:39.107
The last words we exchanged, we exchanged in anger.

10:39.353 --> 10:40.556
Oh, but, dad, that's...

10:41.344 --> 10:42.408
I lost my temper

10:43.408 --> 10:44.759
and I was disrespectful.

10:45.809 --> 10:48.743
And that's the way -- that's the way it ended.

10:49.904 --> 10:50.924
With an argument

10:52.173 --> 10:53.504
and hateful words.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.367
Dad, you know, that was one little fight.

10:55.460 --> 11:00.376
I mean, one little fight between you and Gran doesn't wipe away years of...

11:00.446 --> 11:03.202
That woman raised me and she taught me.

11:04.292 --> 11:07.001
And she took care of the family even after Father died.

11:07.979 --> 11:11.440
And I spoke her as if I owed her nothing,

11:11.548 --> 11:14.062
as if she was like anyone else in the world

11:14.149 --> 11:15.920
and not the saint of a woman that she was.

11:16.012 --> 11:17.011
Oh, Dad.

11:17.112 --> 11:19.381
You only have one set of parents, Lorelai.

11:19.488 --> 11:23.550
Remember that. I forgot and now I have to live with that for the rest of my life.

11:36.487 --> 11:37.651
You mentioned soup.

11:38.417 --> 11:40.117
- What? 
- When you came in.

11:40.538 --> 11:43.159
Yes, soup. I have soup.

11:44.075 --> 11:47.950
Mom mentioned that you were talking about mock turtle soup

11:48.053 --> 11:49.947
and you really should eat something, Dad.

11:50.352 --> 11:51.351
I need a spoon.

11:51.647 --> 11:53.214
Oh, my Go-- yes, I'll get you a spoon.

11:53.368 --> 11:56.108
I'll get you -- you just sit right there.

11:56.276 --> 11:57.761
I'll be right back with your spoon.

11:58.539 --> 12:00.408
But it used to be Martelli's Florist, yes?

12:00.797 --> 12:03.618
Okay, do you have any idea where Martelli's moved to?

12:04.433 --> 12:07.397
Oh, well, before he died, did Mr. Martelli pass his trade

12:07.484 --> 12:08.898
on to any of the other Martellis?

12:09.552 --> 12:10.597
Yes, I'll hold.

12:10.776 --> 12:12.103
- How is he doing? 
- He needs a spoon.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.309
- He's going to eat? 
- He's going to eat.

12:14.719 --> 12:16.475
Thank God. Take an apple.

12:16.618 --> 12:17.796
See if you can get him to eat an apple.

12:18.344 --> 12:19.020
I'm here.

12:19.854 --> 12:21.855
Yes, I will take the simple stepson's number.

12:22.686 --> 12:23.422
Thank you.

12:23.848 --> 12:25.804
I will speak slowly. Thank you.

12:26.837 --> 12:27.529
Not that one.

12:28.973 --> 12:30.038
And take some bread, too.

12:31.896 --> 12:32.910
How are the arrangements coming?

12:33.008 --> 12:34.165
Well, she made them twenty years ago,

12:34.272 --> 12:36.192
so the reverend is retired, the florist has moved,

12:36.268 --> 12:38.235
and two of the pallbearers are no longer with us.

12:38.434 --> 12:41.005
Luckily, they both had sons who look remarkably like them,

12:41.081 --> 12:42.228
so I think we can get away with it.

12:42.357 --> 12:44.072
All right, I'm gonna bring this stuff to Dad.

12:44.190 --> 12:46.084
I'm going to call the florist's idiot stepson.

12:46.539 --> 12:48.138
Emily? Emily!

12:48.372 --> 12:49.811
I'm right here, Richard. What's wrong?

12:50.374 --> 12:52.637
This is outrageous! They've completely ruined it!

12:52.740 --> 12:53.662
Who ruined what?

12:53.805 --> 12:56.610
Trix's obituary. The Courant just faxed it through.

12:56.912 --> 12:58.629
It's disgraceful! I'll sue them!

12:58.720 --> 12:59.831
Just calm down.

13:00.360 --> 13:03.379
"Lorelai Gilmore died this week at age 86.

13:03.509 --> 13:05.479
A member of the prominent Gilmore family

13:05.591 --> 13:07.112
and widow of Charles Abbott Gilmore,

13:07.230 --> 13:09.400
she is survived by a son, Richard Gilmore,

13:09.590 --> 13:12.187
and numerous other family members and devoted friends."

13:13.887 --> 13:15.555
- Well, it's...
- It's an insult!

13:16.293 --> 13:17.444
That's all they write?

13:17.747 --> 13:20.997
Nothing about her charity work or her collecting or her travels?

13:21.442 --> 13:25.529
And not a word about the new maternity wing that she donated to St. Joseph's!

13:25.728 --> 13:28.171
You tell me where all of the fine people of Hartford

13:28.258 --> 13:31.816
are supposed to have all their babies if it weren't for my mother, tell me that!

13:31.929 --> 13:34.310
All right, all right, calm down. We will take care of it.

13:34.397 --> 13:35.395
She was a saint, that woman!

13:35.544 --> 13:38.785
I know. Absolutely, we will make sure it says "saint" somewhere in the article.

13:38.882 --> 13:39.896
- You're sure? 
- I'm sure.

13:39.999 --> 13:40.694
Don't worry, Dad.

13:40.824 --> 13:42.220
Because it's very, very wrong!

13:42.455 --> 13:44.407
- Dad, I got your spoon. 
- Well, I'm not hungry.

13:46.372 --> 13:48.697
Wonderful. Yet another thing I have to take care of.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.201
Mom, why don't you let me help out a little?

13:51.289 --> 13:52.302
- That's all right. 
- I'm happy to do it.

13:52.384 --> 13:55.046
I'll bring coffee, a Danish. You've never had so much fun with death in your life.

13:55.145 --> 13:57.304
I appreciate the offer, but I have it all under control.

13:57.442 --> 13:58.670
I should probably take off then.

13:58.926 --> 14:00.530
Goodbye. Thank Sookie for me.

14:04.098 --> 14:06.622
Hello, I'm looking for Manny Martelli, please.

14:07.917 --> 14:11.092
Well, what time do you expect him back from the science-fiction convention?

14:12.019 --> 14:12.673
Yes.

14:13.673 --> 14:14.922
Would you hold on a minute, please?

14:15.260 --> 14:18.849
Lorelai, I have to go to Gran's house tomorrow to sort through her personal papers.

14:19.196 --> 14:20.533
Two cherry Danish coming up.

14:21.583 --> 14:23.503
Yes, I would like to leave a message.

14:30.052 --> 14:32.019
- Hello? 
- Hey, it's me.

14:32.192 --> 14:34.818
Nigella just made a raisin cake that looked so good,

14:34.978 --> 14:37.497
the fact that raisins make me gag became totally irrelevant.

14:37.636 --> 14:39.510
Well, good, more ordering choices.

14:39.657 --> 14:42.443
Oh, my God, she's about to deep-fry a Bounty Bar.

14:42.581 --> 14:44.496
I want to move in with her and call her Mommy. Do you mind?

14:44.665 --> 14:46.692
Honey, I have to tell you something.

14:46.817 --> 14:47.450
You sound sad.

14:47.625 --> 14:50.005
Yeah, well, Gran died.

14:50.257 --> 14:51.225
What? When?

14:51.409 --> 14:53.052
Last night. She had a heart attack.

14:54.900 --> 14:55.714
Are you okay?

14:56.088 --> 14:58.141
- How's Grandpa? 
- Well, he's been better.

14:58.290 --> 14:59.723
What should I do? Can I do something?

14:59.852 --> 15:01.505
No, it's all being taken care of.

15:01.618 --> 15:02.396
When's the funeral?

15:02.540 --> 15:05.580
Friday, and there's a wake after. I don't remember if you have a class.

15:05.919 --> 15:07.270
Doesn't matter. I'll make it work.

15:07.404 --> 15:07.936
Okay.

15:08.290 --> 15:09.575
I was just getting to know her.

15:09.738 --> 15:11.982
I think you got a pretty good snapshot.

15:12.099 --> 15:14.050
Shouldn't I be crying? I feel like I should be crying.

15:14.213 --> 15:15.755
You didn't know her that well.

15:15.861 --> 15:17.131
Still, she was my great-grandmother.

15:17.306 --> 15:19.123
I mean, I should feel more.

15:19.215 --> 15:20.817
Oh, God, what if I don't cry at the funeral?

15:20.915 --> 15:24.019
Then everyone will see that I'm not crying, and Grandpa will be upset.

15:24.110 --> 15:25.417
Well, honey, if you can't cry,

15:25.499 --> 15:29.082
at least you know you can work yourself up into a very respectable panic attack.

15:29.384 --> 15:30.413
It might have to do.

15:30.613 --> 15:31.612
You're an amazing kid.

15:32.228 --> 15:34.500
She was so lucky to have you as a great-granddaughter.

15:36.016 --> 15:39.317
Hey, do you want me to come by tonight, pick you up,

15:39.502 --> 15:41.821
take you to Tijuana, get you drunk and laid?

15:41.943 --> 15:43.608
That's okay. I've got too much work to do.

15:43.884 --> 15:44.351
Okay,

15:45.022 --> 15:47.627
well, call me if you want to talk or whatever.

15:47.965 --> 15:48.559
I will.

15:48.902 --> 15:50.585
- I love you, hon. 
- I love you, too, Mom.

15:54.724 --> 15:56.388
This looks like -- what a shock --

15:56.490 --> 15:58.016
another incoherent legal document.

15:58.190 --> 15:58.823
Hand it to me.

16:00.862 --> 16:03.474
House insurance policy."

16:03.606 --> 16:04.385
Hand it to me.

16:04.773 --> 16:07.227
You know, Mom, seriously, I can do more than just hand you stuff.

16:07.431 --> 16:08.726
That's all right. I have a system.

16:08.881 --> 16:10.872
Yes. You don't think I can work within the system,

16:11.016 --> 16:13.580
but I can! I have no plans to overthrow the system.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.285
Just teach me the system. Teach it!

16:15.481 --> 16:16.545
Just hand me some papers.

16:17.339 --> 16:18.184
Emily, excuse me.

16:18.695 --> 16:21.461
We finished cataloging the second floor, and we're about to move to the third.

16:21.609 --> 16:22.480
That's fine, Georgia.

16:22.597 --> 16:24.235
And we have bubble-wrapped those bar glasses.

16:24.322 --> 16:25.243
Where do you want us to put them?

16:25.337 --> 16:27.314
In the trunk of my car, along with the candlesticks.

16:27.380 --> 16:28.987
- My keys are in the foyer. 
- All right.

16:29.673 --> 16:32.039
- What was that about? 
- I'm preparing for the funeral.

16:32.254 --> 16:34.644
Stashing bar glasses is preparing for the funeral?

16:34.717 --> 16:36.800
Those bar glasses are supposed to stay in the family.

16:36.898 --> 16:38.111
They go to us, then to you.

16:38.316 --> 16:41.484
However, every time a certain relative of your father's comes to visit,

16:41.597 --> 16:42.816
things tend to disappear.

16:42.930 --> 16:45.311
Dad's got a Winona in the family? How cool. Who is it?

16:45.391 --> 16:46.508
His cousin Marilyn.

16:46.800 --> 16:50.430
She has been systematically pilfering those bar glasses for the last five years.

16:50.567 --> 16:51.111
Really.

16:51.264 --> 16:53.630
Plus, I saw her eyeing the candlesticks last Easter,

16:53.682 --> 16:55.120
and I'll be damned if I let her get them.

16:55.939 --> 16:56.999
So much to do.

16:57.361 --> 17:00.276
Did I tell you about the burial-slash-cremation clause?

17:00.362 --> 17:01.505
Now you're just making stuff up.

17:01.602 --> 17:03.778
Your grandmother is to have an open-casket ceremony,

17:03.871 --> 17:05.201
displayed in all her glory,

17:05.335 --> 17:08.873
then is to be cremated and have her ashes divided in two --

17:09.128 --> 17:11.278
half to be buried with her husband in the family crypt,

17:11.377 --> 17:14.294
and the other half to be put in an urn and placed on our mantelpiece.

17:14.413 --> 17:16.481
Half of Gran is going to be on your mantel forever.

17:16.571 --> 17:19.276
Staring at me, judging me, disapproving of me.

17:19.377 --> 17:20.434
So apparently, it's the top half.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.563
When I first found out, I almost had a coronary, but I've accepted it.

17:23.669 --> 17:25.701
From now on, it's going to be a 3-person household --

17:25.789 --> 17:27.115
your father, me, and her urn.

17:27.218 --> 17:29.532
You know, it's so weird. I know so little about Gran.

17:29.670 --> 17:31.462
I mean, like, what was her maiden name?

17:31.585 --> 17:32.179
Gilmore.

17:32.348 --> 17:33.925
- No, no, her maiden name. 
- Gilmore.

17:34.222 --> 17:36.279
Wait. You're not saying...

17:36.372 --> 17:37.534
She and Charles were second cousins.

17:37.683 --> 17:38.701
Ew! What?!

17:38.804 --> 17:40.473
Oh, don't act so scandalized.

17:40.596 --> 17:44.170
It was not at all uncommon for prominent families to keep the bloodlines closed.

17:44.268 --> 17:45.839
Keeping the bloodlines closed.

17:45.931 --> 17:47.729
- Is that what we're calling it? 
- Well, what would you call it?

17:47.821 --> 17:49.863
Oh, I don't know. How about "Good morning, Appalachia,

17:49.945 --> 17:51.885
I got a mighty cute sister and an extra set of toes."

17:51.983 --> 17:53.405
No one has any extra toes.

17:53.539 --> 17:54.687
I have a double-jointed thumb.

17:54.803 --> 17:57.048
Remarkable. Use it to hand me some more papers, please.

17:57.854 --> 18:01.533
I'm sorry, but I don't understand how everyone was so okay with this.

18:01.645 --> 18:02.971
I mean, what, did they just go,

18:03.093 --> 18:04.942
"What a cute couple. They look so much alike."

18:06.820 --> 18:07.486
Mom?

18:07.901 --> 18:09.006
This is to your father.

18:09.574 --> 18:12.494
It's a carbon copy of a letter she sent to your father.

18:13.422 --> 18:14.378
That's nice.

18:14.507 --> 18:16.385
My Dearest Richard, It is with heavy heart

18:16.478 --> 18:17.981
that I write you this letter tonight,

18:18.213 --> 18:21.091
but I cannot stand by and let you make a terrible mistake.

18:21.193 --> 18:22.955
Until now, I had thought, hoped, prayed

18:23.134 --> 18:25.535
that you would come to the same conclusion that I have.

18:25.878 --> 18:29.006
But you have not, and therefore, I feel it is my duty as your mother

18:29.107 --> 18:32.119
to beg you to reconsider your impending marriage.

18:32.970 --> 18:36.313
I'm sure that Emily is a very suitable woman for someone,

18:36.763 --> 18:37.873
but not for you.

18:38.054 --> 18:39.850
She will not be able to make you happy.

18:40.203 --> 18:43.010
She does not have the Gilmore stamina or spark.

18:43.147 --> 18:44.877
She is simply not a Gilmore.

18:45.012 --> 18:46.860
Well, sure, 'cause you weren't directly related to him.

18:46.962 --> 18:50.122
I don't know the circumstances surrounding your breakup with Pennilyn Lott,

18:50.326 --> 18:54.955
but it is still my belief that she is much better suited for you than Emily.

18:55.226 --> 18:58.042
I know that the timing of this is particularly awkward,

18:58.124 --> 19:00.141
since you are to be married tomorrow.

19:00.387 --> 19:01.323
No way!

19:01.493 --> 19:03.126
But your happiness is too important to me,

19:03.213 --> 19:04.570
so timing be damned.

19:04.729 --> 19:07.083
She wanted Dad to leave you at the altar.

19:07.289 --> 19:09.367
She begged him to leave me at the altar!

19:09.562 --> 19:12.092
She begged him in writing, and then she saved the carbons!

19:12.424 --> 19:13.474
Holy moly. Can I see that?

19:14.278 --> 19:15.179
I can't believe this.

19:15.875 --> 19:18.973
I'm standing here in her basement, covered in dust.

19:19.218 --> 19:22.418
I'm organizing her estate and cataloging her things.

19:22.557 --> 19:24.099
I've been on the phone for days,

19:24.194 --> 19:27.032
trying to make sure that everything was exactly the way she wanted it,

19:27.180 --> 19:30.503
and all this time, she never even wanted me in her family!

19:30.641 --> 19:32.663
Man, she sure used a lot of exclamation points.

19:32.791 --> 19:33.626
Well, fine.

19:33.902 --> 19:36.109
That's just fine, because I am done.

19:36.829 --> 19:37.630
Done?

19:37.732 --> 19:40.047
I'm done planning and running around and calling people.

19:40.144 --> 19:41.716
I'm done with anything having to do with that woman.

19:41.813 --> 19:42.448
But Dad…

19:42.597 --> 19:45.141
Skipped my best friend's funeral to golf -- that's what your dad did!

19:45.219 --> 19:46.463
Mom, we have to plan this funeral.

19:46.555 --> 19:48.044
Find a box, throw her in, we're done!

19:48.126 --> 19:48.659
Mom.

19:48.786 --> 19:51.347
Better yet, throw the old harpy's carcass in a ditch!

19:51.433 --> 19:52.591
Let a wolverine eat her.

19:52.760 --> 19:56.779
Okay, but, see, finding a wolverine near a ditch -- that takes planning.

19:56.866 --> 19:58.898
Do whatever you want! I'm going to have a drink. Would you like a drink?

19:58.976 --> 20:01.469
I can't do it, Mom! I don't know the system!

20:03.098 --> 20:05.028
- Bank info? 
- Hand it to me.

20:06.025 --> 20:07.654
I cannot believe that story.

20:07.977 --> 20:10.040
Yeah, well, trust me, the brothers Grimm

20:10.111 --> 20:11.730
were over in the corner, yelling, "No way!"

20:11.812 --> 20:13.378
- And she just walked out? 
- Yep.

20:14.059 --> 20:15.761
- Jewelry appraisal? 
- Hand it to me.

20:16.086 --> 20:17.198
Why don't you just tell me where to put it?

20:17.320 --> 20:18.463
No, because I have a system.

20:19.748 --> 20:21.479
That letter sounds awful.

20:21.591 --> 20:23.214
- It was. 
- And really cruel.

20:23.312 --> 20:26.454
So cruel -- so completely cruel that I'm kind of wondering

20:26.510 --> 20:28.149
if Gran didn't know Mom was gonna find it.

20:28.247 --> 20:29.434
Stop. It's too mean.

20:29.763 --> 20:32.189
I don't wanna think that there's that meanness in my genes.

20:32.292 --> 20:33.516
I don't wanna inherit something like that.

20:33.639 --> 20:35.809
Yeah, well, who knows what we've inherited from that woman.

20:35.992 --> 20:37.928
- Count your toes lately? 
- What are you talking about?

20:38.056 --> 20:39.890
Well, I've been saving the best for last.

20:39.996 --> 20:40.576
You're kidding.

20:40.714 --> 20:42.532
Do you know what Gran's maiden name was?

20:42.715 --> 20:43.166
What?

20:43.340 --> 20:43.998
Gilmore.

20:44.283 --> 20:46.213
Grandpa Charles was her second cousin!

20:46.310 --> 20:47.227
- No! 
- Yes.

20:47.340 --> 20:48.349
What does that mean about us?

20:48.564 --> 20:52.341
What if that's caused, like, a horrible genetic mutation

20:52.435 --> 20:53.586
that hasn't shown up yet?

20:53.749 --> 20:55.751
- Oh, our eyes! 
- What?

20:55.859 --> 20:56.803
We each have two of them.

20:56.903 --> 20:58.993
I always thought it was neat that our eyes look kind of similar,

20:59.075 --> 21:01.588
but now I don't know. Is it creepy?

21:01.681 --> 21:03.345
- I don't know. Is it ?
- I think it's creepy.

21:03.462 --> 21:04.892
Okay, just hand me some more stuff.

21:05.008 --> 21:06.288
Stop staring at my eyes. Come on.

21:06.978 --> 21:08.296
What else do you have to do?

21:08.674 --> 21:12.443
Oh, well, I haven't tracked down this Reverend Wilder yet,

21:12.535 --> 21:16.509
and I got some mysterious message from the place that made her headstone,

21:16.605 --> 21:18.895
so I have to go see about that. And then there's just the random stuff.

21:18.996 --> 21:19.893
What random stuff?

21:20.077 --> 21:22.790
Well, for instance, Gran requested

21:22.872 --> 21:24.844
that she be buried in fresh clothing.

21:24.925 --> 21:25.924
What is fresh clothing?

21:26.031 --> 21:27.137
I don't know. Clean clothing?

21:27.265 --> 21:29.917
Clothes fresh from the cleaners? New clothes?

21:30.118 --> 21:32.446
- Clothes with a mountain-fresh scent? 
- I think it's new clothing.

21:32.591 --> 21:33.722
It's safest, isn't it?

21:33.942 --> 21:36.152
So add that to the list with the headstone.

21:36.246 --> 21:38.837
Oh, and then there's the obituary. I almost forgot about the obituary.

21:38.949 --> 21:39.824
What about the obituary?

21:39.958 --> 21:42.559
The paper wrote something, but Dad thinks it's not good enough,

21:42.631 --> 21:44.341
so I have to rewrite her death announcement.

21:44.536 --> 21:45.533
I should let Mom do it.

21:45.774 --> 21:47.203
I believe it would go, "yay."

21:47.402 --> 21:48.948
Hey, can I do it? I want to help,

21:49.128 --> 21:51.319
and we have access to a database at the Yale paper

21:51.483 --> 21:52.788
that would make it really easy to research.

21:52.974 --> 21:54.977
Oh, honey, that would be great. Thank you.

21:55.104 --> 21:55.697
My pleasure.

21:56.138 --> 21:58.708
I just feel really bad for Grandpa, losing his mother.

21:59.035 --> 22:00.290
Well, they were really close.

22:00.505 --> 22:01.990
Yeah. It's sad.

22:02.864 --> 22:05.769
So, Gran and her husband had the same great-grandfather.

22:05.861 --> 22:06.648
Try not to think about it.

22:09.757 --> 22:10.638
Hello?

22:13.474 --> 22:15.246
Oh. Mom, Dad?

22:16.214 --> 22:17.021
Look at all this stuff!

22:18.216 --> 22:20.720
Mom, are you here?

22:21.560 --> 22:22.998
In the living room, Lorelai.

22:23.827 --> 22:25.926
Yeah. Where's the maid?

22:26.198 --> 22:29.187
You got a condolence moat going on out here.

22:32.578 --> 22:35.117
I told Hilda to take the day off. Nothing's happening here.

22:35.215 --> 22:37.478
I think every delivery boy in town would beg to differ.

22:37.738 --> 22:40.067
What? Oh, those. Just put those anywhere.

22:40.268 --> 22:43.263
I have to finish reading The Crimson Petal and the White for my book club.

22:44.199 --> 22:46.652
Sookie, what a pleasant surprise!

22:46.725 --> 22:47.349
What are you doing here?

22:47.467 --> 22:49.684
I brought Sookie so she could check what equipment she's going to need

22:49.744 --> 22:51.163
for the wake. And who the hell are you?!

22:51.543 --> 22:53.569
- I'm so sorry, Emily. 
- About what?

22:53.729 --> 22:55.955
Well, about Richard's mother dying.

22:56.067 --> 22:56.713
Are you?

22:58.578 --> 23:00.984
- Would you like a cigarette? 
- No, thank you.

23:01.096 --> 23:02.575
Well, then, more for me.

23:03.712 --> 23:05.678
- I think she broke. 
- Mom, what's going on?

23:05.838 --> 23:07.649
I am just gonna go to the kitchen.

23:09.569 --> 23:11.556
- Mom! 
- Lorelai, please, I'm reading.

23:12.734 --> 23:15.781
If you're going by the bar, my drink could use a little freshening up.

23:15.873 --> 23:17.087
Your drink is fresh enough!

23:17.444 --> 23:18.673
And put that cigarette out!

23:21.453 --> 23:22.257
Hi, Jason.

23:22.508 --> 23:23.690
Hey, I didn't know you were gonna be here.

23:23.907 --> 23:25.734
Oh, yeah, well, the white rabbit ran by.

23:26.036 --> 23:28.401
I chased him, fell down a hole, and here I am.

23:28.582 --> 23:29.855
So, how's everybody doing?

23:30.025 --> 23:31.709
Well, Dad's a mess,

23:31.842 --> 23:33.956
and Mom starts work at the truck stop next week.

23:34.101 --> 23:34.858
Are you holding up?

23:35.011 --> 23:36.604
Yeah, I am. Thanks for asking.

23:36.731 --> 23:38.104
Well, it's what I'm here for.

23:38.309 --> 23:39.241
- Really? 
- No.

23:39.363 --> 23:40.986
I have to get your father's signature on some papers.

23:41.852 --> 23:44.304
- Mom, where's Dad? 
- How the hell do I know?

23:44.556 --> 23:46.443
Boy, she sounds really upset.

23:46.618 --> 23:49.024
- He's probably in his study. 
- Okay, thanks.

23:50.279 --> 23:50.909
Careful.

23:58.847 --> 24:02.612
- Oh, Jason. 
- Richard, I am so sorry to hear.

24:09.504 --> 24:11.185
Who was that at the door?

24:11.332 --> 24:13.196
It was Jason. Dad needs to sign something.

24:13.346 --> 24:16.039
You know what? Why don't I start putting some of these baskets away?

24:16.160 --> 24:16.745
Whatever.

24:16.883 --> 24:19.217
And then maybe I could start writing some thank-you notes.

24:19.379 --> 24:21.374
Fine. I think there's some Post-its in the kitchen.

24:23.762 --> 24:28.398
Mom, I know how hurt you are.

24:28.916 --> 24:30.288
That letter was terrible.

24:30.391 --> 24:32.727
But there's still a lot of stuff that has to get done.

24:33.406 --> 24:34.676
I know. You're right.

24:35.469 --> 24:37.682
Say, I've got an idea.

24:38.198 --> 24:41.214
Why don't you call Pennilyn Lott and have her plan the funeral?

24:41.306 --> 24:41.736
Mom.

24:41.879 --> 24:44.004
I mean, she's the one that was supposed to be planning it anyhow,

24:44.081 --> 24:46.370
so I say let her do it. You need something, Sookie?

24:46.519 --> 24:48.603
I was just wondering if it's going to be okay

24:48.699 --> 24:50.559
to set up a buffet in the dining room.

24:50.660 --> 24:51.310
I don't know.

24:51.818 --> 24:53.286
What do you think Pennilyn Lott would do?

24:53.451 --> 24:55.062
You think she'd set it up in the dining room?

24:55.263 --> 24:58.929
Because personally, I think we should just toss some cheese cubes in the coffin,

24:59.048 --> 25:01.438
stuff some toothpicks in her mouth, and let the people go to town.

25:01.699 --> 25:03.721
- Is she serious? 
- The dining room's fine, Sookie.

25:03.830 --> 25:04.714
Okay. Good.

25:07.810 --> 25:08.760
Excuse me.

25:11.667 --> 25:12.918
Did you see that hug?

25:13.055 --> 25:14.434
Yes, I saw the hug, I saw the hug.

25:14.729 --> 25:17.700
It didn't end. It was the hug that wouldn't end,

25:17.862 --> 25:19.456
and he was wearing a robe.

25:19.562 --> 25:21.585
Yes, apparently, we're a robe family now.

25:21.703 --> 25:22.655
And he was crying.

25:22.962 --> 25:26.004
I am really, really bad at comforting people.

25:26.106 --> 25:28.089
I say completely inappropriate things --

25:28.185 --> 25:30.658
bad jokes with words like "Nantucket" in them.

25:30.746 --> 25:32.373
- Did you get what you needed? 
- Yeah, thanks.

25:32.502 --> 25:35.435
Okay. Then I guess I'll see you at the funeral tomorrow.

25:35.559 --> 25:38.010
- Yeah. About the actual funeral. 
- Jason.

25:38.149 --> 25:40.089
- I can't do funerals. 
- You have to do funerals.

25:40.172 --> 25:41.333
This was your partner's mother.

25:41.431 --> 25:43.955
I understand, but funerals have way too much emotion for me --

25:44.042 --> 25:45.798
- the death and the hugging. 
- You serious?

25:45.874 --> 25:48.010
When I was 10, my family went through a terrible period.

25:48.066 --> 25:50.918
Once a month, somebody died. For a year, they were dropping like flies.

25:51.005 --> 25:53.990
- It completely freaked me out. 
- Okay, fine, don't come,

25:54.052 --> 25:56.013
but you had better lie to my father and tell him you did.

25:56.109 --> 25:57.733
I am very comfortable with that compromise.

26:03.204 --> 26:05.449
That was Jason again. He had to go,

26:05.552 --> 26:07.338
but he wanted me to tell you hello for him.

26:07.707 --> 26:10.042
Jason. Your father loves that boy.

26:10.179 --> 26:10.951
I know he does.

26:11.188 --> 26:12.407
You know who else would love that boy?

26:12.684 --> 26:13.754
Pennilyn Lott.

26:14.168 --> 26:16.231
I'm gonna go get started on those thank-you cards.

26:16.339 --> 26:20.686
Remember to thank Pennilyn Lott just for being Pennilyn Lott.

26:23.671 --> 26:26.247
I'm almost done. I promise I'll get it to the paper this afternoon.

26:26.350 --> 26:28.192
This is a really big help, my friend. I owe you.

26:28.295 --> 26:29.768
No, it was really interesting, actually.

26:29.861 --> 26:31.611
I mean, I never knew all of these things about Gran.

26:31.787 --> 26:33.322
Really, was the extra-toe thing in there?

26:33.431 --> 26:35.663
No, but did you know that she took care of wounded soldiers

26:35.770 --> 26:37.593
that were shipped back here during World War II?

26:37.715 --> 26:41.423
She also studied at the Sorbonne and at Oxford and met three presidents.

26:41.580 --> 26:42.554
Oh. Which ones?

26:42.687 --> 26:43.798
Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon.

26:43.952 --> 26:45.842
There's this amazing picture of her frowning at Nixon

26:45.918 --> 26:47.296
like she knew he was up to something.

26:47.392 --> 26:47.919
Really?

26:48.228 --> 26:50.137
Yeah, she was some kind of something, wasn't she?

26:50.233 --> 26:51.463
Yes, she kind of was.

26:51.616 --> 26:53.629
I just love that she wanted something so...

26:54.391 --> 26:55.123
I got to go.

26:55.724 --> 26:58.626
Hi, Doyle. Hey, did you read the typo in the New York Times today?

26:59.548 --> 27:00.495
This is personal.

27:01.252 --> 27:02.645
Yes. Yes, it is.

27:02.859 --> 27:05.281
You're using newspaper resources to work on something personal,

27:05.375 --> 27:08.180
in direct defiance of what I was warning everybody about just the other day.

27:08.267 --> 27:09.706
- But this is different. 
- Oh, it is?

27:09.823 --> 27:12.261
- If I can just... 
- Oh, goody, here comes the defense.

27:12.393 --> 27:15.199
What will it be? "I'm looking something up for a friend?"

27:15.308 --> 27:16.972
"The professor didn't give me enough time?"

27:17.120 --> 27:19.781
"I was just browsing through the archives, and I got distracted?"

27:19.869 --> 27:22.070
My grandmother is dead.

27:23.027 --> 27:25.511
Oh. Oh, no.

27:25.613 --> 27:29.086
Yeah, she died two days ago, suddenly, and we were close. Okay?

27:29.177 --> 27:31.320
We were close, and I'm just trying to give her

27:31.419 --> 27:35.234
an obituary that is fitting for the great woman that she was.

27:35.379 --> 27:36.150
Oh. That's...

27:37.031 --> 27:39.264
- I didn't know. 
- You didn't ask.

27:39.427 --> 27:41.281
My grandmother died in December, and it was...

27:43.831 --> 27:44.865
I'm still not over it.

27:46.012 --> 27:47.512
I know exactly what you're going through.

27:47.783 --> 27:49.785
Keep going, please. I'm sorry.

27:50.216 --> 27:50.937
It's okay.

27:51.760 --> 27:52.647
And thank you.

27:58.879 --> 28:00.158
Last week, you know what I did?

28:00.815 --> 28:01.270
No.

28:01.438 --> 28:02.662
I picked up the phone to call her.

28:03.016 --> 28:03.790
Isn't that sad?

28:04.357 --> 28:07.066
I actually forgot, and then, of course, it hit me all over again.

28:07.460 --> 28:08.509
I hope that doesn't happen to you.

28:08.617 --> 28:09.211
Me too.

28:09.385 --> 28:10.747
She smelled a little like coffee.

28:11.044 --> 28:13.030
I still can't walk past any place that makes coffee.

28:13.435 --> 28:16.424
The girl I was dating was a barista. I had to break up with her.

28:16.522 --> 28:18.074
- We weren't that close. 
- What?

28:18.182 --> 28:20.572
And it wasn't my grandmother. It was my great-grandmother.

28:20.665 --> 28:23.081
I dropped the "great" to make the whole thing sound sadder.

28:23.214 --> 28:25.329
I don't know anything about her until today.

28:25.544 --> 28:29.895
I'm so sorry. I'm just gonna pack up and go straight to hell now.

28:30.050 --> 28:32.061
My grandmother was a very special woman.

28:32.344 --> 28:36.179
She drove me to my prom, and I'd be a poor man if I'd never known her.

28:37.806 --> 28:38.687
Finish the obituary.

28:39.231 --> 28:40.346
- What? 
- What?

28:40.632 --> 28:42.179
Everybody should get to know their grandmother.

28:42.298 --> 28:43.797
But it was her great-grandmother. Didn't you hear her?

28:44.841 --> 28:47.679
Glenn, you take Rory's piece on the new parking rules, okay?

28:48.467 --> 28:50.961
My month lasts a month. Your month lasts three days.

28:51.052 --> 28:53.162
Yes, sirree, folks, that is my life!

29:02.993 --> 29:04.543
Oh, Kirk, good, I've been...

29:05.229 --> 29:06.208
What are we listening to?

29:07.284 --> 29:08.553
- Again? 
- Yep.

29:11.988 --> 29:13.458
- Who needs to order? 
- I do.

29:13.597 --> 29:14.194
Go ahead.

29:14.666 --> 29:16.155
- I'll have a chef's salad. 
- Dressing?

29:16.268 --> 29:18.275
- Oil and vinegar on the side. 
- Crackers or roll?

29:18.383 --> 29:20.190
Get the crackers, get the crackers.

29:20.360 --> 29:21.640
- I'll have the...
- Luke!

29:21.783 --> 29:23.135
- What? 
- Are you coming back?

29:23.294 --> 29:23.970
I'm working.

29:24.101 --> 29:26.121
We were having a discussion and you just got up and left.

29:26.232 --> 29:27.268
I thought we were done.

29:27.390 --> 29:28.762
I was in the middle of the word "September."

29:28.967 --> 29:30.610
Okay, come on.

29:37.390 --> 29:38.275
Okay, go ahead.

29:38.675 --> 29:40.713
We were in the middle of a conversation!

29:40.809 --> 29:41.900
We were yelling. It was a fight.

29:41.997 --> 29:43.513
- We weren't yelling. 
- It felt like yelling.

29:43.646 --> 29:44.952
Okay, we won't yell. We'll talk.

29:45.059 --> 29:46.580
- Fine, talk. 
- Me? What about you?

29:46.687 --> 29:48.280
You're the one who wanted to talk. We're here. Let's talk.

29:48.376 --> 29:49.892
- You don't want to talk? 
- I don't have anything to say.

29:52.688 --> 29:54.490
Yeah. Me either.

30:00.006 --> 30:01.208
Nicole.

30:01.940 --> 30:02.596
What?

30:03.005 --> 30:03.973
You going back to our place?

30:04.429 --> 30:04.976
Our place?

30:07.301 --> 30:07.972
Our place.

30:10.142 --> 30:10.748
Funny.

30:25.837 --> 30:28.324
Dad, why are you answering the door?

30:28.593 --> 30:30.721
Well, I heard it ring, so...

30:31.085 --> 30:32.917
The maid's taking the day off again?

30:33.107 --> 30:34.325
Yeah, I suppose so.

30:34.909 --> 30:36.492
Rory, it's nice to see you.

30:36.683 --> 30:38.262
I'm so sorry, Grandpa.

30:38.344 --> 30:39.433
Thank you, Rory.

30:39.643 --> 30:40.480
How are you?

30:40.686 --> 30:43.555
Well, I'm having a devil of a time with this tie.

30:44.001 --> 30:45.671
And you're not wearing any shoes.

30:45.890 --> 30:47.903
What? Oh, yeah, shoes.

30:48.189 --> 30:49.975
Dad, can't Mom help you with the tie?

30:50.165 --> 30:51.246
Yes. Yes.

30:51.426 --> 30:54.298
I don't know where she's gotten to.

30:55.584 --> 30:56.934
There are a lot of plans to make.

30:57.600 --> 31:00.687
Oh, someone sent us four hams. Can you imagine?

31:00.989 --> 31:02.045
Four hams.

31:02.311 --> 31:03.274
Mom, there you are.

31:03.432 --> 31:05.829
Rory, you look very nice.

31:05.952 --> 31:07.195
I brought a dress to change into.

31:07.312 --> 31:08.351
Oh, what you're wearing is fine.

31:08.634 --> 31:11.834
Lorelai, here, I just finished reading, and I think you'll really like it.

31:11.968 --> 31:14.567
It's about this prostitute named Sugar in Victorian England.

31:14.763 --> 31:16.616
She starts rising through the ranks of society,

31:16.725 --> 31:18.987
and she meets these really vivid characters!

31:19.099 --> 31:20.872
Okay, sure, you don't have to tell me the whole story now.

31:20.958 --> 31:22.785
I'm not giving anything away. That's all on the back cover.

31:22.929 --> 31:24.736
Dad? Follow him. Point out doors and windows.

31:24.854 --> 31:25.350
Got it.

31:25.704 --> 31:29.023
So, Mom, you might want to go get ready now.

31:29.109 --> 31:31.198
Nonsense! We have hours. Want a drink?

31:31.367 --> 31:33.432
Today I learned how to make mojitos!

31:33.651 --> 31:36.616
Mom, today especially, you might want to be early,

31:36.692 --> 31:37.998
since we're the ones throwing the funeral.

31:38.111 --> 31:38.838
Fine.

31:38.961 --> 31:40.195
There you go. Go on upstairs.

31:40.507 --> 31:42.325
Put on a dress -- a black dress.

31:42.515 --> 31:43.882
I got him to sit down.

31:44.035 --> 31:45.310
Okay, pillow. Soft. Good.

31:45.443 --> 31:46.646
You're right, they're a little nutty.

31:46.729 --> 31:47.973
Oh, yeah. With extra nuts on top.

31:48.336 --> 31:52.600
Okay, I have to check and make sure that Sookie's kitchen stuff made it over here.

31:52.683 --> 31:55.289
And I have to call the airline and make sure the reverend got on the plane.

31:55.370 --> 31:56.522
I have to check in with the headstone...

31:56.682 --> 31:59.314
- Underwear. 
- That took a turn.

31:59.421 --> 32:00.444
Oh, my God.

32:00.777 --> 32:04.262
I delivered Gran's clothes to the funeral home,

32:04.388 --> 32:06.814
but I forgot to include underwear.

32:07.157 --> 32:08.227
Gran's going commando?

32:08.417 --> 32:10.602
Oh, no. I'll have to go buy some.

32:11.350 --> 32:13.646
Well, wait a minute. Who's gonna know?

32:13.803 --> 32:15.312
I'll know. Just stay here.

32:15.442 --> 32:16.936
Keep an eye on your grandpa. I'll be right back.

32:25.584 --> 32:27.939
This whole section is our 2-for-1 sale.

32:28.498 --> 32:29.777
- Listen... 
- Shannon.

32:29.932 --> 32:32.895
Shannon, I need to buy something for my grandmother.

32:33.095 --> 32:34.027
Any particular style?

32:34.208 --> 32:36.561
Something respectable, upstanding.

32:36.864 --> 32:38.323
You got anything that came over on the Mayflower?

32:38.445 --> 32:41.394
We have this whole line of really terrific panties,

32:41.492 --> 32:44.943
and they have a built-in tummy panel that older women really love.

32:45.060 --> 32:46.668
Oh, well, tummy panel sounds great.

32:46.765 --> 32:47.908
- What size is she? 
- Size?

32:48.554 --> 32:50.842
She's tiny but strong.

32:51.107 --> 32:52.850
She looks like she could take a punch.

32:53.474 --> 32:57.871
But she wears these big dresses, so who knows what's going on under there.

32:57.995 --> 32:58.972
Okay, well...

32:59.152 --> 33:01.205
I'm sorry, she wore big dresses.

33:01.332 --> 33:04.211
She wore big dresses, 'cause she's dead.

33:05.034 --> 33:07.000
Do you have any idea what "fresh clothing" means?

33:07.169 --> 33:08.465
- No. 
- Neither do I.

33:08.583 --> 33:11.497
I'm guessing it means "new," and that's why I'm here,

33:11.608 --> 33:14.092
because I have to do all the planning now,

33:14.250 --> 33:15.853
because my mother found the note.

33:16.314 --> 33:21.511
The stupid note. Who writes a note like that and keeps the carbon?

33:22.084 --> 33:24.357
- I don't... 
- Yeah, my grandmother -- that's who.

33:24.485 --> 33:26.375
My grandmother, who wants fresh clothing

33:26.544 --> 33:28.202
and a 4,000-year-old minister,

33:28.331 --> 33:31.105
who wants to be cremated

33:31.208 --> 33:34.393
and put in a jar on top of my mother's mantelpiece

33:34.521 --> 33:36.446
to sit up there and judge for all eternity.

33:36.753 --> 33:39.907
I bet your family's looking really great to you right about now, huh?

33:39.989 --> 33:41.597
- Yes, they are. 
- Yeah.

33:42.523 --> 33:43.603
Oh, God.

33:44.694 --> 33:49.128
I'm just babbling. I'm standing in underwire heaven just babbling

33:49.230 --> 33:50.388
like a crazy person.

33:51.325 --> 33:53.321
I should just pick something, because,

33:53.562 --> 33:56.317
I mean, what difference does it make? She's dead.

33:56.507 --> 33:58.836
You know, the woman is dead.

33:59.010 --> 34:03.156
She can't tell what she's wearing or who bought it for her.

34:03.291 --> 34:06.158
She can't see the mess she's left behind, so...

34:07.628 --> 34:09.675
I'll just... I'll take this.

34:09.982 --> 34:11.846
- That's a small. 
- Hello! She's dead!

34:11.958 --> 34:14.534
The woman is dead! She can't tell if it's the right size!

34:14.831 --> 34:17.882
She wanted fresh clothes, and I'm here buying her fresh clothes.

34:18.010 --> 34:20.463
So if she has a problem with the size or the strawberry print,

34:20.565 --> 34:22.822
then she can rise from the dead and come back here

34:22.911 --> 34:24.877
and yell at me herself. Because you know what,

34:24.964 --> 34:30.170
if anyone could, that tough, old, crazy, wonderful broad would be the one!

34:30.862 --> 34:32.674
You take Visa, right?

34:35.295 --> 34:38.514
Okay, so, according to this, we're almost home.

34:38.844 --> 34:41.772
I just pull this through there, which looks promising,

34:41.920 --> 34:45.081
and we're done. Now you just do the final adjusting.

34:45.648 --> 34:46.591
Well, that's not bad.

34:46.867 --> 34:47.998
Fourth time's the charm.

34:48.268 --> 34:50.231
Very handy little sheet you've got there. Where'd you get it?

34:50.373 --> 34:51.926
Off the internet. You can find anything there.

34:52.871 --> 34:53.645
Very nice.

34:54.655 --> 34:55.560
Do you want to keep it...

34:55.945 --> 34:58.310
the diagram? I don't think I'll be needing it much around the dorm

34:58.556 --> 35:01.310
Well, in that case, I will.

35:01.490 --> 35:02.237
Thank you, Rory.

35:02.622 --> 35:04.485
Now I think all we need is your jacket

35:04.624 --> 35:05.918
and your shoes, and you're ready.

35:06.918 --> 35:08.058
Yes, I suppose so.

35:10.410 --> 35:13.282
You know, the suit I wore when we buried my father...

35:13.608 --> 35:15.508
I was never able to wear it again.

35:16.767 --> 35:18.329
It was brand-new -- a very nice suit.

35:18.979 --> 35:21.924
Custom-made. It was my first custom-made suit.

35:22.778 --> 35:25.001
I told your grandmother that it didn't fit anymore,

35:25.124 --> 35:26.772
but really, I just didn't want to see it again.

35:28.750 --> 35:31.878
And I suppose this is going to be it for this suit, too.

35:33.654 --> 35:36.495
So, I hear you're doing the eulogy.

35:37.437 --> 35:38.422
Well, I'm her son.

35:38.727 --> 35:40.571
Are you gonna be okay doing that?

35:40.816 --> 35:42.235
Well, I'll have to be, I suppose.

35:42.543 --> 35:44.550
Because if you find yourself feeling,

35:44.815 --> 35:47.534
you know, unsteady about it, I can do it.

35:47.739 --> 35:49.931
I did a lot of reading about Gran for the obituary,

35:50.074 --> 35:51.508
and I think I can do her justice.

35:51.625 --> 35:53.126
She had a life, didn't she?

35:53.233 --> 35:54.067
She really did.

35:54.395 --> 35:56.561
Well, I thank you for your offer,

35:56.745 --> 36:01.205
but this is my responsibility. I will be fine.

36:01.511 --> 36:02.403
I'm sure you will.

36:02.818 --> 36:06.470
However, if something happens, and I find myself, let us say,

36:06.791 --> 36:08.772
a tad more emotional than I would like -

36:08.906 --> 36:10.037
I got your back, Grandpa.

36:17.824 --> 36:20.891
Did you go shopping? I've been sitting here waiting for you.

36:25.377 --> 36:27.799
Thank you. Thanks so much for coming. Appreciate it.

36:28.019 --> 36:29.677
Nice job with the eulogy, Gilmore.

36:29.965 --> 36:33.088
Well, I've always found that a well-tied bow tie

36:33.165 --> 36:34.618
can have a very steadying effect.

36:35.437 --> 36:37.163
Richard, she was a hell of a lady.

36:37.490 --> 36:40.205
I don't know what the hospital board will do without her.

36:40.470 --> 36:42.190
I appreciate both of you coming.

36:42.627 --> 36:44.049
Have you met my granddaughter Rory?

36:44.198 --> 36:45.371
No, I don't believe we have.

36:45.462 --> 36:46.431
Nice to meet you, Rory.

36:46.537 --> 36:47.327
Nice to meet you, too.

36:47.670 --> 36:49.628
I'm gonna go get a soda. Excuse me.

36:49.963 --> 36:51.034
She's lovely, Richard.

36:51.392 --> 36:52.508
Inside and out.

36:52.918 --> 36:53.935
How's he doing?

36:54.290 --> 36:56.097
Not bad. He's holding it together --

36:56.245 --> 36:59.189
partly because all these people are here, but I think he's doing better.

36:59.347 --> 36:59.942
Good.

37:00.597 --> 37:03.736
So, what did you think of Gran's fabulous, fresh clothing?

37:03.961 --> 37:05.937
I thought it was very sophisticated.

37:06.311 --> 37:07.161
Thank you.

37:07.519 --> 37:08.538
But don't think, for a second,

37:08.637 --> 37:10.639
that I didn't notice the Hello Kitty bracelet you put on her.

37:10.818 --> 37:13.771
I just thought, a little something special from me and you for all eternity.

37:13.863 --> 37:17.290
So, there she was, dragging poor Charles around Egypt,

37:17.381 --> 37:20.459
of all places. I mean, the man detested sand.

37:20.560 --> 37:24.226
So, of course, Lorelai wanted to go and see the pyramids right away.

37:24.344 --> 37:27.324
He was dragging his feet. He wanted to go to the hotel.

37:27.498 --> 37:31.276
He said, "Lorelai, those pyramids have been there for thousands of years,

37:31.358 --> 37:33.519
so they can wait another day." And she said,

37:33.985 --> 37:37.073
"Well, you didn't marry the pyramids. You married me,

37:37.170 --> 37:39.121
and I won't wait another hour."

37:39.259 --> 37:41.578
And she jumped on a camel and rode away.

37:41.737 --> 37:44.538
Dragged the camel's owner behind her for over a mile.

37:44.686 --> 37:45.947
Man almost died.

37:47.134 --> 37:50.969
There she is. Lorelai, come here

37:51.066 --> 37:53.616
and say hello to your father's favorite cousin.

37:53.919 --> 37:54.886
Hi, Marilyn.

37:55.096 --> 37:58.092
Look at you. You look just like your picture.

37:58.337 --> 38:01.881
You know, your grandmother had this picture of you right smack-dab

38:01.957 --> 38:04.660
in the middle of her entryway. You would walk in the door,

38:04.808 --> 38:06.564
she would point to the picture, and she would say,

38:06.692 --> 38:09.687
"This is my granddaughter, Lorelai. She's not married."

38:09.790 --> 38:11.121
Oh, that's a terrific story.

38:11.263 --> 38:12.611
You are stunning!

38:12.929 --> 38:15.933
My god, tell me you're an idiot, I beg you.

38:16.117 --> 38:17.551
I have my moments. How's that?

38:17.670 --> 38:18.792
And you, miss.

38:19.032 --> 38:21.930
Am I possibly related to you also?

38:22.098 --> 38:23.788
Yes, this is my daughter Rory.

38:23.942 --> 38:26.210
It is a thrill to meet you both.

38:26.773 --> 38:28.555
Horrible circumstances, I suppose.

38:28.765 --> 38:33.885
Anyway angels, tell me: when you were last over at your grandmother's house,

38:33.967 --> 38:37.104
did you possibly notice some darling little bar glasses?

38:37.301 --> 38:38.129
Bar glasses?

38:38.263 --> 38:40.823
Crystal, with this little gold-leaf pattern around?

38:40.910 --> 38:42.133
No, I don't think so.

38:42.434 --> 38:44.443
Oh, well, I was just wondering.

38:44.564 --> 38:47.008
They weren't valuable, just sentimental.

38:47.167 --> 38:49.540
I used to admire them as a small child.

38:49.660 --> 38:52.691
Well, sure, what little kid doesn't have a fascination with bar glasses?

38:52.830 --> 38:55.077
- Well, if you ever do see them... 
- Yes, I'll let you know.

38:55.368 --> 38:58.440
I'm sorry, I have to go check the caterer.

38:58.579 --> 38:59.179
Go, go, go.

38:59.926 --> 39:02.337
- I can visit with Rory. 
- Okay.

39:02.614 --> 39:05.031
Hey, I heard you talking about Gran in Egypt.

39:05.158 --> 39:07.299
Oh, she loved Egypt.

39:07.488 --> 39:09.896
Actually, she loved anyplace exotic.

39:10.032 --> 39:13.985
Did she ever tell you about the time she was stranded in Istanbul?

39:14.215 --> 39:16.846
No. Well, I actually didn't know her very well.

39:16.995 --> 39:18.809
Oh, that's a terrible shame.

39:18.951 --> 39:20.145
I think so, too.

39:20.441 --> 39:22.500
It was a lovely service. You did a wonderful job.

39:22.884 --> 39:23.564
Thank you.

39:23.852 --> 39:25.951
It seems like we're hitting that age, now aren't we,

39:26.039 --> 39:27.938
where we're going to be going to a lot of these things.

39:28.065 --> 39:30.211
Time to invest in a second black suit, I suppose.

39:30.354 --> 39:32.637
Excuse me, please bring my husband a Manhattan,

39:32.729 --> 39:34.788
and make sure the hors d'oeuvres start with him. He has to eat something.

39:36.191 --> 39:39.180
Yeah, I think philosophy may be one of my favorite subjects right now.

39:39.529 --> 39:41.023
- Second cousin. 
- Got to go.

39:41.535 --> 39:42.406
Wait, I'll come with you.

39:43.596 --> 39:45.381
Reverend Wilder, hi.

39:45.514 --> 39:49.395
Thank you so much for coming all the way up here from Florida to be with us.

39:49.549 --> 39:51.116
Gran would have been so pleased.

39:51.264 --> 39:54.234
Oh, thank you. I was happy to do it.

39:54.387 --> 39:57.056
- And you are? 
- I'm Lorelai Gilmore.

39:57.295 --> 39:59.027
Didn't I just bury you?

39:59.154 --> 40:01.950
No, Reverend, I'm the one who talked to you on the phone,

40:02.057 --> 40:03.302
and I picked you up from the airport.

40:03.440 --> 40:04.833
- Oh, really? 
- Yeah.

40:04.955 --> 40:06.517
That was a different Lorelai.

40:06.660 --> 40:10.352
This is her granddaughter. This is the reigning Lorelai.

40:10.543 --> 40:11.586
Oh, how nice.

40:11.965 --> 40:13.269
And who are you?

40:13.418 --> 40:15.324
This is Gran's niece, Marilyn.

40:15.575 --> 40:17.879
You remember me from when I was younger.

40:17.940 --> 40:20.315
You married me to my first husband, Theodore.

40:20.429 --> 40:21.089
I did?

40:21.226 --> 40:24.606
It would be easier on all of us if you can just pretend to remember.

40:24.714 --> 40:27.658
Oh, well, that's probably a good idea.

40:37.540 --> 40:38.461
How are you holding up?

40:39.671 --> 40:41.006
My feet are killing me.

40:41.972 --> 40:43.034
How's the rest of you?

40:43.771 --> 40:46.623
The rest of me? The rest of me is fine.

40:48.512 --> 40:50.048
Oh, you know, Mom,

40:50.144 --> 40:52.670
she may have written that letter, but he picked you.

40:54.846 --> 40:57.139
I can't believe you wore those shoes to a funeral.

40:59.555 --> 41:01.210
I'm going to go get a stuffed mushroom now.

41:10.416 --> 41:11.751
Your tie is crooked.

41:12.381 --> 41:14.490
- Have you eaten? 
- Oh, yes.

41:15.202 --> 41:17.040
Every five minutes, it seems a young man

41:17.122 --> 41:19.185
would show up at my side with a tray of food.

41:19.278 --> 41:21.024
- Your doing, I suppose. 
- Could be.

41:21.361 --> 41:22.821
There, that's better.

41:23.093 --> 41:24.956
So, I've been thinking.

41:25.187 --> 41:25.853
Yes?

41:26.534 --> 41:30.241
I'm not so sure the mantel is the best place for Gran's ashes.

41:30.435 --> 41:31.060
What?

41:31.223 --> 41:33.359
The ledge is too small. It wouldn't really be appropriate.

41:33.476 --> 41:34.167
But her wishes.

41:34.285 --> 41:35.760
Being buried with my father...

41:36.012 --> 41:39.225
seems right. Don't you agree?

41:41.063 --> 41:42.579
Whatever you want, Richard.

41:44.929 --> 41:47.203
So, there she is, Aunt Lorelai,

41:47.325 --> 41:49.656
already in her 70s, mind you,

41:49.819 --> 41:53.256
and the blizzard has her trapped in that old house for a week

41:53.414 --> 41:55.713
with no heat, no running water.

41:56.107 --> 41:59.313
The local police finally came and dug her out

41:59.481 --> 42:02.758
and handed her some hot tea. And you know what she does?

42:03.081 --> 42:05.762
First of all, she complains that the tea is too hot,

42:05.932 --> 42:08.979
and then she sends them a bill for carpet cleaning,

42:09.055 --> 42:10.669
because they tracked in snow.

42:11.109 --> 42:12.174
So, you ditched the cousin?

42:12.428 --> 42:14.755
Yeah, we ran into a sister, and how could I compete?

42:14.891 --> 42:15.583
Oh, sure.

42:16.168 --> 42:16.879
How are you doing?

42:17.038 --> 42:18.282
I'm feeling sadder about Gran,

42:18.414 --> 42:21.795
but feeling sadder is making me feel less guilty about not feeling sad,

42:21.885 --> 42:23.392
- so things are looking up. 
- Good.

42:23.852 --> 42:26.449
So, apparently, I am now the reigning Lorelai.

42:26.618 --> 42:28.291
I guess you are.

42:28.523 --> 42:30.601
- It's a lot of responsibility. 
- Well, sure.

42:30.698 --> 42:32.720
It's mostly ceremonial stuff nowadays --

42:32.798 --> 42:34.477
declaring knighthoods, opening supermarkets --

42:34.590 --> 42:37.179
but now and then, you get to banish someone or pose for a stamp.

42:37.339 --> 42:38.424
Neat. And coins.

42:38.557 --> 42:39.408
Yeah and coins.

42:39.622 --> 42:41.301
You know, someday you'll be the reigning Lorelai.

42:41.425 --> 42:42.423
I don't like that idea.

42:42.623 --> 42:43.682
Why not? You get a cape.

42:43.795 --> 42:46.549
Because if I'm the reigning Lorelai, that means you'll be gone.

42:46.663 --> 42:48.567
Gone? No, not me.

42:48.719 --> 42:50.225
I'll step down way before that.

42:50.318 --> 42:52.970
I'm not gonna pull a Queen Elizabeth on you, make you wait around forever,

42:53.056 --> 42:55.775
force you to develop interests in polo and architecture.

42:55.874 --> 42:57.670
- I am scared of horses. 
- I know that.

42:59.119 --> 43:00.328
So, there's a cape, huh?
