00:00.238 --> 00:01.672
<i>Previously on The Borgias...</i>

00:01.923 --> 00:03.991
<i>The Jews from Constantinople.</i>

00:03.992 --> 00:05.358
<i>More of them come every day.</i>

00:05.426 --> 00:07.293
You were driven
out by the Turks.

00:07.361 --> 00:08.628
We offer you a home,

00:08.695 --> 00:09.894
<i>a place to prosper.</i>

00:09.962 --> 00:11.629
And in return?

00:11.697 --> 00:13.430
<i>So the King</i>
<i>of Naples died.</i>

00:13.498 --> 00:14.964
<i>Most horribly.</i>

00:15.032 --> 00:16.165
<i>There are several</i>
<i>claimants, I've heard.</i>

00:16.233 --> 00:17.498
<i>Is your Alfonso</i>
<i>among them?</i>

00:17.566 --> 00:19.465
There are two in
line in front of him.

00:19.533 --> 00:20.799
Your Highness.

00:20.866 --> 00:22.900
The last French invasion
ended in disaster.

00:22.968 --> 00:25.769
Maybe if the next was under
Italian leadership...

00:25.836 --> 00:28.271
King Louis
of France invades our shores

00:28.339 --> 00:29.739
without our permission!

00:29.807 --> 00:31.073
He has our permission.

00:31.141 --> 00:32.876
You would bring an
army into our land.

00:32.943 --> 00:35.178
I would eliminate
the Sforza dynasty.

00:35.246 --> 00:36.813
Ludovico first.

00:36.881 --> 00:38.081
<i>What is this?</i>

00:38.149 --> 00:40.084
A message from Lady
Catherina Sforza

00:40.151 --> 00:41.552
treating for peace.

00:41.619 --> 00:43.320
This is a bluff.
Burn it.

00:43.388 --> 00:45.189
Catherina Sforza
has no more interest

00:45.257 --> 00:46.757
<i>in suing for peace</i>
<i>than I do.</i>

00:46.825 --> 00:49.394
Are you sick?
What's the matter?

00:49.495 --> 00:51.029
Plague!

00:51.097 --> 00:53.265
<i>This king</i>
<i>desires more than Naples.</i>

00:53.332 --> 00:55.667
He has an equal
fondness for Milan.

00:58.404 --> 00:59.504
<i>My Lord Sforza?</i>

00:59.572 --> 01:01.005
<i>My mother was right.</i>

01:01.072 --> 01:02.373
<i>Come tomorrow's dawn there</i>
<i>will be rivers of blood.</i>

01:02.440 --> 01:04.040
The gates are open, my lord.

01:04.141 --> 01:05.542
The city looks unguarded.

01:05.609 --> 01:06.676
Welcome to Milan.

01:06.744 --> 01:08.478
Where's Ludovico Sforza?
Gone.

01:08.545 --> 01:09.906
<i>We have Milan, my lord.</i>

01:09.946 --> 01:11.480
No, the French have Milan.

01:11.548 --> 01:13.848
<i>And Ludovico Sforza lives</i>
<i>to fight another day.</i>

01:13.916 --> 01:15.116
DAMN HIM!

03:07.591 --> 03:09.326
How do you know this place?

03:09.393 --> 03:11.328
I know Milan very well.

03:11.395 --> 03:15.598
I know a boy who knows a boy
whom Leonardo painted...

03:15.666 --> 03:18.268
You understand me?

03:38.190 --> 03:40.458
Who was this boy
you spoke of?

03:40.526 --> 03:42.994
We called him
Il Saliano.

03:43.062 --> 03:44.796
The Little Devil.

03:44.864 --> 03:46.865
Yes, he's that
and more.

03:46.933 --> 03:49.634
But Leonardo
loves him dearly.

03:49.735 --> 03:51.736
Leonardo loves devils?

03:51.837 --> 03:54.439
Mm-hmm.

03:54.507 --> 03:57.910
The more he steals from him,
the more he lies to him,

03:58.011 --> 04:00.278
the more Leonardo loves him.

04:03.015 --> 04:04.549
Why?

04:04.617 --> 04:06.752
Why?
Mm.

04:15.931 --> 04:17.365
That's why.

04:53.904 --> 04:56.038
<i>Soldiers approaching!</i>

04:56.140 --> 04:57.306
<i>Soldiers!</i>

04:57.374 --> 04:58.741
Yah!

05:02.980 --> 05:05.348
<i>Restez en formation!</i>

05:05.416 --> 05:07.017
<i>The King of France, my lord!</i>

05:13.124 --> 05:14.224
<i>Arret!</i>

05:34.613 --> 05:35.947
Your Highness.

05:38.484 --> 05:40.752
So...

05:40.820 --> 05:42.621
Ludovico is alive.

05:42.689 --> 05:46.124
His army is intact.

05:46.192 --> 05:48.593
His army is no longer
what I call an army.

05:48.695 --> 05:50.428
It scattered.

05:50.496 --> 05:51.863
You promised me Milan.

05:51.931 --> 05:53.698
And while the Duke
Ludovico is alive,

05:53.799 --> 05:55.066
he has a claim to it.

05:55.134 --> 05:56.768
I will hunt him down.

05:56.835 --> 05:59.237
Excellent.
Do that.

05:59.304 --> 06:02.273
And when you've,
um, captured him,

06:02.341 --> 06:06.077
tell your father the pope
I hold this city in his name.

06:06.145 --> 06:08.446
His, not mine.

06:08.514 --> 06:10.448
Yet you share
the same name.

06:27.801 --> 06:29.267
What is that thing?

06:31.638 --> 06:33.372
A bird.

06:33.473 --> 06:35.074
A mechanical bird.

06:35.142 --> 06:36.943
Can it fly?

06:37.010 --> 06:39.512
Perhaps someday
it will.

06:39.580 --> 06:41.714
To what purpose?

06:41.782 --> 06:42.949
No purpose.

06:43.017 --> 06:45.051
The maestro
likes to dream.

06:53.794 --> 06:55.829
So, tell me,
where does this lead us?

06:57.364 --> 06:59.900
Us?
Nowhere.

07:02.136 --> 07:03.903
Where does this
affection go?

07:05.506 --> 07:06.973
There was
no affection.

07:10.878 --> 07:14.547
Affection leads to weakness,
and I have no use for either.

07:17.618 --> 07:19.452
What is this?

07:21.222 --> 07:23.357
<i>An arquebus.</i>

07:23.424 --> 07:25.659
Arquebus.
Hm.

07:27.361 --> 07:30.998
So he's an artist
and a condottiere?

07:31.065 --> 07:35.201
No, he designed
the sight.

07:35.269 --> 07:37.437
Hm?

07:37.505 --> 07:39.439
It has two notches.

07:39.507 --> 07:41.608
Here and here.

07:41.676 --> 07:43.544
You line them up
with the eye.

07:54.355 --> 07:55.656
Clever.

08:08.135 --> 08:14.141
Your son hopes
to capture Milan.

08:14.242 --> 08:16.309
Is he not your son too?

08:18.813 --> 08:21.114
Sometimes we wonder.

08:22.550 --> 08:24.417
I do not.

08:24.519 --> 08:26.653
And I should know.

08:29.523 --> 08:32.292
Giulia Farnese has
captured a suitor.

08:32.360 --> 08:35.227
Oh, must you, Vanozza?

08:35.296 --> 08:37.998
I must because
she asked me.

08:38.065 --> 08:39.698
She wants to
present him to you.

08:39.767 --> 08:41.701
For our approval?

08:41.769 --> 08:44.037
For your blessing.

08:45.806 --> 08:47.974
What's his name,
this suitor?

08:48.075 --> 08:49.609
Vincenzo.

08:50.911 --> 08:52.412
Terrible name.

09:11.298 --> 09:14.067
Can we be happy now?

09:14.134 --> 09:16.169
Like any family?

09:16.270 --> 09:19.238
This is not just
any family.

09:19.306 --> 09:21.640
Things have been
difficult between us,

09:21.708 --> 09:25.344
but I wanted to thank you
for your kindness.

09:25.412 --> 09:27.346
For your patience.

09:28.682 --> 09:31.417
Could kindness ever
satisfy a Borgia?

09:34.655 --> 09:38.991
All I ever wanted was to be
loved by a prince like you.

09:43.464 --> 09:45.131
Who could be king one day.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.534
Never.

09:50.337 --> 09:51.871
Don't you see, my love?

09:51.939 --> 09:54.708
It is the only way that
we can assure our safety -

09:54.775 --> 09:57.877
as a family,
with my beloved child -

09:57.945 --> 10:00.347
if you rule this kingdom...

10:00.448 --> 10:03.183
I'm the Duke of Bisceglie,

10:03.284 --> 10:06.553
which means I'm third in line
to the throne of Naples

10:06.620 --> 10:08.254
and I have two cousins

10:08.322 --> 10:12.458
who would fight to the death
for that very same throne:

10:12.526 --> 10:14.827
Prince Frederigo
and Prince Raphael.

10:14.894 --> 10:20.165
And I have no interest
in that kind of power!

10:20.233 --> 10:25.103
But you must if you were
to ensure your survival.

10:25.204 --> 10:28.539
Our survival.

10:36.916 --> 10:39.284
Or I must.

10:48.861 --> 10:50.194
My lord!

10:50.262 --> 10:52.964
Cardinal Constanzo
requests you post haste-

10:53.031 --> 10:54.365
Before I've changed
and bathed?

10:54.466 --> 10:56.000
He is ill in his palace.

10:56.068 --> 10:58.269
He made mention of a letter -
A letter?

10:58.337 --> 11:00.639
From Catherina Sforza.

11:02.809 --> 11:04.843
Make way.

11:08.181 --> 11:10.015
Make way!

11:19.793 --> 11:21.393
Where is the cardinal?

11:21.494 --> 11:23.495
Within.

11:23.596 --> 11:25.130
Show me then.

11:25.231 --> 11:26.999
See for yourself.

11:27.067 --> 11:28.734
My lord, wait!

11:30.670 --> 11:32.671
Wear this -

11:32.773 --> 11:34.907
over your mouth.

11:49.723 --> 11:51.758
Constanzo?

11:57.798 --> 11:59.231
Constanzo?

12:01.368 --> 12:03.203
Constanzo!

12:13.381 --> 12:15.682
<i>Do you recognize that?</i>

12:17.018 --> 12:19.219
I commanded
you burn it.

12:19.287 --> 12:21.221
And the letter
inside it.

12:21.322 --> 12:24.424
But I didn't.

12:24.492 --> 12:27.861
And now you must
burn this palace -

12:27.928 --> 12:30.096
with me inside it.

12:30.164 --> 12:32.865
And forgive me for
my disobedience.

12:34.602 --> 12:37.504
Well, why must you burn
for disobedience?

12:37.571 --> 12:41.474
<i>There was a plague-</i>
<i>infested handkerchief -</i>

12:41.542 --> 12:43.276
<i>in the box</i>

12:43.344 --> 12:47.346
that contained
her overtures of peace.

12:47.414 --> 12:49.315
Oh my God.

12:52.552 --> 12:54.753
There are quicker
deaths than burning.

12:54.821 --> 12:58.256
Then throw me a blade -

12:58.324 --> 13:00.691
<i>and burn all that remains.</i>

13:37.964 --> 13:39.798
<i>Make way for His Holiness!</i>

13:41.835 --> 13:44.236
Is this how you announce
your return to Rome?

13:44.304 --> 13:45.771
There was a plot,
Holy Father.

13:45.839 --> 13:47.873
A plague letter,
designed for your person.

13:47.941 --> 13:50.142
Constanzo's curiosity
got the better of him.

13:50.210 --> 13:51.644
So you burn down
his palace?

13:51.712 --> 13:53.379
Better his palace
than the whole quarter.

13:53.447 --> 13:55.815
And where is
Constanzo now?

13:55.883 --> 13:57.283
Burning inside.

14:02.623 --> 14:03.756
What?

14:03.824 --> 14:06.092
Your sacred person
is healthy still.

14:08.229 --> 14:11.064
Catherina Sforza?
Who else?

14:13.334 --> 14:15.001
Walk with us.

14:15.069 --> 14:16.736
What do we need to
know of this matter?

14:16.804 --> 14:18.738
As little as possible.

14:18.806 --> 14:21.041
But a letter was sent.

14:21.109 --> 14:23.010
A false overture
of peace.

14:23.111 --> 14:24.512
I ordered it burnt.

14:24.580 --> 14:26.948
And the King of France
is in possession of Milan.

14:27.015 --> 14:29.116
Was that to be kept
from us as well?

14:29.184 --> 14:30.684
I wanted to tell
you in person.

14:30.752 --> 14:33.987
And Ludovico Sforza
is still at large.

14:35.123 --> 14:37.557
Ah, you have heard.

14:37.625 --> 14:40.827
We do not live entirely
in the dark, Cesare.

14:40.928 --> 14:43.830
He's in hiding with
Catherina's son, Benito.

14:43.898 --> 14:47.100
Who, it seems, he is
willing to hand over to us

14:47.201 --> 14:51.471
in exchange for a pledge
of his own safe passage.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.941
And, uh, where is he now?

14:55.009 --> 14:57.544
Ooh, that is not
for us to know.

14:57.612 --> 15:00.314
Ask your friend
Senor Machiavelli.

15:00.415 --> 15:03.750
It was him who delivered
Ludovico's letter to us.

15:05.153 --> 15:06.620
And do I have your
permission to -

15:06.688 --> 15:10.657
to deliver our pledge into
the hands of Ludovico Sforza?

15:13.695 --> 15:15.929
To lay hands on
the pair of them...

15:18.466 --> 15:23.770
and to bring them in
chains to us in Rome?

15:25.306 --> 15:26.473
You do.

15:26.541 --> 15:27.941
Yah!

15:49.129 --> 15:51.730
You know
Constantinople, don't you?

15:51.798 --> 15:53.064
Intimately.

16:03.008 --> 16:04.775
Do you think it
could be captured

16:04.876 --> 16:06.610
and returned to Rome?

16:06.677 --> 16:08.878
By some miracle,
perhaps.

16:08.946 --> 16:11.814
Ah, well, we don't
trade in miracles.

16:11.882 --> 16:15.685
We are amassing funds
for a great Crusade.

16:15.786 --> 16:19.689
But we fear they could
be needed closer to home.

16:19.757 --> 16:22.792
May I enquire why,
Holiness?

16:22.860 --> 16:25.862
The French have
taken Milan.

16:25.930 --> 16:28.064
I thought your son
had taken Milan.

16:28.166 --> 16:30.167
Hm.

16:30.234 --> 16:32.603
Is there a difference?

16:35.006 --> 16:39.977
Rome needs arms.

16:40.045 --> 16:43.414
And the funds for our
Constantinople endeavour

16:43.515 --> 16:45.783
could have provided them.

16:48.120 --> 16:50.956
I can't leave her
undefended.

16:54.160 --> 16:58.431
If I may be so bold
to suggest, Holiness...

16:58.532 --> 17:00.232
Hm?

17:04.137 --> 17:05.805
The main threat from the Turks

17:05.872 --> 17:07.973
is the shipping.

17:09.541 --> 17:13.612
If the entire Turkish fleet
can be disposed of,

17:13.680 --> 17:14.945
would not His
Holiness's Crusade

17:15.013 --> 17:16.580
have served
its purpose?

17:16.648 --> 17:18.550
Well, how would
we achieve that?

17:18.617 --> 17:20.084
If the pope is
lacking funds,

17:20.185 --> 17:22.819
perhaps the tribe of Abraham
could do it for him.

17:25.723 --> 17:27.358
Again, how?

17:27.425 --> 17:29.994
There are Jews in every port
on the Turkish coastline.

17:30.095 --> 17:31.896
There may be a way,

17:31.964 --> 17:33.598
if the Jews in Rome

17:33.666 --> 17:36.467
could be assured of
His Holiness's favour.

17:39.938 --> 17:41.739
Hm...

17:43.708 --> 17:47.344
Do you think
he's caught us?

17:47.412 --> 17:49.680
He has caught
the office.

17:49.747 --> 17:52.449
Catching the man
is more elusive.

17:58.322 --> 18:00.623
And the knight moves thus.

18:00.690 --> 18:03.192
Yes, though I imagine
you knew that already.

18:03.259 --> 18:04.626
No, my lord.

18:04.694 --> 18:07.429
I'm a novice
to the game of, um-

18:07.496 --> 18:08.797
what was it called again?

18:08.865 --> 18:10.933
You full well know.

18:11.001 --> 18:12.835
Ah....

18:12.902 --> 18:14.737
Chess.

18:20.377 --> 18:23.079
Oh my lord,
now that was unkind.

18:23.147 --> 18:24.280
And was meant to be.

18:24.348 --> 18:26.916
The game is cruelty
personified.

18:29.320 --> 18:32.656
Or, rather,
strategy personified,

18:32.724 --> 18:35.426
my Lord Raphael.

18:35.493 --> 18:38.930
You are beautiful,
Lucrezia Borgia,

18:38.997 --> 18:42.901
but even I, a simple
Neapolitan prince,

18:42.968 --> 18:45.303
can tell that your
beauty hides a design.

18:45.371 --> 18:47.639
Why did you wish
to meet with me?

18:47.707 --> 18:50.108
To learn the game,
of course.

18:50.176 --> 18:52.844
The game of chess or
the game of inheritance?

18:52.945 --> 18:54.913
There is a difference?

18:54.981 --> 18:58.250
In both, the rules are fixed,
and have been for centuries.

18:58.317 --> 19:00.018
And the room for
manoeuvre is limited.

19:00.085 --> 19:03.088
A king dies and
the game begins again.

19:03.156 --> 19:04.756
So the players are...

19:04.824 --> 19:07.225
My half brother
Frederigo and I.

19:07.326 --> 19:09.660
And there can only
be one winner.

19:09.728 --> 19:11.495
You?

19:11.563 --> 19:14.231
That is how I intend it.

19:17.268 --> 19:19.069
And that bastard child

19:19.137 --> 19:20.671
shall find no more
favour in me

19:20.739 --> 19:22.506
than it did with
my uncle, the king.

19:23.775 --> 19:25.008
No?

19:25.076 --> 19:28.011
He'll be returned to Rome.

19:28.079 --> 19:30.981
Or to a stable -
you can choose which.

19:31.049 --> 19:33.284
I will ensure all the
traditional proprieties

19:33.351 --> 19:35.219
are upheld.

19:35.320 --> 19:37.922
And Lucrezia Borgia

19:37.989 --> 19:41.592
shall have as little influence
on the court of Naples

19:41.660 --> 19:43.961
as your queen on this board.

19:50.702 --> 19:54.973
So I have a king,
two bishops, and a knight.

19:56.342 --> 19:59.544
Is there a place for
a pope in this game?

19:59.612 --> 20:02.513
There is no pope
in the game of chess.

20:02.581 --> 20:07.885
But the game of succession
has a pope, surely.

20:19.031 --> 20:21.399
Sh...

21:27.002 --> 21:28.636
You.

21:30.473 --> 21:32.207
And you.

21:36.546 --> 21:38.647
You followed me here.

21:40.817 --> 21:43.452
Surely it is you
who followed me, sir.

21:44.059 --> 21:45.742
To Rome?

21:47.991 --> 21:52.294
I have a friend here -
paid for my journey.

21:52.362 --> 21:54.563
But you, gentle sir,
have followed me.

21:58.268 --> 22:00.036
I am not gentle.

22:01.471 --> 22:03.306
I remember.

22:14.018 --> 22:15.718
Follow.

22:24.194 --> 22:37.707
[♪]

22:37.709 --> 22:49.686
[♪]

24:00.192 --> 24:02.326
You will tell no one
of this place.

24:11.036 --> 24:14.506
You cannot ask where I go
or where I've been.

24:16.942 --> 24:20.178
And if you do not see me
for a week or more,

24:20.246 --> 24:22.613
then you will wait.

24:22.681 --> 24:25.917
And if you cannot,

24:26.018 --> 24:31.089
and all this comes
to nought -

24:33.459 --> 24:37.061
then you will leave,

24:37.129 --> 24:39.464
and you will leave
in silence.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.735
And that silence you
will carry to your grave.

24:47.873 --> 24:50.374
But if you break
that silence,

24:55.013 --> 24:57.548
I will find you.

25:00.852 --> 25:03.454
And believe me, boy,

25:03.555 --> 25:05.656
that you do not want.

25:07.759 --> 25:09.493
She writes to me,

25:09.561 --> 25:11.562
tells me her every move
is watched.

25:11.630 --> 25:13.730
She should wear
a veil then.

25:13.832 --> 25:16.466
Why?

25:16.567 --> 25:19.869
To hide her true feelings.

25:19.936 --> 25:23.739
She loves this husband,
Cesare; she chose him.

25:23.840 --> 25:25.807
Is it only me
he disappoints?

25:25.875 --> 25:27.943
You're too harsh.

25:28.011 --> 25:30.045
When I pleaded her
son's case to the king,

25:30.113 --> 25:33.382
her husband just sat there
beside me saying nothing.

25:33.450 --> 25:35.451
Naples is not Rome.
No.

25:35.519 --> 25:37.119
<i>My lady.</i>

25:37.187 --> 25:39.755
And Naples may soon
not even be Naples.

25:39.823 --> 25:41.123
A French presence there

25:41.190 --> 25:43.125
would see that they
did our bidding.

25:43.193 --> 25:44.693
A French presence there

25:44.761 --> 25:46.695
would end her marriage
for good.

25:46.763 --> 25:49.465
She hopes to wield some
influence, Cesare,

25:49.566 --> 25:51.201
on the next heir
to the throne.

25:51.268 --> 25:54.204
And just how will she manage that?
Through your father.

25:54.305 --> 25:56.106
The investiture of the crown

25:56.174 --> 25:58.008
still lies with the pope,
does it not?

25:58.076 --> 26:00.110
Not the choice
of who wears it.

26:00.178 --> 26:03.948
What power has a crown
without papal investiture?

26:04.016 --> 26:05.983
Clever girl.

26:06.051 --> 26:09.286
If I were to die and my
half brother were to die,

26:09.354 --> 26:12.189
your husband would
take the throne.

26:13.825 --> 26:16.226
Well, that's
a lot of dying.

26:17.195 --> 26:19.196
Death happens
all the time here -

26:20.765 --> 26:22.666
By accident.

26:22.734 --> 26:24.301
Look at my uncle.

26:24.402 --> 26:26.670
That was a horrible accident.

26:26.737 --> 26:29.239
Who could have thought?

26:29.307 --> 26:31.575
His father, actually.

26:31.676 --> 26:34.378
He had that pool stocked
for that very purpose.

26:38.015 --> 26:40.317
Naples terrifies me.

26:41.319 --> 26:45.956
It has terrified me ever
since I learnt to walk.

26:46.023 --> 26:49.158
Little Sebastian here-

26:49.259 --> 26:52.461
I have to feed him
from my own plate-

26:52.529 --> 26:55.030
lest my half-brother
try and poison him.

26:55.098 --> 26:57.600
Why would do that?

26:57.701 --> 26:59.702
Any number of reasons.

26:59.803 --> 27:02.070
For sport, to frighten me,

27:02.138 --> 27:05.707
or merely
to show me he can...

27:05.775 --> 27:08.343
eliminate
what's dear to me.

27:08.411 --> 27:10.879
At will.

27:14.984 --> 27:18.020
I know your plight,
Lucrezia Borgia.

27:18.087 --> 27:19.988
I even pleaded
with King Ferdinand

27:20.056 --> 27:21.957
to let your child
live here.

27:22.025 --> 27:24.493
But my words meant
little then,

27:24.560 --> 27:26.328
and will mean even less

27:26.395 --> 27:28.263
when my brother
takes the crown.

27:29.865 --> 27:31.766
Must your brother
take the crown?

27:31.834 --> 27:33.768
Unless he dies.

27:33.836 --> 27:36.871
Believe me,
I'm no murderer.

27:39.975 --> 27:43.077
But the pope must invest

27:43.144 --> 27:45.346
the new-crowned
King of Naples.

27:45.414 --> 27:47.715
What of it?

27:47.816 --> 27:49.850
If there is any scandal,

27:49.918 --> 27:53.521
any rumour of
public ignominy,

27:53.588 --> 27:56.457
the pope may refuse.

27:56.525 --> 27:58.893
My brother has
a heart of ice.

27:58.961 --> 28:01.629
But only I know
that heart.

28:01.697 --> 28:03.865
The world knows
a paragon

28:03.933 --> 28:06.634
of manliness, duty,
and virtue.

28:09.605 --> 28:12.139
We all have our secrets.

28:12.207 --> 28:14.175
Indeed.

28:20.382 --> 28:22.349
I'll be gone, perhaps days,
perhaps weeks.

28:22.417 --> 28:23.951
Where are you going?

28:24.019 --> 28:26.487
I told you!
Never ask that question!

28:26.555 --> 28:28.422
Now, you stay ignorant,
you stay alive, boy!

28:28.490 --> 28:30.290
Days, weeks.
What am I to do?

28:31.659 --> 28:33.260
Enjoy the delights
of Rome.

28:33.328 --> 28:35.496
There's money
in that jar.

28:35.564 --> 28:37.364
Hang around
Bramante's studio.

28:37.432 --> 28:39.733
Maybe you'll catch
his eye, no?

28:51.846 --> 28:54.715
If you are here
when I return...

28:58.853 --> 29:00.721
I would like that.

29:15.537 --> 29:18.406
There is a quarry,
north of here.

29:18.473 --> 29:21.008
It is arranged the
exchange will happen there.

29:21.076 --> 29:23.678
Ludovico will deliver
the boy, have no doubt.

29:26.214 --> 29:28.282
Guide us there,
Signor Machiavelli,

29:28.350 --> 29:31.385
then absent yourself.

29:31.453 --> 29:34.521
There are complications
in the air?

29:34.589 --> 29:38.392
No, no, the outcome will
be simplicity itself.

29:38.460 --> 29:40.862
But I would recommend you
keep your hands clean.

29:59.247 --> 30:00.781
What is this place?

30:00.849 --> 30:02.349
It's a disused quarry.

30:02.417 --> 30:05.486
Here we will meet with forces
loyal to the Sforza family

30:05.553 --> 30:08.389
who will escort
you home to Mother.

30:08.490 --> 30:10.223
Have no fear.

30:31.745 --> 30:33.512
Sebastian?

30:41.622 --> 30:43.222
Oh God.

30:45.458 --> 30:48.127
Oh God.

30:49.896 --> 30:52.499
He did have secrets -
poisonous ones.

30:52.600 --> 30:53.967
Poison, what poison?

30:54.035 --> 30:56.169
Would it be it cantarella?
I know something of it!

30:58.273 --> 31:00.140
The dog ate from my plate.

31:00.208 --> 31:01.342
Forget the dog.

31:01.443 --> 31:03.144
Guards! Anybody!

31:03.211 --> 31:04.712
Quickly!

31:06.982 --> 31:09.350
There are two sights
and a double notch.

31:11.053 --> 31:12.587
Yes.

31:12.654 --> 31:14.155
This your invention?

31:15.391 --> 31:17.625
I wish I could claim so.

31:17.693 --> 31:20.629
But no, Leonardo's.

31:20.730 --> 31:22.431
My lord, my lord.

31:30.541 --> 31:32.041
It's empty.

31:32.109 --> 31:34.177
There is no one here,
Ludovico.

31:34.245 --> 31:35.979
Well, Benito,

31:36.047 --> 31:37.447
then we are
the first to arrive

31:37.548 --> 31:41.451
and must be patient and wait.

31:41.519 --> 31:43.120
Half of Italy wants
our heads

31:43.188 --> 31:45.555
and you're asking me
to be patient.

31:53.566 --> 31:54.633
What happened?

31:54.701 --> 31:56.367
Poison-cantarella!

31:56.435 --> 31:58.536
Who did it?
Does it matter now?

31:58.604 --> 32:00.605
Go and get a physician,
love- quickly!

32:02.308 --> 32:04.043
You said you line one
sight with the other?

32:04.110 --> 32:05.744
And the sights with
your target, my lord.

32:24.031 --> 32:25.732
<i>What have you done?</i>

32:26.801 --> 32:28.101
Here.

32:28.169 --> 32:30.570
Water! Water!
I need water!

32:34.142 --> 32:36.009
Sh, sh, sh.
This is the Roman cure?

32:36.077 --> 32:37.711
It is the only cure!

32:46.921 --> 32:48.622
<i>I said "capture!"</i>

32:48.689 --> 32:50.757
Not "kill"!

32:50.859 --> 32:53.026
<i>It was agreed!</i>

32:53.094 --> 32:56.196
There was no mention
of killing!

32:56.263 --> 32:58.398
That dog will bite no more.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.367
Your cure is useless,
my lady.

33:01.435 --> 33:02.936
He cannot breathe.

33:03.003 --> 33:04.837
But if this is cantarella,
I have done this before.

33:04.905 --> 33:06.105
It's not cantarella,

33:06.173 --> 33:09.643
it's Galerina,
a poisonous mushroom.

33:09.711 --> 33:11.545
He's dying of lack of breath;

33:11.613 --> 33:13.747
his whole throat is swollen.

33:20.823 --> 33:22.758
<i>What of our agreement?</i>

33:22.859 --> 33:24.660
My guarantee of safe passage!

33:24.728 --> 33:27.229
Now!
I will have it now!

33:29.599 --> 33:31.934
<i>I trusted you!</i>

33:32.002 --> 33:34.318
You barbarian!

33:42.479 --> 33:43.845
<i>Ludovico!</i>

33:45.281 --> 33:47.316
There!

33:55.292 --> 33:57.794
I thank you!

34:07.071 --> 34:08.371
He breathes.

34:08.438 --> 34:10.273
We must hold his throat
thus for two hours

34:10.341 --> 34:12.576
until the swelling
subsides.

34:16.380 --> 34:18.683
You.

34:18.750 --> 34:21.920
I accuse you of the
murder of your brother!

34:21.987 --> 34:24.188
How can I have killed that
which is not yet dead?

34:24.255 --> 34:26.056
Of the poisoning
of the only barrier

34:26.123 --> 34:28.659
that lies between you
and the throne of Naples.

34:28.726 --> 34:30.795
An enterprise in which
I failed miserably.

34:32.598 --> 34:35.533
Choke him on his own bile-
I would like to see that.

34:37.637 --> 34:39.771
<i>Be still, Cousin.</i>

34:39.839 --> 34:41.806
Hold him still!

34:41.875 --> 34:44.877
Sh, sh!

34:44.945 --> 34:46.277
Be still.

34:58.825 --> 35:00.726
What are you doing here?

35:00.793 --> 35:03.729
Checking on
my lady's investments.

35:06.366 --> 35:09.335
We all need vermin
like you -

35:09.402 --> 35:12.838
to search out
secrets, communicate,

35:12.906 --> 35:16.108
anything that cannot be
held in a diplomatic pouch.

35:16.175 --> 35:18.243
You should leave, now.
He could return.

35:18.310 --> 35:20.144
He's in the North,
I heard.

35:20.212 --> 35:21.746
Far from here.

35:21.847 --> 35:23.314
Doing what?

35:23.382 --> 35:26.116
Are you not being paid
good coin to find that out?

35:26.184 --> 35:28.018
I have to tread
carefully with him.

35:28.086 --> 35:29.453
I have to earn his affection.

35:29.521 --> 35:32.823
Hm.
The long game.

35:32.924 --> 35:35.426
That will only last as
long as his love lasts.

35:35.493 --> 35:38.562
Well, then, there is time,
even for vermin like me.

35:39.931 --> 35:42.700
Is it possible?

35:42.768 --> 35:44.469
Have you fallen for him?

35:44.536 --> 35:48.373
I'm in a Devil's bed, Rufio.

35:48.474 --> 35:50.908
Have you ever been
embraced by the Devil?

35:50.976 --> 35:52.176
Hm?

35:52.244 --> 35:54.512
You ever felt
his touch?

35:54.580 --> 35:57.082
Have you ever
dared to touch him?

35:58.985 --> 36:00.853
I doubt it.

36:00.920 --> 36:04.556
Yes.
That's love.

36:07.326 --> 36:10.028
It doesn't smell good.

36:13.065 --> 36:15.934
<i>What a dingy place for it.</i>

36:16.001 --> 36:18.670
But, then, certain love
thrives best in the gutter.

36:18.771 --> 36:20.104
I see.

36:20.172 --> 36:21.493
You've come here
to pass judgment.

36:21.507 --> 36:23.942
No, I came to
inhale his odour.

36:24.009 --> 36:27.178
He's my double here in Rome.

36:27.245 --> 36:32.316
We will meet, one day,
he and I.

36:32.417 --> 36:34.885
Stick to him.

36:34.953 --> 36:37.921
Sooner or later he will
tell you everything.

36:37.989 --> 36:40.590
Nothing is too small.

36:40.657 --> 36:43.192
Remember the book.

36:43.260 --> 36:45.928
Catallus's Carmina.

36:45.996 --> 36:48.231
Good boy.

37:00.545 --> 37:03.047
Would you play
<i>more chess, my lord?</i>

37:05.918 --> 37:08.085
I would be alone.

37:08.153 --> 37:12.323
I can understand why.

37:12.391 --> 37:13.858
You failed.

37:13.959 --> 37:15.359
How did I fail?

37:15.427 --> 37:18.829
It's foolish to attempt
murder and to fail.

37:20.899 --> 37:24.367
Better to succeed,
I'm sure.

37:24.435 --> 37:27.771
If you embark upon that course,
yes, much better.

37:35.513 --> 37:39.950
My brother has always
been histrionic.

37:40.018 --> 37:44.622
As a child, he accused me
of drowning his pet newt.

37:44.723 --> 37:46.190
And did you?

37:46.258 --> 37:48.225
How does one
drown a newt?

37:52.931 --> 37:55.799
There will be consequences.

37:55.867 --> 37:59.603
And you, the pope's bastard,
will be the judge of that?

37:59.671 --> 38:01.839
The pope has
in his gift

38:01.906 --> 38:04.141
the investiture
of the Kingdom of Naples.

38:05.377 --> 38:07.011
How could he
in all conscience

38:07.079 --> 38:08.947
place a murderer
on the throne?

38:09.014 --> 38:11.516
You lack evidence, Madame.

38:11.617 --> 38:15.320
I intend to find it.

38:21.227 --> 38:24.696
You are on dangerous
ground, my lady.

38:24.763 --> 38:27.031
Yes, I can see that.

38:27.099 --> 38:29.367
You have your fingers
against my throat.

38:34.306 --> 38:36.907
Failed again.

39:16.981 --> 39:21.818
I was given word that some
great lady needs a potion.

39:21.886 --> 39:23.720
A love potion?

39:23.788 --> 39:27.657
Your husband sleeps
between the sheets?

39:27.758 --> 39:29.759
I know you.

39:29.827 --> 39:32.363
What if my needs
were more lethal?

39:32.430 --> 39:34.464
I only deal in cures.

39:34.532 --> 39:36.299
I heard
a different story.

39:36.367 --> 39:38.868
I don't understand
your words.

39:38.936 --> 39:42.205
You provided certain potions
to a certain party.

39:42.273 --> 39:43.840
And I still don't
understand you.

39:45.109 --> 39:47.210
Do they burn witches
in these parts?

39:47.311 --> 39:49.012
I am no witch, my lady.

39:49.080 --> 39:51.314
I tend the forest,
I gather its fruits.

39:51.382 --> 39:53.116
And sell them to
whomever has need of them

39:53.217 --> 39:55.352
for good or for ill!

39:55.420 --> 39:57.655
But the truth
might yet save you.

39:57.756 --> 39:59.056
The truth?

39:59.123 --> 40:01.825
You gave
the Galerina mushroom.

40:01.893 --> 40:03.760
I gave no Galerina.

40:03.828 --> 40:06.096
I gave a dried powder
mixed with juniper!

40:06.163 --> 40:07.097
To whom?

40:09.367 --> 40:11.268
Pay me first.

40:22.680 --> 40:24.214
To Prince Raphael.

40:40.032 --> 40:41.866
I asked you
to meet with me.

40:41.967 --> 40:43.601
To play the game again?

40:43.702 --> 40:47.371
We could do that too.

40:47.439 --> 40:49.807
I asked you to meet
with me to suggest

40:49.874 --> 40:53.577
that there might be two
options available to you.

40:53.679 --> 40:57.682
One, you pursue your
quest for the crown,

40:57.749 --> 41:00.251
for the pope's blessing.

41:00.352 --> 41:01.986
And you will be accused

41:02.054 --> 41:03.988
of the attempted murder
of your half-brother.

41:04.056 --> 41:05.690
And I repeat,
my brother lies.

41:05.791 --> 41:07.125
He has evidence.

41:07.192 --> 41:08.593
And I've heard
of your evidence.

41:08.661 --> 41:10.861
An old crone
from the forest.

41:10.929 --> 41:12.430
She should be burnt
as a witch.

41:12.498 --> 41:16.068
Well, who knows,
perhaps one day she will be.

41:16.135 --> 41:17.536
What does she say?

41:17.603 --> 41:19.904
That she gave
you a mixture

41:19.972 --> 41:22.975
of dried Galerina
and juniper berries.

41:23.042 --> 41:26.078
Someone primed her
to say that.

41:26.145 --> 41:29.414
Find out who put
the words in her mouth.

41:32.785 --> 41:35.487
Well, who, then?

41:35.555 --> 41:37.990
You perhaps?

41:38.091 --> 41:39.858
Your reputation
does precede you.

41:41.762 --> 41:42.962
Sh, sh.

41:43.029 --> 41:44.330
Your second choice

41:44.397 --> 41:46.165
is to hand the field
over to your brother,

41:46.233 --> 41:48.634
whom the pope will
happily invest,

41:48.702 --> 41:50.569
and retire to your
hunting lodges

41:50.637 --> 41:52.871
with your reputation
intact.

41:52.939 --> 41:54.807
Thank you, nurse.
My lady.

41:56.409 --> 41:58.076
Hunting's a good life.

41:58.144 --> 42:00.278
I have a third, you know.
What's that?

42:00.346 --> 42:01.713
I could poison
the both of you -

42:01.781 --> 42:03.449
All of you.

42:03.550 --> 42:05.717
And succeed this time?

42:05.818 --> 42:08.353
I'll take the second choice

42:08.421 --> 42:12.724
if only to see you realize
the folly of your stratagem.

42:14.026 --> 42:15.159
You will lose.

42:15.227 --> 42:18.262
You will lose
most horribly.

42:28.440 --> 42:30.807
He's very young.
Will he be faithful?

42:30.909 --> 42:32.709
One hopes.
Raise...

42:33.978 --> 42:36.346
His palace has fountains...
Release.

42:36.414 --> 42:40.351
A belvedere,
extensive hunting grounds.

42:40.419 --> 42:42.820
He hunts, not a good
thing in a husband.

42:42.888 --> 42:44.255
You hunted.

42:44.323 --> 42:45.356
Rarely.

42:45.424 --> 42:47.825
And only with you,
hm?

42:47.893 --> 42:50.061
I will hunt with him then.

42:52.131 --> 42:53.731
Well...

42:53.799 --> 42:56.101
Let's get it over with.

42:59.605 --> 43:01.172
Dearest.

43:03.342 --> 43:08.379
Holiness, may I present
to you Vincenzo Salvatore?

43:14.853 --> 43:18.089
Your Holiness.

43:18.157 --> 43:20.626
Your hands.
My hands?

43:20.694 --> 43:22.928
Well, let me touch
your hands.

43:24.497 --> 43:27.433
Ah, soft.
They never worked the land.

43:27.500 --> 43:30.335
They toil with a feathered
quill, your Holiness.

43:30.403 --> 43:32.037
They plow with that.

43:34.340 --> 43:35.741
Is he deranged?

43:35.842 --> 43:37.844
No, Your Holiness,
he's a poet.

43:37.945 --> 43:39.578
A poet.

43:39.646 --> 43:42.415
So, deranged.

43:42.482 --> 43:45.317
He may be another
Petrarch, Holiness.

43:45.418 --> 43:48.554
Ah, yes.

43:48.621 --> 43:51.590
But can you
make her laugh?

43:58.331 --> 44:00.665
Well, marry him if you will.

44:05.538 --> 44:06.672
Our son.

44:06.739 --> 44:08.774
Come closer.

44:16.482 --> 44:19.485
What of our command in
regard to Ludovico Sforza?

44:19.552 --> 44:20.953
I executed it.

44:21.020 --> 44:22.588
He is no more.

44:22.689 --> 44:25.958
That was not
our command!

44:26.025 --> 44:28.828
You were to bring him
to Rome in chains.

44:28.895 --> 44:31.030
What purchase can we get
with a dead Sforza?

44:31.098 --> 44:32.832
Two dead Sforzas.

44:32.900 --> 44:37.070
Are you to be the one
who decides Rome's future?

44:37.171 --> 44:38.938
Father...
Who shapes our fate?

44:39.006 --> 44:42.509
Who dictates our strategies?

44:42.577 --> 44:46.013
Why in God's name
did you kill them?

44:46.081 --> 44:47.614
Because the French King
demanded it.

44:47.716 --> 44:49.316
And what of our wishes?

44:57.425 --> 44:59.793
Who are we to trust
if not our family?

44:59.894 --> 45:01.761
Who are we to rely on?

45:01.829 --> 45:02.963
You can trust me, Father.

45:03.030 --> 45:06.700
Oh?
We can?

45:06.801 --> 45:08.869
Why?

45:08.937 --> 45:11.172
Because you have
no alternative.

45:49.777 --> 45:52.446
<i>You wonderful people!</i>

45:59.220 --> 46:01.722
Thank you!

46:01.789 --> 46:04.592
So, we're safe now?

46:04.659 --> 46:07.828
As long as this king lives,
yes, we're safe.

46:16.406 --> 46:19.641
<i>I am Catherina</i>
<i>Sforza's eyes and ears</i>

46:19.709 --> 46:23.345
<i>in this nest of vipers,</i>

46:23.413 --> 46:26.582
<i>and I would beg you,</i>
<i>my liege,</i>

46:26.649 --> 46:30.753
<i>to make no hasty moves</i>
<i>until my exit is secured.</i>

46:54.779 --> 46:58.481
Bring me my copy
of Catullus - Carmina.

46:58.582 --> 47:00.216
Yes, Your Majesty.
