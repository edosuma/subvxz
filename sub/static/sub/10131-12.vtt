07:04.758 --> 07:06.301
- Alright.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.301
- Feed the kid, Gomer.

07:06.343 --> 07:07.635
Okay, Goob.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.306
Jess, think about it.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.557
Every decision we make

07:12.599 --> 07:14.059
could possibly

07:12.599 --> 07:14.059
affect these girls

07:14.101 --> 07:15.810
for the rest

07:14.101 --> 07:15.810
of their lives.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.647
What should we feed Michelle?

07:20.857 --> 07:22.984
Strained broccoli

07:20.857 --> 07:22.984
or strained peas?

07:23.610 --> 07:24.903
Don't ask me.

07:27.030 --> 07:30.117
(Joey)

07:27.030 --> 07:30.117
'Michelle, it's up to you.'

07:30.158 --> 07:32.702
Now remember,

07:30.158 --> 07:32.702
that's your decision.

07:33.536 --> 07:34.662
Mm-hmm.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.211
Hi, honey. Homework?

07:41.253 --> 07:42.629
Yeah, we're

07:41.253 --> 07:42.629
learning about

07:42.670 --> 07:43.964
"The bill of rights."

07:44.005 --> 07:45.548
Does freedom of speech

07:44.005 --> 07:45.548
mean I can say

07:45.590 --> 07:47.426
anything I want

07:45.590 --> 07:47.426
around the house?

07:47.467 --> 07:50.304
Sure, but don't forget,

07:47.467 --> 07:50.304
I have freedom of

07:50.345 --> 07:52.513
say that again,

07:50.345 --> 07:52.513
and you're grounded.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.601
Look, D.J., there's..

07:57.685 --> 07:58.895
D.J..

07:59.980 --> 08:02.274
D.J., there's

07:59.980 --> 08:02.274
something I want you

08:02.316 --> 08:04.443
to think about

08:02.316 --> 08:04.443
very carefully.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.153
I called

08:04.484 --> 08:06.153
a casting director

08:06.194 --> 08:07.570
and there's an audition

08:06.194 --> 08:07.570

08:07.612 --> 08:08.905
for a cereal commercial.

08:08.947 --> 08:10.740
Great! I want to do it.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.659
Honey, you realize the

08:10.782 --> 08:12.659
chances of getting this job

08:12.700 --> 08:15.287
are very,

08:12.700 --> 08:15.287
very tiny, microscopic.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.372
I want to do it.

08:17.414 --> 08:20.292
If you do this,

08:17.414 --> 08:20.292
it should be for fun.

08:20.334 --> 08:21.668
I don't want you to

08:20.334 --> 08:21.668
feel disappointed

08:21.709 --> 08:22.919
if you don't get it.

08:23.962 --> 08:27.715
Listen to me, dad.

08:23.962 --> 08:27.715
I want to do it.

08:29.217 --> 08:32.512
I understand

08:29.217 --> 08:32.512
you want to do it.

08:32.553 --> 08:33.721
But will you

08:32.553 --> 08:33.721
consider all this

08:33.763 --> 08:35.682
before you make

08:33.763 --> 08:35.682
your decision?

08:35.723 --> 08:37.058
Sure, dad.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.310
Okay.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.735

08:51.072 --> 08:53.367

08:57.954 --> 09:00.207

Very nice audition, Karen.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.584
Thank you so much, Vivian.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.420
It felt good for me too.

09:06.838 --> 09:09.257
Why don't I leave you

09:06.838 --> 09:09.257

09:12.093 --> 09:14.012
Well, I hope I'll be

09:12.093 --> 09:14.012

09:21.478 --> 09:24.189
or a tiny grownup?

09:25.524 --> 09:26.607
Look, Steph, why don't

09:25.524 --> 09:26.607
you go over there

09:26.649 --> 09:28.026
and do some

09:29.194 --> 09:31.821
Uncle Jesse,

09:29.194 --> 09:31.821

it looks as though

14:59.273 --> 15:01.275
Michelle has toddled up

15:01.317 --> 15:03.611
to the drive-through

15:01.317 --> 15:03.611
window again.

15:04.779 --> 15:07.948
Alright, I'm weak, I'm weak!

15:07.990 --> 15:11.369
I'm not Mr. Willpower,

15:07.990 --> 15:11.369
I'm Mr. Cholesterol.

15:12.829 --> 15:17.500
Joey, you went from

15:12.829 --> 15:17.500
all junk food to all..

15:17.542 --> 15:19.252
I don't know what the hell

15:17.542 --> 15:19.252
you've been eating.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.838
There's another choice here.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.549
Try moderation. More fruit.

15:24.591 --> 15:27.093
- More fiber. Less fat.

15:24.591 --> 15:27.093
- And we'll help out.

15:27.134 --> 15:28.887
I'll start by helping you eat

15:27.134 --> 15:28.887
this burger and fries.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.179
Thank you.

15:31.305 --> 15:32.932
Come here, Michelle.

15:32.973 --> 15:35.976
Guys, look. I've got to get

15:32.973 --> 15:35.976
back to the station, okay?

15:36.018 --> 15:38.479
Listen to me.

15:36.018 --> 15:38.479
This is real important.

15:38.521 --> 15:40.774
Keep an eye on

15:38.521 --> 15:40.774
D.J. and Stephanie.

15:40.815 --> 15:43.192
Right now, they're

15:40.815 --> 15:43.192
avoiding each other

15:43.234 --> 15:45.152
but I have a feeling

15:43.234 --> 15:45.152
that's only temporary

15:45.194 --> 15:46.987
considering they

15:45.194 --> 15:46.987
share a bedroom.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.406
Alright. We'll

15:47.029 --> 15:48.406
take care of it.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.616
We got it.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.951
Bye-bye, Michelle.

15:51.992 --> 15:54.954
And please, don't

15:51.992 --> 15:54.954
ever go into acting.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.082
Mwah!

16:16.434 --> 16:18.812
"I love Oat Boats

16:16.434 --> 16:18.812
because Stephanie

16:18.853 --> 16:20.730
"takes heaping

16:18.853 --> 16:20.730
spoonful of cereal.

16:20.772 --> 16:23.065
They taste great.

16:20.772 --> 16:23.065
She takes a bite."

16:23.107 --> 16:24.651
[giggles]

16:26.193 --> 16:28.112
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:26.193 --> 16:28.112
Go ahead. Rehearse.

16:29.071 --> 16:30.364
"I love Oat Boats

16:30.406 --> 16:32.492
"because Stephanie

16:30.406 --> 16:32.492
takes heaping spoon--"

16:32.533 --> 16:34.118
[giggles]

16:35.662 --> 16:37.121
If I'm doing

16:35.662 --> 16:37.121
something wrong

16:37.163 --> 16:38.623
will you help me?

16:38.665 --> 16:41.584
You didn't need any help

16:38.665 --> 16:41.584
when you stole my part.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.503
Are you sure

16:41.626 --> 16:43.503
you're not mad at me?

16:43.544 --> 16:46.798
Don't be silly.

16:43.544 --> 16:46.798
I'm glad I didn't get it.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.342
You'll miss a lot of school

16:46.840 --> 16:49.342
doing that commercial

16:49.383 --> 16:51.886
and they'll probably

16:49.383 --> 16:51.886
leave you back.

16:51.928 --> 16:53.513
I think you're jealous.

16:53.554 --> 16:56.098
Me, jealous?

16:56.140 --> 16:58.351
But I am hungry.

16:58.392 --> 17:00.979
Fine. You can have it.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.106
Give me that right now!

17:05.065 --> 17:07.276
- Give me it!

17:05.065 --> 17:07.276
- No way, Jose.

17:07.318 --> 17:09.904
Give me it!

17:07.318 --> 17:09.904
You're a thief!

17:09.946 --> 17:11.113
You're jealous!

17:11.155 --> 17:12.573
- Thief!

17:11.155 --> 17:12.573
- Jealous!

17:12.615 --> 17:14.325
Give me that,

17:12.615 --> 17:14.325
Stephanie Judith!

17:14.367 --> 17:16.536
No, Donna Jo Margaret!

17:17.328 --> 17:18.746
Aah!

17:21.749 --> 17:23.501
Why am I crawling?

17:25.586 --> 17:26.671
- Hey, you guys.

17:25.586 --> 17:26.671
- Take it easy.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.215
Ladies, ladies,

17:26.713 --> 17:29.215
ladies. Whoa!

17:30.800 --> 17:31.926
She stole my cereal!

17:31.968 --> 17:33.135
She stole my part!

17:33.177 --> 17:34.637
- Jealous!

17:33.177 --> 17:34.637
- Thief!

17:34.679 --> 17:38.975
Well, we got that

17:34.679 --> 17:38.975
all out of our systems.

17:39.017 --> 17:41.561
Why don't you two just

17:39.017 --> 17:41.561
give each other a nice kiss

17:41.602 --> 17:42.812
and make up.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.737
Alright. Come here,

17:48.484 --> 17:50.737
you. Here.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.906
You take your

17:50.778 --> 17:52.906
Oat Boats

17:52.947 --> 17:55.449
and go practice in

17:52.947 --> 17:55.449
the living room, okay?

17:55.491 --> 17:57.243
Stephanie Judith.

17:57.284 --> 17:59.245
Donna Jo Margaret.

18:01.121 --> 18:02.498
Margaret?

18:03.917 --> 18:05.376
Uh, D.J., why don't you

18:03.917 --> 18:05.376
wait downstairs

18:05.418 --> 18:06.836
and we'll be down

18:05.418 --> 18:06.836
in a minute.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.170
- But you said--

18:06.878 --> 18:08.170
- D.J.

18:25.063 --> 18:26.606
D.J., we need to talk.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.232
Let me save you

18:26.647 --> 18:28.232
a lot of trouble.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.401
You're right, I'm wrong,

18:28.274 --> 18:30.401
and I don't care.

18:48.669 --> 18:52.548
Listen, D.J., Jesse

18:48.669 --> 18:52.548
and I strike out

18:52.590 --> 18:54.425
on auditions

18:52.590 --> 18:54.425
all the time.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.843
Being a performer is basically

18:55.885 --> 18:57.344
a series of rejections

18:57.386 --> 19:00.056
occasionally interrupted

18:57.386 --> 19:00.056
by work.

19:00.098 --> 19:03.309
Oh, yeah? Well, did either

19:00.098 --> 19:03.309
of you have a part stolen

19:03.350 --> 19:04.811
by your little sister?

19:07.855 --> 19:09.899
[sighs]

19:14.194 --> 19:16.614
Uh, yeah, you know something?

19:14.194 --> 19:16.614
She's right.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.198
D.J., you're right.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.952
Stephanie stole that part

19:18.240 --> 19:20.952
right out from under you.

19:20.994 --> 19:23.579
In fact, she planned

19:20.994 --> 19:23.579
this whole thing.

19:23.621 --> 19:25.539
She tricked us into

19:23.621 --> 19:25.539
bringing her along

19:25.581 --> 19:28.417
pretending that

19:25.581 --> 19:28.417
she cares about you.

19:29.752 --> 19:32.546
The conniving

19:29.752 --> 19:32.546
little sneak.

19:32.588 --> 19:33.714
'And then, you fell'

19:33.756 --> 19:35.382
into Stephanie's

19:33.756 --> 19:35.382
fiendish little trap

19:35.424 --> 19:37.135
by doing a great audition.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.887
The monster.

19:39.929 --> 19:43.182
Meanwhile, the sinister

19:39.929 --> 19:43.182
little Stephanie

19:43.223 --> 19:44.517
she used her

19:43.223 --> 19:44.517
telekinetic powers

19:44.558 --> 19:45.810
to send us

19:44.558 --> 19:45.810
out of the room

19:45.852 --> 19:48.479
so she could steal

19:45.852 --> 19:48.479
your commercial.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.230
Ooh!

19:51.107 --> 19:53.275
I say we

19:51.107 --> 19:53.275
light some torches

19:53.317 --> 19:54.443
find the she-devil

19:54.485 --> 19:56.403
and drive her

19:54.485 --> 19:56.403
into the night!

20:00.324 --> 20:02.994
Okay, you guys were right.

20:03.036 --> 20:04.996
She didn't do it on purpose.

20:06.122 --> 20:07.289
But I'm still mad at her.

20:07.331 --> 20:08.457
Uh!

20:10.918 --> 20:13.129
Alright, alright, kiddo.

20:13.171 --> 20:15.173
I wanna know

20:13.171 --> 20:15.173
what's eatin' ya.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.384
Alright, pal. Come on.

20:18.425 --> 20:20.219
What's the matter?

20:18.425 --> 20:20.219
Tell us.

20:20.260 --> 20:21.721
I don't know.

20:21.762 --> 20:24.515
I'm so sick of sisters.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.018
Everything was just fine

20:24.557 --> 20:27.018
when it was just me.

20:28.019 --> 20:30.063
Then, Stephanie came along

20:30.104 --> 20:33.357
and everyone said

20:30.104 --> 20:33.357
she was<i> so</i> cute.

20:33.399 --> 20:37.653
Now everyone says

20:33.399 --> 20:37.653
Michelle is<i> so</i> cute.

20:37.695 --> 20:40.198
It's<i> so disgusting.</i>

20:42.075 --> 20:43.743
Well, was it

20:42.075 --> 20:43.743
<i>so</i> disgusting

20:43.784 --> 20:44.952
when you did the play

20:44.994 --> 20:48.164
and everyone thought

20:44.994 --> 20:48.164
you were<i> so</i> cute?

20:48.206 --> 20:50.416
No, that was fine.

20:50.457 --> 20:52.960
Until one of

20:50.457 --> 20:52.960
the<i> so</i> cute sisters

20:53.002 --> 20:54.628
ruined everything again.

20:57.131 --> 20:58.424
Ah, buddy.

20:59.550 --> 21:02.220
It's tough

20:59.550 --> 21:02.220
being the oldest

21:02.261 --> 21:04.388
but you can't

21:02.261 --> 21:04.388
overlook the benefits.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.099
I mean,

21:04.430 --> 21:06.099
you get everything new.

21:06.140 --> 21:07.391
No hand-me-downs.

21:07.433 --> 21:08.893
And you get to do

21:07.433 --> 21:08.893
everything first.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.561
That's right, date.

21:10.603 --> 21:11.771
Drive.

21:11.812 --> 21:12.855
You're the first

21:11.812 --> 21:12.855
to be admitted

21:12.897 --> 21:14.982
to an R-rated picture.

21:15.024 --> 21:17.401
Without a parent or

21:15.024 --> 21:17.401
a legal guardian, huh?

21:18.194 --> 21:19.737
But the best part is..

21:20.821 --> 21:22.698
...you got two little sisters..

21:22.740 --> 21:25.201
...who need you

21:22.740 --> 21:25.201
and look up to you.

21:26.202 --> 21:28.662
And love you very,

21:26.202 --> 21:28.662
very much.

21:31.207 --> 21:32.541
(Joey)

21:31.207 --> 21:32.541
'So what do you think?'

21:32.583 --> 21:35.544
Should we light

21:32.583 --> 21:35.544
the torches, find the beast

21:35.586 --> 21:37.421
and drive her

21:35.586 --> 21:37.421
into the darkness?

21:38.714 --> 21:41.092
[chuckles]

21:38.714 --> 21:41.092
I guess not.

21:41.134 --> 21:43.928
But if we did, I'd still

21:41.134 --> 21:43.928
have one little sister left.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.972
- 'Aah!'

21:43.970 --> 21:45.972
- Noogie!

21:49.475 --> 21:50.977
Hello, information?

21:51.018 --> 21:53.229
I need to talk to Mr. Boat.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.985
Mr. Oat Boat.

21:59.026 --> 22:00.778
I need to talk to Mr. Boat.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.196
I can't do his commercial.

22:02.238 --> 22:05.449
His cereal is tearing

22:02.238 --> 22:05.449
my family apart.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.534
Steph, I need to talk to you.

22:07.576 --> 22:10.079
My sister's here.

22:07.576 --> 22:10.079
Can I put you on hold?

22:11.831 --> 22:12.957
Hello?

22:14.125 --> 22:15.668
Hello?

22:16.836 --> 22:18.087
How rude.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.677
I'm sorry,

22:22.675 --> 22:24.677
I stole your part.

22:24.718 --> 22:26.679
You didn't steal it

22:24.718 --> 22:26.679
on purpose.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.639
You didn't know

22:26.720 --> 22:28.639
what you were doing.

22:28.681 --> 22:29.682
That's true.

22:29.723 --> 22:32.018
I never know

22:29.723 --> 22:32.018
what I'm doing.

22:32.059 --> 22:34.728
But you were right

22:32.059 --> 22:34.728
about one thing.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.689
I was a little jealous.

22:36.730 --> 22:39.942
That's okay.

22:36.730 --> 22:39.942
I'm always jealous of you.

22:39.984 --> 22:42.069
- Really?

22:39.984 --> 22:42.069
- Uh-huh.

22:42.111 --> 22:44.571
That's why I follow you around

22:42.111 --> 22:44.571
and bug you.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.115
I think

22:44.613 --> 22:46.115
you're the smartest

22:46.157 --> 22:48.534
prettiest, funnest girl I know.

22:49.327 --> 22:51.204
Except when you hate me.

22:52.579 --> 22:54.414
I don't wanna hate you.

22:54.456 --> 22:56.209
I was just mad at you

22:56.250 --> 22:59.170
and someday I'll probably

22:56.250 --> 22:59.170
be mad at you again.

22:59.212 --> 23:00.213
Can you tell me when

23:00.254 --> 23:02.089
so I can go

23:00.254 --> 23:02.089
visit grandma?

23:02.131 --> 23:04.675
[chuckling]

23:04.717 --> 23:06.177
That was funny, Steph.

23:07.928 --> 23:09.680
Well, I know the rule is

23:09.722 --> 23:12.058
you have to love

23:09.722 --> 23:12.058
your little sister

23:12.099 --> 23:14.310
but even if you were

23:12.099 --> 23:14.310
some strange little kid

23:14.352 --> 23:17.980
who lived in my room,

23:14.352 --> 23:17.980
I'd love you anyways.

23:18.022 --> 23:19.857
You're my best friend.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.902
Really? I'm your best friend?

23:22.943 --> 23:24.237
Yep.

23:24.278 --> 23:26.947
Well, that works out great

23:24.278 --> 23:26.947
because you're mine.

23:33.371 --> 23:35.248
But do we

23:33.371 --> 23:35.248
really need Michelle?

23:35.289 --> 23:36.456
[laughing]

23:36.498 --> 23:38.251
Yeah, you'll

23:36.498 --> 23:38.251
like her better

23:38.292 --> 23:40.378
when she's old enough

23:38.292 --> 23:40.378
to push around.

23:40.418 --> 23:41.670
Now let's work

23:40.418 --> 23:41.670
on that script.

23:41.712 --> 23:42.963
Okay.

23:43.005 --> 23:44.090
Okay.

23:44.131 --> 23:46.259
Ladies first.

23:46.300 --> 23:47.634
Now, where it says here

23:47.676 --> 23:49.427
'"Stephanie takes

23:47.676 --> 23:49.427
heaping spoonful"'

23:49.469 --> 23:51.222
- 'Uh-huh.'

23:49.469 --> 23:51.222
- You don't need to say that.

23:51.264 --> 23:54.267
- You just do it.

23:51.264 --> 23:54.267
- No!

23:55.309 --> 23:57.144
- Yeah.

23:55.309 --> 23:57.144
- Wow.

23:57.186 --> 23:58.896
This acting is tough.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.232
I wonder if Yogi Bear

23:58.938 --> 24:01.232
had this kind of trouble.
