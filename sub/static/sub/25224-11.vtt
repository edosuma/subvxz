01:04.920 --> 01:06.520
Live from Raleigh,

01:06.600 --> 01:10.360
WRAL News in High Definition
starts right now.

01:10.440 --> 01:13.840
Since the first phone call was made
back in 2001,

01:13.920 --> 01:16.400
that's when Kathleen Peterson
was found dead

01:16.480 --> 01:19.800
at the bottom of the couple's staircase
at their home in Durham.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.800
Two years later,
Mike Peterson was convicted of murder.

01:23.320 --> 01:24.920
And for the next few years,

01:25.000 --> 01:27.840
he served time
in prisons around the state,

01:28.160 --> 01:30.600
and then he was released from prison.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.080
At the time he was,

01:32.160 --> 01:35.280
it was done so
because the judge had ordered a new trial.

01:35.360 --> 01:38.600
And at that time,
he was ordered to wear an ankle bracelet

01:38.680 --> 01:41.240
and remain on house arrest in Durham.

01:41.320 --> 01:43.400
But all of that changed today,

01:43.480 --> 01:47.080
and WRAL's Julia Sims
joins us live from Durham

01:47.160 --> 01:49.160
with the reasons why. Julia?

01:50.240 --> 01:53.200
David, Mike Peterson
wore that ankle bracelet

01:53.280 --> 01:56.840
for 937 days-- about two and a half years.

01:57.160 --> 02:00.480
It was taken off shortly after
he walked out of court today,

02:00.720 --> 02:04.680
but not before Kathleen Peterson's sisters
put up a fight.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.280
Defense attorneys asked the judge

02:06.360 --> 02:08.280
to change Peterson's bond conditions.

02:08.560 --> 02:10.320
A pre-trial supervisor testified

02:10.400 --> 02:14.000
that nearly three years
of the electronic bracelet was unheard of.

02:14.080 --> 02:17.360
I don't believe that we've had anyone
on electronic monitoring this long.

02:17.440 --> 02:20.480
Kathleen Peterson's sisters
pleaded with the judge.

02:20.560 --> 02:22.040
They called him a flight risk.

02:22.120 --> 02:27.080
Because he knows what prison tastes like,
smells like, feels like.

02:27.160 --> 02:29.080
He knows what his life will be like there.

02:29.160 --> 02:32.000
And I am sure he is--
I don't know this for a fact,

02:32.080 --> 02:34.600
but I'm sure he's got to be saying,
"I'm never going back there."

02:34.680 --> 02:38.080
I find him
a very dangerous man.

02:38.840 --> 02:41.640
He's been a proven danger to my family,
I've lost one sister.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.320
I don't want to lose another.

02:43.400 --> 02:46.680
This monitoring is the only way
we get peace

02:46.760 --> 02:49.640
and some semblance of security at night.

02:49.720 --> 02:51.720
The judge agreed
with Peterson's attorneys,

02:51.800 --> 02:55.200
releasing him from house arrest,
doing away with the ankle monitor.

02:55.280 --> 02:58.880
He ordered the 70-year-old
to stay away from his late wife's family.

02:59.360 --> 03:02.520
Peterson's attorney said the decision
was a long time coming.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.800
We look forward to a day,

03:04.880 --> 03:07.240
not in the distant future,

03:07.320 --> 03:09.800
when Michael will be
exonerated completely.

03:22.160 --> 03:26.720
When I got out,
I would sit here by myself,

03:27.160 --> 03:31.440
and... because I had all this new room
that I didn't have before.

03:31.520 --> 03:34.560
I could walk from room to room,
and I could do what I want.

03:34.640 --> 03:37.400
And everything...

03:37.480 --> 03:39.120
It was so emotionally powerful,

03:39.200 --> 03:43.040
I would cry over anything, music!

03:43.120 --> 03:46.520
I remember once,
when Patty and I when to a ballet,

03:46.960 --> 03:50.480
and it was-- they were dancing to Bach.

03:50.920 --> 03:52.200
Or maybe it was Verdi.

03:52.280 --> 03:55.240
In any case, I was crying and...

03:56.360 --> 03:57.680
Thank God it was dark.

03:57.760 --> 04:01.920
And I realized
everything was making me cry.

04:02.360 --> 04:06.000
And so I went to see
the head psychiatrist of the VA,

04:06.480 --> 04:10.440
and he says,
"Well, what do you want me to do?"

04:10.840 --> 04:13.720
And I said,
"Well, I want you to unfuck my head!

04:13.800 --> 04:16.440
I-- I don't know
what's wrong with me!"

04:16.519 --> 04:19.279
He said, "Are you suicidal?"
I said, "No."

04:19.360 --> 04:21.360
He said, "Are you...

04:22.800 --> 04:23.800
depressed?"

04:23.880 --> 04:26.040
I said, "No, I don't think so."

04:26.560 --> 04:28.440
He said,
"Well, I don't know what I can do."

04:28.520 --> 04:32.160
He said,
"Maybe you should join a group."

04:32.240 --> 04:34.200
Group. Grief.

04:34.280 --> 04:36.560
A group for anger.

04:36.640 --> 04:37.960
And I said, "No."

04:38.040 --> 04:41.120
No, I was--
I spent eight years in a group of anger,

04:41.200 --> 04:44.760
a group of, uh... grief.

04:44.840 --> 04:47.840
All these guys, hundreds of them.
I don't need that.

04:48.160 --> 04:49.920
He said, "Well, what's the problem?"

04:50.000 --> 04:52.160
I said, "I'm crying all the time."

04:53.000 --> 04:55.800
And he said, "Well, go ahead and cry."

04:57.040 --> 04:59.400
And I...

04:59.480 --> 05:01.920
I was really pissed. I really was angry.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.160
And I said, "Well, thanks."
And I got up and walked out.

05:05.680 --> 05:09.680
And for about two days I was thinking,
"What an asshole."

05:10.040 --> 05:12.160
Uh, and then I realized...

05:12.680 --> 05:14.640
he was right! That was it.

05:15.120 --> 05:18.240
That was all I needed,
that would be my catharsis.

05:18.680 --> 05:23.120
And crying for not so much
what I had lost,

05:23.200 --> 05:25.560
which was, you know, my father,
you know, I couldn't--

05:25.640 --> 05:29.240
I missed all my kids' marriages
and graduations,

05:29.600 --> 05:33.200
but also the idea
that I would never have any of that back.

05:33.280 --> 05:35.760
And then suddenly, it came back.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.640
There was art, and there was beauty,
there was music,

05:38.720 --> 05:40.880
and there were my children,
there was love.

05:41.160 --> 05:43.360
And all of that just swept over me.

05:43.880 --> 05:46.440
And I realized...

05:47.440 --> 05:49.040
that there was a two-part thing:

05:49.120 --> 05:53.560
what I lost, but also what I had regained.

05:53.960 --> 05:58.360
And so, yeah, I still cry all the time.
Silly little things will just...

05:59.160 --> 06:01.160
make-- you know,
get me to tear up.

06:01.240 --> 06:02.840
And, um...

06:05.000 --> 06:07.560
that didn't happen after Vietnam.

06:07.640 --> 06:10.440
But then Vietnam was just one year.
This was eight years.

06:10.880 --> 06:11.920
And much more...

06:13.320 --> 06:14.440
much more intense.

06:14.520 --> 06:19.440
War, as everybody knows, or says,
it's 90 percent boredom,

06:19.920 --> 06:22.160
and then ten percent action and terror.

06:22.240 --> 06:24.520
And that's, uh, prison is...

06:25.560 --> 06:31.280
a little bit a higher percentage of action
and terror.

06:41.680 --> 06:43.600
Mr. Peterson is indigent.

06:43.960 --> 06:47.160
He can't afford to hire his own counselor
as regard to this,

06:47.240 --> 06:50.400
so we'd ask the Court
to set the wheels in motion

06:50.480 --> 06:53.240
so that counsel
can be appointed for him.

06:53.600 --> 06:56.720
I've spoken with Mr. Maher
about that and...

06:57.240 --> 07:00.600
I'm gonna remain involved in the case
in one capacity or another,

07:00.680 --> 07:04.440
but I think for purposes
of moving the case along,

07:04.520 --> 07:07.880
we should probably have that process
started at this point.

07:08.520 --> 07:10.360
- That motion is allowed.
- Thank you.

07:16.880 --> 07:20.000
Do you solemny swear the answers
that you've given on this information

07:20.080 --> 07:22.400
is true and correct
to the best of your knowledge?

07:22.480 --> 07:23.320
I do.

07:32.200 --> 07:35.160
Your Honor, Mr. Peterson
has filled out and sworn to the affidavit.

07:35.240 --> 07:37.160
And, uh, may we be excused?

07:37.720 --> 07:39.240
Going down.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.840
Second floor.

07:47.680 --> 07:50.800
But wouldn't it be more efficient
and cost effective for the State

07:50.880 --> 07:52.040
if you were that court--?

07:52.120 --> 07:55.600
I think that would be a fair--
uh, a fair assumption.

07:55.680 --> 07:58.720
I know a lot about the case.
I've been through it once, so...

07:58.800 --> 08:01.080
But that's-- that's something
that will be up to Tom Maher

08:01.160 --> 08:04.000
and I'm certainly not gonna try
to interfere with that process.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.160
If you chose that direction,
that option is open?

08:06.240 --> 08:07.320
I could do that, yeah.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.080
The case never made sense to me.

08:09.160 --> 08:14.720
Michael has been absolutely, uh,
insistent from the day I met him

08:14.800 --> 08:16.600
that he had absolutely nothing
to do with this

08:16.680 --> 08:18.640
and I believe that that's the case.

08:18.720 --> 08:21.560
I do not believe
that Michael Peterson had anything to do

08:21.640 --> 08:23.200
with Kathleen Peterson's death.

08:23.280 --> 08:26.080
Are you trying to work
on a plea? I understand you are.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.160
You've been talking.

08:27.520 --> 08:30.800
Well, I think, in any case,
you always explore the alternatives

08:30.880 --> 08:34.440
before you throw down the gauntlet,
and, uh, and go back to trial.

08:34.520 --> 08:37.840
So I think it would only be reasonable
for everybody to sort of sit back

08:37.919 --> 08:41.280
and reassess where we are
and where things should go.

08:41.360 --> 08:42.240
Um...

08:42.320 --> 08:45.040
And that's just a sort of normal process.

08:45.120 --> 08:46.080
- Thank you.
- Okay.

08:46.160 --> 08:47.720
- Thank you.
- See you guys.

09:05.120 --> 09:09.720
Whether or not the case will be resolved
by a plea agreement,

09:09.800 --> 09:12.640
we don't know that... yet.

09:13.360 --> 09:16.120
I took office as District Attorney

09:16.200 --> 09:18.360
in Durham County, North Carolina

09:18.720 --> 09:21.400
on September 1, 2014,

09:21.480 --> 09:23.560
which is not quite two weeks ago.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.440
The court system or justice system

09:26.520 --> 09:30.480
has-- has been put to work greatly
in this particular case,

09:30.560 --> 09:33.520
and I don't know that, um,

09:33.600 --> 09:37.640
there's-- there's a failure,
um, of the system

09:37.720 --> 09:39.960
because it's-- it's not over.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.600
Um, it may be a sign that the--

09:43.680 --> 09:46.600
that the system is working

09:46.680 --> 09:52.440
because it's affording the defendant
every right.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.560
Anytime you have a serious case,

09:54.640 --> 09:59.200
particularly a case where you speaking
to a family and their loved one

09:59.720 --> 10:01.920
or-- or good friend,

10:02.400 --> 10:03.920
sometimes both, of course,

10:04.000 --> 10:07.200
many-- most times, both, has been killed.

10:07.560 --> 10:12.000
You know, we're talking about parents,
children, siblings.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.160
Um...

10:16.200 --> 10:18.480
That family really wants--
really wants justice.

10:18.560 --> 10:22.400
We can't expect Roger Echols
as the new DA...

10:23.360 --> 10:26.520
to come in--
and I told Michael this-- and say,

10:27.120 --> 10:30.680
"We're sorry,
you should have never been prosecuted.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.760
I don't know what Jim Hardin,

10:32.840 --> 10:35.680
our Resident Superior Court Judge
was thinking,

10:36.360 --> 10:40.000
um, and we're not gonna proceed
with this case."

10:40.080 --> 10:41.120
I mean, that...

10:41.200 --> 10:44.320
if that was the alternative
available to him,

10:44.400 --> 10:47.160
then he would commit
the resources that he needed

10:47.240 --> 10:49.440
and he'd rather let a jury

10:50.400 --> 10:55.400
take the heat
by finding Michael not guilty.

10:55.480 --> 10:58.560
So, you know, Michael's, um...

10:58.960 --> 11:05.760
Michael's wishes, uh,
just didn't comport with reality,

11:06.360 --> 11:08.600
with what happens in the real world.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.400
And so what I said to him was,

11:10.480 --> 11:12.840
"Michael, you know,
if that's what you want,

11:12.920 --> 11:14.720
you know, you're not gonna get that.

11:15.200 --> 11:20.600
So, you know, you're gonna need to find
somebody to help you go to trial again,

11:20.680 --> 11:24.560
um, because that's the position
you're gonna put Roger in.

11:25.240 --> 11:28.520
Uh, and it doesn't make sense to me
for you to do that.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.160
You're 71 years old.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.440
You've been through the wringer.

11:32.520 --> 11:35.040
Uh, you know, it's broken you financially,

11:35.120 --> 11:36.560
it's broken you health-wise.

11:36.640 --> 11:40.000
I mean, he looks
like a completely different person

11:40.520 --> 11:44.240
uh, than he looked like back in 2001.

11:44.760 --> 11:47.720
And not just from natural aging.
I mean, you know...

11:48.200 --> 11:51.360
Uh, it's sort of shocking

11:51.440 --> 11:56.480
when you look back at the video of him
during the trial

11:56.560 --> 11:57.920
and you look at it now.

11:58.680 --> 12:01.640
Uh, he's-- he's become a very old man.

12:02.000 --> 12:02.880
Uh...

12:03.440 --> 12:05.080
In-- in a decade.

12:05.160 --> 12:09.320
Um, and what's the point?

12:24.280 --> 12:26.320
What's that? Wanna play?

12:29.600 --> 12:32.200
You're almost there, you're almost there!
Come on, come on, come on.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.600
One, two...

12:52.520 --> 12:54.200
Just jump. Come on, kid!

12:56.760 --> 12:58.520
- I have to pee.
- Off you go.

13:05.440 --> 13:06.960
- Hey, Michael.
- Hey, David, how are you?

13:07.040 --> 13:08.440
I'm good. Sit, sit, sit.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.040
Good.

13:10.520 --> 13:11.440
Are you all right?

13:11.520 --> 13:13.360
Well, I don't know.
Tell me, am I all right?

13:13.440 --> 13:15.240
- I think you're all right.
-

13:15.640 --> 13:16.520
So...

13:16.600 --> 13:17.520
Here's where we are.

13:17.600 --> 13:18.760
- The case can be resolved.
- Oh!

13:19.280 --> 13:22.120
- With my death or...
-

13:22.200 --> 13:23.360
...something less?

13:23.720 --> 13:25.320
- Probably something less.
-

13:25.400 --> 13:27.880
Uh, death would do it, but...

13:27.960 --> 13:30.400
Hey, it's an option.
I'm thinking, you know.

13:30.480 --> 13:31.840
Um, all right, so...

13:31.920 --> 13:35.160
First is, you know, what's the charge
that will resolve this?

13:35.240 --> 13:36.600
- That's one variable.
- Okay.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.480
Uh, second variable is,

13:38.560 --> 13:41.920
what's the sentence
that would resolve this?

13:42.000 --> 13:42.840
Right.

13:42.920 --> 13:47.720
And the third is, what's the nature
of what you say in court?

13:47.800 --> 13:50.720
You know, and obviously,
there are three variables there.

13:51.040 --> 13:55.280
There is the guilty plea,
there is the no contest plea,

13:55.360 --> 13:57.280
- and there is the Alford plea.
- Okay.

13:57.360 --> 14:00.160
When you do an Alford plea,
you actually say...

14:00.240 --> 14:01.360
- "I'm innocent."
- No.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.840
What you say is, "I'm pleading guilty,

14:04.160 --> 14:09.000
but I am not pleading guilty
because I did this.

14:09.600 --> 14:13.560
I'm pleading guilty
because I'm 72 years old,

14:13.840 --> 14:17.920
I've already served, you know,
eight and a half years in prison.

14:18.320 --> 14:21.160
Uh, I went through a five-month trial.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.480
Uh, all of my resources are depleted,

14:24.720 --> 14:27.080
I can't go through this again,

14:27.160 --> 14:32.120
and so, to put this behind us,
I'm entering this plea."

14:32.200 --> 14:33.320
That's an Alford plea.

14:33.400 --> 14:34.960
I thought Alford was...

14:35.240 --> 14:39.640
I am pleading guilty
because for whatever...

14:39.720 --> 14:41.440
- I'm 71, by the way.
- Sorry.

14:41.520 --> 14:44.240
It's all right, that's not important.
And, uh...

14:45.160 --> 14:46.440
but I'm innocent.

14:46.840 --> 14:48.880
But I'm-- but I'm accepting this

14:48.960 --> 14:52.200
- because the prosecution has evidence...
- Yes, yes.

14:52.280 --> 14:53.720
...they could retrial me.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.600
- I could get fucked again...
- Yes.

14:55.680 --> 14:59.760
...uh, in those very words or, uh...

15:00.480 --> 15:03.440
- But I thought the innocence was up the--
- You can say that. No, you know,

15:03.520 --> 15:05.760
and you can say that, yeah, no...

15:05.840 --> 15:08.520
- But you're entering a plea.
- I understand.

15:08.600 --> 15:13.040
It goes on as guilty
as "a convicted felon, I am guilty."

15:13.120 --> 15:15.080
Right, no, I understand that, so...

15:15.160 --> 15:16.640
I got that. Okay.

15:16.720 --> 15:18.760
If somebody said to me,

15:19.640 --> 15:24.240
"Okay, we are going to retrial you

15:24.320 --> 15:26.880
and you are going to go through
all this smear again

15:26.960 --> 15:28.400
and we'll say all this terrible shit,

15:28.480 --> 15:31.200
and all this horrible stuff's gonna
happen, gonna happen, gonna happen.

15:31.280 --> 15:35.640
And at the end,
you're really found not guilty,

15:35.720 --> 15:38.000
and you get to go home
and everything will be fine."

15:38.360 --> 15:39.520
I'd say, "Go ahead,

15:39.600 --> 15:42.000
beat me up for the next two years.
I don't give a shit.

15:42.080 --> 15:44.240
Go ahead and say anything you want,
I don't care."

15:44.560 --> 15:47.000
But you and I know

15:47.600 --> 15:50.840
that may not be the result
of two years of trial.

15:50.920 --> 15:54.400
It could well be, "Oh, well,
you're guilty again," and off I go.

15:54.480 --> 15:57.880
Whether it's an Alford plea,
a no-contest plea, or a guilty plea,

15:57.960 --> 16:00.360
is that to second degree?

16:00.720 --> 16:04.800
Or is it to, uh--
to voluntary manslaughter?

16:04.880 --> 16:09.360
Voluntary is a weird sort of crime
in North Carolina.

16:09.440 --> 16:16.040
Basically, it's where you have
a second-degree situation

16:16.120 --> 16:20.880
but the person is acting out of emotion.

16:20.960 --> 16:24.880
So, for example, you walk into a room,

16:24.960 --> 16:27.640
you find your wife in bed
with another man,

16:28.000 --> 16:33.720
uh, you, you know, you lose it,
you kill the wife, or the man, or both.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.720
Uh, so, you're acting
under the heat of passion.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.600
And I guess voluntary manslaughter
could make sense

16:40.680 --> 16:45.640
if you believe that whatever
Kathleen allegedly found or did...

16:45.720 --> 16:47.640
- Right.
- ...you know, created in you,

16:47.720 --> 16:48.840
you know, some...

16:48.920 --> 16:51.360
You know, this is all--
we're now in the realm of fiction.

16:51.440 --> 16:53.280
- I got that. It's okay. I got it.
- Yeah.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.760
- I can go with that.
- Okay.

16:54.840 --> 16:59.000
I'm here to give you the options,
but at the end of the day,

16:59.080 --> 17:02.840
it's your life, and you need to live it
how you wanna live it.

17:02.920 --> 17:03.920
The murder...

17:04.640 --> 17:09.640
I would really like to avoid
at all possibilities.

17:09.720 --> 17:14.040
I would prefer, obviously, manslaughter...
Oh, God, am I saying this?

17:14.119 --> 17:16.280
Manslaughter over murder,

17:16.760 --> 17:20.440
um, and I'm not going back to prison.

17:20.920 --> 17:21.760
Right.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.960
And what I say at the end of that,

17:25.319 --> 17:26.599
for my own self,

17:26.680 --> 17:30.080
in self-respect and self-esteem,
for my kids and for everybody else.

17:30.480 --> 17:34.960
I cannot say,
"I am guilty of killing Kathleen."

17:35.040 --> 17:36.360
I just can't do that.

17:36.440 --> 17:37.440
I understand.

17:37.800 --> 17:41.440
So one deal breaker is,
if there is any possibility

17:41.840 --> 17:45.360
that you'd have to go back in
for any amount of time.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.440
- Right.
- Right?

17:46.520 --> 17:47.360
Correct.

17:47.440 --> 17:51.880
Second deal breaker is,
if you had to say you're pleading guilty

17:51.960 --> 17:53.120
because you are guilty.

17:53.480 --> 17:54.480
- Correct.
- Okay.

17:54.560 --> 17:56.400
- All right.
- Okay.

17:56.760 --> 17:57.880
You've gotten shorter.

17:58.360 --> 18:00.600
You keep saying that and it's not true.

18:00.680 --> 18:01.520
Look at this.

18:01.600 --> 18:05.600
- We used to be the same height, right?
- That I'm fucking alive is amazing, right?

18:06.520 --> 18:08.160
Let me help you with this one.

18:10.120 --> 18:12.160
- All right, Michael.
- Okay, I appreciate it.

18:12.240 --> 18:13.200
- Thank you.
- All right.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.680
Yeah, so after you guys leave, uh...

18:38.760 --> 18:44.720
Clayton, Becky, Dorian, and Lucian
are coming for my birthday next week.

18:45.080 --> 18:48.000
They always come.
Uh, and then they go to the state fair.

18:49.240 --> 18:50.440
And that'll be nice.

18:50.520 --> 18:54.280
I mean, it'll be really nice to have
Clayton and Becky and the kids here.

18:54.360 --> 18:55.280
So...

18:57.240 --> 19:01.640
Yeah, and then, it will be over,
I hope, this whole thing.

19:08.440 --> 19:09.280
David!

19:09.960 --> 19:11.240
Hey, Michael, how are you?

19:11.320 --> 19:13.280
This is my happy birthday call, right?

19:14.080 --> 19:17.000
No, this is your Roger Echols call.

19:18.200 --> 19:22.120
I spoke with Roger, uh, yesterday,

19:22.200 --> 19:25.880
and despite what I thought
was a pretty good chance

19:25.960 --> 19:28.080
that we would be able
to settle this thing,

19:28.400 --> 19:34.240
he will not agree to the resolution
that we proposed with the Alford plea.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.680
He spoke with...

19:37.760 --> 19:40.680
Candace and Lori,
and I suppose Caitlin.

19:41.320 --> 19:46.080
Uh, and the family
will not agree to anything

19:46.160 --> 19:49.120
that does not involve you completely,

19:49.200 --> 19:52.320
in essence, accepting responsibility,
pleading guilty.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.920
Um you know, not an Alford plea.

19:55.600 --> 20:00.280
Uh, and, uh, he's not gonna go
along with it against their wishes.

20:00.360 --> 20:02.800
No Alford plea?
Let me see I got this right.

20:02.880 --> 20:06.720
They want me to stand up in court
and say, "I'm guilty," right?

20:07.160 --> 20:08.000
That's it.

20:08.400 --> 20:12.080
And-- and he knows
that's never going to happen, right?

20:12.160 --> 20:14.680
Uh, I told him that right from the start.

20:14.760 --> 20:17.720
So he understands,
and what he said to me was,

20:17.800 --> 20:20.080
"So I guess we're going to trial."

20:20.160 --> 20:22.640
And I said,
"I guess that's what's gonna happen."

20:22.720 --> 20:24.600
So, that's where we are, Mike.

20:24.680 --> 20:26.320
But this was pretty much...

20:26.720 --> 20:29.120
Well, I think you texted me
that this was gonna happen, right?

20:29.200 --> 20:31.040
You really thought there would be...

20:32.160 --> 20:34.880
an agreement,
a deal on the Alford plea, right?

20:35.680 --> 20:36.920
I thought there would be

20:37.000 --> 20:42.200
because it's not in Roger Echols'
own interest to go to trial.

20:42.280 --> 20:45.360
He sort of indicated that
when we spoke last.

20:45.880 --> 20:49.520
Uh, but he's simply not willing
to do anything

20:49.600 --> 20:53.600
that Kathleen's family will not agree to.

20:53.680 --> 20:56.920
So, and by "Kathleen's family,"
he's talking about his--

20:57.400 --> 20:59.200
her sisters and her daughter.

20:59.280 --> 21:03.080
So Candace and Lori are running this show,
not Roger Echols, right?

21:04.160 --> 21:07.320
Well, essentially.
At least, as far as this goes.

21:07.400 --> 21:11.400
So, listen, we need to talk,
because as I told you before

21:11.480 --> 21:15.840
I was happy to try to negotiate
a resolution to this thing,

21:15.920 --> 21:17.800
uh, but if that's not gonna happen,

21:18.160 --> 21:22.200
you know, I told you,
I just can't retry this case.

21:22.280 --> 21:27.040
Uh, and so, I want to-- I want to, uh...

21:27.880 --> 21:29.560
Bail!

21:31.320 --> 21:33.800
- Hello?
- Yeah, I said you wanna bail out of this.

21:35.160 --> 21:36.200
Uh...

21:36.280 --> 21:40.160
No, no, I don't want to bail out
of this but, you know, I told you

21:40.240 --> 21:43.120
that I just couldn't take on
this trial again.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.600
Uh, not after all these years.

21:44.680 --> 21:48.600
And I'm now in Charlotte, you know,
I'm just in a different place.

21:48.680 --> 21:49.760
- So...
-

21:49.840 --> 21:53.680
Uh, I've spoken to a lawyer
by the name of Mike Klinkosum.

21:53.760 --> 21:57.240
He's in Raleigh.
He's a very, very fine lawyer.

21:57.720 --> 22:01.360
Uh, he is the person
who got Greg Taylor out.

22:01.440 --> 22:06.040
Um, as for me, I just can't commit
to doing another one of these trials.

22:06.680 --> 22:09.880
Okay, um...

22:10.120 --> 22:13.000
And the reason being because...

22:15.880 --> 22:17.000
Why?

22:18.800 --> 22:22.760
Because the last one was crushing,
uh, as you know.

22:23.000 --> 22:28.080
Um, not just for you and your family,
but for me.

22:28.760 --> 22:35.200
Uh, and I succeeded in what my goal
has been for the last ten years,

22:35.280 --> 22:38.120
which was to get you a new trial.

22:38.440 --> 22:39.320
Um...

22:39.800 --> 22:41.880
And, uh...

22:42.240 --> 22:43.600
um, um...

22:44.040 --> 22:48.240
I'm just exhausted
with the pressure of this case.

22:48.320 --> 22:50.440
-
- Uh, and...

22:51.280 --> 22:53.520
I just think for everybody's sake,

22:53.600 --> 22:56.400
uh, a new set of eyes
is probably a good idea.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.040
And I can't get you to change your mind?

23:03.800 --> 23:06.440
I don't think so, Mike.
I mean, I've thought about this a lot.

23:06.520 --> 23:07.960
Uh...

23:08.040 --> 23:10.560
I just thought we'd be able
to settle it and we're not.

23:10.640 --> 23:15.720
And best case, uh, this might go on
for a couple more years, right?

23:17.280 --> 23:21.760
I would say...
yeah, a year and half to two years.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.800
A minimum of a year, you know,

23:25.200 --> 23:27.160
somewhere between a year and two years.

23:29.200 --> 23:31.680
Okay, David, all right. Um...

23:31.760 --> 23:34.280
I'm gonna have Mike Klinkosum call you.

23:34.920 --> 23:37.200
Uh, please meet with him.

23:37.280 --> 23:41.800
Uh, ask him
as much as you want to ask him.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.040
Uh...

23:43.120 --> 23:46.080
You know, get a feel for him,
and then let's you and I talk.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.400
Okay.

23:49.160 --> 23:51.280
- All right, David, okay.
- All right? Okay.

23:51.560 --> 23:52.600
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

23:57.640 --> 23:59.200
Fuck!

24:00.280 --> 24:02.040
Oh, shit!

24:03.320 --> 24:06.480
It's 2014, October,

24:07.200 --> 24:09.640
and I'm back basically to...

24:12.120 --> 24:14.080
2001.

24:15.160 --> 24:19.720
When Kathleen died.
We're starting all over again.

24:27.640 --> 24:30.040
Pfft...

24:31.440 --> 24:33.080
I wonder if I'll live that long.

24:33.880 --> 24:35.560
I think that's their plan, basically,

24:35.640 --> 24:38.920
is they hope I'm gonna die
before this damn thing comes to an end.

24:39.680 --> 24:42.280
But guess what? I'm not, so...

24:43.040 --> 24:45.720
Well, I get it.
I can't do anything about it.

24:45.800 --> 24:49.440
I understand. I do understand David, uh...

24:50.400 --> 24:51.520
But I just thought...

24:52.120 --> 24:55.800
I mean, my God, we could end this today.

24:55.880 --> 25:00.720
You know, "Hey, okay, Mike is going
to take a felony conviction.

25:00.800 --> 25:06.200
All he asks is he doesn't have
to stand up in court and say,

25:06.480 --> 25:08.440
"I killed Kathleen." Because I didn't.

25:08.520 --> 25:12.000
And I never am going to say that.
Ever, ever, ever.

25:12.680 --> 25:15.800
So we go to trial.
We're back from the-- to the beginning.

25:16.360 --> 25:17.200
That's it.

25:36.480 --> 25:40.560
Mike Klinkosum
did just a tremendous job

25:40.640 --> 25:41.920
gathering new information,

25:42.000 --> 25:46.320
finding things that had been overlooked,
let's say, in the original case.

25:47.160 --> 25:51.600
Now we find out that all the evidence
was contaminated.

25:51.680 --> 25:52.800
The bags were ripped open.

25:52.880 --> 25:55.800
I have no idea who did it,
I don't know why they did it,

25:55.880 --> 25:57.120
or maybe just...

25:58.120 --> 25:59.080
What?

25:59.160 --> 26:01.640
Uh, incompetence, no idea.

26:02.080 --> 26:04.120
But what it does
is prevents any testing now.

26:05.200 --> 26:09.880
And then Mike found out
that Kathleen's clothes were never tested.

26:10.280 --> 26:13.400
There was no DNA testing
on her clothing at all.

26:14.320 --> 26:19.240
That was for Mike,
a major, major discovery.

26:19.920 --> 26:23.200
So, Mike said,
"There needs to be a dismissal."

26:23.680 --> 26:26.720
And I would very much like...
I'd like to go back to trial!

26:27.400 --> 26:30.280
Uh, to be exonerated,

26:30.680 --> 26:33.800
uh, for a total not-guilty plea
to come in.

26:33.880 --> 26:35.960
Let the jury hear the real evidence,

26:36.040 --> 26:41.120
let it happen now without the lies,
the perjury, the contamination.

26:41.720 --> 26:43.440
But I don't think that can happen.

26:43.520 --> 26:49.040
So I think the best that's going to happen
is that the district attorney

26:49.560 --> 26:52.160
will agree to dismiss it.

26:52.240 --> 26:54.160
And that will be the end of it for me.

26:54.840 --> 26:56.400
Except, of course...

26:57.400 --> 26:59.800
there will still be no exoneration.

26:59.880 --> 27:01.840
There will be no "not guilty."

27:18.440 --> 27:19.320
Hi!

27:20.320 --> 27:22.400
Hey, it's nice to see you.

27:23.120 --> 27:25.680
Okay, nice to see you and... Yep.

27:37.680 --> 27:40.520
The only thing they have
to try to prove your guilt

27:41.200 --> 27:42.960
is Kathleen's body.

27:43.520 --> 27:44.400
Right.

27:45.680 --> 27:47.040
- The clothing...
- Right.

27:47.320 --> 27:48.960
- And blood spatter.
- Right.

27:49.040 --> 27:51.360
They don't have fingerprints,
they don't have anything.

27:51.440 --> 27:54.600
- Right.
- It's totally and grossly circumstantial.

27:54.680 --> 27:55.600
Right.

27:56.080 --> 27:59.600
The police went in
with a predetermined conclusion...

27:59.680 --> 28:00.640
Right.

28:00.720 --> 28:03.120
- ...that you must have killed her.
- Right.

28:04.240 --> 28:10.080
And when Kathleen's clothes
weren't tested for other DNA...

28:10.160 --> 28:11.000
Right.

28:11.320 --> 28:15.160
...it makes the condition of the evidence
absolutely critical.

28:15.240 --> 28:16.080
Right.

28:16.160 --> 28:20.160
We went to the clerk's office,
and we had Jim and Kelly with us.

28:21.480 --> 28:23.520
There was so many boxes there.

28:23.600 --> 28:25.200
- Mm-hmm.
- We went through these boxes...

28:25.280 --> 28:26.120
Mm-hmm.

28:26.200 --> 28:27.600
...and we discovered...

28:28.880 --> 28:31.840
these bags that were ripped open.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.880
- This is the Peterson case.
- Mm-hm.

28:33.960 --> 28:35.760
You see where it's ripped there.

28:39.080 --> 28:44.280
This box contains a pair of tennis shoes
and some type of sweatshirt,

28:44.360 --> 28:47.400
garment, or something,
just as you open the box.

28:47.480 --> 28:49.960
And that one's marked
"biohazard" that's wide open?

28:50.040 --> 28:52.040
- Yeah, wide open.
- There's your biohazard.

28:52.120 --> 28:53.120
And, uh...

28:53.200 --> 28:55.200
They're in a box, just thrown in there.

28:57.080 --> 28:59.680
Some kind of hazard sticker
on there, okay.

29:01.160 --> 29:02.640
Here's another view of that.

29:03.720 --> 29:04.840
Now a close-up.

29:05.960 --> 29:08.240
Now, here's another close-up of the shoes.

29:10.120 --> 29:13.760
Here's another bag, it's identified as,
of course, the Peterson case.

29:14.880 --> 29:17.320
- Right there on that--
- Gray sweatpants.

29:17.880 --> 29:19.840
Purple sweatshirt.

29:20.280 --> 29:22.440
What was shown
in this photograph here

29:22.520 --> 29:24.720
is not necessarily the shoes,

29:25.160 --> 29:28.520
but this blue garment,
which is under the shoes,

29:28.960 --> 29:31.480
and it's not protected in a bag
or anything,

29:31.560 --> 29:34.960
it's just thrown in there,
and then the shoes are over the top of it.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.960
- Like, there it is in the box.
- Mm-hmm.

29:37.040 --> 29:40.000
Here's a close-up,
and you can see...

29:41.200 --> 29:42.680
What we think might be blood?

29:42.760 --> 29:46.440
Well, it's blood, or dirt,
or some type of debris

29:46.960 --> 29:48.880
on the front of it
in this area right here.

29:48.960 --> 29:49.800
Uh-huh.

29:49.880 --> 29:51.280
Right here, you can see that.

29:51.360 --> 29:53.000
P-D-D-P-O.

29:53.080 --> 29:55.800
And here's another bag
that's been ripped open,

29:55.880 --> 29:57.880
and opened, and opened, and opened.

29:58.520 --> 29:59.760
A ton of times.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.640
Item six, that's probably the shoes.

30:05.880 --> 30:10.680
So, we have X items that have been opened
and not resealed.

30:11.200 --> 30:15.080
We have one or two cases
intermingled in this box.

30:15.160 --> 30:16.960
There is some speculation right now

30:17.040 --> 30:20.000
that the boxes that we saw
all the evidence in

30:20.520 --> 30:26.000
were not the original storage boxes,
that they may have been moving boxes,

30:26.080 --> 30:27.840
not evidence boxes.

30:29.080 --> 30:31.440
So, who knows? They had movers there.

30:31.520 --> 30:35.040
The boxes may have been in poor condition,
the movers may have put them in.

30:35.120 --> 30:39.320
Which may have been why we have evidence
from another case thrown in there.

30:39.400 --> 30:42.840
Because I certainly doubt
that the movers would have known

30:42.920 --> 30:46.600
or understood the importance
of keeping all of the evidence.

30:47.080 --> 30:50.680
It's really not our job
to have to even prove

30:51.680 --> 30:53.720
- how she died or who did it.
- Right.

30:53.800 --> 30:58.080
But if there is some type
of exculpatory evidence on that clothing,

30:58.600 --> 31:01.000
it should have been found out. It wasn't.

31:01.080 --> 31:04.080
- [We want to find out. We can't.
- Right. Right.

31:04.160 --> 31:06.960
- Okay! I will go, all right.
- Okay. Thank you.

31:07.040 --> 31:08.520
- Jim...
- Thank you, Michael.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.080
- I will see you...? Monday!
- Monday.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.360
- All right, bye-bye.
- Bye. Drive safely.

31:12.440 --> 31:14.720
- See you Monday. Thank you.
- Have a great weekend.

31:52.480 --> 31:55.880
I mean, I have no experience in law.

31:55.960 --> 32:00.120
There's nothing that I can help out with
other than my presence to you

32:00.200 --> 32:02.080
is one thing that I felt and so...

32:02.160 --> 32:03.600
-
-

32:04.000 --> 32:06.560
So that's why I'm here.
I'm here to support Dad

32:06.640 --> 32:09.000
and to be here and to...

32:09.480 --> 32:12.200
hopefully see some resolution soon.

32:13.720 --> 32:15.440
Is this where we all cry together?

32:15.520 --> 32:18.200
- I am so emotional.
- Me too, dear.

32:18.280 --> 32:19.360
You are!

32:19.440 --> 32:20.760
I know, I know.

32:21.400 --> 32:24.120
- I know.
- I have been crying for a week.

32:24.200 --> 32:25.040
- Really?
-

32:25.120 --> 32:27.600
I've been so emotional this week, yeah.

32:27.880 --> 32:30.520
I think it's that I have a lot of friends
that are therapists,

32:30.600 --> 32:32.600
- and they're like, "How are you doing?"
-

32:32.680 --> 32:36.920
- I'm like, "Ah! I'm so anxious."
-

32:38.120 --> 32:40.120
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

32:40.200 --> 32:41.040
Yeah.

32:41.120 --> 32:43.960
I had spent so much time, like you...

32:44.840 --> 32:48.440
suppressing emotions,
and now, I am like, "Oh!"

32:48.880 --> 32:51.320
- It's just all coming out.
- I-- it's just coming out, yeah.

32:51.400 --> 32:53.200
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:53.280 --> 32:56.720
I don't know what's it gonna be like if--
when this really ends...

32:56.800 --> 32:58.720
- Oh, my gosh, yeah.
- Yeah.

32:58.800 --> 33:01.480
I used to suffer a lot
from really bad nightmares,

33:01.560 --> 33:04.400
I used to have really bad panic attacks
in public spaces

33:04.480 --> 33:06.280
because of being in the trial.

33:06.360 --> 33:08.120
My body and my whole nervous system

33:08.200 --> 33:12.000
will think that something like the trial
is happening or...

33:12.520 --> 33:15.440
um, that, you know,
if I'm losing a friend,

33:15.520 --> 33:17.040
I feel like I'm losing,

33:17.120 --> 33:19.280
like, you know,
the death of one of my parents,

33:19.360 --> 33:21.360
or something like that will come up.

33:21.440 --> 33:27.840
Um, and I have to say, "Okay, no.
That was in the past, I'm in the present.

33:28.520 --> 33:31.520
Look at me, it's 2016, you know."

33:32.160 --> 33:34.280
And just reorient myself to the present.

33:34.360 --> 33:39.320
So those are all the things
that I've had to work on, in order to...

33:40.480 --> 33:42.040
just be more whole,

33:42.120 --> 33:45.680
and have less suffering
on a daily basis, I guess.

33:45.760 --> 33:48.480
I found out that Margaret
used to have panic attacks.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.200
- Yeah.
- She couldn't go over a bridge.

33:50.280 --> 33:52.720
I don't think I've ever had
a panic attack. What is it?

33:52.800 --> 33:57.040
Um, it's this feeling
that your lungs get really tight...

33:57.440 --> 33:59.520
- um, your heart beats--
- It just comes on suddenly?

33:59.600 --> 34:01.520
Yeah. And it feels different
for each person,

34:01.600 --> 34:04.880
but for me,
it's like your heart beats faster.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.360
I can't breathe

34:06.440 --> 34:09.239
and I worry that I'm gonna pass out,
and I'm really on the close...

34:09.320 --> 34:10.880
Like, I almost pass out.

34:10.960 --> 34:12.360
So when Margaret had hers,

34:12.440 --> 34:14.040
- I mean, I was in prison.
- Yeah.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.480
And you think hers was
as a result of the trial?

34:16.840 --> 34:18.480
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Absolutely.

34:18.560 --> 34:21.840
I went on this backpacking trip, um,

34:21.920 --> 34:25.719
to a place that was above
the Rocky Mountain National Park

34:25.800 --> 34:28.320
where it was, like, the most

34:28.400 --> 34:31.760
beautiful place
I have ever been in my life,

34:32.440 --> 34:35.040
And we just, like,
went over to the summit.

34:35.120 --> 34:38.360
And you just saw the whole mountain range
on both sides.

34:38.840 --> 34:40.000
And I just started--

34:40.080 --> 34:43.000
It was so profound, um...

34:44.199 --> 34:46.120
I just started crying.

34:46.199 --> 34:49.360
And for some reason,
all I could think about was Mom.

34:49.440 --> 34:51.320
And it was like...

34:52.760 --> 34:57.400
just beautiful that I could have
that moment of, like,

34:57.920 --> 35:01.880
pure grief for her
without all the other stuff mixed up.

35:01.960 --> 35:05.600
I know this is really big, but like,
without all the,

35:06.040 --> 35:08.320
you know,
the trial mess mixed into it,

35:08.400 --> 35:10.600
and the newspapers, and stuff like that.

35:10.680 --> 35:13.040
And it was just like pure memory.

35:13.120 --> 35:14.720
- Yeah.
- And pure like...

35:14.800 --> 35:17.400
It was so beautiful,
I couldn't stop crying for like an hour.

35:39.400 --> 35:42.880
We're now to a certain extent
back to square one

35:43.640 --> 35:47.120
in the sense that
we're trying to make sense

35:47.200 --> 35:50.680
of what the physical evidence is,

35:50.760 --> 35:53.080
and what you can tell
from the physical evidence.

35:53.160 --> 35:56.560
Now I know,
and I didn't know this at the time,

35:57.200 --> 35:59.720
uh, that Susie Barker,

36:00.440 --> 36:04.840
who is the person
who does the little victory dance

36:05.360 --> 36:07.760
during Deaver's "experiments"

36:07.840 --> 36:11.680
when he gets something to work
the way he wanted it to work,

36:12.120 --> 36:15.920
that Susie Barker actually changed

36:16.520 --> 36:20.720
what the SBI was supposed to be doing
with the physical evidence.

36:21.040 --> 36:23.200
When it came to the SBI,

36:24.080 --> 36:26.680
they were supposed to be doing
DNA testing.

36:27.600 --> 36:30.280
Susie Barker crossed that out,

36:30.760 --> 36:36.800
and instead said,
"Send it to Deaver, blood spatter."

36:37.160 --> 36:40.840
Now, that had to be at Deaver's request.

36:42.480 --> 36:45.400
That had-- I mean,
that was after Deaver got involved,

36:45.480 --> 36:47.880
it was after Deaver had been in the house,

36:47.960 --> 36:50.520
it was after Deaver
had come to the conclusion

36:51.240 --> 36:54.120
that it was a homicide
that had been committed by Michael.

36:54.760 --> 36:57.440
Well, now, Deaver didn't want
any DNA testing done

36:57.760 --> 37:01.560
because that could totally
screw up his theory.

37:02.560 --> 37:07.440
So, he has Susie Barker
change what's gonna be done

37:07.840 --> 37:09.360
so that it comes to him.

37:09.880 --> 37:12.040
And now he's in total control,

37:12.120 --> 37:14.440
and he does his ridiculous experiments,

37:14.720 --> 37:17.080
and he comes into court
and commits perjury,

37:17.680 --> 37:19.520
and Michael Peterson goes to prison.

37:20.240 --> 37:24.640
And that piece of evidence
that Susie Barker and Deaver

37:25.040 --> 37:26.720
had gotten together

37:26.800 --> 37:30.480
and switched where the case was going,

37:30.760 --> 37:33.840
I think would have been
incredibly important

37:34.440 --> 37:37.560
during the original trial,
and that was withheld from us.

37:40.640 --> 37:41.720
Mm-hmm.

37:44.800 --> 37:46.280
`

37:59.760 --> 38:02.840
If the State had done their job

38:02.920 --> 38:07.560
and done the DNA analysis
on Kathleen's clothing to begin with,

38:07.960 --> 38:09.200
we wouldn't be here.

38:10.560 --> 38:17.360
If the State had had an expert witness
who was reliable and truthful,

38:17.720 --> 38:19.000
we wouldn't be here.

38:19.760 --> 38:21.840
But we are where we are,

38:22.720 --> 38:25.840
and they don't have a case,
and we can't proceed.

38:25.920 --> 38:28.840
You know, it doesn't make any difference
how we got to this point.

38:29.160 --> 38:31.080
- We're at that point. Right.
- Right. Right.

38:31.160 --> 38:34.760
We have to show
that the evidence can't be tested,

38:35.360 --> 38:39.840
and we have to show
that Kathleen's clothing...

38:39.920 --> 38:41.920
- Was not tested. Was not tested.
- ...was not tested.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.200
- I know Deaver had his mind made up.
- Yeah.

38:44.480 --> 38:47.800
They didn't want anything
to interfere with the case that they had.

38:47.880 --> 38:50.000
- Right.
- Right. Yeah, makes sense to me.

38:50.480 --> 38:52.720
The foolishness of their approach was,

38:52.800 --> 38:58.680
if the clothing had only shown
yours and Kathleen's DNA,

38:58.760 --> 39:00.280
that made their case stronger.

39:00.360 --> 39:03.560
Right. Would have rolled out any intruder,
or anybody else, exactly.

39:03.640 --> 39:04.520
- Right.
- Right.

39:04.600 --> 39:08.600
But they did not want to run the risk
of finding somebody else's DNA there.

39:08.680 --> 39:09.520
Right.

39:11.120 --> 39:12.760
- Okay.
- And here we are.

39:13.760 --> 39:16.200
It has been more stressful
than I expected it would be.

39:16.280 --> 39:17.440
- Mm-hmm.
- All of this.

39:17.680 --> 39:21.080
I was going to ask how you...

39:22.560 --> 39:24.920
- were doing?
- The closer I get, the more--

39:25.000 --> 39:28.520
You know, as long as it's out there,
it's not too bad, "Well, I can do this."

39:28.600 --> 39:31.000
But then, the closer you get
to something, it's like, "Oh...

39:31.080 --> 39:32.760
Wait a minute."

39:34.040 --> 39:37.440
This-- It's because it's been so long.
Oh, my God!

39:38.840 --> 39:41.720
- It has. Fifteen years?
- Mm-hmm.

39:43.160 --> 39:45.000
Almost 15 years since Kathleen died.

39:45.800 --> 39:46.640
Almost.

40:26.080 --> 40:30.000
I have been free for almost five years.

40:30.080 --> 40:32.400
Not completely, but relatively free,

40:32.720 --> 40:36.640
but this hanging over my head.

40:37.240 --> 40:42.400
And now it does look like
we're coming to an end.

40:43.320 --> 40:47.960
And that's what's making me nervous.

40:50.040 --> 40:53.760
Yeah, uh, it really is my life.

40:53.840 --> 40:58.960
It's not a life that's being created,
or governed, or dictated to me by others.

40:59.680 --> 41:01.400
It can be my life again.

41:02.120 --> 41:03.000
But...

41:03.880 --> 41:07.680
I can't get back all that happened before.

41:09.040 --> 41:13.160
And that's beginning to bother me
a little bit, where it didn't--

41:13.240 --> 41:15.040
It hasn't,
because I didn't think about it.

41:15.120 --> 41:17.880
But now I look at my children
and they're...

41:19.760 --> 41:23.720
they're not 18 years old in college.

41:23.800 --> 41:26.520
Now they're grown women,
they're grown men.

41:26.880 --> 41:29.840
Uh, I look at my brothers, uh...

41:29.920 --> 41:31.320
and we're all...

41:32.400 --> 41:33.320
old.

41:34.720 --> 41:37.440
And what happened? Where was I?

41:38.200 --> 41:40.560
Well, I know where I was, but, um...

41:41.760 --> 41:43.120
I didn't wanna be there.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.720
- Who's in my room?
- Okay, okay.

41:46.800 --> 41:49.120
- Who's in my room?
- Okay, okay, I'll get out!

42:11.240 --> 42:13.480
Okay, come on. Let's go to the pool.
Let's go to the pool.

42:13.560 --> 42:15.160
Go to the other room.

42:16.920 --> 42:18.960
Here he comes!

42:23.360 --> 42:25.400
Oh, which one should I get?

42:25.480 --> 42:26.560
My brother!

42:27.080 --> 42:28.760
- You want me to get your brother?
- Yes!

42:28.840 --> 42:30.600
- Who should I get?
- Dorian!

42:30.680 --> 42:32.800
- Dorian!
-

42:32.880 --> 42:34.240
- I'm gonna get you.
-

42:34.320 --> 42:35.720
I'm gonna get you.

42:38.200 --> 42:40.120
- Okay, who should I get?
- Get Dorian.

42:40.200 --> 42:42.280
You want me to get Dorian?
Well, let's go get him!

42:42.360 --> 42:43.840
- Let's go get him!
- Okay.

42:44.760 --> 42:46.120
- Who will I get?
-

42:46.200 --> 42:47.920
Let's get-- Let's get Lucian!

42:48.000 --> 42:50.360
- Get out!
- Let's get Lucian.

42:50.440 --> 42:52.160
Please go this way!

43:02.680 --> 43:03.920
Good morning, everybody!

43:04.560 --> 43:05.400
Oh.

43:21.520 --> 43:22.440
Okay.

43:29.200 --> 43:31.640
Now, Kathleen died
15 years ago.

43:31.720 --> 43:34.680
And this has been going on forever.

43:34.760 --> 43:36.720
-
-

43:43.240 --> 43:45.240
- Eight, seven, nine.
- Okay.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.360
If I start floundering.

44:00.400 --> 44:02.760
Hey, Michael, you doing all right?

44:02.840 --> 44:04.720
I am. I am.

44:05.160 --> 44:07.160
- What is it?
- That's Marines...

44:09.680 --> 44:12.000
- That's what we do.
- Oh, jeez.

44:12.080 --> 44:13.280
Where were you, David?

44:13.680 --> 44:15.920
I was, uh, I was in school, obviously.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.640
- Oh!
- You see?

44:18.320 --> 44:19.160
Hey.

44:20.880 --> 44:23.600
My Vietnam was trying to avoid STDs,
you know?

44:25.560 --> 44:28.400
- Did you win?
- No!

44:31.760 --> 44:33.360
-
- All rise.

44:33.880 --> 44:36.400
Oh, yes. The honorable
Superior Court of the County of Durham

44:36.480 --> 44:38.680
is now open and sitting
for the dispatch of its business.

44:38.760 --> 44:41.320
The Honorable Orlando F. Hudson Junior
Judge presiding.

44:41.400 --> 44:43.440
God save the State
and this honorable court.

44:44.480 --> 44:46.560
- All right.
- I call Timothy Palmbach

44:46.640 --> 44:47.960
to the stand, please.

44:51.160 --> 44:54.440
In the top rear portion
of the box is a wide-open bag

44:54.720 --> 44:58.840
containing the gray sweatpants
from, uh, Kathleen Peterson.

44:58.920 --> 45:02.240
But it's completely open
across the entire front of it,

45:02.320 --> 45:05.800
so you have blood, and urine,
and major areas of the, uh...

45:06.600 --> 45:09.720
of this particular pair of sweatpants
that are exposed.

45:09.800 --> 45:12.560
In addition to that, directly below that

45:12.640 --> 45:15.520
is another bag which is torn, uh, in half,

45:15.600 --> 45:18.680
such that there's a pair of white sneakers

45:18.760 --> 45:22.120
that the entire back half
of the, uh, the sneakers

45:22.200 --> 45:24.920
is now completely exposed.

45:25.000 --> 45:28.360
Um, and these are fully consistent
with Michael Peterson's sneakers.

45:28.440 --> 45:30.600
It's not just evidence,
it's critical evidence

45:30.680 --> 45:34.680
very relevant to, uh--
to our analysis in this case.

45:34.760 --> 45:35.600
Why?

45:35.680 --> 45:38.760
Because some of the theories
that were offered in this case

45:38.840 --> 45:42.880
would suggest that the victim was
succumbed to a beating-type death.

45:44.360 --> 45:46.760
In that bases of theories,
one is gonna expect

45:46.840 --> 45:49.640
contact between the assailant
and Kathleen Peterson,

45:49.960 --> 45:52.960
and in a contact,
one should expect a transfer

45:53.320 --> 45:55.720
of small amounts
or trace amounts of DNA.

45:56.080 --> 45:56.920
And so,

45:57.000 --> 46:00.800
all efforts have to be in place to protect
against the cross-contamination,

46:01.120 --> 46:03.440
so that at some point, if necessary,

46:03.520 --> 46:06.600
the testing could be done
to identify that traced DNA.

46:07.000 --> 46:07.840
Okay.

46:08.240 --> 46:11.280
Can evidence that was stored,

46:11.360 --> 46:15.840
such as those sweatpants,
can they be analyzed for DNA?

46:17.520 --> 46:21.840
Pragmatically, could you swab it
and go do DNA test? Certainly.

46:22.360 --> 46:26.920
Uh, would the results be reliable
in any fashion? No.

46:27.400 --> 46:32.320
And so can Kathleen Peterson's clothing
be analyzed...

46:33.800 --> 46:37.360
today, to determine
whose DNA is on her clothing?

46:37.800 --> 46:40.440
And can a reliable result be obtained?

46:41.520 --> 46:44.760
Yes, you could do it.
No, you would not have a reliable result.

46:45.160 --> 46:46.000
Okay.

46:46.080 --> 46:48.720
Your Honor, at this time, um,
I would like to show...

46:50.200 --> 46:51.760
the witness a video.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.520
Could you please describe
what we observe Mr. George doing

46:55.600 --> 46:58.200
before he starts taking the item
out of the bag?

46:58.280 --> 47:00.080
Yes, he put on vinyl gloves.

47:04.520 --> 47:07.160
I just ask you
to pay attention to Mr. Rudolf.

47:07.240 --> 47:09.800
- Do you see any gloves on his hand?
- No, sir.

47:09.880 --> 47:13.160
Is this appropriate manner
to handle evidence that may contain

47:13.240 --> 47:15.400
- biological evidence?
- Not ideal.

47:16.000 --> 47:20.520
In fact, it could result in contamination
from Mr. Rudolf, correct?

47:20.600 --> 47:21.480
It could.

47:21.560 --> 47:25.560
They had been left
on a window ledge, right?

47:26.040 --> 47:27.320
That's correct.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.600
Now, of course,
the window ledge wasn't that wide, was it?

47:30.680 --> 47:33.640
Do you recognize those
as being the shorts that were retrieved

47:33.720 --> 47:35.440
- from Mr. Michael Peterson?
- Yes, I do.

47:36.560 --> 47:39.760
These weren't collected
until 9:30 or 10:00 in the morning?

47:39.840 --> 47:42.320
They were not collected by myself
until that time.

47:42.840 --> 47:45.800
And where they were left
in the meantime was...

47:46.160 --> 47:49.160
and put them on a window ledge.

47:49.760 --> 47:52.520
Mr. Rudolf ran his hand all the way down
on the side of the pants?

47:52.600 --> 47:53.440
Yes, he did.

47:54.800 --> 47:56.840
And where is he placing
that item?

47:58.920 --> 48:00.240
Back on the witness stand.

48:00.320 --> 48:02.440
- And there's no paper down there at all?
- No.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.920
You don't know
who touched that area previously,

48:06.000 --> 48:07.560
that being on the witness stand, do you?

48:07.640 --> 48:08.480
No.

48:08.560 --> 48:10.720
You don't know if someone went by
and coughed on it

48:10.800 --> 48:13.560
before court began
or during the break, do you?

48:13.640 --> 48:14.560
No.

48:14.880 --> 48:16.960
You don't know
if somebody sneezed on it, do you?

48:17.040 --> 48:17.880
No.

48:18.200 --> 48:21.800
Putting his hands,
palms right down on the evidence,

48:21.880 --> 48:24.360
is that an appropriate manner
of handling evidence in court?

48:24.720 --> 48:25.760
Again, not ideal.

48:25.840 --> 48:29.040
And that could subject that evidence
to contamination?

48:29.120 --> 48:30.040
Possible.

48:31.880 --> 48:33.760
And based on what you saw,

48:33.840 --> 48:38.760
you did have a theory as relates
to what occurred within that stairwell,

48:38.840 --> 48:39.840
is that correct?

48:39.920 --> 48:43.360
It's not a singular theory,
but the theory embraced, um,

48:43.440 --> 48:45.080
the two scenarios.

48:45.160 --> 48:48.800
One would be, was the evidence consistent

48:48.880 --> 48:52.840
with Kathleen being beaten to death
in the stairwell with the blow poke?

48:52.920 --> 48:55.160
And our opinion on that was no.

48:56.040 --> 48:58.480
And the other theory was,
was the evidence consistent

48:58.560 --> 49:01.840
with her sustaining injuries
falling within the stairwell,

49:01.920 --> 49:04.560
um, and moving about for a period of time
until she expired?

49:04.640 --> 49:06.000
The answer to that was yes.

49:06.400 --> 49:09.440
And DNA evidence would not tell you
or assist you

49:09.520 --> 49:12.280
in determining how the fall occurred,
is that right?

49:12.920 --> 49:16.000
The dynamics of the fall
is really the orientations

49:16.080 --> 49:18.240
of where the injuries were relevant
to a surface area

49:18.320 --> 49:19.760
that could attribute them.

49:19.840 --> 49:23.040
And DNA evidence
wasn't necessary to do that.

49:23.120 --> 49:26.080
Okay. So the DNA would not, in any way,

49:26.160 --> 49:29.200
assist you in determining
whether or not it was a push,

49:29.680 --> 49:30.840
if there was a fall.

49:31.560 --> 49:32.560
Isn't that correct?

49:32.960 --> 49:36.040
There was not an additional theory
that a third party

49:36.120 --> 49:39.440
was engaged in a physical confrontation
with her in the stairwell.

49:39.520 --> 49:43.200
And-- and, therefore,
we didn't evaluate for that.

49:43.520 --> 49:47.160
Neither you nor Dr. Lee
requested any type of DNA testing,

49:47.240 --> 49:49.000
- is that correct?
- That's correct.

49:51.480 --> 49:53.160
Thank you.
No further questions.

49:53.240 --> 49:54.320
You're welcome.

49:54.400 --> 49:57.800
You and Dr. Lee
did not request DNA testing.

49:57.880 --> 49:59.040
- Correct?
- Correct.

49:59.120 --> 50:04.120
Was that your place in the course
of the representation of Mr. Peterson?

50:04.200 --> 50:05.240
I don't believe so.

50:05.560 --> 50:09.560
If the DNA analysis
had been done immediately

50:09.640 --> 50:12.840
after Kathleen Peterson died,

50:13.400 --> 50:16.640
- would that have been best practice?
- Yes.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.320
Would there had been the questions
about whether there was contamination

50:20.400 --> 50:22.360
in the courtroom during the trial?

50:22.800 --> 50:26.040
You still can raise a point,
but it wouldn't have had the same outcome.

50:26.360 --> 50:27.560
And that is why?

50:27.840 --> 50:30.760
Because we would have had the test results
that we could rely on.

50:30.840 --> 50:37.520
And ultimately, even how the evidence
was stored after trial

50:37.600 --> 50:39.000
would not have been an issue

50:39.080 --> 50:43.640
if the State had done the DNA analysis
of Kathleen Peterson's clothing

50:43.720 --> 50:45.080
at the time she died?

50:45.640 --> 50:47.440
- Correct.
- Very well.

50:47.520 --> 50:52.680
Is it possible to get new DNA evidence
in this case,

50:52.760 --> 50:54.440
at this point in time,

50:54.880 --> 50:57.200
with the evidence
in the condition it's in?

50:57.280 --> 50:59.440
- No.
- No further questions.

51:00.640 --> 51:02.800
Do you still stand by your report?

51:02.880 --> 51:03.760
Yes, I do.

51:04.280 --> 51:09.280
DNA evidence would not affect your opinion
regarding whether or not there was a fall?

51:10.280 --> 51:11.360
- Correct.
- Thank you.

51:11.440 --> 51:13.560
I have no further questions
of this witness, Your Honor.

51:14.280 --> 51:18.560
Why don't we take
our lunch break, uh, now.

51:19.200 --> 51:21.680
Let's come back at 2:30.
