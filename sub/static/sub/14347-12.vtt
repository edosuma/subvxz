WEBVTT

00:03.834 --> 00:04.799
Hey.

00:04.834 --> 00:06.067
Morning, son.

00:06.102 --> 00:07.301
What's goin' on?

00:07.336 --> 00:08.599
It sucks.

00:08.634 --> 00:10.567
The world is
completely screwed up.

00:10.602 --> 00:11.532
Yeah.

00:11.567 --> 00:12.967
You know,
back in the old days,

00:13.002 --> 00:14.368
you knew who
the bad guys were:

00:14.403 --> 00:16.065
Hitler, Tojo.

00:16.101 --> 00:18.400
They were easier
to identify back then.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.700
Yeah, well,
everything's gone to crap.

00:20.735 --> 00:22.699
Hey! Jesus Christ!

00:22.747 --> 00:24.202
Watch where you're walking,
numbnuts!

00:24.250 --> 00:25.868
Come out in the open
where people can see you

00:25.902 --> 00:27.284
so they're not
trippin' over you.

00:27.319 --> 00:28.667
I'm on the phone!
Will you shut up?

00:29.867 --> 00:31.398
Teddy!

00:31.433 --> 00:33.234
Can you drive me
down to the drugstore today?

00:33.269 --> 00:34.735
I got to pick up
my eye drops.

00:34.770 --> 00:36.166
I'm gettin' ready
for work, Dad.

00:36.201 --> 00:37.934
I'm not a goddamn
taxi service. Teddy!

00:37.969 --> 00:39.966
What? I'm on
the crapper!

00:40.108 --> 00:42.033
Come downstairs
and talk to your little friend.

00:42.153 --> 00:43.386
Don't call me little.

00:43.586 --> 00:45.432
Get a leash, baby!

00:45.467 --> 00:47.398
I'm taking this one
for a walk!

00:47.433 --> 00:49.432
You know,
my eyes are getting pretty dry.

00:49.467 --> 00:51.800
I'll pick up your drops
on my way home from work,

00:51.835 --> 00:52.765
all right?

00:52.800 --> 00:53.917
You know what brand, right?

00:53.952 --> 00:55.376
Hold on.

00:55.411 --> 00:56.765
Yeah.

00:56.800 --> 00:58.567
Call back. I'm on the phone.

00:58.602 --> 00:59.532
Who was that?

00:59.567 --> 01:01.799
- Jane, Jenny.
- Janet?

01:01.834 --> 01:03.967
Do I look like
a message service to you, huh?

01:04.001 --> 01:05.732
Yeah, I'm back.

01:05.767 --> 01:07.234
These people
around here are crazy.

01:07.269 --> 01:08.651
All right, I'm out of here.

01:08.686 --> 01:10.034
Hey, don't forget my drops!

01:10.069 --> 01:10.999
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:11.034 --> 01:12.234
The ones
with the blue label.

01:12.269 --> 01:15.099
Yeah!

01:15.134 --> 01:16.734
What the hell
are you talkin' about, Mel?

01:16.769 --> 01:17.918
I placed the goddamn bet.

01:17.953 --> 01:19.127
Five dimes on the Jets.

01:19.162 --> 01:20.266
No. No, you didn't.

01:20.301 --> 01:23.001
I called you last night
an hour before kickoff.

01:23.036 --> 01:24.365
I keep it all
in my head.

01:24.400 --> 01:25.999
I know you keep everything
in your head,

01:26.034 --> 01:28.634
but I got it in my head
that you owe me 1250 bucks.

01:28.669 --> 01:29.935
You're
out of your mind.

01:29.970 --> 01:31.166
It ain't me. It's you,

01:31.201 --> 01:33.167
you goddamn
cheating piece of shit.

01:33.202 --> 01:35.600
I'm done with you! Done!

01:35.635 --> 01:36.565
Bitch!

01:36.600 --> 01:38.134
Trouble with the wife?

01:38.169 --> 01:39.465
No, my bookie.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.750
I'm with this guy 20 years.

01:40.785 --> 01:41.966
He never makes a mistake.

01:42.001 --> 01:43.600
So I bet the Jet game
last night.

01:43.635 --> 01:45.101
A great game.
And I cover.

01:45.136 --> 01:46.567
He says I never placed the bet.

01:46.602 --> 01:47.966
Dirty prick.

01:48.001 --> 01:49.299
He doesn't write down his bets?

01:49.334 --> 01:51.050
No. He says
he keeps it in his head.

01:51.085 --> 01:52.767
This way,
in case he gets pinched,

01:52.802 --> 01:54.218
there's no paper trail.

01:54.253 --> 01:55.634
Never again with this guy.

01:55.669 --> 01:57.665
- Never.
- Hey.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.934
Hey, Garrity, go grab Franco
and give the Suburban a douche.

01:59.969 --> 02:01.334
He's not here yet, chief.

02:01.369 --> 02:02.835
- What?
- I just talked to him.

02:02.870 --> 02:04.266
He said he'd be in
in an hour.

02:04.301 --> 02:05.901
These guys think they
can waltz in here

02:05.937 --> 02:07.093
any goddamn time
they please.

02:07.138 --> 02:08.596
His father had a stroke
last night.

02:08.634 --> 02:10.167
- Oh, no shit.
- Yeah.

02:10.202 --> 02:11.665
Oh, man. How is he?

02:11.700 --> 02:14.368
I guess he's paralyzed
on one side.

02:14.403 --> 02:15.467
It's kind of a mess.

02:15.502 --> 02:17.565
That's tough.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.734
All right,
go clean the rig.

02:23.500 --> 02:25.034
That's a pretty big
bowl of cereal

02:25.069 --> 02:26.201
you got there,
sweetheart.

02:26.236 --> 02:27.451
You gonna eat all that?

02:27.486 --> 02:28.632
I'm sharing with Connor.

02:28.667 --> 02:31.268
That way only one bowl
and one spoon gets dirty.

02:31.303 --> 02:32.532
Well, what about cooties?

02:32.563 --> 02:34.578
Brother cooties are supposed
to be the worst, right?

02:34.646 --> 02:37.007
We're from the same family,
and we have the same cooties,

02:37.068 --> 02:38.812
- so it's okay.
- Hey.

02:38.934 --> 02:40.667
That is a lot of cereal there,
kiddo.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.400
Did you call me
a couple of minutes ago?

02:42.435 --> 02:43.551
Yeah. Who was that?

02:43.586 --> 02:44.667
You don't wanna know.

02:44.702 --> 02:45.732
What's up?

02:45.767 --> 02:47.599
Uh, I need some money.

02:47.634 --> 02:49.433
What happened to the money
I just gave you

02:49.468 --> 02:50.433
for the credit card?

02:50.468 --> 02:51.498
I know, I know,

02:51.533 --> 02:52.734
but the central air
is out,

02:52.769 --> 02:53.899
and I called O'Brien.

02:53.934 --> 02:55.699
He says it's gonna cost 4800
to fix it.

02:55.734 --> 02:58.117
Jesus Christ. Is he droppin' in
by helicopter? 4800?

02:58.151 --> 03:00.016
Where am I gonna get
that kind of cash?

03:00.061 --> 03:02.422
I don't know. You didn't seem
to have any trouble last time.

03:02.468 --> 03:04.032
Let me just
pull my pants down

03:04.067 --> 03:06.700
and grab it off the money tree
that's growin' out of my ass.

03:06.735 --> 03:07.634
Jesus.

03:10.234 --> 03:11.565
I'll see what I can do.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.600
Thank you,
and, uh, I need another favor.

03:15.600 --> 03:16.599
What?

03:16.634 --> 03:17.799
What's next week
like for you?

03:17.834 --> 03:19.599
I have this book fair thing
at the school,

03:19.634 --> 03:21.467
and I may need your help
taking care of the kids.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.301
I think I'm working a double
Wednesday-Thursday,

03:23.336 --> 03:24.901
but I'll have to look
at my schedule.

03:24.936 --> 03:26.565
Okay. I may not need you.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.001
When do you need the money by?

03:28.036 --> 03:29.134
Soon as you can get it.

03:30.533 --> 03:32.500
Like I had to ask.

03:40.429 --> 03:43.629
LEAVING

03:45.000 --> 03:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:34.134 --> 04:35.398
Hey, dildo,

04:35.433 --> 04:37.634
how about you get your
skinny ass down here

04:37.669 --> 04:38.765
and wash our bikes?

04:38.800 --> 04:40.533
How about I kick you
in the balls instead?

04:42.001 --> 04:43.717
Oh, Jesus Christ. Kevin.

04:43.752 --> 04:45.433
How the hell are you, man?

04:45.468 --> 04:47.233
Come on!

04:47.268 --> 04:48.700
I'm here! New York City!
New York!

04:48.735 --> 04:50.551
- Unbelievable.
- Ready to party!

04:50.586 --> 04:52.333
Hey, where's
the closest bar?

04:52.368 --> 04:54.467
I thought you guys weren't
coming in until next week.

04:54.502 --> 04:56.634
Change of plans. Listen, is it
okay if we crash here

04:56.669 --> 04:58.767
- for a couple days?
- I gotta check with the chief.

04:58.802 --> 05:00.117
Screw the chief.
I'm your cousin.

05:00.146 --> 05:01.618
- I outrank everybody.
- That's true.

05:01.662 --> 05:03.903
And we're firefighters,
not three guys off the street.

05:03.969 --> 05:05.533
You can stay.
Just keep a low profile.

05:06.767 --> 05:09.999
You know, like, quiet.

05:10.034 --> 05:11.283
I need 4800 right off the bat.

05:11.318 --> 05:12.498
I don't know, Tommy.

05:12.533 --> 05:13.934
Arlo's kind of
upset with you

05:13.969 --> 05:15.032
at the moment.

05:15.067 --> 05:16.667
He might not feel
like helping you out.

05:16.702 --> 05:17.932
Why is he upset with me?

05:17.967 --> 05:20.234
He says you tried
to crush him this morning.

05:20.269 --> 05:21.233
You called him
little.

05:21.268 --> 05:22.533
Just get me the money, okay?

05:22.568 --> 05:23.498
Okay, okay.

05:23.533 --> 05:24.734
Listen, pick up
some cold cuts

05:24.769 --> 05:25.751
on the way home.

05:25.786 --> 05:26.699
We're all out.

05:26.734 --> 05:28.134
Oh, yeah,
and get a canned ham.

05:28.169 --> 05:29.235
Preferably Danish.

05:29.270 --> 05:30.285
Yeah, yeah. Jesus.

05:30.320 --> 05:31.266
- Hey.
- What's up?

05:31.301 --> 05:32.465
I just got back from Jersey.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.101
My old man
had a stroke last night.

05:34.136 --> 05:35.101
- Sorry. Shit.
- Yeah.

05:35.136 --> 05:36.199
Hey.

05:36.234 --> 05:37.400
Where you at?

05:37.435 --> 05:39.398
Hey.

05:39.433 --> 05:40.498
What's goin' on?

05:40.533 --> 05:42.734
Daddy's taking me to work today.

05:42.769 --> 05:43.967
Really?

05:45.301 --> 05:46.467
Come on, let's go inside.

05:46.502 --> 05:48.266
Come on.

05:48.301 --> 05:50.800
So, you know, my mom's
gonna have her hands full

05:50.835 --> 05:52.500
with my dad for the next few,
um...

05:52.535 --> 05:54.534
Well, who knows how long.

05:54.569 --> 05:56.533
So now she's back with me.

05:57.967 --> 05:59.365
My grandpa is sick.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.034
Oh, yeah, that's--
I'm sorry. That's too bad.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.333
Yeah,
tell me about it.

06:02.368 --> 06:05.167
So is she gonna be here all day?
What if we get a call?

06:05.202 --> 06:06.567
I'm making this up
as I go.

06:06.602 --> 06:07.632
I don't know.

06:07.667 --> 06:08.632
Maybe Laura
can stay behind

06:08.667 --> 06:10.067
and look after her,
make herself useful.

06:10.102 --> 06:11.032
Not a bad idea.

06:11.067 --> 06:12.268
Can I have
one of these?

06:12.303 --> 06:13.233
Thank you.

06:13.268 --> 06:14.567
Hey, Franco, how's your dad?

06:14.602 --> 06:15.834
It's hard to tell,
chief.

06:15.869 --> 06:17.067
He's in and out,
you know.

06:17.102 --> 06:18.066
Oh.

06:18.101 --> 06:19.433
Hey, hi, sweetie.

06:19.468 --> 06:20.432
How are you?

06:20.467 --> 06:21.465
What's with this?

06:21.500 --> 06:22.932
Oh, that's my daughter,
chief.

06:22.967 --> 06:25.167
You know, she was staying home
with my folks, but now...

06:25.202 --> 06:27.001
Well, look,
I don't wanna be a hard-ass,

06:27.036 --> 06:28.800
and that's not a word
you should ever use,

06:28.835 --> 06:30.732
but we got regulations.

06:30.767 --> 06:32.767
I know, chief.
Just give me a couple of hours.

06:32.802 --> 06:34.368
I'll make sure
she gets out of here.

06:34.403 --> 06:36.066
Fine. You guys
seen Gavin?

06:36.101 --> 06:38.134
- I think he's in the locker room.
- Great. Okay.

06:38.169 --> 06:39.234
Nice to see you,
sweetie.

06:40.800 --> 06:41.734
Okay.

06:47.301 --> 06:48.550
Hey.

06:48.585 --> 06:49.765
Hey.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.465
What's goin' on?

06:51.500 --> 06:54.034
I've been hearing
some things.

06:54.069 --> 06:55.765
Things about what?

06:55.800 --> 06:56.966
About you and Jimmy's widow.

06:57.001 --> 06:58.299
You've been seen around
together.

06:58.334 --> 07:00.500
We go out to dinner,
like, once a week.

07:00.535 --> 07:01.732
It's, like, a family thing--

07:01.767 --> 07:03.667
That's all there is to it?
A family thing?

07:03.702 --> 07:04.867
That's all there is to it.

07:04.902 --> 07:05.866
Come on, Tommy, huh?

07:05.901 --> 07:07.365
You guys
have been seen out together.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.933
- If there's something going on--
- There's nothing going on.

07:09.968 --> 07:12.467
You get caught screwin' around
with one of the widows,

07:12.502 --> 07:14.251
you lose a lot of friends here
real fast.

07:14.286 --> 07:15.966
If there's something
going on, end it.

07:16.001 --> 07:18.134
It'd be the smartest thing
you've done in a long time.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.001
Hey, you think
she's gonna be okay?

07:37.036 --> 07:38.832
- Who?
- Keela.

07:38.867 --> 07:40.767
Oh, yeah, yeah, she'll be fine.
No worries, bro.

07:43.201 --> 07:44.800
So this guy comes up
on his Kawasaki.

07:44.835 --> 07:46.132
Gives me this look

07:46.167 --> 07:48.101
like he's about to say
some real negative shit

07:48.136 --> 07:49.351
about my Harley.

07:49.386 --> 07:50.532
What did he say?

07:50.567 --> 07:51.765
I punched him
in the throat

07:51.800 --> 07:53.400
before he had
the chance to say it.

07:53.435 --> 07:54.500
Which you should
never do.

07:54.535 --> 07:56.233
Oh, yeah.

07:56.268 --> 07:58.001
Tell me that ain't
rigor mortis.

07:58.036 --> 07:59.601
I hope not.

07:59.636 --> 08:01.132
What you got?

08:01.167 --> 08:03.234
Guy, Middle Eastern,
30 years of age, give or take.

08:03.269 --> 08:05.134
Impaled with a tree branch.

08:05.169 --> 08:06.299
A tree branch?

08:06.334 --> 08:07.533
In the middle of Manhattan?

08:07.568 --> 08:08.699
Rooftop garden.

08:08.734 --> 08:10.167
Dead branch broke off
in the wind,

08:10.202 --> 08:11.432
bam.

08:11.467 --> 08:12.850
Battalion 1-5

08:12.885 --> 08:14.199
to 1-5 Alpha....

08:14.234 --> 08:17.067
So you, uh, seeing anyone?

08:17.102 --> 08:18.066
What?

08:18.101 --> 08:19.532
Just asking.

08:19.567 --> 08:20.901
That's none of your business.

08:20.936 --> 08:22.066
Okay.

08:22.105 --> 08:24.015
I was just making conversation,
that's all.

08:26.667 --> 08:27.934
Are you seeing anyone?

08:27.969 --> 08:28.899
No.

08:28.934 --> 08:30.032
- No.
- No?

08:30.067 --> 08:31.467
Yeah, I'm such a loser
that way.

08:31.502 --> 08:32.717
Come on.

08:32.753 --> 08:33.899
Yeah, I am.

08:33.933 --> 08:35.498
I really have a hard time
meeting women,

08:35.533 --> 08:37.533
and when I meet the ones
that I actually like,

08:37.568 --> 08:39.167
I say something
or do something,

08:39.202 --> 08:40.767
and it all just...
It goes to shit.

08:40.802 --> 08:42.150
I think God
doesn't want me

08:42.186 --> 08:43.500
to be happy
in that way.

08:44.934 --> 08:47.767
Well, I've met my
fair share of losers,

08:47.802 --> 08:49.601
and you have
a little ways to go

08:49.636 --> 08:51.400
before you hit
that category.

08:51.435 --> 08:54.132
That's good to know.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.767
Maybe we should
go up to the roof,

08:55.802 --> 08:56.932
talk to the tree.

08:56.967 --> 08:58.767
It looks like an accident,
but you never know.

08:58.802 --> 09:00.368
There might be
a couple shrubs up there

09:00.403 --> 09:01.433
maybe saw somethin'.

09:01.458 --> 09:02.444
I say we go up,

09:02.473 --> 09:04.673
uproot the whole goddamn garden,
bring it in for questioning.

09:04.720 --> 09:05.890
Just 'cause it's vegetation,

09:05.934 --> 09:07.533
it thinks it can
get away with this.

09:07.568 --> 09:08.498
- Shameful.
- Really is.

09:08.533 --> 09:10.334
My mother was maimed
by a rose bush once.

09:10.369 --> 09:11.518
That explains the limp.

09:11.553 --> 09:12.632
Hey, ah, Laura, I just--

09:12.667 --> 09:15.268
I know that the guys
gave you a lot of shit

09:15.303 --> 09:16.333
when you first got here.

09:16.368 --> 09:18.001
Oh, yeah, like it's
really let up.

09:18.036 --> 09:19.765
I know. I just--

09:19.800 --> 09:20.966
If I ever said anything mean

09:21.001 --> 09:22.866
or something
that hurt your feelings,

09:22.901 --> 09:25.067
I'm sorry. I just--
The guys were really pissed

09:25.102 --> 09:26.467
about getting a woman
in the house.

09:26.502 --> 09:28.184
It's okay.

09:28.219 --> 09:29.593
I get it.

09:29.628 --> 09:31.364
Really?

09:31.399 --> 09:32.916
Yeah.

09:32.951 --> 09:34.398
Huh.

09:34.433 --> 09:36.667
I think
you're a really nice person.

09:38.034 --> 09:39.301
Are you hitting on me, Garrity?

09:39.336 --> 09:40.532
No. No, no, no.

09:40.567 --> 09:41.867
This is--
We're just talking, right?

09:41.902 --> 09:43.266
- Yeah.
- Okay.

09:43.301 --> 09:45.901
I mean, unless you wanted me
to be hitting on you.

09:45.936 --> 09:47.067
Then I am.

09:54.101 --> 09:55.500
It's not a hotel, Garrity,

09:55.531 --> 09:57.230
and it's definitely not
daycare center, Franco.

09:57.275 --> 09:58.689
I called this girl
I'm seeing, chief.

09:58.719 --> 10:00.523
She's gonna help me out.
It won't be a problem.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.634
- What about these three guys?
- They're firemen, chief.

10:02.664 --> 10:04.241
From the department
up in Fitchburg, Mass.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.316
They've never even been to
New York City, to Ground Zero.

10:06.369 --> 10:07.498
And they can't afford a hotel?

10:07.533 --> 10:09.334
Well, they were hoping
to spend all their money

10:09.369 --> 10:10.299
on booze and broads.

10:10.334 --> 10:11.532
You can't argue
with that, chief.

10:11.567 --> 10:13.400
They wanna put
something together for us,

10:13.435 --> 10:15.234
for the four guys we lost
on 9/11, a tribute.

10:15.269 --> 10:16.735
They're sweet guys,
chief.

10:16.770 --> 10:18.201
How long they gonna be here?

10:18.236 --> 10:19.432
Two days.

10:19.467 --> 10:20.767
Not one ounce of trouble. None.

10:20.802 --> 10:21.967
Not one ounce.
I promise.

10:22.002 --> 10:23.934
Yeah, promise this.

10:35.634 --> 10:36.732
Yeah?

10:36.767 --> 10:37.999
Hey, stranger.

10:38.034 --> 10:39.317
You coming over
tonight?

10:39.352 --> 10:40.565
Wasn't planning on it.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.201
You said that we were
gonna get together

10:42.236 --> 10:43.651
sometime this week.

10:43.686 --> 10:45.032
That gives me, what,

10:45.067 --> 10:46.301
six more nights
to choose from?

10:46.336 --> 10:47.599
Be nice.

10:47.634 --> 10:50.368
Listen,
I was thinking that,

10:50.403 --> 10:51.333
I don't know,

10:51.368 --> 10:53.001
you could come over,
you could get me,

10:53.036 --> 10:55.152
take me out to dinner,

10:55.187 --> 10:57.233
and, I don't know,

10:57.268 --> 11:02.567
do something really hot
and dirty and awful to me.

11:02.602 --> 11:04.334
Yeah, well, listen--

11:04.369 --> 11:06.067
Baby needs a spanking.

11:07.201 --> 11:08.301
Tonight's no good.

11:08.336 --> 11:09.365
All right.

11:09.400 --> 11:10.966
Well, I really gotta--

11:11.001 --> 11:13.284
I gotta talk to you,
so I wanna see you.

11:13.319 --> 11:15.567
I wanna talk to you
about some stuff.

11:15.602 --> 11:16.985
- What stuff?
- Stuff.

11:17.020 --> 11:18.333
You know, I hate it

11:18.368 --> 11:19.767
when people say
they wanna talk,

11:19.802 --> 11:21.132
and then
they don't talk.

11:21.167 --> 11:23.400
Well, I don't wanna do this
over the phone, so...

11:23.435 --> 11:24.765
Just tell me what it is, okay?

11:24.800 --> 11:26.700
Otherwise I'm gonna be wondering
all night,

11:26.735 --> 11:28.233
and it's gonna drive me crazy,

11:28.268 --> 11:30.667
not that you don't have a lock
on that particular skill now.

11:30.702 --> 11:32.934
Why do you have to be
such an asshole?

11:32.969 --> 11:34.199
Practice.

11:34.234 --> 11:35.832
Yeah, you know what?

11:35.867 --> 11:38.467
Why don't you call and tell me
when you're gonna come see me,

11:38.502 --> 11:40.600
and, um, oh, yeah,
stop being such a dick!

11:40.635 --> 11:41.533
All right, listen--

11:44.934 --> 11:46.001
That's going well.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.201
Christ,
they're all blue.

11:53.001 --> 11:54.299
Hey, how's it goin', Tom?

11:54.334 --> 11:56.101
Hey, O'Brien.
What's goin' on?

11:56.136 --> 11:57.333
Ah, kids are all sick.

11:57.368 --> 11:59.368
I have to get, like,
a gallon of cough medicine.

11:59.403 --> 12:00.901
Really?
At least you can afford it.

12:02.301 --> 12:04.334
Did you quote my wife
$4800

12:04.369 --> 12:05.732
for a central-air unit?

12:05.767 --> 12:07.767
At those prices, I shoulda
gone into your business.

12:07.802 --> 12:09.468
What are you talkin' about?

12:09.503 --> 12:11.099
4800.
That's what you quoted.

12:11.134 --> 12:12.899
Are you nuts?
I never spoke to your wife.

12:12.934 --> 12:14.899
I don't even remember
the last time I saw her.

12:14.934 --> 12:17.134
Well, somebody at your office
must have quoted her that price.

12:17.169 --> 12:19.334
No, that would be me.
4800 for a central-air unit?

12:19.369 --> 12:20.432
That's what she said.

12:20.467 --> 12:22.565
Jeez, I charge
those prices,

12:22.600 --> 12:24.201
I'd be buyin' cough medicine
in the Riviera.

12:24.236 --> 12:26.134
Take it easy,
will ya?

12:26.169 --> 12:28.667
All right.

12:37.800 --> 12:38.765
Wow.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.067
That's a lot of food.

12:40.102 --> 12:41.299
Yeah, well, keep eatin'.

12:41.334 --> 12:43.368
The more you tuck away,
the less I will.

12:43.403 --> 12:45.800
Oh, you need juice.

12:45.835 --> 12:47.599
I'm good.

12:47.634 --> 12:49.465
You know, it's okay.

12:49.500 --> 12:52.101
You can eat if you wanna eat.
You know I don't mind.

12:52.136 --> 12:54.551
I know you don't.
You're sweet.

12:54.586 --> 12:56.932
You know, I've been thinking.

12:56.967 --> 12:58.767
I mean, I realize we've
only known each other

12:58.802 --> 13:00.866
- a short time...
- Yeah?

13:00.901 --> 13:03.967
But, uh, I don't know,
I thought we'd move in together.

13:05.934 --> 13:07.834
You mean, like,
you move in here?

13:07.869 --> 13:09.433
Or we could get a place.

13:09.468 --> 13:11.051
Are you asking me?

13:11.086 --> 13:12.599
I'm thinking about it.

13:12.634 --> 13:15.134
I thought
I'd just float it out there.

13:16.934 --> 13:18.334
I think we should talk about it.

13:18.369 --> 13:19.735
I don't think
we should go

13:19.770 --> 13:21.066
rushing into things,
you know?

13:21.101 --> 13:23.551
I mean,
how well do we know each other?

13:23.586 --> 13:26.001
I feel like I know you
pretty well, but...

13:26.036 --> 13:28.234
All right,
let's talk about it.

13:28.269 --> 13:30.799
I'm gonna be late.

13:30.834 --> 13:33.234
You're always
leaving me.

13:33.269 --> 13:34.498
I know.

13:34.533 --> 13:35.767
You know,
it's not fair.

13:35.802 --> 13:37.101
I'll call you later.

13:37.136 --> 13:38.334
Uh-huh.

14:10.301 --> 14:11.684
Theresa?

14:11.719 --> 14:12.993
You okay?

14:13.028 --> 14:14.233
Mike?

14:14.268 --> 14:15.634
Yeah. You okay?

14:15.669 --> 14:17.118
Yeah, I'm fine.

14:17.153 --> 14:18.567
Call me later.

14:20.101 --> 14:21.901
Okay.

14:25.467 --> 14:28.350
Grandma said
I can't have cereal.

14:28.385 --> 14:30.509
She said
it has lots of sugar in it.

14:30.544 --> 14:32.634
No, not lots, sweetie.
It's all sugar.

14:32.669 --> 14:34.084
That's what makes it so yummy.

14:34.119 --> 14:35.500
I wanna be a vegan
like Grandma.

14:36.500 --> 14:37.599
Oh, yeah?

14:37.634 --> 14:39.134
We'll talk about that later.
Eat up.

14:44.234 --> 14:45.301
Hey, sexy.

14:45.336 --> 14:46.333
Hey, baby.

14:46.368 --> 14:47.867
Come on in.
How are you?

14:50.268 --> 14:51.432
Mm.

14:51.467 --> 14:53.167
Hey, you know,
you're saving my life.

14:53.202 --> 14:54.500
I hope
you know that.

14:54.535 --> 14:55.599
I appreciate it.

14:55.634 --> 14:57.400
This is real strange.

14:57.435 --> 14:58.532
What is?

14:58.567 --> 15:00.133
Well, usually,
when I come over,

15:00.168 --> 15:01.700
I've got my clothes off
by now.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.899
Yeah, I know.

15:03.934 --> 15:06.384
Um, so did you, ah,
come up with any ideas?

15:06.419 --> 15:08.834
I thought I'd take her
shopping at Macy's...

15:08.869 --> 15:10.066
Good, good.

15:10.101 --> 15:12.400
and then the big Toys "R" Us
in Times Square.

15:12.435 --> 15:13.517
Oh, that sounds good.

15:13.552 --> 15:14.565
You owe me, brother.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.201
Yeah, and I'm gonna
start paying you back

15:16.236 --> 15:17.333
real soon.

15:17.368 --> 15:20.134
You should pay me back
right now.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.918
Oh! Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:21.953 --> 15:23.632
- What?
- Take it easy now.

15:23.667 --> 15:24.867
Not in front
of my kid, okay?

15:24.902 --> 15:26.067
It doesn't make any sense.

15:26.102 --> 15:27.266
I know.

15:27.301 --> 15:29.101
I mean, it raises all sorts
of questions here.

15:29.136 --> 15:30.518
I mean, why did she
even bother lying

15:30.553 --> 15:32.126
about talking
to this O'Brien guy?

15:32.161 --> 15:33.700
And what'd she do
with all the money?

15:33.735 --> 15:35.932
That too.
It's troubling.

15:35.967 --> 15:37.934
I mean, come on,
when a man lies--

15:37.969 --> 15:39.635
- Well, it's meaningless.
- Completely.

15:39.670 --> 15:41.668
We're genetically engineered
to lie.

15:41.703 --> 15:43.667
Absolutely.
I mean, it's like breathing.

15:43.702 --> 15:45.365
In with the air,
out with the lie.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.201
It's a timesaver,
when you think about it.

15:47.236 --> 15:48.599
Think of all
the long, drawn-out,

15:48.634 --> 15:50.267
idiotic conversations
you'd have to have

15:50.302 --> 15:51.901
if you had to tell the truth
all the time.

15:51.936 --> 15:52.899
Lying gets rid of that.

15:52.946 --> 15:54.919
- Gets rid of conflict, tension--
- High blood pressure.

15:54.967 --> 15:56.166
Not to mention cholesterol.

15:56.201 --> 15:58.334
Many, many bad things
disappear when you lie.

15:58.369 --> 15:59.734
See, but when a woman lies--

15:59.769 --> 16:00.866
I know.

16:00.901 --> 16:02.167
And Janet never lies.

16:02.202 --> 16:03.365
Never?

16:03.400 --> 16:05.450
She's like a freak of nature
that way.

16:05.485 --> 16:07.500
Yeah, well,
good luck with that, pal.

16:07.535 --> 16:08.632
Thanks.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.266
I must be
losing my mind.

16:10.301 --> 16:13.201
My bookie's runner comes
and meets me at the house,

16:13.236 --> 16:14.365
and he gives me this.

16:14.400 --> 16:15.767
Jesus, Mary,
mother of God.

16:15.802 --> 16:16.866
Holy shit. Wow.

16:16.901 --> 16:18.217
How much is in there?

16:18.252 --> 16:19.476
Sixty-six hundred.

16:19.511 --> 16:20.665
What'd you hit?

16:20.700 --> 16:21.799
The Seattle game last night.

16:21.834 --> 16:23.567
- Baseball or football?
- I never bet it.

16:23.602 --> 16:24.932
The guy screwed me
last week,

16:24.967 --> 16:27.400
and I swore I'd never bet
with him again, so I didn't.

16:27.435 --> 16:28.800
Maybe he felt bad
about what happened.

16:28.835 --> 16:30.568
He doesn't
feel.

16:30.603 --> 16:32.168
He's a bookie.

16:32.203 --> 16:33.699
I'm gonna keep it.

16:33.734 --> 16:34.699
- Yeah.
- Why the hell not?

16:34.734 --> 16:37.100
I mean, take Jeannie
to a show,

16:37.135 --> 16:39.018
some dinner,
buy the tickets.

16:39.053 --> 16:40.866
And you'll have
plenty left over

16:40.901 --> 16:42.784
- for more degenerate gambling.
- Exactly.

16:42.819 --> 16:44.667
I mean,
I've been betting with this guy

16:44.702 --> 16:45.632
for 20 years.

16:45.667 --> 16:46.999
He's never made a mistake.

16:47.034 --> 16:50.167
All of a sudden,
two in one week.

16:50.202 --> 16:51.701
What the hell is with that?

16:51.736 --> 16:53.201
Who cares?
Keep your score.

16:53.236 --> 16:54.201
You deserve it.

16:54.236 --> 16:55.233
Keep it.

16:55.268 --> 16:56.867
It all evens out
in the end anyways.

16:56.902 --> 16:58.001
Yeah.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.967
I guess I'll...

17:05.733 --> 17:07.699
No. No way.

17:07.733 --> 17:09.583
- Why not?
- It's never gonna happen.

17:09.617 --> 17:11.433
Did you not say
that I was--?

17:11.468 --> 17:12.397
Did you not say

17:12.433 --> 17:13.833
that I was
a really nice person

17:13.867 --> 17:15.251
and that you thought
I was cute

17:15.286 --> 17:16.560
and that I kept
in good shape?

17:16.595 --> 17:17.834
Did you not
say those things?

17:17.868 --> 17:19.531
That's not what I need,

17:19.567 --> 17:21.598
to get involved
with a firefighter on my crew.

17:21.634 --> 17:24.268
Yeah, that's gonna make my life
a hell of a lot easier.

17:24.303 --> 17:25.685
Who says
we gotta get involved?

17:25.720 --> 17:27.067
We just have dinner, drinks--

17:27.102 --> 17:28.701
No.

17:28.736 --> 17:30.435
Please?

17:30.470 --> 17:32.369
Don't beg.

17:32.404 --> 17:34.002
You're neat.

17:34.037 --> 17:35.600
Oh, my God.

17:36.867 --> 17:38.233
Listen,

17:38.268 --> 17:40.268
I didn't bust my butt
to get through probie school

17:40.303 --> 17:41.599
and survive my first house

17:41.634 --> 17:43.432
to come here and eat shit
every day

17:43.467 --> 17:45.299
just so I could be
your little girlfriend.

17:45.334 --> 17:47.817
I mean, that was never the goal,
believe it or not.

17:47.852 --> 17:50.301
I need you guys to think
of me as a firefighter,

17:50.336 --> 17:51.700
nothing more, nothing less.

17:51.735 --> 17:52.899
I'm really sorry.

17:52.934 --> 17:54.533
I get it. I get it. It's okay.

17:54.568 --> 17:55.734
Wanna make out a little?

17:55.769 --> 17:56.699
No!

17:56.734 --> 17:57.667
Okay. Jesus.

18:00.901 --> 18:01.901
How you doin'?

18:01.936 --> 18:03.099
Fine.

18:03.134 --> 18:04.934
I thought maybe
you wouldn't feel like going out

18:04.969 --> 18:07.268
- to eat tonight.
- Why not?

18:07.303 --> 18:08.665
This morning.

18:08.700 --> 18:10.634
You seemed pretty sick.

18:10.669 --> 18:11.599
Yeah.

18:11.634 --> 18:13.134
Well, I'm okay now.

18:13.169 --> 18:14.699
It was weird,

18:14.734 --> 18:17.734
because you didn't look sick,
and you didn't say anything.

18:17.769 --> 18:18.967
I'm bulimic.

18:19.002 --> 18:20.166
Huh?

18:20.201 --> 18:22.084
I have bulimia.

18:22.119 --> 18:23.932
What is that again?

18:23.967 --> 18:27.299
It's not really
dinner conversation,

18:27.334 --> 18:32.201
but, uh, it's a condition
where you eat and then purge.

18:33.767 --> 18:35.967
You make yourself
throw up.

18:36.002 --> 18:37.333
Wow.

18:37.368 --> 18:38.498
That's not healthy.

18:38.533 --> 18:39.767
It can't be good for you.

18:39.802 --> 18:40.799
Mike...

18:40.834 --> 18:42.667
do you have any idea
how huge I'd be

18:42.702 --> 18:43.999
if I didn't do this?

18:44.034 --> 18:46.368
Let me give you a visual aid.

18:46.403 --> 18:48.568
It can't be
that bad.

18:48.603 --> 18:50.699
This is me two years ago,

18:50.734 --> 18:53.001
before I started
throwing up.

18:56.767 --> 18:58.299
Um...

18:58.334 --> 18:59.465
that's you?

18:59.500 --> 19:01.467
They had to use
a panoramic camera

19:01.502 --> 19:03.401
to take that shot.

19:03.436 --> 19:05.468
How much did you--?

19:05.503 --> 19:07.500
Almost 400 pounds.

19:07.535 --> 19:09.166
So I, uh...

19:09.201 --> 19:12.032
I guess my question is now,

19:12.067 --> 19:15.700
you still think
I should stop purging?

19:15.735 --> 19:17.732
Hey, it's your life.

19:17.767 --> 19:19.134
Whatever works for you, right?

19:27.034 --> 19:28.617
- New York!
- New York!

19:28.652 --> 19:30.166
- Whoo!
- New York!

19:30.201 --> 19:32.634
Hey, wait. Tell me
what you guys did today.

19:32.669 --> 19:33.818
Did you see
any sights?

19:33.853 --> 19:34.932
- We came here.
- No, I mean,

19:34.967 --> 19:36.433
did you see
the Empire State Building--?

19:36.468 --> 19:38.299
We saw that.
On the way to the bar,

19:38.334 --> 19:40.034
you could see the top,
between the buildings.

19:40.069 --> 19:41.665
I took a picture.

19:41.700 --> 19:44.183
But this place--
This place is great.

19:44.218 --> 19:46.667
They got beers
from 72 countries,

19:46.702 --> 19:48.765
390 beers in all.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.532
Nothing like this in Fitchburg.

19:50.567 --> 19:52.450
If you drink one beer
from every country,

19:52.485 --> 19:54.334
- they put your name on a mug.
- I'm doin' it.

19:54.369 --> 19:57.500
Me too.
52 countries left.

19:57.535 --> 19:58.699
Bartender!

19:58.734 --> 20:00.632
Lithuania,
for everybody!

20:00.667 --> 20:04.167
Yeah! Lithuania for everybody. Whoo!

20:04.202 --> 20:05.599
I love
those Lithuanians.

20:05.634 --> 20:07.767
Seriously, what time are you
guys heading back tomorrow?

20:07.802 --> 20:09.901
Afternoon. We still gotta
put together the 9/11 tribute.

20:09.936 --> 20:11.401
You know, to honor
the guys you lost.

20:11.436 --> 20:12.832
We already have,
like, pictures--

20:12.867 --> 20:14.867
No, dude, we never made it
down to Ground Zero.

20:14.902 --> 20:16.400
This is our way
of remembering.

20:16.435 --> 20:17.398
Chuck made a banner.

20:17.433 --> 20:19.433
Oh, hey, Chuck,
that's really cool.

20:19.468 --> 20:22.000
- We want to do more than that.
- Yeah.

20:22.035 --> 20:24.533
We're thinking an eternal flame.

20:24.568 --> 20:26.765
An eternal what?

20:26.800 --> 20:28.001
An eternal flame,
like JFK has.

20:28.036 --> 20:31.099
It'll burn
forever.

20:31.134 --> 20:32.832
Well, that sounds
kinda complicated.

20:32.867 --> 20:35.533
We're still planning it out,
but we think it could be cool.

20:35.568 --> 20:36.765
Holy shit.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.365
Isn't that the guy
from your house?

20:38.400 --> 20:40.667
Yeah. He said he had a date
with his new girlfriend,

20:40.702 --> 20:42.268
but there's no way
that could be her.

20:42.303 --> 20:44.665
- Jesus.
- She's giant!

20:44.700 --> 20:46.301
Someone oughta pull
the harpoon out.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.934
That can't be.
I think I'm gonna puke.

20:54.034 --> 20:56.250
Holy shit.

20:56.285 --> 20:58.467
Oh, my God.

21:00.700 --> 21:02.201
What are you doin'?

21:02.236 --> 21:03.166
Nothing.

21:03.201 --> 21:04.167
What's with the joint?

21:05.167 --> 21:06.665
The one in your mouth.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.398
Oh, Teddy scored some pot today,

21:08.433 --> 21:10.234
and I didn't wanna be
a party pooper.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.067
I thought you were off the shit.

21:12.102 --> 21:13.817
It helps my eyesight.

21:13.852 --> 21:15.498
I took two puffs on this,

21:15.533 --> 21:18.099
and I seen things
I never seen before.

21:18.134 --> 21:20.901
Did you know that
Teddy's friend is a midget?

21:20.936 --> 21:22.334
Give me that.

21:23.533 --> 21:24.599
Sure, of course.

21:24.634 --> 21:26.565
You don't care
about my eyesight.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.400
You know, you brought me
the wrong drops, asshole.

21:28.435 --> 21:30.001
You know what?
I already got three kids.

21:30.036 --> 21:31.066
I don't need another one.

21:31.101 --> 21:32.450
You're like
a goddamn teenager.

21:32.485 --> 21:33.800
You know, I gotta
drive you around.

21:33.835 --> 21:35.201
I gotta pick stuff up
for you.

21:35.236 --> 21:36.568
It's a pain in the ass.

21:36.603 --> 21:38.168
I didn't ask
to come here.

21:38.203 --> 21:39.734
You want me out,
kick me out!

21:39.769 --> 21:40.734
Don't tempt me.

21:40.769 --> 21:41.799
Hey, Tom.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.099
- I made chili.
- No kiddin'.

21:43.134 --> 21:44.901
What'd you mix it with,
a goddamn shotgun?

21:44.936 --> 21:46.066
Don't worry about that.

21:46.101 --> 21:47.684
I'll clean the place up
spick-and-span.

21:47.719 --> 21:49.233
- Listen, about your cash.
- What cash?

21:49.268 --> 21:52.634
The 4800. We went out
to the track today.

21:52.669 --> 21:54.101
The little guy
wasn't feeling it.

21:54.136 --> 21:56.034
Don't call me little!

21:56.069 --> 21:57.333
Sorry.

21:57.368 --> 21:58.632
Sensitive little prick.

21:58.667 --> 22:00.132
We're going back out
tomorrow.

22:00.167 --> 22:02.167
Don't you worry. I'll get
him back in the groove.

22:02.202 --> 22:04.600
I'm gonna have my dinner
upstairs, okay?

22:04.635 --> 22:05.700
You gentlemen enjoy yourselves.

22:06.901 --> 22:08.368
And keep it down.

22:09.967 --> 22:10.967
Do you hear me?

22:11.002 --> 22:12.433
Yeah.

22:19.034 --> 22:22.301
Mel, it's me, Jerry Reilly.

22:22.336 --> 22:23.985
What do you want?

22:24.020 --> 22:25.599
I wanna talk to you.

22:25.634 --> 22:27.834
Look, as much as I'd like
to be a greedy prick,

22:27.869 --> 22:30.134
I think you made a mistake.

22:30.169 --> 22:31.665
Who is this?

22:31.700 --> 22:33.917
Jerry. Jerry Reilly.

22:33.952 --> 22:36.134
I'll be right down.

22:36.169 --> 22:37.201
Okay.

22:39.433 --> 22:40.632
How do you know
my father?

22:40.667 --> 22:43.467
What are--?
Oh, Mel's your old man.

22:43.502 --> 22:45.901
Yeah. Are you
a friend of his?

22:45.936 --> 22:47.565
Business associate.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.367
So he makes book
for you.

22:49.402 --> 22:51.134
You're not a cop, are you?

22:51.169 --> 22:52.233
No.

22:52.268 --> 22:53.500
- Jerry Reilly.
- Rick Pressman.

22:53.535 --> 22:54.866
Nice to meet you.

22:54.901 --> 22:58.301
Mr. Reilly, you might wanna
take your action elsewhere.

22:58.336 --> 23:00.051
My father
isn't well.

23:00.086 --> 23:01.732
He has Alzheimer's.

23:01.767 --> 23:05.201
I... I'm really sorry
to hear that.

23:05.236 --> 23:06.465
It's a tough break.

23:06.500 --> 23:08.234
He was diagnosed
over a year ago.

23:08.269 --> 23:09.599
He's been okay,

23:09.634 --> 23:11.634
but lately the slide's
been pretty dramatic.

23:11.669 --> 23:15.201
That explains the mistakes.

23:15.236 --> 23:17.565
Jeez, uh... Poor guy.

23:17.600 --> 23:20.001
He used to be able to remember
thousands of bets every day.

23:20.036 --> 23:21.233
Now sometimes

23:21.281 --> 23:23.211
he doesn't even remember
where the bathroom is.

23:23.257 --> 23:24.878
And this just came on?

23:24.934 --> 23:27.134
There were warning signs,
but yeah.

23:27.169 --> 23:29.334
I'm really sorry
for your trouble.

23:29.369 --> 23:31.301
Oh, hey, this is his.

23:31.336 --> 23:32.234
Yours.

23:34.700 --> 23:36.667
- I'm really sorry.
- What do you want?

23:38.001 --> 23:39.565
Hey, Mel, it's Jerry.

23:39.600 --> 23:42.001
I just come by to say hello,
see how you were doin'.

23:42.036 --> 23:43.866
I don't talk to customers.

23:43.901 --> 23:45.734
Dad, let's just go back inside.

23:45.769 --> 23:47.451
Don't tell me what to do!

23:47.486 --> 23:49.134
When my son gets here...

23:50.433 --> 23:52.150
I'm right here, Dad.
It's me.

23:52.185 --> 23:53.867
My son will kick your ass!

23:55.433 --> 23:57.067
Do you have a brother?

23:57.102 --> 24:00.234
No, it's just me.

24:03.867 --> 24:06.001
Have fun, girls.
I'm headin' out.

24:06.036 --> 24:07.018
Bye, Daddy!

24:07.053 --> 24:07.966
Bye, honey.

24:08.001 --> 24:08.934
- Franco.
- Yeah?

24:11.368 --> 24:12.368
Mm.

24:14.067 --> 24:16.867
Nice. What did I do
to deserve that?

24:16.902 --> 24:18.699
Just a taste of
what's to come.

24:18.734 --> 24:20.934
You gotta
get rid of this kid soon, baby,

24:20.969 --> 24:21.899
or I'm gonna die.

24:21.934 --> 24:23.132
Wait. Hold on for a second.

24:23.167 --> 24:24.901
I'm not getting rid of her,
China.

24:24.936 --> 24:27.085
She's here, probably for good.

24:27.120 --> 24:29.199
I thought this was temporary.

24:29.234 --> 24:32.667
China, I can't keep tossing her
around from here to there.

24:32.702 --> 24:35.067
She's a little girl.
She needs stability in her life.

24:35.102 --> 24:36.901
What's the problem?

24:36.936 --> 24:38.700
She really likes you.

24:38.735 --> 24:41.166
I...

24:41.201 --> 24:42.134
I love you, Franco.

24:43.567 --> 24:45.101
I'm not saying that
to scare you.

24:45.136 --> 24:47.166
It's just
how I feel.

24:47.201 --> 24:49.034
We could be
great together.

24:49.069 --> 24:50.867
You feel it too, don't you?

24:52.368 --> 24:54.299
Yeah. I do.

24:54.334 --> 24:55.432
I really do, China.

24:55.467 --> 24:57.967
China, come play!

25:08.400 --> 25:09.765
I ran into him
in the drugstore,

25:09.800 --> 25:11.565
and he said
he never even talked to you.

25:11.600 --> 25:13.600
Yeah, well, I don't know
what to tell you, Tommy,

25:13.635 --> 25:14.600
because I talked to him.

25:14.635 --> 25:15.565
I guess he forgot.

25:15.600 --> 25:18.734
- Is that right?
- That's right.

25:18.769 --> 25:20.034
It doesn't sound right.

25:23.334 --> 25:28.667
I'm guessing if I...
flip this switch over here,

25:28.702 --> 25:30.268
everything's gonna work
just fine.

25:30.303 --> 25:33.032
Okay, okay, okay.

25:33.067 --> 25:34.632
Look, I needed money,
that's all, you know,

25:34.667 --> 25:36.817
and you've been coming up
with so much of it lately,

25:36.852 --> 25:38.967
I figured I'd keep asking
and hope for the best.

25:39.002 --> 25:40.667
I mean, the kids
are going to school

25:40.702 --> 25:42.266
in last year's clothes.

25:42.301 --> 25:43.734
You know, Katy's blouses
are all stained.

25:43.769 --> 25:45.699
None of Connor's pants fit.

25:45.734 --> 25:47.734
$4800 worth of pants?
That's a lot of goddamn pants.

25:47.769 --> 25:49.701
Yeah, well,
I have a lot of expenses.

25:49.736 --> 25:51.599
You know, things
that I've neglected.

25:51.634 --> 25:53.734
You know what? Forget it.
I don't want it.

25:53.769 --> 25:55.718
Look, look, look,
that's not the point.

25:55.753 --> 25:58.560
The point is,
just don't lie to me, okay?

25:58.595 --> 26:01.368
Because if we're both
lying, we got no shot.

26:01.403 --> 26:04.834
Not that I'm lying.

26:04.869 --> 26:05.901
Anymore.

26:05.936 --> 26:06.934
I'm not.

26:11.901 --> 26:13.365
You realize

26:13.400 --> 26:16.301
you're talking about, like,
170 pairs of pants, right?

26:16.336 --> 26:18.667
- Get the hell out of here.
- I swear to God.

26:18.702 --> 26:20.166
Maybe it was
his sister.

26:20.202 --> 26:22.167
Well, nobody has a sister
that big, okay?

26:22.207 --> 26:23.511
And they were, like,
holding hands.

26:23.553 --> 26:24.700
You hold hands
with your sister?

26:24.735 --> 26:26.099
- No.
- No, only that one time

26:26.134 --> 26:28.368
when we went into the woods
to eat the witch's house.

26:28.403 --> 26:29.685
Speaking about
eatin' a house--

26:29.720 --> 26:30.967
Chief, it was
terrifying, okay?

26:31.002 --> 26:32.532
The windows were shaking

26:32.567 --> 26:34.400
from the sound of
her thighs rubbing together.

26:34.435 --> 26:35.967
Probie's a goddamn
chubby chaser.

26:36.002 --> 26:37.765
Be nice,
you guys.

26:37.800 --> 26:40.299
Hey, hey, guys. Be nice.

26:40.334 --> 26:41.567
This isn't Romper Room, honey.

26:41.602 --> 26:42.699
All I'm saying, Lou, is--

26:42.734 --> 26:44.917
Lieutenant, okay?
You call me lieutenant.

26:44.952 --> 26:47.101
Maybe you guys
just shouldn't be so obvious,

26:47.136 --> 26:48.498
just this once.

26:48.533 --> 26:51.567
So what if the girl has a little
extra weight on her bones?

26:51.602 --> 26:53.467
I mean, she must be
something really special

26:53.502 --> 26:54.832
if Mike can see
beyond her weight.

26:54.867 --> 26:57.034
Yeah, I don't think anybody
can see beyond that.

26:57.069 --> 26:58.667
I think she blocks out the sun.

26:59.667 --> 27:01.533
Are you sure she's not twins?

27:01.568 --> 27:03.365
You guys are so hilarious.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.983
You know, you're not exactly
the slimmest guy around.

27:06.018 --> 27:08.567
And you could probably stand
to lose a few pounds

27:08.602 --> 27:10.067
before
you're picking on anybody.

27:10.102 --> 27:11.365
I never said
I wasn't fat.

27:11.400 --> 27:13.000
Hey, you know, maybe if things
don't work out

27:13.033 --> 27:14.901
with this tons-of-fun
that the probie's dating,

27:14.950 --> 27:16.745
you know,
you guys should hook up.

27:16.803 --> 27:19.177
I think he likes them
a little bigger than me.

27:32.067 --> 27:33.717
- Hey, boys, what's goin' on?
- Pretty good.

27:33.752 --> 27:35.368
We're just putting
the finishing touches

27:35.403 --> 27:36.899
on the tribute here.

27:36.934 --> 27:39.567
"For our brothers who...
Who "pershed"?

27:39.602 --> 27:41.901
Yeah, that's Chuck's thing.
Just let it go.

27:41.936 --> 27:44.201
I thought you guys were
at the bar right now.

27:44.236 --> 27:46.201
We did it. We got
our names on our mugs.

27:46.236 --> 27:47.398
What-- You've been
here two days.

27:47.433 --> 27:49.034
You drank a beer from
72 different countries?

27:49.069 --> 27:50.268
We sure did.

27:50.303 --> 27:52.152
Well, not Larry.

27:52.187 --> 27:53.966
I forgot
Uruguay.

27:54.001 --> 27:55.498
Oh, hey, sorry, man.

27:55.533 --> 27:58.700
Wow, you went with the whole
eternal flame idea, huh?

27:58.734 --> 28:00.870
Yeah, you got your flame
element exposed up top here.

28:00.919 --> 28:02.660
Underneath, you got
twin propane tanks.

28:02.702 --> 28:03.732
Twin tanks?

28:03.767 --> 28:05.317
Yeah. Dude, that's how
it stays eternal.

28:05.352 --> 28:06.867
One tank runs low,
youswitch it over

28:06.902 --> 28:08.199
and refill the empty.

28:08.251 --> 28:09.947
- It was Chuck's idea.
- That's brilliant.

28:11.067 --> 28:12.032
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:12.067 --> 28:14.032
Hey, Lou. Can I talk
to you for a sec?

28:14.067 --> 28:15.817
Yeah. Well, you know,
knowing you, it's 50-50,

28:15.852 --> 28:17.567
but try putting
a couple of words together.

28:17.602 --> 28:18.600
We'll see where it goes.

28:18.635 --> 28:20.465
All right.

28:20.500 --> 28:23.934
I think you guys should back off
of Laura a little bit.

28:23.969 --> 28:26.400
- Why's that?
- Well, a couple of reasons.

28:31.167 --> 28:32.700
I think she's doing her job,

28:32.735 --> 28:34.284
and she doesn't bust our balls

28:34.319 --> 28:35.834
the way we talk
around the house,

28:35.869 --> 28:37.199
and, you know,

28:37.234 --> 28:39.167
I just think
she's a cool chick, is all.

28:39.202 --> 28:40.901
You're bangin' her.

28:40.936 --> 28:42.301
What? I am not!

28:42.336 --> 28:43.632
Methinks you are.

28:43.667 --> 28:45.665
Jesus Christ. I'm not.
I swear.

28:45.700 --> 28:47.066
Listen, don't go there,
junior, okay?

28:47.101 --> 28:49.201
There's an expression:
"Don't shit where you eat."

28:49.236 --> 28:51.268
And there's a reason
why it's an expression.

28:51.303 --> 28:52.565
Well, it doesn't even
make sense.

28:52.600 --> 28:55.516
When you eat, you have to shit,
and usually very soon.

28:55.551 --> 28:58.433
Sean, I don't wanna get into
a semantics debate with you,

28:58.468 --> 28:59.834
because you don't know
what that is.

28:59.869 --> 29:01.134
Listen, if you're
bangin' her,

29:01.169 --> 29:02.467
knock it off, okay?

29:02.502 --> 29:03.400
Capeesh?

29:04.967 --> 29:06.498
But you know...

29:06.533 --> 29:08.334
you'll tell me how she is,
though, right?

29:10.101 --> 29:11.066
Son of a bitch.

29:11.101 --> 29:12.934
Just when it's gettin' good.

29:24.067 --> 29:25.567
Yo!

29:26.634 --> 29:27.632
Hey!

29:27.667 --> 29:29.665
Ah, shit.

29:29.700 --> 29:30.665
No keys, chief.

29:30.700 --> 29:31.799
Shit. All right, Franco,

29:31.834 --> 29:33.534
have the engine company
back down the street

29:33.573 --> 29:35.626
and come around the approach
to Riverside Drive.

29:35.650 --> 29:37.830
If this son of a bitch
isn't outta here in 30 seconds,

29:37.859 --> 29:39.922
release the brake and
shove his ass into the river.

29:39.959 --> 29:40.626
Ten-four, chief.

29:40.667 --> 29:42.334
Battalion 1-5 to 1-5 Alpha.

29:42.369 --> 29:43.334
Notify Manhattan...

29:45.034 --> 29:47.368
--We'll be delayed
getting to box 4259

29:47.403 --> 29:49.632
due to a double-parked truck.

29:49.667 --> 29:51.901
- Where's my water?
- Lou, we got a dead hydrant.

29:51.936 --> 29:53.199
- Is it marked?
- No, it wasn't.

29:53.234 --> 29:54.465
Goddamn. I love
this neighborhood.

29:54.500 --> 29:55.901
Listen. There's a hydrant
on the corner.

29:55.936 --> 29:57.266
Let's go get
a line hooked up.

29:57.301 --> 29:59.234
Garrity, maybe you could
leave your lady friend

29:59.269 --> 30:00.266
and come with us, please?

30:00.301 --> 30:01.901
Come on, Lou,
we need to get water.

30:01.936 --> 30:03.085
I'm hooking it, chief!

30:03.120 --> 30:04.199
We got multiple calls

30:04.234 --> 30:06.199
about a young girl
being trapped up on the roof.

30:06.234 --> 30:08.467
Our area ladder is never
gonna reach her if she's there.

30:08.502 --> 30:09.866
We'll go up
and look for her.

30:09.901 --> 30:11.401
Probie, grab a ladder.
Follow us up.

30:11.436 --> 30:12.866
- Give the probie a hand.
- You got it.

30:12.901 --> 30:14.700
Grab the longest ladder you got
on the double!

30:14.735 --> 30:15.866
We're going in.

30:15.901 --> 30:17.334
I don't see anything, man.

30:17.369 --> 30:18.365
Yeah, me neither.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.334
Maybe it was a crank call,
unless she jumped.

30:20.369 --> 30:21.398
Nice thought.

30:21.433 --> 30:22.767
Hey, we got nothin'
up here.

30:22.802 --> 30:24.035
You're sure?

30:24.070 --> 30:25.268
Yeah, I'm sure.

30:28.101 --> 30:29.234
Wait a minute.
What's that?

30:29.269 --> 30:31.365
Oh. No, I see her now.

30:31.400 --> 30:33.400
Sweetheart, hold on. We're
coming to get you, all right.

30:33.435 --> 30:34.765
Where's the ladder?

30:34.800 --> 30:36.368
Coming in right behind you.

30:37.767 --> 30:39.600
You know what?
Take this, will you?

30:39.635 --> 30:41.368
Tommy, what are you doin'?

30:41.403 --> 30:43.066
I wonder if I can make this.

30:43.101 --> 30:44.701
Make this? Tommy,
it's 10 feet across.

30:44.736 --> 30:46.301
- You're not gonna--
- I think I can do it.

30:46.336 --> 30:47.532
The ladder's coming
right now.

30:47.567 --> 30:49.600
Yeah, but the ladder's
not here yet, is it?

30:49.635 --> 30:51.451
There it is, Tommy.

30:51.486 --> 30:53.268
- I'm going.
- Holy shit!

30:53.303 --> 30:54.867
Tommy, no!

30:57.167 --> 30:58.400
Tommy, swing your leg up.

30:58.435 --> 31:01.067
Swing your leg up!

31:02.234 --> 31:04.800
Tommy, kick
your leg up!

31:04.835 --> 31:06.800
Kick your leg up!

31:11.467 --> 31:14.268
Hey. How you doin'?

31:14.303 --> 31:16.567
Asshole.

31:18.201 --> 31:19.517
Fitchburg?

31:19.552 --> 31:20.834
Fitchburg.

31:32.334 --> 31:34.134
Here you go.
She ate a lot of smoke.

31:34.169 --> 31:35.665
Might wanna get a mask
on her.

31:35.700 --> 31:38.700
Pretty amazing. That
was some grab, Tommy.

31:38.735 --> 31:40.700
Yeah. Almost grabbed
the pavement.

31:40.735 --> 31:41.665
No shit.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.498
- What?
- Nothing.

31:43.533 --> 31:44.934
No, you two got
somethin' to say,

31:44.969 --> 31:46.866
go ahead and say it.

31:46.901 --> 31:48.917
Well, you know, the ladder
was almost there, Tommy.

31:48.952 --> 31:50.934
You saw it coming in.
You decided to jump anyway.

31:50.969 --> 31:52.233
So I'm supposed
to wait?

31:52.268 --> 31:54.517
I got a girl stuck
on top of a burning building.

31:54.552 --> 31:56.732
I'm supposed to stand there
and scratch my balls?

31:56.767 --> 31:59.132
It would have taken 20 seconds
to get a ladder in place.

31:59.167 --> 32:01.567
You'd rather risk your life than
wait 20 seconds? That's crazy.

32:01.602 --> 32:04.034
Let me tell you two: some
people like to wait and watch.

32:04.069 --> 32:05.467
Some people like
to make the grab.

32:05.502 --> 32:07.632
I made the grab. All right?

32:07.667 --> 32:10.101
You two get your game up,
then you can talk to me.

32:12.334 --> 32:15.134
- Nice guy.
- Oh, he's great.

32:15.169 --> 32:16.600
He's a prick.

32:18.901 --> 32:21.201
So what did Lou mean by that
back there?

32:21.236 --> 32:22.398
By what?

32:22.433 --> 32:23.599
He called me
your lady friend.

32:23.634 --> 32:26.234
Oh, I just-- I told him
to be a little nicer to you,

32:26.269 --> 32:27.433
that's all.
Cut you some slack.

32:27.468 --> 32:29.000
- Are you kidding?
- Uh, no.

32:29.035 --> 32:30.533
You actually said that?

32:30.568 --> 32:32.699
Uh, yes.

32:32.734 --> 32:34.600
Before or after
you asked me out?

32:34.635 --> 32:36.134
After.

32:39.834 --> 32:41.901
Do you wanna have
dinner with me tonight?

32:41.936 --> 32:43.199
Yes. I just-- I thought--

32:43.234 --> 32:45.034
I'm having a momentary
lapse of reason.

32:45.069 --> 32:46.032
Don't interrupt it.

32:46.067 --> 32:47.500
There's an Italian place
near my house.

32:47.535 --> 32:48.734
Do you like that?
Nothing fancy.

32:48.769 --> 32:49.966
Yeah--

32:50.001 --> 32:52.400
If you tell anyone,
I swear to God, I will kill you.

32:52.435 --> 32:53.818
- No, I--
- I am not kidding. No one.

32:53.853 --> 32:55.260
Anyone finds out
and you're dead.

32:55.295 --> 32:56.814
I promise
I won't tell anybody.

32:56.849 --> 32:58.334
- Seven o'clock.
- Seven o'clock.

33:05.901 --> 33:08.201
Yeah, the show's called, what,
Avenue K or somethin'?

33:08.236 --> 33:10.066
No, I think
it's Avenue Q, chief.

33:10.101 --> 33:12.134
Jeannie's been after me
to see it for a while.

33:12.169 --> 33:13.268
Yeah?
You know it's puppets.

33:13.303 --> 33:14.765
What? You're kiddin'.

33:14.800 --> 33:16.467
Yeah. They curse. They swear.
They have sex.

33:16.502 --> 33:18.301
It's kind of kooky--
Holy shit!

33:18.336 --> 33:20.101
- What?
- Our house is on fire.

33:20.136 --> 33:21.899
Oh, Jesus!

33:21.934 --> 33:23.800
Battalion 1-5 to Manhattan.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.299
Transmit a 10-75

33:25.334 --> 33:28.234
at the quarters
of Engine 99, Ladder 62.

33:28.269 --> 33:29.834
Shit!

33:33.600 --> 33:34.850
Eternal flame.

33:34.885 --> 33:36.066
Yeah. Yeah.

33:36.101 --> 33:37.700
You realize, Garrity,
this being a firehouse,

33:37.735 --> 33:39.500
pretty much the last thing
we want to do

33:39.535 --> 33:41.765
is set this place
on fire.

33:41.800 --> 33:42.966
I mean, that
should be obvious,

33:43.001 --> 33:44.800
but somehow I feel the need
to bring it up.

33:44.835 --> 33:46.600
The guys, they just wanted
to pay tribute

33:46.635 --> 33:49.067
to Jimmy and Vito
and everybody.

33:49.102 --> 33:51.134
By what? Burnin'
the rest of us up?

33:51.169 --> 33:53.434
I'm gonna go and call
the commissioner

33:53.469 --> 33:55.584
and explain to him,
before he calls me.

33:55.619 --> 33:57.700
You don't wanna be here
when I get back.

33:57.735 --> 33:59.101
Got it.

34:07.101 --> 34:08.967
Hey, chief.

34:09.002 --> 34:10.568
Hey. Hi.

34:10.603 --> 34:12.099
How are ya?

34:12.134 --> 34:13.931
Smells like
someone's burnin' dinner.

34:13.967 --> 34:16.400
Yeah. We're havin'
roasted couch tonight.

34:16.435 --> 34:17.431
What's goin' on?

34:17.467 --> 34:18.632
I was just in the area.

34:18.667 --> 34:20.667
I thought I'd come
and say hi to the guys.

34:20.702 --> 34:22.333
Oh, good.

34:22.368 --> 34:24.299
Um, is Tommy around?

34:24.333 --> 34:26.533
Yeah, he's in the back,
in the kitchen.

34:26.568 --> 34:28.234
Oh. I'll catch you later.

34:29.667 --> 34:30.732
Hey, Sheila.

34:30.766 --> 34:31.966
Hey, Lou.
How you doin'?

34:32.001 --> 34:33.567
Oh, today
couldn't be better.

34:33.601 --> 34:34.734
What's with that?

34:34.768 --> 34:35.831
Unbelievable.

34:35.867 --> 34:37.467
I told Tommy to
cut that shit out.

34:37.502 --> 34:38.431
The balls on that guy,

34:38.467 --> 34:39.867
screwing around with
one of the widows.

34:39.902 --> 34:41.333
It's just wrong.

34:41.368 --> 34:43.800
He's about two weeks away
from being a total train wreck.

34:43.835 --> 34:45.967
- How you doin', chief?
- I couldn't be happier.

34:46.002 --> 34:48.199
Let's see,
my house is on fire,

34:48.234 --> 34:49.882
I have to go to
the theater tonight,

34:49.918 --> 34:51.533
and there's two people
in this firehouse

34:51.568 --> 34:52.632
that are doing something

34:52.667 --> 34:55.533
they both know
they shouldn't be doing.

34:55.568 --> 34:59.532
That goddamn prick.
He told you?

34:59.567 --> 35:01.667
I will kick his ass,
that little piece of shit.

35:01.702 --> 35:03.767
Couldn't keep his mouth shut
for one goddamn day...

35:03.802 --> 35:05.001
Any guesses on that?

35:05.036 --> 35:06.234
Just one.

35:14.201 --> 35:15.498
What are you doin' here?

35:15.533 --> 35:17.183
I said
I needed to talk to you.

35:17.218 --> 35:18.834
But why didn't you just call me?

35:18.869 --> 35:20.233
What's your problem?

35:20.268 --> 35:21.765
Because if these guys get wind

35:21.800 --> 35:23.199
of what's going on
between us, anything,

35:23.234 --> 35:25.500
it's gonna be the shit storm
to end all shit storms.

35:25.535 --> 35:26.533
Okay? You gotta be careful.

35:26.568 --> 35:27.584
Oh, I'm very careful.

35:27.619 --> 35:28.565
Oh, yeah. Bullshit.

35:28.600 --> 35:30.400
Name one time when
I have not been careful.

35:30.435 --> 35:31.699
My mom's wake.

35:31.734 --> 35:33.533
Okay, you practically mauled me
next to the coffin.

35:33.568 --> 35:35.333
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

35:35.368 --> 35:37.767
Mickey talked to me about it.
Janet talked to me about it.

35:37.802 --> 35:39.801
Well, anyways, I still
need to talk to you.

35:39.836 --> 35:41.634
All right, well,
I'll come over tonight.

35:41.669 --> 35:43.433
- Come on. You gotta go.
- Do you promise?

35:43.468 --> 35:44.567
Yes, I promise you, okay?

35:44.602 --> 35:46.101
- Ow, ow, ow!
- What?

35:46.136 --> 35:47.368
You're hurting me!

35:47.403 --> 35:48.768
I kinda like it.

35:48.803 --> 35:50.134
Stop. Jesus Christ.

35:52.967 --> 35:54.734
Hey, Laura, listen.
Tonight--

35:54.769 --> 35:56.398
- Um, I was--
- You asshole!

35:56.433 --> 35:58.767
You couldn't keep
your mouth shut for one day?

35:58.802 --> 36:00.567
One day?
I knew this was a mistake.

36:00.602 --> 36:01.765
- I knew it.
- Wait a second--

36:01.800 --> 36:03.883
And when you see me,
don't even look at me.

36:03.918 --> 36:05.967
Don't talk to me.
Don't say my name. Nothing.

36:08.567 --> 36:09.567
Not your day, kid.

36:09.602 --> 36:11.234
Not your day.

36:18.700 --> 36:20.166
Hey, what are you
still doing here?

36:20.201 --> 36:21.800
I thought you were
taking Jeannie to dinner

36:21.835 --> 36:22.765
before the show.

36:22.800 --> 36:23.932
Yeah, I thought so too.

36:23.967 --> 36:26.301
The stupid show starts
in about an hour.

36:26.336 --> 36:27.934
I don't know where
the hell she is.

36:27.969 --> 36:29.585
Hey, chief. Phone.

36:29.620 --> 36:30.994
Maybe that's her now.

36:31.029 --> 36:32.368
All right, good luck.

36:34.400 --> 36:35.498
Yeah.

36:35.533 --> 36:36.900
Yeah, is this
Jerry Reilly?

36:36.935 --> 36:38.233
Yeah, this is Jerry Reilly.

36:38.268 --> 36:41.867
Jerry, Dave Weidman
from 72 Truck downtown.

36:41.902 --> 36:43.066
Dave. What do you got?

36:43.101 --> 36:46.600
Well, actually, um,
I've got your wife here.

36:46.635 --> 36:48.166
What?

36:48.201 --> 36:50.067
I think she's lost.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.416
Where you at?
I'll be right there.

36:54.451 --> 36:56.542
My shift's over.
I'm heading uptown.

36:56.577 --> 36:58.634
If you want,
I could bring her to you.

36:58.669 --> 36:59.634
Yeah,
I appreciate that.

36:59.669 --> 37:01.268
Thanks, Dave.

37:06.167 --> 37:07.132
Well.

37:07.167 --> 37:08.301
How was your day, sunshine?

37:08.336 --> 37:09.999
Oh, just great.

37:10.034 --> 37:13.400
Full of self-hatred and misery
and blackness,

37:13.435 --> 37:15.134
just like every other day.

37:15.169 --> 37:16.799
What are
you guys doing?

37:16.834 --> 37:18.433
Arlo's teaching me
how to play chess.

37:20.467 --> 37:22.533
That piece can't attack
that way, Teddy.

37:22.568 --> 37:24.565
I got news for you, pal.
It just did.

37:24.600 --> 37:27.301
Hey, check out the envelope
on the counter.

37:27.336 --> 37:28.735
4800 on the dot.

37:28.770 --> 37:30.099
- Really?
- Yeah.

37:30.134 --> 37:31.932
Arlo was on fire
today.

37:31.967 --> 37:33.565
We get to go
into the saddling ring.

37:33.600 --> 37:35.600
Arlo gets to stare the horses
square in the face.

37:35.635 --> 37:37.632
Bingo! We cleaned up.

37:37.667 --> 37:39.134
You can thank me now,
ass-face.

37:40.700 --> 37:41.634
Yeah, maybe later.

37:42.834 --> 37:44.234
Hey, where's my old man?

37:44.269 --> 37:45.968
Uh, gone.

37:46.003 --> 37:47.632
Check.

37:47.667 --> 37:49.500
That's not check,
dipshit.

37:49.535 --> 37:50.699
Gone where?

37:50.734 --> 37:52.800
- Ireland.
- He went to Ireland?

37:52.835 --> 37:53.932
Yeah, Ireland.

37:53.967 --> 37:56.600
Yeah, he said something
about you pissing him off.

37:56.635 --> 37:59.234
Wait, he just packed his bags
and went to Ireland?

37:59.269 --> 38:00.199
Checkmate.

38:00.234 --> 38:02.665
Jesus Christ,
I give up.

38:02.700 --> 38:05.433
Did he say
when he was comin' back?

38:05.468 --> 38:07.832
Nah.

38:07.867 --> 38:10.032
Hey, Tom,
it's not just you.

38:10.067 --> 38:11.934
Your father's only been
to Ireland once,

38:11.969 --> 38:13.299
back after the war.

38:13.334 --> 38:15.368
He just wanted to see it again
before he died.

38:15.403 --> 38:19.034
He's gonna be
okay, Tom.

38:19.069 --> 38:21.268
He's gonna be fine.

38:25.400 --> 38:27.167
Taxi!

38:29.767 --> 38:31.717
What the hell
happened, Jeannie?

38:31.752 --> 38:33.743
I don't like to drive
in the city.

38:33.778 --> 38:35.734
- I got confused.
- I'm confused too.

38:35.769 --> 38:37.333
This show with puppets and--

38:37.368 --> 38:39.767
Here, let me find the tickets.
You know we're 10 minutes late.

38:39.802 --> 38:40.799
I'm sorry!

38:40.834 --> 38:41.967
That's okay. I'm thrilled.

38:42.002 --> 38:42.999
Let's go.

38:43.034 --> 38:44.433
Okay, but when
my husband gets here,

38:44.468 --> 38:45.834
you have to give him
your seat.

38:45.869 --> 38:47.299
What?

38:47.334 --> 38:50.001
You'll have to give him
your seat. Let's go inside.

38:58.901 --> 39:00.368
Oh, God.

39:04.201 --> 39:06.101
You okay, sweetie?

39:06.136 --> 39:08.432
Yeah.

39:08.467 --> 39:11.101
You're being quiet
tonight.

39:11.136 --> 39:12.734
Just thinking.

39:12.769 --> 39:13.767
About?

39:15.667 --> 39:18.467
Nothing.

39:21.867 --> 39:23.301
You know...

39:24.867 --> 39:27.799
Maybe...

39:27.834 --> 39:30.817
Maybe you're right,
what you said before.

39:30.852 --> 39:33.800
You know, about us
moving in together.

39:33.835 --> 39:36.617
Maybe we should wait,
you know?

39:36.652 --> 39:39.400
Get to know
one another better.

39:41.167 --> 39:42.467
Right?

39:43.901 --> 39:46.034
I thought, um...

39:49.467 --> 39:52.533
Is it the bulimia...
that's scaring you?

39:55.067 --> 39:56.834
Yeah, that's part of it.

39:58.334 --> 40:00.067
What's the other part?

40:04.767 --> 40:07.001
I'm kinda tired.

40:15.567 --> 40:16.767
Hey.

40:18.368 --> 40:20.084
You-know-who is asleep.

40:20.119 --> 40:21.765
- Finally.
- Yeah, finally.

40:21.800 --> 40:23.783
Now we can have
some fun, huh?

40:23.818 --> 40:25.767
Yeah, I can't have
the kind of fun

40:25.802 --> 40:26.799
that I wanna have

40:26.834 --> 40:30.301
with a little girl
sleeping in the next room.

40:30.336 --> 40:32.365
You gotta decide.

40:32.400 --> 40:35.134
Are you gonna be her daddy,
or you gonna be my daddy?

40:37.134 --> 40:39.533
China, is this a decision
that we have to make right now?

40:39.568 --> 40:43.001
Can't it wait, say,
you know, 20 minutes?

40:43.036 --> 40:46.001
Uh, no.
No, it can't.

40:50.067 --> 40:51.400
Come in.

40:55.467 --> 40:56.901
There you go.

40:57.967 --> 40:59.533
Thank you.

41:16.001 --> 41:17.400
Uruguay.

43:00.513 --> 43:02.483
Glad you could find
the time.
