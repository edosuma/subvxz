<i>No, you're not retarded, Sam. Jimmy is.</i>

do I act retarded?

08:38.740 --> 08:42.107
Just act natural.
That's not a dig, Sam.

08:42.177 --> 08:47.513
Someone with the I.Q.
of a 12-year-old is very functional.
They can read. They can write.

08:47.582 --> 08:50.710
They can hold a job.
They can go to a play, enjoy a movie.

08:50.785 --> 08:55.552
In fact, it'd be hard to pick
them out from the rest of us

to mainstream Jimmy.

Of course, in '64,
they didn't mainstream
the mentally handicapped.

09:36.231 --> 09:39.257
They locked 'em up in institutions.

Okay, remember what I told you.
If Mr. Samuels asks if you've
ever done heavy work,

11:07.489 --> 11:11.425
you tell him your father
was in the moving business and you
used to help him unload furniture.

11:11.493 --> 11:15.054
Yeah.
No. You say, "Yes, sir."
You have to say, "Yes, sir."

11:15.130 --> 11:18.793
Yes, sir, Frank.
You don't have to "sir" me,
Jimmy, just Mr. Samuels.

11:18.867 --> 11:21.893
Okay, Frank.
And don't forget to show him
Dr. Smithfield's letter.

11:21.970 --> 11:23.904
You have to show him.
This is important.

11:23.972 --> 11:25.906

Okay, Frank.
And you're not retarded!
You're just slow. Okay?

11:30.979 --> 11:36.383
Do I have to say that?
It's the best thing to say
if he asks, okay?

11:36.451 --> 11:40.478
Okay, Frank.
When you're in there with
Mr. Samuels, sit up and don't slouch.

Jackie Robinson?

14:16.611 --> 14:20.012

No. Jackie Robinson.

14:20.081 --> 14:23.710
He was the first black man
to break into the major leagues.

14:23.785 --> 14:26.345
And breaking in,
that was only half of it...

14:26.421 --> 14:30.084
because he took a lot of abuse
before they accepted him.

14:30.158 --> 14:32.092
But he paved the way...

14:32.160 --> 14:35.755
and made it easier
for the other ones
that followed him.

14:35.830 --> 14:41.097
Jimmy can hang onto this job
if the workers here are willing
to just give him half a chance.

27:48.555 --> 27:52.013
There was a girl named Trudy.
I don't have time for this.

27:52.092 --> 27:56.654
She was retarded, Sam!
Her I.Q. was lower than Jimmy's.

27:56.730 --> 28:02.635
And all the kids in the neighborhood,
they used to tease her.

28:02.703 --> 28:06.104
Kids can be cruel.
They'd call her names,

28:06.173 --> 28:09.973
like "dummy" and "monkey face."

28:10.044 --> 28:15.448
And I hated it.
And I used to get in fights
all the time over this.

But that's what big brothers are for, right?

28:19.787 --> 28:22.347
My mother couldn't handle it.

28:22.423 --> 28:27.952
That's probably why she ran off
with this stupid encyclopedia salesman.

28:28.028 --> 28:31.088
But my dad tried to keep us all together.

28:31.165 --> 28:34.532
He was a construction worker.
He went from job to job,

28:34.601 --> 28:37.331
and then when it took him
to the Middle East,

28:37.404 --> 28:42.364
I wound up in an orphanage,
and she wound up in an institution.

28:44.378 --> 28:47.313

I went back there for her.

28:47.381 --> 28:49.508
But it was too late.

28:49.583 --> 28:51.676
She was gone, Sam.

28:53.220 --> 28:55.211

It's okay, Jimbo.
