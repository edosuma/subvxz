00:01.084 --> 00:02.836
<i>Previously on Hit the Floor:</i>

00:03.003 --> 00:05.506
You two need to go public
as boyfriend and girlfriend.

00:05.672 --> 00:07.390
Reporters are gonna be grilling you.

00:07.549 --> 00:09.643
I'm now officially
Derek Roman's girlfriend.

00:09.801 --> 00:11.474
Olivia's estate defers to Chase.

00:11.637 --> 00:14.607
With one exception. Her 10 percent
ownership of the Devil Girls.

00:14.765 --> 00:16.233
- She left that to me?
- No.

00:16.391 --> 00:18.189
- Who's Vanessa Howard?
- My mother.

00:18.310 --> 00:21.063
- Kyle Hart. Free and clear.
- Divorce papers.

00:21.438 --> 00:24.362
I'm talking about blackmail.
Olivia demanded that I meet her.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.573
She went on and on
about some plan

00:26.735 --> 00:29.284
to crash the groundbreaking,
cause trouble for Oscar.

00:29.446 --> 00:32.700
- You killed my wife!
- I didn't, actually. I didn't kill Olivia

00:33.450 --> 00:35.373
and you didn't kill Olivia.

00:37.412 --> 00:38.880
Who did?

00:41.792 --> 00:43.135
Sloane?

00:57.933 --> 01:00.652
I told you. I was trying
to get into Oscar's office

01:00.769 --> 01:02.316
because I left my purse in there.

01:02.437 --> 01:04.360
- He's out of town.
- Facilities has keys.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.195
I didn't wanna bother them.

01:07.859 --> 01:10.408
If you're not gonna tell me,
I have to tell security.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.622
Raquel.

01:14.408 --> 01:17.002
Look, you don't know me.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.295
I don't know you.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.631
But you need to trust me.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.803
I'm investigating Oscar.

01:32.134 --> 01:37.857
- For what?
- Bribery, corruption, game fixing.

01:38.015 --> 01:40.438
The league was involved,
but it got too hot for them

01:40.559 --> 01:43.028
after what Chase did.
But I couldn't stop.

01:43.145 --> 01:46.866
Especially after I learned Oscar may
have been responsible for Mia's death.

01:47.608 --> 01:52.535
There are files on every Devil Girl.
They're in his office, I know it.

01:52.696 --> 01:55.700
There's a chance there's something
in them that could help me,

01:55.824 --> 01:57.997
point me in a direction.

02:01.747 --> 02:04.466
I have to think about this.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.964
You can't tell anyone.

02:07.127 --> 02:10.472
- Not security.
- I won't say anything to anyone.

02:10.631 --> 02:14.181
Tonight, that's all I can promise.
But you can't go back to Oscar's office.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.099
Not until we've talked
about this again.

02:18.889 --> 02:20.266
Okay.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.331
Wake up, sleepy head.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.208
Big day.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.543
What's so big about it?

02:40.661 --> 02:43.961
Hello? I'm opening my club tonight?

02:44.122 --> 02:47.296
Rome. Ring a bell?

02:49.711 --> 02:52.715
- Oh, boy.
- You're easy.

02:52.881 --> 02:56.101
Oh, I am, am I? I am, am I?

02:57.052 --> 02:58.929
Is it even going to happen?

02:59.096 --> 03:00.848
They were talking
about a huge storm.

03:01.014 --> 03:04.484
Oh, it's happening.
And I'm not the only one who thinks so.

03:09.564 --> 03:11.282
- You shouldn't have.
- Oh, I didn't.

03:11.441 --> 03:14.445
It's from cats that want you
to wear their stuff at the opening.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.699
"This would look amazing on you."

03:19.741 --> 03:22.870
- "Please wear me."
- "Welcome to the sweet life, Ahsha."

03:28.625 --> 03:32.550
You still haven't told me
how the will reading went.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.923
What did Olivia leave you?

03:35.090 --> 03:36.717
A lamp.

03:39.803 --> 03:43.683
I have an idea that will cheer you up.

03:44.057 --> 03:48.062
Let's crash Derek's club opening
tonight, steal some of that thunder.

03:49.646 --> 03:52.115
Can't, busy.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.658
Busy doing what?

03:55.277 --> 03:58.622
Mother's Day is coming early.

04:05.912 --> 04:08.461
Here. Purple's your colour.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.917
- These are pretty.
- Are these all for you?

04:11.084 --> 04:14.008
You bet your sweet ass they are.
I have a secret admirer.

04:14.171 --> 04:17.050
A filthy, rich secret admirer.

04:17.214 --> 04:19.012
Here. A little help?

04:21.011 --> 04:23.480
He bought out the Playground
for our first date.

04:23.638 --> 04:26.357
It's perfect timing too.
I'm back on the prowl.

04:26.516 --> 04:29.144
Oh, speaking of,
how are you doing with the single life?

04:29.853 --> 04:31.901
- Great.
- You're a lousy liar.

04:32.022 --> 04:34.445
Listen, the best way
to get over someone

04:34.608 --> 04:36.110
is to get under someone else.

04:37.068 --> 04:38.570
I don't need to get over anyone.

04:39.488 --> 04:41.206
You've got a good face, a great job

04:41.323 --> 04:44.327
and you don't have to blow
into a breathalyser to start your car.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.704
These days,
that's all some women can ask for.

04:46.870 --> 04:49.919
It is past time you got out there
and got someone under you.

04:50.081 --> 04:52.550
Or on top of, if that's your thing.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.177
I gotta go.

04:54.336 --> 04:57.089
- Nice flowers.
- Good luck staying dry.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.973
Or not.

05:08.475 --> 05:11.274
It was her share of the Devil Girls,
1O percent.

05:12.020 --> 05:15.399
But I never even met
this Olivia Vincent woman.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.659
Why would she leave something
like this to me?

05:17.818 --> 05:19.820
To screw with me.

05:19.945 --> 05:23.620
It means nothing to you,
but it means something to me.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.376
This is what I think is a fair offer.

05:26.535 --> 05:27.832
All you need to do is sign.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.962
Jelena, slow down.

05:30.622 --> 05:33.091
I haven't seen you in two years.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.799
And it's been almost that long
since I heard from you.

05:36.795 --> 05:38.138
I've been busy.

05:38.296 --> 05:39.718
Great.

05:39.881 --> 05:43.306
Great, let's start there.
Busy doing what?

05:45.637 --> 05:47.685
I'm still captain,

05:47.848 --> 05:50.226
Terrence and I broke up,
and I bought a new condo.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.354
Anything I can't read
in Us <i>Weekly?</i>

05:57.899 --> 05:59.572
Oh, it's your father.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.905
Hi, James.

06:04.447 --> 06:07.451
- Yeah. Yes, I'm here with Jelena.
- I have to be somewhere.

06:07.617 --> 06:09.836
I'll come back for these
when you've signed.

06:18.461 --> 06:21.089
I'm willing to believe you, for now.

06:22.007 --> 06:24.806
- What does that mean?
- It means I wanna know

06:24.968 --> 06:26.845
if those files prove anything.

06:26.970 --> 06:30.190
- So I'm gonna help you get them.
- Help me?

06:30.348 --> 06:33.898
There's no way you can get those files
without getting caught, but I can.

06:34.185 --> 06:36.734
- How?
- I restock his liquor cabinet every day.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.865
No one would think twice
if I was in there.

06:38.982 --> 06:40.859
Raquel, I can't ask you to do this.

06:40.984 --> 06:43.828
And I can't let you do this
unless I know it's legit.

06:49.576 --> 06:50.873
Okay.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.172
Okay.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.383
Does Pete know?

07:00.503 --> 07:03.928
I can't keep a secret from him
if he's gonna find out anyway.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.684
We don't share things.

07:13.892 --> 07:15.485
- Derek?
- Yeah, I'll be right out.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.229
Wait for me downstairs.

07:17.395 --> 07:19.773
Come here, girl, what are you doing?

07:20.607 --> 07:22.655
Come here, girl. For real.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.349
Can I help you with something?

07:48.134 --> 07:50.603
I'm waiting on Ahsha.
I told her I'd bring some

07:50.762 --> 07:53.356
of her press clippings
from last night.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.318
- Her press clippings?
- She can use them

07:56.476 --> 07:57.898
as a learning opportunity.

07:58.061 --> 08:00.985
I'm helping her pick out what she's
gonna wear to Derek's event.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.366
From here on out,
every event is a media event.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.570
I assumed your helping Ahsha
was a one-time thing.

08:06.695 --> 08:09.323
Well, it's great that the public
greeted her so warmly,

08:09.489 --> 08:11.491
but that can turn on a dime.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.628
I'm just helping to make sure
it keeps easing on down that road.

08:16.079 --> 08:19.379
You're at the arena so much
you'd think you were on the payroll.

08:21.209 --> 08:23.303
Clearly, you still want something
with Pete.

08:24.295 --> 08:25.717
Whatever your plan is,

08:26.506 --> 08:29.931
Ahsha will not be a part of it.
Do you hear me?

08:31.886 --> 08:35.607
- That's a little dramatic, no?
- Consider this a learning opportunity.

08:36.140 --> 08:39.270
The rehearsal studio
is for Devil Girls only.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.859
I trust you can ease your way out.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.537
Ahsha.

08:51.114 --> 08:52.582
Here.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.619
That's for Derek.
Tell him it's from Monika with a K.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.212
He'll know.

09:00.582 --> 09:03.176
I can see these are panties.

09:03.334 --> 09:05.428
Your phone number
is written on the crotch.

09:07.088 --> 09:10.262
- I'm his girlfriend.
- I know.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.200
Jake Vaughn.

09:28.359 --> 09:30.327
Wait, wait, wait. Don't go.

09:30.445 --> 09:34.200
Jake, my little Internet billionaire
slash stalker.

09:34.365 --> 09:36.868
No of fence, but you're disgusting.

09:38.119 --> 09:41.965
- I'm sorry.
- For what? Lying to get me into bed?

09:42.123 --> 09:45.218
For whatever it was you thought
you were doing to me in that bed?

09:45.376 --> 09:47.879
For dragging me here
for I can only imagine is a

09:48.046 --> 09:50.390
carnival of creepiness?

09:50.673 --> 09:52.016
I'm not that guy.

09:52.175 --> 09:53.927
I mean, I was that day.

09:54.094 --> 09:57.815
I just-- I didn't think a girl like you
could be interested in a guy like me

09:57.972 --> 10:00.441
so I hacked into your life and lied

10:00.600 --> 10:02.944
and I did stuff
I would never normally do and--

10:03.061 --> 10:04.904
It was wrong and I'm sorry.

10:08.191 --> 10:09.818
You're forgiven.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.536
Bye.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.041
Don't you wanna know
what I found about you

10:16.199 --> 10:18.702
in Olivia Vincent's police file?

10:20.662 --> 10:22.539
What did you say?

10:23.873 --> 10:26.001
Olivia's murder
was all over the news.

10:26.584 --> 10:29.428
<i>Access Hollywood, ESPN,
Entertainment Tonight.</i>

10:29.546 --> 10:31.844
<i>E! did</i> a whole <i>10-part
True Hollywood Story on it.</i>

10:32.006 --> 10:34.179
- Part six was particularly--
- Get to the point.

10:34.300 --> 10:37.224
I couldn't help
but hack into the police file,

10:37.345 --> 10:40.064
and, well, one of the things
they got from her house

10:40.181 --> 10:44.436
was proof you pulled
that $750,000 con with your husband.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.149
Ex-husband.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.947
What kind of proof?

11:10.628 --> 11:12.596
- You texted?
- Yeah.

11:12.755 --> 11:16.601
Listen. I was supposed to have lunch
with Jelena, but she cancelled.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.891
So you wanna have lunch with me?

11:19.512 --> 11:21.981
She cancelled
because her mother is in town.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.272
We're not together anymore.

11:29.439 --> 11:32.113
She has someone else
who can take care of her.

11:32.275 --> 11:35.449
There is no way Zero knows
what we know.

11:37.780 --> 11:41.876
And I believe you're exactly the person
she wants around right now.

11:44.704 --> 11:48.800
Okay, do whatever you want,
but I just felt like I needed to tell you.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.521
That'll teach me
to leave the top down.

12:09.687 --> 12:12.406
How'd it go poring through
all those bags with Lionel?

12:12.565 --> 12:17.196
Great.
I even left with one bag for you.

12:18.154 --> 12:21.203
Not sure you're meant
to wear it tonight, though.

12:23.034 --> 12:26.789
Monika with a K wanted you have them.
She said you'd know what it means.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.583
L-- I don't know what it means
or who Monika with a K is.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.467
It's just fan crap.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.508
- You don't know this girl?
- No, I don't know this girl.

12:34.671 --> 12:38.926
Ahsha, if you let every girl
that has fan crap for me get to you--

12:39.092 --> 12:41.311
Look, I'm only interested
in what you're wearing.

12:42.929 --> 12:46.149
So come on,
show me what you're wearing, girl.

12:47.016 --> 12:49.860
Show me what you're wearing, girl.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.566
Show me.

12:52.647 --> 12:54.365
I didn't pull anything with Benny.

12:54.524 --> 12:57.243
I signed some papers
I shouldn't have, that's all.

12:57.402 --> 12:59.450
Olivia got her hands
on some of them.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.330
I didn't even know
she scanned them.

13:01.489 --> 13:06.086
The cops haven't studied you
like I have.

13:07.954 --> 13:11.834
They don't know that what they have
would put you in jail.

13:14.335 --> 13:17.384
- I could wipe you from their system.
- I would love you for that.

13:17.463 --> 13:22.594
But first, I need to know that I'm doing
the right thing because I'm a good guy.

13:22.760 --> 13:26.810
Of course you are. How can I prove
you're doing the right thing?

13:26.931 --> 13:29.684
By telling me why Olivia had the papers
to begin with.

13:32.979 --> 13:36.199
Olivia was pissed she got fired,
wanted me to help her cause trouble.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.535
She got some Pl to dig up that stuff.

13:38.693 --> 13:41.537
I never saw the papers,
but when she told me she had them,

13:41.696 --> 13:43.369
I knew I was looking at 1O to 15.

13:44.490 --> 13:49.417
I'd do anything
to make them go away forever.

13:53.541 --> 13:54.884
'ZZZ

13:56.002 --> 13:58.050
Oh, those are my...

13:59.464 --> 14:01.011
And that's my...

14:04.677 --> 14:07.476
I'm glad those five pages survived.

14:07.764 --> 14:10.563
Otherwise I never would've been
reminded of how cute you are.

14:14.979 --> 14:18.233
If you never saw the pages,

14:18.399 --> 14:21.243
then how did you know
there were five of them?

14:22.445 --> 14:24.823
- You said.
- I didn't.

14:25.490 --> 14:30.121
I told you the cops got them
from Olivia's mansion.

14:31.704 --> 14:35.550
So if you saw them, that means
you were in Olivia's mansion too.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.193
Okay.

15:43.526 --> 15:44.869
I've seen the papers.

15:44.986 --> 15:47.409
Olivia told me she had them.
Which was stupid because

15:47.572 --> 15:49.745
did she think I never broke
into a house?

15:50.616 --> 15:52.664
I got them the day
before the groundbreaking.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.504
That means you were in Olivia's house
the day she died.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.293
Where were you
when she was murdered?

16:00.460 --> 16:01.757
Her husband confessed.

16:01.919 --> 16:04.798
He signed a plea deal.
That's different.

16:12.513 --> 16:15.858
I've sat here
and answered all of your questions

16:16.017 --> 16:19.442
but for you to ask me
where I was when she was murdered...

16:20.646 --> 16:24.116
I've been called a whore
and I've been called trash.

16:24.275 --> 16:28.371
But no one has ever made me
feel the way that you did just now.

16:29.530 --> 16:32.249
Jake Vaughn,
you can go straight to hell.

16:45.671 --> 16:48.094
- It's crazy, right?
- It looks so good.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.635
Everybody looks good.
I'm so proud of you.

16:52.970 --> 16:55.223
See? Aren't you glad you came?

16:55.389 --> 16:58.518
For a minute, I thought
you only existed naked in bed.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.900
Expecting anyone?

17:02.021 --> 17:03.364
No.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.241
I need a drink.

17:15.326 --> 17:17.169
You should come to my after-party.

17:17.328 --> 17:18.625
It's a party for two

17:18.788 --> 17:20.381
in my bedroom.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.220
<i>Hey-</i>

17:42.144 --> 17:44.522
Yo. You hanging out here
in alleys, man,

17:44.689 --> 17:46.441
you're missing one hell of a party.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.860
Did you go see Olivia Vincent
before she died?

17:49.443 --> 17:52.572
What? I-- I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.418
If you know what this is,
that means you met with Olivia, too.

18:05.418 --> 18:08.592
- What did she have on you?
- She knew about the coke.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.097
She knew I got it for you.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.600
She was willing to take everything
from me

18:12.717 --> 18:14.310
just to make a play against Oscar.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.850
She wanted you to back her up
at the groundbreaking?

18:16.971 --> 18:19.975
I could have been banned for life.
I would have lost everything.

18:20.141 --> 18:22.360
At least you would have been free.
Distribution?

18:22.518 --> 18:24.441
That's prison.

18:25.396 --> 18:28.115
Why didn't you come to me
with this first?

18:28.733 --> 18:30.701
Yeah, I could ask you
the same question.

18:31.110 --> 18:34.034
I have your back,
but you have to have mine

18:34.196 --> 18:36.824
if anyone starts asking questions.

18:36.991 --> 18:38.834
I've got your back.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.927
- Terrence.
- Hi, Vanessa.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.338
- Hi.
- Am I coming at a bad time?

18:50.463 --> 18:52.090
Not at all.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.135
I thought you were Jelena.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.228
- She's not here?
- No.

18:58.346 --> 19:02.522
No, we had lunch earlier or tried.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.401
She left when her father called.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.654
Are you surprised?

19:08.898 --> 19:10.320
I heard you two broke up.

19:11.525 --> 19:14.950
I'm sorry. You're a good man.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.537
I hope she didn't make things
too complicated for you.

19:19.575 --> 19:23.000
Jelena is a complicated woman.

19:24.038 --> 19:25.836
She just...

19:28.334 --> 19:29.631
Can I speak frankly?

19:34.006 --> 19:36.509
She watched her mother get beaten
her entire childhood.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.935
That's not an easy thing
to open up about.

19:42.098 --> 19:44.192
Can I speak frankly?

19:45.643 --> 19:47.566
This is none of your business.

19:47.728 --> 19:51.028
I came to talk to my daughter,
and if she has something to say

19:51.190 --> 19:52.533
she can say it to me.

19:59.490 --> 20:00.833
Nothing in Mia's file.

20:01.784 --> 20:03.912
Nothing in anyone's file.

20:04.078 --> 20:06.922
Headshots, start paperwork.

20:08.124 --> 20:10.798
- Another dead end.
- How long have you been doing this?

20:10.960 --> 20:12.803
A month, give or take.

20:12.962 --> 20:15.761
So right around the time you
and Pete were seeing each other?

20:15.923 --> 20:18.517
No. I'd already ended it with him.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.310
He was upset, but he accepted it.

20:23.597 --> 20:27.693
I better put these files back
before Oscar realises they're missing.

20:35.693 --> 20:38.196
Oh, hell, yeah. Hold my drink.

22:41.527 --> 22:43.575
- We're leaving?
- I am.

22:43.737 --> 22:47.332
To see Terrence? I brought you here.
I'm not leaving without you.

22:48.117 --> 22:50.461
Understand something.

22:50.619 --> 22:52.792
No man bosses me around.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.716
- Derek.
- What's going on?

22:59.879 --> 23:01.381
- It's been a minute.
- Yeah.

23:01.547 --> 23:02.924
Yeah. Everything is good.

23:03.090 --> 23:04.842
I'll holler at y'all later, okay?

23:05.009 --> 23:06.511
- Okay.
- Bye.

23:10.347 --> 23:12.850
- I'm not blind.
- What--? What are you talking about?

23:12.975 --> 23:14.602
Derek, stop.

23:14.727 --> 23:17.776
- I'm not trying to talk to these girls.
- I don't think you are.

23:18.439 --> 23:20.282
I do think you're hiding things
from me.

23:20.441 --> 23:25.038
The groupies, hangers-on, drinks,
God knows what else they send over.

23:25.195 --> 23:28.199
You think you're protecting me,
but you're making me feel stupid.

23:28.365 --> 23:30.083
I don't think you're stupid.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.916
If we don't have honesty,
we don't have anything.

23:39.627 --> 23:41.220
<i>Hey-</i>

23:41.921 --> 23:43.389
Thank you for picking Miguel up.

23:43.547 --> 23:45.891
No, not a problem.
I had to rent a boat to do it.

23:46.008 --> 23:48.261
They said you were in here.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.850
You left this at O'Malley's
before you ran out.

23:51.013 --> 23:52.686
God. Thank you.

23:52.848 --> 23:56.352
- You were at O'Malley's earlier?
- Yeah, the Playground was closed.

23:56.518 --> 23:59.488
- I was working there when you called.
- Were you drinking?

24:00.147 --> 24:02.946
- What?
- When you went to pick up my son,

24:03.067 --> 24:06.162
- were you drinking?
- I wasn't drinking, no.

24:06.320 --> 24:08.789
I had a drink hours before,
but I was completely fine.

24:08.948 --> 24:12.122
- That's it, I can't do this anymore.
- That's it? What do you mean?

24:12.242 --> 24:14.665
How many red flags
do I have to ignore?

24:14.828 --> 24:16.705
Red flags?
What are you talking about?

24:16.872 --> 24:20.467
You were with Sloane
from right after we first kissed

24:20.584 --> 24:22.803
to right before you asked me out
on a date.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.932
- And we talked about that.
- I thought the decision was mutual.

24:26.090 --> 24:29.219
Really, you only stopped
because she broke it off with you.

24:30.719 --> 24:32.687
You talked to her? About us?

24:35.766 --> 24:40.363
The fact that I don't know which "us"
you're talking about

24:40.729 --> 24:42.652
says everything.

24:42.773 --> 24:46.653
Pete, I'm a good judge of character.

24:47.194 --> 24:52.826
I'm even better at ignoring the things
that my head is screaming at me

24:52.992 --> 24:54.335
because I want love.

24:55.244 --> 25:00.125
Ineedit
But I need to stop hurting myself more.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.343
You're a good guy.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.212
I know you are.

25:05.379 --> 25:09.429
But I also know you're not my guy,
and I deserve someone who is.

25:09.591 --> 25:11.810
Raquel, I wasn't drunk.

25:11.969 --> 25:15.974
- I wasn't buzzed. I wasn't anything.
- Maybe you weren't. Maybe you were.

25:16.140 --> 25:20.941
Maybe you can tell me that I'm wrong
about everything, that I'm overreacting,

25:21.061 --> 25:25.692
that my instincts are wrong, and that
I should ignore them one more time.

25:27.443 --> 25:29.366
And maybe I would

25:30.112 --> 25:31.455
if you let me.

25:41.582 --> 25:43.300
Bye, Pete.

25:58.307 --> 26:00.105
You're leaving?

26:02.269 --> 26:04.317
Yes, your father got lonely.

26:05.230 --> 26:09.235
You're going to leave during a storm
because he got lonely.

26:14.615 --> 26:16.868
When I look at you,
I see anger and nothing else.

26:18.660 --> 26:21.413
I don't even know
how to talk to you anymore.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.424
And as your mother,
it breaks my heart.

26:25.501 --> 26:28.971
As long as you're caught in the past,
there's no future for you

26:29.129 --> 26:32.303
until you admit how angry you are
at your father.

26:32.424 --> 26:35.678
Release it.
You're gonna be this person forever.

26:37.554 --> 26:39.397
Angry at him?

26:40.057 --> 26:41.559
I'm not angry at him.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.898
I'm disgusted.

26:44.311 --> 26:45.938
BY you.

26:46.063 --> 26:48.532
You're the one
who let herself get beaten

26:48.690 --> 26:51.614
over and over.

26:51.777 --> 26:53.871
How many times?

26:54.029 --> 26:55.372
I lost count. Did you?

26:59.243 --> 27:02.463
And each time, you went back.

27:02.621 --> 27:05.215
You covered up the bruises
with your perfect makeup

27:05.374 --> 27:08.674
and you styled your hair,
so it fell in just the right places.

27:09.253 --> 27:11.381
That was years ago.

27:11.505 --> 27:14.008
We had troubles.
You were too young to understand.

27:14.174 --> 27:15.596
He is a different person.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.386
He released all his anger?

27:17.928 --> 27:19.851
Oh, my God.

27:22.850 --> 27:25.603
I abhor weak women

27:25.769 --> 27:32.118
who live and die by men
who don't care if they live or die.

27:32.860 --> 27:35.613
- Sound familiar?
- Weak?

27:39.616 --> 27:42.460
He never laid a hand on you.
Do you know why?

27:43.162 --> 27:46.792
Because of me.
I got hit so you wouldn't have to.

27:46.957 --> 27:49.585
You shouldn't have been getting hit
in the first place.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.769
Can you sign these so I can go?

28:03.015 --> 28:04.437
No.

28:05.767 --> 28:09.988
I think I'll hold onto that 1O percent
of the Devil Girls.

28:14.026 --> 28:17.530
You wanted me to say how I felt
and now you're punishing me for it.

28:18.530 --> 28:19.952
No.

28:21.783 --> 28:24.787
I'm holding onto it
because it's the one thing

28:24.953 --> 28:26.876
that made you call me
after two years.

28:28.874 --> 28:31.844
And it's the only thing
that'll make you call again.

28:37.466 --> 28:39.389
And this?

28:41.303 --> 28:43.397
This isn't over.

28:53.774 --> 28:55.071
I returned the files.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.612
Good.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.831
I'm not gonna say anything
to anyone.

29:01.865 --> 29:05.495
Especially not Pete. We broke up.

29:08.080 --> 29:11.550
- I'm sorry.
- I wanna keep helping you.

29:12.793 --> 29:15.421
- Raquel--
- Mia was my friend.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.806
If Oscar had something to do
with her death,

29:17.965 --> 29:19.342
I wanna help you prove it.

29:20.425 --> 29:22.223
I was with an agent long enough

29:22.344 --> 29:25.598
to know that there is some really
nasty stuff that goes down here.

29:27.432 --> 29:30.902
You said the league left you
high and dry. You don't have anybody.

29:37.484 --> 29:39.157
Okay.

29:39.987 --> 29:41.705
Okay.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.213
Come here.

29:52.916 --> 29:56.466
Derek, this is really nice,
but it's not what I wanted.

29:56.586 --> 29:59.931
Oh, I know, y0u--
You wanted honesty.

30:00.090 --> 30:01.888
And this isn't another distraction.

30:02.050 --> 30:03.347
It's to soften the blow.

30:05.012 --> 30:08.232
I know who Monika with a K is.

30:08.390 --> 30:10.017
I used to have sex with her.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.688
I've had sex with Monicas
with K's, C's

30:13.854 --> 30:16.107
and one with a silent Y.

30:16.356 --> 30:18.358
Here at the mansion, at the arena,

30:18.525 --> 30:21.369
even at the club
when someone else owned it.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.163
Sometimes we were sober

30:23.697 --> 30:26.826
and sometimes we were drunk,
sometimes we were high.

30:26.992 --> 30:30.667
Look, girls, they--
They throw it to me every day.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.797
At the player entrance,
in the parking lot.

30:32.956 --> 30:35.175
Even at the end of the driveway here.

30:35.334 --> 30:38.634
They don't care if I'm with someone,
don't care if they're with someone.

30:38.795 --> 30:41.048
Most of the time, I didn't care either.

30:41.256 --> 30:44.351
I got what I wanted,
they got what they wanted.

30:45.052 --> 30:46.554
Everybody left happy.

30:58.315 --> 30:59.737
Thank you.

31:01.985 --> 31:04.454
Now I'll give you a little truth.

31:06.406 --> 31:07.749
Okay.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.580
I hate this outfit.

31:13.705 --> 31:16.584
This fur is itchy as hell,
these pants are too baggy

31:16.750 --> 31:19.549
and this bra is squeezing my boobs
till they're dead.

31:20.003 --> 31:22.097
I like the shoes, though.

31:24.841 --> 31:27.060
I'll make you a promise.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.934
No more secrets.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.271
But keep them shoes on, though.

31:42.359 --> 31:45.112
You sure you don't want us
to stay till the morning?

31:45.278 --> 31:48.578
- We won't charge extra.
- I gotta get up early.

31:48.949 --> 31:51.418
Hey, isn't that your girlfriend?

31:53.495 --> 31:55.293
Not tonight.

32:06.591 --> 32:07.934
What are you doing here?

32:08.093 --> 32:11.939
I was at the hotel bar.
I was waiting for you to show up.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.892
You missed me.

32:16.393 --> 32:18.316
I already saw my mother.

32:18.478 --> 32:20.355
How did that go?

32:22.482 --> 32:24.484
Did you get anywhere?

32:25.110 --> 32:26.783
There's nowhere to go.

32:26.903 --> 32:29.656
There's always somewhere to go.

32:31.783 --> 32:35.413
When you were little, you used
to lock yourself in your bedroom.

32:36.121 --> 32:38.123
You're still doing it.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.668
Isolating yourself.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.677
You need to let people in.

32:42.836 --> 32:44.930
- I already got this speech.
- Not from me.

32:46.590 --> 32:49.810
Not from someone
who really knows who you are.

32:53.096 --> 32:55.565
I know what you want, Jelena.

32:56.141 --> 32:57.563
You could have it.

32:59.186 --> 33:02.531
You could be happy.

33:04.608 --> 33:07.031
You should be happy.

33:08.236 --> 33:10.785
That's all I ever wanted for you.

33:13.617 --> 33:15.619
You deserve it.

33:18.747 --> 33:20.420
Just"

33:21.791 --> 33:23.668
Open up.

33:37.140 --> 33:39.689
I'm not your problem, Terrence.

33:39.851 --> 33:44.027
We're not together,
and we never should've been.

33:44.439 --> 33:48.615
We were each big shiny prizes
the other bagged, nothing more.

33:48.777 --> 33:51.496
So let's not pretend any different.

34:21.685 --> 34:23.733
Yo, yo, come in, come in, come in.

34:28.108 --> 34:32.112
- You're not answering your phone.
- No service. Must be the storm.

34:32.320 --> 34:35.620
I was on my way home and I wanted
to stop by and give you a heads-up.

34:35.739 --> 34:37.833
I didn't wanna surprise you
at practise.

34:37.993 --> 34:40.792
It's something you may need some time
to digest.

34:40.954 --> 34:44.833
- What?
- I'm gonna be putting in new plays.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.924
You may not be getting the ball
as much as you're used to.

34:48.085 --> 34:50.839
- What are you talking about?
- I've been watching the film.

34:50.964 --> 34:53.137
We need to change things up
the next few games.

34:53.257 --> 34:55.806
- When did you come up with this?
- It was brought to me

34:55.927 --> 34:57.929
- by one of the coaches.
- Who?

34:58.972 --> 35:00.599
German.

35:01.474 --> 35:03.442
Look, I just wanted to give you
a heads-up.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.104
This is for the greater good.

35:23.496 --> 35:27.467
- What do you want?
- I crossed the line again.

35:27.584 --> 35:30.007
I'm sorry.
I can't seem to stop doing that.

35:31.838 --> 35:34.717
Obviously, the person
who killed Olivia Vincent

35:34.883 --> 35:37.477
is behind bars,
so it was a stupid question.

35:40.847 --> 35:43.817
I believe that you just wanted
a fresh start.

35:45.477 --> 35:48.651
- So I gave you one.
- What are you saying?

35:49.481 --> 35:51.779
I deleted the files.

35:52.651 --> 35:56.406
- You'll never have to deal with it again.
- Jake, thank you.

36:04.412 --> 36:08.883
Thank you for everything.
Maybe I'll see you around.

36:14.381 --> 36:16.759
Sorry again for going too far.

36:17.300 --> 36:20.679
It's okay. You never know
what someone is capable of

36:20.845 --> 36:22.973
if they're pushed the right way

36:23.390 --> 36:24.733
or the wrong way.

36:25.892 --> 36:27.439
Yeah.

38:43.363 --> 38:45.161
<i>Next time on Hit the Floor:</i>

38:45.323 --> 38:47.200
Oscar asked to see me in his office.

38:47.367 --> 38:50.120
- Do you know what it might be about?
- I don't.

38:50.245 --> 38:53.169
- I don't need a ticket. I have a Devil.
- Mom?

38:55.500 --> 38:59.550
Welcome to the Devils' Roast
to honour Derek Roman.

38:59.921 --> 39:02.219
You wanna make the audience roar,
we go together.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.638
Going together is not the worst idea
in the world.

39:04.759 --> 39:07.012
How hard is it to dig up dirt
on a 22-year-old?

39:07.178 --> 39:08.646
- Wrong Hayes.
- Mama bear?

39:08.805 --> 39:12.025
Everyone knows she had a wild past.
I wanna know how wild it got.
