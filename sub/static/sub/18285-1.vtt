[Jenny]: Yeah.

00:47.221 --> 00:48.439
I know.

00:48.483 --> 00:51.094
So what do you think
you're going to get him?

00:51.138 --> 00:52.139
Oh, I don't know...

00:52.182 --> 00:54.054
-Whoa!
-Oh, I'm sorry!

00:54.097 --> 00:55.881
Do you want some help
with these?

00:57.013 --> 00:58.058
No, I've got it.
Thanks.

01:15.292 --> 01:16.250
Have a great day.

01:16.293 --> 01:17.207
You, too.

01:20.689 --> 01:22.125
Who is that guy?

01:22.169 --> 01:23.692
Um, I don't know.

01:23.735 --> 01:26.129
He is awfully
good-looking.

01:26.173 --> 01:27.870
Okay, let's get a move on.
We don't want to miss this.

01:40.361 --> 01:42.102
Wow! Amazing tree!

01:42.145 --> 01:44.452
That is fantastic.

01:44.495 --> 01:46.193
[Jenny]:
And so real-looking!

01:46.236 --> 01:48.369
[Walt]: I know!
It's a thing of beauty.

01:48.412 --> 01:50.197
We should have bought
one of these years ago.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.415
Wait'll we get those
grab-bag presents under it.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.069
Morning!

01:54.201 --> 01:55.202
[Walt]:
These are beautiful! Did

01:55.245 --> 01:56.203
you pick them out
this morning?

01:56.246 --> 01:57.247
Yeah.

01:57.291 --> 01:58.335
'Tis the season!

01:58.379 --> 01:59.380
Alice is waiting
for us.

01:59.423 --> 02:00.685
We've got
a family.

02:00.729 --> 02:02.339
Sorry. Thanks.

02:02.383 --> 02:03.471
All right.

02:03.514 --> 02:04.602
Let's do it, team.

02:06.735 --> 02:07.605
[Jenny]:
Hi, guys!

02:07.649 --> 02:09.651
Oh, perfect timing.

02:09.693 --> 02:11.392
Alice just went
to get her.

02:11.435 --> 02:12.871
[Lauren]:
Oh, well...

02:12.915 --> 02:13.916
bet you guys're glad to see
the last of this place.

02:13.959 --> 02:15.178
Yeah.

02:15.222 --> 02:16.614
Actually, I think
we're going to miss you all.

02:16.658 --> 02:18.703
We're glad
we're going to have to.

02:23.404 --> 02:24.318
They're coming!

02:26.972 --> 02:29.105
Well, Emma put up
a little bit of a fight,

02:29.149 --> 02:31.412
but I think I convinced her
that she's going to be happier

02:31.455 --> 02:32.848
in a comfy crib at home

02:32.891 --> 02:34.371
than in that old incubator.

02:39.768 --> 02:42.205
You know, I...

02:42.249 --> 02:45.339
there was a time I thought
this day would never come.

02:45.382 --> 02:47.079
I knew it would...

02:47.123 --> 02:49.517
because we're here.

02:49.560 --> 02:50.909
It's a miracle.

02:50.953 --> 02:53.825
We're looking
at the miracle.

02:53.869 --> 02:54.913
Well, we know

02:54.957 --> 02:56.437
that you are anxious
to get her home.

02:56.480 --> 03:00.092
On glorious days like this,

03:00.136 --> 03:03.139
when our work is done,

03:03.183 --> 03:05.315
we have
a special custom.

03:05.359 --> 03:06.273
Ready?

03:09.754 --> 03:11.582
Dear little angel,

03:11.626 --> 03:14.585
we bid you adieu.

03:14.629 --> 03:16.021
Go spread
your sweet wings

03:16.065 --> 03:18.023
and fly.

03:18.067 --> 03:19.111
We're sorry

03:19.155 --> 03:21.375
we kept you
with us so long,

03:21.418 --> 03:22.985
but so thrilled
to be saying "goodbye..."

03:24.900 --> 03:28.251
and though you are leaving,
you won't be forgotten.

03:28.295 --> 03:31.123
We'll never be truly apart.

03:31.167 --> 03:33.169
So dear little angel...

03:34.649 --> 03:37.652
we love you so much,

03:37.695 --> 03:42.265
and each precious beat
of your heart.

03:45.747 --> 03:47.749
Now you take
your baby home.

03:47.792 --> 03:48.793
Yeah.

03:48.837 --> 03:50.055
Thank you.

03:53.450 --> 03:54.582
Bye!

04:02.503 --> 04:03.721
This never gets old.

04:03.765 --> 04:04.766
How could it?

04:06.202 --> 04:07.899
Oh, I printed out
that budget for you.

04:07.943 --> 04:09.205
Oh, bring it on.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.859
Are you sure
that you really want to do this?

04:10.902 --> 04:12.687
Absolutely.
I love a good party.

04:14.123 --> 04:16.733
Well, going to a party
and planning a party

04:16.778 --> 04:18.301
are two very different things.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.869
Well, I was
on my senior prom committee,

04:20.911 --> 04:23.001
and we covered
the entire ceiling of the gym

04:23.045 --> 04:24.916
in twinkle lights, so...

04:24.960 --> 04:27.354
I think planning a party
for a few nurses

04:27.397 --> 04:29.138
is going to be a little easier.

04:29.181 --> 04:30.531
Oh, I cannot believe

04:30.574 --> 04:32.576
that it's almost Christmas
again.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.404
I know,
it's only three weeks away.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.841
And I have not gotten anything
for my nieces.

04:36.885 --> 04:38.147
How about Mr. Dudley?

04:38.190 --> 04:39.583
[Alice]: Oh, he's got
his squeeze toys

04:39.627 --> 04:40.671
and his liver treats,

04:40.715 --> 04:41.716
and they're already wrapped.

04:41.759 --> 04:43.065
Good mama.

04:43.108 --> 04:45.459
That's the same budget
as every year,

04:45.502 --> 04:47.156
but you still have
to get it approved.

04:47.199 --> 04:48.157
It's just a formality.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.638
Okay.
I'm on it.

04:50.681 --> 04:52.292
Thank you,
and good luck.

04:52.335 --> 04:53.205
[Jenny]: See ya.

04:58.863 --> 04:59.821

05:01.866 --> 05:02.824
The flower girl.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.913
Sir Galahad.

05:04.956 --> 05:06.480
Ha! Hardly.

05:06.523 --> 05:07.524
Uh, yeah, well,

05:07.568 --> 05:08.699
and I haven't been
a flower girl

05:08.743 --> 05:10.788
since my aunt's wedding,
and I was four.

05:10.832 --> 05:11.920
Hi. Matt Crawford.

05:11.963 --> 05:13.704
Jenny Miller.

05:13.748 --> 05:15.489
Um...
no more Mr. Brockman?

05:15.532 --> 05:16.794
No, no.

05:16.838 --> 05:18.753
He got tired of CFO-ing,
so I'm the new guy.

05:18.796 --> 05:20.145
Are you here
on official business?

05:20.189 --> 05:21.190
Yes, I am.

05:21.233 --> 05:22.931
Here, have a seat.

05:22.974 --> 05:24.324
You know,

05:24.367 --> 05:26.326
you can look up all this up
on the Internet now.

05:26.369 --> 05:27.849
Yeah, but where's
the fun in that?

05:27.892 --> 05:28.893
I'm an old-fashioned guy.
I have yet to read an e-book.

05:28.937 --> 05:30.025
Wow.

05:30.068 --> 05:32.201
Yeah. All right,
what've you got?

05:32.244 --> 05:33.333
I just need this
approved.

05:35.073 --> 05:36.336
Christmas party...

05:36.379 --> 05:37.337
"nigh-kew?"

05:37.380 --> 05:39.339
"Nick-U."

05:39.382 --> 05:40.688
It's the Neonatal Intensive
Care Unit.

05:40.731 --> 05:42.037
Sorry.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.386
I'm still brushing up
on the hospital business.

05:43.430 --> 05:44.822
-I've got a lot to learn.
-'Kay.

05:44.866 --> 05:46.737
What?

05:46.781 --> 05:50.350
Uh, well, I don't really see the
hospital as a business.

05:50.393 --> 05:51.263
Oh, but it is.

05:56.268 --> 05:57.226
You know what?
It's just kind of a formality.

05:57.269 --> 05:58.096
Uh-huh.

05:58.140 --> 05:59.228
It's the same
every year.

05:59.271 --> 06:00.316
Yeah, I got it.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.841
Here's the thing, Jenny.

06:03.885 --> 06:07.062
There's a new policy
at the hospital,

06:07.105 --> 06:08.411
so all non-essential
expenditures...

06:09.543 --> 06:10.761
"Non-essential"?

06:10.805 --> 06:13.242
Yeah...
is being reduced by 25%.

06:13.285 --> 06:15.113
A Christmas party
for some hard-working nurses

06:15.157 --> 06:16.767
is hardly "non-essential."

06:16.811 --> 06:18.813
Well, I mean, compared
to paying the electric bill

06:18.856 --> 06:20.597
or keeping us stocked
with cotton gauze, it is.

06:20.641 --> 06:21.511
We don't use cotton gauze
anymore.

06:21.555 --> 06:22.469
It's a polyblend.

06:22.512 --> 06:24.471
Like I said, a lot to learn.

06:27.735 --> 06:28.692
I just don't think
I can pull off a party

06:28.736 --> 06:29.693
for that little.

06:29.737 --> 06:30.825
Sure you can.

06:30.868 --> 06:31.695
"Creativity"
is your middle name.

06:32.653 --> 06:33.567
You just met me.

06:35.220 --> 06:36.439
I'm a keen judge of character.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.485
So, here's what
I'm going to do.

06:38.528 --> 06:41.575
I'm going to reduce
your bottom line by 25%,

06:41.618 --> 06:42.750
initial there...

06:46.231 --> 06:47.711
Voila!

06:47.755 --> 06:49.365
Your new budget's approved.
I'll just make you a copy.

06:55.371 --> 06:56.459
So you were able
to calculate that

06:56.503 --> 06:57.504
in your head, hey?

06:57.547 --> 06:59.854
Yeah. I'm a numbers guy.

06:59.897 --> 07:01.551
No kidding.

07:01.595 --> 07:02.465
Ah, here we go.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.336
Thank you.

07:04.380 --> 07:05.816
So if you need any help,
you know...

07:05.860 --> 07:06.817
cutting costs...

07:06.861 --> 07:08.253
I'm your guy.

07:08.297 --> 07:09.385
Sure thing.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.342
It's nice to meet you,
Jenny Miller.

07:10.386 --> 07:11.343
Thank you!

07:14.912 --> 07:16.087
[Matt]: Jenny Miller...

07:20.657 --> 07:22.267
[Kate]: Thank you so much
for coming to help me.

07:22.311 --> 07:23.486
Are you kidding, Mom?

07:23.530 --> 07:25.140
It's my favorite
Christmas tradition.

07:25.183 --> 07:27.447
I thought staying up late
for Santa was.

07:27.490 --> 07:28.622
[laughs]

07:28.665 --> 07:29.666
Maybe when I was little.

07:31.146 --> 07:33.975
Okay, fine,
it's my second favorite.

07:34.018 --> 07:36.238
How's it going, guys?

07:36.281 --> 07:37.718
We've changed our minds.

07:37.761 --> 07:38.675
We're making fruitcake
instead of Christmas cookies.

07:38.719 --> 07:41.373
That's not funny.

07:41.417 --> 07:42.462
No, Bob, it's, um...
we're serious.

07:42.505 --> 07:44.028
I repeat.

07:44.072 --> 07:45.073
We'll let you know

07:45.116 --> 07:46.030
when the cookies
are ready.

07:46.074 --> 07:47.031
I could help you.

07:47.075 --> 07:48.163
Get out of here!

07:48.206 --> 07:50.121
Okay, okay,
take it easy.

07:50.165 --> 07:51.035
Let me know
the minute they're ready

07:51.079 --> 07:52.123
so I can make sure--

07:52.167 --> 07:54.430
"Make sure
they came out all right."

07:58.173 --> 07:59.087
I need your help.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.480
Sure.

08:00.523 --> 08:02.482
It's Bob's and my
30th Christmas together.

08:03.787 --> 08:04.962
Mom, that's fantastic.

08:05.006 --> 08:06.964
I want to get him
something special

08:07.008 --> 08:10.054
to let him know how much
these 30 years have meant,

08:10.098 --> 08:11.491
but I just don't know
what that something special is,

08:11.534 --> 08:13.493
and he's impossible to shop for.

08:13.536 --> 08:14.581
I know.

08:14.624 --> 08:16.321
It's 'cause he stopped
wearing ties.

08:16.365 --> 08:18.454
You're his stepdaughter.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.977
You could bring
some fresh perspective to this.

08:20.021 --> 08:22.066
Do you want me
to come shopping with you?

08:22.110 --> 08:23.677
Would you?

08:23.720 --> 08:24.765
Yes, of course!

08:24.808 --> 08:26.680
In what universe
would I not?

08:26.723 --> 08:28.159
Thank you.

08:28.203 --> 08:29.900
Wow, 30 years, hey?

08:29.944 --> 08:30.814
You sound surprised.

08:30.858 --> 08:32.163
Mm...

08:34.818 --> 08:37.342
You guys are so different.

08:37.385 --> 08:40.041
You know,
you like tennis, he likes golf.

08:40.083 --> 08:43.566
You could hike for days.
He can hike for an hour, tops,

08:43.610 --> 08:45.176
and those delicious mushrooms
you put in your risotto,

08:45.220 --> 08:46.134
he picks them out...

08:46.177 --> 08:48.092
and beets!

08:48.136 --> 08:49.703
You cannot get the man
to eat beets.

08:49.746 --> 08:53.184
Well, opposites attract,

08:53.228 --> 08:55.535
and we're in sync
where it counts...

08:55.578 --> 08:57.232
especially our love
for Christmas cookies.

08:57.275 --> 08:58.407
Mom, I don't know anybody

08:58.450 --> 08:59.887
who doesn't love
your Christmas cookies.

09:02.890 --> 09:04.369
[♪♪♪]

09:07.634 --> 09:09.374
[children chattering,
laughing]

09:15.685 --> 09:17.252
[Matt]: Hey!

09:17.295 --> 09:18.253
Hey!

09:18.296 --> 09:20.124
Wow.

09:20.168 --> 09:21.386
Someone has a Santa complex.

09:21.430 --> 09:23.475
Blame the toy store.

09:23.519 --> 09:24.389
Too many choices,
too much time.

09:24.433 --> 09:25.390
Where do you want these?

09:25.434 --> 09:26.304
Pile 'em here.

09:27.436 --> 09:28.437
[laughs]

09:28.480 --> 09:30.004
Well, I don't know.

09:30.047 --> 09:33.660
It seems like somebody
may be overcompensating

09:33.703 --> 09:34.791
for, like, a guilty conscience.

09:34.835 --> 09:37.054
My big sister...
the psychoanalyst.

09:37.098 --> 09:38.490
How's the new job going?

09:38.534 --> 09:39.709
It's fine.

09:39.753 --> 09:40.928
Making any of those
tough decisions yet?

Hey, Matt.

09:55.986 --> 09:57.074
Hey, Eric!

09:57.118 --> 09:58.946
Where in the world
did you get that?

09:58.989 --> 10:01.557
From a North Pole theme park
that went belly up.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.690
Why in the world
did you get that?

10:03.733 --> 10:06.649
To give the kids a spin
around the lot out front.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.564
And to drive it around town,

10:08.608 --> 10:09.521
you know, advertise the place
the little.

10:09.565 --> 10:10.827
It's actually
a good idea.

10:10.871 --> 10:11.872
It was Isabel's.

10:11.915 --> 10:12.916
All the good
ideas are.

10:12.960 --> 10:13.961
This guy... astute.

10:14.004 --> 10:15.658
You've trained
him well.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.834
My friend, Lucy,
is going to be in town again.

10:17.878 --> 10:19.488
She's visiting her family.

10:19.531 --> 10:21.446
She really enjoyed
her time with you last year.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.579
Three movies in one day, right?

10:23.623 --> 10:25.102
Ah, it was four,
with a dinner break.

10:25.146 --> 10:28.366
The holiday releases this year,
they look super good.

10:28.410 --> 10:29.977
You guys,
I told you.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.543
No more
casual dating.

10:31.587 --> 10:33.633
Okay, well, it's only casual
if it doesn't turn serious.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.678
It's not going
to turn serious with Lucy.

yourself back on the market.

10:46.341 --> 10:47.429
I can't.

10:47.472 --> 10:48.386
I meant it when I said "I do."

I really love our job.

11:38.045 --> 11:40.308
Mm. Amen.

11:40.351 --> 11:41.570
Of course, it's not
the job I dreamed of

11:41.613 --> 11:42.832
when I was a little girl.

11:42.876 --> 11:45.008
Well, ringmaster jobs
are hard to come by.

It's terrifying.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.894
when you were
in the CFO's office,

13:27.937 --> 13:29.678
did you happen to notice
any pictures

13:29.721 --> 13:30.810
of a wife or a girlfriend?

13:30.853 --> 13:31.854
I didn't.

13:31.898 --> 13:32.855
Because he is awfully...

to sample those yet?

they turned out okay.

You are all here.

13:56.705 --> 13:59.534
Yeah, what's going on?

13:59.577 --> 14:00.796
So this morning,

14:00.840 --> 14:04.495
um... there was a letter
waiting for me,

14:04.539 --> 14:06.802
from Human Resources,

14:06.846 --> 14:09.892
and there is no way
to soft-pedal this.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.894
Um...

I've been asked
to take an early retirement.

[Walt]: No!
Are you serious?

is instituting

some cost-cutting measures,

14:24.080 --> 14:27.910
and several senior staff
have been let go.

-Alice?
-Shelby. My supervisor.

14:38.399 --> 14:40.227
Uh, let me check.

14:40.270 --> 14:41.315
Oh, right.

14:41.358 --> 14:42.316
You don't know
who she is.

14:42.359 --> 14:43.317
You don't know
her name, obviously.

14:43.360 --> 14:44.840
That's the only explanation

14:44.884 --> 14:45.536
for why you could have done
something so unthinkable.

14:45.580 --> 14:47.843
Yeah... here she is.

14:49.932 --> 14:52.239
Look, I can see
that you're upset.

14:52.282 --> 14:54.981
Alice is one of the hospital's
guiding lights, okay?

14:55.024 --> 14:56.373
She's an inspiration!

14:56.417 --> 14:58.636
She has saved the lives
of scores of babies.

14:58.680 --> 14:59.986
She has trained
I don't know how many nurses.

15:00.029 --> 15:02.336
Well, now,
hold on a minute, Jenny.

15:02.379 --> 15:03.293
I mean,
she's not the only person

15:03.337 --> 15:04.294
that we're letting go.

15:04.338 --> 15:06.209
There's a number
of people

15:06.253 --> 15:07.819
who are taking
early retirement

15:07.863 --> 15:09.778
in all departments,
even this one,

15:09.821 --> 15:11.214
and, may I add,

15:11.258 --> 15:12.563
with a severance
and a full pension.

15:12.607 --> 15:14.957
The hospital's finances
are really that bad?

15:15.001 --> 15:16.611
Yeah... they are.

15:16.654 --> 15:18.526
That's why I'm here.

15:18.569 --> 15:20.876
Brockman, he didn't want
to do what had to be done.

15:22.051 --> 15:23.835
So they hired a hatchet man.

15:23.879 --> 15:24.967
They hired someone

15:25.011 --> 15:28.014
who is not afraid
to make tough decisions.

15:28.057 --> 15:30.625
The hospital has to make cuts.

15:30.668 --> 15:32.148
The numbers simply don't add up.

15:32.192 --> 15:33.976
Alice isn't a number.

15:34.020 --> 15:34.934
She's a person.

15:37.762 --> 15:39.808
I'm sorry
that it had to happen.

15:39.851 --> 15:41.331
Did it have to happen
right before Christmas?

15:59.697 --> 16:01.090
[Alice talking quietly]

16:04.528 --> 16:06.356
Hi. Is everything okay?

16:06.400 --> 16:07.444
Yeah, a new arrival.

16:07.488 --> 16:08.968
A boy.

16:09.011 --> 16:11.535
He's 32 weeks,
just under three pounds.

16:11.579 --> 16:12.841
Complications?

16:12.884 --> 16:13.885
No red flags yet.

16:13.929 --> 16:14.974
He's stable,

16:15.017 --> 16:17.889
and here, signing his chart...

16:19.587 --> 16:20.762
And could you bring
the parents down?

16:20.805 --> 16:22.111
OB just released the mother.

16:22.155 --> 16:23.286
Yeah, of course.

16:23.330 --> 16:24.070
Thanks.

16:30.902 --> 16:31.903
Mr. and Mrs. Bradley?

16:33.993 --> 16:35.168
How is he?

16:35.211 --> 16:37.257
He's fine.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.346
Yeah, he's breathing
easily, with help.

16:39.389 --> 16:40.608
His heartbeat is steady.

16:40.651 --> 16:41.783
When can
we see him?

16:41.826 --> 16:43.567
Now.

16:43.611 --> 16:44.829
I'm Jenny Miller.

16:44.873 --> 16:46.353
I work in the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit,

16:46.396 --> 16:47.310
and your son...

16:47.354 --> 16:48.746
James.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.357
His names is James.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.923
It's a beautiful name.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.142
James is there
right now,

16:53.186 --> 16:54.448
and the best doctors
and nurses in the world

16:54.491 --> 16:55.753
are giving him
their full attention,

16:55.797 --> 16:57.538
so let's go say hi.

17:00.976 --> 17:02.151
[Alice]: We don't have
to tell you this,

17:02.195 --> 17:03.326
but James was born

17:03.370 --> 17:05.285
a little more
than eight weeks early.

17:05.328 --> 17:07.069
Why?

17:07.113 --> 17:08.592
We don't know why.

17:08.636 --> 17:09.723
The truth is,

17:09.767 --> 17:11.638
1 in 13 babies
are born prematurely.

17:11.682 --> 17:14.337
And James was
particularly eager

17:14.381 --> 17:15.556
to make an appearance.

17:15.598 --> 17:16.948
[Jenny]: Yeah, you got
a real go-getter here.

17:16.992 --> 17:17.949
[Alice]: But
the problem is,

17:17.992 --> 17:20.909
when a baby is born early,

17:20.952 --> 17:25.608
it doesn't have as much baby fat
as if you were full-term.

17:25.653 --> 17:28.960
Besides making babies huggable
and just adorable,

17:29.004 --> 17:32.529
baby fat helps keep him warm
and prevents excess water loss.

17:32.573 --> 17:35.010
So that's our main
focus right now,

17:35.054 --> 17:37.186
to keep James
warm and hydrated,

17:37.230 --> 17:39.058
until he can do it
on his own.

17:39.101 --> 17:40.755
That's why he's
in the incubator.

17:40.798 --> 17:42.017
For how long?

17:42.061 --> 17:45.412
Well, I wish
that I could say for certain,

17:45.455 --> 17:47.066
but it will probably be
a few weeks.

17:47.109 --> 17:49.546
Will we be able
to hold him?

17:49.590 --> 17:52.201
Not just yet,

17:52.245 --> 17:53.463
but you can see
the incubator is designed

17:53.507 --> 17:55.030
so you can touch him,

17:55.074 --> 17:56.901
and as soon as pediatrics
gives us the go-ahead,

17:56.945 --> 17:58.555
you will,

17:58.599 --> 17:59.861
and for however long
James needs to be here,

17:59.904 --> 18:02.516
you guys can be
right by his side, 24-7.

18:03.604 --> 18:04.996
We will.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.087
[Father]: If we're going
to be spending

18:08.130 --> 18:10.001
so much quality time together...

18:10.045 --> 18:12.352
then please,
call me Dan.

18:12.395 --> 18:13.396
And Selena.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.137
Dan and Selena.

18:15.181 --> 18:18.488
Welcome
to your new temporaryhome.

18:18.532 --> 18:20.142
Um, if you want,

18:20.186 --> 18:21.839
you can go in
and get closer.

18:33.721 --> 18:35.418
How are you doing?

18:35.462 --> 18:37.464
That was some pretty
rough news this morning.

18:37.507 --> 18:39.292
Absorbing.

18:40.554 --> 18:42.251
The hospital is abuzz.

18:42.295 --> 18:46.473
Apparently, a dozen people
"retiring early."

18:46.516 --> 18:48.910
Yeah, well, you're not
going to be one of them.

18:48.953 --> 18:50.999
But if I am,
it's okay.

18:51.042 --> 18:52.740
No, that's not okay!

18:52.783 --> 18:55.046
Well, nothing
lasts forever, Jen.

18:55.090 --> 18:56.874
It... change is inevitable.

18:59.355 --> 19:00.617
Well...

19:00.661 --> 19:01.836
what are we going
to do without you?

19:03.881 --> 19:07.537
You will be fine,
just like you were today,

19:07.581 --> 19:09.235
because I trained you well.

19:09.278 --> 19:11.106
What will you do without us?

19:13.064 --> 19:14.675
Travel,

19:14.718 --> 19:18.374
and read all those books that
I've been meaning to get to...

19:18.418 --> 19:19.593
and finally spend
some more time

19:19.636 --> 19:21.029
with my brother and his family.

19:21.072 --> 19:23.118
[Jenny]: Well, I guess
Dudley's going to be happy

19:23.162 --> 19:24.902
to have you around more.

19:24.946 --> 19:26.077
Well, I hope so,

19:26.121 --> 19:26.904
because he has
a really big crush

19:26.948 --> 19:28.428
on his dog walker.

19:31.431 --> 19:33.998
Don't worry about me, Jen.

19:34.042 --> 19:36.479
This could be the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

19:36.523 --> 19:37.828
Okay.

19:41.441 --> 19:43.965
Wow, your angels are still
sending you Christmas cards.

19:46.489 --> 19:47.664
Yes, they are so thoughtful.

19:53.975 --> 19:55.368
It's incredible.

20:01.156 --> 20:03.332
[Jenny]:
It's a party for nurses.

20:03.376 --> 20:04.246
You know, they're hard-working,

20:04.290 --> 20:06.640
underpaid...

20:06.683 --> 20:07.989
Yeah, I'm hardworking
and underpaid.

20:08.032 --> 20:09.295
But look at how much
I'm buying, though!

20:09.338 --> 20:12.254
Discounts
on advertised items only.

20:12.298 --> 20:13.255
Come on, Chris...

20:13.299 --> 20:15.475
can I call you Chris?

20:15.518 --> 20:16.693
I'm on a really tight
budget here.

20:16.737 --> 20:18.739
You know,
I can actually verify that.

20:18.782 --> 20:20.915
There was a tight-fisted,
bean-counting Scrooge,

20:20.958 --> 20:22.743
just slashed it to shreds.

20:22.786 --> 20:24.571
This is not my problem.

20:24.614 --> 20:26.050
You know what?

20:26.094 --> 20:27.965
Community Memorial
is a non-profit,

20:28.009 --> 20:29.706
so any sort of discount
that the store wants to give

20:29.750 --> 20:31.055
would be considered
a tax write-off.

20:31.099 --> 20:32.318
Are you authorized
to take donations

20:32.361 --> 20:33.362
on behalf of the hospital?

20:33.406 --> 20:35.364
No, but he is.

20:35.408 --> 20:37.279
I am.

20:37.323 --> 20:40.935
I am because I am
the CFO of the hospital.

20:44.025 --> 20:44.895
There's a form for that.

20:44.939 --> 20:45.940
I'll be right back.

20:45.983 --> 20:47.158
-Thanks, Chris.
-Great.

20:47.202 --> 20:49.248
Uh, you're welcome.

20:50.901 --> 20:52.512
Thank you.

20:52.555 --> 20:53.817
Wow...

20:53.861 --> 20:56.472
That's a pretty--
that's a pretty cold shoulder.

20:56.516 --> 20:57.778
Let me see.
Is this...?

20:57.821 --> 20:58.648
Nope, not going to find
that one any warmer.

20:58.692 --> 20:59.606
It's pretty frosty, too.

20:59.649 --> 21:00.911
You know what?

21:00.955 --> 21:02.173
I get that you're trying
to be funny right now.

21:02.217 --> 21:03.218
I'm bringing
my best stuff here.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.132
I'm not going
to take the bait.

21:04.175 --> 21:05.176
Why...
a little bit, you are.

21:05.220 --> 21:06.221
Little bit.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.744
I told you how I feel

21:07.788 --> 21:09.224
about what you're doing
at the hospital this morning.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.747
Jenny,
my job is not me.

21:10.791 --> 21:11.661
Well, mine is.

21:12.923 --> 21:14.142
I got the--
uh, form.

21:14.185 --> 21:15.796
Awesome.

21:15.839 --> 21:16.797
That's... thank you.

21:20.453 --> 21:22.324
There's no way
you can keep Alice on?

21:22.368 --> 21:23.325
There really isn't.

21:23.369 --> 21:24.326
I'm sorry.

21:24.370 --> 21:25.371
Why not?

21:25.414 --> 21:27.155
Uh, well, first,
it wouldn't be fair

21:27.198 --> 21:28.809
to the other people
that we're letting go.

21:28.852 --> 21:30.245
You know, I'm sure

21:30.289 --> 21:32.029
their departments are upset
that they're leaving, too.

21:32.073 --> 21:32.900
And that doesn't bother you?

21:35.468 --> 21:36.730
Tell you what...

21:36.773 --> 21:39.385
how about we not talk
about this anymore?

21:39.428 --> 21:41.952
You see things your way,
I see things my way.

21:41.996 --> 21:42.953
Fine.

21:45.260 --> 21:46.653
What's with all
these canned goods?

21:46.696 --> 21:48.045
You planning on hibernating
for the winter?

21:49.438 --> 21:51.701
No, my church puts together
Christmas baskets

21:51.745 --> 21:52.659
for needy families.

21:54.530 --> 21:55.923
Hmm.

21:55.966 --> 21:57.446
The softer side of Scrooge.

21:57.490 --> 21:59.318
Well, I have to do good works.

21:59.361 --> 22:00.797
I'm not saving lives
like you are.

22:00.841 --> 22:02.321
That is right.

22:02.364 --> 22:04.453
If you give me a second,
I'll help you load your car.

22:04.497 --> 22:06.368
I think I can manage.

22:06.412 --> 22:08.414
Hey, if you need
anything else,

22:08.457 --> 22:11.242
any other, you know,
help with the party,

22:11.286 --> 22:13.288
let me know.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.594
Have a nice day, Jenny Miller.

22:15.812 --> 22:16.770
Bye.

22:25.866 --> 22:26.954
[Walt]: Hey!

22:26.997 --> 22:28.869
I had one of these
when I was a kid.

22:28.912 --> 22:30.000
-Me, too.
-Seriously?

22:30.044 --> 22:31.567
Yeah, I had a whole
fleet of them.

22:31.611 --> 22:32.873
It was
for her imaginary circus.

22:32.916 --> 22:34.265
Lucky.

22:34.309 --> 22:35.789
I just had the one.

22:35.832 --> 22:38.748
Those would be perfect
for the holiday grab bags.

22:38.792 --> 22:41.011
So, guys, I've been thinking...

22:41.055 --> 22:42.839
this is going to be
Alice's last Christmas party.

22:42.883 --> 22:44.754
Oh, thanks
for reminding us.

22:46.016 --> 22:48.758
But what if we make the party
all about her?

22:48.802 --> 22:50.151
A celebration of Alice!

22:50.194 --> 22:51.326
She'll never go for that.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.414
She hates
being the center of attention.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.373
So we don't tell her.

22:54.416 --> 22:55.461
A surprise party!

22:55.504 --> 22:56.897
Cool.

22:56.940 --> 22:58.464
I'll DJ, by the way...
free of charge.

22:58.507 --> 23:01.554
Thanks, pal!
So, this is my idea.

23:01.597 --> 23:02.946
You know how she gets all
those Christmas cards every year

23:02.990 --> 23:04.513
from families
of former patients?

23:04.557 --> 23:05.688
Mm-hmm.

23:05.732 --> 23:07.342
Think of how many families
there are,

23:07.386 --> 23:08.604
how many more patients.

23:08.648 --> 23:10.432
What if everybody sent her
a Christmas card?

23:10.476 --> 23:13.217
Well, a lot of them do.

23:13.261 --> 23:14.523
Yeah, but there are
plenty more that don't,

23:14.567 --> 23:16.482
so if we could
somehow find them

23:16.525 --> 23:17.787
and tell them
that Alice is leaving

23:17.831 --> 23:19.354
and encourage them
to send a card...

23:19.398 --> 23:20.442
We could get
a huge tree.

23:20.486 --> 23:22.444
We could hang
all the cards on it.

23:22.488 --> 23:23.837
I was on the team

23:23.880 --> 23:25.795
that computerized
our records last year.

23:25.839 --> 23:27.841
It'd be real easy for me
to put together a database.

23:27.884 --> 23:29.712
-Really, you could do that?
-Oh, you bet.

23:29.756 --> 23:30.887
You know what?

23:30.931 --> 23:32.019
We'll have the cards
sent to our place.

23:32.062 --> 23:34.282
That way,
Alice doesn't ever see them.

23:34.325 --> 23:35.631
That's perfect...

23:35.675 --> 23:37.677
but guys, we only have 16 days
till the party,

23:37.720 --> 23:39.287
so we've got to get
a move on...

23:39.330 --> 23:40.462
and also...

23:40.506 --> 23:41.420
it's a surprise, guys.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.424
Thank you.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.015
Hey, pal.

24:13.103 --> 24:14.627
Me too.

24:32.514 --> 24:34.124
[Matt]: Hey, sis.

24:35.517 --> 24:37.040
I'm good. You?

24:38.433 --> 24:39.652
That's great.

24:39.695 --> 24:41.001
Hey, I got a quick question
for you and Eric

24:41.044 --> 24:42.263
about your holiday schedule.

24:44.265 --> 24:45.614
[elevator dings]

24:45.658 --> 24:47.616
Morning!

24:47.660 --> 24:49.270
Oh, good morning!
Oh, Jenny!

24:49.313 --> 24:51.490
That database
is in your in-box.

24:51.533 --> 24:52.578
Oh, thank you.

24:54.580 --> 24:56.320
Thank you for wrapping
all those grab bag presents.

24:56.364 --> 24:57.931
Yeah, my pleasure.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.335
Selena.

25:11.379 --> 25:12.511
Dan, hi.

25:12.554 --> 25:13.860
-Hi.
-Good morning.

25:13.903 --> 25:15.557
How was your night?

25:15.601 --> 25:16.645
Restless.

25:16.689 --> 25:17.820
We kept
waking up to check on him,

25:17.864 --> 25:19.300
make sure he was okay.

25:19.343 --> 25:21.345
Well, you would be doing that if
you were at home, too.

25:21.389 --> 25:22.564
[Selena]: I know,
but at home,

25:22.608 --> 25:24.566
I could take him to bed with us.

25:24.610 --> 25:25.785
It's hard having
him so close

25:25.828 --> 25:27.569
and not being able
to hold him.

25:27.613 --> 25:28.614
We so want to bond with him.

25:28.657 --> 25:30.485
You will.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.356
I promise...

25:32.400 --> 25:33.880
and I would know.
I was born prematurely.

25:33.923 --> 25:35.055
You were?

25:35.098 --> 25:36.665
Mm-hmm.

25:36.709 --> 25:40.887
I spent almost three weeks
in an incubator,

25:40.930 --> 25:42.802
and my mother and I couldn't
possibly be more bonded.

25:47.197 --> 25:50.418
The babies we nurse,
we call them our angels,

25:50.461 --> 25:51.854
and we have a special mantra,

25:51.898 --> 25:53.290
courtesy of Alice.

25:55.118 --> 25:57.077
"We treasure our angels

25:57.120 --> 25:59.253
by each precious beat
of their hearts."

26:00.515 --> 26:01.429
That's beautiful.

26:03.910 --> 26:06.695
James is getting stronger
with each of his heartbeats,

26:06.739 --> 26:08.523
and if we have anything
to say about it,

26:08.567 --> 26:10.046
there's going to be
a couple billion more ahead.

26:13.397 --> 26:14.529
Matt!

26:14.573 --> 26:16.313
Sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

26:16.357 --> 26:17.837
Can I help you?

26:17.880 --> 26:19.926
Yeah, I was hoping
to talk to you for a minute.

26:21.144 --> 26:22.319
Sure. Excuse me.

26:24.670 --> 26:26.019
Talk to me about what?

26:26.062 --> 26:27.934
Have you found a place,
a venue for your party yet?

26:27.977 --> 26:29.413
No, but I'm working on it.

26:29.457 --> 26:31.981
Okay, I think that I found
a fantastic place.

26:33.374 --> 26:34.680
I really don't need
your help, Matt.

26:34.723 --> 26:36.769
I know you don't,
but this place is perfect.

26:36.812 --> 26:38.379
I think you just
need to see it.

26:38.422 --> 26:40.511
It's five minutes
from the hospital.

26:40.555 --> 26:42.513
You're going to ask
for Isabel, or Eric.

26:44.385 --> 26:46.039
That was really sweet,
by the way.

26:46.082 --> 26:46.996
What was?

26:47.040 --> 26:48.911
What you said
to that couple.

26:48.955 --> 26:50.260
Sweet.

26:53.699 --> 26:55.091
[children yelling]

27:00.009 --> 27:01.228
[train whistle toots]

27:12.587 --> 27:13.849
Hi.

27:17.548 --> 27:19.028
Hi!

27:19.072 --> 27:20.247
Hi.

27:20.290 --> 27:21.640
Welcome
to Forever Young At Heart.

27:21.683 --> 27:22.684
This place is amazing!

27:22.728 --> 27:24.599
I've never seen
anything like it.

27:24.643 --> 27:25.731
Exactly.

27:25.774 --> 27:26.819
Um, are you Isabel?

27:26.862 --> 27:28.734
Matt Crawford
suggested I drop by.

27:28.777 --> 27:30.692
Oh, right, yes,
you must be Jenny.

27:30.736 --> 27:31.998
Yes!

27:32.041 --> 27:32.999
Nice to meet you.

27:33.042 --> 27:34.217
You, too.

27:34.261 --> 27:35.871
So is this the venue?

27:35.915 --> 27:37.003
Yep.

27:37.046 --> 27:38.265
I'd give you
the grand tour,

27:38.308 --> 27:41.964
but as you can see,
it's one big happy place.

27:42.008 --> 27:43.009
Oh, I'll say.

27:44.140 --> 27:45.620
Now, your rental rate is...?

27:45.664 --> 27:47.927
For you, we can do 50% off.

27:47.970 --> 27:49.711
That's our family discount.

27:49.755 --> 27:50.756
Matt and I are not...

27:50.799 --> 27:53.802
Oh, no, I'm...
I'm Matt's sister.

27:53.846 --> 27:55.108
He didn't mention that?

27:55.151 --> 27:56.675
He did not
mention that.

27:56.718 --> 27:57.763
He did not.

27:57.806 --> 27:59.025
It was a pretty
short conversation.

27:59.068 --> 28:01.288
I'm kind of mad
at your brother, actually.

28:01.331 --> 28:02.506
Oh, are you one of the people

28:02.550 --> 28:03.638
that he had to let go
from the hospital?

28:03.682 --> 28:05.988
No, no,
but my supervisor is,

28:06.032 --> 28:07.468
and then he went

28:07.511 --> 28:09.644
and slashed the budget
for this party.

28:09.688 --> 28:10.732
So he's trying
to help you out.

28:10.776 --> 28:12.865
Yeah, I guess,

28:12.908 --> 28:15.084
but I'd really rather he didn't.

28:15.128 --> 28:17.608
Did you want me
to charge you full price?

28:17.652 --> 28:19.132
Oh, no,
please don't.

28:19.175 --> 28:21.743
This is--
This is perfect.

28:21.787 --> 28:23.832
[talking quietly]

28:28.445 --> 28:30.839
[Jenny]: Uh, hey,
can you give me a minute?

28:30.883 --> 28:33.494
Oh... yeah.
Take two if you need it.

28:33.537 --> 28:34.625
Thanks.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.280
Hey.

28:37.324 --> 28:38.281
Hey!

28:41.067 --> 28:42.242
I wanted you to tell you

28:42.285 --> 28:44.244
that I went
to Forever Young At Heart today,

28:44.287 --> 28:45.158
and you're right.
It's perfect.

28:45.201 --> 28:46.246
Yeah. Good.

28:46.289 --> 28:47.551
I thought
that it would be.

28:47.595 --> 28:49.162
So I wanted to thank you
for the recommendation

28:49.205 --> 28:50.293
and for the discount.

28:50.337 --> 28:51.338
You're welcome.

28:51.381 --> 28:52.295
And then, I want
to just ask you

28:52.339 --> 28:54.341
to please stop helping me.

28:56.169 --> 28:57.823
Okay... why not?

28:57.866 --> 29:00.042
Because it's messed up.
You created a problem...

29:00.086 --> 29:01.217
Wait a second.
I didn't create anything.

29:01.261 --> 29:02.349
But I think
that you need to own up to it

29:02.392 --> 29:03.132
instead of trying
to make it up to me.

29:03.176 --> 29:04.786
Wow. Okay.

29:04.830 --> 29:08.181
Okay, I got that you were
strong-willed and passionate

29:08.224 --> 29:08.921
about the things
that you care about.

29:08.964 --> 29:10.139
I just missed

29:10.183 --> 29:11.662
the whole "world revolves
around me" thing.

29:11.706 --> 29:12.794
What is that supposed to mean?

29:12.838 --> 29:14.013
Jenny, look,

29:14.056 --> 29:15.710
I'm tired of you
trying to make me feel bad

29:15.754 --> 29:17.146
for doing what I have to do,

29:17.190 --> 29:19.105
for what the hospital
tasked me to do.

29:19.148 --> 29:20.584
I have to cut
the budget,

29:20.628 --> 29:21.847
and I am sorry

29:21.890 --> 29:23.065
that your friend, Alice,
is losing her job...

29:23.109 --> 29:24.371
She's so much
more than a friend.

29:24.414 --> 29:25.372
That really is a bad thing,

29:25.415 --> 29:26.547
but I'm not targeting Alice.

29:26.590 --> 29:27.548
I'm not targeting you.

29:27.591 --> 29:28.897
I'm not targeting anybody.

29:28.941 --> 29:31.421
I looked at the data,
I saw what I had to do,

29:31.465 --> 29:33.162
and I did it.

29:33.206 --> 29:36.905
Yeah.
You looked at the data.

29:36.949 --> 29:38.820
Is that all Alice is?

29:38.864 --> 29:39.778
Is that what I am?

29:39.821 --> 29:41.780
Wow.

30:03.802 --> 30:04.715
Sorry to keep you waiting.

30:04.759 --> 30:05.673
Oh, no worries.

30:08.502 --> 30:09.546
I always loved
that picture of you and Bob.

30:10.896 --> 30:13.637
Oh, yeah.
Me, too.

30:13.681 --> 30:17.554
That was from our "he swept me
off my feet" phase.

30:17.598 --> 30:19.121
Yeah, no kidding.

30:19.165 --> 30:21.471
That looks like a couple
crazy in love.

30:24.257 --> 30:26.215
Were you and my dad ever
that crazy about each other?

30:28.522 --> 30:30.045
I loved your father.

30:30.089 --> 30:31.481
I was devastated
when I lost him.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.877
I really wish
I could have known him.

30:35.921 --> 30:38.314
You would have
loved him, too.

30:38.358 --> 30:42.318
To have had that love,
and then have Bob...

30:42.362 --> 30:43.493
I'm incredibly lucky.

30:43.537 --> 30:45.756
Yeah.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.584
I wonder
if I'll ever get that lucky.

30:47.628 --> 30:49.325
Sure you will,
if you want it.

30:49.369 --> 30:51.980
I don't know about that.

30:52.024 --> 30:53.373
The older I get,

30:53.416 --> 30:55.288
the more I just feel
like I'm married to my work.

30:55.331 --> 30:57.290
Well, if that's what you want,

30:57.333 --> 30:59.596
there is nothing wrong
with that.

30:59.640 --> 31:02.121
Let's go.
Store closes at 8:00.

31:02.164 --> 31:03.339
The perfect gift, huh?

31:03.383 --> 31:04.558
I think so,

31:04.601 --> 31:05.602
but I'll let you
judge for yourself.

31:05.646 --> 31:06.560
Can't wait.

31:10.085 --> 31:11.173
[Jenny]:
When I was little,

31:11.217 --> 31:12.522
right after
you and Bob were married,

31:12.566 --> 31:14.350
he took me shopping
for my birthday,

31:14.394 --> 31:15.438
and he told me

31:15.482 --> 31:16.570
I could have
anything I wanted.

31:16.613 --> 31:17.658
I remember that.

31:17.701 --> 31:19.051
So while I was busy

31:19.094 --> 31:21.096
trying to figure out which
My Little Pony to get,

31:21.140 --> 31:23.359
he was captivated
by this train set,

31:23.403 --> 31:24.447
and he told me

31:24.491 --> 31:25.535
that it was all
he ever wanted

31:25.579 --> 31:26.623
when he was a boy,

31:26.667 --> 31:28.277
but his family
couldn't afford it.

31:28.321 --> 31:29.278
No, I'm sure
they couldn't have.

31:29.322 --> 31:30.540
So I kind of feel like

31:30.584 --> 31:32.586
you'd be making
a boyhood dream come true,

31:32.629 --> 31:33.848
you know,

31:33.892 --> 31:36.024
and what would be
more special for Christmas

31:36.068 --> 31:37.286
than that?

31:38.418 --> 31:39.288
We'll take this.

31:42.770 --> 31:44.728
[Jenny]:
How are you going to keep Bob

31:44.772 --> 31:45.947
from seeing that
before Christmas?

31:45.991 --> 31:48.602
[Kate]: I have
a special hiding place.

31:48.645 --> 31:50.343
I've been thinking

31:50.386 --> 31:51.997
about that conversation
we had earlier.

31:53.433 --> 31:55.565
Do you think
I'm married to my job?

31:57.480 --> 31:58.481
Do you?

31:58.525 --> 31:59.700
I don't know.

32:01.789 --> 32:03.008
I mean, I love my job.

32:03.051 --> 32:04.748
You know, it's what
I always wanted to do,

32:04.792 --> 32:07.012
but...

32:07.055 --> 32:08.230
sometimes, I feel
like there should be more.

32:08.274 --> 32:09.318
Well...

32:10.493 --> 32:11.625
are you dating?

32:11.668 --> 32:14.454
No! No.

32:14.497 --> 32:16.586
I mean, it's not like
anybody's asking me out, so...

32:16.630 --> 32:18.545
Well, it's
the 21st century, Jenny.

32:18.588 --> 32:20.025
You can do the asking.

32:20.068 --> 32:21.852
Yeah, and if there was
somebody that I really liked,

32:21.896 --> 32:23.071
I probably would,

32:23.115 --> 32:26.683
but... there isn't.

32:26.727 --> 32:29.643
Love has a very funny way
of sneaking up on you,

32:29.686 --> 32:31.819
and if you keep
your heart open,

32:31.862 --> 32:33.734
it just may surprise you.

32:40.175 --> 32:41.611
[Jenny]: Yeah.

32:43.004 --> 32:43.962
That's great.

32:44.005 --> 32:46.965
Okay, thank you.

32:47.008 --> 32:48.923
I have an appointment with
a potential caterer tomorrow.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.316
Francisco.

32:50.359 --> 32:51.882
Oh. "Francisco" who?

32:51.926 --> 32:53.884
Just "Francisco."

32:53.928 --> 32:56.061
Well that's good, yeah!
How'd you hear about him?

32:56.104 --> 32:57.584
Walt.

32:57.627 --> 32:59.586
He said that he catered
one of his friends' weddings,

32:59.629 --> 33:01.022
and it was scrumptious.

33:04.939 --> 33:07.159
Are all these for Alice?

33:07.202 --> 33:08.334
Yep.

33:08.377 --> 33:10.640
The e-mail went out,
like, two days ago!

33:10.684 --> 33:13.034
She's a popular lady.

33:13.078 --> 33:14.949
We're going to
need a big tree.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.037
Oh, yeah.

33:16.081 --> 33:19.562
Goji bean, mint,
and pumpkin seed.

33:19.606 --> 33:21.695
Now, that'll give you a taste
of how I prepare food.

33:21.738 --> 33:22.957
I can't predict

33:23.001 --> 33:24.089
what will be served
the night of your party.

33:24.132 --> 33:26.221
Oh, so there's no set menu?

33:26.265 --> 33:27.657
It depends on what ingredients
are available the day of.

33:27.701 --> 33:31.183
Seasonal and fresh...
that's my motto.

33:31.226 --> 33:32.749
Dig in.

33:32.793 --> 33:33.968
Thank you.

33:37.450 --> 33:39.060
Oh, my gosh!

33:39.104 --> 33:40.714
That's amazing,

33:40.757 --> 33:42.237
and I use that word sparingly.

33:43.499 --> 33:44.413
Thank you.

33:47.112 --> 33:48.939
Obviously, we'd love
for you to cater the party.

33:48.983 --> 33:50.985
Are you available
on the 20th?

33:51.029 --> 33:52.204
Ah, yeah.
I had a cancellation.

33:52.247 --> 33:53.596
That's great.

33:56.643 --> 33:57.557
This is my budget.

34:01.126 --> 34:03.258
I can't possibly do it
for this little.

34:03.302 --> 34:05.260
It's all I have to work with.

34:05.304 --> 34:06.914
This will barely cover
my costs.

34:06.957 --> 34:08.219
It's...

34:09.395 --> 34:11.049
Look, it's for a really
special group of people.

34:11.092 --> 34:13.355
It's, um...

34:13.399 --> 34:15.096
for the nursing staff
at Community Memorial,

34:15.139 --> 34:16.576
in the NICU.

34:16.619 --> 34:17.620
It's an acronym for...

34:17.664 --> 34:19.708
Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit.

34:19.753 --> 34:20.623
Yeah, exactly.

34:20.667 --> 34:22.581
At Community Memorial?

34:22.625 --> 34:24.714
Yeah, and we just don't have
the resources to...

34:24.757 --> 34:25.889
Mm.

34:27.500 --> 34:28.936
When I was a kid,

34:28.978 --> 34:30.806
my baby brother
was a patient there,

34:30.851 --> 34:32.199
and they saved
his life.

34:32.244 --> 34:33.679
Mm...

34:33.723 --> 34:36.074
It would be an honor
to cater your party.

34:36.117 --> 34:37.553
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

34:38.641 --> 34:39.599
Thank you.

34:39.641 --> 34:40.817
You're welcome.

34:42.036 --> 34:43.036
Yeah,
thank you so much.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.081
I can't wait!

34:44.125 --> 34:44.995
Oh! I'm sorry!

34:46.257 --> 34:47.433
-Hi.
-Hi.

34:47.476 --> 34:49.130
It's you.

34:49.174 --> 34:50.088
All right,
I'm not following you.

34:50.130 --> 34:51.524
I swear.

34:51.567 --> 34:52.525
I'm Christmas shopping.

34:52.568 --> 34:53.569
And I was just meeting

34:53.612 --> 34:54.483
with the caterer
for the party.

34:54.527 --> 34:56.964
Oh, Francisco's!

34:57.007 --> 34:58.183
I know him.

34:58.226 --> 34:59.401
He catered my aunt's 60th.

34:59.445 --> 35:01.229
His food was the highlight
of the party.

35:03.188 --> 35:05.625
Hey, Jenny Miller...

35:05.668 --> 35:06.843
last time I saw you,

35:06.887 --> 35:08.671
I said some things
that I'm sorry about.

35:08.715 --> 35:10.369
I was out of line.

35:12.022 --> 35:12.980
Well, maybe I was, too.

35:13.023 --> 35:14.634
I mean, it's no excuse,

35:14.677 --> 35:15.678
but my job sometimes,

35:15.722 --> 35:17.680
it makes me
insensitive...

35:17.724 --> 35:18.812
Or, if you believe
my sister Isabel,

35:18.855 --> 35:20.161
I'm too sensitive,

35:20.205 --> 35:21.945
and so then, I try to find ways
to compensate.

35:21.989 --> 35:24.296
Like with a cartful
of canned goods?

35:24.339 --> 35:27.908
Yeah, or saving poinsettias
for a damsel in distress.

35:27.951 --> 35:30.824
Oh, I'm not a damsel,
and I'm not in distress.

35:30.867 --> 35:32.130
That's good,

35:32.173 --> 35:33.653
because my jousting dragons
skills are rusty.

35:35.350 --> 35:36.438
Um...

35:36.482 --> 35:38.788
Well, I should
get back to work.

35:38.832 --> 35:39.789
Yeah, me, too.

35:39.833 --> 35:41.878
Yeah.

35:41.922 --> 35:44.229
-Are you...
-Same... way.

35:46.883 --> 35:47.841
[Matt]: Amazing.
His food is exceptional.

35:47.884 --> 35:49.364
He uses all, like,
table stuff.

35:49.408 --> 35:50.452
And at cost!

35:50.496 --> 35:52.193
And he's doing
it at cost?

35:52.237 --> 35:53.977
That's very generous of him.

35:54.021 --> 35:55.065
I know.

35:55.109 --> 35:57.416
I'm not surprised, though.

35:57.459 --> 35:59.113
The things we do at Memorial,

35:59.157 --> 36:02.421
they have a very profound impact
on people's lives.

36:02.464 --> 36:03.857
And nobody does it better
than Alice.

36:03.900 --> 36:05.250
Well, they don't.

36:05.293 --> 36:06.381
All right, you're not
going to believe me,

36:06.425 --> 36:09.863
but if I could save Alice's job,
I would.

36:09.906 --> 36:11.169
I would save everybody's.

36:11.212 --> 36:13.214
You're right.
I don't believe you.

36:13.258 --> 36:15.216
Listen, Jenny,
in the real world, sometimes,

36:15.260 --> 36:17.087
you've got to make
tough decisions

36:17.131 --> 36:18.088
for the greater good,

36:18.132 --> 36:19.133
and it's not always fun.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.874
So you're a realist,
and I'm not.

36:20.917 --> 36:21.918
No, no.

36:21.962 --> 36:22.876
What I'm saying

36:22.919 --> 36:24.138
is that you see
your reality

36:24.182 --> 36:26.445
from a very certain angle.

36:26.488 --> 36:27.837
You're clear about that.

36:27.881 --> 36:28.882
You know your mind,

36:28.925 --> 36:29.839
and you stick
to your guns.

36:29.883 --> 36:30.840
Well, so do you.

36:30.884 --> 36:32.015
So see?

36:32.059 --> 36:33.887
We're not that different,
Jenny Miller.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.891
All right, I've got
a serious question for you.

36:37.934 --> 36:38.761
Do you have
a Christmas tree yet

36:38.805 --> 36:39.936
for your Christmas party?

36:39.980 --> 36:42.330
No, and we're going
to need a big one.

36:42.374 --> 36:45.203
Okay, I know
where you can get a great tree.

36:45.246 --> 36:46.552
Of course you do.

36:46.595 --> 36:47.596
No, no.

36:47.640 --> 36:48.945
I'm saying,

36:48.989 --> 36:51.383
I know where you can get
a truly unbelievable tree

36:51.426 --> 36:53.211
for a truly unbelievable price.

36:53.254 --> 36:54.212
Yeah?

36:56.388 --> 36:57.911
Are you going to make me
ask where?

36:57.954 --> 36:59.695
No, I'm going to make you
come with me to go get it.

36:59.739 --> 37:00.827
Matt...

37:00.870 --> 37:02.481
Come on,
we've got a nice thing going.

37:02.524 --> 37:03.699
I don't want
to break up the momentum.

37:03.743 --> 37:04.961
[phone chimes]

37:05.005 --> 37:05.919
Jenny, I didn't come
to Community

37:05.962 --> 37:06.920
to make enemies...

37:08.400 --> 37:11.185
especially not somebody
like you.

37:11.229 --> 37:12.273
Come with me.
Get to know me.

37:12.317 --> 37:15.320
See that I'm not
such a bad guy.

37:15.363 --> 37:17.757
Oh, I've got
to get back to the hospital.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.280
Is everything okay?

37:19.324 --> 37:21.804
I don't know...
uh, bye!

37:21.848 --> 37:22.979
Bye, Jenny.

37:26.331 --> 37:27.723
[Jenny]: Hey.

37:27.767 --> 37:28.942
Hey, um,
they're with Alice.

37:32.337 --> 37:33.599
[Alice]: So we did,

37:33.642 --> 37:35.253
and, of course,
you were our first call.

37:35.296 --> 37:36.341
[knocks gently]

37:36.384 --> 37:38.038
Hi. I got here
as fast as I could.

37:38.081 --> 37:42.129
I was just walking
the Bradleys through this.

37:42.172 --> 37:44.000
It's James' heart.

37:44.044 --> 37:46.307
It's common
with pre-term infants.

37:46.351 --> 37:47.917
And the doctor
performing the surgery

37:47.961 --> 37:49.919
is the absolute best.

37:49.963 --> 37:52.487
She's done this procedure
hundreds of times.

37:52.531 --> 37:53.662
Successfully.

37:54.968 --> 37:57.275
The best place for James to be
is right here.

37:59.799 --> 38:01.627
When will the doctor
do the surgery?

38:01.670 --> 38:03.063
First thing Monday morning.

38:04.804 --> 38:05.718
The 16th.

38:07.502 --> 38:08.547
Her birthday.

38:10.940 --> 38:11.898
Can we be there
with James?

38:12.986 --> 38:14.509
No...

38:14.553 --> 38:16.816
but I will be with you,

38:16.859 --> 38:17.730
every moment.

38:34.399 --> 38:35.835
All right.
Turn on the juice.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.144
Wow!

38:41.188 --> 38:42.450
Ho, ho, ho!

38:42.494 --> 38:43.886
[Bob]: How does it look?

38:43.930 --> 38:45.453
-Fabulous.
-You nailed it, Bob.

38:47.150 --> 38:48.674
Hey, wait a minute.
Where's Rudolph?

38:49.718 --> 38:51.851
Rudolf's not here?

38:51.894 --> 38:53.026
No, he isn't.

38:53.069 --> 38:54.462
Ah, he must be in the house
somewhere.

38:54.506 --> 38:55.420
I'll go get him.

38:57.247 --> 38:58.553
Where'd you hide him?

38:58.597 --> 39:00.773
In the garage,
behind a few boxes.

39:00.816 --> 39:02.340
Maybe he won't look there.

39:02.383 --> 39:03.253
We can hope.

39:05.081 --> 39:06.953
How is Christmas
party planning?

39:06.996 --> 39:08.041
Oh, it's coming along.

39:08.084 --> 39:09.564
We're going to go
get a tree tomorrow.

39:09.608 --> 39:11.087
Oh, you need
some help?

39:11.131 --> 39:12.872
No, somebody from work
is helping.

39:12.915 --> 39:15.135
Oh, uh, Lauren?

39:15.178 --> 39:16.310
Uh, Matt.
His name's Matt.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.660
You haven't mentioned Matt.

39:18.704 --> 39:20.140
Well, that's 'cause
he just started working there.

39:20.183 --> 39:21.402
In NICU?

39:21.446 --> 39:23.230
Business affairs.

39:23.273 --> 39:25.014
You know him well enough
to buy a Christmas tree already?

39:25.058 --> 39:26.755
Mom...

39:26.799 --> 39:28.409
He's just a friend.

39:28.453 --> 39:29.497
Where'd you meet him?

39:29.541 --> 39:32.413
At the hospital,
where we both work.

39:32.457 --> 39:34.110
Oh. Someone introduced you?

39:34.154 --> 39:35.634
Mom!

39:35.677 --> 39:36.635
Sorry, am I asking
too many questions?

39:36.678 --> 39:38.201
You think?

39:40.856 --> 39:42.031
Don't you think
Bob did a great job?

39:42.075 --> 39:44.033
[Jenny]: Yeah...

39:44.077 --> 39:46.645
and you know what?
I think I do miss Rudolph.

39:46.688 --> 39:47.994
Me too.

39:55.871 --> 39:59.092
Crawford's Hauling and Delivery

40:00.441 --> 40:01.877
Is this yours?

40:01.921 --> 40:03.488
Eric's. It's for hauling
all that playground equipment.

40:05.272 --> 40:06.447
It looks like
it could scale Mt. Everest.

40:06.491 --> 40:08.971
Which will come in handy
where we're going.

40:10.408 --> 40:11.583
'Kay, where are we going?

40:11.626 --> 40:13.062

This is beautiful.

40:40.002 --> 40:41.221
I know,

40:41.264 --> 40:43.658
and it's only an hour
outside of the city.

40:43.702 --> 40:45.617
Wow. I've never even
been up here.

40:45.660 --> 40:47.270
Most people haven't.

40:47.314 --> 40:48.794
You know, I used to hike here
when I was a little kid.

40:48.837 --> 40:50.360
Seems pretty
off the beaten track

40:50.404 --> 40:51.753
for a Christmas
tree farm, though.

40:53.015 --> 40:55.322
Who said anything
about a Christmas tree farm?

40:55.365 --> 40:56.976
Wait. What?

40:59.544 --> 41:00.719
We're cutting down a tree?

41:00.762 --> 41:03.025
Yeah, this place is
crawling with them.

41:03.069 --> 41:05.201
Yeah, but
isn't that illegal?

41:05.245 --> 41:06.202
Not if you
have a permit.

41:07.987 --> 41:10.032
And do we have a permit?

41:10.076 --> 41:12.078
Jenny Miller, do you
not know me by now?

41:13.906 --> 41:15.211
Of course, we have a permit!

41:15.255 --> 41:16.430
Of course, we have a permit.

41:19.520 --> 41:23.263
Uh, so am I supposed
to use these?

41:23.306 --> 41:24.612
You can
if you want to.

41:24.656 --> 41:25.744
I mean,
you don't have to.

41:25.787 --> 41:27.310
You can let me
do all the work,

41:27.354 --> 41:28.834
but I think that would be
out of character, Jenny Miller.

41:28.877 --> 41:30.096
You might be surprised.

41:30.139 --> 41:33.099
I'd like to be
surprised by you.

41:33.142 --> 41:34.666
Then again, it might be me
doing all the work,

41:34.709 --> 41:36.189

where to find a Christmas tree,

41:51.073 --> 41:52.161

41:52.205 --> 41:54.686

How 'bout that one?

43:05.452 --> 43:06.671
It's too small.

43:06.714 --> 43:08.411
Shape is good,
but it's too small.

It's too small.

you looking for?

I think I'm just going
to know when I see it.

that we were able
to get that tree to the truck.

44:57.477 --> 44:58.739
It's teamwork.

Strong ropes.

48:30.429 --> 48:31.778
We could.

48:31.821 --> 48:33.823
Great, so, um...

48:33.867 --> 48:34.955
I will meet you there
Monday at 8:00?

48:34.999 --> 48:36.217
Sure, why not?

48:36.261 --> 48:37.523
Then it's a...

48:39.264 --> 48:40.787
I'll see you then.

48:40.830 --> 48:42.876
Uh-huh, I will see you then.

49:21.480 --> 49:22.829
Oh, well...

49:37.061 --> 49:38.323
Does the operation
usually take this long?

49:38.366 --> 49:39.933
Yes.

49:39.977 --> 49:41.456
This is completely normal.

49:41.500 --> 49:43.632
I am sure that we're going
to hear something any moment.

49:44.982 --> 49:46.809
Oh!

49:46.853 --> 49:47.985
I almost forgot.

49:49.682 --> 49:51.205
Happy birthday.

49:51.249 --> 49:52.206
You shouldn't
have done that.

49:52.250 --> 49:53.207
Too late.
I already did.

49:53.251 --> 49:54.165
Thank you.

49:56.297 --> 49:57.168
[Jenny]:
It's a baby book.

49:58.778 --> 50:01.128
You can put pictures
of James in there.

50:01.172 --> 50:03.609
You can write down thoughts
as you watch him grow.

50:03.652 --> 50:04.566
Have you ever
kept a diary?

50:04.610 --> 50:05.654
No.

50:05.698 --> 50:07.743
I did.
Junior high.

50:09.093 --> 50:10.485
It's so funny
reading it now.

50:10.529 --> 50:12.009
All those thoughts
and feelings

50:12.052 --> 50:13.662
that were so monumental
at the time,

50:13.706 --> 50:15.664
I don't even...

50:15.708 --> 50:17.014
I don't even
remember them anymore.

50:18.580 --> 50:20.669
I don't think I could forget
how I'm feeling now.

50:20.713 --> 50:21.627
No, of course not.

50:21.670 --> 50:24.325
How could you?

50:24.369 --> 50:26.284
But writing about it
might help you get through it.

50:28.199 --> 50:29.852
Certainly helped me get through
junior high.

50:29.896 --> 50:32.420
Junior high was a bear,
that's for sure.

50:38.339 --> 50:40.776
[Doctor]: Everything
went very well.

50:53.920 --> 50:55.139
Hey! Hi!

50:55.182 --> 50:57.793
Oh, Eric!
Uh, Isabel!

50:57.837 --> 50:59.491
I didn't know that you guys
were going to be here.

50:59.534 --> 51:01.449
Surprise!
Double date.

51:01.493 --> 51:02.885
Oh, no! Uh, not a date.

51:02.929 --> 51:04.061
It's not a date!

51:04.104 --> 51:05.105
Right.

51:05.149 --> 51:07.064
Matt tells me

51:07.107 --> 51:08.587
that you're
an incredible skater.

51:08.630 --> 51:09.805
Apparently.

51:09.849 --> 51:11.155
I haven't seen her
on the ice yet, so...

51:11.198 --> 51:14.027
Matt'll give you
a run for your money.

51:14.071 --> 51:15.376
I did a little
hockey in college.

51:15.420 --> 51:16.464
Little?
All-state.

51:16.508 --> 51:18.379
Don't challenge him to a race.

51:18.423 --> 51:20.816
Well, I wasn't going to race.

51:20.860 --> 51:21.730
I was just going to skate.

51:21.774 --> 51:23.080
That's good...

51:23.123 --> 51:24.951
'cause I'd whoop you
out there.

51:26.170 --> 51:27.171
Oh, really?
That's interesting.

51:27.214 --> 51:28.998
And the gauntlet
has been thrown.

51:29.042 --> 51:30.565
Oh, my gosh.

51:30.609 --> 51:31.827
What?

51:31.871 --> 51:33.002
Alice!

51:33.046 --> 51:34.265
That's Alice Shelby?

51:34.308 --> 51:36.136
I'll be right back.

51:36.180 --> 51:37.355
Who's Alice Shelby?

51:37.398 --> 51:39.139
It's Jenny's
supervisor from work.

51:39.183 --> 51:40.271
The one you fired?

51:40.314 --> 51:41.620
Yeah.

51:41.663 --> 51:42.534
Awkward.

51:44.188 --> 51:45.189
Hi!

51:45.232 --> 51:46.712
Jenny!

51:46.755 --> 51:48.583
I didn't know
you skate!

51:48.627 --> 51:51.064
I don't,
but I've always wanted to.

51:51.108 --> 51:52.718
Now I have
the time to learn.

51:52.761 --> 51:54.111
Oh, right.

51:54.154 --> 51:55.286
Are you here alone?

51:55.329 --> 51:57.201
Yeah. You?

51:57.244 --> 51:59.768
Um... I'm just here
with some friends.

51:59.812 --> 52:01.030
Oh...

52:03.076 --> 52:05.122
Is that Matt Crawford?
The new CFO?

52:05.165 --> 52:07.124
Yeah, you guys have met?

52:07.167 --> 52:10.518
No. Someone pointed him
out to me in the cafeteria,

52:10.562 --> 52:11.737
but I would like to.
Introduce me.

52:11.780 --> 52:13.565
Well, okay.

52:13.608 --> 52:15.306
Um... Matt?

52:15.349 --> 52:17.699
Uh, Eric... Isabel...

52:17.743 --> 52:18.831
this is Alice.

52:18.874 --> 52:19.919
Hi.

52:19.962 --> 52:20.746
[Alice]:
Nice to meet you...

52:22.226 --> 52:23.531
and I'm not going
to be coy, Matt.

52:23.575 --> 52:24.445
I know who you are.

52:25.968 --> 52:27.013
Hi, Alice.

52:28.101 --> 52:29.058
[Isabel]:
Alice?

52:29.102 --> 52:30.059
It was nice to meet you.

52:30.103 --> 52:31.017
Yeah.
Nice meeting you.

52:31.060 --> 52:31.887
We're just...

52:31.931 --> 52:34.542
All right, have fun.

52:34.586 --> 52:35.717
Should I...
Should I go, too?

52:35.761 --> 52:37.241
Don't be silly.

52:37.284 --> 52:39.808
We all have
a job to do,

52:39.852 --> 52:40.896
and I lost mine

52:40.940 --> 52:42.333
just because
you were doing yours.

52:42.376 --> 52:43.464
That's life,

52:43.508 --> 52:45.945
and it really was
very nice to meet you.

52:47.816 --> 52:50.645
So, now I have to go
find my instructor,

52:50.689 --> 52:53.953
and when you see me
out there on the ice...

52:53.996 --> 52:54.954
don't laugh.

52:54.997 --> 52:55.955
Oh...

52:59.915 --> 53:02.135
Okay. Wow.

53:02.179 --> 53:03.049
I know.
I told you, she's amazing.

53:03.092 --> 53:04.398
I'm a believer.

53:04.442 --> 53:05.660
Are you having second thoughts
there, hatchet man?

53:05.704 --> 53:07.140
'Cause she may be
letting you off the hook,

53:07.184 --> 53:08.141
but I'm not.

53:08.185 --> 53:09.229
Yeah, see,

53:09.273 --> 53:10.970
I'd be disappointed
if you did.

53:11.013 --> 53:13.015
So, all-state hockey, hey?

53:13.059 --> 53:14.887
Long time ago.

53:14.930 --> 53:16.410
I'm way off my game.

53:16.454 --> 53:17.803
Well, let's find out.

53:21.372 --> 53:23.243
You're not going to out-race me
if you just stand there.

53:26.768 --> 53:29.206

53:29.249 --> 53:33.471

Ugh, you and me both.

54:11.291 --> 54:13.380
Hey, by the way,
I declare a tie.

54:13.424 --> 54:16.601
Oh, come on, Eric!
I totally won.

54:16.644 --> 54:18.907
Somebody's
in serious denial.

54:18.951 --> 54:20.996
Okay, it is not about
winning or losing.

54:21.040 --> 54:22.607
It is about
enjoying yourself.

54:22.650 --> 54:23.608
Right?

54:23.651 --> 54:24.739
Nah.

54:27.220 --> 54:29.875
I have really enjoyed
meeting you all,

54:29.918 --> 54:30.919
and I want to thank you

54:30.963 --> 54:32.878
for not knocking me over
out there.

54:32.921 --> 54:34.967
You are going to be
out-racing us soon.

54:35.010 --> 54:36.490
Well, I doubt that,

54:36.534 --> 54:39.145
but I can only get better,

54:39.188 --> 54:42.409
and it has been really great
to tackle something new.

54:42.453 --> 54:45.456
Come on.
I need my beauty rest.

54:45.499 --> 54:47.066
I've got
to get home, too.

54:47.109 --> 54:49.329
Dudley needs
his bedtime walk.

54:49.373 --> 54:50.504
Of course.

54:50.548 --> 54:51.636
I'll see you
in the morning.

54:51.679 --> 54:52.637
See you tomorrow.

54:52.680 --> 54:54.682
Goodnight, Matt.

54:54.726 --> 54:56.293
Goodnight, Alice.

54:56.336 --> 54:58.773
Come on, I'll walk you
to your car.

54:59.905 --> 55:02.211
Well, you were very good
at ice skating.

55:02.255 --> 55:04.213
Like, Michelle Kwan...

55:04.257 --> 55:06.128
Yeah, you weren't
so bad yourself.

55:06.172 --> 55:07.347
Thanks.

55:07.391 --> 55:09.784
Hey, I've been thinking...

55:09.828 --> 55:12.091
and I want to tell
you something.

55:12.134 --> 55:13.353
Um, I've been giving
a lot of thought

55:13.397 --> 55:14.223
to the hospital business...

55:14.267 --> 55:15.486
Hey!

55:15.529 --> 55:16.661
Sorry, about hospitals.

55:16.704 --> 55:18.097
Thank you.

55:18.140 --> 55:19.359
And what I've come to realize

55:19.403 --> 55:20.708
is that
we are in customer service.

55:20.752 --> 55:23.668
In fact, we are in the
ultimate customer service.

55:23.711 --> 55:24.799
How do you mean?

55:24.843 --> 55:26.148
Well, the way

55:26.192 --> 55:27.933
that doctors and nurses
and staff treat patients

55:27.976 --> 55:29.369
on a personal level

55:29.413 --> 55:30.936
is as important
as how they treat them

55:30.979 --> 55:31.893
on a medical level.

55:31.937 --> 55:33.199
That's for sure.

55:33.242 --> 55:35.288
It's all about
a deft touch and a big heart.

55:35.332 --> 55:36.594
Sure is.

55:36.637 --> 55:37.551
And meeting Alice tonight,

55:37.595 --> 55:40.380
and just for a few minutes, I...

55:40.424 --> 55:42.556
I see that she's all about
deft touch and a big heart.

55:42.600 --> 55:43.557
I get that,

55:43.601 --> 55:45.167
and losing her

55:45.211 --> 55:47.039
would be like losing
a lifetime of experience

55:47.082 --> 55:48.736
in quality customer service.

55:48.780 --> 55:50.956
That'd be hard
to replace.

55:50.999 --> 55:53.175
Wow.

55:53.219 --> 55:55.613
You really have been catching up
on the hospital business.

55:58.529 --> 56:00.400
It's nice...

56:00.444 --> 56:02.489
us not, you know, bumping heads,
or at least, not as often.

56:03.534 --> 56:04.578
Yeah.

56:04.622 --> 56:05.666
The headaches...

56:05.710 --> 56:06.885
It's like playing hockey again.

56:10.889 --> 56:12.238
All right, I've got to go.
It's getting late.

56:12.281 --> 56:13.761
Early morning tomorrow.

56:13.805 --> 56:15.154
Hey, when you're done
with your shift,

56:15.197 --> 56:16.416
maybe I pick you up,
take you out to dinner?

56:16.460 --> 56:18.549
Maybe we can finish
this conversation.

56:19.680 --> 56:21.160
Yeah, I'd like that.

56:21.203 --> 56:22.814
Good, then it's a plan.

56:22.857 --> 56:24.685
No, um...

56:24.729 --> 56:26.383
It's a date.

56:28.123 --> 56:30.169
[kisses]

56:30.212 --> 56:31.431
And I totally whupped you
on that ice today.

56:31.475 --> 56:32.432
[laughs]

56:32.476 --> 56:34.042
Goodnight, Jenny Miller.

56:34.086 --> 56:35.348
Night!

56:52.104 --> 56:53.627
Morning!

56:53.671 --> 56:54.759
Good morning!

56:54.802 --> 56:55.716
There's coffee.

56:55.760 --> 56:57.196
Ooh, thank you.

56:57.239 --> 56:58.458
You got in late last night.

56:58.502 --> 56:59.546
10:00?

56:59.590 --> 57:00.547
It's not that late.

57:00.591 --> 57:02.027
Uh, it is for you.

57:02.070 --> 57:05.073
That's a sad commentary
on my social life.

57:05.117 --> 57:06.423
Wait,
do you have a social life?

57:06.466 --> 57:08.860
I might.

57:08.903 --> 57:09.861
Tell me everything,
and leave out nothing.

57:09.904 --> 57:11.558
Ugh!

57:11.602 --> 57:12.516
I like him...

57:13.821 --> 57:16.998
and we're going out again
tonight, so...

57:17.042 --> 57:18.130
we'll see how it goes.

57:18.173 --> 57:21.568
Wow, you wild, romantic,
impetuous fools.

57:21.612 --> 57:23.178
Considering that I wanted
to throttle the guy

57:23.222 --> 57:24.397
two and a half weeks ago,

57:24.441 --> 57:27.052
I think we're moving
plenty fast enough.

57:27.095 --> 57:28.880
I think you should
stay out past 11:00,

57:28.923 --> 57:30.142
spread your wings
a little next time.

57:30.185 --> 57:31.273
Oh, my goodness!
Are these still coming in?

57:31.317 --> 57:32.579
Yeah... oh, I was
going to ask you,

57:32.623 --> 57:35.190
Should we take them
out of the envelope

57:35.234 --> 57:36.453
before we pin them to the tree?

57:36.496 --> 57:37.366
Otherwise,
it's going to take Alice forever

57:37.410 --> 57:39.586
to open all these.

57:39.630 --> 57:41.153
Mm, that's a good point.

57:41.196 --> 57:42.197
Yeah, do it.

57:42.241 --> 57:43.111
-Okay.
-[phone chimes]

57:44.548 --> 57:46.375
Is that Matt?

57:47.986 --> 57:49.509
No... it's Walt.

57:49.553 --> 57:50.902
Oh.

57:50.945 --> 57:52.730
Oh, he has
the night shift tonight,

57:52.773 --> 57:54.383
but the Pop Warner team
he coaches

57:54.427 --> 57:55.515
is having
its final game,

57:55.559 --> 57:57.474

you're not going to say yes.

57:59.084 --> 58:00.477
What? Of course I am.

58:00.520 --> 58:01.521
What about your date?

58:01.565 --> 58:03.480
My date can wait
'til tomorrow.

58:05.307 --> 58:06.526
Unless, of course,
you want to work tonight?

58:06.570 --> 58:08.528
Oh, um, yeah.

58:08.572 --> 58:09.877

at the hospital.

58:21.976 --> 58:24.762
You know, I was always more
of a Tara Lipinski fan myself.

58:24.805 --> 58:27.199
Hey, listen,
I can't do dinner tonight.

58:27.242 --> 58:28.330
I have to work.

58:28.374 --> 58:30.724
Oh, that's okay.
How about lunch instead?

58:30.768 --> 58:32.726
Ooh, I can't.
I have lunch with my mom.

58:32.770 --> 58:34.902

58:34.946 --> 58:36.730
Yeah, tomorrow night.

Hi, uh, I'm trying
to reach Jenny Miller.

59:00.319 --> 59:01.929
This is Jenny Miller.

59:01.973 --> 59:03.757
Hi. My name is Greg Carter.

59:03.801 --> 59:04.802
You don't know me,

59:04.845 --> 59:07.718
but, um... I got your e-mail

59:07.761 --> 59:09.284
about Alice Shelby's
retirement party.

59:09.328 --> 59:11.548
I'm one of her angels.

59:11.591 --> 59:13.375
That's great!
Did you manage to send a card?

59:13.419 --> 59:14.725
Yeah, um...

59:14.768 --> 59:15.813
and I was just curious,

59:15.856 --> 59:16.814
when is she leaving
the hospital?

59:17.815 --> 59:18.816
The first of the year.

59:18.859 --> 59:19.904
Do you think it would be okay

59:19.947 --> 59:22.123
if I dropped by the NICU
before then,

59:22.167 --> 59:24.561
to wish her well in person?

59:24.604 --> 59:26.519
I am sure she would love that.

59:26.563 --> 59:28.565
Great...

59:28.608 --> 59:29.827
and don't mention
anything, okay?

59:29.870 --> 59:31.263
I want it to be a surprise.

59:31.306 --> 59:34.353
Greg, you've given me
a great idea.

59:34.396 --> 59:35.397
I'll text you later.

59:35.441 --> 59:36.224
Great.

59:40.707 --> 59:41.665
[Jenny]: I hope
you and Dad can make it

59:41.708 --> 59:43.188
to the Christmas party.

59:43.231 --> 59:44.450
[Kate]: I thought
you were on a tight budget.

59:44.493 --> 59:46.626
Yeah, well,
I managed to cut some corners,

59:46.670 --> 59:49.368
and I really just want you guys
to meet Alice before she goes.

59:49.411 --> 59:50.499
Okay, sure.

59:50.543 --> 59:51.500
I'll bring
my Christmas cookies.

59:51.544 --> 59:53.111
Yes! My ruse worked.

59:54.765 --> 59:56.636
Under the heading of
"none of my business,"

59:56.680 --> 59:59.639
how was Christmas tree shopping
with your friend, Matt?

59:59.683 --> 01:00:02.250
Um, pretty great, actually.

01:00:02.294 --> 01:00:05.384
We went into the forest,
we got our own tree,

01:00:05.427 --> 01:00:06.951
and then he took me
to this roadside diner,

01:00:06.994 --> 01:00:08.256
where we had
really good hot chocolate.

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:09.431
Are you going to see him again?

01:00:11.129 --> 01:00:13.131
I already did.

01:00:13.174 --> 01:00:14.393
We went ice skating yesterday,

01:00:14.436 --> 01:00:15.176
and we're going to go
for dinner tomorrow.

01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:17.439
Okay, this is major news.

01:00:17.483 --> 01:00:19.659
Mom, we're still just getting
to know each other, okay?

01:00:19.703 --> 01:00:21.400
And enjoying every minute
of it, it seems.

01:00:21.443 --> 01:00:23.184
Yes.

01:00:23.228 --> 01:00:24.490
Yeah, there were bumps at first,

01:00:24.533 --> 01:00:27.667
but... I am really enjoying it.

01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:28.929
What's he like?

01:00:28.973 --> 01:00:29.974
He's funny...

01:00:30.017 --> 01:00:32.672
um, thoughtful...

01:00:32.716 --> 01:00:34.195
he's a really good skater,

01:00:34.239 --> 01:00:37.372
and, as Lauren never tires
of pointing out,

01:00:37.416 --> 01:00:38.809
he's... quite handsome.

01:00:40.941 --> 01:00:42.160
And what about the bumps?

01:00:43.857 --> 01:00:45.424
I think it just took me a while
to figure out who he really is.

01:00:45.467 --> 01:00:47.426
You really like this guy.

01:00:47.469 --> 01:00:48.688
I really do.

01:01:02.049 --> 01:01:03.398
[Jenny]: Hey!

01:01:03.442 --> 01:01:04.661
What are you
doing here?

01:01:04.704 --> 01:01:06.663
I am reporting for duty.

01:01:06.706 --> 01:01:08.577
How are our patients?

01:01:08.621 --> 01:01:10.797
Stable and sleeping,

01:01:10.841 --> 01:01:12.190
and little baby James
is recovering

01:01:12.233 --> 01:01:13.539
as well as any baby
I've ever seen.

01:01:13.582 --> 01:01:14.932
That's wonderful.

01:01:14.975 --> 01:01:17.717
I thought Ashley was doing
the graveyard tonight.

01:01:17.761 --> 01:01:19.371
I gave her the night off.

01:01:19.414 --> 01:01:20.372
Why?

01:01:22.461 --> 01:01:23.810
Because I like
the graveyard shift.

01:01:23.854 --> 01:01:25.943
I always have...

01:01:25.986 --> 01:01:27.901

about the name.

01:01:27.945 --> 01:01:29.381
[chuckles]

01:01:29.424 --> 01:01:31.775
Does seem inappropriate
for a hospital, doesn't it?

01:01:31.818 --> 01:01:33.559
It's just so quiet
this time of night.

01:01:33.602 --> 01:01:36.170
It's peaceful...

01:01:36.214 --> 01:01:38.433
and you can almost forget
that this is a place

01:01:38.477 --> 01:01:40.435
where people
are sick and hurting.

01:01:41.915 --> 01:01:43.743
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

01:01:43.787 --> 01:01:45.223
And this time of year,

01:01:45.266 --> 01:01:48.661
it always reminds me
of that other midnight clear...

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:50.707
and how special Christmas is.

01:01:54.014 --> 01:01:56.364
This Christmas
feels bittersweet.

01:01:58.497 --> 01:01:59.716
Sweet

01:01:59.759 --> 01:02:02.762
because of your new friend
in business affairs?

01:02:02.806 --> 01:02:05.243
And bitter because
of what he was forced to do.

01:02:08.637 --> 01:02:10.378
I don't want to leave, Jen.

01:02:10.422 --> 01:02:12.076
I will admit that,

01:02:12.119 --> 01:02:13.730
and I certainly never imagined
myself leaving.

01:02:14.861 --> 01:02:16.297
No, none of us did.

01:02:16.341 --> 01:02:17.690
It's probably time.

01:02:19.823 --> 01:02:21.781

Christmas cards from angels

01:02:21.825 --> 01:02:22.739

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.089
Oh?

01:02:25.132 --> 01:02:26.699
Yeah.
It's a message, I think.

Life moves on.

01:02:29.615 --> 01:02:31.965

01:02:32.009 --> 01:02:33.314

It's just the natural order.

01:02:35.882 --> 01:02:37.101

By the way,

01:02:39.973 --> 01:02:42.323

for my input yet,

01:02:42.367 --> 01:02:43.629
if they do,

01:02:43.672 --> 01:02:45.718

Of course you are.

You are smart,
and you're dedicated,

01:02:54.858 --> 01:02:56.381
and you're compassionate,

01:02:56.424 --> 01:02:57.556

on your feet,

with people...

01:07:04.063 --> 01:07:04.977
Hi, guys.

01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:06.239
Hi!

01:07:06.283 --> 01:07:08.067
I was just reading
the good news.

01:07:08.111 --> 01:07:09.764
Better than expected
weight gain.

01:07:09.808 --> 01:07:10.983
[Selena]: Starting to breathe
a little on his own.

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:12.028
Well, I'm not
surprised.

01:07:12.071 --> 01:07:12.854
You have a tough
little guy in there.

01:07:14.291 --> 01:07:15.292
He better not be too tough.

01:07:15.335 --> 01:07:17.163
Only in the ways that count.

01:07:17.207 --> 01:07:18.947
Is it too much to hope

01:07:18.991 --> 01:07:20.253
we might have him
home for Christmas?

01:07:20.297 --> 01:07:23.735
Well, hoping isn't a bad thing,

01:07:23.778 --> 01:07:26.085
but I wouldn't count on it.

01:07:26.129 --> 01:07:28.435
But remember,
you're going to have

01:07:28.479 --> 01:07:30.089
a lifetime of Christmases
after this.

01:07:30.133 --> 01:07:32.091
All those precious heartbeats.

01:07:32.135 --> 01:07:33.005
Billions of them.

01:07:35.007 --> 01:07:37.183
Right now,
I just want to hold him...

01:07:37.227 --> 01:07:38.663
really hold him.

01:07:40.099 --> 01:07:41.361
You will.

01:07:41.405 --> 01:07:42.232
Yeah.

01:07:43.668 --> 01:07:45.887
I made tamales
for the party tonight.

01:07:45.931 --> 01:07:47.063
A family tradition.

01:07:47.106 --> 01:07:48.281
Selena!

01:07:48.325 --> 01:07:49.543
I know
you already have a caterer,

01:07:49.587 --> 01:07:51.589
but anything he makes...

01:07:51.632 --> 01:07:52.981
well, it won't be made

01:07:53.025 --> 01:07:54.113
with nearly as much
love and gratitude.

01:07:55.506 --> 01:07:56.681
Thank you.

01:07:56.724 --> 01:07:58.422
They're in the fridge
in the nurses' lounge.

01:07:58.465 --> 01:08:00.206
I already told Walt
to keep away from them

01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:01.381
until tonight.

01:08:01.425 --> 01:08:03.079
Smart move.

01:08:03.122 --> 01:08:04.819
All right, well...

01:08:04.863 --> 01:08:05.690
I'll check in on you later.

01:08:19.573 --> 01:08:20.879
Hi!

01:08:20.921 --> 01:08:22.010
Hi!

01:08:22.054 --> 01:08:22.968
What are you doing
for lunch?

01:08:23.011 --> 01:08:24.622
I am meeting Matt.

01:08:24.665 --> 01:08:25.710
Oh, nice!

01:08:25.752 --> 01:08:27.059
I'm going
to the Snow Flake.

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:28.278
Do you two want
to join me?

01:08:28.321 --> 01:08:30.018
Mm, I'm hungry...

01:08:30.062 --> 01:08:32.108
but you're really
into this skating thing.

01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:33.631
Yeah, and who knows...

01:08:33.674 --> 01:08:35.502
today, I might even
let go of the rail.

01:08:35.546 --> 01:08:37.461
Ooh! Good luck!

01:08:38.897 --> 01:08:40.246
[Matt]: Yeah,
it is Christmas time.

01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:41.813
You're absolutely right,

01:08:41.856 --> 01:08:45.947
and a 5% salary reduction
is a significant hit.

01:08:45.991 --> 01:08:48.167
If there was
another way to do this,

01:08:48.211 --> 01:08:50.778
we would do it,
but there's not.

01:08:50.822 --> 01:08:52.215
I mean,

01:08:52.258 --> 01:08:54.130
sacrifices have to be made
to protect the bottom line.

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:57.481
Okay.
Okay, you, too.

01:08:58.524 --> 01:09:00.919
Hey, Jenny!

01:09:00.962 --> 01:09:01.832
Jenny, I was just going
to come find you.

01:09:01.876 --> 01:09:03.573
Isabel told me
about a...

01:09:04.792 --> 01:09:06.881
I can't go to lunch
with you, Matt.

01:09:06.925 --> 01:09:08.361
Why?

01:09:08.404 --> 01:09:09.622
This just isn't going
to work out.

01:09:09.667 --> 01:09:11.189
-What?
-Us.

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:16.848
Um, yeah, I thought it would,
and I hoped it would, but...

01:09:16.890 --> 01:09:17.892
it's not.

01:09:17.935 --> 01:09:20.372
Jen... I don't understand.

01:09:20.417 --> 01:09:21.983
I just can't do this.

01:09:22.027 --> 01:09:22.984
Okay?

01:09:34.212 --> 01:09:37.651
[♪♪♪]

01:09:43.831 --> 01:09:45.180
[Alice gasps and screams]

01:09:52.362 --> 01:09:53.537
There you are!

01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:54.886
You are not going
to believe what happened.

01:09:54.929 --> 01:09:55.887
Thanks.

01:09:57.236 --> 01:09:58.803
Are you okay?

01:09:58.846 --> 01:10:00.239
I thought you were supposed
to be having lunch with Matt.

01:10:00.283 --> 01:10:01.632
No more lunches with Matt.

01:10:01.675 --> 01:10:02.894
No more anything with Matt.

01:10:02.937 --> 01:10:04.200
Why, what happened?

01:10:05.723 --> 01:10:07.638
I was just wrong about him...

01:10:07.681 --> 01:10:09.292
or rather,
I was so right about him

01:10:09.335 --> 01:10:10.380
in the first place.

01:10:10.423 --> 01:10:12.556
You guys get
in a fight?

01:10:12.599 --> 01:10:13.687
You know what?

01:10:13.731 --> 01:10:15.036
I don't really want
to talk about it.

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:15.994
Actually, I don't even want
to think about it.

01:10:16.037 --> 01:10:17.213
I just...

01:10:17.256 --> 01:10:18.866
I just want
to focus on the party.

01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:21.217
Yeah, see, that's what
you're not going to believe.

01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:22.653
Alice just pulled
a back muscle.

01:10:22.696 --> 01:10:23.828
What?

01:10:23.871 --> 01:10:25.264
Yeah, ice skating.
She just went home.

01:10:25.308 --> 01:10:26.396
That's awful.

01:10:26.439 --> 01:10:28.311
That party we planned
for her tonight?

01:10:28.354 --> 01:10:29.225
She's not going to be there.

01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:38.451
Maybe we should just
postpone the party.

01:10:38.495 --> 01:10:39.583
No, we can't do that.

01:10:39.626 --> 01:10:40.975
There are way too many
moving parts.

01:10:41.019 --> 01:10:41.933
Way too many.

01:10:41.976 --> 01:10:42.890
We've just got
to make sure

01:10:42.934 --> 01:10:43.935
that Alice gets there.

01:10:43.978 --> 01:10:45.284
How are we going
to do that?

01:10:45.328 --> 01:10:46.590
Um, well,

01:10:46.633 --> 01:10:48.418
if I have to throw her
over my shoulder

01:10:48.461 --> 01:10:49.419
and carry her there,

01:10:49.462 --> 01:10:51.551
I will do that.

01:10:51.595 --> 01:10:53.945
See? Taking charge.

01:10:53.988 --> 01:10:55.903
This is why you are going
to make a great supervisor.

01:10:55.947 --> 01:10:58.297
Oh. Did Alice
tell you about that?

01:10:58.341 --> 01:10:59.820
Yeah. I think
it's a great idea,

01:10:59.864 --> 01:11:01.518
and so do
all the other nurses.

01:11:01.561 --> 01:11:03.737
Great.
No pressure.

01:11:03.781 --> 01:11:04.782
I'm sorry about Matt.

01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:07.001
You know what,

01:11:07.045 --> 01:11:08.002
let's just keep
our eyes on the prize.

01:11:08.046 --> 01:11:09.830
This is all
about Alice, okay?

01:11:12.093 --> 01:11:13.225
She didn't give you a reason?

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:14.313
No. Nothing.

01:11:17.098 --> 01:11:19.275
Sounds like maybe
she got cold feet.

01:11:19.318 --> 01:11:20.885
And I flooded her

01:11:20.928 --> 01:11:22.930
with the patented
Crawford charm,

01:11:22.974 --> 01:11:24.497
the full court press.

01:11:24.541 --> 01:11:27.326
I guess
it's better you found out now

01:11:27.370 --> 01:11:29.546
things weren't going
to work out.

01:11:29.589 --> 01:11:31.374
I got her
such a great Christmas present.

01:11:47.041 --> 01:11:48.129
Hi, guys!

01:11:48.173 --> 01:11:49.348
[Dan]: Wow.

01:11:49.392 --> 01:11:51.350
[Selena]:
What a gorgeous dress!

01:11:51.394 --> 01:11:53.265
This old thing?

01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:55.136
Hope you guys have
a great time at the party.

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:56.224
Thank you.

01:11:56.268 --> 01:11:57.487
Obviously,
I'm on my way there,

01:11:57.530 --> 01:11:59.140
but, um...

01:11:59.184 --> 01:11:59.967
I have
one last order of business

01:12:00.011 --> 01:12:00.968
before I clock out.

01:12:01.012 --> 01:12:02.013
This is Ashley.

01:12:02.056 --> 01:12:03.797
She's part
of the excellent crew

01:12:03.841 --> 01:12:05.756
that's going to be
subbing in for us tonight.

01:12:05.799 --> 01:12:08.585
I consulted
with the team today,

01:12:08.628 --> 01:12:11.718
and I spoke
to the head of Pediatrics...

01:12:11.762 --> 01:12:13.198
and we all decided

01:12:13.241 --> 01:12:15.592
that because your little fellow
is doing so well...

01:12:18.203 --> 01:12:20.684
that it might be time
to spend some quality time

01:12:20.727 --> 01:12:22.381
with Mom and Dad.

01:12:46.797 --> 01:12:47.711
Thank you.

01:12:50.583 --> 01:12:52.324
Merry Christmas, guys.

01:13:01.202 --> 01:13:02.508
[knocking]

01:13:05.468 --> 01:13:07.426
Who's that, Dudley?

01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:09.385
Oh, who do you think that is?

01:13:14.259 --> 01:13:15.913
[knocking]

01:13:15.956 --> 01:13:17.175
Uh... oh!

01:13:18.568 --> 01:13:20.134
Wow...

01:13:20.178 --> 01:13:21.658
Oh, you look
beautiful,

01:13:21.701 --> 01:13:23.137
but what are
you doing here?

01:13:23.181 --> 01:13:26.271
Uh-uh.
What are you doing here?

01:13:26.314 --> 01:13:27.054
You should be at the party.

01:13:27.098 --> 01:13:28.186
I know,

01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:29.840
but I just don't want
my back going out

01:13:29.883 --> 01:13:31.407
in the middle
of everybody's fun.

01:13:31.450 --> 01:13:34.235
Standing and walking.
No crutches or cane.

01:13:34.279 --> 01:13:35.323
Noted.

01:13:35.367 --> 01:13:36.803
Okay, you got
10 minutes

01:13:36.847 --> 01:13:37.761
to put your
party dress on...

01:13:37.804 --> 01:13:39.066
Oh, come on, guys...

01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:40.720
Or...

01:13:40.764 --> 01:13:42.983
you are coming to the party
wearing that.

01:13:43.027 --> 01:13:43.941
[Dudley barks]

01:13:45.899 --> 01:13:46.987
Even Dudley's
got my back.

01:13:52.471 --> 01:13:55.866
[♪♪♪]

01:14:04.396 --> 01:14:05.441
She loves Christmas.

01:14:05.484 --> 01:14:06.659
She sure does.

01:14:06.703 --> 01:14:08.095
And look at the
beautiful decorations.

01:14:08.139 --> 01:14:09.445
If I could direct
your attention

01:14:09.488 --> 01:14:10.489
over this way...

01:14:10.533 --> 01:14:11.708
What is th...

01:14:20.194 --> 01:14:21.457
What did you do?

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:22.632
[Walt]: Some personal
decorations here, too.

01:14:25.635 --> 01:14:26.679
Take a look.

01:14:28.202 --> 01:14:30.030
Oh, my...

01:14:30.074 --> 01:14:32.424
Your angels didn't stop
sending you cards.

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:33.338
They just sent them
somewhere else.

01:14:33.381 --> 01:14:34.644
There's so many!

01:14:34.687 --> 01:14:36.689
[Jenny]: Well, we told people
you were leaving,

01:14:36.733 --> 01:14:38.125
and they wanted
to wish you well.

01:14:39.387 --> 01:14:40.476
That's...

01:14:42.478 --> 01:14:43.391
wow.

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:47.613
[Jenny]:
Now, for some people,

01:14:47.657 --> 01:14:50.747
it wasn't quite enough
to send a card,

01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:51.878
so...

01:14:54.402 --> 01:14:55.273
Alice?

01:14:56.579 --> 01:14:59.190
Hi, it's Greg Carter,
Alice.

01:14:59.233 --> 01:15:02.628
I've changed a bit
since you last saw me.

01:15:02.672 --> 01:15:04.500
Gregory Carter!

01:15:04.543 --> 01:15:05.501
Wow...

01:15:06.893 --> 01:15:07.894
My goodness,

01:15:07.938 --> 01:15:10.157
you are all grown up.

01:15:10.201 --> 01:15:10.984
Aw, thank you.

01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:13.421
It's lovely.
How are you?

01:15:13.465 --> 01:15:15.249
How are
your parents?

01:15:15.293 --> 01:15:16.686
I remember...

01:15:16.729 --> 01:15:18.165
it's Rachel
and Mel, right?

01:15:18.209 --> 01:15:19.602
You should ask
them yourself.

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:23.257
Hello!

01:15:23.301 --> 01:15:24.911
Wow, it's been a long time.

01:15:24.955 --> 01:15:27.610
Oh, thank you for...
for coming.

01:15:27.653 --> 01:15:29.220
[tearing up] I'm sorry,
this is just...

01:15:29.263 --> 01:15:30.221
It's a big surprise.

01:15:30.264 --> 01:15:31.265
Happy holidays.

01:15:31.309 --> 01:15:32.397
Thank you.
You too.

01:15:33.833 --> 01:15:34.834
Hi!

01:15:34.878 --> 01:15:36.444
Hey, Zoey.

01:15:36.488 --> 01:15:37.794
She looks great.

01:15:37.837 --> 01:15:39.360
-Thank you.
-Congratulations again.

01:15:39.404 --> 01:15:41.145
Are you sleeping at all?

01:15:41.188 --> 01:15:42.450
No.

01:15:42.494 --> 01:15:44.278
As it should be.

01:15:44.322 --> 01:15:46.019
Thank you for being here.
Merry Christmas.

01:15:46.063 --> 01:15:47.238
Merry Christmas.

01:15:47.281 --> 01:15:48.631
Oh!

01:15:52.809 --> 01:15:54.506
And are you all family?

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:55.638
This is
my baby brother.

01:15:55.681 --> 01:15:56.813
Aw, what a great
coincidence!

01:15:56.856 --> 01:15:58.510
Thank you...

01:15:58.554 --> 01:15:59.598
and look at all
of you!

01:15:59.642 --> 01:16:01.078
Hello!

01:16:01.121 --> 01:16:03.341
How did you all find me here?

01:16:04.951 --> 01:16:07.737
So happy
to see you.

01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:10.566
So happy
to see you all.

01:16:10.609 --> 01:16:12.089
Merry Christmas.

01:16:13.264 --> 01:16:14.918
Hello. Hi.
Oh, I remember you.

01:16:19.531 --> 01:16:21.707
Thank you for being here.

01:16:21.751 --> 01:16:23.056
You did good.

01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:25.145
"We..."

01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:26.886
and we just sent out
the word.

01:16:26.930 --> 01:16:28.627
This is all Alice.

01:16:28.671 --> 01:16:30.368
She spent her whole life
working on this.

01:16:33.806 --> 01:16:35.025
Hi! Merry Christmas.

01:16:35.068 --> 01:16:36.461
I remember you. Hello.

01:16:37.854 --> 01:16:39.595
Oh! My mom and dad.

01:16:39.638 --> 01:16:41.640
It's the best Christmas present.

01:16:41.684 --> 01:16:42.598
Thank you.

01:16:44.469 --> 01:16:45.296
Hi, guys!

01:16:47.124 --> 01:16:49.866
-I'm so glad you came!
-So glad to be here.

01:16:49.909 --> 01:16:51.476
I want you to meet
the star of the show.

01:16:54.479 --> 01:16:55.306
[Jenny laughs]

01:16:56.350 --> 01:16:57.656
One more, okay?

01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:00.354
I just, I want you to meet
my mom and step-dad.

01:17:00.398 --> 01:17:01.704
This is Kate.

01:17:01.747 --> 01:17:03.401
Wonderful to meet you.

01:17:03.444 --> 01:17:04.707
And Bob.

01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:06.360
Jenny's told us
so much about you.

01:17:06.404 --> 01:17:08.014
We feel like
we know you already.

01:17:09.886 --> 01:17:12.062
Actually, have we met?

01:17:13.150 --> 01:17:14.630
No, I don't think so.

01:17:16.588 --> 01:17:18.155
Uh...

01:17:18.198 --> 01:17:19.156
Kate, right?

01:17:19.199 --> 01:17:21.506
Kate...

01:17:21.549 --> 01:17:22.725
Kate Magruder?

01:17:22.768 --> 01:17:25.945
Magruder was my
first husband's name.

01:17:25.989 --> 01:17:28.687
He passed away when
Jenny was very young.

01:17:28.731 --> 01:17:30.820
I'm Kate Miller now.

01:17:33.083 --> 01:17:35.651
You wouldn't remember me
because I was just so young.

01:17:35.694 --> 01:17:38.784
I was, um, just fresh
out of nursing school.

01:17:38.828 --> 01:17:43.267
I was a very small,
very peripheral part

01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:45.225
of the team
that treated your newborn...

01:17:46.923 --> 01:17:48.228
and I remember you

01:17:48.272 --> 01:17:50.013
because your little Mary
was the very first baby

01:17:50.056 --> 01:17:52.363
that I was ever actually
able to help save.

01:17:54.278 --> 01:17:56.715
How is she?
Wow, where is she?

01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:02.547
I never liked the name Mary.

01:18:02.590 --> 01:18:04.288
Um...

01:18:04.331 --> 01:18:07.204
Jennifer's my middle name.

01:18:09.119 --> 01:18:10.033
Oh, my goodness.

01:18:15.865 --> 01:18:17.910
I've always felt like
one of your angels.

01:18:19.869 --> 01:18:20.696
Now I know why.

01:18:25.222 --> 01:18:26.571
Tonight,

01:18:26.614 --> 01:18:27.877
I'm one of your angels.

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:29.705
That is right,

01:18:29.748 --> 01:18:31.750
and we're just
getting started.

01:18:31.794 --> 01:18:33.578
So... you stay,
right here.

01:18:40.411 --> 01:18:42.108
Hi, guys!

01:18:42.152 --> 01:18:44.328
Thank you all so much
for coming.

01:18:44.371 --> 01:18:45.416
[applause]

01:18:51.117 --> 01:18:53.816
We all know why we're here...

01:18:53.859 --> 01:18:57.080
to celebrate Christmas,
of course...

01:18:57.123 --> 01:18:59.517
but just as much

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:03.608
to celebrate the extraordinary
Alice Shelby...

01:19:03.651 --> 01:19:05.262
[applause]

01:19:05.305 --> 01:19:06.089
Come on...

01:19:09.832 --> 01:19:12.269
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:19:12.312 --> 01:19:13.879
Thank you, all.

01:19:13.923 --> 01:19:15.751
Thank you so much.

01:19:17.317 --> 01:19:20.233
And everything that Alice
has done for each one of us.

01:19:20.277 --> 01:19:23.367
We have a little custom,
as most of you know, at the NICU

01:19:23.410 --> 01:19:25.195
on the occasion of departures.

01:19:26.849 --> 01:19:30.026
Our special Alice,
we bid you adieu.

01:19:30.069 --> 01:19:33.029
Go spread your sweet wings
and fly.

01:19:35.248 --> 01:19:38.077
We'd keep you forever,
if only we could...

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:44.257
but now we must hug you
goodbye...

01:19:51.003 --> 01:19:54.398
but though you are leaving,
you won't be forgotten.

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:58.794
We'll never be truly apart.

01:19:58.837 --> 01:20:00.621
You're special, dear Alice...

01:20:02.710 --> 01:20:05.931
we love you so much,

01:20:05.975 --> 01:20:09.369
and each precious beat
of your heart.

01:20:09.413 --> 01:20:11.981
Thank you, Jenny.
Thank you.

01:20:12.024 --> 01:20:13.547
[applause]

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:26.996
May I?

01:20:27.039 --> 01:20:29.085
This?

01:20:30.913 --> 01:20:33.350
If I could have your attention
just for a moment longer,

01:20:33.393 --> 01:20:34.699
everyone, um...

01:20:35.918 --> 01:20:38.007
I'm Matt Crawford.

01:20:38.050 --> 01:20:39.617
You wouldn't be here tonight,

01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:41.358
wishing Alice well
on the next leg of her journey

01:20:41.401 --> 01:20:42.968
if it hadn't been for me.

01:20:43.012 --> 01:20:43.926
Um...

01:20:45.492 --> 01:20:46.972
I'm the guy who let her go.

01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:49.322
I know, I know.

01:20:49.366 --> 01:20:51.281
I did that before I knew Alice,
or the NICU,

01:20:51.324 --> 01:20:53.979
or really anything
about Community Memorial

01:20:54.023 --> 01:20:55.328
and the people who work there.

01:20:55.372 --> 01:20:56.895
They were just...

01:20:56.939 --> 01:20:59.115
well, you were just
numbers to me...

01:20:59.158 --> 01:21:02.379
data...

01:21:02.422 --> 01:21:07.123
but somebody that I have come
to really care about and admire

01:21:07.166 --> 01:21:11.388
reminded me that people
aren't numbers or data.

01:21:11.431 --> 01:21:15.914
So, at the risk of being
the worst party-pooper ever,

01:21:15.958 --> 01:21:18.351
I have to tell you

01:21:18.395 --> 01:21:21.137
that we can't help Alice
celebrate

01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:23.748
the next leg of her journey
tonight...

01:21:23.791 --> 01:21:24.749
sorry...

01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:27.534
because...

01:21:29.058 --> 01:21:30.276
if you want your job back,
you can have it.

01:21:31.974 --> 01:21:33.889
In fact,
everybody I let go can.

01:21:35.412 --> 01:21:36.935
I talked to management.
I made an appeal,

01:21:36.979 --> 01:21:39.155
and the senior staff
at the hospital,

01:21:39.198 --> 01:21:40.896
and almost to a person,
everyone agreed

01:21:40.939 --> 01:21:43.463
on a 5% salary cut
for the upcoming year,

01:21:43.507 --> 01:21:44.987
to keep everybody on

01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:46.858
until I can find
a more hospital-friendly way

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:47.772
to save some money.

01:21:49.295 --> 01:21:50.993
So, Alice...
what do you say?

01:21:51.036 --> 01:21:53.517
Can I give you back your job?

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:54.474
An early Christmas present?

01:21:57.608 --> 01:21:59.088
Yes!

01:21:59.131 --> 01:22:00.785
Yes, you certainly can.

01:22:00.828 --> 01:22:02.439
[enthusiastic applause]

01:22:07.139 --> 01:22:08.619
And what say you?

01:22:08.662 --> 01:22:10.969
Should we shut this shindig down
as no longer necessary,

01:22:11.013 --> 01:22:11.970
or party on?

01:22:12.014 --> 01:22:13.102
Party on!

01:22:13.145 --> 01:22:14.668
That's the spirit.

01:22:14.712 --> 01:22:15.756
Merry Christmas, everybody!

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:16.932
[applause]

01:22:16.975 --> 01:22:18.368
-I'm so sorry.
-Thank you.

01:22:20.761 --> 01:22:21.937
It's a great gift.
Thank you.

01:22:27.812 --> 01:22:29.161
Well, I hope Jenny liked
her Christmas present.

01:22:29.205 --> 01:22:30.119
Uh, you think?

01:22:30.162 --> 01:22:31.207
Yeah.

01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:32.208
[Isabel]: Oh, that's my cue.

01:22:33.992 --> 01:22:34.950
Look, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to--

01:22:42.609 --> 01:22:45.482
Does that mean that
you want to see me again?

01:22:54.752 --> 01:22:56.014
I'll take that
as a "yes."

01:22:56.058 --> 01:22:58.408
Yes.

01:22:58.451 --> 01:23:00.149
This is going to be
the best Christmas ever.

01:23:00.192 --> 01:23:02.020
It already is.

01:23:09.897 --> 01:23:14.902
[♪♪♪]
