00:14.240 --> 00:17.403
You said you liked talking.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.289
I remember that.

00:21.560 --> 00:23.881
"Little chats with a stranger
by the fire."

00:24.080 --> 00:26.208
You said it was like
the movies.

00:28.960 --> 00:32.247
Then you said that you want
everything that I have.

00:35.280 --> 00:37.248
Every last bit.

00:44.760 --> 00:46.364
Well, here it is.

00:48.760 --> 00:51.730
Every last bit.

01:02.120 --> 01:04.646
Morgan:
You don't clear.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.131
You don't.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.928
No.

01:10.080 --> 01:12.401
No, no.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.289
You don't.

01:16.120 --> 01:18.009
You don't.

01:18.160 --> 01:20.481
It doesn't matter
how many days...

01:20.680 --> 01:24.002
or how much time.

01:27.320 --> 01:30.085
We weren't supposed
to be there.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.163
You had the knife.

01:35.360 --> 01:37.806
You had the gun!

01:39.000 --> 01:44.131
You were supposed to.

01:44.280 --> 01:47.966
You know you were
supposed to.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.169
Don't lie.

01:52.840 --> 01:54.410
You know.

01:57.480 --> 02:01.246
You know that
you were supposed to!

07:01.040 --> 07:02.883
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.486
No! I'm sorry.

07:05.640 --> 07:07.165
( Gasping )

07:09.800 --> 07:11.962
You don't.
You don't.

07:12.160 --> 07:15.642
You don't!
You know you don't!

07:15.800 --> 07:18.246

(gurgling stops)

07:52.360 --> 07:54.522
( snarling )

09:16.440 --> 09:18.442
( murmuring )
You're still the same.

09:20.280 --> 09:22.965
You're-- you're still doing it.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.807
You know what it is.

09:30.480 --> 09:34.007
You know what it is.

09:36.760 --> 09:39.240
(grunting )

10:39.560 --> 10:41.210
Man: Can you step away
from the goat?

10:41.360 --> 10:44.011
She's not yours.
And I still need her.

10:44.200 --> 10:46.407
I'm still figuring out
how to make cheese.

10:56.520 --> 10:58.841
Why don't you put the gun down
and we'll talk?

10:59.000 --> 11:02.163
Have some falafel?

11:02.320 --> 11:04.322
Looks like you haven't
eaten for a while.

11:31.240 --> 11:34.449
Really, put down the rifle,
let's talk.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.409
I'm sure we can work this out.

11:45.880 --> 11:48.645
Okay, last chance.

11:48.800 --> 11:52.043
Lower your gun,
step away from the cabin.

12:01.960 --> 12:03.928

12:57.880 --> 12:59.689
What's your name?

13:01.440 --> 13:03.442
Kill me.

13:04.800 --> 13:06.211
Well, that's a stupid name.

13:06.360 --> 13:07.850
It's dangerous.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.525
You should change it.

13:09.720 --> 13:11.802
Kill me.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.166
Kill me!

13:15.320 --> 13:17.368

13:19.160 --> 13:21.049

( Sighs )

13:43.840 --> 13:45.842
Kill me.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.729
My name's Eastman.

- ( walker snarling )

14:44.560 --> 14:47.769
( hammering )

14:47.920 --> 14:50.287
It's yours.

14:50.440 --> 14:53.125
Take it.

14:53.280 --> 14:55.442
It's yours or his.

14:55.600 --> 14:57.409
So you take it.

15:01.280 --> 15:04.762
16 hours
in 19 on the floor.

15:07.920 --> 15:09.763
You know what it is.

15:09.920 --> 15:11.570
( bleats)

15:22.000 --> 15:25.083
You shot at me.
I fed you.

15:25.240 --> 15:26.969
Please don't hurt her.

15:31.280 --> 15:32.691
Good night.

15:32.840 --> 15:37.448

16:17.880 --> 16:21.327
16 hours
in 19 on the floor.

16:58.360 --> 17:01.091
Oh!

17:01.240 --> 17:03.242
Oh, that is--

17:03.400 --> 17:05.402
oh, that's terrible!

17:05.560 --> 17:08.608
That-- oh, God,
that is--

17:08.760 --> 17:10.364
that is terrible.

17:10.520 --> 17:12.204
(gags)

17:24.800 --> 17:27.929
I just wanted to wait a little while
before we talked.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.246
I'm from Atlanta.

17:32.440 --> 17:35.762
I'm a forensic psychiatrist.

17:35.920 --> 17:39.049
The state employed me to determine if
certain people who did very bad things

17:39.240 --> 17:41.766
would do them again
if they were released from prison.

17:43.440 --> 17:45.920
That was my job.
Now I live here,

17:47.560 --> 17:52.407
because of the state of the state
and the whole world.

17:52.560 --> 17:54.847
What did you do
or what do you do now?

17:56.120 --> 17:58.248
I clear.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.289
What the hell does that mean?

18:00.440 --> 18:02.124
Walkers, people,

18:02.280 --> 18:05.124
anything that gets
anywhere near me,

18:05.280 --> 18:09.285
I kill 'em.
I clear.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.962
Why?

18:13.120 --> 18:16.329
Because that's why
I'm still here.

18:18.480 --> 18:20.642
Well...

18:20.800 --> 18:23.167
that's the biggest load
of horseshit I ever heard.

18:33.160 --> 18:34.969
Here's your lunch.

18:56.880 --> 18:59.724
( Tab snaps )

18:59.880 --> 19:02.201
( goat bleats )

19:43.880 --> 19:45.723
It's PTSD.

19:45.880 --> 19:48.451
You've been through
trauma, right?

19:48.600 --> 19:51.251
You see that blood
on the end of my stick?

19:51.400 --> 19:52.925
At the sharp end?

19:53.080 --> 19:55.208
That was two men.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.966
Father and son, maybe.

19:58.120 --> 20:00.521
I stabbed one
through the throat.

20:00.680 --> 20:04.924
He just fell to the ground
with it stuck in him,

20:05.080 --> 20:07.367
trying to breathe
through the blood.

20:09.760 --> 20:13.242
Other one I strangled.
No rope, just my hands.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.968
That was the day
before I came here.

20:17.120 --> 20:19.122
Maybe--

20:19.320 --> 20:20.606
maybe the same day.

20:20.760 --> 20:23.491
L-- I don't know.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.641
But that's what I did.

20:30.920 --> 20:32.604
That's what I do.

20:32.760 --> 20:35.286
You killed a lot of people?

20:35.440 --> 20:36.965
Yes.

20:37.120 --> 20:38.849
They were threatening you,
attacking you?

20:39.000 --> 20:40.843
Not all of them.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.764
You save anyone?

20:44.960 --> 20:47.486
You saved people.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.126
Pointless acts.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.967
Everybody turns.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.849
I saw a wedding ring.

20:58.120 --> 21:00.771
You had someone
you loved, didn't you?

21:02.320 --> 21:04.163
Children?

21:04.360 --> 21:06.362
Oh.

21:06.520 --> 21:09.205
You loved them.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.647
You loved them a lot
if you're like this.

21:15.280 --> 21:16.645
You saw it happen.

21:16.800 --> 21:19.644
That's how this started, right?

21:19.840 --> 21:24.004
It's all happening right in front
of your eyes over and over.

21:24.160 --> 21:25.650
Your body's here,

21:25.840 --> 21:27.968
but your mind is still there.

21:28.120 --> 21:32.444
There's a door and you want to go
through it to get away from it,

21:32.640 --> 21:36.725
so you do and it leads you
right back to that moment.

21:36.880 --> 21:40.566
And you see that door again
and you know it won't work,

21:40.720 --> 21:41.801
but, hell, maybe it'll work.

21:41.960 --> 21:43.325
So you step through that door

21:43.480 --> 21:46.643
and you're right back
in that horrible moment every time.

21:46.800 --> 21:48.370
You still feel it every time.

21:48.520 --> 21:51.251
So you just want to stop
opening that door.

21:51.400 --> 21:54.051
So you just sit in it.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.043
But I assure you,

21:56.200 --> 21:58.043
one of those doors
leads out, my friend.

21:58.200 --> 22:00.521
I don't have any friends.

22:00.680 --> 22:02.091
Get to know me.

22:02.240 --> 22:03.844
Oh, I'm gonna kill you.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.526
- Why?
- Because I have to clear.

22:06.720 --> 22:09.530
See, that's the thing.
You don't.

22:09.720 --> 22:12.326
( Scoffs )
We're not built to kill.

22:12.480 --> 22:15.768
We don't have claws
or fangs or armor.

22:17.360 --> 22:21.046
Vets that came back
with PTSD,

22:21.200 --> 22:23.567
that didn't happen
because we're comfortable with killing.

22:23.720 --> 22:26.007
We're not.
We can't be.

22:26.160 --> 22:28.049
We feel.
We're connected.

22:28.240 --> 22:31.767
You know, I've interviewed
over 825 people

22:31.920 --> 22:35.686
who've done terrible things.
I've only met one evil person.

22:35.840 --> 22:38.411
Some of them were born
with bad brains.

22:38.560 --> 22:40.608
Some of them got sick
along the way.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.569
The rest were
just damaged people,

22:42.720 --> 22:45.371
traumatized themselves, like you,
but they could heal.

22:45.520 --> 22:47.761
Some more, some less,
but they can.

22:47.920 --> 22:49.763
We all can.

22:51.560 --> 22:53.403
I know it.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.926
It's all a circle
and everything gets a return.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.168
The door is open.

23:05.640 --> 23:07.927
That door right there.
The cell door, it's open.

23:08.080 --> 23:10.242
I threw the key
in the river a while back.

23:10.400 --> 23:12.323
I'm not gonna hold you anymore.

23:12.480 --> 23:16.326
I can't stop you.
Go, clear.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.608
Or stay,
crash on the couch,

23:18.760 --> 23:21.650
and we'll try
to find you another way.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.802
The door's open.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.764
It's been open all along.

23:30.120 --> 23:33.090
You stay or you go.

23:33.240 --> 23:35.083
Those are the choices.

23:35.240 --> 23:38.449
I will not allow you to kill me.

23:38.640 --> 23:40.642
I will not allow that.

24:05.640 --> 24:06.641
Eastman:
Don't!

24:09.840 --> 24:11.330
Stop.

24:11.480 --> 24:13.482
(growling )

24:13.680 --> 24:15.489
( groans )

24:15.680 --> 24:17.682
- Stop.
- ( Morgan growling )

24:23.840 --> 24:25.968
I gave you two choices.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.968
Oh, shit.

24:33.120 --> 24:35.202
( Groans )

24:35.360 --> 24:38.011
(grunting )

24:41.160 --> 24:42.889
( choking )

25:00.200 --> 25:02.601
( gasping )

25:29.400 --> 25:31.528
Kill me.

25:41.640 --> 25:44.246
I gave you two choices.

25:44.400 --> 25:46.801
The door or the couch.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.122
( Hammering )

26:51.160 --> 26:53.640
That was aikido.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.842
That's how I kicked
your ass earlier.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.606
Well, that's how
I redirected your ass.

27:01.840 --> 27:05.845
The people in prison
I evaluated for the state,

27:06.000 --> 27:08.571
the stories I heard,

27:08.720 --> 27:11.724
the things these people did...

27:11.880 --> 27:13.882
One night,
my five-year-old daughter

27:14.040 --> 27:18.807
found me crying in the garage
after about eight beers.

27:18.960 --> 27:20.849
Told her I wasn't feeling too good.

27:23.680 --> 27:25.409
She gave me this.

27:29.360 --> 27:33.729
She had won it at a carnival
at school that day.

27:33.920 --> 27:37.527
She said it'd make me lucky
and I'd feel better.

27:37.680 --> 27:40.729
The next morning I found
a flyer for aikido.

27:42.840 --> 27:44.763
Damn thing worked.

27:46.520 --> 27:48.568
Your wife
and your daughter...

27:50.320 --> 27:52.448
they're dead?

28:01.440 --> 28:04.046
It was aikido.

28:04.240 --> 28:05.765
<i>It'll</i> help.

28:07.080 --> 28:12.086
And you obviously need help
if we're gonna make this trip.

28:12.240 --> 28:13.765
Can't just be
me and you to the end.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.406
You're a shit conversationalist.

28:16.560 --> 28:20.042
And I can't make
this trip by myself.

28:20.200 --> 28:21.964
A trip where?

28:27.640 --> 28:29.404
I have no idea.

28:36.440 --> 28:38.090
Good night.

28:44.960 --> 28:47.440
( Door closes )

28:47.600 --> 28:49.170

29:29.160 --> 29:31.208

29:38.800 --> 29:41.201
Grassy notes are a little
too Astroturf,

29:41.360 --> 29:43.203
but there's potential here.

29:43.360 --> 29:45.806
There is always potential.

29:45.960 --> 29:48.008
Where there's life,
there's potential.

29:49.640 --> 29:51.688
I've been a vegetarian
for a while now.

29:51.840 --> 29:55.526
I was afraid that damn goat
was gonna make me a vegan.

29:55.680 --> 29:59.002
I don't kill, but I'm not giving up
on chocolate any time soon.

30:03.720 --> 30:06.963
You might notice I'm not giving up
on the Goo Goo Clusters.

30:07.120 --> 30:08.360
They're gonna
remain on the menu.

30:08.520 --> 30:11.683
You should try one.
They're good.

30:11.840 --> 30:13.888
Come on, you're alive.
Live a little.

30:15.320 --> 30:16.560
We should go out.

30:16.720 --> 30:20.566
We got a lot here, but we should
scavenge some things up for the trip.

30:20.720 --> 30:22.210
You coming?

30:24.080 --> 30:26.367
Will you watch Tabitha
while I'm gone?

30:28.480 --> 30:30.209
Can you do that for me?

30:35.720 --> 30:37.404
( Sighs )

30:40.040 --> 30:42.361
( door opens )

30:46.040 --> 30:49.362
- ( goat bleats )
- ( door closes )

31:43.560 --> 31:45.722
( distant cans rattling )

31:54.960 --> 31:56.962
( walkers snarling )

31:57.120 --> 31:59.282
( goat bleating )

32:05.280 --> 32:08.489
- ( goat screaming )
- ( walkers snarling )

32:13.680 --> 32:16.286
- ( walkers snarling )
- ( goat screaming )

32:33.320 --> 32:35.322
( breathing echoes )

32:40.160 --> 32:43.323
( goat bleating )

32:46.160 --> 32:48.288
( roaring )

32:54.400 --> 32:56.050
(grunts)

33:02.080 --> 33:03.366
( wings flutter)

33:03.520 --> 33:06.091
( birds cawing, chirping )

34:51.920 --> 34:53.842
Well, you maimed
a tomato plant,

34:54.000 --> 34:57.129
but it looks to me like you saved
a goat today, my friend.

34:59.320 --> 35:01.800
<i>He'! '</i>

35:01.960 --> 35:04.167
Thank you.

35:07.160 --> 35:09.003
Progress.

35:18.800 --> 35:20.689
Just a second.

36:03.920 --> 36:07.561
( Sighs )
A and B.

36:07.720 --> 36:10.041
A-- you broke
the garden fence,

36:10.200 --> 36:12.009
laid waste to a perfectly good
tomato plant.

36:12.160 --> 36:13.571
You got to fix it.

36:13.720 --> 36:16.849
B-- follow me.

36:28.120 --> 36:30.088
Fixed your spear.

37:21.960 --> 37:24.566
Eastman:
It's about redirecting.

37:26.960 --> 37:28.121
Morgan:
Evading.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.760
(grunting )

37:30.920 --> 37:35.084
Eastman: And actually caring
about the welfare of your opponent.

37:37.280 --> 37:39.806
Morgan: So you have to care
about yourself.

37:41.840 --> 37:44.286
Eastman: You have to believe
your life is precious,

37:44.440 --> 37:47.842
that all life is precious.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.765
Morgan: You have to redirect
those thoughts,

37:50.920 --> 37:53.321
the history
that tells you otherwise.

37:55.160 --> 37:58.209
Eastman: What we've done,
we've done.

38:05.840 --> 38:08.320
Morgan: We evade it
by moving forward

38:08.480 --> 38:10.847
with a code
to never to do it again.

38:13.840 --> 38:16.002
Eastman:
To make up for it.

38:22.360 --> 38:25.011
Morgan: To still accept
what we were.

38:32.520 --> 38:33.806
<i>He'! '</i>

38:49.480 --> 38:51.926
Eastman:
To accept everyone.

38:52.080 --> 38:55.243
Morgan:
To protect everyone.

38:55.400 --> 38:59.041
Eastman: And in doing that,
protect yourself.

39:01.200 --> 39:03.771
Morgan:
To create peace.

39:14.880 --> 39:17.531
Why do you have a cell
in your cabin?

39:23.360 --> 39:26.603
Built this place
with my wife

39:26.800 --> 39:29.246
a while before
our daughter was born.

39:29.400 --> 39:31.084
It didn't have
a cell back then.

39:31.240 --> 39:33.242
That was just the other side
of the living room.

39:34.960 --> 39:38.248
In my job I interviewed
over 800 men and 25 women

39:38.400 --> 39:40.607
convicted of awful things,

39:40.760 --> 39:44.970
stuff from the darkest part
of the human soul.

39:45.120 --> 39:49.728
I was evaluating a man by the name
of Crighton Dallas Wilton.

39:49.880 --> 39:51.405
( Chuckles )

39:51.560 --> 39:54.245
Name like that, sounded like he should
own an oil company

39:54.400 --> 39:56.926
and wear a big hat--
Crighton Dallas Wilton.

39:59.440 --> 40:02.603
Despite doing some truly unspeakable
acts, he was up for parole.

40:02.760 --> 40:06.924
And he was one of the most damn likable
people I had ever met.

40:07.080 --> 40:09.481
He said all the right things,
he went to therapy.

40:09.640 --> 40:12.849
He wrote letters to the prison board
to start a program

40:13.000 --> 40:17.483
to grow flowers for the waiting rooms
in state hospitals, rest homes.

40:17.680 --> 40:22.481
And I saw
right through him.

40:22.640 --> 40:24.483
Saw that he was
a true psychopath,

40:24.640 --> 40:27.610
that he knew how to play people,
exactly how to play people.

40:27.760 --> 40:30.809
I was interviewing him
next to the cafeteria.

40:30.960 --> 40:32.849
The place smelled
of industrial pizza.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.331
They were polishing
the floor.

40:34.480 --> 40:38.371
I had to shout my questions
half the time.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.204
And there was this moment.

40:42.520 --> 40:44.807
Can't even remember
the exchange.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.686
But right then I knew
that Crighton knew

40:48.880 --> 40:51.531
that I knew exactly what he was.

40:51.680 --> 40:54.001
Everything he had said, done

40:54.160 --> 40:58.131
to hide away what he was
from everyone, from himself,

40:58.280 --> 41:00.487
just slipped away, and...

41:02.160 --> 41:04.288
...and that model prisoner
of 10 years stood up,

41:04.480 --> 41:06.562
smiled,

41:06.720 --> 41:08.882
and just cracked me
across the face.

41:11.360 --> 41:13.522
His fist felt like a rock.

41:13.680 --> 41:17.002
Then he was on top of me
and the floor polisher next door

41:17.200 --> 41:18.850
was thudding out
every sound.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.331
And I--

41:20.480 --> 41:24.530
and I saw his face,

41:24.680 --> 41:28.526
his-- his eyes,

41:28.680 --> 41:30.364
his evil.

41:32.160 --> 41:34.731
Mask had slipped.

41:34.880 --> 41:38.362
And he was gonna kill me
right then and there

41:38.520 --> 41:41.729
because he knew I would make sure
he would never get out again.

41:56.600 --> 41:59.046
Arm bar counter

41:59.240 --> 42:03.290
for being choked
from a pinned position.

42:03.440 --> 42:05.249
Aikido.

42:06.880 --> 42:12.284
I wasn't taking it for self-defense,
but it saved my life.

42:12.440 --> 42:14.761
And I got to make sure
he never got out again.

42:17.040 --> 42:20.283
Well, got to try.

42:20.440 --> 42:22.602
He got out.

42:22.760 --> 42:24.922
Talked to the right people
who got him the right things

42:25.080 --> 42:27.242
and he broke out,
but it wasn't to escape.

42:30.760 --> 42:32.922
Crighton Dallas Wilton
went to my home

42:33.080 --> 42:36.607
and killed my wife,
my daughter, and my son.

42:38.600 --> 42:42.286
He walked down the street
to the police station around the corner,

42:42.440 --> 42:45.171
covered in their blood.

42:45.320 --> 42:47.448
He surrendered.

42:47.600 --> 42:51.127
Said the only reason
he broke out

42:51.280 --> 42:53.248
was to destroy my life.

42:59.440 --> 43:01.329
A year passed...

43:03.080 --> 43:05.970
...and he was still working
those plots.

43:06.120 --> 43:11.331
They just let him work those plots
by the roads out by 85,

43:11.520 --> 43:14.649
grow chrysanthemums,
forget-me-nots.

43:19.960 --> 43:22.486
I built that cell
with the full intention

43:22.640 --> 43:26.167
of bringing
Crighton Dallas Wilton here,

43:26.320 --> 43:29.642
putting him behind those bars
and watching him starve to death.

43:36.600 --> 43:38.443
And did you?

43:42.000 --> 43:45.004
I have come to believe

43:45.160 --> 43:47.845
that all life is precious.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.048
Even for a man like that?

43:50.200 --> 43:52.362
Who did that to you?

43:53.680 --> 43:55.523
To your family?

43:57.680 --> 44:00.331
I have come to believe

44:00.480 --> 44:04.530
that all life
is precious.

44:10.200 --> 44:13.044
That's why we're having
oatmeal burgers.

44:21.520 --> 44:23.363
You're good at it.

44:27.080 --> 44:28.730
Redirecting.

44:41.240 --> 44:43.561
We need more gear.

44:43.720 --> 44:45.370
Tarp, crowbar.

44:45.520 --> 44:48.285
I'm thinking we could try
for the islands off the coast.

44:48.440 --> 44:50.249
I think people
could have gone there.

44:50.400 --> 44:52.880
Hell, at the very least,
we could see the beach.

44:56.280 --> 44:58.123
What is it?

45:00.240 --> 45:02.561
I know where we can find all that.

45:46.440 --> 45:48.568
Who did you lose?

45:53.400 --> 45:55.289
My wife and son.

45:58.800 --> 46:00.689
Who you lost.

46:00.840 --> 46:02.444
Their names.

46:11.320 --> 46:14.483
Jenny and Duane.

46:17.800 --> 46:19.484
I'm sorry.

46:23.120 --> 46:25.327
Don't ever be sorry.

46:31.880 --> 46:33.041
Forms, right now.

46:33.200 --> 46:34.645
Not here.

46:34.800 --> 46:37.167
Right now.

46:53.960 --> 46:55.325
(grunts)

47:03.200 --> 47:05.521
( breathing heavily )

47:17.720 --> 47:19.404
(grunts)

47:27.920 --> 47:30.048
You're gonna hold
a baby again.

47:37.120 --> 47:38.770
(grunts)

47:45.920 --> 47:48.571
(walker snarling )

47:48.760 --> 47:51.730
( snarling )

47:51.880 --> 47:53.928
It's all yours.

48:21.760 --> 48:23.444
Damn it, move!

48:23.600 --> 48:25.443
Ow!

48:37.640 --> 48:40.928
I said not here.

48:41.080 --> 48:42.844
That wasn't for you to do.

48:43.000 --> 48:46.004
How could you do that?
That wasn't for you to do!

48:47.960 --> 48:49.803
You can't just--

48:49.960 --> 48:51.644
you can't just step in!

48:53.080 --> 48:54.809
Tell me how it is.

48:54.960 --> 48:58.123
Tell me how it is!
Tell me!

49:01.360 --> 49:02.486
Let's go home.

49:02.640 --> 49:05.644
I'm not going anywhere.

49:05.800 --> 49:08.644
You're coming back.

49:08.840 --> 49:10.842
You are done with this.

49:12.800 --> 49:17.328
You made it out.

49:27.960 --> 49:29.007
Ow!

49:29.160 --> 49:31.208
( Roaring )

49:33.800 --> 49:35.848
(grunting )

49:41.560 --> 49:43.403
Kill me.

49:44.880 --> 49:46.689
Kill me!

50:08.560 --> 50:10.403
(grunts)

50:18.360 --> 50:21.887
I said not here.

50:22.080 --> 50:25.562
Well, that's the thing, Morgan.

50:28.400 --> 50:30.289
Here's not here.

50:30.440 --> 50:32.920
( Panting )

51:06.640 --> 51:09.325
(walker snarling )

51:27.600 --> 51:29.489
( squelches )

51:38.760 --> 51:39.761
( growls )

51:39.920 --> 51:42.321
(whimpers )
No.

52:09.680 --> 52:11.170
Thank you.

52:40.400 --> 52:42.528
(walker snarling )

53:10.680 --> 53:12.887
( panting )

53:17.960 --> 53:20.691
Oh, she got out.

53:20.880 --> 53:24.930
( Sighs ) She figured out
the door was open, too.

53:25.080 --> 53:27.560
I didn't figure it out.

53:27.760 --> 53:29.888
You had to tell me.

53:32.600 --> 53:34.364
Glad you're back.

53:34.560 --> 53:35.891
Here.

53:37.760 --> 53:39.808
Come on, you sit down
before you fall down.

54:27.800 --> 54:29.802
Eastman:
Well, like I said, they...

54:31.000 --> 54:33.970
let him work
the plots beside 85.

54:35.480 --> 54:37.608
Even after what he did.

54:37.760 --> 54:41.162
They let him because
he was so damn charming.

54:41.320 --> 54:43.800
I found out
the schedule, waited,

54:43.960 --> 54:46.531
made sure the right people
were working.

54:48.360 --> 54:53.161
I got him in my car quick
and brought him back here.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.321
If they'd have caught me,
it'd have been fine.

55:01.280 --> 55:03.123
It'd have been better.

55:06.160 --> 55:11.041
But I got him here
and they didn't know where to look.

55:11.240 --> 55:12.480
( Exhales )

55:12.640 --> 55:15.041
You gotta sit down.

55:15.200 --> 55:17.567
All right.
(winces )

55:17.720 --> 55:19.324
I'm okay.

55:25.080 --> 55:27.048
( Exhales )

55:29.880 --> 55:32.360
I put him in that cell...

55:33.720 --> 55:35.927
...and I let him starve to death.

55:38.160 --> 55:40.606
It took 47 days.

55:43.880 --> 55:48.568
And then I was gone.

55:48.720 --> 55:51.200
I was where you were.

55:51.360 --> 55:54.682
And I wasn't trying to open up
the door anymore either.

55:56.520 --> 55:59.729
What I did to him,

55:59.880 --> 56:02.042
it didn't give me any peace.

56:03.400 --> 56:05.971
I found my peace

56:06.120 --> 56:09.522
when I decided
to never kill again.

56:12.080 --> 56:14.811
To never kill
anything again.

56:17.400 --> 56:18.970
When I decided
to settle things,

56:19.120 --> 56:22.442
I went back to Atlanta
to turn myself in.

56:22.600 --> 56:25.251
That's how I found out
the world ended.

56:28.320 --> 56:30.641
But the world hasn't ended.

56:35.720 --> 56:37.563
Progress.

56:47.440 --> 56:50.444
My daughter drew this
on the hallway wall of our house.

56:50.600 --> 56:52.602
She thought I'd get mad.

56:52.800 --> 56:54.802
I just put a frame around it.

56:57.960 --> 57:01.282
After I went back, when I found out
I couldn't turn myself in

57:01.440 --> 57:04.250
because there was no one
to turn myself in to,

57:04.440 --> 57:07.649
I went back home
to cut this from the wall.

57:07.800 --> 57:10.644
I lost the car on the way back.

57:10.800 --> 57:15.840
I walked through 30 miles of the dead
for a piece of drywall.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.844
( laughs )

57:19.000 --> 57:21.321
Scariest thing I ever did.

57:23.320 --> 57:25.482
Best thing I ever did.

57:27.520 --> 57:29.648
( Sighs )

57:29.840 --> 57:31.683
You can stay here.

57:31.880 --> 57:35.327
You have enough food,
power, security.

57:35.480 --> 57:37.687
For the rest of your life,
you could stay here.

57:37.840 --> 57:40.810
But you shouldn't stay here.

57:40.960 --> 57:44.851
Can't expect such a splendid guest
as yourself to show up.

57:46.120 --> 57:48.122
You stay here,
you'll be alone.

57:49.680 --> 57:52.160
You were alone.

57:52.360 --> 57:54.806
Everything is about people.

57:56.400 --> 57:59.483
Everything in this life
that's worth a damn.

57:59.640 --> 58:02.484
It couldn't be just me.
It shouldn't be just you.

58:04.680 --> 58:07.843
Hell, Tabitha's gone now.

58:11.680 --> 58:14.047
( Sighs )
I'm ready.

58:15.720 --> 58:18.041
I have a gun in
the lockbox out there.

58:22.360 --> 58:23.885
Here.

58:28.040 --> 58:30.407
( labored breathing )

58:30.560 --> 58:32.449
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

58:41.880 --> 58:44.360
Hope it's lucky for you, too,

58:44.520 --> 58:46.602
whatever you decide.

58:48.440 --> 58:50.442
I've decided.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.208
And that's it.

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.762
Every last bit.

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:30.410
You think it can work out
that way with me?

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:33.370
Yes.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.090
I think it can.

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:39.241
( Chuckles )

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:41.562
Maybe.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:45.042
You noticed
I'm shaking a little?

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:48.927
Sweating a little?

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:56.366
Oh, man.

01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:58.767
( Sighs )

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:03.130
I saw how settled this place was
in the pictures I found.

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:09.723
I thought maybe there'd be
something here.

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:13.168
Medicine to help this.

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:18.930
But that was before
you people won.

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:26.282
So I know I'm probably
going to die.

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:28.488
But if I don't...

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:33.609
...I am going to have
to kill you, Morgan.

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:38.322
I'm going to have to kill
every person here.

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:41.967
Every one of them.
The children, too.

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:46.364
Just like your friend
Eastman's children.

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:50.805
Those are the rules.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:53.167
That's my code.

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:55.288
I'd say I'm sorry,

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.011
but you said it, right?

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.688
Don't ever be sorry.

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:38.207
(keys jingle)

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:44.686
( lock clicks )

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:58.330
Rick:
Open the gate!

01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:00.363
OPen the gate!

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:07.203
( Theme music playing )
