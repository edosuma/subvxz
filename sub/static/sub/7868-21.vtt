Hello, darkness.

00:20.566 --> 00:21.833
Morning!

00:45.758 --> 00:47.125

01:05.844 --> 01:08.913
ha! Ha!

01:14.921 --> 01:16.955
<i>Springfield, U.S.A.</i>

01:17.023 --> 01:19.091
<i>A town where everyone's
got a story.</i>

01:19.159 --> 01:20.893
<i>I moved here
'cause on a calculator,</i>

01:20.960 --> 01:22.661
<i>The zip code spells "boobs."</i>

01:22.729 --> 01:24.830
<i>It's a town filled with winners</i>

01:24.898 --> 01:26.231
<i>And skinners.</i>

01:26.299 --> 01:27.800
Why couldn't you have died

01:27.867 --> 01:29.501
Instead of the car?

01:29.569 --> 01:33.172
<i>But everybody comes to Moe's.</i>

01:52.058 --> 01:55.961
<i>Moe's tavern,
presided over by Moe Szyslak--</i>

01:56.029 --> 01:58.697
<i>Handsome, suave, debonair.</i>

02:00.233 --> 02:02.034
Hey, get the camera off of me.

02:02.101 --> 02:03.702
I'm narrating here.

02:03.770 --> 02:06.104
<i>Anyway, here's my little tale.</i>

02:06.172 --> 02:09.541
<i>As the town's bartender,
I know everyone's problems.</i>

02:09.609 --> 02:15.047
<i>And everyone's got problems,
especially the married ones.</i>

02:15.114 --> 02:16.748
<i>Be they bible-thumper...</i>

02:16.816 --> 02:19.618
Timothy, I finished
saying my prayers.

02:19.686 --> 02:21.220
Not now, Helen.

02:21.287 --> 02:22.788
Today's the day
I paint moustaches

02:22.856 --> 02:24.089
On my Pullman porters.

02:25.758 --> 02:27.526
Mmm...

02:27.594 --> 02:29.027
<i>...Or jerky jockey.</i>

02:29.095 --> 02:31.096
* go to sleep, sleepy head *

02:31.164 --> 02:33.065
* may a cloud be your... *

02:33.132 --> 02:34.633
Where did we get this dreck?

02:34.701 --> 02:36.802
Oof. Typical.

02:36.870 --> 02:40.706
Here's the kind of lullaby
my sweet mother sang to me.

02:43.576 --> 02:45.344
Oh!

02:45.411 --> 02:49.548
Why do you always change it
The dot?

02:49.616 --> 02:52.551
I like rajiv, rubaba
and big brahmin in the morning!

02:52.619 --> 02:55.687
No caste is safe
from their merry japes!

02:55.755 --> 02:59.157
Having a ma-hot-ma or man-not-ma
contest is not a jape.

02:59.225 --> 03:00.893
It is sexist sacrilege!

03:00.960 --> 03:02.327
I hate that channel!

03:02.395 --> 03:04.663
But you have so much
in common with them--

03:04.731 --> 03:06.031
Nonstop chatter
during drive time!

03:06.099 --> 03:07.466
Take it back.

03:07.534 --> 03:09.368
I take it back.

03:09.435 --> 03:11.203
<i>And now
you're probably wondering,</i>

03:11.271 --> 03:13.372
<i>What's this all building to?</i>

03:13.439 --> 03:14.940
<i>It's a timeless tale of...</i>

03:15.008 --> 03:16.875
<i>Hello!</i>

03:16.943 --> 03:19.177
<i>Are you seein'
what I'm seein' here? Ooh!</i>

03:19.245 --> 03:20.913
<i>This omniscient point of view</i>

03:20.980 --> 03:22.681
<i>Has got
some surprising bonuses!</i>

03:22.749 --> 03:23.982
<i>Yeah.</i>

03:24.050 --> 03:26.585
<i>Aw. No! No! No! Oh!</i>

03:26.653 --> 03:28.353
<i>What the hell
was I talking about?</i>

03:28.421 --> 03:30.088
<i>Oh, yeah. It was just
before mother's day.</i>

03:30.156 --> 03:34.426
I destroyed my body
to give birth to you?!

03:37.430 --> 03:40.365
Kids, this mother's day,

03:40.433 --> 03:42.935
Why don't you give your mom

03:43.002 --> 03:44.836
A break from you?

03:44.904 --> 03:47.139
Have your dads
take all you annoying kids

03:47.206 --> 03:49.908
On a krusty krustival kruiseline
day-kruise

03:49.976 --> 03:51.877
To historic weasel island,

03:51.945 --> 03:54.479
One of America's
ten roundest islands.

03:54.547 --> 03:58.150
Explore a dark,
dark weasel cave.

03:58.217 --> 04:00.018
<i>Tour the historic
civil war prison,</i>

04:00.086 --> 04:01.787
<i>And picnic where the bodies</i>

04:01.854 --> 04:03.855
<i>Were once stacked
like cordwood.</i>

04:03.923 --> 04:05.824
<i>Plus some kind
of amusement park!</i>

04:05.892 --> 04:07.726
<i>You may not be amused.</i>

04:07.794 --> 04:09.328
You guys should
go on that cruise.

04:09.395 --> 04:11.096
You'll have a great time,

04:11.164 --> 04:13.865
And you kids can spend the day
getting to know your father.

04:13.933 --> 04:17.502
I like beer, hot dogs, and
long blackouts on the beach.

04:17.570 --> 04:20.572
And I can spend my mother's day
taking care of something

04:20.640 --> 04:22.975
I've been putting off
for a long time.

04:23.042 --> 04:24.910
Cleaning the gutters?

04:24.978 --> 04:26.678
That's something
you've been putting off.

04:26.746 --> 04:28.947
Cartoons! Everybody, be quiet!

05:01.180 --> 05:04.616
* *

05:10.723 --> 05:12.424
So, Marge,
what were we talking about?

05:14.027 --> 05:15.427
Why do I waste my breath?

05:15.495 --> 05:16.995
Sorry, honey.
I wasn't listening,

05:17.063 --> 05:18.630
And I won't be listening now.

05:21.634 --> 05:23.902
Hey, Homer,
what do you think mom meant by

05:23.970 --> 05:25.671
"taking care of something"?

05:25.738 --> 05:28.473
Son, I'm a bit of an expert
on the female gender,

05:28.541 --> 05:32.711
And I can tell you, women don't
mean anything by anything.

05:32.779 --> 05:34.479
Dad, that's a dangerous attitude

05:34.547 --> 05:36.314
For you to take
towards your wife.

05:36.382 --> 05:38.150
I hear what you're saying, Lisa.

05:38.217 --> 05:39.584
Nothing.

05:42.822 --> 05:44.423
Into the playpen, sweetie.

05:44.490 --> 05:46.725
And if you get hungry,
there's lobster.

05:55.635 --> 05:57.269
Special delivery letter

05:57.336 --> 05:59.805
For misters Simpson, Lovejoy
and Nahasapeemapetilon.

06:02.408 --> 06:04.076
It's going to drop.

06:07.580 --> 06:09.114
What?

06:13.953 --> 06:15.754
It's from Moe.

06:15.822 --> 06:18.457
<i>"dear friends, I have
some news that is doubly sad.</i>

06:18.524 --> 06:20.792
<i>"first off,
I am leaving town forever.</i>

06:20.860 --> 06:23.261
<i>"and my going away present?</i>

06:23.329 --> 06:25.530
<i>One of your wives
is running off with me."</i>

06:25.598 --> 06:27.733
One of our wives is
leaving us for Moe?!

06:27.800 --> 06:29.868
Moe's leaving town?!

06:29.936 --> 06:31.937
<i>"perhaps I should've
told you in person,</i>

06:32.004 --> 06:34.539
<i>"but there's no easy way
to say good-bye forever.</i>

06:34.607 --> 06:37.008
<i>"so I'll say it the hardest way
In mandarin Chinese.</i>

06:37.076 --> 06:38.410
<i>Zai jian Yong yuan!"</i>

06:40.546 --> 06:42.280
<i>And now, as our
teakettle starts to toot,</i>

06:42.348 --> 06:44.316
<i>I'm gonna take a little break.</i>

06:44.383 --> 06:46.318
<i>Boy, this
voice-over thing is killin' me.</i>

06:46.385 --> 06:49.488
<i>Whatever that don Pardo
gets paid, it ain't enough.</i>

06:49.555 --> 06:51.656
<i>I make more than
you can possibly imagine.</i>

06:51.724 --> 06:53.725
<i>And I'm making it right now.</i>

06:53.793 --> 06:54.793
<i>Where are you?</i>

06:57.124 --> 07:00.460
Moe is running off
with one of our wives?!

07:00.528 --> 07:02.095
Well, the stationery's legit.

07:02.163 --> 07:04.331
It's got the Moe watermark.

07:04.398 --> 07:06.166
So I guess the question is,

07:06.234 --> 07:09.002
Which one of our wives
got Moe-jacked?

07:09.070 --> 07:10.804
Well, I will end this suspense

07:10.872 --> 07:13.440
With a simple cellular
phone call to Manjula.

07:15.243 --> 07:17.410
No signal?!
No battery?!

07:17.478 --> 07:19.179
I got Marge!
Homer?

07:19.247 --> 07:20.814
Marge, are you running off
with Moe?

07:20.882 --> 07:22.849
Homer? I'm... You!

07:22.917 --> 07:25.252
You're losing me,
or you're leaving me?!

07:25.319 --> 07:26.887
We're breaking up!

07:26.954 --> 07:28.955
Aw, damn it!

07:30.358 --> 07:31.558
Homer?

07:31.626 --> 07:33.460
Ooh, can't talk.
Must text.

07:33.527 --> 07:38.331
Marge, have you left me for...?

07:40.701 --> 07:43.069
We needed that pole
to hook the dock.

07:47.408 --> 07:49.342
Most of our cargo
is explosives.

07:58.185 --> 07:59.986
You rebel scum make me sick.

08:00.054 --> 08:01.855
This is sweet justice

08:01.923 --> 08:04.324
For how you greybacks treated
our boys at Andersonville!

08:06.394 --> 08:09.529
When there's cruelty involved,
Bart sure knows his history.

08:09.597 --> 08:12.165
Well, if Moe were leaving
with one of our wives,

08:12.233 --> 08:13.833
It wouldn't be my Helen.

08:13.901 --> 08:16.369
We just started
a new jigsaw puzzle last week.

08:16.437 --> 08:18.038
We're still on the edges.

08:18.105 --> 08:20.874
Well, Marge and I don't have
any problems.

08:20.942 --> 08:22.776
We never even fight anymore.

08:22.843 --> 08:25.111
What?

08:25.179 --> 08:27.047
When a woman is peaceful
and content,

08:27.114 --> 08:29.549
That means all hell is about
to break loose.

08:29.617 --> 08:31.251
Think back, Homer.

08:31.319 --> 08:33.520
When did you first realize
Marge was checked out

08:33.587 --> 08:35.956
<i>Like a Harry Potter book
at the public library?</i>

08:36.023 --> 08:37.557
Think back,

08:37.625 --> 08:39.458
Think back, think back...

08:42.063 --> 08:44.297
Not that far back.

08:46.300 --> 08:49.402
Homer, my mother's party's
starting any minute. Get busy.

08:51.939 --> 08:54.374
Moe, my in-laws are coming.

08:54.442 --> 08:57.344
I need something strong enough
that I forget I hate them,

08:57.411 --> 09:00.180
But not so strong
that I tell them I love them.

09:00.247 --> 09:02.582
Sorry, Homer, I ain't
serving no liquor.

09:02.650 --> 09:04.918
Just o'glums non-alcohol beer.

09:04.986 --> 09:06.953
Marge, this is crazy!

09:07.021 --> 09:09.089
This is my mother's
80th birthday party,

09:09.156 --> 09:10.790
And you're not ruining it.

09:10.858 --> 09:12.592
Oh, you'll have a good time.

09:12.660 --> 09:14.361
I invited a friend for you.

09:14.428 --> 09:17.630
Knock-a-doodle-you!
Flanders?!

09:17.698 --> 09:19.032
Neighbor Marge invited me over

09:19.100 --> 09:20.767
To be the little angel
on your shoulder,

09:20.835 --> 09:23.103
So you wouldn't listen
to the 400 devils on the other.

09:23.170 --> 09:24.571
D'oh!

09:24.638 --> 09:26.773
D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh!

09:26.841 --> 09:29.275
* *

09:32.179 --> 09:34.381
Hey, chunky
with the pants of meatballs.

09:34.448 --> 09:36.216
Take our picture.

09:36.283 --> 09:37.951
All right.

09:38.019 --> 09:38.752
I wasn't smiling!

09:38.819 --> 09:39.919
What the...

09:39.987 --> 09:41.021
I had something in my teeth.

09:41.088 --> 09:42.188
Why you...

09:42.256 --> 09:43.223
My eyes were shut.

09:43.290 --> 09:44.791
Lousy...

09:44.859 --> 09:46.893
My sweater's on backwards!

09:46.961 --> 09:48.695
He can't do anything right.

09:48.763 --> 09:50.930
Except setting off car alarms
with his big fat footsteps.

09:50.998 --> 09:52.665
You take that back!

09:58.973 --> 10:00.673
Go ugly up someone
else's house,

10:00.741 --> 10:03.076
You penis-curling
she-devils!

10:03.144 --> 10:04.644
Ah, you got it.

10:04.712 --> 10:06.413
We're not staying
where we're not wanted.

10:06.480 --> 10:07.747
Every time I plan something

10:07.815 --> 10:11.351
That means something to me,
you somehow mess it up.

10:17.792 --> 10:20.026
I need some cash, man.

10:22.696 --> 10:24.931
"you will lose all your money."

10:24.999 --> 10:27.200
we'll see about that.

10:34.587 --> 10:36.688
One, please.

10:36.756 --> 10:38.690
You had that scar
before you got on.

10:38.758 --> 10:40.759
What scar?
Oh, you'll find out.

10:42.361 --> 10:44.296
Oh, I like keeping, I like
keeping records of myself.

10:44.363 --> 10:47.065
Oh. Ah, man, do I make the soup.

10:47.133 --> 10:48.900
My goodness,
do I make the soup.

10:48.968 --> 10:50.602
Oh, I'm doomed!

10:50.670 --> 10:52.871
Now, we don't know
for sure it's your wife.

10:52.939 --> 10:54.272
It could be yours.

10:54.340 --> 10:55.640
Oh, no, sir.

10:55.708 --> 10:57.242
My marriage is solid.

10:57.310 --> 11:00.045
Manjula would never cheat on me
like I cheated on...

11:00.112 --> 11:02.047
Oh, boy.
That's right.

11:02.114 --> 11:04.082
Now, was there ever a time

11:04.150 --> 11:06.384
When your wife might
have found comfort

11:06.452 --> 11:08.753
In Moe's hairy arms?

11:08.821 --> 11:10.388
Think back, apu.

11:10.456 --> 11:12.090
Think back, apu...

11:17.797 --> 11:19.464
May we use your restroom

11:19.532 --> 11:21.366
To change our kids out
of their cricket uniforms?

11:21.434 --> 11:22.867
We got caught in the rain

11:22.935 --> 11:26.638
Because someone wouldn't use
international short form rules.

11:26.706 --> 11:29.074
All right, calm down there,
'Pu and she-Pu.

11:29.141 --> 11:30.942
You can use the restroom.

11:31.010 --> 11:32.911
My one day off
and it is miserable.

11:32.979 --> 11:35.347
This is my day every day.

11:35.414 --> 11:36.615
You see this?

11:36.682 --> 11:39.017
I'm playing the world's
smallest sitar for you.

11:43.022 --> 11:44.823
One, two, three,
four, five, six...

11:46.192 --> 11:47.626
We are missing a tuplet!

11:47.693 --> 11:49.794
We must have left it
at that godforsaken pub!

11:49.862 --> 11:51.997
How could you forget
your own child?

11:52.064 --> 11:53.698
How could you forget
your own child?!

11:53.766 --> 11:55.767
Oh, I can't believe
I married you.

11:55.835 --> 11:58.336
What my grandfather saw
in your grandfather,

11:58.404 --> 12:00.171
I will never know.

12:01.574 --> 12:03.041
Uh, hey, 'Pu.

12:03.109 --> 12:05.377
I just want you to know that
I got one of your kids here.

12:05.444 --> 12:07.145
This ain't a kidnapping thing,

12:07.213 --> 12:09.114
But if you're in the mood
to give me a million dollars,

12:09.181 --> 12:10.348
That's cool.

12:10.416 --> 12:11.916
This should not be interpreted

12:11.984 --> 12:13.885
By federal agents as a threat.

12:13.953 --> 12:16.588
Once again, uh, no threat,
but will take the dough.

12:16.656 --> 12:19.057
Well, one of us has to go
back to Moe's.

12:19.125 --> 12:21.760
Maybe have a beer or two,
shoot a game of pool,

12:21.827 --> 12:24.162
And if I win,
I have to play the challenger,

12:24.230 --> 12:25.964
Such are the customs
of billiards.

12:27.466 --> 12:31.236
What a great father,
I say sarcastically!

12:31.303 --> 12:35.073
If only that mark on your
forehead was an off button!

12:35.141 --> 12:37.075
Hours later,
she returned--

12:37.143 --> 12:39.010
Smelling of beer
and pickled eggs.

12:39.078 --> 12:40.245
I know no more.

12:40.312 --> 12:42.113
Uh... I do.

12:42.181 --> 12:43.481
You do?! Tell me!

12:43.549 --> 12:45.884
I was there when your
wife got to Moe's,

12:45.951 --> 12:48.720
Being my usual
effervescent self.

12:53.059 --> 12:56.695
Oh, thank you for saving
my precious...

12:57.897 --> 12:59.764
...Gheet! (sighs)

12:59.832 --> 13:01.900
Sounds like you had a rough day.

13:01.967 --> 13:03.301
It's true.

13:03.369 --> 13:07.038
My eyes have more bags
than the Darjeeling limited.

13:07.106 --> 13:09.307
Yeah, that's-that's
probably a good one.

13:09.375 --> 13:11.676
Here, I got somethin'
that might cheer ya up.

13:11.744 --> 13:13.611
I got this for women
that came to the bar,

13:13.679 --> 13:16.347
And, uh, low-blow boxing
for the guys.

13:16.415 --> 13:18.917
My nards! My nards! My nards!

13:18.984 --> 13:20.819
So, uh, would you
like to cut one?

13:20.886 --> 13:22.220
I mean a rug.

13:22.288 --> 13:23.922
Oh, God, I always say
the wrong thing.

13:25.224 --> 13:30.361
* red one, konvict gaga... *

13:30.429 --> 13:32.897
You said you'd be
home by 7:00

13:32.965 --> 13:34.632
To help with my
mother's birthday!

13:36.669 --> 13:38.303
Then what happened?
I don't know.

13:39.538 --> 13:41.606
Teacup? How'd that get in there?

13:41.674 --> 13:44.209
Question me,
you little rutabaga brain,

13:44.276 --> 13:46.811
I'll take your eyeball
and make soup out of it.

13:46.879 --> 13:48.913
Well, how can you be sure
your wife is not the putty

13:48.981 --> 13:50.281
In the bartender's hands?

13:50.349 --> 13:51.616
Yeah, padre.

13:51.684 --> 13:54.152
How innocuous
are your flashbacks?

13:54.220 --> 13:56.187
Well, I, uh...

13:58.324 --> 14:00.959
The ferry will be back
in ten minutes.

14:01.026 --> 14:04.863
It'll take us home to
find out the truth.

14:04.930 --> 14:06.731
The truth.
The roof.

14:11.303 --> 14:13.538
I'm still mad at you
from last night.

14:13.606 --> 14:16.574
Today's the first,
which means it was last month,

14:16.642 --> 14:18.843
Which means you're
being ridiculous.

14:18.911 --> 14:21.780
Hmm, I'm glad we never
argue like that.

14:21.847 --> 14:25.250
Yes, to argue, you have to
actually talk to each other.

14:25.317 --> 14:27.552
Way to bitch up the
conversation, Helen.

14:29.155 --> 14:30.822
Oh, Tim.

14:30.890 --> 14:32.657
As your spiritual advisor,

14:32.725 --> 14:35.560
I'm afraid you two have
a b-b-b-big problem.

14:35.628 --> 14:36.995
Me and Helen?

14:37.062 --> 14:39.030
Why, we're as happy
as Adam and eve

14:39.098 --> 14:41.533
Before eve munched us
all to hell.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.134
Mm-mm-mmm.

14:43.202 --> 14:45.003
I'm gonna let you in
on a little trick

14:45.070 --> 14:46.771
They taught us in
divinity school.

14:46.839 --> 14:48.439
Now take a look at
Helen over there.

14:48.507 --> 14:50.708
She seems happy as a
clam, am I right?

14:50.776 --> 14:52.177
Oh, happier.

14:52.244 --> 14:56.014
Where a clam has only one
pearl, she has many.

14:56.081 --> 14:58.349
Now, don't you jive me, Tim.

14:58.417 --> 15:01.686
Just take your thumb and
put it over her mouth.

15:06.525 --> 15:07.826
See?

15:07.893 --> 15:10.695
Looks like that she-cano
is about to blow!

15:10.763 --> 15:13.565
* Krakatoa, East of Java *

15:13.632 --> 15:15.567
* never spewed a hotter lava *

15:15.634 --> 15:19.237
* than a mount Saint Helen
who's mad at you *

15:19.305 --> 15:21.940
* Kilauea or you
will pay her... *

15:28.247 --> 15:30.014
Is the preacher here?

15:30.082 --> 15:32.350
'cause there's somethin'
I gotta get off of my chest.

15:32.418 --> 15:34.285
Somethin' more suited
for the town gossip

15:34.353 --> 15:35.954
Than the minister's wife.

15:36.021 --> 15:37.522
Do tell.

15:37.590 --> 15:40.859
Uh... Well,
there's this married woman

15:40.926 --> 15:42.961
That I have feelings for.

15:43.028 --> 15:45.663
And her husband don't realize
how upset she is with him.

15:45.731 --> 15:47.098
Do I know her?

15:47.166 --> 15:49.701
I'm, uh...
I'm sure you do.

15:49.768 --> 15:51.603
Oh.

15:51.670 --> 15:53.238
What's so damn funny?

15:53.305 --> 15:54.706
I mean... (chuckles)

15:54.773 --> 15:56.708
Oh.

15:58.477 --> 16:00.111
That's right.

16:00.179 --> 16:02.313
She touched his knee.

16:02.381 --> 16:04.716
His knee.
Dad,

16:04.783 --> 16:07.552
I'm gonna need some help
getting this off.

16:12.862 --> 16:15.864
Otto, you got to get us
back to town.

16:15.932 --> 16:19.067
Oh, nobody told me
I had to drive the bus back.

16:19.135 --> 16:21.937
I've mistimed some substances!

16:29.479 --> 16:30.546
Here it comes,

16:30.613 --> 16:31.713
The moment of truth.

16:35.385 --> 16:37.753
She's packing her bag.

16:37.820 --> 16:39.821
So it is you,
Mr. Homer.

16:39.889 --> 16:41.256
But let's be honest.

16:41.324 --> 16:43.859
A woman her age
married to a man of--

16:43.927 --> 16:45.661
How old are you, 65?

16:45.728 --> 16:47.429
Thirty-nine.

16:47.497 --> 16:50.299
Dear God, this day gets
more and more disturbing.

16:53.870 --> 16:55.671
Marge! No!
Stop packing your...

16:55.738 --> 16:57.039
Painting supplies?!

16:57.106 --> 16:58.473
Grandma?!

16:58.541 --> 17:00.509
What do you think?

17:00.577 --> 17:02.611
You're not leaving me?

17:02.679 --> 17:04.146
My mother explained

17:04.213 --> 17:06.515
That what happened at the
party wasn't your fault.

17:06.583 --> 17:08.450
It's that Patty and Selma.

17:08.518 --> 17:10.319
There's something evil
about them.

17:10.386 --> 17:12.721
Did you know they smoked
when I was pregnant?

17:12.789 --> 17:14.756
Oh, Marge,
you're not leaving with Moe

17:14.824 --> 17:18.627
Is the best thing
that never happened to me.

17:19.963 --> 17:21.128
Okay, reverend,

17:21.196 --> 17:22.431
Your place is next.

17:22.498 --> 17:24.900
Actually, milhouse
and I are next.

17:24.968 --> 17:26.835
Huh. There's no suspense
at your place.

17:26.903 --> 17:28.270
Even I've hooked up
with your old lady.

17:28.338 --> 17:29.638
Sorry, kid.

17:29.706 --> 17:32.641
You were my favorite Uncle,
Uncle Otto.

17:43.653 --> 17:45.954
Two tickets to Istanbul?

17:46.022 --> 17:47.356
That's right, Tim.

17:47.423 --> 17:49.858
I'm taking these bags,
and I'm walking out that door.

17:49.926 --> 17:51.860
Meanwhile, you'll be
setting the alarm,

17:51.928 --> 17:53.595
And then you'll join me
in the cab.

17:53.663 --> 17:56.131
You're leaving... With me?

17:56.199 --> 17:58.066
Would you rather
I bring someone else

17:58.134 --> 18:01.870
On the world's most
romantic train?

18:01.938 --> 18:03.672
Oh, Helen.

18:05.408 --> 18:06.942
Is that a train in your pocket

18:07.010 --> 18:08.443
Or are you just happy
to see me?

18:08.511 --> 18:09.611
Both.

18:11.180 --> 18:12.948
And so it is me.

18:25.695 --> 18:29.164
I feel the pain of
a thousand squishee headaches.

18:34.037 --> 18:37.139
My worst fears are confirmed.

18:37.206 --> 18:39.007
Apu, this man has come here
to convince me

18:39.075 --> 18:41.009
To do something I never
thought I would do...

18:41.077 --> 18:42.544
Stay with you.

18:42.612 --> 18:44.446
You mean you are
not leaving me for him?

18:44.514 --> 18:46.448
Don't be ridiculous.

18:46.516 --> 18:48.483
What am I, blind and noseless?

18:48.551 --> 18:49.718
Hey, hey, I'm right here.

18:49.786 --> 18:51.853
Believe me, I know.

18:51.921 --> 18:54.456
Apu, our marriage
will never be easy.

18:54.524 --> 18:56.858
But nothing worth
doing is ever easy.

18:56.926 --> 18:58.160
It is true.

18:58.227 --> 19:00.929
The tastiest ice cream
is the hardest to scoop.

19:00.997 --> 19:03.131
But if you wrap something
warm around it...

19:03.199 --> 19:04.399
Oh.

19:04.467 --> 19:05.701
Very nice.

19:05.768 --> 19:07.102
Well all's well that
ends well, huh?

19:07.170 --> 19:08.770
Yes, except for...

19:08.838 --> 19:11.006
Why did you write
that horrible letter?!

19:11.074 --> 19:13.709
When I saw how much trouble
your marriages were in...

19:15.211 --> 19:17.979
<i>...I knew I had to act fast.</i>

19:18.047 --> 19:20.082
<i>I got Marge's mother
to go to Marge,</i>

19:20.149 --> 19:21.383
<i>Convinced Helen to ride
the rails of romance</i>

19:21.451 --> 19:23.185
<i>With the padre,</i>

19:23.252 --> 19:25.721
<i>Then I bought some
roadside corn, ate it raw,</i>

19:25.788 --> 19:28.757
<i>Got a kernel in my teeth,
flossed with the corn silk,</i>

19:28.825 --> 19:30.859
<i>And then I came over
to fix things with manjula.</i>

19:30.927 --> 19:33.829
And I wrote that letter so
you three chumps would realize

19:33.896 --> 19:37.399
That you have not been treatin'
your wives the way they deserve.

19:37.467 --> 19:38.967
Think of it as
a wake-up call

19:39.035 --> 19:41.603
From a man who ain't got
nothin' but a blow-up doll.

19:41.671 --> 19:43.205
And even she left me.

19:43.272 --> 19:44.906
Should not have used helium.

19:44.974 --> 19:48.176
Moe, I don't know whether
to punch you or kiss you.

19:48.244 --> 19:49.778
So I'm gonna do both.

19:50.980 --> 19:52.347
Yeck.

19:52.415 --> 19:54.216
<i>So all you mugs out there,</i>

19:54.283 --> 19:57.686
<i>Be sure you don't take
for granted the woman you love.</i>

19:57.754 --> 20:00.655
<i>Oh, and it's mother's day,
so call your ma.</i>

20:00.723 --> 20:03.191
<i>Take her down to the diner
at the department store there.</i>

20:03.259 --> 20:05.127
<i>Get her a roast beef on rye.</i>

20:05.194 --> 20:07.496
<i>Oh, and make sure she gets
a fruit cup on the side.</i>

20:07.563 --> 20:09.164
<i>She's worth it.</i>
