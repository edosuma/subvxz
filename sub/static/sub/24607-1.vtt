29:00.913 --> 29:02.044
ALL MORNING.

29:02.088 --> 29:02.915
6 YEARS
AND 7 DAYS.

29:02.958 --> 29:04.873
HARPER: HEY,
TIME VIOLATION.

29:04.917 --> 29:08.355
DISHES, LATRINE, OR MURPHY?
YOU CHOOSE.

29:08.398 --> 29:10.574
I'M SORRY.

29:10.618 --> 29:12.968
WE SAID WE WOULDN'T
TALK ABOUT IT,

29:13.012 --> 29:15.928
AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE DOING
EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN.

29:21.411 --> 29:23.979
-YEAH, RIGHT.

29:24.023 --> 29:26.025
I CHOOSE MURPHY.

29:29.680 --> 29:32.640
I'D HAVE GONE
WITH LATRINES.

29:42.128 --> 29:43.912
UH!

29:43.956 --> 29:46.262
THIS IS MY SIDE
OF THE SHIP, REMEMBER?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

29:46.306 --> 29:48.569
YOU WANTED ME TO TRAIN,
RIGHT, SO LET'S DO IT.

29:48.612 --> 29:50.310
-RRGH!
-AH!

29:52.965 --> 29:56.577
ALL RIGHT, BUT I WIN,
YOU COME BACK TO THE GROUP.

29:56.620 --> 29:59.406
NO DEAL.

29:59.449 --> 30:01.060
YOU HAVE
TOO MANY RULES.

30:01.103 --> 30:05.978
BESIDES, THERE'S NO ONE
TO DISAPPOINT OVER HERE.

30:06.021 --> 30:07.370
MURPHY--UH!

30:09.111 --> 30:10.547
AHH! HEH.

30:10.591 --> 30:12.332
-THAT'S A GOOD PUNCH.

30:12.375 --> 30:13.637
NOW, IF YOU
SHIFT YOUR WEIGHT

30:13.681 --> 30:16.553
WHEN YOU THROW IT,
MIGHT ACTUALLY HURT.

30:16.597 --> 30:18.642
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK
YOUR PROBLEM IS?

30:18.686 --> 30:19.861
THIS SHOULD BE GOOD.

30:19.905 --> 30:22.472
YOU LIKE
BEING A HERO,

30:22.516 --> 30:25.649
EXCEPT UP HERE,
THERE ARE NO HEROES.

30:25.693 --> 30:28.870
YOU'RE AFRAID YOU'D
BECOME WORTHLESS AGAIN.

30:28.914 --> 30:30.393
UH! HUH!

30:30.437 --> 30:32.482
-RRGH!
-UH! UHH...

30:32.526 --> 30:35.007
YOU'RE NOT
WORTHLESS, MURPHY.

30:35.050 --> 30:37.836
WAIT, WAIT.
BELLAMY, LOOK. OH!

30:37.879 --> 30:40.012
SAY YOU'RE NOT WORTHLESS,
AND I'LL LET YOU GO.

30:40.055 --> 30:42.188
NOT KIDDING!
WILL YOU LOOK? LOOK!

30:50.022 --> 30:52.676
LET'S GO.

30:52.720 --> 30:53.939
COME ON.

30:57.507 --> 30:59.118
MURPHY:
IT'S BEEN 2 1/2 HOURS.

30:59.161 --> 31:01.294
WHY, EXACTLY, ARE WE
SITTING HERE IN THE DARK?

31:01.337 --> 31:02.382
WE SHOULD LIGHT UP
THE RING,

31:02.425 --> 31:03.470
LET THEM KNOW
WE'RE HERE.

31:03.513 --> 31:04.558
QUIET, MURPHY.

31:04.601 --> 31:05.646
FIRST, WE FIND OUT
WHO THEY ARE,

31:05.689 --> 31:07.691
AND THEN WE ASK
THEM FOR HELP.

31:10.694 --> 31:12.566
-NOTHING.

31:12.609 --> 31:14.524
RADIO SOUNDS.
THEIR COMMS MIGHT BE DISABLED.

31:14.568 --> 31:15.874
OR THE SHIP
COULD BE UNMANNED.

31:15.917 --> 31:17.527
MURPHY: OR IT'S MANNED
BY ALIENS WHO PREFER

31:17.571 --> 31:19.225
ANAL PROBES
TO RADIOS.

31:19.268 --> 31:20.617
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
AS LONG AS THEY

31:20.661 --> 31:22.358
GET US DOWN
TO THE GROUND.

31:22.402 --> 31:23.969
I'M TURNING ON
THE LIGHTS.

31:24.012 --> 31:26.188
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S ENOUGH.

31:26.232 --> 31:28.277
WE MAKE DECISIONS
AS A TEAM HERE,

31:28.321 --> 31:31.193
EVEN IF WE CAN'T STAND
THE SIGHT OF EACH OTHER.

31:31.237 --> 31:34.805
LOOK. ALL I'M SAYING IS,
IT WASN'T THERE YESTERDAY.

31:34.849 --> 31:36.329
NOW IT'S IN
GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT,

31:36.372 --> 31:38.374
WHICH MEANS SOMEONE
IS PILOTING IT, CORRECT?

31:38.418 --> 31:40.376
HARPER:
IT COULD BE AN AI.

31:40.420 --> 31:41.551
MURPHY: I PREFER
THE ALIENS.

31:41.595 --> 31:43.553
SOMETHING'S
HAPPENING.

31:43.597 --> 31:45.816
A SECOND SHIP.

31:47.731 --> 31:49.037
LOOK.

31:50.996 --> 31:53.085
THAT MUST BE
A TRANSPORT.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.566
IT'S HEADED
FOR THE GROUND.

31:56.610 --> 31:59.482
EMORI, FIRE UP
THE RADIO.

31:59.526 --> 32:01.354
NOW SHE WANTS
TO TALK.

32:04.444 --> 32:05.924
MAYDAY, MAYDAY.

32:05.967 --> 32:08.187
I AM HAILING THE DROP SHIP
NOW ON RE-ENTRY TO EARTH.

32:08.230 --> 32:11.233
WE ARE STRANDED ABOARD
THE SPACE STATION TO YOUR WEST.

32:11.277 --> 32:14.758
PLEASE RESPOND.

32:16.456 --> 32:17.979
MURPHY: GREAT.

32:18.023 --> 32:19.415
LOOKS LIKE WE JUST
LOST OUR LAST CHANCE

32:19.459 --> 32:20.416
TO GET BACK
TO THE GROUND.

32:20.460 --> 32:21.896
MAYDAY, MAYDAY.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.246
I AM CALLING THE DROP SHIP
NOW ON RE-ENTRY TO EARTH.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.602
MADI, PACK UP THE ROVER.

32:32.646 --> 32:34.604
GET IT OUT OF SIGHT
AND LOAD THE GUNS.

32:34.648 --> 32:38.043
-ALL OF THEM.

32:48.488 --> 32:51.056
WHO ARE THEY?
WHY ARE YOU SO SCARED?

32:51.099 --> 32:53.014
I WILL NOT LET ANYTHING
HAPPEN TO YOU.

32:53.058 --> 32:55.103
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

32:55.147 --> 32:57.671
WELL, MAYBE
THEY'RE FRIENDLY.

32:57.714 --> 32:59.716
MAYBE.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.022
LOOK. UNTIL
I FIGURE THIS OUT,

33:01.066 --> 33:02.893
I WANT YOU TO HIDE
IN YOUR SECRET SPOT.

33:02.937 --> 33:04.025
NO. CLARKE--

33:04.069 --> 33:06.201
THIS IS NOT UP FOR
DISCUSSION, MADI.

33:06.245 --> 33:08.638
THE FLAMEKEEPER SCOUTS
NEVER FOUND YOU THERE.

33:08.682 --> 33:12.425
NEITHER WILL THEY.

33:14.209 --> 33:17.821
PROMISE ME YOU'LL
STAY IN THE HOLE.

33:17.865 --> 33:19.127
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

33:19.171 --> 33:21.912
I'LL BE BACK
AS SOON AS I CAN.

33:21.956 --> 33:24.611
NOW PROMISE ME.

33:24.654 --> 33:27.005
I PROMISE.

33:28.745 --> 33:30.312
HERE.

33:31.966 --> 33:35.143
IF YOU SHOOT,
THEY'LL HEAR YOU.

33:35.187 --> 33:37.537
I'LL MAKE SURE
IT'S MY ONLY CHOICE.

33:39.234 --> 33:40.366
GO.

34:25.802 --> 34:28.457
ALL CLEAR.

34:49.261 --> 34:52.133
SO MUCH FOR THE MEEK
INHERITING THE EARTH.

34:55.615 --> 34:57.834
WHATEVER TOOK OUT
THE REST OF THE WORLD

34:57.878 --> 34:59.097
MUST HAVE MISSED
THIS SPOT.

34:59.140 --> 35:00.620
YOU THINK?

35:02.056 --> 35:03.753
YOU WERE RIGHT.

35:03.797 --> 35:06.016
SPENDING EXTRA TIME IN ORBIT
TO FIND THIS PLACE

35:06.060 --> 35:07.757
WAS A GOOD CALL.

35:07.801 --> 35:10.020
NOW SEE IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED

35:10.064 --> 35:11.892
TO OUR PLANET
WHILE WE WERE ASLEEP.

35:11.935 --> 35:13.241
ON IT.

35:13.285 --> 35:15.896
UH, NONVIOLENT
OFFENDERS WITH ME?

35:15.939 --> 35:18.290
YEAH, BOTH OF THEM.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.164
SMART.

35:23.208 --> 35:24.774
GIVE HIM THAT.

35:24.818 --> 35:26.428
RELAX, MCCREARY.

35:26.472 --> 35:29.562
YOU'RE STILL MY
FAVORITE MASS MURDERER.

35:29.605 --> 35:32.173
SWEEP THE VILLAGE
DOOR TO DOOR,

35:32.217 --> 35:33.827
THEN THE WOODS.

35:33.870 --> 35:36.482
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT
WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE.

36:16.043 --> 36:19.394
OUT! COME ON. NOW!
UH! RRGH...

36:23.224 --> 36:24.443
MAN: WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS?

36:24.486 --> 36:26.619
LITTLE BITCH
SHOT ME.

36:29.448 --> 36:31.624
MAN: AW, COME ON, MAN.
YOU GONNA SHOOT A KID?

36:31.667 --> 36:32.668
WHY NOT?

36:32.712 --> 36:35.889
FOR STARTERS,
BECAUSE SHE'S A KID.

36:37.238 --> 36:38.457
HOW ABOUT I PUT ONE
IN YOUR LEG

36:38.500 --> 36:40.720
SO YOU KNOW
HOW IT FEELS?

36:41.764 --> 36:42.722
UGH!

36:42.765 --> 36:44.593
UGH...

36:44.637 --> 36:45.594
CLARKE: RAAGH!

36:45.638 --> 36:46.595
-UH!
-OOH!

36:46.639 --> 36:47.857
UHH!

36:47.901 --> 36:49.207
AAGH!

36:49.250 --> 36:50.208
-RRGH...
-UGH...

36:50.251 --> 36:51.687
RRGH!

36:51.731 --> 36:53.254
-UGH...
-CLARKE!

36:57.737 --> 36:59.782
UH!

37:04.222 --> 37:06.136
HEY, IT'S OK.

37:09.270 --> 37:12.534
WAIT. HE TRIED
TO HELP ME.

37:12.578 --> 37:15.058
I THINK HE MIGHT
BE A GOOD GUY.

37:15.102 --> 37:17.104
THERE ARE
NO GOOD GUYS.

37:17.147 --> 37:18.714
UH!

37:19.802 --> 37:22.892
JENSON, BAINES,
WE HEARD TWO MORE

37:22.936 --> 37:24.894
GUNSHOTS
IN YOUR DIRECTION.

37:24.938 --> 37:26.809
REPORT.

37:29.769 --> 37:31.074
WHAT'S IT MEAN?

37:31.118 --> 37:32.337
MAN:
FAN OUT. NOW.

37:32.380 --> 37:34.513
MEANS WE'RE
NOT ALONE.

37:38.473 --> 37:41.694
MONTY, COME ON.
PACK YOUR THINGS.

37:41.737 --> 37:44.566
I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD DO THIS.

37:44.610 --> 37:47.395
LOOK. I KNOW
IT'S A RISK,

37:47.439 --> 37:49.136
BUT THEY HAVE
A TRANSPORT,

37:49.179 --> 37:50.485
WHICH MEANS
THEY CARRY FUEL.

37:50.529 --> 37:51.530
WE CAN DO THIS.

37:51.573 --> 37:53.488
WHAT IF IT'S
THE WRONG FUEL?

37:53.532 --> 37:55.011
WE'LL NEED TO BURN
MOST OF WHAT WE HAVE LEFT

37:55.055 --> 37:57.057
JUST TO DOCK, WHICH MEANS
WE WON'T HAVE ENOUGH

37:57.100 --> 37:58.537
TO GET BACK HERE
TO THE PLACE

37:58.580 --> 38:00.582
WHERE WE'VE BEEN SAFE
FOR THE LAST 6 YEARS.

38:00.626 --> 38:03.803
WE LEAVE,
WE CAN'T COME BACK.

38:03.846 --> 38:06.196
IS THAT REALLY A RISK
YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE?

38:06.240 --> 38:07.328
YES. IT IS.

38:07.372 --> 38:09.939
WHAT IF THEY WON'T
LET US DOCK?

38:19.035 --> 38:21.473
WHAT'S THIS
REALLY ABOUT?

38:22.952 --> 38:26.565
HEY, TALK TO ME.

38:27.653 --> 38:30.786
I KILLED MY MOTHER.

38:30.830 --> 38:32.527
I LET MY BEST FRIEND
KILL HIMSELF.

38:32.571 --> 38:34.094
OH, IT WASN'T
YOUR FAULT, MONTY.

38:34.137 --> 38:36.966
I COULD HAVE
DONE MORE.

38:37.010 --> 38:40.143
I DON'T WANT TO BE
THAT PERSON AGAIN.

38:40.187 --> 38:42.145
OH...

38:42.189 --> 38:44.452
YOU ARE STRONG, MONTY.

38:44.496 --> 38:47.499
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS
WHY I LOVE YOU.

38:50.589 --> 38:52.765
NO ONE SHOULD HAVE
TO BE THAT STRONG.

39:08.389 --> 39:09.782
EMORI: REMEMBER,
RADIO ME WHEN JOHN GETS

39:09.825 --> 39:11.523
TO THE HANGAR BAY
SO I CAN GO GET MY--

39:11.566 --> 39:14.090
SAVED YOU
THE TROUBLE.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.268
THANKS.

39:18.312 --> 39:20.532
I'LL START
THE PREFLIGHT CHECK.

39:22.272 --> 39:25.275
WELL, YOU BLEW
A GOOD THING.

39:25.319 --> 39:26.581
THANKS FOR
THE EMPATHY.

39:26.625 --> 39:27.843
SORRY. JUST,
HAVING A ROOMMATE

39:27.887 --> 39:29.367
FOR THE LAST 6 MONTHS
BECAUSE SHE MADE YOU

39:29.410 --> 39:31.020
FEEL INADEQUATE
HAS GOT ME FEELING

39:31.064 --> 39:32.457
A LITTLE CRANKY.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.372
HMM. HERE I WAS,
THINKING IT WAS

39:34.415 --> 39:35.547
BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T
GET US BACK DOWN

39:35.590 --> 39:37.723
TO THE GROUND.

39:37.766 --> 39:39.377
THAT'S THE THING
THEY DON'T TELL YOU

39:39.420 --> 39:41.291
ABOUT HAPPILY
EVER AFTER--

39:41.335 --> 39:42.380
HARDER THAN IT LOOKS.

39:42.423 --> 39:44.294
HMM, YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS IS?

39:44.338 --> 39:45.818
IT'S A COCKROACH
PLAYING THE VIOLIN.

39:45.861 --> 39:48.864
-OH.
-GOING THE WRONG WAY.

39:48.908 --> 39:51.563
FINAL SWEEP.
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

39:58.613 --> 40:01.529
BELLAMY: WOULDN'T IT BE
EASIER JUST TO STEP OUTSIDE?

40:05.315 --> 40:07.840
WHAT ARE WE GONNA
BE NOW, BELLAMY?

40:10.016 --> 40:12.888
HEY...LOOK.

40:12.932 --> 40:15.587
NOTHING IS GONNA
CHANGE ON THE GROUND.

40:22.768 --> 40:24.465
I WISH THAT
WERE TRUE.

40:24.509 --> 40:26.598
OH, I KNOW IT IS.

40:26.641 --> 40:28.991
WE'VE KEPT
EACH OTHER ALIVE,

40:29.035 --> 40:30.602
ALL OF US.

40:30.645 --> 40:33.082
WE'RE FAMILY, AND
NOTHING CAN CHANGE THAT.

40:33.126 --> 40:36.259
I'M STILL BANISHED.

40:36.303 --> 40:37.609
WHAT IF
OCTAVIA TRIES--

40:37.652 --> 40:39.437
-NO. SHE WON'T.
-YOU DO REMEMBER,

40:39.480 --> 40:42.265
I ALMOST KILLED
YOUR SISTER.

40:42.309 --> 40:44.354
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE SCREWED.

40:45.878 --> 40:48.402
MY SISTER WILL
UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW,

40:48.446 --> 40:52.450
AND IF SHE'S OK
AND ALIVE AND--

40:52.493 --> 40:54.452
SHH...

40:54.495 --> 40:56.497
SHE'S OK.

40:58.978 --> 41:01.850
THEN SHE'LL
FORGIVE YOU, TOO.

41:01.894 --> 41:05.245
BELLAMY, IT
TOOK YOU 3 YEARS.

41:05.288 --> 41:06.942
I'M MORE STUBBORN
THAN HER.

41:06.986 --> 41:08.683
-HA HA!
-GOOD.

41:08.727 --> 41:11.120
TRUST ME, WHATEVER WE
RUN INTO DOWN THERE,

41:11.164 --> 41:14.994
OCTAVIA WILL BE
THE LEAST OF OUR WORRIES.

41:24.482 --> 41:25.874
-UH!
-AGH!

41:31.010 --> 41:35.841
UH! AAGH!

41:35.884 --> 41:37.190
YAH!
