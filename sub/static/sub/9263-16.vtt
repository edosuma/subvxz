WEBVTT

00:00.216 --> 00:01.397
Julie, You skipped class?

00:01.624 --> 00:02.836
It was only one time.

00:02.887 --> 00:05.497
Look, Miss Taylor, we're really sorry--
we'll never do it again.

00:05.837 --> 00:06.772
That color
looks good on you.

00:06.833 --> 00:07.902
You should get it.

00:08.200 --> 00:09.197
I don't know.

00:09.622 --> 00:10.948
I don't really have
the money for it.

00:14.811 --> 00:18.099
You have been invited
to training camp in Austin.

00:18.212 --> 00:18.880
No way!

00:18.926 --> 00:20.420
Coaches evaluate the players

00:20.483 --> 00:21.799
and then choose the new members

00:21.839 --> 00:25.305
for the national quad rugby
squad for the U. S. of A.

00:25.384 --> 00:26.601
Yeah, he's gonna
have these rally girls

00:26.639 --> 00:28.110
fawning all over him
until Spring.

00:28.118 --> 00:29.631
Julie, I'm sorry.
Okay?

00:29.947 --> 00:31.792
I don't appreciate
getting lied to.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.862
Guys like Smash are fearless.

00:34.916 --> 00:36.893
They're dangerous.
They're like junkyard dogs.

00:36.896 --> 00:37.642
How do you mean?

00:37.646 --> 00:39.562
I'm not saying
that all black guys are dumb.

00:39.566 --> 00:41.691
Wait, I'm not Jesse Jackson.

00:41.737 --> 00:42.883
My cause is football.

00:42.937 --> 00:45.142
Look, look, look,
sooner or later

00:45.766 --> 00:48.193
you're gonna have to peek out
from behind those blinders.

00:48.438 --> 00:50.832
You boys deaf or something?
I said, "On my whistle!"

00:50.925 --> 00:51.842
Ready?

00:54.058 --> 00:55.772
I'm not gonna tell you again!

00:56.225 --> 00:58.803
Get your asses down there!
On my whistle!

01:04.988 --> 01:06.652
So you think
that there's racial problem

01:06.657 --> 01:07.753
with the Dillon Panthers.

01:07.855 --> 01:08.711
Without a doubt.

01:08.907 --> 01:10.573
How so? Are you saying
that black players

01:10.578 --> 01:12.593
are being treated differently
than white players?

01:13.296 --> 01:15.561
No, it's not about the treatment.
It's about the attitude.

01:16.468 --> 01:18.043
Look, all we want
is equality and respect.

01:19.348 --> 01:22.040
Well, there are 16 black players
on the varsity roster.

01:22.228 --> 01:24.100
That's more than 25%
of your team.

01:24.397 --> 01:25.591
And a lot of them are starters.

01:25.705 --> 01:28.670
Are you saying that blacks aren't
getting enough opportunity to play?

01:29.168 --> 01:30.610
No, no, it's not about that,

01:30.965 --> 01:31.652
all right?

01:32.086 --> 01:33.802
It's about certain people
in charge

01:34.015 --> 01:35.920
making assumptions
about other players on the team

01:35.937 --> 01:37.162
just because of they color.

01:37.417 --> 01:38.613
And nothing being
done about it.

01:39.018 --> 01:40.191
You mean Coach McGill?

01:40.768 --> 01:41.933
Yeah, you heard
what he said.

01:42.267 --> 01:44.452
Coach McGill has already issued
a public apology.

01:44.945 --> 01:46.310
Yeah, but those are just words.

01:46.608 --> 01:47.872
Are you saying
you want him fired?

01:48.386 --> 01:49.460
That'd be a good start.

01:50.025 --> 01:52.343
The loss of Anton.

01:52.896 --> 01:54.292
Seale is gone.

01:54.466 --> 01:55.751
Biggums is gone.

01:56.175 --> 01:57.511
Woods is gone.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.140
Cherry is gone.

01:59.356 --> 02:00.803
Smash is gone.

02:01.336 --> 02:03.003
Greer's gone.
We don't have a kicker.

02:03.576 --> 02:04.790
Anybody else?

02:05.207 --> 02:06.951
Baxter's gone.
We don't have a tailback.

02:07.748 --> 02:08.603
All right.

02:09.167 --> 02:10.612
Coach, I don't know what
to tell you.

02:11.795 --> 02:14.483
What we're gonna do is,
we're gonna dip into the JV.

02:14.588 --> 02:17.222
On one, ready? Go!
Three days, gentlemen.

02:17.245 --> 02:18.862
Three days. Let's go!
Fire it up.

02:18.868 --> 02:19.873
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

02:19.878 --> 02:20.742
Pick it up!

02:20.765 --> 02:21.630
Set!

02:22.507 --> 02:23.652
Blue, 80!

02:23.876 --> 02:25.413
Blue, 80!

02:25.515 --> 02:26.160
H ut!

02:28.047 --> 02:28.771
Tyler!

02:28.778 --> 02:29.891
- Where you go?
- Tyler!

02:29.977 --> 02:31.643
Tyler!
Tyler!

02:31.797 --> 02:32.783
Tyler!

02:33.585 --> 02:34.461
Tyler!

02:34.715 --> 02:36.013
What did I ask you to run?

02:36.058 --> 02:37.381
What did I ask you to run?

02:37.568 --> 02:38.613
- What's your name?
- Tyler.

02:38.636 --> 02:40.253
- What's your grandfather's name?
- Jim.

02:40.258 --> 02:41.861
- What's your mother's maiden name?
- Norman.

02:41.918 --> 02:43.640
How the hell can you
remember all that

02:43.688 --> 02:45.550
and not remember the route
I ask you to run?

02:45.647 --> 02:46.891
I don't know, sir.

02:48.987 --> 02:49.973
All right.
Huddle up.

02:49.986 --> 02:50.673
Come on.
Bring it in here.

02:50.675 --> 02:52.060
Have you heard what he said 21?

02:52.538 --> 02:54.143
First year or not,
you know this!

02:54.555 --> 02:55.643
Fix your chinstrap!

02:55.695 --> 02:57.343
He's good.
All right.

02:57.478 --> 02:59.310
Power right 24 pitch on one.

02:59.366 --> 03:00.372
Ready, break.

03:00.457 --> 03:01.310
Let's go!

03:01.865 --> 03:02.860
Set!

03:03.366 --> 03:04.791
White, nine!

03:05.148 --> 03:06.413
White, nine!

03:06.548 --> 03:07.272
Hut!

03:14.818 --> 03:16.453
What do you think you're doing?

03:16.716 --> 03:17.952
Tell me what you're running!

03:18.006 --> 03:19.113
- I don't know.
- Tell me!

03:19.256 --> 03:20.261
You don't know
what you're doing

03:20.278 --> 03:21.833
because you're supposed
to be blocking for me!

03:21.888 --> 03:23.402
You know how
to block yet, JV?

03:23.446 --> 03:24.972
There's no excuse
for that crap.

03:25.015 --> 03:25.521
G rady!

03:25.705 --> 03:27.503
You don't even deserve
to be out on this field!

03:27.516 --> 03:28.573
- Come here!
- That's a fact!

03:28.576 --> 03:29.222
You don't!

03:29.298 --> 03:30.821
- Shut your mouth and come here!
- Give me a break!

03:31.307 --> 03:32.163
Coach.

03:32.435 --> 03:33.820
- I was taking a hit like that.
- What the hell are you doing?

03:33.858 --> 03:34.853
I need a leader out here.

03:34.885 --> 03:36.633
You're the team captain.
I need you to lead.

03:36.657 --> 03:37.292
You understand me?

03:37.328 --> 03:38.972
I don't need you breaking
these guys down.

03:39.086 --> 03:40.190
I need you to set the tone,

03:40.225 --> 03:41.513
be the example.
You got me?

03:41.596 --> 03:42.233
Yes, sir.

03:42.345 --> 03:43.402
Can you do that for me?

03:43.407 --> 03:44.150
I can.

03:46.286 --> 03:46.971
Good.

03:47.465 --> 03:49.621
Allspaugh! Stager! Burdette!
Get over here!

03:51.567 --> 03:53.382
Listen up, we didn't
call you up from JV

03:53.507 --> 03:54.481
to scrimmage out here.

03:54.505 --> 03:56.791
The three of you might just be
playing Friday night in Dunston

03:56.808 --> 03:57.703
You understand me?

03:57.707 --> 03:58.933
- I can do it, coach.
- Listen, quiet.

03:59.315 --> 04:00.712
You're gonna stick
to him like

04:00.758 --> 04:02.002
paint on a car. 
You got it?

04:02.826 --> 04:04.930
You are gonna
get them up to speed.

04:05.935 --> 04:07.551
Consider yourselves
married now.

04:07.686 --> 04:08.951
Congratulations, gentlemen.

04:09.187 --> 04:10.912
Coach Spivey, Smith,
come here.

04:13.207 --> 04:14.381
I'm with you, Riggins.

04:15.138 --> 04:15.861
Shut up.

Coach McGill has already
issued a public apology.

05:07.757 --> 05:09.053
Yeah, but those are
just words.

05:09.306 --> 05:10.582
Are you saying
you want him fired?

05:10.955 --> 05:12.160
That'd be a good start.

05:12.233 --> 05:13.859
You have to admit,
the stakes are high.

05:13.969 --> 05:15.995
Should the Panthers lose
if you guys sit out,

05:16.084 --> 05:17.491
that's it,
the season's over.

05:17.659 --> 05:19.283
Are you and your teammates
prepared to play

05:19.288 --> 05:21.641
on Friday night
should Coach McGill be gone?

05:22.827 --> 05:23.991
Yeah. Yes, sir.

05:23.996 --> 05:24.790
Yes, we are.

05:24.795 --> 05:26.821
Yeah, we should
totally do that.

05:27.538 --> 05:28.290
You did?

05:28.398 --> 05:29.770
Your mom is so cool.

05:31.107 --> 05:33.823
Uh, yeah, um,
so I'll see you at school.

05:34.165 --> 05:34.791
Bye.

05:35.647 --> 05:36.401
Who's that?

05:36.686 --> 05:37.173
Tyra.

05:37.958 --> 05:40.692
Your father and I have been
wanting to talk to you about that.

05:40.736 --> 05:42.841
We have some concerns
about this new relationship

05:42.847 --> 05:44.302
you've got going with Tyra.

05:44.495 --> 05:46.072
I'm just kinda surprised
that's somebody

05:46.168 --> 05:47.602
you've chosen
to spend so much time with.

05:47.845 --> 05:50.142
Okay, first of all,
you don't even know Tyra.

05:50.195 --> 05:51.580
And second of all,
if this is about

05:51.635 --> 05:53.330
the whole cutting class
thing, I mean,

05:53.426 --> 05:54.783
you already punished me
for that, remember?

05:54.837 --> 05:56.671
Oh, no, actually that was
your guidance counselor.

05:56.718 --> 05:58.171
He was just trying to help you

05:58.277 --> 05:59.413
make up a grad

05:59.727 --> 06:00.771
This is your mother talking

06:00.836 --> 06:02.841
who knows for a fact
that you never skipped school

06:02.898 --> 06:04.593
before you started
hanging out with Tyra.

06:04.796 --> 06:06.091
What happened to Lois?

06:07.348 --> 06:09.392
Lois. What happened to Lois?
She was a nice girl.

06:09.517 --> 06:10.391
Okay

06:10.536 --> 06:13.280
so first you don't want me
dating Matt Saracen.

06:13.368 --> 06:15.001
Now you're picking
my friends for me.

06:15.345 --> 06:16.970
So maybe you guys
should just

06:18.376 --> 06:19.281
home school me.

06:19.916 --> 06:20.652
Honey,

06:21.085 --> 06:22.471
I don't like your tone.

06:22.575 --> 06:24.002
I don't like your sarcasm.

06:24.285 --> 06:25.901
And I really don't understand
what you see

06:25.905 --> 06:27.351
in hanging out
with this girl.

06:27.528 --> 06:29.622
She's been suspended
from school three times.

06:29.647 --> 06:30.421
Do you realize that?

06:30.466 --> 06:32.171
One time for drinking on campus.

06:32.227 --> 06:33.203
You know what it is?

06:34.527 --> 06:35.823
When there's one person

06:35.886 --> 06:36.843
who's involved

06:36.908 --> 06:37.840
with another person,

06:37.968 --> 06:38.930
and that first person

06:38.988 --> 06:40.283
is a person
who gets in trouble,

06:40.335 --> 06:41.532
who gets suspended,

06:41.585 --> 06:43.210
who doesn't wear enough clothes.

06:43.548 --> 06:44.593
That first person

06:44.656 --> 06:46.310
starts hanging around
with the second person,

06:46.497 --> 06:47.360
who happens to be

06:47.407 --> 06:49.031
a pretty darn good kid,

06:49.437 --> 06:50.632
very smart,

06:50.935 --> 06:53.373
smarter than what
I'm seeing right now.

06:53.867 --> 06:56.343
And the second person,
who is with that first person,

06:56.378 --> 06:57.972
starts going on the wrong path,

06:58.135 --> 06:59.560
that's a bit of a problem.

06:59.966 --> 07:02.411
Do you realize this is
the definition of prejudice?

07:03.107 --> 07:04.730
You guys are pre-judging her.

07:05.247 --> 07:07.623
And you know maybe if you
weren't so prejudiced,

07:07.917 --> 07:10.151
16 of your players wouldn't
have walked off the team.

07:10.337 --> 07:11.271
Watch your mouth.

07:11.298 --> 07:12.352
Maybe you should think
about that next time.

07:12.356 --> 07:13.190
You know what?
Come here a second.

07:13.208 --> 07:15.220
I don't like the way
you're talking, young lady.

07:15.285 --> 07:17.251
You and I are not finished
with this conversation.

07:22.076 --> 07:23.660
I mean, coming back
to school was fine

07:23.726 --> 07:24.943
and everything, but

07:25.506 --> 07:26.591
I mean,
this is a big deal.

07:26.645 --> 07:27.912
National Quad Rugby Team.

07:28.356 --> 07:29.833
They only give out
25 invitations.

07:29.876 --> 07:31.071
There's hundreds of players
across the country.

07:31.105 --> 07:32.013
I'm one of 'em, so...

07:32.126 --> 07:33.512
It sounds like
an amazing thing.

07:35.237 --> 07:37.132
A couple of weeks of school
is a long time to miss,

07:37.146 --> 07:38.360
and that's right
in the middle of finals.

07:38.376 --> 07:39.380
I understand that,

07:39.597 --> 07:40.121
but--

07:40.198 --> 07:41.283
For you to miss a couple weeks,

07:41.288 --> 07:42.610
it's gonna be hard for you
to come back in

07:42.628 --> 07:43.572
and take those finals.

07:43.636 --> 07:44.863
I'll just tackle it all
when I get back.

07:45.428 --> 07:47.702
You know, and Miss Taylor,
if worse comes to worse,

07:47.827 --> 07:48.573
then

07:48.767 --> 07:49.891
I'll just take the GED.

07:51.165 --> 07:52.281
Cause that's still
an option, right?

07:53.806 --> 07:54.612
- Yeah.
- Okay.

07:55.585 --> 07:56.543
Then it works out great.

07:57.168 --> 07:58.280
It just sounds to me

07:58.555 --> 07:59.733
like

08:00.158 --> 08:01.653
maybe you're putting
all your eggs

08:01.897 --> 08:03.071
in the quad rugby basket.

08:03.336 --> 08:04.002
Yeah, it does.

08:04.725 --> 08:06.481
That's pretty much exactly
what I'm doing.

08:07.408 --> 08:08.813
I'm putting
every single one of 'em in.

08:12.257 --> 08:13.203
This better work.

08:13.408 --> 08:14.450
It will, okay?

08:14.486 --> 08:15.503
I promise.
Nothing says

08:15.565 --> 08:17.502
I'm sorry like a mix CD.

08:17.896 --> 08:19.491
I'm a little bit worried
about the Bob Dylan.

08:19.936 --> 08:21.590
Gotta try to stay
in this century, man

08:21.647 --> 08:23.802
Hey, um, Tyra,

08:24.058 --> 08:26.441
do you know
where Julie is maybe?

08:27.015 --> 08:28.473
at's not what I think it is,
is it?

08:29.587 --> 08:30.691
What do you think it is?

08:31.066 --> 08:32.552
I think that's
a mixed CD.

08:33.107 --> 08:35.383
Yeah, I think you're trying to
trade a night in a hot tub

08:35.418 --> 08:37.441
with a bunch of rally girls
for a five-cent CD

08:37.465 --> 08:39.272
with a bunch
of sappy love songs on it.

08:39.816 --> 08:41.681
I told you that
that wasn't gonna work.

08:42.517 --> 08:43.273
Listen.

08:43.597 --> 08:45.230
Excuse  my friend here,
but I don't even think

08:45.288 --> 08:47.253
we've formally
been introduced.

08:47.408 --> 08:48.960
My name
is Landry Clark.

08:49.187 --> 08:50.413
You know, I just wanted to say

08:50.455 --> 08:51.841
that you are absolutely right.

08:51.975 --> 08:53.621
Yeah, well, how about
you two geniuses go back

08:53.625 --> 08:55.821
to your little lab
and cook something else up?

08:56.227 --> 08:58.311
Something that shows
a little bit more remorse.

08:58.875 --> 08:59.630
Okay.

08:59.787 --> 09:00.630
Here's a hint,

09:01.658 --> 09:02.650
spend some money.

09:02.795 --> 09:03.533
Spend some mon--

09:03.768 --> 09:05.183
Exactly, see, that's
what I've been--

09:05.287 --> 09:06.580
that's what I was trying
to tell you.

09:06.706 --> 09:08.320
That's the kinda thing
that girls like--

09:08.468 --> 09:09.381
You can go now.

09:09.618 --> 09:12.012
Tyra, I'm not gonna
let you down.

09:13.145 --> 09:13.871
Okay?

09:19.856 --> 09:21.261
Hey, what were you talking
to Matt about?

09:21.595 --> 09:23.030
You'll thank me for it later.

09:23.356 --> 09:23.972
Hey,

09:24.305 --> 09:25.722
you wanna go see
a movie tomorrow night?

09:28.927 --> 09:30.202
Um, sure. Yeah.

09:30.998 --> 09:32.221
If you launch this into odd-gap,

09:32.266 --> 09:33.911
quarterback plays
into an outlet play,

09:33.937 --> 09:34.683
what do you do?

09:34.895 --> 09:35.741
Go, Stager.

09:36.406 --> 09:38.561
- Okay, I know this. 
- Too late.

09:38.597 --> 09:39.300
Play's over.

09:39.357 --> 09:40.583
You waited too long
to make a decision,

09:40.615 --> 09:42.051
now we lost the game
because of you.

09:42.206 --> 09:43.150
We're not going to State,

09:43.158 --> 09:44.871
and the whole town
of Dillon hates you.

09:45.067 --> 09:46.680
You're never gonna get laid
your entire life.

09:46.966 --> 09:47.662
Fact.

09:48.915 --> 09:49.900
How's that feel
right now?

09:49.957 --> 09:51.180
Man,  you cracked down

09:51.215 --> 09:52.750
to your blocks.
Look for the quick toss.

09:52.777 --> 09:54.021
- Next.
- If I wanted you to speak,

09:54.045 --> 09:55.122
I would have spoken
to you.

09:55.506 --> 09:56.773
Besides, it's
completely wrong.

09:56.786 --> 09:58.171
All you do is check
into your tight end.

09:58.197 --> 09:59.300
Put your lunch away.

09:59.385 --> 10:00.131
You're not eating.

10:00.156 --> 10:01.992
And neither are you,
for that matter. Put it away.

10:07.157 --> 10:08.340
I want you gentlemen to take

10:08.378 --> 10:10.272
a good, long, hard look at this.

10:11.186 --> 10:12.671
He's a quitter.
All right?

10:15.245 --> 10:16.543
Man, you see that kid,
Allspaugh?

10:16.835 --> 10:18.733
He took my spot.
Who knows if I'm a get it back.

10:18.998 --> 10:20.201
Be cool.
All right?

10:20.407 --> 10:21.172
It's gonna be all right.

10:21.208 --> 10:22.432
Man, I gotta go to college.

10:22.707 --> 10:24.813
I am this close
to a scholarship.

10:25.375 --> 10:26.523
What you want me to do?
Kiss that good-bye?

10:26.638 --> 10:28.130
Chill out.
We all got something to lose.

10:28.326 --> 10:29.580
But it's a standoff.

10:29.637 --> 10:30.993
It all comes down
to who blinks first.

10:31.488 --> 10:32.870
We getting down
to it, man.

10:32.957 --> 10:33.743
I know.

10:33.946 --> 10:35.262
Y'all need
to stop trippin'.

10:37.646 --> 10:38.872
Let's just focus on...

10:39.748 --> 10:40.571
Selmont.

10:40.868 --> 10:41.430
We good?

10:41.627 --> 10:42.151
Yeah.

10:42.606 --> 10:43.492
Here's the schedule.

10:43.548 --> 10:45.171
3:45, let's have
everyone out there.

10:45.277 --> 10:46.333
All right.

10:47.688 --> 10:48.581
Thanks, Crowley.

10:48.698 --> 10:49.672
I appreciate the help.

10:49.766 --> 10:50.443
You bet.

10:52.975 --> 10:54.550
Guess I missed the memo
about the meeting.

10:55.478 --> 10:56.702
Oh, it was a defensive thing.

10:57.035 --> 10:58.343
Crowley wasn't defense.

10:58.707 --> 11:00.691
Yeah, but Crowley 
brought the pork rinds.

11:03.338 --> 11:04.700
Tell you what,
I'm not real comfortable

11:04.755 --> 11:05.821
about these secret meetings.

11:05.866 --> 11:08.062
I have a meeting with whoever
I want whenever I want

11:08.415 --> 11:09.911
whether it fits
your comfort zone or not.

11:09.927 --> 11:10.712
I don't care.

11:11.015 --> 11:13.251
Yeah, I think I'm entitled to know
what's going on with this team here.

11:13.678 --> 11:15.870
I think it was
just about the damn stupidest

11:15.915 --> 11:18.171
thing  you could have possibly
done running around saying,

11:18.218 --> 11:20.320
"Blacks this, whites that."

11:20.466 --> 11:21.751
And I apologized!

11:21.906 --> 11:23.200
I did your song and dance!

11:23.245 --> 11:24.491
You know what?
The only thing wrong

11:24.606 --> 11:25.910
with your apology, Mac,

11:26.468 --> 11:29.072
was it didn't look like
you believed your own apology.

11:31.185 --> 11:32.121
You know people out there

11:32.188 --> 11:33.770
are calling you a racist,
right now, don't you?

11:33.827 --> 11:35.821
- That doesn't scare you?
- Doesn't scare me at all.

11:35.895 --> 11:37.410
Well, it should!
You know why?

11:37.727 --> 11:38.663
'Cause you wanna know
what's sitting

11:38.717 --> 11:40.102
on this table right now?

11:40.838 --> 11:42.462
Your termination, that's what.

11:56.458 --> 11:57.521
You know what, Matt?

11:57.565 --> 11:58.570
Tyra was right

11:58.695 --> 12:00.600
about the whole
mixed tape thing.

12:00.627 --> 12:01.893
That was really, really lame.

12:01.905 --> 12:02.851
That was your idea.

12:02.987 --> 12:04.762
Right, but we both knew

12:04.778 --> 12:06.442
the risks involved
with mixed tapes.

12:06.538 --> 12:07.931
They're kind of
an acquired taste.

12:08.226 --> 12:09.562
Actually, come to think of it,

12:09.916 --> 12:11.382
I'm not really the one that

12:11.435 --> 12:12.752
cheated on Julie Taylor.

12:12.786 --> 12:14.063
I didn't cheat, okay?

12:14.095 --> 12:15.180
Whose side are you on anyway?

12:15.207 --> 12:16.781
I thought you were my friend.

12:16.807 --> 12:18.122
You know Tyra and I,

12:18.208 --> 12:20.152
we're just trying, you know,
to explain to you

12:20.195 --> 12:21.462
that you can't
just go around--

12:21.488 --> 12:22.562
Tyra and I.

12:23.077 --> 12:25.800
You really think that
there's any chance in hell

12:26.045 --> 12:27.441
that she'll ever even have

12:27.468 --> 12:28.480
a conversation with you?

12:28.517 --> 12:29.950
Stop right now
before you say something

12:29.976 --> 12:31.113
that you may
one day regret.

12:31.716 --> 12:32.931
Because I can tell you one thing,

12:32.937 --> 12:34.232
stranger things have
happened, Matt

12:34.248 --> 12:36.822
- Stranger things have not happened.
- I felt something with her.

12:37.067 --> 12:38.392
You don't--don't--

12:38.425 --> 12:39.722
I bet you felt something.

12:39.777 --> 12:41.250
Can I help y'all find something?

12:41.705 --> 12:43.232
Okay, he messed up.

12:43.537 --> 12:45.591
Well, how bad
did you mess up?

12:45.815 --> 12:46.672
Diamond bad?

12:46.795 --> 12:48.223
- Gold bad?
- Diamonds.

12:48.375 --> 12:49.440
What about this one
right here?

12:49.447 --> 12:50.423
How much is
this one right here?

12:50.458 --> 12:51.363
This little marquee?

12:51.397 --> 12:53.330
It wasn't diamond bad.

12:53.407 --> 12:54.170
I'm telling you,

12:54.357 --> 12:55.600
three girls
in a hot tub

12:55.688 --> 12:57.810
definitely qualifies
as diamond territory.

12:57.857 --> 12:59.710
Just reach into those
Alamo Freeze pockets of yours--

12:59.727 --> 13:01.721
Landry,
I got like $50, okay?

13:03.018 --> 13:04.320
Huh, how much
is that?

13:04.367 --> 13:06.440
This ring's $995.

13:07.207 --> 13:08.152
You know what?
Diamonds are stupid.

13:08.187 --> 13:09.371
Think about the Africans.

13:09.617 --> 13:10.752
You know, blood diamonds.

13:10.917 --> 13:12.550
How about a nice pendant
or some earrings?

13:12.606 --> 13:13.260
Think about that?

13:14.295 --> 13:15.753
- This one?
- Yeah, yeah. This.

13:15.908 --> 13:17.472
It's a little
heart-shaped amethyst.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.243
Right, and that's February,
right?

13:19.275 --> 13:20.893
Um-hmm, is her birthday
in February?

13:20.897 --> 13:21.653
It is.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.850
Well, then, you see, she'll know
you remembered her birthday.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.162
And how much is the amethyst?

13:26.225 --> 13:28.363
Let's see, it was $100.

13:28.585 --> 13:30.252
But it's half price,
so $50.

13:30.887 --> 13:32.060
How much do you have, Matt?

13:32.268 --> 13:33.521
You have $50.

13:35.298 --> 13:36.003
Take it.

13:36.487 --> 13:37.830
Yeah, let's--

13:37.888 --> 13:39.210
I'm gonna take that, please.

13:39.295 --> 13:40.221
Okay.

13:42.527 --> 13:43.422
Hey, guys.

13:43.818 --> 13:44.382
Coach.

13:47.038 --> 13:47.972
Hello, Mike.

13:48.008 --> 13:48.693
Hey, Buddy.

13:49.765 --> 13:50.520
How you doin'?

13:51.358 --> 13:53.061
You know, I've been better.
I've been worse.

13:53.125 --> 13:55.081
Well, whatever happens,

13:56.918 --> 13:58.023
it's gonna work out.

14:06.757 --> 14:07.490
Hey, Buddy.

14:07.588 --> 14:08.281
Eric.

14:11.837 --> 14:14.201
Those safeties
are as big as our tackles.

14:14.696 --> 14:17.073
Run stunts, cross block
every chance we get.

14:17.138 --> 14:18.271
Work the angles.

14:18.326 --> 14:20.082
Yeah, well,
how you gonna protect Saracen?

14:21.105 --> 14:23.442
Just roll 'em out of the pocket.
Have him throw short.

14:23.595 --> 14:24.903
Well, who's he gonna
throw it to, Eric?

14:24.955 --> 14:26.622
I thought you said
on the phone that you had

14:26.677 --> 14:28.210
some constructive advice.

14:31.015 --> 14:32.891
We cannot win
this football game

14:33.038 --> 14:35.262
without Smash
and the other guys.

14:35.568 --> 14:36.553
You know that.

14:37.586 --> 14:39.040
The booster club took a vote,

14:39.818 --> 14:42.151
and I can't think
of any ideas right now.

14:42.196 --> 14:44.402
So, you're gonna have
to get rid of Mac.

14:44.925 --> 14:45.992
That's what they voted.

14:46.586 --> 14:47.313
So do it.

14:47.656 --> 14:48.512
Get rid of him.

14:49.448 --> 14:50.633
How long you
and him been friends?

14:50.648 --> 14:51.963
What?
20, 30 years?

14:52.135 --> 14:53.240
Let me tell you something,

14:53.705 --> 14:55.310
we wouldn't be
where we are right now

14:55.406 --> 14:56.620
if it weren't for Mac McGill.

14:57.257 --> 14:58.683
You know as well as I do,

14:59.478 --> 15:01.241
Mac McGill is Panther football.

15:01.388 --> 15:02.751
You don't think I know that?

15:03.805 --> 15:06.750
I know he's not a racist.
This is media crap.

15:06.815 --> 15:08.132
But you know what?

15:08.227 --> 15:10.570
We got a team.
And we got one man,

15:11.305 --> 15:13.290
and he'll sacrifice for the team.

15:14.297 --> 15:16.412
So go ahead and do it.
Just get rid of him.

15:16.808 --> 15:17.992
We'll fix it later.

15:31.706 --> 15:32.953
I'm good at math.

15:33.347 --> 15:34.073
Hey, honey.

15:34.578 --> 15:35.260
Hi.

15:35.398 --> 15:36.723
I got a guidance
counselor emergency.

15:36.968 --> 15:38.690
Well, I'm talking
to Carrie here.

15:38.706 --> 15:40.112
We're just gonna be
finished up here--

15:40.165 --> 15:41.501
I got a guidance
counselor emergency.

15:42.088 --> 15:43.902
- You want me to leave?
- Yes.

15:44.556 --> 15:45.451
Really?

15:45.578 --> 15:46.203
Yeah.

15:46.858 --> 15:47.650
Thank you.

15:48.465 --> 15:50.090
We'll just be one second.
One quick second.

15:50.188 --> 15:51.202
Right where we left off.

15:52.568 --> 15:53.302
Listen to me,

15:53.566 --> 15:55.260
everything hangs
in the balance right here.

15:55.348 --> 15:57.473
I've got a question, and I need
some advice from you.

15:57.568 --> 15:58.302
All right.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.051
I need to talk
to the guidance counselor,

16:00.076 --> 16:00.723
not my wife.

16:00.757 --> 16:01.940
I need some unbiased,

16:02.035 --> 16:03.940
clear, honest advice.

16:04.206 --> 16:05.590
Everything hangs in the balance.

16:05.667 --> 16:06.663
All right.
Sit down.

16:06.788 --> 16:07.890
Come on, sit down.

16:08.458 --> 16:09.130
Sit down.

16:12.687 --> 16:15.610
The Boosters and Buddy
want me to fire Mac McGill.

16:15.658 --> 16:17.030
I don't wanna fire Mac McGill.

16:17.646 --> 16:19.372
Mac McGill's a damn good coach.

16:19.507 --> 16:22.260
And Mac McGill is
important for me

16:22.437 --> 16:23.610
in the playoffs.

16:24.887 --> 16:26.670
I thought this was gonna end
a while ago.

16:26.738 --> 16:29.190
I didn't think it would go on
as far as it did. I was wrong.

16:29.625 --> 16:30.541
So what's the question?

16:30.907 --> 16:32.882
The question is what do I do
about firing Mac McGill?

16:34.118 --> 16:35.012
What did he say?

16:35.877 --> 16:36.822
Honey, you heard
what he said--

16:36.836 --> 16:38.720
I know what he said.
I wanna review.

16:38.795 --> 16:40.320
Let's review.
Let's review the events.

16:42.218 --> 16:43.560
About Smash Williams, he said,

16:43.726 --> 16:45.720
the black players have a gift
for running the ball.

16:45.837 --> 16:46.973
- That they're fearless.
- Right.

16:47.025 --> 16:48.010
Fearless, they got a gift.

16:48.095 --> 16:49.502
Wasn't there something else
in that little phrase?

16:49.528 --> 16:51.280
And he said a thing
about the junkyard dog thing.

16:51.455 --> 16:53.470
As far as the players,
like Matt Saracen--

16:53.746 --> 16:55.083
You mean your white players.

16:55.137 --> 16:57.302
Yes, the white pl-- he said
they don't have the physicality.

16:58.977 --> 16:59.890
But he said they have

17:00.046 --> 17:01.323
more creative thinking,

17:01.378 --> 17:02.721
which makes them
well-suited to lead.

17:02.758 --> 17:04.271
That's what he said.
It was a stupid thing to say.

17:04.278 --> 17:05.941
- I understand.
- As a guidance counselor

17:05.955 --> 17:07.053
I gotta say that that,

17:07.157 --> 17:08.631
to me, is a fireable offense.

17:08.837 --> 17:10.090
What he said.

17:11.626 --> 17:12.833
All right, well,
let me talk to my wife.

17:12.935 --> 17:14.192
Let me talk to the person
who cares about me

17:14.217 --> 17:15.252
and cares about the team.

17:15.406 --> 17:16.670
And also has to understand

17:16.705 --> 17:18.012
the relevance
and the importance

17:18.038 --> 17:18.942
to our future

17:19.297 --> 17:20.983
of us winning the regional.

17:21.188 --> 17:22.849
There is nothing more
clear to me

17:22.907 --> 17:24.143
that your team

17:24.268 --> 17:26.133
is way more important
to you than Mac McGill.

17:29.467 --> 17:30.831
Is there anyone else
I can talk to?

17:31.585 --> 17:32.871
You can talk to your friend.

17:33.158 --> 17:34.301
What does
she have to say?

17:34.476 --> 17:35.803
This is not
about Mac McGill.

17:35.806 --> 17:37.330
It's not about the team.
This is about you.

17:37.627 --> 17:39.022
And you've been put
in this position now

17:39.048 --> 17:40.451
where you've got
to make the decision.

17:40.598 --> 17:42.331
If you don't fire him
at this point,

17:42.607 --> 17:44.071
you are condoning
what he said.

17:44.126 --> 17:45.512
Honey, he said something stupid.

17:45.515 --> 17:46.710
- He's not a racist.
- I know.

17:46.756 --> 17:47.550
He's a friend.

17:47.758 --> 17:50.551
But that is not something
for a kids' assistant coach to say,

17:50.668 --> 17:52.892
no less for a government
employee,

17:53.066 --> 17:54.353
which is what he is.

18:01.348 --> 18:02.530
The three of you scare me.

18:03.085 --> 18:03.891
I know.

18:04.326 --> 18:05.192
Here, come on.

18:05.575 --> 18:06.510
She's ready for you.

18:06.925 --> 18:09.582
On one side I got Rig and all
them dudes hating on me.

18:09.977 --> 18:11.863
And on the other side
I got Seale and everybody

18:11.876 --> 18:13.681
looking at me like I'm
the key to they future.

18:14.518 --> 18:15.531
I'm beginning to wonder if I

18:15.556 --> 18:16.702
should have walked off at all.

18:17.428 --> 18:19.342
No, you stood up
for what you believe in.

18:19.398 --> 18:21.152
And baby, that takes guts.

18:21.437 --> 18:23.572
Yeah, but what if it
don't work, Angela Davis?

18:23.907 --> 18:25.242
You ain't
gotta worry about that.

18:25.287 --> 18:26.211
That's what they want,

18:26.297 --> 18:27.603
for you to doubt yourself.

18:28.625 --> 18:29.823
Think about
what I could be losing.

18:30.415 --> 18:32.002
Think about what
you're not losing,

18:32.085 --> 18:34.113
like your rights
and your integrity.

18:34.706 --> 18:37.583
You could do so much more
with your life besides football.

18:38.836 --> 18:39.942
I don't know
about all that.

18:40.765 --> 18:41.980
Well, you don't have
to worry about it

18:42.026 --> 18:43.823
because Mac McGill
is gonna get fired.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.093
Yeah, how do you know?

18:45.735 --> 18:46.681
'Cause

18:47.917 --> 18:49.232
even I know
that the Panthers

18:49.287 --> 18:50.911
can't win without you guys.

18:51.186 --> 18:52.190
Yeah, well,

18:53.115 --> 18:54.212
you right about that.

18:54.837 --> 18:56.360
I'm sorry, what'd you say?
I'm what?

18:57.586 --> 18:58.782
Now, don't let it go
to your head.

19:03.195 --> 19:03.812
I'll get it.

19:03.898 --> 19:04.542
Thanks.

19:10.298 --> 19:11.521
I'm, uh, sorry
to bother ya.

19:11.726 --> 19:12.563
Is the coach here?

19:12.996 --> 19:14.191
Yeah, Mac.
Come on in.

19:14.267 --> 19:15.140
Get out of the cold.

19:16.218 --> 19:17.172
He's right back there.

19:19.086 --> 19:20.713
My dad wasn't a bad man.
You know?

19:22.558 --> 19:24.203
He had a couple real passions
in his life.

19:24.257 --> 19:25.452
He loved to bass fish,

19:25.477 --> 19:27.172
and he loved Razorback football.

19:28.586 --> 19:30.051
I remember one time
when those

19:30.668 --> 19:32.780
poor girls tried to integrate
Central down in Little Rock.

19:32.868 --> 19:33.371
Well

19:33.888 --> 19:35.242
My dad was pissed.

19:36.526 --> 19:38.862
He'd have gone down there
with his Kiwanis boys probably,

19:39.848 --> 19:41.912
done no-telling-what
if my mama hadn't stopped him.

19:42.737 --> 19:44.241
Well, it's different times.

19:46.117 --> 19:47.863
I didn't agree with it
or anything.

19:48.647 --> 19:50.253
I never thought it was
the right thing to do.

19:50.286 --> 19:50.622
But

19:51.405 --> 19:53.192
stuff like this kinda
works its way into you

19:53.237 --> 19:54.581
if you're around it
long enough, you know?

19:58.008 --> 19:59.573
Mac, I know one damn thing
for sure.

19:59.597 --> 20:01.613
You're the one
that integrated this team.

20:03.445 --> 20:05.211
Look, I'm a simple man, Eric.

20:06.656 --> 20:07.701
I love my girls.

20:09.186 --> 20:10.412
I love working
in my yard.

20:11.048 --> 20:13.230
I love playing bridge
with Susan every chance I get.

20:13.286 --> 20:13.602
But

20:14.426 --> 20:16.191
I know that I screwed
this up here.

20:17.668 --> 20:20.122
Truth is, I'm still trying
to get used to a man

20:20.606 --> 20:22.630
that's ten years my junior
sitting in a seat

20:23.327 --> 20:25.091
that I thought would be mine
one of these days.

20:25.885 --> 20:27.573
And I know
that I handled that wrong.

20:28.865 --> 20:29.883
And I'm sorry.

20:32.287 --> 20:33.502
I love these boys.

20:34.726 --> 20:35.692
I love this team,

20:36.156 --> 20:38.023
and I'm not gonna do anything
to stand in the way of it.

20:38.086 --> 20:39.581
I'm not gonna do anything
to hurt it.

20:41.156 --> 20:43.313
I know y'all got a real
good chance to go to state.

20:44.055 --> 20:45.721
- What are you doing?
- My resignation.

20:45.785 --> 20:47.351
Aw, come on.
What the hell you doing?

20:47.455 --> 20:48.670
It's too hard as it is.

20:49.535 --> 20:50.741
Thanks for the beer.

21:00.876 --> 21:01.943
Thinking about Mac?

21:04.937 --> 21:05.501
Yeah.

21:05.775 --> 21:06.961
Seems like it'll be easier
for you

21:07.038 --> 21:08.971
now that he's turned in his
resignation, don't you think?

21:09.175 --> 21:10.213
I know what's easy.

21:10.628 --> 21:11.691
And I know what's right.

21:12.585 --> 21:14.091
The guy's given up 20 years

21:14.157 --> 21:14.803
of his life

21:15.097 --> 21:16.122
for that program.

21:16.337 --> 21:17.230
And yet he's willing

21:17.267 --> 21:18.162
to sacrifice his ego

21:18.215 --> 21:19.403
and half his damn pension.

21:21.818 --> 21:23.470
But I still have
to do what's right.

21:24.645 --> 21:25.252
Right?

21:25.385 --> 21:25.952
Right.

21:32.855 --> 21:34.440
Coach! Coach! Coach!

21:36.688 --> 21:38.452
I'll start talking
when y'all stop.

21:40.316 --> 21:42.583
First of all, it's a damn shame
that we're here this morning.

21:43.365 --> 21:45.463
We should be focusing
on tomorrow's game.

21:45.955 --> 21:47.242
And I'll tell you what.
That's exactly

21:47.277 --> 21:49.033
what we're gonna do
'cause Mac McGill is gonna stay

21:49.046 --> 21:50.781
as offensive coordinator
of the Dillon Panthers.

21:50.825 --> 21:52.082
That's it.
Thank you very much.

21:59.138 --> 22:00.411
So I guess
this is it, huh?

22:02.188 --> 22:03.031
I guess so.

22:04.215 --> 22:05.281
You're really
gonna do it?

22:05.356 --> 22:06.292
You're not gonna play?

22:07.207 --> 22:07.743
Nope.

22:08.278 --> 22:09.343
All right,
if you need to hear it,

22:09.346 --> 22:10.293
I'll say it, Williams.

22:11.446 --> 22:12.522
We need you, man.

22:12.657 --> 22:13.770
We need our leader back.

22:14.368 --> 22:15.372
You know this.

22:16.358 --> 22:17.533
This team needs all of us.

22:19.195 --> 22:21.172
As far as a leader goes,
why don't you look in the mirror?

22:22.677 --> 22:24.281
You and I both know
I'm not a leader.

22:25.616 --> 22:27.462
Didn't you hear anything
Mac McGill said, Rig?

22:28.228 --> 22:29.010
You're white.

22:29.567 --> 22:30.771
That means
you were born a leader.

22:31.128 --> 22:31.793
All right.

22:37.465 --> 22:38.030
All right.

22:38.468 --> 22:39.112
That's everything.

22:40.587 --> 22:41.733
- Baby, it's only two weeks.
- I know

22:41.845 --> 22:43.240
I know, I know.

22:44.246 --> 22:45.513
Why can't I take you again?

22:45.555 --> 22:46.661
Because it's really

22:46.718 --> 22:48.130
far out of the way, and I
don't want you driving at night.

22:48.177 --> 22:48.813
And, uh,

22:48.946 --> 22:50.661
it's a really big deal.

22:51.118 --> 22:52.363
I just gotta focus.

22:52.906 --> 22:54.511
Gotta get my head into it.

22:59.477 --> 23:00.360
Let's go.

23:02.605 --> 23:03.710
So you'll call me
when you get there?

23:03.768 --> 23:04.383
Promise.

23:05.148 --> 23:06.361
I'll call you every day,
okay?

23:08.748 --> 23:09.430
Hey, whoa!

23:09.748 --> 23:11.172
Oh, did I do that?

23:11.287 --> 23:13.180
We gotta make like time
and cruise, huh?

23:13.285 --> 23:15.963
I got several disreputable women
waiting for me in Austin.

23:17.325 --> 23:18.623
- I love you.
- Catch you later, Miss Lyla.

23:18.626 --> 23:19.253
I love you too.

23:19.888 --> 23:21.020
What the hell is wrong
with you?

23:29.856 --> 23:31.840
Hey,
what time is the movie at?

23:32.528 --> 23:33.252
I think it's, like,

23:33.607 --> 23:35.693
seven-ish or something.

23:35.996 --> 23:37.682
You mind if we make a stop
at the, uh,

23:37.846 --> 23:39.632
women with low
self-esteem palace?

23:40.148 --> 23:41.792
My sister owes me
a bunch of cash.

23:43.217 --> 23:44.752
Yeah, sure.
That's cool.

23:55.015 --> 23:57.113
That son of a bitch grabs
my ass one more time,

23:57.117 --> 23:58.403
I swear I'm gonna kick him
in the head.

23:58.655 --> 23:59.433
Excuse me, honey.

24:09.478 --> 24:11.331
Okay, so it's Landry again,

24:11.377 --> 24:14.051
which means it's Matt and
it's the third time he's called.

24:14.406 --> 24:16.073
All right, honey.
You gotta wait till the fifth call.

24:16.468 --> 24:17.811
- Tyra.
- What?

24:17.876 --> 24:18.832
I do like him.

24:19.996 --> 24:21.990
Fine. Go head.
Answer it.

24:22.298 --> 24:23.470
Do whatever you want.

24:24.057 --> 24:24.773
Hello?

24:25.136 --> 24:26.531
Uh, hey. Hi.

24:27.495 --> 24:28.223
Um,

24:29.156 --> 24:30.793
look, I really, uh...

24:31.125 --> 24:32.603
I really need to talk to you...

24:32.787 --> 24:33.783
in person.

24:34.187 --> 24:36.363
Amber, did you take
my baby oil again?

24:37.445 --> 24:38.540
Where are you?

24:38.945 --> 24:41.852
Uh, I'm at the Landing Strip.

24:42.298 --> 24:44.332
Uh, it's that strip club.

24:44.635 --> 24:45.901
Tyra had to pick up something
from her sister.

24:45.908 --> 24:46.900
What did she just say?

24:47.676 --> 24:49.142
She said Landing Strip?

24:49.827 --> 24:51.520
Look, can I just come by

24:51.535 --> 24:53.860
and meet you?
'Cause I really need to talk to you.

24:56.415 --> 24:56.983
Okay.

24:57.685 --> 24:59.121
This Mac McGill mess?

24:59.375 --> 25:00.690
It's over. It's done.
You hear me?

25:01.138 --> 25:02.470
No, no,
it can't be done.

25:02.977 --> 25:04.161
I started all this.

25:05.286 --> 25:07.061
I'm up to my neck in it,
but it's my fight.

25:07.518 --> 25:09.163
Plus, everybody taken
their cues all from me.

25:09.865 --> 25:11.391
Look, I gotta stand firm
and be their leader.

25:11.908 --> 25:13.563
You quitting football

25:13.668 --> 25:15.582
to try and make a
point about racism

25:15.618 --> 25:16.973
in a small Texas town,

25:17.076 --> 25:18.820
that ain't
the million-man march.

25:19.036 --> 25:20.631
You are 17, and you got

25:20.665 --> 25:22.003
a brilliant future ahead of you.

25:22.008 --> 25:24.250
And I'm not gonna sit here
and watch you throw it away

25:24.316 --> 25:26.983
trying to teach a lesson
to a bunch of fools.

25:28.476 --> 25:31.062
You know how you get back at people
that think like Mac McGill?

25:32.006 --> 25:33.362
You get back
on that team.

25:34.098 --> 25:36.222
You play like the star
that you are.

25:36.667 --> 25:39.211
And you get recruited
by an A-list university.

25:39.918 --> 25:41.851
Go on and get your degree.

25:43.116 --> 25:44.181
Now you get up from here,

25:44.315 --> 25:45.313
get you something to eat,

25:45.588 --> 25:48.302
and get your butt into bed 'cause
you going to that game tomorrow.

25:49.188 --> 25:50.970
What about everybody who said
they weren't gonna play?

25:51.636 --> 25:52.792
You a leader, honey.

25:53.396 --> 25:54.301
They'll follow you.

26:04.956 --> 26:06.082
Ok, Matt, first off,

26:06.728 --> 26:09.031
you gotta act like you been
to just a million strip clubs.

26:09.077 --> 26:11.412
Like, see, her? Like, naked ladies?
That's no big deal.

26:11.696 --> 26:12.582
Look, Landry.

26:12.586 --> 26:13.653
I just wanna get in here

26:13.658 --> 26:14.540
and then get outta here.

26:14.795 --> 26:15.531
And secondly,

26:16.716 --> 26:17.182
look 'em in the eyes,

26:17.218 --> 26:19.583
not in the rack.
That's a huge mistake.

26:20.978 --> 26:21.593
Hey.

26:21.685 --> 26:22.851
Uh, hey.

26:24.235 --> 26:24.940
Hey, Tyra.

26:25.096 --> 26:26.070
How's it going?

26:27.636 --> 26:28.040
What?

26:28.125 --> 26:29.550
Just wondering if I could maybe
buy you a drink.

26:29.736 --> 26:31.393
- Strawberry Daiquiri, or--
- No.

26:33.878 --> 26:34.753
Took you long enough.

26:35.248 --> 26:36.703
What, every song have
to be a ballad?

26:38.275 --> 26:40.190
What'd I tell you about
bringing your friends in here?

26:41.348 --> 26:43.043
Excuse me.
I'm sorry about this.

26:43.107 --> 26:44.353
Could I get some singles?

26:44.415 --> 26:45.751
What do you want singles for?

26:46.285 --> 26:47.670
I mean, for tips, Matt.

26:47.695 --> 26:50.123
These women are out here
working hard.  Right?

26:50.178 --> 26:52.431
Were you just--
Were you born in a barn, Matt?

26:52.475 --> 26:53.612
Okay, just go.
Just go.

26:53.716 --> 26:54.832
You want any nachos?

26:55.107 --> 26:56.453
- No.
- They're two bucks.

27:01.146 --> 27:01.812
All right, look.

27:01.828 --> 27:03.413
I got a lot of stuff

27:03.457 --> 27:04.892
that I really wanna talk
to you about.

27:04.918 --> 27:06.932
I know, and I wanna
talk to you too.

27:07.925 --> 27:08.593
Good.

27:08.766 --> 27:11.001
'Cause there's something
I really wanna give you.

27:11.026 --> 27:12.642
- And it's kinda--
- Can we just wait?

27:12.845 --> 27:14.751
It's just kinda gross
and depressing here.

27:14.776 --> 27:15.480
All right, y'all.

27:15.635 --> 27:16.501
I'm ready to go.

27:16.787 --> 27:17.470
You done?

27:17.678 --> 27:18.700
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

27:19.865 --> 27:21.350
Wait.
Where's the other one?

27:36.867 --> 27:38.263
Have I seen you here before?

27:38.266 --> 27:38.800
Maybe.

27:40.915 --> 27:42.212
I'm Agent Thomas.

27:42.786 --> 27:44.083
Do you have I.D. on you?

27:50.237 --> 27:51.222
Tyra Collette,

27:51.358 --> 27:52.460
Landry Clarke,

27:52.556 --> 27:53.542
Matt Saracen.

27:53.667 --> 27:54.532
Your parents are here.

27:54.615 --> 27:55.683
Wait, my grandma's here?

27:55.876 --> 27:57.153
Mr. and Mrs. Clarke
vouched for you.

27:57.188 --> 27:58.060
They'll take you home.

27:58.565 --> 27:59.632
But what about me?

27:59.735 --> 28:00.502
Just these three.

28:00.538 --> 28:01.041
Let's go!

28:01.067 --> 28:02.250
Then I'll just wait here.

28:02.305 --> 28:03.131
Not an option!

28:03.168 --> 28:04.163
Let's go--move it!

28:04.768 --> 28:06.473
Thank you
for your expediency.

28:07.396 --> 28:08.700
Just go.
I'll be fine.

28:08.795 --> 28:09.633
Will you call me later?

28:09.756 --> 28:11.173
- Move, people! Let's go!
- I'll call you.

28:25.218 --> 28:26.403
How long
we gonna sit out here?

28:26.416 --> 28:27.033
A little bit longer.

28:27.065 --> 28:28.650
All the other parents
have picked up their perps.

28:28.697 --> 28:29.862
Why can't we pick up ours?

28:29.905 --> 28:31.600
Because I would like our perp
to sit in there and think

28:31.655 --> 28:33.881
for a minute about what
she's doing sitting in there.

28:45.697 --> 28:47.800
Look, any time you guys
wanna say something, that'd be great.

28:47.895 --> 28:49.790
Oh, really? Is that the way
you wanna start the conversation?

28:49.837 --> 28:51.042
You really wanna know
what I have to say?

28:51.076 --> 28:52.222
You're grounded,
for starters.

28:52.328 --> 28:53.063
Fine.
Whatever.

28:53.938 --> 28:55.061
"Fine. Whatever"?

28:55.556 --> 28:57.752
What the hell were you doing
at a strip club, Julie?

28:57.915 --> 28:58.912
We were waiting
for Mindy.

28:58.995 --> 29:00.140
You were waiting
for Mindy.

29:00.297 --> 29:01.601
- Tyra's sister.
- Tyra's sister?

29:01.615 --> 29:02.891
- She works there.
- Of course it's Tyra's sister.

29:02.957 --> 29:03.943
Of course she works there.

29:03.946 --> 29:04.970
You are so totally
judgmental

29:04.997 --> 29:06.070
about anything to do
with Tyra.

29:06.105 --> 29:07.432
Yeah, you know what?
I am judgmental.

29:07.557 --> 29:08.763
I am judgmental about a woman

29:08.795 --> 29:10.181
who takes her clothes off
for a living.

29:10.388 --> 29:12.101
And as a result,
my daughter is not allowed

29:12.177 --> 29:12.982
to hang out in strip clubs.

29:13.015 --> 29:14.523
No, we weren't hanging out
at the strip club!

29:14.567 --> 29:16.451
Tyra had to go get money
that Mindy owed her.

29:16.528 --> 29:18.620
Honey, do you have anything
to say about this situation?

29:18.695 --> 29:20.953
Yeah, first of all,
it's important that you're okay.

29:21.097 --> 29:23.063
She's not okay!
She just spent

29:23.106 --> 29:25.152
the entire evening
watching Mindy

29:25.216 --> 29:26.231
make an honest living--

29:26.257 --> 29:27.450
All right, then!
You talk to her!

29:27.476 --> 29:28.081
She's not okay, Eric!

29:28.097 --> 29:29.120
I told you what happened.

29:29.146 --> 29:30.732
And we were hanging out
at the strip club.

29:30.755 --> 29:32.152
But you're too busy looking down

29:32.195 --> 29:33.260
from your ivory tower

29:33.285 --> 29:33.913
at Tyra's family.

29:33.925 --> 29:34.881
You wanna see what it looks like
from my ivory tower?!

29:34.938 --> 29:36.342
From my ivory tower, girl,

29:36.377 --> 29:38.452
you're not hanging out
with Tyra Collette anymore!

29:38.518 --> 29:39.892
You can't punish me
like that.

29:39.978 --> 29:41.022
That is not a punishment.
That is a rule.

29:41.027 --> 29:41.860
Whatever.
You know what, good night.

29:42.258 --> 29:43.301
"Whatever"?

29:45.487 --> 29:46.522
Nice input.

29:55.338 --> 29:56.841
Make sure you got your bags.

29:57.166 --> 29:58.353
Everybody get your bags.

30:05.288 --> 30:06.271
Honey.

30:07.316 --> 30:08.271
Turn around.

30:09.128 --> 30:09.820
Turn around.

30:40.517 --> 30:41.660
Got any more room
on that bus?

31:00.015 --> 31:01.411
- Listen, son--
- No, you listen.

31:01.885 --> 31:03.451
I'm here,
but that don't change a thing.

31:05.297 --> 31:06.372
I know who you are.

31:53.775 --> 31:55.921
Welcome to Dunston Valley, Folks.

31:56.207 --> 31:57.943
The second round of the Texas

31:58.306 --> 32:00.302
High School
Championship play-offs.

32:01.076 --> 32:03.923
These Cardinals were not
expecting Smash Williams

32:04.018 --> 32:06.423
and the other Dillon players
that have gone MIA

32:06.455 --> 32:07.721
to be here tonight.

32:07.808 --> 32:09.261
But here they are.

32:09.737 --> 32:10.991
These Dunston Valley guys

32:11.015 --> 32:13.370
have a nasty reputation
for getting it done

32:13.416 --> 32:14.370
any way they can.

32:14.386 --> 32:15.583
Hey, Williams.
You made it.

32:15.866 --> 32:17.172
You're gonna wish
you stayed home.

32:17.245 --> 32:19.812
We gonna see about that.
We gonna see about that.

32:21.347 --> 32:22.510
Come on, 7. Come on.

32:22.566 --> 32:23.723
Come on, baby!

32:23.967 --> 32:25.060
All right, gentlemen.

32:25.096 --> 32:26.183
Listen up, listen up!

32:26.228 --> 32:27.180
Let's take it right to 'em.

32:27.217 --> 32:28.520
Let's a have
a good clean game now.

32:28.567 --> 32:29.872
Let's have some fun.
What do you say?

32:44.586 --> 32:45.890
Set!

32:46.006 --> 32:47.691
Green, 20!

32:47.845 --> 32:49.802
Green...20!
Hut!

32:51.556 --> 32:52.920
Smash cuts through the defense

32:52.947 --> 32:54.012
to run up the middle.

32:54.708 --> 32:56.171
Oh! And a big hit.

33:00.715 --> 33:03.072
Oh, man! We knew this was
gonna be a physical game,

33:03.147 --> 33:05.883
and the Cardinals aren't
wasting any time

33:05.907 --> 33:07.000
bringing the smack.

33:07.125 --> 33:08.901
They are getting it on
right now.

33:09.466 --> 33:11.393
The Panthers though
are no stranger

33:11.426 --> 33:12.810
to hard-hitting
and head-knocking, folks.

33:12.858 --> 33:13.863
I'll tell you that.

33:14.488 --> 33:15.753
Black, ten!

33:15.925 --> 33:16.630
Hut!

33:16.848 --> 33:18.572
Saracen opens to his left.

33:18.775 --> 33:20.401
It's a swing pass to Smash.

33:23.197 --> 33:25.110
The 40, the 35!

33:27.976 --> 33:29.950
And it is touchdown!
Williams!

33:30.098 --> 33:32.183
Touchdown, Smash Williams.

33:32.278 --> 33:35.612
And just like that,
Dillon takes the lead.

33:36.485 --> 33:37.912
Put up or shut up,
baby!

33:37.978 --> 33:39.160
Put up or shut up!

33:40.616 --> 33:41.972
Defense!

33:42.375 --> 33:43.531
Defense!

33:43.966 --> 33:45.071
Defense!

33:45.376 --> 33:46.582
Defense!

33:46.985 --> 33:48.102
Defense!

33:48.436 --> 33:49.451
Defense!

33:49.847 --> 33:51.172
Tailback cuts off tackle.

33:51.426 --> 33:52.400
He cut's inside.

33:52.717 --> 33:54.411
Oh! And he goes down hard.

33:55.228 --> 33:56.590
We keep the clock running!

33:56.647 --> 33:57.661
We move the chains.

33:57.718 --> 33:58.931
That's all we gotta do.
Move the chains.

33:58.956 --> 33:59.821
Give it to Smash.

33:59.946 --> 34:01.062
He can run with the ball.

34:01.168 --> 34:02.450
All right?
Let's get it going?

34:06.098 --> 34:07.622
Touchdown! Touchdown!

34:07.805 --> 34:11.081
And Dunston Valley
ties this game up.

34:11.905 --> 34:12.940
Let's go to work, all right?

34:12.987 --> 34:14.020
Let's go to work!

34:14.987 --> 34:16.170
Saracen drops back.

34:16.397 --> 34:17.880
He's got Smash on the outside!

34:21.085 --> 34:22.663
- How can you not see that?!
- No foul.

34:22.715 --> 34:24.351
How can you not see that?!

34:24.567 --> 34:26.469
And that is another no-call.

34:26.514 --> 34:29.012
And the Panthers can't seem
to get a break tonight.

34:30.058 --> 34:31.523
Smash Williams
off to the left.

34:31.817 --> 34:33.972
He's got some space.
He picks up a nice block.

34:36.745 --> 34:38.603
Face mask! Face mask!

34:38.626 --> 34:39.902
How can you not see that?

34:39.906 --> 34:41.741
Off the field, Coach.
Off the field, Coach!

34:42.588 --> 34:43.920
How can you not know that?

34:44.058 --> 34:45.983
What you looking at?
Face mask!

34:46.036 --> 34:47.581
I've heard of letting
them play, folks,

34:47.606 --> 34:50.583
but this is starting
to get out of hand real fast.

34:50.746 --> 34:52.851
Come here! Smash! Smash!

34:53.076 --> 34:54.293
Smash, get over here!

34:54.366 --> 34:54.973
Get over here!

34:55.344 --> 34:56.842
Listen to me.
I see what's going on.

34:56.898 --> 34:58.991
Do not let them get in your head.
You understand me?

34:59.048 --> 34:59.511
Yes, sir.

34:59.546 --> 35:00.660
Play your own game.
Look at me.

35:00.716 --> 35:02.292
- Play your own game, son.
- Yes, sir.

35:02.326 --> 35:03.050
Get in there.

35:04.026 --> 35:04.942
Come on!
Let's go!

35:05.728 --> 35:06.943
Come on, Brian!

35:07.765 --> 35:08.910
Early in the fourth quarter.

35:08.947 --> 35:11.461
This has been
a real see-saw battle, folks.

35:11.508 --> 35:14.030
Dillon with the ball,
up by four,

35:14.125 --> 35:16.510
with a chance to put this thing
out of reach right now.

35:16.575 --> 35:18.162
Black, ten!
Hut!

35:19.366 --> 35:20.743
It's a drop play
to Smash.

35:20.876 --> 35:22.430
He's got some room
up the middle.

35:24.005 --> 35:25.510
Oh, he breaks a tackle!

35:25.805 --> 35:27.053
He's inside the ten!

35:27.155 --> 35:28.261
He's gonna score!

35:28.398 --> 35:30.901
Touchdown!
Touchdown Panthers!

35:31.607 --> 35:34.233
Oh!
And Smash is absolutely

35:34.287 --> 35:36.500
drilled in the in the end zone
in one of the latest

35:36.545 --> 35:38.010
hits I've ever seen.

35:38.187 --> 35:39.752
Oh, you like that?
You like that?

35:42.647 --> 35:43.912
Next time,
I'm gonna break you in half.

35:43.997 --> 35:45.623
You hear me,
you lazy-ass, tall baby?

35:45.696 --> 35:47.162
- Hey, what'd you say?
- You hear me say it once?

35:47.446 --> 35:48.421
You ain't got nothing!

35:48.586 --> 35:49.531
You ain't got nothing!

35:49.788 --> 35:52.282
Oh, Tim Riggins just leveled

35:52.377 --> 35:53.582
the Cardinal linebacker.

35:56.898 --> 35:59.020
Holy cow, this thing
is getting out of hand.

36:00.767 --> 36:03.352
And it's an all-out brawl
on the field.

36:30.497 --> 36:32.052
Jack Langer with
the athletic board.

36:32.115 --> 36:33.970
It's going crazy out there.
I'm calling the game.

36:34.097 --> 36:35.502
- Dillon wins.
- No!

36:35.578 --> 36:37.222
Coach, you don't go in there!
You stay!

36:37.306 --> 36:39.281
You stay and play!
You stay!

36:39.427 --> 36:40.560
Coach, coach!
I gave the call.

36:40.617 --> 36:42.043
No, we're playing this game!

36:42.097 --> 36:43.180
We're playing this game!

36:43.228 --> 36:44.393
This is our field!

36:44.446 --> 36:45.433
We're playing!

36:51.978 --> 36:53.582
This is not who we are.

36:53.945 --> 36:56.000
This is not what we represent.

36:56.426 --> 36:57.743
I don't teach that crap.

36:57.786 --> 36:59.632
These coaches don't teach
that crap.

36:59.977 --> 37:01.762
Y'all are gonna take
responsibility

37:01.837 --> 37:03.601
for your actions.
I guarantee it!

37:04.065 --> 37:06.082
Does that mean we're done?
Are we out of the play-offs?

37:06.408 --> 37:08.813
UIL considers
three full quarters

37:09.277 --> 37:10.523
a complete game.

37:11.025 --> 37:13.163
We were ahead at that time,
so we get the win.

37:13.475 --> 37:14.863
But that is no damn reason

37:14.908 --> 37:16.020
for celebration!

37:16.286 --> 37:19.033
So wipe those smiles
off your faces, dammit!

37:19.506 --> 37:21.352
What I want you to do
right now

37:21.708 --> 37:23.893
is I want you to gather up
your gear.

37:24.246 --> 37:25.391
There's no changing.

37:25.485 --> 37:26.543
Go get on the bus.

37:26.595 --> 37:27.783
We're getting the hell
outta here.

37:27.826 --> 37:29.010
Let's go.
Right now!

38:12.496 --> 38:14.183
All right, just sit down
and shut up.

38:14.267 --> 38:15.261
Calm down.

38:26.566 --> 38:27.512
What's the problem, Officer?

38:29.518 --> 38:31.871
I'm gonna need the two of you
to step in front of the bus here for me.

38:36.845 --> 38:37.841
Right over here, please.

38:38.197 --> 38:39.412
Nobody step foot
off this bus.

38:40.076 --> 38:40.992
What can we do for you?

38:41.348 --> 38:42.453
We're looking for one
of your players.

38:43.007 --> 38:43.722
One of my players?

38:43.978 --> 38:45.022
Smash Williams, Coach.

38:45.537 --> 38:46.611
There's a whole lot
of witness saying

38:46.635 --> 38:47.510
he threw the first punch.

38:47.595 --> 38:49.393
Now we got an aggravated
assault complaint,

38:49.696 --> 38:50.912
and we are bringing him in
for questioning.

38:50.938 --> 38:52.561
You're telling me that you're
gonna blame one of my players

38:52.617 --> 38:53.803
for what happened
on that field tonight?

38:53.837 --> 38:54.750
This is police business,
Coach.

38:54.775 --> 38:56.121
This ain't got noting to do
about football.

38:56.427 --> 38:57.512
Now you go on there

38:57.618 --> 38:58.872
and get that boy right now.

38:59.076 --> 39:01.231
Or we will go in there
and drag him out ourselves.

39:02.566 --> 39:03.572
It's your call.

39:06.937 --> 39:07.972
Well, here's my call.

39:08.137 --> 39:09.370
You got a warrant,
Officer?

39:10.688 --> 39:12.113
'Cause if you don't got
a warrant,

39:12.838 --> 39:15.060
we all know that you ain't
gonna get on this bus.

39:17.715 --> 39:19.592
- I can go get a warrant.
- That's fine.

39:22.067 --> 39:23.291
We got all night.

39:39.678 --> 39:41.141
We'll get you next year,
Coach.

40:04.638 --> 40:05.320
Let's go.

40:34.055 --> 40:35.260
10:00.
See ya at film.

40:37.947 --> 40:39.052
I'll be there, Coach.

40:52.997 --> 40:54.061
Hey, Mac.

40:56.618 --> 40:57.992
What happened back there
with those cops?

41:01.937 --> 41:03.210
They made a mistake, son...

41:03.738 --> 41:04.760
just like I did.

41:08.705 --> 41:10.323
I'll see you
at practice Monday.

41:35.635 --> 41:36.423
Can I, uh--

41:41.107 --> 41:41.983
It's, um--

41:43.138 --> 41:45.172
I was really worried
about you on that field.

41:45.297 --> 41:47.161
You don't need
to worry about me.

41:47.217 --> 41:49.721
In a fight, I just kinda stand
in the back

41:50.137 --> 41:51.512
and just yell stuff.

41:53.936 --> 41:55.141
Uh, I got this for you.

42:02.476 --> 42:04.631
It's beautiful.
It's my birthstone.

42:06.846 --> 42:09.490
Look, we kinda been
going out for a while,

42:10.246 --> 42:12.350
but we never really
made it official.

42:15.095 --> 42:16.430
Will you be my girlfriend?

42:17.305 --> 42:23.415
