04:13.750 --> 04:15.083
- Vince, hey,
you're never gonna--

04:15.125 --> 04:16.416
- [Vince] You know what time
it is? Dude, it's like--

04:16.458 --> 04:18.083
- I know, I know it's late.

04:18.125 --> 04:19.041
How fast can you get here?

[dramatic music]

04:25.791 --> 04:29.416
[knocking at door]

04:29.458 --> 04:31.333
- You interrupted a
perfectly good card game.

04:31.375 --> 04:32.541
- Come on man, this is big.

04:32.583 --> 04:33.958
- Are you wearing pink too?
- It's orange.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.166
- All right, all right, show me.

04:39.208 --> 04:40.000
So?

04:45.000 --> 04:46.375
- I did it.

04:46.416 --> 04:47.208
- Did what?

04:49.000 --> 04:50.416
It?

04:50.458 --> 04:52.125
Scott, you're not supposed
to run anything without me,

04:52.166 --> 04:52.916
that's our rule.

04:52.958 --> 04:54.333
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

04:54.375 --> 04:55.791
Listen, I pushed the magnetic
fields past 11 Teslas,

04:55.833 --> 04:58.708
and stabilized the
proton trajectory.

04:58.750 --> 04:59.958
I was able to beat

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
the 13 teraelectronvolt
record exponentially.

05:02.041 --> 05:03.125
- Hello?

05:03.166 --> 05:04.708
Two people present
for all experiments.

05:04.750 --> 05:07.458
Blow up the world is an actual
theoretical possibility.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.958
We don't know if this thing
is an unwieldy microwave

05:10.000 --> 05:12.541
or a black hole
planet destroyer.

05:12.583 --> 05:13.333
Two people.

05:13.375 --> 05:14.250
- Actually, we know now.

05:14.291 --> 05:16.000
Look.
Look for yourself.

05:16.041 --> 05:17.541
I've used four
sensors to measure

05:17.583 --> 05:18.750
gravity and atmospheric pressure

05:18.791 --> 05:20.208
at four points in the room.

05:22.083 --> 05:23.958
Look at those spikes, Vince.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.541
It's four and a half seconds.

05:27.375 --> 05:28.166
- Is this real?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.083
Scott, is this really real?

05:31.125 --> 05:32.041
- It's really real.

05:32.083 --> 05:33.291
- Really real?

05:33.333 --> 05:34.875
Like, you're not messing
with me at all in this?

05:34.916 --> 05:35.708
- We did it.

05:38.541 --> 05:39.666
Okay.

05:39.708 --> 05:41.125
- You're sure you're
not messing with me?

05:41.166 --> 05:42.208
- We did it.

05:43.458 --> 05:45.666
- Let's power this bad
boy up, I wanna see it.

05:45.708 --> 05:48.833
- That's the problem, that was
the four and a half seconds.

05:51.416 --> 05:52.625
- Not enough power.

05:52.666 --> 05:55.000
- It created a tear, but
it was too much heat.

05:55.041 --> 05:56.958
The power we had stored
wasn't enough to keep it open

05:57.000 --> 05:59.958
and stable, much less
investigate it safely.

06:01.041 --> 06:03.125
- Four and a half seconds.

06:03.166 --> 06:05.250
We gotta find a
sustainable power source

06:05.291 --> 06:07.000
that can keep this
thing open longer.

06:07.041 --> 06:08.291
- Did you use my coordinates?

06:08.333 --> 06:10.125
- 4.994.
- And a whole bunch of zeroes?

06:10.166 --> 06:12.833
- And a whole bunch of zeroes.

06:12.875 --> 06:14.208
- What did you see?

06:16.291 --> 06:18.125
- [Scott] This room.

06:18.166 --> 06:18.958
Different.

06:20.166 --> 06:21.500
- What if we find dinosaurs?

06:22.708 --> 06:24.333
Scott, everyone's
gonna want one.

06:25.375 --> 06:26.416
No more trash cans.

06:26.458 --> 06:27.458
You have one of these
in your kitchen,

06:27.500 --> 06:29.458
you just throw your
garbage through.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.458
- Probably just stretched
every law of physics

06:31.500 --> 06:33.000
beyond its known limitation,

06:33.041 --> 06:35.041
and your first thoughts are
dinosaurs and waste management?

06:35.083 --> 06:36.541
- Just admit that
you're curious too.

06:36.583 --> 06:38.375
Dinosaurs!

06:38.416 --> 06:40.208
- When do we tell
Cicero Market Tech?

06:42.500 --> 06:43.541
They have deep pockets,

06:43.583 --> 06:45.333
and a hunger for
this sort of thing.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.916
They can fund us.

06:49.958 --> 06:51.041
I'm thinking money Scott.

06:51.083 --> 06:52.125
No.

06:52.166 --> 06:53.666
We can't, not yet.

06:53.708 --> 06:56.541
We need to show we can open
this thing and keep it stable.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.958
We need to get a blue core
battery from them first.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.375
[tense music]

07:04.208 --> 07:06.958
You want to steal a top secret

07:07.000 --> 07:08.333
cryonic battery from Cicero?

07:08.375 --> 07:10.083
From our place of employment?

07:10.125 --> 07:11.500
The very batteries we
are using on a project

07:11.541 --> 07:13.708
that we are actually
being paid to work on?

07:13.750 --> 07:15.166
Nevermind if they even notice,

07:15.208 --> 07:17.500
it's only like 12 batteries
exist in the entire world.

07:18.500 --> 07:19.250
- Yes.

07:19.291 --> 07:21.083
[Vincent groans]

07:21.125 --> 07:22.666
Cryonic batteries
are designed to power

07:22.708 --> 07:24.750
an entire cryogenic
pod bay for a century.

07:24.791 --> 07:26.625
- Yeah, and keeping people
frozen for a long time

07:26.666 --> 07:28.541
is a far cry from
smashing God particles

07:28.583 --> 07:30.041
to create doorways
to other dimensions!

07:30.083 --> 07:31.083
- Which we just
said, by the way.

07:31.125 --> 07:32.250
- This is so cool.

07:32.291 --> 07:33.166
- We can't go any
further without them.

07:33.208 --> 07:34.291
- [Vince] Okay.

07:37.083 --> 07:39.208
I might have an idea.

07:41.166 --> 07:43.958
I think Lennon may have
already lifted one.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.291
- Lennon?

07:45.333 --> 07:46.083
Why?

07:46.125 --> 07:47.708
- Who knows why.

07:47.750 --> 07:50.375
But he may have sort of
bragged about having one once.

07:52.125 --> 07:53.708
- He's been weird lately.

07:53.750 --> 07:55.125
- Yeah, no kidding.

07:55.166 --> 07:56.750
But if he has one.

08:00.166 --> 08:02.125
- It's not stealing if
it's already stolen.

08:10.208 --> 08:12.958
- Hi there, friends, and
welcome to The Daily Do.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.333
Thank you for spending
just four minutes

08:14.375 --> 08:16.666
of your day with me and
hopefully I can help

08:16.708 --> 08:18.291
make your lives a little easier.

08:18.333 --> 08:20.041
On today's episode,
I'm gonna show you

08:20.083 --> 08:23.041
a few tricks on how to
remove ants from your home

08:23.083 --> 08:25.708
without any poisons or sprays.

08:25.750 --> 08:27.333
This is particularly beneficial.

08:27.375 --> 08:28.125
Hi.

08:28.166 --> 08:29.166
[laughing]

08:29.208 --> 08:30.791
- Did I just mess up your video?

08:30.833 --> 08:32.082
- Yeah, it's okay.

08:32.125 --> 08:33.332
You running late?

08:33.375 --> 08:34.916
- Yeah, I'm about to be.

08:34.957 --> 08:37.207
- How late were you and
Vince up last night?

08:38.457 --> 08:40.041
- Well.

08:40.082 --> 08:41.041
I think we did it.

08:43.166 --> 08:44.041
- Can you show me?

08:45.000 --> 08:46.125
- Tonight.

08:46.166 --> 08:48.041
After work, maybe, I
need one more thing.

08:48.083 --> 08:49.083
Love you.

08:49.125 --> 08:51.541
- [Margail] Love you.

08:51.583 --> 08:53.125
- Cicero Market Technologies

08:53.166 --> 08:55.000
is not only the
best in the world,

08:55.041 --> 08:58.083
We're the only ones breaking
these scientific barriers.

08:59.416 --> 09:01.125
Our reputation always makes sure

09:01.166 --> 09:03.000
that we come to market first.

09:05.041 --> 09:08.625
So please, give me a time-frame

09:08.666 --> 09:10.000
and make it aggressive.

09:13.166 --> 09:14.458
- The problem is time.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.583
Until we can successfully
put somebody under ice

09:16.625 --> 09:18.833
for longer than 96 days,
we'll never truly know

09:18.875 --> 09:21.083
what damage the
cryo process causes.

09:22.333 --> 09:23.125
- Dr. Normus.

09:24.541 --> 09:27.541
We hired you to
create a long-term

09:27.583 --> 09:29.750
storage environment
for our clients.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.416
If you had done your job
correctly from the beginning,

09:35.458 --> 09:37.333
there wouldn't be
any safety concerns.

09:38.458 --> 09:39.875
- We're still
trying to find a way

09:39.916 --> 09:42.125
to safely take measurements
from the inside, so that.

09:44.375 --> 09:45.625
- What about the trials?

09:47.833 --> 09:50.083
- Sir, results are
within parameters.

09:50.125 --> 09:54.166
But again, nothing's made it
past the 96-day threshold yet.

09:54.208 --> 09:55.791
- Tell me why.

09:55.833 --> 09:57.000
- Because after 96 days,

09:57.041 --> 09:58.791
they can't remember
their own names.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.333
- The preservation
units themselves

10:02.375 --> 10:04.125
are being damaged
by the process.

10:05.791 --> 10:06.666
We need more time.

10:08.875 --> 10:09.666
- When?

10:12.791 --> 10:13.583
- Two years.

10:16.125 --> 10:18.208
- Dr. Lennon, do you agree?

10:21.208 --> 10:22.000
- Shit!

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
So close.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.000
What was your
question, Miss Fanning?

10:28.041 --> 10:29.875
- Do you agree with
Scott's estimation

10:29.916 --> 10:32.750
of this taking one to two years
before we can go to market?

10:34.916 --> 10:36.250
- Scott's right.

10:36.291 --> 10:37.958
We can spend a year figuring out

10:38.000 --> 10:41.041
the measuring logarithms,
but the hardware as it is now

10:41.083 --> 10:42.583
can't survive the freeze.

10:42.625 --> 10:44.041
We already know that.

10:44.083 --> 10:46.666
Priority one may be to
keep the client stable,

10:46.708 --> 10:50.375
but that won't matter if we
can't monitor from the inside.

10:50.416 --> 10:52.125
- Do you need
additional resources?

10:53.166 --> 10:55.458
- One of those really
expensive espresso machines

10:55.500 --> 10:57.416
in the lounge
would be fantastic.

11:01.166 --> 11:02.708
- Are we disrupting
your day, Dr. Lennon,

11:02.750 --> 11:05.541
because I fail to
find the humor here.

11:05.583 --> 11:07.083
- I'm making a point.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.000
Throwing more money
at this won't cause

11:09.041 --> 11:11.833
the necessary technological
changes to just appear.

11:11.875 --> 11:14.208
The time it takes is
the time it takes.

11:14.250 --> 11:16.541
And you don't pay me to rush.

11:16.583 --> 11:19.041
- I'm beginning to question
why we pay you at all.

11:19.083 --> 11:20.708
- Because I'm Bob Lennon.

11:20.750 --> 11:23.458
And the only effectual
cryotician in the world

11:23.500 --> 11:25.083
who speaks English.

11:25.125 --> 11:27.083
If you want to go
public now, fine.

11:27.125 --> 11:29.500
But tell NASA and your
billionaire clients

11:29.541 --> 11:32.500
that you can put
someone in cryo-stasis,

11:32.541 --> 11:36.250
but after three months they
may, I don't know, die.

11:40.083 --> 11:41.625
- Put that on a brochure.

11:47.875 --> 11:48.666
- Fine.

11:51.958 --> 11:53.875
You have one year.

11:55.083 --> 11:56.875
But I'm growing very impatient.

11:59.333 --> 12:00.125
Dr. Lennon.

12:01.208 --> 12:02.416
I'm really beginning to question

12:02.458 --> 12:04.333
the importance of
your role here.

12:04.375 --> 12:07.083
- The other divisions
are years behind us.

12:07.125 --> 12:08.958
I'm your golden goose.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.583
Cicero will be first.

12:10.625 --> 12:13.833
- You have no idea how
easily you can be replaced.

12:16.041 --> 12:17.458
- All right, listen.

12:17.500 --> 12:18.916
You guys are all brilliant.

12:19.791 --> 12:21.125
Give us results.

12:24.166 --> 12:25.333
Thank you, Dr. Lennon.

12:26.583 --> 12:27.791
- [Lennon] My pleasure.

12:32.541 --> 12:33.333
- Gentlemen.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Is there anything
you'd like to add?

12:38.583 --> 12:40.041
- No, sir.

12:40.083 --> 12:41.291
- What's Project Milestone?

12:43.125 --> 12:44.666
- Where'd you hear this name?

12:47.250 --> 12:48.250
- Overheard someone.

12:49.791 --> 12:52.000
- There are no other projects
that require your attention

12:52.041 --> 12:54.000
except the one
you're currently on.

12:56.708 --> 12:57.750
Thank you, gentlemen.

13:06.750 --> 13:07.958
- You know they need
to steal from us.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.083
- Of course I know that.

13:11.083 --> 13:13.083
But it has to be this way.

13:14.625 --> 13:16.083
And it has to be them.

13:17.541 --> 13:21.208
- It's always them.

13:21.250 --> 13:23.875
[eerie music]

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
- You sure this
is Lennon's place?

13:44.041 --> 13:45.000
- Pretty sure.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.500
I was here like two nights
ago. We play poker on Tuesdays.

13:49.791 --> 13:50.583
- Lennon?

13:51.500 --> 13:52.375
He hates gambling.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.041
He hates people.

13:56.083 --> 13:57.208
- He changed his mind?

13:58.166 --> 13:59.375
- Something changed.

14:00.291 --> 14:01.416
If you two are so chummy,

14:01.458 --> 14:02.708
why don't you just
ask him for the thing?

14:02.750 --> 14:03.541
- Hell no!

14:03.583 --> 14:06.625
He's got a crazy short fuse.

14:06.666 --> 14:09.375
He's like the world's
scariest math teacher.

14:09.416 --> 14:12.125
Hey Lennon, you know that
thing that you stole from work?

14:12.166 --> 14:13.333
Can I have it?

14:16.000 --> 14:17.708
- I can't believe
we're doing this.

14:19.166 --> 14:21.041
- Not stealing if
it's already stolen.

14:22.458 --> 14:24.625
- You know that's not
actually true, right?

14:48.041 --> 14:51.541
- Think you can hurry
that up a little bit?

15:08.375 --> 15:09.166
What?

15:13.791 --> 15:16.375
[spray misting]

15:19.833 --> 15:21.791
So you were James
Bond in another life?

15:23.333 --> 15:25.958
[tense music]

15:47.208 --> 15:48.166
Is that real money?

15:50.083 --> 15:52.083
What, you're a hotshot
card player now, too?

16:01.416 --> 16:02.958
- [Vince] You check that side.

16:32.458 --> 16:35.166
- [Scott] Come on, where is it?

16:45.833 --> 16:48.750
Why does he have the blueprints
for a Large Hadron Collider?

16:51.125 --> 16:52.333
- How pissed do
you think he'll be

16:52.375 --> 16:53.208
when he finds out we've
that we scaled that down

16:53.250 --> 16:55.000
to fifty feet in your garage?

17:07.250 --> 17:09.500
- I don't think he'll
be very pissed at all.

17:09.540 --> 17:10.750
- Ha.

17:10.790 --> 17:11.583
Got it.

17:27.165 --> 17:29.083
Why the fuck does he have that?

17:29.125 --> 17:31.875
- These are all the parts
to a particle accelerator.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.166
Why would he have this?

17:36.250 --> 17:37.625
Did you tell him what
we're working on?

17:37.666 --> 17:39.041
- Me?
No, did you?

17:39.083 --> 17:42.125
- No of course not, Vince.
What the hell is going on?

17:44.250 --> 17:47.166
[far off coughing]

18:27.458 --> 18:28.791
[gunshot firing]

18:28.833 --> 18:31.625
[Lennon groaning]

18:38.375 --> 18:41.041
[Lennon gasping]

18:53.458 --> 18:56.083
- [Masked Man] You
stupid son of a bitch.

18:58.125 --> 19:00.166
You brought this upon yourself.

19:00.208 --> 19:03.000
[Lennon groaning]

19:29.458 --> 19:30.208
- No wait, where are you going?

19:30.250 --> 19:31.291
- [Vince] He's gone.

19:31.333 --> 19:32.083
- You don't know that.

19:32.125 --> 19:33.125
- He's gone, come on.

19:35.708 --> 19:36.500
Come on.

19:42.166 --> 19:43.583
- Oh God, they took him.

19:52.750 --> 19:54.166
He killed a man.

19:54.208 --> 19:56.333
He killed him, and we
didn't do anything.

19:56.375 --> 19:58.041
- He had a gun.

19:58.083 --> 19:59.541
- We could have done
something, we didn't know that.

19:59.583 --> 20:00.416
- He had a gun!

20:03.666 --> 20:05.291
- What the hell's
going on, Vince?

20:07.166 --> 20:08.416
- We have what we
need, let's go.

20:08.458 --> 20:09.708
We were never here.

20:09.750 --> 20:10.958
- Whoa, are you serious?

20:11.000 --> 20:11.750
We can't.

20:11.791 --> 20:12.541
We gotta call the police.

20:12.583 --> 20:14.083
- And explain what first?

20:14.125 --> 20:16.875
The breaking and entering, or
the glowing fucking battery?

20:18.791 --> 20:19.583
- Unbelievable.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.958
Why would they take his body?

20:23.000 --> 20:24.083
- We need to go.

20:24.125 --> 20:25.166
Now.

20:27.250 --> 20:28.000
Scott!

20:31.291 --> 20:33.916
[car beeping]

20:38.916 --> 20:41.625
[birds chirping]

20:53.291 --> 20:54.083
- Hey.

20:56.083 --> 20:57.958
- You look tired, babe.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.208
- Yeah, I didn't sleep too well.

21:01.250 --> 21:02.458
- Is everything okay?

21:05.541 --> 21:06.375
- Yeah.

21:06.416 --> 21:08.875
Yeah, we kinda had a setback.

21:09.916 --> 21:11.083
- I'm sure you'll figure it out.

21:11.125 --> 21:12.708
Stargate's got nothing on you.

21:15.250 --> 21:17.833
- Stargate goes to
different worlds, babe.

21:17.875 --> 21:19.000
Theoretically, this will take us

21:19.041 --> 21:20.375
to different versions
of the same world.

21:20.416 --> 21:21.666
- [laughing] Nerd.

21:23.083 --> 21:25.291
So I have to do a night
video shoot tonight.

21:25.333 --> 21:27.166
I'm gonna explain snipe hunting.

21:27.208 --> 21:28.375
So don't wait up.

21:31.125 --> 21:32.625
- [Vince] Scott.

21:32.666 --> 21:34.000
Have you heard anything?

21:34.041 --> 21:34.875
- I haven't heard anything.
Have you heard anything?

21:34.916 --> 21:35.750
- I haven't heard anything.

21:35.791 --> 21:36.666
Why haven't you heard anything?

21:36.708 --> 21:37.958
- Gentlemen!

21:38.000 --> 21:40.083
Good, you're both here.

21:40.125 --> 21:41.666
Dr. Lennon would
like to talk with you

21:41.708 --> 21:42.916
in the conference room.

22:05.416 --> 22:06.250
- Oh, boys!

22:07.666 --> 22:10.708
I wanted to apologize
for my behavior yesterday

22:10.750 --> 22:11.750
in front of Miss Fanning,

22:11.791 --> 22:13.583
and the head of
this establishment.

22:13.625 --> 22:15.083
It was very unprofessional.

22:17.250 --> 22:20.375
- Do you accept Dr.
Lennon's apology?

22:21.416 --> 22:22.291
- Yeah, of course.

22:22.333 --> 22:23.541
- No problem.

22:24.500 --> 22:25.541
- Great.

22:25.583 --> 22:27.375
With that unpleasantness
out of the way,

22:27.416 --> 22:29.375
then we can all
get back to work.

22:29.416 --> 22:31.041
Gentlemen.

22:31.083 --> 22:32.166
- Keep up the good work, guys.

22:32.208 --> 22:33.875
We'll figure this out just yet.

22:43.083 --> 22:44.500
- What the hell?

22:46.166 --> 22:49.083
Are we slipping into The
Twilight Zone or something here?

22:49.125 --> 22:50.083
- We saw it happen.

22:51.458 --> 22:52.250
Right?

22:53.375 --> 22:54.208
We saw it.

22:57.583 --> 22:58.750
- Bet your ass we did.

23:00.041 --> 23:01.791
- Maybe last night was a trick

23:03.333 --> 23:05.083
to mess with us for breaking in.

23:06.541 --> 23:07.333
- I don't know.

23:10.166 --> 23:11.416
- Let's hope this works.

23:13.083 --> 23:14.958
- Going deeper
into the weirdness.

23:15.000 --> 23:15.750
Why not?

23:24.875 --> 23:28.375
[air whooshing from hatch]

23:30.583 --> 23:33.291
[hatch cranking]

23:39.125 --> 23:40.083
- Coordinates?

23:40.125 --> 23:42.333
- Locked, 4.994%
ordinary matter.

23:46.500 --> 23:47.958
- And a whole bunch of zeroes?

23:48.000 --> 23:49.041
- And a whole bunch of zeroes.

23:49.083 --> 23:50.666
- [Scott] Energy level?

23:50.708 --> 23:52.916
- 77 teraelectronvolts.

23:52.958 --> 23:56.458
[tense instrumental music]

24:00.500 --> 24:01.541
- Let's make history.

24:04.541 --> 24:07.333
[remote clicking]

24:09.666 --> 24:12.375
[sparks buzzing]

24:14.875 --> 24:16.208
Open it more.

24:16.250 --> 24:19.041
[remote clicking]

24:23.125 --> 24:24.708
- You really did it.

24:29.541 --> 24:31.000
- We really did it.

24:32.500 --> 24:33.583
- How long will it stay open?

24:33.625 --> 24:34.541
- With the cryonic
battery, who knows?

24:34.583 --> 24:35.375
Maybe forever.

24:38.750 --> 24:40.458
Okay. Gravity readings,
do you have any decay?

24:40.500 --> 24:42.500
[keyboard clacking]

24:42.541 --> 24:43.916
- Nothing.

24:43.958 --> 24:45.875
It's like the door
isn't even there.

24:52.916 --> 24:54.000
How is it the same?

24:55.375 --> 24:58.041
Infinite possibilities,
and we dial into a mirror.

25:15.833 --> 25:16.916
- I wanna cross over.

25:20.041 --> 25:21.375
- I don't think we should.

25:21.416 --> 25:22.458
- [Scott] What?

25:22.500 --> 25:23.750
- Not there.

25:23.791 --> 25:24.583
- Why not?

25:26.083 --> 25:27.250
- It's the same.

25:27.291 --> 25:28.333
Doesn't that bother you?

25:28.375 --> 25:29.750
- Bother me how?

25:29.791 --> 25:32.000
We just smashed particles
faster than anyone, ever.

25:32.041 --> 25:34.125
We ripped open space and time.

25:36.500 --> 25:38.500
- Scott, it's the same!

25:38.541 --> 25:40.958
Your room, your garage,
your test dummy.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.375
Same room and same
dummy means same us.

25:43.416 --> 25:45.958
A trillion, trillion,
trillion times a gazillion

25:46.000 --> 25:48.250
possibilities with every
microscopic change,

25:48.291 --> 25:50.041
and we just happen
to dial into the one

25:50.083 --> 25:51.500
that could have our
damn doppelgangers?

25:51.541 --> 25:52.541
- They were your coordinates.

25:52.583 --> 25:53.958
- [Vince] And I was wrong.

25:55.416 --> 25:57.666
- No, Vince, this one's perfect.

25:58.833 --> 25:59.958
What happens if we
choose to open a doorway

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
that's 4.994% with
1,000 zeroes after it,

26:04.041 --> 26:07.250
but a one at the very end,
instead of another zero?

26:07.291 --> 26:08.958
And that leads us to some
Earth that's long gone,

26:09.000 --> 26:12.333
and we turn Arizona into
a literal black hole.

26:12.375 --> 26:14.375
- You know as well as I do
that we would need an extreme,

26:14.416 --> 26:17.000
like 1% or 10% gravity
and comparative matter

26:17.041 --> 26:19.250
before we find an Earth that's
populated by sand people!

26:19.291 --> 26:21.416
- That's why this one's perfect.

26:21.458 --> 26:23.333
We hit a home run
in our first at-bat.

26:27.250 --> 26:28.000
Vince, look.

26:29.500 --> 26:33.250
Between Lennon dying, and
then not dying, and now this,

26:33.291 --> 26:35.833
it's been a crazy few days.
All right, we'll figure it out.

26:35.875 --> 26:37.250
- Don't open it
again without me.

26:39.458 --> 26:41.041
Right?

26:41.083 --> 26:42.416
- Right.
- Right?

26:42.458 --> 26:43.333
- Got it!

26:43.375 --> 26:44.750
Won't open it without you.

26:53.916 --> 26:55.583
- This is a nice surprise.

26:55.625 --> 26:57.208
I thought you'd
be in the garage.

27:04.083 --> 27:05.625
- We need to talk.

27:06.583 --> 27:07.375
- What happened?

27:10.416 --> 27:12.000
Did someone die?

27:15.125 --> 27:18.125
[crickets chirping]

27:20.000 --> 27:23.125
So why didn't you
call the police?

27:24.541 --> 27:26.250
- Yeah, they're usually letting
people off with warnings

27:26.291 --> 27:28.541
for breaking and
entering nowadays.

27:28.583 --> 27:31.666
It doesn't matter, 'cause
apparently he's alive and fine.

27:33.125 --> 27:34.333
- This is so bizarre, Scott.

27:34.375 --> 27:36.791
I mean, it's gotta be
some kind of a trick.

27:36.833 --> 27:39.958
Do you think he's just
messing with you guys?

27:40.000 --> 27:41.125
- I don't know.

27:41.166 --> 27:43.083
Maybe we're not meant
to understand it.

27:44.916 --> 27:48.541
- But the particle
accelerator works?

27:48.583 --> 27:50.000
Like, for real?

27:51.166 --> 27:52.208
- [Scott] Yeah.

27:53.458 --> 27:55.250
- I'm so proud of you!

27:56.375 --> 27:57.916
When do I get to see it?

27:58.958 --> 27:59.833
- Soon.

27:59.875 --> 28:01.166
Vincent needs to be here.

28:02.500 --> 28:04.000
- I knew you could do it.

28:04.041 --> 28:07.041
You're gonna find out, like,
what makes the universe tick.

28:12.333 --> 28:14.666
I bet the Lennon at work today

28:14.708 --> 28:16.958
is like a double
from the other side.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.375
[eerie music]

28:28.958 --> 28:31.333

[wind whooshing]

31:10.000 --> 31:11.416
[light switch clicking]

31:11.458 --> 31:13.375
- [Other Scott] Don't let
that door close behind you.

31:15.833 --> 31:16.833
- I wasn't planning on it.

31:16.875 --> 31:17.625
- [Other Scott]
Have you discovered

31:17.666 --> 31:18.833
the Expulsion Theory yet?

31:18.875 --> 31:19.791
- Wow.

31:23.041 --> 31:24.666
No, the what?

31:24.708 --> 31:25.750
- Yeah.

31:25.791 --> 31:27.000
As in two objects
of the same matter

31:27.041 --> 31:28.750
can't exist on the same side.

31:30.041 --> 31:32.083
If that doorway to your
matterverse closes behind you,

31:32.125 --> 31:33.833
with both of us here,

31:33.875 --> 31:35.208
one of us goes, "Poof!"

31:36.625 --> 31:37.875
It's a toss of the
dice which one of us

31:37.916 --> 31:39.375
takes the long trip goodbye.

31:39.416 --> 31:41.916
Still not sure where they
go, but it looks painful.

31:44.875 --> 31:45.958
- Wow.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
This is overwhelming.

31:49.166 --> 31:50.833
- Yeah, I've heard that before.

31:53.833 --> 31:55.958
Bet you're wondering about
that dummy over there.

31:56.875 --> 31:58.125
Never really found
much use for it,

31:58.166 --> 32:00.041
but we all seem to
buy the same dummy.

32:01.041 --> 32:03.333
I bought one, because I
figured with endless universes

32:03.375 --> 32:07.125
and endless variables,
a constant would

32:09.166 --> 32:10.083
What'd you name it?

32:13.458 --> 32:15.083
- What?

32:15.125 --> 32:17.541
- [Other Scott] The
dummy, Jimmy or Johnny?

32:17.583 --> 32:18.666
- Oh, Jay.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.166
I named it Jay.

32:21.208 --> 32:22.375
I guess I thought I
would throw it through

32:22.416 --> 32:24.333
before I just walked
through on my own.

32:25.500 --> 32:26.291
- Very curious.

32:27.500 --> 32:29.958
The names have always been.

32:31.208 --> 32:33.333
- I'm sorry, did you
say, "All of us"?

32:33.375 --> 32:36.291
- This isn't our first
time together, Scott.

32:36.333 --> 32:40.041
No, not the first time for
you in another version of us.

32:40.083 --> 32:42.291
36 Scotts have all traveled
through space and time,

32:42.333 --> 32:43.500
and into my workshop.

32:45.041 --> 32:46.125
You're 37.

32:48.166 --> 32:49.666
So forgive my lack
of enthusiasm,

32:49.708 --> 32:52.708
but I think even God stopped
being surprised after a while.

32:54.916 --> 32:56.375
- I never cared much for tea.

32:57.250 --> 32:58.958
- I didn't make it for you.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.750
[slurping tea]

33:03.000 --> 33:04.250
What's your matter variable?

33:06.166 --> 33:07.916
- Five, a bunch of
zeroes, nine, seven

33:07.958 --> 33:09.250
as far as I was able to tell.

33:11.541 --> 33:15.458
I'm sorry, why do all
of us come here to you?

33:18.500 --> 33:19.333
- There's an immeasurable number

33:19.375 --> 33:21.083
of universes out there, Scottie.

33:22.166 --> 33:24.000
A different world for
every different person,

33:24.041 --> 33:25.291
for every different outcome.

33:26.541 --> 33:28.583
So if you take an
immeasurable number of people

33:28.625 --> 33:30.041
and ask them to
all choose a number

33:30.083 --> 33:32.250
between one and a million,
eventually you'll get enough

33:32.291 --> 33:34.125
to choose the same
number, right?

33:35.083 --> 33:38.166
And so far, 37 Scotts
have all lived lives

33:38.208 --> 33:41.041
that lead to this machine,
to this point in time,

33:41.083 --> 33:44.125
to the exact 4.994%
ordinary matter.

33:45.083 --> 33:46.208
And a bunch of zeroes.

33:48.083 --> 33:49.958
- Have you ever crossed over?

33:50.000 --> 33:50.791
- No.

34:04.541 --> 34:05.791
You can touch me, Scott.

34:07.500 --> 34:08.916
Like I said,
expulsion only happens

34:08.958 --> 34:10.291
when that doorway closes,

34:11.541 --> 34:12.625
in which case, you
and I would be in

34:12.666 --> 34:14.000
for one hell of a pickle.

34:16.333 --> 34:17.750
- You had your own machine.

34:18.791 --> 34:20.166
- I did.

34:20.208 --> 34:21.000
Once.

34:22.250 --> 34:24.083
Couldn't create a
sustainable power source.

34:24.125 --> 34:26.166
Speaking of which,
you have any more

34:26.208 --> 34:27.750
of those cryonic batteries?

34:31.125 --> 34:32.750
- How do you know about that?

34:32.791 --> 34:34.166
- It's not my first rodeo.

34:35.625 --> 34:37.541
- Well no, I only have the one,

34:37.583 --> 34:40.375
and it's being used to
power the doorway right now.

34:40.416 --> 34:41.208
- Only one.

34:42.750 --> 34:44.041
It's a shame.

34:44.083 --> 34:45.666
Although, I wonder if
you could get another one

34:45.708 --> 34:47.250
from Cicero before
it's too late.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.708
- What do you mean?

34:56.333 --> 34:58.166
- Cicero stole my
machine, Scott.

34:59.500 --> 35:00.750
They manipulated it.

35:01.666 --> 35:03.583
Bastardized it.

35:03.625 --> 35:04.958
They gained too much
power too quickly,

35:05.000 --> 35:06.666
and it was too much to control.

35:07.750 --> 35:08.833
They're responsible
for the worst

35:08.875 --> 35:10.250
man-made disaster of all time.

35:11.166 --> 35:12.291
Countless people died.

35:14.083 --> 35:16.875
Everyone in Cicero is
gone, I'm all that's left.

35:18.083 --> 35:19.083
Even Vincent's gone.

35:21.458 --> 35:22.250
- Vincent?

35:24.458 --> 35:27.125
No, that's impossible.

35:27.166 --> 35:28.875
How could they
steal my technology?

35:29.750 --> 35:31.583
- You ever heard of
Project Milestone?

35:33.000 --> 35:34.666
- Only rumors, whispers.

35:34.708 --> 35:35.500
- Scott.

35:37.250 --> 35:39.166
Project Milestone is you.

35:42.083 --> 35:43.125
- No.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.708
That's impossible.

35:45.750 --> 35:47.208
- I guarantee it.

35:47.250 --> 35:48.875
If your universe is
anything like mine,

35:48.916 --> 35:51.541
they've been watching you for
a long time, studying you.

35:51.583 --> 35:53.000
Waiting for you to succeed.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.250
They did the same to me.

35:57.125 --> 35:59.166
You're more special
than you know.

35:59.208 --> 36:00.750
- What are you trying to say?

36:01.708 --> 36:03.000
- Your machine is the only one

36:03.041 --> 36:04.416
that can create a stable path.

36:05.458 --> 36:07.708
They wanna use it to
connect everything,

36:07.750 --> 36:09.166
like some master pathway.

36:10.416 --> 36:12.083
But not just two worlds, Scott.

36:13.291 --> 36:14.291
All of them.

36:18.208 --> 36:19.000
Scott.

36:20.208 --> 36:22.083
Project Milestone is
you leading Cicero

36:22.125 --> 36:26.000
to a singularity in which
they control the multiverse.

36:29.333 --> 36:30.791
- How do you know all this?

36:33.375 --> 36:35.083
- Just watch yourself, Scottie.

36:36.041 --> 36:37.500
These people you work
for turned a quarter

36:37.541 --> 36:39.500
of my United States
into no man's land.

36:40.375 --> 36:42.166
They tried here once
and they failed,

36:43.500 --> 36:45.000
and now you're on the clock.

36:46.833 --> 36:48.416
Be careful who you trust.

36:57.375 --> 36:59.666
- This is a lot to take in.

37:01.791 --> 37:03.666
I need to talk to
my wife and Vince.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.458
- Your wife?

37:08.500 --> 37:11.041
- [Scott] Listen, this has
been beyond amazing, thank you.

37:13.708 --> 37:15.000
- But you will come back.

37:15.041 --> 37:15.833
- I'll be back.

37:30.875 --> 37:32.041
- [Other Scott] You always do.

37:37.875 --> 37:40.666
[remote clicking]

37:58.375 --> 38:00.208
[phone ringing]

38:00.250 --> 38:02.958
- [Vince] This is
Vince, leave a message.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.041
- Vince. Hey, call me back
when you get this, all right?

38:05.083 --> 38:06.125
We need to chat.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.083
Just call me back.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.500
- Hello, Scott.

38:13.541 --> 38:15.166
No partner in crime?

38:17.208 --> 38:18.791
How is the family?

38:18.833 --> 38:21.041
It's Margaret?

38:21.083 --> 38:21.958
Margail, isn't it?

38:23.166 --> 38:24.458
She's such a sweetheart.

38:26.708 --> 38:28.208
- I really should
get back to work.

38:28.250 --> 38:29.333
- You really should.

38:52.500 --> 38:53.250
- Hello!

38:53.291 --> 38:54.291
- Hi there.

38:54.333 --> 38:56.166
- Just out enjoying my walk.

38:56.208 --> 38:57.291
- I can see that.

38:57.333 --> 38:59.000
You live nearby?

38:59.041 --> 39:00.916
- Why, yes.

39:00.958 --> 39:02.083
- Oh, I haven't seen you before.

39:02.125 --> 39:03.333
Have you just moved in?

39:05.750 --> 39:08.125
- That's a very fancy
camera you have there.

39:08.166 --> 39:09.875
- Yeah, it's not great,

39:09.916 --> 39:11.666
but it works for me.

39:11.708 --> 39:14.416
I just make videos
and teach people

39:14.458 --> 39:16.833
how to do odd jobs
around the house.

39:16.875 --> 39:19.458
- And what does
your husband make?

39:20.500 --> 39:24.625
- He works at Cicero
Market Technologies.

39:24.666 --> 39:28.375
- Oh, that's a very large
company, like Haliburton.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.041
- Something like that, yeah.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.166
- Can he protect you?

39:38.750 --> 39:39.541
- Excuse me?

39:41.208 --> 39:43.625
- You're a beautiful woman.

39:43.666 --> 39:45.375
He should be able
to protect you.

39:47.416 --> 39:49.333
- It's been great
chatting with you,

39:49.375 --> 39:52.166
I really gotta get
back to work here.

39:52.208 --> 39:54.166
Will I be seeing you around?

39:55.041 --> 39:56.083
- Oh yes.

39:56.125 --> 39:57.125
[laughing]

39:57.166 --> 39:58.291
I'll keep an eye out for you!

40:14.666 --> 40:15.541
- Oh, shit.

40:47.041 --> 40:49.750
[dramatic music]

41:59.708 --> 42:02.375
[metal clanking]

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
[suspenseful music]

42:42.666 --> 42:45.375
[gunshot firing]

42:56.208 --> 42:58.125
- It doesn't have
to be this way.

42:58.166 --> 43:00.000
- [Masked Man] I don't
want to kill you.

43:00.041 --> 43:02.291
I wanted you to see how
easily someone could have.

43:02.333 --> 43:03.375
- Just let me go back.

43:03.416 --> 43:05.166
- [Masked Man] There is no back.

43:09.208 --> 43:10.000
Uh-uh.

43:12.166 --> 43:13.958
- What do you mean?

43:14.000 --> 43:15.208
- [Masked Man] Cicero.

43:15.250 --> 43:17.708
They keep trying, and
they keep screwing up.

43:17.750 --> 43:20.958
You keep screwing up, and
now worlds are disappearing.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.708
They're gone.

43:22.750 --> 43:24.208
You have to stop him, Vincent.

43:25.125 --> 43:25.958
- Who?

43:26.000 --> 43:27.625
- [Masked Man] Scott.

43:27.666 --> 43:30.041
You have to stop him
before he kills everyone.

43:31.916 --> 43:34.583
[portal buzzing]

43:50.875 --> 43:52.541
- [Vince] What the
hell is going on?

43:58.000 --> 44:00.125
- Do you think that
is what I think it is?

44:02.250 --> 44:04.000
- Looks an awful lot like a bug.

44:06.916 --> 44:09.500
[shoe smacking]

44:11.125 --> 44:13.291
Well, whatever it is,
it's not working anymore.

44:14.625 --> 44:18.333
- Someone has planted a
bug in our house, Scott.

44:18.375 --> 44:21.166
Someone is listening to us.

44:21.208 --> 44:22.166
- Did you check the
rest of the house?

44:22.208 --> 44:23.500
- Of course I did.

44:23.541 --> 44:24.541
I looked everywhere.

44:26.958 --> 44:28.083
Maybe it's just the one?

44:32.250 --> 44:35.083
Do you think Vincent would have
like a scanner or something

44:35.125 --> 44:38.000
that looks for bugs, like on TV?

44:39.000 --> 44:41.041
- He might, but.

44:41.083 --> 44:42.125
- [Margail] But what?

44:44.541 --> 44:46.541
- He didn't show
up to work today,

44:46.583 --> 44:48.166
and I can't get ahold of him.

44:49.250 --> 44:51.083
What the hell is
going on, Scott?

44:51.125 --> 44:52.791
Why would someone
wanna spy on us?

44:57.041 --> 44:58.083
- I may have an idea.

45:00.166 --> 45:02.166
There's someone I
want you to meet, but.

45:03.708 --> 45:05.000
Honey, you might
wanna prepare yourself

45:05.041 --> 45:06.208
for a bit of a shock.

45:16.791 --> 45:17.541
[remote clicking]

45:17.583 --> 45:20.375
[machine buzzing]

45:24.666 --> 45:25.625
- Oh, shit!

45:25.666 --> 45:26.458
- Is that safe?

45:26.500 --> 45:28.875
- Margail, it's really you.

45:30.083 --> 45:32.125
After all this time,
it's really you.

45:34.083 --> 45:35.250
You look just like her.

45:35.291 --> 45:38.125
- You look just like him.

45:38.166 --> 45:39.916
- Scott.

45:39.958 --> 45:40.750
- Yes, Scottie?

45:42.791 --> 45:44.666
- How many times
have you guys talked?

45:46.375 --> 45:47.916
- Only once.

45:47.958 --> 45:49.625
Vincent doesn't know yet.

45:49.666 --> 45:51.458
- You did this alone?

45:51.500 --> 45:53.000
- I was feeling adventurous.

46:00.708 --> 46:02.166
- Just the one?

46:02.208 --> 46:03.750
- [Scott] Unfortunately, yes.

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
- Is there one of
me on your side?

46:14.041 --> 46:16.166
- Sadly, no.

46:16.208 --> 46:19.125
My Margail passed away
when we were teenagers.

46:19.166 --> 46:21.041
I never thought
I'd see you again.

46:26.750 --> 46:28.666
- What happened to her?

46:28.708 --> 46:29.500
- She was sick.

46:30.875 --> 46:32.500
That's how I originally
chose my career path

46:32.541 --> 46:34.958
with Cicero Market Technologies.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.208
I thought that if
I could find a way

46:36.250 --> 46:39.000
to slow down or freeze
time, I could come up

46:39.041 --> 46:41.583
with the exact timeframe
I needed to find a cure.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.083
I didn't want anyone to go
through what she went through.

46:46.125 --> 46:47.416
- [Margail] I'm so sorry.

46:49.083 --> 46:51.333
- You're the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

46:55.041 --> 46:57.208
- Flattered, I mean.

46:58.375 --> 47:00.166
That's flattering.

47:00.208 --> 47:02.625
- Scott, we need to talk
to you about Cicero.

47:02.666 --> 47:05.000
- So you two have been
together this whole time?

47:06.958 --> 47:09.750
- Scott, you said Cicero
was following you?

47:09.791 --> 47:12.583
- Yes, spies and
electronic eavesdropping.

47:13.791 --> 47:15.833
- We've found something strange.

47:15.875 --> 47:19.208
We think it's some sort
of listening device.

47:19.250 --> 47:21.708
- Well, if you found
one, it's one of many.

47:21.750 --> 47:23.583
Has anyone acted
strangely around you?

47:23.625 --> 47:24.708
- No.

47:24.750 --> 47:25.750
- Yes.

47:25.791 --> 47:26.833
A man.

47:26.875 --> 47:27.625
- What?

47:27.666 --> 47:29.000
Who?
When?

47:29.041 --> 47:32.125
- Today, an old man
talked to me out front.

47:32.166 --> 47:35.958
He asked me if I felt safe.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.208
- That's them, I'm sorry.

47:37.250 --> 47:38.958
All I can tell you is,

47:39.000 --> 47:40.083
watch yourselves.

47:41.666 --> 47:43.500
Don't trust anyone.

47:43.541 --> 47:45.166
Not even Vincent.

47:45.208 --> 47:46.625
- I trust Vincent with my life.

47:49.250 --> 47:50.125
- You may have to.

47:55.250 --> 47:56.208
You smell good.

47:58.500 --> 48:00.375
- Perhaps that's
enough for one night.

48:02.958 --> 48:03.750
- Perhaps.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.166
- We appreciate it.

48:08.500 --> 48:13.208
This has been bizarre,
and scary, and incredible.

48:15.791 --> 48:16.583
- Margail.

48:18.083 --> 48:20.000
If I could close that
magical door behind me

48:20.041 --> 48:22.041
and stay here with
you forever, I would.

48:23.291 --> 48:25.583
You're the loveliest
creature I've ever seen.

48:32.791 --> 48:33.666
Again?

48:33.708 --> 48:34.500
- Soon.

48:35.750 --> 48:37.000
- I'll hold you to that.

48:48.791 --> 48:50.916
[Margail sighs]

48:50.958 --> 48:51.750
- Wow.

48:54.041 --> 48:55.166
You did it.

48:56.083 --> 48:58.166
[laughing]

49:13.750 --> 49:16.458
So we're just keeping
up appearances.

49:16.500 --> 49:19.083
You're not gonna confront
Cicero about this?

49:19.125 --> 49:21.041
- Still no word from Vincent.

49:21.083 --> 49:23.041
I'm starting to get
real worried, babe.

49:23.083 --> 49:25.333
- Scott, I've been
thinking about this,

49:25.375 --> 49:28.958
and maybe it's time to
consider that this whole thing

49:29.000 --> 49:31.541
is just beyond our control.

49:31.583 --> 49:32.333
- No, no, no, no.

49:32.375 --> 49:33.625
No, we can't stop now.

49:33.666 --> 49:36.166
Think of all the
technological applications.

49:36.208 --> 49:38.708
No more landfills, no more
running out of resources.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.791
- Okay, so you wanna
run a oil pipeline

49:42.833 --> 49:45.750
through a portal to
an alternate reality?

49:45.791 --> 49:47.458
- That's not exactly
what I meant.

49:47.500 --> 49:49.041
- It's not exactly
what I meant either.

49:49.083 --> 49:52.416
But I mean, people
are spying on us.

49:52.458 --> 49:54.541
There's another Scott.

49:54.583 --> 49:57.875
I mean, he is definitely
freaking me out

49:57.916 --> 50:01.000
the more I think about it,
and he's definitely not you,

50:01.041 --> 50:02.833
regardless of the similarity.

50:04.625 --> 50:06.958
- Nature versus
nurture, I guess.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.041
Technically, though,
we are the same DNA.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.958
- Yeah, well technically,
he still freaks me out.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.083
All of this does.

50:15.416 --> 50:16.625
- I know, babe.

50:16.666 --> 50:19.666
[suspenseful music]

50:21.708 --> 50:23.916
[buzzing]

50:31.125 --> 50:34.666
I don't know why he
thinks Cicero will

50:34.708 --> 50:36.541
- Maybe they really
do wanna build

50:36.583 --> 50:38.041
an oil pipeline through it.

50:38.083 --> 50:39.666
- No, they could
buy the IP from us

50:39.708 --> 50:41.958
and turn it into a gold mine.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.625
Now, when this goes public,

50:43.666 --> 50:45.041
everyone's gonna wanna see it.

50:49.375 --> 50:53.541
- Unless they have a
reason to keep it secret.

50:58.958 --> 51:03.291
Okay Scott, enough with the
unlimited resources bullshit.

51:03.333 --> 51:06.625
What's the real reason you're
so obsessed with this thing?

51:13.541 --> 51:14.583
What's going on?

51:20.041 --> 51:22.541
[somber music]

51:24.000 --> 51:25.833
- I never told
you how Sean died.

51:27.291 --> 51:28.208
- Yeah, you did.

51:28.250 --> 51:30.333
I thought it was a car accident.

51:30.375 --> 51:32.083
- No, this project.

51:33.166 --> 51:35.125
It gives us a chance to go back.

51:35.166 --> 51:36.208
- I don't understand.

51:43.666 --> 51:46.750
- My grandpa collected
World War II era weapons.

51:46.791 --> 51:48.333
Pistols, rifles, such.

51:51.666 --> 51:53.208
I remember when I
was a little boy,

51:53.250 --> 51:55.125
my mom spanked my
butt so hard one time

51:55.166 --> 51:57.125
when I left the
cabinet unlocked.

51:57.166 --> 51:58.583
Yeah, I was six years old.

51:58.625 --> 52:01.208
I knew they were dangerous,
but I wanted to have fun.

52:05.625 --> 52:07.125
I left it unlocked.

52:10.541 --> 52:13.416
Sean was four years old.

52:13.458 --> 52:15.333
He wanted to play too.

52:17.458 --> 52:19.791
That's how my brother died.

52:24.500 --> 52:29.125
The whole idea of this project
of smashing God particles

52:29.166 --> 52:31.291
and creating doorways
into other dimensions.

52:33.583 --> 52:35.958
If there's infinite
worlds out there,

52:36.000 --> 52:40.375
then there's a different world
for every different outcome,

52:40.416 --> 52:41.833
for every different person.

52:45.000 --> 52:49.916
Maybe there's a world
where I didn't do that.

52:53.666 --> 52:55.958
I want that world, Margail.

52:58.291 --> 53:01.083
[phone vibrating]

53:03.500 --> 53:05.625
- [Margail] I'm so sorry.

53:07.083 --> 53:08.125
- Vince?

53:09.041 --> 53:10.208
We've been trying to reach.

53:12.000 --> 53:12.833
Yeah.

53:12.875 --> 53:13.708
Yeah, yeah, no.

53:13.750 --> 53:15.166
I'll be right out, two minutes.

53:18.250 --> 53:19.916
That was Vince.

53:19.958 --> 53:21.208
He sounded really weird.

53:24.041 --> 53:27.750
I gotta go.

53:27.791 --> 53:29.333
- Go ahead, go talk to him.

53:29.375 --> 53:30.708
Get to work.

53:30.750 --> 53:33.125
I guess we'll just take
this one day at a time.

53:41.916 --> 53:42.708
- Hey.

53:46.083 --> 53:48.916
- I didn't wanna risk using a
cellphone if I didn't have to.

53:48.958 --> 53:49.791
- What happened?

53:49.833 --> 53:51.125
- You're never gonna believe me.

53:52.208 --> 53:53.708
- I was about to
say the same thing.

53:53.750 --> 53:56.125
- Well, I was shot at
and held at gunpoint

53:56.166 --> 53:57.500
by a man who used
what sure as hell

53:57.541 --> 54:00.041
looked like a portable
version of our technology

54:00.083 --> 54:02.083
to zip out of existence
right in front of me.

54:02.125 --> 54:04.041
Oh, and this was
right after he told me

54:04.083 --> 54:06.291
that you're going
to murder the world.

54:06.333 --> 54:08.875
And my left eyelid has not
stopped fucking twitching since.

54:08.916 --> 54:11.000
- He said I was
gonna kill people?

54:11.041 --> 54:11.791
Are you sure?

54:11.833 --> 54:13.000
- Yes, I'm fucking sure!

54:14.583 --> 54:17.916
He said that you and
Cicero did something,

54:17.958 --> 54:19.791
and worlds are disappearing.

54:19.833 --> 54:21.708
As in more than one.

54:21.750 --> 54:24.250
- Could we have caused a
decimating ripple in space time?

54:25.708 --> 54:27.291
How do we know this guy knows
what he's talking about?

54:27.333 --> 54:28.458
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:28.500 --> 54:30.083
Let's question the
credibility of the man

54:30.125 --> 54:32.375
who conjured a portal
right in front of me.

54:32.416 --> 54:34.583
Oh also, forgot to tel you.

54:34.625 --> 54:36.291
I also found in
Lennon's rock garden,

54:36.333 --> 54:37.916
because that makes sense.

54:37.958 --> 54:39.708
There was a stack
of Cicero papers

54:39.750 --> 54:41.958
with the design for our
particle accelerator,

54:42.000 --> 54:44.250
and a blueprint for your house.

54:44.291 --> 54:45.041
- You serious?

54:45.083 --> 54:47.250
- Yes I'm fucking serious.

54:47.291 --> 54:48.083
- Damn it.

54:49.666 --> 54:51.041
- I thought we'd
have enough time,

54:51.083 --> 54:53.708
but apparently
they already know.

54:53.750 --> 54:55.125
- A portable doorway.

54:55.166 --> 54:56.166
- Yeah, it was like.

54:57.500 --> 54:59.416
Like this light stick he
just tossed on the ground,

54:59.458 --> 55:02.250
and there was the door,
and then there wasn't.

55:03.416 --> 55:05.291
I tried to pick it
up, but it was cold,

55:05.333 --> 55:07.041
and then it was just gone.

55:08.458 --> 55:10.875
Scott, when it was open,
it was just like ours.

55:12.083 --> 55:13.583
I think a little pee came out.

55:13.625 --> 55:15.791
- The other Scott
said that Cicero was--

55:15.833 --> 55:16.583
- Wait, wait, what?

55:16.625 --> 55:17.375
What?
Wait.

55:17.416 --> 55:18.166
Scott!

55:18.208 --> 55:19.208
Scott who?

55:19.250 --> 55:21.583
- Oh yeah, it gets better/worse.

55:21.625 --> 55:24.083
I met a Scott from the other
side when I opened the portal.

55:24.125 --> 55:27.125
Listen, Margail found
a listening device

55:29.708 --> 55:31.750
- They really are
watching us, aren't they?

55:31.791 --> 55:33.958
- We have to go back to work,
and keep up appearances.

55:34.000 --> 55:35.375
- [Vince] We need to slow down.

55:35.416 --> 55:37.083
- Cicero spent over
a billion dollars

55:37.125 --> 55:38.500
getting us to
freeze sick people.

55:38.541 --> 55:40.250
Why would they have any
interest in alternate universes?

55:40.291 --> 55:42.958
- Maybe they're the ones
keeping up appearances.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.541
- Maybe freezing people
and waking them up

55:44.583 --> 55:45.833
in the future is plan B.

55:50.333 --> 55:52.833
- Scott, I need
you to promise me.

55:52.875 --> 55:55.041
Don't open the door
again without me, okay?

55:56.041 --> 55:58.041
Things are clearly
getting out of hand.

55:58.083 --> 55:59.208
- No, agreed.

55:59.250 --> 56:00.750
Cicero's gonna
watch us so closely.

56:00.791 --> 56:03.166
We gotta be extra
careful opening a

56:03.208 --> 56:05.125
beyond space and
time in my garage.

56:06.791 --> 56:09.083
Words I never thought
I'd say out loud.

56:09.125 --> 56:11.375
[Vince chuckling]

56:11.416 --> 56:13.166
Did someone really shoot at you?

56:14.083 --> 56:14.875
- Yep.

56:16.041 --> 56:16.833
- Man.

56:17.958 --> 56:18.750
- Yep.

56:23.791 --> 56:27.000
[car engine whirring]

56:43.916 --> 56:46.708
[Margail sighing]

56:50.458 --> 56:53.458
[suspenseful music]

57:09.916 --> 57:13.583
[remote buzzing and beeping]

57:20.250 --> 57:23.166
[machines buzzing]

57:32.833 --> 57:35.541
[dramatic music]

58:55.083 --> 58:58.083
[suspenseful music]

59:13.083 --> 59:15.291
- [Margail] You came back.

59:17.416 --> 59:19.208
- I wanted to see you.

59:21.208 --> 59:22.208
- Oh, I see.

59:40.916 --> 59:41.708
- I can feel it.

59:50.416 --> 59:51.333
- How soon?

01:00:05.708 --> 01:00:10.000
- Well, day one of pretending
everything's normal, check.

01:00:10.041 --> 01:00:12.125
- Scott, I've been thinking.

01:00:12.166 --> 01:00:13.458
That guy at Lennon's rock garden

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.583
went out of his way
to make a point.

01:00:15.625 --> 01:00:16.791
He could have killed me,

01:00:16.833 --> 01:00:19.458
but instead he decided
to warn me, warn us,

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:20.291
about you.

01:00:23.375 --> 01:00:25.625
- So you don't trust me now?

01:00:25.666 --> 01:00:28.708
- Maybe he didn't mean you, you.

01:00:32.833 --> 01:00:35.083
From here on out, I have to
be present for everything.

01:00:35.125 --> 01:00:36.083
Okay?

01:00:36.125 --> 01:00:37.083
- Yeah, already agreed.

01:00:37.125 --> 01:00:38.500
- Yeah, yeah, I
know, I know, but.

01:00:40.125 --> 01:00:41.208
I'll come back later tonight,

01:00:41.250 --> 01:00:43.041
we'll open it one
last time, and then,

01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:45.041
who knows?

01:00:46.583 --> 01:00:48.958
- You're not saying we sell it?

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:49.791
Shut it down?

01:00:51.375 --> 01:00:53.291
- [Vince] I don't know, man.

01:00:53.333 --> 01:00:55.208
- I don't know either,
Vince, but I know that

01:00:56.458 --> 01:00:57.250
this is our baby.

01:01:01.083 --> 01:01:02.833
All right, well look, I'll
catch you tonight, all right?

01:01:02.875 --> 01:01:04.500
- [Vince] Okay, see you later.
- Be safe.

01:01:07.125 --> 01:01:08.000
- Well, hello.

01:01:16.708 --> 01:01:18.125
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:01:25.083 --> 01:01:28.000
So, I have an idea for a video,

01:01:28.041 --> 01:01:30.083
and I'm gonna go check out
the lighting at the dog park.

01:01:30.125 --> 01:01:32.500
So if it works, I
may be home late.

01:01:32.541 --> 01:01:35.166
- Yeah, just be careful.

01:01:36.083 --> 01:01:37.750
Things are uncertain right now.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.166
- [Margail] I will.

01:01:42.041 --> 01:01:44.166
- Have you noticed
anything new lately?

01:01:44.208 --> 01:01:45.500
- Yeah, that's the thing.

01:01:45.541 --> 01:01:46.708
It's like Vince, Margail
and I are being followed.

01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:48.666
I don't know what to do.

01:01:48.708 --> 01:01:49.625
- How is Margail?

01:01:51.791 --> 01:01:53.041
She's quite the one
to behold, Scott.

01:01:53.083 --> 01:01:54.958
You should hang on to her.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.958
- Scott, I think things are
starting to escalate over here.

01:02:01.916 --> 01:02:03.125
- The love of your life dying

01:02:03.166 --> 01:02:04.750
can really shape
a person, Scott.

01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:11.208
- I'm sorry you had
to experience that.

01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:12.375
- I like you, Scottie.

01:02:13.791 --> 01:02:16.041
This is more contact than
I've had with the others.

01:02:16.083 --> 01:02:19.125
Our relationships have always
been somewhat abbreviated.

01:02:23.041 --> 01:02:25.833
- Scott, I don't know if it
was one of those watchers

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:28.208
from Cicero, or what, but
somebody followed Vince

01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:30.208
and shot at him, and then
disappeared in what he said

01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:33.250
looked like a portable
version of our doorway.

01:02:33.291 --> 01:02:34.166
- Portable?

01:02:36.791 --> 01:02:37.583
Curious.

01:02:39.125 --> 01:02:41.833
- He said something about
other worlds are disappearing.

01:02:43.125 --> 01:02:44.166
- Like mine.

01:02:49.583 --> 01:02:50.375
All the way?

01:02:52.166 --> 01:02:53.208
- I guess.

01:02:54.833 --> 01:02:55.625
- No.

01:02:57.375 --> 01:02:59.625
No, they wouldn't make
that mistake again.

01:02:59.666 --> 01:03:02.166
- Well, says the person
who's met 37 versions of us.

01:03:05.708 --> 01:03:06.750
- You don't keep
very good notes,

01:03:06.791 --> 01:03:09.083
so they can't track you down.

01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:13.166
- No, it's too dangerous to
leave too much information.

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:16.458
Somehow I've always
known just to keep

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:18.166
the important stuff right here.

01:03:19.958 --> 01:03:20.958
Should I be worried?

01:03:22.166 --> 01:03:24.083
About interrogation?

01:03:24.125 --> 01:03:25.666
Will they show aggression?

01:03:25.708 --> 01:03:26.500
- No.

01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:29.333
No, they won't
hurt you, not yet.

01:03:29.375 --> 01:03:31.958
But they will become bolder.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.458
Once they're certain
of your success,

01:03:36.083 --> 01:03:37.375
they'll come out from hiding.

01:03:38.916 --> 01:03:40.458
Any day now.

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:41.250
- Why wait?

01:03:42.958 --> 01:03:45.791
- You can't think of them
as a corporation, Scott.

01:03:45.833 --> 01:03:47.541
That's a false identity.

01:03:47.583 --> 01:03:50.041
A $32 billion fake ID.

01:03:51.916 --> 01:03:54.791
No, the money, stocks,
employees, it's all

01:03:54.833 --> 01:03:56.708
a means to an end.

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:59.291
What they want is to ascend.

01:03:59.333 --> 01:04:00.125
- Ascend?

01:04:01.416 --> 01:04:02.958
What?
To God?

01:04:06.333 --> 01:04:08.875
- They wanna control everything.

01:04:08.916 --> 01:04:11.041
Think of that kind of power.

01:04:11.083 --> 01:04:14.333
If any world doesn't comply,
they just shut 'em off.

01:04:16.541 --> 01:04:17.916
Expel them from existence.

01:04:19.791 --> 01:04:21.291
It's trans-human garbage theory.

01:04:22.208 --> 01:04:24.166
They wanna become one,
physically and spiritually,

01:04:24.208 --> 01:04:25.875
with the universe, with God.

01:04:27.250 --> 01:04:29.041
Turn themselves into cosmos.

01:04:29.083 --> 01:04:30.916
- All of this for
religious fanaticism?

01:04:30.958 --> 01:04:32.000
- Not religion, Scott.

01:04:33.250 --> 01:04:34.916
Science.

01:04:34.958 --> 01:04:36.250
Think about it.

01:04:36.291 --> 01:04:38.583
You can push a button, and
end up in any universe.

01:04:40.083 --> 01:04:42.083
Maybe somewhere down
the line is heaven.

01:04:42.958 --> 01:04:43.750
Or hell.

01:04:45.625 --> 01:04:49.458
Make no mistake, they'll
come out from hiding.

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:50.875
They'll make themselves known,

01:04:50.916 --> 01:04:52.833
and they will manipulate
every Scott in every universe

01:04:52.875 --> 01:04:54.166
'til they get what they want.

01:04:56.083 --> 01:04:57.125
Right now that's you.

01:05:04.416 --> 01:05:06.166
- [Scott] I think
I'm gonna be sick.

01:05:09.625 --> 01:05:10.833
- Bet you feel like
you just got off

01:05:10.875 --> 01:05:12.666
the Witch's Wheel
at the county fair.

01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:16.958
- You felt it.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.083
- That's the doorway.

01:05:19.458 --> 01:05:21.583
The gravity has its effects,
you'll get used to it.

01:05:28.916 --> 01:05:30.833
- Scott, I hope you
understand if after tonight

01:05:30.875 --> 01:05:32.916
I choose not to pursue
this any further.

01:05:39.625 --> 01:05:42.833
[tense beating music]

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:04.000
- He can't keep her from me.

01:06:06.958 --> 01:06:09.375
I hope you understand if I
won't pursue it any further.

01:06:09.416 --> 01:06:11.708
[yelling]

01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:14.416
[boxes rustling]

01:06:26.375 --> 01:06:27.125
- [Vince] Hey.

01:06:30.625 --> 01:06:31.416
Are you sure?

01:06:33.041 --> 01:06:34.291
- One more time.

01:06:34.333 --> 01:06:36.708
Collect any final data we can.

01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:37.500
- And then?

01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:47.625
Where is he?

01:06:47.666 --> 01:06:48.875
- He's usually waiting.

01:06:50.125 --> 01:06:51.125
- That's comforting.

01:06:55.041 --> 01:06:55.833
- Scott!

01:07:00.583 --> 01:07:01.375
Let's go.

01:07:02.375 --> 01:07:04.083
- Whoa, Scott, hang on.

01:07:07.083 --> 01:07:08.833
Are you sure you wanna
sneak in like this?

01:07:08.875 --> 01:07:09.666
Is it safe?

01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:11.541
- [Scott] It's not
the first house

01:07:11.583 --> 01:07:12.583
we've broken into this week.

01:07:12.625 --> 01:07:15.041
- Yeah, and someone
died that time.

01:07:15.083 --> 01:07:16.375
Sort of.

01:07:16.416 --> 01:07:18.250
- You're just mad 'cause
we didn't find dinosaurs.

01:07:18.291 --> 01:07:19.500
Where is he?

01:07:19.541 --> 01:07:21.791
- [Vince] He's like you,
but really disorganized.

01:07:22.875 --> 01:07:23.666
- [Scott] Scott?

01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:27.458
- I'm starting to have a
bad feeling about this.

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:28.750
- You know scientists
achieve greatness

01:07:28.791 --> 01:07:30.916
at their own
personal risk, right?

01:07:30.958 --> 01:07:32.666
They're willing to sacrifice.

01:07:32.708 --> 01:07:34.958
- I let you go first, didn't I?

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.083
- You're in another dimension.

01:07:36.125 --> 01:07:37.208
Aren't you at least
a little excited?

01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:45.958
[boxes rustling]

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.708
- Exciting isn't the word I
would choose to describe it.

01:07:50.083 --> 01:07:51.125
What did he tell
you about Margail?

01:07:51.166 --> 01:07:52.583
His Margail from this side?

01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:56.291
- [Scott] She died when
they were teenagers.

01:08:03.083 --> 01:08:04.083
- This is our photo.

01:08:05.250 --> 01:08:07.291
This was taken two years ago.

01:08:07.333 --> 01:08:08.666
- What did he say about her?

01:08:08.708 --> 01:08:11.000
What exactly did he tell you?

01:08:11.041 --> 01:08:11.791
- [Scott] What?

01:08:11.833 --> 01:08:12.833
- What did he say?

01:08:16.416 --> 01:08:18.250
- He said she got sick and died

01:08:18.291 --> 01:08:20.207
when they were teenagers, Vince.

01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:22.041
- Nothing specific?
Sick from what?

01:08:22.082 --> 01:08:23.166
- I didn't ask.

01:08:25.707 --> 01:08:28.375
[boxes rustling]

01:08:32.291 --> 01:08:33.375
- But why would he have this

01:08:33.416 --> 01:08:36.000
if she died years
before it was taken?

01:08:36.041 --> 01:08:37.250
- [Vince] Because he lied.

01:08:50.166 --> 01:08:52.332
- There must 40 or 50
cryonic batteries in here.

01:08:52.375 --> 01:08:54.125
- My guess would be 36.

01:08:55.916 --> 01:08:57.416
- Well, Cicero doesn't
even have this many.

01:08:57.457 --> 01:08:58.666
How could he have this?

01:08:58.707 --> 01:08:59.916
- We need to go.

01:08:59.957 --> 01:09:00.750
Now.

01:09:03.166 --> 01:09:05.291
[box rustling]

01:09:05.332 --> 01:09:06.707
- [Scott] They're all dead.

01:09:06.750 --> 01:09:07.500
- Come on!

01:09:08.541 --> 01:09:10.375
Scott, come on.

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:30.666
- What was that?

01:09:30.707 --> 01:09:32.375
And why would he
lie about Margail?

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.416
- It's not safe
to go back there.

01:09:35.457 --> 01:09:37.082
- They're your
coordinates, Vince.

01:09:37.125 --> 01:09:39.875
- I know!

01:09:39.916 --> 01:09:41.082
I know.

01:09:44.625 --> 01:09:48.000
- Why do I feel like there's
something more to this?

01:10:22.083 --> 01:10:22.833
- [Margail] Hey.

01:10:22.875 --> 01:10:24.458
You still up, babers?

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:25.291
- Yeah.

01:10:28.791 --> 01:10:31.666
- [Margail] What are you doing?

01:10:31.708 --> 01:10:32.875
- I'm just thinking.

01:10:32.916 --> 01:10:33.958
How was the shoot?

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:34.750
- It was great.

01:10:36.083 --> 01:10:36.875
You okay?

01:10:38.083 --> 01:10:39.916
- Yeah, yeah.

01:10:39.958 --> 01:10:40.958
- You coming to bed?

01:10:42.125 --> 01:10:42.958
- [Scott] I'll be
there in a little bit.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:43.791
- Okay.

01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:52.750
[suspenseful music]

01:11:11.166 --> 01:11:14.208
[Scott whistling]

01:11:46.583 --> 01:11:50.041
[Scott humming]

01:11:50.083 --> 01:11:50.875
- Hey, babe!

01:11:54.083 --> 01:11:54.875
How was it?

01:12:00.375 --> 01:12:02.375
Excuse me, ma'am, I think
you're in the wrong house.

01:12:02.416 --> 01:12:04.000
- I'm supposed to
ask you nicely.

01:12:06.791 --> 01:12:10.791
- Ask me what?

01:12:10.833 --> 01:12:12.083
- May I have a cup of sugar?

01:12:15.250 --> 01:12:17.041
- Maybe you should
go to the store.

01:12:19.041 --> 01:12:20.458
- Will you give us what we ask?

01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:24.041
- I don't know what you want.

01:12:24.083 --> 01:12:24.875
- Yes, you do.

01:12:27.958 --> 01:12:30.000
- What happens when
you get what you want?

01:12:30.041 --> 01:12:31.250
- I'll make you a cake.

01:12:35.291 --> 01:12:38.958
- Are you gonna kill me?

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:39.750
[knife thumping]

01:12:39.791 --> 01:12:42.666
[jogger screaming]

01:12:45.541 --> 01:12:48.041
- [Other Scott] Come on, Scott!

01:12:56.166 --> 01:12:57.208
- What are you doing?

01:12:58.833 --> 01:12:59.708
- [Other Scott] Shut up!

01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:01.416
- [Jogger] Oh my god!

01:13:02.666 --> 01:13:05.583
[jogger screaming]

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.166
Release me!

01:13:13.416 --> 01:13:15.125
- Wait your turn, sweetheart.

01:13:16.166 --> 01:13:17.083
- Scott, what are
you doing here?

01:13:17.125 --> 01:13:18.875
- Saving your life.

01:13:18.916 --> 01:13:19.708
She was gonna kill you.

01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:21.416
- You don't know that.

01:13:21.458 --> 01:13:22.750
- Ask her yourself.

01:13:24.041 --> 01:13:26.000
I told you Cicero
was gonna get bolder.

01:13:30.041 --> 01:13:34.250
The question is, which
Cicero does she work for?

01:13:36.833 --> 01:13:38.666
- Scott, she needs
an ambulance, now!

01:13:39.541 --> 01:13:40.791
- No, what she needs

01:13:42.166 --> 01:13:43.000
is salvation.

01:13:46.041 --> 01:13:48.333
Is that what I think it is?

01:13:50.041 --> 01:13:50.875
- No!

01:13:50.916 --> 01:13:51.666
No, no, no, no!

01:13:51.708 --> 01:13:52.500
That's mine!

01:13:54.208 --> 01:13:55.708
[sparks buzzing]

01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:56.500
Give it back!

01:13:57.833 --> 01:14:00.375
- I'll take that as a yes.
- What is that thing?

01:14:04.041 --> 01:14:06.000
[sighing]

01:14:09.166 --> 01:14:10.166
- She's not from here.

01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:16.041
And that was only
a matter of time.

01:14:17.666 --> 01:14:21.041
This device is a cluster of
tiny accelerated particles

01:14:21.083 --> 01:14:23.750
acting as a tether when
combined with a foreign object.

01:14:24.958 --> 01:14:26.125
It makes her invisible.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:30.791
- A tether?

01:14:32.583 --> 01:14:34.541
- Follow me here, Scott.

01:14:34.583 --> 01:14:37.583
When a foreign
object, such as her.

01:14:37.625 --> 01:14:39.333
[jogger screaming]

01:14:39.375 --> 01:14:43.125
Has this on, they get to
coexist without an open doorway,

01:14:43.166 --> 01:14:44.291
with no risk of expulsion.

01:14:46.916 --> 01:14:47.708
Thank you.

01:14:49.291 --> 01:14:50.708
- Wait, wait.

01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:53.208
Two of her can exist in our
universe at the same time?

01:14:54.583 --> 01:14:55.958
- Bingo, Scottie.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
My guess is this world
was a one-way ticket.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.666
Cicero needed him to open the
portal again, didn't they?

01:15:10.125 --> 01:15:12.083
- How long have you
been following me?

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.000
- It doesn't matter now.

01:15:16.333 --> 01:15:19.541
All that matters is
that I have this.

01:15:22.083 --> 01:15:23.791
And that doorway
is the only thing

01:15:23.833 --> 01:15:26.875
keeping your horrible
odds of survival at bay.

01:15:26.916 --> 01:15:29.125
Who will the universe expel?

01:15:29.166 --> 01:15:30.416
You?

01:15:30.458 --> 01:15:32.083
Or the other version of
you, out in the world

01:15:32.125 --> 01:15:33.500
and completely
oblivious to the fact

01:15:33.541 --> 01:15:36.541
that they currently have a
50/50 chance of survival.

01:15:39.250 --> 01:15:40.041
How fun.

01:15:42.666 --> 01:15:45.333
[jogger yelling]

01:15:46.791 --> 01:15:47.791
Flip the switch, Scott.

01:15:47.833 --> 01:15:49.041
- No!

01:15:49.083 --> 01:15:50.291
No, no.

01:15:53.083 --> 01:15:54.541
- We can't do that.

01:15:55.666 --> 01:15:58.041
- Flip the switch, Scott,
she's getting away.

01:16:04.125 --> 01:16:04.916
- No.

01:16:06.083 --> 01:16:06.875
No.

01:16:07.833 --> 01:16:09.291
This isn't right, Scott!

01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:14.541
- No!

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:18.791
No!

01:16:29.583 --> 01:16:32.500
[jogger screaming]

01:16:45.083 --> 01:16:46.500
Help me, please!

01:16:47.958 --> 01:16:50.083
- [Scott] You killed her!

01:16:51.166 --> 01:16:53.416
- [Other Scott] I'm
disappointed I you, Scottie.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.125
- Why are you here?

01:16:56.166 --> 01:16:58.375
- Why are any of us here, Scott?

01:16:58.416 --> 01:16:59.791
- I didn't open
that doorway, Scott,

01:16:59.833 --> 01:17:01.666
how did you cross
over on your own?

01:17:01.708 --> 01:17:03.250
- You better take a
kinder tone with me.

01:17:03.291 --> 01:17:04.791
I didn't have to save you.

01:17:04.833 --> 01:17:08.041
- That picture of you and
Margail, you lied to me.

01:17:09.041 --> 01:17:11.000
- That doesn't sound
like gratitude.

01:17:12.375 --> 01:17:13.500
- How are you so calm?

01:17:21.875 --> 01:17:23.416
I'm gonna open this door,

01:17:23.458 --> 01:17:25.875
and you're gonna go back
to your side for good.

01:17:31.041 --> 01:17:32.208
- [Other Scott] Or what?

01:17:32.250 --> 01:17:33.416
- Or I'll rip that new
toy out of your hand

01:17:33.458 --> 01:17:35.041
and we'll see who the
universe likes more.

01:17:37.375 --> 01:17:38.375
- That hurts, Scott.

01:17:40.333 --> 01:17:41.625
But I know you.

01:17:43.833 --> 01:17:45.041
I've known many of you.

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:49.041
And if there's two things
I've learned it's that one,

01:17:49.083 --> 01:17:51.791
you wouldn't risk
expulsion on a coin toss.

01:17:51.833 --> 01:17:54.000
That much pain,
those kind of odds.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.041
And two,

01:17:58.291 --> 01:18:00.583
the universe always chooses me.

01:18:06.333 --> 01:18:07.958
Oh, so you cross
over all willy-nilly,

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000
and now that the shoe's
on the other foot

01:18:09.041 --> 01:18:10.583
you got such a problem, huh?

01:18:10.625 --> 01:18:12.791
- You're not right, Scott.

01:18:12.833 --> 01:18:13.958
You killed that woman.

01:18:15.416 --> 01:18:16.208
You enjoyed it.

01:18:17.416 --> 01:18:18.416
- She deserved it.

01:18:23.083 --> 01:18:25.458
- This is the end for us, Scott.

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:26.583
You're gonna go back over,

01:18:26.625 --> 01:18:28.291
and I'm gonna unmake
this damn machine.

01:18:28.333 --> 01:18:29.958
- No, you won't.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.625
I know you won't,
because I wouldn't.

01:18:32.666 --> 01:18:33.541
- Go.

01:18:41.708 --> 01:18:43.833
- Give Margail my love.

01:18:43.875 --> 01:18:45.500
- You stay the
hell away from her.

01:19:11.875 --> 01:19:13.250
What have we done?

01:19:16.625 --> 01:19:19.541
[birds chirping]

01:19:19.583 --> 01:19:21.500
- Well, this is some
secret agent shit.

01:19:24.583 --> 01:19:26.291
- I don't think
anywhere is safe.

01:19:26.333 --> 01:19:27.333
- Did something happen?

01:19:27.375 --> 01:19:28.541
- Yeah.

01:19:28.583 --> 01:19:30.583
Some woman, I guess
she worked for Cicero,

01:19:30.625 --> 01:19:31.791
came into my house,

01:19:31.833 --> 01:19:34.041
and then other Scott
appeared and killed her.

01:19:34.083 --> 01:19:35.500
- Wait, what?
What?

01:19:36.875 --> 01:19:38.791
- He was able to open the
doorway from his side.

01:19:38.833 --> 01:19:41.000
I don't know how, but
now he's got some device

01:19:41.041 --> 01:19:42.291
that looks like
pedometer that allows him

01:19:42.333 --> 01:19:44.541
to exist on both sides.

01:19:44.583 --> 01:19:46.458
- How did he know she was there?

01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:47.916
The woman?

01:19:47.958 --> 01:19:49.708
How did he know you
were in trouble?

01:19:54.041 --> 01:19:55.083
- He can see us.

01:19:56.708 --> 01:19:58.250
Once the doorway was opened,

01:19:58.291 --> 01:20:00.833
if the two universes share
a tangential connection--

01:20:00.875 --> 01:20:02.375
- Like a connected thread
between each universe?

01:20:02.416 --> 01:20:04.375
- Then he can use the quantum
and gravimetric frequencies

01:20:04.416 --> 01:20:05.625
to generate an image?

01:20:05.666 --> 01:20:07.250
- Like a
trans-dimensional X-ray.

01:20:08.916 --> 01:20:10.125
- God, he could see us.

01:20:11.916 --> 01:20:12.708
Margail!

01:20:32.041 --> 01:20:32.833
- Hey you.

01:20:34.125 --> 01:20:35.500
I got home like 20 minutes
ago, where were you?

01:20:35.541 --> 01:20:37.166
- Doesn't matter
now, you're okay.

01:20:38.458 --> 01:20:39.875
You were right, babe.

01:20:39.916 --> 01:20:41.833
With everything you've been
through, this is my fault.

01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:48.125
I could do this forever.

01:20:49.083 --> 01:20:50.125
- What's gotten into you?

01:20:51.250 --> 01:20:52.750
- I just love you so much.

01:20:52.791 --> 01:20:54.250
- I love you too, Scott.

01:20:55.166 --> 01:20:56.208
- Say it again.

01:20:57.083 --> 01:20:58.250
- I love you, Scott.

01:21:09.708 --> 01:21:12.041
- I could look at you forever.

01:21:12.083 --> 01:21:13.041
- Someone's in a mood.

01:21:13.083 --> 01:21:14.125
- I am.

01:21:15.333 --> 01:21:16.125
I've missed you.

01:21:17.833 --> 01:21:18.833
- Yeah, these last few hours

01:21:18.875 --> 01:21:20.500
have been pretty
rough for me too.

01:21:21.833 --> 01:21:23.458
Are you not going
into work today?

01:21:26.375 --> 01:21:27.750
- What if I never go back?

01:21:30.750 --> 01:21:31.958
- Can you grab my phone for me?

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.041
- Leave it.

01:21:33.083 --> 01:21:34.833
I don't want any interruptions.

01:21:34.875 --> 01:21:35.875
[Margail chuckling]

01:21:35.916 --> 01:21:38.083
- You're acting kinda weird.

01:21:42.041 --> 01:21:44.083
- Why did we never have kids?

01:21:46.875 --> 01:21:48.125
- You want kids?

01:21:48.166 --> 01:21:49.416
Scott, are you okay?

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.625
- Hindsight's always
20/20 I guess.

01:21:55.041 --> 01:21:56.250
- It's not too late.

01:21:56.291 --> 01:21:58.000
We can still talk about
having kids if you want.

01:21:58.041 --> 01:21:59.791
- Run away with me.

01:21:59.833 --> 01:22:01.041
Right now.

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:02.041
- Now?

01:22:02.083 --> 01:22:03.291
- Just go!

01:22:03.333 --> 01:22:06.250
Don't tell anyone, pack
a few things and leave.

01:22:06.291 --> 01:22:07.041
What do you say?

01:22:07.083 --> 01:22:08.583
Be dangerous with me.

01:22:08.625 --> 01:22:10.458
- [Margail] That
sounds outrageous.

01:22:17.166 --> 01:22:19.041
- Well, be outrageous with me.

01:22:23.791 --> 01:22:26.041
- [Margail] But aren't you
ignoring the obvious, Scott?

01:22:28.041 --> 01:22:29.666
- And what's that?

01:22:32.041 --> 01:22:33.541
- That I know my husband,

01:22:33.583 --> 01:22:36.041
and you, asshole, are not him.

01:22:36.083 --> 01:22:39.083
[suspenseful music]

01:22:45.666 --> 01:22:47.250
- I know this is
out of the blue.

01:22:49.083 --> 01:22:50.875
I guess it's a
little weird, huh?

01:22:51.958 --> 01:22:53.416
I just been thinking
so much lately about--

01:22:53.458 --> 01:22:54.750
- No, no, no, sorry.

01:23:06.083 --> 01:23:08.375
Do not move any
closer, I swear to God.

01:23:10.208 --> 01:23:11.000
Don't!

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.958
- What are you doing?

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.208
Babe, it's me.

01:23:20.541 --> 01:23:23.250
I know this is spontaneous,
but we don't have to live

01:23:23.291 --> 01:23:26.041
every part of our lives
according to some detailed plan.

01:23:27.375 --> 01:23:29.500
We can just get away!

01:23:29.541 --> 01:23:30.666
- So is that your plan?

01:23:30.708 --> 01:23:32.500
You wanna just get
away, and play house?

01:23:33.458 --> 01:23:34.250
- Yes.

01:23:36.875 --> 01:23:37.625
We need this.

01:23:37.666 --> 01:23:38.916
- Don't come any closer!

01:23:47.458 --> 01:23:50.041
- You know you're
really starting to

01:23:50.083 --> 01:23:52.916
- Let's see how well you do
with a knife in your chest.

01:23:55.333 --> 01:23:56.333
- Is that your plan?

01:23:58.083 --> 01:23:59.208
Think this is a movie?

01:24:01.166 --> 01:24:03.625
If you wanna stab me, you
gotta do it right here.

01:24:03.666 --> 01:24:04.500
Between the ribs.

01:24:05.708 --> 01:24:07.000
And you better kill me
with the first blow,

01:24:07.041 --> 01:24:10.291
'cause if you don't, I'm
liable to get very angry!

01:24:13.041 --> 01:24:15.416
- [Scott] Margail!

01:24:15.458 --> 01:24:18.791
[other Scott groaning]

01:24:19.875 --> 01:24:21.333
- [Vince] Oh, shit.

01:24:27.041 --> 01:24:28.708
- That's the sternum!

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.041
Hey, Scott.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.416
I was just talking to our wife.

01:24:35.208 --> 01:24:36.000
Oh.

01:24:37.541 --> 01:24:39.000
Hi Vincent

01:24:39.041 --> 01:24:40.000
- Hello Scott.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.166
- It's you, isn't it?

01:24:44.208 --> 01:24:45.666
- I should say the same to you.

01:24:46.750 --> 01:24:47.666
- Surprise.

01:24:48.708 --> 01:24:50.125
- What's he talking
about, Vince?

01:24:50.166 --> 01:24:52.125
- It's what I was afraid of.

01:24:52.166 --> 01:24:53.625
- Afraid of getting caught.

01:24:55.458 --> 01:24:57.041
Tell me Vince,

01:24:57.083 --> 01:24:58.750
did you even consider the
life of the other Vincent

01:24:58.791 --> 01:25:00.125
who really lived here?

01:25:00.166 --> 01:25:02.083
Or was that an
equitable risk for you?

01:25:02.125 --> 01:25:03.125
- [Scott] Vince?

01:25:04.458 --> 01:25:06.208
- He's not your Vincent.

01:25:08.375 --> 01:25:09.291
- [Scott] How long?

01:25:10.583 --> 01:25:11.458
- Two years.

01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:12.958
I'm sorry, Scott.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.041
- Vincent!

01:25:14.083 --> 01:25:15.166
- I did what I had
to do to survive.

01:25:15.208 --> 01:25:18.208
He killed everyone at Cicero.

01:25:18.250 --> 01:25:20.750
He would have killed me
too if I hadn't escaped.

01:25:20.791 --> 01:25:23.250
- You lied to us for two years?

01:25:25.541 --> 01:25:26.666
You led us to him!

01:25:26.708 --> 01:25:27.541
- No, Scott!

01:25:28.583 --> 01:25:30.625
- We used your coordinates.

01:25:30.666 --> 01:25:32.333
- Scott, you're my friend,
that's why I stayed.

01:25:32.375 --> 01:25:34.000
I never thought
he would find us.

01:25:35.541 --> 01:25:37.041
And those coordinates,
that wasn't his world.

01:25:37.083 --> 01:25:39.000
It's just where he was hiding.

01:25:39.041 --> 01:25:40.500
- Wasn't your world, either.

01:25:46.916 --> 01:25:48.791
- Scott, he killed Margail.

01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:55.125
- I should have killed you
while I had the chance!

01:25:55.166 --> 01:25:56.791
- You're mad.

01:25:56.833 --> 01:25:58.208
- No, you let this happen.

01:25:59.750 --> 01:26:02.125
You could have dismantled that
portal at any time, but no!

01:26:02.166 --> 01:26:03.291
You were curious.

01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:05.291
Me?

01:26:06.166 --> 01:26:08.125
I've done this 36 times.

01:26:08.166 --> 01:26:11.375
36 bright-eyed, curious Scotts
have all come to see me!

01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:14.875
You know what I did each time?

01:26:17.041 --> 01:26:17.833
I smiled.

01:26:19.333 --> 01:26:20.166
I conversed.

01:26:22.416 --> 01:26:23.625
And then I killed every
single one of 'em,

01:26:23.666 --> 01:26:25.416
and took their stupid batteries.

01:26:27.166 --> 01:26:29.333
It's an annoyingly
limited resource, Vince.

01:26:31.125 --> 01:26:33.000
And then I would travel
from doorway to doorway

01:26:33.041 --> 01:26:36.041
looking for one where my
Margail was still alive.

01:26:39.416 --> 01:26:41.125
But then all the power died.

01:26:41.166 --> 01:26:42.583
I wasn't hiding, Vince.

01:26:47.833 --> 01:26:48.625
I was stuck.

01:26:51.166 --> 01:26:52.166
So I decided to wait

01:26:53.666 --> 01:26:56.208
for another powder-white,
curious Scott to come see me.

01:26:58.750 --> 01:27:01.000
But you gave me something
so much more valuable.

01:27:02.416 --> 01:27:06.500
You gave me a world where not
only is my love still alive,

01:27:08.333 --> 01:27:09.250
but she loves me.

01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:17.791
[groaning]

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Oh girl.

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:25.500
I think you might have hit
something important after all.

01:27:26.875 --> 01:27:29.541
- How many people have you
killed since I ran from you?

01:27:31.083 --> 01:27:34.166
- Only myself, over and over.

01:27:34.208 --> 01:27:35.250
- No.

01:27:35.291 --> 01:27:36.583
Someone warned us.

01:27:38.541 --> 01:27:41.166
- That's what it meant.

01:27:41.208 --> 01:27:45.041
You've been changing
constants in every universe,

01:27:45.083 --> 01:27:46.750
and leaving a trail
of dead worlds.

01:27:48.333 --> 01:27:49.125
- No.

01:27:50.333 --> 01:27:51.125
Don't you get it, Scott?

01:27:52.125 --> 01:27:53.166
It doesn't matter.

01:27:54.625 --> 01:27:56.041
None of it matters!

01:27:58.166 --> 01:28:01.708
You wanna talk
about dead worlds?

01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:02.666
Look at me!

01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:06.000
My world is dead!

01:28:13.208 --> 01:28:15.125
Why did I deserve that?

01:28:17.208 --> 01:28:20.625
Why does your life
get to be so perfect?

01:28:23.125 --> 01:28:24.916
- We need to get him
back to his universe now,

01:28:24.958 --> 01:28:26.083
and shut it down for good.

01:28:30.416 --> 01:28:32.000
- I think that's
probably enough.

01:28:33.791 --> 01:28:36.041
- Shit, I should've
saw that coming.

01:28:36.083 --> 01:28:37.458
- Let's take a walk, shall we?

01:28:49.958 --> 01:28:52.958
[suspenseful music]

01:28:59.250 --> 01:29:00.583
Roll call, everyone here?

01:29:01.916 --> 01:29:02.708
Good.

01:29:04.583 --> 01:29:05.375
You know, Scott.

01:29:07.041 --> 01:29:08.041
Margail saved your life.

01:29:09.208 --> 01:29:11.708
That first night you
came into my world,

01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:13.000
I would have killed you.

01:29:14.416 --> 01:29:16.750
But you said something
intriguing, you said, "My wife."

01:29:18.125 --> 01:29:19.583
That's when I decided to watch.

01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:21.500
To learn.

01:29:25.166 --> 01:29:27.041
- You wanted to replace me?

01:29:27.083 --> 01:29:28.500
- [Other Scott]
It's not too late.

01:29:28.541 --> 01:29:30.041
- I would rather die.

01:29:35.125 --> 01:29:37.083
- Everyone's a critic, Vince.

01:29:37.125 --> 01:29:39.083
- What are you going
to do, asshole?

01:29:39.125 --> 01:29:40.458
- Oh yeah, 'cause
I'm the one who lied

01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:42.041
to my friend for
two years, right?

01:29:42.083 --> 01:29:43.041
- You're a psychopath.

01:29:43.083 --> 01:29:44.625
- It's neither here nor there.

01:29:44.666 --> 01:29:45.916
- Story of our lives.

01:29:45.958 --> 01:29:47.958
- And I suppose I'll go
back to my adopted world

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.958
at the 4.994 and
a bunch of zeroes.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.041
Yada, yada.

01:29:53.375 --> 01:29:56.041
Seems to be a constant
among many Scott's.

01:29:57.750 --> 01:29:59.125
So I think I belong there.

01:30:01.916 --> 01:30:03.791
And I will find
you again, Margail.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.458
And next time it'll be perfect.

01:30:09.666 --> 01:30:10.583
On your knees.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:12.791
Now.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.208
Get down on your knees!

01:30:17.583 --> 01:30:18.375
Now!

01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:24.166
- I won't let you hurt her.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.458
- Brave words for a dead man.

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:33.791
[punch smacking]

01:30:33.833 --> 01:30:35.666
[Margail screaming]

01:30:35.708 --> 01:30:39.000
[banging and thudding]

01:30:45.208 --> 01:30:46.458
I should kill you right now!

01:30:57.375 --> 01:30:59.125
You know, Margail.

01:30:59.166 --> 01:31:01.458
I don't know why you
love him so much.

01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:02.291
He's a prick.

01:31:03.458 --> 01:31:05.250
Why don't you love me?

01:31:05.291 --> 01:31:06.083
- Scott.

01:31:07.708 --> 01:31:09.083
Just give me the gun.

01:31:09.125 --> 01:31:10.250
Give me the gun, baby.

01:31:11.583 --> 01:31:14.000
We can go somewhere together
and talk about this.

01:31:18.250 --> 01:31:20.250
- You'll do that for me?

01:31:21.541 --> 01:31:23.958
You'll give me another chance?

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.458
- I was too quick to
judge, I see that now.

01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:30.375
Just let me have the gun
before someone else gets hurt.

01:31:33.125 --> 01:31:35.083
I'll go with you
wherever you want.

01:31:42.125 --> 01:31:43.333
[Margail yelling]

01:31:43.375 --> 01:31:46.125
- Did you really think
I would fall for that?

01:31:49.791 --> 01:31:51.125
A for effort, though.

01:31:51.166 --> 01:31:52.208
- Scott.

01:31:53.083 --> 01:31:54.833
How do scientists
achieve greatness?

01:31:56.166 --> 01:31:56.958
Sacrifice.

01:31:58.833 --> 01:32:01.041
- [Scott] Vince, no!

01:32:01.083 --> 01:32:03.458
[tense music]

01:32:06.041 --> 01:32:08.000
[yelling]

01:32:11.250 --> 01:32:14.041
[remote clicking]

01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:28.833
- Who will it be, Scott?

01:32:28.875 --> 01:32:30.375
Who will the universe expel?

01:32:35.083 --> 01:32:36.875
Let go, I can't hang on.

01:32:40.458 --> 01:32:42.083
- This is my world, Scott.

01:32:42.125 --> 01:32:44.083
- I knew you were special.

01:32:50.458 --> 01:32:53.000
- I've been waiting for
you for a very long time.

01:32:54.708 --> 01:32:56.083
Your trail of death ends here.

01:32:57.166 --> 01:33:00.083
[knife thudding]

01:33:11.250 --> 01:33:14.041
Listen to me very carefully.

01:33:14.083 --> 01:33:15.708
If, when that doorway closes,

01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:18.458
the universe decides to
expel him instead of you,

01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:24.416
take that thing,
destroy it, burn it.

01:33:24.458 --> 01:33:26.041
I don't care, just
get rid of it.

01:33:29.083 --> 01:33:29.875
- Wait!

01:33:33.083 --> 01:33:36.208
There's so many of us
out there, what can I do?

01:33:39.083 --> 01:33:40.000
- The right thing.

01:33:42.833 --> 01:33:45.125
I'm taking care of the
ones who don't listen.

01:33:46.083 --> 01:33:47.500
You're different, Scott.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.875
Do as I say and
destroy that thing,

01:33:54.958 --> 01:33:56.833
or I'll come back
and kill you myself.

01:33:59.125 --> 01:34:00.833
I'll always love
you, sweetheart.

01:34:00.875 --> 01:34:01.666
- Okay.

01:34:17.125 --> 01:34:17.916
- Scott?

01:34:20.625 --> 01:34:22.250
- Don't be me.

01:34:22.291 --> 01:34:24.625
Come on, don't be me.

01:34:24.666 --> 01:34:25.458
- Scott.

01:34:27.625 --> 01:34:29.208
Are you okay, Scott?

01:34:30.875 --> 01:34:32.500
- Don't be me.

01:34:32.541 --> 01:34:33.541
Don't be me!

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.750
- Scott, are you okay?

01:34:42.791 --> 01:34:44.000
- Don't be me.

01:35:05.916 --> 01:35:08.875
Guess who just
dismantled the portal.

01:35:08.916 --> 01:35:11.375
Tell your people to stay
the hell away from me.

01:35:11.416 --> 01:35:12.208
And you.

01:35:13.291 --> 01:35:15.166
Take whatever universe
you came from,

01:35:15.208 --> 01:35:16.958
and shove it up your ass.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.208
- We can't stay here.

01:35:18.250 --> 01:35:19.750
- Wait, Scott!

01:35:19.791 --> 01:35:21.208
Wait!

01:35:21.250 --> 01:35:24.125
If you rebuild it, we can
give you anything you want.

01:35:32.416 --> 01:35:35.083
[wind gusting]

01:35:51.041 --> 01:35:54.583
[Vincent gasping]

01:35:54.625 --> 01:35:57.125
[upbeat music]

01:36:44.208 --> 01:36:45.000
- Shit.

01:36:47.166 --> 01:36:47.958
- We don't have time for this.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.125
I'm me, you're you.

01:36:49.166 --> 01:36:51.083
All right, get over it.

01:36:53.166 --> 01:36:54.000
- What is this place?

01:36:56.208 --> 01:36:59.833
- It's what every world will
look like if we don't stop it.

01:36:59.875 --> 01:37:01.083
- Stop what?

01:37:01.125 --> 01:37:03.083
- The end of all creation.

01:37:03.125 --> 01:37:04.000
You coming?

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.708
[upbeat music]

01:37:59.291 --> 01:38:02.708
[children laughing]

01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:05.666
[doorbell ringing]

01:38:32.666 --> 01:38:33.916
- Next time, girls.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.958
[dramatic music]
