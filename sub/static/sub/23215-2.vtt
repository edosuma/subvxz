WEBVTT

00:01.980 --> 00:03.213
Benji.

00:03.560 --> 00:05.115
Hey there.

00:05.407 --> 00:07.242
You've been sitting like that
for five hours.

00:07.267 --> 00:09.167
Should we do a quick bed sore check?

00:10.346 --> 00:12.237
Okay, I saw your Instagram post

00:12.272 --> 00:15.813
of a picture of an aquarium
with the #dreams, #oneday

00:15.838 --> 00:18.905
and should we talk about this?

00:19.346 --> 00:22.051
I'm manifesting my fish tank
dreams on social media, okay?

00:22.075 --> 00:23.964
Just leave me alone, please.

00:24.638 --> 00:27.352
Okay... look at me.

00:27.669 --> 00:29.254
You're obviously depressed, okay?

00:29.289 --> 00:31.868
You're only eating salads,
you're posting aquariums

00:31.893 --> 00:34.556
on Instagram, and as your
unofficial legal guardian,

00:34.581 --> 00:36.847
I cannot in good conscience
leave you here.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.793
Esther, those are turbo snails.

00:38.818 --> 00:39.980
They don't talk back.

00:40.005 --> 00:42.281
They clean up after themselves.
They don't salad shame.

00:42.306 --> 00:44.527
That's what I'm looking for right
now in terms of friendship.

00:44.552 --> 00:48.877
Okay, speaking of
friendship, one quick sec.

00:49.385 --> 00:51.620
Happy birthday! Whoo!

00:53.937 --> 00:55.424
Happy birthday, Benji.

00:55.453 --> 00:57.319
It's your birthday!
Of course I remembered.

00:57.344 --> 00:59.743
You thought I forgot. Look, get up.

01:00.084 --> 01:01.244
We gotta do something. Get up.

01:01.304 --> 01:03.906
- You can't just sit here. Get up.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:04.911 --> 01:06.011
No.

01:06.036 --> 01:07.969
Look, man, I'm burnt out
on Benihana birthdays.

01:07.994 --> 01:09.582
They throw the shrimp at me.
I can't catch it.

01:09.607 --> 01:11.507
I have no neck dexterity. It's tough.

01:11.532 --> 01:13.814
No, this ain't no
Benihana birthday, Benj.

01:13.878 --> 01:17.233
We have very special plans
because I am opening up

01:17.258 --> 01:20.226
at a show in Berkeley
and there's enough stage time

01:20.398 --> 01:24.168
for my friend, Benji, to
come with and perform, too.

01:24.248 --> 01:26.382
I mean, that sounds fun

01:26.407 --> 01:28.214
but I lost a nug of weed
in my duffle bag

01:28.239 --> 01:30.005
and I think a TSA dog will find it.

01:30.030 --> 01:32.379
We're not flying. This right here

01:32.437 --> 01:35.769
is a birthday road trip!

01:37.704 --> 01:39.233
Road trip all the way to Berkeley?

01:39.258 --> 01:40.439
- Yeah.
- Pass.

01:40.464 --> 01:41.903
You can't pass on a gift, okay?

01:41.928 --> 01:43.319
It's gonna be so much fun.

01:43.344 --> 01:44.858
It's gonna be your first
birthday road trip

01:44.883 --> 01:46.180
and my first anytime road trip.

01:46.277 --> 01:47.387
How have you never been on a road trip?

01:47.412 --> 01:49.012
Isn't that the official vacation

01:49.037 --> 01:50.317
of poor people from the Midwest?

01:50.342 --> 01:52.067
It is, but my parents
always told me that they

01:52.092 --> 01:54.344
did all the good road trips
before I was born.

01:58.235 --> 02:01.436
Well, I'm probably just gonna sit
around all day anyways, so...

02:01.665 --> 02:03.193
might as well have the scenery change?

02:03.218 --> 02:05.668
Yes! Oh, my God,
it's gonna be so much fun.

02:05.696 --> 02:08.697
The music, the snacks,
the secret scary stops.

02:08.722 --> 02:10.268
The punch buggy. No punch backs.

02:10.293 --> 02:12.126
- Did I do that right?
- No.

02:12.151 --> 02:13.417
You're gonna have the best time

02:13.442 --> 02:14.611
because it's your birthday.

02:14.658 --> 02:16.559
And doing a comedy set on your birthday

02:16.584 --> 02:18.859
is the best thing ever 'cause
audiences feel bad for you

02:18.884 --> 02:20.899
and they'll give you
free laughs all night.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.320
Come on, I'm above cheap
happy birthday laughs.

02:23.345 --> 02:25.226
That's the equivalent
of humping a stool on stage.

02:25.251 --> 02:27.219
Well, I personally don't
think you're above anything,

02:27.251 --> 02:28.299
but we could talk about that later.

02:28.324 --> 02:29.950
Do whatever you want. Let's go.

02:29.975 --> 02:31.816
- You have to drive.
- Ugh.

02:31.982 --> 02:34.468
- What?
- You always make me drive, dude.

02:34.493 --> 02:35.888
I know, but think about this.

02:35.949 --> 02:37.467
You are in control.

02:37.494 --> 02:39.833
You're in the literal
driver's seat, all right?

02:40.244 --> 02:42.106
You choose if we live or die.

02:42.131 --> 02:43.585
Your arguments
don't get more convincing

02:43.610 --> 02:45.125
just 'cause you don't stop talking.

02:45.241 --> 02:48.011
You know, we can't even stop
for snacks if we're dead,

02:48.065 --> 02:50.298
so your position is the most important.

02:56.213 --> 02:57.579
Jeff, you're coming?

02:57.604 --> 02:59.604
Hell, yeah, man. Come
on, birthday road trip.

02:59.723 --> 03:02.357
Oh, my God. This is so cool.

03:02.382 --> 03:04.024
- Right?
- Yeah, it looks great.

03:04.074 --> 03:05.634
It's probably gonna cost like 200 bucks

03:05.659 --> 03:08.244
to detail this out, but whatever.

03:08.325 --> 03:10.025
Okay, well, I won't pay that.

03:10.367 --> 03:11.999
So, uh, what's this gig about?

03:12.024 --> 03:14.040
Oh, so I'm headlining a club up there

03:14.065 --> 03:16.731
because I went to Berkeley
and it's alumni weekend.

03:16.860 --> 03:19.579
I'm kind of a UC Berkeley legend.

03:19.696 --> 03:21.478
How can you be a legend?
You dropped out.

03:21.503 --> 03:23.744
Excuse you! I got kicked out

03:23.769 --> 03:25.371
because I pooped on a plate

03:25.396 --> 03:27.230
and put it in the
College Republicans' fridge.

03:27.291 --> 03:29.290
I never paid for a single beer since.

03:29.386 --> 03:31.687
- I like that. Respect, dude.
- Thank you.

03:35.119 --> 03:37.094
Uh, you guys didn't pack any bags.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.919
Oh, um, we pack really light.

03:40.024 --> 03:42.324
So, let's do this.

03:43.383 --> 03:44.920
I would at least bring
sheets or something.

03:44.945 --> 03:47.611
These comedy hotel places are gross

03:47.636 --> 03:49.435
and everything's covered in mono.

03:49.460 --> 03:50.872
- Yeah.
- But it's free.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.794
- Hey, hey, wait a second.
- What's up?

03:52.930 --> 03:55.875
Um, why does he think
we're spending the night?

03:56.173 --> 03:58.540
Oh, my God. I got so distracted

03:58.565 --> 04:00.051
by planning the perfect road trip

04:00.076 --> 04:02.431
that I forgot to type up the itinerary.

04:02.456 --> 04:04.515
Oh, all right, but you did tell him

04:04.614 --> 04:06.652
that we pocketed the money
from the hotel,

04:06.677 --> 04:07.823
we're not staying,
and that we're driving

04:07.848 --> 04:09.815
five hours back tonight, right?

04:10.047 --> 04:11.893
No, I didn't, and it just seems like

04:11.918 --> 04:13.214
a weird time to have
that conversation now.

04:13.239 --> 04:15.127
No, it seems like a great time
to have this conversation.

04:15.152 --> 04:17.019
No, um, here's the thing, Jeff.

04:17.208 --> 04:19.914
Benji's going to have
so much fun on this road trip,

04:19.939 --> 04:22.188
that he isn't even gonna want a hotel

04:22.213 --> 04:24.430
because at this point, a hotel would be

04:24.455 --> 04:27.122
- merely an interruption.
- Huh.

04:27.738 --> 04:29.027
That was really convincing.

04:29.052 --> 04:30.672
The trick is to move your hands a lot.

04:30.697 --> 04:32.562
- Oh.
- All right.

04:32.609 --> 04:35.477
- I got vertigo.
- Let's do it!

04:37.048 --> 04:39.902
Okay, so you guys are
so lucky right now.

04:39.927 --> 04:41.647
I have had this mix forever

04:41.672 --> 04:43.530
and I made it in seventh grade

04:43.600 --> 04:46.216
for our class field trip
to our state capital...

04:46.264 --> 04:50.128
Springfield, and I never...
Well, actually, I couldn't go

04:50.153 --> 04:53.254
because I have, um, I had teen onset

04:53.279 --> 04:54.439
parental attachment disorder.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.178
- Oh.
- Yeah, so please,

04:56.534 --> 04:59.902
get ready!

05:01.000 --> 05:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:14.106 --> 05:15.844
Yes, live through it.

05:19.243 --> 05:21.356
Okay, I'm sorry. This has to stop.
This has to stop.

05:21.381 --> 05:22.486
I'm trying to drive.

05:22.511 --> 05:25.193
You guys, I'm sorry. I made
this mix perfectly timed out

05:25.218 --> 05:27.379
so that we would get
to Powell's Chicken Palace

05:27.404 --> 05:30.045
right on time for early dinner,
which the Dutch call supper.

05:30.070 --> 05:31.171
I bet you didn't know this would be

05:31.196 --> 05:32.907
an educational road trip as well.

05:33.043 --> 05:35.163
I don't think that's true,
but I love your confidence.

05:35.308 --> 05:36.779
Ooh, I've heard of Powell's.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.704
They're supposed to have
the best chicken ever.

05:38.729 --> 05:41.197
I know.
I planned the perfect road trip.

05:41.918 --> 05:44.931
Honestly, we have so many
good things planned.

05:44.956 --> 05:47.098
We're gonna go to an ostrich farm.

05:47.124 --> 05:48.864
- Mm-hmm.
- Which is a little bit scary

05:48.889 --> 05:51.438
but we'll just get a few Instagrams,
and then we'll get out.

05:51.463 --> 05:52.624
We have Dodo's Donuts

05:52.649 --> 05:54.273
which is world-famous donuts...
no big deal.

05:54.298 --> 05:56.704
Honestly, it's an
embarrassment of Richards.

05:56.948 --> 05:58.135
Do you know what you just said?

05:58.160 --> 05:59.808
You just said an
embarrassment of Richards.

05:59.833 --> 06:01.628
No, I said we have
a lot of good options.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.519
Unh-unh, how many Richards?

06:03.544 --> 06:05.453
Yeah, how many Richards
exactly are we talking here?

06:05.478 --> 06:07.082
- You guys.
- Dreyfuss, Petty?

06:07.107 --> 06:09.462
Move on. -Well, speaking
of places we should go,

06:09.487 --> 06:10.860
I heard about this place off the five,

06:10.885 --> 06:12.354
and it has a banana split

06:12.379 --> 06:14.002
where they use
banana ice cream with it.

06:14.027 --> 06:15.646
It's bananas on bananas.

06:16.019 --> 06:18.561
I love bananas. -Look, we'll
discuss it later, okay?

06:18.595 --> 06:21.000
Right now I actually have to
pee really, really badly.

06:21.025 --> 06:22.235
Do you have, like, a bottle back there?

06:22.260 --> 06:23.960
- What do you got?
- Let's just hop out

06:23.944 --> 06:25.559
and pop a squat like God intended.

06:26.122 --> 06:28.038
Fine. But let the record show

06:28.063 --> 06:31.030
that this don't count as one
of your birthday presents.

06:32.191 --> 06:33.578
Careful, careful.

06:33.603 --> 06:35.369
These are brand-new New Balances.

06:35.394 --> 06:37.908
Look, man, it's pee.
It goes where it goes.

06:37.968 --> 06:40.420
It's totally a myth that
women can't aim their pee.

06:40.445 --> 06:42.027
Come on. You know what I was thinking?

06:42.052 --> 06:44.219
Tomorrow if we leave
around 10 a.m. for LA,

06:44.244 --> 06:47.632
we'll catch a really gnarly,
sort of pollution sunset.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.457
Yeah, okay.

06:49.482 --> 06:51.144
Oh, you know what?
He's peeing, you're peeing,

06:51.169 --> 06:52.704
I'm probably dehydrated. I need water.

06:52.729 --> 06:54.259
Okay.

06:55.331 --> 06:56.738
Come on, now, we have to tell him.

06:56.763 --> 06:57.918
He thinks we're spending the night.

06:57.943 --> 07:00.225
- I will murder you.
- Come on,

07:00.250 --> 07:02.135
it's his birthday, for God's sakes.

07:02.179 --> 07:04.880
I'll poison you, and no one
will know that I did it,

07:04.905 --> 07:06.905
and the most you can hope for
is a <i> Dateline</i> special

07:06.930 --> 07:08.437
with a tips hotline at the end.

07:08.519 --> 07:10.465
I'm not afraid of you, Esther.
I'm gonna tell him right now.

07:10.490 --> 07:11.582
- Then we'll see what you do.
- Uh, mm-hmm.

07:11.607 --> 07:12.667
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, what's up, dude?

07:12.692 --> 07:14.069
- Hey.
- I just wanted to say

07:14.094 --> 07:15.694
thanks for bringing me
on this road trip.

07:15.719 --> 07:18.539
It's probably my funnest birthday ever.

07:18.689 --> 07:20.127
Not really a birthday person,

07:20.152 --> 07:22.200
- so I appreciate it.
- Cool.

07:22.225 --> 07:24.637
- Okay, let's ride.
- Hey, I'm still working...

07:24.662 --> 07:27.625
Come on, now. Supposed to
be looking out for me.

07:37.094 --> 07:39.256
I'm so glad you talked me
into getting the fried chicken.

07:39.281 --> 07:40.823
- It's so good.
- Mm-hmm.

07:40.898 --> 07:43.536
Grilled chicken just tastes like
lonely-people food, you know?

07:43.576 --> 07:45.280
Yeah, man. Checking this off your list

07:45.305 --> 07:47.271
is gonna give you a high
you'll never forget.

07:47.296 --> 07:50.576
It's gonna carry you for
weeks, no matter what happens.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.087
Hey.

07:53.124 --> 07:55.124
- Hey.
- Esther, you have to try

07:55.141 --> 07:56.728
this chicken. It's crazy.

07:56.841 --> 08:00.162
Yeah, Jeffrey, can I have
a quick adult chat with you?

08:00.262 --> 08:02.095
Um, seeing as I'm the only adult here,

08:02.131 --> 08:03.856
- I respectfully decline.
- Mm-hmm,

08:03.908 --> 08:05.002
it's birthday surprise related.

08:05.027 --> 08:06.495
- Okay, now.
- So let's go.

08:06.532 --> 08:08.631
-You ain't gotta put your hands on...
all right.

08:09.858 --> 08:10.925
What?

08:10.950 --> 08:13.697
How could you let him eat
fried chicken and drink beer?

08:13.722 --> 08:15.553
He was supposed to get
what he always gets.

08:15.578 --> 08:16.906
Grilled chicken and water.

08:16.931 --> 08:19.069
Esther, it's his birthday, okay?

08:19.094 --> 08:21.053
Not dinner time at a POW camp.

08:21.078 --> 08:22.133
I don't see what the big deal is.

08:22.158 --> 08:23.959
Jeff, if there's one thing you're
supposed to know about Benji,

08:23.984 --> 08:26.184
it's that he always needs to
take a shower after he eats

08:26.209 --> 08:28.598
fried, greasy foods, okay?
The only reason he did that

08:28.623 --> 08:31.281
is because he thinks we have
a hotel to go shower in after.

08:31.306 --> 08:33.239
I don't think even Benji's that crazy.

08:33.369 --> 08:35.363
- See for yourself.
- Okay.

08:36.337 --> 08:38.270
Hey, Benj, I got a great idea.

08:38.313 --> 08:40.447
How about after we leave
this ostrich farm,

08:40.472 --> 08:42.392
we go straight to the show?
Does that sound cool?

08:42.423 --> 08:44.323
Oh, absolutely not.
I have to get to the hotel

08:44.316 --> 08:46.364
and wash off this
fried chicken, you know?

08:46.462 --> 08:48.796
The booze, the fried chicken.
That's my thing to wash it off.

08:48.831 --> 08:50.797
That's right. That's your thing.

08:55.609 --> 08:57.874
- Jeffrey, what's going on here?
- It was her, okay?

08:57.899 --> 08:59.449
It was her.
It was her idea the whole...

08:59.474 --> 09:02.274
It was all Esther,
and I'm like a hostage, man.

09:02.299 --> 09:03.425
I was scared for my life.

09:03.479 --> 09:05.485
Listen, I didn't want
nothing to do with this.

09:05.574 --> 09:08.666
- Jeff, shut up.
- Esther, what's going on here?

09:08.691 --> 09:10.727
Don't make me take away
the Postmates password.

09:10.752 --> 09:14.087
Benji, there is no hotel.

09:14.189 --> 09:16.345
What? There's no long,
steamy shower before the show?

09:16.370 --> 09:18.330
I'm covered in a thick layer
of food grease, guys.

09:18.355 --> 09:20.550
I'm supposed to shower off my mistakes.

09:20.575 --> 09:22.275
This was like 3,000 calories.

09:23.759 --> 09:25.992
But totally worth it, right?

09:26.434 --> 09:27.723
'Cause it was good chicken.

09:27.748 --> 09:29.748
Guys, what did you do to me?

09:36.722 --> 09:39.723
New low. Lying to me on my birthday.

09:39.776 --> 09:41.404
Benji, let me explain, okay?

09:41.429 --> 09:42.668
I didn't wanna see you

09:42.693 --> 09:44.320
wasting away on your birthday

09:44.345 --> 09:47.179
like Miss Havisham's
rotting wedding cake.

09:47.368 --> 09:48.580
What?

09:48.656 --> 09:50.226
Guys, I had mono in junior high

09:50.251 --> 09:51.861
and I read a Dickens book.

09:51.886 --> 09:53.952
- No, you didn't.
- Okay,

09:54.015 --> 09:55.668
I heard someone
make the reference recently

09:55.693 --> 09:57.059
and I wanted to sound cool.

09:57.258 --> 10:00.092
Look, there's no hotel
which means there's no shower.

10:00.194 --> 10:02.822
And if there's no shower,
I can't perform.

10:02.930 --> 10:04.266
You knew this about me.

10:04.291 --> 10:06.443
Yes, and we also knew
that if we told you

10:06.468 --> 10:08.248
that we had no hotel, you
never would've come with us

10:08.273 --> 10:09.287
and up until this point

10:09.312 --> 10:10.983
you've been having the
time of your life.

10:11.125 --> 10:13.070
You have to really ask yourself

10:13.106 --> 10:16.132
have I ruined your day
any more than I usually do?

10:16.163 --> 10:18.129
I feel like the answer is no.

10:18.165 --> 10:20.439
Yeah, you dragged me across California.

10:20.554 --> 10:23.019
Do you have to take a full shower?

10:23.057 --> 10:25.023
Could you just take
a wipe bath and be cool?

10:25.112 --> 10:27.879
No, it can't be a wipe bath.
What am I, French?

10:28.209 --> 10:31.032
Look, my nanny, Marisol
always washed me after meals

10:31.057 --> 10:32.571
and this is my life now.
I need a shower.

10:32.596 --> 10:34.116
I was just trying to be a good friend.

10:34.144 --> 10:36.265
You watched me pack a night bag

10:36.290 --> 10:37.990
knowing I wouldn't even need it.

10:38.152 --> 10:40.393
And Jeffrey, dear, old Jeffrey.

10:40.939 --> 10:42.060
You were in on this.

10:42.085 --> 10:43.693
I expect it from her, but you?

10:43.718 --> 10:44.917
You went to church as a kid.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.278
Yeah, man, but come on,
nobody got hurt.

10:47.305 --> 10:48.437
Let's just move on.

10:48.462 --> 10:49.575
What do you mean no one
got hurt? I'm hurt.

10:49.600 --> 10:50.973
This is me hurt. I'm expressing myself.

10:50.998 --> 10:52.701
- Hi, I'm hurt.
- You need to realize

10:52.726 --> 10:54.526
that there are different
levels of lies, okay?

10:54.551 --> 10:57.322
And all this was was a lie of omission.

10:57.404 --> 10:58.815
That's all the way down here,

10:58.840 --> 11:01.774
and then you've got half-truths, JKs,

11:02.209 --> 11:04.443
big, little lies, little, big lies.

11:04.478 --> 11:06.133
Okay, you can't get
the same amount of mad

11:06.158 --> 11:07.625
for all those. You just can't.

11:07.650 --> 11:09.131
Look, guys, I'm gonna get a fancy hotel

11:09.156 --> 11:11.038
and you can't stay with me
and you can't come in my car.

11:11.078 --> 11:12.387
- We're done.
- Hey, hey, you know what?

11:12.412 --> 11:13.723
If you're looking for
some recommendations

11:13.748 --> 11:15.581
I know a boutique place
real close to here

11:15.606 --> 11:17.298
that has a bocce court in the back.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.680
Every hotel in Berkeley's sold out.

11:21.762 --> 11:24.878
Alumni weekend.

11:25.239 --> 11:26.424
I'm leaving.

11:26.449 --> 11:28.393
Look, there's a gym close to here,

11:28.462 --> 11:30.221
and it's got day passes and everything.

11:30.246 --> 11:31.730
You can take a shower there.

11:31.893 --> 11:33.893
What's the body wash situation
at that gym?

11:35.610 --> 11:37.150
I'll get you body
wash for your birthday.

11:37.175 --> 11:38.994
- Problem solved.
- Fine, let's go.

11:39.040 --> 11:40.099
- Fine.
- Great.

11:40.946 --> 11:42.174
<i>Benji, come on, okay?</i>

11:42.199 --> 11:44.439
You said you were just gonna
shower and then we would go.

11:44.927 --> 11:46.489
I got a day pass.
I'm getting my money's worth.

11:46.514 --> 11:47.820
You should exercise, too.

11:47.922 --> 11:49.426
Cardio is a great stress reliever.

11:49.451 --> 11:51.819
Jeffrey, whose side are you on?

11:52.233 --> 11:54.714
I don't know.
I mean, I don't even care.

11:54.739 --> 11:56.040
I just wanna get to the show,
all right?

11:56.065 --> 11:57.778
I wanna... I wanna end this thing.

11:57.806 --> 11:59.021
And just so you know, Benji,

11:59.046 --> 12:00.209
you took too much time
working out here.

12:00.234 --> 12:01.971
We're not gonna make it
to all our stops.

12:02.029 --> 12:05.196
We're gonna have to make
some really difficult decisions.

12:05.773 --> 12:07.536
It's not my problem, liars.

12:07.569 --> 12:08.735
- Ugh.
- Hey.

12:08.763 --> 12:09.729
Be quick, okay?

12:09.754 --> 12:11.921
And just wash your hot zones.

12:18.626 --> 12:20.592
This is a disaster.

12:20.915 --> 12:22.435
What's up?

12:22.630 --> 12:23.896
Hey, what's up?

12:25.252 --> 12:27.166
You seem down, little buddy.

12:27.488 --> 12:29.554
I'm just, uh, I'm just washing my hair.

12:29.579 --> 12:32.079
I'm okay, man.

12:32.273 --> 12:34.291
Nice try, dude. Don't lie to me.

12:34.361 --> 12:36.061
Okay, I'm a body language expert.

12:36.290 --> 12:37.863
Helps me out in the courtroom.

12:38.538 --> 12:39.845
You new here?

12:40.154 --> 12:41.838
I work out here all the time.
Never seen you.

12:41.883 --> 12:43.049
What's up?

12:43.110 --> 12:45.044
- It's a long story, man.
- Yeah?

12:45.333 --> 12:48.367
Well, I gotta shave up,

12:48.392 --> 12:50.325
so all I got is time.

12:50.464 --> 12:51.643
Hit me.

12:51.693 --> 12:54.660
All right, so it's my birthday, and...

12:54.661 --> 12:56.285
Happy birthday!

12:56.310 --> 13:00.045
Everybody, this man's birthday
is today!

13:00.174 --> 13:02.208
- Whoo!
- Thanks, dude.

13:02.656 --> 13:04.435
Yeah, I'm not usually
a birthday person.

13:04.473 --> 13:06.201
I really don't even care about them.

13:06.334 --> 13:08.914
- Uh-huh.
- My friends invite me on a road trip,

13:08.950 --> 13:10.883
all the way from LA...

13:27.988 --> 13:29.625
So, I don't know. They're dicks.

13:29.646 --> 13:30.952
But maybe I'm overreacting.

13:31.052 --> 13:32.981
No, unh-unh. On your birthday.

13:33.672 --> 13:35.850
This is the one day
you can celebrate you.

13:36.964 --> 13:38.753
Feelings are feelings.

13:39.446 --> 13:43.336
Okay? And that is the realest
thing I've ever told anyone.

13:43.627 --> 13:45.322
Yeah.

13:46.189 --> 13:47.590
- Great.
- I like that.

13:47.615 --> 13:48.758
- Thank you.
- Take it, man.

13:48.783 --> 13:50.098
Happy birthday. That's my gift to you.

13:50.123 --> 13:51.791
Thanks, dude.

13:58.836 --> 14:00.883
I mean, I'm just saying
that no matter what,

14:00.908 --> 14:03.321
going to an ostrich farm
is a more unique experience.

14:03.346 --> 14:05.086
Okay, well, going to Dodo's Donuts

14:05.111 --> 14:07.023
is a more delicious experience.

14:07.167 --> 14:09.572
Plus, Jeff, I googled "ostrich bite"

14:09.597 --> 14:11.498
and what I saw really scared me.

14:11.523 --> 14:13.391
They don't have teeth.
It's just like...

14:13.476 --> 14:14.624
- Like that.
- That hurt.

14:14.649 --> 14:16.357
- Oh.
- Hey, guys, let's go.

14:16.521 --> 14:18.272
Great, we are back on schedule.

14:18.297 --> 14:20.009
We just decided
we're gonna go get donuts.

14:20.034 --> 14:21.800
Actually, there's been
a change in plans.

14:21.869 --> 14:24.548
Decisions now go through me,
the birthday boy.

14:24.702 --> 14:27.536
Just had a great talk
with my new friend,

14:27.743 --> 14:31.579
Muscle Guy, and Muscle Guy
says feelings are feelings,

14:31.604 --> 14:34.097
and I don't feel like getting a donut.

14:34.122 --> 14:36.722
I feel like getting the world's
greatest banana split.

14:36.747 --> 14:39.715
Okay, well, I don't think you
understand how road trips work.

14:39.740 --> 14:41.233
I mean, these things have to be planned

14:41.258 --> 14:42.908
weeks, if not months in advance.

14:42.933 --> 14:44.487
That's cute. That's real cute, Esther.

14:44.512 --> 14:46.822
'Cause I don't think you know
how birthdays work.

14:46.847 --> 14:47.946
I don't think either of you

14:47.971 --> 14:49.871
understand how friendship works.

14:53.701 --> 14:55.667
Come on, man, get some ice cream.

14:55.703 --> 14:57.604
- You love ice cream.
- I'm not really that hungry.

14:57.629 --> 14:59.540
- Thank you.
- Hey, maybe we just

14:59.565 --> 15:03.027
all eat quietly before my
migraine really kicks in.

15:03.297 --> 15:05.007
Just take a bite.

15:05.032 --> 15:06.897
It's the best banana split ever.

15:06.922 --> 15:08.125
I'm fine, okay?

15:08.150 --> 15:09.240
I've actually been reading

15:09.265 --> 15:10.920
all about Bill and Suzy

15:10.945 --> 15:14.013
and how this place was
their dream to open it.

15:14.585 --> 15:17.964
Congratulations, Suzy.

15:18.503 --> 15:22.376
Will you stop acting like
you're so donut horny, okay?

15:22.401 --> 15:24.441
I've seen your vision board.
It's all sugar cookies.

15:24.574 --> 15:25.842
Those are snickerdoodles.

15:25.875 --> 15:27.508
Snickerdoodles are sugar cookies.

15:27.571 --> 15:30.001
They're not. -They're part
of the sugar cookie family.

15:30.081 --> 15:31.647
There's no cookie family.

15:31.734 --> 15:33.787
There is a cookie genus. Yes, there is.

15:33.812 --> 15:35.226
And if you take a sugar cookie,

15:35.251 --> 15:36.771
you put snickerdoodle seasoning on it,

15:36.796 --> 15:38.590
- and then it's a snickerdoodle.
- You mean cinnamon?

15:38.615 --> 15:40.347
- Do you even know?
- I do know.

15:40.424 --> 15:42.080
It's more than cinnamon
to make a snickerdoodle.

15:42.105 --> 15:44.417
Yeah, that's why they're
two different cookies.

15:44.442 --> 15:46.558
It's not just one ingredient
that makes it.

15:46.617 --> 15:49.584
The basis of a snickerdoodle
is sugar cookie.

15:49.609 --> 15:51.542
All right, I'm out.

15:51.694 --> 15:52.827
My Lyft's almost here.

15:52.852 --> 15:54.405
I'm just gonna wait
for Ignacio outside.

15:54.438 --> 15:56.120
- Can I come with you?
- No.

15:56.154 --> 15:57.600
I'm gonna come with you, though.

15:57.695 --> 15:58.733
No!

15:58.789 --> 16:00.755
Look, the two of you
are acting like maniacs,

16:00.780 --> 16:02.112
and I have a show tonight.

16:02.139 --> 16:04.273
And so to you I say, "Peace."

16:06.941 --> 16:08.677
Really dramatic.

16:08.702 --> 16:09.827
You know the only reason he left

16:09.852 --> 16:12.158
is because you're a sociopath, right?

16:12.616 --> 16:14.230
I mean, really? Come on.

16:14.340 --> 16:15.740
If anyone's a sociopath, it's you.

16:15.765 --> 16:17.498
You're the sociopath. You're charming.

16:17.682 --> 16:19.673
Fine, but if I'm a sociopath,

16:19.710 --> 16:23.507
you're a lazy, entitled,
narcissistic loser,

16:23.532 --> 16:25.207
which is way worse.

16:25.235 --> 16:26.678
You know, I was actually having fun

16:26.703 --> 16:28.160
but I should've known
this was all a sham.

16:28.185 --> 16:30.878
You just wanted to use me to
be a driver on your road trip,

16:30.903 --> 16:34.696
and even when it's my birthday...
my freaking birthday,

16:34.721 --> 16:36.137
you still have to have it your way.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.062
That's not true, okay? I wanted to go

16:38.087 --> 16:40.120
to the donut shop because of you.

16:40.156 --> 16:43.124
They have gluten-free donuts
in every flavor imaginable.

16:43.149 --> 16:45.285
It was part of your surprise.

16:45.902 --> 16:47.062
What?

16:47.238 --> 16:48.504
It doesn't matter, okay?

16:48.529 --> 16:51.166
It's too late to go now.
We don't have time.

16:52.683 --> 16:54.606
I didn't realize that was
part of the plan, all right?

16:54.631 --> 16:55.773
Thank you. That's very thoughtful.

16:55.812 --> 16:58.284
Well, happy birthday.

17:00.395 --> 17:02.653
I can't believe Jeff left us.

17:03.099 --> 17:04.358
What a jerk.

17:04.384 --> 17:07.218
Dude, do you realize
what just happened?

17:07.267 --> 17:09.194
Who invited us to a show?

17:09.343 --> 17:11.143
Who found a gym super fast

17:11.167 --> 17:12.528
that already had a day pass ready,

17:12.553 --> 17:14.304
and then... And then who sat there

17:14.329 --> 17:15.773
and watched me eat fried food?

17:16.003 --> 17:17.439
And now he's going to the show

17:17.464 --> 17:18.890
and he thinks we're not going.

17:18.915 --> 17:21.015
Oh, we're going to the show.

17:21.242 --> 17:22.796
Yeah, we're going to the show.

17:22.857 --> 17:24.061
Show him.

17:24.087 --> 17:25.087
I can't believe he tried

17:25.112 --> 17:26.752
to tear us apart like that.

17:27.226 --> 17:29.181
I hope he bombs tonight.

17:29.430 --> 17:31.263
I hope someone heckles him.

17:31.993 --> 17:33.853
I hope two people heckle him.

17:34.033 --> 17:35.855
Hmm, interesting.

17:35.972 --> 17:37.572
I'll be Kissinger. You be Nixon.

17:37.638 --> 17:39.572
I'll be SpongeBob. You be Patrick.

17:39.753 --> 17:41.553
He's Squidward.

17:42.009 --> 17:43.075
Let's go.

17:43.617 --> 17:45.932
Hey, Berkeley, how you doing?

17:45.967 --> 17:47.340
It's so good to see you.

17:47.365 --> 17:50.513
All right, what a nice-looking house.

17:50.538 --> 17:53.272
Now, I gotta tell you
I'm used to, uh, LA houses.

17:53.297 --> 17:54.697
Real sexy, hot houses.

17:54.722 --> 17:57.384
This is not that, but, um,
it's really nice.

17:57.409 --> 17:59.194
This is like a palate cleanser
for my eyes.

17:59.266 --> 18:03.235
Uh, I gotta tell you, uh,
today is my birthday.

18:03.260 --> 18:05.094
- Yeah, happy birthday.
- Yeah.

18:05.119 --> 18:06.562
It's not his birthday.
It's my birthday.

18:06.587 --> 18:08.033
He's stealing it for an easy laugh.

18:08.058 --> 18:09.771
- He's lying.
- Liar.

18:09.796 --> 18:11.577
These are a couple of my friends here.

18:11.602 --> 18:13.423
Uh, these are really nice people.

18:13.448 --> 18:15.269
Thank you so much for showing up.

18:15.336 --> 18:17.966
Anyways, guys, uh,

18:18.052 --> 18:20.429
does anybody else think
that when you were a kid

18:20.454 --> 18:23.422
that all dogs were boys
and all cats were girls?

18:23.497 --> 18:25.138
Right, right, right?

18:25.163 --> 18:27.928
Well, I did, too,
until I started dating this girl

18:27.976 --> 18:29.966
who had a female dog, and so...

18:29.991 --> 18:33.059
I wonder if this dog joke
ends in "bitch" wordplay?

18:33.167 --> 18:34.968
- I wonder.
- Seriously?

18:35.022 --> 18:36.860
No, I don't wonder.
I can finish this joke for you.

18:36.885 --> 18:38.414
- Most of us can.
- Just let it... you know what?

18:38.439 --> 18:40.759
Let's move on. So anyway, I was
talking to my girlfriend...

18:40.909 --> 18:42.500
- No girlfriend.
- You know what, man?

18:42.596 --> 18:44.130
You know what,
I'm not even gonna give you guys

18:44.174 --> 18:46.442
the-the-the fun of doing this to me.

18:46.467 --> 18:48.534
- I'm out.
- Come back, Jeffrey!

18:48.602 --> 18:50.679
- Come on, oh, dude!
- Jeff, come back.

18:50.745 --> 18:52.778
- He's joking.
- Come on, man.

18:52.819 --> 18:54.758
- We're messing with you.
- Jeffrey!

18:54.884 --> 18:57.317
Best birthday gift ever, heckling Jeff.
Thank you.

18:57.404 --> 18:59.505
I knew you'd love road trips.

19:01.944 --> 19:03.944
So?

19:04.212 --> 19:06.120
I mean, it's the best donut I ever had.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.160
- Gluten-free or not.
- Yes!

19:07.185 --> 19:09.020
- It's the best.
- This completes

19:09.058 --> 19:10.223
the perfect road trip.

19:10.453 --> 19:12.152
Except for when Jeff tried to ruin it,

19:12.194 --> 19:15.228
- but what can you do?
- What? Are you serious?

19:15.358 --> 19:18.058
Come on, this is the same crap
you guys always pull

19:18.083 --> 19:19.322
when you get into a fight
with each other.

19:19.347 --> 19:21.295
Neither one of you wants
to admit that you're wrong,

19:21.320 --> 19:23.458
so you end up dumping it all
on a third party.

19:23.756 --> 19:25.770
Come on, dude, what is this
third party stuff, dude?

19:25.826 --> 19:27.167
Me! I'm the third party.

19:27.192 --> 19:28.425
Me, Jeff.

19:28.714 --> 19:30.395
Unbelievable that you would try

19:30.420 --> 19:32.163
to tear us apart right now.

19:32.204 --> 19:34.271
And on my birthday, dude.
That's so bold.

19:34.346 --> 19:36.720
I don't know about bold,
but it's inconsiderate.

19:36.796 --> 19:39.553
You know what? You know
what, you guys are jerks.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.799
You're terrible.
You're terrible people.

19:41.921 --> 19:44.188
We're just teasing you, relax.

19:44.317 --> 19:47.437
Jeff, come on, we're just heckling you.

19:47.462 --> 19:49.003
Everyone knows it makes you stronger.

19:49.028 --> 19:51.376
- Look how strong we are.
- It's very, very funny

19:51.404 --> 19:53.042
how the two you never want to confront

19:53.067 --> 19:55.104
any of your actual problems
with each other.

19:55.154 --> 19:57.054
Oh, my God, this again
with the problems.

19:57.269 --> 19:58.969
Actually, Jeffrey,

19:58.994 --> 20:00.360
we think you're a sociopath.

20:00.686 --> 20:02.653
Well, we don't...
We know you're a sociopath.

20:02.682 --> 20:04.582
Okay, you know what? That's it.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.670
Bye! Bye!

20:06.886 --> 20:08.111
Happy birthday, man.

20:09.715 --> 20:11.015
That was crazy.

20:11.050 --> 20:13.317
Like, straight up, that was so crazy.

20:13.599 --> 20:14.973
I know. He's got problems.

20:14.998 --> 20:16.998
- I feel really bad for him.
- Me too.

20:17.190 --> 20:18.877
And then he's like,
"Confront your problems."

20:18.902 --> 20:20.256
And then we're like, "All
right, here's your problem."

20:20.281 --> 20:22.323
Well, the sad thing is
is that when you act like that

20:22.348 --> 20:23.906
you're never gonna find someone.

20:24.132 --> 20:26.616
You're just always
gonna be by yourself.

20:26.919 --> 20:28.287
Yeah, I know.

20:28.321 --> 20:30.288
It's sad.
