-[Allegra] <i>I need to apologize.</i>

00:15.849 --> 00:17.475
-You're Oliverio Gerard, right?
-Yes.

00:17.559 --> 00:19.436
I know you didn't accept Caterina
at Cocó's request.

00:19.519 --> 00:21.604
-[doorbell rings]
-Come in.

00:21.688 --> 00:23.690
I want you to join my workshop.

00:23.773 --> 00:25.066
-Seriously?
-Yes.

00:40.123 --> 00:41.124
Me.

00:46.421 --> 00:47.964
Thanks for listening to me.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.174
I'm so sorry.

00:49.257 --> 00:51.760
I know. Oliverio came to see me.

00:51.843 --> 00:53.678
And? What did he say?

00:53.762 --> 00:55.555
-He accepted me in the workshop.
-[gasps]

00:55.638 --> 00:57.349
It's not that simple.

00:58.433 --> 01:00.518
I need time to forgive you.

01:01.436 --> 01:02.687
I trusted you,

01:02.771 --> 01:05.940
and I'm afraid to do it again
because we haven't known each other long.

01:06.024 --> 01:08.985
I know,
and you have every right to mistrust me.

01:10.195 --> 01:11.738
But I don't want to lose you.

01:13.281 --> 01:14.282
I feel…

01:16.368 --> 01:18.453
like we have a connection…

01:22.165 --> 01:23.458
that's very strong.

01:24.459 --> 01:26.586
I just need a little time.

01:27.253 --> 01:30.548
Well, I'd better go.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.509
I have to get ready for the audition.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.219
Laura.

01:35.136 --> 01:36.262
I can help you.

01:37.597 --> 01:40.058
Help me rehearse?

01:40.141 --> 01:42.644
Yeah. I know Ellie better than anyone.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.481
I thought you were done with the theater.

01:47.315 --> 01:51.277
I'm done with the theater. But
I'm more done with Greta playing Ellie.

and get the part,

02:19.305 --> 02:20.974
there's something you need to know.

02:21.725 --> 02:26.146
My mom always corrected my stance
when I played Ellie.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.023
Because in that moment,

02:28.106 --> 02:30.525
Ellie isn't the same person
as she was at the beginning.

02:30.608 --> 02:32.152
She's struggling to find herself.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.738
-Of course. Katherine is in her body.
-Exactly.

02:35.363 --> 02:38.616
You need to be aware
of what the character is feeling

02:38.700 --> 02:40.535

02:40.618 --> 02:42.037

to get right

02:56.801 --> 02:58.636
-is the great leap.
-Great leap.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.931
I know. I don't think anyone has ever
done it better than Cocó,

03:02.015 --> 03:05.393
but if you can land it better than Greta,

03:05.477 --> 03:07.270

03:20.075 --> 03:21.868

03:21.951 --> 03:25.330
and thinks that I'm rehearsing
because I want to rejoin the company.

03:25.413 --> 03:26.831

03:26.915 --> 03:29.709
Just one day of not hearing her, one day…

03:29.793 --> 03:32.462
It's the only thing I ask of you.
The only thing.

03:32.545 --> 03:33.797
It's so minor.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.592
Why don't you sleep over?

03:38.510 --> 03:41.096
-No, because I don't know if I can--
-Come on. Why not?

03:41.179 --> 03:42.430
Call home and let them know.

03:42.514 --> 03:45.642
-No, because today I have to--
-Come on, please. You can't say no.

03:45.725 --> 03:48.853
Mom loves you.
With you here, she'll sheathe her claws.

[Greta] You can't deny
that you feel something for me.

03:59.114 --> 04:00.865

04:00.949 --> 04:02.784
You're going to play

04:04.369 --> 04:05.954
I don't want to play anymore.

04:09.624 --> 04:10.625

04:13.712 --> 04:15.463
[laughs] Come on, Marco. I know you.

04:17.841 --> 04:20.093

When I'm here, this is my time.

I don't want you to get hurt. That's all.

04:41.156 --> 04:44.701
-Why do you think I'm going to get hurt?
-I just ask that you trust me.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.828
It's better if you stay away from him.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.330
You're not answering me.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.336
You need to live your own experience.

04:54.419 --> 04:58.048
All I can tell you is that falling in love
with someone from another time

04:58.131 --> 04:59.591
can cause a lot of suffering.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.052
I prefer to risk getting hurt for love

05:02.135 --> 05:04.095
than to suffer
for not acting on what I felt.

-You're putting Marco at risk.

05:09.184 --> 05:11.102
You need to stay away from him.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.788
Yeah. Remember that it's my room too, eh?

I know. But we're finishing up
practicing for the audition.

05:32.457 --> 05:35.293
-Can you come back later?
-I have to scout locations for the short.

05:35.377 --> 05:36.503
-What short?
-Nothing.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.838
Félix is shooting a short
to get into film school.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.674

-It's nothing.

05:43.218 --> 05:45.220

-I could help you.

something new, or can I go now?

when I was little, before I went to bed.

about those travels?

you're going to have to read my novel.

But recently

09:48.755 --> 09:50.048
she had an accident…

09:51.424 --> 09:53.843
and it was the first time
that I felt afraid.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.806
It was horrible.

13:31.686 --> 13:34.814
I don't have a grave.
You don't have a grave. So?

13:36.107 --> 13:39.110
What I'm getting at is that
you have to stop thinking about Marco.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.780
Focus on what happened
with your grandmother.

13:41.863 --> 13:45.200
I was hardly with her on this trip.
I spent the whole time with my mom.

13:47.243 --> 13:50.663
In spite of their differences,
my mom loved Cocó.

13:52.540 --> 13:55.835
Something happened to cause her
to separate from my grandmother for good

13:55.919 --> 13:57.087

14:12.060 --> 14:14.771

some locations for the short.

-If you want to come, we can check out--
-No. I can't.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.943
I have to rehearse to face off with Greta.

14:20.902 --> 14:24.197
I suppose that you can't come
to the makeup demo tomorrow either, right?

14:25.281 --> 14:27.992
If I don't have everything settled,
I can't go out and shoot.

14:28.076 --> 14:29.786
I know. When I have time, we'll do it.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.372
I can't turn it in whenever I want.
I have a deadline.

14:32.455 --> 14:34.040
We're in preproduction now,

14:34.124 --> 14:37.002
and according to my schedule,
we should already be in postproduction.

14:37.585 --> 14:40.255
-I have to go shoot now.
-Félix, try to understand. I can't now--

14:40.338 --> 14:41.881
"I, I, I."

14:41.965 --> 14:44.217
Can you stop thinking about yourself
and what you want?

14:44.300 --> 14:46.136
Well, ask nicely.

14:47.095 --> 14:49.431
It's important to me
to join Eleven O'Clock.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.933
And it's important to me to study film.
Hmm?

14:52.017 --> 14:53.935
If you don't commit to helping me,

14:54.769 --> 14:56.271
I'm going to find another actress.

14:57.814 --> 15:01.109
But you wrote the script with me in mind.
That's what you told me.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.863
Maybe that was my mistake, huh? [scoffs]

to you getting the part of Ellie.

15:30.972 --> 15:33.558
Do you know what I have here? Guess.

15:34.184 --> 15:35.226
I don't know.

15:35.310 --> 15:38.396
I found a recording
of the first staging of <i>Freaky Friday</i>.

15:39.314 --> 15:41.775
-And?
-Cocó was the lead.

15:41.858 --> 15:43.943
You'll see
how she performed the great leap.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.906
Laura's never going to be able to do it.
Not even Caterina managed to.

15:50.075 --> 15:51.117
Very good.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.036
I owe you one.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.997
No. No, you don't owe me anything.

15:57.207 --> 15:58.333
I owe you.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.502
Yeah, I owe you one.

16:01.419 --> 16:05.632
At Caterina's party, you really wanted
to help me, and I didn't listen to you,

16:05.715 --> 16:08.468
and I ended up making the biggest fool
of myself with Diego.

16:08.551 --> 16:10.804
Calm down. Nobody remembers that anymore.

16:10.887 --> 16:14.349
Bárbara. How are you feeling?

16:14.891 --> 16:16.351
Did you come to apologize?

16:17.727 --> 16:21.398
It seemed like you wanted to say something
to Diego at my birthday party.

16:22.524 --> 16:24.818
Do you want to tell me
since I'm his girlfriend?

16:26.986 --> 16:29.155
No, thank you.

16:30.115 --> 16:33.993
But why don't you tell me
how you're feeling

16:34.077 --> 16:38.957

16:39.040 --> 16:40.125

16:40.875 --> 16:41.918
I don't know.

Why don't you ask your friend
who's worked here for years?

The Arcade won't even exist for me
after the opening of <i>Freaky Friday</i>.

is going to be mine.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.982
As sure as you were
when you were up against me and lost?

17:04.065 --> 17:08.319
It's very easy to win when your mom is
the director of the company,

17:08.403 --> 17:10.864
and her dream is to play the lead
with her daughter.

17:11.614 --> 17:14.242

between you and Cocó on opening night?

17:39.267 --> 17:42.645
I don't know what your grandmother told
you, but that's none of your business.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.273
No. What happened between Cocó
and you is my business too.

17:45.357 --> 17:47.067
Why do you never tell me anything?

17:48.026 --> 17:49.611
Because that night I lost everything.

17:50.653 --> 17:51.821
I lost my friend.

17:52.781 --> 17:54.032
I lost my boyfriend.

Where's Laura?

28:15.278 --> 28:17.155
Okay, attention. Attention.

28:17.655 --> 28:20.450
Now Laura and Greta
are going to perform "No More Fear"

28:20.533 --> 28:22.577
without the rest of the company,
so you can relax.

28:22.660 --> 28:23.953
I'm ready.

28:26.289 --> 28:28.625
What about Laura? Where's Laura?

28:28.708 --> 28:31.753
She probably chickened out.
Is the audition canceled?

28:34.214 --> 28:37.258
No. There are still five minutes to go.

28:38.885 --> 28:40.053
Let me out!

28:43.306 --> 28:45.141
[grunts] Hey!

28:45.225 --> 28:47.060
[pounding]

28:52.023 --> 28:53.900
[whispering, indistinct]

28:55.485 --> 28:58.363
-What did you do to Laura?
-Excuse me?

28:58.446 --> 29:00.240
Don't play dumb with me.

29:00.323 --> 29:04.160
Sweetie, don't go around accusing people.

29:04.244 --> 29:06.955
Besides, Greta is 130% innocent.

29:07.664 --> 29:13.503
The one who's some place she shouldn't be
is lost little Laura.

29:13.586 --> 29:15.171
What place? What are you talking about?

29:15.255 --> 29:18.466
No, you misunderstood. You misunderstood.
I never said anything about your place.

29:19.009 --> 29:24.472
What she meant is my place as--
as the lead.

29:36.776 --> 29:37.944
[pounds on door]

29:38.028 --> 29:40.113
Hello! Can anyone hear me?

29:42.198 --> 29:43.658
Laura?

29:44.784 --> 29:45.785
Marco?

29:45.869 --> 29:47.078
Yeah.

29:51.041 --> 29:52.542
Get away from the door!

29:57.839 --> 30:00.216
[indistinct conversations]

30:07.515 --> 30:08.933
Congratulations, Greta.

30:11.144 --> 30:13.396
-The part of Ellie will--
-[Allegra] I'm here!

30:15.357 --> 30:16.399
Where were you?

30:16.483 --> 30:18.735
-I'm sorry. I can explain--
-Save your explanations.

30:18.818 --> 30:21.154
-Go and get changed for the audition.
-What?

30:21.237 --> 30:23.823
-She was late. That's not fair.
-Are you questioning me?

30:24.491 --> 30:25.742
Places, please.

30:32.082 --> 30:34.542
I was thinking about makeup
for a B horror,

30:34.626 --> 30:37.379
something very crude, exaggerated,
like a little bit of--

30:37.462 --> 30:40.590
Okay, little brother, time to disappear.
We need to rehearse.

30:40.674 --> 30:44.469
Yeah. And we have to do the makeup demo
for the lead in my short.

30:45.011 --> 30:46.846
Well. You're going to wear makeup?

30:47.972 --> 30:49.808
We're waiting for Allegra.

30:49.891 --> 30:51.601
Félix, I have to go now.

30:52.102 --> 30:53.103
Already?

30:53.186 --> 30:56.022
I have another shoot. A real one.

30:56.106 --> 30:58.608
One that's paid. Can we reschedule?

30:58.692 --> 31:01.319
-Wait. You told me we would have one day--
-[Alan] Stop.

31:01.403 --> 31:04.906
Stop. What if you make a short
about an invisible girl?

31:06.324 --> 31:07.701
What if I play the part?

31:08.868 --> 31:11.746
I don't know if she's a good actress,
but she has gorgeous skin.

31:11.830 --> 31:13.248
Good genes.

31:13.331 --> 31:16.793
Sorry, Sofía,
but I don't think it's going to work.

31:16.876 --> 31:19.379
I wrote the lead for my short
with Allegra in mind.

31:19.462 --> 31:22.132
Is there ever a time
you're not thinking about Allegra?

31:22.215 --> 31:23.591
I can't wait any longer.

31:36.229 --> 31:37.522
Are you that afraid of me?

31:39.691 --> 31:41.693
I'm not afraid of anyone.

31:41.776 --> 31:43.778
Then why did you lock me up?

31:44.779 --> 31:46.823
To save you the frustration of losing.

31:47.323 --> 31:49.701
Thank you for your concern.
You're so kind.

31:49.784 --> 31:52.620
But I'm better,
and I'm going to prove it to you now.

31:53.913 --> 31:57.542
This is my future. You have no idea
how much I've sacrificed for this part.

31:57.625 --> 32:01.755
I understand you more than you think.
I'm sacrificing my present to be here.

32:01.838 --> 32:03.840
And I don't intend to miss this chance.

32:04.883 --> 32:10.388
"Absolutely no one could ever imagine

32:10.472 --> 32:15.101
the exhausting feeling
that the lonely and decisive girl

32:15.185 --> 32:17.937
experienced intensely

32:18.021 --> 32:20.273
on that dark night when she met him."

32:21.483 --> 32:24.611
-The idea is very interesting, isn't it?
-[people murmur assent]

32:24.694 --> 32:29.699
But the text is full of adjectives
and adverbs.

32:31.576 --> 32:36.790
If the story is powerful,
you don't need to make it flowery.

32:37.290 --> 32:38.750
Less is more.

32:39.751 --> 32:45.173
You need to know how to choose
and trust in the beauty of simplicity.

32:47.008 --> 32:49.094
Eh? [chuckles]

32:49.177 --> 32:51.137
And this? Cut.

32:55.308 --> 32:57.727
Luckily you promised me
that Caterina would play Ellie, eh?

32:57.811 --> 32:59.145
We'll talk later, Tomás.

32:59.688 --> 33:00.689
Attention.

33:02.065 --> 33:03.066
Greta.

33:03.733 --> 33:04.984
Laura.

33:05.610 --> 33:09.781
This is your chance
to show what you're made of.

33:11.199 --> 33:12.200
Good luck.

Congratulations, Laura.

35:14.280 --> 35:16.783
[exclaims, sighs]

35:20.245 --> 35:23.623
That was incredible. How did you do it?

35:26.084 --> 35:29.254
A magician never reveals her secrets.
[chuckles]

35:30.797 --> 35:33.925
I saw you practicing the lead-up
to the great leap.

35:35.260 --> 35:38.596
The most important thing is
to not lose the symmetry of your hips.

35:38.680 --> 35:40.640
-What are you doing?
-Pay attention.

35:41.725 --> 35:43.435
Every time you move your hips,

35:43.518 --> 35:46.146
you'll see the shine of the clips
reflected in the mirror.

35:47.147 --> 35:50.859
That will let you correct
the stance quickly.

35:51.359 --> 35:52.360
See?

35:53.945 --> 35:57.657
All you have to do is always rehearse
in front of the mirror.

35:57.741 --> 35:58.825
Now, let me see you.

36:07.709 --> 36:09.336
[sings note]

36:09.919 --> 36:11.880
Sorry, Félix. I'm super late.

36:11.963 --> 36:13.548
Only two hours late. No stress.

36:13.631 --> 36:17.802
I know, and I'm so sorry.
But I have good news.

36:19.763 --> 36:21.389
I got the part of Ellie.

36:25.518 --> 36:27.479
So? Aren't you going to say anything?

36:27.562 --> 36:31.441
Yes. You let me down. Again.

36:31.524 --> 36:32.734
I didn't have a choice.

36:32.817 --> 36:36.446
The bracelet took me back to the past.
You know I can't control it.

36:36.529 --> 36:38.698
Allegra, you had more than enough time,

36:38.782 --> 36:41.117
but you decided to do your own thing
like always.

36:41.201 --> 36:42.535
I'm asking you for once

36:42.619 --> 36:46.081
to stop blaming the bracelet and take
responsibility for your own decisions.

36:46.164 --> 36:47.332
You're right.

36:49.626 --> 36:52.045
And the last thing I want to do
is let you down.

36:53.171 --> 36:54.756
You're very important to me.

36:56.132 --> 36:59.135
[sighs] If I'm so important to you,

36:59.219 --> 37:01.346
why are you trying to stay in the past?

[sighs] I already explained
it to you, Félix.

37:03.181 --> 37:05.433
No, wait. This is your time, right?

37:05.517 --> 37:09.145
Your family is here. I'm here.
It's like we don't matter to you.

37:09.229 --> 37:10.772
You're wrong.

37:10.855 --> 37:14.359
You know what? You're right.
I don't feel like arguing with you.

37:18.488 --> 37:19.781

37:20.573 --> 37:22.909
So what happened to you this time?
Tell me.

37:22.992 --> 37:26.871
[sighs] I think what happened
on opening day was no accident.

37:26.955 --> 37:29.541
-It was intentional.
-Why do you think that?

37:29.624 --> 37:30.625
I'll explain it later.

37:30.709 --> 37:33.503
Now we need to go to the theater.
I'm sure we'll find something

37:33.586 --> 37:35.714
that will help me figure out
what happened that night.

37:35.797 --> 37:37.841
Yeah, well, count me out. Hmm?

37:38.967 --> 37:41.386
-Please, Félix. I need you.
-[scoffs]

37:41.469 --> 37:45.098
I needed you too. Hmm?
And you didn't show.

37:45.181 --> 37:48.518
And now I have stuff to do for the short.
Hmm?

38:10.248 --> 38:11.916
What happened here?

38:12.000 --> 38:14.085
That's what I'd like to know.

38:14.169 --> 38:18.173
How on Earth could you leave the Arcade
in the hands of a guy who, of course,

38:18.256 --> 38:21.509
had no better idea than
to bring all his friends to play for free?

38:21.593 --> 38:23.720
I can explain.
I had to go out for a while--

38:23.803 --> 38:26.431
I asked you nicely to not go out.
I asked you nicely to stay.

38:26.514 --> 38:28.433
Look at this place. I had to close it.

38:29.017 --> 38:31.436
Forgive me.
I didn't think they were going to do that.

38:31.519 --> 38:35.023
Honestly, I-- I'll clean up. Don't worry.

38:35.106 --> 38:37.442
I'm going to have to tell your mom
about this, Caterina.

38:37.525 --> 38:40.028
No. Please don't. Not that. Please don't.

38:41.780 --> 38:44.199
-You'd better clean everything.
-Yes.

38:45.575 --> 38:48.578
-[Bárbara] It's not that bad.
-[Greta] Are you kidding? I lost the lead.

38:48.661 --> 38:50.789
Well, don't take it out on me.
It's not my fault!

38:50.872 --> 38:52.082
So shut your mouth.

38:53.750 --> 38:55.001
What happened here?

38:57.962 --> 38:59.506
And what are you laughing about?

39:00.840 --> 39:04.469
I'm happy that Laura will play Ellie.

39:05.178 --> 39:07.972
Then again,
I was sure she was going to beat you.

39:08.682 --> 39:09.683
[sighs]

39:09.766 --> 39:13.103
Look, I don't know
where that girl came from, okay?

39:13.186 --> 39:16.439
But if she thinks she can appear
out of the blue and take my life,

39:16.523 --> 39:17.899
she's very wrong.

39:59.065 --> 40:00.400

I always wanted to say that.

40:18.209 --> 40:20.462
-What are you doing here?
-We'll talk about it later.

40:20.962 --> 40:22.547
-At another time, okay?
-[screams]

40:22.630 --> 40:23.923
-We'd better go!
-Easy, easy.

40:24.007 --> 40:26.259
This is the scene where the hero arrives
and saves his belov--

best friend from the villain.

40:27.969 --> 40:29.429

at the hands of the monster.

That could be a scene too.

We didn't mean to bother you!

-Everything here is mine!
-Who wouldn't want a set of burnt tables?
