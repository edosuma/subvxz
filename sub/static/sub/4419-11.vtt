PLANETARIUM?

03:02.323 --> 03:06.025
I HAVE A BONE DISEASE
WHICH IMPEDES MY ABILITY

03:06.027 --> 03:08.594
TO PRONOUNCE THE "T"

09:39.887 --> 09:41.253
I'M GONNA

09:57.738 --> 10:00.005
WHY "AMERICA'S FUNNIEST
HOME VIDEOS", WHY?

10:00.007 --> 10:03.208
THERE'S ONE WAY TO GET
ANY SENSE OUT OF HIM.

10:03.210 --> 10:06.812
WE'RE GONNA TRY
A MIND-MELD, OKAY?

10:06.814 --> 10:07.813

10:54.628 --> 10:58.730
TO BE WITHOUT THE PLANETARIUM
CAUSES YOU HORRIBLE PAIN.

10:58.732 --> 11:01.700
YOU WANT TO HELP
THE PLANETARIUM THRIVE.

11:01.702 --> 11:04.102
TO NOT DO SO
MAKES YOUR STOMACH ACHE

11:04.104 --> 11:05.637
WITH NEEDLE-LIKE STAB--

11:05.639 --> 11:08.840

14:48.328 --> 14:50.162
DR. ADAMS.

14:50.164 --> 14:50.862

15:02.309 --> 15:06.077
PLANETARIUM ABOUT TO GO

18:40.794 --> 18:41.926
WHERE THE HELL
IS EVERYBODY!

18:41.928 --> 18:44.496
I'M ON TV TONIGHT.
YOU BETTER NOT MISS IT 1

18:44.498 --> 18:47.932
AND THIS
IS "CASIOPEA"

18:47.934 --> 18:49.567
OH, NEATO.

18:49.569 --> 18:52.037
AND NOW, OFFICER,
FROM THIS MOMENT ON

18:52.039 --> 18:55.473
YOU WILL THINK THAT
YOU ARE ELVIS PRESLEY.

18:55.475 --> 18:58.977
TO NOT BE ELVIS WILL
CAUSE YOU GREAT PAIN!

18:58.979 --> 18:59.644
PAIN.

18:59.646 --> 19:02.313
YOU SEE CHILDREN,
THERE'S NO STOPPING ME.

19:02.315 --> 19:04.582
EVEN YOUR HIGHLY
INTELLIGENT POLICEMEN

19:04.584 --> 19:05.884
ARE NO MATCH
FOR ME.

19:05.886 --> 19:07.585
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS?

19:07.587 --> 19:10.288
BECAUSE NOWADAYS
KIDS HAVE COMPUTERS

19:10.290 --> 19:11.823
AND SURROUND SOUND
TELEVISION.

19:11.825 --> 19:14.426
THEY'VE FORGOTTEN
PLANET-ARIUMS,

19:14.428 --> 19:15.927
BUT I'LL MAKE
THEM REMEMBER

19:15.929 --> 19:18.496

19:56.870 --> 19:59.571
( singing like Elvis )

19:59.573 --> 20:02.574
APPARENTLY HE THINKS
HE'S CHARLTON HESTON.

20:02.576 --> 20:04.275
NO, YOU IDIOT.
HE THINKS HE'S ELVIS.

20:04.277 --> 20:08.346

21:02.269 --> 21:04.335
YOU'RE NOT THE KING
OF ROCK AND ROLL.

21:04.337 --> 21:07.005
YOU'RE A FAT STUPID
WORTHLESS POLICEMAN

21:07.007 --> 21:09.040
IN A SMALL TOWN.

21:09.042 --> 21:13.845
