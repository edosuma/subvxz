00:01.769 --> 00:03.043
<i>Previously on</i>
Roswell, New Mexico...

00:03.120 --> 00:06.038
I have a proposition for you.
I can help Charlie

00:06.048 --> 00:08.215
if you can help me
with a little access

00:08.292 --> 00:09.958
to the Roswell
Sheriff's Department.

00:09.969 --> 00:10.959
Who did you tell?

00:11.036 --> 00:12.461
Wyatt!

00:15.758 --> 00:17.674
Max, hey.

00:17.751 --> 00:19.009
Explain that.

00:19.086 --> 00:20.619
I want to be here for you.

00:20.696 --> 00:23.388
But you have to come clean;
you have to tell me the truth.

00:23.399 --> 00:25.566
That is the only
way this can work.

00:25.642 --> 00:27.985
- Can't tell you.
<i>- I just need some time.</i>

00:28.062 --> 00:30.479
<i>I am gonna find out
who killed my sister</i>

00:30.555 --> 00:32.522
<i>and I am gonna
bring them to justice.</i>

00:32.598 --> 00:34.983
I didn't kill those girls,
Isobel. You know who did.

00:35.060 --> 00:36.860
<i>It was Isobel, wasn't it?</i>

00:36.937 --> 00:38.070
<i>Yes.</i>

00:38.080 --> 00:40.205
I never want to see you again.

00:42.043 --> 00:45.911
This is classified case 9-2278

00:45.921 --> 00:47.412
of an unidentified subject

00:47.423 --> 00:49.247
acquired from
the crash at Roswell.

00:49.258 --> 00:53.585
I, Lieutenant Colonel
Harlan Manes,

00:53.596 --> 00:55.429
acting director
of Project Shepherd,

00:55.506 --> 00:57.422
will oversee today's procedure

00:57.433 --> 01:00.267
and document all subsequent
related discoveries

01:00.344 --> 01:01.435
in accordance with
my jurisdiction.

01:02.629 --> 01:03.812
Catalogue every piece of it.

01:07.759 --> 01:10.360

01:49.718 --> 01:51.393
Have you seen
this marking before?

01:51.469 --> 01:54.321
We've never seen
any of this before.

02:05.192 --> 02:08.043
<i>There are five stages of grief.</i>

02:11.198 --> 02:13.799
<i>Denial is first,
but we're way past that.</i>

02:21.166 --> 02:23.392
<i>The second stage is anger.</i>

02:34.179 --> 02:36.655
<i>I haven't hit stage three yet.</i>

02:39.776 --> 02:41.869
<i>In fact,
I might never get there.</i>

02:44.039 --> 02:47.157
<i>Because to be honest...</i>

02:47.234 --> 02:51.161
<i>rage feels a lot better
than sadness.</i>

02:51.238 --> 02:54.089
<i>This anger has become
my best friend.</i>

02:55.742 --> 02:57.334
<i>It's my fuel.</i>

02:57.410 --> 02:59.261
<i>It's my armor.</i>

03:30.235 --> 03:32.669
Hi.

03:35.115 --> 03:36.256
Oh.

03:36.333 --> 03:37.758
You stayed the night.

03:37.834 --> 03:39.209
Not on purpose.

03:39.286 --> 03:43.880
I planned on the late-night
walk of no shame at all.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.432
But I think I may
have been over-served.

03:45.509 --> 03:47.050
Cam...

03:47.127 --> 03:48.268
No, no.

03:48.345 --> 03:49.928
We, uh, we don't need
to talk about it.

03:49.939 --> 03:53.265
I know this is a "any port
in a storm" situation.

03:53.275 --> 03:55.934
And you're just a scratching
post for me, too, Evans.

03:55.945 --> 03:57.769
Copy you.

03:59.523 --> 04:01.097
I got to get to the office.

04:01.175 --> 04:07.120
Valenti's bringing in some suit
to evaluate my mental fitness.

04:07.197 --> 04:08.905
Yeah, it's only been a week.

04:08.982 --> 04:11.866
And you did just take a bullet,

04:11.943 --> 04:14.077
shoot Wyatt Long's kneecap off,

04:14.154 --> 04:17.038
disappear before questioning,
sew yourself up

04:17.115 --> 04:18.790
and refuse to talk
to your partner about it.

04:18.801 --> 04:21.041
There is such a thing
as too macho.

04:21.119 --> 04:24.137
Uh, it's the opposite
of that; I'm, uh...

04:24.214 --> 04:26.473
latrophobic.

04:26.550 --> 04:29.142
You're afraid of doctors.

04:29.219 --> 04:30.727
Right.

04:34.466 --> 04:37.100
<i>So your hours are
strictly 9:00 until whenever.</i>

04:37.177 --> 04:40.228
This is a local's bar,
so there's a certain type

04:40.305 --> 04:41.655
of crazy we're trying
to keep out.

04:41.732 --> 04:45.233
No tinfoil hats,
no antennae, no cosplay.

04:45.310 --> 04:49.112
They are not innocent
intergalactic ren-faire types,

04:49.189 --> 04:51.999
they're one stiff drink away
from the worst kind of crazy:

04:52.075 --> 04:55.243
the alt-right
conspiracy nutjobs and...

04:55.320 --> 04:56.453
I have a strong pour.

04:56.529 --> 04:57.504
Got it.

04:57.581 --> 04:59.840
Good.
What kind of crazy is that?

05:01.343 --> 05:04.011
The aliens are here,
they have been for years.

05:04.087 --> 05:06.680
They've been hiding in...
in plain sight.

05:06.757 --> 05:08.015
That's my kind.

05:08.091 --> 05:09.799
I've seen their ship.

05:09.876 --> 05:11.727
Glowing in the night.

05:14.598 --> 05:16.514
It's gonna be okay, Mom.

05:25.558 --> 05:28.276
When I woke up, I was in
some kind of shipping crate

05:28.353 --> 05:29.819
and I could smell gasoline.

05:29.896 --> 05:31.654
Wyatt Long kept
asking me who I told.

05:31.731 --> 05:32.947
Told about what?

05:33.024 --> 05:34.207
I don't know.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.119
Look, I already gave
my statement that night.

05:38.196 --> 05:40.455
We just want to know if things
have clarified at all,

05:40.532 --> 05:42.466
now that there's been
time since the trauma.

05:44.869 --> 05:46.086
Anyway.

05:46.162 --> 05:48.513
At what point
did you call Deputy Evans?

05:49.707 --> 05:51.049
I didn't call him.

05:51.060 --> 05:53.009
So he just...

05:53.086 --> 05:55.053
sensed you were in trouble
and showed up?

05:55.064 --> 05:56.563
What a knight in shining armor.

05:56.640 --> 05:58.315
I was just passing through.

05:58.392 --> 06:00.567
Through what, exactly?

06:00.644 --> 06:02.903
That warehouse
is surrounded by nada.

06:02.979 --> 06:04.529
Yeah, I like the open road.

06:05.723 --> 06:08.358
And disregarding protocol?

06:08.435 --> 06:09.901
Not calling for backup?

06:09.912 --> 06:11.861
You discharged
an unregistered firearm.

06:11.938 --> 06:16.032
Wyatt Long executed a man,
tried to barbecue a woman,

06:16.109 --> 06:18.251
and then put a hole in my arm.

06:18.328 --> 06:19.669
The shot was justified.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.164
So why don't you
sign those papers

06:23.241 --> 06:25.801
so I can do my damn job?

06:32.008 --> 06:34.050
If you think of anything else...

06:34.127 --> 06:35.268
I've told you everything.

06:41.017 --> 06:45.112
Didn't you...
recently save her life?

06:45.188 --> 06:47.364
This morning, when you said
"any port in a storm"?

06:48.692 --> 06:51.535
Liz Ortecho's my hurricane.

07:02.706 --> 07:04.581
I just need a minute.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.374
I'm sorry...
I am not doing this, Isobel.

07:06.451 --> 07:08.710
Listen, I am sorry.
I didn't know.

07:08.786 --> 07:11.471
I still... I don't remember.
I don't know why I would have

07:11.548 --> 07:12.973
done something like that.
Please... So then,

07:13.049 --> 07:15.300
how can you apologize?

07:15.310 --> 07:18.303
You killed three people.

07:18.313 --> 07:19.554
You should be locked up, period.

07:19.631 --> 07:21.598
But you haven't
gone to the cops.

07:21.674 --> 07:23.766
Why? I mean,
it's been a week

07:23.843 --> 07:24.985
and you haven't done anything.

07:25.061 --> 07:26.486
I can't trust the cops
or the government.

07:28.157 --> 07:30.315
I can't call attention to myself

07:30.325 --> 07:32.650
because it'll call attention
to my father.

07:32.661 --> 07:35.778
So there is no justice.

07:35.855 --> 07:38.323
My sister dies a statistic
and we're just another

07:38.333 --> 07:40.333
immigrant family that America
will be better off without.

07:40.410 --> 07:41.835
We never meant to make her
into a villain.

07:41.912 --> 07:43.870
You know that.
Please, just...

07:43.881 --> 07:45.330
let me talk to you.

07:45.340 --> 07:46.456
I haven't slept.

07:46.533 --> 07:47.674
I feel like I'm going crazy.

07:47.751 --> 07:49.050
I am so sorry.

07:50.554 --> 07:53.180
You know what
keeps me up at night?

07:53.256 --> 07:55.924
If you don't know why
you killed her,

07:56.000 --> 07:57.800
how can you guarantee
it won't happen again?

07:57.877 --> 07:59.511
I know you had
another blackout last week.

07:59.521 --> 08:00.845
It could escalate again.

08:00.856 --> 08:02.847
And this time,
if you hurt someone,

08:02.858 --> 08:04.182
that blood is on my hands.

08:04.193 --> 08:07.402
Because I'm keeping
your secret, even now.

08:22.953 --> 08:24.494
Alex.

08:24.571 --> 08:26.704
Mad scientist is a
good look for you.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.957
What are you doing at the
hospital? Is everything okay?

08:29.033 --> 08:30.667
You don't have your crutch.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.219
Yeah.

08:32.294 --> 08:34.837
I just... I needed a little time
to get used to the new normal.

08:34.914 --> 08:37.381
Not planning on running any
marathons any time soon, though.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.226
Oh, I don't know,
an excuse to avoid running

08:39.302 --> 08:40.434
sounds like a perk to me.

08:42.589 --> 08:44.397
I'm, uh, I'm actually
here to see you.

08:44.474 --> 08:46.808
I've called, but, um...

08:46.884 --> 08:48.726
Oh, I-I haven't
really looked at my phone.

08:48.737 --> 08:50.737
You know that nobody
believes that excuse, right?

08:50.814 --> 08:52.814
Maria's also left a message.

08:52.890 --> 08:54.691
Did you get that, or...?

08:54.701 --> 08:56.693
Yeah, I've just been
really focused on my work.

08:56.769 --> 08:59.412
Yeah, clearly. You're the only
one here on a Saturday.

09:01.491 --> 09:03.408
Look, Maria's too
nice to say anything.

09:03.418 --> 09:06.995
But I left nice
back in the Middle East.

09:07.071 --> 09:08.547
You've been a crappy friend.

09:09.741 --> 09:11.374
Excuse me?

09:11.451 --> 09:13.710
Since you've been home,
have you two talked at all

09:13.786 --> 09:15.303
about what's going on with her?

09:16.431 --> 09:18.089
I've been preoccupied.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.757
Look, I get it.

09:19.768 --> 09:22.719
It is easy to get caught
up in your problems.

09:22.795 --> 09:25.054
Your trauma, your work.

09:25.131 --> 09:29.067
But sometimes, Liz, you got to
be a human being, too.

09:32.948 --> 09:34.397
Yeah.

09:34.474 --> 09:37.442
Will wasn't convinced either.

09:37.452 --> 09:39.619
Until the bunker.
Will?

09:39.696 --> 09:41.279
Smith, honey.

09:41.290 --> 09:44.407
Uh, we-we asked for peace...

09:44.484 --> 09:45.792
and the alien, h-he said,

09:45.869 --> 09:47.794
"No peace. Die."

09:47.871 --> 09:49.746
Yeah, um...

09:49.822 --> 09:51.581
Um,<i> Independence Day</i> is just,

09:51.658 --> 09:52.966
it's just a movie, Mom.

09:53.043 --> 09:56.803
There are no aliens
coming for us, okay?

09:56.880 --> 09:59.222
You can be such a buzzkill,
sweetheart.

10:00.809 --> 10:02.383
Oh, gosh.

10:02.460 --> 10:03.926
Can I get a jacket?
Yeah, yeah.

10:04.003 --> 10:06.596
Here, take mine.
Hi, Mimi.

10:06.673 --> 10:08.389
Oh, hi.
Hey.

10:08.466 --> 10:11.151
Mama DeLuca. I missed you.
Oh...

10:11.227 --> 10:13.061
Where the hell
have you been, kid?

10:13.137 --> 10:15.313
Oh, everywhere but here,
but I'm back now.

10:15.324 --> 10:16.656
I'm sorry I haven't visited.

10:16.733 --> 10:19.275
Oh... stuff happens.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.069
You don't need to apologize.

10:21.145 --> 10:22.945
Hmm.

10:23.022 --> 10:26.157
What's important
is you're here now, Rosa.

10:26.234 --> 10:27.909
Mom, it's...

10:27.985 --> 10:29.243
That's Liz.

10:29.320 --> 10:30.995
You remember. You used
to take the three of us

10:31.006 --> 10:32.330
to the drive-in every weekend.

10:32.341 --> 10:34.123
Yeah?

10:34.200 --> 10:35.917
Oh. Yes.

10:35.993 --> 10:38.336
I haven't seen you
since high school.

10:38.347 --> 10:40.672
Girl, you got hot.

10:40.682 --> 10:42.173
Oh...

10:42.184 --> 10:43.808
Oh...

10:57.032 --> 10:59.357
What happened to "I can handle
the truth, Michael"?

10:59.368 --> 11:02.702
"I am the protagonist of
my own story, Michael"?

11:02.779 --> 11:04.320
"What would Beyoncé do,
Michael?"

11:04.331 --> 11:05.789
Liz Ortecho happened.

11:09.861 --> 11:11.703
What if it's just
a matter of time

11:11.713 --> 11:13.371
before I hurt someone else?

11:13.382 --> 11:15.873
That was an isolated event
ten years ago.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.208
Was it?

11:17.219 --> 11:18.726
Michael?

11:18.803 --> 11:20.545
Because last week, I remember
waking up in the desert,

11:20.555 --> 11:22.055
no clue how I got there

11:22.132 --> 11:23.640
or what I'd done
for the last several hours.

11:27.712 --> 11:29.062
What happens if next time...

11:29.139 --> 11:30.355
I won't let
there be a next time.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.315
I believe you.

11:41.392 --> 11:42.909
I do.

11:45.271 --> 11:47.080
But there's some

11:47.157 --> 11:50.658
thing inside of me...

11:50.735 --> 11:52.310
that doesn't care
what I believe.

11:56.115 --> 11:59.050
And I'm terrified
what it's gonna do next.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.262
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

12:04.641 --> 12:06.007
'Cause I didn't ask.

12:06.083 --> 12:08.259
No, it's not your fault.

12:08.270 --> 12:10.603
I wanted to be the fun friend.

12:10.680 --> 12:12.430
I love being the fun friend.

12:12.441 --> 12:15.683
I just, I thought
I could do that

12:15.760 --> 12:18.227
awhile before the
reality show contestant

12:18.304 --> 12:20.605
sob story set in.
What's the diagnosis?

12:20.615 --> 12:22.273
There isn't one.

12:22.284 --> 12:25.026
It's not early-onset dementia
or Alzheimer's.

12:25.102 --> 12:27.904
No tumor, no toxins.

12:27.980 --> 12:30.281
I can't even count the number
of old, white, rich doctors

12:30.292 --> 12:31.791
that have not-so-subtly implied

12:31.868 --> 12:34.702
that she's just
faking all of this.

12:34.779 --> 12:36.579
So this is why you work so hard.

12:36.656 --> 12:40.041
Running the bar,
doing the psychic thing.

12:40.117 --> 12:41.542
We're doing just about
anything for a buck

12:41.619 --> 12:43.211
so we don't lose
the people we love.

12:43.287 --> 12:45.213
Have you thought about
putting her in a care facility?

12:45.289 --> 12:48.641
No, that just feels
like giving up hope.

12:48.718 --> 12:50.268
I'm not down for that yet.

12:51.504 --> 12:52.812
You don't have to do this alone.

12:52.889 --> 12:57.642
Let's give her
a full-on Mama DeLuca day.

12:57.652 --> 12:59.268
Roswell's greatest hits.

12:59.345 --> 13:01.729
My dad plays Barajas
with the drive-in guy.

13:01.806 --> 13:03.490
I can rustle up some milkshakes
at the Crashdown.

13:05.494 --> 13:06.785
She does love the antennae.

13:10.982 --> 13:13.574
I already told you, man.

13:13.651 --> 13:14.834
I don't remember jack.

13:14.911 --> 13:16.753
A man is dead because of you.

13:16.830 --> 13:19.172
And you tried to burn Liz alive.

13:19.249 --> 13:21.165
I had a few too many,
I passed out in my truck

13:21.176 --> 13:23.343
and I woke up here with y'all
telling me I did that stuff!

13:23.419 --> 13:27.338
The end.

13:27.349 --> 13:31.092
Do you really have
that much hate in you?

13:31.168 --> 13:33.594
The night your sister died,

13:33.671 --> 13:34.971
Liz lost her sister, too.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.306
But if this is about revenge...

13:37.383 --> 13:39.317
why kill Green?

13:41.512 --> 13:42.812
I want my lawyer.

13:42.889 --> 13:45.031
Not until you tell me why.
Evans.

13:48.537 --> 13:51.529
I am not gonna play
"good cop, bad cop" with you.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.197
You're not any type of cop
because right now

13:53.208 --> 13:55.199
you're off duty
and violating his rights.

13:55.210 --> 13:57.535
If you get your badge
pulled, I'm gonna have to

13:57.546 --> 13:59.337
teach some new dumb-ass
my donut order.

14:01.240 --> 14:02.590
Go home.

14:11.042 --> 14:13.009
Your lawyer's on her way.

14:13.085 --> 14:14.561
We're going to ask
you to write down

14:14.637 --> 14:16.479
your account of the evening.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.055
I just told you.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.899
I don't remember.
Then write that.

14:22.404 --> 14:23.903
Do you need help sounding out

14:23.980 --> 14:26.814
the big words?
I'm not lying, you know.

14:26.891 --> 14:28.649
I really blacked it all out.

14:28.726 --> 14:31.411
Look, getting wasted and
shooting at a Mexican...

14:31.487 --> 14:33.738
Yeah, that kind of
sounds like me.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.197
Are you making jokes right now?
No, no.

14:35.274 --> 14:37.700
'Cause you almost killed Max.

14:37.777 --> 14:39.168
Deputy Evans.

14:40.363 --> 14:41.495
If your crappy aim

14:41.572 --> 14:43.539
had been a crappy
two inches to the left,

14:43.616 --> 14:45.249
you'd have two murder charges
on your hands.

14:45.260 --> 14:47.594
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't have done that

14:47.670 --> 14:49.596
because I respect cops.

14:49.672 --> 14:51.097
Honest.

14:51.174 --> 14:53.215
Hey... blue lives matter.

14:53.292 --> 14:54.392
Okay.

14:59.182 --> 15:01.107
What is that?

15:01.184 --> 15:03.318
What?
This.

15:07.782 --> 15:08.865
I don't know.

15:25.783 --> 15:27.792
Okay. Saturn's Rings,
Blast from the Past-rami,

15:27.802 --> 15:29.919
Shatner's Special Shake,
hold the cherry.

15:29.996 --> 15:31.971
Rosa, you remembered.

15:32.048 --> 15:33.806
Mom, I...

15:33.883 --> 15:35.058
told you about Rosa.

15:38.521 --> 15:40.262
I just need some air.

16:23.692 --> 16:27.977
I grew up
with Jesse Manes, Alex.

16:28.054 --> 16:31.188
And I knew the very day
that he learned too much.

16:31.199 --> 16:32.573
Because he came to school

16:32.650 --> 16:34.534
with the darkest energy
around him.

16:34.610 --> 16:36.277
Energy from another place.

16:36.353 --> 16:38.696
What place?

16:38.707 --> 16:42.658
Something broke
in this town once.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.035
Long ago.

16:44.045 --> 16:45.712
And the pieces shattered.

16:45.788 --> 16:50.008
We aren't meant to touch things
from another world, Alex.

16:51.961 --> 16:53.961
The other world creeps into us

16:54.038 --> 16:55.722
and makes us ugly inside.

16:58.226 --> 17:01.269
Don't let it do to you
what it did to your father.

17:02.755 --> 17:05.231
What it did to...

17:05.308 --> 17:07.066
poor, sweet, Jimmy Valenti.

17:07.143 --> 17:09.359
Wait, what-what?
What about Jim Valenti?

17:10.864 --> 17:13.064
Where did Rosa run off to? Mimi.

17:13.074 --> 17:15.983
You were about to say
something about Jim Valenti.

17:16.060 --> 17:18.486
Ugh, Jim Valenti.

17:18.561 --> 17:21.539
You know he cheats
on his wife, right?

17:23.025 --> 17:24.291
Someone should tell her.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.008
Leave.

17:41.085 --> 17:43.552
Missed you, too.

17:43.629 --> 17:45.271
This isn't
a conversation, Michael.

17:45.348 --> 17:47.139
You are not my family,
you are not my friend.

17:47.216 --> 17:48.441
So get off my property.

17:48.518 --> 17:50.726
I need to talk to
you about Isobel.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.020
She needs us.
Pretty sure you two

17:53.097 --> 17:55.189
have been just fine figuring
things out on your own,

17:55.266 --> 17:57.066
leaving me in the dark
about my own life.

17:57.077 --> 17:59.443
We had no choice but to
run Liz out of town, Max.

17:59.454 --> 18:00.978
We knew you would cave.

18:01.055 --> 18:02.789
You would have never been able
to watch her grieve Rosa.

18:02.865 --> 18:04.457
You were gonna tell
her our secret.

18:04.534 --> 18:05.792
That wasn't
your decision to make.

18:05.868 --> 18:07.535
You weren't capable
of making it.

18:07.611 --> 18:08.795
What if it had been Alex Manes?

18:10.990 --> 18:12.507
Hmm?

18:14.636 --> 18:17.804
What if the reason Alex
left town that summer was me?

18:17.880 --> 18:21.015
How long you known about that?

18:29.466 --> 18:30.608
Yeah.

18:32.803 --> 18:33.978
You're right.

18:33.988 --> 18:36.656
If you...

18:36.732 --> 18:38.407
were the reason that
Alex went to war...

18:40.161 --> 18:41.402
...I'd hate you.

18:41.478 --> 18:43.162
Yeah.

18:45.575 --> 18:47.625
I have work to do.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.186
Your mom seems okay.

19:07.263 --> 19:10.764
Yeah, totally fine.

19:10.841 --> 19:13.609
She's not at all worried about
the impending alien invasion.

19:15.363 --> 19:17.479
She knows Will Smith
will save us.

19:17.556 --> 19:21.108
How are you not angrier?

19:21.185 --> 19:24.028
Or, like... crying?

19:24.038 --> 19:25.872
If I was going through
what you're going through,

19:25.948 --> 19:27.990
I would just want
to break stuff all the time.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.325
Well, I'm angry.

19:29.401 --> 19:31.711
I just...

19:31.787 --> 19:33.337
just try to be more like my mom.

19:36.459 --> 19:39.168
Truth is, everything I like
about myself I got from her.

19:39.245 --> 19:42.221
Everyone in this town
rejected everything about me

19:42.298 --> 19:45.174
and she just...

19:45.251 --> 19:47.468
she just embraced it
and raised me to love myself.

19:47.544 --> 19:49.511
The sound of my own voice,

19:49.588 --> 19:52.514
the way I crazy dance and

19:52.591 --> 19:55.476
the color of my skin
when I literally thought

19:55.552 --> 19:57.353
we were the only
black people in the world.

19:59.482 --> 20:03.067
Now every day it's like a...

20:03.077 --> 20:04.911
it's like a piece of her
just slips away.

20:10.159 --> 20:12.335
It's a piece of me
that I lose, too, you know?

20:15.256 --> 20:17.131
No, I'm-I'm good, okay?

20:17.208 --> 20:20.051
I-I have, I have
full range of motion.

20:22.338 --> 20:23.921
No, I-I'll take desk duty, okay?

20:23.932 --> 20:25.172
I-I'll... Sheriff.

20:25.249 --> 20:26.432
Sheriff Valenti.

20:31.105 --> 20:32.271
Is this a bad time?

20:33.757 --> 20:35.057
Yeah, kind of.

20:35.134 --> 20:37.276
Well...

20:38.604 --> 20:41.855
Look, I-I got a murderer
getting spoon-fed Jell-O

20:41.932 --> 20:43.440
in Roswell Community Medical
instead of suffering

20:43.451 --> 20:44.775
in a coffin-sized cell.

20:44.786 --> 20:46.360
So if you're here about Isobel,

20:46.437 --> 20:47.778
I appreciate the effort,

20:47.789 --> 20:49.288
but please stay out of it.

20:49.365 --> 20:50.489
Out of...?

20:50.566 --> 20:51.532
Out of our fight.

20:51.608 --> 20:53.575
It's, it's twin stuff.

20:53.652 --> 20:55.369
It's-it's not something I can explain
to you... Yeah, I'm-I'm not here

20:55.446 --> 20:57.371
about your fight with Isobel,
I'm here about

20:57.448 --> 20:59.540
my fight with Isobel.
I kicked her out.

20:59.616 --> 21:01.792
I couldn't deal with
her lies anymore.

21:01.803 --> 21:04.053
I figured she was staying here.

21:09.644 --> 21:12.303
I'm sorry, man.

21:12.313 --> 21:15.022
She's not here.

21:17.059 --> 21:19.643
Listen, maybe you're doing
the right thing.

21:19.654 --> 21:22.029
Splitting up.

21:24.158 --> 21:26.784
That's not really the pep talk
I came here for.

21:31.190 --> 21:33.374
Hey, Noah, I'm sorry.

21:35.361 --> 21:37.169
You're a good man.

21:37.246 --> 21:39.672
And you...
and you treat her so well.

21:39.749 --> 21:42.008
Maybe people like you
deserve better

21:42.084 --> 21:44.176
than people like Isobel.

21:48.374 --> 21:49.432
Yeah.

21:56.265 --> 22:00.267
I see a beautiful girl
on your arm this year.

22:00.344 --> 22:02.519
I think you might be

22:02.530 --> 22:05.105
a little off with that take, Mom.
Wait, wait, wait.

22:05.182 --> 22:07.941
I'm getting a little clarity.

22:08.018 --> 22:10.319
Still a girl.

22:10.396 --> 22:12.529
A great set of legs.

22:12.540 --> 22:14.156
Tail to die for.

22:14.233 --> 22:17.376
And a cute little snout...
on your beagle.

22:21.407 --> 22:22.331
All right, do Maria.

22:22.408 --> 22:23.716
No. No, no.

22:23.793 --> 22:26.043
No peering into my future.

22:26.054 --> 22:29.630
I hate spoilers.
Mm-hmm. Well, that means

22:29.706 --> 22:31.006
that Liz is up.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.966
Mm-mm.
Yes, please.

22:33.043 --> 22:35.052
Don't be scared.
I'm very attuned.

22:37.306 --> 22:39.890
Come on.

22:39.901 --> 22:41.901
Okay.

22:45.556 --> 22:48.399
The last time I read your aura,
you were at a crossroads.

22:48.409 --> 22:50.150
What happened?

22:50.227 --> 22:51.860
What road did you take, Rosa?

22:51.937 --> 22:53.153
M-Mom,

22:53.230 --> 22:55.656
no... it's Liz. Remember?

22:55.732 --> 22:57.333
We-we just talked about it.
Maria.

22:58.503 --> 23:00.086
It's okay.

23:02.072 --> 23:03.923
Reality sucks.

23:03.999 --> 23:05.883
Why drag her into any of it?

23:11.057 --> 23:12.923
You know what?
You're right, Mimi.

23:12.934 --> 23:16.927
Last time you saw me, I-I was
at the precipice of something.

23:16.938 --> 23:20.764
At a turning point.

23:20.775 --> 23:25.060
I've been clean for ten years.

23:25.137 --> 23:29.273
My dad is so proud, he hung
my chip up at the Crashdown.

23:30.767 --> 23:35.279
I went to art school, in Paris.

23:35.289 --> 23:37.739
I had a couple heartbreaks.

23:37.816 --> 23:40.793
And a few spectacularly epic
romances.

23:40.870 --> 23:42.628
But, um,

23:42.705 --> 23:45.172
mostly, I learned
to love myself.

23:48.994 --> 23:51.920
I visit home a lot,
to see my dad.

23:51.997 --> 23:55.132
We make churro pancakes
and any time I feel

23:55.143 --> 23:59.311
like I am slipping into
a dark place, I confide in him,

23:59.388 --> 24:02.890
and in my sister.

24:02.966 --> 24:06.193
And they help me find the light.

24:12.735 --> 24:16.612
You have a beautiful destiny.

24:16.688 --> 24:18.372
You always did, Rosa.

24:32.996 --> 24:34.296
Evans.

24:34.373 --> 24:35.506
Yo, Maximo.

24:35.516 --> 24:37.174
I took a page out of your book,

24:37.251 --> 24:40.010
and tried to channel
all my romantic woes into work.

24:40.021 --> 24:42.679
Listen, you're gonna want
to lay off Wyatt Long.

24:42.690 --> 24:43.680
Yeah, no.

24:43.691 --> 24:45.224
Look, I've got a buddy

24:45.234 --> 24:46.975
at the law firm
his dad just hired.

24:47.052 --> 24:48.694
And?
And they're gonna try and say

24:48.771 --> 24:50.604
that Grant Green
was self-defense.

24:50.681 --> 24:51.980
Oh, that's bull.

24:52.057 --> 24:53.482
And if you testify against him,

24:53.559 --> 24:55.025
drive his charges up,

24:55.036 --> 24:56.860
they're gonna dig
into your time on the force.

24:56.871 --> 24:58.278
Try to discredit you...

24:58.355 --> 24:59.863
Yeah, well,
my-my record is clean.

24:59.874 --> 25:01.823
They are not gonna
come after you.

25:01.900 --> 25:04.043
They're gonna come after
the people you care about.

25:04.119 --> 25:06.495
They know

25:06.572 --> 25:08.622
you've been making efforts
to protect Arturo.

25:08.699 --> 25:11.667
As deputy, you're legally
obligated to notify ICE

25:11.743 --> 25:13.377
if you suspect...
Yeah, yeah, I get it,

25:13.387 --> 25:15.346
there's no justice in the world,
copy that.

25:21.229 --> 25:22.728
Oh!
Oh. Close.

25:22.805 --> 25:24.179
Close.
Come on.

25:24.256 --> 25:25.806
You know why I love this place?

25:25.882 --> 25:27.599
It's an escape.

25:27.676 --> 25:29.017
Mm.

25:29.094 --> 25:31.853
Everybody needs an
escape sometimes.

25:33.765 --> 25:35.908
What happened with the blonde?

25:35.985 --> 25:37.693
The blonde?

25:37.769 --> 25:41.196
The-the, the rotten one, the
one you said was hunting you.

25:41.273 --> 25:42.823
Isobel Evans.

25:42.899 --> 25:46.034
What did Rosa...

25:46.111 --> 25:50.247
What did I say to you
about Isobel Evans, Mimi?

25:50.258 --> 25:53.425
You said that you knew
her secrets.

25:53.502 --> 25:56.545
She confessed something to you.

25:56.622 --> 25:58.931
It scared you.

25:59.008 --> 26:00.933
Y-You wouldn't tell me
what it was,

26:01.010 --> 26:03.477
but you said you were thinking
about telling your father.

26:05.014 --> 26:06.939
That's the reason.

26:07.016 --> 26:11.560
Isobel was afraid she would
tell, that's why it happened.

26:11.637 --> 26:13.320
What happened, Rosa?

26:16.867 --> 26:19.234
Uh, a hoodie, a belt

26:19.311 --> 26:21.954
and <i> The Great Gatsby.</i>

26:22.031 --> 26:23.956
Stuff you left at my place.

26:28.796 --> 26:30.629
Is this supposed to feel
like a breakup?

26:30.706 --> 26:34.124
Well, I don't think you can
break up with a scratching post,

26:34.135 --> 26:37.544
but I feel like
it's probably better

26:37.621 --> 26:40.047
if we don't scratch anymore.

26:40.123 --> 26:41.599
Like, ever.

26:47.798 --> 26:50.557
Now that we're clear on that,

26:50.634 --> 26:52.476
I'm, uh, I'm a little
low on friends

26:52.486 --> 26:54.895
at the moment.

26:54.971 --> 26:57.773
You're it.
And I could use a beer.

26:57.849 --> 27:00.951
I was hoping you'd say that.

27:18.537 --> 27:20.504
How old were you

27:20.514 --> 27:22.172
when you got your first tattoo?

27:22.183 --> 27:25.175
Random, but I'll bite.

27:25.186 --> 27:28.020
Uh, my 21st birthday. You?

27:28.097 --> 27:32.641
18. The flower on my foot,
for my aunt.

27:32.718 --> 27:35.102
And the scorpion
firing a machine gun?

27:35.178 --> 27:37.354
Drunken dare on leave
with my unit.

27:37.365 --> 27:40.491
How long have you been
dying to ask about that?

27:43.311 --> 27:47.864
I feel like, uh, bodies are a
road map to our lives, you know?

27:47.875 --> 27:50.492
Battle wounds.

27:50.569 --> 27:53.337
Tattoos are
like the scars we choose.

27:56.291 --> 28:00.552
Like, this one is for my sister.

28:00.629 --> 28:02.170
She has the other half.

28:02.247 --> 28:03.964
Two birds,

28:04.040 --> 28:05.882
finally uncaged.

28:05.893 --> 28:07.384
Huh. I didn't know
you had a sister.

28:07.461 --> 28:09.561
Charlie.

28:09.638 --> 28:13.557
In some ways,
she was my partner before you.

28:13.567 --> 28:15.642
But, uh,

28:15.719 --> 28:17.644
she broke some rules.

28:17.721 --> 28:20.021
Blew a whistle because

28:20.098 --> 28:22.023
she thought it was
the right thing to do,

28:22.100 --> 28:27.246
and when it came time
to protect her, I didn't.

28:27.322 --> 28:29.364
She's locked up now,

28:29.441 --> 28:31.199
because of me.

28:31.276 --> 28:34.920
So this tattoo means
something different now.

28:36.832 --> 28:38.590
All right. Your turn.

28:38.667 --> 28:40.208
Oh, none of mine are that deep.

28:40.285 --> 28:42.335
The symbol on your shoulder?

28:42.412 --> 28:43.837
It doesn't mean anything.

28:43.914 --> 28:45.505
Actually, it's just, uh,

28:45.582 --> 28:47.433
something I used to doodle
when I was a kid.

28:47.509 --> 28:50.010
In the margins of notebooks,
or on my sneakers, whatever.

28:50.086 --> 28:54.440
Okay, I just told you
about the most important person

28:54.516 --> 28:59.269
in my life, and you're
telling me that's a doodle.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.605
Yeah. I mean, I wish
I had a better story.

29:01.615 --> 29:05.025
But, I got trashed on my 21st
and decided to get a tattoo.

29:05.101 --> 29:06.693
Okay. Well,

29:06.770 --> 29:10.238
I asked Wyatt Long
to write down his confession,

29:10.315 --> 29:12.240
and...

29:12.317 --> 29:13.625
he drew that.

29:20.492 --> 29:22.584
Want to amend
your answer, Evans?

29:22.661 --> 29:24.586
You can finish my beer.

29:24.663 --> 29:26.922
Evans.

29:26.998 --> 29:28.757
Max.

29:32.170 --> 29:34.813
<i>She will tear up the whole town</i>

29:34.890 --> 29:36.190
<i>until she finds Harry.</i>

29:49.312 --> 29:52.072
What's got you out
here all alone?

29:52.148 --> 29:55.334
I've been thinking
about what you said,

29:55.410 --> 29:57.244
about breaking free
from Isobel Evans.

29:59.531 --> 30:03.124
Everything changed when Isobel
told Rosa her secret, Liz.

30:03.201 --> 30:05.669
She was so scared.

30:05.679 --> 30:08.088
Did she ever say anything
about aliens?

30:08.164 --> 30:10.516
Rosa knew what I knew.

30:10.592 --> 30:12.726
And the truth was terrifying.

30:14.212 --> 30:17.138
The aliens had aligned
their ships.

30:17.215 --> 30:19.516
One in New York.

30:19.527 --> 30:21.142
D.C., Tokyo.

30:21.219 --> 30:24.446
What... no. Wait, in-in 2008?

30:26.057 --> 30:27.315
Was Will Smith there?

30:27.392 --> 30:29.701
Well...

30:29.778 --> 30:32.821
wouldn't have been able
to destroy the alien scum

30:32.898 --> 30:35.290
without that national treasure.

30:37.378 --> 30:38.919
<i>Independence Day.</i>

30:44.701 --> 30:46.042
Oh.

30:46.053 --> 30:47.878
I have to go to the lab. I, uh,

30:47.954 --> 30:49.004
I have an experiment in progress
and I got to

30:49.080 --> 30:50.889
check and see...
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

30:50.966 --> 30:52.891
But I will be
back in 30 minutes.

30:52.968 --> 30:55.894
Could you, um...

30:55.971 --> 30:58.814
could you meet us
at Sunset Mesa Assisted Living?

31:03.762 --> 31:05.612
It's time.

31:08.150 --> 31:09.357
Howdy.

31:09.434 --> 31:10.734
Securi...

31:10.744 --> 31:14.529
Are you going after Liz
to threaten me?

31:14.606 --> 31:16.573
You have no idea the lengths

31:16.584 --> 31:18.083
I will go to to bring you
to justice,

31:18.160 --> 31:20.744
no matter what fiery hell
that might be.

31:20.754 --> 31:22.871
Max!

31:27.502 --> 31:29.878
<i>You're threatening
a guy in traction?</i>

31:29.955 --> 31:31.087
Are you defending Long
right now?

31:31.098 --> 31:32.839
Wyatt Long is a sack of garbage.

31:32.916 --> 31:34.424
This isn't about him.

31:34.435 --> 31:36.101
I am questioning your character.

31:36.178 --> 31:38.011
As a cop, as a man,

31:38.088 --> 31:39.688
as a human be...

31:44.636 --> 31:46.945
What do you stand for?

31:47.022 --> 31:50.732
You were just talking about
justice, but you're a hypocrite.

31:50.809 --> 31:52.734
You want Wyatt to
suffer, but you let

31:52.811 --> 31:55.403
Rosa's killer walk around
planning brunches for ten years?

31:55.480 --> 31:58.031
Are some murders just more
murder-y than others to you?

31:58.108 --> 31:59.491
Wyatt came after you
for a reason.

31:59.567 --> 32:01.126
I am trying to keep you safe.

32:01.203 --> 32:02.794
You failed.

32:14.383 --> 32:16.475
These are the samples
you collected from me.

32:19.313 --> 32:22.230
What are you doing here, Liz?

32:24.175 --> 32:26.026
Trying to create a weapon.

32:35.329 --> 32:36.945
How do you protect yourself
from a mind reader?

32:37.022 --> 32:38.330
You weaken her,

32:38.407 --> 32:39.915
until she can't use her powers.

32:39.992 --> 32:41.500
Until she can't hurt people.

32:41.576 --> 32:42.951
You were gonna poison her?

32:43.028 --> 32:44.494
I was trying to create a serum

32:44.505 --> 32:45.954
that would mute your powers,

32:46.031 --> 32:47.747
that would do the opposite
of acetone.

32:47.824 --> 32:49.841
Acetone kills our pain.

32:49.918 --> 32:52.002
You were trying to hurt us.
No.

32:52.012 --> 32:54.346
Look, I know you want to punish Isobel...
Yes, I want her to suffer

32:54.423 --> 32:55.889
for the life
that she stole from Rosa.

32:57.634 --> 33:01.186
But there is another reason
that we put bad people away.

33:01.263 --> 33:03.313
To protect the innocent.

33:05.192 --> 33:07.183
Isobel is having blackouts.

33:07.194 --> 33:09.269
A-Are we just supposed
to sit down and wait

33:09.345 --> 33:10.687
for the next murder spree?

33:10.698 --> 33:12.698
She's dangerous, Max.

33:12.774 --> 33:13.907
Something has to be done.

33:36.890 --> 33:38.890
Here to pour salt in a wound?

33:38.967 --> 33:41.226
I shouldn't have thrown Alex
in your face like that.

33:41.303 --> 33:42.728
I'm sorry.

33:42.804 --> 33:44.971
It's just him, you know?

33:45.048 --> 33:46.806
Screws me up.

33:46.883 --> 33:48.400
None of that matters to me.

33:50.428 --> 33:53.354
I'm here to talk about Isobel.

33:53.431 --> 33:56.074
Look, we never talked
about that night,

33:56.151 --> 33:57.743
why she did what she did.

33:57.819 --> 33:59.194
We don't know
what we're protecting her from.

33:59.270 --> 34:00.820
And it could be happening again.

34:00.897 --> 34:02.655
Eh, it's not happening again.

34:02.732 --> 34:03.532
You don't know that.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.742
We don't know anything.

34:07.329 --> 34:09.204
I think we should leave,

34:09.280 --> 34:11.797
find some place to start over.

34:13.243 --> 34:16.418
How does taking her away
from her life,

34:16.429 --> 34:17.795
from her husband, help her?

34:17.806 --> 34:19.505
We don't get to have
lives anymore, okay?

34:19.581 --> 34:22.842
We don't get to be with the
people we want to be with.

34:22.918 --> 34:24.928
The three of us, we
only have each other.

34:24.938 --> 34:26.346
Mm.

34:26.422 --> 34:28.514
A few hours ago, you said

34:28.591 --> 34:31.101
we weren't family.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.518
What changed?

34:32.594 --> 34:33.561
The stakes.

34:33.638 --> 34:35.522
Liz is working on some kind

34:35.598 --> 34:36.688
of alien poison.

34:36.766 --> 34:38.283
And if we don't find a solution,

34:38.360 --> 34:39.859
she's gonna use it.

34:39.936 --> 34:42.120
She doesn't feel safe
with Isobel in town.

34:42.197 --> 34:42.996
Well...

34:44.041 --> 34:45.907
...she's not wrong.

34:45.984 --> 34:49.034
I guess
I shouldn't be surprised.

34:49.112 --> 34:50.870
You guys have been making
decisions

34:50.947 --> 34:52.422
for me for the last decade.

34:55.952 --> 34:58.211
But you know what?

34:58.288 --> 35:01.640
Today, I finally had some time
to actually think for myself.

35:01.716 --> 35:05.093
And, uh...

35:05.170 --> 35:07.303
I mean, Liz is right.

35:07.314 --> 35:09.481
As long as I'm blacking out,

35:09.558 --> 35:10.774
I <i> am</i> dangerous.

35:11.968 --> 35:14.310
I can't run from that.

35:14.321 --> 35:15.436
It's just gonna follow us.

35:15.513 --> 35:17.030
It's not gonna stop.

35:22.020 --> 35:24.996
I'm not going to allow myself

35:25.073 --> 35:27.448
to hurt someone again.

35:27.525 --> 35:28.992
I have to be stopped.

35:29.002 --> 35:30.994
I can't let you inject yourself
with that serum.

35:31.004 --> 35:32.287
We don't know how it works...
