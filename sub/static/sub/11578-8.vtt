00:23.393 --> 00:25.311
In the criminal justice system,

00:25.311 --> 00:28.930
sexually-based offenses 
are considered especially heinous.

00:28.930 --> 00:30.446
In New York City,

00:30.446 --> 00:33.594
the dedicated detectives who investigate 
these vicious felonies are members

00:33.594 --> 00:36.662
of an elite squad known  
as The Special Victims Unit.

00:36.662 --> 00:38.832
These are their stories.

01:04.096 --> 01:08.151
You know, 
they said it couldn't be done.

01:08.151 --> 01:12.939
They said that Allen Thorpe 
couldn't possibly outdo himself again.

01:12.939 --> 01:17.805
I bring you Manhattan's first 
family-friendly five-star hotel.

01:17.805 --> 01:20.653
And I welcome each 
and every one of you...

01:20.653 --> 01:25.681
to the official grand opening 
of the Thorpe Palace.

01:29.656 --> 01:34.327
You know, of all my hotels, 
this one means the most.

01:34.327 --> 01:38.331
Because it's the most personal. 
It's family.

01:38.331 --> 01:41.701
So, we've got a lot more 
in store for you...

01:41.701 --> 01:44.304
so enjoy the ride.

01:58.518 --> 01:59.953
Help.

02:05.825 --> 02:08.348
I was raped.

Law & Order SVU

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2000/12/15

03:07.520 --> 03:09.885
Excuse me.

03:14.427 --> 03:16.763
You mind filling us in?

03:16.763 --> 03:19.165
You mind smiling?

03:19.165 --> 03:22.326
No reason to upset the guests.

03:25.772 --> 03:27.273
- How could this happen?
- Mr. Miller...

03:27.273 --> 03:30.443
Is this what you meant in your brochure  
by "safe as your mother's arms"?

03:30.443 --> 03:34.647
Sir, we're Detectives Benson and Stabler. 
What happened here?

03:34.647 --> 03:40.277
My sister, Siobhan. 
She was attacked.

03:41.921 --> 03:43.256
When did this happen?

03:43.256 --> 03:46.092
We contacted you immediately.

03:46.092 --> 03:48.461
No, you took time 
to pull strings.

03:48.461 --> 03:51.130
You got no blue-and-whites out front, 
no uniforms in here.

03:51.130 --> 03:53.333
That's the idea, right? 
It's called obstructing.

03:53.333 --> 03:56.736
I know what obstructing is, pal. 
I was on the job 20 years.

03:56.736 --> 04:00.373
I assure you, no one associated with the 
Thorpe Hotel Corporation...

04:00.373 --> 04:02.041
has knowingly 
obstructed justice here.

04:02.041 --> 04:03.476
An attorney?

04:03.476 --> 04:08.037
You got an attorney here 
before medical assistance or the police?

04:08.348 --> 04:09.449
Come here.

04:09.449 --> 04:12.151
How old are you, Siobhan?

04:12.151 --> 04:14.584
Seventeen.

04:15.622 --> 04:18.555
Can you tell me 
what happened?

04:19.591 --> 04:21.894
I told it 
three times already.

04:21.894 --> 04:26.455
Okay, let's get you 
to a hospital, all right?

04:27.300 --> 04:29.927
I'll take that for you.

04:42.315 --> 04:47.183
I went into my room, and...

04:47.687 --> 04:51.424
my clothes and my makeup 
were all over the floor.

04:53.593 --> 04:56.959
I couldn't understand it, 
you know?

04:57.697 --> 05:01.063
And so I just 
stood there, staring.

05:03.036 --> 05:06.937
And then I saw him.

05:08.007 --> 05:11.669
Who?  
Did you know this person?

05:13.246 --> 05:15.440
No.

05:19.419 --> 05:22.683
I tried to run out, and...

05:24.357 --> 05:27.621
he slammed my face 
against the door.

05:29.228 --> 05:31.217
Then...

05:33.232 --> 05:37.870
I tried to get away, 
and he went crazy.

05:37.870 --> 05:42.842
He grabbed the phone 
and he started hitting me with it.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.139
And then...

05:48.981 --> 05:53.246
Okay, you can finish 
telling me at the hospital, all right?

05:53.720 --> 05:56.244
He raped me.

06:01.227 --> 06:02.495
No editing.

06:02.495 --> 06:04.564
Excuse me. 
This is a restricted area.

06:04.564 --> 06:06.432
Can't think of a place 
I'd rather be.

06:06.432 --> 06:08.468
Detectives Munch 
and Tutuola.

06:08.468 --> 06:10.937
Sorry. I thought you snuck 
out of the press pen.

06:10.937 --> 06:12.071
What can I do for you?

06:12.071 --> 06:14.741
We need tape rolled on everything  
you've got around room 328...

06:14.741 --> 06:16.109
from the time of the incident.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.778
Elevators, stairwells.

06:18.778 --> 06:19.946
You know we just opened.

06:19.946 --> 06:22.682
Yeah, the grand opening banner 
out front was our first clue.

06:22.682 --> 06:24.550
Roll the tape.

06:24.550 --> 06:27.954
We've got full coverage on everything  
from the fifth floor to the penthouse.

06:27.954 --> 06:29.756
What about the rooms 
without a view?

06:29.756 --> 06:33.693
They didn't quite make the deadline.  
They'll be operational by next week.

06:33.693 --> 06:36.996
That's good news for future victims,  
but little comfort to Siobhan Miller.

06:36.996 --> 06:40.066
Don't tell me we've had 
another freaking emergency.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.001
What is this 
urgent matter, Winston?

06:42.001 --> 06:43.403
That was us.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.805
Pleasure to meet you, 
Mr. Thorpe.

06:45.805 --> 06:47.206
And what do you want?

06:47.206 --> 06:50.510
You weren't informed that one of  
your guests was brutally raped?

06:50.510 --> 06:55.448
My head of security will be handling  
that matter. He's at your disposal.

06:55.448 --> 06:58.040
I have guests waiting.

06:58.518 --> 07:01.354
I understand that one of  
your employees discovered the victim?

07:01.354 --> 07:03.856
Yeah, desk clerk, 
Terry Wilde.

07:03.856 --> 07:05.591
We'll need 
to see him now.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.427
Right this way.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.996
Where did you stash our outcry witness, 
in the boiler room?

07:09.996 --> 07:12.932
He's on his scheduled break 
in the employee cafeteria.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.367
Guy's gotta eat.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.102
And the show must go on.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.037
Bet the party 
didn't miss a beat.

07:18.037 --> 07:20.973
So tell us, Winston, exactly how long  
did you detain the victim...

07:20.973 --> 07:23.042
before allowing her 
to receive medical attention?

07:23.042 --> 07:26.612
We wanted to get that girl 
to the hospital right off. She refused.

07:26.612 --> 07:29.182
Traumatized victims 
frequently refuse treatment.

07:29.182 --> 07:31.317
Most people know better 
than to listen to them.

07:31.317 --> 07:33.419
Bust my hump all you want, 
but I'm telling you...

07:33.419 --> 07:35.922
we're gonna bend over backwards 
to assist you on this.

07:35.922 --> 07:39.618
Okay, where was Allen Thorpe 
during the attack?

07:39.992 --> 07:44.894
Terry, short for Terrence, 
Wilde as in Oscar.

07:45.665 --> 07:47.467
Address?

07:47.467 --> 07:49.602
Why? 
I didn't witness anything.

07:49.602 --> 07:52.438
First person a rape victim speaks to 
about their attack...

07:52.438 --> 07:55.308
is known as the outcry witness. 
That's you.

07:55.308 --> 07:59.212
We didn't really speak. 
"I was raped." End of conversation.

07:59.212 --> 08:02.982
Which makes you the only one that could  
testify to that statement in court.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.517
Court? I have to go court?

08:04.517 --> 08:08.154
It's pretty hectic here today. 
Why weren't you at your post?

08:08.154 --> 08:12.124
Thought I might see 
Julia Roberts or somebody.

08:12.124 --> 08:13.459
Look what happens.

08:13.459 --> 08:16.256
Just isn't your day, is it?

08:17.994 --> 08:20.032
CABRINI MEDICAL CENTER 
227 E, 19TH STREET 
WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 6

08:20.032 --> 08:23.054
Severe trauma to the face,  
hairline fractures

08:23.054 --> 08:26.772
on right wrist and one rib... 
bruise marks on breasts and arms.

08:26.772 --> 08:28.140
Consistent with restraint?

08:28.140 --> 08:29.509
Yes, definitely 
finger marks.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.178
And deeper contusions 
on the legs.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.145
Knee marks.

08:33.145 --> 08:34.780
Yes. Evidence 
of penetration.

08:34.780 --> 08:35.847
Rape kit done?

08:35.847 --> 08:37.082
Just waiting 
to be vouchered.

08:37.082 --> 08:40.482
Lot of fluids. 
Good chance we got semen.

08:40.586 --> 08:42.813
Okay, thanks.

08:50.897 --> 08:53.865
She's asleep, thank God.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.204
She was in so much pain, 
I begged them to up her morphine.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.339
I'll sit with her for a while 
if you need a break.

09:00.339 --> 09:03.643
Yeah, come on, 
let me buy you a cup of coffee.

09:03.643 --> 09:05.778
I could use a cigarette.

09:09.982 --> 09:11.350
He already took pictures.

09:11.350 --> 09:12.790
Special interest case.

09:12.790 --> 09:15.721
Powerful people involved. 
Evidence tends to get lost.

09:15.721 --> 09:18.157
- Any sign of forced entry?
- No.

09:18.157 --> 09:22.388
Victim's five feet. 
This is where the escape was thwarted.

09:23.296 --> 09:28.255
He drags her across the floor, 
rips the phone from its cord.

09:28.935 --> 09:30.924
You mind?

09:36.342 --> 09:38.678
Hits her with the phone.

09:38.678 --> 09:39.812
Throws her on the bed.

09:39.812 --> 09:42.336
And rapes her.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.511
Came prepared.

09:46.819 --> 09:49.322
Pretty much rape, A to Z. 
You got anything else?

09:49.322 --> 09:51.257
Yeah, we should all go 
buy lottery tickets.

09:51.257 --> 09:54.360
Hotels, we usually get prints and fluids 
from a thousand guests.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.062
But this baby 
is brand-spanking new.

09:56.062 --> 09:59.826
Great. So you'll have 
print workups by the morning.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.436
My baby sister. 
I'm supposed to protect her.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.205
I was off at that party 
doing the hokey-pokey, for God's sake.

10:06.205 --> 10:08.975
On your way down, you notice 
anyone hanging out in the hallway?

10:08.975 --> 10:10.443
No.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.446
What about earlier? 
Anyone stand out?

10:13.446 --> 10:15.348
Everyone. 
We're from North Carolina.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.183
Right.

10:17.183 --> 10:19.785
Think. Maybe it didn't mean 
anything at the time...

10:19.785 --> 10:24.523
but looking back, anyone 
pay particular attention to Siobhan?

10:24.523 --> 10:27.126
There was a guy in the park, 
at the puppet show.

10:27.126 --> 10:28.961
He was definitely 
staring at her.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.563
Puppet show?

10:30.563 --> 10:33.332
We're here on family vacation, 
with my wife and little girl.

10:33.332 --> 10:35.301
What do you remember 
about this guy?

10:35.301 --> 10:38.030
He was alone, no kids.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.162
Can you describe him?

10:42.341 --> 10:44.310
White, thirties maybe, 
brown hair.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.112
Height? Weight?

10:46.112 --> 10:49.444
Average. 
That's all I remember.

10:50.049 --> 10:52.451
Where'd you go 
after the park?

10:52.451 --> 10:55.043
Back to Hotel Hell.

10:57.123 --> 11:00.059
Hi, I'm Detective Munch. 
This is Detective Tutuola.

11:00.059 --> 11:01.594
I'm Siobhan's 
sister-in-law.

11:01.594 --> 11:04.397
Perhaps we should talk 
in your room, Miss Miller. Is it nearby?

11:04.397 --> 11:06.432
It's right in here.

11:06.432 --> 11:09.229
No, I didn't hear anything.

11:09.535 --> 11:13.139
Oh, my gosh, 
I must have been drying my hair.

11:13.139 --> 11:14.573
Where was your daughter?

11:14.573 --> 11:16.275
She was with my husband 
at the party.

11:16.275 --> 11:19.512
Siobhan and I went swimming 
after the park and we were running late.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.125
Was anyone at the pool 
bothering her?

11:21.125 --> 11:24.550
No, we didn't even 
talk to anyone.

11:24.550 --> 11:27.820
- Did anyone look out of place?
- No.

11:27.820 --> 11:31.357
Do you mind if we finish this 
a little later?

11:31.357 --> 11:36.123
After what's happened, I just feel like 
I need to spend some time with Tara.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.531
What you got there, Spanky?

11:38.531 --> 11:40.132
Hotel security tapes...

11:40.132 --> 11:44.003
and a state-of-the-art, 
fully digitized deck on which to view them.

11:44.003 --> 11:45.004
Happy?

11:45.004 --> 11:48.700
Assuming there are 
no 18-minute gaps, ecstatic.

11:49.141 --> 11:50.943
Sketch artist finished 
with Siobhan.

11:50.943 --> 11:52.111
Latent finished up too.

11:52.111 --> 11:56.415
The only print they couldn't eliminate 
turned up in the system.

11:56.415 --> 12:00.519
Russell Ramsay. Released 18 months ago. 
One count statutory rape.

12:00.519 --> 12:03.680
Siobhan is just this side of legal.

12:04.023 --> 12:06.684
Pretty damn close.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.862
Our man Winston actually 
came through.

12:09.862 --> 12:10.963
How great is this?

12:10.963 --> 12:12.832
Almost as great as 
us finding our guy.

12:12.832 --> 12:16.995
Fin is throwing together 
a photo array to run by Siobhan.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.271
That's Happy Feet!

12:19.271 --> 12:21.670
Excuse me?

12:22.241 --> 12:25.711
The odd bird at the party, 
and I don't mean the big yellow one.

12:25.711 --> 12:28.076
Can you zoom in?

12:33.185 --> 12:35.521
Okay, wait a minute.

12:35.521 --> 12:38.691
Thorpe is just starting his speech. 
Siobhan came down just as he finished.

12:38.691 --> 12:41.527
Odd behavior for a guy who just 
committed a rape, wouldn't you say?

12:41.527 --> 12:43.429
I guess he worked up an appetite.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.331
Why isn't he getting 
the hell out of Dodge?

12:46.398 --> 12:49.798
Benson. Cragen's looking for you.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.644
We just found our guy 
on the Miller case. Can this wait?

12:58.644 --> 13:00.941
Close the door.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.102
What?

13:03.816 --> 13:06.408
Sit down, Olivia.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.775
What?

13:09.188 --> 13:11.590
Really, I think 
you should sit down.

13:11.590 --> 13:14.455
Just tell me. 
What's going on?

13:15.895 --> 13:18.726
Your mother had an accident.

13:20.499 --> 13:25.060
I am so sorry. 
She didn't make it.

13:27.206 --> 13:29.175
How?

13:29.175 --> 13:30.776
She fell...

13:30.776 --> 13:33.078
down the subway steps, 
110th and Broadway.

13:33.078 --> 13:35.067
No.

13:35.114 --> 13:38.207
My mother never 
takes the subway.

13:40.019 --> 13:43.283
The entrance outside the Velvet Room.

13:46.625 --> 13:48.887
She was drunk.

14:01.440 --> 14:04.076
- did you talk to Benson?
- yeah.

14:04.076 --> 14:07.880
You know, my brother's a mortician. 
In case she has any questions.

14:07.880 --> 14:11.784
- You have a brother?
- I think we found Twinkle-Toes.

14:11.784 --> 14:14.253
Can you believe 
this douche bag?

14:14.253 --> 14:15.788
Killing a fellow cockroach.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.723
Whatever happened 
to professional courtesy?

14:17.723 --> 14:20.020
Russell Ramsay?

14:26.999 --> 14:28.100
What's the problem?

14:28.100 --> 14:30.870
That nobody's 
exterminated you yet.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.605
You have the right 
to remain silent.

14:32.605 --> 14:33.839
What'd I do?

14:33.839 --> 14:37.109
Anything you say can and will be used 
against you in a court of law.

14:37.109 --> 14:38.310
What'd I do?

14:38.310 --> 14:40.479
Aside from defying 
the laws of rhythm?

14:40.479 --> 14:42.014
You have the right 
to an attorney.

14:42.014 --> 14:44.583
If you can't afford one, 
one will be given to you...

14:44.583 --> 14:47.486
This is crazy. 
I never raped nobody.

14:47.486 --> 14:50.456
So the rape that you were 
tried and convicted of three years ago...

14:50.456 --> 14:52.858
what was that? 
A heinous miscarriage of justice?

14:52.858 --> 14:56.095
That was statutory. 
And we were in love.

14:56.095 --> 14:58.964
Yeah and I'm sure 
they'll make a TV movie of it one day.

14:58.964 --> 15:01.500
- But, about Wednesday?
- Wednesday...

15:01.500 --> 15:03.535
We've got your prints 
on the scene...

15:03.535 --> 15:05.638
your bizarrely circuitous 
escape route on tape...

15:05.638 --> 15:09.141
and your victim on her way 
down here to ID you as we speak.

15:09.141 --> 15:11.810
I swear! 
I never raped nobody.

15:11.810 --> 15:16.007
Russell. Now, Wednesday, noon?

15:18.083 --> 15:20.482
I was with a girl.

15:20.519 --> 15:23.248
At that new hotel, the...

15:23.555 --> 15:28.116
Thorpe Palace. 
Her name's Siobhan.

15:31.330 --> 15:36.702
You left her bloody and broken, and 
you're using her as an alibi?

15:36.702 --> 15:40.500
What? What are you talking about?

15:45.077 --> 15:48.807
That bitch said I raped her?

15:50.282 --> 15:52.384
It was a date.

15:52.384 --> 15:55.154
I met her at a bar. 
She gave me her room key.

15:55.154 --> 15:58.190
You happen to remember 
the name of the bar?

15:58.190 --> 16:00.960
Please take the stand.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.529
You think you can 
make a case?

16:03.529 --> 16:06.565
If I can get this girl in front of a jury 
before her wounds heal...

16:06.565 --> 16:09.268
my opening statement would be 
"Prosecution rests."

16:09.268 --> 16:11.937
I just wish we could get in his prior.

16:11.937 --> 16:13.339
Too prejudicial.

16:13.339 --> 16:17.910
No violence with the statutory. They 
were known to each other. No pattern.

16:17.910 --> 16:21.814
Siobhan is just this side of legal. 
He preys on teenage girls.

16:21.814 --> 16:25.442
Don't worry, 
I'll still bury this guy.

16:26.452 --> 16:28.280
I'm gonna bring them in now.

16:28.280 --> 16:31.218
If you recognize the man 
who raped you...

16:31.290 --> 16:34.281
identify him by number. 
Okay?

16:35.060 --> 16:36.295
Sorry I'm late.

16:36.295 --> 16:37.730
Thought you were 
taking time off.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.958
I took it.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.835
I don't know 
if I can do this.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.069
You're gonna do fine.

16:44.069 --> 16:46.434
Are we ready yet?

16:48.941 --> 16:50.909
Bring them in.

16:50.909 --> 16:54.377
Okay, right this way, 
gentlemen.

16:54.546 --> 16:57.241
You just take your time.

17:03.889 --> 17:07.550
Siobhan, do you recognize anyone?

17:15.233 --> 17:17.202
It's okay, 
just say the number.

17:17.202 --> 17:21.898
Excuse me. Move away 
from the witness, please.

17:30.015 --> 17:31.583
Number four.

17:31.583 --> 17:33.519
Which number?

17:33.519 --> 17:35.187
Number four.

17:35.187 --> 17:38.417
Now, where do you 
recognize him from?

17:39.458 --> 17:42.289
That's the man who raped me.

17:50.936 --> 17:52.905
Excuse me, there a detective 
I can talk to?

17:52.905 --> 17:56.169
- About?
- Russell Ramsay.

17:56.208 --> 17:58.444
Have a seat Ms...

17:58.444 --> 18:01.173
Leevak. Shelly Leevak.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.751
I guess you heard about Ramsay 
getting arrested again, huh?

18:05.751 --> 18:07.953
He's not a rapist.

18:07.953 --> 18:09.555
- Miss Leevak... 
- Shelly.

18:09.555 --> 18:13.192
That would hold a lot more weight 
if he wasn't convicted of raping you.

18:13.192 --> 18:16.095
It wasn't rape. 
He was my boyfriend.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.364
My parents only filed the charges 
because they wanted us to be apart.

18:19.364 --> 18:20.632
He was only 22.

18:20.632 --> 18:22.835
And you were 15. 
He's a predator.

18:22.835 --> 18:27.372
He's a nice guy. I know 
he didn't do anything to that skank.

18:27.372 --> 18:29.741
You still have feelings 
for this man?

18:29.741 --> 18:32.038
I love him.

18:32.444 --> 18:35.708
Did Ramsay ask you 
to come down here?

18:36.281 --> 18:37.950
I would've anyway.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.819
He looked me in the eye 
and he said he didn't do it.

18:40.819 --> 18:45.346
He looked me in the eye and said that 
he had sexual intercourse with the victim.

18:46.725 --> 18:49.283
He cheated on me?

18:50.596 --> 18:54.166
Only because I cheated on him first. 
We broke up a few days before.

18:54.166 --> 18:56.335
A classic trigger for a rapist.

18:56.335 --> 18:58.770
Traumatic event in 
an interpersonal relationship.

18:58.770 --> 19:02.174
To regain control, 
he overpowers another woman.

19:02.174 --> 19:04.869
He said he didn't do it.

19:05.344 --> 19:07.346
There should be 
a special level of hell...

19:07.346 --> 19:11.416
for this pus-sucking, gangrenous 
malignancy of a mental amoeba.

19:11.416 --> 19:14.096
Somebody steal 
your parking space again?

19:14.096 --> 19:18.323
Ramsay just sent in his first victim 
to defend him against his second.

19:18.323 --> 19:20.058
From the statutory rape case?

19:20.058 --> 19:22.761
Shelly Leevak? The sweet little thing 
he deflowered at 15?

19:22.761 --> 19:24.997
She's five years older 
but none the wiser.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.633
Don't tell me she's trying to alibi him?

19:27.633 --> 19:29.234
Everything but.

19:29.234 --> 19:32.271
Explain to me how schmoes 
like us spend every night at home alone...

19:32.271 --> 19:35.007
watching the History Channel, 
while a scum like Ramsay...

19:35.007 --> 19:37.898
has this nice girl's complete devotion.

19:37.898 --> 19:39.978
She is so convinced.

19:39.978 --> 19:45.847
If there is any karma, Ramsay won't be 
doing much sitting down at Rikers.

19:47.586 --> 19:50.843
Listen, Thorpe security called.

19:50.843 --> 19:53.353
You're finished with 
that video equipment, right?

19:57.396 --> 20:00.193
Take a look at this.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.027
What?

20:09.575 --> 20:12.975
Let's travel back in time 
a few minutes.

20:14.746 --> 20:16.081
Yeah?

20:16.081 --> 20:19.318
The desk clerk, Terry Wilde, 
said he came over to look for celebrities.

20:19.318 --> 20:21.386
So why is he looking 
in the opposite direction...

20:21.386 --> 20:24.752
for five minutes? 
And why this?

20:29.294 --> 20:32.524
They looked 
right at each other.

20:33.765 --> 20:37.233
And Wilde watches Ramsay 
all the way out.

20:39.789 --> 20:43.508
THORPE PALACE HOTEL
726 WEST 49TH STREET
FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 8

20:43.508 --> 20:46.578
Terry Wilde has been terminated.

20:46.578 --> 20:47.646
What'd he do...

20:47.646 --> 20:51.883
aside from keeping the victim from the 
cameras, thereby saving your five-star ass?

20:51.883 --> 20:56.054
He gave us no choice. He hasn't shown 
up for work since the event.

20:56.054 --> 21:00.492
How convenient. The only employee 
that can testify in court.

21:00.492 --> 21:02.628
What you're inferring is preposterous.

21:02.628 --> 21:04.997
Implying. You did infer what he implied.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.332
But on the bright side, 
you did infer correctly.

21:07.332 --> 21:11.790
Do you have Wilde's current address, 
or did that disappear, too?

21:12.137 --> 21:14.502
It's in his file...

21:16.041 --> 21:18.508
which you may keep.

21:18.710 --> 21:20.812
He lives at 1634 Broadway.

21:20.812 --> 21:24.149
Not unless he's one of the nuts lobbying 
for yet another extension of Cats.

21:24.149 --> 21:25.917
That's the Winter Garden Theater.

21:25.917 --> 21:27.152
Don't ask.

21:27.152 --> 21:29.021
Why would he give a bogus address?

21:29.021 --> 21:32.285
Why, indeed? 
What else you got?

21:33.525 --> 21:35.852
Former employment.

21:35.852 --> 21:39.040
THE PARK SHERIDAN HOTEL
12 CENTRAL PARK SOUTH
FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 8

21:40.465 --> 21:42.901
Hi, we need to speak to a supervisor.

21:42.901 --> 21:45.368
Mr. Fitzpatrick.

21:45.537 --> 21:49.665
We need to ask you 
about a former employee. Terry Wilde.

21:50.842 --> 21:53.578
- Take it you had a problem with Terry?
- No, never.

21:53.578 --> 21:57.749
Under what circumstances 
did he leave? / Terry never left.

21:57.749 --> 22:01.877
I'm Terry Wilde. 
What did I do?

22:06.792 --> 22:10.228
So who is this desk clerk, 
Terry Wilde? / Not a clue.

22:10.228 --> 22:13.298
Explains his reticence to testify in court. 
He's working some angle.

22:13.298 --> 22:16.668
Yeah, which he aborts when he becomes 
a witness in an unconnected crime?

22:16.668 --> 22:19.237
- Come on, what are the odds?
- I don't know, astronomical?

22:19.237 --> 22:23.608
Front desk, room key, no forced entry. 
Put me down for $100 on "connected."

22:23.608 --> 22:25.243
I'll put his photo out there.

22:25.243 --> 22:28.609
Benson, Stabler. A minute?

22:33.985 --> 22:35.721
This is Mr. Tupper.

22:35.721 --> 22:36.822
- Hi. 
- Hello.

22:36.822 --> 22:39.991
He's an actuary 
for Mr. Thorpe's insurance carrier.

22:39.991 --> 22:45.097
Mr. Tupper was just asking how strong 
the Miller case against Ramsay is.

22:45.097 --> 22:46.398
And why is that?

22:46.398 --> 22:49.067
The hotel, while admitting no liability...

22:49.067 --> 22:52.053
is considering making restitution.

22:52.053 --> 22:53.105
That's big of them.

22:53.105 --> 22:55.273
Fiscal sense 
in these litigious times.

22:55.273 --> 22:58.377
Which Mr. Thorpe would settle 
out of court.

22:58.377 --> 22:59.544
And out of the papers.

22:59.544 --> 23:02.147
I just crunch the numbers.

23:02.147 --> 23:03.815
And put price tags 
on people's lives.

23:03.815 --> 23:06.918
I simply follow 
the actuarial charts.

23:06.918 --> 23:09.554
They cover 
every conceivable contingency.

23:09.554 --> 23:12.613
Oh, yeah? 
What's a dead cop worth?

23:12.758 --> 23:15.783
I'll need rank and age at death.

23:16.536 --> 23:19.552
RIKERS ISLAND
MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 11

23:24.336 --> 23:26.701
What's his name?

23:27.239 --> 23:29.975
I don't know. Is this the guy 
you think did it?

23:29.975 --> 23:33.779
He's your partner. 
He gave you her room key, didn't he?

23:33.779 --> 23:36.348
What? No, 
she gave it to me.

23:36.348 --> 23:40.613
They checked out your story. 
Nobody at the bar remembers seeing you.

23:41.286 --> 23:43.188
I got a forgettable face.

23:43.188 --> 23:46.191
Mr. Ramsay, we will find your partner, 
with or without your help.

23:46.191 --> 23:48.927
I'm sure he will be willing 
to take the deal we're offering you.

23:48.927 --> 23:51.463
My client maintains his innocence.

23:51.463 --> 23:54.199
You're facing rape-one with 
a prior felony conviction.

23:54.199 --> 23:57.202
Given the degree of excessive force, 
you're looking at 25 years.

23:57.202 --> 24:01.968
Why won't you listen? 
I don't have a partner.

24:03.742 --> 24:06.334
What are you offering?

24:06.812 --> 24:10.975
If he gives up his partner, 
I'll recommend some leniency.

24:17.289 --> 24:20.382
Well? What's it gonna be?

24:22.327 --> 24:26.057
Looks like we'll be taking 
our chances at trial.

24:28.900 --> 24:31.265
This is so wrong.

24:33.428 --> 24:36.107
DELANCEY ARMS HOTEL
313 DELANCEY STREET
TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 12

24:36.107 --> 24:38.210
It's $20 for a tip-off.

24:38.210 --> 24:41.746
If this guy turns out to be 
our Terry Wilde, he'll give you $30.

24:41.746 --> 24:44.850
He's not a logged-in informant. 
This comes out of my pocket.

24:44.850 --> 24:45.984
You sure it's the guy?

24:45.984 --> 24:48.854
Like I said, as soon as the guy showed 
me the picture, I said "2E."

24:48.854 --> 24:50.989
I mean, if it's not him, 
it's his twin brother.

24:50.989 --> 24:53.658
- We don't pay out for brothers.
- No, it's him!

24:53.658 --> 24:57.162
He wasn't by any chance wearing 
desk clerk uniform when he checked in?

24:57.162 --> 25:00.665
Like I said, when he signed in, 
it wasn't Terry Wilde.

25:00.665 --> 25:03.502
The ID said Michael Berkman.

25:03.502 --> 25:06.527
I'm telling you, 
that's the guy.

25:07.672 --> 25:12.640
What? / Yeah, it's the manager. 
You got a phone call.

25:13.979 --> 25:16.276
You get a name?

25:16.414 --> 25:18.472
Police!

25:18.517 --> 25:20.285
Is there a problem?

25:20.285 --> 25:22.354
Yeah, you didn't give 
the hotel two weeks notice.

25:22.354 --> 25:23.588
Shame on you, 
Mr. Wilde.

25:23.588 --> 25:25.690
His Wilde days are over. 
This is Mr. Berkman now.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.592
Got a lot of names there, 
don't you, fella?

25:27.592 --> 25:29.761
You got no right to come in here. 
Get the hell out!

25:29.761 --> 25:32.197
Yes, okay, we will. 
But you're coming with us.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.632
You can't do this!

25:33.632 --> 25:36.122
Judge says we can.

25:36.935 --> 25:41.540
Detective, I got 
a shady-looking skell up in 4F.

25:41.540 --> 25:45.004
- Any interest?
- Yeah, okay.

25:45.443 --> 25:48.847
I don't know what kind of hold 
this guy has on Ramsay...

25:48.847 --> 25:50.782
but he won't give up 
his partner's name.

25:50.782 --> 25:52.350
It's Michael Berkman.

25:52.350 --> 25:54.853
Fin and Munch picked him up 
at a fleabag on Delancey.

25:54.853 --> 25:57.355
We're running his prints 
right now.

25:57.355 --> 26:01.026
If you have no connection to Ramsay, 
why'd you use a false identity at the hotel?

26:01.026 --> 26:04.496
To get work. 
He had a great resume. / She.

26:04.496 --> 26:07.532
I got it off the Internet. 
I was desperate for a job.

26:07.532 --> 26:09.634
It was a good one. 
So why'd you leave?

26:09.634 --> 26:10.936
Is quitting against the law?

26:10.936 --> 26:14.239
It is highly suspect, following so closely 
the commission of a crime.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.608
You have nothing connecting 
my client to your rapist.

26:16.608 --> 26:19.644
We have a detective and an ADA 
with him right now.

26:19.644 --> 26:21.379
Trust me, 
you wanna spill first.

26:21.379 --> 26:25.517
I swear I'm not partners with any rapist. 
I never met Russell Ramsay.

26:25.517 --> 26:26.651
I never gave him a key.

26:26.651 --> 26:28.553
Mr. Berkman, you helped facilitate a rape.

26:28.553 --> 26:30.989
Do you realize we could charge you 
as a co-conspirator?

26:30.989 --> 26:36.242
Please! The most you got 
is criminal impersonation. A misdemeanor.

26:36.628 --> 26:39.892
Guys, a minute of your time.

26:46.972 --> 26:51.576
Your Michael Berkman, formerly Terry Wilde, 
is in reality Kyle Kivlahan...

26:51.576 --> 26:53.745
disreputable roofer and petty thief.

26:53.745 --> 26:55.580
What's his connection to Ramsay?

26:55.580 --> 26:58.116
His connection is not 
to Ramsay. It's to Beau.

26:58.116 --> 27:00.418
They went to the same high school 
and juvenile facilities

27:00.418 --> 27:02.120
down in North Carolina.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.989
Looks like these guys are partners.

27:03.989 --> 27:07.822
You saying her own brother 
set her up to be raped?

27:09.427 --> 27:14.099
I just got off the phone with Tupper. 
The brother is threatening a lawsuit.

27:14.099 --> 27:17.067
$10 million.

27:20.710 --> 27:22.774
THORPE PALACE HOTEL
726 WEST 49TH STREET
WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 13

27:22.774 --> 27:24.743
Beau took the girls shopping.

27:24.743 --> 27:26.878
We're doing everything we can 
to keep Siobhan busy.

27:26.878 --> 27:29.648
Otherwise, I think 
she'd go crazy.

27:29.648 --> 27:33.051
Sounds like a great brother. 
Have they always been close?

27:33.051 --> 27:38.123
Actually, they just got back in touch. 
He left home when she was Tara's age.

27:38.123 --> 27:40.725
Why was he estranged 
from his family?

27:40.725 --> 27:45.163
I don't know the whole story. 
He was 16. He was a kid.

27:45.163 --> 27:47.098
When did he reconcile?

27:47.098 --> 27:50.535
He never got to. Their parents died 
a couple of months ago...

27:50.535 --> 27:52.904
and he was determined 
to make it up to Siobhan.

27:52.904 --> 27:54.305
Was that the point of this trip?

27:54.305 --> 27:57.475
Yeah, family reunion.

27:57.475 --> 27:59.411
Pretty serious boo-boo 
you got there.

27:59.411 --> 28:02.614
Tara gave me first aid.

28:02.614 --> 28:04.916
Guess I'm a little too old 
for the jungle gym.

28:04.916 --> 28:08.353
Your husband called 
this place "Hotel Hell."

28:08.353 --> 28:09.954
I'm surprised 
you haven't moved out.

28:09.954 --> 28:13.752
Oh, we're in a different room, 
of course!

28:15.627 --> 28:18.697
What, I do the wrong room, 
or is this rapist going door to door now?

28:18.697 --> 28:22.167
No, just lift every print you can. 
We're trying to place Ramsay in here.

28:22.167 --> 28:26.179
It's a long shot. Odds are Beau 
met with him outside this hotel.

28:26.179 --> 28:28.039
We've been assuming 
that Ramsay got a room key...

28:28.039 --> 28:30.442
from our multiple-personality 
desk clerk.

28:30.442 --> 28:32.110
But maybe he didn't even 
need a key.

28:32.110 --> 28:34.839
These are adjoining rooms.

28:36.314 --> 28:39.942
Okay, Mrs. Miller had Siobhan 
at the pool...

28:42.387 --> 28:45.480
and Beau let him in through here.

28:47.092 --> 28:48.506
Or here.

28:56.067 --> 28:58.591
We got a blood stain.

29:01.473 --> 29:04.776
Harry. / We know Beau was at the party 
from the videotape.

29:04.776 --> 29:06.878
Mrs. Miller, though, 
was definitely in this room.

29:06.878 --> 29:10.312
Making it even more 
of a family affair.

29:14.119 --> 29:16.609
How'd you meet Beau?

29:17.222 --> 29:19.190
Beau who?

29:19.190 --> 29:21.259
What about Patricia Ann?

29:21.259 --> 29:24.996
Look, I don't know her. 
And I swear to God I never touched her.

29:24.996 --> 29:26.331
You gotta get me out of here.

29:26.331 --> 29:28.730
Kyle Kivlahan?

29:29.100 --> 29:31.136
Okay, yes, I know him.

29:31.136 --> 29:33.626
How do you know him?

29:35.006 --> 29:36.995
Please?

29:37.075 --> 29:41.579
I'll say anything. 
You just tell me what you want to hear.

29:41.579 --> 29:44.549
Like you told Shelly 
you didn't rape Siobhan?

29:44.549 --> 29:46.618
I love Shelly. 
I never lie to her.

29:46.618 --> 29:49.954
Really? 'Cause when she found out 
you had sex with Siobhan...

29:49.954 --> 29:52.524
it came as a bit 
of a surprise.

29:52.524 --> 29:56.194
Look, I'm guilty of bad judgment, all right? 
That's it.

29:56.194 --> 29:58.630
Siobhan propositioned me, 
I accepted.

29:58.630 --> 30:02.793
Now I get the crap 
beat out of me every day for it.

30:03.067 --> 30:05.270
You gotta help me.

30:05.270 --> 30:09.967
You've done a stint before. 
Didn't you learn how to cover your back?

30:11.242 --> 30:15.547
It's worse this time. Come on. 
Rape and battery of a minor?

30:15.547 --> 30:17.649
Look, I can't sleep, 
all right?

30:17.649 --> 30:22.637
I gotta stay awake at night 
so I don't get ambushed.

30:22.637 --> 30:25.123
You should have remembered the pecking 
order... before you raped Siobhan.

30:25.123 --> 30:27.920
I didn't rape her!

30:28.960 --> 30:31.860
Try to stay 
out of fights, huh?

30:32.797 --> 30:34.786
How?

30:36.201 --> 30:39.829
I can't look at a guy 
without getting jumped.

30:47.779 --> 30:51.182
Munch. Benson just filled me in. 
You got anything new?

30:51.182 --> 30:52.417
Something's not right.

30:52.417 --> 30:53.785
With the brother?

30:53.785 --> 30:54.752
No, Ramsay.

30:54.752 --> 30:56.955
Don't tell me that. 
Ramsay's our only slam-dunk.

30:56.955 --> 30:58.957
It's Kyle and Beau 
I need more on to indict.

30:58.957 --> 31:02.327
Have you noticed how the bad guys are 
multiplying exponentially on this case?

31:02.327 --> 31:03.761
I just wanna make sure 
we get 'em right.

31:03.761 --> 31:05.263
It doesn't get righter 
than Ramsay.

31:05.263 --> 31:08.266
We've got the victim's ID, 
we've got his DNA, not to mention his prior.

31:08.266 --> 31:11.669
- Not-to-mention-his-prior came to see me. 
- Shelly Leevak? Why?

31:11.669 --> 31:15.240
She came to defend her rapist. 
How many times do you see that?

31:15.240 --> 31:17.375
I've seen battered wives 
defend their husbands.

31:17.375 --> 31:20.845
I've seen abused children defend 
their parents. You name it, I've seen it.

31:20.845 --> 31:24.905
Do me a favor, will you? 
Concentrate on Beau and Kyle.

31:28.319 --> 31:29.988
The flowers were really nice.

31:29.988 --> 31:32.457
Olivia, what are you doing here?

31:32.457 --> 31:34.659
I'm just working 
the rest of my shift.

31:34.659 --> 31:36.127
I told you to take time off.

31:36.127 --> 31:38.229
I don't want any time off.

31:38.229 --> 31:41.356
At least take 
the rest of the day.

31:48.539 --> 31:50.408
Look...

31:50.408 --> 31:54.245
Captain, it took me years to accept 
the fact that my mother was an alcoholic...

31:54.245 --> 31:58.416
and, when I did, 
I had to accept all the consequences.

31:58.416 --> 32:01.850
I can handle it. 
I just need to work.

32:08.793 --> 32:13.354
We're pretty sure Siobhan's brother 
and sister-in-law set her up.

32:14.966 --> 32:16.367
I wanna talk to Siobhan.

32:16.367 --> 32:18.536
No. She can't know yet.

32:18.536 --> 32:20.571
We can't take the chance 
it'll tip them off.

32:20.571 --> 32:24.563
Chance of what? Chance that 
I'll blow the case?

32:24.709 --> 32:26.611
Look, you're in no condition.

32:26.611 --> 32:31.809
Captain, I'm fine. 
Let me do my job.

32:41.759 --> 32:44.488
You're okay staying here?

32:45.296 --> 32:47.598
I just wanna go home.

32:47.598 --> 32:49.634
I think you should.

32:49.634 --> 32:53.125
Beau wants to get everything 
settled first.

32:53.471 --> 32:56.666
I can't believe 
he's suing them.

32:57.508 --> 33:01.068
How old were you 
when your brother left home?

33:03.147 --> 33:04.315
Like four.

33:04.315 --> 33:09.087
So, you never knew him 
growing up? / No.

33:09.087 --> 33:12.783
And, how is it that 
he got back into your life?

33:14.025 --> 33:18.688
Well, when our parents died, 
Beau came back.

33:19.163 --> 33:22.529
He said he'll take care of me.

33:27.038 --> 33:31.131
Sorry, I'll be right back.
Okay.

34:13.985 --> 34:16.320
No!

34:16.320 --> 34:18.623
I don't think that's enough.

34:18.623 --> 34:21.426
You just remember, 
no matter what you settle for...

34:21.426 --> 34:25.862
I am getting my $2 million, 
'cause I sure as hell did my part.

34:28.466 --> 34:33.061
So we move Siobhan 
from victim...

34:33.237 --> 34:34.338
to perp.

34:34.338 --> 34:36.507
Along with her brother, 
Beau Miller.

34:36.507 --> 34:39.510
Yeah, a.k.a., Clayton Farnsworth. 
Forgery and fraud.

34:39.510 --> 34:43.313
You know, I talked to North Carolina. 
Nothing but a petty con artist.

34:43.313 --> 34:47.618
He works the beach tourists in summer, 
home improvement scams in the off-season.

34:47.618 --> 34:50.021
Married to Patricia Ann Miller.

34:50.021 --> 34:53.391
The bloody print we found on the adjoining 
door we thought was Ramsay's?

34:53.391 --> 34:56.060
Lab ran it against the elimination prints. 
It's Patricia Ann's.

34:56.060 --> 34:59.030
But what was she doing there? 
Why risk contaminating the crime scene?

34:59.030 --> 35:01.466
To make it look like one. 
She trashed the place.

35:01.466 --> 35:04.368
Not to mention our phony 
desk clerk, Kyle Kivlahan.

35:04.368 --> 35:06.871
A.k.a. Terry Wilde 
and Michael Berkman.

35:06.871 --> 35:10.007
Who we now know to be 
Beau Miller's second cousin.

35:10.007 --> 35:12.443
Which also makes him 
Siobhan's cousin. / Yes.

35:12.443 --> 35:14.378
One big happy family of grifters.

35:14.378 --> 35:18.082
Thorpe is the mark. Let's get arrest 
warrants for the Miller family.

35:18.082 --> 35:20.485
Better call Children's Services. 
There's a 4-year-old.

35:20.485 --> 35:21.919
Thorpe would rather pay...

35:21.919 --> 35:25.423
than having us drag three handcuffed 
suspects through his family-friendly lobby.

35:25.423 --> 35:27.258
We won't be taking them in the hotel.

35:27.258 --> 35:29.760
Excuse me, we haven't 
connected all the dots yet.

35:29.760 --> 35:30.828
Who's left?

35:30.828 --> 35:33.764
Ramsay. He's not a Miller. 
He's not from North Carolina.

35:33.764 --> 35:36.231
How does he fit in?

35:37.677 --> 35:41.025
WHEDON & MAYFIELD
INSURANCE COMPANY
46 WHITEHALL STREET
THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 14

35:41.572 --> 35:46.008
We're here to pick up a check. 
Beau Miller? Regarding Siobhan?

35:49.547 --> 35:52.447
Mr. Miller's here to see you.

35:57.121 --> 35:59.349
Mr. Miller.

35:59.790 --> 36:04.028
My supervisor actually needs 
to handle transactions of this magnitude.

36:04.028 --> 36:06.256
Come with me.

36:07.365 --> 36:11.102
I can take your little girl 
to our day-care facility if you'd like.

36:11.102 --> 36:12.904
This won't take long, 
will it?

36:12.904 --> 36:16.974
We need to go over some delicate issues. 
It might be best.

36:16.974 --> 36:18.276
All right.

36:18.276 --> 36:20.344
Okay, now, Mommy will be back 
in just a second...

36:20.344 --> 36:22.180
and I want you to go 
with the nice lady.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.704
- Okay? 
- Okay.

36:27.885 --> 36:31.786
Mr. Mayfield? 
These are the Millers.

36:32.290 --> 36:34.892
Thank you, Tupper. 
You can go.

36:34.892 --> 36:36.928
- Welcome.
- Hello.

36:36.928 --> 36:39.430
Please, I can't tell you 
how glad I am...

36:39.430 --> 36:42.667
to be putting this unpleasant situation 
behind us.

36:42.667 --> 36:45.369
You just need to sign these.

36:45.369 --> 36:52.710
It is a detailed account 
of the event...as you relayed it to us.

36:52.710 --> 36:55.541
And we get that check today?

36:55.713 --> 36:59.113
Unless you wanna 
drop the claim.

37:08.492 --> 37:10.959
We're done in here.

37:14.131 --> 37:16.598
What is this?

37:18.236 --> 37:23.007
You're under arrest for conspiracy, 
extortion, and grand larceny.

37:23.007 --> 37:27.311
No one say anything without lawyers. 
Nothing, Siobhan.

37:27.311 --> 37:30.414
I don't understand. 
What'd I do?

37:30.414 --> 37:32.683
Why don't you tell me more 
about your dead parents?

37:32.683 --> 37:36.914
They're alive and doing time. 
Investment scams, wasn't it?

37:37.388 --> 37:40.925
I was ashamed. That's why 
I said they were dead.

37:40.925 --> 37:44.929
You ashamed of your age too? 
'Cause we know you're 23, not 17.

37:44.929 --> 37:48.193
And we know 
you participated in this.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.135
Beau made me.

37:51.135 --> 37:55.866
You don't know what they put me through. 
I didn't know what to do.

37:56.073 --> 37:59.744
- Please!
- You're good.

37:59.744 --> 38:03.179
- But I've been taken by better.
- No!

38:06.717 --> 38:09.048
I want a deal.

38:10.588 --> 38:12.857
Our cousin Kyle's job 
was to get inside.

38:12.857 --> 38:16.260
Once he was, he bumped 
a confirmed reservation and got us in.

38:16.260 --> 38:19.251
So how's Ramsay 
related to you?

38:20.264 --> 38:22.233
He's not.

38:22.233 --> 38:25.603
We found him 
on the Sex Offenders Registry.

38:25.603 --> 38:27.672
The sex was consensual. 
We set him up.

38:27.672 --> 38:31.698
And beating you to a pulp 
was what, foreplay?

38:31.776 --> 38:35.780
That was Patty Ann. 
She came in after he left.

38:35.780 --> 38:39.583
It hurt like hell, 
but she did a damn good job.

38:39.583 --> 38:40.951
I mean, 
that's pretty much it.

38:40.951 --> 38:43.788
Timed it so I got downstairs 
right in the middle of the opening...

38:43.788 --> 38:46.757
and then Kyle was in place to stop me 
just before I hit the press.

38:46.757 --> 38:49.860
Why? Wouldn't that have made 
a stronger civil suit?

38:49.860 --> 38:52.229
Oh, maybe, 
but those take years.

38:52.229 --> 38:55.599
I mean, we knew Thorpe would pay 
to keep it quiet, you know?

38:55.599 --> 38:57.335
And gag money pays real quick.

38:57.335 --> 39:00.271
You'll have to allocute to all 
of this when you plead guilty.

39:00.271 --> 39:04.900
Testify against all the other players, 
you're looking at probation.

39:06.911 --> 39:11.210
What was going through your mind when 
you were taking that beating?

39:11.716 --> 39:14.980
How I was gonna 
spend all that money.

39:16.187 --> 39:17.655
She get the deal?

39:17.655 --> 39:19.090
Yeah.
³×

39:19.090 --> 39:21.092
She admit to being 
the ringleader?

39:21.092 --> 39:24.695
Four separate interviews, 
one common thread: Siobhan set this up.

39:24.695 --> 39:26.764
The original scam was planned 
with the parents.

39:26.764 --> 39:28.966
Once they got pinched, 
she needed a replacement family.

39:28.966 --> 39:30.668
So she calls up 
her long-lost brother.

39:30.668 --> 39:32.036
Who, if you hear him 
tell it...

39:32.036 --> 39:34.505
had to be browbeaten 
into making the jump into the big time.

39:34.505 --> 39:35.840
And then she gets probation?

39:35.840 --> 39:37.641
I'll tell you, it gets worse:

39:37.641 --> 39:39.477
She set Ramsay up.

39:39.477 --> 39:42.480
Now, we gotta call Corrections, 
have him produced and released.

39:42.480 --> 39:44.682
I guarantee you 
he's looking at another 24 hours...

39:44.682 --> 39:46.717
before he makes it 
through the red tape.

39:46.717 --> 39:49.810
Then we need 
to put a rush on it.

39:50.065 --> 39:52.790
ALLOCUTION HEARING
FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 15

39:52.790 --> 39:55.960
Beau made sure the police and hospital 
documented the rape...

39:55.960 --> 40:00.631
and then waited for them to arrest Ramsay 
and find out he was a convicted rapist.

40:00.631 --> 40:04.201
And, and soon as they did, 
Beau began the con.

40:04.201 --> 40:06.566
That's about it.

40:06.737 --> 40:09.440
Are the People satisfied?

40:09.440 --> 40:10.574
Miss Cabot?

40:10.574 --> 40:15.704
Could Miss Miller elaborate on how 
Russell Ramsay was enrolled in the scam?

40:16.046 --> 40:19.150
That's covered under 
the agreement, right? / Right.

40:21.085 --> 40:23.687
We just looked on the Internet 
for a sex offender.

40:23.687 --> 40:26.657
I mean, they got a whole website 
with pictures and MOs...

40:26.657 --> 40:29.593
and I picked Ramsay because 
he wasn't as gross as the others.

40:29.593 --> 40:32.129
I mean, he didn't look dangerous 
and he liked them young.

40:32.129 --> 40:34.832
How did you go about 
seducing him?

40:34.832 --> 40:36.667
Our cousin Kyle 
was the advance man.

40:36.667 --> 40:39.603
I mean, he followed him around 
a few days and got his schedule down.

40:39.603 --> 40:41.772
And then, I just showed up at his bar.

40:41.772 --> 40:44.141
I gave him the duplicate room key 
that Kyle had made...

40:44.141 --> 40:46.510
and I told him when to be in my room.

40:46.510 --> 40:51.446
The plan hinged on Ramsay showing up. 
How could you be certain he would?

40:52.116 --> 40:54.852
He's an ex-con with a loser job 
who likes young girls.

40:54.852 --> 40:56.787
I mean, it's a no-brainer.

40:56.787 --> 40:59.618
Still, something could've gone wrong.

41:00.057 --> 41:02.460
I would've Plan-B'd it.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.927
What is Plan B?

41:05.062 --> 41:09.361
Honey, no man passes up free sex.

41:11.735 --> 41:16.607
Siobhan Miller, you've entered 
a change of plea from not guilty to guilty.

41:16.607 --> 41:20.911
Are you pleading guilty because you are, 
in fact, guilty of the charges?

41:20.911 --> 41:22.179
Yes, Your Honor.

41:22.179 --> 41:24.682
Given your life-long vocation 
of flimflamming...

41:24.682 --> 41:29.119
this court is loathe to put you on the stand 
of your co-conspirators' trials.

41:29.119 --> 41:32.656
However, since your plea seems 
acceptable to the DA...

41:32.656 --> 41:35.059
this court will sentence you 
to five years probation.

41:39.263 --> 41:40.598
What are you doing?

41:40.598 --> 41:43.300
Can't tell you how much 
I've enjoyed watching you hang yourself.

41:43.300 --> 41:45.569
What? We had a deal. 
You can't go back on it.

41:45.569 --> 41:47.271
Russell Ramsay 
was attacked at Rikers.

41:47.271 --> 41:48.739
He was beaten and raped.

41:48.739 --> 41:50.474
He was killed.

41:50.474 --> 41:52.510
Your false allegation 
put him there.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.745
Under the law, 
you're responsible for his death.

41:54.745 --> 41:59.044
And manslaughter ain't covered 
under your deal, sweetheart.

42:01.652 --> 42:04.388
They got her, Munch. 
She played right into it.

42:04.388 --> 42:06.090
What are the chances it'll stick?

42:06.090 --> 42:09.193
Cabot'll get her allocution testimony 
in front of the grand jury.

42:09.193 --> 42:10.728
No way they won't indict.

42:10.728 --> 42:11.829
That's great.

42:11.829 --> 42:13.964
John. We got her.

42:13.964 --> 42:16.454
Yeah? At what price?

42:19.101 --> 42:22.112
UNIFIED SHIPPING
REGO PARK, NEW YORK
FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 16

42:29.547 --> 42:32.917
What are you doing here? 
I thought I told you everything.

42:32.917 --> 42:34.685
I know you did. 
And you were right.

42:34.685 --> 42:36.420
What? You mean...

42:36.420 --> 42:39.256
We know that Ramsay didn't rape 
that woman. He's been cleared.

42:39.256 --> 42:41.621
Thank God.

42:46.797 --> 42:48.599
What?

42:48.599 --> 42:51.602
Can you take a break for a few minutes, 
have a cup of coffee with me?

42:51.602 --> 42:54.900
I need to talk to you 
about something.

42:59.910 --> 43:01.899
What?
