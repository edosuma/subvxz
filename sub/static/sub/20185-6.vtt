WEBVTT

00:07.507 --> 00:10.642
Tom Sullivan was family to me,

00:10.644 --> 00:12.444
to us.

00:12.446 --> 00:14.346
I grew up
being rocked on his knee,

00:14.348 --> 00:16.749
sitting in front of him
on his horse.

00:16.751 --> 00:18.617
And daddy was gone
most of the time,

00:18.619 --> 00:21.153
so it was tom who taught
my brothers and... and me

00:21.155 --> 00:24.123
how to ride and shoot.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.724
And I can't think
of a single good time

00:25.726 --> 00:29.294
I ever had on this ranch
that didn't involve that man.

00:29.296 --> 00:32.264
I mean, he was there when...
When Sally and I got married...

00:32.266 --> 00:34.400
Amen.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.802
Was there when the kids
were born.

00:36.804 --> 00:41.407
I watched you guys grow up
on his knee just like I did.

00:41.409 --> 00:43.308
He was there
for all the bad times as well.

00:43.310 --> 00:44.510
Yes, he was.

00:44.512 --> 00:47.579
He was there that day

00:47.581 --> 00:50.749
the apache killed my...
My mother and my brother.

00:50.751 --> 00:55.054
He was the reason
Phineas and I survived.

00:55.056 --> 00:57.089
He fought like a mother bear
to protect us.

00:57.091 --> 00:59.224
Quite a soldier.

00:59.226 --> 01:00.692
He saved us...

01:00.694 --> 01:02.795
Nobody better.

01:02.797 --> 01:04.696
And I couldn't save him.

01:04.697 --> 01:09.668
And some of you might say to me,
"well, Peter, he forgives you."

01:09.670 --> 01:11.403
Right now he's living in a place

01:11.405 --> 01:14.106
where the streams run clear...

01:14.108 --> 01:15.574
and the grass is up
to your chest,

01:15.576 --> 01:18.677
- the horses never get tired.
- That's right.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.447
That's right.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.816
I don't know
if any of that is real.

01:25.718 --> 01:28.587
I used to think someone was
watching over us,

01:28.589 --> 01:30.556
but these days,
when I look around,

01:30.558 --> 01:32.724
I'm not sure about that.

01:36.263 --> 01:39.131
I'm finished.

01:40.834 --> 01:44.236
Please, carry on, brother.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.138
Of course. Can I go, too?

01:46.140 --> 01:48.107
No, you give me a moment
with your daddy.

01:48.109 --> 01:49.708
There's a good girl.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.477
<i>A reading from revelation.</i>

01:51.479 --> 01:53.779
"And I heard a voice
from heaven saying,"

01:53.781 --> 01:55.614
blessed are the dead

01:55.616 --> 01:57.883
"who die in the lord
from now on."

01:57.885 --> 02:00.519
Perhaps you should go away
for a spell.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.554
Go up to Austin, see your wife.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.756
I don't think
that's a good idea.

02:04.758 --> 02:08.293
I'm not a source of comfort
for her.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.795
It ain't her I'm worried about.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.699
Your children need a daddy.

02:13.701 --> 02:16.635
This ranch needs a leader.

02:16.637 --> 02:20.672
So whatever it takes
to get your head right,

02:20.674 --> 02:23.842
you better do it.

02:23.844 --> 02:27.513
Yes, sir. Whatever you say, sir.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:43.296 --> 02:45.497
Indians, right?

02:45.499 --> 02:48.467
Apache.

02:48.469 --> 02:51.770
You know this story?

02:51.772 --> 02:54.940
Daddy says I'm not allowed
to hear it all till I'm older.

02:54.942 --> 02:58.343
Well, you look old enough to me.

02:59.547 --> 03:00.946
It was 1881.

03:00.948 --> 03:03.282
Your daddy was about 4 or 5.

03:03.284 --> 03:06.351
There hadn't been an Indian raid
for a long while,

03:06.353 --> 03:07.853
so I thought we were safe.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.821
I'd gone up to Wichita
on some cattle business,

03:09.823 --> 03:14.826
Sullivan had buried your grandmother
and your uncle Everett.

03:15.562 --> 03:17.930
However...

03:17.932 --> 03:21.800
He did save your daddy
and uncle Phineas.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.938
<i>I took some vaqueros,
and we hunted down</i>

03:25.940 --> 03:28.807
that band of apaches
and killed them.

03:28.809 --> 03:31.243
All of them?

03:31.245 --> 03:33.245
Well, not exactly.

03:33.247 --> 03:37.482
There was one survivor,
a young boy.

03:41.387 --> 03:43.855
The last of his kind.

03:43.857 --> 03:47.960
After it was over,
we headed back home.

03:47.962 --> 03:50.395
When we got to the river,
we saw that that apache boy

03:50.397 --> 03:54.800
had been following us
with his bow.

03:59.472 --> 04:02.708
For 20 miles,

04:02.710 --> 04:05.544
he kept up
with men on horseback.

04:05.546 --> 04:09.348
For 20 miles, he'd been
running to his death.

04:12.418 --> 04:14.386
A child like that...

04:18.926 --> 04:21.959
A child like that

04:21.962 --> 04:24.796
would've been worth
a thousand men today.

04:27.033 --> 04:29.001
Where is he now?

04:31.638 --> 04:34.506
I left him standing
at the riverbank.

04:36.876 --> 04:39.578
Far as I know,
he's looking for me yet.

05:14.447 --> 05:17.015
We are living in
a historic moment, gentlemen.

05:17.017 --> 05:20.319
You will tell your children
and grandchildren

05:20.321 --> 05:22.821
about this terrible time
of violence.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.390
No, thanks.
No, thank you, darling.

05:25.392 --> 05:28.960
So the piano player
turns out to be her husband

05:28.962 --> 05:31.596
and he had a shotgun.

05:31.598 --> 05:34.066
Tom busts out of there,
buck naked,

05:34.068 --> 05:36.501
and ran all the way back
through the ranch.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.605
I must've spent half the night

05:40.607 --> 05:42.774
picking burrs
out of that man's ass.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.876
The mark of a true friend.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.779
To tom Sullivan,
may he rest in peace.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.815
Hear, hear.

05:52.919 --> 05:55.620
How are you holding up?

05:57.491 --> 05:59.458
Not great, obviously.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.761
Do you wanna talk about it?

06:02.763 --> 06:04.563
Maria...

06:05.733 --> 06:06.632
<i>SÃ­, papÃ¡.</i>

06:06.633 --> 06:09.968
Sorry for your loss.
Thank you, sir.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.076
Our house is destroyed,

06:18.078 --> 06:21.747
our brother's gunned down,
and yet, we prevail.

06:22.950 --> 06:25.117
We must mourn tom Sullivan

06:25.119 --> 06:28.687
as we find strength
in ourselves.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.956
We all have a responsibility

06:30.958 --> 06:34.559
to ensure this never, ever
happens again.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.161
Excuse me.

06:38.398 --> 06:43.135
<i>Damn shame what those sediciosos
did to this find house of yours.</i>

06:43.137 --> 06:45.637
I'm more worried about
my brother.

06:45.639 --> 06:50.575
Like I said, damn shame.

06:50.577 --> 06:53.645
Which one is Ramon?

06:53.647 --> 06:56.181
He's right there.

06:56.183 --> 06:57.916
What'd Ramon do?

06:57.918 --> 06:59.484
<i>He helped the sediciosos.</i>

06:59.486 --> 07:02.654
Led them to this very doorstep.

07:02.656 --> 07:05.624
He's having a high old time,
ain't he?

07:08.594 --> 07:11.696
He shouldn't be here. Well...

07:11.698 --> 07:14.599
Maybe somebody
oughta tell him that.

07:21.574 --> 07:24.476
Hey, Ramon, y'all probably
ought to get goin'.

07:24.478 --> 07:26.077
What's wrong?

07:26.079 --> 07:28.713
Do I gotta spell it out?

07:29.882 --> 07:32.083
I've known Sully a long time,
Charles.

07:32.085 --> 07:34.786
If I could take that bullet
for him, I would've done it.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.188
Bullshit.

07:36.190 --> 07:38.557
Browns stick with brown.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.592
<i>The sediciosos held me
at gunpoint.</i>

07:40.594 --> 07:42.861
I led them in circles until
we ran into the colonel.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.663
Of course that's what
you say now.

07:44.665 --> 07:47.999
Hey, this is
the whiskey talkin'.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.568
Let's all stay calm.

07:49.570 --> 07:52.504
It's okay. His house.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.841
I know you ain't walking away

07:55.843 --> 07:57.075
from colonel McCullough's
grandson

07:57.077 --> 07:59.044
when he's talking to you.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.979
Out of the way, Louis.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.248
I prefer "sir."

08:03.250 --> 08:06.818
I don't say "sir" to your kind.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.254
You better watch yourself, son.

08:20.066 --> 08:21.633
Hey! I said knock it off.

08:21.635 --> 08:24.636
Step back! Get back!
Keep your place!

08:24.638 --> 08:26.071
What the hell's going on here?

08:26.073 --> 08:28.874
We were set upon by your men.

08:28.876 --> 08:32.744
Your son showed great
potentiality for heroism.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.913
Niles!

08:34.914 --> 08:36.948
Time to go.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.054
He should be rightly lauded.

08:45.691 --> 08:48.093
I want you to apologize
to Ramon.

08:48.095 --> 08:51.229
That's not necessary, Mr. Pete.
It was an accident.

08:51.231 --> 08:52.731
No. Our men are family.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.699
That's... that's how
we treat 'em.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.104
I want you to apologize.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.608
Now.

09:05.077 --> 09:06.878
Listen to your daddy.

09:14.086 --> 09:16.788
I apologize, Ramon.

10:14.313 --> 10:16.281
Shit.

10:31.765 --> 10:34.633
Help! Help me!

10:36.102 --> 10:38.136
Help me.
What the hell's going on here?

10:38.138 --> 10:40.939
The comanches
got me. They killed my family.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.241
Are they still around?
They following you?

10:43.243 --> 10:47.312
No. I left them a few days ago.
They think I'm dead.

10:49.348 --> 10:53.351
Don't worry, kid.
We'll keep you safe.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.387
You hurt?

10:55.389 --> 10:57.255
No.

10:57.257 --> 10:58.823
All right, well, come on.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.126
You're welcome to join
our little camp.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.662
Take a load off your dogs.

11:03.664 --> 11:06.331
This'll be ready
in a few minutes.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.833
Come on, sit down,
get some food in you.

11:13.706 --> 11:16.107
Don't worry, kid.
It'll be all right.

11:17.744 --> 11:20.078
You're safe now.

11:21.414 --> 11:23.915
Mister, you better run.

11:25.818 --> 11:27.919
I'm serious.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.425
You little son of a bitch!

11:35.896 --> 11:38.730
Grab your rifles!

12:11.131 --> 12:12.397
Aah!

13:17.163 --> 13:20.131
I'm a Christian.
I have god on my side.

13:21.368 --> 13:22.867
What're you doing?

13:25.505 --> 13:27.572
Goddamn savages.

14:33.439 --> 14:36.140
You've earned this, tiehteti.

14:36.142 --> 14:38.476
We eat this winter
because of you.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.311
You did good.

14:42.248 --> 14:45.450
No. What are you doing?
What are you doing?!

14:45.452 --> 14:48.453
No! Please, no. No!

15:05.504 --> 15:08.606
I'm Eli.

15:08.608 --> 15:11.276
People here call me tiehteti.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.244
It means "pathetic white boy."

15:15.014 --> 15:16.915
You should eat something.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.618
Starving yourself
just makes it worse.

15:25.958 --> 15:28.226
Whether you eat or not,
they expect you to work.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.398
What's your name?

15:39.004 --> 15:42.173
Ingrid.

15:43.575 --> 15:47.211
What kind of accent is that?

15:47.213 --> 15:48.413
German.

15:48.580 --> 15:52.450
What are you doin' here?

15:52.452 --> 15:56.421
I left home with my parents
during the war.

15:56.423 --> 15:59.257
Which war?

15:59.259 --> 16:02.727
The march revolution.

16:02.729 --> 16:05.997
A man sold us some land here.

16:05.999 --> 16:08.299
We came with 20 other families.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.535
Nobody told you about
the Indians?

16:10.537 --> 16:14.539
We were told
they were only stories.

16:16.608 --> 16:18.643
Where'd you learn
how to do that?

16:18.645 --> 16:20.311
You're good at it.

16:27.187 --> 16:31.222
About a year ago, my parents
were killed by the apache.

16:31.224 --> 16:34.192
I was taken.

16:34.194 --> 16:37.128
The buffalo hunters
visited our camp

16:37.130 --> 16:39.263
and they traded for me.

16:41.233 --> 16:44.369
They were going to take me
back to civilization.

16:46.338 --> 16:49.574
I was almost free.

16:53.312 --> 16:55.113
I'm so sorry.

16:56.315 --> 16:58.549
You didn't cause this.

16:58.551 --> 17:01.019
You're just a captive like me.

17:04.423 --> 17:06.590
Right?

17:10.229 --> 17:13.631
I was the one that found
your camp.

17:13.633 --> 17:16.733
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

17:16.736 --> 17:19.369
Like I said, I'm sorry.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.541
You led them to us.

18:15.562 --> 18:18.262
How's Jonas?

18:18.264 --> 18:20.531
Healin' up.

18:20.533 --> 18:22.133
<i>Gracias.</i>

18:31.310 --> 18:33.711
He's out of danger.

18:33.713 --> 18:36.848
He's at this fancy new hospital
in Austin.

18:36.850 --> 18:41.819
45 beds.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.888
Sally's up there with him.

18:46.725 --> 18:48.459
That must be lonely for you.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.128
It's okay.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.865
We needed a little time apart.

18:57.636 --> 19:00.404
I don't think you came here
to see my father.

19:06.345 --> 19:10.148
I know the real person
I should be thanking is you.

19:10.150 --> 19:13.217
You're the one who convinced him
to come to our rescue.

19:13.219 --> 19:15.586
Had to be.

19:15.588 --> 19:19.557
It was obvious
what had to be done.

19:25.397 --> 19:28.799
So that's all this is?

19:28.801 --> 19:31.302
A thank-you visit.

19:31.304 --> 19:34.438
That's all.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.474
You know I can tell
when you're lying.

19:38.610 --> 19:41.312
Well, I know you think you can.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.818
It's strange,

19:47.820 --> 19:50.855
sitting here
and drinking coffee with you.

19:50.857 --> 19:53.424
Familiar.

19:53.426 --> 19:56.494
Yeah.

19:56.496 --> 19:59.330
That's a better word for it.

19:59.332 --> 20:03.334
So I guess you don't think much
of the old days?

20:05.804 --> 20:08.406
Nope.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.875
Me neither.

20:19.351 --> 20:23.287
Okay, Chestnut, we need
to retrace our steps exactly.

20:23.289 --> 20:24.755
You got that?

20:24.757 --> 20:27.458
It's real important.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.728
We're gonna find that oil seep.

20:30.730 --> 20:34.799
Of course we are.
I believe in you, baby girl.

20:34.801 --> 20:37.335
- Where you goin'?
- Come on.

20:38.771 --> 20:41.872
.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.782
I don't remember any of this.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.852
None of it looks familiar.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.720
Goddamn!

21:29.722 --> 21:31.589
Damn.

21:33.293 --> 21:37.795
Well, put yourself back
where you were, Jeanne Anne.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.631
You were running away.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.366
What did you feel?

21:43.636 --> 21:45.303
What did you hear?

21:50.342 --> 21:52.076
Gunfire...

21:52.078 --> 21:54.345
Coming from the ranch.

21:54.347 --> 21:57.415
So I'm guessing you would've
looked for cover,

21:57.417 --> 21:59.617
which would've led you that way.

22:01.353 --> 22:02.687
Yeah.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.355
Come on.

22:07.526 --> 22:10.094
I think I know why
those bandits came after us.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.564
The man in the shed.

22:17.069 --> 22:19.904
Do you care to elaborate?

22:19.906 --> 22:23.641
I saw the man in the shed.
He had blood all over him.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.943
Daddy put him in the truck
and just drove off.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.778
Anything your daddy's ever done,

22:27.780 --> 22:29.547
he's done for the good
of this family.

22:29.549 --> 22:32.049
Don't ever forget that.

22:32.051 --> 22:35.753
The garcÃ­as think we killed him.

22:35.755 --> 22:37.455
Did we?

22:43.829 --> 22:46.364
The world's a dangerous place,
honey.

22:47.632 --> 22:49.700
Your daddy and I tried
to protect you from that,

22:49.702 --> 22:54.405
but now that you've seen it,
you've got a choice.

22:54.407 --> 22:58.642
You can either curl up
in a little ball

22:58.644 --> 23:01.746
or make yourself stronger.

23:16.596 --> 23:19.130
Somebody help me!

23:20.866 --> 23:22.967
Help!

23:22.969 --> 23:26.670
Please, god, help me!

23:30.042 --> 23:32.510
No, no, no.

23:40.787 --> 23:42.520
Please.

23:44.689 --> 23:47.992
Is anyone there?

23:47.994 --> 23:52.797
Can anybody hear me?

23:52.799 --> 23:57.668
Can anyone understand
what I'm saying?

24:01.908 --> 24:04.608
Help me.

24:04.610 --> 24:07.745
Leave that. Walk with me.

24:07.747 --> 24:09.180
Help me.

24:09.182 --> 24:11.882
Help!

24:16.555 --> 24:18.789
You pity the new captives.

24:18.791 --> 24:22.226
I don't. You do.

24:22.228 --> 24:26.063
The buffalo hunter lost
his honor when we caught him.

24:26.065 --> 24:29.467
Torture is a chance for him
to get it back.

24:29.469 --> 24:33.504
Instead, he cries and screams.

24:33.506 --> 24:35.973
I think comanches
just like torture.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.108
All people like torture.

24:38.110 --> 24:40.845
White people, too.

24:40.847 --> 24:43.681
Nobody I know would do that.

24:43.683 --> 24:47.117
I've watched rangers kill
children in front of my eyes.

24:47.119 --> 24:48.786
"Little Indian becomes
a big Indian."

24:48.788 --> 24:51.789
That's a saying among
white people, right?

24:51.791 --> 24:55.860
It's how all people fight...
Believing the enemy's not human.

24:57.863 --> 25:01.065
What about my mother
and sister and brother?

25:01.067 --> 25:03.701
They weren't your enemies.

25:03.703 --> 25:05.569
They weren't hurting anybody.

25:05.571 --> 25:10.140
We've been on that land
since the beginning of time,

25:10.142 --> 25:13.110
and yet, you decided
it was your own.

25:13.112 --> 25:16.580
Did you not think that we would
fight to take it back?

25:16.582 --> 25:18.048
Because when I steal something
from someone,

25:18.050 --> 25:21.051
I expect they will want
to kill me.

25:21.053 --> 25:22.653
White people, they do not.

25:22.655 --> 25:23.921
They think everything
in this world

25:23.923 --> 25:26.924
rightfully belongs to them.

25:26.926 --> 25:30.160
They think they're entitled
to rob and cheat.

25:31.796 --> 25:33.531
All the white people
I've ever met

25:33.533 --> 25:35.199
tried to steal our land.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.301
And yet, I have never met
a white man

25:37.303 --> 25:39.970
who didn't look surprised
when I killed him.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.912
Please help me.

25:47.914 --> 25:49.880
Help!

25:49.882 --> 25:54.952
You deserve whatever happens
to you! You're animals!

25:54.954 --> 25:58.055
This could be the end of you.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.324
The lord will see to it!

26:08.767 --> 26:12.303
Somebody help me!

26:14.339 --> 26:16.340
Help!

26:16.342 --> 26:19.610
Is anyone there?

26:19.612 --> 26:20.978
What's wrong?

26:20.980 --> 26:23.314
Can anyone help, please?

26:23.316 --> 26:24.882
Can you not hear him out there?

26:28.120 --> 26:30.854
Are you upset
because he's white?

26:32.857 --> 26:34.758
I don't know.

26:34.760 --> 26:38.228
It's not good to discuss
this with anyone, even me.

26:38.230 --> 26:40.898
Help me.

26:40.900 --> 26:44.101
I just wanna know
how you feel about it.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.369
Help me.

26:47.106 --> 26:50.708
Can anyone hear me?

26:54.879 --> 26:58.616
I wasn't born into this band.

26:58.618 --> 27:03.754
I was born into the penateka...
Honey eaters.

27:03.756 --> 27:06.290
What happened?

27:15.400 --> 27:18.402
The white texans attacked
our camp.

27:23.341 --> 27:26.143
The men were away, and...

27:26.145 --> 27:29.046
It was just women and children.

27:32.150 --> 27:34.284
They killed everyone.

27:36.354 --> 27:38.989
They picked up my baby brother
by the neck

27:38.991 --> 27:41.692
and bashed his head
against a rock.

27:44.062 --> 27:48.098
They cut my mother's head off,

27:48.100 --> 27:50.901
stuck a spear between her legs.

27:53.738 --> 27:58.742
My sister and I... Ran.

28:01.079 --> 28:06.717
We hid in the bushes,
and we watched them

28:06.719 --> 28:09.753
kill everyone in our camp.

28:14.726 --> 28:17.161
But why would they do that?

28:17.163 --> 28:19.396
They want our land,

28:19.398 --> 28:23.000
'cause no matter how much
they have, it's not enough.

28:24.335 --> 28:26.236
You wanna know how I feel

28:26.238 --> 28:29.907
about the buffalo hunter
being in pain?

28:29.909 --> 28:32.276
I'm glad.

29:03.308 --> 29:05.809
A McCullough has entered
the bar.

29:05.811 --> 29:09.513
Louis, libate this man
post-haste.

29:09.515 --> 29:11.915
Sit you down, son.

29:14.085 --> 29:17.955
How you feelin'
this fine afternoon?

29:19.324 --> 29:20.991
Fine, I guess.

29:20.993 --> 29:23.761
This young man has weathered
a difficult spell.

29:23.763 --> 29:25.896
We'll open the gold medal.

29:27.966 --> 29:30.334
The south's
most illustrious liquor

29:30.336 --> 29:35.139
traveled 1,500 miles
to get here.

29:35.141 --> 29:36.440
Thank you, sir.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.776
It is our pleasure, Charles,

29:38.778 --> 29:41.779
to offer hospitality
to one of our comrades

29:41.781 --> 29:43.781
when he needs it most.

29:45.383 --> 29:47.184
Now that's more like it.

29:47.186 --> 29:49.486
Thank you very much, Louis.

29:54.425 --> 29:56.360
To your future.

30:02.934 --> 30:04.935
Ooh.

30:09.240 --> 30:13.177
Now you see, that is it exactly.

30:13.179 --> 30:16.980
I knew you and I were alike
in this way.

30:16.982 --> 30:19.917
Our souls feel
so damn responsible

30:19.919 --> 30:21.885
to heal the social ills.

30:21.887 --> 30:24.988
But we are buoyed
by righteousness.

30:26.925 --> 30:29.259
And yet, can you believe
your daddy frets

30:29.261 --> 30:31.562
I'm putting wrong thoughts
in your head?

30:31.564 --> 30:33.197
The hell with my dad.

30:35.401 --> 30:37.935
That's some phraseology.

30:41.439 --> 30:44.007
I can't believe

30:44.009 --> 30:46.610
he made me kiss
Ramon's brown ass

30:46.612 --> 30:48.912
in front of everyone
on the ranch.

30:48.914 --> 30:50.914
True.

30:50.916 --> 30:53.417
Your daddy never should've
done that.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.953
It was a shame
you did not deserve.

30:55.955 --> 30:58.222
It's like his head

30:58.224 --> 31:01.458
is screwed on backwards
these days.

31:03.561 --> 31:06.063
I can't explain him.

31:07.265 --> 31:12.035
Son, your daddy does not
define you.

31:13.305 --> 31:14.972
And I will admit,

31:14.974 --> 31:18.342
I have always had more in common
with your granddaddy

31:18.344 --> 31:21.979
than with anyone else
in your family.

31:21.981 --> 31:25.182
I've done a fair bit
of work for him, in fact.

31:25.184 --> 31:27.084
What kind of work?

31:27.086 --> 31:31.588
The kind your paterfamilias
lacks the stomach for.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.327
Tell me, Charles,

31:37.329 --> 31:41.331
<i>does it not bother you
that one of your own vaqueros</i>

31:41.333 --> 31:45.035
led the greaser bandits
to your front door?

31:48.673 --> 31:51.108
Hell, yeah, it bothers me.

31:56.547 --> 31:59.583
But there's not much I can
do about it, though.

32:01.953 --> 32:04.988
Well, I respectfully disagree.

32:06.958 --> 32:10.560
If you give a man a lever

32:10.562 --> 32:14.932
and a place to put it,

32:14.934 --> 32:17.167
he can move the world.

32:39.625 --> 32:43.660
Please, god, kill me!

32:47.433 --> 32:50.500
Kill me!

32:50.502 --> 32:54.504
Can anyone hear me?!

32:54.506 --> 32:57.708
Can anyone help?

34:11.417 --> 34:15.318
It's okay. I'm here to help you.

34:19.157 --> 34:21.324
This'll all be over soon.

36:14.939 --> 36:16.673
Hey, Ramon.

36:16.675 --> 36:19.176
Charles? That you?

36:19.178 --> 36:20.844
Yep.

36:20.846 --> 36:23.747
What are you doing way out here?

36:23.749 --> 36:26.416
I'm taking back that apology.

36:29.253 --> 36:30.413
Come on, Charles, time to go.

36:31.356 --> 36:33.323
No!

36:34.860 --> 36:36.960
Luisa! Luisa!

36:49.274 --> 36:52.309
You said we were just
gonna scare him.

36:52.311 --> 36:56.846
He's plenty scared.
There's no doubt on that front.

36:56.848 --> 37:01.251
Would the suspect please explain
how he led a gang of killers

37:01.253 --> 37:04.955
to the door of our community's
most prominent citizen?

37:04.957 --> 37:07.390
Charles, please.

37:07.392 --> 37:08.925
You know I wouldn't do this.

37:08.927 --> 37:13.263
I believe him.
Let him... let him go.

37:13.265 --> 37:15.298
This is about justice, Charles.

37:15.300 --> 37:16.666
I said let him go!

37:16.668 --> 37:18.602
Would the suspect please explain

37:18.604 --> 37:23.240
<i>how he turned his employer's
family over to the sediciosos?</i>

37:23.242 --> 37:26.643
Niles, come on. How he got
numerous members of our community

37:26.645 --> 37:29.679
killed or wounded.

37:29.681 --> 37:32.015
I would never
betray your family, Charles.

37:32.017 --> 37:35.385
Please let him down! Please!

37:35.387 --> 37:38.488
I like Ramon just as much
as you do,

37:38.490 --> 37:41.491
but it is the message
that matters.

37:45.696 --> 37:47.264
Stop! Please stop!

37:47.266 --> 37:48.732
Relax, son.

37:48.734 --> 37:51.301
There's a science to this.

37:51.303 --> 37:54.771
All right, come on.

37:56.808 --> 38:00.010
Yeah.

38:00.012 --> 38:03.747
Now you listen to me, Ramon.

38:05.616 --> 38:08.318
This is your last chance.

38:09.920 --> 38:13.356
You confess, and we'll take you
to the sheriff...

38:13.358 --> 38:17.594
and you can have
your day in court.

38:17.596 --> 38:20.563
But either way,

38:20.565 --> 38:23.600
you've got to answer
for what you did.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.874
Charles...

38:30.876 --> 38:33.410
I forgive you.

38:35.713 --> 38:39.416
Don't you let that copper-belly
mess with your head.

38:41.786 --> 38:43.553
Bring him up.

38:43.555 --> 38:46.589
No! No! No!

38:46.591 --> 38:48.925
Get him! No! No!

38:48.927 --> 38:51.494
No! Hey!

38:51.496 --> 38:54.798
Hey! I don't like this
any more than you do.

39:39.810 --> 39:41.578
Charles?

39:45.783 --> 39:47.884
I was worried about you.

39:49.053 --> 39:50.720
I'm all right.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.058
Have you been drinking?

39:56.794 --> 39:58.461
Hey, wait up.

40:04.101 --> 40:05.969
I'm sorry I scolded you
in front of the others.

40:05.971 --> 40:08.972
I never should've done that.

40:08.974 --> 40:13.576
My head was messed up
because of Sullivan and...

40:13.578 --> 40:15.979
Are you all right?

40:15.981 --> 40:17.647
I'm fine.

40:35.734 --> 40:37.200
Yes.

40:37.202 --> 40:40.637
I heard people and rode
straight into here.

40:50.481 --> 40:51.881
This is it.

40:57.589 --> 41:00.590
- Can I?
- Go right ahead.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.974
Let me see.

41:26.851 --> 41:28.985
I've spent my whole life
building something

41:28.987 --> 41:32.489
to leave to my family,
Jeanne Anne,

41:32.491 --> 41:34.190
and oil is the only way
I can keep it.

41:34.192 --> 41:37.727
Now a goddamn miracle
has happened.

41:37.729 --> 41:39.896
We found a spot
with so much oil,

41:39.898 --> 41:42.098
it can't even stay underground.

41:46.704 --> 41:51.040
And it's a mile on the wrong
