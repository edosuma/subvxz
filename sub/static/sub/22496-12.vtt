<i>It's alive!</i>

00:34.595 --> 00:36.485
<b>7x12 - "Noidstrom Rack"</b>

00:36.434 --> 00:38.702
Captain von Trapp,
the Hills are Alive!

00:38.704 --> 00:41.171
With the sound of music.
Yes, Maria, I know.

00:41.173 --> 00:43.207
No, you fool!
The Hills are Alive!

00:45.311 --> 00:49.179
Autobots, we must defeat Megatron.

00:49.181 --> 00:51.815
We are the Zybots!
We can also transform.

00:51.817 --> 00:56.820
- Let us help you fight.
- Uh...

00:56.822 --> 01:02.026
Brave Zybots, I am
100% sure you would die.

01:02.028 --> 01:06.697
Okay!
Well, thanks for your time.

01:06.699 --> 01:10.167
- That was just sad.
- Whew! Sorry I'm late.

01:10.169 --> 01:13.270
- Uh, who are you?
- I'm ... I'm an ... I'm an

01:13.272 --> 01:17.574
Autobot like you. My
name is Autobot... Johnson.

01:17.576 --> 01:21.045
You look exactly like the
Zybots we just spoke to hastily

01:21.047 --> 01:24.248
cobbled together to form
a bigger, weirder Zybot.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.242
Uh, okay.
Who hired this guy?

01:27.277 --> 01:28.986
Oh, shit!
Give me a second here.

01:28.988 --> 01:32.356
Ugh! Just one second!
Aah! Ugh!

01:32.358 --> 01:34.925
- There.
- If you're an Autobot, then

01:34.927 --> 01:37.361
transform with loud, showy noises.

01:37.363 --> 01:39.396
- You bet!
- Kee-Kah! Khwah!

01:40.616 --> 01:43.600
True talk ... we lied.
But we don't need your permission.

01:43.602 --> 01:47.538
We'll fight Megatron all by ourselves.

01:50.475 --> 01:54.878
- Megatron, meet the Zybots!
- Not the Zybots!

01:57.483 --> 01:59.016
We did it. We did it!

01:59.018 --> 02:03.754
- We did i-i-i-i-t!
- Megatron, what the [bleep] bro?

02:03.756 --> 02:06.056
Oh, those guys were cute.

02:06.058 --> 02:09.193
They really looked
like they needed a "W."

02:09.195 --> 02:12.262
- Where is he, Marjory?
- I don't know what you're

02:12.264 --> 02:14.932
- talking about.
- You've been cheating on me

02:14.934 --> 02:18.469
- with one of these?!
- Unh! Once you go QR code, you

02:18.471 --> 02:20.839
never take another barcode load.

02:23.209 --> 02:27.811
You do realize changing faces
has zero relevance to combat, right?

02:27.813 --> 02:32.049
Well, my fist is very relevant.

02:32.051 --> 02:35.886
Ah, I got to jet, guys.
My play is opening tonight!

02:35.888 --> 02:38.323
Rubber baby buggy bumpers.

02:38.324 --> 02:40.758
Rubber baby buggy bumpers!

02:40.760 --> 02:43.827
I can't believe he's leaving
us for his acting bullshit.

02:43.829 --> 02:46.397
Let's crash his play
and yell, "you suck!"

02:46.399 --> 02:49.099
- at inappropriate moments.
- Hey, what the [bleep] guys?

02:49.101 --> 02:51.252
[bleep] [bleep] [bleep]

02:53.406 --> 02:56.673
- What a doucheblast.
- Though cursed with

02:56.675 --> 03:00.110
a monster's face, you, Catherine ...
you've seen the man inside.

03:00.112 --> 03:02.679
How ironic that they say love is

03:02.681 --> 03:06.884
blind, because it took
love to open my eyes.

03:08.871 --> 03:10.854
He's brilliant!

03:10.856 --> 03:13.223
We had no idea you
were so talented, man.

03:13.225 --> 03:15.660
Hi, there. Herb Schwartz.

03:15.661 --> 03:18.095
You, sir, are gonna be a star.

03:18.097 --> 03:21.198
"My husband is also a robot"
is filmed before a live

03:21.200 --> 03:23.367
- studio audience.
- Steve, it's your night to do

03:23.369 --> 03:27.344
- the dishes.
- "Dishes" Does not compute.

03:27.723 --> 03:31.543
My directive is to watch football.

03:36.448 --> 03:39.516
That stunt you pulled on the
subway cost the city $18 million

03:39.518 --> 03:41.452
in damages!
Which one of you wants to

03:41.454 --> 03:45.088
- explain what happened?!
- Not it!

03:45.090 --> 03:49.493
And the best actor Oscar goes
to Man-E-Faces for

03:49.495 --> 03:53.197
"Reaching into darkness:
The story of Helen Keller's father,

03:53.199 --> 03:56.400
- Arthur Keller."
- Oh, why?!

03:56.402 --> 03:59.387
Why is my daughter's hand wet?!

03:59.388 --> 04:02.373
Who put water on my daughter's hand?!

04:02.374 --> 04:04.659
What's next?
Show me the new face.

04:04.660 --> 04:05.943
But I only have three.

04:05.945 --> 04:09.597
What the hell, man? Your name
should be "Two-more-faces."

04:09.598 --> 04:13.484
Oh, I'm so [bleep]
I signed a 95-picture deal.

04:13.486 --> 04:17.286
<i>"Mr. Monster goes to fart
school" is yet another reheated</i>

04:17.289 --> 04:19.690
<i>piece of dog crap
from Man-E-Faces.</i>

04:19.692 --> 04:22.292
Don't get too down. I love
"Mr. Monster goes to fart school."

04:22.294 --> 04:25.729
- Really?
- No, man. You fart like a hack.

04:25.731 --> 04:27.931
This is Bucky o'Hare,
requesting to land on

04:27.933 --> 04:32.069
Moonport 4-5.
One sec. Got to mate again.

04:33.539 --> 04:35.005
My apologies.

04:35.007 --> 04:38.842
Requesting to land ...
whoops. Matin' time.

04:38.844 --> 04:41.178
<i>Warning. Warning. Warning.</i>

04:45.117 --> 04:46.950
Dad, it's your son ... Sam!

04:46.952 --> 04:50.687
Dad, why did we leave the
electricity running in an arcade

04:50.689 --> 04:55.159
we closed 20 years ago
when you disappeared?!

04:55.911 --> 04:58.445
Eh, couldn't hurt.

04:58.447 --> 05:00.814
Ohh! It does hurt!
I was totally wrong!

05:00.816 --> 05:02.550
I'm so stupi...

05:05.154 --> 05:08.922
- Wh-where am I?
- You're in the digital world,

05:08.924 --> 05:12.459
like a game grid but on PCP!
I'm Koromon, a digimon!

05:12.461 --> 05:16.263
Digivolve me into a little
yellow dinosaur and we can ...

05:16.265 --> 05:19.600
Dad?! Da-a-a-a-d!

05:19.602 --> 05:22.770
Sam! Is that really you?

05:22.772 --> 05:25.372
Did you create this world?!
It's amazing!

05:25.374 --> 05:29.009
I tried to kill myself,
but they won't let me die!

05:29.011 --> 05:32.846
I curse Jesus' name, son!
I hate god so very, very much!

05:32.848 --> 05:35.182
I found you, dad!
That's what matters!

05:35.184 --> 05:38.185
I had sex with them!
Tokomon was the most gentle, but

05:38.187 --> 05:40.988
I say that within the
context of it being terrible!

05:40.990 --> 05:44.258
- Shit, dad! That is gross!
- But you're here now!

05:44.260 --> 05:46.126
We can figure a way out together!

05:46.128 --> 05:48.780
Before I came here, I told
the electric company to

05:48.781 --> 05:52.433
turn the power off! This
whole place is about to de-rez!

05:53.979 --> 05:56.804
Son, it is still a sweet release.

05:56.806 --> 05:58.839
- At last, I'll know peace.
- Ohh!

05:58.841 --> 06:01.995
<i>This isn't peaceful at all!
Oh, my god!</i>

06:02.144 --> 06:05.479
Remember, sex ed is a safe
place to ask questions

06:05.481 --> 06:06.580
with no judgment. Yes?

06:06.582 --> 06:09.616
- You have a question, Stretch?
- Uh, is it normal when you

06:09.618 --> 06:11.837
touch yourself for your penis to get

06:11.838 --> 06:14.056
longer and softer and really stringy?

06:14.057 --> 06:16.724
Because my friend asked me, and

06:16.726 --> 06:19.793
I was like, "no way, weirdo.
Mine's not like that."

06:19.795 --> 06:25.437
Unless that's normal. 'Cause, yeah,
it's not to me, right? Up high!

06:26.836 --> 06:29.036
Wow!
The top of Mount Everest!

06:29.038 --> 06:30.158
I did it! Whew!

06:30.159 --> 06:33.741
I'm just gonna take a little
break, maybe ...

06:33.742 --> 06:36.945
The top of Mount Everest
just went up my butt!

06:37.646 --> 06:39.246
All right! Awesome!

06:39.248 --> 06:44.651
Patrons of medieval times,
your champion, the Blue Knight!

06:44.853 --> 06:49.223
Mom, look!
Blue Knight, you're my hero!

06:49.225 --> 06:54.094
Why, thank you, squire!
All hail the king!

06:54.096 --> 06:56.430
- All hail the king!
- Oh [bleep] me.

06:56.432 --> 06:59.233
- I locked my keys in my car.
- Hey, you have AAA?

06:59.235 --> 07:02.469
No, I don't have AAA!
Who the [bleep] do I look like,

07:02.471 --> 07:05.239
- Scrooge [bleep] McDuck?!
- Just trying to help.

07:05.241 --> 07:06.928
Oh, oh, oh, good. Good.
Well, let me help you.

07:07.008 --> 07:09.947
Why don't you go find a dick ...
yeah ... put it in between two

07:09.982 --> 07:11.985
pieces of bread, and then go
[bleep] eat it,

07:12.020 --> 07:14.276
you [bleep] retard?

07:14.450 --> 07:16.601
Hey, window, blow me.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.752
Ohhh! Ohh! Son of a bitch!

07:18.754 --> 07:22.089
Oh, mother of Christ!
I just broke my hand!

07:22.091 --> 07:26.260
I don't have health insurance,
and I broke my G.D. hand!

07:26.262 --> 07:28.929
Ahh! There! Ha!

07:28.931 --> 07:31.632
Can't get the [bleep] open!

07:31.634 --> 07:34.201
Ohh. Get off!

07:34.203 --> 07:37.504
Oh, I'm [bleep] wet.

07:37.506 --> 07:39.857
No gas?! Oh [bleep]

07:39.858 --> 07:44.010
Time to pay it forward, butt muffin.

07:44.021 --> 07:46.246
Oh, that's nasty!

07:46.248 --> 07:49.116
Oh, I just drank some gas!

07:49.118 --> 07:50.717
<i>Ew, gross!</i>

07:50.719 --> 07:52.619
Get over yourself, princess!

07:58.093 --> 08:00.427
All hail the king!

08:00.429 --> 08:04.398
Oh, shit.
I killed that dude. He's dead.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.334
Well, guess I'm a
Red Knight fan now, mom.

08:07.336 --> 08:09.603
- Yeah. Call me "daddy."
- No!

08:09.605 --> 08:10.618
I was talking to her.

08:10.924 --> 08:13.366
Will it be an early
spring or a late winter?

08:13.367 --> 08:15.809
Only Punxsutawney Phil
knows for sure.

08:17.813 --> 08:20.180
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
Get back!

08:20.182 --> 08:23.116
It's winter ... a winter
like you've never seen!

08:23.118 --> 08:26.753
Run, you fools!

08:29.558 --> 08:34.595
What's that, Beverly?
You want Wesley to watch?

08:34.597 --> 08:37.798
Make it so.

08:37.799 --> 08:41.707
2300 hours. Time for the
Night Crew to relieve us.

08:42.634 --> 08:44.004
Captain.

08:44.006 --> 08:45.940
CapitÃ¡n.

08:46.942 --> 08:49.810
- # Aw, yeah! #
- Night Crew may take course.

08:49.812 --> 08:52.747
<i>Space ... the final frontier!</i>

08:52.748 --> 08:55.682
<i>These are the 11:00 P.M.</i>

08:55.684 --> 08:57.818
<i>To 7:00 A.M. voyages of the
Enterprise's Night Crew.</i>

08:57.820 --> 09:02.823
<i>Its continuing mission is...
# to partay! #</i>

09:05.027 --> 09:06.881
<i>Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!</i>

09:06.882 --> 09:10.705
Captain Jake, a Borg
cube is hailing us.

09:10.740 --> 09:14.801
Maybe they want us to turn
down our jams. Fat chance!

09:14.803 --> 09:18.528
Lower your shields.
Your culture will adapt to service us.

09:18.563 --> 09:20.541
You want us to service you?

09:20.543 --> 09:23.464
Affirmative. You will
service the Borg ...

09:23.465 --> 09:25.312
all night if needed.

09:25.414 --> 09:28.715
Wait. Our hive mind has
assimilated double entendres.

09:28.717 --> 09:31.285
Real mature, guys.
Prepare for assimilation.

09:33.521 --> 09:35.389
Our shields won't last long, sir.

09:35.391 --> 09:37.766
Should we wake up the bald guy?

09:39.536 --> 09:41.291
No way, Commander LaFreak!

09:41.293 --> 09:44.027
We'll beat the Borg just like
we beat that frat on Gallos-7.

09:44.029 --> 09:46.096
We'll sell naked photos
of their girlfriends

09:46.098 --> 09:47.664
-  at a pie-eating contest?
- What? No!

09:47.666 --> 09:50.134
Like any frat, the Borg
share a hive mind, man.

09:50.136 --> 09:52.736
If we get one Borg to
party, all Borg will party!

09:52.738 --> 09:56.106
Night Crew, prepare to rock
out with our Spocks out!

09:56.108 --> 10:00.377
Did somebody order a partygram?

10:07.286 --> 10:11.622
Wet t-shirt contest!
Oh, right ... no shirt.

10:11.624 --> 10:14.558
You want mine?
Oh, chill out, dude!

10:14.560 --> 10:17.995
- Wait ... is she your daughter?
- Enough! Partying is futile!

10:17.997 --> 10:21.565
Your blood, so full of beer.

10:21.567 --> 10:26.203
Your party... so hearty!

10:26.205 --> 10:29.473
Whoo-hoo!

10:29.475 --> 10:32.476
Now, this I can assimilate!

10:35.079 --> 10:38.382
Captain Jake, Starfleet thanks
you for defeating the Borg.

10:38.384 --> 10:42.386
- Bitchin'!
- Night Cre-e-e-e-e-e-w!

10:42.387 --> 10:43.687
Beer me.

10:46.692 --> 10:49.693
You glorious sons of bitches!
