00:15.249 --> 00:17.082
- This is it, Catbrain!

00:17.985 --> 00:22.354
The time we've waited
for all our lives!

00:23.591 --> 00:25.424
Star Frisbee?

00:25.426 --> 00:28.494
I love Star Frisbee,
Professor McTinkerClaws.

00:28.496 --> 00:30.295
- No you don't!

00:30.297 --> 00:32.765
Cats don't play frisbee,
remember?

00:32.767 --> 00:33.832
And you're a cat!

00:33.968 --> 00:36.035
- Oh, right.

00:36.037 --> 00:41.140
- Cats are cool, casual, aloof,

00:41.142 --> 00:44.243
unaffected, understand?

00:44.245 --> 00:46.379
- Uh, yup.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.514
- Then why don't you start
acting like it?

00:48.516 --> 00:51.784
I paid 50 space bucks
to that baboon space

00:51.786 --> 00:56.088
scientist in Nebula 19 just
to brainwash you into thinking

00:56.090 --> 01:01.160
just to help you
remember your feline roots

01:02.129 --> 01:05.431
after that asteroid
chunk hit you on the head

01:05.433 --> 01:10.502
and gave you the crazy
idea that you were a dog.

01:11.138 --> 01:13.122
- Madness!

01:13.123 --> 01:15.107
I didn't know what I was thinking,
Professor McTinkerClaws.

01:15.109 --> 01:17.743
Thank you for helping
me see the light.

01:17.745 --> 01:21.647
- No worries, Catbrain,
no worries.

01:21.649 --> 01:24.616
Now, as I was saying,

01:25.519 --> 01:29.388
this the hour of
our finest victory,

01:29.390 --> 01:34.359
the moment we show dogs
everywhere what we're made of.

01:35.930 --> 01:39.064
With my new mega neutron
dimensional destructor,

01:41.035 --> 01:43.168
I'll finally wipe
out that wretched

01:43.170 --> 01:45.471
bone-verse once and for all.

01:47.241 --> 01:48.140
- Meow, meow, meow, yes!

01:49.443 --> 01:53.345
- And those goofy dogs will
realize that without dog snacks,

01:54.115 --> 01:56.281
there are no dogs.

01:57.485 --> 01:59.218
- Oh, I see.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.887
Take away the food, you take
away the dog.

02:01.889 --> 02:05.357
- Let us focus on the task at
hand.

02:05.359 --> 02:08.193
Pushing the bone-verse into
extinction,

02:08.195 --> 02:13.265
wiping out all the bone marrow
power, until nothing is left.

02:17.420 --> 02:20.204
Then and only then, space
will belong to the cats, ah!

02:34.688 --> 02:38.190
- Thanks for returning to headquarters so promptly,
you two.

02:38.192 --> 02:40.159
- That's our job, Captain Fuzz
Face.

02:40.161 --> 02:42.861
- Yup, your wish is our command.

02:43.898 --> 02:47.332
Uh, your command is our command,

02:48.736 --> 02:51.503
we do what you say
when you say it.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.305
Point taken, Space Lobber.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.339
You can chill out.

02:54.341 --> 02:59.878
- It's just that uh, sometimes
I'm not clear, Sky Fetcher.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.748
I've been trying to
be more precise.

03:02.750 --> 03:05.517
- I understand what you're
saying, Space Lobber,

03:05.519 --> 03:09.154
and I thank you for your
dedication and vigilance.

03:09.156 --> 03:09.988
- Yeah?

03:09.990 --> 03:10.989
Uh, sweet!

03:10.991 --> 03:12.357
- How can we help you, Captain?

03:12.359 --> 03:14.226
Is the kitchen
blender jammed again?

03:14.228 --> 03:15.761
- Tuna will do that.

03:15.763 --> 03:18.297
We can
clear it out, though.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.732
And get it working
again in no time.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.334
- Sure can, we'll head back now

03:22.336 --> 03:23.535
and check it out if you like.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.537
I can lap up the tuna particles.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.339
- Yeah!
- No, boys.

03:27.341 --> 03:30.475
I'm afraid it's not the
blender that's the problem.

03:30.477 --> 03:32.544
- Oh no!

03:32.546 --> 03:34.580
Is the oven on the fritz again?

03:34.582 --> 03:36.181
That's a bummer!

03:36.183 --> 03:38.417
Roast turkey jammed again?

03:38.419 --> 03:40.485
- We can get on
that right away, Captain.

03:40.487 --> 03:43.155
- No, it's not the oven either.

03:43.157 --> 03:43.989
- Is it the plumbing?

03:43.991 --> 03:45.557
'Cause if it's the plumbing,

03:45.559 --> 03:47.993
we can't help
you there, Captain.

03:47.995 --> 03:52.297
- Nope, I'd say just use
the top deck AstroTurf yard

03:52.299 --> 03:57.302
and don't forget to have all
the dogs curb themselves.

03:57.304 --> 03:59.238
- Thanks for the tip, boys.

03:59.240 --> 04:03.308
But our issue is far more
serious than even that.

04:03.310 --> 04:06.778
It seems the source of our
universe-wide dog treats

04:06.780 --> 04:09.915
is disappearing at
an alarming rate.

04:09.917 --> 04:10.949
- Oh no!

04:10.951 --> 04:12.084
You mean?

04:12.086 --> 04:15.754
- The bone-iverse is
losing its marrow power.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.122
- No! How?

04:18.225 --> 04:19.491
- We're not sure.

04:19.493 --> 04:24.029
By scientific calculations,
just over 17 million tons

04:24.031 --> 04:26.965
of galactic bone marrow
power has disappeared

04:26.967 --> 04:29.301
in less than one light year!

04:29.303 --> 04:31.136
- 17 tons?

04:31.138 --> 04:34.239
- At that rate, the
bone-iverse will be completely

04:34.241 --> 04:37.776
barren in slightly less
than another light year!

04:37.778 --> 04:39.611
- Less than a light year?

04:39.613 --> 04:41.880
Oh, but that means
outer space will be out

04:41.882 --> 04:43.849
of dog treats in our lifetime.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.617
- What will we snack on?

04:45.619 --> 04:49.121
- There will be lots of
spaceships with chewed up holes.

04:49.123 --> 04:52.324
- Unless we get to the bottom of
things.

04:52.326 --> 04:56.595
Identify whoever's responsible
and stop 'em in their tracks.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.263
- Sounds like a job for--

04:58.265 --> 05:00.432
- The Avenger Dogs!

05:00.434 --> 05:03.035
- Oh yeah, you mean
you guys, right?

05:03.037 --> 05:06.605
- I mean all of us,
the Avenger Dogs,

05:06.607 --> 05:09.541
as you two are part of the team.

05:09.543 --> 05:10.542
- Us?

05:10.544 --> 05:12.311
- You can't possibly mean us.

05:12.313 --> 05:14.179
We've been kicking back
on Planet Kickback

05:14.181 --> 05:15.814
at the Paws Up Doggy Spa.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.582
Have you ever been,
Captain Fuzz Face?

05:17.584 --> 05:21.186
- No, I--
- Oh, it's pure heaven.

05:21.188 --> 05:22.087
You gotta go!

05:22.089 --> 05:23.522
You should come back with us,

05:23.524 --> 05:26.658
as we're on our way back
after chatting with ya.

05:26.660 --> 05:31.229
- Maybe we will, boys, after
we save the bone-iverse.

05:31.231 --> 05:32.531
- We?

05:32.533 --> 05:33.665
You said we.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.000
You mean you, right?

05:35.002 --> 05:38.036
- No, Sky Fetcher, I mean we.

05:38.038 --> 05:42.974
I'm re-deputizing you two
effective immediately.

05:42.976 --> 05:43.809
- Us?

05:43.811 --> 05:45.577
But we're way out of practice.

05:45.579 --> 05:48.380
- And way out of shape.

05:48.382 --> 05:52.050
- We have issues,
hangups, dog anxiety.

05:52.052 --> 05:55.554
- Yeah, chew stick
traumatic stress is real.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.788
- Listen up, boys.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.758
You two are my best officers.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.059
- That's 'cause all other space

06:01.061 --> 06:02.894
officers are away on missions.

06:02.896 --> 06:07.833
- Uh, yeah, but you never failed
our dog world on a mission.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.768
- There's a first time for
everything.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.703
- That's right.

06:11.704 --> 06:13.637
Listen Captain, we're still
on the clock at the spa.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.741
We just stepped away for a
minute to see what was up,

06:15.743 --> 06:17.776
but now that we know, we--

06:17.778 --> 06:21.079
- We gotta be getting
back right away.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.048
- Stat!
- I'm sorry, boys.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.750
But it's already done.

06:24.752 --> 06:29.287
Your ship is tuned up,
fueled up and ready to fly.

06:29.289 --> 06:31.156
We're all counting on you.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.062
Dog speed, Avengers!

06:37.064 --> 06:39.765
I know you'll do us proud.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.633
- Dog-gone darn.

06:45.139 --> 06:48.140
- Wow, I can't believe we're
back in action, Sky Fetcher.

06:48.142 --> 06:50.275
- You and me both, Space Lobber.

06:50.277 --> 06:51.476
Where do we even begin?

06:51.478 --> 06:53.912
It's been so long since
I sat at these controls.

06:53.914 --> 06:57.182
- Well to be fair, it
hasn't been that long.

06:57.184 --> 07:00.786
It's only
been an earth year.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.254
- Which is like 15 dog years,

07:02.256 --> 07:05.657
and 10,000
anti-matter light years.

07:05.659 --> 07:06.758
Oh, yes.

07:10.063 --> 07:13.465
Since you put it that
way, time flies like a--

07:13.467 --> 07:16.601
- Don't say that word.
- What word?

07:16.603 --> 07:17.903
- The F word.

07:17.905 --> 07:21.406
- You mean F?
- Yes, frisbee.

07:21.408 --> 07:23.708
I still have a real issue
around round objects.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.010
Ever since that frisbee accident

07:25.012 --> 07:26.745
in the circular saw nebula.

07:26.747 --> 07:31.049
- And everything is round
in space, Sky Fetcher.

07:31.051 --> 07:34.069
- Tell me about it.

07:34.070 --> 07:37.088
Stars, planets, black holes,
meteors, round, round, round.

07:37.424 --> 07:38.924
Yikes!

07:38.926 --> 07:40.725
- What about me, Sky?

07:40.727 --> 07:43.695
I still haven't gotten over
the loss of my thunder shirt

07:43.697 --> 07:45.330
on our last mission.

07:45.332 --> 07:47.499
Talk about separation anxiety.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.234
Sometimes I wake up howling.

07:52.306 --> 07:53.338
- I know.

07:53.340 --> 07:55.440
Let's just navigate
back to the Paws Up Spa

07:55.442 --> 07:58.310
and tell Captain Fuzz
Face we couldn't do it.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.496
- Really?

08:00.497 --> 08:02.681
But we'd be letting the
entire dog universe down.

08:02.683 --> 08:07.552
We'd fail them completely,
right when they needed us most.

08:07.554 --> 08:09.254
- You have a point.

08:09.256 --> 08:10.856
But do you remember
what that steam

08:10.858 --> 08:12.757
bath felt like on our coats?

08:14.027 --> 08:18.630
Oh, heavenly.

08:18.632 --> 08:19.798
Let's go back.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.501
We'll send the Captain
a day pass to join us

08:22.503 --> 08:24.035
and a vegan cookbook.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.403
He'll understand.

08:25.405 --> 08:28.773
Bone meal treats
are overrated anyway.

08:28.775 --> 08:31.643
Yeah, he'll understand.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.778
Oh darn it, we can't.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.548
We've got to forge ahead,
we've got to follow orders.

08:36.549 --> 08:38.683
We are dogs after all.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.652
To follow orders is our mission.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.153
- It is?

08:42.155 --> 08:44.456
But what about the steam bath?

08:44.458 --> 08:46.391
What about that
carrot cake snacks?

08:46.393 --> 08:48.159
- I know, I know.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.462
If we can solve the mystery
of who's behind this assault

08:50.464 --> 08:51.630
on the bone-verse fast enough,

08:51.632 --> 08:54.099
we can get back to the spa
and finish our session.

08:54.101 --> 08:57.002
If we apply ourselves,
we can do it.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.703
You heard what
Captain Fuzz Face said,

08:58.705 --> 09:01.506
we're his best officers.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.575
At least, the best
available ones.

09:05.012 --> 09:07.412
- We've Avenger Dogs!
- That's right.

09:07.414 --> 09:09.347
And Avenger Dogs never quit,

09:09.349 --> 09:12.417
we never rollover,
we never play dead.

09:12.419 --> 09:13.251
- Nope.

09:13.253 --> 09:16.221
So,
where do we start?

09:16.223 --> 09:18.590
- Hmm, that's a good question.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.258
It's been so long
since we upheld

09:20.260 --> 09:21.927
law and order in the galaxy.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.931
I know, let's contact our
old informant, Tuff Nut.

09:25.933 --> 09:29.301
He knows everything that's
going on in the underground.

09:29.303 --> 09:31.954
- Tuff Nut?

09:31.955 --> 09:34.606
I heard he got into a dog
fight in the Rabieson galaxy

09:34.608 --> 09:37.242
and it didn't work
out too well for him.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.910
You think he's still around?

09:38.912 --> 09:40.478
- There's only one
way to find out.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.713
I still have his old number,

09:41.715 --> 09:43.648
let's punch it in
and see if it works!

09:43.650 --> 09:45.684
Tuff Nut!

09:45.686 --> 09:47.719
- Oh no, what is it now?

09:47.721 --> 09:49.721
I thought you two retired.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.856
- We did, sorta.

09:51.858 --> 09:55.460
- But we're back.
- And better than ever.

09:55.462 --> 09:56.861
- We are?

09:56.863 --> 09:58.730
- Just go with it, Space Lobber.

09:58.732 --> 10:01.933
- We're back and
better than ever.

10:01.935 --> 10:02.801
- Great.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.369
To what do I owe the pleasure?

10:04.371 --> 10:07.205
- The bone-verse is in
great danger, Tuff Nut.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.140
- And we're gonna save her.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.141
- Oh yeah?

10:10.143 --> 10:11.910
And just how do a
couple of old mutts

10:11.912 --> 10:13.845
like you two plan on doing that?

10:13.847 --> 10:14.913
- Wait a second!

10:14.915 --> 10:17.415
So you know
something about this?

10:17.417 --> 10:20.018
- We knew you'd have
inside info, Tuff Nut.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.087
What's going on?

10:22.089 --> 10:24.155
Who's responsible?

10:24.157 --> 10:25.624
- Oh, it's bad, guys.

10:25.626 --> 10:27.325
Real bad.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.928
The bone-verse's source
bones were pilfered

10:29.930 --> 10:32.430
by a sworn enemy of dog-dom

10:32.432 --> 10:34.599
and things are gonna
get a whole lot worse

10:34.601 --> 10:36.768
before they get better, you dig?

10:36.770 --> 10:39.504
- Only when I'm
looking for a bone.

10:39.506 --> 10:40.338
What?

10:40.340 --> 10:41.773
Uh, nevermind.

10:41.775 --> 10:44.576
Tuff Nut, can you tell us
who this sworn enemy is?

10:44.578 --> 10:45.744
Who are we looking for?

10:45.746 --> 10:47.012
Do we know them?

10:47.014 --> 10:50.815
- Oh yeah, you know this
cat well, real well.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.283
But he's got my tongue.

10:52.285 --> 10:54.052
If I tell you any
more than that,

10:54.054 --> 10:55.987
I'm gonna be in real trouble.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.422
Everybody knows you dogs don't

10:57.424 --> 10:59.691
have my back anymore,
you feel me?

10:59.693 --> 11:01.993
I gotta look out for
number one these days.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.996
- Come join us,
we'll protect you.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.799
And what about
when your mission's over?

11:07.801 --> 11:09.501
Are you gonna drop me
off in some star

11:09.503 --> 11:12.270
system with no fire
hydrants like last time?

11:12.272 --> 11:13.672
To fend for myself?

11:13.674 --> 11:15.640
Well.

11:15.642 --> 11:18.943
- You know how tough life gets
for a dog without hydrants?

11:18.945 --> 11:22.547
Not to mention the elements
that hangs out in those planets,

11:22.549 --> 11:25.083
mostly inch worms
with a bad attitude.

11:25.085 --> 11:28.153
- Oh yeah, sounds pretty tough.

11:28.155 --> 11:31.156
- All of 'em with eyes
and ears to the ground.

11:31.158 --> 11:33.158
All of them ready to rat me out.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.460
- Inch worms have eyes and ears?

11:35.462 --> 11:37.829
- He means metaphorically, Slob.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.864
- Yeah, you try it, folks.

11:39.866 --> 11:42.000
It ain't fun.

11:42.001 --> 11:44.135
You dogs could've at least
put me in witness protection,

11:44.137 --> 11:46.771
given me a new canine
identity, but no.

11:47.774 --> 11:50.675
Well no more, Tuff Nut's
not your Huckleberry.

11:50.677 --> 11:52.110
- Tuff Nut, please.

11:52.112 --> 11:55.046
The survival of every dog
in outer space is at stake.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.648
- That means you too, buddy.

11:56.650 --> 11:58.149
- Me too?

11:58.151 --> 12:00.585
I don't think so.

12:00.587 --> 12:04.389
I won a sweepstakes and can
eat free for life at McComets.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.390
- Free for life?

12:05.392 --> 12:06.291
Wow!

12:07.227 --> 12:09.027
- But, McComets?

12:09.029 --> 12:09.994
Is that good for you?

12:09.996 --> 12:11.463
- Free is good enough.

12:11.465 --> 12:15.366
I don't gotta rely on the bone-verse or any dog ever again.

12:15.368 --> 12:18.503
I'm in business for me,
just the way I like it.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.939
- Oh, I see.
- You better.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.674
And I'd act fast, y'all,

12:22.676 --> 12:25.977
else you might lose a lot
more than those tasty treats.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.545
Peace out.

12:27.547 --> 12:30.215
- Oh, that doesn't sound good.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.549
- No, it doesn't.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.818
Come on, if Tuff Nut
won't help us,

12:33.820 --> 12:35.787
we gotta find who's
responsible for this,

12:35.789 --> 12:39.257
this thievery before
they find us first!

12:40.193 --> 12:41.960
- Well, well, well,

12:41.962 --> 12:45.497
if it isn't my old
nemesis, Captain Fuzz Face.

12:46.399 --> 12:49.634
You're ugly as ever, I see.

12:49.636 --> 12:52.704
- I could say the same
for you, McTinkerClaws.

12:53.807 --> 12:58.376
To what do I owe this
call, you maniacal meower?

12:58.378 --> 13:02.747
- I wanted to save you from
all the time and the trouble

13:02.749 --> 13:06.885
of organizing your forces
to come and look for me.

13:06.887 --> 13:07.886
- Oh?

13:07.888 --> 13:10.622
And why would we
be looking for you?

13:10.624 --> 13:15.426
It's been a joy to have you
out of sight and out of mind.

13:15.428 --> 13:19.964
- You'd be looking for me
because I'm the one responsible

13:19.966 --> 13:24.602
for the crisis in your precious
bone-verse, that's why.

13:25.772 --> 13:27.238
- You?

13:27.240 --> 13:30.074
I should've known!
- Ah, ha!

13:30.076 --> 13:32.210
But you didn't, did you?

13:32.212 --> 13:37.282
Just like a dog, so
trusting and oblivious.

13:37.484 --> 13:42.120
You have no
clue as to the true

13:42.122 --> 13:45.657
devious nature of cats.

13:45.659 --> 13:48.326
- Well, dogs are good-hearted
creatures.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.561
What can we do?

13:49.563 --> 13:53.731
- Good-hearted extinct
creatures, Captain.

13:53.733 --> 13:56.734
History is littered with
the bones of kind animals

13:56.736 --> 13:59.204
who weren't tough
enough to cut it.

13:59.206 --> 14:03.274
Now you
will soon join them.

14:05.679 --> 14:08.479
- You won't succeed,
McTinkerClaws.

14:08.481 --> 14:11.816
Just like you haven't
succeeded in any of your other

14:11.818 --> 14:15.019
threats to our universe's
safety and wellbeing.

14:15.021 --> 14:18.623
Puppy love is stronger
than feline hate.

14:18.625 --> 14:22.894
- Sound bites and slogans
won't save you, Captain.

14:22.896 --> 14:26.497
It's the end of the
line for you dogs

14:26.499 --> 14:29.234
and for all the snacks
you love to eat.

14:29.236 --> 14:32.470
For ages I've been
looking forward

14:32.472 --> 14:34.806
to a universe built on catnip.

14:35.809 --> 14:40.078
And at last,
the dawn of a grand

14:40.080 --> 14:43.081
new era is upon us.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.983
- Bring it on, feline.

14:44.985 --> 14:47.986
Just as your villainy
knows no bounds,

14:47.988 --> 14:50.488
neither does our righteousness.

14:50.490 --> 14:53.057
We'll turn all your
efforts back,

14:53.059 --> 14:56.160
just like we've turned
them back before.

14:56.162 --> 14:59.197
- Sounds fun, game on.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.834
See you soon, lap dog.

15:02.836 --> 15:05.169
You can count on it.

15:05.171 --> 15:06.971
- Game on, cat!

15:07.841 --> 15:09.874
Birdbutt, we need to talk.

15:10.677 --> 15:13.745
- Oh, is it about the
chair legs in the lounge?

15:13.747 --> 15:15.713
I'll have you know
I was not the one

15:15.715 --> 15:17.448
who chewed them up, Captain.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.683
- The chair legs?

15:18.685 --> 15:19.684
What?

15:19.686 --> 15:22.720
No, it's not about
the chair legs.

15:22.722 --> 15:23.888
- Ah, phew.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.957
- Are the chair legs damaged?

15:25.959 --> 15:27.725
- Well, the good thing is,

15:27.727 --> 15:29.794
dogs don't mind
eating on the floor.

15:29.796 --> 15:32.597
So chairs with
no legs are alright.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.600
- I see, I'll call
maintenance then.

15:35.602 --> 15:38.436
- What did you need to
see me about, Captain?

15:38.438 --> 15:42.006
- McTinkerClaws is back and
he's robbing the bone-iverse

15:42.008 --> 15:43.975
of all its marrow power!

15:43.977 --> 15:46.411
- He's stealing the
marrow power?

15:46.413 --> 15:49.447
But that means--
- I'm afraid so.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.784
No more dog treats, ever!

15:53.887 --> 15:56.287
- This puts our
very lives at risk.

15:56.289 --> 15:59.123
We won't be able to sustain
ourselves in outer space

15:59.125 --> 16:02.727
without the nutrient rich dog
treats from the bone-verse.

16:02.729 --> 16:05.964
Leg chairs are a great
in between meals treat,

16:05.966 --> 16:08.366
but they're not a meal in
themselves.

16:08.368 --> 16:12.804
- Right, that's why I've dispatched my former best officers,

16:12.806 --> 16:17.775
Sky Fetcher and Space Lobber,
to stop this despicable plot

16:17.777 --> 16:20.278
before it goes too far!

16:20.280 --> 16:22.480
- Oh good, can I go now?

16:22.482 --> 16:26.050
I heard there's a couple of
unchewed chairs in Area 41.

16:26.052 --> 16:28.886
- No, you can't go, Birdbutt.

16:28.888 --> 16:30.321
We have a problem.

16:30.323 --> 16:33.224
I fear that Sky Fetcher
and Space Lobber

16:33.226 --> 16:35.193
are not up to the
task this time.

16:36.029 --> 16:37.495
- Ah, drag.

16:37.497 --> 16:40.298
- Yes, it's a drag indeed.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.667
It's a super drag.

16:43.503 --> 16:47.171
- If I may ask, Captain,
what is their problem?

16:47.173 --> 16:49.207
Is it digestion issues again?

16:49.209 --> 16:52.276
- No, no, nothing like that.

16:52.278 --> 16:53.978
It's all mental.

16:53.980 --> 16:55.947
Their heads are in the stars.

16:55.949 --> 16:58.216
Sky and Space are out of shape

16:58.218 --> 17:02.320
and racked with hangups,
insecurities and phobias.

17:02.322 --> 17:03.621
- Perhaps they should return

17:03.623 --> 17:06.491
to the dojo for intensive
retraining.

17:06.492 --> 17:08.526
- Yes, perhaps.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.894
You think you can whip those

17:09.896 --> 17:11.963
dogs into fighting
shape, Birdbutt?

17:12.732 --> 17:14.999
- Leave it to Birdbutt, Captain.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.707
- I'm having flashbacks, Space
Lobber.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.242
All the round planets
are making me nervous.

17:25.244 --> 17:28.746
All I can think about
is frisbees.

17:28.748 --> 17:32.016
- At least you came
out of it in one piece.

17:32.018 --> 17:35.153
Only a small bump on the noggin.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.422
I never did find my
thundershirt.

17:37.424 --> 17:40.958
Every time I spot a meteor
shower, or an asteroid field,

17:40.960 --> 17:43.995
I get the cold sweats.

17:43.997 --> 17:45.063
- Ain't we a pair?

17:45.065 --> 17:46.798
How in the universe
are we ever gonna get

17:46.800 --> 17:48.866
to the bottom of this
assault on the bone-verse?

17:48.868 --> 17:50.568
We can't even think straight.

17:50.570 --> 17:51.436
Sky Fetcher!

17:51.438 --> 17:52.670
Space Lobber!

17:52.672 --> 17:54.338
I have some bad news.

17:54.340 --> 17:57.008
- Worse than what
we've already heard?

17:57.010 --> 17:58.643
- I'm afraid so.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.711
McTinkerClaws is back.

18:00.713 --> 18:02.447
McTinkerClaws?

18:02.449 --> 18:04.715
- Yes, McTinkerClaws!

18:04.717 --> 18:06.984
And he's the perpetrator
of the assault

18:06.986 --> 18:08.219
on the bone-iverse.

18:08.221 --> 18:09.821
- We should've known.

18:09.823 --> 18:12.156
- Yes, you probably should have.

18:12.158 --> 18:15.026
- You agreed kinda
fast there, Captain.

18:15.028 --> 18:16.928
- I need you two dogs to report

18:16.930 --> 18:19.931
to the planet Chewy
dojo at once!

18:19.933 --> 18:21.599
- Planet Chewy?

18:21.601 --> 18:25.937
Oh, but we completed our
Avenger Dog training eons ago.

18:25.939 --> 18:30.608
- Yeah, we're pros, seasoned
pups, the best of the best.

18:32.412 --> 18:33.778
Was that a frisbee?

18:33.780 --> 18:35.746
Did I just see a frisbee?

18:35.748 --> 18:37.882
- Don't quibble with me, boys.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.050
Just do it!

18:39.052 --> 18:42.186
Sensei Birdbutt is
awaiting your arrival.

18:42.188 --> 18:44.155
- Sensei Birdbutt?

18:44.157 --> 18:46.324
Oh, but his
training is too tough.

18:46.326 --> 18:49.560
We just barely got
enough spa time for this.

18:49.562 --> 18:53.431
- Avenger Dogs must be
in top shape at all time.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.833
Now it's time to
sharpen your instincts

18:55.835 --> 18:57.735
and hone your skills.

18:57.737 --> 18:58.569
- But Captain, we--

18:58.571 --> 19:00.271
- That's an order, Sky Fetcher.

19:00.273 --> 19:01.839
- Sir.
- Yes, sir.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.407
We're not gonna be
able to bark and howl

19:03.409 --> 19:05.409
our way through this one,
Space Lobber.

19:05.411 --> 19:09.046
- No, Sensei Birdbutt it is.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.928
Space Lobber, Sky Fetcher,

19:23.930 --> 19:26.030
welcome back to planet Chewy.

19:26.032 --> 19:29.400
I trust your journey into our
atmosphere was comfortable.

19:30.303 --> 19:33.237
- It could've been a
little smoother, Sensei.

19:33.239 --> 19:36.440
- Nothing worth having
comes easy, officer.

19:36.442 --> 19:38.709
We must work hard, then harder.

19:38.711 --> 19:41.946
For ever victory we earn,
big or small,

19:41.948 --> 19:44.482
there are no shortcuts
in the universe.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.951
- Actually, I know a couple.

19:46.953 --> 19:49.954
- That's right, the black
hole in Nebula Seven

19:49.956 --> 19:52.356
leads directly into
the fourth dimension

19:52.358 --> 19:56.427
and at the Paws Up Doggy Spa.

19:56.429 --> 19:58.829
- That is not necessarily what

19:58.831 --> 20:01.232
I was speaking of, Space Lobber.

20:01.234 --> 20:05.102
- Oh, well if you ever
need to get to the fourth

20:05.104 --> 20:10.107
dimension and a really great
spa real quick, there you go.

20:10.109 --> 20:12.310
- Tell me, Sky Fetcher.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.511
- Uh oh.

20:13.513 --> 20:16.547
- Do you still harbor
anxiety at the sight

20:16.549 --> 20:19.984
of circular objects
like frisbees?

20:19.986 --> 20:23.387
Uh,
no, not really.

20:23.389 --> 20:26.190
I mean, I'm okay
flying through the galaxy

20:26.192 --> 20:27.925
if that's what you mean.

20:29.095 --> 20:31.495
I can't take it, I have
flashbacks every time

20:31.497 --> 20:34.799
I see a planet, Sensei,
and planets are everywhere.

20:34.801 --> 20:37.835
I can't even look at the
buttons on our dashboard

20:37.837 --> 20:39.437
without breaking into a sweat.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.472
They're round!

20:42.976 --> 20:45.243
- So much for keeping our cool.

20:45.245 --> 20:46.677
- I see.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.746
What about you, Space Lobber?

20:48.748 --> 20:50.414
Have you ever overcome the loss

20:50.416 --> 20:53.217
of your beloved thundershirt?

20:53.219 --> 20:55.419
A long time ago.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.955
Who needs a thundershirt
when we have

20:57.957 --> 21:00.458
solid partners like you guys?

21:04.030 --> 21:04.929
I do!

21:06.966 --> 21:08.566
I miss it so much, Sensei!

21:09.469 --> 21:10.868
I'm cold all the time!

21:13.506 --> 21:15.373
I shake uncontrollably.

21:16.709 --> 21:20.211
I miss the way it held me
tight

21:20.213 --> 21:23.247
through asteroid showers
and flash storms.

21:25.285 --> 21:27.151
I felt so secure.

21:30.456 --> 21:32.023
I felt invincible.

21:32.992 --> 21:35.493
Now I just feel,

21:35.495 --> 21:39.096
I just feel like a naked dog.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.736
- Now we're getting somewhere.

21:45.738 --> 21:49.640
You boys are suffering what
is known as a dog block.

21:49.642 --> 21:52.843
- Well all I know is we
didn't suffer any dog blocks

21:52.845 --> 21:55.413
back at the Paws Up Doggy Spa.

21:55.415 --> 22:00.484
- Uh, nope, everything was
just fine at the spa, Sensei.

22:01.487 --> 22:04.021
- That comfort zone is
a beautiful place, boys,

22:04.023 --> 22:06.257
but nothing ever grows there.

22:06.259 --> 22:11.329
- Yeah, is that like a
motivational thing or what is?

22:11.531 --> 22:13.631
- Yup, he's trying to
get in our heads.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.366
You know he does.

22:15.368 --> 22:18.135
- Right, right, right, right.

22:18.137 --> 22:21.505
- To rebuild confidence,
one must first break down

22:21.507 --> 22:24.175
the faulty supports
that have been built.

22:24.177 --> 22:29.246
Uh, so, we're
gonna do construction?

22:30.783 --> 22:33.250
- I'm uh, lousy at manual labor.

22:33.252 --> 22:34.819
I'll
just throw that out there.

22:34.821 --> 22:37.254
- Not as lousy as me, Sky.

22:37.256 --> 22:40.758
- We are going to access the
recesses of your pooch minds

22:40.760 --> 22:43.627
to strengthen your pup seikis

22:43.629 --> 22:46.564
and bolster your canine mental
defenses.

22:46.566 --> 22:51.569
- That sounds like hacking,
and hacking's illegal.

22:51.571 --> 22:52.837
Even in space.

22:54.240 --> 22:56.107
- I'd like to leave the recesses

22:56.109 --> 22:58.342
of my pooch mind alone, thanks.

22:59.312 --> 23:03.180
- Close your eyes, officers,
and repeat after me.

23:03.182 --> 23:05.950
I am the master of
my own destiny.

23:05.952 --> 23:09.019
The keeper of my own bone.

23:09.021 --> 23:12.423
- That's kinda weird.
- Totally weird.

23:12.425 --> 23:15.326
- Can we just uh, listen
to some jams or something?

23:15.328 --> 23:20.398
- Yeah, maybe practice
some yoga poses.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.367
- My down dog is strong.

23:23.369 --> 23:28.439
Oh, wait till
you see my happy puppy.

23:29.575 --> 23:32.643
- Focus, boys, focus!

23:35.314 --> 23:37.448
- Look at that, Catbrain,
the elusive,

23:37.450 --> 23:40.384
mystical, magical bone-verse.

23:41.988 --> 23:44.422
A few creatures who don't
count themselves among

23:44.424 --> 23:48.893
the canines have ever seen this
dimension.

23:48.895 --> 23:51.862
- I've never seen this
dimension, Mr. McTinkerClaws.

23:51.864 --> 23:55.399
And I'm a, no wait, I'm a cat.

23:55.401 --> 23:57.034
- That's right, Catbrain.

23:57.036 --> 23:59.837
You're a cat.

23:59.839 --> 24:04.074
Now repeat after me, meow.

24:04.076 --> 24:07.244
- Meow.
- Very good.

24:07.246 --> 24:10.347
Now then, activate
our new laser,

24:10.349 --> 24:12.616
the submolecular bone breaker,

24:12.618 --> 24:15.352
and let's crush these bones down

24:15.354 --> 24:18.756
to fine powder and
collect their dust.

24:18.758 --> 24:21.158
Once I run the fine powder
through

24:21.160 --> 24:23.227
my bone conversion transformer,

24:24.397 --> 24:26.297
it will emerge as the finest

24:26.299 --> 24:29.834
substance known to the universe.

24:31.103 --> 24:32.837
- You mean marrow meal?

24:32.839 --> 24:35.706
- No, you twit, catnip.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.608
It'll be catnip!

24:37.610 --> 24:41.512
And the universal balance of
power will shift forevermore.

24:42.982 --> 24:46.350
Never again will smelly
dogs lay claim

24:46.352 --> 24:48.586
to that silly man's best friend
moniker.

24:48.588 --> 24:51.822
Cats will become the
unchallenged number

24:51.824 --> 24:56.727
one domestic animal
in all existence.

24:56.729 --> 25:01.732
And I will be recognized as
the greatest cat of all time.

25:04.570 --> 25:06.537
- What about me, McTinkerClaws?

25:06.539 --> 25:08.539
Will I be known as a great cat?

25:08.541 --> 25:11.342
Will I be famous?
- You?

25:11.344 --> 25:12.243
Oh, you!

25:13.179 --> 25:15.246
Oh, you'll be known as a
footnote

25:15.248 --> 25:19.083
in my glorious legacy, Catbrain.

25:19.085 --> 25:20.184
- Oh, is that good?

25:20.186 --> 25:25.089
- Sure, it's perfect for the
likes of you.

25:25.091 --> 25:29.093
On the bright side, your
delusional brain will surely

25:29.095 --> 25:32.763
be studied by medical students
for light years to come.

25:33.666 --> 25:35.966
- Oh cool, I mean, meow.

25:36.769 --> 25:40.571
- Now, well let's cut
out the meowing

25:40.573 --> 25:42.473
and get down to business.

25:42.475 --> 25:46.577
I want every one of these
bones we see crushed,

25:46.579 --> 25:50.814
collected and converted
immediately.

25:50.816 --> 25:52.850
Yes sir,
Professor McTinkerClaws.

25:52.852 --> 25:54.184
Right away, sir.

26:02.795 --> 26:05.563
- How are the Avenger Dogs
progressing, Birdbutt?

26:05.565 --> 26:08.098
Any breakthroughs in their
psychosis?

26:08.100 --> 26:09.567
- Not at all, Captain.

26:09.569 --> 26:12.102
They're fearing far
worse than I'd hoped.

26:12.104 --> 26:14.572
They both harbor deep
seeded insecurities

26:14.574 --> 26:17.808
about their past traumatic
puppy experiences

26:17.810 --> 26:20.811
that will undoubtedly hamper
their ability to think

26:20.813 --> 26:24.048
and behave rationally
in the field.

26:24.050 --> 26:26.350
I'd say our chances of
saving the bone-verse

26:26.352 --> 26:28.419
with those two are slim to none.

26:28.421 --> 26:31.355
- Can we skew towards slim?

26:31.357 --> 26:34.858
I prefer not to speak in
absolutes in times of combat.

26:34.860 --> 26:37.261
- Ah, alright.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.997
Our chances of saving the
bone-verse with Sky Fetcher

26:39.999 --> 26:45.069
and Space Lobber is very, very,
very, extraordinarily slim.

26:46.839 --> 26:49.406
I mean, slim with a
capital S, L, I, and M.

26:51.277 --> 26:54.078
- Great so we have a shot then.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.814
- If that's how you care to
look at it, fine Captain.

26:56.816 --> 27:00.217
- I do and unfortunately,

27:00.219 --> 27:03.954
this leaves us with only
one course of action.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.789
- You mean we're going to call

27:05.791 --> 27:08.659
in the sage legend,
Ram Dalmatian?

27:08.661 --> 27:11.228
- No, Birdbutt,
we're going to toughen

27:11.230 --> 27:13.497
Sky Fetcher and Space Lobber up.

27:13.499 --> 27:18.268
We're going to rekindle their
fire, sharpen their claws,

27:18.270 --> 27:23.007
harden their fangs,
get me Butterball!

27:23.009 --> 27:24.174
- Butterball?

27:24.176 --> 27:28.545
But he's a wild card,
unpredictable, uncontrollable.

27:28.547 --> 27:30.814
We're not even sure what
side of the moon that

27:30.816 --> 27:34.418
lunatic's on from one moment to
the next.

27:34.420 --> 27:38.756
- Exactly, Sensei,
and he's our only hope.

27:38.758 --> 27:41.258
We're going to
reteach these dogs

27:41.260 --> 27:44.828
how to fight and fight to win.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.636
- This is hopeless, Sky.

27:52.638 --> 27:55.105
We aren't in the right
frame of mind to be working.

27:55.107 --> 27:58.275
I couldn't focus
on a single thing

27:58.277 --> 28:00.210
Sensei Birdbutt was saying.

28:00.212 --> 28:01.812
This is a disaster.

28:01.814 --> 28:04.014
What are we gonna do?

28:04.016 --> 28:06.383
- We need to pull ourselves
together, Space Lobber.

28:06.385 --> 28:07.451
We need to toughen up.

28:07.453 --> 28:10.754
- You think McTinkerClaws
will just roll over

28:10.756 --> 28:12.022
and let us stop him?

28:12.024 --> 28:13.957
- If we're ferocious
enough, sure.

28:13.959 --> 28:15.793
Lots of real loud barking
will make him think

28:15.795 --> 28:17.761
twice about crossing
us space dogs.

28:18.631 --> 28:21.832
- What if cosmic
animal control spots us

28:21.834 --> 28:24.034
and mistakes us for being rabid?

28:24.036 --> 28:26.370
- We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

28:26.372 --> 28:28.105
- Sounds like a plan.

28:28.107 --> 28:30.374
Can we work the bridge
while we're at it, Sky?

28:30.376 --> 28:32.443
- Sky Fetcher, Space Lobber.

28:32.445 --> 28:34.078
- That's us, Chief.

28:34.080 --> 28:37.281
- Highly trained and
ready for anything.

28:37.283 --> 28:38.115
Always.

28:38.117 --> 28:40.918
- No matter what
else you've heard.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.404
- Or haven't heard.

28:43.405 --> 28:45.889
- I want you two to report
back to headquarters at once!

28:45.891 --> 28:46.790
- At once?

28:47.560 --> 28:50.227
So you mean like, right now?

28:50.229 --> 28:52.596
- That's exactly what I mean.

28:52.598 --> 28:55.199
I need all of your
eight paws on deck

28:55.201 --> 28:57.968
for an emergency
Avenger Dog meeting.

28:57.970 --> 29:00.137
The landing dock
is cleared for you.

29:00.139 --> 29:01.705
There's no time to waste.

29:01.707 --> 29:04.341
Warp speed immediately!

29:04.343 --> 29:06.577
- An emergency meeting?

29:06.579 --> 29:09.713
We've never been called to
an emergency meeting before.

29:09.715 --> 29:11.281
- I know.

29:11.283 --> 29:12.883
It could only mean one thing.

29:12.885 --> 29:15.052
- That we're being rewarded?

29:15.054 --> 29:18.455
- No, that we're being fired.

29:18.457 --> 29:19.356
- Fired?

29:21.026 --> 29:24.394
Does that mean we get
to go back to the spa?

29:34.306 --> 29:36.673
- Well, you actually came.

29:36.675 --> 29:40.444
I half expected you two
to run or something.

29:40.446 --> 29:41.879
- We thought about it, Captain.

29:41.881 --> 29:45.415
That spa is open 24 hours.

29:45.417 --> 29:47.117
- But we decided it was better

29:47.119 --> 29:48.619
to come in and face the music.

29:48.621 --> 29:50.754
- You're here because
I want to send you

29:50.756 --> 29:53.090
through another
phase of retraining.

29:53.092 --> 29:57.327
When the survival of canines
throughout space depends on it,

29:57.329 --> 30:01.131
you can never undergo
too much training, boys.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.900
- Captain, with all due respect,

30:02.902 --> 30:05.202
if you don't think we're
cut out for this anymore,

30:05.204 --> 30:08.172
just say so.
- Please don't fire us.

30:08.174 --> 30:11.875
We love this job, we were
born to be Avenger Dogs.

30:11.877 --> 30:14.011
- That's the spirit, boys.

30:14.013 --> 30:16.446
Report to the bridge at once.

30:16.448 --> 30:19.183
Drill Sergeant
Butterball's waiting.

30:19.185 --> 30:22.486
- Alrighty,
play time's over, recruits.

30:22.488 --> 30:26.423
Eyes straight ahead, tails
up, ears at attention.

30:26.425 --> 30:28.725
You can call me Butterball.

30:28.727 --> 30:31.962
- Oh, boy, here we go!

30:31.964 --> 30:33.630
- You said what?

30:33.632 --> 30:35.766
- He was just clearing his
throat, sir.

30:35.768 --> 30:38.302
Doggy hair ball.

30:38.304 --> 30:42.372
- That lump in your throat's
not a hairball, it's fear.

30:42.374 --> 30:46.109
And fear's got no place here,
understand?

30:46.111 --> 30:47.444
Sir, yes, sir.

30:47.446 --> 30:50.747
- If you taste fear,
you will chew it up,

30:50.749 --> 30:53.884
spit it out, and ask
for another helping.

30:53.886 --> 30:55.986
You hear me?
- Sir, yes, sir.

30:55.988 --> 31:00.691
- Uh, I don't know
if I can do this.

31:00.693 --> 31:03.327
- If you can do this?

31:03.329 --> 31:06.129
You can and you will, dogface.

31:06.131 --> 31:07.397
That's an order!

31:07.399 --> 31:10.801
- Well at least he
didn't call me catface.

31:10.803 --> 31:12.669
- Drop down to dog position

31:12.671 --> 31:15.205
and start stretching
those muscles.

31:15.207 --> 31:19.076
It's time to get in shape
and become the car chasing,

31:19.078 --> 31:22.346
hydrant marking,
mailman biting warriors

31:22.348 --> 31:24.615
you were always meant to be.

31:24.617 --> 31:28.552
This is it,
you lazy sofa jockeys.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.587
Unleash the beast within!

31:31.657 --> 31:34.658
- Hurrah!
- Oh, boy.

31:34.660 --> 31:37.194
- Are you dogs hard of hearing?

31:37.196 --> 31:40.163
I said drop and give me 20!

31:40.165 --> 31:41.565
Now it's 30!

31:42.401 --> 31:44.501
You want to go for 40?

31:44.503 --> 31:46.937
- Sir, no, sir!
- No, sir!

31:51.777 --> 31:55.646
- Ah, there's nothing like
the delightful fragrance

31:55.648 --> 31:59.116
of pure catnip, Catbrain.

31:59.118 --> 32:01.084
If they made anything better,

32:01.086 --> 32:04.588
they surely kept it for
themselves.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.290
- They?

32:06.291 --> 32:07.991
Who's they, Professor
McTinkerClaws?

32:07.993 --> 32:11.328
- You know, they.

32:11.330 --> 32:15.365
- I uh, I really don't
know, that's why I'm asking.

32:15.367 --> 32:20.437
They, the they
who control things you know,

32:20.639 --> 32:22.572
behind the scenes.

32:22.574 --> 32:24.975
- Oh, like puppet masters?

32:24.977 --> 32:29.713
- Yes, like puppet masters.

32:29.715 --> 32:31.148
- Who are they exactly?

32:31.150 --> 32:33.750
- Well, that's just it,
Catbrain.

32:33.752 --> 32:38.155
They wouldn't be they if
we knew who they were.

32:39.425 --> 32:41.658
They can't be revealed or else

32:41.660 --> 32:44.328
they wouldn't be they anymore.

32:44.330 --> 32:47.731
- I get it, and they wouldn't
be able to pull the strings.

32:47.733 --> 32:49.266
- Exactly.

32:49.268 --> 32:50.867
They couldn't pull the strings

32:50.869 --> 32:53.870
if they too were
in the spotlight.

32:53.872 --> 32:57.140
Then they'd be puppets
and not puppet masters.

32:58.410 --> 33:00.410
- Gotcha, thanks
for clearing that up.

33:00.412 --> 33:03.146
- No worries, Catbrain.

33:04.083 --> 33:05.949
One thing I can
tell you for sure

33:07.052 --> 33:11.355
about they though,
they are cats.

33:11.357 --> 33:14.191
That's a fact.

33:14.193 --> 33:15.192
- Woof!

33:15.194 --> 33:17.027
Oops!
- What was that?

33:17.029 --> 33:17.861
- What was what?

33:17.863 --> 33:19.596
- What you just did there.

33:19.598 --> 33:21.765
Was that barking?

33:21.767 --> 33:22.666
- Barking?

33:23.469 --> 33:25.702
Hah, I don't bark,
I'm a cat, meow.

33:26.505 --> 33:29.072
- A cat with personality
problems.

33:29.074 --> 33:32.542
A cat in an identity crisis.

33:32.544 --> 33:34.211
- What? Me?

33:34.213 --> 33:37.614
No, don't be silly.
- I'm not being silly.

33:38.384 --> 33:42.185
I'm being serious,
I brainwashed you.

33:42.187 --> 33:44.421
I know you better than anyone.

33:44.423 --> 33:45.522
- Brainwashed me?

33:45.524 --> 33:47.891
What do you mean,
brainwashed me?

33:47.893 --> 33:48.725
- Huh?

33:48.727 --> 33:50.694
Oh, nothing, nothing.

33:52.164 --> 33:55.465
I meant I found you.

33:55.467 --> 33:57.567
- Found and brainwashed
are two tough

33:57.569 --> 34:00.404
words to mix up, Professor
McTinkerClaws.

34:00.406 --> 34:04.408
- It's the catnip
going right to my head.

34:05.711 --> 34:07.911
Too delightful to think
straight.

34:09.481 --> 34:12.114
I'll forget about it.

34:12.117 --> 34:12.983
- What should we do next, sir?

34:12.985 --> 34:15.851
- Hm, we'll do
what we always do when

34:15.853 --> 34:18.688
we have a little down time.

34:18.690 --> 34:20.791
Bully the dogs.

34:20.793 --> 34:22.559
- Fun, woof!

34:24.096 --> 34:25.695
Uh, maybe it's indigestion.

34:25.697 --> 34:27.297
- Must be that.

34:27.299 --> 34:30.434
Full steam ahead, Catbrain.

34:30.436 --> 34:32.803
Find us some dogs to terrorize.

34:46.618 --> 34:48.518
- You boys look beat.

34:48.520 --> 34:52.155
Butterball, tell me, how'd
these Avenger Dogs fair?

34:52.157 --> 34:55.559
- They are without a
doubt, the single worst duo

34:55.561 --> 34:59.029
I've ever had the displeasure
of trying to wrangle.

34:59.031 --> 35:02.632
Captain Fuzz Face,
genuinely inept.

35:02.634 --> 35:05.802
- Did he say adept?
- No, Space Lobber.

35:05.804 --> 35:09.473
He said inept.
- Oh.

35:09.475 --> 35:11.541
That's not good, right?
- Nope.

35:11.543 --> 35:15.545
- Them two dogs ought to be
reassigned to kennel duty, stat.

35:15.547 --> 35:19.883
And by kennel duty, I
mean cleaning the kennels.

35:19.885 --> 35:22.219
They simply don't
possess the confidence

35:22.221 --> 35:26.056
necessary to wear the
Avenger badge, Captain.

35:26.825 --> 35:28.425
- I see.

35:28.427 --> 35:32.996
So on a scale of zero to 10,
Drill Sergeant, would you--

35:32.998 --> 35:35.298
- Minus 20.
- Yikes.

35:36.401 --> 35:39.136
We created our
own end of the sale.

35:39.938 --> 35:41.571
That's gotta count for
something.

35:41.573 --> 35:43.740
- Yeah, it counts
us as the biggest

35:43.742 --> 35:46.810
screw ups the Avenger
Dog unit's ever seen.

35:46.812 --> 35:47.944
- Oh, hm.

35:50.015 --> 35:52.516
- Thank you for your
professional opinion,

35:52.518 --> 35:54.184
Sergeant Butterball.

35:54.186 --> 35:56.253
I'll take it into
advisement as we

35:56.255 --> 35:58.555
prepare to redeploy this team.

35:58.557 --> 36:00.757
- Redeploy?

36:00.759 --> 36:03.193
Captain, you're
not really considering

36:03.195 --> 36:06.897
redeployment
of those two, are you?

36:06.899 --> 36:09.900
- I am!
- Hey, did you hear that?

36:09.902 --> 36:13.370
We're not getting fired!
- Goodbye dog spa.

36:13.372 --> 36:15.205
- I beg to differ.

36:15.207 --> 36:19.476
These dogs are not ready for
a mission of such magnitude.

36:19.478 --> 36:23.280
Hey, maybe
Butterball is right.

36:23.282 --> 36:25.081
We should give
it a few more days.

36:25.083 --> 36:29.619
Eat well, rest up, we'll be
back better than ever, Captain.

36:29.621 --> 36:31.588
- Nonsense, Space Lobber.

36:31.590 --> 36:35.125
Our bone-iverse is in danger
right this very moment.

36:35.127 --> 36:38.628
Our bone marrow power
density calculator indicates

36:38.630 --> 36:43.733
that the fourth dimension
has lost another 436 million

36:43.735 --> 36:47.504
grams of bone meal since
last time we talked.

36:47.506 --> 36:51.141
Our galactic food source is
being stolen out from under us

36:51.143 --> 36:52.676
by the nanosecond.

36:52.678 --> 36:56.846
We must act now, lest we lose
everything.

36:56.848 --> 37:00.584
Our very survival's at stake.

37:00.586 --> 37:03.853
You said steak.

37:03.855 --> 37:06.556
I could eat,
is it dinnertime yet?

37:06.558 --> 37:08.391
- I've heard enough of this.

37:08.393 --> 37:11.428
I did my part and
that's all I can do.

37:11.430 --> 37:12.896
I'm out of here.

37:12.898 --> 37:15.065
- He doesn't have a lot
of faith in us, Captain.

37:15.067 --> 37:19.269
- I don't know how much
faith I have in us either.

37:19.271 --> 37:21.238
- Boys, all that matters is that

37:21.240 --> 37:23.406
you're willing to
give it another go.

37:23.408 --> 37:28.411
We all make mistakes and we
all fail, even the winners.

37:28.413 --> 37:31.648
- They do?
- Yes, they do.

37:31.650 --> 37:34.751
The important thing is that
you pick yourselves up,

37:34.753 --> 37:38.288
dust yourselves off, put
your ears to the wind,

37:38.290 --> 37:40.757
and your tongue
over your shoulders

37:40.759 --> 37:43.927
and charge back into the fire.

37:43.929 --> 37:45.495
- Fire?

37:45.497 --> 37:46.396
Uh, ow.

37:47.599 --> 37:50.033
- It's a figure of speech,
Space Lobber.

37:50.035 --> 37:53.570
What I mean is we
all fall down sometimes.

37:53.572 --> 37:57.073
It's those who get back
up that win the race.

37:57.075 --> 37:58.775
- We're gonna race?

37:58.777 --> 37:59.943
But cats are fast!

37:59.945 --> 38:02.646
You really think we can
beat McTinkerClaws, Captain?

38:02.648 --> 38:04.981
- Alright, no sense in
resisting.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.916
The bone-verse needs us, Slob.

38:06.918 --> 38:08.151
We'll do our best, Captain.

38:08.153 --> 38:09.452
We know what's on the line

38:09.454 --> 38:11.955
and we appreciate
the second chance.

38:13.325 --> 38:16.326
- Technically it is
our third chance.

38:16.328 --> 38:17.327
- Whatever.

38:17.329 --> 38:20.430
We're all in, sir.
- Thank you, boys.

38:20.432 --> 38:23.500
With your experience
and your track record,

38:23.502 --> 38:25.835
you're our best hope.

38:25.837 --> 38:29.572
Prepare for redeployment
momentarily.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.944
- Well that went well.
- Did it?

38:34.946 --> 38:37.147
I think everybody
we talked to lost

38:37.149 --> 38:40.684
all confidence in us completely.

38:40.686 --> 38:42.585
- Everyone except Captain Fuzz
Face,

38:42.587 --> 38:44.688
and his word is
the word that matters.

38:44.690 --> 38:48.892
- So, what do we do now?

38:48.894 --> 38:51.061
- I've been thinking about that.

38:51.063 --> 38:53.396
We have to hook
back up with Tuff Nut.

38:53.398 --> 38:54.798
- Tuff Nut?

38:54.800 --> 38:57.167
He doesn't believe in us either.

38:57.169 --> 38:59.469
- It doesn't matter.

38:59.470 --> 39:01.770
He knows the cosmic underbelly
like no other dog out there.

39:01.773 --> 39:04.307
- He is a dachshund after all.

39:04.309 --> 39:07.744
- He can lead us right to
McTinkerClaws, we need him.

39:07.746 --> 39:10.880
- But Sky, Tuff Nut
moves around a lot.

39:10.882 --> 39:12.749
He's slippery.

39:12.751 --> 39:14.884
There's no telling
where he'll be from

39:14.886 --> 39:16.886
one nanosecond to the next.

39:16.888 --> 39:19.589
And if Tuff Nut
doesn't want to be found,

39:19.591 --> 39:21.825
we'll never find him.

39:21.827 --> 39:25.228
We can't just snap our
paws and make him appear.

39:25.230 --> 39:27.364
- Sure we can.
- Oh yeah?

39:29.234 --> 39:30.133
How?

39:31.636 --> 39:33.536
Mm,
those bacon balls

39:33.538 --> 39:35.839
sure were tasty, you guys.

39:35.841 --> 39:36.806
Where'd you get 'em?

39:36.808 --> 39:37.974
- We made 'em, Tuff Nut.

39:37.976 --> 39:40.577
From our own
home-cooked Avenger recipe.

39:40.579 --> 39:44.047
- Well, thanks for leaving a
trail of them out in space.

39:44.049 --> 39:45.482
It's a good thing I found it.

39:45.484 --> 39:49.552
- You can say that again.
- Yeah, but why would I?

39:49.554 --> 39:51.388
I was clear the first time.

39:51.390 --> 39:53.790
If you didn't get it,
that's on you, you dig?

39:53.792 --> 39:55.058
- Uh.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.793
Uh, okay.

39:56.795 --> 40:00.296
- But listen, that bacon
ball recipe's something else.

40:00.298 --> 40:02.265
You dogs might have
a future on your paws

40:02.267 --> 40:04.634
after this whole space
police thing is over.

40:04.636 --> 40:06.603
- Oh yeah, you think so?

40:07.506 --> 40:10.840
- I'd buy a bag of bacon
balls all day long.

40:10.842 --> 40:12.809
But of course, I won't have to.

40:12.811 --> 40:15.011
As your close ally and
confidant,

40:15.013 --> 40:17.414
I would get free bacon balls.

40:17.416 --> 40:19.349
Right?
- That's right, buddy.

40:19.351 --> 40:22.585
But just between us,
the secret ingredient

40:22.587 --> 40:25.588
of our bacon balls
is in short supply.

40:25.590 --> 40:27.357
All this intergalactic
theft is making

40:27.359 --> 40:29.426
it tougher to make them.

40:29.427 --> 40:31.494
Pretty soon, our bacon balls
may be a thing of the past.

40:31.496 --> 40:33.763
- What?

40:33.764 --> 40:36.031
But I just ate my first
ones and now I'm hooked.

40:36.034 --> 40:37.267
What can I do to help?

40:37.269 --> 40:40.603
- First things first, we
gotta stop McTinkerClaws from

40:40.605 --> 40:43.673
raiding the bone-verse and taking all our bone marrow power.

40:43.675 --> 40:48.745
- We save the bone-verse,
we save the bacon balls.

40:48.747 --> 40:51.514
Get it?
- Yeah, I get it.

40:51.516 --> 40:53.516
I guess I can help you dogs.

40:53.518 --> 40:56.419
But strictly on the
down low, you hear?

40:56.421 --> 40:57.987
I'm getting a reputation around

40:57.989 --> 41:01.491
this galaxy as a tattletale
and I don't like it.

41:01.493 --> 41:05.228
- You're just getting that
reputation now?

41:05.230 --> 41:06.930
You've been a tattletale as long

41:06.932 --> 41:08.598
as we've known you, Tuff Nut.

41:08.600 --> 41:11.601
- Hey, you know, I don't
appreciate that.

41:11.603 --> 41:13.436
- He didn't mean to
offend you, Tuff Nut.

41:13.438 --> 41:17.006
Well, I did, kinda.

41:17.008 --> 41:19.843
- I'll have you know, my
image didn't take a hit until

41:19.845 --> 41:22.846
I started doing business
with the likes of you two.

41:22.848 --> 41:26.282
So, if I got a bad
reputation, you're to blame.

41:26.284 --> 41:27.884
- Us?

41:27.886 --> 41:29.986
Nobody every twisted your tail

41:29.988 --> 41:32.455
to be a part our last mission.

41:32.457 --> 41:34.307
- No?

41:34.308 --> 41:36.158
What about that time
on planet Toot-toot

41:36.161 --> 41:38.862
when you guys were looking
for Wet Snot the Setter

41:38.864 --> 41:42.298
and I was trying to finish
my beef jerky treat in peace.

41:42.300 --> 41:44.167
Oh, that.

41:44.169 --> 41:45.502
- Yeah, that.

41:45.504 --> 41:47.070
You both pinned me
down and twisted

41:47.072 --> 41:48.738
my tail 'til I gave him up.

41:48.740 --> 41:51.040
- That was a special case.

41:51.042 --> 41:53.977
He had a suitcase nuke and was
about

41:53.979 --> 41:56.779
to wipe Mars out
of the solar system.

41:56.781 --> 42:00.483
- Yeah, well, my beef jerky
fell down the storm drain

42:00.485 --> 42:02.318
and you never did
buy me another one.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.320
- Tuff Nut, if you want
another beef jerky,

42:04.322 --> 42:05.321
we'll get you one.

42:05.323 --> 42:08.258
- No kidding, for reals?
- For reals.

42:08.260 --> 42:10.026
Let's stop McTinkerClaws first.

42:10.028 --> 42:13.363
Then you can have all
the beef jerky you want.

42:13.365 --> 42:17.200
- Well, that's a tiger of
a different stipe, pal.

42:17.202 --> 42:19.235
All the beef jerky I want, huh?

42:19.237 --> 42:22.372
- Within reason.
- Which is it now?

42:22.374 --> 42:25.508
A beef jerky,
or all the beef jerky?

42:25.510 --> 42:27.043
Let's iron this thing out, guys.

42:27.045 --> 42:28.745
Or I ain't sayin' another word.

42:28.747 --> 42:31.481
- A few beef jerky
strips, a few?

42:31.483 --> 42:33.783
We'll get you a bag,
how's that sound?

42:33.785 --> 42:35.285
- A large bag.

42:35.287 --> 42:38.154
Okay, okay, a
large bag.

42:38.156 --> 42:41.658
- I mean like, not like
a trash bag or anything.

42:41.660 --> 42:43.560
- Let's stick to the
matter at hand, you guys.

42:43.562 --> 42:45.161
Which way do we go, Tuff Nut?

42:45.163 --> 42:47.597
- For beef jerky or
McTinkerClaws?

42:47.599 --> 42:48.765
- For the cat!

42:48.767 --> 42:50.400
Which way for the cat?

42:50.402 --> 42:54.337
- Okay, I don't know.
- You don't know?

42:55.373 --> 42:57.106
He doesn't know!

42:57.108 --> 42:59.275
- Hey, I never said I did,
capisce?

42:59.277 --> 43:01.878
But I got a friend on planet
Evergreen you should meet.

43:01.880 --> 43:04.247
She's a very smart and
courageous pup.

43:04.249 --> 43:07.183
- Planet Evergreen it is,
hang on!

43:31.977 --> 43:33.776
Well hello again.

43:34.579 --> 43:37.246
Why the long face, Captain?

43:41.086 --> 43:42.885
- Is that supposed to be funny,

43:42.887 --> 43:45.555
you over-hyped mouse catcher?

43:45.557 --> 43:46.956
- Funny?

43:46.958 --> 43:48.491
Why, no.

43:48.493 --> 43:50.627
It's supposed to be factual.

43:50.629 --> 43:53.062
Your snout makes you
look like nothing more

43:53.064 --> 43:56.899
than an upholstered
vacuum cleaner.

43:56.901 --> 44:01.971
And as for me being
over-hyped, believe the hype.

44:02.240 --> 44:06.075
This star system will
soon bear my name.

44:06.077 --> 44:08.144
Forget the milky way, mutt.

44:08.146 --> 44:13.016
McTinkerClaws Way is
the way of the future!

44:16.655 --> 44:20.923
Very soon you'll all be
obsolete.

44:20.925 --> 44:23.359
Prepare for oblivion.

44:33.438 --> 44:36.572
- Thank you for seeing us on
such short notice, Eugenia.

44:36.574 --> 44:38.508
I'd like you to meet my uh--

44:38.510 --> 44:39.942
- Your friends?

44:39.944 --> 44:41.144
- What? No!

44:41.146 --> 44:43.680
Gosh, no!
- Yeah, friends?

44:43.682 --> 44:44.614
No.

44:44.616 --> 44:47.884
- We're more like,
business partners.

44:47.886 --> 44:49.619
Not even.

44:50.789 --> 44:52.755
Like, business associates.

44:52.757 --> 44:54.323
- Even that's being generous.

44:54.325 --> 44:55.958
I just know these two.

44:55.960 --> 44:57.827
Like, I know their names.

44:57.829 --> 45:00.530
I can't even tell you a good
thing about 'em, really.

45:00.532 --> 45:03.599
- Forgive me for asking, but
if none of you are friends,

45:03.601 --> 45:05.768
why have you come to
see me at my home?

45:05.770 --> 45:08.071
I don't quarrel here.

45:08.073 --> 45:09.939
- Oh, me and
this guy are friends.

45:09.941 --> 45:12.575
This is Space Lobber,
he's my right hand pup.

45:12.577 --> 45:13.710
- Totally.

45:14.746 --> 45:15.878
I love this dog.

45:15.880 --> 45:19.115
Sky Fetcher's my brother
from another litter.

45:19.117 --> 45:21.417
No doubt.

45:21.419 --> 45:23.720
It's just this Tuff
Nut dude who's sketchy.

45:23.722 --> 45:25.488
He just helps us out sometimes.

45:25.490 --> 45:29.258
- But usually he's just a pain.

45:29.260 --> 45:31.961
- A super pain.
- Positivity.

45:31.963 --> 45:34.864
I want to hear
positivity from you dogs.

45:34.866 --> 45:36.933
Only good dogs
are admitted here.

45:36.935 --> 45:38.868
- He's not without
his good points.

45:38.870 --> 45:40.436
- He's kinda witty.

45:40.438 --> 45:44.073
- Eugenia, we're here because
the bone-verse is in trouble.

45:44.075 --> 45:45.375
- I'm aware.

45:45.376 --> 45:46.676
- We got off on the
wrong foot, Eugenia.

45:46.678 --> 45:49.345
Allow me to reintroduce us.

45:49.347 --> 45:53.249
I'm Sky Fetcher.
- And I'm Space Lobber.

45:53.251 --> 45:55.685
- And we're with
the Avenger Dogs.

45:55.687 --> 45:58.087
- Star hopping, comet chasing,

45:58.089 --> 46:01.057
villain vanquishing action dogs.

46:01.059 --> 46:04.494
- You boys work for
Captain Fuzz Face?

46:04.496 --> 46:06.162
Yes!

46:06.164 --> 46:09.365
- He promised me a box of
treats for my birthday.

46:09.367 --> 46:13.069
He's been ducking me
for two light years now.

46:13.071 --> 46:14.571
- Really?

46:14.572 --> 46:16.072
That doesn't sound like
our Captain at all.

46:16.074 --> 46:18.307
- No, it doesn't.

46:18.309 --> 46:20.143
He always remembers birthdays.

46:20.145 --> 46:24.781
- Hm, fine, I'll give him
the benefit of the doubt.

46:24.783 --> 46:27.049
I expect those treats or else

46:27.051 --> 46:30.486
I'm gonna be very angry at him.

46:30.488 --> 46:33.156
- Oh alright, Eugenia,
we'll let him know.

46:33.158 --> 46:34.357
- You'd better.

46:34.359 --> 46:37.160
I never forget names or faces.

46:37.162 --> 46:39.095
Now, what do you need me for?

46:39.097 --> 46:43.533
- Uh, we know who's
responsible for the attacks

46:43.535 --> 46:45.735
on the bone-verse,
Professor McTinkerClaws,

46:46.805 --> 46:48.738
but we don't know
where to find him.

46:48.740 --> 46:51.040
- Tuff Nut said you
might be able to help us.

46:51.876 --> 46:53.609
- Boys, the answer
to your questions

46:53.611 --> 46:56.345
lies within your own hearts.

46:56.347 --> 46:59.215
Within our own hearts?

46:59.217 --> 47:02.251
You mean we have heart worms?

47:02.253 --> 47:05.421
Oh no, those can be deadly!

47:05.423 --> 47:08.858
We need to seek
medical help right away!

47:08.860 --> 47:10.993
How long do we have, Eugenia?

47:10.995 --> 47:12.361
Tell us!

47:12.363 --> 47:15.698
How long?

47:15.700 --> 47:18.734
- Slob, calm down, we
don't have heart worms.

47:18.736 --> 47:21.971
But
she just said that--

47:21.973 --> 47:25.508
- Listen to everything I
say to you, Space Lobber,

47:25.510 --> 47:28.377
and all answers
will be revealed.

47:28.379 --> 47:30.646
When faced with
a feline assailant,

47:30.648 --> 47:34.217
one must realize that answers
can be unlocked like a puzzle

47:34.219 --> 47:36.686
and you need only look inside
for the key.

47:36.688 --> 47:41.757
- Oh, so that's what
microchips are for, huh.

47:42.327 --> 47:44.894
- Eugenia, we know
McTinkerClaws is the one

47:44.896 --> 47:47.897
who's trying to hurt us, but
we don't know how he possibly

47:47.899 --> 47:49.999
gained access to the bone-verse.

47:50.001 --> 47:53.803
- Yeah, you have to be a canine
to get in.

47:53.805 --> 47:56.005
- Unless he has help.

47:56.007 --> 48:00.076
That cat could be in
cahoots with a dog gone bad.

48:00.078 --> 48:01.410
- A bad dog?

48:01.412 --> 48:03.212
But who in the universe
would be bad enough

48:03.214 --> 48:05.915
to team up with
McTinkerClaws, of all cats?

48:11.322 --> 48:14.523
- What a master stroke,
Professor McTinkerClaws,

48:14.525 --> 48:16.859
you sure know how to make a paw
print.

48:16.861 --> 48:19.762
- That I do, Catbrain, that I
do.

48:21.699 --> 48:25.668
Did you see Captain Fuzz Face's
fuzzy face when I told him?

48:26.871 --> 48:30.539
Yeah, it sure
was a sight to behold.

48:30.541 --> 48:34.243
- I sure shocked the
shed out of him, alright?

48:35.280 --> 48:37.647
Now that he knows
what he's up against,

48:37.649 --> 48:42.485
he just might surrender
before this gets really ugly.

48:44.122 --> 48:45.855
- He will if he knows what's
good for him,

48:45.857 --> 48:47.690
Professor McTinkerClaws.

48:47.692 --> 48:49.058
- That's right.

48:49.060 --> 48:53.296
Now, before we scrap every
last bit of marrow power

48:53.298 --> 48:57.900
from the bone-verse and
pick it clean, let's eat!

48:57.902 --> 49:00.202
Route us to Space Jacks, pronto.

49:00.204 --> 49:04.640
I want a number four with
supersized sides of sardines

49:04.642 --> 49:08.044
and a milk and
anchovy space drink!

49:08.046 --> 49:10.379
- Alright, I'm lettin'
you dogs know up front

49:10.381 --> 49:13.082
that this is a real
special deal you got here.

49:13.084 --> 49:15.217
- You say every
deal's a special deal

49:15.219 --> 49:17.019
when you're involved, Tuff Nut.

49:17.021 --> 49:20.056
- Yeah well,
this one's super special.

49:20.058 --> 49:23.359
Eugenia doesn't leave her
castle on high for just anybody.

49:23.361 --> 49:24.694
- Thanks, Eugenia.

49:24.696 --> 49:26.562
- Don't mention it, boys.

49:26.564 --> 49:28.197
I'm a dog too, after all.

49:28.199 --> 49:30.566
I just can't sit by in clear
conscience

49:30.568 --> 49:32.735
and watch as
McTinkerClaws runs rough shot

49:33.705 --> 49:35.438
through the great bone-iverse.

49:35.440 --> 49:37.673
- Well it's nice to
have you aboard, ma'am.

49:37.675 --> 49:40.309
We're honored.
- That's more like it.

49:40.311 --> 49:42.678
See, wasn't so hard, was it?

49:42.680 --> 49:43.846
A little more
respect out of you two

49:43.848 --> 49:46.048
would be a nice change of pace.

49:47.018 --> 49:48.784
- Don't hold your breath, Tuff
Nut.

49:48.786 --> 49:51.487
- Tuff Nut, sir, let's try that.

49:51.489 --> 49:53.756
- I'm having flashbacks to
Butterball's basic training.

49:53.758 --> 49:55.958
- I know, right?

49:58.596 --> 50:01.964
- Boys, I want you know that
I am able to protect you

50:01.966 --> 50:04.600
from enemy fire with the
strength of the mighty

50:04.602 --> 50:09.038
universal ear perk for up
to five hundred kilometers.

50:09.040 --> 50:11.040
Anything after that, you
must defend yourselves.

50:11.042 --> 50:12.775
Thanks, Eugenia.

50:13.578 --> 50:18.180
- Uh, what's the mighty
universal ear perk?

50:18.182 --> 50:21.083
- It is the strongest
and purest force field

50:21.085 --> 50:25.421
known to outer space,
activated by the pup mind.

50:25.423 --> 50:28.257
- Whoa, like a dog trick?

50:28.259 --> 50:30.493
- No, lunkhead, not like a dog
trick.

50:30.495 --> 50:33.329
Eugenia's the real deal.
- Oh yeah?

50:33.331 --> 50:35.398
- Just remember boys, even
though you're shielded

50:35.400 --> 50:37.533
by the mighty
universal ear perk,

50:37.535 --> 50:41.504
the best offense is
always a good defense.

50:41.506 --> 50:45.007
Avoid conflict if you can,
fight hard if you must.

50:45.009 --> 50:46.675
Resort to the ear perk,

50:46.677 --> 50:50.413
only if all other
options have failed.

50:50.415 --> 50:52.148
- Don't you worry, Eugenia.

50:52.150 --> 50:54.517
We'll fight hard, alright.

50:54.519 --> 50:56.919
If I get my teeth
around that cat's tail,

50:56.921 --> 50:59.255
you'll have to pry me off.

50:59.257 --> 51:02.324
Hey,
speaking of bites,

51:02.326 --> 51:04.627
is anyone else hungry?

51:04.629 --> 51:06.862
- I could eat, what do
you have in mind, Slob?

51:06.864 --> 51:11.000
- Wanna swing by Space Jacks
for a bag of star nuggets?

51:11.002 --> 51:15.237
- Mm, I could go for some
steaming star nuggets.

51:16.140 --> 51:17.406
But what about the bone-verse?

51:17.408 --> 51:18.874
It's depleting by the
nanosecond.

51:18.876 --> 51:20.076
Do we have time?

51:20.078 --> 51:22.044
- Alas, time is relative.

51:22.046 --> 51:24.914
Some dog on a
distant planet is sitting

51:24.916 --> 51:27.083
in the shade right
now because another

51:27.085 --> 51:30.653
being planted
a tree long, long ago.

51:31.789 --> 51:32.688
- Wow.

51:33.558 --> 51:35.091
That's deep.

51:35.093 --> 51:37.059
- I told you she was amazing.

51:37.061 --> 51:38.727
- Also, if you're
going to Space Jacks,

51:38.729 --> 51:40.229
get me a number two special.

51:40.231 --> 51:42.631
Oh, oh, with sriracha sauce.

51:42.633 --> 51:43.899
- Will do, Eugenia.

51:43.901 --> 51:45.601
Space Jacks here we come!

51:58.015 --> 52:00.950
- Professor McTinkerClaws,
radar is picking up a space

52:00.952 --> 52:02.618
vessel at a half light year out

52:02.620 --> 52:03.752
and closing fast.

52:03.754 --> 52:05.454
- A vessel?

52:05.456 --> 52:06.822
Who is it?

52:06.824 --> 52:08.190
Are they armed?

52:08.192 --> 52:10.493
- Looks like it's
a canine ship, sir.

52:10.495 --> 52:11.894
- Canines?

52:11.896 --> 52:15.264
Oh, well they must be
headed to Space Jacks too.

52:15.266 --> 52:19.034
Activate our
invisible shield, Catbrain.

52:19.036 --> 52:22.071
We'll surprise those
bone-chasers at the fly through.

52:22.073 --> 52:24.940
They think they're going
to grab a quick bite,

52:24.942 --> 52:27.710
but it's us who
will be getting a bite

52:27.712 --> 52:29.612
of their behinds!

52:37.155 --> 52:38.687
Okay, listen up.

52:38.689 --> 52:40.556
Does everybody
have their orders ready?

52:40.558 --> 52:44.293
- I'll take a 10 piece,
no make it two 10 pieces.

52:44.295 --> 52:45.561
- Make that three!

52:46.898 --> 52:49.565
And a large fries with sea salt.

52:49.567 --> 52:52.201
And a chocolate
milkshake.

52:52.203 --> 52:53.869
- Tuff Nut, you're a dog!

52:53.871 --> 52:56.172
You're not supposed
to have chocolate.

52:56.174 --> 52:58.607
- Oh, yeah, make that vanilla.

52:58.609 --> 52:59.542
- I'll make it four.

52:59.544 --> 53:01.944
Vanilla shakes for everyone!

53:04.315 --> 53:05.214
- Surprise!

53:07.351 --> 53:10.452
Is somebody hungry?

53:11.455 --> 53:13.155
- What?

53:13.157 --> 53:15.925
Where'd he come from?
- Doesn't matter.

53:15.927 --> 53:17.960
All that matters
is we found him!

53:17.962 --> 53:19.662
Now we can stop him.

53:19.664 --> 53:23.165
- You sound awfully sure
of yourselves, dogs.

53:23.167 --> 53:26.168
Wanna try me?

53:26.170 --> 53:28.938
- Don't mind if we do,
McTinkerClaws.

53:28.940 --> 53:31.140
- Sky Fetcher,
remember what I said about

53:31.142 --> 53:32.841
the mighty universal ear perk.

53:32.843 --> 53:33.676
- Gotcha.

53:33.678 --> 53:35.211
So, we're protected, right?

53:35.213 --> 53:37.446
- Hit us with your
best shot, hairball.

53:37.448 --> 53:40.182
- Don't mind if I do.

53:40.184 --> 53:41.417
Take this!

53:48.526 --> 53:50.926
- Hey, that was a direct hit!

53:50.928 --> 53:54.296
What about that
mighty ear perk, Eugenia?

53:54.298 --> 53:56.298
- One of the basic
tenants of the ear perk

53:56.300 --> 53:58.767
is that you mustn't initiate
aggression.

53:59.570 --> 54:01.570
- In other words,
if you pick a fight,

54:01.572 --> 54:03.439
you're downtown
without a leash, pal.

54:03.441 --> 54:05.174
- We didn't pick the fight.

54:05.176 --> 54:07.610
He's been robbing
the bone-verse blind.

54:07.612 --> 54:10.412
He's trying to starve
us out of space.

54:10.414 --> 54:13.916
He just ambushed
us out of nowhere.

54:13.918 --> 54:16.986
What do you think he
wants to do, play frisbee?

54:16.988 --> 54:19.255
- Oh no, a frisbee.

54:19.257 --> 54:21.857
- Breathe, Sky, breathe.

54:23.060 --> 54:25.628
- Why the pouty snouts?

54:25.630 --> 54:28.230
Is something the matter, dogs?

54:28.232 --> 54:31.100
Finally realized that
you've met your match, hmm?

54:33.204 --> 54:35.704
- Never, you won't get
away with this, cat!

54:35.706 --> 54:38.707
Space Lobber, warm up
our boomerang lasers.

54:38.709 --> 54:41.944
If it's a fight this jerk
wants, it's a fight he'll get.

54:41.946 --> 54:44.446
- Oh, goodie.

54:45.616 --> 54:48.350
I love a good scrap.

55:09.140 --> 55:10.272
They're fighting
back, sir!

55:10.274 --> 55:12.441
Our left thrusters
have been disabled.

55:12.443 --> 55:14.994
- What?

55:14.995 --> 55:17.546
Nobody fights back against
McTinkerClaws, no body!

55:17.548 --> 55:20.683
It's time to play our
trump card, Catbrain.

55:20.685 --> 55:23.519
Look scared!
- I am scared!

55:23.521 --> 55:25.187
- Even better.

55:25.189 --> 55:29.291
Hold still, you're on
camera in three, two, one.

55:30.461 --> 55:34.897
- Tinkaroo, what are you
doing with McTinkerClaws?

55:34.899 --> 55:36.098
- Are you okay?

55:36.100 --> 55:38.133
He hasn't hurt you, has he?

55:38.135 --> 55:38.967
- Tinkaroo?

55:38.969 --> 55:39.902
Who's Tinkaroo?

55:39.904 --> 55:42.838
- It's you, you're Tinkaroo!

55:42.840 --> 55:44.540
- Oh, I am?

55:44.542 --> 55:46.275
I thought my name was Catbrain.

55:46.277 --> 55:48.344
- No, you're Tinkaroo!

55:49.213 --> 55:51.246
And you're a dog.

55:51.248 --> 55:52.247
- Oh, wow!

55:52.249 --> 55:54.750
I mean, oh bow-wow!

55:54.752 --> 55:57.086
Professor McTinkerClaws
says if I don't behave,

55:57.088 --> 56:00.456
he will give me clean
odorless slippers to chew.

56:00.458 --> 56:01.290
Ew!

56:01.292 --> 56:03.792
- Clean slippers?

56:03.794 --> 56:05.461
The monster!

56:05.463 --> 56:09.198
What's the joy of chewing
anything that doesn't stink?

56:09.200 --> 56:10.866
Torture!

56:10.868 --> 56:11.700
- I know, right?

56:11.702 --> 56:14.002
- Tinkaroo, you hang in there!

56:14.004 --> 56:17.072
We won't let McTinkerClaws
get away with this.

56:17.074 --> 56:18.807
I already have!

56:20.244 --> 56:24.079
- No matter what happens to
the bone-verse, Tinkaroo,

56:24.081 --> 56:27.349
we'll bring you
home safe and sound.

56:28.252 --> 56:29.618
That's a promise!

56:30.454 --> 56:32.521
- Tell them how scared you are.

56:32.523 --> 56:34.890
Tug at their heart strings.

56:34.892 --> 56:38.927
- Please, guys, I'm so scared
of those clean slippers, yuck!

56:38.929 --> 56:40.596
- Stay strong, Tink.

56:41.399 --> 56:43.165
We won't forget about you.

56:43.167 --> 56:44.633
- That's right!

56:44.635 --> 56:46.902
This fight's only just begun.

56:46.904 --> 56:48.537
- Says you, fleabag.

56:50.007 --> 56:54.710
I say it's over,
and the feline side wins.

56:58.849 --> 57:01.517
- Oh, please, please don't
give me those scent free

57:01.519 --> 57:04.353
slippers to chew on, mighty
Professor McTinkerClaws,

57:04.355 --> 57:06.722
they will surely
leave my mouth dry,

57:06.724 --> 57:10.159
my tail wagless
and my heart empty.

57:10.161 --> 57:12.761
- Wow, that's
beautiful canine haiku.

57:13.798 --> 57:17.566
You shall all
cower beneath my fearsome

57:17.568 --> 57:19.268
and legendary silhouette.

57:19.270 --> 57:24.039
Warp speed ahead, my
victorious destiny awaits!

57:24.041 --> 57:28.677
I said warp speed,
this isn't warp speed!

57:28.679 --> 57:31.747
We're basically crawling.

57:31.749 --> 57:34.383
Our left
thruster's disabled, remember?

57:34.385 --> 57:36.318
This is all the warp
we've got left.

57:36.320 --> 57:38.353
Well,
press the throttle,

57:38.355 --> 57:40.656
fly a figure eight or something.

57:40.658 --> 57:42.257
Let's hide behind a meteor.

57:42.259 --> 57:45.194
I left them with such
an emphatic statement.

57:45.196 --> 57:48.664
Creeping away like this
is so anti-climatic.

57:48.666 --> 57:50.699
Yes, sir,
Professor McTinkerClaws.

57:53.170 --> 57:55.137
- Blast, this is
worse than we thought.

57:55.139 --> 57:59.208
McTinkerClaws has a
hostage and it's Tinkaroo!

57:59.210 --> 58:01.610
What in the universe
are we gonna do now?

58:01.612 --> 58:05.647
- Uh, one thing's for sure,
this is a game-changer.

58:05.649 --> 58:08.217
We need to return to
headquarters right away.

58:08.219 --> 58:10.085
Captain Fuzz Face has to know

58:10.087 --> 58:12.621
about this before
we make another move.

58:13.491 --> 58:14.723
- Oh, lovely.

58:14.725 --> 58:16.658
I can confront your
captain in person

58:16.660 --> 58:18.894
and get my birthday gift.

58:18.896 --> 58:20.362
He'll hear about this.

58:22.099 --> 58:24.199
- It might be better if
we drop you off, Eugenia.

58:24.201 --> 58:25.767
- Have it your way.

58:25.769 --> 58:29.404
The mighty universal
ear perk goes with me.

58:29.406 --> 58:34.510
- Well, it's not like it
did us much good this time.

58:35.779 --> 58:38.380
- Uh, guys, what
about Space Jacks?

58:38.382 --> 58:41.149
- Forget Space Jacks,
Tuff Nut, this is serious!

58:41.151 --> 58:43.619
- So is dinner,
can we just grab it to go?

58:43.621 --> 58:44.520
No!

58:56.967 --> 59:00.869
- Doctor Henbrain, we hear
you have something to tell us.

59:00.871 --> 59:03.639
- Indeed I do, officers!

59:03.641 --> 59:05.173
I'll cut right to the chase.

59:05.175 --> 59:07.743
Are either of you
familiar with the mega

59:07.745 --> 59:09.978
neutron dimensional destructor?

59:09.980 --> 59:11.480
- The what?

59:11.482 --> 59:12.915
- Say no more.

59:12.917 --> 59:15.350
This is the weapon
currently being used

59:15.352 --> 59:18.253
by the cat called McTinkerClaws,

59:18.255 --> 59:21.924
to pilfer precious bone marrow
power from our bone-iverse.

59:21.926 --> 59:25.093
It's reverse redactor
function allows him to cull

59:25.095 --> 59:27.996
10 times the marrow
power that we can collect

59:27.998 --> 59:31.466
with our paws alone in
a fraction of the time.

59:31.468 --> 59:35.103
- We know, the galactic
marrow power's almost gone!

59:35.105 --> 59:37.639
The bone-verse is
practically a grave yard.

59:37.641 --> 59:40.609
- Aye, and it will
be unless we can

59:40.611 --> 59:42.844
disable his infernal device.

59:42.846 --> 59:45.647
- How in the stars
can we do that?

59:45.649 --> 59:49.318
I've already forgotten
what the thing's called.

59:49.320 --> 59:50.752
- Come on, Space Lobber.

59:50.754 --> 59:53.288
It's the mega sonic dimensional
didactic!

59:53.290 --> 59:55.924
Wait, wait, no,

59:55.926 --> 01:00:00.295
it was the megatronic
dimension discipliner.

01:00:00.297 --> 01:00:01.396
Right, doctor?

01:00:01.398 --> 01:00:04.166
- You're both completely wrong.

01:00:04.168 --> 01:00:06.051
Oh.

01:00:06.052 --> 01:00:07.935
- It's the mega neutron
dimensional destructor.

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:11.640
- That's what I said.
- No, that's what I said.

01:00:11.642 --> 01:00:14.610
- Neither of you said it, but
that's neither here nor there.

01:00:14.612 --> 01:00:17.946
The good news is I've
devised a way to stop it.

01:00:17.948 --> 01:00:19.715
- You have?

01:00:19.717 --> 01:00:21.467
Tell us!

01:00:21.468 --> 01:00:23.218
- There's no time for
demonstration, sadly.

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:27.489
We must act and act fast if we
want to save our bone-iverse.

01:00:27.491 --> 01:00:29.992
- We're ready,
what do we do, doctor?

01:00:29.994 --> 01:00:31.827
- See Lieutenant Rufflebuns,

01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:33.729
he'll lead you through the next
steps.

01:00:33.731 --> 01:00:36.798
- You mean like, an obstacle
course?

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.434
I need to stretch first if
we're gonna get physical.

01:00:39.436 --> 01:00:41.303
- Space Lobber.
- What?

01:00:42.172 --> 01:00:44.006
- You're not cramped?

01:00:44.008 --> 01:00:47.142
We've been scrunched up in
that space ship for so long.

01:00:48.078 --> 01:00:51.546
I love coming back to headquarters just to stretch my legs.

01:00:51.548 --> 01:00:53.248
- If it's stretching you want,

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:55.751
I don't think you boys
will be disappointed.

01:00:55.753 --> 01:00:58.186
See Lieutenant Rufflebuns, you
dolts.

01:00:58.188 --> 01:01:00.889
He'll instruct you on what to do
next.

01:01:00.891 --> 01:01:02.758
Okay.

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.826
Lieutenant
Rufflebuns!

01:01:04.828 --> 01:01:06.528
Doctor Henbrain said you--

01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:09.364
- Whatever that pooch
said, don't believe it.

01:01:09.366 --> 01:01:11.633
Henbrain's out of his canine
mind.

01:01:11.635 --> 01:01:14.302
All that time in the laboratory
by himself

01:01:14.304 --> 01:01:18.373
has made him cuckoo, loco,
bonkers!

01:01:18.375 --> 01:01:21.309
- But he's a brilliant doctor!

01:01:21.311 --> 01:01:23.278
It comes with the territory.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:27.082
He's always been a little bit
eccentric.

01:01:27.084 --> 01:01:32.154
- Yes, well, he talks to test
tubes now and they talk back.

01:01:33.257 --> 01:01:35.023
- They do?
- Mm-hm.

01:01:35.025 --> 01:01:37.325
In all kinds of voices.

01:01:37.327 --> 01:01:40.495
Oh,
yeah, that's batty.

01:01:40.497 --> 01:01:41.897
- Nutty as a squirrel.

01:01:41.899 --> 01:01:43.765
- Anyway, forget it.

01:01:43.767 --> 01:01:46.568
If this whole thing works
out, you won't have to deal

01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:50.439
directly with Doctor
Henbrain anymore, understand?

01:01:50.441 --> 01:01:53.442
- If what whole thing
works out, Lieutenant?

01:01:53.444 --> 01:01:56.344
- Go see Officer McAdoo in her
quarters.

01:01:56.346 --> 01:01:58.714
She'll explain everything!

01:02:02.419 --> 01:02:04.853
- There's no time to mince
words, boys!

01:02:04.855 --> 01:02:07.889
I need to take both your
measurements, immediately!

01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:11.359
We're gonna fit you for
a new top secret garment.

01:02:11.361 --> 01:02:13.795
- Oh, we're getting new outfits?

01:02:13.797 --> 01:02:16.698
Are they
thundershirts?

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:18.834
I'd love a new thundershirt.

01:02:18.836 --> 01:02:20.869
- I can't tell you
anymore right now.

01:02:20.871 --> 01:02:23.872
This operation is top secret.

01:02:23.874 --> 01:02:28.110
It's our last chance to save
the bone-verse and if it fails.

01:02:29.046 --> 01:02:31.646
- Are you just gonna
leave us hanging?

01:02:31.648 --> 01:02:33.949
What happens if it fails?

01:02:33.951 --> 01:02:35.450
What happens?

01:02:35.452 --> 01:02:37.719
- Space Lobber, calm down.

01:02:37.721 --> 01:02:41.156
- But I need to
know the hard truth.

01:02:41.158 --> 01:02:44.059
- I'll give you the
hard truth, mutts.

01:02:44.061 --> 01:02:47.996
The bone-verse is gone
forever, and so are we!

01:02:47.998 --> 01:02:52.134
- Oh, yeah, that's some
heavy stuff right there.

01:02:54.204 --> 01:02:57.205
Sorry I asked.
- Yeah, me too.

01:02:57.207 --> 01:02:59.508
- You really think
now's the time

01:02:59.510 --> 01:03:02.210
to be trying on
new outfits, McAdoo?

01:03:02.212 --> 01:03:05.113
Shouldn't we be planning a
counter attack, or something?

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:08.350
- Sometimes I don't know how
you made it this far, mutts.

01:03:08.352 --> 01:03:10.369
I really don't.

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:12.387
Alright, come on, we need
to see if these suits fit.

01:03:12.389 --> 01:03:14.356
- Oh, maybe they'll fit us with

01:03:14.358 --> 01:03:17.325
sweet tuxes like
double O canine?

01:03:17.327 --> 01:03:20.228
- We'll be totally cool!

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:25.267
- Ah, there you are!

01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:26.735
How do they fit, boys?

01:03:26.737 --> 01:03:28.570
- Uh, how do they fit?

01:03:28.572 --> 01:03:30.906
I feel vacuum packed.

01:03:30.908 --> 01:03:31.907
- I'll say!

01:03:31.909 --> 01:03:33.675
Tight squeeze is an
understatement.

01:03:33.677 --> 01:03:35.410
What are we doing in
these get ups, Captain?

01:03:35.412 --> 01:03:38.547
- What we've been doing all
along, boys!

01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:40.949
Saving the bone-iverse!

01:03:40.951 --> 01:03:45.287
- Wait, you're not expecting
us to moonwalk, right?

01:03:45.289 --> 01:03:48.957
- If that's what it
takes, Space Lobber, yes.

01:03:48.959 --> 01:03:52.294
You're Avenger Dogs,
you never quit,

01:03:52.296 --> 01:03:56.231
never tire, never rollover.

01:03:56.233 --> 01:03:58.567
- Never take a
deep breath, apparently.

01:03:58.569 --> 01:04:00.735
- Hey, speaking
of deep breathes,

01:04:00.737 --> 01:04:01.970
what if one of these skin tight

01:04:01.972 --> 01:04:03.705
suits splits a seam, Captain?

01:04:03.707 --> 01:04:07.542
- Yeah, I had beef stroganoff
at dinner last night

01:04:07.544 --> 01:04:10.345
and I feel a little gassy.

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:13.448
- Checking if a little
gas is okay, Captain.

01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:16.718
- Yeah, making sure we all ask
the right questions, Captain,

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.753
given the universe is at stake.

01:04:18.755 --> 01:04:21.239
- Yeah.

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:23.724
- You two know anything
about zero gravity implosion?

01:04:23.727 --> 01:04:25.527
- Uh, about what?

01:04:25.529 --> 01:04:27.028
- I think he means
beef stroganoff

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:29.297
for dinner was not
a good idea, Slob.

01:04:29.299 --> 01:04:33.034
- Those space suits will allow
you to vacate your new ship

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:36.238
and let it act as a
decoy while you paddle

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:39.608
through the stars, breach
McTinkerClaws' vessel,

01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:43.078
sneak aboard,
surprise and overtake him,

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:45.814
and disable that weapon of his.

01:04:45.816 --> 01:04:49.551
- The meganoodle
tricks-o-matic densifier!

01:04:49.553 --> 01:04:50.819
- Once you've done that,

01:04:50.821 --> 01:04:53.555
you can pilot his
ship back to yours,

01:04:53.557 --> 01:04:56.458
shackle McTinkerClaws in the
titanium cat

01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:58.960
cage we've installed in your
storage hull,

01:04:58.962 --> 01:05:02.597
and return here where
we'll hold him for trial.

01:05:02.599 --> 01:05:04.266
- What about Tinkaroo, Captain?

01:05:04.268 --> 01:05:07.602
Should he be
considered friend, or foe?

01:05:07.604 --> 01:05:11.740
- I know it's hard to turn your
backs on a fellow dog, boys.

01:05:11.742 --> 01:05:14.976
But until Tinkaroo
proves otherwise,

01:05:14.978 --> 01:05:17.913
he should be treated as a cat.

01:05:17.915 --> 01:05:19.648
- I don't believe it!

01:05:19.650 --> 01:05:23.218
Tinkaroo, a dog-gone
tuna sucking cat?

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:25.253
What's this galaxy coming to?

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:27.689
- If you have no
more questions, boys,

01:05:27.691 --> 01:05:32.427
your new decoy ship is
fueled up and ready to fly.

01:05:32.429 --> 01:05:34.429
Dog speed, boys!

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:38.433
The entire canine species
is counting on you!

01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:49.945
- The entire canine
species is counting on you?

01:05:51.048 --> 01:05:52.113
Talk about pressure.

01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:54.082
I don't know if
I can do this, Sky.

01:05:54.084 --> 01:05:56.017
- Sure you can,
this is it, buddy.

01:05:56.019 --> 01:05:58.620
The moment we can finally
shake off our past phobias

01:05:58.622 --> 01:06:03.091
and become the dogs we know
we can be, Avenger Dogs!

01:06:03.093 --> 01:06:04.192
Are you with me?

01:06:04.194 --> 01:06:08.830
- No, I mean, yes,
I think, probably.

01:06:08.832 --> 01:06:10.765
Here we
go, radar's picked up

01:06:10.767 --> 01:06:12.701
McTinkerClaws'
ship just up ahead

01:06:12.703 --> 01:06:14.636
moving westward around Mars.

01:06:14.638 --> 01:06:16.938
- I'm scared, Sky.

01:06:16.939 --> 01:06:19.239
I've never been outside our
ship in deep space before.

01:06:19.242 --> 01:06:21.943
What if we get
sucked into a black hole?

01:06:21.945 --> 01:06:24.446
- Space Lobber,
we can't think like that.

01:06:24.448 --> 01:06:26.514
We have to stay positive.

01:06:26.516 --> 01:06:28.650
- That's easy for you to say.

01:06:28.652 --> 01:06:31.119
You were a champion
dog paddler back home.

01:06:31.121 --> 01:06:33.021
I never did learn to swim.

01:06:33.023 --> 01:06:36.858
- Just remember, we're not
swimming, we're flying.

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:41.529
You can't drown, you can't
even fall, there's no gravity.

01:06:41.531 --> 01:06:42.931
We're only floating.

01:06:42.933 --> 01:06:44.933
All you gotta do is
paddle in the direction

01:06:44.935 --> 01:06:47.502
you wanna go and you'll get
there.

01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:52.007
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, let's do it quick,

01:06:52.009 --> 01:06:54.442
before I lose my nerve.
- That's the spirit!

01:06:54.444 --> 01:06:57.078
- McTinkerClaws,
a slow moving ship

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:58.446
has entered our radar field.

01:06:58.448 --> 01:07:01.016
It's right behind us,
moving in our jet stream.

01:07:01.018 --> 01:07:02.517
- Following us?

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:04.586
How dare they!

01:07:04.588 --> 01:07:06.821
Does this ship show
identification?

01:07:07.858 --> 01:07:09.891
- Nothing, sir, it's unmarked.

01:07:09.893 --> 01:07:11.559
Possibly a cargo vessel.

01:07:11.561 --> 01:07:15.764
- Well, they'd better hope
they're hauling escape pods,

01:07:15.766 --> 01:07:18.833
because I'm going to blast
them out of the stars.

01:07:19.803 --> 01:07:22.737
- You are?
- No, Catbrain.

01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:24.172
Technically you are!

01:07:25.809 --> 01:07:26.941
- I am?

01:07:26.943 --> 01:07:28.543
I mean, I am!

01:07:28.545 --> 01:07:32.313
Meow, readying our laser
cannons, sir!

01:07:32.315 --> 01:07:35.817
- Let the ship
get a little closer first.

01:07:35.819 --> 01:07:40.321
I want to watch as they're
blown to smithereens.

01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:44.292
- Meow, sir!

01:08:16.326 --> 01:08:17.725
Direct hit, sir.

01:08:17.727 --> 01:08:19.661
The ship's destroyed.

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:23.231
- Excellent, good shooting,
Catbrain.

01:08:23.233 --> 01:08:26.600
That'll show 'em to try
sneaking up on McTinkerClaws!

01:08:28.305 --> 01:08:30.238
And yet,
here we are!

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.874
- Huh, who said that?

01:08:32.876 --> 01:08:34.742
- The Avenger Dogs!

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:36.277
- The Avenger Dogs?

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:38.746
How did you get
on board my ship?

01:08:38.747 --> 01:08:39.647
- It was easy.

01:08:41.017 --> 01:08:42.684
Well, not really.

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:46.220
But easier since we squeezed
out of those tight space suits.

01:08:46.223 --> 01:08:49.390
- You ain't kiddin' buddy,
at least we can breath now.

01:08:49.392 --> 01:08:52.527
- Come on, Tinkaroo,
you're coming with us.

01:08:52.529 --> 01:08:53.428
- I am?

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:56.163
I mean, I am!

01:08:56.166 --> 01:08:57.499
Oh, thank goodness!

01:08:57.501 --> 01:08:59.067
I thought you'd never find me.

01:08:59.069 --> 01:09:01.502
I was brainwashed into
thinking I was a cat.

01:09:01.505 --> 01:09:04.906
But, the trick wore off,
and I finally remembered who

01:09:04.908 --> 01:09:08.143
my real friends and family are.

01:09:08.145 --> 01:09:10.895
- What?

01:09:10.897 --> 01:09:13.648
But I fed you, cared for you,
played Scrabble with you,

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:15.683
your traitorous little

01:09:15.685 --> 01:09:18.086
- Zip it, sandpaper tongue.

01:09:18.087 --> 01:09:22.122
We're dogs, we stick
together, and we win.

01:09:23.059 --> 01:09:25.960
Get used to it!
- Oh, yeah?

01:09:25.962 --> 01:09:29.163
We'll see how far you dogs
get with no bone marrow

01:09:29.166 --> 01:09:34.234
for treats, to see your
precious bone-verse is empty.

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:37.071
Bone dry as they say!

01:09:40.343 --> 01:09:42.143
- Guess again, litter box feet.

01:09:42.145 --> 01:09:44.746
While you were busy shooting
down our decoy ship,

01:09:44.747 --> 01:09:48.950
we were busy recalibrating
your little toy.

01:09:48.952 --> 01:09:50.051
- My little toy?

01:09:51.254 --> 01:09:52.086
What?

01:09:52.087 --> 01:09:52.921
What have you done to the mega

01:09:52.923 --> 01:09:55.423
neutron dimensional destructor?

01:09:55.425 --> 01:09:57.926
- Oh nothing,
it's still shiny as new.

01:09:57.928 --> 01:10:01.229
- Sure is,
we just read the manual

01:10:01.231 --> 01:10:03.464
and switched it
to reverse density,

01:10:03.466 --> 01:10:06.367
then set it to
overdrive and let it rip.

01:10:06.369 --> 01:10:10.038
- Yup, check out
the bone-verse now!

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:10.872
- What?

01:10:10.874 --> 01:10:12.640
That cannot be!

01:10:12.642 --> 01:10:15.009
You can't regain
bone marrow power once

01:10:15.011 --> 01:10:18.880
it's been obliterated,
it's not possible!

01:10:18.882 --> 01:10:22.850
- Oh we didn't regain it,
we duplicated what was left.

01:10:22.852 --> 01:10:25.620
- Yeah, and then we triplicated
and quadruplicated it.

01:10:27.224 --> 01:10:31.593
- That's right, we set your
weapon to duplicate to infinity.

01:10:31.595 --> 01:10:33.761
Then we broke it.

01:10:33.763 --> 01:10:35.296
- You what?

01:10:35.298 --> 01:10:37.565
- You heard
him right, kitty cat.

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:41.035
We busted your little toy
into a million pieces.

01:10:41.037 --> 01:10:43.404
- There's no getting
that thing to work again.

01:10:43.406 --> 01:10:44.872
That's for sure.

01:10:44.874 --> 01:10:46.274
- You cretins!

01:10:46.276 --> 01:10:50.144
The mega neutron dimensional
destructor was my life's work!

01:10:51.147 --> 01:10:52.947
My masterpiece!

01:10:54.251 --> 01:10:55.717
My legacy!

01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:59.220
- Not anymore it isn't.

01:10:59.222 --> 01:11:03.358
- Yup, it's pretty much a hunk
of sheet metal and bolts now.

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:06.928
- You smelly, sniveling
space mutts will regret this.

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:09.430
- Maybe.
- Maybe not.

01:11:09.432 --> 01:11:11.432
- I'd bet on definitely.

01:11:11.434 --> 01:11:14.135
I will rebuild!

01:11:14.137 --> 01:11:15.036
I will return!

01:11:15.939 --> 01:11:19.107
I will have my revenge!

01:11:20.744 --> 01:11:22.010
- Yeah, whatever.

01:11:22.012 --> 01:11:23.278
What do you say
we suit up and blow

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:25.446
this popsicle stand,
Space Lobber?

01:11:25.448 --> 01:11:27.615
- Sounds good to me!

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:37.992
Uh oh!
- Uh oh?

01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:41.529
Why uh oh?

01:11:41.531 --> 01:11:43.798
- We don't have
a suit for Tinkaroo.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.034
How are we going to take
him back to our ship?

01:11:46.036 --> 01:11:50.738
- Hah, I told you you mangy
mutts wouldn't get far.

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:52.874
You can't even pull off a proper
cou

01:11:54.577 --> 01:11:56.778
without bungling everything!

01:11:56.780 --> 01:12:00.048
Oh,
I hate it when he's right.

01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:02.617
- It's okay, guys,
leave me behind.

01:12:02.619 --> 01:12:03.484
I'll be okay.

01:12:03.486 --> 01:12:04.585
- No way, Tink.

01:12:04.587 --> 01:12:06.621
We leave no dogs behind.

01:12:06.623 --> 01:12:11.759
- His name is Catbrain
and he's with me.

01:12:11.761 --> 01:12:14.295
I'm not letting you go
without a fight, mister.

01:12:14.297 --> 01:12:19.334
I've come to enjoy your
canine comradery at times.

01:12:21.104 --> 01:12:25.173
Not always, you know,
but often enough.

01:12:25.175 --> 01:12:27.542
You're not the most doltish dog

01:12:27.544 --> 01:12:30.545
I've ever encountered,
I'll give you that.

01:12:30.547 --> 01:12:32.780
- Oh, Professor McTinkerClaws,

01:12:32.782 --> 01:12:34.615
I've never heard you
say such a nice thing.

01:12:34.617 --> 01:12:39.320
- Yeah, it was kinda nice
for Professor McTinkerClaws.

01:12:39.322 --> 01:12:41.756
- I didn't think he
was capable of this!

01:12:41.758 --> 01:12:43.124
- Neither did I!

01:12:43.927 --> 01:12:47.895
- Well, enjoy it,
mongrels, 'cause it's about

01:12:47.897 --> 01:12:50.998
to be the last thing you ever
hear.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.300
- Is that a threat?

01:12:52.302 --> 01:12:53.401
- I'm pretty sure.

01:12:53.403 --> 01:12:56.571
- Now it's time for
you to get these claws.

01:12:59.376 --> 01:13:01.109
What? How?

01:13:01.111 --> 01:13:02.009
Where did they go?

01:13:02.011 --> 01:13:03.745
Where did they go?

01:13:05.648 --> 01:13:06.481
- I don't know, sir.

01:13:06.483 --> 01:13:09.117
They just disappeared.

01:13:09.119 --> 01:13:11.786
- Well, look around,
you numbskull.

01:13:11.788 --> 01:13:14.422
They couldn't have
gotten very far.

01:13:16.509 --> 01:13:18.593
- Whoa, what just happened?
- Are we dead?

01:13:19.396 --> 01:13:20.895
Is this heaven?

01:13:20.897 --> 01:13:23.431
- No, Space Lobber,
it's not heaven.

01:13:23.433 --> 01:13:24.599
But it's close.

01:13:24.601 --> 01:13:26.768
It's good ol' outer space.

01:13:26.770 --> 01:13:29.904
But I'm flattered you see
me as a heavenly creature.

01:13:29.906 --> 01:13:31.472
- I told you boys
the mighty universal

01:13:31.474 --> 01:13:34.642
ear perk could
come in handy, didn't I?

01:13:34.644 --> 01:13:36.444
- You used the perk on us?

01:13:36.446 --> 01:13:39.080
You transported us out
of McTinkerClaws' ship?

01:13:39.082 --> 01:13:40.848
- It's all true.

01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:44.652
- But Tinkaroo,
we left him behind.

01:13:44.654 --> 01:13:45.987
We gotta go back!

01:13:45.989 --> 01:13:49.857
- Going back risks your
victory into a defeat, boys.

01:13:49.859 --> 01:13:51.259
You accomplished your mission,

01:13:51.261 --> 01:13:53.027
destroyed McTinkerClaws' weapon,

01:13:53.029 --> 01:13:55.430
and restored the
bone-verse, correct?

01:13:56.199 --> 01:13:58.032
- Well, let's see.

01:13:58.034 --> 01:14:00.768
Take a look for yourselves!

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:01.669
- Wow!

01:14:02.839 --> 01:14:05.039
Look at all these bones!

01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:08.609
I ain't seen this many
bones in all my life!

01:14:08.611 --> 01:14:10.678
It's incredible.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:11.946
- We did it, you guys!

01:14:11.948 --> 01:14:13.981
The bone-verse is thriving!

01:14:13.983 --> 01:14:16.017
There's enough bone
marrow power here to feed

01:14:16.019 --> 01:14:18.786
whole generations of dogs!

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:22.190
- And McTinkerClaws lost his
weapons of mass destruction.

01:14:23.593 --> 01:14:27.895
All's right with the
bone-verse and the universe.

01:14:27.897 --> 01:14:29.797
Except for poor Tinkaroo.

01:14:29.799 --> 01:14:32.567
He sacrificed his
dog-ness for the cause.

01:14:32.569 --> 01:14:36.404
- Yeah, he's a real hero.

01:14:36.406 --> 01:14:37.805
We'll see him again, though.

01:14:37.807 --> 01:14:40.708
- You think so?
- I know so.

01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:42.944
Come on,
let's head home and tell

01:14:42.946 --> 01:14:44.879
Captain Fuzz Face the good news.

01:14:44.881 --> 01:14:48.382
- Hey, can we swing by Space
Jacks fly-through on the way?

01:14:48.384 --> 01:14:50.785
I've been thinking about
those 10 piece nuggets

01:14:50.787 --> 01:14:53.254
and vanilla shakes
since last time.

01:14:53.256 --> 01:14:56.290
Fine, Tuff
Nut, we'll go by Space Jacks.
