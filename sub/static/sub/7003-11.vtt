WEBVTT

00:07.807 --> 00:11.009
Well, we continue
our week-long salute...

00:11.010 --> 00:14.079
<i>(toilet flushes)</i>

00:14.080 --> 00:15.614
...To bathrooms.

00:15.615 --> 00:18.016
We've already finished
our basic plumbing
installation process.

00:18.017 --> 00:19.884
Now we move on
to a thing called style.

00:19.885 --> 00:23.254
Women call this
"accessorizing the bathroom."

00:23.255 --> 00:27.325
We gotta talk
about some of this stuff.
Like, what are these things?

00:27.326 --> 00:30.228
This is a flower decal
to prevent slipping
in your tub.

00:30.229 --> 00:33.131
I have these at home.

00:33.132 --> 00:35.834
Why doesn't that surprise me?

00:35.835 --> 00:37.969
Now, men, what do you wanna do?
Stand on a decal like this,

00:37.970 --> 00:41.940
Or the new m1 battle tank
series?

00:41.941 --> 00:45.343
Or you could use
what I use at home -
the al decal.

00:47.412 --> 00:51.616
So you step all over me
like you do here?
I like taking my work home.

00:51.617 --> 00:54.786
Toilet seat and seat covers.
Seat covers?

00:54.787 --> 00:58.757
Men don't need a seat cover.
We don't even need a squishy
seat like this.

00:58.758 --> 01:02.060
Toilet seats were just invented
so women won't fall in.

01:02.061 --> 01:04.428
<i>(woman screams)</i>
<i>(splash)</i>

01:06.098 --> 01:08.566
Now, here's a toilet seat, huh?

01:12.471 --> 01:15.073
What is in this?
Barbed wire.

01:16.475 --> 01:18.877
And these - a woman's idea
of soap by the bath.

01:18.878 --> 01:23.214
<i>(lisps)</i> little roses
and little hearts and pigs.

01:23.215 --> 01:25.750
How do you lather up
with a pig?

01:25.751 --> 01:28.787
Goodness knows you've tried.

01:28.788 --> 01:32.891
What men need...
Big bruiser soap like this.

01:34.960 --> 01:38.863
Football soap.
Football soap
on a rope, al.

01:38.864 --> 01:41.666
Perfect for the underarms,

01:41.667 --> 01:44.069
The ears...
<i>(soap squeaks)</i>

01:45.470 --> 01:47.806
Al, get naked, go long.

01:50.409 --> 01:52.844
You were gonna do that
for a minute, weren't you?

03:02.714 --> 03:05.183
Well, what do you think?
Should we put the kids
in the middle?

03:10.089 --> 03:12.623
Whoa, mom, why did we get
such a big turkey?

03:12.624 --> 03:15.860
I thought grandma and grandpa
aren't coming over
for thanksgiving.

03:15.861 --> 03:20.098
Well, who can blame them
after the food fight
you started last year?

03:20.099 --> 03:23.701
Hey. Nana got in a couple
of nice shots, all right?

03:25.805 --> 03:27.772
The reason we have
such a big turkey

03:27.773 --> 03:30.508
Is because al and ilene
are coming.

03:30.509 --> 03:32.310
Al's bringing a girl?

03:32.311 --> 03:36.247
Yeah, she's that dentist
who makes
all the teeth jokes.

03:36.248 --> 03:37.982
She's an orthodontist.

03:37.983 --> 03:41.219
And the way your teeth
are coming in,
you'd better be nice to her.

03:41.220 --> 03:42.954
Ok, guys,
will you go back out

03:42.955 --> 03:45.223
And get the rest
of the groceries?

03:46.558 --> 03:48.126
Honey, great news.

03:48.127 --> 03:50.261
The lumber showed up
and I'm ready to roll.

03:50.262 --> 03:53.798
Lumber? What's that for?
Uh... <i>(laughs)</i>

03:53.799 --> 03:55.967
I went by the lumberyard.
I had a vision.

03:55.968 --> 03:58.169
Yeah, you have a vision
every time you go
by the lumber yard.

03:58.170 --> 04:01.439
That's why when I'm in the car
we never go that way.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.174
Remember, you said this year

04:03.175 --> 04:05.676
You didn't wanna take
the same old boring
christmas card photo.

04:05.677 --> 04:09.447
Yeah. Now, what are
you building?
And don't even think about it.

04:09.448 --> 04:11.449
This'll be great.
I got this vision

04:11.450 --> 04:13.885
That'll capture
the real spirit
of the taylor family,

04:13.886 --> 04:15.186
Just like we really are.

04:15.187 --> 04:17.755
Oh, tim, these pictures
are going out to my family.

04:17.755 --> 04:20.925
I don't want them to know
who we really are.

04:22.294 --> 04:24.028
You're not sharing my vision.

04:24.029 --> 04:27.332
That is what makes
our marriage work.

04:27.333 --> 04:28.833
Could you just listen
to me, please?

04:28.834 --> 04:30.368
I'm thinking
of something simple.

04:30.369 --> 04:32.670
You know, decorating the tree,
hanging the tinsel,

04:32.671 --> 04:35.473
Stringing popcorn,
that kind of stuff.

04:35.474 --> 04:38.376
I was thinking
the exact same thing.
Oh.

04:38.377 --> 04:43.414
Except we'd be wearing costumes
at the north pole.

04:45.717 --> 04:49.087
And the "exact same thing" part
would be what?

04:49.088 --> 04:52.690
Wait. Hey, guys, guys, guys,
come here. Come here.

04:52.691 --> 04:57.262
Which would you rather do
for this year's
christmas card photo?

04:57.263 --> 04:59.898
String popcorn, hang tinsel,
get around the tree,

04:59.899 --> 05:03.234
Or dress up
in real cool costumes

05:03.235 --> 05:06.938
And join me in tim taylor's
christmas village?

05:06.939 --> 05:09.107
They both sound stupid.
I agree.

05:09.108 --> 05:11.842
Me too.

05:11.843 --> 05:13.844
They'll come around.
Honey, come on.

05:13.845 --> 05:15.846
We can start a new tradition.
Think of the possibilities.

05:15.847 --> 05:17.982
This year,
the christmas village.
Next year -

05:17.983 --> 05:21.852
Manger on the moon.
You'd be in a spacesuit.

05:21.853 --> 05:23.854
I don't wanna be on the moon.

05:23.855 --> 05:26.024
Besides, everybody knows
a spacesuit adds 20 lbs.

05:26.025 --> 05:27.725
Oh, honey.

05:27.726 --> 05:30.061
Look, whatever happens,

05:30.062 --> 05:31.729
If you don't like it
I guarantee you

05:31.730 --> 05:34.732
We'll change it
and do it your way.

05:34.733 --> 05:38.602
You promise
you won't get carried away?

05:38.603 --> 05:40.438
Yes.

05:42.441 --> 05:43.808
Ok.

05:43.809 --> 05:45.910
<i>(doorbell)</i>

05:45.911 --> 05:48.413
It'll be perfect,
and don't worry about anything.

05:48.414 --> 05:51.416
It'll be tasteful and simple.

05:51.417 --> 05:52.750
Hey. Ooh.

05:52.751 --> 05:55.719
I got a reindeer here
for a tim taylor.

06:00.059 --> 06:04.062
Does everybody know
what time it is?
Tool time!

06:04.063 --> 06:06.064
That's right. Binford tools
is proud to present

06:06.065 --> 06:09.233
Tim "the tool man" taylor!
Whoo!

06:13.472 --> 06:16.107
Thank you, heidi.

06:16.108 --> 06:18.776
And welcome
to tool time's salute...

06:18.777 --> 06:20.178
<i>(toilet flushes)</i>

06:20.179 --> 06:21.579
...To bathrooms.

06:21.580 --> 06:23.114
Hi, I'm tim "the tool man"
taylor.

06:23.115 --> 06:24.615
You all know my assistant al

06:24.616 --> 06:28.319
"it's my potty, I'll cry
if I want to" borland.

06:29.955 --> 06:32.190
You can't resist
the bathroom humor,
can you, tim?

06:32.191 --> 06:35.526
Not during our salute...
<i>(toilet flushes)</i>

06:35.527 --> 06:37.128
...To bathrooms.

06:37.129 --> 06:38.762
You remember last time
I was telling you

06:38.763 --> 06:41.232
How bathrooms have become
a woman's domain.

06:41.233 --> 06:42.800
Well, not anymore,
since the crew and I

06:42.801 --> 06:44.869
Designed and built
the bathroom for men only.

06:44.870 --> 06:47.571
Guys, bring out my bathroom.

06:47.572 --> 06:50.074
<i>(â™ª "also sprach zarathustra")</i>

07:11.430 --> 07:14.732
The man's bathroom.
100%, you guessed it,
stainless steel.

07:14.733 --> 07:17.701
That's right.
A man's can. A john's john.

07:17.702 --> 07:20.838
This will be on every man's
christmas list this year.

07:20.839 --> 07:22.907
We're gonna take you
through a typical male day
in the bathroom.

07:22.908 --> 07:25.209
Al, what's the first thing
you do when you get up?

07:25.210 --> 07:27.778
I say to myself, "oh, boy,
another wonderful day

07:27.779 --> 07:32.350
Of working side by side
with tim."

07:32.351 --> 07:34.485
What's the second thing
you do, al?

07:34.486 --> 07:37.888
I consider calling in sick.

07:37.889 --> 07:39.357
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

07:39.358 --> 07:41.459
Why don't we go
through my typical day then?

07:41.460 --> 07:46.030
I get up, I scratch,
I get in the bathroom.

07:46.031 --> 07:48.232
First I wanna get rid of
that horrible morning breath.

07:48.233 --> 07:51.135
You got everything here
you need.
You got your soap.

07:51.136 --> 07:54.238
You got a little bit
of your mouthwash.

07:55.740 --> 07:58.476
No, that's the soap.
That's the mouthwash.

08:01.547 --> 08:03.681
To get that deep-down,
manly dirt off,

08:03.682 --> 08:06.417
You gotta jump
in your multihead shower.

08:06.418 --> 08:08.586
<i>(satisfied moans)</i>

08:11.523 --> 08:13.757
Hop out, stand over
your built-in floor drain.

08:13.758 --> 08:16.260
Gotta get dry real quick.

08:16.261 --> 08:18.429
<i>(dryer buzzes)</i>

08:21.533 --> 08:25.769
I'm dry. Well, ready to shave.
I can't shave in the dark.

08:25.770 --> 08:27.805
I'll need my trusty...

08:27.806 --> 08:29.907
Headlights!

08:29.908 --> 08:34.178
Also useful in case a deer
wanders into your bathroom.

08:36.248 --> 08:39.984
For those pesky nose hairs,
you flip on your brights.

08:46.592 --> 08:49.860
All right, all right.

08:49.861 --> 08:53.030
Well... The bathroom
has everything,

08:53.031 --> 08:57.635
Including the brand-new
la-z-bowl reclining toilet.

09:10.249 --> 09:13.083
It's plush when you flush.

09:13.084 --> 09:15.553
And jukebox, phone
and a rack

09:15.554 --> 09:17.788
For your hot rod magazines
within easy reach.

09:17.789 --> 09:20.090
If there were
a refrigerator in here,

09:20.091 --> 09:22.560
You'd never have to leave.

09:22.561 --> 09:25.229
Did you say "if"?

09:32.538 --> 09:34.972
Brewski?
You bet, buddy.

09:34.973 --> 09:37.007
Between the beer
and the bathroom,

09:37.008 --> 09:40.178
We call this
a male recycling center

09:40.179 --> 09:43.214
Guys are going, "jeez, tim,
you spend so much time
in the bathroom,

09:43.215 --> 09:45.049
You won't know what's going on
in the big game."

09:45.050 --> 09:47.652
Got it covered.

09:50.789 --> 09:52.756
Go, go, go, go!

09:52.757 --> 09:54.758
<i>(both)</i> touchdown!

10:10.775 --> 10:16.247
Man, once my friends
see this christmas card,
I'm dead.

10:16.248 --> 10:20.451
There's no way
I'm wearing these ears.
Me neither.

10:20.452 --> 10:22.453
What?

10:24.189 --> 10:26.190
Dad can't make us do this.

10:26.191 --> 10:29.059
Yeah. I mean, you can't
make your kid be an elf.

10:29.060 --> 10:31.395
There's gotta be a law.

10:33.998 --> 10:37.268
Hey, dad, we have something
to talk to you about.

10:37.269 --> 10:38.802
Hey.

10:40.805 --> 10:43.474
Welcome to
santa's christmas village.

10:43.475 --> 10:45.909
Dad, we don't
wanna be elves.
What?

10:45.910 --> 10:49.913
Yeah. We thought you said
we could all be elvis.

10:51.516 --> 10:55.319
<i>(jill)</i> I can't believe
this is the outfit
you chose for me.

11:00.359 --> 11:03.561
Mrs. Claus would never wear
anything this skimpy.

11:03.562 --> 11:05.363
Sure she would,
if santa were out of town

11:05.364 --> 11:08.098
And mr. Mountie
was stopping by.

11:10.034 --> 11:12.603
I thought you said
you were gonna
keep this simple.

11:12.604 --> 11:14.438
It is simple.
Guys, get into position,
please.

11:14.439 --> 11:18.276
Dad, we don't wanna do this.
Oh, pipe down.
Just one shot.

11:18.277 --> 11:20.177
Tim, look, you know,
thanksgiving's tomorrow.

11:20.178 --> 11:22.313
I got pies in the oven,
a million things I gotta do.

11:22.314 --> 11:26.284
Relax, all of you. Let me make
a few tweaks on my little
snow-making machine here.

11:26.285 --> 11:29.287
Why do we have
to have snow?
Well, if there's no snow,

11:29.288 --> 11:30.954
People won't believe
that we're really
in the north pole.

11:30.955 --> 11:33.056
You are so deluded.

11:37.896 --> 11:41.432
All right.
You're all there? Ok.
<i>(randy)</i> come on, dad.

11:41.433 --> 11:42.966
All right. Quiet!
Big smiles.

11:42.967 --> 11:45.903
Get the ears on. Smiles.
Timer's on.

11:48.440 --> 11:50.441
Start the snow.
All right.

11:52.611 --> 11:54.945
Hey, dad, there's no snow.

12:11.496 --> 12:13.197
<i>(tim)</i> I'll just get
a new window in it.

12:13.198 --> 12:16.467
Where are you gonna get
a pane of glass the night
before thanksgiving?

12:16.468 --> 12:19.002
There's plenty of
24-hour glass places open
on the holidays.

12:19.003 --> 12:21.305
Yeah, right.

12:21.306 --> 12:25.209
What's that smell?
<i>(gasps)</i> oh, gosh.
It's my pies.

12:25.210 --> 12:27.211
Oh, no!

12:28.513 --> 12:30.481
Oh, tim!

12:30.482 --> 12:33.384
You promised me
this was gonna be simple.
Now look -

12:33.385 --> 12:37.020
I have burnt pies,
a broken window and a snow
blower in my family room!

12:38.557 --> 12:42.360
You're not gonna let this
dampen your spirits, are you?

12:42.361 --> 12:44.395
I am way past damp.

12:47.332 --> 12:49.734
Well, I'll just make
a little adjustment.
We'll be back in business.

12:49.735 --> 12:52.002
No. Forget it.
You had your chance,

12:52.003 --> 12:55.740
You blew it - big surprise -
and now...

12:55.741 --> 12:58.008
It's my turn.

12:58.009 --> 13:00.944
Honey, honey, honey.

13:00.945 --> 13:03.814
It'll be great.
We could make
christmas card history here.

13:03.815 --> 13:07.217
Why can't you just ever
do anything on a small scale?

13:07.218 --> 13:09.687
I don't think that way.

13:10.622 --> 13:12.956
Pick a number.
What?

13:12.957 --> 13:15.125
Just pick a number.
Seven.

13:15.126 --> 13:19.263
See?
I would've picked 13,000.

13:19.264 --> 13:22.600
Why? Because I think big.

13:22.601 --> 13:25.803
Can you burn the turkey
so it matches those pies?

13:32.911 --> 13:34.545
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

13:34.546 --> 13:36.547
What is that I smell?

13:36.548 --> 13:39.850
Burnt pumpkin pie
with a touch of cinnamon...

13:39.851 --> 13:43.253
Maybe a tad too much nutmeg?

13:43.254 --> 13:45.255
That is amazing.
You can smell that
from over there?

13:45.256 --> 13:48.191
Oh, yes, indeedy, tim.
I inherited my father's
olfactory sense.

13:48.192 --> 13:50.193
Your dad has an old factory?

13:50.194 --> 13:53.431
No, tim. I was referring
to my sense of smell.

13:53.432 --> 13:56.500
What does that have to do
with your dad's old factory?
Let it go, tim.

13:57.936 --> 14:00.771
Do you have any use
for a slightly used
santa village?

14:00.772 --> 14:05.075
Uh-oh.
Trouble in santa's workshop?

14:05.076 --> 14:08.913
Mrs. Claus doesn't understand
I'm trying to do
something groundbreaking.

14:08.914 --> 14:11.248
Mm-hmm. Well, I see
you've already done
some window-breaking.

14:11.249 --> 14:14.685
Wilson, I break a lot of things
around here because I think big.

14:14.686 --> 14:16.687
I get these visions,
I have to carry them out.
Ok?

14:16.688 --> 14:19.256
Oh, so you think of yourself
as a visionary,

14:19.257 --> 14:21.258
Like socrates or marco polo.

14:21.259 --> 14:23.393
<i>(grunts)</i>

14:25.063 --> 14:28.298
But jill thinks
I got double vision.

14:28.299 --> 14:31.268
Well, to paraphrase seneca,
the roman moralist,

14:31.269 --> 14:35.238
There is a fine line
between genius and madness.

14:39.711 --> 14:41.979
Do you think
I've stepped over that line?

14:41.980 --> 14:43.647
Tim, why don't you ask me
that question

14:43.648 --> 14:47.050
When you're not wearing
that mountie uniform?

14:47.051 --> 14:49.487
Oh, yeah.
That would be a good idea.

14:49.488 --> 14:52.590
I think you're overlooking
something here.
What?

14:52.591 --> 14:56.426
The true vision
is right there.

14:56.427 --> 14:58.863
An angry wife
with two burnt pies?

14:58.864 --> 15:02.399
No. No, tim -
a loving family.

15:02.400 --> 15:06.470
Yeah. Right as usual, wilson.

15:06.471 --> 15:08.873
Hey, hey, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
<i>(wilson)</i> yo.

15:08.874 --> 15:10.908
Pick a number.
Any number?

15:10.909 --> 15:14.177
Any number.
Well, off the top
of my head,

15:14.178 --> 15:16.647
762 trillion.

15:25.323 --> 15:28.191
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

15:28.192 --> 15:30.995
Oh.

15:30.996 --> 15:32.663
I can't believe al.

15:32.664 --> 15:34.899
All he's done since we've got
here is watch football.

15:34.900 --> 15:37.902
Yeah, well, tim's idea
of the perfect thanksgiving

15:37.903 --> 15:39.637
Would be to push a button
on the remote

15:39.638 --> 15:41.639
And have the turkey
pop out of it.

15:41.640 --> 15:44.909
He's gone, he's gone!
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go!

15:44.910 --> 15:46.911
Oh.

15:46.912 --> 15:49.513
Tim, take the helmet off
and come to dinner.

15:49.514 --> 15:52.583
It's not over yet, honey.
We have two more minutes left.

15:52.584 --> 15:56.887
What's the score?
Uh, 61 to three.

15:56.888 --> 16:00.658
Guess what. It's over.
Oh, honey!

16:00.659 --> 16:03.761
Come on, come on.
<i>(tim)</i> all right, let's eat.

16:03.762 --> 16:05.763
Here you go.
You sit right there.

16:05.764 --> 16:07.665
<i>(al)</i> oh, boy,
the table looks great.

16:07.666 --> 16:09.667
Smells great.
Oh, yes.

16:09.668 --> 16:11.435
Thank you.

16:11.436 --> 16:14.972
Everything looks delicious.
Hey, what are those?

16:14.973 --> 16:17.975
Oh, these are the, um,
mashed rutabagas
that al brought.

16:17.976 --> 16:21.178
Made from a very old
family recipe.

16:21.179 --> 16:24.314
Looks like you got 'em
from an old family.

16:24.315 --> 16:26.450
I love the way you guys
tease each other.

16:26.451 --> 16:28.886
I'm not teasing him.

16:28.887 --> 16:31.455
Ilene is no slouch
in the humor department.

16:31.456 --> 16:34.257
Tell them that joke you
told me on the way over.
Oh, no.

16:34.258 --> 16:36.961
Come on. We'd love to hear it.

16:36.962 --> 16:39.162
Ok. What do you call

16:39.163 --> 16:41.865
A big white animal
that's shaped like a tooth?

16:41.866 --> 16:44.301
What?
A molar bear.

16:48.573 --> 16:51.508
Stop.
You are such a wacky-doodle.

17:00.619 --> 17:03.787
Uh... Somebody pass me
the gravy, please.

17:03.788 --> 17:05.990
You gotta try ilene's rolls.
They're homemade.

17:05.991 --> 17:08.224
Ooh, look at that turkey.

17:08.226 --> 17:11.595
<i>(al)</i> try my rutabagas.
Let me have some
mashed potatoes.

17:11.596 --> 17:15.531
Try the rutabagas.
I put sugar in them this year.

17:15.532 --> 17:19.103
Can I have some of this,
please?
One spoonful.

17:19.104 --> 17:21.570
All right.

17:21.571 --> 17:25.474
I need the rutabagas.
All I need is some gravy.
I didn't get...

17:26.944 --> 17:29.980
Ah. I think before we eat,

17:29.981 --> 17:32.883
We should all think of something
that we're thankful for.

17:32.884 --> 17:34.885
Oh, that's a great idea.

17:34.886 --> 17:37.688
Al, you wanna go first?

17:37.689 --> 17:39.923
All right. Uh...

17:39.924 --> 17:43.827
Well, I'm...
I'm thankful that I have
such wonderful friends.

17:45.163 --> 17:47.497
And I'm... I'm thankful

17:47.498 --> 17:50.000
That I have such
a wonderful, special person

17:50.001 --> 17:53.503
To spend thanksgiving with.

17:53.504 --> 17:55.873
Well, I'm thankful that I have
such a wonderful place

17:55.874 --> 17:57.908
To come to on thanksgiving,

17:57.909 --> 18:01.378
And I'm thankful to jill
for introducing me to al.

18:01.379 --> 18:04.114
That's sweet.
That's nice. Brad?

18:04.115 --> 18:05.949
Al, a tender,

18:05.950 --> 18:09.086
Warm and gentle man

18:09.087 --> 18:11.922
Who always puts my needs
above his own.

18:11.923 --> 18:14.058
Oh, that's great.
Brad, I think your mom wants...

18:14.059 --> 18:17.394
A man whose quiet confidence

18:17.395 --> 18:20.164
And heroic vulnerability

18:20.165 --> 18:23.433
Inspire me
to be a better person.

18:23.434 --> 18:25.002
It's my turn.

18:25.003 --> 18:28.005
I'm thankful that ilene's
finished with her tribute to al.

18:28.006 --> 18:30.841
Ow!

18:30.842 --> 18:34.078
And I'm thankful
that brad said that
instead of me.

18:34.079 --> 18:36.113
Ow!

18:36.114 --> 18:41.018
I'm thankful you guys
are kicking brad and randy
instead of me.

18:41.019 --> 18:43.087
Well... <i>(clears throat)</i>

18:43.088 --> 18:46.023
That was very touching, boys.

18:46.024 --> 18:47.991
Can I go next? Can I go next?

18:47.992 --> 18:50.160
I am thankful
for many things in my life.

18:50.161 --> 18:53.130
My family, my friends...

18:53.131 --> 18:54.798
My hot rod,

18:54.799 --> 18:57.835
267 power tools that I own.

18:57.836 --> 18:59.737
I know I get carried away
sometimes,

18:59.738 --> 19:01.671
Like my fellow visionary
marco polo,

19:01.672 --> 19:04.441
Who we all know
invented the sport shirt.

19:04.442 --> 19:07.711
But, unlike marco polo,
I have something
he does not have.

19:07.712 --> 19:12.682
I have the best,
most understanding wife
in the world,

19:12.683 --> 19:15.352
Jill.

19:19.224 --> 19:22.626
Well, um, ok.

19:22.627 --> 19:24.995
I'm thankful
for good friends,

19:24.996 --> 19:27.664
For my children,

19:27.665 --> 19:31.268
For a husband who never ceases
to amaze and surprise me,

19:31.269 --> 19:35.639
A man who's blown out
every window in the house,

19:35.640 --> 19:37.975
Frozen his tongue to a hammer,

19:37.976 --> 19:41.678
Fallen off the roof,
through the roof,

19:41.679 --> 19:44.915
Hung upside down from the roof,

19:44.916 --> 19:47.251
And in spite of
all these things,

19:47.252 --> 19:52.589
Or maybe even because of them,

19:52.590 --> 19:55.225
I love him more today

19:55.226 --> 19:58.695
Than I did the day
I married him.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.668
Would somebody hold me?

20:16.915 --> 20:20.350
All right, I'm all ready.
Come on.
Ok.

20:20.351 --> 20:23.220
You're ok with this?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's a perfect compromise.

20:23.221 --> 20:26.423
Your winter wonderland,
my little bit of dignity...

20:26.424 --> 20:29.359
Ok, al, I'm all set.
Uh, camera's loaded.

20:29.360 --> 20:32.129
Boys are in position.
Come on, look up straight.

20:32.130 --> 20:34.031
I added more touch,
added more snow
for the roof there.

20:34.032 --> 20:36.133
How does that look?
Oh, that's...

20:36.134 --> 20:39.536
That's an awful lot
of snow, tim.

20:39.537 --> 20:42.539
That's 'cause
I think big, al
it looks beautiful.

20:42.540 --> 20:45.042
Thanks, ilene.
Al, you wanna do the honors?
No.

20:45.043 --> 20:47.610
<i>(tim)</i> come on.
I'm just kidding.

20:51.115 --> 20:52.816
So much for the dignity.

20:52.817 --> 20:55.719
There's still time
for you to slip into
that mrs. Claus outfit.

20:55.720 --> 20:59.489
Later.
<i>(grunts)</i>

20:59.490 --> 21:01.591
Is this where
you're gonna stand?
Yeah.

21:01.592 --> 21:03.760
Get the snow in front.
Make sure the kids
are looking ahead.

21:03.761 --> 21:06.063
<i>(al)</i> ok, I got it.
All right,
I'm gonna count to three.

21:06.064 --> 21:08.098
One,

21:08.099 --> 21:09.766
Two...

21:09.767 --> 21:12.202
Do you want that door open?
No.

21:12.203 --> 21:14.537
<i>(creaking)</i>
<i>(al)</i> three.

21:32.957 --> 21:35.859
Let's take one more
just to make sure.

21:46.470 --> 21:50.240
<i>(tim)</i> this is the life,
huh, al?
<i>(al)</i> I think so, tim.

21:50.241 --> 21:53.277
Nothing like a bowl game
on the bowl, huh?

21:56.214 --> 21:58.982
You know, I'm still
a little hungry.
No junk food.

21:58.983 --> 22:02.052
Let's order in.
Mexican, chinese,
what do you want?

22:02.053 --> 22:03.853
Oh, nothing too spicy.

22:03.854 --> 22:06.890
Al, I think you're
forgetting where you are.

22:10.929 --> 22:13.263
You're right.
Let's go a little crazy.

22:13.264 --> 22:16.199
How about a pizza
with sausage and chili?

22:16.200 --> 22:19.336
All right, buddy.

22:19.337 --> 22:21.038
<i>(phone dials)</i>

22:21.039 --> 22:23.573
Auto-dial.

22:23.574 --> 22:26.043
Yeah, tony's.
This is tim over here
at <i>tool time.</i>

22:26.044 --> 22:29.913
We need a big pizza.
Chili, anchovies...

22:29.914 --> 22:31.681
Half.
Half anchovies.

22:31.682 --> 22:34.351
We're not upstairs
in the office, though.
Come down to the...

22:34.352 --> 22:37.120
We're actually
in the bathroom. Yeah.

22:37.121 --> 22:40.357
What? Hello?
<i>(dial tone)</i>

22:40.358 --> 22:43.360
We're gonna have to
go pick it up, I think.

22:43.361 --> 22:46.163
Is that a smudge on that tv?

22:46.164 --> 22:48.832
Yes, I believe it is.
Not anymore.

22:56.140 --> 22:57.975
Yes!

23:01.179 --> 23:03.180
Honey, great news.

23:03.181 --> 23:05.849
The lumber was delivered...

23:16.527 --> 23:19.529
I walked by the lumberyard
today and I had a vision.

23:19.530 --> 23:21.898
You get a vision
every time you go
by the lumberyard.

23:21.899 --> 23:23.867
That's why when I in the...
When I'm in the car...

23:23.868 --> 23:26.136
<i>(mumbles)</i>
