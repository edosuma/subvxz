WEBVTT

00:04.880 --> 00:06.471
Well, it's the least we could do.

00:07.520 --> 00:09.556
Yeah, I'll...I'll take those, love.

00:11.560 --> 00:15.189
<i>Oh, um... I sent Pete and Jenny
some flowers.</i>

00:15.280 --> 00:18.989
Why?
- Because she's had a miscarriage.

00:19.080 --> 00:22.072
Why did you send flowers? I sent flowers.

00:22.160 --> 00:26.631
I had no idea you were intending to.
- What, and it didn't occur to you that I might?

00:30.640 --> 00:32.710
Bloody hell! Who are those from?

00:32.800 --> 00:34.119
Karen and David...

00:35.160 --> 00:36.309
David and Karen.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.914
They must be really upset, poor things.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.434
You'd think
people would have a bit more imagination.

00:41.520 --> 00:42.555
Jen!

00:42.640 --> 00:45.712
Shouldn't you send bouquets
to people with something to celebrate,

00:45.800 --> 00:49.349
like, you know, an anniversary
or a newjob, or somethlng,

00:49.440 --> 00:51.396
not losing a bloody baby!

00:51.480 --> 00:54.950
I mean, what do flowers do, anyway?

00:55.040 --> 00:59.079
<i>Nothing. They just sit there,
reminding you of why they were sent to you.</i>

00:59.160 --> 01:01.913
And then they die.
I've got that to look forward to, haven't I?

01:02.000 --> 01:05.959
I wish people would send me something useful,
like a ruddy great box of chocolates.

01:06.040 --> 01:07.996
I hate sodding flowers, anyway.

01:10.440 --> 01:11.793
Although yours were very nice.

01:14.360 --> 01:15.315
Pete.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:32.280 --> 01:33.998
Sorry.
- Not at all.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.316
What?
- You.

01:45.400 --> 01:48.870
What?
- Back there with Pete and Jen.

01:48.960 --> 01:52.270
Mm. Wasn't exactly my finest hour, was it?

01:53.320 --> 01:55.276
Enough of our misery.

01:55.360 --> 01:58.113
Cheer us up. Tell us about yours.

01:58.200 --> 02:00.839
We're not miserable.
- No, actually, we're on a high.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.229
We're gonna...
We've decided we're going to adopt.

02:03.320 --> 02:05.276
We're going to have a baby, aren't we?

02:06.600 --> 02:10.639
So sorry, Jen. That's really, really
tactless of me.

02:10.720 --> 02:14.156
No, you're all right. Funny old world,
isn't it?

02:14.240 --> 02:16.196
Last week I was expecting, now you are.

02:16.280 --> 02:18.271
They took it quite well, really.

02:18.360 --> 02:20.316
Allthings considered.

02:23.440 --> 02:25.670
So, we're really going to do this,
then, are we?

02:26.520 --> 02:28.636
Put ourselves up for adoption?

02:28.720 --> 02:31.154
I hadn't quite thought of it like that.

02:31.240 --> 02:33.515
Well, let's just hope some kid'll have us.

02:34.560 --> 02:37.279
Hello! Hi, Georgina. Hi, Lewis. Come on in.

02:37.360 --> 02:41.148
Come on, James, the children are through
there. Go on. They're dying to meet you.

02:41.240 --> 02:42.832
Georgina, I hope you don't mind,

02:42.920 --> 02:45.912
but loads of people wanted to come
when they found out about James.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.956
No, not at all. The more the merrier.

02:48.040 --> 02:50.998
I thought it was going to be difficult
when we moved to meet people,

02:51.080 --> 02:53.310
but James is proving to be quite a hit.

02:53.400 --> 02:56.437
Apparently, the sooner they get chickenpox
the better, so...

02:56.520 --> 02:59.990
Let me introduce you to my husband.
David? David, this is Georgina and Lewis.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.355
Hello, welcome. Can I get you a drink?

03:02.440 --> 03:04.396
What are you doing?

03:04.480 --> 03:06.471
An Internet search on adoption.

03:06.560 --> 03:09.279
Looks like the Philippines
might be our cheapest bet.

03:09.360 --> 03:11.874
Adam, we are not getting a child off
the Internet!

03:11.960 --> 03:13.916
That was a joke-type thing there.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.310
I haven't found anything in Britain.
I might have to make it more specific.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.356
Why don't you just look in the phone book?

03:19.440 --> 03:22.557
Rachel, I don't think you're gonna find
anything in the Yellow Pages.

03:22.640 --> 03:23.595
Thanks.

03:23.680 --> 03:25.989
What are you going to look
under? ''Children''?

03:26.080 --> 03:28.036
Adoption.
- Uh-huh.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.838
Here we go.

03:29.920 --> 03:31.512
There are quite a lot in here.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.113
God!

03:33.200 --> 03:36.510
Right, well, we'd better start ringing
round them tomorrow.

03:36.600 --> 03:39.194
Well, you can skive off work better
than I can, so you do it.

03:39.280 --> 03:40.793
You know, I hate it when you do that.

03:40.880 --> 03:43.394
What happens
the next time we need an aardvark trainer?

03:55.520 --> 03:58.398
Georgina, sure you won't have a drink?
- No, really.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.675
Karen, can I go to my dance class?

04:00.760 --> 04:02.876
Of course you can. Thanks, Ramona.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.394
OK. See you.
- Bye-bye.

04:05.480 --> 04:08.278
That's our nanny.
- You're very lucky.

04:08.360 --> 04:11.113
I didn't think that
when my husband tried to shag her.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.395
I'm only joking.

04:13.480 --> 04:15.994
No, we are actually very lucky with Ramona.

04:16.079 --> 04:19.072
You are lucky.
Ours refused to move up from London with us.

04:19.160 --> 04:21.355
Reckoned
Manchester wouldn't be lively enough.

04:21.440 --> 04:24.557
Which given the fact that she was from
Austria seemed a bit of a cheek.

04:24.640 --> 04:25.595
Sorry.

04:25.680 --> 04:29.832
I've had details from lots of agencies,
but the standard of English, it's shocking.

04:29.920 --> 04:34.630
Ramona's is pretty dodgy, but the children
love her, and she's utterly dependable, so...

04:34.720 --> 04:37.029
Do you mind me asking how much you pay her?

04:51.360 --> 04:53.316
Hi.
- Hello.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.356
I er... I saw you dance.

04:55.440 --> 04:58.318
I no see you dance.
- No, I don't.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.595
Ah, you are English.
- You're very good.

05:00.680 --> 05:01.829
I am Spanish.

05:01.920 --> 05:05.674
Ah! Have you ever thought
about turning professional?

05:05.760 --> 05:06.875
Professional?

05:06.960 --> 05:09.030
You know, like a job. Earning money from it.

05:09.120 --> 05:12.351
I know what he means, but no, no, I never.

05:12.440 --> 05:15.318
Well, I own a club.
Always on the lookout for dancers.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.868
Best ones can earn 100 quid a night.

05:17.960 --> 05:20.110
What, and you pay them this for dancing?
- Yeah.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.794
All very tasteful. Are you interested?

05:22.880 --> 05:24.836
Maybe.

05:24.920 --> 05:27.434
Well, think about it. Give me a call.

05:27.520 --> 05:31.069
If you're interested, I could start you
on a couple of nights a week.

05:31.160 --> 05:34.436
That's a lot of your Spanish pesetas.

05:34.520 --> 05:37.318
That's a lot of your English quids.

05:41.560 --> 05:45.109
Hey, it's been a while
since we had a night in together.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.760
So, watch telly if you want.

05:47.840 --> 05:51.469
Well, why would I want to do that
when we can...enjoy each other?

05:53.840 --> 05:56.593
I want to get an early night, Pete. Come on.

05:56.680 --> 05:59.353
Look, I do understand.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.716
You know, why you're tired.

06:02.800 --> 06:04.916
You know. You're still probably very upset.

06:06.320 --> 06:08.038
I'm fine.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.997
Yeah, of course you are!
- I am fine.

06:10.080 --> 06:12.878
It's over and done with, isn't it?

06:12.960 --> 06:16.077
That's just your way of dealing with it,
you know.

06:16.160 --> 06:19.038
You've still got the time to grieve.
You're still in mourning.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.473
Shut up, Pete.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.516
Go to sleep.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.556
Right.

06:24.640 --> 06:26.596
Good night.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.156
<i>For God's sake, what do you want?</i>

06:30.240 --> 06:32.515
<i>Nothing! That way I won't be disappointed.</i>

06:32.600 --> 06:33.828
<i>I'll do anything.</i>

06:33.920 --> 06:37.356
You already did it, David!
- One mistake, one mistake!

06:37.440 --> 06:40.398
Joshy, what are you doing up?

06:40.480 --> 06:43.313
Why are Mummy and Daddy always fighting?

06:43.400 --> 06:45.356
Oh, Joshy, they're not fighting.

06:45.440 --> 06:48.910
They're just having a little bit of
an argument, that's all.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.673
Come on, let's get you upstairs. Come on.

06:53.360 --> 06:54.998
Yeah...

06:55.080 --> 06:56.513
Yeah. Well, no.

06:56.600 --> 06:59.194
I've signed up for an introduction evening.

06:59.280 --> 07:02.795
I don't know. An introduction, I suppose.

07:02.880 --> 07:06.270
Hey, Rachel, you know, the first step, eh?

07:06.360 --> 07:08.316
Yeah.

07:08.400 --> 07:11.073
OK. OK, I'll see you later.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.956
Love you. Bye.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.716
<i>Come on, you must be seeing things.</i>

07:35.800 --> 07:40.157
Don't you think it strange that on the very day
we make enquiries about starting a family,

07:40.240 --> 07:42.310
I see the girl I first fell in love
with on a tram.

07:42.400 --> 07:46.313
What? Strange that you saw her on a tram?
- Strange I see her at all. She lives in Ireland!

07:46.400 --> 07:49.153
Yeah. Have you been drinking?
- No.

07:49.240 --> 07:50.912
Do you know what I reckon?

07:51.000 --> 07:54.117
What? That you're a little unsure
about this whole adoption thing?

07:56.400 --> 07:57.719
Yeah.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.916
Look, I don't blame you.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.913
Look, fatherhood, it's a big step,
and I think you're scared shitless.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.839
You don't think it's anything to
worry about, then?

08:07.920 --> 08:10.275
Er... Hallucinating when sober? Nah.

08:11.320 --> 08:12.992
Yeah, I'd worry.

08:32.760 --> 08:34.078
I knew it.

08:34.159 --> 08:37.152
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.
I knew I wasn't making it up.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.394
Hold on...

08:39.480 --> 08:42.198
You saw Jane for all of five minutes
when you were plastered.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.998
You can't remember what she looks like.

08:44.080 --> 08:46.514
Well, I didn't get a clear view,
I must admit,

08:46.600 --> 08:48.238
but I deflnitely saw her from behind.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.673
Are you winding me up?

08:49.760 --> 08:52.149
Look, I tell you, I saw her.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.515
Unless I'm nervous
about you becoming a father...

08:55.560 --> 08:56.709
I've got to go.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.119
What's Pete got to say?

08:58.200 --> 08:59.679
Oh, nothing. Banter.

08:59.760 --> 09:01.716
OK, all set?
- Yeah.

09:12.640 --> 09:14.039
Jane!

09:14.120 --> 09:16.554
Oh, my God, this is amazing!

09:16.640 --> 09:18.631
Yeah, what are you doing here?

09:20.320 --> 09:23.312
Oh, sorry. Hi, I'm Jane, a friend of
Adam's from Ireland.

09:23.400 --> 09:25.516
Yeah, we, uh, grew up together, you know.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.556
A long time ago.

09:27.640 --> 09:29.596
I'm Rachel.
- My wife.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.636
You heard that I got married?

09:31.720 --> 09:34.029
Mm. Front-page news
at the Coleraine Chronicle.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.873
You could hear the sobbing for miles.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.916
Jane has a lively imagination.

09:39.960 --> 09:41.996
So, are you visiting, or...?

09:42.080 --> 09:44.036
No, I've got a job here. I've just started.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.759
God, I'm sorry. This is just unbelievable.

09:46.840 --> 09:49.070
Yes, it is, yeah, yeah. Well, great
to see you.

09:49.160 --> 09:50.479
Adam!

09:51.560 --> 09:53.516
Do you know anybody in Manchester?

09:53.600 --> 09:56.910
Oh, not a soul.
Well, except for your man here.

09:58.320 --> 10:00.276
Well, you must come to dinner.

10:00.360 --> 10:02.112
Er...yeah.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.792
Absolutely.

10:03.880 --> 10:05.836
That'd be lovely.

10:06.880 --> 10:09.952
Well, er...it was very nice to meet you.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.996
And you.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.715
So, tell me about Jane, then.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.552
Jane?

10:28.240 --> 10:30.879
Oh, come on, she's obviously
an ex-girlfriend.

10:30.960 --> 10:33.793
Is she? I mean, er... Why obviously?

10:33.880 --> 10:36.155
What, a nice-looking girl like that?

10:36.240 --> 10:38.196
You'd definitely have tried.

10:38.280 --> 10:40.077
So what was it?

10:40.160 --> 10:42.355
An adolescent crush?
- Yeah. Exactly.

10:42.440 --> 10:45.238
You know the thing -
she dumped me when my spots didn't clear up.

10:45.320 --> 10:47.709
Hers have.

10:55.680 --> 10:59.036
And you must be...Mr and Mrs Williams?

10:59.120 --> 11:01.190
Rachel Bradley.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.714
Oh, so you're...not married?

11:03.800 --> 11:06.394
Yes, we are.
- And to each other.

11:06.480 --> 11:08.516
I just didn't take his name.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.989
It doesn't matter either way.
Come in. Take a seat.

11:12.440 --> 11:15.238
Nice one, Rach.
- You know I don't use my married name.

11:15.320 --> 11:18.596
Just for once, couldn't you?
We're trying to make the right impression.

11:18.680 --> 11:21.148
Don't be ridiculous.
- I'm being ridiculous?

11:25.280 --> 11:28.989
No, I'm sorry, she's not in.
I think she out baby-sitting for friends.

11:29.080 --> 11:31.116
Oh, is David here?
- No. He should be.

11:31.200 --> 11:35.432
I'm sorry, would you like to come back later?
- No, that's good. It's you I wanted to talk to.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.476
Me?
- Mm.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.516
Oh. Well, come in.

11:42.120 --> 11:44.076
Right, David, come this way.

11:44.160 --> 11:46.116
Tell me, how did you get my name?

11:48.040 --> 11:49.996
Found it in the Yellow Pages.

11:51.040 --> 11:52.996
I'm not in the Yellow Pages.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.036
No, it was just a...joke.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.075
Oh.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.033
Sorry, just a bit nervous.

11:59.120 --> 12:01.918
I've never been to a shrink before.
- And you still haven't.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.675
I'm a therapist, a very different creature.
Sit down.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.316
You were saying.

12:14.160 --> 12:16.071
Well, I have a colleague Roger

12:16.160 --> 12:18.993
who last year was going through
something of a personal crisis,

12:19.080 --> 12:22.072
and I heard that he was seeing someone
he reckoned was a great help,

12:22.160 --> 12:26.073
and I plucked up courage,
and asked him who it was.

12:27.120 --> 12:29.236
Well, I'm glad I was of some help to him.

12:29.320 --> 12:31.311
Perhaps I can do the same for you.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.834
I hope not. He became a homosexual.

12:35.560 --> 12:37.516
Now, can I ask...?

12:37.600 --> 12:40.478
How many of you are hoping to adopt a baby?

12:43.120 --> 12:47.796
Right, well, I'm going to have to tell you now
you're more than likely to be disappointed.

12:49.440 --> 12:55.470
Each year in Britain only 200 babies
are put up for adoption.

12:55.560 --> 12:57.790
Maybe the Internet isn't such a bad idea.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.792
Joke, joke.

13:03.840 --> 13:05.796
So...

13:05.880 --> 13:08.758
What exactly do you expect to get
out of this?

13:10.400 --> 13:12.356
Er...

13:12.440 --> 13:14.396
If I'm honest, nothing.

13:14.480 --> 13:16.835
I don't have much time for therapy.

13:16.920 --> 13:20.799
I've tried everything. I'm scraping the bottom
of the barrel. You're the last resort.

13:20.880 --> 13:22.757
Thank you.

13:23.800 --> 13:26.030
All I want is to put things right
between us,

13:26.120 --> 13:29.999
but everything I try seems to
push her further away, and it's killing me.

13:34.720 --> 13:36.950
Oh, this is pointless. I might as well go.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.555
Well, if you want to, but you've
already paid.

13:40.640 --> 13:43.313
And you've still got...40 minutes left.

13:50.440 --> 13:53.398
That's why we tend to ask for
the money upfront.

13:53.480 --> 13:57.837
So, um...
Let's talk a little bit about your marriage.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.916
Well, look, have you tried him
at the office?

14:03.000 --> 14:06.834
Yeah, and they said David left already.
No, his mobile phone is not switched on.

14:06.920 --> 14:09.354
Well, he must be on his way home, then.

14:09.440 --> 14:11.396
But I have to go now.

14:11.480 --> 14:15.075
Well, you can't, Ramona.
I am baby-sitting for Pete and Jenny.

14:15.160 --> 14:17.116
Karen, this is my night off.

14:17.200 --> 14:18.997
I've made an arrangement.

14:19.080 --> 14:20.991
Well, you'll just have to change it.

14:21.080 --> 14:23.036
No!

14:23.120 --> 14:25.918
Ramona, I really don't like your tone.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.956
Karen, I can stay.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.911
Are you sure?

14:31.000 --> 14:34.754
Right, Ramona, give me ten minutes.
- Thank you.

14:34.840 --> 14:37.912
Honestly,
she is getting ruder and ruder, that girl.

14:42.240 --> 14:46.028
It's a bit flash, this.
Wouldn't a curry have done?

14:46.120 --> 14:48.509
Well, you know... We're celebrating.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.875
This way.
- Celebrating?

14:51.920 --> 14:53.876
Celebrating what?

14:53.960 --> 14:57.635
Er, well, you know the job
that I was offered last week,

14:57.720 --> 14:59.119
and I turned it down and that?

14:59.200 --> 15:01.156
Pete, it's still open.

15:01.240 --> 15:05.233
Oh, that's brilliant, Jen. It doesn't mean
you're gonna be home any later, does it?

15:05.320 --> 15:08.232
No, I've got a secretary and everything.
It's more money an' all.

15:08.320 --> 15:11.312
Bloody hell!
They don't throw a car in as well, do they?

15:12.400 --> 15:14.356
No...

15:14.440 --> 15:16.396
No-one drives in New York.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.036
Ta.

15:22.640 --> 15:24.596
That's the other thing, Pete.

15:25.640 --> 15:32.193
Just out of interest, who here
thinks it's OK to smack children?

15:38.600 --> 15:40.556
Well, it never did me any harm.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.596
So...

15:42.680 --> 15:47.037
you'd want to...smack a child you adopt?

15:47.120 --> 15:50.271
Well, no, no, I wouldn't want to,
but if it did them some good.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.036
I mean, unless it was against the law.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.877
It's not against the law, is it?

15:56.960 --> 15:58.916
Not yet, no.

16:00.400 --> 16:07.158
So, what if your child had been taken into
care as a result of physical abuse?

16:17.280 --> 16:19.236
Well, um...

16:20.280 --> 16:21.235
If that...

16:21.320 --> 16:23.595
If that was the case...

16:23.680 --> 16:25.671
Or, indeed, in any other case...

16:25.760 --> 16:27.716
um...

16:27.800 --> 16:31.156
No, no, I wouldn't want to smack my child.

16:33.560 --> 16:36.074
If this is why we came here
we may as well skip pudding.

16:36.160 --> 16:40.711
Can you at least think about it?
It's an amazing opportunity.

16:41.760 --> 16:44.593
Who for?
- All of us.

16:44.680 --> 16:46.272
It's not for me.

16:46.360 --> 16:48.078
I don't want to live in New York.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.435
So, what?
You're gonna stay stuck here, are you?

16:50.520 --> 16:53.318
Your only ambition is a loft conversion.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.038
I'm happy.
- What?

16:55.120 --> 16:57.076
I'm happy!
- I'm not.

16:59.160 --> 17:00.388
You were.

17:00.480 --> 17:02.675
A week ago.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.954
When you still thought you were pregnant.

17:08.359 --> 17:10.794
But...Pete...

17:10.880 --> 17:13.440
I'm not pregnant, am I?

17:18.680 --> 17:20.636
I want more out of my life, Pete.

17:24.200 --> 17:26.156
No.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.679
Fine. Let's go.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.192
Right.

17:39.280 --> 17:42.317
Well, thank you. Thank you very, very much.

17:43.680 --> 17:45.636
Yes, I can see what Roger meant.

17:45.720 --> 17:48.075
I really feel I've been
making some progress here.

17:48.160 --> 17:51.118
Yes, well, it's early days yet.
- Yes, yes, yes...

17:51.200 --> 17:53.270
But, you know, I can see, with your help,

17:53.360 --> 17:56.591
that I don't have to be in complete control
of every situation.

17:56.680 --> 17:58.238
In fact, I know I can't be.

17:58.320 --> 18:02.791
And just accepting that, I think, will go some
way towards improving my marriage.

18:02.880 --> 18:05.030
You do know your hour is up?

18:05.120 --> 18:07.236
Yeah. Look, um...

18:08.720 --> 18:11.234
..I want to pay for a month in advance.

18:18.440 --> 18:20.396
I'm going to bed.

18:25.960 --> 18:27.598
Hi.

18:28.640 --> 18:31.871
Hi. Who are you?
- I'm Jo, a friend of Karen's.

18:34.800 --> 18:36.756
And she's...
- Had to go home.

18:36.840 --> 18:38.910
I beg your pardon?
- Oh, it's all right.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.195
She told me what to do if Adam woke up.

18:41.280 --> 18:43.589
He didn't. I checked on him every
few minutes.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.511
He's a sweet little guy.

18:45.600 --> 18:47.556
Yeah. Yeah.

18:48.600 --> 18:51.114
Thanks very much.

18:52.160 --> 18:53.229
Right.

18:54.720 --> 18:56.676
Right, I'll be off.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.711
Leave your empties.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.756
It's fine.

19:15.560 --> 19:17.516
Hello, darling.

19:19.560 --> 19:21.039
Where have you been?

19:21.120 --> 19:24.237
That would be telling.
Let's just say it was very worthwhile.

19:24.320 --> 19:26.276
Well, I'm very pleased for you, David.

19:26.360 --> 19:31.229
Pity you were supposed to be looking after
the children. Thank you for ruining my evening.

19:37.880 --> 19:39.950
Hey, looking good, looking good.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.956
Here you are. Try that one, sweetheart.

19:43.040 --> 19:45.998
How's your costume? All right?
- It's too tight.

19:46.080 --> 19:48.753
Ah, well, not to worry.
You won't have it on for long anyway.

19:48.840 --> 19:51.354
What? I thought you said this place
was tasteful.

19:51.440 --> 19:55.115
It is. Oh, you're not gonna go
all feminist on me, are you?

19:56.160 --> 19:57.639
There you go.

19:57.720 --> 20:01.030
Listen, you. I show more than this on
the beach for free, OK?

20:01.120 --> 20:03.236
If they are stupid enough to pay...

20:03.320 --> 20:05.595
But the thong, he stay on.

20:05.680 --> 20:09.309
Nobody touch me, and if anybody
wank, I walk. OK?

20:17.800 --> 20:19.756
Oh, for goodness' sake!

20:19.840 --> 20:22.957
Josh,
will you please go and get ready for school?

20:24.760 --> 20:26.716
Go on, hurry up. I've asked you three times.

20:28.840 --> 20:30.114
You're late.

20:30.200 --> 20:31.792
I know. I'm sorry. I oversleep.

20:31.880 --> 20:36.396
It's OK for you to pitch up 15 minutes late this
morning, but you won't wait 15 minutes for me.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.630
I said I'm sorry.

20:38.720 --> 20:41.837
Yeah, well, I don't want your apology.
I want you here on time.

20:42.880 --> 20:46.111
And I could do without
all your Mediterranean moods as well.

20:47.960 --> 20:49.598
OK. That's it, Karen.

20:49.680 --> 20:54.595
For one, it was not 15 minutes last night.
It was one hour, and for two, I don't have to do it.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.636
And when I do you don't even thank me!

20:56.720 --> 21:00.599
You and David don't even see what's going on
round here any more. All you do is fighting.

21:00.680 --> 21:02.910
It's too much for me, Karen. I quit.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.912
Oh, yeah, right.
What are you going to do? Go back to Madrid?

21:07.280 --> 21:08.759
No.

21:08.840 --> 21:12.116
I'm going to serve out my notice.
It is two weeks, no?

21:12.200 --> 21:15.670
And then I'm going to
start my new job next door. OK?

21:20.760 --> 21:22.910
Right, let's hear it, then. Apology, please.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.399
What for?

21:24.480 --> 21:30.476
Abandoning my chid with some
chain-smoking, alcoholic Australian.

21:30.560 --> 21:33.916
Jo is completely reliable. - Yeah, well,
you're bloody well not, are you?

21:34.000 --> 21:35.831
What were you thinking of?

21:35.920 --> 21:40.471
Listen, I know you're under a lot of stress at the
moment, but I really think you're overreacting.

21:41.720 --> 21:43.676
Overreacting?

21:45.480 --> 21:50.395
Right, OK. Would you leave Josh with
a complete stranger?

21:50.480 --> 21:52.516
Jo's not a complete stranger.
She's a friend.

21:53.640 --> 21:54.868
But he doesn't know that.

21:54.960 --> 21:58.555
What if he woke up in the night,
and saw her looming over him

21:58.640 --> 22:01.279
looking like a man in drag
with all that slap on?

22:01.360 --> 22:05.399
Excuse me, but if there's one thing I know,
it's how to apply make-up.

22:05.480 --> 22:07.436
Yeah, right, with a trowel, love.

22:07.520 --> 22:11.308
While we're on the subject, I'm really not
taken with ''chain-smoking alcoholic''.

22:11.400 --> 22:13.231
Australian wasn't meant as a compliment.

22:13.320 --> 22:16.039
Hey, listen, please, this is really
unnecessary.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.439
No, you're right.

22:17.520 --> 22:21.513
Because, Karen, you're the one
that I'm bloody well angry with.

22:21.600 --> 22:25.388
I would not have left Adam with Jo unless
I was completely confident of her ability.

22:25.480 --> 22:29.189
She used to work as a nanny.
- Actually, it was chalet girl.

22:29.280 --> 22:32.829
Was it? - Yeah. It's just a lot of
the clients acted like kids.

22:32.920 --> 22:37.516
This is not funny. This is my little boy
that we're talking about.

22:37.600 --> 22:40.068
This is my little boy! How is it funny?

22:42.960 --> 22:44.916
<i>I just wish you'd reconsider.</i>

22:46.120 --> 22:49.908
I mean, if it's money then I'm sure
we can come to some arrangement.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.434
David, it's not about the money.

22:52.520 --> 22:54.476
It's just time I want to go.

22:55.720 --> 22:57.676
Well, we wish you wouldn't.

23:00.120 --> 23:04.511
Josh will miss you desperately.
- Please, David, not to mention Joshy, OK?

23:04.600 --> 23:06.511
And the girls.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.788
David, I want to see them,
but I just no can live here no more.

23:12.880 --> 23:15.394
I know things aren't easy at the moment.

23:15.480 --> 23:17.835
But I don't think that will last.

23:20.360 --> 23:23.352
Let's just say
that someone is giving me some help

23:23.440 --> 23:25.715
which I think will make things better.

23:25.800 --> 23:28.075
But I don't think you are the problem
It's her.

23:29.160 --> 23:30.912
Karen hasn't been very happy lately.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.276
She's making everybody unhappy,
and all the time drinking, drinking!

23:34.360 --> 23:38.512
Yes, well, she does enjoy a glass
or two, but...

23:38.600 --> 23:41.558
Please, just...just give her a little time.

23:41.640 --> 23:43.312
No!

23:52.320 --> 23:54.276
Hey. Hello.

23:54.360 --> 23:56.510
Hello, tiger. Are you all right? Yeah?

23:56.600 --> 23:59.876
Are you drawing? Good boy.

24:01.600 --> 24:03.556
I spoke to my boss again.

24:05.600 --> 24:07.556
Yeah? What did he say?

24:09.720 --> 24:11.676
That job...

24:11.760 --> 24:15.116
That job is everything
I've ever dreamed of, Pete.

24:16.360 --> 24:18.351
We've been through this before.

24:20.520 --> 24:22.954
OK, love, come on. You can finish
that up later.

24:23.040 --> 24:26.157
Come on. You can watch that video.

24:26.240 --> 24:30.756
You're a lucky devil, aren't you? Go on.
The tape's in there. Good boy.

24:32.920 --> 24:34.751
Pete...

24:34.840 --> 24:38.230
Look, you've made it clear
how you feel about this,

24:38.320 --> 24:42.518
and to be honest, I thought that would be
enough to change my mind, but it isn't.

24:44.160 --> 24:46.116
I know you won't come with me,

24:46.200 --> 24:48.589
but I'm going to go anyway.

24:50.200 --> 24:53.670
He wants me in New York
by the end of the month, all right?

24:58.320 --> 25:00.276
Hi, honey, I'm home.

25:02.400 --> 25:04.789
I rang the adoption agency...

25:04.880 --> 25:08.475
Holy Jesus! Look, Jane, I don't think
this is a good idea.

25:08.560 --> 25:11.393
Rachel doesn't know about
how close we used to be, or the stag do.

25:11.480 --> 25:13.710
Especially the stag do.
- What?

25:13.800 --> 25:15.756
What?

25:15.840 --> 25:18.354
OK, fine. Yeah, fine.

25:18.440 --> 25:20.396
Right. Bye.

25:21.880 --> 25:24.678
Hi.
- My mother. She says hello, by the way.

25:24.760 --> 25:27.194
Did you manage
to contact the adoption agency?

25:27.280 --> 25:29.669
They're sending someone to see us.
- Fantastic.

25:30.720 --> 25:33.757
Oh, and by the way,
I invited Jane round to dinner.

25:33.840 --> 25:35.159
So I see.

25:37.760 --> 25:39.796
Really, I don't think we should
see each other.

25:39.880 --> 25:42.474
It's OK. I'm fine about it.
- But what if Rachel finds out?

25:42.560 --> 25:45.074
What, like if you say the wrong thing,
or if I do?

25:45.160 --> 25:46.309
Found it.

25:46.400 --> 25:49.392
Listen, you should not leave us
in a room together alone.

25:49.480 --> 25:51.436
We're already talking about the old days.

25:51.520 --> 25:56.640
Hey, do you remember that bench
at the Causeway? What you carved onto it?

25:56.720 --> 25:58.995
''Adam Williams 4 Jane Fitzpatrick.
True love.''

25:59.080 --> 26:01.594
''Adam Loves Man U.''

26:01.680 --> 26:04.433
Got him into terrible trouble.
Portrush is only a small town.

26:04.520 --> 26:06.829
There weren't many United supporters
called Adam.

26:06.920 --> 26:08.876
Ha, ha, you daft bollocks.

26:10.440 --> 26:12.078
You've done well.

26:12.160 --> 26:13.991
She seems really nice.

26:15.040 --> 26:16.189
She is really nice.

26:16.280 --> 26:17.793
<i>Is Adam in?</i>

26:17.880 --> 26:20.633
<i>Yeah, he's in the kitchen.
- Oh, God.</i>

26:20.720 --> 26:21.914
We need to talk.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.197
Pete, this is Jane Fitzpatrick.
You don't know her.

26:25.280 --> 26:28.158
She's an old friend from Ireland.

26:28.240 --> 26:29.958
I haven't seen her for eight years.

26:30.040 --> 26:33.589
She just started a new job in Manchester.
We met by chance. She came for dinner.

26:33.680 --> 26:37.036
He's not going to remember all that, Adam.
- I think I might.

26:37.120 --> 26:38.838
Hello. Pete, was it?

26:38.920 --> 26:40.273
Yeah.

26:40.360 --> 26:42.032
Look, we need to go for a drink.

26:42.920 --> 26:45.992
She is not leaving you. - If she takes
that job, it's the same thing.

26:46.080 --> 26:47.877
Unless you go with her.

26:47.960 --> 26:51.032
I don't want to.
She's putting that job above our marriage.

26:51.120 --> 26:53.076
I can't believe that.

26:53.160 --> 26:57.039
I mean, it doesn't matter how good
a job is - your marriage comes first.

26:58.160 --> 27:01.391
<i>Yeah, but I don't think
it is that good a marriage.</i>

27:03.640 --> 27:05.596
Not since they got back together.

27:06.640 --> 27:08.596
I think they've been making do.

27:08.680 --> 27:11.592
Well, I didn't like her much, but
I can sympathise.

27:11.680 --> 27:14.831
I mean, if it was him who'd been offered
a good job somewhere else,

27:14.920 --> 27:18.151
she'd be expected just to pack up and go,
no questions asked.

27:18.240 --> 27:21.516
The thing is, it wouldn't be so bad
if it was just the two of them.

27:22.360 --> 27:24.316
What's gonna happen about little Adam?

27:24.400 --> 27:27.551
<i>Jenny's mind's made up.
She's determined to take him with her.</i>

27:28.640 --> 27:30.756
He's determined not to give him up.

27:32.400 --> 27:37.110
I just hope it doesn't get nasty, you know,
with lawyers getting involved and all that.

27:37.200 --> 27:39.555
Of course I don't want it to get nasty.

27:39.640 --> 27:42.473
Do you think he's just going to let you
swan off to America?

27:42.560 --> 27:45.313
He's going to fight for custody
and frankly I don't blame him.

27:45.400 --> 27:49.359
Then I won't go, will I, if it comes to that.
I won't go, but I'm still going to leave him.

27:49.440 --> 27:52.273
Why? - What do you mean, why?
My marriage is over.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.156
Look, I'm sorry. I'm...

27:55.240 --> 27:59.631
Come on, I'm so sorry
that I'm hurting the man I grew up with,

27:59.720 --> 28:02.712
and I'm sorry that I'm disappointing
everybody,

28:02.800 --> 28:04.916
and I'm sorry that I've been so unhappy,

28:05.000 --> 28:09.516
but I mean, what do you think...what do you think
makes somebody leave their whole life behind?

28:09.600 --> 28:14.469
<i>I mean, I've told Pete it's over,
and he refuses to accept it.</i>

28:15.680 --> 28:18.240
But... But I am leaving him, no matter what.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.235
It's over.

28:20.320 --> 28:22.276
Even if I don't go to New York...

28:23.600 --> 28:24.953
<i>...I'm leaving him.</i>

28:30.120 --> 28:33.590
And with the current state of sterling
vis-a-vis the euro,

28:33.680 --> 28:37.958
it does make sound financial sense
to centralise your requirements

28:38.040 --> 28:40.998
in terms of management consultancy
here in Britain.

28:41.080 --> 28:43.799
<i>David, I just have one question.</i>

28:43.880 --> 28:45.632
Where are the gentlemen?

28:46.720 --> 28:48.233
Er...

28:48.320 --> 28:50.914
Oh, the Gents? Er, through the back there.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.279
I think it's going rather well.

28:57.360 --> 29:00.193
So long as he understands
a word you're saying.

29:00.280 --> 29:03.829
So, tell me, did you get in touch
with that therapist I recommended?

29:03.920 --> 29:05.592
Hm?

29:05.680 --> 29:07.636
Oh, er, no.

29:10.200 --> 29:11.952
Yes.

29:12.040 --> 29:13.632
Sorry, yes, I did.

29:13.720 --> 29:16.632
Any joy? - We've only seen each other
a couple of times.

29:16.720 --> 29:20.269
Today we had something of a breakthrough.

29:20.360 --> 29:23.750
Why is it so important
for you to please your father?

29:23.840 --> 29:27.879
I suppose it's because
I've always looked up to him.

29:27.960 --> 29:29.916
He led a blameless life.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.355
Blameless?
- Yes.

29:32.440 --> 29:34.396
I think so.

29:37.400 --> 29:40.676
Though I remember when we were on holiday.

29:40.760 --> 29:42.671
<i>Come on, David.</i>

29:42.760 --> 29:45.228
Can Auntie Pauline come to
the beach as well?

29:45.320 --> 29:48.278
<i>She said she wanted to lie down,
but we'll see.</i>

29:48.360 --> 29:51.352
Auntie Pauline! Auntie Pauline!

29:52.760 --> 29:54.193
<i>Daddy!</i>

29:55.240 --> 30:01.475
<i>Auntie Pauline! We're going to the beach. You'll
help us build sandcastles, won't you, Daddy?</i>

30:01.560 --> 30:03.516
<i>Mummy said you would.</i>

30:06.480 --> 30:08.948
My God, the sins of the father.

30:09.040 --> 30:11.918
Yes, well, it doesn't excuse my behaviour,
though.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.834
No. It might help you
to stop beating yourself up about it.

30:15.920 --> 30:18.832
You've got to forgive yourself, David,

30:18.920 --> 30:21.115
before you can expect your wife to.

30:21.200 --> 30:25.671
Yes, well, frankly, Rog, I'd rather spend 40 pounds
an hour for his advice, thank you.

30:29.600 --> 30:32.558
Right, let's wrap this one up,
and dump him back at the hotel.

30:34.680 --> 30:37.956
Gentlemen, so we go on drinking somewhere?

30:44.160 --> 30:47.516
This isn't really my kind of place.
- Do you think it's mine?

30:51.280 --> 30:54.750
Ugh! I don't think much
of their bloody expensive wine either.

30:54.840 --> 30:57.274
Still, Helmut seems to be enjoying himself.

31:06.040 --> 31:06.790
David!

31:08.880 --> 31:10.677
Ramona!

31:13.440 --> 31:15.795
David! You dog.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.916
No, thank you.

31:27.760 --> 31:29.716
Yeah, OK.

31:31.360 --> 31:33.669
Have you rung Pete?
- No, not yet.

31:36.480 --> 31:40.075
I'm seeing him after work tomorrow.
Not that I'm looking forward to it.

31:40.160 --> 31:42.958
What are you doing?
- I'm untidying the place.

31:44.560 --> 31:48.109
I just tidied it!
- I thought I didn't recognise it.

31:48.200 --> 31:51.510
Adam, she is not a photographer
from Homes and Gardens.

31:51.600 --> 31:54.478
No, she's a social worker
with our destiny in her hands.

31:54.560 --> 31:56.915
Look...

31:57.000 --> 31:59.753
Listen, I'm as nervous as you are,

31:59.840 --> 32:03.469
but we've got months
of assessment ahead of us.

32:03.560 --> 32:06.518
Sooner or later,
she's going to find out the truth about us.

32:06.600 --> 32:08.556
What, that we're messy?
- Yeah.

32:08.640 --> 32:10.312
Do they let messy people adopt?

32:10.400 --> 32:13.233
I don't know,
but would you rather it was spotless?

32:14.280 --> 32:18.159
I don't know anybody who lives like that, Adam,
apart from psychopaths and my mother.

32:18.240 --> 32:20.196
Your mother?

32:20.280 --> 32:22.475
Oh, my God! Up. Up. Get off.

32:25.760 --> 32:27.034
Adam!

32:31.320 --> 32:33.276
Just...be yourself.

32:33.360 --> 32:37.592
Let's hope that your performance at the
information evening hasn't ruined our chances.

32:37.680 --> 32:41.468
That won't have mattered. Different
departments, different people. Come on.

32:43.520 --> 32:44.919
Hello.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.310
Ruth Wylie. We met the other night.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.156
Come in.

32:56.840 --> 32:58.592
Come on, then.

32:58.680 --> 33:00.636
So, um...

33:00.720 --> 33:02.756
<i>what's your social worker like, then?</i>

33:03.800 --> 33:05.791
She's fine. She's nice.

33:05.880 --> 33:08.917
Of course Adam thinks
that's a ploy to catch us out.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.956
Oh, yeah, right.

33:12.320 --> 33:14.515
To be honest,
I don't really know much about her.

33:14.600 --> 33:18.149
I asked her if she had children of her own,
and she wasn't very keen to tell us.

33:18.240 --> 33:22.392
Yeah, well, I suppose they have to
keep a professional distance, don't they?

33:22.480 --> 33:24.835
Particularly if they're going to
turn us down.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.558
<i>So, how did you get on?</i>

33:26.640 --> 33:28.551
Nice home.
- Do you think so? Good.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.556
I mean, thanks.

33:32.680 --> 33:33.635
So...

33:33.720 --> 33:35.915
Would you like coffee?
We've not offered you any.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.037
Would you like some coffee?
- Or tea. We've got loads of teas.

33:39.120 --> 33:42.396
Loads of them. Hundreds.
- Really, I'm fine. Thank you.

33:42.480 --> 33:43.435
Yeah...

33:43.520 --> 33:50.312
Have you given any more thought to what sort
of child or children you might be interested in?

33:51.360 --> 33:54.591
Not really.
- There's plenty of time.

33:54.680 --> 33:56.591
We've gone off babies.

33:56.680 --> 34:01.754
Well, not exactly gone off.
We've just...ruled them out.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.796
And spanking. Ruled out spanking.

34:03.880 --> 34:06.394
It's quite difficult
to get your head round everything.

34:06.480 --> 34:08.516
Yes.

34:08.600 --> 34:13.150
Well, maybe this will make it
a little bit more real.

34:13.239 --> 34:16.516
It's adverts of children
who are available for adoption.

34:16.600 --> 34:17.748
<i>Really?</i>

34:17.840 --> 34:22.118
Like estate agents' details? You know -
''Room for improvement. Must be seen.''

34:23.440 --> 34:24.839
Something like that.

34:35.360 --> 34:38.237
<i>God, Karen,
It's enough to break your heart, I tell you.</i>

34:38.320 --> 34:40.594
Who knows what horrors they've seen?

34:41.639 --> 34:42.629
Yeah.

34:42.719 --> 34:45.074
You want to take them all.

34:45.159 --> 34:48.914
You know, you want to make them all
feel safe and wanted.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.956
But you can't.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.389
The worst thing is,
they might not let us take any of them.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.638
<i>I want you out of the house now.</i>

34:58.720 --> 35:00.472
Oh, for God's sake, man.

35:02.760 --> 35:05.752
I don't want to stay here.
- It's a question of morals.

35:05.840 --> 35:07.876
That's the kettle throwing sticks
at the pot!

35:07.960 --> 35:10.758
What is going on?
- Ramona will not be serving out her notice.

35:10.840 --> 35:11.795
What?

35:11.880 --> 35:14.713
We decided it'd be best
if we make a clean break. She leaves now.

35:14.800 --> 35:16.756
I go to kiss goodbye to Josh.

35:17.920 --> 35:20.036
Ramona!
- Don't upset him, please.

35:21.080 --> 35:23.071
Oh, well, that is bloody great, that is.

35:23.160 --> 35:26.516
I take it you'll be looking after
the children until we find a replacement.

35:35.560 --> 35:38.120
Thought you'd gone out.

35:38.200 --> 35:40.350
I was just looking at our son.

35:40.440 --> 35:42.556
Wondering how I'd get on without him.

35:45.040 --> 35:48.032
You'll see him on weekends, Pete. Come on.

35:48.120 --> 35:50.554
Not halfway across the world I won't.

35:55.080 --> 35:56.877
Look, Jen, I love you.

35:56.960 --> 35:58.916
Look, don't worry.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.833
This is just my way of trying to explain.

36:02.880 --> 36:03.869
OK?

36:05.640 --> 36:09.030
What was the thing
that first attracted me to you?

36:11.600 --> 36:14.637
I let you feel my tits under my bra.

36:16.080 --> 36:18.275
Yeah, there was that, yeah, yeah.

36:19.840 --> 36:22.912
It was... You had balls.

36:23.000 --> 36:27.391
You had an edge. You never wanted
to compromise, and you've never lost that.

36:27.480 --> 36:32.838
But, to be honest, I can't see you being
happy living down the road.

36:36.720 --> 36:39.359
I am leaving you, Pete.

36:42.440 --> 36:45.910
I just want us both to be happy.
I know it sounds selfish.

36:47.200 --> 36:49.589
But I don't want us to end up
hating each other.

36:49.680 --> 36:53.468
I want... I want a happy divorce.

36:53.560 --> 36:57.473
You know, maybe one day
we'll end up going to Adam's graduation,

36:57.560 --> 36:59.551
somethlng like that.

36:59.640 --> 37:01.596
<i>Blimey.</i>

37:01.680 --> 37:05.229
Do you think he's going to go to university,
then, do you?

37:06.720 --> 37:08.995
What, with your brains, and your looks?

37:12.400 --> 37:16.234
Look, of course I'll miss him,
but I think this is for the best.

37:18.240 --> 37:20.754
You'll bring him home for his holidays.

37:20.840 --> 37:23.752
Or when he's older, you know,
he can come on his own.

37:23.840 --> 37:29.915
Look, better still, I can come over
for...for Christmas and birthdays.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.151
I mean, New York's not that far away, is it?

37:33.240 --> 37:35.196
It's only seven hours.

37:37.080 --> 37:39.036
Yeah, seven hours.

37:51.360 --> 37:53.316
I'll get it.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.791
Josh, no. You're having lunch in a minute.

37:56.880 --> 38:00.077
Ah, come here to me. You can have them.
Come on. Come on.

38:01.120 --> 38:03.475
Oh! Ah, look, there she is!

38:04.520 --> 38:06.272
The guest of honour.

38:06.360 --> 38:08.316
Are you all sorted, Jen?

38:10.760 --> 38:12.796
So...champagne?

38:12.880 --> 38:16.270
I probably shouldn't.
You know, the flight and er...

38:17.360 --> 38:19.316
Go on, just a drop.

38:22.680 --> 38:24.796
You all right?

38:24.880 --> 38:29.954
We're sharing this flat - apartment -
with this woman from the office,

38:30.040 --> 38:33.555
which is good, cos she's got a little
one Adam's sort of age.

38:33.640 --> 38:36.393
And I got a place in nursery.
- Kindergarten.

38:36.480 --> 38:39.836
Do they look done to you?
- Have you switched the oven on?

38:39.920 --> 38:41.433
Oh, shit!

38:41.520 --> 38:43.476
What time's your plane?
- Three.

38:43.560 --> 38:45.516
I'll get it!

38:47.080 --> 38:48.718
Sorry.

38:50.920 --> 38:54.549
I've checked, you know. There's a cable
station that shows all United's games.

38:54.640 --> 38:56.756
And I can tape them,
and send them over to him.

38:56.840 --> 38:58.319
Adam, look who's here.

39:01.040 --> 39:02.996
Hi.
- Hello.

39:04.040 --> 39:08.750
Hello. Haven't we met before?
- Er...no. No, I don't think so.

39:08.840 --> 39:12.071
Surely, you're...
- Mistaken. This is Jane Fitzpatrick.

39:12.160 --> 39:15.197
We used to spend the summers together
in Ireland when I was younger.

39:15.280 --> 39:17.396
You wouldn't...know her.

39:17.480 --> 39:22.679
Jane, this is David. Oh, actually, I was going
to have a word with you about something.

39:22.760 --> 39:25.558
Now's a good time. Here.

39:25.640 --> 39:28.950
Pete, you get the girls a drink, will you?

39:29.040 --> 39:30.393
All right, love?

39:31.280 --> 39:32.633
Bit of champagne?

39:32.720 --> 39:36.395
I'm sorry. I'm sorry about laying
into you the other night.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.396
No, Jen. I'm sorry.

39:39.480 --> 39:41.436
It was me. I just wasn't thinking.

39:43.640 --> 39:46.074
So, are we friends again, then?
- Yeah.

39:47.120 --> 39:49.076
Thank God for that.

39:51.240 --> 39:53.196
I just don't know what's wrong with me.

39:53.280 --> 39:57.910
I'm just so angry with everybody.
The twins, Ramona, David...

39:58.960 --> 40:03.636
Oh... Can I, um...say something
that might piss you off again?

40:03.720 --> 40:07.269
Well, I'll tell you now, it is a risk.

40:07.360 --> 40:11.239
Oh, well, sod it.
There'll be a bloody great ocean between us.

40:12.400 --> 40:14.960
You and David, you're different to
Pete and me, you know.

40:15.040 --> 40:18.271
You can make it work if you want to.

40:18.360 --> 40:23.912
Think about forgiving him.
God, what do I know? But...think about it.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.310
Sorry. Come on, love, I think it's
time we made a move.

40:27.400 --> 40:28.879
OK.

40:30.320 --> 40:33.039
God. I can't believe you're really going.

40:35.720 --> 40:37.073
All set, mate?

40:37.160 --> 40:40.789
You will write, won't you?
- Yeah.

40:40.880 --> 40:42.950
I will. I promise.

40:43.040 --> 40:44.758
I will.

40:44.840 --> 40:46.592
You'll email, won't you, David?

40:46.680 --> 40:48.636
My secretary will. Good luck.

40:51.960 --> 40:53.393
Go for it, Jen.

40:54.840 --> 40:56.193
Bye.

40:56.280 --> 40:58.475
Bye.
- Have fun, yeah?

41:02.720 --> 41:04.950
Put your seat belt on.

41:09.560 --> 41:12.358
Miss you.
- Bye, Jen.

41:16.400 --> 41:18.914
Bye!
- Bye.

41:26.840 --> 41:27.795
Well...

41:27.880 --> 41:29.074
Ramona!

41:30.160 --> 41:32.754
Seat belt!
- Karen, stop the car, will you?

41:38.560 --> 41:40.516
Ramona.
- David.

41:42.280 --> 41:44.236
How's things?
- Good, thank you.

41:44.320 --> 41:46.231
They're very nice people.

41:46.320 --> 41:49.278
I... I wanted to apologise.

41:50.360 --> 41:53.397
I think in the past I've been a bit too
quick to rush to judgement.

41:53.480 --> 41:56.438
David, you know that I always
look after the children.

41:56.520 --> 41:59.671
Um... I've been doing a lot of analy...

41:59.760 --> 42:02.752
a lot of...soul-searching lately,

42:02.840 --> 42:04.796
and...and it's good.

42:04.880 --> 42:07.713
I think it's bringing Karen and I
closer together,

42:07.800 --> 42:10.598
and we're well on the way
to putting our problems behind us.

42:10.680 --> 42:13.274
Good.

42:13.360 --> 42:15.316
I'm glad that you're happy.

42:18.640 --> 42:21.871
If um... if circumstances change,

42:21.960 --> 42:24.713
if for any reason you'd like to come back,

42:24.800 --> 42:27.997
then I promise you,
you'd be more than welcome.

42:29.080 --> 42:32.197
Tomorrow?
- What?

42:33.960 --> 42:36.110
They're no very nice people.
They're horrible.

42:36.200 --> 42:39.078
They make me eat by my own,
I'm not allowed to watch television,

42:39.160 --> 42:40.878
and after nine I have to go to my room!

42:40.960 --> 42:42.188
I hate it!

42:42.280 --> 42:44.999
Listen, I don't, you know, dance
any more, OK?

42:45.080 --> 42:49.232
I just thought it was going to be fun,
but the men are just disgusting.

42:49.320 --> 42:51.276
You were OK, though.

42:53.600 --> 42:55.556
Tomorrow will be just fine.

42:57.480 --> 43:00.313
I'd love to go to New York.
Have you guys ever been?

43:00.400 --> 43:02.834
No, never.
- Full of Irishmen, isn't it?

43:02.920 --> 43:05.388
Oh, I'll get that.

43:06.440 --> 43:08.670
That'll be Pete. Forgotten where
the airport is.

43:08.760 --> 43:11.194
Tell him he's a fool.
I don't want to see him ever again.

43:11.280 --> 43:14.192
Eat one of those bloomin' sausage rolls.
- Here, you, open wide.

43:15.240 --> 43:17.595
Oh! Christ almighty! Oh, my God!

43:17.680 --> 43:19.750
No, spit. Spit it out.

43:21.040 --> 43:23.156
Oh, I'm so sorry. Are you all right?

43:30.840 --> 43:33.673
You know what a coincidence it was,
us bumping into each other?

43:33.760 --> 43:36.320
Yeah! Yeah.
- Well, it wasn't.

43:38.600 --> 43:41.672
Well, I think it was. You know -
a city of two and a half million people.

43:41.760 --> 43:45.639
What are the chances of that happening?
- No, I mean I contrived it.

43:48.320 --> 43:49.275
What?

43:49.360 --> 43:52.636
I wanted to see you again, Adam.
Your stag weekend got me thinking.

43:52.720 --> 43:55.029
Oh, no, no, no. It wasn't meant to do that.

43:55.120 --> 43:57.588
Well, I thought we were over each other.

43:57.680 --> 44:00.240
We were. We are.
- We're not.

44:00.320 --> 44:02.993
You unleashed some really strong feelings,
Adam.

44:04.080 --> 44:06.674
Well...leash them again.

44:09.160 --> 44:11.390
Haven't I tried?

44:11.480 --> 44:13.277
But what's meant to be...

44:13.360 --> 44:16.511
<i>Jane, you are staying for lunch, aren't you?</i>

44:16.600 --> 44:18.875
Er...no.

44:18.960 --> 44:20.916
No, no.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.992
In fact, I should be off, so um...

44:24.840 --> 44:26.193
..see you again soon.

44:26.280 --> 44:27.633
See you.

44:27.720 --> 44:29.676
Thanks.

44:37.440 --> 44:39.874
Great news!

44:39.960 --> 44:43.953
Ramona is coming back...tomorrow!

44:47.920 --> 44:50.309
It's all fixed.

44:50.400 --> 44:52.516
That's great, David.

44:54.840 --> 44:58.150
I think Josh is finally coming down
with chickenpox.

44:59.440 --> 45:01.351
You know, Karen...

45:01.440 --> 45:04.034
I feel really positive about the future.

45:04.120 --> 45:06.839
I've got this sense
that things are really on the way up,

45:06.920 --> 45:10.629
and that whatever happens is for the best.

45:10.720 --> 45:14.508
That's good, David, because um...
I've been doing some thinking as well,

45:14.600 --> 45:17.876
and I think it would be a very good idea
if you moved out.

45:31.200 --> 45:33.270
You'll look after him, won't you?

45:34.360 --> 45:37.477
Don't let him get a Yank accent.
- No, I will, I will.

45:37.560 --> 45:40.199
You will?
- I mean I'll...I'll look after him.

45:42.240 --> 45:46.199
OK. OK, tiger,
are you going to be a good boy for Mummy?

45:46.280 --> 45:49.192
Yeah? And I'll see you in a few weeks, yeah?
- Yeah.

45:49.280 --> 45:50.918
OK?

45:51.000 --> 45:54.515
OK.
- OK, come on. We're boarding, Pete. Right?

45:58.560 --> 46:00.516
Come here. OK?
- Yeah.

46:04.400 --> 46:07.233
Bye, Jen. Bye.
- Thanks, Pete.

46:07.320 --> 46:09.276
Come on. Come on, love.

46:27.960 --> 46:29.552
Oh!

46:29.640 --> 46:31.471
You forgot... You forgot the rabbit.
