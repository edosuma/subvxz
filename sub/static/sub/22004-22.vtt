WEBVTT

00:23.371 --> 00:24.546
Yeah, man.

00:24.589 --> 00:25.895
Bam.

00:28.419 --> 00:30.769
Oh, my. Another round, Loretta?

00:30.813 --> 00:33.163
Ah, not if it means you're
lifting a finger to get it.

00:33.207 --> 00:34.991
Just a finger, I promise.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.428
See, I like
this look on you, Dwayne.

00:37.472 --> 00:39.169
A man of leisure,

00:39.213 --> 00:41.302
hanging out with your
friend on a busy night,

00:41.345 --> 00:43.521
letting everyone else do the
heavy lifting.

00:43.565 --> 00:46.307
Well, I promised Laurel
that I'd take some downtime.

00:46.350 --> 00:48.570
She's under the impression
that I work too much.

00:48.613 --> 00:49.484
See, your daughter

00:49.527 --> 00:51.921
is wise beyond her years.

00:52.835 --> 00:54.750
Sebastian! What you drinking?

00:54.793 --> 00:56.578
I don't have time;
listen, we got a problem.

00:56.621 --> 00:58.493
Please don't tell me
this is about a case.

00:58.536 --> 00:59.581
No, it's about Pride. Look.

00:59.624 --> 01:01.844
This article dropped
20 minutes ago.

01:01.887 --> 01:05.500
"Vigilante Cop Abuses Power"?

01:05.543 --> 01:07.458
Yeah, it's not good, it rehashes
a bunch of your old cases.

01:07.502 --> 01:09.634
They even have a picture
of Carsen Donner in here.

01:09.678 --> 01:11.462
WADE:
The son of the arms dealer

01:11.506 --> 01:12.550
that kidnapped Danny?

01:12.594 --> 01:14.030
Yeah, well, they
left that part out.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.466
But they talk about how
you beat him for information.

01:15.510 --> 01:16.554
They talk about how you
kidnapped Mayor Hamilton

01:16.598 --> 01:17.816
last year, and a half a dozen

01:17.860 --> 01:19.818
other accusations.Well, now,

01:19.862 --> 01:22.212
this is ridiculous, it's taken
completely out of context.

01:22.256 --> 01:24.258
Yeah, well...

01:28.740 --> 01:30.438
...it may be out of context...

01:33.658 --> 01:35.921
It all happens to be true.

01:40.230 --> 01:43.146
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:43.190 --> 01:45.670
♪ Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:45.714 --> 01:48.282
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:48.325 --> 01:49.413
♪ How, how, how, how

01:49.457 --> 01:51.720
♪ Hey, hey

01:57.334 --> 01:59.119
♪ You gotta come on.

02:00.642 --> 02:03.427
Dwayne Pride acts
like some sort of superhero.

02:03.471 --> 02:05.603
Disregarding the law,
disregarding the people

02:05.647 --> 02:06.691
that get hurt along the way.

02:06.735 --> 02:08.693
He cannot go on unchecked.

02:08.737 --> 02:10.695
Tired of listening
to this crap.

02:10.739 --> 02:12.654
It's been on the local news
all morning.

02:12.697 --> 02:13.916
Who's Oliver Crane, anyway?

02:13.959 --> 02:16.310
He was a stringer
for the wire service,

02:16.353 --> 02:17.789
then he lost his
job, he started

02:17.833 --> 02:20.662
BreakingNOLA.com, trying
to get a national profile,

02:20.705 --> 02:23.186
you know, going after stories
the bigger media wouldn't touch.

02:23.230 --> 02:24.535
You sound like a fan.

02:24.579 --> 02:25.841
I kind of was, until this.

02:25.884 --> 02:27.190
Now I just want to smack
that smirk off his face.

02:27.234 --> 02:28.583
Just relax.

02:28.626 --> 02:29.584
This is all gonna blow over.

02:29.627 --> 02:30.846
Yeah, it's got to.

02:30.889 --> 02:33.370
People in this city know
who King really is.

02:33.414 --> 02:34.937
I mean, they're not
gonna buy into that.

02:34.980 --> 02:37.157
Have you talked
to any actual people, lately?

02:37.200 --> 02:38.723
Listen, what's important

02:38.767 --> 02:40.725
is to keep
a positive attitude for Pride.

02:40.769 --> 02:43.989
I appreciate the concern,
New York, but I'm all right.

02:44.033 --> 02:45.208
Course you are, King.

02:45.252 --> 02:46.818
You don't look all right.

02:46.862 --> 02:48.385
Huh?
What? I mean,

02:48.429 --> 02:49.604
you look-you look great.

02:49.647 --> 02:50.779
Obviously, it's just...

02:51.693 --> 02:52.737
I don't know,

02:52.781 --> 02:54.348
you look worried, too.

02:54.391 --> 02:55.653
Well, I am worried,
Sebastian, but not for myself.

02:55.697 --> 02:59.831
Spent the night going
through Crane's story.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.398
We got a big problem.

03:01.442 --> 03:02.747
Come on.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.621
PRIDE:
Photos of Carsen Donner

03:06.664 --> 03:09.885
probably came courtesy
of his father's lawyers.

03:09.928 --> 03:15.151
But the rest of this article,
he has details of a dozen cases

03:15.195 --> 03:19.590
I've handled over the years
for NCIS.

03:19.634 --> 03:21.549
Javier Garcia and the cartel,

03:21.592 --> 03:25.205
Broussards,
even a case I worked in Moscow,

03:25.248 --> 03:26.380
back in the day.

03:26.423 --> 03:27.685
Half of it

03:27.729 --> 03:29.731
is classified information.

03:29.774 --> 03:31.341
You think there's a leak?

03:31.385 --> 03:32.777
I don't know what else to think.

03:32.821 --> 03:34.083
It's got to be someone in NCIS.

03:34.126 --> 03:36.912
NCIS, Navy, DoD.

03:36.955 --> 03:39.697
Means names of witnesses
and informants were exposed.

03:39.741 --> 03:40.959
A lot of innocent people
could be in danger.

03:41.003 --> 03:42.613
Which is why we
have to figure out

03:42.657 --> 03:44.702
where the leak came from

03:44.746 --> 03:46.922
and contain it, fast.

03:46.965 --> 03:49.011
All right, so we go to Crane
and find out who his source is.

03:49.054 --> 03:50.795
SEBASTIAN: Yeah, well,
journalists don't give up
that information easily.

03:50.839 --> 03:52.928
I'll deal with Crane.
I need the rest of you

03:52.971 --> 03:54.712
to scour my old cases.

03:54.756 --> 03:56.279
Find the names
and locations

03:56.323 --> 03:57.976
of anyone who would've
been exposed

03:58.020 --> 03:59.543
and then warn them

03:59.587 --> 04:02.764
of potential danger.

04:04.679 --> 04:06.028
What?GREGORIO:
You really think

04:06.071 --> 04:07.638
you're the right person
to talk to Crane right now?

04:07.682 --> 04:09.858
Yeah, this guy's got it
out for you, King.

04:09.901 --> 04:11.729
I mean,
you showing up there

04:11.773 --> 04:13.253
would just add more fuel
to the fire.

04:13.296 --> 04:14.689
Especially if you confront him.

04:14.732 --> 04:16.604
I'm not confronting him,
Christopher.

04:16.647 --> 04:19.607
I'll just question him.SEBASTIAN: I doubt he's
gonna see it that way,

04:19.650 --> 04:20.999
when the-the cop
he just filleted

04:21.043 --> 04:22.131
on his Web site comes

04:22.174 --> 04:23.393
marching into
his office.

04:23.437 --> 04:24.916
Yeah.Yeah, let me and Gregorio

04:24.960 --> 04:26.091
handle Crane.

04:26.135 --> 04:27.789
All right?
We'll find out how

04:27.832 --> 04:30.966
he obtained the files,
keep you out of it, for now.

04:35.144 --> 04:36.798
All right.

04:36.841 --> 04:38.887
But you need to
make it clear to him

04:38.930 --> 04:40.802
that it's not about me.

04:40.845 --> 04:42.151
That lives
are at stake.

04:42.194 --> 04:44.153
Sebastian, you and
I, we can start

04:44.196 --> 04:45.459
reaching out to witnesses,

04:45.502 --> 04:47.243
make sure that they're safe.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.941
And you're still
not moving.

04:49.985 --> 04:51.508
We just want to make sure
you're okay.

04:51.552 --> 04:52.683
Yeah, like I said, I'm fine.

04:52.727 --> 04:54.119
Can't worry
about myself

04:54.163 --> 04:55.425
until we're sure

04:55.469 --> 04:56.731
there's no collateral damage.

04:56.774 --> 05:00.038
Now, can you go talk to Crane?

05:00.082 --> 05:02.214
Yeah.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.355
I hear King loud and clear,

05:12.399 --> 05:14.270
but I don't care what he
says, he's still worried.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.751
Yeah, well, he worked hard to
stay on the straight and narrow.

05:16.794 --> 05:19.188
Yeah, until this Oliver Crane
dude shows up,

05:19.231 --> 05:20.755
starting all kind of trouble,

05:20.798 --> 05:22.452
distorting the facts.

05:22.496 --> 05:23.975
Doesn't even mention the
lives that Pride saved,

05:24.019 --> 05:25.455
the people he's helped.

05:25.499 --> 05:27.065
No, you're right,
it's a bunch of bull,

05:27.109 --> 05:28.458
but we can't go in there
taking it personal.

05:28.502 --> 05:30.068
I know, I know.

05:30.112 --> 05:32.375
Pride's counting on us to find
out who leaked these files.

05:32.419 --> 05:33.898
That's all that matters.
We got to...

05:33.942 --> 05:35.944
play it cool.You know me,

05:35.987 --> 05:37.772
Gregorio, I'm ice cold.

05:46.737 --> 05:47.999
Oliver Crane.

05:48.043 --> 05:49.958
Special Agents Gregorio
and Lasalle...

05:50.001 --> 05:51.481
Yeah, I know who you are,

05:51.525 --> 05:53.527
you're Dwayne Pride's
goon squad.

05:54.441 --> 05:55.311
Um...

05:55.355 --> 05:56.921
somewhere private we can go?

05:56.965 --> 05:58.009
Anything you have to say to me

05:58.053 --> 05:59.576
can be said in front
of the breakers.

05:59.620 --> 06:00.664
"Breakers."

06:00.708 --> 06:02.057
Yeah, the people in this room

06:02.100 --> 06:03.275
who are dedicated
to exposing the truth,

06:03.319 --> 06:04.364
no matter what the cost.

06:04.407 --> 06:06.148
They're gonna bear witness

06:06.191 --> 06:07.932
to whatever's about
to happen here.Whoa.

06:07.976 --> 06:09.194
We just want to talk.

06:09.238 --> 06:11.371
Like you talked
to Carsen Donner?

06:11.414 --> 06:12.720
I've read your
case files,

06:12.763 --> 06:13.982
so I know your methods.

06:14.025 --> 06:15.200
GREGORIO: The case files
are why we're here.

06:15.244 --> 06:17.202
We need to know
how you got them.

06:17.246 --> 06:20.118
Not gonna reveal my source,

06:20.162 --> 06:23.295
but I didn't intimidate,
bully or beat up anybody

06:23.339 --> 06:25.123
to get the information,
so, you know,

06:25.167 --> 06:26.734
stark contrast to your boss.

06:26.777 --> 06:28.605
Hey, now, hold on a second.GREGORIO:
Mr. Crane,

06:28.649 --> 06:30.607
you published classified
information.

06:30.651 --> 06:31.913
That's against the law.

06:31.956 --> 06:33.436
Well, as a journalist...

06:33.480 --> 06:34.437
Is that what you call yourself?

06:34.481 --> 06:36.178
As a journalist, the story

06:36.221 --> 06:37.484
serves the public interest.

06:37.527 --> 06:38.876
Louisiana Code of
Civil Procedure,

06:38.920 --> 06:40.008
Article 971.

06:40.051 --> 06:41.923
I'm within my rights to publish.

06:41.966 --> 06:43.968
Yeah, the files were
obtained illegally.

06:44.012 --> 06:45.840
Well, now, that would be
your opinion, Agent Lasalle.

06:45.883 --> 06:47.755
GREGORIO: Okay, well,
you don't want to cooperate,

06:47.798 --> 06:49.757
we'll just go get a subpoena.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.498
You can bring it right
to my lawyer's office,

06:51.541 --> 06:52.977
at Connor and Hughes.
There's an entire floor

06:53.021 --> 06:54.457
of their building
just waiting for it.

06:54.501 --> 06:55.937
And while you do,

06:55.980 --> 06:56.981
I'll upload my follow-up,

06:57.025 --> 06:58.330
which will make
Carsen Donner

06:58.374 --> 06:59.331
look like an appetizer.

06:59.375 --> 07:00.507
You don't understand

07:00.550 --> 07:01.899
the severity of what
you're doing here.

07:01.943 --> 07:03.814
No, you don't understand.

07:03.858 --> 07:05.599
Dwayne Pride is dangerous,

07:05.642 --> 07:06.774
and he needs
to be held accountable.

07:06.817 --> 07:08.210
No, you're the dangerous one,

07:08.253 --> 07:10.038
releasing sensitive
information

07:10.081 --> 07:11.343
that can put people's
lives at risk.You know what,

07:11.387 --> 07:13.084
it's my job to expose the truth.

07:13.128 --> 07:14.346
No, your job
is to get little clicks

07:14.390 --> 07:15.913
on your little
pathetic Web site.

07:15.957 --> 07:18.263
You don't know a damn
thing about Dwayne Pride!

07:18.307 --> 07:19.700
Gregorio.You're way over your skis here,

07:19.743 --> 07:21.832
trying to torture people.

07:21.876 --> 07:24.356
Well, keep talking, because
it makes for great footage.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.097
Hey, hey, Gregorio, look around.

07:29.144 --> 07:32.016
All right? Hey, I think
we should leave.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.845
Yeah. I'm done here, anyway.

07:34.889 --> 07:36.456
OLIVER: Done? You're
not even close to done.

07:36.499 --> 07:39.546
You two are gonna be
trending by lunchtime.

07:39.589 --> 07:41.461
Hey, Gregorio, what happened
to playing it cool?

07:41.504 --> 07:42.940
Guy's an ass.Well, agreed,

07:42.984 --> 07:44.159
but you didn't do Pride
any favors.

07:44.202 --> 07:45.290
Didn't I?

07:45.334 --> 07:47.292
DH-37592.

07:47.336 --> 07:50.295
Sounds like a DoD
identification number.

07:50.339 --> 07:53.168
From the classified case
files on Crane's desk.

07:53.211 --> 07:54.952
Oh, son... Gregorio.

07:54.996 --> 07:56.867
Gangsta, right?

07:56.911 --> 07:58.869
PATTON: Might've been gangsta,
but you paid a price.

07:58.913 --> 08:01.002
This video was
uploaded two minutes

08:01.045 --> 08:02.525
after you left
Crane's office,

08:02.569 --> 08:03.744
and it already got 2,000 views.

08:03.787 --> 08:04.875
Well, then,
it's worth it

08:04.919 --> 08:07.138
if the DoD ID leads us
to the leaker.

08:07.182 --> 08:08.357
That helps Pride.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.490
Not if it gets you
in hot water, too.

08:10.533 --> 08:13.014
We need to control damage here,
not add to it.

08:13.057 --> 08:15.016
Hey, I didn't touch the guy.

08:15.059 --> 08:16.365
Plus, I'm walking wounded. I...

08:16.408 --> 08:17.497
This isn't a
joke, Gregorio.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.586
We don't need any more exposure.

08:19.629 --> 08:20.761
PATTON:
Good news,

08:20.804 --> 08:22.197
I got a hit on the ID.

08:22.240 --> 08:25.069
It belongs to Petty Officer
First Class Amanda Bowers.

08:25.113 --> 08:27.637
Signals intel analyst
out of Belle Chasse.

08:27.681 --> 08:29.160
She's got top clearance
and access

08:29.204 --> 08:31.075
to every file
on the NCIS server.

08:31.119 --> 08:32.686
Why would a sailor
with a spotless record

08:32.729 --> 08:35.079
want to leak
classified information?

08:35.123 --> 08:36.559
"Bowers," that sound familiar?

08:36.603 --> 08:38.474
It should.
You arrested her brother,

08:38.518 --> 08:40.911
Leonard Bowers, 2014.

08:40.955 --> 08:43.044
He was impersonating
a Navy SEAL.

08:43.087 --> 08:44.828
Murdered a sailor
to cover it up.

08:44.872 --> 08:48.092
So you arrested her brother,
Amanda Bowers waits four years,

08:48.136 --> 08:50.965
risks court martial and prison
just to get revenge?

08:51.008 --> 08:52.488
Does that make sense?

08:52.532 --> 08:54.011
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

08:54.055 --> 08:56.057
Good work.

08:59.582 --> 09:02.498
I remember Leonard Bowers's
sentencing.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.065
He stood before
the judge all alone.

09:04.108 --> 09:05.675
No family at all.Plus, I checked prison records.

09:05.719 --> 09:07.068
Amanda Bowers

09:07.111 --> 09:09.418
barely visited her brother,
let alone sent a letter.

09:09.461 --> 09:11.420
Whether she had contact
with him or not,

09:11.463 --> 09:13.117
her files ended up
in Crane's article.

09:13.161 --> 09:15.990
We're not the first ones
to get here.

09:19.776 --> 09:20.951
LASALLE:
Federal agents!

09:31.745 --> 09:33.747
Clear.

09:37.054 --> 09:38.839
In here.

09:44.671 --> 09:47.543
That's Petty Officer
Amanda Bowers.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.066
GREGORIO: This case just went
from a security breach

09:49.110 --> 09:50.590
to a murder.

10:05.126 --> 10:06.431
Cause of death, a gunshot

10:06.475 --> 10:07.476
through the left scapula.

10:07.519 --> 10:08.608
She was shot in the back.

10:08.651 --> 10:10.610
She was probably running
from her killer.

10:10.653 --> 10:12.481
Computer's missing,
jewelry box emptied.

10:12.524 --> 10:13.787
Wallet's gone.
Yeah.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.571
Home invasion gone wrong.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.051
Someone wants us to think so.

10:17.094 --> 10:18.313
Too much of a coincidence
that the woman

10:18.356 --> 10:21.055
who leaked
my NCIS case files

10:21.098 --> 10:24.275
ends up dead
in a violent robbery.

10:24.319 --> 10:25.668
You think someone
wanted her quiet?

10:25.712 --> 10:27.975
Well, whoever it was,
they didn't leave a trace.

10:28.018 --> 10:29.585
I mean, this place
has been scrubbed clean.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.500
I-I doubt I'm gonna be able
to pull any biologicals.

10:31.543 --> 10:33.545
Do what you can, Sebastian.

10:39.856 --> 10:42.076
Put her brother away for murder.

10:42.119 --> 10:43.773
She ends up getting killed

10:43.817 --> 10:45.296
four years later.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.516
Her murder's not on you.

10:47.559 --> 10:49.692
It's connected to me.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.346
I see what you're doing,
Dwayne Pride,

10:51.389 --> 10:52.347
and you need to stop it.

10:52.390 --> 10:54.523
What am I doing, Loretta?

10:54.566 --> 10:57.482
You're letting that ridiculous
article of Oliver Crane's

10:57.526 --> 10:59.615
get under your skin
and to your head.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.617
And it certainly
doesn't help you

11:01.661 --> 11:02.705
solve this
young woman's murder.

11:02.749 --> 11:05.099
In other words,
get over myself.

11:05.142 --> 11:06.709
Yes. Go do your job,

11:06.753 --> 11:08.406
find the killer

11:08.450 --> 11:10.626
and stop the intel leaks.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.150
Hey, I got something
you'll want to hear.

11:20.592 --> 11:22.551
We spoke to Bowers' landlord.

11:22.594 --> 11:24.248
Sweet little lady
that lives out back.

11:24.292 --> 11:26.120
She says she didn't
hear anything.

11:26.163 --> 11:27.904
But she said we should talk
to Amanda's boyfriend,

11:27.948 --> 11:28.992
guy named Max.

11:29.036 --> 11:30.254
No last name.

11:30.298 --> 11:31.908
Drives a silver Acura.

11:31.952 --> 11:33.823
Yeah, Amanda and him started
dating a few months ago.

11:33.867 --> 11:35.520
It got serious pretty fast.

11:35.564 --> 11:37.218
She said, uh, his car
was parked out front

11:37.261 --> 11:38.567
practically every morning.

11:38.610 --> 11:40.047
PRIDE: She have
more information

11:40.090 --> 11:42.005
other than the first name
and a vehicle description?

11:42.049 --> 11:44.007
GREGORIO: No, but they were
secretive about the whole thing.

11:44.051 --> 11:46.270
Keeping it on the DL,
but she said the Acura

11:46.314 --> 11:48.359
was parked out front
this morning.

11:48.403 --> 11:50.492
All right, put a BOLO out on the
vehicle. We need to find Max.

11:50.535 --> 11:52.233
At the very least, he can
fill in some of the blanks.

11:52.276 --> 11:53.713
All right.

11:53.756 --> 11:55.497
Special Agent Pride.Oh, here we go.

11:55.540 --> 11:56.759
This is Amanda
Bowers' residence.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.152
What happened in there?

11:58.195 --> 11:59.153
GREGORIO: Mr. Crane,
you're gonna have to leave.

11:59.196 --> 12:00.676
This is a crime scene.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.546
That's 'cause she's dead, right?

12:01.590 --> 12:03.113
LASALLE:
Look, gonna need you

12:03.157 --> 12:04.593
to step back, all right?

12:04.636 --> 12:06.247
CRANE: Is it your turn
to rough me up, Agent Lasalle?

12:06.290 --> 12:07.727
I didn't put a finger on you.All right, Lasalle, Gregorio,

12:07.770 --> 12:09.554
let's move on.Yeah. "Lasalle, Gregorio."

12:09.598 --> 12:11.600
Nobody wants to hear
from you people, anyway.

12:11.643 --> 12:15.299
They want the main event.
What happened, Pride?PRIDE: I'll tell you

12:15.343 --> 12:16.953
what any law enforcement officer
would say to any reporter.

12:16.997 --> 12:18.912
We don't comment
on an active investigation.

12:18.955 --> 12:20.914
Right, but I'm not
any reporter

12:20.957 --> 12:23.525
and you're not any
law enforcement officer.

12:23.568 --> 12:26.397
Amanda was intimately connected
to your reckless behavior.

12:26.441 --> 12:28.182
Are you admitting
that she was your source

12:28.225 --> 12:30.575
for the leaked documents?I'm not the one under scrutiny.

12:30.619 --> 12:32.839
Well, you will be if I bring
you in for questioning.Hey, Pride. Pride.

12:32.882 --> 12:34.318
Go ahead. Detain the press.

12:34.362 --> 12:36.190
All of New Orleans
is watching.

12:36.233 --> 12:38.583
You're not just
an investigator.

12:38.627 --> 12:39.889
Who knows?
You might be a suspect.

12:39.933 --> 12:41.456
Just walk away. He's
trying to bait you.

12:45.677 --> 12:47.723
Get them all out of here.

12:47.767 --> 12:48.680
That's not a denial.

12:48.724 --> 12:49.681
All of them, now.

12:49.725 --> 12:51.335
This is not going
away, Pride.

12:51.379 --> 12:54.817
This isn't going away.

12:54.861 --> 12:56.819
Oliver Crane claims
that you and your team

12:56.863 --> 12:58.734
are trying to intimidate him.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.519
With all due respect, sir,
Oliver Crane is full of crap.

13:01.563 --> 13:03.783
No doubt, Lasalle,
but he's also getting traction.

13:03.826 --> 13:05.610
My phone's ringing off the hook.

13:05.654 --> 13:07.699
Real reporters calling.

13:07.743 --> 13:09.266
Director Vance wants it
contained.

13:09.310 --> 13:12.704
Well, we want to solve a murder
and an intelligence leak.

13:12.748 --> 13:14.271
That goes without saying.

13:14.315 --> 13:17.448
Question I have is are you
the agent to get it done?

13:17.492 --> 13:19.624
My mess, I'll clean it up.

13:19.668 --> 13:22.279
I know you, Dwayne.
The director does, too.

13:22.323 --> 13:24.847
But we're getting pressure
from outside NCIS,

13:24.891 --> 13:26.718
other agencies.

13:26.762 --> 13:28.459
They want to know
why you're still on the job

13:28.503 --> 13:30.679
when you've been accused
of excessive force.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.507
The accusations are false.

13:32.550 --> 13:34.074
But optics are everything here.

13:34.117 --> 13:35.684
You remember what I said

13:35.727 --> 13:37.599
the last time we spoke
like this, Dwayne?

13:37.642 --> 13:39.688
Don't make waves.

13:39.731 --> 13:41.646
Water's pretty damn choppy.

13:41.690 --> 13:42.909
Tell me why I shouldn't

13:42.952 --> 13:44.084
pull you off this investigation
immediately.

13:44.127 --> 13:46.651
Because whoever's
behind the leak

13:46.695 --> 13:48.566
and Amanda Bowers' murder

13:48.610 --> 13:50.742
has exposed my cases.

13:50.786 --> 13:52.309
No one knows them
better than me.

13:52.353 --> 13:53.920
You want to solve this,
you need me.

13:53.963 --> 13:55.878
You can't be the face of
the investigation any longer.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.314
I won't be.

13:57.358 --> 13:58.620
Lasalle will
take the lead.

13:58.663 --> 14:01.753
I'll stay in the background.

14:01.797 --> 14:04.931
Sir, I know how volatile
the situation is.

14:04.974 --> 14:06.846
I'm not looking
to make headlines.

14:06.889 --> 14:08.543
I'm a team player here.

14:08.586 --> 14:09.979
We wouldn't even be having
the conversation

14:10.023 --> 14:13.026
if I thought otherwise, Dwayne.

14:13.069 --> 14:15.071
Don't let me down.

14:16.464 --> 14:20.729
What do you think he meant
when he said "other agencies"?

14:20.772 --> 14:23.210
I have no idea,
Christopher.

14:23.253 --> 14:25.995
Can't be good.

14:27.910 --> 14:30.434
PROTESTORS :
We get no justice,
you get no peace...

14:30.478 --> 14:31.914
Hey, how'd it go?

14:31.958 --> 14:34.264
We still got our jobs
for the time being.

14:34.308 --> 14:37.441
Just tune out the noise
and get to work.

14:37.485 --> 14:38.703
Yeah. Easier said than done.

14:38.747 --> 14:39.879
LASALLE:
What's going on out there?

14:39.922 --> 14:40.923
PATTON:
A bunch of folks out there

14:40.967 --> 14:42.142
having some kind of protest.

14:42.185 --> 14:43.230
Against Pride?

14:43.273 --> 14:45.014
That stupid article, man.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.798
Let's go disperse them.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.975
No. Got to stay focused
on Amanda Bowers.

14:49.018 --> 14:51.064
Any luck tracking down
her mystery boyfriend?

14:51.107 --> 14:52.239
GREGORIO:
Yup. All bad.

14:52.282 --> 14:53.240
None of her friends
or colleagues

14:53.283 --> 14:54.894
knew she was
even dating him.

14:54.937 --> 14:57.070
There's no pictures of him
on her social media

14:57.113 --> 14:59.333
or apartment.
It's like the guy never existed.

14:59.376 --> 15:00.943
PATTON: Except for a number
on her cell phone

15:00.987 --> 15:03.163
she was calling
three and four times a day.

15:03.206 --> 15:05.861
Disconnected an hour
after her murder.

15:05.905 --> 15:06.949
LASALLE: Well, it sounds
less like boyfriend

15:06.993 --> 15:08.516
and more like
murder suspect.

15:08.559 --> 15:09.952
GREGORIO: Judging by the way
he cleaned up after himself

15:09.996 --> 15:11.606
without a trace,

15:11.649 --> 15:13.477
it's more like we're dealing
with a professional.

15:13.521 --> 15:15.740
LASALLE:
Professional what?

15:15.784 --> 15:17.612
Targets Amanda Bowers
to get access to the intel.

15:17.655 --> 15:18.961
Spends months

15:19.005 --> 15:21.572
gaining her trust.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.400
Kills her
as soon as the article hits.

15:23.444 --> 15:25.141
PATTON: Some sort of
intelligence operative?

15:25.185 --> 15:27.274
Foreign government?Maybe.

15:27.317 --> 15:28.797
PROTESTORS :
We get no justice,

15:28.840 --> 15:29.841
you get no peace.

15:29.885 --> 15:31.756
I'm going out there.

15:31.800 --> 15:32.801
PROTESTORS :
...you get no peace.

15:32.844 --> 15:35.064
You sure you want to do that?

15:35.108 --> 15:36.283
PROTESTORS :
...get no peace.

15:36.326 --> 15:37.937
We get no justice,

15:37.980 --> 15:39.416
you get no peace.

15:39.460 --> 15:42.593
We get no justice,
you get no peace.

15:42.637 --> 15:43.943
We get no justice...

15:43.986 --> 15:45.814
Let's go back inside.

15:45.857 --> 15:47.816
Hey, hey, hey, come on.

15:47.859 --> 15:50.384
I know you're all upset.

15:50.427 --> 15:53.865
Look, if you'll just quiet down,
I'll hear you out.Hey, hey!

15:53.909 --> 15:56.216
I'm willing to talk to you,
but we can't talk

15:56.259 --> 15:59.871
if we can't hear each other.

15:59.915 --> 16:02.526
GREGORIO:
Not your choice anymore, boss.

16:02.570 --> 16:03.919
You're going in.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.313
PROTESTORS :
We will not be silent.

16:06.356 --> 16:08.968
Police are violent.
We will not be silent.

16:09.011 --> 16:11.666
Police are violent. We will
not be silent.

16:11.709 --> 16:13.973
Hey, man, you hurt?

16:14.016 --> 16:16.105
Pride, are you hurt?No.

16:16.149 --> 16:20.544
Just... people exercising
their first amendment rights.

16:20.588 --> 16:22.546
No, they were
exercising assault.

16:22.590 --> 16:24.722
Do you see the message
they left for you?

16:24.766 --> 16:25.723
You get an eye
on who threw that?

16:25.767 --> 16:26.811
LASALLE:
NOPD's making chase.

16:26.855 --> 16:28.030
I'm going with them.

16:28.074 --> 16:30.990
No, let them handle
the brick thrower.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.034
You go to Wade and Sebastian.

16:32.078 --> 16:33.862
See if they've learned
anything more

16:33.905 --> 16:34.863
about Amanda Bowers' murder.

16:34.906 --> 16:36.734
Someone's threatening your life.

16:36.778 --> 16:37.909
PRIDE: Yeah, I know,
but we're looking for

16:37.953 --> 16:39.999
an actual killer here.

16:40.042 --> 16:42.001
What if I told you
it's all connected?

16:42.044 --> 16:43.176
Rita, what...?

16:43.219 --> 16:44.786
Ugh, I couldn't get
through the crowd.

16:44.829 --> 16:46.005
I went around back.

16:46.048 --> 16:47.006
Pride gave you a key?

16:47.049 --> 16:49.008
Yeah, I did.

16:49.051 --> 16:51.706
I would've called, but best
to stay off phones right now.

16:51.749 --> 16:53.012
What do you mean,
it's all connected?

16:53.055 --> 16:54.143
Everything
that's happening.

16:54.187 --> 16:56.754
The leak, the article,
the protest.

16:56.798 --> 16:58.626
It's a coordinated
attack, Dwayne,

16:58.669 --> 17:01.020
and you're the target.

17:12.422 --> 17:13.945
Want some coffee?

17:13.989 --> 17:15.251
Oh, I'm coffee-ed out.

17:15.295 --> 17:18.602
How about something stronger?

17:18.646 --> 17:21.127
Uh, we need
to keep our heads clear.

17:21.170 --> 17:22.432
You're in trouble, Dwayne.

17:22.476 --> 17:23.781
Yeah, well, I kind of
got that sense

17:23.825 --> 17:25.696
when the brick
came flying at me.

17:25.740 --> 17:27.829
Yeah, the trouble I'm talking
about doesn't throw bricks.

17:27.872 --> 17:30.397
A lot more dangerous.Someone in D.C., right?

17:30.440 --> 17:33.008
The enemy Isler's been
warning me about for months.

17:33.052 --> 17:36.838
You can't take rumors
and innuendo seriously, Rita.

17:36.881 --> 17:37.969
You can in Washington.

17:38.013 --> 17:39.623
It's our bread and butter.

17:39.667 --> 17:40.711
And I've been digging
into it personally, Dwayne,

17:40.755 --> 17:42.800
and I found something.

17:42.844 --> 17:45.673
Classified DOJ memo

17:45.716 --> 17:47.849
out of the associate
attorney general's office.

17:47.892 --> 17:49.503
If anyone knew I had it,

17:49.546 --> 17:51.940
let alone I was sharing it
with you...

17:51.983 --> 17:54.812
Says I handle my cases
using reckless methods.

17:54.856 --> 17:56.249
Exposing my "agents,

17:56.292 --> 17:57.989
"people of New Orleans
and the U.S. government

17:58.033 --> 17:59.774
to unnecessary, sometimes
catastrophic..."

17:59.817 --> 18:02.037
"Catastrophic risk." Yeah.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.387
They want NCIS New Orleans
shuttered and you gone.

18:04.431 --> 18:06.302
Not a surprise.

18:06.346 --> 18:09.610
Crane's article accuses me of
every type of abuse of power.

18:09.653 --> 18:12.265
DOJ just responded.

18:12.308 --> 18:13.744
No, this memo was circulated

18:13.788 --> 18:15.616
three days
before the article hit.

18:15.659 --> 18:17.531
Who's ever after you
knew that Crane

18:17.574 --> 18:18.923
was gonna release
his exposé.

18:18.967 --> 18:20.751
Suggests they also knew

18:20.795 --> 18:23.754
that there was an intelligence
leak to begin with.

18:23.798 --> 18:27.758
And they were a
part of a cover-up.

18:27.802 --> 18:29.064
Including Amanda Bowers' murder.

18:31.588 --> 18:34.069
Any idea who this enemy is?

18:35.679 --> 18:37.594
Why go to all this trouble?

18:37.638 --> 18:39.422
Why not just put
a bullet in me

18:39.466 --> 18:41.642
instead of letting
other people die?

18:41.685 --> 18:43.644
Assassinating
a federal agent,

18:43.687 --> 18:45.298
especially one
with your profile,

18:45.341 --> 18:47.517
leads to a lot of questions
being asked.

18:47.561 --> 18:49.998
What they're doing
is just as effective.

18:50.041 --> 18:53.044
This is character assassination.

18:55.177 --> 18:56.700
GREGORIO:
Don't mean to interrupt.

18:56.744 --> 18:58.615
Patton and I got something.

18:58.659 --> 19:00.313
Protest outside,

19:00.356 --> 19:01.923
all those people
showing up so fast,

19:01.966 --> 19:04.143
organized out of nowhere.
It didn't make sense.

19:04.186 --> 19:05.927
I told you not to worry
about the protest.

19:05.970 --> 19:07.537
But it connects.
The crowd wasn't no accident.

19:07.581 --> 19:09.452
They were directed here.

19:09.496 --> 19:12.151
Social media went crazy when
Crane's exposé was uploaded.

19:12.194 --> 19:15.197
Accounts from all over the city
were demanding retribution.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.503
People are upset.

19:16.546 --> 19:18.505
Yeah, but these posts
weren't made by people.

19:18.548 --> 19:21.160
They were made by bots.
Programmed algorithms.

19:21.203 --> 19:24.685
Hundreds of them, all stirring
up trouble about you, Pride.

19:24.728 --> 19:28.950
GREGORIO: Look. "NOLABrah682,
BasinCrewe, HurricaneHenry91."

19:28.993 --> 19:31.996
These are fake accounts that
didn't exist two days ago.

19:32.040 --> 19:34.303
It's right out of the
Russian playbook, 2016.

19:34.347 --> 19:35.739
But I'm not running
for office.

19:35.783 --> 19:37.045
I'm just an NCIS agent.

19:37.088 --> 19:38.699
Why use all this firepower?

19:38.742 --> 19:40.962
You pissed somebody off.

19:41.005 --> 19:42.093
Yeah. Got that.

19:42.137 --> 19:45.445
Can you identify
who's behind these bots?

19:45.488 --> 19:47.142
Yeah, but it's gonna
take awhile.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.883
They're coming
from an offshore server,

19:48.926 --> 19:51.102
a dozen layers of security.

19:51.146 --> 19:53.017
I got an old friend at the
NSA that owes me a favor.

19:53.061 --> 19:54.367
Could speed the
process along.

19:54.410 --> 19:56.369
We find who paid for these bots,

19:56.412 --> 19:58.197
we find whoever's got it out
for you, Pride.

19:58.240 --> 20:01.983
More importantly, we can find
Amanda Bowers' killer.

20:03.245 --> 20:04.725
Hey, Carl.
What can I do for you?

20:04.768 --> 20:07.945
It's what I can do for you,
Dwayne Pride.

20:07.989 --> 20:11.122
Got an idea on that guy
that tried to brain you.

20:11.166 --> 20:13.081
Does the name Marcus Green
mean anything to you?

20:13.124 --> 20:14.300
No. Who is he?

20:14.343 --> 20:16.040
Unemployed dock worker.

20:16.084 --> 20:17.564
Has a couple of moving
violations on his record.

20:17.607 --> 20:18.565
Lives in Clearwater.

20:18.608 --> 20:21.002
Clearwater

20:21.045 --> 20:22.830
Heading down
with a couple of units

20:22.873 --> 20:24.223
to pick him up personally.

20:24.266 --> 20:25.702
I'll let you know
when we got him.

20:25.746 --> 20:27.008
Oh, I don't know
if a big police presence

20:27.051 --> 20:29.358
is gonna help matters right now.

20:29.402 --> 20:31.142
Hey, the guy assaulted and
threatened a federal agent.

20:31.186 --> 20:35.059
I take that seriously,
even if that agent is you.

20:35.103 --> 20:37.236
A little more
complicated than that.

20:37.279 --> 20:38.585
Always is with you.

20:38.628 --> 20:40.413
What

20:40.456 --> 20:43.416
I'll fill you in when we're
on our way to Marcus Green.

20:43.459 --> 20:45.200
No, no. You know
you can't be the one

20:45.244 --> 20:46.332
to arrest him.

20:46.375 --> 20:47.507
Well, I don't want
to arrest him.

20:47.550 --> 20:50.901
I just want to talk to him.

20:50.945 --> 20:53.687
WADE: Damn it, the calls
have been coming in nonstop.

20:53.730 --> 20:55.254
Reporters, ain't it?

20:55.297 --> 20:56.080
Yeah, I've been
getting them, too.

20:56.124 --> 20:58.039
No, not only the press.

20:58.082 --> 21:01.085
My superiors at the parish,
they're uncomfortable about me

21:01.129 --> 21:03.305
handling
the Amanda Bowers autopsy.

21:03.349 --> 21:06.047
Well, they don't honestly think
Pride's a suspect in the murder?

21:06.090 --> 21:08.963
No, but he's related to it.

21:09.006 --> 21:12.445
They feel that I'm too close
to be objective.

21:12.488 --> 21:14.751
That's a bunch of bull.

21:14.795 --> 21:16.275
I don't know.

21:16.318 --> 21:19.060
We all got a personal
stake in protecting Pride.

21:19.103 --> 21:20.670
You considering
taking a step back?

21:20.714 --> 21:22.106
Oh, hell no, Christopher.

21:22.150 --> 21:23.630
I'm gonna see this
investigation through.

21:23.673 --> 21:26.067
Unfortunately, I'm
not sure I can help.

21:26.110 --> 21:29.462
Amanda Bowers' autopsy didn't
offer any new evidence,

21:29.505 --> 21:32.334
and the suspect was very
careful when he killed her.

21:32.378 --> 21:33.683
Well, that supports
our theory

21:33.727 --> 21:35.119
that the killer's a pro.

21:35.163 --> 21:36.556
It doesn't get us any
close to IDing him.

21:36.599 --> 21:38.775
Well, he might have been a pro,
but he wasn't perfect.

21:38.819 --> 21:40.124
Give me some good
news, Sebastian.

21:40.168 --> 21:42.170
So, Amanda Bowers'
mysterious boyfriend

21:42.213 --> 21:43.954
managed to scrub
the entire apartment

21:43.998 --> 21:46.174
of any biological traces, but

21:46.217 --> 21:47.654
he did leave behind
some pretty interesting

21:47.697 --> 21:49.656
non-biologicals
in the bathroom sink.

21:49.699 --> 21:52.180
There was a residue
of beeswax, shea butter,

21:52.223 --> 21:54.313
vitamin E, pine resin
and tallow.

21:54.356 --> 21:55.966
And what, exactly,
does that mean?

21:56.010 --> 21:58.360
I don't know.

21:58.404 --> 21:59.448
What are you doing, man?
You playing charades?

21:59.492 --> 22:00.971
Ain't nobody got time for that.

22:01.015 --> 22:02.321
Beard balm, guys.
Come on.

22:02.364 --> 22:03.583
It's used to
soften, lubricate,

22:03.626 --> 22:04.845
and style
the well-groomed beard.

22:04.888 --> 22:06.629
You think all this happens
by itself?

22:06.673 --> 22:08.805
Our suspect has a beard?

22:08.849 --> 22:11.155
That's about a third
of the men in New Orleans.

22:11.199 --> 22:12.983
SEBASTIAN:
Yeah, sure, right.

22:13.027 --> 22:14.071
But that means that
we've eliminated, like,

22:14.115 --> 22:15.290
the other two-thirds.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.987
So I was a little
too pumped about it.

22:17.031 --> 22:18.293
I get it.
I'm gonna keep digging.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.903
Please, Sebastian,

22:19.947 --> 22:21.296
Dwayne needs all the help
we can give him.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.602
I'm sure he's chomping
at the bit

22:22.645 --> 22:25.169
to go out there himself
to solve this.

22:32.742 --> 22:35.266
Marcus Green
lives at 2009.

22:35.310 --> 22:37.443
ESTES: I got officers
in the back for coverage,

22:37.486 --> 22:38.705
just in case.

22:38.748 --> 22:40.271
I don't think
we'll need 'em.

22:40.315 --> 22:41.925
PRIDE: Marcus Green has
no history of violence.

22:41.969 --> 22:43.405
ESTES: Yeah, well, half the
neighborhood does, though.

22:43.449 --> 22:45.276
And considering your
history with Clearwater...

22:45.320 --> 22:47.714
That's why I wanted
to talk to Marcus myself.

22:47.757 --> 22:49.585
Well, you stopped Hamilton
from flooding this place

22:49.629 --> 22:52.109
and hurting a lot of folks,
but all people here know is

22:52.153 --> 22:53.415
you cost them jobs.

22:53.459 --> 22:55.025
Doesn't matter how
many words you use.

22:55.069 --> 22:57.332
They got reason to be angry.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.333
They paid a price.

22:59.813 --> 23:01.205
Marcus Green!

23:01.249 --> 23:02.424
ESTES:
Police!

23:02.468 --> 23:04.557
Open up.

23:09.823 --> 23:11.172
What do you want?

23:11.215 --> 23:12.434
Step outside, please.For what--

23:12.478 --> 23:15.437
so he can rough me up?
No way.

23:15.481 --> 23:18.222
I'm not here to rough you up,
but I would like a word.

23:18.266 --> 23:20.616
I got nothing to say to you.I don't give a crap, you're
gonna follow instructions,

23:20.660 --> 23:22.139
you're gonna keep your hands
where I can see 'em,

23:22.183 --> 23:23.837
you're gonna step outside,
or I'm gonna drag you out.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.926
More abuse of power, huh?Listen, jackass...

23:25.969 --> 23:27.754
Carl......you assaulted and
made death threats

23:27.797 --> 23:29.233
against a federal agent.

23:29.277 --> 23:30.539
If it wasn't for Dwayne Pride,

23:30.583 --> 23:32.585
you'd already be
in an Orleans Parish jail.

23:32.628 --> 23:33.760
So let's go.

23:36.980 --> 23:38.242
Nice and easy.

23:39.983 --> 23:42.986
What do you want?First off,

23:43.030 --> 23:44.814
I know that you
and your neighbors here

23:44.858 --> 23:46.860
haven't had an easy time of it.

23:46.903 --> 23:50.298
You're angry.

23:50.341 --> 23:51.473
Thought you were gonna have
a new job last year

23:51.517 --> 23:52.518
at the shipyard.

23:52.561 --> 23:55.216
All fell apart because of me.

23:55.259 --> 23:56.609
But I did everything
I had to do

23:56.652 --> 23:58.132
to stop something

23:58.175 --> 23:59.699
catastrophic from happening.

23:59.742 --> 24:00.961
But there were consequences.

24:01.004 --> 24:03.833
I just want you to know

24:03.877 --> 24:06.183
I'm sorry.

24:08.403 --> 24:11.362
I never did trust
that Hamilton clown anyway.

24:11.406 --> 24:12.712
ESTES: Yeah, well,
Hamilton's in prison

24:12.755 --> 24:15.149
because of this man, who you
tried to kill earlier.

24:15.192 --> 24:16.890
I didn't try to kill anybody,
man, I just needed the money.

24:16.933 --> 24:17.891
What money?

24:17.934 --> 24:20.459
Guy at the bar last night.

24:20.502 --> 24:22.504
Came in showing everybody
that article.

24:22.548 --> 24:23.984
Getting us all agitated.

24:24.027 --> 24:26.639
Offered $1,000 to see someone
send you a message.

24:26.682 --> 24:28.510
I'm strapped.

24:28.554 --> 24:31.339
That money
means everything.

24:31.382 --> 24:32.949
Did you get a name?

24:35.256 --> 24:36.518
If I put you in front
of a sketch artist,

24:36.562 --> 24:37.911
do you think you'd be
able to describe him?

24:39.956 --> 24:42.524
Yeah, yeah, I guess, man.ESTES: Pride.

24:42.568 --> 24:43.960
We got an issue here.
We gotta go.

24:44.004 --> 24:45.222
Let's go, come on.

24:45.266 --> 24:46.441
Come on.Guys, chill.

24:49.792 --> 24:50.750
Put your hand on my
shoulder, right here.

24:50.793 --> 24:51.838
Let's go.

24:54.797 --> 24:56.451
MAN:
See? See, that's him.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.801
Dwayne Pride.
He's trying to arrest Marcus!

24:58.845 --> 25:01.543
Hey, hey, hey, I need every--
Back up. I need--

25:01.587 --> 25:03.676
Screw you, you not taking him.Stay back, I said.

25:03.719 --> 25:04.677
MARCUS:
Relax, man, it's okay.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.026
You're not going anywhere!

25:06.069 --> 25:07.854
ESTES: Don't touch.
take your hands off--

25:07.897 --> 25:10.378
Back up!

25:10.421 --> 25:12.249
Come on, come on.

25:12.293 --> 25:15.905
10-55.
Officer needs assistance.

25:15.949 --> 25:18.212
Go, go!
Pride, let's go. Move!

25:21.911 --> 25:24.610
[tires screeching,
sirens wailing]

25:47.154 --> 25:48.938
Somebody's got it out
for you, Dwayne.

25:48.982 --> 25:51.114
Orchestrating a leak
of your case files,

25:51.158 --> 25:54.117
coordinating a protest
outside your doors.

25:54.161 --> 25:56.076
Paying Marcus Green
to attack you.

25:56.119 --> 25:59.514
The end game's gotta be
more than discrediting me.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.647
I mean, look, you can
be aggravating.

26:01.690 --> 26:03.083
Thank you.
You're welcome.

26:03.126 --> 26:05.868
But, I mean, who's got
the time or resources, huh?

26:05.912 --> 26:08.349
Or the willingness
to commit murder.

26:08.392 --> 26:10.046
Well, it's a pattern
we've seen before.

26:10.090 --> 26:12.266
The attack on Mayor Taylor
a couple months ago.

26:12.309 --> 26:14.790
Car accident that sidelined
the state attorney general.

26:16.139 --> 26:18.098
RITA:
Dwayne?

26:18.141 --> 26:19.534
Uh, you have a minute?

26:19.578 --> 26:21.971
Excuse me.
Yeah.

26:22.015 --> 26:24.974
You and Patton have
any luck tracing those bots?

26:25.018 --> 26:27.107
So the NSA suggested that

26:27.150 --> 26:28.891
Patton mirror their IP address,

26:28.935 --> 26:30.327
and convince whoever's
running the bots

26:30.371 --> 26:31.938
that he's a foreign hacker
looking for employment,

26:31.981 --> 26:33.374
and it worked.

26:33.417 --> 26:35.071
You got access
to their operation.

26:35.115 --> 26:36.812
Well, Patton's combing
through their server now,

26:36.856 --> 26:40.120
but it was registered to
a shell company in the Caymans

26:40.163 --> 26:41.817
called, uh, Primalytica.

26:41.861 --> 26:43.036
He's trying to figure
out who set it up.

26:43.079 --> 26:45.255
Thank you, Rita.

26:45.299 --> 26:48.955
Thank you for...
coming here,

26:48.998 --> 26:51.174
for helping me.

26:51.218 --> 26:52.611
Despite the current climate,

26:52.654 --> 26:55.178
you still have some
friends by your side...

26:55.222 --> 26:57.224
What, uh...
What?

26:57.267 --> 26:58.965
Did you get punched here?

26:59.008 --> 27:01.663
Yeah, no, I just, uh,
had a little trouble

27:01.707 --> 27:03.839
in Clearwater.Was it the brick thrower?

27:03.883 --> 27:05.711
No, a bunch of other guys.A bunch?

27:05.754 --> 27:08.104
Rita, people are angry.
They're just--

27:08.148 --> 27:09.453
they're just expressing it.

27:09.497 --> 27:12.021
Take the high road
in public, okay?

27:12.065 --> 27:13.283
But this is me here.

27:13.327 --> 27:15.329
You're allowed to be
frustrated at how quickly

27:15.372 --> 27:16.983
people have turned on you.

27:17.026 --> 27:19.072
I'm not gonna blame anyone
else for my situation.

27:19.115 --> 27:20.508
I've pushed the limits
throughout my career.

27:20.551 --> 27:23.554
Maybe... too far.

27:23.598 --> 27:25.644
Don't start doubting
yourself now.

27:25.687 --> 27:27.297
You've done what you had to.

27:27.341 --> 27:29.082
You've helped so many
people, Dwayne, come on.

27:29.125 --> 27:30.692
Even if I had
the best of intentions,

27:30.736 --> 27:33.739
it doesn't mean that
there won't be a reckoning.

27:33.782 --> 27:37.090
ESTES: Hey, Pride...
we got something.

27:39.135 --> 27:41.921
Getting that composite
to every cop in the city.

27:41.964 --> 27:43.574
We'll find him.

27:45.011 --> 27:46.752
SEBASTIAN: Oh, a beard's not
such a terrible clue

27:46.795 --> 27:47.970
after all, is it?

27:48.014 --> 27:49.363
Hey, let's save
the "attaboys"

27:49.406 --> 27:50.843
till we get this guy
in cuffs.

27:50.886 --> 27:53.019
He gets close to Amanda Bowers
to access her intel,

27:53.062 --> 27:55.412
incites Marcus Green
and the rest of the city

27:55.456 --> 27:56.936
to go after Pride.

27:56.979 --> 27:58.198
RITA: Safe bet
he convinced Crane

27:58.241 --> 27:59.765
to publish the article
in the first place.

27:59.808 --> 28:01.680
Yeah, I need to talk
to Crane again.

28:01.723 --> 28:04.030
See what he can tell us
about our suspect.

28:04.073 --> 28:05.727
He's not gonna
give up his sources.

28:05.771 --> 28:08.208
Yeah, well, I can be persuasive
when I have to.

28:08.251 --> 28:10.601
King, you're not going
to see Crane, all right?

28:10.645 --> 28:11.994
Let Gregorio and I
handle it.

28:12.038 --> 28:14.214
Yeah, it only got you
in trouble last time.

28:14.257 --> 28:15.868
Can't afford more
collateral damage.

28:15.911 --> 28:18.740
We're not gonna let you get in
any deeper water.

28:18.784 --> 28:20.089
The deputy director was clear.

28:20.133 --> 28:21.743
All right? He wants you
to stay in the background.

28:21.787 --> 28:23.353
And I heard him, Christopher.

28:23.397 --> 28:24.964
I'm just gonna go
reason with the guy.

28:25.007 --> 28:26.052
SEBASTIAN:
Pride, I mean, I don't know

28:26.095 --> 28:28.184
if it's sleep deprivation
or what,

28:28.228 --> 28:29.316
but you can't reason
with a guy like that.

28:31.100 --> 28:34.103
He's been manipulating
this whole situation,

28:34.147 --> 28:36.192
actively covering his tracks.

28:36.236 --> 28:38.412
He killed Amanda Bowers
to tie up loose ends.

28:38.455 --> 28:40.240
Crane could be next.

28:40.283 --> 28:41.763
RITA:
Appeal to his desire

28:41.807 --> 28:44.374
for self-preservation--
it's not the worst plan.

28:44.418 --> 28:45.941
GREGORIO:
Until your sit-down goes viral,

28:45.985 --> 28:46.986
and you're out of a job.

28:47.029 --> 28:48.988
Crane's gonna cooperate.

28:49.031 --> 28:50.206
How can you be so sure?

28:52.513 --> 28:54.254
Because I'm gonna give
him the one thing

28:54.297 --> 28:56.256
he's wanted this whole time.

28:57.083 --> 28:59.259
Me.

29:06.135 --> 29:10.009
You-You really can't
help yourself, can you?

29:10.052 --> 29:13.142
I mean, don't get me wrong,
this makes for great clickbait,

29:13.186 --> 29:15.797
but damn, you are
a glutton for punishment.

29:15.841 --> 29:17.886
Tell them to turn off
the cameras.Who is this?

29:17.930 --> 29:19.018
New muscle?

29:19.061 --> 29:20.019
I'm his lawyer.

29:20.062 --> 29:22.325
You're gonna sue me?

29:22.369 --> 29:24.893
I'm gonna talk to you.
Alone.

29:24.937 --> 29:27.722
No cameras, no colleagues.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.898
Just us.

29:29.942 --> 29:31.552
CRANE:
On the record?

29:31.595 --> 29:34.860
Not yet, but it's negotiable.

29:38.559 --> 29:40.996
All right.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.345
Turn 'em off.
It's okay.

29:42.389 --> 29:43.346
Everybody can take five.

29:43.390 --> 29:46.219
Come on, we're good.

29:46.262 --> 29:48.134
I'll call you if I need you.

29:52.660 --> 29:54.444
You, too, Counselor.
Out you go.

29:54.488 --> 29:56.185
Not gonna happen.

29:56.229 --> 29:57.708
PRIDE:
Don't waste your breath arguing.

29:57.752 --> 29:59.406
I spent 30 minutes trying
to convince her not to come.

29:59.449 --> 30:02.801
Okay. Whatever.
We're alone. Wow me.

30:02.844 --> 30:05.281
You're being played, Crane.

30:05.325 --> 30:08.807
You're big exposé was
spoon-fed to you

30:08.850 --> 30:10.547
in order to set me up.Come on, man.

30:10.591 --> 30:12.767
Every word of that piece
was 100% accurate.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.638
Who cares why
it was given to me?

30:14.682 --> 30:15.857
You should care.

30:15.901 --> 30:18.338
Because you're a pawn
in something bigger.

30:18.381 --> 30:19.818
So was Amanda Bowers.

30:19.861 --> 30:21.167
And look what happened
to her.

30:21.210 --> 30:24.083
Mm, this feels like
another fishing expedition

30:24.126 --> 30:25.824
to try to get me
to reveal my source.

30:27.303 --> 30:29.479
Amanda Bowers
wasn't your source.

30:31.003 --> 30:33.092
This man was.

30:33.135 --> 30:35.355
I'm not confirming that.

30:35.398 --> 30:37.052
We believe he killed
Amanda Bowers

30:37.096 --> 30:38.271
to keep her quiet.

30:38.314 --> 30:39.533
Who do you think's next?

30:43.929 --> 30:45.278
All right,

30:45.321 --> 30:46.801
what do you want from me?

30:46.845 --> 30:49.282
Anything you know
about that man.

30:49.325 --> 30:50.544
What do I get?

30:50.587 --> 30:51.937
How about continuing
to breathe?

30:51.980 --> 30:53.329
That's always a plus.

30:53.373 --> 30:54.809
I'm gonna give you
a story,

30:54.853 --> 30:56.898
bigger than New Orleans--
national headlines.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.595
Enough to put you
back on the map.

30:58.639 --> 31:00.510
About a conspiracy
to take me down

31:00.554 --> 31:02.338
that goes all the way
to Washington.

31:02.382 --> 31:04.775
Right to the top
of the DOJ pyramid.

31:06.386 --> 31:08.301
PRIDE: You help us
find this man,

31:08.344 --> 31:11.086
and I will handyou...

31:11.130 --> 31:14.394
the biggest story
of your career.

31:14.437 --> 31:17.136
Even answer every question
you throw at me.

31:23.620 --> 31:26.580
MAN: Petty Officer Bowers
is a patriot.

31:26.623 --> 31:29.191
No one can know
that this came from her...

31:29.235 --> 31:31.150
or that I gave it to you.

31:31.193 --> 31:33.152
SEBASTIAN: Thank God
Crane records everything.

31:33.195 --> 31:34.849
Still... Crane's a snake.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.764
I guess he's
our snake now.

31:36.807 --> 31:39.506
Gave us the motel where
the suspect was staying,

31:39.549 --> 31:41.421
and the license plate
of the Acura he's driving.

31:41.464 --> 31:43.379
SEBASTIAN: Means we have
a fighting chance of finding him

31:43.423 --> 31:45.294
before anyone else
gets hurt.Spoke to Estes.

31:45.338 --> 31:47.296
NOPD just found
the suspect's Acura

31:47.340 --> 31:48.819
parked three blocks

31:48.863 --> 31:50.473
from the train station.
Still might be there.

31:50.517 --> 31:51.953
All right, let's go.GREGORIO: Uh-uh.

31:51.997 --> 31:53.520
You stay this time.
We don't need another

31:53.563 --> 31:55.739
Clearwater incident.You don't have
to worry about that.

31:55.783 --> 31:56.827
RITA:
Dwayne.

31:56.871 --> 31:58.264
Let your team handle it.

31:58.307 --> 31:59.830
It's what they're here for.

31:59.874 --> 32:01.441
LASALLE:
Trust us.

32:01.484 --> 32:03.486
We'll get this guy.

32:07.882 --> 32:09.057
Then go get him.

32:13.322 --> 32:15.281
ESTES: I've got officers
stationed at every entrance,

32:15.324 --> 32:17.326
exit and track.
Nobody with a beard

32:17.370 --> 32:19.415
is getting out of here
until we find the suspect.

32:19.459 --> 32:21.504
ANNOUNCER: Now boarding, on
track two, train to Chicago.

32:21.548 --> 32:23.332
Now boarding, track two.Gregorio, Sebastian.

32:23.376 --> 32:24.725
You guys see anything?

32:24.768 --> 32:26.770
Whole lot of nothing so far.

32:26.814 --> 32:28.424
Yeah, Patton's getting the
CCTV feed from the station,

32:28.468 --> 32:31.253
so hopefully,
we'll get a bird's-eye view.

32:31.297 --> 32:32.733
PATTON:
Nothing so far.

32:32.776 --> 32:34.953
But I'm running facial
comparison algorithms.

32:34.996 --> 32:36.432
If he's there,
we'll find him.

32:38.217 --> 32:40.784
Three trains have left
in the past couple of hours.

32:40.828 --> 32:42.351
Could be he's already gone.

32:42.395 --> 32:43.570
PRIDE:
Then we'll contact every station

32:43.613 --> 32:45.615
those trains are headed for.

32:45.659 --> 32:47.487
He's not slipping away,
Christopher.

32:47.530 --> 32:49.489
No, sir, he's not. I got him.

32:49.532 --> 32:51.317
He's coming out
of the men's room,

32:51.360 --> 32:52.492
in the south corridor.

32:52.535 --> 32:54.755
You sure, Patton? We...
We don't see him.

32:54.798 --> 32:56.800
PRIDE: He shaved his beard.
Wearing a leather jacket,

32:56.844 --> 32:58.802
and he's headed for track two.

32:58.846 --> 32:59.978
Sending you a screen grab now.

33:06.506 --> 33:09.204
SEBASTIAN:
Lasalle, nine o'clock.

33:19.954 --> 33:20.911
We're on him!

33:24.350 --> 33:25.481
Move, move, move!

33:32.575 --> 33:34.577
Police, get out of the way!

33:34.621 --> 33:36.014
Police!

33:39.539 --> 33:40.583
Go, go!

33:40.627 --> 33:42.759
I'll meet you around
the other side!

33:47.547 --> 33:49.679
Freeze!

33:49.723 --> 33:51.899
Get down, get your
hands in the air, now!

33:51.942 --> 33:53.335
Get your hands up!

33:53.379 --> 33:55.468
Hands up. Down
on the ground.

33:55.511 --> 33:56.904
Get down on the ground.

33:58.558 --> 34:00.342
Get down, now!

34:00.386 --> 34:01.865
Down on the ground, let's go.

34:03.171 --> 34:04.564
Hey.

34:12.572 --> 34:14.400
Gregorio, Sebastian.

34:14.443 --> 34:16.402
We lost him, he's on
the other side of the tracks.

34:16.445 --> 34:18.578
GREGORIO:
All over it, Lasalle.

34:39.773 --> 34:41.601
Aah!

34:44.734 --> 34:45.561
Sebastian!

34:51.480 --> 34:52.873
You see that?

34:52.916 --> 34:54.396
You see what I did?

34:54.440 --> 34:55.702
Yeah, baby.

35:10.151 --> 35:12.110
GREGORIO:
Suspect's name is Max Burris.

35:12.153 --> 35:14.895
Former intelligence operative
out of Virginia.

35:14.938 --> 35:16.636
That means
he's got the skill set

35:16.679 --> 35:18.507
to pull off
this whole operation.

35:18.551 --> 35:19.726
Yeah, plus Patton accessed
bank records

35:19.769 --> 35:21.728
that connect him
to Primalytica,

35:21.771 --> 35:24.557
it's the company that set up
the bot attack on you.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.124
LASALLE: We got him dead to
rights for the intel leak.

35:26.167 --> 35:28.691
But nothing to put him away
for Amanda Bowers's murder.

35:28.735 --> 35:30.606
Not yet, but we're
working on it.
Yeah.

35:30.650 --> 35:31.738
And while you do,
I'm gonna find out

35:31.781 --> 35:33.174
who he answers to,

35:33.218 --> 35:34.958
and why he's been targeting me.

35:35.002 --> 35:37.135
Actually, Dwayne, you're not.

35:38.266 --> 35:39.789
PRIDE:
Karen.

35:39.833 --> 35:41.835
I know
the U.S. attorney

35:41.878 --> 35:44.881
wants a piece of this guy
'cause of the intel leak,

35:44.925 --> 35:46.666
but you're gonna have to wait.

35:46.709 --> 35:48.668
Didn't come to
talk to Max Burris.

35:48.711 --> 35:49.756
Came to talk to you.

35:49.799 --> 35:51.236
Let's talk.

35:51.279 --> 35:52.846
We'll do it
at the Federal Building.

35:52.889 --> 35:54.674
Karen, I'm about
to start an interrogation.

35:54.717 --> 35:55.936
Not anymore, you're not.

35:58.634 --> 35:59.374
You kidding me?

35:59.418 --> 36:00.897
No.

36:00.941 --> 36:02.508
And I'm not asking, either.

36:19.960 --> 36:22.092
Gregorio, Lasalle,

36:22.136 --> 36:23.485
get Burris to spill.

36:25.487 --> 36:26.662
What about you?

36:26.706 --> 36:28.708
I'll be fine.

36:34.931 --> 36:36.542
IZZO:
Have a seat, Dwayne.

36:36.585 --> 36:39.022
15-minute car ride, and
you didn't say a word.

36:39.066 --> 36:41.286
We're not here
for a casual conversation.

36:41.329 --> 36:43.244
Figured that out after
I saw you had an FBI escort

36:43.288 --> 36:45.333
to take me here.

36:45.377 --> 36:46.421
What's going on?

36:46.465 --> 36:47.944
You're under investigation.

36:47.988 --> 36:50.556
For excessive use of force
and abuse of power.

36:50.599 --> 36:52.645
This is about the article.This is about answering

36:52.688 --> 36:55.865
for a career of reckless choices
and dangerous actions.

36:55.909 --> 36:56.910
Karen.

36:56.953 --> 36:59.652
It's me.

36:59.695 --> 37:00.740
How long we known each other?

37:00.783 --> 37:02.742
Worked together?Are you suggesting

37:02.785 --> 37:04.309
I have a conflict of interest?

37:04.352 --> 37:05.353
Because I assure you,

37:05.397 --> 37:07.181
I don't.
I'm suggesting

37:07.225 --> 37:09.836
that someone at the DOJ
put you up to this.

37:09.879 --> 37:12.404
It's okay to tell me:
are you being pressured?Damn it.

37:12.447 --> 37:13.883
This is my interview.

37:13.927 --> 37:15.189
I'm asking
the questions.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.104
Now sit down.

37:28.898 --> 37:30.987
We'll start with the events

37:31.031 --> 37:32.293
leading up to the assault
and abduction

37:32.337 --> 37:33.860
of Carsen Donner.

37:37.951 --> 37:39.648
BURRIS:
Look.

37:39.692 --> 37:41.650
We can go round
and round all day.

37:41.694 --> 37:42.869
You can show me as many photos

37:42.912 --> 37:44.436
of this girl's dead body
as you want.

37:44.479 --> 37:46.176
I still got nothing to say.

37:46.220 --> 37:48.178
You're acting
like you got all the cards here.

37:48.222 --> 37:49.745
But you're finished.

37:49.789 --> 37:51.834
We got you on tape passing
top secret Navy files

37:51.878 --> 37:53.749
to Oliver Crane.

37:53.793 --> 37:55.011
Got witnesses

37:55.055 --> 37:56.926
who saw you offer
a thousand dollars

37:56.970 --> 37:58.928
to attack Dwayne Pride.Not to mention proof

37:58.972 --> 38:02.367
of the Internet
smear campaign you financed

38:02.410 --> 38:03.542
to take him down.

38:03.585 --> 38:05.021
LASALLE:
And we know that you were

38:05.065 --> 38:07.328
the last person that saw
Amanda Bowers alive.

38:07.372 --> 38:08.721
We have the cards.

38:08.764 --> 38:10.331
And you have one play.

38:10.375 --> 38:13.334
That's to talk,
and tell us everything you know.

38:13.378 --> 38:16.294
You've got a lot of cards.

38:16.337 --> 38:18.339
I'll give you that.

38:18.383 --> 38:21.211
But I've got the only card
that matters.

38:25.172 --> 38:27.174
Uh, we have an issue.

38:38.141 --> 38:40.013
Dell Whitman,

38:40.056 --> 38:42.885
senior criminal defense attorney
with Connor and Hughes.

38:42.929 --> 38:43.886
We're here to
collect Max Burris.

38:43.930 --> 38:46.193
Didn't ask for a lawyer.

38:46.236 --> 38:48.064
And well, yet, here we are.

38:48.108 --> 38:49.327
Can you please

38:49.370 --> 38:51.067
produce our client?

38:51.111 --> 38:52.242
Oh, client's not going anywhere.

38:52.286 --> 38:53.940
We got him on about
a dozen charges

38:53.983 --> 38:56.508
for leaking classified
documents.

38:56.551 --> 38:57.683
You're welcome
to join us in interrogation

38:57.726 --> 38:58.901
while we question him
about the murder

38:58.945 --> 39:00.250
of a Navy sailor,

39:00.294 --> 39:01.687
but we're not done.

39:01.730 --> 39:03.645
You are most certainly done.

39:03.689 --> 39:05.038
I spoke to the U.S. attorney
for the Eastern District.

39:05.081 --> 39:07.257
The government is declining

39:07.301 --> 39:10.086
to charge Mr. Burris for the
leaked documents at this time.

39:10.130 --> 39:11.392
SEBASTIAN:
I called to confirm.

39:11.436 --> 39:13.002
It's true.
DELL:
And since

39:13.046 --> 39:15.135
I have it on good authority
that you've got no evidence

39:15.178 --> 39:19.661
Mr. Burris committed murder,
it seems that he's free to go.

39:22.098 --> 39:25.667
Now, I'd like to see my client.

39:28.104 --> 39:30.106
Go ahead, Roy, let them in.

39:36.504 --> 39:39.246
"Connor and Hughes,"
isn't that the same law firm

39:39.289 --> 39:41.074
that represents Oliver Crane?

39:41.117 --> 39:42.423
Can't be a coincidence.

39:42.467 --> 39:43.555
We're really gonna let
Burris go?

39:43.598 --> 39:44.904
GREGORIO:
If the U.S. attorney

39:44.947 --> 39:46.296
won't charge him,
and we can't prove murder,

39:46.340 --> 39:48.473
we don't have a choice.

39:48.516 --> 39:50.431
We'll get that joker
back though.

39:50.475 --> 39:55.175
I promise. My real worry is,
what's happening with Pride?

39:56.437 --> 39:57.786
PRIDE:
Everything in the Donner case

39:57.830 --> 40:00.702
was documented in
the report, which you,

40:00.746 --> 40:03.139
and everyone else
in New Orleans has access to,

40:03.183 --> 40:04.402
thanks to this leak.

40:04.445 --> 40:06.360
It's not just about
the Donner case, Dwayne.

40:06.404 --> 40:09.058
It's about dozens
of instances over the years.

40:09.102 --> 40:10.973
I stand by the decisions
I've made.

40:11.017 --> 40:13.411
That's not the posture
you want to take here.

40:13.454 --> 40:15.108
That article
exposes you

40:15.151 --> 40:18.938
and the DOJ to any number
of civil lawsuits.

40:18.981 --> 40:20.418
Convictions overturned.

40:20.461 --> 40:21.549
It's a mess.

40:21.593 --> 40:23.986
Someone has to pay.

40:24.030 --> 40:26.336
And I'm the price?

40:28.382 --> 40:31.124
Grand jury is being
convened immediately.

40:31.167 --> 40:33.561
You got to know,
they're gonna indict.

40:33.605 --> 40:35.128
For now,
you're free to go.

40:35.171 --> 40:36.695
But you need
to turn over

40:36.738 --> 40:38.261
your badge and your weapon.

40:38.305 --> 40:41.264
And you can have
no contact with NCIS.

40:41.308 --> 40:44.267
Why are you doing this, Karen?

40:51.187 --> 40:52.667
It's not me, Dwayne.

40:52.711 --> 40:54.495
Or my boss.

40:54.539 --> 40:56.062
Not even hisboss.

40:57.237 --> 40:58.543
You see what I'm saying?

41:01.241 --> 41:02.938
Get yourself a lawyer.

41:02.982 --> 41:04.505
A good one.

41:04.549 --> 41:06.638
Fast.

41:16.474 --> 41:18.693
Lasalle told me
they brought you in.

41:18.737 --> 41:21.261
I've been making calls
to D.C. on your behalf.

41:21.304 --> 41:23.611
We'll sort it out.Nothing to sort.

41:23.655 --> 41:26.614
Grand jury meets in the
morning, I'm being charged.

41:26.658 --> 41:28.355
Like hell.

41:28.398 --> 41:30.139
I'll go to
the attorney general himself.

41:30.183 --> 41:33.186
No, you won't. You'll go home,
and stop making noise.

41:33.229 --> 41:35.318
You've stuck your neck
out enough as it is.

41:35.362 --> 41:36.450
I'm not leaving you, Dwayne.

41:36.494 --> 41:39.148
You want to help?

41:39.192 --> 41:40.541
You got to survive.

41:40.585 --> 41:42.238
Go back to D.C.,

41:42.282 --> 41:45.198
keep your head down,
and your ears open.

41:45.241 --> 41:46.460
I need someone there

41:46.504 --> 41:49.289
who has my back.

41:51.639 --> 41:53.423
It's the only way.

41:57.297 --> 42:00.039
And what are you gonna do?

42:01.606 --> 42:04.086
I have no idea.

42:04.130 --> 42:06.393
But one thing's for sure.

42:06.436 --> 42:12.051
Whoever's after me is not taking
me down without a fight.
