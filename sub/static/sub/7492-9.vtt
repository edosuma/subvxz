WEBVTT

00:06.500 --> 00:07.583
Wasabi!

00:08.375 --> 00:10.667
All right, guys. Who's ready to sign up?

00:13.750 --> 00:15.750
Who's just here for the free jock strap?

00:21.375 --> 00:23.542
They took every jock strap in the box.

00:23.625 --> 00:26.083
I think they even got
the one I was wearing.

00:27.166 --> 00:30.583
Every month, Rudy forces us to do
these lame promotions down the street

00:30.667 --> 00:32.458
from the Black Dragons
to drum up business.

00:32.542 --> 00:33.500
But it never works.

00:33.583 --> 00:35.792
He's probably preparing his latest
desperate attempt

00:35.875 --> 00:38.250
to spread the word about
the Bobby Wasabi Dojo.

00:46.542 --> 00:49.875
Behold Wasab-A-Saurus!

00:49.959 --> 00:51.208
If you think this thing's awesome,

00:51.250 --> 00:56.792
well, come check out the monster deals
at the Bobby Wasabi Dojo, Dojo, Dojo!

00:56.875 --> 00:59.750
That is awesome!
Rudy, where'd you get this thing?

00:59.834 --> 01:02.875
I rented it
at Bed, Bath, and Monster Trucks.

01:03.667 --> 01:06.458
And by parking out here
in front of the Black Dragon Dojo,

01:06.542 --> 01:09.125
people will be talking about us
instead of them.

01:09.667 --> 01:10.500
<i>Ooh! Ooh!</i>

01:10.583 --> 01:12.583
You guys want me to rev this baby up,
get some attention?

01:12.667 --> 01:13.792
- No!
- On it!

01:15.709 --> 01:19.959
I got myself a gift for dealing
with my midlife crisis so well.

01:20.041 --> 01:21.625
That car outside.

01:21.709 --> 01:23.834
It's half Jaguar, half Lamborghini.

01:24.333 --> 01:25.542
It's a Jag-A-Weenie.

01:56.041 --> 01:57.792
Look what you did to my dojo.

01:59.458 --> 02:01.667
You should see what I did
to your Jag-A-Weenie.

02:50.333 --> 02:53.583
Rudy put his foot on the gas,
lost control, and destroyed their dojo.

02:54.834 --> 02:56.458
Sam, why don't you go
play with your friends?

02:56.542 --> 02:57.709
I don't have any friends.

02:57.792 --> 02:59.250
Then do what I do and make some up.

03:01.417 --> 03:04.125
It's going to take two weeks
to repair the Black Dragon Dojo.

03:04.208 --> 03:08.000
So, in the meantime,
you are going to let them train here.

03:08.083 --> 03:09.709
Absolutely not.

03:09.792 --> 03:13.250
Fine, then you can pay
the $50,000 in damages.

03:13.333 --> 03:15.417
- I love company.
- Good.

03:18.500 --> 03:19.333
Ty.

03:19.417 --> 03:20.417
Kai?

03:20.500 --> 03:21.583
Hi.

03:21.667 --> 03:22.959
Why?

03:24.458 --> 03:26.834
Dragons. Drag-ify!

03:30.208 --> 03:32.083
What... Milton, what are you doing?

03:32.834 --> 03:34.250
What are you talking about?
I'm trying to...

03:34.917 --> 03:36.792
Holy Christmas nuts!

03:37.667 --> 03:39.250
I've been Drag-ified.

03:39.750 --> 03:41.000
Hello there, Kai.

03:41.375 --> 03:44.458
I haven't seen you since you cheated
in that tournament and almost killed me.

03:44.542 --> 03:46.458
Yeah, I'm back in town.

03:46.542 --> 03:48.959
I heard the Black Dragons
were your mortal enemy.

03:49.041 --> 03:50.291
That was good enough for me.

03:52.375 --> 03:55.208
This shelf is the perfect place
for my ant farm.

03:55.291 --> 03:56.834
I just have to get rid
of this stupid weed.

03:56.917 --> 03:57.750
Hey!

03:57.834 --> 04:02.458
This is an ancient bonsai tree
given to me by a Tibetan monk.

04:02.542 --> 04:07.542
It's a symbol of patience, calmness,
and peace.

04:07.625 --> 04:10.458
And if you so much as touch it,
I will use it to break your face!

04:14.333 --> 04:15.750
I really can't believe I have to say this,

04:15.834 --> 04:17.875
but I just found out
my parents aren't going out of town,

04:17.959 --> 04:19.375
so the party's off.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.792
No, no, no! The party can't be off.

04:21.875 --> 04:23.750
We just gotta find
another place to have it.

04:23.834 --> 04:26.250
Uh... Who are you?

04:26.333 --> 04:29.000
You're funny, Malcolm. I'm Sam.

04:29.083 --> 04:31.333
So you're the cool kids
and I'm sitting with you.

04:31.417 --> 04:33.417
I must be one of the cool kids.

04:33.917 --> 04:35.041
Wilson, bounce him.

04:39.792 --> 04:43.875
You, me, Saturday night, my mansion?

04:44.417 --> 04:46.625
Shh!

04:48.166 --> 04:50.750
Don't let words spoil what we have.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.375
-
- Ow!

04:54.500 --> 04:56.542
All right, next time, just use your words.

04:59.834 --> 05:02.208
Hey, Malcolm,
what if I told you that this Saturday,

05:02.250 --> 05:04.208
you could throw your party at my mansion?

05:04.250 --> 05:05.875
I'd say,
"Welcome to the cool kids' table."

05:09.375 --> 05:11.417
Somebody ate my empanadas!

05:11.500 --> 05:13.625
They were in the refrigerator
with my name on them.

05:13.709 --> 05:16.458
My grandmother made them for me
and somebody just ate them.

05:16.542 --> 05:20.333
I'd tell your grandma a little more empa,
a little less nada.

05:22.458 --> 05:24.667
The Black Dragons
have been hogging the shower.

05:24.750 --> 05:26.458
I had to bathe in the fountain.

05:26.959 --> 05:28.792
The fountain where everyone
throws their coins?

05:28.875 --> 05:29.875
Yeah!

05:30.542 --> 05:31.792
Don't ask me how.

05:31.875 --> 05:34.458
But I just coughed
and made change for a dollar.

05:42.125 --> 05:43.333
Frank is creeping me out.

05:43.417 --> 05:44.959
I mean, just because
we're sharing a locker,

05:45.041 --> 05:46.458
he's acting like we're married.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.792
Jack, get up here and demonstrate
a proper dragon kick.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.709
Stop! Come on, guys, you're senseis.

06:18.792 --> 06:19.750
You know he's right,

06:19.834 --> 06:21.542
we shouldn't be fighting
in front of the students.

06:21.625 --> 06:23.583
- Parking lot of Jones Beach?
- You're on.

06:23.667 --> 06:25.500
Can I get a ride? My car is in the shop.

06:25.583 --> 06:27.083
So is mine. We'll take my bike,

06:27.166 --> 06:28.333
but you're riding in the basket.

06:28.417 --> 06:29.709
That's how I like it.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.792
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

06:33.875 --> 06:36.792
And this is my throne room.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.458
That is the coolest chair I've ever seen.

06:40.542 --> 06:41.834
Chair?

06:41.917 --> 06:45.333
No, this is the world's
first motorized throne

06:45.417 --> 06:48.583
that is completely powered by...

06:49.667 --> 06:52.041
electric Egyptian catfish.

06:54.083 --> 06:55.667
You said you were cool.

06:55.750 --> 06:57.208
I didn't know you were this cool.

06:57.291 --> 07:00.250
Oh, yeah, that's because
I have what they call "it".

07:00.333 --> 07:03.375
And my doctor says
it may clear up or it may not.

07:05.083 --> 07:08.000
Uh, hey, Bobby,
I'm trying to make some new friends.

07:08.083 --> 07:09.375
Will you let me throw a party here?

07:09.458 --> 07:12.500
Absolutely not!

07:12.583 --> 07:15.417
Trust me, Sam, friends are overrated.

07:15.500 --> 07:18.250
All you need in life is yourself.

07:18.542 --> 07:20.125
- Really?
- Definitely.

07:20.208 --> 07:22.250
Ha! What's a friend good for?

07:22.625 --> 07:25.750
A kind word? A gesture of support?

07:26.250 --> 07:30.166
That toothy smile that just says,
"Hang in there, champ!"

07:31.500 --> 07:35.083
Oh, yes, of course,
you can have your party here.

07:35.375 --> 07:37.917
Thanks, Bobby. You're my best friend.

07:40.125 --> 07:42.834
I do have a friend.

07:43.333 --> 07:45.166
You were wrong, Mother!

07:49.208 --> 07:53.000
You are so pathetic.

07:53.083 --> 07:55.583
You have the nerve to follow me
to the movie theater

07:55.667 --> 07:57.375
after I kicked your butt at Jones Beach?

07:57.458 --> 07:59.709
First of all, I kicked your butt.

07:59.792 --> 08:01.166
And I didn't follow you here.

08:01.250 --> 08:06.083
I am meeting my date
who's a girl and who exists.

08:07.250 --> 08:08.875
Is this your first time
seeing <i>Kung Fu Farm,</i>

08:08.959 --> 08:11.333
starring martial arts legend J.J. Bland?

08:11.417 --> 08:13.875
Yeah, it would be
if it was eight times ago.

08:13.959 --> 08:15.709
- It's like nine times for me, so...
- Huh.

08:17.792 --> 08:20.458
I love it when the mystical warrior
takes over the rooster's body,

08:20.542 --> 08:23.291
and corners the evil farmer
in the hen house and says...

08:23.375 --> 08:25.875
- "Prepare to cock-a-doodle-die!"
- "Prepare to cock-a-doodle-die!"

08:34.375 --> 08:36.583
Uh, Rudy, those guys just cut you.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.542
Uh, excuse me, sir, you can't...

08:51.875 --> 08:55.875
Huh, that was a pretty sweet
back fist to knee you had there.

08:55.959 --> 08:58.667
Thank you.
Your crane technique was flawless.

08:59.625 --> 09:01.834
What do you say when we get in there
we share a popcorn?

09:02.333 --> 09:04.792
Ah, no, I don't, uh, buy popcorn.

09:05.250 --> 09:07.250
I make it fresh with my "Pants Popper."

09:14.333 --> 09:16.417
I'm so getting one of those.

09:20.583 --> 09:21.709
That's it, Dennis!

09:21.792 --> 09:24.208
You used my soap on a rope.

09:24.291 --> 09:25.500
That's your pit hair.

09:25.583 --> 09:27.083
I know it's not mine. I checked.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.750
All three are still there.

09:30.041 --> 09:31.000
Let's go!

09:31.083 --> 09:32.500
Oh, hon!

09:32.583 --> 09:36.083
Mother wants you to wear this dress
when we go antiquing.

09:36.875 --> 09:38.208
It's lovely.

09:47.959 --> 09:49.083
I want to use that dummy.

09:49.166 --> 09:50.250
Step off.

09:50.375 --> 09:52.250
And what makes you think
I'm just gonna step aside

09:52.333 --> 09:54.041
because you want to use
this punching dummy?

09:54.125 --> 09:57.542
Because with one kick,
I can make you gargle your kidneys.

09:58.583 --> 09:59.959
Okay, we understand each other.

10:01.417 --> 10:04.458
Hey, what are you doing?
Jerry was using this dummy.

10:04.542 --> 10:05.750
I can do what I want.

10:05.834 --> 10:07.750
I'm the best student in the dojo, Jack.

10:07.834 --> 10:10.000
Oh, you think you're
the best student in the dojo, huh?

10:10.083 --> 10:11.834
- Yeah. Yeah, maybe I do.
- You want to prove it?

10:11.917 --> 10:13.333
Just like we did on the Great Wall, huh?

10:13.417 --> 10:15.875
- That's your pit hair...
- Big news, everybody.

10:15.959 --> 10:18.208
Me and my new best friend Ty,

10:18.291 --> 10:21.500
have decided to join forces
and combine our dojos...

10:22.083 --> 10:23.000
permanently!

10:23.083 --> 10:24.083
What?

10:24.166 --> 10:27.375
Which means
we're all one big, happy family.

10:31.667 --> 10:34.041
And now, popcorn for everyone!

10:38.917 --> 10:40.625
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

10:42.792 --> 10:44.041
I can't take this anymore!

10:44.125 --> 10:47.250
I'm getting mail addressed
to "Mr. & Mrs. Frank Bickle".

10:47.333 --> 10:49.792
That's me! Mrs. Bickle!

10:50.291 --> 10:52.875
We should probably keep this
with our phone bill, hon.

10:54.750 --> 10:58.041
Calm down, it's only a matter of time
before Rudy and Ty remember

10:58.125 --> 10:59.417
that they can't stand each other.

11:07.208 --> 11:11.041
Uh. Please tell me there were other
people in there dancing with you.

11:12.625 --> 11:13.625
- No.
- No.

11:15.667 --> 11:18.166
We were practicing
for our square dancing date

11:18.250 --> 11:19.667
with the Delmonico twins tonight.

11:20.542 --> 11:23.250
All right, we have to work together
to drive our senseis apart.

11:23.333 --> 11:26.125
Nothing on Earth could ever
make me team up with you.

11:26.208 --> 11:27.792
All right, bring it in, people.

11:27.875 --> 11:31.417
Because we are one dojo now,
we got a new wall mural.

11:31.500 --> 11:34.625
It's half Rudy and half me. Uh?

11:37.083 --> 11:38.000
Huh?

11:39.583 --> 11:41.166
- Hey, Jack.
- Yeah?

11:41.417 --> 11:42.417
I'm in.

11:51.333 --> 11:52.917
Nachos!

11:53.333 --> 11:56.000
Word to the wise,
they've got quite a kick to 'em.

11:56.083 --> 11:59.750
I make them with a single drop
of my Bobby Wa-hot-y Sauce.

12:03.834 --> 12:06.458
Whoa, your dad's at the party?

12:06.542 --> 12:07.542
Lame.

12:08.083 --> 12:10.083
No, he's not my dad. He's my...

12:10.166 --> 12:11.500
- Uh... Mother.
- Butler.

12:11.583 --> 12:13.792
Butler. Right. Definitely butler.

12:13.875 --> 12:15.208
Uh, Bobbington.

12:15.291 --> 12:18.500
Bobbington the butler.
That is who I am to the boy.

12:20.583 --> 12:22.000
You've got your own Butler?

12:22.792 --> 12:24.291
That's awesome.

12:25.125 --> 12:26.750
That means he has to do anything
we tell him.

12:27.750 --> 12:31.041
Okay, Bobbington,
drink this bottle of Wa-hot-y Sauce.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.208
Uh, Bobbington, um...

12:33.625 --> 12:36.333
- You don't have to drink that bottle--
- I thought you were cool, Sam.

12:36.792 --> 12:38.166
Come on, guys.

12:38.250 --> 12:40.375
- Let's get out of here.
- Wait, wait, wait!

12:40.458 --> 12:41.709
Sam is cool.

12:42.166 --> 12:44.458
I'll show you just how cool he is.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.333
Fire in the hole!

13:04.333 --> 13:06.542
Spicy!

13:11.500 --> 13:13.792
Ty's ants are Chinese wood-eating ants.

13:13.875 --> 13:16.000
And they love bonsai tree's.

13:16.083 --> 13:17.583
But it makes them sick.

13:17.667 --> 13:20.125
Great, so when Rudy sees
his beloved tree's been destroyed,

13:20.208 --> 13:21.166
he'll blame Ty.

13:21.250 --> 13:24.417
And when Ty's ants get sick,
he'll blame Rudy.

13:24.500 --> 13:27.125
Then Ty will want us
to leave this smelly dump.

13:27.208 --> 13:29.041
Uh, excuse me?

13:29.125 --> 13:31.792
Okay, this place happens to be...
Oh, no, you're right.

13:44.625 --> 13:45.542
They're coming.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.750
They're coming, they're coming!
They're coming.

13:47.834 --> 13:49.417
- Franklin.
- Sorry, dear.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.250
Hey, what's up, guys?

13:56.333 --> 13:58.500
You guys have a good time
dancing with the Delmonico twins?

13:59.375 --> 14:02.875
Uh, uh, you know, we were so excited
about the dance,

14:02.959 --> 14:03.834
we forgot to pick 'em up.

14:03.917 --> 14:05.667
I don't know how that happened.

14:08.333 --> 14:11.917
Ty! Your ants got out
and ate my beautiful bonsai.

14:12.458 --> 14:14.667
You must not have put the cover back on
when you fed them.

14:14.750 --> 14:16.834
Look how sick my ants are.

14:16.917 --> 14:18.250
They're swelling up with gas.

14:18.333 --> 14:20.250
They got the bonsai bloats.

14:22.041 --> 14:24.583
You, you!

14:24.667 --> 14:28.083
You have suffered an unimaginable loss.

14:28.166 --> 14:29.166
Huh?

14:29.250 --> 14:30.709
As have you.

14:30.792 --> 14:33.250
You know, it's times like these
that make you realize

14:33.333 --> 14:35.333
how important it is
to have such good friends.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.750
My poor ants.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.333
Their little ant bodies have no holes.

14:40.375 --> 14:41.625
So eventually they'll just...

14:41.709 --> 14:43.625
...pop!

14:46.375 --> 14:47.834
It's starting.

14:51.667 --> 14:53.208
Excuse me, everybody.

14:53.875 --> 14:56.333
To celebrate our first week together,

14:56.417 --> 14:59.166
Ty and I will be right back
with a little surprise.

14:59.250 --> 15:02.792
Although now it's not as much a surprise
because we just told you about it.

15:02.875 --> 15:04.917
But you still don't know it's a cake. Ha!

15:08.709 --> 15:10.041
I'll say it.

15:10.125 --> 15:11.750
I'm not crazy about the company.

15:12.583 --> 15:14.291
But Krupnicks love their crab legs.

15:19.041 --> 15:20.250
- Ah!
-

15:20.333 --> 15:23.250
You just hit me with that crab leg.
You're done, dork.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
You probably shouldn't have done that.

15:27.083 --> 15:29.250
But I'm actually glad you did.

15:32.083 --> 15:33.542
Let's just stay out of it.

15:34.250 --> 15:35.709
- Hon?
- That's it.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.375
How's that, hon?

16:19.500 --> 16:22.458
You know, I thought the kids were going to
have a hard time getting along,

16:22.542 --> 16:24.792
but I think they're really
following our example.

16:25.625 --> 16:26.917
Surprise!

16:29.917 --> 16:31.166
They started it.

16:33.166 --> 16:35.917
I have never been so disappointed.

16:36.750 --> 16:38.291
You people should be ashamed.

16:38.917 --> 16:41.875
You're going to pay for every
bit of damage that you caused.

16:42.291 --> 16:45.250
Does anyone have anything to say?

16:45.333 --> 16:46.208
I do.

16:47.959 --> 16:50.750
This raspberry lemon chiffon cake
is to die for.

16:52.417 --> 16:54.083
We should have this for our wedding, hon.

16:55.333 --> 16:56.583
Why wait?

17:01.625 --> 17:03.959
- Guys, Bobbington has had enough.
- Oh!

17:04.041 --> 17:05.667
You've already made him a paintball target

17:05.750 --> 17:07.625
- Ah!
- Jumped on him like a trampoline.

17:07.709 --> 17:10.500
- Ow!
- And turned him into a human piñata.

17:11.291 --> 17:13.709
About that the things that fell out of me,

17:13.792 --> 17:15.458
I'm going to need them back.

17:17.208 --> 17:19.834
Congrats, Sam.
You're one of the cool kids now.

17:20.667 --> 17:21.792
Thanks, Bobby.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.375
I just thought of something
that we could do

17:24.458 --> 17:26.375
with one of those electric catfish.

17:26.458 --> 17:27.834
Hey, Bobbington.

17:27.917 --> 17:29.750
Drop one down your pants.

17:31.166 --> 17:34.333
But each one is 1,000 slimy volts.

17:34.417 --> 17:38.083
Fish. Pants. Now!

17:43.041 --> 17:44.083
Very well.

17:58.083 --> 18:01.208
We are not putting an electric catfish
down Bobby's pants.

18:01.291 --> 18:03.417
Come on, Sam. He's just the butler.

18:04.583 --> 18:07.542
No, he's not.
He's a lot more than a butler.

18:07.625 --> 18:08.959
He's Bobby Wasabi!

18:09.041 --> 18:11.750
Millionaire, great martial artist,
once famous movie star.

18:11.834 --> 18:13.750
I'm still huge in France.

18:15.458 --> 18:17.125
And my best friend.

18:17.208 --> 18:18.917
He was helping me try to impress you.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.458
I don't want to be friends with you.

18:20.709 --> 18:22.041
Whatever, loser.

18:23.166 --> 18:24.625
We're out of here.

18:30.667 --> 18:31.792
I'm sorry, Bobby.

18:31.875 --> 18:33.875
I don't need friends like that. I got you.

18:33.959 --> 18:34.917
Hmm.

18:35.333 --> 18:38.750
You know Sam,
I am proud to be your friend.

18:41.375 --> 18:42.834
I better put him back.

18:45.875 --> 18:48.208
Get it off! Get it off!

18:53.208 --> 18:55.041
Thank you, friend.

19:03.750 --> 19:04.959
Everybody, listen up.

19:05.667 --> 19:07.083
Until you kids can get along,

19:07.166 --> 19:09.959
Rudy and I have decided
to give you the silent treatment.

19:10.041 --> 19:12.333
Uh, what's the silent treatment, you ask?

19:12.417 --> 19:14.917
It's when we say nothing to you.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.542
Not a single word, and it starts now.

19:19.709 --> 19:22.458
Hang on, there is one thing
that we did leave out.

19:22.542 --> 19:25.291
I, too, will be giving
the silent treatment.

19:25.917 --> 19:27.041
Starting now.

19:28.458 --> 19:29.333
No, I'm sorry I forgot.

19:29.375 --> 19:30.792
There's just one other thing
I need to say.

19:30.875 --> 19:32.375
Actually, you go ahead
then I have something after you.

19:32.417 --> 19:33.375
Guys.

19:34.041 --> 19:37.041
You know, we were thinking about it
and you guys were right.

19:37.125 --> 19:39.458
Yeah, you guys have been enemies
your entire lives.

19:39.542 --> 19:41.792
But you put your differences aside

19:41.875 --> 19:43.750
and we should have learned
from your example.

19:44.875 --> 19:47.750
And as a symbol of our two dojos
coming together in peace,

19:47.834 --> 19:48.834
we got you a gift.

19:48.917 --> 19:51.041
Be a monkey, be a monkey, be a monkey!

19:51.625 --> 19:53.875
Guys, come on. It's a ranking board.

19:54.291 --> 19:56.542
Oh! I always wanted one of these.

19:57.583 --> 20:00.333
- Come on, guys.
- Oh! Put your belts up there.

20:03.125 --> 20:05.834
Uh, Rudy, you put yours
on the top rung there, buddy.

20:05.917 --> 20:06.834
There you go.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.875
Yeah, of course, friend.

20:11.959 --> 20:13.375
Uh, when we were students,

20:13.500 --> 20:15.542
the Grandmaster gave me
the higher ranking.

20:15.625 --> 20:18.000
Uh, that is true, pal-o-mine.

20:18.083 --> 20:20.125
But last year at regionals,
I outranked you.

20:20.208 --> 20:22.875
That's because
you used an illegal sweep kick.

20:23.917 --> 20:24.917
That's it!

20:34.417 --> 20:35.917
So we go back to hating each other now?

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Absolutely.

20:37.083 --> 20:37.917
- Oh, yeah.
- Yep.

20:38.000 --> 20:38.959
Get out.

20:44.792 --> 20:46.583
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

20:53.125 --> 20:54.458
What are you doing here?

20:54.542 --> 20:56.375
I ran into the Delmonico twins.

20:56.375 --> 20:58.208
They were pretty upset
that we stood them up.

20:58.250 --> 21:00.875
I figured the least we could do
was give them one dance.

21:01.375 --> 21:02.667
I suppose you're right.

21:22.208 --> 21:24.834
Yee-hee! Yee-ha!

21:56.750 --> 21:57.667

22:01.917 --> 22:02.834
