00:04.484 --> 00:05.754
Hey, Calvin.

00:05.779 --> 00:07.660
Any news about Malcolm's job interview?

00:07.685 --> 00:10.056
Eh, not yet. Haven't heard anything.

00:10.081 --> 00:11.291
Oh, my God, it is killing me.

00:11.316 --> 00:12.861
I couldn't sleep a wink last night.

00:13.469 --> 00:15.504
I know. I got your texts

00:15.529 --> 00:17.994
at 2:00, 3:00 and 4:00 a.m.

00:19.066 --> 00:21.087
Look, I'm trying not to
worry about it too much.

00:21.112 --> 00:23.288
Oh, yeah, totally, duh.

00:23.590 --> 00:25.488
What was I thinking?

00:25.548 --> 00:27.750
But it has got to be killing you.

00:28.541 --> 00:30.422
I mean, it is an epic
story to be the father

00:30.447 --> 00:33.056
of a son who almost
made it to the majors,

00:33.110 --> 00:35.553
only to suffer a career-ending injury

00:35.578 --> 00:38.366
and then be rudderless for years.

00:39.510 --> 00:40.989
But now he's back.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.555
He's ready to carve out a path,

00:42.580 --> 00:44.345
but who knows doing what?

00:45.543 --> 00:46.998
You know, I never actually thought

00:47.023 --> 00:48.868
I'd hear myself say this, but...

00:49.062 --> 00:51.070
Dave, can we just talk about you?

00:51.741 --> 00:54.352
Oh, y-yeah, totally. Of-of course.

00:54.377 --> 00:55.585
What about me? Well...

00:55.610 --> 00:57.459
I'm just so nervous about Malcolm!

00:58.405 --> 00:59.513
Look.

01:00.001 --> 01:01.653
This is his first interview in a while.

01:01.678 --> 01:03.027
We're not even sure
if he's gonna get it.

01:03.052 --> 01:05.952
So, when he gets here,
let's just play it cool.

01:05.977 --> 01:06.967
- Yeah.
- All right?

01:06.992 --> 01:09.168
- Hey, guys.
- Did you get it?

01:09.454 --> 01:11.192
Did you get it? Come on, now.
Spit it out, boy.

01:11.217 --> 01:12.558
Pop. I got the job.

01:12.583 --> 01:14.185
- Yeah! All right.
- Yes!

01:14.210 --> 01:15.254
- Okay.
- Come on...

01:15.279 --> 01:17.176
Here we go.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.739
- Dave, excuse me.
- Oh.

01:21.793 --> 01:23.365
Gosh. I'm-I'm sorry.

01:23.390 --> 01:25.716
- All right.
- All right.

01:30.310 --> 01:33.646
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:34.908 --> 01:36.953
Hey, everybody. Listen to Malcolm.

01:37.274 --> 01:39.363
- Well, turns out...
- He got the job!

01:39.388 --> 01:42.736
Oh, my God! He got the job! Oh, baby!

01:42.761 --> 01:45.611
I am so proud of you. I
knew you could do it.

01:45.636 --> 01:47.425
Aw, thanks, Ma, I appreciate it.

01:47.450 --> 01:49.455
Yeah, man, congrats.

01:49.480 --> 01:51.405
Now you can pay me back
that 50 bucks you owe me.

01:51.453 --> 01:52.676
Man...

01:52.701 --> 01:54.297
But seriously, congrats.

01:54.322 --> 01:55.584
But seriously, 50 bucks.

01:55.609 --> 01:57.611
Get out of here, man.

01:57.933 --> 01:59.492
- This is big, Malcolm.
- Mm-hmm.

01:59.517 --> 02:01.291
I mean, you're putting
yourself back out there

02:01.316 --> 02:03.475
and years from now, you're
gonna look back on this day

02:03.500 --> 02:05.540
- as a turning point in your life.
- Mm-hmm.

02:05.565 --> 02:07.231
Look, I don't know, Pop,
y'all are making too big

02:07.256 --> 02:08.505
a deal out of this, man.

02:08.530 --> 02:10.628
I am selling TVs at
Powerhouse Electronics.

02:10.654 --> 02:12.779
I'm not pitching in the World Series.

02:12.804 --> 02:15.644
Look, son. I know this
is not your dream job.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.455
But it doesn't mean that this can't be

02:17.480 --> 02:19.856
a stepping stone to something real.

02:19.881 --> 02:22.275
I mean, with your smarts,
and your work ethic,

02:22.335 --> 02:23.779
in a couple years, you
could be working yourself

02:23.804 --> 02:25.223
up the corporate ladder.

02:25.248 --> 02:26.265
I don't know, Pop.

02:26.290 --> 02:27.918
I've never worked in sales before.

02:27.943 --> 02:29.292
Well, you're in luck.

02:29.419 --> 02:32.217
I mean, I've had my
auto shop for 30 years.

02:32.242 --> 02:35.311
I could teach you all
about the ABC's of sales.

02:35.549 --> 02:38.667
Always Be Calvin.

02:40.587 --> 02:41.782
You mean, be grouchy

02:41.807 --> 02:43.986
and always forget to put
the toilet seat down?

02:44.702 --> 02:46.182
N-No, babe.

02:46.207 --> 02:47.604
Be confident.

02:47.629 --> 02:48.955
- Be charming.
- Mm-hmm.

02:48.980 --> 02:51.156
And always make it about
the customer's needs.

02:51.181 --> 02:53.518
This customer

02:53.543 --> 02:55.517
really needs you to put
the toilet seat down.

02:57.385 --> 02:59.627
- Okay, babe.
- Okay.

03:00.173 --> 03:02.111
Look, I'm-a show you how
it's done, all right?

03:02.136 --> 03:02.915
- Marty.
- All right.

03:02.940 --> 03:04.333
- Huh?
- Pretend to be a customer.

03:04.358 --> 03:05.898
Oh, sure.

03:05.923 --> 03:08.175
Excuse me, sir. Do you work here?

03:08.200 --> 03:10.025
Why yes, I do.

03:12.650 --> 03:14.074
How can I help you?

03:14.099 --> 03:15.691
Oh, well, you may want to know

03:15.716 --> 03:16.939
that I was just in the bathroom

03:16.964 --> 03:19.239
and somebody left the toilet seat up.

03:23.103 --> 03:25.892
Well, perhaps you have a
question about televisions.

03:25.917 --> 03:28.530
As a matter of fact, I do.

03:28.555 --> 03:31.522
Does this model have
VGA and HDMI inputs?

03:31.547 --> 03:33.870
And can it handle both
NTSC and PAL frame rates?

03:33.895 --> 03:35.398
'Cause I don't want to
be region-locked on a 4K

03:35.423 --> 03:36.670
when 8Ks are right around the corner.

03:36.695 --> 03:38.882
You know what I'm saying, big dog?

03:40.055 --> 03:42.759
I'll handle this, bro. Why don't
you go check on them toilets.

03:46.247 --> 03:48.993
I love that we're
afternoon friends now.

03:49.018 --> 03:50.901
Yeah, yeah, I know,

03:50.926 --> 03:53.111
but when you said that we
would be day drinking,

03:53.136 --> 03:55.772
this is not exactly what I had in mind.

03:57.351 --> 04:00.634
Ooh, Gemma, this Earl Grey
tastes like Chardonnay.

04:00.659 --> 04:02.628
The tea cup makes me feel less guilty.

04:04.842 --> 04:07.107
So I see you guys got a piano.
Who plays?

04:07.242 --> 04:08.789
Grover started taking lessons,

04:08.814 --> 04:11.705
but he's not really that into it.
He doesn't like his teacher.

04:11.901 --> 04:14.055
See, there's your problem right there.

04:14.080 --> 04:17.922
When teaching piano,
you have to have fun.

04:22.310 --> 04:24.656
I didn't know you played.

04:24.681 --> 04:27.242
Yeah, I started when I
was about Grover's age.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.918
My mom was the church organist.
I used to sit next to her

04:29.943 --> 04:32.075
while she'd teach me how
to play gospel songs,

04:32.100 --> 04:34.338
but she would add curse
words in it to make it fun.

04:34.882 --> 04:38.819
Like "hell-elujah"?

04:39.344 --> 04:41.133
Gemma, that's blasphemous.

04:42.532 --> 04:45.210
Well, I hope Grover can be
as good as you someday.

04:45.235 --> 04:47.367
Do you know any fun piano teachers?

04:47.392 --> 04:49.466
Well, I know the most fun one of all...

04:49.639 --> 04:52.019
me.

04:52.821 --> 04:55.442
Oh, my God, that would be so great.

04:55.549 --> 04:57.231
But, are you sure it's
not an imposition?

04:57.256 --> 05:00.973
No, not at all. I'll put up with
a lot for 50 bucks an hour.

05:04.098 --> 05:08.004
Oh, man, look at the size of these TVs.

05:08.182 --> 05:09.401
I know.

05:09.426 --> 05:12.366
My first TV, the screen was this big.

05:12.391 --> 05:15.013
- My first TV was black and white.
- Huh.

05:15.038 --> 05:16.910
Kind of like you and me.

05:17.543 --> 05:20.029
Yeah, except I can't turn you off.

05:23.293 --> 05:24.897
What are you guys doing here?

05:24.922 --> 05:27.038
Well, your dad just wanted
to see you in action.

05:27.063 --> 05:28.669
Yeah, and I was halfway
down the driveway

05:28.694 --> 05:31.384
when Dave jumped in
the back of my truck.

05:31.906 --> 05:34.127
Well, I appreciate you guys
coming out to support me,

05:34.152 --> 05:35.865
but, uh, I'm on the clock.

05:35.890 --> 05:39.346
Oh, look how professional he is.

05:39.755 --> 05:43.449
Yeah, got his shirt all
tucked in and his khakis.

05:45.384 --> 05:48.011
Hi there. Are you gentlemen
being taken care of?

05:48.036 --> 05:49.496
Are you kidding?

05:49.737 --> 05:53.165
This is the most impressive
salesman I've ever met.

05:53.190 --> 05:54.899
I mean, tell me the truth,

05:54.924 --> 05:57.849
how many times has he been
employee of the month?

05:58.208 --> 06:00.443
Uh, well, actually,
this is his first day.

06:00.468 --> 06:02.911
- What?
- What?

06:03.186 --> 06:05.843
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

06:05.868 --> 06:09.151
Well, you know, you have
one heck of a salesman

06:09.176 --> 06:10.737
here in, uh...

06:11.523 --> 06:13.412
- Malcolm.
- Yeah.

06:13.445 --> 06:16.192
Let me guess, these are your dads?

06:17.521 --> 06:19.665
Yup. They sure are.

06:19.873 --> 06:23.261
Oh, no, we are not. I'm his dad.

06:23.286 --> 06:26.679
And I'm his neighbor,
but we're best friends.

06:30.083 --> 06:31.977
Okay, well, if you don't mind,

06:32.002 --> 06:33.831
there's a lady over there
who's actually interested

06:33.856 --> 06:36.966
- in buying something.
- Oh, please.

06:38.656 --> 06:40.904
Can you believe that guy

06:40.929 --> 06:43.062
actually thought we were a couple?

06:43.571 --> 06:45.833
Please, you could do worse.

06:49.404 --> 06:52.272
Okay, Grover, I guarantee
you this piano lesson

06:52.297 --> 06:54.087
is gonna be a lot more fun.

06:54.387 --> 06:55.867
How do you know?

06:55.892 --> 06:57.851
Because I've already had my tea.

06:59.148 --> 07:00.497
Now, the first step

07:00.541 --> 07:02.497
is to visualize your audience.

07:03.007 --> 07:04.227
I like to imagine

07:04.252 --> 07:06.509
that I'm walking on stage

07:06.791 --> 07:08.959
at the Apollo Theater.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.340
Oh, oh, thank you.

07:12.691 --> 07:15.074
Oh, thank you.

07:15.118 --> 07:17.300
Oh, hello.

07:17.941 --> 07:21.129
- Who are you waving at?
- Quincy Jones.

07:21.539 --> 07:24.281
- Who's that?
- Just a guy I used to date.

07:24.693 --> 07:26.632
Okay, now-now, come on, show me

07:26.657 --> 07:28.704
how you're gonna walk onto the stage.

07:32.011 --> 07:33.614
Hi, Mom.

07:34.117 --> 07:37.233
Oh, come on, Grove, that's all you got?

07:37.258 --> 07:38.907
Listen, these imaginary people

07:38.932 --> 07:41.174
paid a lot of money to come see you.

07:41.199 --> 07:43.826
Now strut your stuff, man. Come on.

07:44.807 --> 07:46.331
Uh-huh, okay.

07:46.356 --> 07:47.749
That's good.

07:48.412 --> 07:50.838
Okay. Get it.

07:50.863 --> 07:52.542
Oh, okay.

07:53.485 --> 07:55.969
All right, all right.

07:56.374 --> 07:59.667
Little rock star, you haven't
dropped the album as of yet.

08:00.169 --> 08:03.477
Now, most teachers teach
you how to play music.

08:03.502 --> 08:05.789
I'm gonna teach you how to feel music.

08:06.013 --> 08:07.873
Tell me how this makes you feel.

08:13.913 --> 08:16.572
- Scared.
- Mm.

08:16.597 --> 08:19.267
Like getting your credit
ran at a furniture store.

08:21.604 --> 08:23.480
Now how about this?

08:27.402 --> 08:29.576
- Happy?
- Oh!

08:29.601 --> 08:30.540
Like getting your credit approved,

08:30.565 --> 08:32.061
now you can get that waterbed!

08:34.624 --> 08:37.672
Can I just go back to
waving at my fans now?

08:37.883 --> 08:39.677
Yeah, but they're not
gonna cheer you on

08:39.702 --> 08:41.782
unless you play something, baby.

08:41.914 --> 08:43.735
- You're right.
- Yeah.

08:43.760 --> 08:46.499
Good thing our piano
has this demo button.

08:53.901 --> 08:58.182
Okay, mama's gonna need some more tea.
I'll be back.

09:00.758 --> 09:02.367
Hey, Trevor, you wanted to see me?

09:02.392 --> 09:03.797
Yeah, come on in.

09:03.822 --> 09:07.328
I was looking over the receipts,
and you sold four TVs today?

09:07.551 --> 09:08.864
Is that a good thing?

09:08.889 --> 09:10.766
Yeah, yeah, four TVs is great.

09:10.791 --> 09:13.353
Thank God. Man, I thought
I was in trouble.

09:13.378 --> 09:14.848
Oh, you are.

09:16.053 --> 09:18.736
Does it have something to
do with one of my two dads?

09:18.761 --> 09:21.141
Malcolm, it's great
that you sold four TVs,

09:21.166 --> 09:23.517
but we make our real
money on peripherals.

09:23.542 --> 09:26.814
You know, cables, warranties,
home installations.

09:26.839 --> 09:29.136
Yeah, I offered that to
all of my customers,

09:29.161 --> 09:30.554
but nobody was interested.

09:30.579 --> 09:33.245
Then you have to convince
people that they need them.

09:33.270 --> 09:35.666
Like that little old lady
you sold to earlier.

09:35.691 --> 09:37.931
If you had told her she
needed a warranty,

09:37.956 --> 09:39.089
she would've bought it.

09:39.114 --> 09:42.659
She was 80 years old, man. She
didn't need a 15-year warranty.

09:44.234 --> 09:47.304
Then why didn't you sign her up
for our in-store credit card?

09:47.329 --> 09:48.612
With 18% interest?

09:48.637 --> 09:50.866
Exactly. See, that's how
we really get them.

09:51.755 --> 09:54.056
Now go back out there
and make me proud.

09:54.081 --> 09:56.784
Oh, and push the 65-inch Hamagakis.

09:56.809 --> 09:58.906
They're about to be
recalled for exploding.

09:59.339 --> 10:02.024
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, Trevor,
I don't think I'm comfortable

10:02.049 --> 10:04.101
selling people stuff
they don't need, man,

10:04.204 --> 10:06.514
or that should come with
a fire extinguisher.

10:07.062 --> 10:09.274
Okay, got it. Totally understand.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.187
- Cool.
- You're fired.

10:11.212 --> 10:12.680
What?

10:12.820 --> 10:15.536
Look, man, clearly you're a good guy.

10:15.561 --> 10:17.733
If I knew that, I
wouldn't have hired you.

10:18.058 --> 10:20.240
Hold on, let's not be
too hasty, all right.

10:20.265 --> 10:23.124
I am not such a good guy.
I can do much worse.

10:23.391 --> 10:26.371
Mm, nah, man, not buying it. I
feel like you're lying to me,

10:26.396 --> 10:28.499
which is good, but too late.

10:29.609 --> 10:31.163
All right, fine.

10:31.206 --> 10:33.801
But I hope one of them Hamagakis
blows up in your face.

10:33.837 --> 10:35.268
No, you don't.

10:35.293 --> 10:37.286
Damn, you're right. I don't.

10:39.000 --> 10:45.074

10:48.647 --> 10:50.954
Congratulations! Congratulations!

10:51.041 --> 10:53.915
You did it!

11:00.976 --> 11:02.478
Sorry about that.

11:02.595 --> 11:05.204
Probably should've thrown
that from farther away.

11:06.765 --> 11:08.352
Uh, wow, guys.

11:08.377 --> 11:10.104
You shouldn't have.

11:10.129 --> 11:11.810
You really shouldn't have.

11:12.499 --> 11:13.849
Yeah, man. I agree.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.384
It's just your first day.
And some of us

11:15.409 --> 11:17.304
have been employed for years, you know,

11:17.329 --> 11:19.760
as a rocket scientist.

11:20.471 --> 11:22.547
Have you ever sold anybody a rocket?

11:22.931 --> 11:25.038
Daddy, that's not how it works, man.

11:27.450 --> 11:29.582
We're just so happy for you.

11:29.607 --> 11:31.406
Yeah. Way to go, Malcolm.

11:31.431 --> 11:32.985
- Oh.
- Aw.

11:33.316 --> 11:35.062
Hey, thanks, little man.

11:35.087 --> 11:38.020
Son, you know I've been hard on you

11:38.045 --> 11:39.805
these last couple years, but...

11:39.830 --> 11:41.693
seeing you at work today,

11:41.718 --> 11:43.357
I'm proud of you, son.

11:44.368 --> 11:46.110
So, how was your first day?

11:46.301 --> 11:47.781
It was, um...

11:47.806 --> 11:48.984
unbelievable.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.538
Yeah, it was!

11:50.563 --> 11:52.475
All right!

11:58.280 --> 12:01.239
Come on, son. Everybody wants
to hear about your day.

12:01.283 --> 12:03.067
Um, you know, Pop, I, um...

12:03.110 --> 12:05.156
I sold some stuff, people
bought some stuff,

12:05.200 --> 12:08.242
and then I talked to my boss
about my future at the company.

12:08.472 --> 12:10.345
See, that's what I'm
talking about right there.

12:10.370 --> 12:11.325
See?

12:11.350 --> 12:12.826
Does anybody want to hear about my day?

12:13.056 --> 12:15.806
Today, my satellite
discovered a new supernova.

12:15.831 --> 12:17.175
Okay, not now, Marty. Listen,

12:17.200 --> 12:18.487
um...

12:18.847 --> 12:21.066
so, did you use any of my techniques?

12:21.091 --> 12:23.050
Uh, every single one of 'em, Pop.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.501
That's my boy right there.

12:24.526 --> 12:26.262
Just sayin',

12:26.287 --> 12:28.226
I am also your boy.

12:29.041 --> 12:30.421
So, did you

12:30.446 --> 12:32.418
use any of my techniques today?

12:33.037 --> 12:35.245
Well, I repositioned a
telemetry transponder

12:35.270 --> 12:37.011
from 60 million miles away.

12:37.303 --> 12:38.969
So all I'm hearing is "no."

12:42.324 --> 12:44.952
So, Grover said his piano
lesson went great.

12:44.977 --> 12:47.067
Ah. Yeah, he danced for five minutes,

12:47.092 --> 12:49.266
gave me his autograph, and then quit.

12:49.636 --> 12:51.290
What? He quit?

12:51.315 --> 12:52.830
Yeah. He dropped the mic,

12:52.855 --> 12:54.813
threw two fingers to the sky, and said,

12:54.857 --> 12:57.786
"Peace out, Pasadena! Grover
has left the building!"

12:58.534 --> 13:00.824
No, he can't quit.

13:00.849 --> 13:02.448
I stopped taking lessons
when I was his age,

13:02.473 --> 13:04.689
and I've regretted it ever since.

13:04.714 --> 13:06.766
Oh, wow. I didn't know
you wanted to play.

13:06.946 --> 13:09.340
Yeah.

13:09.365 --> 13:12.176
I have this fantasy where
I'm at a boring party,

13:12.201 --> 13:14.282
but there's a piano across the room.

13:14.307 --> 13:15.497
The crowd parts.

13:15.522 --> 13:16.994
I float over to it

13:17.019 --> 13:19.093
and start tickling those ivories.

13:19.118 --> 13:20.424
Next thing you know,

13:20.449 --> 13:22.286
there's a crowd gathered
around me making requests.

13:22.311 --> 13:24.052
And for some reason, Brad
Pitt is sitting next to me

13:24.077 --> 13:25.784
with his shirt off.

13:27.575 --> 13:29.312
So, you're making Grover take lessons

13:29.337 --> 13:31.912
because you regret giving it up.

13:32.797 --> 13:34.578
Well, yeah.

13:35.820 --> 13:37.981
Isn't living vicariously
through our kids

13:38.006 --> 13:40.344
half the reason why we have
them in the first place?

13:40.946 --> 13:42.611
Why don't you stop forcing Grover

13:42.636 --> 13:44.507
to do something he doesn't want to do

13:44.532 --> 13:46.732
and let me give you lessons instead?

13:46.757 --> 13:49.499
Oh, I don't know. It seems like
it's too late to start now.

13:49.524 --> 13:51.073
You're right. You're getting old.

13:51.098 --> 13:52.086
You might break a hip.

13:53.811 --> 13:55.735
Okay, fine. I'll give it a shot.

13:55.760 --> 13:57.424
Okay. Oh. And for the record,

13:57.449 --> 13:59.015
which Brad Pitt are we talking about?

13:59.040 --> 14:00.054
Fight ClubBrad.

14:00.079 --> 14:01.789
Ooh! That's a good Brad.

14:07.499 --> 14:09.017
Malcolm?

14:09.042 --> 14:11.208
Oh, hey, Dave. What's up?

14:11.233 --> 14:13.722
Hey, what are you doing here? I
thought you had work today...

14:15.200 --> 14:16.629
Oh, no.

14:16.654 --> 14:18.806
Look, Dave, I can explain, man.

14:18.831 --> 14:20.640
I just realized that if I had
been wearing a suit, too,

14:20.665 --> 14:23.327
we would look just like Men in Black.

14:25.385 --> 14:28.369
Yep, that is a missed
opportunity, Dave.

14:30.234 --> 14:31.987
Wait, are these job applications?

14:32.505 --> 14:35.180
Yeah. Look, the truth is,

14:35.439 --> 14:38.359
- I got fired yesterday, man.
- What? Why?

14:38.384 --> 14:40.400
Because they wanted me
to do some sleazy stuff

14:40.425 --> 14:42.107
that I wasn't comfortable with.

14:42.132 --> 14:43.602
Whoa.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.544
You mean, like, sex stuff?

14:47.176 --> 14:50.843
No, man. No, I mean, like,
ripping off old ladies.

14:50.868 --> 14:52.432
Oh... whoa.

14:52.457 --> 14:54.218
Well, that's bad, too.

14:57.535 --> 14:59.002
What'd your dad say?

14:59.027 --> 15:02.204
I haven't told him yet. I
mean, you saw him yesterday.

15:02.229 --> 15:04.856
He hasn't looked at me like that
since I was playing ball, man.

15:04.881 --> 15:06.648
He was in a pretty great mood.

15:06.673 --> 15:07.788
You know, after we left your store,

15:07.813 --> 15:09.528
all he wanted to do was
hang out together.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.420
We even split a giant pretzel.

15:13.058 --> 15:14.953
Wait, he split one with you?

15:14.978 --> 15:16.778
Not evenly.

15:17.803 --> 15:19.588
Yeah, well, I can't believe

15:19.613 --> 15:22.703
I finally landed a job and
get fired on my first day.

15:22.728 --> 15:24.131
That's humiliating.

15:24.156 --> 15:26.046
Well, you know what?
Maybe it's a good thing.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.113
You don't want to be stuck in a job

15:28.138 --> 15:29.864
that goes against your morals.

15:29.889 --> 15:31.661
Yeah, but I got to do something.

15:31.686 --> 15:35.994
You will. You're a smart,
hardworking good guy.

15:36.210 --> 15:37.756
A-And I'm not just saying that

15:37.781 --> 15:39.958
because I'm one of your two dads.

15:42.834 --> 15:45.272
Oh, hey, Calvin. You going somewhere?

15:45.297 --> 15:47.079
You know, I thought I'd
surprise Malcolm at work

15:47.104 --> 15:48.922
and take him out to lunch.

15:48.947 --> 15:50.967
Uh... d-don't do that.

15:52.055 --> 15:53.753
Why not?

15:53.778 --> 15:56.960
'Cause I was thinking, we had
such a nice time yesterday,

15:56.985 --> 16:01.553
maybe... maybe we should go
try a pretzel someplace else.

16:02.769 --> 16:05.641
You know, maybe do a little
Pasadena pretzel crawl.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.813
That's a hard pass, Dave.

16:09.064 --> 16:11.284
Hey, but, uh, bring me home one.

16:12.789 --> 16:15.581
All right, well, you got it.

16:15.606 --> 16:17.183
All right, well, you have a good time.

16:18.084 --> 16:20.609
Bye, now. We'll see you later.

16:23.860 --> 16:26.536
Uh... yeah, hey, M-Malcolm.
Yeah, it's Dave.

16:26.561 --> 16:28.882
Your dad is on his way to the store.

16:29.382 --> 16:31.514
No, no, I didn't tell him anything.

16:31.539 --> 16:33.056
I tried to stop him, but apparently,

16:33.081 --> 16:35.529
I made more of our pretzel
experience than he did,

16:35.554 --> 16:38.748
which totally backfired, 'cause
now I got to go get him one.

16:44.678 --> 16:46.467
Hey, Pop. Oh.

16:47.231 --> 16:48.406
Hey. Hey, there you are, man.

16:48.431 --> 16:49.780
I've been looking all over for you.

16:49.805 --> 16:51.087
Yeah, yeah, I was, uh...

16:51.112 --> 16:52.498
I was back there in a meeting.

16:52.523 --> 16:54.543
Mm, must be very important.

16:54.568 --> 16:57.118
- I see you got your suit on.
- Yeah.

16:57.143 --> 16:59.319
Uh... are they talking about
making you manager already?

16:59.344 --> 17:00.773
Oh, well, they definitely
said I wouldn't be

17:00.798 --> 17:02.538
in this position long.

17:03.999 --> 17:06.684
All right. Well, I just came
by to take you out to lunch.

17:06.709 --> 17:09.353
Oh, great, man, I'm starving.
Let's go right now.

17:09.377 --> 17:11.814
Oh, hold on. Don't you have to
check with your boss first?

17:11.839 --> 17:14.204
No, no. After our talk yesterday,

17:14.229 --> 17:16.515
I pretty much make up my own hours.

17:17.205 --> 17:20.156
Well, all right. That's good
right there. But you know what?

17:20.182 --> 17:21.373
Before we go,

17:21.397 --> 17:23.020
I've been thinking about
taking a look at some

17:23.045 --> 17:24.202
of these flat-screens right here,

17:24.227 --> 17:26.180
take advantage of that
employee discount.

17:26.204 --> 17:27.665
Oh, hey, Pop.

17:27.691 --> 17:29.497
Pop, you don't need a new TV, man.

17:29.522 --> 17:30.914
You know what you need?

17:30.939 --> 17:32.494
Uh... this.

17:32.638 --> 17:34.681
- A baby monitor?
- Yup. Yeah.

17:34.706 --> 17:36.441
I-It doesn't just monitor babies.

17:36.615 --> 17:38.392
You can listen to what
mom says about you

17:38.417 --> 17:40.798
when you're not around. Huh?

17:40.864 --> 17:43.330
It would be nice to hear
all those compliments.

17:43.355 --> 17:46.023
All right. That is great.

17:46.048 --> 17:47.369
I will ring it up for you

17:47.394 --> 17:50.173
and bring it home after my shift.
Let's go.

17:50.373 --> 17:51.983
Malcolm.

17:52.165 --> 17:53.697
What are you doing here?

17:53.721 --> 17:54.845
Uh, nothing. Uh, uh,

17:54.870 --> 17:56.720
just going out to lunch with my dad.

17:56.954 --> 17:58.322
H-Hold on. What,

17:58.347 --> 18:00.131
what does he mean by, "What
are you doing here?"

18:00.156 --> 18:02.533
I mean he doesn't work here anymore.

18:03.670 --> 18:05.047
What?

18:05.281 --> 18:06.930
I got fired yesterday, Pop.

18:06.955 --> 18:09.968
Fired? How is that even possible?

18:09.993 --> 18:11.516
I mean, how bad do you
have to be at something

18:11.541 --> 18:13.916
to get fired on your first damn day?

18:14.303 --> 18:15.959
Pretty bad, actually.

18:17.021 --> 18:19.100
He refused to do the job.

18:19.474 --> 18:20.904
Damn it, Malcolm.

18:20.947 --> 18:22.832
I mean, how can you
refuse to do anything?

18:22.857 --> 18:25.604
What I refused to do was
rip people off, Pop,

18:25.629 --> 18:27.750
and sell exploding TVs to old ladies.

18:27.775 --> 18:30.161
Hey, you could've sold
those TVs to anyone.

18:30.776 --> 18:35.046
Oh, h-hold on, now. You wanted
him to sell exploding TVs?

18:35.071 --> 18:38.224
Yes, but with an extended warranty.
I'm not a monster.

18:39.154 --> 18:42.152
All right, look, Pop, man, I
want you to be proud of me,

18:42.177 --> 18:44.290
but not if that means I
can't be proud of myself.

18:44.315 --> 18:46.370
Look, man, don't overthink it.

18:46.395 --> 18:48.816
Some people just aren't
cut out for success.

18:48.841 --> 18:51.747
Oh, oh, oh. Hold on, now.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.015
My son is gonna be a success.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.559
Because he has integrity

18:55.584 --> 18:57.277
and heart and principles,

18:57.302 --> 19:00.175
and that's why I know my son
is gonna rise to the top.

19:00.200 --> 19:03.206
He's not gonna be some
bottom-feeder like you.

19:04.884 --> 19:06.378
All right, whatever.

19:07.107 --> 19:09.738
I just came out of my office to chat up

19:09.763 --> 19:12.988
that hot pregnant lady I saw
on the security camera.

19:13.013 --> 19:14.554
Bye.

19:16.767 --> 19:18.537
Dude's a jackass.

19:19.053 --> 19:21.454
Yeah, look, Pop, I was gonna
tell you the truth, man,

19:21.479 --> 19:23.874
but I just wanted to
find another job first.

19:24.212 --> 19:25.689
Look, man,

19:25.714 --> 19:27.785
I know I put a lot of pressure on you,

19:27.810 --> 19:30.704
but you never have to lie to me
about doing the right thing.

19:31.277 --> 19:33.583
Cool. Thanks, Pop.

19:33.608 --> 19:36.041
All right. So how about
we get that lunch?

19:36.066 --> 19:38.222
Sounds good to me. Where we going?

19:38.403 --> 19:40.799
First restaurant we see
with a "help wanted" sign.

19:49.299 --> 19:50.882
How's it going, Mom?

19:50.907 --> 19:54.178
Uh, okay, but it's
harder than I thought.

19:54.203 --> 19:56.275
Maybe you should have some tea.

19:58.144 --> 20:00.364
Miss Tina says it makes
everything better.

20:02.267 --> 20:04.427
What else did Miss Tina teach you?

20:04.452 --> 20:06.734
Well, she taught me to always start

20:06.759 --> 20:08.344
by waving to your audience.

20:08.630 --> 20:10.442
Hey, Quincy.

20:11.909 --> 20:14.141
Now, let's start with a simple scale.

20:14.166 --> 20:15.545
Okay.

20:22.541 --> 20:25.138
Grover, that's really good.

20:25.163 --> 20:27.253
I thought you didn't
like playing piano.

20:27.328 --> 20:31.427
I didn't. But I think maybe
I like playing with you.

20:32.947 --> 20:36.121
Well, we could take lessons
from Miss Tina together.

20:36.146 --> 20:37.712
That sounds fun.

20:37.974 --> 20:40.361
But first, let's give
some love to our fans.

20:40.386 --> 20:41.588
Yeah.

20:45.765 --> 20:47.255
Who are you waving at?

20:47.280 --> 20:49.412
Oh, just this guy named Brad.
