She's staying with me now.

- You know that, right?
- Yeah. That's good.

She needs a place she can feel safe.

13:07.253 --> 13:08.971

the way it was.

No, it's not a good time, Connor,
after everything she's been through.

- Oh, Angel.

meeting you again.

...but it was just too much.

15:00.453 --> 15:01.772
Tell me what?

15:03.293 --> 15:06.330
What I remembered when
I was a higher being.

15:08.293 --> 15:10.409
I remember seeing you.

15:11.293 --> 15:14.330
Your past, when you were Angelus.

15:18.293 --> 15:22.650
I never tried to hide who I was
or what I've done.

15:23.693 --> 15:25.524
You already knew.

15:26.853 --> 15:29.128
Knowing's different than living it.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.884
When I was up there,
I could look back...

15:33.053 --> 15:36.887
...and see everything you ever did
as Angelus.

15:37.133 --> 15:39.442
More than see.

15:39.613 --> 15:40.682
I felt it.

15:41.773 --> 15:44.606
Not just their fear and pain.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.962
I felt you...

15:48.893 --> 15:51.851
...and how much you enjoyed
making them suffer.

15:57.453 --> 15:59.762
I love you, Angel.

16:01.653 --> 16:03.405
But I can't be with you.

that could give us a location?

17:05.893 --> 17:08.771
No, just a big beastie.

- No, I...

- Nobody's seen her.

Maybe she ducked and covered when
our feathered friends went kamikaze.

drive around, see if I can...

- You can do that?

28:10.053 --> 28:12.772
No, but it sounds comforting,
and I could use the air.

It is a bit ripe in here.

28:17.533 --> 28:20.491

- Fred's not here.

- Didn't ask.
- Didn't have to.

- Not your business.

could save the three rounds...

plague-a-thon ends.

28:31.853 --> 28:34.128
You've noticed an increase
in paranormal activity.

28:34.333 --> 28:35.925
You stepped in some on your way in.

28:36.133 --> 28:39.523
Birds, rats, blood. The Ghostbuster lines
have been ringing off the hook.

If we don't stop what's coming, it won't
matter where Fred is or any of us.

28:56.333 --> 28:58.722
That's everything Wolfram and Hart
could decipher...

...from what they took out of Lorne.
- They just handed these over?

29:02.373 --> 29:05.809
- Lilah, she can be very giving.
GUNN: You trust her on this?

29:05.973 --> 29:09.329

in stopping the end of the world...

end of the world...

29:12.173 --> 29:14.084

then do something large and violent.

29:17.333 --> 29:19.483
I see you've given it
considerable thought.

29:19.693 --> 29:22.730
So all this came out of my head?
No wonder it made me greener.

29:22.893 --> 29:26.329

you'd be a paler shade of dead.

seeing, the answers are in these pages.

- We have to keep trying.

Normally, I'd agree,
but this is a waste of time.

WESLEY: Something's missing.

languages, symbols, all jumbled together.

Um, "heat, fallen, shrine, flesh."

- We gotta keep at it till it does.

- We should take a step back.

it's going down now.
