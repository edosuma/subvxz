WEBVTT

00:01.459 --> 00:03.920
Mistress:
Previously on "The Outpost"...

00:03.962 --> 00:06.297
Yavalla can't have taken control
of the Capital already.

00:06.339 --> 00:10.176
Strip her of her adornments
and lock her in the prison.

00:10.218 --> 00:12.178
The Three have now
been replaced by the One,

00:12.220 --> 00:15.557
- and her name is Yavalla.
- ( gasping )

00:15.598 --> 00:17.809
We've come all this way
for sanctuary from the plague.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.936
But you can't come in.
Not unless you, um,

00:19.978 --> 00:21.646
renounce your allegiance
to the Prime Order.

00:21.688 --> 00:23.815
We present ourselves as men
with no allegiance.

00:23.857 --> 00:24.941
Open the gate.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.320
( all screaming )

00:29.362 --> 00:32.490
- One.
- I'm now overlord
of this Outpost.

00:32.532 --> 00:34.659
Talon:
She's dying, Garret.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.542
Talon:
Gwynn looks bad.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.004
Garret: We don't
know how many times

00:46.046 --> 00:47.672
she can pass her kinj
before it kills her.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.300
- We can't wait long.
- Zed: Wait for my distraction

00:50.341 --> 00:51.676
to draw the rest
of the guards,

00:51.718 --> 00:54.262
and then grab Rosmund.

00:54.304 --> 00:55.889
Don't wait for me.

00:55.930 --> 00:57.891
I'll see you back
at the Outpost.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.863
( groaning )

01:11.905 --> 01:14.407
Talon:
We should do something.

01:14.449 --> 01:15.867
Garret:
What can we do?

01:23.041 --> 01:25.710
Go on.
You were chosen.

01:25.752 --> 01:28.004
This is a chance
to be one with your queen.

01:39.099 --> 01:42.644
Don't be afraid.
Take my hand.

01:58.993 --> 02:00.954
Thank you, Your Highness.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.250
Can't bloody move
in this stuff.

02:27.272 --> 02:28.439
( grunting )

02:54.215 --> 02:55.383
( guard roars )

03:02.265 --> 03:04.475
Yavalla, you witch,
where are you?

03:04.517 --> 03:06.477
( grunting )

03:06.519 --> 03:09.898
Zed, you certainly don't
give up easily, do you?

03:09.939 --> 03:13.234
What could you possibly
wish to accomplish?

03:13.276 --> 03:17.030
One thing only.
To find and destroy you.

03:17.071 --> 03:18.865
- Where are you?
- ( chuckles )

03:18.907 --> 03:20.617
You can't even find me.

04:02.909 --> 04:06.162
( theme music playing )

04:17.131 --> 04:19.425
Yavalla. Yavalla.

04:19.467 --> 04:21.052
Yavalla's shrine is on fire.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.221
- ( crowd gasping )
- That was fast.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.723
Go on! There's a fire!
Put it out!

04:25.765 --> 04:28.685
Who would do such a thing?

04:28.726 --> 04:30.228
Help me get the Queen
to her chambers.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.230
No. We must see
if anyone is hurt.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.439
We have to make sure
you're safe first.

04:33.481 --> 04:34.857
Garret:
What are you waiting for?

04:34.899 --> 04:37.860
The two of us will guard
the Queen. Go! Go!

04:39.737 --> 04:41.656
( both grunting )

04:41.698 --> 04:44.784
What is the meaning of this?

04:44.826 --> 04:46.869
- I am your Queen.
- Talon: Where are The Three?

04:46.911 --> 04:48.871
Gwynn:
Two was taken to jail
when we first arrived.

04:48.913 --> 04:52.542
Is that who you work for?

04:52.583 --> 04:53.876
What's the fastest way
to the prison?

04:53.918 --> 04:55.545
I know a way.

04:57.380 --> 05:00.883
We'll take over here.
You two go help.

05:03.553 --> 05:07.390
- Man: What have you here?
- Garret: See for yourself.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.645
( grunts )

05:12.687 --> 05:13.604
What? No!

05:17.942 --> 05:18.860
In here.

05:25.783 --> 05:27.535
Can you handle Gwynn?

05:34.959 --> 05:36.085
Do you want me
to take both of them?

05:36.127 --> 05:37.795
( grunts )

05:48.097 --> 05:52.435
- ( grunting )
- Come on, pointy-ears,
you fight like babies.

05:52.477 --> 05:55.480
I want to see blood.

06:06.240 --> 06:09.911
I said to the death,
you pointy-eared scum.

06:09.952 --> 06:12.538
One of you Blackbloods dies
or you both do.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.874
Who's it gonna be?

06:14.916 --> 06:16.834
- ( grunts )
- ( crowd gasping )

06:18.252 --> 06:22.006
Get in there
and clean up the ring.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.175
Why are you doing this?

06:24.217 --> 06:26.511
I'm gonna kill
all the pointy-ears anyway.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.763
Might as well make sport of it,
don't you think?

06:28.805 --> 06:31.974
No. No, I don't think.

06:32.016 --> 06:36.145
Taste that, gate boy,
so I know it's not poisoned.

06:36.187 --> 06:38.314
Happily. I'm starving.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.360
Can I taste something
for you, too?

06:46.614 --> 06:48.908
Get two more in the ring.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.420
Look at this beautiful lassie.

07:00.461 --> 07:03.631
Come. Sit with me.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.591
You leave her alone.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.845
- ( groaning )
- Stop!

07:08.886 --> 07:12.932
- Munt! Munt.
- Stop! Stop, stop!

07:12.974 --> 07:15.393
- Please stop!
- Munt!

07:15.435 --> 07:18.479
I'll stay with you.
I'll stay with you.

07:20.314 --> 07:22.233
( groaning )

07:22.275 --> 07:24.777
If you hurt Munt again,
I will no longer serve you

07:24.819 --> 07:26.654
and your detestable men,
do you hear me?

07:26.696 --> 07:30.408
Well, then I'd have
no more use for you or
your simpleton sidekick.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.951
I'm no sidekick.

07:34.412 --> 07:36.038
Just 'cause you've got
that thing in your head

07:36.080 --> 07:39.167
doesn't mean we're expendable.

07:39.208 --> 07:41.419
Everyone's expendable.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.172
I've seen how you and your men
like to drink around here.

07:44.213 --> 07:45.840
I'm the only brewer
in this Outpost.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.843
I'd hate to see you run dry.

07:48.885 --> 07:52.305
- ( yelling )
- ( crowd murmuring )

07:52.346 --> 07:56.934
- You made me miss it.
- Mm, poor you.

08:00.354 --> 08:04.692
Maybe the next match should be
between two Outpost men.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.070
Munt, let's go.

08:08.112 --> 08:10.615
Come on. Now.

08:16.329 --> 08:19.457
- Let's go.
It's not safe here.
- I don't like Jaaris.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.835
I want to kill Jaaris.
I don't like him.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.884
He's dead. Take him.

08:44.315 --> 08:46.484
Stop.

08:46.526 --> 08:50.238
You must only pass it to Wren,
my daughter.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.120
You're not permitted
to be here.

09:02.291 --> 09:03.751
Do you wish to die today?

09:06.754 --> 09:09.173
I told you to go away.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.475
No!

09:31.153 --> 09:33.739
It's all right, my child.

09:33.781 --> 09:38.911
You will pass your next gift
to my daughter.

09:43.165 --> 09:46.002
- Talon:
Is Tobin still out?
- Yeah.

10:00.391 --> 10:01.892
Is she in here?

10:09.025 --> 10:12.445
Yes. Yes, she's here.

10:12.486 --> 10:16.616
- Captain Garret Spears.
- In the flesh.

10:17.908 --> 10:19.994
Thanks to me
bringing you back to life.

10:20.036 --> 10:23.789
Exactly.
Which is why we're here.

10:23.831 --> 10:26.834
- This woman is Two?
- Yes.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.712
A bit pathetic without
her ornamentation, isn't she?

10:33.966 --> 10:35.426
What do you want?

10:35.468 --> 10:38.012
I want you to bring
our queen back to life.

10:39.597 --> 10:43.059
- She is alive.
- We're going to kill her.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.686
The woman who put you in here
is infecting people

10:45.728 --> 10:47.605
with kinjes
she can control them with,

10:47.647 --> 10:51.192
and the only way to cure them
is to kill them.

10:52.985 --> 10:57.239
- What are you smiling about?
- I'm your only hope.

10:57.281 --> 10:59.909
What's your point?

10:59.950 --> 11:02.411
I don't wish to stay
in this cell.

11:02.453 --> 11:04.872
You want us to free you
in order to get you to help us?

11:04.914 --> 11:07.249
I've heard from the whispers
in these walls

11:07.291 --> 11:12.463
that people are heading
to Gallwood Outpost for
sanctuary from the infection.

11:12.505 --> 11:16.175
I want your word to give me
safe passage there.

11:16.217 --> 11:19.303
Only then will I help you
save the false queen.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.806
Do not call her that.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.391
What would you have me call her?

11:23.432 --> 11:27.311
Up until a few days ago,
The Three controlled the Realm,

11:27.353 --> 11:30.189
not this weak, pathetic woman.

11:30.231 --> 11:32.441
Enough.

11:36.195 --> 11:39.865
Where are the other two?

11:39.907 --> 11:43.035
One never returned from
the invasion of the Outpost,

11:43.077 --> 11:46.872
and Three left when he saw
your so-called god arriving.

11:46.914 --> 11:48.457
Yavalla is not our god.

11:50.918 --> 11:53.504
Do we have a deal?

11:53.546 --> 11:56.632
You will take me to
the sanctuary of the Outpost,

11:56.674 --> 11:58.384
and I will save your queen.

12:06.726 --> 12:11.689
- You have my word.
- Fine. Let's get this done.

12:13.149 --> 12:15.109
It's not as simple as that.

12:15.151 --> 12:16.902
Of course it is.
You brought me
back from the dead.

12:16.944 --> 12:19.405
Because you were useful
to the Prime Order.

12:19.447 --> 12:22.575
We sacrificed another life
to bring you back.

12:22.616 --> 12:25.536
What are you saying?

12:25.578 --> 12:28.748
In order for my kinj
to bring someone back
from the dead,

12:28.789 --> 12:32.543
I must absorb
the life of another.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.420
A soul for a soul.

13:03.991 --> 13:06.911
( grunting )

13:24.094 --> 13:25.429
Here, take some water.

13:28.390 --> 13:31.435
- Enough!
- Take some water.

13:31.477 --> 13:32.645
He's going to die anyway.

13:43.072 --> 13:44.824
I convinced the old ogre
to let me bring water.

13:44.865 --> 13:46.116
Thank you.

13:49.161 --> 13:51.455
I really want to kiss you.

13:51.497 --> 13:54.625
This is for you.

13:54.667 --> 13:55.876
I'll try and get some more
for your friends each run,

13:55.918 --> 13:56.877
but we're running out of food.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.546
What about the Lu-Qiri?

13:58.587 --> 14:00.965
They're bringing
less and less each day.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.925
- ( grunting )
- Can't figure out why.

14:02.967 --> 14:06.428
- ( yelling )
- ( crowd murmuring )

14:06.470 --> 14:08.931
Clean the mess up,
pointy-ears.

14:11.141 --> 14:12.226
I think he's talking to me.

14:38.294 --> 14:42.840
Tell me, sir,
why were you imprisoned?

14:42.882 --> 14:47.761
The way to solve a puzzle
is a puzzle.

14:47.803 --> 14:51.974
he lost his mind many years ago
after he murdered his wife.

15:02.234 --> 15:05.154
- Talon: And him?
- Beat a peasant girl.

15:05.195 --> 15:08.908
That's not true. She lies.

15:15.122 --> 15:19.084
- Can we believe her?
- No.

15:19.126 --> 15:20.336
Not even a little.

15:26.550 --> 15:29.470
I don't think Gwynn would
want us to kill an innocent man
just to save her.

15:29.511 --> 15:35.309
Talon, our duty is
to protect Gwynn and save her
no matter the cost.

15:35.351 --> 15:38.771
Now, this old man,
he lost himself long ago.

15:38.812 --> 15:42.232
We'd be putting him
out of his misery.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.361
- I hate this.
- I know.

15:45.402 --> 15:46.946
But I see no other way.

15:49.406 --> 15:51.158
The old man.

16:04.171 --> 16:10.094
- Can you heal my pain?
- No, but I can take it away.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.320
Your turn.

16:31.281 --> 16:33.492
Talon, you don't have
to do this.

16:33.534 --> 16:36.620
- I can do it.
- No.

16:40.040 --> 16:44.003
I want Yavalla to see my face.

16:45.754 --> 16:48.173
If this doesn't work,
I'll cut your head off myself.

16:54.555 --> 16:56.181
I'm sorry, Gwynn.

16:58.642 --> 17:01.270
- ( gasping )
- I know you're in there,
Yavalla.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.411
Go to hell.

17:18.495 --> 17:21.790
( gasping )

17:31.050 --> 17:32.551
She actually killed her.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.891
Did you say something,
High Priestess?

17:38.932 --> 17:40.809
The Queen is dead.

17:40.851 --> 17:46.356
Then you are our queen now,
High Priestess.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.743
Well, do it!

17:59.745 --> 18:01.455
Do it! Now!

18:11.131 --> 18:13.675
( gasping )

18:13.717 --> 18:18.514
Talon, what's going on?
Did you just strangle me?

18:18.555 --> 18:20.599
Can you feel Yavalla still?

18:20.641 --> 18:22.101
No. No, I can't feel her.

18:22.142 --> 18:24.353
( grunting )

18:24.394 --> 18:26.522
Tobin!

18:26.563 --> 18:28.023
What are you doing, Garret?

18:28.065 --> 18:32.236
I know. Dying's painful.

18:49.294 --> 18:50.462
I didn't say you could
kill him.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.714
You already killed
your friend.

18:52.756 --> 18:54.883
Would you have been able
to decide who should die
to save him?

18:56.552 --> 18:57.761
Fine. Hurry up.

19:12.401 --> 19:15.028
( gasping )

19:15.070 --> 19:18.532
Tobin, you're okay.

19:18.574 --> 19:19.533
It's all right.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.679
I'm the Baroness of Aegisford

19:40.721 --> 19:42.806
and I demand to be let in
to see my husband.

19:42.848 --> 19:46.435
( laughter )

19:50.105 --> 19:52.566
- Hello, Baroness.
- Do I know you?

19:52.608 --> 19:53.567
Don't believe so.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.694
But you want to.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.738
And why is that then?

19:57.779 --> 20:02.826
Because I and I alone
decide your fate today.

20:04.620 --> 20:07.497
Pardon me,
but what are they doing?

20:07.539 --> 20:09.458
What are you doing?

20:09.499 --> 20:10.918
They're all clear.

20:13.712 --> 20:16.423
Get your hands off me.
How dare you?

20:16.465 --> 20:19.593
You don't want to do this.

20:23.805 --> 20:24.848
Lower your weapons.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.810
Open the gate.

20:34.691 --> 20:37.027
Take her grains
to food storage.

20:37.069 --> 20:41.406
And let's slaughter
the horses for supper.

20:41.448 --> 20:44.159
- You can't do that.
- No worry.

20:44.201 --> 20:46.620
I'll happily share the meat

20:46.662 --> 20:50.249
with a lovely Baroness
such as yourself.

20:50.290 --> 20:53.210
Unless, of course,
you don't want in

20:53.252 --> 20:54.670
to the only
remaining safe haven.

20:56.088 --> 20:59.591
- Suit yourself.
- Stop!

21:00.884 --> 21:02.552
Wait.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.308
Let us in.

21:34.668 --> 21:37.087
Munt! Stop eating.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.464
We're trying to make sure that
people don't starve to death,

21:39.506 --> 21:41.842
and there you are
just stuffing your face.

21:41.883 --> 21:45.762
I'm sorry, Janzo.
I eat when I'm worried.

21:45.804 --> 21:48.473
I'm worried about Warlita.

21:48.515 --> 21:50.183
Yes, well,
as am I about Wren.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.855
How much did the Lu-Qiri
bring back today?

21:54.896 --> 21:57.691
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

21:57.733 --> 22:01.069
Livestock can't be
that scarce already.

22:01.111 --> 22:05.949
Not unless Yavalla's keeping
it all for her minions.

22:05.991 --> 22:08.285
That's exactly what
she's doing, Munt.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.747
She's stealing our food.
The old hag's trying
to starve us out.

22:11.788 --> 22:13.248
Monstrous!

22:15.500 --> 22:17.085
Munt!

22:19.963 --> 22:22.424
See? Wasn't so bad, was it?

22:22.466 --> 22:24.301
Yes. Not something I'm eager
to try again, Garret.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.136
You don't feel connected
to Yavalla anymore?

22:26.178 --> 22:28.513
No. That was very strange
being connected

22:28.555 --> 22:30.724
- to all those
people like that.
- Yes, I agree.

22:30.766 --> 22:33.185
I'm sure Janzo will want
to hear all about it.

22:33.226 --> 22:36.480
But first, we need
to get you out of here
and back to the Outpost.

22:36.521 --> 22:38.940
How are we going to
get them out of here
without being noticed?

22:38.982 --> 22:41.151
Well, it doesn't matter
if we're noticed.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.570
I'm their Queen,
and they still think Tobin and I
are connected to the United.

22:43.612 --> 22:46.656
Yavalla will see through
one of her infected
that you survived.

22:46.698 --> 22:49.326
No. Yavalla only sees
what she triggers

22:49.368 --> 22:50.952
or what alerts her,
like a commotion.

22:50.994 --> 22:53.080
But if the United still think
we're one of them,

22:53.121 --> 22:55.749
no alarm bells
should go off for her.

22:55.791 --> 22:58.460
You're free.
Get out of here.

23:01.797 --> 23:05.967
She's a problem.
Everyone knows she's
part of The Three.

23:06.009 --> 23:09.137
For everything she
and the other two have done
to plunder this realm,

23:09.179 --> 23:11.306
best thing we could do
is kill her.

23:11.348 --> 23:14.851
- That wasn't our deal.
- What deal?

23:14.893 --> 23:19.523
We promised her
safe passage to the Outpost
if she saved you and Tobin.

23:19.564 --> 23:23.193
All right, fine.
How do you suppose
we disguise her?

23:31.034 --> 23:33.495
( indistinct chatter )

23:45.841 --> 23:47.342
Make way for your Queen.

24:28.925 --> 24:30.927
More refugees.

24:30.969 --> 24:33.930
- Let's go.
- No, we have to help them.

24:33.972 --> 24:36.266
We can't.
We need to get you back
to the Outpost.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.935
- They'll just slow us down.
- She's right, Gwynn.

24:38.977 --> 24:42.647
We need to make sure
you don't become one of
Yavalla's infected again.

24:42.689 --> 24:44.608
This is all my fault.

24:44.649 --> 24:46.109
If I hadn't have trusted
Yavalla so quickly--

24:46.151 --> 24:48.278
You were the first person
to be infected, Gwynn.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.238
You had no way of knowing
what she was up to.

24:50.280 --> 24:54.284
- I should have.
- If anyone should have,
it was Zed.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.869
He's the one who insisted
on bringing her through.

24:55.911 --> 24:57.829
And he also just saved us.

25:01.124 --> 25:04.544
- Hope he's all right.
- I'm sure he's fine.

25:04.586 --> 25:08.548
You humans
have gotten no smarter.

25:08.590 --> 25:12.594
And you,
if Dred had killed you
when he was ordered to,

25:12.636 --> 25:14.930
Blackbloods would
all be extinct

25:14.971 --> 25:17.641
- and the Realm would be safe.
- Whoa! Hey.

25:17.682 --> 25:20.435
( groaning )

25:20.477 --> 25:22.687
I just saved your friends.

25:22.729 --> 25:24.898
And that is the only reason
you're still alive.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.942
You wouldn't have needed me

25:26.983 --> 25:29.569
if you hadn't brought
the white kinj from
the Plane of Ashes.

25:32.197 --> 25:34.699
We didn't bring it
from the Plane of Ashes.

25:34.741 --> 25:36.785
It was already here.

25:57.639 --> 25:59.641
Hey, you.

25:59.683 --> 26:01.643
My name's Janzo,
not "Hey, you."

26:01.685 --> 26:03.061
I'm looking for my husband.

26:03.103 --> 26:05.146
Oh, are you?
And who is your husband?

26:05.188 --> 26:07.357
- Baroness Falista.
- Hey, Munt.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.150
What are you doing here?
Where's Gertie?

26:09.192 --> 26:11.611
Gertrusha's still in Aegisford.
I'm afraid she's been infected.

26:11.653 --> 26:13.947
Um, sorry to break up
your little reunion here.

26:13.989 --> 26:15.949
How exactly do you two
know each other?

26:15.991 --> 26:18.952
Oh, Janzo,
this is Tobin's wife.

26:18.994 --> 26:20.537
- What?
- Yeah.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.664
You're the one Tobin married
to get an army?

26:22.706 --> 26:25.417
How unfortunate.
What exactly are you doing here?

26:25.458 --> 26:28.169
I've already told you.
I'm here to find my husband.

26:28.211 --> 26:31.881
- Where is he?
- Um, Tobin's already
been infected.

26:31.923 --> 26:34.134
He left and, um,
who did he leave with, Munt?

26:34.175 --> 26:36.720
- It was, uh--
- Ah, yes. Queen Rosmund.

26:36.761 --> 26:39.639
Why didn't you tell me that
in the first place?

26:39.681 --> 26:41.975
I still have a few men left.
I'll go after him.

26:42.017 --> 26:44.185
Janzo, why don't you tell her?

26:44.227 --> 26:45.770
Because we already have
more qualified men

26:45.812 --> 26:47.772
who have left to find them.

26:47.814 --> 26:50.191
Plus, the, um, test rats,
well, you see, the thing is

26:50.233 --> 26:52.527
- is that they're dying
at a faster rate.
- Ooh, yes.

26:52.569 --> 26:56.656
One would only hope
that the difference is in
metabolic rates in humans

26:56.698 --> 26:58.533
causes them to, um,
live a little longer.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.535
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

27:02.537 --> 27:05.332
What I'm trying to tell you
is that your Tobin,

27:05.373 --> 27:09.044
- he might already be dead.
- Yeah. Yeah, dead. Dead?

27:24.434 --> 27:26.436
Hey.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.188
You have to tell her.

27:31.900 --> 27:34.819
I know.

27:34.861 --> 27:37.238
But now's not the right time.

27:37.280 --> 27:39.407
Look, if--
if you won't, I will.

27:40.867 --> 27:42.827
You did just murder us,
Garret.

27:42.869 --> 27:45.038
Just give me a moment
to breathe, okay?

27:45.080 --> 27:47.707
And think about how I'm going
to tell the love of my life
that I'm married.

27:47.749 --> 27:49.834
It won't get any easier.

27:51.878 --> 27:53.630
What if Falista's dead?

27:53.672 --> 27:55.924
That's-- that's what
you're counting on?

27:55.965 --> 27:58.176
- That your wife might be dead?
- Yeah, I'm not proud of it.

27:58.218 --> 28:01.680
- Wow. True love.
- You know I had to do it
to get the army.

28:01.721 --> 28:04.849
Then Gwynn will understand.

28:04.891 --> 28:08.436
No. She's a proud woman.

28:08.478 --> 28:10.605
She will never have me again.

28:27.539 --> 28:31.000
Why do you think she assumed
Yavalla brought the white kinj
through the Plane of Ashes?

28:32.919 --> 28:35.880
Don't know.
Could be just an assumption

28:35.922 --> 28:39.300
since that's where Yavalla
came from.

28:39.342 --> 28:41.720
I'm not so sure.

28:46.683 --> 28:49.310
- ( squeaking )
- Go on.

28:49.352 --> 28:51.271
Next.

28:53.732 --> 28:54.649
( grunts )

29:04.325 --> 29:06.244
( squeaking stops )

29:07.996 --> 29:10.623
Gents? Gents!

29:11.750 --> 29:13.126
Oh.

29:13.168 --> 29:14.335
Okay.

29:14.377 --> 29:15.420
Hey.

29:16.588 --> 29:17.964
Please, my friends.

29:18.006 --> 29:20.008
Join and be United with us.

29:20.049 --> 29:20.967
( grunting )

29:27.474 --> 29:29.142
You let another infected in.

29:29.184 --> 29:31.394
It was one of your men.

29:31.436 --> 29:35.940
I mean, we screen all the men
just like we do everyone else.

29:35.982 --> 29:37.567
I have no idea how
they got in.

29:37.609 --> 29:40.570
From now on,
the gates remain sealed.

29:42.781 --> 29:47.327
Lock down the Outpost!
Now! Forever!

30:04.844 --> 30:06.596
There better not be
any more infected

30:06.638 --> 30:10.183
wandering around the Outpost,

30:10.225 --> 30:13.603
or you'll be next
in the ring, brewer.

30:13.645 --> 30:16.773
I'll increase the checks.

30:16.815 --> 30:19.984
You know, I, um--
I was thinking now that
we're locked down,

30:20.026 --> 30:22.195
there'll be less
mouths to feed.

30:22.237 --> 30:25.782
Perhaps-- perhaps, um,
you can give me
a barrel of grain.

30:25.824 --> 30:30.161
I can portion it out
and make sure it lasts
a few days.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.623
Nice try, brewer.

30:38.253 --> 30:41.923
Please, Janzo,
my daughter Ida,
she's starving.

30:41.965 --> 30:46.219
I have given her my portions,
but it isn't enough.

30:46.261 --> 30:49.639
I'm sorry.
I'm doing the best I can.
There's no more food.

30:49.681 --> 30:53.309
She's dying.
Help her, I beg of you.

30:55.687 --> 30:58.273
I'll think of something,
I promise.

30:59.607 --> 31:01.484
Hang in there, Alina.

31:11.494 --> 31:14.205
( muttering )

31:16.624 --> 31:18.626
Oh, Warlita.

31:25.174 --> 31:29.262
Aah! What is it, Janzo?
Aah, what happened?

31:29.304 --> 31:31.681
- We've got no more food, Munt.
- Yep.

31:31.723 --> 31:35.476
People are starving.
Children are-- are starving.

31:35.518 --> 31:39.022
The Lu-Qiri haven't brought
any food in days.

31:39.063 --> 31:42.150
Munt, we've got
nothing left to feed people
to keep them alive.

31:42.191 --> 31:44.152
- Yeah.
- ( rats squeaking )

31:44.193 --> 31:46.112
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

31:46.154 --> 31:49.866
Stupid rats.
I haven't been able
to sleep in days.

31:49.908 --> 31:50.909
( grunts )

31:59.959 --> 32:03.630
Meat is meat.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.766
- Munt?
- Yeah?

32:14.807 --> 32:16.309
Fire up the smoker.

32:16.351 --> 32:18.853
Yep. ( groans )

32:21.940 --> 32:23.107
Wh-- what--

32:30.573 --> 32:31.491
Alina.

32:33.368 --> 32:34.452
I know it's not a lot.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.873
Thank you.

32:38.915 --> 32:41.417
You've given us the gift
of more time.

32:41.459 --> 32:42.627
Every day is precious.

32:48.508 --> 32:51.594
- ( laughter )
- ( grunting )

32:54.806 --> 32:57.266
Will no one accept
my challenge?

32:59.894 --> 33:01.354
Fight me.

33:01.396 --> 33:03.189
Are those Blackbloods?

33:06.192 --> 33:07.860
Jaaris: Come on!

33:10.613 --> 33:12.031
I won't use my power.

33:14.200 --> 33:17.203
Now's your chance to kill me.

33:17.245 --> 33:19.998
I know you pointy-ears
all want me dead.

33:22.375 --> 33:24.002
Weaklings.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.715
Coward.

33:33.094 --> 33:34.971
- ( laughter )
- ( grunts )

33:47.066 --> 33:49.193
I've missed my daughter.

33:49.235 --> 33:50.987
- Mother.
- Time to join me.

33:51.029 --> 33:54.198
( grunting )
Mother, let go!

33:58.036 --> 33:59.370
Help me!

34:09.839 --> 34:11.799
( slicing )

34:30.568 --> 34:32.070
What do you say?

34:34.280 --> 34:35.615
Thank you.

34:42.538 --> 34:44.165
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.460
Where do you think
you're going?

34:50.088 --> 34:51.756
Now's your chance to repay me.

34:54.217 --> 34:56.928
It looks like
we have a volunteer.

35:12.151 --> 35:14.779
What are the Covenant guards
doing at the Outpost?

35:14.821 --> 35:19.200
It looks like they're not
letting in any more refugees.

35:19.242 --> 35:21.994
We passed a group
of Covenant soldiers on
the way to the Capital.

35:22.036 --> 35:23.704
They said they were
headed this way.

35:23.746 --> 35:26.791
- Janzo must have let them in.
- Why would he do that?

35:26.833 --> 35:28.751
The only enemy
we should have right now
is Yavalla and the United.

35:28.793 --> 35:32.296
Well, clearly not.
We'll have to sneak in
the back route.

35:32.338 --> 35:35.091
We don't know what
we're walking into.
Garret and I will go.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.009
You stay here under
Tobin's protection until
we figure it out.

35:37.051 --> 35:40.930
No. No, I'm not staying here
whilst you risk your lives
for me again.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.849
Gwynn, if the Covenant
has taken over the Outpost,

35:42.890 --> 35:44.725
you are the first one
they will try to kill.

35:44.767 --> 35:47.270
This is not up for debate.
We all go.

35:54.443 --> 35:57.738
I'm a scientist.
I'm not a fighter.

35:57.780 --> 36:00.783
Don't suppose you'd go
for a battle of wits instead?

36:03.870 --> 36:08.082
Come on, pointy-ears.
Put up your hands at least.

36:08.124 --> 36:09.959
Let her go.
Please, let her go.

36:10.001 --> 36:10.918
( grunts )

36:33.941 --> 36:35.318
Fight with this.

36:37.278 --> 36:38.571
Hmm?

36:38.613 --> 36:40.031
Huh?

36:40.072 --> 36:42.992
Look. I'll even put
my arm behind my back.

36:45.953 --> 36:49.332
Do it. Come on.

36:52.293 --> 36:53.961
( grunting )

36:54.003 --> 36:55.338
I demand you stop this
at once!

36:55.379 --> 36:58.090
- ( laughter )
- Baroness?

36:58.132 --> 37:00.051
So glad you could join us.

37:00.092 --> 37:01.552
Have you no honor, Commander?

37:01.594 --> 37:04.138
Beating a woman?

37:04.180 --> 37:05.640
She's a pointy-ear.

37:05.681 --> 37:07.391
I don't care
if she's a Greyskin.

37:07.433 --> 37:09.393
I demand you stop this!

37:09.435 --> 37:11.187
You still don't understand,
do you?

37:11.229 --> 37:14.148
You answer to me,
not the other way around.

37:18.069 --> 37:20.071
Nobility's dead.

37:20.112 --> 37:23.449
All that matters is strength.

37:23.491 --> 37:27.620
( screaming )

37:27.662 --> 37:29.747
No.

37:29.789 --> 37:33.167
She'll stay and watch this
till the end.

37:33.209 --> 37:34.669
Might teach her to control
that mouth of hers.

37:36.504 --> 37:39.215
Let me take her place.
I'll fight you.

37:39.257 --> 37:44.262
- Get off!
- Your knight in shining armor.

37:44.303 --> 37:47.390
Think of this as punishment
for letting another infected in.

37:47.431 --> 37:50.601
You lose your girl,
I keep my brewer.

37:50.643 --> 37:54.146
- He'll watch, too.
- ( grunting )

37:56.440 --> 37:59.235
- Janzo: Wren!
- ( shouting )

37:59.277 --> 38:01.904
- Wren!
- It's over.

38:04.490 --> 38:07.243
( laughter )

38:14.875 --> 38:18.587
Who's ready to see me slaughter
this pointy-eared scum?

38:20.381 --> 38:22.174
Wren.

38:22.216 --> 38:24.468
You ready?

38:24.510 --> 38:26.554
I'm ready to see you try.

38:26.595 --> 38:28.848
( music playing )

38:28.889 --> 38:29.807
Talon!

38:31.309 --> 38:33.519
I remember you from the road.

38:33.561 --> 38:36.897
We didn't have a chance
to exchange names.

38:36.939 --> 38:39.900
Just call me
pointy-eared scum.

38:39.942 --> 38:42.320
You like the little sport
we're having here,
pointy-eared scum?

38:46.532 --> 38:48.784
Hunting down and killing
innocent peasants wasn't enough

38:48.826 --> 38:50.077
for you and your
Prime Order hounds?

38:50.119 --> 38:51.245
I like a challenge.

38:51.287 --> 38:52.496
Now you've got one.

38:52.538 --> 38:55.666
- Get her out of here.
- Wren.

39:08.971 --> 39:10.931
( grunting )

39:40.711 --> 39:43.672
Man: Get him now!
Come on!

40:42.106 --> 40:44.233
Red?

40:44.275 --> 40:45.609
You must be the new One.

40:49.321 --> 40:51.490
Your kinj doesn't work on me.

40:54.910 --> 40:56.245
Is that what these things
are called?

40:56.287 --> 40:57.663
Yes.

40:58.956 --> 41:00.207
But yours will die
with you.

41:16.223 --> 41:18.058
No.

41:23.105 --> 41:25.441
This will always be
our Outpost!

41:25.483 --> 41:28.444
( cheering )

41:36.619 --> 41:37.536
( cheers )

41:39.955 --> 41:43.626
( music playing )
