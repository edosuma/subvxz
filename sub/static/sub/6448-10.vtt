37:16.817 --> 37:17.977
Nice.

37:19.237 --> 37:20.727
Someone taught you well.

37:22.907 --> 37:26.525
Yeah, then told me
he didn't wanna see me again.

37:26.702 --> 37:28.317
Nice.

37:28.496 --> 37:30.987
Mia, l was trying to protect you.

37:31.499 --> 37:34.787
I felt like if I split from you,
Vortigen would leave you alone.

37:34.961 --> 37:37.498
Yeah, well, next time
you're being an unselﬁsh hero...

37:37.672 --> 37:42.507
...I could use some explain-o,
Green Arrow...

37:43.386 --> 37:47.470
...or Mr. Green Arrow.

37:49.892 --> 37:51.507
Don't worry.

37:51.686 --> 37:55.520
I'm not gonna go tell all my friends
I used to train with the Emerald Archer.

37:56.524 --> 37:58.765
Well, he's not done with you yet.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.275
Heh.

38:03.155 --> 38:06.283
I mean, unless, of course,
you're done with him.

38:06.701 --> 38:08.282
No.

38:08.661 --> 38:11.243
No, I'm actually glad
my old teacher showed up again.

38:12.999 --> 38:16.287
Yours, not so much.

38:21.757 --> 38:24.214
I still can't get him out of my head.

38:25.720 --> 38:29.554
I keep thinking, by the time Vortigen
gets out of prison, he'll be an old man.

38:30.099 --> 38:32.715
I think you got better things
to worry about.

38:32.893 --> 38:34.929
I'm not worried about him.

38:35.104 --> 38:37.436
Mia, it's what he said.

38:40.901 --> 38:42.732
I think he's right.

38:43.446 --> 38:46.313
What if I can't outrun
these dark places inside me?

38:47.074 --> 38:49.235
That's why you need me...

38:49.410 --> 38:50.695
...to keep you in check.

38:53.581 --> 38:55.867
There's a dark place inside everyone,
Oliver.

38:56.292 --> 38:59.455
What we do with it
depends not on who our teachers are...

38:59.628 --> 39:03.212
...but what we do
with the lessons Ieamed.

39:13.434 --> 39:15.925
Lois Lane is off limits.

39:21.442 --> 39:24.400
A Rao charm for good luck
is hardly cause for alarm.

39:24.570 --> 39:27.107
Why would you give her
some Kryptonian symbol?

39:27.281 --> 39:29.772
Rao symbolizes all that is good.

39:30.284 --> 39:32.149
Once again,
you assume the worst of me.

39:32.328 --> 39:34.410
We both know
the only reason you visited Lois...

39:34.580 --> 39:37.037
...was to send me a message.

39:37.625 --> 39:40.207
You can't hurt me,
but you will hurt those I care about.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.915
Living on Earth
has made you mistrustful.

39:45.007 --> 39:47.293
I trust those who trust me.

39:47.468 --> 39:50.175
You trust no one, Kal-El...

39:51.806 --> 39:54.639
...not even the woman
that you're supposed to care for.

39:56.477 --> 39:59.139
She has no idea who you are, does she?

40:00.481 --> 40:03.973
Crossing that line
is why I won't help you get your powers.

40:05.653 --> 40:08.816
I'm just trying to save our race.

40:08.989 --> 40:11.025
You're just doing this
to save your army.

40:11.200 --> 40:14.158
Without them you're just an ofﬁcer
with no one to command.

40:14.328 --> 40:15.363
Uh-uh.

40:15.538 --> 40:19.156
I do not do this out of ego,
I do this out of desperation.

40:19.333 --> 40:22.541
Don't act like there isn't some agenda
you're not telling me about.

40:24.755 --> 40:27.838
You go near Lois again,
I will destroy you all.

40:42.189 --> 40:44.350
You won't have to.

40:48.070 --> 40:51.312
-Did you ﬁnd what you were after?
-He didn't recognize the symbol.

40:51.490 --> 40:53.355
-We don't have much time.
-I know.

40:53.534 --> 40:56.617
I guess the Book of Rao
is not on Earth after all.

40:58.038 --> 41:00.871
No, Jor-El, he left it here.

41:01.041 --> 41:02.702
And when we ﬁnd it...

41:02.877 --> 41:06.085
...we will have the means
to complete the tower.

41:09.884 --> 41:13.877
And we will turn the yellow sun red.

41:16.557 --> 41:23.019
And then Kal-El will not be the only one
with powers on this Earth.

41:23.647 --> 41:27.890
He will be
just one of many soldiers in my army.

41:28.569 --> 41:31.652
Or a prisoner in my stockade.

42:18.786 --> 42:20.777
