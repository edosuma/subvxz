00:01.140 --> 00:03.360
Previously on Spotless...

00:03.844 --> 00:05.190
I need your help.

00:06.276 --> 00:07.630
It's not complicated.

00:07.750 --> 00:08.835
Won't take long.

00:09.232 --> 00:11.086
I'm taking over the Met investigation

00:11.113 --> 00:14.285
into the activities of DCI Tom Kendrick.

00:16.544 --> 00:18.992
It's early days, but anything you know,

00:19.040 --> 00:21.849
photographs, logbooks, diaries...

00:21.850 --> 00:23.386
anything you think could help.

00:23.418 --> 00:25.585
I know where your wife works.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.550
I know where your kids go to school.

00:28.616 --> 00:30.350
I am gonna make them bleed.

00:30.373 --> 00:33.323
- Do you lie to me much?
- What? No.

00:33.890 --> 00:35.236
What kind of question is that?

00:36.035 --> 00:37.883
You didn't know

00:38.055 --> 00:40.244
that your husband had
been in care, did you?

00:40.364 --> 00:43.497
We were put in care, after my
father died, for a couple of years.

00:43.708 --> 00:46.107
- Where was your mother?
- She was

00:46.323 --> 00:48.333
getting lost in drink around that time.

00:49.530 --> 00:51.159
I'm offering you our services,

00:51.218 --> 00:52.791
in exchange for your protection

00:52.813 --> 00:56.444
against Nelson Clay and a little problem
that has been following me from France.

00:56.947 --> 00:58.357
We need payment,

00:58.368 --> 00:59.714
or our product back.

01:02.853 --> 01:04.036
Show me.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:20.653 --> 03:23.350
I'm worried about you.

03:49.482 --> 03:50.461
You look nice.

03:52.722 --> 03:54.424
Who are you getting all dressed up for?

03:54.585 --> 03:55.922
Uh, Michael Hillier.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.727
Works in travel I think.

03:57.920 --> 03:59.765
He saw my website and wants to meet up,

03:59.772 --> 04:01.978
he's interested in commissioning 3 pieces.

04:02.403 --> 04:03.240
That's great.

04:03.858 --> 04:05.883
I could retire early and be a kept man.

04:10.117 --> 04:12.600
How many commissions is that now?

04:12.720 --> 04:15.028
Including this one, a mighty 4.

04:17.065 --> 04:18.471
You know, it's early days yet.

04:19.416 --> 04:21.916
Maddy, Oliver, can you get a move please!

04:25.054 --> 04:26.627
Go, I'll take the kids to school.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.228
Julie, go. I can do it, please.

04:31.805 --> 04:32.406
OK.

05:03.254 --> 05:04.033
Oliver?

05:04.237 --> 05:05.055
Maddy?

05:05.700 --> 05:06.686
Ready to go!

05:15.080 --> 05:15.939
What is this?

05:16.977 --> 05:17.881
For lessons?

05:18.715 --> 05:20.406
No, girls in my class are reading it.

05:21.106 --> 05:22.057
Is it any good?

05:22.533 --> 05:23.441
Heart-breaking.

05:27.546 --> 05:29.134
So, how do you like your new school?

05:29.571 --> 05:30.373
It's OK.

05:30.696 --> 05:31.454
OK?

05:32.221 --> 05:33.527
It needs to be amazing.

05:34.720 --> 05:35.790
It needs to be fun!

05:36.441 --> 05:37.644
It's not the school.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.294
All the other girls are so...

05:41.885 --> 05:42.695
So what?

05:44.716 --> 05:47.819
You know, it takes time to
find your place. Until then,

05:48.417 --> 05:51.091
just fake it. Like those girls.

05:52.766 --> 05:54.299
Nobody even knows who I am.

05:58.203 --> 05:59.025
Wait for me here.

06:03.338 --> 06:03.995
Excuse me?

06:04.624 --> 06:05.300
Hey.

06:05.741 --> 06:07.617
I'm so sorry. It's entirely my fault.

06:07.621 --> 06:09.811
Our accountant's insisting on it, I just

06:09.818 --> 06:11.694
can't seem to put my
hands on the paperwork.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.871
Right, so there are three...

06:15.922 --> 06:18.914
three loans, all secured against the house?

06:20.348 --> 06:23.400
No, I knew that. That's
exactly what I've got

06:23.640 --> 06:24.902
written down in front of me.

06:25.791 --> 06:27.124
Thank you. Thanks so much.

06:31.480 --> 06:32.227
Hi.

06:33.919 --> 06:35.770
The, uh, main door was open.

06:36.040 --> 06:37.514
- Mr Hillier?
- Yes.

06:37.788 --> 06:41.167
- I'm sorry, I'm a little early.
- No, no, that's absolutely fine.

06:41.499 --> 06:42.396
Please,

06:42.838 --> 06:44.429
- call me Michael.
- I'm Julie.

06:46.000 --> 06:46.936
Please.

07:31.197 --> 07:32.444
Thank you.

07:35.750 --> 07:37.661
The spectrum of death.

07:39.639 --> 07:40.825
First love.

07:42.225 --> 07:44.880
A combination that is
too much for a young mind.

07:44.904 --> 07:46.077
Best to start early.

07:46.102 --> 07:48.277
Avoid perpetual disappointment.

07:48.731 --> 07:50.900
You're obviously choosing the wrong men.

07:51.637 --> 07:52.946
I agree with that.

07:53.787 --> 07:55.102
I can help you.

07:55.145 --> 07:57.087
That's very kind of you.

07:57.207 --> 07:59.133
I mean I'd fuck you.

07:59.403 --> 08:01.977
I would never fix you
up with some other guys.

08:02.014 --> 08:04.360
Uh, again, thanks for the clarification.

08:04.386 --> 08:07.237
Can we stop with the sex
talk? I'm having my hobnobs.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.782
Would you stop doing
that? I'm trying to study!

08:11.800 --> 08:13.262
Education's overrated.

08:13.382 --> 08:15.750
- Live a little.
- That's 'cause you're barely literate.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.139
Will you stop irritating the girl?

08:17.160 --> 08:20.093
As it happens I have a first in
political philosophy from UCD,

08:20.120 --> 08:21.760
so literacy isn't an issue.

08:21.880 --> 08:23.769
So you can put that in your pipe.

08:24.492 --> 08:26.269
Good for you, man.

08:33.937 --> 08:36.429
I don't like you just hanging around here.

08:37.989 --> 08:39.019
Where do you want me?

08:39.856 --> 08:40.847
Do you really wanna know?

08:43.410 --> 08:45.346
- What's that for?
- Storage.

08:45.466 --> 08:46.348
For what?

08:51.495 --> 08:52.600
Sometimes,

08:52.851 --> 08:53.956
when we work,

08:54.361 --> 08:55.541
I keep things.

08:55.720 --> 08:57.514
What, like souvenirs?

08:58.093 --> 08:59.229
Like a serial killer?

08:59.241 --> 09:01.907
From jobs that a certain
client makes us do.

09:03.421 --> 09:04.526
Insurance.

09:05.776 --> 09:08.533
Bullet casings, blood
samples, fingerprints.

09:09.008 --> 09:11.565
- Anything that ties them with Nelson.
- You're serious?

09:12.682 --> 09:13.386
Yeah.

09:14.172 --> 09:15.643
I'm gonna use this

09:16.390 --> 09:17.381
to find a way out.

09:18.195 --> 09:20.688
This little CSI party you've got going on,

09:21.164 --> 09:22.453
isn't worth shit.

09:23.400 --> 09:26.855
In two minutes in court, some
smart-ass lawyer would rip it to shreds.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.760
Fabricated, circumstantial,

09:29.768 --> 09:30.822
inadmissible,

09:31.187 --> 09:32.390
take your pick.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.392
Well, at least it's something.

09:34.974 --> 09:36.280
And when the time comes...

09:36.343 --> 09:37.598
And when do you think that will be?

09:37.640 --> 09:40.409
When you've collected
enough fingernail clippings?

09:45.760 --> 09:46.550
Oh, I got it.

09:46.905 --> 09:47.743
I got it.

09:55.516 --> 09:56.405
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:56.413 --> 09:57.942
- Hello my friend.
- How you doing?

09:58.062 --> 09:59.921
- What are you doing here?
- Don't worry,

09:59.960 --> 10:01.120
everything's going well.

10:01.171 --> 10:03.565
D... don't be nervous, it's early days.

10:03.685 --> 10:04.415
Well...

10:04.784 --> 10:05.869
Did you find them?

10:06.600 --> 10:07.648
You didn't find them?

10:07.903 --> 10:09.280
Still alive, aren't you?

10:09.320 --> 10:11.535
So, now...

10:12.980 --> 10:15.354
I'd like you to return the favor.

10:15.665 --> 10:16.982
I'd like to know

10:17.400 --> 10:20.757
how Nelson Clay gets his
cocaine into the country.

10:24.688 --> 10:28.168
Yeah, no, I don't have access
to that kind of information.

10:28.188 --> 10:29.648
So get access.

10:31.899 --> 10:34.086
But, we don't do that
kind of service for him.

10:34.206 --> 10:35.723
I know, my friend.

10:36.745 --> 10:38.672
But you'll get the information

10:38.697 --> 10:40.068
all the same.

12:07.601 --> 12:09.709
I need a counter-sign on a contract

12:09.739 --> 12:11.128
for the Stoke Newington's job,

12:11.129 --> 12:13.931
and Padraig needs an extra
pair of hands for tonight.

12:15.017 --> 12:18.050
Call Clyde, he's always
fishing for more shifts.

12:20.699 --> 12:22.223
Anything I can help with?

12:22.440 --> 12:23.300
What?

12:26.332 --> 12:29.164
There's certain things
you're best kept away from.

12:58.922 --> 13:00.680
Didn't think I'd hear from you again.

13:00.716 --> 13:01.581
Why?

13:02.608 --> 13:04.234
Going to your apartment,

13:04.529 --> 13:05.680
things I said.

13:05.709 --> 13:08.571
I'm a tough girl, I don't scare so easily.

13:10.292 --> 13:12.042
- Thank you.
- For what?

13:14.327 --> 13:16.847
For just... being nice to me.

13:18.450 --> 13:20.494
Nice is thin on the ground right now.

13:21.753 --> 13:23.087
I wanna see you.

13:23.550 --> 13:24.473
Now.

13:25.007 --> 13:26.080
Gimme

13:26.350 --> 13:27.622
20 minutes.

13:33.091 --> 13:34.670
What about something like this?

13:35.006 --> 13:38.071
That's Pennsylvanian cherry
wood. It's very practical.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.797
The color can be a bit flat, but

13:40.000 --> 13:42.995
I mean, given what you're looking for,
it's got a really nice simplicity of form.

13:43.042 --> 13:44.295
Yeah, it's beautiful.

13:45.387 --> 13:48.835
You know, I really like the
red of the Madagascar rosewood.

13:48.849 --> 13:50.296
We used to have a piece in that, but

13:50.542 --> 13:52.661
don't think I could now, in all conscience.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.636
There's a moratorium on
trading it at all, isn't there?

13:55.939 --> 13:57.524
Yeah, that's right. Um,

13:57.898 --> 14:00.613
yeah, I mean, there are still
a few rogue traders out there,

14:00.623 --> 14:02.605
but I know personally I
wouldn't go down that road.

14:06.198 --> 14:09.211
My husband says that... that
rosewood is coffin material.

14:09.240 --> 14:10.328
He would not have it in the house.

14:10.375 --> 14:11.629
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:11.671 --> 14:13.242
Oh. Well, I'm a fan.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.902
- Is your husband in the same line as you?
- No. God, no.

14:18.770 --> 14:20.487
Uh, he's in forensics.

14:20.714 --> 14:21.807
What, the police?

14:21.968 --> 14:24.432
N... not exactly. Um,

14:24.640 --> 14:26.063
he works for the authorities,

14:26.091 --> 14:29.089
uh, cleaning up criminal
activity, that kind of thing.

14:29.090 --> 14:30.760
I think it can be pretty gruesome.

14:30.880 --> 14:32.222
Yeah, not for me.

14:32.785 --> 14:34.119
I'm very squeamish.

14:34.285 --> 14:36.919
I'll duck and cover if
somebody gets a splinter.

14:40.477 --> 14:42.539
So what about you, do you have a family?

14:43.234 --> 14:44.203
I did.

14:45.561 --> 14:46.980
My wife passed away.

14:48.025 --> 14:49.150
I'm so sorry.

14:50.853 --> 14:52.110
We were very young

14:52.230 --> 14:53.454
when we got together.

14:54.570 --> 14:56.401
Yeah, I think it's fair to say

14:56.784 --> 14:59.603
you are not your best self, at 19.

15:00.398 --> 15:01.188
Well...

15:01.471 --> 15:02.427
she was.

15:03.486 --> 15:04.446
I wasn't.

15:05.411 --> 15:07.502
I didn't behave particularly well.

15:10.065 --> 15:11.740
If I knew then what I do now...

15:17.899 --> 15:18.724
Sorry.

15:18.844 --> 15:20.569
God no, please, no, please...

15:20.635 --> 15:22.053
No, don't apologize.

15:23.722 --> 15:24.484
Right,

15:24.858 --> 15:26.314
what happens now?

15:26.986 --> 15:28.485
Do I leave you a deposit?

15:30.117 --> 15:31.266
Uh, yes.

15:32.591 --> 15:33.631
Right.

15:46.386 --> 15:48.042
I haven't heard from Victor in

15:48.162 --> 15:49.350
over a week now.

15:49.390 --> 15:52.251
I can't help feeling it's
just the calm before the storm.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.226
Is it exciting?

15:58.689 --> 16:00.198
What? No.

16:01.160 --> 16:01.869
There's no

16:01.907 --> 16:04.220
- part of you that gets a buzz out of it?
- No.

16:05.625 --> 16:07.640
'Cause at the moment, you're winning.

16:08.070 --> 16:10.151
Even if it doesn't feel like it.

16:12.701 --> 16:14.020
You're alive, aren't you?

16:14.512 --> 16:15.799
You've got more money.

16:16.358 --> 16:18.259
You're here, with me.

16:21.381 --> 16:22.568
Do you like surprises?

16:23.722 --> 16:25.391
I want to take you to dinner.

16:26.300 --> 16:28.520
Well, there's no surprises if you tell me.

16:28.541 --> 16:29.232
Tonight.

16:30.040 --> 16:32.440
This pop up restaurant in Hoxton, you...

16:32.490 --> 16:35.228
- only pay what you think dinner's worth.
- Seriously?

16:35.555 --> 16:37.635
Well, in France, it would
close after one night.

16:37.848 --> 16:39.205
You never know what you're gonna get,

16:39.210 --> 16:42.284
it's a set menu, and apparently
the food is out of this world.

16:43.917 --> 16:44.697
Sorry.

16:46.480 --> 16:47.645
Jean Bastière.

16:49.385 --> 16:50.236
Yeah.

16:52.894 --> 16:55.046
Inspector Squire, yeah, of course.

16:57.572 --> 16:59.199
I could be there in

16:59.400 --> 17:01.000
half... half an hour.

17:02.787 --> 17:03.582
OK.

17:05.842 --> 17:06.826
Have to go.

17:08.604 --> 17:09.806
But tonight,

17:09.925 --> 17:10.894
sounds good.

17:11.148 --> 17:13.097
Um... Hackney?

17:13.098 --> 17:14.507
- Hoxton.
- Hoxton.

17:40.464 --> 17:41.287
Thanks.

17:44.467 --> 17:45.262
Oh!

17:46.364 --> 17:47.509
Tits at lunch.

17:47.963 --> 17:49.164
I love this country.

17:55.106 --> 17:56.331
Could you leave us, Guillaume?

17:56.451 --> 17:57.206
Sure.

18:01.018 --> 18:02.778
- You too, Nico.
- What?

18:02.943 --> 18:03.922
But finally,

18:04.249 --> 18:05.592
this is the good part.

18:10.520 --> 18:12.852
Or of course it mean we do it old school.

18:14.545 --> 18:15.481
Go on.

18:19.856 --> 18:20.683
OK.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.900
- But don't let him, try and get...
- Get the fuck out of here!

18:24.869 --> 18:26.936
You're both pricks, you know that?

18:35.600 --> 18:38.571
One more minute with Nico,
and I turn the gun on myself.

18:40.014 --> 18:42.378
You're still mad about that poker game?

18:42.899 --> 18:44.502
I only took what was mine.

18:44.980 --> 18:46.361
15 grand.

18:49.400 --> 18:52.246
How is that the same as
stealing a 100 grand of heroin?

19:21.442 --> 19:22.507
What is this?

19:23.334 --> 19:24.933
Dutch courage?

19:26.002 --> 19:27.445
I hate the Dutch.

19:27.908 --> 19:29.337
You hate everyone.

19:46.290 --> 19:49.458
You never understood in all the
years I've had to work with you.

19:50.347 --> 19:52.338
Action leads to consequence.

19:52.561 --> 19:54.306
You steal, we come after you.

19:54.426 --> 19:56.270
One follows the other!

19:56.775 --> 19:58.109
See the connection?

19:58.770 --> 20:00.024
Don't you get it?

20:00.144 --> 20:01.873
A man like you is just a part

20:01.911 --> 20:03.888
of someone else's bigger picture.

20:04.008 --> 20:06.011
You fucking retard.

20:19.770 --> 20:22.017
600 euros that cost me.

20:25.782 --> 20:27.248
You got robbed.

20:28.913 --> 20:30.450
Fucking dentists.

20:32.271 --> 20:33.945
Why do you wanna draw this out?

20:38.480 --> 20:39.872
From what I remember,

20:40.402 --> 20:42.686
you like things quick and clean.

20:43.003 --> 20:45.079
For once, I don't want to feel detached.

20:45.524 --> 20:48.034
Yassine lets me level
the score how I see fit.

20:49.760 --> 20:51.354
Yassine!

20:54.135 --> 20:56.127
Do you think he cares about you?

20:57.589 --> 20:59.585
You're just an attack dog.

21:00.791 --> 21:03.714
Sent over here to do his meathead work.

21:45.219 --> 21:46.330
You and me,

21:47.191 --> 21:48.629
we are the same.

21:50.279 --> 21:51.920
Disposable.

22:14.160 --> 22:15.347
Thanks for coming down.

22:16.128 --> 22:17.197
No problem.

22:19.402 --> 22:20.872
It's this formal now?

22:22.720 --> 22:24.107
Should I have my lawyer with me?

22:24.227 --> 22:26.155
No, not a all, Mr Bastière.

22:26.275 --> 22:27.413
We're just having a chat,

22:27.533 --> 22:28.676
at this stage.

22:30.927 --> 22:33.841
Do you ever meet to discuss
work matters with DCI Kendrick

22:34.030 --> 22:35.987
at the snooker club on Milford Street?

22:36.754 --> 22:37.619
Yes.

22:38.529 --> 22:40.615
And as much as it was social,

22:40.643 --> 22:42.152
a drink after work,

22:42.600 --> 22:45.340
with Kendrick, other police officers.

22:45.359 --> 22:46.250
It's a cops pub.

22:46.929 --> 22:49.398
We understand he met
several associates there.

22:51.952 --> 22:54.549
Does the name Eddie Morbury
mean anything to you?

22:55.916 --> 22:57.302
Douglas Trencham?

22:58.202 --> 22:59.900
- Karl Blakeley?
- No.

23:00.746 --> 23:02.213
How about Nelson Clay?

23:06.152 --> 23:08.073
Should I know any of these names?

23:08.480 --> 23:10.240
I can't divulge too much.

23:10.755 --> 23:13.739
These people are long-term targets for us.

23:23.128 --> 23:25.758
Can you tell me if you
recognize any of these people?

23:25.995 --> 23:26.936
And take your time.

23:32.394 --> 23:33.771
This one maybe.

23:34.377 --> 23:36.831
Possibly another police officer?

23:38.638 --> 23:42.106
DCI Kendrick's real skill
was his network of informants.

23:42.720 --> 23:45.062
Especially those with
former links to Eddie Morbury

23:45.095 --> 23:46.207
or Nelson Clay.

23:47.290 --> 23:51.192
All known to frequent the snooker club
with Kendrick at one time or another.

23:53.009 --> 23:54.418
It's a wretched position,

23:54.840 --> 23:56.026
informant.

23:56.594 --> 23:58.594
Always the threat of danger.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.285
And when exposed,

24:02.941 --> 24:04.459
they can disappear.

24:23.819 --> 24:25.938
We believe all these men to be missing.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.158
Possibly dead.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.727
Bodies never recovered.

24:36.339 --> 24:38.410
No, I've never seen any of them before.

24:42.275 --> 24:43.391
Is that everything?

24:53.844 --> 24:57.495
It was a very cloudy world,
Kendrick moved in, Mr Bastière.

24:57.615 --> 24:58.517
Jean.

24:59.400 --> 25:00.886
So I can totally understand

25:00.929 --> 25:03.223
if a person might feel nervous talking.

25:04.685 --> 25:07.152
But I'm keen to reassure you or anyone

25:07.182 --> 25:09.400
who can help with my investigation,

25:09.602 --> 25:11.366
that I would give my full support.

25:11.486 --> 25:12.550
No matter what.

25:16.517 --> 25:17.425
Thank you.

25:28.426 --> 25:29.821
Oh! Fuck!

25:34.112 --> 25:37.067
She's not wasting much time
trying to make new friends.

25:38.681 --> 25:40.190
I'm just looking out for you.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.727
With Kendrick gone, I still need
to know what they think of me.

25:43.736 --> 25:45.363
So what does she have to say for herself?

25:45.807 --> 25:46.616
Nothing.

25:50.187 --> 25:52.216
My dealings with Kendrick.

25:52.831 --> 25:54.200
Payments for work.

25:54.364 --> 25:55.527
Unimportant.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.342
I don't think I'm interesting to them.

26:01.288 --> 26:03.861
She's obviously got a bee in her bonnet.

26:14.186 --> 26:15.993
Your old tags needs sorting.

26:46.383 --> 26:47.338
Nico:

26:47.835 --> 26:49.046
"How is it going?"

26:50.545 --> 26:52.040
Expects updates?

26:52.360 --> 26:54.239
He should stick to what he does best,

26:54.610 --> 26:56.581
balls deep in some whore.

26:57.995 --> 26:59.797
All the time in London,

27:01.008 --> 27:02.545
he disappears...

27:05.407 --> 27:07.124
Then, comes back...

27:08.959 --> 27:10.297
reeking of sex.

27:10.685 --> 27:11.938
No class.

27:14.719 --> 27:15.878
And the women...

27:18.726 --> 27:20.854
Filthy street bitches.

27:24.235 --> 27:25.716
You're kidding me, right?

27:26.780 --> 27:27.532
Why?

27:29.169 --> 27:30.214
You don't know?

27:30.616 --> 27:31.401
What?

27:32.665 --> 27:34.401
Your boy is a cock jockey.

27:36.431 --> 27:37.632
He likes dick.

27:39.056 --> 27:41.280
You remember, his "cousin",

27:41.317 --> 27:42.925
on a job in Bordeaux?

27:43.929 --> 27:45.240
Nico's gay.

27:51.558 --> 27:52.991
What a pity!

27:54.127 --> 27:56.180
What do you care, where he puts it,

27:56.227 --> 27:58.034
as long as it makes him happy?

27:58.080 --> 28:00.101
I don't give a shit about that.

28:00.858 --> 28:03.200
But when Yassine finds out,

28:04.240 --> 28:06.515
they'll cut his throat.

28:07.944 --> 28:09.011
Anything

28:09.131 --> 28:11.861
that has the stench of weakness.

28:13.956 --> 28:15.091
You know that.

28:15.600 --> 28:16.898
I remember.

28:37.553 --> 28:39.473
I keep on landing on my keys.

28:40.088 --> 28:41.526
Three condoms?

28:41.857 --> 28:43.097
You're an optimist.

28:43.217 --> 28:44.724
I never leave the house

28:44.965 --> 28:46.615
without my jacket, man.

28:47.840 --> 28:49.543
Is that what life's about for you?

28:52.599 --> 28:54.576
You tell me something as important.

28:56.733 --> 28:59.808
If you were ever late, or if
we couldn't find you, always

29:00.341 --> 29:02.195
a woman was involved.

29:04.224 --> 29:06.518
What's the record for missing in action?

29:08.074 --> 29:09.167
Eight days?

29:17.666 --> 29:19.288
Some of us are cursed.

29:21.847 --> 29:23.677
As the saying goes,

29:24.628 --> 29:28.653
there is more pull in one
single hair of a woman's vagina,

29:29.216 --> 29:31.529
than there is in a thousand horses.

29:40.913 --> 29:41.636
Fuck...

29:43.524 --> 29:45.931
- Your ulcers?
- That's fucking killing me.

29:58.272 --> 30:01.204
Milk and rum, it's good for your stomach.

30:03.928 --> 30:05.914
What is she, 20, 25?

30:06.671 --> 30:09.859
- I bet she bangs like a fucking...
- She's my daughter!

30:10.474 --> 30:11.945
You fucking animal.

30:25.480 --> 30:27.470
- I didn't know you had a daughter.
- What?

30:27.487 --> 30:29.545
And swap family photos and Christmas cards?

30:30.920 --> 30:32.345
In this business, I...

30:32.529 --> 30:34.265
I need something just for me.

30:34.762 --> 30:37.188
I tell myself I do this for her.

30:38.160 --> 30:41.744
But by the time you realize your
child cares nothing about it...

30:44.806 --> 30:46.272
she's grown.

30:48.341 --> 30:50.380
It's always later than you think.

30:53.236 --> 30:55.222
Last year, she got married.

30:58.036 --> 31:00.354
Her stepfather gave her away.

31:06.976 --> 31:08.537
He's a good man.

31:12.522 --> 31:14.679
Smart enough to be wary of me.

31:16.453 --> 31:18.055
Do you have kids?

31:20.071 --> 31:21.017
No.

31:21.685 --> 31:22.632
Really?

31:26.002 --> 31:28.290
With the amount of pussy you've conquered?

31:30.910 --> 31:32.293
You can go.

31:33.653 --> 31:36.745
You can go home and tell
Yassine that the job is done.

31:38.052 --> 31:40.488
I promise you will never see me again.

31:42.840 --> 31:45.272
Like I said, it's always
later than you think.

31:46.342 --> 31:48.015
Now you're a philosopher.

31:48.033 --> 31:50.156
Consider time with your daughter.

31:52.184 --> 31:54.460
Living your life in a way that matters.

31:56.665 --> 31:58.947
If you had any kind of smarts,

31:59.663 --> 32:01.280
you'd realize,

32:02.022 --> 32:04.936
death is the best option for you.

32:11.839 --> 32:13.450
Who'd cry for you?

32:15.501 --> 32:16.950
Nobody cares.

32:17.720 --> 32:19.179
You don't matter.

32:23.080 --> 32:24.346
I matter.

32:29.806 --> 32:33.607
Your mother should have strangled you
with the umbilical cordon at birth.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.308
- Don't talk about my mother.
- Oh...

32:36.880 --> 32:39.223
Ah, the Mommy issues.

32:39.343 --> 32:42.847
Was she sucking somebody's cock
instead of taking care of you?

32:52.755 --> 32:54.044
Die!

33:24.250 --> 33:27.100
Oh, there you are. I've
been waiting outside.

33:27.307 --> 33:28.732
Come on, you're ready to go?

33:29.767 --> 33:32.670
Hi, Mrs Bastière, I wonder
if I might have a word.

33:32.924 --> 33:33.815
Of course.

33:41.554 --> 33:42.960
"Pallor mortis:

33:43.001 --> 33:46.714
paleness which happens in the
15 to 20 minutes after death. "

33:47.012 --> 33:48.246
"Livor mortis:

33:48.260 --> 33:51.884
a settling of the blood in the
lower dependent parts of the body. "

33:51.920 --> 33:54.344
- "Avoiding of the bowels is to be... "
- OK.

33:54.348 --> 33:56.120
All right, I get the picture.

33:56.175 --> 33:57.660
Mrs Bastière,

33:58.644 --> 34:00.342
in my experience,

34:00.360 --> 34:02.381
when a boy of Oliver's age,

34:02.400 --> 34:05.280
- shows an unhealthy interest in...
- What's unhealthy?

34:06.047 --> 34:08.710
I mean, OK, maybe... but...

34:08.975 --> 34:11.670
most of this if probably
copied from Wikipedia, and...

34:13.837 --> 34:15.620
I... I'll talk to him, but...

34:16.159 --> 34:18.029
I don't want to make
this bigger than it is.

34:20.567 --> 34:21.418
Well...

34:22.322 --> 34:23.859
This isn't everything.

34:25.320 --> 34:27.556
It's what he's been
telling the other children

34:27.960 --> 34:29.856
about what his father does for a living...

34:47.800 --> 34:49.840
Thank you for seeing me, Mrs Kendrick.

34:50.692 --> 34:52.286
Everyone's been so kind.

34:53.024 --> 34:56.501
I'm sorry for making you
come all the way out here.

34:56.973 --> 35:00.161
I'm just not ready to go back
there. I just can't face it.

35:01.220 --> 35:03.150
I'm sorry I couldn't make the funeral.

35:04.191 --> 35:05.751
There were 200 people.

35:06.276 --> 35:07.875
Friends, colleagues...

35:08.720 --> 35:11.076
And a few days later,
some of the same old faces

35:11.077 --> 35:13.427
come crushing through the house like...

35:15.000 --> 35:16.190
They took everything.

35:16.629 --> 35:18.020
Computer. Files.

35:18.140 --> 35:20.200
They even took some of his clothes.

35:20.320 --> 35:22.111
Like it didn't mean anything.

35:22.670 --> 35:26.310
I can't imagine. Losing Tom and then...

35:26.596 --> 35:29.542
- The shock of the investigation.
- I'm not stupid.

35:32.063 --> 35:33.600
Four holidays a year?

35:33.967 --> 35:35.720
The necklace he bought me for Christmas.

35:35.752 --> 35:38.560
Like all that's possible
on a police salary.

35:40.895 --> 35:43.990
I just thought him clever
enough not to get caught.

35:49.061 --> 35:50.314
He liked you.

35:52.005 --> 35:53.566
He thought you were decent.

35:54.436 --> 35:56.972
Why shouldn't you all
get something extra, hmm?

35:58.864 --> 36:00.000
So...

36:00.920 --> 36:04.132
Is DCI Squire all over you too now?

36:05.692 --> 36:06.816
There...

36:06.936 --> 36:08.654
have been questions, yeah.

36:17.080 --> 36:18.794
Does the name Fallowfield

36:18.812 --> 36:20.124
mean anything to you?

36:21.732 --> 36:23.925
Fallowfield's got nothing to do with work.

36:25.906 --> 36:28.619
No doubt he got all misty-eyed in the pub.

36:28.631 --> 36:31.061
He always talked about
it after a drink or two.

36:46.363 --> 36:48.042
Taken on our honeymoon.

36:48.634 --> 36:51.840
South Downs. Ten days
in a run-down cottage.

36:53.919 --> 36:55.208
Above the door.

36:56.560 --> 36:58.057
The name of the cottage.

37:00.658 --> 37:02.160
Fallowfield.

37:03.355 --> 37:05.796
We decided if it ever came up for sale...

37:06.151 --> 37:07.564
Luckily it did.

37:08.665 --> 37:09.930
He loved that place.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.833
He was doing it up, bit by bit.

37:13.796 --> 37:17.675
It was... his escape, away from everything.

37:21.287 --> 37:22.659
It's empty now.

37:25.018 --> 37:27.453
Something else that's got to be dealt with.

37:44.191 --> 37:46.030
- What the fuck have you done?
- Hey.

37:55.424 --> 37:57.280
You should be dead. Not him!

37:57.499 --> 37:58.616
Shit!

38:00.135 --> 38:02.027
What am I supposed to do now, uh?

38:04.400 --> 38:06.290
- You can save yourself.
- Shut up!

38:11.097 --> 38:12.126
They know.

38:13.190 --> 38:14.314
They know.

38:14.840 --> 38:17.080
- Yassine, Romain, they know.
- Know what?

38:18.653 --> 38:20.291
They know that you're gay.

38:21.479 --> 38:23.081
This is bullshit!

38:24.058 --> 38:25.518
I'm not a faggot!

38:27.475 --> 38:30.509
"Anything that has the
stench of weakness... "

38:31.349 --> 38:32.678
That's what he said.

38:38.851 --> 38:40.317
Fucking asshole!

38:43.519 --> 38:44.588
They will kill you.

38:45.080 --> 38:46.116
I'm not going back.

38:47.161 --> 38:48.353
That's good.

38:49.739 --> 38:50.879
I'm staying here.

38:51.069 --> 38:52.218
I love London.

38:52.492 --> 38:54.181
Yeah, that's right.

38:56.518 --> 38:58.192
I could do something different here.

38:58.244 --> 38:59.715
Like cook in the restaurant.

38:59.720 --> 39:01.367
- That's your dream?
- Yes.

39:01.603 --> 39:02.805
I love it.

39:03.292 --> 39:04.701
It's expressive but free,

39:04.821 --> 39:06.910
whether you're straight or gay.

39:07.247 --> 39:08.391
Yeah, whatever.

39:08.656 --> 39:09.919
You think I could?

39:10.098 --> 39:10.912
Uh?

39:16.770 --> 39:17.607
Thank you.

39:24.460 --> 39:25.710
You're welcome, mate.

39:36.522 --> 39:38.040
Your teacher was worried.

39:39.441 --> 39:41.139
About what you said to the other boys.

39:42.610 --> 39:43.924
I didn't lie.

39:43.976 --> 39:45.381
No, nobody's saying you did.

39:45.769 --> 39:46.951
It was the truth.

39:47.071 --> 39:49.241
Charlie was showing off about his dad.

39:49.751 --> 39:51.137
He's a pilot.

39:51.397 --> 39:53.005
I said that was boring

39:53.312 --> 39:55.403
that what my dad does is better.

39:55.862 --> 39:57.451
He works with the police.

39:57.499 --> 39:58.927
He tidies away dead bodies,

39:59.047 --> 40:00.663
once that have been killed.

40:01.878 --> 40:04.328
Now that's not... that's not exactly true.

40:05.297 --> 40:06.839
Or left for ages.

40:08.240 --> 40:10.448
Can you see why that might upset people?

40:11.319 --> 40:12.790
If you talk about it.

40:16.182 --> 40:17.639
And you're gonna tell Dad?

40:19.441 --> 40:20.988
No, I don't have to,

40:21.461 --> 40:22.572
if you don't want me to.

40:23.589 --> 40:25.722
As long as you promise
to talk to me about...

40:27.175 --> 40:28.083
anything.

40:29.884 --> 40:31.630
Can I have some more ketchup?

40:44.760 --> 40:45.682
Light finish,

40:45.687 --> 40:48.038
won't block your pores, and
the tint is really subtle.

40:48.075 --> 40:49.943
He won't be able to take his eyes off you.

40:50.133 --> 40:51.240
Like they ever notice.

40:51.273 --> 40:52.858
This one sounds like he would.

40:52.939 --> 40:55.480
- French and rich.
- I didn't say he was rich.

40:55.600 --> 40:57.309
I'd get a ring on it pronto.

40:58.440 --> 40:59.754
He's already married.

41:03.013 --> 41:04.536
There we go, all done.

41:05.808 --> 41:07.005
Thank you.

41:08.329 --> 41:09.658
I'll take the lipstick.

41:10.249 --> 41:11.195
Great.

41:17.240 --> 41:18.976
That's £20, then.

41:19.813 --> 41:20.967
Thank you.

41:26.287 --> 41:28.018
They never leave their wives,

41:28.448 --> 41:29.962
whatever bullshit they tell you.

41:30.430 --> 41:31.981
I really don't want him to.

41:40.083 --> 41:42.008
I did what you asked.

41:42.128 --> 41:45.173
I didn't ask you to kill people.
I asked you for protection.

41:46.370 --> 41:49.770
Yes, and I'm very good at it.
Look, I protected you to death!

41:50.002 --> 41:51.250
He didn't need to die.

41:51.468 --> 41:53.614
What should I have done?
Give him a teddy bear?

41:53.734 --> 41:55.080
Tell him his mother loved him?

41:55.200 --> 41:56.703
He was about to kill you.

41:56.868 --> 41:58.400
I was handling him.

41:58.419 --> 42:00.557
Well, it didn't look like
it from where I was standing.

42:01.522 --> 42:02.378
Forget it.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.153
Fuck this!

42:06.692 --> 42:08.352
I saved your life.

42:10.192 --> 42:11.673
I'll help you with these two.

42:12.400 --> 42:13.617
And then you're on your own.

42:20.339 --> 42:21.639
You look exhausted.

42:22.590 --> 42:23.654
Hard day?

42:24.643 --> 42:25.656
The usual.

42:31.204 --> 42:32.566
Diner in half an hour?

42:35.720 --> 42:36.398
What?

42:37.765 --> 42:38.621
Sure.

43:52.822 --> 43:56.071
Am I supposed to keep up the pretense
that there's nothing going on?

44:00.760 --> 44:02.101
About finances.

44:02.815 --> 44:04.040
There's nothing going on.

44:06.159 --> 44:07.583
I'd tell you if there was.

44:08.013 --> 44:09.466
I don't think you would.

44:11.023 --> 44:12.191
Not these days.

44:13.217 --> 44:14.423
I'm just tired.

44:16.108 --> 44:16.935
OK.

44:18.789 --> 44:21.177
Oh, come on, don't be like this.

44:22.085 --> 44:23.868
Just because I'm tired there's something?

44:32.520 --> 44:34.159
I don't think I can trust you.

44:34.528 --> 44:35.583
Not anymore.

44:39.390 --> 44:40.970
What is that supposed to mean?

44:43.945 --> 44:44.829
Huh?

44:47.320 --> 44:49.565
- Don't ***!
- No, get your hands off me!

47:02.960 --> 47:04.928
Was it those horrible French men?

47:07.667 --> 47:09.800
There was a plane crash, and...

47:09.920 --> 47:11.379
I rescued everyone.

47:12.227 --> 47:13.806
You did that one before.

47:14.728 --> 47:17.765
Children, animals, a koala.

47:18.409 --> 47:19.411
That's right.

47:21.707 --> 47:24.299
But only because I'm a superhero, remember?

47:24.672 --> 47:27.283
There's no such thing as superheroes.

47:27.481 --> 47:29.529
That's just made-up stories.

47:30.196 --> 47:32.410
Men in silly costumes.

47:33.800 --> 47:37.286
Well, maybe sometimes the made-up
stories are better than the real ones.

47:42.721 --> 47:43.923
What is this?

47:47.664 --> 47:49.007
Burglars came.

47:50.090 --> 47:51.816
Made this man angry,

47:51.936 --> 47:53.755
so he shot them.

47:53.800 --> 47:55.954
And, now they're all dead.

47:57.193 --> 47:57.969
Well...

47:59.672 --> 48:00.996
It's OK, we...

48:01.215 --> 48:02.758
- we can fix them.
- No!

48:03.361 --> 48:05.188
They'd been murdered,

48:05.988 --> 48:07.880
because they were baddies.

48:08.489 --> 48:09.565
So,

48:10.280 --> 48:12.590
- it's good they're dead.
- What?

48:14.496 --> 48:16.229
I don't want you to talk like that.

48:19.772 --> 48:21.215
Once a man,

48:22.965 --> 48:24.407
kill another man,

48:25.590 --> 48:28.445
it's not just the man
who dies that suffers.

48:30.183 --> 48:31.760
I said don't!

48:37.336 --> 48:39.825
I think it's time for you
to go to bed, all right?

51:03.731 --> 51:04.895
Julie?

51:05.950 --> 51:07.691
All right, dear, is everything all right?

51:09.880 --> 51:11.200
You tell me.

53:24.451 --> 53:25.851
Now this is what happens,

53:25.861 --> 53:28.206
when you make the decision to be dishonest!

53:28.221 --> 53:30.675
- Speak to anybody, I swear...!
- Didn't your mother ever tell ya,

53:30.689 --> 53:32.983
honesty is the best fucking policy!

53:33.352 --> 53:35.480
No, Victor!

53:43.389 --> 53:45.054
What do you got to say?

53:59.120 --> 54:00.147
Jesus.

54:13.265 --> 54:14.767
Get out!

54:15.080 --> 54:17.091
Get out!

54:17.820 --> 54:19.895
Martin!

54:24.705 --> 54:26.526
Martin!
