To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

but secretly, with the help
of my friends at 8. TA R. Labs,

00:13.347 --> 00:16.430
I ﬁght crime
and ﬁnd other meta-humans like me.

00:16.934 --> 00:18.765
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

00:18.936 --> 00:22.269

I opened up our world to new threats.

I would not say anything to her

11:55.924 --> 11:57.380
Maybe he could help us somehow.

11:57.759 --> 11:58.885
Or not.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.885
Um, looks like he died when the
particle accelerator exploded.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.340
I'IIIH [:1 ol-IIIIIIJIII-IIMI

12:04.016 --> 12:05.677
Uh, he's got a widow, Dr. Tanya Lamden.

12:05.851 --> 12:07.842
She's a research scientist
at Nautilus Labs,

12:08.020 --> 12:11.012
and she studies. wait for it, sharks.

12:11.523 --> 12:12.808
Okay, well, maybe the two of you can go

12:12.983 --> 12:15.645
and see if she's discovered anything
in her research that could help us?

12:15.819 --> 12:17.104
-Yeah.
-Sure.

12:17.279 --> 12:18.359
[m

12:20.991 --> 12:21.980
-Hey, Dig.
-Yeah.

12:22.159 --> 12:24.616
-HoW's that helmet treating you?
-It could use some improvements.

12:25.287 --> 12:26.402
I'll get to work on it.

12:26.705 --> 12:27.820
Hey, Joe, what's up?

12:27.998 --> 12:29.408
Hey, Barr, I talked to Wally.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.198
-He wants to meet up with you.
-All right.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.708
He's working on his engineering project
at our place tonight.

12:33.879 --> 12:36.416
He would love some help
from that big brain of yours.

12:36.632 --> 12:39.214
Okay, Joe, look, I'm sony.
Right now is kind of a crazy time.

12:39.384 --> 12:40.544
Why? What's going on?

12:40.719 --> 12:44.587
Remember that meta-human shark
that Patty was after and attacked me?

12:44.765 --> 12:47.677
-He's back? I thought Wells, you know.
-Yeah, me too.

12:47.851 --> 12:49.967
But apparently, A.R.G.U.S. had him
and he escaped.

12:50.145 --> 12:51.601
And now he's heading for Central City.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.805
I get it. Uh, I'll tell Wally
some other time.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.562
Hey, you know what? Um, it's all good.

12:58.737 --> 13:01.479
I'll make it work.
Tell him tonight should be ﬁne.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.821
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.983
-Thanks, Barr.
-Yeah, bye.

13:08.413 --> 13:09.402
(SIGHS)

13:10.165 --> 13:11.200
Why?

13:14.711 --> 13:17.544
It's been two years
since your particle accelerator exploded.

13:17.714 --> 13:21.172
Seems a little late to be asking questions
about my husband, doesn't it?

13:21.718 --> 13:23.754
Your husband passed away
from cancer. correct?

13:24.888 --> 13:26.424
I suppose you could say that.

13:26.932 --> 13:30.345
It only took three days for every cell
in his body to grow uncontrollably.

13:31.269 --> 13:35.933
Whatever cancer he had.
it turned him into something not human.

13:36.358 --> 13:37.848
Well, that's why we're here, actually.

13:38.026 --> 13:39.562
There's a meta-human in Central City

13:39.736 --> 13:43.399
whose body seems to be mutating
in the same way as your late husband.

13:43.740 --> 13:46.573
But he didn't die,
he became a dangerous monster.

13:46.868 --> 13:48.779
My husband was no monster.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.736
That's not what she was implying.

13:51.289 --> 13:52.574
mmmmmmm:

13:52.749 --> 13:54.956
We've read about the research
you're doing here on sharks.

13:55.127 --> 13:57.243
Mmm-hmm. Yeah,
I've had some encouraging results.

13:57.421 --> 13:58.957
Although, still preliminary.

13:59.464 --> 14:00.579
kv‘vl ill 3‘31. I I 0 Fl ;L;l i!

14:00.757 --> 14:02.133
I beg your pardon?

14:02.884 --> 14:03.964
Your research. All of it.

14:04.136 --> 14:06.843
What my colleague means to say is that

14:07.014 --> 14:09.505
if you could please let us
take a look at your ﬁndings,

14:09.683 --> 14:12.891
it could help us stop this meta-human
from hurting anyone.

14:14.271 --> 14:15.477
You're with S.T.A.R. Labs.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.263
I'm just supposed to trust you?

14:18.859 --> 14:22.272
Please, Mrs. Lamden.
This could help save lives.

14:24.448 --> 14:25.733
I'll e-mail you what I have.

14:27.325 --> 14:28.405
Thank you.

14:33.123 --> 14:34.238
“mama

14:34.416 --> 14:35.576
I was being direct.

14:35.751 --> 14:37.958
Yeah, well, that's one way to describe it.

14:38.462 --> 14:41.670
You've been acting differently toward me
ever since you got back from Earth-2.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.713
What's your problem, Cisco?

14:45.469 --> 14:46.629
Nothing.

14:47.262 --> 14:48.377
Let's just go.

14:59.191 --> 15:00.306
AGENT 1: Grid one, negative.

15:02.319 --> 15:03.934
AGENT 2: Grid four, negative.

15:10.494 --> 15:11.825
Status check. grid two.

15:11.995 --> 15:13.235
AGENT 3: Grid two, negative.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.495
-Anything?
-No, man. Nothing yet.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.497
So far, nothing on our end, either.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.828
I just hope Wells is doing
better than we are.

15:20.504 --> 15:21.914
Hey, hoW's Felicity doing?

15:23.006 --> 15:24.792
I'm not gonna lie, Barr.
It was pretty rough there at ﬁrst,

15:24.966 --> 15:27.673
but you know Felicity, she's tough.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.885
Yeah. She's just not
returning any of my calls.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.258
She has a lot going on right now.

15:34.518 --> 15:37.351
But hey, I'll ask her if she can give you
a call when this is all over.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.016
I just want to catch this thing, man.

15:40.190 --> 15:42.431
If everything to do with Zoom and Earth-2
are put behind us,

15:42.609 --> 15:45.066
we could just move on with our lives.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.560
You're starting to do that thing
Oliver does, Bany.

15:48.156 --> 15:50.112
Cany the weight of the world
on your shoulders.

15:51.493 --> 15:53.529
You gotta stop that, man.
or it's going to slow you down.

15:55.038 --> 15:56.198
Still nothing.

15:56.498 --> 15:58.363
Status check. grid six.

15:58.542 --> 16:00.203
AGENT 4: Hold on,
I think we got something.

16:06.174 --> 16:07.163
(GROWLING)

16:14.724 --> 16:17.056
LYLA: So much for cleaning up
after Waller's messes.

16:17.227 --> 16:18.387
We don't ﬁnd King Shark soon,

16:18.562 --> 16:20.393
someone's going to be
cleaning up after mine.

16:21.064 --> 16:22.304
We'll ﬁnd him, Lyla.

16:24.025 --> 16:26.607
All right.
I searched the whole area. he's gone.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.154
He couldn't have gotten far.

16:28.321 --> 16:31.984
Still. he knows we're here now.
We lost the element of surprise.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.737
Not if Wells can ﬁgure out a way
to track him.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.406
-In the meantime, we'll keep looking.
-All right.

16:37.622 --> 16:41.240
I'll meet up with you guys later.
I gotta go see Joe's son.

16:41.585 --> 16:43.746
Okay. I thought our relationship
was hard to follow.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.332
-(SCOFFS)
-See ya.

16:49.384 --> 16:51.340
He's fast. John. Get over it.

16:51.636 --> 16:52.751
1m

17:00.770 --> 17:02.931
Joe thought I should have you take a look.

17:05.066 --> 17:07.557
So, this is what I got so far

17:07.736 --> 17:10.648
for my project essay to get into
CCU's engineering program.

17:14.618 --> 17:15.949
Turbine supercars?

17:16.703 --> 17:18.443
Turbines. Like jet engines?

17:18.663 --> 17:20.494
Yeah. Yeah. it'd use
an engine like the ones

17:20.665 --> 17:23.623
they have in some helicopters.
only it'd run on biodiesel.

17:24.628 --> 17:26.243
-Cool.
-It's very cool.

17:26.630 --> 17:29.121
Yeah, you're gonna wanna address
the fuel economy issue here.

17:29.299 --> 17:31.961
I mean, it is a jet, so it's gonna
burn through a lot of fuel.

17:32.135 --> 17:34.626
Yeah. That's why I wanna use biodiesel.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.760
It'll run off of anything
that burns with oxygen.

17:37.265 --> 17:41.554
Okay, we also got a sound issue.
Gonna wake the neighbors for sure.

17:42.604 --> 17:43.639
Anything else?

17:45.857 --> 17:46.846
BARRY: Um...

17:48.401 --> 17:50.653
Well, I just want to help, you know.

17:50.820 --> 17:53.277
I'm just trying to make sure
they don't have any reason to say "no."

17:53.615 --> 17:55.446
Okay. (CHUCKLES)

17:56.618 --> 17:58.358
Sony, Wally, I didn't mean...

17:58.995 --> 18:00.576
I mean, it looks really good.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.991
All right, let's start over, okay?
(CHUCKLES)

18:06.503 --> 18:09.666
(STUTTERS) Why don't we go through it
all together? Work it out.

18:11.258 --> 18:12.873
-Sounds good.
-Cool.

18:22.644 --> 18:23.679
(CLEARS THROAT)

18:29.776 --> 18:31.892
This is a complete waste of time.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.895
We're not gonna ﬁnd anything
in Dr. Lamden's research

18:35.073 --> 18:36.859
to tell us how to ﬁnd King Shark.

18:38.118 --> 18:39.278
Maybe I should take a look?

18:39.452 --> 18:42.114
Oh, yeah, 'cause you're the doctor
with a specialty in biochem.

18:42.289 --> 18:46.202
I'm just saying maybe you could use
another set of eyes, considering...

18:47.627 --> 18:48.662
Considering what?

18:48.837 --> 18:50.543
Considering the way
you've been acting lately.

You are not yourself, Caitlin.

18:55.427 --> 18:58.635
And it's freaking me out
'cause you have this icy look in your eye

18:58.805 --> 19:00.136

19:11.067 --> 19:13.023
You met my doppelganger. didn't you?

-Because I'm not supposed to say anything.

Francisco Ramon,
if you don't start talking—

19:26.416 --> 19:29.499
Okay, ﬁnel Yes. I met your doppelganger.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.251
She's a coldhearted ice queen
named Killer Frost.

19:32.422 --> 19:35.209
A meta-human, who enjoyed killing, a lot.

19:35.884 --> 19:36.999
um

19:37.427 --> 19:40.590
Great. Now Hany's gonna kill me
and throw my stuff across the room.

19:40.764 --> 19:44.131
Cisco. I'm not a meta-human.

19:44.434 --> 19:47.926
Okay, I hear you, but you're acting
just like she did over there.

19:48.104 --> 19:51.221
You're being shut off,
you're being detached,

19:51.775 --> 19:52.981
you're being cold.

19:53.151 --> 19:54.937
Because I have to be right now.

19:55.695 --> 19:59.187
I just watched Jay get killed
right in front of my eyes.

20:00.617 --> 20:03.108
Just when I was starting to
feel normal again.

20:03.286 --> 20:05.618
Just when I was beginning to love him.

20:07.791 --> 20:10.157
So if I let myself feel,

20:10.377 --> 20:14.040
if I let all of that pain and anger out,

20:14.214 --> 20:16.170
it's never gonna stop.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.172
And that's not going to help me, either.

20:18.510 --> 20:20.466
So let's just get back to this research

20:20.637 --> 20:22.673
and ﬁgure out how to ﬁnd King Shark.

20:23.640 --> 20:24.720
Okay.

20:36.945 --> 20:38.151
Here you are.

20:39.072 --> 20:41.154
Yep, just like back home. Always working.

20:41.324 --> 20:43.189
I'm trying to relocate this King Shark.

20:43.660 --> 20:45.025
He's here? On this Earth?

20:45.995 --> 20:48.327

Zoom brought him here

20:49.040 --> 20:50.280

just like we are.

and so I have to ﬁgure this out

but now that I am,

21:15.275 --> 21:16.606
you don't want me here.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.570
Just let me help. Please.

21:25.201 --> 21:26.486
Grab a marker.

21:29.873 --> 21:31.113
Yeah, okay.

21:32.542 --> 21:35.158
WALLY: Hardest part was amping the torque
without increasing drag.

21:35.336 --> 21:36.746
A heavier engine would only
slow things down.

21:36.921 --> 21:38.627
But this streamlined version
should optimize

21:38.798 --> 21:40.584
both the torque and the horsepower.

21:41.384 --> 21:44.547
Yeah. I'm just worried
it won't be enough still.

21:44.888 --> 21:45.968
Here. let's do this.

21:46.139 --> 21:49.552
Use a one-to-one transfer gearbox
to drop the output shaft of the engine.

21:49.809 --> 21:53.142
Reverse rotation and send more power
to the torque converter.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.897
I didn't come here for you
to just do it for me.

21:58.776 --> 22:00.391

work on this together.

emotionally sucked in when I went there.

No. I don't have enough information

Anything that can help us?

28:57.361 --> 28:58.441
I didn't think so at ﬁrst,

28:58.613 --> 29:00.604
but then I found something
that I think might help us.

29:01.365 --> 29:02.445
Sharks are predators.

29:02.617 --> 29:03.652
In order to track their prey,

29:03.826 --> 29:06.033
they use what's known as
passive electro location.

29:06.203 --> 29:08.330
-Passive electro location?
-Yes, it's how they sense

29:08.497 --> 29:11.239
the bioelectric potential
around a ﬁsh's body.

29:11.417 --> 29:13.658
King Shark senses electricity
in Bany's system.

29:14.003 --> 29:16.494
Okay. That explains how
King Shark can track Bany.

29:16.672 --> 29:18.287
But how is that going to
help us track him?

29:18.466 --> 29:20.422
We ﬂip it.
Instead of King Shark being the predator,

29:20.593 --> 29:23.881
we make him the prey, and we track him
using active electro location.

29:24.055 --> 29:27.343
We reprogram our satellite to
generate a speciﬁc electric ﬁeld

29:27.516 --> 29:29.347
and then measure any
electrical distortions

29:29.518 --> 29:31.850
that correlate with a one-ton,
walking shark.

29:32.146 --> 29:33.807

and we'll take it from there.

30:14.772 --> 30:17.104

to knock him out for a month.

a lot easier to reel in.

38:08.954 --> 38:12.617
And he's not favored
over you, or Iris, or anybody else.

38:14.126 --> 38:15.957
So you have nothing to wony about.

38:17.880 --> 38:19.040
He's my son.

38:20.924 --> 38:22.175
Just like you are.

38:26.221 --> 38:27.927
What are you doing with those?

38:28.265 --> 38:31.883
I'm adjusting the wavelength trigger to
see if I can get these to work over here.

38:32.060 --> 38:33.925
So you can catch some breachers?

38:34.396 --> 38:37.638
(WINCES) Dear God, Caitlin,
your hands are freezingl

38:37.816 --> 38:41.229
"Caitlin." I've always hated that name.

38:42.070 --> 38:43.651
Oh, no!

38:43.822 --> 38:46.655
No, no, no. It's starting.
You're starting to become—

38:46.825 --> 38:48.281
.Iﬂlmmi

38:50.787 --> 38:52.038
(LAUGHS)

38:53.123 --> 38:54.238
That ain't right.

38:54.416 --> 38:56.577
That ain't right. That's just rude.
Who put you up to this?

38:56.752 --> 38:59.585
Bany put you up to this, didn't he?
Oh, I should've known.

38:59.755 --> 39:01.336
-You two are—
-Cold?

39:01.507 --> 39:02.622
man

39:02.925 --> 39:06.292
You deserve it for thinking that
I could ever become like her.

39:07.221 --> 39:09.507
Cisco. you need to stop wonying about me.

39:09.932 --> 39:12.639
I may be sad, I may want to be alone
for a little while,

39:12.809 --> 39:14.094
but I promise you

39:14.269 --> 39:17.761
Killer Frost will never exist
on this Earth, okay?

39:18.065 --> 39:21.398
Besides, you tested me.
I don't even have the meta-human gene.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.608
So please stop wonying about me. okay?

39:26.198 --> 39:27.278
Okay. (SOFT CHUCKLE)

39:28.283 --> 39:29.944
Come on. Bany wants us upstairs.

39:32.454 --> 39:34.319
For real though,
you gotta work on that circulation.

39:34.498 --> 39:36.659
You might have Raynaud's or something?
You know what Raynaud's is?

39:36.833 --> 39:37.993
I'm a doctor, Cisco.

39:40.587 --> 39:42.794
Hail, hail, the gang's all here.

39:43.340 --> 39:44.455
What's good?

39:45.300 --> 39:46.289
(SIGHS) Uh...

39:48.303 --> 39:50.794
I need to apologize to you all.

39:52.266 --> 39:53.255
Um...

39:54.268 --> 39:58.637
Last year, I made a choice
to go back in time

39:59.064 --> 40:00.304
and save my mother.

40:01.191 --> 40:04.183
rmnmmm

40:05.112 --> 40:08.104
a lot of consequences that will haunt me
for the rest of my life,

40:09.575 --> 40:11.190
just like I know
it haunts all of you, too.

40:15.497 --> 40:16.657
rm

40:18.500 --> 40:19.831
Jay's death.

40:28.135 --> 40:29.966
We're the ones
who opened the door to Earth-2.

40:30.137 --> 40:31.877
We're the ones who brought Zoom here.

40:32.681 --> 40:35.764
But we are also the ones
who are gonna stop him.

40:37.019 --> 40:38.225
mm

40:39.688 --> 40:41.394
How are we going to stop Zoom, Allen?

40:43.191 --> 40:44.317
I don't know yet.

40:48.488 --> 40:52.902
But those breaches aren't closed forever,
and we're not done with Earth-2.

40:58.957 --> 40:59.946
(SIGHS)

41:01.501 --> 41:03.366
Jay's death was not in vain.

41:05.631 --> 41:07.371
We will meet Zoom again.

41:08.216 --> 41:09.717
And the next time,

41:10.302 --> 41:11.508
mumm

41:13.388 --> 41:14.889
Inn-1mm

41:24.650 --> 41:25.935
W

41:35.577 --> 41:37.158
(SHUDDERING BREATHS)

41:48.757 --> 41:53.751
Well, this is a complication.

42:26.336 --> 42:27.371
