00:03.840 --> 00:07.190
It was your fingerprints mixed
with your mother's blood.

00:07.240 --> 00:10.910
I didn't kill her. She was
alive when I left the house.

00:10.960 --> 00:12.190
I am the man in the car.

00:12.240 --> 00:13.750
Jack Argyll's alibi.

00:13.800 --> 00:15.590
Arthur, I'd like to buy you dinner.

00:15.640 --> 00:19.910
You're too late, Jack died before
the case could come to trial.

00:19.960 --> 00:22.070
- Jack was adopted.
- God, yes. They all are.

00:22.120 --> 00:26.390
- I would like to say thank you for
agreeing to be my wife. - No...

00:26.440 --> 00:28.630
I'm not able to discuss my work.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.030
Official secrets.

00:30.080 --> 00:32.630
The whole bloody family are suspects.

00:32.680 --> 00:35.230
No-one hated her more than you.

00:35.280 --> 00:39.150
- Filth! - Jack's brother
came to see me. - I need to go.

00:39.200 --> 00:44.070
If Leo Argyll wants you gone,
he'll have to pay big, 50-50 split.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.230
That's extortion.

00:45.280 --> 00:48.030
Which one of them has got
blood on their hands?

00:48.080 --> 00:50.310
- Rachel.
- To Rachel.

02:00.360 --> 02:01.750
He didn't do it. He's innocent.

02:01.800 --> 02:05.280
No, no! I'm damned, I'm damned.

02:48.360 --> 02:51.270
- You can't be here, you really can't.
- I need to speak to your father.

02:51.320 --> 02:54.030
- I'll wait until he's awake.
- If this is fun for you, it's not for us.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.470
We've been through hell, you
don't know what that's like.

02:56.520 --> 02:57.720
I know what hell is like.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.840
For Christ's sake...

03:02.600 --> 03:05.700
- I need to make your father listen to me!
- Shut up and get in the car.

03:08.120 --> 03:09.560
Why won't you let me help?

03:11.200 --> 03:12.200
Back in the house.

04:07.120 --> 04:10.840
So, did any of the men
try to flirt with you?

04:12.360 --> 04:13.360
Of course not.

04:14.440 --> 04:15.640
They must be blind.

04:20.519 --> 04:22.230
Your father enjoyed himself.

04:22.280 --> 04:25.150
Despite that odd little
chap turning up yesterday.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.110
He seemed to.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.720
That's what matters, isn't it?

04:30.480 --> 04:34.630
You know, I'm going to do all I can
to make your father's wedding day

04:34.680 --> 04:36.440
- memorable.
- You're in a good mood.

04:37.960 --> 04:39.840
I am, aren't I?

04:47.360 --> 04:50.470
Excuse me. I know I am too late for
your brother, but I can still help.

04:50.520 --> 04:51.630
I can clear his name.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.980
Leave my family alone.
Leave my brother alone.

04:55.600 --> 04:56.600
Next one.

04:58.080 --> 05:01.630
- It's as if you want him to be guilty.
- Don't tell me what I want.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.510
- That hurt. - It's meant to.
- Why don't you believe me?

05:04.560 --> 05:06.350
I'm telling the truth, Jack was innocent.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.110
Why come straight to
us and not the police?

05:08.160 --> 05:11.110
- I came to... - Shut up. It's
because you're not telling the truth.

05:11.160 --> 05:14.310
Not one bit of it - who you
are, where you've been - is true.

05:14.360 --> 05:16.550
- You're fake.
- I...

05:16.600 --> 05:18.160
I don't enjoy doing this.

05:19.600 --> 05:22.150
OK? It's not fun for me.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.440
But I will keep doing it.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.320
Be told.

06:35.360 --> 06:37.800
That man came back, Doctor Calgary.

06:39.080 --> 06:40.780
He was outside the house waiting.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.000
Mickey said not to tell anyone.

06:45.760 --> 06:47.520
Then why are you telling me?

06:50.320 --> 06:51.600
Daddy, I suppose.

06:53.720 --> 06:55.630
Why do you think he came back?

06:55.680 --> 06:56.880
That's what vultures do.

06:58.520 --> 06:59.920
They keep coming back.

07:01.040 --> 07:03.750
To peck at the bones until
there's nothing left.

07:03.800 --> 07:07.030
I think such terrible
things sometimes, Tina.

07:07.080 --> 07:09.550
What I'd like to do to people.

07:09.600 --> 07:13.550
Smash their faces in, so
they're just blood and teeth.

07:13.600 --> 07:17.150
- Anyone can snap, can't they? Really do this...
- Stop. You have to stop.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.990
I could've killed her that
night for what she did.

07:20.040 --> 07:24.990
♪ I'm dreaming of a white... ♪

07:25.040 --> 07:26.200
I want Daddy.

07:27.320 --> 07:28.840
♪ .. Christmas

07:30.520 --> 07:33.230
♪ Just like the ones I... ♪

07:33.280 --> 07:35.190
I wanted to kill her, I wanted her dead.

07:35.240 --> 07:37.540
You have to stop this.
You have to, because I...

07:42.160 --> 07:43.160
I just can't.

08:05.680 --> 08:08.440
Hester, run along to get dressed.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.870
It's done. He left early.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.220
That's a relief. Thank you.

08:18.600 --> 08:22.430
Yes, that Calgary chap said
that you'd pay him a visit.

08:22.480 --> 08:24.550
- Told him to leave.
- You didn't tell me that.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.070
You actually spoke to them?

08:26.120 --> 08:28.350
Well, it isn't as if I can
walk away, darling, is it?

08:28.400 --> 08:31.510
But he did rather sound as if
you'd threatened him, Michael.

08:31.560 --> 08:33.710
- Well, I didn't.
- Well, I just hope nobody overheard him.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.110
He's an excitable fella.

08:35.159 --> 08:39.110
He's so desperate to be believed
and tell his story, as it were.

08:39.159 --> 08:41.110
Do you know, the waiters
had to pull him off me.

08:41.159 --> 08:42.710
- What?
- He sounds rather volatile,

08:42.760 --> 08:45.310
and I think it's a very good thing
that Mickey did go and see him.

08:45.360 --> 08:47.470
You wouldn't want anything
disturbing the wedding.

08:47.520 --> 08:52.070
- No, we wouldn't.
- Muddying the waters, raking up the dirt.

08:52.120 --> 08:56.030
- You really are a first-rate son.
- He is.

08:56.080 --> 08:59.310
Now, let's have breakfast.

08:59.360 --> 09:01.910
I just can't help thinking,
that at the very least,

09:01.960 --> 09:04.590
you should tell the police
about this chap, Leo.

09:04.640 --> 09:06.430
I think they'll be very interested.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.630
Appearing after all this time.

09:08.680 --> 09:10.710
Not to mention, the papers.

09:10.760 --> 09:15.350
I mean, we all want to be beyond reproach,
don't we, in this tragic, tragic matter?

09:15.400 --> 09:20.600
And warning Doctor Calgary off does
not appear to be beyond reproach.

09:20.720 --> 09:21.720
Quite the opposite.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.510
Don't you think?

09:25.560 --> 09:27.030
Do you know what I think?

09:27.080 --> 09:29.750
I think it's a fucking shame that
you got out of that car crash alive.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.870
Don't you say that to him, don't you dare.

09:31.920 --> 09:34.960
Something on your mind, Mickey? Hm?

09:36.760 --> 09:39.800
Where were you on the
night of Rachel's murder?

09:41.040 --> 09:43.590
- At work.
- Who works Christmas eve night?

09:43.640 --> 09:46.510
You and Saint Nick? It's where he lived.

09:46.560 --> 09:49.430
- Of course, he was there.
- Oh, she's piped up.

09:49.480 --> 09:51.110
The faithful retainer.

09:51.160 --> 09:53.750
It's always the servants
that know more than they say.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.320
Philip, be very careful.

09:59.920 --> 10:02.630
How are you getting along with the
old reading and writing now that

10:02.680 --> 10:04.310
there's no-one to help you?

10:04.360 --> 10:08.680
All right as long as it's
short words and big letters?

10:10.400 --> 10:12.510
Well, at least I can get it up.

10:12.560 --> 10:14.230
No wonder Mary's gone out of her head.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.670
Stuck with you sponging off her and not
even a decent shafting for her trouble.

10:17.720 --> 10:22.190
- I hate you. - Michael...
- I hate you, I hate you!

10:22.240 --> 10:25.870
I'm trying to eat my grapefruit, actually. Actually,
just trying to eat my grapefruit in peace.

10:25.920 --> 10:28.720
- Eat your bloody grapefruit,
I'm not stopping you. - Enough!

10:32.920 --> 10:35.950
You insufferable little prick.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.270
I used to hurt men like you.

10:37.320 --> 10:38.560
- Thrashed.
- Used to?

10:40.080 --> 10:42.120
Not thrashing anything any more, are you?

10:44.920 --> 10:47.550
Can I just say that this subject
matter and this language is not

10:47.600 --> 10:50.510
fit for the breakfast table or
any other table for that matter?

10:50.560 --> 10:52.510
Oh, don't be coy, Gwenda.

10:52.560 --> 10:57.110
We all know that you were riding Leo
like a seaside donkey while Rachel

10:57.160 --> 11:00.000
was still alive. Probably
on this sodding table.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.440
I know this is about money.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.480
I'm not increasing Mary's allowance.

11:16.640 --> 11:21.390
So this cruel game you're
playing needs to stop...

11:21.440 --> 11:22.440
.. now.

11:27.840 --> 11:29.080
Well...

11:39.480 --> 11:40.760
Where were you?

11:43.520 --> 11:45.390
When?

11:45.440 --> 11:46.440
You know when.

11:48.480 --> 11:49.910
As I told the police,

11:49.960 --> 11:53.790
I was at home listening to
records and wrapping presents.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.720
- I went to bed early.
- Oh, yes, home.

11:58.040 --> 11:59.990
Home...

12:00.040 --> 12:02.830
That little bedsitter of yours in town.

12:02.880 --> 12:05.070
Why did you give that up?

12:05.120 --> 12:06.120
Why did you...

12:08.760 --> 12:11.710
.. come back? Hm?

12:11.760 --> 12:14.550
I wanted to be close to my family,

12:14.600 --> 12:15.600
obviously.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.000
And what happened to you and Mickey?

12:20.240 --> 12:23.350
You used to be as thick as
thieves, you two and Jack.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.830
The Three Musketeers.

12:25.880 --> 12:29.200
Now you barely look at
each other. I wonder why.

12:31.840 --> 12:34.310
Our mother was murdered

12:34.360 --> 12:38.120
and Jack died in an act
of unspeakable savagery.

12:40.080 --> 12:41.790
It has an effect.

12:41.840 --> 12:42.920
Hm.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.310
You're like a little cat.

12:48.360 --> 12:49.680
Silent and secretive.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.600
Here pussy, pussy, pussy.

12:55.840 --> 12:58.360
Keep going, I like it. Ah-ha-ha.

13:03.280 --> 13:05.990
Something gnawing away at you, Christina?

13:06.040 --> 13:08.790
Why don't you just unburden your soul.

13:08.840 --> 13:09.840
Confess.

13:11.480 --> 13:12.480
Confess.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.230
Can I get a lift?

14:02.280 --> 14:04.240
Yes.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.030
No...

14:09.080 --> 14:12.320
No, let me off. Let me off.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.350
Let me off!

14:15.400 --> 14:16.830
Let me off!

14:16.880 --> 14:19.080
Let me off! Let me off.

14:42.560 --> 14:44.560
No, no...

14:59.880 --> 15:02.840
Hello. Oh, here she is.
Morning, Miss Argyll.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.200
Why are you so rude? You
never say hello back.

15:08.840 --> 15:10.990
Jack saw us.

15:11.040 --> 15:14.400
You're our favourite. We
just want to be friends.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.510
Fuck off!

15:21.560 --> 15:24.030
Fuck off! And leave me alone.

15:24.080 --> 15:25.480
Go on, that's it!

15:33.360 --> 15:34.160
Hmph!

15:53.840 --> 15:56.830
What on earth possessed you, Christina?

15:56.880 --> 16:00.630
My daughter screaming profanities
in public and hurling her shoes at

16:00.680 --> 16:02.710
children, completely unprovoked.

16:02.760 --> 16:05.390
They're not children.
It wasn't unprovoked.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.950
It's every day, every day.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.910
You are an Argyll.

16:08.960 --> 16:13.190
Before anything. First
and foremost, an Argyll.

16:13.240 --> 16:17.190
Your mother taught you to behave
with dignity and restraint.

16:17.240 --> 16:19.870
She taught you standards.

16:19.920 --> 16:21.760
So, remember them.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.280
Telling off, over.

16:37.520 --> 16:40.800
I need my best girl to be at her best.

16:42.840 --> 16:46.560
I'm quite nervous about this
wedding day tomorrow, you know?

17:02.920 --> 17:05.599
Run wild, make all the noise you want.

17:09.480 --> 17:12.359
- Come on, Mary.
- Come on, Mary.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.920
Wait for us.

17:33.880 --> 17:36.200
Make room for each other, now hold hands.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.390
Really tight. Ready?

17:39.440 --> 17:41.510
One, two, three...

17:44.960 --> 17:47.170
Yell, Mary. Scream!

18:22.320 --> 18:24.270
Sunny Point.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.670
You want me to go to the police?

18:25.720 --> 18:27.990
I beg your pardon, who is this?

18:28.040 --> 18:30.950
It's Calgary. I'm going to the police.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.990
I have telephoned them and told them
I'm coming in to make a statement.

18:34.040 --> 18:36.270
Then you'll believe I'm telling the truth.

18:36.320 --> 18:38.710
Jack was innocent.

18:38.760 --> 18:40.960
And your wife's killer is still free.

18:53.080 --> 18:56.280
So what, let him. Let the
police deal with him.

19:00.320 --> 19:01.320
Yes?

19:04.240 --> 19:06.440
I've got some errands
to run before tomorrow.

19:07.960 --> 19:08.960
I won't be long.

19:29.360 --> 19:31.920
Chief Constable Gould.

19:33.680 --> 19:36.910
- Bellamy. - I'm going to
take charge of this, Leo.

19:36.960 --> 19:38.200
Nothing left to chance.

20:25.960 --> 20:27.120
Perfect match.

20:49.520 --> 20:53.070
Doctor Calgary, the
station rang me at home.

20:53.120 --> 20:54.800
Are you certain about this?

20:56.960 --> 21:01.110
I'm certain. Whoever was
investigating, accused the wrong man.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.190
Jack Argyll is dead
because of their mistake.

21:04.240 --> 21:06.760
I'll go ahead, set everything up for you.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.500
You could have given me a lift.

22:44.840 --> 22:47.110
All right, all right.

22:47.160 --> 22:48.400
No, no.

22:50.200 --> 22:53.550
- There's no water.
- I'll get some then. And...

22:53.600 --> 22:54.900
.. I wanted to say that...

22:57.120 --> 22:58.720
.. there is no disappointment.

23:00.280 --> 23:05.230
About, well, certain
consequences of your accident.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.710
That side of things isn't important to me.

23:07.760 --> 23:09.920
And I love you very much.

23:12.120 --> 23:13.120
Your breath smells.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.430
It's all those pills you're taking.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.080
They dry you out. You're dried-up.

23:20.840 --> 23:22.320
Why are you so cruel to me?

23:23.480 --> 23:25.910
It's like kicking a whipped dog.

23:25.960 --> 23:27.790
It's easy.

23:27.840 --> 23:31.430
And the dog expects it, which you
are, Mary, you're a whipped dog.

23:31.480 --> 23:33.080
Licking the hand that beats you.

23:38.640 --> 23:39.640
I'll get your water.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.040
You have to be nicer to Mary.

24:12.720 --> 24:14.670
You'll get on better with Daddy.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.990
That's what it's always about, isn't it?

24:17.040 --> 24:18.470
Keeping Daddy happy.

24:18.520 --> 24:19.720
Just please, Philip.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.120
All right.

24:23.560 --> 24:24.560
For you.

24:26.520 --> 24:28.230
Good.

24:28.280 --> 24:29.400
Uh!

24:52.440 --> 24:56.160
Well, there have got to be some
perks to being in this bloody family.

25:28.960 --> 25:31.790
You keep coming back, Doctor Calgary.

25:31.840 --> 25:33.240
I have to do the right thing.

25:34.720 --> 25:36.320
And I am telling the truth, but...

25:38.080 --> 25:40.150
.. I have been lying.

25:40.200 --> 25:42.750
On the 24th of December 1954,

25:42.800 --> 25:47.190
I was admitted to a psychiatric
institution against my will.

25:47.240 --> 25:52.030
I got out. I stole a coat and
I stole a car and I absconded.

25:52.080 --> 25:53.710
I met your brother on the road.

25:53.760 --> 25:56.870
I drove him to the town.

25:56.920 --> 25:58.020
And then I was caught.

25:59.200 --> 26:02.030
Of course, I was caught. I don't
know why I thought I could get away.

26:02.080 --> 26:05.590
I wasn't myself, I was quite distressed.

26:05.640 --> 26:07.910
And that's where I've been,
for a year and a half.

26:07.960 --> 26:11.000
Not in a research station, not working.

26:12.680 --> 26:13.780
I've been in an asylum.

26:15.520 --> 26:16.840
I was released yesterday.

26:19.680 --> 26:21.600
What were you wearing when you met Jack?

26:23.320 --> 26:25.640
Hospital-issued pyjamas, they had stripes.

26:27.960 --> 26:30.950
Miss Argyll, I have to speak
to your father urgently.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.360
It's so important.

26:48.120 --> 26:50.390
You all thought he was a con man.

26:50.440 --> 26:51.960
I kept saying it, didn't I?

26:53.280 --> 26:56.190
What if Jack was telling the truth?

26:56.240 --> 26:57.840
What if there really was an alibi?

26:58.840 --> 27:01.040
Well, here he is.

27:02.320 --> 27:03.320
So, what now?

28:20.880 --> 28:23.270
Well, why would someone
want to run you over?

28:23.320 --> 28:25.550
- I don't know.
- What did he look like?

28:25.600 --> 28:28.670
I don't know. I didn't see
his face, not completely.

28:28.720 --> 28:31.470
I mean, I did, but that
was when he was dead.

28:31.520 --> 28:36.960
Doctor Calgary, Arthur,
this all sounds rather

28:37.120 --> 28:41.550
- fantastical. - He had a signet
ring, on his little finger.

28:41.600 --> 28:43.520
The crest was in the shape of a crown.

28:45.560 --> 28:47.880
- You know him?
- I think so.

28:50.080 --> 28:51.790
Bellamy Gould, our friend.

28:51.840 --> 28:53.590
Well, I have to tell someone, his wife.

28:53.640 --> 28:56.710
- Mr Argyll, think just a moment.
- We can't just leave him lying there.

28:56.760 --> 28:59.510
- That's barbaric. - I told the police
I was coming in to make a statement

28:59.560 --> 29:01.790
and the next thing, your
friend is driving his car at me.

29:01.840 --> 29:04.230
I was being shut up, got rid of.

29:04.280 --> 29:07.230
You can't trust the police, they're...
they're covering for someone.

29:07.280 --> 29:09.030
We've lived here for 25 years.

29:09.080 --> 29:12.790
You're talking about people who
came to Rachel's funeral and wept.

29:12.840 --> 29:16.390
I don't want my family to
know about this, not yet.

29:16.440 --> 29:17.440
Michael is...

29:19.560 --> 29:20.630
He has a short fuse.

29:20.680 --> 29:23.580
He'll want to retaliate, I don't
want another child in prison.

29:24.560 --> 29:26.950
Poole will know what to do with all this.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.950
My solicitor, I trust him.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.150
And as for Bellamy...

29:31.200 --> 29:32.800
.. who I thought was my friend...

29:33.800 --> 29:35.110
He arrested Jack.

29:35.160 --> 29:38.520
He charged Jack. He said...

29:41.920 --> 29:42.920
.. Jack had done it.

29:59.080 --> 30:01.600
I gave my clothes to a tramp.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.790
A gentleman of the road.

30:04.840 --> 30:07.320
Anyway, desperate for a slash.

30:18.680 --> 30:19.600
Hester.

30:35.480 --> 30:37.880
Now, what do you see in your husband?

30:39.520 --> 30:42.350
I mean, really, he's
just a jumped up copper.

30:42.400 --> 30:46.150
He's the Chief Constable,
a very important man.

30:46.200 --> 30:48.630
Aren't you so bored you could scream?

30:48.680 --> 30:51.230
He says you should have gone
to Korea with your brother.

30:51.280 --> 30:54.310
He says a good war would sort you out.

30:54.360 --> 30:58.390
And do you think I need
sorting out, Lydia?

30:58.440 --> 31:01.390
Don't call me Lydia. It's bad manners.

31:01.440 --> 31:03.750
And move. I need to get to the bathroom.

31:03.800 --> 31:04.800
Step over me...

31:05.800 --> 31:07.520
.. Mrs Gould.

31:24.760 --> 31:26.160
Nasty boy.

31:37.160 --> 31:38.860
Spelling mistakes. Do them again.

31:42.880 --> 31:44.320
Morning, Mr Argyll.

31:47.720 --> 31:48.720
Where's Jack?

31:50.560 --> 31:52.000
What's this about, Bellamy?

31:54.000 --> 31:56.110
He's been stealing from us.

31:56.160 --> 31:57.670
Not true, I'm afraid.

31:57.720 --> 32:00.110
The fragrant Lydia practically
forced the money on me.

32:00.160 --> 32:01.880
Well, why would she give you money?

32:03.240 --> 32:05.140
Because I've been fucking her, Mother.

32:06.920 --> 32:08.590
It was only supposed to be the once...

32:08.640 --> 32:11.920
- Stop it!.. - but she's a thirsty old
horse, isn't she? - You little shit!

32:16.640 --> 32:18.390
- Jack...
- That's more like it, isn't it?

32:18.440 --> 32:20.520
Bit too old for you, though, aren't I?

32:23.960 --> 32:25.600
Pervert.

32:27.880 --> 32:29.240
Bellamy, I am so...

32:34.800 --> 32:37.150
The Goulds are friends of ours!

32:37.200 --> 32:40.080
- Bellamy has helped me so much
with the trust. - Yes, I'm sure.

32:41.360 --> 32:44.240
He's very keen on orphans
and neglected children.

32:45.600 --> 32:46.900
Always happy to help them.

32:49.720 --> 32:52.390
You try so hard to appal me.

32:52.440 --> 32:54.480
You're such a gutless fraud, Mother.

32:56.080 --> 32:58.190
Smiling like there's nothing wrong.

32:58.240 --> 33:01.190
But you built a nuclear bunker in
the cellar in case the bombs start

33:01.240 --> 33:04.470
falling, so I know you're
terrified, I know you're a mess.

33:04.520 --> 33:06.430
Just admit it.

33:06.480 --> 33:08.630
Stop smiling. Stop pretending.

33:08.680 --> 33:10.960
And, in return, I'll stop.

33:13.480 --> 33:15.000
You won't break me, Jack.

33:22.840 --> 33:27.190
One word against me and I am warning
you, I don't care if we are friends,

33:27.240 --> 33:31.110
Leo, I shall have his head kicked in half.

33:31.160 --> 33:34.680
Every bone in his body broken.

33:54.440 --> 33:57.270
I'm not going to say anything about
your offer to help me blackmail

33:57.320 --> 34:00.080
this family. I don't
want to upset your wife.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.600
Do you really not know what you've done?

34:04.920 --> 34:06.910
The bomb you've just dropped?

34:06.960 --> 34:10.320
If Jack's innocent,
then one of them isn't.

34:12.280 --> 34:13.989
Dinner's served.

34:14.040 --> 34:15.989
The family are waiting for you.

34:16.040 --> 34:17.270
The old back's playing up.

34:17.320 --> 34:19.320
I think I'm just going to take myself off.

34:20.320 --> 34:22.350
Shall I fetch Mary for you?

34:22.400 --> 34:23.400
I'll be fine.

34:42.920 --> 34:44.000
I realise that my...

34:45.520 --> 34:46.520
.. my history of...

34:47.800 --> 34:51.310
.. being unwell makes me
an unreliable witness.

34:51.360 --> 34:54.469
But the hospital can back up what I say.

34:54.520 --> 34:57.720
The time and manner of my
absconding and the time of my...

34:59.120 --> 35:01.110
.. well, my capture.

35:01.160 --> 35:02.950
And you're quite well now?

35:03.000 --> 35:05.110
Not fantasising or seeing things?

35:05.160 --> 35:08.470
- Gwenda. - Well, really, he
said he'd been to the Arctic.

35:08.520 --> 35:10.630
I really was meant to be going there.

35:10.680 --> 35:12.800
I was part of a research team.

35:14.200 --> 35:19.360
- But, obviously, I...
- The question is, if Jack didn't kill Mother...

35:20.720 --> 35:21.840
.. then who did?

35:23.320 --> 35:24.920
There was someone else here.

35:26.920 --> 35:30.350
- Someone else?
- There was a car parked on the road.

35:30.400 --> 35:31.950
I had to swerve to avoid it.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
What sort of car?

35:34.080 --> 35:35.380
I only saw it for a second.

35:37.560 --> 35:39.120
Small. Brown.

35:41.120 --> 35:43.270
If the owner of that car could be found,

35:43.320 --> 35:46.270
you'd have the person that
did this to your family.

35:46.320 --> 35:49.030
Or at the very least
knows something about it.

35:49.080 --> 35:50.510
A brown car?

35:50.560 --> 35:52.470
There's no shortage of them about.

35:52.520 --> 35:53.520
It's a start.

35:55.760 --> 35:59.750
The fact that I'm too late
for Jack is unbearable.

35:59.800 --> 36:01.480
But I can clear his name.

36:02.600 --> 36:05.430
I can do that much. Just...

36:05.480 --> 36:08.080
.. one good, true thing.

36:09.200 --> 36:12.750
Well, my solicitor will be here
first thing in the morning.

36:12.800 --> 36:15.840
And then we can begin
clearing Jack's name.

36:19.600 --> 36:22.110
I think you're a very honourable man.

36:22.160 --> 36:24.400
No. I'm not.

36:26.360 --> 36:28.560
I'm really not.

36:47.160 --> 36:50.240
What are you so scared of, Arthur?

36:56.960 --> 36:59.590
The end of the world.

36:59.640 --> 37:03.470
All those people... blown to nothing.

37:03.520 --> 37:04.960
Boom!

37:06.720 --> 37:08.470
(All those people...)

37:10.320 --> 37:13.780
What have I done? What have I done?

37:18.680 --> 37:21.030
I'm dammed.

37:21.080 --> 37:22.200
I'm dammed.

37:24.400 --> 37:26.080
No!

37:43.400 --> 37:46.040
No! No!

37:48.400 --> 37:50.470
He only went to bed because
you were rude to him.

37:50.520 --> 37:53.320
People like that shouldn't
be allowed to just roam about.

37:55.720 --> 37:56.720
Where are you going?

37:59.920 --> 38:03.320
A bride never spends the night
before her wedding in with her groom.

38:04.440 --> 38:06.830
And I wasn't even in
the house that evening.

38:08.640 --> 38:10.390
So...

38:10.440 --> 38:14.070
.. I don't see why I should be
subjected to an interrogation,

38:14.120 --> 38:15.760
if it's all the same to you, Mary.

38:18.600 --> 38:19.880
Leo.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.550
You told us you got rid of that car

38:35.600 --> 38:39.600
because Mother had given it to you
and the memories hurt too much.

38:40.640 --> 38:43.880
- They did. - Well, why are you
worried they might be recognised?

38:45.960 --> 38:48.470
Because, in the dark and fog,

38:48.520 --> 38:52.720
a red car might easily
be mistaken for brown.

38:53.760 --> 38:55.470
Mickey, don't.

38:55.520 --> 38:59.110
Say please for once in your life.

38:59.160 --> 39:00.310
Say it!

39:00.360 --> 39:01.960
Daddy is blind to you.

39:03.600 --> 39:06.870
And you. Always has been.

39:06.920 --> 39:08.200
But I am not.

39:11.560 --> 39:13.830
I'll see you in the usual place...

39:13.880 --> 39:15.320
.. where we won't be heard.

39:42.280 --> 39:45.110
You'd better start thinking
about what you're going to say.

39:45.160 --> 39:46.480
What are you going to say?

39:48.920 --> 39:50.910
Fuck it.

39:50.960 --> 39:54.230
- I might just go spill my guts,
tell it all. - You wouldn't.

39:54.280 --> 39:55.880
It'd be better than this.

40:10.120 --> 40:11.120
Because this...

40:13.440 --> 40:15.200
.. this ain't living.

40:16.280 --> 40:18.080
No-one can call this a life.

40:48.440 --> 40:51.070
Solicitors tomorrow?

40:51.120 --> 40:52.150
- Really?
- I have to.

40:52.200 --> 40:55.270
No. The only thing you have to
do tomorrow is put on a suit,

40:55.320 --> 40:59.240
come to church, say your vows,
and put a ring on this finger.

41:00.440 --> 41:02.550
- I don't see how I can...
- Find a way, Leo.

41:02.600 --> 41:05.510
I don't care what way, just find it is.

41:05.560 --> 41:08.000
Church. Tomorrow.

41:09.400 --> 41:10.400
Noon.

41:15.160 --> 41:16.600
And I'll make it all better.

41:18.320 --> 41:19.640
As I always do.

41:53.400 --> 41:56.760
(Stop breathing down my neck.)

41:58.120 --> 41:59.240
(Bitch.)

42:07.400 --> 42:11.110
I'll get you ready for bed and
then I have something to do.

42:11.160 --> 42:12.160
I'm staying up.

42:13.360 --> 42:14.360
Why?

42:16.640 --> 42:17.940
What have you got that for?

42:26.880 --> 42:30.400
The only person in this family
who couldn't have killed her...

42:31.760 --> 42:36.270
.. was me. Because I was upstairs in bed.

42:36.320 --> 42:37.600
With a broken spine.

42:38.960 --> 42:40.120
Where were you?

42:41.760 --> 42:43.830
Well...

42:43.880 --> 42:45.720
.. this is a new experience, isn't it?

42:47.880 --> 42:49.560
You being afraid.

42:52.680 --> 42:56.240
Am I still the whipped dog,
licking the hand that beats me?

42:57.680 --> 42:58.870
Hm?

42:58.920 --> 43:01.630
I like you nervous, Philip.

43:01.680 --> 43:02.680
It suits you.

43:21.880 --> 43:23.800
Well, then, spit it out.

43:26.680 --> 43:30.150
I wanted to speak to Mother about
changing my job at the library.

43:30.200 --> 43:31.990
I parked on the road to think.

43:32.040 --> 43:33.830
I got out to get some fresh air.

43:33.880 --> 43:35.670
I didn't see any car go past.

43:35.720 --> 43:40.470
I didn't see Mother. I changed
my mind, and went home.

43:40.520 --> 43:42.830
If you're going to make something
up, try and make it good.

43:42.880 --> 43:45.030
It's what happened. I was with her.

43:45.080 --> 43:47.430
Of course you were. Lurking in the dark.

43:47.480 --> 43:48.480
Why were you there?

43:49.600 --> 43:51.390
Backup. You know what Mother was like.

43:51.440 --> 43:53.710
I'd been telling her for
ages she should leave,

43:53.760 --> 43:56.190
- she is treated like the tea girl.
- She is the tea girl!

43:56.240 --> 43:58.510
All lah-di-dah and full of herself

43:58.560 --> 44:00.270
but we remember when you arrived,

44:00.320 --> 44:03.270
crawling with fleas,
wetting the bed every night.

44:03.320 --> 44:05.070
- What's that got to do with it?
- Everything!

44:05.120 --> 44:07.430
- Why did you lie?
- Because she's devious!

44:07.480 --> 44:09.710
And he... he's a freak.

44:09.760 --> 44:12.910
Having to eat your dinner with a
spoon because you can't be trusted

44:12.960 --> 44:17.640
with anything sharp. Gouging holes
out of your arms and your legs.

44:18.680 --> 44:20.710
- We all know you do it.
- Shut up!

44:20.760 --> 44:22.670
You're no better than us, Mary.

44:22.720 --> 44:25.710
- You're no different.
- I am different, I am better, I was first,

44:25.760 --> 44:28.190
I was chosen! The rest of you have just...

44:28.240 --> 44:32.040
- .. - just turned up. - Tina, why
didn't you just say that you were there?

44:34.000 --> 44:37.360
I didn't want anyone thinking
Mother was difficult to talk to.

44:38.680 --> 44:40.590
I...

44:40.640 --> 44:42.910
We didn't want anyone
thinking that about her.

44:42.960 --> 44:46.230
You sound like you've been
practising that in the mirror.

44:46.280 --> 44:48.230
Well...

44:48.280 --> 44:50.990
Let's just see who's best girl now.

44:51.040 --> 44:54.590
I was so scared that I had done something,

44:54.640 --> 44:57.790
and every time I said that to you,
you couldn't tell me that I hadn't?

44:57.840 --> 45:02.230
You're no better than them.
What you did, what you are.

45:02.280 --> 45:04.670
Throwing yourself at men.

45:04.720 --> 45:06.150
So cheap.

45:06.200 --> 45:07.950
Damaged goods.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
Shop soiled.

45:10.320 --> 45:12.750
It's no wonder Daddy's ashamed of you.

45:12.800 --> 45:16.750
It wasn't us! It wasn't, and it
wasn't you, Hester. You were so ill!

45:16.800 --> 45:19.590
We thought you were going to die,
too, how could you have done anything?

45:19.640 --> 45:21.430
Ahh!

45:21.480 --> 45:24.230
None of you should have been here!

45:24.280 --> 45:27.030
It should have just been me!

45:27.080 --> 45:29.800
On my own with her, it
should have just been me!

45:31.640 --> 45:33.880
You ruined it.

45:37.240 --> 45:40.800
You ruined it, you all ruined it!

45:44.600 --> 45:46.480
Mary...

45:51.400 --> 45:52.400
.. was it you?

46:30.880 --> 46:32.240
Police?

46:34.320 --> 46:36.990
Hello? Hello!

46:37.040 --> 46:38.040
Philip.

46:39.880 --> 46:41.440
Put the telephone down.

46:43.920 --> 46:46.710
Don't call the police, Philip.

46:46.760 --> 46:48.880
We'll talk when you're sober.

47:37.240 --> 47:40.030
- Lieutenant Durrant.
- Calgary, get in here.

47:40.080 --> 47:41.080
Get in here!

47:43.880 --> 47:44.880
Is everything OK?

47:45.920 --> 47:46.920
Come here.

47:48.640 --> 47:49.640
They're all in on it.

47:51.080 --> 47:52.590
All of them.

47:52.640 --> 47:54.310
Every bloody one of them.

47:54.360 --> 47:58.270
- How do you mean?
- I tried to call the police and Leo...

47:58.320 --> 48:01.630
.. Leo wouldn't let me and then he
came and took the phone away from me.

48:01.680 --> 48:04.190
There's a good reason for
not wanting the police.

48:04.240 --> 48:07.200
Listen to me! This house
is a bloody death trap.

48:08.400 --> 48:10.590
And you need to get me...

48:10.640 --> 48:11.750
.. out of here.

48:11.800 --> 48:16.120
They know that I know, and
they'll come for me, and you.

48:19.760 --> 48:22.150
Lieutenant Durrant...

48:22.200 --> 48:26.230
.. when you wanted to use Mrs Argyll's
murder as a means of extortion,

48:26.280 --> 48:28.590
you were drunk, and you're drunk now.

48:28.640 --> 48:29.640
Very drunk.

48:30.800 --> 48:32.720
I think you need some rest.

48:36.040 --> 48:37.720
Oh, Christ.

48:40.200 --> 48:41.280
Get away from me!

48:43.320 --> 48:46.280
Dis... missed. BUGGER OFF!

51:25.480 --> 51:26.880
Oh, God.

51:32.040 --> 51:33.520
Of course it's you.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.160
Morning.

51:50.120 --> 51:52.150
It wasn't only the police I told.

51:52.200 --> 51:53.900
I was coming in to make a statement.

51:55.440 --> 51:56.760
I also told you.

51:58.840 --> 52:01.080
You're the one who wants to shut me up.

52:03.280 --> 52:04.280
It's you.

52:17.080 --> 52:20.750
Off you go. Take my car.
Drive to the nearest city.

52:20.800 --> 52:23.150
Talk to the police there.
Tell them who you are.

52:23.200 --> 52:27.470
No-one here is holding you
prisoner, least of all me.

52:27.520 --> 52:29.270
Door's open, keys are right there.

52:29.320 --> 52:30.320
Pick them up and go.

52:33.160 --> 52:36.310
Not everyone would have taken a
psychiatric patient into their home,

52:36.360 --> 52:42.440
Arthur. I presume they gave you pills
or something to keep you reasonable.

52:43.960 --> 52:45.840
Do me the courtesy of taking them.

52:48.120 --> 52:50.240
I don't... have them any more.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.040
They make me numb.

53:10.760 --> 53:12.520
They... make me...

53:14.320 --> 53:18.600
.. not mind. I don't deserve
to not mind what I've done...

53:19.800 --> 53:21.800
What could you possibly have done?

53:23.600 --> 53:24.880
My work...

53:25.960 --> 53:27.360
I didn't know.

53:35.480 --> 53:37.270
Didn't know what?

53:37.320 --> 53:40.640
You're a physicist, what
was it you were working on?

53:44.040 --> 53:45.200
I wrote a formula.

53:47.640 --> 53:49.550
Part of a formula...

53:49.600 --> 53:53.870
.. for detonation.

53:53.920 --> 53:55.440
Fat Man and Little Boy.

53:56.480 --> 53:58.360
For the bomb.

53:59.480 --> 54:00.480
I'm damned.

54:02.160 --> 54:06.720
So... clearing Jack's
name, it's atonement.

54:09.560 --> 54:10.800
One...

54:12.200 --> 54:13.640
.. good, true thing.

54:14.760 --> 54:16.430
Just one.

54:16.480 --> 54:17.550
Just one.

54:17.600 --> 54:19.520
And you can have it.

54:21.760 --> 54:25.790
The door's open, you don't
need to be here to be...

54:25.840 --> 54:26.840
.. redeemed.

54:51.280 --> 54:53.080
I'm so sorry. I'm...

54:54.160 --> 54:56.430
.. sorry. I'm...

54:56.480 --> 54:58.520
Come on. Least said...

54:59.880 --> 55:00.880
.. soonest mended.

55:05.080 --> 55:07.880
- Will you need anything else?
- Not at the moment, thank you.

55:36.640 --> 55:37.640
Well?

55:39.120 --> 55:40.360
You promised.

55:59.080 --> 56:00.910
May I...

56:00.960 --> 56:02.480
- .. - ask a question? - Of course.

56:04.080 --> 56:06.160
Why are you so convinced it was Jack?

56:10.520 --> 56:13.070
He was an extreme young man.

56:13.120 --> 56:15.590
The evidence against him seemed...

56:15.640 --> 56:19.520
.. conclusive. Everything
against him seemed conclusive.

56:23.400 --> 56:25.190
Where is Mrs Durrant?

56:25.240 --> 56:27.870
Still asleep. It was a
late night for everyone.

56:27.920 --> 56:29.150
I didn't hear them come in.

56:29.200 --> 56:33.190
She sometimes spends the night
in her old bedroom upstairs.

56:33.240 --> 56:37.160
- Why? - The shower has been
running quite a while, I think.

56:38.200 --> 56:39.560
Perhaps he's fallen.

56:51.960 --> 56:53.800
Philip!

56:55.320 --> 56:58.870
- Is it locked?
- No, in case he needs help.

56:58.920 --> 57:00.000
Philip?

57:02.160 --> 57:03.160
We're coming in.

57:29.200 --> 57:30.710
Is all of this happening because of me?

57:30.760 --> 57:32.680
All this happened a long time ago.

57:43.520 --> 57:44.760
Tell me it isn't true.

57:47.160 --> 57:48.320
How did you bear it?

57:56.040 --> 57:59.240
I suppose it was inevitable.
They're at each other.

58:01.760 --> 58:03.880
He can't reach the morphine on his own.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.520
No, no!
