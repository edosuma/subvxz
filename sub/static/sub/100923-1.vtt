02:48.027 --> 02:48.959
Hey.

02:48.961 --> 02:52.696
Hi. I didn't hear your car.

02:52.698 --> 02:57.467
I left it at office and got a ride, so if
you can drive me tomorrow, that'd be great.

02:57.469 --> 02:59.103
- Yeah, of course.
- Thank you.

02:59.105 --> 03:02.372
What are you watching?
What is going on here?

03:02.374 --> 03:03.542
Some musician.

03:04.143 --> 03:05.876
I didn't know that you sang.

03:05.878 --> 03:06.944
What are talking about?

03:06.946 --> 03:09.381
I've never heard you sing.
You've got a good voice.

03:10.415 --> 03:12.515
I was in an <i>a capella</i>
group in college.

03:12.517 --> 03:16.586
You were in an <i>a capella</i>
group in college?

03:16.588 --> 03:17.688
Onomatopoeia.

03:17.690 --> 03:18.791
Why didn't I know this?

03:19.959 --> 03:20.958
You never asked.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.427
Well, you never sing.

03:24.730 --> 03:26.098
Let's see.

03:28.400 --> 03:31.135
Goh. Goh Nakamoo-ra?

03:31.137 --> 03:32.772
It's Nakamura.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.774
So, I'm making chia seed pudding for
breakfast tomorrow morning if you want any.

03:36.776 --> 03:38.642
Mm-hmm.

03:38.644 --> 03:39.710
Did you eat?

03:39.712 --> 03:41.346
Yeah, they ordered pizza.

03:41.848 --> 03:43.950
By the way, I'm gonna be a
little bit late tomorrow night.

03:44.951 --> 03:46.784
- He's pretty good.
- Yeah.

03:46.786 --> 03:47.918
Go Goh!

03:47.920 --> 03:50.120
Yeah, he seems talented.

03:50.122 --> 03:51.155
How'd you find this guy?

03:51.157 --> 03:53.558
Um, I just stumbled on him.

04:27.059 --> 04:28.694
Wait right there for me.

04:33.199 --> 04:35.533
Let's take off mommy's shirt
and put this on.

04:37.970 --> 04:39.839
Don't you want to wear
your own clothes?

04:48.480 --> 04:50.850
<i>Starting route to Jacob
Funeral Home.</i>

05:00.693 --> 05:02.161
Here. Take it.

05:14.073 --> 05:16.140
<i>Hey, it's Goh. Leave
me a message.</i>

05:16.142 --> 05:19.178
Goh, you're late! Where are you?

05:33.125 --> 05:38.561
Okay. So, this is the urn that
I was telling you about earlier.

05:38.563 --> 05:39.231
Okay.

05:42.868 --> 05:45.570
It comes in several different
finishes and sizes.

05:48.841 --> 05:50.274
We don't allow food in here.

05:50.276 --> 05:53.679
Oh, sorry. I didn't know.

05:54.947 --> 05:55.815
Thank you.

05:57.783 --> 05:59.151
Come on, come here.

06:17.436 --> 06:20.337
Yeah, I don't know. Do
I have to decide now?

06:20.339 --> 06:26.078
Uh, no, but... where's
your daughter?

06:27.279 --> 06:28.147
Oh no.

06:30.349 --> 06:31.616
Sachiko?

06:32.251 --> 06:33.919
Sachiko?

06:44.930 --> 06:48.634
I already made the arrangements.
The service is on Sunday.

06:49.135 --> 06:50.102
I'm so sorry.

06:52.338 --> 06:55.041
She threw up. That's why she's
wearing my shirt.

06:59.211 --> 07:00.946
Did you sleep on your flight?

07:01.814 --> 07:07.552
I did. Um, then I fell
immediately asleep at the hotel,

07:08.054 --> 07:09.789
around like 8 last night?

07:10.990 --> 07:12.792
Well, that's very nice.

07:19.065 --> 07:20.197
It's back.

07:20.199 --> 07:21.732
Huh?

07:21.734 --> 07:25.903
Oh, you know that I was gonna take care
of the music for the service, right?

07:25.905 --> 07:28.038
I thought you meant that you
would just make a playlist.

07:28.040 --> 07:31.077
Yea-Ming's been holding onto
the guitar since we moved.

07:32.344 --> 07:33.345
I didn't see her.

07:34.346 --> 07:36.882
She was out for
a job interview or something,

07:38.217 --> 07:39.817
but I saw her roommate, Jasmine.

07:39.819 --> 07:42.653
Actually, she's playing a
last-minute show tonight?

07:42.655 --> 07:44.723
You know, I thought maybe I
could take Sachiko?

07:45.991 --> 07:47.126
You don't wanna come, do you?

07:47.927 --> 07:49.361
I'm exhausted.

07:50.863 --> 07:55.868
I haven't slept in days, and I've been
by myself with Sachiko all morning.

07:56.335 --> 07:57.503
I'm sorry.

07:59.004 --> 08:01.939
What are you up to now? Are you
gonna see your cousin Janet?

08:01.941 --> 08:02.808
Julia.

08:05.044 --> 08:08.745
Look, I'm... I'm trying really
hard to be supportive here.

08:08.747 --> 08:12.382
I thought you'd be happy to have more time
to yourself or with your family and...

08:12.384 --> 08:16.222
What in the world makes you think
any of this makes me happy, Goh?

08:18.390 --> 08:19.992
I'll get you the car seat.

08:27.133 --> 08:28.899
Ready to go to your first show?

Mm-hm. We met at Eboni's
baby shower, right?

09:15.781 --> 09:17.481
Um, maybe.

09:17.483 --> 09:19.850
I think it was at Kiara's
fifth birthday, right?

09:19.852 --> 09:21.919
Kiara's fifth birthday? Yeah.

09:21.921 --> 09:23.887
When did Kiara have a birthday?

09:23.889 --> 09:25.756
Uh, I think it was...

09:25.758 --> 09:28.025
- September 11th.
- Oh, September 11th, poor kid.

09:28.027 --> 09:30.227
Eboni's parents threw her
a huge picnic down in Compton.

09:30.229 --> 09:31.929
- Crenshaw.
- Crenshaw.

09:31.931 --> 09:34.965
Oh. I wasn't invited.

09:34.967 --> 09:38.068
Oh, well it was mostly family
and just friends from school, so.

09:38.070 --> 09:39.536
How do you know Eboni again?

09:39.538 --> 09:41.772
We were in a band together
in college.

09:41.774 --> 09:43.340
Oh, that's right.

09:43.342 --> 09:47.010
What? Eboni was in a band?
What did she play?

09:47.012 --> 09:48.111
Wasn't it guitar?

09:48.113 --> 09:50.113
No, bass. She also sang.

09:50.115 --> 09:53.183
Well, she absolutely loves you.
I mean, you come highly recommended.

09:53.185 --> 09:55.085
I'm sorry you couldn't meet
Alfie in person.

09:55.087 --> 09:57.187
He's staying at
his nana and pop-pop's tonight.

09:57.189 --> 10:00.224
But I'm sure you know the drill.
You probably babysit all the time.

10:00.226 --> 10:02.960
Yeah, I do. I mean, not
professionally, but...

10:02.962 --> 10:06.098
Oh, but Eboni says that you're
amazing with Kiara.

10:06.799 --> 10:07.998
I love that kid.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.935
There you go. You got
kids of your own?

10:10.502 --> 10:13.003
No. I don't.

10:13.005 --> 10:14.173
But you want them.

10:15.274 --> 10:17.209
I mean, I don't even have a
boyfriend right now, so.

10:18.344 --> 10:20.246
You guys got any single friends?

10:22.214 --> 10:23.280

10:23.282 --> 10:25.816
Uh, Venmo, or cash?

10:25.818 --> 10:27.851
Honey, we have Venmo, right?

10:27.853 --> 10:28.921

11:13.232 --> 11:14.800

11:15.501 --> 11:17.067

11:17.069 --> 11:18.404

11:19.238 --> 11:20.370

11:29.248 --> 11:30.480
Oh. I'm so sorry.

11:30.482 --> 11:35.052
Yeah, he died alone. I haven't
been the greatest daughter.

11:35.054 --> 11:36.055
I'm so sorry.

11:37.489 --> 11:42.627
Is it okay if I just wear this
dress for his funeral and return it?

11:42.629 --> 11:45.497
It's okay if I just keep
the tags on?

11:46.398 --> 11:49.268
Our return policy is for

11:53.906 --> 11:54.873

Hey, moustache, bring out my
phone when you're done!

13:19.158 --> 13:21.558
Idiot. All right.
So, where are we going?

13:21.560 --> 13:23.326
I don't know. What's
good around here?

13:23.328 --> 13:27.564
I am on an elimination diet, so I can't eat
soy, dairy, eggs, crustaceans, or tree nuts.

13:27.566 --> 13:29.535

find something.

Oh, Rachel.

13:32.371 --> 13:33.238
What?

13:33.773 --> 13:35.338
Why are you listening to this?

13:35.340 --> 13:36.573
It's good stuff.

13:36.575 --> 13:39.176
No, no, seriously, why are you
strolling down memory lane?

13:39.178 --> 13:40.212
That's not what I'm doing.

13:41.781 --> 13:44.116
- You're a horrible liar.
- That's not what I'm doing.

13:44.616 --> 13:45.750
Thinking about divorce?

13:45.752 --> 13:47.384
Oh my God, where are we going?

13:47.386 --> 13:49.121
Calm down, calm down. I'll find
something.

13:50.690 --> 13:54.627
So, I guess Josh is still getting
blow jobs from his assistant?

13:57.529 --> 13:59.231
You allowed to smoke
on this diet?

14:06.271 --> 14:09.473
So, have you checked his
text messages lately?

14:09.475 --> 14:12.677
No. My shrink told me I
shouldn't be doing that anymore.

14:12.679 --> 14:16.179
She's like 22. He's not gonna
leave me for her.

14:16.181 --> 14:20.085
Sorry I've been so M. I. A. Freakin'
YouTube channel's taken over my life.

14:20.753 --> 14:22.586
You're so lucky
your husband's rich.

14:22.588 --> 14:25.624
Ah, maybe with all your free
time you can rebrand my site?

14:28.661 --> 14:30.996
Should I text Goh, see if he
still has a crush on you?

14:31.664 --> 14:32.630
I don't care.

14:32.632 --> 14:34.665
- Yeah right!
- I don't care.

14:34.667 --> 14:36.703
Hey, dude, period.

14:37.603 --> 14:40.439
I'm drinking kale juice with
your prom date right now, period.

14:41.406 --> 14:44.407
Amy, don't send that! What
is wrong with you?

14:44.409 --> 14:48.445
Oh! Let's send him a selfie.
And let's use a fun filter.

14:48.447 --> 14:50.347
Why are you acting like a
teenage girl?

14:50.349 --> 14:53.818
I'm not ready to just casually reconnect
with him after all these years.

14:53.820 --> 14:57.655
He's probably just living in
Wisconsin, in Green Bay with...

14:57.657 --> 14:58.856
Madison, Madison.

14:58.858 --> 15:00.557
Eating cheese or whatever
they do there.

15:00.559 --> 15:02.494
Actually, they broke up.

15:04.229 --> 15:06.731
He's still living in their house,
but they're not together anymore.

15:06.733 --> 15:08.298
When did this happen?

15:08.300 --> 15:12.502
Couple months ago, when I was in Boulder
shooting those energy drink videos.

15:12.504 --> 15:14.337
I forgot to tell you.

15:14.339 --> 15:15.973
Yeah, you did.

15:15.975 --> 15:20.678
Last time I saw Goh, he was a zombie.
And he's still not playing music. So lame.

15:21.681 --> 15:23.446
Oh shit!

15:23.448 --> 15:24.316
What?

15:26.318 --> 15:29.219
- Who just texted you? Give me...
- No.

15:29.221 --> 15:31.323
- Amy, give me your phone.
- No.

15:33.760 --> 15:38.729
All right, this is the top one, and this is
the bottom one, and you turn to the left.

15:38.731 --> 15:41.199
Wait, is that right?
Hold on. Let me check.

15:41.701 --> 15:45.137
Yeah. You turn it to the
left, away from the door. Okay?

15:45.738 --> 15:46.605
Okay.

15:48.206 --> 15:52.045
I took in the mail and the newspapers,
and they're all on the dining room table.

15:54.379 --> 15:56.546
And I tried to air out
the place a bit.

15:56.548 --> 15:58.818
Actually, it smells a lot
better than it did before.

16:11.798 --> 16:13.496
Oh!

16:13.498 --> 16:16.867
Erika, I'm so sorry. I didn't wash the sheets.
Is that okay? Should I strip the bed?

16:16.869 --> 16:19.637
Oh, no, it's fine, thank you.

16:19.639 --> 16:23.573
Oh, and the funeral home said they
didn't find a wedding band on him.

16:23.575 --> 16:25.475
Do you know where he
might have kept it?

16:25.477 --> 16:26.578
No.

16:27.613 --> 16:29.247
Huh, he wasn't wearing one.

16:30.482 --> 16:32.551
Um, okay.

16:42.427 --> 16:45.730
Did you get my email about the
visiting professor job?

16:45.732 --> 16:47.297
Yes.

16:47.299 --> 16:50.369
Oh, good, because the department head
said they're really desperate to fill it.

16:50.903 --> 16:52.937
Hey, why don't you come to
campus with me,

16:52.939 --> 16:54.972
and I'll show you around,
introduce you to people?

16:54.974 --> 16:56.206
Oh, I don't know if can...

16:56.208 --> 16:58.343
Erika. You're applying.

16:58.778 --> 17:01.712
There's no way you're not. Okay?
It's only for two years.

17:01.714 --> 17:04.781
It's just our house is there
and everything's there.

17:04.784 --> 17:09.354
All right, then sell it, sublet it,
whatever. You own this place now.

17:11.490 --> 17:12.357
What about Goh?

17:13.425 --> 17:15.260
You really think he wants to go
back to Wisconsin?

17:15.828 --> 17:17.426
Erika, I'm sorry, I have to go.

17:17.429 --> 17:19.763
You want to do dinner? Does
Sachiko even do sushi?

17:19.766 --> 17:22.666
I think she's gonna
be with Goh, still.

17:22.669 --> 17:24.336
Okay, you have to eat.

17:26.005 --> 17:29.406
I think I'm just gonna take it easy tonight
and stay in, eat some of dad's ramen.

17:29.408 --> 17:30.710
Oh god, that's depressing.

17:31.844 --> 17:33.345
I am depressed.

17:38.383 --> 17:40.918
Erika. You need to change.

17:40.920 --> 17:42.254
You need to be here.

17:43.288 --> 17:44.222
I need you here.

17:50.763 --> 17:52.462
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

17:52.464 --> 17:54.834
But I'd better see your
application, all right?

17:58.270 --> 17:58.938
Bye.

20:22.982 --> 20:25.115
Hey. Can we get one
of those too?

20:25.117 --> 20:29.421
Goh Nakamura, holy
shit! Ooh. Sorry.

20:30.089 --> 20:31.822
This is Auntie Yea-Ming.

20:31.824 --> 20:33.558
Oh my God, that sounds so weird.

20:34.060 --> 20:35.592
This is Sachiko.

20:35.594 --> 20:37.661
- Hi, Sachiko!
- She's five.

20:37.663 --> 20:40.798
Oh, man. I guess it's been five
years, then, since I've seen you.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.565
Did you get your guitar
back from Jasmine?

20:42.567 --> 20:43.667
I did, yeah.

20:43.669 --> 20:45.836
Cool. She's a good one. I
played her all the time.

20:45.838 --> 20:46.737
She? Her? What?

20:46.739 --> 20:50.506
Yeah. I named her Goh-hana.
Goh-hana!

20:50.508 --> 20:51.476
Stupid!

20:53.212 --> 20:55.547
She actually misses
you all the time.

20:56.514 --> 20:58.918
Hey. Can we get one
of those shirts?

21:00.887 --> 21:02.820
Do you want an extra small?

21:02.822 --> 21:04.922
Something for a small child.

21:04.924 --> 21:06.826
All right, let me grab
that for ya.

21:08.194 --> 21:09.095
Let's see.

21:09.829 --> 21:11.128
What do you say, Sachiko?

21:11.130 --> 21:13.833
You like that? You want it?

21:15.467 --> 21:16.734
Let me fold this up for you.

21:16.736 --> 21:17.868
What do I owe you?

21:17.870 --> 21:18.969
It's totally fine. Here.

21:18.971 --> 21:21.471
- No, seriously, I...
- She's gonna be so cute in it!

21:21.473 --> 21:23.240
- Seriously.
- No. Please don't.

21:23.242 --> 21:26.977
- I gotta support your art and...
- No, you don't. Nope. Please.

21:26.979 --> 21:30.546
That's so dorky. Just take it.

21:30.548 --> 21:31.616
Sachiko.

21:32.584 --> 21:36.153
Hey. Come on. I gotta
take her to her mom.

21:36.155 --> 21:38.756
- Oh, how is "The Professor?"
- She's good.

21:38.758 --> 21:41.591
Yeah? I heard about her dad.

21:41.593 --> 21:45.029
I'm so sorry.
Are you staying with her?

21:45.031 --> 21:49.900
Uh, no. Erika and Sachiko are
actually at her father's place.

21:49.902 --> 21:51.070
Where are you staying?

21:51.804 --> 21:53.070
Usual spot.

21:53.072 --> 21:57.775
That motel? Ew, really? Gross.
You should stay with me, dude.

21:57.777 --> 22:00.811
- Really?
- Yeah. I mean, Jasmine's never around anyway.

22:00.813 --> 22:04.882
She's always at some guy's house
or some girl's house.

22:04.884 --> 22:09.286
She's got one of those bed in a box
mattresses. You know what I'm talking about?

22:09.288 --> 22:12.622
I'm always hearing about those
at the beginning of podcast ads.

22:12.624 --> 22:15.591
Yeah. Totally. They're
actually really comfy.

22:15.593 --> 22:20.297
I paid for the room already tonight, but maybe
they'll let me cancel the rest of the week.

22:20.299 --> 22:22.733
When are you going
back to Wisconsin?

22:22.735 --> 22:27.237
I'm not sure yet. Yeah, Erika still
has to sell her father's house, so...

22:27.239 --> 22:28.872
Okay.

22:28.874 --> 22:32.776
I figured I'd stick around a little bit
to help out with this little one here.

22:32.778 --> 22:34.144
Yeah.

22:34.146 --> 22:36.146
- You want to try this on, Sachiko? Isn't that pretty?
- Where?

22:36.148 --> 22:38.682
Let's go to the bathroom.
I think we have to go to the bathroom.

22:38.684 --> 22:40.550
- Mm-hm.
- Okay, let's go.

22:40.552 --> 22:42.152
Do you need me to take her?

22:42.154 --> 22:43.320
Nah, nah, I got this.

22:43.322 --> 22:45.590
Okay. Well, give me a hug.

22:46.759 --> 22:48.094
It's good to see you.

22:48.961 --> 22:50.094
- Okay.
- Thank you.

22:50.096 --> 22:54.633
- All right. Bye-bye. Say bye.
- Bye, Sachiko. Bye, Goh.

23:01.073 --> 23:02.041
Hey, Alexa?

23:02.908 --> 23:05.275
Play Goh Nakamura,
"If You Want Me To."

23:34.707 --> 23:37.174
<i>Hey Goh, period.</i>

23:37.176 --> 23:39.777
<i>Heard you're
coming back to LA, period.</i>

23:39.779 --> 23:45.117
If you have time, comma, I'd
love to see you, period.

27:06.051 --> 27:10.823
Testing out Jasmine's bed
for you,

27:12.091 --> 27:13.259
exclamation point.

27:51.397 --> 27:55.299
I am so sorry that
I missed your show.

27:55.301 --> 27:57.367
It's fine. No worries.

27:57.369 --> 28:01.104
No, it's... I'm a terrible friend.
But I have, you know, Harper.

28:01.106 --> 28:06.211
He's like, insisted that daddy read,
so it was like the next thing I know,

28:06.945 --> 28:12.215
it's 9:45, and I got another... I
really am sorry.

28:12.217 --> 28:13.185
It's fine.

28:15.954 --> 28:18.123
Whoa. Someone's trying
to get in.

28:19.925 --> 28:21.425
Oh, shit, it's Goh!

28:21.427 --> 28:22.559
The guitar guy?

28:22.561 --> 28:23.493
Yeah.

28:23.495 --> 28:26.530
No, you want to go that way.

28:26.532 --> 28:27.933
No, the other that way.

28:29.168 --> 28:31.601
You know what, I'm gonna go let
him in. Your hair's a mess.

28:31.603 --> 28:33.070
I don't care. Fuck.

28:33.072 --> 28:34.271
You look hung over.

28:34.273 --> 28:35.174
Shut up!

28:35.941 --> 28:36.674
Hey, man.

28:36.676 --> 28:39.345
Alex. Goh, come on in.

28:42.448 --> 28:47.250
Wow. You weren't exaggerating.
This place is like really nice.

28:47.252 --> 28:48.485
What are you doing here?

28:48.487 --> 28:49.555
I got your new song.

28:50.222 --> 28:51.490
You're finally writing again?

28:53.559 --> 28:55.094
I'm, you know, here to help.

28:55.662 --> 29:00.631
Um, okay. Um, I'm kind of
working right now.

29:00.633 --> 29:03.100
No, no, it's fine. I got this.

29:03.102 --> 29:05.636
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Go take a break.

29:05.638 --> 29:07.072
All right, thanks.

29:08.440 --> 29:09.408
You still teach?

29:10.242 --> 29:12.378
Um, not really.

29:13.212 --> 29:17.614
The kids these days, they kind of
like playing music and making music

29:17.616 --> 29:19.551
on their computers more than
anything, so.

29:20.252 --> 29:21.485
Do you miss teaching?

29:21.487 --> 29:24.020
Yeah, I do, I do. Yeah.

29:24.022 --> 29:25.958
Did you ever think you'd
be a full-time dad?

29:26.558 --> 29:27.692
I still have a job.

29:27.694 --> 29:30.728
Oh. What do you do?

29:30.730 --> 29:32.297
Customer service.

29:33.399 --> 29:34.866
I always
thought I'd have a family,

29:34.868 --> 29:39.538
but I also thought that I would still
be able to play music, you know?

29:41.340 --> 29:42.372
Like you.

29:42.374 --> 29:46.309
Oh my God. Do not compare
your life with mine.

29:46.311 --> 29:47.144
Why not?

29:47.146 --> 29:49.314
Cause you're like
a fucking adult.

29:50.048 --> 29:51.181
You're an adult.

29:51.183 --> 29:55.653
I mean, I've got this stupid
roommate, and she's young,

29:55.655 --> 29:59.322
and she makes more money than
me, and she goes to school.

29:59.324 --> 30:00.426
I don't know.

30:01.460 --> 30:03.362
You're doing what you
love though.

30:06.633 --> 30:08.198
Can I tell you a secret?

30:08.200 --> 30:09.366
Secret? Yeah.

30:09.368 --> 30:12.104
In Madison, I bought a
cheap guitar.

30:12.571 --> 30:15.405
Just keep it in the storeroom.

30:15.407 --> 30:18.475
And I play it on
breaks, you know.

30:18.477 --> 30:20.610
It's the only
time I play, you know.

30:20.612 --> 30:22.279
I've become that guy.

30:22.281 --> 30:25.515
This is a secret? Like you
never even told Erika?

30:25.517 --> 30:26.784
Oh, no, hell no.

30:26.786 --> 30:27.654
Fuck.

30:29.421 --> 30:31.290
Well, don't be that guy. Here.

30:32.191 --> 30:33.058
Help.

30:34.126 --> 30:39.630
So, since I texted
you, I wrote a couple verses.

30:39.632 --> 30:43.001
Um, so, play G.

30:43.736 --> 30:44.603
A.

30:45.672 --> 30:46.637
C.

30:46.639 --> 30:47.573
D.

30:48.440 --> 30:50.207
And then it's sort of like...

30:54.079 --> 30:54.747
Yeah.

30:56.381 --> 30:57.249
Cool.

30:59.218 --> 31:01.019
Don't make it jazzy.

31:02.221 --> 31:04.287
I don't want it to be jazzy.

31:04.289 --> 31:06.525
No seventh chords and all that.

31:07.292 --> 31:08.728
All that jazz.

31:09.662 --> 31:11.597
Let's just do regular chords.
Okay, yeah.

31:12.297 --> 31:14.233
Let's make it like move a
little.

31:15.702 --> 31:16.568
Yeah.

31:18.070 --> 31:18.738
Cool.

31:21.139 --> 31:23.342

32:05.551 --> 32:08.053
And then, for the chorus,
you're gonna go to C.

32:08.620 --> 32:10.353
- No way!
- Yeah.

32:10.355 --> 32:12.291
You gotta keep going with
the verses there.

32:12.792 --> 32:16.361
What? No, I... I could barely
write these, so...

32:16.763 --> 32:21.166
It's way too soon to go to a chorus then.
You don't even know what the song's about.

32:23.602 --> 32:26.336
- I don't really know what the song's about.
- It's about...

about not being able to let things go?

32:57.369 --> 32:58.871
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:02.742 --> 33:04.744
Is that a new bra?

33:05.510 --> 33:08.246
Uh, no, I've always had it.

33:08.781 --> 33:09.649
Hm.

33:10.683 --> 33:14.319
It's... good.

33:17.356 --> 33:18.355
It's really good.

33:18.357 --> 33:19.224
Thank you.

33:23.428 --> 33:24.296
I'm sorry.

33:25.965 --> 33:27.665
May I touch your boob?

33:27.667 --> 33:30.535
Yeah, sure, just don't
call them boobs.

33:32.537 --> 33:33.472
Okay.

33:36.241 --> 33:37.309
What should I call them?

33:38.711 --> 33:41.346
Well, we're not in junior high,
so I'm sure you can figure it out.

33:43.650 --> 33:44.784
Mammary glands?

33:46.551 --> 33:49.354
Okay, yeah, you smell like
garlic. Excuse me.

33:53.291 --> 33:54.159
Hey.

33:55.662 --> 33:56.528
Rach?

33:58.563 --> 34:02.267
What's, what's going on here?

34:03.435 --> 34:04.302
Nothing.

34:05.838 --> 34:08.473
- Do you want to talk about it?
- Nothing's going on.

34:11.878 --> 34:16.547
You... you look so beautiful.

34:16.983 --> 34:17.850
Thank you.

34:19.418 --> 34:20.452
I mean it.

34:21.453 --> 34:23.723
I am so lucky
to be married to you.

34:24.824 --> 34:25.824
I hear your words.

34:28.260 --> 34:29.960
I am madly in love with you.

34:29.962 --> 34:32.797
- I am as in love with you as...
- Okay, okay! Okay, Josh.

34:32.799 --> 34:37.835
I'm sorry, I just... I'm late meeting
Amy in Santa Monica for a movie,

34:37.837 --> 34:39.938
and traffic's already a
nightmare, so.

34:44.643 --> 34:45.510
Bye.

34:50.650 --> 34:52.317
What movie are you going to see?

34:53.284 --> 34:54.051
I don't know.

34:54.053 --> 34:55.820
Some experimental
thing, and...

34:55.822 --> 34:57.289
you know what, um...

34:58.825 --> 35:00.557
We're probably gonna go out
to eat after,

35:00.559 --> 35:02.494
and so I don't know what time
I'm gonna be home?

35:02.995 --> 35:04.731
Look, Rachel, I am sorry.

35:06.465 --> 35:07.898
Okay? I am sorry.

35:07.900 --> 35:11.035
I don't know how many times I'm
gonna have to apologize,

35:11.037 --> 35:14.604
- but I cannot take the distance that you keep creating...
- I don't wanna talk about this.

35:14.606 --> 35:17.844
We are gonna discuss this with Dr. Levin
on Monday, so I need you to...

35:19.078 --> 35:20.747
I need you to trust me.

35:30.455 --> 35:31.423
I trust you.

36:16.068 --> 36:17.469
Oh my God.

36:20.940 --> 36:24.074
Since when did you start
drinking diet soda?

36:24.076 --> 36:27.577
Since my metabolism stopped
working. We're old, Goh.

36:27.579 --> 36:28.681
You still look good.

36:29.447 --> 36:30.413
So, do you.

36:30.415 --> 36:31.083
Liar.

36:31.984 --> 36:33.853
No, seriously, fatherhood,
it suits you.

36:34.787 --> 36:37.389
How about you? You ever think
about becoming a mom, or...

36:38.623 --> 36:39.692
Cheers.

36:40.693 --> 36:42.159
What are we toasting to?

36:42.161 --> 36:45.729
Oh. Um, our high school reunion.

36:45.731 --> 36:48.431
Oh yeah. Go Cougars!

36:48.433 --> 36:49.101
Go Cougars.

36:50.937 --> 36:51.869
Should we sit down?

36:51.871 --> 36:52.738
Mm-hm.

36:53.639 --> 36:56.874
Sorry, I'm... I'm still
packing up here.

36:56.876 --> 37:00.780
Trying to
check out, crash with a friend.

37:04.150 --> 37:06.951
You know, there's such a thing
as a maid service, Goh.

37:06.953 --> 37:09.419
Then you have to tip them
every single day.

37:09.421 --> 37:12.758
Oh, but you should still be
tipping them every single day.

37:13.592 --> 37:17.362
My life did not turn out
as fancy as yours, so.

37:18.197 --> 37:19.196
What?

37:19.198 --> 37:21.600
- Amy gives me updates.
- Oh.

37:22.201 --> 37:26.469
Seems like you guys are pretty successful.
You and your husband. Josh?

37:26.471 --> 37:27.139
Mm-hm.

37:27.807 --> 37:29.075
You guys are happy though?

37:30.609 --> 37:31.978
Mm-hm, we're solid.

37:35.915 --> 37:38.082
Hey, I'm sorry it didn't work
out with "The Professor."

37:38.084 --> 37:39.717
No, you're not. You hate her.

37:39.719 --> 37:40.651
I don't hate her.

37:40.653 --> 37:42.152
You hate her.

37:42.154 --> 37:42.955
She hates me.

37:44.489 --> 37:46.959
I'm sorry I let things
get so weird.

37:47.660 --> 37:48.993
It's okay.

37:48.995 --> 37:50.395
3I asked her to marry me.

37:51.797 --> 37:54.066
She
obviously did not want that.

37:56.035 --> 37:58.702
I don't know what else I can do,
you know?

37:58.704 --> 38:01.571
I pretty much gave up
music for her.

38:01.573 --> 38:02.440
Erika said that?

38:03.142 --> 38:04.909
Not in those words exactly.

38:04.911 --> 38:06.509
What words?

38:06.511 --> 38:10.582
Did she say that, "Goh Nakamura,
you're never allowed to play music again?"

38:11.050 --> 38:12.548
She didn't have to say anything.

38:12.550 --> 38:17.520
I mean, who wants the father of their
child to be a struggling musician?

38:17.522 --> 38:20.858
Yeah, but to get rid of your
guitar, that's really extreme, Goh.

38:20.860 --> 38:23.861
It's a distraction. It's
a big life change.

38:23.863 --> 38:28.632
You're telling me that your kid has never
heard you play guitar or sing before?

38:28.634 --> 38:34.539
She's heard the CDs and stuff, but it's not
like I've ever serenaded her or anything.

38:35.641 --> 38:37.609
Tell you what, I'll let you
practice on me.

38:39.111 --> 38:40.510
One song.

38:40.512 --> 38:41.245
No.

38:41.247 --> 38:43.714
Yeah. "Surrogate Valentine."

38:43.716 --> 38:45.015
No.

38:45.017 --> 38:45.950
Duet version.

38:45.952 --> 38:48.721
No. I really don't want to.

38:51.891 --> 38:52.925
Okay.

38:59.966 --> 39:01.867
Josh is cheating on me.

39:04.737 --> 39:05.869
Did you hear what I said?

39:05.871 --> 39:10.040
Yeah. No, I... didn't you just
say you guys were solid?

39:10.042 --> 39:13.813
We are. We're in therapy.
We're working shit out.

39:15.047 --> 39:17.281
I'm sorry. You deserve better.

39:17.283 --> 39:18.851
Yeah? You think I deserve you?

39:19.617 --> 39:21.053
You deserve a lot
better than me.

39:27.727 --> 39:31.295
No, I'm fine. Don't get up
or anything. I'm fine.

39:31.297 --> 39:32.999
I mean, shit, I don't
want to stop you...

39:35.600 --> 39:37.036
Nope, I keep getting myself.

39:40.940 --> 39:45.011
Hey, do you remember that weekend before
I left for college, when I slept over?

39:45.978 --> 39:49.181
Mm-hm. Yeah. You were drunk.

39:50.049 --> 39:53.085
I was pretending to be passed
out in your bed.

39:55.154 --> 39:59.258
Around curfew, I just... I
pretended and then, um,

40:00.659 --> 40:03.262
I was just lying in your bed,
waiting for you to make a move.

40:04.730 --> 40:07.331
And I wasn't about to take
advantage of a drunk girl.

40:07.333 --> 40:09.201
Well, but I wasn't drunk.

40:09.969 --> 40:11.003
I didn't know that.

41:20.840 --> 41:21.874
You're back early.

41:22.808 --> 41:24.210
Everything all right?

41:27.113 --> 41:27.980
Okay.

41:31.183 --> 41:32.051
Hi.

41:35.688 --> 41:36.987
Are you drunk?

41:36.989 --> 41:39.823
Two drinks! I had two drinks.

41:39.825 --> 41:41.861
Two dr... And you drove?

41:43.729 --> 41:46.866
Okay. Honey, I really need
you to shut up, okay?

41:49.068 --> 41:53.437
I don't know what movie you saw,
but I like how crazy it is making you.

41:53.439 --> 41:54.840
I'm not crazy.

41:56.041 --> 41:57.374
I didn't say you were crazy.

41:57.376 --> 41:58.876
I'm not crazy.

41:58.878 --> 41:59.843
Okay.

41:59.845 --> 42:00.779
Say it!

42:01.981 --> 42:03.115
You're not crazy.

42:07.353 --> 42:08.387
I'm not crazy.

42:25.971 --> 42:28.272
She stopped liking my photos.

42:28.274 --> 42:29.206
What?

42:29.208 --> 42:31.010
She stopped liking my photos.

42:31.510 --> 42:32.912
You're being a stalker.

42:37.316 --> 42:40.019
Actually, I think you're the
one with the stalker.

42:40.753 --> 42:41.420
What?

42:42.321 --> 42:44.021
Goh's outside.

42:44.023 --> 42:44.890
What?

42:47.893 --> 42:48.961
Oh my God!

42:50.396 --> 42:52.529
How long
have you been out there?

42:52.531 --> 42:54.331
Long enough to hear you
don't have a chorus.

42:54.333 --> 42:58.936
You know, like we're dating,
we're vibing, it's all going well.

42:58.938 --> 43:01.205
I feel like she's super into me,

43:01.207 --> 43:04.308
and finally I'm just like so stoked
that I can stop dating dumb dudes,

43:04.310 --> 43:05.442
you know?

43:05.444 --> 43:07.377
Like who want to stick
their tongue down your throat

43:07.379 --> 43:08.812
and don't know how to
touch you?

43:08.814 --> 43:11.150
And then she just goes M. I. A.

43:12.484 --> 43:13.352
I don't get it.

43:14.887 --> 43:17.054
Ah, come on. Don't stop.

43:17.056 --> 43:18.155
Did you just write that?

43:18.157 --> 43:19.256
Mm-hm.

43:19.258 --> 43:20.390
You miss your calluses, huh?

43:20.392 --> 43:22.392
Yeah. They're buttery soft now.

43:22.394 --> 43:24.930
It kind of reminds
me of something.

43:25.965 --> 43:27.800
Like a children's song?

43:31.270 --> 43:33.472
Fuck you. Fuck you.

43:34.240 --> 43:37.541
Sadly, I can't right now, but
thanks for the invitation.

43:37.543 --> 43:41.747
I'm just gonna go study.
You two behave.

43:42.281 --> 43:43.280
Okay.

43:43.282 --> 43:44.316
Oh!

43:45.818 --> 43:47.119
Yeah, hah!

43:48.053 --> 43:51.088
Trying to let you go.

43:51.090 --> 43:54.458
I'm gonna, frankly, destroy your song
right now, but we'll put it back together.

43:54.460 --> 43:55.693
That's why... we're...

43:55.695 --> 43:59.396
Yeah. You gotta break the egg
before you make the omelet.

43:59.398 --> 44:02.399
We need a hook, so here's my next
hook to lead into the chorus,

44:02.401 --> 44:03.902
where you gotta go, uh...

44:05.004 --> 44:07.037
I feel like you're
making fun of me.

44:07.039 --> 44:08.205
No, no.

44:08.207 --> 44:11.174
No, I'm just having
fun with you, but...

44:11.176 --> 44:12.309
All right, yeah.

44:12.311 --> 44:14.880
I don't know, I'm sorry, I'm
sorry. I'm sorry, okay.

To drink and have
fun. Okay, let's...

45:19.978 --> 45:21.646

45:21.648 --> 45:24.348

perfect third with the...

Oh. Let's see.

45:30.055 --> 45:30.923
Wait.

45:34.026 --> 45:35.225
I gotta drink more.

45:35.227 --> 45:38.328
Mm-mm. This is so good.

45:38.330 --> 45:39.898
It's amazing.

45:41.333 --> 45:42.432
You want some more?

45:42.434 --> 45:43.634
Yeah, please.

45:43.636 --> 45:45.402
Hey, can I tell you something?

45:45.404 --> 45:46.637
What's that?

45:46.639 --> 45:50.574
Um, remember that time that we
hung out in Vegas and stuff,

45:50.576 --> 45:52.578
and we had like that super fun
night?

45:53.713 --> 45:57.614
Anyway, I didn't think
we're talking after that,

45:57.616 --> 45:58.982
and I know it's kinda heavy,

45:58.984 --> 46:02.085
but I heard through the grapevine
that you were getting married,

46:02.087 --> 46:06.225
and I know that you actually haven't
gotten married or anything, but like...

46:07.493 --> 46:10.661
whatever, I had all these feelings,
so I wrote a song about it.

46:10.663 --> 46:13.096
Really? Can I hear it?

46:13.098 --> 46:16.566
Okay, why... yeah, what, yeah. Okay.
Fuck it. Can I play your guitar?

46:16.568 --> 46:21.037
Of course, yeah. Yeah.
Goh-hana. You played her before.

46:21.039 --> 46:21.940
Oh, Goh-hana!

46:23.509 --> 46:25.477
Yeah. She'd be honored.

46:26.412 --> 46:29.714
All right. Okay, for real?

46:29.716 --> 46:30.648
Yeah.

46:30.650 --> 46:32.082
Okay, well,

46:32.084 --> 46:37.156
I just want to say
before I sing this, um...

46:38.490 --> 46:39.657
don't be offended, okay?

46:39.659 --> 46:42.094
This was
like kind of a long time ago.

46:42.695 --> 46:45.696
- Yeah, no worries.
- I didn't think I was gonna ever see you ever again.

46:45.698 --> 46:48.432
Wow. I'm sorry, but uh...

46:48.434 --> 46:50.703

Erika, I'm...
I'm so sorry for your loss.

50:02.862 --> 50:08.868
This is a song I wrote 15 years ago
for my uncle who had passed away.

50:11.603 --> 50:16.974
I sold it to a pharmaceutical
company called Relatrix,

50:16.976 --> 50:20.847
so if you're prescribed to Relatrix,
maybe this will sound familiar.

50:24.684 --> 50:26.753
Anyway, this one's
for you, Mr. Abe.

Well done.

52:00.345 --> 52:01.246
Thank you.

52:05.651 --> 52:06.819
I'm an orphan now.

52:08.921 --> 52:09.789
Yeah.

52:10.455 --> 52:11.824
I know. That's weird.

52:13.693 --> 52:14.559
Yeah.

52:15.061 --> 52:17.029
Why doesn't it hurt more?

52:26.338 --> 52:30.540
You should still be playing.
That's what makes you happy.

52:30.542 --> 52:33.713
Sachiko makes me happier
than music ever did.

52:34.680 --> 52:37.114
You know, I applied
for a job here.

52:37.116 --> 52:40.985
I know. Julia told me earlier.

52:40.987 --> 52:42.621
I'm tired of Madison.

52:43.588 --> 52:44.456
Me too.

52:46.993 --> 52:50.730
I want Sachiko to see her parents
following their dreams, you know?

52:54.867 --> 52:56.535
Aren't you gonna say
something?

52:58.503 --> 53:02.642
I just wonder if my race has
already been run, you know?

53:07.680 --> 53:09.414
Someone just dropped this off.

53:10.582 --> 53:12.783
- Sachiko's looking for you.
- Oh, shit.

53:12.785 --> 53:14.854
- Who are they from?
- I don't know.

54:14.680 --> 54:16.615
Oh, wow,
look how good this looks.

54:17.650 --> 54:20.552
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I like, love it.
Thank you, thank you.

54:21.586 --> 54:26.458
But wait, I'm gonna move back a little bit.
Oh my god, I love it!

54:29.962 --> 54:33.833
Oh, wow. I haven't
smiled in weeks.

54:35.067 --> 54:37.134
I'm really sorry about your dad.

54:37.136 --> 54:40.072
Thank you. It's been a lot to
deal with.

54:43.508 --> 54:44.476
I know...

54:45.711 --> 54:47.747
you went to
Goh's room the other night.

54:48.981 --> 54:50.648
Nothing happened.

54:50.650 --> 54:52.149
I know.

54:52.151 --> 54:57.056
Nothing's ever happened with me and Goh.
I mean, we've never even kissed.

54:57.957 --> 54:58.889
Never?

54:58.891 --> 55:00.691
No, not even on prom night.

55:00.693 --> 55:01.792
Why not?

55:01.794 --> 55:03.961
It just never happened.
Thank you.

55:03.963 --> 55:05.663
Do you ladies know
what you want?

55:05.665 --> 55:07.532
Uh. Not yet, sorry.

55:10.703 --> 55:13.904
Well, it's okay if something
did happen between the two...

55:13.906 --> 55:16.140
Nothing happened,
and I'm married.

55:16.142 --> 55:20.112
I know, but what I'm trying to
say is that...

55:21.747 --> 55:22.815
I understand.

55:23.950 --> 55:26.986
I accept that you're an
important part of his life.

55:27.853 --> 55:29.055
Thank you for saying that.

55:29.822 --> 55:32.089
I might move back here,

55:32.091 --> 55:35.127
and I don't know if Goh and I
will ever get back together.

55:36.696 --> 55:37.363
But...

55:39.198 --> 55:41.599
I know how he
feels about you.

55:44.904 --> 55:46.072
He loves you.

55:47.173 --> 55:48.908
He's always loved you.

55:51.310 --> 55:52.608
Wait, he told you that?

55:52.610 --> 55:53.478
No.

55:54.013 --> 55:55.081
But it's obvious.

55:56.816 --> 55:57.984
What's that like?

55:59.051 --> 56:03.155
To know, whatever
happens, how much time passes,

56:04.056 --> 56:07.226
you guys are always connected?

56:08.894 --> 56:13.099
All that history you guys have,
I can't compete.

56:14.100 --> 56:16.635
I'm sure your
husband knows how I feel.

56:18.137 --> 56:19.005
Yeah.

56:29.148 --> 56:30.714
I thought you were
playing basketball.

56:30.716 --> 56:34.785
Yeah, I was going to, then I thought
it might be nice to drive up to Malibu

56:34.787 --> 56:37.857
and watch the sunset, have
dinner on the beach.

56:39.624 --> 56:41.027
Did you make a reservation?

56:42.228 --> 56:43.160
Nah.

56:43.162 --> 56:45.164
Okay. Do you want me to?

56:45.898 --> 56:48.232
No, it's cool. I was trying to
remember the name of that place

56:48.234 --> 56:49.900
that Rachelle and Brandon told
us about,

56:49.902 --> 56:55.141
and then I remembered that Rachelle was
gonna send you a text with the name of it.

56:56.242 --> 56:57.109
So...

57:05.384 --> 57:08.618
That "random musician," that
Goh guy?

57:08.620 --> 57:10.620
You're having drinks
with him in his motel room?

57:10.622 --> 57:12.923
What are you doing looking
through my text messages?

57:12.925 --> 57:15.626
- We talked about this with Dr. Levin...
- No, we talked

57:15.628 --> 57:20.666
about you not reading my text messages,
because I was the one that fucked up.

57:22.768 --> 57:25.669
- Okay. I'm sorry.
- What did you do with him? What did you do with him?

57:25.671 --> 57:26.904
I did nothing with him.

57:26.906 --> 57:29.108
Well then who the hell is he?
Why don't I know about him?

57:30.176 --> 57:31.844
Um, he's nobody. He's...

57:32.945 --> 57:34.178
No, that's not true. He's, um...

57:34.180 --> 57:35.946
Are you some kind of
groupie or something?

57:35.948 --> 57:37.815
Oh my god, no! No, no, no...

57:37.817 --> 57:41.654
Well, then why do you need to get drunk with him
in his motel in order to fuck your husband?

57:47.259 --> 57:48.627
Do you love him?

57:54.166 --> 57:55.201
I'm sorry.

57:57.670 --> 57:59.772
I just don't feel
like myself right now.

58:08.981 --> 58:12.149
That's a guitar pick.
Were you trying to eat it?

58:12.151 --> 58:13.250
No.

58:13.252 --> 58:16.153
You weren't? Okay, good.
Do you know what it does?

58:16.155 --> 58:17.688
Yeah.

58:17.690 --> 58:18.991
You know, you wanna try?

58:20.759 --> 58:23.362
Good job. That's an A chord.
Now let's do it again.

58:24.964 --> 58:26.765
That's a D chord.

58:27.233 --> 58:29.268
You know what
we can sing with that?

58:29.935 --> 58:31.268
No.

58:31.270 --> 58:33.337
We can do "Twinkle, Twinkle,
Little Star." You want to do that?

58:33.339 --> 58:35.875
- Let's do ABC.
- Okay, let's do ABC.

59:04.470 --> 59:07.206
You know, I was thinking about
what Jasmine was saying.

59:07.907 --> 59:09.206
Oh, what'd she say?

59:09.208 --> 59:11.842
About kids' songs, you know?
What should I write a song about?

59:11.844 --> 59:12.676
I don't know.

59:12.678 --> 59:14.947
You don't know?
How about unicorns?

59:15.414 --> 59:16.747
What about boogers?

59:16.749 --> 59:18.184
Should I write a song about
boogers?

59:18.817 --> 59:22.186

59:22.188 --> 59:23.153

59:25.424 --> 59:27.925

59:38.170 --> 59:42.005
Before you become the next Raffi,
can you help me finish my song?

59:42.007 --> 59:44.443
Deal. That sounds good.

59:52.851 --> 59:54.818
Hey, Sachiko, guess what.

59:54.820 --> 59:59.456
- What?
- I got a present for you. It's a...

59:59.458 --> 01:00:02.127
- Do you mind watching her for me?
- What? Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:00:03.495 --> 01:00:04.428
Hey, what's up?

01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:06.230
I'm in the car right
now. Where are you?

Hey.

01:00:32.324 --> 01:00:33.192
Hey.

01:00:33.892 --> 01:00:35.492
Do you want a drink?

01:00:35.494 --> 01:00:36.927
What do you have?

01:00:36.929 --> 01:00:41.333
I've got beer and water.

01:00:42.534 --> 01:00:43.535
I'll have water.

01:00:47.072 --> 01:00:49.308
Do you want a,
do you want a bite of mine?

01:00:50.843 --> 01:00:53.979
Hey, Sachiko, this is my oldest
friend, Rachel.

01:00:58.517 --> 01:00:59.616
How old are you?

01:00:59.618 --> 01:01:02.554
- Oh. We don't ask grown-ups that.
- Yeah.

01:01:04.156 --> 01:01:06.959
Are you hungry? You
want to sit down?

01:01:07.493 --> 01:01:09.428
Actually, can we go
somewhere and talk?

01:01:14.967 --> 01:01:19.002
Hey, Yea-Ming, do you mind hanging
out with Sachiko for a little bit

01:01:19.004 --> 01:01:21.240
while I talk with
Rachel outside?

01:01:22.308 --> 01:01:25.509
Yeah. Mm-hmm. Sure.

01:01:25.511 --> 01:01:27.012
Thank you.

01:01:30.916 --> 01:01:33.919
That should keep
her busy. Thanks.

01:01:47.634 --> 01:01:49.066
Hey, are you okay?

01:01:49.068 --> 01:01:52.102
I'm just gonna do something,
and I just want you to go with it, okay?

01:01:52.104 --> 01:01:53.038
What?

01:02:02.448 --> 01:02:05.982
Wait, hold on. What's
going on? What's going on?

01:02:05.984 --> 01:02:09.553
Stop laughing, Goh. What?

01:02:09.555 --> 01:02:13.557
- This is bonkers.
- This is bonkers? Shut up!

01:02:13.559 --> 01:02:16.028
- I didn't say anything!
- Stop laughing!

01:02:16.495 --> 01:02:20.199
Stop it. Oh my God!

01:02:21.066 --> 01:02:22.201
All right.

01:02:23.168 --> 01:02:24.669
Try it again?

01:02:24.671 --> 01:02:27.938
I'm sorry, I wasn't ready. Try
it again, try it again.

01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:31.310
Me try it again? You frickin'
try it again. You try it.

01:02:38.685 --> 01:02:41.253
Rachel. What are we doing?

01:02:46.959 --> 01:02:49.128
I'm sorry, Goh. I love you.

01:02:57.302 --> 01:02:58.170
Fuck.

01:03:05.043 --> 01:03:06.345
Tell Yea-Ming I'm sorry?

01:03:09.214 --> 01:03:10.149
Don't worry about it.

01:03:14.721 --> 01:03:15.686
I'm so embarrassed.

01:03:15.688 --> 01:03:17.289
Don't be, don't be.

01:03:21.026 --> 01:03:21.927
I love you.

01:03:31.203 --> 01:03:32.604
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:03:54.694 --> 01:03:55.628
What was that?

01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:00.032
I have no idea.

01:04:01.033 --> 01:04:02.032
What happened?

01:04:02.034 --> 01:04:03.166
Nothing really happened.

01:04:03.168 --> 01:04:04.069
What did she want?

01:04:06.038 --> 01:04:07.172
She didn't want anything.

01:04:09.374 --> 01:04:10.442
Oh, really?

01:04:13.579 --> 01:04:15.347
What are you not
telling me, Goh?

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:22.820
Do you want to be with her?

01:04:22.822 --> 01:04:25.424
Can we not talk about this
in front of Sachiko?

01:04:36.568 --> 01:04:38.003
What are we doing?

01:04:38.604 --> 01:04:40.303
What are we doing here?

01:04:40.305 --> 01:04:42.339
Sachiko's not my
kid, I'm not your babysitter.

01:04:42.341 --> 01:04:43.473
Yeah, I know. I know.

01:04:43.475 --> 01:04:46.779
- I'm not her mother. She's not like Goh-hana.
- I know.

01:04:47.579 --> 01:04:50.547
- What?
- Goh-hana, your fucking guitar!

01:04:50.549 --> 01:04:54.251
I know what you're talking about.
I know who you're referring to...

01:04:54.253 --> 01:04:56.520
She's not just someone you can
fucking drop off at my house

01:04:56.522 --> 01:04:58.288
anytime you can't figure out
your life.

01:04:58.290 --> 01:04:59.222
You have no idea.

01:04:59.224 --> 01:05:01.527
I've got a life I've gotta
figure out too!

01:05:03.195 --> 01:05:05.663
I can't be this girl.
I can't be this girl.

01:05:05.665 --> 01:05:08.367
- What are you talking about?
- I can't be this fucking girl.

01:05:09.268 --> 01:05:12.369
This "I-don't-give-a-fuck-
who-you're-fucking" girl.

01:05:12.371 --> 01:05:13.603
I'm not fucking anyone.

01:05:13.605 --> 01:05:16.508
You were just fucking making out
with Rachel on my sidewalk.

01:05:17.442 --> 01:05:19.378
You were just... oh my God!

01:05:20.747 --> 01:05:22.347
- I was what?
- Fuck.

01:05:29.288 --> 01:05:31.490
Oh, thank you. Come here.

01:05:33.325 --> 01:05:34.659
Your nose, blow...

01:05:34.661 --> 01:05:36.829
I am too old for this.

01:06:18.738 --> 01:06:21.404
<i>Hey. It's Josh.</i>

01:06:21.406 --> 01:06:23.440
<i>Listen, I'm not mad at you.</i>

01:06:23.442 --> 01:06:26.612
<i>I just... I
need to cool off and think.</i>

01:06:28.547 --> 01:06:29.613
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:06:29.615 --> 01:06:30.717
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

01:06:31.818 --> 01:06:33.619
<i>When I get back, we can talk
about everything.</i>

01:06:34.453 --> 01:06:35.320
<i>I love you.</i>

01:06:36.221 --> 01:06:37.255
<i>All right, bye.</i>

01:06:39.759 --> 01:06:41.159
Is that my shirt?

01:06:42.294 --> 01:06:44.463
No, it was my dad's.

01:06:45.798 --> 01:06:47.634
Looks really good on you.

01:07:10.555 --> 01:07:12.089
<i>I gotta
tell you something.</i>

01:07:12.091 --> 01:07:15.626
You can't get upset with me, because
ultimately it doesn't mean anything.

01:07:15.628 --> 01:07:18.430
Rachel and I kissed
earlier today.

01:07:18.931 --> 01:07:22.532
It was terrible, awful.

01:07:22.534 --> 01:07:25.836
No, it's funny because I used to
daydream about it when I was a kid,

01:07:25.838 --> 01:07:30.875
you know, and the
reality of it was just, nah.

01:07:30.877 --> 01:07:31.844
Nah?

01:07:33.412 --> 01:07:34.279
Nah.

01:07:36.281 --> 01:07:38.918
<i>You know, I've been thinking</i>

01:07:39.686 --> 01:07:42.254
<i>about how things used to be.</i>

01:07:44.023 --> 01:07:49.194
<i>I'm sorry if I made you feel like you
couldn't have a life outside of us.</i>

01:07:51.263 --> 01:07:52.065
<i>We used to be...</i>

01:07:55.802 --> 01:07:58.638
<i>I just
want us to, I don't know...</i>

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:02.975
<i>Stop making it so hard.</i>

01:08:03.676 --> 01:08:04.543
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:08:06.378 --> 01:08:10.613
I don't know. I was thinking that
moving to LA isn't such a bad idea.

01:08:10.615 --> 01:08:13.383
I could probably get a transfer
to the LA office,

01:08:13.385 --> 01:08:17.890
maybe get an apartment close to
you and Sachiko?

01:08:19.591 --> 01:08:20.459
Or...

01:08:23.528 --> 01:08:26.398
You could just save the money

01:08:27.365 --> 01:08:30.535
and live here with us.

01:08:53.591 --> 01:08:54.459
Good night.

01:09:17.649 --> 01:09:18.716
<i>We ready?</i>

01:09:18.718 --> 01:09:20.117

01:09:20.118 --> 01:09:23.022
