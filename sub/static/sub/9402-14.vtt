00:24.074 --> 00:25.074
Ugh!

00:25.126 --> 00:27.243
Ouch!
Brooke, what the hell?!

00:28.379 --> 00:29.912
Was I sleep-fighting
again?

00:29.964 --> 00:31.131
Yes.

00:31.215 --> 00:33.133
No more "Kick-Ass"
for my wife before bed.

00:34.835 --> 00:36.936
You said "wife."

00:37.021 --> 00:38.638
I love hearing that.

00:40.558 --> 00:42.142
Mm.
Where you going?

00:42.226 --> 00:44.627
Work. I'm directing
a commercial today. Remember?

00:44.695 --> 00:45.729
No!

00:45.796 --> 00:47.313
So now
the honeymoon's over,

00:47.398 --> 00:49.616
and we're just gonna turn into
a boring, old married couple?

00:49.700 --> 00:51.151
Uh, you fight in your sleep,
Brooke.

00:51.235 --> 00:52.952
Any couple you're a part of
couldn't be boring.

00:54.104 --> 00:56.873
What am I supposed to do
without you?

00:56.940 --> 00:58.107
I don't know.

00:58.159 --> 01:00.076
Go to the grocery store?
Run errands? Cook?

01:01.612 --> 01:05.165
Things a boring, old husband
would say for $500, please.

01:05.248 --> 01:07.050
Or you could
watch "Kick-Ass" again.

01:08.586 --> 01:09.669
We have a winner.

01:14.625 --> 01:17.010
Breakfast?
What's the special occasion?

01:17.094 --> 01:19.396
Marvin's first day
back in television.

01:19.463 --> 01:21.130
Yep,
I have come full circle

01:21.182 --> 01:23.099
and ended up
back at the bottom.

01:23.150 --> 01:25.301
There's nothing wrong
with starting over.

01:25.352 --> 01:26.853
Julian
wouldn't have hired you

01:26.937 --> 01:28.321
if he didn't think
you were talented.

01:28.406 --> 01:29.472
I'm proud of you.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.941
Anyway, I should
probably head home.

01:31.992 --> 01:33.076
I'll see you tonight?

01:33.143 --> 01:34.327
Bye.

01:36.597 --> 01:37.947
You do know
it's kind of mean

01:37.998 --> 01:39.616
to make her do the walk of shame
every day, right?

01:40.868 --> 01:42.285
When are you two
moving back in together?

01:42.336 --> 01:44.337
We're taking it slow.
Man, "slow"?

01:44.422 --> 01:46.122
If you go any slower,
you're gonna be going backwards.

01:46.173 --> 01:47.624
What you gonna do,
take her on a date

01:47.675 --> 01:49.876
and try to figure out what her
favorite flavor of ice cream is?

01:49.960 --> 01:50.877
It's rocky road.

01:50.961 --> 01:52.378
And I don't think

01:52.463 --> 01:54.214
that <i>you</i> should be giving
relationship advice.

01:54.298 --> 01:56.599
You wanted to propose to
Nathan's mom on your third date.

01:56.667 --> 02:01.504
♪ You had your young mind
in the gutter ♪

02:01.555 --> 02:08.094
♪ you had your feet

02:08.162 --> 02:10.179
♪ see you on the way up ♪

02:10.231 --> 02:12.398
Damn. You're good.

02:12.483 --> 02:13.683
I know.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.985
It's still nice
to hear.

02:16.036 --> 02:18.321
You want to know which
picture is my favorite? Hmm?

02:21.358 --> 02:22.559
<i>You</i> took that one.

02:22.626 --> 02:24.544
Did I?
Oh, that's right -- I did.

02:24.628 --> 02:26.379
I had forgotten
'cause it was just so easy.

02:26.464 --> 02:27.747
All I had to do
was point and click.

02:27.832 --> 02:30.032
Mm. That's 'cause I set
my camera to "idiot mode."

02:30.084 --> 02:31.918
Hey, there's no need
to be nasty.

02:32.002 --> 02:34.337
You're probably
a better photographer than I am.

02:34.388 --> 02:35.872
There's just
no way to tell.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.206
Oh, yes, there is.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.642
I've gotten three job offers
since posting these.

02:39.710 --> 02:41.845
Did you --
did you post the one I took?

02:41.896 --> 02:43.813
Just because those offers
may have been for <i>me.</i>

02:43.881 --> 02:45.348
Hmm.
Maybe they were.

02:47.017 --> 02:50.270
Let's go do something fun today
Like bungee jumping.

02:50.354 --> 02:51.488
Let's go bungee jumping.

02:51.555 --> 02:52.856
No way.

02:52.907 --> 02:55.325
You see, I have a strict policy
against doing anything

02:55.392 --> 02:57.443
where people won't feel sorry
for you if you die.

02:57.528 --> 02:59.279
For example,
you'll never hear anyone say,

02:59.363 --> 03:00.613
"oh, that poor guy.

03:00.698 --> 03:02.332
"He just wanted to tie a rope
around his ankles

03:02.399 --> 03:04.250
and jump off a bridge."

03:04.335 --> 03:07.670
Okay, maybe not <i>that,</i>
<i>but something thrilling.</i>

03:07.738 --> 03:09.622
Hmm.

03:09.707 --> 03:11.073
I think
I know what you need.

03:13.010 --> 03:14.794
Uh --

03:19.800 --> 03:22.986
What's the answer, dummy?

03:23.053 --> 03:25.605
It's "Tommy." And you didn't
ask me a question.

03:25.689 --> 03:29.108
Fat, drunk, and stupid is no way
to go through life, son.

03:29.193 --> 03:31.761
How are you going to
practice business law

03:31.829 --> 03:34.931
if you can't predict
my questions ahead of time?

03:34.982 --> 03:37.116
I just
don't understand.

03:37.201 --> 03:40.269
Maybe you'll understand <i>this.</i>

03:43.273 --> 03:46.776
♪ Ask me to fetch your crown ♪

03:49.213 --> 03:50.780
Come on, man.
That didn't happen.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.916
Plus, you're quoting lines
from "Animal House."

03:52.967 --> 03:54.834
Okay, maybe I exaggerated
a <i>little.</i>

03:54.919 --> 03:56.419
But the guy
is a nightmare.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.555
He gets off
on humiliating everyone.

03:58.622 --> 04:01.307
Eh, so study. I mean, he can't make you
look stupid if you know the material.

04:01.392 --> 04:03.643
And, besides, I mean,
didn't you take this guy's class

04:03.727 --> 04:05.144
'cause it was tough?

04:05.229 --> 04:06.846
I don't have a problem
with him being tough.

04:06.931 --> 04:08.348
I have a problem
with him being a bully.

04:08.432 --> 04:10.400
Mm, it <i>is</i> his class.

04:10.467 --> 04:12.518
Look, you got
one of two options --

04:12.603 --> 04:14.821
either switch professors
or deal with it.

04:14.905 --> 04:16.439
It's too late to switch.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.440
Well, then
"deal with it" wins.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.276
Otherwise,
you can't be an Agent.

04:27.284 --> 04:29.485
Chase isn't here.

04:29.536 --> 04:31.487
Oh,
and the cease-fire is off

04:31.538 --> 04:33.122
because you kissed him
during our truce.

04:33.173 --> 04:35.258
And you slept with him
during the reception.

04:35.325 --> 04:37.460
But it doesn't matter.
I'm not here for Chase.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.178
He suddenly
seemed less attractive

04:39.263 --> 04:40.546
when I saw him
in the limo

04:40.614 --> 04:42.382
with a 5-foot hairy mole
attached to him.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.885
Anyway, I wanted
to talk to Haley

04:45.970 --> 04:47.720
about
recording a song here.

04:47.805 --> 04:50.306
Since when do you sing?

04:50.374 --> 04:51.691
I'm serious.

04:51.775 --> 04:54.143
I know.
That's why I'm laughing.

04:54.194 --> 04:56.145
Well, like I said,
I came to ask Haley, not you.

04:56.196 --> 04:59.148
Why talk to the greasy rag when
you can talk to the mechanic?

05:04.538 --> 05:06.039
Haley thinks
what <i>I</i> think.

05:07.625 --> 05:08.541
We'll see.

05:08.626 --> 05:10.026

So, it's a recruitment commercial

06:09.223 --> 06:11.536
for Tree Hill College,
and if things go well,

06:11.618 --> 06:13.252
it could lead to more work
for both of us.

06:13.320 --> 06:14.670
Hey, thanks again
for the job.

06:14.755 --> 06:16.456
It's nice to be needed
for something

06:16.507 --> 06:17.823
other than
cleaning toilets.

06:17.875 --> 06:19.658
Uh, we have a problem
with Michael.

06:19.710 --> 06:21.177
Our actor.

06:21.261 --> 06:22.828
Let me guess --
he flooded the bathroom?

06:22.880 --> 06:24.046
No, no.

06:24.131 --> 06:26.349
Uh...Well, yes.

06:26.433 --> 06:29.185
But he has a problem
with his lines, too.

06:29.269 --> 06:30.186
What's the problem?

06:30.270 --> 06:31.637
He doesn't know them.

06:31.688 --> 06:34.673
I'm on it.

06:34.725 --> 06:36.526
I need a script
and a plunger.

06:43.901 --> 06:46.702
If I didn't hate men
right now,

06:46.787 --> 06:48.654
you'd be in trouble.

06:48.705 --> 06:50.189
Yep.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.524
Men suck.

06:51.575 --> 06:52.525
Mm.

06:55.829 --> 06:57.029
Hey.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.582
So, I was just checking in.
Are we cool?

06:59.666 --> 07:01.250
Because, you know,
we haven't really talked

07:01.335 --> 07:04.203
since the...Um...
Wedding.

07:04.254 --> 07:06.339
Of course.

07:06.406 --> 07:08.975
We said the slutty wedding sex
didn't have to mean anything.

07:09.042 --> 07:11.060
Well, <i>you</i> said that.
Uh, I just agreed.

07:13.013 --> 07:14.213
So, nothing's wrong?

07:14.264 --> 07:15.348
No.

07:15.399 --> 07:17.183
At least not with <i>us.</i>

07:17.234 --> 07:18.884
So what <i>is</i> wrong?

07:21.021 --> 07:23.556
I started this job
because Owen needed my help.

07:23.607 --> 07:26.108
It felt good knowing I was
making a difference.

07:26.193 --> 07:30.112
Now all I do
is help people get drunk.

07:30.197 --> 07:31.414
If you want
to help people,

07:31.498 --> 07:33.866
there's always somebody
who needs it, you know?

07:33.917 --> 07:36.068
You could always volunteer,
like Haley did.

07:36.119 --> 07:37.253
I could be
a Big Brother.

07:37.337 --> 07:38.737
I've always liked
playing with kids.

07:38.789 --> 07:40.556
Yeah,
don't say that out loud.

07:43.910 --> 07:45.127
Pshew!

07:45.212 --> 07:49.098
Who needs a clothing company
when you can fly?

07:49.183 --> 07:50.433
Oh, my God.

07:52.186 --> 07:53.553
Oh.
Hey.

07:53.604 --> 07:55.087
Finally.

07:55.155 --> 07:57.139
I am <i>so</i> bored, Hales.

07:57.224 --> 07:58.608
Not working
is killing me.

07:58.692 --> 08:02.228
Can I -- can I come and join you
at the crisis center?

08:02.279 --> 08:03.929
We could solve problems,

08:03.981 --> 08:07.033
like a...
Problem-solving...Duo.

08:08.318 --> 08:10.286
The truth is,
I signed up to help people,

08:10.370 --> 08:12.655
but I spend most of the day
playing "Angry Birds."

08:12.739 --> 08:14.273
Mm.

08:14.324 --> 08:16.442
I know
what'll make you feel better.

08:18.945 --> 08:21.397
The <i>mouth</i>
<i>on that little girl!</i>

08:21.465 --> 08:22.781
I know, right?

08:22.833 --> 08:25.251
See, why can't the crisis center
be more like this?

08:25.302 --> 08:27.003
People call in,
they ask for help,

08:27.087 --> 08:28.921
and we actually
help them.

08:28.972 --> 08:31.224
But, no,
we're told to just listen.

08:31.291 --> 08:35.443
You think anyone would ever
tell hit girl to just listen?

08:35.511 --> 08:37.763
♪ La la la, la-la la la ♪

08:37.813 --> 08:40.683
Hey. I just got your text.
What's the emergency?

08:40.767 --> 08:42.318
I didn't say
it was an emergency.

08:42.402 --> 08:43.519
I said
I wanted to talk.

08:43.604 --> 08:45.905
Oh. An emergency sounded
much more exciting.

08:45.972 --> 08:47.940
Anyway, what's up?
What's the problem?

08:47.991 --> 08:50.192
Have I told you
that before I started acting,

08:50.277 --> 08:51.878
I really wanted
to be a singer?

08:51.945 --> 08:54.113
Yes, several times
at Brooke's bachelorette party.

08:54.164 --> 08:55.281
Okay. Then shut up.

08:55.332 --> 08:56.866
The studio
is letting me record a song

08:56.934 --> 08:58.317
for the soundtrack
of my next movie.

08:58.368 --> 08:59.919
That's awesome!

08:59.986 --> 09:01.837
So, what's the emergency?

09:01.922 --> 09:04.006
Again, no emergency.

09:04.091 --> 09:05.174
I need a favor.

09:05.259 --> 09:06.825
I want to record
at Red Bedroom,

09:06.877 --> 09:08.711
but Mia won't let me
through the door.

09:08.795 --> 09:11.464
So you want me to help you
break in late at night

09:11.515 --> 09:12.715
and secretly record.

09:12.799 --> 09:13.999
No.

09:14.051 --> 09:16.835
I want you to ask Haley
if she'll let me do it.

09:18.272 --> 09:21.057
That's it?
Just...Talk to my sister?

09:21.141 --> 09:23.225
Sorry my problem
isn't more exciting.

09:23.310 --> 09:24.727
If it makes you
feel better,

09:24.811 --> 09:27.446
we can pretend Mia's an evil
villain that we have to thwart.

09:28.682 --> 09:29.848
I just said "thwart."

09:29.900 --> 09:31.016
So, will you?

09:31.068 --> 09:32.118
Yes, of course I will.

09:32.185 --> 09:33.452
But I doubt Mia will mind

09:33.520 --> 09:35.454
when she realizes
how much it means to you.

09:35.522 --> 09:37.123
You're wrong.

09:37.190 --> 09:39.292
What do you have to say
for yourself?

09:39.359 --> 09:40.660
That I wish
I was right?

09:42.195 --> 09:45.932
It seems the only question
you know the answer to is,

09:45.999 --> 09:47.500
"do you want dessert?"

09:49.252 --> 09:52.171
Wouldn't <i>everyone</i> know
the answer to that question?

09:52.239 --> 09:54.006
It's usually "yes."

09:55.425 --> 09:58.728
Well, if everyone
knows the answers,

09:58.812 --> 10:01.614
we don't need to prepare
any more for tomorrow's test.

10:03.567 --> 10:05.151
Good day, everyone.

10:12.943 --> 10:14.393
Good looking out,
dude.

10:14.444 --> 10:15.695
Hey, no big deal.

10:15.746 --> 10:18.397
Uh, yeah, it is.
He's a scary dude.

10:19.733 --> 10:22.201
Anyways, uh, me and some
of the guys get together

10:22.252 --> 10:24.286
twice a week
for a study group.

10:24.371 --> 10:27.506
Uh, we're actually meeting up
tonight, if you want in.

10:27.574 --> 10:30.092
Yeah, sounds great.
Where is it?

10:30.177 --> 10:31.677
Funny you should ask.

10:31.745 --> 10:33.295
It's your night to host.

10:34.848 --> 10:37.049
So...Where is it?

10:39.753 --> 10:40.936
My place, I guess.

10:52.599 --> 10:54.533

your new Big Brother.

10:54.601 --> 10:57.620
Only losers call me "Charles."
It's "Chuck."

10:59.072 --> 11:00.990
Hey, you're Jamie's friend,
right?

11:01.074 --> 11:02.491
The bartender.

11:02.576 --> 11:04.627
Bar <i>manager,</i> yeah.

11:04.711 --> 11:05.745
Ooooooh.

11:05.796 --> 11:07.363
So,
what are we doing today?

11:07.431 --> 11:10.449
How would you like
to go up in a plane?

11:10.500 --> 11:12.301
Cool! Where to?

11:12.386 --> 11:14.387
Just around Tree Hill,
maybe Pickerington.

11:14.454 --> 11:15.454
Okay.

11:15.505 --> 11:16.672
Nice hat.

even heard my idea.

11:58.279 --> 11:59.646
Fine. What is it?

11:59.697 --> 12:01.365
We should be superheroes.

12:01.449 --> 12:02.866
No.

12:02.951 --> 12:04.150
Come on!

12:04.252 --> 12:06.653
You love helping people.
I love designing clothes.

12:06.704 --> 12:09.456
You put those things together,
and voilà.

12:09.507 --> 12:12.509
"Voilà" is not exactly the word
I would use to describe <i>this.</i>

12:12.594 --> 12:13.510
Come on!

12:13.595 --> 12:14.928
You yourself said

12:14.996 --> 12:16.663
you wanted the crisis center
to be more like "Kick-Ass."

12:16.714 --> 12:18.682
We can use it
to find people who need help.

12:18.766 --> 12:20.050
It can be like
our own personal batphone.

12:20.134 --> 12:21.852
You are forgetting
an important detail,

12:21.936 --> 12:24.388
which is the fact that superheroes
have actual superpowers.

12:24.472 --> 12:26.957
Yes, but I am feisty,
and you're pregnant.

12:27.025 --> 12:28.508
Nobody's gonna hit
a pregnant lady!

12:28.559 --> 12:29.910
It's like your shield.

12:29.978 --> 12:31.678
You want me to use
my unborn baby as my shield?!

12:31.729 --> 12:33.730
Are you crazy?
Oh, come on!

12:33.815 --> 12:35.198
I need a sidekick.

12:35.283 --> 12:37.684
Sidekick?
Girl, give me a break.

12:37.735 --> 12:39.703
If anything,
we're gonna be a duo.

12:39.787 --> 12:41.538
So you're in.

12:41.623 --> 12:43.890
Aah!
Let's be superheroes!

12:43.958 --> 12:45.909
Uh...

12:47.295 --> 12:49.496
Exactly how much
did you hear?

12:49.547 --> 12:51.665
Enough?

12:51.716 --> 12:53.800
I'll just
come back later.

12:53.868 --> 12:54.885
Aah!

12:54.969 --> 12:57.537
I'm afraid
I can't let you do that.

12:57.588 --> 12:58.972
Okay.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.707
Okay, cut!

13:04.145 --> 13:05.228
Hi.

13:05.313 --> 13:06.730
Um, I hope it's okay
that I stopped by.

13:06.814 --> 13:08.265
I didn't know
if they'd give you lunch.

13:08.349 --> 13:09.566
Oh, thanks.

13:09.651 --> 13:11.318
Skills ate my breakfast.

13:11.385 --> 13:13.570
One of the downsides
of having a roommate.

13:13.655 --> 13:15.388
Is he back for long?

13:15.440 --> 13:17.240
I never know.

13:17.325 --> 13:19.693
He actually asked if you and I
were gonna move back in together.

13:19.744 --> 13:21.895
What did you say?

13:21.946 --> 13:23.447
That we were
taking it slow.

13:24.832 --> 13:26.033
Right?

13:26.084 --> 13:27.734
Right.

13:27.785 --> 13:31.204
Anyway, um, I'm gonna
let you get back to work.

13:36.410 --> 13:38.428
She seemed upset.
Did something happen?

13:38.513 --> 13:41.214
I think I just told her that
I didn't want to live with her.

13:43.384 --> 13:45.385
That'll do it.

13:48.272 --> 13:49.906
What's going on?

13:51.092 --> 13:52.693
It's quite simple,
really.

13:52.760 --> 13:56.446
Haley and I are Tree Hill's
newest superheroes.

13:56.531 --> 13:58.732
I didn't know
Tree Hill had <i>any</i> superheroes.

13:58.783 --> 14:01.601
Well, now that you know, you're
either with us or against us.

14:01.652 --> 14:03.120
We would prefer "with."

14:03.204 --> 14:04.705
She's kidding.
Obviously --

14:04.772 --> 14:06.139
I'm in!
Excellent!

14:06.207 --> 14:08.075
Now all we need is Haley
to go to the crisis center

14:08.126 --> 14:09.576
and find us
a problem to solve.

14:09.627 --> 14:11.778
I never said
that I would do this.

14:11.829 --> 14:13.163
There's
our first problem.

14:13.247 --> 14:14.631
You fix it.
I'm needed elsewhere.

14:24.342 --> 14:26.426
Do you want to know
why I became a Big Brother?

14:26.477 --> 14:29.462
'Cause
you have no friends.

14:29.514 --> 14:31.098
Chuck!

14:31.149 --> 14:32.465
Why?

14:32.517 --> 14:35.602
It's this new thing I invented.
You just got chucked.

14:35.653 --> 14:38.138
What if we just
high-five instead?

14:38.189 --> 14:40.023
High fives are lame.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.027
You know,
when I was a kid,

14:44.112 --> 14:46.279
I always wanted
to become a pilot.

14:46.330 --> 14:48.982
I want to be someone
who has their own pilot.

14:49.033 --> 14:52.202
My dad says if you're really
important, people fly <i>you.</i>

14:52.286 --> 14:55.505
I guess
<i>you're</i> not that important.

14:55.590 --> 14:56.673
Chuck!
Aah!

14:58.292 --> 14:59.793
Damn it.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.184
You can't be serious.

15:07.268 --> 15:08.185
Me?

15:08.269 --> 15:09.502
You're the one

15:09.554 --> 15:12.338
that keeps checking yourself out
in the mirror.

15:12.390 --> 15:14.024
You do look hot in that outfit,
by the way.

15:14.108 --> 15:15.475
Well, duh.

15:15.526 --> 15:17.194
Doesn't mean I'm gonna run
around playing make-believe.

15:17.278 --> 15:19.345
Come on.
It could be so much fun.

15:19.397 --> 15:21.198
Besides, ever since
my run-in with Katie,

15:21.282 --> 15:23.400
I've been feeling restless,
and I need excitement.

15:23.484 --> 15:24.734
Or some help.

15:24.819 --> 15:26.703
Yeah.

15:26.788 --> 15:28.688
Maybe I could be
our first mission.

15:28.739 --> 15:31.541
No. There's not gonna be
a first mission.

15:31.626 --> 15:33.493
Why are you here,
anyway?

15:33.544 --> 15:35.879
Oh. Um, right.
I need a favor.

15:35.947 --> 15:37.464
Alex wants to record
at the studio.

15:37.531 --> 15:38.698
She can even pay you
for it.

15:38.749 --> 15:39.883
Alex?

15:39.967 --> 15:42.035
I didn't --
I didn't even know she sang.

15:42.086 --> 15:44.805
Yeah. W-why didn't
she just ask me herself?

15:44.872 --> 15:46.539
She tried.
Mia chased her away.

15:46.591 --> 15:49.226
Great. Yeah, please,
tell her that's fine.

15:49.310 --> 15:50.677
I will talk to Mia.

15:50.728 --> 15:52.929
I'm having enough trouble
keeping people in the studio

15:53.014 --> 15:54.214
without Mia
sending them away.

15:54.265 --> 15:55.348
Perfect. See?

15:55.399 --> 15:57.267
Doesn't it feel good
to help someone?

15:57.351 --> 15:59.219
Almost...Super-good.

15:59.270 --> 16:02.439
Kind of makes you...
Super Haley.

16:02.523 --> 16:03.890
That's so dumb.

16:03.941 --> 16:06.860
Why would I include my real name
in my superhero name?

16:06.911 --> 16:08.745
Okay, see?
That's why we need you.

16:08.830 --> 16:10.113
Your power
is your brain.

16:14.068 --> 16:15.602
Mm-hmm.

16:15.670 --> 16:18.438
Okay,
I'll start the discussion.

16:18.506 --> 16:21.341
Why is Kellerman
such an asshat?

16:25.763 --> 16:29.132
Mr. Scott, as the newest member
of the Kellerman sucks club,

16:29.217 --> 16:31.601
perhaps you'd like
to field this one.

16:33.087 --> 16:35.388
I'd love to.

16:35.439 --> 16:37.607
So, today was fun,
yeah?

16:37.692 --> 16:39.726
Stop asking me that.

16:39.777 --> 16:42.312
Want to come in for dinner?
It's meat night.

16:42.396 --> 16:44.597
Uh, sorry.
I have plans.

16:44.649 --> 16:46.399
Like a date?

16:46.450 --> 16:48.235
Do you have
a girlfriend?

16:48.286 --> 16:50.937
Mm...Things are kind of
complicated right now.

16:50.988 --> 16:54.274
My dad says that's just a fancy
way of saying you're a loser.

16:54.325 --> 16:58.712
Anyway, I hope tomorrow
isn't as boring as today.

16:58.779 --> 17:01.164
Okay.
See you tomorrow.

17:01.249 --> 17:03.099
Chuck!

17:06.554 --> 17:07.837
Hate that kid.

17:14.311 --> 17:16.463
Crisis center.

17:16.531 --> 17:18.515
Young woman:
I don't know why I'm calling,

17:18.598 --> 17:21.233
but I just needed
to talk to someone.

17:21.301 --> 17:24.137
Three girls at my school
won't stop bullying me,

17:24.188 --> 17:27.107
and I don't know
how much more I can take.

17:27.157 --> 17:28.909
I'm sorry.

17:28.976 --> 17:30.476
Have you told anyone?

17:30.528 --> 17:33.613
Um, your parents
or maybe a teacher?

17:33.664 --> 17:35.148
Doesn't do any good.

17:35.199 --> 17:38.318
They used to tease me for being
a tomboy, which was bad enough.

17:38.369 --> 17:40.587
But then they found out
that I was adopted,

17:40.655 --> 17:42.672
and now they call me
little orphan tranny.

17:42.757 --> 17:45.125
It just -- they even made
a Facebook page about me.

17:45.176 --> 17:47.544
I'm so sorry.

17:47.628 --> 17:49.662
Maybe I can help.

17:49.714 --> 17:51.431
I can call the school
for you,

17:51.498 --> 17:54.067
or I can come down
and talk to these girls.

17:54.135 --> 17:56.436
Don't.
It'll just make things worse.

17:56.503 --> 17:58.572
I just needed
to talk to someone.

17:58.639 --> 17:59.973

19:10.826 --> 19:12.343
I think we can help her.

19:12.394 --> 19:14.479
Aah! Okay, we knew
you'd come around eventually.

19:14.546 --> 19:19.383
From now on,

19:39.622 --> 19:41.172
She is
a high-school student

19:41.240 --> 19:44.008
that some bullies have been

19:59.591 --> 20:02.760
It can't be easy
going from directing <i>real</i> actors

20:02.811 --> 20:04.863
to directing
someone's stoned nephew

20:04.930 --> 20:06.814
for a local commercial.

20:06.899 --> 20:10.434
Yeah, but it's still directing,
and I get to do what I love.

20:10.486 --> 20:13.571
And then I get to go home
and do what --

20:14.623 --> 20:16.074
...be with
who I really love.

20:17.743 --> 20:19.911
Speaking of,
how are things with Millie?

20:19.962 --> 20:21.713
I guess the same.

20:21.780 --> 20:24.949
She didn't stay over last night,
so...I don't know.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.952
Maybe it's better
that we're taking things slow.

20:29.388 --> 20:30.889
Have you seen
our wedding photos yet?

20:35.427 --> 20:38.229
Does that look like a girl
who wants to take things slow?

20:38.297 --> 20:40.315
Michael quit.

20:40.399 --> 20:41.799
What?

20:41.850 --> 20:44.319
He said he was doing
the job of a mannequin,

20:44.403 --> 20:46.854
and he didn't
understand the scene, anyway.

20:46.939 --> 20:49.774
What's not to get?

20:49.825 --> 20:51.776
It's all about taking
the next big step in life.

20:51.827 --> 20:53.995
I remember before I got
back together with Millie,

20:54.079 --> 20:55.330
my life felt meaningless.

20:55.414 --> 20:57.648
I was just doing the same thing
day after day,

20:57.700 --> 20:58.950
and I wasn't happy.

21:06.292 --> 21:08.943
This is awful!

21:09.011 --> 21:10.962
"I bet you her real parents
wanted a boy.

21:11.013 --> 21:12.597
That's why
she dresses like one."

21:12.664 --> 21:13.848
And look at this.

21:13.933 --> 21:15.717
"She should be an ad
for birth control."

21:15.801 --> 21:17.051
Wait a minute.

21:17.136 --> 21:20.338
They're making fun of her
because she's adopted?

21:20.389 --> 21:21.839
Peyton was adopted.

21:21.890 --> 21:23.441
And what if <i>I</i> adopt?

21:23.508 --> 21:26.444
These bitches
would make fun of my kid.

21:26.511 --> 21:28.563
Looks like they're planning
on ambushing her after school.

21:28.647 --> 21:29.647
Where?
You sure?

21:29.698 --> 21:31.149
Pretty sure.
It says right here,

21:31.200 --> 21:34.518
"ambushing tranny after school,"
and two girls click "like."

21:34.570 --> 21:35.653
Unreal.

21:35.704 --> 21:37.572
We should call the school,
you guys.

21:37.656 --> 21:40.858
Or...We could show up

21:40.909 --> 21:42.744
and let those little
evil villains know

21:42.828 --> 21:44.178
what mean really is.

21:44.246 --> 21:45.713
Hmm.

21:45.798 --> 21:47.548
The last evil villain
that you fought

21:47.633 --> 21:49.834
shot you
and put you in a coma.

21:49.885 --> 21:52.387
She's right.

21:52.471 --> 21:54.322
You survived a gunshot
and a coma.

21:54.390 --> 21:56.007
You're indestructible.

21:57.542 --> 21:58.926
Yes!
That's not --

21:59.011 --> 22:00.544
guys, I think I made a mistake
bringing this to you.

22:00.596 --> 22:01.980
Oh, relax.

22:02.047 --> 22:04.482
They're not crips.
They're kids.

22:04.549 --> 22:07.151
More specifically,
they're stuck-up little bitches

22:07.219 --> 22:08.853
who need to be dealt with.

22:08.904 --> 22:10.721
Hales,
you used to be a teacher.

22:10.773 --> 22:13.191
Did you ever let bullies
get away with this?

22:13.242 --> 22:15.393
She's right.
You used to be a teacher.

22:15.444 --> 22:17.695
I used to be
a stuck-up girl.

22:17.746 --> 22:19.747
They are no match
for us.

22:19.832 --> 22:22.000
I used to be stuck-up, too.

22:27.172 --> 22:28.956
I know
we've had our differences,

22:29.041 --> 22:30.858
but I was hoping
we could start over

22:30.926 --> 22:33.077
on a professional level,
musician to musician.

22:33.128 --> 22:34.345
You're not a musician.

22:34.413 --> 22:36.431
You're an actress
pretending to be one.

22:36.515 --> 22:39.250
My friend Peyton started this
label for real artists, okay?

22:39.301 --> 22:41.769
You haven't even
heard me sing.

22:41.854 --> 22:45.356
No, but I've heard that
whiny noise you call speaking,

22:45.424 --> 22:46.974
and that's enough
for me.

22:47.059 --> 22:50.928
Well...I think
you're an amazing musician.

22:55.317 --> 22:58.102
Damn it. She knows
how we love compliments.

23:02.791 --> 23:04.775
Do you get picked on
at school?

23:04.827 --> 23:06.611
Not really.
Did someone say I did?

23:06.678 --> 23:07.962
No.

23:08.047 --> 23:09.714
I just was talking with a girl
who gets picked on,

23:09.781 --> 23:11.132
and she seemed
kind of sad,

23:11.216 --> 23:13.451
so I wanted to know
if anyone bullied you.

23:13.519 --> 23:15.786
Not anymore.
Chuck used to, though.

23:15.838 --> 23:19.623
Yeah, that's right.
I had words with his mother.

23:19.675 --> 23:21.792
Oh, then dad showed up
in a cape, remember?

23:21.844 --> 23:23.578
Yeah, then Aunt Brooke
made capes

23:23.645 --> 23:26.064
for all the rest of the kids
at school.

23:26.131 --> 23:28.299
Dad was like a superhero
that day.

23:28.350 --> 23:31.135
And me and Chuck
have been friends ever since.

23:33.105 --> 23:34.489
Hmm.

23:34.573 --> 23:35.990
What's wrong
with being a hero?

23:36.075 --> 23:38.776
Bullies don't stop unless
somebody stands up to them.

23:38.827 --> 23:40.111
I know.
I used to <i>be</i> one.

23:40.162 --> 23:42.280
No, I get it,
but sometimes being a hero

23:42.331 --> 23:44.982
means sacrificing one cause
for the good of another.

23:45.033 --> 23:46.951
I know.

23:47.002 --> 23:50.188
I just wish I could put him
in his place for once.

23:53.492 --> 23:56.878
In business,
people make deals,

23:56.962 --> 23:59.430
but people cannot be trusted.

23:59.498 --> 24:02.833
Contracts, on the other hand,
<i>can</i> be trusted.

24:02.885 --> 24:04.769
It's as simple as that.

24:04.836 --> 24:06.337
Put it on paper,

24:06.388 --> 24:09.173
and, in a sense,
it is carved in stone.

24:09.224 --> 24:12.676
The written word is made truth.

24:12.728 --> 24:16.347
Seems Mr. Scott
disagrees with me.

24:16.398 --> 24:18.699
Please tell us all
what you were thinking

24:18.767 --> 24:22.520
so we may bask in the glorious
light of your knowledge.

24:22.571 --> 24:25.856
I just know an agency
that doesn't work like that.

24:25.908 --> 24:27.858
Oh, really?

24:27.910 --> 24:30.861
And what's the name
of this magical agency

24:30.913 --> 24:33.697
that signs clients
with hugs?

24:33.749 --> 24:36.417
The agency's name
is fortitude.

24:39.721 --> 24:41.973
Integrity.

24:42.040 --> 24:44.976
Now, that's <i>the</i> most important
part of any business --

24:45.043 --> 24:48.045
working with those who have it
and keeping your own.

24:48.096 --> 24:49.514
Look, without it,

24:49.565 --> 24:52.183
contracts aren't worth
the paper they're written on.

24:52.234 --> 24:55.069
And who are you,
besides an uninvited nuisance?

24:55.154 --> 24:58.639
My name's not important,
but the name Troy Jameson is.

24:58.707 --> 25:00.508
You know,
as a top-10 NFL pick,

25:00.576 --> 25:02.910
he signed with fortitude,
a smaller agency,

25:02.995 --> 25:05.580
because he thought
that the agents had his back.

25:05.664 --> 25:08.399
It was a personal relationship
that sealed that deal.

25:08.450 --> 25:11.669
And I'm sure
money had nothing to do with it.

25:11.736 --> 25:14.088
You must have won him over
with your smile.

25:15.874 --> 25:17.241
A-and a hug.

25:19.344 --> 25:22.263
You've all heard the phrase
"it's just business."

25:22.347 --> 25:24.915
That's because business
and personal relationships

25:24.967 --> 25:26.133
don't mix.

25:26.218 --> 25:28.803
They don't mix
because people change.

25:28.887 --> 25:32.473
Viewpoints shift.
Fortunes ebb and flow.

25:32.558 --> 25:36.427
Relationships and loyalties end.
New ones begin.

25:36.478 --> 25:38.262
I can assure you,
young man --

25:38.313 --> 25:40.431
and by "young,"
I mean "inexperienced" --

25:40.482 --> 25:42.933
that the only way
to survive in business

25:42.985 --> 25:46.437
is to keep it as such --
just business.

25:46.488 --> 25:49.323
And, again, I've only
taught this class for 20 years

25:49.408 --> 25:50.958
and written a book
about it!

25:51.043 --> 25:52.109
I-I'm sorry.

25:52.160 --> 25:54.161
I, uh,
I haven't read your book.

25:54.246 --> 25:56.581
I've just been
a little bit too busy

25:56.632 --> 25:59.116
actually working
in the business world.

25:59.167 --> 26:00.851
You know, but I do know
the difference

26:00.952 --> 26:04.055
between book theory
and real-world practice.

26:04.122 --> 26:07.892
You see, Professor,
you're <i>teaching</i> theory.

26:07.959 --> 26:09.810
I'm <i>living</i> practice.

26:09.895 --> 26:12.763
You know, I think
the bottom line here

26:12.814 --> 26:15.566
is that within the walls
of this class,

26:15.634 --> 26:17.351
your book might work,

26:17.436 --> 26:20.471
but as soon as you walk outside
into the world,

26:20.522 --> 26:24.108
you know, what really works
are honest relationships...

26:24.159 --> 26:26.060
That include hugs.

26:49.973 --> 26:51.940
Okay.

26:53.539 --> 26:55.089
Okay.

26:55.174 --> 26:56.507
Cool it, shutterbug.

26:56.575 --> 26:57.792
Where's baby mama?

26:57.877 --> 27:00.011
I don't think
that she's coming.

27:00.078 --> 27:01.245
And, you know,
to be honest,

27:01.297 --> 27:02.881
I'm kind of having
second thoughts myself.

27:02.932 --> 27:05.483
I mean, Brooke,
we're in Halloween costumes.

27:06.802 --> 27:08.469
First of all,
Brooke Davis

27:08.554 --> 27:11.389
makes top-of-the-line
superhero apparel.

27:11.440 --> 27:13.474
And secondly,
I'm b. Dazzle.

27:13.559 --> 27:14.926
Isn't that right,

27:14.977 --> 27:16.544
French-speaking
crime-fighting car?

27:16.612 --> 27:17.612
<i>Oui, madame.</i>

27:19.031 --> 27:20.365
Okay, we're really gonna do this.
Yes.

27:20.432 --> 27:22.317
If we don't,
that poor girl will suffer

27:22.401 --> 27:23.785
and we'll
have done nothing.

27:23.869 --> 27:25.153
We need to be brave
for her.

27:27.406 --> 27:29.490
They used to call me
"Whaley."

27:29.575 --> 27:32.610
"Whaley Haley."

27:33.579 --> 27:36.080
Not anymore, baby mama.

27:36.131 --> 27:37.999
Not anymore.

I could only see the tops.

29:48.097 --> 29:51.299
One of the, uh, first memories
I have of my dad

29:51.383 --> 29:52.967
is when he took me up
on a plane.

29:53.052 --> 29:54.585
You gonna tell your dad
about this?

29:54.636 --> 29:55.770
Nah.

29:55.854 --> 29:58.056
He lives out of town,
so we don't talk much.

29:58.107 --> 30:01.609
And when we do, he only likes
to hear about the cool stuff.

30:01.693 --> 30:04.479
How often
do you see him?

30:04.563 --> 30:07.315
I was supposed to see him
for a weekend last summer,

30:07.399 --> 30:09.534
but then his favorite
kid rock cover band

30:09.601 --> 30:10.902
was playing that week.

30:10.953 --> 30:12.937
Can't pass
stuff like that up.

30:12.988 --> 30:16.040
What about your mom?
You do anything fun with her?

30:16.108 --> 30:17.291
I guess.

30:17.376 --> 30:20.044
She works a lot,
so I only see her at dinner.

30:20.112 --> 30:21.629
You should come over.

30:21.713 --> 30:23.631
Can't.

30:23.715 --> 30:25.783
Besides, you should
spend the time with your mom.

30:25.834 --> 30:26.717

30:52.561 --> 30:54.278
No, she just

Why don't you just
leave me alone?

30:56.314 --> 30:57.832
'Cause you're so fun

b. Dazzle, and baby mama,

you leave this girl alone.

31:34.453 --> 31:35.653
That's not my name.

31:35.704 --> 31:37.855
Enough talk.
It's time for action.

31:37.906 --> 31:40.575
Prepare to be dazzled.

31:41.660 --> 31:42.860
Oh.

31:42.911 --> 31:44.128
Homemade liquid smoke.

31:44.196 --> 31:46.080
That was supposed to...
Spread further.

31:46.165 --> 31:50.134
Wow, tranny. You found
three bigger losers than you.

31:50.202 --> 31:51.502
Excuse me?

31:51.553 --> 31:54.555
What is it about you that
you think makes you so cool,

31:54.640 --> 31:56.591
you can tease
other people?

31:56.675 --> 31:58.009
Is it your man face?

31:58.060 --> 32:00.311
Or your chicken legs?

32:00.378 --> 32:03.347
Or maybe
your enormous feet?

32:03.398 --> 32:04.649
Hey!

32:04.716 --> 32:05.933
Sorry.

32:06.001 --> 32:07.551
Don't even get me started
on your ratty hair,

32:07.603 --> 32:10.938
your bad lip gloss,
and your fake Louis Vuitton.

32:11.023 --> 32:12.523

aren't here.

32:19.998 --> 32:22.533

my name?

32:22.584 --> 32:24.118
It's one
of her superpowers.

32:24.203 --> 32:26.504
It all started
when a giant asteroid hit --

32:26.571 --> 32:28.706
Nikki, you --
you were picked on

32:28.757 --> 32:31.209
all freshman year of High School
for being the new girl.

32:31.260 --> 32:32.910
Guess you found
somebody else to tease

32:32.961 --> 32:34.795
so they'd leave you alone.

32:34.880 --> 32:37.348
Smart girl like you,
applying to Princeton --

32:37.415 --> 32:39.850
tsk-tsk --
really should know better.

32:39.918 --> 32:41.585
Maybe I'll call the Dean.

32:41.637 --> 32:43.638
Like the Dean of Princeton

32:43.722 --> 32:46.807
would listen
to some wack job in a cape.

32:46.892 --> 32:49.527
Well, since you,
Rachel, and Audrey

32:49.594 --> 32:53.030
all need clean records
to get those scholarships,

32:53.098 --> 32:55.566
I wouldn't want
some <i>crazy</i> wack job

32:55.617 --> 32:58.102
saying anything
if I were...

32:58.153 --> 33:00.705
You.

33:00.772 --> 33:03.991
Besides,
we're <i>all</i> a little crazy.

33:04.076 --> 33:05.409
Mm-hmm.

33:05.460 --> 33:08.612
And you never know
when we're just gonna pop up.

33:08.664 --> 33:13.217
You open up that locker --
crazy girl inside.

33:13.285 --> 33:15.286
You go to sleep at night,
guess who's underneath that bed.

33:15.337 --> 33:17.054
Crazy girl!

33:17.122 --> 33:19.173
You get in the back seat
of that car, guess who's there!

33:19.258 --> 33:20.457
Crazy girl!!

33:20.509 --> 33:21.976
They got it.

33:22.060 --> 33:23.678
I'm shutterbug.

33:23.762 --> 33:24.962
Yes, you are.

33:25.013 --> 33:27.565
Fine. We're leaving.

33:27.632 --> 33:29.016
Good.

33:29.101 --> 33:32.687
But in case you want to fight
again, we'll be ready for you!

33:32.771 --> 33:34.855
And you all
take down that website,

33:34.940 --> 33:38.159
or I'll post your photos,
and they're all from bad angles.

33:38.243 --> 33:39.493
Bad.

33:40.996 --> 33:42.747
It's not like
we can beat them up.

33:42.814 --> 33:44.398
I think
one of them is pregnant.

33:44.466 --> 33:46.584
Shield.

33:47.703 --> 33:48.703
How did you know
their names?

33:48.787 --> 33:51.539
Well...
I was a teacher,

33:51.623 --> 33:53.541
and I still have some friends
at the school.

33:53.625 --> 33:55.209
You're like
a mastermind.

33:55.294 --> 33:57.211
I <i>am</i> a mastermind.
That's more like it.

33:58.347 --> 34:00.464
Hey.

34:00.515 --> 34:03.351
Mrs. Scott?
What are you doing here?

34:03.435 --> 34:06.354
I am here to tell you
that things will get better

34:06.438 --> 34:08.672
and that High School
is full of insecure kids

34:08.724 --> 34:11.141
who are just gonna
make fun of you for no reason.

34:11.193 --> 34:14.027
They used to make fun of me for
being smart and dressing weird.

34:15.647 --> 34:17.815
This --
I get it.

34:17.866 --> 34:21.034
Listen, the thing is,
no matter how different you are,

34:21.119 --> 34:23.571
you'll always find someone
who accepts you.

34:23.655 --> 34:24.789
It's true.

34:26.958 --> 34:29.627
Are you gonna be okay?

34:29.694 --> 34:31.712
I think so.

34:31.797 --> 34:33.797
Can I ask you guys
for a favor?

34:35.333 --> 34:36.699
Sure.

34:39.254 --> 34:41.839
So, <i>i</i> can't be the hero,
but <i>you</i> can, huh?

34:41.889 --> 34:43.540
Wow.
You are learning.

34:43.592 --> 34:45.141
You know,
you're not nearly as dumb

34:45.210 --> 34:46.543
as Kellerman
thinks you are.

34:46.594 --> 34:49.545
And besides, he can make fun
of you all he wants,

34:49.598 --> 34:51.232
but leave fortitude
alone.

34:51.315 --> 34:53.434
Well, I have a feeling
there's gonna be some backlash,

34:53.518 --> 34:55.052
but it was worth it.

34:55.103 --> 34:56.137
Thanks.

34:56.204 --> 34:57.605
No problem.

34:57.672 --> 34:59.724

all the heroes it can get.

Uh...Yeah.

35:32.496 --> 35:34.797
I had fun.

35:35.891 --> 35:39.360

You're my bartender.

I'm <i>your</i> pilot.

35:47.536 --> 35:49.037

pretty important, doesn't it?

35:52.791 --> 35:55.860
Hey, uh, can I still
join you for dinner?

35:55.911 --> 35:56.861
Definitely.

35:56.912 --> 35:58.362
Chase!

35:59.748 --> 36:02.917
Yeah.
You just got big-brothered.

36:05.471 --> 36:08.523
So, you still want to hear
what I think?

36:08.591 --> 36:09.858
I don't know.

36:09.925 --> 36:12.010
Is it still "you suck"?

36:12.061 --> 36:14.095
As a person, yes.

36:14.180 --> 36:17.215
But...

36:17.266 --> 36:20.151
As a musician,
you are surprisingly good.

36:20.219 --> 36:22.887
That really means a lot
coming from you.

36:22.955 --> 36:27.692
You know, Peyton and Haley
gave me the chance to sing.

36:27.743 --> 36:30.161
But lately,
I haven't been singing.

36:30.229 --> 36:32.413

Fighting with you

36:32.498 --> 36:34.048

36:34.116 --> 36:35.283
I'm sorry.

36:35.367 --> 36:38.236
It's not your fault.

every time I sing.

And I love it,
and I need to get back to it.

36:57.139 --> 37:00.424

you're taking my studio time?

37:00.476 --> 37:02.026
No.

I wasn't thinking, "I'm back

I was thinking,
"I can't wait to tell Millie."
