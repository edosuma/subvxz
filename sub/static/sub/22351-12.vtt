00:01.990 --> 00:05.990
>> Announcer: Previously on "big
brother" -- the 6th sense

00:05.990 --> 00:06.990
power alliance was running the
house.

00:06.990 --> 00:10.990
And they planned to protect the
twins.

00:10.990 --> 00:12.990
>> We have to survive five
weeks.

00:12.990 --> 00:14.000
>> Then what?

00:14.000 --> 00:17.990
>> After Jeff brought up his
suspicions to Austin --

00:17.990 --> 00:22.540
>> if Jeff is going to keep
pressing this Liz and Julia

00:22.540 --> 00:25.990
thing it's making him a bigger
target in my mind.

00:25.990 --> 00:29.990
>> They put a pit stop on the
block.

00:29.990 --> 00:33.990
>> Austin develops feelings for
one of the twins have any have a

00:33.990 --> 00:35.000
strong connection with Liz.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.990
>> But when Jeff had an
undercover meeting with Liz --

00:38.990 --> 00:41.990
>> I know more about you than
you think --

00:41.990 --> 00:45.990
>> he blew his stack.

00:45.990 --> 00:48.990
>> Why were you under the covers
together?

00:48.990 --> 00:56.990
>> At the live eviction, by a
vote of 7-4, Jeff, you are

00:56.990 --> 00:58.410
evicted from the "Big Brother"
house.

00:58.410 --> 01:01.990
>> The salesman hit the door.

01:01.990 --> 01:07.990
At a 90s head of household
competition, the 6th sense

01:07.990 --> 01:08.990
remained in power.

01:08.990 --> 01:12.950
>> Julie: Congratulations to
Liz and Shelli, you two ladies

01:12.950 --> 01:15.990
are the new heads of household!

01:15.990 --> 01:18.990
>> Announcer: Tonight, four
houseguests will be nominated

01:18.990 --> 01:23.950
and 90s week continues with a
grunge inspired battle of the

01:23.950 --> 01:29.990
block, all of this right now on
"Big Brother"!

01:29.990 --> 01:39.990
>> Oh, no, it's Steve again!

01:39.990 --> 01:59.990
>> Oh, no, it's Steve again!

01:59.990 --> 02:08.990
>> Oh, no, it's Steve again!

02:08.990 --> 02:10.990
>> Girl power in the house, yet

02:10.990 --> 02:11.830
again!

02:11.830 --> 02:11.990
Nice.

02:11.990 --> 02:13.990
>> Oh, my God.

02:13.990 --> 02:16.990
>> This is so amazing, being
double hoh with Liz.

02:16.990 --> 02:19.830
We are in the 6th sense
together.

02:19.830 --> 02:20.990
We are up in the big room.

02:20.990 --> 02:25.990
I mean, we are doing awesome and
sitting pretty for another week.

02:25.990 --> 02:27.990
>> I'm so excited.

02:27.990 --> 02:31.990
>> Here, Liz.

02:31.990 --> 02:32.990
It's hilarious.

02:32.990 --> 02:36.990
>> That was so awesome.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.990
>> I am thrilled to be the new
head of household!

02:39.990 --> 02:44.990
I know that I'm not going home
this week since Shelli and I are

02:44.990 --> 02:47.990
pretty close and that means
Julia and Liz and we just have

02:47.990 --> 02:51.990
to make it through a few more
evictions to play in the house

02:51.990 --> 02:52.990
together.

02:52.990 --> 02:54.830
The twin team is moving on up.

02:54.830 --> 02:55.990
>> Oh, girl power.

02:55.990 --> 02:57.990
More girl power.

02:57.990 --> 03:02.990
>> This is the most beautiful
come backing ever!

03:02.990 --> 03:06.700
Two weeks ago, no one even
wanted to be in the same room

03:06.700 --> 03:09.990
with me and now I have two
people that are in complete

03:09.990 --> 03:12.990
control of the whole house and
as far as I know, they are not

03:12.990 --> 03:13.990
gunning for me.

03:13.990 --> 03:20.990
I don't know what happened, but
it's working!

03:20.990 --> 03:23.990
>> I'm feeling a little alone
right now.

03:23.990 --> 03:26.990
It's going to be really hard
picking up the pieces.

03:26.990 --> 03:30.830
My number one concern is that
I'm not associated by his

03:30.830 --> 03:33.540
actions when leaving the house
and hoping that I won't become a

03:33.540 --> 03:34.990
target because of it.

03:34.990 --> 03:36.540
>> Oh, man!

03:36.540 --> 03:48.410
>>
>> I love you so much.

03:48.410 --> 03:49.990
I'm going to kill it.

03:49.990 --> 03:50.990
Yes!

03:50.990 --> 04:00.990
>> I am so excited!

04:00.990 --> 04:05.290
I just literally imagine myself
winning and like I'm going to

04:05.290 --> 04:05.990
win, I'm going to win.

04:05.990 --> 04:07.990
>> Tomorrow not today ok.

04:07.990 --> 04:11.990
>> I'm so excited because all of
these people have been talking

04:11.990 --> 04:12.990
about me all week.

04:12.990 --> 04:18.990
Hadha, ha, in your faces.

04:18.990 --> 04:20.990
>> I vote to evict James.

04:20.990 --> 04:21.700
>> James.

04:21.700 --> 04:21.990
>> James.

04:21.990 --> 04:24.990
>> James.

04:24.990 --> 04:29.290
>> Jeff received four votes this
week and almost split the house.

04:29.290 --> 04:32.990
There's some very shady stuff
going on with the votes this

04:32.990 --> 04:33.990
week.

04:33.990 --> 04:39.000
Somebody lied directly to my
face.

04:39.000 --> 04:49.990
>> Johnny mack and Becky voted
the other way.

04:49.990 --> 04:50.990
They're a threesome now.

04:50.990 --> 04:54.990
>> I voted to evict James over
Jeff.

04:54.990 --> 04:58.990
I know it went completely
against what my alliance

04:58.990 --> 05:01.830
instilled in me but I never made
a connection with James.

05:01.830 --> 05:05.700
Jeff and I, we had a great
connection so I'm 100% going to

05:05.700 --> 05:06.990
keep it a secret.

05:06.990 --> 05:10.290
They won't find out until
they're evicted and that's just

05:10.290 --> 05:17.990
too bad.

05:17.990 --> 05:20.700
>> I get to play next week.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.990
>> You don't want to be a
threat.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.830
>> It's good, it's good.

05:24.830 --> 05:27.990
I was just worried.

05:27.990 --> 05:31.990
>> It was so easy.

05:31.990 --> 05:32.990
Now I'm doubting him.

05:32.990 --> 05:34.290
He's the smartest person.

05:34.290 --> 05:35.990
He does music for a living.

05:35.990 --> 05:37.540
>> I know.

05:37.540 --> 05:47.990
>> Oh, my God, ok.

05:47.990 --> 05:53.990
>> I should have gotten the
first question.

05:53.990 --> 05:57.120
I screwed up.

06:19.990 --> 06:24.290
>> Oh, well, Jason is screwed
again.

06:24.290 --> 06:26.990
It's so annoying, I wish
somebody else would --

06:26.990 --> 06:29.990
>> you don't get nominated
and --

06:29.990 --> 06:33.990
>> back door, of course is that
scary but it's also so stupid

06:33.990 --> 06:36.950
why everyone nominates me every
time.

06:36.950 --> 06:42.990
They're afraid to make a move on
a target so let's just keep

06:42.990 --> 06:43.990
throwing the same people up.

06:43.990 --> 06:46.410
>> I'm really alone in the game.

06:46.410 --> 06:49.830
I'm afraid to be a nominee
because they keep throwing me up

06:49.830 --> 06:53.990
there knowing you're not going
to get anyone mad if I'm going

06:53.990 --> 06:54.990
home.

06:54.990 --> 06:56.990
No one is going to fight and
defend me and it's easy to see.

06:56.990 --> 06:59.990
>> She will come after me
probably because I have been

06:59.990 --> 07:02.990
talking about the twin thing.

07:02.990 --> 07:03.990
You ain't heard about this?

07:03.990 --> 07:07.990
>> About the rumor about an
alternating twin?

07:07.990 --> 07:10.990
>> Uh-huh.

07:10.990 --> 07:23.990
>>
>> hey, poopy-head.

07:23.990 --> 07:25.700
>> Good morning.

07:25.700 --> 07:25.990
I tried.

07:25.990 --> 07:28.990
>> I know.

07:28.990 --> 07:29.990
Attention to detail comp.

07:29.990 --> 07:33.990
You will get the endurance one.

07:33.990 --> 07:34.990
Was it you?

07:34.990 --> 07:47.990
Just had to check.

07:47.990 --> 07:52.990
>> Who wants to see our hoh
room?

07:52.990 --> 07:54.990
>> We want to see it!

07:54.990 --> 08:01.950
>> I am so, so psyched to head
upstairs to my new hoh room

08:01.950 --> 08:05.120
but at the same time I am just
so nervous I'm going to keep a

08:05.120 --> 08:08.990
close eye out on Jason and
Johnny mack because they're

08:08.990 --> 08:10.990
looking really hard into the
twin thing.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.990
I have no idea what to expect.

08:12.990 --> 08:24.990
>> Go, Liz.

08:24.990 --> 08:27.120
>>
>> you're so cute.

08:33.990 --> 08:36.990
>> It's so you.

08:36.990 --> 08:41.000
>> I have a theory one of the
twins has a crown number nine

08:41.000 --> 08:42.990
tooth and the other one doesn't.

08:42.990 --> 08:47.990
Looking at Liz's hoh photos
and the one, Liz doesn't have

08:47.990 --> 08:49.000
number nine in yet.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.990
I'm thinking very clever Liz and
family.

08:51.990 --> 09:01.120
You're hiding it very well.

09:01.120 --> 09:03.990
>> Hi, mom.

09:03.990 --> 09:04.540
My beautiful human.

09:04.540 --> 09:05.990
I miss you.

09:05.990 --> 09:08.990
Just wanted to send you a little
whoop and a big hug.

09:08.990 --> 09:12.830
>> I'm happy that you are having
a great adventure.

09:12.830 --> 09:17.990
I am happy that you are mine --
wait.

09:17.990 --> 09:19.990
Oh, love rango.

09:19.990 --> 09:21.990
>> Oh, my baby.

09:21.990 --> 09:25.120
I love you, rango.

09:25.120 --> 09:28.290
>> Shelli's letter is written by
her dog.

09:28.290 --> 09:31.990
Honestly the letter is probably
more intelligently composed than

09:31.990 --> 09:36.990
a letter that Clay could write.

09:36.990 --> 09:40.990
>> My darling Liz, this is the
hardest and most troubling task

09:40.990 --> 09:45.990
of my life to not be able to see
you, talk to you, listen to your

09:45.990 --> 09:48.990
stories, laugh with you, all of
this suddenly removed from me.

09:48.990 --> 09:51.990
Please do not cry when you read
this letter.

09:51.990 --> 09:54.990
Remember, you are an ugly cryer.

09:54.990 --> 09:56.990
>> That was so awesome.

09:56.990 --> 09:58.990
>> Love mom.

09:58.990 --> 10:05.990
>> And I'm just saying to myself
this letter is lacking heart

10:05.990 --> 10:08.990
felt emotion content directed at
one person.

10:08.990 --> 10:12.540
It just seems like it could have
easily been written to two

10:12.540 --> 10:13.990
people that are kind of similar.

10:13.990 --> 10:20.990
It's just supporting the twin
theory even more.

10:20.990 --> 10:23.990
>> Do, everyone.

10:23.990 --> 10:24.950
It's time.

10:24.950 --> 10:35.990
>> James, Liz, Austin, dusty.

10:35.990 --> 10:37.990
>> Ok.

10:37.990 --> 10:41.990
>> I wake up in the morning and
think to myself, is this real?

10:41.990 --> 10:43.990
Is it real?

10:43.990 --> 10:47.990
I'm in the Big Brother house, I
can't believe that this is real,

10:47.990 --> 10:49.990
is this really real ♪
♪?

10:49.990 --> 10:50.990
>> Yes.

10:50.990 --> 10:52.290
This is really.

10:52.290 --> 10:53.410
>> Is it real?

10:53.410 --> 10:54.990
I think it's real.

10:54.990 --> 10:58.830
>> I don't know if this is real
but I know one thing that is

10:58.830 --> 11:03.990
real and it's this hot dog
sandwich in this guy's belly.

11:03.990 --> 11:08.990

11:08.990 --> 11:10.990

11:22.990 --> 11:30.990
>> Good job.

11:30.990 --> 11:33.290
>> I'm so nervous, I have never
done that.

11:33.290 --> 11:34.990
>> You will be great.

11:34.990 --> 11:35.990
>> How do you feel?

11:35.990 --> 11:39.290
>> Freaked out because I had no
idea what to do.

11:39.290 --> 11:41.990
>> They know that you're a twin.

11:41.990 --> 11:43.990
They know that this gives you
one more week and that they

11:43.990 --> 11:49.990
don't know what the twin twist
is so that scares them.

11:49.990 --> 11:52.990
>>
>> that's just going to make you

11:52.990 --> 11:55.830
more of a target next week so we
need to protect you to get you

11:55.830 --> 11:55.990
through that.

11:55.990 --> 11:56.990
>> I see who it is.

11:56.990 --> 11:57.990
It is Clay.

11:57.990 --> 11:59.990
>> Clay, what are your thoughts.

11:59.990 --> 12:01.990
>> Clay's thoughts.

12:01.990 --> 12:06.990
>> Let's protect these two man.

12:06.990 --> 12:10.990
>> I think we have to get out
somebody that would go against

12:10.990 --> 12:11.990
us this week.

12:11.990 --> 12:14.990
>> I worry about Jason coming
after Liz.

12:14.990 --> 12:17.410
>> Jason?

12:17.410 --> 12:18.990
>> Jason, Meg.

12:18.990 --> 12:22.990
>> Or James?

12:22.990 --> 12:25.990
>> I think Jason would be best
option because you know he would

12:25.990 --> 12:27.410
come after this group.

12:27.410 --> 12:33.990
And you can have two more who
less likely affect our game but

12:33.990 --> 12:35.990
if they go home it's still a
win.

12:35.990 --> 12:39.000
>> It's all about the 6th
sense alliance we have worked

12:39.000 --> 12:43.990
together to day our da' and
Jeff.

12:43.990 --> 12:47.990
And now we need another target
for someone that is going to

12:47.990 --> 12:49.410
come after us.

12:49.410 --> 12:51.990
Somebody big ask we have too
take them out now.

12:51.990 --> 12:54.990
>> Jackie, nothing against her
but --

12:54.990 --> 12:56.990
>> I just see right through
her.

12:56.990 --> 12:59.990
I think I'm going to put her up
and I need someone else.

12:59.990 --> 13:03.990
What if I put her between Audrey
and Jackie?

13:03.990 --> 13:06.000
>> I think Audrey could still be
number two us.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.990
>> Audrey is a target for them.

13:07.990 --> 13:10.990
>> Audrey has to be a back door
situation.

13:10.990 --> 13:14.990
>> It's at that point that if
again she gets saved and not

13:14.990 --> 13:17.990
back doored people are going to
start connecting the dots and

13:17.990 --> 13:20.990
recognizing wait, Shelli did
that, Vanessa did that --

13:20.990 --> 13:26.990
>> this extra vote, the fourth
vote, it's being speculated.

13:26.990 --> 13:34.990
I think it's Becky.

13:34.990 --> 13:36.990
>> A lot of things to think
about.

13:55.990 --> 13:58.990
>> Ok.

14:14.990 --> 14:17.120
>> I was going to wait to catch
up with you.

14:17.120 --> 14:19.830
A lot has gone on.

14:19.830 --> 14:21.990
I just literally put my game on
hold, like done.

14:21.990 --> 14:25.990
>> Now you have like a new lease
on life because you're totally

14:25.990 --> 14:27.700
separated from him.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.990
>> So I don't wanted to make it
clear with Austin, even though

14:29.990 --> 14:33.990
him and Jeff didn't get along
well, it doesn't mean Austin and

14:33.990 --> 14:37.000
I glnt whatever happened with
him isn't associated with me.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.990
>> Not for me.

14:38.990 --> 14:41.120
>> We're completely different.

14:41.120 --> 14:43.990
>> But do you know what is going
on, what you would want to do.

14:43.990 --> 14:45.990
>> I don't know.

14:45.990 --> 14:51.990
Because this was -- the whole
Jeff thing came off guard and

14:51.990 --> 14:53.830
originally everything was
Audrey, Audrey.

14:53.830 --> 14:55.990
I don't see why they would go
after you.

14:55.990 --> 14:59.990
I could see you be used as a
pawn but you're not going

14:59.990 --> 15:00.990
anywhere.

15:00.990 --> 15:01.410
I'm on your side.

15:01.410 --> 15:02.990
I am.

15:02.990 --> 15:07.540
>> Now that Jeff is gone Jackie
seems to be a free agent in her

15:07.540 --> 15:08.830
house.

15:08.830 --> 15:11.990
If I can get in her head perhaps
I have a new working

15:11.990 --> 15:14.990
relationship in the house that I
didn't think was possible while

15:14.990 --> 15:15.990
Jeff was here.

15:15.990 --> 15:17.990
>> I like you could sow I don't
want you to go.

15:17.990 --> 15:20.990
>> I don't foresee that but you
never know.

15:20.990 --> 15:22.990
>> But he did have a fight with
the hoh.

15:22.990 --> 15:23.990
>> Exactly.

15:23.990 --> 15:26.990
>> It seems like Austin is
trying to have my back in the

15:26.990 --> 15:29.990
game but at the same time he's
trying to scare me a little bit

15:29.990 --> 15:32.990
and pointing out I may be going
up as a pawn.

15:32.990 --> 15:35.990
I don't know what kind of game
he is trying to play with me.

15:35.990 --> 15:42.990
>> I guess I will go finish
working out.

15:42.990 --> 15:43.700
>> Good talk.

15:43.700 --> 15:44.990
>> Just catching up.

15:44.990 --> 15:46.990
>> Exact apply.

15:48.990 --> 15:53.000
>> I think that you and I kind
of play a similar game in a

15:53.000 --> 15:56.990
sense that we're here to watch
and of course quieter, you know,

15:56.990 --> 15:57.990
just listen --
>> yeah.

15:57.990 --> 16:01.990
>> So we can use that ammo for
later.

16:01.990 --> 16:03.990
>> I just want to protect
myself for now.

16:03.990 --> 16:07.990
>> As far as I'm concerned
you're totally golden.

16:07.990 --> 16:16.540
>> I think Liz is --
>> he just came to me right now

16:16.540 --> 16:19.990
and said I think Liz is going to
put you up as a pawn, you should

16:19.990 --> 16:21.120
go talk to her.

16:21.120 --> 16:24.540
>> I'm telling Shelli about
Austin because I'm not sure what

16:24.540 --> 16:27.540
kind of game he is trying to
play with me.

16:27.540 --> 16:30.830
Shelli since she is hoh I want
to make sure that she will keep

16:30.830 --> 16:31.120
me safe this week.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.990
>> It's really weird.

16:33.990 --> 16:34.990
We have not confirmed anything.

16:34.990 --> 16:36.540
We have not spoken with anybody.

16:36.540 --> 16:39.990
>> What the heck Austin you
could have told us that you were

16:39.990 --> 16:41.990
going to go tell Jackie.

16:41.990 --> 16:43.990
You have to run stuff by us.

16:43.990 --> 16:44.990
You're starting to worry me man.

16:44.990 --> 16:47.410
>> She would have put me up.

16:47.410 --> 16:48.990
We have never talked game.

16:48.990 --> 16:56.000
>> Then again --
>> I'm not sure about Austin

16:56.000 --> 16:56.990
keeping me on.

16:56.990 --> 17:06.990
>> I don't know about Austin.

17:06.990 --> 17:12.990
>> I don't know about Austin.

17:12.990 --> 17:13.990
All right. Darling.

17:13.990 --> 17:17.290
We have some great info for you.

17:17.290 --> 17:20.990
Any time that I get information
that I find to be important

17:20.990 --> 17:23.990
you're the first person that I
want to talk to.

17:23.990 --> 17:25.830
I to jacky.

17:25.830 --> 17:28.700
Basically what I'm about to tell
you is that we have to be very,

17:28.700 --> 17:30.990
very careful about Austin.

17:30.990 --> 17:33.990
Jackie goes yeah, you know
because Austin just came

17:33.990 --> 17:35.990
downstairs and pulled me aside
and he warned me.

17:35.990 --> 17:40.540
He said, you know, I think Liz
might be putting you up.

17:40.540 --> 17:43.990
So you might want to be careful,
you might want to talk to Liz.

17:43.990 --> 17:49.290
And I don't think that he knows
a lot about how to put pieces of

17:49.290 --> 17:53.410
information together, and I felt
that anything said in that

17:53.410 --> 17:55.990
conversation might filter back
around through the house like it

17:55.990 --> 17:57.120
always tends to.

17:57.120 --> 18:00.990
>> Your point is that you're
beginning to wonder about

18:00.990 --> 18:01.990
Austin.

18:01.990 --> 18:04.990
>> I have had moments where he
has done things that made me

18:04.990 --> 18:05.990
wonder too.

18:05.990 --> 18:07.990
>> Jackie was expressing concern
to me about Austin.

18:07.990 --> 18:13.410
>> But the point is, he should
have said is it ok if I do

18:13.410 --> 18:14.990
this -- that should be out in
the open.

18:14.990 --> 18:19.290
>> I think we need to be so
careful when we're in this room

18:19.290 --> 18:23.950
that we're having conversations
when Austin is in the room.

18:23.950 --> 18:25.990
We can't vocalize as much
information because I don't

18:25.990 --> 18:27.700
trust him.

18:27.700 --> 18:31.000
>> I have known Austin can be an
emotional player but he should

18:31.000 --> 18:34.990
have come to the group first and
made sure that was do before

18:34.990 --> 18:35.410
going rogue.

18:35.410 --> 18:37.990
>> Who am I going to put up?

18:42.540 --> 18:43.990
>> Ok.

18:43.990 --> 18:48.990
The targets are basically Jackie
and Becky so if you want to put

18:48.990 --> 18:49.990
up Jackie with James.

18:49.990 --> 18:50.990
>> Or Steve.

18:50.990 --> 18:54.990
>> Or Steve so that if one of
them comes down Becky goes up.

18:54.990 --> 18:57.990
I'm a little bit worried about
being three throned this week

18:57.990 --> 19:01.990
and that means Liz would not be
hoh which means that Austin

19:01.990 --> 19:03.990
will be running her game.

19:03.990 --> 19:05.990
I'm not sure where his head is.

19:05.990 --> 19:07.990
I would like to stay in charge
to make sure that things go

19:07.990 --> 19:09.990
pretty smooth this week.

19:09.990 --> 19:13.830
>> So our number one sole
purpose?

19:13.830 --> 19:16.120
>> How do you feel if we put up
Jason?

19:16.120 --> 19:18.990
>> Jason and Johnny mack.

19:18.990 --> 19:22.540
>> Here is my concern, because
we're telling other people what

19:22.540 --> 19:22.990
he has done.

19:22.990 --> 19:24.990
>> I don't want to put Johnny
mack up.

19:24.990 --> 19:27.990
>> I don't know what to do.

19:27.990 --> 19:31.990
>> You put up Johnny mack.

19:31.990 --> 19:35.990
If you want to go all out and
put up Steve and Jason and let

19:35.990 --> 19:38.990
them battle it out, that's less
stress, you can do that, let

19:38.990 --> 19:42.540
them Duke it out, whoever wins,
wins.

19:42.540 --> 19:43.540
Whatever.

19:43.540 --> 19:44.990
>> Jason I need you to go
downstairs and have a

19:44.990 --> 19:47.990
conversation with Johnny mack
because it the least of amount

19:47.990 --> 19:53.990
of blood on I had hands and I
don't want to put up another

19:53.990 --> 19:54.990
target.

19:54.990 --> 19:56.830
>> Oh, my gosh.

19:56.830 --> 19:57.000
Hi, lady girl.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.990
>> Can I talk to you for a
second?

19:59.990 --> 20:09.990
>> Oh, yeah.

20:09.990 --> 20:13.990
>> You know Johnny mack is not
the target.

20:13.990 --> 20:15.990
>> Never.

20:15.990 --> 20:17.990
>> Ok.

20:17.990 --> 20:22.990
Where are we at now?

20:22.990 --> 20:29.990
>> Obviously me and Shelli trust
you.

20:29.990 --> 20:35.120
How would you feel if you went
up?

20:35.120 --> 20:36.990
>> Seriously, buddy?

20:36.990 --> 20:40.990
Why do I have to to keep
cleaning up after you.

20:40.990 --> 20:44.990
>> Are we allowed to win it.

20:44.990 --> 20:48.990
>> We want Jason gofnlt I hate
asking you to throw stuff.

20:48.990 --> 20:52.290
>> If you hate asking me, just
put someone else up.

20:52.290 --> 20:54.000
>> You don't have to do it.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.700
It suction because we don't know
who to put up and Shelli is

20:58.700 --> 21:01.990
freaking out because she doesn't
want blood on her hands.

21:01.990 --> 21:02.990
Can you do it?

21:02.990 --> 21:07.120
>> I have to make up my mind
whether I'm going to throw it or

21:07.120 --> 21:08.540
not.

21:08.540 --> 21:11.540
>> I think four times but at
what point do I start out

21:11.540 --> 21:14.540
playing everyone else's game and
start playing my own:

21:23.990 --> 21:25.990
>> What are you going to do.

21:25.990 --> 21:26.990
>> You have to do something
justifiable.

21:26.990 --> 21:29.990
>> You could just put up two
people that you would feel

21:29.990 --> 21:31.540
comfortable going home.

21:31.540 --> 21:34.990
If you're going to target
someone you need to target

21:34.990 --> 21:36.990
someone that is throwing your
name out there.

21:36.990 --> 21:40.700
>> Who else do you know that
would throw my name out?

21:40.700 --> 21:41.990
>> Jason.

21:41.990 --> 21:43.990
That's the only person I know.

21:43.990 --> 21:44.950
>> Jason.

21:44.950 --> 21:46.290
Is that what you're saying.

21:46.290 --> 21:51.540
>> Jason is a major threat to my
game and if there's anything I

21:51.540 --> 21:56.990
can do this week to get him out
of the house, you bet I'm going

21:56.990 --> 21:57.540
to do it.

21:57.540 --> 21:59.990
>> Jason is acting very like
scared.

21:59.990 --> 22:00.990
The look in his face.

22:00.990 --> 22:04.990
>> Oh, yeah, he is petrified.

22:04.990 --> 22:08.990
He is like, yeah, I'm going
home.

22:08.990 --> 22:13.990
>> That makes it easier.

22:17.990 --> 22:21.990
>> Our responsibility as the
heads of household is to

22:21.990 --> 22:25.990
nominate two people for
eviction.

22:25.990 --> 22:29.990
Going into this nomination
ceremony I am expecting to be

22:29.990 --> 22:31.410
nominated.

22:31.410 --> 22:33.990
The only week I haven't been
nominated in this game was when

22:33.990 --> 22:35.990
I was hoh myself.

22:35.990 --> 22:40.990
I'm just expect being that
either Liz or Shelli make it a

22:40.990 --> 22:43.990
full trifecta.

22:43.990 --> 22:49.000
>> I'm a little nervous.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.990
Just got evicted and started
trouble in the house.

22:53.990 --> 22:57.990
Hopefully that doesn't trickle
down to me where I could be

22:57.990 --> 22:58.990
going on the block.

22:58.990 --> 23:08.990
>> Time for the nomination
ceremony.

23:08.990 --> 23:17.830
>> Time for the nomination
ceremony.

23:17.830 --> 23:20.990
>> This is the nomination
ceremony.

23:20.990 --> 23:23.990
It is our responsibility as the
heads of household to each

23:23.990 --> 23:27.700
nominate two houseguests for
eviction.

23:27.700 --> 23:30.990
I will reveal my nominations
first.

23:30.990 --> 23:42.000
The first houseguest I have
nominated is ...

23:42.000 --> 23:55.540
The next houseguest I have
nominated is ...

23:55.540 --> 24:00.990
>> I have nominated you James
and you Jackie.

24:00.990 --> 24:03.990
I haven't played a close
connection with you as I have

24:03.990 --> 24:06.990
with other houseguests and I
don't know where your head is at

24:06.990 --> 24:07.990
in this game.

24:07.990 --> 24:14.950
I wish you both the best of
luck.

24:14.950 --> 24:28.120
>> The first houseguest I have
nominated is ...

24:28.120 --> 24:38.290
The second houseguest I have
nominated is ... I have

24:38.290 --> 24:44.950
the second houseguest I have
nominated is ... I have

24:44.950 --> 24:50.700
nominated you Jason and you John
simply because my pool of people

24:50.700 --> 24:53.120
is very, very small as to who to
put up.

24:53.120 --> 24:54.990
John I have already put you up.

24:54.990 --> 24:57.990
That's why you're up again.

24:57.990 --> 25:01.990
Jason, I have been told that you
would essentially come after me

25:01.990 --> 25:02.990
so therefore I'm putting you up.

25:02.990 --> 25:05.990
If that is not true Jason I'm
giving you every opportunity to

25:05.990 --> 25:09.990
talk to me about that and know
that you are a hard fighter and

25:09.990 --> 25:13.990
I know you can get yourself off
the block, dethrone me if you

25:13.990 --> 25:17.700
have to because I don't want to
have to be doing this at all.

25:17.700 --> 25:31.990
>> S this nomination ceremony
is adjourned.

25:31.990 --> 25:36.540
>> So now I have been nominated
four out of four times.

25:36.540 --> 25:37.990
This 1 amazing.

25:37.990 --> 25:38.990
I'm really good at this.

25:38.990 --> 25:45.120
Like if the game was called "get
nominated" I would be winning

25:45.120 --> 25:45.990
right now.

25:45.990 --> 25:48.990
>> This makes me feel so angry.

25:48.990 --> 25:54.950
There is absolutely no proof
that I will go after Shelli and

25:54.950 --> 25:54.990
Clay.

25:54.990 --> 25:58.990
I have simply been lied on.

25:58.990 --> 26:03.990
>> Being nominated two weeks in
a row is definitely a hard pill

26:03.990 --> 26:07.990
to swallow but if they keep
putting me up on the block they

26:07.990 --> 26:10.700
will see I'm not to be played
with and I will come back after

26:10.700 --> 26:15.990
them.

26:15.990 --> 26:16.990
>> Sorry.

26:16.990 --> 26:18.290
I know it's hard.

26:18.290 --> 26:19.120
I feel bad.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.990
I'm like -- I know it's hard.

26:20.990 --> 26:21.990
>> It's really hard.

26:21.990 --> 26:22.990
>> It's ok.

26:22.990 --> 26:26.700
>> I'm not sure where Liz's head
is at but it might be partially

26:26.700 --> 26:29.000
my fault because I haven't
really talked game with her.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.990
>> So I want you to know that
you are absolutely not my

26:32.990 --> 26:33.990
target.

26:33.990 --> 26:34.990
>> So I will be safe this week.

26:34.990 --> 26:36.990
>> You will be safe this week
for sure.

26:36.990 --> 26:38.990
I can give you my word on that.

26:38.990 --> 26:42.990
>> Are you looking at James as
the other target then.

26:42.990 --> 26:43.990
>> I don't know.

26:43.990 --> 26:46.990
I can't really say who the other
target is but --

26:46.990 --> 26:50.990
>> I promise I'm safe
100 percent.

26:50.990 --> 26:51.990
>> Yesterday.

26:51.990 --> 26:52.000
You are not the target.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.990
>> Ok.

26:53.990 --> 26:56.290
I'm safe 100 percent then I will
trust you.

26:56.290 --> 26:56.990
>> Ok.

26:56.990 --> 26:57.990
>> So you're good.

26:57.990 --> 26:59.410
>> Ok.

26:59.410 --> 27:03.990
>> Jackie has not really made a
deep connection with me in this

27:03.990 --> 27:04.990
game.

27:04.990 --> 27:07.950
She basically wants me to tell
her who is my main target.

27:07.950 --> 27:10.990
I feel like I don't owe her
that.

27:10.990 --> 27:16.990
>> Like if people play --
>> we will get to that bridge

27:16.990 --> 27:17.990
when we cross it.

27:17.990 --> 27:20.540
>> Because then you will still
be in charge hopefully.

27:20.540 --> 27:22.290
>> Right.

27:22.290 --> 27:22.990
Right.

27:22.990 --> 27:23.410
>> In charge.

27:23.410 --> 27:24.990
>> Go get your beauty sleep.

27:24.990 --> 27:26.990
>> Ok, girl.

27:26.990 --> 27:35.990
>> Bye.

27:35.990 --> 27:39.000
>> What does she want?

27:39.000 --> 27:42.830
>> People have bails I like --
>> what did she say?

27:42.830 --> 27:47.700
>> She was asking me am I the
target, like am I good?

27:47.700 --> 27:49.990
She was fishing for answers.

27:49.990 --> 27:51.990
And like you don't know me like
that.

27:51.990 --> 27:56.990
And she's acting like -- just
suck.

27:56.990 --> 28:00.990
Like have you ever talked to me
before this and now you're all

28:00.990 --> 28:01.990
buddy buddy?

28:01.990 --> 28:04.990
You have never been close to me
even once.

28:04.990 --> 28:06.990
Like I would not be mad if she
went home.

28:06.990 --> 28:11.410
>> I don't think she's the
immediate target but, hey, crap

28:11.410 --> 28:12.990
happens in the "Big Brother"
house.

28:12.990 --> 28:16.950
So good luck Jackie with battle
of the block.

28:16.950 --> 28:25.990
>> That's why you're on the
block in the first place.

28:25.990 --> 28:30.990
>> This is why it puts me in
that position.

28:30.990 --> 28:36.700
People say stuff and you think
it's true.

28:36.700 --> 28:40.990
>> But I want to be honest with
you.

28:40.990 --> 28:42.990
>> I haven't said that.

28:42.990 --> 28:48.990
>> I am infuriated that Audrey
lied to Shelli so that I would

28:48.990 --> 28:50.410
become a nominee.

28:50.410 --> 28:52.990
There's absolutely no proof that
I would go after Shelli.

28:52.990 --> 28:59.290
I am seriously although alone in
a house full of serpents.

28:59.290 --> 29:03.990
>> I was thinking she was just
not going to drag my name around

29:03.990 --> 29:09.290
anymore and I was wrong:
>> Audrey confuses me when I

29:09.290 --> 29:10.410
talk to her.

29:10.410 --> 29:13.990
>> Audrey has told me that Jason
would go after me.

29:13.990 --> 29:17.990
>> If what Audrey is telling me
is not true I don't know how

29:17.990 --> 29:20.990
much longer I can continue to
protect her in this game.

29:20.990 --> 29:22.990
>> Seriously, dethrone me.

29:22.990 --> 29:25.990
Like I don't want you to go home
>>

29:51.990 --> 29:54.990
>> Liz, please go to the diary
room.

29:54.990 --> 30:04.990
>> No.

30:04.990 --> 30:05.990
>> What did you do?

30:05.990 --> 30:07.990
>> I won hoh.

30:07.990 --> 30:10.990
>> It was a question game.

30:10.990 --> 30:11.990
>> Great.

30:11.990 --> 30:17.990
>> I can't believe you won.

30:17.990 --> 30:23.990
>> And everyone is freak being
out like who was the fourth

30:23.990 --> 30:24.990
mystery vote.

30:24.990 --> 30:27.990
>> Why did you --
>> because you like him.

30:27.990 --> 30:33.540
>> So me and Shelli won hoh
and I put up Jackie and James.

30:33.540 --> 30:34.990
Shelli put up expwraifn John.

30:34.990 --> 30:37.990
Go talk to Austin and he will
fill you in.

30:37.990 --> 30:42.990
I can tell he likes me but --
>> you're a strong competitor

30:42.990 --> 30:48.700
and the reason I'm wearing
myself out, I need flirt with

30:48.700 --> 30:49.990
him and keep him strong.

30:49.990 --> 30:52.990
I'm doing this for us because he
is going to get us further in

30:52.990 --> 30:55.990
the game.

30:55.990 --> 30:57.990
>> Aren't you proud of yourself?

30:57.990 --> 31:01.000
>> I'm so proud of you.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.990
>> I'm smart.

31:02.990 --> 31:05.290
I'm smart!

31:15.990 --> 31:21.000
>> I don't know what the plan
is.

31:21.000 --> 31:26.990
They talked to Johnny mack
before they talked to me.

31:26.990 --> 31:31.990
>> She kind of said it in her
speech though if you really were

31:31.990 --> 31:33.990
the plan she wouldn't have said
that.

31:33.990 --> 31:35.990
>> I'm not there because people
lied so --

31:35.990 --> 31:40.290
>> I think they were talking to
Johnny mack because he has been

31:40.290 --> 31:41.000
up every single week.

31:41.000 --> 31:46.990
>> Because I got one week off in
the game.

31:46.990 --> 31:51.410
>> I have a suspicion John might
want to throw the battle of the

31:51.410 --> 31:52.990
block.

31:52.990 --> 31:55.990
He seems to be just doing what
everybody else tells him and not

31:55.990 --> 31:56.990
what is the best for himself.

31:56.990 --> 32:00.990
>> It's like they're using me
like mig.

32:00.990 --> 32:01.830
>> Is that a thing.

32:01.830 --> 32:03.990
>> It's not called a pawn
anymore.

32:03.990 --> 32:06.290
It's called a Meg.

32:06.290 --> 32:12.540
Just you want somebody out put
Meg up next to them.

32:12.540 --> 32:18.990
>>
>> I can sense that Jason is

32:18.990 --> 32:22.700
fumed, not just because he's
nominated, because I think he

32:22.700 --> 32:26.990
believes I had something to do
with it and to be honest I kind

32:26.990 --> 32:27.990
of did.

32:27.990 --> 32:32.000
>> I have questions and
concerns.

32:32.000 --> 32:36.990
>> Until the last second I
didn't know what was going on.

32:36.990 --> 32:41.990
>> The only person I could think
to target is Jason because of

32:41.990 --> 32:43.990
what you told me.

32:43.990 --> 32:45.120
>> What?

32:45.120 --> 32:48.990
>> I didn't hear that directly
Shelli, like I heard that from

32:48.990 --> 32:52.830
all of you guys like when you
were talking.

32:52.830 --> 32:54.410
>> All of your guys.

32:54.410 --> 32:55.990
>> I swear.

32:55.990 --> 33:00.990
>> Audrey -- my God, that's a
lie and I'm not going to let you

33:00.990 --> 33:03.990
make me believe it.

33:03.990 --> 33:06.410
Audrey -- I have stuck up for
you and I will continue to do so

33:06.410 --> 33:09.000
until you give me a reason not
to and you're starting to give

33:09.000 --> 33:10.990
me a reason not to.

33:10.990 --> 33:14.990
>> I know that our alliance has
already been considering Jason

33:14.990 --> 33:16.950
as a possible target this week.

33:16.950 --> 33:20.990
But Audrey is really putting me
on edge and making me feel very,

33:20.990 --> 33:21.990
very nervous.

33:21.990 --> 33:25.990
I'm just mulling things over in
my head and thinking maybe his

33:25.990 --> 33:28.540
Audrey that needs to go home
this week.

33:28.540 --> 33:41.540
>> You are the one who told me
that Jason would be after me.

33:41.540 --> 33:42.990
I'm very concerned right now.

33:42.990 --> 33:46.990
I'm not planning on anything so
tend you home, Audrey.

33:46.990 --> 33:49.990
Just don't be suspicious of me.

33:49.990 --> 33:54.990
>> My fear is that now, if Jason
stays it's going to come from me

33:54.990 --> 33:57.950
and gets me out.

33:57.950 --> 34:00.990
He will come after you.

34:10.990 --> 34:11.990
>> Time for battle of the block
competition.

34:11.990 --> 34:14.990
Get on your flannels and get
ready to grunge out.

34:26.950 --> 34:27.990
>> Oh, my God.

34:27.990 --> 34:29.990
>> Oh, man.

34:29.990 --> 34:30.990
This is going to be dirty.

34:30.990 --> 34:34.990
>> I walk into the back yard and
I see this 90s grunge theme

34:34.990 --> 34:35.990
going on.

34:35.990 --> 34:40.120
It's pretty cool but I have been
partial to a little Judas

34:40.120 --> 34:41.990
priest.

34:41.990 --> 34:44.990
>> In the early 90s grunge
ruled the world.

34:44.990 --> 34:48.290
If you want to rule the battle
of the block competition you

34:48.290 --> 34:53.540
have to dive into the bb world
of grunge.

34:53.540 --> 34:58.990
Liz's nominees will battle
Shelli's no, nominees to save

34:58.990 --> 34:59.990
themselves from the block.

34:59.990 --> 35:03.290
The winning pair will dethrone
the hoh that nominated them.

35:03.290 --> 35:09.990
Each much you have an Alice tied
up in chains and secured by

35:09.990 --> 35:11.290
padlocks.

35:11.290 --> 35:16.540
Your goal is to free Alice and
take her to nirvana and search

35:16.540 --> 35:18.990
for key through the grunge zone.

35:18.990 --> 35:24.990
>> Find one from pearl jam, one
from the screaming trees and we

35:24.990 --> 35:28.990
will have you smash pumpkins to
find a key.

35:28.990 --> 35:31.990
You can only go to one zone at a
time.

35:31.990 --> 35:36.990
After time you find a key you
must return to Alice and unlock

35:36.990 --> 35:37.990
the padlock.

35:37.990 --> 35:42.990
The first team to take Alice to
nirvana wins the battle of the

35:42.990 --> 35:44.000
block.

35:44.000 --> 35:47.990
The losing team and dethroned
hoh must endure a punishment

35:47.990 --> 35:49.990
all week long.

35:49.990 --> 35:59.990
>> Who is ready to play grunge
Bob?

35:59.990 --> 36:02.990
>> This is the most crucial
battle of the block ever.

36:02.990 --> 36:06.990
I have to make sure I'm safe and
if I can't win the battle of the

36:06.990 --> 36:08.990
block Jason is in big trouble.

36:08.990 --> 36:11.990
>> Winning this battle of the
block is crucial because the

36:11.990 --> 36:14.990
last few weeks I have been
throwing them and I don't want

36:14.990 --> 36:17.410
to take control back into my
game and just go out there and

36:17.410 --> 36:18.990
win it.

36:18.990 --> 36:21.290
>> I'm being told I'm not a
target this week but if anything

36:21.290 --> 36:23.990
happened to Jeff last week and
look where that got him.

36:23.990 --> 36:27.540
>> Ready, set, krudges!

36:32.990 --> 36:36.990
>> The way the block works is
each team has to find four

36:36.990 --> 36:41.990
colored keys to unlocket four
colored lock on their Alice in

36:41.990 --> 36:43.120
chains.

36:43.120 --> 36:47.700
The first team to unlock all
four and bring Alice to nirvana

36:47.700 --> 36:48.990
is safe for the week.

36:48.990 --> 36:54.990
Once we got out of the mud,
honey, we ran right over to

36:54.990 --> 36:55.990
pearl jam.

36:55.990 --> 36:57.990
>> I find the first key pretty
quickly.

36:57.990 --> 37:02.410
Now we run back through the mud
honey and up the ramp to put it

37:02.410 --> 37:03.990
in our lock.

37:03.990 --> 37:09.540
We are one lock down, only three
to go.

37:09.540 --> 37:14.990
>> Ok.

37:14.990 --> 37:18.120
>> Screaming trees are real
crazy.

37:18.120 --> 37:22.990
We have to find this little key
and all of this big old pile of

37:22.990 --> 37:25.540
leave says like finding a needle
in a haystack.

37:25.540 --> 37:27.990
>> The leaves are hard, man.

37:27.990 --> 37:31.990
>> The screaming trees is just
leaves everywhere.

37:31.990 --> 37:35.990
We're ready to dig through and
find the key and now it's

37:35.990 --> 37:40.290
like -- well, the key is just
kind of sitting there.

37:40.290 --> 37:41.990
So I grab it.

37:41.990 --> 37:43.990
>> Oh, we threw the key to them.

37:43.990 --> 37:45.830
>> God it.

37:45.830 --> 37:46.990
Let's go back.

37:46.990 --> 37:49.990
>> Thank you, Jackie and James
for the free yellow key.

37:49.990 --> 37:51.990
You have really cut down our
time.

37:51.990 --> 37:57.950
We see you at nirvana.

37:57.950 --> 37:59.990
>> John and Jason have their
second key.

37:59.990 --> 38:02.990
>> We're still searching for the
second key.

38:02.990 --> 38:05.990
Me and Jackie are so far behind
it's ridiculous.

38:05.990 --> 38:10.410
I'm throwing leaves trying to
find that little dein the big

38:10.410 --> 38:15.990
old pile of leaves is like
trying to get a bill passed in

38:15.990 --> 38:16.950
congress.

38:16.950 --> 38:22.950
>>
>> we finally find our first key

38:22.950 --> 38:27.990
and dive throughout mud honey
and mark our first lock.

38:27.990 --> 38:28.990
Three to go.

38:28.990 --> 38:30.290
Full speed ahead.

38:30.290 --> 38:32.990
>> We got it.

38:32.990 --> 38:38.700
>> Okay.

38:38.700 --> 38:40.830
>> John and Jason have their
third key.

38:40.830 --> 38:42.990
>> We have three keys and they
have like one.

38:42.990 --> 38:51.290
>> I can taste the victory:
>> Next up is the smashing

38:51.290 --> 39:01.700
pumpkins I am ready to rage in
this squash pit.

39:01.700 --> 39:04.990
Pumpkins I am ready to rage in
this squash pit.

39:11.700 --> 39:13.990
>> James and Jackie with a
second key.

39:13.990 --> 39:21.990
>> James and Jackie are catching
up and I'm shaking in my combat

39:21.990 --> 39:22.990
boots.

39:22.990 --> 39:24.950
>> It's difficulty to come up
with the strength to get through

39:24.950 --> 39:25.990
one of these pumpkins.

39:25.990 --> 39:28.990
I have never smashed a pumpkin
in real life.

39:28.990 --> 39:33.700
People put a lot of work in
those Jack-o-lanterns.

39:33.700 --> 39:36.990
It's rude.

39:36.990 --> 39:42.990
>> This is all about wrestling
moves, elbow drop, a knee.

39:42.990 --> 39:49.990
Pumpleg these things open, let's
g.

39:49.990 --> 39:55.990
>> Jackie and I got our third
kee. We make our way throughout

39:55.990 --> 40:02.990
mud honey, and unlock it and
we're ready to go.

40:02.990 --> 40:07.990
>> Jason caught up and this is
the first time I don't want to

40:07.990 --> 40:07.990
win.

40:07.990 --> 40:08.990
Let's do it.

40:08.990 --> 40:10.990
Guitar solo.

40:10.990 --> 40:12.990
>> Oh, yes.

40:12.990 --> 40:15.990
>> We caught up to Jason and
John and now it's on.

40:15.990 --> 40:20.990
We all meet up in the smashing
pumpkin patch and it has turned

40:20.990 --> 40:22.990
into a mosh pit.

40:22.990 --> 40:26.990
>> Hopefully me or Jackie can
come up with the last pumpkin

40:26.990 --> 40:41.290
that has the key in it that
seals the deal.

40:41.290 --> 40:45.990
>> We find our fourth and final
key and head back to Alice to

40:45.990 --> 40:49.410
unlock her and bring her back to
nirvana.

40:49.410 --> 40:54.990
I really want to win the battle
of the block.

40:54.990 --> 41:01.000
>> Now we have our fourth key
and we have to catch up.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.990
It's just about trying to beat
the other team to nirvana.

41:03.990 --> 41:05.990
This is not over yet.

41:05.990 --> 41:06.990
I'm like Houdini.

41:06.990 --> 41:08.990
I can work with chains or
something.

41:08.990 --> 41:09.990
Not a problem.

41:09.990 --> 41:14.990
Let's get up there and get her
free!

41:14.990 --> 41:24.990
>>
>> congratulations, James and

41:24.990 --> 41:25.990
Jackie.

41:25.990 --> 41:28.990
You won the battle of the block
and are now safe for the week!

41:28.990 --> 41:33.990
>> Jackie and I just won battle
of the block and couldn't be any

41:33.990 --> 41:34.990
better.

41:34.990 --> 41:36.990
I don't know what plans the
house had for me and Jackie but

41:36.990 --> 41:39.990
it doesn't matter because, guess
what, we're safe.

41:39.990 --> 41:42.830
>> I'm still hoh this week and
I'm feeling pretty good about

41:42.830 --> 41:45.990
that because this gives me a
little bit more time to ponder

41:45.990 --> 41:50.700
whether or not I might actually
have a bigger target on my

41:50.700 --> 41:50.990
hands.

41:50.990 --> 41:51.990
>> All apologies to Liz.

41:51.990 --> 41:56.700
You are no longer head of
household and must now leave

41:56.700 --> 41:57.830
nirvana.

41:57.830 --> 42:01.990
>> But Liz you will be smelling
like teen spirit!

42:01.990 --> 42:02.990
>> Oh, no.

42:02.990 --> 42:08.290
>> Yeah!

42:08.290 --> 42:14.990
>> I have just in my alliance
they will -- I have trust my

42:14.990 --> 42:17.990
alliance will get me and my
sister through the next few

42:17.990 --> 42:18.990
weeks.

42:18.990 --> 42:21.990
>> Grunge rockers hated boy
bands more than anything so you

42:21.990 --> 42:25.990
will be doing the ultimate
punishment.

42:25.990 --> 42:27.990
You will form a new band.

42:27.990 --> 42:32.990
Any time the pager goes off find
your band mates and get ready to

42:32.990 --> 42:33.990
perform.

42:33.990 --> 42:37.990
>> Like I'm not embarrassed
enough that I just failed the

42:37.990 --> 42:39.290
comp.

42:39.290 --> 42:43.990
Now I have a dance around and
tweedle Dee and tweedledum and

42:43.990 --> 42:44.990
John.

42:44.990 --> 42:48.990
>> Sitting next to Jason he is a
strong competitor.

42:48.990 --> 42:51.990
He is going to fight his heart
out.

42:51.990 --> 42:54.990
Hopefully everything works out.

42:54.990 --> 42:57.990
>> Who will win the power of
veto?

42:57.990 --> 43:00.410
Will it be used to save John or
Jason from eviction?

43:00.410 --> 43:09.540
Find out Wednesday at 8:00, 7:00
central on "Big Brother"!
