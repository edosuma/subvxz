00:01.069 --> 00:02.404
<i>Last time on "Austin & Ally"...</i>

00:02.406 --> 00:04.239
Guess who doesn't
have a date to prom.

00:04.241 --> 00:06.341
- Oh no.
- Did you and Jace break up?

00:06.343 --> 00:08.343
No, but his leg broke up.

00:14.418 --> 00:17.519
Yes.

00:17.521 --> 00:19.855
Will you do me the honor of
letting me take you to your prom?

00:19.857 --> 00:22.457
I can't.

00:22.459 --> 00:25.761
Looks like you and Ally are gonna be
the only two people not going to prom.

00:25.763 --> 00:27.596
Oh, I'm going, just
not with Jace.

00:27.598 --> 00:30.399
Trish and I are going
to prom together.

00:30.401 --> 00:32.968
- What?
- We're gonna win that dance contest, red.

00:32.970 --> 00:36.805
You're wrong, Chuck. 'Cause Carrie and I
are gonna win that dance competition.

00:36.807 --> 00:39.207
Wait a minute, if you
can't move in that dress,

00:39.209 --> 00:40.558
how are you gonna dance?

00:40.589 --> 00:43.341
Trish, I'm really happy
you asked me to prom.

00:47.316 --> 00:49.484
Jace, what are you doing here?

00:49.486 --> 00:52.521
You have no idea what it's like
to be at prom with one person

00:52.523 --> 00:54.790
when there's another person
you'd rather be with.

00:54.821 --> 00:55.821
Mmm.

01:01.898 --> 01:05.400
Actually, I know exactly
what that's like.

01:06.969 --> 01:09.971
Trish, I've made a huge mistake.

01:09.973 --> 01:12.307
I'm not supposed to
be here with Piper.

01:12.309 --> 01:14.743
I'm supposed to be
here with Ally.

01:14.745 --> 01:17.412
And you're not Trish.

01:17.414 --> 01:19.481
You don't wanna be
here with my sister?

01:19.483 --> 01:22.517
Please don't say anything to Piper.
I don't wanna ruin her prom.

01:22.519 --> 01:24.586
- I'm really glad we're here, Austin...
- Oh yeah.

01:24.588 --> 01:26.488
Even if you do have huge pores.

01:28.958 --> 01:31.693
Piper, there's something
I have to tell you.

01:37.600 --> 01:39.568
Uh...

01:39.570 --> 01:41.703
You've got spaghetti sauce
all over your dress.

01:42.972 --> 01:44.539
No, I don't.

01:44.541 --> 01:46.908
Oh, I meant...

01:46.910 --> 01:49.878
I have spaghetti sauce
all over my dress.

01:51.414 --> 01:53.582
On the inside. You can't see it.

01:53.584 --> 01:55.984
Again?

01:55.986 --> 01:58.053
I'll go get you some club soda.

01:58.055 --> 02:00.522
Thanks for not saying anything.

02:00.524 --> 02:02.591
I promise I won't ruin her prom.

02:02.593 --> 02:04.459
Oh, you're gonna do
better than that.

02:04.461 --> 02:07.295
You better give Piper the
best night of her life,

02:07.297 --> 02:10.866
or I'm gonna say something
and ruin your prom.

02:15.071 --> 02:16.106
Where's my sister go?

02:16.137 --> 02:18.807
I thought she wanted to clean
up that spaghetti stain.

02:18.809 --> 02:20.709
Oh, a false alarm.

02:20.711 --> 02:23.011
She realized the stain was
on a different dress.

02:24.780 --> 02:27.782
That doesn't make sense, but
neither does my sister.

02:27.784 --> 02:30.018
Hey, let's go sit
down for a sec.

02:30.020 --> 02:31.887
These shoes are killing me.

02:31.889 --> 02:34.089
We can't sit.

02:34.091 --> 02:35.924
Sitting's not the best
night of your life.

02:35.926 --> 02:37.559
Let's dance.

02:37.561 --> 02:40.929
I just said my feet hurt.

02:40.931 --> 02:42.998
Then get on my back.

02:47.770 --> 02:50.038
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Ally.

02:50.040 --> 02:51.640
You decided to come.

02:51.642 --> 02:54.009
Wow. You look great.

02:55.077 --> 02:57.012
Pfft! I guess she looks okay.

02:57.014 --> 02:58.914
I mean, I've seen
her look better.

02:59.916 --> 03:02.083
Well, see ya.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:01.812 --> 04:04.079
Austin, this is serious.
We need to talk.

04:04.081 --> 04:07.182
Carrie told you everything?

04:07.184 --> 04:10.085
I can't help it.
When I saw Ally,

04:10.087 --> 04:13.088
I realized I wanted to be
with her and not Piper.

04:13.090 --> 04:14.589
What?!

04:15.538 --> 04:17.058
Carrie didn't say
anything about that.

04:19.997 --> 04:22.130
Then what did you want
to talk to me about?

04:22.132 --> 04:24.733
I can't win the dance contest

04:24.735 --> 04:26.901
because of Carrie's stupid...
beautiful dress.

04:26.903 --> 04:28.536
I have to find a
new dance partner,

04:28.538 --> 04:31.072
but I don't want to hurt her stupid...
beautiful feelings.

04:31.074 --> 04:33.074
What are you guys talking about?

04:33.076 --> 04:34.743
We were talking about...

04:34.745 --> 04:38.446
you have a spaghetti stain
on the inside of your dress.

04:38.448 --> 04:41.750
Why does this keep
happening to me?

04:41.752 --> 04:44.686
- Here comes Piper.
- Act cool.

04:46.089 --> 04:48.089
- What's up, guys?
- What do you mean, "what's up?"

04:48.091 --> 04:50.225
How would I know? What's
with all the questions?

04:54.063 --> 04:55.351
What's wrong with him?

04:55.382 --> 04:58.063
I don't have enough time
to fully answer that.

04:59.969 --> 05:01.870
Are you having a
good time, Piper?

05:01.872 --> 05:03.972
Yeah, I'm having a lot of fun.

05:03.974 --> 05:06.074
Good.

05:06.076 --> 05:09.644
The second you're
not, let me know.

05:12.014 --> 05:14.015
Here, I got you some punch.

05:14.017 --> 05:15.424
I got you one of every kind...

05:15.455 --> 05:18.019
And then I mixed a few kinds
to give you more options.

05:18.021 --> 05:21.523
Don't be scared of the brown one.
It's actually pretty good.

05:21.525 --> 05:23.692
Give me two of those.

05:23.694 --> 05:26.127
I told both of my dates
I'd get them drinks.

05:26.129 --> 05:28.530
By the way, have any
of you seen Ally?

05:28.532 --> 05:29.764
Yeah, she's right over there.

05:29.766 --> 05:31.633
She's kind of hard
to see, though,

05:31.635 --> 05:33.134
'cause she's surrounded
by all those cute guys.

05:33.136 --> 05:34.803
Cute guys?

05:37.907 --> 05:39.507
What is she laughing at?

05:39.509 --> 05:42.110
What could they possible
be saying that's so funny?

05:43.813 --> 05:48.216
I'm just curious, 'cause, you know,
I'm always looking for a new joke.

05:54.924 --> 05:59.294
- Here, I got us some carrots.
- I hate carrots.

05:59.296 --> 06:01.963
But I'll eat 'em! That's
the kind of sacrifice

06:01.965 --> 06:03.598
I'm willing to make
for my girlfriend.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.934
I don't think I'm
your girlfriend.

06:05.936 --> 06:07.569
- I...
- I got you something.

06:10.306 --> 06:13.641
- A bracelet?
- It says "Chuck."

06:15.077 --> 06:17.045
Well, that way people will
know you belong to me.

06:17.047 --> 06:19.881
Uh, are you sure you
wanna give this to me?

06:19.883 --> 06:22.250
I've never been more sure of
anything in my whole life.

06:22.252 --> 06:25.220
After sun hee stomped
on my heart,

06:25.222 --> 06:30.792
you're the woman who showed me that
it was possible to feel again.

06:30.794 --> 06:34.095
And here comes the
cold-hearted soul-sucker now.

06:38.601 --> 06:40.769
She still likes me.

06:42.805 --> 06:45.774
Hey, why don't I go get
us something to drink?

06:45.776 --> 06:48.276
I already have a
liquid refreshment.

06:48.278 --> 06:51.646
Oops! I guess now you don't.
I'll be right back.

06:56.118 --> 06:57.952
I'm back.

06:57.954 --> 07:01.289
Sorry it took so long. The line
at the bathroom was horrendous.

07:01.291 --> 07:02.991
I'm so glad I'm here, Trish.

07:02.993 --> 07:05.627
Just being with you is
enough to make me forget

07:05.629 --> 07:08.163
that my fibula's broken
in seven pieces.

07:08.165 --> 07:10.198
Aww.

07:12.001 --> 07:13.201
Oops! Dropped my fork.

07:19.975 --> 07:22.377
Hey, Chuck! Over here!

07:24.046 --> 07:25.313
Wha...?

07:25.315 --> 07:28.716
This is my buddy Jace.
Jace, this is Chuck.

07:28.718 --> 07:30.118
- How you doing, Chuck?
- Howdy.

07:30.120 --> 07:31.820
Jace is just in
town for the prom.

07:31.822 --> 07:36.198
He doesn't know anybody except for me,
Austin, Ally and of course Trish.

07:36.229 --> 07:37.292
Ow!

07:37.294 --> 07:40.361
Ow! Why'd you kick me, red?

07:40.363 --> 07:44.065
- Because you kicked me.
- Oh, I see what you're doing.

07:44.067 --> 07:47.669
You lured me over here under the
pretense of a new friendship.

07:47.671 --> 07:50.004
But you were merely
trying to injure me

07:50.006 --> 07:52.106
so that I couldn't compete
in the dance contest.

07:52.108 --> 07:53.741
No, I wasn't. You kicked me.

07:53.743 --> 07:56.311
Ow! You just kicked me again!

07:58.114 --> 08:00.682
Ow! Stop!

08:00.684 --> 08:02.183
- Ow ow.
- Git!

08:08.090 --> 08:10.058
Did you find the fork?

08:10.060 --> 08:12.293
Huh? Oh, right.

08:21.270 --> 08:27.108
Austin, you're staring, and the person
you're staring at isn't your date.

08:28.377 --> 08:30.178
I can't help it.

08:30.180 --> 08:32.947
I wish I was here with
Ally instead of Piper.

08:32.948 --> 08:34.749
I know how you feel.

08:34.751 --> 08:37.418
I wish I was here with
Jace instead of Chuck.

08:37.419 --> 08:40.688
And I wish I was here with Carrie
wearing a dress that she can dance in

08:40.690 --> 08:43.691
instead of Carrie wearing a
dress that she can't dance in.

08:43.693 --> 08:45.360
Guess we're all
in the same boat.

08:45.362 --> 08:48.029
Yeah, we're not
in the same boat.

08:49.064 --> 08:52.171
This was supposed to be one of the
greatest nights of our lives.

08:52.202 --> 08:54.520
And instead, it turned
into a total nightmare.

08:55.704 --> 08:56.838
Bad news, darlin'.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.773
Me and sun hee just
got back together.

08:58.775 --> 09:00.936
I'm gonna need that
bracelet back.

09:08.918 --> 09:11.486
Yes!

09:11.488 --> 09:13.888
I'm off the hook.
Good luck, Austin.

09:13.890 --> 09:15.390
Jace.

09:17.860 --> 09:20.295
You're never gonna win,
dancing like that, red.

09:20.297 --> 09:24.098
I'm gonna win that thousand dollars
and buy new woodworking tools.

09:24.100 --> 09:25.366
Hee hee!

09:32.408 --> 09:36.177
- One more song?
- We've been dancing for over an hour.

09:36.179 --> 09:38.112
I know. Aren't you having fun?

09:38.114 --> 09:40.014
Isn't this the best
night of your life?

09:40.016 --> 09:43.217
Best, weirdest...
one of those two.

09:44.353 --> 09:46.287
Austin, what's going on?

09:46.289 --> 09:48.122
Is this about Ally?

09:48.124 --> 09:50.291
You've been acting strange
ever since she got here.

09:50.293 --> 09:52.160
No, I haven't.

09:52.162 --> 09:54.796
A lot of people say you've
been acting strange.

09:54.798 --> 09:56.030
Forget it.

09:56.032 --> 09:58.132
I'm gonna go get
something to drink.

09:58.134 --> 10:01.002
Okay. I'll be at our table.

10:01.004 --> 10:03.438
I mean...

10:03.440 --> 10:05.173
I'm gonna stay over here.

10:08.110 --> 10:10.979
Might as well kiss that dance
contest money goodbye.

10:10.981 --> 10:13.181
Why can't you be
my dance partner?

10:14.149 --> 10:15.383
So many reasons.

10:16.852 --> 10:18.853
So far, so good with Piper.

10:18.855 --> 10:20.575
I just have to avoid
Ally for another hour.

10:22.424 --> 10:25.893
Hey, everyone! I'm Kimmy,
your prom chairwoman.

10:25.895 --> 10:27.862
I hope you're all
enjoying tonight.

10:29.164 --> 10:31.232
I'm not. My date has chickenpox.

10:32.234 --> 10:36.104
Anyway, it's time to announce
this year's prom queen and king!

10:36.106 --> 10:39.474
<i>This year's prom king is...</i>

10:40.476 --> 10:42.443
Austin Moon!

10:50.052 --> 10:53.955
And this year's prom queen is...

10:53.957 --> 10:56.090
Don't be Ally, don't be
Ally, don't be Ally.

10:56.092 --> 10:59.661
Ally Dawson!

11:21.583 --> 11:25.386
And now it's time for the traditional
king and queen slow dance.

11:25.388 --> 11:28.156
- Does it have to be slow?
- Yes.

11:40.235 --> 11:41.969
I'm sorry.

11:41.971 --> 11:43.337
Do you mind if I go talk
to Piper for a sec?

11:43.339 --> 11:46.007
Why would I mind?

11:46.009 --> 11:49.444
I love dancing by myself in
front of the whole school.

11:49.446 --> 11:51.546
- Cool. Thanks.
- Wha...?

11:53.382 --> 11:55.149
Piper, can I talk to you?

11:55.151 --> 11:57.652
I think that's
probably a good idea.

12:03.659 --> 12:07.061
Don't worry, Ally. I'll dance
with you till Austin gets back.

12:07.063 --> 12:09.163
No, you don't have to... okay.

12:14.470 --> 12:18.406
Look, Piper, what I'm
trying to tell you is...

12:19.374 --> 12:21.275
I thought that...

12:21.277 --> 12:23.211
Okay, here's the thing...

12:23.213 --> 12:25.246
Let me stop you right there.

12:25.248 --> 12:27.048
You still like Ally.

12:27.050 --> 12:29.050
I'm sorry.

12:29.052 --> 12:31.352
I was trying not to
talk about it tonight,

12:31.354 --> 12:33.688
because I didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

12:33.690 --> 12:36.224
I wanted you to have
a good time tonight.

12:36.226 --> 12:38.192
If this is going where
I think it's going,

12:38.194 --> 12:40.294
can you at least take
that crown off your head?

12:40.296 --> 12:43.164
Sorry.

12:43.166 --> 12:46.300
Look, I really like you, and...

12:46.302 --> 12:48.169
Let me stop you again.

12:48.171 --> 12:50.204
We've only been going
out for like a month.

12:50.206 --> 12:54.942
Better I find out now than a year from
now when we're at an Italian restaurant

12:54.944 --> 12:58.179
and you're going on about how
much Ally loves garlic knots.

12:58.181 --> 13:00.248
Actually, she prefers
breadsticks,

13:00.250 --> 13:03.217
because they're easier
to dip in the marinara.

13:03.219 --> 13:05.019
Never mind.

13:05.903 --> 13:08.990
Look, Austin, if you
wanna be with Ally,

13:08.992 --> 13:12.026
you should go in there right
now and tell her how you feel.

13:14.464 --> 13:16.364
Thanks for being so
cool about this.

13:16.366 --> 13:17.999
Yeah yeah.

13:19.201 --> 13:21.102
But if anyone asks, I
broke up with you.

13:26.175 --> 13:28.576
- You can put me down now.
- Oh.

13:29.978 --> 13:32.246
Congratulations, your highness.

13:33.550 --> 13:35.750
Thanks.

13:35.752 --> 13:38.052
Aren't you getting
tired of standing?

13:39.021 --> 13:40.342
Why don't you
borrow my crutches?

13:41.323 --> 13:43.191
These are perfect.

13:43.193 --> 13:46.194
I'm so glad your leg is broken.

13:47.362 --> 13:49.230
Hey, maybe you can
dance with those.

13:50.333 --> 13:53.301
- Whoo!
- Oh man.

13:54.469 --> 13:56.270
No. You can't.

13:57.673 --> 14:00.308
I guess I can forget about
winning that dance contest.

14:00.310 --> 14:02.510
And the thousand dollars.

14:02.512 --> 14:04.145
Wait a sec.

14:04.147 --> 14:09.517
You and Trish both really wanna enter
the contest, but your dates can't.

14:09.519 --> 14:11.519
The solution is obvious.

14:11.521 --> 14:13.387
So obvious!

14:14.656 --> 14:18.693
But maybe they don't know what it is,
so you might wanna say it out loud.

14:21.029 --> 14:26.100
She means me and you should enter
the dance contest together.

14:26.102 --> 14:28.236
Exactly. You guys get that now?

14:34.743 --> 14:36.477
Ally?

14:38.113 --> 14:40.514
Umm...

14:40.516 --> 14:42.283
There's something
I wanna tell you.

14:52.527 --> 14:54.195
Gavin?!

14:54.197 --> 14:57.465
Ally, will you be my
date to the prom?

15:07.175 --> 15:08.709
So what do you think, Ally?

15:08.711 --> 15:10.678
I'm your knight
in shining armor.

15:10.680 --> 15:13.114
I can't believe this.

15:13.116 --> 15:14.749
About time you got here, Gavin!

15:16.151 --> 15:19.086
Wait. You knew he was coming?

15:19.088 --> 15:22.089
Yup. I told you I could
keep a secret. Ha!

15:22.091 --> 15:23.724
Wha...?

15:23.726 --> 15:26.727
Hey, everybody, I don't
wanna single anybody out,

15:26.729 --> 15:28.729
but I'd just like to remind
you that there's a strict

15:28.731 --> 15:30.765
no-horses-allowed-
in-the-gym policy.

15:30.767 --> 15:33.668
Thank you.

15:33.670 --> 15:36.604
I have a gut feeling
she's talking about me.

15:36.606 --> 15:38.406
I guess I oughtta park
this fella outside.

15:38.408 --> 15:40.207
I'll go with you.

15:45.480 --> 15:49.116
And now it's time for
the dance contest!

15:50.385 --> 15:53.421
- This is it.
- Let's go win that thousand dollars.

15:55.691 --> 15:58.859
- Good luck.
- Break a leg, but not like mine.

16:00.562 --> 16:02.563
This is an elimination
competition.

16:02.565 --> 16:04.598
So when the music starts,
everybody dances

16:04.600 --> 16:07.401
until me or one of the
other judges taps you out.

16:39.568 --> 16:42.737
I thought you were going to
the pig mud run tonight.

16:42.739 --> 16:44.905
Well, I realized you're more
important to me than that.

16:45.544 --> 16:47.881
I know the first time I
didn't ask you to prom the

16:47.912 --> 16:50.173
way you wanted, so I thought
if I did it right...

16:50.179 --> 16:53.614
Gavin, I didn't say no because
of the way you asked.

16:53.616 --> 16:55.649
I said no because...

16:58.454 --> 17:00.588
I don't think we're
right for each other.

17:00.590 --> 17:04.191
Wow. I'm getting
dumped on prom night.

17:05.359 --> 17:07.795
It's a good thing I'm
a country singer.

17:07.797 --> 17:10.498
I could write a song about this.

17:10.500 --> 17:13.534
I'll call it "dumped
on prom night."

17:13.536 --> 17:15.803
Yeah. And you can spell
"night" with a "k,"

17:15.805 --> 17:17.442
because you're all
dressed up like a...

17:17.473 --> 17:18.473
Yeah, I get it.

17:19.842 --> 17:24.244
That's one thing I'm really gonna miss...
we did write great songs together.

17:24.247 --> 17:26.247
Maybe we could still do that.

17:26.249 --> 17:28.482
That'd be nice.

17:31.820 --> 17:33.890
I... guess I should
get back inside.

17:33.921 --> 17:34.921
Yeah.

17:44.933 --> 17:47.401
Well, it looks like it's just
me and you now, snowflake.

18:23.906 --> 18:27.007
You're going down, red!
And curly.

18:30.579 --> 18:31.745
Pfft! Please!

18:31.747 --> 18:35.483
You're going so far down, elevators
won't have down buttons,

18:35.485 --> 18:37.651
they'll have "Chuck
and sun hee" buttons!

18:37.653 --> 18:38.594
Wa-bam!

18:38.625 --> 18:42.356
You're going so far down, pillows
won't have down feathers,

18:42.358 --> 18:44.925
they'll have "Dez and
Trish" feathers.

18:44.927 --> 18:47.661
- Oh.
- Big finish!

19:04.012 --> 19:05.479
Bigger finish.

19:09.684 --> 19:11.952
Okay, the winners of this
year's dance contest...

19:11.954 --> 19:15.389
Dez and Trish!

19:15.391 --> 19:17.791
- They win a thousand dollars...
- Oh!

19:17.793 --> 19:20.928
Which will be donated in their name
to the Marino high woodcarving club

19:20.930 --> 19:23.497
so that they can buy new tools!

19:24.799 --> 19:26.800
- Huh?
- Say what now?

19:26.802 --> 19:29.837
Hey, that's my club.

19:29.839 --> 19:30.399
Oh.

19:30.430 --> 19:32.640
Looks like I'm getting
new tools after all.

19:32.642 --> 19:35.009
Thanks for your
generous donation.

19:39.549 --> 19:41.949
- So long, red.
- Oh!

19:41.951 --> 19:46.086
- Hee hee!
- Hee hee!

19:53.094 --> 19:56.497
Hey, Ally. Where's Gavin?

19:56.499 --> 19:59.934
I just broke up with him.

20:01.069 --> 20:02.436
Really?

20:03.805 --> 20:05.773
I just broke up with Piper.

20:07.075 --> 20:09.877
But if she asks, I told
you she broke up with me.

20:15.750 --> 20:18.953
Hey, we never got to
do that slow dance.

20:20.455 --> 20:21.855
What do you say?

20:23.158 --> 20:24.692
I'd love to.

20:35.537 --> 20:40.107
So... why did you
and Piper break up?

20:41.644 --> 20:43.577
Because I still have
feelings for you.

20:44.946 --> 20:47.615
I've always liked you.

20:47.617 --> 20:49.883
I guess I've never stopped.

20:50.919 --> 20:52.653
I feel the same way.

20:53.688 --> 20:56.090
I always dreamed
of going to prom

20:56.092 --> 20:57.246
with the perfect guy.

20:59.027 --> 21:01.128
And the perfect guy is you.

21:01.130 --> 21:03.564
So...

21:03.566 --> 21:05.853
I didn't bring a horse or
fireworks or anything...

21:07.669 --> 21:09.136
and it's a little late, but...

21:10.138 --> 21:12.106
Would you be my prom date?

21:13.642 --> 21:15.142
Yes.

21:21.916 --> 21:24.785
- This is so romantic.
- I know.

21:26.021 --> 21:27.021
- Eww!
- Yuck!

21:27.023 --> 21:28.956
- Jace!
- Carrie!

21:43.972 --> 21:46.473
Nice moves, babe.
You too, dudes.

21:49.144 --> 21:52.079
For the record, I know you
came to prom with Chuck.

21:52.081 --> 21:54.615
What?!

21:54.617 --> 21:56.116
Dez told me.

21:58.887 --> 22:01.121
You know he can't keep a secret.

22:01.123 --> 22:03.090
- Are you mad?
- No.

22:03.092 --> 22:04.958
I know you wanted to use the
money to come visit me.

22:04.960 --> 22:07.127
Plus I've met Chuck.

22:07.129 --> 22:09.496
There's no way you
like that guy.

22:14.969 --> 22:19.173
Now this is exactly how
I pictured tonight.
