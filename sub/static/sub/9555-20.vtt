Joanie.
How's the sign coming along?

01:31.592 --> 01:33.060
Ooh, I just finished it.
Give me a hand.

01:33.193 --> 01:35.161
- Oh, great. -Take your tack and
we'll put it up on the door.

01:35.295 --> 01:36.285
- All right.
- Okay.

01:37.364 --> 01:38.593
I called the hotel
from Fonzie's.

01:38.732 --> 01:39.824
Uh-huh. (grunts)

01:39.967 --> 01:41.025
Everything's all set.

01:41.168 --> 01:42.533
Mom and Dad are confirmed
for this weekend.

01:42.669 --> 01:44.296
- Oh, what a great gift!
- Yeah.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.304
A second honeymoon
on their 23rd anniversary.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.430
Yeah.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.634
Did you people eat?

01:54.615 --> 01:55.673
"You people"?

01:55.816 --> 01:57.045
Mom, what's the matter?

01:57.184 --> 01:58.117
I'm fine.

01:58.251 --> 02:00.310
I'll fix you
a bite of something.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.115
Uh, they're just having
a little spat.

02:02.255 --> 02:03.484
We'll just ignore it.

02:03.624 --> 02:04.557
Oh, there's Dad.

02:04.691 --> 02:05.681
Oh!

02:08.595 --> 02:10.586
Good morning, Richard, Joanie.

02:13.033 --> 02:14.159
Good morning, Dad.

02:14.301 --> 02:15.632
I'll go to the kitchen.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.760
I'm told that's where I belong.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.635
Uh... nice day.

02:25.779 --> 02:26.905
Prove it.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.244
Dad, what's the matter?

02:31.385 --> 02:33.376
Nothing's the matter.

02:33.520 --> 02:34.885
Oh, listen to this.

02:35.022 --> 02:36.421
Your mother and I took this test

02:36.556 --> 02:38.684
in this magazine
and look what she said.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.725
"If you went out on a date
with your husband,

02:40.861 --> 02:41.919
"how would you rate him?

02:42.062 --> 02:44.429
<i>"'A,'</i> Wowsville;
'B,' a fun time;

02:44.564 --> 02:46.828
'C,' okay; and 'D,' a drag."

02:46.967 --> 02:48.264
You know what
your mother answered?

02:48.402 --> 02:49.801
Inc'! okay"!

02:49.936 --> 02:52.268
Can you imagine? "Okay"!

02:54.741 --> 02:56.937
Excuse me, bud.

02:57.077 --> 02:58.203
- What about this?
- Mm-hmm?

02:58.345 --> 03:00.939
"How would you describe
your wife's personality?

03:01.081 --> 03:03.516
<i>"'A,'</i> super; 'B,' exciting;

03:03.650 --> 03:06.244
'C,' average; 'D,' bearable."

03:06.386 --> 03:08.480
You know what
your father picked?

03:08.622 --> 03:10.386
-"'C,' average."
-"'C,' average."

03:10.524 --> 03:11.582
The nerve!

03:11.725 --> 03:12.658
(doorbell rings)

03:12.793 --> 03:13.783
<i>- I'll</i> get it.
<i>- I'll</i> get it.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.235
Ba-dum-ba-dum-bum-bum!

03:22.369 --> 03:24.360
Happy Anniver...
- Shh!

03:35.015 --> 03:36.005
Mr. C.

03:36.149 --> 03:37.014
Fonzie.

03:37.150 --> 03:38.584
Mrs. C.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.915
How do you do, Arthur?

03:42.689 --> 03:43.884
Richard, would you
tell your father

03:44.024 --> 03:46.322
that all "Mrs. Average"
can come up with

03:46.460 --> 03:47.950
is cold cereal?

03:48.095 --> 03:49.085
Okay.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.094
- Uh, all Mrs. Average...
-(Fonzie snaps fingers)

03:50.230 --> 03:51.163
Let's go.

03:51.298 --> 03:52.527
Mr. C., Mrs. C.,
conference time,

03:52.666 --> 03:53.929
over here, right now.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.228
Well, how nice.

03:55.368 --> 03:57.097
I've never been to one of
his conferences before.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.001
Come on, bud.

03:59.139 --> 04:01.130
It's conference time.

04:02.142 --> 04:03.132
Inc'! okay"!

04:07.881 --> 04:10.282
Now, I probably shouldn't be
meddling in your affairs...

04:10.417 --> 04:11.282
That's true.

04:11.418 --> 04:12.476
...but I'm going to anyway.

04:12.619 --> 04:14.519
My favorite
middle class family, here,

04:14.654 --> 04:15.849
is in a middle class spat.

04:15.989 --> 04:17.115
That's true.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.622
Yeah, but aren't you, uh,

04:18.759 --> 04:19.783
forgetting something?

04:19.926 --> 04:21.087
HOWARD:
Mmm?

04:24.431 --> 04:25.830
That's right.

04:25.966 --> 04:28.731
Mom, Dad, tomorrow's your 23rd
wedding anniversary, right?

04:28.869 --> 04:30.303
So we all chipped in.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.871
We got you what we think is

04:32.005 --> 04:33.439
a very special surprise present.

04:33.573 --> 04:35.337
It's gonna knock your socks off!

04:35.475 --> 04:38.342
A weekend at the, uh,
Holiday Shores Lodge.

04:38.478 --> 04:40.674
The same place
you spent your honeymoon.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.248
L-I can't go.

04:42.382 --> 04:44.009
L-I have to have
my hair done tomorrow.

04:44.151 --> 04:45.949
Shortcake...
took care of that.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.316
Changed your appointment
to Tuesday, Mom.

04:48.455 --> 04:51.083
Now, look, it's
a 55-mile drive to Lake Geneva

04:51.224 --> 04:52.953
and the DeSoto has
to be tuned up and...

04:53.093 --> 04:55.061
- Heyyy!
- HOWARD: That figures.

04:57.063 --> 04:58.428
That's it!
No more excuses.

04:58.565 --> 04:59.964
Come on, Snookums.

05:01.201 --> 05:02.066
Snookums?

05:02.202 --> 05:03.328
RICHIE:
Yeah.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.460
That's what Mom called Dad

05:04.604 --> 05:05.628
on their first honeymoon.
Snookums.

05:05.772 --> 05:07.001
Yeah, but, uh, look,

05:07.140 --> 05:08.539
it looks like it's gonna rain
out there, you know?

05:08.675 --> 05:10.165
And you called her Babycakes.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.175
That's right.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.540
But we haven't packed.

05:12.679 --> 05:15.080
Yeah, and the traffic is
terrible at this time of day.

05:15.215 --> 05:16.444
The bags are in the car.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.278
Yeah, Babycakes,
yours are in the trunk

05:18.418 --> 05:20.352
and, uh, Snookums,
yours are in the back seat.

05:20.487 --> 05:21.886
That's right.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.354
There is nothing
more to discuss.

05:24.491 --> 05:28.257
Maybe we could get
our old room, 325.

05:28.395 --> 05:30.193
It was 324.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.320
Howard, no, it wasn't.

05:31.464 --> 05:32.329
- It was...
- I remember,

05:32.465 --> 05:33.955
it faced the lake, it was 325.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.728
It was 324, Marion,
and I'll prove it to you.

05:36.870 --> 05:37.803
I'll drive!

05:37.938 --> 05:39.269
HOWARD:
Good, I'll be in the back seat!

05:39.406 --> 05:40.464
Have a nice time.

05:40.607 --> 05:41.472
Have a nice time, Mom.

05:41.608 --> 05:42.837
Happy anniversary.

05:47.614 --> 05:49.048
Hey, huh, huh?

05:49.182 --> 05:51.446
Room 325, huh?
(laughs)

05:51.585 --> 05:53.576
I'm never wrong.

05:55.689 --> 05:56.850
You know, I don't remember

05:56.990 --> 05:59.118
carrying up my own luggage
last time.

05:59.259 --> 06:00.351
Sure you do, Howard.

06:00.493 --> 06:01.358
Don't you remember?

06:01.494 --> 06:02.825
You wanted to save the tip.

06:06.233 --> 06:09.032
Howard, the room's
hardly changed.

06:11.571 --> 06:13.869
It's changed some, Marion.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.873
Oh, I wonder if there's still

06:16.009 --> 06:19.377
that romantic view of
the lake from this window?

06:19.512 --> 06:21.412
Oh, Howard, a tree.

06:21.548 --> 06:22.982
Romantic view, huh?

06:23.116 --> 06:25.244
Looks like you'll have to wait
till the leaves fall.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.149
Now, Howard, don't be cranky.

06:27.287 --> 06:29.051
Let's just make the best of it.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.180
Ah, you're right.

06:32.859 --> 06:34.725
You know...

06:34.861 --> 06:36.556
you did look quite beautiful

06:36.696 --> 06:38.528
in the moonlight
by this window...

06:38.665 --> 06:40.224
<i>Babycakes.</i>

06:40.367 --> 06:42.836
Thank you, Snookums.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.369
It was exciting, wasn't it?

06:47.507 --> 06:48.633
Yes, it was.

06:48.775 --> 06:50.265
Think we can get the old...

06:50.410 --> 06:52.003
the old excitement back again?

06:52.145 --> 06:54.705
Well, that's what second
honeymoons are for, aren't they?

06:54.848 --> 06:56.338
Oh, Howard.

06:56.483 --> 06:57.882
Oh, let's try. Let's...

06:58.018 --> 07:00.646
Let's try to make everything
just the same way

07:00.787 --> 07:03.688
that it was before,
the-the room, the mood...

07:03.823 --> 07:05.450
lust everything.

07:05.592 --> 07:06.457
Everything?

07:06.593 --> 07:07.754
Everything!

07:07.894 --> 07:10.090
Oh, that sounds
great to me, Babycakes.

07:10.230 --> 07:11.891
- Oh, but first, Howard,
Howard... -Huh?

07:12.032 --> 07:13.329
If we're gonna have
everything just the same,

07:13.466 --> 07:15.457
this table was down here,

07:15.602 --> 07:17.001
right by the dresser.

07:17.137 --> 07:20.004
You push that one,
I'll push this one, okay?

07:20.140 --> 07:21.471
Okay.

07:21.608 --> 07:22.700
There.

07:22.842 --> 07:25.174
Now, if we could just get
one big bedspread...

07:25.312 --> 07:26.780
Marion!

07:26.913 --> 07:28.574
Oh, I almost forgot.

07:28.715 --> 07:29.580
The champagne.

07:29.716 --> 07:31.377
I've taken care of that.

07:31.518 --> 07:33.486
Now, let's see.
What did we do next, huh?

07:33.620 --> 07:36.920
Well, while I was unpacking,
you were hiding in the bathroom.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.492
Let's skip that part this time.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.494
Oh...

07:43.630 --> 07:46.190
(knocking at door)

07:46.333 --> 07:47.391
MAN:
Room service!

07:47.534 --> 07:48.399
- Oh.
- Oh, goody!

07:48.535 --> 07:50.230
- That's the champagne.
- Mmm.

07:50.370 --> 07:52.304
I'll get the glasses.

07:52.439 --> 07:54.771
-(knocking at door)
- Come in.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.510
The champagne you ordered.

08:03.650 --> 08:04.515
Yeah, that's right.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.050
My name is Otto.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.746
I hear that people
who order champagne,

08:08.888 --> 08:11.050
they are big tippers, eh?

08:11.191 --> 08:12.716
Just put it on the table, Otto.

08:12.859 --> 08:13.724
Yes, sir!

08:13.860 --> 08:15.851
We'll put it right on the table.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.157
You moved the table!

08:20.300 --> 08:22.291
Now I gotta vacuum!

08:23.570 --> 08:26.904
Ooh... hey. (laughs)

08:27.040 --> 08:29.202
Hey!

08:29.342 --> 08:30.810
- Wait a minute, wait a minute...
- Yeah?

08:30.944 --> 08:34.710
Didn't you work here when we
were here last, 23 years ago?

08:34.847 --> 08:38.182
Well, my, uh,
my brother and I, Bruno,

08:38.318 --> 08:40.844
-we owned the hotel
almost 30 years. -Yeah.

08:40.986 --> 08:42.921
And we still got the mortgage.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.148
Oh, oh, oh.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.887
Ah, here you are.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.018
Wow.

08:50.397 --> 08:51.831
A whole quarter.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.764
Plenty more
where that came from.

08:54.901 --> 08:58.098
You brought the whole roll,
didn't you?

08:58.238 --> 08:59.228
All right, thank you very much.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.033
He was an ingrate then...

09:05.578 --> 09:08.104
Marion, come on,
what's taking you so long?

09:08.248 --> 09:10.774
Oh, I, uh, just had to rearrange
the bathroom, dear.

09:10.917 --> 09:12.043
The towels were
on the wrong side

09:12.185 --> 09:13.311
and I had to unwrap all the...

09:13.453 --> 09:15.581
Yes, never mind, sweetheart,
just unwrap the glasses

09:15.722 --> 09:18.054
while I open the champagne, huh?

09:19.359 --> 09:20.724
There we go.

09:20.860 --> 09:22.589
There.

09:22.729 --> 09:26.597
A little of
the bubbly for you...

09:26.733 --> 09:29.134
and a little of
the bubbly for me.

09:33.139 --> 09:34.504
To us!

09:34.641 --> 09:36.131
Oh, no, Howard, not yet!

09:36.276 --> 09:37.175
What?

09:37.310 --> 09:38.505
What now, Marion?

09:38.645 --> 09:39.976
Don't you remember?

09:40.113 --> 09:41.672
I was in the bathroom

09:41.815 --> 09:44.580
and you were sitting on the bed
with the two glasses

09:44.717 --> 09:47.982
and then you called out,
"Yoo-hoo, Babycakes."

09:48.121 --> 09:50.715
"Yoo-hoo, Babycakes"?

09:50.857 --> 09:53.258
Do we have to be
that exact, Marion?

09:53.393 --> 09:55.794
Oh, Howard...

09:55.929 --> 09:57.897
All right.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.595
Now, let's see...

10:07.807 --> 10:10.435
She was in the bathroom...

10:10.577 --> 10:13.444
and I was lying on the bed...
Whoa!

10:15.615 --> 10:17.140
MARION:
Howard?

10:17.283 --> 10:18.717
Howard?

10:18.852 --> 10:20.616
Did you get hurt, dear?

10:20.753 --> 10:21.618
Howard?

10:21.754 --> 10:24.018
Where are you, Howard?

10:25.925 --> 10:28.189
Would you kindly sit down,
please, enjoy your dinner,

10:28.328 --> 10:31.457
and I shall be back shortly.

10:31.598 --> 10:34.158
Pick up that salad!

10:34.300 --> 10:36.826
Oh, Howard, look,
there's our old table.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.096
Let's sit there.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.763
Well, Marion,
there's someone sitting there.

10:39.906 --> 10:42.000
Oh, I'm sure he won't mind,
there's plenty of other tables.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.610
No, but look,
sweetheart, you can't...

10:43.743 --> 10:45.211
- Excuse me.
- Uh...

10:45.345 --> 10:47.336
Uh, my husband would like
to ask you a question.

10:48.848 --> 10:50.646
- Go ahead, Howard.
- Yeah.

10:50.783 --> 10:52.342
- Uh, good evening.
- Good evening.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.510
Uh, you see, we're-we're
on our second honeymoon

10:54.654 --> 10:58.921
and, heh, we had this very same
table many, many years ago,

10:59.058 --> 11:00.457
and, well,
it's kind of sentimental

11:00.593 --> 11:03.062
and we were wondering, would you
mind moving to another table?

11:03.196 --> 11:04.925
(laughing)

11:05.064 --> 11:05.929
Sport, come here.

11:06.065 --> 11:07.590

.(laughs)

11:07.734 --> 11:08.929
You can't have this table.

11:09.068 --> 11:10.058
I can't.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.103
You see, I'm meeting
a lady friend.

11:12.238 --> 11:13.228
Oh, a lady friend.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.772
Who's not my wife.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.239
She's not...?

11:17.744 --> 11:19.940
And I have to get
a good look at the door.

11:20.079 --> 11:21.137
The door...

11:21.281 --> 11:22.510
And you're in my way.

11:22.649 --> 11:23.639
Ah.

11:26.219 --> 11:27.209
What'd he say, dear?

11:27.353 --> 11:28.582
He says we can't have the table

11:28.721 --> 11:30.052
because he's waiting
for a lady friend.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.385
He's gotta keep an eye
on the door

11:31.524 --> 11:32.514
in case his wife catches him.

11:32.659 --> 11:33.785
Let's get out of here.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.156
Why, the nasty man!

11:35.295 --> 11:36.285
No, Marion!

11:38.064 --> 11:40.658
Will you just go over there and
sit at the piano bar, please?

11:40.800 --> 11:43.633
Oh, wasn't this on the other
side of the room before?

11:43.770 --> 11:44.896
Now, look, sweetheart.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.871
I have rearranged enough
furniture for one day.

11:48.007 --> 11:49.372
I'm not going to move
the piano bar.

11:49.509 --> 11:52.535
Now, come on,
let's just sit down, huh?

11:55.281 --> 11:56.715
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

11:56.849 --> 11:58.510
The Blue Lagoon
now proudly presents,

11:58.651 --> 12:00.449
for your dining and
listening pleasure,

12:00.587 --> 12:04.046
the sensational keyboard talent
of Mr. Danny Cotter!

12:07.427 --> 12:09.418
Thanks for that
great introduction.

12:17.770 --> 12:20.000
Marion, isn't that
the same piano player

12:20.139 --> 12:21.766
that was here 23 years ago?

12:21.908 --> 12:22.875
MARION:
Ooh, you're right.

12:23.009 --> 12:24.204
At last, something
is exactly the same.

12:24.344 --> 12:25.209
HOWARD:
Yeah.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.109
We remember your playing

12:27.247 --> 12:29.648
when we were here 23 years ago.

12:29.782 --> 12:31.477
Lady, that was my father!

12:31.618 --> 12:32.608
Oh.

12:34.020 --> 12:37.718
Uh, do you remember
"Moonlight in Vermont"?

12:37.857 --> 12:41.122
My husband and I danced to that
on our wedding night.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.161
I don't think so.

12:56.075 --> 12:57.702
I'm not a jukebox.

13:03.182 --> 13:05.674
Now I remember it.

13:07.420 --> 13:10.014
<i>II</i>

13:10.156 --> 13:13.888
No. No, no, that-that's
"Moonlight Becomes You."

13:14.027 --> 13:15.324
Look, your father used to play

13:15.461 --> 13:17.259
"Moonlight in Vermont."
Can't you play it?

13:17.397 --> 13:19.388
What's the difference?
A moon's a moon.

13:20.433 --> 13:21.992
Cocktails for dinner?

13:22.135 --> 13:24.263
Yeah, bring us a couple
of vodka martinis, please.

13:24.404 --> 13:25.997
- Martinis.
- Oh, wait, Howard. -Hm?

13:26.139 --> 13:28.198
We didn't have martinis
on our honeymoon.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.275
- We each had a stingray.
- Oh, oh.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.344
- Remember? -Yeah.
Uh, make that two stingrays.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.207
Very good.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.315
I think I've got it now.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.315
<i>II</i>

13:38.451 --> 13:41.352
Oh, Howard, he won't play
"Moonlight in Vermont."

13:41.487 --> 13:43.285
Would you fix him?

13:43.423 --> 13:45.255
What do you want me
to do, Marion?

13:45.391 --> 13:47.951
Well, pay him so that he will
play "Moonlight in Vermont."

13:48.094 --> 13:51.257
Well, why should I pay him if
he doesn't know how to play it?

13:51.397 --> 13:53.525
Now, listen, Marion,
I almost threw my back out

13:53.666 --> 13:56.067
falling between two beds,
I could've gotten beaten up

13:56.202 --> 13:58.330
by a man who's cheating
on his wife, and now

13:58.471 --> 14:00.303
you want me to fix
the piano player.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.375
Now, that's asking an awful lot
for just an okay date, Marion.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.204
You know,
I really think it's silly

14:05.345 --> 14:06.870
to try and relive the past.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.208
Howard, it isn't silly.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.838
Oh, this isn't working at all.

14:09.982 --> 14:11.848
It's your fault--
you're just not trying.

14:11.984 --> 14:14.476
I'm going to the room.

14:14.620 --> 14:17.089
I'm gonna tell your wife!

14:20.026 --> 14:22.017
She knows my wife?
She knows Gladys!

14:22.161 --> 14:24.220
I got to get out of here.

14:24.364 --> 14:27.026
Drinks for Cunningham!

14:33.005 --> 14:35.167
The stingrays.

14:36.743 --> 14:38.040
Fresh pineapples
are out of season,

14:38.177 --> 14:39.838
so we had to use the canned.

14:41.547 --> 14:44.175
Where is... Mrs. Cunningham?

14:44.317 --> 14:46.411
She went upstairs.

14:46.552 --> 14:49.214
Oh. You want I should take
the drink up to her?

14:49.355 --> 14:52.256
No. I think you
better leave it right here.

14:52.392 --> 14:56.056
Looks like it's gonna be
a long night.

I'm looking for a man

20:04.003 --> 20:06.301
Oh... Howard.

20:10.176 --> 20:11.041
You know something?

20:11.177 --> 20:12.042
Hmm?

20:12.178 --> 20:13.668
We may be "C"s by ourselves,

20:13.813 --> 20:16.339
-but together, we're an
- Mmm.

20:16.482 --> 20:19.679
Othen/vise, why would
our children and Arthur

20:19.819 --> 20:21.514
go to all this trouble
to give us

20:21.654 --> 20:25.522
this wonderful,
wonderful second honeymoon?

20:25.658 --> 20:28.025
Marion...

20:28.160 --> 20:30.891
I could have not put it
in better words myself.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.498
And you're right, Howard.

20:32.631 --> 20:34.690
You can't relive the past.

20:34.834 --> 20:35.733
Mmm.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.233
You know something?

20:37.369 --> 20:39.394
What are a couple
of "A"s like us

20:39.538 --> 20:41.506
doing in a "D" hotel?

20:41.640 --> 20:43.540
Let's go home, huh?

20:47.113 --> 20:50.708
POTSIE:
♪ Ooh... 'cause of you ♪

20:50.850 --> 20:53.182

21:06.766 --> 21:07.756
Thank you, thank you.

21:07.900 --> 21:08.890
I have an announcement to make.

21:09.034 --> 21:09.899
Good news!

21:10.035 --> 21:11.469
The broken pipe at Arnold's

21:11.604 --> 21:12.628
is not that bad.

21:12.772 --> 21:13.967
Gonna be able to get it fixed

21:14.106 --> 21:15.835
and Al's gonna be back
in business tomorrow.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.568
- G reat, great!
-(cheering)

21:17.710 --> 21:19.439
Well, just-just
don't forget that, uh,

21:19.578 --> 21:21.307
we're able to use this house

21:21.447 --> 21:24.109
due to the courtesy
of Mom and Dad,

21:24.250 --> 21:26.912
who've donated the premises
in absentia.

21:27.052 --> 21:28.577
(laughing)

21:28.721 --> 21:31.622
Mom and Dad are
on their second honeymoon.

21:31.757 --> 21:33.452
ALL:
Ooh!

21:33.592 --> 21:34.684
Yeah.

21:34.827 --> 21:36.090
Yeah, they didn't get it
right the first time.

21:36.228 --> 21:37.423
- Ha ha.
-(laughter)

21:37.563 --> 21:39.588
Even in the Annex,
I still got it.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.598
I have an announcement to make.

21:41.734 --> 21:43.828
Even though we're in the Annex,

21:43.969 --> 21:46.904
ah, the quality of my food
will not suffer.

21:47.039 --> 21:49.007
I want you to know that
all the Arnoldburgers

21:49.141 --> 21:51.371
will have that same taste
as always.

21:51.510 --> 21:53.706
- Ah...
- POTSIE: Hit it, guys!

21:53.846 --> 21:56.213
(playing rock music)

21:59.151 --> 22:00.016
(music continues)

22:00.152 --> 22:02.314
MARION:
Home sweet home, Howard.

22:02.454 --> 22:05.048
HOWARD:
What's <i>going</i> on in there?

22:10.863 --> 22:12.388
(music stops)

22:12.531 --> 22:13.464
All right!

22:13.599 --> 22:15.590
Thanks for the solo spot, guys.

22:18.370 --> 22:19.235
Cut it out.

22:19.371 --> 22:21.465
Well, thank you for the welcome.

22:21.607 --> 22:22.972
I'm overwhelmed!

22:23.108 --> 22:24.098
Marion...

22:28.948 --> 22:31.849
Richard, I'm sure there's
an explanation for this.

22:31.984 --> 22:33.145
Well, there is, there is.

22:33.285 --> 22:35.310
But, uh, man-to-man, Dad,

22:35.454 --> 22:36.853
how come you came home so
soon?

22:36.989 --> 22:38.855
Well, it's a long story,

22:38.991 --> 22:40.789
but a nice one,
right, Babycakes?

22:40.926 --> 22:43.088
Right, Snookums.

22:44.763 --> 22:47.460
You know how to play
"Moonlight in Vermont"?

22:47.600 --> 22:48.624
Yeah, sure we know it,

22:48.767 --> 22:50.166
but nobody wants
to hear that song.

22:50.302 --> 22:51.292
POTSIE:
Yeah, no one wants to hear that.

22:51.437 --> 22:53.428
FONZIE:
Hold it!

22:56.008 --> 22:57.498
This fabumondo couple

22:57.643 --> 22:58.940
is having
an anniversary tomorrow.

22:59.078 --> 23:01.547
It happens to be
one of my favorite tunes.

23:02.748 --> 23:04.011
Why don't you play them
their song, huh?

23:04.149 --> 23:05.913
- All right.
- All right.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.951
(playing "Moonlight in Vermont")

23:12.157 --> 23:14.216
Just a little anniversary humor.

23:14.360 --> 23:15.657
Take it away.

23:36.448 --> 23:37.472
Good-bye.

23:37.616 --> 23:39.448
We'll do it again
tomorrow night.

23:39.585 --> 23:40.575
Marion!

23:44.490 --> 23:45.685
Well, don't worry.

23:45.824 --> 23:46.882
We-we'll clean everything up
tomorrow, and uh...

23:47.026 --> 23:48.221
Yeah, we'll clean everything up.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.919
Happy anniversary.

23:50.062 --> 23:51.461
I hope you enjoyed your present.

23:51.597 --> 23:54.658
Oh, Holiday Shores
was just beautiful.

23:54.800 --> 23:55.926
Thanks again, kids.

23:56.068 --> 23:57.467
That's okay.

23:57.603 --> 24:00.766
Well, uh, see you in
the morning, Mr. Okay.

24:00.906 --> 24:02.840
Good night, Mrs. Average.

24:05.177 --> 24:06.110
BOTH:
We love you.

24:06.245 --> 24:08.077
Oh, good night.

24:12.484 --> 24:16.751
What are you thinking of
at a time like this, Snookums?

24:16.889 --> 24:19.415
Food, Marion.

24:19.558 --> 24:21.117
We haven't eaten yet, remember?

24:21.260 --> 24:22.386
MARION: Oh, that's right.

24:22.528 --> 24:24.929
Uh, do you have any more
Arnoldburgers in there, Al?

24:25.064 --> 24:28.034
Oh, gee, Howard, I'd like
to fix something up for you,

24:28.167 --> 24:29.692
but I got a late date.

24:29.835 --> 24:31.064
There's a lot of food
in the refrigerator,

24:31.203 --> 24:32.329
just help yourself.

24:32.471 --> 24:33.336
(doorbell rings)

24:33.472 --> 24:34.803
Oh, oh, that's probably her now.

24:34.940 --> 24:36.374
I told her to pick me up here.

24:36.508 --> 24:38.909
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:41.680 --> 24:43.045
I felt sorry for her.

24:43.182 --> 24:45.378
She never knows
what to say to men.

24:45.517 --> 24:47.042
