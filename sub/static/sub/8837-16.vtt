KEEP HER
IN BED FOR A

A POSSIBILITY OF
AN ERROR, CHARLES,

AS LONG AS YOU
KNOW WHAT IT IS,

12:00.010 --> 12:01.177

SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

WRONG, CAROLINE,

12:11.731 --> 12:13.356

HER TEMPERATURE

12:13.524 --> 12:15.191
WOULD DROP BACK
TO NORMAL,

12:15.359 --> 12:16.693
THE PAIN WOULD
GO AWAY.

HAPPENED.

DO NOW?

YOUR DR. BAKER
IS TO BE
COMMENDED.

HE WAS RIGHT TO
SEND YOUR MARY
TO US EARLY.

I KNOW THAT THERE'S
A FINANCIAL PROBLEM HERE,

38:03.072 --> 38:06.950
AND, WELL, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MY FEE.

38:07.118 --> 38:08.743
BUT I CAN'T PRACTICE
IN THIS HOSPITAL

38:08.911 --> 38:11.913
WITHOUT A CLEARANCE
FROM HORACE BENSON.

38:12.081 --> 38:13.957
I'LL TALK TO HIM
RIGHT NOW.
IS HE IN HIS OFFICE?

38:14.125 --> 38:15.834
YES, BUT...

38:16.002 --> 38:17.794
A WORD OF CAUTION.

38:17.962 --> 38:20.422
I'VE ALREADY TRIED
TO REASON WITH HIM.

38:20.589 --> 38:22.090
YEAH.

38:22.258 --> 38:24.509
WHY DON'T YOU STAY HERE
WITH DR. MAYES?

38:35.271 --> 38:38.440
MR. INGALLS,
THIS HOSPITAL
IS FOR PAYING PATIENTS.

38:38.607 --> 38:42.277
THIS WOULD HARDLY
COVER HER BILL.

38:42.445 --> 38:44.779
I KNOW THAT,
MR. BENSON.
THAT'S, UH...

38:44.947 --> 38:47.782
THAT'S WHY
I'M GIVING YOU
MY PERSONAL NOTE.

38:47.950 --> 38:49.784
I'M GOING TO GO HOME
AND SELL MY FARM,

38:49.952 --> 38:51.786
AND I'LL PAY
THAT BILL.

IT IS NOT THE POLICY

38:53.748 --> 38:56.708

TO EXTEND CREDIT.

38:56.876 --> 38:58.043
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT CREDIT.

39:12.016 --> 39:14.768
I'LL PAY YOU, MR. BENSON.
I SWEAR TO GOD I WILL.

39:16.937 --> 39:18.313
PLEASE.

39:37.166 --> 39:39.542
I'LL EXPECT PAYMENT
AT THE END OF THE MONTH,

OVERRULE THIS PAPER.

PAYMENT.
