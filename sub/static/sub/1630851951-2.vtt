you too, over here.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.387
- Cora, we don't need to get
in married people business.

08:09.490 --> 08:11.623
- Now, Mr. Brown! Come on!

08:11.725 --> 08:12.791
- Cora, why you yelling at me?

08:12.893 --> 08:15.861
- Come on over here.
You need to talk.

08:15.963 --> 08:18.363
- I thought we agreed that
he could not stay here, Jeremy!

08:18.465 --> 08:21.833
- No, no, technically,
you and Cora agreed

08:21.935 --> 08:23.068
that he can't stay here.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.703
But the money was just
too good to turn down.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.805
- What? Boy, he is over there
playing chess.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.540
You got my children
involved in this.

08:28.642 --> 08:29.941
- And y'all both know
better than that!

08:30.043 --> 08:31.510
- Cora, no, I don't!
- Yes, y'all do!

08:31.612 --> 08:33.011
- I don't know no better!

08:33.113 --> 08:36.214
I'm just doing what they daddy
said, so he know better, not me!

08:37.751 --> 08:40.285
- We both agreed that they need
to take on more responsibility.

08:40.387 --> 08:41.586
Right?
- Responsibility?

08:41.688 --> 08:42.954
- Look how much they enjoying
it.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.689
- It was six months in advance.

08:44.791 --> 08:46.491
- Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew!

08:46.593 --> 08:47.792
He had me cleaning his room,

08:47.895 --> 08:50.228
and something is alive
in the sock drawer.

08:50.330 --> 08:51.830
- VINNY: I told you,
if you don't bother it,

08:51.932 --> 08:53.932
it won't bother you!
Unplug it!

08:54.034 --> 08:55.367
- Uh uh, mm-mm, I'm done.

08:55.469 --> 08:57.135
Let's switch old people.
Come on.

08:57.237 --> 09:00.372
I said it's time to
switch old people.

09:03.443 --> 09:05.410
Come on, Mr. Reginald.
I'll show you to your room.

09:08.282 --> 09:10.148
- I gotta go get a handle
for Mr. Reginald's toilet.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.017
- Ooh, hold up, swole up,
where are you going?

09:12.119 --> 09:13.485
You gonna leave me
here with this mess.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.654
- Everything gonna be fine.
Relax!

09:15.756 --> 09:16.955
- [growls]

09:17.057 --> 09:19.090
- All this complaining about.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.525
- Whoo!
- Don't pay her no mind.

09:20.627 --> 09:22.327
- [bell rings]
- Hello!

09:22.429 --> 09:23.828
I'm Todd from the
Housing Department,

09:23.931 --> 09:25.397
here for your
surprise inspection.

09:25.499 --> 09:26.464
- Oh my god.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.133
- How you keep doing that?

09:28.235 --> 09:30.535
Every time you open the
door, somebody at the door.

09:30.637 --> 09:34.072
Quit opening the door!
- Oh my God.

09:36.610 --> 09:37.909
- ♪

09:38.011 --> 09:40.145
- Ain't nobody tell me about
no surprise inspection.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.914
- Ha! That's not how surprises
typically work.

09:43.016 --> 09:45.050
May I come in?

09:45.152 --> 09:47.218
- Yeah. You know what?

09:47.321 --> 09:49.721
We weren't really expecting you
for like three more months.

09:49.823 --> 09:52.691
- And here I am.
Would you look at that?

09:52.793 --> 09:53.825
- Yeah, imagine that!

09:53.927 --> 09:55.226
- [nervous laughter]

09:55.329 --> 09:56.861
- Can you excuse
me for a second?

09:56.964 --> 09:58.830
- Sure! I'll just need
to check the fire alarms

09:58.932 --> 09:59.831
and the extinguishers.

09:59.933 --> 10:03.068
- Yeah, it's outside.

10:03.170 --> 10:05.937
- I hope this was worth the
three months of rent in advance

10:06.039 --> 10:07.839
you were talkin' 'bout.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.141
- It was six months in advance.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.277
- [squealing] Damn!

10:12.379 --> 10:14.546
- Okay, look.
I know one thing.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.748
I'm not goin' no jail!

10:16.850 --> 10:19.417
I don't want nobody
braiding my hair!

10:19.519 --> 10:20.418
- Okay, look.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.420
Everybody just--
let's just take a breath.

10:22.522 --> 10:23.788
[inhales deeply]

10:23.890 --> 10:25.056
Okay, let it out.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.258
Now let's just try
to calm down, right?

10:27.361 --> 10:28.226
Calm down.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.328
Maybe we can just--
so, so maybe, um--

10:30.430 --> 10:34.466
we just need to not let
the inspector see Reginald.

10:34.568 --> 10:36.301
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, Jeremy?

10:36.403 --> 10:38.036
Have you got a minute?
- Ooh--

10:38.138 --> 10:39.270
- The bulb in
my ceiling fan blew

10:39.373 --> 10:41.106
when I turned on the hot water.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.008
- Yeah, man, I got it, go ahead.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.709
- LEAH: What we gonna do?

10:44.811 --> 10:46.044
- Okay, you know what?

10:46.146 --> 10:48.279
I'm starting to think that
this family is cursed, Cora.

10:48.382 --> 10:51.316
- CORA: I mean, yes--
- Was that your co-owner, Benny?

10:51.418 --> 10:53.752
- Huh?
- What you want? Who?

10:53.854 --> 10:55.687
- I'm Vinny.
Who the hell are you?

10:55.789 --> 10:57.389
- I'm the inspector.
- CORA: Oh!

10:57.491 --> 10:58.456
- Dang it.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.193
- [chuckles] That Vinny!

11:02.295 --> 11:04.029
- How many Vinnys reside here?

11:04.131 --> 11:06.898
- One.
- Two.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.333
- I'm confused.

11:08.435 --> 11:13.004
Um, I'm listed the residents
here as grandfather Vinny,

11:13.106 --> 11:16.474
Jeremy, wife Leah--
- That's me.

11:16.576 --> 11:17.409
- --daughter "Saendra"--

11:17.511 --> 11:19.911
- It's "Sahndra."
- --and son Philip?

11:20.013 --> 11:21.346
- Ooh, Cora, they
got all their names.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.415
They all about to go to prison.
The kids--

11:23.517 --> 11:26.618
- I'm also seeing a
Mr. Brown and Cora Brown

11:26.720 --> 11:29.087
as business partners?

11:29.189 --> 11:30.388
- Cora, who gave him my name?

11:30.490 --> 11:32.157
- Just calm down, Mr. Brown, hm?

11:32.259 --> 11:34.225
- I had to put everybody's
name on the application.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.895
- You snitch!
- Calm down!

11:36.997 --> 11:38.563
- Alrighty then!

11:38.665 --> 11:41.032
Is that gentleman needing
the light bulb, is he family?

11:41.134 --> 11:44.002
- Yeah, nephew, nephew.
- Uncle.

11:44.104 --> 11:48.239
Uncle Nephew.
- Right, right.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.375
I'm gonna go inspect
the exterior, okay?

11:50.477 --> 11:51.643
- Yeah.
- But I'm gonna come back

11:51.745 --> 11:53.244
and tour the house
and speak with the occupants.

11:53.346 --> 11:54.579
- Alright, we'll
see you in a moment.

11:54.681 --> 11:55.680
- Okay!

11:55.782 --> 11:57.215
- Y'all better be glad
I'm quick on my feet

11:57.317 --> 11:58.717
and I can think real fast.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.652
Otherwise, we would've
been going to jail right now.

12:00.754 --> 12:02.087
- What did you say that
helped the situation?

12:02.189 --> 12:03.455
- That was terrible!

12:03.557 --> 12:06.825
They're probably out there
calling the SWAT team right now.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.159
- Okay, Cora,
well, we better go.

12:08.261 --> 12:09.227
- Well, what are
you doing there?

12:09.329 --> 12:10.729
We just can't
leave them behind.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.263
- Yes, we can.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.599
- The worst they can do is give
us a little slap on the wrist.

12:14.701 --> 12:16.267
Right? Right, right?

12:16.369 --> 12:19.504
- Baby, white people
get slaps on the wrist.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.940
Rich people get
slaps on the wrist.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.742
We broke and Black as hell.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.210
- [whimpers]

12:25.312 --> 12:27.812
- Well, we can kiss
our wrists goodbye.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.380
- All we gotta do--
- Huh?

12:29.483 --> 12:32.851
- --is pass off Reginald
as Uncle Nephew,

12:32.953 --> 12:35.353
and then we gonna get our
certificate of occupancy, okay?

12:35.455 --> 12:37.655
- You do realize every time
you say something like that,

12:37.758 --> 12:39.457
the exact opposite happens?

12:41.128 --> 12:43.595
- Facts.
- Every single time!

12:43.697 --> 12:45.697
- Baby--
- Oh, I'm sorry.

12:45.799 --> 12:46.698
- You gonna be that loud?

12:46.800 --> 12:48.066
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, baby.

12:49.035 --> 12:50.835
- Roofing looks fine, check.

12:50.937 --> 12:55.039
- That's good, that's good.
- Plumbing is good, check.

12:55.142 --> 12:59.377
Electrical's in
decent shape, check.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.513
I'll just need to ask a few
questions about the dynamic of

13:01.615 --> 13:03.581
the family here and
then I'll be on my way.

13:03.683 --> 13:05.850
- Okay, I'd like the
record to reflect--

13:05.952 --> 13:07.585
- What?

13:07.687 --> 13:10.155
- --that I was denied
the right to an attorney.

13:10.257 --> 13:11.322
- What are you talking about?

13:11.424 --> 13:13.925
- [sighs] For the
last time, Vincent,

13:14.027 --> 13:16.294
this is not a
criminal interrogation.

13:16.396 --> 13:19.164
There is no record, and
thus no need for an attorney.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.599
- See? That's what they'd like
you to believe.

13:21.701 --> 13:24.202
Then they lock you up.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.538
- Will Uncle Nephew
be joining us?

13:26.640 --> 13:29.207
- You know what? Earlier he said
he wasn't feeling well.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.643
- Yeah, yeah.
- I feel terrific.

13:31.745 --> 13:35.146
I think I'm gonna take a walk
and check out the neighborhood.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.414
- See? Just what I said.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.817
The exact opposite.
Y'all cursed.

13:38.919 --> 13:39.951
- Yep.

13:40.053 --> 13:42.387
- Uncle Nephew!
Please, come join us.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.621
- Who?

13:43.723 --> 13:46.124
- No, no, he don't have to join.
Just talk to us, man.

13:46.226 --> 13:47.692
- Well, you know, guys,
I would like to interview

13:47.794 --> 13:50.195
the whole family
as well as the owners.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.330
- Well, neither of those
pertain to me, so--

13:52.432 --> 13:54.833
- Ah, ah, Uncle Tom--Uncle
Nephew be trying to act like

13:54.935 --> 13:56.034
he not with us.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.202
Yeah, he ain't
took his medicine,

13:57.304 --> 13:59.103
so he mucho loco right now.

13:59.206 --> 14:02.340
- Who and what is Uncle Nephew?

14:02.442 --> 14:04.442
- Come on, Reggie, man, stop
tripping, man,

14:04.544 --> 14:06.945
you know--
- It's Reginald.

14:07.047 --> 14:10.248
- So, you are not Uncle Nephew?

14:10.350 --> 14:12.483
- What is going on here?

14:12.586 --> 14:13.818
- I can explain.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.921
- Well, I'm glad you can, 'cuz
I ain't got nothin' right now.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.723
- There is nothing to explain.

14:18.825 --> 14:20.959
You were trying to pass
this man off as a relative

14:21.061 --> 14:23.127
when clearly, he's a tenant,

14:23.230 --> 14:26.698
which, legally,
you're not supposed to have.

14:26.800 --> 14:30.001
- That about sums it up.

14:30.103 --> 14:33.771
- I can assure you this will
all be going in my report

14:33.874 --> 14:35.874

shenanigans you got goin' on

be a part of it.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.582

first thing in the morning.

when he left last night.

I don't think we're going to be
hearing from him again.

What did you do?

15:41.474 --> 15:42.740

money and dumped his body.

something stupid like that now?

15:48.214 --> 15:49.414
- Yeah.

and plastic in your car.

has murdered Mr. Reginald, okay?

Pleasant Days just
wasn't a good fit.

But I can't talk about
it right now, alright?

16:23.850 --> 16:25.450
Nothing I can do about it.
I'll talk to y'all later.

16:25.552 --> 16:26.718
Going downtown.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.453
- Why are you going
to the door again?

16:28.555 --> 16:30.488
Stay away from the door!

16:32.058 --> 16:33.558
- [bell rings]

16:33.660 --> 16:35.159
- See? I told you,
don't open the door.

16:35.261 --> 16:37.762
Every time you go to the door,
like I said, people show up.

16:37.864 --> 16:40.465
Now you gonna
send us all to jail.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.333
- Reginald. Inspector.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.769
- May we come in?
- Please.

16:44.871 --> 16:47.305
- MR. BROWN: I couldn't see him
'cuz he was behind the counter.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.473
- Oh my lord!

16:48.575 --> 16:52.076
- Um, gentlemen, um,
actually--actually,

16:52.178 --> 16:53.311
really glad that you're here

16:53.413 --> 16:56.381
because I was just
coming downtown to see you.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.850
I want to apologize for
what happened yesterday.

16:58.952 --> 17:02.653
You know, um, I really
wasn't trying to deceive you.

17:02.756 --> 17:04.589
- I really appreciate
that apology.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.257
- No, no, he was talking to him

17:06.359 --> 17:09.227
'cuz we was definitely
trying to deceive you.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.763
- All day long!

17:11.865 --> 17:12.563
- Come on.

17:12.665 --> 17:13.865
- Okie-dokie, pokey.

17:13.967 --> 17:16.334
Let's just get this
over with, shall we?

17:16.436 --> 17:18.970
Here is your certificate
of occupancy.

17:19.072 --> 17:20.538
- What!
- Oh, man.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.607
- How did that happen?
- Hold on.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.542
- Well, I was in the middle
of writing up my report

17:24.644 --> 17:26.711
to deny your permit
based on the grounds

17:26.813 --> 17:28.780
of illegally having a tenant

17:28.882 --> 17:30.381
when the judge stopped
by my office to explain

17:30.483 --> 17:33.251
that he wasn't a tenant.

17:33.353 --> 17:36.087
- Mr. Reginald, you're a judge?
- A judge?

17:36.189 --> 17:38.022
- Retired.

17:38.124 --> 17:41.359
- Wait a minute.
You Judge Junie?

17:41.461 --> 17:43.561
- You know, I thought
you looked familiar.

17:43.663 --> 17:49.267
You locked me up in 1983 in
Augusta on a counterfeit charge

17:49.369 --> 17:51.803
for selling some
fake Thriller jackets.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.638
It's a shame what that
sun did to them jackets.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.874
It's like soup, it was sad.
Very sad.

17:56.976 --> 17:58.376
- I don't understand.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.078
You were a tenant.
You signed the lease.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.980
- I did, but this morning I
was looking at the lease,

18:03.083 --> 18:08.186
and I realized that you
downloaded a CA instead of a GA.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.254
And since that lease was
for the state of California,

18:10.356 --> 18:13.257
I was never your tenant
on this property.

18:13.359 --> 18:15.126
- Wow.
- Yes!

18:15.228 --> 18:17.361
- Congratulations, fam.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.530
You are officially
open for business--

18:19.632 --> 18:22.767
or whatever it is
you got going on up in here.

18:22.869 --> 18:25.036
- Thank you, Mr. Inspector!
- Thank you, Inspector.

18:25.138 --> 18:26.471
- Don't mention it.

18:26.573 --> 18:29.040
Seriously, don't mention it.

18:29.142 --> 18:29.874
- Thank you, white man!

18:29.976 --> 18:31.409
- And if it's not
too much to ask,

18:31.511 --> 18:32.910
I'd like to have
my old room back.

18:33.012 --> 18:35.079
- Okay, Mr. Reginald,
I have to ask.

18:35.181 --> 18:36.347
Why the change of heart?

18:36.449 --> 18:38.816
- My wife and I
divorced in our 40's

18:38.918 --> 18:40.084
and we never had any children.

18:40.186 --> 18:42.553
So for the last 30 years,

18:42.655 --> 18:45.456
I've been completely
focused on my job.

18:45.558 --> 18:49.727
And yesterday, for the
first time in a long while,

18:49.829 --> 18:54.732
I experienced what it was like
to be with a family again.

18:54.834 --> 18:59.437
A--A highly dysfunctional one.

18:59.539 --> 19:00.605
- Here.
- Here.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.907
- And slightly psychotic.

19:03.009 --> 19:04.308
- [agreeing]

19:04.410 --> 19:06.711
- But a family nonetheless.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.813
- Welcome home, Mr. Reginald.

19:08.915 --> 19:10.481
- You know what, Mr. Reggie?

19:10.583 --> 19:11.983
You're about to make me cry!

19:13.586 --> 19:14.919
- Mr. Reginald.

19:15.021 --> 19:15.987
- Can I hug you?

19:16.089 --> 19:17.188
- Yeah, bring it on, baby.

19:17.290 --> 19:18.456
- [cries]

19:18.558 --> 19:19.790
- LEAH: Aww, look at that!

19:22.328 --> 19:23.628
- [indistinct chatter]

19:23.730 --> 19:26.364
- Oh man, I'm so
glad y'all here.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.065
In front of the whole family--

19:28.168 --> 19:29.700
- [laughter]

19:29.802 --> 19:31.269
- CORA: You're bearing gifts?
- Yeah, you know it.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.837
You know how I do.
Here you go, baby.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.205
There's your makeup.
- Thanks, Daddy.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.273
- JEREMY: You're
welcome, sweetie.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.474
And the big one?

19:36.576 --> 19:38.376
- [indistinct chatter]
- [laughs]

19:38.478 --> 19:40.745
Ah, ta-da!

19:40.847 --> 19:42.713
- What--what--what is this?

19:42.815 --> 19:44.415
- You know what it is.
You know better.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.918
- This is my Zoltron 4
and the original Zoltron.

19:47.020 --> 19:50.087
- Zoltron 4 plus
Zoltron 1 make what, y'all?

19:50.190 --> 19:51.689
- ALL: Five.

19:51.791 --> 19:54.959
- It looks like 5 to me, 5.
- I shoulda asked for a 8.

19:55.061 --> 19:55.993
It's not cool.

19:56.095 --> 19:58.162
- Aw, man, I feel so bad.

19:58.264 --> 19:59.463
- [laughs]

19:59.566 --> 20:01.666
- Look, uh, Mr. Reginald,
thank you so much, man.

20:01.768 --> 20:03.367
You really came through for us.

20:03.469 --> 20:04.602
We appreciate him, right?

20:04.704 --> 20:06.003
- Surely my pleasure.

20:06.105 --> 20:10.374
I really didn't care for
his ostentatious behavior.

20:10.476 --> 20:13.978
- [laughs] So he
was a eye doctor!

20:14.080 --> 20:15.346
- No, dummy.

20:15.448 --> 20:16.914
That's optometrist.

20:17.016 --> 20:20.885
Ostentatious is a
British spy, fool.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.853
- No, no, no, that's
Austin Powers.

20:22.956 --> 20:24.822
Ostentatious is that
brand of hot dogs.

20:24.924 --> 20:27.191
- Oscar Meyer.

20:27.293 --> 20:30.261
Ostentatious is the
truck from "Transformers."

20:30.363 --> 20:32.263
Everybody know that.

20:32.365 --> 20:34.966
- That's Optimus Prime, silly.

20:35.068 --> 20:37.535
Ostentatious is
the capital of Texas.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.403
- Uh uh, baby.
No, no, no, no.

20:39.505 --> 20:41.172
That is Austin, Texas.

20:41.274 --> 20:44.542
Ostentatious is that
song by The Gap Band, baby!

20:44.644 --> 20:47.345
- No, ma'am, that's
"Outstanding" by The Gap Band.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.046
- So, what's "ostenatious"?

20:49.148 --> 20:51.249
- ♪

20:53.620 --> 20:54.218
- ♪

20:55.888 --> 20:58.889
- ♪
