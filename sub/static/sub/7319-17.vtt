00:11.900 --> 00:13.367
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:13.400 --> 00:15.600
I RAISED YOU TO BE
AN EXTRAORDINARY HUMAN BEING.

00:15.633 --> 00:18.133
IMAGINE MY DISAPPOINTMENT
WHEN I WAKE UP AFTER FIVE YEARS

00:18.167 --> 00:20.133
AND DISCOVER THAT YOU'RE
NO MORE THAN ORDINARY.

00:20.167 --> 00:23.067
AN HOUR AGO, HE WAS PROPOSING.
NOW HE'S GOING TO THE MORGUE.

00:23.100 --> 00:28.733
YOU DID GOOD.

00:28.767 --> 00:31.667
DO YOU BELIEVE IN HEAVEN?

00:33.500 --> 00:36.467
(Meredith) THERE ARE
MEDICAL MIRACLES.

00:36.500 --> 00:40.033
BEING WORSHIPPERS
AT THE ALTAR OF SCIENCE,

00:40.067 --> 00:42.833
WE DON'T LIKE TO BELIEVE
MIRACLES EXIST.

00:42.867 --> 00:44.333
BUT THEY DO.

00:44.367 --> 00:46.267
***

00:46.300 --> 00:48.600
THINGS HAPPEN.

00:48.633 --> 00:50.533
WE CAN'T EXPLAIN THEM,

00:50.567 --> 00:52.667
WE CAN'T CONTROL THEM...

00:52.700 --> 00:54.600
BUT THEY DO HAPPEN.

00:54.633 --> 00:57.500
CHIEF, I KNOW THE HYPOTHERMIA IS
PROTECTIVE TO HER VITAL ORGANS,

00:57.533 --> 01:00.500
HOW MUCH LONGER DO YOU THINK
WE CAN GO ON LIKE THIS?

01:00.533 --> 01:03.267
I'VE SEEN PEOPLE LAST
AS LONG AS FOUR HOURS.
YEAH, BUT YOU--

01:03.300 --> 01:05.467
NO, THIS IS NOT--THIS IS
ELLIS GREY'S LITTLE GIRL.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.400
(Preston) WE'RE ALL
ON THE SAME--
THIS IS MY--

01:07.433 --> 01:09.600
WE'RE ALL ON
THE SAME SIDE HERE, CHIEF.

01:09.633 --> 01:11.333
SIR...

01:11.367 --> 01:14.600
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

01:14.633 --> 01:16.533
HER BODY TEMP
IS AT 86 DEGREES.

01:16.567 --> 01:18.700
SHE IS NOT DEAD
UNTIL SHE IS WARM AND DEAD.

01:18.733 --> 01:21.600
WE NEED TO WARM HER UP TO 98.6
AND START HER HEART.

01:21.633 --> 01:23.267
YES, SIR.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.833
LET'S DO A GASTRIC LAVAGE
WITH WARM FLUIDS.

01:25.867 --> 01:29.700
***

01:29.733 --> 01:32.667
(pager beeps)

01:32.700 --> 01:36.100
ADDISON.
I HAVE TO GO. I--
IT'S MY JANE DOE.

01:36.133 --> 01:38.500
JUST--THEY'RE WAITING...
FOR YOU.

01:38.533 --> 01:42.067
SO WHATEVER
YOU CHOOSE TO SAY WILL...

01:42.100 --> 01:44.733
(tone continues)

01:44.767 --> 01:46.700
***

01:51.200 --> 01:54.067
THEY HAPPEN EVERY DAY.

01:54.067 --> 01:57.533
JUST NOT ALWAYS
WHEN WE NEED THEM TO HAPPEN.

01:57.567 --> 02:00.467
***

02:06.333 --> 02:09.733
***

02:11.300 --> 02:13.333
MEREDITH?

02:13.367 --> 02:15.267
SHE'S FREAKING OUT.
SHE'S NOT FREAKING OUT.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.200
PEOPLE TEND TO FREAK OUT.
TRUST ME, SHE'S FINE.

02:17.233 --> 02:19.367
OH, OKAY, MR. I BEEN
DEAD LONGER, KNOWS EVERYTHING.

02:19.400 --> 02:22.467
YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S WHY I
DON'T LIKE TO BE HERE WITH YOU,

02:22.500 --> 02:24.367
BECAUSE YOU DON'T ASSESS
THE SITUATION.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.567
YOU JUST DIVE RIGHT IN.
OH, I'M NOT THE ONE WHO GOT
HIMSELF ALL BLOWN UP.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.333
ALL RIGHT,
YOU WANNA DO THIS NOW

02:28.367 --> 02:30.067
OR YOU WANNA DO THIS LATER?
OH, I-I WANNA DO THIS NOW.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.700
YOU WANNA DO THIS NOW?
I WILL KICK YOUR ASS ANYTIME.
I'M THE ONE WITH A FRESH HEART.

02:32.733 --> 02:35.200
OH, YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA
KICK MY--
THIS IS THE BRAIN THING.

02:35.233 --> 02:38.700
THIS IS THE KETAMINE/
NEUROTRANSMITTER THING, RIGHT?
(Denny and Dylan) NO.

02:38.733 --> 02:41.067
'CAUSE YOU'D THINK IF THIS WERE
MY BRAIN DOING THIS,

02:41.067 --> 02:44.633
THE FIRST PERSON I'D WANT
TO SEE, NO OFFENSE, WOULD BE...

02:44.667 --> 02:47.733
DOC! WHAT A GOOD BOY.

02:47.767 --> 02:48.700
(sighs)

02:48.733 --> 02:50.500
HI.

02:50.533 --> 02:51.700
HI, BUDDY.

02:51.733 --> 02:54.167
MEREDITH.

02:54.200 --> 02:56.400
THIS IS NOT
YOUR BRAIN ON DRUGS.

02:56.433 --> 02:57.633
THIS IS DEATH.

02:57.667 --> 02:59.800
YOU ARE DEAD.
YOU'RE REALLY FREAKIN' DEAD.

02:59.833 --> 03:02.067
YOU'RE DIRT-NAP DEAD.
NO-MORE-YOU DEAD.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

03:02.067 --> 03:03.400
WHOA. WAY TOO HARSH.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.567
REMEMBER, WE--
WE'RE GONNA TAKE IT EASY.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.200
THAT WAS NOT EASY.

03:07.233 --> 03:11.433
(sighs)

03:11.467 --> 03:13.333
MEREDITH...

03:13.367 --> 03:14.700
YOU DROWNED...

03:14.733 --> 03:16.367
IN ELLIOTT BAY.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.667
YOU REMEMBER THAT?
YEAH, THAT SUCKED.

03:18.700 --> 03:21.400
WHO'S A GOOD BOY?
WHO'S THE BEST DOG?

03:21.433 --> 03:23.300
OH, THIS IS
GONNA TAKE A WHILE.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.667
WHO'S THE BEST DOG?
WHO'S SUCH A GOOD BOY?
(sighs)
WE DON'T HAVE A WHILE.

03:25.700 --> 03:27.567
SHE'S RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.567
WHO'S THE BEST DOG?

03:31.733 --> 03:33.367
TELL ME.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.667
HER TEMP'S STILL ONLY 86.
THERE'S STILL NO HEARTBEAT.

03:35.700 --> 03:37.600
WE'RE HOPING
ONCE SHE WARMS UP--
I WANT TO GO IN THERE.

03:37.633 --> 03:39.767
NO.
THERE'S A RISK OF BRAIN DAMAGE.
I NEED TO GO IN THERE.

03:39.800 --> 03:42.400
I'M GOING IN.
DEREK, YOU CAN'T, NOT FOR
MEREDITH, NOT FOR ANYBODY.

03:42.433 --> 03:45.067
YOU'RE IN NO SHAPE.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.500
(sighs)

03:46.533 --> 03:48.200
IT'S NOT GOOD.

03:48.233 --> 03:50.100
IS SHE STILL CYANOTIC?
WHAT WAS HER INITIAL TEMP?

03:50.133 --> 03:52.067
I MEAN,
WHAT IS TAKING SO LONG?

03:52.067 --> 03:53.800
DR. YANG...
IT'S NOT GOOD.

03:53.833 --> 03:55.733
THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING
THEY CAN.

03:55.767 --> 03:57.100
I...

03:57.133 --> 03:59.433
YOU SHOULD MAYBE, UM,

03:59.467 --> 04:02.767
PREPARE YOURSELVES.

04:02.800 --> 04:05.133
I HAVE TO GO.
UH, MY JANE DOE'S AWAKE.

04:05.167 --> 04:08.167
I'M COMING WITH YOU.
IZ, YOU'LL LET US KNOW?

04:08.200 --> 04:10.167
PREPARE OURSELVES?
THAT'S...

04:10.200 --> 04:12.800
THAT'S WHAT WE TELL THE FAMILIES
BEFORE WE CALL TIME OF DEATH.

04:12.833 --> 04:15.700
SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY.
SOMETIMES YOU'RE WRONG.

04:19.100 --> 04:21.633
UNH-UNH. NO.

04:21.667 --> 04:23.500
CRISTINA--
I AM NOT DOING THIS.

04:23.533 --> 04:25.200
CRISTINA.

04:29.267 --> 04:31.267
(sighs)

04:31.300 --> 04:33.833
SHE'S GONNA SURVIVE THIS.

04:33.867 --> 04:36.067
SHE'S GONNA SURVIVE THIS.
SHE'S GONNA SURVIVE THIS.

04:36.100 --> 04:38.233
SHE'S GONNA SURVIVE THIS.
SHE'S GONNA SURVIVE--

04:38.267 --> 04:39.600
(bell tolling)

04:39.633 --> 04:42.433
(woman) MEREDITH. MEREDITH.

04:42.467 --> 04:44.367
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU REMEMBER ME.

04:44.400 --> 04:47.233
I WAS
YOUR MOTHER'S SCRUB NURSE.

04:47.267 --> 04:49.233
I DIED FROM--
LIVER CANCER.

04:50.733 --> 04:52.067
BONNIE?

04:52.067 --> 04:53.800
SHE REMEMBERS ME.
YOU REMEMBER.

04:53.833 --> 04:57.267
YOU WERE A VERY IMPORTANT
PATIENT FOR HER.

04:57.300 --> 04:59.233
WHAT ARE ALL OF YOU
DOING HERE? IS THIS--

04:59.267 --> 05:01.267
IT'S NOT HEAVEN.
WE'RE HERE
BECAUSE YOU CALLED US HERE.

05:01.300 --> 05:03.233
I DIDN'T. DID I?

05:03.267 --> 05:05.600
TELL US ABOUT THE WATER,
MEREDITH.

05:09.500 --> 05:12.233
YOU DO NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY
TO SPEAK TO ME IN THAT WAY.

05:12.267 --> 05:14.367
YOU ARE A BUG.
YOU UNDERSTAND?
I NEED YOU TO HOLD STILL!

05:14.400 --> 05:17.833
HEY, HEY. GO AHEAD.
BURKE USUALLY WRITES FOR
LORAZEPAM WHEN SHE'S LIKE THIS,

05:17.867 --> 05:20.067
AMATEURS!
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO BOTHER HIM.

05:20.100 --> 05:21.800
LET ME OUT OF THIS BED.
DO IT. GIVE IT TO HER.

05:21.833 --> 05:24.167
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
THIS IS A DAY
SHE SHOULD SLEEP THROUGH.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.067
DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING? GET ME RICHARD!

05:26.100 --> 05:27.833
I'M DR. MONTGOMERY.
YOU NEED THIS OXYGEN.

05:27.867 --> 05:31.233
I NEED YOU TO LIE BACK.
NO. I'M NOT--
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

05:31.267 --> 05:33.167
THIS WASN'T IN YOUR PLAN TODAY.
I GET THAT.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.100
BUT WE'RE TRYING
TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR BABY.

05:35.133 --> 05:38.067
(whimpers)
OKAY. NOW I NEED YOU
TO CALM DOWN.

05:38.100 --> 05:40.800
JUST--JUST TELL HER
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE ME HOME.

05:40.833 --> 05:43.200
JUST--JUST TALK TO MY HUSBAND.

05:43.233 --> 05:47.167
TH-THIS IS DR. KAREV.
HE'S MY INTERN.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.700
YOU'RE NOT? NO, YOU'RE--

05:48.733 --> 05:50.400
YOU LOST YOUR I.D.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.533
WE DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOUR FAMILY IS YET.

05:52.567 --> 05:55.667
BUT I-I KNOW YOU.
YOU'RE MY--
NO, I FOUND YOU ON THE DOCK
AFTER THE ACCIDENT.

05:55.700 --> 05:58.200
WHAT DOCK?
WHAT ACCIDENT? WHAT HAPPENED?

05:58.233 --> 06:00.567
YOU WERE ON THE FERRY.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.833
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

06:02.867 --> 06:04.300
(whimpers) NO.

06:04.333 --> 06:05.467
WHAT ABOUT YOUR NAME?

06:05.500 --> 06:08.633
(sobs) MY NAME?

06:08.667 --> 06:10.067
(sobs)
SHH.

06:10.067 --> 06:11.733
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M HAVING A BABY.

06:11.767 --> 06:13.733
SHH.
I SHOULD KNOW MY OWN NAME.

06:13.767 --> 06:16.700
SHH.
I'M HAVING A BABY.
I SHOULD KNOW MY OWN NAME.

06:16.733 --> 06:19.167
SHE CAN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING
FROM BEFORE THE ACCIDENT.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.533
IT COULD BE HEAD TRAUMA.

06:20.567 --> 06:22.467
IT COULD BE PSYCHOLOGICAL
FROM THE SHOCK.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.400
I MEAN, RETROGRADE AMNESIA--

06:24.433 --> 06:26.200
IT COULD BE
JUST TRANSIENT, RIGHT?

06:26.233 --> 06:28.133
WELL, THAT'S THE HOPE,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

06:28.167 --> 06:30.100
I'M WORRIED
ABOUT HER LUNGS, TOO.

06:30.133 --> 06:31.700
GET A CHEST X-RAY
AND AN A.B.G.
OKAY.

06:31.733 --> 06:34.500
HEY, ARE YOU OKAY? YOU WANT
TO BE WITH YOUR FRIENDS?

06:34.533 --> 06:36.133
NO, I'M--I'M ON THIS.

06:36.167 --> 06:37.400
YOU SURE?

06:37.433 --> 06:40.367
YEAH, IT'S JUST, I DON'T KNOW,
MEREDITH ALWAYS MAKES ME THINK--

06:40.400 --> 06:42.433
I DON'T KNOW,
SCREWED UP PEOPLE HAVE A CHANCE.

06:42.467 --> 06:44.233
(Richard) I'M IN.

06:44.267 --> 06:47.067
START THE WARM FLUIDS.
HOLD C.P.R.

06:47.067 --> 06:50.500
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

06:50.533 --> 06:52.700
ANYTHING?

06:52.733 --> 06:54.233
HER HEART IS STILL.

06:54.267 --> 06:57.500
NO MOVEMENT,
NO FIBRILLATION.

06:57.533 --> 06:58.700
NOTHING?

06:58.733 --> 07:00.467
NOTHING.

07:00.500 --> 07:03.067
RESTARTING C.P.R.

07:03.067 --> 07:04.300
(tone continues)

07:04.333 --> 07:05.733
STEVENS, GET OUT OF HERE.

07:05.767 --> 07:10.067
I JUST... OH, MY GOD.

07:10.100 --> 07:12.233
GO BACK OUTSIDE AND WAIT
WITH YANG AND O'MALLEY.

07:12.267 --> 07:15.667
CR-CRISTINA ISN'T, UM,
SHE LEFT.

07:15.700 --> 07:18.067
SHE LEFT IN THE MIDDLE OF
HER SHIFT? WHERE DID SHE GO?

07:33.600 --> 07:35.500
(bell tolls)

07:35.533 --> 07:37.667
MEREDITH, I NEED YOU
TO UNDERSTAND.

07:37.700 --> 07:40.067
THIS IS IMPORTANT.
YOU CAN'T SCREW AROUND.
DOC?

07:40.067 --> 07:42.533
ALL RIGHT?
THERE'S NO TIME FOR THAT.

07:42.567 --> 07:45.433
YOU DON'T HAVE THE TIME,
AND WE DON'T HAVE THE TIME.
I DROWNED. THAT'S ALL.
I DROWNED.

07:45.467 --> 07:48.067
MEREDITH, PLEASE LISTEN TO US.
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO US.

07:48.067 --> 07:49.400
YOU HAVE TO!

07:49.433 --> 07:51.800
OH, NO.

07:54.467 --> 07:56.067
(grunts)

07:56.067 --> 07:58.067
(groaning)

08:07.100 --> 08:10.433
(bell tolling)
I CAN'T FIND THE SOURCE
OF THIS BLEEDING!

08:10.467 --> 08:13.100
I NEED GLOVES
AND SURGICAL TOWELS.

08:13.133 --> 08:15.233
IT HAPPENS WITH BONNIE, BABY.
YOU JUST GOTTA RIDE IT.

08:15.267 --> 08:18.667
I CAN SAVE HER.
I CAN START AN I.V.
THERE'S NO POINT.

08:18.700 --> 08:22.133
GO TO THE O.R. AND GET ME
STERILIZED SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS.

08:22.167 --> 08:25.467
GO. GO!

08:32.867 --> 08:34.733
MEREDITH...

08:34.767 --> 08:37.633
ARE YOU READY
TO TALK ABOUT THIS NOW,

08:37.667 --> 08:40.433
OR YOU WANNA WASTE
SOME MORE TIME?

08:42.200 --> 08:43.533
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

08:43.567 --> 08:46.767
(Miranda) IT'S BEEN OVER
AN HOUR. THERE'S A CH--

08:46.800 --> 08:49.300
WE NEED TO PREPARE FOR
THE POSSIBILITY THAT SHE MAY--

08:49.333 --> 08:51.200
LOOK, SHE IS YOUNG,
SHE IS HEALTHY,

08:51.233 --> 08:53.533
HER TEMP'S GOING UP,
AND IT'S GONNA KEEP GOING UP

08:53.567 --> 08:55.467
AND HER HEART WILL START AGAIN.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.333
THAT'S THE ONLY POSSIBILITY
I'M PREPARED FOR.

08:58.367 --> 09:01.200
MM. DO YOU USE MOISTURIZER?

09:01.233 --> 09:04.267
HERE. TAKE THIS.
KEEP IT BEHIND THE BAR.

09:04.300 --> 09:05.633
(sniffs) WOW. WHAT IS THIS?

09:05.667 --> 09:08.233
IT SMELLS LIKE
SOMETHING BURNING.
IT'S GINGERBREAD.

09:08.267 --> 09:11.267
(laughs) YEAH.
YOU'RE NOT GETTING THIS,
ARE YOU?

09:11.300 --> 09:13.200
OKAY, THIS IS 99 CENTS.
OKAY?

09:13.233 --> 09:15.300
YOU CAN BUY ANYTHING
FOR 99 CENTS.

09:15.333 --> 09:17.267
OH! OKAY.

09:17.300 --> 09:18.600
OH.

09:20.200 --> 09:23.300
IT'S SMALL.
IT'S, UM, A TINY SIZE.

09:23.333 --> 09:25.233
IT HAS, UH,
CAT-TYPE CREATURES ON IT.

09:25.267 --> 09:26.467
BUT IT IS A CHAIR.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.400
FOR 99 CENTS,
YOU CAN BUY FURNITURE.

09:28.433 --> 09:31.400
THAT IS AMERICA, MAN.
THAT'S TAIWAN, MAN.

09:31.433 --> 09:33.833
YOU KNOW,
THIS FERRY THING'S PRETTY BAD.

09:33.867 --> 09:35.767
DON'T YOU THINK
YOU SHOULD BE--

09:35.800 --> 09:39.067
I AM COPING.

09:39.067 --> 09:40.733
OKAY?

09:43.100 --> 09:44.600
I'M COPING.

09:44.633 --> 09:46.300
SO, UH, SHUT UP

09:46.333 --> 09:48.700
AND, UH,
LOOK AT ALL MY CRAP!

09:51.633 --> 09:54.400
UH, CALLIE, I'M PUTTING YOU
IN CHARGE OF MY INTERNS.

09:54.433 --> 09:56.067
PUT 'EM TO WORK
ANYWHERE BUT HERE.

09:56.067 --> 09:59.600
DR. BAILEY, PLEASE LET US
STAY HERE.
NO, WE CAN'T GO ANYWHERE.
WE HAVE TO--

09:59.633 --> 10:01.300
YOU'RE CONCERNED.
I UNDERSTAND.

10:01.333 --> 10:03.667
THERE'S BEEN A DISASTER
AND THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE.

10:03.700 --> 10:06.100
GO, NOW.
ALL RIGHT, THEY NEED
BODIES DOWN IN THE CLINIC.

10:06.133 --> 10:07.467
LET'S GO DOWN THERE.

10:07.500 --> 10:08.833
HEY, BAILEY'S RIGHT.
WE CAN'T HELP MEREDITH.

10:08.867 --> 10:11.200
ALL WE CAN DO IS SIT AROUND
AND GO CRAZY.

10:11.233 --> 10:14.067
I-I CAN'T. I NEED TO BE HERE.
IZZIE, WE'RE ALL FREAKED.

10:14.100 --> 10:16.200
WE JUST NEED TO STAY
OUT OF THE WAY. GOT IT?

10:16.233 --> 10:19.100
LET'S GO.

10:19.133 --> 10:22.667
DO YOU OR YOUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY
HAVE A HISTORY OF CANCER?

10:22.700 --> 10:24.567
UM, I DON'T KNOW.

10:24.600 --> 10:27.067
HOW ABOUT HEART DISEASE
OR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE?

10:27.100 --> 10:29.500
(scoffs)
HOW ABOUT ALCOHOL
OR DRUG USE?

10:29.533 --> 10:31.433
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANY OF THIS, DO YOU?

10:31.467 --> 10:34.333
I DON'T EVEN KNOW THE SEX
OF MY BABY OR IF I'M MARRIED.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.267
I MEAN, I...
I HAVE A RING LINE,

10:36.300 --> 10:38.200
BUT I DON'T HAVE THE RING.

10:38.233 --> 10:40.200
SO WHAT DOES THAT MAKE ME?

10:40.233 --> 10:42.367
I-I DON'T KNOW.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.233
IS IT REALLY BAD?

10:45.267 --> 10:47.300
YOU LOOK... I MEAN,
AM I GONNA...

10:47.333 --> 10:49.200
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

10:49.233 --> 10:52.533
IT'S, UH... IT'S A FRIEND.
SHE WAS IN THE ACCIDENT, TOO.

10:52.567 --> 10:54.533
OH, I'M SORRY.

10:54.567 --> 10:56.600
YEAH. WELL...

10:56.633 --> 11:00.067
THINGS ARE TOUGH ALL OVER.

11:00.067 --> 11:02.767
I HAVE NO NEW INFORMATION ABOUT
YOUR LOVED ONES. I'M SORRY.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.700
BUT WE ARE FACING
A SERIOUS BLOOD SHORTAGE.

11:04.733 --> 11:07.600
SO ANYONE ELIGIBLE TO
DONATE BLOOD SHOULD SEE ME.

11:07.633 --> 11:10.167
IF YOU'RE NOT SURE,
SEE ME.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.433
THESE NEED TO GO TO
THE BLOOD BANK FOR TESTING.

11:12.467 --> 11:14.167
THANKS.

11:14.200 --> 11:16.767
WHAT ARE THOSE FOR?
MEREDITH IS A/B.

11:16.800 --> 11:20.233
SHE'S BEEN DOWN A LONG TIME,
BUT, YOU KNOW, SHE'S STRONG.

11:20.267 --> 11:23.300
WE SHOULDN'T GIVE UP.
I WASN'T PLANNING TO,
BUT THANKS.

11:23.333 --> 11:24.633
OKAY.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.167
IS THIS STRESS RELATED,

11:26.200 --> 11:28.733
OR AM I DOING SOMETHING SPECIFIC
TO PISS YOU OFF?

11:28.767 --> 11:30.667
BECAUSE BELIEVE ME,
WE NEED TO PULL TOGETHER.
NOT "WE."

11:30.700 --> 11:34.067
WHAT?
YOU KEEP GOING ON ABOUT HOW "WE"
NEED TO DO THIS FOR MEREDITH

11:34.100 --> 11:35.833
AND HOW STRONG MEREDITH IS,
LIKE YOU KNOW HER.

11:35.867 --> 11:38.600
I DO KNOW HER.
NO, GEORGE, CRISTINA AND ME,
WE KNOW HER.

11:38.633 --> 11:41.500
WE'RE HER FAMILY. WE WERE HERE
LONG BEFORE YOU AND GEORGE

11:41.533 --> 11:44.333
STARTED FOOLING AROUND.
HEY, HE IS MY HUSBAND.

11:44.367 --> 11:46.433
STOP SAYING THAT
LIKE IT MEANS SOMETHING.

11:46.467 --> 11:49.233
IT'S A PIECE OF PAPER. YOU ACT
LIKE IT GIVES YOU HISTORY

11:49.267 --> 11:50.700
OR WEIGHT.
OKAY, ENOUGH! ENOUGH.

11:50.733 --> 11:53.700
I WILL NOT BE RUN OFF.
I AM HERE. GEORGE WANTS ME HERE.

11:53.733 --> 11:56.500
AND IF YOU CAN ACCEPT THAT,
THAT--THAT I LOVE HIM, TOO,

11:56.533 --> 11:58.667
THEN MAYBE WE COULD BE,
I DON'T KNOW, FRIENDS?
(scoffs)

11:58.700 --> 12:00.600
OR YOU CAN KEEP ON
THE WAY YOU ARE

12:00.633 --> 12:03.267
AND BE THAT PERSON
THAT GEORGE USED TO KNOW.

12:03.300 --> 12:05.200
YOU DON'T GET TO DECIDE THAT.
GEORGE DECIDES.

12:05.233 --> 12:06.667
OH, I KNOW WHAT HE'LL DECIDE.

12:06.700 --> 12:09.567
AND IF I WERE YOU, I WOULD
THINK ABOUT IT LONG AND HARD,

12:09.600 --> 12:12.333
BECAUSE YOU CANNOT AFFORD
TO LOSE ANOTHER FRIEND,

12:12.367 --> 12:14.267
NOT WHEN PEOPLE
AROUND YOU KEEP...

12:14.300 --> 12:17.067
KEEP... DROPPING LIKE FLIES.

12:17.100 --> 12:20.467
IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE
ABOUT TO SAY?

12:20.500 --> 12:22.367
(bell tolls)

12:22.400 --> 12:26.367
SO ALL OF YOU JUST
DISAPPEAR AT WILL?
WHAT HAPPENED?

12:26.400 --> 12:27.733
I DROWNED. THAT'S IT.

12:27.767 --> 12:30.100
REALLY?
THEN WHY ARE WE HERE?

12:30.133 --> 12:32.067
AGAIN.

12:32.067 --> 12:34.833
I CAN'T DO THIS IF YOU'RE
GONNA KEEP SAYING YOU DROWNED.

12:34.867 --> 12:37.267
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH THAT HURT?

12:37.300 --> 12:39.667
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU
CAME INTO THE E.R.,

12:39.700 --> 12:42.700
YOU WERE SO BRAVE,
SO STRONG.
I WAS IN SHOCK!

12:42.733 --> 12:45.467
AND YOU GUYS DOPED ME UP.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:45.500 --> 12:48.700
IN RETROSPECT, WHAT HAPPENED
TO ME REALLY SUCKED.

12:48.733 --> 12:52.333
I WAS YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL
AND IN LOVE.

12:52.367 --> 12:54.267
I WAS GETTING MARRIED
IN FOUR MONTHS,

12:54.300 --> 12:55.833
AND THEN I WAS DYING.

12:55.867 --> 12:59.067
AND HERE YOU ARE, ALL HAPPY
AND PERKY TO BE DEAD.

12:59.067 --> 13:02.733
YOU THINK I WANT TO BE HERE?
I SWAM. I FOUGHT HARD.

13:02.767 --> 13:05.667
THE WATER WAS COLD.
ALL RIGHT, BUT THAT THING
IN THE TUB, WHAT WAS THAT?

13:05.700 --> 13:09.100
IT WASN'T ANYTHING. IT WAS...
YOU SEE ME IN THE TUB?

13:09.133 --> 13:11.067
I DO NOT SEE WOMEN
IN THE BATHTUB.

13:11.067 --> 13:13.533
I WISH I SAW W--

13:13.567 --> 13:15.267
WE KNOW THINGS.

13:15.300 --> 13:18.167
YOU HAD TO THINK ABOUT IT. NO
DAUGHTER OF ELLIS GREY COULD--

13:18.200 --> 13:20.500
THIS IS SO NOT
AN ELLIS GREY THING.
AH, IT'S A DEREK THING.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.667
I WOULD NEVER--
(Bonnie) YOU WOULD.

13:22.700 --> 13:24.300
I KNOW CRAPPY THINGS
HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU,

13:24.333 --> 13:26.067
BUT HOW CAN YOU BE A SURGEON

13:26.100 --> 13:28.167
AND HAVE
SO LITTLE RESPECT FOR LIFE?

13:28.200 --> 13:29.533
HOW... (groans)

13:29.567 --> 13:32.133
OH, COME ON. (gasps)

13:33.467 --> 13:35.300
(grunts)

13:38.567 --> 13:41.100
(sighs)

13:43.067 --> 13:45.767
WHO ARE YOU HERE FOR?

13:45.800 --> 13:47.167
WHAT?

13:47.200 --> 13:49.100
I'M WAITING ON MY WIFE.

13:49.133 --> 13:50.300
CAR HIT HER.

13:50.333 --> 13:53.467
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT,
ON THE FERRY?

13:53.500 --> 13:55.833
SHE WAS RUN OVER
ON THE FERRY.

13:55.867 --> 13:58.467
THEY HAVEN'T SAID MUCH.

13:58.500 --> 14:02.100
HARD AS HELL TO GET ANY OF
THESE PEOPLE TO TALK TO YOU.

14:02.133 --> 14:03.533
YEAH, I'M, UH...

14:05.333 --> 14:08.267
MY GIRLFRIEND WAS THERE, TOO.

14:08.300 --> 14:11.200
AND I DON'T KNOW...

14:11.233 --> 14:13.300
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

14:13.333 --> 14:15.733
IT'S OUT OF OUR HANDS.

14:15.767 --> 14:18.067
IT'S UP TO THE DOCTORS NOW.

14:18.100 --> 14:19.600
YEAH.

14:19.633 --> 14:22.233
(chuckles) YEAH.

14:23.667 --> 14:25.467
WHAT'S HER NAME?

14:25.500 --> 14:27.600
MEREDITH.

14:30.767 --> 14:33.100
I'LL PUT HER IN MY PRAYERS.

14:33.133 --> 14:35.667
THANKS.

14:47.767 --> 14:50.500
(bell tolling)

14:50.533 --> 14:52.767
I NEED TO GET IN THERE AND FIND
THE SOURCE OF THIS BLEEDING.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.600
HONESTLY, MER, IT'S--IT'S
JUST GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.

14:54.633 --> 14:57.067
WHERE IS SOMETHING
TO WIPE UP THIS BLOOD?

15:02.533 --> 15:04.200
FOOL ME ONCE...

15:04.233 --> 15:06.833
OH, GOOD, YEAH. SHOW UP NOW,
BE A SMART-ASS.

15:06.867 --> 15:08.767
WE HAVE A JOB TO DO.
WHERE ARE YOU?

15:08.800 --> 15:10.800
YOU KNOW,
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.

15:10.833 --> 15:12.700
SHE'S EITHER GONNA GET IT
OR SHE'S NOT.
GET WHAT?

15:12.733 --> 15:15.367
THE WAY I SEE IT, IT DOESN'T
MATTER HOW YOU GOT HERE.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.533
YOU'RE EITHER IN THIS THING
OR YOU'RE NOT.

15:17.567 --> 15:19.233
THERE IS NO IN BETWEEN.

15:19.267 --> 15:21.433
AND COWBOY HERE
CAN GET PISSED OFF,

15:21.467 --> 15:24.133
BECAUSE FOR ALL HIS TOUGH TALK,
HE'S NO DIFFERENT FROM BONNIE.

15:24.167 --> 15:25.333
HE'S STUCK.
AND YOU'RE NOT?

15:25.367 --> 15:26.333
NO.
OH, PLEASE.

15:26.367 --> 15:28.467
STOP. I HAD A GOOD LIFE.
I HELPED WHEN I COULD.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.633
AND WHEN THAT SHELL
WENT OFF IN MY HANDS,

15:30.667 --> 15:31.833
I COMPLETED MY TASK.

15:31.867 --> 15:35.200
I SAVED YOU.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.433
(Richard)
WHAT ABOUT ANOTHER EPI?

15:41.467 --> 15:43.600
WE'VE BEEN PUSHING EPI FOR
AN HOUR AND A HALF NOW.

15:43.633 --> 15:45.433
CHECK ANOTHER LEAD.

15:45.467 --> 15:48.100
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

15:48.133 --> 15:50.167
ASYSTOLE ON THREE LEADS,
SIR.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.233
WHAT ABOUT HER TEMP?
DOWN TO 86 DEGREES.

15:52.267 --> 15:53.767
86?

15:53.800 --> 15:55.733
IT'S 86 NOW? IT WAS 89.

15:55.767 --> 15:57.600
AFTERDROP PHENOMENON.

16:10.133 --> 16:13.067
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

16:15.467 --> 16:18.067
MM.

16:20.533 --> 16:23.500
WATER. GET ME SOME WATER.

16:42.767 --> 16:44.500
YOU BROKE HER.

16:44.533 --> 16:47.133
YOU CALL HER ORDINARY.

16:47.167 --> 16:49.067
YOU TAUGHT HER
TIME AND TIME AGAIN

16:49.100 --> 16:51.733
THAT NOTHING SHE DOES,
EVER, IS GOOD ENOUGH.

16:51.767 --> 16:54.400
EVERY GOOD THING
MEREDITH IS...

16:54.433 --> 16:57.267
HAPPENED DESPITE YOU.

16:57.300 --> 16:59.100
SHE MAY NOT SURVIVE THIS,

16:59.133 --> 17:00.300
AND THAT'S ON YOU.

17:00.333 --> 17:01.767
THAT IS ON YOU.

17:01.800 --> 17:03.400
(Addison) DEREK.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.600
THE WOMAN IS JUST--
SHE'S A BLACK HOLE,
THERE'S NO QUESTION.

17:09.633 --> 17:10.800
BUT SHE CAN'T HELP HERSELF,

17:10.833 --> 17:12.733
AND SHE CERTAINLY
CAN'T FIX MEREDITH.

17:12.767 --> 17:15.300
IT'S MY FAULT.
DON'T.

17:15.333 --> 17:18.267
SEE, I KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON,
AND I WASN'T THERE FOR HER.
YOU WERE HUMAN.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.200
SHE WAS PULLING AWAY FROM ME,

17:20.233 --> 17:23.067
AND I JUST... I...
I JUST...

17:23.100 --> 17:26.233
Y-YOU THINK THAT SHE WENT
IN THE WATER ON PURPOSE?

17:26.267 --> 17:30.100
SHE KNOWS HOW TO SWIM.

17:30.133 --> 17:32.567
SHE'S A GOOD SWIMMER.

17:34.133 --> 17:36.833
DEREK, YOU DON'T KNOW
THAT SHE'S...

17:36.867 --> 17:39.433
NO, YOU DO NOT
GET TO BREAK DOWN.

17:39.467 --> 17:43.200
YOU DO NOT GET TO FALL APART,
NOT WHEN THERE'S STILL A CHANCE,

17:43.233 --> 17:45.367
AND THERE STILL IS
A CHANCE, DEREK. OKAY?

17:45.400 --> 17:47.133
OKAY.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.733
(pager beeps)

17:48.767 --> 17:51.100
OKAY.

17:54.533 --> 17:57.400
(bell tolling)

17:59.600 --> 18:03.300
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
SOMETHING STRONG.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.200
THE NEXT TIME BONNIE DECIDES
TO BLEED OUT,

18:05.233 --> 18:07.500
I'M GONNA DOPE HER
TO HIGH HEAVEN AND--

18:07.533 --> 18:10.067
WHY ARE WE STILL TALKING
ABOUT HER?
IF I CAN FIND THE SOURCE--

18:10.100 --> 18:12.567
SHE CAN'T BE SAVED.
THIS ISN'T FAIR.
I COULD SAVE HER.

18:12.600 --> 18:16.500
IF YOU'D JUST GIVE ME A CHANCE,
I COULD SAVE HER.

18:16.533 --> 18:18.433
WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT WATER?

18:18.467 --> 18:20.500
I SWAM. I FOUGHT.

18:20.533 --> 18:23.433
NO, YOU DIDN'T. AND YOU
CAN'T STAY HERE, MEREDITH.

18:23.467 --> 18:25.300
I DON'T WANT TO!

18:25.333 --> 18:27.200
YEAH, YOU DO.

18:27.233 --> 18:29.400
IT'S EASIER.

18:29.433 --> 18:32.100
BUT YOU CAN'T,

18:32.133 --> 18:33.333
BECAUSE GEORGE'S DAD DIED,

18:33.367 --> 18:34.833
BECAUSE IZZIE LOST ME.

18:34.867 --> 18:36.767
AND CRISTINA?
WHEN SHE WAS 9,

18:36.800 --> 18:38.700
SHE WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT
WITH HER FATHER,

18:38.733 --> 18:41.067
AND HE BLED OUT
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER

18:41.100 --> 18:43.500
WHILE THEY WAITED FOR
AN AMBULANCE TO ARRIVE.

18:43.533 --> 18:44.833
AND ALEX--
STOP.

18:44.867 --> 18:47.533
THEY ARE BARELY BREATHING.
THIS WILL BREAK THEM.

18:47.567 --> 18:50.333
AND NONE OF THEM
DESERVES THAT.

18:50.367 --> 18:54.133
AND THIS--
THIS IS THE BIG ONE...

18:54.167 --> 18:56.300
SO YOU PAY ATTENTION.

18:56.333 --> 18:58.767
DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND
OF MIRACLE IT IS

18:58.800 --> 19:00.700
THAT DEREK IS WHO HE IS?

19:00.733 --> 19:04.600
DO YOU KNOW HOW RARE IT IS THAT
SOMEONE LIKE HIM EVEN EXISTS?

19:04.633 --> 19:06.533
HE'S STILL AN OPTIMIST.

19:06.567 --> 19:12.467
HE STILL BELIEVES IN TRUE LOVE
AND MAGIC AND... SOUL MATES.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.133
HE'S WAITING FOR YOU,

19:14.167 --> 19:16.233
AND IF YOU DON'T
COME BACK FROM THIS,

19:16.267 --> 19:19.733
YOU WILL CHANGE WHO HE IS.

19:19.767 --> 19:22.667
(panting)

19:25.200 --> 19:27.667
OH, GOD.

19:34.667 --> 19:38.067
OH.

19:42.333 --> 19:44.233
(sighs)

19:46.800 --> 19:48.700
(monitor beeping erratically)

19:48.733 --> 19:51.567
(woman) CODE BLUE.
CODE BLUE.

19:53.267 --> 19:55.233
(beeping continues)

19:59.333 --> 20:03.200
WHAT ABOUT
A CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS?

20:03.233 --> 20:06.067
COME ON.
WE COULD DO IT HERE.

20:07.767 --> 20:09.667
PAGE BURKE
AND THE SURGICAL TEAM.

20:09.700 --> 20:11.100
GET HIM HERE NOW.

20:11.133 --> 20:13.400
(Richard)
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR...

20:13.433 --> 20:16.533
YOU KNOW, THIS IS--
THIS IS QUALITY SUDOKU, JOE.

20:16.567 --> 20:18.433
THIS IS, LIKE,
$2 WORTH OF SUDOKU.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.400
GOOD TO KNOW.

20:22.333 --> 20:25.200
NO CHANGE.
I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

20:25.233 --> 20:27.100
NO KIDDING.

20:27.133 --> 20:29.167
WELL, SOME DO, YOU KNOW,
COME BACK FROM THIS.

20:29.200 --> 20:31.100
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I AM NOT A CIVILIAN.

20:31.133 --> 20:33.467
I KNOW THE SCIENCE HERE.
IT'S DRINKING TIME.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.100
NOT YET. YOU HAVE
A RESPONSIBILITY TO MEREDITH.

20:35.133 --> 20:37.533
(scoffs) UNH-UNH.
I DON'T DO THIS STUFF.

20:37.567 --> 20:39.600
I MEAN, YOU SHOULD KNOW.
I GO TO GREAT LENGTHS.

20:39.633 --> 20:41.533
YOU WERE THERE
WHEN I NEEDED YOU.

20:41.567 --> 20:43.133
AFTER.

20:43.167 --> 20:46.267
AFTER I KNEW
YOU WERE GONNA MAKE IT.

20:46.300 --> 20:48.367
OKAY, I'M NOT PROUD.

20:48.400 --> 20:51.667
OKAY? I JUST...

20:51.700 --> 20:54.767
I CAN'T.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.133
I CAN'T GO BACK THERE.

20:56.167 --> 20:59.333
I CAN'T--I CAN'T GO BACK THERE
AND WATCH HER...

20:59.367 --> 21:01.567
(pager beeps)

21:02.733 --> 21:06.133
LISTEN TO ME.

21:06.167 --> 21:07.633
THIS IS ABOUT YOU

21:07.667 --> 21:09.567
AND THE WOMAN YOU CALL
YOUR "PERSON."

21:09.600 --> 21:11.800
AND YOU DO KNOW
THE SCIENCE HERE.

21:11.833 --> 21:13.167
AND IF SHE DIES,

21:13.200 --> 21:15.600
AND YOU ARE SITTING HERE
WHEN THAT HAPPENS,

21:15.633 --> 21:19.067
I CAN'T SEE YOU
COMING BACK FROM THAT.

21:19.067 --> 21:21.067
COME AND SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR FRIEND.

21:28.367 --> 21:30.133
(bell tolls)

21:30.167 --> 21:32.167
I WAS SWIMMING.

21:32.200 --> 21:35.067
I WAS FIGHTING.

21:35.100 --> 21:38.100
AND THEN I THOUGHT--
JUST FOR A SECOND--

21:38.133 --> 21:42.067
I THOUGHT...

21:42.100 --> 21:44.400
WHAT'S THE POINT?

21:47.067 --> 21:49.700
AND I LET GO.

21:49.733 --> 21:52.267
I STOPPED FIGHTING.

21:54.333 --> 21:57.367
DON'T TELL ANYBODY.

21:57.400 --> 22:00.067
OKAY.

22:09.533 --> 22:12.433
(bell tolling)

22:16.533 --> 22:19.067
WHAT?

22:24.433 --> 22:25.100
IZZIE.

22:25.133 --> 22:26.567
YOU CAN SEE HER?

22:26.600 --> 22:28.833
NO.

22:28.867 --> 22:31.833
BUT SOMETIMES...

22:31.867 --> 22:37.667
WE'LL BE IN THE SAME PLACE
AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME.

22:37.700 --> 22:43.067
AND... OH, I CAN
ALMOST HEAR HER VOICE.

22:44.533 --> 22:46.467
IT'S LIKE I'M TOUCHING HER.

22:46.500 --> 22:50.567
I LIKE TO BELIEVE
SHE KNOWS I'M THERE.

22:52.867 --> 22:57.200
(sighs)
THAT'S ALL YOU GET,

22:57.233 --> 22:58.700
THAT'S IT,

22:58.733 --> 23:01.600
MOMENTS WITH THE PEOPLE
YOU LOVE.

23:01.633 --> 23:04.667
AND THEY'LL MOVE ON.
AND YOU'LL WANT THEM TO MOVE ON.

23:04.700 --> 23:08.300
BUT STILL, MEREDITH,
THAT IS ALL YOU GET, MOMENTS.

23:08.333 --> 23:10.100
IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING?

23:10.133 --> 23:11.533
I DON'T KNOW.

23:11.567 --> 23:14.167
THIS IS YOUR AFTERLIFE,
NOT MINE.

23:14.200 --> 23:16.767
(sighs)

23:29.733 --> 23:31.633
ANY CHANGE?

23:31.667 --> 23:33.300
NO.

23:33.333 --> 23:36.067
GEORGE, COME ON.

23:36.100 --> 23:38.367
WE CAN'T DO THIS TODAY,
NOT TODAY.
WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU SAY TO MY WIFE?

23:38.400 --> 23:41.067
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
WE BOTH SAID THINGS.
I SAW HER FACE.
I SAW HER FACE.

23:41.100 --> 23:42.833
SHE WAS--
SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING,
BUT WHY?

23:42.867 --> 23:45.600
WHY WOULD YOU PICK NOW
TO THROW DOWN?
I DIDN'T. I...

23:45.633 --> 23:48.067
I CAN'T LIE ABOUT HOW I FEEL.

23:48.100 --> 23:50.800
ACTUALLY, YOU CAN. YOU CAN.
PEOPLE LIE ALL THE TIME.

23:50.833 --> 23:52.733
THEY HOLD THEIR TONGUES
AND THEY WAIT.

23:52.767 --> 23:55.533
YOU SHOULD HOLD YOUR TONGUE
BECAUSE IF I'M NOT

23:55.567 --> 23:58.833
MAKING A MISTAKE,
YOU'RE GONNA LOOK LIKE A JERK,

23:58.867 --> 24:00.733
AND IF I AM,
I'M GONNA NEED YOU.

24:00.767 --> 24:03.467
I NEED YOU, AND YOU--YOU KEEP
TAKING THAT AWAY.

24:06.167 --> 24:08.067
(monitor beeping erratically)

24:08.100 --> 24:10.667
PLACE THE C02 MONITOR.
DID YOU PAGE DR. BURKE?

24:10.700 --> 24:13.433
HE'S IN TRAUMA DOING
CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS.

24:13.467 --> 24:15.633
ON MEREDITH GREY?
YES, SIR.

24:15.667 --> 24:18.500
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY, PUSH 1 OF ATROPINE.

24:18.533 --> 24:20.300
(beeping continues)

24:20.333 --> 24:21.833
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

24:21.867 --> 24:23.100
BILLY, WHAT'S HER TEMP?

24:23.133 --> 24:25.400
WE'RE UP TO 96.

24:25.433 --> 24:27.767
(sighs) THAT'S GOOD. GOOD.
ALL RIGHT.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.200
NOW WE JUST HAVE TO GET
HER HEART BEATING.
(Preston) OKAY, DRAW AN A.B.G.

24:30.233 --> 24:32.833
PUSH 1 OF EPI, A GRAM OF MAG
AND AN AMP OF CALCIUM.

24:32.867 --> 24:35.567
I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE.
I WANT TO GO BACK.

24:35.600 --> 24:38.600
WE WERE TOLD
THERE WASN'T A LOT OF TIME.
I'M OUT OF TIME?

24:38.633 --> 24:42.233
WELL, WE'RE NOT SURE, BABY.
OH, GOD. I CAN'T...

24:42.267 --> 24:44.167
I W--OH.

24:44.200 --> 24:46.500
I-I-I HAD INTIMACY ISSUES.

24:46.533 --> 24:47.767
YEAH.

24:47.800 --> 24:49.633
DO YOU KNOW HOW STUPID
THAT SEEMS NOW?

24:49.667 --> 24:51.200
YEAH, I DO.

24:51.233 --> 24:52.600
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

24:52.633 --> 24:54.533
IT'S NOT ENOUGH,
JUST A WHIFF OF DEREK

24:54.567 --> 24:57.467
OR JUST--OR CRISTINA.

24:57.500 --> 25:00.433
I NEED TO GO BACK.
PLEASE.

25:00.467 --> 25:03.300
I CAN'T--I CAN'T...
(gasping)

25:03.333 --> 25:05.500
(monitor beeping erratically)

25:05.533 --> 25:07.433
THIS IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN,
NOT TODAY.

25:07.467 --> 25:10.800
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE
ON ME TODAY, NOT TODAY.
(alarm blaring)

25:10.833 --> 25:12.700
V-FIB. GIVE ME THE PADDLES.

25:12.733 --> 25:14.367
(defibrillator buzzing)
CLEAR.

25:14.400 --> 25:16.533
(Richard) HOW MANY EPIS
IS THAT?

25:16.567 --> 25:18.200
SIX.
WHAT'S THE EXTERNAL PACER?

25:18.233 --> 25:19.833
IT'S NOT CATCHING.
BILLY,
WHAT'S HER BODY TEMP?

25:19.867 --> 25:21.767
(Billy) 98.
SO SHE'S WARM?

25:21.800 --> 25:23.800
YES.

25:23.833 --> 25:26.200
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

25:30.200 --> 25:32.167
AND DEAD.

25:32.200 --> 25:35.333
***

25:40.533 --> 25:43.500
V-FIB.
THAT LOOKS LIKE V-FIB.

25:43.533 --> 25:45.500
SHOCK HER AT 300.
CHARGED.

25:45.533 --> 25:46.467
CLEAR.

25:46.500 --> 25:48.400
(monitor beeps)

25:48.433 --> 25:51.533
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

25:51.567 --> 25:53.367
***

25:53.400 --> 25:55.833
YOU CANNOT GIVE UP.
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

25:55.867 --> 25:58.733
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH TIME
AND EFFORT AND ENERGY AND--

25:58.767 --> 26:02.500
AND--AND RESOURCES
AND DRUGS...

26:02.533 --> 26:04.567
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

26:04.600 --> 26:06.567
YOU CANNOT GIVE UP.

26:06.600 --> 26:09.267
***

26:09.300 --> 26:11.167
TURNING THE PACER UP
TO MAX.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.567
IF THERE WAS ANY OUNCE
OF ACTIVITY,

26:13.600 --> 26:16.400
THE PACER
WOULD'VE PICKED IT UP.

26:16.433 --> 26:19.333
(tone continues)

26:19.367 --> 26:23.333
***

26:23.367 --> 26:26.567
(tone continues)

26:26.600 --> 26:32.400
SHE'S BEEN ON BYPASS
FOR... ALMOST AN HOUR.

26:32.433 --> 26:34.533
(tone continues)

26:34.567 --> 26:38.300

26:38.333 --> 26:41.200

26:58.667 --> 27:03.067
(sobs) I CAN'T BREATHE.
THIS WILL PASS.

27:03.067 --> 27:05.200
IT WON'T. IT FEELS LIKE...

27:05.233 --> 27:09.233
(sobbing)

27:11.733 --> 27:14.067
MOM?

27:20.733 --> 27:23.633
(bell tolling)

27:32.200 --> 27:34.567
GO.

27:34.600 --> 27:37.067
GO, MEREDITH.

27:59.300 --> 28:00.533
TRY AGAIN.

28:05.267 --> 28:07.700
TRY AGAIN!

28:16.333 --> 28:20.500
OKAY, ONE MORE ROUND
OF A.C.L.S. DRUGS?

28:20.533 --> 28:22.433
ONE MORE.

28:30.867 --> 28:34.067
(alarm blaring)
STILL V-FIB.
OKAY CHARGE TO 300.

28:34.067 --> 28:35.467
CLEAR.

28:45.800 --> 28:47.767
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

28:50.233 --> 28:51.600
NEITHER SHOULD YOU.

28:51.633 --> 28:54.533
JUST KEEP GOING.

28:54.567 --> 28:57.633
DON'T BE A DAMN...

29:07.133 --> 29:09.400
YOU ARE...

29:09.433 --> 29:14.300
YOU ARE ANYTHING
BUT ORDINARY, MEREDITH.

29:26.367 --> 29:27.567
NOW RUN.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.833
RUN.

29:29.867 --> 29:33.067
(bell tolling)

29:33.067 --> 29:34.667
(Derek) IS THE LIDOCAINE IN?

29:34.700 --> 29:36.233
(alarm blaring)
(Tyler) YES.

29:36.267 --> 29:37.600
OKAY, HOLDING COMPRESSIONS.

29:37.633 --> 29:39.533
COME ON. COME ON.
COME ON, ELLIS. COME ON.

29:39.567 --> 29:41.500
(mouths words)

29:52.867 --> 29:57.067
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

30:01.633 --> 30:03.833
(monitor beeping)

30:03.867 --> 30:06.033
SINUS BRADY.
(Preston) OKAY.

30:06.067 --> 30:07.633
WE GOT A HEARTBEAT.

30:07.667 --> 30:10.167
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

30:10.200 --> 30:12.267
WE GOT IT.

30:12.300 --> 30:14.300
(beeping continues)

30:14.333 --> 30:15.833
(chuckles)

30:15.867 --> 30:19.267
(beeping continues)

30:27.867 --> 30:29.800
(gasps)

30:38.067 --> 30:39.733
SHE'S BREATHING ON HER OWN?

30:39.767 --> 30:41.700
SHE IS.

30:45.267 --> 30:47.133
SHE'S BEEN DOWN A LONG TIME.

30:47.167 --> 30:49.067
DO WE KNOW
THE BRAIN FUNCTION YET?

30:49.100 --> 30:52.700
WE DON'T KNOW.
DEREK, DOES, UM--

30:52.733 --> 30:55.333
I HAVEN'T PAGED HIM YET.
I WANTED TO...

30:55.367 --> 30:57.267
(sighs)

30:57.300 --> 30:59.633
I'M GIVING HER MORE TIME.

31:23.433 --> 31:25.733
(mutters)

31:25.767 --> 31:28.200
DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?

31:28.233 --> 31:30.233
DID YOU JUST SPEAK?

31:30.267 --> 31:31.567
OH.

31:31.600 --> 31:33.500
OH, MEREDITH. OKAY, MER,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU.

31:33.533 --> 31:35.067
OKAY? TRY--TRY AGAIN.

31:35.067 --> 31:36.767
TRY AGAIN--
TRY AGAIN FOR ME, OKAY?

31:36.800 --> 31:39.067
(mutters)

31:42.667 --> 31:44.167
WHAT? I, UM...

31:44.200 --> 31:46.500
I CAN'T...

31:46.533 --> 31:50.367
PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T BE...

31:52.533 --> 31:55.300
YOUR BRAIN WORKS. OKAY?

31:55.333 --> 31:58.200
SO ALL YOU NEED TO DO
IS FORM A WORD.

31:58.233 --> 31:59.767
PLEASE.

32:04.467 --> 32:05.733
OUCH.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.767
OH, GOD.

32:18.800 --> 32:21.167
OH.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.067
HI.

32:23.067 --> 32:25.300
I'M GETTING MARRIED
TO BURKE.

32:25.333 --> 32:27.600
NOT THAT
THAT SHOULD BE

32:27.633 --> 32:29.533
ANYWHERE ON YOUR LIST
OF THOUGHTS RIGHT NOW,

32:29.567 --> 32:32.700
BUT JUST IN CASE YOU SLIP
IN THE HALL LATER OR...

32:35.600 --> 32:38.200
YOU ARE THE ONE PERSON
I WANTED TO TELL.

32:42.433 --> 32:45.333
THANK YOU FOR NOT DYING.

33:38.567 --> 33:40.267
HEY.

33:40.300 --> 33:43.067
HEY.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.767
(sighs)

33:57.800 --> 34:00.567
(sighs)

34:02.833 --> 34:05.667
MEREDITH...

34:05.700 --> 34:07.600
MY MOTHER'S DEAD,
ISN'T SHE?

34:10.333 --> 34:12.233
YES.

34:14.067 --> 34:17.667
IT'S OKAY...

34:17.700 --> 34:21.833
I THINK.

34:21.867 --> 34:23.667
(sighs)

34:26.467 --> 34:29.433
I THINK IT'S OKAY.

34:38.833 --> 34:42.267
SO SHE'S OKAY?

34:42.300 --> 34:44.833
YEAH.

34:44.867 --> 34:47.800
WE NEVER HAD THAT.

34:47.833 --> 34:52.433
HE NEVER...
FELT THAT WAY ABOUT ME.

34:54.233 --> 34:57.167
I DID.

34:59.200 --> 35:02.067
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I THINK
WHAT A WASTE IT IS

35:02.067 --> 35:03.800
TO THROW AWAY
ALL THAT HISTORY.

35:03.833 --> 35:05.100
I'M FLAWED.

35:05.133 --> 35:07.567
I'M A-A WRECK.

35:07.600 --> 35:09.567
BUT YOU--

35:09.600 --> 35:11.467
IT WASN'T A GAME.

35:15.367 --> 35:17.400
60 DAYS.

35:17.433 --> 35:21.100
GO 60 DAYS WITH NO SEX,
NO OTHER WOMEN.

35:21.133 --> 35:23.767
60 DAYS COLD TURKEY,

35:23.800 --> 35:25.667
THEN MAYBE I'LL BELIEVE YOU.

35:25.700 --> 35:27.767
SO I ONLY HAVE SEX
WITH YOU.

35:27.800 --> 35:31.500
(laughs) NO.
NO SEX WITH ANYONE.

35:31.533 --> 35:33.100
GROW UP, MARK.

35:33.133 --> 35:35.433
FIND ANOTHER WAY
TO SCRATCH THE ITCH.
SAY I DO.

35:35.467 --> 35:37.333
YOU'LL GIVE US A TRY,
A REAL TRY?

35:37.367 --> 35:39.567
THE COUPLE THING--
NO SNEAKING AROUND,

35:39.600 --> 35:42.133
NO BOOTY CALLS?
IF YOU MAKE IT, YES.

35:42.167 --> 35:44.067
OKAY. WE'RE ON.

35:45.400 --> 35:47.167
OH, AND, ADDISON?
HMM?

35:47.200 --> 35:49.800
IF I'M NOT HAVING SEX,
NEITHER ARE YOU.

35:49.833 --> 35:53.067
WHO WOULD I POSSIBLY
BE HAVING SEX WITH?

35:55.200 --> 35:57.500
(sighs) HOW YOU DOING?

35:57.533 --> 36:00.367
I HURT ALL OVER.

36:00.400 --> 36:01.733
HOW'S YOUR FRIEND?

36:01.767 --> 36:03.567
WELL, SHE PULLED THROUGH.

36:03.600 --> 36:05.500
GOOD. THAT'S GREAT.

36:05.533 --> 36:07.833
AND... NOBODY'S...

36:07.867 --> 36:10.167
CLAIMED YOU?
NO. NO, NOTHING YET.

36:10.200 --> 36:12.600
SO WE STILL
DON'T KNOW ANYTHING?

36:12.633 --> 36:14.500
OH, OH, NO, NOT SO.

36:14.533 --> 36:16.167
WE, UH, LEARNED A LOT
ABOUT YOU TODAY.

36:16.200 --> 36:18.067
WELL, WE KNOW THAT
YOUR HEART IS HEALTHY.

36:18.067 --> 36:21.433
WE KNOW THAT YOUR BLOOD TYPE
IS B-POSITIVE.

36:21.467 --> 36:23.367
MM, YOU PROBABLY
EAT PRETTY HEALTHY,

36:23.400 --> 36:25.200
BECAUSE YOUR CHOLESTEROL LEVEL
IS EXCELLENT

36:25.233 --> 36:27.267
AND YOU'RE NOT DIABETIC.

36:27.300 --> 36:29.200
YOUR LUNGS DON'T LOOK LIKE
SMOKER'S LUNGS,

36:29.233 --> 36:32.100
AND YOU DON'T DRINK ALCOHOL
ON FERRIES IN THE MORNING.

36:32.133 --> 36:35.733
AND YOU'RE ABOUT, UH,
OH, 32 YEARS OLD.

36:35.767 --> 36:38.667
AND YOUR BABY IS A GIRL.

36:42.433 --> 36:46.233
REALLY? A GIRL?

36:46.267 --> 36:48.100
YEAH.

36:48.133 --> 36:50.133
(chuckles)

36:50.167 --> 36:54.067
OH.

36:54.067 --> 36:55.400
(chuckles)

36:55.433 --> 36:58.300
AND I THINK I AM MARRIED.
I FEEL MARRIED.

36:58.333 --> 37:00.700
YEAH?
YEAH.

37:00.733 --> 37:04.333
SEE, NOW I KNOW MORE ABOUT YOU
THAN SOME OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS.

37:04.367 --> 37:05.533
(chuckles)

37:05.567 --> 37:07.467
THAT'S PATHETIC.

37:07.500 --> 37:10.433
(laughs)

37:10.467 --> 37:13.133
HELD IT DOWN.
THANKS.

37:13.167 --> 37:16.433
WHAT YOU DID TODAY
WITH MEREDITH...

37:16.467 --> 37:17.800
EVERYBODY'S TALKING.

37:17.833 --> 37:20.733
CHIEF RESIDENT TALK.

37:20.767 --> 37:22.667
OKAY, I'M TALKING--
TO MYSELF--

37:22.700 --> 37:27.433
BUT... YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME
A RUN FOR MY MONEY.

37:30.367 --> 37:33.633
YEAH, I AM.

37:42.067 --> 37:43.700
I LET YOU DOWN.

37:43.733 --> 37:47.133
AND I GET IT IF YOU
DON'T TRUST ME RIGHT NOW.

37:47.167 --> 37:49.567
BUT...

37:51.500 --> 37:53.800
PLEASE, GEORGE.

37:53.833 --> 37:56.333
IT'S ME.

37:56.367 --> 38:00.100
IT'S US.

38:00.133 --> 38:03.167
PLEASE.

38:07.133 --> 38:10.567
AT THE END OF A DAY LIKE THIS,

38:10.600 --> 38:13.467
A DAY WHEN SO MANY PRAYERS
ARE ANSWERED

38:13.500 --> 38:15.633
AND SO MANY AREN'T...

38:15.667 --> 38:19.267
***

38:19.300 --> 38:22.400
YOU'VE BEEN GONE
A LONG TIME.

38:25.067 --> 38:28.800
I KNOW YOU THINK DIED
WHEN THE ALZHEIMER'S STARTED.

38:30.800 --> 38:34.567
I KNOW IT'S A RELIEF TO YOU.

38:34.600 --> 38:37.700
I KNOW.

38:37.733 --> 38:43.267
BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE
A RELIEF TO ME.

38:43.300 --> 38:46.100
I'M NOT RELIEVED.

38:48.100 --> 38:51.200
I MISS THE SOUND
OF YOUR VOICE.

38:51.233 --> 38:54.300
I MISS TALKING TO YOU.

38:54.333 --> 38:57.133
***

38:57.167 --> 38:59.533
I MISS YOU.

38:59.567 --> 39:02.467
***

39:08.267 --> 39:13.067
I DYED MY HAIR...

39:13.100 --> 39:14.267
FOR THE LADIES.

39:14.300 --> 39:17.133
(chuckles)

39:17.167 --> 39:20.067
***

39:26.367 --> 39:30.133
(softly) DAMN.

39:30.167 --> 39:32.067
***

39:32.100 --> 39:35.667
WE TAKE OUR MIRACLES
WHERE WE FIND THEM.

39:35.700 --> 39:37.633
***

39:37.667 --> 39:39.600
WE REACH ACROSS THE GAP...

39:39.633 --> 39:42.500
AND SOMETIMES...

39:42.533 --> 39:46.100
AGAINST ALL ODDS...

39:46.133 --> 39:50.300
AGAINST ALL LOGIC...

39:50.333 --> 39:52.233
WE TOUCH.

39:52.267 --> 39:55.167
***

40:05.533 --> 40:08.033
IZZIE.

40:08.067 --> 40:10.800

40:26.733 --> 40:29.600
