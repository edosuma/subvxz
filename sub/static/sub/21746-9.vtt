01:14.416 --> 01:15.416
Oi.

01:16.791 --> 01:17.791
Morning.

01:31.166 --> 01:32.166
You getting in?

01:42.625 --> 01:43.875
Si, what time is it?

01:45.416 --> 01:46.416
7:00.

01:46.750 --> 01:49.500
Christ, sod off, Si.

01:53.291 --> 01:54.291
Breakfast?

02:06.166 --> 02:07.750
Interesting.
Come in and say hello.

02:12.083 --> 02:13.875
Keep an eye out
for your mum, all right?

02:30.291 --> 02:31.291
Yeah?

02:32.625 --> 02:33.625
Crisp sandwich.

02:36.416 --> 02:37.416
Go on, then.

02:38.166 --> 02:39.958
Mum won't let me
have that for breakfast.

02:40.041 --> 02:41.361
Well, your mum's
not here, is she?

02:51.625 --> 02:52.625
Give it, Simon.

02:57.958 --> 02:58.958
Come here.

03:03.833 --> 03:05.166
Would you rather...

03:10.458 --> 03:11.458
Um...

03:11.833 --> 03:12.833
Yeah?

03:14.708 --> 03:16.333
Get your scalp ripped off...

03:18.541 --> 03:21.125
or jump off from one mile
of a building?

03:22.416 --> 03:24.000
I suppose I have to
go with the scalp.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.267
Because if you jumped off
a building

03:26.291 --> 03:28.208
that was one mile high,
right, you'd be...

03:28.833 --> 03:30.250
bad, it's just bad.

03:30.333 --> 03:31.333
You'd be dead, right?

03:32.875 --> 03:34.333
So I'll go with the scalp,
I guess.

03:37.208 --> 03:38.208
Morning.

03:38.583 --> 03:39.500
Morning, Mum.

03:39.583 --> 03:40.583
Morning.

03:54.166 --> 03:55.166
Put the kettle on?

03:57.750 --> 03:59.708
- Would you rather...
- Right.

03:59.833 --> 04:02.750
Eat maggots and flies,

04:02.833 --> 04:06.583
or go in a bath full
of daddy longlegs?

04:07.333 --> 04:09.625
I'd go in the bath
anytime. Yeah.

04:10.416 --> 04:11.875
Conker.

04:12.666 --> 04:14.708
We're gonna go feed
the dogs in a minute.

04:16.083 --> 04:17.291
Go on, then.

04:17.375 --> 04:20.166
Would you rather know
how you're gonna die,

04:20.250 --> 04:22.041
or know when you're gonna die?

04:22.125 --> 04:23.125
Cheers, darling.

04:24.416 --> 04:26.375
- Why not?
- No, that's a horrible one.

04:27.666 --> 04:29.083
That's a horrible one.

04:29.791 --> 04:31.208
Si, come here.

04:32.583 --> 04:34.625
What are you looking
at him for? Go on.

04:38.416 --> 04:39.333
What am I doing?

04:39.416 --> 04:41.458
Certificates. We're behind.

04:42.833 --> 04:44.708
Why don't you just give him
a day off, love?

04:44.791 --> 04:45.871
Come on, we'll do it later.

04:46.958 --> 04:47.791
All right?

04:47.875 --> 04:49.041
We've got to do these jobs.

04:49.416 --> 04:51.083
I ain't joking, Si, do it.

04:51.166 --> 04:52.333
I'm sick of telling you.

04:53.250 --> 04:54.500
I wanna help Jack.

04:54.583 --> 04:55.583
Pack it in.

04:59.125 --> 05:00.208
Do your jobs.

05:02.291 --> 05:03.833
You know it's Saturday, right?

05:05.916 --> 05:07.208
Yeah, I know this is Saturday.

05:14.666 --> 05:15.866
Simon, I ain't playing. Do it.

05:18.291 --> 05:19.291
Give him a day off.

05:21.875 --> 05:23.583
He's not your fucking disciple.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.541
Oi, come here. Go on.

05:35.625 --> 05:36.625
Put your wellies on.

05:45.125 --> 05:46.125
Love ya.

05:46.291 --> 05:47.291
Fuck off.

05:55.625 --> 05:56.625
Oi.

05:57.916 --> 05:58.916
Come here.

06:00.958 --> 06:02.750
Cor, it's fucking freezing.

06:05.333 --> 06:06.333
Go on.

06:10.125 --> 06:11.333
Thank you very much.

06:18.625 --> 06:20.750
Now, get the lab food.
All right?

06:21.000 --> 06:22.666
See, it's written on it.
All right?

06:23.750 --> 06:24.791
Is there a scoop in there?

06:25.041 --> 06:26.041
Yeah.

06:29.041 --> 06:30.041
Ta.

06:30.750 --> 06:31.750
That's...

06:32.416 --> 06:33.875
Collin and...

06:33.958 --> 06:35.416
- Barbara.
- Barbara?

06:36.750 --> 06:37.750
Collin and Barbara.

06:37.791 --> 06:39.291
All right.

06:42.833 --> 06:44.750
This is Jeff and Sandra.

06:45.375 --> 06:46.375
Seriously.

06:48.166 --> 06:49.392
These ones haven't got
any names.

06:49.416 --> 06:51.083
- What do you reckon?
- Um...

06:52.125 --> 06:53.416
Michael and James.

06:58.750 --> 06:59.750
I'll tell you what...

07:00.958 --> 07:02.583
There you go, kiddies.

07:03.500 --> 07:04.500
There you go.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.476
You think your mum
would let you have one?

07:06.500 --> 07:07.541
Yeah, yeah.

07:08.833 --> 07:09.833
All right.

07:09.916 --> 07:11.416
So, what's the golden rule?

07:11.500 --> 07:13.416
- Always go at two.
- Always go on two.

07:13.500 --> 07:14.708
- Close your eyes.
- Yeah.

07:15.333 --> 07:16.458
Close your eyes.

07:23.708 --> 07:24.750
All right, here you go.

07:25.333 --> 07:27.166
Five.

07:27.250 --> 07:28.708
Four.

07:28.791 --> 07:30.583
Three.

07:32.083 --> 07:33.333
Two. Always go on two.

07:33.875 --> 07:35.375
Aw.

07:35.875 --> 07:37.041
Aw.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.166
Take him back and give him
a wash, all right?

08:05.125 --> 08:06.583
- Yeah.
- Hang on.

08:08.083 --> 08:09.666
Hey, here you go.

08:14.250 --> 08:15.416
- Hello?
- Jim,

08:15.916 --> 08:16.916
tell me you got him.

08:17.333 --> 08:18.833
No, I'm working on his sister.

08:18.916 --> 08:20.625
Sister? It's Frank
we need, mate.

08:20.708 --> 08:21.726
You've been on this for months.

08:21.750 --> 08:23.333
You're wasting your time
at the farm.

08:23.416 --> 08:24.791
You've got a better idea?

08:25.416 --> 08:26.416
Who's a good boy?

08:28.000 --> 08:29.416
Night and Whitey.

08:30.416 --> 08:31.708
Good boy.

08:32.166 --> 08:33.166
You still there?

08:33.207 --> 08:34.558
You need to make
contact with Frank.

08:34.582 --> 08:35.892
One more week
and then we're pulling you out.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.000
Fuck off.

08:52.250 --> 08:53.916
All right?

08:55.000 --> 08:57.083
Give us a hand. Give us a hand.

09:00.375 --> 09:01.375
Got it?

09:06.333 --> 09:07.333
There you are.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.083
You coming back later?

09:14.791 --> 09:17.333
Yeah.

09:22.541 --> 09:23.666
Will you bring me something?

09:23.750 --> 09:25.208
Yeah, bits and bobs.

09:25.291 --> 09:26.333
Bits and bobs.

09:52.166 --> 09:53.875
Right, Nick.
You got a chance to score.

09:53.958 --> 09:55.291
- Rabbits.
- Rabbits, done.

09:55.375 --> 09:57.125
- Fox.
- Fox, done.

09:57.208 --> 09:58.750
- Worms.
- Worms, done.

09:58.833 --> 10:01.416
- Bulls.
- Bulls.

10:05.500 --> 10:06.740
What are we gonna do about Mal?

10:10.750 --> 10:12.430
What am I gonna tell him
when he gets back?

10:13.291 --> 10:14.291
Nothing.

10:17.166 --> 10:18.166
Nothing?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.400
Fuck me, you're serious,
aren't you?

10:23.375 --> 10:24.375
Aren't you?

10:25.500 --> 10:26.666
What about the little fellow?

10:26.750 --> 10:28.166
It's nothing to do with him.

10:28.916 --> 10:31.125
You... You're either serious
or you're not.

10:31.208 --> 10:34.458
If you're not, you might as well
just pack your stuff and go.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
All right.

10:38.791 --> 10:39.875
I'll fuck off, then.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.250
Go on, then.

10:51.875 --> 10:53.500
Go and get your shit
and you can go.

10:53.583 --> 10:54.583
Go on, out.

10:54.625 --> 10:55.625
Out!

10:55.875 --> 10:57.083
Stop. No!

10:57.875 --> 10:59.833
- Don't... Fuck...
- Come on.

11:02.625 --> 11:03.625
Mum.

11:05.208 --> 11:06.208
What, love?

11:08.458 --> 11:09.875
I heard fighting.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.760
We're not fighting, love.
We're just talking.

11:14.166 --> 11:15.291
Come on.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.875
Come on, let's go back to bed.

11:16.958 --> 11:17.958
Come on.

11:19.958 --> 11:21.250
Come on.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.125
What's the matter?

13:23.333 --> 13:24.666
What are you doing here, Jack?

13:28.750 --> 13:30.000
What do you think this is?

13:39.875 --> 13:40.892
You come and go as you please.

13:40.916 --> 13:43.076
I don't know where you go
when you're not here with me.

13:55.625 --> 13:56.625
I think you're right.

13:58.375 --> 13:59.833
I think it's best if you leave.

14:02.583 --> 14:04.000
I'm not going anywhere, darling.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.166
I don't care about Mal.

14:07.958 --> 14:08.958
I'm not leaving you.

14:11.416 --> 14:13.958
He's my husband, Jack.

14:14.041 --> 14:15.750
I know.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.958
Do you have any idea
what he's gonna do to me

14:20.041 --> 14:21.375
if he finds out?

14:24.583 --> 14:25.583
I'm dead.

14:29.541 --> 14:31.250
He's gonna snap my fucking neck.

14:32.583 --> 14:33.750
And him.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.250
I can't play with you anymore.

14:41.583 --> 14:42.583
You should go.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.250
I'm not leaving you, darling.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.541
I can't take care of

14:54.083 --> 14:55.083
the three of us

14:56.541 --> 14:59.000
on a caretaker's wage,
so I'm going to

15:00.125 --> 15:01.333
go get some work.

15:11.791 --> 15:12.791
Do...

15:15.125 --> 15:16.375
Do you love me, Jack?

15:17.875 --> 15:18.875
Of course I do.

15:23.791 --> 15:25.750
Of course. Come here.

15:25.833 --> 15:27.541
Come here. I love you.

15:28.333 --> 15:29.333
I'm not leaving you.

15:37.458 --> 15:38.458
Okay.

15:42.458 --> 15:43.458
Go talk to Frank.

15:45.833 --> 15:46.916
He'll help us out.

16:05.833 --> 16:06.958
That's it.

16:19.250 --> 16:21.000
We going to live with Jack, Mum?

16:24.583 --> 16:25.958
Why, would you like that?

16:30.458 --> 16:31.458
Sit down.

16:37.125 --> 16:38.916
Right, I'm gonna tell you
something now,

16:39.000 --> 16:40.920
I want you to remember it,
right? It's important.

16:43.958 --> 16:45.758
Do you know, the only bloke
I've ever trusted,

16:46.833 --> 16:48.291
or I'll ever really trust,

16:49.833 --> 16:50.833
is you.

16:52.541 --> 16:53.541
Do you know why?

16:57.208 --> 16:58.625
'Cause you're my reward

17:01.458 --> 17:03.916
for all the shit
that's been thrown at me.

17:06.165 --> 17:07.165
You...

17:11.625 --> 17:14.165
You're the most amazing
thing that ever happened to me.

17:16.833 --> 17:17.875
My little boy.

17:19.208 --> 17:20.608
You'll always will be
my little boy.

17:23.540 --> 17:24.540
Remember that.

17:25.875 --> 17:28.290
Go on.

17:33.875 --> 17:34.875
In there.

17:55.750 --> 17:57.958
Jesus, Jesus Christ.

17:58.875 --> 18:00.625
Fucking scared
the shite out of me.

18:00.708 --> 18:01.833
Fuck.

18:07.875 --> 18:08.916
Hello.

18:12.166 --> 18:13.666
How long have you been
standing there?

18:40.250 --> 18:41.666
- Three weeks.
- Yeah.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.166
Three weeks, you couldn't
give me a fucking phone call?

18:48.250 --> 18:49.250
I'm...

18:50.750 --> 18:52.041
I'm sorry, darling.

18:55.708 --> 18:56.833
Fuck you.

18:57.208 --> 18:59.541
Jesus, I promised myself
I wouldn't do this.

19:13.791 --> 19:14.958
Do you fuck her?

19:15.333 --> 19:16.333
Tsk..

19:29.500 --> 19:30.500
You do.

19:33.916 --> 19:34.916
Do you fuck her?

19:42.333 --> 19:44.083
Fuck.

19:44.208 --> 19:45.875
Fuck it. Fuck.

20:33.083 --> 20:35.083
- Mum.
- Shit.

20:36.125 --> 20:37.166
Mum.

20:39.958 --> 20:41.750
- I'll get it. I'll get it.
- I'll go.

20:42.958 --> 20:43.958
I'll get it.

21:18.958 --> 21:20.166
Hush, little baby,

21:21.916 --> 21:23.000
don't say a word,

21:26.791 --> 21:28.625
Daddy's gonna buy you
a mockingbird.

21:32.583 --> 21:34.541
And if that mockingbird
don't sing,

21:38.500 --> 21:40.125
Daddy's gonna buy you
a diamond ring.

22:20.291 --> 22:21.291
Si!

22:29.041 --> 22:30.916
Come on, lazy,
eat your breakfast.

22:43.166 --> 22:45.208
Did you get that
to match Jack's?

22:46.750 --> 22:47.750
These are mine.

22:48.833 --> 22:50.250
All right, go on,
eat your brekkie.

22:51.125 --> 22:52.333
Be out in a minute, yeah?

23:18.416 --> 23:20.291
- You all right?
- I'm all right.

23:22.333 --> 23:24.083
- So your dad is all right?
- Yeah.

23:24.625 --> 23:25.666
What did you bring me?

23:27.458 --> 23:28.750
- Bits and bobs.
- Bits and bobs.

23:29.500 --> 23:30.791
Nice to see you.

23:31.708 --> 23:32.708
Yeah?

23:37.625 --> 23:39.166
- Mum. Mum.
- Turn around.

23:39.250 --> 23:40.916
Fuck.

23:41.916 --> 23:43.208
Gotcha.

23:46.916 --> 23:48.000
Come on.

23:50.291 --> 23:51.291
Come on.

24:05.916 --> 24:06.916
She told him.

24:08.500 --> 24:10.208
Told who what?

24:10.833 --> 24:12.458
About you.

24:13.500 --> 24:14.583
Told who about me?

24:15.875 --> 24:16.708
Uncle Frank.

24:16.791 --> 24:18.416
Yeah? What did he say?

24:20.666 --> 24:21.826
He says he wants to meet you.

24:23.958 --> 24:24.958
That's nice.

24:26.750 --> 24:28.000
I said I liked you.

24:30.958 --> 24:31.958
Aw.

24:40.791 --> 24:41.791
Do you love Mama?

24:45.083 --> 24:46.083
Of course I do.

24:50.208 --> 24:52.041
Why do you always
leave her though?

25:00.750 --> 25:01.750
Got a light?

25:01.791 --> 25:02.791
Yep.

25:08.125 --> 25:09.125
There you go.

25:10.625 --> 25:11.625
Cheers, mate.

25:19.750 --> 25:20.750
Oi, oi.

25:27.333 --> 25:29.500
- Here you are, darling.
- Thank you.

25:29.583 --> 25:30.916
It's fucking freezing.

25:41.541 --> 25:42.958
Come on, Jack.

25:47.333 --> 25:49.875
Come on. Stop.

26:30.583 --> 26:31.583
Whitey.

27:00.125 --> 27:01.208
Whitey!

27:10.791 --> 27:11.791
Whitey!

27:13.083 --> 27:14.083
Whitey!

27:17.208 --> 27:18.208
Come on!

27:20.916 --> 27:21.916
Whitey!

27:26.833 --> 27:28.458
Maybe I'll give you some treats.

27:31.541 --> 27:32.541
Come on!

27:40.250 --> 27:41.250
Where are you?

27:44.083 --> 27:45.083
Whitey!

28:07.000 --> 28:08.791
How long has she been
shagging him?

28:11.166 --> 28:12.166
Look at me.

28:14.541 --> 28:15.901
How long have you
known about this?

28:35.833 --> 28:37.625
What, you gonna hold out
on the old man?

28:39.083 --> 28:41.083
You could've told me,
couldn't you?

28:44.666 --> 28:46.333
You're a little shit.

28:47.208 --> 28:49.375
You've always been
a little shit.

29:02.666 --> 29:03.666
Oi!

29:07.750 --> 29:08.958
Simon!

29:10.791 --> 29:12.541
Make a fucking sound

29:13.166 --> 29:15.750
and I'll stab you through
your fucking heart.

29:21.166 --> 29:22.166
Simon!

29:25.000 --> 29:26.250
Get out, get out.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.041
Shut your fucking mouth
and get out.

29:30.041 --> 29:31.791
I'm gonna ruin that cunt.

29:31.875 --> 29:33.458
- Can't, mate.
- What?

29:33.541 --> 29:34.583
Do you want us both shot?

29:34.666 --> 29:35.726
What are you talking about?

29:35.750 --> 29:37.708
Frank's farm.
Can't bring the cops down here.

29:37.791 --> 29:39.666
Fuck Frank,
it's my fucking wife.

29:39.750 --> 29:41.375
I understand that,
but you need to chill.

29:41.750 --> 29:43.541
Fucking listen... Ooh, Jesus.

29:53.083 --> 29:54.083
Jack!

30:00.666 --> 30:01.750
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:03.208 --> 30:04.208
What's the matter?

30:04.250 --> 30:05.375
Dad. Dad.

30:09.958 --> 30:11.998
Si, come on, fucking
hurry up, we've gotta go, love.

30:13.166 --> 30:14.366
Si, you ready? We've gotta go.

30:15.333 --> 30:16.333
Si!

30:16.958 --> 30:20.458
All right, Simon, help me
find the keys, love. Quick.

30:21.041 --> 30:23.750
Shit, Jack, where's
the fucking keys?

30:26.000 --> 30:27.666
All right..

30:29.625 --> 30:30.958
Hello, love.

31:00.125 --> 31:01.291
And I trusted you.

31:03.500 --> 31:05.000
Nice little operation.

31:06.458 --> 31:07.458
And my family.

31:11.625 --> 31:14.208
All you had to do was to be
a good little caretaker.

31:23.958 --> 31:25.333
Wasn't hard, was it?

31:42.708 --> 31:44.458
Hells, go and wait
outside with the boy.

31:53.958 --> 31:55.583
Foxy, get her outside, mate.

32:02.375 --> 32:03.791
- Move.
- Don't fucking touch me.

32:10.083 --> 32:12.916
Mal, come on, don't do it.
You can't fucking just...

32:13.000 --> 32:14.166
Fucking deaf? Get...

32:14.250 --> 32:15.500
Get off me, you fucking...

32:15.583 --> 32:16.875
Mal, please, don't do it.

32:16.958 --> 32:19.333
- Move! Move!
- Mal, don't! Mal!

32:31.541 --> 32:32.583
Tata, cunt.

32:35.333 --> 32:37.000
Take one for
the force then, shall I?

33:22.041 --> 33:23.041
He's filth.

33:26.875 --> 33:27.875
What?

33:28.583 --> 33:29.583
You...

33:31.250 --> 33:33.625
have been sucking on
a bobby's cock, my dear.

33:35.583 --> 33:36.958
What are you talking about?

33:39.875 --> 33:41.041
He's Old Bill.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.708
How much have you told him?

33:52.250 --> 33:55.166
- Mal!
- How much have you told him?

33:55.250 --> 33:56.458
I've told him nothing.

33:56.541 --> 33:58.166
I swear to you,
I've told him nothing.

33:58.250 --> 34:00.333
- Mal, don't!
- Come fucking here. Get your...

34:00.416 --> 34:02.125
Mum! Mum!

34:05.541 --> 34:06.541
Mum!

34:10.625 --> 34:11.833
It's rape,

34:12.250 --> 34:13.250
Hells.

34:15.666 --> 34:19.666
You've been gangbanged
by Special Operations.

34:21.041 --> 34:24.916
You've been fucked by the whole
of New Scotland fucking Yard.

34:25.208 --> 34:26.750
- Simon.
- No, don't...

34:26.833 --> 34:30.625
Did you know that your
mummy is a fucking whore?

34:35.916 --> 34:38.166
Get your fucking hands off me.

34:38.625 --> 34:39.791
No, Mal, I wasn't...

34:40.583 --> 34:41.916
How does it feel...

34:44.041 --> 34:47.333
to degrade yourself
in front of your own son?

34:48.750 --> 34:51.000
To disappoint him like this?

34:52.125 --> 34:55.458
To let him see his own mother

34:57.041 --> 34:58.041
shamed?

35:00.458 --> 35:02.541
Did he say that he loved you?

35:03.583 --> 35:04.583
He did,

35:05.833 --> 35:06.833
didn't he?

35:09.875 --> 35:11.750
I'll bet he's got
a mortgage to pay,

35:14.541 --> 35:16.208
mouths to feed.

35:18.458 --> 35:20.958
I bet you hadn't thought
about that, had you, girl?

35:23.708 --> 35:25.041
That he might have a...

35:25.791 --> 35:26.875
a real wife.

35:27.666 --> 35:28.916
A home.

35:30.916 --> 35:33.666
A real happy family.

35:40.500 --> 35:41.541
The ones

35:42.541 --> 35:46.583
that he really, really loves.

35:55.375 --> 35:56.375
Here.

35:58.958 --> 36:00.166
You take this, girl.

36:04.125 --> 36:05.666
You do the right thing.

37:25.875 --> 37:26.875
Malcolm.

37:29.250 --> 37:30.250
Malcolm.

37:32.458 --> 37:33.458
Frank.

37:35.041 --> 37:36.250
Nice.

37:45.500 --> 37:46.833
Who vouched for him?

37:48.625 --> 37:49.625
No one.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.791
He's owed us
a few grand at poker.

37:53.750 --> 37:55.000
Offered to work off the debt.

38:06.750 --> 38:08.625
Someone knows,
you know that, Fox.

38:09.333 --> 38:11.416
- You find out for me.
- Yeah, all right, Mal.

38:24.791 --> 38:25.791
Hey, kid.

38:45.166 --> 38:46.333
Helen.

38:47.500 --> 38:48.541
It wasn't my fault, Frank.

38:48.625 --> 38:49.958
I'm gonna save you.

39:05.458 --> 39:07.583
What did you tell him?

39:08.208 --> 39:10.750
Nothing.

39:10.833 --> 39:12.873
I ain't told him anything.
He doesn't know anything.

39:16.541 --> 39:17.708
Is that what you care about?

39:17.791 --> 39:18.791
You know it isn't.

39:21.416 --> 39:23.000
Don't you care about me, Frank?

39:28.083 --> 39:29.333
Of course I do.

39:33.291 --> 39:34.291
I love you.

39:36.916 --> 39:37.958
You're me sister.

39:42.416 --> 39:43.500
Halfsister, remember?

39:44.791 --> 39:47.250
Yeah, halfsister.

39:54.416 --> 39:56.625
Come here.

40:11.208 --> 40:12.267
You know if it gets out that

40:12.291 --> 40:13.771
the old blue are
on to me, I'm fucked.

40:14.750 --> 40:15.875
No one will go near me.

40:16.791 --> 40:18.250
I'll lose everything.

40:19.750 --> 40:22.166
Years and years
of fucking grafting.

40:26.333 --> 40:27.791
Are you gonna kill him, Frank?

40:39.041 --> 40:40.208
Kill him.

40:41.291 --> 40:43.250
- Will you kill him for me?
- He's a cop.

40:43.333 --> 40:44.208
- Please.
- You don't kill cops.

40:44.291 --> 40:45.517
Don't you know what he's done
to me, Frank?

40:45.541 --> 40:47.017
He come in here
and he's fucking humiliated me.

40:47.041 --> 40:48.791
- He fucking raped me, Frank!
- Enough!

40:49.250 --> 40:51.500
- Ya got no fucking selfrespect.
- Enough!

40:58.333 --> 40:59.333
I do this,

41:00.166 --> 41:02.833
it's the last mess of yours
I'm ever gonna clean up,

41:02.916 --> 41:03.958
have you got that?

41:05.083 --> 41:06.083
Yeah?

41:24.458 --> 41:26.500
You break my fucking heart,
you know that?

41:28.208 --> 41:29.208
I'm sorry.

41:52.750 --> 41:53.750
Frank?

41:55.291 --> 41:56.291
Frank!

42:07.708 --> 42:08.750
Mum, are you all right?

42:10.208 --> 42:11.958
Come here. Come here.

42:43.625 --> 42:44.625
Oi.

42:46.375 --> 42:47.375
Hi, Simon.

42:49.083 --> 42:50.625
She betrayed me, Frank.

42:53.083 --> 42:54.250
This isn't their fault.

42:55.583 --> 42:57.783
You brought me here. This is
your mess, you clean it up.

42:59.708 --> 43:00.791
He's Old Bill.

43:04.041 --> 43:05.458
You take Helen and the boy,

43:05.750 --> 43:07.583
you leave
and you don't come back.

43:09.541 --> 43:10.541
Foxy.

43:14.500 --> 43:15.625
Where are you going?

43:17.000 --> 43:18.666
None of your fucking business.

43:20.583 --> 43:22.041
You know what she's been like.

43:23.041 --> 43:24.184
Years me and you been through...

43:24.208 --> 43:25.416
Fuck off.

43:35.791 --> 43:36.791
Come here.

43:39.333 --> 43:40.916
Come here..

43:46.041 --> 43:47.041
All right, mate?

43:52.208 --> 43:53.208
Can you let me out?

44:43.208 --> 44:44.208
You lied.

44:44.625 --> 44:45.625
I know.

44:46.750 --> 44:47.750
I know I did,

44:48.625 --> 44:49.875
but I got to get to a hospital,

44:51.375 --> 44:52.958
then I can come back

44:53.041 --> 44:54.041
for you and your mum.

44:59.916 --> 45:01.375
What about your real family?

45:02.583 --> 45:03.583
Listen,

45:05.666 --> 45:06.946
your dad's gonna
fucking kill me,

45:08.333 --> 45:10.125
then he's gonna kill your mum.

45:11.041 --> 45:12.458
You got to let me out, mate.

45:31.208 --> 45:32.208
Five.

45:32.833 --> 45:33.833
Four.

45:34.625 --> 45:35.625
Three.

45:36.458 --> 45:37.458
Two.

45:48.291 --> 45:50.250
Look after your mum,
all right? All right?

45:53.625 --> 45:54.750
Where are you going?

45:55.916 --> 45:56.958
I can't stay here.

45:57.666 --> 46:00.083
I can't stay here.
I can't stay here.

46:00.625 --> 46:02.541
Listen!

46:03.458 --> 46:04.291
All right.

46:04.375 --> 46:05.559
Now, I'm gonna get cleaned up,

46:05.583 --> 46:07.184
and I'm gonna come back
for you and your mum.

46:07.208 --> 46:08.375
When?

46:08.458 --> 46:09.458
Soon.

46:12.083 --> 46:13.083
Promise.

46:40.500 --> 46:41.500
I waited

46:42.875 --> 46:43.875
and I waited,

46:45.958 --> 46:47.166
but he never came back.

46:49.625 --> 46:51.916
I tried to keep the dogs alive
as long as I could, but...

46:54.250 --> 46:55.958
when Mum tried to drink
herself to death,

46:56.041 --> 46:57.208
they all starved.

46:58.791 --> 46:59.791
One by one.

47:02.458 --> 47:03.541
What did you do?

47:07.958 --> 47:09.166
They put me in care.

47:11.916 --> 47:14.166
And so I spent 10 years
trying to find him.

47:16.500 --> 47:17.541
Track him down.

47:19.833 --> 47:20.833
Make it right.

47:23.000 --> 47:24.166
By killing a child?

47:27.125 --> 47:29.708
That was never meant
to happen. I swear.

47:29.833 --> 47:31.333
You fired into a car

47:31.416 --> 47:32.517
- with a kid in it.
- He ducked.

47:32.541 --> 47:34.261
You were pointing a gun
at a fucking family.

47:34.875 --> 47:36.708
He's a coward, Anna.

47:37.208 --> 47:38.416
You're pathetic.

47:39.666 --> 47:40.666
Don't say that.

47:41.083 --> 47:42.809
You're the most pathetic
person I've ever met.

47:42.833 --> 47:44.750
- Anna, please, don't.
- Don't touch me.

47:46.250 --> 47:47.833
No, don't leave, Anna.

47:50.291 --> 47:51.625
Don't you ever leave me.
