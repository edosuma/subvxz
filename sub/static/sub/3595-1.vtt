00:39.065 --> 00:43.857
Mummy got sick.
It happened just like that.

00:44.904 --> 00:48.238
Nobody could stop it.

00:48.408 --> 00:52.192
It isn't fair.
There's no reason.

00:52.370 --> 00:58.076
And if we start asking why,
we'll go crazy.

01:20.440 --> 01:25.351
Five minutes in the microwave.
Any one of them.

01:27.280 --> 01:30.649
Do you know how to make juice?

01:33.161 --> 01:37.159
Microwave. Five minutes.

01:52.972 --> 01:57.468
Here. It's my shrink.
Call him.

02:06.527 --> 02:10.691
Loss of Spouse Support Group.

02:10.865 --> 02:16.322
Chicago Cancer Family Network.
Parents without Partners.

02:16.496 --> 02:20.873
"Hug Yourself",
"Hug a Friend", "Hug a Shrink" ...

02:21.042 --> 02:26.961
Work hard, that'll save you.
Only work will see you through this.

02:32.011 --> 02:37.219
Don't mind him.
he's just a guy who's lost his wife.

02:41.312 --> 02:45.559
What I think we really need is ...
change.

02:45.733 --> 02:51.154
Good idea. Take a few weeks off.
take Jonah fishing.

02:52.949 --> 02:57.362
No, real change.
A new city.

02:58.413 --> 03:03.454
Some place where I don't think
of Maggie at every corner.

03:11.175 --> 03:14.591
Where are you gonna go?

03:16.723 --> 03:19.807
I was thinking about Seattle.

03:20.643 --> 03:25.638
In a few months, you'll be seeing
women. You'll meet someone.

03:25.815 --> 03:32.945
Move on. fine. that's what I'll do.
I'll just grow a new heart.

03:33.114 --> 03:39.034
- Sam, I'm sorry, I didn't mean ...
- I know. But it can't happen twice.

05:28.646 --> 05:33.771
- The tall redhead is cousin Irene.
- You'll see her disappointed look.

05:33.943 --> 05:40.741
- Harold ran off with the secretary.
- Until Irene had the dog put down.

05:40.909 --> 05:45.736
Your brother Dennis
is professor at Johns Hopkins.

05:45.914 --> 05:51.537
- He's married to ... Betsy.
- The most competitive woman ever.

05:51.711 --> 05:56.207
- How will I remember all this?
- Walter, you will!

06:08.311 --> 06:12.807
- Uncle Milton lost all his money.
- And some other people's.

06:12.982 --> 06:17.561
... in a pyramid scheme. Don't
mention the IRS or the prisons.

06:17.737 --> 06:21.106
Your mother's Barbara.
your father's Cliff ...

06:21.282 --> 06:25.150
- He has electric trains.
- Really?

06:25.328 --> 06:32.659
- Am I what they had in mind?
- Walter, they're gonna love you!

06:35.171 --> 06:40.248
Everybody ...
Annie has an announcement.

06:40.426 --> 06:44.175
Walter and I are engaged.

07:02.073 --> 07:04.196
Bless you!

07:05.827 --> 07:10.868
- Are you all right?
- Maybe it's the flowers.

07:11.040 --> 07:15.370
- We'll move them.
- No! I feel terrible, sneezing now.

07:15.545 --> 07:20.622
- This is a very important moment.
- He's just allergic to everything.

07:20.800 --> 07:24.299
Bees.
I'm allergic to bees.

07:24.470 --> 07:30.224
He's allergic to all bees. We
have to take adrenalin with us.

07:30.393 --> 07:36.846
- If he eats just a bit of a nut ...
- My head swells, and I drop dead.

07:37.025 --> 07:41.236
- It's the same with him and bees.
- We had salmon at our wedding ...

07:41.404 --> 07:47.193
- A wedding without salmon is ...
- I'm not allergic to salmon.

07:47.368 --> 07:49.859
But you never know.

07:50.038 --> 07:54.166
- You never know.
- He wasn't always allergic to bees.

07:54.334 --> 08:01.629
- What did we do with our champagne?
- Uncle Milton's parole.

08:01.799 --> 08:07.042
- When are you getting married?
- Early June, in the garden.

08:07.222 --> 08:14.220
- What about Harold and bees?
- I'm allergic to bees.

08:14.395 --> 08:18.096
Cold salmon. cucumber salad.
strawberries ...

08:18.274 --> 08:23.435
I'm afraid I am allergic
to strawberries.

08:24.614 --> 08:27.734
Is this all right with you?

08:27.909 --> 08:33.745
I'm the luckiest man-man-man on
the face of the earth-earth-earth.

08:33.914 --> 08:39.953
- That's Lou Gehrig's line from ...
- "Pride of the Yankees".

08:40.129 --> 08:44.875
- "Pride of the Yankees"!
- Baseball. An historical reference.

08:45.051 --> 08:49.796
I would like to propose a toast.
To my kid sister!

08:49.973 --> 08:53.922
To Walter and my baby.

08:57.313 --> 09:01.145
Please eat, before it gets cold.

09:03.736 --> 09:09.691
Here it is. I wouldn't
give it to the Historical Society.

09:09.867 --> 09:14.613
- Oh. Mum ...
- These things are back in fashion.

09:14.789 --> 09:17.956
Grandmother's dress.

09:19.127 --> 09:25.082
- He's a lovely man, Annie.
- He is. isn't he?

09:25.341 --> 09:31.925
And he's a wonderful athlete. We're
going to DC to see his parents.

09:32.098 --> 09:36.226
- How did it happen?
- It's silly, really.

09:36.394 --> 09:41.554
I'd seen him at the office.
He's the associate publisher.

09:41.733 --> 09:45.398
We had both ordered sandwiches. -

09:45.570 --> 09:49.733
- and he got my tomato on wheat,
which he's allergic to, -

09:49.908 --> 09:54.368
- and I got his tomato on white.
Amazing, isn't it?

09:54.537 --> 09:59.532
You make a million decisions.
and a sandwich changes your life.

09:59.709 --> 10:02.461
Destiny takes a hand.

10:02.629 --> 10:08.334
We invented destiny, because we
don't want things to be accidental.

10:08.509 --> 10:13.634
Then why did you order the same
sandwich except for the bread?

10:13.806 --> 10:20.770
How many people like tomato
without something else, like tuna?

10:20.980 --> 10:24.848
It wasn't a sign.
It was a coincidence.

10:25.026 --> 10:29.320
I was in Atlantic City,
where Cliff was a waiter.

10:29.489 --> 10:33.949
He wasn't supposed to work
that night. What if he hadn't?

10:34.118 --> 10:41.948
He asked me to take a midnight walk.
I told you this a million times.

10:42.126 --> 10:50.336
He held my hand. I looked down
and couldn't tell our fingers apart.

10:50.510 --> 10:55.088
- And I knew.
- What?

10:56.808 --> 11:02.431
- What?
- It was magic.

11:04.524 --> 11:11.654
I knew we'd be together forever.
Just like you and Walter.

11:11.823 --> 11:16.200
Walter ... It's quite a formal name.

11:16.953 --> 11:23.122
I knew that your father and I would
have a wonderful time in the ...

11:23.293 --> 11:26.792
... sack, I believe you call it.

11:26.963 --> 11:33.250
It took years before it worked
like clockwork. It takes time.

11:33.428 --> 11:38.553
- We already ...
- Fine, fine. How's it working?

11:38.725 --> 11:43.766
- Like clockwork.
- Oh, honey ...

11:46.065 --> 11:50.858
- It's a sign.
- You don't believe in signs.

11:55.658 --> 11:59.952
They loved you.
I told you they would.

12:00.121 --> 12:03.490
- I love you.
- I love you, Walter.

12:05.335 --> 12:10.577
Did anyone ever call you
anything other than Walter?

12:10.757 --> 12:17.127
- Not even when you were young?
- Not even when I was young.

12:17.305 --> 12:22.014
- Don't you want to drive with me?
- Then I can't get back on Friday.

12:22.185 --> 12:28.104
I forgot your stepmother's present.
When we're old and grey -

12:28.274 --> 12:34.478
- you must remind me to put my teeth
in, so I don't go out without them.

12:34.656 --> 12:37.573
I'll wait.

12:37.742 --> 12:43.033
No, go ahead. We're late anyway.
I'll be ten minutes behind you.

13:13.528 --> 13:16.363
Welcome to "You and Emotions".

13:16.531 --> 13:22.237
I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone,
broadcasting live from Chicago.

13:22.412 --> 13:28.248
Tonight we'll talk about wishes.
What's your wish this Christmas?

13:28.418 --> 13:33.127
My wish is to change the station.

13:33.298 --> 13:38.540
- And now: "You and your spleen".
- Not on your life.

13:38.720 --> 13:43.465
Coming up, "'Jingle bells" backwards ,
sung by ...

13:43.641 --> 13:47.805
- Seattle, go ahead.
- This is 'Jonah ...

13:47.979 --> 13:52.688
No last names, 'Jonah.
How old are you?

13:52.859 --> 13:55.895
- I'm eight.
- You're up late.

13:56.070 --> 14:01.776
- It's not so late in Seattle.
- You're right. What's your wish?

14:01.951 --> 14:07.621
- My dad needs a new wife.
- You don't like the one he has?

14:07.790 --> 14:11.788
- He doesn't have one.
- Where's your mum?

14:11.961 --> 14:17.632
- She died.
- Well. who can believe this?

14:17.800 --> 14:23.590
- I've been sad, but Dad's worse.
- Have you talked to him about it?.

14:23.765 --> 14:29.186
No, that makes him sadder.

14:29.354 --> 14:32.058
'Jonah, is your dad home?

14:32.232 --> 14:36.893
- Is he busy?
- No, he's out on the deck.

14:37.070 --> 14:40.236
Can't you ask him to talk to me?

14:40.406 --> 14:46.279
- Wretched woman! Hang up, Jonah!
- No, he'd kill me.

14:46.454 --> 14:51.282
He won't be angry when he hears
how concerned you are about him.

14:51.459 --> 14:56.702
- Want to bet?
- If he yells, you lose a fan.

14:58.841 --> 15:04.547
Dad. there's someone
on the phone for you.

15:07.559 --> 15:10.096
His name is Sam.

15:10.270 --> 15:15.893
If you've just tuned in, tonight's
topic is wishes and dreams.

15:16.067 --> 15:19.566
We have a listener from Seattle.

15:19.737 --> 15:23.486
Sam, this is Dr. Fieldstone
on Network America.

15:23.658 --> 15:28.901
What are you selling?
Micro-hibachis or knives?

15:29.080 --> 15:34.240
Neither. I want to help.
Your son asked me for advice.

15:34.419 --> 15:39.544
- He wants to find you a new wife.
- Who is this?

15:39.716 --> 15:45.339
Dr. Fieldstone of Network America.
You are on the air.

15:45.513 --> 15:49.842
- You called a radio station?
- Sam, are you there?

15:50.018 --> 15:55.854
- Yes.
- You mourn your wife's death.

15:56.024 --> 15:59.523
Your son is worried about you.

15:59.694 --> 16:04.273
Get out here.
I won't go through this alone.

16:04.449 --> 16:08.612
It's hard for him
to talk to you about this.

16:08.786 --> 16:13.532
If we talk about it,
maybe 'Jonah will feel better.

16:13.708 --> 16:18.951
- Talk to her. She's a doctor.
- Her first name could be Doctor.

16:19.130 --> 16:26.129
- Please.
- Sam, it's his Christmas wish.

16:26.304 --> 16:29.009
- Okay.
- Good.

16:29.182 --> 16:34.425
I know this is difficult.
When did your wife die?

16:35.480 --> 16:41.020
- About a year and a half ago.
- Have you had any relationships?

16:41.861 --> 16:46.238
- No.
- Why not?.

16:48.159 --> 16:52.073
- Marcia ... or Dr. Fieldstone?
- Dr. Marcia.

16:52.247 --> 16:58.415
- I don't mean to be rude ...
- I don't want to pry ...

16:58.586 --> 17:05.964
- Sure you do.
- Go on, Sam. I'm listening.

17:06.135 --> 17:11.377
We had a pretty tough time at first.

17:11.558 --> 17:15.851
But we're dealing with it.

17:16.020 --> 17:22.223
Jonah and I will get along fine,
as soon as I break his radio.

17:23.736 --> 17:26.940
I'm sure you're a wonderful father.

17:27.115 --> 17:31.029
- You can tell a lot from a voice.
- Yes, you can.

17:31.202 --> 17:35.449
But 'Jonah still feels
that you're under a cloud.

17:35.623 --> 17:40.997
- Are you sleeping at night?.
- He doesn't sleep at all.

17:41.170 --> 17:45.417
- How do you know that?
- I live here. Dad.

17:47.385 --> 17:50.968
Look. it's Christmas.

17:54.809 --> 17:58.510
Maggie ... my wife.

17:58.688 --> 18:01.689
She really did it ...

18:01.858 --> 18:06.520
She loved ...
She made everything beautiful.

18:08.656 --> 18:12.488
It's tough this time of year.

18:12.660 --> 18:19.908
- Every kid needs a mother.
- Maybe you need someone, too.

18:22.128 --> 18:26.837
- Yes.
- We'll resume after these messages.

18:27.008 --> 18:33.545
Sam and 'Jonah, don't go away.
I'm talking to Sleepless in Seattle.

18:33.723 --> 18:37.721
We'll be back
with listener response.

18:37.894 --> 18:44.347
- What's that?
- People call in and dump on you.

18:44.525 --> 18:48.393
This is really fun. And helpful.

18:54.452 --> 19:00.241
- I bet he's tall with a cute butt.
- I bet he hasn't bathed in weeks.

19:00.416 --> 19:03.453
- Yes?
- Tea, with the bag out.

19:03.628 --> 19:10.793
- Maybe I'll just go up to Seattle.
- Don't open his refrigerator.

19:10.969 --> 19:16.390
Men don't cover food, and they
leave it in there till it walks out.

19:16.558 --> 19:21.896
I wouldn't kick him out of bed
for eating crackers. 65 cents.

19:22.063 --> 19:28.777
We'll take a call before we talk to
Sleepless. Go ahead, Tennessee.

19:28.987 --> 19:33.613
I'd like to have his address.

19:33.783 --> 19:37.650
Honey, get in line.

19:38.830 --> 19:44.120
- If I could ask you a question ...
- Go ahead.

19:44.294 --> 19:48.422
People who truly loved
are likely to love again.

19:48.590 --> 19:54.924
Sam, could you love anybody
as much as you loved your wife?

19:56.055 --> 20:00.349
Well, that's hard to imagine.

20:00.518 --> 20:03.638
What are you going to do?

20:03.813 --> 20:11.026
Get out of bed every morning
and breathe in and out all day.

20:11.195 --> 20:19.369
And after a while I won't have to
remind myself to do it.

20:21.623 --> 20:29.417
And then after a while I won't
remember how perfect things were.

20:29.631 --> 20:33.878
Why was your wife so special?

20:34.052 --> 20:37.503
Howling is your program?

20:40.016 --> 20:44.429
It was a million little things.

20:44.604 --> 20:49.266
When you added them up, it meant
we were meant for each other.

20:49.442 --> 20:53.819
I knew it
the very first time I touched her.

20:53.988 --> 20:59.908
It was like coming home,
only to no home I'd ever known.

21:00.078 --> 21:03.363
I was just taking her hand -

21:03.539 --> 21:08.166
- to help her out of a car.
And I knew it.

21:09.462 --> 21:14.005
- It was ... Like magic.
- Magic.

21:14.801 --> 21:20.506
It's time to wrap it up.
I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone.

21:20.682 --> 21:25.011
To all my listeners,
a magical and Merry Christmas.

21:25.186 --> 21:32.434
And Sleepless in Seattle,
call and tell us how it's going.

21:32.610 --> 21:35.647
You can count on it.

22:23.828 --> 22:28.704
He sells the best soup ever and
he is the meanest man in America.

22:28.875 --> 22:33.537
- I feel strongly about this.
- Do it.

22:33.713 --> 22:36.286
New Year's Eve. I won't write it.

22:36.466 --> 22:40.713
Listen: "Phone service was
tied up Christmas Eve -

22:40.887 --> 22:45.216
- when a kid called the radio
and said his dad needs a new wife."

22:45.391 --> 22:49.092
2.000 women wanted his number.

22:49.270 --> 22:52.473
I heard it. This kid calls up, -

22:52.649 --> 22:58.734
- and the shrink forces
the father to talk about it.

22:58.905 --> 23:02.025
Suddenly he starts talking -

23:02.200 --> 23:08.618
- about how he fell in love with her
like these cows in Michigan.

23:08.790 --> 23:14.294
The cows that got zapped by stray
voltage. Maybe it was Wisconsin.

23:14.462 --> 23:20.915
Anyway, I was listening to him,
and suddenly I was crying.

23:21.094 --> 23:24.260
Like when I see the ad -

23:24.430 --> 23:29.388
- where the daughter gives her mum
the refrigerator with a red bow.

23:29.561 --> 23:35.184
- Or the to kids at the party ...
- Making an album for Grandfather!

23:35.358 --> 23:38.941
That kills me!

23:39.112 --> 23:42.812
Write about it. Whatever it is.

23:42.991 --> 23:48.780
2,000 women calling for a husband?
Women are desperate for love.

23:48.955 --> 23:54.198
- Especially over a certain age.
- It's hard to get married over 40.

23:54.377 --> 23:59.253
- That statistic is not true.
- But it feels true.

23:59.424 --> 24:04.845
- It's true.
- A new book proves it isn't true.

24:05.013 --> 24:09.342
- Did you read that book?
- Did anybody read that book?

24:09.517 --> 24:12.720
Are you done? Where were we?

24:12.896 --> 24:19.812
If someone's a widower, why is he
widowed and not widowered?

24:21.613 --> 24:24.364
Just wondering.

24:24.532 --> 24:28.945
What was that about up there?
What's with you?

24:29.120 --> 24:36.914
- Nothing.
- There's something. Tell me.

24:37.086 --> 24:41.166
- Sleepless in Seattle?
- That's what she called him.

24:41.341 --> 24:45.635
Now 2.000 women want his number.
He could be a crack head. -

24:45.803 --> 24:53.384
- a transvestite, a junkie,
or really sick, like my Rick.

24:54.729 --> 24:58.145
Actually, he sounded nice.

24:59.317 --> 25:04.394
Really?
Now we're getting down to it.

25:04.572 --> 25:09.863
I'm madly in love with Walter. He
did a crazy thing the other night.

25:11.913 --> 25:17.749
It was so funny.
What was that?

25:27.345 --> 25:32.422
I've got to go to Boston
for the convention.

25:32.600 --> 25:36.598
And I have to visit Winston-Hughes.

25:37.188 --> 25:41.435
Why don't we meet in New York
for Valentine's Day weekend?

25:41.609 --> 25:47.066
- Walter. I'd love to!
- We can stay at the Plaza.

25:47.657 --> 25:54.027
- Ice skate in Central Park.
- Register.

25:54.205 --> 25:59.116
You know ... for dishes.
glasses, silver, everything.

26:01.880 --> 26:04.252
How about it?

26:06.050 --> 26:10.593
- We'll have dim sum in Chinatown.
- Is there wheat in it?

26:10.763 --> 26:14.512
I don't think so.

26:20.940 --> 26:25.318
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, -

26:25.486 --> 26:29.733
- five. four. three. to. one ...

26:29.908 --> 26:34.201
Jonah, wake up.
The ball's dropping.

27:22.544 --> 27:26.707
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

27:30.343 --> 27:34.507
- Kiss Howard.
- Goodnight, Howard.

29:07.023 --> 29:10.273
Can I have half your beer?

29:10.443 --> 29:14.655
Go ahead.

29:14.822 --> 29:20.030
What did I use to say?
"Here's looking at you"?

29:20.203 --> 29:24.331
-"Here's mud in your eye"?
-"Here's to us."

29:24.499 --> 29:28.331
You used to say: "Here's to us."

29:32.340 --> 29:36.551
Oh. babe.
I miss you so much it hurts.

29:54.028 --> 29:54.070
You want to tell him? I'll tell him.

29:54.070 --> 29:58.234
You want to tell him? I'll tell him.

29:58.408 --> 30:02.026
She's back with another idea.

30:02.203 --> 30:08.076
Sam, I'm glad you're here. I heard
you on the radio. I told everyone.

30:08.251 --> 30:13.127
- We already knew. From Grace.
- Then all of Seattle knows.

30:13.298 --> 30:18.719
I was brushing my teeth and there
you were. I called my mother.

30:18.887 --> 30:23.798
I said. "Turn on the radio.
That's my architect."

30:23.975 --> 30:30.060
You know. it's so nice
when a man can express his feelings.

30:30.231 --> 30:34.359
- I wish I could.
- Claire, is there a problem?

30:34.527 --> 30:38.655
I couldn't sleep last night.
You know what that's like.

30:38.823 --> 30:43.781
My platters
won't fit in the refrigerator.

30:43.953 --> 30:49.493
At parties I use platters, so I want
a Sub Zero refrigerator instead.

30:49.667 --> 30:54.543
- We have to redo the cabinets.
- We'll be into this wall.

30:54.714 --> 30:59.874
- A bearing wall.
- That's a delay of five, six ...

31:00.053 --> 31:05.925
- 12 weeks.
- It's important to get it right.

31:06.100 --> 31:10.679
Well. la decorateur calls.
Bye.

31:14.734 --> 31:19.361
It's fate. She's divorced. we don't
want to do this and you need a wife.

31:19.530 --> 31:24.027
- Everything intersects.
- Like the Bermuda Triangle.

31:33.670 --> 31:39.423
Here's one more. Do you have room?

31:39.592 --> 31:44.005
- Dad, they're all for you.
- Here you go.

31:46.724 --> 31:49.476
"Sleepless in Seattle".

31:49.644 --> 31:54.389
If you can't sleep, try drinking a
glass of water from the other side.

31:54.566 --> 32:01.363
That's for hiccups. Or you can hold
a spoonful of sugar in your mouth.

32:02.198 --> 32:04.570
Thank you.

32:04.742 --> 32:10.745
- But why give them our address?
- They called and asked for it.

32:10.915 --> 32:17.167
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are
the most attractive man I've heard."

32:17.338 --> 32:22.131
They called?
You gave them our number, too?

32:22.302 --> 32:25.338
You have to, to get on the air.

32:25.513 --> 32:29.262
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle.
I live in Tulsa." Where's that?

32:29.434 --> 32:34.594
- In Oklahoma. Where is that?
- Somewhere in the middle.

32:34.772 --> 32:39.980
I won't think about
what they don't teach you at school.

32:40.153 --> 32:45.693
I think we should rule out
anyone who doesn't live near here.

32:45.867 --> 32:49.911
She's willing to fly anywhere.

32:50.079 --> 32:56.283
Looks like my third-grade teacher.
She is my third-grade teacher!

32:57.045 --> 33:01.872
- Don't you want to read these?
- No. it's not how it's done.

33:02.050 --> 33:06.297
I'd rather see somebody I like.

33:06.471 --> 33:11.761
- Then I'd ask her out for a drink.
- Or a slice of pizza.

33:11.935 --> 33:17.605
No dinner on the first date. because
halfway through you could regret it.

33:17.774 --> 33:22.068
But if you like them after a drink,
you can always ask them to dinner.

33:22.237 --> 33:26.365
If not, you can say,
"That was great," and go home.

33:26.532 --> 33:31.693
You see? I wonder
if it still works this way.

33:31.871 --> 33:36.083
- It doesn't. They ask you.
- I'm starting to notice that.

33:36.251 --> 33:40.747
If you get a new wife,
you'll have sex with her, huh?

33:40.922 --> 33:47.126
- I certainly hope so.
- Will she scratch up your back?

33:47.303 --> 33:52.724
In movies women always scratch the
man's back and scream during sex.

33:52.892 --> 33:58.516
- How do you know this?
- Jed's got cable.

33:59.816 --> 34:03.399
Hand me that towel, please.

34:07.073 --> 34:12.862
Thank you. Let me get you.
"Jed's got cable!"

35:40.959 --> 35:46.498
Now to Dr. Fieldstone, psychologist
and the friend you never have.

35:46.673 --> 35:50.717
- Remember Marooned in Miami?
- He doesn't love me anymore.

35:50.885 --> 35:55.464
- Then why stay with him?
- Disappointed in Denver.

35:55.640 --> 35:59.887
When I come close to orgasm,
he goes to make a sandwich.

36:00.061 --> 36:04.059
- Make a sandwich beforehand.
- Sleepless in Seattle.

36:04.232 --> 36:12.488
I'll get up every morning
and breathe all day long.

36:13.199 --> 36:17.778
After a while I won't have to
remind myself-

36:17.954 --> 36:22.532
- to get up and breathe in and out.

36:24.419 --> 36:29.377
Then after a while I won't
have to think about-

36:29.549 --> 36:33.712
- howl had it great and perfect
for a while.

36:33.887 --> 36:37.386
Why was your wife so special?

36:38.266 --> 36:42.975
How long is your program?

36:43.146 --> 36:49.065
It was a million little things.

36:49.235 --> 36:53.862
When you added them up, it meant
we were meant for each other.

36:54.032 --> 36:58.741
I knew it,
the first time I touched her.

36:58.912 --> 37:04.333
It was like coming home,
only to no home I'd ever known.

37:04.500 --> 37:10.705
I was just taking her hand
to help her out of a car.

37:10.882 --> 37:16.089
And I knew it.
It was like ...

37:16.262 --> 37:19.880
... magic.

37:39.452 --> 37:43.995
I think I'm going crazy, Dennis.
Are you happily married?

37:44.165 --> 37:48.993
Why did you get married?
Was it trumpets and fireworks?

37:49.170 --> 37:54.046
Betsy said we had to break up
or get married. That's why.

37:54.926 --> 37:59.089
When you met, did you think
she was the only one for you?

37:59.264 --> 38:02.383
That in some way it was fated?

38:02.559 --> 38:06.343
Annie. attraction is -

38:06.521 --> 38:11.562
- when your subconscious is
attracted to their subconscious.

38:11.734 --> 38:16.895
Fate is to neuroses
knowing they're a perfect match.

38:17.073 --> 38:23.194
I'm having all these fantasies
about a man I never even met!

38:23.371 --> 38:27.499
- And he lives in Seattle!
- It rains nine months a year there.

38:27.667 --> 38:32.662
I know. I won't move to Seattle.

38:35.466 --> 38:41.836
But I don't want to end up wondering
what might have happened.

38:42.015 --> 38:46.760
What do you think?
It's cold feet. isn't it?

38:46.936 --> 38:51.432
- Everybody panics. Didn't you?
- Yes. I did.

38:51.608 --> 38:57.361
Thanks. Dennis. I feel better now.

38:57.947 --> 39:03.404
Sandy's friend is a weightlifter,
but her neck isn't that big.

39:03.578 --> 39:10.660
No, don't set me up. I want to know
what it's like out there.

39:10.835 --> 39:15.912
Women are looking
for pecs and a cute butt.

39:16.090 --> 39:20.302
"He has the cutest butt."
Where did I hear that recently?

39:20.470 --> 39:27.219
Everywhere. Even on the news
women talk about cute butts.

39:27.393 --> 39:30.845
It's really caught on.

39:31.022 --> 39:34.557
So how's my butt?

39:35.693 --> 39:39.027
- Not bad.
- Is it cute though?

39:39.197 --> 39:41.604
Are we grading on a curve?

39:42.825 --> 39:47.203
When was your last date?

39:48.539 --> 39:52.489
Jimmy Carter ... 1978.

39:52.669 --> 39:58.422
Things are different now.
First you have to be friends.

39:58.591 --> 40:02.423
Then you neck.
This could go on for years.

40:02.595 --> 40:07.138
Then you have tests and do it with a
condom. But you do split the check.

40:08.059 --> 40:13.136
- I can't let a woman pay.
- They'll throw a parade for you.

40:13.314 --> 40:17.478
You'll be Man of the Year.

40:17.652 --> 40:22.693
Tira misu.
You'll find out what that is.

40:22.865 --> 40:27.278
Some woman will want me to do it
to her. and I won't know what it is.

40:27.453 --> 40:34.583
- You'll love it.
- This is going to be tough.

40:34.752 --> 40:41.206
What about that decorator?
She's perky.

40:41.384 --> 40:47.885
No. I'm far away from that.
I'm just making notes.

40:48.057 --> 40:53.218
- How would I do it?
- Ask her over to look at swatches.

40:53.396 --> 40:58.307
- To look at swatches?
- Yeah. colour schemes.

40:58.484 --> 41:04.274
Don't do it like I did. Be suave.
Think Cary Grant.

41:04.449 --> 41:08.696
Would he say,
"Come look at my swatches"?

41:08.870 --> 41:13.828
- Not it in movies ...
- Not in "Gunga Din"?

41:14.000 --> 41:18.543
"Gunga Din" isn't that kind of film.
Who knows what he did in real life.

41:18.713 --> 41:24.052
- He did that with Dyan Cannon?
- "Dyan, look at these swatches."

41:42.654 --> 41:45.227
Jonah. I'm home!

41:47.951 --> 41:50.442
Jonah?

42:08.471 --> 42:11.757
Hi. Dad. This is Jessica.

42:11.933 --> 42:15.266
Nice to meet you.

42:15.436 --> 42:20.394
This is amazing. If you play this
backwards, it says "Paul is dead."

42:20.567 --> 42:26.106
- Yeah. I know.
- How do you know?

42:27.115 --> 42:31.777
- Dad, could you shut the door?
- Sure.

42:31.953 --> 42:37.707
H and G.
Hi and goodbye.

43:50.448 --> 43:53.402
Hello. Victoria?

43:53.576 --> 43:59.033
This is Sam Baldwin.
I don't know if you remember me ...

43:59.207 --> 44:03.157
Oh, great.

44:03.336 --> 44:10.169
I was wondering if you would like
to have a drink with me?

44:10.343 --> 44:12.799
Dinner?

44:12.971 --> 44:16.636
Dinner would be even better.

44:16.808 --> 44:20.259
Friday would be great.

44:20.436 --> 44:24.137
I hear that's a good place.

44:25.358 --> 44:29.984
Seven-thirty is fine. And I'll ...

44:31.948 --> 44:36.076
Okay, I'll meet you there.

44:36.244 --> 44:42.697
So it's Friday
at seven-thirty for dinner. Great.

44:44.335 --> 44:47.835
Me, too. Bye.

44:53.177 --> 44:59.595
- Are you in love with him?
- Not now.

44:59.767 --> 45:05.687
- Those people knew how to love.
- You're a basket case.

45:05.857 --> 45:12.109
They knew it. Nothing could
separate them because they knew.

45:12.280 --> 45:15.863
- It was real.
- It's a movie.

45:16.034 --> 45:21.704
You don't want to be in love.
you want to be in a movie. Read it.

45:22.832 --> 45:27.161
"Dear Sleepless and Son. I've never
written a letter like this before."

45:27.337 --> 45:33.007
- That's what everyone writes.
- You think I don't know that?

45:33.843 --> 45:36.797
What about Walter?

45:36.971 --> 45:40.969
I'd give anything to marry Walter.

45:41.142 --> 45:47.346
He's so unexpected. You think
you know him, but you don't.

45:48.191 --> 45:51.275
I should write about magic.

45:51.444 --> 45:56.272
What if this man is my destiny,
and I never meet him?

45:56.449 --> 46:01.158
- Your destiny can be your doom.
- "I want to meet you ..."

46:01.329 --> 46:06.240
- At the Empire State Building.
- At the Empire State Building.

46:06.417 --> 46:09.952
Sunset, Valentine's Day.

46:10.129 --> 46:14.258
I'll be in New York with Walter.
I can squeeze it in.

46:14.425 --> 46:18.209
I'll be in New York with Walter!

46:24.352 --> 46:30.188
Because of fate I married Martin and
bought the house with the dead tree.

46:30.358 --> 46:34.605
On account of which I got divorced
and hit a car -

46:34.779 --> 46:38.195
- and met Rick.
while buying a neck brace.

46:38.366 --> 46:41.984
You got divorced because of a tree?

46:42.161 --> 46:45.577
- The tree man.
- You fell in love with him?

46:45.748 --> 46:51.787
I did not say love.
This is my favourite part.

46:52.922 --> 46:59.257
- It's now or never.
- Never is a frightening word.

46:59.429 --> 47:03.972
We'd be fools to let
happiness pass us by.

47:05.184 --> 47:10.309
Winter must be cold
for those with no warm memories.

47:11.608 --> 47:15.652
We've already missed the spring.

47:16.738 --> 47:21.779
- Men never get this movie.
- I know.

47:22.785 --> 47:25.537
Mummy! Mummy!

47:27.790 --> 47:34.540
- Mummy!
- It's okay. I'm here. I'm coming.

47:36.549 --> 47:40.713
It's okay. What was that about?

47:40.887 --> 47:46.391
Our house was sinking. There was
water coming in all the windows.

47:47.977 --> 47:52.723
Well, it's okay now.

47:53.858 --> 48:00.062
What shall we do? Your mother sang
to when you had bad dreams.

48:00.990 --> 48:04.774
"Bye Bye Blackbird".

48:06.329 --> 48:11.406
I miss her. What happens
to someone after they die?

48:12.919 --> 48:17.830
- I don't know.
- Do you believe in heaven?

48:20.134 --> 48:26.884
I never believed in an afterlife.
But now. I don't know.

48:27.600 --> 48:33.970
Because I've had these dreams
about your mum.

48:35.066 --> 48:40.191
We have long talks ... about you.

48:40.363 --> 48:46.651
How you're doing. She sort of
knows, but I tell her anyway.

48:46.828 --> 48:53.281
So what is that?
It's sort of an afterlife. isn't it?

48:54.335 --> 48:59.163
I'm starting to forget her.

49:12.353 --> 49:17.229
She could peel an apple -

49:17.400 --> 49:22.643
- in one long, curly strip.

49:23.865 --> 49:27.993
The whole apple.

49:38.046 --> 49:43.420
- I love you, Jonah.
- I love you, Dad.

49:49.474 --> 49:52.558
See you tomorrow.

51:04.924 --> 51:10.760
Laurie? It's Annie.
I'm fine.

51:10.930 --> 51:18.226
I'm writing about radio shows.
Do you know Dr. Fieldstone?

51:18.396 --> 51:24.232
I work for the Baltimore Sun. and
I'm doing a piece on bereavement.

51:24.402 --> 51:28.352
I understand
you had a caller from Seattle ...

51:36.623 --> 51:41.664
This is 'Jonah Baldwin.
We're not in right now...

52:44.440 --> 52:47.940
Architect.

53:19.893 --> 53:26.310
I'll be back either by midnight
or 8:30. if disaster strikes.

53:26.482 --> 53:30.895
- Here's one for both of us.
- "Sleepless and Son, Baltimore."

53:31.070 --> 53:34.605
Here's the doctor's number.

53:34.782 --> 53:39.859
Here's a bottle of ipecac
if anybody drinks poison.

53:40.038 --> 53:44.949
How do I look?
Do I look all right?

53:45.126 --> 53:50.631
I look stupid. I'm trying too hard.
I was going to get a haircut.

53:50.798 --> 53:55.591
- This is a good letter, Dad.
- These heels are grotesque.

53:55.762 --> 53:58.798
Her name is Annie Reed.

53:58.973 --> 54:02.508
Dad. read this.

54:04.145 --> 54:08.225
"Dear Sleepless and Son ..."

54:08.399 --> 54:13.026
"I'm an excellent third baseman.
and let me tell you, -

54:13.196 --> 54:18.024
- Robinson was the best. We must
agree on this. I'm from Baltimore."

54:18.201 --> 54:23.444
She likes Brooks Robinson.
So do you. It's a sign.

54:23.623 --> 54:28.249
Come here. I'll show you a sign.

54:30.964 --> 54:37.251
Where's Seattle?
And Baltimore? Right there!

54:37.428 --> 54:42.671
There's like 26 states between
here and there. That's a sign.

54:42.850 --> 54:47.892
I'm out of here. Goodbye.
I love you.

54:50.817 --> 54:55.360
Clarise, did you move your car?

55:02.912 --> 55:07.989
- Thanks. Derrick. I'll have ...
- White wine spritzer?

55:08.167 --> 55:11.583
- And you, sir?
- I'm fine.

55:11.754 --> 55:16.749
- You look good.
- So do you.

55:19.971 --> 55:23.091
I thought you'd never call me.

55:23.266 --> 55:26.551
I really wanted you to.

55:26.728 --> 55:32.600
Mr. Baldwin, phone call for you.

55:39.240 --> 55:44.531
Dad, can we go to New York
for Valentine's Day?

55:44.704 --> 55:50.707
Annie Reed wants to meet us at the
top of the Empire State Building.

55:50.877 --> 55:57.876
Jonah, have you fallen down?
Has Clarise been strangled?

55:58.051 --> 56:01.135
- No.
- Is that the reason you're calling?

56:01.304 --> 56:06.643
We can get cheap tickets
from Jessica's parents.

56:06.809 --> 56:11.056
We'll talk about it later.

56:11.231 --> 56:16.391
This conversation has lasted
too long. Go to bed.

56:22.033 --> 56:26.410
- Everything all right?
- Yes. Do you have kids?

56:26.579 --> 56:29.782
You want mine?

56:30.667 --> 56:34.914
I'll have an Absolut straight up.

56:51.563 --> 56:55.228
Put that down. Stop it!

56:55.400 --> 56:59.528
- There she is.
- Why is she bringing groceries?

56:59.696 --> 57:04.773
- She's going to cook for us.
- Hi. Sam.

57:04.951 --> 57:08.996
Let me guess. You must be Jonah.

57:11.874 --> 57:16.335
This is it? The car is this way.

57:16.504 --> 57:23.420
She's on her sixth painter. And now
she wants the fireplace rebricked.

57:23.595 --> 57:30.131
- I know her. I could call her.
- I'll just hit her with a brick.

57:32.645 --> 57:35.682
That's so funny. You're so funny.

57:35.857 --> 57:41.895
When she wants something done
she says: "You know best."

57:42.071 --> 57:47.314
"But couldn't we flip the house
so the back is in front?"

57:47.493 --> 57:53.579
"Put the front on a hinge so I can
get in with a garage door opener."

57:53.750 --> 58:00.037
- "Yes, we can. We'll just ..."
- "Move the cabinets."

58:07.222 --> 58:10.970
Jonah, bring some of that stuff.

58:11.142 --> 58:14.178
Do you like baseball?

58:14.354 --> 58:19.265
Yes. In fact my firm has box seats
to the Mariners. Let's go some day.

58:20.985 --> 58:25.813
What about camping?
Do you like that?

58:25.990 --> 58:28.777
I went camping once.

58:28.952 --> 58:34.705
- We should go camping more often.
- You're right. Time for bed.

58:34.874 --> 58:39.453
- It's only 10:00.
- That's right. Time for bed.

58:39.629 --> 58:42.630
Goodnight.

58:44.259 --> 58:48.256
Thank Victoria for the nice dinner.

58:48.429 --> 58:53.506
Thanks for dinner. I never saw
anybody cook potatoes that way.

58:53.685 --> 58:59.438
I'm glad you liked it.
Goodnight, Jonah.

59:00.733 --> 59:06.688
We don't see a lot of potatoes here.
We're rice men.

01:00:00.210 --> 01:00:03.460
I'm sorry, Walter. I'm sorry.

01:00:08.176 --> 01:00:10.797
Turn on your radio.

01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:15.965
The kid is on. You've got me
listening to this garbage!

01:00:16.893 --> 01:00:23.975
Becky's having trouble with Rick.
Becky, I'll call you back.

01:00:26.819 --> 01:00:31.316
I'm sorry, Walter.
Are you bleeding?

01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:53.677
He's kissing her right now!

01:00:53.846 --> 01:00:57.630
Are you spying on your father?.

01:00:57.809 --> 01:01:02.850
- Who is he kissing?
- I have to make them stop.

01:01:03.022 --> 01:01:07.150
- How will I explain this to Walter?
- She made dinner.

01:01:07.318 --> 01:01:10.521
She brought food for a whole year!

01:01:10.697 --> 01:01:15.193
It's good that your father's dating.
It's just hard on you.

01:01:15.368 --> 01:01:19.745
You think you want it,
but when it happens, it scares you.

01:01:19.914 --> 01:01:25.371
Shouldn't your father decide
whether someone is right for him?

01:01:25.545 --> 01:01:27.834
He's not sane enough.

01:01:28.006 --> 01:01:33.878
He's kissing her on the lips.
My dad's been captured by a 'ho!

01:01:34.053 --> 01:01:38.762
Calm down. Tomorrow,
when you're having breakfast, -

01:01:38.933 --> 01:01:44.806
- tell him how you feel.
Don't keep it inside.

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:53.939
Miss Scarlett. In the broom closet.
With the radio.

01:01:54.115 --> 01:01:59.655
Walter, you scared me.
Don't ever do that again.

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:07.286
- I saw a black widow.
- You scared me and Victoria.

01:02:07.462 --> 01:02:12.420
- It was right there.
- Next time I want you to say:

01:02:12.592 --> 01:02:16.886
"Dad, I see a poisonous insect."

01:02:17.055 --> 01:02:20.506
And I'll deal with it. Don't scream.

01:02:20.683 --> 01:02:25.179
Becky thought Rick was on the radio.

01:02:25.355 --> 01:02:31.274
It turned out the guy lived
in Duluth. Where's Duluth?

01:02:31.444 --> 01:02:35.905
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I know. No sense at all.

01:02:36.074 --> 01:02:41.779
- Thank God my life is in place.
- Duluth? That's in North Dakota.

01:02:56.135 --> 01:03:01.047
- Great letter. Write to her.
- You think so?

01:03:01.224 --> 01:03:06.728
It's Y-O-H.
Your only hope.

01:03:18.449 --> 01:03:23.870
I thought I'd do a story
on those radio shows.

01:03:24.038 --> 01:03:28.665
- You'd have to go somewhere.
- Definitely.

01:03:47.562 --> 01:03:51.939
- Can't you do a phone interview?
- No.

01:03:52.108 --> 01:03:56.402
- I won't be in Chicago long.
- When you get back, I'll be gone.

01:03:56.571 --> 01:04:00.699
- Then I'll see you in New York.
- I'll get it ...

01:04:04.871 --> 01:04:09.948
This is Captain Browning.
We're cruising at 35,000 feet.

01:04:10.126 --> 01:04:15.583
The weather is clear
and we'll be in Seattle on schedule.

01:04:15.757 --> 01:04:23.633
- Don't you hate flying?
- Yes. and I've told a terrible lie.

01:04:23.806 --> 01:04:27.756
Is any lie a betrayal?

01:04:27.936 --> 01:04:32.265
I said flying.

01:04:37.445 --> 01:04:41.858
- Thanks for bringing me here.
- He likes the planes.

01:04:42.033 --> 01:04:48.830
Can I bring you back a souvenir?
Maybe one of these snow globes?

01:04:48.998 --> 01:04:53.826
Sure, I'd really like that.
Thank you so much.

01:04:55.255 --> 01:04:58.873
- He's eight.
- He's good at it.

01:04:59.050 --> 01:05:04.092
I've read an article about it.
Children are hideous at that age.

01:05:04.264 --> 01:05:11.227
Maybe when I come back, the to of
us ought to spend some time alone.

01:05:15.733 --> 01:05:18.853
Bye. Bye, Jonah.

01:05:24.117 --> 01:05:26.323
Jonah.

01:05:26.494 --> 01:05:29.993
Listen, you don't know Victoria.

01:05:30.164 --> 01:05:35.289
In fact she's a mystery to me, too.

01:05:35.461 --> 01:05:39.506
She tosses her hair a lot. Why?

01:05:39.674 --> 01:05:44.669
Is it a titch? Does she need
a haircut or a barrette?

01:05:46.306 --> 01:05:53.720
I'd like to understand these things.
And that's why I'm dating her.

01:05:53.897 --> 01:05:59.271
Just dating. I'm not living
with her. I'm not marrying her.

01:05:59.444 --> 01:06:02.979
Can you appreciate the difference?

01:06:03.156 --> 01:06:07.782
That's what single people do.
They see how other people fit.

01:06:07.952 --> 01:06:14.536
Everyone's an adjustment. There's
no such thing as a perfect ...

01:06:29.891 --> 01:06:33.474
Come on.

01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:40.604
Dad, Jessica says
you knew Annie in another life.

01:06:40.777 --> 01:06:45.569
The one who wrote us. But you
never got together in that life.

01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:51.659
Your hearts will be a complete
puzzle once you're together.

01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:58.662
I know that because I'm young and
pure, in touch with cosmic forces.

01:06:58.836 --> 01:07:04.376
Who told you that? I sure hope
you're not marrying Jessica.

01:09:48.046 --> 01:09:52.875
- I watched them play at the beach.
- Did you talk to him?

01:09:53.051 --> 01:09:56.635
Couldn't do it.

01:09:56.806 --> 01:10:02.512
- How did I get here?
- You lied and got on a plane.

01:10:03.771 --> 01:10:11.103
- I'm going to talk to him tomorrow.
- Okay. Good. Goodbye.

01:10:11.279 --> 01:10:14.695
Beck ...

01:10:15.366 --> 01:10:21.202
- Is this crazy?
- No, that's the weirdest part

01:10:21.372 --> 01:10:27.493
- Thank you. I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:11:29.899 --> 01:11:34.193
It's good to see you. Where's Greg?

01:11:57.093 --> 01:12:01.173
Hello.

01:12:07.854 --> 01:12:12.231
- Then what?
- I left, obviously.

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:18.154
- You were in the street?
- It was like walking around naked.

01:12:18.323 --> 01:12:23.993
- I love that dream.
- This was more humiliating.

01:12:24.162 --> 01:12:28.206
But he saw you.
You were face to face.

01:12:28.374 --> 01:12:35.207
He said hello.
And all I could say was hello.

01:12:36.132 --> 01:12:41.719
- All I could say was hello.
- It's a sign.

01:12:41.888 --> 01:12:47.013
It's a sign that I've watched
this movie too many times.

01:12:47.185 --> 01:12:53.804
From the minute I heard that program
I've been a complete jerk.

01:12:53.983 --> 01:12:57.851
- You're not a jerk.
- Thank you. An idiot!

01:12:58.029 --> 01:13:03.783
- You don't know who she was.
- I have a picture of her.

01:13:03.952 --> 01:13:10.286
The detective sent it to me.
See. that's what she looks like.

01:13:11.167 --> 01:13:16.292
- It's her back.
- It's her and he's crazy about her.

01:13:16.464 --> 01:13:21.375
What's this?
It's from Seattle.

01:13:28.434 --> 01:13:31.139
Becky.

01:13:32.230 --> 01:13:35.681
So I mailed your letter ...

01:13:36.401 --> 01:13:42.439
"Dear Annie. Thanks for your letter.
You sound neat."

01:13:45.743 --> 01:13:50.904
"We're excited about meeting you
in New York, and seeing if we're ...

01:13:51.082 --> 01:13:55.543
... M-F-E-O."

01:13:55.712 --> 01:13:59.923
"See you soon.
Sleepless in Seattle."

01:14:00.091 --> 01:14:04.136
M-F-E-O?

01:14:05.930 --> 01:14:09.548
Made for each other.

01:14:09.726 --> 01:14:12.892
It's cute. Like a little clue.

01:14:17.483 --> 01:14:20.852
So he can't write. Big deal.

01:14:21.029 --> 01:14:26.699
Verbal ability is overrated in guys.
Our need for it leads to trouble.

01:14:26.868 --> 01:14:31.909
- I'm going to run back to Walter.
- And the letter?

01:14:32.081 --> 01:14:36.874
It was written before I went
out there. Before the 'ho.

01:14:39.505 --> 01:14:46.504
But she didn't look like a 'ho.
She looked like one of our friends.

01:14:50.225 --> 01:14:56.014
- You saw her in the airport, too?
- It was like I knew her.

01:14:56.189 --> 01:15:01.610
- Like a deja-vu?
- It was very deja-vu-ish.

01:15:01.778 --> 01:15:07.448
- At least you're seeing people.
- Well, only one ...

01:15:07.617 --> 01:15:11.745
- Victoria.
- You don't like her?

01:15:11.913 --> 01:15:17.204
- She laughs like a hyena.
- Is this true?

01:15:17.377 --> 01:15:21.540
Sort of. Tell them what you did.

01:15:21.714 --> 01:15:24.964
Tell them about the radio show.

01:15:25.134 --> 01:15:28.883
Christmas Eve he calls a radio show.

01:15:29.055 --> 01:15:35.936
- And tells them I need a new wife.
- That's so sweet.

01:15:36.104 --> 01:15:40.184
Now he's obsessed with
a woman who wrote me.

01:15:40.358 --> 01:15:45.565
She wants to meet me on top of
Empire State on Valentines Day.

01:15:45.738 --> 01:15:51.362
It's like that movie.
"An Affair to Remember".

01:15:51.536 --> 01:15:56.613
Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.
Is that "car" or "cur"?

01:15:59.961 --> 01:16:05.715
They were to meet at the Empire
State, but she got hit by a taxi.

01:16:05.884 --> 01:16:10.759
He waited and waited.
And it was raining.

01:16:10.930 --> 01:16:17.384
Then she's too proud
to tell him that she's ...

01:16:19.772 --> 01:16:25.645
... crippled. And he's too proud
to find out why she doesn't come.

01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:29.688
But he comes to see her anyway.

01:16:29.866 --> 01:16:34.575
It's amazing when he visits her.

01:16:34.746 --> 01:16:39.455
He doesn't notice that she
doesn't get up to say hello.

01:16:39.626 --> 01:16:42.876
And he's very bitter.

01:16:43.046 --> 01:16:47.921
You think he's going to walk out
and never know why.

01:16:48.092 --> 01:16:56.302
She's just lying there with
a blanket over her shriveled legs.

01:16:58.394 --> 01:17:01.598
- Are you all right?
- She's fine.

01:17:01.773 --> 01:17:08.226
The he says, "I saw the painting,"
and goes into the bedroom.

01:17:08.404 --> 01:17:12.354
And he comes out and looks at her.

01:17:12.533 --> 01:17:17.030
And they just know
and hug and it's so ...

01:17:17.205 --> 01:17:20.823
- That's a chick's movie.
- I'd say so.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:26.873
- Who'd write a guy from the radio?
- I got hundreds of letters.

01:17:27.048 --> 01:17:31.757
- Desperate women.
- Is wanting a nice guy desperate?

01:17:31.928 --> 01:17:37.384
It's easier to be killed
by terrorists than to marry over 40.

01:17:37.559 --> 01:17:41.971
- That is not true!
- Right, honey.

01:17:42.146 --> 01:17:47.603
I don't want a mail-order bride.
Just someone who can converse -

01:17:47.777 --> 01:17:53.613
- without falling into
weepy tears over an old movie.

01:17:53.783 --> 01:17:59.821
I cried over "The Dirty Dozen".
Jim Brown throwing the grenades.

01:17:59.998 --> 01:18:05.621
Richard Jaeckel and Lee Marvin
on top of a tank dressed like nazis.

01:18:07.338 --> 01:18:14.337
Trini Lopez ... breaks his neck
when they're parachuting.

01:18:14.512 --> 01:18:19.340
Richard Jaeckel had on a shiny
helmet. because he was an MP.

01:18:19.517 --> 01:18:24.263
Please. no more.
God. I love that movie.

01:18:32.655 --> 01:18:37.364
- This is the best movie I ever saw.
- What's so great about it?

01:18:37.535 --> 01:18:42.197
- You have to find her.
- How much would it cost to go?

01:18:42.373 --> 01:18:47.035
Nobody knows.
It changes practically every day.

01:18:47.212 --> 01:18:50.497
- How much money do you have?
- 80 dollars.

01:18:50.673 --> 01:18:56.676
- I have 42. That'll cover cabs.
- How would I get there?

01:18:56.846 --> 01:19:02.600
I have to drop these tickets off.
Can you keep an eye on things?

01:19:12.946 --> 01:19:16.231
- Window seat or aisle?
- Window.

01:19:16.407 --> 01:19:21.200
You want a fruit plate? I'd rather
die than eat airplane food.

01:19:21.371 --> 01:19:25.665
I'll write you're 12.
That way you can fly unaccompanied.

01:19:25.833 --> 01:19:32.417
- Who'd believe I'm 12?
- They'll believe the computer.

01:19:32.590 --> 01:19:38.047
I'll say you're short for your age,
but that they shouldn't mention it.

01:19:38.221 --> 01:19:40.463
Great idea!

01:20:00.743 --> 01:20:04.611
- You'll miss the train.
- No I won't.

01:20:04.789 --> 01:20:10.294
I'm so happy, Becky.
This is right. It's real.

01:20:10.461 --> 01:20:15.622
The other things happen in movies.

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:19.845
Don't tell anyone what I did.
I'd die -

01:20:20.013 --> 01:20:26.431
- if anyone knew I did anything
like that. You promise?

01:20:26.603 --> 01:20:30.850
Sleepless in Seattle is history.

01:21:03.264 --> 01:21:06.467
- Go ahead.
- No, you go.

01:21:06.643 --> 01:21:10.890
I was going to say
that since Christmas -

01:21:11.064 --> 01:21:15.013
- you've been kind of distracted.

01:21:15.193 --> 01:21:21.480
But now it feels as if you're coming
back from wherever you were.

01:21:21.658 --> 01:21:24.943
I am.

01:21:25.119 --> 01:21:31.158
I was just ...
I think I got nervous.

01:21:31.876 --> 01:21:38.757
But that's normal, right?
Don't you ever feel nervous ...

01:21:39.926 --> 01:21:44.884
- About what?
- Forever.

01:21:45.557 --> 01:21:48.723
No.

01:21:50.436 --> 01:21:55.182
Well ... I did.

01:21:55.358 --> 01:22:00.649
And I think I thought
it was too perfect.

01:22:00.822 --> 01:22:06.527
I was afraid we'd be to rights
making a wrong.

01:22:06.703 --> 01:22:13.500
You know. it was like kismet.
but not, if you see what I mean.

01:22:13.668 --> 01:22:18.663
You have to grow up and forget
the adolescent fantasies about -

01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:23.383
- how exciting life will be.
I'm sorry, but I love this pattern.

01:22:23.553 --> 01:22:28.298
You couldn't. This is just
like my grandmother's china.

01:22:28.474 --> 01:22:32.971
- How many place settings?
- Ten.

01:22:35.064 --> 01:22:41.731
Exactly. Eight is too few,
twelve is too many.

01:23:04.636 --> 01:23:09.179
- Walter ...
- It was my mother's.

01:23:10.141 --> 01:23:15.895
I had them size it down.
She had really fat fingers.

01:23:18.358 --> 01:23:22.605
It's so beautiful.
It's exactly what I'd pick -

01:23:22.779 --> 01:23:28.021
- if I had every ring
in the world to choose from.

01:23:29.035 --> 01:23:33.827
Some people want a relationship
to be full of surprises, -

01:23:33.998 --> 01:23:38.245
- but I'm not one of them.

01:23:38.878 --> 01:23:43.457
Surprises are highly overrated.

01:23:44.384 --> 01:23:44.425
I'll only be gone one night.
Clarise will be here ...

01:23:44.425 --> 01:23:49.301
I'll only be gone one night.
Clarise will be here ...

01:23:49.472 --> 01:23:53.422
You can watch scary movies.

01:23:53.601 --> 01:23:58.512
- Are you going with her?
- I'm going with Victoria.

01:24:00.858 --> 01:24:04.477
Don't try anything tricky.

01:24:06.698 --> 01:24:13.234
Don't roll in poison ivy or
do anything so you need stitches.

01:24:13.413 --> 01:24:20.246
If your finger falls off, it stays
off. I won't take you to hospital.

01:24:21.170 --> 01:24:25.334
- Is this about that woman?
- Annie.

01:24:28.887 --> 01:24:33.216
- I don't care what you do!
- I'll tell you what I'm doing.

01:24:33.391 --> 01:24:39.394
I'm getting laid. I'm the only man
in the 90's who's getting laid.

01:24:39.564 --> 01:24:45.151
And I haven't been laid that much.
Six or seven girls at college.

01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:49.317
How long have you been there?
What did you hear me say?

01:24:49.490 --> 01:24:54.947
-"Six-seven girls at college."
- Seven ... Eight! Mary Kelly.

01:24:55.121 --> 01:24:59.249
This is the one I like.

01:24:59.417 --> 01:25:04.293
Jonah, you won't like any woman,
because it isn't your mother.

01:25:04.464 --> 01:25:09.754
- What's wrong with Annie?
- Jonah, shut up.

01:25:09.928 --> 01:25:15.930
Shut up? Mum never told me
to shut up or yelled at me.

01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:19.018
This conversation is over!

01:25:19.187 --> 01:25:25.770
This woman could be a sick lunatic.
Didn't you see "Fatal Attraction"?

01:25:25.944 --> 01:25:31.733
- You wouldn't let me.
- It scared every man in America.

01:25:33.743 --> 01:25:37.871
I'm not leaving till you say yes.

01:25:41.834 --> 01:25:44.076
I hate you!

01:25:44.254 --> 01:25:48.203
Good, then you can tell Oprah
how your dad ruined your life -

01:25:48.383 --> 01:25:52.546
- by going of for a weekend
special at the Holiday Inn!

01:26:07.068 --> 01:26:12.228
Jonah. Clarise is here
and I've got to go.

01:26:21.165 --> 01:26:27.002
Jonah. Listen.
I've got to go ...

01:26:54.240 --> 01:27:00.243
Jessica. tell us where he is.
Jonah's dad is very upset.

01:27:00.413 --> 01:27:05.834
Jessica, this is your father.
Tell us where he is.

01:27:07.712 --> 01:27:11.046
- N-Y.
- That means "no way".

01:27:11.216 --> 01:27:14.086
That's N-W!

01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:19.468
- He's on his way to New York.
- How?

01:27:19.641 --> 01:27:22.677
United. 597.

01:27:22.852 --> 01:27:26.517
- When does it leave?
- 7:30.

01:27:32.445 --> 01:27:36.906
Here's a pin for flying with us.

01:27:37.075 --> 01:27:40.859
- Can I take this for you?
- No.

01:27:55.218 --> 01:27:59.216
- Where to. kid?
- Empire State Building.

01:27:59.389 --> 01:28:03.718
- Empire State Building.
- Don't stop so close to the curb.

01:28:05.728 --> 01:28:10.936
There it is. What are you going
to do up there? Spit off the top?

01:28:11.109 --> 01:28:14.312
No, I'm meeting my new mother.

01:28:34.465 --> 01:28:40.420
- I'm Jonah. Are you Annie?
- No, I'm Cynthia.

01:28:46.769 --> 01:28:50.981
Excuse me, are you Annie?

01:29:27.810 --> 01:29:30.930
Great table. Thanks.

01:29:32.148 --> 01:29:35.019
Is something wrong?

01:29:35.193 --> 01:29:39.237
- Can I get you a drink?
- Champagne?

01:29:39.405 --> 01:29:41.979
Fine.

01:29:42.158 --> 01:29:46.370
We'll have a bottle of Dom DeLuise.

01:29:48.748 --> 01:29:53.743
- Just kidding.
- He meant Dom Perignon.

01:29:56.005 --> 01:29:59.125
Beautiful view.

01:29:59.300 --> 01:30:03.843
Walter ...
There's something I must tell you.

01:30:18.486 --> 01:30:21.772
Sorry, an emergency.

01:30:21.948 --> 01:30:26.076
Money, money, money, see?

01:31:41.486 --> 01:31:46.444
So he could be on top of
the Empire State Building now?

01:31:46.616 --> 01:31:52.322
No. I guess he could be ... No.

01:31:52.956 --> 01:31:58.958
It's not him. Walter. It's me.
I can't do this.

01:32:00.755 --> 01:32:07.552
Annie, I love you.
But let's leave that out of this.

01:32:08.513 --> 01:32:15.310
I don't want to be someone that you
or anybody else settles for.

01:32:17.313 --> 01:32:22.770
Marriage is hard enough
without such low expectations.

01:32:22.944 --> 01:32:27.487
- Isn't it?
- Walter, I don't deserve you.

01:32:28.324 --> 01:32:32.192
No, I wouldn't put it that way.

01:32:32.370 --> 01:32:36.415
But ... okay.

01:32:50.847 --> 01:32:56.719
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:33:00.064 --> 01:33:03.314
- What?
- Look.

01:33:10.825 --> 01:33:14.870
- It's a sign.
- Who needed a sign?

01:33:15.038 --> 01:33:18.952
Walter, I have to go.

01:33:32.013 --> 01:33:35.180
Jonah!

01:33:37.810 --> 01:33:40.847
Dad!

01:33:54.035 --> 01:33:58.246
What if something happened to you?
What if I couldn't get to you?

01:33:58.414 --> 01:34:02.744
I'm sorry.

01:34:03.378 --> 01:34:08.799
What would I have done?
You're my family. You're all I have.

01:34:08.967 --> 01:34:11.588
I thought she'd be here.

01:34:11.761 --> 01:34:16.921
We're doing okay, right?
So far, have I done anything stupid?

01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:22.094
- Have I screwed it up for us?
- No.

01:35:13.323 --> 01:35:17.901
- Observation deck?
- Sorry, it's too late.

01:35:18.077 --> 01:35:23.617
- Please. I need to get up there.
- We're closing up.

01:35:28.379 --> 01:35:34.382
Can I just take a look?
I'm supposed to meet someone.

01:35:34.552 --> 01:35:39.547
He's probably not there, but if
I don't look, I'll always wonder.

01:35:39.724 --> 01:35:43.936
- Cary Grant, right?
- You know that movie?

01:35:44.103 --> 01:35:48.053
It's one of my wife's favourites.

01:35:54.989 --> 01:35:59.568
Maybe when we get home
we'll get a dog.

01:35:59.744 --> 01:36:05.533
- Wouldn't you like to have a dog?
- Sure.

01:36:17.428 --> 01:36:21.722
I'm sorry, ma'am. Empty.

01:36:22.642 --> 01:36:28.063
- Can I take a minute?
- Go ahead.

01:37:40.970 --> 01:37:44.838
I left it by the telescopes.

01:38:09.958 --> 01:38:15.628
It's you.
I saw you in the street.

01:38:15.797 --> 01:38:20.126
- Are you Annie?
- Yes.

01:38:22.929 --> 01:38:26.464
You're Annie?

01:38:27.475 --> 01:38:31.639
- This must be yours.
- I'm Jonah.

01:38:31.813 --> 01:38:36.724
- This is my dad. His name is Sam.
- Hi. Jonah.

01:38:37.735 --> 01:38:40.606
Sam ...

01:38:43.783 --> 01:38:48.825
- And who's this?
- Howard.

01:39:04.262 --> 01:39:07.880
We'd better go.

01:39:13.104 --> 01:39:16.140
Shall we?

01:40:01.569 --> 01:40:05.899
Sam ... It's nice to meet you.
