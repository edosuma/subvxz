Cleaned & corrected by Tronar

00:36.960 --> 00:38.450
Peter.

00:39.570 --> 00:43.060
Your momma wants to speak with you.

00:45.010 --> 00:49.310
Come on, Pete.
Take these fool things off.

01:22.680 --> 01:26.410
Why have you been fighting with
the other boys again, baby?

01:28.520 --> 01:30.150
Peter?

01:30.250 --> 01:33.850
They killed a little frog
that ain't done nothing.

01:34.090 --> 01:37.060
Smushed it with a stick.

01:37.860 --> 01:40.690
You're so like your daddy.

01:41.060 --> 01:43.390
You even look like him.

01:44.230 --> 01:46.720
And he was an angel.

01:47.770 --> 01:50.440
- Composed out of pure light.
- Mer?

01:50.540 --> 01:52.940
You got a present there
for Peter, don't you?

01:54.380 --> 01:56.430
Of course.

01:59.110 --> 02:00.710
There.

02:01.920 --> 02:04.210
I've got you covered, Pete.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.490
You open it up when I'm gone, okay?

02:12.390 --> 02:14.590
Your grandpa

02:15.030 --> 02:17.730
is gonna take such good care of you.

02:17.830 --> 02:22.100
At least until your daddy
comes back to get you.

02:25.470 --> 02:26.940
Take my hand.

02:30.410 --> 02:32.170
Peter.

02:33.250 --> 02:34.580
Pete, come on.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.880
Take my hand.

02:42.460 --> 02:43.860
Mom?

02:43.960 --> 02:46.930
No! No! No! No!

02:47.030 --> 02:48.360
Mom! No!

02:48.460 --> 02:50.000
- Come with me.
- No!

02:50.100 --> 02:52.330
No!

02:52.430 --> 02:54.200
You've got to stay here. Please.

02:54.300 --> 02:55.770
No...

02:56.670 --> 02:58.600
Okay?

03:17.490 --> 03:19.220
No.

03:35.280 --> 03:37.500
Mom!

08:27.370 --> 08:28.800
Drop it!

08:28.900 --> 08:30.630
Hey.

08:31.670 --> 08:33.909
- Drop it, now!
- Hey, cool, man. No problem.

08:34.010 --> 08:36.440
No problem at all.

08:36.840 --> 08:38.309
How do you know about this?

08:38.409 --> 08:40.049
I don't even know what that is.

08:40.150 --> 08:42.780
I'm just a junker, man.
I was just checking stuff out.

08:42.880 --> 08:45.220
You don't look like a junker.
You're wearing Ravager garb.

08:45.320 --> 08:46.590
This is just an outfit, man.

08:46.690 --> 08:49.260
- Ninja Turtle, you better stop poking me.
- What is your name?

08:49.360 --> 08:51.630
My name is Peter Quill, okay?
Dude, chill out.

08:51.730 --> 08:53.130
- Move!
- Why?

08:53.230 --> 08:55.530
Ronan may have questions for you.

08:55.630 --> 08:59.090
Hey, you know what? There's another
name you might know me by.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.800
Star-Lord.

09:02.900 --> 09:06.930
- Who?
- Star-Lord, man. Legendary outlaw.

09:07.610 --> 09:10.230
- Guys?
- Move!

09:10.680 --> 09:13.340
Forget this.

11:03.690 --> 11:05.660
Peter?

11:09.130 --> 11:10.600
What happened?

11:10.900 --> 11:13.020
Hey...

11:13.700 --> 11:15.190
I...

11:15.670 --> 11:17.540
- Bereet.
- Bereet!

11:17.640 --> 11:20.570
Look, I'm gonna be totally honest
with you. I forgot you're here.

11:44.030 --> 11:47.200
Scattered riots broke out
across the Kree Empire today

11:47.300 --> 11:50.800
protesting the recent peace
treaty signed by the Kree Emperor

11:50.900 --> 11:53.870
and Xandar's Nova Prime.

11:55.810 --> 11:57.740
Peter, you have call.

11:58.110 --> 12:00.240
- No, wait, don't!
- Quill?

12:02.250 --> 12:03.580
Hey, Yondu.

12:03.680 --> 12:05.750
I'm here on Morag.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.050
Ain't no Orb, ain't no you.

12:07.150 --> 12:09.320
Well, I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd save you the hassle.

12:09.420 --> 12:10.700
Well, where are you at now, boy?

12:10.790 --> 12:13.360
I feel really bad about this,
but I'm not gonna tell you that.

12:13.460 --> 12:15.960
- I slaved putting this deal together.
- Slaved?

12:16.060 --> 12:17.100
Making a few calls is "slaved"?
I mean, really?

12:17.200 --> 12:18.230
And now you're gonna rip me off!

12:18.330 --> 12:21.840
We do not do that to each other.
We're Ravagers. We got a code.

12:21.940 --> 12:24.670
Yeah, and that code is
"steal from everybody."

12:24.770 --> 12:26.640
- When I picked you up on Terra...
- "Picked me up."

12:26.740 --> 12:28.700
- ...these boys of mine wanted to eat you.
- Yeah?

12:28.780 --> 12:30.810
They ain't never tasted
any Terran before.

12:30.910 --> 12:33.150
I stopped them.
You're alive because of me!

12:33.250 --> 12:34.940
I will find you, I will...

12:35.250 --> 12:38.590
Put a bounty on him! Forty K.

12:38.690 --> 12:40.320
- But I want him back alive.
- Yeah, Cap.

12:40.420 --> 12:41.860
- Alive?
- That's what I said.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.290
I told you when you picked that kid up,
you should have delivered him

12:44.400 --> 12:47.060
like we was hired to do!
He was cargo!

12:47.160 --> 12:51.900
- You have always been soft on him.
- You're the only one I'm being soft on!

12:52.000 --> 12:54.770
Now, don't you worry about Mr. Quill.

12:54.870 --> 12:57.340
As soon as we get him back here,

12:57.470 --> 13:00.170
I'm gonna kill him myself.

13:00.270 --> 13:02.070
What we do need to worry about,

13:02.980 --> 13:05.880
is who else out there wants that Orb!

13:25.770 --> 13:28.530
They call me "terrorist,"

13:28.700 --> 13:31.800
"radical," "zealot,"

13:32.170 --> 13:35.800
because I obey the ancient
laws of my people, the Kree,

13:36.240 --> 13:39.650
and punish those who do not.

13:39.750 --> 13:42.880
Because I do not forgive your people

13:42.980 --> 13:45.970
for taking the life of my father,

13:46.090 --> 13:50.020
and his father,
and his father before him.

13:50.760 --> 13:55.760
A thousand years of war between
us will not be forgotten!

13:55.860 --> 13:59.160
You can't do this! Our government
signed a peace treaty.

13:59.870 --> 14:02.600
My government knows no shame.

14:03.240 --> 14:06.530
You Xandarians and your
culture are a disease.

14:07.470 --> 14:08.510
You

14:08.610 --> 14:10.910
will never rule Xandar.

14:11.010 --> 14:12.500
No.

14:12.910 --> 14:15.540
I will cure it!

14:28.260 --> 14:29.400
Ronan,

14:29.500 --> 14:31.360
Korath has returned.

14:31.460 --> 14:34.670
Master, he is a thief,

14:34.770 --> 14:36.840
an outlaw who calls himself Star-Lord.

14:36.940 --> 14:39.470
But we have discovered
he has an agreement

14:39.570 --> 14:42.380
to retrieve the Orb for
an intermediary known

14:42.480 --> 14:44.010
as The Broker.

14:44.110 --> 14:47.550
I promised Thanos I would
retrieve the Orb for him.

14:47.650 --> 14:50.710
Only then will he destroy Xandar for me.

14:51.150 --> 14:55.020
Nebula, go to Xandar
and get me the Orb.

14:55.320 --> 14:56.490
It will be my honor.

14:56.590 --> 14:58.080
It will be your doom.

14:58.960 --> 15:01.430
If this happens again,
you'll be facing our father

15:01.530 --> 15:03.230
without his prize.

15:03.330 --> 15:05.300
I'm a daughter of Thanos.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.530
Just like you.

15:06.630 --> 15:07.970
But I know Xandar.

15:08.070 --> 15:09.740
Ronan has already decreed that I...

15:09.840 --> 15:11.300
Do not speak for me.

15:13.340 --> 15:15.810
You will not fail.

15:19.150 --> 15:21.140
Have I ever?

15:36.160 --> 15:37.600
Xandarians.

15:37.700 --> 15:39.900
What a bunch of losers.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.570
All of them in a big hurry to
get from something stupid,

15:44.670 --> 15:46.910
to nothing at all. Pathetic.

15:47.010 --> 15:47.970
Look at this guy!

15:48.070 --> 15:49.640
Can you believe they call us criminals,

15:49.740 --> 15:52.080
when he's assaulting
us with that haircut?

15:52.180 --> 15:54.950
What is this thing?
Look how it thinks it's so cool.

15:55.050 --> 15:58.650
It's not cool to get help!
Walk by yourself, you little gargoyle.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.150
Look at Mr. Smiles over here.

16:01.350 --> 16:05.520
Where's your wife, old man?
What a class-A prevert.

16:06.230 --> 16:07.660
Right, Groot?

16:07.760 --> 16:08.830
Groot?

16:08.930 --> 16:10.830
Don't drink fountain water, you idiot.

16:10.930 --> 16:13.470
That's disgusting!

16:13.570 --> 16:15.500
Yes, you did. I just saw you doing it.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.190
Why are you lying?

16:20.310 --> 16:22.340
Looks like we got one.

16:22.440 --> 16:26.900
Okay, humie, how bad does
someone wanna find you?

16:27.910 --> 16:32.580
40,000 units?
Groot, we're gonna be rich.

16:46.100 --> 16:47.860
- Mr. Quill.
- Broker.

16:48.770 --> 16:50.240
The Orb.

16:51.640 --> 16:53.840
- As commissioned.
- Where's Yondu?

16:53.940 --> 16:55.680
Wanted to be here. Sends his love.

16:55.780 --> 16:56.810
And told me to tell you,

16:56.910 --> 16:59.610
that you got the best
eyebrows in the business.

17:01.350 --> 17:02.840
What is it?

17:03.120 --> 17:06.490
It's my policy never to discuss
my clients, or their needs.

17:06.589 --> 17:08.619
Yeah, well, I almost
died getting it for you.

17:08.720 --> 17:12.119
An occupational hazard,
I'm sure, in your line of work.

17:12.329 --> 17:15.060
Some machine-headed freak,
working for a dude named Ronan.

17:16.030 --> 17:17.960
Ronan? I'm sorry, Mr. Quill.

17:18.060 --> 17:19.069
I truly am.

17:19.170 --> 17:23.329
But I want no part of this
transaction if Ronan is involved.

17:23.869 --> 17:25.069
Who's Ronan?

17:25.170 --> 17:28.410
A Kree fanatic,
outraged by the peace treaty,

17:28.510 --> 17:32.850
who will not rest until
Xandarian culture, my culture,

17:32.950 --> 17:34.660
- is wiped from existence!
- Come on.

17:34.760 --> 17:37.120
He's someone whose bad
side I'd rather not be on.

17:37.220 --> 17:40.750
- What? What about my bad side?
- Farewell, Mr. Quill.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.460
Hey, we had a deal, bro!

17:50.060 --> 17:51.590
What happened?

17:53.370 --> 17:57.000
This guy just backed out of a deal on me.
If there's one thing I hate,

17:57.100 --> 18:00.830
it's a man without integrity.
Peter Quill. People call me Star-Lord.

18:01.910 --> 18:04.180
You have the bearing of a man of honor.

18:04.280 --> 18:06.840
Well, you know, I wouldn't say that.

18:07.210 --> 18:09.650
People say it about me, all the time,

18:09.750 --> 18:12.420
but it's not something I
would ever say about myself.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.130
This wasn't the plan.

18:34.210 --> 18:36.410
Put him in the bag. Put him in the bag!

18:36.510 --> 18:38.810
No! Not her, him!

18:38.910 --> 18:40.810
Learn genders, man.

18:42.180 --> 18:44.340
Biting? That's not fair!

18:47.320 --> 18:49.480
Take it easy!

19:17.750 --> 19:19.450
Fool. You should have learned.

19:19.550 --> 19:21.820
I don't learn. One of my issues.

19:30.060 --> 19:32.160
What the...

19:34.970 --> 19:38.530
Quit smiling, you idiot.
You're supposed to be a professional.

19:39.310 --> 19:41.170
You gotta be kidding me.

19:41.270 --> 19:43.140
Hey!

20:00.330 --> 20:02.830
I live for the simple things.

20:02.930 --> 20:05.590
Like how much this is gonna hurt.

20:10.070 --> 20:12.540
Yeah. Writhe, little man.

20:14.240 --> 20:15.680
It'll grow back, you d'ast idiot.

20:15.780 --> 20:17.740
Quit whining.

20:25.650 --> 20:29.350
Subject 89P13, drop your weapon.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.060
Crap.

20:31.160 --> 20:32.590
By the authority of the Nova Corps,

20:32.690 --> 20:34.490
- you are under arrest...
- All right. Come on up.

20:34.590 --> 20:36.760
...for endangerment to life and
the destruction of property.

20:36.860 --> 20:40.030
Hey! If it isn't Star-Prince.

20:40.130 --> 20:43.400
- Star-Lord.
- Sorry. "Lord."

20:43.500 --> 20:47.110
I picked this guy up a while back for
petty theft. He's got a code name.

20:47.210 --> 20:48.250
Yeah. Stay out of the way.

20:48.340 --> 20:50.210
Come on, man. It's a...
It's an outlaw name.

20:50.310 --> 20:52.010
Just relax, pal.

20:52.110 --> 20:54.670
It's cool to have a code name.
It's not that weird.

20:55.780 --> 20:57.770
Fascists.

21:10.460 --> 21:14.230
Ronan is destroying Xandarian
outposts throughout the galaxy.

21:14.330 --> 21:18.200
I should think that would call for some
slight response on the part of the Kree.

21:18.310 --> 21:21.170
We signed your peace treaty, Nova Prime.
What more do you want?

21:21.270 --> 21:25.610
At least a statement from the Kree Empire
saying that they condemn his actions.

21:25.710 --> 21:29.720
He is slaughtering children.
Families.

21:29.820 --> 21:34.680
That is your business. Now,
I have other matters to attend to.

21:35.660 --> 21:37.120
Prick.

21:38.930 --> 21:40.360
Well, some good news.

21:40.460 --> 21:43.900
It looks like we've apprehended
one of Ronan's compatriots.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.270
Gamora. Surgically modified and
trained as a living weapon.

21:48.370 --> 21:51.200
The adopted daughter of
the Mad Titan, Thanos.

21:51.300 --> 21:54.470
Recently, Thanos lent her and
her sister Nebula out to Ronan,

21:54.570 --> 21:57.840
which leads us to believe that Thanos
and Ronan are working together.

21:57.940 --> 22:02.320
Subject 89P13. Calls itself "Rocket."

22:02.420 --> 22:03.780
The result of illegal genetic

22:03.880 --> 22:06.990
and cybernetic experiments
on a lower life form.

22:07.090 --> 22:09.160
What the hell?

22:09.260 --> 22:10.820
They call it "Groot."

22:10.920 --> 22:13.390
A humanoid plant that's
been traveling recently

22:13.490 --> 22:17.120
as 89P13's personal
houseplant / muscle.

22:18.160 --> 22:20.970
Peter Jason Quill, from Terra.

22:21.070 --> 22:24.140
Raised from youth by a band of
mercenaries called the Ravagers,

22:24.240 --> 22:26.070
led by Yondu Udonta.

22:26.170 --> 22:27.670
I'm sorry.

22:27.770 --> 22:30.740
I didn't know how this machine worked.

22:30.840 --> 22:33.350
What a bunch of a-holes.

22:33.450 --> 22:36.380
Transport all four to the Kyln.

22:38.780 --> 22:42.190
I guess most of Nova Corps
wanna uphold the laws,

22:42.290 --> 22:45.860
but these ones here,
they're corrupt and cruel.

22:45.960 --> 22:49.830
But, hey, that's not my problem.
I ain't gonna be here long.

22:49.930 --> 22:53.400
I've escaped 22 prisons.
This one's no different.

22:53.500 --> 22:56.070
You're lucky the broad showed up,
because otherwise, me and Groot

22:56.170 --> 22:58.000
would be collecting
that bounty right now,

22:58.100 --> 23:01.140
and you'd be getting drawn and
quartered by Yondu and those Ravagers.

23:01.240 --> 23:03.380
I've had a lot of folks try
to kill me over the years.

23:03.480 --> 23:06.280
I ain't about to be brought down
by a tree and a talking raccoon.

23:06.380 --> 23:07.450
Hold.

23:07.550 --> 23:09.450
- What's a raccoon?
- "What's a raccoon?"

23:09.550 --> 23:10.850
It's what you are, stupid.

23:10.950 --> 23:13.990
Ain't no thing like me, except me.

23:14.090 --> 23:16.660
So, this Orb has a real
shiny blue suitcase,

23:16.760 --> 23:20.250
Ark of the Covenant,
Maltese Falcon sort of vibe.

23:20.390 --> 23:21.790
- What is it?
- I am Groot.

23:21.890 --> 23:23.560
So what? What's the Orb?

23:23.660 --> 23:25.870
I have no words for an honorless thief.

23:25.970 --> 23:29.470
Pretty high and mighty coming from
the lackey of a genocidal maniac.

23:29.570 --> 23:31.440
Yeah, I know who you are.

23:31.540 --> 23:35.210
- Anyone who's anyone knows who you are.
- Yeah, we know who you are.

23:35.310 --> 23:37.810
- Who is she?
- I am Groot.

23:37.910 --> 23:40.310
Yeah, you said that.

23:40.580 --> 23:44.920
I wasn't retrieving the Orb
for Ronan. I was betraying him.

23:45.020 --> 23:47.490
I had an agreement to
sell it to a third party.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.390
I am Groot.

23:50.490 --> 23:54.730
Well, that's just as fascinating as
the first 89 times you told me that.

23:54.830 --> 23:57.000
What is wrong with Giving Tree, here?

23:57.100 --> 23:59.300
Well, he don't know talking
good like me and you.

23:59.400 --> 24:03.470
So his vocabulistics is limited
to "I" and "am" and "Groot."

24:03.570 --> 24:05.270
Exclusively in that order.

24:05.370 --> 24:08.070
I tell you what, that's gonna
wear real thin, real fast.

24:08.980 --> 24:11.870
Hey. Put that away.

24:12.550 --> 24:13.810
Hey!

24:13.910 --> 24:16.250
Listen to me, you big blue bastard.
Take those headphones off.

24:16.350 --> 24:20.450
That's mine. Those belong to impound.
That tape and that player is mine!

24:23.590 --> 24:28.560
Hooked on a Feeling, Blue Swede, 1973.
That song belongs to me!

25:47.870 --> 25:51.140
- You first! You first!
- Murderer!

25:51.240 --> 25:53.780
Coming for you first, Gamora!
You're dead!

25:53.880 --> 25:58.580
You're scum! You're scum!

26:01.090 --> 26:02.290
It's like I said,

26:02.390 --> 26:04.220
she's got a rep.

26:04.320 --> 26:06.290
A lot of prisoners here
have lost their families

26:06.390 --> 26:08.460
to Ronan and his goons.

26:08.560 --> 26:09.830
She'll last a day, tops.

26:09.930 --> 26:11.500
Murderer!

26:11.600 --> 26:13.130
The guards will protect her, right?

26:13.230 --> 26:15.500
They're here to stop us from getting out.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.570
They don't care what we
do to each other inside.

26:17.670 --> 26:21.210
Whatever nightmares the future holds,

26:21.310 --> 26:25.400
are dreams compared
to what's behind me.

26:26.010 --> 26:28.880
Check out the new meat.

26:28.980 --> 26:32.720
I'm gonna slather you
up in Gunavian jelly,

26:32.820 --> 26:34.580
and go to town...

26:38.760 --> 26:40.990
Let's make something clear.

26:41.690 --> 26:45.220
This one here is our booty!

26:45.430 --> 26:47.730
You wanna get to him,

26:47.870 --> 26:50.060
you go through us!

26:50.400 --> 26:53.110
Or, more accurately,

26:53.210 --> 26:56.110
we go through you.

27:05.650 --> 27:07.910
I'm with them.

27:09.020 --> 27:11.110
I hate you.

27:11.460 --> 27:14.450
No cell's gonna protect you for long.

27:26.670 --> 27:28.200
You're dead!

27:28.310 --> 27:29.770
Dead!

27:55.570 --> 27:57.340
Take her down to the showers.

27:57.440 --> 28:00.730
It'll be easier to clean
up the blood down there.

28:12.950 --> 28:14.710
Quill, where you going?

28:15.590 --> 28:17.080
Quill.

28:17.520 --> 28:18.990
Quill!

28:19.530 --> 28:23.030
Gamora, consider this a death sentence

28:23.130 --> 28:25.260
for your crimes against the galaxy.

28:25.360 --> 28:27.020
You dare?

28:32.740 --> 28:35.070
You know who I am, yes?

28:35.370 --> 28:36.680
You're Drax.

28:36.780 --> 28:38.910
The Destroyer.

28:39.010 --> 28:40.010
Quill!

28:40.110 --> 28:42.080
And you know why they call me this.

28:42.180 --> 28:45.210
You slayed dozens of Ronan's minions.

28:45.420 --> 28:48.690
Ronan murdered my wife, Ovette,

28:48.790 --> 28:51.220
and my daughter, Camaria.

28:51.560 --> 28:53.790
He slaughtered them where they stood.

28:54.330 --> 28:56.060
And he laughed!

28:56.160 --> 28:57.130
Quill?

28:57.230 --> 28:58.790
Her life

28:59.130 --> 29:01.570
is not yours to take.

29:02.570 --> 29:05.560
He killed my family.

29:05.800 --> 29:07.430
I shall kill one of his in return.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.900
Of course, Drax. Here, I...

29:17.320 --> 29:19.150
Quill! What are you doing?

29:19.250 --> 29:22.950
I'm no family to Ronan or Thanos.

29:32.100 --> 29:34.260
I'm your only hope at stopping him.

29:35.800 --> 29:38.500
Woman, your words mean nothing to me!

29:38.600 --> 29:41.140
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
- Crap.

29:41.240 --> 29:43.410
You know, if killing Ronan
is truly your sole purpose,

29:43.510 --> 29:45.470
I don't think this is the
best way to go about it.

29:45.510 --> 29:48.650
Are you not the man this
wench attempted to kill?

29:48.750 --> 29:51.120
Well, I mean, she's hardly the first
woman to try and do that to me.

29:51.220 --> 29:54.790
Look, this is from a
smoking-hot Rajak girl.

29:54.890 --> 29:58.120
Stabbed me with a fork. Didn't like
me skipping out on her at sunrise.

29:58.220 --> 30:00.790
I got, right here, a Kree girl
tried to rip out my thorax.

30:00.890 --> 30:04.060
She caught me with this skinny little
A'askavariian who worked in Nova Records.

30:04.160 --> 30:07.570
I was trying to get information.
You ever see an A'askavariian?

30:07.670 --> 30:09.540
They have tentacles,
and needles for teeth.

30:09.640 --> 30:12.330
If you think I'm seriously
interested in that, then...

30:12.840 --> 30:15.860
You don't care. But here's the point.

30:17.110 --> 30:20.410
She betrayed Ronan.
He's coming back for her.

30:20.610 --> 30:22.210
And when he does,

30:22.350 --> 30:24.650
that's when you...

30:25.180 --> 30:28.150
Why would I put my
finger on his throat?

30:28.250 --> 30:29.780
What?

30:31.520 --> 30:32.590
No, it's a symbol.

30:32.690 --> 30:37.360
This is a symbol for
you slicing his throat.

30:37.460 --> 30:39.430
I would not slice his throat.

30:39.530 --> 30:42.300
I would cut his head clean off.

30:42.400 --> 30:44.500
It's a general expression
for you killing somebody.

30:44.600 --> 30:46.140
You've heard of this.
You've seen this, right?

30:46.240 --> 30:47.720
- You know what that is.
- Yeah. Yeah.

30:47.770 --> 30:49.900
- Everyone knows.
- No, no.

30:51.540 --> 30:55.010
What I'm saying is,
you want to keep her alive.

30:55.250 --> 30:58.080
Don't do his work for him.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.460
I like your knife. I'm keeping it.

31:14.130 --> 31:16.300
- That was my favorite knife.
- Listen!

31:16.400 --> 31:19.540
I could care less whether
you live or whether you die.

31:19.640 --> 31:22.800
- Then why stop the big guy?
- Simple.

31:22.910 --> 31:24.210
You know where to sell my Orb.

31:24.310 --> 31:27.000
How are we gonna sell it
when we and it are still here?

31:27.780 --> 31:29.300
My friend Rocket, here,

31:29.420 --> 31:31.180
has escaped 22 prisons.

31:31.350 --> 31:32.520
We're getting out.

31:32.620 --> 31:35.590
And then we're headed straight
to Yondu to retrieve your bounty.

31:35.690 --> 31:39.780
How much was your buyer
willing to pay you for my Orb?

31:40.690 --> 31:41.960
Four billion units.

31:42.060 --> 31:43.900
- What?
- Holy shit.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.020
That Orb is my opportunity to
get away from Thanos and Ronan.

31:48.330 --> 31:49.960
If you free us,

31:51.470 --> 31:54.740
I'll lead you to the buyer directly and I'll
split the profit between the three of us.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.910
I am Groot.

31:57.010 --> 31:58.080
Four of us.

31:58.180 --> 32:01.750
Asleep for the danger, awake for
the money, as per frickin' usual.

32:03.120 --> 32:06.120
You have been betrayed, Ronan.

32:06.220 --> 32:08.350
We know only that
she has been captured.

32:08.890 --> 32:10.960
Gamora may yet recover the Orb.

32:11.060 --> 32:15.490
No! Our sources within the Kyln say
Gamora has her own plans for the Orb.

32:15.590 --> 32:18.200
Look, your partnership with Thanos

32:18.300 --> 32:20.490
is at risk.

32:20.970 --> 32:24.990
Thanos requires your presence. Now!

32:30.340 --> 32:34.150
With all due respect, Thanos,
your daughter made this mess,

32:34.250 --> 32:35.750
and yet you summon me.

32:35.850 --> 32:37.750
I would lower my voice, Accuser.

32:37.850 --> 32:39.920
First, she lost a battle
with some primitive.

32:40.020 --> 32:41.890
Thanos put Gamora under your charge.

32:41.990 --> 32:44.760
Then she was apprehended
by the Nova Corps.

32:44.860 --> 32:46.660
You are the one here with
nothing to show for it.

32:46.760 --> 32:50.860
Your sources say that she meant
to betray us the whole time!

32:50.960 --> 32:52.300
Lower your tone!

32:52.400 --> 32:53.860
I may be your...

33:01.610 --> 33:05.980
I only ask that you take
this matter seriously.

33:06.650 --> 33:10.650
The only matter I do not
take seriously, boy,

33:10.750 --> 33:12.480
is you.

33:12.750 --> 33:15.320
Your politics bore me.

33:15.420 --> 33:18.490
Your demeanor is that of a pouty child.

33:18.590 --> 33:23.750
And, apparently, you alienated
my favorite daughter, Gamora.

33:25.800 --> 33:28.830
I shall honor our agreement, Kree,

33:28.930 --> 33:31.200
if you bring me the Orb.

33:31.640 --> 33:34.630
But return to me again empty-handed,

33:34.740 --> 33:38.110
and I will bathe the
starways in your blood.

33:40.980 --> 33:43.340
Thanks, Dad. Sounds fair.

33:45.180 --> 33:48.380
This is one fight you won't win.

33:49.120 --> 33:51.280
Let's head to the Kyln.

33:59.360 --> 34:02.470
If we're gonna get out of here, we're
gonna need to get into that watchtower.

34:02.570 --> 34:04.700
And to do that,
I'm gonna need a few things.

34:05.170 --> 34:09.780
The guards wear security bands to
control their ins and outs. I need one.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.310
Leave it to me.

34:11.409 --> 34:14.210
That dude, there.
I need his prosthetic leg.

34:14.310 --> 34:16.050
- His leg?
- Yeah.

34:16.150 --> 34:18.650
God knows I don't need the rest of him.
Look at him, he's useless.

34:18.750 --> 34:19.750
All right.

34:19.850 --> 34:24.159
And finally, on the wall back there
is a black panel. Blinky yellow light.

34:24.260 --> 34:26.230
- Do you see it?
- Yeah.

34:26.330 --> 34:30.460
There's a quarnyx battery behind it.
Purplish box, green wires.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.699
To get into that watchtower,
I definitely need it.

34:32.800 --> 34:34.199
How are we supposed to do that?

34:34.300 --> 34:36.570
Well, supposably,
these bald-bodies find you attractive.

34:36.670 --> 34:38.300
So, maybe you can work
out some sort of trade.

34:38.400 --> 34:39.540
You must be joking.

34:39.639 --> 34:41.409
No, I really heard they
find you attractive.

34:41.510 --> 34:43.110
Look, it's 20 feet up in the air,

34:43.210 --> 34:45.610
and it's in the middle of the most
heavily-guarded part of the prison.

34:45.710 --> 34:48.480
It's impossible to get up
there without being seen.

34:48.580 --> 34:51.780
I got one plan, and that plan
requires a frickin' quarnyx battery,

34:51.880 --> 34:53.480
so figure it out!

34:54.389 --> 34:56.320
Can I get back to it? Thanks.

34:56.420 --> 34:59.990
Now, this is important.
Once the battery is removed,

35:00.090 --> 35:02.460
everything is gonna slam
into emergency mode.

35:02.560 --> 35:08.700
Once we have it, we gotta move quickly,
so you definitely need to get that last.

35:13.940 --> 35:16.070
Or we could just get
it first and improvise.

35:16.170 --> 35:18.700
- I'll get the armband.
- Leg.

35:30.360 --> 35:34.390
Prisoner, drop the device immediately
and retreat to your cell,

35:34.490 --> 35:36.820
or we will open fire.

35:42.400 --> 35:44.540
I am

35:44.640 --> 35:47.410
Groot!

35:47.510 --> 35:49.340
Fire!

36:01.450 --> 36:04.250
All prisoners return to
your sleeping areas.

36:09.460 --> 36:10.800
You idiot!

36:10.900 --> 36:14.090
How am I supposed to fight
these things without my stuff?

36:19.870 --> 36:21.510
The animal is in control.

36:21.610 --> 36:24.040
Fire on my command!

36:43.000 --> 36:44.860
Creepy little beast!

36:50.940 --> 36:54.460
Oh, yeah.

37:05.980 --> 37:08.250
You need my what?

37:23.940 --> 37:25.540
- I'll need this.
- Good luck.

37:25.640 --> 37:27.070
It's internally wired.

37:27.170 --> 37:29.260
I'll figure something out.

37:32.340 --> 37:33.910
Drop the leg!

37:34.010 --> 37:37.070
Drop the leg and move
back to your cell!

37:51.530 --> 37:53.330
Rocket!

37:55.670 --> 37:58.500
Move to the watchtower!

38:29.030 --> 38:30.520
You!

38:31.070 --> 38:33.130
Man who has lain with an A'askavariian!

38:34.070 --> 38:36.630
It was one time, man.

38:37.980 --> 38:40.970
We need all available guards
in full combat gear...

39:02.900 --> 39:04.830
Spare me your foul gaze, woman.

39:05.500 --> 39:06.990
Why is this one here?

39:07.110 --> 39:09.640
We promised him he could stay by
your side until he kills your boss.

39:09.740 --> 39:12.680
I always keep my promises,
when they're to muscle-bound whack-jobs

39:12.780 --> 39:14.510
who will kill me if I don't. Here you go.

39:14.850 --> 39:17.650
I was just kidding about the leg.
I just need these two things.

39:17.750 --> 39:19.450
- What?
- No, I thought it'd be funny.

39:19.550 --> 39:22.450
Was it funny? Wait, what did
he look like hopping around?

39:22.550 --> 39:24.950
I had to transfer him 30,000 units!

39:27.390 --> 39:28.950
How are we going to leave?

39:30.600 --> 39:33.930
Well, he's got a plan. Right?
Or is that another thing you made up?

39:34.030 --> 39:35.630
I have a plan! I have a plan!

39:35.730 --> 39:39.070
Cease your yammering and relieve
us from this irksome confinement.

39:39.170 --> 39:42.440
Yeah, I'll have to agree with the
walking thesaurus on that one.

39:42.540 --> 39:45.480
Do not ever call me a thesaurus.

39:45.810 --> 39:46.910
It's just a metaphor, dude.

39:47.010 --> 39:49.880
His people are completely literal.
Metaphors are gonna go over his head.

39:49.980 --> 39:51.680
Nothing goes over my head.

39:51.780 --> 39:55.340
My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.

39:55.550 --> 39:59.820
I'm gonna die surrounded by
the biggest idiots in the galaxy.

40:05.600 --> 40:07.360
Those are some big guns.

40:08.200 --> 40:09.830
On my command!

40:10.300 --> 40:11.770
Number one!

40:13.270 --> 40:16.130
- Rodent, we are ready for your plan.
- Hold on!

40:17.240 --> 40:19.470
Number two!

40:19.910 --> 40:24.020
I recognize this animal. We'd roast
them over a flame pit as children.

40:24.120 --> 40:26.720
- Their flesh was quite delicious.
- Not helping!

40:26.820 --> 40:28.290
Number three!

40:33.990 --> 40:37.030
All fire on my command!

40:37.130 --> 40:38.600
Three!

40:38.700 --> 40:40.230
Two!

40:40.330 --> 40:41.960
One!

40:55.850 --> 40:57.720
He turned off the artificial gravity,

40:57.820 --> 41:00.250
everywhere but in here.

41:38.490 --> 41:40.860
I told you I had a plan.

42:03.080 --> 42:04.810
That was a pretty good plan.

42:15.690 --> 42:17.200
Yeah! There it is. Get my ship.

42:17.300 --> 42:19.970
It's the Milano, the orange and
blue one over in the corner.

42:20.070 --> 42:21.870
They crumpled my pants up into a ball.

42:21.970 --> 42:24.430
That's rude! They folded yours.

42:32.280 --> 42:34.280
The Orb's there. Let's go.

42:34.380 --> 42:36.950
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

42:37.050 --> 42:39.120
That bastard didn't put it back.

42:39.220 --> 42:41.820
- Put what back?
- Here.

42:41.920 --> 42:43.640
Get them to the ship. I will be right back.

42:43.720 --> 42:46.290
- How are you gonna possibly...
- Just keep the Milano close by.

42:46.390 --> 42:47.730
Go.

42:47.830 --> 42:49.550
Go!

43:09.350 --> 43:11.710
My neck!

43:15.920 --> 43:17.560
Well, how's he gonna get to us?

43:17.660 --> 43:19.590
He declined to share that
information with me.

43:19.690 --> 43:21.160
Well, screw this, then!

43:21.490 --> 43:25.060
I ain't waiting around for some humie with
a death wish. You got the Orb, right?

43:25.160 --> 43:27.220
Yes.

43:49.390 --> 43:52.090
If we don't leave now,
we will be blown to bits.

43:52.190 --> 43:53.160
No!

43:53.260 --> 43:55.730
We're not leaving without the Orb.

44:03.900 --> 44:05.660
Behold.

44:12.710 --> 44:14.810
This one shows spirit.

44:14.910 --> 44:17.850
He shall make a keen ally in
the battle against Ronan.

44:17.950 --> 44:20.880
Companion, what were you retrieving?

44:26.590 --> 44:28.580
You're an imbecile.

44:38.770 --> 44:40.270
Yo, Ranger Rick! What are you doing?

44:40.370 --> 44:42.970
You can't take apart my
ship without asking me!

44:43.070 --> 44:44.910
- See, what is this?
- Don't touch that!

44:45.010 --> 44:45.980
It's a bomb.

44:46.080 --> 44:47.150
- A bomb?
- Yup.

44:47.250 --> 44:48.950
And you leave it lying around?

44:49.050 --> 44:50.650
I was gonna put it in a box.

44:50.750 --> 44:51.850
What's a box gonna do?

44:51.950 --> 44:54.150
- How about this one?
- No! Hey!

44:54.250 --> 44:55.250
- Leave it alone.
- Why? What is it?

44:55.350 --> 44:57.320
- Shut up.
- Hey!

44:58.120 --> 44:59.220
What is that?

44:59.320 --> 45:02.430
That's for if things get really hardcore.

45:02.530 --> 45:03.760
Or if you wanna blow up moons.

45:03.860 --> 45:05.400
No one's blowing up moons.

45:05.500 --> 45:07.670
You just wanna suck the
joy out of everything.

45:07.770 --> 45:10.290
So, listen, I'm gonna need
your buyer's coordinates.

45:10.400 --> 45:13.170
We're heading in the
right direction. For now.

45:13.270 --> 45:15.810
If we're gonna work together,
you might try trusting me a little bit.

45:15.910 --> 45:17.410
And how much do you trust me?

45:17.510 --> 45:20.940
I'd trust you a lot more if
you told me what this was.

45:21.410 --> 45:24.380
Because I'm guessing it's
some kind of weapon.

45:24.480 --> 45:25.780
I don't know what it is.

45:25.880 --> 45:28.220
If it's a weapon, we should
use it against Ronan.

45:28.320 --> 45:30.260
Put it down, you fool.
You'll destroy us all.

45:30.360 --> 45:31.420
Or just you, murderess!

45:31.520 --> 45:33.190
I let you live once, princess!

45:33.290 --> 45:35.390
- I am not a princess!
- Hey!

45:35.490 --> 45:39.520
Nobody is killing anybody on my ship!

45:39.800 --> 45:43.370
We're stuck together
until we get the money.

45:43.470 --> 45:45.670
I have no interest in money.

45:45.770 --> 45:47.460
Great.

45:48.310 --> 45:51.870
That means more money
for the three of us.

45:54.080 --> 45:57.250
For the four of us. Partners.

45:57.350 --> 46:01.040
We have an agreement, but I would
never be partners with the likes of you.

46:01.450 --> 46:03.610
I'll tell the buyer we're on our way.

46:04.260 --> 46:07.950
And Quill, your ship is filthy.

46:12.130 --> 46:14.120
She has no idea.

46:14.270 --> 46:16.230
If I had a black light,

46:16.330 --> 46:19.300
the place would look like a
Jackson Pollock painting.

46:19.470 --> 46:21.630
You got issues, Quill.

46:28.950 --> 46:32.970
I swear. I don't know where
they went! I swear.

46:33.550 --> 46:35.950
If he knew where they were headed,
he would have already told us.

46:36.050 --> 46:37.490
Yeah.

46:37.590 --> 46:41.830
Ronan, the Nova Corps sent a
fleet to defend the prison.

46:41.930 --> 46:46.360
Well, then, send Necrocraft to
every corner of the quadrant.

46:46.460 --> 46:49.930
Find the Orb. Any means, any price.

46:50.030 --> 46:53.540
- And this place?
- The Nova can't know what we're after.

46:54.570 --> 46:56.940
Cleanse it!

46:59.340 --> 47:01.780
Do you got any other cute
little buggers like this one?

47:01.880 --> 47:05.880
I like to stick 'em all in a
row on my control console.

47:05.980 --> 47:08.090
I can't tell if you're joking or not.

47:08.190 --> 47:10.320
He's being fully serious.

47:10.420 --> 47:13.120
In that case, I can show you...

47:13.220 --> 47:15.590
But first, you gonna tell
me what this Orb is,

47:15.690 --> 47:18.350
and why everybody cares
so damn much about it.

47:18.500 --> 47:20.300
And then you gonna tell me,

47:20.400 --> 47:22.530
who out there might wanna buy it.

47:22.630 --> 47:25.800
Sir, the high-end community is a...

47:28.240 --> 47:30.140
The high-end community is a...

47:30.410 --> 47:31.880
It's a tight-knit...

47:31.980 --> 47:33.240
Tight-knit...

47:33.340 --> 47:35.540
The high-end community
is a very tight-knit...

47:36.310 --> 47:38.150
I cannot possibly betray

47:38.250 --> 47:40.410
the confidentiality of my buyers!

47:51.130 --> 47:53.960
Now, who again is this buyer of yours?

47:57.140 --> 47:58.540
Carina.

47:58.640 --> 47:59.770
Yes, Master.

47:59.870 --> 48:03.310
Your people do have elbows,
do they not?

48:03.410 --> 48:04.840
We do, Master.

48:04.940 --> 48:08.380
Then use them.

48:09.210 --> 48:10.620
I don't have to remind you

48:10.720 --> 48:14.190
what happened to the last
attendant who disappointed me.

48:14.290 --> 48:16.180
Do I?

48:18.290 --> 48:23.020
Chop, chop. Our guests
will be here soon.

48:26.330 --> 48:29.390
Heads up! We're inbound.

48:48.320 --> 48:49.810
What is it?

48:50.390 --> 48:52.360
It's called Knowhere.

48:52.460 --> 48:55.730
The severed head of an
ancient celestial being.

48:55.830 --> 48:58.090
Be wary headed in, rodent.

48:58.800 --> 49:02.420
There are no regulations
whatsoever here.

49:26.320 --> 49:29.160
Hundreds of years ago,
the Tivan Group sent workers in

49:29.260 --> 49:31.830
to mine the organic
matter within the skull.

49:31.930 --> 49:34.230
Bone, brain tissue, spinal fluid.

49:34.330 --> 49:39.440
All rare resources, highly valued
in black markets across the galaxy.

49:39.540 --> 49:43.170
It's dangerous and illegal work,
suitable only for outlaws.

49:43.270 --> 49:45.470
Well, I come from a planet of outlaws.

49:45.580 --> 49:48.950
Billy the Kid, Bonnie
and Clyde, John Stamos.

49:49.050 --> 49:50.550
It sounds like a place,
which I would like to visit.

49:50.650 --> 49:52.140
Yeah, you should.

49:53.120 --> 49:54.150
Excuse me.

49:54.250 --> 49:57.080
- Watch your wallets.
- Can you spare any units?

50:04.060 --> 50:06.150
Get out of here.

50:10.870 --> 50:13.270
Your buyer's in there?

50:13.370 --> 50:15.270
We are to wait here
for his representative.

50:15.370 --> 50:16.870
Get out of here!

50:16.970 --> 50:19.210
This is no respectable establishment.

50:19.310 --> 50:21.840
What do you expect
us to do while we wait?

50:23.150 --> 50:24.740
Yes! Yes!

50:33.290 --> 50:35.190
Yahoo!

50:41.700 --> 50:43.530
My Orloni has won,

50:43.630 --> 50:45.900
as I won at all things!

50:46.100 --> 50:48.840
Now, let's put more of
this liquid into our bodies.

50:48.940 --> 50:53.310
That's the first thing you said
that wasn't bat-shit crazy!

50:54.450 --> 50:56.310
Man, you wouldn't believe what
they charge for fuel out here.

50:56.410 --> 51:00.850
- I might actually lose money on this job.
- My connection is making us wait.

51:00.950 --> 51:04.990
It's just a negotiation tactic.
Trust me, this is my specialty.

51:05.090 --> 51:10.420
Where yours is more,
"Stab, stab. Those are my terms."

51:11.200 --> 51:14.350
- My father didn't stress diplomacy.
- Thanos?

51:15.670 --> 51:17.460
He's not my father.

51:18.300 --> 51:22.530
When Thanos took my home world,
he killed my parents in front of me.

51:23.070 --> 51:27.480
He tortured me,
turned me into a weapon.

51:27.580 --> 51:31.620
When he said he was going to destroy
an entire planet for Ronan,

51:31.720 --> 51:34.150
I couldn't stand by and...

51:38.590 --> 51:41.020
Why would you risk your life for this?

51:42.660 --> 51:44.680
My mother gave it to me.

51:46.260 --> 51:49.000
My mom liked sharing with me all the
pop songs that she loved growing up.

51:49.100 --> 51:50.470
I happened to have it on me,

51:50.570 --> 51:52.900
when I was...

51:53.170 --> 51:55.470
The day that she...

51:57.410 --> 51:59.640
You know, when I left Earth.

52:00.080 --> 52:01.380
What do you do with it?

52:01.480 --> 52:05.220
Do? Nothing. You listen to it.
Or you can dance.

52:05.320 --> 52:09.990
I'm a warrior and an assassin.
I do not dance.

52:10.090 --> 52:11.360
Really?

52:11.460 --> 52:15.660
On my planet, there's a
legend about people like you.

52:15.760 --> 52:17.300
It's called

52:17.400 --> 52:18.700
Footloose.

52:18.800 --> 52:22.870
And in it, a great hero

52:22.970 --> 52:24.700
named Kevin Bacon,

52:25.140 --> 52:30.300
teaches an entire city full of people with
sticks up their butts that dancing, well...

52:31.040 --> 52:33.410
It's the greatest thing there is.

52:33.810 --> 52:35.450
Who put the sticks up their butts?

52:35.550 --> 52:37.010
What? No, that's just a...

52:37.110 --> 52:38.980
- That is cruel.
- It's just a phrase

52:39.080 --> 52:41.740
people use.

52:59.800 --> 53:02.470
The melody is pleasant!

53:19.090 --> 53:21.330
- No!
- What the hell?

53:21.430 --> 53:22.830
I know who you are, Peter Quill!

53:22.930 --> 53:26.230
And I am not some starry-eyed
waif here to succumb to your...

53:26.330 --> 53:28.530
Your pelvic sorcery!

53:28.630 --> 53:30.500
That is not what is happening here.

53:35.110 --> 53:37.440
No.

53:46.220 --> 53:47.850
Stop it!

53:47.950 --> 53:49.290
What are you doing?

53:49.390 --> 53:52.520
This vermin speaks of affairs
he knows nothing about!

53:52.620 --> 53:54.590
- That is true!
- He has no respect!

53:54.690 --> 53:57.090
- That is also true!
- Hold on! Hold on!

53:57.190 --> 53:59.360
Keep calling me vermin, tough guy!

53:59.460 --> 54:01.530
You just wanna laugh at
me like everyone else!

54:01.630 --> 54:04.240
Rocket, you're drunk. All right?
No one's laughing at you.

54:04.340 --> 54:07.100
He thinks I'm some
stupid thing! He does!

54:07.200 --> 54:09.610
Well, I didn't ask to get made!

54:09.710 --> 54:11.780
I didn't ask to be torn apart,

54:11.880 --> 54:13.880
and put back together, over and over

54:13.980 --> 54:16.250
and turned into some...

54:16.350 --> 54:17.420
Some little monster!

54:17.520 --> 54:19.480
Rocket, no one's calling you a monster.

54:19.580 --> 54:21.750
He called me "vermin"!

54:21.850 --> 54:24.520
She called me "rodent"!

54:24.620 --> 54:25.960
Let's see if you can laugh

54:26.060 --> 54:29.190
after five or six good shots
to your frickin' face!

54:29.290 --> 54:33.100
No, no, no, no!
Four billion units! Rocket!

54:33.200 --> 54:37.490
Come on, man. Hey! Suck it up for one
more lousy night and you're rich.

54:45.680 --> 54:48.030
Fine. But I can't promise,

54:48.130 --> 54:50.680
when all this is over I'm not gonna
kill every last one of you jerks.

54:50.780 --> 54:54.740
See? That's exactly why none
of you have any friends!

54:54.890 --> 54:57.520
Five seconds after you meet somebody,
you're already trying to kill them!

54:57.620 --> 55:01.630
We have traveled,
halfway across the quadrant.

55:01.730 --> 55:04.190
And Ronan is no closer to being dead.

55:06.130 --> 55:08.230
- Drax!
- Let him go.

55:08.330 --> 55:09.990
We don't need him.

55:12.100 --> 55:14.040
Milady Gamora.

55:14.140 --> 55:16.400
I'm here to fetch you for my master.

55:22.250 --> 55:24.550
Okay, this isn't creepy at all.

55:24.650 --> 55:27.950
We house the galaxy's
largest collection

55:28.190 --> 55:31.090
of fauna, relics,
and species of all manner.

55:37.290 --> 55:38.900
I present to you,

55:39.000 --> 55:43.090
Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.

55:56.450 --> 55:59.040
Oh, my dear Gamora.

55:59.380 --> 56:01.890
How wonderful to meet in the flesh.

56:01.990 --> 56:04.890
Let's bypass the formalities, Tivan.

56:04.990 --> 56:07.920
We have what we discussed.

56:08.330 --> 56:13.030
What is that thing there?

56:13.130 --> 56:15.290
I am Groot.

56:18.940 --> 56:20.640
I never thought I'd meet a Groot.

56:20.740 --> 56:22.640
Sir...

56:22.910 --> 56:26.210
You must allow me to pay you now
so that I may own your carcass.

56:26.310 --> 56:29.250
At the moment of your death, of course.

56:29.350 --> 56:30.650
I am Groot.

56:30.750 --> 56:33.520
Why, so he could turn
you into a frickin' chair?

56:33.620 --> 56:35.080
That's your pet?

56:35.950 --> 56:38.050
- His what?
- Tivan.

56:38.190 --> 56:42.030
We have been halfway around
the galaxy, retrieving this Orb.

56:42.130 --> 56:44.230
Very well, then.

56:44.330 --> 56:47.300
Let us see what you brought.

57:00.500 --> 57:03.310
Three quarnyx batteries,
seven cases of Cotati seeds.

57:03.410 --> 57:07.200
No, cases. Last time, you sent me...

57:08.340 --> 57:11.580
You shall send a message for me.

57:11.680 --> 57:13.610
Oh, my new friends.

57:14.480 --> 57:17.690
Before creation itself,

57:17.790 --> 57:19.950
there were six singularities.

57:21.760 --> 57:25.530
Then the universe
exploded into existence,

57:25.630 --> 57:27.730
and the remnants of these systems

57:27.830 --> 57:31.730
were forged into concentrated ingots.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.760
Infinity Stones.

57:35.470 --> 57:37.010
These stones, it seems,

57:37.110 --> 57:38.970
can only be brandished

57:39.070 --> 57:42.610
by beings of extraordinary strength.

57:42.710 --> 57:44.200
Observe.

57:46.980 --> 57:52.790
These carriers can use the Stone
to mow down entire civilizations

57:52.890 --> 57:56.850
like wheat in a field.

57:57.890 --> 58:00.620
There's a little pee coming
out of me right now.

58:00.960 --> 58:02.260
Once, for a moment,

58:02.360 --> 58:06.470
a group was able to share the
energy amongst themselves,

58:06.570 --> 58:10.000
but even they were
quickly destroyed by it.

58:15.710 --> 58:17.870
Beautiful.

58:19.210 --> 58:22.150
Beyond compare.

58:23.850 --> 58:27.980
We're all very fascinated, whitey.
But we'd like to get paid.

58:29.420 --> 58:30.890
How would you like to get paid?

58:30.990 --> 58:33.480
What do you think, fancy man? Units!

58:34.460 --> 58:36.020
Very well, then.

58:41.170 --> 58:42.770
Carina.

58:42.870 --> 58:44.340
Stand back.

58:44.510 --> 58:47.210
I will no longer be your slave!

58:47.310 --> 58:49.240
No!

59:36.090 --> 59:37.620
What the...

59:46.600 --> 59:49.400
How could I think Tivan could contain
whatever was within the Orb?

59:49.500 --> 59:53.010
- What do you still have it for?
- What are we gonna do, leave it in there?

59:53.110 --> 59:56.980
- I can't believe you had that in your purse!
- It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!

59:57.080 --> 01:00:00.750
We have to bring this to the Nova Corps.
There's a chance they can contain it.

01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:03.650
Are you kidding me?
We're wanted by the Nova Corps.

01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:06.290
- Just give it to Ronan!
- So he can destroy the galaxy?

01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:08.190
What are you,
some saint all of a sudden?

01:00:08.290 --> 01:00:11.290
What has the galaxy ever done for you?
Why would you wanna save it?

01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:13.190
Because I'm one of the
idiots who lives in it!

01:00:13.290 --> 01:00:18.070
Peter, listen to me. We cannot allow
the Stone to fall into Ronan's hands.

01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:21.500
We have to go back to your
ship, and deliver it to Nova.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.440
Right, right, okay. I think you're right.

01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:28.740
Or we could give it to somebody
who's not going to arrest us,

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:32.010
who's really nice for
a whole lot of money.

01:00:32.110 --> 01:00:34.650
I think it's a really good balance
between both of your points of view.

01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:37.920
You're despicable. Dishonorable.

01:00:38.090 --> 01:00:39.550
Faithless!

01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:41.810
- No.
- At last!

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:46.460
I shall meet my foe and destroy him.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.720
You called Ronan?

01:00:53.130 --> 01:00:56.630
Quill! Don't you move, boy!

01:00:57.340 --> 01:00:59.900
Don't you move! Get out of the way!

01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:05.780
Ronan the Accuser!

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.420
You are the one who
transmitted the message?

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:10.280
You killed my wife.

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:13.020
You killed my daughter!

01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:24.330
I told you, you can't fit.
Now, wait here. I'll be back.

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:33.300
It is Gamora. She is
escaping with the Orb.

01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:43.280
No!

01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:44.850
Nebula,

01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:47.310
retrieve the Orb.

01:02:03.370 --> 01:02:05.740
The Stone is in the furthest pod.

01:02:05.970 --> 01:02:07.700
Bring it down!

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:39.040
Rocket, keep them off Gamora
until she gets to the Milano.

01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:41.580
How? We've got no
weaponry on these things.

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:43.510
These pods are industrial grade.

01:02:43.610 --> 01:02:44.810
They're nearly indestructible.

01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:47.520
Not against necroblasts, they're not.

01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:49.640
That's not what I'm saying.

01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:39.830
Let me borrow your ride.

01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:14.430
I don't recall killing your family.

01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:21.140
I doubt I'll remember killing you, either.

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:40.590
Quill, I'm trapped.
I can't make it to the Milano.

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:42.230
I have to head out.

01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:46.700
Wait! These things aren't
meant to go out there.

01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:55.610
You are a disappointment, sister.

01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:58.340
Of all our siblings,

01:04:58.710 --> 01:05:00.620
I hated you least.

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:01.980
Nebula, please.

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:04.020
If Ronan gets this stone

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:06.310
- he'll kill us all.
- Not all.

01:05:07.590 --> 01:05:09.720
You will already be dead.

01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:07.210
Ronan, it is done.

01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:11.310
Quill, come on.

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:13.960
Her body mods should keep her
alive a couple more minutes,

01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:16.120
but there's nothing we can do for her.

01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:17.790
These pods aren't
meant to be out here.

01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:20.760
In a second, we're gonna
be in the same boat.

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:30.570
Damn it.

01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:32.940
Quill?

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:35.080
Yondu! Yondu.

01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:36.210
This is Quill!

01:06:36.310 --> 01:06:39.980
- My coordinates are 227 K324.
- Quill.

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:41.320
Quill, what are you doing?

01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:42.920
Just outside Knowhere.

01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:45.610
If you're there, come get me.

01:06:45.850 --> 01:06:47.820
I'm all yours.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:59.230
Quill, don't be ridiculous.

01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:02.770
Get back into your pod!

01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:06.400
You can't fit two people in there.
You're gonna die.

01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:09.240
You'll die in seconds!

01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:10.940
Quill.

01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:13.700
Quill?

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:16.810
What happened?

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:20.000
I saw you out there.

01:08:20.979 --> 01:08:23.920
I don't know what came over me.

01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:26.680
But I couldn't let you die.

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:31.960
I found something inside of myself.

01:08:32.529 --> 01:08:34.160
Something

01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:36.660
incredibly heroic.

01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:40.569
I mean, not to brag,

01:08:40.670 --> 01:08:41.939
but, objectively...

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.529
Where's the Orb?

01:08:44.939 --> 01:08:47.240
It's... Well, they got the Orb.

01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:48.830
What?

01:08:51.109 --> 01:08:54.010
Welcome home, Peter.

01:09:16.439 --> 01:09:19.670
Blasted idiot. They're all idiots!

01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:22.840
Quill just got himself captured.

01:09:22.939 --> 01:09:27.319
None of this ever would have happened
if you didn't try to single-handedly

01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:29.109
take on a frickin' army!

01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:32.080
You're right.

01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:36.880
I was a fool.

01:09:38.890 --> 01:09:41.050
All the anger,

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:43.560
all the rage,

01:09:46.270 --> 01:09:49.029
was just to cover my loss.

01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:59.980
"My wife and child are dead."

01:10:01.050 --> 01:10:03.320
I don't care if it's mean!

01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:05.750
Everybody's got dead people.

01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:07.690
It's no excuse to get everybody else

01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:10.150
dead along the way!

01:10:13.530 --> 01:10:16.260
Come on, Groot. Ronan has the Stone.

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:19.570
The only chance we got is to get
to the other side of the universe

01:10:19.670 --> 01:10:21.640
as fast as we can and maybe,

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:26.830
just maybe, we'll be able to live full lives
before that whack-job ever gets there.

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:30.240
I am Groot.

01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:32.710
Save them? How?

01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:35.650
I am Groot.

01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:38.390
I know they're the only
friends that we ever had,

01:10:38.490 --> 01:10:41.290
but there's an army of
Ravagers around them.

01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:43.450
And there's only two of us!

01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:45.750
Three.

01:10:54.370 --> 01:10:56.670
You're making me

01:10:56.770 --> 01:10:58.410
beat... up

01:10:58.510 --> 01:10:59.970
grass!

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:04.240
The Orb is in my possession,

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.450
as I promised.

01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:08.180
Bring it to me.

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:12.050
Yes, that was our agreement.

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:14.060
Bring you the Orb,

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:17.760
and you will destroy Xandar for me.

01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:22.460
However, now that I know
it contains an Infinity Stone,

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.670
I wonder what use I have for you.

01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:26.500
Boy,

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:29.470
I would reconsider your current course.

01:11:30.170 --> 01:11:32.510
Master! You cannot!

01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:35.570
Thanos is the most powerful
being in the universe.

01:11:35.710 --> 01:11:37.840
Not anymore.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:02.540
You call me "boy!"

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:07.240
I will unfurl 1,000 years
of Kree justice on Xandar,

01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:10.910
and burn it to its core!

01:12:11.010 --> 01:12:13.010
Then, Thanos,

01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:15.550
I am coming for you.

01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:20.760
After Xandar, you are
going to kill my father?

01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:22.760
You dare to oppose me?

01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:24.660
You see what he has turned me into.

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:29.490
If you kill him, I will help you
destroy a thousand planets.

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:31.760
You betray me?

01:12:32.230 --> 01:12:33.270
Steal my money?

01:12:33.370 --> 01:12:35.270
Stop it! Leave him alone!

01:12:35.370 --> 01:12:37.510
When I picked you up as a kid,

01:12:37.610 --> 01:12:40.010
these boys wanted to eat you.

01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:42.610
They ain't never tasted Terran before.

01:12:42.710 --> 01:12:44.380
I saved your life!

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:46.710
Will you shut up about that? God!

01:12:46.810 --> 01:12:49.120
Twenty years, you been
throwing that in my face,

01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:51.920
like it's some great thing, not eating me.

01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:55.660
Normal people don't even think
about eating someone else!

01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:58.290
Much less that person
having to be grateful for it!

01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:59.950
You abducted me, man.

01:13:00.530 --> 01:13:02.830
You stole me from my
home and from my family.

01:13:02.930 --> 01:13:05.470
You don't give a damn
about your Terra!

01:13:05.570 --> 01:13:06.630
You're scared

01:13:06.730 --> 01:13:08.840
because you're soft in here.

01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:10.270
Here, right here!

01:13:10.370 --> 01:13:11.440
Yondu!

01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:12.740
Listen to me.

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:15.080
Ronan has something
called an Infinity Stone.

01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:17.110
I know what he's got, girl.

01:13:17.210 --> 01:13:19.550
Then you know we must get it back!

01:13:19.650 --> 01:13:23.120
He's gonna use it to wipe out Xandar.

01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:26.220
We have to warn them.
Billions of people will perish.

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:28.960
Is that what she's been
filling your head with, boy?

01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:30.520
Sentiment?

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.820
Eating away your brain like maggots!

01:13:38.130 --> 01:13:40.000
That's it.

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:41.600
No!

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:42.870
Sorry, boy.

01:13:42.970 --> 01:13:46.540
But a captain's gotta teach his men
what happens to those what cross him.

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:48.370
Captain's gotta teach stuff!

01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:53.050
If you kill me now,

01:13:53.150 --> 01:13:57.670
you are saying goodbye to the
biggest score you have ever seen.

01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:04.290
The Stone?

01:14:04.590 --> 01:14:06.590
I hope you got something
better than that.

01:14:06.690 --> 01:14:09.790
Because ain't nobody
stealing from Ronan.

01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:11.900
We got a ringer.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.900
Is that right?

01:14:14.570 --> 01:14:17.000
She knows everything there
is to know about Ronan.

01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:18.410
His ships,

01:14:18.510 --> 01:14:20.110
his army.

01:14:20.210 --> 01:14:22.500
He's vulnerable.

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:24.150
Hey, what do you say, Yondu?

01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:28.270
Me and you, taking down a mark
side-by-side, like the old days.

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:37.050
Let him go!

01:14:38.330 --> 01:14:40.930
You always did have a scrote, boy!

01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:44.220
That's why I kept you on as a young'un.

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:54.070
Captain, the shot was non-damaging.

01:14:54.170 --> 01:14:56.840
Attention, idiots.

01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:02.320
The lunatic on top of this craft
is holding a Hadron Enforcer.

01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:04.190
It's a weapon of my own design.

01:15:04.290 --> 01:15:05.790
What the hell?

01:15:05.890 --> 01:15:08.660
If you don't hand over
our companions now,

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:11.130
he's gonna tear your ship a new one.

01:15:11.230 --> 01:15:13.060
A very big new one!

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:16.430
- I ain't buyin' it.
- I'm giving you to the count of five.

01:15:16.530 --> 01:15:19.700
- 5, 4, 3...
- No! Wait, hold on!

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:21.640
Rocket, it's me, for God sakes!

01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:23.800
We figured it out! We're fine!

01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:25.560
Hey, Quill. What's going on?

01:15:27.010 --> 01:15:28.640
You call that "figured it out"?

01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:31.110
We're gonna rob the guys
who just beat us senseless.

01:15:31.210 --> 01:15:32.650
You want to talk about senseless?

01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:35.020
How about trying to save
us by blowing us up?

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.950
We were only gonna blow you
up if they didn't turn you over!

01:15:38.050 --> 01:15:39.920
And how on earth were
they gonna turn us over

01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:41.580
when you only gave
them a count of five?

01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:45.160
We didn't have time to work
out the minutiae of the plan.

01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:47.530
This is what we get for
acting altruistically.

01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:49.800
- I am Groot.
- They are ungrateful.

01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:53.970
What's important now is we get the
Ravagers' army to help us save Xandar.

01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:57.840
So we can give the Stone to Yondu who's
just gonna sell to somebody even worse?

01:15:57.940 --> 01:16:01.010
- We'll figure that part out later.
- We have to stop Ronan.

01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:02.580
How?

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:05.250
- I have a plan.
- You've got a plan?

01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:06.410
Yes.

01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:08.950
First of all, you're copying me
from when I said I had a plan.

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:12.550
No, I'm not. People say that all the time.
It's not that unique of a thing to say.

01:16:12.650 --> 01:16:14.560
Secondly, I don't even
believe you have a plan.

01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:17.460
I have part of a plan!

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.090
What percentage of
a plan do you have?

01:16:19.190 --> 01:16:22.400
You don't get to ask questions after
the nonsense you pulled on Knowhere.

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:24.130
I just saved Quill.

01:16:24.230 --> 01:16:26.970
We've already established that you destroying
the ship that I'm on is not saving me.

01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:29.300
- When did we establish it?
- Like three seconds ago!

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.480
I wasn't listening. I was
thinking of something else.

01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:35.140
She's right. You don't get an opinion.
What percentage?

01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:38.470
- I don't know. Twelve percent.
- Twelve percent?

01:16:40.010 --> 01:16:41.220
That's a fake laugh.

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:43.050
- It's real!
- Totally fake.

01:16:43.150 --> 01:16:47.820
That is the most real, authentic,
hysterical laugh of my entire life

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:50.360
- because that is not a plan.
- It's barely a concept.

01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:53.060
- You're taking their side?
- I am Groot.

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:56.100
So what, it's better than 11%? What the
hell does that have to do with anything?

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:58.830
Thank you, Groot. Thank you.

01:16:58.930 --> 01:17:02.830
See? Groot's the only one
of you who has a clue.

01:17:07.410 --> 01:17:08.900
Guys.

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:10.410
Come on.

01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:12.510
Yondu is gonna be here in two seconds.

01:17:12.610 --> 01:17:15.580
He expects to hear this big plan of ours.

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:18.850
I need your help.

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:22.860
I look around at us.

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:24.450
You know what I see?

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:26.430
Losers.

01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:30.230
I mean, like,

01:17:30.330 --> 01:17:32.270
folks who have lost stuff.

01:17:32.370 --> 01:17:34.990
And we have. Man, we have. All of us.

01:17:35.670 --> 01:17:37.430
Our homes,

01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:39.540
our families,

01:17:40.210 --> 01:17:42.180
normal lives.

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:45.470
And, usually, life takes more
than it gives. But not today.

01:17:45.850 --> 01:17:47.450
Today, it's given us something.

01:17:47.550 --> 01:17:49.150
It has given us a chance.

01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:51.050
To do what?

01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:54.250
To give a shit.

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.460
For once.

01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:59.030
Not run away.

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:03.900
I, for one, am not gonna
stand by and watch

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.520
as Ronan wipes out
billions of innocent lives.

01:18:08.170 --> 01:18:11.230
But, Quill, stopping Ronan,

01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:14.310
it's impossible.

01:18:14.410 --> 01:18:17.170
You're asking us to die.

01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:25.710
Yeah, I guess I am.

01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:39.690
Quill.

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:47.200
I have lived most my life
surrounded by my enemies.

01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:55.440
I will be grateful to
die among my friends.

01:18:59.290 --> 01:19:01.690
You are an honorable man, Quill.

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:05.580
I will fight beside you.

01:19:06.330 --> 01:19:08.290
And in the end,

01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:12.290
I will see my wife and daughter again.

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:21.430
I am Groot.

01:19:31.290 --> 01:19:34.980
What the hell. I don't got
that long a lifespan, anyway.

01:19:40.530 --> 01:19:43.160
Now I'm standing. Y'all happy?

01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:45.500
We're all standing up now.

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:49.300
Bunch of jackasses,
standing in a circle.

01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:57.640
The Stone reacts to anything organic.

01:19:57.740 --> 01:19:59.780
The bigger the target,
the bigger the power surge.

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:03.120
All Ronan's got to do is touch the
Stone to the planet's surface and zap.

01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:04.920
All plants, animals,

01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:06.950
- Nova Corps.
- Everything will die.

01:20:07.150 --> 01:20:09.550
So Ronan does not make the surface.

01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:14.090
Rocket will lead a team to blow a hole

01:20:14.190 --> 01:20:16.400
in the Dark Aster's starboard hull.

01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:20.570
Then, our craft and Yondu's will enter.

01:20:20.670 --> 01:20:23.440
Won't there be hundreds of
Sakaaran soldiers inside?

01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:26.840
I think of Sakaaran as paper people.

01:20:32.210 --> 01:20:33.650
Once they know we're on board,

01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:37.150
Ronan will isolate himself behind
impenetrable security doors on deck.

01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:39.750
Which I can disable by
dismantling the power source.

01:20:39.850 --> 01:20:41.560
We'll make it to the flight deck,

01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:45.120
and I'll use the Hadron
Enforcer to kill Ronan.

01:20:47.230 --> 01:20:50.700
Once Ronan is dead,
we will retrieve the Stone.

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:53.230
Use these devices to contain it.

01:20:53.330 --> 01:20:55.130
If you touch it,

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:57.200
it will kill you.

01:20:59.570 --> 01:21:02.810
I'll contact one of the Nova
officers who arrested us.

01:21:02.910 --> 01:21:06.000
Hopefully, they'll believe
we're there to help.

01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:09.740
There's one more thing we
need to complete the plan.

01:21:10.050 --> 01:21:11.710
That guy's eye.

01:21:12.190 --> 01:21:14.760
No! No, we don't. No, we don't need

01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:16.650
that guy's eye.

01:21:17.290 --> 01:21:20.350
No, seriously, I need it!
It's important to me.

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:27.500
Ronan's fleet has been spotted,
and will arrive in T-minus

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:29.500
fifteen minutes.

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:31.440
Remember, boy.

01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:33.470
At the end of all this,

01:21:33.570 --> 01:21:34.910
I get the Stone.

01:21:35.010 --> 01:21:37.910
You cross me, we kill you all.

01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:01.900
Let's go get 'em, boys!

01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:12.250
This is a terrible plan.

01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:14.910
Hey, you're the one who said
you wanted to die among friends.

01:22:19.390 --> 01:22:20.850
Nova Prime.

01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:23.360
I received a transmission

01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:25.150
from one of the Ravagers.

01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:27.900
He says Ronan's in possession of
something called an Infinity Stone

01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:29.360
and he's headed toward Xandar.

01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:30.730
Good God.

01:22:30.830 --> 01:22:32.800
It's a trick. He's a criminal.

01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:35.370
Did he say why we should believe him?

01:22:35.470 --> 01:22:37.700
He said his crew just
escaped from prison

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:41.240
so he'd have no other reason to
risk coming to Xandar to help.

01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:43.200
He says that he's an

01:22:43.810 --> 01:22:45.110
"a-hole."

01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:46.480
But he's not,

01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:48.320
and I'm quoting him, here,

01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:50.720
"100% a dick."

01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:52.580
Do you believe him?

01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:55.820
I don't know that I believe
anyone is 100% a dick, ma'am.

01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:59.320
I mean, do you believe
that he is here to help?

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:04.030
Yeah.

01:23:13.670 --> 01:23:15.480
A fleet approaches.

01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:17.630
They appear to be Ravagers.

01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:29.810
Fire!

01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:41.940
Cover it down.

01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:44.400
Submerge!

01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:58.540
Rocket, hurry!

01:24:04.590 --> 01:24:05.860
All pilots, dive!

01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:07.590
They're beneath us!

01:24:15.970 --> 01:24:17.440
Evacuate the city.

01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:21.500
Our priority is to get our
people away from the battle.

01:24:28.010 --> 01:24:29.500
Forward thrust, now!

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:44.060
Come on!

01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:47.320
Quill! Yondu! Now!

01:25:09.190 --> 01:25:10.760
Hell!

01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:12.360
I'm going down, Quill!

01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:14.260
No more games with me, boy!

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:15.460
I'll see you

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:17.760
at the end of this!

01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:25.470
There are too many of them, Rocket!

01:25:25.770 --> 01:25:27.970
We'll never make it up there!

01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:43.720
Peter Quill.

01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:46.260
This is Denarian Saal
of the Nova Corps.

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:49.730
For the record, I advised
against trusting you here.

01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:51.530
They got my "dick" message!

01:25:51.630 --> 01:25:53.260
Prove me wrong.

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:02.570
Yes!

01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:24.850
Yes!

01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:29.960
We're just like Kevin Bacon.

01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:35.310
The starboard Kern has been breached!

01:26:35.410 --> 01:26:36.710
We have been boarded.

01:26:36.810 --> 01:26:38.280
Continue our approach.

01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:39.710
But the Nova Corps have engaged.

01:26:39.810 --> 01:26:42.480
None of that will matter
once we reach the surface.

01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:43.680
Seal security doors!

01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:45.270
Now!

01:26:46.590 --> 01:26:49.320
Get out of my way!

01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:01.670
Oh, man.

01:27:01.770 --> 01:27:06.210
All Nova pilots,
interlock and form a blockade.

01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:10.610
The Dark Aster must
not reach the ground.

01:27:22.690 --> 01:27:24.320
Locked in!

01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:26.320
Locked in.

01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:28.930
We're locked in.

01:28:06.770 --> 01:28:09.360
I can barely see.

01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:37.460
When did you learn to do that?

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:38.730
Pretty sure the answer is

01:28:38.830 --> 01:28:40.860
"I am Groot."

01:28:41.570 --> 01:28:44.540
The flight deck is 300 meters this way.

01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:51.140
I want you all to know that I am grateful
for your acceptance after my blunders.

01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:53.940
It is pleasing to once again have

01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:55.550
friends.

01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:59.050
You, Quill, are my friend.

01:28:59.150 --> 01:29:00.420
Thanks.

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:03.080
This dumb tree, he is my friend.

01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:08.060
- And this green whore, she, too...
- You must stop!

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:16.100
Gamora, look at what you have done.
You have always been weak.

01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:18.760
You stupid, traitorous...

01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:26.270
Nobody talks to my friends like that.

01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:31.270
Head to the flight deck. I'll shut
down the power to the security doors.

01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:40.690
Yondu Udonta.

01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:44.750
Order your men to turn
on the Nova Corps.

01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:02.680
Enough nonsense, Ravager!

01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:05.050
Time to die...

01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:38.770
Nebula, please.

01:30:52.830 --> 01:30:55.640
Enough of this. Necrocraft pilots,

01:30:55.740 --> 01:30:58.260
enact immolation initiative.

01:31:01.340 --> 01:31:02.840
They're dive-bombing the city!

01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:04.780
Denarian Saal,
should we break formation?

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.970
No! Hold your positions.

01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:39.650
Keep Ronan up there, Saal.

01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:41.380
We'll take care of the
people down here.

01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:44.110
I can't believe I'm taking
orders from a hamster.

01:31:46.850 --> 01:31:48.450
Star-Lord.

01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:50.020
Finally.

01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:01.990
You thief!

01:32:13.410 --> 01:32:16.710
You will never make it to Ronan.

01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:24.720
Everybody shoot them
before they hit the ground.

01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:34.730
Come on!

01:33:17.110 --> 01:33:21.050
Finger to the throat means death.

01:33:26.420 --> 01:33:27.890
Metaphor.

01:33:27.990 --> 01:33:29.320
Yeah, sorta.

01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:31.050
No.

01:33:58.550 --> 01:34:00.450
Xandar!

01:34:00.650 --> 01:34:03.710
You stand accused.

01:34:04.090 --> 01:34:07.160
Your wretched peace treaty will not

01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:08.860
save you now.

01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:12.660
It is the tinder on which you burn.

01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:37.890
Rocket!

01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:40.220
Hold on, Saal, just...

01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:07.790
Quill, you gotta hurry.

01:35:07.890 --> 01:35:09.520
The city's been evacuated,

01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:12.190
but we're getting our
asses kicked down here.

01:35:12.290 --> 01:35:14.190
Gamora hasn't opened the door!

01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:39.920
Nebula!

01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:43.620
Sister, help us fight Ronan.

01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:45.560
You know he's crazy.

01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:47.760
I know you're both crazy.

01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:49.490
No!

01:35:51.930 --> 01:35:53.400
What the?

01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:56.190
Get out!

01:36:37.140 --> 01:36:38.610
You did it!

01:37:04.670 --> 01:37:05.940
I was mistaken.

01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:08.100
I do remember your family.

01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:10.080
Their screams were

01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:12.740
pitiful. I...

01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:10.990
No, Groot!

01:39:11.130 --> 01:39:12.230
You can't.

01:39:12.330 --> 01:39:14.260
You'll die.

01:39:14.370 --> 01:39:16.270
Why are you doing this?

01:39:16.370 --> 01:39:18.300
Why?

01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:26.350
We

01:39:26.450 --> 01:39:27.930
are

01:39:28.110 --> 01:39:30.050
Groot.

01:40:34.010 --> 01:40:36.500
I called him an idiot.

01:40:58.770 --> 01:41:01.170
You killed Groot!

01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:06.610
Behold!

01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:10.520
Your guardians of the galaxy.

01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:13.050
What fruit have they wrought?

01:41:13.150 --> 01:41:17.260
Only that my father and his father

01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:20.990
shall finally know vengeance.

01:41:21.090 --> 01:41:23.790
People of Xandar,

01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:25.770
the time has come

01:41:25.870 --> 01:41:28.730
to rejoice and renounce

01:41:28.830 --> 01:41:31.530
your paltry gods!

01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:35.700
Your salvation is at hand.

01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:49.950
Listen to these words.

01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:00.690
Now bring it down hard!

01:42:03.670 --> 01:42:05.140
What are you doing?

01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:08.260
Dance-off, bro. Me and you.

01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:13.110
Gamora.

01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:16.080
Subtle. Take it back.

01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:18.620
What are you doing?

01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:21.520
I'm distracting you,
you big turd blossom.

01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:39.260
No!

01:43:12.770 --> 01:43:16.370
Peter! Take my hand!

01:43:21.310 --> 01:43:23.780
Take my hand, Peter.

01:43:24.250 --> 01:43:26.050
Mom.

01:43:26.150 --> 01:43:28.680
Take my hand!

01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:24.680
You're mortal!

01:44:24.780 --> 01:44:26.110
How?

01:44:26.210 --> 01:44:28.410
You said it yourself, bitch.

01:44:28.510 --> 01:44:31.350
We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

01:45:00.750 --> 01:45:02.410
Well, well, well.

01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:04.040
Quite the light show.

01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:08.010
Ain't this sweet.

01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:11.660
But you got some business to attend to

01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:14.660
before all the nookie-nookie starts.

01:45:15.890 --> 01:45:18.130
Peter, you can't. Peter.

01:45:18.230 --> 01:45:22.330
You gotta reconsider this, Yondu.
I don't know who you're selling this to,

01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:26.660
but the only way the universe can survive
is if you give it to the Nova Corps.

01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:29.670
I may be as pretty as an angel,

01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:33.810
but I sure as hell ain't one.

01:45:35.050 --> 01:45:37.010
Hand it over, son.

01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:54.870
Yondu.

01:45:57.500 --> 01:46:01.230
Do not open that Orb.
You know that, right?

01:46:01.410 --> 01:46:04.340
You've seen what it does to people.

01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:17.320
Yeah, Quill turned out okay.

01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:20.360
It's probably good we didn't
deliver him to his dad

01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:21.460
like we was hired to do.

01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:24.760
Yeah, that guy was a jackass.

01:46:29.170 --> 01:46:33.200
He is gonna be so pissed when he
realizes I switched out the Orb on him.

01:46:35.470 --> 01:46:37.770
He was gonna kill you, Peter.

01:46:38.540 --> 01:46:40.670
I know.

01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:44.170
But he was about the only family I had.

01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:48.110
No.

01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:50.580
He wasn't.

01:47:38.370 --> 01:47:39.940
Why would you even know this?

01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:42.780
When we arrested you, we noticed
an anomaly in your nervous system,

01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:44.740
so we had it checked out.

01:47:45.580 --> 01:47:47.280
I'm not Terran?

01:47:47.380 --> 01:47:48.950
You are half Terran.

01:47:49.050 --> 01:47:52.750
Your mother was of Earth.
Your father, well,

01:47:52.850 --> 01:47:56.620
he's something very ancient
we've never seen here before.

01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:00.750
That could be why you were able to
hold the Stone for as long as you did.

01:48:01.190 --> 01:48:02.660
Your friends have arrived.

01:48:04.100 --> 01:48:06.670
On behalf of the Nova Corps,

01:48:06.770 --> 01:48:12.360
we'd like to express our profound
gratitude for your help in saving Xandar.

01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:16.510
If you will follow Denarian Dey,

01:48:16.610 --> 01:48:20.370
- he has something to show you.
- Thank you, Nova Prime.

01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:33.630
Your wife and child shall rest well
knowing that you have avenged them.

01:48:33.730 --> 01:48:34.960
Yes.

01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:37.430
Of course, Ronan was only a puppet.

01:48:37.730 --> 01:48:40.360
It's really Thanos I need to kill.

01:48:42.570 --> 01:48:45.800
We tried to keep it as close
to the original as possible.

01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:48.370
We salvaged as much as we could.

01:48:51.010 --> 01:48:52.480
I...

01:48:54.010 --> 01:48:55.570
Thank you.

01:48:56.680 --> 01:48:58.750
I have a family.

01:48:58.850 --> 01:49:00.780
They're alive because of you.

01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:07.460
Your criminal records
have also been expunged.

01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:11.960
However, I have to warn you against
breaking any laws in the future.

01:49:12.130 --> 01:49:14.430
Question. What if I see
something that I want to take,

01:49:14.530 --> 01:49:17.200
- and it belongs to someone else?
- You will be arrested.

01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:19.910
But what if I want it more
than the person who has it?

01:49:20.010 --> 01:49:21.810
- It's still illegal.
- That doesn't follow.

01:49:21.910 --> 01:49:24.640
No, I want it more, sir. Do you
understand? What are you laughing at?

01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:26.580
Why? I can't have a discussion
with this gentleman?

01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:28.580
What if someone does
something irksome

01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:31.340
and I decide to remove his spine?

01:49:32.450 --> 01:49:34.010
That's...

01:49:34.650 --> 01:49:37.310
That's actually murder.

01:49:38.660 --> 01:49:41.260
It's one of the worst crimes of all.

01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:44.660
So... also illegal.

01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:49.290
They'll be fine, Dey.

01:49:49.530 --> 01:49:50.770
I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em.

01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:52.340
You?

01:49:55.340 --> 01:49:58.780
Yeah. Me.

01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:19.290
Peter,

01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:23.200
I know these last few months
have been hard for you.

01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:26.710
But I'm going to a better place.

01:50:26.810 --> 01:50:29.310
And I will be okay.

01:50:29.410 --> 01:50:33.610
And I will always be with you.

01:50:34.850 --> 01:50:37.580
You are the light of my life.

01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:40.380
My precious son.

01:50:40.890 --> 01:50:44.290
My little Star-Lord.

01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:46.990
Love, Mom.

01:52:47.110 --> 01:52:48.980
So, what should we do next?

01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:50.550
Something good?

01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:52.620
Something bad?

01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:54.810
A bit of both?

01:52:55.990 --> 01:52:59.350
We'll follow your lead, Star-Lord.

01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:02.650
Bit of both.

02:00:26.540 --> 02:00:29.300
What do you let it lick you like that for?

02:00:30.170 --> 02:00:32.200
Gross.

02:00:34.780 --> 02:00:36.349
Yeah!

02:00:36.350 --> 02:00:38.640
But it burns going down.
