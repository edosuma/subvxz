00:00.242 --> 00:02.762
Queen Killer by Queen

00:28.266 --> 00:29.289
Hello.

00:29.510 --> 00:31.442
Yes. As agreed,

00:31.453 --> 00:33.133
I'll be there in ten minutes.

00:33.133 --> 00:34.893
OK. Give me 15.

02:13.213 --> 02:15.213
I'm sorry I'm a bit late.

02:15.213 --> 02:17.093
Yeah, well, sit down.

02:19.653 --> 02:22.853
Well, I'd love to say that I'm happy
to see you all, but I'm not.

02:22.853 --> 02:25.653
I never have meetings, I don't want
to have this one.

02:25.653 --> 02:28.453
I need to know that what happened
last night won't happen again.

02:28.453 --> 02:31.413
This has got to be closure. Well?

02:31.413 --> 02:33.173
I think we've dealt with it.

02:33.173 --> 02:34.853
Berna?

02:34.853 --> 02:36.853
Last night we didn't ask Berna
to join us.

02:36.853 --> 02:38.893
- Why not?
- Because the problem wasn't her fault.

02:38.893 --> 02:40.973
Spared the unpleasantness, was she?

02:42.933 --> 02:45.653
So whose fault was it?

02:45.653 --> 02:48.853
Laurie turned out to be religious
and was going to talk.

02:48.853 --> 02:50.813
Did she know what she was
being paid for?

02:50.813 --> 02:53.813
Not at first. But she was always
going to put two and two together.

02:53.813 --> 02:55.893
At first she didn't want to take it.

02:55.893 --> 02:57.813
She kept asking, "What am I being
paid for?"

02:57.813 --> 03:00.173
- And how much did you give her?
- A grand.

03:00.173 --> 03:02.493
- Where is it?
- The grand?

03:02.868 --> 03:04.250
Yes.

03:04.724 --> 03:06.722
Erm, I don't know.

03:06.733 --> 03:08.333
Looks like a loose end.

03:08.333 --> 03:09.813
Not quite closure, is it?

03:12.453 --> 03:14.733
Berna, they do a very good bacon
sandwich.

03:14.733 --> 03:16.773
- No, thank you.
- No, really.

03:16.784 --> 03:19.842
It's on me. You're not
religious, are you?

03:19.853 --> 03:22.133
No, not me, Peter.

03:22.144 --> 03:25.173
I'm secular. Secular, but not hungry.

03:27.533 --> 03:29.853
So tell me, are there
any other loose ends?

03:29.853 --> 03:32.413
There's a crazy entrepreneur
called Mikey Gowans.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.093
He sends out drugs with pizza.

03:34.093 --> 03:36.453
And was Mikey working alone?

03:36.453 --> 03:39.773
Ah, I've stumbled on something else!

03:39.773 --> 03:41.253
Laurie was getting a cut.

03:41.264 --> 03:42.308
Oh, very religious!

03:42.319 --> 03:44.695
She'd take Mikey's money but
she didn't want to take yours?

03:44.706 --> 03:48.164
Well, that's the point we put to her.
In the back of the van, before...

03:48.175 --> 03:49.973
Everyone has red lines, don't they?

03:49.973 --> 03:54.133
- Do they? You tell me, where are yours?
- The job was badly prepared.

03:54.133 --> 03:55.453
On your side.

03:56.733 --> 03:58.773
The Iraqi was taken out cleanly.

03:58.773 --> 04:00.693
It was properly planned.

04:00.693 --> 04:03.733
Laurie was bungled at speed
and dumped down Shadwell way.

04:03.733 --> 04:06.093
Not the same thing, is it?

04:06.104 --> 04:09.733
And what I'd really like to know is
where are the police in all this?

04:09.733 --> 04:11.013
Berna?

04:11.013 --> 04:13.013
What?

04:13.013 --> 04:15.293
Sometimes you've been able to help us.

04:15.293 --> 04:18.813
- Help you how?
- With things you know that we don't,

04:18.813 --> 04:22.213
in the past. Like when we closed
down the Bari route,

04:22.213 --> 04:23.453
that was your tip-off.

04:23.453 --> 04:25.973
Yes. In the Mediterranean.

04:25.973 --> 04:28.253
Long way from Kennington.

04:30.653 --> 04:32.893
Just remind me, what are your plans?

04:34.213 --> 04:36.293
I'm going back to Izmir.

04:36.293 --> 04:37.453
When?

04:37.453 --> 04:39.133
Tomorrow,

04:39.133 --> 04:41.653
to get new boats and find a new captain.

04:42.933 --> 04:44.413
Good. Tomorrow?

04:45.413 --> 04:47.093
Yes.

04:47.093 --> 04:48.653
What time?

04:49.693 --> 04:51.613
Later in the day.

04:55.733 --> 04:57.613
From Gatwick.

04:57.613 --> 04:59.093
At five.

05:01.813 --> 05:04.693
Gentlemen, I can't pretend
I'm happy. I'm not.

05:04.693 --> 05:07.740
I'm not a gambler but I
recognise a streak of bad luck

05:07.751 --> 05:10.068
when I see it and I don't like it.

05:10.185 --> 05:12.093
Human transport's the gift
that keeps on giving,

05:12.093 --> 05:14.853
or has until now. We're all rich men.

05:14.853 --> 05:19.613
I came from the military
and I expect military standards.

05:20.973 --> 05:22.613
And on your side?

05:22.613 --> 05:24.413
What?

05:24.413 --> 05:27.693
No, you just said, the planning
was bad on our side.

05:27.693 --> 05:30.813
- Yeah?
- And now I can see you're worried.

05:32.173 --> 05:33.213
So?

05:34.293 --> 05:37.465
We all agree, the second
murder was messy,

05:37.476 --> 05:39.606
but I'm asking, on your side?

05:39.738 --> 05:43.213
The first murder. For instance,
the shooter -

05:43.213 --> 05:44.893
everything OK?

05:48.453 --> 05:50.213
I'll take care of the shooter.

05:50.213 --> 05:52.813
The shooter's highly competent.
That's my business.

05:56.213 --> 05:58.653
Gentlemen, thanks.

07:37.173 --> 07:40.373
It's not good, is it?
It doesn't make any sense.

07:40.384 --> 07:41.391
Why not?

07:41.402 --> 07:43.420
Because everything's screaming
that the two murders

07:43.431 --> 07:44.502
have got to be connected.

07:44.513 --> 07:46.209
Got to be. So?

07:46.220 --> 07:49.213
They're connected, but look at
them, they're completely different.

07:49.213 --> 07:50.681
Laurie was beaten up,

07:50.692 --> 07:53.252
smashed in the face, thrown
from a moving vehicle.

07:53.447 --> 07:56.533
Does that sound like a woman's
doing? I don't think so.

07:56.533 --> 07:58.293
We don't know the first one was a woman.

07:58.293 --> 08:00.733
- Don't we?
- All we've got is one stoned witness.

08:00.733 --> 08:02.853
Whatever, don't you think it's the
exact opposite

08:02.853 --> 08:06.173
of what we had on Monday?
Monday was clean and professional.

08:06.173 --> 08:08.413
- This is careless.
- Maybe.

08:08.413 --> 08:10.173
This is clumsy, Nathan.

08:10.173 --> 08:12.893
It's lazy. Fuzz Gupta said there was
a military connection,

08:12.893 --> 08:14.173
military ammunition.

08:14.173 --> 08:16.373
Does this look like
a military killing to you?

08:16.373 --> 08:18.573
- Look at this.
- What is it?

08:18.573 --> 08:20.653
Evening Standard website.

08:23.013 --> 08:24.893
Shit.

08:24.893 --> 08:27.635
How many people were at the
interview in Harlsfleet last night?

08:27.646 --> 08:28.655
Five.

08:28.666 --> 08:31.773
Two being interviewed,
you, me and another.

08:31.773 --> 08:33.275
And somehow it's all over the news

08:33.285 --> 08:35.442
12 hours later that Asif wasn't Syrian.

08:35.453 --> 08:38.573
He's Iraqi. And that means he was
an economic migrant.

08:38.573 --> 08:40.815
And that means bad thing.
He's not an asylum seeker,

08:40.826 --> 08:41.995
meaning good thing.

08:42.006 --> 08:43.402
Someone's leaking.

08:43.413 --> 08:45.453
Reads like they want to discredit
the victim.

08:45.453 --> 08:48.253
Precisely. It's got to be
that wanker from Millbank.

08:48.253 --> 08:49.292
Sam?

08:49.542 --> 08:51.628
Ever get the feeling
you're being played?

08:52.093 --> 08:54.133
- He'd never do that.
- Wouldn't he?

08:54.133 --> 08:56.373
I know you've got a boy-crush
on him. I haven't.

09:06.373 --> 09:08.253
Come on, pick up!

09:09.893 --> 09:12.293
- Berna?
- Westbourne's on to me.

09:12.293 --> 09:14.573
We need to meet up urgently.

09:18.573 --> 09:20.733
- Morning.
- Good morning.

09:20.733 --> 09:22.293
How's your head?

09:22.293 --> 09:23.653
Not too bad.

09:25.133 --> 09:28.413
Good morning, ladies. Well, that was
one special evening, wasn't it?

09:28.413 --> 09:31.853
Yes. I've got a terrible hangover, sir.

09:31.853 --> 09:34.813
This regiment certainly knows
how to throw a party.

09:46.333 --> 09:49.253
- Xan.
- Sandrine?

09:49.253 --> 09:51.813
You're not due back today.

09:51.813 --> 09:55.253
I know. I-I wondered if you could
give me some time.

09:55.253 --> 09:57.013
Erm, yes.

09:57.013 --> 09:59.373
I've got half an hour now
if that's any use.

09:59.373 --> 10:00.893
Come on through.

10:02.253 --> 10:05.773
I-I-I just think that people forget,
don't you?

10:05.773 --> 10:07.893
Or perhaps they just don't want to know.

10:07.893 --> 10:11.653
It-it's like we've come back
and nobody wants to be reminded.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.333
They would rather we stayed.

10:13.333 --> 10:16.733
They think that we can go off and
fight wars and that somehow nothing

10:16.733 --> 10:18.373
changes when we come home.

10:19.813 --> 10:23.893
Last year, no British soldier
died in action overseas.

10:23.893 --> 10:26.173
I mean, do you know
when that last happened?

10:26.173 --> 10:27.813
It was 1968.

10:27.813 --> 10:29.573
That's Afghanistan.

10:29.573 --> 10:30.893
Libya. Iraq.

10:30.893 --> 10:32.573
Kosovo. Bosnia. Sierra Leone.

10:32.573 --> 10:33.973
The Gulf. The Falklands.

10:33.973 --> 10:36.333
I mean, have I missed anything out?

10:36.333 --> 10:37.613
Northern Ireland.

10:39.413 --> 10:40.853
Of course.

10:42.973 --> 10:44.853
My father fought there.

10:44.853 --> 10:47.093
He was a hero?

10:48.333 --> 10:49.653
He was...

10:50.893 --> 10:52.413
..a great hero.

10:57.493 --> 10:59.453
Sandrine, what's this about?

11:00.453 --> 11:02.333
I've got the feeling
something's happened.

11:02.333 --> 11:06.013
Do you want to tell me about it?
Something in particular?

11:06.013 --> 11:08.493
No, nothing. Nothing's happened.

11:08.493 --> 11:09.653
Are you sure?

11:10.893 --> 11:12.413
Then why did you come to see me?

11:14.293 --> 11:16.013
There's no particular reason.

11:19.093 --> 11:21.933
I think you should consider
taking a little time off.

11:21.933 --> 11:24.093
I don't want to do that.

11:24.093 --> 11:26.813
I have no life but the Army.

11:26.813 --> 11:30.413
Yes, and that may be the reason you
should think about taking a break.

11:32.453 --> 11:34.373
Do you still have family?

11:35.493 --> 11:37.813
- My mother.
- OK.

11:37.813 --> 11:39.653
Would you stay with her for a while?

11:39.653 --> 11:41.213
What, is that an order, sir?

11:42.813 --> 11:44.253
Not yet.

11:49.693 --> 11:51.493
Coming back home, you...

11:53.013 --> 11:57.333
..you feel like a germ
that's entered the bloodstream.

12:10.493 --> 12:11.813
It's open.

12:13.053 --> 12:15.693
- Ah, you're back.
- Yes.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.453
Nobody's been here at all.

12:17.453 --> 12:18.933
No sign of Laurie all night.

12:18.933 --> 12:21.533
I've been calling the social services.

12:21.533 --> 12:25.093
No answers. Two hours of Johann Strauss.

12:27.253 --> 12:28.933
Have you found Laurie?

12:30.213 --> 12:31.693
I'm afraid we have.

12:47.053 --> 12:49.053
OK, in you go.

12:50.373 --> 12:52.573
OK, she's all yours.

12:54.173 --> 12:55.853
Are you all right there, love?

12:55.853 --> 12:57.893
Is it Mrs Stone?

13:10.213 --> 13:11.573
Karen!

13:12.573 --> 13:15.653
You have to get up. You really have to.

13:15.653 --> 13:16.693
Karen!

13:19.435 --> 13:21.253
Karen!

13:23.133 --> 13:24.213
Karen!

13:24.213 --> 13:27.613
They want you out there sharpish
to give the nation your thoughts.

13:27.613 --> 13:29.613
- OK.
- And also Genevieve rang.

13:29.613 --> 13:31.066
Saying what?

13:31.077 --> 13:33.409
- My cheques aren't big enough?
- No. Karen's still in bed

13:33.420 --> 13:36.119
and somebody needs to take Lucy
to the hospital for her appointment.

13:36.130 --> 13:37.568
Do I need to know all this stuff?

13:37.579 --> 13:39.213
I mean, come on, it's perfectly obvious.

13:39.224 --> 13:41.813
It's a bid for attention from
a woman I left seven years ago.

13:41.813 --> 13:44.533
I'm sure. But what do you
want me to say?

13:44.533 --> 13:46.533
A couple of days ago,
I made a wrong turn.

13:46.533 --> 13:49.813
I had Suki Vincent in my bed
and I let her go.

13:49.813 --> 13:52.373
Why did you do that, David?
It's not rational.

13:52.373 --> 13:55.253
Tell that French au pair to get
my ex-wife out of bed.

13:55.901 --> 13:58.253
What's your reaction to the
overnight news that Asif

13:58.264 --> 14:00.347
wasn't in fact an asylum seeker?

14:00.493 --> 14:02.693
OK, so he turned out to be
an economic migrant,

14:02.693 --> 14:04.349
but that doesn't mean he wasn't entitled

14:04.360 --> 14:06.166
to the full protection of the law.

14:06.177 --> 14:07.853
But it is different, isn't it?

14:07.853 --> 14:10.053
Can't we just say he was a human being,

14:10.053 --> 14:12.453
who was shot down on a British street?

14:12.453 --> 14:14.573
It doesn't matter where he came from.

14:14.573 --> 14:17.654
We really are turning
into a nasty little country.

14:17.665 --> 14:20.477
And isn't it time we had
an immigration policy

14:20.488 --> 14:22.722
that wasn't just crass xenophobia?

14:22.733 --> 14:24.413
I-I've been arguing for some time

14:24.413 --> 14:26.693
that we need to fulfil our obligations,

14:26.693 --> 14:29.173
and I'm not just talking
about moral obligations,

14:29.173 --> 14:31.613
I'm talking about legal obligations -

14:31.613 --> 14:35.133
promises that were made that we
seem conveniently to have forgotten.

14:35.133 --> 14:38.653
Now, I believe that when the history
of this time comes to be written,

14:38.653 --> 14:42.853
we will feel ashamed of how few
refugees we let in to this country

14:42.853 --> 14:46.093
and how badly we treated them
when they were here.

14:47.573 --> 14:49.893
Thank you, David, that's great.

14:54.413 --> 14:56.573
You're having a marvellous run,
aren't you?

14:56.573 --> 14:58.213
Man shot down in the street,

14:58.224 --> 15:00.343
the next day spent looking
for a woman and you don't...

15:00.354 --> 15:02.366
- Where was she all day, by the way?
-  We don't yet know.

15:02.384 --> 15:05.385
You don't find her till she
turns up dead, it's brilliant.

15:05.396 --> 15:07.333
Anyone else you got your sights on?

15:07.333 --> 15:08.645
I think we should warn them,

15:08.656 --> 15:10.922
don't you, since
you seem to be a bit of a kiss of death.

15:10.933 --> 15:14.247
Aren't the first 24 hours meant to
be the best time to solve a crime,

15:14.258 --> 15:16.004
not make it worse?

15:16.015 --> 15:17.895
How many more are we planning to lose?

15:18.813 --> 15:20.093
Have you anything to say?

15:21.973 --> 15:23.373
So, let's sum up.

15:23.373 --> 15:24.893
First murder -

15:24.893 --> 15:27.373
a woman, perhaps, but you're not sure.

15:27.373 --> 15:29.973
- Possibly.
- Perhaps with an army background.

15:29.973 --> 15:32.253
We put a call into military police,
alerting them.

15:32.253 --> 15:33.853
Anyone gone AWOL, anyone missing.

15:33.853 --> 15:35.613
Some involvement, as yet unclear,

15:35.613 --> 15:38.133
with refugee traffic and also
a drug distribution business.

15:38.133 --> 15:39.887
I think we should be going after
Karen Mars.

15:39.898 --> 15:40.906
Tell me why.

15:40.917 --> 15:43.143
The killer has to know when and where
the pizza's going to be delivered.

15:43.154 --> 15:44.995
How can it work unless
the killing's a set-up?

15:45.006 --> 15:46.642
- Kip?
- I don't agree.

15:46.653 --> 15:49.278
Everyone at the pizza place knows
that Karen makes the same order,

15:49.289 --> 15:50.602
same time every week.

15:50.613 --> 15:52.813
And why? Cos the dope comes with it.

15:52.813 --> 15:54.973
I'm sorry, but no-one commits murder
for dope.

15:54.973 --> 15:56.613
Not any dope I've ever smoked.

15:56.613 --> 15:57.613
Nor me.

15:57.613 --> 15:59.331
What I want to know is,

15:59.342 --> 16:02.683
does anybody really believe this
could be a British soldier?

16:03.113 --> 16:05.133
Complicit in people smuggling?

16:05.133 --> 16:08.453
Going out to kill a refugee
in the street?

16:08.464 --> 16:09.906
I don't think so.

16:10.023 --> 16:12.213
So, second murder what's
the approach on that?

16:12.213 --> 16:15.013
Laurie Stone's body was thrown
from a moving vehicle.

16:15.013 --> 16:18.253
We're searching CCTV footage,
garages, approach roads,

16:18.253 --> 16:20.013
we can do the car regs on ANPR.

16:20.013 --> 16:22.053
We're searching the body for DNA traces.

16:22.053 --> 16:24.693
Ranks off. You know what I find
especially annoying?

16:24.693 --> 16:26.853
What annoys you?

16:26.853 --> 16:28.657
All the while we're sat here

16:28.668 --> 16:31.306
defining just how large a
Horlicks we're making,

16:31.373 --> 16:34.573
there's a woman locked up in
Harlsfleet who knows all the answers.

16:34.573 --> 16:36.573
Fatima Asif?

16:36.573 --> 16:40.493
She knows everything.
But she's not speaking.

16:45.973 --> 16:47.613
- What was all that about?
- What?

16:47.613 --> 16:48.933
- That bit at the end?
- Nathan?

16:48.933 --> 16:51.133
- Oh.
- The Vietnamese girl's finally arrived.

16:51.133 --> 16:53.373
- OK.
- She's brought along her vicar.

16:54.453 --> 16:56.573
Rakhee, give them a call at Harlsfleet,

16:56.573 --> 16:58.613
get me another appointment
as soon as possible.

16:58.613 --> 17:00.533
- Sure.
- Oh, don't tell anyone else.

17:09.813 --> 17:11.413
Ah, good.

17:11.413 --> 17:14.133
We met on the pavement, remember?
You were pretty far gone.

17:14.133 --> 17:15.772
We need you to go over your story,

17:15.772 --> 17:18.173
every detail, and we need you
to work with a police artist

17:18.173 --> 17:20.413
to give us an impression.
It's going to take time.

17:20.413 --> 17:22.053
Is it all right if I come in with her?

17:22.342 --> 17:23.748
Is she of age?

17:24.069 --> 17:25.096
She is 23.

17:25.107 --> 17:27.260
Then I don't think we're going to
need you, thanks for offering.

17:27.271 --> 17:28.498
And I wouldn't hang around, either,

17:28.509 --> 17:30.189
because this is going
to be a very long day.

17:30.200 --> 17:32.773
Please remember,
she's doing this voluntarily.

17:32.773 --> 17:35.413
No, she isn't. She was found
with a stash of drugs.

17:35.413 --> 17:37.453
She's doing it because it's the law.

17:37.453 --> 17:39.773
Miss Xuan Huy. Would you
like to step this way?

17:44.373 --> 17:46.133
She's impossible.

17:46.133 --> 17:48.213
- I'm sorry?
- My friend.

17:48.213 --> 17:50.733
She means well
but she doesn't understand.

17:50.733 --> 17:52.573
I got here from Vietnam.

17:52.573 --> 17:54.333
I'm tougher than she thinks.

17:54.333 --> 17:55.973
Yeah, that's my impression, too.

17:59.573 --> 18:02.253
This isn't the best restaurant
in the town by any means,

18:02.253 --> 18:04.293
but it is one of the nicest,

18:04.293 --> 18:07.133
because they have table-cloths
and proper napkins.

18:08.813 --> 18:10.893
I can't bear to eat without linen.

18:12.773 --> 18:14.373
Do you know what you're having?

18:15.573 --> 18:17.653
I always think steak is for men.

18:17.653 --> 18:19.813
Your father ate steak.

18:20.773 --> 18:22.093
I'd have fish.

18:23.413 --> 18:25.413
Or macaroni cheese.

18:29.013 --> 18:31.213
I still make macaroni.

18:31.213 --> 18:32.973
Properly, not bought in.

18:34.573 --> 18:35.893
Occasionally.

18:38.373 --> 18:41.093
Now everyone's gone...

18:44.333 --> 18:45.813
Yes.

18:49.813 --> 18:52.013
I haven't cleared out
your brother's room.

18:53.573 --> 18:54.693
No?

18:54.693 --> 18:56.413
I've left it.

18:58.493 --> 19:00.173
Well, I'm sure that's best.

19:03.973 --> 19:05.933
I read a book about bereavement.

19:14.413 --> 19:16.813
Don't do it until you feel you need to.

19:22.453 --> 19:24.053
The regiment did nothing.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.653
They sent me a letter first off.

19:28.653 --> 19:30.613
I remember.

19:30.613 --> 19:33.333
Then a visit from a lieutenant colonel.

19:35.653 --> 19:37.853
His uniform was dirty.

19:38.893 --> 19:41.813
He said he visited relatives all day.

19:41.813 --> 19:43.413
That's his job.

19:44.533 --> 19:47.293
- Had he known Michael?
- I couldn't say.

19:50.333 --> 19:52.133
He died for nothing, didn't he?

19:52.133 --> 19:54.813
Michael died fighting for his country.

19:57.693 --> 19:59.053
Yes.

20:01.853 --> 20:03.613
May I take your order, please?

20:05.853 --> 20:07.853
Have you decided what you want?

20:07.853 --> 20:11.053
Yes, I'll have the... fish.

20:15.653 --> 20:18.093
Your father had an interesting view.

20:19.093 --> 20:23.373
He said if you left any institution
without bitterness,

20:23.373 --> 20:25.333
it meant you'd beaten it.

20:25.333 --> 20:28.573
If you were bitter,
the institution had won.

20:31.053 --> 20:32.613
I know you.

20:34.653 --> 20:37.653
I should think you'd be bored now
you're back from your tour.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.773
Nothing to do.

20:39.773 --> 20:42.253
You like doing.

20:42.253 --> 20:43.813
I'm not bored.

20:45.133 --> 20:46.933
Aimless, maybe.

20:49.773 --> 20:51.653
I want to go back to the battlefront.

20:52.773 --> 20:55.013
I'm not sure they'll let me.

20:55.013 --> 20:57.613
- Why not?
- Oh, you know.

20:57.613 --> 21:01.453
Office politics. Who's in, who's out.

21:01.453 --> 21:03.053
Are you out?

21:04.533 --> 21:06.413
You know me, Mum,

21:06.413 --> 21:07.813
I've never been in.

21:12.213 --> 21:14.813
You've a lot to give, Sandrine.

21:14.813 --> 21:16.573
Don't let it waste.

21:31.373 --> 21:34.013
You haven't told me why you're here.

21:35.573 --> 21:37.813
Today.

21:37.813 --> 21:41.453
There's a man advising me at work,

21:41.453 --> 21:44.653
who said perhaps I should
come home for a while.

21:47.853 --> 21:49.813
I'm not sure I'd want that.

21:51.093 --> 21:53.733
It's very kind of you, but...

21:53.733 --> 21:56.173
you're an independent girl.

21:56.173 --> 21:58.093
- Do you mind?
- No.

22:00.813 --> 22:03.493
Don't you think we should deal
with this separately?

22:05.453 --> 22:07.413
I can't bear to be looked at.

22:08.493 --> 22:10.493
By anyone.

22:10.493 --> 22:13.373
I don't want my grief to be seen.

22:15.213 --> 22:18.133
- Of course, if you feel differently...
- No.

22:19.333 --> 22:21.533
You must say if that's what you want.

22:21.533 --> 22:23.453
No, I'll do something else.

22:41.957 --> 22:44.219
- So it's agreed, yep?
- Suki,

22:44.230 --> 22:45.962
you might want to come and see this.

22:45.973 --> 22:48.373
Right, we'll talk later.

22:48.373 --> 22:51.493
OK, so he turned out to be
an economic migrant,

22:51.493 --> 22:53.154
but that doesn't mean he wasn't entitled

22:53.165 --> 22:54.882
to the full protection of the law.

22:54.893 --> 22:56.653
But it is different, isn't it?

22:56.653 --> 22:59.082
Can't we just say he was a human being

22:59.093 --> 23:00.985
that was shot down on a British street?

23:00.996 --> 23:02.613
It doesn't matter where he came from.

23:02.613 --> 23:04.893
We really are turning into a nasty
little country.

23:04.893 --> 23:07.493
- And isn't it time...
- Did he really just say that?

23:07.493 --> 23:10.173
..we had an immigration policy that
wasn't just crass xenophobia?

23:10.173 --> 23:13.373
You know, the world is full of
decent honest people

23:13.385 --> 23:15.502
just like you and me,
who want nothing more

23:15.513 --> 23:17.374
than to make a decent
life for themselves.

23:17.385 --> 23:18.933
Why can't we just admit that?

23:18.933 --> 23:21.693
Now, I've been arguing for some time

23:21.693 --> 23:24.396
that we need to fulfil our obligations,
and I'm not just talking...

23:24.407 --> 23:27.236
- Was that about your brother?
- Yes.

23:27.493 --> 23:30.813
I don't understand.

23:30.813 --> 23:34.013
They kill my brother
and then they put me in prison.

23:34.013 --> 23:37.373
It's not prison. Believe me,
prison's better than this.

23:37.373 --> 23:39.293
In prison you know when you're
going to get out.

23:39.293 --> 23:42.333
..ashamed of how few refugees we let
into this country

23:42.333 --> 23:45.893
and how badly we treated them,
when they were here.

24:23.093 --> 24:26.253
Sandrine, where are you going?
Can I give you a lift?

24:43.773 --> 24:45.773
How did you know where I was?

24:45.773 --> 24:47.493
I spoke to your mother.

24:50.493 --> 24:53.213
She and I talk most days
since your father died.

24:54.533 --> 24:57.373
She told me where you were having lunch,

24:57.373 --> 24:59.213
asked me to keep an eye out for you.

25:10.253 --> 25:11.853
Peter, I'm not feeling great.

25:11.853 --> 25:13.333
Can we stop and talk?

25:14.893 --> 25:16.573
Yeah, sure.

25:21.813 --> 25:24.973
Congratulations. You've really
pushed the envelope this time.

25:24.973 --> 25:27.053
- Meaning?
- Deborah's off the scale.

25:27.053 --> 25:28.373
Like I gave a damn.

25:28.373 --> 25:30.133
- That interview.
- What about it?

25:30.133 --> 25:33.078
I don't think she cared for you calling
Britain "a nasty little country."

25:33.089 --> 25:35.053
Oh, God, did I say that?

25:35.064 --> 25:38.236
First thing tomorrow she's insisting
on a meeting. No excuses.

25:38.251 --> 25:39.287
When?

25:39.298 --> 25:41.093
- 5.30.
- 5.30?

25:41.093 --> 25:42.493
Is she out of her mind?

25:42.493 --> 25:45.133
No, out of her bath at five
and prepped like an animal.

25:45.133 --> 25:48.133
She's going to eat four men stronger
than you before breakfast.

25:48.133 --> 25:50.489
Oh, and there's more bad news
from the grumpy French girl.

25:50.500 --> 25:53.813
Karen still isn't up, and Genevieve
doesn't know what to do.

25:53.813 --> 25:56.093
Right, that's it.
This time I'm going round.

25:56.093 --> 25:58.053
I'm going to sort this out,
once and for all.

25:58.053 --> 26:00.333
Are you sure? Isn't that what she wants?

26:14.733 --> 26:16.853
All right, tell me, is she still
in the bedroom?

26:16.853 --> 26:18.973
She's not going to see you,
she's shut herself in.

26:18.973 --> 26:21.653
Will you do me a favour and take
those fucking buds out your ears!?

26:23.093 --> 26:26.573
Er, just so you know, there's
something else she's not telling you.

26:26.573 --> 26:28.653
- What?
- About the pizza.

26:28.653 --> 26:30.733
What do I need to know about the pizza?

26:32.533 --> 26:36.213
Karen! Karen!

26:38.973 --> 26:41.573
Oh, hi. David. I didn't know
you were coming round.

26:41.573 --> 26:44.493
I wasn't. But Genevieve called me
and said that you weren't getting up

26:44.493 --> 26:46.693
and the baby needed to go to the
hospital.

26:46.693 --> 26:49.573
I don't know what she's talking about.
The baby's fine. She's sleeping.

26:49.573 --> 26:51.330
So she hasn't got a
doctor's appointment?

26:51.341 --> 26:52.925
I cancelled it. Come and have a drink.

26:52.936 --> 26:54.053
I don't want a drink!

26:54.053 --> 26:57.013
And now she's telling me stuff
that I-I just can't believe.

26:57.013 --> 26:59.053
Oh, yeah, what sort of stuff is that?

26:59.053 --> 27:00.813
About your pizza.

27:01.853 --> 27:04.613
- What about my pizza?
- And what comes with it!

27:04.613 --> 27:06.893
Oh, Christ, is that what this is about?

27:06.893 --> 27:09.973
What-what's wrong with drifting off
at the end of the day?

27:09.973 --> 27:12.173
What, you're upset
because I smoked a bit of weed?

27:12.173 --> 27:15.173
You like to stay stressed
in the evenings, don't you?

27:15.173 --> 27:19.373
Talking politics with your friends
in M&S suits?!

27:19.373 --> 27:22.173
I don't mind that you ordered dope
with your pizza, Karen.

27:22.173 --> 27:25.196
What I do mind is if you fail to
mention the fact to the police!

27:25.207 --> 27:26.548
Why? Why should I mention it?

27:26.559 --> 27:29.318
Because I'm in the Shadow Cabinet,
that's why!

27:29.329 --> 27:31.013
The police coming round
here to bust you!

27:31.013 --> 27:32.954
Right, so this isn't about me

27:32.965 --> 27:35.388
- this is about you!
- No, it isn't.

27:35.399 --> 27:37.985
It's about honesty and
it is about principle!

27:37.996 --> 27:39.751
Oh, principle. Principle, you mean like

27:39.762 --> 27:41.591
when you decided to fuck my best friend?

27:41.602 --> 27:44.943
- That kind of principle?
- After I'd left you, Karen. After!

27:44.954 --> 27:48.599
- Yeah, you left it a full three weeks!
- You were a fling,

27:48.610 --> 27:50.093
she was a fling, so what?

27:50.093 --> 27:52.213
Yes, but I was a fling
with a child, remember?

27:52.213 --> 27:53.373
Who you never see!

27:55.173 --> 27:56.933
No, Genevieve, you need to hear this,

27:56.933 --> 27:58.893
cos she knows bloody well what this
is about.

27:58.893 --> 28:01.253
You lost your job
and you didn't tell me.

28:01.253 --> 28:02.929
Well, why should I tell you?
Your words...

28:02.940 --> 28:05.784
I was a fling so what
business is it of yours?

28:06.773 --> 28:10.173
You-you don't even try to understand me.

28:10.173 --> 28:12.533
You don't know what it is I go through!

28:12.533 --> 28:14.573
What is it that you go through?

28:14.573 --> 28:16.373
No, really, I'm asking.

28:16.373 --> 28:19.333
Because a lot of people grow up in a
war zone, a lot of people grow up

28:19.333 --> 28:21.213
under fire, they lose their family,

28:21.213 --> 28:22.955
they inherit a lot of
money which they try

28:22.966 --> 28:25.162
their very best to get
through as fast as they can,

28:25.173 --> 28:27.119
but they don't all deliberately fuck up

28:27.130 --> 28:29.448
every situation that they walk into!

28:31.293 --> 28:35.373
You're both heartless, the two of you.

28:35.384 --> 28:37.024
You're loveless.

28:37.035 --> 28:40.693
If you just stood by me, if
you just gave me some trust!

28:40.693 --> 28:42.493
You're an addict, Karen.

28:42.493 --> 28:44.733
You're an addict!

28:44.733 --> 28:46.973
I know that, David.

28:46.973 --> 28:49.613
And it's all some crazy revenge on me.

28:49.613 --> 28:50.956
You throw away your job...

28:50.967 --> 28:52.996
I was working in a shop,
it's not so wonderful!

28:53.007 --> 28:56.120
You throw away your life,
because you're so furious

28:56.131 --> 28:57.707
that I don't love you.

28:57.853 --> 28:59.373
But I don't love you.

29:02.053 --> 29:03.493
I know that, too.

29:06.693 --> 29:08.093
I'm going to take Elfie away.

29:08.093 --> 29:10.093
If this happens again. I mean it.

29:10.093 --> 29:12.653
Oh, yeah? Take her away.
Take her away to what?

29:12.653 --> 29:16.293
You know, I keep reading
that you're a socialist, David.

29:16.293 --> 29:17.853
So it says in the paper.

29:17.853 --> 29:20.453
Aren't socialists meant to care
about other people?

29:20.453 --> 29:21.933
Aren't they meant to be committed?

29:21.933 --> 29:25.893
The only thing you're committed to
is ducking and diving,

29:25.893 --> 29:27.573
never answering your phone,

29:27.573 --> 29:28.893
lying about where you are.

29:28.893 --> 29:30.493
You know, if you have a spare moment,

29:30.493 --> 29:32.127
I might introduce you to your daughter!

29:32.138 --> 29:33.174
Three times

29:33.185 --> 29:35.202
you said you'd take her to see
Beauty And The Beast at the cinema.

29:35.213 --> 29:37.653
Three times you've cancelled. When
are you going to take her, David?

29:37.664 --> 29:40.290
Next year? The year after? Fuck!

29:43.813 --> 29:47.613
Well, you handled that brilliantly.

29:47.613 --> 29:49.293
Thank you.

29:57.493 --> 29:59.133
- I've been calling you.
- I know.

29:59.133 --> 30:01.106
- I've been calling you over and over.
- Sandrine,

30:01.117 --> 30:02.294
we had to be careful.

30:02.305 --> 30:05.773
- So what's the answer?
- The answer is yes.

30:05.773 --> 30:07.093
Thank God.

30:07.093 --> 30:09.173
I needed to be sure.

30:09.173 --> 30:11.253
Asif pretended to be an asylum seeker.

30:11.253 --> 30:13.533
He said he was Syrian. He wasn't.

30:13.533 --> 30:16.813
You wanted to kill a terrorist
and you did.

30:16.813 --> 30:18.373
- Are you sure?
- Certain.

30:19.733 --> 30:21.373
Do you feel better?

30:22.493 --> 30:24.053
No!

30:26.573 --> 30:29.093
Peter, sometimes I'm frightened.

30:29.093 --> 30:32.493
It's just so obvious.
They're trying to kill us,

30:32.493 --> 30:34.613
they're trying to take everything
from us.

30:34.613 --> 30:36.693
It's a way of life they want to destroy.

30:36.693 --> 30:39.053
I'm beginning to think
they've already destroyed it.

30:39.053 --> 30:41.813
I look around, and everyone's
carrying on as normal,

30:41.813 --> 30:43.533
but this isn't normal.

30:43.533 --> 30:45.613
Is that what's upsetting you?

30:45.613 --> 30:48.293
I'm trying to convince them
I need to go back.

30:48.293 --> 30:50.933
I need to fight. But I'm not succeeding.

30:56.133 --> 30:59.653
Your father was my best friend.

30:59.653 --> 31:01.253
We went everywhere together.

31:01.253 --> 31:04.053
- You know that.
- He said you saved his life.

31:04.053 --> 31:07.013
Yeah, I did. In a street fight
in Londonderry.

31:07.013 --> 31:08.933
He was a wonderful man.

31:10.344 --> 31:12.753
But at a certain point,
even to him, I said,

31:12.764 --> 31:14.730
"Ralph, you have to let go.

31:14.917 --> 31:16.013
"It's just a job."

31:17.408 --> 31:19.048
I don't think I could do anything else.

31:19.059 --> 31:20.627
You might have to.

31:21.573 --> 31:23.693
I'm saying that for your own good.

31:30.813 --> 31:33.613
There's a man at work
who's obsessing on me.

31:33.613 --> 31:35.453
Has he hurt you?

31:35.453 --> 31:38.453
No, he's low-level.
He's low-level sexual scum.

31:38.453 --> 31:40.173
If you need help, you let me know.

31:40.173 --> 31:42.133
- No, I can handle him.
- Good.

31:42.133 --> 31:45.293
Because I'm ready to kill anyone
who harms you

31:45.293 --> 31:46.533
or your mother.

31:48.133 --> 31:49.413
Thanks, Peter.

32:28.493 --> 32:30.333
I think we're done with you, Linh.

32:30.333 --> 32:31.973
Thank you very much. Are you OK?

32:31.973 --> 32:35.333
Yeah. Funny, actually - I feel
pretty good.

32:35.333 --> 32:37.733
No reason you shouldn't.
You can go home now.

32:44.973 --> 32:46.413
Here.

32:48.493 --> 32:53.133
Well, I don't think we can put
this out, do you?

32:53.133 --> 32:55.853
It's all a bit Crimewatch?

32:55.853 --> 32:57.933
Do you know where Kip's gone?

32:57.933 --> 32:59.853
No. She didn't say.

33:01.733 --> 33:04.013
Nathan, someone called Sam Spence
phoned.

33:04.013 --> 33:05.493
Can you call him back?

33:46.013 --> 33:48.053
Sam.

33:48.053 --> 33:49.413
Berna.

33:50.773 --> 33:52.773
You always said, didn't you?

33:52.784 --> 33:55.101
You always promised when
it got to the point

33:55.112 --> 33:58.242
where my life was in
danger, you'd take me out.

33:59.933 --> 34:02.213
The second murder's a fuck-up.

34:03.973 --> 34:05.733
Who did it?

34:05.733 --> 34:07.533
Who do you think?

34:10.013 --> 34:11.973
Your childhood friends?

34:14.172 --> 34:16.893
Don't get me wrong, they're butchers,

34:16.893 --> 34:20.172
but we grew up together
and that's why they trust me.

34:20.172 --> 34:22.733
We had the same childhood in Kirikkale.

34:22.733 --> 34:26.132
- Never been.
- Worst place on Earth.

34:26.132 --> 34:28.333
We all came to England together.

34:29.533 --> 34:33.533
Every morning we wake up and we're
not in Turkey, we're happy.

34:35.373 --> 34:38.693
Face it, we made mistakes, you and me.

34:40.773 --> 34:42.493
You know what I'm talking about.

34:44.013 --> 34:46.773
- Bari.
- Yes, Bari.

34:46.773 --> 34:48.493
Bari wasn't a mistake.

34:48.493 --> 34:50.092
I had no choice.

34:50.092 --> 34:52.333
The Italian police had names.

34:52.333 --> 34:54.572
They were going to send you to jail!

34:54.572 --> 34:56.132
I can't allow that.

34:58.653 --> 35:01.453
You and I have put five years into this.

35:02.733 --> 35:04.493
Westbourne's on to me.

35:04.493 --> 35:07.173
He called a meeting,
which he never does.

35:07.173 --> 35:09.373
And every time, he brings up Bari.

35:09.373 --> 35:10.773
How did I get the tip-off?

35:10.773 --> 35:12.373
Well, did you tell him the story?

35:12.373 --> 35:14.253
Yes. But he doesn't believe me.

35:15.733 --> 35:18.293
- You're a good actress.
- Not good enough.

35:20.133 --> 35:21.893
Do you know who did the pizza guy?

35:22.933 --> 35:25.893
Westbourne's like you -
strictly need-to-know.

35:25.893 --> 35:28.573
Gives nothing away.

35:28.573 --> 35:30.973
Clearly, it's going to depend
on the police.

35:30.973 --> 35:32.213
Are they anywhere near?

35:33.213 --> 35:35.573
Not last night they weren't.

35:35.573 --> 35:37.413
Who's the investigating officer?

35:38.453 --> 35:40.293
Kip Glaspie.

35:40.293 --> 35:41.933
Used to be a teacher.

35:42.933 --> 35:45.333
Her husband's head of a primary school.

35:47.053 --> 35:49.253
Typical new intake.

35:49.253 --> 35:52.293
Feeling sorry for the people
they're meant to police.

35:52.293 --> 35:54.013
Who's her boss?

35:54.013 --> 35:57.413
Jack Haley. PR man.

35:57.413 --> 35:59.493
It's not his fault.

35:59.915 --> 36:01.782
That's the job nowadays.

36:02.375 --> 36:06.413
They're in the perception
business, like everyone else.

36:06.413 --> 36:09.733
But if they get close...

36:09.733 --> 36:12.133
That's what I need, Sam.

36:12.133 --> 36:14.853
I need police progress monitored.

36:14.853 --> 36:16.311
- Sure.
- Closely.

36:16.322 --> 36:17.339
Sure.

36:17.350 --> 36:19.573
So that I know when
the net's drawing in.

36:19.573 --> 36:21.973
And I need you to tell me as soon
as you know.

36:21.973 --> 36:24.333
- It's going to save my life.
- Just...

36:24.333 --> 36:26.213
trust me.

37:14.493 --> 37:15.853
Sandrine?

37:41.253 --> 37:42.693
You're back!

37:44.933 --> 37:46.293
I'm expecting the bishop.

37:48.693 --> 37:50.333
How did it go?

37:50.333 --> 37:53.293
- Fine.
- What, you helped them?

37:53.293 --> 37:54.933
Yeah.

37:57.893 --> 37:59.533
I'm...

37:59.533 --> 38:02.053
going to speak to David again.

38:02.053 --> 38:03.413
Don't speak to David.

38:03.413 --> 38:05.293
- Why not?
- I don't want it.

38:05.293 --> 38:07.813
But it was you who asked me
to speak to him!

38:07.813 --> 38:11.733
In your country everything's a deal,
who you know,

38:11.733 --> 38:13.133
what they can do for you.

38:14.493 --> 38:15.993
I'm not a beggar.

38:16.004 --> 38:18.532
It isn't begging, Linh,
it's using the system.

38:18.758 --> 38:20.973
What, you want to fix things
with your old boyfriend?

38:20.973 --> 38:22.413
He wasn't my boyfriend!

38:23.653 --> 38:27.733
We were on some committee together,
we had some late nights - red wine,

38:27.733 --> 38:31.053
too much self-pity,
but from both of us. That's all.

38:32.213 --> 38:33.373
He's a mess.

38:35.253 --> 38:36.893
It wasn't love.

38:40.853 --> 38:42.933
I'd rather go home.

38:42.933 --> 38:44.613
I want to be legal.

38:46.613 --> 38:48.173
Am I allowed to say this?

38:49.213 --> 38:51.013
I'd like you to stay.

38:52.613 --> 38:55.613
That's the bishop.

38:55.613 --> 38:57.813
- I'll get it.
- It's better you don't.

38:57.813 --> 38:59.693
No, Jane, it's better I do.

39:04.853 --> 39:06.573
- Bishop.
- Yes.

39:06.573 --> 39:09.133
- I'm Linh.
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Linh.

39:09.133 --> 39:10.933
I've heard a lot about you.

39:10.933 --> 39:12.453
Come in.

39:16.693 --> 39:19.493
Hello, Rufus. I've just made tea.

39:25.453 --> 39:27.453
I'll be upstairs.

39:27.453 --> 39:29.173
I hope I'll see you again.

39:35.293 --> 39:37.373
You'd better get on with it, then.

39:37.373 --> 39:41.053
Jane, you know what the issue is.

39:41.053 --> 39:43.613
I wrote you a formal letter, remember?

39:43.613 --> 39:45.597
- I answered it.
- I know you did.

39:45.608 --> 39:47.566
Your letter's on file. I have it.

39:47.853 --> 39:50.453
So tell me, what's changed?

39:50.453 --> 39:52.893
I'll tell you what's changed.

39:54.093 --> 39:57.693
The woman you live with has been
found with Class A drugs,

39:57.693 --> 40:00.773
on a pavement, in the middle
of the night.

40:00.773 --> 40:04.133
And it appears she's overstaying
in the UK without permission.

40:05.293 --> 40:07.733
I'm a good priest, Rufus.

40:07.733 --> 40:09.053
I know you are.

40:10.053 --> 40:11.973
- Pastorally.
- I know what I'm doing.

40:13.013 --> 40:14.813
I help people. I'm valuable.

40:16.253 --> 40:19.453
As for the rest of it, the private
stuff is unimportant.

40:19.453 --> 40:21.173
- It's private.
- You can say that,

40:21.173 --> 40:23.253
it's me who has to deal
with the parishioners.

40:23.253 --> 40:24.613
There are rules.

40:24.613 --> 40:25.973
And if you enforce those rules,

40:25.973 --> 40:28.733
can you honestly say this parish
will be better off?

40:28.733 --> 40:30.933
Yeah, but that isn't the point.

40:30.933 --> 40:34.893
Look, when we discussed this a few
months ago, you made me a promise.

40:34.893 --> 40:37.013
It was a promise

40:37.013 --> 40:40.813
that you wouldn't draw attention
to your arrangements.

40:40.813 --> 40:42.893
You'd keep things low-key.

40:42.893 --> 40:46.413
And now, Linh's in newspapers
all over the parish.

40:46.413 --> 40:48.333
Low-key? I don't think so.

40:48.333 --> 40:50.933
Our church is thriving here.

40:50.933 --> 40:52.573
We're serving the poor.

40:52.573 --> 40:56.173
We-we're doing what Christ wanted us to.

40:57.733 --> 41:00.333
Does it really matter
if I sleep with a woman?

41:00.333 --> 41:02.693
It matters if you're seen
to sleep with a woman!

41:04.013 --> 41:05.453
We had a deal, Jane.

41:06.493 --> 41:08.013
Did we?

41:08.013 --> 41:09.573
You know we did.

41:10.693 --> 41:14.813
You'll find it in Paul's Letter
to the Ephesians, or somewhere,

41:14.813 --> 41:16.733
I don't care where.

41:16.733 --> 41:21.013
"Do what you like, but for goodness'
sake, keep it to yourself."

41:21.013 --> 41:24.130
- Ah.
- As far as I'm concerned,

41:24.141 --> 41:25.748
that's Gospel.

41:30.613 --> 41:33.013
I live with a man. You know that.

41:33.013 --> 41:34.253
I do.

41:36.053 --> 41:38.213
He's my...

41:38.213 --> 41:39.853
companion.

41:39.853 --> 41:41.693
Yes.

41:41.693 --> 41:45.533
When he comes to church,
John stands at the back.

41:45.533 --> 41:48.533
We can sleep in the same bed,
church doesn't mind,

41:48.533 --> 41:52.173
just as long as we don't touch
genitals, nobody objects.

41:55.653 --> 41:57.093
That's the rule.

41:59.333 --> 42:02.373
Now, you can call it hypocrisy,

42:02.373 --> 42:04.293
I call it sensitivity.

42:04.293 --> 42:06.590
Rufus, people no longer
believe in institutions

42:06.601 --> 42:09.348
and it's for exactly the
reasons you're giving me.

42:09.613 --> 42:11.693
Everything's fudge and falsity.

42:11.693 --> 42:14.453
Do you know, Jane, I believe
the opposite.

42:14.453 --> 42:16.718
It's only what you
call fudge and falsity

42:16.729 --> 42:18.522
which is holding things together at all.

42:18.533 --> 42:23.053
I can't have a priest who openly
sleeps with a girlfriend

42:23.053 --> 42:27.493
who's an illegal immigrant and who's
found stoned in the street.

42:28.893 --> 42:31.093
I can't have that.

42:32.773 --> 42:35.333
So what do you want me to do?

43:11.853 --> 43:13.333
You're alone this time.

43:13.333 --> 43:14.893
Yes.

43:14.893 --> 43:17.253
The men are not with you.

43:17.253 --> 43:19.213
No.

43:19.213 --> 43:21.533
Is there a reason for that?

43:28.973 --> 43:31.093
I made a friend here called Gillian.

43:32.293 --> 43:33.853
I told her your name.

43:33.853 --> 43:36.493
She said Kip Glaspie, great athlete.

43:37.533 --> 43:38.733
I wouldn't say great.

43:39.853 --> 43:42.493
On television, you fall on your back
and bounce.

43:45.733 --> 43:48.253
It's famous footage.

43:48.253 --> 43:50.373
Because it's painful to watch.

43:50.373 --> 43:52.093
You hurt when you see it.

43:53.933 --> 43:55.813
Look, I'll show you. It's on my phone.

43:59.173 --> 44:02.013
And here comes Great Britain's
Kip Glaspie for the pole vault.

44:02.013 --> 44:04.613
- Is that you?
- It certainly is.

44:04.613 --> 44:07.093
And here she comes for the approach...

44:07.093 --> 44:12.133
and... No she's down! Oh, my God!
She is down! That has got to hurt!

44:12.133 --> 44:13.853
I think she might have bounced.

44:13.853 --> 44:16.133
- It's very funny.
- I know.

44:17.653 --> 44:19.013
Why have it on your phone?

44:21.053 --> 44:25.333
Because, I don't know, it'll always
be something that happened to me.

44:25.333 --> 44:27.453
What about you?

44:27.453 --> 44:29.373
I'm not famous for anything.

44:29.373 --> 44:32.733
No, I mean, what did you do, before?

44:34.013 --> 44:36.693
I wanted to study at Baghdad University.

44:36.693 --> 44:38.213
Agronomy.

44:38.213 --> 44:39.533
Make the desert fertile.

44:41.093 --> 44:42.373
That was the plan.

44:43.773 --> 44:45.133
But that wasn't possible.

44:46.773 --> 44:48.773
Obviously, the Americans came in.

44:54.893 --> 44:58.133
Gillian's lived here her whole life.

44:58.133 --> 44:59.813
Now they're throwing her out.

45:01.253 --> 45:03.573
She has no rights without papers.

45:03.573 --> 45:07.453
- 30 years count for nothing.
- It happens.

45:08.653 --> 45:10.613
It's always the same.

45:10.613 --> 45:13.293
People get picked up when they make
a mistake.

45:14.653 --> 45:16.373
What have you come to ask me today?

45:19.653 --> 45:22.173
I need those names.

45:22.173 --> 45:24.293
What are you offering me in return?

45:24.293 --> 45:26.441
Fatima, it must have occurred to you,

45:26.452 --> 45:28.322
that even if you do get out of here,

45:28.333 --> 45:31.133
there's no question of you
being able to stay in the UK,

45:31.133 --> 45:33.253
because until we find your brother's
killer,

45:33.253 --> 45:34.893
you're never going to be safe.

45:34.893 --> 45:36.893
I know that.

45:37.088 --> 45:38.135
So?

45:38.588 --> 45:41.853
That's what Abdullah said when we
got here, the very same thing.

45:41.853 --> 45:43.253
We can never be safe.

45:44.453 --> 45:46.813
Abdullah said that the smugglers
were bound to find us.

45:46.813 --> 45:48.413
Because you knew who they were?

45:49.933 --> 45:51.733
Abdullah knew who the boss was.

45:53.213 --> 45:54.693
He wanted to make a deal.

45:55.893 --> 45:57.573
What was he? Crazy?

45:57.573 --> 45:58.813
No.

45:58.813 --> 46:00.693
Desperate.

46:03.373 --> 46:05.533
Mona's pregnant, did you guess?

46:05.533 --> 46:07.413
I thought she might be.

46:07.413 --> 46:08.933
Yeah.

46:10.293 --> 46:12.093
- How many months?
- Eight.

46:12.093 --> 46:13.493
And you?

46:15.133 --> 46:16.493
Just six.

46:18.853 --> 46:20.413
Mona was raped.

46:21.733 --> 46:24.093
She was raped in Baghdad.

46:24.093 --> 46:25.693
It's a disgrace for our family.

46:25.693 --> 46:27.013
We had to leave.

46:28.013 --> 46:30.533
We cannot go back, whatever happens.

46:32.573 --> 46:35.453
I told Abdullah. I told him over
and over,

46:35.453 --> 46:38.493
"England is a big country,
we can get lost."

46:38.493 --> 46:40.213
He said, "They'll find us."

46:40.213 --> 46:43.453
Did he find him? Did he find the boss?

46:43.453 --> 46:45.733
Fatima, you're being offered a chance.

46:45.733 --> 46:47.373
Take it.

46:47.373 --> 46:49.493
There's no tape. There's no recording.

46:49.493 --> 46:51.053
This meeting never happened.

46:52.653 --> 46:54.693
Are you offering me residence?

46:54.693 --> 46:56.413
And for Mona?

46:57.733 --> 47:01.293
- You have to trust me.
- How can I trust you?

47:01.293 --> 47:03.693
- Do you have power?
- No.

47:03.693 --> 47:05.613
- Then...
- But I know people who do.

47:06.933 --> 47:09.973
You have to trust the kind of person
I am.

47:09.973 --> 47:12.933
That's what it comes down to -
you have to look at me.

47:15.253 --> 47:16.973
It comes down to people.

47:28.973 --> 47:30.533
Good.

47:31.853 --> 47:33.613
Then we're making a deal.

47:33.613 --> 47:35.053
Nathan, we've got an address,

47:35.053 --> 47:36.933
I've texted you, The Newbury Hotel.

47:36.933 --> 47:40.373
I need uniformed officers, a
warrant, the whole fucking thing.

47:40.373 --> 47:41.813
I'll tell you later.

47:46.933 --> 47:50.333
You're not going to like this.
She's rung again.

47:50.333 --> 47:51.893
- Deborah?
- No.

47:51.893 --> 47:54.413
The au pair. She says
Karen never came back.

47:54.413 --> 47:56.573
Do you have any idea where she is?

47:59.173 --> 48:00.573
Yeah.

48:00.573 --> 48:02.453
I can make a pretty good guess.

48:30.733 --> 48:34.493
- How did you find me?
- Well, it's not the first time, is it?

48:34.493 --> 48:36.853
Look, I'm-I'm on a roll, OK,
don't spoil it.

48:36.853 --> 48:37.893
I've had a great night.

48:39.533 --> 48:43.373
David, I am on an incredible streak.

48:43.373 --> 48:44.773
This is... this is happening,

48:44.773 --> 48:48.333
OK, this, this is my chance
to put things right.

48:48.333 --> 48:50.173
- Where did you get it?
- What?

48:50.173 --> 48:51.893
- The money.
- I'm winning.

48:51.893 --> 48:54.493
I know that. But where did you get
the original stake?

48:54.493 --> 48:57.813
You've been broke for months!
I had to pay off gangsters.

48:57.813 --> 49:00.539
- Russians!
- David, finally something goes right!

49:00.550 --> 49:03.573
It goes right! Now just
let me have this spin.

49:03.573 --> 49:05.502
A man gets shot on your doorstep

49:05.513 --> 49:07.643
and all of a sudden
you've got loads of cash?

49:07.654 --> 49:10.093
And we're supposed to believe that
that's just coincidence, are we?

49:10.093 --> 49:12.573
Do you really think that has
something to do with me?

49:12.573 --> 49:14.784
- Where did you get it?
-  It's none of your business.

49:14.795 --> 49:15.948
Where did you get it?

49:15.959 --> 49:17.493
- Come on.
- No, get off.

49:17.493 --> 49:19.413
- We're leaving! We are leaving!
- No, get off!

49:19.413 --> 49:21.493
- We are le...
- Just let go!

49:21.493 --> 49:23.573
- Stop!
- Karen...

49:23.573 --> 49:25.653
Fuck! Get off of me!

49:25.653 --> 49:27.053
- Get off!
- We are leaving.

49:27.053 --> 49:28.093
Get off!

49:28.093 --> 49:30.973
Stop! Both leave now. Cash your chips.

49:43.533 --> 49:45.253
- Kip, all right?
- Yeah.

49:45.253 --> 49:47.093
- We're all briefed?
- Yeah.

49:47.093 --> 49:48.133
Right, here we go.

50:04.853 --> 50:06.493
Yes, please, how can I help?

50:06.493 --> 50:08.653
We're looking to interview
some of your employees.

50:08.653 --> 50:12.093
I don't think that's going to be
possible.

50:12.093 --> 50:14.973
OK. Well, then, we'll go out and
come back in through the front.

50:14.973 --> 50:17.213
Loudly. Lots of glasses knocked over.

50:21.613 --> 50:23.413
I hope you have authorisation.

50:23.413 --> 50:26.613
- Who's got the warrant?
- Let's go.

50:26.613 --> 50:29.453
You had someone working here
called Fatima Asif.

50:31.373 --> 50:33.013
Everyone here is freelance.

50:33.013 --> 50:35.933
Don't bullshit me, you know who
I'm talking about. She has a locker.

50:37.213 --> 50:39.933
I can't open it for you
if that's what you want.

50:39.933 --> 50:42.173
OK, just to be clear,
we're going to charge you,

50:42.173 --> 50:43.773
for employing illegal immigrants.

50:43.773 --> 50:45.933
We don't do any such thing.

50:45.933 --> 50:48.453
No? We'll start interviews.

50:48.453 --> 50:51.013
In an hour you may find
you have no staff at all.

50:51.013 --> 50:53.373
You'll be cleaning the fucking
toilets on your own.

51:13.973 --> 51:16.253
What is this? Cleaning materials?

51:16.253 --> 51:18.493
They provide their own.

51:18.493 --> 51:20.933
- Out of their wages?
- They're self-employed.

51:20.933 --> 51:22.933
They don't have to work here.

51:22.933 --> 51:24.653
Get the fuck out.

51:34.649 --> 51:36.168
Fatima's phone.

51:45.363 --> 51:46.682
Do you want a lift?

51:46.683 --> 51:48.943
- She had that all along?
- Yeah, but she'd hidden it.

51:48.954 --> 51:51.719
- Yeah, I know she'd hidden it.
- She didn't want to have it on her.

51:51.720 --> 51:53.398
- Yeah, I know that.
- Too big a risk.

51:53.399 --> 51:55.968
Kip, you may be a flyer but I'm not
as stupid as you think I am.

51:55.979 --> 51:58.192
- I don't think you're stupid.
- You went down to Harlsfleet

51:58.203 --> 52:00.045
without me.
You made her a promise, didn't you?

52:00.056 --> 52:02.111
- I went down to talk to her.
- I know how you did this.

52:02.122 --> 52:04.331
- Come on, Nathan.
- I know what you did. Fuck you, Kip.

52:04.342 --> 52:06.582
Fuck you and your methods.
This is how it is with you.

52:06.593 --> 52:08.506
It's always on your own terms
and fuck everyone else.

52:08.517 --> 52:10.671
- Nathan!
- No, fuck you, Kip! Fuck you!

52:45.134 --> 52:48.011
Kip, I found you.
I've been trying all day.

52:48.012 --> 52:49.850
Yeah, I'm not going to make it.

52:49.851 --> 52:52.609
I need to work. I need to think
and to work.

52:52.610 --> 52:54.488
Oh, that's the third night in a row!

52:54.489 --> 52:56.087
I know. I'm sorry.

52:56.088 --> 52:58.526
Are you all right? I'm worried.
Is something upsetting you?

52:58.527 --> 53:00.885
I promise it's fine.
I'd say if it wasn't.

53:00.886 --> 53:02.125
I know, I know you would.

53:03.924 --> 53:05.684
Look after yourself.

53:19.277 --> 53:20.996
Where is your money?

53:24.314 --> 53:27.313
Hello.

53:33.030 --> 53:37.268
No, no, no - 3,000 euro each. 3,000
for you and 3,000 for your wife.

53:42.545 --> 53:44.784
They're now on the boat.
