00:10.310 --> 00:12.740
<b>Ah, this is the foundation I wanted!</b>

00:12.740 --> 00:15.620
<b>I also want this lipstick and manicure spray.</b>

00:15.620 --> 00:17.740
<b>Oh, what a cute wig...</b>

00:17.740 --> 00:21.050
<b>Boss, we should get going soon.</b>

00:21.050 --> 00:22.550
<b>Just a little longer.</b>

00:23.000 --> 00:24.750
<b>I should buy this camisole too.</b>

00:26.810 --> 00:29.590
<b>Her shopping's gonna be the death of me.</b>

00:29.590 --> 00:30.930
<b>I concur.</b>

01:52.000 --> 01:57.050
<b>A x Brutal x Battlefield</b>

02:00.620 --> 02:02.850
<b>Was there anything else we needed?</b>

02:02.850 --> 02:05.060
<b>Did you want anything, Eliza?</b>

02:05.330 --> 02:07.440
<b>No, nothing at all.</b>

02:12.400 --> 02:13.570
<b>I have to go to the restroom.</b>

02:14.390 --> 02:15.790
<b>It's okay...</b>

02:15.790 --> 02:17.570
<b>Watch my stuff for me.</b>

02:20.280 --> 02:23.850
<b>Will Kurapika be okay?</b>

02:23.850 --> 02:28.830
<b>I used my flute to help him recover a little.</b>

02:29.790 --> 02:32.960
<b>How do you feel about the 
whole assassins business?</b>

02:33.610 --> 02:36.960
<b><i>The Ten Dons are hiring professionals 
to handle the Troupe.</i></b>

02:36.960 --> 02:38.220
<b><i>Professionals?</i></b>

02:38.900 --> 02:39.720
<b><i>So, Kurapika...</i></b>

02:40.090 --> 02:42.810
<b><i>I want you to join those hit men.</i></b>

02:44.560 --> 02:46.710
<b>Judging by his heartbeat,</b>

02:46.710 --> 02:51.720
<b>he wasn't entirely pleased 
about joining the hit men.</b>

02:52.260 --> 02:53.510
<b>Of course not.</b>

02:53.510 --> 02:57.800
<b>However, Kurapika is extremely determined.</b>

02:58.630 --> 03:05.120
<b>To achieve his goal, he's certainly 
willing to sacrifice everything.</b>

03:05.120 --> 03:07.120
<b>That's a hard road...</b>

03:07.830 --> 03:09.590
<b>I couldn't do it.</b>

03:09.590 --> 03:12.620
<b>What's the point of a life in which 
you're basically killing yourself?</b>

03:13.150 --> 03:15.410
<b>She's taking a long time.</b>

03:17.080 --> 03:18.780
<b>Once we finish this job,</b>

03:18.780 --> 03:21.990
<b>I'm using the money to see 
the world on my bike.</b>

03:21.990 --> 03:23.890
<b>That sounds really nice.</b>

03:24.340 --> 03:27.160
<b>Not enjoying yourself is a crime.</b>

03:27.160 --> 03:29.020
<b>There are many ways to spend a life.</b>

03:29.020 --> 03:32.650
<b>Everyone has different ideas 
about what's important.</b>

03:35.270 --> 03:36.060
<b>Huh?</b>

03:36.550 --> 03:37.900
<b>What's wrong?</b>

03:38.330 --> 03:39.900
<b>She's gone!</b>

03:39.900 --> 03:40.550
<b>Huh?</b>

03:40.550 --> 03:41.650
<b>What?!</b>

03:42.610 --> 03:43.910
<b><i>Daddy's such a liar!</i></b>

03:45.120 --> 03:49.240
<b><i>He wasn't going to take me to the auction!</i></b>

03:49.610 --> 03:51.610
<b><i>Fine, I'll just go by myself!</i></b>

04:02.530 --> 04:03.760
<b>Come in.</b>

04:09.260 --> 04:12.040
<b>Forever Active</b>

04:10.180 --> 04:14.270
<b>One, two, three, four, five, six...</b>

04:15.460 --> 04:17.530
<b>Looks like everyone's here.</b>

04:17.530 --> 04:18.650
<b>No, not yet.</b>

04:19.910 --> 04:22.280
<b>I thought the team only had eight members.</b>

04:22.280 --> 04:25.810
<b>Nostrade is sending an additional person.</b>

04:25.810 --> 04:29.790
<b>Tsk, the guy who uses that 
voodoo fortunetelling?</b>

04:43.450 --> 04:46.300
<b>Then, has everyone arrived?</b>

04:47.320 --> 04:50.060
<b>The job is to annihilate the Phantom Troupe.</b>

04:50.420 --> 04:52.560
<b>When the auction kicks off again,</b>

04:52.560 --> 04:55.060
<b>they may show up.</b>

04:55.060 --> 04:57.560
<b>If they do, dispose of them.</b>

04:57.560 --> 04:59.710
<b>You're free to use any means you want.</b>

05:00.890 --> 05:03.570
<b>This team will be after the same target.</b>

05:04.160 --> 05:06.800
<b>We should decide how we address 
each other when communicating.</b>

05:06.800 --> 05:08.280
<b>Just use colors.</b>

05:08.280 --> 05:10.080
<b>Call me Blue.</b>

05:10.650 --> 05:12.080
<b>I'll be Red.</b>

05:12.760 --> 05:14.580
<b>It's like playing a game.</b>

05:15.010 --> 05:16.730
<b>Eh? What about you guys?</b>

05:16.730 --> 05:17.820
<b>Silva.</b>

05:17.820 --> 05:18.850
<b>I'm Zeno.</b>

05:18.850 --> 05:21.180
<b>Zeno? What color is that?</b>

05:21.180 --> 05:24.230
<b>We will both use our real names.</b>

05:24.230 --> 05:25.340
<b>What?</b>

05:26.090 --> 05:28.240
<b>You're welcome to call me by name,</b>

05:28.240 --> 05:29.710
<b>but I won't take orders.</b>

05:30.240 --> 05:32.350
<b>We'll do this our own way.</b>

05:32.730 --> 05:34.860
<b>Silva and Zeno...</b>

05:34.860 --> 05:36.850
<b>Of the Zoldyck family?</b>

05:38.510 --> 05:41.360
<b>Let me know if you want someone killed.</b>

05:41.360 --> 05:45.610
<b>I'm willing to give you a thirty percent 
discount for being in the same line of work.</b>

05:49.040 --> 05:51.530
<b><i>They're from Killua's family.</i></b>

05:52.120 --> 05:53.620
<b>Does it really matter</b>

05:54.290 --> 05:55.700
<b>what we call one another?</b>

05:55.700 --> 05:57.110
<b>Agreed.</b>

05:57.110 --> 06:00.250
<b>There's no requirement we work together.</b>

06:00.610 --> 06:02.710
<b>But we're talking about the Troupe.</b>

06:02.710 --> 06:04.740
<b>Attacking alone will be dangerous.</b>

06:06.770 --> 06:07.920
<b>And you?</b>

06:07.920 --> 06:10.920
<b>Shaky teamwork will only cause confusion.</b>

06:10.920 --> 06:12.700
<b>I will move alone.</b>

06:14.080 --> 06:15.540
<b>So it's 5 to 4.</b>

06:15.540 --> 06:16.770
<b>We have our answer.</b>

06:17.200 --> 06:21.310
<b>The auction begins at nine. 
We will transport you to the auction hall.</b>

06:22.330 --> 06:24.030
<b>Please wait here until it's time.</b>

06:26.630 --> 06:28.430
<b>Yo, Nostrade...</b>

06:29.150 --> 06:31.040
<b>How are you feeling?</b>

06:31.040 --> 06:32.310
<b>Not too bad.</b>

06:32.740 --> 06:34.450
<b>Not too bad?</b>

06:34.450 --> 06:36.160
<b>You've gotten pretty full of yourself.</b>

06:36.860 --> 06:40.320
<b>Not too long ago, you were just 
leading a little country gang,</b>

06:40.320 --> 06:43.670
<b>and now you're acting like my equal.</b>

06:44.030 --> 06:47.850
<b>I hear you've been rubbing your hands 
together so much, your skin rubbed off.</b>

06:47.850 --> 06:49.150
<b>You okay?</b>

06:52.140 --> 06:54.680
<b>It's sad when a man shows jealousy.</b>

06:56.500 --> 06:57.310
<b>Bastard!</b>

07:00.300 --> 07:02.550
<b>What's this about?</b>

07:02.550 --> 07:04.820
<b>Go ahead and stick that knife in me!</b>

07:05.140 --> 07:06.570
<b>Kurapika, that's enough!</b>

07:09.760 --> 07:14.090
<b>Let's be clear... 
No one's impressed by you!</b>

07:18.620 --> 07:20.780
<b>Many people envy my success,</b>

07:20.780 --> 07:23.390
<b>while they ignore their own failings.</b>

07:24.300 --> 07:27.090
<b>However, I intend to continue to rise.</b>

07:27.090 --> 07:29.180
<b>By using Neon's fortunetelling.</b>

07:30.200 --> 07:32.250
<b>I expect great things from you.</b>

07:32.750 --> 07:35.210
<b>You will be appropriately rewarded 
when the time comes.</b>

07:35.910 --> 07:36.750
<b>Yes.</b>

07:43.500 --> 07:45.860
<b>The police are cooperating?</b>

07:46.430 --> 07:48.560
<b>Sixty percent of the votes</b>

07:48.560 --> 07:51.270
<b>in the Yorknew City mayoral 
election were bought.</b>

07:51.750 --> 07:54.870
<b>And the police chief is the mayor's protégé.</b>

07:55.300 --> 07:57.800
<b>Redirecting traffic is quite easy for us.</b>

08:01.520 --> 08:02.300
<b>Hello?</b>

08:02.300 --> 08:03.830
<b>Kurapika, it's terrible.</b>

08:03.830 --> 08:05.150
<b>The boss ran away!</b>

08:06.160 --> 08:08.360
<b>She changed clothes in the restroom,</b>

08:08.360 --> 08:10.380
<b>so she must have planned ahead.</b>

08:10.880 --> 08:13.320
<b>Then I can guess where she's going.</b>

08:13.860 --> 08:15.890
<b>Return to the hotel and stand by.</b>

08:16.820 --> 08:17.990
<b>What's wrong?</b>

08:17.990 --> 08:20.030
<b>Your daughter's run away.</b>

08:20.030 --> 08:20.910
<b>What?!</b>

08:22.230 --> 08:24.400
<b>We probably have the same destination.</b>

08:25.010 --> 08:26.320
<b>The auction?</b>

08:30.220 --> 08:32.660
<b>Damn, she's turned off her phone.</b>

08:32.660 --> 08:35.710
<b>But Neon doesn't have a pass...</b>

08:35.710 --> 08:38.410
<b>She'll be turned away at the gate.</b>

08:39.180 --> 08:40.870
<b>This is Light Nostrade!</b>

08:40.870 --> 08:43.660
<b>I need you to convey an order 
to all the guards at the gate!</b>

08:44.160 --> 08:47.180
<b>If a girl about seventeen or 
eighteen arrives with no pass,</b>

08:47.180 --> 08:49.410
<b>they should take her into custody!</b>

08:49.410 --> 08:50.670
<b>Her description...</b>

08:53.410 --> 08:56.180
<b>Okay, please go ahead.</b>

08:58.300 --> 08:59.180
<b>Whew,</b>

08:59.180 --> 09:01.840
<b>I was stuck without a way 
to get past that gate.</b>

09:01.840 --> 09:03.430
<b>Thank you so much.</b>

09:04.220 --> 09:05.850
<b>You're very welcome.</b>

09:08.340 --> 09:10.440
<b>Really?! When was that?</b>

09:10.440 --> 09:12.460
<b>About five minutes ago...</b>

09:12.460 --> 09:16.690
<b>Her hair and attire were slightly 
different, but it was probably her.</b>

09:16.690 --> 09:18.860
<b>She didn't have a pass?</b>

09:18.860 --> 09:22.830
<b>She didn't appear to realize that 
the auction required a pass.</b>

09:23.180 --> 09:27.580
<b>She mentioned something about 
her daddy, but then she left.</b>

09:28.480 --> 09:31.090
<b>Yes, she got in a taxi alone.</b>

09:31.510 --> 09:33.590
<b>Yes, goodbye.</b>

09:34.510 --> 09:36.090
<b>Nice work.</b>

09:37.750 --> 09:39.710
<b>Neon, where have you gone?</b>

09:39.710 --> 09:41.420
<b>I'll search for her.</b>

09:43.870 --> 09:46.350
<b>Do you have a map of the city?</b>

09:52.860 --> 09:54.810
<b>I've heard that you're a good fortuneteller.</b>

09:54.810 --> 09:55.770
<b>Huh?</b>

09:55.770 --> 09:57.630
<b>Someone once mentioned it to me.</b>

09:58.620 --> 10:00.370
<b>I can't remember who...</b>

10:00.670 --> 10:01.780
<b>I'm good.</b>

10:01.780 --> 10:03.780
<b>Important people request 
my services all the time.</b>

10:04.690 --> 10:06.110
<b>What's your accuracy?</b>

10:06.110 --> 10:08.250
<b>They say I'm always right.</b>

10:08.250 --> 10:10.080
<b>They say?</b>

10:10.080 --> 10:11.630
<b>Aren't you the one telling the fortunes?</b>

10:11.630 --> 10:13.510
<b>My hand moves on its own.</b>

10:13.510 --> 10:15.380
<b>Oh, how impressive.</b>

10:15.380 --> 10:17.180
<b>Would you tell me mine?</b>

10:17.180 --> 10:18.050
<b>Sure.</b>

10:18.050 --> 10:22.390
<b>Write your full name, date of birth, 
and blood type on a sheet of paper.</b>

10:27.130 --> 10:28.310
<b>Will this work?</b>

10:29.020 --> 10:30.400
<b>Let me see.</b>

10:30.890 --> 10:33.360
<b>Chrollo Lucilfer...</b>

10:33.360 --> 10:34.800
<b>That's a strange name.</b>

10:34.800 --> 10:37.320
<b>My friends call me "boss."</b>

10:38.400 --> 10:39.150
<b>What?</b>

10:39.150 --> 10:40.600
<b>That's even stranger!</b>

10:41.880 --> 10:43.910
<b>Then, I'll tell your fortune.</b>

10:58.390 --> 11:02.930
<b>Your daughter is already in the 
Cemetery Building on the auction site.</b>

11:03.300 --> 11:05.490
<b>What? But how?!</b>

11:05.490 --> 11:07.930
<b>Regardless, we should hurry.</b>

11:14.480 --> 11:15.940
<b>Okay, all done.</b>

11:16.240 --> 11:17.360
<b>May I have a look?</b>

11:17.820 --> 11:18.810
<b>Sure.</b>

11:20.590 --> 11:22.760
<b>My fortunes are a little strange.</b>

11:22.760 --> 11:25.540
<b>They usually have four or five verses.</b>

11:25.900 --> 11:29.700
<b>Each one corresponds to 
a week of the month,</b>

11:29.700 --> 11:32.380
<b>so the first may have already happened.</b>

11:33.510 --> 11:34.800
<b>Oh...</b>

11:40.390 --> 11:42.860
<b><i>The calendar loses a precious component.</i></b>

11:43.710 --> 11:46.780
<b><i>The remaining months gather to mourn.</i></b>

11:48.020 --> 11:50.670
<b><i>The mourners play a melody,</i></b>

11:51.540 --> 11:55.730
<b><i>while the eleventh moon quietly rises.</i></b>

12:17.270 --> 12:18.550
<b>Amazing.</b>

12:18.870 --> 12:19.990
<b>It's correct.</b>

12:22.210 --> 12:24.090
<b>About this first verse...</b>

12:24.090 --> 12:25.060
<b>Huh?</b>

12:25.060 --> 12:26.250
<b>Oh, stop...</b>

12:26.250 --> 12:29.060
<b>I never look at the fortunes I write.</b>

12:29.530 --> 12:30.660
<b>Why not?</b>

12:30.660 --> 12:34.240
<b>I have a feeling they're more accurate 
if I stay away from them.</b>

12:34.930 --> 12:37.110
<b>Then may I ask you a question?</b>

12:37.610 --> 12:38.570
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

12:38.940 --> 12:43.320
<b>This verse refers to a requiem for the dead.</b>

12:44.370 --> 12:46.820
<b>Do you believe in the afterlife?</b>

12:47.220 --> 12:48.640
<b>Hmm...</b>

12:48.640 --> 12:50.830
<b>Not really.</b>

12:51.530 --> 12:54.960
<b>My fortunes are for people who are alive.</b>

12:54.960 --> 12:57.050
<b>Like you, Chrollo-san.</b>

12:58.180 --> 13:00.740
<b>I'm guessing that the requiem</b>

13:00.740 --> 13:04.550
<b>is meant to help you, not the dead.</b>

13:08.110 --> 13:10.100
<b>You're probably right.</b>

13:11.150 --> 13:12.460
<b>Let's go.</b>

13:12.460 --> 13:14.590
<b>They'll let us start browsing 
at the auction soon.</b>

13:16.350 --> 13:18.860
<b>Actually, I heard that from someone else.</b>

13:19.230 --> 13:20.240
<b>Eh?</b>

13:20.240 --> 13:23.610
<b>When I was little, I saw a 
fortuneteller on TV say that.</b>

13:24.230 --> 13:29.190
<b>That fortunes were meant to 
make the living happy.</b>

13:29.780 --> 13:30.870
<b>Really?</b>

13:31.840 --> 13:36.860
<b>So the fortuneteller tried to 
avoid giving negative fortunes.</b>

13:36.860 --> 13:38.130
<b>Negative fortunes?</b>

13:38.510 --> 13:39.670
<b>The idea was</b>

13:39.670 --> 13:43.900
<b>to encourage people to wish for and 
work toward better things.</b>

13:44.410 --> 13:49.140
<b>At the time, I was really moved...</b>

13:49.660 --> 13:52.730
<b>From then on, I wanted to be a fortuneteller.</b>

13:59.210 --> 14:01.590
<b><i>The calendar loses a precious component.</i></b>

14:02.440 --> 14:05.650
<b><i>The remaining months gather to mourn.</i></b>

14:06.900 --> 14:09.910
<b><i>The mourners play a melody,</i></b>

14:09.910 --> 14:12.800
<b><i>while the eleventh moon quietly rises.</i></b>

14:14.530 --> 14:16.800
<b><i>The chrysanthemum withers and falls,</i></b>

14:17.430 --> 14:20.230
<b><i>to lie on the ground beside bloody Scarlet Eyes.</i></b>

14:20.930 --> 14:23.330
<b><i>But you will remain supreme.</i></b>

14:24.630 --> 14:27.460
<b><i>Even after losing half your limbs.</i></b>

14:28.470 --> 14:30.270
<b><i>Enjoy the interlude.</i></b>

14:31.000 --> 14:33.290
<b><i>Search out new allies.</i></b>

14:33.920 --> 14:35.830
<b><i>East is the direction to go.</i></b>

14:35.830 --> 14:38.620
<b><i>You will find one who awaits you.</i></b>

14:40.430 --> 14:45.190
<b>A few years later, that fortuneteller 
was arrested for being a con artist.</b>

14:45.510 --> 14:47.690
<b>Are you talking about the Galactic Grandma?</b>

14:47.690 --> 14:48.930
<b>Yep!</b>

14:48.930 --> 14:52.560
<b>I remember that she didn't 
believe in the afterlife.</b>

14:52.560 --> 14:56.450
<b>Right, so that's why I don't, either.</b>

14:58.520 --> 15:01.640
<b>Personally, I believe in ghosts.</b>

15:01.640 --> 15:02.460
<b>Huh?</b>

15:02.890 --> 15:08.570
<b>And that's why I'll do as he 
would have wanted.</b>

15:08.570 --> 15:09.720
<b>What do you mean?</b>

15:12.870 --> 15:14.430
<b>Go wild.</b>

15:19.030 --> 15:19.850
<b>Are you okay?</b>

15:21.510 --> 15:23.150
<b>Call a doctor!</b>

15:24.280 --> 15:26.860
<b>We're on the first floor, 
by the north elevator.</b>

15:27.320 --> 15:29.610
<b>Someone's ill. Call an ambulance.</b>

15:29.610 --> 15:30.640
<b>We can't.</b>

15:30.640 --> 15:35.490
<b>They won't let an ambulance 
inside without a pass.</b>

15:35.850 --> 15:36.880
<b>What did you say?</b>

15:36.880 --> 15:39.160
<b>What if the unthinkable happens?!</b>

15:39.440 --> 15:41.850
<b>This is the daughter of the 
Nostrade Family boss!</b>

15:41.850 --> 15:44.170
<b>Will you take responsibility for her life?!</b>

15:44.170 --> 15:46.200
<b>Tsk, got it.</b>

15:46.200 --> 15:48.550
<b>She has fans among the Ten Dons.</b>

15:48.550 --> 15:50.530
<b>Fine, we'll make it happen.</b>

15:50.530 --> 15:52.340
<b>Hey, call for an ambulance!</b>

15:52.340 --> 15:53.290
<b>Got it.</b>

15:53.720 --> 15:57.580
<b>Are you able to rewind this monitor?</b>

15:57.820 --> 15:59.420
<b>Huh? Yeah.</b>

16:08.040 --> 16:10.610
<b><i>That chop was incredibly fast...</i></b>

16:10.610 --> 16:12.700
<b><i>Only I could have caught it.</i></b>

16:13.290 --> 16:15.450
<b><i>It's been a while since I was this excited.</i></b>

16:16.700 --> 16:18.450
<b><i>There is my prey.</i></b>

16:19.350 --> 16:21.720
<b>Nostrade-sama, your daughter is</b>

16:21.720 --> 16:24.710
<b>resting in room 501, on the fifth floor.</b>

16:29.440 --> 16:32.220
<b>She shouldn't have been able to secure a pass...</b>

16:32.570 --> 16:34.090
<b>How did she get in?</b>

16:37.710 --> 16:41.330
<b>Your daughter's picture is on the Hunter website.</b>

16:41.330 --> 16:42.290
<b>What?</b>

16:42.980 --> 16:46.650
<b>Most likely, someone found 
this picture on the site,</b>

16:46.650 --> 16:49.900
<b>approached her, and then brought her here.</b>

16:51.860 --> 16:54.020
<b>I'll find that person and kill him!</b>

16:54.020 --> 16:55.240
<b>Please remain calm.</b>

16:55.800 --> 16:59.490
<b>I don't believe capturing your 
daughter was their objective.</b>

16:59.490 --> 17:04.210
<b>She may have been a hostage in case they 
had trouble infiltrating the building.</b>

17:05.250 --> 17:07.160
<b>It's dangerous here.</b>

17:07.160 --> 17:09.220
<b>I called Melody and Basho.</b>

17:09.220 --> 17:10.800
<b>They should arrive soon.</b>

17:10.800 --> 17:13.010
<b>Can I trust them?</b>

17:13.010 --> 17:15.300
<b>You should go with them.</b>

17:15.300 --> 17:17.280
<b>But the auction...</b>

17:17.280 --> 17:18.360
<b>There won't be one.</b>

17:19.290 --> 17:21.010
<b>This place will become a battlefield.</b>

17:21.650 --> 17:23.880
<b>The auction will be postponed again.</b>

17:30.490 --> 17:32.230
<b><i>A trail of blood.</i></b>

17:33.190 --> 17:34.890
<b><i>He wants to be found...</i></b>

17:35.280 --> 17:38.030
<b><i>By leaving a scent that only another killer</i></b>

17:38.610 --> 17:39.990
<b><i>would catch.</i></b>

17:41.290 --> 17:43.470
<b><i>You are just like me.</i></b>

17:44.210 --> 17:45.790
<b><i>We are the same.</i></b>

17:47.550 --> 17:49.800
<b><i>Addicted to murder.</i></b>

17:52.730 --> 17:54.200
<b>Relax.</b>

17:54.850 --> 17:57.040
<b>I won't use any cheap tricks.</b>

18:01.190 --> 18:02.810
<b>Let's play one-on-one.</b>

18:05.160 --> 18:06.260
<b>Yeah.</b>

18:07.580 --> 18:09.310
<b>I have a message from the boss.</b>

18:09.310 --> 18:12.570
<b>He wants to go wild in the Cemetery 
Building, so we should come.</b>

18:14.490 --> 18:17.260
<b>We aren't too far away.</b>

18:18.190 --> 18:19.680
<b>What about everyone else?</b>

18:19.680 --> 18:21.860
<b>The rest had the same idea.</b>

18:21.860 --> 18:24.700
<b>They've been cleaning up the trash, 
while approaching the building.</b>

18:25.040 --> 18:26.800
<b>Okay, then let's go.</b>

18:26.800 --> 18:31.050
<b>Also, the boss actually added a rule this time.</b>

18:31.050 --> 18:32.710
<b>A rule? What?</b>

18:33.740 --> 18:34.930
<b>Go absolutely crazy.</b>

18:59.150 --> 19:02.030
<b><i>The calendar loses a precious component.</i></b>

19:02.980 --> 19:06.280
<b><i>The remaining months gather to mourn.</i></b>

19:08.290 --> 19:10.850
<b><i>The mourners play a melody,</i></b>

19:11.790 --> 19:15.800
<b><i>while the eleventh moon quietly rises.</i></b>

19:18.170 --> 19:20.630
<b><i>The chrysanthemum withers and falls,</i></b>

19:21.780 --> 19:25.120
<b><i>to lie on the ground beside bloody Scarlet Eyes.</i></b>

19:26.100 --> 19:29.100
<b><i>But you will remain supreme.</i></b>

19:30.680 --> 19:33.610
<b><i>Even after losing half your limbs.</i></b>

19:35.800 --> 19:37.610
<b><i>Enjoy the interlude.</i></b>

19:39.160 --> 19:41.710
<b><i>Search out new allies.</i></b>

<b><i>East is the direction to go.</i></b>

19:45.240 --> 19:48.870
<b><i>You will find one who awaits you.</i></b>

19:59.010 --> 19:59.880
<b>Why?</b>

20:01.770 --> 20:02.890
<b>Why?</b>

20:05.240 --> 20:08.200
<b>Why am I still alive?</b>

20:10.720 --> 20:13.260
<b>This is known as an Indoor Fish.</b>

20:13.900 --> 20:17.120
<b>Made from <i>Nen</i>, it can only 
exist in enclosed spaces.</b>

20:17.630 --> 20:20.040
<b>It's a carnivore that enjoys human flesh.</b>

20:20.680 --> 20:23.540
<b>Its victims don't bleed or feel pain.</b>

20:24.670 --> 20:27.910
<b>And they won't die until the 
Indoor Fish disappears.</b>

20:29.800 --> 20:31.060
<b>Won't die...</b>

21:03.950 --> 21:06.300
<b><i>The calendar loses a precious component.</i></b>

21:07.630 --> 21:10.580

21:35.570 --> 21:38.030
<b><i>We are playing a requiem for you.</i></b>

21:41.770 --> 21:45.450
<b>It was the start of a stormy night,</b>

21:45.450 --> 21:49.730

23:12.830 --> 23:14.540
<b>An Enhancer.</b>

23:13.810 --> 23:16.310
<b>He's strong enough to punch through a body.</b>

23:14.540 --> 23:19.920
<b>The greater the windup,

23:16.310 --> 23:18.250
