[soulful music playing]

00:45.921 --> 00:47.923
[inaudible]

01:47.858 --> 01:49.860
[theme music playing]

02:54.424 --> 02:57.886
[sniffling]
Give me a minute, okay?

03:02.015 --> 03:03.100
Mrs. Urich?

03:05.227 --> 03:07.687
Um... I'm Karen.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.690
Karen Page.
I don't know if Ben ever--

03:10.774 --> 03:13.401
Karen, yes.

03:13.485 --> 03:15.445
He talked about you all the time.

03:16.739 --> 03:17.781
He did?

03:17.865 --> 03:19.950
He thought you were something else.

03:20.033 --> 03:24.454
The way you wouldn't let go
until you got to the truth.

03:24.537 --> 03:26.373
He admired that.

03:27.165 --> 03:29.584
We never got around to having kids,

03:29.667 --> 03:32.045
too busy with this or that, but...

03:32.129 --> 03:36.008
if we had, I think he would have
wanted one like you.

03:37.843 --> 03:39.720
[voice breaking] Mrs. Urich, I...

03:41.847 --> 03:43.348
I think it's my fault...

03:44.850 --> 03:45.976
what happened to Ben.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.145
I pushed him into a story
that he didn't want--

03:48.228 --> 03:53.233
Ben Urich never got pushed into doing
anything he didn't want to do.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.944
He was a reporter.

03:56.987 --> 03:58.947
That's what he lived for.

03:59.031 --> 04:02.284
[voice breaking]
And he passed doing what he loved...

04:03.493 --> 04:05.954
what he had to do.

04:06.038 --> 04:08.040
We should be getting back.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.420
It was nice to meet you, Karen.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.380
Is there...
Is there anything that you need?

04:15.463 --> 04:17.299
-Anything at all that I--
-No.

04:17.382 --> 04:20.010
Ben's taken care of all that.

04:23.221 --> 04:29.519
He took out a policy years back
when that river water story turned ugly.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.481
He always took care of me.

04:36.359 --> 04:37.485
[sobbing] Still is.

04:56.088 --> 04:57.505
[Lantom] How you holding up?

04:58.465 --> 05:00.550
Like a good Catholic boy.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.052
That bad, huh?

05:02.135 --> 05:03.804
He was a good man.

05:05.347 --> 05:06.849
And he's gone...

05:09.184 --> 05:11.769
because I haven't stopped
what's happening to this city.

05:11.854 --> 05:15.190
[Lantom] Can't put that
on yourself, Matthew.

05:15.273 --> 05:16.900
You've done everything you can.

05:18.776 --> 05:20.445
A lot you probably shouldn't have.

05:21.404 --> 05:22.990
And here we are.

05:47.890 --> 05:51.726
[Karen] He just stood there,
like he was his friend.

05:51.809 --> 05:53.728
Like he had nothing to do
with what happened.

05:53.811 --> 05:55.522
I thought Ben said
he didn't have any evidence

05:55.605 --> 05:57.232
Ellison was taking money from Fisk.

05:57.315 --> 06:00.652
No, but it makes sense.
I mean, it explains...

06:01.987 --> 06:03.071
[sighs]

06:05.823 --> 06:08.243
Do you know what makes this worse?

06:09.744 --> 06:10.913
Foggy.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.832
Didn't even show up.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.585
You said he left a message.

06:17.669 --> 06:20.380
Yeah, he left a message...

06:20.463 --> 06:23.466
saying he had something more important
to do than come to Ben's funeral.

06:23.550 --> 06:24.927
Come on, he wouldn't say that.

06:25.010 --> 06:28.096
-Yeah, well, it's what he meant.
-[Matt sighs]

06:29.181 --> 06:30.848
It's my fault, Karen...

06:32.184 --> 06:33.435
all of this with Foggy.

06:34.061 --> 06:37.147
No, everyone shares the blame
in a relationship.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.150
That's... just the way that it works.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.610
No, not always.

06:43.653 --> 06:46.406
Why don't you go home,
get some rest, huh?

06:47.615 --> 06:48.866
I can't.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.703
[Karen sighs]

06:52.787 --> 06:55.415
Every time I close my eyes, I see...

06:58.501 --> 07:00.878
What if he finds out that I...

07:05.258 --> 07:07.677
That I was with Ben...

07:07.760 --> 07:09.054
at Saint Benezet.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.973
What if he finds out
that I spoke to his mother too?

07:11.056 --> 07:14.017
If that happens, we will deal with it.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.185
How?

07:16.394 --> 07:18.771
I mean, the news barely mentioned
what happened to Ben

07:18.855 --> 07:21.858
because Fisk pays off the media.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.485
And the police
haven't arrested anyone for it

07:23.568 --> 07:26.321
because Fisk pays them off, too.

07:27.072 --> 07:28.573
Foggy was right.

07:28.656 --> 07:32.619
How do you stop someone like that,
someone who has so much?

07:32.702 --> 07:35.205
It just means he has more to lose.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.914
-He's gonna find out what I did.
-No.

07:36.999 --> 07:38.666
He's going to find out,
and he's gonna come after me

07:38.750 --> 07:40.002
just like he came after Ben.

07:40.085 --> 07:42.337
I told you I would keep you safe, Karen...

07:42.420 --> 07:44.922
when he came after you over Union Allied.
That hasn't changed.

07:46.758 --> 07:48.385
Everyone that's taken money from him,

07:48.468 --> 07:51.554
everyone that's helped him
tear this city apart...

07:53.765 --> 07:56.643
they're all gonna
get what's coming to them...

07:56.726 --> 07:58.228
along with Wilson Fisk.

08:10.573 --> 08:11.783
[Vanessa] Wilson?

08:13.701 --> 08:14.952
You should be in bed.

08:15.037 --> 08:16.871
I was calling for you.

08:18.206 --> 08:19.749
I'm sorry, I...

08:21.959 --> 08:23.170
I didn't hear you.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.088
[sighs]

08:28.716 --> 08:30.135
Anything interesting?

08:31.511 --> 08:33.013
Just a transfer of funds.

08:33.096 --> 08:37.309
Wesley made the arrangements
for me to get you out of the country.

08:37.392 --> 08:40.937
-You know I won't leave without you.
-I'm not asking.

08:43.856 --> 08:46.568
I'm just reviewing them,
and then I'll move the funds back.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.237
Is everything all right?

08:51.823 --> 08:53.658
It's just the numbers, I...

08:55.077 --> 08:57.704
I'll have Leland take a look at them...

08:59.081 --> 09:01.374
well, just to make sure.

09:11.968 --> 09:16.639
[Leland] Senator Cherryh's cleared
the last of the zoning hurdles...

09:18.183 --> 09:21.311
after squeezing us for another extra 10%.

09:21.394 --> 09:25.898
Bright side, you'll be able to build
whatever you want on your properties now.

09:25.982 --> 09:29.361
Everyone's been paid off,
everyone's on board.

09:29.444 --> 09:32.405
But we will need to find a replacement
for Gao's heroin trade.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.616
Without it,

09:34.699 --> 09:38.661
we might have some off-the-books
cash flow issues down the road.

09:40.913 --> 09:43.333
What's the word
on what happened with her?

09:43.416 --> 09:44.792
Looks like she's in the wind.

09:45.752 --> 09:50.673
Wouldn't have expected it, but maybe
she's not the ally we thought she was.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.093
Mmm, maybe she's not.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.932
What's this?

10:00.016 --> 10:04.521
I asked Wesley to transfer funds for me
the night before we found him.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.773
I thought financials was my job.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.733
Yes, that's why I wanted you
to have a look at these.

10:08.816 --> 10:12.320
There seem to be some irregularities
with my accounts.

10:13.655 --> 10:17.284
Of course there are.
I move money around all the time.

10:18.075 --> 10:22.038
It's a shell game to keep the SEC
off our backs, it's nothing.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.254
Your hand's shaking.

10:29.337 --> 10:32.799
[Leland scoffs]
'Cause it's freezing out here.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.218
Then why are you sweating, Leland?

10:39.013 --> 10:42.642
[sighs] All right, okay, Jesus.

10:44.186 --> 10:46.646
I figured you'd find out sooner or later.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.151
What's a guy gonna do?

10:51.234 --> 10:53.361
Wesley found out, didn't he?

10:54.946 --> 10:56.573
He confronted you...

10:57.657 --> 10:58.741
and you shot him.

10:58.825 --> 11:02.954
I have no idea what happened to Wesley.
I wasn't a part of that.

11:03.037 --> 11:06.166
But you had something to do
with the benefit, didn't you?

11:06.249 --> 11:07.250
You and Gao?

11:07.334 --> 11:10.712
She's gone, you're stealing from me.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.214
It's not what you think.

11:12.297 --> 11:13.965
You tried to kill me.

11:15.550 --> 11:16.759
[sighs]

11:19.346 --> 11:21.556
The poisonings at the benefit

11:21.639 --> 11:26.228
were just to make it look like
someone was trying to get at you.

11:26.311 --> 11:28.355
But you were never the target.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.275
[inhales sharply] Vanessa?

11:33.610 --> 11:34.777
Do you blame us?

11:36.153 --> 11:39.574
Just look at what's happened
since you took up with her.

11:39.657 --> 11:44.287
[sighs] You've been distracted,
emotional, erratic.

11:44.371 --> 11:47.290
We just wanted to nudge you back on track.

11:48.333 --> 11:49.626
But...

11:51.794 --> 11:55.047
obviously that went south, so...

11:55.965 --> 11:58.050
we will be parting ways...

11:59.677 --> 12:02.722
and I'll be taking
half your assets with me.

12:03.806 --> 12:07.226
[yelling] You think that I would let you
walk away after what you've done?

12:07.310 --> 12:10.272
That's exactly what you're gonna do,

12:10.355 --> 12:13.065
because I have Detective Hoffman.

12:13.775 --> 12:18.195
Hoffman never left the city after
he murdered his partner in the hospital.

12:18.280 --> 12:21.533
I scooped him up,
squirreled him away for a rainy day.

12:22.450 --> 12:25.328
If I don't check in every 24 hours...

12:26.413 --> 12:29.040
Hoffman gets dropped off to the Feds...

12:30.249 --> 12:32.419
tells them all the shit
he's been up to.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.086
Hoffman, he's...

12:35.463 --> 12:38.049
he's a frightened little worm.

12:38.132 --> 12:40.927
He would never risk going against me.

12:41.010 --> 12:43.430
Ten million buys a lot of courage.

12:45.222 --> 12:46.891
He thinks he's going into
witness protection,

12:46.974 --> 12:48.601
get the money on the other side.

12:48.685 --> 12:51.313
Now, I know you'll get to him
before he cashes in,

12:51.396 --> 12:54.774
but by then the damage
will already have been done...

12:55.525 --> 13:00.112
and everything you've been fighting
so hard for will come tumbling down.

13:00.196 --> 13:03.533
Yeah, but you would get
caught up in that as well.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.160
I've spent my entire life...

13:07.329 --> 13:10.498
hiding assets overseas
for pricks like you.

13:12.208 --> 13:16.379
My son and I will be
just another transaction,

13:16.463 --> 13:19.799
disappearing into the tax-exempt ether.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.427
But I'm a fair sort.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.847
That's why I'm only taking
half your money.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.434
You go your way, I go mine.

13:29.517 --> 13:32.019
Not what I'd call win-win...

13:32.937 --> 13:35.732
but it's as close as
we're gonna get with this.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.734
So...

13:39.318 --> 13:41.863
we on the same page?

13:41.946 --> 13:43.072
I, uh...

13:44.616 --> 13:46.283
No...

13:46.368 --> 13:47.910
I don't think we are.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.539
-[Taser buzzing]
-[screams]

13:54.459 --> 13:55.835
[groans]

13:57.795 --> 13:59.422
You hurt her!

13:59.506 --> 14:00.632
Wait, wait!

14:01.340 --> 14:03.385
You hurt Vanessa!

14:09.516 --> 14:11.518
[Fisk breathing heavily]

14:21.235 --> 14:23.571
Sweep the city.

14:23.655 --> 14:26.616
Find Hoffman and put a bullet in his head.

14:28.743 --> 14:30.327
[grunting]

14:47.595 --> 14:49.346
[panting]

14:53.601 --> 14:54.936
How'd you know I was here?

14:56.062 --> 14:58.064
Known about your outlet for a while.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.776
I didn't say anything because I thought
it had something to do with your dad.

15:01.859 --> 15:03.528
Now I know better.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.781
[grunting]

15:07.449 --> 15:10.827
Thought you'd be out punching people
in the head, or whatever you do.

15:12.328 --> 15:15.039
I was. Paid Ben's editor a visit.

15:15.122 --> 15:17.083
-Ellison?
-Yeah.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.293
Karen thinks he's working for Fisk.

15:19.376 --> 15:20.377
Did he talk?

15:20.462 --> 15:23.297
[panting] No, never got close.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.469
Wife and kid picked him up
outside the office.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.261
Try it again tomorrow night.

15:36.227 --> 15:39.897
Looking like you have some anger issues.
Wanna talk about it?

15:39.981 --> 15:42.108
You're not my priest, Foggy...

15:42.191 --> 15:45.445
who you might have met
if you'd shown up for Ben's funeral.

15:45.528 --> 15:46.988
Karen upset?

15:52.076 --> 15:54.829
I told her this was my fault...

15:54.912 --> 15:56.372
all of this between you and me.

15:59.291 --> 16:02.419
[sighs] I just nodded.

16:03.379 --> 16:04.589
You could tell that, right?

16:04.672 --> 16:06.508
Yeah, I could tell.

16:08.300 --> 16:12.514
I was on my way to the service
and I got a call...

16:12.597 --> 16:13.681
from Marci.

16:13.765 --> 16:14.807
From Marci?

16:14.891 --> 16:17.560
She's been helping me...

16:17.644 --> 16:20.354
copying files from Landman and Zack
on the quiet.

16:20.437 --> 16:23.024
Whole stack of documents
on their dealings with Fisk,

16:23.107 --> 16:25.151
-and Owlsley at Silver and Brent.
-[slams fist]

16:25.234 --> 16:28.195
Ben is dead, Foggy,
because he got dragged into this.

16:28.279 --> 16:29.697
And now you're doing the same
with your ex.

16:29.781 --> 16:32.074
-We're being careful.
-This has to stop.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.618
Fisk has to...

16:38.498 --> 16:39.666
I have to stop this...

16:41.584 --> 16:43.795
before there's no one left to bury.

16:43.878 --> 16:45.337
Matt...

16:45.421 --> 16:46.422
Matt!

16:47.549 --> 16:50.510
Last time you went after Fisk,
I found you half dead!

16:50.593 --> 16:51.886
More than half.

16:51.969 --> 16:56.015
You go after him in the mask again,
he might kill you.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.517
Or you might kill him,

16:57.600 --> 17:00.269
which would probably have the same effect
on someone as Catholic as you are.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.188
What am I supposed to do?

17:03.272 --> 17:04.524
How do I stop him?

17:04.607 --> 17:06.526
By using the law, Matt.

17:07.944 --> 17:11.113
Like you told me and Karen to do.
That's how we take him down.

17:12.615 --> 17:13.658
We?

17:15.702 --> 17:17.620
Thought Nelson and Murdock were over.

17:20.247 --> 17:25.377
There's nothing I want more than to
find a way back to where we were, but...

17:25.461 --> 17:27.964
[sighs]

17:28.047 --> 17:29.381
I don't know if we can.

17:30.341 --> 17:31.884
No, we can't.

17:34.053 --> 17:37.514
But maybe we can find a way
to move forward, Foggy.

17:41.435 --> 17:43.229
Things are bad enough around here.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.857
Last thing I need is to be seen
chumming it up with the enemy.

17:45.940 --> 17:47.734
Especially ones
bringing cigars for my mom.

17:47.817 --> 17:48.943
These are the good ones.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.695
So all the other times
you were buying cheap?

17:50.778 --> 17:52.572
How are things bad?
What's going on?

17:52.655 --> 17:54.991
You hear about that warehouse fire
a few days back?

17:55.074 --> 17:56.701
[Foggy] That Chinese place?
[Brett] Yeah, it turns out

17:56.784 --> 17:59.161
it was full of illegal immigrants
and a shit ton of heroin.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.537
And that guy in the mask was there.

18:00.622 --> 18:01.956
I had a run-in with him
leaving the scene.

18:02.039 --> 18:04.000
-What happened?
-I got my ass beat.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.961
But this guy, I mean, I don't know,
what he said, it got me thinking.

18:07.587 --> 18:10.506
-I heard he has that effect on people.
-He was working with Ben Urich.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.008
How do you know that?

18:12.091 --> 18:15.011
Because we were working with Ben, too,
on the same story.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.388
Where are you with the investigation?
Any leads?

18:17.471 --> 18:19.140
You know I can't be
talking to you about that.

18:19.223 --> 18:22.309
Story Ben was working on
was about Wilson Fisk.

18:22.393 --> 18:23.936
[Brett] Yeah, the man in the mask
talked about him.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.022
He said half the cops in the 15th
are in his pocket.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.106
You believe him?

18:27.189 --> 18:29.191
No, I've seen things make me wonder.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.152
Ben found Fisk's mom.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.070
Told him some things
Fisk wouldn't want out there.

18:33.154 --> 18:34.571
And you think he killed him for it?

18:34.656 --> 18:36.448
Does it match up
with anything you can't tell us?

18:36.532 --> 18:38.826
[Brett] No, no, forensics couldn't pull
a single print at the scene.

18:38.910 --> 18:40.119
Not even Urich's.

18:40.202 --> 18:43.039
All his files and notebooks are gone,
hard drives wiped clean.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.541
Fisk's mom got the same treatment.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.585
Gone, no record of her
at the care facility Ben found her at.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.090
Looking for you inside, Sarge.

18:53.174 --> 18:55.760
-Yeah, yeah, I'll be in in a minute.
-[officer] Yeah, I'm still here.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.344
Give me the rest of it.

18:58.930 --> 19:01.390
[Brett] I've been gone ten minutes
and already they're looking for me.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.185
[officer] Christ, I thought he was
at the bottom of the river.

19:04.268 --> 19:06.979
I'll reach out to the C.I.'s,
see if anybody's got a line.

19:07.063 --> 19:11.108
Owlsley has Hoffman stashed in the city.
We'll find the little rat shit.

19:11.192 --> 19:12.526
[Brett] Look, I gotta get back.

19:12.609 --> 19:15.362
-Nothing else you can give us?
-No, I've said too much already!

19:15.446 --> 19:17.156
And this guy isn't even listening.

19:17.239 --> 19:18.449
-Just standing there, man.
-I'm sorry.

19:18.532 --> 19:19.826
What were you saying?

19:19.909 --> 19:21.618
It don't matter.
The way things are going around here,

19:21.703 --> 19:23.746
I'm thinking about
taking an early pension.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.247
Move my mom somewhere warm.

19:25.331 --> 19:26.874
Be a shame.

19:26.958 --> 19:29.043
The only cop on the force
we know for sure is honest.

19:29.126 --> 19:31.128
Never see Serpico?

19:31.212 --> 19:35.049
Honest cops are usually the ones
get shot in the face.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.426
-Another dead end.
-No, it wasn't.

19:37.509 --> 19:39.929
The cop on the phone, I had
a run-in with him before in the mask.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.305
He works for Fisk?

19:41.388 --> 19:44.308
He was talking to someone about Hoffman.
They're looking for him.

19:44.391 --> 19:46.227
Detective Hoffman? He's alive?

19:46.310 --> 19:48.270
From what I could tell,
Owlsley has him holed up somewhere.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.606
Fisk wants him found, bad.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.359
Hell yeah, he does.
Hoffman could blow this thing wide open.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.569
Only if we get to him first.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.364
[Foggy sighs]

19:59.281 --> 20:02.659
You know what doesn't make you
want to gouge your eyes out?

20:02.744 --> 20:06.080
Cold cuts, Italian meats, cheeses.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.415
Why did I become a lawyer again?

20:08.499 --> 20:09.959
To make lots of money.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.210
[laughs]

20:11.836 --> 20:13.254
That didn't work out so good, did it?

20:13.337 --> 20:14.922
[chuckles] Not so much.

20:15.006 --> 20:16.758
Could have had my own deli,

20:16.841 --> 20:19.135
an apron with my name on it
and everything.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.888
-[Karen chuckles]
-What?

20:21.971 --> 20:25.391
Oh, it's just this.
It's the way it should be.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.684
What, Foggy talking about cured meats?

20:27.769 --> 20:30.437
[chuckles]
Nelson and Murdock.

20:31.731 --> 20:32.774
It's a start.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.568
Uh, you, uh, find anything?

20:37.111 --> 20:40.656
Well, there's thousands
and thousands of pages, I...

20:41.448 --> 20:44.201
How'd Marci even get this out of
Landman and Zack without anyone noticing?

20:44.285 --> 20:47.163
She can be very... distracting.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.165
-Hmm, I bet.
-[chuckles]

20:49.248 --> 20:51.500
Concentrate on anything
pertaining to Silver and Brent.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.377
Uh, liens, development, property holdings,

20:53.460 --> 20:55.797
anything that might point to where
Owlsley is holding Hoffman.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.715
The corruption, the bombings,
the cops that got shot,

20:58.800 --> 20:59.884
Hoffman knows it all.

20:59.967 --> 21:03.179
He turns, it won't just bring Fisk down.

21:03.262 --> 21:06.723
It'll prove your man in the mask
isn't the asshole everyone thinks he is.

21:06.808 --> 21:09.852
You really think he'll go against Fisk,
even if we find him?

21:09.936 --> 21:13.022
A lot of friction between Fisk and
the other players he's been working with.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.190
[inhales sharply]

21:14.273 --> 21:16.483
Bombed the hell out of the Russians,
the Yakuza went underground,

21:16.567 --> 21:19.611
Chinese heroin went up in flames.
Now Owlsley's making a move.

21:19.695 --> 21:21.613
You don't get to be the man on top

21:21.697 --> 21:25.076
without making enemies
looking to tear you down.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.413
It's just something Ben told me.

21:30.206 --> 21:31.874
He's right. You don't.

21:35.169 --> 21:38.339
So how'd you find out about Owlsley?
You never said.

21:38.422 --> 21:40.049
[Foggy stammers]

21:40.132 --> 21:42.343
Your... pal in the mask.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.720
You saw him?

21:44.804 --> 21:46.763
Oh, my God.
When? Where?

21:46.848 --> 21:50.351
[stammering]
You know the alley down by--

21:50.434 --> 21:51.643
-[Matt] At the alley by the, um...
-Yeah.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.312
...where we used to, um...

21:54.146 --> 21:55.772
All that matters is he...

21:55.857 --> 21:59.318
he really seems like
he's trying to do the right thing.

21:59.401 --> 22:03.030
-I told you I had a feeling about him.
-[Foggy chuckles]

22:03.114 --> 22:06.325
[sighs] It could take us a week
to sift through all this,

22:06.408 --> 22:08.035
and we have no idea
if these records are complete.

22:08.119 --> 22:09.620
Even if they are,
it doesn't mean that

22:09.703 --> 22:12.164
Owlsley's using company funds
to stash Hoffman.

22:12.248 --> 22:14.208
Owlsley's a man of financial privilege.

22:14.291 --> 22:16.793
I never met one that used his own money
when he could use someone else's.

22:16.878 --> 22:18.212
I'll call Marci,

22:18.295 --> 22:20.672
see if she found anything else
might help narrow the search.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.674
Wait, wait.

22:22.758 --> 22:26.762
All right, this is a rundown of all of
Silver and Brent's real estate holdings.

22:26.845 --> 22:29.974
There's 187 just spread out
across New York State.

22:30.057 --> 22:31.100
We already looked at that.

22:31.183 --> 22:36.313
Well, yeah, but the same rundown
dated for the next day, it lists only 186.

22:37.314 --> 22:40.317
Silver and Brent liquidate and acquire
new properties all the time.

22:40.401 --> 22:41.610
One of them probably
just sold that day.

22:41.693 --> 22:45.239
Well, I mean, that's what I thought,
but... look.

22:45.322 --> 22:48.700
Look at the balance after the property
disappears from the record.

22:50.244 --> 22:51.453
It hasn't changed.

22:51.537 --> 22:55.374
So, if it was sold, wouldn't that be
reflected in the profit-loss?

22:55.457 --> 22:56.792
Unless someone's trying
to hide the fact

22:56.875 --> 22:58.585
the property's been
taken off the records altogether.

22:58.669 --> 23:01.505
No shift in profit-loss,
maybe no one notices.

23:02.339 --> 23:03.757
Or it could just be a clerical error.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.384
-Where's the property?
-Uh...

23:05.467 --> 23:06.885
53rd and 10th.

23:06.969 --> 23:08.179
Hell's Kitchen.

23:09.430 --> 23:12.391
Right, stay here, keep looking through
the documents in case we're wrong.

23:12.474 --> 23:14.726
I'll go to the 15th
and tell Brett what we found.

23:14.810 --> 23:16.145
Couldn't you just call him?

23:16.228 --> 23:19.856
Fisk might be tapping the police lines
for all we know. Keep working.

23:22.568 --> 23:23.735
[Foggy] Hey, hey, hey.

23:25.196 --> 23:26.572
You're not going to the 15th, are you?

23:26.655 --> 23:30.076
I trust Brett, but he's just one cop.
He couldn't handle it alone.

23:30.159 --> 23:31.368
But you can?

23:31.452 --> 23:34.913
I know how you feel
about what I do, Foggy.

23:34.997 --> 23:38.792
This is the part
where law meets reality.

23:38.875 --> 23:42.546
Either I put on the mask
or we risk losing Hoffman and Fisk wins.

23:46.008 --> 23:47.301
[door closes]

23:56.602 --> 23:58.312
[cell phone ringing]

24:01.773 --> 24:02.774
Yes?

24:03.942 --> 24:05.277
Thank you.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.114
Send the closest team.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.699
No survivors.

24:23.962 --> 24:25.672
[thunder rumbling]

24:38.102 --> 24:41.813
[man 1] All right, all right.
We got subs from Marchioni's.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.274
[man 2] I thought it was pizza.

24:43.357 --> 24:45.901
[man 1] Eh, too hard to carry
with the boxes.

24:45.984 --> 24:48.987
There's a, uh, chicken parm...

24:49.071 --> 24:50.572
Give it here.

24:50.656 --> 24:52.699
-He call yet?
-No.

24:52.783 --> 24:54.535
Still got eight minutes.

24:54.618 --> 24:55.786
Owlsley don't call by then,

24:55.869 --> 24:56.912
-we can get out of this dump.
-Yeah.

24:56.995 --> 24:59.373
[Hoffman] I don't know,
it kinda grows on you.

24:59.456 --> 25:00.999
You got my meatball sub?

25:01.083 --> 25:02.334
[man 1] Yeah, uh...

25:03.335 --> 25:04.836
Here you go.

25:06.130 --> 25:07.756
-[gunshots]
-[grunts]

25:17.141 --> 25:19.351
[officer 1] All clear.
[officer 2] Check over there.

25:19.435 --> 25:20.852
[officer 1] Clear.

25:22.854 --> 25:24.440
Hey, Carl.

25:26.108 --> 25:28.444
Been wondering where you got to.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.242
-[gunshots]

25:43.250 --> 25:44.543

[Masked Man panting]

25:58.014 --> 26:00.016
[shuddering]

26:12.070 --> 26:14.990
You have an opportunity here, Detective.

26:16.242 --> 26:19.120
By turning evidence on Fisk,
you can set things right.

26:19.828 --> 26:22.038
If that's what you want.

26:22.123 --> 26:24.333
If not, you can sit here
playing with yourself

26:24.416 --> 26:27.043
until Fisk sends more men to kill you.

26:27.128 --> 26:28.879
[Hoffman whimpering]

26:30.881 --> 26:32.007
Decide.

26:33.217 --> 26:36.052
It won't make a difference.
He owns the cops.

26:36.137 --> 26:38.264
-I'll be dead before I can testify--
-Not all of them.

26:38.347 --> 26:41.683
Turn yourself in to Brett Mahoney,
you can trust him.

26:41.767 --> 26:44.770
And he knows a couple of lawyers
that can't be bought. They can help you.

26:44.853 --> 26:45.854
Yeah.

26:47.189 --> 26:48.482
Thanks for the tip.

26:53.820 --> 26:55.113
[panting]

26:56.157 --> 26:58.575
I'll be following you to make sure
you get to the precinct alive.

26:59.201 --> 27:02.704
Try to run, try to do anything
other than what I just told you,

27:02.788 --> 27:05.832
you'll wish I never saved you
from that bullet.

27:11.922 --> 27:14.007
[indistinct conversations]

27:39.074 --> 27:41.159
I need to make a statement.

27:46.122 --> 27:47.374
[Foggy] As we stated on the phone,

27:47.458 --> 27:49.835
our client is willing to be placed
in protective custody

27:49.918 --> 27:52.213
and waive all considerations for immunity.

27:52.296 --> 27:55.131
-In exchange for what?
-Nothing.

27:55.216 --> 27:58.885
Detective Hoffman regrets his involvement
in Wilson Fisk's criminal enterprise

27:58.969 --> 28:01.430
and seeks only to unburden himself

28:01.513 --> 28:03.890
in the eyes of God
and the state of New York.

28:04.933 --> 28:05.934
Detective?

28:06.935 --> 28:08.770
[sighs]

28:08.854 --> 28:12.148
I've taken money, a lot of money,
to do things for...

28:15.110 --> 28:16.194
For Fisk.

28:17.238 --> 28:18.364
I'm not the only one.

28:18.447 --> 28:22.409
There's cops, lawyers, judges...

28:22.493 --> 28:23.869
[laughs]

28:23.952 --> 28:26.037
...at least one senator I know of.

28:26.121 --> 28:30.751
Start from the beginning.
Names, dates, I want it all.

28:31.502 --> 28:32.628
[Karen chuckles]

28:32.711 --> 28:35.797
[Hoffman] My partner and I
were first approached

28:35.881 --> 28:39.718
by a man working for Wilson Fisk...

28:39.801 --> 28:41.387
18 months ago.

31:03.987 --> 31:05.614
[reporter1] Senator!
[reporter 2] Senator Cherryh!

31:05.697 --> 31:07.741
[reporter 1] Senator, how do you
respond to allegations

31:07.824 --> 31:09.660
that you accepted payoffs
from Wilson Fisk?

31:09.743 --> 31:11.244
[Cherryh] I have done
nothing wrong and neither...

31:11.327 --> 31:13.246
...no further comment.
Other prominent figures...

31:13.329 --> 31:16.625
...a temporary strike
when they walked out of their jobs...

31:16.708 --> 31:18.460
[Fisk] Make the arrangements.

31:19.503 --> 31:22.005
-Wait for my call.
-What they're saying on the news...

31:22.088 --> 31:23.590
They're coming for me, Vanessa.

31:23.674 --> 31:25.258
-So we have to leave now.
-It's too late.

31:25.341 --> 31:26.593
-There's nothing we can do--
-No!

31:26.677 --> 31:28.970
There's nothing that we can do
to keep this from happening. Nothing.

31:29.054 --> 31:30.180
[sighs]

31:31.139 --> 31:33.349
I need you to do something for me.

31:34.225 --> 31:35.769
Listen very carefully.

31:35.852 --> 31:38.354
[siren wailing]

31:39.022 --> 31:40.566
[indistinct chatter]

31:46.863 --> 31:49.324
Do you understand
everything I've told you?

31:49.408 --> 31:52.786
-[exhales] Yes.
-There's one more thing.

31:52.869 --> 31:54.746
-[banging on door]
-[man] Federal Agents!

31:54.830 --> 31:56.372
We have a warrant
for the arrest of Wilson Fisk.

31:56.457 --> 31:59.334
-I don't have a lot of time.
-[man] Open the door.

31:59.418 --> 32:01.002
[door breaking]

32:01.878 --> 32:04.798
Wilson Fisk, you're under arrest
for racketeering.

32:04.881 --> 32:06.967
-You have the right to remain silent.
-I want to ask you...

32:07.050 --> 32:09.219
Anything you say can be used against you
in a court of law.

32:09.302 --> 32:10.887
-Vanessa...
-You have the right to an attorney.

32:10.971 --> 32:12.639
-...you are my heart.
-If you cannot afford an attorney...

32:12.723 --> 32:14.057
-You're everything.
-...one will be provided to you.

32:14.140 --> 32:15.684
Do you understand these rights?

32:15.767 --> 32:17.561
[inaudible]

32:34.369 --> 32:35.787
[reporter 1] Mr. Fisk?
[reporter 2] Mr. Fisk?

32:35.871 --> 32:37.247
How do you respond
to the allegations

32:37.330 --> 32:39.332
that you were involved
with the Ranskahov brothers

32:39.415 --> 32:41.042
and that you were responsible
for the bombings?

32:41.126 --> 32:44.004
[reporter 1] Senator Cherryh has stated
that he will be exonerated by the facts.

32:44.087 --> 32:45.464
Do you feel the same?

32:45.547 --> 32:47.215
Mr. Fisk, what about
your better tomorrow?

32:47.298 --> 32:48.467
Mr. Fisk?

32:48.550 --> 32:50.844
[reporter 2] Any kind of statement?
Please, any statement whatsoever?

32:50.927 --> 32:53.764
[reporter 3] Mr. Fisk, can you tell us
what you know about the Russians?

32:56.975 --> 33:00.103
The man once hailed
as the savior of Hell's Kitchen

33:00.186 --> 33:01.938
is now believed
to have been involved...

33:02.022 --> 33:05.651
[Foggy] Now everybody knows
what kind of asshole Fisk really is.

33:05.734 --> 33:06.777
[Matt and Karen laughing]

33:06.860 --> 33:09.154
And we are the ones that made it happen,
the three of us.

33:09.237 --> 33:12.824
-And Marci.
-And Marci, God bless her designer pumps.

33:12.908 --> 33:14.576
Maybe she's not that bad after all.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.495
Woman does have a way
of growing on you.

33:16.578 --> 33:19.164
See, this right here...

33:19.247 --> 33:20.415
in this office.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.292
This is what's important.

33:22.375 --> 33:25.671
Knowing that the people
I care about are safe,

33:25.754 --> 33:28.507
and having some sense of closure
for the ones we've lost.

33:30.592 --> 33:31.718
For Elena.

33:33.970 --> 33:35.096
For Ben.

33:35.180 --> 33:39.100
And everyone else
that son of a bitch has hurt.

33:39.184 --> 33:40.226
[Foggy chuckles]

33:40.310 --> 33:41.645
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

33:42.813 --> 33:44.523
[sirens wailing]

33:52.698 --> 33:55.701
I was thinking
about a story from the Bible.

33:55.784 --> 33:57.202
Did I tell you to open your mouth?

33:57.285 --> 33:59.495
Let him talk.
Don't mean nothin'.

34:00.664 --> 34:03.542
I'm not a religious man...

34:03.625 --> 34:06.587
but I've read bits and pieces
over the years.

34:06.670 --> 34:08.589
Curiosity more than faith.

34:08.672 --> 34:10.799
But this one story...

34:11.842 --> 34:13.426
There was a man.

34:14.385 --> 34:17.889
He was traveling
from Jerusalem to Jericho...

34:19.099 --> 34:22.102
when he was set upon
by men of ill intent.

34:23.937 --> 34:27.440
They stripped the traveler
of his clothes, they beat him,

34:27.523 --> 34:30.611
and they left him
bleeding in the dirt.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.657
And a priest happened by...

34:38.159 --> 34:39.911
saw the traveler.

34:41.454 --> 34:44.708
But he moved to the other side of the road
and continued on.

34:44.791 --> 34:47.711
And then a Levite,
a religious functionary, he...

34:49.087 --> 34:52.173
came to the place,
saw the dying traveler.

34:55.385 --> 35:00.265
But he too moved to the other side
of the road, passed him by.

35:01.474 --> 35:04.853
But then came a man from Samaria,
a Samaritan, a good man.

35:04.936 --> 35:08.690
He saw the traveler bleeding in the road

35:08.774 --> 35:11.484
and he stopped to aid him
without thinking of the circumstance

35:11.567 --> 35:13.319
or the difficulty it might bring him.

35:14.154 --> 35:16.657
The Samaritan tended
to the traveler's wounds,

35:16.740 --> 35:19.242
applying oil and wine.

35:19.325 --> 35:22.871
And he carried him to an inn,

35:22.954 --> 35:25.415
gave him all the money he had

35:25.498 --> 35:28.043
for the owner
to take care of the traveler,

35:28.126 --> 35:30.253
as the Samaritan, he...

35:30.336 --> 35:32.463
continued on his journey.

35:33.464 --> 35:37.886
He did this simply because
the traveler was his neighbor.

35:37.969 --> 35:41.640
He loved his city
and all the people in it.

35:43.141 --> 35:46.061
[sighs deeply]

35:50.356 --> 35:54.069
I always thought that
I was the Samaritan in that story.

35:56.029 --> 35:57.447
It's funny, isn't it?

35:57.530 --> 36:00.116
How even the best of men can be...

36:00.200 --> 36:02.744
deceived by their true nature.

36:02.828 --> 36:03.954
What the hell does that mean?

36:04.037 --> 36:06.581
It means that I'm not the Samaritan.

36:07.708 --> 36:11.544
That I'm not the priest, or the Levite.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.674
That I am the ill intent...

36:17.383 --> 36:22.305
who set upon the traveler on a road
that he should not have been on.

36:25.558 --> 36:27.393
[brakes screeching]

36:27.477 --> 36:28.854
[tires screeching]

36:40.115 --> 36:41.950
-Go, go!
-Oh, shit!

Tac One! Tac One!
Requesting sitrep! How copy?

37:12.313 --> 37:15.150
We're taking fire! We're taking fire!
Requesting backup.

37:20.363 --> 37:22.657
What appears now
to be some sort of firefight

37:22.741 --> 37:25.744
involving the FBI transport
carrying Wilson Fisk.

37:25.827 --> 37:27.829
Uh, Janet, can you confirm
what we're seeing here?

37:30.456 --> 37:34.002
Jesus, we were idiots, weren't we?
Sitting here, celebrating,

37:34.085 --> 37:36.546
thinking that it would be that easy
with a man like him.

37:36.629 --> 37:39.382
Let's get out of here before they
close down the streets or something.

37:40.466 --> 37:41.592
[Matt] Get her home.
[Foggy] Okay.

37:41.676 --> 37:43.261
No, no, where are you going?
We're not leaving you.

37:43.344 --> 37:45.305
Back to my place, make some calls,
see what I can find out.

37:45.388 --> 37:46.848
-We'll drop you.
-You live on the other side of town.

37:46.932 --> 37:47.974
I'll be all right.

37:48.058 --> 37:49.517
Hang on, I'll get him a cab.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.895
-Wait, Foggy--
-[Matt] Taxi!

37:51.978 --> 37:53.479
[Foggy] You heard
what's going on out there.

37:53.563 --> 37:55.065
You can't go up against that
in your black pajamas.

37:55.148 --> 37:56.191
-I won't be.
-Matt--

37:56.274 --> 37:57.567
I know I haven't earned it,
not yet anyway,

37:57.650 --> 38:00.653
but I'm asking you to trust me, Foggy.
I know what I'm doing.

38:02.322 --> 38:04.240
All right.

38:05.575 --> 38:09.037
Go be a hero.
Just don't get killed doing it, okay?

38:10.288 --> 38:11.414
Where you headed?

38:15.543 --> 38:17.003
[indistinct radio chatter]

38:22.383 --> 38:24.510
[officers grunting]

38:24.594 --> 38:27.138
[man] Perimeter secure.
Retrieving package.

38:30.266 --> 38:32.811
I don't know who you assholes
think you are, but if you don't back away,

38:32.894 --> 38:35.438
I swear to God, I'll put a bullet
in this fat son of a bitch!

38:38.649 --> 38:39.985
Let's get you out of here, sir.

38:45.949 --> 38:47.575
Package acquired.

38:56.667 --> 38:58.419
[man] Move! Move!

38:59.963 --> 39:01.589
Go!

39:26.406 --> 39:31.077
If anyone tries to follow,
on the ground or in the air,

39:31.161 --> 39:32.662
take them out.

39:33.829 --> 39:35.581
[distant sirens wailing]

39:42.755 --> 39:45.716
Haven't had enough time to get
all of it through the process.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.261
[sighs]

39:48.344 --> 39:50.555
Black parts will give the most protection.

39:51.890 --> 39:56.394
Red might deflect a knife,
depending on the angle...

39:57.728 --> 39:59.064
might not.

40:12.743 --> 40:14.120
It'll do just fine.

40:15.705 --> 40:16.998
Thank you, Melvin.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.335
Betsy?

40:21.711 --> 40:24.005
She gonna be safe now from Mr. Fisk?

40:24.089 --> 40:26.299
I made you a promise.

40:26.382 --> 40:27.758
I intend to keep it.

All units, be advised,

40:44.109 --> 40:46.361
do not approach subject if sighted.

40:46.444 --> 40:49.905
Notify ESU forthwith.
Repeat, do not approach.

41:23.064 --> 41:24.149

I say again...

41:41.916 --> 41:43.251
[over radio]
...the package is en route.

41:43.334 --> 41:45.628
ETA 18 minutes.
Prepare for extraction.

41:45.711 --> 41:47.130
Copy that.

41:47.213 --> 41:48.964
-Sir?
-Thank you.

41:50.841 --> 41:54.512
I know this has been
a difficult chapter in our lives.

41:54.595 --> 41:56.764
[Vanessa] We'll be together,
that's all that matters.

41:56.847 --> 42:00.685
Now, if I'm not there
by your side in 20 minutes...

42:00.768 --> 42:02.270
I want you to leave.

42:02.353 --> 42:04.855
I'm not gonna let them
take you away from me, Wilson.

42:04.939 --> 42:06.816
If I'm not there by that time...

42:07.900 --> 42:10.611
there isn't anything you can do
to stop that from happening.

42:10.695 --> 42:13.989
But it won't be the end, Vanessa.
[stammering] It's...

42:16.617 --> 42:18.786
it's just an inconvenience.

42:18.869 --> 42:21.831
Nothing will ever keep us apart.

42:21.914 --> 42:23.749
[sighs]

42:34.635 --> 42:38.681
Fifteen minutes to the drop.

43:09.795 --> 43:12.006
You were right...

43:12.090 --> 43:14.884
what you told me
over the radio that night.

43:16.261 --> 43:18.679
Not everyone deserves a happy ending.

You?

[gunfire]

44:11.732 --> 44:14.444
I wanted to make this city...

44:14.527 --> 44:17.447
something better than it is.

44:18.030 --> 44:20.283
Something beautiful.

44:20.366 --> 44:22.452
You took that away from me!

44:23.869 --> 44:25.746
You took everything!

44:27.207 --> 44:29.167
I'm gonna kill you!

46:08.849 --> 46:12.687
This city doesn't deserve
a better tomorrow.

46:12.770 --> 46:15.272
It deserves to drown...

46:15.356 --> 46:17.107
in its filth!

46:17.191 --> 46:21.028
It deserves people like my father!
People like you!

47:00.735 --> 47:02.945
You really think that this will...

47:04.447 --> 47:06.657
change anything?

47:10.411 --> 47:12.830
You think one man in...

47:14.081 --> 47:15.541
a silly little costume...

47:15.625 --> 47:17.209
will...

47:17.292 --> 47:18.919
will make a difference?

-Show me your hands!
-[panting]

47:55.164 --> 47:56.791
I told you before, Sergeant...

47:57.750 --> 47:59.419
I'm not the bad guy.

48:00.628 --> 48:03.631
Holy shit, it's you.

48:04.173 --> 48:07.718
This man was a fugitive from the law,
and I stopped him.

49:43.689 --> 49:45.024
Thank you, Sergeant.

49:45.107 --> 49:48.193
Hey, so what am I supposed to call you
when I file my report?

49:53.073 --> 49:54.158
[Karen] Daredevil.

49:55.535 --> 49:56.744
That's what they're calling him now.

The man in the mask.

49:58.579 --> 50:00.205
Daredevil?

50:00.289 --> 50:03.626
Sounds like he's gonna jump
Snake River Canyon on his rocket cycle.

50:03.709 --> 50:06.045
[laughing] It kinda does, doesn't it?

50:06.128 --> 50:07.171
Okay, okay.

50:07.254 --> 50:09.882
I thought it was a bit goofy at first,
but it kinda grows on you.

50:09.965 --> 50:12.384
And it's better than
the Devil of Hell's Kitchen anyway.

50:12.467 --> 50:14.261
Not wrong there.

50:14.344 --> 50:16.221
[Karen] I cannot believe
this is the same guy

50:16.305 --> 50:20.017
that stopped that Union Allied nut
from stabbing me in my apartment.

50:21.018 --> 50:22.728
That is a serious upgrade.

50:22.812 --> 50:24.980
I don't know,
I think the horns are a bit much.

50:25.898 --> 50:27.733
There! Done!

50:28.859 --> 50:29.944
What do you think?

50:30.027 --> 50:31.528
I think I'm glad
I fished it out of the trash.

50:31.612 --> 50:32.863
Me too.

50:35.240 --> 50:36.951
Nelson and Murdock.

50:38.703 --> 50:40.996
-Avocados at law.
-[chuckling]

50:41.080 --> 50:42.331
"Avocados"?

50:42.915 --> 50:44.416
It's a long story.

50:44.499 --> 50:47.962
Which I do not have time to tell you.

50:48.045 --> 50:50.005
Promised Marci
I'd help her find a new job

50:50.089 --> 50:52.424
since most of the partners at
Landman and Zack are under indictment.

50:52.507 --> 50:54.301
Oh? You two getting back together?

50:54.384 --> 50:56.011
No.
I don't know.

50:56.095 --> 50:57.137
Maybe.

50:57.221 --> 50:58.347
[both laugh]

50:59.389 --> 51:01.934
Well, thank her for us.

51:02.017 --> 51:04.103
For everything she did
helping bring Fisk down.

51:04.645 --> 51:06.105
Fisk still needs to go to trial.

51:06.188 --> 51:08.691
Just getting a court date on a case
this big could take a year.

51:08.774 --> 51:10.776
-That long?
-He's where he belongs,

51:10.860 --> 51:12.194
that's all that matters.

51:12.277 --> 51:13.946
And we put him there.

51:14.029 --> 51:16.323
Yeah, we did.

51:16.406 --> 51:17.574
Hell of a sign.

51:18.325 --> 51:20.077
Now all we need are clients.

51:20.160 --> 51:22.955
One day at a time, partner.
One day at a time.

51:26.416 --> 51:28.168
Guess that means
we should get back to work.

51:29.879 --> 51:32.589
-Hey, Karen.
-Yeah.

51:35.843 --> 51:38.553
There's been something
in your voice.

51:40.097 --> 51:43.558
[stammers] It's been there
for a while now.

51:43.643 --> 51:46.311
I thought whatever it was,
whatever's been...

51:47.104 --> 51:50.858
I thought it would get better once
Fisk was put away, but...

51:53.861 --> 51:55.195
it hasn't, has it?

51:59.199 --> 52:00.701
[sighs]

52:00.785 --> 52:02.619
We put him away, yeah...

52:05.330 --> 52:07.041
but it won't bring back Elena...

52:08.583 --> 52:09.794
or Ben...

52:11.962 --> 52:14.589
or erase what we've been through, or...

52:16.425 --> 52:18.510
what we've had to do to get here.

52:18.593 --> 52:20.137
Yeah.

52:22.472 --> 52:25.267
A lot of decisions I'd give anything
to go back and change.

52:25.350 --> 52:27.019
[breathes deeply]

52:27.102 --> 52:28.562
But I can't.

52:29.814 --> 52:31.356
None of us can.

52:32.983 --> 52:36.528
It's like I told Foggy,
all we can do is move forward...

52:38.572 --> 52:40.532
together.

53:01.053 --> 53:02.888
Come on.

53:13.398 --> 53:15.692
[inmates speaking indistinctly]

53:28.122 --> 53:30.124
[sighs]

53:57.359 --> 53:59.945
[woman screaming]

54:14.794 --> 54:16.796
[dramatic music playing]
