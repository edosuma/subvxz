00:00.070 --> 00:01.399
<i>Previously on “Boston Legal”</i>

00:01.439 --> 00:02.584
I'd like to get married.

00:02.624 --> 00:03.126
What?

00:03.166 --> 00:03.985
I wanna get married.

00:04.025 --> 00:05.213
The answer is yes.

00:05.823 --> 00:07.209
May I kiss the bride?

00:10.045 --> 00:11.059
It should be you.

00:11.099 --> 00:12.041
It's wooden Judge.

00:12.081 --> 00:14.023
A propreoseptive tool.

00:14.063 --> 00:15.063
What is this?

00:15.077 --> 00:16.004
New therapy.

00:16.044 --> 00:16.458
Good, isn't it?

00:16.498 --> 00:18.346
You will be utterly reduced
to an ineffective,

00:18.386 --> 00:21.258
mumbling, inarticulate man
with Asbergers disease.

00:21.298 --> 00:23.230
I'll hold you in contempt right now.

00:23.270 --> 00:24.297
My handcuffs or yours?

00:24.337 --> 00:26.067
You better respect this robe, Alan.

00:26.107 --> 00:28.207
Shall we get started, Judge?

00:28.696 --> 00:31.296
I'm gonna hate myself in the morning.

00:38.194 --> 00:42.110
I really appreciate you taking the time
to see me. You look great, by the way.

00:42.150 --> 00:43.908
You should see me naked.

00:43.908 --> 00:46.655
Really? I always found you
much sexier fully-clothed.

00:46.695 --> 00:48.870
Is that why you always took me skiing?

00:48.910 --> 00:50.413
Anything to get you in a parka.

00:50.453 --> 00:53.681
I can see the two of you had
a personal history together.

00:53.721 --> 00:56.740
Can I have one? You're so desirable.

00:57.194 --> 00:59.790
How can I help you, Kaye?

00:59.790 --> 01:04.242
Okay. Don't laugh. These
are called Tarties dolls.

01:05.197 --> 01:09.158
My daughter plays with them,
or wishes she could. She's six.

01:10.054 --> 01:13.412
Many of her friends have them,
the ones who don't, want them,

01:13.452 --> 01:16.752
and as you can see,
they look like little hookers.

01:16.800 --> 01:18.691
I bet they make great stocking stuffers.

01:18.731 --> 01:23.563
They sell them nationwide at major retailers,
including Fletcher's at the mall in my town.

01:23.603 --> 01:25.968
It's the equivalent of pornography
in my opinion, which…

01:26.008 --> 01:27.700
–you know I support.

01:27.906 --> 01:31.908
My daughter got these as gifts for her birthday.
These were her favorite gifts, by the way.

01:31.948 --> 01:34.588
But not your favorite, I suspect.
Denny.

01:34.963 --> 01:37.565
Fletcher's is a family-oriented
department store.

01:37.605 --> 01:42.039
You've seen their commercials.
I would like to somehow get them
to discontinue selling these.

01:42.079 --> 01:44.308
It's totally irresponsible. My daughter is six.

01:44.348 --> 01:47.986
Kaye, you can't possibly expect me to
oppose something as titillating as—

01:48.026 --> 01:51.768
Alan, I said my daughter.
She's also your daughter.

01:55.422 --> 01:58.527
Okay, she's not, but imagine
if you had one. Do you?

01:58.567 --> 02:00.018
Not that I know of, but…

02:00.058 --> 02:02.463
Please? I really wanna shut this down.

02:02.503 --> 02:04.702
We have no grounds whatsoever to—

02:04.702 --> 02:07.125
I would think Fletcher's would be
concerned about the negative publicity.

02:07.165 --> 02:07.839
Denny.

02:07.839 --> 02:11.342
Just get us in the courtroom… please?

02:11.342 --> 02:15.006
Let me try the long shot first.
I'll contact counsel for Fletcher's

02:15.046 --> 02:18.960
and persuade them that it might be in their
best interest to voluntarily pull the dolls.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.026
But I must say Kaye these dolls to
me seem… good for society.

02:23.867 --> 02:26.369
Thank you. Mr Crane, thank you.

02:26.369 --> 02:28.273
Not to worry. We never lose.

02:28.273 --> 02:29.243
I'll be in touch.

02:29.283 --> 02:30.533
Okay.

02:34.131 --> 02:34.812
Give it to me.

02:34.852 --> 02:36.933
What?

02:36.933 --> 02:39.019
Denny. Give me the doll.

02:42.658 --> 02:43.858
She's hot.

03:17.093 --> 03:19.728
Hey, Shirley.

03:19.728 --> 03:22.090
Hey! What's going on?

03:22.090 --> 03:23.340
Well…

03:23.340 --> 03:25.200
We have a little announcement to make.

03:25.240 --> 03:30.009
Brad and I are getting married.

03:30.009 --> 03:34.255
Oh! Please! Very funny.

03:34.255 --> 03:37.753
No. I… We are. I love him
and I decided to marry him.

03:37.971 --> 03:44.869
Oh. Oh! Oh, well. That is wonderful!

03:48.992 --> 03:51.710
Why do you think this is so ridiculous?

03:51.710 --> 03:56.910
I do not think it's ridiculous.
I'm… I'm just overwhelmed. I,

03:57.842 --> 04:03.112
I mean we all thought it was just a
matter of time before you two love-birds…

04:03.946 --> 04:09.649
Ha… I don't know what to say… ha, ha.

04:22.460 --> 04:23.771
Are you making fun of me?

04:23.811 --> 04:24.819
Uh… no sir.

04:24.819 --> 04:26.215
I saw you. You hopped.

04:26.255 --> 04:31.994
Oh. I got this sense that you were
about to hop, and I just hopped too.

04:32.696 --> 04:34.727
It wasn't to make fun of you.

04:39.843 --> 04:41.200
Why are you following me?

04:41.240 --> 04:44.408
Oh. I'm Mr Shore's assistant.
This is my office.

04:44.667 --> 04:46.650
Oh. He in?

04:46.650 --> 04:49.003
Yes, sir.

04:52.525 --> 04:55.049
Thanks, much!

04:58.072 --> 05:00.472
How we doin', Al?
Good to see you.

05:00.472 --> 05:02.773
Family's good I take it!

05:02.773 --> 05:05.648
Jerry. I don't have a family.

05:06.007 --> 05:11.473
Small courtesies. Don't take it literal, Al.
Your people called my people about Fletcher's.

05:11.513 --> 05:12.459
What can I do you for?

05:12.499 --> 05:13.867
You represent Fletcher's
Department Stores?

05:13.907 --> 05:18.719
Some. Not all. I represent the one you're
trying to shake down. What's the problem?

05:18.759 --> 05:22.983
Before we discuss that problem,
I'd like to address ours, Jerry.

05:23.222 --> 05:27.179
Didn't know we had one.
What have I done now?

05:27.179 --> 05:28.639
Would you please stop that?

05:28.679 --> 05:31.306
No. This is the persona
I use in my cases.

05:31.346 --> 05:34.232
Especially against
the tricky, sleazy lawyers!

05:34.272 --> 05:37.278
Which I consider you to be.
I say it with affection, Al.

05:37.318 --> 05:41.956
Jerry, please, stop it. May I have
the wooden cigarette, please?

05:41.986 --> 05:44.923
No, I use this.
If you don't like it, tough!

05:46.715 --> 05:48.144
Okay.

05:49.170 --> 05:50.643
First off, I'm thrilled for you.

05:50.683 --> 05:54.020
I'm very impressed… Fletcher's
Department Stores for a client.

05:54.060 --> 06:00.456
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now we're both blowin' fake smoke.
Qué es la problema with mi cliento?

06:00.462 --> 06:05.183
Your client sells these dolls,
they're called Tarties,

06:05.234 --> 06:08.763
quite sexual in nature and yet they market
them to children. We'd like them to stop.

06:08.803 --> 06:13.055
My client makes a lot of money on those
dolls, Al. They're just harmless fun.

06:13.095 --> 06:17.144
Do you have a collection?
That might make Patty jealous.

06:17.243 --> 06:20.126
Nice try, Al.
What else you got?

06:25.095 --> 06:27.207
I don't like the new you, Jerry.

06:30.045 --> 06:32.152
Sorry to disappoint.

06:32.153 --> 06:33.153
We done here?

06:37.781 --> 06:39.758
Yes. See you in court.

06:39.861 --> 06:43.333
It's a date! My best to the Mrs.

06:55.624 --> 06:56.923
The wooden cigarette? Again?

06:56.963 --> 07:00.004
Yeah. I've lost a friend, Denny.

07:00.087 --> 07:05.887
It was so upsetting to… oh…
I've lost a very good friend.

07:05.951 --> 07:08.431
In other words he succeeded
in distracting you.

07:08.471 --> 07:13.918
Say what you will about Hands, Alan, the
man's a genius. He's trading on your guilt here.

07:13.958 --> 07:17.316
Putting you in the exact
state of mind you're in.

07:17.345 --> 07:20.711
It's not the wooden cigarette
he's using. It's you.

07:21.379 --> 07:23.506
I wonder.

07:23.546 --> 07:24.990
Denny!

07:25.082 --> 07:27.838
The interview for the
new litigation associate…

07:27.878 --> 07:28.878
Yes.

07:29.310 --> 07:30.397
Well, if you're too busy…

07:30.437 --> 07:31.531
No, no, not too busy.

07:31.571 --> 07:32.673
It's okay, we can, we can—

07:32.713 --> 07:35.478
No, no. I'd like to meet him.
I hear he's very good.

07:35.518 --> 07:41.076
Yeah. He's a terrific candidate.
And Denny… we don't want to lose him.

07:41.439 --> 07:43.742
And you're afraid I'll say
the wrong thing and blow it?

07:43.782 --> 07:45.890
No. It's not that. It's uh…

07:45.972 --> 07:47.789
It's uh… what, Paul? What?

07:48.128 --> 07:52.397
Well… what if he says the wrong thing?

07:52.572 --> 07:54.231
We're afraid you'll shoot him.

07:54.271 --> 07:55.921
We need this guy, Denny.

07:55.961 --> 07:57.274
I'll take the interview.

07:57.314 --> 07:57.719
Ugh.

07:57.751 --> 07:58.850
And Paul?

07:58.914 --> 08:02.114
On your way out, when
you pass the receptionist,

08:02.239 --> 08:06.133
check out the name of the firm.
See whose name comes first.

08:21.212 --> 08:26.860
Shirley? Why do you think it's so
ridiculous that I'm gonna marry Brad?

08:26.934 --> 08:28.829
I don't.

08:28.850 --> 08:32.376
Yes, you do. I saw your face. Come on.
You've always been honest with me.

08:32.417 --> 08:36.529
Oh, ho! That is not true.
If I had a nickel for every lie—

08:36.616 --> 08:38.408
Please.

08:41.133 --> 08:43.245
Why does my opinion even matter?

08:43.426 --> 08:45.449
Because it does!

08:45.480 --> 08:49.419
Well, that should tell you something right there.
If you need the approval of others…

08:49.459 --> 08:53.030
I don't need approval.
I just wanted… I don't know.

08:53.079 --> 08:53.309
Advice?

08:53.349 --> 08:55.475
Maybe. Yeah.

08:58.424 --> 09:00.860
Ah. You, you don't love him.

09:02.650 --> 09:04.350
At least not enough.

09:04.445 --> 09:08.746
You're having his baby; it's no doubt
the practical thing to marry him.

09:08.786 --> 09:13.486
Perhaps even better for the baby,
but um… you don't love him enough.

09:13.577 --> 09:16.415
How dare you? What
business is it of yours?

09:23.990 --> 09:25.610
Mr Shore?

09:25.654 --> 09:26.576
You all set?

09:26.616 --> 09:31.792
Yes. I didn't challenge zoning
in the motion. I alleged nuisance.

09:31.885 --> 09:32.396
Nuisance?

09:32.436 --> 09:36.780
Yes. It's more viable. It's a question
of fact. It won't get kicked.

09:36.820 --> 09:38.563
Okay.

09:38.620 --> 09:41.733
Ah, you don't seem focused, Alan.

09:41.756 --> 09:48.034
I'm not! I'm up against a friend who…
he's doing what you do, I suppose.

09:48.111 --> 09:56.211
He's taking on a false persona which makes him
feel more comfortable, because in his own skin…

09:57.174 --> 10:00.168
Part of me feels that I've helped to
destroy the real Jerry Espenson.

10:00.208 --> 10:02.254
And I feel horrible about that.

10:02.706 --> 10:06.711
Okay. In the meantime
you got a case to do.

10:06.758 --> 10:11.406
You need to go win this, Alan. For your
friend. For her daughter. For Jerry.

10:11.446 --> 10:12.874
For Jerry? How so?

10:12.951 --> 10:14.892
If he beats you at full strength, fine.

10:14.932 --> 10:22.632
But if he senses you're in there feeling sorry
for him… Take it from me, that's the worst.

10:23.969 --> 10:25.248
So I should go in there and…

10:25.288 --> 10:26.884
Kick his ass.

10:27.505 --> 10:31.721
I suppose you're right. Most honorable
thing I could do would be to…

10:31.761 --> 10:36.660
Kick. His. Ass.

10:39.320 --> 10:46.663
All rise. Case number 77264, Kaye
Kent vs Fletcher's Department Store.

10:48.801 --> 10:49.807
Oh, dear.

10:49.832 --> 10:51.818
What, oh dear?

10:51.909 --> 10:55.391
This may not be the ideal Judge.
She'd like these dolls more than I do.

10:55.431 --> 10:57.799
Your Honor, we would ask that
you dismiss this complaint

10:57.839 --> 11:01.907
on the face of the allegations, none of
which support a viable cause of action.

11:01.947 --> 11:05.556
My client sells these dolls
nationwide without incident.

11:05.596 --> 11:08.356
Is there something unique about the
plaintiff's particular neighborhood?

11:08.396 --> 11:11.955
Before we get started I would ask
that Your Honor recuse herself.

11:11.995 --> 11:14.261
The Judge and I are friends, Jerry.

11:14.301 --> 11:15.325
Yes, Alan.

11:15.366 --> 11:19.983
And the wheels of justice would grind to a
halt if we recused every jurist you've slept with.

11:20.023 --> 11:22.760
Tell you what. How about we go with,
“Don't ask, don't tell?”

11:22.800 --> 11:24.921
Because for me the bragging gets old.

11:24.961 --> 11:29.363
Oh, don't worry, Your Honor, he said you were
phenomenal. He's got you on his Top Ten list.

11:29.403 --> 11:30.286
Excuse me?

11:30.365 --> 11:35.399
That is not true! I didn't tell him
anything. He's completely fabricating.

11:35.405 --> 11:39.222
Oh! Oh, because you sleep with so many
Judges he made an educated guess?

11:39.262 --> 11:41.722
No, no, no, no, no, no.. Nooooo! I…

11:41.801 --> 11:44.574
Your Honor, I don't doubt
you can remain impartial.

11:44.614 --> 11:47.984
Despite Counsel's claim that you eat out of
the palm of his— was it the right hand?

11:48.024 --> 11:48.867
Jerry!

11:48.956 --> 11:52.467
Sorry! Maybe you should step down
if you're as obsessed as he says.

11:52.507 --> 11:55.636
I will stay right where I am! Thank you.

11:55.752 --> 11:59.060
Your Honor, Mr Espenson has
represented me in a very false light…

11:59.100 --> 12:03.322
Kneepad Nellie, your words, Alan,
not right, step down, Your Honor.

12:03.362 --> 12:05.474
Mr Shore, call your first witness.

12:05.514 --> 12:06.754
Did you say kneepad?

12:06.794 --> 12:09.436
Or I will dismiss your motion right now.

12:09.517 --> 12:12.692
She seems upset.

12:22.413 --> 12:23.865
It's a real honor to meet you.

12:23.905 --> 12:25.532
I'm sure it is.

12:25.625 --> 12:29.998
I can only imagine, thinking back when
I was a kid starting out in the practice of law…

12:30.038 --> 12:33.238
if I had met someone like me. Wow!

12:33.263 --> 12:35.114
Yes, yes.

12:35.393 --> 12:36.548
So?

12:40.878 --> 12:42.878
Who do you like for President?

12:42.892 --> 12:47.613
Uh. Well, I think I would have to learn more
about all of the candidates before I could—

12:47.653 --> 12:50.286
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But if you had to
vote today, who do you like?

12:50.326 --> 12:52.692
That's kind of a personal question, sir.

12:52.732 --> 12:55.834
Oh, come on. We're
talking about public office.

12:55.928 --> 12:58.800
We keep our public opinions personal,
does that make sense to you?

12:58.840 --> 12:59.740
Well, who do you like?

12:59.780 --> 13:01.826
Jeb.

13:02.255 --> 13:03.886
I don't believe he's running, sir.

13:03.926 --> 13:06.174
Oh, he will.

13:06.764 --> 13:09.237
Last twenty years, there's been
two families in the White House.

13:09.277 --> 13:12.102
The Bushes and the Clintons.
That's the way it is.

13:12.142 --> 13:15.332
We like our dynasties here.
It's the closest thing to having a king.

13:15.372 --> 13:19.668
Which we need if we wanna keep attacking foreign
countries against the will of the American people.

13:19.708 --> 13:25.608
Two families. That leaves Hillary and Jeb.
And if it's Hillary, you don't work here, bub.

13:25.648 --> 13:29.727
Well, if working here is conditioned
on aligning myself

13:29.779 --> 13:31.658
with either a candidate
or a political party,

13:31.698 --> 13:33.551
then I don't wanna work here.

13:33.591 --> 13:34.420
Atta boy!

13:34.694 --> 13:39.163
I like a man who puts himself out on a
limb to avoid answering a question.

13:39.203 --> 13:41.603
'Course, that makes you a Democrat.

13:41.687 --> 13:44.487
You drink? We like to drink around here.

13:47.249 --> 13:49.306
I'm not a prude. I'm really not.

13:49.346 --> 13:55.347
You don't have to tell me, I'm—
Please continue.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.868
Wait, wait, wait.
You've been with her?

13:57.908 --> 14:00.529
Your Honor, that's… really irrelevant.

14:00.623 --> 14:03.262
I find it's easier to keep track of
the girls he hasn't been with.

14:03.302 --> 14:05.632
Do you mind?

14:08.467 --> 14:10.617
Ms Kent. Please continue.

14:10.657 --> 14:13.633
It's just these dolls are so overtly sexual.

14:13.744 --> 14:15.168
To market them to children…

14:15.208 --> 14:17.980
That one is actually wearing a lace thong.

14:21.518 --> 14:25.812
But, Ms Kent, you must admit this
would present quite a slippery slope.

14:25.852 --> 14:29.916
There are many products in today's society,
be they music, clothing, videos,

14:29.956 --> 14:34.256
that are much more overtly sexual.

14:34.344 --> 14:36.880
Most of those are aimed at teenagers.

14:36.948 --> 14:38.923
These dolls are more for girls
in elementary school.

14:38.963 --> 14:42.217
Read what's on the box,
“She knows how to flaunt it.”

14:42.257 --> 14:46.038
They're prostitots. And they're
selling them in a toy store.

14:46.078 --> 14:51.778
In your deposition you stated that your
daughter watched The Kids' Choice Awards?

14:51.823 --> 14:52.494
Yes.

14:52.531 --> 14:54.220
I see they nominated Eminem.

14:54.260 --> 14:59.081
Funny, his CD's are labeled ‘parental
advisory, lyrics not suitable for kids. ’

14:59.121 --> 15:01.594
I don't let her listen to
or watch Eminem.

15:01.634 --> 15:04.025
Oh, just the channels
that glorify his lyrics?

15:04.065 --> 15:07.113
Objection, Counsel is putting
lyrics in my client's mouth.

15:07.153 --> 15:08.024
Good one, Al.

15:08.101 --> 15:11.538
I see you wear clothes by Abernathy and
Crotch, or whatever that's called.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.949
I assume you mean…

15:13.009 --> 15:15.192
Your daughter ever go in the store
with you when you shop there?

15:15.232 --> 15:15.837
She has.

15:15.892 --> 15:19.385
She see the T-shirts made for ten-year-olds
with ‘Eye Candy’ written on the front?

15:19.425 --> 15:22.350
Or the other T-shirt that says,
“Who need brains when I got these?”

15:22.390 --> 15:24.229
I would not let her wear that.

15:24.269 --> 15:26.968
How 'bout all the sex on television?

15:27.346 --> 15:28.322
I don't like it.

15:28.362 --> 15:34.407
I read where music videos now contain
ninety-three sexual situations per hour.

15:34.447 --> 15:36.829
Your daughter ever watch music videos?

15:36.869 --> 15:39.313
Sometimes, I try to monitor
what she watches—

15:39.353 --> 15:40.450
But not what she plays with?

15:40.490 --> 15:43.747
Got it. So I take it you don't
have “Grand Theft Auto”

15:43.787 --> 15:47.433
that video game where they had the players
simulate sex acts with prostitutes?

15:47.473 --> 15:48.754
We do not have that game.

15:48.794 --> 15:51.011
But they sold it at Fletcher's, why not
sue for that while you're at it?

15:51.051 --> 15:51.478
Objection.

15:51.518 --> 15:52.488
Wha, wha, wha, what?

15:52.528 --> 15:56.272
You, Jerry. You. Your whole… demeanor.

15:56.444 --> 16:01.028
Your Honor, in the absence of a case he's
attacking the witness personally.

16:01.068 --> 16:02.718
Objection overruled.

16:02.812 --> 16:08.435
You ever watch that show about the
horny housewives? Lotta sex there, I tell ya.

16:08.490 --> 16:11.234
I watch it, but I wouldn't let
my six-year-old watch.

16:11.274 --> 16:14.709
She might like it, it's one of the top twenty
shows with children age two to eleven.

16:14.749 --> 16:17.045
Can't believe a mother
hasn't sued for that.

16:17.085 --> 16:19.915
Your Honor, this mocking tone
is entirely inappropriate–

16:19.955 --> 16:22.169
Ooh, Sorry. I'll go into rehab.

16:22.227 --> 16:25.779
Did you ever take your daughter to a
psychologist after she played with these dolls?

16:25.819 --> 16:26.705
No.

16:26.745 --> 16:29.400
So she really hasn't been
that harmed, in your opinion.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.489
I can only hope not.

16:31.510 --> 16:33.585
Thanks much.

16:42.166 --> 16:44.614
Your Honor, I'd like to call
an expert witness to testify

16:44.654 --> 16:50.350
as to how the proliferation of sexual content
in the marketplace is having an adverse effect—

16:50.390 --> 16:52.529
Speculation. Al, you're better than that.

16:52.569 --> 16:53.992
Sustained.

16:54.034 --> 16:56.823
Certainly I'm allowed to explore
the negative impact—

16:56.863 --> 17:01.203
No! Your client just testified that she doesn't
think her daughter was actually harmed.

17:01.243 --> 17:06.354
Only because I've been able to fend off the
assault so far, but if things start getting worse—

17:06.394 --> 17:09.057
This is not moot court, Ms Kent.

17:09.138 --> 17:11.343
Your Honor, may I see you in chambers?

17:11.383 --> 17:14.530
Here we go. He told me
he'd play this card.

17:14.554 --> 17:17.819
Jerry!

17:18.169 --> 17:20.169
Your Honor? Chambers.

17:20.200 --> 17:24.539
It'll be at your own risk,
Mr Shore. Let's go.

17:28.219 --> 17:31.321
Jerry. Watch out. You
just might win this case.

17:31.370 --> 17:36.320
Don't have it be because you've turned
into this terrible, horrible person.

17:36.548 --> 17:37.986
Is that all you got?

17:38.054 --> 17:39.787
You wanna call me the bumbling
guy with Asperger's again?

17:39.827 --> 17:40.883
Bring it on, Al.

17:48.362 --> 17:52.840
Okay. First, I never said to opposing
counsel any of the things he attributed…

17:52.880 --> 17:53.884
How'd he know then?

17:53.924 --> 17:55.310
I indicated in court…

17:55.324 --> 17:58.144
No, no, no. No.
You said we were friends.

17:58.198 --> 18:00.625
Well, he just…

18:00.627 --> 18:08.385
Made an educated guess? How many
judges have you slept with, Alan?

18:08.631 --> 18:13.890
Something tells me I'm not going to be able
to provide any satisfactory response here.

18:13.930 --> 18:17.560
Maybe his guess went to
your sexual esprit, that would…

18:17.857 --> 18:20.365
…definitely not be the right response.

18:20.475 --> 18:25.807
Perhaps we should ask a different
question. Why didn't you call?

18:26.024 --> 18:26.975
What?

18:27.033 --> 18:28.779
Well, after we made love.
Right here.

18:28.819 --> 18:33.719
Why didn't you call? Was I just
a hit and run number to you?

18:33.731 --> 18:36.688
Suddenly it smells like high school.

18:36.925 --> 18:39.313
Why. Didn't. You. Call?

18:39.371 --> 18:41.736
Well I suppose I could ask,
why didn't you call?

18:41.776 --> 18:49.803
You could. And my answer would
be I did. Twice. Both went unreturned.

18:50.175 --> 18:51.601
Oh.

18:51.641 --> 18:52.749
Hm.

18:52.789 --> 18:53.999
Your Honor.

18:54.010 --> 18:54.971
One would hope that
you wouldn't let your

18:55.011 --> 19:00.611
personal discomfort here with me
affect your professional objectivity.

19:01.025 --> 19:02.015
One would hope.

19:03.773 --> 19:06.439
This not going well at all.

19:16.784 --> 19:19.490
I assure you, we don't all like to drink.

19:19.874 --> 19:21.225
Nor are we all Republicans.

19:21.265 --> 19:25.951
Look. I am not offering this as a form
of a complaint so much as… well…

19:25.990 --> 19:30.346
I'm resigning myself to the fact
that Denny Crane did not like me.

19:31.742 --> 19:33.713
Even if that were true, which I doubt,

19:33.753 --> 19:38.532
we are not an autocracy here, not
withstanding Denny's great affection for kings.

19:38.572 --> 19:40.696
Someone's talking about me?
My back was itching.

19:40.736 --> 19:46.481
Denny. Mr Givens is under the impression
that his interview with you didn't go well.

19:46.505 --> 19:51.785
Oh, don't be silly. Man's a keeper.
Smart. Good-looking. Articulate. I like him.

19:56.421 --> 19:57.329
There you go.

19:57.339 --> 20:01.365
May I ask…? When you say “articulate”…

20:01.389 --> 20:06.188
I would imagine almost everyone who
comes out of law school is articulate.

20:06.228 --> 20:10.412
Yeah, but… uh… you
know what I mean.

20:10.475 --> 20:13.558
I don't, actually.

20:13.619 --> 20:16.836
Well, I mean it like, ah…
Joe Biden meant it.

20:17.506 --> 20:22.522
The way they mean it when they say
Condi Rice is soooo articulate. That way.

20:23.930 --> 20:26.372
But I still don't know what you mean.

20:27.491 --> 20:30.551
You don't sound black!

20:37.579 --> 20:42.779
To say we are trying to influence
our culture, it's ridiculous.

20:42.850 --> 20:44.923
And would not make good
business sense, by the way.

20:44.963 --> 20:46.497
So what are you doing
with these dolls?

20:46.537 --> 20:49.364
We are recognizing a market
and trying to compete in it.

20:49.404 --> 20:51.503
Not all kids wanna play
with Barbies anymore.

20:51.543 --> 20:53.783
Girls are becoming more sophisticated.

20:53.823 --> 20:58.858
They wanna be more like their grown up sisters,
or the characters they watch on television.

20:58.898 --> 21:04.098
Teenagers who wear make-up,
low-cut jeans, and yes, cropped mini-skirts.

21:04.266 --> 21:07.739
That's what they're being exposed
to by the media, including on kids

21:07.779 --> 21:11.487
programming. And that's what they're
now looking for with their dolls.

21:11.527 --> 21:15.558
They might want beer, too.
Doesn't mean we should sell it to them.

21:15.598 --> 21:17.381
There are laws against
selling them alcohol.

21:17.421 --> 21:19.758
There's nothing illegal
about our dolls.

21:19.798 --> 21:23.448
There's a marketing term called “age
compression,” are you familiar with it, sir?

21:23.488 --> 21:25.525
Yes. It's a strategy, we all use it.

21:25.565 --> 21:29.170
It allows our younger buyers to explore
their more grown-up interests.

21:29.210 --> 21:31.455
You mean, you push
adult products on children?

21:31.495 --> 21:35.338
Objection, he uses “push” to make
it sound like drug dealers!

21:35.378 --> 21:37.160
He's a tricky little devil.

21:37.502 --> 21:40.502
Mr Espenson, please sit down.

21:46.341 --> 21:49.411
Sometimes it is like drug-dealing,
isn't it, Mr Costello?

21:49.451 --> 21:53.725
Like those energy drinks which contain
massive amounts of caffeine, aimed at kids—

21:53.765 --> 21:55.395
We do not sell those products.

21:55.435 --> 21:57.287
No, you sell the little hooker dolls.

21:57.327 --> 21:58.274
Objection.

21:58.358 --> 21:59.837
Sustained.

21:59.887 --> 22:01.783
Though you may not wanna
recognize it, Mr Shore,

22:01.823 --> 22:06.998
children, especially girls, are abandoning
their traditional toys at an earlier age.

22:07.038 --> 22:10.587
While many of them are running
around with cell phones and iPods,

22:10.627 --> 22:13.927
we must keep up with their
growing sophistication.

22:14.079 --> 22:15.221
With the little hooker dolls.

22:15.261 --> 22:18.721
Objection! Sleazy! C'mon, Al! Buddy!

22:19.897 --> 22:23.400
Are you aware of studies, sir,
linking the sexualization

22:23.440 --> 22:27.317
of minors with eating disorders,
low self-esteem, depression?

22:27.357 --> 22:29.510
There have been no studies
specifically linking these dolls

22:29.550 --> 22:33.994
with any of those disorders, but hey,
don't let the facts get in your way, bud.

22:34.034 --> 22:34.989
Your Honor—

22:35.042 --> 22:38.306
Sleazy Al, gotta love him.

22:49.181 --> 22:50.228
What have I done now?

22:50.268 --> 22:52.149
“He doesn't sound black?”

22:52.213 --> 22:54.724
Well, he doesn't. Not to me.
Does he to you?

22:54.764 --> 22:57.937
Denny, you truly are not aware of
what a racist statement that is?

22:57.977 --> 23:02.401
Oh, please! Bush and Biden said
the same thing about Obama.

23:02.466 --> 23:03.478
Not like that, they didn't!

23:03.518 --> 23:09.864
Did too. They said, “Articulate.” And
Biden said, “His hygiene looked good.”

23:09.894 --> 23:13.992
Denny. There's no such thing
as “sounding black.”

23:13.993 --> 23:14.766
What do you mean?

23:14.806 --> 23:17.612
Certainly you don't think
all black people sound alike?

23:17.652 --> 23:19.029
Well, of course not.

23:19.095 --> 23:21.936
The anchors on the news
don't sound black at all.

23:21.976 --> 23:25.276
And the black weathermen
sound whiter than me.

23:27.901 --> 23:32.101
It's politically incorrect to
say somebody sounds black.

23:32.238 --> 23:33.986
Alright, then African-American,
I don't care.

23:34.026 --> 23:34.333
No.

23:34.350 --> 23:35.082
Jesse Jacksonish?

23:35.122 --> 23:35.758
No!

23:35.770 --> 23:37.662
Well then how? What!
What do you say?

23:37.702 --> 23:41.464
If a person sounds black,
what's the right way to say it?

23:43.931 --> 23:45.698
Urban.

23:45.706 --> 23:47.950
White people don't live in cities?

23:47.972 --> 23:52.986
Look. There's no such thing
as “sounding black.”

23:53.683 --> 23:54.428
Denny!

23:54.468 --> 24:05.568
The point is, while there may be
certain dialects that are consistent
with African–American vernacular…

24:07.198 --> 24:11.620
You just cannot judge a man's
skin color by the sound of his voice.

24:11.693 --> 24:12.587
Is this a joke?

24:12.627 --> 24:16.587
No, it is not! You have committed
an egregious offense here!

24:16.891 --> 24:19.046
Alright! Let me, let me
get this straight.

24:19.086 --> 24:22.588
Say you get kidnapped and I get
a ransom call from a man who,

24:22.628 --> 24:25.107
to me, sounds black, and the cops says,

24:25.147 --> 24:30.447
“What'd he sound like?”
I should just say, “Male” or?

24:30.504 --> 24:34.104
“I don't know, but
not necessarily black.”

24:45.402 --> 24:47.593
<i>Authorities have arrested a suspect
in a Brookline shooting</i>

24:47.633 --> 24:49.551
<i>that left a local man
in serious condition…</i>

24:49.591 --> 24:52.267
He's kicking my ass again.

24:52.341 --> 24:53.087
Who?

24:53.091 --> 24:57.702
Jerry. And this time I'm
not sure how to unravel him.

24:57.757 --> 24:59.659
He actually seems to have my number.

24:59.699 --> 25:02.410
I had a dream last night
about one of those dolls.

25:02.450 --> 25:04.984
They pitched a tent right
in my bed. It was lovely.

25:05.024 --> 25:07.351
I hate losing. It really
makes me grumpy.

25:07.391 --> 25:09.716
<i>Meanwhile, it seems the law firm
of Crane, Poole and Schmidt</i>

25:09.756 --> 25:12.924
<i>wants its black attorneys
to sound white.</i>

25:12.931 --> 25:15.371
<i>According to Kevin Givens,
a law school candidate</i>

25:15.411 --> 25:20.271
<i>who interviewed at the firm, Denny
Crane himself broke the news to him.</i>

25:20.311 --> 25:23.665
<i>He actually complimented me,
saying, “You don't sound black.”</i>

25:23.705 --> 25:26.619
Ahhh!

25:27.197 --> 25:34.231
Every station has run with it.
We need to respond to this, Shirley.

25:34.324 --> 25:35.884
I take it you've seen the news.

25:35.924 --> 25:36.848
Yes, Marshall.

25:36.864 --> 25:37.905
This is the last straw.

25:37.945 --> 25:38.736
He needs to be removed.

25:38.776 --> 25:44.376
We scheduled an emergency meeting of the
administrative partners for twelve o'clock.

25:45.682 --> 25:49.707
I don't know if we can
save him this time.

25:50.112 --> 25:51.810
Let's call a press conference.

25:51.850 --> 25:53.186
What?

25:53.216 --> 25:55.919
Like you say, we need to respond.

25:55.994 --> 25:57.908
Let's call a news conference.

26:01.806 --> 26:04.829
We all know sex sells in this country.

26:04.854 --> 26:07.954
Be it in magazines, movies, television.

26:08.005 --> 26:11.818
With the exception of course being
family-oriented fare like

26:11.858 --> 26:14.545
the Super Bowl where, I guess,
nudity has no place

26:14.585 --> 26:16.644
amongst the mud-wrestling
beer commercials

26:16.684 --> 26:18.036
or the ads for erectile dysfunction.

26:18.076 --> 26:22.576
But aside from that, we as a nation
heartily embrace sex,

26:22.607 --> 26:26.352
and all things sexual, as a
very effective means to an end,

26:26.392 --> 26:29.908
and sometimes the end is to sell a truck and
sometimes it's to impeach a president,

26:29.948 --> 26:32.424
or to get you to buy a ticket
or to just tune in.

26:32.464 --> 26:35.964
But in the end, we as a nation
are obsessed with sex,

26:36.001 --> 26:39.257
there's either too much of it or
we simply can't get enough.

26:39.297 --> 26:42.997
And personally, well,
Your Honor knows I'm a fan.

26:43.042 --> 26:45.614
Even when I watch the news,
the more sordid, the better.

26:45.654 --> 26:48.854
Sex triangles in space. Anna Nicole.

26:48.884 --> 26:53.405
Never mind a little war in Iraq, we wanna know
who the father of that woman's child is.

26:53.445 --> 26:54.967
After all, she posed naked in Playboy!

26:55.007 --> 26:57.331
Mr Shore! The case at hand. Please!

26:57.371 --> 26:58.995
The case at hand.

26:59.085 --> 27:01.034
What makes this case
different, Your Honor,

27:01.074 --> 27:05.674
is that with these little prostitots
they're celebrating promiscuity,

27:05.739 --> 27:08.672
declaring it's neat to
be a trampy little slut.

27:08.712 --> 27:11.352
But they're saying it to kids! Children.

27:11.353 --> 27:14.553
My client's daughter is six years old.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.189
She's their targeted consumer.

27:16.229 --> 27:19.463
And for a store or manufacturer
to lay it off on,

27:19.495 --> 27:23.895
“Gee! It's today's culture!” is as
irresponsible as it is obscene.

27:23.895 --> 27:28.134
Our country may have degenerated to
the point where people like Paris Hilton

27:28.174 --> 27:32.093
can make celebrities of themselves
by having rather pedestrian,

27:32.133 --> 27:34.298
and I must say lackluster,
intercourse on the internet!

27:34.338 --> 27:39.495
Or Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan may fuel
their fame with finely waxed crotch shots

27:39.535 --> 27:43.335
and random behavior that's
worthy of, well, drug addicts.

27:43.404 --> 27:47.113
But when our culture rewards them
for it, or more importantly,

27:47.153 --> 27:49.726
when age compression marketing
pushes this whole,

27:49.766 --> 27:55.043
“Lets be a whore” idea on elementary school
children, culture needs an adjustment.

27:55.083 --> 27:58.977
But until then, lucky for Lindsay
and Britney, they have you.

27:59.017 --> 28:01.463
I love your glibness, Jerry, keep it up.

28:01.503 --> 28:04.178
Perhaps you can truly distract
the Judge from the fact

28:04.218 --> 28:06.463
that when fourth graders
feel pressured to wear

28:06.503 --> 28:09.703
belly skimming shirts
and low riding jeans,

28:09.782 --> 28:13.292
it's often the first step in a
depressing cycle of preadolescent

28:13.332 --> 28:15.629
and teenage dysfunction
that can compromise

28:15.669 --> 28:18.269
both their mental and physical health.

28:18.283 --> 28:20.527
But what the hell? The dolls sell!

28:57.520 --> 28:59.732
I think these dolls are despicable.

28:59.772 --> 29:03.402
But drawing the line here
would strike me as arbitrary.

29:03.403 --> 29:05.703
I mean, what's new?

29:05.711 --> 29:09.011
Twenty-five years ago
Madonna rode her sexual,

29:09.119 --> 29:11.110
raunchy, promiscuity to iconic status.

29:11.150 --> 29:13.646
The country, and I believe
feminism, celebrated her.

29:13.686 --> 29:16.286
Paris Hilton might have
intercourse on the internet,

29:16.326 --> 29:19.376
but our most prominent
actresses routinely simulate

29:19.416 --> 29:22.129
sex acts on seventy millimeter
at a theatre near you.

29:22.169 --> 29:26.469
Sometimes they get Oscars for it.

29:26.522 --> 29:31.322
I suppose you could draw
the line with these dolls,

29:31.420 --> 29:35.120
but how about
the clothing stores that

29:35.131 --> 29:38.231
sell sweat pants with
“Juicy” on the butts?

29:38.241 --> 29:40.557
What about the T-shirts
that say, “Do me”?

29:40.597 --> 29:43.997
What about the sexually
explicit music videos

29:44.002 --> 29:46.119
and television shows
that target the tweens.

29:46.159 --> 29:49.452
And if we really wanna crack down
on the sexualization of our minors,

29:49.492 --> 29:51.699
we might consider their role models.

29:51.739 --> 29:55.139
Our female CEOs and
lawyers and doctors,

29:55.209 --> 29:58.144
women of real power who
routinely get boob jobs

29:58.184 --> 30:00.389
just to feel better about themselves.

30:00.429 --> 30:01.835
And what about the mothers,
many of whom

30:01.875 --> 30:04.875
wear the low-cut jeans
and the midriffs?

30:04.924 --> 30:07.342
How dare he?

30:09.379 --> 30:11.508
Are you a parent, Mr Espenson?

30:11.559 --> 30:13.566
No, Your Honor.

30:13.641 --> 30:17.441
It is my most profound hope
that one day I shall be.

30:17.563 --> 30:21.418
Do you think that you would
stand before me as a father

30:21.528 --> 30:25.928
of a young girl and say that
these dolls don't trouble you?

30:25.952 --> 30:27.793
No.

30:27.833 --> 30:29.633
They bother me now.

30:29.724 --> 30:31.724
But it's nothing new.

30:31.802 --> 30:33.624
We're always gonna
worry about our kids,

30:33.664 --> 30:36.051
thinking in today's world
they've got no chance.

30:36.091 --> 30:39.919
But the reality is, Your Honor,
rates of teenage drinking,

30:40.078 --> 30:41.856
smoking and drug use are declining.

30:41.896 --> 30:44.802
Teen pregnancy rates are
down 35% from 1990,

30:44.842 --> 30:46.754
many teens are abstaining from sex.

30:46.794 --> 30:51.071
And most see Britney Spears and
Lindsay Lohan for exactly what they are.

30:51.111 --> 30:54.959
Young woman now earn 57%
of all Bachelor's degrees,

30:54.999 --> 30:56.847
59% of all Master's degrees.

30:56.861 --> 30:58.630
Congress now has 90 female members,

30:58.670 --> 31:01.870
including the Speaker of the House.

31:01.875 --> 31:04.195
I don't think we're doomed, just yet.

31:04.235 --> 31:05.904
And should doom ever come,

31:05.944 --> 31:09.442
I doubt very much it will
be brought about by a doll.

31:27.900 --> 31:29.304
Shirley.

31:29.327 --> 31:30.383
What's going on?

31:30.467 --> 31:32.130
What are all the managing
partners doing in there?

31:32.170 --> 31:34.259
We're about to have a meeting.

31:34.264 --> 31:35.349
Why wasn't I notified?

31:35.389 --> 31:36.668
Because you're not invited.

31:36.708 --> 31:37.706
But I have a right to be in there.

31:37.746 --> 31:39.351
And don't tell me
this doesn't involve me.

31:39.391 --> 31:40.543
I'm a named partner!

31:40.583 --> 31:44.345
It very much involves you,
Denny, and you're not invited.

31:50.696 --> 31:51.565
Alright. What?

31:51.605 --> 31:52.803
Shirley. It's time.

31:52.843 --> 31:54.735
This will be a media storm
we won't weather.

31:54.775 --> 31:56.714
I'm meeting with the press
this afternoon.

31:56.754 --> 31:59.327
It can't wait. Denny needs
to be removed now! Or—

31:59.367 --> 32:03.545
All in favor of Denny being removed
say, “Aye.” Show of hands.

32:07.223 --> 32:09.841
The “Nays” have it.

32:30.505 --> 32:36.244
What the…

32:36.414 --> 32:37.460
Do you see what's going on out there?

32:37.500 --> 32:38.490
Has it started?

32:38.529 --> 32:40.739
No. But it's a circus.

32:40.779 --> 32:42.638
Brad, can I talk to you for a second?

32:42.678 --> 32:43.621
Oh, oh.

32:43.647 --> 32:47.084
Uhm. Do you think it's safe
for me to go out there?

32:47.124 --> 32:50.232
Denny, unless you have a good
disguise, I'm going to guess, no!

32:50.272 --> 32:52.384
But they'll be talking about me.

33:00.650 --> 33:02.568
So, what do you wanna talk about?

33:02.608 --> 33:06.548
Um.

33:06.633 --> 33:12.233
I have occasioned myself to
ask whether I really love you.

33:12.263 --> 33:14.363
Deeply enough to marry you.

33:14.411 --> 33:19.361
More simply put, “Would I marry you
if we weren't having a child together?”

33:20.529 --> 33:26.229
Part of it may be because I
have a tendency to look at you

33:26.296 --> 33:27.776
through other people's eyes

33:27.816 --> 33:31.716
and see you as this giant goofhead.

33:31.778 --> 33:36.278
But when I look at you
through my eyes only,

33:36.302 --> 33:42.102
and my heart, I realize… I do love you!

33:42.161 --> 33:44.161
Quite deeply.

33:44.235 --> 33:47.935
And I can't wait to be your wife.

33:49.553 --> 33:51.753
That's all I wanna say.

33:52.192 --> 33:54.682
That is the best thing that anyone

33:54.683 --> 33:57.055
has ever said to me in my entire life.

33:57.095 --> 33:59.795
Including my Gunnery Sergeant,

33:59.882 --> 34:02.258
all my Little League coaches… Just…

34:21.753 --> 34:23.638
My name is Shirley Schmidt,

34:23.715 --> 34:26.540
I'm a senior partner at
Crane, Poole and Schmidt,

34:26.580 --> 34:28.480
thank you all for coming.

34:28.565 --> 34:32.150
It's nice to see you'll turn out
when there's hard news.

34:32.190 --> 34:34.154
Yesterday my partner, Denny Crane,

34:34.194 --> 34:36.371
made some regrettable statements,

34:36.474 --> 34:39.024
the most offensive being when he told an

34:39.063 --> 34:42.964
African-American law student
that he didn't sound black.

34:43.034 --> 34:44.534
I know Denny Crane.

34:44.585 --> 34:46.085
He is not a bigot.

34:46.170 --> 34:48.353
When he used the word ‘articulate’,

34:48.393 --> 34:51.194
as I suspect Joe Biden used it,

34:51.224 --> 34:54.623
as I suspect our President used it,

34:54.670 --> 34:56.527
what he was attempting to convey

34:56.568 --> 34:59.768
was that he thought
Mr Givens would play well

34:59.840 --> 35:02.340
with white corporate America.

35:02.383 --> 35:06.283
The simple but ugly truth
is we all look for that.

35:06.477 --> 35:10.277
Perhaps unconsciously,
perhaps not, but we do.

35:10.278 --> 35:12.786
We have a primarily white client base.

35:12.849 --> 35:16.849
We hire associates we feel
will best appeal to that base.

35:16.924 --> 35:19.224
Before you point your finger at us

35:19.264 --> 35:22.386
I would invite the media
to look at its own industry.

35:22.426 --> 35:25.732
Consider the criteria by which
you choose your anchors.

35:25.772 --> 35:28.781
Denny Crane's statement
speaks not to his own racism

35:28.821 --> 35:32.821
but to a much more
insidious one that exists in

35:32.836 --> 35:35.469
a white collar society that prefers

35:35.564 --> 35:38.964
to take its blacks as it takes its coffee,

35:39.007 --> 35:41.807
with a little cream and sugar.

35:41.882 --> 35:43.282
I'm not proud of it.

35:43.369 --> 35:45.869
But until we confront that truth,

35:45.947 --> 35:47.547
we will not change it.

35:47.607 --> 35:49.257
Thank you all for coming.

36:03.397 --> 36:05.710
I hate the dolls.

36:05.750 --> 36:08.671
But do they offend the sensibilities
of our society?

36:08.711 --> 36:11.554
One that broadcasts reality shows
about trading wives.

36:11.594 --> 36:14.194
One where the average child hears

36:14.281 --> 36:15.943
about erectile dysfunction before

36:15.983 --> 36:18.037
he's heard of Christopher Columbus.

36:18.077 --> 36:18.877
Your Honor.

36:18.884 --> 36:21.624
This ruling is not going
at all well, so far.

36:21.664 --> 36:22.753
One can only assume this

36:22.793 --> 36:25.185
preamble is a misdirect to add

36:25.206 --> 36:26.910
suspense to your ultimate decision

36:26.950 --> 36:30.202
which I know will be more just.

36:30.242 --> 36:31.986
You lose, Counsel.

36:32.017 --> 36:34.517
But I do hope you won't let your

36:34.557 --> 36:36.003
professional discomfiture with me

36:36.043 --> 36:38.043
affect your personal feelings.

36:38.120 --> 36:39.706
I'll try not to.

36:39.746 --> 36:42.704
Motion to dismiss, granted.

36:42.745 --> 36:44.008
I'm sorry, Kaye.

36:44.052 --> 36:45.964
You knew this was
most likely a loser, but…

36:46.004 --> 36:46.988
You tried.

36:47.008 --> 36:47.838
And I thank you for that.

36:47.878 --> 36:49.708
If it's any consolation,

36:49.757 --> 36:51.503
children are still the most
influenced by their parents,

36:51.543 --> 36:53.795
and your daughter seems to
be in very good hands there.

36:53.835 --> 36:56.985
Thank you..

36:59.680 --> 37:03.629
Jerry.

37:03.967 --> 37:05.867
I must tell you,

37:05.909 --> 37:09.011
that man with the wooden
cigarette in his mouth

37:09.046 --> 37:13.346
was brilliant.

37:13.403 --> 37:17.103
He might alienate a few
juries along the way.

37:17.105 --> 37:21.605
The man who gave the closing,
however, is perhaps

37:22.424 --> 37:28.176
one of the finest lawyers
I've ever been up against.

37:28.206 --> 37:30.420
Thank you.

37:30.526 --> 37:31.932
And for what it's worth,

37:31.972 --> 37:35.979
the man who gave the closing,

37:36.030 --> 37:40.630
I miss him, terribly.

37:40.665 --> 37:42.208
If you could see your way past—

37:42.248 --> 37:43.413
Okay.

37:43.573 --> 37:46.243
Just like that? Okay.

37:46.284 --> 37:48.564
I miss you, Alan.

38:01.654 --> 38:05.008
So, he took you back?

38:05.078 --> 38:08.593
I suppose you'll be going over to
his place for a sleepover tonight?

38:08.633 --> 38:10.477
Denny!

38:10.510 --> 38:11.391
And he beat you?

38:11.431 --> 38:13.759
He did.

38:13.781 --> 38:15.623
What's that like?

38:15.629 --> 38:16.829
To lose?

38:16.866 --> 38:19.359
You almost lost in a very
big way today, my friend.

38:19.399 --> 38:22.665
Oh, you should have seen Shirley.

38:22.690 --> 38:25.662
If anybody wonders how
she got to be Shirley Schmidt,

38:25.702 --> 38:28.802
the evidence was on full display today.

38:28.868 --> 38:31.768
She was as strong and as powerful

38:31.850 --> 38:34.400
and as dignified as
any woman I've ever seen.

38:34.440 --> 38:39.840
Made me wanna flip her on her
back and have sex with her.

38:39.894 --> 38:41.960
Do you think you're a racist, Denny?

38:42.000 --> 38:47.638
Oh… nah, I… I don't know.

38:47.721 --> 38:51.521
Do you think it's racist
to say a man sounds black?

38:51.600 --> 38:53.202
I think it's more offensive to say,

38:53.242 --> 38:57.342
‘street’ or ‘urban’, when the
inference is you mean ‘black’.

38:57.466 --> 38:59.575
So, what do you say?

38:59.639 --> 39:02.611
Well, Barack Obama referred
to the black sound

39:02.651 --> 39:08.551
as a black idiom, more like jazz
and less like a set score.

39:08.649 --> 39:10.113
They let him get away with that?

39:10.153 --> 39:13.571
Evidently.

39:13.597 --> 39:15.171
I might vote for him, you know.

39:15.211 --> 39:15.759
Obama?

39:15.805 --> 39:17.181
“Anybody in America can
grow up to be president!”

39:17.221 --> 39:22.721
That's what I say. Except
Hillary! She wins, I puke.

39:22.809 --> 39:23.841
Barack Obama.

39:23.888 --> 39:25.418
Ah. Handsome.

39:25.423 --> 39:26.823
Great photo-op.

39:26.896 --> 39:29.149
But I don't know what he stands for.

39:29.189 --> 39:30.707
Be a perfect president.

39:30.779 --> 39:33.779
He speaks perfect white,
as well as black.

39:33.817 --> 39:35.270
You never heard me say that.

39:35.310 --> 39:36.334
What about McCain?

39:36.374 --> 39:38.354
He speaks Bush now. Can't win.

39:38.474 --> 39:40.737
Obama is against the war now, you know.

39:40.777 --> 39:43.814
So am I. It's boring.

39:43.904 --> 39:45.048
I'm ready for a new war.

39:45.088 --> 39:46.488
Time to blow up Iran.

39:46.528 --> 39:48.572
They got Sadam.

39:48.632 --> 39:52.132
Now we gotta get uh…
Amina Douchebag.

39:52.215 --> 39:54.834
And that nut job in North Korea,
they both gotta go.

39:54.874 --> 39:58.174
And not because they're not white.

39:58.243 --> 40:00.401
Okay.

40:00.471 --> 40:02.132
Denny, does it bother you at all

40:02.172 --> 40:05.672
that America is so hated by the rest of the world these days?

40:05.712 --> 40:07.816
Well, of course it does, Alan.

40:07.911 --> 40:09.811
Just can't please everybody.

40:09.829 --> 40:10.929
Better to just…

40:10.962 --> 40:11.699
Blow them up.

40:11.739 --> 40:12.460
Exactly.

40:12.548 --> 40:14.690
And not because they're not white.

40:14.730 --> 40:17.354
No.
