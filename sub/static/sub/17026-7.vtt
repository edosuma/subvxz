After Vicks Cough Syrup with honey

02:07.399 --> 02:10.318
a coughing fit doesn't have to ruin
a beautiful moment.

02:10.318 --> 02:11.518
# Day once dawned

02:11.518 --> 02:14.438
So before an irritating cough
takes over your life,

02:14.438 --> 02:17.038
let long-lasting Vicks Cough Syrup
with honey

02:17.038 --> 02:19.198
soothe your throat
and calm your cough.

02:20.438 --> 02:23.038
Vicks. We start with solutions,
not problems

04:19.716 --> 04:21.397
Hello. I'm Eriq la Salle.
This past week,

04:21.557 --> 04:23.477
we lost the creator of our show,
Michael Crichton.

04:23.637 --> 04:25.317
He was a true gentleman,
gracious and witty,

04:25.477 --> 04:27.957
a brilliant writer, intelligent
and unfailingly kind.

04:28.077 --> 04:29.757
But most of all,
Michael was a good friend

04:29.877 --> 04:31.117
and we will miss him.

04:44.837 --> 04:46.637
RUSSELL:
Baby?

04:50.437 --> 04:52.317
Where are you?

05:08.837 --> 05:10.557
What are you
doing in here?

05:10.677 --> 05:12.477
I hate this wallpaper.

05:12.597 --> 05:14.437
We'll redo it.

05:16.037 --> 05:17.797
I don't know what you were
thinking last night,

05:17.917 --> 05:19.677
talking about that.

05:19.797 --> 05:21.516
It was a dinner party,

05:21.516 --> 05:22.876
I didn't pick
the topic.
Well, you certainly

05:23.036 --> 05:25.036
didn't hesitate
to dive right in.

05:25.036 --> 05:27.356
Maybe that's because you won't
talk about it when we're alone.

05:34.156 --> 05:36.276
You think I blame you
for what happened?

05:36.436 --> 05:39.956
You think I'd still be here
if I did?

05:39.956 --> 05:44.756
I try not to worry
about who you blame.

05:44.756 --> 05:46.436
No offence, but living
with a teenage boy

05:46.596 --> 05:47.716
is like living with
a barn animal.

05:47.876 --> 05:49.276
Only, cows make
better conversations.

05:49.436 --> 05:51.516
Butt abscess -
needs dressing.

05:51.676 --> 05:53.116
Well, at least a cow's
not a predator.

05:53.276 --> 05:54.716
Sarah's friends are
like a pack of she-wolves

05:54.836 --> 05:56.476
with cell phones.

05:56.476 --> 05:58.316
Look, a new one
just for you -

05:58.316 --> 05:59.796
anal warts.

05:59.916 --> 06:01.556
This is so ass.

06:01.556 --> 06:03.476
Looks like the Gates-Taggart
merger's in full swing.

06:03.636 --> 06:05.196
You mean the Brady Bunch
from hell?

06:05.356 --> 06:06.996
No, actually it's going great,
but she'll never admit it.

06:07.116 --> 06:08.236
Really? OK.

06:08.396 --> 06:10.076
He's never been happier.
He just loves to complain.

06:10.196 --> 06:11.516
This much we know.

06:11.716 --> 06:13.076
What's that supposed
to mean?
Sorry?

06:13.236 --> 06:14.956
The VA sent these
records over,

06:15.076 --> 06:16.156
and some guy called

06:16.156 --> 06:17.516
from the Wounded
Warriors' Project.

06:17.676 --> 06:18.756
What's that
all about?

06:18.756 --> 06:19.876
Is the ladies'
room this way?

06:20.036 --> 06:21.076
Uh, yes, ma'am.
It's down the hall,

06:21.236 --> 06:22.556
and to the left.
Thank you, dear.

06:22.676 --> 06:23.836
Hey, is Banfield on?

06:23.996 --> 06:24.996
She should be
in soon.

06:25.236 --> 06:26.436
Is that about
our homeless vet?
Yeah.

06:26.596 --> 06:28.396
What's the story?
I'm gonna figure it out.

06:29.796 --> 06:30.916
Hey, uh, Bertha,

06:31.076 --> 06:32.516
Bertha, this is
not a good time!

06:32.676 --> 06:33.996
Whoa, go get her, big boy.
Bertha!

06:34.156 --> 06:36.516
And Hoberman's waiting
on a cholecystectomy.

06:36.516 --> 06:39.436
Uh, hey, when are you gonna
clear out all these boarders?

06:39.436 --> 06:40.796
We're working
on it, Sam.

06:40.796 --> 06:42.316
In the meantime,
you might want to get more

06:42.316 --> 06:44.516
than one intern down here
doing your babysitting.

06:44.516 --> 06:45.876
How's Dr Wade managing?

06:45.876 --> 06:47.836
The customers seem
satisfied.
Yeah?

06:47.836 --> 06:49.556
What about you?
Are you satisfied?

06:49.556 --> 06:50.796
I need to loosen up a bit.

06:50.796 --> 06:52.196
I have a tendency
to micromanage.

06:52.316 --> 06:53.796
Yeah, Cate mentioned that.

06:53.916 --> 06:54.956
Cate who?

06:54.956 --> 06:56.276
Dr Banfield.

06:56.436 --> 06:57.715
You know, the department
head coffee klatch.

06:57.835 --> 06:58.955
Oh, great.

06:59.115 --> 07:01.635
You know, autonomy is a
fine teaching device, Neela.

07:01.795 --> 07:04.035
Let's just make sure
it doesn't lead to slowness

07:04.155 --> 07:05.915
or distraction, OK?

07:06.035 --> 07:07.595
You guys ready? Good.

07:07.715 --> 07:09.195
Ready to round.

07:09.315 --> 07:10.475
Where's your intern?

07:10.635 --> 07:12.035
When are you going
to get me a real bed

07:12.195 --> 07:13.315
in a real room?
Uh, soon.

07:13.435 --> 07:14.595
Uh, we're a little backed up.

07:14.755 --> 07:16.675
I was meant to go under
the knife yesterday -

07:16.835 --> 07:19.435
so I haven't had anything to
eat but some Jim Jones juice

07:19.595 --> 07:21.155
and Jell-o
that made my poop red.

07:21.275 --> 07:22.795
Red? Wait, you mean...

07:22.875 --> 07:23.875
Now this?

07:24.035 --> 07:25.875
The mattress is made of cement

07:26.035 --> 07:29.435
and I've seen airport runways
that were less noisy.

07:29.555 --> 07:31.315
Am I smudged?

07:31.435 --> 07:33.675
Uh...just a little.

07:33.795 --> 07:35.275
Hello?

07:35.395 --> 07:36.635
What are you doing?

07:36.755 --> 07:38.715
Mmm.

07:42.595 --> 07:44.995
(PANTING)

07:45.115 --> 07:46.395
Oh, God.

07:46.515 --> 07:47.515
Hey.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.475
I'm in the middle of my run.

07:49.595 --> 07:51.355
We can talk about this later.

07:51.475 --> 07:53.115
No, I'm not, it's just that...

07:53.235 --> 07:54.235
SIRENS WAILING

07:54.395 --> 07:56.195
Listen, I got to go now,
Russell.

07:57.155 --> 07:59.035
No, no, no, no, no, no.

08:00.275 --> 08:02.195
Nina!

08:02.195 --> 08:03.435
Nina! Nina!

08:03.435 --> 08:04.395

08:04.515 --> 08:06.275

08:06.395 --> 08:08.995

their best-value

10:53.073 --> 10:54.393

11:03.993 --> 11:05.913

recyclable.

11:12.753 --> 11:14.713
It's engineered to be so efficient,

11:14.793 --> 11:16.273
it can run on a quarter of the power

11:16.393 --> 11:18.673
of a single light bulb.

11:18.753 --> 11:20.073
And it's made without

11:20.153 --> 11:22.233
some environmentally harmful toxins,

11:22.313 --> 11:24.273
like mercury.

the most famous.

12:11.312 --> 12:13.512
So, if we're going
to get your attention,

12:13.632 --> 12:15.552
we need to work
twice as hard.

That's not so bad.

13:24.111 --> 13:25.111
That's just the ER.

13:25.271 --> 13:26.191
We have 40 more

13:26.351 --> 13:27.591
OK, right,
67-year-old woman

13:27.791 --> 13:29.311
presents with
neck mass...
Oh, God, with the age again.

13:29.471 --> 13:30.951
..and dysphagia.
Dys-what?

13:31.111 --> 13:32.551
Uh, pain on
swallowing.

13:32.711 --> 13:35.471
Saying it fancy doesn't make you
seem smarter, Andrew.

13:35.591 --> 13:37.391
It makes you seem insecure.

13:37.551 --> 13:38.831
It's a shorthand
doctors use,

13:38.951 --> 13:40.671
to save us time.

13:40.671 --> 13:42.071
Yes, in theory.

13:42.231 --> 13:44.831
Uh, her son initially
noticed the mass

13:44.831 --> 13:46.071
about three months ago
when she visited him

13:46.231 --> 13:47.711
in Michigan.
Ann Arbor.

13:47.871 --> 13:48.871
He's a professor
at the university there.

13:48.991 --> 13:50.031
Oh.

13:50.191 --> 13:51.191
A fine needle
aspiration

13:51.351 --> 13:53.151
showed a degenerative,
albeit benign, cyst,

13:53.311 --> 13:54.391
but thyroidectomy
is still indicated

13:54.551 --> 13:55.791
for symptomatic
relief.

13:55.951 --> 13:57.471
All right, that's thorough.

13:57.631 --> 13:58.751
Next?
Review of systems

14:00.391 --> 14:02.111

Dr Wade.

14:02.231 --> 14:03.311
That's what we're here for.

14:03.311 --> 14:04.311

14:04.471 --> 14:06.191
Uh, no palpitations,
diaphoresis,

14:06.311 --> 14:07.391
heat intolerance.

14:07.391 --> 14:08.631
However...
Her TSH is normal

14:08.751 --> 14:09.751
so we know there's no

14:09.911 --> 14:11.351
hyperthyroidism,
right?

14:11.351 --> 14:12.351
Right, but there is...
OK, then.

I was out for a run
and saw the rescue team.
Stroller blew

14:24.471 --> 14:25.671
into the lake, took almost
20 minutes to find the girl.

14:25.831 --> 14:27.271
20 minutes? She was under
water that whole time?

14:27.391 --> 14:29.071
Mi nieta estaba muy
inquieta en la casa,

14:29.191 --> 14:30.151
asi que la lleve a pasear.

14:30.311 --> 14:31.351
Grandpa took
her on a walk

14:31.351 --> 14:33.111
cos she was
acting fussy.

14:33.111 --> 14:34.431
Todo estaba bien.
estaba feliz...

14:34.431 --> 14:35.751
Everything was good,
she was happy.

14:35.751 --> 14:37.791
..y de repente
ya no la vi.

14:37.951 --> 14:39.751
And then the baby
was just gone.

14:39.871 --> 14:41.431
Go deep, go!

14:41.431 --> 14:43.351
Go! go! go! go! go!

it a Hail Mary.

14:54.030 --> 14:55.070

14:55.070 --> 14:57.630
You didn't chase me.

14:57.790 --> 14:59.510

14:59.630 --> 15:01.430

15:10.670 --> 15:12.550
'What's your plan, Dr Martin?
She has a pulse.'

15:12.550 --> 15:14.230
Not much to do but warm
her up and wait.
Right. So?

15:14.350 --> 15:15.510
Access, warm saline

15:15.670 --> 15:17.190
and get respiratory
down here with a vent.

15:17.310 --> 15:18.390
Get the Bair Hugger

15:18.390 --> 15:19.390

15:19.390 --> 15:20.510

a favour to ask.
Not now.

15:22.030 --> 15:23.350
I need your help

15:23.350 --> 15:25.070

indication, call
the radiologist.

15:25.230 --> 15:27.230
It's not exactly an emergency,
but it needs to happen today.

Let Neuro work it out.

15:32.230 --> 15:33.670
Well, I tried that,
but they said they want him

15:33.790 --> 15:35.470
to come back as an outpatient,
which is never gonna happen.

15:35.470 --> 15:38.150
He's not an ER patient any more -
it's out of our hands.

15:38.270 --> 15:39.870
He was in Iraq.

15:39.990 --> 15:42.590
A war hero.

15:42.750 --> 15:44.710
Served in the same unit as I did
back in Desert Storm.

15:44.710 --> 15:46.910
I hear the harmonica
playing, Dr Gates,

15:47.070 --> 15:48.870
but work is work and
the rest is irrelevant.

15:49.070 --> 15:51.830
Dr Banfield, I get this
whole tough boss thing,

15:51.990 --> 15:53.390
and it works for you,
it really does,

15:53.510 --> 15:55.670
but cut me some slack.

15:55.790 --> 15:56.750
I need your help.

16:01.430 --> 16:03.430
Dr Banfield, the old ball
and chain on line two.

16:03.550 --> 16:04.950
Thank you.

16:05.070 --> 16:07.350
Tell him I'm in with
a patient, Frank.

16:08.310 --> 16:10.790
I'll call him later.

16:14.470 --> 16:16.270
Max Gonzalez,

16:16.390 --> 16:18.710
sergeant first class.

16:18.710 --> 16:21.110
You figured out who I am, huh?

16:21.270 --> 16:22.989
Mm-hmm.
101st Airborne,

16:23.109 --> 16:26.069
1st Squadron, 75th Cav.

16:27.349 --> 16:29.149
Yeah.

16:29.269 --> 16:30.389
Yeah, that's right.

16:30.549 --> 16:31.869
They called us the
widowmakers.

16:32.029 --> 16:34.269
So you remember it?

16:34.269 --> 16:36.789
My memory's a work
in progress.

16:36.909 --> 16:38.149
But it's getting better.

16:38.149 --> 16:39.149
So thanks for that.

16:39.309 --> 16:40.749
Don't you want
to hear more?

16:40.749 --> 16:42.029
Not really.

16:42.189 --> 16:43.909
Awarded a silver star
in '06,

16:44.069 --> 16:45.509
later wounded
in a rocket attack

16:45.669 --> 16:46.709
killed a bunch
of your buddies.

16:46.829 --> 16:48.349
Doctors documented
altered behaviour -

16:48.349 --> 16:49.949
anger, depression,
hostility.

16:50.149 --> 16:51.829
They gave me
some pills.
Yeah, SSRIS -

16:51.989 --> 16:53.629
antidepressants.
Didn't help much.

16:53.789 --> 16:54.909
Then they discharged
you on a 5-13.

16:55.069 --> 16:56.029
Do you remember
what that is?

16:56.149 --> 16:57.869
Yeah.

16:57.869 --> 16:59.229
It meant that I could go home.

16:59.429 --> 17:02.229
No, it meant the army
could stop giving
you medical care,

17:02.229 --> 17:03.829
stop being responsible
for you.
It meant I could get the hell

17:03.949 --> 17:05.189
out of there!

17:05.189 --> 17:06.709
Because they said you had
a personality disorder.

17:06.868 --> 17:07.829
They said that you
had something wrong

17:07.989 --> 17:08.949
with your brain
before you enlisted.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.069
Maybe there was -

17:10.229 --> 17:11.429
that's what my old man
always said.

17:11.549 --> 17:13.429
What if there wasn't?

17:13.429 --> 17:15.388
What if it was a lie?

17:15.388 --> 17:16.669
Your symptoms are
consistent

17:16.829 --> 17:18.749
with traumatic brain
injury - TBI -

17:18.949 --> 17:21.029
something you easily
could have suffered
when that rocket hit.

17:21.148 --> 17:23.029
So you're saying what?

17:23.029 --> 17:24.348
They dumped me?

17:24.509 --> 17:26.229
I'm saying I think
they missed it,

17:26.388 --> 17:27.749
mistreated it and
sent you packing

17:27.909 --> 17:29.149
for the cheapest
possible price.

17:31.149 --> 17:32.949
I wanted out, Doc.

17:33.069 --> 17:34.469
Trust me, I wanted out.

17:34.629 --> 17:36.389
Max, you needed out,
but not like this.

17:36.509 --> 17:38.269
I don't want to be here.

17:38.389 --> 17:39.789
I don't like it here.

17:39.989 --> 17:42.949
I know how it is to come back
from a war and feel adrift.

17:44.909 --> 17:46.709
Max,

17:46.869 --> 17:48.669
just give me a couple of
hours to help you.

17:51.469 --> 17:52.949
Tube's in.

17:53.109 --> 17:54.869
Get pharmacy to send down
more warm saline,

17:54.989 --> 17:56.229
as much as they've got.

17:56.229 --> 17:58.268
ABG's back.
She's acidotic - 7.22.

17:58.428 --> 18:00.188
Should we use a
high vent rate?

18:00.348 --> 18:01.908
The mother's out here.

18:01.908 --> 18:03.828
Someone should probably
talk to her first.

18:04.908 --> 18:07.068
Dr Morris,
update the family.

18:07.068 --> 18:08.748
I kind of have my
hands full here.

18:08.868 --> 18:09.948
Dr Martin.

18:09.948 --> 18:11.948
OK, but, uh,
shouldn't you?

18:12.108 --> 18:13.308
I mean, she is
your patient, right?

18:13.428 --> 18:14.548
What's the CO2?

18:14.548 --> 18:15.668
Forty.

18:15.788 --> 18:17.548
Standard rate.

18:17.708 --> 18:20.468
The pH might normalise
as we get the temp up.

18:20.588 --> 18:22.348
Hello.

18:22.468 --> 18:23.748
You're the mom?

18:23.908 --> 18:25.628
Sandra Herrero.
Is my daughter OK?

18:25.748 --> 18:26.988
It's hard to know yet.

18:27.148 --> 18:28.748
We're trying
to warm her up now.

18:28.908 --> 18:30.708
She's very strong
for her age,

18:30.828 --> 18:32.588
and she's a good girl,

18:32.708 --> 18:35.028
very sweet, so...

18:35.148 --> 18:36.468
She'll be OK?

18:39.828 --> 18:41.628
We're just waiting to see.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.948
Please, I know you know,
so tell me.

18:45.148 --> 18:46.868
Is my baby gonna
be all right?

18:47.028 --> 18:49.668
RUSSELL:
'Why can't you ever give
a straight answer?'

18:49.668 --> 18:51.268
Mmm.

18:51.388 --> 18:53.188
(LAUGHS)

18:53.308 --> 18:55.588
You want to have a baby?

18:55.668 --> 18:56.708
Another baby?

18:56.708 --> 18:57.748
Now?

18:57.908 --> 18:59.228
Well, not right
now, but...

18:59.348 --> 19:00.588
Excuse me,

19:00.788 --> 19:02.628
is this your son?
There's something
wrong with him.

19:02.628 --> 19:04.068
Daryl?

19:04.228 --> 19:05.828
What?
Daryl!

19:05.948 --> 19:07.108
Daryl!

19:08.348 --> 19:09.948
It's happening again.
OK, OK, baby.

19:10.148 --> 19:11.588
We should call
an ambulance?
No, no, I'm a doctor.

19:11.588 --> 19:12.508
WOMAN:
He doesn't look good.

19:12.628 --> 19:13.668
All right, he's burning up.

19:13.668 --> 19:14.748
It's just a febrile seizure.

19:14.908 --> 19:16.148
We should get him home
and cool him down.

19:16.268 --> 19:17.268
Maybe...maybe we should be safe.

19:17.428 --> 19:19.308
No, no, it's just
like last time.

19:19.428 --> 19:20.748
Look, it's stopping already.

19:20.908 --> 19:22.828
(ECHOING)
Are you sure?

19:24.308 --> 19:25.708
I've been doing this too long

19:25.868 --> 19:27.788
to make any promises,
but I'll tell you this.

19:27.948 --> 19:29.748
Losing control
is not going to help her,

19:29.908 --> 19:32.028
so if that's what you got
to do, you do it outside.

19:32.187 --> 19:33.227
In here,

19:33.387 --> 19:35.707
you be the mom, you be calm,
you put all your energy

19:35.707 --> 19:36.907
into helping your little girl
fight back

19:37.027 --> 19:38.307
because that's what she needs.

19:41.147 --> 19:42.427
Can I...

19:42.547 --> 19:44.787
can I go be with her now?

19:47.267 --> 19:48.907
Yes.

19:57.347 --> 19:58.627
We've still got
seven boarders down here.

19:58.627 --> 19:59.707
Cate's gonna kill me

19:59.707 --> 20:00.907
if we don't clear
them out soon.

20:01.027 --> 20:02.107
Yes, she is.

20:02.107 --> 20:03.187
How long is this
gonna go on?

20:03.347 --> 20:04.787
You people are practically
living down here.

20:04.947 --> 20:06.027
And by "you people,"
you mean...?

20:06.187 --> 20:07.507
Surgeons.
Of course.

20:07.507 --> 20:08.587
We're trying
to clear our overflow

20:08.747 --> 20:09.787
as quickly
as possible.

20:09.787 --> 20:11.187
TAGGART:
Mrs Mendenhall is crashing.

20:11.307 --> 20:12.787
Well, that's one way.

20:12.907 --> 20:14.507
TAGGART:
BP down to 60 palp.

20:14.627 --> 20:16.467
She's got a massive GI bleed.

20:16.467 --> 20:18.547
DUBENKO:
Saline wide open
on pressure bags.

20:18.707 --> 20:21.587
Prep for a central line,
two units on the rapid infuser.

20:21.747 --> 20:22.867
Let's go.
How's her airway?

20:22.867 --> 20:24.507
TAGGART:
Not that great,
even on 100%.

20:24.587 --> 20:25.827
Tube her, Neela.

20:25.987 --> 20:27.347
Hey, did she complain
of abdominal pain?

20:27.347 --> 20:28.307
No.
BANFIELD:
Any history

20:28.307 --> 20:29.347
of blood per rectum?

20:29.347 --> 20:30.947
Um, no, not so far as I know.

20:30.947 --> 20:32.187
RASGOTRA:
Suction's on high.

20:32.347 --> 20:33.267
DUBENKO:
OK.

20:33.427 --> 20:34.587
DUBENKO:
Call GI - she goes to Endoscopy

20:34.787 --> 20:36.147
if we get her pressure up.
TAGGART:
Lost the pulse.

20:36.307 --> 20:39.467
Ah, damn it.
Starting compressions.

20:39.467 --> 20:40.747
Dr Banfield,
our frozen girl

20:40.907 --> 20:41.907
is having runs
of V tach.

20:42.067 --> 20:43.227
ALVARADO:
I've got the amiodarone.

20:43.387 --> 20:45.307
OK, give 75 milligrams
and set up an infusion.

20:45.467 --> 20:46.467
TRACY:
Got it.

20:46.467 --> 20:47.947
BP's 67/32.

20:48.107 --> 20:50.027
Valecia's temperature
has dropped a little.

20:50.027 --> 20:51.027
We're working on that.
SANDRA:
Dropped?

20:51.187 --> 20:52.587
It's supposed to go up.
You said...

20:52.787 --> 20:54.427
I said to stay calm.
I'm stepping
up rewarming

20:54.427 --> 20:55.467
with some pleural lavage.

20:55.467 --> 20:56.747
You see that?

20:56.747 --> 20:57.987
Yeah.
Huh?

20:58.187 --> 20:59.547
How are the coags?
ALVARADO:
Not back yet.

20:59.707 --> 21:00.707
Do we have a
platelet count?

21:00.867 --> 21:02.787
Specimen clotted -
we had to send it in again.

21:02.947 --> 21:04.267
We should not have
to wait an hour

21:04.427 --> 21:05.387
for trauma labs.
Forget it.

21:05.547 --> 21:06.627
We'll give platelets
and FFP empirically.

21:06.746 --> 21:07.786
Why do we have to fight

21:07.946 --> 21:09.026
the same battles
every damn day?

21:09.946 --> 21:11.226
Go on, do it.

21:11.346 --> 21:13.066
(SIGHS)

23:35.625 --> 23:37.145
That's what you have to be

23:37.145 --> 23:38.385
to be world class.

23:40.185 --> 23:41.225
Every day is a chance

23:41.225 --> 23:42.465
to be at the top of your game.

23:44.065 --> 23:46.065
Achieving your goals.

23:48.625 --> 23:50.425
Gives you that inner confidence.

23:50.425 --> 23:52.465
Fusion Power has 5 blades

23:52.465 --> 23:54.385
spaced closer together

23:54.385 --> 23:55.585
for more comfort.

23:55.585 --> 23:57.225
You'll barely feel the blades.

23:57.225 --> 23:58.865
Experience Gillette's best shave ever

23:59.545 --> 24:01.625
Be phenomenal.

24:43.024 --> 24:45.464
# "Blowin' In The Wind"
by Bob Dylan

24:45.584 --> 24:50.384
# How many roads
must a man walk down

24:50.464 --> 24:54.424
# Before you call him a man?

24:56.264 --> 25:00.984
# How many seas
must a white dove sail

25:01.064 --> 25:05.504
# Before she sleeps in the sand?

25:06.344 --> 25:11.264
# Yes, 'n' how many years
can a mountain exist

25:12.144 --> 25:15.784
# Before it is washed to the sea?

25:17.384 --> 25:22.464
# The answer, my friend,
is blowin' in the wind

25:23.104 --> 25:26.784
# The answer is blowin' in the wind

25:26.864 --> 25:28.424
From community projects

25:28.504 --> 25:30.264
to a share of the profits.

25:30.344 --> 25:32.184
Renewable energy...

25:32.264 --> 25:34.144
to Fairtrade products.

25:34.264 --> 25:37.464
The Co-operative believe that
when the benefits are passed around

25:37.584 --> 25:39.624
it's good
for everyone.

26:45.223 --> 26:46.623
Another epi - it's
time for another epi.

26:46.823 --> 26:47.903
No, it won't
do any good.

26:47.903 --> 26:48.903
What about the
GI consult?

26:49.063 --> 26:50.543
They won't scope a
patient without a pulse.

26:50.663 --> 26:51.743
Dopamine?

26:51.743 --> 26:53.063
She's had eight units
packed cells,

26:53.223 --> 26:54.463
two units FFP.

26:54.623 --> 26:56.183
We've replaced her entire
blood volume twice.

26:56.343 --> 26:57.383
If the heart
could come back,

26:57.383 --> 26:58.423
it would have
by now.

26:58.583 --> 26:59.503
We're done.
Uh-uh.

26:59.623 --> 27:01.663
We're done.

27:01.783 --> 27:04.663
Two, three, four...

27:05.903 --> 27:07.023
FLATLINE TONE

27:14.623 --> 27:16.383
11.58am.

27:16.543 --> 27:18.383
Any relatives?
A son.

27:18.583 --> 27:21.583
Sorry?
She said she had a son
in Michigan.

27:21.583 --> 27:23.623
I'll call him.

27:23.743 --> 27:24.863
OK.

27:25.023 --> 27:27.543
I'll get started on the
paperwork for the coroner.

27:32.742 --> 27:34.862
Could you get...

27:35.022 --> 27:37.502
could you get me a
death kit, please?

27:37.702 --> 27:40.142
I can take care
of that for...
Please.

27:40.302 --> 27:42.222
Pull the curtain
behind you.

28:01.182 --> 28:02.422
I'm sorry.

28:05.782 --> 28:07.302
I'm sorry.

28:08.182 --> 28:09.182
No, tomorrow is
not good enough.

28:09.182 --> 28:10.022
She needs it now.

28:10.142 --> 28:11.222
What's the holdup?

28:11.222 --> 28:13.142
There's no ECMO unit
in the hospital.

28:13.262 --> 28:14.342
What? That can't be.

28:14.342 --> 28:15.422
County only
has two machines.

28:15.582 --> 28:17.582
One's in use, the other's
out for repairs.

28:17.742 --> 28:19.662
Systolic's down to 44.

28:19.822 --> 28:21.542
Valecia needs
a machine

28:21.662 --> 28:22.742
that will warm her blood

28:22.742 --> 28:24.342
and do the work
of her heart and lungs.

28:24.462 --> 28:25.462
We don't have that here,

28:25.622 --> 28:26.782
so we're gonna have
to transfer her

28:26.902 --> 28:27.942
to another hospital.

28:27.942 --> 28:29.022
Move her?

28:29.222 --> 28:30.342
What?
It'll take hours
for another hospital

28:30.502 --> 28:32.062
to accept her
and then a transport team

28:32.062 --> 28:34.262
to pick her up.
Yes, time is critical,
so let's not waste it.

28:34.382 --> 28:35.422
Call transport - go.

28:35.422 --> 28:37.462
This girl's not stable enough.

28:37.462 --> 28:38.782
Let's increase
internal rewarming,

28:38.942 --> 28:40.142
get the heart
in better shape

28:40.302 --> 28:41.302
before we ship
her out.

28:41.302 --> 28:42.382
She still has a pulse and BP.

28:42.502 --> 28:43.542
Now is our window.

28:43.542 --> 28:45.382
Dr Banfield, she's here now.

28:45.502 --> 28:46.782
We got to work

28:46.902 --> 28:48.422
with what we have.

28:48.622 --> 28:50.182
BANFIELD:
'We don't need to go
to the hospital.'

28:50.342 --> 28:51.502
RUSSELL:
You don't know that.

28:51.662 --> 28:52.782
He's groggy.

28:52.902 --> 28:53.862
He's postictal.

28:54.022 --> 28:55.302
Just like what happened
the other time.

28:55.422 --> 28:56.502
That wasn't the same.

28:56.502 --> 28:57.622
He was fine
in ten minutes.

28:57.702 --> 28:58.822
He had a full workup.

28:58.982 --> 29:00.622
He stayed overnight,
spinal tap, CT...

29:00.702 --> 29:01.702
You're not being objective.

29:01.862 --> 29:03.381
They terrified him, and
they found nothing.

29:03.501 --> 29:05.221
It was nothing.

29:06.501 --> 29:08.181
Febrile seizures recur.

29:08.301 --> 29:09.141
The paediatrician

29:09.261 --> 29:10.141
warned us about it.

29:10.261 --> 29:12.341
What if this is different?

29:12.501 --> 29:14.341
If he is not better
in 20 minutes,

29:14.461 --> 29:15.861
we'll take him in.

29:19.621 --> 29:21.461
She's in V-tach again.

29:21.581 --> 29:22.901
We got a pulse?

29:24.301 --> 29:26.181
Thready femoral.

29:26.301 --> 29:28.181
OK, Morris.

29:28.301 --> 29:29.741
Lead the way.

29:29.901 --> 29:31.421
All right, let's move her
to a trauma room.

29:31.581 --> 29:33.021
Prep for
peritoneal lavage,

29:33.181 --> 29:34.221
ten more litres
of warm saline,

29:34.341 --> 29:35.621
and grab a Thora-seal.

29:35.621 --> 29:37.181
Wait, you're leaving?

29:37.341 --> 29:38.461
Get it started.

29:38.581 --> 29:39.861
I'll be in soon.

29:42.381 --> 29:45.501
It was probably
diverticulosis.

29:45.701 --> 29:47.421
So, she blew an artery
in her colon wall

29:47.541 --> 29:48.341
and bled to death.

29:48.461 --> 29:49.301
It wasn't foreseeable.

29:49.461 --> 29:51.021
She had none of
the predictors.

29:51.141 --> 29:52.701
Like bloody stool?

29:52.861 --> 29:55.141
Yeah, that
would be one.

29:55.141 --> 29:57.501
She had it.

29:57.621 --> 29:58.861
Uh, it's not here.

29:58.981 --> 29:59.821
You never said.

29:59.901 --> 30:01.021
She had it.

30:01.181 --> 30:02.901
Did you do a
rectal exam?

30:03.061 --> 30:05.381
Check for
occult blood?

30:05.381 --> 30:06.581
Did you ask her

30:06.741 --> 30:08.941
about any specific
signs of GI bleeding?

30:09.101 --> 30:10.621
She, uh, she said
something about the food

30:10.741 --> 30:12.301
making her stool red.

30:12.301 --> 30:14.261
Why didn't you bring this up
at rounds?

30:14.421 --> 30:16.101
Cos she had
so many complaints.

30:16.261 --> 30:18.821
Her headache could have
been a brain bleed,

30:18.981 --> 30:20.861
her backache
a ruptured triple-A.

30:20.941 --> 30:22.061
It's your job to decide

30:22.221 --> 30:24.061
what needs to be considered
and when to speak up.

30:24.181 --> 30:25.181
If you're submissive

30:25.341 --> 30:26.861
at all when someone's
life on the line,

30:26.861 --> 30:27.901
you're not ready for this.

30:28.061 --> 30:31.061
I tried to speak up,
and nobody listened!

30:32.661 --> 30:34.261
Let's discuss this later.

30:44.340 --> 30:47.100
There's no way to be ready
for something like this,

30:47.260 --> 30:50.140
but in the end,
it will make you better.

30:50.300 --> 30:51.980
You can't be
a great doctor

30:52.140 --> 30:54.700
until you've killed
a patient.

30:54.860 --> 30:56.620
Yeah, I've heard
that before.

30:56.780 --> 30:59.220
I think it's called
a rationalisation.

31:20.820 --> 31:21.980
How you feeling?

31:21.980 --> 31:24.140
Hey, little man,
you had us scared.

31:24.300 --> 31:27.860
Can't have our number one wide
out on the injured reserve list.

31:27.860 --> 31:30.220
Here, have some water.

It's gonna
save Max's life,

put him on a path
of getting healthy,

31:53.380 --> 31:54.460
getting medical coverage.

31:54.620 --> 31:56.260
Well, if you can convince
Neuro to readmit him.

31:56.460 --> 31:57.620
I can, with your help.
Dr Gates...

31:57.780 --> 31:59.420
Come on, indulge that
inner softy one more time.

31:59.580 --> 32:00.780
All right, this

32:00.940 --> 32:02.220
Can I hug you?
I want to hug you.

32:02.380 --> 32:03.620
You try that, and
you'll be the one

32:03.820 --> 32:06.500
with a traumatic
injury.
You're the best.

32:06.500 --> 32:08.220

Hey, Suri,
what happened to my patient?

32:11.420 --> 32:13.179
I just got here -
that bed's been empty.

32:13.339 --> 32:14.099
Anybody see
him leave?

32:14.179 --> 32:15.059
Sorry, I don't know.

32:15.259 --> 32:16.659
Hey, Frank, I had
a guy in there

32:16.819 --> 32:18.099
from Radiology,
Max Gonzalez, a vet.

32:18.259 --> 32:20.019
He had a duffel bag with
him - you seen him?

32:20.179 --> 32:21.219
Yeah, that guy
was real jumpy.

32:21.379 --> 32:24.539
He went outside for a smoke
maybe 15 minutes ago.

32:33.299 --> 32:35.059
Max!

Max!

32:42.819 --> 32:43.819
Wait up.

32:47.419 --> 32:48.819
What happened?

32:48.979 --> 32:50.619
Went into v-fib,
didn't respond to the shock.

32:50.739 --> 32:52.539
She's still too cold.

32:52.699 --> 32:54.419
All right, this is why
I wanted to transfer.

32:54.579 --> 32:55.739
This is what I
was worried about.

32:55.939 --> 32:57.899
Think she'd be better off
coding in a rig right now?

32:58.019 --> 32:59.099
Please, I stayed calm.

32:59.219 --> 33:00.299
I did what you said.

33:00.419 --> 33:03.219
Please help her.

33:04.579 --> 33:06.259
BANFIELD:
'Please.'

33:06.259 --> 33:07.179
You don't need
to do that.

33:07.339 --> 33:09.179
Yeah, I don't want him
to pull the IV out.

33:09.339 --> 33:10.699
I'll hold his
hand instead.

I'm gonna open up
your daughter's chest

Why don't we do
a head CT first?

35:30.177 --> 35:31.537
We only have one scanner

35:56.937 --> 35:58.097
My son has a history
of febrile seizures.

OK, a seizure can't
account for that.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.617
She should be warm enough now
to respond to the shock.

36:21.737 --> 36:23.577
Clear!

36:24.777 --> 36:28.137
(GROANS)
I don't understand this.

36:28.257 --> 36:29.457
Autoscope.

36:29.577 --> 36:30.577
Mr Herrero,

36:30.737 --> 36:32.457
did you see her hit
anything on the way down?

36:32.537 --> 36:33.417
Se golpio la cabeza?

36:33.537 --> 36:36.177
No. No creo.

36:36.297 --> 36:37.817
On some rocks? Anything?

36:37.977 --> 36:40.977
Estaba muy agitada,
asi que la lleve a pasear.

36:41.137 --> 36:42.937
She was really cranky,
so he took her out.

36:43.057 --> 36:45.097
Es mi culpa?

36:45.217 --> 36:46.377
Hice algo mal?

36:46.537 --> 36:48.817
He's asking if
it's his fault.

36:48.977 --> 36:50.657
If he did
something wrong.

36:50.857 --> 36:51.697
GREENE:
'Cat scans show signs'

36:51.817 --> 36:52.937
of hypoattenuation

36:52.937 --> 36:55.097
in the distribution
of the MCA.

36:55.097 --> 36:57.136
I'm not a doctor.
Can you explain that?

36:57.296 --> 36:58.776
Your son had a stroke.
What?!

36:58.976 --> 37:00.576
How...w-w-why
would he have that?

37:00.776 --> 37:01.976
I can't explain
that yet.

37:02.136 --> 37:04.176
HALEH:
He's Bradying down.

37:04.376 --> 37:06.936
You need to give thrombolytics.
Not without a CBC.

37:07.096 --> 37:08.976
All right, 0.2 of epi
and prep some atropine.

37:09.136 --> 37:10.336
Let's keep neurosurge
in the loop.

37:10.496 --> 37:11.896
You said he...
you said this was a fever.

37:12.096 --> 37:13.856
You said he didn't
need anything.
99 out of 100 times...

37:14.016 --> 37:15.616
Stop talking like a doctor.
That's our son, damn it!

37:15.776 --> 37:17.256
HALEH:
Heart rate's down to 40.

37:17.376 --> 37:18.896
No pulse.

37:19.056 --> 37:20.536
Starting compressions.

37:22.176 --> 37:24.336
Is there any sickle cell
in your family?

37:24.656 --> 37:26.976
Thalassemia?
No!

37:26.976 --> 37:29.536
Can you think of any reason
why your son had a stroke?

37:29.656 --> 37:30.496
No.

37:30.616 --> 37:32.896
Start atropine.

37:32.896 --> 37:34.496
Mark.

37:34.656 --> 37:36.176
They're waiting
for you upstairs.

37:36.176 --> 37:37.536
I'm a little busy here.

37:37.536 --> 37:39.496
Yeah, I can take over.
It looks like you need a break.

37:39.616 --> 37:40.776
Any meds?

37:40.936 --> 37:42.696
No, he's healthy.
He doesn't take anything.

37:42.896 --> 37:44.736
(SOTTO VOCE):
I'll see if they can
hold your chemo.

37:47.136 --> 37:49.536
Is it possible that
he ingested something?

37:49.696 --> 37:51.416
Something from your
medicine cabinet?

37:54.136 --> 37:55.256
Maybe it's an ingestion.

37:55.376 --> 37:56.656
She's up to 94 now.

37:56.856 --> 37:59.496
What medicines are in the house?
MORRIS:
Clear!

37:59.696 --> 38:02.056
SANDRA:
Nothing, just aspirin.
Anything else?

38:02.056 --> 38:02.936
Prescription meds,
over-the-counter?

38:03.056 --> 38:04.176
Still V-fib.

38:04.336 --> 38:05.936
Sandra, mi medicina.
What? What does he take?

38:06.096 --> 38:08.216
Pills for blood pressure,
carda-something.

38:08.416 --> 38:10.376
Is there any way Valecia
could've gotten into them?
No.

38:10.536 --> 38:12.296
It has a child-proof cap...
Esta abierta.

38:12.456 --> 38:14.296
Diltiazem.
Diltiazem!

38:14.416 --> 38:15.616
Very toxic in kids.

38:15.776 --> 38:18.536
Blanca, half a gram
of calcium. IV push.

38:18.656 --> 38:20.496
I'll check trauma one.

38:23.016 --> 38:25.256
Lab says that
specimen's hemolyzed.
It's probably because

38:25.496 --> 38:27.016
they just let it sit
around for an hour.

38:27.176 --> 38:28.856
Not the first time.
It's all right.

38:29.016 --> 38:30.616
I always draw
an extra red top.

38:30.616 --> 38:31.656
Whoa, let me look at that.

38:31.816 --> 38:33.895
What? What is it?
The buffy coat.

38:34.055 --> 38:35.535
You can't diagnose
anything from...

38:35.695 --> 38:37.535
Look at the ratio
of whites to reds.

38:37.535 --> 38:39.775
Haleh, call oncology.

38:39.975 --> 38:42.015
Have them get that
leukapheresis machine
down here now.

38:42.175 --> 38:43.255
Oncology?

38:43.415 --> 38:45.815
You're going to do that
without a confirmed diagnosis?

38:45.815 --> 38:48.975
The seizure, the stroke,
it's sludging.

38:48.975 --> 38:51.175
It all fits.
Oh, God.

38:51.175 --> 38:53.135
Jerry, I want you to drag

38:53.295 --> 38:55.055
a hematologist
to a microscope

38:55.255 --> 38:56.495
and make him look
at this boy's smear.

38:56.655 --> 38:57.735
JERRY:
Right away, Dr Greene.

38:57.935 --> 38:59.855
Is someone going to tell me
what is happening here?

38:59.855 --> 39:01.815
Leukemia.

39:05.655 --> 39:08.215
Daryl's got leukemia.

39:08.215 --> 39:11.215
LUIS:
Sana, sana colita de rana...

39:11.335 --> 39:12.615
What's he doing?

39:12.775 --> 39:14.375
"Little frog tail,"
it's a nursery rhyme.

39:14.455 --> 39:15.935
Si no sanas ahora...

39:16.055 --> 39:16.975
"If you don't heal today..."

39:17.095 --> 39:18.775
..sanaras manana.

39:18.935 --> 39:21.495
"You'll heal tomorrow."
Sana, sana colita...

39:21.655 --> 39:24.455
Another round of epi.
Toxicology's on their way.

39:24.455 --> 39:26.215
All right, Dr Martin,
make those compressions count.

39:26.415 --> 39:30.735
ALVARADO:
Calcium's on board.
Sana, sana colita de rana...

39:30.855 --> 39:32.335
Pushing epi.

39:32.335 --> 39:35.015
Epi's in.
Infusion's on the way.

39:35.135 --> 39:36.295
Is this the leukapheresis case?

39:36.415 --> 39:37.535
We almost have access.

39:37.695 --> 39:39.335
Switch with me.
Platelets are up.

39:39.335 --> 39:40.495
BANFIELD:
Platelets?

39:40.655 --> 39:42.255
We don't even know
if he's thrombocytopenic.

39:42.415 --> 39:44.975
He's oozing around his IVs,
there's no way he's not.

39:44.975 --> 39:46.255
Platelets could
worsen the viscosity.

39:46.255 --> 39:47.255
He needs a femoral line.

39:47.415 --> 39:48.655
I can't place it
if he can't clot.

39:48.815 --> 39:50.255
We have no choice.
He could stroke out!

39:50.415 --> 39:51.815
Listen to me -
we have no choice.

39:51.815 --> 39:54.335
Calcium's back, 4.2.

39:54.495 --> 39:55.575
Going in the right direction.

39:55.735 --> 39:57.375
Not fast enough.
Push another half gram.

39:57.375 --> 39:58.215
Got it.

39:58.375 --> 40:02.015
Repeat the level
with calce, phos, sodium.

40:02.135 --> 40:04.535
Potassium, BUN, creatinine, LDH.

40:04.695 --> 40:05.655
It's been over
ten minutes.

40:05.775 --> 40:07.615
Is-is this going to help?

40:07.775 --> 40:10.134
This machine
improves blood flow.

40:10.134 --> 40:11.934
It'll give his heart
a chance to rebound.

40:11.934 --> 40:14.294
When will we know
it's working?

40:14.294 --> 40:16.454
It takes a little time.

40:16.614 --> 40:17.814
MORRIS:
It's been 30 minutes.

40:21.894 --> 40:23.614

40:26.694 --> 40:27.734
No change.

Five of insulin

40:38.174 --> 40:40.014

40:40.134 --> 40:41.174
Still V-tach.

40:41.174 --> 40:43.734
Going again. Clear!

40:44.694 --> 40:46.174
Dr Greene.

40:46.294 --> 40:47.654
Mix 20 of kayexalate.

Oh, my God.

41:09.574 --> 41:11.134

Is she back?

41:15.614 --> 41:16.574
You got her back?

His brain's been deprived
of oxygen.

41:21.774 --> 41:23.694
Call surgery.

41:23.694 --> 41:26.494
We need to get her upstairs
so they can close the chest.

..and, uh...

49:31.569 --> 49:35.929
how hard it can be
to find the resilience.

49:40.968 --> 49:43.288
I just hope

49:43.408 --> 49:46.088
you and your husband find...

49:46.088 --> 49:47.168
DOOR OPENS

49:47.328 --> 49:48.168
ROMANO:
Greene?

49:48.328 --> 49:50.648
A minute in the hall?

49:50.768 --> 49:52.728
Excuse me.

49:55.648 --> 49:57.288
So, Oncology is mad at me.

49:57.408 --> 49:58.328
Why do you suppose that is?

49:58.448 --> 50:00.648
I've had my hands full, Robert.

50:00.648 --> 50:02.208
Yeah, well, I just
used all my pull

50:02.368 --> 50:03.768
and influence
to persuade them

50:03.928 --> 50:05.688
to keep the chemo suite open
for one more hour.

50:05.688 --> 50:07.568
So get your ass up there
or I'm going to sell

50:07.568 --> 50:09.608
your Vincristine on the black
market for its street value.

50:09.728 --> 50:10.768
I'm still...

50:10.768 --> 50:11.808
Stop complaining!

50:11.968 --> 50:13.328
Nobody told you
to go and get cancer.

50:26.608 --> 50:29.208
I have to go.

50:29.408 --> 50:31.368
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

50:31.488 --> 50:33.608
You never answered my question.

50:36.288 --> 50:38.008
I can't let you extubate him.

50:38.128 --> 50:39.608
You know that.

50:58.528 --> 51:01.488
You're free to cut the tube.

51:29.527 --> 51:31.487
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

51:42.007 --> 51:43.727
(SIGHS)

52:14.967 --> 52:19.207
Those are the ones
you never forget.

52:19.367 --> 52:21.567
You shouldn't
be doing that.

52:21.727 --> 52:24.807
I keep a secret stash
in the back of the fridge.

52:24.967 --> 52:27.887
Crack one open when something
really amazing happens.

52:29.767 --> 52:31.647
In five years here,
this is like...

52:31.767 --> 52:33.767
the third one I've drunk.

52:35.807 --> 52:38.287
One beer every 20 months,
I can overlook.

52:38.407 --> 52:40.927
So...

52:41.047 --> 52:43.367
forgive me for noticing,

52:43.527 --> 52:45.367
but what happened
in there?

52:45.487 --> 52:47.287
Something changed.

52:49.486 --> 52:51.446
The situation evolved.

52:54.046 --> 52:56.646
It was a kid, right?

52:56.766 --> 53:02.006
We all have one.

53:02.006 --> 53:05.926
Some case you blew or...
patient you should've saved.

53:06.046 --> 53:08.646
Yours was a kid?

53:08.806 --> 53:11.286
(SIGHS)
Yeah.

53:11.286 --> 53:13.686
How old?

53:16.886 --> 53:19.366
He was five years old.

53:19.486 --> 53:22.006
Those are the worst.

53:22.126 --> 53:24.526
He was my son.

53:24.526 --> 53:26.926
He died here.

53:28.966 --> 53:31.526
In trauma one.

53:33.366 --> 53:36.326
Your son...died in this ER?

53:38.206 --> 53:40.406
And you're working here?

53:44.566 --> 53:45.966
I'm not sure why I've done

53:46.126 --> 53:48.006
anything I've done
since that day.

53:48.166 --> 53:52.086
Why did I not leave
my apartment

53:52.206 --> 53:53.846
for almost two years?

53:54.006 --> 53:57.966
Then I see the news
about the tsunami...

53:58.126 --> 54:02.606
and I fly to a place
10,000 miles away.

54:05.046 --> 54:07.366
Why'd I do that?

54:07.486 --> 54:09.446
Why'd I come back?

54:12.446 --> 54:16.286
Why did my son have leukemia?

54:18.566 --> 54:21.526
I never understood
any of it.

54:26.645 --> 54:29.405
I'm-I'm sorry for your,
for your loss.

54:34.005 --> 54:37.325
I...I don't really
know what to say.

54:38.885 --> 54:41.005
When your parents are gone,
you're an orphan.

54:41.005 --> 54:45.485
A spouse dies, you're
a widow or widower.

54:45.605 --> 54:50.205
But when you lose your baby...

54:50.325 --> 54:52.765
there's no word for that.

55:03.805 --> 55:05.845
See to it she gets this
before you go.

55:30.125 --> 55:31.765
BOAT HORN

55:36.645 --> 55:40.805
Hey. Listen,
I would really like to see you.

55:40.925 --> 55:44.005
I-I miss you, Elizabeth.

55:44.125 --> 55:46.725
Please, please don't...

55:46.845 --> 55:48.645
don't...don't cry.

55:50.405 --> 55:51.725
Yeah...

55:51.845 --> 55:53.525
tonight.

55:53.685 --> 55:56.085
Yeah, yeah.
I'll-I'll come over.

55:56.205 --> 55:59.005
I'll see you then.

56:05.764 --> 56:07.564
I'm sorry
I wasn't there

56:07.724 --> 56:10.764
when they came
for Daryl.

56:10.884 --> 56:14.604
But I, uh, I had to be
somewhere, so, um...

56:17.044 --> 56:19.204
It was an atypical presentation.

56:19.324 --> 56:21.724
Nobody could've picked it up.

56:23.644 --> 56:25.924
If I had just brought him
in earlier...

56:25.924 --> 56:30.364
He had acute leukemia,
that's why he died.

56:30.364 --> 56:32.924
It might've given me
another day,

56:33.044 --> 56:35.444
a little more time.

56:41.364 --> 56:43.124
They said we can go now.

56:51.764 --> 56:56.644
I-I appreciate your effort,
Dr Greene.

56:56.764 --> 56:58.484
Take care.

56:58.604 --> 57:00.244
Both of you.

57:00.364 --> 57:02.684
Good luck.

57:22.644 --> 57:25.164
BANFIELD:
Baby?

57:25.284 --> 57:28.204
Where are you?

57:45.523 --> 57:48.203
(SIGHS)

57:48.203 --> 57:51.003
You never cried...

57:51.163 --> 57:56.003
at the hospital,
at the funeral.

57:56.163 --> 57:58.523
I've been...

57:58.643 --> 58:02.323
I've been
really angry about that.

58:02.483 --> 58:06.283
You never cried
about anything since that day.

58:09.203 --> 58:10.843
Maybe we've been fooling
ourselves.

58:11.003 --> 58:14.443
Maybe we've been done
for a long time,

58:14.603 --> 58:18.283
but never
figured it out.

58:18.283 --> 58:20.603
I never blamed you.

58:20.723 --> 58:23.083
Never.

58:40.403 --> 58:43.643
I used to think
every day that...

58:43.803 --> 58:45.923
if God told me
I could die

58:45.923 --> 58:48.883
and go to Heaven and be
with Daryl, I would do it.

58:50.963 --> 58:55.203
I wondered if that made
me an awful person,

58:55.363 --> 58:57.563
that I'd give up
my life with you,

58:57.723 --> 59:02.203
give up everything we could
still have in the future.

59:14.682 --> 59:19.602
I never...really
got away from the feeling

59:19.722 --> 59:22.642
like I need to be with him.

59:22.762 --> 59:24.682
Dreaming of him.

59:27.962 --> 59:33.042
I never got away
from the idea that...

59:33.202 --> 59:38.322
somehow I'd be able
to hold him again.

59:38.322 --> 59:40.362
(DARYL AND BANFIELD LAUGHING)

59:53.762 --> 59:57.922
I've been afraid for so long.

59:58.082 --> 01:00:03.802
I don't want to be...
afraid...any more.

01:00:03.922 --> 01:00:06.802
