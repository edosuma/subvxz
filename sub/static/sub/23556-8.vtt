00:04.538 --> 00:07.473
William Rybosh was super rich,
Evie's biological father,

00:07.541 --> 00:09.975
and one of the relatives.

00:10.044 --> 00:12.011
You started!

00:12.079 --> 00:13.412
I asked you to wait.

00:13.481 --> 00:14.947
Yeah, but I can grow a mustache

00:15.016 --> 00:16.015
in the time it takes you to shower.

00:16.082 --> 00:17.983
You wish.

00:18.052 --> 00:20.185
So William was married to Lucia

00:20.254 --> 00:21.787
and then they separated.

00:21.856 --> 00:24.590
Lucia came here and tried to get Evie.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.058
That was so weird, right?

00:26.127 --> 00:27.860
Why?

00:27.928 --> 00:31.230
Well, um, William
was a millionaire, so...

00:31.298 --> 00:32.731
If she's no longer his wife...

00:32.800 --> 00:34.800
Who's going to inherit all his money?

00:36.303 --> 00:37.369
Evie.

00:39.273 --> 00:42.007
And if Lucia gets custody of Evie,

00:42.076 --> 00:43.776
she can get her hands on the fortune.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.644
And what's the easiest way
to get Evie back?

00:45.713 --> 00:48.414
Prove that Erik and Kate
aren't good parents.

00:48.482 --> 00:51.884
- So Lucia's the one who framed Erik for art theft.
- Yeah.

00:51.952 --> 00:53.185
Whoa.

00:53.254 --> 00:56.221
- That's some next-level evil.
- Yeah.

00:58.092 --> 00:59.792
I love your granola, Erik.

00:59.860 --> 01:02.294
- It's so yummy.
- It's special.

01:02.363 --> 01:05.898
I just thought we could
all use something special.

01:05.966 --> 01:08.367
What we guys need is a day of fun.

01:08.436 --> 01:09.468
What do you kids say?

01:09.537 --> 01:10.536
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

01:10.604 --> 01:11.670
Can I have new shoes?

01:13.207 --> 01:17.743
We could reopen, mm-hmm,
the Hunter Theatre.

01:17.812 --> 01:19.211
Yes, the Hunter Theatre!

01:19.280 --> 01:20.512
- Yes, please!
- Yes!

01:20.581 --> 01:24.049
All right, guys,
curtain's up at 5:00 sharp.

01:24.118 --> 01:26.151
This is gonna be so much fun.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.786
Last time, Kate wrote
a song about us.

01:27.855 --> 01:29.288
It was super funny!

01:29.356 --> 01:31.156
Maybe this time we should write
a song about her.

01:31.225 --> 01:32.558
Ooh, or I could do a dance.

01:32.626 --> 01:35.327
I mean, Daniel did teach me
some smooth moves.

01:35.396 --> 01:37.529
Anika, business first,
party later, okay?

01:37.598 --> 01:39.965
We need to figure out
this Lucia problem.

01:40.034 --> 01:41.900
They way I see it, the best way

01:41.969 --> 01:43.802
to stop Lucia
from getting custody of Evie

01:43.871 --> 01:46.505
is to prove that she can't be
a reliable parent.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.540
That she can't be trusted with Evie.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.577
Yeah, that's what she tried
to do to Erik

01:51.645 --> 01:53.345
when she framed him for stealing art.

01:53.414 --> 01:55.447
Exactly, and I say we return the favor.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.149
How?

01:57.218 --> 01:59.852
Well, we take a statue from the museum

01:59.920 --> 02:02.020
and plant it in her house.

02:02.089 --> 02:04.189
Then we'll tell Daniel
and he can arrest her.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.592
And everyone will know
that Lucia's the real crook.

02:06.660 --> 02:07.993
Great idea.

02:08.062 --> 02:10.294
I'm not sure about this.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.931
We can't afford to make any mistakes.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.967
I mean, what if something
happens to the statue?

02:15.035 --> 02:16.635
Good thinking.

02:18.205 --> 02:19.771
Oh, we can ask Magpie to make a copy.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.306
Ah, yes...

02:21.375 --> 02:23.442
I still don't think this is a good idea.

02:23.511 --> 02:25.944
Uh, guys? Guys?

02:28.249 --> 02:30.549
So what did you do for the last
Hunter Theatre show?

02:30.618 --> 02:32.217
I host today's science game show.

02:32.286 --> 02:34.319
It wasn't a game show, it was a quiz,

02:34.388 --> 02:36.488
and a very hard one.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.023
Think I'm gonna do
some magic this time.

02:38.092 --> 02:40.192
You should do one
of those card tricks...

02:40.261 --> 02:42.294
Guys!

02:42.363 --> 02:44.997
Look at these dresses,
they're so pretty.

02:45.065 --> 02:47.599
- Anika!
- Business first!

02:47.668 --> 02:49.134
We have to get to Magpie's.

02:49.203 --> 02:50.936
Plus, we need to get back
before Erik and Kate

02:51.005 --> 02:52.504
are done shopping with Evie.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.039
Yeah, but one of these dresses
would be perfect

02:54.108 --> 02:56.041
for my performance. I need one.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.244
This is the one.

02:59.313 --> 03:00.812
Oh, it would look great on you, but...

03:00.881 --> 03:02.314
do you have enough to pay for it?

03:05.252 --> 03:06.685
Cool.

03:07.922 --> 03:10.122
Miss, is this enough for the dress?

03:10.191 --> 03:11.456
No, I'm sorry.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.027
Can't she do something
to make up the difference?

03:15.095 --> 03:16.728
Like what?

03:16.797 --> 03:19.431
I'll be your salesperson.
I'm great at selling stuff.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.233
Yeah, we can help.

03:21.302 --> 03:23.502
Okay, I've been dying
for a coffee break.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.070
Why don't you guys watch the store?

03:25.139 --> 03:27.272
And if you sell two dresses
by the time I get back,

03:27.341 --> 03:28.774
the dress is yours.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.375
- How does that sound?
- Great.

03:30.444 --> 03:31.777
Look at this beautiful dress.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.545
It's perfect for any occasion.

03:33.614 --> 03:36.081
It's only ten euros. Only ten euros!

03:36.150 --> 03:37.616
Best deal in town!

03:37.685 --> 03:40.385
Flowers, I mean, they're so overrated.

03:40.454 --> 03:41.620
If you want to impress your wife,

03:41.689 --> 03:44.089
get her a gorgeous dress, I know.

03:44.158 --> 03:45.424
- Maybe you're right.
- Yeah.

03:45.492 --> 03:46.658
What about this one?

03:46.727 --> 03:49.261
Oh, it's available
for the low, low, low price

03:49.330 --> 03:51.063
of only ten euros.

03:51.131 --> 03:53.632
- That's a pretty good deal.
- I'll take it.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.735
Pleasure doing business with you, yeah.

03:57.905 --> 03:58.971
Your dress.

03:59.039 --> 04:00.038
Thank you.

04:00.107 --> 04:01.139
Have a good day.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.207
- Yeah, see ya, man.
- Have a great day!

04:02.276 --> 04:03.242
Have a nice day.

04:03.310 --> 04:05.544
- Wow.
- One down, one more to go.

04:06.647 --> 04:07.980
It's Lucia.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.014
- Guys, we have to hide.
- Hide!

04:11.252 --> 04:12.951
Wait, I-I-I'll...

04:14.822 --> 04:16.654
- Oh!
- Okay, I...

04:22.730 --> 04:24.529
Excuse me, how much is this dress?

04:24.598 --> 04:27.899
Only 20 euros, darling.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.769
Oh, do you have anything cheaper?

04:30.838 --> 04:32.671
Even cheaper than this?

04:34.441 --> 04:36.608
I mean, of course, darling.

04:36.677 --> 04:37.943
We have something cheaper.

04:39.179 --> 04:40.479
Do I know you from somewhere?

04:42.650 --> 04:45.117
Do you shop here often, darling?

04:45.185 --> 04:47.019
Yes, I do. It's my favorite outlet.

04:47.087 --> 04:50.122
Then you've probably
seen me here before, darling.

04:50.190 --> 04:52.324
- Maybe.
- Uh, this one's a nice one.

04:52.393 --> 04:54.092
It's only five euros.

04:54.161 --> 04:56.094
- Okay, I'll take it.
- Oh.

05:02.069 --> 05:04.002
Thank you, darling.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.571
- Bye.
- Bye, ta-ta.

05:10.511 --> 05:13.412
Ah, well done, darling.

05:14.882 --> 05:16.715
I'm gonna follow her home,
see what she's up to.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.717
I'll meet you guys back at my place.

05:18.786 --> 05:19.885
Wait!

05:21.355 --> 05:22.954
Use these as camouflage.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.791
Uh, uh, sweet. I'll pay for them.

05:25.859 --> 05:26.992
Okay, thanks.

05:28.529 --> 05:29.728
We did it! We sold two dresses!

05:29.797 --> 05:31.630
Seriously?

05:31.699 --> 05:33.265
How great. Well, in that case,

05:33.334 --> 05:34.566
you deserve this.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.502
Have fun with it.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.071
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.673
We need to move forward quicker.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.375
No, I can't live like this.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.611
I really need the money.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.115
Yes.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.585
I'll speak to you later.

05:55.000 --> 06:01.074

"Julius De Waard, Lawyer."

06:09.603 --> 06:11.837
Like I said, I'm not gonna
wait any longer.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.338
I need the money!

06:14.708 --> 06:17.209
Ah, where did you guys get this?

06:17.277 --> 06:19.244
In a museum, actually.

06:19.313 --> 06:20.645
It's pretty detailed, right?

06:22.716 --> 06:25.984
"If one wants to win,
one can't be afraid to begin."

06:27.855 --> 06:32.124
Ah, "The Book of Rhymes
for All Occasions."

06:32.192 --> 06:36.194
It's a fun book, and it actually
has some good lines.

06:36.263 --> 06:37.295
Keep it.

06:37.364 --> 06:40.098
Oh, no, I couldn't. I-I shouldn't.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.167
I'd be sad if you wouldn't.

06:43.504 --> 06:44.503
Well, thanks.

06:46.340 --> 06:48.206
So, can you really copy anything?

06:48.275 --> 06:51.243
Yes. Some things take a long time,

06:51.311 --> 06:53.145
like this vase.

06:53.213 --> 06:55.180
When do you need it?

06:55.249 --> 06:56.314
In an hour?

06:56.383 --> 06:58.617
That's not possible.

06:58.685 --> 07:01.987
But I've got something else
that might do.

07:02.055 --> 07:05.824
This was my first test.

07:05.893 --> 07:08.860
I still remember Erik's face
when he saw it.

07:08.929 --> 07:12.063
Ha-ha-ha, he couldn't believe his eyes.

07:13.434 --> 07:16.268
- Can we borrow it?
- No.

07:16.336 --> 07:17.803
You can have it.

07:19.306 --> 07:20.505
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

07:20.574 --> 07:21.673
You're welcome.

07:55.576 --> 07:57.309
Think I just lost her.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.312
And I'm wet.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.748
There he is! Sal!

08:03.817 --> 08:05.951
What happened to you?

08:07.955 --> 08:08.987
A long story.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.889
Well, did you follow Lucia?

08:10.958 --> 08:12.390
I lost her.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.759
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.095
"If you took every chance
you could possibly take,

08:17.164 --> 08:19.598
the occasional failure
would not be a mistake."

08:21.635 --> 08:23.502
What? This book has a rhyme
for everything.

08:23.570 --> 08:27.305
Wait, I did hear something
before she got away.

08:27.374 --> 08:29.007
She was talking on the phone

08:29.076 --> 08:30.642
and said she really needed money.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.943
Of course she does. Nice work, Sal.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.813
Oh, our theory's really checking out.

08:34.881 --> 08:36.147
And we still know where Lucia lives.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.683
So let's set this plan into action.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.320
This must be it.

08:42.389 --> 08:44.456
It's the house from Jenny's footage.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.958
Looks like nobody's home.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.226
How do we know for sure?

08:56.837 --> 08:58.270
Here we go. Come on!

09:12.252 --> 09:13.818
Are we really gonna break in?

09:13.887 --> 09:15.820
It's a risk we gotta be taking.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.390
That one was by Jake.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.992
- Take that.
- Wow, you should write the sequel.

09:28.602 --> 09:29.801
We have to find a way in.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.202
I'll check around the corner.

09:31.271 --> 09:32.270
Okay, be careful.

09:42.649 --> 09:44.516
What is taking her so long?

09:44.585 --> 09:46.685
I cannot stand waiting.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.620
Yes, it might be frustrating.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.522
But there's no point in debating.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.857
Anika truly loves roller-skating.

09:54.494 --> 09:56.127
Huh?

09:56.196 --> 09:57.662
Maybe it could use some work.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.064
Guys!

10:02.169 --> 10:03.868
Somebody needs to be the lookout.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.370
- Works for me.
- Yeah.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.275
All right, good luck, guys. Be careful.

10:13.614 --> 10:16.047
You see all these paintings?

10:16.116 --> 10:18.083
That must be like
the entire Rybosh family.

10:18.151 --> 10:21.186
Yeah, but why are some of them missing?

10:22.422 --> 10:24.956
- Maybe she sold them.
- Guys!

10:25.025 --> 10:27.659
Let's place the vase
and get out of here.

10:27.728 --> 10:28.893
Lucia might come back.

10:35.902 --> 10:37.669
Maybe here?

10:37.738 --> 10:39.270
Nah, way too obvious.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.272
Lucia would notice it
and wonder how it got there.

10:50.484 --> 10:51.583
Oh!

10:57.624 --> 10:58.690
Perfect!

11:00.127 --> 11:01.226
Vase?

11:02.362 --> 11:03.428
Oh.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.097
Come on.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.569
Right, thank you.

11:14.508 --> 11:17.042
Ah, this is good, this is so good.

11:17.110 --> 11:20.879
"Giving in to distraction
prevents taking action."

11:20.947 --> 11:22.380
Exactly.

11:31.658 --> 11:33.258
"Nothing can take you by surprise

11:33.326 --> 11:35.860
if you learn to see
what's in front of your eyes."

11:35.929 --> 11:37.362
That is so true.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.602
Can we go now?

11:54.881 --> 11:55.980
Hide.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.163
Somebody here?

12:47.567 --> 12:49.100
Yes, hello?

12:49.169 --> 12:50.668
Ah, yes.

12:50.737 --> 12:54.506
I'm very glad that we agreed
to take this to the next phase.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.875
Yes, I'm gonna need those funds ASAP.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.143
I'm on my way.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.018
You know, I wish I had known
this a little bit earlier.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.720
I just got home.

13:12.058 --> 13:13.091
Let's go.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.732
- Hurry, come on!
- Oh, my dress.

13:20.801 --> 13:21.833
Go! Go!

13:23.236 --> 13:24.836
I am so sorry.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.104
I was reading and everything...

13:28.308 --> 13:30.108
It doesn't matter! Everything's okay.

13:30.177 --> 13:32.243
I think it's time we get out of here!

13:32.312 --> 13:33.478
Ahh!

13:42.556 --> 13:46.057
These are the best shoes ever!

13:46.126 --> 13:48.426
She must've tried on
a hundred pairs of shoes,

13:48.495 --> 13:50.595
but these are definitely the winner.

13:52.666 --> 13:55.500
So did you guys put up Hunter Theatre?

13:57.070 --> 13:59.137
We forgot to set up the theater.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.105
Oh, you're in luck. You still got time.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.308
Yeah, we lost track of time...

14:03.376 --> 14:04.709
reading rhyme after rhyme.

14:04.778 --> 14:06.678
You're becoming a true poet, Tess.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.615
Oh, we're out of tea.

14:10.684 --> 14:13.251
Honey, would you be so kind
to go buy me some?

14:13.320 --> 14:14.752
Yeah, no problem. Be back soon.

14:16.122 --> 14:18.756
Uh, we have to go set up the theater.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.698
So we have to build the stage,
hang up the curtains,

14:26.766 --> 14:28.733
- and set up the li...
- Oh, no!

14:28.802 --> 14:30.501
What's wrong?

14:30.570 --> 14:31.669
This is not my dress.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.004
Which means I took the wrong bag,

14:33.073 --> 14:34.239
which means my dress is still at...

14:34.307 --> 14:35.406
- Lucia's!
- Oh!

14:35.475 --> 14:37.041
If Lucia finds out, we...

14:37.110 --> 14:38.409
We have to switch the dresses.

14:38.478 --> 14:39.644
Yeah, this dress is hideous!

14:39.713 --> 14:41.346
Well, we can't leave now.
The show starts in an hour.

14:41.414 --> 14:42.614
And we don't have a theater!

14:42.682 --> 14:44.649
Divide and conquer, all right.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.050
Let's draw straws.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.086
Short straw loses, has to stay
here and set up, okay?

14:50.257 --> 14:52.457
- Oh.
- Sorry, Jake.

14:52.525 --> 14:53.992
Maybe Tess can help you
when she gets home.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.994
- Come on, we have to hurry.
- But...

14:57.530 --> 15:00.265
I was...

15:04.571 --> 15:05.737
How do we get in?

15:05.805 --> 15:06.905
Just follow me.

15:22.856 --> 15:24.756
- There it is.
- Nice.

15:24.824 --> 15:25.957
Now, how are we gonna get it?

15:28.461 --> 15:29.894
Now what?

15:36.603 --> 15:37.936
You're a genius.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.208
Hey, Jake, do you have any ideas

15:44.277 --> 15:45.410
for what I can do in the show?

15:45.478 --> 15:47.312
Uh, um...

15:47.380 --> 15:48.880
I'm a little busy.

15:48.949 --> 15:51.582
I'm sure you'll think of
something amazing, Evie.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.754
Maybe, maybe you could do
an act with your shoes.

15:56.823 --> 15:59.223
They'll look amazing up here
in the theater when it's dark.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.326
My dad would've loved these shoes.

16:01.394 --> 16:02.794
He always wore cool ones.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.595
I'm gonna go practice.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.547
Ah, this is terrible.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.515
I can explain!

16:24.584 --> 16:26.451
What is taking Sal and Anika so long?

16:26.519 --> 16:28.152
Oh, uh...

16:28.221 --> 16:30.788
Oh, I knew this was a bad idea.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.056
What if they get caught?

16:37.931 --> 16:38.997
- On the desk.
- Is that good?

16:39.065 --> 16:40.231
Yeah, yeah, drop.

16:41.368 --> 16:42.700
Now get your bag.

16:45.872 --> 16:46.938
Come on.

16:48.742 --> 16:49.807
Yes, you got it.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.444
Careful, careful, careful.

17:08.595 --> 17:10.328
Okay, come on.

17:10.396 --> 17:12.363
Almost, almost, a little bit further.

17:21.007 --> 17:22.507
- Did you do it?
- Are you okay?

17:22.575 --> 17:24.108
- Of course.
- Ta-da!

17:26.046 --> 17:27.512
Guys, I've been having second thoughts

17:27.579 --> 17:29.480
on the plan to frame Lucia.

17:29.549 --> 17:30.982
I don't think it's the best
way to keep Evie.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.116
Yeah, where is Evie?

17:32.185 --> 17:34.085
- Oh, Evie?
- Evie, where are you?

17:34.154 --> 17:35.286
Hi, guys.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.455
Oh, you look like you've been caught

17:37.524 --> 17:39.891
- with your hand in a cookie jar.
- What's up?

17:39.959 --> 17:41.993
Did you forget to set up
Hunter Theatre, hmm?

17:44.731 --> 17:45.830
Where's Evie?

17:50.470 --> 17:51.536
Wow!

18:05.351 --> 18:06.717
I did it!

18:08.154 --> 18:09.921
Wow, this kid is full of surprises.

18:09.989 --> 18:12.723
Okay, guys, let's get
ready for theater!

18:12.792 --> 18:13.891
- Yes!
- Yeah!

18:16.329 --> 18:18.362
This...

18:18.431 --> 18:20.231
You're the best!

18:20.300 --> 18:22.166
Thank you! Thank you!

18:24.104 --> 18:26.037
I have a present for you.

18:26.106 --> 18:27.205
Wait a minute.

18:32.779 --> 18:33.945
Daddy!

18:35.648 --> 18:37.448
Well, you know, I...

18:37.517 --> 18:38.516
Thank you!

18:38.585 --> 18:39.851
It's all right.

18:45.959 --> 18:49.093
Standing here, I see a family
that always protects

18:49.162 --> 18:50.962
and takes care of each other.

18:51.030 --> 18:55.266
But I also see a family
that knows how to have fun.

18:55.335 --> 18:58.803
So, welcome to Hunter Theatre!

19:00.673 --> 19:03.040
It's showtime!

19:11.784 --> 19:13.451
Whoo!

19:16.890 --> 19:18.322
- <i>Olé!
- Olé!</i>

19:18.391 --> 19:20.224
<i>Olé!</i>

19:36.676 --> 19:37.975
Aw!

19:38.044 --> 19:39.110
Whoo!

19:41.447 --> 19:42.914
Pick a card, any card.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.081
Okay.

19:46.019 --> 19:47.518
Is this your card?

19:50.190 --> 19:52.123
Was this your card?

19:54.027 --> 19:55.193
Well done.

19:58.731 --> 20:00.565
"The Hunter kids take the cake.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.500
"There's artsy-fartsy Jake.

20:02.569 --> 20:04.735
"And Sal who's always got a hunch.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.837
"What a weird, cool, awesome bunch.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.407
"There's Evie who really rocks.

20:09.475 --> 20:12.276
"And Anika, who's quite the chatterbox.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.145
"And Tess, she'll go down in history.

20:14.214 --> 20:16.614
Together, we can solve any mystery!"

20:18.017 --> 20:19.517
Whoo!

20:19.586 --> 20:20.885
That was good.

20:20.954 --> 20:22.520
First I didn't know what to do.

20:22.589 --> 20:25.423
But then Jake gave me a great idea.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.736
Go, Evie! Go, Evie!

20:46.679 --> 20:49.880
A true magician
never reveals his secrets.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.382
Oh, please!

20:51.451 --> 20:52.650
Did you put the card in your mouth?

20:52.719 --> 20:54.652
Guys, I think it's time to call Daniel.

20:54.721 --> 20:55.920
Oh, right, I almost forgot.

20:55.989 --> 20:57.021
The Lucia plan.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.122
I don't know about that.

20:58.191 --> 20:59.523
We almost got busted today.

21:00.627 --> 21:01.859
Tess is right.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.861
We don't want to make things
worse for Erik and Kate.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.264
So what do you suggest?

21:06.332 --> 21:08.633
Maybe we should go to the relatives.

21:08.701 --> 21:11.836
William Rybosh was
one of them after all.

21:11.904 --> 21:13.838
Okay, well, let's go.

21:13.906 --> 21:16.340
No, it's too late to go tonight.

21:16.409 --> 21:17.908
We'll call.

21:17.977 --> 21:19.410
And in the morning, we'll tell Daniel

21:19.479 --> 21:20.645
to go over and arrest her.

21:20.713 --> 21:23.514
<i>And you did all this yourselves?</i>

21:23.583 --> 21:24.815
Mm-hmm.

21:24.884 --> 21:26.651
<i>I am not amused.</i>

21:26.719 --> 21:29.520
<i>Not amused at all.</i>

21:29.589 --> 21:34.358
<i>Come here first thing tomorrow morning.</i>

21:34.427 --> 21:37.295
<i>You have no idea how much
danger you've put us in.</i>
