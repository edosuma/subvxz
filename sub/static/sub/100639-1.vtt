You probably run away
from shit like this, too.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.932
Well, running’s clearly
a foreign concept to you.

-Fuck you.
-No, fuck you.

I got a call from Ms. Chu.

-You didn't get in trouble again, did you?
-Nope, school was great.

29:15.754 --> 29:19.841
Not as great as the ride home.
Coffee took me on a routine traffic stop

There’s something we should talk about.

What happened?

29:32.520 --> 29:36.149

-[Vanessa] Okay, what part is the typo?

-Yeah, they can make mistakes.

Okay, no, you need to start talking
right the fuck now.

30:21.903 --> 30:24.781
All right, this all started when your son
tried to have me killed

30:24.864 --> 30:26.491
because he saw us having sex this morning.

30:26.574 --> 30:27.826
-What?
-And I'm pretty sure

30:27.909 --> 30:29.744

is going on, but I’m calling the police.

upside the head with it.

38:49.452 --> 38:53.414

or I’m gonna fuck you inside out!

38:54.707 --> 38:57.084
Okay, Jesus, calm down.

38:58.502 --> 38:59.337
I get it.

38:59.754 --> 39:03.674
I mean, look at Mike Tyson.
He’s the OG of the shit.

39:04.175 --> 39:07.261
I mean, sure he could fuck people up,
but when he starts talking about,

39:07.345 --> 39:10.139
“I’m gonna eat your asshole out alive!

39:10.222 --> 39:12.350
And I’m gonna fuck you until you love me!”

39:13.434 --> 39:15.686

Yes, I am. You are going to stay here.
I can handle this.

is my dick in your ass.

40:42.690 --> 40:45.401
No. You're going back to the car.
That is non-negotiable.

and then I was out, right?

48:36.413 --> 48:38.916
I wanted to build like a fly-ass studio.

48:38.999 --> 48:42.586
Maybe one side a studio,
the other side would be a strip club?

48:42.669 --> 48:45.672
[Orlando] It was gonna be dope!
Coffee, you gotta protect me, man.

48:46.173 --> 48:47.424
Like, you gotta protect me.

48:47.507 --> 48:49.635
I said I was going to protect you
and I will.

48:49.718 --> 48:51.511
-[Coffee] You have my word.
-Okay.

48:51.595 --> 48:53.597
Bad cop, gay cop, motherfucker.

48:55.557 --> 48:57.684
Wait, why can’t I just ride
in the back with y'all?

48:57.768 --> 48:59.728
Coffee, you said you’d protect me!

48:59.811 --> 49:02.564
Trust me, tonight,
this trunk is the safest place in Detroit.

49:02.648 --> 49:03.482
[Orlando] No, wait!

49:03.565 --> 49:05.317
This fucking trunk's
getting a lot of action.

49:05.400 --> 49:06.860
[Orlando] Where we going?

49:08.570 --> 49:10.572
[phone beeps]

49:10.656 --> 49:12.741
Hill, it's Coffee.

49:13.158 --> 49:16.328
Don't talk, just listen.
I have something I need to share with you,

49:16.411 --> 49:19.456
but I need to see you in person.
Meet me at Venus in 30 minutes.

49:19.539 --> 49:22.834
Yeah, the one with the good buffet.
And come alone, we can't trust anyone.

49:24.628 --> 49:26.546
[Kareem's voice] <i>"Dear Mom,</i>
<i>I want you to know</i>

49:26.630 --> 49:29.049
<i>that Coffee told me</i>
<i>to shoot you with the taser.</i>

49:29.132 --> 49:32.135
<i>I didn’t wanna do it,</i>
<i>but he said it was our only option!</i>

49:32.219 --> 49:35.722
<i>You have horrible taste in men</i>
<i>and he is no exception.</i>

49:35.806 --> 49:38.392
<i>I went with him to find the dirty cops</i>
<i>who are after us,</i>

49:38.475 --> 49:41.478
<i>because he is a </i>huge<i> pussy</i>

49:41.561 --> 49:43.063

49:43.146 --> 49:46.066
<i>Do not go to the police.</i>
<i>It’s for your own safety!</i>

49:46.149 --> 49:48.193
<i>I’ll be back later.</i>
<i>Love, Kareem.</i>

49:48.902 --> 49:51.446
<i>P.S. Sorry for the bad language."</i>

49:51.530 --> 49:53.740
[Rodney] Was it room three or room four?

49:53.824 --> 49:56.660
-[D] Look at the fucking key!
-[Rodney] Don't raise your voice at me.

49:56.743 --> 49:58.412
You have to understand
the chain of command.

49:58.495 --> 50:00.288
Now, when you shot that manager’s
knee-cap off,

50:00.372 --> 50:02.082
I felt like
that’s a passive aggressive move

50:02.165 --> 50:05.168
to really shoot me!
Sometimes, because we’re carrying guns,

50:05.252 --> 50:08.046
I feel like it makes us tempted
to use ‘em, and we don’t have to.

50:08.130 --> 50:11.425
We need to put these down
and pick these up. Our voices.

50:11.508 --> 50:12.384
Okay?

50:12.968 --> 50:14.761
Yo, where the fuck you going?
It’s right here.

50:14.845 --> 50:15.971
Give me the goddamn key.

50:16.054 --> 50:17.723
You better stop with all that
Dr. Phil shit.

50:17.806 --> 50:19.683
Putting your feelings
and all that TED Talk shit

50:19.766 --> 50:21.018
you got in your fucking head.

50:21.101 --> 50:22.936
You need to get in the goddamn game.

50:23.020 --> 50:25.063
You better keep up with my black ass.
Let’s go.

50:25.147 --> 50:28.608
[Rodney] Yo, we know you in here!
Don’t make this harder than it’s gotta be!

50:29.234 --> 50:31.445
[Coffee] What I tell you about the buffet,
not bad, right?

50:32.446 --> 50:34.948
[Kareem] Yeah, this is my scene,
right here.

50:35.032 --> 50:36.324
[hip hop bass line]

50:36.408 --> 50:38.744
Listen, the only reason we’re here
is because we made a deal

50:38.827 --> 50:40.203
and I’m a man of my word.

50:40.287 --> 50:43.790
But you have to give me your word
that you won’t tell your mom about this.

50:44.583 --> 50:46.334
Just tell her we went to Chuck E. Cheese.

50:46.418 --> 50:47.461
That's cool.

50:48.170 --> 50:52.049
Since we're here
and there are naked ladies everywhere,

50:52.924 --> 50:53.925
you got any questions?

50:54.634 --> 50:55.635
About girls?

50:56.053 --> 50:57.345
The birds and the bees?

50:57.679 --> 50:59.306
You're not my dad, asshole.

50:59.806 --> 51:01.641
Fair enough. Duly noted.

51:02.350 --> 51:03.810
But I should also point out,

51:03.894 --> 51:06.646
I know I'm not your dad.
I don't want to be your dad.

51:07.105 --> 51:08.523
[Coffee] No offense, I just...

51:08.607 --> 51:11.651
I'm terrified at the idea of having kids.

51:11.735 --> 51:13.737
I'm just afraid I would be a bad father...

51:14.738 --> 51:18.408
and I actually think there's a lot of
evidence for that right now.

51:18.492 --> 51:20.494
It's just I don't know how...

51:21.036 --> 51:22.329
to be a parent.

51:22.412 --> 51:23.997
Your mom is incredible.

51:24.081 --> 51:27.876
I just... I don't get it.
I didn't have good role models.

51:27.959 --> 51:30.087
Remember when I told you about my stepdad?

51:30.629 --> 51:32.756
-I lied.
-Yeah, no shit.

51:32.839 --> 51:34.883
No, I mean I had a stepdad.

51:34.966 --> 51:37.010
I just... We weren't best friends.

51:38.762 --> 51:41.139
He was a pretty big piece of shit,
actually.

51:41.681 --> 51:43.350
Treated my mom like garbage.

51:45.644 --> 51:47.395
Pushed me around a lot, you know.

51:48.522 --> 51:50.565
We had to call the cops on him. A lot.

51:51.066 --> 51:52.692
That's actually how I met Hill.

51:52.776 --> 51:57.114
He used to come in there...
scare the shit out of my stepdad.

51:58.406 --> 51:59.908
And that's why I became a cop.

52:02.828 --> 52:04.371
Can I tell you something, Coffee?

52:04.830 --> 52:06.873
Yeah! Yeah, of course. Anything.

52:08.750 --> 52:11.378
About two weeks ago,
I shot my first load.

52:12.170 --> 52:13.004
Excuse me?

52:13.088 --> 52:16.424
Ejaculated.
Blew my nose out of my dick. Come on, man.

52:16.508 --> 52:18.135
Yeah, I know what it is.

52:18.760 --> 52:20.303
It's just that you're 12.

52:20.387 --> 52:23.598
I saw this post on Reddit
about the clit-osaurus,

52:23.682 --> 52:26.685
and how it’s like a 100 dicks
in one little button.

52:26.768 --> 52:28.728
I need to press that button, Coffee.

52:28.812 --> 52:31.606
You need to stay off of Reddit, okay?

52:31.690 --> 52:33.650
And when it comes to women,
forget about the body!

52:34.401 --> 52:36.903
There’s so much more to women
than just sex.

52:36.987 --> 52:40.699
Just find somebody
who is your real friend and partner.

52:41.867 --> 52:42.951
That’s the jackpot.

52:43.493 --> 52:46.329
To be honest,
women scare the shit out of me.

52:46.413 --> 52:48.039
I mean, where do you even start?

52:48.123 --> 52:49.207
That's a great question.

52:49.291 --> 52:51.710
You got to just be genuine. Be yourself.

52:51.793 --> 52:53.044
But also be curious,

52:53.128 --> 52:56.548
ask them about themselves,
find out what their interests are.

52:57.048 --> 52:58.967
Right? Hey, excuse me.

52:59.467 --> 53:02.512
My friend here
would like to practice with a lady.

53:02.971 --> 53:06.266
The Champagne room's $150,
but that doesn't include extras.

53:06.349 --> 53:08.685
I meant practice talking with a lady.

53:08.768 --> 53:10.645
Well, you know, money talks, too, sweetie.

53:10.854 --> 53:12.272
Of course.

53:12.355 --> 53:15.817
Yes, and here you go.
You accept change, right?

53:18.153 --> 53:19.404
What's your name, sugar?

53:22.324 --> 53:25.243
-Umm, Kareem, what's yours?
-Thursday.

53:26.328 --> 53:27.871
Tell me about yourself, Thursday.

53:27.954 --> 53:29.414
I was born and raised in Detroit

53:29.497 --> 53:31.249
and I have an associate's degree
in biology

53:31.333 --> 53:33.043
and I'm studying to be a veterinarian.

53:34.002 --> 53:36.713
Hmm, that's interesting.
What do you do for fun?

53:36.796 --> 53:40.217
I like to jog.
I'm really into <i>CSI: New York.</i>

53:40.300 --> 53:42.010
I love me some Gary Sinise.

53:42.093 --> 53:43.386
Sinise is the best.

53:44.137 --> 53:45.347
How much to look at your pussy?

53:45.430 --> 53:46.348
Five dollars.

53:46.431 --> 53:49.059
No. What? Did you hear anything I said?

53:49.142 --> 53:51.269
-What the fuck is going on here?
-[Coffee] Hill!

53:51.353 --> 53:53.063
Thank God you're here. Listen...

53:53.438 --> 53:56.900
I have video evidence on this phone
that I did not kill Choi.

53:57.734 --> 54:00.570
Also, I know it's impossible to believe,
but...

54:01.112 --> 54:02.489
Detective Watts is dirty.

54:02.572 --> 54:04.115
Nastier than shit.

54:04.199 --> 54:07.869
Oh, my God, what? Watts is the bad guy?

54:08.328 --> 54:09.162
Why is she here?

54:09.246 --> 54:11.081
All right, everybody! Show’s over!

54:11.164 --> 54:13.291
[Watts] It’s police business.
I have to respectfully,

54:13.375 --> 54:14.876
woman to woman, ask you to leave!

54:14.960 --> 54:16.378
-[Watts] Gotta go home.
-She's dirty.

54:16.461 --> 54:20.215
Get the fuck out of here!
Get the fuck out!

54:20.298 --> 54:22.717
Go home! Work on your marriages!

54:23.134 --> 54:24.177
Jesus!

54:24.261 --> 54:26.888
Okay, you two. Let's take a walk out back.

54:27.389 --> 54:28.598
Not so fast, Watts.

54:28.932 --> 54:30.725
Yeah, that's what's up.

54:30.809 --> 54:32.185
Drop the gun, Coffee.

54:33.603 --> 54:36.022
What? This fucking guy?

54:36.106 --> 54:37.023
He's dirty?

54:38.984 --> 54:40.527
You and you are dirty?

54:40.610 --> 54:42.612
[Watts] Honestly,
Hill wanted to include you

54:42.696 --> 54:46.449
and he suggested it, and I laughed for,
like, ten minutes.

54:46.533 --> 54:48.243
I'm sorry, Coffee.

54:50.161 --> 54:51.830
[Hill] I tried dropping hints.

54:51.913 --> 54:54.624
Remember when you asked me
how could I afford that Jaguar,

54:54.708 --> 54:56.209
and I told you drug money?

54:56.793 --> 54:57.919
Yeah, that was a good hint.

54:58.003 --> 55:00.588
[Hill] When I took that kilo home,
it wasn't to analyze it.

55:01.089 --> 55:02.465
I love cocaine.

55:02.757 --> 55:04.009
I do it all the time.

55:04.259 --> 55:06.177
You came back with test results.

55:06.261 --> 55:09.139
I can give you test results.
I'm higher than a motherfucker right now!

55:09.222 --> 55:10.223
I like it.

55:10.307 --> 55:11.808
I guess I'm the asshole.

55:11.891 --> 55:14.728
Wise up. This is Detroit, baby.

55:14.811 --> 55:15.687
[Hill] The--

55:15.770 --> 55:17.355
-[Coffee] No!
-[Kareem] Shit!

55:17.439 --> 55:19.691
More for me! I get a bigger share.

55:19.774 --> 55:20.775
You're crazy.

55:20.859 --> 55:24.529
Yeah, I just killed the person
I’m in cahoots with. It’s intentional.

55:24.612 --> 55:27.032
All right, Linda, think.
How’s this gonna work?

55:27.115 --> 55:30.994
[exhales] You let Orlando escape custody
because you're working with him.

55:31.077 --> 55:33.330
When the kid saw you kill Choi,
you killed him and his mom,

55:33.413 --> 55:35.040
and you killed Hill! You killed everyone.

55:35.123 --> 55:37.667
And, ooh! My guys are already
at that shit motel

55:37.751 --> 55:41.171
where you’re hiding your mother,
so... pretty good at this.

55:41.254 --> 55:42.547
You forgot one thing, Watts.

55:42.630 --> 55:45.550
-Mhm?
-If I killed Kareem, then why...

55:46.259 --> 55:48.470
That actually... Yeah, shit.
That's airtight.

55:49.471 --> 55:51.765
What's up, little man?
You look like you're about to cry.

55:51.848 --> 55:53.850
[Watts] Don't worry.
You'll be with your mom soon.

55:53.933 --> 55:57.604
In heaven. But you’ll be together,
if you believe in that. I don’t.

55:57.979 --> 55:59.272
Don't do this.

55:59.647 --> 56:00.732
Close your eyes, kid.

56:01.399 --> 56:02.567
I don't want to.

56:03.693 --> 56:04.778
Close your eyes.

56:05.195 --> 56:08.865
[tense music builds]

56:08.948 --> 56:10.867
[sighs heavily]

56:10.950 --> 56:12.160
[Coffee] Run![

56:13.370 --> 56:14.371
[Watts] Fuck you!

56:16.039 --> 56:17.290
Where's the fucking kid?

56:18.625 --> 56:19.501
Fuck!

56:19.918 --> 56:20.794
[Watts] My eyes!

56:20.877 --> 56:24.005
Kareem! Where are you, you little shit?

56:24.089 --> 56:25.632
-[Coffee] Run, Kareem!
-[Watts] Kareem!

56:26.383 --> 56:27.384
Fuck!

56:27.467 --> 56:28.301
[Coffee groans]

56:28.385 --> 56:29.803
Get up, motherfucker!

56:31.971 --> 56:33.431
Where the fuck are you?

56:35.266 --> 56:37.644
[Coffee grunts and groans]

56:38.478 --> 56:39.312
Fuck.

56:39.896 --> 56:43.650
All right, little man. One-time offer.
You come out now,

56:43.733 --> 56:45.944
hey, we could put the blame
on this motherfucker,

56:46.027 --> 56:47.695
and you and your mom can go free!

56:48.071 --> 56:48.988
[Coffee] Don't listen!

56:49.072 --> 56:52.575
-You have three seconds to decide.
-[Coffee] Don't listen to her!

56:52.659 --> 56:53.493
One.

56:54.702 --> 56:55.662
Two.

56:55.745 --> 56:57.080
Oh, shit!

56:58.248 --> 57:01.543
[Kareem] Shit!
[screams]

57:02.669 --> 57:03.503
[Coffee grunts]

57:03.878 --> 57:04.879
Sorry!

57:05.588 --> 57:07.298
[Coffee coughs]

57:08.216 --> 57:09.259
Come on, get in!

57:09.634 --> 57:11.886
I haven't got time for that shit.
Get the fuck in!

57:11.970 --> 57:13.138
[Coffee moans]

57:13.221 --> 57:15.432
[tires squeal]

57:16.015 --> 57:19.185
[Orlando] Hello? Is anybody there?
Can anybody please help me!

57:19.269 --> 57:20.228
Please help me!

57:20.895 --> 57:22.564
Oh, no, please don't shoot me!

57:22.647 --> 57:26.192
Oh, Watts! I'm so glad to see you.
Listen, Coffee held me hostage.

57:26.276 --> 57:27.902
Man, this motherfucker's crazy.

57:28.486 --> 57:31.406
Get out of the fucking trunk!
You're driving.

57:31.906 --> 57:33.241
[heavy rock music]

57:33.324 --> 57:34.325
[both screaming]

57:37.704 --> 57:39.038
[horn honks]

57:39.122 --> 57:40.081
Slow down! I’m dying!

57:40.165 --> 57:42.750
If you die on me, Coffee,
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

57:42.834 --> 57:44.419
They have my fucking Mom!

57:45.879 --> 57:47.422
You're gonna kill us both!
Use the brake!

57:47.505 --> 57:49.591
-Which one is that?
-It's the one on the left!

1:07:22.621 --> 1:07:25.833
Oh, this is a different one
than the one in my squad car.

1:07:25.916 --> 1:07:27.960
-[Watts] It's the same.
-It's a different brand radio.

1:07:28.044 --> 1:07:29.628
I don't know. Does this sound okay?

1:07:29.712 --> 1:07:30.671
[grunt and yelp]

1:07:30.755 --> 1:07:31.672
It's still too close.

1:07:31.756 --> 1:07:33.716
[Coffee] Yeah, this radio's
very sensitive.

1:07:34.133 --> 1:07:35.801
-<i>Is that better?</i>
-That's better.

1:07:36.343 --> 1:07:37.470
[Coffee] <i>Okay, great.</i>

1:07:37.928 --> 1:07:41.474
-[Coffee] <i>Send over the woman and child.</i>
-No! Get the fuck out of the car.

1:07:41.599 --> 1:07:42.850
[Coffee] <i>Not until they're safe.</i>

1:07:42.933 --> 1:07:45.728
I trade my life for theirs,
that's the deal.

1:07:45.811 --> 1:07:51.025
The deal is, they’re gonna walk over
after you get out of the fucking car.

1:07:51.108 --> 1:07:52.735
[Coffee] <i>I feel we're on different pages.</i>

1:07:52.818 --> 1:07:56.864
<i>I think that if I get halfway there,</i>
<i>then you can release them.</i>

1:07:56.947 --> 1:07:58.449
<i>Then I will come the rest of the way.</i>

1:07:58.532 --> 1:08:01.869
That’s like a Helen Keller square dance
that I don’t wanna be a part of.

1:08:01.952 --> 1:08:06.248
<i>Okay, let’s hear your idea. Give me</i>
<i>a proposal and I’ll give you a counter.</i>

1:08:06.332 --> 1:08:11.420
You get out of the fucking car
or I give this child a 600-week abortion.

1:08:11.504 --> 1:08:12.338
Okay?

1:08:13.422 --> 1:08:14.381
<i>If they die...</i>

1:08:15.841 --> 1:08:16.801
<i>we all die.</i>

1:08:18.719 --> 1:08:22.264
You don't have the balls
to pull some gangster shit, Coffee.

1:08:22.765 --> 1:08:24.141
I got the balls, Watts.

1:08:28.562 --> 1:08:29.438
[moans]

1:08:30.856 --> 1:08:31.690
I got a...

1:08:32.316 --> 1:08:35.361
couple of big, green, oval-shaped balls.

1:08:35.861 --> 1:08:37.238
[all] What?

1:08:37.321 --> 1:08:38.239
Grenades!

1:08:39.198 --> 1:08:40.699
Okay? I'm talking about grenades.

1:08:40.783 --> 1:08:42.827
-[Orlando] Holy shit, he got grenades!
-[Vanessa] God!

1:08:42.910 --> 1:08:46.539
No. Guys, do not be scared.
He's bluffing.

1:08:46.664 --> 1:08:47.957
These grenades are real.

1:08:48.040 --> 1:08:51.001
They're not. This is a man
who jerks off to Glenn Close.

1:08:51.085 --> 1:08:53.170
We're safe. We've never been safer.

1:08:53.796 --> 1:08:54.964
You know what's funny?

1:08:56.423 --> 1:08:59.718
I didn't think I actually had
the grenades to end all this...

1:09:00.553 --> 1:09:04.014
but Kareem made me realize
I've had the grenades all along.

1:09:04.598 --> 1:09:06.767
I just needed something
worth fighting for.

1:09:07.393 --> 1:09:08.853
-[grenade hits the ground]
-[screams]

1:09:08.936 --> 1:09:11.021
That was a good shot!

1:09:11.105 --> 1:09:13.107
Fuck! Run! Run!

1:09:13.190 --> 1:09:14.817
[all screaming]

1:09:18.529 --> 1:09:19.738
I ain't afraid of no grenade--

1:09:19.989 --> 1:09:21.490
[all screaming]

1:09:21.574 --> 1:09:23.492
-[grenade drops]
-[Coffee] Shit!

1:09:25.327 --> 1:09:28.205
[ringing]
[sound muffled]

1:09:28.289 --> 1:09:31.333
[Watts] No!

1:09:31.417 --> 1:09:33.210
My drugs!

1:09:33.294 --> 1:09:36.130
-Oh, shit!
-My fucking drugs!

1:09:36.547 --> 1:09:37.631
[Vanessa whispering]

1:09:38.382 --> 1:09:39.216
[Rodney] Gross.

1:09:39.300 --> 1:09:42.052
[Watts] We gotta get it pushed through
in 5 minutes! We’ll clean it up.

1:09:42.136 --> 1:09:44.096
Let’s pack this and move it in!

1:09:44.180 --> 1:09:47.308
The Canadians are coming,
so, still wanna make a good impression!

1:09:48.058 --> 1:09:48.893
[Watts] Orlando?

1:09:49.643 --> 1:09:52.229
You find that fucking family
and you execute them all.

1:09:54.148 --> 1:09:55.274
Hey, Orlando,

1:09:55.357 --> 1:09:57.484
-can I get you a sandwich?
-[Orlando] I don't...

1:09:57.568 --> 1:10:00.029
Just grab two pieces of bread
with a tampon in the middle of it?

1:10:00.237 --> 1:10:01.363
-I don't...
-For your pussy.

1:10:01.447 --> 1:10:02.448
I'm not... What?

1:10:02.531 --> 1:10:05.284
My man Rodney.
I think you deserve a promotion.

1:10:05.367 --> 1:10:08.037
And I’m gonna need you to set
a precedent high up there

1:10:08.120 --> 1:10:10.122
by murdering a child and his mother.

1:10:10.206 --> 1:10:14.001
Yes! Finally! Finally, fuck! Yes!

1:10:14.084 --> 1:10:15.586
-[Watts] Yes.
-[Rodney] Thank you!

1:10:15.669 --> 1:10:17.254
This couldn’t have come at a better time.

1:10:17.338 --> 1:10:20.090
My colleagues were bullying me.
I told them it’s time that I’m a leader.

1:10:20.174 --> 1:10:22.635
Make it look like
Coffee murder-suicided it.

1:10:23.510 --> 1:10:25.930
You heard what she said.
Step to it, bitch.

1:10:26.013 --> 1:10:26.889
Fuck you.

1:10:27.139 --> 1:10:29.475
See? That's the bullying
I'm talking about.

1:10:30.100 --> 1:10:33.354
-I'm sorry I doubted your balls, Coffee.
-That's okay.

1:10:33.437 --> 1:10:35.856
-[Vanessa] That's a dead end.
-[Kareem] This way.

1:10:40.277 --> 1:10:42.071
[Orlando] Hey!
Where you think y'all are going?

1:10:42.154 --> 1:10:43.989
[Coffee] Shit.
You don't wanna do this, Orlando.

1:10:44.073 --> 1:10:45.366
You think I'm doing this for fun?

1:10:45.449 --> 1:10:47.284
I can see you’ve been through a lot.

1:10:47.368 --> 1:10:49.578
Now, look. We can all get out of here
together and alive.

1:10:49.662 --> 1:10:50.746
Fuck this.

1:10:53.249 --> 1:10:56.126
Orlando, this isn't you.
This is not like you at all.

1:10:56.210 --> 1:10:58.587
-You don't know me, lady.
-I do know. A mother knows.

1:10:58.671 --> 1:11:00.631
-I know that you're scared.
-That's right, Mom.

1:11:00.923 --> 1:11:02.508
You a bitch, man! You a bitch!

1:11:02.591 --> 1:11:03.842
Shut up. You don’t know shit.

1:11:03.926 --> 1:11:06.095
You just a little-ass kid
with little-ass kid nuts!

1:11:06.178 --> 1:11:09.848
Hey, hey! You are a bitch. Watts is
fucking you in the face right now.

1:11:09.932 --> 1:11:12.059
-Cause you a bitch!
-Who a bitch? Me? You a bitch!

1:11:12.142 --> 1:11:15.104
-You don’t kill shit, motherfucker!
-Don’t you call me a bitch!

1:11:15.187 --> 1:11:17.523
-Don’t you call me a bitch.
-You're being a bitch.

1:11:17.606 --> 1:11:18.774
Both of y'all some bitches.

1:11:18.857 --> 1:11:21.652
Shut the fuck up already!
All right. Jesus!

1:11:22.194 --> 1:11:25.406
The level of insecurity with you guys
is unbelievable.

1:11:25.489 --> 1:11:26.615
"I’m a bitch, you’re a bitch!

1:11:26.699 --> 1:11:29.785
No, I got a big dick!
No, my big dick hangs low like King Kong."

1:11:29.868 --> 1:11:31.787
Shut the fuck up with all the posturing!

1:11:31.870 --> 1:11:34.957
No one is as tough as they say they are.
You're all soft!

1:11:35.040 --> 1:11:38.711
And Orlando,
you’re not gonna shoot anybody, okay?

1:11:38.794 --> 1:11:41.964
I see you. I see straight through you.
You’re just like my son.

1:11:42.715 --> 1:11:43.841
'Cause we both gangster?

1:11:43.924 --> 1:11:45.759
No! No, because you’re a good boy.

1:11:45.843 --> 1:11:48.929
Both of you, you’re good boys.
You’re just insecure as hell,

1:11:49.013 --> 1:11:51.849
and so you put on these tough acts
to protect yourself from getting hurt.

1:11:51.932 --> 1:11:55.436
But, hey, I have a plan.
Why don’t we put our egos aside?

1:11:55.519 --> 1:11:56.645
And get the fuck out of here

1:11:56.729 --> 1:11:58.939
because  your crazy-ass boss
is gonna kill us all!

1:12:05.279 --> 1:12:06.697
Shit, man!

1:12:07.448 --> 1:12:09.450
Goddamn!

1:12:10.993 --> 1:12:12.077
Fucking soft.

1:12:12.745 --> 1:12:14.288
I ain’t never shot nobody in my life.

1:12:14.371 --> 1:12:17.583
-That's okay. I'm soft, too.
-Yeah, we know that, James.

1:12:17.666 --> 1:12:19.668
I just wanted to do the music.
Now, all of a sudden,

1:12:19.752 --> 1:12:22.212
I’ve got to live up to some shit
I said on track when I was 17?

1:12:22.838 --> 1:12:25.507
Fucking tired of this shit, man!
I’m always anxious, you know?

1:12:26.175 --> 1:12:27.801
-I wanted to be a dentist.
-That's amazing.

1:12:27.885 --> 1:12:29.261
I wanted to fix people's teeth.

1:12:29.345 --> 1:12:31.263
-You got the teeth for it.
-Thank you.

1:12:31.597 --> 1:12:34.224
-Let's just get the fuck out of here.
-Right, let's go. Follow me.

1:12:34.641 --> 1:12:35.851
This looks good, right?

1:12:35.934 --> 1:12:38.062
Show of hands.
Who thinks this is noticeable?

1:12:39.313 --> 1:12:40.814
[Watts] Yeah, it's not good.

1:12:41.482 --> 1:12:42.483
Here we go.

1:12:42.816 --> 1:12:44.193
[Watts] Welcome. <i>Bienvenue.</i>

1:12:44.276 --> 1:12:45.527
[laughs] Hi.

1:12:45.944 --> 1:12:47.112
Madame Watts.

1:12:47.196 --> 1:12:51.116
[trying to speak French]

1:12:51.492 --> 1:12:52.534
I thought I could fake it.

1:12:52.618 --> 1:12:55.704
I thought I could just start saying stuff
and you guys would respond,

1:12:55.788 --> 1:12:57.122
but I guess it's a real language.

1:12:57.748 --> 1:12:59.208
Anyway, do we have a deal?

1:12:59.833 --> 1:13:03.087
No fucking way. Look at that shit.
[laughs]

1:13:03.170 --> 1:13:04.588
Why is it all burny?

1:13:05.005 --> 1:13:06.340
-Burny?
-It's burnt.

1:13:06.423 --> 1:13:08.926
Like you roasted this
over a fucking campfire,

1:13:09.009 --> 1:13:10.260
singing songs and shit.

1:13:10.761 --> 1:13:14.598
Though charred on the outside...
this will fuck you up, I promise.

1:13:14.681 --> 1:13:18.852
It's artisanal. We took a classic
and just set it on fire.

1:13:18.936 --> 1:13:22.106
It's kind of like a coke brûlée. See?
[sniffs]

1:13:22.189 --> 1:13:25.776
Oh, my God. Like, I’ve done that before.

1:13:26.276 --> 1:13:27.403
[sniffs]

1:13:27.486 --> 1:13:31.115
Feelings, concerns, initial reactions?
What notes are you getting?

1:13:31.198 --> 1:13:32.449
[Boss sniffs] Oh.

1:13:33.158 --> 1:13:34.868
That's terrible.
[laughs]

1:13:34.952 --> 1:13:37.371
So, do we have a deal?
[laughs nervously]

1:13:37.454 --> 1:13:40.040
[Watts] No need to look at it.
Just look right here.

1:13:40.499 --> 1:13:42.709
[whispering] Okay, so is there
any other way out of here?

1:13:42.793 --> 1:13:43.919
[whispering] No, this is it.

1:13:44.795 --> 1:13:46.672
-That's the French dude.
-Yeah.

1:13:47.005 --> 1:13:51.009
So because I like you
and I feel like we could be friends,

1:13:51.093 --> 1:13:55.139
Uh, ten percent.
Ten percent discount to move this today.

1:13:55.806 --> 1:13:58.350
Uh, fifteen fucking percent.

1:13:58.434 --> 1:13:59.977
You're fucking me around.

1:14:00.060 --> 1:14:03.021
I bet we can sneak out
while they're distracted by the deal.

1:14:03.105 --> 1:14:04.314
That's a good idea.

1:14:04.731 --> 1:14:06.233
It's 18,5, and that’s it.

1:14:06.316 --> 1:14:09.903
Standing at my power
at 19% and no fucking further.

1:14:09.987 --> 1:14:14.366
Twenty-five percent, cause I need
to go home and watch a Nancy Meyers movie

1:14:14.450 --> 1:14:15.576
and erase this day.

1:14:15.993 --> 1:14:17.327
Twenty-five percent, huh?

1:14:19.830 --> 1:14:20.831
[mumbles in French]

1:14:21.623 --> 1:14:22.458
Okay.

1:14:22.541 --> 1:14:25.919
-[French man] We're good.
-Thank you so much. Fuck off.

1:14:26.003 --> 1:14:28.881
Here's the money! I’m so excited.

1:14:28.964 --> 1:14:30.799
[megaphone]
<i>This is the Detroit Metro Police.</i>

1:14:30.883 --> 1:14:31.925
<i>We have you surrounded.</i>

1:14:32.009 --> 1:14:33.510
-[Watts] No!
-You set us up!

1:14:33.594 --> 1:14:35.137
I'm taking what's mine!

1:14:35.220 --> 1:14:38.515
Why don’t we just wait for them to finish
shooting each other, and we just walk out?

1:14:38.599 --> 1:14:40.225
[Watts] Listen you French fucks,

1:14:40.309 --> 1:14:43.395
I know you’re just finding out
about feminism and lung cancer,

1:14:43.479 --> 1:14:46.565
but I’m taking the money!
This is mine, you motherfuckers!

1:14:46.648 --> 1:14:49.151
-Put a bullet right in your forehead.
-[shakily] No.

1:14:49.735 --> 1:14:50.903
-Down, Stein!
-[screams]

1:15:02.915 --> 1:15:04.833
-What the fuck?
-Sorry!

1:15:04.917 --> 1:15:07.920
[gunfire]

1:15:12.007 --> 1:15:13.425
[distant sirens]

1:15:13.509 --> 1:15:14.843
[explosion]

1:15:14.927 --> 1:15:16.136
[Kareem yells]

1:15:16.220 --> 1:15:18.138
We all make mistakes!

1:15:22.476 --> 1:15:23.769
[Coffee] Okay, here's the plan.

1:15:23.852 --> 1:15:27.523
Orlando and I, we run out guns blazing.
Create a diversion.

1:15:27.606 --> 1:15:30.317
But I promise, we're all going to
make it out of here alive.

1:15:30.776 --> 1:15:34.071
Most of us. At least half of us
are going to make it out of here alive.

1:15:34.154 --> 1:15:36.615
-[Vanessa] Why would you say that?
-[Kareem] Which fucking half?

1:15:36.698 --> 1:15:38.075
You're right. It's not a good plan.

1:15:38.158 --> 1:15:41.245
I gotta say, man, if you die,
I’d be pretty pissed.

1:15:41.828 --> 1:15:42.746
I love you, too.

1:15:42.829 --> 1:15:43.956
I ain't saying all that now.

1:15:44.039 --> 1:15:45.207
Yeah, but I get it.

1:15:45.290 --> 1:15:48.043
-Aren't you trained for shit like this?
-Let's do this.

1:15:48.126 --> 1:15:49.753
[epic music]

1:15:49.836 --> 1:15:55.551
[Coffee shouting]

1:15:56.260 --> 1:15:58.679
[Vanessa and Kareem shouting]

1:16:01.098 --> 1:16:04.935
-[Coffee in slow motion] Shit!
-[Kareem in slow motion] Coffee!

1:16:06.562 --> 1:16:07.688
[Orlando] Come on, let's go!

1:16:11.483 --> 1:16:13.569
-[Vanessa] Don't shoot us!
-[Police] Hold your fire!
