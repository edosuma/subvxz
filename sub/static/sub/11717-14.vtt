Back in the day,
this used to be my beat.

00:26.683 --> 00:28.834
- District 5.
- Mm-hmm.

00:28.886 --> 00:31.904
Every good cop
knows his neighborhood.

00:31.972 --> 00:33.773
I used to spend 60-plus hours
a week here,

00:33.840 --> 00:36.342
and most of it
was to get to know the people.

00:36.410 --> 00:38.527
- Earn their trust, right?
- Mm-hmm.

00:38.612 --> 00:39.912
If people trust you,

00:39.980 --> 00:41.614
then they'll open up
when the time comes.

00:56.580 --> 00:57.863

from here.

01:06.673 --> 01:07.556
Can we go?

01:07.641 --> 01:08.874
Well, you got the badge

01:08.942 --> 01:11.210

04:27.564 --> 04:29.265
So, uh, what is this?

04:29.333 --> 04:30.366
I, uh, I've been looking

04:30.417 --> 04:32.935
for a master cylinder
for my dad's car.

04:33.003 --> 04:35.171
That piece of junk
in the garage?

04:35.238 --> 04:38.474
Hey, all right,
that piece of junk in the garage

04:38.542 --> 04:39.709
was my dad's pride and joy,

04:39.777 --> 04:41.210
and he bought it for us
to fix up together.

04:41.261 --> 04:42.445
We just never got around to it.

04:42.513 --> 04:43.579
Okay.

04:43.647 --> 04:45.264
So you thinking
about getting it started again?

04:45.349 --> 04:46.716
Yeah, I'm doing okay, too.

04:46.767 --> 04:48.551
I found this place in Iowa that
do parts for Mercury Marquis,

04:48.602 --> 04:50.453
so, you know...

04:52.589 --> 04:54.524
Man.

04:54.591 --> 04:56.292
You know,
I am not a gearhead,

04:56.360 --> 04:59.128
but that does not look like
a master cylinder to me.

04:59.196 --> 05:02.365
Yeah, that's because
it's a clutch plate.

05:02.433 --> 05:03.366
Do me a favor.

05:03.434 --> 05:05.535
Am I crazy
or does that say

05:05.602 --> 05:09.989
"1974 master cylinder
for a Mercury Marquis"?

05:10.074 --> 05:11.207
You bought it online?

05:11.275 --> 05:13.343
Yeah, I bought... Why?

05:13.410 --> 05:14.877
What, are you a schmuck?
What's the matter with you?

05:14.945 --> 05:16.346
You don't order anything
off the Internet.

05:16.413 --> 05:17.664
Danny, it's the 21st century.

05:17.748 --> 05:19.482
Says the guy with
no master cylinder.

05:19.550 --> 05:20.516
All right, you got a point.

05:24.054 --> 05:25.688

05:25.756 --> 05:26.923

<i>CHiPs.</i> Reminds me of <i>CHiPs.</i>

05:44.608 --> 05:45.541
You remember <i>CHiPs?</i>

05:45.609 --> 05:46.943
Of course I
remember <i>CHiPs.</i>

05:46.994 --> 05:48.828
You know I always thought that
would be the sweetest gig.

05:48.912 --> 05:50.480
You get to ride a
motorcycle all day,

05:50.547 --> 05:52.181

you go on chases.

05:52.249 --> 05:54.517
No, n-no, you know, the
mortality rate for motor cops

05:54.585 --> 05:56.318
is five times higher
than regular people.

05:56.370 --> 05:58.254
Danny, it's a
TV cop fantasy.

05:58.322 --> 05:59.622
Why you got to ruin
it with statistics?

05:59.673 --> 06:01.124
All right, fine,
it's a TV cop fantasy.

06:01.191 --> 06:02.191
In my TV cop fantasy,

06:02.259 --> 06:04.010
I am Erik Estrada,
you're the other guy.

06:04.094 --> 06:05.161
I don't think so, baby.

06:05.229 --> 06:06.396
What do we got?

06:06.463 --> 06:08.681
HPD says it started as
a routine traffic stop,

06:08.766 --> 06:10.550
then the kid gunned
it and took off.

06:10.634 --> 06:12.385
Is he alive?
Barely.

06:12.469 --> 06:13.686
EMS took a while
to stabilize him.

06:13.771 --> 06:15.938
They're working
on getting him out now.

06:16.006 --> 06:16.856
DANNY:
Got an I.D.?

06:16.940 --> 06:18.574
Not yet, but, uh,

06:18.642 --> 06:20.893
we ran the plates and found
out the car's a rental.

06:20.978 --> 06:22.895
Kono's reaching out right now
to the car rental company

06:22.980 --> 06:23.896
to get the driver's info.

06:23.981 --> 06:24.914
Wait a second.

06:24.982 --> 06:26.032
Call said this was
a crime scene.

06:26.116 --> 06:27.533
This looks
like a traffic accident.

06:27.618 --> 06:29.919
Well, we're here because
it's about to get interesting.

06:29.987 --> 06:31.070
We got a John Doe.

06:31.155 --> 06:32.705
Actually, scratch that--

06:32.790 --> 06:34.373
we got part of a John Doe.

06:37.628 --> 06:40.163
What it is, Max?

06:41.415 --> 06:43.365
Holy geez.

06:43.417 --> 06:44.700
Something you don't see
every day.

06:44.752 --> 06:45.918
MAX: White male,
approximately 30.

06:46.003 --> 06:47.970
Cloudiness of the cornea
puts T.O.D.

06:48.038 --> 06:49.739
at about six to eight hours ago.

06:49.807 --> 06:51.557
There's not a lot of blood
in the box.

06:51.642 --> 06:53.542
Minimal capillary hemorrhaging
indicates

06:53.594 --> 06:54.894
postmortem dismemberment.

06:54.978 --> 06:56.562
You'll notice the
irregular marks

06:56.647 --> 06:58.064
alongside the
posterior surface

06:58.148 --> 06:59.599
of the C3 vertebra.

06:59.683 --> 07:00.983
Really, Steve?

07:01.051 --> 07:02.852
Most likely caused by a saw.

07:02.903 --> 07:05.054
You ever see
anything like this before?

07:05.122 --> 07:08.191
Murder and mutilation, uh,
as an isolated incident, no.

07:08.242 --> 07:09.575
It's a serial killer thing.

07:09.660 --> 07:10.827
Well, the head
could be a trophy.

07:10.894 --> 07:12.228
They just pulled the driver out,
but EMS

07:12.279 --> 07:13.780
doesn't think
he's going to make it.

07:13.864 --> 07:15.498
Hey, guys.

07:20.204 --> 07:22.121
What's your name?

07:22.206 --> 07:23.289
Look, we found the head.

07:23.373 --> 07:24.957
Okay, why'd you kill him?

07:25.042 --> 07:26.209
Who is he?
Just give me a name.

07:26.260 --> 07:27.210
Who is the guy?

07:27.261 --> 07:28.911
Ming-húa.

07:28.962 --> 07:31.931
What did he say?
Ming-húa-- it's a name in Mandarin.

07:32.015 --> 07:33.132
Ming-húa.

07:33.217 --> 07:34.617
Ming-húa-- is that,
is that your name?

07:34.685 --> 07:35.685
Is that you?

07:35.752 --> 07:37.603
Is it the dead guy?
Who's Ming-húa?

07:37.688 --> 07:39.272
Tell me,
who's Ming-húa?

07:39.356 --> 07:41.357
Is it you?

07:42.926 --> 07:44.944
DANNY: Great, now we got
two John Does.

07:45.028 --> 07:47.113
And no answers.

07:59.084 --> 08:00.362
KONO: <i>Spoke to the rental car</i>
<i>company.</i>

08:00.810 --> 08:02.529
Turns out the renter
is a local.

08:02.796 --> 08:04.579
His name's
Spenser Owens.

08:04.631 --> 08:06.348
Okay, doesn't look
like Spenser's

08:06.416 --> 08:07.499
our driver
or our victim.

08:07.567 --> 08:08.784
KONO:
No, he's alive and well.

08:08.852 --> 08:11.186
No priors, not even
a speeding ticket in the system.

08:11.254 --> 08:13.188
HPD said he reported
the car stolen this morning,

08:13.256 --> 08:14.189
and I have officers

08:14.257 --> 08:15.557
bringing him over
for a statement.

08:15.608 --> 08:17.359
Let's just assume the driver
is the murderer, okay?

08:17.427 --> 08:20.095
He put a head in a box, he went
for a cruise in a stolen car.

08:20.146 --> 08:21.280
Where was he going?

08:21.364 --> 08:22.698
GPS was damaged
during the accident.

08:22.766 --> 08:24.316
Maybe I can pull
something off it, though.

08:24.401 --> 08:25.367
Get a point of origin,
destination.

08:25.435 --> 08:26.435
DANNY:
Hey.

08:26.503 --> 08:28.153
All right, so I ran
prints on our driver

08:28.238 --> 08:29.238
and the ones
found on the box

08:29.305 --> 08:30.272
through AFIS, TSA,
and Immigration,

08:30.340 --> 08:31.707
but I still came
up with nothing.

08:31.775 --> 08:33.442
CHIN:
Driver spoke Mandarin, right?

08:33.510 --> 08:34.743
Maybe he was illegal.

08:34.794 --> 08:35.977
That would explain why
he's not in the system.

08:36.046 --> 08:36.962
(sighs)

08:37.047 --> 08:38.881
Okay, what about
our John Doe #2?

08:38.948 --> 08:40.549
You mean Jack?

08:40.616 --> 08:41.650
You got an I.D.?

08:41.717 --> 08:45.587
No, Ja-- his head
was in a box-- Jack.

08:46.756 --> 08:48.157
That just ain't
right, bro.

08:48.224 --> 08:49.675
Too soon?
STEVE: Little bit.

08:49.759 --> 08:50.726
Okay, what do you know
about him?

08:50.794 --> 08:51.894
Uh, besides
the fact

08:51.961 --> 08:53.628
that his eyes were blue,
nothing, but Max said

08:53.680 --> 08:56.665
he's done posting the
body and the head, so...

08:56.733 --> 08:58.300
we should <i>head</i> over.

08:58.368 --> 08:59.818
Okay.
(Danny laughs)

08:59.903 --> 09:01.186
We need to I.D. these guys,
figure out what's going on.

09:01.271 --> 09:02.488
Chin, you take the car.

09:02.572 --> 09:05.024
Kono, talk to this Spenser
guy who rented the car.

09:05.108 --> 09:06.992
We'll go talk to Max.

09:07.077 --> 09:08.494
"Jack"?

09:08.578 --> 09:10.846
- You have zero sense of humor. Zero.
- That's not true.

09:10.914 --> 09:13.032
I... It's bad, Danny.

09:15.318 --> 09:17.252
KONO:
<i>Spenser,</i>

09:17.320 --> 09:18.837
you're a local.

09:18.922 --> 09:20.155
What are you doing
renting a car?

09:20.206 --> 09:21.690
Mine was in the shop.

09:21.758 --> 09:23.192
I've been working nights
on a loft conversion

09:23.259 --> 09:26.345
off Farrington, so I didn't
even realize the car was gone

09:26.429 --> 09:28.163
till I left work this morning.

09:28.231 --> 09:29.765
I see you filed
a police report.

09:29.832 --> 09:31.867
Yes, that's the first thing
I did.

09:31.935 --> 09:33.936
Report says that you left
the keys in the car.

09:34.003 --> 09:35.337
I'm an idiot.

09:35.405 --> 09:37.406
I lose everything,
so I left them under the visor.

09:37.474 --> 09:39.224
Did you also happen
to leave a box in the car

09:39.309 --> 09:40.442
before it was stolen?

09:40.510 --> 09:41.676
A box?

09:41.728 --> 09:44.513
No, I... I didn't leave
anything in the car.

09:44.564 --> 09:46.014
Did you use the GPS?

09:46.066 --> 09:48.650
No, I did not use the GPS.

09:48.718 --> 09:51.720
Look, can you please tell me
what's going on?

09:51.788 --> 09:52.955
Sure.

09:53.022 --> 09:53.789
We found your car.

09:53.857 --> 09:55.324
Great.

09:55.391 --> 09:57.092
You get the guy who stole it?

09:57.160 --> 09:58.794
Something like that.

09:58.861 --> 10:00.395
Do you recognize

10:00.463 --> 10:02.698
this man?

10:02.766 --> 10:04.866
No.

10:04.918 --> 10:06.802
What about him?

10:08.755 --> 10:10.672
Wow.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.091
No, ma'am.

10:12.175 --> 10:14.610
What about the name Ming-húa?

10:14.677 --> 10:17.379
Sorry.

10:17.447 --> 10:19.114
I-I wish I could be
of more help.

10:19.182 --> 10:20.766
Okay.

10:20.850 --> 10:22.835
Thank you.

10:30.276 --> 10:32.227
I ran your driver's
dental records.

10:32.278 --> 10:34.196
Cross-referenced
with the name Ming-húa.

10:34.264 --> 10:35.614
Nothing showed up in the system.

10:35.698 --> 10:37.099
I also talked
to my colleagues

10:37.167 --> 10:38.900
on the other islands,
and they report

10:38.952 --> 10:40.569
nothing in terms of similar M.O.

10:40.637 --> 10:41.904
Maybe it was his first kill.

10:41.971 --> 10:43.138
Yeah, either that
or he's done

10:43.206 --> 10:44.740
a good job of covering
his tracks so far.

10:44.808 --> 10:46.175
Doesn't the
HPD have

10:46.242 --> 10:48.260
a tattoo database
they use to I.D. suspects?

10:48.344 --> 10:50.179
Why, you don't think
that says "mom" in Chinese?

10:50.246 --> 10:51.446
Not exactly.

10:51.514 --> 10:52.447
It's Triad.

10:52.515 --> 10:53.915
This guy was
in a gang.

10:53.967 --> 10:55.250
Max, what else you got?

10:55.301 --> 10:58.353
Noticed traces of grease and
motor oil under his fingernails.

10:58.421 --> 10:59.621
DANNY: There's a lot
of wear and tear

10:59.689 --> 11:01.657
on his hands
for a guy his age.

11:01.724 --> 11:03.125
Yeah, signs of manual labor.

11:03.193 --> 11:05.260
Like hacking a guy's
head off with a saw?

11:05.328 --> 11:06.695
Obviously, for our...

11:06.763 --> 11:09.832
smaller victim, uh,
there were no fingerprints

11:09.899 --> 11:11.667
to be had
or identified.

11:11.734 --> 11:12.868
No hits on
the dental.

11:12.936 --> 11:14.319
But I did run blood
and tissue samples

11:14.404 --> 11:16.371
to Tox, as well
as reference samples to DNA.

11:16.439 --> 11:19.625
I will let you know
when I have those results.

11:19.709 --> 11:22.294
(sighs) Hey, I just got off
the phone with McGarrett.

11:22.378 --> 11:24.463
Still no I.D.s
on our two John Does.

11:24.547 --> 11:26.215
And I ran faces
through Missing Persons.

11:26.282 --> 11:27.549
Nothing there.
All right.

11:27.617 --> 11:29.501
What about the guy
who rented the car?

11:29.586 --> 11:32.454
Just your average victim
of an auto theft.

11:32.505 --> 11:33.722
Didn't give us anything useful.

11:33.790 --> 11:34.723
Have faith, cuz.

11:34.790 --> 11:37.726
The case is
hardly cold.

11:37.793 --> 11:39.344
What are you doing
with the GPS?

11:41.097 --> 11:42.181
Just watch.

11:42.265 --> 11:43.532
(computer beeping)

11:43.600 --> 11:45.800
(laughs)
It's alive.

11:45.852 --> 11:49.404
All right, let's see if we can
get any data off of it.

11:49.472 --> 11:51.673
(computer dings)
Ah. Ooh.

11:51.741 --> 11:53.975
All right, looks like there
was one address inputted--

11:54.027 --> 11:56.995
CHIN:
11878 Keawe Street.

11:57.080 --> 11:58.580
It's an office building--
couple dozen businesses,

11:58.648 --> 11:59.665
multiple employees.

11:59.749 --> 12:01.083
Here's a list.

12:02.952 --> 12:05.254
Now based on the time
the address was entered,

12:05.321 --> 12:08.323
I'd say Keawe Street was
our driver's final destination.

12:08.391 --> 12:10.008
No pun intended.
(phone ringing)

12:10.093 --> 12:11.826
Max, go ahead.
You're on speaker.

12:11.878 --> 12:15.364
In analyzing the isotope ratios
of oxygen and hydrogen

12:15.431 --> 12:17.266
in the driver's hair,

12:17.333 --> 12:19.601
I've linked him
to the drinking water supply

12:19.669 --> 12:20.569
in the Waipahu area.

12:20.637 --> 12:21.737
Wait. Spenser said

12:21.804 --> 12:23.555
his car was stolen
off of Farrington.

12:23.640 --> 12:25.540
That's right. Farrington
goes straight through Waipahu.

12:25.608 --> 12:26.708
That makes sense.
There's a pocket

12:26.776 --> 12:28.026
of Chinese immigrants
that lives right there.

12:28.111 --> 12:29.711
Great work, Max.
MAX: Thank you.

12:29.779 --> 12:31.280
How's your Mandarin?

12:31.347 --> 12:32.581
(speaks Mandarin)

12:34.317 --> 12:36.485
(crowd chatter)

12:44.761 --> 12:46.027
He recognize our vic?

12:46.079 --> 12:48.697
Yeah. He says the kid
comes in here all the time.

12:48.748 --> 12:50.198
He works at a salvage yard

12:50.266 --> 12:52.567
couple of blocks
down the street.

12:52.635 --> 12:54.636
(engine revving)

13:02.895 --> 13:05.213
Hey, you don't see many
of those

13:05.281 --> 13:06.381
on the island.

13:06.449 --> 13:09.101
What's this, a '57?

13:09.185 --> 13:10.452
(speaking Mandarin)

13:20.896 --> 13:22.364
Hey, you speak English?

13:24.033 --> 13:25.500
Yes.
We need to ask you

13:25.568 --> 13:27.235
some questions.

13:29.872 --> 13:32.307
My grandson, Ming-húa.

13:34.444 --> 13:35.544
<i>Ming-húa...</i>

13:35.611 --> 13:36.911
(speaking Mandarin)

13:38.047 --> 13:39.448
(sighs)

13:39.515 --> 13:40.549
(speaking Mandarin)

13:40.600 --> 13:42.918
Hey, Ming-húa.

13:45.288 --> 13:47.472
You like action figures? Huh?

13:47.557 --> 13:49.391
Me, too.

13:50.526 --> 13:52.627
Me, too, buddy.

13:52.695 --> 13:54.396
Wait a minute.

13:54.447 --> 13:56.398
I had one just like this.

13:56.449 --> 13:58.567
My dad got me one
just like this

13:58.618 --> 14:00.302
when I was about your age.

14:00.370 --> 14:02.771
Let's see
if we can fix him up here.

14:02.822 --> 14:03.822
(plastic clicks)
Dung.

14:03.906 --> 14:05.707
Good as new.

14:07.994 --> 14:09.544
Here you go.

14:14.784 --> 14:17.969
Sir, do you know
where the boy's father is?

14:23.026 --> 14:25.093
Is this him?

14:26.129 --> 14:28.397
What's happened?

14:31.200 --> 14:33.735
Where's my son?

14:43.713 --> 14:45.781
(man crying)

14:54.657 --> 14:55.924
Max.

15:00.830 --> 15:03.031
(crying)

15:05.168 --> 15:06.802
(heavy sigh)

15:09.439 --> 15:11.907
Mr. Chi, when you're ready,

15:11.974 --> 15:13.942
we'd like to ask you
some questions.

15:14.977 --> 15:17.446
(crying)

15:23.586 --> 15:26.088
Mr. Chi, we found

15:26.155 --> 15:28.123
your son in
a stolen car,

15:28.191 --> 15:30.859
the victim's head in a...
in a box.

15:30.927 --> 15:32.794
No.

15:32.862 --> 15:34.796
It's not possible.

15:34.864 --> 15:38.083
Han could never
do these things, no.

15:38.167 --> 15:40.051
What did Han do for work?

15:40.136 --> 15:43.405
He work for me... on cars.

15:43.473 --> 15:45.440
When was the last time
you saw your son?

15:45.508 --> 15:47.709
Yesterday morning.

15:47.777 --> 15:51.113
He was...
he was very excited...

15:51.180 --> 15:54.983
He said, man gave him
a $1,000 job.

15:55.051 --> 15:56.885
What man? Did he
give you a name?

15:56.936 --> 15:58.086
No.

15:58.154 --> 15:59.488
He said

15:59.555 --> 16:02.324
that man said,
you make delivery. That's all.

16:03.292 --> 16:04.092
He good man. He...

16:04.160 --> 16:05.827
He take good care

16:05.895 --> 16:07.513
for Ming-húa.

16:07.534 --> 16:10.469
If he was was a good man, why
was he running from the police?

16:18.417 --> 16:21.419
(speaking Mandarin)

16:22.455 --> 16:24.456
(speaking Mandarin)

16:26.856 --> 16:27.991
What's going on?

16:28.004 --> 16:30.005
They're here
illegally.

16:32.542 --> 16:35.527
Seven years ago,
we come here

16:35.611 --> 16:39.664
to find new home,
to find new life.

16:39.749 --> 16:42.918
Han work very hard
for his family.

16:42.985 --> 16:46.221
He would never kill any person.

16:46.289 --> 16:50.208
If that's true,
we'll prove that.

17:00.617 --> 17:02.285
DANNY:
<i>So, I-I want to know something.</i>

17:02.287 --> 17:03.487
Tell me, what is it

17:03.555 --> 17:05.222
that makes you turn
into a softie?

17:05.290 --> 17:06.223
What is that supposed to mean?

17:06.290 --> 17:07.691
What? You just told this guy

17:07.759 --> 17:09.593
that you're gonna make sure
his son is proven innocent.

17:09.661 --> 17:11.461
And I'm just curious,
what happens when you are wrong?

17:11.512 --> 17:13.180
The last words out
of Han Chi's mouth

17:13.265 --> 17:14.932
were his son's name,
okay? Ming-húa.

17:14.983 --> 17:17.134
I mean,
does that sound like a person

17:17.202 --> 17:18.969
that goes around
cutting people's heads off?

17:19.037 --> 17:21.338
Son of Sam liked dogs.

17:21.406 --> 17:23.307
Norman Bates loved his mother.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.192
That's a movie, Danny.

17:25.277 --> 17:27.044
I can give you more
non-cinematic references

17:27.112 --> 17:28.579
if you like.
I'm just saying,

17:28.647 --> 17:30.180
I don't think Han's our guy.

17:30.248 --> 17:31.348
Oh, well, good.
Then it's a wrap.

17:31.416 --> 17:32.666
Hey, you know what I mean?

17:32.751 --> 17:34.668
Let's just go get a plate lunch
and call it a day.

17:34.753 --> 17:36.320
There's nothing
in Han Chi's autopsy

17:36.388 --> 17:37.988
that ties him to the murder.

17:38.039 --> 17:39.990
Okay? Which means
there's no hard evidence,

17:40.041 --> 17:41.491
which you like
to say, right?

17:41.543 --> 17:43.210
Danny, as far
as we know,

17:43.295 --> 17:45.045
Han Chi never even
met the victim.

17:45.130 --> 17:47.831
The guy's driving around
with a head in his car, Steven.

17:47.899 --> 17:50.067
Okay? Just a head.
A <i>grande cabeza.</i>

17:50.135 --> 17:52.853
The cops go to pull him over,
and he runs.

17:52.937 --> 17:54.772
Yeah, the guy's
in the country illegally, Danny.

17:54.839 --> 17:56.190
He's gonna get deported
if he stops.

17:56.274 --> 17:57.641
I mean, he's
got a kid here.

17:57.692 --> 17:59.026
What are you talking about?
See? Stop.

17:59.110 --> 18:01.211
You're done because now I see
what's going on.

18:01.279 --> 18:02.696
Why is it that every time

18:02.781 --> 18:04.865
somebody's father is involved,
you get all goofy? Yeah...

18:04.949 --> 18:06.850
I'm not getting goofy. It's got
nothing to do with my father.

18:06.918 --> 18:08.619
I'm telling you,
every time we get

18:08.686 --> 18:10.621
in a situation like this,
you lose all objectivity.

18:10.689 --> 18:13.073
It's got nothing to do...
It's call transference, my friend.

18:13.158 --> 18:14.524
Oh, okay. Now I didn't know

18:14.576 --> 18:17.027
I was traveling in a car
with Dr. Sigmund Freud.

18:17.078 --> 18:18.746
♪ You don't have to save
everybody. ♪ You don't.

18:18.830 --> 18:20.364
That's all. Okay.
You done?

18:20.432 --> 18:21.799
If you've learned something.

18:21.866 --> 18:24.835
I'll take a "yes" there
if it'll shut you up.

18:27.172 --> 18:31.375
Somebody offered Han $1,000
to deliver a package.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.711
He took the job and
delivered the package

18:33.778 --> 18:36.397
so he could put food on
the table and feed his family.

18:36.481 --> 18:38.716
But he was just the
messenger, Danny.

18:38.783 --> 18:41.718
The guy who hired Han
to deliver the package--

18:41.770 --> 18:44.021
that's the killer. That's
the person we're looking for.

18:47.992 --> 18:49.960
Got tox results
back on our severed head.

18:50.028 --> 18:52.562
Lab found elevated levels
of lead in his blood.

18:52.614 --> 18:54.665
Which could mean our official
C.O.D. is a gunshot wound.

18:54.732 --> 18:55.833
Exactly.

18:55.900 --> 18:57.835
Also found traces
of iodine-131.

18:57.902 --> 18:59.319
Iodine?

18:59.387 --> 19:00.954
Yeah, it's radioactive.

19:01.039 --> 19:03.440
Our John Doe was being treated
for thyroid cancer.

19:03.508 --> 19:04.608
Based on these levels,

19:04.676 --> 19:06.243
most likely dosed
within the week.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.462
All right.
So, what's our next move?

19:08.546 --> 19:10.047
I don't know.

19:10.098 --> 19:11.799
What would you do, rook?

19:11.883 --> 19:13.517
Hmm.

19:13.585 --> 19:16.320
Uh, I'd start canvassing
our local hospitals

19:16.388 --> 19:17.921
and oncology wards.

19:17.972 --> 19:19.590
See if anyone
recognizes our vic.

19:19.657 --> 19:20.991
Okay.

19:21.059 --> 19:23.193
Um... oh, you know,
Hawaii Medical Center West

19:23.261 --> 19:25.929
has the best oncology
ward on the island.

19:25.997 --> 19:27.765
Yeah, they do, don't they?

19:27.832 --> 19:29.366
Hey, look,
I can, uh...

19:29.434 --> 19:31.301
I can handle
it if you want.

19:31.369 --> 19:32.903
I mean, if you're
not comfortable.

19:32.954 --> 19:34.204
No, no. I'll go with.

19:34.272 --> 19:35.155
You sure?

19:35.240 --> 19:37.241
Yeah. I'll be fine, kid.

19:39.077 --> 19:40.878
(sighs)

19:43.548 --> 19:44.998
Hey.

19:45.083 --> 19:46.467
Any luck?

19:46.551 --> 19:48.001
Oh, waiting
for the hospital administrator.

19:48.086 --> 19:49.586
The nurses won't release
any information

19:49.654 --> 19:50.921
without approval or a warrant.

19:50.989 --> 19:52.322
Patient confidentiality and all.
Right.

19:52.390 --> 19:53.957
Did you touch base
with McGarrett?

19:54.025 --> 19:55.125
Yeah. He thinks the driver

19:55.193 --> 19:56.593
was just the messenger,
not the killer.

19:56.661 --> 19:57.928
Other than that,
they got nothing.

19:59.631 --> 20:01.465
You having second thoughts
about coming?

20:01.533 --> 20:03.400
I told you I'm fine.

20:03.468 --> 20:05.152
Really? 'Cause that's
the third time you hit

20:05.236 --> 20:06.353
the elevator button.

20:06.438 --> 20:07.538
(sighs)

20:07.605 --> 20:09.139
Second.

20:09.207 --> 20:10.441
How's this?

20:10.508 --> 20:12.276
I'll go wait
at the nurses' station.

20:12.343 --> 20:13.911
I'll meet you at the lobby.

20:13.978 --> 20:15.279
Hey, I'm a cop, remember?

20:15.330 --> 20:17.648
Sometimes you got
to go places and see people

20:17.715 --> 20:19.082
you're not necessarily
comfortable with.

20:19.150 --> 20:20.651
It's just part of the job.

20:20.718 --> 20:22.652
Okay. Whatever you say, cuz.

20:22.704 --> 20:24.838
I'll go see
what's taking so long.

20:24.923 --> 20:26.006
Be right back.

20:27.058 --> 20:29.176
(elevator bell dings)

20:32.663 --> 20:33.931
Chin.

20:33.998 --> 20:36.233
Malia.

20:36.301 --> 20:40.204
Uh... it's great to see you.

20:40.271 --> 20:42.239
Um, yeah.

20:42.307 --> 20:44.241
Great to see you, too.

20:44.309 --> 20:46.410
Uh, so, what-what
are you doing here?

20:46.478 --> 20:49.446
Um, Kono and I are working
on a John Doe case.

20:49.514 --> 20:51.448
Whoa. Kono's here.
I'd-I'd love to see her.

20:51.516 --> 20:55.853
Oh, yeah, well, I'm sure
she'd love to see you, too.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.254
Uh, look, I...
Look, I...

20:57.322 --> 20:58.355
(both laugh)

20:58.406 --> 21:00.357
Ah, you-you first.

21:00.408 --> 21:02.226
Well, I just...

21:02.293 --> 21:04.194
(sighs)

21:04.262 --> 21:07.915
I think this is the first time
we've seen each other since...

21:07.999 --> 21:09.933
It is.

21:10.001 --> 21:12.002
You look amazing.

21:12.070 --> 21:14.972
Thank you.

21:17.675 --> 21:20.277
You're wearing it.

21:23.648 --> 21:25.849
Well, you told me
to keep it, so...

21:25.917 --> 21:27.885
I did.

21:29.887 --> 21:32.189
Listen, I hope you know
that everything I did

21:32.257 --> 21:33.407
was to protect you.

21:33.491 --> 21:35.776
I didn't want
your protection, Chin. I...

21:42.100 --> 21:44.968
When it ended between us...

21:45.036 --> 21:47.304
everyone thought I was the one

21:47.372 --> 21:48.956
that left you.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.340
(sighs)

21:50.408 --> 21:52.009
That really hurt.

21:52.076 --> 21:54.011
Yeah.

21:54.078 --> 21:56.179
I'm sorry.

21:58.916 --> 22:00.801
Hey, Malia.

22:00.885 --> 22:01.969
Kono.

22:02.053 --> 22:03.720
How are you?

22:03.771 --> 22:04.855
Great.

22:08.359 --> 22:11.562
So, uh, what are
you doing here?

22:11.629 --> 22:14.298
Well, actually, um,
maybe you can help us.

22:14.365 --> 22:16.466
We're trying to identify
a homicide victim,

22:16.534 --> 22:18.302
might have been a
cancer patient here.

22:18.369 --> 22:20.337
Oh, my God.

22:20.405 --> 22:22.439
That's Henry.

22:24.642 --> 22:25.742
Chin?

22:25.793 --> 22:27.160
CHIN:
His name was Henry Duncan.

22:27.245 --> 22:29.913
35 years old. He was a high
school physics teacher.

22:29.981 --> 22:33.150
Emergency contact listed n
his file was his wife Nicole.

22:33.217 --> 22:34.685
Kono put in a
call to the house,

22:34.752 --> 22:36.053
but all she got
was a busy signal.

22:36.120 --> 22:37.671
Nobody has
a busy signal anymore.

22:37.755 --> 22:39.056
It means something's wrong.

22:39.123 --> 22:40.490
Chin, get us the address.
We're on the way.

22:40.558 --> 22:41.391
Ill text it.

23:22.600 --> 23:24.901
Nicole?

23:24.969 --> 23:26.970
Nicole Duncan?

23:35.480 --> 23:36.730
Clear in here.

23:45.189 --> 23:48.358
Nicole's gone, but come
check this out.

23:48.409 --> 23:51.378
We got, uh, blood splatter
on the walls.

23:53.798 --> 23:56.800
And a broken heel.

23:56.867 --> 23:58.969
(grunts)

23:59.036 --> 24:00.887
Probably came off
in a struggle.

24:02.373 --> 24:05.592
Blood's high velocity,
consistent of a gunshot wound.

24:05.677 --> 24:07.594
This could be where
Henry Duncan was murdered.

24:08.294 --> 24:10.261
(sighs)
Or his wife.

24:10.649 --> 24:11.782
Yeah.

24:20.265 --> 24:21.417
Okay.

24:21.511 --> 24:23.095
All right. Thank you.

24:23.179 --> 24:26.882
Okay, uh, according to her boss,

24:26.933 --> 24:29.602
Nicole Duncan did not
show up for work today.

24:29.686 --> 24:31.386
I got alerts out.

24:31.438 --> 24:33.388
We got her credit cards,
cash, cell phone.

24:33.440 --> 24:36.425
All right, all signs
are pointing to Nicole

24:36.493 --> 24:37.826
joining her husband
in the victim category.

24:37.894 --> 24:39.728
(disconnection tone beeps)

24:39.779 --> 24:41.664
All right.
If we can't find her,

24:41.731 --> 24:44.199
at least we can find out
who they spoke to last.

24:49.506 --> 24:51.941
(dialing)

24:52.008 --> 24:53.842
(WOMAN'S VOICE)
You've reached Hawaiian Airlines

24:53.910 --> 24:55.010
flight information.

24:55.078 --> 24:56.211
Airline computer.

24:56.279 --> 24:58.747
Okay, hang on.
Uh, what is it... star 69.

24:58.798 --> 25:03.052
Dial star 69 and see about
the last incoming call.

25:03.103 --> 25:04.053
MAN:
Hello?

25:04.104 --> 25:05.471
Hey, Jimmy?

25:05.555 --> 25:07.473
I think you have
the wrong number.

25:07.557 --> 25:09.191
Who's this?

25:09.259 --> 25:11.260
Robert Rovin. Who's this?

25:11.328 --> 25:12.728
Oh, wrong
number. Sorry.

25:12.796 --> 25:15.531
Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.

25:15.598 --> 25:16.782
What you got?

25:16.866 --> 25:18.801
Robert Rovin.

25:18.868 --> 25:21.437
I knew that name
sounded familiar. Robert Rovin.

25:21.504 --> 25:23.472
He's one of the guys
on Chin's list.

25:23.540 --> 25:25.274
GPS destination.

25:25.342 --> 25:27.159
Okay, he's got
an investment firm

25:27.243 --> 25:28.777
on the tenth floor of
that building on Keawe Street.

25:28.828 --> 25:30.379
Where Han Chi was going.

25:30.447 --> 25:32.014
Yeah, with Duncan's head.

25:37.320 --> 25:39.555
DANNY:
<i>Are you sure?</i>

25:39.622 --> 25:40.556
Okay, yeah.
We're on our way now.

25:40.623 --> 25:42.558
What is it?

25:42.625 --> 25:44.793
Chin ran background
on Robert Rovin.

25:44.844 --> 25:48.514
Okay, and it turns out that he's
related to our head in the box.

25:48.598 --> 25:50.299
He's Henry Duncan's
father-in-law.

25:50.367 --> 25:51.617
Nicole's father?

25:51.685 --> 25:53.352
Yeah. Since he never filed
a missing persons report,

25:53.436 --> 25:55.487
that means one of two things--
either he knows

25:55.572 --> 25:57.323
what's going on,

25:57.407 --> 25:59.541
or we are on our way
to make a death notification.

26:01.528 --> 26:03.912
Henry was murdered?
Do you know who did it?

26:03.980 --> 26:05.981
That's what we're working on
right now.

26:06.049 --> 26:08.083
My daughter?
What about, uh, Nicole?

26:08.151 --> 26:09.618
I'm afraid she's missing.

26:09.686 --> 26:11.987
What? Missing?
What do you mean, she's missing?

26:12.055 --> 26:14.373
We haven't found her yet,
but I have my task force

26:14.457 --> 26:15.958
and every available police
officer looking for her.

26:16.026 --> 26:18.493
(sighs)

26:18.545 --> 26:20.679
Ah...

26:20.764 --> 26:23.465
(sighs)

26:26.353 --> 26:29.855
Look, um, we know
this is difficult for you.

26:29.939 --> 26:31.506
Please, if you can,

26:31.558 --> 26:34.009
you just tell us when's the last
time you spoke to your daughter?

26:34.077 --> 26:36.478
I-I, um...

26:36.529 --> 26:38.113
I called her a few days ago.

26:38.181 --> 26:40.315
Okay, um,

26:40.367 --> 26:42.785
by any chance, did she mention
a trip that she was planning?

26:42.852 --> 26:44.370
No, no. That's impossible.

26:44.454 --> 26:47.623
Henry was sick.
He... he was fighting cancer.

26:47.690 --> 26:49.258
He spent most of his time
at the hospital.

26:49.325 --> 26:50.993
Could she have gone
someplace by herself?

26:51.061 --> 26:54.830
No. She wouldn't have left him
alone, uh, during chemo.

26:54.898 --> 26:56.665
When was the last time
you spoke to Henry?

26:56.733 --> 26:59.001
Monday. We-We, uh...

27:00.703 --> 27:02.805
We met for dinner.

27:04.874 --> 27:06.809
Anything strange
about that night?

27:06.876 --> 27:08.277
Other than the fact
that his disease

27:08.344 --> 27:09.711
was sucking the life
out of him, no.

27:09.779 --> 27:11.814
Oh...

27:14.617 --> 27:16.885
I can't lose my little girl.

27:19.222 --> 27:21.156
She's all I have left.

27:23.726 --> 27:25.561
We're going to get
to the bottom of this.

27:25.628 --> 27:28.464
Do either of you
have any children?

27:28.531 --> 27:30.332
Yeah, I do. I have a daughter.

27:30.400 --> 27:33.769
Then you'll understand
the lengths you'll go to

27:33.837 --> 27:37.005
as a parent
to protect your children.

27:38.541 --> 27:40.642
(phone ringing)

27:40.710 --> 27:43.378
Gentlemen, I've been
expecting this call,

27:43.446 --> 27:45.547
so please,
if you'll excuse me....

27:45.615 --> 27:47.082
Um, listen, we're
going to let you know

27:47.133 --> 27:48.383
as soon as we hear something.
Thank you.

27:48.451 --> 27:51.019
Really quickly, I have one
quick question for you.

27:51.087 --> 27:52.688
You ever seen this man before?

27:52.755 --> 27:54.256
No, I haven't.

27:54.324 --> 27:55.324
Why?

27:55.391 --> 27:56.425
We have reason
to believe that he was

27:56.493 --> 27:57.826
on his way here
last night.

27:57.894 --> 27:58.994
Well, if he was,

27:59.062 --> 28:00.162
I had no idea, so...

28:00.230 --> 28:01.647
(ringing continues)
Please.

28:01.731 --> 28:03.999
Uh, excuse me.

28:04.067 --> 28:06.068
Yeah, of course.

28:07.403 --> 28:10.038
That was interesting.

28:10.106 --> 28:11.773
You see how panicked he got
when he got that phone call?

28:11.825 --> 28:13.342
See how he was talking
about his daughter?

28:13.409 --> 28:15.127
Yeah. "The lengths you would
go to protect your children."

28:15.211 --> 28:16.662
Tell you what,
that cat knows something.

28:16.746 --> 28:18.113
He just did a bad job
of hiding it.

28:18.181 --> 28:20.048
I'm going to call Kono.

28:20.116 --> 28:21.834
We'll sit on Rovin,
see what he's up to.

28:21.918 --> 28:23.469
All right.

28:23.553 --> 28:25.304
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

28:28.842 --> 28:30.392
How fast can she get here?

28:59.022 --> 29:01.540
♪ ♪

29:01.624 --> 29:03.509
Whoa, whoa. Not
so close, Wilcox.

29:03.593 --> 29:05.594
Don't tell me how
to tail a suspect.

29:05.661 --> 29:07.679
And if this was <i>CHiPs,</i>
I'd be Estrada.

29:07.764 --> 29:08.864
You'd be Wilcox.

29:08.932 --> 29:10.098
I don't think so.

29:39.262 --> 29:40.829
What's he up to?

29:54.244 --> 29:55.978
Looks like he's got company.

30:01.017 --> 30:04.853
(talking indistinctly)

30:04.921 --> 30:07.322
It's a money drop.

30:09.058 --> 30:10.442
Gun! Gun! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

30:10.526 --> 30:13.328
Hold on!
(tires squeal)

30:22.789 --> 30:25.207
(tires squeal)

30:34.584 --> 30:36.718
Where'd he go?

30:48.164 --> 30:49.698
Danny!

30:59.792 --> 31:01.159
Spenser Owens.

31:01.244 --> 31:03.611
(panting)

31:03.663 --> 31:05.213
He rented the Mustang
that Chi was driving.

31:05.281 --> 31:07.215
Hey, hey.
Listen to me. Hey.

31:07.283 --> 31:09.851
Where's Nicole? You need
to tell us where Nicole is.

31:09.919 --> 31:11.503
Huh? Can you hear me?
Listen to me!

31:11.587 --> 31:12.554
Where's Nicole?

31:12.622 --> 31:14.222
He can't die.

31:14.290 --> 31:17.559
If anything goes wrong,
they'll kill my daughter. I...

31:27.637 --> 31:29.258
I just sent Owens' gun
off to ballistics

31:29.305 --> 31:30.438
in case we find Duncan's body.

31:30.506 --> 31:32.140
Hopefully,
we can match it up to a slug.

31:32.191 --> 31:34.008
All right, I want deep
background on Owens--

31:34.060 --> 31:35.944
all known associates,
addresses, the whole bit.

31:36.011 --> 31:37.312
So you've never
seen this guy before?

31:37.363 --> 31:38.480
No, I never saw him before.

31:38.547 --> 31:39.614
The only contact
I had with this guy

31:39.682 --> 31:41.816
was over the phone.

31:41.867 --> 31:43.184
He said he and his
associates had Nicole.

31:43.235 --> 31:44.652
He said, uh, Henry tried

31:44.720 --> 31:47.322
to escape, so they killed him,
but Nicole is was still alive,

31:47.373 --> 31:48.556
and if I ever wanted
to see her again,

31:48.624 --> 31:49.791
I had to give
him $5 million.

31:49.859 --> 31:51.459
Okay. So you never thought
to call the police?

31:51.527 --> 31:54.162
He told me he'd kill her
if I told anyone,

31:54.213 --> 31:56.081
so he told me to
prove he was serious,

31:56.165 --> 31:57.599
he was going
to send me a package.

31:57.666 --> 31:58.833
But I never got anything.

32:03.839 --> 32:05.256
I had him.

32:05.341 --> 32:06.808
I had him
and I let him go.

32:06.876 --> 32:09.811
He wasn't even a suspect.
You did your job.

32:09.878 --> 32:11.479
Hey.

32:11.547 --> 32:13.014
Don't.

32:13.065 --> 32:14.516
Hey.

32:14.583 --> 32:17.619
You're not psychic.
You can't read people's minds.

32:17.686 --> 32:18.770
I should have known
he was lying.

32:18.854 --> 32:20.655
That comes with time
and experience, Kono.

32:20.722 --> 32:23.391
Look, we all
make mistakes.

32:23.459 --> 32:25.427
You got to learn
to live with that,

32:25.494 --> 32:27.162
because that's part of the job.

32:29.632 --> 32:32.267
(indistinct radio transmissions)

32:34.303 --> 32:36.388
She all right?

32:36.472 --> 32:37.889
She will be.

32:37.973 --> 32:39.340
DANNY:
Hey, guys, come here.

32:41.977 --> 32:43.645
(flies buzzing)

32:43.712 --> 32:46.314
What do you got?
What is it?

32:46.365 --> 32:47.615
Blowflies.

32:47.683 --> 32:49.851
Usually find them
around dead bodies.

32:49.919 --> 32:51.703
Nicole?

32:51.787 --> 32:53.688
Here we go.

32:58.711 --> 33:00.095
Looks like we found
the rest of Henry Duncan.

33:00.162 --> 33:02.997
All right, uh, male.
Gunshot wound to the chest.

33:03.048 --> 33:04.198
DANNY:
No, no, no.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.800
He doesn't need...
No!

33:05.868 --> 33:07.702
Hey, hey, hey.
You got to find my daughter!

33:07.753 --> 33:09.471
You've got to find her!
Get him out of here.

33:09.538 --> 33:11.172
(sobs):
My daughter. God.

33:11.223 --> 33:12.807
Listen to me.
Listen to me now.

33:12.875 --> 33:15.310
When Spenser does not return
with that money, all right,

33:15.377 --> 33:17.044
whoever he's working with is going
to know that this went bad...

33:17.096 --> 33:19.180
and then Nicole's dead.

33:40.920 --> 33:42.904
Nicole?

33:45.875 --> 33:48.343
Nicole Duncan.
Clear.

33:48.410 --> 33:50.245
Clear.
Clear.

34:05.694 --> 34:07.695
(sighs)

34:15.670 --> 34:17.338
She's not here.

34:17.406 --> 34:19.407
He must have stashed her
someplace else.

34:23.110 --> 34:24.445
Call HPD, tell them

34:24.496 --> 34:26.681
Nicole might be being held
at a secondary location.

34:26.748 --> 34:29.617
And get that saw over
to the crime lab, okay?

34:29.685 --> 34:30.952
I want to make sure that blood
doesn't belong to Nicole.

34:31.003 --> 34:33.554
Looks like our boy
was taking a trip.

34:33.621 --> 34:35.289
Pretty sure he was
planning a vacation

34:35.341 --> 34:36.925
once he got that
ransom money.

34:36.976 --> 34:39.092
Hey, Chin, listen, find out

34:39.143 --> 34:42.597
if Spenser Owens purchased any
overseas airline trips recently.

34:42.665 --> 34:44.431
Hey, tell him
to call Hawaiian Airlines.

34:44.483 --> 34:46.301
Uh, cross-reference
any itineraries

34:46.368 --> 34:47.402
of female passengers

34:47.469 --> 34:48.436
or traveling companions.

34:48.487 --> 34:49.103
You get that?

34:49.154 --> 34:51.155
I'm on it.

34:52.841 --> 34:54.775
(computer trilling)

34:54.827 --> 34:56.610
What are you thinking?

34:56.661 --> 34:59.781
I am thinking that Nicole
is definitely involved, right?

34:59.832 --> 35:02.217
But I don't think she's
traveling under her own name.

35:02.284 --> 35:04.419
I think she's a little too smart
for that.

35:04.486 --> 35:06.371
Smart enough
to stage her own kidnapping?

35:06.455 --> 35:08.456
Yeah, I think so.
A little help from Spenser.

35:08.524 --> 35:10.058
Right? I mean,
let's think about it.

35:10.125 --> 35:12.627
The guy has never committed
a crime in his entire life.

35:12.695 --> 35:13.761
And this--
this beautiful place--

35:13.829 --> 35:15.330
is this where
you'd bring a hostage?

35:15.397 --> 35:16.698
That's pretty slim.
No.

35:16.765 --> 35:18.099
I'll tell you
what's not slim.

35:18.167 --> 35:20.468
What's not slim is
that he's got his bags packed.

35:20.536 --> 35:23.838
She made a call from her house
to Hawaiian Airlines, and

35:23.889 --> 35:25.506
we have champagne.

35:25.574 --> 35:27.091
Champagne?

35:27.176 --> 35:28.309
Yeah.

35:28.377 --> 35:29.978
Champagne with bubbles.

35:30.045 --> 35:31.596
Poured recently.
Look at you.

35:31.680 --> 35:33.598
Why was he drinking champagne

35:33.682 --> 35:35.516
if he hasn't gotten
the money yet?

35:35.568 --> 35:38.719
(phone ringing)

35:38.771 --> 35:41.322
I wonder what shade
Nicole wears.

35:41.390 --> 35:42.357
Chin, go ahead.

35:42.424 --> 35:43.791
Yeah, you were right.

35:43.859 --> 35:45.827
Looks like Spenser purchased two
first class tickets to Paris.

35:45.894 --> 35:48.863
Paris, France. France has no
extradition treaty with the U.S.

35:48.914 --> 35:50.398
Yeah. He's traveling
with a female companion

35:50.449 --> 35:51.733
by the name of Erin Barrett,

35:51.800 --> 35:53.501
but I can't find
any information on her.

35:53.569 --> 35:55.003
Oh, you won't.
It's an alias.

35:55.070 --> 35:56.671
How'd you get to be so smart?

36:01.410 --> 36:04.128
(MAN over P.A.)
This is the final boarding call

36:04.213 --> 36:05.913
for Flight 1182
bound for Paris.

36:05.981 --> 36:07.782
Spenser, where are you?

36:07.850 --> 36:09.467
I've been leaving messages.

36:09.551 --> 36:11.185
Baby, I'm worried.

36:11.253 --> 36:13.254
The plane's about to leave.

36:14.657 --> 36:18.259
This is the final boarding call
for Flight 1182 bound for Paris.

36:18.327 --> 36:20.395
(sighs)

36:26.402 --> 36:28.936
STEVE: You know, if statistics
are anything to go by,

36:28.988 --> 36:32.106
flying's actually the safest
mode of transportation.

36:32.157 --> 36:33.274
Excuse me?

36:33.342 --> 36:35.109
Well, you seem nervous,
that's all.

36:35.160 --> 36:36.878
I'm waiting for somebody.

36:36.945 --> 36:38.913
- Oh.
- I don't want to miss my plane.

36:40.115 --> 36:43.484
The thing is, uh... Nicole,

36:43.552 --> 36:47.555
that, uh,
we-we know everything.

36:47.623 --> 36:50.258
Or should I say Erin?

36:51.293 --> 36:53.361
(sighs)

36:53.429 --> 36:56.798
Oh, um, I don't think
Spenser's going to make it.

36:56.865 --> 36:58.983
Actually, I'm positive
he's not gonna make it.

36:59.068 --> 37:02.170
The slug we pulled out of
your husband's body was a match

37:02.237 --> 37:05.306
to the gun that Spenser had
on him, and the thing is,

37:05.374 --> 37:07.775
it wasn't just Spenser's prints
that we found on the gun.

37:07.826 --> 37:10.812
Yours were there, too, Nicole.

37:10.879 --> 37:13.181
DANNY: I'm just curious
about one thing.

37:13.248 --> 37:14.982
Um, how long...

37:15.050 --> 37:17.585
Uh, how long were you
having an affair with Spenser

37:17.653 --> 37:20.288
before you decided
to kill your husband?

37:20.356 --> 37:23.424
And why did you, uh... why did
you fake your own kidnapping?

37:23.492 --> 37:25.660
I mean, your husband
was already dying of cancer.

37:25.728 --> 37:28.196
I couldn't get five million

37:28.263 --> 37:30.631
out of my father
if he died that way.

37:30.699 --> 37:32.166
(sighs)

37:32.217 --> 37:34.168
Wow!

37:34.236 --> 37:37.271
That's... that's cold.

37:37.339 --> 37:39.307
So what about Han Chi?
Where does he fit

37:39.375 --> 37:41.008
in all of this?
Who?

37:41.076 --> 37:42.777
Who? What, are you an owl?

37:42.844 --> 37:44.912
Han Chi. He's the
guy that you paid

37:44.980 --> 37:47.982
to bring the head of your
ex-husband to your father.

37:48.050 --> 37:49.817
I don't know.
Just some day laborer

37:49.885 --> 37:51.986
Spenser hired
who used to cut his lawn.

37:52.054 --> 37:55.039
You just figured you'd, uh...
you'd use him again.

37:55.124 --> 37:57.358
Spenser wanted somebody
who didn't ask any questions.

37:57.426 --> 37:59.060
And this guy needed the work.

37:59.128 --> 38:00.661
Spenser rented him a car,

38:00.713 --> 38:03.064
plugged the address
into the GPS.

38:03.132 --> 38:05.466
All he had to do
was drop off the box.

38:05.534 --> 38:08.252
Right, when he didn't,
Spenser reported the car stolen,

38:08.337 --> 38:10.004
and then you figured

38:10.072 --> 38:12.240
that we'd think
that Han was the killer.

38:12.307 --> 38:15.076
If that guy hadn't messed up,
we'd be in Paris right now,

38:15.144 --> 38:17.412
and he'd have some money
in his pocket.

38:17.479 --> 38:20.581
He'd also be
an accomplice to a murder.

38:21.934 --> 38:24.419
But Han Chi is dead now
because of you.

38:24.486 --> 38:26.888
And you know what else?

38:26.955 --> 38:30.057
A little boy lost a father today

38:30.125 --> 38:32.627
because you wanted
to take the easy way out.

38:36.949 --> 38:38.633
(sighs)

38:38.700 --> 38:40.635
I really, really hope

38:40.702 --> 38:42.736
that you spend the rest
of your life

38:42.788 --> 38:45.540
rotting in a jail cell
thinking about that.

38:48.977 --> 38:50.912
Are you done?

38:51.947 --> 38:54.482
Am I done?

38:54.550 --> 38:56.417
Yeah.

38:56.485 --> 38:57.852
Yeah, I'm done.

38:57.920 --> 38:59.854
Hey, Danny?

38:59.922 --> 39:01.222
Yeah.

39:01.290 --> 39:03.591
You need to get this woman
away from me.

39:17.489 --> 39:19.040
(mutters)

39:19.107 --> 39:20.708
You coming?

39:20.776 --> 39:22.126
No. You go.

39:22.211 --> 39:23.377
I'll catch up.

39:23.445 --> 39:24.612
Okay.

39:46.201 --> 39:48.135
Please.

39:53.041 --> 39:56.677
I'm glad we could prove
that Han Chi was innocent.

39:56.745 --> 39:58.746
Thank you.

39:59.748 --> 40:01.682
For everything

40:01.750 --> 40:04.285
you have done for my son.

40:11.059 --> 40:13.060
There's one last thing.

40:17.165 --> 40:19.100
What is it?

40:19.167 --> 40:21.669
It's a letter

40:21.720 --> 40:23.871
signed by the
governor of Hawaii.

40:23.939 --> 40:25.806
It states

40:25.874 --> 40:29.010
that she's personally expediting
your citizenship papers.

40:30.279 --> 40:31.979
You're gonna be
a U.S. citizen.

40:32.030 --> 40:34.315
You and your family.

40:47.896 --> 40:49.897
(crying)

40:55.571 --> 40:58.806
I... I have something for you.

40:58.874 --> 41:00.708
(grunts)

41:00.776 --> 41:02.143
What is this?

41:02.210 --> 41:03.678
Open.

41:07.382 --> 41:08.733
Master cylinder,

41:08.817 --> 41:13.321
'74 Mercury Marquis.

41:15.056 --> 41:18.859
You need help putting in,
you call me.

41:18.927 --> 41:20.895
Please.

41:20.963 --> 41:22.396
<i>Xie xie.</i>

41:22.464 --> 41:24.398
No.

41:24.449 --> 41:26.801
Thank you.

41:29.371 --> 41:31.372
(speaking Mandarin)

41:45.187 --> 41:47.121
(horns honking on video)

41:47.189 --> 41:49.624
DANNY:
Estrada was a bad bitch, man.

41:49.691 --> 41:52.443
Yup. That's why there's no way.

41:52.527 --> 41:53.811
Wait a minute.

41:53.895 --> 41:55.279
Why can't I be Estrada?

41:55.364 --> 41:59.784
In a world where I didn't exist,
you could be whatever you want.

41:59.868 --> 42:00.968
That world sounds lovely.

42:01.036 --> 42:02.136
It's logistics,
anyway, Danny.

42:02.204 --> 42:03.904
You know, I mean,
Estrada's got dark hair.

42:03.956 --> 42:06.073
Wilcox is the blonde.

42:06.141 --> 42:07.308
I know.

42:07.376 --> 42:09.243
I know,
but ladies loved Estrada.

42:09.311 --> 42:10.911
Case in point, bub.

42:10.963 --> 42:12.129
Please. Please stop.

42:12.214 --> 42:13.748
You're making a fool
of yourself.

42:13.799 --> 42:15.016
Okay? Just stop.
I'm just saying.

42:15.083 --> 42:16.684
No. Just listen to
what I'm saying, man.

42:16.752 --> 42:18.586
I have more in common
with Estrada. It's just...

42:18.654 --> 42:21.088
Like what? What do you have
in common? Like a nickname?

42:21.156 --> 42:23.057
'Cause I didn't know
you had a nickname.

42:23.125 --> 42:25.259
I have a nickname,
and so did Ponch.

42:25.327 --> 42:26.427
That's ridiculous.
Just 'cause

42:26.495 --> 42:28.429
I call you Danno
doesn't make you Ponch.

42:30.032 --> 42:32.233
Can we just both be Estrada?

42:32.300 --> 42:34.235
(sighs)
That's fine.

42:34.302 --> 42:35.936
What are you
guys watching?

42:36.004 --> 42:37.104
<i>CHiPs</i> marathon.

42:37.172 --> 42:38.823
I never heard of it.

42:38.907 --> 42:41.242
I used to watch this show
as a kid.

42:41.309 --> 42:42.910
Got me interested
in riding bikes.

42:42.978 --> 42:44.478
Ooh, that guy's
pretty hot.

42:44.546 --> 42:46.280
STEVE:
The dark one, right?

42:46.348 --> 42:47.815
No. The blonde.

42:47.883 --> 42:49.383
Oh, that's me.
