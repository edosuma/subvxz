00:49.883 --> 00:53.803
Some people can see
all your mistakes.

00:53.929 --> 00:56.597
The way you hold it
in your shoulders.

00:56.724 --> 01:01.018
Show it in your face.

01:01.019 --> 01:03.813
I made a lot of mistakes
in my life

01:03.939 --> 01:08.025
and they were
my mistakes.

01:08.026 --> 01:10.695
Nobody else's.

01:10.821 --> 01:13.072
Mine.

01:13.198 --> 01:15.283
When you get older,
all those mistakes

01:15.409 --> 01:18.703
start piling up inside you.

01:18.829 --> 01:22.165
Regrets, blame.

01:24.042 --> 01:26.210
It's enough to make you
sick to your stomach.

01:29.131 --> 01:32.717
Problem is,
there are certain things

01:32.843 --> 01:34.927
that I just can't
change about myself.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.283
Fill it up, will you?

02:03.957 --> 02:06.626
- Morning.
- Good morning.

02:06.752 --> 02:08.085
$20 on eight, please?

02:12.299 --> 02:14.008
Where are your cards?

02:14.092 --> 02:17.428
Cards... Backside of
this aisle right here.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.236
He almost finished
out there?

02:33.362 --> 02:34.946
Yeah, almost.

02:43.413 --> 02:47.041
9-1-1. What's your emergency?

02:47.125 --> 02:50.378
Hello? What's the address
of your emergency?

02:54.132 --> 02:55.675
That'll be it.

02:55.801 --> 02:59.136
Okay, $20 on
the pump, $24.

02:59.221 --> 03:01.305
$24. That's a steal.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.521
You have a good day.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.738
Boy.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.164
You're the one
from the paper.

03:27.165 --> 03:30.918
I think you got me confused
with somebody else, all right?

03:31.044 --> 03:33.880
No. I know who you are.

03:34.006 --> 03:36.173
I know who he is too.

03:51.565 --> 03:55.192
The truth, sir...

05:00.092 --> 05:02.259
I assume you're a friend.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.594
I'm sorry.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.514
A friend of
the family?

05:06.640 --> 05:07.515
Yeah.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.100
I'm sorry for your loss.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.771
What's gonna happen
with the boy?

05:13.897 --> 05:16.440
He's going to his
grandparents' place.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.192
Where were they?

05:18.276 --> 05:21.070
They live in
Farmington, New Mexico.

05:21.196 --> 05:23.280
But I hear his
grandfather's gravely ill.

05:23.365 --> 05:25.366
You driving him?

05:25.492 --> 05:28.869
Oh, no. I'm just gonna chauffer him
over to the bus station.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.287
Do you know Louis?

05:30.288 --> 05:31.831
No.

05:31.957 --> 05:34.375
Thank the Lord,
he's got his grandparents.

05:34.501 --> 05:35.960
Yeah.

05:38.547 --> 05:40.589
All right, son.
You ready?

05:40.716 --> 05:42.383
Yes, sir.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.719
Let me help you.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.516
Right over here.

06:00.569 --> 06:02.570
All right, son.

06:10.912 --> 06:13.622
So all right.
Here we go.

06:13.749 --> 06:14.999
Now I've got your ticket.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.417
Your money's
in the envelope.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.669
They're gonna put your skis
and bags underneath.

06:20.839 --> 06:24.133
I hate buses.

06:24.259 --> 06:25.593
Can't you
just drive me?

06:25.719 --> 06:28.637
Aw, son, I'm needed here.
But you'll be fine.

06:28.764 --> 06:30.556
Nothing to worry about, okay?

06:32.517 --> 06:35.311
It's uh...
It was nice meeting you.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.104
You too, Louis.

06:39.524 --> 06:42.109
I'll be praying
for you, son.

07:28.907 --> 07:32.785
Hey, Louis.
I'm John.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.495
Yeah, you were at the church.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.330
That's right, that's right.

07:36.414 --> 07:37.665
Nice to meet you.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.291
Listen, I'm sorry
about your mother.

07:39.417 --> 07:40.459
It's a shame.

07:42.420 --> 07:45.422
Listen, I just got a phone call
from your grandparents.

07:45.423 --> 07:46.966
Apparently, they don't
love the idea of you

07:47.092 --> 07:49.927
riding on this bus
for three days.

07:50.053 --> 07:51.345
They asked me if
I'd give you a lift.

07:51.429 --> 07:52.763
Meanwhile, I was headed
that way

07:52.889 --> 07:54.431
so I told them, shit, why not?

07:56.434 --> 07:58.602
Sir, I don't know you.

07:58.728 --> 08:01.730
Yeah, well, I don't really
know you either and,

08:01.857 --> 08:03.440
frankly, this is
a pain in my ass.

08:03.441 --> 08:06.110
But, like I said,
I know your grandparents

08:06.236 --> 08:09.446
and your mother was a...
She was a good woman.

08:09.531 --> 08:12.741
You knew my mom?

08:12.868 --> 08:14.326
Yeah.

08:14.452 --> 08:15.772
She never really
talked about you.

08:15.871 --> 08:16.745
Yeah?

08:16.872 --> 08:21.709
Well, I guess I didn't make much of
an impression then, did I?

08:21.835 --> 08:23.586
We kept in touch.
I'd call, she'd call.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.504
- You know how it goes.
- Yeah.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.381
Listen, I got to hit the road.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.383
I understand if you don't
want to come with me.

08:29.467 --> 08:31.010
Besides, buses ain't so bad.

08:31.136 --> 08:35.472
Perfectly civilized mode of
transportation, if you ask me.

08:35.472 --> 08:38.017
But, hey,

08:38.143 --> 08:41.520
good luck to you, kid,

08:41.645 --> 08:47.026
and my deepest condolences to
you and your family, all right?

08:50.947 --> 08:53.324
Kid, you getting
on the bus? I gotta go.

08:57.412 --> 08:58.495
Sir.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.164
Sir?

09:10.133 --> 09:12.676
Get in.

09:17.807 --> 09:22.228
You, uh... You live in
this car or something?

09:22.354 --> 09:23.520
No, of course not.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.564
I just wasn't
expecting guests.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.082
Your mother was
a wonderful woman.

09:43.208 --> 09:47.920
Classy lady, fun gal.
Full of spirit.

09:48.046 --> 09:48.921
She was...

09:49.047 --> 09:53.425
Sparky.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.095
- Oh...
- She was...

09:56.221 --> 09:57.596
I forgot.

09:59.557 --> 10:03.435
What do you got there?
Pictures.

10:03.561 --> 10:04.561
Ah.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.563
This is
my grandparents' house.

10:06.564 --> 10:11.568
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Good, that's good.

10:15.573 --> 10:19.576
You know, the only time I really visited
them was when I was little.

10:19.661 --> 10:22.288
Mom didn't get along with
my grandparents too well.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.581
Didn't really talk.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.251
Hey, how long do you
think it'll take?

10:27.377 --> 10:28.919
I don't know.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.175
What?

10:36.886 --> 10:38.595
Nothing.

10:40.598 --> 10:42.516
Hey, I got to make
a couple quick calls.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.727
Should just take me
a couple minutes.

10:56.614 --> 10:59.325
- Moody residence.
- Mrs. Moody?

10:59.451 --> 11:02.202
John Wheeler here.
How you doing?

11:02.329 --> 11:05.122
You have got some
nerve calling here.

11:05.248 --> 11:08.625
I was just at your daughter's
wake. Where were you?

11:08.626 --> 11:12.296
Earl's sick.
Now what do you want?

11:14.090 --> 11:16.133
I got Louis, her boy.

11:16.259 --> 11:18.510
What... why would
you have Louis?

11:18.636 --> 11:20.596
Now, look, there's been
a change of plans.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.639
I'm gonna drive him home.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.434
Where's that priest?
Put Louis on the phone.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.727
It'll just take
a couple of days.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.520
You got nothing
to worry about.

11:28.646 --> 11:32.649
Now you put Louis back on
that bus and get back...

11:41.576 --> 11:43.410
One more stop.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.651
Stay here.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.694
Hey, I need that
to get home!

12:22.992 --> 12:25.661
What's up, John?

12:26.621 --> 12:30.290
Will you excuse us
for a moment, please?

12:30.417 --> 12:31.708
Okay, thanks.

12:50.728 --> 12:52.729
This is a fucking joke,
right?

12:52.730 --> 12:55.274
There's a little over
6,000 bucks right there.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.902
You're short $14,000
and change. Maybe more.

12:59.028 --> 13:01.780
Well, what are you...
you said $10,000.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.449
I owe you $10,000.

13:03.575 --> 13:08.245
You're late, John, again.
So it's $20.

13:08.371 --> 13:12.875
What are you doing, huh?

13:13.001 --> 13:14.668
How long have
we known each other?

13:14.752 --> 13:17.296
Long enough for you
to know better.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.840
This is fucking bullshit, John!
Do you understand?

13:19.966 --> 13:23.760
What the fuck
do you want from me?

13:23.845 --> 13:25.762
John,

13:25.763 --> 13:29.766
protection in jail
is very expensive.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.435
Do you understand that?

13:31.561 --> 13:33.770
I didn't ask you for
any goddamned protection.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.939
Yeah, but you took it.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.609
You know jail could have
been dangerous for you, John.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.405
I'm living out of my car.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.951
I don't have
anything else.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.797
I just gave you everything
that I got, okay?

13:49.871 --> 13:53.123
Boy, do you want
to go back to jail?

13:53.249 --> 13:55.459
You like the bed and the three meals of
crap they serve you every day?

13:55.585 --> 13:58.378
'Cause I can arrange that with
just one fucking phone call.

13:58.505 --> 13:59.671
Freddy, give me
the fucking phone.

13:59.797 --> 14:00.797
No, no, no, no.

14:00.882 --> 14:02.362
You're not gonna
make any phone calls.

14:02.425 --> 14:04.801
I got just as much shit
on you as you got on me.

14:04.886 --> 14:07.763
6,000 bucks.
That's all you get.

14:45.260 --> 14:47.261
We're closed!

14:48.680 --> 14:50.222
We're closed!

14:54.686 --> 14:56.478
Goddamn kid.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.627
Hey, are you in
some kind of trouble?

15:23.881 --> 15:28.594
It's nothing.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.263
Did they
do that to you?

15:31.389 --> 15:33.140
I don't know
what I was thinking.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.891
You ain't worth the trouble.

15:48.197 --> 15:52.451
The closest I could
get you is Albuquerque.

15:52.577 --> 15:56.788
I'll call your grandma and have her
pick you up in a couple of days.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.665
Good to meet you.

17:20.580 --> 17:22.958
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

17:23.041 --> 17:24.792
Louis!

17:27.088 --> 17:28.630
Louis!

17:35.930 --> 17:37.055
Louis?

17:40.184 --> 17:42.060
Louis.

17:47.275 --> 17:50.902
Hey.

17:51.028 --> 17:53.029
Hey, I'm talking to you.

17:59.954 --> 18:02.038
I don't want
to be alone.

18:08.504 --> 18:12.048
Why did she have to die?

18:14.302 --> 18:17.012
There's no good reason.

18:17.096 --> 18:20.056
I don't know, man.

18:21.058 --> 18:23.310
I don't have anyone else.

18:26.439 --> 18:29.399
Hey, you're
gonna be all right.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.753
Hey! Hey!

19:34.340 --> 19:37.384
Hey, let's get
something to eat.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.344
I'm hungry.

19:40.930 --> 19:42.931
What's with these skis?

19:43.057 --> 19:45.100
For skiing.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.103
Yeah, well, there ain't
no snow around here.

19:51.148 --> 19:52.858
The skis were a gift
from my mom.

19:52.984 --> 19:55.026
You probably never
even skied before.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.695
She wanted me to learn.

19:56.821 --> 19:58.154
Skiing's expensive.

19:58.239 --> 20:00.156
I just saved you
a shitload of money.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.867
It was the last thing
she gave me before she died.

20:01.993 --> 20:03.869
Yeah, it's a dumb sport.

20:03.995 --> 20:06.475
I can't believe all you got was
$20 bucks and that stupid ring!

20:06.581 --> 20:08.498
Are you hungry?
I'm starving.

20:08.624 --> 20:09.833
Let's go.

20:15.882 --> 20:18.758
Mm, mm.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.177
Good.

20:22.597 --> 20:25.891
What, you're not gonna eat?

20:26.017 --> 20:27.183
I'm not hungry.

20:27.268 --> 20:29.811
Fine with me. Starve.

20:33.983 --> 20:35.942
Look at that
little piece of ass.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.739
Hey, you like women?

20:40.865 --> 20:42.449
Yeah, I guess.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.659
You guess?

20:44.785 --> 20:47.120
All right, well, know this.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.872
A scorned woman will
tear your heart out,

20:48.998 --> 20:51.082
put it between
two buns and eat it

20:51.208 --> 20:53.668
just as your life
slips away before you.

20:53.794 --> 20:56.212
Don't ever forget that.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.174
Hey, you wanna drive?

21:01.427 --> 21:03.970
Yeah? You wanna drive?

21:05.222 --> 21:07.474
All right, can you
see over the hood?

21:07.600 --> 21:09.392
I guess.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.978
All right.
Your feet touch the pedals?

21:12.104 --> 21:13.813
I think so.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.608
You think so or you can?
It's kind of a big deal.

21:16.734 --> 21:18.193
- Yeah, fine.
- Okay, all right.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.945
So this is an automatic.

21:20.071 --> 21:22.781
So all you gotta do is pull that
lever down from P to D.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.240
There you go.

21:24.241 --> 21:26.409
All right, now take your
foot off the brake.

21:26.535 --> 21:29.579
Push down on the gas.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.414
There you go.

21:35.836 --> 21:38.922
All you gotta do is avoid other
cars and that's pretty much it.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.174
How fast you going?

21:41.258 --> 21:43.259
Uh, 32 mph.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.970
No, no, no.
You gotta get it up.

21:45.096 --> 21:47.263
At least 50 or 60, even 70.

21:49.892 --> 21:54.270
There you go. See, faster is
way better, isn't it?

21:56.357 --> 21:57.440
You're blind! Oh!

21:57.566 --> 21:59.526
Oh!

22:03.197 --> 22:07.325
All right, the first rule to
gun fighting is having a gun.

22:07.451 --> 22:09.744
All right, I prefer
to have something small.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.454
Something easier to carry.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.873
Easier to conceal,
all right?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.750
Can't go hunting with
something like this, though.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.085
Why not?

22:17.211 --> 22:19.754
You just can't.
It ain't right.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.297
What's the point, then?

22:21.382 --> 22:23.883
The point is,
if I have the gun...

22:25.302 --> 22:28.430
I have the control, right?

22:28.556 --> 22:30.849
You want to give it a shot?

22:34.103 --> 22:36.396
If I let you shoot this,
you owe me a favor.

22:36.522 --> 22:37.981
Okay.

22:38.107 --> 22:39.315
All right.

22:41.736 --> 22:43.319
Go ahead.

22:52.329 --> 22:55.498
Go ahead,
shoot it again.

22:58.794 --> 22:59.669
All right.

22:59.795 --> 23:02.839
Turn it, gangster style.

23:02.965 --> 23:04.466
There you go.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.094
Let's go.

23:12.433 --> 23:14.476
Hey, give me my gun.

23:34.371 --> 23:38.374
Wake up.
Wake up.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.795
It's time for that favor.

24:01.690 --> 24:04.692
All right, now keep
the engine running.

24:04.819 --> 24:07.403
Don't turn it off for any
reason, you understand?

24:07.404 --> 24:09.322
Where you going?

24:09.406 --> 24:12.075
I gotta run inside and
grab a couple of things.

24:12.201 --> 24:13.284
Just keep it running.
I'll be right back.

24:13.410 --> 24:15.411
Now jump in
the driver's seat.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.205
Wait, what?

24:30.594 --> 24:33.429
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

24:37.059 --> 24:40.436
Let me know if I can
help you with anything.

24:40.437 --> 24:44.023
We got some
specials back there.

25:23.772 --> 25:26.357
Are you gonna get it?

25:26.483 --> 25:30.153
Yeah, that should...
oh, the newspaper.

25:30.279 --> 25:31.487
Get on the ground.

25:36.994 --> 25:38.661
Get on the fucking ground!

25:40.497 --> 25:43.458
- Get on the goddamned...
- I heard you!

25:43.542 --> 25:45.982
- I'll beat you with this fucking gun!
- I heard you, damn it!

26:03.520 --> 26:07.315
Listen, this store's all I got.
You leave me something you hear?

26:07.441 --> 26:08.483
There you go.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.526
You're a real
son of a bitch.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.491
Hey! What the hell
are you doing?

26:16.575 --> 26:19.410
Hey, hey!

26:19.536 --> 26:21.454
Get out of the fucking car!
Get out...

26:21.538 --> 26:22.997
Hands off the boy!

26:23.123 --> 26:25.250
Easy, easy!

26:25.376 --> 26:26.960
Go!

26:31.590 --> 26:33.216
Ha!

26:33.342 --> 26:35.510
All right!
Now keep it up over 70.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.074
Keep it on the right side
of the road.

26:37.137 --> 26:38.471
- Just like I told you.
- I'm gonna be sick.

26:38.555 --> 26:40.265
What do you mean,
you feel sick?

26:40.391 --> 26:42.558
- I'm sick, I'm sick.
- What are you doing?

26:42.559 --> 26:43.559
Hey! Hey!

26:43.560 --> 26:45.895
Get in the back!
Get in the back!

26:46.021 --> 26:48.147
Go, go, go, go!

26:52.403 --> 26:55.697
Oh, shit!
God damn it!

26:59.493 --> 27:01.369
Son of a bitch!

27:01.495 --> 27:03.579
- I need some air.
- Yeah, well, shut up!

27:06.792 --> 27:08.376
I need air.

27:13.090 --> 27:14.549
- I need some air!
- What are you doing?

27:14.633 --> 27:16.759
Shut that door!

27:20.014 --> 27:21.556
No!

27:26.520 --> 27:28.104
No!

27:28.230 --> 27:32.025
God damn it! God damn it!

27:46.332 --> 27:48.958
Stay here.

27:49.084 --> 27:50.877
Where you going?

28:09.313 --> 28:11.439
Get your things.

28:11.565 --> 28:13.775
- Where'd you get that car?
- Shut up and get in!

28:13.901 --> 28:15.568
Did you steal it?

28:15.652 --> 28:19.489
I will leave you here.
I swear to God, I will!

28:39.343 --> 28:42.678
You cost me a lot
of money today.

28:42.679 --> 28:45.681
I don't want anything
to do with you.

28:45.682 --> 28:49.227
Well, that's not
an option, is it?

28:49.353 --> 28:52.438
You can't make me stay.

28:52.564 --> 28:53.606
I can leave.

28:53.690 --> 28:55.233
Just hitchhike.

28:55.359 --> 28:58.611
Yeah, okay.
You're gonna hitchhike?

28:58.695 --> 29:00.446
Yeah.

29:05.702 --> 29:09.997
Why don't we find a place
to sleep tonight?

29:10.124 --> 29:10.998
With a bed?

29:11.125 --> 29:14.001
Yeah, sure.
Why not?

29:14.128 --> 29:16.712
Fine.

29:27.141 --> 29:29.642
You awake?

29:29.726 --> 29:31.477
What?

29:31.603 --> 29:33.729
Just wanted to see
if you were awake.

29:39.528 --> 29:40.736
Why'd you do it?

29:40.737 --> 29:41.737
Do what?

29:41.738 --> 29:44.449
Rob that place.

29:44.575 --> 29:48.744
Because we didn't have
any money and we needed it.

29:48.745 --> 29:50.329
To get me home?

29:50.456 --> 29:52.415
Yeah, to get you home.

29:52.541 --> 29:54.625
Food and gas.

29:54.751 --> 29:57.128
This bed.

29:57.254 --> 29:59.088
Why do you live in your car?

30:01.758 --> 30:04.760
Because I can't
afford anything else.

30:04.761 --> 30:06.554
Most adults have jobs...

30:06.680 --> 30:07.722
Just go to bed, Louis.

30:07.806 --> 30:10.975
Just go the fuck
to bed, please.

31:16.083 --> 31:17.291
All right.

31:19.503 --> 31:20.836
When you're done in there,

31:20.837 --> 31:22.713
I want you to pull
the truck around.

31:22.839 --> 31:23.839
Understand?

31:23.840 --> 31:26.551
Hey, you paying
attention to me?

31:26.677 --> 31:29.637
Yeah. I heard you.

31:29.763 --> 31:31.222
God damn it,
you pay attention!

31:31.348 --> 31:33.307
Wake up!

31:33.433 --> 31:36.060
You're not gonna go
fucking this up for me again.

32:04.881 --> 32:06.340
All right, Louis.

32:06.466 --> 32:08.217
Stop fucking around
and open up the door.

32:08.343 --> 32:09.885
A couple of days.

32:09.886 --> 32:11.804
That's how long
you said it would take.

32:11.888 --> 32:14.265
You're a liar.

32:14.391 --> 32:17.643
Open up the door.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.061
Come on!

32:20.772 --> 32:23.774
The fucking...
Open up the fucking door!

32:23.900 --> 32:25.818
God damn it! Okay.

32:25.902 --> 32:29.405
Now take your hands off the wheel
and get out of the car.

32:29.531 --> 32:30.948
Just one more day
and I'll take you

32:31.074 --> 32:32.450
to your grandparent's,
all right? Now come on.

32:32.576 --> 32:35.911
Open it up, please.

32:40.375 --> 32:41.917
You need me.

32:52.929 --> 32:57.099
Hello.
How's your day?

32:57.225 --> 33:00.102
Oh, just going great.

33:00.228 --> 33:01.937
Good-looking boy
you got there.

33:01.938 --> 33:04.857
Yeah, yeah, he
is adorable, isn't he?

33:04.941 --> 33:06.734
Got a daughter myself.

33:06.860 --> 33:09.820
Huh. I'll take $20
on two, please.

33:09.946 --> 33:12.490
No gas. Pump's broke.
Been broke for months.

33:12.616 --> 33:15.076
Oh, shit, all right.

33:15.202 --> 33:19.914
Would you grab me a can of that
Black Bear Longcut Wintergreen?

33:24.378 --> 33:26.962
You don't want any
trouble now, do you?

33:29.633 --> 33:31.050
- Open it up.
- Yeah.

33:31.176 --> 33:33.135
Ain't much in there.

33:33.261 --> 33:34.970
Well, that'll do.

33:37.974 --> 33:39.892
Boy, what are you doing?
Come on!

33:39.976 --> 33:41.102
This ain't no fucking library!
Hurry up!

33:41.228 --> 33:43.270
Quit pissing around!

33:43.397 --> 33:44.480
Now get back there
and clean that up.

33:44.606 --> 33:45.981
Come on.

34:00.789 --> 34:03.582
Come on.

34:03.709 --> 34:07.128
In and out just like
a couple of ghosts.

34:07.254 --> 34:08.545
Gimme that.

34:12.217 --> 34:13.801
Thank you, sir.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.896
You got a safe?

34:41.830 --> 34:44.123
Christ!

34:44.248 --> 34:46.000
Go, go, go, go!

34:53.049 --> 34:55.551
Fuck you!

34:57.763 --> 34:59.054
God damn it!

34:59.639 --> 34:59.680
God damn it,
I can't believe that.

34:59.681 --> 35:03.934
God damn it,
I can't believe that.

35:04.060 --> 35:06.937
Shit.

35:07.063 --> 35:08.606
I'll tell you what, boy.

35:08.732 --> 35:10.649
Life can be
such a bore sometimes.

35:10.776 --> 35:15.362
But this...
This is great.

35:15.489 --> 35:19.074
Well, don't
look at me like that.

35:19.075 --> 35:22.661
You and me make
a really, really good team.

35:22.788 --> 35:26.165
Shit, they probably got
nicknames for us already.

35:26.291 --> 35:28.000
Who? The papers?

35:28.084 --> 35:30.878
Yeah.

35:31.004 --> 35:32.404
Don't they have
better things to do?

35:32.464 --> 35:35.090
Shit, no. Bonnie and Clyde
was all over the newspapers.

35:35.091 --> 35:37.426
Billy the Kid, too.
He was famous.

35:37.552 --> 35:39.094
Like in movies?

35:39.179 --> 35:42.097
- Exactly.
- Mm-hmm.

35:42.182 --> 35:47.144
You know, in the movies,
they all got shot to death.

35:50.106 --> 35:52.107
Aren't you having fun?

35:52.108 --> 35:53.818
If I was your age,
I'd be having fun.

35:53.944 --> 35:56.654
No, I'm not having fun.

36:00.116 --> 36:01.826
You think this
is easy for me?

36:01.952 --> 36:04.119
Dragging your skinny
little ass all over the place?

36:04.120 --> 36:06.121
This ain't no fucking
holiday, all right?

36:06.122 --> 36:07.998
This is a job.

36:08.124 --> 36:10.084
This is work driving you home.

36:14.214 --> 36:17.424
You know, it'll all be
over soon enough, all right?

36:17.551 --> 36:19.385
Yeah, I hope so.

36:22.430 --> 36:26.141
Did you, uh...

36:26.142 --> 36:29.603
Did you see that shotgun under
the counter earlier today?

36:29.729 --> 36:30.855
No.

36:30.981 --> 36:32.147
No?

36:32.232 --> 36:33.858
I just figured you
might have seen it

36:33.984 --> 36:35.943
underneath there when you
were, you know, down below...

36:36.069 --> 36:38.153
I didn't see any gun.

36:39.447 --> 36:41.365
Okay.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.747
Ma'am?

36:48.874 --> 36:51.750
Do you have
chocolate ice cream?

36:51.877 --> 36:53.836
I'll have to check
in the freezer.

36:53.962 --> 36:57.172
Okay. Well, we'd like
one scoop.

36:57.173 --> 36:58.966
Two spoons for me
and the boy, please.

36:59.092 --> 37:01.886
One scoop and two spoons.

37:02.012 --> 37:02.887
Two spoons.
That's right.

37:03.013 --> 37:04.430
Okay.

37:09.185 --> 37:10.227
Let's go.

37:10.353 --> 37:12.313
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Ice cream.

37:12.439 --> 37:14.315
We're leaving.
Come on.

37:14.441 --> 37:17.109
- We have plenty of money.
- We gotta keep moving.

37:17.193 --> 37:18.313
I'm not even done
eating yet.

37:18.403 --> 37:20.946
Yes, you are.
Let's go.

37:31.458 --> 37:33.208
Get out here!

37:35.211 --> 37:36.462
God damn it.

37:36.588 --> 37:41.342
Here we go, honey.
One scoop and two spoons.

37:41.468 --> 37:42.468
I love chocolate.

37:42.510 --> 37:43.552
Thank you.

37:43.678 --> 37:46.221
Oh, he just needed
some fresh air.

37:46.306 --> 37:48.515
Uh, he'll be back, right?

37:48.642 --> 37:49.767
- Yes.
- Okay.

37:49.893 --> 37:54.229
I can share if you want some.

37:54.230 --> 37:55.356
Honey, I don't
need the calories.

37:55.482 --> 37:57.733
You enjoy that
chocolate ice cream.

37:57.859 --> 37:59.985
Let me know if I can
do something for you.

38:00.111 --> 38:01.654
Thank you.

38:15.418 --> 38:17.920
That'll be $14.50.

38:18.046 --> 38:19.046
Thank you.

38:19.172 --> 38:20.839
You're welcome, sweetie.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.511
I'll tell you what.

38:25.637 --> 38:29.390
You tell his mama that
she raised a gem of a boy.

38:29.516 --> 38:31.809
Yeah, I'll be sure
to tell her that.

39:25.030 --> 39:27.489
We gotta get rid
of that truck.

39:27.615 --> 39:29.033
I like that truck.

39:29.159 --> 39:32.453
Yeah, well, it's not
safe to drive anymore.

40:05.070 --> 40:07.237
Come on, let's go.

40:13.870 --> 40:15.621
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

40:15.747 --> 40:20.501
Come on, lady!
I got a kid here!

40:20.627 --> 40:21.627
Jesus Christ.

40:21.669 --> 40:22.961
We should have
kept the truck.

40:23.088 --> 40:25.672
Yeah, well...

40:25.799 --> 40:29.093
Hey!

40:29.219 --> 40:32.596
Just keep walking.
Just keep walking.

40:37.310 --> 40:38.185
Shit!

40:38.311 --> 40:39.770
Keep your mouth shut.

40:39.896 --> 40:42.272
Neither one of us want
to go to jail, right?

40:49.197 --> 40:50.864
Hello, Officer!

40:52.200 --> 40:54.201
Hitchhiking is illegal.

40:54.327 --> 40:56.411
Particularly on Sunday.

40:56.412 --> 40:58.789
Yeah, our car broke down.

40:58.915 --> 41:02.417
Uh-huh.
Let me see some ID.

41:02.418 --> 41:04.169
Come on.

41:07.507 --> 41:10.968
Turn around, over there.
Spread your legs. Come on.

41:11.094 --> 41:12.302
Where you headed?

41:12.428 --> 41:16.431
Uh, his grandparents' place.

41:16.432 --> 41:18.308
I'm real sorry
about this, officer.

41:18.434 --> 41:21.186
It's just that, you know,
we didn't have much of a choice.

41:21.312 --> 41:24.481
Our truck broke
down back there, so...

41:24.607 --> 41:27.442
Well, now is it a car
or is it a truck?

41:30.029 --> 41:31.822
He meant car.

41:31.948 --> 41:33.991
You better both come with me.

41:34.117 --> 41:35.784
We'll clear this up
down at the station.

41:35.910 --> 41:37.578
Come on.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.212
Uh, sir?

41:47.338 --> 41:49.715
We're just on our
way to church.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.383
What was that?

41:51.467 --> 41:54.636
We're going to church
to pray for my mom.

41:54.762 --> 41:57.055
Yeah, his mama died.

41:57.182 --> 41:58.765
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

41:58.892 --> 42:01.476
Is that right, son?
Your mama just died?

42:01.561 --> 42:04.479
Yes, sir.
Just last week.

42:04.480 --> 42:07.232
I'm sorry to hear that.

42:07.358 --> 42:08.817
All right, get in the car.
I'll give you a ride.

42:08.943 --> 42:10.360
- Come on.
- No, no, we can do...

42:10.486 --> 42:12.154
No, it's all right.
Don't worry.

42:12.280 --> 42:15.073
Come on.
Don't make me wait.

42:15.200 --> 42:17.284
Can I sit in the front?

42:17.410 --> 42:19.870
Sure.

42:24.375 --> 42:24.458
Thank you, Officer!

42:24.459 --> 42:26.501
Thank you, Officer!

42:29.714 --> 42:33.467
All right, let's get
the hell out of here.

42:33.551 --> 42:37.221
Hey, where you going?

42:37.347 --> 42:38.639
Church.

42:38.765 --> 42:40.515

- Amen!

43:26.187 --> 43:30.565
I am so pleased to see some
visitors with us this morning.

43:31.818 --> 43:34.528
Come on up here, son.

43:34.612 --> 43:37.030
Come on up here, son!

43:37.156 --> 43:38.448
I'm not gonna bite you.

43:38.574 --> 43:39.825
Come join me here.

43:39.951 --> 43:42.619
There you go.
Let him by there.

43:42.745 --> 43:44.913
Here you are.

43:45.039 --> 43:46.581
What is your name, son?

43:46.582 --> 43:47.582
Louis.

43:49.043 --> 43:51.503
Everyone please welcome
our child of God, Louis.

43:51.587 --> 43:53.630
- Welcome, Louis.
- Welcome.

43:53.756 --> 43:55.382
What is your name?

43:55.508 --> 43:56.883
John.

43:57.010 --> 43:58.176
- John.
- Yep.

43:58.303 --> 43:59.344
Why won't you join us?

43:59.470 --> 44:01.096
Nah, I'm good right here.

44:01.222 --> 44:03.307
No, no. I'm extending my hand
in the name of the Lord

44:03.433 --> 44:05.600
so we may greet you
as a congregation.

44:05.601 --> 44:09.146
If you wouldn't mind removing your cap
here in the house of the Lord?

44:13.276 --> 44:16.403
Everyone please welcome
these brothers in Christ,

44:16.529 --> 44:18.697
John and Louis.

44:18.823 --> 44:20.907
Welcome, John and Louis.

44:21.034 --> 44:23.952
Thank you.

44:24.078 --> 44:25.537
Thank you.

44:25.621 --> 44:26.955
Yeah, can we sit?

44:27.081 --> 44:28.373
- Please do.
- All right.

44:28.499 --> 44:30.876
Take your seat, gentlemen.

44:45.683 --> 44:48.226
We don't see too many
new faces around here.

44:48.353 --> 44:50.645
It's exciting when we do.

44:50.646 --> 44:52.397
We won't be staying for long.

44:52.523 --> 44:54.191
What, you just
passing through?

44:54.317 --> 44:55.942
Yeah.

44:56.069 --> 44:58.195
Listen, I want you
to know something.

44:58.321 --> 44:59.404
You're welcome to stay
as long as you like.

44:59.530 --> 45:03.325
My mission is
to grow this family.

45:03.451 --> 45:05.952
Spread the word of God.

45:06.079 --> 45:10.791
Well, like I said,
we won't be staying for long.

45:11.918 --> 45:13.668
All right.

45:14.962 --> 45:17.547
He's a quiet one.

45:17.673 --> 45:19.758
Got many friends?

45:19.884 --> 45:21.843
I have no idea.

45:21.969 --> 45:23.428
A boy needs friends, you know.

45:23.554 --> 45:25.138
Jesus had 12 of them.

45:25.264 --> 45:26.681
Yeah.

45:26.682 --> 45:28.225
Well, look what good
that did him.

45:29.936 --> 45:31.686
Listen, we're having
a retreat tonight.

45:31.771 --> 45:32.938
Want to stick around?
The boy will love it.

45:33.064 --> 45:34.064
You gonna have
food there?

45:35.733 --> 45:38.693
We'll have food there.

45:38.778 --> 45:41.071
One piece of advice.

45:41.197 --> 45:43.031
What's that?

45:43.157 --> 45:46.701
You want to save a little room
for the coconut cream pie.

45:46.702 --> 45:48.453
Good to know.

45:49.705 --> 45:51.415
Louis, hello, my friend.

45:51.541 --> 45:52.958
- Hi.
- How are you, son?

45:53.084 --> 45:54.709
Good, thank you.

45:54.710 --> 45:55.710
I'm gonna sit here and
join you if you don't mind.

45:55.711 --> 45:56.962
It's fine.

45:57.088 --> 45:58.046
We're happy to have
you with us today.

45:58.172 --> 45:59.840
Happy to be here.

45:59.966 --> 46:02.509
So tell me about yourself.

46:39.130 --> 46:40.755
Hey.

46:40.756 --> 46:43.758
Louis. Louis?
Hey, hey, wake up.

46:47.763 --> 46:48.763
We gotta hit the road.
Come on.

46:48.764 --> 46:51.141
What the hell is...

46:55.688 --> 46:57.689
What the hell
are you doing?

46:57.773 --> 46:59.524
- Come on.
- I don't want... I'm not fucking leaving!

46:59.650 --> 47:01.485
Come on, it's time to go.

47:01.611 --> 47:04.362
- What the hell's your problem?
- Hey, come on!

47:06.073 --> 47:07.657
Come on!

47:14.790 --> 47:16.416
This is yours.

47:26.719 --> 47:28.386
I hate you.

47:29.472 --> 47:31.598
I think you were scared.

47:31.724 --> 47:34.976
You're scared they'd find out
you're a bad person.

47:35.102 --> 47:37.812
A wolf, like
the pastor said.

47:37.813 --> 47:40.774
A wolf?
He called me a wolf?

47:40.858 --> 47:43.818
Beware of false prophets
who wear sheep's clothing

47:43.903 --> 47:47.989
because really
they're ravenous wolves.

47:48.115 --> 47:51.159
He said that?

47:51.285 --> 47:55.080
That's...

47:55.206 --> 47:56.498
I'm not doing
this anymore.

47:56.624 --> 47:57.499
What do you mean,
you're not doing this?

47:57.625 --> 47:58.750
I'm not doing it.

47:58.834 --> 48:01.086
Hey, get up!
Come on!

48:01.212 --> 48:02.921
We've been over this!

48:03.047 --> 48:05.215
Hey, get up!

48:05.341 --> 48:06.841
We gotta keep moving.

48:09.303 --> 48:10.762
Hey!

48:10.846 --> 48:12.764
Can't just sit
around all day!

48:12.848 --> 48:14.849
Come on!
Let's go!

48:26.112 --> 48:28.321
Thank you.

48:28.447 --> 48:30.365
I need a lift for me
and my friend back here.

48:30.491 --> 48:32.617
Just take a minute.
Hold on one second.

48:32.743 --> 48:34.828
Louis! Come on!

48:43.963 --> 48:46.423
Louis.

49:05.901 --> 49:07.819
Grab our things and take
them to the room, will ya?

49:07.903 --> 49:08.987
I'm gonna go grab a drink.

49:09.113 --> 49:10.697
How long?

49:10.823 --> 49:13.033
I don't know.
As long as it takes me.

49:22.918 --> 49:25.503
Give me a whiskey
and a beer chaser.

49:58.162 --> 50:02.290
- Oh, God.
- Okay.

50:02.416 --> 50:03.958
Ah!

51:18.033 --> 51:19.633
I don't know where the damn kid is.

51:19.702 --> 51:20.618
How can you drink those things?

51:20.745 --> 51:22.036
They give me heartburn.

51:22.121 --> 51:26.166
Yeah? I think they're just
fine in the morning.

51:28.127 --> 51:30.211
Oh, there he is!

51:30.337 --> 51:31.796
Great.

51:31.922 --> 51:34.924
This is Louis,
Louis Moody.

51:35.050 --> 51:37.051
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.

51:37.052 --> 51:41.389
I'm Mary.
This is Rose.

51:41.515 --> 51:43.308
Mary and Rose are
headed into Mexico.

51:43.434 --> 51:45.393
That's right.
You're gonna pay for the gas, huh?

51:45.519 --> 51:47.061
'Cause she pissed off
our meal ticket!

51:47.062 --> 51:49.063
Oh, Rose, shut up!

51:49.064 --> 51:51.065
So there you have it.

51:51.150 --> 51:52.550
Well, get in.
You're driving, right?

51:52.651 --> 51:53.902
Oh, yeah.

51:58.073 --> 51:59.866
Should I put
the stuff in the trunk?

51:59.992 --> 52:01.451
- Just throw it in the back.
- Back there?

52:01.577 --> 52:04.454
Why don't you guys both
get in the way back?

52:04.580 --> 52:08.500
We got some adult
conversations to have.

52:12.755 --> 52:13.880
Get in.

52:14.006 --> 52:15.465
This is gonna be fun.

52:29.104 --> 52:32.106
Were you the one
knocking on my wall?

52:32.191 --> 52:34.651
No.

52:34.777 --> 52:37.779
Yes, you were.

52:37.905 --> 52:39.155
Why didn't
you knock back?

52:39.281 --> 52:40.698
That's how it works,
you know.

52:40.825 --> 52:41.991
You're supposed
to knock back.

52:42.117 --> 52:44.244
I don't know.

52:44.370 --> 52:46.079
How old are you anyway?

52:46.163 --> 52:48.456
I'm 13.

52:48.582 --> 52:51.167
Well, I mean, I guess, 14.

52:51.293 --> 52:54.462
I'm 13.

52:54.588 --> 52:56.881
Is that your mom?

52:57.007 --> 52:58.883
You could call her that.

52:59.009 --> 53:03.429
It's that you don't look
like each other, so...

53:03.556 --> 53:04.848
I was just wondering.

53:04.974 --> 53:08.226
People say I take
after my dad.

53:08.352 --> 53:10.144
People say I take
after my mom.

53:19.530 --> 53:22.907
That's an amethyst.

53:23.033 --> 53:24.617
That's turquoise.

53:24.743 --> 53:27.912
Oh, I know turquoise. I got a...
check that out.

53:28.038 --> 53:29.330
Brand new ring.

53:29.456 --> 53:32.083
- That's nice.
- Turquoise.

53:32.167 --> 53:34.168
Well, that's what
they call kismet.

53:34.169 --> 53:36.087
Oh, yeah?
What's that mean?

53:36.171 --> 53:39.674
Well, it's a Middle Eastern word
for coincidence or serendipity.

53:39.800 --> 53:42.552
Ah, kismet.

53:42.678 --> 53:43.970
Kismet.

53:44.096 --> 53:46.764
So here's the deal.
You pay for the gas.

53:46.891 --> 53:48.291
We'll pay for our
own lodging, okay?

53:48.350 --> 53:49.976
All right.

53:50.102 --> 53:52.979
You know, I don't just let
any stranger into my car.

53:53.105 --> 53:55.189
These are unique circumstances,
you understand?

53:55.274 --> 53:57.942
I understand
completely,

53:58.068 --> 54:00.862
and we're not exactly
strangers at this point.

54:00.988 --> 54:03.740
Just don't get any ideas,
lover boy.

54:03.866 --> 54:05.199
I won't get any.

54:05.200 --> 54:08.119
Well, I might get
a couple ideas.

54:08.203 --> 54:10.622
I'll just keep 'em
right up in here.

54:37.274 --> 54:39.317
Don't go telling 'em
too much about yourself.

54:39.443 --> 54:42.695
Remember what
I told you about women.

54:42.821 --> 54:45.782
Well, look at us.
Just like one big happy family.

54:45.908 --> 54:47.867
Hardly.

54:47.952 --> 54:48.868
Hey, you know what I think we
should do?

54:48.953 --> 54:50.453
We should go shopping.

54:50.537 --> 54:53.206
Might as well have a little fun
while we're on this trip, right?

54:53.290 --> 54:55.917
I don't know.

54:56.043 --> 54:57.293
She loves buying stuff.

54:59.880 --> 55:04.133
All right, y'all.
What do you think?

55:04.259 --> 55:07.011
Well, well, well.
Just like Miss America.

55:08.138 --> 55:09.973
Can we go now?

55:10.099 --> 55:11.432
I'm gonna buy that for you.

55:11.558 --> 55:14.435
- We need that money.
- I got plenty.

55:14.561 --> 55:17.271
I'm gonna go pick out
some things for the kids.

55:25.698 --> 55:27.323
Oh, yeah.

55:30.953 --> 55:32.286
I hate dresses.

55:32.287 --> 55:33.871
You two look adorable.

55:33.998 --> 55:36.499
You look nice.

55:53.767 --> 55:56.060
You know, I'm usually a pretty
good judge of character.

55:56.186 --> 55:59.397
But I'm gonna admit
I read y'all wrong.

55:59.523 --> 56:03.109
I thought you were gonna
be greedy and selfish

56:03.235 --> 56:05.570
like most of the men
I've been with.

56:05.696 --> 56:10.324
But you ain't
and I like you.

56:10.325 --> 56:13.327
Yeah? Well,
I like you too.

56:16.123 --> 56:18.249
You know, my mama
always said,

56:18.333 --> 56:23.254
"Don't waste time waiting
for the perfect man because,

56:23.338 --> 56:27.008
well, life is too
goddamned short."

56:27.134 --> 56:29.343
That's what she said?

56:43.358 --> 56:45.902
Wish I could just
run away, don't you?

56:48.363 --> 56:50.281
I don't know.

56:50.365 --> 56:53.951
There's nowhere
to really run off to.

56:55.621 --> 56:57.955
Where would you even go?

56:58.082 --> 57:01.542
Ever been to the beach?

57:01.668 --> 57:04.462
Never really had a chance to.

57:04.588 --> 57:06.380
That's where I'd go.

57:06.381 --> 57:08.299
Somewhere with a beach.

57:08.383 --> 57:11.302
You could always come
to the beach with me and,

57:11.386 --> 57:14.305
you know, we could have
our sandcastle house.

57:14.389 --> 57:18.142
Go fishing.
We'd survive on fish.

57:18.268 --> 57:21.562
Could be a lot worse.

57:21.688 --> 57:24.315
If you could, if there
was any place on Earth

57:24.399 --> 57:26.901
you could run away to,
where'd you run?

57:27.027 --> 57:30.196
If I had to choose?

57:32.908 --> 57:34.617
I'd probably go home.

57:36.078 --> 57:38.412
Pretty exciting, right?

57:38.413 --> 57:40.832
Is that in New Mexico?

57:43.627 --> 57:45.461
I don't know.

58:24.459 --> 58:27.461
Well, come on.

58:27.462 --> 58:29.922
Tell me something
about yourself.

58:30.048 --> 58:31.549
Well, there's not
much to tell.

58:31.675 --> 58:33.509
I don't much like
talking about myself.

58:33.635 --> 58:35.261
It's not easy for me.

58:35.387 --> 58:38.848
Fine.
What about the boy?

58:38.974 --> 58:40.808
His mother died.

58:44.980 --> 58:46.480
And?

58:46.481 --> 58:48.816
I'm taking him to live
with his grandparents.

58:48.942 --> 58:52.236
Well, why go through
all that trouble?

58:52.362 --> 58:54.655
Well, because
he's a good kid.

58:54.781 --> 58:56.616
I don't mind
spending time with him.

58:56.742 --> 58:58.784
Uh-huh.

58:58.911 --> 59:00.536
What's in it for you?

59:03.290 --> 59:06.375
There ain't nothing
in it for me.

59:06.501 --> 59:10.004
You're lying.

59:10.130 --> 59:11.672
You're a liar.

59:14.301 --> 59:16.385
Is he yours?

59:25.312 --> 59:27.063
Look at you.

59:45.332 --> 59:47.875
I ain't no fucking liar.

01:00:00.055 --> 01:00:02.556
You're way better.
I'm not even making...

01:00:02.557 --> 01:00:04.058
Snap, snap, clap.

01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:05.768
I can't snap.

01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:13.526
Hey, you know we're not far
from my grandparents' house.

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:14.690
My mom said it snows there.

01:00:14.778 --> 01:00:16.570
I've never seen snow.

01:00:16.571 --> 01:00:18.739
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:21.575
You should come.

01:00:21.576 --> 01:00:24.245
I mean, you know,
if you wanted.

01:00:24.371 --> 01:00:25.579
It'd be cool.

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:29.041
Yeah. Sounds fun.

01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:30.584
Yeah.

01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:44.181
Yeah?

01:00:44.308 --> 01:00:46.600
Hey, let me talk to George.
It's John.

01:00:46.685 --> 01:00:48.602
John?

01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:49.895
How's the head?

01:00:50.022 --> 01:00:52.189
Oh, just fine.
How's your sister?

01:00:58.488 --> 01:01:01.365
Hey, John.
Any luck in finding my money?

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:03.200
I've got the rest
of your $10,000.

01:01:03.327 --> 01:01:05.202
So you're 10 short.

01:01:05.329 --> 01:01:07.496
How about this?
I bring you what I have.

01:01:07.622 --> 01:01:09.165
Or you can come
looking for the rest.

01:01:09.291 --> 01:01:13.627
Maybe I'll go and look
for it in New Mexico.

01:01:13.628 --> 01:01:16.172
Farmington, New Mexico.

01:01:16.298 --> 01:01:18.924
Maybe I'll find
my money over there.

01:01:19.051 --> 01:01:21.344
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:23.512
Of course you don't.

01:01:23.638 --> 01:01:26.015
$20,000, John.

01:01:26.141 --> 01:01:28.851
See you soon.

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:54.001
Our hometown ain't
far from here.

01:01:54.127 --> 01:01:55.961
Y'all can stay with us
if you want.

01:01:56.088 --> 01:01:58.005
Oh, yeah? How long?

01:01:59.674 --> 01:02:01.467
As long as you want.

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:05.179
Yeah, I don't know about that.

01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:08.682
I think that this little thing

01:02:08.683 --> 01:02:10.434
has probably run its course.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.437
So we should
probably get going.

01:02:14.689 --> 01:02:15.898
Wow.

01:02:18.777 --> 01:02:20.694
Well, fuck you, John.

01:02:20.779 --> 01:02:24.657
Well, I think we've already
done that, haven't we?

01:02:29.204 --> 01:02:30.788
Louis.

01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:33.374
John tell you why
he's taking you home?

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.060
Yeah, he's taking me
to my grandparents.

01:02:35.168 --> 01:02:37.086
No, baby.
Did he tell you why?

01:02:37.212 --> 01:02:39.004
I think you should probably
quit while you're ahead.

01:02:39.131 --> 01:02:43.634
Well, I think I'd like
to fill in the blanks, okay?

01:02:43.718 --> 01:02:46.429
John strikes me as
the type of guy who's failed

01:02:46.555 --> 01:02:47.847
at just about everything
he's ever done.

01:02:47.973 --> 01:02:49.473
Am I right?

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:52.852
You always had luck with
the ladies, didn't you?

01:02:52.978 --> 01:02:55.479
But that never lasted

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:57.731
and somewhere along the way,
all those big plans,

01:02:57.816 --> 01:03:01.402
well, they fell apart
and you got desperate.

01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:03.863
A little lonely.

01:03:03.989 --> 01:03:05.781
That's why the idea
of dragging him around,

01:03:05.907 --> 01:03:08.451
well, wasn't so bad,
was it?

01:03:08.577 --> 01:03:09.869
Mom...

01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:13.873
Don't worry, honey.
He ain't like us.

01:03:13.999 --> 01:03:17.918
Men like him don't have the balls
to survive in the real world.

01:03:18.044 --> 01:03:19.503
All right, listen, lady...

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:23.048
But the one who's got
the most to lose is you.

01:03:23.175 --> 01:03:25.759
Do you even know
who he is, honey?

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.803
'Cause he's using you.

01:03:29.931 --> 01:03:32.766
Just like he used me.

01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:39.690
Just like he
uses everybody.

01:03:39.774 --> 01:03:41.984
This is bullshit.

01:03:48.783 --> 01:03:51.118
They always run.

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:10.930
John?

01:04:11.056 --> 01:04:12.598
- John?
- Get back inside, Louis!

01:04:12.724 --> 01:04:15.809
John, let's just leave.
We can find another ride.

01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:18.854
Louis, get back inside.

01:04:23.235 --> 01:04:25.694
John, she doesn't
know anything about you.

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:28.072
She's right, Louis.
I am afraid.

01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:32.826
And I just can't take living
like everyone else, you know?

01:04:32.911 --> 01:04:36.121
The problem is, there's
certain things about me

01:04:36.248 --> 01:04:37.998
that I just can't
seem to change.

01:04:38.124 --> 01:04:41.627
John.
John, stop.

01:04:41.753 --> 01:04:43.379
John!

01:04:59.145 --> 01:05:00.813
I knew there was
something wrong with him.

01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:03.190
Come on, Louis.
We're gonna take you home.

01:05:03.316 --> 01:05:05.859
It's not gonna
end well, honey.

01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:09.863
Come on, get in.

01:05:09.864 --> 01:05:11.532
Come on, it's okay.

01:05:21.793 --> 01:05:24.878
Louis! What are you doing?

01:05:29.134 --> 01:05:32.386
Get over!

01:05:32.512 --> 01:05:33.887
Get down!

01:05:40.895 --> 01:05:43.022
God damn it!

01:05:44.816 --> 01:05:46.442
God damn it!

01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:49.194
This is a lot of money.

01:05:49.321 --> 01:05:51.947
We could fly to Farmington
if we wanted.

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:08.213
You know what she said
about you wasn't true.

01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:12.843
I don't know, she split me
wide open, didn't she?

01:06:12.927 --> 01:06:15.846
You know, when I was in jail,

01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:17.306
everyone wanted
to blame everyone else

01:06:17.432 --> 01:06:19.850
for who they
turned out to be.

01:06:19.934 --> 01:06:23.562
Mom, dad, girlfriend, wife.

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:28.942
I made a lot
of mistakes in my life.

01:06:31.446 --> 01:06:34.406
But they were my mistakes,
nobody else's.

01:06:35.867 --> 01:06:38.202
They're mine.

01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:39.870
You know, when you
get older, Louis,

01:06:39.954 --> 01:06:44.500
all those mistakes start
piling up inside you.

01:06:44.626 --> 01:06:47.002
Just a pile of mistakes.

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:51.548
Regrets, blame.

01:06:54.969 --> 01:06:57.846
It's enough to make you
feel sick to your stomach.

01:07:00.225 --> 01:07:02.976
Secrets make me
feel like that.

01:07:02.977 --> 01:07:05.813
Yeah, secrets, too.

01:07:09.818 --> 01:07:11.235
You got many secrets?

01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:14.321
Yeah, plenty.

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:15.989
How about you?

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:20.869
Yeah.

01:07:20.995 --> 01:07:22.538
I like that girl.

01:07:22.664 --> 01:07:23.997
Shit, that ain't no secret.

01:07:27.001 --> 01:07:29.420
Yeah.

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:36.009
Tell me one
of your secrets.

01:07:40.807 --> 01:07:43.016
Maybe some other time.

01:08:33.067 --> 01:08:35.027
John?

01:08:45.705 --> 01:08:47.413
John?

01:08:52.754 --> 01:08:54.421
John?

01:09:08.185 --> 01:09:09.560
Hey!

01:09:14.274 --> 01:09:15.859
Look at that.

01:09:38.758 --> 01:09:41.134
Hey, we need some
food for the road.

01:09:41.219 --> 01:09:44.429
All right.
I'm gonna go grab some gas.

01:09:44.555 --> 01:09:46.055
Let's meet back
here in ten minutes.

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:48.140
All right,
you go first.

01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:56.149
Watch out.

01:10:01.406 --> 01:10:03.198
Go on!

01:10:09.831 --> 01:10:12.833
Our APO here is 96309.

01:10:12.959 --> 01:10:15.419
So drop us a line,
anytime, APO 96309

01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:16.420
and we'll get it on.

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:17.671
Anything else?

01:10:17.797 --> 01:10:19.548
Oh, that's it.
Thanks.

01:10:19.674 --> 01:10:21.758
This is the 11:00 report
featuring John Marks

01:10:21.885 --> 01:10:23.635
with the news and sports.

01:10:23.761 --> 01:10:26.138
A brazen daytime robbery
of the Alpine Savings Bank

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:28.432
has state police looking
for an unidentified man

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:30.475
and his teenage accomplice.

01:10:30.602 --> 01:10:34.187
They were last seen traveling
west on Farm Road 369

01:10:34.188 --> 01:10:39.192
in a tan station wagon with
Texas license plates 74EJQ8.

01:10:44.699 --> 01:10:45.908
Are we going to jail?

01:10:46.034 --> 01:10:47.993
Nah, we ain't
going to jail.

01:10:50.788 --> 01:10:52.539
You scared?

01:10:52.665 --> 01:10:54.207
No.

01:10:56.377 --> 01:10:58.170
I'm scared.

01:10:59.213 --> 01:11:03.550
What are we gonna do?

01:11:03.676 --> 01:11:05.385
I don't know.

01:11:08.222 --> 01:11:11.099
Oh, what a mess.

01:11:14.687 --> 01:11:16.563
We should go to Mexico.

01:11:18.316 --> 01:11:21.401
We could live there for
years with all this money.

01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:25.155
We should get a car, but...

01:11:25.239 --> 01:11:26.949
we could do that.

01:11:27.075 --> 01:11:30.369
- Give me a rock.
- Oh, I got it.

01:12:11.369 --> 01:12:13.954
I liked the
station wagon better.

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:18.291
Yeah, well, nobody's gonna
be missing this piece of shit.

01:12:18.292 --> 01:12:20.293
I can tell you that much.

01:12:20.378 --> 01:12:24.214
Be nice if we could
this thing up over 50.

01:12:24.298 --> 01:12:26.258
I figure we'll drive
about halfway there

01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:28.510
then find a quiet place
to camp for the night.

01:12:30.596 --> 01:12:32.305
What's it gonna be like?

01:12:32.306 --> 01:12:35.434
What?
Your grandparents' place?

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:37.978
Yep.

01:12:39.022 --> 01:12:40.647
I don't know.

01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:42.983
I imagine it'll be beautiful.

01:12:47.905 --> 01:12:50.407
Think we'll be there tomorrow?

01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:54.119
Oh, yeah.
We should be there by lunch.

01:12:56.372 --> 01:12:59.332
First we have to make it
through the desert.

01:13:01.419 --> 01:13:03.962
Then we'll cross
into the mountains.

01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:11.261
We'll know we're getting close
when we can see the farmlands.

01:13:11.345 --> 01:13:15.140
Green, as far as
the eye can see.

01:13:20.271 --> 01:13:23.315
Just like
that picture?

01:13:25.026 --> 01:13:28.361
Yeah, just like
the picture.

01:14:36.806 --> 01:14:40.433
Let me get that for you.

01:14:46.107 --> 01:14:47.482
There you go.

01:14:52.446 --> 01:14:55.115
You're looking
good there, partner.

01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:56.616
I want to make
a good impression, you know?

01:14:56.742 --> 01:14:58.451
Let's go.

01:15:23.477 --> 01:15:25.020
Fill it up, will you?

01:15:37.783 --> 01:15:40.869
- Morning.
- Good morning.

01:16:04.602 --> 01:16:07.520
He almost
finished out there?

01:16:07.605 --> 01:16:08.855
Yeah, almost.

01:16:17.531 --> 01:16:19.950
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

01:16:20.993 --> 01:16:24.454
Hello?

01:16:24.538 --> 01:16:26.706
What's the address
of your emergency?

01:16:30.544 --> 01:16:31.586
That'll be it.

01:16:31.712 --> 01:16:34.547
Okay, it's $20 on pump, $24.

01:16:34.548 --> 01:16:36.800
$24. That's a steal.

01:16:42.556 --> 01:16:44.557
You have a good day.

01:16:51.816 --> 01:16:53.566
Boy?

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:02.742
You're the one
from the paper.

01:17:02.868 --> 01:17:07.372
I think you got me confused
with somebody else, all right?

01:17:07.498 --> 01:17:09.582
No. I know who you are.

01:17:09.583 --> 01:17:11.960
I know who he is too.

01:17:27.768 --> 01:17:31.146
The truth, sir...

01:17:37.528 --> 01:17:40.613
The truth is,
he's my son

01:17:40.614 --> 01:17:43.616
and all I've ever done
is disappoint him.

01:17:46.787 --> 01:17:49.289
I've abandoned him.

01:17:49.415 --> 01:17:52.417
I've lied to him.

01:17:52.543 --> 01:17:55.211
I found every
excuse that I can

01:17:55.338 --> 01:17:58.631
just to make him another
mistake in my life.

01:17:58.716 --> 01:18:02.635
A secret that
I keep to myself.

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:08.641
But he won't let me.

01:18:08.642 --> 01:18:12.812
Please, just
let me make it right.

01:18:14.565 --> 01:18:17.275
Just please
let me make it right.

01:18:25.659 --> 01:18:27.911
Come on.
Grab your bag!

01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:30.663
Don't you hear that?

01:18:30.748 --> 01:18:34.209
Do you remember
the address?

01:18:34.335 --> 01:18:35.585
What?

01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:37.337
Do you remember
what the place looks like?

01:18:37.463 --> 01:18:39.672
Do you remember the address?

01:18:39.673 --> 01:18:43.218
What's going on?

01:18:43.344 --> 01:18:45.929
All right, I need
you to leave.

01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:47.430
I'm not leaving you.

01:18:47.556 --> 01:18:49.682
I promised this guy
in there I wouldn't run

01:18:49.683 --> 01:18:51.851
'cause I can't run anymore.

01:18:55.314 --> 01:18:58.691
I see myself as a person
that I'm supposed to be.

01:18:58.692 --> 01:19:02.237
A good person, the kind
of person that you deserve.

01:19:02.363 --> 01:19:04.239
I just...

01:19:04.365 --> 01:19:05.573
I don't have the courage
to be that person.

01:19:05.699 --> 01:19:06.783
I don't have the courage
to change.

01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:08.701
Do you understand
what I'm trying to say?

01:19:08.786 --> 01:19:10.995
Here, take this with you.

01:19:11.122 --> 01:19:14.499
Take it with you, and go.

01:19:14.625 --> 01:19:16.585
I need you to go, all right?
You're gonna be okay.

01:19:16.710 --> 01:19:18.795
Hey, you're gonna
be all right.

01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:20.713
Now go, go, go, go.

01:19:20.798 --> 01:19:23.299
I don't want to leave, John.
I don't want to leave you.

01:19:23.426 --> 01:19:26.386
You gotta go. Go.

01:19:26.512 --> 01:19:27.387
I don't want to leave you, John.

01:19:27.513 --> 01:19:29.180
Go! Run, god damn it!

01:19:29.306 --> 01:19:30.849
Run!

01:19:46.031 --> 01:19:48.616
Face the car!
Hands in the air!

01:21:47.361 --> 01:21:52.115
What do you think it's going to be like?

01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:54.450
I'd imagine it'd be beautiful.

01:21:56.579 --> 01:21:59.330
Surrounded by farmland as
far as the eye can see.

01:22:01.959 --> 01:22:04.877
Just like that picture?

01:22:04.878 --> 01:22:09.132
Yeah, just like
the picture.

01:22:38.078 --> 01:22:40.455
We're going to do
a quick line inspection here

01:22:40.581 --> 01:22:42.624
in Farmington, New Mexico.

01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:44.167
Line number seven.

01:24:57.092 --> 01:24:59.385
You lost?

01:25:06.769 --> 01:25:09.020
I need to get
to Farmington.

01:25:09.104 --> 01:25:12.732
You are lost.

01:25:12.858 --> 01:25:14.150
I'm not lost.

01:25:14.276 --> 01:25:17.069
Oh, whatever you say.

01:25:17.154 --> 01:25:20.865
Yeah, you're close.

01:25:23.076 --> 01:25:26.704
It's up that road about
an hour or so.

01:25:28.457 --> 01:25:30.082
An hour?

01:25:30.083 --> 01:25:33.836
Yeah,
at least an hour.

01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:36.214
But you're young.

01:25:43.096 --> 01:25:46.182
You could give me a ride.

01:25:46.308 --> 01:25:49.101
I could, yeah.

01:25:51.146 --> 01:25:56.025
I'd be a lot more willing if
we was to bargain for it.

01:25:56.109 --> 01:25:58.361
Kid with that kind of
silver ain't gonna have

01:25:58.487 --> 01:26:01.739
a hard time finding
a ride home.

01:26:05.118 --> 01:26:07.370
How about it, kid?

01:26:18.799 --> 01:26:23.469
23 Farm Road. 23 Farm Road.

01:27:46.428 --> 01:27:49.221
Louis?

01:27:49.222 --> 01:27:50.723
Hey, Grandma.

01:27:50.849 --> 01:27:53.225
Oh, thank you, Lord!

01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:56.896
Oh, we thought
we'd lost you forever!

01:27:59.232 --> 01:28:03.194
You were supposed
to be here days ago.

01:28:03.278 --> 01:28:05.237
Just look at you.

01:28:05.238 --> 01:28:07.573
How'd you get here?

01:28:07.699 --> 01:28:09.241
I walked.

01:28:09.242 --> 01:28:10.785
Oh, Lord.

01:28:10.911 --> 01:28:13.621
Well, come on in the house.

01:28:13.747 --> 01:28:15.790
Where'd you start from?

01:28:15.916 --> 01:28:17.917
What do you mean,
you walked?

01:28:29.471 --> 01:28:32.264
How do you boys
get so dirty?

01:28:34.267 --> 01:28:37.269
It's good to have
you home, sweetheart.

01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:41.273
I want this to feel
like home, okay?

01:28:53.787 --> 01:28:56.414
This was your mother's room.

01:29:01.503 --> 01:29:04.171
I kept so many of 'em.

01:29:05.465 --> 01:29:09.093
I hope they
don't make you sad.

01:29:09.219 --> 01:29:11.303
I like looking at 'em.

01:29:13.932 --> 01:29:16.684
Makes me feel like
she's still here.

01:29:18.895 --> 01:29:22.648
You were born in this bed.
This exact one.

01:29:23.984 --> 01:29:25.484
Really?

01:29:29.823 --> 01:29:31.574
See?

01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:34.869
There's your mom and
your dad holding you.

01:29:36.538 --> 01:29:38.914
You were just
a few months old.

01:29:40.751 --> 01:29:44.462
Oh, you've grown
so much since then.

01:29:47.549 --> 01:29:49.341
Oh, my sweet boy.
