- Can I help you?
- Are you the vet?

10:46.291 --> 10:48.125
- I am.
- I have a-a dog in my car.

10:48.125 --> 10:49.250
She s very sick.
I need help.

10:49.250 --> 10:50.458
- Let s get her
to the exam room.

10:50.458 --> 10:52.750
Okay.

10:52.750 --> 10:55.041
Yeah, she s definitely bloated.

10:57.625 --> 11:00.250
He breathing s a bit labored.
What happened?

11:00.250 --> 11:02.834
- Um, she got into
some leftovers.

11:02.834 --> 11:04.875
It was an accident.

11:04.875 --> 11:06.917
She s not even my dog.

11:06.917 --> 11:09.959
I m dog-sitting for work.

11:11.750 --> 11:14.500
- Well, seems that she s
just overeaten.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.750
- So...

11:16.750 --> 11:17.875
she s not sick?

11:17.875 --> 11:20.667
- She gorged herself.

11:20.667 --> 11:23.333
Sometimes dogs this young
don t know when to stop eating,

11:23.333 --> 11:25.750
which is why you need
to measure out their food.

11:25.750 --> 11:28.500
Walking is good for her.
- Gotcha.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.875
Thank you so much.

11:30.875 --> 11:33.041
- Harrison. Curry.

11:33.041 --> 11:36.291
- Kelsey. Drummond.

11:36.291 --> 11:38.291
How much do I owe you
for telling me

11:38.291 --> 11:41.291
that she s
an emotional overeater?

11:41.291 --> 11:42.458
- Why don t you bring her back

11:42.458 --> 11:44.208
so I can give her
a full examination,

11:44.208 --> 11:45.959
make sure everything s okay?

11:45.959 --> 11:47.291
We can settle the bill then.

11:47.291 --> 11:49.125
- It would have to be late.
Like, after work?

11:49.125 --> 11:50.625
- That s fine.

11:50.625 --> 11:51.750
- Sounds good.

11:51.750 --> 11:53.792
Um...

11:53.792 --> 11:55.458
- Okay. I got you.

12:00.250 --> 12:02.291
- I thought that we were going
to figure out a way

12:02.291 --> 12:04.375
to divide our assets evenly.

12:04.375 --> 12:06.583
So far, I am just getting scraps
from the dinner plate.

12:06.583 --> 12:08.166
- Scraps?

12:08.166 --> 12:11.500
Six months out of the year
in Florida is not scraps.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.667
You don t appreciate anything
I ve done for you.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.750
- I love lakes.

12:15.750 --> 12:17.750
- Oh, no, I m not giving you
Jackson Hole.

12:17.750 --> 12:18.875
End of discussion.

12:18.875 --> 12:20.375
- You give me the lake house,

12:20.375 --> 12:22.709
this ends right here,
right now.

12:22.709 --> 12:25.291
- That house is my happy place.

12:25.291 --> 12:26.583
You don t even like to fish.

12:26.583 --> 12:27.583
- Maybe I ll start.

12:27.583 --> 12:31.083
Okay.

12:31.083 --> 12:34.000
If--if I give you Jackson Hole,

12:34.000 --> 12:36.792
you ll agree
to the rest of the terms?

12:36.792 --> 12:38.750
- Yes.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.750
No.

12:47.750 --> 12:48.709
- Ugh!
- Oh.

12:48.709 --> 12:49.709
Come...

12:53.750 --> 12:55.542
- The Ballentines
have six properties

12:55.542 --> 12:57.625
in three countries,
and both of their inheritances

12:57.625 --> 12:59.959
are included
in their assets.

12:59.959 --> 13:01.375
Why don t these people
sign prenups?

13:01.375 --> 13:02.875
- No, no one wants
to think about divorce

13:02.875 --> 13:04.250
before they get married.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.917
It s like acknowledging
the inevitable.

13:06.917 --> 13:09.333
- Houses, cars,
boats, stocks...

13:09.333 --> 13:11.375
These people have more money
and possessions

13:11.375 --> 13:13.083
than I would know
what to do with.

13:13.083 --> 13:15.500
So how s the dog-sitting going?

13:15.500 --> 13:16.875
- Oh, where to start?

13:16.875 --> 13:20.208
Um, Daisy has destroyed
my living room,

13:20.208 --> 13:22.250
and apparently
my most comfortable

13:22.250 --> 13:24.000
pair of shoes
are also the tastiest.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.333
- Mm, that sounds tough.

13:25.333 --> 13:27.583
- Yeah, and dogs are expensive.

13:27.583 --> 13:29.542
I ve already brought her
to the vet for tummy troubles,

13:29.542 --> 13:31.041
and those hours aren t billable.

13:31.041 --> 13:33.583
But Jason gave the task to me,

13:33.583 --> 13:36.917
and I am going to show him
that I am a team player.

13:40.625 --> 13:41.750
Hey.

13:41.750 --> 13:43.208
Did you get the new
Ballentine terms?

13:43.208 --> 13:44.959
- I just finished them.

13:44.959 --> 13:47.291
- No, no. The new-new one.

13:47.291 --> 13:48.583
- What new-new one?

13:48.583 --> 13:50.083
- Came in about 20 minutes ago.

13:50.083 --> 13:52.250
The husband had a suggestion
on our new stock division.

13:52.250 --> 13:53.750
- I ve just been working
on this last set an hour.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.041
- Check your emails.

13:58.041 --> 14:03.041
♪ ♪

14:05.500 --> 14:07.583
- But this is totally different.
When do you need it?

14:07.583 --> 14:09.125
- First thing.
- Jason.

14:09.125 --> 14:10.709
I told Michelle
I d be home for dinner.

14:10.709 --> 14:12.500
- Try the new Spanish diet.

14:12.500 --> 14:13.792
They don t eat
till midnight.

14:13.792 --> 14:14.625
- But it s not a schedule.

14:14.625 --> 14:17.041
It s a...

14:17.041 --> 14:18.458
diet.

14:20.125 --> 14:21.834
- Hey, may I help you?

14:21.834 --> 14:25.250
- Hello, I m Kelsey Drummond.
I m here with Daisy.

14:25.250 --> 14:27.875
- Ah, yes.
We re expecting you.

14:27.875 --> 14:29.583
I m Andre.
- Hi.

14:29.583 --> 14:31.625
- Dr. Curry s just in the back
finishing up on some work.

14:31.625 --> 14:32.875
- Not a worry.

14:32.875 --> 14:33.875
I was just noticing

14:33.875 --> 14:35.834
all of these articles
and awards.

14:35.834 --> 14:38.333
- Yeah, those are all
for Dr. Curry s therapy program.

14:38.333 --> 14:40.667
- Therapy?
- Yeah, he matches patients

14:40.667 --> 14:42.792
with animals to help them
heal and cope

14:42.792 --> 14:45.417
with, well, pretty much
anything that ails them.

14:45.417 --> 14:46.875
- Wow.

14:46.875 --> 14:49.583
- Miss Drummond.
Welcome back.

14:49.583 --> 14:50.625
Hope you haven t
been waiting long.

14:50.625 --> 14:51.625
- Oh, not at all.

14:51.625 --> 14:52.917
I was just admiring

14:52.917 --> 14:55.792
all of your
success stories.

14:55.792 --> 14:57.583
Is that you
with the mayor?

14:57.583 --> 14:59.500
- Oh, yeah.

14:59.500 --> 15:03.834
His brother was a marine
who suffered from PTSD.

15:03.834 --> 15:06.875
Nothing the company of
a Labrador couldn t help with.

15:06.875 --> 15:08.000
Should we head back?
- Yeah, sure.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.375
- All right.

15:09.375 --> 15:12.166
- Come on, Daisy.
- Hey, Daisy.

15:12.166 --> 15:13.542
So is she chipped?

15:13.542 --> 15:14.542
- Chipped?

15:14.542 --> 15:15.667
- Oh, here.

15:18.542 --> 15:20.166
Let s see.

15:23.333 --> 15:24.917
Oh, there it is.

15:24.917 --> 15:27.208
Looks like she has one.

15:27.208 --> 15:29.333
If she ever gets
lost and found,

15:29.333 --> 15:31.834
any shelter can use this
to contact her owner.

15:35.417 --> 15:37.583
Here. Try this.

15:37.583 --> 15:39.792
- Oh. Thanks.

15:39.792 --> 15:41.125
- Mm-hmm.

15:41.125 --> 15:43.208
So how did Daisy
come into your company?

15:43.208 --> 15:45.375
- I have to watch her for work.

15:45.375 --> 15:47.542
I m a divorce mediator.

15:47.542 --> 15:49.542
- A divorce mediator?

15:49.542 --> 15:50.917
I don t know what that is.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.875
- Mediation is how a couple

15:52.875 --> 15:54.417
can legally settle a divorce

15:54.417 --> 15:56.208
without a judge deciding
who gets what.

15:56.208 --> 15:58.125
- And how does Daisy
come into play?

15:58.125 --> 15:59.709
- It s a client s pet.

15:59.709 --> 16:03.792
I was asked to watch her
until a settlement is reached.

16:03.792 --> 16:06.834
I m hoping that it will
impress my boss.

16:06.834 --> 16:09.667
- The old "dog-sitting
to get ahead in work" tactic.

16:09.667 --> 16:11.333
- So the fate of my career

16:11.333 --> 16:13.208
rests on her furry
little shoulders.

16:13.208 --> 16:15.375
- And she looks great.

16:15.375 --> 16:19.875
She s got a great coat,
great teeth.

16:19.875 --> 16:22.417
You are in great shape,
Miss Daisy.

16:22.417 --> 16:23.542
Here we go.

16:27.250 --> 16:28.750
And she hasn t
eaten anything

16:28.750 --> 16:30.250
she s not supposed to,
has she?

16:30.250 --> 16:33.750
- Oh, nothing besides
my shoes and furniture.

16:33.750 --> 16:35.417
- Yeah, you re probably gonna
need to crate train her

16:35.417 --> 16:37.709
for a while since
she s new to your home.

16:37.709 --> 16:39.917
- I don t know how I m gonna get
through the next two months.

16:39.917 --> 16:42.750
- Well, I do help out with

16:42.750 --> 16:45.583
training and care assistance,
if you re interested.

16:45.583 --> 16:47.417
- I am interested.
- Okay.

16:47.417 --> 16:49.250
Well, then I can meet
this weekend.

16:49.250 --> 16:52.250
If you re available.
- I m available.

16:52.250 --> 16:54.417
- Okay.

16:54.417 --> 16:56.875
- Why are these properties
so important to them?

16:56.875 --> 16:58.166
- They re probably not.

16:58.166 --> 16:59.917
They probably just do it
to make the other suffer.

16:59.917 --> 17:02.291
You know how these couples are.
- Yeah.

17:02.291 --> 17:05.375
Well, we ll just have to get
started on the new terms.

17:05.375 --> 17:08.583
- Oh, there is
- the dog.

17:08.583 --> 17:09.791
- Does Mrs. Ballentine
want her

17:09.791 --> 17:11.125
to get the house
in Jackson Hole?

17:11.125 --> 17:14.709
- She just wants to make sure
the dog is fine.

17:14.709 --> 17:16.916
She is doing fine, right?

17:16.916 --> 17:19.959
- Oh, yeah, just tell
Mrs. Ballentine

17:19.959 --> 17:21.834
that she is good and healthy.

17:21.834 --> 17:23.791
- All right, well, she d like
to see for herself.

17:23.791 --> 17:25.416
- What, does she want to make
a house call or something?

17:25.416 --> 17:27.040
You have her information.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.125
Photos and videos
will suffice, so...

17:31.417 --> 17:33.667
All right, let s get back
to these terms.

17:36.250 --> 17:38.125
- Okay.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.792
- Daisy.

17:39.792 --> 17:42.041
You re not so bad.

17:42.041 --> 17:43.959
I don t know what Kelsey s
always complaining about.

17:43.959 --> 17:45.750
You re a good girl.

17:50.291 --> 17:52.500
Oh, my goodness.
What do you think?

17:52.500 --> 17:54.333
Should we talk to him
face-to-face?

17:54.333 --> 17:56.917
I mean webcam-to-webcam?

18:00.000 --> 18:02.792
- Hello. Finally.

18:02.792 --> 18:05.166
Hi, Fireman Randy.

18:05.166 --> 18:06.166
- You know, I got to admit,
you took a while

18:06.166 --> 18:07.375
to answer my video request.

18:07.375 --> 18:08.959
I thought maybe
you weren t interested.

18:08.959 --> 18:10.834
- Uh, no, actually,
you are the first person

18:10.834 --> 18:13.000
that I have ever Lovished.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.166
- So now that we ve spoken,
we should probably meet.

18:16.166 --> 18:17.375
I mean, it s kind of hard

18:17.375 --> 18:19.041
to make a connection
through a screen.

18:19.041 --> 18:21.166
- Uh, yeah.
That--that would be lovely.

18:21.166 --> 18:22.625
How about Thursday night?

18:22.625 --> 18:25.000
- Thursday it is.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.083
I know the perfect spot.

18:26.083 --> 18:27.667
- Great.
Email me when and where.

18:27.667 --> 18:28.709
Bye.

18:31.667 --> 18:32.875
Ah!

18:32.875 --> 18:35.417
♪ I have a date
with a fireman ♪

18:36.917 --> 18:39.041
- So she just keeps going.

18:39.041 --> 18:40.709
Should I stop her?

18:40.709 --> 18:43.542
- This is her walk,
so unless you re in a hurry,

18:43.542 --> 18:47.000
she ll let you know when she
wants to stop, Miss Drummond.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.208
- Okay, for starters,

18:48.208 --> 18:50.333
I appreciate you
sharing your expertise,

18:50.333 --> 18:52.875
but you ve got to stop with
the "Miss Drummond" stuff.

18:52.875 --> 18:55.250
My name is Kelsey.
- Sorry.

18:55.250 --> 18:57.000
All right, all right,
then please,

18:57.000 --> 18:58.333
feel free to call me Harrison.

18:58.333 --> 18:59.750
- Oh, well, I was going to,

18:59.750 --> 19:02.208
because we re peers,
and it s not the 1800s.

19:03.583 --> 19:05.208
- Oh.

19:05.208 --> 19:08.709
- Sorry. Work emails.
- No worries.

19:08.709 --> 19:10.625
- Weekends don t mean much
to my boss.

19:10.625 --> 19:12.291
- Aha, too many broken hearts?

19:12.291 --> 19:14.125
- Most of the time,
our clients

19:14.125 --> 19:16.208
are way past
the broken heart stage.

19:16.208 --> 19:17.959
They re in the, uh,

19:17.959 --> 19:19.834
"How much can I squeeze
out of this?" Phase.

19:19.834 --> 19:21.542
- Ooh, those don t sound
like fun phases.

19:21.542 --> 19:24.083
- No, but...

19:24.083 --> 19:26.041
everyone s got em.

19:26.041 --> 19:27.458
- Well, it seems like
your work has

19:27.458 --> 19:29.041
given you quite the outlook
on relationships.

19:29.041 --> 19:31.208
- Dr. Curry.
Good to see you.

19:31.208 --> 19:33.250
- Oh, hello,
Miss Reed, Scout.

19:33.250 --> 19:34.834
- How have you been?

19:34.834 --> 19:36.500
- Good, good.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.583
I m just here helping out
with some dog training.

19:38.583 --> 19:40.125
- Personal consultation?

19:40.125 --> 19:42.208
I didn t know you did those.

19:42.208 --> 19:43.709
I ll have to make
an appointment.

19:43.709 --> 19:45.500
- Oh, that shouldn t
be necessary.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.500
I don t think Scout
is causing too many problems.

19:50.583 --> 19:51.959
Have a good day.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.208
She s one of my clients.

19:57.208 --> 19:59.083
I was the one who found Scout
for her father.

19:59.083 --> 20:00.583
- Oh, so her father
is another

20:00.583 --> 20:02.291
successful patient
of the program?

20:02.291 --> 20:03.500
- That s right.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.458
- Quite the hero
in these parts.

20:05.458 --> 20:07.041
- I hate that term.

20:07.041 --> 20:09.542
Besides, it s really the animals
who are the heroes.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.250
Isn t that right, Daisy?

20:11.250 --> 20:14.583
They re the ones who are there
for people constantly,

20:14.583 --> 20:18.291
loyal without judgment,
and require nothing in return.

20:18.291 --> 20:19.667
- Except belly rubs
and liver treats.

20:19.667 --> 20:21.083
That s true.

20:21.083 --> 20:22.792
But that s still more
than you can say

20:22.792 --> 20:24.917
for most people, right?

20:24.917 --> 20:26.875
I m sure your work
has shown you that.

20:26.875 --> 20:29.542
- Oh, yes, plenty of times.

20:29.542 --> 20:32.500
- So it would be helpful
to come by your house

20:32.500 --> 20:34.792
just to see how Daisy is
in a home environment.

20:34.792 --> 20:36.875
- Uh, sure.
- Cool.

20:36.875 --> 20:38.709
- Oh, I almost forgot.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.542
- You documenting
the training?

20:43.542 --> 20:45.625
- Uh, it s for the owner.
- Ah.

20:45.625 --> 20:47.542
- Just to let her know
that everything s fine.

20:47.542 --> 20:48.875
- Ah. Yeah, you re fine.

20:48.875 --> 20:50.041
Everything s fine.

20:53.041 --> 20:56.500
♪ ♪

20:56.500 --> 20:58.125
- How long do these
blood tests take?

20:58.125 --> 21:00.417
- They re just making sure
they do it right.

21:00.417 --> 21:02.500
- Sorry for the wait.

21:02.500 --> 21:05.375
- It s fine.

21:05.375 --> 21:06.583
- So what s the news?

21:06.583 --> 21:08.333
Well--

21:08.333 --> 21:11.709
- I m just gonna put that
on vibrate.

21:11.709 --> 21:13.375
- So?

21:13.375 --> 21:16.208
- Well, here are
your blood tests.

21:19.792 --> 21:24.291
It means... you are going
to be parents.

21:24.291 --> 21:25.375
- So it s official?

21:25.375 --> 21:26.792
- Yes, it s official.

21:26.792 --> 21:28.083
Congratulations.

21:28.083 --> 21:29.959
- How far along?

21:29.959 --> 21:31.208
- About five weeks.

21:31.208 --> 21:34.583
- So we should expect
the baby in, like...

21:34.583 --> 21:36.208
- 35 weeks.

21:36.208 --> 21:38.083
Pregnancy lasts
40 weeks, Mitch.

21:38.083 --> 21:39.417
- Yeah, yeah,
I didn t know if you--

21:39.417 --> 21:40.959
I knew that.
I knew that.

21:47.208 --> 21:49.041
Look, I m sorry, work.

21:53.709 --> 21:55.583
- Maintaining
a good home environment

21:55.583 --> 21:58.917
is the most important aspect
of dog ownership.

21:58.917 --> 22:01.417
After all, it is where they
spend the most time.

22:03.834 --> 22:07.375
So you ll just want to secure
and hide any loose wires

22:07.375 --> 22:09.083
or cables that might be
lying around.

22:09.083 --> 22:11.000
Daisy ll want to chew
right through those.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.834
- I ll take care of that
right away.

22:12.834 --> 22:14.583
- And she s not left alone

22:14.583 --> 22:16.250
for too long during the day,
is she?

22:16.250 --> 22:18.375
Like when you re at work
or out?

22:18.375 --> 22:20.750
Dogs don t really like that,
especially at her age.

22:20.750 --> 22:23.333
- Well, when I m at work,
my mom comes by to check on her,

22:23.333 --> 22:26.333
and aside from the office,
I m pretty much always here.

22:26.333 --> 22:27.542
I don t really have
anywhere else to be.

22:29.166 --> 22:31.667
And saying that out loud
makes my life sound very sad.

22:31.667 --> 22:32.917
- No, no, no.

22:32.917 --> 22:34.750
I-I get it.

22:34.750 --> 22:36.458
I m the same way.

22:36.458 --> 22:39.625
I see you have a crate.
That s good.

22:39.625 --> 22:41.959
It ll help keep Daisy
from destroying things at night.

22:43.625 --> 22:46.041
Do you move it to the bedroom
when you go to bed?

22:46.041 --> 22:47.917
- Uh, no.
Should I?

22:47.917 --> 22:49.458
- Definitely.

22:49.458 --> 22:51.125
Dogs are social animals.

22:51.125 --> 22:52.625
They don t like to sleep alone.

22:52.625 --> 22:54.542
- Hmm.

22:54.542 --> 22:55.709
- Well, for the most part,

22:55.709 --> 22:58.458
your home looks
pretty accommodating for a dog.

22:58.458 --> 23:00.583
Just keep your clothes away
if you don t want them chewed on

23:00.583 --> 23:03.291
and make sure any food
is in a safe place.

23:03.291 --> 23:05.125
Wouldn t want another
cobbler incident.

23:05.125 --> 23:07.500
- Okay, that cobbler
would have gone uneaten

23:07.500 --> 23:09.959
if she didn t always
jump on everything.

23:09.959 --> 23:11.208
When can we train that out?

23:11.208 --> 23:12.667
I feel like every time
she sees me,

23:12.667 --> 23:13.834
she wants to jump on me.

23:13.834 --> 23:15.125
- Well, jumping is actually

23:15.125 --> 23:18.166
an instinctive display
of affection from a dog.

23:18.166 --> 23:19.834
When they re puppies,
they learn

23:19.834 --> 23:22.667
to lick their mother s
face and eyes.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.542
That s why Daisy
jumps on you.

23:24.542 --> 23:25.959
She just wants
to lick your face

23:25.959 --> 23:27.792
because she recognizes you
as her mother.

23:27.792 --> 23:29.417
- That actually sounds
kind of sweet.

23:29.417 --> 23:31.458
- Yeah.

23:31.458 --> 23:33.208
- I know she doesn t look
like a handful,

23:33.208 --> 23:36.709
but I wouldn t be able
to handle this without you.

23:36.709 --> 23:40.250
- It s no problem, really.

23:40.250 --> 23:41.458
Should we head
to the bedroom, then?

23:41.458 --> 23:43.917
- What?
- To move the crate in?

23:43.917 --> 23:46.250
- Oh, right. Yeah.

23:48.375 --> 23:50.000
- Lead the way.

23:56.959 --> 23:59.041
- Daisy, come here.

23:59.041 --> 24:02.375
Good girl.
Good girl.

24:02.375 --> 24:04.834
Oh, she s such a good girl.

24:04.834 --> 24:07.667
- Okay.

24:07.667 --> 24:10.875
There you go,
Mrs. Ballentine.

24:12.667 --> 24:15.041
Why does she respond to you
and not me?

24:15.041 --> 24:16.041
- I don t know.

24:16.041 --> 24:17.542
Maybe dogs can sense
conviction.

24:17.542 --> 24:18.750
Go.

24:18.750 --> 24:21.375
- Great, so I m without that?

24:21.375 --> 24:22.750
- What s up?
You look exhausted.

24:22.750 --> 24:25.166
- Just work, long day.

24:25.166 --> 24:26.583
- Well, it s not over yet.

24:26.583 --> 24:28.375
You need to walk Daisy.

24:28.375 --> 24:30.083
- Why can t you?

24:30.083 --> 24:31.500
- Oh, come on.

24:31.500 --> 24:32.834
What, do you think
I dressed this nice

24:32.834 --> 24:34.083
for you and the dog?

24:34.083 --> 24:36.166
- I do not judge
your fashion choices.

24:36.166 --> 24:38.000
- I have a date.
- A date?

24:38.000 --> 24:39.875
- Yes, and I am late enough
already as it is.

24:39.875 --> 24:41.250
Wish me luck.

24:41.250 --> 24:43.083
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

24:48.583 --> 24:52.000
- Well, it looks like we are
taking a walk, Daisy.

24:53.208 --> 24:55.417
- So I m just really nervous.

24:55.417 --> 24:57.792
- Oh, there s nothing
to be nervous about.

24:57.792 --> 24:59.583
- You would think, after so many
years of meeting people,

24:59.583 --> 25:00.792
that it would get easier, but--

25:00.792 --> 25:02.166
- It doesn t get easier,
does it?

25:02.166 --> 25:03.917
- No, no.

25:03.917 --> 25:07.417
Well, guess that s why
I resorted to online dating.

25:07.417 --> 25:09.291
So how about you?

25:09.291 --> 25:11.583
Why did you join
the Lovishness community?

25:13.500 --> 25:16.500
Uh, you know,
I guess I just wanted

25:16.500 --> 25:18.166
to find someone
to connect with.

25:18.166 --> 25:20.625
My husband passed away
about ten years ago,

25:20.625 --> 25:22.583
and, you know,
things were okay

25:22.583 --> 25:23.834
when my daughter
was living at home,

25:23.834 --> 25:25.458
but then she grew up.

25:25.458 --> 25:28.125
She moved out,
you know, and...

25:28.125 --> 25:30.041
I don t know. It just--
it gets hard being alone.

25:30.041 --> 25:31.792
- No, I get it.

25:31.792 --> 25:34.542
As a single father,
when my youngest left the nest,

25:34.542 --> 25:36.625
I honestly didn t know
what I was gonna do.

25:36.625 --> 25:38.000
I would--I actually
caught myself

25:38.000 --> 25:39.917
talking to an empty house.

25:39.917 --> 25:41.792
- Well, at least
you always know

25:41.792 --> 25:43.291
what your response
is gonna be, right?

25:43.291 --> 25:44.667
- Hmm?

25:44.667 --> 25:48.291
- Cause you were just talking
to yourself, so you--

25:48.291 --> 25:49.792
Oh, just forget it.

25:49.792 --> 25:51.417
It was a stupid joke.

25:54.250 --> 25:57.125
Um, so did you, uh--
did you find a way

25:57.125 --> 25:58.667
to help with the loneliness?

25:58.667 --> 26:00.125
- Well, actually,
I got a dalmatian,

26:00.125 --> 26:01.792
and now he s my best friend.

26:01.792 --> 26:03.041
- Come on.
- Yeah.

26:03.041 --> 26:05.250
- A fireman with a dalmatian?

26:05.250 --> 26:06.834
That is funny.

26:06.834 --> 26:08.500
- Why is that funny?

26:08.500 --> 26:11.333
- Well, cause the dalmatian.

26:11.333 --> 26:13.583
It s traditionally
the firehouse dog.

26:13.583 --> 26:15.166
- Right, right.

26:15.166 --> 26:17.834
I never made that connection.

26:22.917 --> 26:24.709
- Easy, girl, easy.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.709
Daisy, no!

26:34.917 --> 26:37.083
Okay, um...

26:38.917 --> 26:41.250
Answer.

26:41.250 --> 26:43.166
- Hi, you ve reached
the voice mail

26:43.166 --> 26:48.208
of Rhonda Drummond,
AKA Rhondagirl at Lovishness.

26:48.208 --> 26:50.375
Leave me a message,
and I ll get back to you

26:50.375 --> 26:52.125
if I find you worthy
of my attention.

26:53.750 --> 26:55.375
- Mom, why aren t you answering?

26:55.375 --> 26:56.375
I need you.

26:56.375 --> 26:58.625
Uh, okay, call me.

26:58.625 --> 26:59.875
Bye.

27:08.709 --> 27:10.542
- Harrison Curry.

27:10.542 --> 27:12.834
- Harrison, uh, it s--
it s Kelsey.

27:12.834 --> 27:14.625
I was walking Daisy
in my neighborhood,

27:14.625 --> 27:17.291
and she got away from me.

27:17.291 --> 27:18.709
I don t know what to do,

27:18.709 --> 27:21.458
and I didn t know
who else to call.

27:21.458 --> 27:23.166
- Well, don t worry.
I will be right over.

27:23.166 --> 27:24.542
I ll meet you at your place.

27:24.542 --> 27:25.542
- Okay, great.

27:25.542 --> 27:27.834
- No problem.

27:32.166 --> 27:35.083
- Shouldn t we go
to the shelter?

27:35.083 --> 27:36.834
Could we track
the microchip?

27:36.834 --> 27:38.709
- Microchip isn t a GPS.

27:38.709 --> 27:40.917
It ll only identify her
once she s found and turned in,

27:40.917 --> 27:43.417
and then they contact
who she s registered to.

27:43.417 --> 27:45.750
- That s the Ballentines.

27:45.750 --> 27:47.333
They can t know
that I ve lost her.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.208
- Hey, don t worry.

27:49.208 --> 27:51.083
We will find her, okay?

27:54.333 --> 27:57.417
- I just know that I ve lost her
and I have messed everything up.

27:57.417 --> 27:59.250
- You make these claims

27:59.250 --> 28:02.458
like you re so confident
with how things will be.

28:02.458 --> 28:03.792
- Is that bad?

28:03.792 --> 28:05.417
- No, no, no. No.

28:05.417 --> 28:07.250
But you can t always know

28:07.250 --> 28:10.166
how things
are gonna turn out.

28:10.166 --> 28:12.709
Like your clients,
none of them got married

28:12.709 --> 28:15.500
knowing it would end
in divorce.

28:15.500 --> 28:17.750
- Trust me, I have seen
plenty of couples

28:17.750 --> 28:19.917
where divorce
was no surprise.

28:19.917 --> 28:21.834
- Okay, maybe that was
a bad example.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.333
What about Daisy?

28:23.333 --> 28:24.834
- What about her?

28:24.834 --> 28:26.500
- Well, you didn t think
you d like Daisy,

28:26.500 --> 28:28.250
but now you re worried sick
about her,

28:28.250 --> 28:30.917
and I don t think
it s just because of work.

28:30.917 --> 28:32.125
- Wait a minute.

28:32.125 --> 28:34.125
We re back at my house.

28:34.125 --> 28:36.083
You took us in a circle?

28:36.083 --> 28:37.709
We re supposed to be looking
for Daisy.

28:37.709 --> 28:39.625
- I was just trying
to give it time.

28:39.625 --> 28:40.583
- Give what time?

28:43.583 --> 28:45.000
Daisy!

28:45.000 --> 28:49.125
Oh, how did you get back here?

28:49.125 --> 28:51.542
Oh, you re such a good girl!

28:51.542 --> 28:52.750
- See?

28:52.750 --> 28:54.250
Most dogs make their way home.

28:54.250 --> 28:56.417
- Thank you.

28:56.417 --> 28:57.875
I really appreciate it.

28:57.875 --> 28:59.000
- No problem.

29:02.458 --> 29:05.542
Uh, we should probably work
on leash training soon,

29:05.542 --> 29:07.125
make sure this doesn t
happen again.

29:07.125 --> 29:08.917
- Sounds good.

29:10.500 --> 29:12.125
Thanks again.

29:12.125 --> 29:13.125
- Night.

29:13.125 --> 29:14.000
- Night.

29:16.709 --> 29:17.792
Come on.

29:17.792 --> 29:19.667
Come on, Daisy.

29:21.375 --> 29:25.000
Okay.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.959
Oh.

29:30.458 --> 29:33.542
Oh, is this cause
you love me, Daisy?

29:33.542 --> 29:35.917
Oh, yeah, that--no,
that s getting a little gross.

29:35.917 --> 29:37.542
- Hey, is everything okay?

29:37.542 --> 29:39.375
I got your calls,
your messages.

29:39.375 --> 29:40.875
Is Daisy okay?

29:40.875 --> 29:42.500

39:29.875 --> 39:31.583

39:31.583 --> 39:34.000
bad dog pun not intended.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.375

to give her back?

39:35.375 --> 39:37.500
- Soon.

39:41.041 --> 39:42.208

39:42.208 --> 39:43.667

39:43.667 --> 39:46.041

to having her around,

39:46.041 --> 39:49.625

pictured myself with a dog.

or something?

40:05.333 --> 40:07.417

40:14.000 --> 40:17.125

the art collection.

41:06.417 --> 41:08.083
Lucy wanted
the postmodern pieces.

41:08.083 --> 41:09.208
Then it started
this whole debate

41:09.208 --> 41:11.583
over what constituted
postmodern.

41:11.583 --> 41:14.000
- It sounds like late nights
freshman year of college.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.208
- Sounds like
your college experience

41:15.208 --> 41:16.500

41:16.500 --> 41:18.542
- Are these two gonna find
common ground on anything?

41:18.542 --> 41:20.250
- I think the only thing
they agree on is divorce.

41:20.250 --> 41:21.709
- What if they haven t
agreed on that?

41:21.709 --> 41:23.041
- What do you mean?

41:23.041 --> 41:24.417

41:30.458 --> 41:33.250
What if Lucy
is turning down every option

41:33.250 --> 41:36.875
because she doesn t
want that to happen?

41:36.875 --> 41:38.792
- So she s unable
to finalize the divorce

41:38.792 --> 41:40.250
cause she doesn t want
to get divorced.

41:40.250 --> 41:42.083

41:42.083 --> 41:44.208
to replace anything they lose.

41:44.208 --> 41:47.041
These physical objects
and properties

41:47.041 --> 41:50.583
are essentially meaningless.

41:50.583 --> 41:52.709
What if the one thing
that Lucy doesn t want to lose

41:52.709 --> 41:53.750

41:59.417 --> 42:01.625
I think the only thing
they have in common is money.

42:01.625 --> 42:05.417
- Well, relationships
don t come from commonality.

42:05.417 --> 42:09.959
There s an unexplainable
and emotional connection,

42:09.959 --> 42:11.667
an understanding.

42:11.667 --> 42:13.291
- Huh, and where did that
come from?

42:16.375 --> 42:17.375
But listen,
whatever the solution,

42:17.375 --> 42:18.709
I hope you find it.

42:50.041 --> 42:52.125

42:52.125 --> 42:53.458
- So it s still going
to be a while

42:53.458 --> 42:55.333
until I get my husband back?

42:55.333 --> 42:57.959
- I don t think you need
to worry about that so much.

42:57.959 --> 43:02.166
Mitch loves you
more than anyone ever.

overworked changes that.

43:08.750 --> 43:10.583
- Sure gets in the way,
though.

43:10.583 --> 43:13.709
- If anyone can get through it,
it s you and Mitch,

43:13.709 --> 43:17.333
and you are gonna make
amazing parents.

43:19.583 --> 43:24.166
Oh, thank you.

Hey, Mom.
- Hey.

43:33.417 --> 43:35.917

for watching Daisy tonight.

43:35.917 --> 43:38.542
- Oh, not a problem.

43:38.542 --> 43:40.750
- I ll try not to have
another late night like this

43:40.750 --> 43:43.458
so you can go on more
Loverly dates

43:43.458 --> 43:45.542
or whatever they re called.

43:45.542 --> 43:48.375
- Yeah, well,
don t worry about it.

43:48.375 --> 43:50.458
I m not sure how much longer
I m willing to try that.

43:50.458 --> 43:51.792
- Why not?

43:51.792 --> 43:53.709
I thought you were
having fun with it.

43:53.709 --> 43:56.709
- Yeah, I mean, it s fun,
but it is so hard

43:56.709 --> 43:59.375
to find compatibility
through computers.

43:59.375 --> 44:01.375
- I thought that s how those
website and apps worked.

44:02.709 --> 44:05.375
Yeah, sweetie, but love does not
come from a checklist.

44:05.375 --> 44:07.542
- That is what everyone
keeps telling me.

44:07.542 --> 44:09.834
- I just want to find someone
I have a connection with.

44:09.834 --> 44:12.083

44:12.083 --> 44:14.333
Flesh and blood

and you know it.

44:16.750 --> 44:18.500
I could not ask
for a better friend,

44:18.500 --> 44:21.166
but you also know that s not
the type I m talking about.

44:21.166 --> 44:23.667

44:23.667 --> 44:25.041
- You know,
I never tell you this,

but, um, one of the main reasons
I have no problem

44:28.417 --> 44:30.000

with Daisy is,

44:30.000 --> 44:34.083
I hate being all alone
in my own place.

44:34.083 --> 44:36.750
- Mom, I didn t know that.

44:36.750 --> 44:40.083
You know that you can
come over here anytime

44:40.083 --> 44:41.542
as long as you call first.

44:41.542 --> 44:44.208

you stick around

44:45.333 --> 44:46.583
and we ll put on a movie?

44:46.583 --> 44:50.208
- Yes.
I will go make popcorn.

44:57.458 --> 44:58.917
- Mrs. Ballentine.

44:58.917 --> 45:00.250
- Ms. Ballentine.

45:00.250 --> 45:02.792
- Of course, Ms. Ballentine.

45:02.792 --> 45:07.166
- Well, I just came from another
unsuccessful meeting,

45:07.166 --> 45:10.500

stop by and ask about Daisy.

45:10.500 --> 45:12.417
The videos you ve been sending
have been great.

45:12.417 --> 45:15.250

enjoyed them,

45:15.250 --> 45:18.125
and Daisy is doing just fine.

45:18.125 --> 45:19.333

45:19.333 --> 45:21.000
- And I know that we ve yet
to come to terms

45:21.000 --> 45:22.458

45:22.458 --> 45:25.834

to comment on your relationship,

45:35.959 --> 45:39.125
but can I ask you something?

45:39.125 --> 45:42.667
- Sure.

45:42.667 --> 45:44.917
- Are you sure that divorce
is right for you?

45:47.166 --> 45:51.792
- I mean, I know that your
relationship seems broken,

45:51.792 --> 45:56.166
but is there a reason you can t
agree on how to end it?

46:01.125 --> 46:03.834
Because maybe
you don t want to?

46:09.208 --> 46:10.709

what I expected

46:10.709 --> 46:12.375

46:12.375 --> 46:17.375

I ve learned a lot recently,

the cat lady club.

to get the beauty

50:58.625 --> 51:00.250

51:00.250 --> 51:03.834

with Daisy

51:03.834 --> 51:06.959
has changed my perspective.
