WEBVTT

00:06.386 --> 00:08.347
What did I miss?

00:09.264 --> 00:11.600
Aunt May, I can't believe
you don't have it on.

00:11.767 --> 00:13.977
They discover alien life
and you're not watching?

00:14.144 --> 00:16.980
Oh, Peter,
aliens are bug-eyed monsters who say:

00:17.147 --> 00:18.732
"Take me to your leader."

00:18.899 --> 00:21.068
This is a mud stain
on the space shuttle.

00:21.235 --> 00:25.781
Not mud. Organic mud. Living mud.
From outer space.

00:25.948 --> 00:30.410
<i>NASA's not releasing images, but if
we zoom in on this shot of the shuttle--</i>

00:30.577 --> 00:36.625
<i>Right there. On the hull.
That dark patch is extraterrestrial life.</i>

00:36.792 --> 00:39.127
<i>Primitive, obviously, but organic.</i>

00:39.294 --> 00:43.090
<i>Earlier today the alien life-form
was flown to Empire State University...</i>

00:43.257 --> 00:47.261
<i>...where it will be studied by
top biogeneticist Dr. Curtis Connors.</i>

00:47.427 --> 00:49.263
Yes! An in.

00:49.429 --> 00:51.431
I hope.

00:52.307 --> 00:55.018
Hello? That's right, bro.

00:55.185 --> 00:59.356
The ooze has landed,
and Dr. C is back in the game.

00:59.523 --> 01:01.942
He's been kind of lost
since the Lizard thing.

01:02.109 --> 01:05.486
Discontinued most of our research,
but we're back in business again.

01:05.654 --> 01:09.825
- I have to see it. Can you hook me up?
- No go, bro. Dr. Martha has spoken.

01:09.992 --> 01:11.827
No visitors, no reporters...

01:11.994 --> 01:15.956
<i>...and for sure no photographers
she already knows she can't trust.</i>

01:16.915 --> 01:20.210
<i>As usual, Peter Parker's out of luck.</i>

01:20.419 --> 01:22.504
<i>But maybe Spider-Man's not.</i>

01:22.671 --> 01:27.801
<i>After all, Spidey's got a zoom lens,
and the lab has a skylight.</i>

01:34.474 --> 01:37.477
<i>And now a peek at our strange visitor.</i>

01:39.521 --> 01:41.523
<i>And our strange visitor's visitor.</i>

02:59.393 --> 03:01.728
A school locker has better security.

03:06.983 --> 03:09.653
Perfect. I stop a crime in progress...

03:09.820 --> 03:13.031
...get pictures for the <i>Bugle</i>
of me and a hot cat burglar...

03:13.198 --> 03:16.660
...and slap my peepers on the ooze.
Hat trick.

03:25.335 --> 03:26.503
Come to kitty.

03:27.587 --> 03:31.091
I never thought I'd be rescuing the icky
alien from the beautiful damsel.

03:31.299 --> 03:34.344
Well, I do believe it's Spider-Man.

03:36.722 --> 03:38.515
Easy, cat lady. I don't want a fight.

03:38.682 --> 03:42.394
Name's Black Cat.
And cats don't fight spiders.

03:44.396 --> 03:46.106
We just bat them around.

04:08.378 --> 04:10.213
Better not get your goop in my hair.

04:10.380 --> 04:12.632
Don't worry.
It comes off with peanut butter.

04:12.799 --> 04:15.635
Lovely. You've got
a sweet little skill-set, there, Spidey.

04:15.802 --> 04:18.137
You want in on this gig?
We could split the take.

04:18.346 --> 04:21.933
Gig? Take?
These words are strange to me.

04:22.100 --> 04:25.604
A certain captain of industry
offered an indecent amount of cash...

04:25.771 --> 04:26.980
...to steal that slime.

04:27.147 --> 04:29.649
Said something about
unlimited scientific potential.

04:29.858 --> 04:31.943
Are you sure
he was a captain of industry...

04:32.110 --> 04:35.071
...and not some industrial cadet
showing off for the girls?

04:36.239 --> 04:38.784
I know when a man's showing off.

04:38.950 --> 04:42.496
So, what do you say, hot stuff?
Want a slice of the mud pie?

04:42.662 --> 04:46.500
It is tempting, but then I'd have to
turn in my superhero discount card.

04:47.292 --> 04:49.461
Too bad. I like us together.

04:49.628 --> 04:52.839
But we only just met.
And I'm not that kind of spider.

04:53.006 --> 04:56.802
Give a cat a chance,
and she'll make you that kind of spider.

04:57.803 --> 05:00.305
Stop, I'm blushing.

05:01.306 --> 05:02.891
- What in the--?
- Dr. Connors.

05:05.143 --> 05:08.480
Two's company,
three's a corroborating witness.

05:08.647 --> 05:12.025
- The life-form. Where is it?
- Black Cat. She must have--

05:12.192 --> 05:14.152
But how? When?

05:14.319 --> 05:16.530
Call the cops. I'll go after her.

05:17.197 --> 05:19.366
So much for this gig.

05:20.700 --> 05:24.162
Bad kitty. Maybe I can still find her.

05:24.329 --> 05:26.832
Heck, I never even got a good look
at the gunk.

05:31.044 --> 05:32.045
Read all about it!

05:33.547 --> 05:36.633
Spider-Thief and accomplice
steal E.T.

05:37.467 --> 05:40.178
And Spider-Man's come in
through the skylight before?

05:40.345 --> 05:42.222
Yes, but never to steal anything.

05:47.352 --> 05:49.688
I actually thought Spidey was a hero.

05:49.855 --> 05:52.148
And I actually thought Pete
was a human being...

05:52.315 --> 05:56.403
...but he was here taking pictures and
couldn't be bothered to call the police.

05:56.570 --> 05:57.988
- But--
- Don't bother, Gwen.

05:58.154 --> 06:02.951
Bro had his second chance. I'm done.

06:06.580 --> 06:07.747
Boss, I'd like a word.

06:07.914 --> 06:11.418
How about "scram"?
Or two words: "Scram, kid." Or 17:

06:11.585 --> 06:15.255
"Get out of my office in 2.3 seconds
or I'll staple you to a flagpole."

06:16.882 --> 06:19.426
How did you count so--?
Never mind.

06:19.593 --> 06:21.761
I can't believe you're printing
flat-out lies.

06:21.928 --> 06:25.265
Lies? You callow, insubordinate pup.

06:25.432 --> 06:27.058
The <i>Bugle</i> only prints facts.

06:27.225 --> 06:29.269
And whatever
it takes to connect the facts.

06:29.436 --> 06:32.105
Yeah, but I was there.
Taking pictures from the roof.

06:32.272 --> 06:35.775
Spidey was trying to stop Black Cat
from stealing the ooze.

06:35.942 --> 06:37.736
They didn't leave together.

06:37.903 --> 06:41.448
Looked that way to an amateur like you,
but it's standard crook behavior.

06:41.615 --> 06:43.283
They met up to divide the spoils.

06:43.450 --> 06:47.245
- Ask Dr. Connors. He was there.
- Last night? Read the article, kid.

06:47.412 --> 06:50.206
Connors didn't discover the theft
till early this morning.

06:50.373 --> 06:51.416
What?

06:51.583 --> 06:54.127
<i>Why would Dr. Connors lie?</i>

06:58.548 --> 07:03.720
Spider-Man must be quite confused
right about now.

07:04.721 --> 07:06.264
Hello, general.

07:06.431 --> 07:10.143
No.
Regretfully, I have no alien to deliver.

07:10.310 --> 07:14.481
A known competitor beat my team
to the lab by mere minutes.

07:14.648 --> 07:21.071
Of course. Your down payment
will be refunded. Goodbye.

07:24.574 --> 07:26.618
- So no paycheck?
- No paycheck.

07:26.785 --> 07:30.830
But this story in the <i>Bugle,</i>
it sparked an epiphany.

07:30.997 --> 07:34.459
Mason,
I'll need all your mechanical ability.

07:37.671 --> 07:40.173
And Beck,
your special-effects expertise.

07:40.340 --> 07:42.008
Yeah, so, what else is new?

07:42.175 --> 07:44.678
Which captain of industry
or high-ranking politico...

07:44.844 --> 07:46.638
...you posing as this time,
Chameleon?

07:46.805 --> 07:51.810
This time I have someone
a little different in mind.

07:56.106 --> 07:58.108
<i>Black Cat must have taken the muck.</i>

07:58.274 --> 08:01.611
<i>There's no proof in any of my pictures,
but I know I didn't take it.</i>

08:01.778 --> 08:03.029
<i>And what's with Dr. C?</i>

08:03.196 --> 08:06.449
<i>Spidey saved him from
a permanent case of lizard breath.</i>

08:06.616 --> 08:09.202
<i>I mean, how could he betray
the old web-head that way?</i>

08:09.369 --> 08:13.707
<i>And how am I ever gonna clear
my friendly neighborhood name?</i>

08:23.633 --> 08:26.386
And the crazy thing?
They think I stole the alien.

08:26.553 --> 08:28.638
I never even got a good look at it.

08:28.805 --> 08:32.267
That's a good look for you.
And I'm flattered, truly.

08:32.433 --> 08:34.727
See? I knew we made a connection.

08:34.894 --> 08:38.023
You. You're the real thief.

08:38.188 --> 08:41.067
Because I stole your heart?
Heard it before, swinger.

08:41.234 --> 08:42.568
What the heck?

08:42.736 --> 08:44.111
I've been looking for you.

08:44.279 --> 08:47.157
I know I don't like being blamed
for crimes I didn't commit.

08:47.323 --> 08:49.576
Or any crimes, really.
Bad for business.

08:49.743 --> 08:54.039
So the frame-up must really annoy
an ex-primary-color guy like you.

08:55.373 --> 08:56.750
Yeah.

08:56.916 --> 08:59.252
You didn't steal the ooze, did you?

08:59.419 --> 09:02.047
You know I didn't,
short, dark and handsome.

09:02.213 --> 09:03.256
You were there.

09:03.423 --> 09:05.717
- So unless you took it...
- I didn't take it.

09:05.884 --> 09:07.969
Calm down. I didn't think so.

09:08.136 --> 09:11.014
But if you're fed up enough
with the thankless hero thing...

09:11.181 --> 09:14.934
...to match your image to mine,
then I have to ask:

09:15.101 --> 09:19.856
Are we going to be bad guys together,
partner? Or just plain bad'?

09:20.982 --> 09:22.776
Was it something I said?

09:23.318 --> 09:24.611
Guess I found the ooze.

09:25.487 --> 09:27.238
Or it found me.

09:27.405 --> 09:31.493
Face it, Spidey, alien life has
permanently bonded itself to your suit.

09:31.659 --> 09:35.997
Best case, you're in for one monster
of a dry-cleaning bill.

09:41.294 --> 09:44.964
Perfect, now I'm flying a glider.
Gotta ditch in Central Park.

09:48.593 --> 09:52.680
No. Eddie and I lost our parents
in a plane just like that.

09:54.641 --> 09:56.392
Can't believe I made that leap.

09:57.227 --> 09:59.646
I hope I'm strong enough for this.

10:07.654 --> 10:10.949
Trouble is, I'm not close enough
to a building for my web to carry.

10:11.116 --> 10:13.868
Still. Nothing to lose.

10:18.456 --> 10:21.084
Oh, slick! Did I do that?

10:21.251 --> 10:25.421
Or did the ooze actually upgrade
my spider-ness?

10:29.342 --> 10:30.802
- Look out!
- Run!

10:39.477 --> 10:42.897
<i>If I can use the ooze
to help more people as Spider-Man...</i>

10:44.649 --> 10:47.819
<i>...and not incidentally earn
more photo money as Peter Parker...</i>

10:48.862 --> 10:53.700
<i>...then maybe it's okay that I sort of
unintentionally stole the slime...</i>

10:53.867 --> 10:55.160
<i>...from the Connors' lab.</i>

10:55.326 --> 10:59.330
<i>And maybe it's better for everyone
if I don't return it.</i>

10:59.497 --> 11:02.750
<i>Course, that's not really my call.</i>

11:04.252 --> 11:06.754
<i>But obviously it was the right call.</i>

11:11.009 --> 11:13.761
<i>Yeah, I could get used to this.</i>

11:13.928 --> 11:16.097
Hey, Aunt May.

11:16.764 --> 11:20.101
- Aunt May, what's wrong?
- Oh, Peter. I'm sorry.

11:20.268 --> 11:24.272
I didn't mean to frighten you.
It was just the heat from the stove.

11:24.439 --> 11:26.357
And I am a little tired.

11:26.524 --> 11:29.736
I'm not surprised.
You've been cooking nonstop.

11:29.903 --> 11:31.988
There's enough food here
to feed the Rhino.

11:32.197 --> 11:36.409
I'm testing recipes.
We can give the extra to the food drive.

11:36.576 --> 11:39.287
Come on, let's get you to bed.

11:53.426 --> 11:56.387
Spider-Man just robbed the bank!

12:01.142 --> 12:02.185
Cut it out!

12:02.352 --> 12:06.814
What's the matter, Flashie?
Does the truth hurt?

12:07.023 --> 12:10.026
It's not the truth.
I mean, it's not true.

12:10.193 --> 12:12.362
If it's Make-Fun-of-Flash Day,
how can I help?

12:12.528 --> 12:16.574
Little Flashie's mad because his hero
turned out to be a big crook.

12:16.783 --> 12:18.910
The guy in the pictures
ain't the real Spidey.

12:20.370 --> 12:23.748
Any guy can put on a costume.
Puny Parker wore one last week.

12:23.915 --> 12:26.584
Can Puny Parker
stick to walls and sling webs?

12:26.793 --> 12:30.255
Face it, Flash. The <i>Bugle</i>
has undeniable photographic evidence.

12:30.421 --> 12:31.464
<i>Forget the Bugle!</i>

12:31.631 --> 12:34.842
There's no way I'm ever gonna believe
Spider-Man's turned to crime.

12:35.009 --> 12:37.804
Then you're the only one.

12:40.056 --> 12:42.809
No sudden moves, friends.

12:44.727 --> 12:48.231
Your friendly neighborhood
web-shooter's in a frisky mood.

12:49.816 --> 12:50.817
Behind you.

12:50.984 --> 12:53.653
My insect early-warning system's
tingling.

13:08.835 --> 13:10.837
Fill her up.

13:16.175 --> 13:19.595
Wonderful. Perfect.
Tomorrow's front page.

13:19.762 --> 13:22.932
- Mr. Jameson, these pictures--
- Too late, Parker.

13:23.099 --> 13:24.892
Got all the pictures I could ask for.

13:25.059 --> 13:27.520
Joe Anonymous
is letting me have them for free.

13:27.687 --> 13:30.064
As I predicted,
the web-head's turned out to be...

13:30.231 --> 13:31.733
...just another thug in a mask.

13:31.899 --> 13:34.485
Soon he'll be caught, jailed
and run out of town.

13:34.652 --> 13:37.572
How can he be jailed
and run out of town?

13:38.531 --> 13:41.367
I'm giddy as a schoolgirl.

13:44.620 --> 13:47.665
<i>Never thought I'd be on the lookout
for, well, me.</i>

13:47.874 --> 13:51.419
Hey, crime spree. Was hoping
you'd swing this way again.

13:51.586 --> 13:54.505
- Cat. Listen, I'm innocent.
- Obviously.

13:54.672 --> 13:57.592
Doesn't that imposter know
black is the new red and blue?

13:57.759 --> 14:00.928
Yeah, I'd turn him black and blue,
if I could find him.

14:01.387 --> 14:03.181
Well, as it happens...

14:28.748 --> 14:30.666
How can you be so sure
he'll hit here?

14:30.833 --> 14:32.168
I think like a thief.

14:32.335 --> 14:35.797
A boat full of overdressed fat cats
is a can't-miss proposition.

14:36.422 --> 14:38.007
Wait.

14:39.759 --> 14:43.096
Mayor Waters is wearing
the Stuyvesant Tiger.

14:43.304 --> 14:44.555
I want it.

14:44.722 --> 14:47.058
Cat, no door prizes.

14:48.851 --> 14:50.770
Try focusing
on how we get aboard.

14:50.937 --> 14:54.816
Please, I'm a professional.
I come prepared.

14:55.024 --> 14:57.151
Hello, so glad you could make it.

14:57.318 --> 14:59.445
I'm wearing a fortune
in borrowed jewels.

14:59.612 --> 15:03.366
Let's get moving before a certain
arachnid decides to crash my party.

15:03.533 --> 15:06.536
I don't buy it, Your Honor.
I've seen Spider-Man in action.

15:06.702 --> 15:09.539
- I can't believe he's turned to crime.
- Believe it, Stacy.

15:09.705 --> 15:12.375
The Bugle's been saying for weeks
the web-head's a fraud.

15:12.542 --> 15:16.546
Now that I'm proven right, I assume
you've taken the proper precautions.

15:16.712 --> 15:21.592
Don't worry, Jonah. My officers
are all on alert for Spider-Man.

15:21.801 --> 15:25.972
Besides, if he was coming,
he's too late now.

15:33.980 --> 15:35.481
<i>Hots d' oeuvres, Your Honor'?</i>

15:35.648 --> 15:39.026
Norman. Wonderful of you to come.

15:39.193 --> 15:42.196
Are you happy to see me
or my contribution?

15:42.363 --> 15:44.490
And if my answer is both?

15:44.657 --> 15:47.243
Then I'm investing
in an honest politician.

15:47.410 --> 15:49.829
Now, if you'll excuse me...

16:06.804 --> 16:08.723
Demitasse, sergeant?

16:11.017 --> 16:14.020
- Sweet ride.
- Haven't you heard? Crime pays.

16:14.187 --> 16:16.564
I'm not listening.

16:18.566 --> 16:22.153
- Almost there. Hold on tight.
- Don't worry, I don't slip.

16:22.320 --> 16:24.197
Not why I said that.

16:25.156 --> 16:27.325
We're-- We're close enough.

16:28.576 --> 16:30.578
My kitty sense is purring.

16:35.958 --> 16:38.044
<i>Guess Cat was right.</i>

16:38.628 --> 16:43.966
And so I raise my glass
to thank you for all your support.

16:44.133 --> 16:50.556
And after the election,
your city will thank you too.

16:50.848 --> 16:54.477
As will your friendly
neighborhood Spider-Thief.

16:55.061 --> 16:56.771
I knew it.

17:00.900 --> 17:02.860
- Fill them up, folks.
- Take him.

17:14.247 --> 17:18.792
Your Honor,
if you hold that Tiger too tight, I bite.

17:21.420 --> 17:24.339
He's too tall. This guy's a fraud.

17:24.507 --> 17:27.843
Spider-Man is not a fraud.
Can't believe I just said that.

17:28.426 --> 17:29.679
Behind you.

17:33.432 --> 17:36.811
That's spider-strength, people.
Think I can fake that?

17:36.978 --> 17:39.355
Actually, I do.

17:39.522 --> 17:43.025
- And who are you supposed to be?
- Spider-Man. The real one.

17:43.192 --> 17:46.153
The real one? You don't even have
the costume right.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.781
I'm in mourning for my buried rep.

17:51.284 --> 17:54.370
Like pickle-puss will be
when he's forced to print a retraction.

17:54.537 --> 17:57.456
Retraction'? Listen, web-head,
nobody tells J. Jonah--

17:57.623 --> 18:01.460
See? Even the jolly one himself
knows I'm the genuine article.

18:12.972 --> 18:16.267
Now, that's spider-strength.
Accept no substitutes.

18:16.434 --> 18:18.144
Demitasse, Spider-Man?

18:20.313 --> 18:22.857
They took the Tiger.

18:23.858 --> 18:25.818
Yeah, we need to go.

18:31.073 --> 18:32.158
Incoming.

18:57.475 --> 19:01.187
We'll let them settle this
Spider-Man to Spider-Man.

19:03.522 --> 19:06.192
- Thanks, Cat, I owe you one.
- At least.

19:12.698 --> 19:14.950
<i>Wow, the new onesie.</i>

19:15.117 --> 19:16.911
<i>I can feel it balancing me.</i>

19:17.078 --> 19:20.039
<i>Compensating for the boat,
the water, everything.</i>

20:37.825 --> 20:40.661
How about a taste
of spider-punch?

20:40.828 --> 20:42.621
Tell me I don't sound like that.

20:42.788 --> 20:45.791
Or at least that I offer
a higher-quality quip.

20:56.469 --> 20:58.763
The one and only. Got it.

20:58.929 --> 21:01.557
My hero.

21:04.810 --> 21:06.854
You heard me, a retraction.

21:07.021 --> 21:10.483
But on Page 42, in 4-point font.

21:12.193 --> 21:14.403
I'm satisfied you're innocent,
Spider-Man.

21:14.570 --> 21:17.031
We'll find out what Chameleon did
with the E.T.

21:17.198 --> 21:18.199
Actually, I sort of--

21:18.365 --> 21:19.366
<i>What are you doing?</i>

21:19.533 --> 21:21.577
<i>You tell the truth
and they'll take the suit.</i>

21:21.744 --> 21:25.164
<i>You need its power to help people.</i>

21:25.748 --> 21:28.125
I sort of figured you'd say that.

21:28.334 --> 21:30.002
Then I'll say this too:

21:30.169 --> 21:33.756
As long as you wear a mask,
some folks will always wonder.

21:33.923 --> 21:37.968
- Night, captain.
- Captain Stacy. The Tiger. It's not here.

21:38.135 --> 21:40.262
All right, Chameleon, where's--?

21:53.400 --> 21:56.487
We made a pretty good team.
Maybe you should change sides.

21:57.780 --> 22:00.032
Okay, then why did you help me?

22:00.199 --> 22:01.659
You really don't know?

22:15.506 --> 22:21.804
Wow, Cat.
I had no idea you felt that way.

22:22.304 --> 22:23.556
Cat?

22:23.722 --> 22:26.392
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
