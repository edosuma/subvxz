<i>Hinazuki was absent.</i>

00:17.642 --> 00:18.893
<i>I have a bad feeling.</i>

00:28.778 --> 00:31.448
Hinazuki! Is someone here?!
Hinazuki!

01:13.740 --> 01:16.618
<i>March 3rd, 1988.</i>

01:18.828 --> 01:19.954
<i>Kayo Hinazuki...</i>

01:21.081 --> 01:22.373
<i>went missing.</i>

01:37.764 --> 01:38.598
MARCH 7TH (MONDAY)

01:38.681 --> 01:39.724
Kayo moved to Sapporo

01:39.808 --> 01:42.519
to live with her grandmother
for family reasons.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.729
She's sorry she couldn't say goodbye.

01:45.647 --> 01:49.734
I know you may all be sad, but Kayo
is happy in Sapporo, doing her best.

01:49.818 --> 01:52.612
So, there's no reason
for anyone to feel too sad.

02:56.342 --> 02:59.429
<i>Hinazuki and I weren't able</i>
<i>to keep the last promise...</i>

03:00.889 --> 03:02.181
<i>we made to each other.</i>

03:13.651 --> 03:14.652
I'm home.

03:28.416 --> 03:29.250
Satoru?

03:34.797 --> 03:37.258
I understand you're worried about Kayo...

03:38.176 --> 03:40.178
but it's not your fault she's gone.

03:42.055 --> 03:42.889
I...

03:44.432 --> 03:46.267
I couldn't do anything for her.

03:47.852 --> 03:49.062
There had to be more.

03:50.188 --> 03:52.232
More I could've done for her.

03:59.155 --> 04:01.449
There's only so much one person can do.

04:02.450 --> 04:05.662
It's conceited of you
to blame yourself afterwards.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.335
Now, come on, let's eat.

04:37.360 --> 04:41.406
I didn't expect a second child
to go missing so soon.

04:46.744 --> 04:48.830
WE ARE LOOKING FOR AYA NAKANISHI

04:49.414 --> 04:52.208

04:56.963 --> 04:58.214
<i>I was overwhelmed...</i>

04:59.257 --> 05:00.883
<i>by a sense of helplessness.</i>

05:28.161 --> 05:29.078
Bye!

06:22.215 --> 06:26.219
KAYO HINAZUKI

06:30.848 --> 06:33.142
<i>It's been a week</i>
<i>since her disappearance.</i>

06:34.018 --> 06:36.229
<i>It's not even clear if she's dead yet.</i>

06:43.236 --> 06:45.404
<i>Sorry, Fujinuma...</i>

06:45.988 --> 06:49.492
I couldn't make your present in time.

06:50.326 --> 06:52.787
-I'll give you your present tomorrow.
-Okay.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.205
I promise.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.027
Where am I?

07:33.453 --> 07:35.663
I'm back in 2006?

08:09.572 --> 08:10.990
<i>I didn't do enough.</i>

08:12.283 --> 08:15.661
<i>A ten-year-old child</i>
<i>with little knowledge and experience.</i>

08:19.165 --> 08:21.042
<i>I should've realized that</i>

08:21.125 --> 08:24.003
<i>and tackled the case</i>
<i>as if my life depended on it.</i>

08:28.382 --> 08:29.926
It's already come to this.

08:32.428 --> 08:33.721
<i>Should I step out now</i>

08:34.179 --> 08:35.556
<i>and tell them the truth?</i>

08:39.434 --> 08:40.352
Hold on.

08:41.145 --> 08:44.649
Black hair, 5 feet, 11 inches tall,
thin, white shirt.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.067
Got it.

08:46.150 --> 08:48.152
-What about the rent?
-Paid on time.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.154
-That right?
-That's right, yes.

08:50.738 --> 08:51.572
<i>No.</i>

08:52.156 --> 08:55.326
<i>Nobody's going to believe me,</i>
<i>let alone the police.</i>

08:56.410 --> 08:59.664
<i>In that case...</i>
<i>I have to find the killer myself.</i>

09:10.633 --> 09:14.679
You stupid? You can't leave your phone on.

09:16.305 --> 09:19.559
They'll track you down with GPS.

09:20.309 --> 09:21.435
Airi.

09:22.770 --> 09:24.564
You called me by my first name.

09:27.066 --> 09:28.943
Are you all right?

09:29.694 --> 09:30.778
Here.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.405
Satoru.

09:33.239 --> 09:36.534
I live close by.
Why don't you come with me?

09:39.036 --> 09:40.246
Okay?

09:46.210 --> 09:47.712
Sorry, wait here a second.

09:56.762 --> 09:57.930
Have a seat!

09:59.098 --> 10:00.766
Don't worry, I live alone.

10:02.393 --> 10:05.187
-Okay.
-Make yourself comfortable.

10:12.653 --> 10:16.407
I moved from the country
because there's a school I want to go to.

10:16.490 --> 10:18.451
My aunt owns this property.

10:19.243 --> 10:21.245
Oh, I see.

10:29.837 --> 10:31.756
Are you sure about letting me in?

10:32.590 --> 10:35.968
Judging by how you acted,
you know about the murder, don't you? Yeah. The police came to the restaurant
asking about you.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.892
-And it's on the news.
-Then why?

10:44.852 --> 10:46.479
Isn't it obvious?

10:46.812 --> 10:49.482
Because there's no way
you killed your mother.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.448
Thank you.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.328
By the way.

11:03.537 --> 11:05.331
You forgot this.

JAPAN UNDERGROUND
BIG CRIMES FROM THE SHOWA PERIOD

11:14.840 --> 11:16.300
I have something of yours!

11:16.384 --> 11:20.388
<i>I thought she handed me this book then.</i>

11:20.721 --> 11:24.100
In any case,
it seems like trouble always finds you.

11:25.267 --> 11:29.021
Like Kayo Hinazuki's murder
on the day of the Hina Festival.

11:30.064 --> 11:32.191
That was your hometown, wasn't it?

11:32.775 --> 11:33.984
On the Hina Festival?

11:36.529 --> 11:37.863
I cried when I read it.

11:42.201 --> 11:44.286
Oh, I bet you're hungry!

11:44.954 --> 11:47.164
I'll go out and get you something.

11:57.758 --> 11:58.592
MARCH 3RD

11:58.676 --> 12:00.136
The book's changed.

12:02.096 --> 12:03.973
Was I able to change the past?

12:09.895 --> 12:11.313
I was able to change it.

12:17.653 --> 12:20.322
I'm back.

12:45.681 --> 12:49.185
How can they go after him
when he's the one in the most pain?

12:50.019 --> 12:51.437
It's so unfair.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.240
<i>In Funabashi City, Chiba,</i>

13:03.324 --> 13:06.827
<i>a 52-year-old woman was stabbed to death</i>

13:06.911 --> 13:09.455
<i>and the police are treating it</i>
<i>as a murder.</i>

13:09.538 --> 13:12.500
<i>They are currently searching</i>
<i>for the victim's son,</i>

13:12.583 --> 13:15.127
<i>Satoru Fujinuma,</i>
<i>in connection to her murder.</i>

13:15.711 --> 13:18.547
<i>The incident took place</i>
<i>last night around 6 p.m.</i>

13:18.839 --> 13:21.050
<i>In an apartment in Funabashi, Chiba,</i>

13:21.133 --> 13:24.512
<i>a female was discovered dead</i>
<i>having been stabbed by a knife.</i>

<i>and her son, Satoru Fujinuma,</i>
<i>who was also living in the apartment,</i>

<i>has not been seen since the incident.</i>

<i>The key phrases for my mother's killer</i>
<i>are "kidnapping"</i>

15:08.574 --> 15:10.576
<i>and "a man between 20 to 50."</i>

15:18.626 --> 15:20.753
Three years ago in the city...

15:20.836 --> 15:22.504
A young girl was kidnapped.

15:23.797 --> 15:26.800
<i>I want to look into it.</i>
<i>It's dangerous,</i>

15:27.259 --> 15:29.970
<i>but as more time passes,</i>
<i>my options get limited.</i>

15:30.679 --> 15:32.973
<i>The sooner I do something, the better.</i>

15:36.644 --> 15:39.480
Thank you so much, Mr. Nishizono.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.899
My father...

15:42.232 --> 15:46.195
he can't believe how much business
can change with a single crosswalk.

15:46.278 --> 15:47.821
He was very grateful.

15:48.697 --> 15:51.367
Your father's always been so good to me.

15:52.618 --> 15:56.622
And besides, the city council
already discussed the location.

15:56.956 --> 15:57.790
Boss.

15:58.707 --> 16:01.710
Excuse me.
Katagiri is heading off for the day.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.672
Don't tell me you paid for a pizza
again?

16:05.047 --> 16:08.884
-You could've taken it for free.
-I didn't want any special favors.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.345
Well, I should be going now.

16:13.639 --> 16:18.435
That Ms. Katagiri, she's very responsible
for a kid in this day and age.

16:18.978 --> 16:22.606
She may only be 17, but she's got
a good head on her shoulders.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.957
What is it, boss?

16:40.833 --> 16:43.794
Here. You forgot it comes with
a free pizza.

16:46.505 --> 16:49.383
-Thank you. You didn't have to do this.
-It's fine.

16:49.925 --> 16:52.678
So, about Satoru...

16:53.345 --> 16:54.179
Yes?

16:54.513 --> 16:58.350
I still don't believe Satoru
would do something like that.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.686
I completely agree!

17:00.769 --> 17:03.480
If you happen to run into him,

17:03.564 --> 17:04.857
please help him out.

17:05.566 --> 17:08.402
If you do, give me a call
and I'll do what I can.

17:08.484 --> 17:09.319
Okay!

17:09.403 --> 17:11.280
I'll tell him that if I see him.

17:11.905 --> 17:13.615
Well, bye, then.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.604
<i>At his first hearing,</i>

17:43.937 --> 17:46.648
<i>the defendant was sentenced</i>
<i>to life in prison,</i>

<i>but he maintained his innocence.</i>

17:52.362 --> 17:54.114
<i>Something doesn't feel right.</i>

18:18.055 --> 18:19.473
Detective Watanabe?

18:21.725 --> 18:23.602
What were you going to tell him?

18:23.685 --> 18:26.021
Look, I'm just worried about you.

18:26.688 --> 18:28.649
Satoru's been accused of murder--

18:29.274 --> 18:31.985
Then why didn't you just say so
from the start?!

18:32.986 --> 18:34.655
You told me to help Satoru.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.032
You said you'd help, too!

18:45.999 --> 18:48.752
I wanted to trust you...

18:55.509 --> 18:56.718
I'm sorry, Satoru.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.763
My room isn't safe anymore.

19:00.514 --> 19:01.807
Our boss found out.

19:03.350 --> 19:04.184
No, it's okay.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.770
You helped me get
some much needed rest.

19:08.564 --> 19:09.398
Thank you.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.529
Can I ask you something?

19:16.989 --> 19:20.242
How can you trust me so much?

19:22.828 --> 19:26.957
It's not because I can trust you...
it's because I want to trust you.

19:29.376 --> 19:31.795
I want to trust you for myself.

19:32.713 --> 19:35.591
It's because I want others
to trust me in return.

19:40.971 --> 19:42.472
That's good enough for me.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.852
You should go back to the house.

19:46.935 --> 19:49.396
Tell the police
I threatened you to hide me.

19:49.479 --> 19:51.857
You stupid?! I'd never say that.

19:53.734 --> 19:56.028
Besides, you can't get away on your own.

19:56.904 --> 19:57.905
But...

19:58.488 --> 20:00.782
Let me just get you some money, then.

20:05.329 --> 20:08.373
Here, speed dial one is my landline.

20:08.832 --> 20:10.542
Call me if something happens.

20:16.715 --> 20:17.591
Thanks.

20:19.801 --> 20:22.429
Okay, I'll be right back.
Please wait for me.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.461
It's not much, but it should help, right?

21:07.432 --> 21:10.727

Is this enough?

A blackout?

What? What was that?

22:23.842 --> 22:24.926
Who's there?!

23:33.745 --> 23:34.913
Airi!

Airi...

Airi!

24:01.731 --> 24:02.899
Airi!

24:04.943 --> 24:05.861
Don't move her!

24:07.821 --> 24:10.532
We have to keep her still
and call an ambulance.

24:10.615 --> 24:12.534
Satoru, go. Leave this to me.

24:12.617 --> 24:14.578
-But--
-You involved Airi enough!

24:24.254 --> 24:25.088
Hello?

24:25.922 --> 24:29.050
A girl fell from the second floor.

24:29.634 --> 24:30.677
She's unconscious.

24:52.532 --> 24:54.993
<i>The killer even knew where Airi lived.</i>

24:56.870 --> 24:57.787
<i>He followed her.</i>

24:59.331 --> 25:02.459
<i>He's a lot closer than I imagined.</i>
