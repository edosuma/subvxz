10:13.362 --> 10:14.947
Grover will need
a little time to, uh,

10:14.989 --> 10:16.824
find another arrangement.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.784
End of the week.

10:18.826 --> 10:21.579
But either the pooch goes,
or you both go.

10:26.083 --> 10:28.169
Good luck.

10:29.670 --> 10:31.339
If you say "I told you so,"

10:31.380 --> 10:33.466
I swear to something holy
you'll be wearing this drink.

10:33.507 --> 10:35.468
You going out
with a reporter...

10:35.509 --> 10:37.386
Would be a lot
less problematic

10:37.428 --> 10:39.847
if I didn't have
a father/fugitive

10:39.889 --> 10:41.891
using Greylock as
a vacation rental.

10:41.932 --> 10:43.225
Do you regret it?

10:43.267 --> 10:45.895
Do you wish you hadn't
let me stay?

10:45.936 --> 10:48.230
(sighs)

10:48.272 --> 10:50.816
I thought somehow that
leaking the documents

10:50.858 --> 10:52.485
was gonna do the trick.

10:52.526 --> 10:54.195
The bad guys would
get arrested,

10:54.236 --> 10:58.032
and I could quit
being Deep Throat.

10:58.074 --> 11:01.118
But, um...

11:01.160 --> 11:04.538
maybe the only real way
to stop building things

11:04.580 --> 11:06.540
is if I come forward myself.

11:06.582 --> 11:08.459
As his girlfriend,

11:08.501 --> 11:11.003
I hate that he's doing this--

11:11.045 --> 11:13.005
putting me in this position,
putting you in this position.

11:13.047 --> 11:16.509
But... he's right.

11:16.550 --> 11:18.678
An article will make
what you did bigger,

11:18.719 --> 11:21.097
and it will help save lives.

11:21.138 --> 11:23.808
The only thing I'd ask is you
let me tell your brother myself.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.726
You know?

11:25.768 --> 11:27.311
If he's gonna find out
I'm a criminal,

11:27.353 --> 11:29.605
I would just as soon
he heard it from me.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.524
You're not a criminal.

11:31.565 --> 11:33.442
You're an outlaw.
It's way cooler.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.949
How are you feeling
about going to

11:39.990 --> 11:41.450
your mother's parole hearing?

11:41.492 --> 11:46.038
Um... I don't know.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.833
Listen, Maya,

11:48.874 --> 11:50.584
I'd never tell you
not to help your mom.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.378
I hope you know that.

11:52.420 --> 11:55.423
But you've been through a lot
since you got to Greylock,

11:55.464 --> 11:58.843
and it's okay if this hearing
feels like it's too much.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.469
Okay, but me showing up,

12:00.511 --> 12:02.972
that could make
a really big difference, right?

12:03.013 --> 12:04.473
Your mother getting paroled
depends on

12:04.515 --> 12:05.933
a bunch of different things.

12:05.975 --> 12:08.352
Her behavior in prison.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.689
Her progress in drug rehab.

12:11.731 --> 12:15.025
This isn't all on you, Maya.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.236
I don't know,
I'm just really scared

12:17.278 --> 12:18.779
that I'm gonna say
the wrong thing.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.823
Come here, come here.

12:26.370 --> 12:28.080
I saw that.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.999
What are you doing
down here anyway?

12:30.040 --> 12:32.418
Shouldn't you be upstairs
with Clark Kent?

12:32.460 --> 12:35.713
Mm, I'm kind of avoiding him
at the moment.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.007
Ooh, trouble in Smallville?

12:38.048 --> 12:40.593
Weston figured out that
in addition to a vast

12:40.634 --> 12:44.013
coltan deposit and astounding
natural beauty,

12:44.054 --> 12:47.933
Greylock also boasts a fugitive
by the name of Paul Cooper,

12:47.975 --> 12:49.727
and being a journalist...

12:49.769 --> 12:51.312
That man is about to
snitch on your father,

12:51.353 --> 12:52.563
and he's still in your bed?

12:55.900 --> 12:58.152
I don't want Paul rotting
in federal prison.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.613
I don't want the U.S.
rolling tanks down Main Street

13:00.654 --> 13:02.698
so they can
take him there,

13:02.740 --> 13:03.783
but I'm not stupid.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.201
He can't stay in hiding forever.

13:05.242 --> 13:07.661
The story's gonna
come out eventually.

13:07.703 --> 13:10.873
It's better that it's written
by someone sympathetic. Right?

13:10.915 --> 13:12.291
If you believe that,
then why are you hiding

13:12.333 --> 13:13.793
from your boyfriend
in the kitchen?

13:13.834 --> 13:15.753
Because he's about
to snitch on my father.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.422
(door opens)

13:20.049 --> 13:22.134
(crying):
Hi.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.637
I told Adam that I didn't know
why it happened.

13:24.678 --> 13:27.890
It just did, and that's...

13:27.932 --> 13:29.558
that's not enough for him.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.394
Probably just wondering
if that's the whole truth.

13:32.436 --> 13:34.605
Do you think I wanted to
set my life on fire like this?

13:34.647 --> 13:38.526
No. But I was on the other side
of one of these, remember?

13:38.567 --> 13:42.196
Yes, but what--
You and Alexis is, it's,

13:42.238 --> 13:44.824
that's totally different
than me and Adam.

13:44.865 --> 13:46.826
Is it?

13:46.867 --> 13:50.663
I know I'm irresistible,

13:50.704 --> 13:52.289
but I also know
that wasn't

13:52.331 --> 13:54.083
the only reason Alexis
was sleeping with me.

13:54.124 --> 13:55.626
There were things
in her marriage

13:55.668 --> 13:58.254
she just wasn't dealing with,
and I was the escape.

13:58.295 --> 14:01.048
So the question is,
the night at Town Hall,

14:01.090 --> 14:03.175
what were you escaping?

14:03.217 --> 14:06.804
She wasn't escaping anything.
It was just a mistake.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.055
She loves Adam.

14:08.097 --> 14:09.890
What about Danny?
What about him?

14:09.932 --> 14:11.725
AJ, come on, you know she
isn't still in love with Danny.

14:11.767 --> 14:13.352
I am still in love with Danny.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.730
But I love Adam, too.

14:16.772 --> 14:18.190
(sobs)

14:20.609 --> 14:22.194
What have I done?

14:22.236 --> 14:23.195
(crying)

14:23.237 --> 14:25.698
♪ This is just for you ♪

14:27.032 --> 14:28.784
♪ Could I wear your dress
sometimes? ♪

14:28.826 --> 14:31.161
(bird chirping)

14:34.081 --> 14:36.375
Are you kidding me, Sarah?

14:36.417 --> 14:39.503
Oh. Father of the Year
told you his news?

14:39.545 --> 14:42.089
Why didn't you tell me
Dad was a fugitive?

14:43.799 --> 14:45.593
I was trying to protect you.
(laughs bitterly)

14:45.634 --> 14:47.344
From what?

14:47.386 --> 14:49.847
From the fact that Paul was
lying about why he's here.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.307
He said he was here 'cause
he wanted to be a family again.

14:51.348 --> 14:53.142
He was just trying
to cover his own ass.

14:53.183 --> 14:55.436
I don't need saving. Okay?

14:55.477 --> 14:57.229
I didn't tell you.
I'm sorry.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.815
I'll put on the appropriate
hair shirt when I get home.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.237
I'm really busy, Danny.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.614
I don't know if you noticed,

15:06.655 --> 15:08.157
but half our town
was underwater last week.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.825
The Glenn is gone,

15:09.867 --> 15:11.243
the clinic and the high school
are still off-line,

15:11.285 --> 15:12.828
the West Basin is sopping wet.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.997
And since we still don't
have official recognition,

15:15.039 --> 15:17.124
the only people who can fix
all of this for us, is us.

15:19.668 --> 15:21.629
(sighs)

15:21.670 --> 15:23.797
How's Corinne?

15:26.258 --> 15:28.510
I just want things to be okay
between her and Adam.

15:28.552 --> 15:30.846
And...

15:30.888 --> 15:33.682
I wish there were something
I could do to help that.

15:33.724 --> 15:36.101
Yeah, there is.
Just stay away from them.

15:37.895 --> 15:39.063
Danny.

15:39.104 --> 15:40.522
Stay away from them.

15:44.401 --> 15:46.195
(children shouting, laughing)

15:46.236 --> 15:47.863
WESTON:
So, I, uh...
I talked to your dad.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.698
And?
And he confirmed

15:49.740 --> 15:51.867
he's Capero326.
(kettle whistling)

15:51.909 --> 15:54.119
He was brief, no-nonsense,
but, uh...

15:54.161 --> 15:56.288
still funny.
(whistling stops)

15:56.330 --> 15:58.332
I think readers are
going to love him.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.583
Good.

16:01.835 --> 16:03.337
You know,
a quote from his daughter

16:03.379 --> 16:04.546
would make them love him
even more.

16:04.588 --> 16:06.423
I don't think that's necessary.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.883
Okay.

16:07.925 --> 16:09.426
Well, how about a quote

16:09.468 --> 16:10.928
from the leader of the country
that took him in?

16:13.430 --> 16:15.224
Talking to me will give you
a chance to explain yourself.

16:15.265 --> 16:16.558
"Explain myself"?

16:16.600 --> 16:17.893
Well, you knew who your dad was

16:17.935 --> 16:19.645
and what he had done,

16:19.687 --> 16:21.230
and you decided
to grant him shelter.

16:21.271 --> 16:23.273
I mean, the world's gonna want
to know why.

16:23.315 --> 16:24.900
You said you wanted
to give Paul a chance

16:24.942 --> 16:26.652
to tell his side of the story.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.278
He's done that.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.989
How does me
going on the record help him?

16:30.030 --> 16:31.782
It would make for
a better story.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.575
That doesn't help him.
That helps you.

16:33.617 --> 16:35.536
Yes, I want to tell
the best story possible.

16:35.577 --> 16:38.872
And yeah, maybe I'm not afraid
of a little shine, but...

16:38.914 --> 16:40.958
Look, the better this is,

16:41.000 --> 16:42.459
the better folks will
think of Paul.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.712
A few words from you
about what you saw in him

16:44.753 --> 16:46.255
that made him worth protecting

16:46.296 --> 16:47.715
will help other people
see the same.

16:47.756 --> 16:49.466
A brilliant writer like you?

16:49.508 --> 16:52.469
I'm sure your words
will be enough.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.179
You don't need any of mine.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.565
(knocking at door)

17:08.193 --> 17:09.903
Absolutely not.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.405
Come on.
One dog is enough.

17:11.447 --> 17:13.282
AJ, please, please.
The hotel manager

17:13.323 --> 17:14.908
won't let me
keep him there,

17:14.950 --> 17:16.702
and I can't bring him
to Sweetie Pie.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.037
Okay?

17:18.078 --> 17:20.706
Look, he's a fluffy
little angel.

17:20.748 --> 17:22.124
I promise he's gonna
sleep all day.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.876
Fine.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.002
(exhales)

17:25.044 --> 17:26.045
Bless you.

17:26.086 --> 17:27.337
Bless you, bless you.

17:27.379 --> 17:28.797
Why don't you just get

17:28.839 --> 17:30.549
a new place?

17:30.591 --> 17:32.134
The hotel was always supposed
to be temporary anyway.

17:32.176 --> 17:34.344
The idea of finding
a new place right now is--

17:34.386 --> 17:35.387
That's-that's a lot.

17:35.429 --> 17:36.972
When I think
about a "home,"

17:37.014 --> 17:38.390
I think about the place
I built for Patience.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.517
Okay? Nothing is gonna
live up to that.

17:40.559 --> 17:42.394
It doesn't have to.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.313
The house you built
will always be special.

17:44.354 --> 17:46.190
But losing it does not
mean you have to live

17:46.231 --> 17:48.025
out of a hotel for
the rest of your life, Grover.

17:48.067 --> 17:51.528
Look how much he loves
his doggy day care, though.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.238
Come on.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.531
All right.

17:54.573 --> 17:55.908
Enough with
the grease gun. Come on.

17:55.949 --> 17:57.826
(laughs)

17:57.868 --> 17:59.995
Thanks.
Ah, yes.

18:02.956 --> 18:05.125
I'm gonna have another lawyer
just double-check

18:05.167 --> 18:07.127
Greylock's coltan agreement
with Lydon

18:07.169 --> 18:08.420
before the first batch arrives.

18:08.462 --> 18:09.546
You don't trust me?

18:09.588 --> 18:11.924
I don't trust your bosses.

18:11.965 --> 18:13.342
Well, look who it is.

18:13.967 --> 18:16.220
I bet you thought it was
hilarious, hanging out with me

18:16.261 --> 18:18.305
while you were
screwing my wife behind my back.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.724
Adam...

18:20.766 --> 18:22.518
I'm sorry.

18:22.559 --> 18:24.895
Not yet, but you will be.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.523
Okay. Okay. Um...

18:27.564 --> 18:30.067
Danny, just go.
I'll talk to you later.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.985
Danny.

18:39.827 --> 18:43.038
Adam, punching my brother
won't make things better.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.915
Trust me,
I would know.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.667
It'll make me feel better.
It'll make you

18:46.708 --> 18:48.669
arrested for assault
is what it'll make you.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.755
I should've known
you'd be on his side.
No.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.007
The only side I'm on
is Corinne's.

18:54.049 --> 18:56.343
Come on, Adam, this is...
is killing her.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.303
What, and it isn't killing me?

18:58.345 --> 18:59.763
She made a mistake.

18:59.805 --> 19:00.848
It's over.

19:00.889 --> 19:02.724
You're her whole world.

19:02.766 --> 19:05.227
Just keep your douchebag excuse
for a brother away from me.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.562
(sniffles)

19:07.312 --> 19:11.150
I guess I just don't know why
the nurse was so hard on Romeo.

19:11.191 --> 19:13.152
Doesn't she want
Juliet to be happy?

19:13.193 --> 19:15.070
Well, Romeo's a toolbox, 'kay?

19:15.112 --> 19:16.822
Dude's head over heels
for Rosaline,

19:16.864 --> 19:18.532
then drops her
like a hot potato

19:18.574 --> 19:20.325
the second a new pair
of boobs walks in.

19:20.367 --> 19:22.327
Mrs. Dearborn,
what do you think?
Hmm.

19:22.369 --> 19:23.829
Hmm?

19:23.871 --> 19:25.539
Romeo and Juliet were
meant to be, right?

19:25.581 --> 19:27.791
Well, they're both dead
in the end, so I don't know.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.501

30:54.477 --> 30:56.020
Hi.

30:57.897 --> 31:00.108
(quietly):
Uh...

31:00.149 --> 31:02.610
If we're gonna do this,
sit down.

31:02.652 --> 31:05.864

over me for one life.

Oh.
You might have
fooled Sarah with this

31:18.126 --> 31:19.711
Well, no one has

31:19.752 --> 31:22.088
more of a right to be skeptical
of me than you.

31:24.048 --> 31:28.136
(sighs) I'm not here
to make you a believer.

31:28.177 --> 31:32.724
I'm here... to apologize.

31:32.765 --> 31:34.851
You think one "I'm sorry"

31:34.893 --> 31:36.728
is-is gonna buy you redemption?

31:36.769 --> 31:38.104
After what I did to you,

31:38.146 --> 31:39.647
there's no such thing
as redemption.

31:40.148 --> 31:42.901
I know that you're
never gonna forgive me.

31:44.819 --> 31:46.988
You shouldn't.

31:48.448 --> 31:50.617
I'll never forgive me.

31:54.037 --> 31:57.290
But you deserve
to hear me acknowledge...

31:58.958 --> 32:00.501
I failed you.

32:01.669 --> 32:04.005
I should've protected you,

32:04.047 --> 32:06.674

32:09.844 --> 32:11.346

Thank you.

But, uh...

35:52.942 --> 35:54.610
something I have to do.

35:54.652 --> 35:58.114
And someone I know
has taught me

35:58.156 --> 36:00.283
that if you see an injustice
in the world,

36:00.324 --> 36:02.743
you have to do
everything you can to stop it,

36:02.785 --> 36:04.704
no matter what.

36:06.372 --> 36:09.000

36:23.931 --> 36:27.435
Uh, I wised up
and finally got a house.

36:28.519 --> 36:30.521
Yeah. You-you were right.

36:30.563 --> 36:31.939
Tito deserves better.

36:31.981 --> 36:33.107
And it's his,
it's his house, really.

McCall's place was empty.

36:37.445 --> 36:39.488
Uh, the best part is,
Mrs. McCall said

36:39.530 --> 36:40.740
that I can move in right away

36:40.781 --> 36:42.700

to make it feel like home.

That's great.
That's great, Grover.
Yeah.

what Tito did

more useful in demolition

41:13.596 --> 41:16.265
But I need Adam,
too, and I...

41:17.224 --> 41:18.601
Right now, I can't have both.

41:18.642 --> 41:21.145
♪ Who are we? ♪

41:21.187 --> 41:23.063

A couple months.

41:23.105 --> 41:25.441
A year.

41:25.483 --> 41:28.319
And then Adam will see
how serious I am

41:28.360 --> 41:31.489

41:31.530 --> 41:32.740
Until then, we'll just...

41:32.781 --> 41:34.450
Until then...

41:34.492 --> 41:38.412

I lose my best friend?

41:38.454 --> 41:39.914

41:39.955 --> 41:41.582
Corinne, please.
Please, no, no.

No, Corinne.
