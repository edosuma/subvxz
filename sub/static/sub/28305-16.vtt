00:01.566 --> 00:02.872
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Once upon a time, friends,

00:02.915 --> 00:04.221
Jane and Rafael had a baby.
But this isn't

00:04.265 --> 00:07.268
a fairy tale;
it's a telenovela.

00:07.311 --> 00:10.314
So the baby was kidnapped
by the evil Sin Rostro.

00:10.358 --> 00:12.012
ROSE:
I had a dragonfly brooch.

00:12.055 --> 00:13.709
Get it,
and I'll give you Mateo.

00:13.752 --> 00:16.016
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Luckily, they got Mateo back.

00:16.059 --> 00:17.495
And years later,
Jane was writing

00:17.539 --> 00:19.062
a book about what happened.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.759
And she got an agent.

00:20.803 --> 00:21.847
Also winning...

00:21.891 --> 00:24.285
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

00:24.328 --> 00:27.766
That's right, Petra gained full ownership of the Marbella.

00:27.810 --> 00:29.855
And since
Rafael was once the owner...

00:29.899 --> 00:32.249
I want to offer you a
job-- and a percentage

00:32.293 --> 00:33.729
of everything we build
together going forward.

00:33.772 --> 00:35.339
And he could really use
the distraction,

00:35.383 --> 00:36.949
because his sister
was still involved

00:36.993 --> 00:37.950
with Sin Rostro.

00:37.994 --> 00:39.430
But she does have a plan, right?

00:39.474 --> 00:42.085
Rose always has a plan.

00:42.129 --> 00:43.826
ROSE:
Now that everything
is in place,

00:43.869 --> 00:46.481
we can move forward.
Is everyone ready?

00:46.524 --> 00:49.005
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know. Straight out
of a telenovela, right?

00:49.049 --> 00:51.573
Well, imagine this: Jane's
father was a telenovela star.

00:51.616 --> 00:54.402
But she didn't know him
until she was 23 years old.

00:54.445 --> 00:57.361
I can't believe you've only
been in my life for seven years.

00:57.405 --> 00:59.537
Oh, and Rogelio was finally
close to his dream:

00:59.581 --> 01:03.106
bringing his telenovela
to an American audience.

01:03.150 --> 01:05.065
Even if that meant
he wasn't the star.

01:05.108 --> 01:07.241
I'm okay being sidelined
just a little.

01:07.284 --> 01:09.417
It's different for you.
You've got these great

01:09.460 --> 01:10.983
relationships with
your daughters,

01:11.027 --> 01:13.160
whereas mine barely
even speaks to me.

01:13.203 --> 01:14.552
I can help you win her back.

01:14.596 --> 01:16.554
Ah, if only it were that easy.

01:16.598 --> 01:17.903
But this is a telenovela.

01:17.947 --> 01:19.470
So let's see what happens next.

01:21.342 --> 01:23.257
As you all know by now,

01:23.300 --> 01:26.129
our Jane
grew up on telenovelas.

01:26.173 --> 01:29.263
And, oh, how she loved
the romance,

01:29.306 --> 01:31.395
the drama...

01:34.224 --> 01:36.444
...the adventure.

01:36.487 --> 01:39.099
But one thing
she never loved?

01:39.142 --> 01:41.536
The scary stuff.

01:41.579 --> 01:43.494
You'd better look,
or you won't know how it ends.

01:43.538 --> 01:45.322
Honestly, I can't blame her.

01:45.366 --> 01:47.368
It's not my favorite, either.

01:49.326 --> 01:52.460
But we can't hide
from the scares forever.

01:52.503 --> 01:54.026
So?

01:54.070 --> 01:55.463
Is he dead?

01:55.506 --> 01:56.681
You killed it.

01:58.727 --> 02:01.469
The romance, the
drama, the adventure

02:01.512 --> 02:04.298
in your novel are all great.

02:04.341 --> 02:05.560
But the crime is
totally anticlimactic.

02:05.603 --> 02:07.039
You got to do better.

02:07.388 --> 02:09.520
She right, by the way.
See, even now,

02:09.564 --> 02:12.610
Jane wasn't as interested
in the scary stuff.

02:12.654 --> 02:14.525
Anticlimactic because...?

02:14.569 --> 02:16.179
Because the crime story
ends midway through

02:16.223 --> 02:18.181
when the villain
is sent to prison.

02:18.225 --> 02:21.097
I kept expecting her to
come back like...

02:21.141 --> 02:22.881
but she never did.

02:22.925 --> 02:26.581
Because I wanted to end the book
on an uplifting note.

02:26.624 --> 02:28.800
Joy, love, all that stuff.

02:28.844 --> 02:31.281
Yeah, I get that,
but I don't 100% care.

02:31.325 --> 02:33.588
I care about what
the book needs.

02:33.631 --> 02:35.851
If you want this book
to sell, you have got

02:35.894 --> 02:37.853
to embrace the
crime in a big way.

02:37.896 --> 02:39.811
Build to an
explosive climax.

02:39.855 --> 02:41.204
Got it?

02:41.248 --> 02:42.597
Yes.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.729
Got it.

02:53.825 --> 02:55.566
JANE:
So, uh, an explosive...

02:55.610 --> 02:58.613
crime climax.Do you want to brainstorm?

02:58.656 --> 03:00.092
No, it's...
Oh, yeah.
Let's do it.

03:00.136 --> 03:02.094
Don't worry about it.
It's what I'm here for. Okay.

03:02.138 --> 03:04.445
Hmm, now, it can be anything,
but it has to threaten

03:04.488 --> 03:06.447
everything and has
to be unexpected.

03:06.490 --> 03:08.971
Maybe...

03:09.014 --> 03:10.581
the villain comes back.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.366
Or maybe one of
her past crimes

03:12.409 --> 03:14.759
comes to light in
a... in a new way,

03:14.803 --> 03:16.935
like old tunnels leading
to a new hideout.

03:16.979 --> 03:18.807
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Eh, I wouldn't exactly

03:18.850 --> 03:21.244
call that an explosive climax.

03:21.288 --> 03:24.029
Or her ex-husband
survives the cement.

03:24.073 --> 03:25.727
Got to do better, Lily.

03:26.989 --> 03:28.469
Oh, oh, I've got
something good.

03:28.512 --> 03:30.340
What if...

03:30.384 --> 03:31.907
when the villain
kidnaps the baby,

03:31.950 --> 03:34.301
she swaps it out
for a different one?

03:34.344 --> 03:37.217
Oh. Wow.

03:37.260 --> 03:38.914
Scary, right?

03:38.957 --> 03:42.396
Yeah, th-that would be...
terrifying.

03:42.439 --> 03:44.398
Agreed.

03:44.441 --> 03:46.400
Don't go there, Jane.

03:55.409 --> 03:57.759
Oh, no. She's going there.

03:59.369 --> 04:01.241
JANE:
Oh, my God.

04:01.284 --> 04:02.503
Mommy's here.MATEO: Mommy?

04:03.547 --> 04:05.288
Can you fix this?

04:05.332 --> 04:07.682
Mm-hmm.

04:11.338 --> 04:15.298
And from one anxious mother
to another.

04:15.342 --> 04:18.475
I had them flown in from your
favorite bakery in New York.

04:18.519 --> 04:20.303
I know that you've
been homesick, and I

04:20.347 --> 04:22.349
just wanted to give you
a little taste of home.

04:22.392 --> 04:23.698
Yeah, cupcakes
aren't gonna make up for

04:23.741 --> 04:25.308
you missing my entire childhood.

04:25.352 --> 04:27.005
So...

04:30.444 --> 04:31.836
See?

04:31.880 --> 04:34.448
It's a total failure.
I told you.

04:34.491 --> 04:36.537
Have faith, River.

04:36.580 --> 04:39.496
She took a job on your show.
There's a reason for that.

04:39.540 --> 04:40.976
Yeah. Money.

04:41.019 --> 04:43.326
I pay her five times
what a normal P.A. makes.

04:43.370 --> 04:46.286
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wow. Almost a living wage.

04:46.329 --> 04:48.331
I-I think I
just need to accept

04:48.375 --> 04:49.854
we've got a crappy
relationship

04:49.898 --> 04:51.378
and move on.

04:51.421 --> 04:53.423
Can you even hear yourself?

04:53.467 --> 04:55.773
You cannot give up.
What is the point

04:55.817 --> 04:58.515
of all of this if you cannot
share it with your children?

04:58.559 --> 05:00.648
Family is everything.
It's all that matters.

05:03.781 --> 05:05.392
It's the network.

05:05.435 --> 05:07.350
Rogelio de la Vega,

05:07.394 --> 05:09.570
EP and costar.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.357
Okay, okay. Thank you.
You won't regret this.

05:14.401 --> 05:15.837
Bye.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.534
They love the pilot.

05:17.578 --> 05:20.450
They're ordering
This Is Marsto series.

05:20.494 --> 05:22.452
We did it. We did it.

05:22.496 --> 05:25.455
We have it all!Not really.

05:25.499 --> 05:26.587
Like you said,

05:26.630 --> 05:28.502
family is everything.

05:28.545 --> 05:30.765
My daughter still hates me.

05:30.808 --> 05:33.202
Oh, it'll work itself out.
Here, have a cupcake.

05:33.245 --> 05:34.812
We're going to series.

05:34.856 --> 05:37.859
You're giving birth to a show,
and this baby will...

05:37.902 --> 05:40.688
definitely love you back!

05:40.731 --> 05:42.124
PETRA:
This is my baby.

05:42.167 --> 05:44.213
I need the pop-up
to go perfectly.

05:44.256 --> 05:46.824
It will. The event
is already sold out.

05:46.868 --> 05:48.783
Tons of press are
confirmed to attend.

05:48.826 --> 05:51.481
You've obsessed over
every detail, including how much

05:51.525 --> 05:52.613
cologne I'm allowed to wear.

05:52.656 --> 05:54.789
Which we agreed
is zero, correct?

05:54.832 --> 05:56.921
I can't have anything
interfering with Ludo's food.

05:56.965 --> 05:58.793
Come on. Why are you so nervous?

05:58.836 --> 06:00.708
Because...

06:00.751 --> 06:02.971
Clarissa James is coming.

06:03.014 --> 06:04.407
Ooh.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.322
Is it someone you're seeing?

06:06.366 --> 06:08.150
Come on, spill it.
I want to know everything.

06:08.193 --> 06:09.804
Okay, stand down,
girlfriend.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.458
No. She's an investor.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.460
Who specializes in
hotel franchising.

06:13.503 --> 06:15.244
As in franchising the Marbella?

06:15.287 --> 06:16.419
I had no idea

06:16.463 --> 06:17.942
you were even
thinking about that.

06:17.986 --> 06:19.422
Not thinking about it.
Dreaming about it.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.555
I want a Marbella
in every major city.

06:21.598 --> 06:22.773
On every continent.

06:22.817 --> 06:24.688
Does that
sound insane?Yes.

06:24.732 --> 06:26.560
But if anyone can pull it off...

06:26.603 --> 06:27.909
I know. It's me, right?

06:27.952 --> 06:29.519
I hadn't even
put out feelers yet.

06:29.563 --> 06:31.565
Clarissa just got in touch
out of the blue.

06:31.608 --> 06:34.437
Oh, I'm so excited, I don't
know how I'll sleep tonight.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.624
Jane.
Hmm?

06:47.668 --> 06:49.365
Are you okay?

06:49.409 --> 06:51.846
Yeah.

06:51.889 --> 06:53.543
My-my mom wants
to start

06:53.587 --> 06:55.066
our dance lessons
for the wedding.

06:55.110 --> 06:56.720
Dance lessons?

06:56.764 --> 06:58.983
That's what's got you
tossing and turning?

07:01.290 --> 07:02.552
Come on, what is it?

07:03.727 --> 07:05.468
M-My agent...

07:05.512 --> 07:07.557
was giving me notes
on the crime in my novel,

07:07.601 --> 07:09.690
and... she said
something crazy.

07:09.733 --> 07:11.909
And I can't
get it out of my head

07:11.953 --> 07:14.042
even though
I know it's crazy.

07:14.085 --> 07:15.478
Okay.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.611
Well, what
did she say?

07:17.654 --> 07:19.569
That Rose might have
swapped Mateo

07:19.613 --> 07:21.484
for another baby
when she kidnapped him.

07:25.009 --> 07:26.924
Oh, my God.

07:26.968 --> 07:28.491
Oh, my God!
Wait a second,

07:28.535 --> 07:31.276
you're supposed to be
telling me that I'm crazy.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.496
I-I'm sorry,
but it-it's just Rose.

07:33.540 --> 07:35.280
She's capable of anything.

07:35.324 --> 07:37.631
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, great. Now I can't sleep.

07:43.245 --> 07:44.768
So you actually think
it's possible that Mateo

07:44.812 --> 07:46.553
was switched at birth?
No.

07:46.596 --> 07:48.076
I-I just mean,
it's not...

07:48.119 --> 07:49.773
impossible.

07:49.817 --> 07:51.601
Oh, my God.But wait. But wait. Okay.

07:51.645 --> 07:52.907
Let's-let's just
think this through

07:52.950 --> 07:54.909
before we both
freak out.
Too late.

07:54.952 --> 07:57.302
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Agreed. Come on.

07:57.346 --> 07:59.130
Rose has a reason
for everything.

07:59.174 --> 08:00.915
Right? So there was
no motivation for her

08:00.958 --> 08:02.525
to switch out Mateo.

08:02.569 --> 08:04.571
She was only interested
in one thing at the time.

08:04.614 --> 08:06.224
The brooch. Right.

08:06.268 --> 08:08.009
Which she got.

08:08.052 --> 08:09.532
So it doesn't make
any sense for her

08:09.576 --> 08:11.403
to give us back a baby
that wasn't ours.

08:11.447 --> 08:13.928
That's true.
That's a really good point.

08:13.971 --> 08:15.277
And that right there.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.539
Okay? That crinkle.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.367
In your forehead.
Mateo has that same

08:18.410 --> 08:20.848
exact crinkle in the same
place when he frowns.

08:20.891 --> 08:22.937
That's true.
And do you
remember when we

08:22.980 --> 08:25.417
put my baby pictures side
by side next to Mateo's?

08:25.461 --> 08:26.506
You were twins.

08:26.549 --> 08:27.594
Right?
Right.

08:27.637 --> 08:28.986
So, rationally,
there's no way

08:29.030 --> 08:30.727
Mateo isn't our son.

08:30.771 --> 08:33.077
Your agent was just giving
you an idea for your book.

08:33.121 --> 08:34.557
It's not real.
End of story.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.080
In fact, ask me again.

08:36.124 --> 08:38.561
So, my agent
said maybe...
That's crazy.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.960
Okay. I feel better.

08:46.003 --> 08:48.179
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I don't, honestly.

08:48.223 --> 08:49.398
Hey, Raf.

08:49.441 --> 08:51.966
And now neither does he.

08:52.009 --> 08:53.837
If you don't leave immediately,
I'm calling security.

08:53.881 --> 08:56.405
Oh, no, I am leaving. For good.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.190
I came to say goodbye.

08:59.234 --> 09:00.627
Didn't we just do this?

09:00.670 --> 09:02.193
Well, no, then I was just

09:02.237 --> 09:03.673
going to an ashram
for two weeks.

09:03.717 --> 09:05.719
This is a more...
permanent goodbye.

09:07.634 --> 09:10.506
So goodbye.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.899
Permanently.

09:11.942 --> 09:14.118
Goodbye.

09:16.164 --> 09:18.209
I heard you're getting married.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.733
I'm so happy for you

09:19.776 --> 09:22.736
and Jane, and I'm
really sorry for everything.

09:22.779 --> 09:24.346
I really am.

09:24.389 --> 09:27.392
I love you, Rafael.

09:27.436 --> 09:29.525
Well, maybe that would have
meant something

09:29.569 --> 09:32.136
if you weren't involved
with a criminal.

09:38.708 --> 09:41.232
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And speaking of crime...

10:13.961 --> 10:15.963
PETRA:
I can't believe it.

10:16.006 --> 10:18.618
I-I've been a fan of you and
your hotel since I started.

10:18.661 --> 10:21.055
The first time
I slid into a set

10:21.098 --> 10:22.534
of Marcienne hotel sheets,

10:22.578 --> 10:24.624
I think I wept a
little.

10:24.667 --> 10:27.365
Oh. Well, I only
invest in the best.

10:27.409 --> 10:31.369
Which is why I am honored you're
interested in helping me expand.

10:31.413 --> 10:33.284
Well, actually,
it was my guru who suggested

10:33.328 --> 10:35.025
that I take a look
at the Marbella.

10:35.069 --> 10:36.548
Uh...

10:36.592 --> 10:39.639
Well, hey, whoever this guru
is, she sounds really smart.

10:39.682 --> 10:41.684
I love
her already.

10:41.728 --> 10:44.295
Oh, good.
Well, she's actually here.

10:44.339 --> 10:45.470
I take her everywhere.

10:45.514 --> 10:48.212
She helps me make
all my decisions.

10:48.256 --> 10:51.651
Maggie? Come on in.

10:51.694 --> 10:55.176
Shalom. So very nice
to meet you.

10:55.219 --> 10:57.265
Petra, is it?

10:58.788 --> 11:00.616
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Let the good times roll.

11:02.574 --> 11:05.708
I'm supposed to meet someone
here, uh... Jane Villanueva?

11:05.752 --> 11:09.538
Oh, uh, hi.
That's me.

11:09.581 --> 11:12.628
Stop reading and say hello.

11:16.806 --> 11:18.852
Are you my real mommy?

11:23.291 --> 11:25.815
JANE:
I can't live
with this uncertainty.

11:25.859 --> 11:28.426
I looked it up,
and it might just be

11:28.470 --> 11:30.124
a temporary skin
discoloration from labor,

11:30.167 --> 11:32.256
but it could also
be a birthmark,

11:32.300 --> 11:34.606
and Mateo doesn't
have a birthmark.

11:34.650 --> 11:36.130
So, you want a DNA test?

11:36.173 --> 11:39.220
No. I don't want one,
but we have to get one.

11:39.263 --> 11:41.613
Rose had no motive
to swap Mateo.

11:41.657 --> 11:43.180
She's a sociopath,
Rafael.

11:43.224 --> 11:45.269
There is no rationalizing
her motives.

11:45.313 --> 11:47.228
You know it's possible.

11:47.271 --> 11:48.795
But it's-it's not probable.

11:48.838 --> 11:51.101
And I wish I could
live with that.

11:51.145 --> 11:53.060
But I can't.

11:54.104 --> 11:56.716
Okay.

11:56.759 --> 12:00.284
Okay.
So we'll-we'll do the test.

12:00.328 --> 12:01.721
Okay.

12:07.770 --> 12:09.293
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, friends, we last left

12:09.337 --> 12:10.642
our Jane on
a fact-finding mission.

12:10.686 --> 12:12.253
Okay, Mr. Sweetface,
we just have to

12:12.296 --> 12:13.471
swab your cheek really quickly.

12:13.515 --> 12:16.257
Why?It's just a little test

12:16.300 --> 12:17.998
to make sure you're getting
enough vitamins in the morning.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.826
Okay.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.658
That's it?

12:26.702 --> 12:28.660
That's it. Easy.

12:31.707 --> 12:33.317
Don't worry.

12:33.361 --> 12:35.102
It's gonna be fine.

12:42.457 --> 12:44.459
Okay.
Well, I'd better get to work.

12:44.502 --> 12:45.852
Help Petra with...

12:45.895 --> 12:46.853
Maggie.

12:46.896 --> 12:49.029
What do you want?

12:49.072 --> 12:50.857
To help you,
dear daughter.

12:50.900 --> 12:53.424
I met Clarissa
in rehab.

12:53.468 --> 12:56.819
Ugh, it was very boring,
so I watch a lot of Netflix.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.821
There was this documentary,
Wild Wild Country...

12:58.865 --> 13:00.823
Get to the point.

13:00.867 --> 13:04.044
I become
Clarissa's guru.

13:04.087 --> 13:06.263
And then I give
her Marbella idea.

13:06.307 --> 13:07.743
You are welcome.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.614
Now I want half of hotel.

13:09.658 --> 13:10.877
I'm not negotiating.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.704
You should.
Why?

13:12.748 --> 13:14.706
You don't have
a leg to stand on.

13:14.750 --> 13:16.708
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Low blow, Petra. MAGDA: Okay.

13:16.752 --> 13:19.363
I just tell Clarissa
this hotel has bad juju,

13:19.407 --> 13:21.713
and we will be on our way.

13:21.757 --> 13:25.065
$500 a month
for you to leave the country

13:25.108 --> 13:26.936
and never set foot
in the United States again.

13:26.980 --> 13:30.679
That is nothing compared
to what I am giving you.

13:32.115 --> 13:35.336
$5,000 a month.
Final offer.

13:35.379 --> 13:39.296
Well, my final offer is:
I want half of hotel.

13:39.340 --> 13:42.343
Without me,
you have no Clarissa.

13:42.386 --> 13:44.824
ROGELIO:
This can't be happening.

13:44.867 --> 13:47.174
We have a meeting
with the network in one hour.

13:47.217 --> 13:48.566
Why are you not ready?

13:48.610 --> 13:50.655
Are you sick?
Is it terminal?

13:50.699 --> 13:53.745
Do you think you could make it
five to seven more years?

13:53.789 --> 13:58.098
I'm just getting an infusion
of B12 and C concentrates.

13:58.141 --> 13:59.099
There's nothing wrong
with her body.

13:59.142 --> 14:00.665
This is about her soul.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.624
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh. Is that all?

14:02.667 --> 14:04.756
I realized you were right.

14:04.800 --> 14:07.324
Success means nothing
without the love and support

14:07.368 --> 14:08.760
of my daughter.

14:08.804 --> 14:10.893
And that will come. For sure.

14:10.937 --> 14:13.896
But in the meantime,
we just got a show picked up.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.898
By a major network.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.682
Love and support that.

14:17.726 --> 14:19.641
I can't. You see,

14:19.684 --> 14:24.428
I had built up this wall
over the years,

14:24.472 --> 14:30.086
and I've been able to keep
these huge emotions at bay.

14:30.130 --> 14:33.960
But you, Rogelio, you
tore down that wall.

14:34.003 --> 14:36.963
And now...
I'm just overcome

14:37.006 --> 14:39.879
with this painful,

14:39.922 --> 14:43.099
all-consuming emptiness.

14:43.143 --> 14:46.363
Well, then let's rebuild
that wall.

14:46.407 --> 14:48.757
We can do it together
brick by brick.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.585
There's no going back.

14:50.628 --> 14:52.848
This river's dam has burst.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.024
Right now, all I
can do is get back

14:55.068 --> 14:57.505
into intensive psychotherapy.

14:57.548 --> 14:58.941
And who knows?

14:58.985 --> 15:00.943
Maybe the fact that
I'm turning down the chance

15:00.987 --> 15:02.597
for a big successful hit show

15:02.640 --> 15:05.861
and the millions of
dollars that come with it

15:05.905 --> 15:08.124
will impress Pond.

15:08.168 --> 15:09.821
What are you talking about?

15:09.865 --> 15:12.346
I'm sorry, Rogelio.

15:12.389 --> 15:14.304
I can't accept the pickup.

15:15.523 --> 15:17.003
XIOMARA:
Calm down, Rogelio.

15:17.046 --> 15:19.353
Inhala, exhala.

15:19.396 --> 15:20.571
You can fix this.

15:20.615 --> 15:21.877
You just need
to talk to Pond.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.705
You can get
through to her.

15:23.748 --> 15:25.185
You're the daughter
whisperer.

15:25.228 --> 15:26.926
Bye.

15:26.969 --> 15:29.232
If now is not a good
time, we can come back.

15:29.276 --> 15:32.366
No. Rogelio's good, and your
wedding dance has to be great.

15:32.409 --> 15:34.368
Besides, this is
the perfect way to keep me

15:34.411 --> 15:37.023
from stressing about
my first day of nursing school.

15:37.066 --> 15:39.373
Just three days away.What did I just say?

15:39.416 --> 15:41.375
Are you trying to kill me?Sorry. Sorry.

15:41.418 --> 15:42.724
Ah. Oops.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.992
All right, let's dance.
You guys watch the video?

15:50.036 --> 15:51.863
We did.Yep.

15:56.303 --> 15:59.001
Mateo's ours.
Don't worry.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.960
He is, right?Yes.

16:05.529 --> 16:06.966
You guys are a little stiff.

16:07.009 --> 16:08.880
I...

16:12.580 --> 16:14.843
Sorry, we're both just
stressed about work.

16:14.886 --> 16:17.106
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And the results of
a certain DNA test.

16:17.150 --> 16:19.543
Come on, Ma.
Let's show them how it's done.

16:23.547 --> 16:24.940
JANE:
Abuela.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.986
Who knew you could
move your hips like that.

16:27.029 --> 16:29.727
RAFAEL:
Oh, Alba's got moves.
I read all about Pablo

16:29.771 --> 16:31.381
in Jane's book.

16:33.340 --> 16:38.084
Uh... well, yeah.

16:46.135 --> 16:48.137
I mean... yeah.

16:53.447 --> 16:55.840
But when you read
the beginning of my book,

16:55.884 --> 16:57.668
about Venezuela,
you were fine with it.

17:01.368 --> 17:03.892
You didn't think my book
was going anywhere?

17:11.117 --> 17:12.509
Oh, this is about Jorge?

17:15.251 --> 17:18.037
You brought him up.Okay, why doesn't everybody
just take a breath.

17:18.080 --> 17:19.560
I'm sure we can
find a solution.

17:25.131 --> 17:26.132
What?! But...

17:30.179 --> 17:31.485
I drove you here.

17:36.838 --> 17:38.057
Mom, you're calling me.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.200
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, yes, we last left our Jane

17:51.244 --> 17:53.289
trying to rewrite
her grandmother's story.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.906
Look at you two!XIOMARA:
I found the perfect partner

18:01.950 --> 18:05.084
to help me finish choreographing
your wedding dance.

18:05.127 --> 18:07.042
Show Mommy your twirl.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.739
Bravo, Mr. Sweetface.

18:10.785 --> 18:12.700
Thank you so much
for watching him today.Of course.

18:12.743 --> 18:14.049
How's the writing going?

18:14.093 --> 18:16.269
I mean, I'm taking out
the central theme,

18:16.312 --> 18:19.315
so not much makes sense in the
book anymore, but, you know...

18:19.359 --> 18:20.708
I'm sorry, hon.

18:20.751 --> 18:23.145
Ah, it's okay.
I'm just frustrated.

18:23.189 --> 18:25.930
I was already struggling
with notes from my agent.

18:25.974 --> 18:27.497
Didn't know
I was gonna have to deal

18:27.541 --> 18:29.108
with notes from my abuela,too.

18:29.151 --> 18:29.934
You know what?

18:29.978 --> 18:31.153
Send the book to me.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.546
I'll give it to her.

18:32.589 --> 18:34.025
Trust me,
she'll feel differently

18:34.069 --> 18:35.549
when she actually reads it.

18:35.592 --> 18:37.507
ROGELIO:
What are you reading?

18:40.119 --> 18:41.729
What are you doing here?

18:41.772 --> 18:45.036
This is my favorite...
coffee shop

18:45.080 --> 18:47.735
slash, uh,
computer place

18:47.778 --> 18:49.693
slash eatery.

18:49.737 --> 18:50.955
So hip.

18:50.999 --> 18:53.001
Okay, fine.
I tracked you down

18:53.044 --> 18:54.611
because your mom
is really hurting.

18:54.655 --> 18:58.006
Don't you think it might
be time to forgive her?

18:58.049 --> 18:59.181
No.

19:00.356 --> 19:02.358
Let me paint you
a painful little picture.

19:02.402 --> 19:04.404
It's 2004, the year
my mother won

19:04.447 --> 19:06.971
her Emmy for that HBO movie,
Plath on Plath:

19:07.015 --> 19:08.495
The Sylvia Plath Story.

19:08.538 --> 19:10.801
"As told by the ghost
of Sylvia Plath."

19:10.845 --> 19:12.890
Of course. She slayed.

19:14.022 --> 19:15.066
I'm sorry. Please continue.

19:15.110 --> 19:17.025
So, it's the night
of the Emmys.

19:17.068 --> 19:18.461
My three best friends
are sleeping over

19:18.505 --> 19:19.854
so we can all watch.

19:19.897 --> 19:21.464
I was so excited and proud,

19:21.508 --> 19:24.859
because wow,
my mom was just so cool.

19:24.902 --> 19:27.862
And then she wins.

19:27.905 --> 19:31.387
And there's my mom
accepting her Emmy on live TV

19:31.431 --> 19:34.085
in front of millions
of people.

19:34.129 --> 19:35.217
And then...

19:35.261 --> 19:36.914
You know what?

19:36.958 --> 19:39.090
Let me just show you.

19:41.092 --> 19:42.398
RIVER :
Wow.

19:42.442 --> 19:43.878
Oh! What an honor.

19:43.921 --> 19:47.490
Um, oh, there are
so many people to thank.

19:47.534 --> 19:49.188
Everybody at HBO.

19:49.231 --> 19:50.493
Our writers.

19:50.537 --> 19:53.627
The cast. Our amazing crew.

19:53.670 --> 19:57.108
Ah, my dog walkers,
Yuri and Marigold.

19:57.152 --> 19:58.240
Bless.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.286
My, uh, my-my acupuncturist,

20:00.329 --> 20:02.723
Dr. Mishka. Genius.

20:02.766 --> 20:05.073
And finally...

20:05.116 --> 20:08.990
I want to thank the most
important person in my life.

20:09.033 --> 20:12.776
The person who inspires me
every day to be...

20:12.820 --> 20:15.431
the best person
I can possibly be...

20:15.475 --> 20:17.955
my agent, Don Sherwood.

20:17.999 --> 20:20.001
I love you, Don.

20:20.044 --> 20:22.873
Oh, God, I can't believe
I almost forgot.

20:22.917 --> 20:24.571
Um, sweetheart...

20:24.614 --> 20:26.268
I love you so much.

20:26.312 --> 20:30.272
This is nothing without you.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.231
Carrie, my publicist.

20:32.274 --> 20:34.755
I love you,
I love you, love you.

20:34.798 --> 20:38.106
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oof. That was bad on bad.

20:38.149 --> 20:40.108
Worst night of my life,

20:40.151 --> 20:43.198
and nothing she does
will ever change that.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.460
Understand?

20:44.504 --> 20:45.766
ROGELIO:
Of course I understand,

20:45.809 --> 20:48.769
but now my dream show is dying,

20:48.812 --> 20:51.337
and there's no help
in sight. I'm doomed.

21:04.785 --> 21:06.743
XIOMARA: All right,
ready for some dancing?

21:07.788 --> 21:09.616
ALBA:
Jane.

21:14.011 --> 21:15.535
And what did you think?

21:20.844 --> 21:21.976
Abuela, it's fiction.

21:33.857 --> 21:34.945
Ma, you have to understand
how hard

21:34.989 --> 21:36.425
Jane has worked on this book.

21:36.469 --> 21:38.427
If you make her take out more,
the rest will fall apart.

21:54.269 --> 21:57.316
It's okay, Abuela.
I understand. It's your story.

21:57.359 --> 21:59.056
You have the right to decide

21:59.100 --> 22:00.797
if it gets told.

22:00.841 --> 22:03.322
I'll rewrite the book.
No problem.

22:07.500 --> 22:10.677
A rewrite. Of course.

22:11.982 --> 22:14.071
Oh, sorry. Uh, carry on.

22:14.115 --> 22:16.378
I just realized that a rewrite

22:16.422 --> 22:18.989
could solve
all my problems, too.

22:19.033 --> 22:20.513
But you two, keep fighting.

22:20.556 --> 22:21.905
JANE:
Uh,

22:21.949 --> 22:23.951
we're not fighting.

22:23.994 --> 22:26.257
Everything's okay.

22:26.301 --> 22:29.739
And by "okay," I mean that I
have to do a huge rewrite now

22:29.783 --> 22:31.437
and...

22:34.091 --> 22:37.486
Uh, hey, Mr. Sweetface, uh,
want to go to your room

22:37.530 --> 22:39.532
and color, yeah? Okay.

22:41.185 --> 22:43.666
The DNA results?

22:48.192 --> 22:49.672
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Before she opens it,

22:49.716 --> 22:52.414
I will remind you
this is a telenovela,

22:52.458 --> 22:55.461
so the unexpected
is to be expected.

23:08.299 --> 23:09.910
Oh...

23:18.484 --> 23:20.399
Oh, I'm so relieved.

23:20.442 --> 23:23.967
I know.

23:24.011 --> 23:26.361
But this is it, right?

23:26.405 --> 23:30.191
Because getting a DNA test
for our son is just too much.

23:30.234 --> 23:34.238
You're right. I am gonna
separate fact from fiction

23:34.282 --> 23:38.025
and get over this fear.

23:38.068 --> 23:39.548
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which, for the record,

23:39.592 --> 23:42.203
she was trying to do.

23:44.248 --> 23:46.642
Also trying hard...

23:46.686 --> 23:49.123
As you can see,
our guests feel transported

23:49.166 --> 23:50.820
from the moment
they enter the hotel.

23:50.864 --> 23:52.300
MAGDA: They would
feel more transported

23:52.343 --> 23:54.302
if the drinks
were stronger.

23:54.345 --> 23:56.478
This tastes like
virgin smoothie.

23:56.522 --> 23:58.219
Well, people do
like alcohol

23:58.262 --> 23:59.394
on holiday.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.135
Noted.

24:05.356 --> 24:07.707
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, yes. Let me remind you,

24:07.750 --> 24:12.799
these two have a wild,
wild history.

24:12.842 --> 24:14.540
PETRA:
You should get back
to work now, Alba.

24:14.583 --> 24:16.280
Now, if you'll follow me
up to this platform,

24:16.324 --> 24:17.586
Clarissa, you can
actually see

24:17.630 --> 24:20.676
a view of the ocean
from our lobby.
Ooh!

24:20.720 --> 24:22.678
I can't get up.A shame.

24:22.722 --> 24:24.158
So here's what
I'm thinking.

24:24.201 --> 24:26.508
The pop-up attracts
the adults, okay?

24:26.552 --> 24:29.163
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
All right, things are
looking good here.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.862
Not as good here.

24:32.906 --> 24:34.168
What's going on, hon?

24:34.211 --> 24:36.257
Did Jorge call you? Shoot.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.085
I came here for
a change of scenery,

24:38.128 --> 24:39.695
and because
I wrote most

24:39.739 --> 24:42.611
of my book here,
I thought I might get inspired.

24:42.655 --> 24:44.221
Well, let me talk
to Abuela again

24:44.265 --> 24:45.701
and see if she'll
change her mind.

24:45.745 --> 24:47.224
No, don't. It's her life.

24:47.268 --> 24:49.052
Besides, I can concentrate
on this instead of the crime

24:49.096 --> 24:51.011
which is driving me nuts
and making me do things

24:51.054 --> 24:52.578
like get a DNA test for Mateo.

24:52.621 --> 24:54.188
What?

24:54.231 --> 24:57.496
I got it in my head
that Rose switched babies.

24:57.539 --> 25:00.150
Oh, sweetie.
I know.

25:00.194 --> 25:02.849
She didn't,
but she could've, Mom,

25:02.892 --> 25:04.677
because she's
so dangerous,

25:04.720 --> 25:07.070
which is why I'm wondering
if it's even safe for me

25:07.114 --> 25:09.725
to publish a book about a
mass murderer who's still alive.

25:09.769 --> 25:11.510
Well, you changed details.Enough?

25:11.553 --> 25:13.990
Rose could be really pissed,
and she has

25:14.034 --> 25:15.339
associates outside
of prison.

25:15.383 --> 25:16.819
What if she sends someone

25:16.863 --> 25:18.386
to threaten me and my family,
or worse?

25:18.429 --> 25:21.998
Hon, you have to get her
out of your head.

25:22.042 --> 25:24.610
I know.

25:24.653 --> 25:26.786
I just don't know how.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.357
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
As you'll recall, Jane was

25:33.401 --> 25:34.968
struggling to separate
truth from fiction.

25:35.011 --> 25:37.579
Oh!

25:37.623 --> 25:39.712
Don't worry, Abuela,
I'm doing a big rewrite.

25:39.755 --> 25:41.061
I-I'm actually
thinking of

25:41.104 --> 25:42.671
changing the character
to a grandfather.

25:42.715 --> 25:45.065
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Hmm. I'd like to see that.

25:45.108 --> 25:47.110
Why are you crying,
Abuelo?

25:49.635 --> 25:50.592
Pa.

25:55.031 --> 25:56.467
What?

25:56.511 --> 25:58.818
Did Mom talk to you?
I told her not to.

26:01.429 --> 26:02.473
Then who was it?

26:08.523 --> 26:09.785
Jorge?

26:09.829 --> 26:12.614
Oh, Jane, hi.
Is the soccer game too loud?

26:12.658 --> 26:14.834
Oh, oh, no, no, no,
nothing like that.

26:14.877 --> 26:17.445
I-I-I just wanted
to say thank you

26:17.488 --> 26:20.187
for getting my abuelato change
her mind about my novel.

26:20.230 --> 26:22.189
Saved you a ton of work, huh?

26:22.232 --> 26:24.234
Uh, you sure did.

26:33.504 --> 26:36.638
I feel like there might be
more you want to say.

26:36.682 --> 26:38.118
Yeah. Sorry.

26:38.161 --> 26:40.120
I was just wondering
what exactly you said to her.

26:40.163 --> 26:44.820
I just helped her understand
why this was so hard for her.

26:44.864 --> 26:47.431
Because of her friends
at church?

26:47.475 --> 26:49.259
More than that.

26:50.521 --> 26:53.568
Being undocumented for so long,

26:53.612 --> 26:56.136
you get used to living
with these walls up,

26:56.179 --> 26:57.659
keeping things secret.

26:57.703 --> 27:00.662
And living like that,
it changes you

27:00.706 --> 27:02.838
and how you relate to the world.

27:02.882 --> 27:06.625
It makes you more closed off.

27:06.668 --> 27:10.541
So I just reminded her that
things are different for us now,

27:10.585 --> 27:13.022
which is something
we're still getting used to,

27:13.066 --> 27:15.677
but we're gonna do it together.

27:15.721 --> 27:19.463
Well, I'm really glad
my abuelahas you in her life.

27:21.030 --> 27:22.815
I'm glad I do, too.

27:22.858 --> 27:26.340
Me, too.

27:26.383 --> 27:28.342
Can I put the game back on?

27:28.385 --> 27:30.431
Yes, of course.

27:30.474 --> 27:31.780
PETRA:
Your game's just about over.

27:31.824 --> 27:34.391
I got Clarissa halfway
there without you already.

27:34.435 --> 27:37.351
She wants to invest. I'm gonna
close the deal at the pop-up.

27:37.394 --> 27:39.570
I can change her mind
before that.

27:39.614 --> 27:41.442
Yes, but you won't.

27:44.532 --> 27:46.490
Let me out!Be quiet.

27:46.534 --> 27:48.667
There's some water in there
and some crackers.

27:48.710 --> 27:51.800
I need a security guard
at the offices.

27:51.844 --> 27:53.497
POND:
Is anybody there?

27:53.541 --> 27:56.370
Why is it so dark in here?

27:56.413 --> 27:58.372
Where is everybody?

27:58.415 --> 28:00.983
Hello?

28:01.027 --> 28:03.029
Why are you dressed like that?

28:03.072 --> 28:05.466
Your e-mail said we were
doing reshoots today.

28:05.509 --> 28:07.381
We are. Just not for the show.

28:07.424 --> 28:10.732
Today, we are reshooting life.

28:10.776 --> 28:12.473
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yes, friends, the line

28:12.516 --> 28:13.735
between truth and fiction

28:13.779 --> 28:15.563
is getting blurrier
by the moment.

28:15.606 --> 28:19.523
I... can't believe it.I know.

28:19.567 --> 28:21.656
This dress still fits me after
all these years.

28:21.700 --> 28:24.964
I actually had to
take it in a tiny bit.

28:28.184 --> 28:32.493
Oh, Pond, uh, even though I know
I can't go back in time,

28:32.536 --> 28:34.713
I realize how much

28:34.756 --> 28:36.976
I hurt you in the past
by not telling you

28:37.019 --> 28:38.325
how important
you were to me

28:38.368 --> 28:39.543
when I had
the chance,

28:39.587 --> 28:41.023
so I've re-created

28:41.067 --> 28:43.460
that night so I can
finally do it right.

28:46.420 --> 28:50.424
Is... is that my bedroom
from middle school?

28:50.467 --> 28:53.470
RIVER: Down to the very
last butterfly clip.

28:53.514 --> 28:57.431
Though I'm very sorry to report
that your Tamagotchi has died.

28:57.474 --> 29:01.435
I know you had a sleepover
with your friends that night,

29:01.478 --> 29:04.394
so I would be so grateful
if you would oblige me

29:04.438 --> 29:05.961
and put on your PJs.

29:07.310 --> 29:10.357
This is insane.
No, I'm not doing this.

29:10.400 --> 29:11.837
Really? Because, uh,

29:11.880 --> 29:14.361
Jemma and Taylor
and Chartreuse

29:14.404 --> 29:16.406
will be so
disappointed.

29:22.543 --> 29:25.067
MAGDA:
Get me out of here!

29:25.111 --> 29:27.417
Let me out now!

29:27.461 --> 29:29.811
I have to go number two.

29:29.855 --> 29:31.508
I'm under strict orders, ma'am.

29:31.552 --> 29:32.771
Petra said you're
a dirty charlatan

29:32.814 --> 29:34.337
and I shouldn't trust
a word you say.

29:34.381 --> 29:35.599
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
That's fair.

29:35.643 --> 29:38.341
MAGDA:
Please, I'm dying.

29:38.385 --> 29:42.215
: My blood...
will be on your hands.

29:53.487 --> 29:54.793
POND:
Wow.

29:54.836 --> 29:56.533
I can't believe you're all here.

29:56.577 --> 29:59.536
Yeah, we thought
maybe you were dying,

29:59.580 --> 30:02.409
but since your mom offered to
put us up at a five-star hotel,

30:02.452 --> 30:04.193
we didn't really
ask questions.

30:04.237 --> 30:06.848
So... Tay Tay,

30:06.892 --> 30:08.371
haven't seen you in forever.

30:08.415 --> 30:12.332
Yeah, not since you
stole my boyfriend.

30:12.375 --> 30:14.377
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Tay Tay was pi-pissed.

30:14.421 --> 30:16.466
Jemma, you still
have braces?

30:16.510 --> 30:18.599
The make-up department
forced me to put these on

30:18.642 --> 30:22.429
for "maximum authenticity."
They really hurt.

30:22.472 --> 30:25.998
ROGELIO :
Gracias.

30:26.041 --> 30:29.001
All art is sacred and fleeting,

30:29.044 --> 30:31.960
so when an actress
steps into a role,

30:32.004 --> 30:34.049
she's transformed,

30:34.093 --> 30:36.225
however briefly, into...

30:37.531 --> 30:39.446
Anyway, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

30:39.489 --> 30:40.447
And the winner

30:40.490 --> 30:43.363
for Outstanding
Lead Actress

30:43.406 --> 30:47.236
in a Limited Series is...
River Fields.

30:47.280 --> 30:49.412
Oh!

30:49.456 --> 30:51.414
RIVER:
Thank you.

30:51.458 --> 30:55.984
You know, I-I don't think
that I would've been prepared

30:56.028 --> 30:59.988
for my starring role
in Plath on Plathhad I not had

31:00.032 --> 31:03.905
a very special person
in my life.

31:05.689 --> 31:07.561
My daughter, Pond.

31:07.604 --> 31:12.522
You know, they say that, um,
a pond needs a river

31:12.566 --> 31:14.046
to sustain it...

31:14.089 --> 31:16.048
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
They do?

31:16.091 --> 31:18.354
But I think
it's the other way around.

31:18.398 --> 31:21.705
Pond, y-you fill me up.

31:21.749 --> 31:23.055
You...

31:23.098 --> 31:27.276
you teach me so much every day.

31:27.320 --> 31:30.323
I would be nothing without you.

31:37.634 --> 31:39.985
And while we can't
go back in time,

31:40.028 --> 31:43.902
I can now say I'm sorry.

31:43.945 --> 31:48.602
I'm sorry that I wasn't there
for you all those years.

31:48.645 --> 31:52.823
I thought my Emmy win
was the highlight of my life,

31:52.867 --> 31:56.610
but reconnecting with you
is the real climax.

31:59.178 --> 32:01.484
This is so crazy.

32:04.009 --> 32:05.488
And sweet.

32:07.447 --> 32:09.710
Oh...

32:15.281 --> 32:16.673
GUARD:
Stop her!

32:28.598 --> 32:29.599
Sakra.

32:32.124 --> 32:34.648
So, we meet again.

32:34.691 --> 32:35.823
What are you up to

32:35.866 --> 32:37.912
this time, Magda?

32:37.956 --> 32:39.609
I'm not up to anything.

32:39.653 --> 32:40.697
I'm calling security.

32:40.741 --> 32:43.526
I would not do that
if I were you.

32:43.570 --> 32:45.702
I know people.

32:45.746 --> 32:48.488
I don't want something
to happen to you again.

32:48.531 --> 32:50.881
Are you threatening me?

32:50.925 --> 32:53.014
It is not a threat.

32:53.058 --> 32:55.060
It is a promise.

33:01.588 --> 33:03.155
I do not get joke.

33:03.198 --> 33:06.549
I got all that on my phone,

33:06.593 --> 33:08.638
so if you don't
leave town forever,

33:08.682 --> 33:09.944
you're going
back to jail.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.599
Or did you forget
that threatening me

33:12.642 --> 33:14.122
is a violation of your parole

33:14.166 --> 33:17.604
and it comes with a mandatory
five-year sentence?

33:17.647 --> 33:19.475
But I am not scared
of you anymore,

33:19.519 --> 33:21.260
because I am
an American now, bitch!

33:23.784 --> 33:26.613
Okay. Okay.

33:26.656 --> 33:28.528
I'll leave.And remember,

33:28.571 --> 33:30.530
if I ever see you around here

33:30.573 --> 33:32.227
ever again,

33:32.271 --> 33:34.534
I'll take this recording
straight to the police.

33:38.929 --> 33:41.236
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Don't delete it, Alba.

33:42.542 --> 33:44.239
OMG.

33:44.283 --> 33:45.849
She finally learned
how to work her phone.

33:47.112 --> 33:49.418
Not working as well...

33:51.681 --> 33:53.248
Our Jane.

33:59.254 --> 34:01.517
Thank you, Abuela. I'm trying
to crack this crime story.

34:01.561 --> 34:03.084
I even prayed about it.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.828
What?

34:18.926 --> 34:21.189
You confronted Magda?

34:25.672 --> 34:27.587
And just like that,
Jane realized

34:27.630 --> 34:29.415
what she needed to do
in her novel,

34:29.458 --> 34:31.721
a way for the crime to climax.

34:31.765 --> 34:33.114
A confrontation. That's it.

34:33.158 --> 34:35.203
Yes. I don't need
to build up the crime.

34:35.247 --> 34:36.987
I need to build up the heroine.

34:37.031 --> 34:38.772
Mm... mwah!

34:38.815 --> 34:41.644
Wow, looks like somebody
had a breakthrough.

34:41.688 --> 34:42.732
A big one, yes.

34:42.776 --> 34:44.343
And I wrote it,
and it feels right

34:44.386 --> 34:45.605
for the book,

34:45.648 --> 34:47.694
and now I think
I need to do it, too.

34:47.737 --> 34:48.999
Do what, too?

34:49.043 --> 34:50.653
Confront Rose.

34:51.959 --> 34:53.961
I want to go see her.

35:01.186 --> 35:03.144
I think I changed my mind.

35:03.188 --> 35:04.754
Oh, good.

35:04.798 --> 35:07.540
I wasn't sure seeing Rose in
person was a good idea anyway.

35:07.583 --> 35:08.932
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, thank God. Me, neither.

35:08.976 --> 35:10.543
I meant I changed my mind
about the dress.

35:10.586 --> 35:11.805
I think I'd feel
more comfortable

35:11.848 --> 35:13.502
confronting Rose in pants.

35:13.546 --> 35:15.548
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh.

35:15.591 --> 35:18.159
Got it. Good choice.No.

35:18.203 --> 35:20.161
Wh-What do you mean you're not
sure it's a great idea?

35:20.205 --> 35:21.554
And why didn't you say anything
last night?

35:21.597 --> 35:24.383
I-I... I'm just worried
that seeing her in person

35:24.426 --> 35:26.428
might upset you even more.

35:26.472 --> 35:28.082
But I was just trying
to be supportive,

35:28.126 --> 35:30.171
and you were so determined.

35:30.215 --> 35:33.305
I am determined, because I can't

35:33.348 --> 35:35.524
keep letting Rose have
this power over me.

35:35.568 --> 35:39.093
If I can just see her behind
bars and say my piece to her,

35:39.137 --> 35:41.313
I really think
I'll be able to move on.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.317
I need to do this.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.319
I just need to do this in pants.

35:47.362 --> 35:49.190
MAGDA:
Okay.

35:49.234 --> 35:50.844
Okay.

35:50.887 --> 35:52.237
I accept your deal.

35:52.280 --> 35:53.760
5,000 a month.

35:53.803 --> 35:55.196
Oh, Mother, you escaped.

35:55.240 --> 35:58.112
Good for you.
But you're too late.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.854
I closed the deal
with Clarissa last night.

36:00.897 --> 36:03.813
So your stock is
bottoming out.

36:03.857 --> 36:05.424
I'll give you
500 a month

36:05.467 --> 36:07.339
to leave and never come back.

36:07.382 --> 36:08.905
500 a...

36:11.691 --> 36:15.347
Uh, very generous.

36:15.390 --> 36:16.696
I will take it.

36:17.958 --> 36:19.655
I leave town tonight.

36:19.699 --> 36:21.701
Where will you go?

36:21.744 --> 36:24.573
To live with your other twin.

36:24.617 --> 36:26.401
The triplet.

36:27.576 --> 36:29.535
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wait. Truth or fiction?

36:29.578 --> 36:32.277
Don't try to get
in my head, Mother.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.192
Get out of here.

36:43.462 --> 36:45.290
XIOMARA:
What a day.

36:45.333 --> 36:47.117
I don't know
what I was nervous about.

36:47.161 --> 36:48.467
Nursing school was great.

36:48.510 --> 36:50.817
I was totally prepared
from all the reading I'd done,

36:50.860 --> 36:53.254
and there were a lot
of older students like me,

36:53.298 --> 36:54.690
so I didn't feel out of place.

36:54.734 --> 36:56.997
I love seeing you
so happy, Xiomara.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.303
I am.

37:00.348 --> 37:02.350
Ah. River!

37:02.394 --> 37:07.094
How is my talented
costar slash super-mother?

37:07.137 --> 37:08.574
Ah, I can't
thank you enough, Rogelio.

37:08.617 --> 37:10.619
You truly are
the daughter whisperer.

37:10.663 --> 37:12.230
Oh, stop.

37:12.273 --> 37:15.798
I just did
what any caring, handsome

37:15.842 --> 37:17.409
and extremely brilliant person
would do.

37:17.452 --> 37:19.411
Well,

37:19.454 --> 37:21.674
thanks to you, Pond and I have
really turned things around.

37:21.717 --> 37:23.458
I'm so happy for you.

37:23.502 --> 37:26.331
Does this mean
that the show is back on?

37:26.374 --> 37:27.897
It absolutely is.

37:27.941 --> 37:29.377
Oh, thank God.

37:29.421 --> 37:31.858
But we're moving it to New York.

37:31.901 --> 37:33.860
Wait, what?

37:33.903 --> 37:37.080
Pond really wants to move
back home, and like you said,

37:37.124 --> 37:38.691
I have to put family first.

37:38.734 --> 37:40.301
And luckily,

37:40.345 --> 37:43.261
my contract says I can move
the show wherever I want,

37:43.304 --> 37:44.827
and I want this.

37:44.871 --> 37:46.438
For my family.

37:49.876 --> 37:53.096
But, uh, what about my family?

37:53.140 --> 37:56.317
I-I know it's going to be
a tough decision for you.

37:56.361 --> 37:59.538
I'd hate to recast.

38:08.242 --> 38:10.549
I'm so nervous.

38:10.592 --> 38:12.333
I know.

38:12.377 --> 38:14.814
But you can do this.
And...

38:14.857 --> 38:16.424
if you change your mind,
that's okay, too.

38:16.468 --> 38:19.645
We can turn around,
separate life from art.

38:19.688 --> 38:21.429
I can't.

38:21.473 --> 38:24.040
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
It's hard, for the record,

38:24.084 --> 38:26.347
to keep them from colliding.

38:26.391 --> 38:27.348
Whoa.

38:27.392 --> 38:29.002
What the hell?

38:30.525 --> 38:32.658
Which brings us to our climax.

38:32.701 --> 38:37.663
Guard, uh, there's something
in here I think you should see.

38:41.362 --> 38:43.799
And what is all too real,
relatively.

38:43.843 --> 38:46.236
I think you should
probably call this in.

38:46.280 --> 38:48.456
I seem to be losing
a lot of blood.

38:49.631 --> 38:50.589
Hurry up and grab your bag.

38:50.632 --> 38:51.894
Now?

39:15.701 --> 39:18.181
Okay. Now, run.

39:23.709 --> 39:25.885
Police! Stop!Freeze!

39:25.928 --> 39:27.930
Get her!Stop! Stop them!

39:51.650 --> 39:53.216
I'm here to see Rose.

39:53.260 --> 39:54.522
Dennis, what are
you doing here?

39:54.566 --> 39:55.915
What's going on?

39:55.958 --> 39:57.438
I'm afraid you can't see her.

39:57.482 --> 39:58.961
What? Why?

39:59.005 --> 40:00.659
DENNIS:
Rose escaped.

40:07.492 --> 40:08.667
Luisa.

40:09.755 --> 40:10.973
Finally.

40:12.105 --> 40:13.628
Rose escaped?
But we knew

40:13.672 --> 40:15.064
she was gonna try
because of Luisa.

40:15.108 --> 40:16.065
RAFAEL:
Of course

40:16.109 --> 40:17.284
she was involved.

40:17.327 --> 40:19.373
No, it's not what you think.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.549
We're gonna spend the rest
of our lives together, baby,

40:21.593 --> 40:25.205
somewhere where no one
can ever find us.

40:30.776 --> 40:32.473
You're under arrest.DENNIS:
Luisa's actually

40:32.517 --> 40:33.648
been working with us
for months.

40:33.692 --> 40:35.084
Luisa betrayed me?

40:35.128 --> 40:36.477
I had no idea. I swear.

40:36.521 --> 40:37.913
OFFICER: Police!DENNIS: Because of Luisa,

40:37.957 --> 40:40.089
we were able to uncover
Rose's escape plan,

40:40.133 --> 40:41.569
cut off her supply of funds

40:41.613 --> 40:44.180
and send in the team
to capture her.

40:44.224 --> 40:46.226
She couldn't tell you the truth
for your own safety.

40:46.269 --> 40:49.272
So you guys caught her, and
she'll be back in prison.

40:49.316 --> 40:50.491
Unfortunately, things didn't

40:50.535 --> 40:51.753
go as planned.

40:52.798 --> 40:54.364
Sorry.

41:05.506 --> 41:08.161
DENNIS:
And she escaped again.

41:09.945 --> 41:11.599
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know.

41:11.643 --> 41:14.036
Talk about scary stuff.
