00:36.691 --> 00:38.790
'German aircraft carried out
a number of attacks

00:38.825 --> 00:40.365
'on Great Britain last night.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.555
'The raids,
which lasted for several hours,

00:42.590 --> 00:44.795
'were scattered over many
parts of the country.

00:44.830 --> 00:47.000
'And the enemy aircraft has been...
AIR- RAID SIREN

00:47.035 --> 00:48.875
'.. reported over towns on
the south coast,

00:48.910 --> 00:51.510
'the west of England, the North
Midlands and the north-west,

00:51.545 --> 00:53.353
'as well as over the London area. '

00:59.640 --> 01:02.000
He does nothing but cry.
Are they keeping him in?

01:02.035 --> 01:03.235
They wouldn't let me stay.

01:03.270 --> 01:05.555
The doctor said
I seemed to make matters worse.

01:05.590 --> 01:07.840
I should never have taken him
to the hospital.

01:07.875 --> 01:09.285
I don't know what came over me.

01:09.320 --> 01:11.920
I should have brought him
back here where he belongs.

01:11.955 --> 01:13.920
Why is his coat on the floor?
And his hat?

01:13.955 --> 01:15.675
Drying out. They're wet through.

01:15.710 --> 01:17.920
Well, how did he come to
be in such a state, Norman?

01:17.955 --> 01:19.565
When you telephoned, I thought

01:19.600 --> 01:21.720
at first that he'd been hurt
in the air raid. Oh, no.

01:21.755 --> 01:23.406
Or had an accident.
Oh, no, not an accident.

01:23.441 --> 01:26.200
No, I know because they said there
was no sign of physical injury.

01:26.235 --> 01:28.610
Your Ladyship. He's in a state
of collapse. Yes, I know.

01:28.645 --> 01:30.005
Well, how did he get like that?

01:30.040 --> 01:33.190
Your Ladyship... What happened to
him? Sit down. Please, sit down.

01:33.225 --> 01:34.475
We must remain calm.

01:34.510 --> 01:36.790
The doctor said it must have been
coming on for weeks.

01:36.825 --> 01:39.232
Oh, if not longer.
Well, I didn't see him this morning.

01:39.267 --> 01:41.605
He left the digs before I woke.
Where was he all day?

01:41.640 --> 01:45.470
Where did you find him? Well, what
happened was this, Your Ladyship.

01:45.505 --> 01:48.390
After the last "all clear" sounded,
I went into Market Square

01:48.425 --> 01:50.925
just as dusk was coming on.

01:50.960 --> 01:54.375
Peculiar light, ever so yellowish.

01:54.410 --> 01:57.640
I'd hoped to find a packet or two
of Brown & Polson's cornflour,

01:57.675 --> 02:01.165
since our supplies are rather low.

02:01.200 --> 02:05.600
So I was asking at this stall
and that's when I heard his voice.

02:05.635 --> 02:06.965
Whose voice?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.513
Sir's, of course.

02:10.639 --> 02:13.565
He was taking off his overcoat -
in this weather!

02:13.600 --> 02:16.455
"God help the man who stops me,"
he shouted, and then

02:16.490 --> 02:20.790
he threw the coat to the ground just
like King Lear in the storm scene.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.950
Look at it. I don't know
that I'll ever get it clean.

02:24.985 --> 02:28.190
And he was so proud of it,
do you remember...?

02:28.225 --> 02:30.571
Oh, no, perhaps it
was before your time.

02:30.606 --> 02:32.516
The first Canadian tour, Toronto.

02:36.691 --> 02:38.920
What happened after
he took off his coat?

02:38.955 --> 02:40.000
Started on the hat!

02:41.520 --> 02:45.760
Dunn's, Piccadilly, only a year ago,
down on the coat it went and

02:45.795 --> 02:50.000
he jumped on it, he stamped on his
hat, viciously stamped on his hat.

02:50.035 --> 02:51.205
Well, you can see.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.555
Then he lifted his arms in the air
like he does to convey

02:53.590 --> 02:57.560
sterility into Goneril's womb, "How
much further do you want me to go?"

02:59.950 --> 03:02.555
His fingers were all of a fidget,
undoing his jacket,

03:02.590 --> 03:06.480
loosening his collar and tie,
tearing at the buttons of his shirt.

03:06.515 --> 03:08.015
Were there many people about?

03:08.050 --> 03:11.815
A small crowd.
That's why I ran to him.

03:11.850 --> 03:14.920
I didn't want him to stand there
looking ridiculous

03:14.955 --> 03:17.165
with people all around, sniggering.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.920
Did he see you?
Did he know who you were?

03:18.955 --> 03:20.922
I didn't wait to find out.

03:22.720 --> 03:24.406
I just took his hand and I said,

03:24.441 --> 03:27.780
"Good evening, Sir, shouldn't
we be getting to the theatre?"

03:27.815 --> 03:31.120
in my best nanny voice, the one
I use when he's being wayward.

03:31.155 --> 03:34.115
He paid no attention.
He was shivering.

03:34.150 --> 03:36.795
You shouldn't have let the public
see him like that.

03:36.830 --> 03:39.406
It's easy to be wise after
the event, if you don't mind

03:39.441 --> 03:42.330
my saying so, Your Ladyship,
but I tried to spirit him away,

03:42.365 --> 03:45.280
not easy with a man
of his proportions.

03:45.315 --> 03:47.157
Only, just then...

03:48.480 --> 03:50.375
.. a woman approached,

03:50.410 --> 03:53.400
quite old, wearing bombazine
under a tweed coat

03:53.435 --> 03:55.406
but perfectly respectable.

03:55.441 --> 03:58.590
She'd picked up his clothes
and wanted to help him dress.

03:58.625 --> 04:01.315
And Sir said to the lady,

04:01.350 --> 04:07.240
"Thank you, my dear,
but Norman usually helps me.

04:07.275 --> 04:09.311
"I'd be lost without Norman,"
and I thought,

04:09.346 --> 04:10.915
"Well, this is your cue, ducky,"

04:10.950 --> 04:14.555
so I said,
"I'm Norman, I'm his dresser. "

04:14.590 --> 04:18.490
And the woman, she had her hair in
curlers, she took his hand,

04:18.524 --> 04:19.656
she kissed it, and she said,

04:19.690 --> 04:21.807
"You was lovely in
The Corsican Brothers. "

04:23.120 --> 04:25.571
He looked at her for a long time,
then he smiled sweetly,

04:25.606 --> 04:28.210
you know the way he does
when he's wanting to charm?

04:28.245 --> 04:30.867
"Thank you, my dear,
but you must excuse me.

04:30.902 --> 04:33.490
"I have to make an exit,"
and he ran off.

04:33.525 --> 04:35.375
He said, "I have to make an exit"?

04:35.410 --> 04:39.130
Well, of course, I followed him,
fearing the worst.

04:39.165 --> 04:41.195
I didn't know he could run so fast.

04:41.230 --> 04:43.840
I just followed this trail of
discarded clothing, the jacket,

04:43.875 --> 04:45.325
the waistcoat, and I thought,

04:45.360 --> 04:48.480
"We can't have Sir doing a
striptease round town. "

04:48.515 --> 04:51.600
But then I found him.
Leaning up against a lamppost.

04:51.635 --> 04:53.136
Weeping. Where?

04:55.050 --> 04:56.995
Outside the Kardomah.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.850
Without a word,
hardly knowing what I was doing,

04:59.885 --> 05:01.090
I led him to the hospital.

05:02.441 --> 05:05.775
The sister didn't recognise him,

05:05.810 --> 05:09.720
although later she said she'd
seen him last night as Othello.

05:09.755 --> 05:13.812
A doctor was summoned,
short, bald, bespectacled,

05:13.847 --> 05:17.718
and I was excluded
by the drawing of screens.

05:17.753 --> 05:21.555
And then you telephoned me.
No, I waited.

05:21.590 --> 05:25.185
I lurked, as Edgar says,
and I heard the doctor whisper,

05:25.220 --> 05:28.780
"This man is exhausted.
This man is in a state of collapse. "

05:28.815 --> 05:31.030
And that's how it happened.

05:48.930 --> 05:51.130
He did nothing but cry.

05:51.165 --> 05:52.645
Yes, you said.

05:52.680 --> 05:55.600
I left him lying on top of the bed,
still in his clothes, crying,

05:55.635 --> 05:58.880
no, weeping, as though he'd lost
control, had no choice,

05:58.915 --> 06:00.960
wept and wept, floodgates.

06:00.995 --> 06:02.745
What are we to do?

06:02.780 --> 06:05.780
In an hour there will be
an audience in this theatre

06:05.815 --> 06:07.400
hoping to see him as King Lear.

06:07.435 --> 06:09.286
What AM I to do?

06:09.321 --> 06:11.485
Well, don't upset
yourself, for a start.

06:11.520 --> 06:14.409
Well, I've never had to make this
sort of decision before.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.815
Any sort of decision before.

06:16.850 --> 06:19.311
As soon as I came out
of the hospital I telephoned Madge

06:19.346 --> 06:21.355
and asked her to meet me
here as soon as possible.

06:21.390 --> 06:23.810
She'll know what to do.
Oh, yes, Madge'll know what to do.

06:23.845 --> 06:25.850
She won't upset herself,
that's for certain.

06:25.885 --> 06:28.127
No, Madge will be ever so sensible.

06:28.162 --> 06:30.369
I suppose stage managers have to be.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.565
I had a friend once,

06:33.600 --> 06:38.650
had been a vicar before falling from
the pulpit and landing on the stage.

06:38.685 --> 06:41.380
Ever so good as an ugly sister.
To the manner born.

06:42.441 --> 06:44.454
His wife didn't upset easily.

06:46.240 --> 06:49.125
Just as well, I suppose,
all things considered.

06:49.160 --> 06:53.365
Madge reminds me of her.
Cold, businesslike, boring.

06:53.400 --> 06:56.760
The doctor took me into a little
room littered with enamel dishes

06:56.795 --> 06:58.850
full of blood-stained bandages.

06:58.885 --> 07:00.536
The smell made me faint.

07:00.571 --> 07:03.920
He asked me
about his behaviour in recent days.

07:03.955 --> 07:06.215
Had I noticed anything untoward?

07:06.250 --> 07:09.139
And what did you say?
If you don't mind my asking.

07:11.400 --> 07:12.571
I lied.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.871
I said he'd been perfectly normal.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.885
I don't want to appear neglectful.

07:19.920 --> 07:22.430
I should have been more vigilant.

07:22.465 --> 07:24.940
Only last night I woke...

07:24.975 --> 07:26.601
Is that Madge? No, it's Irene.

07:28.530 --> 07:31.990
You were saying?
Last night you woke.

07:32.025 --> 07:35.032
He was looking at me. He was naked.

07:35.067 --> 07:38.005
It was bitter cold,
he was shivering.

07:38.040 --> 07:42.520
He said, "Thank you for watching
over me but don't worry.

07:42.555 --> 07:44.205
"Just go on looking after me.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.947
"I have the feeling
I may do something violent. "

07:48.220 --> 07:49.185
Talk about untoward.

07:49.220 --> 07:51.451
I'm glad you didn't
tell the doctors that,

07:51.486 --> 07:53.565
they'd have locked him up for good.

07:53.600 --> 07:56.520
Last night, after Othello,
he asked me,

07:56.555 --> 07:58.177
"What do we play tomorrow, Norman?"

07:58.212 --> 07:59.765
I told him King Lear and he said,

07:59.800 --> 08:03.120
"Then I shall wake with
the storm clouds over my head. "

08:03.155 --> 08:04.725
I should have made him rest.

08:04.760 --> 08:08.960
The doctor said he'd come to the end
of his rope and found it frayed.

08:08.995 --> 08:11.090
So would anyone that had to
put up with

08:11.125 --> 08:13.175
what he's had to put up with.

08:13.210 --> 08:15.410
You should've told
the doctor about the troubles.

08:15.445 --> 08:17.925
No. Civilians never understand.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.441
I could kick myself for taking him
to the hospital.

08:20.476 --> 08:22.000
It was the right thing to do.

08:22.035 --> 08:25.310
I hope so. Doctors.

08:26.810 --> 08:30.050
Can you imagine trying to explain to
a doctor what Sir's been through?

08:30.085 --> 08:33.365
"Well, you see, doctor,
he's been trying to recruit actors

08:33.400 --> 08:37.039
"for his Shakespeare company and
all the able-bodied and best ones

08:37.075 --> 08:40.169
"are in uniform, and the theatres
are bombed

08:40.205 --> 08:41.929
"as soon as you book them. "

08:41.965 --> 08:43.054
Doctors.

08:43.090 --> 08:45.650
He'd have had his hypodermic
rampant before you could say

08:45.685 --> 08:46.685
As You Like It.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.615
Madge is right.

08:50.650 --> 08:53.025
There is no alternative.

08:53.060 --> 08:55.365
We'll have to cancel.

08:55.400 --> 08:58.380
Oh, no, oh, Your Ladyship, no,
cancellation's ever so drastic.

08:58.415 --> 08:59.505
He's ill.

08:59.540 --> 09:02.205
There's no crime in being ill,
it's not high treason,

09:02.240 --> 09:06.100
it's not a capital offence, it's not
desertion in the face of the enemy.

09:06.135 --> 09:09.150
He's not himself. He can't work.
Will the world stop turning?

09:09.185 --> 09:10.546
Will the Nazis overrun England?

09:10.581 --> 09:13.410
One Lear more or less in the world
won't make any difference.

09:13.445 --> 09:15.485
Sir always believes it will.

09:15.520 --> 09:18.125
Who really cares
whether he acts or not?

09:22.690 --> 09:24.942
I never imagined it would
end like this.

09:27.530 --> 09:30.055
I've always thought
he was indestructible.

09:31.760 --> 09:33.930
All the years we've been together.

09:33.965 --> 09:35.170
Feels like a lifetime.

09:36.730 --> 09:38.573
Even longer, he and I.

09:41.620 --> 09:44.135
It'll be the first time
we've ever cancelled.

09:44.170 --> 09:46.650
Look, I want to go to the hospital.
No, Norman.

09:46.685 --> 09:48.107
I want to sit with him,
be with him

09:48.142 --> 09:49.495
and try to give him some comfort.

09:49.530 --> 09:52.880
I can usually make him smile.
Maybe when he sees me...

09:52.915 --> 09:54.484
They wouldn't even let me stay.

10:09.890 --> 10:13.461
I wish I could remember the name of
the girl who got me into all this.

10:13.496 --> 10:17.920
Motherly type, she was,
small parts, play as cast.

10:17.955 --> 10:19.915
I can see her face clearly.

10:19.950 --> 10:23.065
I can see her standing there,
on platform two at Crewe,

10:23.100 --> 10:27.080
a Sunday, I was on platform four.
" Norman," she called.

10:27.115 --> 10:31.025
We'd been together in Outward Bound,
the number three tour,

10:31.060 --> 10:36.600
helped with the wardrobe I did, and
understudied Scrubby, the steward.

10:36.635 --> 10:39.380
That's all aboard a ship, you know.
It's a lovely first act.

10:39.415 --> 10:41.426
"We're all dead, aren't we?"

10:41.461 --> 10:46.905
And I say, "Yes, sir,
we're all dead. Quite dead. "

10:46.940 --> 10:51.090
And he says, "How long have you
been... you been...? Oh, you know. "

10:51.125 --> 10:54.207
"Me? Oh, I was lost young. "

10:55.730 --> 10:59.461
And then he says,
"Where... where are we sailing for?"

10:59.496 --> 11:03.170
And I say, "Heaven, sir.
And hell, too.

11:04.280 --> 11:06.032
"It's the same place, you see. "

11:09.160 --> 11:11.406
Lovely. Well,

11:11.441 --> 11:15.045
to cut a short story shorter,
Sir wanted help in the wardrobe

11:15.080 --> 11:18.676
and someone to assist generally
but, mainly, with the storm in Lear.

11:18.711 --> 11:21.110
I've told you this before,
haven't I?

11:23.076 --> 11:24.761
Put me on the timpani, he did.

11:24.796 --> 11:27.361
And on the first night, after
the storm, while he was waiting

11:27.396 --> 11:32.636
to go on for, "No, they cannot touch
me for coining", he called me over.

11:32.671 --> 11:34.071
My knees were jelly.

11:34.106 --> 11:36.802
"Were you on the timpani tonight?"

11:38.936 --> 11:42.246
I said, "Yes, sir," fearing
the worst. "Thank you," he said.

11:43.726 --> 11:45.921
"You are an artist. "

11:52.756 --> 11:54.166
My father was exactly the same.

11:56.036 --> 11:57.890
Always exaggerated his illnesses.

12:00.596 --> 12:03.836
That's why I thought it was not
very serious, I thought...

12:08.756 --> 12:10.121
Any further developments?

12:10.156 --> 12:12.286
We had better see
the theatre manager.

12:12.321 --> 12:14.211
Perhaps you ought to come with me.

12:14.246 --> 12:16.317
Oh, no, Your Ladyship, please,
let's take our time,

12:16.352 --> 12:18.412
let's not rush things.
There's no alternative.

12:18.447 --> 12:21.516
Madge is right, we can't play
King Lear without the King.

12:21.551 --> 12:23.491
We have to make a decision.

12:23.526 --> 12:27.126
Forgive me, Your Ladyship, it's not
a decision you have to make,

12:27.161 --> 12:29.131
it's the right decision.

12:29.166 --> 12:33.486
I had a friend, in a very low state,
he was, ever so fragile,

12:33.521 --> 12:35.131
a pain to be with.

12:35.166 --> 12:37.166
You weren't safe from him
on top of a bus.

12:37.201 --> 12:38.651
If he happened to sit beside you,

12:38.686 --> 12:42.756
he'd tell you the ABC of unhappiness
between request stops.

12:42.791 --> 12:44.826
Someone close to him, his mother,
I believe,

12:44.861 --> 12:46.561
although it was never proved,

12:46.596 --> 12:48.691
understandably upset,
made a decision.

12:48.726 --> 12:52.447
"A little rest", she said,
"with others similarly off-centre,

12:52.482 --> 12:57.156
"in Colwyn Bay", never a good date,
not in February,

12:57.191 --> 13:00.836
wrapped in a grey rug,
gazing at a grey sea.

13:00.871 --> 13:02.312
Talk about bleak.

13:02.347 --> 13:05.156
Mother-dear made a decision
but it was the wrong decision.

13:05.191 --> 13:07.931
And my friend never acted again.
We have to face the facts.

13:07.966 --> 13:11.556
I've never done that in my life, Your Ladyship,
and I don't see why I should start now.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.162
I just like things to be lovely.

13:13.197 --> 13:15.106
Yes, but things aren't lovely,
Norman.

13:15.141 --> 13:16.721
They aren't if you face facts.

13:16.756 --> 13:19.726
Face the facts, it's facing
the company I worry about.

13:19.761 --> 13:21.521
I'll be in Madge's office
if I'm wanted.

13:21.556 --> 13:24.187
Don't decide yet, Your Ladyship,
let me go to the hospital,

13:24.222 --> 13:26.491
let me see how he is,
you never know.

13:26.526 --> 13:31.452
I do know. I realise now that I've
witnessed a slow running down.

13:32.686 --> 13:35.529
I've heard the hiss of air escaping.

13:35.564 --> 13:38.372
Norman! Norman!

13:50.086 --> 13:52.122
Good evening, Sir.

13:53.876 --> 13:57.036
Good evening, Norman.
Good evening, Pussy.

13:57.071 --> 13:58.871
Bonzo, why are you here?

13:58.906 --> 14:02.266
Well, my name is on the door.
Did the doctors say you could leave?

14:02.301 --> 14:03.641
Doctors?

14:03.676 --> 14:06.131
Executioners.

14:06.166 --> 14:08.051
Do you know what he told me?

14:08.086 --> 14:12.261
A short, bald butcher.
Il Duce in a white coat.

14:13.467 --> 14:16.796
When a doctor tells you
you need rest, you can be certain

14:16.831 --> 14:20.126
he has not the slightest
idea of what is wrong with you.

14:20.161 --> 14:22.461
I discharged myself.

14:22.496 --> 14:25.496
Telephone the hospital.
Do not telephone the hospital!

14:25.531 --> 14:27.521
Norman, will you leave us, please?

14:27.556 --> 14:30.468
I'll see Madge and tell her
there is an alternative.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.452
Shh-shh!

14:37.636 --> 14:39.046
You're fit for nothing.

14:40.246 --> 14:41.941
Please, Pussy, don't.

14:43.046 --> 14:47.116
Cancel the performance.
Can't, mustn't, won't.

14:47.151 --> 14:48.986
Then take the consequences.

14:49.021 --> 14:50.771
When have I not?

14:50.806 --> 14:53.211
Where have you been all day?

14:53.246 --> 14:55.396
Don't tell me
you found a brothel in this town.

14:58.806 --> 15:00.771
I can't remember all I've done.

15:00.806 --> 15:04.136
I know towards the evening
I was being pursued

15:04.171 --> 15:07.071
but I couldn't see who
the villains were.

15:07.106 --> 15:11.366
Then the air-raid warning went.
I refused to take shelter.

15:11.401 --> 15:15.882
Wherever I went,
I seemed to hear a woman crying.

15:18.116 --> 15:19.312
Then, suddenly,

15:19.347 --> 15:22.079
I had a clear image of my father

15:22.114 --> 15:24.812
on the beach near Lowestoft.

15:27.416 --> 15:28.860
"An actor?" he said, "Never. "

15:30.166 --> 15:32.214
"You will be a boat builder like me. "

15:35.486 --> 15:37.863
But I defied him and lost his love.

15:39.186 --> 15:42.036
Father preferred people to cower.

15:42.071 --> 15:44.851
But I had to chart my own course.

15:44.886 --> 15:50.337
I decide when I'm ready
for the scrapyard. Not you. I.

15:50.372 --> 15:52.225
No-one else. I.

15:59.676 --> 16:01.576
The woman you heard crying was me.

16:03.972 --> 16:06.545
Norman! Sir.
I want you by me, Norman.

16:06.580 --> 16:09.083
Yes, sir. Don't leave my side,
Norman.

16:09.118 --> 16:11.433
No, sir. I shall need help, Norman.
Yes, sir. Madge.

16:11.468 --> 16:13.748
You speak to him.
He doesn't listen to a word I say.

16:13.783 --> 16:15.184
He's obviously incapable.

16:15.219 --> 16:17.758
You look exhausted.
That's what I call tact.

16:17.793 --> 16:20.263
Are you sure you're able to
go on tonight?

16:20.298 --> 16:23.023
How long have you been with me?
Longer than anyone else.

16:23.058 --> 16:26.658
Have I ever missed a performance?
No, but then you've never been ill.

16:26.693 --> 16:28.184
I only want what's best for you.

16:28.219 --> 16:31.138
What's best for Sir is that
he's allowed to get ready.

16:31.173 --> 16:32.742
Ready, yes, I must get ready.

16:38.319 --> 16:40.529
Ready for what?

16:40.564 --> 16:43.837
If you'll excuse me, Your Ladyship,
shouldn't you be getting ready too?

16:43.872 --> 16:48.557
I can't bear to see him like that.
Then best to leave us.

16:48.592 --> 16:50.627
I've had experience of these things.

16:51.927 --> 16:53.849
I know what has to be done.

16:54.997 --> 16:57.340
Imagine waking to that
night after night.

17:02.407 --> 17:04.125
SHE CHUCKLES

17:20.166 --> 17:23.477
Right, shall we begin
at the beginning? Good evening, Sir.

17:26.817 --> 17:32.257
"Good evening, Norman. "
And how are you this evening, Sir?

17:32.292 --> 17:36.567
"A little tearful, I'm afraid.
And you, Norman?"

17:36.602 --> 17:40.932
Oh, I'm very well, thank you.

17:40.967 --> 17:46.417
I've had ever such a quiet day,
just ironing your costumes,

17:46.452 --> 17:50.224
cleaning your wig and beard,
washing your undies.

17:50.259 --> 17:53.997
And what have you been up to, Sir,
if I may ask?

17:54.032 --> 17:56.293
"Oh, I've been jumping on my hat,
Norman. "

17:56.328 --> 18:00.357
Have you? Well, that's an odd thing
to do. May one ask why?

18:00.392 --> 18:01.932
"Why what, Norman?"

18:01.967 --> 18:05.130
Why have we been jumping
on our hat, Sir?

18:07.627 --> 18:09.242
SIR GRUMBLES

18:09.277 --> 18:11.932
Shall we play I -Spy?

18:11.967 --> 18:16.537
I spy with my little eye something
beginning with...

18:16.572 --> 18:17.504
A.

18:19.007 --> 18:21.287
I know you won't guess,
so I'll tell you.

18:21.322 --> 18:23.050
A is for actor.

18:24.117 --> 18:28.847
And actors have to work, and actors
have to put on their make-up

18:28.882 --> 18:33.569
and change their frocks and then,
of course, actors have to act.

18:33.604 --> 18:38.257
Good lord. Zounds, madam,
where dost thou get this knowledge?

18:38.292 --> 18:42.353
From a baboon, sir,
that wandered wild in Eden.

18:46.967 --> 18:49.532
Or words to that effect.

18:49.567 --> 18:52.257
There's less than an hour to go
and you usually want more.

18:52.292 --> 18:54.134
So, come on, shall we make a start?

18:55.617 --> 18:59.929
Yes, it's me, Norman,
the one with the soulful eyes.

19:07.287 --> 19:09.492
There.

19:09.527 --> 19:12.143
Drink up. It's tea, not rat poison.

19:16.110 --> 19:19.967
There you go, that's better,
isn't it? Isn't it?

19:21.550 --> 19:23.063
Would you like a biccie?

19:24.470 --> 19:28.420
I saved some from the mayor's
reception in Bridlington.

19:28.455 --> 19:30.585
No?

19:30.620 --> 19:33.850
Would you like one, Norman?
Ooh, I say.

19:33.885 --> 19:36.455
Thank you, I will.

19:41.230 --> 19:43.980
If you don't mind my saying so, Sir,
there seems little point

19:44.015 --> 19:47.163
in discharging yourself
from hospital and then coming to

19:47.198 --> 19:50.311
sit here like Niobe prior
to being turned into stone.

19:50.346 --> 19:53.530
So, shall we make a start?

19:55.830 --> 19:59.230
No, no, don't do that.
That's what I'm here for.

19:59.265 --> 20:01.516
HE SOBS
Ohh!

20:03.140 --> 20:05.711
Oh, I know how it feels.

20:07.020 --> 20:10.375
I had a friend,

20:10.410 --> 20:13.065
worse than you, he was,

20:13.100 --> 20:16.780
and all they ever wanted to do
with him was put him away.

20:16.815 --> 20:19.950
And no-one should have to
go through that.

20:19.985 --> 20:22.156
That's what my friend said.

20:22.191 --> 20:25.026
You know they'll send you
to Colwyn Bay

20:25.061 --> 20:27.985
and you never do any
business in Colwyn Bay.

20:30.181 --> 20:34.580
And guess what got my friend well?
Sounds silly this.

20:34.615 --> 20:37.075
An offer of work.

20:37.110 --> 20:40.819
Can you understudy Scrubby?
Outward Bound, start Monday.

20:41.890 --> 20:46.390
He discharged himself, just like
you, my friend did, took the train

20:46.425 --> 20:50.041
up to London, found digs
in Brixton and never looked back.

20:50.076 --> 20:53.120
What do you make of that?
An offer of work.

20:53.155 --> 20:55.520
It meant that someone...

20:57.320 --> 20:58.617
.. was thinking of him.

21:00.330 --> 21:01.820
It was ever such a comfort.

21:04.650 --> 21:06.760
And here's something
to cheer you up.

21:06.795 --> 21:08.635
A full house tonight.

21:08.670 --> 21:12.356
People thinking of you,
wanting to see you act.

21:12.391 --> 21:16.042
Really? A full house?
Now, shall we make a start?

21:18.960 --> 21:21.415
What play is it tonight?
King Lear, Sir.

21:21.450 --> 21:22.780
That's impossible.

21:22.815 --> 21:25.610
Oh, thank you.
Oh, that's nice, isn't it(?!)

21:25.645 --> 21:29.450
People paying good money to see you
and you say "impossible".

21:29.485 --> 21:33.255
Very nice indeed(!) I don't think.
I don't want to be seen.

21:33.290 --> 21:34.410
Well, that's difficult

21:34.445 --> 21:37.365
when you're playing King Lear
with the lighting you use.

21:37.400 --> 21:38.830
I don't want to see her ladyship.

21:38.865 --> 21:42.255
Oh, well, even more difficult
when she's playing your daughter.

21:42.290 --> 21:45.695
You saw her a moment ago.
You were alone together.

21:45.730 --> 21:46.855
Were we?

21:50.775 --> 21:53.285
What play is it tonight?

21:53.320 --> 21:54.286
King Lear, Sir.

21:56.375 --> 21:57.820
Madge was wrong.

21:57.855 --> 21:59.470
Yes, well, she often is.

21:59.505 --> 22:01.051
I have been ill before this.

22:01.086 --> 22:03.065
Did you ever see me in
The Corsican Brothers?

22:03.100 --> 22:05.517
Ah, no. Alas, sir, before my time.

22:05.552 --> 22:07.900
I went on with
double pneumonia then.

22:07.935 --> 22:10.535
Apt when you're playing
the Corsican brothers.

22:10.570 --> 22:13.135
I'd rather have
double pneumonia than this.

22:13.170 --> 22:14.980
Than what?

22:15.015 --> 22:17.735
What prevents me from packing up
and going home?

22:17.770 --> 22:20.465
Why am I here
when I should be asleep?

22:23.425 --> 22:27.270
Wasn't that a strange light
in Market Square this evening?

22:29.505 --> 22:32.540
I don't remember
being in Market Square.

22:32.575 --> 22:36.739
You've been missing whole days.
What do you remember?

22:38.565 --> 22:44.255
Walking, walking, walking. If only
I could find a good, catchy title.

22:44.290 --> 22:47.490
I think My Life a little plain,
don't you?

22:47.525 --> 22:50.295
Still stuck, are we?
No, no. I wrote a little today.

22:50.330 --> 22:51.900
Two or three sides
of an exercise book.

22:51.935 --> 22:54.725
But I can't find a title.
Oh, well, we'll think of something.

22:54.760 --> 22:58.165
See if it's still in my jacket.
And my reading glasses.

22:58.200 --> 23:00.090
I thought I had written today.

23:00.125 --> 23:02.295
No, well, you'll not see
much through those.

23:02.330 --> 23:03.296
Well, look for me.

23:05.485 --> 23:07.110
Is there anything?

23:07.145 --> 23:11.495
Evidently not.
It cannot be Lear again.

23:11.530 --> 23:13.531
Shall we start our make-up?

23:15.005 --> 23:16.900
I'm getting out of here.

23:16.935 --> 23:21.640
I'm not staying in this place
a moment longer.

23:21.675 --> 23:26.311
I am surrounded by vipers,
betrayal on every side.

23:26.346 --> 23:29.605
I am being crushed, the lifeblood
is draining out of me.

23:29.640 --> 23:31.051
The load is too much.

23:31.086 --> 23:36.985
Norman, Norman, if you have any
regard for me, don't listen to him.

23:37.020 --> 23:40.500
Who? Who? More, more, more,
I cannot give any more.

23:40.535 --> 23:43.815
I have nothing more to give.
I want a tranquil senility.

23:43.850 --> 23:44.990
I'm an old man.

23:45.025 --> 23:47.940
I don't want to go on painting
my face night after night

23:47.975 --> 23:50.855
after night, dressing up in clothes
that are not my own,

23:50.890 --> 23:53.369
I'm not a child dressing
up for charades.

23:54.605 --> 23:59.655
This is my work, this is
my life's work, I'm an actor.

23:59.690 --> 24:01.620
Who cares if I go out there tonight

24:01.655 --> 24:03.985
or any other night
and shorten my life?

24:04.020 --> 24:05.304
Shorten my life...

24:07.585 --> 24:10.080
I don't care if there's only
three people out front,

24:10.115 --> 24:12.540
or if the audience laughs
when they shouldn't, or don't

24:12.575 --> 24:16.535
when they should, one person, just
one person will know and understand.

24:16.570 --> 24:18.105
And I act for him.

24:19.145 --> 24:21.575
I cannot move that which
cannot be moved.

24:21.610 --> 24:23.672
What are we on about now?

24:23.707 --> 24:25.700
I'm filled inside with stone.

24:25.735 --> 24:29.330
Stone upon stone.
I cannot lift myself.

24:29.365 --> 24:34.390
The weight is too much.
Oh, I know futility when I see it.

24:34.425 --> 24:38.965
I dream at night of unseen hands
driving wooden stakes into my feet.

24:39.000 --> 24:43.505
And the dream is long and graceless.
I awake, sweat-drenched, poisoned.

24:43.540 --> 24:48.615
And the whole day long there is
a burning heat inside of me,

24:48.650 --> 24:52.175
driving all else from my mind.

24:52.210 --> 24:53.870
HE GRUNTS

25:00.015 --> 25:01.300
What did I do today?

25:02.295 --> 25:05.695
You walked. You thought you wrote.

25:05.730 --> 25:08.297
You went into Market Square.

25:08.332 --> 25:10.830
And a woman kissed your hand

25:10.865 --> 25:13.604
and said you were lovely
in The Corsican Brothers.

25:13.639 --> 25:16.343
How do you know all this?
Has someone been talking?

25:17.745 --> 25:20.135
I don't wish to hurry you, Sir.

25:20.170 --> 25:22.570
No, I lie, I do.

25:22.605 --> 25:25.110
I hate the swines. Who?

25:25.145 --> 25:28.455
He's a hard task-master,
he drives me too hard.

25:28.490 --> 25:29.865
I have too much to carry.

25:36.064 --> 25:37.708
(Yes?)

25:37.743 --> 25:40.428
I'd like to see him.
(I'd rather you didn't.)

25:40.463 --> 25:42.643
It's my responsibility to take
the curtain up tonight.

25:42.678 --> 25:43.658
There isn't much time.

25:43.693 --> 25:45.438
(Things have reached
a delicate stage.)

25:45.473 --> 25:47.468
What's all the whispering?
Nothing, nothing.

25:47.503 --> 25:50.463
Has he begun to make-up yet? Not
yet. Do you realise how late it is?

25:50.498 --> 25:52.258
They'll be calling
the half in a moment.

25:52.293 --> 25:55.033
I know how late it is.
SIR HUMS A TUNE LOUDLY

25:55.068 --> 25:57.297
Then on your head be it.

25:59.213 --> 26:00.749
Oh, look! A dressing-gown!

26:02.573 --> 26:05.406
Shall we put it on
and keep ourselves warm?

26:09.133 --> 26:12.738
What does it matter where you were
or what you did today?

26:12.773 --> 26:16.343
You're here in the theatre,
safe and sound, where you belong.

26:16.378 --> 26:18.773
Another full house. Lovely.

26:18.808 --> 26:20.899
Really? A full house?

26:20.934 --> 26:22.834
They'll be standing in the gods.

26:24.663 --> 26:28.064
Do you know they bombed
The Grand Theatre, Plymouth?

26:28.099 --> 26:30.718
And much else of the city besides.

26:30.753 --> 26:33.103
I made my debut
at The Grand Theatre, Plymouth.

26:33.138 --> 26:35.098
They weren't to know.

26:35.133 --> 26:37.613
I shouldn't have come out this
autumn but I had no choice.

26:37.648 --> 26:40.378
He made me. Who?

26:40.413 --> 26:42.098
I should have rested.

26:42.133 --> 26:44.597
I had a friend that was
ordered to rest.

26:44.632 --> 26:47.061
He obeyed
and that was the end of him.

26:48.184 --> 26:49.503
He was ever so ill.

26:52.293 --> 26:54.498
Nearly became a Catholic.

26:54.533 --> 26:57.058
Right, now, would you like
a little rub-down?

26:59.213 --> 27:02.387
I'm not surprised
you're feeling dispirited.

27:04.783 --> 27:06.618
It's been ever such a hard time.

27:06.653 --> 27:10.783
No young men to play juveniles and
the trouble with Mr Davenport-Scott.

27:12.213 --> 27:14.113
What news of Mr Davenport-Scott?

27:16.003 --> 27:18.948
The police have opposed bail. What?

27:18.983 --> 27:24.473
Well, he'd had his second warning.
How then do we dispose our forces?

27:24.508 --> 27:27.900
Mr Thornton is standing by
to play Fool.

27:27.935 --> 27:31.258
And who as Oswald?
Mr Brown, I'm afraid.

27:31.293 --> 27:34.813
That leaves me a knight short for
"reason not the need".

27:34.848 --> 27:38.973
98 short, actually,
if you take the text as gospel.

27:39.008 --> 27:41.375
One more or less won't seem
too upsetting.

27:41.410 --> 27:43.708
Herr Hitler has made it
very difficult

27:43.743 --> 27:47.798
for Shakespearean companies.
It'll be a chapter in the book, Sir.

27:47.833 --> 27:51.853
I hate to mention it but we're going
to be short for the storm.

27:51.888 --> 27:53.983
We've no-one to operate
the wind machine,

27:54.018 --> 27:56.388
not if Mr Thornton is to play Fool.

27:56.423 --> 27:59.123
Mr Thornton was ever
so good on the wind machine.

27:59.158 --> 28:01.788
Madge knows the problem
but she's very unsympathetic.

28:01.823 --> 28:04.413
You tell Madge from me I must
have the storm at full strength.

28:04.448 --> 28:06.970
What about Oxenby?
Not the most amenable of gentlemen.

28:07.005 --> 28:09.493
Send him to me at the half.
I'll have a word with him.

28:09.528 --> 28:12.103
Better talk to Thornton, too.

28:12.138 --> 28:13.263
There you are, you see?

28:15.143 --> 28:16.798
That's more like it.

28:16.833 --> 28:20.503
You're where you belong,
doing what you know best,

28:20.538 --> 28:21.958
and you're yourself again.

28:21.993 --> 28:24.983
Right, well, you start
doing your make-up and I'll go

28:25.018 --> 28:27.383
and tell them to come and see you.

28:30.343 --> 28:33.064
I've cleaned the wig and beard.

28:33.099 --> 28:34.417
Shan't be a minute.

28:50.983 --> 28:54.191
Oh, no, Sir! Not Othello!

28:55.273 --> 28:58.833
The lines are fouled.
Up on your short, down on your long.

28:58.868 --> 29:00.258
Is there a dead for it?

29:00.293 --> 29:02.863
Instruct the puppeteer to
renew the strings.

29:02.898 --> 29:04.628
The stuffing is
escaping at the seams,

29:04.663 --> 29:07.823
straw from a scarecrow lies
scattered down, stage left.

29:07.858 --> 29:10.983
I would have given anything to see
the play tonight.

29:11.018 --> 29:15.983
There's you all blacked up
and Cordelia saying,

29:16.018 --> 29:18.383
"You beget me, bred me, loved me. "

29:21.543 --> 29:25.063
Well, the time has come,
if you don't mind my saying so,

29:25.098 --> 29:28.583
to stop waxing poetical
and to wax a bit more practical.

29:28.618 --> 29:31.097
KNOCKI NG
Who?

29:32.853 --> 29:33.945
Irene.

29:35.343 --> 29:37.550
I've come for the triple crown.
Enter.

29:41.913 --> 29:43.628
Good evening, Sir.

29:43.663 --> 29:46.127
All well? Yes, thank you, Sir.

29:46.162 --> 29:48.591
You've come for the triple crown.

29:50.103 --> 29:51.274
Yes, Sir.

29:52.863 --> 29:55.703
Polish it well. I like it gleaming.

29:55.738 --> 29:57.618
Yes, Sir.

29:57.653 --> 30:00.758
And return it to me
well before curtain up.

30:00.793 --> 30:03.863
I like to wear it by the quarter.
Yes, Sir.

30:03.898 --> 30:05.628
And when I have used it on stage,

30:05.663 --> 30:09.423
see that it is returned to my room
after the interval.

30:09.458 --> 30:11.015
She has done it before, Sir.

30:12.944 --> 30:14.150
I like to be certain.

30:17.453 --> 30:18.659
There it is, my child.

30:28.093 --> 30:29.993
Pretty young thing, aren't you?

30:32.093 --> 30:33.230
Thank you, Sir.

30:37.993 --> 30:40.712
Sir, it's time to age.

30:48.553 --> 30:51.433
They're all the same colour.
Which stick do I use?

30:51.468 --> 30:53.264
I can't see the colours.

31:01.433 --> 31:02.593
What now? How is he?

31:04.074 --> 31:06.698
He'll be all right
if he's left in peace.

31:06.733 --> 31:09.423
I want to see with my own eyes.
No, no, he is not to be disturbed.

31:09.458 --> 31:11.708
And what about the understudies?

31:11.743 --> 31:13.628
He knows all about it,
everything's in hand.

31:13.663 --> 31:16.263
You realise now there's going to be
an audience out there.

31:16.298 --> 31:18.863
It'd be a bit silly going through
all this if there wasn't.

31:18.898 --> 31:21.309
Will he be ready on time?
Will he be well enough? Yes.

31:24.623 --> 31:26.558
Madge, can I just, erm...?

31:26.593 --> 31:30.513
Who was that?
Just a minion minioning.

31:30.548 --> 31:34.433
Too many interruptions,
my concentration.

31:34.468 --> 31:37.428
Norman. Yes, Sir?

31:37.463 --> 31:39.513
How does the play begin?

31:39.548 --> 31:40.988
Which play, Sir?

31:41.023 --> 31:43.868
Tonight's, tonight's,
I cannot remember the first line.

31:43.903 --> 31:46.713
"Attend the lords of France
and Burgundy, Gloucester. "

31:46.748 --> 31:49.468
Yes, yes.

31:49.503 --> 31:51.443
What performance is this?

31:51.478 --> 31:53.348
Tonight will be your...

31:53.383 --> 31:57.029
227th performance of the part, Sir.

31:57.064 --> 32:00.143
227 Lears and I cannot remember
the first line.

32:00.178 --> 32:02.068
Haven't we forgotten
something else, Sir?

32:02.103 --> 32:05.027
If you don't mind my asking.
We have to sink our cheeks.

32:17.173 --> 32:19.598
I shall look like this in my coffin.

32:19.633 --> 32:22.534
And a broad straight line
of number 20 down the nose.

32:23.703 --> 32:25.193
'Give you strength, you say. '

32:27.824 --> 32:29.388
'Surgical spirit. '

32:29.423 --> 32:31.372
'I know how to stick on a beard.

32:31.407 --> 32:33.321
'I've been a depicter for 50 years. '

32:36.593 --> 32:38.743
'I shall need a rest after
the storm scenes. '

32:38.778 --> 32:41.109
'There's no need to tell me.
I know. '

32:44.944 --> 32:48.584
'And shall we take extra care with
the wig join tonight?'

32:52.383 --> 32:54.374
'I shall give them
a good one tonight. '

32:55.783 --> 32:57.428
Norman! Yes, Sir?

32:57.463 --> 33:00.814
What's the first line again? All this
clitter-clatter-chitter-chatter...

33:00.849 --> 33:03.238
"Attend the lords of France
and Burgundy, Gloucester. "

33:03.273 --> 33:05.873
You've put it out of my mind.
Keep silent when I'm dressing.

33:05.908 --> 33:07.428
I have work to do,
hard bloody labour.

33:07.463 --> 33:10.463
Sir, Sir. I cannot remember
the first line. 100,000 performances

33:10.498 --> 33:12.148
and I have to ask you
for the first line.

33:12.183 --> 33:14.503
Yes, I'll take you through it.
Take me through it?

33:14.538 --> 33:16.945
Nobody takes you through it,
you're put through it,

33:16.980 --> 33:19.353
night after night after night.
I haven't the strength.

33:19.388 --> 33:20.909
And you're a fine one.

33:20.944 --> 33:25.478
I must say, you of all people,

33:25.513 --> 33:29.118
you disappoint me,
if you don't mind my saying so.

33:29.153 --> 33:32.223
You, who always say that self-pity
is the most unattractive

33:32.258 --> 33:33.238
quality on stage or off.

33:33.273 --> 33:35.793
Who have you been working for
all these years?

33:35.828 --> 33:37.508
The Ministry of Information?

33:37.543 --> 33:40.148
Struggle and survival, you say,
that's all that matters.

33:40.183 --> 33:44.040
The whole world's struggling for
bloody survival, so why can't you?

33:47.513 --> 33:50.183
My dear Norman, I seem to have
upset you. I'm sorry.

33:50.218 --> 33:53.200
I understand.
We cannot always be strong.

33:53.235 --> 33:56.549
There is danger in
covering the cracks.

33:56.584 --> 33:59.863
Never mind about
covering the cracks,

33:59.898 --> 34:01.638
what about covering the wig join?

34:01.673 --> 34:05.154
KNOCKING
Half an hour, please, Sir. Already?

34:07.103 --> 34:09.598
You were in late this evening, Sir.

34:09.632 --> 34:11.233
She hasn't returned with
the triple crown.

34:11.268 --> 34:14.152
I like it on my head by now.

34:14.188 --> 34:15.478
Look! What?

34:15.513 --> 34:18.068
My hands, they're shaking.

34:18.103 --> 34:20.039
Well, they'll be very
effective in the part.

34:20.074 --> 34:24.833
Don't forget to make them up.
I can't stop them. You do it.

34:24.869 --> 34:27.498
Oh, oh, look here.

34:27.533 --> 34:29.433
Look here, it must be infectious.

34:37.632 --> 34:40.463
I can face the division
of my kingdom.

34:40.498 --> 34:41.757
I can cope with Fool.

34:41.793 --> 34:45.261
I can bear the reduction
of my retinue.

34:45.295 --> 34:48.730
I can stomach the curses
I have to utter.

34:49.753 --> 34:52.108
I can even face being
whipped by the storm.

34:53.313 --> 34:55.110
But I dread the final entrance.

34:56.433 --> 34:59.793
To carry my Cordelia...

34:59.828 --> 35:02.444
dead, dead.

35:03.793 --> 35:08.810
To cry like the wind,
howl, howl, howl.

35:10.233 --> 35:12.315
To lay her gently on the ground,
to die.

35:17.543 --> 35:19.079
Have I the strength?

35:20.743 --> 35:22.995
If you haven't the strength,
no-one has.

35:24.473 --> 35:26.521
You're a good friend, Norman.

35:29.084 --> 35:30.799
Thank you, Sir.

35:30.834 --> 35:34.903
You shall be rewarded.
Pardon me while I get my violin.

35:34.938 --> 35:37.076
Do not mock me. I may not have long.

35:39.033 --> 35:41.673
My father used to say that.
He lived till he was 93.

35:41.708 --> 35:43.959
He may still be alive,
for all I know.

35:49.523 --> 35:52.078
Bonzo, how do you feel?

35:52.113 --> 35:53.708
A little more myself, Pussy.

35:53.743 --> 35:58.476
You see? Once he's assumed
the disguise, he's a different man.

36:00.753 --> 36:03.404
"Egad, Madam,
thou hast a porcupine wit. "

36:06.553 --> 36:08.673
And are you sure you're
able to go on?

36:08.708 --> 36:11.551
On and on and on.

36:14.343 --> 36:16.653
Pussy, I thought
it was the black one tonight.

36:16.688 --> 36:19.460
My dear.
Did I wake in the night, Pussy?

36:19.495 --> 36:22.233
Did I thank you
for watching over me?

36:22.268 --> 36:24.780
Was there talk of violence?

36:24.815 --> 36:26.799
No, Bonzo, you dreamt it.

36:26.834 --> 36:28.783
I still have the feeling.

36:35.883 --> 36:39.163
Would you like me to fetch the
cloak and tie it on as usual?

36:39.198 --> 36:41.029
Yes, as usual.

36:41.064 --> 36:43.333
Oh, erm, Mr Thornton and Mr Oxenby

36:43.368 --> 36:45.568
are waiting outside to see you.

36:45.603 --> 36:47.348
Would you like me
to ask them to come in?

36:47.383 --> 36:49.058
I don't want to see Oxenby.
He frightens me.

36:49.093 --> 36:52.183
Mind you, he was the best
lago I've ever had or seen

36:52.218 --> 36:55.273
and I include that 4'6"
ponce Sir Arthur Palgrove.

36:55.308 --> 36:57.415
That's more like the Sir
we know and love.

36:57.450 --> 36:59.488
He went on playing Hamlet
till he was 68.

36:59.523 --> 37:02.228
There were more lines on his face
than steps to the gallery.

37:02.263 --> 37:06.313
I saw his Lear. I was pleasantly
disappointed. Sir Arthur Palgrove.

37:06.348 --> 37:07.919
Who advises His Majesty,
answer me that?

37:07.954 --> 37:10.613
You're a miracle-worker, Norman.
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

37:10.648 --> 37:12.243
(Here's a piece of chocolate
for you.)

37:12.278 --> 37:14.278
(Oh, thank you, Your Ladyship.)

37:14.313 --> 37:17.799
It'll be all hands to the pump
tonight, Norman.

37:17.834 --> 37:21.053
A small part of the service,
Your Ladyship. Thank you.

37:25.803 --> 37:28.351
Don't suppose I didn't see that
because I did.

37:30.513 --> 37:35.023
There are more children in this
beloved land of ours scavenging

37:35.058 --> 37:36.628
the larders for something sweet,

37:36.663 --> 37:38.488
if only they came to me
I could tell them of

37:38.523 --> 37:42.993
the one person in England who has an
inexhaustible supply of chocolate.

37:43.028 --> 37:46.753
Because it is I who have to carry
her dead as my Cordelia.

37:46.788 --> 37:49.603
It is I who have to lift her
up in my arms.

37:49.638 --> 37:51.998
Thank Christ, I thought,
for rationing

37:52.033 --> 37:55.033
but, no, she would find sugar
in a sand dune.

37:55.068 --> 37:56.768
Shall I show the actors in, Sir?

37:56.803 --> 38:00.318
What? No, I don't want...
Sir, you have to see the actors.

38:02.113 --> 38:05.002
Ah, Mr Thorton. Mr Thornton
to see you, Sir.

38:07.834 --> 38:10.669
SIR GARGLES

38:10.704 --> 38:12.808
Geoffrey, does the costume fit?

38:15.403 --> 38:17.799
Mr Davenport-Scott was
such a tall man.

38:17.834 --> 38:20.712
Mr Davenport-Scott was a worm.
You look, er...

38:25.443 --> 38:27.243
Do you know the lines? Yes.

38:27.278 --> 38:29.008
Don't keep me waiting for them.

38:29.043 --> 38:31.523
Oh, no.
Pace, pace, pace, pace, pace, pace.

38:31.558 --> 38:33.929
Yes. And keep out of my focus. Yes.

38:33.964 --> 38:36.399
The boom lights placed
in the downstage wings

38:36.434 --> 38:38.834
are for me and me only.
Yes, old man, I know.

38:38.869 --> 38:41.483
You must find what light you can.
Right.

38:41.518 --> 38:44.888
Let me hear you sing. What?

38:44.923 --> 38:47.403
"For he that has the little
tiny wit. Heigh-ho... "

38:48.844 --> 38:51.598
WHIMPERING: He... he...

38:51.633 --> 38:54.363
# He that has the little
tiny wit... #

38:55.743 --> 38:57.208
HE WHIMPERS

38:57.243 --> 39:00.578
# He that has and a little tiny wit

39:00.613 --> 39:04.478
# With a heigh-ho,
the wind and the rain

39:04.513 --> 39:08.208
# Must make content with
fortunes fit

39:08.243 --> 39:11.904
# For the rain it raineth
every day. #

39:13.373 --> 39:17.208
All right, speak it, don't sing it.

39:17.243 --> 39:19.909
And in the storm scene, if you
are going to put your arms around

39:19.944 --> 39:25.173
my legs, as Mr Davenport-Scott did,
then around my calves, not my thighs.

39:25.208 --> 39:27.305
He almost ruptured me twice.

39:27.340 --> 39:29.368
I'd rather I didn't, old man.

39:29.403 --> 39:31.663
Feel it, my boy, feel it,
it is the only way.

39:31.698 --> 39:33.779
Whatever takes you. Right.

39:33.814 --> 39:36.934
But do not let it take you too much.
Remain within the bounds.

39:36.969 --> 39:41.093
And, at all costs, remain still
when I speak. Of course.

39:41.128 --> 39:42.684
Serve the playwright...

39:42.719 --> 39:44.241
and keep your teeth in.

39:45.333 --> 39:47.548
It's only when I'm nervous.

39:47.583 --> 39:49.468
You will be nervous, I guarantee it.

39:49.503 --> 39:52.573
There will be no extra
payment for this performance.

39:52.608 --> 39:56.020
I believe your contract is
play as cast. Yes.

39:57.543 --> 40:00.865
Good fortune attend your endeavours.
Thank you, Sir.

40:03.533 --> 40:05.538
(God bless, Geoffrey.)

40:05.573 --> 40:08.019
(I'd rather face
the Nazi hordes any day.)

40:12.203 --> 40:14.893
I hope Mr Churchill has better
men in the cabinet.

40:14.928 --> 40:17.468
Mr Oxenby is waiting, Sir. Oxenby?

40:17.503 --> 40:20.173
What... what...? I don't know.
What does Oxenby want?

40:20.208 --> 40:21.218
It's not what he wants,

40:21.253 --> 40:23.793
it's what we want - someone to
operate the wind machine.

40:23.828 --> 40:25.814
I don't want to see Oxenby,
I can't bear the man,

40:25.849 --> 40:27.938
it's stifling in here.

40:27.973 --> 40:29.952
We'll have no storm without him.

40:32.333 --> 40:33.698
Mr Oxenby to see you, Sir.

40:36.533 --> 40:38.779
You wanted to see me?

40:38.814 --> 40:42.528
I... I don't know, erm, why?
Er, Norman?

40:42.563 --> 40:45.339
Sir was wondering
if he could ask of you a favour.

40:47.053 --> 40:48.259
He can ask.

40:50.143 --> 40:53.648
You've not been with us very long

40:53.683 --> 40:56.193
but I'm sure you've seen
enough to know that we're not

40:56.228 --> 41:01.143
so much a company as one great
big happy family.

41:01.178 --> 41:02.738
And...

41:02.773 --> 41:04.764
we all muck in as required.

41:09.483 --> 41:10.998
As I'm sure you've heard,

41:11.033 --> 41:14.893
Mr Davenport-Scott will not be
rejoining the company.

41:14.928 --> 41:16.728
Yes, I've heard.

41:16.763 --> 41:19.043
You share a dressing-room
with one or two of them,

41:19.078 --> 41:20.809
you hear nothing else.

41:20.844 --> 41:23.938
It upsets the pansy fraternity

41:23.973 --> 41:26.157
when one of their number is caught.

41:29.303 --> 41:31.708
Because Mr Thornton is having
to play Fool,

41:31.743 --> 41:36.103
and because our two elderly knights
are setting the hovel behind

41:36.138 --> 41:37.568
the cloth during the storm scene,

41:37.603 --> 41:39.901
we've no-one to operate
the wind machine.

41:44.463 --> 41:47.478
We'd ask Mr Brown
but he's really rather too fragile.

41:52.003 --> 41:54.858
We were wondering
if you'd turn the handle.

41:56.773 --> 41:58.104
In short, no.

42:00.383 --> 42:01.714
Anything else?

42:05.873 --> 42:07.602
Has he read my play yet?

42:11.023 --> 42:13.844
Perhaps the Russians have had
a setback on the Eastern Front.

42:13.879 --> 42:16.478
Bolshevism will be
the ruin of the theatre.

42:16.513 --> 42:20.543
What are we going to do?
Fancy not wanting to muck in.

42:20.578 --> 42:22.563
He hates me. I can feel his hatred.

42:22.598 --> 42:24.919
All I stand for he despises.

42:24.954 --> 42:28.423
I wouldn't read his play, even if
he were Commissar of Culture.

42:28.458 --> 42:30.903
I've read it.
Is there a part for me? Yes.

42:30.938 --> 42:32.558
I know what Oxenby's up to.

42:32.593 --> 42:34.448
He's writing plays for critics,
not people.

42:34.483 --> 42:36.373
Oughtn't we to be quiet
for a bit, Sir?

42:36.408 --> 42:38.263
Where's the girl with
the triple crown?

42:38.298 --> 42:40.390
Don't fuss. I'll go and find her.

42:59.523 --> 43:01.328
Oh, my dear.

43:01.363 --> 43:04.143
Norman's just gone to find you.

43:04.178 --> 43:06.790
Has he? I must have missed him.

43:06.825 --> 43:09.403
Remind me of your name, child.

43:09.438 --> 43:11.147
It's Irene, Sir.

43:11.182 --> 43:12.857
Irene. Charming.

43:15.163 --> 43:16.888
Were you at the Rada?

43:16.923 --> 43:19.423
No, sir. I went straight into Rep.

43:19.458 --> 43:21.923
Of course. I remember. Which Rep?

43:21.958 --> 43:26.132
Maidenhead. Maidenhead, yes.

43:27.714 --> 43:30.523
Next week in Eastbourne.

43:30.558 --> 43:33.298
KNOCKING
I can't find her.

43:33.333 --> 43:38.563
Just admiring her bone structure.
Run along, Irene. Run along.

43:38.598 --> 43:40.608
BELL RINGS

43:40.643 --> 43:43.563
A born actress.
Can tell by the cheek bones.

43:43.598 --> 43:46.448
Put the crown on.
It's almost the quarter.

43:46.483 --> 43:49.443
Shall I fetch her ladyship
and ask her to tie on the cloak?

43:49.478 --> 43:51.873
How does the play begin?
God help me, that child has

43:51.908 --> 43:54.458
driven it from my mind.
KNOCKING

43:54.493 --> 43:56.923
Quarter of an hour, please,
a few minutes late, I'm sorry,

43:56.958 --> 43:58.939
that girl Irene is going to be
the death of me.

43:58.974 --> 44:01.929
The quarter, I can't, I'm not ready,
tell them to go home,

44:01.964 --> 44:06.133
give them their money back.
I hate the swines, I can't, I can't.

44:06.168 --> 44:08.643
What are you saying? Do you want
the performance cancelled?

44:08.678 --> 44:10.821
No, he doesn't. How does it begin?

44:10.856 --> 44:12.929
For your own good.
How does it begin?

44:12.964 --> 44:16.123
You'll never get through it.
He will. How does it begin?!

44:16.158 --> 44:19.283
Get out, he'll be good and ready
when the curtain goes up.

44:19.318 --> 44:20.932
We've run out of time.

44:22.163 --> 44:25.964
There's 20 minutes yet.
We'll go up late, if necessary.

44:25.999 --> 44:31.043
Leave me in peace!
I cannot remember the lines.

44:31.078 --> 44:33.559
Norman, Norman, how does it begin?

44:33.594 --> 44:37.283
"He hath been out nine years
and away he shall again. "

44:37.318 --> 44:39.501
HE MIMICS A TRUMPET
"The King is coming. "

44:41.363 --> 44:44.014
"Attend the lords of France
and Burgundy, Gloucester. "

44:45.573 --> 44:48.453
"Attend the lords of France
and Burgundy, Gloucester. "

44:48.488 --> 44:49.681
"I shall, my liege. "

44:52.223 --> 44:55.527
Yes? "Meantime we shall
express our darker... "

44:55.562 --> 44:58.832
"Meantime we shall
express our darker purpose. "

45:02.574 --> 45:03.669
"Give me the map. "

45:03.704 --> 45:07.143
Don't tell me, don't tell me,
I know it!

45:07.178 --> 45:09.828
I'll ask for it if I need it.

45:09.863 --> 45:11.763
I have played this
part before, you know.

45:14.393 --> 45:15.828
"What do I fear?"

45:15.863 --> 45:18.834
Wrong.
"Know we have divided in three. "

45:18.869 --> 45:20.898
"Myself? There's none else by.

45:20.933 --> 45:25.783
"True, I talk of dreams, which are
the children of a troubled brain. "

45:25.818 --> 45:27.468
Wrong play, wrong play.

45:27.503 --> 45:29.714
"Can this cockpit hold the vasty
fields of France?"

45:29.749 --> 45:31.748
No, that's another wrong play.

45:31.783 --> 45:35.423
"Men should be what they seem.
Macbeth shall sleep no more!

45:35.458 --> 45:37.913
Now look what you've gone and done.
What?

45:37.948 --> 45:39.828
Go out, go out.

45:39.863 --> 45:41.933
You've quoted the Scottish play.

45:41.968 --> 45:44.584
Did I? Macb...? Did I?

45:44.619 --> 45:46.267
Oh, Christ. Out!

45:49.143 --> 45:52.423
Turn round three times.

45:52.458 --> 45:53.721
Two, three...

45:53.756 --> 45:54.984
Right, knock.

45:58.313 --> 46:00.358
Swear.

46:00.393 --> 46:01.929
Pisspots.
KNOCKING

46:05.193 --> 46:06.512
BELL RINGS

46:10.273 --> 46:13.629
"And my poor fool is hang'd. "

46:18.463 --> 46:19.839
You'll be all right.

46:25.313 --> 46:27.497
FROM ANOTHER ROOM: Do we have
a full house?

46:34.704 --> 46:36.114
Struggle, Bonzo.

46:37.183 --> 46:39.518
Survival, Pussy.

46:39.553 --> 46:41.393
FROM OUTSIDE: Beginners, please,
Act I.

46:41.428 --> 46:43.509
Beginners, please, Sir. Thank you.

46:45.724 --> 46:49.623
Let us descend
and survey the scene of battle.

46:49.658 --> 46:51.705
AIR-RAID SIREN

46:55.983 --> 46:59.123
The night I played my first
Lear there was a thunderstorm.

46:59.158 --> 47:01.623
A real thunderstorm.
But now they send bombs.

47:01.658 --> 47:03.600
How much more have I to endure?

47:03.635 --> 47:05.508
We are to speak Shakespeare tonight

47:05.543 --> 47:08.633
and they will go to any
lengths to prevent me.

47:08.668 --> 47:11.223
I shouldn't take it
too personally, Sir.

47:11.258 --> 47:13.108
LAUGHTER

47:13.143 --> 47:16.438
Bomb, bomb, bomb us
into submission if you dare!

47:16.473 --> 47:20.043
But each word I speak will be
a shield against your savagery,

47:20.078 --> 47:23.714
each line I utter
a protection against your terror.

47:23.749 --> 47:25.663
I don't think they can
hear you, Sir.

47:25.698 --> 47:27.766
Swines! Barbarians!

47:27.801 --> 47:29.834
BOMB HITS CLOSE BY

47:29.869 --> 47:32.598
HE GROANS

47:32.633 --> 47:34.715
Oh, no. Oh, Sir.

47:36.273 --> 47:38.008
Just as we were winning.

47:38.043 --> 47:42.663
Perhaps it's timely. He can't go on.
Look at him. Fetch Madge.

47:42.698 --> 47:44.258
Norman! Sir.

47:44.293 --> 47:46.549
Get me down to the stage. Yes.

47:46.584 --> 47:51.396
By Christ, no squadron of
Fascist Bolsheviks will stop me now.

47:53.834 --> 47:55.438
Do as I say!

48:05.663 --> 48:08.029
BOMBS DROP IN THE DISTANCE

48:11.714 --> 48:14.263
How is he?
Who'll make the announcement?

48:14.298 --> 48:16.470
Mr Davenport-Scott, of course.

48:16.505 --> 48:18.608
No! Oh, dear! You, then, Norman.

48:18.643 --> 48:21.193
Me, Sir? Do not argue,
I've given my orders,

48:21.228 --> 48:22.765
I have enough to contend with.

48:22.800 --> 48:24.303
Sir, I'm not equipped. Do it!

48:25.594 --> 48:26.765
Come on.

48:28.913 --> 48:31.518
Take the apron off,
for goodness' sake.

48:32.714 --> 48:35.922
PLANE FLIES OVERHEAD
BOMB CRASHES

48:48.193 --> 48:50.728
Ladies and gentlemen...

48:50.763 --> 48:55.193
Ladies and gentlemen,
the warning has just gone.

48:55.228 --> 48:58.318
An air-raid is in progress.

48:58.353 --> 49:00.873
We shall proceed
with the performance.

49:00.908 --> 49:02.773
MUTTERING

49:04.273 --> 49:06.834
Will those...
Will those who wish to live...

49:06.869 --> 49:08.916
CHUCKLES

49:10.273 --> 49:14.143
Will anyone who wishes to leave
do so as quietly as possible?

49:14.178 --> 49:15.963
Thank you.

49:17.844 --> 49:20.074
APPLAUSE

49:21.563 --> 49:22.746
Stand by.

49:26.793 --> 49:28.567
Stand by on tabs.

49:31.813 --> 49:33.778
(Stand by on stage.)

49:33.813 --> 49:36.509
Go LX. Go flies.
Curtain going up.

49:39.303 --> 49:42.763
I thought the King had more affected
the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.

49:42.798 --> 49:44.905
It did always seem so to us.

49:44.940 --> 49:46.761
Geoffrey, was I all right?

49:46.796 --> 49:48.583
Yes, yes, old man, damn good.

49:51.823 --> 49:53.518
Your Ladyship, was I all right?

49:53.553 --> 49:55.213
Better than Mr Davenport-Scott.

49:55.248 --> 49:57.645
Really? Do you mean that?

49:57.680 --> 50:00.008
I was ever so nervous.

50:00.043 --> 50:02.693
Do you think anyone
noticed the slip?

50:02.728 --> 50:04.752
"Will those who wish to live... "

50:04.787 --> 50:06.776
Ooh, I could have kicked myself.

50:08.663 --> 50:10.676
I was really all right?
You were fine.

50:13.943 --> 50:15.422
Did he say anything? No.

50:16.803 --> 50:18.054
Cueing grams.

50:19.123 --> 50:20.818
My services to Your Lordship.

50:23.273 --> 50:25.553
Stand by, please.
All right, Sir.

50:25.588 --> 50:26.747
Cueing timpani, Sir.

50:31.233 --> 50:34.680
The King is coming.
APPLAUSE

50:51.313 --> 50:53.398
Sir? What?

50:53.433 --> 50:54.998
Her Ladyship's entered.

50:55.033 --> 50:57.883
Oh, quite a nice round,
so it's your turn now.

50:57.918 --> 50:59.828
You see? What did I say?

50:59.863 --> 51:02.206
Please, Sir, the entrance.
You're on.

51:03.443 --> 51:05.844
Please, Sir, it's your entrance.

51:05.879 --> 51:07.323
Me thought I saw him.

51:08.714 --> 51:11.433
His procession formed,

51:11.468 --> 51:14.118
100 knights his escort...

51:14.153 --> 51:16.598
Mr Oxenby's having to extemporize.

51:16.633 --> 51:19.248
"Attend the lords of
France and Burgundy".

51:19.283 --> 51:23.718
The King, my father, was,
me thought, behind me.

51:23.753 --> 51:28.153
From our camp we marched,
a goodly distance,

51:28.188 --> 51:30.888
I ahead, as is our custom.

51:30.923 --> 51:33.594
Sir, the natives are
getting restless.

51:33.629 --> 51:35.323
Sound the fanfare again.

51:36.353 --> 51:37.648
DISTANT EXPLOSION

51:37.683 --> 51:40.460
Ah! Methinks I see the King.

51:40.495 --> 51:43.237
IMPACT OVERHEAD
AUDIENCE GASPS

51:45.873 --> 51:47.852
No, I was mistook.

51:49.604 --> 51:54.643
My Lord, with thy consent,
I shall to his majestic side,

51:54.678 --> 51:57.874
there to discover
his royal progress.

51:59.923 --> 52:02.168
Is he coming or isn't he? Yes!

52:02.203 --> 52:04.285
I'm cueing the King's fanfare again.

52:05.803 --> 52:09.023
"Attend the lords of France
and Burgundy, Gloucester. "

52:09.058 --> 52:11.563
FANFARE
Cue the knights, cue the knights.

52:11.598 --> 52:13.689
Oh! Go on, go on.

52:13.724 --> 52:15.476
Enter, for God's sake.

52:23.563 --> 52:27.248
APPLAUSE

52:27.283 --> 52:29.653
Attend the lords of France
and Burgundy, Gloucester.

52:29.688 --> 52:30.968
I shall, my liege.

52:31.003 --> 52:34.553
Meantime we shall express our darker
purpose. Give me the map there.

52:34.588 --> 52:38.026
Know that we have divided in three
our kingdom, and 'tis our fast

52:38.061 --> 52:41.464
intent to shake all cares and
business from our age, conferring

52:41.499 --> 52:46.573
them on younger selves, while we,
unburdened

52:46.608 --> 52:48.211
crawl toward death.

52:50.033 --> 52:53.698
Thou art a lady,
if only to go warm were gorgeous.

52:53.733 --> 52:57.363
Why, nature needs not
what thou gorgeous wear'st,

52:57.398 --> 52:59.206
which scarcely keeps thee warm.

53:00.923 --> 53:03.768
But for true need,

53:03.803 --> 53:07.153
you heavens, give
me that patience,

53:07.188 --> 53:08.882
patience I need.

53:12.643 --> 53:16.108
You see me here, you gods,
a poor old man,

53:16.143 --> 53:19.574
as full of grief as age,
wretched in both.

53:20.953 --> 53:23.768
If it be you that stirs
these daughters' hearts

53:23.803 --> 53:29.313
against their father, fool me
not so much to bear it tamely.

53:30.313 --> 53:32.156
Touch me with noble anger.

53:34.163 --> 53:39.623
And let not women's weapons,
water-drops, stain my man's cheeks!

53:39.658 --> 53:45.083
No, you unnatural hags, I will have
such revenges on you both.

53:45.118 --> 53:48.569
That all the world shall -
I will do such things -

53:48.604 --> 53:54.056
what they are yet I know not but they
shall be the terrors of the earth.

53:58.543 --> 54:02.143
You think I'll weep.

54:02.178 --> 54:05.709
No, I'll not weep.

54:05.744 --> 54:09.504
I have full cause of weeping
but this heart shall

54:09.539 --> 54:15.010
break into 100,000 flaws
or ere I'll weep.

54:17.163 --> 54:20.113
O, fool! I shall go mad.

54:20.148 --> 54:21.439
THUNDER SHEET BOOMS

54:21.474 --> 54:23.373
Let us withdraw, 'twill be a storm.

54:23.408 --> 54:25.465
I know you. Where's the king?

54:25.500 --> 54:27.488
Stay out of my focus, Geoffrey.

54:27.523 --> 54:29.158
Contending with
the fretful elements.

54:29.193 --> 54:32.113
Bids the wind blow the earth into
the sea or swell the curled waters

54:32.148 --> 54:34.288
'bove the main,
That things might change or cease.

54:34.323 --> 54:37.843
Geoffrey, wait. Don't get in
the light. Don't hold up, no pauses.

54:37.878 --> 54:40.755
Just keep the pace going.
Pace, pace, pace, pace, pace.

54:42.003 --> 54:45.833
Sir, I do know you, open this purse,
and take what it contains.

54:45.868 --> 54:48.803
A fie on this storm! Stand by.

54:48.838 --> 54:50.699
I shall go seek the King.

54:50.734 --> 54:53.988
Stand by LX. Now!
THUNDER SHEET BOOMS

54:54.023 --> 54:57.208
Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks.

54:57.243 --> 55:00.758
Rage, blow, you cataracts
and hurricanoes, strike.

55:00.793 --> 55:04.273
Thou sulphurous
and thought executing fires...

55:04.308 --> 55:07.268
Louder! He wants it louder!

55:07.303 --> 55:11.323
Singe my white head
and thou, all shaking thunder,

55:11.358 --> 55:14.313
strike flat the thick
rotundity o' th' world.

55:14.348 --> 55:16.478
Crack nature's moulds, all germens...

55:16.513 --> 55:19.803
Come on, louder!
He wants it louder, come on!

55:19.838 --> 55:22.963
That's not loud enough, louder!

55:22.998 --> 55:23.978
Come on, come on!

55:24.013 --> 55:27.924
Nor rain, wind, thunder,
fire are my daughters.

55:27.959 --> 55:31.835
So old and white as this.
O, ho, 'tis foul!

55:33.273 --> 55:37.328
Where was the storm?
Where was the storm?

55:37.363 --> 55:40.393
I ask for cataracts and hurricanoes
and I am given

55:40.428 --> 55:42.238
nothing but trickles and whistles.

55:42.273 --> 55:45.595
I demand oak-cleaving thunderbolts
and you answer with farting flies.

55:48.883 --> 55:52.410
THUNDER SHEET BOOMS

55:55.553 --> 55:59.658
Norman, Norman, you have thwarted me.

55:59.693 --> 56:04.353
I was there, within sight,
I had only to be spurred upwards

56:04.388 --> 56:09.013
and the glory was mine for
the plucking and there was naught,

56:09.048 --> 56:11.645
zero, silence, a breeze,
oh, a breeze!

56:11.680 --> 56:14.208
A shower,
a collision of cotton-wool,

56:14.243 --> 56:19.203
a flapping of butterfly wings.
I want a tempest not a drizzle.

56:19.238 --> 56:21.238
Something will have to be done.

56:21.273 --> 56:24.128
I demand to know what happened
tonight to the storm!

56:27.453 --> 56:29.045
I'm pleased you're pleased.

56:30.393 --> 56:34.753
I've never known you not complain
when you've really been at it

56:34.788 --> 56:39.113
and, tonight, one could safely say,
without fear of contradiction,

56:39.148 --> 56:40.603
you were at it.

56:42.263 --> 56:43.571
Go on, rest now.

56:46.013 --> 56:49.604
You've the interval and all
of Gloucester's blinding before,

56:49.639 --> 56:51.845
"No, they cannot touch me
for coining. "

56:58.043 --> 56:59.928
Try to sleep.

56:59.963 --> 57:03.028
You've been through it.

57:03.063 --> 57:05.848
Or been put through it,

57:05.883 --> 57:08.598
whichever you prefer.

57:08.633 --> 57:13.400
And you need quiet, as the deaf-mute
said to the piano tuner.

57:18.604 --> 57:24.093
Mighty, Her Ladyship thought you
were tonight, she did,

57:24.128 --> 57:26.163
that was the word she used.

57:30.323 --> 57:31.483
"Mighty. "

57:37.273 --> 57:42.103
Of course, I cannot comment
on the storm scene but I did hear,

57:42.138 --> 57:44.563
"O Reason not the need".

57:44.598 --> 57:46.208
Tremble-making.

57:46.243 --> 57:49.993
Never seen you
so full of the real thing,

57:50.028 --> 57:53.193
if you don't mind my saying so, Sir.

57:53.228 --> 57:54.248
And here's a funny thing.

57:54.283 --> 57:57.354
In the storm scene, while we were
beating ourselves delirious

57:57.389 --> 57:59.843
and I was having to jump
between thunder sheet

57:59.878 --> 58:02.128
and timpani,

58:02.163 --> 58:06.633
like a juggler with
rubber balls and Indian clubs,

58:06.668 --> 58:10.115
Mr Oxenby came to our aid,
uninvited.

58:10.150 --> 58:13.563
Not a word said,
just gave assistance

58:13.598 --> 58:15.528
when assistance was needed.

58:15.563 --> 58:18.173
Afterwards, just before
the interval, I thanked him.

58:18.208 --> 58:21.368
"Get stuffed,"
he said, which wasn't nice.

58:21.403 --> 58:24.883
And then he added, scornfully,
"I don't know why I helped. "

58:24.918 --> 58:27.342
And I said, "Because we
are a band of brothers,

58:27.377 --> 58:29.767
"and you're one of us
in spite of yourself. "

58:31.923 --> 58:35.103
I did, that's what I said.

58:35.138 --> 58:37.710
He hobbled away, his head down

58:37.745 --> 58:40.283
and if he was given to muttering,

58:40.318 --> 58:42.173
he'd have muttered.

58:42.208 --> 58:44.498
Darkly.

58:44.533 --> 58:45.648
Are you asleep, Sir?

58:48.253 --> 58:50.408
To be driven thus.

58:50.443 --> 58:52.528
I hate the swines.

58:52.563 --> 58:56.333
Who? Who is it that you hate?

58:56.368 --> 58:57.608
The critics?

58:57.643 --> 58:59.938
The critics? Hate the critics?

58:59.973 --> 59:01.968
I have nothing
but compassion for them.

59:02.003 --> 59:05.833
How can one hate the crippled,
the mentally deficient and the dead?

59:05.868 --> 59:09.533
Bastards. Who then? Who then what?

59:09.568 --> 59:11.218
Who then is it that you hate?

59:11.253 --> 59:14.693
Let me rest, Norman, you must
stop questioning me, let me rest.

59:14.728 --> 59:18.003
But don't leave me till I'm asleep.
Don't leave me alone.

59:18.038 --> 59:21.723
I am a spent force.
My days are numbered.

59:40.523 --> 59:43.083
Is he asleep? I think so, yes.

59:43.118 --> 59:44.334
I'll sit with him.

59:45.843 --> 59:49.620
Well, don't wake him,
Your Ladyship. He's ever so tired.

59:56.604 --> 59:58.068
METAL CLANGS

59:58.103 --> 59:59.498
Is it my cue?

59:59.533 --> 01:00:01.046
No, it's still the interval.

01:00:03.053 --> 01:00:04.975
I have things to say.

01:00:05.923 --> 01:00:09.498
Norman tells me you thought
I was mighty tonight.

01:00:09.533 --> 01:00:12.463
I never said anything of the kind.
He makes these things up.

01:00:12.498 --> 01:00:14.459
What have you to say?

01:00:14.494 --> 01:00:15.973
What I always have to say.

01:00:16.008 --> 01:00:17.474
You know my answer.

01:00:20.793 --> 01:00:22.413
You've worked hard.

01:00:22.448 --> 01:00:24.260
You've saved.

01:00:24.295 --> 01:00:26.038
Enough's enough.

01:00:26.073 --> 01:00:28.614
Tonight, in your curtain speech,

01:00:28.649 --> 01:00:30.063
make the announcement.

01:00:30.098 --> 01:00:31.228
I can't.

01:00:31.263 --> 01:00:33.523
You won't. I have no choice.

01:00:33.558 --> 01:00:34.938
You'll die.

01:00:34.973 --> 01:00:36.983
Or end up a vegetable!

01:00:37.018 --> 01:00:38.958
Well, that's your affair.

01:00:38.993 --> 01:00:41.343
But you're not going to
drag me with you.

01:00:41.378 --> 01:00:43.658
I am helpless, Pussy.
I do what I'm told.

01:00:43.693 --> 01:00:46.923
I cower, I'm frightened
of being whipped, I am driven.

01:00:46.958 --> 01:00:48.898
Driven? No. Cruel? Yes,

01:00:48.933 --> 01:00:51.329
Obstinate? Yes. Ruthless? Yes.

01:00:51.364 --> 01:00:54.533
Don't! For an actor, you have
a woeful lack of insight.

01:00:54.568 --> 01:00:56.565
Use your great imagination,

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:58.586
use your inspired gifts,

01:00:58.621 --> 01:01:00.437
try to imagine what I feel,

01:01:00.472 --> 01:01:02.862
what I'm forced to go through.

01:01:02.897 --> 01:01:05.253
I do! But I need you beside me,

01:01:05.288 --> 01:01:06.818
familiar, real!

01:01:06.853 --> 01:01:09.843
I am beside you, darning tights.
Very familiar, quite real.

01:01:09.878 --> 01:01:12.858
All I ask, Bonzo, is that we stop.

01:01:12.893 --> 01:01:16.283
Now, tonight, the end of the week -
but no more.

01:01:16.318 --> 01:01:17.808
I can't take any more.

01:01:17.843 --> 01:01:19.808
It's not possible. It is possible.

01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:21.738
No. You deceive no-one but yourself.

01:01:21.773 --> 01:01:25.533
If that were true, why then am I here, with
bombs falling, risking life and limb? Why?

01:01:25.568 --> 01:01:28.584
Not by choice. I have a duty.
I have to keep the faith.

01:01:28.619 --> 01:01:30.053
Oh, balls!

01:01:30.088 --> 01:01:31.408
What?

01:01:31.443 --> 01:01:34.183
You do nothing
without self-interest.

01:01:34.218 --> 01:01:36.325
And you drag everyone with you.

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:38.398
Me - chained, not even by law.

01:01:38.433 --> 01:01:41.263
Oh, would marriage have made
that much difference to you?

01:01:41.298 --> 01:01:43.488
You misunderstand, deliberately.

01:01:43.523 --> 01:01:45.398
I should have made her
divorce me, yeah!

01:01:45.433 --> 01:01:48.323
You didn't get a divorce
because you wanted a knighthood.

01:01:48.358 --> 01:01:51.575
That's not true. True?
You know where your priorities lie.

01:01:51.610 --> 01:01:54.793
Whatever you do is to your advantage
and to no-one else's.

01:01:54.828 --> 01:01:56.738
Talk about being driven.

01:01:56.773 --> 01:02:00.213
You make yourself sound like
a disinterested stagehand.

01:02:00.248 --> 01:02:02.643
You do nothing without
self-interest.

01:02:02.678 --> 01:02:04.298
You. Self. Alone.

01:02:04.333 --> 01:02:07.983
Pussy, please, I'm sinking.
Do not push me further into the mud.

01:02:08.018 --> 01:02:10.589
Sir. Her Ladyship. Fantasies.

01:02:10.624 --> 01:02:13.484
For God's sake,
you're a third-rate actor-manager

01:02:13.519 --> 01:02:15.038
on a tatty tour of the provinces,

01:02:15.073 --> 01:02:17.633
not some Colossus
bestriding the narrow world.

01:02:17.668 --> 01:02:20.193
Sir, Her Ladyship(!)
Look at me - darning tights.

01:02:20.228 --> 01:02:21.768
Look at you.

01:02:21.803 --> 01:02:24.098
Lear's hovel is luxury
compared to this.

01:02:24.133 --> 01:02:26.833
I'm not well, I have half
of Lear's life ahead of me,

01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:28.567
I have to carry you in my arms,

01:02:28.602 --> 01:02:32.007
I have "Howl, howl, howl!"
yet to speak!

01:02:32.042 --> 01:02:35.773
"Sir", "Her Ladyship" -
We're a laughing-stock!

01:02:35.774 --> 01:02:36.859
You'd never get a knighthood

01:02:36.894 --> 01:02:39.249
because the King doesn't possess
a double-edged sword.

01:02:46.254 --> 01:02:50.692
Do you remember, years ago,
an actress, one of our Gonerils?

01:02:50.727 --> 01:02:55.131
She was a tall, dark, handsome girl
with a Grecian nose.

01:02:57.414 --> 01:02:58.899
Flora Bacon.

01:02:58.934 --> 01:03:00.822
Was it? Yes, perhaps it was.

01:03:02.134 --> 01:03:03.374
Flora.

01:03:05.774 --> 01:03:08.365
Do you remember the night
I was rather hard on Norman

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.939
because he'd got my tights inside out

01:03:09.974 --> 01:03:11.944
during the quick change
in The Wandering Jew?

01:03:11.979 --> 01:03:14.139
Or was it The Sign Of The Cross?

01:03:16.084 --> 01:03:17.381
Whichever.

01:03:18.304 --> 01:03:19.748
She turned on me.

01:03:21.094 --> 01:03:23.704
"He may be your servant," she said,
"but he is a human being. "

01:03:23.739 --> 01:03:25.969
Then, to Norman, she said,
"Why don't you leave him?

01:03:26.004 --> 01:03:29.864
"Why do you put up with it?" And Norman said,
"Don't fuss. He only gives as good as he gets.

01:03:29.899 --> 01:03:31.819
"He has to take it out
on someone," he said.

01:03:31.854 --> 01:03:34.505
And he was right. Because
Flora Bacon didn't understand.

01:03:36.214 --> 01:03:38.170
Slave driver she called me.

01:03:39.994 --> 01:03:42.059
Why ever did I employ her?

01:03:42.094 --> 01:03:45.666
Her mother was Lady Bacon.
She invested Â£200 in the company.

01:03:51.495 --> 01:03:55.375
I thought tonight I caught sight
of him, or saw myself as he sees me.

01:03:55.410 --> 01:03:57.514
Speaking, "Reason not the need. "

01:03:58.654 --> 01:04:01.179
"Go on, you bastard,"
I seemed to be saying or hearing.

01:04:01.214 --> 01:04:05.134
"Go on, you've more to give.
Don't hold back. More, more, more!"

01:04:05.169 --> 01:04:06.854
And I was watching Lear.

01:04:06.889 --> 01:04:08.489
Yes!

01:04:08.524 --> 01:04:10.788
Each word he spoke
was fresh invented.

01:04:11.934 --> 01:04:14.784
I had no knowledge of what came next,
what fate awaited him.

01:04:14.819 --> 01:04:17.776
The agony was in
the moment of acting created.

01:04:19.214 --> 01:04:20.875
Ha!

01:04:22.104 --> 01:04:23.935
And I saw an old man.

01:04:28.004 --> 01:04:30.290
And the old man...

01:04:31.784 --> 01:04:33.308
.. was me.

01:04:36.654 --> 01:04:38.349
Don't leave me.

01:04:40.004 --> 01:04:41.505
I'll rest easy if you stay.

01:04:43.505 --> 01:04:45.496
But don't ask of me the impossible.

01:04:48.748 --> 01:04:49.965
Otherwise...

01:04:55.758 --> 01:04:58.322
.. without you, in darkness,

01:04:58.357 --> 01:05:00.852
I will see a locked door,

01:05:00.887 --> 01:05:03.127
a sign, "Closed", in the window,

01:05:03.162 --> 01:05:04.788
"Closed - gone away".

01:05:08.527 --> 01:05:10.085
And a drawn blind.

01:05:11.777 --> 01:05:13.937
I'll stay till Norman returns.

01:05:13.972 --> 01:05:15.427
HE LAUGHS

01:05:16.567 --> 01:05:18.447
I meant longer.

01:05:18.482 --> 01:05:19.880
Please.

01:05:23.057 --> 01:05:24.887
Oh, please, Pussy.

01:05:24.922 --> 01:05:26.935
HE GASPS

01:05:28.287 --> 01:05:30.447
Reassure me.

01:05:30.482 --> 01:05:32.170
I'm sick.

01:05:32.205 --> 01:05:33.858
Sick.

01:05:35.077 --> 01:05:37.705
Yes, so am I.

01:05:39.337 --> 01:05:40.852
Sick.

01:05:40.887 --> 01:05:45.007
I'm sick of cold railway trains,

01:05:45.042 --> 01:05:47.064
cold waiting rooms,

01:05:47.099 --> 01:05:49.052
cold Sundays on Crewe,

01:05:49.087 --> 01:05:51.157
and eating cold food late at night.

01:05:52.337 --> 01:05:54.537
I'm sick of packing and unpacking

01:05:54.572 --> 01:05:56.082
and of darning tights.

01:05:56.117 --> 01:05:59.777
I'm sick of the smell of
rotting costumes and naphthalene.

01:05:59.812 --> 01:06:01.472
And most of all,

01:06:01.507 --> 01:06:04.757
I'm sick of reading week after week

01:06:04.792 --> 01:06:07.332
that I'm barely adequate, too old,

01:06:07.367 --> 01:06:09.872
the best of a bad supporting cast.

01:06:11.047 --> 01:06:14.551
Unequal to you,
unworthy of your gifts.

01:06:17.117 --> 01:06:19.665
And I'm sick of having to
put on a brave face.

01:06:30.787 --> 01:06:34.348
I should have left you in Baltimore
on the last American tour.

01:06:35.397 --> 01:06:37.957
I should have accepted
Mr Feldman's offer

01:06:37.992 --> 01:06:40.414
and taken the 20th Century west.

01:06:41.627 --> 01:06:44.677
Feldman thought
I wouldn't photograph well.

01:06:44.712 --> 01:06:46.362
Swine.

01:06:46.397 --> 01:06:47.822
I hate the cinema.

01:06:47.857 --> 01:06:49.495
I believe in living things.

01:06:50.717 --> 01:06:52.872
How quickly one's looks go.

01:06:52.907 --> 01:06:55.987
They haven't built a camera
large enough to record me.

01:06:56.022 --> 01:06:58.453
I wouldn't have minded
a modest success.

01:06:58.488 --> 01:07:01.572
Why they knighted that dwarf
Arthur Palgrove I shall never know.

01:07:01.607 --> 01:07:04.657
"Arise, Sir Arthur," said the King.
"But, Sir, I wasn't kneeling. "

01:07:04.692 --> 01:07:08.149
Not once in his whole career
did he put a toe outside London.

01:07:09.547 --> 01:07:11.052
I liked America.

01:07:11.087 --> 01:07:12.522
I hated the swines.

01:07:12.557 --> 01:07:14.957
KNOCK AT DOOR
'Act Two beginners, please!'

01:07:16.837 --> 01:07:19.382
I must rest now, Pussy.
I want peace.

01:07:19.417 --> 01:07:22.282
All you want is
to have your cake and to eat it.

01:07:22.317 --> 01:07:25.797
I've never seen any point in having
cake unless one is going to eat it.

01:07:25.832 --> 01:07:27.717
Ha-ha(!) Ha-ha ha-ha(!)

01:07:27.752 --> 01:07:29.032
Everything jolly?

01:07:29.067 --> 01:07:30.932
Don't you know what knocking is?

01:07:30.967 --> 01:07:33.378
Oh, please, Sir -
not in front of Her Ladyship.

01:07:33.413 --> 01:07:35.392
Well, I've been mingling.

01:07:35.427 --> 01:07:37.672
You should hear
what they think out there -

01:07:37.707 --> 01:07:39.917
I have never known
an interval like it.

01:07:39.952 --> 01:07:42.122
Michelangelo, William Blake -

01:07:42.157 --> 01:07:44.707
God knows who else
you reminded them of.

01:07:44.742 --> 01:07:46.379
One poor boy...

01:07:47.577 --> 01:07:50.017
.. an airman, head bandaged,

01:07:50.052 --> 01:07:52.094
was weeping in the stalls bar,

01:07:52.129 --> 01:07:54.102
comforted by an older man -

01:07:54.137 --> 01:07:57.932
once blonde, now grey,
parchment skin and dainty hands -

01:07:57.967 --> 01:08:02.297
who went on saying, "There, there,
Evelyn, it's only a play. "

01:08:02.332 --> 01:08:04.417
Which didn't seem to me
any comfort at all

01:08:04.452 --> 01:08:06.252
because, if it hadn't been a play,

01:08:06.287 --> 01:08:08.460
then "There-there- Evelyn"
wouldn't be so upset.

01:08:10.508 --> 01:08:11.927
Michelangelo, did they?

01:08:11.962 --> 01:08:13.022
And Blake.

01:08:13.057 --> 01:08:14.577
I'm going to my room.

01:08:14.612 --> 01:08:15.932
Please stay.

01:08:15.967 --> 01:08:18.737
You must rest, Bonzo -
mustn't he Norman?

01:08:18.772 --> 01:08:20.096
Yes, he must.

01:08:20.131 --> 01:08:21.256
Pussy...

01:08:30.807 --> 01:08:32.902
Be gentle with Her Ladyship.

01:08:32.937 --> 01:08:35.368
I'm always gentle with Her Ladyship.

01:08:35.403 --> 01:08:36.618
Especially gentle.

01:08:37.737 --> 01:08:38.692
Why?

01:08:39.966 --> 01:08:41.184
Time of life.

01:08:42.727 --> 01:08:44.631
Ohh!

01:08:44.667 --> 01:08:47.742
You mean flushes
and dizzy spells?

01:08:47.777 --> 01:08:51.216
She's become very
preoccupied with herself.

01:08:51.252 --> 01:08:53.849
Sounds like a bad attack of change.

01:08:53.884 --> 01:08:56.447
Be gentle. I don't want her hurt.

01:08:56.482 --> 01:08:58.776
BELL RINGS

01:08:58.810 --> 01:09:01.071
Ai-ai!

01:09:04.447 --> 01:09:05.687
Sleep now.

01:09:07.687 --> 01:09:09.307
Is there anything else you want?

01:09:09.341 --> 01:09:10.862
Oblivion.

01:09:10.897 --> 01:09:12.937
That'll come sooner or later.

01:09:12.971 --> 01:09:14.017
And I hope later.

01:09:15.258 --> 01:09:17.343
I shall wake you in plenty of time

01:09:17.377 --> 01:09:20.426
so you can enter fantastically
dressed in wild flowers.

01:09:23.147 --> 01:09:25.229
Sleep tight,
don't let the bugs bite.

01:09:49.295 --> 01:09:50.886
Fetch Madge!

01:10:04.697 --> 01:10:06.699
KNOCK ON DOOR

01:10:12.027 --> 01:10:13.528
Yes?

01:10:14.587 --> 01:10:15.952
It's going well, I think.

01:10:17.177 --> 01:10:18.986
Except for your first entrance.

01:10:33.797 --> 01:10:35.014
Come here.

01:10:36.927 --> 01:10:38.371
Hold my hand.

01:10:40.127 --> 01:10:42.083
Please.

01:10:47.378 --> 01:10:49.262
It's like ice.

01:10:49.297 --> 01:10:51.112
Cold with fear.

01:10:51.147 --> 01:10:52.978
What are you frightened of?

01:10:54.587 --> 01:10:55.770
Of what is to come.

01:10:57.097 --> 01:10:59.137
You know who you're
talking to, do you?

01:10:59.172 --> 01:11:00.737
It's me, not someone to impress.

01:11:00.772 --> 01:11:02.862
I'm speaking from my heart.

01:11:02.897 --> 01:11:06.152
I have never before felt so lonely.

01:11:06.187 --> 01:11:08.826
Please, I have a show to run...
Listen to me.

01:11:10.407 --> 01:11:12.329
I am frightened of what is to come.

01:11:14.017 --> 01:11:17.927
And I meant it, because,
for the first time in my life,

01:11:17.962 --> 01:11:19.887
the future is hidden from me.

01:11:19.922 --> 01:11:21.612
I see no friends.

01:11:21.647 --> 01:11:23.649
I am not warmed by fellowship.

01:11:24.877 --> 01:11:26.823
I know only...

01:11:26.858 --> 01:11:28.769
awful solitude.

01:11:29.897 --> 01:11:32.072
An occupational hazard.

01:11:32.107 --> 01:11:34.678
You wanted to see me, about what?

01:11:35.697 --> 01:11:38.397
I look on you as my one true friend.

01:11:38.432 --> 01:11:41.097
I have to go back to the corner.

01:11:41.132 --> 01:11:42.416
Have you been happy?

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:46.264
Has it been worth it?

01:11:48.237 --> 01:11:49.989
No, I've not been happy.

01:11:52.777 --> 01:11:54.307
Yes, it's been worth it.

01:11:54.342 --> 01:11:55.899
Madge, dear...

01:11:58.518 --> 01:12:01.703
In my will, I've left you
all my press-cutting books.

01:12:03.527 --> 01:12:05.842
I don't want to hear what
you've left me in your will.

01:12:05.877 --> 01:12:09.699
Cuttings and notices that span
a lifetime, an entire career.

01:12:10.897 --> 01:12:12.926
I've kept them religiously.

01:12:12.961 --> 01:12:14.956
Good and bad notices alike.

01:12:16.697 --> 01:12:18.585
Not all that many bad.

01:12:21.457 --> 01:12:23.960
Talk of me sometimes.
Speak well of me.

01:12:26.027 --> 01:12:28.487
Actors live on only
in the memory of others.

01:12:28.522 --> 01:12:29.488
Speak well of me.

01:12:31.457 --> 01:12:33.186
This is a ridiculous conversation.

01:12:34.457 --> 01:12:36.582
You're in the middle
of a performance of Lear,

01:12:36.617 --> 01:12:38.992
playing rather less mechanically
than you have of late,

01:12:39.027 --> 01:12:41.977
and you talk as if you're organising
your own memorial service.

01:12:42.012 --> 01:12:44.957
The most wonderful thing in life
is to be remembered.

01:12:46.587 --> 01:12:47.667
Speak well of me.

01:12:49.258 --> 01:12:50.862
You'll be believed.

01:12:50.897 --> 01:12:52.467
You'll be remembered.

01:12:52.502 --> 01:12:54.502
Madge, dear...

01:12:54.537 --> 01:12:56.539
I have something for you.

01:12:57.977 --> 01:12:59.786
I want you to have this ring.

01:13:00.977 --> 01:13:04.595
If possessions can be dear,
this ring is the dearest thing I own.

01:13:06.787 --> 01:13:09.022
Edmund Kean wore this ring

01:13:09.057 --> 01:13:15.027
in a play whose title is an apt
inscription for what I feel -

01:13:15.062 --> 01:13:18.457
A New Way To Pay Old Debts.

01:13:18.492 --> 01:13:21.113
When you talk of it,

01:13:21.148 --> 01:13:23.537
say Edmund Kean and I wore it.

01:13:25.747 --> 01:13:29.388
I once had it in mind
to give it to you...

01:13:29.423 --> 01:13:30.867
years ago.

01:13:32.777 --> 01:13:35.302
But you were younger then,

01:13:35.337 --> 01:13:37.544
and I thought
you would misunderstand.

01:13:39.907 --> 01:13:41.147
Yes.

01:13:43.667 --> 01:13:46.761
A ring from a man to a woman
is easily misunderstood.

01:13:49.107 --> 01:13:52.617
I know I'm thought insensitive,

01:13:52.652 --> 01:13:54.382
but I'm not blind.

01:13:54.417 --> 01:13:56.072
No. I've always known you were aware

01:13:56.107 --> 01:13:57.950
of what the spinster
in the corner felt.

01:14:00.627 --> 01:14:02.827
You were right not to give me
the ring years ago.

01:14:02.862 --> 01:14:04.226
I lived in hope then.

01:14:06.877 --> 01:14:10.017
At least I've seen you every day,
made myself useful to you.

01:14:15.477 --> 01:14:17.160
I settled for what I could get.

01:14:20.667 --> 01:14:22.658
You are the only one
who truly loves me.

01:14:44.317 --> 01:14:46.012
Beginners for act two.

01:14:56.317 --> 01:14:58.387
KNOCK AT DOOR
Who?

01:14:59.557 --> 01:15:03.937
Irene. I'm returning
the triple crown, Sir.

01:15:03.972 --> 01:15:05.213
Come.

01:15:05.248 --> 01:15:08.331
BELL RINGS

01:15:12.437 --> 01:15:14.337
Put it down.

01:15:28.927 --> 01:15:33.287
Sir, will it disturb you
if I say something?

01:15:33.322 --> 01:15:35.255
Depends what it is.

01:15:36.727 --> 01:15:39.262
I just wanted to thank you.

01:15:39.297 --> 01:15:42.292
For what?
The performance this evening.

01:15:42.327 --> 01:15:45.592
It's not over yet. I felt honoured
to be on the stage.

01:15:45.627 --> 01:15:48.858
Open that drawer, you will find
a photograph of me.

01:16:14.047 --> 01:16:16.049
I love coming into this room.

01:16:17.527 --> 01:16:19.017
I can feel the power.

01:16:19.052 --> 01:16:20.735
And the mystery.

01:16:22.128 --> 01:16:25.097
In days gone by,
this would have been a place

01:16:25.132 --> 01:16:27.087
where the High Priests robed.

01:16:27.122 --> 01:16:28.531
A kindred spirit.

01:16:30.897 --> 01:16:32.626
Lock the door.

01:16:52.017 --> 01:16:53.314
Come nearer.

01:16:54.382 --> 01:16:56.077
It's Irene.

01:16:57.874 --> 01:16:59.273
Irene.

01:17:05.164 --> 01:17:07.134
You want to act?

01:17:07.169 --> 01:17:09.070
Yes. Passionately?

01:17:09.105 --> 01:17:11.834
Yes.
With every fibre of your being?

01:17:11.869 --> 01:17:13.200
Yes.

01:17:13.235 --> 01:17:15.034
To the exclusion of all else?

01:17:15.069 --> 01:17:16.869
Yes.

01:17:16.904 --> 01:17:22.804
You must be prepared to sacrifice
what most people call...

01:17:22.839 --> 01:17:24.881
Life.

01:17:24.916 --> 01:17:26.889
I am.

01:17:26.924 --> 01:17:29.768
Your birth sign? Scorpio.

01:17:33.554 --> 01:17:34.989
Good.

01:17:35.024 --> 01:17:40.031
Ambition, secretiveness, loyalty,
capable of great jealously.

01:17:42.554 --> 01:17:44.909
Essential qualities in the theatre.

01:17:46.414 --> 01:17:47.858
Have you good legs?

01:17:51.604 --> 01:17:53.014
Come closer.

01:17:58.574 --> 01:18:00.110
Let me see.

01:18:05.594 --> 01:18:06.879
Higher.

01:18:10.054 --> 01:18:15.675
TOO good. All the best actresses
have legs like tree trunks.

01:18:23.674 --> 01:18:26.199
There's not much of you, is there?

01:18:27.274 --> 01:18:29.276
Such small bones.

01:18:34.794 --> 01:18:36.921
Are you getting enough to eat?

01:18:39.764 --> 01:18:42.374
SHE GASPS

01:18:42.409 --> 01:18:45.021
So young...

01:18:45.056 --> 01:18:47.599
So young...

01:18:47.634 --> 01:18:49.090
HE GROWLS, SHE SCREAMS

01:18:50.404 --> 01:18:52.634
That's more like it!

01:18:55.164 --> 01:18:58.804
Too late, too late.

01:19:01.985 --> 01:19:06.684
Well, now, my dainty duck,
my dearie-o. Let go of me!

01:19:06.719 --> 01:19:09.701
What was all that about?
He seems better.

01:19:09.736 --> 01:19:12.649
Better than what or whom,
as the case may be?

01:19:12.684 --> 01:19:15.814
I didn't think he'd get through
the performance tonight.

01:19:15.849 --> 01:19:17.929
He's NOT through it yet.
I'm waiting.

01:19:17.964 --> 01:19:20.954
For what? A graphic description
of events. Out with it,

01:19:20.989 --> 01:19:22.684
or I shall slap your face - hard.

01:19:22.719 --> 01:19:24.441
I thought we were friends!

01:19:24.476 --> 01:19:26.164
I thought we were too.

01:19:26.199 --> 01:19:27.165
Irene...

01:19:28.964 --> 01:19:31.679
I shall long remember welcoming
you into the company,

01:19:31.714 --> 01:19:34.334
in the prop room of
the Palace Theatre, Newark-on-Trent.

01:19:34.369 --> 01:19:36.954
You were locked in the arms
of the Prince of Morocco,

01:19:36.989 --> 01:19:39.699
a married man,
and ever such a comic sight

01:19:39.734 --> 01:19:42.444
with his tights round his ankles
and you smeared black.

01:19:42.479 --> 01:19:45.394
And I said,
"Don't worry, mum's the word,

01:19:45.429 --> 01:19:46.799
"but don't let it happen again. "

01:19:46.834 --> 01:19:48.704
Sorry, what am I
supposed to have done?

01:19:48.739 --> 01:19:50.439
Well, you tell me. About what?

01:19:50.474 --> 01:19:53.239
About Sir.
You know who Sir is, Irene.

01:19:53.274 --> 01:19:55.954
I'm late. I have to help
Her Ladyship with her armour.

01:19:55.989 --> 01:19:57.929
Her Ladyship's armour will keep.

01:19:57.964 --> 01:20:00.634
Perhaps you didn't understand
the question.

01:20:00.669 --> 01:20:02.196
What did Sir do?

01:20:02.231 --> 01:20:03.689
I'm not telling you.

01:20:03.724 --> 01:20:05.679
Then I'll mark you for life, ducky.

01:20:05.714 --> 01:20:09.044
You! You strike me
and I'll tell Sir - I will, I will.

01:20:09.079 --> 01:20:10.769
I'll tell Sir, I'll tell Sir.

01:20:10.804 --> 01:20:13.529
Tell Sir? On me?
I quake in my boots.

01:20:13.564 --> 01:20:16.125
I shan't be able to eat my tea.
Oh, tell Sir!

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:19.769
Never mind "tell Sir".
I'll tell YOU.

01:20:19.804 --> 01:20:22.844
He did something,
something unseen and furtive,

01:20:22.879 --> 01:20:25.039
something that gave him pleasure.

01:20:26.995 --> 01:20:29.194
He lifted me up in his arms.

01:20:29.229 --> 01:20:30.519
Lifted you up?

01:20:30.554 --> 01:20:33.634
And I understood,
I understood what he meant.

01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:36.679
"So young, so young," he said,
and lifted me up.

01:20:36.714 --> 01:20:40.544
"That's more like it," he cried,
and I knew, cradled in his arms,

01:20:40.579 --> 01:20:43.169
that it was youth and newness
he was after...

01:20:43.204 --> 01:20:49.125
It's not youth or talent
or star quality he's after, ducky,

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:50.995
but a moderate eater.

01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:52.719
DOOR OPENS

01:20:52.754 --> 01:20:56.009
Oh, there you are.
You're late with my armour.

01:20:56.044 --> 01:20:59.559
Off you go, dear. You'll have
to find another canoe to paddle.

01:21:04.954 --> 01:21:09.687
Ours, I'm afraid... has holes.

01:21:10.884 --> 01:21:13.864
SWORDS CLASH, MEN GRUNT

01:21:20.204 --> 01:21:22.409
HE YELLS

01:21:22.444 --> 01:21:27.474
Be brief in it, to the castle;
For my writ is on the life of Lear

01:21:29.474 --> 01:21:32.853
and on Cordelia.
Nay, send in time.

01:21:34.284 --> 01:21:35.879
Haste thee for thy life.

01:21:35.914 --> 01:21:39.764
You're on. I wish you wouldn't do
that. You remind me of a labourer.

01:21:39.799 --> 01:21:43.995
.. some good I mean to do,
despite of mine own nature.

01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:46.754
Ugh, God Almighty!

01:21:46.789 --> 01:21:48.198
Cue LX.

01:21:50.245 --> 01:21:54.604
TIMPANI PLAYS

01:21:54.639 --> 01:21:57.519
APPLAUSE

01:21:57.554 --> 01:22:00.639
Howl, howl, howl, howl!

01:22:00.674 --> 01:22:06.644
O, you are men of stones. Had I your
tongues and eyes, I'd use them

01:22:06.679 --> 01:22:09.556
so that heaven's vault
should crack.

01:22:11.204 --> 01:22:13.249
She's gone for ever!

01:22:13.284 --> 01:22:18.634
I know when one is dead, and
when one lives. She's dead as earth.

01:22:19.634 --> 01:22:21.879
Lend me a looking-glass;

01:22:21.914 --> 01:22:27.217
If that her breath will mist or stain
the stone, why, then she lives.

01:22:30.844 --> 01:22:34.379
This feather stirs; she lives!

01:22:34.414 --> 01:22:37.684
If it be so, it is a chance
which does redeem all sorrows

01:22:37.719 --> 01:22:39.922
that ever I have felt.

01:22:39.957 --> 01:22:42.375
Is this the promised end?

01:22:42.410 --> 01:22:44.759
Or image of that horror?

01:22:44.794 --> 01:22:50.755
And my poor fool is hang'd.
No, no, no life!

01:22:52.554 --> 01:22:55.995
Why should a dog, a horse, a rat,
have life,

01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:57.405
And thou no breath at all?

01:22:59.344 --> 01:23:01.879
Thou'It come no more,

01:23:01.914 --> 01:23:07.765
Never, never, never, never, never!

01:23:15.115 --> 01:23:17.891
Pray you, undo this button.

01:23:23.604 --> 01:23:28.189
Thank you, sir. Do you see this?

01:23:29.344 --> 01:23:34.166
Look on her, her lips,

01:23:34.201 --> 01:23:38.988
Look there, look there.

01:23:41.344 --> 01:23:43.639
HE GASPS

01:23:43.674 --> 01:23:45.849
Look up, my lord.

01:23:45.884 --> 01:23:49.794
Stand by, curtain down.
O, let him pass. He hates him

01:23:49.829 --> 01:23:52.344
that would upon
the rack of this tough world

01:23:52.379 --> 01:23:54.756
stretch him out longer.
He's gone.

01:23:56.034 --> 01:24:01.314
The weight of this sad time
we must obey. Speak what we feel,

01:24:01.349 --> 01:24:03.316
not what we ought to say.

01:24:04.874 --> 01:24:09.894
The oldest hath borne most,
we that are young

01:24:09.929 --> 01:24:14.915
shall never see so much,
nor live so long.

01:24:17.354 --> 01:24:20.021
Go flies.

01:24:20.056 --> 01:24:22.689
APPLAUSE

01:24:27.604 --> 01:24:31.256
We've done it, Will, we've done it!

01:24:32.964 --> 01:24:35.398
Stand by for your curtain calls.

01:24:37.034 --> 01:24:39.036
Curtain going up.

01:25:12.324 --> 01:25:14.884
What play tomorrow? Richard III.

01:25:16.194 --> 01:25:21.554
Slavery, bloody slavery.
Norman, Norman.

01:25:21.589 --> 01:25:23.279
Sir.

01:25:23.314 --> 01:25:25.239
What will happen to you?

01:25:25.274 --> 01:25:27.128
Can you be a little more explicit?

01:25:28.474 --> 01:25:30.995
What will happen to you
if I cannot continue?

01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:34.180
Oh, stop it.
Nothing ever happens to me.

01:25:34.215 --> 01:25:37.330
I lead a life
entirely without incident.

01:25:38.914 --> 01:25:41.929
But if I should be
unable to continue...

01:25:41.964 --> 01:25:45.354
Well, there's no chance of that
so I'm not bothering to answer.

01:25:45.389 --> 01:25:47.754
I worry about you, my boy. Don't.

01:25:47.789 --> 01:25:50.200
KNOCK AT DOOR
Who?

01:25:50.235 --> 01:25:52.396
Geoffrey. Come. (Oh god.)

01:25:56.964 --> 01:25:59.289
Just popped in to say goodnight,
old man.

01:25:59.324 --> 01:26:03.274
Goodnight, Geoffrey.
Very fine in the storm scene.

01:26:03.309 --> 01:26:06.144
I felt your love,
and that's what matters.

01:26:06.179 --> 01:26:08.929
Oh, thank you.

01:26:08.964 --> 01:26:12.119
Fool is by far the most important
part I've ever played

01:26:12.154 --> 01:26:15.274
in Shakespeare. I hope you feel
I didn't let you down.

01:26:15.309 --> 01:26:19.234
Offer Geoffrey a small
glass of beer, Norman.

01:26:19.269 --> 01:26:20.644
Thank you.

01:26:23.125 --> 01:26:26.289
Well, such an odd feeling tonight,
old man.

01:26:26.324 --> 01:26:31.995
Rather exciting to reach my age
to prove to others that one can act.

01:26:33.995 --> 01:26:37.354
That's the wonderful thing
about this life of ours.

01:26:37.389 --> 01:26:40.562
It's never too late.
Surprising things happen.

01:26:44.234 --> 01:26:46.054
But there are disadvantages.

01:26:46.089 --> 01:26:47.875
One gets the taste for more.

01:26:49.194 --> 01:26:51.765
Cheers. May good health attend you.

01:26:52.865 --> 01:26:55.072
Bottoms up, Geoffrey.

01:27:00.154 --> 01:27:04.970
May I ask you a question, old man?
Ask.

01:27:05.005 --> 01:27:09.729
Fool is a curious role.
You give your all for almost

01:27:09.764 --> 01:27:13.964
an hour-and-a-half, then vanish into
thin air for the rest of the play.

01:27:13.999 --> 01:27:18.794
The next you hear of me
is you saying that I'm hanged.

01:27:18.829 --> 01:27:24.274
But why? By whom?
It seems awfully unfair.

01:27:25.274 --> 01:27:30.739
My theory is that, in William's day,
Fool and Cordelia were played

01:27:30.774 --> 01:27:36.064
by one and the same person. A very
good double, Fool and Cordelia.

01:27:36.099 --> 01:27:41.354
Saved an extra salary, of course.
Well, things haven't changed.

01:27:41.389 --> 01:27:45.135
As long as you feel
I didn't let you down.

01:27:45.170 --> 01:27:46.919
In no particular.

01:27:46.954 --> 01:27:51.139
Just one last thing, I won't keep
you, I know you're very tired.

01:27:51.174 --> 01:27:55.324
But when you interviewed me,
I said that I didn't want too much.

01:27:55.359 --> 01:27:57.360
Small parts, I said.

01:27:59.074 --> 01:28:04.844
It may not be thought admirable,
but I have never put a jot at risk.

01:28:04.879 --> 01:28:08.086
Never wanted to scale the heights.

01:28:09.524 --> 01:28:14.444
Played goodish parts,
tours, of course, never London.

01:28:14.479 --> 01:28:18.019
I don't complain.
Touring's a good life.

01:28:18.054 --> 01:28:23.269
Enjoyed my cricket in summer, hockey
in the winter...

01:28:23.304 --> 01:28:28.484
lovely women, long walks,
a weekly change of scene,

01:28:29.484 --> 01:28:32.885
the English countryside
in all weathers.

01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:34.568
What could be nicer?

01:28:37.284 --> 01:28:38.876
But never risked a jot.

01:28:41.644 --> 01:28:44.135
No, I've been lucky.
Mustn't complain.

01:28:45.995 --> 01:28:48.644
I expect I can get through
to the end of the chapter.

01:28:48.679 --> 01:28:50.559
I've a little put by.

01:28:50.594 --> 01:28:53.358
And my wife brings in a bit
from her singing lessons.

01:28:55.444 --> 01:28:58.936
I've no right to expect work,
not at my age.

01:29:01.574 --> 01:29:06.022
War's brought surprising employment.
All the youngsters at the front.

01:29:07.324 --> 01:29:10.532
My grandson, not a pro...

01:29:12.854 --> 01:29:14.606
.. taken prisoner at Tripoli.

01:29:23.634 --> 01:29:25.819
Sorry to be so long-winded.

01:29:25.854 --> 01:29:30.644
But the point is,
if at any time circumstances arise,

01:29:30.679 --> 01:29:34.434
I should like to be considered
for better parts.

01:29:34.469 --> 01:29:36.846
And I shouldn't want
an increase in salary.

01:29:40.274 --> 01:29:43.774
I shall keep you
in the forefront of my mind.

01:29:43.809 --> 01:29:46.974
Thank you, old man.

01:29:47.009 --> 01:29:50.139
Well... Goodnight.

01:29:52.054 --> 01:29:54.010
Thank you for the drink.

01:29:58.074 --> 01:30:00.281
I can manage. Night, Norman.

01:30:06.954 --> 01:30:08.364
Fine fellow.

01:30:10.294 --> 01:30:12.034
Fine fellow.

01:30:16.875 --> 01:30:20.724
Shall we remove your make-up, Sir?

01:30:20.759 --> 01:30:24.574
I hope Will's pleased tonight.

01:30:24.609 --> 01:30:26.411
I had a friend...

01:30:26.446 --> 01:30:28.179
Not now, Norman.

01:30:28.214 --> 01:30:31.689
I had a friend who had
ever such a sweet singing voice,

01:30:31.724 --> 01:30:36.469
but he lost it in Colwyn Bay
after a bad attack of sea mist.

01:30:36.504 --> 01:30:41.474
But it came back to him again,
in the end, and do you know why?

01:30:41.509 --> 01:30:46.444
Because he said to himself they
also sing who only stand and serve.

01:30:46.479 --> 01:30:48.161
Or words to that effect.

01:30:48.196 --> 01:30:49.895
Are you pissed, Norman?

01:30:49.930 --> 01:30:51.559
Me, Sir? Pissed, Sir?

01:30:51.594 --> 01:30:54.654
Sir Percy, how you do tousle me.

01:30:56.444 --> 01:30:58.036
Let me smell your breath.

01:31:01.204 --> 01:31:04.034
There. Told you.
Sweet as Winston Churchill.

01:31:04.069 --> 01:31:05.724
I can't have you pissed.

01:31:05.759 --> 01:31:07.689
DOOR OPENS

01:31:07.724 --> 01:31:09.578
You not dressed yet?

01:31:11.145 --> 01:31:13.524
I'm a little slow tonight,
Pussy.

01:31:13.559 --> 01:31:15.379
I'm not waiting.

01:31:15.414 --> 01:31:18.734
I'll go back to the digs,
and see if I can get a fire lit.

01:31:18.769 --> 01:31:20.009
I won't be long.

01:31:20.044 --> 01:31:24.895
Goodnight, Norman... I'm not sure
whether I should thank you or not.

01:31:24.930 --> 01:31:27.684
Not. I can't bear to be thanked.

01:31:27.719 --> 01:31:29.413
Goodnight.

01:31:37.284 --> 01:31:39.320
She's a good woman.

01:31:41.444 --> 01:31:43.241
Good woman.

01:31:44.804 --> 01:31:46.681
BANGING ON DOOR

01:31:49.724 --> 01:31:52.295
Who? Mr Oxenby.

01:31:57.584 --> 01:31:59.404
HE SOBS

01:32:01.534 --> 01:32:05.494
What do you want? My manuscript.
He won't read it, I know that.

01:32:05.529 --> 01:32:08.524
Keep your voice down! He's not gone
yet. Just wait there.

01:32:08.559 --> 01:32:09.769
He's a little slow tonight.

01:32:09.804 --> 01:32:13.374
All that struggling and surviving
has tired him, no doubt.

01:32:13.409 --> 01:32:14.689
Please, Mr Oxenby.

01:32:14.724 --> 01:32:17.904
Outmoded hypocrite.
Tell him from me, I look forward

01:32:17.939 --> 01:32:21.084
to a new order.
I want a company without tyrants.

01:32:21.119 --> 01:32:22.934
Who'd be in charge?

01:32:22.969 --> 01:32:24.259
I would.

01:32:24.294 --> 01:32:27.804
You'll be lovely with a bit success,
Mr Oxenby.

01:32:27.839 --> 01:32:31.314
Your nose is browner than usual
tonight, Norman.

01:32:34.044 --> 01:32:36.369
Goodnight, Sir.

01:32:36.404 --> 01:32:38.941
If you hurry,
you'll catch Mr Oxenby.

01:32:44.094 --> 01:32:46.733
HE GROANS

01:32:52.895 --> 01:32:54.730
Sir? AGH!

01:32:54.765 --> 01:33:00.504
Oh, good God! I am tired. Terribly
tired. The room is spinning.

01:33:00.539 --> 01:33:02.539
I must lie down.

01:33:02.574 --> 01:33:06.249
See if you can get me a taxi
in this godforsaken place.

01:33:07.614 --> 01:33:09.689
All in good time.

01:33:09.724 --> 01:33:14.534
Oh, don't cry. Now, don't cry.

01:33:14.569 --> 01:33:16.876
There's nothing left.

01:33:16.911 --> 01:33:19.183
Stop that at once.

01:33:21.804 --> 01:33:23.249
I had a friend...

01:33:23.284 --> 01:33:25.889
Oh, for Christ's sake,
I'm sick of your friends!

01:33:25.924 --> 01:33:30.015
The motley crew they are.
Pathetic, lonely, despairing...

01:33:30.050 --> 01:33:31.619
That's nice, isn't it(?)

01:33:31.654 --> 01:33:35.254
I beg your pardon. Uncalled for.

01:33:35.289 --> 01:33:37.804
Think of me as your friend.

01:33:37.839 --> 01:33:39.901
Never despairing.

01:33:39.936 --> 01:33:41.929
Have apologised.

01:33:41.964 --> 01:33:44.376
Never, never despairing.

01:33:47.324 --> 01:33:51.897
Well, perhaps sometimes. At night.

01:33:53.484 --> 01:33:56.244
Or at Christmas,
when you can't get a job in a panto.

01:33:56.279 --> 01:33:59.259
But never once inside the building.
Never.

01:34:07.814 --> 01:34:11.369
Pathetic maybe, but not ungrateful.

01:34:11.404 --> 01:34:14.899
Too mindful of one's luck,
as the saying goes.

01:34:14.934 --> 01:34:20.895
No duke is more privileged. Here's
beauty, here's spring and summer.

01:34:23.544 --> 01:34:28.026
Here pain is bearable.
And never lonely. Not here.

01:34:29.944 --> 01:34:35.691
For he that sheds his blood today
with me. Soft, no doubt.

01:34:38.174 --> 01:34:42.258
Sensitive - that's my nature.
Easily hurt, but that's a virtue.

01:34:44.664 --> 01:34:47.324
And I'm not here
for any reasons of my own either.

01:34:47.359 --> 01:34:49.730
No-one could accuse me
of base motives.

01:34:49.765 --> 01:34:53.610
I have got what I want
and I don't need anyone to know it.

01:34:58.885 --> 01:35:03.015
Inadequate, yes.
But never, never despairing.

01:35:05.384 --> 01:35:07.181
I've begun My Life.

01:35:10.684 --> 01:35:12.686
Fetch it. The book.

01:35:14.444 --> 01:35:15.490
I made a start...

01:35:25.624 --> 01:35:27.974
You didn't get very far...

01:35:28.009 --> 01:35:29.590
What did I write?

01:35:29.625 --> 01:35:31.172
"My Life. Dedication.

01:35:34.404 --> 01:35:38.294
"This book is dedicated
to my beloved Pussy,

01:35:38.329 --> 01:35:40.740
"who has been my splendid spur.

01:35:42.544 --> 01:35:45.614
"To the spirit of all actors
because of their faith

01:35:45.649 --> 01:35:48.740
"and endurance
which never fails them.

01:35:48.775 --> 01:35:51.214
"To those who do
the work of the theatre yet have

01:35:51.249 --> 01:35:53.659
"but small share in the glory.

01:35:53.694 --> 01:35:58.009
"The carpenters, electricians,
scene-shifters, property men.

01:35:58.044 --> 01:36:02.324
"To the audiences, who have laughed
with us, have wept with us

01:36:02.359 --> 01:36:04.824
"and whose hearts have united
with ours

01:36:04.859 --> 01:36:06.814
"in sympathy and understanding. "

01:36:06.849 --> 01:36:09.304
"But finally... "

01:36:09.339 --> 01:36:11.909
ah, Sir,

01:36:11.944 --> 01:36:14.981
"to the memory
of William Shakespeare...

01:36:16.674 --> 01:36:19.427
".. in whose glorious service
we all labour. "

01:36:23.294 --> 01:36:25.455
My Life will have to do.

01:36:33.054 --> 01:36:37.218
Wait a moment, wait a moment...

01:36:39.544 --> 01:36:42.342
"The carpenters, electricians,
scene-shifters... "

01:36:43.814 --> 01:36:44.849
Sir?

01:36:46.374 --> 01:36:47.568
Sir...

01:36:51.944 --> 01:36:53.309
Sir?

01:37:00.283 --> 01:37:01.523
Sir...

01:37:05.013 --> 01:37:06.731
We're not dead, are we?

01:37:08.333 --> 01:37:10.289
That's your cue.
You know the line.

01:37:12.013 --> 01:37:14.533
"You lie! Jack Clinton... "

01:37:14.568 --> 01:37:16.376
"lives!"

01:37:19.573 --> 01:37:21.177
Talk about untoward.

01:37:25.283 --> 01:37:29.333
Ooh... You're right.
The room is spinning.

01:37:31.143 --> 01:37:32.701
Your Ladyship!

01:37:37.063 --> 01:37:39.623
MADGE!

01:37:43.493 --> 01:37:45.328
Anybody!

01:37:45.363 --> 01:37:48.389
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

01:38:24.653 --> 01:38:27.943
Wasn't much of a death scene.

01:38:27.978 --> 01:38:29.592
Unremarkable.

01:38:31.943 --> 01:38:35.573
And ever so short.
For him.

01:38:35.608 --> 01:38:37.370
Where's Her Ladyship?

01:38:38.864 --> 01:38:42.864
They all left before he did.
Couldn't wait.

01:38:42.899 --> 01:38:44.183
I'll telephone her.

01:38:45.813 --> 01:38:47.418
And I'll get a doctor.

01:38:47.453 --> 01:38:49.349
Too late for a doctor, ducky.

01:38:49.384 --> 01:38:51.245
What's going to happen to me?

01:38:52.864 --> 01:38:55.083
Close the door. Wait outside.

01:38:55.118 --> 01:38:57.268
I don't want to wait outside.

01:38:57.303 --> 01:39:00.783
I NEVER wait outside.
I want to be with HIM.

01:39:00.818 --> 01:39:02.865
I know my place, ducky.

01:39:06.093 --> 01:39:07.458
Try and sober up.

01:39:08.583 --> 01:39:10.312
Ambulance, please.

01:39:14.734 --> 01:39:19.573
"Carpenters, electricians,
property men"? You cruel bastard.

01:39:19.608 --> 01:39:21.188
You might have remembered.

01:39:21.223 --> 01:39:24.778
Yes, Your Ladyship, it's Madge.

01:39:24.813 --> 01:39:28.351
I was wondering if you could come
to the theatre.

01:39:39.453 --> 01:39:41.444
MADGE HANGS UP PHONE

01:39:44.943 --> 01:39:46.774
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

01:39:51.878 --> 01:39:54.687
Her Ladyship's coming at once.
She took it very calmly.

01:39:54.722 --> 01:39:57.908
She asked for him
to be covered in his Lear cloak.

01:39:57.943 --> 01:40:00.312
Covered in his Lear cloak?

01:40:00.347 --> 01:40:02.277
Ooh! Fetch the photographers, ducky.

01:40:02.312 --> 01:40:03.922
Covered in his Lear cloak?

01:40:03.957 --> 01:40:07.207
This isn't the Death of Nelson,
you know.

01:40:07.242 --> 01:40:08.595
Where is it?

01:40:46.784 --> 01:40:49.969
There's no mention
of stage managers either.

01:40:52.234 --> 01:40:53.940
Come out of here.

01:40:55.584 --> 01:40:57.619
Are we going to get paid?

01:40:57.654 --> 01:41:02.277
I mean, is there money in the till
after deductions for income tax?

01:41:02.312 --> 01:41:04.792
We've got to be paid
for the full week, you know.

01:41:04.827 --> 01:41:07.908
Just because a man dies
on Thursday doesn't mean to say

01:41:07.943 --> 01:41:09.137
we get paid pro rata.

01:41:09.172 --> 01:41:10.863
Come away.

01:41:10.898 --> 01:41:12.766
Where will I go?

01:41:12.801 --> 01:41:18.091
Where?
I'm nowhere... out of my element.

01:41:19.353 --> 01:41:23.653
I don't want to end up running
a boarding house in Colwyn Bay.

01:41:25.973 --> 01:41:27.634
What am I going to do?

01:41:28.803 --> 01:41:30.358
You can speak well of him.

01:41:30.393 --> 01:41:31.878
Speak well of THAT old sod?

01:41:31.913 --> 01:41:36.313
I wouldn't give him a good
character, not in a court of law.

01:41:36.348 --> 01:41:38.163
The ungrateful bastard.

01:41:38.198 --> 01:41:39.878
Get out. Get out!

01:41:39.913 --> 01:41:41.128
I don't want you in here.

01:41:41.163 --> 01:41:43.813
Holy, holy, holy, is it?
This isn't a shrine!

01:41:43.848 --> 01:41:45.923
No pissing on the altar.

01:41:45.958 --> 01:41:47.561
Stop it.

01:41:57.333 --> 01:41:59.690
Speak well of him?
I know what YOU'D say.

01:41:59.725 --> 01:42:01.328
I know all about YOU, ducky.

01:42:03.250 --> 01:42:05.115
I have eyes in my head.

01:42:05.150 --> 01:42:07.055
We all have our little sorrows.

01:42:07.090 --> 01:42:13.000
I know what you'd say - stiff upper,
faithful, loyal, loving.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.605
Well, I have only one thing to say
about him

01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:20.790
and I wouldn't say it in front
of you, or Her Ladyship, or anyone.

01:42:20.825 --> 01:42:25.634
Lips tight shut. I wouldn't give you
the pleasure. Or him.

01:42:25.669 --> 01:42:26.599
Especially not him.

01:42:26.634 --> 01:42:30.283
If I said what I have to say, he'd
find a way to take it out on me.

01:42:30.318 --> 01:42:32.285
No-one will ever know.

01:42:34.634 --> 01:42:36.953
We all have our little sorrows,
ducky...

01:42:36.988 --> 01:42:38.358
You're not the only one.

01:42:38.393 --> 01:42:43.717
The littler you are,
the larger your sorrows.

01:42:46.403 --> 01:42:47.847
You think you loved him?

01:42:50.173 --> 01:42:51.652
What about me?

01:43:07.083 --> 01:43:11.361
Oh, this is no place for death.

01:43:13.357 --> 01:43:14.710
I had a friend...
