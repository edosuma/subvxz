WEBVTT

00:00.250 --> 00:03.333
I gotta get goin'

00:03.333 --> 00:06.875
a friend of mine

00:08.458 --> 00:11.458
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.000 --> 00:17.458
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.458 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:27.875
we're so adventurous

00:27.875 --> 00:31.291
and again

00:31.291 --> 00:34.750
and there's nobody home

00:34.750 --> 00:38.208
to count on a friend

00:38.208 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.750 --> 00:45.250
take me, please?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.625
I got to be there

00:50.708 --> 00:55.875
Winnie the Pooh

01:13.875 --> 01:15.083
Tigger: Foul ball!

01:15.083 --> 01:16.416
Rabbit: No shoving!

01:16.416 --> 01:18.708
Whoops! There it goes!

01:18.708 --> 01:20.208
Don't let it get away.

01:20.208 --> 01:21.458
Oh, dear.

01:32.083 --> 01:34.875
We're-- We're stuck.

01:34.875 --> 01:38.000
Hmm. A sneaky
little guy, isn't he?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.375
Are we having
a time out?

01:40.375 --> 01:44.083
Come on, you persnickety
little sphere.

01:44.083 --> 01:46.083
Come to Papa.

01:46.083 --> 01:47.500
Hand it off!

01:49.208 --> 01:52.291
Dag nabbit! I can't
wait around all day.

01:52.291 --> 01:54.125
I got things to thingie,

01:54.125 --> 01:56.458
places to replace, and--

01:56.458 --> 01:59.708
Aah!

02:04.125 --> 02:05.458
Rabbit: There it goes.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.708
- Tigger: Pass it!
- Piglet: Catch it.

02:11.083 --> 02:14.875
I get the feeling
it's time to move.

02:14.875 --> 02:17.833
Well, there's no use
complaining,

02:17.833 --> 02:20.083
not that I ever do.

02:20.083 --> 02:21.416
Oh, dear.

02:23.166 --> 02:26.125
Feet together,
left arm straight,
head down.

02:27.958 --> 02:30.125
Well played, Piglet. Ha ha!

02:30.125 --> 02:31.583
Nice shot.

02:31.583 --> 02:33.125
Was that a goal, Pooh?

02:33.125 --> 02:36.083
Yeah, Pooh boy.
You're the referee.

02:36.083 --> 02:38.166
You decide
all the important stuff.

02:39.166 --> 02:40.458
Oh.

02:40.458 --> 02:42.708
Well, I think it was
as close to being a goal

02:42.708 --> 02:45.625
as it could be
without being close at all.

02:45.625 --> 02:47.000
Thank you, Pooh.

02:48.208 --> 02:49.708
There goes the ball!

02:49.708 --> 02:52.583
No ball's going to get
the bounce on me.

02:54.125 --> 02:57.875
Now I gotcha,
you ornery little orb.

02:57.875 --> 03:00.750
Hurry, Tigger,
it's getting away.

03:00.750 --> 03:03.500
Don't worry, Rabbit.
I got it on the run.

03:03.500 --> 03:04.875
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

03:06.333 --> 03:08.000
Why, hello, ball.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.208
- We've got it cornered.
- Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

03:09.208 --> 03:11.208
Oh, my goodness.

03:11.208 --> 03:14.833
I think it would
be safer if you left.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.500
This certainly seems

03:17.500 --> 03:20.000
like a good place
for my house.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Hawmp!

03:21.000 --> 03:22.208
But then again,

03:22.208 --> 03:24.875
it never hurts
to keep looking.

03:24.875 --> 03:27.416
Why did you do that,
Pooh Bear?

03:27.416 --> 03:30.125
Don't you know what it
means to be the referee?

03:30.125 --> 03:32.458
Of course I do, Rabbit.

03:32.458 --> 03:35.083
It means
I'm on the ball's side.

03:35.083 --> 03:37.458
I'm glad you're on
its side, Pooh.

03:37.458 --> 03:39.000
No, no, no, no.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.166
The ball doesn't
have Pooh on its side.

03:42.166 --> 03:43.875
How do you know,
bunny boy?

03:43.875 --> 03:45.500
They look pretty
friendly to me.

03:45.500 --> 03:48.500
I know because
I wrote the rules.

03:48.500 --> 03:51.875
Oh, yeah? So what do
the rules say, long ears?

03:51.875 --> 03:53.875
Uh, oh, yes, the rules.

03:53.875 --> 03:57.583
Well, uh, the rules say--
uh, well...

03:57.583 --> 03:59.875
Get that ball!

03:59.875 --> 04:01.416
Dag nabbit!

04:01.416 --> 04:03.875
The trouble with all this
fun and games stuff

04:03.875 --> 04:06.125
is that it takes too long.

04:06.125 --> 04:07.708
I got things to do.

04:07.708 --> 04:12.458
Hmm. Now where did I put
that blasted first--

04:12.458 --> 04:14.708
Aah!

04:16.458 --> 04:18.000
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

04:18.000 --> 04:21.083
One little swipe,
and the game's over.

04:21.083 --> 04:23.000
Wait. Stop. Don't hit it.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.875
Uh, where's Gopher?

04:24.875 --> 04:29.083
The rules say you can't score
unless the goalie is here.

04:29.083 --> 04:30.500
What do we do now,
Pooh?

04:30.500 --> 04:35.500
Perhaps a time out
for a small smackerel.

04:35.500 --> 04:39.208
Exactly, Pooh. A time out.

04:39.208 --> 04:41.125
But not
for smackereling.

04:41.125 --> 04:43.708
We must have
a team meeting.

04:43.708 --> 04:46.375
But haven't we met
each other already?

04:46.375 --> 04:47.958
Oh, my.

04:49.166 --> 04:50.708
Rabbit: Order, order.

04:50.708 --> 04:53.875
Ahem. I call this team
meeting to order.

04:53.875 --> 04:56.750
There.
Now we're all here.

04:56.750 --> 05:00.375
Where's Gopher? We can't
stop the meeting without him.

05:03.583 --> 05:05.875
Jumpin' crawdaddies!

05:05.875 --> 05:08.750
How's a guy supposed
to get any work done

05:08.750 --> 05:11.250
with all this
playing going on?

05:11.250 --> 05:13.583
But, Gopher, we can't
play without you.

05:13.583 --> 05:16.625
I had enough fun
and relaxation.

05:16.625 --> 05:21.333
I got a whole system
of subterranean
shortcuts to build.

05:21.333 --> 05:22.708
But the rules say

05:22.708 --> 05:25.000
we can't finish the game
without a goalie.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
- I have to work.
- Play.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
- Work.
- Play!

05:28.000 --> 05:29.083
Work!

05:29.083 --> 05:30.291
Uh, Pooh,

05:30.291 --> 05:31.500
you're the referee.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.125
What do you think
we should do?

05:33.125 --> 05:35.166
Yeah. You tell 'em,
buddy bear.

05:35.166 --> 05:37.833
Yes, Pooh.
Should we play?

05:37.833 --> 05:38.875
Or work?

05:40.166 --> 05:41.583
Mm.

05:41.583 --> 05:42.583
Yes.

05:42.583 --> 05:44.416
Both: Yes?

05:44.416 --> 05:48.125
By dinghy, that
makes sense to me.

05:48.125 --> 05:50.375
Right. We'll do both.

05:50.375 --> 05:53.458
All right, Gopher,
we'll help you work.

05:53.458 --> 05:55.500
Gopher: And I'll
help you play.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.125
My first shortcut
wasn't short enough,

06:00.125 --> 06:03.000
so I'm going to have to cut
another shortcut around it.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.375
Well, whatever we do,
let's do it

06:05.375 --> 06:07.458
so we can get
back to the game.

06:07.458 --> 06:11.250
Gonna need some rocks
for a retaining wall.

06:11.250 --> 06:13.583
Safety first, you know.

06:13.583 --> 06:16.458
Perhaps we could
use this, Gopher?

06:16.458 --> 06:17.875
Nope, nope,
not that one.

06:17.875 --> 06:19.125
No, siree.

06:19.125 --> 06:22.083
That's my pride and joy.

06:22.083 --> 06:23.750
Best boulder I ever built.

06:23.750 --> 06:27.125
I'm saving it
for something special.

06:27.125 --> 06:30.000
Maybe one of these would do?

06:30.000 --> 06:32.208
- Oh, bother.

06:34.166 --> 06:36.250
Head for the hills!

06:36.250 --> 06:38.500
- Gangway!
- Retreat!

06:38.500 --> 06:40.166
Yipes!

06:48.500 --> 06:50.875
I think we lost it.

06:54.875 --> 06:56.708
I think it found us.

07:03.708 --> 07:05.583
Follow me.

07:12.708 --> 07:15.500
Hmm. Not bad
for an oversized marble.

07:15.500 --> 07:18.875
Now this is what I
call a shortcut.

07:18.875 --> 07:20.875
Then that takes care
of the working.

07:20.875 --> 07:23.416
And now we can get
back to the game.

07:23.416 --> 07:26.583
All the modern conveniences--

07:26.583 --> 07:29.208
impressive yet tasteful.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.500
But not too sturdy.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.125
Heads up, Piglet.

07:42.125 --> 07:43.875
I got it. I got it. Oof!

07:49.333 --> 07:51.875
Hey, little Piglet,
where's the ball?

07:51.875 --> 07:53.458
I didn't get it.

07:53.458 --> 07:55.875
Here we go again.

07:55.875 --> 07:57.708
Nothing but a waste of time.

07:57.708 --> 07:59.291
- Say,

07:59.291 --> 08:02.458
what's all the ruckus about?

08:04.958 --> 08:08.583
Hey! Watch it,
you dad-blasted ball!

08:08.583 --> 08:11.958
Ball? Heh heh. I got the ball.

08:11.958 --> 08:15.416
All right, you lollygaggers,

08:15.416 --> 08:19.291
now you're going to see
some real Gopher goalieing.

08:31.375 --> 08:32.958
- Oh, dear.

08:32.958 --> 08:34.208
It took the ball.

08:34.208 --> 08:36.208
Gopher: Spoilsport!

08:36.208 --> 08:40.458
The rules! The rules!
It's against the rules!

08:40.458 --> 08:43.333
If we don't
get that ball back,

08:43.333 --> 08:45.458
we'll never stop playing.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.750
And we'll never
get back to work.

08:47.750 --> 08:50.125
And we'll run
out of time outs.

08:50.125 --> 08:52.208
After that ball!

09:08.208 --> 09:09.583
What shall we
do now?

09:09.583 --> 09:12.000
There's only one thing to do.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.500
We'll call a team meeting
and decide what to do.

09:16.500 --> 09:18.333
The rules clearly state

09:18.333 --> 09:21.833
that the game's not over
until the game is finished.

09:21.833 --> 09:24.625
And we can't finish
without a ball.

09:24.625 --> 09:26.708
Gopher,
it's your boulder.

09:26.708 --> 09:28.708
You tell us where it
took the ball.

09:28.708 --> 09:30.458
Matter of fact, I can.

09:30.458 --> 09:33.250
Ahem. Taking into account
velocity, gravity,

09:33.250 --> 09:35.708
and the hypotenuse
of any right triangle,

09:35.708 --> 09:38.416
I calculate it's going
to come to a stop

09:38.416 --> 09:40.125
right about there.

09:41.708 --> 09:43.333
Come in.

09:45.458 --> 09:48.125
Oh, no! My vegetables!

09:49.875 --> 09:53.708
Of course, that's after it
passes through your garden.

09:53.708 --> 09:56.250
So when will it
get to there?

09:56.250 --> 10:00.583
Oh, in, uh, say,
35 seconds.

10:02.083 --> 10:05.708
Then why don't we
make there the goal?

10:05.708 --> 10:09.083
Nice house in a quiet
neighborhood.

10:09.083 --> 10:11.875
What more
could a donkey want?

10:11.875 --> 10:12.875
Huh?

10:15.291 --> 10:16.875
Yikes.

10:20.125 --> 10:21.958
Well, Pooh?

10:23.583 --> 10:26.000
Why, it's a goal.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.416
Then, according to the rules,
the game is over.

10:29.416 --> 10:31.708
Leave it to old
donkey boy here

10:31.708 --> 10:34.458
to show up
in the right place
at the right time.

10:34.458 --> 10:38.166
It's a talent we donkeys
don't like to brag about.

10:38.166 --> 10:43.083
Why, Eeyore, a stick has
fallen from your home.

10:45.250 --> 10:46.833
Oh, bother.

10:48.958 --> 10:50.458
Oh, dear.

10:56.333 --> 11:00.166
Eeyore, I'm very sorry.

11:00.166 --> 11:02.166
Aren't I?

11:02.166 --> 11:04.458
No need to be, Pooh.

11:04.458 --> 11:06.875
It's all the house
I ever needed.

11:06.875 --> 11:10.000
Say, long ears,
what was the score?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.875
That's a very good
question, Tigger.

11:12.875 --> 11:15.458
What was the score,
Pooh?

11:15.458 --> 11:16.833
Score?

11:16.833 --> 11:20.125
But, Rabbit,
Pooh can't count.

11:20.125 --> 11:22.958
Then according to the rules,
we have to play tomorrow

11:22.958 --> 11:24.875
to figure out today's score.

11:24.875 --> 11:27.166
Tigger: What'll we
use for a ball?

11:27.166 --> 11:28.625
Gopher:
Ah, don't worry.

11:28.625 --> 11:31.000
We'll find something.

11:45.583 --> 11:47.000
Hiya, buddy bear!

11:47.000 --> 11:50.125
How about some fun
and frolics and stuff?

11:50.125 --> 11:52.000
I can't now, Tigger.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.625
I'm cleaning
my empty honey pots.

11:54.625 --> 11:56.708
before I fill them again

11:56.708 --> 11:58.583
so I can empty them again.

12:00.416 --> 12:02.208
I'll bet Pigalet can play.

12:02.208 --> 12:04.208
He's always got time
for a friend.

12:05.208 --> 12:06.416
Oh, bother.

12:06.416 --> 12:09.458
I must have pumped
the pump too hard.

12:09.458 --> 12:12.208
Perhaps it's gone off
to take a nap.

12:16.208 --> 12:17.500
Let me see.

12:17.500 --> 12:20.000
A carrot caddy for Rabbit,

12:20.000 --> 12:22.500
a honey pot warmer
for Pooh Bear--

12:22.500 --> 12:24.708
- Hiya, little Pigalet!
- Yipes!

12:24.708 --> 12:28.125
What say you and me go hunting
heffalumps or something?

12:28.125 --> 12:29.583
I can't now, Tigger.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.208
I'm making up
my Christmas list.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.708
But it's only half past
springtime.

12:33.708 --> 12:37.750
Well, I have so many friends
that it's a very long list.

12:37.750 --> 12:39.875
Maybe old long ears will
want to have some fun.

12:41.833 --> 12:44.583
I hope I get this done before
it gets too dark to see.

12:46.958 --> 12:49.708
Oh, my. That's much better.

12:49.708 --> 12:51.000
I think.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.208
I certainly

12:53.208 --> 12:54.875
do not want to play, Tigger.

12:54.875 --> 12:58.250
As you can see, I'm very
busy with my gardening.

12:58.250 --> 13:02.125
I guess nobody wants to do
any playing with me today.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.375
Oh, my.

13:08.708 --> 13:10.500
Oh, my, oh, my.

13:10.500 --> 13:14.458
Everybody's too--
-- for me.

13:14.458 --> 13:16.708
If I bounced up
and never came down,

13:16.708 --> 13:19.750
nobody would even notice
the extra space.

13:19.750 --> 13:24.208
Say, even my door's being--
-- unfriendly.

13:26.416 --> 13:28.708
If I don't get
this thing unstuck--

13:28.708 --> 13:31.083
huh-- I'll be stuck
out there forever.

13:31.083 --> 13:32.583
I'm gonna get in there

13:32.583 --> 13:35.583
if it's the last thing
I do-hoo-hoo-hoo!

13:42.000 --> 13:45.625
Say, do I hear teensy
little insecty footsteps

13:45.625 --> 13:46.958
of the bug variety?

13:50.875 --> 13:53.708
Hmm. Looks like I got
a houseguest.

13:55.416 --> 13:59.125
Why, it must be a blue-faced,
yellow-bellied housefly.

13:59.125 --> 14:00.708
Hiya, little fella.

14:00.708 --> 14:03.083
My name's Tigger.
What's yours?

14:04.083 --> 14:06.250
The shy type, no doubt.

14:06.250 --> 14:08.208
That's okay, kid.

14:08.208 --> 14:10.958
You and me are gonna
be best friends.

14:10.958 --> 14:13.125
We'll go places
and do things

14:13.125 --> 14:16.000
like going to walks,
playing marbles,

14:16.000 --> 14:18.375
singing songs
in four-part harmony,

14:18.375 --> 14:20.458
just the two of us.

14:22.625 --> 14:24.375
We'll have a ton of fun,

14:24.375 --> 14:26.000
and when we're done--
--

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
we'll have some more.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.875
Having fun with friends
is what tiggers do the best.

14:30.875 --> 14:32.083
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

14:34.125 --> 14:37.500
There's something very
strange going on here.

14:37.500 --> 14:40.250
Say, everybody,
I want to introduce you

14:40.250 --> 14:41.875
to my new friend.

14:41.875 --> 14:45.000
Not now, Tigger. We have
a crisis to resolve.

14:46.583 --> 14:49.333
Do you see
Tigger's new friend?

14:49.333 --> 14:52.833
Well, uh, no,
not exactly. Do you?

14:52.833 --> 14:55.416
Not very well, I'm afraid.

14:55.416 --> 14:57.708
We must find out
what's happening

14:57.708 --> 14:59.708
to all the wood in the Wood.

14:59.708 --> 15:04.208
Hmm. Let's you and me go
have some friend-type fun.

15:04.208 --> 15:06.500
TTFN.

15:06.500 --> 15:09.875
Uh, Tigger seems
to have a new friend

15:09.875 --> 15:11.833
only Tigger can see.

15:11.833 --> 15:14.708
Why would Tigger need
a new friend when he has us?

15:14.708 --> 15:19.000
Well, if the friend
he likes best isn't,

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
then the friends
who like him best

15:21.000 --> 15:23.291
must be...friendlier.

15:24.333 --> 15:25.833
Why, Pooh,

15:25.833 --> 15:29.250
I believe that's
a very friendly idea.

15:29.250 --> 15:31.000
Poor little guy,

15:31.000 --> 15:34.583
out there all alone
on that big, cruel world

15:34.583 --> 15:36.875
and nobody watching
where they're stepping.

15:36.875 --> 15:39.416
-- okay.

15:40.583 --> 15:42.125
You're home.

15:42.125 --> 15:43.958
I'm never letting you
out of my sight again

15:43.958 --> 15:47.125
because you're the best
pal a tigger ever had.

15:47.125 --> 15:48.875
Hello, friend Tigger.

15:48.875 --> 15:50.583
I've brought you a small gift.

15:52.500 --> 15:54.291
And I brought you these,
Tigger.

15:54.291 --> 15:57.708
It's the sort of things
friends do for their friends.

15:57.708 --> 15:59.416
Glad you dropped by.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.708
Now you can meet
my new friend.

16:03.250 --> 16:05.166
How do you do?

16:05.166 --> 16:09.583
I'm Pooh, and this is
my friend Piglet.

16:09.583 --> 16:11.583
It's very nice to meet you.

16:11.583 --> 16:14.250
Say, who you guys
talking to?

16:14.250 --> 16:17.291
My friend's not there.
He's over-- Gasp!

16:17.291 --> 16:18.250
He's gone again!

16:18.250 --> 16:20.166
I've got to find him!

16:20.166 --> 16:21.958
Poor Tigger has imagined

16:21.958 --> 16:24.416
that his imaginary friend
has run away.

16:24.416 --> 16:28.291
Yes. It seems this is
worse than we'd imagined.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.333
Piglet: Oh, poor Tigger.
What shall we do?

16:32.333 --> 16:36.000
What is it that's chewing
everything into sawdust?

16:36.000 --> 16:38.875
Chewing? Are we going
to have breakfast?

16:38.875 --> 16:41.166
We have to do something.

16:41.166 --> 16:44.000
Yes. Something sweet.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.708
I believe we must
convince Tigger

16:45.708 --> 16:47.500
his friend isn't real.

16:47.500 --> 16:50.333
Is Tigger's unfriend
coming to breakfast?

16:50.333 --> 16:52.875
Uh, Pooh Bear,
I'm talking about

16:52.875 --> 16:55.125
the strange goings-on
in the forest.

16:55.125 --> 16:58.458
Something very unusual
is happening,

16:58.458 --> 17:00.958
and I'm going to get
to the bottom of-- this!

17:02.333 --> 17:04.125
Aha!

17:04.125 --> 17:07.166
The mystery is solved.

17:07.166 --> 17:12.208
Ahem. After a great deal
of research on my part,

17:12.208 --> 17:13.875
- I--
- Hey, everybody!

17:13.875 --> 17:16.000
I found my little--
- Not now, Tigger.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.708
Ahem. As I was saying,

17:19.708 --> 17:23.583
I have discovered what's
responsible for our problem,

17:23.583 --> 17:25.708
and it is...

17:25.708 --> 17:27.750
a termite.

17:27.750 --> 17:29.125
Hmm.

17:29.125 --> 17:31.125
Bears a remarkabibble
resemblance

17:31.125 --> 17:33.875
to a blue-faced,
yellow-bellied housefly.

17:33.875 --> 17:36.875
We must find this
terrible termite

17:36.875 --> 17:39.083
before it eats us
out of house and home.

17:39.083 --> 17:40.375
And honey.

17:40.375 --> 17:41.833
Me and my little friend

17:41.833 --> 17:44.875
will find that villainous
villain for you.

17:44.875 --> 17:47.000
I'll bet he's already
hot on the trail.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.708
Wait for me, little guy.

17:48.708 --> 17:51.250
Let's find that termite.

17:51.250 --> 17:54.000
And invite him to breakfast.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.250
Here, Mr. Termite.

17:56.250 --> 17:59.083
I know you're here somewhere.

17:59.083 --> 18:00.458
Aren't you?

18:16.083 --> 18:19.583
Perhaps the termite has
come back here for dessert.

18:19.583 --> 18:21.208
My house is getting taller,

18:21.208 --> 18:23.000
or I'm getting even smaller.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.875
Have you seen the termite,
Piglet?

18:25.875 --> 18:29.083
Why, yes, Pooh.
I believe I have.

18:29.083 --> 18:30.583
There he goes!

18:30.583 --> 18:33.291
He's headed straight
for Tigger's house.

18:37.416 --> 18:38.583
Hiya, fellas!

18:38.583 --> 18:41.083
Did you find
that dastardly termite?

18:41.083 --> 18:43.000
- Oof.

18:44.458 --> 18:45.625
There it is.

18:46.708 --> 18:48.125
Say,

18:48.125 --> 18:49.958
what are you doing
chasing my friend?

18:49.958 --> 18:52.291
Thought you were after
some terribibble termite.

18:52.291 --> 18:54.583
But that
is the termite.

18:54.583 --> 18:56.208
That's ridickerous.

18:57.583 --> 19:00.250
This is a blue-faced,
yellow-bellied housefly.

19:00.250 --> 19:01.875
My friend.

19:01.875 --> 19:05.458
Why, do you realize
what this means?

19:05.458 --> 19:08.416
Yes. It means
Tigger's friend

19:08.416 --> 19:10.958
is a bit more real
than we imagined.

19:10.958 --> 19:13.958
That thing is a menace
to the Hundred Acre Wood.

19:13.958 --> 19:15.458
It has to go.

19:15.458 --> 19:17.458
Huh-uh. No way. No how.

19:17.458 --> 19:21.083
He's my friend, and I'm
not sending him packing.

19:24.458 --> 19:25.875
Don't worry, little guy.

19:25.875 --> 19:27.083
I'll protect you.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.166
But, Tigger,

19:28.166 --> 19:31.375
that creature
must go and now.

19:31.375 --> 19:33.375
He's eaten the fence
around my garden,

19:33.375 --> 19:35.000
Piglet's chair,
Pooh's table--

19:35.000 --> 19:36.291
Yeah, but-- but--

19:36.291 --> 19:37.958
No buts, Tigger.

19:37.958 --> 19:40.333
That termite must go.

19:40.333 --> 19:42.500
Okay.

19:42.500 --> 19:44.750
If that's the way
it's got to be.

19:44.750 --> 19:48.583
Good. I'm glad you're finally
listening to reason.

19:48.583 --> 19:52.208
--
move away with him.

19:52.208 --> 19:55.833
I can't let the poor
little guy go alone.

19:55.833 --> 19:58.708
Mm, uh, I mean, Tigger,

19:58.708 --> 20:01.125
you don't have to leave,
too, do you?

20:01.125 --> 20:03.583
This is how it must be.

20:03.583 --> 20:06.958
I'll go away forever
and maybe even longer--

20:06.958 --> 20:09.750
just me and you.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.208
-- gone.

20:12.208 --> 20:15.208
Why, he must have heard
the terribibble things
you were saying

20:15.208 --> 20:17.333
and got his itty-bitty
bug feelings hurt.

20:17.333 --> 20:19.750
Hurt feelings, indeed.

20:19.750 --> 20:21.875
I'll bet the little
monster's out there

20:21.875 --> 20:23.708
eating what's left
of our homes.

20:23.708 --> 20:25.875
We have to stop
that thing.

20:27.416 --> 20:29.458
He must be around
here somewhere.

20:38.250 --> 20:40.583
I knew it. It's him.

20:43.583 --> 20:46.083
Why, what's he doing?

20:46.083 --> 20:51.125
Pooh: I believe he's fixing
what he unfixed, Rabbit.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.333
Thanks, little fella.

20:55.333 --> 20:57.708
He caught my good side. Coo!

20:57.708 --> 20:59.208
Hey!

20:59.208 --> 21:00.333
Where ya going?

21:00.333 --> 21:01.875
Come back!

21:01.875 --> 21:05.250
So long, little--
-- bug buddy.

21:17.250 --> 21:20.000
We just want you to know
that we're still your friends.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.500
And that you're
welcome to breakfast

21:22.500 --> 21:25.250
any time it's time
for breakfast.

21:25.250 --> 21:27.000
Uh, what time is it?

21:27.000 --> 21:28.833
Ah, I know that.

21:28.833 --> 21:34.375
And, uh, Tigger, I am sorry
about your little, uh, friend.

21:34.375 --> 21:36.083
Ah, don't worry
about it.

21:36.083 --> 21:37.750
Why, you're just
in time to see.

21:37.750 --> 21:39.875
I had so much fun
with one bug,

21:39.875 --> 21:42.083
I figured it would be
ten times as much fun

21:42.083 --> 21:43.250
with ten of them.

21:43.250 --> 21:46.166
So meet my new friends.

21:46.166 --> 21:49.083
Why, Tigger, aren't those--

21:49.083 --> 21:50.583
Fleas?

21:50.583 --> 21:53.125
Yeah. I'm gonna
start a circus.

21:53.125 --> 21:54.875
Okay, fellas,

21:54.875 --> 21:56.625
show them how you can
jump through the hoop.

21:56.625 --> 21:58.958
Say, where'd they
all go?

22:03.625 --> 22:05.625
I heard of close friends,

22:05.625 --> 22:09.166
but this is too close.
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!
