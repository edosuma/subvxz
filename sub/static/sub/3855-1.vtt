00:42.520 --> 00:44.670
Zoom in... even more.

00:44.880 --> 00:48.589
Keep going... Pan right a bit...

00:48.800 --> 00:50.472
There. That's it.

00:50.680 --> 00:52.636
Quiet please!

00:52.840 --> 00:54.717
Rolling...

00:59.600 --> 01:01.716
Camera!

01:01.920 --> 01:03.876
Take!

19:43.440 --> 19:45.032
What is it?

19:45.240 --> 19:51.190
Nothing. I just thought of something
from my childhood.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.198
It was some sort of punishment.

19:54.400 --> 19:57.073
They threw me into a closet.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.430
And shut the door.

19:59.640 --> 20:04.156
It got quiet and dark.
I was horribly scared.

20:04.360 --> 20:06.476
I kicked and pounded, -

20:06.680 --> 20:11.390
- because they had told me that
a little person lived in that closet.

21:10.920 --> 21:14.549
IS YOUR HAND IN MINE?

21:14.760 --> 21:18.355
PINGMAR

23:48.120 --> 23:50.588
What are you doing today?

23:53.440 --> 23:57.228
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

24:00.960 --> 24:03.349
But I asked you.

26:02.400 --> 26:05.233
No, you are strangling me...

26:49.400 --> 26:53.029
Poor Anna.
You were so happy before we met.

26:53.240 --> 26:57.233
I had happy memories
of my husband and our love.

26:57.440 --> 27:00.557
- And now that's missing.
- I lived in truth.

27:00.760 --> 27:04.070
- Really?
- You destroyed it with lies.

27:04.280 --> 27:06.999
- Stop it.
- I'll say what I want.

27:07.200 --> 27:10.317
- Stop shouting.
- You can't give me orders.

27:10.520 --> 27:12.795
You can go to hell!

29:36.760 --> 29:38.637
There you are.

29:38.840 --> 29:42.515
- What are you doing?
- I am praying for Johan.

30:04.760 --> 30:07.274
You're praying for yourself.

30:07.480 --> 30:11.712
Go away. Leave me alone.

30:11.920 --> 30:16.198
Goddamn lousy acting.
Goddamn acting.

33:03.800 --> 33:07.110
<i>I cannot.</i>
<i>I will not live with you anymore...</i>

33:07.320 --> 33:13.236
<i>I do not believe in new attempts</i>
<i>as neither of us wants to change.</i>

33:13.440 --> 33:16.034
<i>But I won't give in.</i>

33:16.240 --> 33:20.119
<i>Because that will lead</i>
<i>to new complications...</i>

33:20.320 --> 33:24.108
<i>... which in their turn will lead to -</i>

33:24.320 --> 33:28.871
<i>- new acts of physical and</i>
<i>psychological violence.</i>

34:33.360 --> 34:35.793
I don't understand.

34:38.600 --> 34:42.513
I just don't understand.
I can not figure you out.

34:42.719 --> 34:46.190
I am afraid all the time.

34:46.400 --> 34:51.428
Do you think I want to stay here
and perhaps be killed?

34:51.639 --> 34:55.599
Do you think I like to watch
you running after that woman, -

34:55.800 --> 35:01.238
- talking to your ridiculous ghosts
having to guard myself the whole time?

35:02.680 --> 35:04.910
But I'm still here.

36:05.120 --> 36:07.998
Jan...

36:14.000 --> 36:18.551
What is it going to be like if we
can't talk to each other again?

36:18.760 --> 36:21.433
The boat is here.

40:26.280 --> 40:29.875
I have to leave to avoid traffic.

40:31.080 --> 40:35.870
- Goodbye, Marianne. Take care.
- Goodbye.

40:37.040 --> 40:42.114
- I might be back in a week.
- If only you were here.

40:44.920 --> 40:47.388
We'd make a fresh start.

40:48.240 --> 40:52.438
We'd throw out our stale old routines.

40:52.640 --> 40:56.030
We'd talk about the past.

40:56.240 --> 40:58.629
Figure out where we went wrong.

40:58.840 --> 41:03.675
You'd hear no accusations from me.

41:03.880 --> 41:05.632
Johan...

41:05.840 --> 41:10.516
This all seems so unreal.
I don't know what to do.

41:12.440 --> 41:15.557
You're shutting me out.

41:15.760 --> 41:19.036
Any solution
would be better than this.

41:19.240 --> 41:24.075
Could you promise to come back?
That would tide me over.

41:24.280 --> 41:27.955
Then you wouldn't be leaving me
without hope.

41:28.160 --> 41:31.596
Even if you have no intention
of returning, you could say you do.

41:31.800 --> 41:35.236
I have to go now.

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:48.879
I know what I feel.

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:54.279
I love you in my selfish way...

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:59.998
...and I think you love me
in your fussy, pestering way.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:06.275
We love each other
in an earthly and imperfect way.

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:08.914
But you are so demanding.

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:11.509
Yes, I am.

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:14.029
It is as simple as this.

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:19.360
Here I am in a dark house
somewhere in the world, -

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:22.870
- with my arms around you.

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:26.834
And you are here in my embrace.

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:32.034
- I am not the most compassionate man...
- No, you're not.

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:36.279
- I am low on imagination, I suppose.
- No, you're rather unimaginative.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:41.110
I don't know what love looks like,
and I can't describe it.

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:44.676
Most of the time I can't feel it.

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:48.839
You really think I love you too?

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.917
Yes, I do.

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:54.954
But if we harp on it,
it will vanish...

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.912
Damn you, Johan.

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.754
Damn you old idiot.

01:09:44.319 --> 01:09:48.518
But after all these years...
Why did you come?

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:52.759
- I thought you called me.
- I never called anyone.

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:55.633
I had it in my head.

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:57.876
How strange.

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:02.477
I understand you're not understanding.

01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:04.671
How long will you stay?

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:08.031
I have a case on the 27th.

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:10.117
November?

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.151
October.

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:17.597
Good night again.

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.791
Good night.

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.079
Quiet please!

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:56.838
Rolling!

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.519
Camera!

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:04.668
Take!

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:04.679
