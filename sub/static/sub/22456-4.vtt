00:05.949 --> 00:08.943
<i>...And I'm so hot</i>

00:08.991 --> 00:13.511

00:18.278 --> 00:21.511
'Yeah, fuck you.

00:21.560 --> 00:24.634
'Shit. Five hours on Blitzkreig.

00:24.682 --> 00:29.600
'This isn't how it was meant to be.
Week's holiday?

00:29.645 --> 00:31.285
'I was gonna get to grips with
the Roman Republic.

00:31.327 --> 00:33.478
'Get into the GI diet.

00:33.528 --> 00:37.000
'Can't stop now - gotta
win the war for the Nazis.

00:37.050 --> 00:38.565
'Am I enjoying this?

00:38.612 --> 00:41.366
'Don't know any more.
Doesn't matter.

00:41.413 --> 00:43.133
'Gotta finish the level.

00:43.175 --> 00:46.533
'Then read those, do some sit-ups,
learn the clarinet.'

00:46.577 --> 00:48.170
OK, bye.

00:48.218 --> 00:50.575
That was your sister.
She'll be here in an hour.

00:50.620 --> 00:51.815
My sister?

00:51.861 --> 00:55.219
Yes, your sister. She's coming to
stay, remember. I left you a message.

00:55.263 --> 00:57.220
Do you mean the pizza coupon

00:57.264 --> 01:00.463
with "sis mesg?" written
with a burnt match?

01:00.506 --> 01:02.146
Yeah, she rang
a couple of nights ago.

01:02.188 --> 01:03.781
She's broken up with her husband.

01:03.829 --> 01:05.582
What! Hold on.

01:05.630 --> 01:09.785
Sarah's broken up with Simon?
That's terrible.

01:09.833 --> 01:13.430
'Never get
my iPod speakers back now.

01:13.475 --> 01:17.471
'Still, on the bright side, the
base response was pretty awful.'

01:18.959 --> 01:22.078
So, Sarah, great to see you.

01:22.121 --> 01:23.919
We haven't had a proper chat in ages.

01:23.962 --> 01:25.795
I've been chomping at the bit.

01:25.844 --> 01:28.120
All this crap with Simon's
brought up so much stuff for me.

01:28.165 --> 01:29.599
Really.

01:29.646 --> 01:31.684
You seen they have
jumbo cashews now?

01:31.728 --> 01:33.720
Yeah, I think we're
overdue for a big chat, aren't we?

01:33.769 --> 01:35.567
Spill some home truths?

01:35.610 --> 01:38.206
Yeah. Course, I was happy enough

01:38.252 --> 01:40.244
with the normal size.
But nothing lasts.

01:40.293 --> 01:43.128
All the shit that went on at
Grange Terrace before the move,

01:43.175 --> 01:45.327
get it all out,
cos it's so hard when

01:45.377 --> 01:47.812
you're trying to work through this
family stuff on your own, isn't it?

01:47.858 --> 01:51.171
'Why do the people who want to
talk about things always win?

01:51.221 --> 01:53.976
'Why can't the people who don't
want to talk about things win? '

01:54.023 --> 01:56.254
It's great getting everything
out in the open.

01:56.304 --> 01:59.059
I think so, but a lot of
men don't see it that way.

01:59.106 --> 02:01.622
They're just not comfortable
talking about emotions.

02:01.668 --> 02:04.468
I think it's different
when you're a musician.

02:04.510 --> 02:05.864
You're a musician?

02:05.911 --> 02:08.905
Yeah, I'm a musician.
I really think that music

02:08.953 --> 02:11.149
really opens you up emotionally.

02:11.194 --> 02:13.630
A lot of musicians
like me feel that way.

02:13.676 --> 02:14.951
I think that's great.

02:14.997 --> 02:16.954
'Oh, my God, he's doing it.

02:16.998 --> 02:19.912
'His routine. He's doing
his routine on my sister! '

02:19.960 --> 02:22.112
Yeah. Mark's not too musical.

02:22.162 --> 02:25.361
He bought a clarinet but
he uses it to hit a cymbal.

02:25.404 --> 02:27.521
'She's laughing.

02:27.565 --> 02:30.924
'She's laughing at his jokes! '
Yes, great, Jeremy, getting

02:30.968 --> 02:33.723
everything out in the open.
Have you told Sarah

02:33.770 --> 02:36.923
how you've got chlamydia and
you're still in love with Big Suze?

02:36.972 --> 02:39.407
It was a visa marriage,
it's symptomless

02:39.453 --> 02:43.244
and it's a platonic love, as you
might have for a dog or a sandwich.

02:43.296 --> 02:45.766
Be back in two ticks.

02:51.221 --> 02:53.817
I see you. I know what you're doing.

02:53.863 --> 02:56.095
- What?
- You're gonna try and sleep with her.

02:56.145 --> 02:58.376
I can see it in your eyes.

02:58.426 --> 03:01.660
Look, Mark, she's your sister.

03:01.709 --> 03:03.621
I know that. Yeah?

03:03.670 --> 03:06.823
Promise me you'll not
try to sleep with her.

03:06.872 --> 03:09.547
I promise I will try
not to sleep with her.

03:14.117 --> 03:17.634
So, you slept with her.

03:17.679 --> 03:18.908
You promised!

03:18.960 --> 03:20.599
I promised to try not to.

03:20.641 --> 03:22.554
Yeah, well you didn't
try very hard, did you!

03:22.603 --> 03:24.276
Mark, I tried incredibly hard.

03:24.324 --> 03:26.600
It just turns out it was
impossible not to.

03:26.645 --> 03:27.795
Morning, Mark. >

03:27.846 --> 03:30.521
Hey, honey, I called
Frank about the clerking job.

03:30.568 --> 03:33.403
Should be fine for you to fill-in.
Come in 10ish.

03:33.450 --> 03:36.171
Cool, thanks.

03:36.212 --> 03:40.891
'They're rubbing it in. It's like
I've got his member in my face.'

03:40.935 --> 03:44.692
Easy money. Turns out getting a job
doesn't involve spending hours

03:44.738 --> 03:48.528
making sure every single word
on your CV's spelt right, hey, Mark.

03:48.580 --> 03:51.176
Nothing means
anything to you, does it?

03:51.222 --> 03:53.340
Friendship, loyalty - they're just

03:53.384 --> 03:58.177
fusty old words, like sixpence
and codpiece, to you, aren't they?

03:58.227 --> 04:02.223
Oh, Mark.
Mate, it isn't like that at all.

04:02.270 --> 04:04.262
She's in a vulnerable state, Jeremy.

04:04.311 --> 04:05.825
She's not a refugee, Mark.

04:05.872 --> 04:07.829
She's a 29-year-old solicitor.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.547
With a great arse.

04:09.595 --> 04:11.427
Don't say that!

04:11.476 --> 04:16.757
I know what you do with the
electric toothbrush

04:16.798 --> 04:20.636
and the bum stuff. God, I can't
believe I'm even thinking about it.

04:20.682 --> 04:23.915
Couldn't you find anyone
else to shag?

04:23.964 --> 04:25.717
Mark, mate, look,

04:25.766 --> 04:27.405
this wasn't just a shag.

04:27.447 --> 04:31.567
As soon as I met her,
I had these strong,

04:31.609 --> 04:33.681
almost uncontrollable feelings.

04:33.731 --> 04:37.487
You'll say anything. Words don't
mean a thing to you, do they?

04:37.533 --> 04:39.605
I think I love her.

04:39.655 --> 04:41.487
I think I've fallen in love with her.

04:41.536 --> 04:44.006
You can't blame me for falling
in love with her, can you?

04:44.058 --> 04:45.731
No, I guess not.

04:46.780 --> 04:49.580
It's just, I don't believe you.

04:49.622 --> 04:52.696
Oh, right. There's not much I can
really do about that, is there?

04:52.744 --> 04:56.136
Unless you want me to buy her
the biggest puppy

04:56.186 --> 04:58.463
or heart-shaped cushion in the world?

04:58.508 --> 05:00.340
Is that literally
what you want me to do? >

05:00.389 --> 05:03.861
Buy her a puppy the size of
Digby, the biggest dog in the world.

05:06.753 --> 05:10.031
'lf I don't pay it's OK.
If I don't pay it's OK.

05:10.076 --> 05:14.390
'Oh, God. Four hours of my
precious holiday wasted.

05:14.438 --> 05:16.954
'The day's a write-off.
Might as well just carry on.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.439
'Must be something to puncture
my thickening shield of numbness.

05:21.483 --> 05:23.441
Just a minute.

'There's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

05:25.646 --> 05:28.401
'Looking at porn is just
like lying to Parliament.

'It used to be wrong but now
it's just a great big funny joke.'

05:32.931 --> 05:34.445
Big Suze.

05:34.492 --> 05:38.807
Hi, Mark. I was after Jez. I need
someone to run my lines with. Is he?

05:38.855 --> 05:43.329
No, Jez, he's not here.
He's with my sister.

05:43.378 --> 05:46.099
They've started going out, actually.

05:46.140 --> 05:48.132
Oh, God, wow.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.935
He's moving on.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.656
What are the lines?

05:51.704 --> 05:55.494
Oh, I just got a part in the
stage version of the movie Crash.

05:55.546 --> 05:58.016
You know, the one about
people who feel sexy

05:58.068 --> 06:00.789
when they think about
road traffic accidents.

06:00.830 --> 06:02.059
'God she's beautiful.

06:02.111 --> 06:03.830
'How did Jeremy ever...

06:03.872 --> 06:06.593
'I guess she's just a bit stupid.'

06:06.634 --> 06:09.309
Not interrupting, am I?
What were you up to?

06:09.356 --> 06:12.714
Oh, no, just a
bit of internet research.

06:12.758 --> 06:15.149
Right. "Looking at nudie
ladies" research. >

06:15.200 --> 06:19.081
'My God, she's not stupid,
she's incredibly perceptive.'

06:19.122 --> 06:21.558
Don't worry, I won't tell Sophie.

06:21.604 --> 06:24.723
God, no, nothing like that. I wish.

06:24.766 --> 06:26.678
No, historical.

06:26.727 --> 06:28.606
Sophie wouldn't want
to know about history.

06:28.649 --> 06:30.880
I'll actually turn that off.

06:30.930 --> 06:33.924
I was just heading out -
salad and a Hawksmoor church.

06:33.972 --> 06:35.486
Hawksmoor, my God, I think

06:35.533 --> 06:38.687
my mum's related to a Hawksmoor,
about a million times removed.

06:38.736 --> 06:41.251
'God, she's so posh that I,

06:41.297 --> 06:43.290
'Mark Corrigan,

Listen, if you want...

06:50.143 --> 06:52.898
You probably don't want to...
You'd be very welcome to...

06:52.945 --> 06:55.177
I'd love to.

06:58.029 --> 07:01.307
That really was a great
church, wasn't it? So beautiful.

07:01.351 --> 07:03.263
I know.
They're probably just waiting

07:03.312 --> 07:05.191
for the last few Christians
to die out

07:05.234 --> 07:07.908
and then they'll convert it
it into a prestige living space.

07:07.955 --> 07:11.837
'Oh, God, she's so incredibly
lovely. She's probably got a title.

07:11.878 --> 07:14.474

'Lady Big Suze and Lord Mark.

'No, don't get ahead of yourself.

'Just focus on trying to lean her
towards ecclesiastical architecture

'and away from disco dancing.'

07:26.568 --> 07:27.968
Come on, keep up.

07:28.009 --> 07:30.479
But watch out, though,
I'm on your tail.

07:30.531 --> 07:33.000
I'm Hawksmoor, you're Wren.

07:33.052 --> 07:36.764
'Oh, my God,
I've fallen in love with her.

07:36.815 --> 07:40.366
'Of course. Brilliant.
How incredibly predictable.

I'd rather it was him.'

08:01.712 --> 08:03.271
You're looking well.

08:03.313 --> 08:08.265
Thanks. And you're back from work.

08:08.316 --> 08:09.545
How is work?

08:09.597 --> 08:12.159
How's work? How's work, he says.

08:12.199 --> 08:15.079
You've seen the
Killing Fields, right.

08:15.121 --> 08:16.350
What's Big Suze doing here?

08:16.402 --> 08:19.635
Oh, she's just
e- mailing her agent about the play.

08:21.245 --> 08:24.000
That is ticketyboo.

08:24.047 --> 08:25.242
She said you two had been out.

08:25.288 --> 08:27.963
Oh, yeah, we just popped
to the British Museum

08:28.010 --> 08:31.561
and then to the lmax to watch
a 3D film about the Rolling Stones.

08:31.612 --> 08:34.253
Block of fudge?

08:34.294 --> 08:38.131
What's going on? Do you fancy her?
Are you in love with her?

08:38.177 --> 08:39.496
What!

08:39.537 --> 08:42.178
My God, Jeremy, of course not. No.

08:42.219 --> 08:44.894
Yeah, well you'd better not be.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.332
Thanks for telling Sarah
that I'm in love with her.

08:47.383 --> 08:50.934
Normally when people are in love
and sharing a bed,

08:50.985 --> 08:54.583
contrary to all prior arrangements,
they like to shout about it.

08:54.628 --> 08:56.506
Look, I'm in love with her,
all right.

08:56.549 --> 09:00.545
It's just,
she wants to talk about it a lot,

09:00.592 --> 09:04.668
which I'm fine with, but
while I'm eating a jacket potato?

09:04.715 --> 09:06.832
'Potato - perfect.'

09:06.876 --> 09:09.597
Mark, I'm sorry, but I
think I might have deleted >

09:09.638 --> 09:11.231
your e-mail address book. >

09:11.279 --> 09:13.077
Oh, that's fine, don't worry.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.679
You are in love with her!

09:14.721 --> 09:16.075
What? No, I'm not.

09:16.122 --> 09:18.354
Yes, you bloody are.
You practically crucified me

09:18.404 --> 09:20.123
the day I changed your home page.

09:20.165 --> 09:23.443
No, it's just, I have a paper copy.

09:23.487 --> 09:25.001
I know you, Corrigan.

09:25.048 --> 09:29.887
How dare you! You've got no
business being in love with Big Suze.

09:29.932 --> 09:31.889
Jeremy, I'm not in love with her.

09:31.933 --> 09:34.654
Anyway, how come you
even care about Suze

09:34.695 --> 09:36.448
if you're so in love with my sister!

09:36.496 --> 09:39.251
I don't care. I'm just interested.

09:39.298 --> 09:41.973
You seem pretty angry for
someone who's just interested.

09:42.020 --> 09:46.221
Well, being interested
sometimes makes people angry, Mark.

09:46.263 --> 09:48.539
I thought that was common knowledge.

09:50.105 --> 09:52.780
'Oh, yes, the healthy life.

09:52.827 --> 09:55.263
'Haven't surfed for filth for days.

09:55.309 --> 09:57.266
'And I've almost
forgotten the images

09:57.310 --> 10:00.429
'that are seared into
my brain for ever.'

10:00.472 --> 10:02.669
Sorry. Not getting much sleep.

10:02.714 --> 10:04.831
They found asbestos in
my airing cupboard

10:04.875 --> 10:06.868
so I'm on a
camp bed in the hall.

10:06.917 --> 10:11.277
Well, if it all gets too much,
you can always crash at my place.

10:11.320 --> 10:12.913
Thank you.

10:12.961 --> 10:14.759
So, ready?

10:14.802 --> 10:16.919
'I'm ready.
Ready to watch your lovely bottom

10:16.964 --> 10:18.796
'before I have a heart attack.

10:18.845 --> 10:23.239
'Hey, wow, I'm actually good
at this. Maybe I'm a natural.

10:23.288 --> 10:26.760
'Yeah, I'm a jogger. Of course,
there had to be a sport for me.

10:26.810 --> 10:29.246
'I just never realised.
I'm a natural jogger.

10:29.292 --> 10:35.610
'Feel the legs like two great
steam locomotives pumping away.

10:35.656 --> 10:38.092
'I'm Cram I'm Ovett,
I'm unstoppable...

10:38.138 --> 10:39.857
'Jesus, is that a stitch.

10:39.899 --> 10:41.777
'Fuck, I think I'm gonna be sick.

10:41.820 --> 10:43.493
'Slow. I need to walk.

10:43.542 --> 10:46.011
'Oh, I think I'm gonna puke.

10:46.063 --> 10:47.782
'I'm literally gonna die.

10:47.824 --> 10:51.422
'What an idiotic boob I was
about 10 or 11 seconds ago.'

10:54.109 --> 10:55.509
This is so kind of you, Mark.

10:55.550 --> 10:58.065
I wasn't getting a wink on the camp bed.
But if Soph's coming over,

10:58.111 --> 11:01.185
or I'm cramping
your style, you must let me know.

11:01.234 --> 11:02.587
Oh, no, it's fine.

11:02.634 --> 11:06.789
I don't have a style really,
so no cramping. 'Don't get excited.

11:06.837 --> 11:11.152
'Just lie on the floor at her feet
like the faithful dog I am.

11:11.200 --> 11:13.113
'I will protect you, Big Suze.

11:13.162 --> 11:16.520
'lf any intruders come,
I will attack. I'll bite.'

11:16.564 --> 11:18.760
Mark, it's crazy
you being down on the floor

11:18.805 --> 11:23.405
when there's loads of room
in the bed. Hop on in.

11:23.449 --> 11:25.247
I don't think...

11:25.290 --> 11:26.519
Really?

11:26.571 --> 11:30.852
Relax, Mark. I promise I won't steal
your half of the duvet or anything.

11:32.415 --> 11:34.327
Great.

11:34.376 --> 11:38.736
Do you know what you are, Mark?
A big cuddly grouch ball.

11:38.779 --> 11:42.137
It's like sharing a bed with
Fozzy Bear or Oscar the Grouch.

11:42.181 --> 11:43.900
'Maybe something could happen.

11:43.942 --> 11:48.497
'In the same bed,
human nature might take its course.'

11:48.546 --> 11:51.061
Kind of like a
modern-day eunuch, aren't you, Mark?

11:52.628 --> 11:54.780
Yes, I suppose so.

11:54.830 --> 11:57.426
'I know what I'll do.
I'll wait till she's asleep

11:57.472 --> 11:59.623
'and then touch her hair.

11:59.673 --> 12:02.712
'Just as much hair
touching as I like.'

12:05.877 --> 12:08.313
'How can Mark be in
love with Big Suze?

12:08.359 --> 12:12.594
'It's like Swaziland trying to invade
China. It's a bloody political joke.

12:12.642 --> 12:16.034
'Yeah, well, while your failing to
get anywhere at all with my ex, Mark,

12:16.084 --> 12:20.319
'I'm doing the nasty with
your very own sister.

12:20.367 --> 12:22.199
'Not really in the moment though.

12:22.248 --> 12:26.164
'What's wrong?
Got my sex mix on. Is it?

12:26.211 --> 12:28.932
'She can't! Does she?

12:28.973 --> 12:31.330
'God, she does, she smells like Mark.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.606
'She must use the same talcum power.

12:33.656 --> 12:35.329
'Who still uses talcum power?

12:35.377 --> 12:37.847
'Bollocks, got to get into this.'

12:37.899 --> 12:39.652
You know, if you want,

12:39.700 --> 12:42.774
you could slip a finger up my arse?

12:42.822 --> 12:45.463
- What?
- Up my bum, up my bottom.

12:45.504 --> 12:48.145
Why on earth would I want to
do anything to your bottom?

12:48.186 --> 12:51.703
No, sure. Sorry.

12:57.953 --> 13:01.868
Now that's... ticketyboo.

13:01.915 --> 13:04.954
'Oh, my God! That's...

13:04.997 --> 13:10.758
'She's Mark! I've basically
got my penis inside Mark.'

13:13.443 --> 13:16.995
So are you really gonna do this?
You, me, big Suze, Sarah?

13:18.206 --> 13:19.640
You're such a bastard.

13:19.687 --> 13:23.160
Steady on.
My mushroom stroganoff isn't that bad.

13:23.210 --> 13:27.843
OK, I know you're going to say
no to this, but I said I'd ask.

13:27.893 --> 13:30.693
Sarah's looking for a place to stay.

13:30.735 --> 13:33.729
I said because it's a small flat

13:33.777 --> 13:35.769
and there'd be bathroom issues, so...

13:35.818 --> 13:37.936
I'm sure we can work it out.

13:37.980 --> 13:40.974
Shame to break up the lovebirds.

13:41.022 --> 13:44.380
Unless... you do want her to stay,
don't you?

13:44.424 --> 13:46.860
Well, of course.

13:46.906 --> 13:49.581
Obviously. That's obvious.

13:49.628 --> 13:51.426
I'd be very happy.

13:51.469 --> 13:55.225
Then you're going to have to take
responsibility for your actions.

13:55.271 --> 13:56.500
For once.

13:56.552 --> 14:00.753
'Why should I take responsibility
for my actions?

14:00.795 --> 14:05.553
'I don't spend hours thinking about
them. What kind of life is that? '

14:05.598 --> 14:10.153
- How was he?
- Oh, sounds like it should be fine.

14:10.202 --> 14:12.512
See, I told you.

14:12.563 --> 14:15.204
Now, I've got all your files out.

14:15.245 --> 14:20.038
I've got a feeling your National
Insurance affairs aren't in order.

14:20.088 --> 14:22.843
'There's a Mark in here and a Mark in there.
I'm surrounded.'

14:25.452 --> 14:29.528
Thought Sarah was going to join us?
Mark says you're in love.

14:29.575 --> 14:32.090
She must be amazing.

14:32.136 --> 14:35.529
Um, yeah. She's great.
She's on the phone.

14:35.579 --> 14:38.857
That's nice.
That's a nice thing to say.

14:38.901 --> 14:45.014
So, what is it especially that you,
you know, love about her?

14:45.065 --> 14:47.342
Oh, I couldn't possibly...

14:47.387 --> 14:51.268
Oh, come on. Is she the one?
Do you think it will last?

14:51.309 --> 14:55.351
No. I mean, I hope it does,
but nothing does,

14:55.392 --> 14:57.589
so I'm just being realistic.

14:57.634 --> 15:02.586
He's bashful, but I see
brother-in-law material there.

15:02.637 --> 15:07.509
So, Suze, how's everything
with your bloke, what's-his-name?

15:07.560 --> 15:10.953
We finished, so no need
to twist the knife.

15:11.003 --> 15:13.724
Oh, sorry, I had no idea.

15:13.765 --> 15:17.077
I'm here for you.

15:17.127 --> 15:20.804
Jeremy, I think
your girlfriend's crying.

15:20.849 --> 15:22.044
Your sister.

15:22.090 --> 15:25.529
That was definitely sobbing, Jez.

15:25.573 --> 15:29.204
But she was taking a call
from your dad, so maybe

15:29.255 --> 15:31.452
if it's family stuff, you should...

15:31.497 --> 15:36.858
Well, even if it is family stuff,
I don't want to know about

15:36.900 --> 15:39.735
all the infidelities and heartache,

15:39.782 --> 15:42.821
and if Uncle Lance was touched up by
the vicar,

15:42.864 --> 15:47.224
and that's why he's such a tit
at Christmas, I'm sorry.

15:47.267 --> 15:49.180
She does sound upset.

15:49.229 --> 15:52.826
All right, fine, I'll talk to her.

15:52.871 --> 15:56.549
It'll be good to hear
about... everything.

15:56.594 --> 15:59.633
'While she's talking, I'll use
my mind to think about other things.'

15:59.676 --> 16:02.636
You OK, lovebumps?

16:04.279 --> 16:06.510
Do you want to talk about it?

16:06.560 --> 16:08.917
Jez, listen.

16:08.962 --> 16:12.560
'This is an hour of my life
I'll never get back.

16:12.605 --> 16:15.758
'While Mark and Big Suze
do lovely chatting,

16:15.807 --> 16:18.163
'I get put through
the emotional mincing machine'.

16:18.208 --> 16:22.284
That was Simon.
We're going to... we talked,

16:22.331 --> 16:25.689
and we're going to give it
another chance.

16:25.733 --> 16:26.689
You are.

16:26.734 --> 16:31.049
'Simon, you are a god! ' Oh, wow.

16:31.097 --> 16:34.057
I'm so sorry, honey bear.

16:34.099 --> 16:35.613
Sarah, ssh.

16:35.660 --> 16:38.734
Que sera, sera.

16:38.782 --> 16:43.735
I've got to go. We're meeting at
Cafe Rouge for a summit and a steak.

16:43.786 --> 16:45.140
Adios, amigo.

16:45.187 --> 16:47.987
'Oh, my God,
she's actually going.

16:48.029 --> 16:54.745
'She's going. Freedom in
five, four, three, two, one! '

16:54.793 --> 16:57.263
'Ole, ole, ole, ole! '

16:57.315 --> 17:00.354
What are you dancing a jig for,
Jeremy?

17:00.397 --> 17:06.396
I just heard that Jamiroquai are playing
Reading. I fucking love those guys!

17:06.441 --> 17:08.478
Where's Sarah gone?

17:08.521 --> 17:10.276
She's off to meet Simon.

17:10.324 --> 17:13.318
They're getting back together.

17:13.366 --> 17:17.077
This has worked out perfectly
for you, hasn't it?

17:17.127 --> 17:18.561
No, not at all.

17:18.608 --> 17:21.968
Come on, this is me
you're talking to.

17:22.012 --> 17:27.089
Maybe it's time you stopped pretending
not to be in love with big Suze.

17:27.135 --> 17:28.728
What are you?

17:30.337 --> 17:34.697
Look, all right. The fact is,
she is a beautiful woman.

17:34.740 --> 17:36.618
That's just a fact.

17:36.661 --> 17:38.779
A blind man could see that.

17:38.823 --> 17:41.942
But I'm not gonna do anything.

17:41.985 --> 17:47.507
I'm just like a kind of blind
eunuch, looking at a painting.

17:47.549 --> 17:49.302
Fair enough.

17:49.350 --> 17:53.187
'My carefully nurtured public image
succeeds once again'.

17:53.233 --> 17:54.952
Let's crack open the gin.

17:56.635 --> 17:58.274
'Brilliant.

17:58.316 --> 18:02.517
'Total lack of self-control.
Drunk himself out of contention'.

18:02.559 --> 18:05.917
He was really guzzling, wasn't he?
Is he OK?

18:05.961 --> 18:08.716
Just very upset about Sarah.

18:08.763 --> 18:11.723
I think they really had a bond.

18:11.765 --> 18:14.804
Oh, right.

18:14.847 --> 18:17.886
Suze, are you OK?

18:17.929 --> 18:22.289
I don't know. It's just... my
sister's just come off a moped

18:22.332 --> 18:27.285
in Zakynthos, and she might have to
have a pin in her leg.

18:27.336 --> 18:32.413
And she flew budget, so it'll be
a nightmare coming through security.

18:32.459 --> 18:35.578
The only airline that
really understands is BA.

18:35.621 --> 18:40.095
Oh, yeah. I know.
They're great, aren't they?

18:42.186 --> 18:45.817
'Here we go. My God, I'm gonna
have to learn to ride a horse'.

18:45.868 --> 18:51.663
This looks like a very sweet scene.
What exactly is going on here?

18:51.712 --> 18:54.433
I was just telling Mark about Tor.

18:54.474 --> 18:57.036
- You realise what he's doing?
- Jez.

18:57.076 --> 19:02.313
He bloody loves you. It's pathetic.
I I bet you've got a hard-on.

19:02.360 --> 19:06.116
No, of course I haven't.
She was telling me...

19:06.162 --> 19:07.881
Take your trousers off.

19:07.923 --> 19:09.118
Don't be ridiculous.

19:09.164 --> 19:12.556
You've got nothing to hide, have you?
Come on, let's have a look.

19:12.607 --> 19:14.439
No! It's hard, isn't it?

19:14.488 --> 19:18.882
No. And even if it was, it wouldn't
prove love. It's just a human body!

19:18.931 --> 19:23.405
Suddenly you're admitting
to having a human body.

19:23.454 --> 19:25.013
You're no bloody eunuch!

19:26.496 --> 19:30.207
I'm going to answer the door now,
Mark, but I'm coming back for you.

19:30.258 --> 19:33.378
And your cock.

19:34.341 --> 19:37.619
- He was lying all along, the arsehole.
- What?

19:37.664 --> 19:42.502
I looked at his phone, there were
texts, all hugs and bloody kisses!

19:42.547 --> 19:45.985
'She's back!
This is a fucking nightmare! '

19:46.029 --> 19:50.662
You don't, do you,
have feelings for me, Mark?

19:50.712 --> 19:53.865
'This is it. Go for it. Tell her.

19:53.915 --> 19:56.714
'Betray Sophie, destroy Jeremy.'

19:56.756 --> 19:58.110
No.

19:58.157 --> 20:00.798
God, no.

20:00.839 --> 20:03.992
As you know,
I'm in love with Sophie.

20:04.041 --> 20:06.238
Right. I thought...

20:06.283 --> 20:10.757
Honestly, Suze, I like you,

20:10.806 --> 20:14.722
sort of, but not even
really that much.

20:14.769 --> 20:19.926
I mean, you're very,
you know... horsey.

20:19.972 --> 20:24.253
You're the horsey type. Not that
I've got a chip on my shoulder.

20:24.295 --> 20:30.488
You're sort of a throwback,
a kind of Marie Antoinette figure.

20:30.539 --> 20:35.138
Let them eat cake. It's a
mistranslation, but... you know.

20:35.663 --> 20:41.024
Big, stupid,
posh head, that's you.

20:42.868 --> 20:47.820
'She's like one of those
big turds that just won't flush'.

20:47.871 --> 20:50.512
If you want, I could call you a cab.

20:50.553 --> 20:53.547
It's good to be back where I'm safe.

20:53.595 --> 20:55.791
We have got so much to talk about.

20:55.836 --> 20:58.796
Oh, right, yes, of course.

20:58.839 --> 21:01.718
I'm just gonna clean up, OK?

21:01.760 --> 21:03.957
'Oh, please, Simon, take her back! '

21:05.683 --> 21:10.157
Jez, listen. I need a drink.
Do you fancy a drink?

21:10.967 --> 21:16.488
Er, I can't, really, because... yes.

21:16.531 --> 21:18.568
Hold on. Give me five.

21:18.612 --> 21:20.251
See you in the pub.

21:23.295 --> 21:25.287
Well, happy now?

21:25.336 --> 21:27.374
I'm going to the pub with Big Suze.

21:27.418 --> 21:30.378
Tell Sarah I've finished with her.

21:30.420 --> 21:32.651
Absolutely not!

21:32.701 --> 21:35.776
You've got to face up
to your responsibilities!

21:35.824 --> 21:38.293
Be nice about it, cos I do love her.

21:38.345 --> 21:41.818
I've got commitment issues, yeah?

21:41.868 --> 21:43.188
Jeremy!

21:43.229 --> 21:45.664
Mark, what's...

21:45.710 --> 21:46.905
Where's Jez?

21:46.951 --> 21:51.983
Oh, Sarah, I... Blimey.

21:52.035 --> 21:57.875
Look, thing is... It's really not my
responsibility to tell you this...

21:57.919 --> 22:00.036
Jeremy's gone, OK?

22:00.080 --> 22:03.677
He's pissed off. He's left.
I'm not gonna do his dirty work.

22:03.722 --> 22:05.521
Dirty work?

22:05.564 --> 22:09.879
The dickhead, he wanted me to dump
you for him, if you can imagine.

22:09.927 --> 22:11.839
He's dumping me?

22:11.888 --> 22:13.845
'I should be honest.

22:13.889 --> 22:18.842
'Just tell her he fucked her,
and now he's chucked her.'

22:18.893 --> 22:22.490
Look, it's not you, it's him.
He has commitment issues.

22:22.535 --> 22:25.097
- You're loving this.
- No.

22:25.137 --> 22:28.256
You never wanted us to be together.

22:28.299 --> 22:31.817
You're very controlling,
and you need to talk about that.

22:31.862 --> 22:33.774
I really don't.

If you stopped talking for a minute,

22:36.825 --> 22:41.856
maybe Jeremy and Simon
wouldn't keep on dumping you.

22:41.908 --> 22:43.821
Brilliant.

22:43.870 --> 22:48.628
Thanks. Thank you very much, Mark.
See you later.

22:48.673 --> 22:52.715
'Great, so I've dumped my sister.

22:52.756 --> 22:56.671
'I'm intrigued to see
what I'm gonna do next.

22:56.718 --> 23:01.033
'Maybe I'll ring up Grandad
and tell him he's a boring twat.'

23:08.927 --> 23:13.560
<i>Paranoia, paranoia
Everybody's coming to get me</i>

23:13.610 --> 23:16.843
<i>Just say you never met me</i>

23:16.892 --> 23:20.250
<i>I'm running underground
with the moles</i>

23:20.294 --> 23:21.887
<i>Digging in holes...</i>
