00:06.950 --> 00:08.480
♪ I'll always have these

00:08.580 --> 00:11.580
silent lunches to look back on.

00:11.650 --> 00:15.300
So, before I go over and
help Aunt Jackie and Becky

00:15.320 --> 00:17.690
with the baby shower, um...

00:17.810 --> 00:19.660
I'll just do that.

00:19.690 --> 00:23.300
I wanted to tell you guys that, um,

00:23.320 --> 00:24.629
I've been seeing someone.

00:24.630 --> 00:26.160
Yeah, we already figured that out

00:26.230 --> 00:28.750
because of all the recent
neglect and everything.

00:29.840 --> 00:31.220
Oh, yeah, that's my bad.

00:31.300 --> 00:34.210
I've always tried to maintain
a steady level of neglect.

00:35.270 --> 00:37.900
But I haven't brought
anybody home until now

00:37.920 --> 00:40.010
because I didn't want you to meet anyone

00:40.070 --> 00:41.410
unless it was serious.

00:41.450 --> 00:43.580
Oh, so there were other guys

00:43.620 --> 00:44.970
that you weren't serious about

00:45.050 --> 00:48.250
that you were sleeping
with and we didn't know?

00:49.390 --> 00:51.590
No, besides Ben,

00:51.660 --> 00:54.060
I am proud to say that I
haven't slept with anyone

00:54.090 --> 00:56.430
except your dad and one other man.

00:56.530 --> 00:57.530
What about Neil?

00:57.600 --> 01:00.100
Oh, and one more, yeah.

01:00.130 --> 01:01.730
Um... wait, how did you know about Neil?

01:01.830 --> 01:03.720
He's called a couple
times on the landline

01:03.740 --> 01:05.840
crying about how you broke up with him.

01:05.910 --> 01:08.610
I told him you were nothing
special and he should move on.

01:08.670 --> 01:11.840
Oh. Hurtful, but helpful.

01:11.910 --> 01:17.080
Um, so Ben is coming to
dinner tomorrow night,

01:17.120 --> 01:19.080
and I just want you guys to be cool.

01:19.140 --> 01:21.620
Ben will never be my daddy. Never.

01:23.840 --> 01:25.790
Is all the sex worth this?

01:27.560 --> 01:28.890
- Psych!
- Ha!

01:28.960 --> 01:30.510
Nice.

01:30.630 --> 01:33.000
Uh... there's enough money for
one of you to go to college.

01:33.070 --> 01:34.380
Fight it out.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.350
It's about time you came over.

01:37.440 --> 01:39.580
Jackie wants a DJ for the baby shower,

01:39.610 --> 01:41.090
and I think I should have a live band.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.140
What do you think?

01:42.170 --> 01:44.490
I think my baby shower

01:44.520 --> 01:46.800
was a cake and a card that
said "Get Well Soon,"

01:46.820 --> 01:47.930
so quit your bitchin'.

01:48.010 --> 01:50.440
All right, moving on. We
got to hurry up here.

01:50.480 --> 01:51.950
It's only a week till the shower.

01:52.020 --> 01:54.250
What's the big hurry? She's
not even showing yet.

01:54.290 --> 01:55.780
I got to get the loot now.

01:56.480 --> 01:58.540
This is a geriatric pregnancy.

01:59.330 --> 02:01.560
If I even walk fast, I
could knock it loose.

02:01.630 --> 02:03.280
It's not a tooth.

02:03.300 --> 02:05.330
It doesn't come out if
you bite into an apple.

02:06.130 --> 02:08.850
Hola, Emilio. Can I get a water?

02:08.860 --> 02:10.830
And I'll have an horchata with rum.

02:10.870 --> 02:13.720
Un agua y un "Cuban Missile Crisis."

02:15.040 --> 02:17.040
Te escuché hablar sobre el baby shower.

02:17.130 --> 02:18.680
No, no, English, Emilio.

02:18.730 --> 02:20.290
We've been working hard. Let's hear it.

02:20.380 --> 02:22.630
I'm sorry, Professor Jackie.

02:24.120 --> 02:26.450
I would like to go to my baby shower,

02:26.520 --> 02:28.540
but I think Becky is
not wanting me there.

02:28.550 --> 02:30.680
Oh, well, that's 'cause she doesn't know

02:30.700 --> 02:32.080
what a good man you are. You just come

02:32.100 --> 02:33.220
and bring a nice gift.

02:33.260 --> 02:37.230
Something that says, "Lighten
up. Half that baby's mine."

02:37.330 --> 02:40.200
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Blue.

02:40.250 --> 02:41.959
I love this hair.

02:41.960 --> 02:43.719
What the hell is Blue doing here?

02:43.720 --> 02:46.570
That's Blue? She's attractive.

02:46.610 --> 02:48.510
I guess David doesn't have a type.

02:49.930 --> 02:52.440
Hey, Darlene.

02:52.530 --> 02:53.910
Hey, Blue.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.210
Um, this is my sister
Becky and my aunt Jackie.

02:57.280 --> 02:58.880
Uh, what you doing here?

02:58.950 --> 03:01.120
Well, I heard about
your sister's shower,

03:01.190 --> 03:02.570
and I just wanted to say

03:02.660 --> 03:05.190
that I'm part of a women's
blessing-way group

03:05.200 --> 03:08.900
where we perform ceremonies
that pamper mothers-to-be.

03:08.920 --> 03:10.060
And we would love to come.

03:10.080 --> 03:12.460
Oh, darn, too late.

03:12.480 --> 03:13.900
We already locked down the theme,

03:13.970 --> 03:15.879
which is teddy bears and teacups.

03:15.880 --> 03:18.660
And the shower color
is SpongeBob yellow.

03:18.680 --> 03:20.470
So there's nothing left to do.

03:20.510 --> 03:23.870
Yeah, a-and it's just gonna be
Becky's friends and family.

03:23.940 --> 03:26.240
Very small group. People
who have been invited.

03:26.260 --> 03:27.270
You understand.

03:28.160 --> 03:30.310
Hold on. Do these people bring gifts?

03:30.420 --> 03:32.950
- Of course.
- Store-bought gifts?

03:32.970 --> 03:35.720
Or just a rock with the
word "Peace" painted on it?

03:35.770 --> 03:39.940
Store-bought, with gift receipts
so you can get the cash.

03:42.060 --> 03:44.310
Move over, Darlene.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.650
Move!

03:48.000 --> 03:54.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

04:23.240 --> 04:24.350
"The Conners" is recorded

04:24.380 --> 04:26.270
in front of a live studio audience.

04:26.360 --> 04:29.100
Ben is nothing short of a visionary.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.979
I mean, publishing an indie tabloid

04:30.980 --> 04:32.940
like Lock 'Em Up in King County,

04:32.960 --> 04:34.860
a financially long-suffering community

04:34.960 --> 04:36.700
that loves to see others fail?

04:36.800 --> 04:38.700
Please.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.700
What I like to see is some
hot-shot from the mayor's office

04:41.750 --> 04:44.370
get caught doing something
sketchy in the park.

04:44.470 --> 04:46.210
Oh, yeah, yeah.

04:46.290 --> 04:49.360
Back when I was on the
force, I'd be the bait.

04:49.460 --> 04:51.490
Um...

04:52.500 --> 04:57.300
But my... my biggest
collar was Kit & Kat...

04:58.330 --> 05:01.320
... Lanford's legendary
married real-estate team.

05:01.340 --> 05:03.140
They'd do anything to sell you a house.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.260
They'd also do anything
to get some strange

05:05.340 --> 05:08.230
to spice up their sick marriage.

05:08.340 --> 05:10.390
Aunt Jackie, they're kids.

05:10.510 --> 05:13.010
I left out that they
were murdered in prison.

05:13.100 --> 05:15.720
Um, I got to go meet Peter,

05:15.740 --> 05:18.100
but it was very nice meeting you, Ben.

05:18.190 --> 05:20.400
Yes.

05:23.660 --> 05:26.060
You got a crazy aunt in your family?

05:26.160 --> 05:28.079
Well, I was gonna say, "Yeah."

05:28.080 --> 05:30.780
But now that I saw that, I'm
just gonna call her my aunt.

05:33.370 --> 05:36.790
Uh, just so you know, we're not
always this fun and exciting.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.510
Kids, tell him about your day.

05:38.540 --> 05:41.460
Well, my music teacher said
that I have perfect pitch

05:41.540 --> 05:43.130
and, if I learn to play an instrument,

05:43.210 --> 05:44.830
she'll put me in the school
orchestra next year.

05:44.840 --> 05:45.850
Oh.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.100
Can I learn piano?

05:47.220 --> 05:49.430
Piano lessons cost a lot of money.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.940
But hey, nobody's using that harmonica

05:52.050 --> 05:53.590
we found on the bus.

05:53.690 --> 05:56.090
On the bus?

05:56.190 --> 05:58.090
I thought it tasted like tobacco.

05:59.780 --> 06:01.779
Well, Ben, don't you play piano?

06:01.780 --> 06:04.760
I do, and I have a portable keyboard.

06:04.820 --> 06:06.870
I'd be happy to come
over and teach Mark.

06:06.970 --> 06:09.180
No charge, but you got to be willing

06:09.200 --> 06:10.900
to work hard and practice.

06:10.970 --> 06:13.340
Absolutely. Is it okay with you, Mom?

06:13.410 --> 06:14.710
Sure. I mean, normally,

06:14.740 --> 06:16.740
I'd be uncomfortable with
somebody doing this for free,

06:16.760 --> 06:18.710
but my boss doesn't pay
me squat, so thank you.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.590
So? What did you think of Ben?

06:25.670 --> 06:26.870
He's got a great job,

06:26.960 --> 06:29.160
a sense of humor, one hell of a beard,

06:29.240 --> 06:31.160
and the kids seem to like him.

06:31.180 --> 06:34.660
But I guess you'll know more
after the piano lesson, huh?

06:35.230 --> 06:36.330
What are you talking about?

06:36.380 --> 06:38.800
I think an opportunity to test him

06:38.820 --> 06:40.970
fell right in your lap
and you're taking it.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.370
No, I'm just gonna watch
how Ben and Mark interact,

06:44.440 --> 06:46.340
and then act accordingly
based on the result.

06:46.380 --> 06:48.470
So if you want to call
that a test, well, okay,

06:48.480 --> 06:50.540
'cause that's exactly what it is.

06:50.580 --> 06:53.360
I-I know you want to see what
kind of a stepdad he might be,

06:53.380 --> 06:54.746
but why don't you just tell him that

06:54.770 --> 06:56.580
instead of treating him like a lab rat?

06:56.650 --> 06:58.990
Because then he'll just
treat the kids nicely.

07:00.520 --> 07:03.260
Nobody wants that.

07:09.830 --> 07:12.040
This isn't a real baby shower.

07:12.100 --> 07:14.480
We should be microwaving
candy bars into diapers

07:14.570 --> 07:17.040
so people can sniff 'em
and guess what's inside.

07:17.110 --> 07:18.740
I've had enough of this. Okay, ladies,

07:18.760 --> 07:21.530
it is time to play a super-fun,

07:21.580 --> 07:24.950
more-traditional
baby-shower game called...

07:25.010 --> 07:26.730
"Tinkle in the Pot"!

07:26.850 --> 07:29.920
We'll get it going like
this. Here's my nickel.

07:29.950 --> 07:33.770
And we got to get to the pot.

07:33.860 --> 07:36.120
How much fun is that?

07:36.210 --> 07:37.360
Who's next?

07:37.460 --> 07:39.980
Or we could empower Becky

07:40.060 --> 07:43.230
by sharing beautiful birth experiences.

07:43.330 --> 07:44.700
Darlene?

07:44.800 --> 07:46.620
Oh. Sure.

07:46.740 --> 07:49.300
Um... well, they knocked me out,

07:49.340 --> 07:51.740
and I woke up with a
kid and a 12-inch scar.

07:51.810 --> 07:55.040
And then, the crazy thing is,
five years later I did it again.

07:55.110 --> 07:57.140
You're lucky, Darlene.

07:57.230 --> 07:59.280
Some women never get to experience

07:59.350 --> 08:00.880
the gift of having a child,

08:00.920 --> 08:04.200
because they have partners
who already have kids

08:04.240 --> 08:08.240
and refuse to consider having more.

08:08.360 --> 08:10.190
Sorry.

08:14.900 --> 08:16.300
That's strange.

08:16.370 --> 08:20.700
I thought it was gonna be really
noisy when I took these off.

08:23.340 --> 08:24.900
You okay?

08:25.020 --> 08:27.810
David doesn't want to
have any more children.

08:27.910 --> 08:29.940
And I'm pretty sure it's because

08:30.050 --> 08:33.740
he thinks you'll be mad if he
raises another family with me.

08:34.580 --> 08:37.220
Can you just tell him
you're okay with it?

08:37.320 --> 08:39.490
Wait, you want me to tell David

08:39.559 --> 08:42.350
to have another set of kids
that'll take more attention

08:42.380 --> 08:43.490
away from my kids?

08:43.559 --> 08:46.880
That would be great, thank you.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.960
You know there's no way
I'm gonna do that.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.179
I took the bus here.

08:52.180 --> 08:54.120
Can you give me a ride home?

08:54.170 --> 08:57.170
Uh, buses don't go both ways?

08:58.710 --> 09:00.270
All right.

09:03.500 --> 09:04.850
Geena, you're up.

09:04.860 --> 09:06.010
No, let me think.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.350
Do I really want to humiliate myself

09:08.380 --> 09:10.880
for the chance to win
a Bath & Body Works

09:10.950 --> 09:12.450
country-apple shower gel?

09:13.210 --> 09:15.060
Hell yeah, I will.

09:16.490 --> 09:19.630
Hey, everybody, the strippers are here!

09:21.350 --> 09:23.780
Hey, it's Emilio.

09:23.840 --> 09:27.330
I hope you don't mind, but he
just really wanted to be here.

09:27.440 --> 09:29.900
I made this for the baby.

09:30.010 --> 09:32.420
My papá made me one just like this

09:32.440 --> 09:35.740
when I was little, with wood
from a very, very old tree.

09:35.780 --> 09:38.480
Uh, this wood comes from Lowe's.

09:38.550 --> 09:41.450
Lowe's. That's good wood.

09:42.620 --> 09:45.350
Thank you, Emilio. I appreciate it.

09:46.800 --> 09:50.060
So... I guess I'll see
you at work tomorrow.

09:50.090 --> 09:54.090
Oh. Uh... okay.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.980
E-Enjoy your party.

09:59.540 --> 10:00.930
Can I talk to you for a second?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.116
I can't believe you just did that.

10:02.140 --> 10:03.940
I can't believe you invited him.

10:03.970 --> 10:05.620
You knew I didn't want him involved.

10:05.710 --> 10:07.279
Uh, well, I'm sorry, but he's the father

10:07.280 --> 10:08.339
and he's a great guy.

10:08.340 --> 10:09.940
Wait a minute. That's the baby's father?

10:09.980 --> 10:12.180
We are not talking about this, Dad.

10:12.280 --> 10:13.556
Thanks a lot.

10:13.580 --> 10:14.960
Mm.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.380
Hey, I've seen him in here before.

10:17.490 --> 10:19.240
- He's the busboy, right?
- Yeah.

10:19.270 --> 10:20.350
What do you know about him?

10:20.410 --> 10:21.940
Well, I know that he's hardworking,

10:22.040 --> 10:23.270
he's a devout Catholic,

10:23.340 --> 10:26.510
and he's offered to give Becky
what little money that he has.

10:26.580 --> 10:27.830
Is he here illegally?

10:27.860 --> 10:29.679
Well, who cares if he's illegal?

10:29.680 --> 10:31.149
Who cares if he's a busboy?

10:31.150 --> 10:32.840
A lot of people with
difficult beginnings

10:32.860 --> 10:35.320
have risen above their
station in life, Dan.

10:35.370 --> 10:36.790
I mean, nobody in our family,

10:36.890 --> 10:39.240
but I've read about it, and
it's pretty inspirational

10:39.260 --> 10:40.270
when it happens!

10:43.130 --> 10:45.460
All right, come on. Let's
hear your D-major scale.

10:50.670 --> 10:53.000
Uh, did you practice that at all?

10:53.110 --> 10:55.940
A little, but I got bored.
I wanted to learn a song.

10:56.010 --> 10:58.580
Come on, Mark. Now, this
is two weeks in a row

10:58.610 --> 11:00.800
I have asked you to learn your scales.

11:00.820 --> 11:03.450
If I wanted you to do songs,
I would have said do songs.

11:03.520 --> 11:05.020
Now let me hear the scale again.

11:05.120 --> 11:06.500
Okay, I think I can do better.

11:13.490 --> 11:16.160
Mm-hmm. Not better.

11:16.260 --> 11:17.690
Okay, but can you do this?

11:21.880 --> 11:23.600
Stop.

11:23.690 --> 11:26.760
Look, when I said I'd do this,

11:26.820 --> 11:29.080
you promised you'd work
hard and practice,

11:29.110 --> 11:30.440
and you haven't done either.

11:30.480 --> 11:32.590
Now, you said you wanted to
be in the school orchestra.

11:32.610 --> 11:34.280
- Well, do you or don't you?
- I do.

11:34.380 --> 11:35.410
Well, I can't tell.

11:35.510 --> 11:38.000
So if you are really serious about this,

11:38.020 --> 11:40.580
start acting like it, because
if you don't take it serious,

11:40.670 --> 11:42.170
you're never gonna make it.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.400
Enrique's mom is early.

11:45.420 --> 11:47.340
I have to go to soccer practice.

11:47.430 --> 11:48.980
Do you want me to tell her I'm sick?

11:49.090 --> 11:50.640
No, go to practice.

11:50.760 --> 11:52.680
Today was a waste of
time for both of us.

11:54.100 --> 11:55.350
You okay, honey?

11:55.430 --> 11:57.350
You have everything you
need for soccer practice?

11:57.400 --> 11:59.440
I'm fine. I got to go.

12:02.910 --> 12:04.820
Ugh.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.680
W-What were you doing?

12:08.760 --> 12:10.480
You were way too hard on him.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.720
Wait.

12:12.760 --> 12:16.740
Do I hear the faint whir of a
helicopter circling your child?

12:17.960 --> 12:21.660
I am not being overprotective.
You made my son cry.

12:21.730 --> 12:23.600
I am sorry that he cried,

12:23.700 --> 12:25.500
but he needed to hear
that he screwed up.

12:25.520 --> 12:26.800
How else does a kid learn?

12:26.890 --> 12:27.970
Oh, I don't know.

12:28.040 --> 12:30.370
Uh, encouragement, positive role models.

12:30.380 --> 12:32.510
Cash, if you're tired.

12:33.260 --> 12:34.490
Mark's a sensitive kid.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.426
He responds better to being rewarded.

12:36.450 --> 12:38.880
Yeah, well, the problem
with rewarding everything

12:38.900 --> 12:40.670
is it's the same as rewarding nothing.

12:40.700 --> 12:41.799
You want me to give him a trophy

12:41.800 --> 12:43.239
for playing "The Knuckle Song"?

12:43.240 --> 12:46.870
Uh, no, but I didn't expect
you to be the "Whiplash" guy.

12:46.930 --> 12:49.160
Look, coddling Mark

12:49.240 --> 12:51.330
is not gonna prepare him
for the real world.

12:51.410 --> 12:53.040
I think I'm preparing him just fine.

12:53.060 --> 12:55.480
How? By teaching him that
he can half-ass things

12:55.500 --> 12:56.880
and still succeed in life?

12:56.950 --> 13:00.250
Hey, Mark is not a
half-asser! That's Harris!

13:01.520 --> 13:04.090
And you know what? You're fired.

13:07.410 --> 13:10.300
It's gonna take me 10 minutes
to break all this stuff down.

13:10.340 --> 13:12.340
It might be a little
awkward unless you help.

13:17.460 --> 13:18.860
That's another way to go.

13:24.510 --> 13:25.830
Emilio, right?

13:25.930 --> 13:29.580
Yes. And you're Becky's papá.

13:29.670 --> 13:31.770
Uh, she does not want me
in the life of the baby

13:31.800 --> 13:34.940
and you are here to fight
me and drive me away.

13:34.990 --> 13:36.710
I'm not here to fight.

13:36.790 --> 13:38.510
Oh, good, good.

13:38.590 --> 13:42.110
You have the face of a
kind but violent man.

13:44.020 --> 13:47.030
Jackie tells me you want
to help with the baby.

13:47.050 --> 13:48.070
Yes.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.890
What kind of work can you do?

13:49.950 --> 13:53.120
Oh, I-I can build cars, make furniture,

13:53.220 --> 13:55.290
work in a factory.

13:55.330 --> 13:57.360
Sadly, all those jobs went to Mexico.

13:57.460 --> 13:59.700
You ever hang drywall?

13:59.730 --> 14:03.200
Of course. Any estúpido
could hang drywall.

14:04.200 --> 14:07.920
Well, that's about as good
as an interview gets.

14:08.010 --> 14:10.960
How would you like a second
job hanging drywall for me?

14:11.010 --> 14:12.610
- Really?
- Yes.

14:12.710 --> 14:14.740
I... I accept.

14:14.850 --> 14:17.279
Oh, and also, por favor, uh,

14:17.280 --> 14:19.520
my speaking is not so good.

14:19.620 --> 14:23.350
In Spanish, "estúpido" means
"a smart and respected man."

14:24.390 --> 14:28.220
Look, I got to be honest with you.

14:28.290 --> 14:30.340
I don't like the way you got here.

14:30.360 --> 14:31.839
You broke the law

14:31.840 --> 14:34.530
and you could be putting
me in a bad situation,

14:34.600 --> 14:38.570
but I want to help my daughter,
so I have to help you.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.270
I understand.

14:40.320 --> 14:41.800
I expect you to give a good portion

14:41.820 --> 14:44.160
out of your paycheck
to Becky and the baby.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.340
Yes, yes, of course.

14:46.440 --> 14:49.010
Okay.

14:49.080 --> 14:51.280
Here's the address.

14:51.350 --> 14:54.200
And I will see you tomorrow
morning at 6:00 a.m.

14:54.290 --> 14:56.640
- I will be there.
- Okay.

14:57.470 --> 14:58.800
Oh, and for the record,

14:58.820 --> 15:02.440
if we were gonna fight, I'd
mop the floor with you.

15:06.460 --> 15:08.030
Hey.

15:08.100 --> 15:09.620
How was soccer practice?

15:09.700 --> 15:11.330
Okay.

15:11.420 --> 15:14.000
Listen, um...

15:14.040 --> 15:16.570
I know what happened
with Ben this afternoon,

15:16.660 --> 15:18.690
and I don't want you to worry.

15:18.780 --> 15:20.380
I canceled the piano lessons.

15:20.480 --> 15:22.850
- What? Why would you do that?
- Huh?

15:22.950 --> 15:26.320
I had a "You're welcome" all
loaded up and ready to go.

15:26.350 --> 15:28.080
I don't want to stop the lessons.

15:28.150 --> 15:29.590
Call Ben and get him back.

15:29.650 --> 15:30.990
But he made you cry.

15:31.090 --> 15:32.660
No, he didn't.

15:32.690 --> 15:34.610
I cried because I was mad at myself.

15:34.690 --> 15:36.660
He's trying to help me
get into the orchestra

15:36.680 --> 15:38.460
and I didn't practice my scales.

15:38.530 --> 15:40.180
Yeah, but you taught yourself a song.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.430
That's pretty great.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.070
You think everything I do is great.

15:43.130 --> 15:45.530
So when you say it, it
doesn't mean anything.

15:46.340 --> 15:48.620
Oh, well, if you'll remember
that for Mother's Day,

15:48.640 --> 15:50.970
I'd like to see that in glitter.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.370
You got to call him back.

15:53.640 --> 15:56.630
Um, how about you call him

15:56.650 --> 15:58.550
and tell him you want
to continue the lessons

15:58.650 --> 16:00.300
even though your mom was mostly right

16:00.320 --> 16:02.690
and made a lot of intelligent points?

16:02.770 --> 16:04.259
Do the hard work, Mom.

16:04.260 --> 16:05.659
It's the only way you learn.

16:05.660 --> 16:10.030
Uh, you say I'm never
critical? That was lame.

16:12.700 --> 16:14.540
That's a lie. It was very insightful.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.920
It was great, like everything you do.

16:20.360 --> 16:22.190
Dan!

16:22.200 --> 16:23.210
Oh, what now?

16:23.260 --> 16:26.630
You big softy.

16:26.640 --> 16:28.590
I know you're taking a
big risk with the union

16:28.630 --> 16:30.930
by hiring Emilio, but I
just want to tell you

16:30.940 --> 16:33.730
I think that you're the best!

16:33.840 --> 16:35.200
When the microwave dings,

16:35.300 --> 16:37.970
that's not only my popcorn
but the end of your time.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.460
You might want to pick up the pace.

16:39.480 --> 16:42.980
Okay. So, isn't Emilio wonderful?

16:43.030 --> 16:44.976
Of course, I was the first
person to see that in him,

16:45.000 --> 16:46.290
but now, while you...

16:46.310 --> 16:48.980
And that's all the time
we have for today!

16:49.070 --> 16:52.050
Tune in tomorrow when
Dan changes the locks.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.840
What is wrong with you people?!

16:56.930 --> 16:59.960
It's bad enough that Aunt Jackie
invited Emilio to the party.

17:00.030 --> 17:01.580
Now you're giving him a job?

17:01.660 --> 17:04.200
I gave him a job so he
could give you money,

17:04.220 --> 17:06.530
and... I see your point
about Aunt Jackie.

17:06.599 --> 17:10.000
I told both of you to stop doing this.

17:10.089 --> 17:11.839
Why are you pushing him into my life?

17:11.920 --> 17:13.520
Because you're being
stubborn and stupid.

17:13.540 --> 17:15.109
I'm sorry. I'm a life coach.

17:15.160 --> 17:16.759
You're being...

17:16.760 --> 17:20.520
overly rooted and intelligent adjacent.

17:20.790 --> 17:21.800
What is your problem?

17:21.819 --> 17:23.179
You know what my problem is?

17:23.180 --> 17:24.888
I've been doing fine.

17:24.890 --> 17:26.920
So why should I start
depending on somebody

17:26.990 --> 17:28.369
who might not be here when I need him?

17:28.390 --> 17:29.920
Look, nobody knows the future.

17:29.990 --> 17:31.160
He could get deported tomorrow.

17:31.180 --> 17:32.756
He could be around for another 20 years.

17:32.780 --> 17:35.840
All I'm saying is, the guy is here now.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.060
And he's the real deal. Take the help.

17:38.130 --> 17:40.920
Of all the guys that have, you know,

17:40.940 --> 17:42.650
frolicked in your garden...

17:45.370 --> 17:47.000
... you accidentally met one

17:47.010 --> 17:51.110
who's willing to stand by and
raise a flower with you.

17:53.820 --> 17:56.180
- I'll think about it, okay?
- Thank you.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.820
And by the way, from what Mom told me,

17:58.920 --> 18:01.550
your garden didn't exactly
have a fence around it.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.740
Oh!

18:08.560 --> 18:09.860
Um...

18:10.000 --> 18:12.340
Mark wants more piano lessons from you.

18:12.360 --> 18:13.810
I think that's all we
need to say about that.

18:13.820 --> 18:14.839
Let's get to work.

18:14.840 --> 18:16.520
Oh, no.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.490
Oh, no, no, no, no.

18:20.180 --> 18:22.880
Oh, there is so much more to say.

18:22.980 --> 18:25.340
I'm... I'm interested
in hearing how Mark

18:25.400 --> 18:27.150
was able to communicate
his wishes to you

18:27.200 --> 18:29.780
through his uncontrollable sobbing.

18:29.870 --> 18:31.450
Um, okay, fine.

18:31.490 --> 18:33.690
So he's tougher than I thought he was.

18:33.790 --> 18:35.090
But you were way too mean.

18:35.140 --> 18:38.170
Mark's great, and I think he could

18:38.200 --> 18:40.330
really benefit from having
somebody in his life

18:40.380 --> 18:42.860
that holds him a little bit
more accountable than you do.

18:42.930 --> 18:44.650
Well, that's debatable.

18:44.730 --> 18:46.770
But either way, when
push comes to shove,

18:46.800 --> 18:49.600
I have the final say
because I'm his mother.

18:49.690 --> 18:51.470
Well, unless you're wrong.

18:51.570 --> 18:53.870
No, I'm pretty positive I'm the mother.

18:56.740 --> 18:59.310
The point is, I passed your
little test, didn't I?

18:59.380 --> 19:01.660
Oh, I guess that code
wasn't as hard to crack

19:01.680 --> 19:03.026
as I thought it was.

19:03.050 --> 19:05.400
Well, good.

19:05.490 --> 19:07.800
Because something big has come up.

19:07.920 --> 19:11.000
I got an investor that
wants me to relocate

19:11.030 --> 19:12.760
Lock 'Em Up to Chicago.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.759
Oh, wow, that's like

19:14.760 --> 19:16.429
- an hour from here.
- Mm-hmm.

19:16.430 --> 19:19.130
I mean, driving away from
Lanford sounds really good,

19:19.230 --> 19:21.270
but the drive back's gonna
be pretty depressing.

19:21.370 --> 19:23.400
Hmm.

19:23.500 --> 19:27.340
You know, I've got a way you
could cut down on the commute.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.640
You and the kids could move in with me.

19:30.750 --> 19:33.150
Wait a second. Um...

19:33.210 --> 19:35.110
I don't know if I heard you right.

19:35.180 --> 19:36.730
Are you asking me to move in with you?

19:36.820 --> 19:39.490
No, but it's a great idea.
What do you say?

19:41.970 --> 19:43.720
I say that sounds amazing.

19:43.810 --> 19:45.740
Yeah. I know it's a lot.

19:45.810 --> 19:49.010
It's just that, even though
we work together all day,

19:49.100 --> 19:51.810
it feels like I never have
enough time with you.

19:51.920 --> 19:54.880
Yeah, I-I mean, I feel the same way.

19:58.470 --> 20:00.579
I-I've just got to talk to my family

20:00.580 --> 20:01.659
- and my kids.
- Yes.

20:01.660 --> 20:03.230
Take your time, you know.

20:03.310 --> 20:05.219
But not too much time because,

20:05.220 --> 20:07.199
you know, at your age...

20:07.200 --> 20:08.900
- Careful.
- All right.

20:08.980 --> 20:11.400
Hang on. You didn't let me finish.

20:11.490 --> 20:14.400
All I was gonna say is, at your age,

20:14.540 --> 20:16.290
you don't have a lot of options.

20:16.370 --> 20:18.340
Now, are you ready to move in?

20:18.460 --> 20:20.780
I'm close. If you can just call me

20:20.800 --> 20:23.180
"plain" and "sturdy," I think
that'll seal the deal.

20:26.800 --> 20:29.940
Look, I know I've been
a little hard on you,

20:29.980 --> 20:31.670
and I'm sorry.

20:31.770 --> 20:33.840
I get that you want to be
part of the baby's life,

20:33.900 --> 20:37.640
