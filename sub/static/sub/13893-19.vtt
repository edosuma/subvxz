WEBVTT

00:11.195 --> 00:12.495
All right, listen up.

00:12.705 --> 00:14.895
The cart needs a new suspension system,

00:14.895 --> 00:16.735
I don't know why that would be.

00:18.395 --> 00:20.265
The old cemetery is falling apart

00:20.265 --> 00:22.705
and the house is in need of general repairs.

00:22.755 --> 00:24.425
What's wrong with the house?

00:25.205 --> 00:27.345
That's what wrong with the house.

00:27.345 --> 00:30.215
The problem is, we don't have the money to fix any of it.

00:30.215 --> 00:32.075
So does anyone have any ideas

00:32.075 --> 00:34.895
for how we can raise the money to cover these costs?

00:35.945 --> 00:37.195
Yes, Rigby?

00:37.225 --> 00:38.565
What's in it for us?

00:38.675 --> 00:43.875
If you come up with something successful, you'll get a... paid day off.

00:44.225 --> 00:45.385
- What? - Hey,

00:45.435 --> 00:48.665
I got some choice sports equipment in the shed!

00:48.665 --> 00:52.305
Let's have a sports tournament, and get physic--

00:54.255 --> 00:55.595
Any other ideas?

00:55.775 --> 00:57.415
- A bake sale! - No.

00:57.415 --> 00:58.725
A concert?

00:59.715 --> 01:01.115
- Oh! Hey Benson-- - No.

01:01.115 --> 01:02.205
- We could-- - No.

01:02.325 --> 01:04.025
Come on, Benson, just hear us out!

01:04.875 --> 01:06.705
Fine. What is it?

01:06.705 --> 01:08.105
We could have a scary movie night!

01:08.105 --> 01:09.835
Yeah, in the abandoned cemetery!

01:09.835 --> 01:12.085
You guys want to see a scary movie there?

01:12.215 --> 01:13.275
Yes.

01:13.885 --> 01:16.565
You know what? That could actually work.

01:16.655 --> 01:18.155
That's not a bad idea!

01:18.155 --> 01:19.485
Aw, what?

01:19.485 --> 01:22.395
Yeah. We had a movie night there a long time ago.

01:22.395 --> 01:24.215
It was a huge success!

01:24.245 --> 01:28.715
A night of the macabre in the crypt! How exciting!

01:28.895 --> 01:30.605
Alright, it's settled then.

01:30.605 --> 01:32.435
Skips, you'll set up the chairs.

01:32.805 --> 01:34.955
Pops, you'll be in charge of concession.

01:35.825 --> 01:38.795
Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost, you'll be in charge of decoration duties.

01:39.465 --> 01:41.025
I'll be in charge of admissions.

01:41.155 --> 01:42.575
Mordecai and Rigby...

01:42.965 --> 01:45.585
You're in charge of getting the movie and getting the word out.

01:45.585 --> 01:48.705
But if this doesn't work, you won't be getting a paid day off.

01:48.765 --> 01:50.715
Pfft, it's gonna work.

01:50.715 --> 01:53.465
♪ Because we know everything about scary movies, ♪

01:53.465 --> 01:55.905
♪ and you know nothing about scary movies! ♪

01:55.905 --> 01:58.275
♪ We'll save the park with our knowledge of scary movies! ♪

01:58.275 --> 02:00.605
Stop singing or you're fired!

02:00.605 --> 02:02.795
♪ Our... knowledge... of... scary... movies. ♪

02:03.665 --> 02:04.805
We'll go get the movie.

02:06.645 --> 02:07.835
You find anything yet?

02:07.835 --> 02:09.375
We gotta get this one!

02:09.375 --> 02:12.465
Mounties Of Death: Hoser Spree!

02:12.685 --> 02:14.385
Eh, the book was better.

02:14.575 --> 02:17.515
Oh, this is a classic of Italian horror!

02:17.515 --> 02:19.185
Libraria!

02:19.185 --> 02:21.945
Dude, what is with you? Nobody's gonna want to read subtitles!

02:21.945 --> 02:24.565
Oh, so you guys think you know about horror?

02:24.665 --> 02:25.975
Come into my lair.

02:26.785 --> 02:28.595
This is from my personal stash.

02:30.865 --> 02:33.555
Zombocalypse 3D!

02:33.665 --> 02:35.795
Oh yeah, I saw this a few years back.

02:35.795 --> 02:36.715
No you didn't.

02:36.715 --> 02:37.195
Huh?

02:37.195 --> 02:39.525
This is the foreign boot-leg director's cut.

02:39.605 --> 02:42.975
3 hours and 28 minutes of remastered Peter Pan's horror

02:42.975 --> 02:45.185
and gore that will make your eye balls barf!

02:45.185 --> 02:45.765
Wait.

02:46.485 --> 02:48.405
What kind of tape is this?

02:48.605 --> 02:50.665
Duh,zaidamax 3D,

02:50.685 --> 02:53.535
it's like the onlt way to truly experience this movie.

02:53.535 --> 02:54.595
Of course you'll need...

02:56.695 --> 02:57.865
one of these babys.

02:57.995 --> 03:00.025
The zaidamax decktron L O X.

03:00.125 --> 03:02.525
It'll make those zombies really pop.

03:04.355 --> 03:05.455
We'll take it

03:05.545 --> 03:06.615
Wise choise.

03:06.715 --> 03:08.885
Here you guys are gonna need some of these babies

03:09.275 --> 03:10.565
I'll go ring you guys up.

03:10.775 --> 03:12.525
Paid day-off!

04:10.305 --> 04:13.615
Get your candy cob webs on a stick!

04:16.635 --> 04:19.725
I can't believe it. They actually did it!

04:19.725 --> 04:22.945
I STILL think we should of had a sports tournament.

04:22.955 --> 04:26.525
If this movie night fails, which I know it will,

04:26.615 --> 04:29.765
I've got my sports gear here as a back-up plan.

04:31.015 --> 04:33.575
You dudes are gonna thank me for this.

04:40.995 --> 04:43.575
I was your average everyday kinda guy

04:43.585 --> 04:46.405
but that was before it all happened.

04:46.725 --> 04:49.755
Before the satellite triggered the deadly mecro virus

04:49.755 --> 04:51.995
and took everything I ever knew.

04:53.595 --> 04:55.065
Batter up!

04:56.915 --> 05:00.865
This is Zombocalypse 3D!

05:10.595 --> 05:14.085
Don't worry baby. I got these suckers.

05:14.315 --> 05:15.105
Baby?

05:17.605 --> 05:18.705
Oh great!

05:21.475 --> 05:22.675
Oh man, oh man, oh man!

05:22.675 --> 05:26.685
Baby, you let yourself go real bad.

05:34.075 --> 05:35.915
Dude, why did you do that?

05:35.915 --> 05:37.545
I didn't know you'd freak out that bad.

05:37.545 --> 05:39.575
Hey I want my money back!

05:44.925 --> 05:47.615
Fix it! Fix it!

05:47.845 --> 05:49.075
Come on, come on!

05:53.005 --> 05:54.755
Aw, why did you spit on it?

05:54.755 --> 05:56.125
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

05:59.675 --> 06:01.155
Dude, why isn't it working?

06:01.995 --> 06:06.185
Fix it! Fix it!

06:13.645 --> 06:14.925
Ow my kidneys!

06:21.795 --> 06:23.865
Aw dude, you put it in backwards!

06:24.475 --> 06:25.265
There.

06:34.085 --> 06:37.215
Thanks for almost getting rid of our paid day-off, you loser.

06:46.325 --> 06:48.895
The zombies really do pop out at you.

06:48.945 --> 06:52.135
Totally. That one is coming really far off the screen.

06:52.685 --> 06:55.225
Wait, we're not wearing our 3D glasses.

06:58.415 --> 06:59.955
Hey guys, check this out.

06:59.955 --> 07:01.845
That's a real zombie!

07:02.495 --> 07:04.985
Oh man, oh man, what do we do?!

07:06.695 --> 07:07.935
Hey, worm bait!

07:09.585 --> 07:10.745
Heads up.

07:11.075 --> 07:12.865
Muscle Man's sport stuff!

07:19.315 --> 07:21.125
Dude, nice shot.

07:21.635 --> 07:23.195
What's happening now?!

07:23.195 --> 07:27.385
Okay genius, let me put this in terms that you'll understand.

07:27.525 --> 07:31.165
The thing you just did, it's woken up the dead

07:31.165 --> 07:33.415
and they're ticked off!

07:38.405 --> 07:41.175
Dude, if anyone gets hurt, we won't get our paid day-off.

07:41.205 --> 07:43.255
We gotta keep the zombies away from the people.

07:47.585 --> 07:49.235
Oh cool.

07:49.925 --> 07:52.935
Aw man, zombie just took a hit!

07:58.915 --> 08:02.665
Whoa, did you see that zombie get a discus to the face?

08:14.225 --> 08:15.775
No!

08:16.125 --> 08:20.965
Yo guys! I told you this stuff would come in handy!

08:24.375 --> 08:25.545
Duck!

08:35.784 --> 08:40.845
Better fire up the grill 'cause I got me a zombie-kabob!

08:43.664 --> 08:47.955
Now, now. Don't crowd, there's enough for everybody.

08:47.955 --> 08:48.885
Pops!

08:52.975 --> 08:57.315
Hey worm hole! Get a tasty lick of this!

09:00.835 --> 09:03.435
This is awesome.

09:13.075 --> 09:14.925
Dude, I think we got them all.

09:26.115 --> 09:27.605
Skips, look out!

09:33.575 --> 09:34.955
Oh no.

09:48.935 --> 09:51.425
Ugh, he's just too strong.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.175
Mordecai! A cart!

09:58.585 --> 10:01.715
Okay you lousy, undead creep-

10:01.715 --> 10:03.555
You've taken a lot from me

10:03.605 --> 10:06.895
but if you think you're gonna deprive me of my

10:06.895 --> 10:08.675
-paid day-off-

10:08.675 --> 10:10.675
You're surely mistaken!

10:32.295 --> 10:34.395
Dude, I think we totally did it.

10:36.355 --> 10:40.265
That was great! It felt like I was in the actual movie!

10:40.265 --> 10:41.325
Aw man,

10:41.465 --> 10:43.935
you guys totally earned that paid day-off.

10:46.445 --> 10:50.705
And you're gonna earn another one cause we're doing tomorrow night,

10:50.705 --> 10:53.195
the exact same way.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.545
Do you think we can take that paid day-off tomorrow?
