WEBVTT

03:44.099 --> 03:45.392
Good morning.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.148
There's people in the hotel, you know.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.609
I don't see anyone.

03:53.692 --> 03:55.444
They can take pictures.

03:55.527 --> 03:56.779
That's okay.

03:57.863 --> 03:59.698
I'm very photogenic.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.416
The whole thing's so unfair.

04:10.626 --> 04:11.877
I can't get over it.

04:13.671 --> 04:16.048
One of the happiest,

04:16.130 --> 04:19.051
most perfectly romantic
couples we've ever known.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.845
There's no perfection, though.
They have their grievances.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.848
You seen my yellow cashmere sweater?

04:25.724 --> 04:29.144
To think one of them is gonna be suddenly
taken away from the other by this...

04:30.771 --> 04:31.855
This thing.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.693
This horrible thing.

04:36.443 --> 04:39.655
Makes me lose faith in love itself.

04:39.738 --> 04:41.824
So romantic all of a sudden.

04:43.158 --> 04:44.285
Don't be cynical.

04:45.828 --> 04:49.540
Your father's going from romantic bliss
to tears and despair.

04:54.753 --> 04:56.463
I have to stop the bread.

04:56.547 --> 04:58.382
Oh, don't start, please.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.758
I'm gaining weight.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.396
It's impossible to pretend
we're enjoying this trip.

05:14.857 --> 05:16.984
It's a brutal thing she did.

05:17.067 --> 05:20.070
Getting us all to come
here at a time like this.

05:20.154 --> 05:22.364
You're sure it wasn't your father's idea?

05:22.448 --> 05:23.699
What do you think?

06:25.260 --> 06:27.846
We call that <i>La Fonte dos Noivados.</i>

06:27.930 --> 06:30.391
The Engagement Fountain.

06:30.474 --> 06:34.853
The tile work is from the late 18th century
from the reign of Do? a Maria I.

06:34.937 --> 06:38.148
At that time,
unmarried girls from all over the region

06:38.232 --> 06:40.984
would come here to drink
from this ancient fountain.

06:41.068 --> 06:44.321
They would do this pilgrimage
because there was a belief

06:44.405 --> 06:47.658
that the waters would help them
find a good husband.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.453
And did it work?

06:51.537 --> 06:53.997
- They say so.
- How magnificent.

06:55.290 --> 06:57.000
If only it was so easy.

06:58.377 --> 07:00.838
You look tired today.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.714
Did you not get enough sleep?

07:02.798 --> 07:04.633
Oh, thank you very much.

07:04.716 --> 07:07.678
That's so nice to hear
first thing in the morning.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.139
I'm sorry. I didn't...

07:10.222 --> 07:12.850
Anyway, tired is sexy.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.059
Luciana!

07:15.602 --> 07:17.813
I'll pretend I believe you.

07:17.896 --> 07:19.523
It's 14 euros.

07:21.233 --> 07:23.068
His eyes are puffy.

07:23.152 --> 07:24.486
He's been crying.

07:27.823 --> 07:31.743
Have a nice day,
Mr. Jimmy. Say hello to the madam.

07:31.827 --> 07:34.163
I have terrible allergies,
if you wanna know.

07:34.246 --> 07:37.332
My husband too. It's
awful this time of the year.

07:37.499 --> 07:38.709
Thank you.

07:42.421 --> 07:43.547
Will this one do?

07:45.257 --> 07:46.967
Oh, wait a minute.

07:47.050 --> 07:48.886
Yeah, isn't it gorgeous?

07:48.969 --> 07:50.429
Is it real?

07:50.512 --> 07:54.349
Yeah. Burmese gold and champagne diamonds,
Pomellato vintage.

07:55.225 --> 07:59.146
It was given to me by a man I knew
between Michel and your father.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.272
I was very young.

08:01.190 --> 08:04.276
It was a long time ago.
There were quite a few, you know.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.278
I never wear it.

08:06.361 --> 08:09.865
Not because of your father, Jimmy
doesn't care, but it's a bit flashy, no?

08:09.948 --> 08:13.160
No, not at all. It is exquisite.

08:13.243 --> 08:16.455
I'm always afraid it'll get stolen
or something, but now I'm like:

08:17.831 --> 08:19.416
"What the hell?"

08:19.500 --> 08:21.126
- Can I try?
- Sure.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.806
He must have really loved you, this man.

08:34.890 --> 08:36.767
Loved? I don't know.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.144
He liked me, and he was rich.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.773
I try never to confuse money and love.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.817
He said the colors were perfect for me,
whatever that means.

08:51.323 --> 08:53.450
- There's a leak in my room.
- Really?

08:54.701 --> 08:55.702
Switch rooms.

08:55.786 --> 08:57.955
Oh, I asked. Nothing available.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.623
Was the water dripping on you?

08:59.706 --> 09:02.751
No, it's in the corner,
but still, it's all night.

09:02.834 --> 09:05.128
Drip, drip, drip.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.839
Drip, drip, drip. It's impossible.

09:07.923 --> 09:09.758
You're too sensitive.

09:09.841 --> 09:10.968
You want to switch rooms?

09:11.051 --> 09:12.970
You wanna sleep with my husband?

09:14.012 --> 09:17.307
The question is,
do you want to sleep with your husband?

09:17.391 --> 09:19.726
- That's none of your business.
- You started this.

09:19.810 --> 09:23.021
Children, I haven't even had my coffee yet.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.525
I'm gonna get some sun.

09:27.568 --> 09:29.945
You should try it sometime,
Paul. Be good for your skin.

09:32.447 --> 09:33.782
Vivi!

09:35.576 --> 09:37.911
Oh, sorry. Forgot.

09:39.621 --> 09:42.749
Don't forget sunscreen,
especially there on the side.

09:43.625 --> 09:46.169
Sun can be so unforgiving to your wrinkles.

10:05.397 --> 10:06.857
Mom, I'm so unhappy.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.151
Of course you are.

10:09.234 --> 10:10.485
Spare me the irony.

10:11.445 --> 10:14.656
Paul, if anyone has a reason
to complain, it's me.

10:15.532 --> 10:18.285
You must admit this vacation
is far from idyllic.

10:21.038 --> 10:22.748
But it's all good for you.

10:23.332 --> 10:24.791
You're moving to New York.

10:26.043 --> 10:28.378
You're young, in good health.

10:28.462 --> 10:29.880
The weather is gorgeous.

10:32.591 --> 10:35.510
All in one of the most
beautiful places on earth.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.222
I think I'm in love with Anne-Sophie.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.223
Oh, no.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.434
Please, that's not possible!

10:42.517 --> 10:43.517
How come?

10:43.560 --> 10:47.481
You stay with these girls two years,
wondering if you love them.

10:47.564 --> 10:48.899
So they leave you.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.735
As soon as they're gone,
you discover you're in love.

10:52.486 --> 10:53.820
It can't go on.

10:53.904 --> 10:57.282
Anne-Sophie, Beatrice, Julie.
You go around in circles nonstop.

10:58.575 --> 11:01.161
Anne-Sophie and you,
it was over two years ago.

11:02.037 --> 11:04.081
You can't possibly still love her.

11:05.957 --> 11:08.543
You're the one
who believes in eternal love.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.802
Eternal love? I wouldn't go that far.

11:18.387 --> 11:22.099
You and Jimmy seem more in love now
than when you first met.

11:22.974 --> 11:25.227
Paul, she left you. It's absurd.

11:26.770 --> 11:29.648
Meet the right woman,
and you'll forget Anne-Sophie.

11:29.731 --> 11:32.192
And you know the right woman for me?

11:33.026 --> 11:34.653
Yes, maybe.

11:36.697 --> 11:37.698
Great.

12:08.019 --> 12:09.646
Jimmy.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.356
Sorry. Can I help you?

12:11.440 --> 12:13.650
Yes. I'm lost.

12:13.734 --> 12:16.278
Well, I'm not a local here,
but where are you going?

12:16.361 --> 12:17.612
Hey, Jimmy, it's me.

12:17.696 --> 12:19.823
It's me. It's Ilene.

12:19.906 --> 12:23.243
I worked with Frankie in New York,
on the Noah Baumbach movie.

12:23.326 --> 12:24.494
I was her hairstylist. I...

12:24.578 --> 12:26.747
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

12:28.874 --> 12:30.709
Oh, my God. What a small world.

12:30.792 --> 12:33.044
Yeah, well, didn't Frankie mention?

12:33.128 --> 12:36.298
- Yeah, no, she talks about you all the time.
- Oh, well, that's really sweet.

12:36.381 --> 12:38.216
Yeah. In all my years in the film business,

12:38.300 --> 12:41.011
she's the only actress
I've become really great friends with.

12:41.094 --> 12:44.222
- Yeah.
- You know, with distance, it can be hard to keep up.

12:44.306 --> 12:49.060
Absolutely. You know what, it was just the other day, I
was trying to remember the restaurant you brought us to.

12:49.144 --> 12:51.229
- The last time we were in New York?
- Which one?

12:51.313 --> 12:55.609
I don't know. I was trying to recommend it to a
friend. A classic American steakhouse, really good.

12:55.692 --> 12:58.987
- It's Keens, on 36th Street.
- That's it. Absolutely amazing.

12:59.070 --> 13:00.155
Yeah. Yeah.

13:00.238 --> 13:03.325
- You like that mutton chop, huh?
- Oh, I love that mutton chop.

13:03.408 --> 13:05.410
Was that the last time we saw you?

13:05.494 --> 13:07.454
I thought maybe London also?

13:07.537 --> 13:10.624
No, no, I haven't been to London.
I'm hoping to get there.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.083
Anyway, what are you doing here?

13:12.167 --> 13:15.253
I've been in Spain. I've been
working on the new <i>Star Wars</i> movie.

13:15.337 --> 13:17.964
Oh, does this mean
Chewbacca's getting a new hairdo?

13:18.048 --> 13:22.719
- I tried a Farrah Fawcett on him, but...
- Hey, hey, hey. We signed a confidentiality agreement.

13:23.887 --> 13:25.555
- It's okay.
- It's ridiculous.

13:25.639 --> 13:28.558
But it's <i>Star Wars,</i>
and they're serious about it.

13:28.642 --> 13:30.894
I'm sorry. I'm Gary.
I'm the second unit DP.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.396
This is Jimmy. This is Frankie's husband.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.315
You're Fran? Oise CrÃ©mont's husband?

13:35.398 --> 13:36.983
- That's right.
- I'm a big fan.

13:37.067 --> 13:39.319
- Wow, you're a lucky man.
- I know I am.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.447
So did you find it?

13:42.531 --> 13:44.658
Nobody knows. No, I...

13:44.741 --> 13:48.995
I can't understand these people,
or they can't understand me.

13:49.079 --> 13:52.916
It's strange, because I thought
it's supposed to be either...

13:52.999 --> 13:54.376
Maybe I can help.

13:54.459 --> 13:57.170
Michel, this is Ilene,

13:57.254 --> 13:59.130
a good friend of Frankie's from New York.

13:59.214 --> 14:02.300
- And this is...
- Hi. Gary Tomlinson.

14:02.384 --> 14:05.720
- I'm Frankie's first husband.
- Yeah, Paul's dad.

14:05.804 --> 14:08.932
Oh, I've heard so much about you.

14:10.016 --> 14:14.271
- I'm not sure I like the sound of that.
- No, no, no. No, all good things.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.315
Frankie says that you have the
best seafood restaurant in all of Paris.

14:17.399 --> 14:20.026
The best? I don't know,
that's very Frankie.

14:22.737 --> 14:26.825
- This is Tiago, a true local, born and raised here in Sintra.
- Hi.

14:26.908 --> 14:28.743
- Ilene.
- Hi.

14:28.827 --> 14:33.290
- Where you trying to go?
- Quinta da Boika?

14:33.373 --> 14:35.750
Tiago, Quinta da Boika? Da Boika?

14:35.834 --> 14:38.545
- BoiÃ§a. BoiÃ§a, not "Boika."
- BoiÃ§a. Yeah.

14:38.628 --> 14:41.256
- That's why we couldn't find it.
- Here, I'll take you there.

14:41.339 --> 14:42.424
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Sure.

14:42.507 --> 14:44.467
- Okay. Nice meeting you.
- You too.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.472
You want a pastry?

14:50.265 --> 14:51.265
Please.

14:52.559 --> 14:55.854
Nice to see somebody in the movie industry
is prepared to take a pastry.

14:55.937 --> 14:58.356
I know. I eat everything.
It's the reason to travel.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.984
Well, this place is something else.
You're gonna love it.

15:01.943 --> 15:03.028
This is delicious.

15:06.740 --> 15:07.740
Take care.

15:09.826 --> 15:10.826
Ilene!

15:13.997 --> 15:15.540
Well, but that would cost a fortune.

15:15.624 --> 15:18.293
Listen,
my daughter's going to university soon.

15:19.377 --> 15:23.048
I don't need two bathrooms, and I don't
mind if we have to go a bit further west.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.385
Okay.

15:27.469 --> 15:28.469
Mom?

15:29.512 --> 15:32.974
For a comparison, maybe. It's just too far.

15:33.058 --> 15:34.058
What are you doing?

15:35.226 --> 15:37.729
Thank you. I'd appreciate that. Bye.

15:39.731 --> 15:41.816
Couldn't get any reception inside.

15:41.900 --> 15:43.276
Is this about the flat?

15:44.986 --> 15:46.863
And why would you think that?

15:46.947 --> 15:48.949
Because you look all sneaky there.

15:49.032 --> 15:50.825
I downloaded WhatsApp for you.

15:50.909 --> 15:53.620
You can use the Internet connection.
You don't need a phone line.

15:53.703 --> 15:55.705
I tried,
but you have to show me how to use it.

15:58.083 --> 16:00.877
Dad was asking if I
knew anything about a flat.

16:03.088 --> 16:04.381
Did you say anything?

16:05.548 --> 16:08.426
- Not much.
- What do you mean, "not much"?

16:09.427 --> 16:11.471
I said I didn't know.

16:11.554 --> 16:12.722
Good.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.015
No, that's not good.

16:23.858 --> 16:26.695
Honey, Maya, listen to me.

16:26.778 --> 16:28.321
- Let's not argue.
- What?

16:29.322 --> 16:31.157
Your father's just fishing around.

16:31.241 --> 16:33.410
He's looking for
something that isn't there.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.745
- You're insane.
- Don't use that word.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.163
Why not?

16:37.247 --> 16:41.334
You tell me lying is the worst thing I could
do ever, and then you ask me to lie for you.

16:41.418 --> 16:44.963
Maya, you're not lying.
You're just holding information.

16:45.797 --> 16:48.883
Your father shouldn't know anything
until there's something real to know.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.303
I'll tell him when the time's right.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.223
Don't you think he knows when I'm lying?

16:56.808 --> 17:00.437
- You always make me do this.
- I'm not making you. I'm sorry.

17:01.938 --> 17:04.148
I'm just struggling, that's all.

17:04.232 --> 17:05.483
Come here, baby.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.194
You're my best friend.

17:09.112 --> 17:12.449
- I don't wanna make you unhappy.
- Oh, please, Sylvia.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.951
I can't see how you moving out
won't make us more unhappy.

17:15.035 --> 17:16.994
Stop calling me Sylvia. I am your mother.

17:17.078 --> 17:20.165
Mother or best friend, which one is it?

17:20.248 --> 17:21.750
Why can't I be both?

17:25.336 --> 17:26.880
Maya, where are you going?

17:26.963 --> 17:29.424
- It's not Independence Day if I tell you.
- Stop.

17:30.425 --> 17:31.426
Look at me.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.429
Don't go very far.

17:34.512 --> 17:37.015
You know we're all meeting
at the Peninha in the afternoon.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.225
What's that?

17:39.309 --> 17:42.812
It's a place at the top of the mountain
that Frankie's determined for us all to see.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.565
I can't promise.

17:45.648 --> 17:47.358
Maya!

17:47.442 --> 17:48.902
It's for Frankie!

17:48.985 --> 17:51.613
Fuck Frankie! She's not
even my grandmother.

17:56.993 --> 18:00.413
- And how does she look?
- She looks great. She looks better.

18:01.206 --> 18:02.499
How long ago was that film?

18:04.084 --> 18:07.337
- Five years ago. Maybe six.
- Yeah.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.631
No, she was too skinny
when we were in New York.

18:10.799 --> 18:12.342
Maybe.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.177
She just looks more mature, you know?

18:14.260 --> 18:16.846
- Oh, please, Jimmy.
- What?

18:16.930 --> 18:19.766
I hate that word, "mature."

18:19.849 --> 18:21.392
It's offensive to a woman.

18:21.476 --> 18:23.019
Oh, I don't know.

18:26.147 --> 18:28.566
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if she and Paul get along?

18:29.818 --> 18:30.985
What are you talking about?

18:32.570 --> 18:34.739
New York can be a very lonely city.

18:34.823 --> 18:36.991
They would be good to each other.

18:37.075 --> 18:40.120
Ilene and Paul, Paul and Ilene.

18:40.203 --> 18:41.663
- Jesus.
- What?

18:41.746 --> 18:44.124
You invited her. This is all a plan.

18:44.207 --> 18:46.417
No,
I just think she would be perfect for him.

18:47.377 --> 18:50.505
Christ, Frankie,
you're playing Cupid again.

18:50.588 --> 18:53.174
Don't "Christ, Frankie" me.

18:53.258 --> 18:55.385
You of all people should understand.

18:56.386 --> 18:58.179
I don't want Paul to end up alone.

18:59.556 --> 19:02.684
But don't let the kids find out it was
your idea, because they'll go mad.

19:02.767 --> 19:06.604
- This was supposed to be a family trip.
- Well, it still is. It's...

19:07.397 --> 19:09.858
family with a plus one.

19:11.609 --> 19:15.113
You come up with all these
crazy scenarios in your head.

19:15.196 --> 19:17.365
You think you can manipulate everything,
don't you?

19:19.075 --> 19:20.368
I'm usually right.

19:22.954 --> 19:23.955
Okay.

19:27.125 --> 19:28.125
What?

19:29.210 --> 19:30.461
Well...

19:30.545 --> 19:33.298
- What's so funny?
- I've got news for you, darling.

19:33.381 --> 19:34.883
Yes, what?

19:34.966 --> 19:38.720
- Ilene has brought a friend.
- A friend?

19:38.803 --> 19:42.765
Yes. Ilene's accompanied by Gary,
I believe that's his name.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.226
A friend who looks very
much like her boyfriend...

19:45.310 --> 19:47.854
<i>Oh, mais non,</i>
she wasn't supposed to bring anyone.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.647
Well, <i>quelle surprise.</i>

19:52.650 --> 19:53.650
Okay.

19:56.112 --> 19:57.280
We will see.

19:59.782 --> 20:01.284
Place is incredible.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.955
Photos on the site don't do it justice.

20:08.499 --> 20:10.668
They should hire me to take new pictures.

20:13.421 --> 20:15.715
This is really, really...

20:17.175 --> 20:19.135
really nice.

20:19.219 --> 20:21.679
It must have been very expensive.

20:21.763 --> 20:23.556
Oh, it's fine.

20:23.640 --> 20:26.517
George Lucas has been very,
very good to me.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.103
And to me.

20:29.187 --> 20:31.606
But who knows what the next job will be?

20:31.689 --> 20:32.899
No, I know.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.361
You know,
that's why I want to make this movie.

20:36.444 --> 20:37.779
You know, I don't wanna be a...

20:38.738 --> 20:39.864
cameraman forever.

20:39.948 --> 20:42.575
I need to change
gears before it's too late.

20:44.369 --> 20:45.411
I hope so.

20:48.122 --> 20:49.122
Here.

20:50.708 --> 20:52.752
Hey, I have something for you.

20:55.546 --> 20:57.548
- God.
- Open it.

21:04.555 --> 21:07.308
- You shouldn't have done this.
- You said you liked it.

21:07.392 --> 21:10.436
I know I did, but still...

21:10.520 --> 21:12.438
But still...

21:12.522 --> 21:16.317
I went back to the store in Valencia.
It was still in the window.

21:19.362 --> 21:20.613
You know what I was thinking?

21:21.948 --> 21:23.116
What were you thinking?

21:24.617 --> 21:28.746
I was thinking,
I want us to spend more time together.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.043
Oh, really?

21:34.127 --> 21:35.127
Yeah.

21:36.212 --> 21:41.884
Yeah, I mean, I just had this idea, just
getting rid of the apartment up in the city,

21:41.968 --> 21:45.346
and just moving into
the house in Water Mill...

21:46.097 --> 21:48.057
full-time, making a real home out of it.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.896
All these plans all of a sudden.

21:54.897 --> 21:57.817
Well,
we'd have a beautiful house on the water

21:57.900 --> 22:01.237
and a nice apartment that I'd help
with the rent on in the Upper West Side.

22:01.321 --> 22:03.823
I mean, we'd have two homes.

22:03.906 --> 22:05.908
We don't need anything more than that.

22:05.992 --> 22:06.992
What do you say?

22:09.787 --> 22:13.499
With more time in Water Mill, Ilene,
you could write or paint

22:13.583 --> 22:17.045
or do some of those other
things you always wanna do.

22:17.128 --> 22:20.548
And without my apartment,
we'd both save money.

22:21.966 --> 22:23.718
You wouldn't have to work so hard.

22:28.139 --> 22:29.390
I wanna be with you.

22:30.641 --> 22:31.976
For us to be together.

22:36.647 --> 22:38.107
Is this a proposal?

22:42.612 --> 22:44.530
I don't know, I hadn't really...

22:45.907 --> 22:47.367
thought about it. I guess...

22:47.450 --> 22:48.701
I guess it is.

22:51.788 --> 22:52.788
What do you say?

22:59.253 --> 23:00.755
I say...

23:00.838 --> 23:02.173
I say...

23:03.132 --> 23:04.926
Let's go out.

23:05.009 --> 23:07.470
Let's go out. Let's see where we are.

23:07.553 --> 23:10.431
We just got here. I love this ring.

23:10.515 --> 23:13.226
I love it so much, Gary, and I...

23:14.268 --> 23:15.268
Let's just...

23:15.937 --> 23:18.648
Let's get your camera, get your jacket.

23:18.731 --> 23:22.318
Let's see where we are
before we plan the future.

23:23.986 --> 23:24.986
Okay.

23:27.448 --> 23:28.699
Love this ring.

24:00.273 --> 24:02.984
I'm sorry, I don't speak...

24:03.067 --> 24:05.570
Yes, you do. You speak very well.

24:06.279 --> 24:08.030
I don't speak Portuguese.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.700
Oh, I see. That's okay.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.034
What are you writing?

24:12.118 --> 24:13.744
Oh, it's nothing.

24:13.828 --> 24:16.080
- Are you going to the beach?
- I am.

24:16.164 --> 24:17.915
I take it this is the right direction?

24:19.959 --> 24:21.294
Where are you from?

24:21.377 --> 24:23.754
I'm from England, in the East Midlands.

24:23.838 --> 24:26.924
My family moved to London last year. You?

24:27.008 --> 24:29.510
I'm from Porto, a few hours to the north.

24:29.594 --> 24:33.347
- Bento here is from Sintra.
- Yeah, I live in Sintra.

24:33.431 --> 24:36.392
- You here on vacation?
- Sort of.

24:37.894 --> 24:41.397
- Hey, can I rent a boogie board on the beach?
- No.

24:41.481 --> 24:42.732
But you can use mine.

24:44.567 --> 24:46.027
No, that's okay.

24:46.110 --> 24:49.322
It's fine. Bento has one
too. We can take turns.

24:49.405 --> 24:52.492
- Have you ever been to Praia das MaÃ§Ã£s?
- Never.

24:52.575 --> 24:55.661
Oh, you're going to love it.
I can't wait for you to see it.

24:55.745 --> 24:57.538
It's the most beautiful beach.

24:57.622 --> 25:01.209
<i>"Praia das MaÃ§Ã£s, "</i> Beach of the Apples.

25:01.292 --> 25:04.128
- Are there a lot of apple trees there?
- None.

25:04.212 --> 25:08.382
I think it's called the Apple Beach because
of the apple in the Bible, you know?

25:08.466 --> 25:09.466
No.

25:10.176 --> 25:13.429
In paradise,
the temptation? The original sin?

25:13.513 --> 25:15.515
- The Adam and Eve apple.
- Yes.

25:15.598 --> 25:16.682
That's insane.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.936
We are a very Catholic country, you know.

25:29.946 --> 25:31.572
You're excited about New York?

25:33.157 --> 25:35.201
I'm happy to be going there.

25:35.284 --> 25:36.911
I'm not excited.

25:36.994 --> 25:39.413
I can't be excited about
anything at the moment.

25:40.331 --> 25:41.999
Did you get the sublet?

25:42.083 --> 25:43.709
I haven't sent the documents yet.

25:44.877 --> 25:49.465
There's no better way to remedy an overwhelming
situation than having to fill out paperwork.

25:52.093 --> 25:54.554
Did you call that number I gave you,
the tax lawyer?

25:54.637 --> 25:57.139
Yes, I called him. What an arrogant guy.

25:57.223 --> 26:01.185
He says I should try to convince my mother
to incorporate with me and your dad.

26:03.145 --> 26:05.189
I'll talk to Dad. You
should talk to Frankie.

26:05.273 --> 26:07.900
No, that is the last subject
I want to bring up with her.

26:09.193 --> 26:12.572
Then you will have to pay
the ridiculous inheritance tax.

26:12.655 --> 26:13.698
You're so...

26:14.949 --> 26:17.535
- Pragmatic?
- That's one word for it.

26:18.828 --> 26:20.246
It's just life, Paul.

26:21.581 --> 26:23.165
I don't make as much money as you do,

26:23.249 --> 26:26.002
and when you have a teenage daughter,
you get practical.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.085
Maybe.

26:36.637 --> 26:37.888
I'm gonna leave Ian.

26:39.974 --> 26:43.060
- How many times have you said that?
- It's for real this time.

26:44.645 --> 26:46.063
I can't do it anymore.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.776
Is that why you're
calculating your inheritance?

26:50.860 --> 26:51.944
Stop it.

26:52.028 --> 26:56.532
It's just I've been hearing you say this for
so long, the timing is really interesting.

26:56.616 --> 26:59.076
You are so fucking self-righteous.

27:00.536 --> 27:03.372
- Come to New York.
- Oh, why would I come to New York?

27:03.456 --> 27:05.166
New life, new city.

27:05.249 --> 27:06.751
Well, it's not that easy.

27:08.586 --> 27:09.586
No, it's not.

27:25.436 --> 27:27.855
Tiago was telling us
the story of Saint Eufemia.

27:28.939 --> 27:30.816
What a beautiful church.

27:33.069 --> 27:34.320
So simple.

27:35.613 --> 27:36.613
Told you.

27:37.448 --> 27:39.867
- Bonjour, Tiago.
- Bonjour, <i>Se? Ora.</i>

27:39.950 --> 27:44.497
- I was telling him that during the time of the barbarians...
- It's okay, Tiago.

27:44.664 --> 27:47.124
The beautiful princess names Eufemia

27:47.208 --> 27:50.044
fell in love with a commoner,

27:50.127 --> 27:51.962
but her father the king forbade it.

27:52.046 --> 27:53.839
And the young man fell gravely ill.

27:54.048 --> 27:55.883
Just keep going, Tiago.

27:55.966 --> 27:58.678
Yeah, so the disease
spread all over the boy's body.

27:58.761 --> 28:02.515
His whole skin was full of horrible,
bloody sores.

28:02.598 --> 28:05.685
So the princess went to see the boy
against her father's orders,

28:05.768 --> 28:08.646
and she brought him here,
where they used to come to see the view.

28:09.522 --> 28:11.774
And she washed him in the
waters from the fountain...

28:11.857 --> 28:15.111
And his skin went back
to normal immediately.

28:15.194 --> 28:18.823
Well, not immediately. He felt
better slowly. It took him a few days.

28:18.906 --> 28:21.784
It was the legs first, then the arms,

28:21.867 --> 28:24.203
then the face, then his whole body.

28:24.286 --> 28:26.038
It was considered a miracle.

28:27.164 --> 28:30.918
And people still come here to wash
themselves in this miraculous water?

28:31.001 --> 28:35.673
Yeah, they do, because the water
is said to cure people of all maladies.

28:35.756 --> 28:37.299
Where is the fountain?

28:37.383 --> 28:40.761
It's down there,
but it's not easy to find because it's...

28:40.845 --> 28:42.346
Frankie, please.

28:42.972 --> 28:43.806
Please!

28:43.889 --> 28:45.433
Stop this nonsense, Michel.

28:45.516 --> 28:47.935
Three drops of water won't hurt you.

28:48.018 --> 28:49.812
I don't believe in this bullshit.

28:49.895 --> 28:51.689
Don't say that. It is not bullshit.

28:51.772 --> 28:55.025
Please, stop.
You look like you're at a funeral.

28:55.735 --> 28:57.403
I get that from Jimmy. Look!

28:59.989 --> 29:01.574
I can't take it anymore.

29:04.118 --> 29:06.162
Be more gentle, Frankie.

29:06.245 --> 29:07.955
This is not about you.

29:08.956 --> 29:09.956
Really?

29:25.931 --> 29:28.142
I'm going to ask you both a favor.

29:29.727 --> 29:32.688
At least to pretend
that you accept my fate.

29:34.482 --> 29:36.066
For the sake of this trip.

29:37.985 --> 29:38.985
For today.

29:40.112 --> 29:41.280
For the family.

29:46.202 --> 29:47.202
Please?

31:33.434 --> 31:35.352
You don't really believe in all this,
do you?

31:37.313 --> 31:38.522
I don't know, <i>Se? or.</i>

31:39.481 --> 31:41.025
Whatever helps can't hurt you.

31:42.610 --> 31:44.486
I guess that's right.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.447
- You want one?
- No, thanks.

31:49.408 --> 31:52.369
- Are you married, Tiago?
- Yeah, I am, <i>Se? or.</i>

31:52.453 --> 31:54.413
I have a wife and a son.

31:54.496 --> 31:56.457
They live in the north, in Braga.

31:57.917 --> 31:59.460
Aye. I see.

31:59.543 --> 32:00.628
Are you separated, then?

32:00.711 --> 32:03.047
No, no. Just for five months a year.

32:03.130 --> 32:05.215
I come down here for the tourist season.

32:07.843 --> 32:09.428
I'd imagine that can be difficult.

32:14.850 --> 32:17.561
To be honest with you,
it is. It's quite hard.

32:19.229 --> 32:20.981
My wife, she's...

32:22.316 --> 32:23.859
She's like my police.

32:26.820 --> 32:28.697
I love her very much,

32:28.781 --> 32:31.492
but she doesn't even like me
sitting next to another woman.

32:31.575 --> 32:34.495
So you can imagine what
it's like when I'm here in Sintra.

32:36.413 --> 32:38.874
That's why I look so tired today.

32:38.958 --> 32:42.586
I went out to have dinner with a friend
last night, another tour guide...

32:43.712 --> 32:47.257
and when I called my wife to tell her,
"I love you, good night,"

32:47.341 --> 32:51.053
she already knew where I'd been, what I
drank and who else was at the restaurant.

32:51.136 --> 32:52.680
You can't imagine how it's like.

32:54.264 --> 32:56.558
- Yeah.
- It's incredible.

32:58.894 --> 33:03.148
We stayed up for hours on the phone,
and it's not good for my business.

33:03.232 --> 33:04.608
I have to stay alert.

33:06.443 --> 33:09.530
- The days are not short, you know?
- Yeah.

33:11.782 --> 33:14.159
Sometimes,
I don't even know why I stay married.

33:19.790 --> 33:21.583
I'm sorry, <i>Se? or,</i> it's...

33:21.667 --> 33:24.211
It's not to bother you. It's all good.

33:25.462 --> 33:28.674
I should go see about your friend now,
make sure we didn't lose him.

33:28.757 --> 33:30.843
This is not really a place for tourists,

33:30.926 --> 33:34.013
and it's quite hard to find the place
of the miraculous waters.

33:47.109 --> 33:49.611
- You're walking so fast.
- That's my normal.

33:52.072 --> 33:53.574
We're not in the city, you know.

33:57.953 --> 33:59.955
I think you're trying to get away from me.

34:01.498 --> 34:02.498
Hey.

34:03.792 --> 34:04.918
Listen to me.

34:08.213 --> 34:09.590
I want change.

34:09.672 --> 34:14.136
I don't want to just continue on
like this is all gonna last forever.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.013
You know, I wanna start something new.

34:18.891 --> 34:20.851
You just have to make your movie.

34:20.934 --> 34:22.268
No, no, that's...

34:22.351 --> 34:24.021
That's not it.

34:24.103 --> 34:26.440
You know, maybe I will, maybe I won't,

34:26.523 --> 34:28.900
but I'm ready to settle down.

34:28.984 --> 34:30.194
You know, and I love you.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.821
I love being with you.

34:34.447 --> 34:37.951
Which is why this house in Water Mill
could be the answer.

34:39.536 --> 34:40.536
You know?

34:43.998 --> 34:47.252
I could convert that
garage into a studio for me.

34:47.335 --> 34:51.507
You could have that second
bedroom all to yourself.

34:51.590 --> 34:54.467
I'd knock before entering, I promise.

34:54.551 --> 34:55.552
What do you say?

35:00.933 --> 35:01.933
Ilene?

35:11.568 --> 35:12.569
Ilene!

36:03.453 --> 36:05.372
Sister Aline.

36:05.455 --> 36:07.541
- FranÃ§oise CrÃ©mont.
- Madame CrÃ©mont!

36:09.793 --> 36:11.628
Madame CrÃ©mont.

36:11.712 --> 36:14.882
Oh, Madame CrÃ©mont.

36:16.758 --> 36:18.635
I'm a big fan.

36:18.719 --> 36:22.097
Oh, you must have good taste in movies.

36:22.181 --> 36:25.809
I know you from TV, <i>Arquivos do Vaticano.</i>

36:25.893 --> 36:27.352
<i>The Vatican Files.</i>

36:29.438 --> 36:31.523
Do you want to come with us?

36:32.482 --> 36:34.443
It's my sister's birthday,

36:34.526 --> 36:39.573
so she will be delighted if
you take a toast with her.

36:40.782 --> 36:41.782
Please.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.913
- Okay.
- Thank you. <i>Merci.</i>

36:46.830 --> 36:52.377
She identifies really with
the character of Sister Aline.

36:56.465 --> 37:01.470
Just as the sun rises every morning
and the night comes at the end of the day,

37:01.553 --> 37:05.974
I was certain that Frankie and I
were going to be together forever.

37:06.058 --> 37:10.312
So when one day she
told me she was leaving,

37:10.395 --> 37:13.232
I wondered, how is it possible?

37:15.859 --> 37:18.570
When we got married,
I believed in those vows.

37:18.654 --> 37:22.074
"Till death do us part," and all of that.

37:22.157 --> 37:23.784
You always were a good Catholic.

37:25.494 --> 37:30.332
You know, until today, I hadn't
been inside a church in a long time.

37:30.415 --> 37:33.877
But yes,
I was raised in a very Catholic family.

37:37.673 --> 37:40.968
Frankie and I were so young,

37:41.051 --> 37:42.844
and I was scared.

37:42.928 --> 37:46.181
I didn't know if anything
was going to work out,

37:46.265 --> 37:49.685
the restaurant,
my relationship to my own family, Frankie.

37:50.978 --> 37:52.854
It's hard to remember now.

37:54.356 --> 37:57.442
I remember mostly the fun,
exciting parts...

37:58.610 --> 38:02.489
But it was so scary to be young, no?

38:02.572 --> 38:03.740
Oh, yeah.

38:05.742 --> 38:08.370
You never met my father, did you?

38:08.453 --> 38:10.247
I don't think so.

38:10.330 --> 38:12.124
He was tough.

38:12.207 --> 38:14.042
He was in the Resistance, you know.

38:14.126 --> 38:16.878
A real hero and a real Catholic.

38:18.171 --> 38:21.550
Marriage, for me, was a lifesaver.

38:22.759 --> 38:25.595
I couldn't even imagine
my life without Frankie.

38:25.679 --> 38:27.264
But yet, today,

38:27.347 --> 38:31.852
I know that her leaving was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

38:31.935 --> 38:33.145
I met Thierry.

38:34.354 --> 38:38.317
And I finally allowed myself
to fall in love with a man.

38:43.530 --> 38:45.866
I remember the day
you called to tell Frankie.

38:47.701 --> 38:50.579
Frankie acted so shocked.

38:50.662 --> 38:52.998
I almost gave her an Oscar.

38:53.081 --> 38:54.875
No, it wasn't a performance.

38:54.958 --> 38:57.669
- Oh, please. Please.
- Well, I was there.

38:57.753 --> 39:00.297
- She should have known.
- But she didn't.

39:00.380 --> 39:04.926
Amazing how people sometimes choose
not to see what is right in front of them.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.970
She told me she never knew,

39:07.054 --> 39:09.765
which means that your performance
must have been very convincing.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.141
You should have got the Oscar.

39:20.442 --> 39:24.071
This is the Capela Manuelina.

39:25.197 --> 39:29.326
It was built by Jeronimo
monks in the 16th century.

39:29.409 --> 39:33.497
- It was a sacred place for meditation and reclusion.
- Just a minute, my dear.

39:33.580 --> 39:34.580
Jimmy.

39:39.211 --> 39:42.547
After Frankie, things might change.

39:42.631 --> 39:43.631
Please.

39:44.841 --> 39:46.385
After her,

39:46.468 --> 39:49.763
if there's somebody,
and I hope there will be...

39:49.846 --> 39:51.598
Michel.

39:51.681 --> 39:54.142
Life takes a turn, you know.

39:54.226 --> 39:55.769
Things change.

39:59.606 --> 40:02.359
I don't know what "after Frankie" means.

40:05.153 --> 40:07.155
There's no "after Frankie" for me.

40:12.202 --> 40:15.122
I saw your photo in the magazine.

40:15.956 --> 40:18.333
The one they took in the hospital,
you know.

40:18.417 --> 40:19.876
Do you remember?

40:22.421 --> 40:23.463
The photo

40:23.547 --> 40:24.756
that they took.

40:24.840 --> 40:25.966
It's great.

40:26.383 --> 40:31.012
You fought like a lioness, madam.

40:31.596 --> 40:32.596
It's true.

40:33.682 --> 40:36.726
My best friend
went through the same thing.

40:39.312 --> 40:43.275
She was a quite extraordinary woman.

40:43.358 --> 40:45.902
So strong, just magnificent.

40:45.986 --> 40:46.986
But...

40:47.612 --> 40:49.406
all the same, I lost her.

40:50.782 --> 40:51.658
But you.

40:51.741 --> 40:53.118
You won.

40:53.201 --> 40:54.453
Here you are.

40:56.371 --> 40:58.331
You are a fearless woman.

41:38.288 --> 41:40.540
To you, Fran? Oise CrÃ©mont.

41:40.624 --> 41:43.293
You have made my birthday

41:43.376 --> 41:46.338
for my 88th year

41:46.421 --> 41:47.839
even more beautiful.

44:01.931 --> 44:04.809
Oh, wait. I think it's the other one.

44:04.893 --> 44:07.062
- What are you talking about?
- Your coffee.

44:07.145 --> 44:09.564
- No, mine's a cappuccino.
- Yeah, mine's with skim milk.

44:13.985 --> 44:15.528
- No, wait.
- Ian.

44:15.612 --> 44:17.280
I'm confused.

44:17.364 --> 44:18.907
For God's sake, sweetheart.

44:18.990 --> 44:21.576
You've just run four miles.
A little fat won't kill you.

44:27.290 --> 44:28.625
Another letting agent?

44:31.503 --> 44:33.880
Look for it, Ian, and you shall find it.

44:40.303 --> 44:41.554
Don't be such an ass.

44:43.014 --> 44:43.848
Maya told me.

44:43.932 --> 44:46.601
- She told you what?
- She told me.

44:46.685 --> 44:48.687
You don't have to hide it from me, Sylvia.

44:48.770 --> 44:51.398
I don't know what she told
you. There's nothing to tell.

44:51.481 --> 44:54.359
Look, why would you ask her, anyway?

44:54.442 --> 44:56.319
Why would you involve her?

44:57.946 --> 45:00.657
It's not some Machiavellian
scheme. I'm just looking.

45:00.740 --> 45:02.617
Which means that you're thinking.

45:05.829 --> 45:07.247
You can't be that surprised.

45:09.040 --> 45:10.291
I'm not surprised.

45:11.668 --> 45:12.919
I'm actually sad.

45:14.462 --> 45:17.173
What we're going through,
I think it's normal.

45:18.550 --> 45:19.884
I don't want normal.

45:56.838 --> 45:58.506
Frankie?

45:58.590 --> 45:59.590
Hello.

46:00.717 --> 46:04.179
Frankie, bonjour. Fran? Oise.

46:04.262 --> 46:05.847
I'm Gary.

46:05.930 --> 46:08.808
I'm with Ilene. We arrived this morning.

46:08.892 --> 46:11.144
- You're the friend.
- Oh, she told you about me?

46:11.227 --> 46:12.937
No, no, she didn't. My husband did.

46:13.021 --> 46:15.148
I guess you met him earlier.

46:15.231 --> 46:18.359
It's such a pleasure to meet you.

46:18.443 --> 46:21.029
Ilene and I are working
together on <i>Star Wars.</i>

46:21.112 --> 46:23.406
I'm the second unit DP.

46:23.490 --> 46:25.700
Wow, that must be a lot of work.

46:25.784 --> 46:29.120
I'm tired. Thankful for the break.

46:30.580 --> 46:31.873
First time in Sintra?

46:31.956 --> 46:34.209
First time in Portugal. Yeah.

46:34.292 --> 46:35.668
We've been shooting for a month,

46:35.752 --> 46:38.546
and when Ilene told me you were here,
I said, "Let's go."

46:38.630 --> 46:41.466
I'm a big fan, you know.

46:41.549 --> 46:43.176
I'm a big fan of Ilene's.

46:43.259 --> 46:44.803
- She's been a good friend.
- Yeah.

46:44.886 --> 46:47.889
She and I met on another
movie we did together, <i>The Void.</i>

46:47.972 --> 46:52.393
I was the principal DP on that.
Been hanging out, you know?

46:53.520 --> 46:55.605
I'm not sure what that means.

46:55.688 --> 46:57.482
I love Ilene.

46:59.108 --> 47:02.570
- Yeah, yeah. That's something.
- Yeah.

47:02.654 --> 47:04.113
Frankie, Ilene says...

47:04.197 --> 47:06.032
May I call you "Frankie"?

47:06.115 --> 47:07.992
That's what my friends call me.

47:10.912 --> 47:14.707
You know,
you actually look even better in person.

47:14.791 --> 47:18.461
- You're being kind.
- No, no, it's true. It's true.

47:18.545 --> 47:23.132
I have something that I wanted to talk to
you about if we can ever find a good time.

47:23.216 --> 47:26.427
I have a film project I want to direct.

47:26.511 --> 47:28.263
Your first time directing?

47:28.346 --> 47:32.016
Yeah. Well, no, my first feature.

47:32.100 --> 47:35.395
But I thought about it for a long time.

47:35.478 --> 47:40.817
And I've shot over 18
movies for other people.

47:40.900 --> 47:42.735
I think I'm ready, you know?

47:42.819 --> 47:46.072
And I think you and I
would share a similar...

47:46.155 --> 47:48.074
taste in a certain kind of cinema.

47:49.200 --> 47:52.328
It's about an opera
singer that loses her voice.

47:53.496 --> 47:55.415
- That's funny.
- Yeah.

47:55.498 --> 47:57.333
I think you'd be perfect for it.

47:57.417 --> 47:58.626
I can't sing.

48:00.461 --> 48:03.089
That's just it. She's lost her voice.

48:03.172 --> 48:06.342
You know, it's like a silent film acting.

48:06.426 --> 48:09.470
I can't think of anybody
more expressive for the role.

48:09.554 --> 48:11.055
Like Greta Garbo.

48:12.181 --> 48:13.766
Or Fatty Arbuckle.

48:17.395 --> 48:18.938
Can I send it to you?

48:19.022 --> 48:20.315
If you'd like.

48:20.398 --> 48:23.109
When are you thinking of shooting this?

48:23.192 --> 48:25.612
Well, it won't happen now.

48:25.695 --> 48:30.450
It'll take at least a year to prepare.
You know the business.

48:32.410 --> 48:33.494
I see.

48:34.787 --> 48:35.955
You know...

48:36.039 --> 48:40.668
Frankie, I'm gonna take time
off in order to work on this film,

48:40.752 --> 48:46.049
and I have a house in Water Mill, about a
little under two hours outside of the city.

48:46.132 --> 48:47.258
Beautiful place.

48:47.342 --> 48:50.970
And I've asked Ilene to come live with me.

48:52.221 --> 48:54.724
Don't you think it would
be a good idea for her to...

48:55.767 --> 48:58.937
settle down, not travel so much,

48:59.020 --> 49:02.607
not be so distracted with projects
she doesn't really care about?

49:04.692 --> 49:06.444
Does it matter what I think?

49:07.946 --> 49:10.448
Well, you know her well.

49:12.784 --> 49:14.786
Yes, but does it matter?

49:14.869 --> 49:17.997
You've invited her,
so then you should know.

49:19.999 --> 49:22.710
Ilene is the kind of woman
who'll tell you straight to your face

49:22.794 --> 49:24.671
what she thinks.

49:24.754 --> 49:26.673
No bullshit, Ilene.

49:27.840 --> 49:29.384
And no bullshitters.

49:31.844 --> 49:37.016
She doesn't have time for people
who are not very real, very sincere.

49:37.100 --> 49:38.434
That's why I like her.

49:42.063 --> 49:44.107
This rain is going to stop soon.

49:44.190 --> 49:46.693
If you'll excuse me,
I'll go look for my son.

49:46.776 --> 49:52.615
I haven't seen him since the morning,
and this was meant to be a family vacation.

49:54.158 --> 49:55.535
See you later. Bye.

50:28.234 --> 50:30.403
I hardly slept last night.

50:31.571 --> 50:32.822
Your migraines again?

50:33.448 --> 50:35.408
Awful. Getting worse and worse.

50:36.826 --> 50:38.703
- Take your pills.
- I do.

50:40.038 --> 50:41.247
Increase the dose.

50:43.332 --> 50:46.419
I'll go to Dr. Bernhard.
It doesn't work that way.

50:47.211 --> 50:49.005
I already take a lot.

50:49.088 --> 50:50.798
So what, at this stage?

50:55.803 --> 50:59.015
- Sorry. I apologize.
- No, don't apologize.

50:59.098 --> 51:00.850
I don't want you to suffer.

51:01.267 --> 51:04.145
You're right. At this stage, who cares?

51:04.771 --> 51:06.939
Anyway, you seem in great shape.

51:07.607 --> 51:08.649
Here.

51:14.280 --> 51:15.823
I want you to have it.

51:16.532 --> 51:17.532
Why?

51:18.451 --> 51:21.204
It's worth at least 40,000 euros.

51:22.246 --> 51:24.832
If I give it to you now, you pay no tax.

51:25.708 --> 51:27.710
Put it somewhere safe.

51:27.794 --> 51:29.754
Then in a couple of years...

51:31.172 --> 51:33.966
It's yours. No one will ever know.

51:34.050 --> 51:35.301
I don't want it.

51:36.385 --> 51:38.429
Maybe your future wife will like it.

51:38.513 --> 51:41.015
How about I start with a girlfriend?

51:42.058 --> 51:44.602
Life in New York is very expensive,
you know.

51:46.312 --> 51:48.856
I'll have a very good job, as I told you.

51:49.816 --> 51:51.692
Guess what? I earn a lot.

51:51.776 --> 51:53.986
Yes, I know, and I disapprove.

51:54.070 --> 51:56.614
Your approval makes no difference to me.

51:56.697 --> 51:58.282
Here, take it.

52:05.414 --> 52:07.333
Another thing we need to discuss

52:07.416 --> 52:10.336
is this trust idea that Sylvia mentioned.

52:10.837 --> 52:11.837
Yes?

52:13.214 --> 52:14.632
Money is your field.

52:16.050 --> 52:17.552
What is it exactly?

52:18.761 --> 52:20.513
We need to ask a lawyer.

52:21.055 --> 52:22.890
A specialist in these issues.

52:22.974 --> 52:24.433
You don't jump into it.

52:24.517 --> 52:26.978
Let's not talk inheritance tax perhaps.

52:27.061 --> 52:29.355
The vacation is to get away from that.

52:29.438 --> 52:31.190
In my case, it's simple.

52:31.274 --> 52:33.484
All I have is the Paris apartment.

52:34.610 --> 52:36.279
I've put it on the market.

52:37.822 --> 52:40.825
I'll bequeath the proceeds
to the Conservatory.

52:43.161 --> 52:44.161
What?

52:45.371 --> 52:46.789
You're giving it away?

52:50.668 --> 52:51.836
Does Jimmy know?

52:52.753 --> 52:54.046
Yes, of course.

52:57.508 --> 52:58.968
You don't need me.

52:59.051 --> 53:00.970
You've made that abundantly clear.

53:03.639 --> 53:05.600
And Jimmy has done well.

53:06.225 --> 53:08.060
His savings cover all his needs.

53:10.229 --> 53:11.814
Sylvia can count on Ian.

53:11.898 --> 53:14.150
I bet he makes even more than you.

53:14.233 --> 53:15.233
No doubt.

53:16.444 --> 53:17.820
I'm not complaining, Mom.

53:18.654 --> 53:20.573
I have no wish to live in Paris.

53:20.656 --> 53:23.826
If you want to donate the apartment, do it.

53:24.410 --> 53:25.620
I'm just surprised.

53:28.623 --> 53:31.042
How much is it worth? A lot?

53:31.834 --> 53:33.836
Three million, in our neighborhood.

53:33.920 --> 53:35.588
You must be wrong.

53:35.671 --> 53:37.715
Don't belittle me, Paul.

53:37.798 --> 53:39.175
There's no need for it.

53:43.512 --> 53:46.057
The Conservatory has promised to set up

53:46.557 --> 53:47.683
a scholarship.

53:49.435 --> 53:51.646
The Fran? Oise CrÃ©mont Scholarship

53:51.729 --> 53:53.231
to aid young actors.

53:54.273 --> 53:55.524
I see.

53:55.608 --> 53:58.110
Yes, it's vanity, but that's how it is.

53:58.194 --> 54:00.780
It's what I want, so I'm making it happen.

54:04.909 --> 54:06.702
But it must be done properly.

54:08.329 --> 54:09.872
Can you make sure of that?

54:09.956 --> 54:10.956
What?

54:11.332 --> 54:13.542
That they set up the scholarship!

54:14.543 --> 54:16.963
Come on, you make them sound like crooks.

54:24.095 --> 54:25.429
Have you seen Ilene?

54:26.514 --> 54:29.058
My friend Ilene who arrived this morning.

54:29.183 --> 54:32.186
- The one you keep talking about?
- My hairstylist friend.

54:32.311 --> 54:35.356
She's really talented and so smart.

54:35.773 --> 54:37.191
She makes me laugh.

54:37.984 --> 54:39.735
I'm sure you'd like her.

54:39.819 --> 54:41.153
She lives in New York?

54:42.029 --> 54:43.072
She's single?

54:44.824 --> 54:46.284
That I don't know.

54:46.951 --> 54:48.619
You'll see, she's very pretty.

54:50.329 --> 54:52.832
And just happens to be in Sintra
when we are.

54:52.915 --> 54:54.875
She's working in Spain right next door.

54:55.876 --> 54:57.878
Wasn't this meant to be a family vacation?

54:57.962 --> 55:01.215
But she's on the new <i>Star Wars.</i>
It's wonderful for her.

55:02.466 --> 55:04.260
Shows you how good she is.

55:04.885 --> 55:08.431
It's funny. Most mothers think
no one's good enough for their sons.

55:08.514 --> 55:11.726
I don't know which mothers you mean.
Not mine for sure.

55:11.809 --> 55:14.770
As long as he wasn't Jewish
and he was a man,

55:15.479 --> 55:16.939
that was just fine by her.

55:19.900 --> 55:22.153
It was fine even if he was homosexual.

55:25.072 --> 55:26.198
Paul,

55:26.282 --> 55:28.951
all your life, I've given you
everything you wanted,

55:29.035 --> 55:31.120
and you are never content.

55:31.203 --> 55:32.955
Nothing is ever enough for you.

55:33.748 --> 55:35.958
Not any one woman, nor man.

55:36.500 --> 55:38.044
Not your mother, nor your father.

55:39.545 --> 55:41.881
You're crazy! What are you doing?

55:41.964 --> 55:43.424
I don't believe it.

56:06.238 --> 56:07.823
Is that still Sintra?

56:07.907 --> 56:10.284
No, that is the town of Praia das MaÃ§Ã£s.

56:10.368 --> 56:11.577
Just like the beach.

56:12.745 --> 56:14.413
It's so pretty.

56:14.497 --> 56:16.457
I knew you'd love it.

56:16.540 --> 56:18.459
If you want, I can buy you a postcard.

56:20.628 --> 56:23.506
My whole life, I would come here
with my parents and my sister.

56:23.589 --> 56:25.716
Every summer until I was 12.

56:25.800 --> 56:27.051
And then what happened?

56:27.134 --> 56:29.011
Then my parents got divorced,

56:29.095 --> 56:33.474
and my vacation time had to be divided
between time with Mom and time with Dad.

56:34.725 --> 56:37.144
So there was no time for
this Apple Beach anymore.

56:38.437 --> 56:40.689
But then I met Bento in Lisbon last year.

56:40.773 --> 56:43.484
We played football against each other
in a national tournament.

56:43.567 --> 56:45.986
His school won,
but we became friends after.

56:46.070 --> 56:48.197
And he invited me to visit him in Sintra.

56:51.242 --> 56:55.955
Whenever I come,
he and his friends bring me back here.

56:56.038 --> 56:57.873
They know how much I love this place.

57:13.180 --> 57:17.268
One time, we were here,
before my parents got divorced.

57:19.228 --> 57:21.814
And I remember my father
took an apple from his bag.

57:21.897 --> 57:23.983
And before he offered it to my mom,

57:24.066 --> 57:28.154
he made a joke about this being the beach
where Adam tempted Eve with the apple.

57:28.237 --> 57:29.613
The sun was setting,

57:29.697 --> 57:33.075
and just the sound of the waves
breaking in the white sand...

57:33.159 --> 57:34.785
How could she resist?

57:34.869 --> 57:35.995
How could any girl?

58:22.958 --> 58:27.004
What did you lose now, Frankie, darling?

58:27.087 --> 58:32.426
If you stumble upon a very expensive
Italian bracelet, it's mine.

58:32.510 --> 58:34.428
Seriously?

58:34.512 --> 58:37.056
Gold, and lots and lots of diamonds.

58:37.139 --> 58:38.766
- You're joking.
- I'm not.

58:40.518 --> 58:43.312
What...? What happened?

58:43.395 --> 58:45.231
My stupid son.

58:47.358 --> 58:48.776
It's the only one I have.

58:52.363 --> 58:53.489
Help me up here.

58:56.075 --> 58:59.245
Oh, Ilene, it's so good to see you.

58:59.328 --> 59:02.039
- Good to see you.
- My darling.

59:06.418 --> 59:08.462
- Frankie?
- I'm okay.

59:10.631 --> 59:11.799
Oh, help me.

59:12.967 --> 59:14.301
Frankie?

59:36.532 --> 59:38.409
- You're not gonna eat?
- No, I'm not hungry.

59:38.492 --> 59:40.494
Oh, excuse me.

59:40.578 --> 59:43.455
Can I have a glass of Planalto, por favor?

59:54.300 --> 59:56.844
Regardless of what I feel...

59:56.927 --> 59:58.596
and what I think you're feeling...

01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:05.436
you've got a home and an amazing daughter,
and...

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.024
Maybe it's my personality.

01:00:11.442 --> 01:00:12.442
I don't know.

01:00:14.445 --> 01:00:16.488
I didn't grow up like you.

01:00:16.572 --> 01:00:17.656
All of you.

01:00:20.284 --> 01:00:23.829
Of course, I can fantasize once in a while
about what my life would be like if...

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:25.914
If I made different choices.

01:00:25.998 --> 01:00:26.999
It's normal.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.500
It's human.

01:00:32.171 --> 01:00:34.590
But actually going through a divorce?

01:00:38.093 --> 01:00:39.511
That hasn't crossed my mind.

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:42.180
Never?

01:00:45.851 --> 01:00:46.851
No.

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.607
Well, I can't say the same.

01:00:55.736 --> 01:00:58.572
Then you know there's one ground
for divorce under British law,

01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:03.410
which is the marriage has
irretrievably broken down.

01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:08.040
Five facts constitute this ground:

01:01:08.123 --> 01:01:12.586
adultery, unreasonable behavior,

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:15.339
two years' separation
if both parties consent,

01:01:15.422 --> 01:01:19.009
five years' separation
if one party consents,

01:01:19.093 --> 01:01:21.011
and two years' desertion.

01:01:22.513 --> 01:01:23.513
God.

01:01:24.807 --> 01:01:27.726
- You did more research than I did.
- Of course I did.

01:01:30.562 --> 01:01:32.606
I called a lawyer. What did you expect?

01:01:38.696 --> 01:01:42.991
In the unlikely event
that you are granted a...

01:01:43.075 --> 01:01:45.452
decree absolute,

01:01:45.536 --> 01:01:52.251
since you don't have a salary, your maintenance
would get you, according to our calculations,

01:01:52.334 --> 01:01:56.422
a one-bedroom flat in Upper Edmonton,

01:01:56.505 --> 01:01:59.800
or maybe a two-bedroom, one-bath in...

01:02:01.343 --> 01:02:02.511
Lower Edmonton.

01:02:08.434 --> 01:02:09.518
I'm gonna go.

01:02:11.395 --> 01:02:13.814
You're not gonna pick up Maya with me?

01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:16.024
No, I want to go see the Regaleira.

01:02:17.443 --> 01:02:20.487
What is the Regaleira, may I ask?

01:02:20.571 --> 01:02:22.197
Doesn't matter.

01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:32.166
- Shouldn't we call a doctor?
- No, no.

01:02:34.209 --> 01:02:35.252
I'm fine.

01:02:36.462 --> 01:02:37.462
You sure?

01:02:38.464 --> 01:02:40.591
Yes, I was down on my knees for so long,

01:02:40.674 --> 01:02:45.471
so when I got up,
I just felt faint for a moment.

01:02:45.554 --> 01:02:49.391
Oh, no, no, you didn't just faint, sweetie.
You had a seizure.

01:02:52.144 --> 01:02:54.354
Yeah. You scared me to death.

01:03:02.654 --> 01:03:03.697
I'm sorry.

01:03:07.451 --> 01:03:08.827
You sure you're all right?

01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:15.459
Yeah, just feeling cold. Don't you?

01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:17.169
Let's go back to the hotel.

01:03:21.715 --> 01:03:23.217
It's not far, I think.

01:03:31.725 --> 01:03:33.352
Has this happened before?

01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:39.691
I have one of these every other day now.

01:03:44.863 --> 01:03:46.949
But I thought you were fine.

01:03:47.032 --> 01:03:48.032
I was.

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:54.456
After the treatment, I had two years
completely cancer-free.

01:03:55.707 --> 01:03:56.707
It was...

01:03:58.043 --> 01:03:59.461
great.

01:03:59.545 --> 01:04:02.881
I went back to work,
and I made two films back-to-back.

01:04:04.633 --> 01:04:06.635
One in England, one in France.

01:04:09.471 --> 01:04:11.390
You told me you were exhausted.

01:04:11.473 --> 01:04:13.725
Yes, but only because it was a long shoot.

01:04:16.311 --> 01:04:21.275
The one in Bath,
and we had to be outdoors in the winter.

01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:24.278
It wasn't easy,
but it was wonderful, and I felt fine.

01:04:33.412 --> 01:04:36.582
I don't want to go into all the details,
but...

01:04:36.665 --> 01:04:38.250
the cancer has spread.

01:04:40.294 --> 01:04:41.545
It's everywhere.

01:04:44.673 --> 01:04:46.717
They don't think I'll see the New Year.

01:04:49.595 --> 01:04:50.637
Oh, Frankie.

01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:56.643
The difficult part for me is seeing
people cry, so please don't cry.

01:05:02.316 --> 01:05:05.527
I wanted you to come here
because I want you to meet my family.

01:05:09.573 --> 01:05:13.493
I want us to have a good time, which,
for me now, means just time together.

01:05:17.456 --> 01:05:19.082
I'm going to miss you.

01:05:20.959 --> 01:05:23.211
Terribly.

01:05:23.295 --> 01:05:24.546
I know you will.

01:05:28.383 --> 01:05:30.886
Oh, are you cold? Are you cold? Here.

01:05:30.969 --> 01:05:32.012
I'm okay.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:40.562
Do you have any idea where we are?

01:05:44.858 --> 01:05:47.027
I have no sense of direction.

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:48.987
- I don't know why I trust you.
- I think...

01:05:50.113 --> 01:05:51.531
Let's go this way.

01:06:11.802 --> 01:06:13.387
Let's get it.

01:06:13.804 --> 01:06:14.804
Please!

01:06:16.264 --> 01:06:18.433
He has a lot of plans, this Gary.

01:06:20.727 --> 01:06:23.772
He's a really sweet guy, actually.

01:06:23.855 --> 01:06:25.899
We've had a lot of fun together.

01:06:27.609 --> 01:06:29.236
I think the script will be good.

01:06:31.947 --> 01:06:33.991
- But you...
- He's a lot deeper than he seems.

01:06:35.993 --> 01:06:39.579
But you know he's not the right
one for you, Ilene. You must.

01:06:40.872 --> 01:06:43.875
- Is there a right one for me?
- Of course there is.

01:06:43.959 --> 01:06:46.336
Sometimes I think I've
been looking my whole life.

01:06:50.048 --> 01:06:51.925
"Find it before you look for it."

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:01.393
It's what Jimmy says.

01:07:01.476 --> 01:07:03.687
One of his famous quotes.

01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:04.896
Paul ValÃ©ry.

01:07:07.315 --> 01:07:09.067
Or Breton, I think.

01:07:17.659 --> 01:07:20.245
"Find it before you look for it."

01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:55.780
Ilene?

01:08:06.875 --> 01:08:07.875
Hey.

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:11.046
Hey, honey.

01:08:11.129 --> 01:08:12.506
No, don't worry.

01:08:13.507 --> 01:08:16.676
Don't worry. It's okay.

01:08:17.886 --> 01:08:18.929
It's okay.

01:08:20.096 --> 01:08:21.096
Hey.

01:08:23.517 --> 01:08:25.185
You don't have to say anything.

01:08:27.854 --> 01:08:28.854
Okay?

01:08:44.371 --> 01:08:45.831
When I came here, I wasn't...

01:08:50.919 --> 01:08:54.548
When I came here,
I wasn't expecting so much.

01:08:57.425 --> 01:08:58.425
I know.

01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:01.555
I know. Me neither.

01:09:03.098 --> 01:09:07.477
I don't know if it's the
mountains or the air or what, but...

01:09:11.148 --> 01:09:13.024
I'm gonna leave, Ilene.

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:19.363
- We still have...
- No, no. I know, I know, I know.

01:09:19.447 --> 01:09:22.242
- days off.
- But I'm just gonna go to...

01:09:22.325 --> 01:09:24.286
Lisbon for a night or two.

01:09:24.368 --> 01:09:25.787
It's supposed to be a great town.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.626
I'm really sorry, Gary.

01:09:31.710 --> 01:09:33.170
No, no, no.

01:09:33.252 --> 01:09:34.754
Don't apologize.

01:09:35.755 --> 01:09:36.755
Hey.

01:09:37.883 --> 01:09:39.426
My feelings for you...

01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:43.054
if it's not reciprocal, it's...

01:09:46.308 --> 01:09:50.437
And besides, I understand
how much you value your friends and...

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:51.645
Stay here.

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:55.524
You know?

01:09:58.528 --> 01:10:02.282
But when you shoot your movie,
I'm going to come and work on it.

01:10:08.079 --> 01:10:11.208
I don't know if that's such a good
idea anymore. I hope you understand.

01:10:14.628 --> 01:10:16.463
Oh, yeah. Of course.

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:23.136
I have a car coming.
I'm gonna go pack.

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:34.327
Is Fran? Oise here?

01:13:34.411 --> 01:13:35.620
You must be Ilene.

01:13:35.703 --> 01:13:37.664
- Yes, yes, and you are...?
- Come in.

01:13:37.747 --> 01:13:39.416
- I'm Paul.
- That's what I thought.

01:13:39.499 --> 01:13:41.209
I just came to see
how your mother is.

01:13:41.292 --> 01:13:44.379
- She's resting upstairs.
- That's good. Okay.

01:13:44.462 --> 01:13:46.381
I'm making tea. Do you want some?

01:13:46.464 --> 01:13:49.300
- No. I really just came to just see how she is. I...
- Come, join me.

01:13:53.054 --> 01:13:54.389
What an amazing place.

01:13:54.472 --> 01:13:55.807
It is.

01:13:55.890 --> 01:13:58.351
If you don't mind a few leaks.

01:14:00.228 --> 01:14:01.771
You're moving to New York?

01:14:01.855 --> 01:14:03.356
And you live there, is that right?

01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:06.067
Twenty-three years.

01:14:07.318 --> 01:14:10.029
Do you know where in the city
you'll be living?

01:14:10.113 --> 01:14:11.113
Oh, I don't know.

01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:15.034
I thought your mother told me
you'd found a place already.

01:14:15.118 --> 01:14:16.828
My mother thinks
she knows everything.

01:14:16.911 --> 01:14:18.621
She has all these plans, you know.

01:14:18.705 --> 01:14:20.373
Oh, of course.

01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:22.459
She's in a hurry.

01:14:26.421 --> 01:14:27.922
So you know?

01:14:28.006 --> 01:14:30.258
Yes. I'm sorry.

01:14:30.341 --> 01:14:31.718
If you ever need anything...

01:14:31.801 --> 01:14:34.220
We'll be fine. Thank you.

01:14:41.269 --> 01:14:42.395
I'm sorry.

01:14:44.939 --> 01:14:47.400
Your mother invited me here, you know.

01:14:47.484 --> 01:14:48.735
I know she did.

01:14:48.818 --> 01:14:50.236
She wanted us to meet.

01:14:51.237 --> 01:14:53.948
She's afraid I'm going to end up alone
in New York City.

01:14:54.032 --> 01:14:56.409
Maybe she just wanted me to be around.

01:14:56.493 --> 01:14:58.244
We're really good friends, you know?

01:14:59.245 --> 01:15:01.122
Can I tell you a story about Frankie?

01:15:02.457 --> 01:15:06.544
I don't think that's necessary,
Paul. I don't...

01:15:06.628 --> 01:15:08.630
But I want you to hear it.

01:15:08.713 --> 01:15:11.591
It will help you to understand
our family a little better.

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:15.386
When my mom first started seeing Jimmy,

01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:19.015
he took us on a trip to the
Algarve. Have you been?

01:15:19.098 --> 01:15:22.560
- Never.
- Praia da FalÃ©sia, beautiful beach.

01:15:22.644 --> 01:15:23.728
South of here.

01:15:23.811 --> 01:15:27.315
Mom,
Jimmy and Sylvia... His daughter Sylvia.

01:15:27.398 --> 01:15:28.900
Have you met Sylvia?

01:15:28.983 --> 01:15:30.193
No, I haven't.

01:15:31.194 --> 01:15:32.195
She's lovely.

01:15:33.404 --> 01:15:35.657
A little damaged, but lovely.

01:15:37.659 --> 01:15:39.786
We all went to the Algarve together.

01:15:39.869 --> 01:15:44.499
Mom had moved to London,
but only for a short time, for a film,

01:15:44.582 --> 01:15:49.963
but clearly, she and Jimmy were also
testing the water for this new family to be.

01:15:51.297 --> 01:15:54.342
A family vacation was decided,
and off we went.

01:15:55.343 --> 01:15:58.346
I barely spoke any English at the time.

01:15:58.429 --> 01:16:01.558
I was just your average French schoolboy.

01:16:01.641 --> 01:16:04.185
So, as you can imagine, I was nervous.

01:16:05.645 --> 01:16:08.022
Excited but nervous.

01:16:08.106 --> 01:16:09.649
Particularly because of Sylvia.

01:16:12.235 --> 01:16:14.445
Really, you might not know it now,

01:16:14.529 --> 01:16:16.698
but she was the most beautiful girl ever.

01:16:17.824 --> 01:16:21.286
She was... She is a
few years older than me.

01:16:21.369 --> 01:16:25.123
I was maybe 15 and she was 18 or 19.

01:16:26.249 --> 01:16:27.249
Sugar?

01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:31.129
She had a woman's body already.

01:16:32.213 --> 01:16:33.423
A beautiful body.

01:16:34.966 --> 01:16:37.844
When I saw her in bikini, my God.

01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:39.095
I was such a boy.

01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:45.393
Anyway...

01:16:45.476 --> 01:16:49.480
it was summer and hot, and she and I would
spend the whole day on the beach together.

01:16:50.898 --> 01:16:52.358
Maybe I don't need to go on.

01:16:52.442 --> 01:16:53.943
You get the picture, right?

01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.740
One night,

01:16:58.823 --> 01:17:00.908
Mom and Jimmy went out to dinner,

01:17:00.992 --> 01:17:05.705
and we said, "Sylvia and I are going
to stay home and watch TV."

01:17:06.914 --> 01:17:08.708
The movie <i>Grease</i> was on.

01:17:08.791 --> 01:17:10.084
Do you remember?

01:17:11.252 --> 01:17:13.463
I don't know what got into me,
because...

01:17:14.547 --> 01:17:16.966
I was actually a very shy boy.

01:17:18.426 --> 01:17:22.055
Pimples and skinny and...

01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:23.306
very uncomfortable.

01:17:24.891 --> 01:17:30.605
But I got up, and I start to imitate
John Travolta and his choreography.

01:17:32.273 --> 01:17:36.861
I grab her so we could dance together,
but she screamed.

01:17:36.944 --> 01:17:41.032
Not because she didn't want to, no.
No, she was sunburned.

01:17:41.115 --> 01:17:44.077
So, naturally, I offered to put some...

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.913
I offered to put some
lotion on her shoulders.

01:17:51.626 --> 01:17:53.044
She took her shirt off.

01:17:56.172 --> 01:17:59.592
When my mom and Jimmy came back,
we are having sex on the couch.

01:18:01.678 --> 01:18:04.555
Me and my soon-to-be stepsister.

01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:08.476
So, as you can imagine,

01:18:10.186 --> 01:18:13.022
it was the end of this new family idea.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:18.319
And I was sent back to live with Michel,
my father, in Paris.

01:18:18.403 --> 01:18:22.532
And my mom moved to London
to live with Jimmy and Sylvia.

01:18:25.618 --> 01:18:26.744
And that was that.

01:18:29.789 --> 01:18:31.207
You see?

01:18:31.290 --> 01:18:34.669
In Portugal,
I had lost my mother once already.

01:18:37.839 --> 01:18:40.383
It only seems fitting
that I'm here again now.

01:18:49.392 --> 01:18:51.102
She's right about one thing, you know.

01:18:52.103 --> 01:18:53.354
You are very attractive.

01:18:56.983 --> 01:18:58.317
Is that a compliment?

01:18:59.861 --> 01:19:00.861
Maybe.

01:19:03.614 --> 01:19:07.034
My mother would like us to get married,
so...

01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:09.912
Do you think you're the marrying type?

01:19:19.630 --> 01:19:20.630
Not to you.

01:19:25.553 --> 01:19:26.721
I didn't think so.

01:21:58.039 --> 01:21:59.415
It's beautiful.

01:22:02.710 --> 01:22:03.794
I'm sorry.

01:22:07.131 --> 01:22:08.131
Don't.

01:22:10.092 --> 01:22:11.469
It's very sad.

01:22:13.137 --> 01:22:14.472
Very sad, indeed.

01:22:30.112 --> 01:22:31.155
Yeah.

01:22:40.289 --> 01:22:41.499
One more?

01:22:41.582 --> 01:22:42.582
No.

01:22:44.126 --> 01:22:46.963
I'm going to go for a walk,
if you don't mind.

01:22:47.046 --> 01:22:48.046
Okay.

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:51.425
I'll meet you all at Peninha.

01:26:33.564 --> 01:26:35.065
How did you find Frankie?

01:26:38.444 --> 01:26:39.737
Beyond recovered.

01:26:41.405 --> 01:26:43.157
She's a star.

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:44.491
I know. It's wonderful.

01:26:45.576 --> 01:26:47.494
And complicated.

01:26:47.578 --> 01:26:49.872
I can imagine.

01:26:49.955 --> 01:26:52.666
You know, people seldom say no to Frankie.

01:26:53.667 --> 01:26:57.713
I know. She must be terribly
disappointed with my visit.

01:26:57.796 --> 01:27:00.257
She didn't expect you
to show up with a boyfriend.

01:27:00.341 --> 01:27:02.009
- Ex-boyfriend.
- Oh?

01:27:02.092 --> 01:27:04.053
As soon as we got here, he proposed.

01:27:05.262 --> 01:27:06.430
And?

01:27:06.513 --> 01:27:09.600
And he's on a train to Lisbon now.

01:27:29.745 --> 01:27:31.163
I've always loved New York.

01:27:32.164 --> 01:27:34.750
Had a real love affair
with it for the longest time,

01:27:34.833 --> 01:27:38.087
but now everything
about it is irritating me.

01:27:38.170 --> 01:27:42.967
Constant noise, the development,
the terrible subways.

01:27:43.968 --> 01:27:46.971
And all my favorite
restaurants are gone or going.

01:27:47.054 --> 01:27:48.472
Oh, not Keens.

01:27:50.015 --> 01:27:52.643
But you can't eat at Keens every night.

01:27:53.852 --> 01:27:54.852
Why not?

01:28:01.151 --> 01:28:03.737
You know, if Gary had proposed
to me when we were in New York,

01:28:03.821 --> 01:28:05.531
I would have answered differently.

01:28:06.657 --> 01:28:09.285
But there's something about being here.

01:28:10.494 --> 01:28:11.494
I don't know.

01:28:12.705 --> 01:28:13.872
Felt strong.

01:28:19.545 --> 01:28:20.587
You know, Jimmy,

01:28:22.464 --> 01:28:24.842
I'm hoping to be in London
before the end of the year.

01:28:24.925 --> 01:28:27.428
There's a job,
and it will be for several months.

01:28:29.179 --> 01:28:31.557
I hope that I can be a help to Frankie.

01:28:33.225 --> 01:28:34.225
And to you.

01:28:35.185 --> 01:28:37.062
When will you be there?

01:28:37.146 --> 01:28:38.063
Soon.

01:28:38.147 --> 01:28:39.982
Just waiting to hear from production.

01:28:40.065 --> 01:28:41.775
Oh, please let me know.

01:28:42.818 --> 01:28:44.069
I'd love to show you around.

01:28:49.783 --> 01:28:51.410
It got cold all of a sudden.

01:28:51.493 --> 01:28:52.493
I know.
