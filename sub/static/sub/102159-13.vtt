20:53.339 --> 20:55.428
- If we're throwing out
options, why not?

20:56.472 --> 20:57.952
- Oh, my gosh.
You're serious?

20:57.995 --> 21:00.389
- Lana, these people have
known us our entire lives.

21:00.433 --> 21:04.045
You know, what's it say about
them if they're just so quick

21:04.088 --> 21:06.352
to turn their backs
on us like that, huh?

21:06.395 --> 21:09.442
- These people,
they're our family.

21:10.356 --> 21:12.532
Look, this will blow over.

21:12.575 --> 21:15.665
- I guess we'll see
about that, huh?

21:18.146 --> 21:20.191
- How'd you find this place?

21:22.237 --> 21:26.981
- I used to come here
with <i>mi abuelita.</i>

21:27.024 --> 21:30.419
She'd tell me stories
about my family.

21:30.463 --> 21:31.899
We're originally from Mexico,

21:31.942 --> 21:36.033
but we've been in Smallville
for generations, so.

21:36.077 --> 21:38.427
You know, half the time
I wouldn't even know

21:38.471 --> 21:39.950
which one of her stories
were true,

21:39.994 --> 21:43.563
But it always just made me feel

21:43.606 --> 21:46.348
like I had somewhere to belong.

21:46.392 --> 21:49.569
- I never really felt
like I belonged anywhere...

21:52.485 --> 21:54.922
To be honest until I met you.

21:54.965 --> 21:56.097
- Jordan--

21:56.140 --> 21:58.012
- I know, I know,
I know, whatever,

21:58.055 --> 22:01.450

is that it only really takes

22:01.494 --> 22:04.235
one person
to change your whole life,

22:04.279 --> 22:06.150
just to make you feel safe.

22:06.194 --> 22:07.456
And you have Jon,

22:07.500 --> 22:09.415
and you have your family,

22:09.458 --> 22:11.591

- Yeah.

22:32.176 --> 22:33.482
- That's enough, you two.

22:37.530 --> 22:40.576
- We've got about two
dozen rifles and handguns,

a few thousand
kryptonite bullets,

22:42.491 --> 22:46.408
give or take in addition

22:46.452 --> 22:49.106

in the R&D lab,

22:51.282 --> 22:52.719
the biochemical weapons?

22:52.762 --> 22:56.418
- Maybe five or so in
varying stages of development.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.551
- And how much raw kryptonite
do you have in your stockpile?

22:58.594 --> 23:01.336
- A couple of warehouses worth.
Why all the questions?

23:01.380 --> 23:03.033
It's all gonna be gone anyway.

23:05.862 --> 23:08.648
- I think it's a mistake.
- What?

23:08.691 --> 23:11.215
- We need 7734.

23:11.259 --> 23:13.043
That's why you authorized it
in the first place.

23:13.087 --> 23:15.916
- And then I saw
how it hurt my family.

23:15.959 --> 23:17.439
These weapons can kill you.

23:17.483 --> 23:19.267

we need them.

23:19.310 --> 23:21.661
- Clark, you're not the enemy.

23:21.704 --> 23:24.272
- Yeah, but I could have been.

23:24.315 --> 23:26.666
Look, Sam, people like me,

23:26.709 --> 23:28.842
without these weapons,

23:28.885 --> 23:30.539
we're indestructible,

this girl, and she's a junior.

26:22.189 --> 26:23.756
And I don't know.
I thought--

26:23.799 --> 26:25.235
I thought she was out
of my league, you know?

26:25.279 --> 26:26.715
- You skipped class
to impress a girl?

26:26.759 --> 26:28.238
- Well, that's the thing.

26:28.282 --> 26:29.979
She just wanted to talk
about what happened,

26:30.023 --> 26:33.592
like, Edge, powers, Grandpa...

26:34.462 --> 26:35.811

26:35.855 --> 26:37.378

I didn't say anything.

26:37.421 --> 26:38.814
- We need to talk.

26:38.858 --> 26:41.121
- Yeah, we do.
Jon skipped class.

26:41.164 --> 26:42.688
- What?
Go upstairs.

26:42.731 --> 26:45.168
I will deal with you later.

26:53.046 --> 26:56.266
You told my dad to keep 7734?

26:56.310 --> 26:57.790
I should have talked

26:57.833 --> 27:00.619

27:01.968 --> 27:03.796
After everything
we've been through--

27:03.839 --> 27:05.362
- I know.
I know.

27:05.406 --> 27:06.799
- Why?

27:06.842 --> 27:08.278
- Because it's
the right thing to do.

27:08.322 --> 27:10.237
- This isn't about Edge, is it?
This is about you.

27:10.280 --> 27:11.717
- Lois, I almost
killed John Irons.

27:11.760 --> 27:13.806
- But you didn't.
- Yeah, but what if I had?

27:13.849 --> 27:15.895
I mean,
who would have been next?

27:15.938 --> 27:17.853
Look, I swore to protect
the people of this planet.

27:17.897 --> 27:19.333
So far, I've done a decent job,

27:19.376 --> 27:21.248
but what if I was
to be tricked or corrupted?

27:21.291 --> 27:24.991
- That will never happen.
- Except that it just did.

27:25.818 --> 27:27.602
The people of this
world deserve

27:27.646 --> 27:28.864
the means to defend themselves

27:28.908 --> 27:31.040
from the one thing
me.

27:31.084 --> 27:32.781
- If weapons like that exist,

27:32.825 --> 27:34.957
then the wrong people
will get their hands on them,

27:35.001 --> 27:38.308
and then what do we do?

27:41.703 --> 27:42.704
Not enough to skip school.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.750
This one has
to go get arrested.

27:44.793 --> 27:45.794
- If they're both acting out,

27:45.838 --> 27:47.013
we'll give them a punishment.

27:47.056 --> 27:48.492
-
I'll drive.

27:48.536 --> 27:49.929
- Lois, about the other thing?
- What?

27:49.972 --> 27:51.452
I'm right.
You're wrong.

27:51.495 --> 27:53.846
- I understand why
you would think that.

27:53.889 --> 27:55.238
- Do you know what it was like

27:55.282 --> 27:56.979
when my dad
gave John Henry Irons

27:57.023 --> 27:58.851
the go-ahead
to fire the missile?

27:58.894 --> 28:00.200
- I'm sorry.

28:00.243 --> 28:01.723
- Then why risk
it happening again?

28:01.767 --> 28:02.985
- I told you because it's--

28:03.029 --> 28:04.552
- Because it's
the right thing to do.

28:04.595 --> 28:06.728
What does that
even mean anymore, Clark?

28:06.772 --> 28:09.862
I lied to Chrissy today
to protect our family.

28:09.905 --> 28:12.778
I broke my sacred role
as a journalist.

28:12.821 --> 28:14.214
- We both play fast and loose

28:14.257 --> 28:15.955
with journalistic integrity
from time to time.

28:15.998 --> 28:17.957
- When it comes
to keeping your secret,

28:18.000 --> 28:19.436
not the stories we investigate.

28:19.480 --> 28:20.786
- Yeah,
but Edge is my brother.

28:20.829 --> 28:23.092
He's Kryptonian.
This story is different.

28:23.136 --> 28:25.921
- Why should I be okay with the
military having the secret code

28:25.965 --> 28:27.183
to kill my husband,

28:27.227 --> 28:29.969
given the countless psychos
who want you dead?

28:30.012 --> 28:32.928
It just feels like
a really bad idea.

28:33.537 --> 28:35.061
- Lois, will you please
just listen--

28:35.104 --> 28:36.845
- No, there's nothing you can
say that I wanna hear,

28:36.889 --> 28:39.892
and now I'm angry, and I feel
sorry for yelling at you,

28:39.935 --> 28:41.676
but I also have to stay angry

28:41.720 --> 28:43.199
so that I can scare
the hell out of Jordan.

28:43.243 --> 28:45.027
So why don't you
just stay here,

28:45.071 --> 28:46.812
and let's just both
take a moment to think,

28:46.855 --> 28:47.813
and then we can talk
about this later

28:47.856 --> 28:50.685
after I bail our son
out of jail.

29:09.138 --> 29:11.184
- What were you doing?
- I can't believe you, guys.

29:11.227 --> 29:14.317
- I can explain.
- I'm so sorry.

29:14.361 --> 29:16.885
- Lana, and you must
be Jordan's mom.

29:16.929 --> 29:18.800
- Kya, what's going on?

29:18.844 --> 29:21.455
- They were caught trespassing
out by Atlas Pond.

29:21.498 --> 29:23.457
- Are you kidding me?

29:23.500 --> 29:25.981
When we were their age, we used
to go there all the time.

29:26.025 --> 29:26.939
- I don't know what to tell you

29:26.982 --> 29:28.114
other than
it's private property.

29:29.855 --> 29:32.596
- Deputy, if Lana didn't even
know it was private property,

29:32.640 --> 29:34.381
then I'm sure
the kids didn't either,

29:34.424 --> 29:35.948
and I promise you,
there's a world

29:35.991 --> 29:37.427
of just unimaginable horror

29:37.471 --> 29:39.995
that awaits my son
for skipping school.

29:40.039 --> 29:42.955
- The same goes for Sarah.
This will never happen again.

29:42.998 --> 29:44.870
- Just because she let you
two go with a warning

29:44.913 --> 29:46.523
doesn't mean it didn't happen.
- Mom--

29:46.567 --> 29:48.830
- Don't talk yet.
- As I've been saying,

29:48.874 --> 29:50.919
the Cushings
are the real problem here.

29:50.963 --> 29:52.878
Honestly, Sheriff,
I was suspicious

29:52.921 --> 29:54.444
of Morgan Edge from day one.

29:54.488 --> 29:56.316
But you know Kyle,
he just pushed and pushed

29:56.359 --> 29:58.971
until he finally got his way.

29:59.014 --> 30:01.277
I mean, honestly,

30:01.321 --> 30:03.758
we're the real victims here.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.455
Who knows what kind of perks

30:05.499 --> 30:08.284
they got from Lana's
special little job.

30:08.894 --> 30:11.418
- Zero perks.
- Lana--

30:11.461 --> 30:13.855
- We got lied to just
like everyone else.

30:13.899 --> 30:16.727
Just like you lied when you
said you were gonna help us.

30:16.771 --> 30:18.251
- Why don't you and I
go talk somewhere else?

30:18.294 --> 30:20.949
- You said you were gonna
set the record straight,

30:20.993 --> 30:23.343
and all you're doing
is covering your ass

30:23.386 --> 30:25.954
so you don't feel the blowback
come election time.

30:25.998 --> 30:27.086
- I'm doing what's best
for the town.

30:27.129 --> 30:29.044
- You're doing
what's best for you

30:29.088 --> 30:30.872
at the expense of my family,

30:30.916 --> 30:34.006
and for that, shame on you.

30:40.055 --> 30:41.187
- You okay?

30:41.230 --> 30:42.971
- I don't know
what I am right now.

30:43.015 --> 30:45.582
I feel so many things.
- Mostly anger, right?

30:45.626 --> 30:49.456
- So much anger.
Have you ever noticed--

30:49.499 --> 30:50.936
- How punchable
the mayor's face is?

30:50.979 --> 30:52.502
Yeah, I have.

30:52.546 --> 30:53.590
- God.

30:53.634 --> 30:56.942
You know,
he's not the only one.

30:56.985 --> 30:59.074
I mean, it's like
this entire town

30:59.118 --> 31:00.336
has turned their back on us.

31:00.380 --> 31:02.077
- They're just looking
for a way to move on.

31:02.121 --> 31:04.514
Blaming you is easier
than blaming themselves.

31:04.558 --> 31:07.039
- Yeah, but it doesn't
make it hurt any less.

31:07.082 --> 31:09.389
Smallville has always
been there for me.

31:09.432 --> 31:11.913
It's why I built
my life around it,

31:11.957 --> 31:14.916
and now I'm wishing
I had a backup plan

31:14.960 --> 31:17.136
because I'm out there
in the cold

31:17.179 --> 31:19.007
with no nest egg

31:19.051 --> 31:20.704
and no connections
anywhere else.

31:20.748 --> 31:24.273
And I am worried
about my family, Lois,

31:24.317 --> 31:26.493
especially when people
like Mayor Dean

31:26.536 --> 31:28.582
are out there
controlling the narrative.

31:28.625 --> 31:32.716
It's not right.
It's not right.

31:32.760 --> 31:36.198
And it's not the same town
I used to love.

31:42.683 --> 31:45.860
- Go to your room.
We'll talk about this later.

31:51.126 --> 31:53.041
- Hey.

31:53.085 --> 31:55.522
- They let them go
with a warning.

31:57.828 --> 31:59.787
- That's good.

31:59.830 --> 32:02.485
Jon's still up in his room.

32:04.009 --> 32:05.880
We should talk about--
- We need to talk about--

32:08.100 --> 32:09.797
- You first.

32:14.019 --> 32:16.151
- Clark, you are wrong.

32:16.195 --> 32:19.415
-
Lois, we have to have a plan.

32:19.459 --> 32:20.547
- Why?

32:20.590 --> 32:22.331
Because your mind
is corruptible?

32:22.375 --> 32:24.246
We have proof now.

32:24.290 --> 32:27.119
Your heart is stronger
than your mind.

32:27.162 --> 32:28.772
- No, you don't understand.

32:28.816 --> 32:30.774
- Clark, I'm all
about backup plans,

32:30.818 --> 32:33.212
but this one comes
with major risks,

32:33.255 --> 32:36.084
and for a reason
you've proven isn't a threat.

32:37.999 --> 32:40.523
That's not entirely true.

32:42.264 --> 32:44.223
- What are you talking about?

32:50.142 --> 32:52.448
- My dad taught me control.

32:53.754 --> 32:55.930
I have been controlling
my powers

32:55.974 --> 32:57.236
every second of every day

32:57.279 --> 33:00.108
for almost 40 years,

33:00.152 --> 33:01.980
but when Zod took over,

33:02.023 --> 33:03.329
for the first time,

33:03.372 --> 33:06.375
I felt what it was like
to let go.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.075
To really let go.

33:10.118 --> 33:13.034
- Clark, those were
Zod's emotions, not yours.

33:13.078 --> 33:16.124
- I know, but I felt it.

33:16.168 --> 33:18.300
It was me.

33:19.345 --> 33:22.261
And I'm not saying
I want this to be true.

33:22.304 --> 33:24.524
I wish it wasn't...

33:28.136 --> 33:30.399
But it felt good.

33:30.443 --> 33:33.141
It felt really, really good,

33:33.185 --> 33:35.317
and that feeling worries me.

33:35.361 --> 33:37.624
If there's even
the slightest chance that

33:37.667 --> 33:41.671
I could be manipulated again
with that desire to let go...

33:45.414 --> 33:48.722
The world needs a way
to stop me.

33:49.679 --> 33:51.986
- I don't think
that will ever happen.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.510
- Lois--
- But...

33:54.554 --> 33:57.600
on the off chance I'm wrong,

33:57.644 --> 34:01.213
and if this will make you
feel better, then fine.

34:01.256 --> 34:02.475
Let's have a fail-safe,

34:02.518 --> 34:05.304
but there is no way in hell

34:05.347 --> 34:07.436
I'm trusting the DOD with this.

34:09.525 --> 34:12.311
- Then we just have to find
someone we can.

34:12.354 --> 34:14.313
<i>- You wanna run that
by me again?</i>

34:14.356 --> 34:16.097
- I know it's a lot to ask.

34:16.141 --> 34:18.795
- You want me and only me

34:18.839 --> 34:20.319
to have the capability
to kill you?

34:20.362 --> 34:23.496
- Should it become
necessary, yes.

34:24.236 --> 34:26.107
- But I know who you are now.

34:26.151 --> 34:29.067
- I know, but this is about
situations we can't predict,

34:29.110 --> 34:31.199
and you've seen firsthand

34:31.243 --> 34:33.158
the devastation
I can cause this world.

34:33.201 --> 34:34.246
- I'm trying to move on.

34:34.289 --> 34:36.813
Remember, now that killing you

34:36.857 --> 34:38.250
isn't my singular purpose
in life...

34:38.293 --> 34:39.990
- And it shouldn't be.

34:40.034 --> 34:42.297
John, I have no doubt you'll
find your way in this world,

34:42.341 --> 34:46.345
but I believe you can do that
and be 7734's gatekeeper.

34:47.433 --> 34:50.305
You came here to protect
this world from me,

34:50.349 --> 34:52.612
that's what
I'm asking you to do.

34:57.225 --> 34:58.748
- I'll call Sam.

35:10.151 --> 35:13.241
- Wasn't expecting to see you.

35:13.285 --> 35:15.287
- I owe you an apology.

35:15.330 --> 35:17.419
- Kinda busy, Lois.

35:19.421 --> 35:22.163
-- You were right.
-I lied.

35:23.730 --> 35:26.472
My dad is hiding something,
and I can't betray his trust.

35:26.515 --> 35:29.257
- This story is bigger
than you or your dad.

35:29.301 --> 35:31.564
We have a responsibility
to the people.

35:31.607 --> 35:33.218
This town is falling apart.

35:33.261 --> 35:35.350
- Believe me, I know.

35:35.394 --> 35:37.178
People are tearing
each other down,

35:37.222 --> 35:39.224
looking for someone to blame,
and if we do nothing,

35:39.267 --> 35:42.183
we are as responsible for
its downfall as anyone else.

35:42.227 --> 35:44.316
- If only there was something
we could do.

35:44.359 --> 35:45.534
- I can't write this story.

35:45.578 --> 35:49.059
I'm too close to it
to be objective...

35:50.800 --> 35:52.672
But you can.

36:01.376 --> 36:04.510
- It's a statement...
from your dad.

36:04.553 --> 36:06.512
- He wouldn't go on the record
about everything,

36:06.555 --> 36:08.514
but this is enough
to tell most of the story

36:08.557 --> 36:11.343
and to focus the blame

36:11.386 --> 36:13.214
on Morgan Edge.

36:15.260 --> 36:17.305
- This was really
messed up, Lois.

36:17.349 --> 36:18.828
- I know.

36:18.872 --> 36:20.830
I hope that I can
earn back your trust.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.272
<i>- What are you doing there?</i>

36:27.315 --> 36:29.230

36:29.274 --> 36:33.103
All this time I've been
without anyone of my kind,

36:33.147 --> 36:35.149
alone, Father,

36:35.193 --> 36:37.064
for years.

36:37.107 --> 36:38.370
How could you not tell me?

36:38.413 --> 36:40.589
- He is
of no consequence to you.

36:40.633 --> 36:42.243
- He's from the house of El.
He's my--

36:42.287 --> 36:43.505
- He's your brother, yes,

36:43.549 --> 36:45.768
by bloodline only,

36:45.812 --> 36:48.336
a pathetic
treasonous bloodline.

36:48.380 --> 36:50.251
- He's become a hero, Father.

36:50.295 --> 36:52.035
- He is nothing!

36:52.688 --> 36:56.170
- I'll find another way.
- You will do no such thing.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.432
- When I find the Eradicator,

36:57.476 --> 36:59.913
I'll show him what we can do.
- Tal, no.

36:59.956 --> 37:01.306
- I'll make myself knownto him,

37:01.349 --> 37:03.438
give him what he's been here
without as well.

37:03.482 --> 37:04.961
- Tal, listen to me.

37:05.005 --> 37:07.660
- I don't need to do
this your way, Father.

37:07.703 --> 37:09.792

the resurrection.

37:09.836 --> 37:12.447

to die to do it!

That's unacceptable.
