we got to get $48,000.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.013
That's a definite.

15:23.339 --> 15:25.558

save Marty's job after that.

Wow. I can see that you put
a lot of thought into it.

15:29.220 --> 15:30.722

How about we work out a plan,

15:30.847 --> 15:32.690

15:32.849 --> 15:34.021

the colored pencils.

to this. You don't...

19:35.091 --> 19:37.059
"Suffrage" has nothing
to do with pain. No pain.

No pain, no gain?

19:38.803 --> 19:39.895

you got something to say?

19:46.477 --> 19:48.605
Niko. But forget it.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.197
I'm sure it's wrong.
Please, look, there are

19:50.272 --> 19:51.524
no wrong answers here,
people. You know what?

19:51.607 --> 19:54.451
I'm gonna stop right there 'cause there
are obviously a lot of wrong answers,

19:54.568 --> 19:55.990
but there are a couple
wrong answers, but...

19:56.112 --> 19:58.240
It's okay, there are.

19:58.322 --> 20:00.074
But let's give it a shot anyway.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.250
The right to vote?

20:02.827 --> 20:04.295
Yes! There?

20:04.453 --> 20:07.172
You know what, "suffrage" is
the right to elect leaders.

20:07.289 --> 20:08.461
You understand, right, Miguel?

20:08.582 --> 20:09.754
I do, I do.

20:09.834 --> 20:10.960
Okay, good.

20:21.262 --> 20:22.639

20:23.139 --> 20:24.140

20:25.474 --> 20:27.021

20:27.643 --> 20:28.986
But when it comes to taking tests,

20:29.437 --> 20:31.189
I get all clenched in the tight spot.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.320
If I fail this citizenship test,

20:33.816 --> 20:34.988
they'll send me back to Holland.

20:35.359 --> 20:37.032
And things here are
just starting to twist.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.159
I'm sorry, is that good?
I don't even...

20:39.321 --> 20:40.664
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Twisting is good.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.492
So, I was wondering,

20:42.950 --> 20:45.703
is there any way you can
give me a little extra help?

20:46.829 --> 20:47.876
Extra help?

20:47.997 --> 20:49.590
Yeah, you know what, I kind of got,

20:49.665 --> 20:50.962

won the Lord's respect.

01:10:26.639 --> 01:10:27.686
No, it's not.

01:10:27.807 --> 01:10:29.684
It's, like, the weirdest date ever.

01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:31.485
(SIGHS) You know what'?

01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:32.733
You're sort of right.

01:10:32.812 --> 01:10:34.359
Yeah, yeah, you are right.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:35.652
'Cause I don't know
what I was thinking.

01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:36.824
Hey!
(BELLA YELLING)

01:10:39.986 --> 01:10:41.283
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:43.205
Okay. This is definitely
the weirdest date ever.

01:10:43.322 --> 01:10:45.245
Yeah.

01:10:45.366 --> 01:10:46.834
Good night, Scott.

01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:49.003
Yep, okay.

01:10:50.329 --> 01:10:51.455
(SIGHS)

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:53.507
Well, this was a nice dinner.

01:10:54.834 --> 01:10:56.336
Sorry about the lamp.

01:10:56.502 --> 01:10:57.549
I wouldn't worry about it.

01:10:57.670 --> 01:11:00.173
I wouldn't worry about it at all.
You can just leave that there.

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.058
You're good. All right.

01:11:03.217 --> 01:11:06.721
By the way, a little
cologne goes a long way.

01:11:06.846 --> 01:11:08.473
Yeah, no, I know. I felt it.
My eyes were burning.

01:11:08.556 --> 01:11:09.808
I hear you.

01:11:09.891 --> 01:11:10.938
BOY: Give it to me!
(KIDS CLAMORING)

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:13.315
Hey-

01:11:13.394 --> 01:11:14.566
Hey. Can you get
away for an hour?

01:11:14.687 --> 01:11:15.939
I got something for you.

01:11:16.063 --> 01:11:17.656
I can't, guy.
This is a bad time.

01:11:17.732 --> 01:11:19.484
This one thought
the Ex-Lax was chocolate.

01:11:19.567 --> 01:11:20.944
I'm up to my eyes in it.

01:11:21.027 --> 01:11:22.779
Lauren thinks it's my fault.
LAUREN: It is!

01:11:22.904 --> 01:11:24.372
ERIC: Says you!

01:11:24.447 --> 01:11:26.199
Who keeps Ex-Lax in
their back pocket?

01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:27.499
I had a situation!

01:11:27.575 --> 01:11:28.747
You're a situation!

01:11:28.868 --> 01:11:30.461
Whatever!
Where do you want to go?

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.543
You got to wash your face first.

01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:33.957
Okay, got you.

01:11:34.081 --> 01:11:35.424
BOY: (IN DISTANCE)
Ow! Stop kicking me!

01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:37.088
SCOTT: Yeah,
and change your clothes.

01:11:38.461 --> 01:11:39.508
Hey, what's up?

01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:41.385
What are you doing here?
We training today?

01:11:41.464 --> 01:11:42.590
Nah, nah, we're good.

01:11:42.715 --> 01:11:44.308
Look, I told you
when you joined my team

01:11:44.383 --> 01:11:45.555
I had your back, right?

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:46.887
Yeah.

01:11:47.053 --> 01:11:48.805
I just thought you should
know Joe Rogan called.

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:50.268
They want you to fight in the UFC.

01:11:50.431 --> 01:11:51.648
It's 10 grand.

01:11:51.724 --> 01:11:52.771
To lose?

01:11:52.892 --> 01:11:53.893
Yup.

01:11:54.602 --> 01:11:57.776
Yes! Yes!

01:11:57.939 --> 01:11:59.156
Niko turned it down.

01:12:00.733 --> 01:12:02.030
He what?

01:12:02.109 --> 01:12:04.453
NIKO: Relax.

01:12:05.404 --> 01:12:07.907
Om...

01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:11.248
Let your tailbone be heavy.

01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:14.914
Om...

01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:17.416
(LAUGHS) Hey!

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:20.049
Relax. Relax.

01:12:20.127 --> 01:12:23.427
Back to the peaceful meadow.

01:12:23.631 --> 01:12:24.723
(MAKES CHIRPING NOISE)

01:12:24.799 --> 01:12:26.346
(LAUGHS QUIETLY)

01:12:32.598 --> 01:12:34.100
Hey, why would you pass on the UFC'?

01:12:34.809 --> 01:12:36.356
You're not ready for a fight like this.

01:12:36.435 --> 01:12:39.279
You realize we're six grand away
and the semester's almost over?

01:12:39.438 --> 01:12:41.190
It's too dangerous.

01:12:41.315 --> 01:12:43.113
Yeah. But this
could be one and clone.

01:12:43.192 --> 01:12:44.910
Hey, the UFC's the real deal,
all right?

01:12:44.986 --> 01:12:46.283
It's big-time.

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:48.330
There's no broken cages or
chickens running around.

01:12:48.447 --> 01:12:49.949
Okay, you know what?
I got to be honest here.

01:12:50.116 --> 01:12:51.493
I don't see what the problem is.

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:53.961
Oh, yeah, okay.
You know the problem?

01:12:54.036 --> 01:12:57.461
The problem is we're the same
age, and I can kick your ass!

01:12:57.707 --> 01:12:59.129
(GRUNTS)

01:13:00.626 --> 01:13:02.879
You know, maybe we should...

01:13:04.297 --> 01:13:05.469
You know what?
He's up, he's okay.

01:13:05.548 --> 01:13:07.391
You're a schoolteacher, Scott!

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:10.394
I devoted my whole life to fighting.

01:13:11.971 --> 01:13:14.065
And you should've been given this shot.

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:15.440
I was good, Scott.

01:13:15.516 --> 01:13:18.440
When I was fighting, man,
I was beating everybody.

01:13:18.519 --> 01:13:19.816
I was unstoppable.

01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:22.991
And then when I got my big
break to fight for the UFC,

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:25.318
I thought to step it up.

01:13:26.152 --> 01:13:30.407
And during training,
I just destroyed my neck.

01:13:30.531 --> 01:13:31.828
That was it.

01:13:31.991 --> 01:13:33.368
Over.

01:13:33.534 --> 01:13:35.286
I'm so sorry.
I didn't know that.

01:13:35.369 --> 01:13:37.417
Look, if you don't think
I deserve this fight,

01:13:37.496 --> 01:13:38.748
you know what, I'm not gonna take it.

01:13:38.831 --> 01:13:40.083
No, you deserve it.

01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:41.880
It's just me. It's...

01:13:42.001 --> 01:13:44.675
I'll set this up.

01:13:44.754 --> 01:13:46.051
I'm sorry, bud.

01:13:46.172 --> 01:13:48.266
Yeah.

01:13:50.217 --> 01:13:54.188
It's just...
Yoga makes me emotional.

01:13:57.725 --> 01:13:59.398
Mr. Voss, welcome.

01:13:59.518 --> 01:14:00.861
Come, this way.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.363
I want to thank you for your help.

01:14:04.023 --> 01:14:05.570
<i>Business has never been better.</i>

01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:07.113
Oh, that's great.
I'm so glad.

01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:08.573
Your table.
Joe. What's up'?

01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:09.695
What's up, Niko?
How are you, brother'?

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:10.826
Scott, nice to meet you.

01:14:10.905 --> 01:14:11.952
I am such a big fan.

01:14:12.031 --> 01:14:13.078
Oh, thank you.
Thanks, man.

01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:14.451
Joe Rogan, wow.

01:14:14.533 --> 01:14:16.456
I showed Dana White
some of your fights,

01:14:16.577 --> 01:14:18.500
and I was there at the Romero fight.

01:14:18.579 --> 01:14:20.001
Great job when you put him down.

01:14:20.081 --> 01:14:22.049
That is a tough guy.
That's a serious win.

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:24.047
Yeah, thanks. Thanks so much.
ERIC: Good evening, gentlemen.

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:27.756
I have created some
delicious lettuce wraps,

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:32.226
prepared with very little oil
and a hint of ginger.

01:14:34.637 --> 01:14:35.809
Thanks.

01:14:35.888 --> 01:14:39.859
Actually, best eaten while hot, so...

01:14:39.934 --> 01:14:41.026
Yeah, we're gonna...

01:14:41.102 --> 01:14:42.399
ERIC: Enjoy.
Yep, yeah.

01:14:43.729 --> 01:14:45.481
(QUIETLY) Get out of here.

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:47.275
Okay.

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.653
Thanks.

01:14:49.735 --> 01:14:51.237
So, here's the deal.

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:54.290
The UFC had a fighter
fall out last minute

01:14:54.573 --> 01:14:56.871
in an undercard fight
against Ken Dietrich

01:14:56.951 --> 01:14:58.749
in Las Vegas next week.

01:14:58.911 --> 01:15:00.834
Dana's a little worried
you might throw up on him.

01:15:00.955 --> 01:15:02.798
No, no, that was
a one-time deal.

01:15:02.915 --> 01:15:05.714
I'm telling you, it was some bad
applesauce that got away from me.

01:15:05.793 --> 01:15:07.761
It won't happen again.
Good to hear.

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:09.680
Look, my daughter got
into music in middle school.

01:15:09.755 --> 01:15:11.052
It changed her life.

01:15:11.132 --> 01:15:14.181
And I think what you're doing
is awesome, and the UFC agrees.

01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:15.978
We'd like to give you a shot.

01:15:16.095 --> 01:15:17.813
Now, Niko, you had some concerns'?

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:21.563
He's ready.

01:15:21.642 --> 01:15:23.144
JOE: Okay, good.

01:15:23.269 --> 01:15:24.612
I'm gonna grab one of
these lettuce things,

01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:25.942
and I'll see you boys in Vegas.

01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:27.274
All right, Joe, thanks.
Good luck, sir.

01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:28.858
Wow. Thank you.

01:15:28.983 --> 01:15:30.280
You got yourself a fight!

01:15:30.401 --> 01:15:31.698
Fight!

01:15:31.819 --> 01:15:33.696
MARTY: Okay. I can't believe
that we're doing this.

01:15:33.821 --> 01:15:34.868
NIKO: Ding, ding, ding, ding.

01:15:34.947 --> 01:15:36.494
Oh, my God, I love you guys!

01:15:36.615 --> 01:15:38.617
I really do.
Take it easy, Marty.

01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:40.123
Oh! Listen,

01:15:40.286 --> 01:15:42.459
I have a window seat and I pee a lot.

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:44.211
Do you mind if I...
Okay, we're switching seats.

01:15:44.331 --> 01:15:45.958
Thank you very much.

01:15:46.459 --> 01:15:47.506
I'll be right back, honey.

01:15:47.626 --> 01:15:48.627
Okay.

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:51.885
Hey, Scott. Can I talk
to you for a second?

01:15:52.006 --> 01:15:53.303
Sure.

01:15:53.382 --> 01:15:55.009
I just want to tell you
how grateful we are

01:15:55.134 --> 01:15:57.353
for everything you've been
doing for my family.

01:15:57.511 --> 01:15:59.309
It's been an honor.

01:15:59.472 --> 01:16:01.019
He's my hero.

01:16:01.182 --> 01:16:02.809
(MAN SINGING)

01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:05.148
Mine, too.

01:16:07.855 --> 01:16:08.981
Thank you.

01:16:10.816 --> 01:16:12.489
All right, you gonna
wish me luck or what?

01:16:12.651 --> 01:16:14.494
Please be careful.

01:16:14.653 --> 01:16:17.953
Niko says this guy you're
fighting is really dangerous.

01:16:18.032 --> 01:16:20.000
Look, I'm going in there,
I'm gonna lose the fight,

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:21.703
get my 10 grand, and I'm getting out.

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:23.329
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:16:25.664 --> 01:16:29.339
I know you really want
to kiss me right now.

01:16:29.418 --> 01:16:31.170
But I think we have
something special here,

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:33.722
and I don't want to rush the magic.

01:16:33.839 --> 01:16:35.466
Okay, first of all, do you
know anything about magic?

01:16:35.549 --> 01:16:36.926
'Cause magic has to be rushed,

01:16:37.009 --> 01:16:38.226
otherwise you can see
how the trick is done.

01:16:38.344 --> 01:16:39.846
So, bring it in.

01:16:40.721 --> 01:16:41.768
MARTY:
Boom!

<i>It's all right, it's all right</i>

01:16:54.026 --> 01:16:55.494
Give him your best shot, Scott.

01:16:55.569 --> 01:16:56.741
Right here.

01:16:57.196 --> 01:16:58.288
<i>Boom</i>

01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:46.287
What is that?

01:17:46.412 --> 01:17:47.959
Cherry cheesecake, guy.

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.832
That looks heavenly.

01:17:49.915 --> 01:17:50.962
Could I have one?

01:17:51.083 --> 01:17:52.426
Thank you so much.
