WEBVTT

00:04.638 --> 00:06.274
JIMMY!

00:06.307 --> 00:08.809
JIMMY!

00:08.842 --> 00:10.378
JIMMY!
COME ON, JIMMY,

00:10.411 --> 00:12.346
I KNOW YOU CAN
HEAR ME. COME ON.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.215
COME ON, THIS
ISN'T PRODUCTIVE.

00:14.248 --> 00:17.551
HEY, JAMES FRANCIS
FINNERTY, COME ON OUT!

00:17.585 --> 00:19.787
JIMMY?

00:19.820 --> 00:21.289
ANY SIGN OF HIM?

00:21.322 --> 00:22.056
NO.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.524
ARE YOU EVEN LOOKING?

00:23.557 --> 00:26.260
YEAH, I'M LOOKING.

00:26.294 --> 00:28.629
YOU'RE A TERRIFIC UNCLE,
YOU KNOW.

00:28.662 --> 00:29.497
JIMMY!

00:29.530 --> 00:32.066
HOW CAN YOU EAT THIS
LOWFAT CREAM CHEESE?

00:32.100 --> 00:32.866
IT'S LIKE PASTE.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.102
WHAT KIND DO YOU
HAVE AT YOUR HOUSE?

00:34.135 --> 00:36.604
I DON'T KEEP FOOD
AT MY HOUSE.

00:37.171 --> 00:38.206
WHY WOULD YOU?

00:38.239 --> 00:41.175
OH, AND YOU'RE
ALL OUT OF JELLY,
EXCEPT FOR GRAPE.

00:41.209 --> 00:44.078
NOW GET IN
THE BACKYARD AND
LOOK FOR JIMMY.

00:44.112 --> 00:45.346
COME ON.

00:45.379 --> 00:46.847
STILL NO SIGN
OF HIM, HUH?

00:46.880 --> 00:48.549
WHOO! LOOK AT YOU.

00:48.582 --> 00:52.420
HING--CHOW--
DING--GOW!

00:52.453 --> 00:54.622
IT'S THE REGULAR
OLD WORK CLOTHES, BABY.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.390
WELL, I'M NEVER HOME
WHEN YOU GO TO WORK.

00:56.424 --> 00:59.160
HA HA HA HA!
OH, YES,
THIS IS VERY GOOD.

00:59.193 --> 01:01.829
WHAT BETTER WAY
OF LURING OUR SON
OUT OF HIDING

01:01.862 --> 01:06.066
THAN THE PROMISE OF
SEEING HIS PARENTS
HAVING SEX?

01:06.367 --> 01:08.802
IT'S NOTHING
HE HASN'T SEEN
BEFORE.

01:08.836 --> 01:12.173
NOT A MEMORY THAT'S
HELPING YOUR CAUSE.

01:12.206 --> 01:13.574
DID YOU CHECK
THE ATTIC?

01:13.607 --> 01:14.408
NO.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.677
SO, SO FAR
YOUR ENTIRE
SEARCH PROCESS

01:16.710 --> 01:18.712
HAS CONSISTED OF YOU
WANDERING AROUND
THE HOUSE

01:18.746 --> 01:19.713
YELLING "JIMMY"?

01:19.747 --> 01:21.249
NO, I ALSO SWORE A LOT.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.684
HMM. HOW'D THAT
WORK OUT?

01:23.717 --> 01:24.585
NOT GREAT.

01:24.618 --> 01:25.353
YEAH. ALL RIGHT.

01:25.386 --> 01:27.255
YOU JUST
LET THE MASTER
TAKE OVER.

01:27.288 --> 01:30.891
I'M HIS MOM, I KNOW
HOW HE THINKS.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.526
YOU GOTTA CALL WORK
AND TELL THEM

01:32.560 --> 01:34.328
I'M GONNA BE
A LITTLE BIT LATE.

01:35.396 --> 01:36.730
Lily: OHH! I'M ONLINE!

01:36.764 --> 01:37.398
SORRY!

01:37.431 --> 01:39.467
OH, NICE JOB!
DISCONNECTED!

01:39.500 --> 01:40.734
HEY, WAIT! SHOULDN'T
YOU BE AT SCHOOL?

01:40.768 --> 01:42.903
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.
I WAS UPLOADING
MY HOMEWORK.

01:42.936 --> 01:46.140
NOW IT'S DESTROYED.
THE FILE IS DESTROYED.

01:46.174 --> 01:48.776
YOU WERE IN
THE JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE
CHAT ROOM.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.778
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.581
GOD, I'M SO FAT.
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M EATING THIS.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.350
AH, YOU'RE NOT FAT.
YOU'RE A LITTLE
STICK GIRL.

01:56.384 --> 01:57.451
IT'S DISTURBING.

01:57.485 --> 01:58.319
THANK YOU.

01:58.352 --> 01:59.753
DON'T EAT
BOTH OF THEM.

01:59.787 --> 02:00.754
DAD,
WHAT'S THAT?

02:00.788 --> 02:02.790
BROUGHT YOU
A LITTLE SOMETHING
I FOUND AT WORK.

02:02.823 --> 02:04.392
Claudia:
YOU WORK AT A DUMP.

02:04.425 --> 02:07.161
I SUPERVISE
A SANITARY LANDFILL.

02:07.195 --> 02:09.363
LOOK WHAT SOME IDIOT
THREW AWAY--

02:09.397 --> 02:11.332
A PERFECTLY GOOD SET
OF ENCYCLOPEDIAS.

02:11.365 --> 02:14.868
OH, MY GOD! WELL,
THEY HAVE THE STENCH
OF DEATH ON THEM.

02:14.902 --> 02:18.539
YOU DON'T
SMELL THEM,
YOU READ THEM.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.040
WHY DON'T YOU KEEP THEM
AT YOUR HOUSE?

02:20.073 --> 02:24.512
I'LL JUST PUT THEM
DOWN HERE FOR YOU,
LET THEM BREATHE.

02:24.545 --> 02:26.647
JIMMY AIN'T OUT THERE.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.382
OK, YOU ARE PATHETIC.

02:28.416 --> 02:30.751
I WILL FIND HIM.
I ALWAYS FIND HIM.

02:30.784 --> 02:31.585
JIMMY'S LOST?

02:31.619 --> 02:35.323
NO, NO, HE'S--
HE'S JUST HIDING. AGAIN.

02:35.356 --> 02:36.857
WHY ISN'T HE IN SCHOOL?

02:36.890 --> 02:38.359
UH, HE'S NOT GOING
TO SCHOOL THIS WEEK,

02:38.392 --> 02:40.761
AND I DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

02:40.794 --> 02:43.564
OH, SEANY SCREWED UP
AGAIN, DIDN'T HE?

02:43.597 --> 02:44.632
NO, NO, DAD. LOOK...

02:44.665 --> 02:45.833
SUNDAY WAS "THE TASTE
OF STATEN ISLAND"
FESTIVAL,

02:45.866 --> 02:50.704
SO WE WENT, SO WE COULD
DO SOMETHING TOGETHER
AS A FAMILY.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.843
OHH! EWW.
WHAT?

02:55.876 --> 02:59.580
I DON'T WANT
ANYBODY FROM SCHOOL
TO SEE ME WITH THEM.

02:59.613 --> 03:00.314
WHY NOT?

03:00.348 --> 03:03.851
A TIGER AND A ZEBRA?
IT'S SO GAY.

03:03.884 --> 03:04.718
HEY! HO, HO!

03:04.752 --> 03:07.555
THAT'S NOT
AN APPROPRIATE
THING TO SAY.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.590
I'M GAY 'CAUSE
I'M A ZEBRA?

03:09.623 --> 03:10.157
NO!

03:10.190 --> 03:11.592
ARE TIGERS GAY?
NO.

03:11.625 --> 03:12.393
WHAT'S GAY?

03:12.426 --> 03:14.728
NOTHING, NOTHING.
GAY MEANS NOTHING.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.564
I'M GAY.

03:17.631 --> 03:20.668
BUT I'M SEEING
SOMEONE RIGHT NOW.

03:21.602 --> 03:24.405
THEY HAVE A GLASS BLOWING
DEMONSTRATION AT 5:30,

03:24.438 --> 03:25.839
CANDLE DIPPING...

03:25.873 --> 03:28.609
HOLD THIS. HOLD THIS.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.511
OH, MY GOD.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.813
DO YOU KNOW WHO'S PLAYING
AT THE BANDSHELL TONIGHT?

03:32.846 --> 03:33.881
I GIVE UP.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.616
MM-HMM.

03:35.649 --> 03:38.819
RAMONES!
RAMONES!

03:38.852 --> 03:39.820
RAMONES?

03:39.853 --> 03:41.955
THE RAMONES,
IN THEIR FAREWELL TOUR.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.824
WE GO TO ALL THEIR
FAREWELL TOURS.

03:43.857 --> 03:47.595
YEAH, AND YOU NEVER KNOW,
THIS COULD BE THE LAST ONE.

03:47.628 --> 03:50.598
HEY, I WASN'T
TAKING ANY CHANCES.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.500
AH, THE RAMONES
ARE SO GAY.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.635
WHY? ARE SOME
OF THEM ZEBRAS?

03:54.668 --> 03:57.905
I WANT TO WIPE
MY FACE OFF.

04:00.641 --> 04:03.277
WE GOTTA
GET GOING.

04:03.511 --> 04:04.545
JIMMY,
IT'S THE RAMONES.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.014
IT'S THE SEMINAL
CULTURAL EVENT
IN YOUR YOUNG LIFE.

04:07.047 --> 04:09.817
I HAVE TO MAKE A MODEL
OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM
FOR MY SCIENCE CLASS.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.885
AND YOU WILL, OK?
BUT IT CAN WAIT A DAY.

04:11.919 --> 04:15.323
TRUST ME, SON. TOMORROW,
THE SOLAR SYSTEM
IS GONNA BE THERE.

04:15.356 --> 04:18.058
BUT THE RAMONES
ARE GONNA BE ON A BUS
TO PENNSYLVANIA,

04:18.091 --> 04:20.361
AND WHO KNOWS WHEN
THEY'RE COMING BACK?

04:20.394 --> 04:22.062
COME ON, GUYS,
I WANT TO GET THERE

04:22.095 --> 04:23.664
BEFORE THE MOSH PIT
FILLS UP.

04:23.697 --> 04:24.398
OK.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.400
LOOK, JIMMY,
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,

04:26.434 --> 04:27.335
THE RAMONES BURST
ONTO THE SCENE

04:27.368 --> 04:29.437
AND THEY
CHANGED THE FACE
OF ROCK AND ROLL.

04:29.470 --> 04:30.671
POST-PUNK, GRUNGE,
SPEED METAL--

04:30.704 --> 04:32.473
NONE OF IT WOULD HAVE
HAPPENED WITHOUT THEM.

04:32.506 --> 04:35.309
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TRUST ME ON THIS ONE.
I'M YOUR FATHER, OK?

04:35.343 --> 04:39.747
THE RAMONES
ARE MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

04:40.948 --> 04:44.785
* 20--20--24 HOURS TO GO

04:44.818 --> 04:46.654
* I WANNA BE SEDATED

04:46.687 --> 04:50.558
* NOTHING TO DO,
NOWHERE TO GO--OH *

04:50.591 --> 04:51.992
* I WANNA BE SEDATED

04:52.025 --> 04:55.663
* JUST GET ME TO THE AIRPORT,
PUT ME ON A PLANE *

04:55.696 --> 04:58.799
* HURRY, HURRY, HURRY,
BEFORE I GO INSANE *

04:58.832 --> 04:59.867
* I CAN'T CONTROL
MY FINGERS *

04:59.900 --> 05:04.304
* I CAN'T CONTROL MY BRAIN,
OH, NO, OH-HO OH-OHH *

05:20.688 --> 05:22.356
OK, JIMMY'S NOT
IN THE ATTIC.

05:22.390 --> 05:25.559
NOW I HAVE TUFTS
OF INSULATION
IN MY DRESS.

05:25.593 --> 05:26.827
WHOA.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.463
STOP PICTURING IT.

05:30.598 --> 05:33.000
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M THINKING.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.572
START SWEARING.
YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.541
NOT MY STYLE.

05:43.411 --> 05:44.344
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:44.378 --> 05:45.946
JUST MAKING SURE
YOU GET CHUNKY
PEANUT BUTTER.

05:45.979 --> 05:48.382
YOU NEVER GET
CHUNKY.

05:48.416 --> 05:49.617
KIDS DON'T LIKE CHUNKY.

05:49.650 --> 05:53.487
GET CREAMY, TOO.
THAT'S NO PROBLEM.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.756
IF I BUY YOU CREAMY,
WILL YOU EAT IT
AT YOUR HOUSE?

05:55.789 --> 05:58.726
I DON'T HAVE ANY BREAD.
I'LL GET YOU BREAD.

05:59.527 --> 06:02.730
ALL RIGHT, I'M LEAVING
THE BASEMENT NOW.

06:02.763 --> 06:03.864
WHEN I TURN OFF
THIS LIGHT,

06:03.897 --> 06:05.999
IT IS GONNA BE VERY DARK

06:06.033 --> 06:08.636
AND VERY SPOOKY.

06:08.669 --> 06:11.505
PERFECT FOR A GHOST.

06:15.142 --> 06:18.111
OOOH--OOOOH!
OOOH--OOOH!

06:18.546 --> 06:21.148
Sean: CHILDREN,
I EAT CHILDREN.

06:24.485 --> 06:27.054
WE CAN RULE OUT
THE BASEMENT.

06:27.788 --> 06:30.524
SO IT SEEMS
THAT CONCERT
YOU DRAGGED JIMMY TO

06:30.558 --> 06:31.925
REALLY DROVE HIM
AROUND THE BEND.

06:31.959 --> 06:36.029
NO, IT WASN'T THE CONCERT.
EVERYTHING WAS COOL
UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.400
OW!

06:42.870 --> 06:44.438
HI, KIDDO.

06:44.472 --> 06:45.138
WHAT?

06:45.172 --> 06:46.640
GOOD MORNING.

06:46.674 --> 06:47.608
WHAT?

06:47.641 --> 06:49.743
HE MAY HAVE BEEN
STANDING A LITTLE
TOO CLOSE

06:49.777 --> 06:50.878
TO THE SPEAKER
LAST NIGHT.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.547
OH, UH, SORRY, GUY.

06:53.581 --> 06:55.048
WHICH GUY?

06:55.082 --> 06:56.183
DON'T WORRY.

06:56.216 --> 06:57.885
WHAT?

06:57.918 --> 06:59.853
HEY, SOLDIER,
WHAT YOU BUILDING
OVER THERE?

06:59.887 --> 07:03.056
I TOLD YOU, I HAD
TO BUILD A MODEL
OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.559
HONEY, DO YOU WANT
SOME HELP WITH THAT?

07:05.593 --> 07:07.528
UM, NO, NO, NO.
NO, MOM.

07:07.561 --> 07:08.662
BUT, SEE, THESE ARE--
IT'S FINE.

07:08.696 --> 07:11.699
THIS ONE HAS THE TAPE--
I'LL FIX IT.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.067
THAT WAS JUPITER, MOM.

07:14.101 --> 07:17.905
IT'S IN
THE MILKY WAY,
RIGHT?

07:18.105 --> 07:20.508
IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO BE FUNNY?

07:20.541 --> 07:21.942
SORRY.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.110
IT'S RUINED.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.979
WHY'D YOU MAKE ME GO
TO THAT STUPID CONCERT?

07:26.013 --> 07:26.714
OH, COME ON,
JIMMY, HEY.

07:26.747 --> 07:27.781
DUDE, WE WERE
OPENING YOUR MIND.

07:27.815 --> 07:31.118
BESIDES, YOU HAD
A GOOD TIME LAST
NIGHT, DIDN'T YOU?

07:36.524 --> 07:37.457
I HATED IT.

07:37.491 --> 07:40.994
HEY, LILY, YOU
LIKED THE RAMONES,
DIDN'T YOU?

07:41.028 --> 07:42.129
WELL, THE MUSIC
WAS GOOD,

07:42.162 --> 07:44.698
BUT THEY WERE JUST
RIPPING OFF GREEN DAY.

07:44.732 --> 07:47.167
YOU GUYS
HEAR MY BRAIN
BUZZING?

07:47.200 --> 07:49.570
LILY,
CAN YOU TAKE HENRY
TO SCHOOL, PLEASE,

07:49.603 --> 07:50.938
SO HE DOESN'T
GET HIT BY A TRUCK?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.873
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET GOING!

07:52.906 --> 07:55.275
I'M TAKING YOU
TO SCHOOL TODAY!

07:55.308 --> 07:58.912
THANKS,
I ALREADY HAD SOME!

08:00.948 --> 08:03.183
I'M GONNA GET IN TROUBLE.

08:03.216 --> 08:04.518
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

08:04.552 --> 08:05.986
I'M YOUR FATHER, OK?

08:06.019 --> 08:08.088
I'M GONNA
WRITE YOU A NOTE.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.557
OK?

08:13.761 --> 08:15.295
SO I JUMP ON STAGE--WOW!

08:15.328 --> 08:17.164
OH, SHOOT.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.771
WHAT ARE YOU,
FREAKING KIDDING ME,
FINNERTY?!

08:23.804 --> 08:25.205
WHAT KIND OF
FLUNKING OPERATION

08:25.238 --> 08:26.139
DO YOU THINK
I'M RUNNING HERE?

08:26.173 --> 08:29.276
THIS IS THE NEW YORK
SMECKING SUBWAY SYSTEM!

08:29.309 --> 08:30.510
YOU DIRT-SUCKING
PIECE OF CAKE!

08:30.544 --> 08:34.047
Sean: YEAH, SO I GO TO
SEE JIMMY'S PRINCIPAL,
AND SHE'S ALL...

08:34.081 --> 08:35.015
RESPONSIBILITY...

08:35.048 --> 08:37.017
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,
BLAH, BLAH...

08:37.050 --> 08:37.951
ROLE MODELS...

08:37.985 --> 08:39.086
Sean: AND ALL ABOUT HOW...

08:39.119 --> 08:40.387
GOOD WORK HABITS
BEGIN AT HOME.

08:40.420 --> 08:44.091
ABSOLUTELY, SISTER.
I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING
THAT YOU'RE SAYING,

08:44.124 --> 08:45.058
AND I UNDERSTAND--
MM-HMM.

08:45.092 --> 08:47.828
WELL, I'M NOT SURE
THAT YOU DO,
MR. FINNERTY.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.931
LET ME READ--
"DEAR SISTER HELEN,

08:50.964 --> 08:54.201
"PLEASE EXCUSE JIMMY
FOR NOT HAVING
HIS SOLAR SYSTEM.

08:54.234 --> 08:57.638
"THE RAMONES WERE
PERFORMING AT
A FESTIVAL LAST NIGHT,

08:57.671 --> 09:02.275
AND HIS MOTHER AND I
FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT
THAT HE NOT MISS IT."

09:03.076 --> 09:04.878
THAT WAS SUCH
A LAME NOTE.

09:04.912 --> 09:05.646
IT WAS THE TRUTH!

09:05.679 --> 09:07.214
YOU DON'T TELL
THE TRUTH IN A NOTE.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.182
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LIE!

09:09.683 --> 09:12.185
"JIMMY'S SICK,"
"JIMMY SPRAINED HIS ANKLE,"

09:12.219 --> 09:14.054
"JIMMY'S
GRANDFATHER DIED."

09:14.087 --> 09:15.723
WHAT?

09:15.756 --> 09:16.957
AS AN EXAMPLE.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.892
LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA
TEACH MY SON TO LIE.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.761
BUT YOU WILL
TAKE HIM
TO SOME CONCERT

09:20.794 --> 09:22.195
WHEN HE SHOULD BE
DOING HIS HOMEWORK?

09:22.229 --> 09:24.331
NOT SOME CONCERT, DAD,
THE RAMONES!

09:24.364 --> 09:26.299
I DON'T CARE
IF IT WAS
THE RAMONES.

09:26.333 --> 09:29.069
I DON'T CARE
IF JIMI HENDRIX
ROSE FROM THE GRAVE.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.871
A CONCERT
IS NOT AS IMPORTANT
AS HOMEWORK.

09:30.904 --> 09:34.007
WHOA, WHOA, WAIT,
EVEN IF JIMI HENDRIX
ROSE FROM THE GRAVE?

09:34.041 --> 09:38.011
WELL, OK, THAT MIGHT
BE THE EXCEPTION.

09:38.045 --> 09:39.246
A-HA!

09:39.279 --> 09:40.914
I'M A NUN.
I COULDN'T VERY WELL

09:40.948 --> 09:42.082
IGNORE
A RESURRECTION.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.817
SISTER, THEN YOU ADMIT
THERE MIGHT BE

09:43.851 --> 09:46.053
A THEOLOGICAL REASON
TO ATTEND A CONCERT.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.255
I DON'T SEE
WHAT THAT HAS TO DO
WITH ANYTHING.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.257
JUST THAT IT'S POSSIBLE.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.060
MR. FINNERTY,
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
THE RAMONES.

09:53.093 --> 09:56.930
THEY'RE NOT DEAD,
THEY'RE JUST
OVER THE HILL.

09:57.397 --> 09:58.198
OH, COME ON.
I CAN'T EVEN TELL

09:58.231 --> 10:00.333
ROCK 'N' ROLL
HIGH SCHOOL

10:00.367 --> 10:01.735
FROM ROCKAWAY
BEACH.

10:01.769 --> 10:03.103
THEY'RE PRACTICALLY
THE SAME SONG.

10:03.136 --> 10:05.105
NO! THAT'S--NO!
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.073
I MEAN, OK, OK,

10:06.106 --> 10:07.174
GRANTED,
THEY HAVE THE SAME
"ROCK, ROCK" PART,

10:07.207 --> 10:09.710
BUT OTHERWISE,
THEY'RE TOTALLY
DIFFERENT SONGS,

10:09.743 --> 10:10.510
THEY'RE TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

10:10.543 --> 10:11.979
MM-HMM. WELL,
WHAT'S IMPORTANT
HERE

10:12.012 --> 10:14.281
IS NOT HOW
ARTISTICALLY LIMITED
THE RAMONES ARE.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.750
WHAT'S IMPORTANT
IS THAT YOU SEEM
TO HAVE DECIDED

10:16.784 --> 10:20.220
THAT YOU KNOW BETTER
THAN WE DO HOW TO
EDUCATE YOUR SON.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.022
DO YOU HAVE ANY KIDS?

10:22.055 --> 10:25.092
AGAIN, I'M A NUN.

10:25.425 --> 10:26.426
THAT'S MY POINT!

10:26.459 --> 10:28.261
SEE, IT'S EASY
FOR YOU TO BE
ALL HIGH AND MIGHTY,

10:28.295 --> 10:30.831
BUT I HAD 3 KIDS
BEFORE I WAS 25.

10:30.864 --> 10:32.332
AND WHOSE FAULT
IS THAT?

10:32.365 --> 10:33.867
YOURS, YOURS!

10:33.901 --> 10:35.068
I WENT HERE,
TO THIS HIGH SCHOOL.

10:35.102 --> 10:38.739
AND MY SENIOR YEAR,
I WAS FRUITFUL,
AND I DOTH MULTIPLIED.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.941
AND AS I SPENT MY OWN YOUTH
RAISING CHILDREN,

10:40.974 --> 10:42.910
ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT MAKES IT WORTHWHILE

10:42.943 --> 10:45.679
IS THAT I GET TO DECIDE
WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THEM.

10:45.713 --> 10:47.047
NOT YOU, BUT ME.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.016
AND THE RAMONES
ARE ON MY SYLLABUS.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.784
I DON'T LIKE YOUR TONE,
MR. FINNERTY.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.185
OH, YEAH, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

10:52.219 --> 10:53.020
YOU'RE SUSPENDED.

10:53.053 --> 10:56.423
YOU CAN'T SUSPEND ME!
I DON'T GO HERE!

10:56.456 --> 10:58.892
WHICH IN RETROSPECT WAS
A STUPID THING TO SAY

10:58.926 --> 11:02.029
BECAUSE JIMMY
DOES GO THERE.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.032
OR DID.

11:05.232 --> 11:07.367
SO SHE SUSPENDED
JIMMY?

11:07.400 --> 11:08.101
FOR A WEEK.

11:08.135 --> 11:09.837
AND I KNOW
HOW TO FLUSH HIM OUT.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.304
A WEEK, HUH?
MM-HMM.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.006
SO THAT'S WHAT
YOU GET THESE DAYS

11:13.040 --> 11:13.907
FOR ASSAULTING
A NUN.

11:13.941 --> 11:16.810
AH, COME ON, DAD,
I DIDN'T ASSAULT A NUN!

11:16.844 --> 11:17.911
WELL, WHATEVER.

11:17.945 --> 11:19.212
I'M SURE GOD
IS PLEASED.

11:19.246 --> 11:22.315
OH, HO HO! YEAH,
PLAY THE GOD CARD,
RIGHT.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.451
DON'T COME NEAR ME.
HE'S GONNA STRIKE YOU DOWN.

11:24.484 --> 11:25.853
COME ON, DAD,
GIVE ME A HUG.

11:25.886 --> 11:26.887
GET AWAY FROM ME!

11:26.920 --> 11:27.955
I'M YOUR ELDEST!

11:30.824 --> 11:33.226
FIRE!

11:35.028 --> 11:37.397
THE HOUSE
IS BURNING DOWN!

11:37.430 --> 11:40.801
YOU ARE NOT
GOOD PARENTS!

11:43.937 --> 11:47.007
LET'S GIVE IT
ABOUT A MINUTE!

12:04.024 --> 12:07.795
WHAT IS THIS?
YOU CAN'T LEAVE
THESE BOOKS OUTSIDE.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.930
THEY'LL GET
ALL MILDEWY.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.464
WHO PUT THEM
BACK HERE?

12:11.498 --> 12:12.432
I DID.

12:12.465 --> 12:13.366
WALT, WE REALLY
APPRECIATE

12:13.400 --> 12:16.269
THE FREE SET
OF ENCYCLOPEDIAS
FROM THE DUMP.

12:16.303 --> 12:18.071
BUT THE THING IS,
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE

12:18.105 --> 12:19.840
OUR OUTDOOR
ENCYCLOPEDIAS.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.341
WELL, THEY'RE
PERFECTLY GOOD.

12:21.374 --> 12:22.309
THEY'RE FROM 1956.

12:22.342 --> 12:26.479
I'M FROM 1947.
YOU'RE GONNA
THROW ME OUT, TOO?

12:27.981 --> 12:32.252
IT'S TEEMING
WITH SILVERFISH!

12:36.990 --> 12:38.425
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE DIDN'T COME OUT.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.359
THAT SMOKE ALARM
SHOULD HAVE WORKED.

12:39.392 --> 12:43.163
DON'T BLAME YOURSELF.
THE IDEA WAS INSPIRED.

12:43.396 --> 12:44.798
IT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

12:44.832 --> 12:46.033
JIMMY'S AFRAID
OF EVERYTHING.

12:46.066 --> 12:48.401
HE WEARS
HIS BICYCLE HELMET
IN THE CAR.

12:48.435 --> 12:52.072
HE'S--HE'S A WEIRD
LITTLE DUDE.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.475
SO IF I CAN'T
OUTTHINK HIM, AND
I CAN'T SCARE HIM,

12:55.508 --> 12:57.510
WHAT KIND OF MOTHER
AM I?

12:57.544 --> 13:01.849
RELAX, BABY.
YOU CAN ALWAYS
WITHHOLD AFFECTION.

13:01.882 --> 13:04.985
WHAT HAPPENED?
EVERYTHING WAS FINE
YESTERDAY.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.119
YOU GUYS HAD
A GOOD TIME, RIGHT?

13:06.153 --> 13:08.255
YEAH--NO, WE HAD
A GREAT TIME YESTERDAY.

13:08.288 --> 13:11.892
HOO HO! WE HAD
AN EXCELLENT TIME.

13:15.863 --> 13:19.066
ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S
WITH THE "HOO HO!"

13:19.432 --> 13:21.568
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO TALK?

13:22.135 --> 13:23.871
WHAT HAPPENED
YESTERDAY?

13:23.904 --> 13:26.206
NOTHING, NO BIG THING.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.311
YOU SURE YOU DON'T MIND
WATCHING JIMMY?

13:31.344 --> 13:34.181
NO PROBLEM.
NO PROBLEMO.

13:36.549 --> 13:39.552
HOW IS IT
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORK
ON A TUESDAY?

13:39.586 --> 13:41.554
I HAVE
FLEXIBLE HOURS.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.223
ARE YOU A CRIMINAL?

13:43.256 --> 13:44.191
NO.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.894
MY DAD SAYS
YOU SELL BEEPERS
TO DRUG DEALERS.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.162
WELL, NOT KNOWINGLY.

13:49.196 --> 13:50.597
DO YOU SMOKE POT?

13:50.630 --> 13:52.432
SEAN,
GET HER OFF ME!

13:52.465 --> 13:54.067
LILY,
LEAVE EDDIE ALONE.

13:54.101 --> 13:57.337
YOU'RE VERY MYSTERIOUS.

14:01.674 --> 14:02.609
JIMMY.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.377
HEY, YOU READY TO PARTY
WITH YOUR UNCLE EDWIN?

14:04.411 --> 14:06.379
I WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL.

14:06.413 --> 14:07.614
WELL, YOU CAN'T.

14:07.647 --> 14:10.317
HEY, IT'LL BE FUN.
ME AND YOU.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.319
WE'LL WATCH SOME TUBE,
HAVE A BITE TO EAT,

14:12.352 --> 14:13.120
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA
GO INTO BROOKLYN

14:13.153 --> 14:16.323
AND VISIT
THIS DUDE I KNOW, HUH?

14:16.356 --> 14:19.359
I REALLY WANT TO GO
TO SCHOOL TODAY.

14:19.392 --> 14:22.229
HE'S A CHINESE DUDE.

14:22.262 --> 14:25.032
Sean: IT WAS CLEAR THAT
I COULDN'T LEAVE HIM ALONE
WITH EDDIE.

14:25.065 --> 14:28.135
I CALLED MY BOSS TO GET
ANOTHER DAY OFF WORK.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.937
ANOTHER DAY OFF?
BULLDOG!

14:29.970 --> 14:31.604
THIS IS MOTHER-TALKING
BULLDOG!

14:31.638 --> 14:34.141
WHAT THE FLIP DO YOU
THINK THIS IS, FINNERTY?

14:34.174 --> 14:35.475
YOU THINK THE MTA IS--

14:35.508 --> 14:36.509
UH, YOU'RE RIGHT,
SIR.

14:36.543 --> 14:37.644
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?

14:37.677 --> 14:40.914
ALL THE OTHER
MOTHER-TALKERS
GOT THEIR STINK TOGETHER.

14:40.948 --> 14:41.681
INEXCUSABLE.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.216
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU,
FINNERTY.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.118
I'M WATCHING YOU!

14:55.162 --> 14:56.896
HA HA!

14:57.497 --> 14:59.466
HEY, I'M HANGING
WITH YOU GUYS TODAY.

14:59.499 --> 15:00.300
I WANT TO GO
TO SCH--

15:00.333 --> 15:02.235
UH-UH-UH! DON'T SAY
SCHOOL, JIMMY, OK?

15:02.269 --> 15:04.104
'CAUSE THIS IS YOUR
SCHOOL, ALL RIGHT?

15:04.137 --> 15:05.538
WE LIVE IN
THE GREATEST CITY
IN THE WORLD.

15:05.572 --> 15:06.606
LOOK, THERE'S
ALL KINDS OF STUFF.

15:06.639 --> 15:10.944
THERE'S, UH, MUSEUMS
AND HISTORICAL SITES,
THEATER.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.946
SO WHERE ARE
WE GOING, CAPPY?

15:12.980 --> 15:15.215
WELL...

15:22.222 --> 15:25.525
THERE SHE IS, JIMMY.
LADY LIBERTY.

15:25.558 --> 15:26.659
WHO PUT HER HERE?

15:26.693 --> 15:28.528
AH, SHE WAS A PRESENT
FROM OUR BUDDIES OVER
IN FRANCE.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.430
YEAH,
DURING THE FRENCH
AND INDIAN WAR.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.065
THEY PRETENDED
IT WAS A GIFT,

15:32.099 --> 15:33.133
BUT THEN
WE ACCEPTED IT

15:33.166 --> 15:35.402
AND FRENCH SOLDIERS
JUMPED OUT OF HER

15:35.435 --> 15:37.637
AND KICKED OUR ASS.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.307
WHY DO YOU SAY STUFF
LIKE THAT?

15:40.340 --> 15:41.674
I DON'T KNOW.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.276
WHEN OUR FOREFATHERS
CAME HERE,

15:43.310 --> 15:45.278
THAT'S THE FIRST THING
THEY SAW.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.580
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT
THAT MUST'VE BEEN LIKE,

15:47.614 --> 15:49.549
AFTER WEEKS AND WEEKS
AT SEA,

15:49.582 --> 15:51.484
TIRED AND COLD AND HUNGRY?

15:51.518 --> 15:55.155
SWEET JOSEPH, MARGARET!

15:55.188 --> 15:56.689
I CAN'T TAKE NO MORE.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.658
I'LL THROW MYSELF
TO THE SHARKS

15:58.691 --> 16:01.028
BEFORE I ENDURE
ANOTHER NIGHT AT SEA.

16:01.061 --> 16:01.995
AY, SEAMUS.

16:02.029 --> 16:06.433
SEAMUS! WHAT'S THAT
A

16:06.466 --> 16:11.771
'TIS,
'TIS A GREAT IRON LASSIE,
MARGARET.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.240
LORD HAVE MERCY!

16:13.273 --> 16:16.643
LOOK HOW SHE BECKONS US
WITH HER TORCH HELD HIGH!

16:16.676 --> 16:19.512
AY, SEAMUS,
'TIS A BEAUTEOUS SIGHT.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.648
'TIS, 'TIS, MARGARET.

16:21.681 --> 16:25.518
I CAN'T WAIT ANOTHER SECOND
BEFORE I KISS THE GROUND

16:25.552 --> 16:28.288
BENEATH HER
GREAT GREEN FOOT!

16:28.321 --> 16:33.460
WE'RE IN AMERICA,
MAGGIE! AMERICA AT LAST!

16:33.493 --> 16:35.328
ISN'T "LASSIE"
SCOTTISH?

16:35.362 --> 16:37.697
YOU SHUT YOUR GOB, MAN.

16:37.730 --> 16:40.667
THIS WAS FRANCE'S WAY
OF TELLING POOR PEOPLE
TO COME HERE?

16:40.700 --> 16:42.635
SEE? YOU ARE LEARNING
STUFF ALREADY.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.771
THIS IS GONNA BE A BLAST.

16:47.174 --> 16:50.043
I'M GONNA GO
LIE DOWN ON A BENCH.

16:52.645 --> 16:53.746
COME ON, EDDIE!

16:53.780 --> 16:57.217
I'M DEAD!
YOU'VE KILLED ME.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.519
WE TOOK A NICE REST
IN THE HOOTERS,
HUH, JIMMY?

16:59.552 --> 17:02.655
YEAH, DAD.
RIGHT IN HER HOOTERS.

17:04.591 --> 17:06.326
WHOA.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.596
THAT'S IT.
I QUIT SMOKING.
I'M DONE.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.464
RACE YOU TO THE TOP.

17:11.498 --> 17:12.799
OK.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.301
I'LL BE UP IN A SEC.

17:14.334 --> 17:17.404
HOW YOU DOING?

17:18.271 --> 17:21.241
WHOA. COOL VIEW,
HUH, JIMMY?

17:21.274 --> 17:23.643
YOU CAN SEE FOR MILES.

17:23.676 --> 17:24.777
IT'S AMAZING.

17:24.811 --> 17:26.446
THE MAJESTY
OF OUR GREAT NATION

17:26.479 --> 17:28.381
SPREAD OUT AT OUR FEET.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.617
HEY, THE DUMP'S
ON FIRE.

17:30.650 --> 17:33.386
HO HO, THAT'S
GONNA STINK.

17:33.420 --> 17:34.821
YEAH.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.790
LOOK HOW COOL
THE TORCH IS.

17:37.824 --> 17:39.759
YOU WANNA GO UP THERE?

17:39.792 --> 17:40.493
CAN WE?

17:40.527 --> 17:43.396
FREAKING 'A RIGHT!
I'LL RACE YOU!

17:44.431 --> 17:47.367
WHAT'S WITH ALL
THE RACING?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.636
EXCUSE ME,
MAKING OUR WAY
TO THE TORCH.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.238
DANKE SCHOEN.
EXCUSE ME.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.206
MERCI. OK.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.674
WHOA, WHAT--
WHAT'S THIS?

17:54.707 --> 17:57.244
I'M SORRY,
THE ARM IS CLOSED
TO THE PUBLIC.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.211
NO WAY.

17:58.245 --> 17:59.446
WHOA, WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC?"

17:59.479 --> 18:00.780
NOBODY'S ALLOWED
UP THERE.

18:00.813 --> 18:03.283
WHAT DO YOU MEAN NOBODY?
THERE'S THAT COMMERCIAL,
WITH TONY BENNETT.

18:03.316 --> 18:04.351
HE'S SINGING ABOUT
LEMON-LIME SODA.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.653
IT'S OK, IT'S FINE.
WE'LL JUST--

18:06.686 --> 18:07.620
NO, NO, IT'S NOT FINE.

18:07.654 --> 18:10.490
JIMMY, IF TONY BENNETT
GETS TO GO TO THE TORCH,

18:10.523 --> 18:11.558
WHY CAN'T I GO?

18:11.591 --> 18:12.259
IT'S A COMMERCIAL.

18:12.292 --> 18:13.826
OK, LOOK, WHEN YOU
PEOPLE SAID,

18:13.860 --> 18:16.496
LEAVE YOUR BEERS OUTSIDE,
WE DID. RIGHT?

18:16.529 --> 18:19.299
AND WHEN YOU TOLD US
TO STOP YELLING, "ECHO,"

18:19.332 --> 18:20.167
OK, WE STOPPED.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.067
BUT TO DENY US
THE TORCH,

18:21.100 --> 18:23.436
I MEAN, HOW CAN I
EXPLAIN THAT TO MY SON?

18:23.470 --> 18:25.672
I UNDERSTAND.

18:27.340 --> 18:30.677
OK, OK, FINE.
FINE.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.281
SHOULD WE MAKE
OUR MOVE?

18:34.314 --> 18:35.748
LET'S GO.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.385
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:38.418 --> 18:41.621
DID YOU READ THE POEM
DOWNSTAIRS, JIMMY?

18:41.654 --> 18:43.290
WE ARE THE HUDDLED MASSES,

18:43.323 --> 18:46.193
AND THIS GIANT LADY
IS THE ONE PLACE

18:46.226 --> 18:48.595
WHERE FREEDOM
SHOULD REIGN SUPREME.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.464
YEAH, DAD. YOU KNOW,
THERE IS A SIGN.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.200
TO THE TORCH!

18:53.233 --> 18:54.667
AAAAH!

18:56.636 --> 18:57.904
LOOK, THEY'RE STILL
UP THERE, MAN.

18:57.937 --> 18:58.705
THERE'S LIKE
3 OF THEM--AAAAH!

18:58.738 --> 19:01.641
YOU MEAN YOU'RE
NOT EVEN GONNA LOOK?

19:03.376 --> 19:05.578
THAT'S YOUR IDEA
OF "NO BIG THING?"

19:05.612 --> 19:06.713
HOW COULD YOU NOT
TELL ME THAT?

19:06.746 --> 19:08.881
HE'S FINALLY DEVELOPED
A SENSE OF SHAME.

19:08.915 --> 19:10.383
THIS IS REAL PROGRESS.

19:10.417 --> 19:12.519
HEY! I'M NOT ASHAMED
ABOUT ANYTHING.

19:12.552 --> 19:13.853
WE HAD A VALID POINT.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.688
I GOT NEWS FOR ALL
YOU PEOPLE!

19:15.722 --> 19:17.324
THAT'S NOT
THE STATUE OF
LIBERTY,

19:17.357 --> 19:18.725
IT'S THE STATUE
OF OPPRESSION!

19:18.758 --> 19:21.294
FIGHT THE POWER, YO!

19:21.928 --> 19:23.396
SO NOW JIMMY'S
FREAKING OUT,

19:23.430 --> 19:24.597
ALL 'CAUSE
YOU HAD TO GO UP

19:24.631 --> 19:25.532
IN SOME DUMB ARM?

19:25.565 --> 19:27.500
HEY, I'M NOT SAYING
MISTAKES WEREN'T MADE--

19:27.534 --> 19:28.435
YOU TOLD ME JIMMY
HAD A GOOD TIME!

19:28.468 --> 19:30.770
HE DID!
YOU HAVE TO LOOK
AT THE WHOLE DAY.

19:30.803 --> 19:32.239
OH, YOU ARE AMAZING.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.207
'CAUSE YOU COULD
LIE TO ME--

19:47.754 --> 19:48.621
JIMMY?

19:48.655 --> 19:50.257
JIMMY,
WHERE WERE YOU?

19:50.290 --> 19:51.724
SCHOOL.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.660
YOU WERE KICKED OUT
OF SCHOOL.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.428
I SNUCK BACK IN.

19:55.462 --> 19:57.864
YOU RAN AWAY
TO SCHOOL?

19:57.897 --> 20:02.935
YEAH. THEY CAUGHT HIM
IN THE LIBRARY
READING A BOOK.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.637
FREAK.

20:04.671 --> 20:07.274
I NEVER COULD HAVE
FOUND YOU THERE, BUDDY.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.409
JIMMY, COME ON!
WE WERE TRYING
TO MAKE A POINT.

20:09.442 --> 20:10.810
THERE ARE PRINCIPLES
AT STAKE HERE.

20:10.843 --> 20:13.480
YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT LIKE YOU AND
UNCLE EDDIE, DAD.

20:13.513 --> 20:16.316
I DON'T LIKE GETTING
ARRESTED FOR STUFF.

20:16.349 --> 20:17.917
HO HO--WE WEREN'T
ARRESTED.

20:17.950 --> 20:21.321
WE WERE ADMONISHED,
THEN ESCORTED.

20:21.354 --> 20:25.658
WHEN CAN I JUST
GO BACK TO SCHOOL?

20:25.692 --> 20:29.462
OK, I'LL WRITE
ANOTHER NOTE
TO SISTER HELEN.

20:29.496 --> 20:31.498
OH, YEAH, THAT'LL HELP.

20:31.531 --> 20:33.300
A DIFFERENT KIND
OF NOTE.

20:33.333 --> 20:37.870
IT'S ABOUT TIME
YOU APOLOGIZED
TO THAT GOOD NUN.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.307
DROP TROU
AND BEND OVER.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.909
YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT GONNA DO THIS
WITH HIM HERE.

20:42.942 --> 20:46.613
WALT, COULD YOU GO
IN THE OTHER ROOM,
PLEASE?

20:49.882 --> 20:51.684
OK, LOOK! THERE HE IS!
I CAN SEE HIM!

20:51.718 --> 20:54.687
OH, COME ON!
YOU GUYS.

20:58.325 --> 21:00.860
"DEAR SISTER HELEN,

21:00.893 --> 21:04.364
"THOUGH I STILL
CONSIDER YOU

21:04.397 --> 21:06.833
TO BE IN THE WRONG--"

21:06.866 --> 21:08.668
NO!

21:14.040 --> 21:16.609
"THOUGH YOU FAIL--"

21:16.643 --> 21:18.044
NUH-UH!

21:26.052 --> 21:27.987
"DEAR SISTER HELEN,

21:28.020 --> 21:32.559
I AM A FLAMING IDIOT."

21:34.361 --> 21:35.462
THAT I LIKE.

21:35.495 --> 21:36.729
DAD, LEAVE! LEAVE NOW!

21:36.763 --> 21:39.766
COME WITH ME.
PLEASE?

21:45.638 --> 21:46.506
OK, WHICH ONE'S NEXT?

21:46.539 --> 21:48.675
UM, SATURN.
OK.

21:48.708 --> 21:49.742
ALL RIGHT,
THERE YOU GO.

21:49.776 --> 21:52.745
UH, WE'RE GONNA
NEED THE RINGS
FOR THAT ONE. HENRY?

21:52.779 --> 21:54.547
I DON'T
HAVE THEM.

21:54.581 --> 21:56.549
SPIT THEM OUT.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.386
ALL RIGHT.

22:00.152 --> 22:03.690
AND THEN THERE'S OLD
BLUE MARBLE EARTH,
AND THE MOON.

22:03.723 --> 22:05.592
WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED
ABOUT THE MOON?

22:05.625 --> 22:07.460
LET'S SEE...

22:07.494 --> 22:10.363
"SOMEDAY, SCIENTISTS
HOPE TO BUILD A ROCKET

22:10.397 --> 22:11.764
THAT CAN TAKE MAN
TO THE MOON."

22:11.798 --> 22:15.802
ALL RIGHT,
THAT ENCYCLOPEDIA
IS OUT OF HERE.
