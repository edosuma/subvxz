00:01.580 --> 00:03.684
Crosby: I think I'm losing
my business.

00:03.790 --> 00:05.200
Adam: The Luncheonette is like
a weight around my neck

00:05.310 --> 00:07.232
and I want it gone.

00:07.350 --> 00:09.341
Julia: We need to sign
the papers, Joel.

00:09.450 --> 00:11.657
Joel: Is this what you want?

00:14.530 --> 00:16.248
Camille: Look, if he's sneaking
around doing stuff

00:16.360 --> 00:18.453
that's not good for his health,
I have to know about it.

00:18.570 --> 00:19.639
Drew: Can he fly?

00:19.740 --> 00:20.877
Zeek: I trusted you.

00:20.980 --> 00:22.208
You let me down.

00:22.330 --> 00:24.082
Camille: What were you gonna do
in France?

00:24.190 --> 00:26.363
Zeek: I was gonna surprise you
on our anniversary

00:26.470 --> 00:28.256
and I was gonna take you there.

00:28.370 --> 00:30.053
Camille: Well, we could
still go.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.639
We need an ambulance.

00:31.750 --> 00:34.469
I think my husband's having
a heart attack.

[Jesse Marchant's

01:31.120 --> 01:34.009
See it now it is passing you

01:34.120 --> 01:40.332
Plain in the firelight

01:40.440 --> 01:43.477
Nothing new,
just happening again

01:43.580 --> 01:47.858
Stiffened and paralyzed
in the sheets

01:47.960 --> 01:52.613
Don't give me a line

01:52.730 --> 01:55.790
I know the change
when it comes

02:07.470 --> 02:09.870
Pick all your prizes,
get it right

Own the streak

02:12.750 --> 02:16.402
It ain't nothing

02:16.510 --> 02:20.378
And I don't need anyone
to have to explain

02:20.480 --> 02:25.964
To that everyone's got to
carry their own

02:31.910 --> 02:34.663
For whatever ain't done
to you right

02:34.770 --> 02:39.662
And whatever's done
to you wrong

02:39.780 --> 02:42.499
You pull your life
on a chain

02:42.610 --> 02:48.810
Well it all will have passed

02:48.920 --> 02:55.576
And it all will have done
with you what it may

03:11.460 --> 03:12.631
Adam: Okay, okay, so wait,
do we know

03:12.740 --> 03:14.184
that this was definitely
a heart attack?

03:14.290 --> 03:16.326
Camille: No they didn't
say that exactly.

03:16.430 --> 03:17.704
Sarah: But what did Dr. Gordon
say? What did he say?

03:17.810 --> 03:19.152
Camille: I haven't spoken
with him.

03:19.260 --> 03:20.397
Crosby: Well, do you think
it could've been

03:20.510 --> 03:21.579
just heartburn maybe, or--
Camille: I put a call in

03:21.680 --> 03:23.432
to him.
I just haven't heard back yet.

03:23.540 --> 03:24.643
Adam: I'm gonna call Dr. Gordon.
I'm gonna call him right now.

03:24.750 --> 03:26.092
Sarah: Who's in charge then?
Who's giving us

03:26.200 --> 03:28.054
any information?
Hi.

03:28.170 --> 03:29.683
Julia: Hi. What's happening?
Sarah: I tried, I was calling...

03:29.790 --> 03:31.269
Camille: Well,
we don't know yet.

03:31.380 --> 03:32.404
Julia: Okay. Is he okay?
Sarah: It's a lot of

03:32.520 --> 03:34.033
we don't know.
Camille: Of course he's okay.

03:34.140 --> 03:35.277
He's your father.

Yeah, this is Adam Braverman.

Ah...it's the security company
that handles the Luncheonette.

03:42.460 --> 03:43.904
Crosby: What's going on?
Adam: The alarm went off.

03:44.010 --> 03:45.045
Should we have them send
a patrol car over there?

03:45.150 --> 03:47.425
We've had some false alarms.
What do you wanna do?

03:47.530 --> 03:48.770

Adam: Just have 'em send a car?

want you kids to see me
like this.

04:20.320 --> 04:24.154
Camille: We don't know
that it's okay.

Oh, Adam. It was bad.

04:27.050 --> 04:29.701
It was really bad.

make it through this.

absolutely no way

we can go down there right now,
so do you think maybe you could

06:18.060 --> 06:20.199
ask them to lock the doors when
they leave and we'll...

06:20.310 --> 06:21.402
Okay.

your father's history.

hospital coffee is so...

Joel: Double soy latte,

08:43.900 --> 08:45.720
is that still your drink?
Camille: It is still my drink.

09:41.820 --> 09:45.096
Drew: It's fine.
Hank: Now, obviously, I mean...

09:45.200 --> 09:46.929
like in general.

09:47.030 --> 09:49.169
School and whatever.
Drew: Yeah, it's fine.

09:49.270 --> 09:52.091
Yeah, it's fine.
Hank: Yeah. Okay. Good.

09:52.210 --> 09:55.680
We're gonna get there--I got
the whole thing Mapquested,

09:55.800 --> 09:58.485
so we're gonna get there
on time.

09:58.590 --> 10:02.242
I mean, in time for...

10:02.360 --> 10:04.112
I mean, just mean in a quick
time we're gonna get there.

10:04.220 --> 10:06.142
We're not gonna get lost.
Drew: Yeah.

10:08.910 --> 10:10.252
Hank: Car wouldn't start, huh?

10:10.360 --> 10:12.749
Drew: Nope.
Hank: Yeah.

10:12.850 --> 10:15.159
Drew: I'm sorry, I can't--
can we just not talk?

10:15.260 --> 10:18.229
Hank: Oh, yeah. All right,
don't talk. Yeah.

10:18.340 --> 10:19.853
That's what I should--that was
my first instinct

10:19.960 --> 10:22.645
was not to talk to you.

10:22.760 --> 10:25.786
Should've went with that.

10:25.900 --> 10:27.959
I'm good, I-I like...

10:28.070 --> 10:30.413
I'm very good at not talking.

10:34.250 --> 10:36.218
Dr. Lewis: Mrs. Braverman?
Camille: Yes.

10:36.320 --> 10:38.379
Dr. Lewis: I'm Dr. Lewis.
I've been treating your husband.

10:38.490 --> 10:39.809
Camille: Yes.

10:39.910 --> 10:42.049
Dr. Lewis: He's stabilized.

10:42.150 --> 10:43.799
Sarah: Well, what happened? Did
he have a heart attack again?

10:43.910 --> 10:45.184
Dr. Lewis: Yes, he did have
a heart attack.

10:45.290 --> 10:47.326
And we were able to stabilize
his irregular heartbeat

10:47.430 --> 10:49.193
but he's not out
of the woods yet.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.779
All right, he's strong enough
now, so I feel it's safe

10:50.890 --> 10:52.949
to transfer him to the ICU.

10:53.060 --> 10:55.620
I spoke to Dr. Gordon, who will
see him once he's in the ICU

10:55.720 --> 10:57.164
to talk about next steps.
Crosby: Well, if you

10:57.270 --> 10:58.714
stabilized him,
what next steps are there?

10:58.830 --> 11:00.161
Camille: Not surgery?

11:00.280 --> 11:01.304
Dr. Lewis: It's too early
to say.

11:01.410 --> 11:02.445
Once Dr. Gordon sees him,

11:02.550 --> 11:03.756
he can talk to you about a plan.

11:03.870 --> 11:05.030
But Dr. Gordon is
the best there is.

11:05.140 --> 11:07.415
You're in very good hands.
Camille: Okay.

11:07.520 --> 11:08.896
Julia: Can we see him?

11:09.010 --> 11:10.147
Dr. Lewis: Well, we need to get
him into the ICU first.

11:10.250 --> 11:11.319
All right, there's a room
available,

11:11.420 --> 11:12.808
we just need to wait for him
to transfer in.

11:12.910 --> 11:14.559
It's gonna be a couple hours.

11:14.670 --> 11:16.353
[pager beep]
I'm sorry.

11:16.460 --> 11:18.257
This is me, I've got to go.
Adam: Uh, uh, I'm sorry.

11:18.360 --> 11:20.499
A couple hours?
What does all that mean?

11:20.610 --> 11:22.111
Dr. Lewis: It means we're doing
everything we can.

11:22.230 --> 11:23.913
Adam: All right.

11:24.020 --> 11:26.329
Camille: Sweetie, why don't you
and Crosby go to the studio?

11:26.440 --> 11:27.884
Adam: No, Mom, I'm gonna stay
here with you.

11:27.990 --> 11:29.605
Camille: No, I'm okay.
Julia's here. Sarah's here.

11:29.720 --> 11:30.926
I'm--I'm fine. Really, go.
Adam: You sure?

11:31.030 --> 11:32.304
Camille: Oh, absolutely.
Adam: All right.

11:32.410 --> 11:35.163
Hey, Cros, let's check in on
The Luncheonette.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.236
Crosby: Oh, yeah,
that'll--that'll be uplifting.

11:37.350 --> 11:39.898
Camille: Just a couple hours.
Julia: Good luck, guys.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.389
Adam: All right, we'll be back.

11:48.430 --> 11:51.729
Crosby: Oh, my God.

11:55.990 --> 11:57.742
Oh, my God.
Adam: I'm gonna go check

11:57.850 --> 12:00.125
the office.
Crosby: The drums are gone?

12:37.060 --> 12:39.642
Drew: Hey. Hey. Mom.
Sarah: Hi.

12:39.750 --> 12:40.990
Drew: How is he?

12:41.100 --> 12:42.260
Sarah: He's hanging in there,
honey.

12:42.380 --> 12:43.711
How are you?
What happened to the car?

12:43.830 --> 12:45.138
Drew: I'm okay.
It just didn't start.

12:45.240 --> 12:47.174
Sarah: Oh, gosh.
Thank you so much.

12:47.280 --> 12:50.693
Hank: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Drew: Hey, you guys.

12:50.800 --> 12:54.099
Hank: So should I stay here?
Sarah: Oh--no--it's--we're--

12:54.220 --> 12:55.972
just--I mean--
Hank: Okay.

12:56.080 --> 12:58.071
Sarah: We've got a full house,
and there's nothing to do...

12:58.190 --> 13:01.011
Hank: Joel's here though, 50...
Sarah: Yeah, Joel's here.

13:01.120 --> 13:03.600
Hank: All right, I mean,
I'll... stay for you.

13:03.710 --> 13:05.871
Sarah: Oh, okay. Okay.

13:05.990 --> 13:07.537
Kristina: Hey, you guys.
Sarah: Hey.

13:07.640 --> 13:10.291
Kristina: Camille, hi.

13:10.410 --> 13:11.854
Hank: I could've brought
the bagels too.

13:11.960 --> 13:12.779
We went right by
the bagel store.

13:12.890 --> 13:14.334
Sorry. I should've done that.

13:14.440 --> 13:16.579
Kristina: How you holding up?
Camille: No, it's...fine.

13:16.690 --> 13:17.679
I'm fine.
Hank: I'm gonna say hi

13:17.790 --> 13:19.132
to your mom.

13:19.240 --> 13:20.684
Sarah: Have you eaten anything?
You look so skinny.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.415
Hank: Hey, Camille, hi.
I'm Hank.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.488
We met a couple times.
Camille: Of course. Hank.

13:24.590 --> 13:28.310
Hank: Yeah, yeah. Uh...sorry,
uh, about what's going on here.

13:28.420 --> 13:29.728
Camille: Thanks.
Hank: If you need anything,

13:29.840 --> 13:31.284
I'm--I'm around.

13:31.390 --> 13:33.278
Crosby: Sons of bitches!

13:33.390 --> 13:35.017
Adam: Yeah, I know.
Crosby: I mean, what--

13:35.120 --> 13:37.111
who does that?
Adam: I don't know.

13:37.230 --> 13:40.051
Crosby: Also, rip-off someone
who can afford it, you know?

13:40.160 --> 13:42.253
Take down Wall Street
or something.

13:42.370 --> 13:43.917
Picking on us--
we don't have anything.

13:44.030 --> 13:45.099
Adam: Crosby, just take
a breath.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.781
This is why we have insurance.
It'll be fine.

13:46.890 --> 13:48.881
Crosby: Yeah, the insurance
company's gonna

13:49.000 --> 13:50.991
really help us out.
They're gonna delay payment

13:51.100 --> 13:53.239
for God knows how long and then
they're gonna haggle over

13:53.340 --> 13:55.752
the value of every single piece
of equipment we have.

13:55.860 --> 13:57.134
It's all vintage!
You know they're gonna say

13:57.250 --> 13:58.899
it's worth nothing.
You know they will.

13:59.010 --> 14:00.409
It's the final nail
in the coffin.

14:00.520 --> 14:01.691
Adam: We have a good insurance
policy.

14:01.800 --> 14:05.110
Can you choose a different
metaphor please?

14:05.220 --> 14:07.108
Crosby: Why is all this
happening right now?

14:07.220 --> 14:08.949
Adam: I don't know.
Crosby: Why is Dad in ICU?

14:09.050 --> 14:11.257
Grandma's 94 years old
or something.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.942
She's still going strong
and Dad's in there at 73--

14:14.060 --> 14:14.913
doesn't make sense.
Adam: Cros, Dad is gonna

14:15.020 --> 14:16.089
pull through,
he's gonna be all right.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.986
But just let me deal with
the insurance company,

14:18.090 --> 14:20.149
I'm gonna work it out,
let's just stay focused on Dad.

14:20.270 --> 14:21.817
All right?

14:21.930 --> 14:24.194
Don't worry about it.

14:28.170 --> 14:29.990
Camille: Oh, Amber.

14:30.110 --> 14:32.897
I just remembered. Tonight's
your--your baby shower.

14:33.010 --> 14:34.272
Amber: That's--no, no.
Camille: What?

14:34.390 --> 14:35.698
Sarah: My God, we didn't even
think about--

14:35.800 --> 14:37.244
Amber: We're not, yeah--
Camille: No, you have to go.

14:37.350 --> 14:38.931
Amber: It's not happening.
Camille: Your mom paid for it.

14:39.050 --> 14:40.312
You shouldn't lose all
that money.

14:40.430 --> 14:41.499
Sarah: It's mostly just us
anyway.

14:41.600 --> 14:42.385
Amber: Yeah, Grandma.
Sarah: Just try to see

14:42.500 --> 14:43.979
if we can switch it
to another nIght.

14:44.090 --> 14:45.216
Amber: It's fine.
Hank: I can call the guy

14:45.330 --> 14:46.319
if you want--I can do that.
Sarah: That's okay.

14:46.430 --> 14:47.533
Kristina: I actually know him,
I can call him.

14:47.640 --> 14:49.983
He worked with me on the
campaign and catering and stuff.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.398
Sarah: Yeah. If you don't mind.
Maybe.

14:51.510 --> 14:52.704
Hank: Okay, if you know him,
you do it.

14:52.820 --> 14:53.912
Kristina: I do.
Yeah, I know him.

14:54.030 --> 14:56.021
Sarah: Don't worry about it,
okay?

14:56.130 --> 14:58.405
Kristina: Done. Hey.
Adam: Hey. Any news?

14:58.510 --> 15:00.023
Amber: Hey, what happened?
Kristina: Hi.

15:00.140 --> 15:02.404
Adam: Uh, they took everything.
Crosby: Everything's

15:02.520 --> 15:05.728
trashed and broken.
[overlapping murmuring]

15:05.830 --> 15:06.967
Adam: Nothing to be done
about it now.

15:07.070 --> 15:08.514
Jasmine: Sorry.
Crosby: Yeah.

15:08.630 --> 15:10.860
Camille: Oh, Leland.

15:10.970 --> 15:12.597
Leland, thank you so much
for coming.

15:12.700 --> 15:15.453
Dr. Gordon: Of course, of course
I'm gonna be here.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.972
He's had a pretty bad setback.
Camille: Right.

15:18.080 --> 15:19.490
Dr. Gordon: We're still trying
to pinpoint exactly

15:19.600 --> 15:22.489
what happened. Right now, we're
waiting to see how he responds

15:22.610 --> 15:24.919
to the medical therapy that
we've already given him.

15:25.020 --> 15:27.648
We just want to make sure his
heart, his lungs, his kidneys,

15:27.750 --> 15:30.856
are as strong as possible before
we consider any more treatment.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.302
Camille: What kind of treatment?

15:32.410 --> 15:34.446
Dr. Gordon: Um, it could be
as simple as taking him up

15:34.550 --> 15:36.711
into the cath lab _
and putting some stents In.

15:36.830 --> 15:38.889
Camille: Okay.
Dr. Gordon: But...

15:39.000 --> 15:40.729
if the valve is part
of the problem,

15:40.830 --> 15:43.276
we're probably going to have to
go back in surgically

15:43.390 --> 15:44.721
and repair it.
Camille: Oh--oh, no.

15:44.840 --> 15:46.455
Dr. Gordon: I know. I know.
I wish I could tell you

15:46.560 --> 15:48.482
that everything's gonna be
all right.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.761
We're just going to have to
take one step at a time,

15:50.880 --> 15:53.599
so be patient with us until
we can figure it all out.

15:53.710 --> 15:56.087
He's stable in the meantime.
You can visit him in the ICU.

15:56.190 --> 15:59.227
[soft piano music]

16:03.100 --> 16:09.061
[melancholy singing]

16:09.170 --> 16:10.899
Camille: Zeek?
Zeek: [grunts]

16:11.000 --> 16:13.889
Camille: We're all here.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.888
Adam: You're gonna be okay, Pop.

16:17.660 --> 16:18.934
Crosby: Hey, Dad.

16:19.040 --> 16:24.592
[melancholy singing]

16:35.990 --> 16:39.266
[low chatter]

16:42.760 --> 16:43.749
Julia: Hey.
Adam: Hey.

16:47.070 --> 16:48.719
Adam: It's pretty rough
in there.

16:50.040 --> 16:51.894
Julia: Okay.

16:52.010 --> 16:53.341
Joel: I'll go in with you.

16:53.460 --> 16:54.836
Julia: Thanks.
nurse: I'm sorry,

16:54.940 --> 16:56.760
It's family members only.

16:56.870 --> 16:58.622
Julia: He's my husband.

16:58.740 --> 17:00.594
nurse: Okay. This way.

17:07.230 --> 17:12.406
[breathing machines]
[heart monitor]

17:18.930 --> 17:21.273
Julia: Hey, Pop.

17:23.900 --> 17:26.869
Hey, Joe! and I are here.
[alarm, rapid beeping]

17:26.970 --> 17:28.722
Um...

17:28.840 --> 17:31.479
Julia: Is that--
What's happening?

17:31.600 --> 17:33.318
nurse: Step outside, please.
Julia: Can you--can you just--

17:33.430 --> 17:35.660
Can you just give me--
doctor: What are his vitals?

17:35.770 --> 17:36.737
nurse: He's in V-fib.

17:36.840 --> 17:41.083
doctor: Pull the crash cart.
Charge to 200.

17:43.820 --> 17:45.367
Camille: Zeek?

18:17.260 --> 18:18.466
Julia: They just took Dad
to the operating room!

18:18.580 --> 18:19.979
all: What?

18:20.090 --> 18:21.296
Julia: Just--just now.

18:21.410 --> 18:22.229
He lost consciousness
and then, I don't know,

18:22.340 --> 18:23.568
the machine started beeping
and--

18:23.680 --> 18:24.476
Sarah: What machine?

18:24.580 --> 18:25.717
Crosby: Did he have another
heart attack?

18:25.820 --> 18:27.515
Adam: Used it to shock him?
Julia: I don't know!

18:27.620 --> 18:28.894
Adam: What the hell's going on?

18:29.000 --> 18:30.854
Joel: They took him
to the cath lab.

18:30.970 --> 18:32.449
He had another heart attack.

18:32.550 --> 18:35.383
And then they were able to
normalize his heartbeat.

18:35.490 --> 18:38.209
They had to put stents in him,
so they took him away

18:38.320 --> 18:41.005
so that they could get blood
back to the heart, but...

18:41.120 --> 18:44.669
that's all I know.

18:44.770 --> 18:47.330
But they're on top of it.

18:52.990 --> 18:55.458
Hank: Hey, Drew, what are you,
getting a soda?

18:55.580 --> 18:58.572
Drew: Yeah.
Hank: Cafeteria.

19:05.000 --> 19:09.482
Listen, uh, your grandfather's
gonna be okay, so, you know,

19:11.770 --> 19:15.524
Drew: I think that you don't
actually really know that.

19:15.630 --> 19:17.518
Hank: You looked upset.
Just trying to stay positive,

19:17.630 --> 19:19.769
that's all.
Drew: I just messed up so bad

19:19.880 --> 19:21.666
the other day.

19:21.780 --> 19:24.806
He asked me not to _tell
my grandmother something that

19:24.920 --> 19:26.569
he was trying to plan for her.

19:26.680 --> 19:29.365
And then I just ratted him out.

19:29.470 --> 19:31.404
I think that's it. That's the
last thing he's gonna remember

19:31.510 --> 19:33.990
about me when he's--
Hank: No, no. Drew...

19:34.100 --> 19:36.136
Drew: Yeah, it is, it's like,
he's been there for me

19:36.240 --> 19:39.129
the whole time.
Way more than my dad.

19:39.240 --> 19:40.719
Way more than any of
these losers that

19:40.830 --> 19:43.719
my mom brings around.

19:49.980 --> 19:53.689
Hank: He ain't gonna be thinking
that you, he's...

19:53.810 --> 19:56.529
My daughter could tell me
that she hates me,

19:59.020 --> 20:03.957
If something happens, I'm not
gonna be thinking of that.

20:06.890 --> 20:11.850
I don't know if your Grandpa's
gonna be all right or not but...

20:11.960 --> 20:16.511
I know that I'm a parent, uh,
just like him.

20:16.620 --> 20:19.623
We don't hold on to any
of that stuff.

20:24.840 --> 20:26.523
Drew: Thanks.

20:34.680 --> 20:37.535
Adam: Hey.
Crosby: Hey.

20:37.650 --> 20:39.572
Adam: Just got off the phone
with the insurance company.

20:39.680 --> 20:40.851
Crosby: Oh, yeah?
Adam: Yeah.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.609
Crosby: More great news?

20:42.720 --> 20:45.063
Adam: Yeah, actually, uh, the
numbers really worked out

20:45.170 --> 20:46.512
in our favor. It's a--
Crosby: Really?

20:46.620 --> 20:49.544
Adam: Much bigger payout
than I expected. Way more.

20:49.660 --> 20:52.242
Crosby: Like, we could replace
all the equipment big or...

20:52.350 --> 20:55.456
Adam: Yeah. Yeah.

20:55.560 --> 20:57.448
Crosby: Yeah, or what?

20:57.560 --> 21:01.906
Adam: Well, we can do that or,
um, we have another alternative.

21:02.010 --> 21:05.184
Just--just hear me out.
We could cash out.

21:05.290 --> 21:06.917
Crosby: Cash out?
Adam: Yeah.

21:07.020 --> 21:09.113
Adam: Instead of reinvesting
in the equipment,

21:09.230 --> 21:11.391
we could take the insurance
money and dissolve the busmess,

21:11.510 --> 21:12.738
and after we pay off the debts
we'd still have

21:12.850 --> 21:14.477
some money left over.

21:14.580 --> 21:16.434
Look, Cros, I don't know if
we're over going to make

21:16.550 --> 21:19.269
The Luncheonette profitable
and this way,

21:19.380 --> 21:21.234
you know, we're off scot-free.

21:21.340 --> 21:22.272
And we'd even have enough
left over to

21:22.380 --> 21:23.517
give Amber some severance pay.

21:23.620 --> 21:25.895
But we take the money,
we can walk away,

21:26.000 --> 21:30.380
we can have a fresh start.

21:30.490 --> 21:33.766
Crosby: Wow. Um...

21:33.870 --> 21:35.929
yeah, I mean, I guess...

21:36.050 --> 21:39.941
it makes sense_...it_ seems like
maybe a blessnng In dIngIse,

21:40.050 --> 21:42.735
but it's such a--and so quick.

21:42.850 --> 21:46.434
Yesterday, we had a business.
Now we're talking about--

21:48.090 --> 21:49.409
I'll think about it?

21:49.510 --> 21:50.716
Adam: Yeah, for sure, of course.
I--you know--

21:50.820 --> 21:52.094
I don't want you to do anything
you don't want to do

21:52.200 --> 21:53.781
and, you know, we're partners.

21:53.890 --> 21:56.450
Crosby: Okay.
Adam: So yeah, think about it.

21:56.550 --> 21:57.346
Crosby: Hmm...
Adam: Now we both will.

21:57.450 --> 22:00.578
Crosby: All right.
Adam: All right.

22:00.690 --> 22:01.679
Hey.

22:01.800 --> 22:03.688
[Camille breathing heavily]
- What?

22:03.800 --> 22:05.552
Camille: They put in the stents.

22:05.660 --> 22:07.457
He made it through.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.380
Adam: Oh, okay, good, Mom, good.
Camille: [crying]

22:09.500 --> 22:11.809
Adam: Okay. All right.

22:11.910 --> 22:13.593
You all right? You okay?

22:13.710 --> 22:15.849
Camille: Yeah. He's stable.

22:15.950 --> 22:17.497
Crosby: He's stable.
Camille: He's stable.

22:17.610 --> 22:19.635
Adam: Mm, okay, good.

22:19.750 --> 22:21.570
Crosby: It's okay, Mom.

22:39.180 --> 22:41.626
Zeek: Hey.

22:41.730 --> 22:44.426
Oh, boy.

22:44.530 --> 22:47.567
That wasn't a banner day,
was it?

22:47.670 --> 22:49.490
Adam: Oh, Dad, you're a fighter.

22:49.600 --> 22:52.012
Crosby: Yeah, you're a beast,
Dad. You came through.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.747
Sarah: You kept us on our toes.

22:53.850 --> 22:55.158
Julia: Yeah, that was exciting,
Dad.

22:55.270 --> 22:56.578
Sarah: Mm-hmm.

22:56.680 --> 23:01.128
Camille: Do you wanna rest now?
Zeek: Uh...

23:01.240 --> 23:03.686
No, stay.

23:03.790 --> 23:06.167
Okay?

23:06.280 --> 23:09.443
Camille.

23:09.560 --> 23:11.653
Oh, Cammy.

23:17.080 --> 23:19.457
Crosby: So I climb up the side
of the house, right?

23:19.570 --> 23:22.186
And over the balcony--
I slide in through the window,

23:22.290 --> 23:24.463
I'm trying to be quiet but I'm
three sheets to the wind

23:24.570 --> 23:25.605
and I smell like a brewery.

23:25.710 --> 23:28.178
And when I left I had put
pillows under the sheets

23:28.300 --> 23:29.153
to fool everyone.
[laughter]

23:29.260 --> 23:30.192
Sarah: Classic!

23:30.300 --> 23:31.608
Crosby: And I get undressed,

23:31.720 --> 23:34.473
and I'm sliding into bed
and I feel human skin,

23:34.580 --> 23:36.502
and Dad pops out!
[laughter]

23:36.620 --> 23:38.850
And he goes,
"Expecting someone else?"

23:38.960 --> 23:40.518
[laughter]

23:40.620 --> 23:42.372
Crosby: How long were you
laying there?

23:42.490 --> 23:43.969
Zeek: I don't know,
it was forever, I think.

23:44.070 --> 23:45.697
Crosby: I thought there was
a corpse in the bed!

23:45.800 --> 23:47.836
Zeek: God, the look on your face
though, Cros.

23:47.940 --> 23:49.862
Crosby: [laughs] It scared
the crap out of me.

23:49.980 --> 23:51.663
[knock on door]

23:51.770 --> 23:52.805
Dr. Gordon: Sorry, am I
interrupting?

23:52.910 --> 23:55.595
All: No.
Zeek: Hey, Leland, come on in.

23:55.710 --> 23:56.779
Dr. Gordon: There he is.
Zeek: Oh, man,

23:56.880 --> 23:59.633
I am so sorry about getting you
up so early.

23:59.740 --> 24:02.743
Dr. Gordon: Oh, come on now.
You kidding me?

24:02.850 --> 24:06.297
Zeek: So, uh, how am I?

24:06.410 --> 24:07.980
Dr. Gordon: Um...

24:08.100 --> 24:09.544
it's okay to...talk?
Adam: You want us to leave?

24:09.650 --> 24:10.878
Dr. Gordon: No, no!
It's up to him.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.547
Zeek: We're in this together
here.

24:12.650 --> 24:14.754
Dr. Gordon: Okay, no.

24:14.860 --> 24:16.543
All right, well, look.
We've always been straight

24:16.660 --> 24:18.173
with each other, right?
Zeek: Yeah.

24:18.280 --> 24:21.556
Dr. Gordon: And we tell it like
it is. Okay, first of all,

24:21.660 --> 24:24.311
the stents we put in were
successful.

24:24.420 --> 24:31.280
But your heart, Zeek, is just
not as strong as it needs to be.

24:31.400 --> 24:34.085
You're still getting fluid
backing up into your lungs,

24:34.190 --> 24:37.774
and that's what started all of
this to begin with.

24:37.890 --> 24:42.782
So, um, option one:
we go back in.

24:42.890 --> 24:45.267
We open you up again and we
fix the valve.

24:45.380 --> 24:48.235
Replace the damn thing if we
have to.

24:48.340 --> 24:49.750
The problem is you're not as
strong as you were

24:53.110 --> 24:57.035
Opening you back up again could
be a very dangerous thing.

25:00.080 --> 25:03.140
Zeek: Okay, uh, so what
if I don't do anything?

25:03.260 --> 25:05.637
Dr. Gordon: Well,
then you run the risks.

25:05.740 --> 25:10.154
Another heart attack.
Or blood clots. Or a stroke.

25:10.260 --> 25:13.195
Aneurysm.
Zeek: All right...

25:13.300 --> 25:16.428
Okay, so, I've got a couple
of options and

25:16.540 --> 25:18.929
neither one of them sound pretty
good to me.

25:19.030 --> 25:23.239
Dr. Gordon: Okay.
Option three.

25:23.340 --> 25:25.797
Take some time.

25:25.900 --> 25:27.686
Rest up.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.688
Talk to the family.

25:29.800 --> 25:31.859
I'm sure you'll have lots of
questions and I promise you,

25:31.970 --> 25:35.007
you will talk about all of them.

25:38.600 --> 25:41.569
Zeek: Okay. Thanks, Leland.
Dr. Gordon: Yeah.

25:44.500 --> 25:46.149
Jasmine: Hey, we were looking
for you.

25:46.260 --> 25:49.957
Crosby: Hey. Yeah, I needed to
take a minute.

25:50.060 --> 25:51.539
Jasmine: I bet.

25:51.650 --> 25:54.232
He's gonna pull through, baby.

25:54.340 --> 25:55.989
I know he will.

25:56.100 --> 25:57.613
Crosby: You should've heard what
they were saying in there.

25:57.720 --> 26:01.235
It was...far from positive.

26:07.910 --> 26:09.935
_ Adam talked to
the Insurance company and--

26:10.050 --> 26:12.518
Jasmine: Really?
Crosby: Looks like they're gonna

26:12.640 --> 26:14.494
give us a big ol' check.

26:14.600 --> 26:16.739
Jasmine: Oh, that's fantastic.

26:16.850 --> 26:19.011
Crosby: Yeah.
Jasmine: That's good.

26:19.120 --> 26:21.293
Crosby: Yeah...

26:21.400 --> 26:23.334
he thinks we should take the
money and just keep it, move,

26:23.440 --> 26:24.987
and break our lease.

26:25.100 --> 26:27.409
Pay off our debts, he thinks we
can both walk away

26:27.510 --> 26:30.855
with like 20 grand even after
giving Amber some money.

26:30.960 --> 26:33.019
Jasmine: Mmm...
Crosby: Shut up shop.

26:33.140 --> 26:34.823
Jasmine: Hmm...

26:34.930 --> 26:36.818
Crosby: We could take the kid
to Hogwarts.

26:36.940 --> 26:42.549
And I could get a job a Bawiew,
they're always calling.

26:42.670 --> 26:48.631
It'd be a lot of pressure off
me and us.

26:48.740 --> 26:50.708
Jasmine: It would.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.459
Crosby: He thinks it's
a no-brainer.

26:52.570 --> 26:55.050
Jasmine: Hmm.

26:55.160 --> 26:56.957
What do you think?

27:00.890 --> 27:04.826
Crosby: I think it's been a
really stressful year

27:04.930 --> 27:08.229
and the idea of not having any
stress right now

27:08.350 --> 27:10.682
sounds pretty good.

27:10.800 --> 27:13.382
Jasmine: Okay.

27:13.490 --> 27:16.971
Crosby: What do you think?

27:17.080 --> 27:20.868
Jasmine: I think I'll support
you no matter what.

27:20.980 --> 27:24.905
But you've already tried working
for other people

27:25.020 --> 27:29.536
and you were miserable.
And I don't want that.

27:29.640 --> 27:32.200
The Luncheonette,
that made you happy.

27:32.300 --> 27:33.881
That was your dream.

27:33.990 --> 27:36.788
And you can't let these jerks
that broke in

27:36.890 --> 27:39.859
or some slow months of business
or even Adam

27:39.960 --> 27:42.849
take that away from you.

27:42.970 --> 27:44.619
Life is short, baby.

27:44.730 --> 27:47.039
You gotta hang in there.

27:57.570 --> 27:59.902
Drew: Hey, can I sit down?

28:00.020 --> 28:03.911
Hank: Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sit.

28:10.550 --> 28:13.951
That Joel.
He's, like...

28:14.070 --> 28:16.823
not even married
and he's the perfect husband.

28:16.930 --> 28:19.967
Right? He brings coffee,
he knows the medical jargon,

28:20.070 --> 28:21.753
he's...

28:21.870 --> 28:24.009
I mean, he's in pretty good
shape.

28:24.110 --> 28:26.795
He doesn't even eat well, I saw
him at the candy thing he--

28:26.910 --> 28:28.047
he was getting Twizzlers.

28:28.150 --> 28:31.005
So it's not like
he's a health guy.

28:31.120 --> 28:34.942
And I don't even hate him for
it, he's a good guy.

28:35.050 --> 28:38.019
I'm sorry, man.
I'm ranting.

28:38.130 --> 28:40.985
I do that. I just rant when I
get nervous. I just, uh--

28:41.090 --> 28:43.024
Drew: It's fine, I don't care.

28:43.130 --> 28:48.193
Hank: I'm just a little--I'm not
that--I'm nervous--I'm just--

28:48.310 --> 28:52.030
I'm just--I just, I wanna be
there for your mom.

28:52.140 --> 28:55.894
I don't wanna be, uh, one of
the losers and--

28:56.010 --> 28:57.341
uh, I'm sorry, look, this is not
your problem.

28:57.450 --> 28:59.554
Why am I even talking?
Just tell me to shut up.

28:59.660 --> 29:02.902
You can--look, I know I'm an
adult but you can just--

29:03.010 --> 29:06.116
smack me or punch me in the
neck, anything you wanna do.

29:06.220 --> 29:08.871
Kick me in the slacks.
I don't care.

29:08.980 --> 29:11.699
Drew: I'm really sorry about
that--saying the thing

29:11.810 --> 29:13.983
about the losers.
I don't mean that.

29:14.090 --> 29:16.604
I'm serious. I was just stressed
and really upset

29:16.720 --> 29:20.611
about everything and--
Hank: I appreciate it. Thanks.

29:20.720 --> 29:25.020
Drew: You know,
I really like you a lot.

29:25.140 --> 29:29.827
Probably my favorite guy that
my mom's brought around.

29:29.940 --> 29:32.829
Hank: [laughs]
I'm your favorite? I guess--

29:32.940 --> 29:34.316
I'm your favorite loser of
all those ones.

29:34.420 --> 29:36.240
Drew: Yeah. You're my favorite
loser, that's--

29:36.360 --> 29:37.839
Hank: I'll take that.

29:37.940 --> 29:38.872
Drew: I didn't wanna say it.
Hank: I'll take that.

29:38.980 --> 29:40.254
With Joe! standing there.

29:40.360 --> 29:43.944
I'||--I'|| take that.

29:44.050 --> 29:46.257
Drew: Thanks for driving me.

29:46.370 --> 29:50.579
Really. you didn't have
to do that. And...

29:50.680 --> 29:52.989
thanks for just being around.

29:53.100 --> 29:56.228
Hank: Well...yeah.
Yeah, Drew.

30:16.090 --> 30:20.561
Kristina: Hey.
Adam: Hey.

30:20.680 --> 30:22.329
Kristina: Whatcha doing?

30:22.440 --> 30:24.499
Adam: Reading about
cardiomyopathy.

30:24.610 --> 30:26.601
Just wanna _make sure
we're not missmg anything.

30:26.720 --> 30:28.233
Kristina: Honey?
Adam: Yep?

30:28.340 --> 30:30.262
Kristina: Why don't we turn
this off...okay?

30:30.380 --> 30:32.098
Adam: All right.
Kristina: Seriously...

30:32.200 --> 30:33.895
Adam: I'm turning it off.
Kristina: Just take a break.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.820
Adam: Okay.
Kristina: Take a breath.

30:35.930 --> 30:37.795
Adam: All right.
Kristina: Okay?

30:37.900 --> 30:38.992
Adam: It's off.

30:39.110 --> 30:40.930
Kristina: You need to relax
a little bit.

30:41.040 --> 30:44.669
Adam: Thank you.
Kristina: You're--

30:44.770 --> 30:46.931
For what?
I didn't do anything.

30:47.050 --> 30:48.312
Adam: You did.
Kristina: What did I do?

30:48.430 --> 30:51.012
Adam: Just thank you for being
there for me.

30:51.120 --> 30:54.328
And for my family and for
my dad.

30:54.430 --> 30:58.742
Kristina: Honey, you're welcome.
Adam: Thank you.

30:58.850 --> 31:00.465
Hey, how would you feel if
I walked away

31:00.580 --> 31:02.605
from The Luncheonette?

31:04.130 --> 31:06.951
The insurance payout is pretty
good.

31:07.070 --> 31:11.518
Dissolve the business,
take the money.

31:11.620 --> 31:14.032
Figure out what's next.

31:14.140 --> 31:15.619
Kristina: Is Crosby okay with
that?

31:15.730 --> 31:16.867
Adam: I talked to him about it,
he wants some time to think

31:16.970 --> 31:20.690
about it, but I think we're on
the same page.

31:20.800 --> 31:22.427
Kristina:_ You_ built this
together With him, I mean--

31:22.530 --> 31:23.940
Adam: Yeah, I know, but it's--
Kristina: It's a--it's--

31:24.050 --> 31:25.836
I don't want you just to throw
it away because of--

31:25.950 --> 31:26.803
Adam: We're not making
enough money.

31:26.910 --> 31:28.298
Kristina: I know. I know.

31:28.400 --> 31:29.981
Adam: It's like this weight
around my neck that--

31:30.090 --> 31:31.057
Kristina: I know.
Adam: When I thought

31:31.160 --> 31:33.742
that I could let go of it,
it felt so good.

31:33.850 --> 31:36.785
Kristina: Well, if that's the
reason, then yes, I'm on board.

31:36.890 --> 31:37.982
Adam: I wanna let it go.

31:38.100 --> 31:38.748
Kristina: Then we're gonna
let it go.

31:38.860 --> 31:41.328
Adam: All right.

31:41.450 --> 31:43.236
Thank you.

31:43.340 --> 31:44.375
Kristina: Put your phone away.

31:44.480 --> 31:46.038
Adam: Phone's away.

31:46.140 --> 31:49.029
Kristina: Wow.
[both sigh]

31:56.980 --> 31:59.392
Sarah: Hi. Excuse me.

31:59.500 --> 32:01.286
I was looking for you.
Hank: Hey.

32:01.400 --> 32:02.947
Yeah, I just came out for
a little bit.

32:03.050 --> 32:04.779
Sarah: Sorry I disappeared.
I had to do

32:04.880 --> 32:05.915
the vending machine run,
it was my turn.

32:06.020 --> 32:07.749
Hank: Oh wow.
Sarah: Do you want something?

32:07.850 --> 32:09.329
Hank: No, no, no. I'm just--
I'm too--

32:09.440 --> 32:11.362
Sarah: You gotta be so
tired--it's--you should go.

32:11.480 --> 32:13.789
Hank: I'm good, no. I don't
wanna go. I don't wanna go.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.164
I wanna--you know, Joel's here.
Sarah: There's nothing

32:15.270 --> 32:16.680
to do here but wait.
Hank: Joel's staying, so...

32:16.790 --> 32:18.587
Sarah: Don't stay 'cause Joel's
staying. [laughs]

32:18.690 --> 32:21.170
Hank: Well, he's doing
the right thing. He's--he's--

32:21.280 --> 32:23.748
I kinda like Joel. I mean, the
good Joel, not the bad Joel.

32:23.870 --> 32:25.076
Sarah: I understand.
Hank: Yeah, just--

32:25.180 --> 32:26.272
Sarah: All right, well,
I'll see you in there.

32:26.390 --> 32:27.527
Hank: Hold on just for a second,
I wanted to just tell you

32:27.630 --> 32:29.006
what I was thinking because I
know there's a lot going on

32:29.110 --> 32:30.759
in there, and--and--and--

32:30.870 --> 32:34.351
and I saw your father and--
I don't--

32:34.460 --> 32:36.496
it's tough for me to think about
things, you know?

32:36.600 --> 32:38.420
I got a lot of things--I'm
thinking about life

32:38.540 --> 32:40.428
and--and time.
Sarah: Yeah. I know.

32:40.540 --> 32:42.360
Hank: And--and--and--you know--
Sarah: It's being in

32:42.470 --> 32:44.609
this whole place.
In this hospital. It's like--

32:44.720 --> 32:47.780
Hank: Not being afraid though...
Sarah: Count your blessings.

32:47.890 --> 32:49.448
Yeah.
Hank: Doing the right thing--

32:49.550 --> 32:51.586
Sarah: Ifeel like.
Hank: What's good for yourself--

32:51.690 --> 32:53.783
Sarah: Iagree.
Hank: Not being afraid, and--

32:53.900 --> 32:56.061
Sarah: No, that's why we should
probably be vegetarians.

32:56.180 --> 32:57.966
Hank: We should get married,
Sarah.

32:58.070 --> 33:03.098
We should get married.
Yeah.

33:07.220 --> 33:10.940
Sarah: Oh...Hank.

33:11.050 --> 33:14.019
Hank: I--I love you.
And--and--and--

33:14.130 --> 33:17.156
I wanna marry you and--

33:17.270 --> 33:20.785
I want to. I don't wanna be
half-in. Not now and not ever.

33:20.890 --> 33:23.404
I just want to, uh...

33:27.280 --> 33:31.899
I wanna be all in.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.171
You know, you know...

33:34.280 --> 33:37.249
Sarah: I'm just so, um,
surprised.

33:37.360 --> 33:40.045
Hank: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah. I don't know why

33:40.150 --> 33:43.665
I--I can always say things in
weird times, but...

33:43.780 --> 33:48.774
You don't have to...you wanna
bring them the cookies?

33:48.880 --> 33:50.700
We don't--we don't have to--

33:50.820 --> 33:54.199
Sarah: No, Ijust--
Hank: I mean, if it's a no...

33:54.300 --> 33:59.920
Then, uh, you know...

34:00.030 --> 34:02.965
Is it a no?

34:03.070 --> 34:06.176
Sarah: Let's--let's talk later.

34:06.280 --> 34:07.827
Hank: All right.

34:07.940 --> 34:10.864
We'll talk about it then.

34:10.970 --> 34:13.859
At a better time.
Sarah: Yes. Thank you.

34:13.980 --> 34:15.902
That would be great.
Hank: Yeah?

34:16.010 --> 34:18.114
Sarah: Yeah.
Hank: All right.

34:18.220 --> 34:20.154
Sarah: Okay.

34:21.950 --> 34:24.259
Hank: All right.
Sarah: Okay.

34:31.690 --> 34:33.920
Hank: Hey. I just proposed.
[chuckles]

34:34.030 --> 34:35.372
nurse: Oh, well,
congratulations.

34:35.480 --> 34:37.471
Hank: Yeah...yeah, well,
thank you.

34:37.590 --> 34:40.753
We're gonna talk about it.
We're gonna talk about it.

34:40.870 --> 34:42.098
It's like a maybe.

34:42.210 --> 34:43.962
Nurse: Oh...well.
Hank: But thank you, thank you.

34:44.080 --> 34:45.763
Yeah, thanks.

34:48.430 --> 34:50.830
You're doing a good job,
by the way!

35:00.200 --> 35:02.259
Zeek: Ah, Millie.

35:02.370 --> 35:05.544
It's a terrible thing to put you
through.

35:05.650 --> 35:07.470
I'm so sorry I scared you
like that.

35:07.580 --> 35:11.095
Camille: Yeah. It was about as
scared as I've ever been.

35:11.210 --> 35:13.417
Zeek: Yeah.

35:13.520 --> 35:16.068
I mean, my God, Millie.

35:16.180 --> 35:18.831
How the hell
did we end up here?

35:21.360 --> 35:23.874
I mean, don't you wish we'd just
go back a couple years?

35:23.980 --> 35:28.349
Just, you know, you and me
that--

35:28.470 --> 35:32.429
have some fun, you know?

35:32.540 --> 35:37.534
Camille: We'll do it again.

35:37.650 --> 35:40.813
Zeek: I'm _not sure about this
operation thing, MIllIe.

35:40.930 --> 35:42.545
Camille: Well, we don't have to
be sure about it.

35:42.650 --> 35:44.993
You heard the doctor.
We'll take time, you know?

35:45.100 --> 35:47.546
We'll talk about it, we'll
decide, we'll talk to the kids--

35:47.660 --> 35:54.316
Zeek: No. No I don't want the
kids involved in this.

35:54.420 --> 35:59.426
We'll make the decision,
you and me.

36:04.610 --> 36:07.431
Camille: [choking up] Okay.
Zeek: Okay? Yeah.

36:09.750 --> 36:12.503
[knock on door]

36:12.610 --> 36:14.646
Camille: Oh.
Zeek: Oh, hey, guys.

36:17.070 --> 36:20.540
Hi. Hi, Amber.
Amber: Hi.

36:20.660 --> 36:22.480
Zeek: Hi, honey.
Amber: Hey, is this okay?

36:22.590 --> 36:25.627
Zeek: Yeah. Hi, sweetheart.

36:28.730 --> 36:32.837
How are you?
You feeling all right?

36:32.940 --> 36:35.568
Oh, my gosh.
[Amber chuckles]

36:35.670 --> 36:37.183
Amber: How you doing?
You all right?

36:37.290 --> 36:40.635
Zeek: Yeah. Yeah, I feel like
a million bucks.

36:40.750 --> 36:44.151
Amber: You look great.
Never better.

36:44.270 --> 36:47.057
Zeek: Hey, come here. Hi.
Drew: Grandpa.

36:47.170 --> 36:49.479
Zeek: Grandson.

36:49.580 --> 36:52.515
Drew: I love you, Grandpa.

36:52.620 --> 36:54.827
Zeek: I love you too, kid.

36:56.930 --> 36:58.306
Joel: Well, I don't know,

36:58.420 --> 37:01.344
I guess outside of a hospital
is romantic.

37:01.460 --> 37:02.347
Hank: Yeah.
Joel: In a way.

37:02.460 --> 37:04.075
Hank: It's a little weird, yeah.

37:04.180 --> 37:07.661
Well, you know, even--even when
there's a right time

37:07.770 --> 37:14.039
to say something, I usually
don't, so I just figured,

37:14.160 --> 37:17.129
you know what,
I'm just gonna do it.

37:17.230 --> 37:19.266
Joel: And she didn't say no.

37:19.370 --> 37:20.439
Hank: Not yet.

37:20.540 --> 37:22.599
Joel: That's big.
Hank: Yeah.

37:22.720 --> 37:23.402
We'll see.

37:23.510 --> 37:24.886
Joel: Good luck to us.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.059
Hank: Yeah, man.

37:27.170 --> 37:29.161
Cheers to that.

37:29.280 --> 37:30.656
Crosby: Worst day ever.

37:30.760 --> 37:33.376
Adam: Eh, I've had worse.
Crosby: You've had worse?

37:33.490 --> 37:35.867
Have you fallen off a building
or something?

37:35.970 --> 37:37.005
Kept that a secret?

37:37.110 --> 37:38.623
Adam: It was pretty bad.

37:38.730 --> 37:41.073
Crosby: You know what
I'm gonna do?

37:41.180 --> 37:43.808
I'm buying a Lamborghini.

37:43.910 --> 37:46.083
Adam: Lamborghini?
Crosby: That is correct.

37:46.190 --> 37:49.421
Because I promise you one day,
we're gonna look back

37:49.540 --> 37:52.088
on this day,
and we're gonna be laughing.

37:52.200 --> 37:54.430
At the day that our Dad
almost died

37:54.540 --> 37:56.576
and that The Luncheonette
was robbed.

37:56.680 --> 37:59.240
Because Dad's gonna be fine,
and we're not gonna have

37:59.340 --> 38:01.137
any money problems.
And I'm gonna be driving

38:01.240 --> 38:05.791
A Lamborghini Huracan--I don't
know what your dream car is.

38:05.900 --> 38:08.824
Adam: Uh...I like that
Porsche Cayenne.

38:08.940 --> 38:09.861
Hybnd.

38:09.970 --> 38:11.551
[Crosby laughs]

38:11.660 --> 38:12.763
What?

38:12.870 --> 38:14.485
It's practical. You put the
family in there.

38:14.600 --> 38:17.251
It's easy on the environment,
but it's a Porsche.

38:17.360 --> 38:18.384
Crosby: You're right that
it's practical.

38:18.500 --> 38:20.218
It's practically not a Porsche.

38:20.330 --> 38:22.298
But, regardless, fine,
you're in a Cayenne.

38:22.400 --> 38:25.119
Adam: Porsche Cayenne.
Crosby: I'm in a Lambo.

38:25.230 --> 38:28.438
The point is...

38:28.540 --> 38:30.576
I've thought it over and I don't
want to cash out

38:30.680 --> 38:32.853
with this insurance money.

38:32.960 --> 38:35.064
I don't think that's right.
I think, you know,

38:35.170 --> 38:37.786
when we started that company we
were at zero and we took it

38:37.900 --> 38:40.232
somewhere amazing and now we're
not at zero.

38:40.350 --> 38:42.580
I mean, yeah, we've had our legs
taken out, but

38:42.690 --> 38:48.105
between you and I--I just--
I would bet on us.

38:48.220 --> 38:51.075
And I don't think we should let
one rough year break us.

38:51.190 --> 38:53.078
That's not who we are.

38:53.190 --> 38:56.045
We're partners, right?

38:56.160 --> 38:57.673
Partners?

38:57.780 --> 39:00.840
Adam: Yeah. Yeah. Partners.

39:08.960 --> 39:10.541
Sarah: How are you doing?

39:10.650 --> 39:12.402
Amber: Oh, exhausted.
Sarah: Yeah?

39:12.520 --> 39:15.375
Amber: I just wanna go crawl
into bed and sleep

39:15.490 --> 39:16.889
for the next three weeks.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.697
Sarah: All right, well,
before you do that...

39:20.800 --> 39:23.177
I have something to show you.

39:23.290 --> 39:24.279
Amber: I don't like this.
[Sarah laughs]

39:24.390 --> 39:26.767
[overlapping chatter]

39:26.880 --> 39:30.668
Sarah: Here she is!
Amber: Oh, my God, what is this?

39:30.780 --> 39:32.498
Sarah: We couldn't get to the
shower so we brought the shower

39:32.610 --> 39:33.941
to you.
Amber: You didn't have

39:34.060 --> 39:35.630
to do this.

39:35.750 --> 39:37.263
Look at all these embarrassing
pictures of me.

39:37.370 --> 39:39.292
Sarah: I know!
Julia: There's so many.

39:39.410 --> 39:40.889
Sarah: And you have presents.

39:40.990 --> 39:42.548
Amber: Oh, guys, no...

39:42.650 --> 39:44.823
Kristina: Rounded what we could
from--

39:44.930 --> 39:47.205
both: From Pierre's.
[both laughing]

39:47.310 --> 39:49.687
Sarah: We brought all your
presents here and we have

39:49.800 --> 39:53.657
our treats and this book
which we made.

39:53.770 --> 39:56.238
It's a tradition that Mom
started and she made one

39:56.350 --> 39:57.738
for Julia and I.

39:57.840 --> 40:02.493
Each of the moms wrote a page
of advice for you.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.807
And then the rest of the book
IS empty.

40:04.910 --> 40:09.563
And you fill it up with--with
the new, uh, new guy.

40:09.680 --> 40:11.989
[laughter]
You start.

40:12.090 --> 40:14.194
Kristina: Okay. So I'm not sure
how this is going to sound,

40:14.300 --> 40:16.882
because I_was a half a bottle of
wme In. Not qUIte sure

40:17.000 --> 40:18.991
this is going to be--
Amber: That's the advice.

40:19.100 --> 40:20.442
Drink wine.

40:20.550 --> 40:21.892
Kristina: Okay, um...

40:22.000 --> 40:24.719
The thing I would say, Amber,
about motherhood

40:24.830 --> 40:29.244
is that you're going to get
curve balls thrown at you.

40:29.350 --> 40:30.999
A lot of curve balls.
And sometimes,

40:31.110 --> 40:35.114
they're gonna make you want to
run and hide, or despair...

40:35.220 --> 40:40.089
My wisdom for you is to embrace
those curve balls

40:40.190 --> 40:42.750
and own them.

40:42.850 --> 40:45.648
And I know in my heart that
you're gonna be the best mom in

40:45.750 --> 40:48.605
the whole world. Because you're
the best kid in the world.

40:48.720 --> 40:51.097
Julia: I know you're going to be
a wonderful mother.

40:51.200 --> 40:55.307
Because you're so smart
and funny and wise,

40:55.410 --> 40:58.106
and you have a huge heart.

40:58.210 --> 41:00.519
And I know you'll do right by
your child.

41:00.630 --> 41:03.895
But you also have to do right
by yourself.

41:04.010 --> 41:08.117
A huge part of being a mom
is--is being a good role model.

41:08.220 --> 41:09.869
So what I'll say to you is,

41:09.980 --> 41:12.631
don't ever give up on
your own dreams.

41:12.740 --> 41:14.605
And don't let anybody tell you
that you can't do it all,

41:14.710 --> 41:15.631
because we can.
Jasmine: I've always loved

41:15.740 --> 41:17.742
and admired what a proud person
you are.

41:17.850 --> 41:19.772
You're so independent
and strong.

41:19.890 --> 41:21.881
But I just want you to make sure
that you don't ever feel

41:21.990 --> 41:25.198
too proud to come to me
or your mom or any of us.

41:25.310 --> 41:27.619
Because we're here for you.

41:27.720 --> 41:30.473
And we wanna help you.
So don't ever hesitate to

41:30.590 --> 41:33.229
pick up the phone.

41:33.350 --> 41:36.478
[low chatter, laughter]

41:36.590 --> 41:38.694
Sarah: Amber...

41:43.390 --> 41:46.211
Forget it.
No matter what...

41:46.330 --> 41:50.187
I will always have your back.

41:52.470 --> 41:54.438
Amber: I know.

41:54.540 --> 41:59.989
Camille: Amber...
I would say to you

42:00.100 --> 42:03.922
that life is short.

42:04.030 --> 42:09.559
You cannot know how impossibly
fast it goes by.

42:09.660 --> 42:14.381
So...just enjoy this baby.

42:14.490 --> 42:17.869
Cherish this time.

42:17.980 --> 42:22.428
Cherish every minute of it.

42:22.540 --> 42:27.568
In my eyes

42:27.680 --> 42:33.619
In my eyes

42:33.720 --> 42:42.753
My eyes
