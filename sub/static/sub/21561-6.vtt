WEBVTT

00:01.796 --> 00:03.250
I'll explain it one more time.

00:03.729 --> 00:05.710
Look, Admiral, it is right there.

00:06.304 --> 00:08.518
It is right there in that blank box.

00:08.820 --> 00:11.225
What exactly am I supposed
to be seeing there?

00:11.355 --> 00:13.857
It's as clear as a bell.
It's the answer, the key,

00:13.890 --> 00:15.314
the eye of the hurricane.

00:15.687 --> 00:18.781
The proverbial missing link to my formula

00:18.960 --> 00:21.348
to save this planet
lies within those seeds.

00:21.719 --> 00:23.379
Without those seeds, I have no product.

00:23.479 --> 00:25.582
Without the product, your
country continues to starve.

00:25.606 --> 00:27.586
And that is exactly, Admiral,

00:27.686 --> 00:30.946
what you should be
seeing in that blank box.

00:33.218 --> 00:35.252
Doctor, I am a simple man.

00:35.458 --> 00:37.078
I don't have your gift with figures,

00:37.178 --> 00:38.838
but my patience can only last so long.

00:38.938 --> 00:41.758
You asked for our support.
Greece gives you her confidence.

00:42.144 --> 00:44.480
You asked for fighters,
we give you a warship.

00:45.290 --> 00:48.832
What, Dr. Vellek? What do
you ask of my country now?

00:50.317 --> 00:53.598
More, Demetrius.

00:55.188 --> 00:58.032
I'm asking your country for more.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.425
...planned out of Israel.

01:28.760 --> 01:30.096
Captain Chandler.

01:30.400 --> 01:33.016
Captain Slattery was just
sharing a bit of good news.

01:33.440 --> 01:34.816
Commander Garnett managed to locate

01:34.840 --> 01:36.300
another plane in Tel Aviv.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.720
She's altered the flight plan
to meet us at Tregua Island.

01:38.800 --> 01:41.160
There's an airstrip there.
It's private, but operational.

01:41.556 --> 01:43.649
But most importantly, unlikely
to be on Vellek's radar.

01:43.673 --> 01:46.163
Turns out, Aegis Ashore
was a good call, Captain.

01:46.188 --> 01:48.176
Thank you for that. We're not
taking any chances with this plane,

01:48.200 --> 01:49.460
as it's probably the last one

01:49.560 --> 01:50.976
we'll have at our disposal for some time.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.320
<i>Nathan James</i> will meet the plane.

01:52.400 --> 01:53.880
Ms. Cooper will personally escort the seeds

01:53.960 --> 01:55.829
back to our lab in the States,

01:56.343 --> 01:58.083
where our scientists are standing by.

01:58.384 --> 02:00.780
Rest of us, prepare for phase two...

02:01.886 --> 02:04.345
finding and capturing Dr. Paul Vellek.

02:04.425 --> 02:05.925
Any sign of that Greek warship?

02:06.025 --> 02:07.425
Negative. I think it should stay that way

02:07.505 --> 02:09.285
until the seeds are far away from the Med.

02:09.384 --> 02:11.051
Sounds like a solid plan.

02:11.391 --> 02:13.265
And a special thanks to Commander Fletcher

02:13.290 --> 02:15.513
for his role in helping secure the seeds.

02:15.845 --> 02:17.505
Our nation owes you a great debt.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.627
Feeling's mutual, I'm sure.

02:20.947 --> 02:22.103
That is all.

02:44.727 --> 02:47.439
Synced and corrected by louvette
www.addic7ed.com

03:07.905 --> 03:10.886
Tregua Island? Well, isn't that a riot?

03:11.105 --> 03:14.527
You and I haven't been there
since... When was it last?

03:15.745 --> 03:16.725
'09. Rossi.

03:16.825 --> 03:19.285
That was it. The Rossi mission.

03:19.385 --> 03:21.065
Yes, I'm well aware of your heroics, Harry.

03:21.145 --> 03:22.405
Everyone knows what you did.

03:22.505 --> 03:23.945
Saved your ass more than once, didn't I?

03:28.014 --> 03:30.652
Right, so, let's formulate
a new plan, and quickly.

03:30.677 --> 03:32.278
The timeline has just been pushed.

03:32.322 --> 03:34.782
I still don't understand why
this has to happen at sea.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.737
You do realize how mad that is.

03:36.910 --> 03:39.130
Humanity is wasting away, Fletch.

03:39.441 --> 03:41.330
We both know this is
the Americans' last shot.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.110
That plane will be the most heavily guarded

03:43.190 --> 03:45.010
piece of equipment in the world.

03:45.386 --> 03:47.296
A full assault will be too risky.

03:48.074 --> 03:51.204
And it's crucial the Yanks don't
see the U.K.'s hand in this.

03:52.281 --> 03:54.169
For the... aftermath.

03:59.331 --> 04:00.855
I wonder, Fletch.

04:01.171 --> 04:03.468
Has your time aboard the great ship

04:03.493 --> 04:05.395
<i>Nate Jimmy</i> turned you soft?

04:07.425 --> 04:08.605
And I wonder, Harry,

04:08.705 --> 04:11.025
if months of eating dog
has turned you feral.

04:14.705 --> 04:17.034
The new battle lines have
been drawn, my friend,

04:17.480 --> 04:18.959
and the P.M. has made it crystal clear...

04:19.040 --> 04:21.511
get the seeds by any means necessary.

04:21.798 --> 04:23.459
Now you can procure them for me

04:23.559 --> 04:26.498
and get me off the ship
before she makes port.

04:27.161 --> 04:29.432
Or do some of your friends have to die?

04:30.659 --> 04:33.338
I managed a good look at Miss Sasha Cooper.

04:33.934 --> 04:36.960
She's certainly your type,
and with a brain to boot.

04:38.739 --> 04:41.239
Or maybe it turns out the
captain of the refugee boat

04:41.339 --> 04:44.519
was a pirate after all,
with ill intentions.

04:44.970 --> 04:47.719
He attacked me when I
discovered his true identity.

04:47.819 --> 04:50.879
So I had to put him down like a dog.

04:51.665 --> 04:53.145
No one will doubt me.

04:55.019 --> 04:56.919
They asked me if you could be trusted.

04:58.287 --> 05:00.286
I vouched for you, told them,

05:00.311 --> 05:02.067
"I've known Fletcher longer than anyone.

05:02.219 --> 05:03.799
"Grew up with him, fought with him.

05:03.899 --> 05:04.999
He's the man for the job."

05:05.512 --> 05:07.920
I know you to be a patriot, James.

05:09.070 --> 05:10.650
If the shoe was on the other foot,

05:10.679 --> 05:12.241
do you think any of these
sailors would think twice

05:12.270 --> 05:14.102
before following orders
from their President?

05:17.510 --> 05:19.387
I'll take care of the seeds myself.

05:20.010 --> 05:21.273
You just get me the gear.

05:22.887 --> 05:24.910
You're under orders to call
the home office, I presume?

05:25.010 --> 05:27.691
- To report on the seeds?
- Yes.

05:27.822 --> 05:29.298
Call this number instead.

05:37.328 --> 05:39.028
She's expecting your call.

05:39.908 --> 05:41.028
Got it, Harry.

05:41.127 --> 05:42.136
Do you?

05:43.337 --> 05:44.435
Yes.

05:47.904 --> 05:49.124
Just one last thing.

05:49.224 --> 05:50.684
Jesus. What?

05:51.381 --> 05:53.121
Who does one have to kill around here

05:53.221 --> 05:54.824
to score a decent cup of tea?

06:22.104 --> 06:24.026
Captain Chandler on the bridge!

06:25.210 --> 06:26.550
- Captain.
- Captain.

06:26.650 --> 06:29.310
Still no sign of the Greek
ships on sonar or radar.

06:29.410 --> 06:31.990
We are on PIM to reach
Tregua Island at 2100.

06:32.632 --> 06:34.837
My knees feel bad weather coming.

06:35.910 --> 06:37.210
How's the barometer?

06:37.310 --> 06:39.610
Sir, the system to the
west is growing rapidly,

06:39.710 --> 06:42.090
but if we maintain our
current course and speed,

06:42.190 --> 06:45.148
we should beat it to
Tregua by 3-plus hours.

06:47.870 --> 06:48.926
Thoughts?

06:51.658 --> 06:53.623
More of a conservative hunch.

06:54.685 --> 06:56.161
We've got the window.

06:56.365 --> 06:58.349
Maybe we ride the edge of that system,

06:58.765 --> 07:00.802
use it to mask our signature
from any unfriendlies

07:00.827 --> 07:02.255
who might be in the vicinity.

07:04.760 --> 07:07.008
OOD, new course, 162.

07:07.055 --> 07:09.075
Captain Chandler wants
to get his cover wet.

07:09.100 --> 07:13.062
Aye, Sir. Helm, left standard
rudder steady on course 162.

07:13.615 --> 07:15.355
Helm, aye. My rudder is left 15 degrees,

07:15.455 --> 07:18.391
- coming to course 162.
- I see you found your Cubans.

07:18.567 --> 07:19.415
Yes.

07:20.509 --> 07:22.382
And all is right with the world.

07:22.589 --> 07:25.646
Good to have you back. Both of you.

07:26.137 --> 07:27.634
Beat me to it, Master Chief.

07:31.674 --> 07:34.744
At our current speed, we're
due in Tregua at 2100 hours.

07:35.074 --> 07:38.134
Should be refreshing to see that
little island this time of year.

07:38.601 --> 07:40.614
<i>As all of you know, I've
only been there in spring,</i>

07:40.714 --> 07:43.646
<i>and in less than
celebratory circumstances.</i>

07:44.855 --> 07:46.054
Asteris.

07:46.154 --> 07:48.094
Asteris Island is the drop off point.

07:48.194 --> 07:50.811
We'll have support standing
by to receive the package.

07:51.095 --> 07:52.983
Okay. Right.

07:53.270 --> 07:54.322
Brilliant.

07:55.021 --> 07:57.021
So is there anything else
I can do for you on my end?

07:57.625 --> 07:59.978
You're doing the right thing, Mr. Fletcher.

08:00.341 --> 08:03.510
Soon your people will be
well-fed, thanks to you.

08:04.117 --> 08:07.657
<i>- And to us.</i>
- Very good. Right. Cheers.

08:07.758 --> 08:09.932
I'll be seeing you all very shortly then.

08:10.358 --> 08:11.749
Over and out.

08:14.973 --> 08:17.425
- Thank you, Chief.
- Anytime, Sir.

08:18.577 --> 08:20.194
_

08:20.219 --> 08:21.733
_

08:21.757 --> 08:23.757
_

08:24.616 --> 08:26.716
Call my brother. Let him know where to go.

08:26.816 --> 08:29.476
And gather what your
admiral promised my father.

08:29.577 --> 08:30.781
Once this is done,

08:31.057 --> 08:33.703
I want you to sink <i>Nathan James.</i>

08:37.943 --> 08:39.464
Yes, ma'am.

08:48.323 --> 08:50.823
Wow. There's a sight I
thought I'd never see...

08:50.923 --> 08:53.623
Miller reading a book
without a crayon in his hand.

08:53.723 --> 08:55.343
What you got there?

08:55.443 --> 08:58.823
"Odyssey," man. This shit's crazy.

08:59.627 --> 09:01.847
Didn't get enough of
that in the ninth grade?

09:01.947 --> 09:04.036
I never actually read it in ninth grade.

09:04.467 --> 09:06.185
It's freaking me out right now.

09:06.827 --> 09:07.990
How so?

09:09.743 --> 09:11.718
I don't know, man. This story...

09:12.463 --> 09:13.643
sounds kinda like us.

09:14.116 --> 09:16.936
A bunch of sailors wandering the Med,

09:17.607 --> 09:18.867
monsters around every bend,

09:18.967 --> 09:20.570
people always trying to kill him...

09:21.807 --> 09:23.907
It's like the gods are against him.

09:24.007 --> 09:26.627
Come on, man. How is that anything like us?

09:27.096 --> 09:29.196
Look, we found the seeds
and Captain Chandler.

09:29.296 --> 09:31.436
Pretty soon, we'll be
eating like kings again.

09:31.536 --> 09:33.196
And you still seem to be in one piece.

09:34.319 --> 09:35.396
That's just it.

09:35.965 --> 09:39.476
Odysseus' problems started
<i>after</i> he won the war.

09:40.273 --> 09:44.186
All this mess happened as he
was just trying to get home.

09:53.475 --> 09:55.227
Why you gotta ruin everything, man?

09:55.746 --> 09:57.746
I used to like that book.

10:07.653 --> 10:09.044
- Fever?
- Nope.

10:09.493 --> 10:11.178
- Sweats?
- Nada.

10:11.413 --> 10:13.313
- Heart racing?
- Cool as a cucumber.

10:13.413 --> 10:15.493
But if you keep shining
that light in my eye, Heggen,

10:15.573 --> 10:16.878
things might change.

10:17.417 --> 10:18.925
I think he's back to normal, Sir.

10:18.925 --> 10:20.051
Okay.

10:20.525 --> 10:23.149
Um, in your own words, Sir,
describe how you're feeling.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.741
Pretty good, actually.

10:27.902 --> 10:29.282
Hard to describe.

10:29.382 --> 10:32.374
I have this, uh, sense of inner peace.

10:32.862 --> 10:35.452
Nothing bothers me. I love everyone.

10:35.982 --> 10:37.171
It's terrible.

10:38.410 --> 10:39.557
It's fascinating.

10:39.982 --> 10:41.762
I've been studying the Red Rust's effects

10:41.862 --> 10:43.775
on various commelinids.

10:44.062 --> 10:46.682
Most of them... wheat, rice,
corn... they failed to thrive

10:46.782 --> 10:49.042
once the virus reached the cellular level.

10:49.842 --> 10:53.156
But for this one weed,
the virus turned into

10:53.181 --> 10:55.632
a powerful hallucinogen... Nostos.

10:57.389 --> 10:59.022
Had you been a smaller man,

10:59.022 --> 11:00.564
I doubt we'd ever have seen you again.

11:00.612 --> 11:02.332
Yeah, well...

11:03.381 --> 11:05.665
...there were moments
I didn't wanna come back.

11:07.896 --> 11:09.638
All I can tell say is, Doc, uh...

11:10.675 --> 11:12.516
you had to be there.

11:17.173 --> 11:18.445
- Sir.
- Gentlemen, as you were.

11:27.697 --> 11:30.397
Here he is, England's man of the hour.

11:30.497 --> 11:31.757
Sorry to be a bother.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.057
I just need to grab a few of my things.

11:33.137 --> 11:35.437
Yeah, sure. Help yourself, mate.

11:35.537 --> 11:38.150
Half of this stuff came from
the U.K. in the first place.

11:38.326 --> 11:39.617
Much appreciated.

11:43.297 --> 11:44.673
Hey.

11:51.018 --> 11:52.456
What are you going to do?

11:53.527 --> 11:55.017
Once you reach home.

11:55.945 --> 11:57.198
Can't say for sure.

12:00.680 --> 12:02.124
You are a farmer?

12:03.434 --> 12:04.789
Uh, my family are.

12:05.400 --> 12:06.700
Or they were.

12:06.800 --> 12:09.541
I remember. Mine, too.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.120
Well, if all goes well, they'll
be back at it, won't they?

12:16.882 --> 12:18.142
Yeah. Let's hope so.

12:24.802 --> 12:27.922
Well... cheers.

12:34.815 --> 12:36.797
A good-lookin' bloke, wouldn't you say?

12:37.760 --> 12:39.755
Too pretty for my taste.

12:42.113 --> 12:44.013
I prefer a man who looks like

12:44.113 --> 12:47.370
he has taken a few punches to the face.

12:48.553 --> 12:49.876
Thanks.

12:51.073 --> 12:52.213
I think.

12:55.929 --> 12:58.172
- Chief.
- Commander.

13:11.450 --> 13:12.498
Funny.

13:12.868 --> 13:15.406
You're back on the ship.
Now I'm the one leaving.

13:15.878 --> 13:18.684
Destiny has other plans for us.

13:19.489 --> 13:20.909
At least I'll have plenty of time

13:21.009 --> 13:23.085
to get better acquainted
with Commander Fletcher.

13:23.289 --> 13:24.377
I'll bet.

13:28.448 --> 13:30.928
How much you tell him? About us?

13:31.578 --> 13:32.752
Fletcher?

13:34.062 --> 13:35.674
Only the important stuff.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.464
The rest he can figure out by himself.

13:40.876 --> 13:43.077
Tom Chandler, are you jealous?

13:45.677 --> 13:47.242
Speak of the devil.

13:48.071 --> 13:49.863
And he shall appear.

13:51.100 --> 13:52.342
I'll leave you to it.

13:58.913 --> 14:00.413
Everything all right?

14:00.513 --> 14:01.416
Yeah.

14:02.233 --> 14:03.284
Perfect.

14:05.067 --> 14:06.633
I just got off the phone with England.

14:07.194 --> 14:09.054
I'm afraid we can't count on them

14:09.154 --> 14:10.474
for reinforcements just yet.

14:10.834 --> 14:12.629
I'll be so happy to get
those seeds on a plane

14:12.654 --> 14:13.676
and out of here.

14:16.183 --> 14:17.523
You know what I mean.

14:17.552 --> 14:20.080
Yeah. Yeah, of course I do.

14:22.783 --> 14:25.054
Promise me you'll be careful, James.

14:25.783 --> 14:27.714
You know how dangerous Vellek can be.

14:33.591 --> 14:37.522
I promise I'll be as
vigilant as ever, Sasha.

14:39.680 --> 14:41.016
You have my word.

14:43.079 --> 14:45.183
I wish I could be there
when you take him down.

14:53.013 --> 14:54.993
Surface contact bearing 1-6-5.

14:55.093 --> 14:58.313
- Course and speed?
- 1-4-0 at 12 knots.

15:01.813 --> 15:04.490
Bridge, CIC.

15:04.565 --> 15:07.002
I have a surface contact
shadowing our course and speed.

15:07.081 --> 15:09.581
Bridge, copy. Alpha track bearing 1-6-5.

15:09.681 --> 15:12.701
Radar contact! Two additional
unknowns in company,

15:12.801 --> 15:15.604
bearing 1-6-0 at 5-0 miles!

15:16.690 --> 15:18.208
That makes three all day.

15:18.530 --> 15:19.958
<i>Contact confirmed.</i>

15:19.958 --> 15:22.938
EW parameters on Bravo match
our log of the Hydra class.

15:23.038 --> 15:24.818
Bridge, CIC.

15:24.918 --> 15:26.878
confirming contact Bravo
is the same Greek warship

15:26.958 --> 15:29.098
- <i>we encountered off Sardinia.</i>
- Vellek.

15:29.198 --> 15:30.718
He's found us and he's gathered a fleet.

15:30.798 --> 15:32.818
He won't fire at us
with the seeds on board.

15:32.918 --> 15:34.898
No, but he'll trail us
all the way to Tregua,

15:34.998 --> 15:38.032
take out that plane before it
ever lowers its landing gear.

15:38.470 --> 15:40.448
Gator, find us a spot to hide.

15:40.918 --> 15:42.797
Okay, there's a single island up ahead.

15:42.829 --> 15:44.609
It's small, but if we could get around it,

15:44.709 --> 15:46.229
we could get enough cover to lose him

15:46.309 --> 15:47.989
in the island chain further to the south.

15:48.069 --> 15:48.963
Where?

15:49.589 --> 15:52.109
Here. Asteris.

15:52.429 --> 15:54.616
It's the only other island in range.

15:56.545 --> 15:57.885
How long until we're there?

15:57.985 --> 15:59.936
- About one hour.
- We gotta move.

16:00.006 --> 16:02.306
OOD, come to course 1-7-0, all ahead flank.

16:02.406 --> 16:03.906
- Make for Asteris.
- Aye, Sir.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.906
Helm, come right steady course 1-7-0,

16:06.006 --> 16:07.306
all engines ahead flank.

16:07.406 --> 16:08.806
Helm, aye, coming to course 1-7-0.

16:08.886 --> 16:10.786
All engines ahead flank.

16:18.946 --> 16:20.578
All right, next, please.

16:21.806 --> 16:23.768
- Commander.
- Gentleman.

16:24.069 --> 16:26.069
- Hello, Fletch.
- What's your name?

16:26.949 --> 16:28.569
1800.

16:45.191 --> 16:48.227
I found their HF comms
on an obscure channel.

16:48.332 --> 16:49.772
I've isolated their signals to determine

16:49.852 --> 16:51.452
which ship is communicating and when,

16:51.532 --> 16:53.572
but I haven't been able to
decrypt what they're saying.

16:54.566 --> 16:56.366
Bravo seems to be receiving and emitting

16:56.391 --> 16:57.599
more often than the other two.

16:57.679 --> 16:59.650
Yes, Ma'am. I'm thinking
that's their flagship.

16:59.726 --> 17:03.280
I concur. So now we know
who's calling the shots.

17:03.803 --> 17:05.762
Nice work, Chief. Keep
working on the decryption.

17:05.788 --> 17:07.373
Let's see if we can figure out their plan.

17:07.397 --> 17:08.482
Yes, Sir.

17:10.233 --> 17:12.253
They know we have no
backup here in the Med.

17:12.354 --> 17:13.993
They're either gonna attack us at the LZ

17:14.074 --> 17:16.114
or try to surround us before
we get there, starve us out.

17:16.194 --> 17:17.694
If we don't lose them in the islands,

17:17.794 --> 17:18.993
we're gonna have to wave off the plane.

17:19.074 --> 17:20.434
We can't afford to have it shot down.

17:20.513 --> 17:22.574
How many ships in the
Greek Navy, you reckon?

17:23.258 --> 17:24.553
No idea. Why?

17:24.553 --> 17:26.593
Well, it's obvious we're looking
to hide in the island chain.

17:27.305 --> 17:29.085
And they're pushing us right toward it,

17:29.185 --> 17:31.265
like they want us to go there.
You think they got other ships

17:31.345 --> 17:33.085
waiting on the other side to ambush?

17:33.185 --> 17:34.684
One way to find out.

17:36.345 --> 17:38.165
Lucia! They have changed course.

17:38.265 --> 17:40.565
Now turning away from
Asteris towards open water.

17:40.665 --> 17:42.845
Where the hell does he think he's going?

17:43.725 --> 17:46.332
Order the other ships to
flank him on his port side.

17:46.554 --> 17:48.414
Get him back in line.

17:48.439 --> 17:49.720
Yes, Ma'am.

17:50.192 --> 17:52.031
There's nowhere else to hide!

18:04.555 --> 18:06.275
They've adjusted course 20 degrees to port,

18:06.355 --> 18:08.055
now heading 1-2-0.

18:08.155 --> 18:11.535
No doubt about it, they want us to
round that island. Gator, options?

18:11.635 --> 18:13.595
Sir, we can't continue along
this bearing for much longer.

18:13.675 --> 18:15.755
There's a rocky outcropping of
shallows. It'll tear us apart.

18:15.835 --> 18:17.975
Rocks in front of us, enemies around us,

18:18.075 --> 18:19.615
and a storm closing in from behind.

18:19.715 --> 18:20.935
We're trapped.

18:21.746 --> 18:23.565
You thinking what I'm thinking?

18:24.831 --> 18:26.061
Trafalgar.

18:26.266 --> 18:28.646
Turn and charge, break through their line.

18:29.044 --> 18:30.366
Lose them in the storm.

18:30.466 --> 18:33.571
Never mind the maneuvers, boys.
We're going straight at 'em!

18:35.186 --> 18:37.050
General quarters, general quarters.

18:37.075 --> 18:38.935
All hands, man your battle stations.

18:38.987 --> 18:40.456
Make ready for heavy seas.

18:40.955 --> 18:43.510
Strap in, son. This is
what you trained for.

19:04.268 --> 19:07.278
Lock up. Everything
floor to the engine rooms.

19:11.209 --> 19:13.088
Move. Let's go.

19:29.042 --> 19:30.662
Circle William is set.

19:30.762 --> 19:32.742
I'm trying to get 3 generator to align.

19:32.842 --> 19:34.035
I got it.

19:47.275 --> 19:48.448
Thanks, Chief.

19:48.473 --> 19:51.573
Generators 1, 2, and 3
all parallel to the bus.

19:51.673 --> 19:52.693
Bridge, Central.

19:52.793 --> 19:54.153
I've got three generators available.

19:54.233 --> 19:57.718
Condition zebra set. Time 1721.

19:59.466 --> 20:00.613
Here we go.

20:08.648 --> 20:09.874
_

20:09.900 --> 20:10.830
Lucia!

20:10.906 --> 20:12.646
They're going to charge our line!

20:12.746 --> 20:14.366
They're going to what?!

20:14.466 --> 20:16.486
They're going to try
to lose us in the storm!

20:18.226 --> 20:19.656
_

20:19.680 --> 20:21.680
_

20:28.151 --> 20:31.011
CIC, Bridge. TAO, fire
defensive measures only.

20:31.111 --> 20:32.268
TAO, aye.

20:32.269 --> 20:35.249
Switching weapons to CIWS,
defensive posture ALPHA.

20:38.039 --> 20:40.299
Steady, Helm. Steady.

20:49.670 --> 20:50.839
Stavros!

20:50.889 --> 20:53.216
What do you want me to
do? They have the seeds!

20:54.710 --> 20:56.002
Step aside!

21:01.470 --> 21:04.050
Fire control radar detected!

21:04.150 --> 21:06.690
Closing to within minimum
weapons engagement zone!

21:06.790 --> 21:09.486
Bridge, CIC. Range
1,000 meters and closing.

21:23.913 --> 21:25.478
She won't fire.

21:52.816 --> 21:54.636
He's insane!

21:54.736 --> 21:56.636
Send the other two ships to follow him!

21:56.736 --> 22:00.144
- Into the storm?
- Yes, damn it! Into the storm!

22:29.561 --> 22:31.181
All deck, water tank is dry.

22:32.925 --> 22:35.699
OOD, come to 12 knots.
Make bear steerage way.

22:36.053 --> 22:37.793
Aye, sir. Helm, come to 12 knots.

22:37.894 --> 22:39.954
- Make bear steerage way.
- Helm, aye.

22:40.054 --> 22:42.434
Subsurface, be on the lookout for debris!

22:42.534 --> 22:44.674
Sonar is completely washed out, Sir.

22:44.774 --> 22:47.044
Alpha and Charlie are still on our tail.

22:58.379 --> 23:01.039
We're coming up on another one!

23:01.139 --> 23:02.464
Brace! Brace! Brace!

23:03.259 --> 23:04.740
Hang on. Diaz.

23:09.059 --> 23:10.759
Master Chief!

23:10.859 --> 23:12.619
- I'm all right.
- Captain, we're approaching

23:12.699 --> 23:14.499
the navigable semicircle of the storm now!

23:14.579 --> 23:16.499
If we don't lose them before
the wind shifts, we never will.

23:16.579 --> 23:18.499
Captain, she's pulling hard to
port! I can't hold her steady!

23:18.579 --> 23:20.279
Fuel's already been redistributed.

23:20.379 --> 23:22.093
It's our live ballast!

23:22.339 --> 23:24.234
M-A-C, Bridge,

23:24.259 --> 23:27.159
get the live ballast against
the starboard bulkhead!

23:27.806 --> 23:30.373
M-A-C, Bridge! Shit!

23:30.671 --> 23:32.371
Internal Comms are down!

23:33.040 --> 23:34.227
I'll go!

23:34.686 --> 23:36.866
Hatches are holding, sir!

24:19.339 --> 24:21.239
All right, let's get ready to move!

24:21.339 --> 24:22.799
We're gonna go one by one!

24:22.899 --> 24:25.381
_

24:26.140 --> 24:27.600
All right, together now!

24:27.700 --> 24:29.640
We need everyone to stay together

24:29.740 --> 24:32.033
so we can balance the weight!

24:32.034 --> 24:34.962
_

24:36.981 --> 24:38.549
- Ready?
- Yeah! Good!

24:43.994 --> 24:47.094
Okay. She's got a child.

24:48.676 --> 24:49.896
Got to go.

24:49.921 --> 24:50.901
- Ready, Miller?
- Yeah!

24:51.001 --> 24:52.501
You hold on to that baby, okay?

24:52.601 --> 24:53.661
Hold on to that baby.

24:53.761 --> 24:55.181
I got her! I got her! I got her!

24:55.281 --> 24:57.421
_

24:57.521 --> 25:00.361
_

25:00.385 --> 25:01.883
_

25:01.907 --> 25:03.374
_

25:06.238 --> 25:07.906
We're going to be stuck...

25:08.509 --> 25:09.733
Hey, hey.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.656
_

25:11.680 --> 25:13.031
_

25:14.321 --> 25:16.321
_

25:21.278 --> 25:22.344
Corpsman!

25:22.678 --> 25:23.898
Hey! Hey! Corpsman, up!

25:23.998 --> 25:26.288
Get a team around. Just stay calm!

25:26.638 --> 25:28.872
It's okay. Take it easy, sir.

25:33.078 --> 25:35.966
Let's move him to medical.

25:39.079 --> 25:40.939
It's all right. I got him!

25:41.039 --> 25:43.659
Make way, Commander! Coming through.

25:43.759 --> 25:45.219
- Can I help?
- No.

25:45.740 --> 25:48.000
- We just gotta get him to medical.
- Okay.

26:02.340 --> 26:03.800
Bring him on in.

26:08.337 --> 26:09.779
Okay, just set him down.

26:09.804 --> 26:11.788
We have to transfer from the floor.

26:12.804 --> 26:14.384
Easy, easy.

26:20.364 --> 26:22.764
- All right.
- I got it from here.

26:29.412 --> 26:31.014
Sir, can you hear me?

26:31.015 --> 26:33.115
- Do you speak English?
- A little.

26:33.215 --> 26:34.362
Good.

26:34.695 --> 26:36.935
We're just gonna take your vitals.

26:51.943 --> 26:54.321
We got a big one coming portside.

26:54.588 --> 26:56.004
OOD, I have the conn.

26:56.004 --> 26:58.384
- Aye, Captain has the conn.
- Uhh!

26:58.484 --> 27:00.384
Helm, hard left rudder!

27:00.484 --> 27:02.252
Hard left rudder, aye!

27:05.423 --> 27:08.767
CIC, Bridge. I'm showing
a single contact on radar.

27:10.907 --> 27:12.407
Aah!

27:14.667 --> 27:16.107
Copy and confirmed, Captain Chandler.

27:16.187 --> 27:18.810
- We lost Alpha in the storm.
- We got one more.

27:19.881 --> 27:21.007
Captain Meylan!

27:21.737 --> 27:23.967
Green! Get Doc Rios up here now!

27:24.067 --> 27:25.167
Aye, Sir!

27:26.667 --> 27:27.872
CIC.

27:31.056 --> 27:34.376
Captain, the storm is pushing
us back toward Asteris island!

27:34.401 --> 27:37.141
- How far?
- 8 nautical miles!

27:37.456 --> 27:39.996
If they've set an ambush,
we're heading right for it.

27:40.096 --> 27:42.316
Good luck to 'em. Storm's
coming for all of us now.

27:42.416 --> 27:44.202
And the Hydra class is top heavy.

27:44.914 --> 27:46.916
I have a visual on the island.

27:48.467 --> 27:50.727
We gotta ride the troughs,
get between the waves.

27:51.103 --> 27:52.843
Hard right rudder, all ahead two thirds!

27:52.943 --> 27:55.409
Hard right rudder, aye!
All ahead two thirds!

27:55.589 --> 27:57.183
We're gonna put our beam to the seas

27:57.263 --> 27:59.121
until we lose that last contact.

28:04.109 --> 28:07.030
Bridge, Comms, I'm no longer
hearing the second ship.

28:07.077 --> 28:09.099
<i>Comms, Bridge, keep
looking. It's out there.</i>

28:09.404 --> 28:11.417
Damn it. Maybe I'm on the wrong channel.

28:21.228 --> 28:23.555
Careful now. Try to stay down.

28:24.002 --> 28:26.062
How's your head?

28:26.776 --> 28:29.370
It's not my head. It's just my shoulder.

28:30.171 --> 28:31.342
It's dislocated.

28:31.966 --> 28:34.349
I'm not gonna lie, it's gonna hurt.

28:34.592 --> 28:35.954
On three, okay?

28:37.713 --> 28:39.970
One, two...

28:40.994 --> 28:42.206
three!

28:47.262 --> 28:48.677
We lost 'em!

28:48.942 --> 28:50.482
- OOD, you have the conn.
- Aye, sir.

28:50.582 --> 28:52.602
Come to course 2-1-5.
Keep us zigzagging

28:52.702 --> 28:54.602
until we hit the navigable
side of the storm.

28:54.702 --> 28:57.562
Helm, right standard rudder,
steady course 2-1-5.

28:57.662 --> 29:00.402
My rudder's right 15 degrees
coming to course 2-1-5.

29:14.552 --> 29:15.852
Your heart's just fine, sir.

29:15.952 --> 29:18.572
It's humming away at a
cool 72 beats per minute.

29:18.672 --> 29:20.732
And your vitals are holding steady.

29:20.832 --> 29:23.212
As far as I can tell, this
wasn't a cardiac episode at all.

29:23.312 --> 29:26.212
Uhh!

29:26.980 --> 29:29.652
What you experienced was most likely

29:29.727 --> 29:31.216
a mild panic attack,

29:31.303 --> 29:33.203
which is understandable,

29:33.303 --> 29:35.180
given the condition you were found in.

29:36.040 --> 29:39.923
And, well, not to mention how
unnerving a storm at sea can be.

29:40.379 --> 29:42.179
I'm going to recommend
that you stay off your feet

29:42.259 --> 29:43.879
as much as possible for the next...

29:43.979 --> 29:45.319
Uhh!

29:46.819 --> 29:50.290
Shh. It's over. It's over.

30:05.738 --> 30:06.838
What you got, Chief?

30:06.938 --> 30:08.578
I was monitoring signals
from the Greek ships.

30:08.658 --> 30:10.478
I ran an ID check against all prior calls

30:10.578 --> 30:12.918
- routed through our satellite.
- And?

30:13.395 --> 30:15.495
- It's Commander Fletcher.
- What about him?

30:15.595 --> 30:18.455
He did not place a call to the
London Home Office this afternoon.

30:18.895 --> 30:20.549
He contacted another ship.

30:22.005 --> 30:23.255
Who'd he call, Chief?

30:23.841 --> 30:25.735
The channel he used matches
that of the Bravo contact

30:25.835 --> 30:28.021
we identified as the Greek Navy's flag.

30:30.968 --> 30:32.628
He gave the Greeks our position.

30:32.728 --> 30:34.248
That's how they found
us in the first place.

30:34.328 --> 30:36.748
- They knew where we were going.
- I have to find him.

30:36.848 --> 30:39.228
Alert the Master-at-arms
and duty gunner's mate.

30:39.328 --> 30:40.468
Yes, Sir.

30:40.890 --> 30:42.127
The seeds.

31:01.526 --> 31:02.706
Mr. Fletcher!

31:03.185 --> 31:05.225
I'm gonna have to ask
you to stop right there.

31:07.799 --> 31:09.239
I don't suppose I could convince you

31:09.319 --> 31:10.579
to put down the gun, could I?

31:10.679 --> 31:11.959
Drop the bag and put your hands

31:12.039 --> 31:13.279
on the ladder where I can see them.

31:13.694 --> 31:15.620
Don't make me ask you again, sir.

31:15.959 --> 31:17.470
I didn't wanna do this.

31:47.338 --> 31:49.318
Blow-in doors are
open for 1-Alpha GTM.

31:49.387 --> 31:50.957
We're taking in too much water.

31:50.988 --> 31:52.128
Reset the doors.

31:52.228 --> 31:54.324
_

31:54.349 --> 31:56.662
It's not working. The filters are clogged.

31:57.730 --> 31:59.295
We can't lose that engine.

31:59.530 --> 32:01.752
- I'm going up to reset manually.
- Copy.

32:10.050 --> 32:11.594
Cooper! Here!

32:13.810 --> 32:15.166
Oh, Johnny.

32:19.491 --> 32:20.823
He's gone.

32:24.039 --> 32:26.505
Oh, God, Fletcher. What have you done?

32:43.278 --> 32:44.533
Trawler captain.

32:45.684 --> 32:47.139
Son of a bitch.

32:47.993 --> 32:50.133
Security alert! Security alert!

32:50.158 --> 32:53.178
Seal all exits to the
ship! Man reaction forces!

33:56.992 --> 33:59.848
Look! There he is! Stop right there!

33:59.848 --> 34:02.748
Give it up, man! There's nowhere to hide!

34:05.067 --> 34:06.135
Make way!

34:26.109 --> 34:27.215
Shit!

34:47.058 --> 34:49.558
Hey, sir, you shouldn't be
out here! It's too dangerous!

34:49.658 --> 34:51.054
Aah!

35:03.698 --> 35:05.718
Aah!

35:21.565 --> 35:22.838
O'Connor!

35:24.239 --> 35:25.278
Captain...

35:26.729 --> 35:28.900
Damn it! O'Connor!

35:31.385 --> 35:32.739
Stay with me, son!

35:33.069 --> 35:34.405
Stay with me!

35:49.637 --> 35:50.897
Aah!

35:59.052 --> 36:00.202
Harry!

36:01.835 --> 36:04.175
Right on time, as always.

36:04.275 --> 36:06.316
Uhh!

36:07.329 --> 36:09.819
Here it is, the future of the world.

36:10.803 --> 36:13.575
I'm afraid it's all up to you now, Fletch.

36:26.804 --> 36:28.133
Fletcher!

36:30.931 --> 36:32.983
Don't!

37:01.359 --> 37:02.928
Mother, this is Sunshine.

37:02.928 --> 37:04.988
Continuing creeping line search pattern.

37:05.089 --> 37:07.829
Updated red light 0-niner-0-0.

37:07.929 --> 37:10.749
<i>Control, copy. 0-niner-0-0 red light.</i>

37:11.372 --> 37:13.682
- Anything?
- No, nothing.

37:15.043 --> 37:17.063
Mother's search area's empty. No joy.

37:17.162 --> 37:20.222
<i>10 mikes out, inbound for
hot pump. Request green deck.</i>

37:20.322 --> 37:21.582
Copy all, Sunshine.

37:21.682 --> 37:23.622
<i>Expect to shut down after landing.</i>

37:24.701 --> 37:26.301
Roger that, Mother.

37:58.572 --> 37:59.779
Anything?

37:59.833 --> 38:00.753
Helo's still in the air,

38:00.778 --> 38:02.018
scanning the water with infrareds,

38:02.098 --> 38:04.138
but so far, nothing, sir.

38:19.257 --> 38:22.579
There is absolutely
nothing in these belongings

38:22.610 --> 38:24.869
to suggest that refugee was
an actual trawler captain.

38:25.290 --> 38:27.088
Or even Middle Eastern, for that matter.

38:27.530 --> 38:29.250
No question he and Fletcher
were working together

38:29.330 --> 38:30.713
from the beginning.

38:31.210 --> 38:32.510
Much as I hate him right now,

38:32.610 --> 38:36.167
I hope to God he survived
the swim, for the seeds' sake.

38:36.970 --> 38:38.236
He survived.

38:40.583 --> 38:43.212
Greeks must have had a
ship waiting behind Asteris.

38:44.104 --> 38:46.344
That's why they were pushing
us towards the island.

38:48.935 --> 38:51.215
England's Prime Minister
claims Fletcher went rogue.

38:51.607 --> 38:54.235
That he was acting alone.
POTUS isn't buying it.

38:54.834 --> 38:56.146
Neither should we.

38:57.263 --> 38:59.669
But why throw away an
alliance with the U.S.?

39:01.314 --> 39:02.474
It's not like they're any closer

39:02.554 --> 39:04.328
to finding a cure for
the Red Rust than we are.

39:05.940 --> 39:07.560
They cut a side deal with Vellek.

39:08.139 --> 39:10.512
Planted the trawler
captain on the refugee boat,

39:10.612 --> 39:12.512
knowing we'd be compelled to pick 'em up.

39:12.612 --> 39:13.812
He got the word to Fletcher, then...

39:13.892 --> 39:15.481
they killed five of our men.

39:17.212 --> 39:20.236
O'Connor saved our asses
more than once. Heggen, too.

39:22.864 --> 39:24.192
Now they're dead.

39:32.985 --> 39:35.614
If Fletcher's still out
there, then so are the seeds.

39:36.985 --> 39:38.605
So we all know what our mission is.

39:38.971 --> 39:41.701
I want damage and readiness
reports in one hour.

39:42.064 --> 39:43.164
That is all.

39:50.181 --> 39:51.951
There's no way.

39:52.810 --> 39:55.911
There's no way he could
have played me this long.

39:56.609 --> 39:57.871
- Sasha...
- Tom...

39:59.469 --> 40:01.049
He was on our side

40:02.027 --> 40:03.891
until we went to rescue that boat.

40:08.502 --> 40:09.662
I know it.

40:24.281 --> 40:26.421
Giorgio, tell me you have good news.

40:26.521 --> 40:28.541
<i>No, sis, I have great news.</i>

40:29.161 --> 40:30.724
The package is secure.

40:31.081 --> 40:32.333
<i>Tell Dad.</i>

40:55.987 --> 40:58.847
There's no way in hell any man
should've survived that swim.

40:58.947 --> 41:01.263
That MI-6 shit is no joke, huh?

41:02.139 --> 41:03.831
Tough as nails, man.

41:04.499 --> 41:05.835
Respect.

41:08.334 --> 41:10.274
Well, welcome aboard, friend.

41:12.935 --> 41:14.440
I don't know about you,

41:14.855 --> 41:16.601
but I could use a drink.

41:18.857 --> 41:20.995
God knows I've earned it.
