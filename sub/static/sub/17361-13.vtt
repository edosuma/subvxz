(lock clicks)

00:06.089 --> 00:08.421
(hinges creak)

00:38.997 --> 00:40.407
(lock clicks)

00:40.582 --> 00:43.494
(music playing)

01:21.414 --> 01:26.579
(heavy breathing, whimpering)

01:26.753 --> 01:28.584
(Carol shouts)

01:44.521 --> 01:46.352
(sighs)

01:48.566 --> 01:50.397
(sighs)

02:02.497 --> 02:04.328
(sighs)

02:06.042 --> 02:07.873
(sighs)

02:09.879 --> 02:11.710
(match scrapes)

02:23.768 --> 02:26.350
(sighs)
God damn it.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.195
Wake it up, kid.

02:38.366 --> 02:40.448
(sighs)
Why does it have to be so early?

02:40.618 --> 02:42.825
Got a lotto do today.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.998
You want to go
back to sleep?

02:49.169 --> 02:50.705
No way.

02:50.879 --> 02:53.416
You said you wanted to be able
to knock your brother

02:53.590 --> 02:56.377
on his butt
when you first came to me.

02:56.551 --> 02:59.133
That really
what you want?

03:01.639 --> 03:03.254
Henry: Yeah.

03:03.433 --> 03:06.140
No.

03:06.311 --> 03:08.723
You want to be
like your brother.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.808
Yeah?

03:10.982 --> 03:13.564
Yeah.
(chuckles)

03:14.903 --> 03:17.110
All right.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.895
Check your feet,

03:19.073 --> 03:22.531
- 'cause if your feet ain't right--
- Nothing's right.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.283
Huh.

03:35.340 --> 03:40.960
(latch clicks, hinges squeak)

03:41.137 --> 03:45.050
(walkers growling in distance)

03:52.523 --> 03:56.232
(walker growling)

04:00.573 --> 04:04.236
(growling continues)

04:07.330 --> 04:11.039
(walkers growling)

04:18.299 --> 04:23.384
(metal clanking)

04:47.370 --> 04:48.780
Hey!

04:48.955 --> 04:50.195
We were just about
to come out to clear the--

04:50.373 --> 04:51.988
Where's Morgan?

04:52.166 --> 04:53.201
You okay?

04:53.376 --> 04:56.118
Where is Morgan?

05:05.555 --> 05:06.920
Why did Jesus bring Daryl

05:07.098 --> 05:09.009
and everyone else
to the Kingdom?

05:11.185 --> 05:15.394
They, um--

05:15.565 --> 05:17.055
they wanted to see
if we could all start

05:17.233 --> 05:19.349
working together
on things.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.361
The Saviors are still here.

05:24.532 --> 05:28.992
They're not fighting
with the Kingdom, but...

05:29.162 --> 05:31.699
Daryl said they beat them
back in Alexandria.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.283
Is that true?

05:33.458 --> 05:36.040
That they made a deal
with them?

05:36.210 --> 05:40.203
ls everyone okay?

05:40.381 --> 05:41.962
Just tell me
if it's true.

05:42.133 --> 05:44.749
You need to talk
to Daryl about that.

05:49.640 --> 05:52.177
You wanted me to keep
the whole story about you

05:52.352 --> 05:54.764
from everybody.

05:54.937 --> 05:56.848
Told me not
to say where you were,

05:57.023 --> 06:00.390
and I did what you asked.

06:00.568 --> 06:04.186
Daryl didn't find you
because of me.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.195
And what was said
between you and him

06:06.366 --> 06:09.529
was said
between you and him.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.370
I will go with you
to Alexandria,

06:14.540 --> 06:17.782
if you want
to make the trip...

06:17.960 --> 06:19.996
if you want
to talk to him.

06:25.927 --> 06:28.919
You shouldn't go alone.

06:39.107 --> 06:42.065
You found
what you wanted, right?

06:42.235 --> 06:44.601
You got away from everyone.

06:47.031 --> 06:49.113
Is it what you wanted?

06:51.411 --> 06:54.574
Was it just too late
to get away?

07:02.380 --> 07:05.463
Hey, we can leave
for Alexandria right now.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.591
Right now,
if you want to.

07:08.761 --> 07:12.470
(sighs)

07:16.018 --> 07:17.349
Is there anything
I can help you with?

07:17.520 --> 07:20.057
- No.
- Well, can ljust--?

07:20.231 --> 07:22.096
If you don't mind, could I walk
back to the cottage with you?

07:22.275 --> 07:24.561
No!

07:24.735 --> 07:27.226
We have a drop today,
but I can miss it.

07:28.239 --> 07:31.151
(sighs)
ljust...

07:31.325 --> 07:32.451
I'm trying to learn,

07:32.618 --> 07:35.485
and seeing
what you did here, I...

07:35.663 --> 07:39.076
There were five of them.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.786
I would
just really appreciate it

07:40.960 --> 07:46.296
if you would just let me see
how you do what you do.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.128
No.
Go do your drop.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.884
(insects buzz in distance)

07:53.639 --> 07:55.300
Okay.

07:55.475 --> 07:59.184
(birds chirp in distance)

08:41.270 --> 08:43.682
(sighs)

08:53.491 --> 08:56.073
(indistinct conversations)

08:56.244 --> 08:58.235
- I know! Me!
-Jenny.

08:58.412 --> 09:01.950
Here I come. Here I come!
(laughs)

09:10.591 --> 09:13.333
(door opens)

09:16.806 --> 09:18.797
Ezekiel:
You may approach, Nabila.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.556
I'm fine where lam.

09:22.144 --> 09:25.386
- Shiva likes you.
- (Shiva growls)

09:25.565 --> 09:27.851
That's what I'm afraid of.

09:30.903 --> 09:33.235
Tell me what you found.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.691
You're not gonna like it.

09:34.865 --> 09:38.449
I like waiting
to hear bad news less.

09:38.619 --> 09:39.950
We got a little problem
that could turn

09:40.121 --> 09:42.487
into a big problem
inside of a week.

09:42.665 --> 09:46.874
Most of the plants down there,
they got weevils.

09:47.044 --> 09:48.659
We have to cut
and burn everything

09:48.838 --> 09:52.547
before the weevils get to
the main crops in the courtyard.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.299
I know the royal garden is
important to you.

09:55.469 --> 09:57.084
I'm sorry.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.969
(sighs)

09:59.140 --> 10:01.096
Thank you, Nabila.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.303
Do what must be done.

10:03.477 --> 10:06.389
Here's the beautiful thing,
Your Majesty--

10:06.564 --> 10:09.772
You can tear it out
and cut it down.

10:09.942 --> 10:12.854
You can burn it
and throw it all away.

10:13.029 --> 10:15.520
But if you want,
it can all grow back.

10:15.698 --> 10:20.317
(Shiva growls)

10:20.494 --> 10:24.282
Okay.
I think ljust pissed myself.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.244
I'm-a gonna go.

10:29.629 --> 10:33.292
(door opens, closes)

10:46.646 --> 10:48.352
We're at
"five minutes go."

10:48.522 --> 10:49.898
Okay.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.352
Um...

10:52.526 --> 10:54.027
thank you for this.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.607
(sighs)
I'm still thinking about it.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.864
"To injure an opponent is
to injure oneself."

11:02.328 --> 11:04.284
Get injured
no matter what.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.741
(sighs)

11:06.916 --> 11:10.534
I got something for you,
for the new place.

11:10.711 --> 11:12.542
Thanks.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.296
(chuckles)

11:20.471 --> 11:21.711
Wow.

11:21.889 --> 11:24.551
I found it at a restaurant
I was scavenging.

11:24.725 --> 11:27.933
I know a girl,
and she, uh, fixed it up for me.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.556
There.

11:33.734 --> 11:35.816
l was getting tired
of looking at that nail.

11:35.986 --> 11:39.729
(chuckles)

11:39.907 --> 11:41.488
So, who's the girl?

11:41.659 --> 11:43.320
Uh...
(sighs)

11:43.494 --> 11:45.780
We're at, like,
"three minutes go" right now,

11:45.955 --> 11:47.616
SO...

12:04.181 --> 12:06.388
Kid's too young
to be a father.

12:08.310 --> 12:09.891
Were you one?

12:11.188 --> 12:13.600
l was, thank God.

12:13.774 --> 12:15.059
But I wasn't too young--

12:15.234 --> 12:18.818
perfect age, perfect time.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.442
I had myself the perfect family
and the perfect life.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.944
I didn't ask for much,
and I got more than I deserved.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.621
And you?

12:38.966 --> 12:44.177
I'm sorry for how things have
been between you and me.

12:44.346 --> 12:46.758
I think you're wrong
about killing...

12:46.932 --> 12:49.139
about how you think things can
last like this with the Saviors.

12:49.310 --> 12:50.971
(pistol cocks)

12:51.145 --> 12:54.308
But I'm sorry.

12:54.482 --> 12:57.064
I know you're a good man.

13:02.406 --> 13:06.399
The day's coming
where you can't be that good.

13:06.577 --> 13:08.568
When that happens,

13:08.746 --> 13:10.486
don't beat yourself up
about it.

13:16.545 --> 13:20.129
Ezekiel: Benjamin, it's time
for us to take our leave.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.499
See you, little man.

13:25.721 --> 13:26.710
Leave the cobbler.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.971
- (truck door closes)
- (muffled) Really?

13:29.141 --> 13:30.347
Jerry.

13:32.853 --> 13:34.013
Fine.

13:34.188 --> 13:36.019
(engine starts)

13:42.238 --> 13:43.853
Who's the girl?

13:44.031 --> 13:45.862
(chuckles)

13:57.127 --> 14:00.665
Richard: Everyone stay down.
Get your guns up.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.085
Somebody blocked the road.

14:04.260 --> 14:07.127
Can't be
for anything good.

14:07.304 --> 14:11.047
Your Majesty,
stay inside.

14:11.225 --> 14:14.934
(engine idling)

14:26.407 --> 14:28.989
Take a look if you want,
but keep your guns up.

14:29.159 --> 14:30.990
(engine shuts off)

14:42.047 --> 14:44.038
Echelon right.

14:44.216 --> 14:47.208
Force towards
the building over there.

14:49.096 --> 14:50.927
Let's close around the king.

14:51.098 --> 14:52.884
I got cover.

15:05.696 --> 15:08.028
Richard: Let's move
towards the building.

15:14.163 --> 15:16.154
Benjamin,
get your gun up.

15:19.501 --> 15:21.583
Think that's high enough?

15:21.754 --> 15:23.585
You're fine, man.

15:52.076 --> 15:53.907
Dianne: Jesus...

15:59.625 --> 16:05.165
This world drives one mad.

16:05.339 --> 16:08.706
People have lived through
every kind of misery--

16:08.884 --> 16:12.092
tyrants, genocide,
systems of quiet hate--

16:12.262 --> 16:15.004
while others enjoy freedom
on the same piece of land.

16:15.182 --> 16:18.720
Yet this,
how we must exist now--

16:18.894 --> 16:21.681
It is mere luck
we are not all insane.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.806
It isn't luck,
Your Majesty.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.474
How's that?

16:26.652 --> 16:30.395
The world does
drive people crazy now.

16:30.572 --> 16:33.530
But...

16:33.701 --> 16:35.737
you made us
another world.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.502
(grunting)

17:00.477 --> 17:02.217
(engine shuts off)

17:02.396 --> 17:04.853
(truck doors open, close)

17:10.696 --> 17:12.027
You're late.

17:12.197 --> 17:14.313
If you could indulge us
your pardon, our path--

17:14.491 --> 17:16.356
I don't want
to hear about it.

17:16.535 --> 17:17.866
Don't interrupt the king.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.361
Unh!

17:23.292 --> 17:26.125
You rat-faced prick.

17:26.295 --> 17:29.332
Gavin: Ezekiel,
there aren't any kings,

17:29.506 --> 17:32.589
presidents,
or prime ministers.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.877
And all that is
a fairy tale, too.

17:36.055 --> 17:39.764
Don't bring that
"Your Highness" shit our way.

17:39.933 --> 17:44.393
Now, I appreciate that
you've been delivering, but...

17:45.647 --> 17:47.308
things have been
unnecessarily tense,

17:47.483 --> 17:49.690
and that makes me
unnecessarily tense.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.067
I didn't go this route
for stress.

17:52.237 --> 17:55.445
No.
Just the opposite.

17:55.616 --> 17:58.779
So let's get to it.
Do you have today's offering?

18:03.665 --> 18:05.621
(sighs)

18:10.839 --> 18:12.249
I want your guns, too.

18:12.424 --> 18:15.837
(guns cock)

18:16.011 --> 18:17.876
We did not agree
to that.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.137
Well, you got a choice--

18:20.307 --> 18:22.389
same one that's been there
since the beginning, I guess.

18:22.559 --> 18:26.268
You can give up your guns,
or you can try to use them.

18:27.689 --> 18:29.600
What's it gonna be?

18:38.158 --> 18:40.365
We should give them over,
Your Majesty.

18:40.536 --> 18:43.573
(mockingly) "Ehh, we should
give 'em over, Your Majesty."

18:45.624 --> 18:48.206
Or maybe I'll just shove
this down your throat.

18:50.212 --> 18:52.043
Give Morgan
his stick back.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.704
(chuckles)

18:53.882 --> 18:55.463
Then you can have
the guns.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.966
And all of us can go on
with our day's journeys.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.753
Ezekiel...

19:00.931 --> 19:04.219
I need you
to understand the gravity

19:04.393 --> 19:06.759
of what's happening here.

19:06.937 --> 19:08.598
I gave you a choice.

19:08.772 --> 19:12.606
What is it going to be?

19:12.776 --> 19:14.812
Come on.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.568
You know the answer.

19:16.738 --> 19:18.990
Morgan: It's fine.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.291
Give them your guns.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.219
We took your guns just now

19:43.390 --> 19:45.221
because things are
about to get emotional.

19:45.392 --> 19:46.598
You guys have proven

19:46.768 --> 19:49.430
that you don't do so good
with emotional.

19:49.605 --> 19:52.187
You're short.

19:52.357 --> 19:53.813
We said 12.
lcount11.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.099
There are 12 there.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.063
- There aren't.
- Count again.

19:57.237 --> 19:58.647
You count them!

20:10.876 --> 20:13.583
I counted them.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.665
I did.
T-this is impossible.

20:15.839 --> 20:18.216
It's possible.

20:18.383 --> 20:20.419
It's real.

20:20.594 --> 20:23.301
It's happening now.

20:23.472 --> 20:27.966
And the problems have
to end now.

20:28.143 --> 20:30.475
You have to learn
the stakes here,

20:30.646 --> 20:34.184
- so we're gonna teach you.
- You don't have to do anything.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.474
We'll get you twice the tribute
in an hour.

20:36.652 --> 20:41.988
Right now
is the only time that matters.

20:42.157 --> 20:45.649
And right now...

20:45.827 --> 20:48.489
you haven't held up
your side of the bargain.

20:49.831 --> 20:52.573
Gavin: After we have talked
about things,

20:52.751 --> 20:54.958
over and over

20:55.128 --> 20:57.039
again and again.

20:59.633 --> 21:02.249
So we're gonna deal
with all of this...

21:04.721 --> 21:06.803
right now.

21:06.974 --> 21:10.057
Right now
as in "right now"?

21:10.227 --> 21:11.433
Yeah.

21:11.603 --> 21:14.185
Right now.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.062
(sighs)

21:16.233 --> 21:18.064
(pistol cocks)

21:40.340 --> 21:41.955
Just do it.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.249
(sighs)

21:43.427 --> 21:44.542
Okay.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.381
- (gunshot, body thumps)
- Morgan: No!

21:48.056 --> 21:50.342
- (gunshot, body thumps)
- Morgan: No!

21:50.517 --> 21:53.224
- (screaming)
- Gavin: Everybody settle down!

21:53.395 --> 21:56.853
We need to get Benjamin
back to the Kingdom.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.066
Give the man his damn stick!

22:01.236 --> 22:04.524
Get in the truck!
Don't say a goddamn word!

22:06.241 --> 22:07.230
(staff clatters)

22:07.409 --> 22:09.491
- We need to get back.
- No.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.242
Right now,
you have to listen.

22:11.413 --> 22:14.701
Foronce,
be present and listen.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.661
You will make
your deliveries on time,

22:16.835 --> 22:19.076
every time,
and they will be complete.

22:19.254 --> 22:21.745
It's As or Fs,
no ls.

22:21.923 --> 22:23.208
(snaps fingers)

22:23.383 --> 22:25.044
You are gonna show me
that you understand

22:25.218 --> 22:27.425
by bringing the balance
of what you owe tomorrow.

22:27.596 --> 22:29.257
We need to go!
He's bleeding out!

22:29.431 --> 22:31.763
One cantaloupe,
not more, not less!

22:31.933 --> 22:34.015
Do you understand?!

22:34.186 --> 22:36.268
Yes, I understand.

22:36.438 --> 22:37.598
Gavin:
Go patch him up.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.013
- Okay.
- (grunts)

22:39.191 --> 22:41.056
Dianne, we need
to drive to Carol's!

22:41.234 --> 22:43.065
We loaded her up
with medical supplies!

22:43.236 --> 22:44.442
We need to stop the bleeding.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.023
He's not gonna make it
to the Kingdom.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.735
- Benjamin: Aah!
- Let's go!

22:48.909 --> 22:49.898
Up!

22:50.077 --> 22:51.908
- (Benjamin coughing)
- (engine starts)

22:52.079 --> 22:54.035
Hey!
Get in!

22:59.127 --> 23:01.118
(dirt scrapes)

23:12.265 --> 23:15.974
(engine revving in distance)

23:18.313 --> 23:21.931
(revving continues)

23:22.109 --> 23:24.191
(tires screech)

23:32.077 --> 23:33.157
(door closes)

23:33.328 --> 23:35.319
Ezekiel: Stay with me.
Stay with me.

23:35.497 --> 23:37.488
I'm right here.
Stay with me.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.827
(Benjamin breathing heavily)

23:40.001 --> 23:41.127
Ezekiel: All right.
Okay.

23:41.294 --> 23:43.831
It's okay.
(gasping)

23:44.005 --> 23:48.339
It's okay.

23:48.510 --> 23:53.129
"T-to injure an opponent...

23:53.306 --> 23:56.298
is to injure yourself."

23:56.476 --> 24:00.185
(somber tones play)

24:06.820 --> 24:10.529
(dripping echoes)

24:26.381 --> 24:28.542
I'm sorry
for coming to you.

24:28.717 --> 24:30.548
We had no choice.

24:40.854 --> 24:42.685
Carol:
Morgan, wait.

24:52.908 --> 24:54.990
(breathes shakily)
Okay.

24:56.244 --> 24:58.155
(gasps)
Oh, God.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.412
(sighing)
Mm.

25:03.919 --> 25:05.625
Stay away from me.

25:05.795 --> 25:08.787
(whispering indistinctly)

25:08.965 --> 25:10.171
Just listen.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.878
(grunts)

25:14.721 --> 25:17.713
(growls)
No! No! Aah!

25:19.601 --> 25:21.057
I know!

25:23.271 --> 25:25.307
No!No!No!

25:26.441 --> 25:27.772
I know!

25:30.612 --> 25:32.352
Enougtho!

25:35.075 --> 25:36.906
(crate clatters)

25:44.417 --> 25:46.248
(sniffles)

25:49.256 --> 25:51.338
Benjamin,
get your gun up.

25:53.426 --> 25:55.678
(birds chirp in distance)

26:03.436 --> 26:05.688
(door slams)

26:16.825 --> 26:18.781
It was supposed
to be me.

26:21.454 --> 26:25.493
That's what Gavin said--

26:25.667 --> 26:26.907
that I'd be first.

26:27.085 --> 26:29.167
l was trying to stop it.

26:29.337 --> 26:33.080
l was gonna give
my life to show you!

26:33.258 --> 26:35.965
That's what should've
happened today.

26:36.136 --> 26:38.752
That's what I tried.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.670
And something else happened

26:40.849 --> 26:44.683
because we have done nothing
to stop them.

26:44.853 --> 26:46.684
We've done nothing!

26:58.033 --> 26:59.864
Nothing.

27:04.998 --> 27:06.829
(breathes shakily)

27:09.961 --> 27:12.373
l was in a camp
when it started.

27:15.216 --> 27:18.879
It was huge, endless--

27:21.139 --> 27:24.131
a city of-- of tarps
and latrines

27:24.309 --> 27:27.551
and wood smoke
and babies crying.

27:31.358 --> 27:33.895
There were
always babies crying.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.069
I knew they had problems,

27:41.242 --> 27:44.234
but I didn't think
they were mine to solve.

27:44.412 --> 27:48.405
I thought there were stronger
or smarter people there than me.

27:51.503 --> 27:54.210
(voice breaking)
W-who the hell am I, right?

27:58.593 --> 28:00.629
So I did nothing.

28:04.724 --> 28:07.261
A-and there was a fight...

28:07.435 --> 28:10.893
(93595)
...and a fire.

28:11.064 --> 28:13.305
And I lost my wife.

28:15.944 --> 28:21.359
And after three days of running,
no food, and no sleep...

28:22.617 --> 28:25.984
of horror and terror...

28:27.872 --> 28:30.864
(93595)
...I lost my little girl.

28:34.963 --> 28:36.874
Right in front of me...

28:45.932 --> 28:49.641
because I didn't do
something.

28:51.980 --> 28:54.596
Because I waited.

28:54.774 --> 28:57.516
(breathes deeply)

29:09.497 --> 29:11.328
Listen to me.

29:11.499 --> 29:14.616
Please.

29:14.794 --> 29:19.003
Just listen.

29:19.174 --> 29:22.507
We can use
what's happened.

29:22.677 --> 29:25.635
We can show the Saviors
that we get it.

29:27.015 --> 29:30.348
We understand
what we need to do.

29:30.518 --> 29:35.603
We know how to go on.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.607
And they need
to believe us.

29:38.777 --> 29:42.395
We have to do something
to make them believe us.

29:45.158 --> 29:48.992
And then, when we gain
their trust back...

29:50.246 --> 29:52.453
we kill them...

29:52.624 --> 29:54.785
end them.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.995
We join with Alexandria
and the Hilltop,

29:57.170 --> 30:00.082
and we crush them
in one fell swoop.

30:05.804 --> 30:10.844
But this is it, Morgan.

30:11.017 --> 30:15.727
You have... to... kill.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.984
Or else you might as well
just kill yourself.

30:29.744 --> 30:31.735
Someone had to die.

30:31.913 --> 30:35.326
I tried to be the one.
That didn't happen.

30:42.173 --> 30:44.004
So I'll be the one
to lead our army

30:44.175 --> 30:47.463
to crush the Saviors--
destroy them.

30:49.055 --> 30:51.341
Me.

30:53.935 --> 30:57.268
I'll talk to Ezekiel.

30:57.438 --> 30:59.429
I'll tell everyone
what I did.

31:02.026 --> 31:05.268
And I'll live the rest
of my life making up for it.

32:06.549 --> 32:10.258
(hinges creak)

32:18.728 --> 32:22.437
(engines shut off)

32:28.154 --> 32:31.897
(truck doors open, close)

32:35.536 --> 32:37.572
Did you tell him?

32:40.667 --> 32:42.658
Did you?

32:42.835 --> 32:45.497
Not now.

32:45.672 --> 32:47.208
We'll talk about it
when we get back.

32:47.382 --> 32:49.122
What is it?

32:49.300 --> 32:51.256
It's better to talk about it
when we get back, Your Majesty.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.680
We'll talk about it now.

32:57.850 --> 33:01.593
(engine rumbling in distance)

33:22.208 --> 33:24.540
(brakes squeak)

33:24.711 --> 33:26.702
(engine idling)

33:29.757 --> 33:31.964
(brakes squeak)

33:32.135 --> 33:33.375
(engine shuts off)

33:33.553 --> 33:36.010
(truck doors open, close)

33:45.606 --> 33:48.018
Gavin:
How's the kid?

34:04.042 --> 34:06.499
He's dead.

34:12.467 --> 34:15.880
Start walking back now
before I kill you.

34:16.929 --> 34:18.635
You say one word
or throw one look,

34:18.806 --> 34:22.515
I'll kill you
right here and now.

34:22.685 --> 34:24.516
Go!

34:43.998 --> 34:45.829
Do you have it?

35:01.182 --> 35:04.766
| just want to say we get it.

35:04.936 --> 35:06.301
- We understand.
- (staff clatters)

35:10.066 --> 35:12.523
- Ezekiel: Cease this!
- Gavin: Leave 'em be!

35:12.693 --> 35:13.773
(gun cocks)

35:13.945 --> 35:15.651
Morgan! Stop!

35:15.822 --> 35:17.528
Morgan!

35:17.698 --> 35:20.861
- (Morgan grunting)
' (gagging)

35:29.210 --> 35:31.041
(grunts)

35:32.421 --> 35:35.208
(head thudding)

35:35.383 --> 35:39.092
- (grunting)
- (choking)

35:41.722 --> 35:45.306
(gurgling)

35:49.647 --> 35:52.309
(gurgling stops)

36:08.124 --> 36:10.615
He set it all up.

36:14.630 --> 36:16.882
He blocked the road yesterday,
made us late.

36:20.428 --> 36:22.510
It was all him.

36:25.224 --> 36:29.012
And we had your offering
when we left--

36:29.187 --> 36:30.267
had it all.

36:34.650 --> 36:38.893
He took one from the cargo,
and he hid it

36:39.071 --> 36:40.572
when we stopped.

36:40.740 --> 36:42.150
He wanted
to get something started

36:42.325 --> 36:45.408
between the Kingdom
and the Saviors.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.375
Hey.

36:54.545 --> 36:56.376
Hey!

37:01.052 --> 37:04.510
Wanted to show you...

37:04.680 --> 37:09.049
wanted to show you
that we get it,

37:09.227 --> 37:11.934
that we understand what it is
that we need to do...

37:12.104 --> 37:16.268
(voice breaking)
...that we know how to go on.

37:22.907 --> 37:24.738
Gavin: Good.

37:27.828 --> 37:31.662
Next week, same time.

37:35.378 --> 37:38.711
We-- we understand.

37:43.386 --> 37:47.425
(footsteps departing)

37:47.598 --> 37:48.929
(truck doors open, close)

37:49.100 --> 37:52.342
(engines start)

37:52.520 --> 37:54.056
(engines rumbling)

37:54.230 --> 37:57.939
(vehicles depart)

38:00.486 --> 38:03.068
He-- he did this?

38:03.239 --> 38:06.276
Morgan:
He wanted to die for us before.

38:06.450 --> 38:09.066
He wanted it to be him.

38:14.417 --> 38:18.160
Thought he could choose,
and that's why Duane had to die.

38:21.424 --> 38:22.504
"Duane"?

38:22.675 --> 38:26.964
(stammers)

38:38.107 --> 38:40.473
Benjamin-- Benjamin--
that's why Benjamin...

38:40.651 --> 38:42.482
(sighs)

38:46.198 --> 38:48.735
Morgan...

38:48.909 --> 38:50.445
let us take our leave.

38:50.619 --> 38:53.326
l was supposed to.

38:53.497 --> 38:55.203
Morgan, you should not
be alone here.

38:55.374 --> 38:57.410
Go.

38:57.585 --> 38:59.200
Not now.

38:59.378 --> 39:02.495
- Benjamin not-- would not--
- Man, I said not now!

39:05.384 --> 39:07.841
I said...

39:14.560 --> 39:17.017
y'all just go.

39:57.770 --> 39:59.886
(insects buzzing in distance)

40:48.571 --> 40:52.234
(walkers growling)

41:22.396 --> 41:25.308
Morgan: Do you really want to know
what happened in Alexandria?

41:28.068 --> 41:31.401
What happened to you?

41:31.572 --> 41:33.654
Killed Richard.

41:36.660 --> 41:39.117
l strangled him.

41:41.123 --> 41:43.910
He's the one
got Benjamin killed, so...

41:47.379 --> 41:51.122
Do you want to know
what happened in Alexandria?

41:56.805 --> 41:58.636
Yeah.

42:03.771 --> 42:06.478
Negan killed Glenn
and Abraham.

42:08.192 --> 42:10.604
What?

42:10.778 --> 42:14.316
Beat them to death
with a baseball bat.

42:14.490 --> 42:16.947
(gasps)

42:18.661 --> 42:22.074
Now the Saviors have Alexandria,
and Rick and everybody else...

42:24.124 --> 42:27.036
everything they do
is for the Saviors now.

42:38.472 --> 42:40.884
And they killed more.

42:44.061 --> 42:48.020
Killed Spencer,
Olivia...

42:51.443 --> 42:54.571
Jesus brought Rick
and the rest here because...

42:55.573 --> 42:57.689
Rick wants to fight them.

43:01.495 --> 43:03.781
(sighs)

43:03.956 --> 43:07.540
You wanted to know.

43:07.710 --> 43:11.373
Now you do.

43:11.547 --> 43:13.538
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna kill them--

43:13.716 --> 43:15.331
out there, one by one.

43:15.509 --> 43:17.090
But where?
Somewhere else.

43:17.261 --> 43:18.341
W-wait.

43:18.512 --> 43:20.594
Wait. Just wait.
Wait!

43:26.312 --> 43:30.351
You can go and not go.

43:36.238 --> 43:38.069
Please.

43:42.411 --> 43:44.242
