WEBVTT

00:06.382 --> 00:07.622
Well is it them or isn't it?

00:07.717 --> 00:10.208
Moya can't be certain until
she's closer.

00:10.303 --> 00:12.510
Which one? Green or black?
-This is not the time.

00:12.597 --> 00:14.303
D'Argo, green or black?

00:14.390 --> 00:16.597
Well, the black, of course.
I mean, far be it for me to say

00:16.684 --> 00:18.424
but I've always thought that
the cut of that green shirt

00:18.519 --> 00:20.305
doesn't suit the shape
of your body.

00:20.396 --> 00:23.012
You know, it's gotta be
them. We are near the
rendezvous point.

00:23.107 --> 00:26.019
If it is them, why are they
on a Transport Pod?

00:26.110 --> 00:27.316
And where's Talyn?

00:27.403 --> 00:29.189
Jool:
Oh hoo!

00:29.280 --> 00:32.443
Crichton is not going to like
having the other Crichton
around again.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.319
Yeah, he'll like having
Aeryn around, though.

00:39.624 --> 00:42.115
Yeah! You look blexkl

00:42.210 --> 00:43.620
In this?
-Yeah.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.121
ldon't think so.

00:45.213 --> 00:48.046
Pilot:
The Transport Pod has turned
and is heading our way.

00:48.132 --> 00:49.338
You made contact yet?

00:49.425 --> 00:51.211
Yes, but they're not responding.

00:51.302 --> 00:53.759
You know what, perhaps
they can't respond.

00:53.846 --> 00:57.509
In the last message we received,
all they said is that they'd
defeated a Retrieval Squad.

00:57.600 --> 01:00.216
We don't know at what cost.

01:00.311 --> 01:04.270
D'Argo, if Talyn is a
casualty, then...

01:04.357 --> 01:07.099
John, I'm sure everyone's
aHnght

01:07.193 --> 01:10.401
Pilot:
Rendezvous in 600 microts.

01:12.198 --> 01:13.938
Pilot, there could be
casualties.

01:14.033 --> 01:18.367
Have them land nearthe med
area, and get Jool and Chiana
down here fast!

01:34.470 --> 01:36.552
Chiana:
She's going to be walking off
that Pod, I know it.

01:36.639 --> 01:41.804
Chiana's right. Aeryn's fine.
I'm sure the other you has
taken extra good care of her.

01:41.894 --> 01:45.386
I mean, all I meant was that
I'm sure that he did everything
that you would have done

01:45.481 --> 01:48.223
if you had been with
Aeryn all this time.

01:51.070 --> 01:52.480
Don't movel

01:52.571 --> 01:55.062
Please. Don't move.

01:55.157 --> 01:56.943
I doubt that we could.

01:59.829 --> 02:01.365
Identify yourself.

02:01.455 --> 02:04.242
Our calling card.

02:04.333 --> 02:07.416
A Peacekeeper tralk.

02:07.503 --> 02:09.744
(electronic chirping)

02:11.507 --> 02:13.088
(weary groan )

02:13.175 --> 02:17.134
We have just escaped
from imprisonment.

02:17.221 --> 02:18.961
Can you help us?

02:26.647 --> 02:29.263
My name is John Crichton...
I'm lost...
an astronaut.

02:29.358 --> 02:33.021
I got shot through
a wormhole...
In some distant part of the universe...

02:33.112 --> 02:34.477
I'm trying to stay alive...

02:34.572 --> 02:36.483
Aboard this ship...
This living ship...

02:36.574 --> 02:39.281
Of escaped prisoners.
My friends.

02:39.368 --> 02:41.074
If you can hear me...
Beware.

02:41.162 --> 02:43.153
lfl make it back...
Will they follow?

02:43.247 --> 02:45.704
If I open the door...
Are you ready?

02:45.791 --> 02:50.251
Earth is unprepared...
Helpless,
for the nightmares I've seen.

02:50.338 --> 02:52.670
Or should I stay...
Protect my home...

02:52.757 --> 02:55.214
Not show them...
You exist...

02:55.301 --> 02:59.260
But then you will never know
the wonders I've seen.

03:37.802 --> 03:40.714
You were traveling through the
Uncharted Territories in a
Transport Pod?

03:40.805 --> 03:44.297
A Pod that was meant as a
target for the weapons testing

03:44.392 --> 03:48.806
of a new Peacekeeper
deep space device.

03:48.896 --> 03:52.104
Ah, you have more Janeray syrup?

03:52.191 --> 03:53.271
(sighs)

03:53.359 --> 03:55.270
She is like Rygel.

03:55.361 --> 03:57.773
What were you doing in a Pod
meant for weapons testing?

03:57.863 --> 04:01.321
We were part of the test.

04:01.409 --> 04:05.903
They wanted to see how
different species would react
to fire from their new weapon.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.952
How we would die.

04:08.040 --> 04:11.828
Orhnn:
The Peacekeeper Tech was doing
a last microt check of the Pod.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.205
We were able to overpower him.

04:14.296 --> 04:17.333
l was able over to
overpower him.

04:17.425 --> 04:20.167
And blast ourselves
out of there.

04:20.261 --> 04:22.343
D'Argo:
Ah-ah-ah-ah. Not too close.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.466
He's a Scarran.

04:24.557 --> 04:28.550
If you are concerned because
of my heat protection,

04:30.980 --> 04:34.893
first thing Peacekeepers do
with Scarran prisoners.

04:34.984 --> 04:39.353
By removing the gland,
it protects them

04:39.447 --> 04:42.860
and weakens me.

04:51.333 --> 04:55.167
Frell. This Pod is coming
apart at the seams.

04:55.254 --> 04:59.418
The weapon the Peacekeepers
were testing destroys the
bonding of metallic molecules.

04:59.508 --> 05:01.089
That's why this Pod
is so damaged.

05:01.177 --> 05:03.133
Crichton:
What exactly are we
looking for?

05:03.220 --> 05:04.471
A Boolite.

05:04.555 --> 05:06.295
And what does he look like?

05:06.390 --> 05:09.632
Big, small, hairy, blue, green?

05:09.727 --> 05:13.345
He doesn't... look like
he used to.

05:13.439 --> 05:18.058
You see, Boolites have a much,
much higher metal content
than other species,

05:18.152 --> 05:20.234
so when the weapon hit
our Pod, it...

05:20.321 --> 05:22.027
Excuse me.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.698
What the hell is this?

05:26.785 --> 05:29.276
That's the Boolite, or
at least part of him.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.578
Okay.

05:31.665 --> 05:37.285
Boolite body parts can survive
independent of the main body
for as much as half a cycle.

05:38.631 --> 05:40.121
Right.

05:40.216 --> 05:42.332
And he's still alive?

05:42.426 --> 05:44.291
You have to try to save him.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.297
Help put him back together.

05:46.388 --> 05:47.924
(wet squishing)

05:49.016 --> 05:50.426
Right.

05:54.271 --> 05:56.853
Rygel:
Why aren't they at the
rendezvous point?

05:56.941 --> 06:02.436
If I have to spend two more
microts on this midget ship,
I'm going to vomit!

06:02.530 --> 06:05.772
Talyn has found Moya at the
extreme range of his senses.

06:05.866 --> 06:10.109
Oh! Was it too much to ask
that they be where they
said they'd be?

06:10.204 --> 06:14.163
Talyn, set intercept course.

06:17.419 --> 06:19.330
He's coming! He's coming!

06:19.421 --> 06:23.209
It's Talyn. He's on an
intercept course.

06:29.932 --> 06:32.298
What?

06:32.393 --> 06:34.258
Why don't you go and
welcome them back.

06:34.353 --> 06:38.016
I'll make sure our guests don't
get into any trouble.

06:39.483 --> 06:41.314
Thanks, man.

07:09.388 --> 07:10.673
Sparky!

07:10.764 --> 07:13.176
How you doin', man?

07:13.267 --> 07:14.473
Long time, no see.

07:14.560 --> 07:18.348
Yes. Uh... good to
see you, too.

07:18.439 --> 07:22.682
But if anything is missing
from my quarters, blood is
going to spill.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.312
( chuckles )

07:25.195 --> 07:26.651
Whatever.

07:36.415 --> 07:37.780
Crais.

07:49.553 --> 07:52.169
Well, there's a familiar face.

08:05.194 --> 08:06.604
Hello, John.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.552
What's wrong?

08:36.266 --> 08:38.302
The, uh...

08:41.814 --> 08:43.020
other...

08:43.107 --> 08:44.688
Crichton,

08:44.775 --> 08:46.231
he's dead.

09:16.265 --> 09:17.721
( sniffing )

09:17.808 --> 09:18.923
Oh...

09:19.017 --> 09:23.226
You, uh, have visitors on Moya?

09:26.316 --> 09:28.147
Yeah, there's, um...

09:28.235 --> 09:30.851
( sniffing )

09:30.946 --> 09:34.530
Oh, a female!

09:34.616 --> 09:36.777
( expectant gasp )

09:43.709 --> 09:45.620
(whirring )

09:47.171 --> 09:49.287
Rygel:
Oh...

09:50.257 --> 09:53.715
It is. A female.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.508
( chuckles )

09:56.180 --> 09:58.421
Oh, please rise.

09:58.515 --> 10:01.222
You recognize me?

10:01.310 --> 10:03.767
Who could forget the
royal profile?

10:04.229 --> 10:05.685
You're alive.

10:05.773 --> 10:08.139
Indeed. And you are?

10:08.233 --> 10:11.350
Orhnn Pak. From the
Jensii province.

10:11.445 --> 10:12.355
Oh...

10:12.446 --> 10:14.687
At least, I was.

10:14.782 --> 10:17.694
And you have been a
Peacekeeper prisoner?

10:17.785 --> 10:22.575
Arrested because I refused
allegiance to Dominar Bishan.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.950
Oh, that's no crime.

10:25.042 --> 10:26.157
It's an act of courage.

10:26.251 --> 10:29.368
Oh, I shouldn't have been
speaking of myself,

10:29.463 --> 10:34.253
of my travails, when lam
in your presence.

10:34.343 --> 10:38.302
Forgive me, Your Highness.
Forgive me.

10:38.388 --> 10:45.226
Now, it is permissible for you
to be the focus of attention,
if! desire it.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.267
Oh?

10:46.355 --> 10:48.971
And I, uh...

10:50.818 --> 10:55.187
I do so desire it.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.733
It just needs to give us
some idea of what the
Boolite looks like.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.285
Stand there.

11:03.372 --> 11:04.703
As you instruct.

11:04.790 --> 11:06.951
And don't even think
about moving.

11:07.042 --> 11:08.077
Chiana.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.829
Have you seen Aeryn
and the others?

11:09.920 --> 11:11.376
Only for a moment.

11:11.463 --> 11:14.250
Not quite the reunion
we were expecting.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.959
The other Crichton dead and...
and Stark searching for
Zhaan's spirit.

11:18.053 --> 11:20.715
Well, with a single Crichton
and Stark missing,

11:20.806 --> 11:23.923
perhaps it will restore some
sanity to the ship.

11:26.311 --> 11:27.562
Stand back!

11:27.646 --> 11:28.886
What?

11:31.275 --> 11:33.561
A pulse blast.
Didn't you hear it?

11:34.236 --> 11:35.146
No.

11:35.237 --> 11:36.443
It was here!

11:45.539 --> 11:47.575
Okay. Okay.

11:47.666 --> 11:49.156
It's happening again.

11:49.251 --> 11:52.209
I'm frelling sensing stuff
before it happens.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.495
So much for sanity.

11:54.590 --> 11:55.579
Move!

11:55.674 --> 11:57.585
D'Argo, I heard a pulse blast.
-Move!

11:57.676 --> 11:59.007
Chiana:
Frell!

12:12.232 --> 12:15.065
Markir:
Hey!

12:15.152 --> 12:17.734
Hey, come on, you can't
leave me in here!

12:25.454 --> 12:27.285
You're a Peacekeeper?

12:28.415 --> 12:31.532
They beat me, they
took me hostage.

12:31.627 --> 12:33.163
You're a fugitive.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.993
I'm a member of the
Peacekeepers,

12:35.088 --> 12:38.455
and if you help me out of here
there'll be a big, big reward.

12:38.550 --> 12:41.257
What, 200 darcats for a tech?

12:41.345 --> 12:44.712
Those are escaped prisoners
you have on your ship.

12:44.806 --> 12:47.013
They're dangerous.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.840
Don't you care?

12:54.274 --> 12:57.437
No, not anymore.

14:21.153 --> 14:22.859
If this image has appeared,

14:22.946 --> 14:25.653
it means my mask has
reached its destination,

14:25.741 --> 14:27.857
and you have made
contact with it.

14:27.951 --> 14:30.442
I have a message for
you Crichton.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.448
For you alone.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.951
Listen. Listen.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.657
Crichton, there's a message...
-Pilot: Crichton,

14:36.752 --> 14:39.539
Moya has detected a signal.

14:39.629 --> 14:43.918
Lousy timing, Pilot.
Really lousy timing.
What kind of signal?

14:44.009 --> 14:47.126
A Peacekeeper distress signal.

14:47.971 --> 14:49.177
How close is it?

14:49.264 --> 14:53.132
Crichton, you don't understand.
The signal was sent from here.

14:53.226 --> 14:59.847
Somebody aboard Moya just
broadcast a distress call
to the Peacekeepers.

15:01.610 --> 15:04.101
Pilot, can you isolate the
source of the signal?

15:04.196 --> 15:07.780
Pilot:
It appears to have come from
Tier Seven or Eight.

15:07.866 --> 15:11.029
l have DRD's searching
there now.

15:11.119 --> 15:12.108
Has anyone answered it yet?

15:12.204 --> 15:14.365
We're not going to
give them time.

15:14.456 --> 15:18.199
Moya will initiate Starburst
in 100 microts.

15:18.293 --> 15:20.158
What about Talyn?

15:20.253 --> 15:23.871
Crais has ordered him
to Starburst alone on
a similar vector.

15:23.965 --> 15:27.128
Talyn will make contact as soon
as he can locate us.

15:27.219 --> 15:30.803
Why would anybody here want to
signal the Peacekeepers?

15:30.889 --> 15:32.925
What about the Tech?
He was a Peacekeeper.

15:33.016 --> 15:36.383
Chiana:
No, no, no, the Tech is kept
in a cell on Tier Eleven.

15:36.478 --> 15:38.264
I put my currency
on the Scarran.

15:38.355 --> 15:41.392
Well, normally, I'd agree with
you, but Naj Gil's been with
me the whole time.

15:41.483 --> 15:42.643
What about the Nebari?

15:42.734 --> 15:44.520
Hubero has never left my sight.

15:44.611 --> 15:49.230
Rygel:
And, uh, since she arrived,
sweet Orhnn has been atop me or, uh...

15:49.324 --> 15:51.189
beneath me, or...

15:51.284 --> 15:55.243
Okay, there's a mental Polaroid
we can all live without, Ryge.

15:55.330 --> 15:58.788
Okay, plan. We've gotta double
time prep on the Pod.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.615
We've gotta get them out of
here of here as soon as we can.

16:00.710 --> 16:03.497
And until we do we should lock
'em all up for safekeeping.
Agreed?

16:03.588 --> 16:06.625
No, John, I will not
imprison Naj Gil.

16:06.716 --> 16:08.877
He hasn't done anything wrong.

16:08.969 --> 16:10.334
He's going to stay with me.

16:10.428 --> 16:14.341
And Hubero never leaves my
sight, just like before.

16:14.432 --> 16:16.923
Rygel:
And Orhnn and I will
just be, uh...

16:17.018 --> 16:20.476
Crichton:
Be making the Hynerian with
two backs, trunks, whatever.

16:20.564 --> 16:25.024
Yeah, just remember one of them
sent the signal. Be careful.

16:25.902 --> 16:27.608
Be careful.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.991
Pilot:
Starbursting now.

16:50.302 --> 16:55.717
Crais:
According to Hubero's
rendering of the Boolite, this obviously goes here.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.468
Wrong.

16:57.559 --> 17:00.471
It's clearly vascular,
not skeletal.

17:00.562 --> 17:05.272
Put this piece there, attach
that piece to there, then there.

17:06.443 --> 17:09.276
Yes, well that would seem
to be correct.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.398
I was hoping that once we got
enough of him together

17:11.489 --> 17:13.901
that he would be able to tell
us how to do the rest.

17:13.992 --> 17:17.200
That's why I'm starting on the
head and the mouth first.

17:17.829 --> 17:20.946
Head and mouth?

17:21.041 --> 17:24.579
What, you don't think that
that's the head and
that's the mouth?

17:24.669 --> 17:28.207
Well, not unless he
sits on his mouth.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.676
Mag-stet.

17:46.024 --> 17:47.810
Turbo-sealer.

17:57.077 --> 17:59.238
Fluffy pink slippers.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.321
Donald Duck.

18:03.792 --> 18:05.202
Mickey Mouse.

18:07.045 --> 18:09.252
Huey, Louie and Dewey.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.260
You wanna talk?

18:21.768 --> 18:23.633
Okay, fine. No talking.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.810
No, you know what?

18:26.898 --> 18:29.105
I wanna talk.

18:31.403 --> 18:34.895
I had words with Crais and, um,

18:34.990 --> 18:38.198
he told me that you and
the other me...

18:42.205 --> 18:45.413
Actually, he didn't...

18:45.500 --> 18:48.333
tell me anything. He, um...

18:49.629 --> 18:51.665
told me to talk to you.

18:54.676 --> 18:57.292
So I assume...

19:01.349 --> 19:03.431
Aeryn, I'm sorry.

19:14.321 --> 19:16.403
Maybe you're right.

19:20.201 --> 19:22.533
Maybe we shouldn't talk.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.217
Want some advice?

19:40.305 --> 19:41.340
Nope.

20:01.242 --> 20:02.652
What?

20:05.997 --> 20:08.613
Oh, my friend, I...

20:10.543 --> 20:14.661
I don't know what to say. I
don't have any advice. It's
difficult, isn't it?

20:14.756 --> 20:19.671
You're jealous of the other
you, aren't you?

20:22.013 --> 20:23.924
He died.

20:25.475 --> 20:27.682
The other guy.

20:29.437 --> 20:31.268
The copy.

20:36.861 --> 20:39.603
Now Aeryn thinks that
you are the copy.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.286
( snoring )

21:03.388 --> 21:05.344
Hey, man. How you doin'?

21:05.432 --> 21:06.171
Crichton.

21:06.266 --> 21:07.676
Shh, Shh, Shh.

21:09.686 --> 21:12.052
What do you want?

21:12.147 --> 21:16.356
Their Transport Pod is stocked
and it's almost repaired.

21:16.443 --> 21:18.229
ls Barbarella ready to vamoose?

21:18.319 --> 21:22.437
I'm not sure I want her to go.

21:22.532 --> 21:24.568
In fact, I'm sure I don't.

21:24.659 --> 21:27.822
Rygel, look, I completely
understand.

21:27.912 --> 21:31.780
But you cannot let the little
appendage start telling the big
appendage what to do.

21:31.875 --> 21:36.619
John, I think I'm in
love with her.

21:36.713 --> 21:41.047
And I think she loves me.

21:41.134 --> 21:45.969
Well, that may be the best
reason of all to get her out of
here as quick as you can.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.546
You still got half an arn.

21:48.641 --> 21:49.892
(click sound )

21:51.394 --> 21:52.804
.s /

21:56.316 --> 21:58.227
I heard what you said.

21:59.444 --> 22:01.150
I didn't mean...

22:01.237 --> 22:04.320
I liked it, Rygie.

22:04.407 --> 22:06.648
Are you ready to go again, hmm?

22:06.743 --> 22:08.324
Again?

22:08.411 --> 22:10.322
We have half an em.

22:10.413 --> 22:13.871
I've heard Dominars
never need rest.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.619
(giggles )

22:15.710 --> 22:18.497
Rrrr... Growl like a blegzoon.

22:34.312 --> 22:36.018
So what'd you do?

22:37.607 --> 22:40.189
Why'd they imprison you?

22:40.276 --> 22:43.143
Actually, when the Peacekeepers
found me, they tried to
give me back.

22:43.238 --> 22:46.526
But Nebari Prime didn't want me.

22:46.616 --> 22:51.360
To them, I'm just another
mouth to feed in a
non-conformist colony.

22:53.373 --> 22:56.035
Non-conformist?
What? Why? What?

23:04.259 --> 23:06.045
(gasps )

23:06.928 --> 23:09.670
You're an... an...

23:09.764 --> 23:11.675
an... an androgen.

23:12.934 --> 23:15.801
Not exactly male, not
exactly female.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.510
Not exactly anything.

23:17.605 --> 23:22.099
When... when I was growing up,
I... l was told about
androgens and, I...

23:22.193 --> 23:23.308
but I, uh...

23:23.403 --> 23:26.520
but they were always taken
right after birth.

23:26.614 --> 23:29.902
I... I never met one.

23:29.993 --> 23:32.951
At least you didn't
think you ever did.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.787
What's happening?

23:45.258 --> 23:46.589
He's talking.

23:46.676 --> 23:48.382
Listen, listen...

23:48.845 --> 23:50.756
(gurgling)

23:52.890 --> 23:55.597
Traitor... traitor...

23:55.685 --> 23:58.301
Crais:
He keeps repeating the same
word over and over.

23:58.396 --> 23:59.727
Crichton:
Traitor.

23:59.814 --> 24:01.554
I bet he still thinks he's
on the Transport Pod.

24:01.649 --> 24:03.150
So the traitor...

24:03.234 --> 24:04.565
Was on the Pod.

24:06.112 --> 24:07.318
Can he hear us?

24:07.405 --> 24:09.987
(gurgling):
Yes.

24:10.074 --> 24:12.451
Wow. There's an ear in here
somewhere.

24:12.535 --> 24:15.698
Okay, this is a little too
Naked Lunch.

24:17.373 --> 24:20.206
Can you tell us who
the traitor is?

24:21.878 --> 24:26.838
I... I don't remember...

24:26.924 --> 24:28.880
Crais:
I've used all the brain matter
we've found so far.

24:28.968 --> 24:33.052
It's possible the part of
his memory that holds
the answer isn't here.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.380
Either that, or we're tracking
it all over the ship
with our shoes.

24:35.475 --> 24:36.760
Pilot:
Shots fired!

24:36.851 --> 24:39.092
Shots fired!
-Shots where?

24:39.187 --> 24:42.520
Pilot, it's D'Argo. I'm in the
Center Chamber! Naj Gil
has been shot!

24:43.316 --> 24:44.897
Aeryn:
What happened?

24:44.984 --> 24:46.485
We were in the Center Chamber.
He heard a noise and came out.

24:46.569 --> 24:48.355
There was a pulse blast....
-Direction?

24:48.446 --> 24:50.437
I don't know. By the I came
out, it was all gone.

24:50.531 --> 24:52.567
Can you get me something
to stop the bleeding?

24:57.330 --> 24:58.445
Chiana:
I knew it. I knew it.

24:58.539 --> 24:59.790
Igot him.

24:59.874 --> 25:01.580
I knew... I knew someone
was gonna get shot.

25:01.668 --> 25:03.124
Pip, that is no help
to us right now.

25:03.211 --> 25:05.327
If you can tell us who did it,
that might be useful.

25:05.421 --> 25:06.877
Perhaps you know!

25:06.964 --> 25:08.750
No! l have no idea!

25:08.841 --> 25:10.797
Well, think hard.

25:10.885 --> 25:12.125
Leave her alone!

25:12.220 --> 25:14.336
(laughing)

25:14.430 --> 25:16.216
What's all the noise about?

25:17.725 --> 25:19.135
Where've you been?

25:19.227 --> 25:21.183
Let go of her,
you lunatic Luxan.

25:21.270 --> 25:23.226
She's never left my side.

25:23.314 --> 25:25.930
D'Argo, that's not helping, man.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.731
One of them has to have done it.

25:27.819 --> 25:29.434
Not Hubero.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.233
She's been with me
the whole time.

25:32.323 --> 25:36.191
And I've been with Orhnn.
Release her now.

25:38.413 --> 25:39.698
D'Argo!

25:50.633 --> 25:53.170
Get us away from this welnitz.

25:54.887 --> 25:57.048
I agree.

25:57.140 --> 26:00.303
There's too much dren in
this room. Come on.

26:00.768 --> 26:02.178
Chiana...

26:02.270 --> 26:04.306
Pilot:
There's been another signal.

26:04.397 --> 26:05.147
What?!

26:05.231 --> 26:07.688
DRDs are trying to
find the source.

26:07.775 --> 26:09.151
Pilot, Starburst.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.692
Moya can't, not for another arn.

26:11.779 --> 26:13.770
And this signal,

26:13.865 --> 26:16.857
it sent out Moya's coordinates.

26:16.951 --> 26:19.192
Who the hell is doing this?

26:29.964 --> 26:32.046
This is the signaling device.

26:32.133 --> 26:36.672
DRDs found it attached to a
neural cluster on Tier Eight.

26:36.763 --> 26:39.175
Can you tell whose it is?

26:39.265 --> 26:42.553
It's constructed of parts
easily found in Moya,

26:42.643 --> 26:46.886
but it required an impressive
technical knowledge to assemble.

26:59.076 --> 27:00.156
Anything?

27:00.244 --> 27:03.532
Markir:
It hasn't moved.

27:03.623 --> 27:06.410
Nor have I, if that's what
you're wondering.

27:06.501 --> 27:08.287
Pilot, can you confirm that?

27:08.377 --> 27:12.336
The DRD has sensed no movement.

27:17.887 --> 27:20.128
Is something wrong?

27:20.223 --> 27:22.680
Pilot, how long before their
Transport Pod is repaired?

27:22.767 --> 27:26.225
The DRDs will finish
within a half arn.

27:26.312 --> 27:29.520
Correction: a quarter arn.

27:29.607 --> 27:33.020
We'll have you off this boat
as soon as we can.

27:39.200 --> 27:42.442
Rygel, Chiana, listen up.

27:42.537 --> 27:46.280
Unless we got a Tech who can
walk through walls or
hypnotize DRDs,

27:46.374 --> 27:49.036
the bad guy's got to be
with one of you.

27:49.126 --> 27:52.368
Now, we are not going to
hurt anybody,

27:52.463 --> 27:56.547
but their transport is almost
fixed, so we'll load 'em
with supplies

27:56.634 --> 28:01.219
and send them to a very
friendly Commerce Planet.

28:01.305 --> 28:04.797
Everybody goes their
own way. Okay?

28:05.935 --> 28:07.471
Crichton:
Pip?

28:08.980 --> 28:10.561
Sparky?

28:11.440 --> 28:13.021
Okay?

28:14.360 --> 28:15.975
Damn it!

28:16.070 --> 28:17.401
The others can leave.

28:17.488 --> 28:19.570
You'll stay.

28:19.657 --> 28:21.147
And then?

28:21.242 --> 28:24.826
And then, Orhnn, dear Orhnn...

28:24.912 --> 28:29.281
( chuckles )
there are many things
we must talk about.

28:29.375 --> 28:32.208
Do we have to talk
about them now?

28:32.295 --> 28:33.580
Mmm... oh!

28:33.671 --> 28:34.706
(giggles )

28:34.797 --> 28:37.083
Again. Here.

28:37.174 --> 28:39.165
(weary sigh )

28:40.678 --> 28:41.713
(slight groan)

28:41.804 --> 28:44.295
I've managed to stop
the bleeding,

28:44.390 --> 28:47.177
but I know even less about
Scarrans than I do Boolites.

28:47.268 --> 28:49.509
I mean, I thought these guys
were virtually impenetrable.

28:49.604 --> 28:53.142
Yeah, but the skin hadn't
fully healed from the removal
of the heat gland.

28:53.232 --> 28:57.316
Whoever shot him knew
exactly where to aim.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.268
Pilot, any sign of
Rygel or Chiana?

28:59.363 --> 29:00.478
Nothing.

29:00.573 --> 29:03.440
They are still not responding
to their Comms.

29:21.427 --> 29:22.291
Aeryn.

29:22.386 --> 29:24.001
What?

29:25.890 --> 29:28.302
Crichton, he, uh...

29:28.935 --> 29:30.891
D'Argo...

29:31.979 --> 29:33.970
don't.

30:03.135 --> 30:07.674
When they finally find us
they'll be angry at you
for hiding me.

30:07.765 --> 30:09.426
They get angry at me a lot.

30:09.517 --> 30:11.303
Do you trust Crichton?

30:11.394 --> 30:14.932
Would he really allow us to
leave on a Transport Pod?

30:15.022 --> 30:17.104
Yeah, I trust him.

30:18.109 --> 30:20.350
But you really want to leave?

30:20.444 --> 30:25.108
Chiana, I don't want to cause
you any trouble.

30:25.199 --> 30:28.157
I'll wait in the Transport Pod
until it's fixed.

30:30.329 --> 30:34.072
W-Wait-wait, wh-whoever shot
you will be in the Pod.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.122
What are you talking about?
I haven't been shot.

30:36.210 --> 30:38.166
H... I mean Naj Gil.

30:38.254 --> 30:39.790
Whoever shot...

30:40.423 --> 30:41.503
Hubero!

30:41.590 --> 30:43.046
Hubero, wait!

30:43.134 --> 30:45.420
( crackling )

30:46.387 --> 30:49.470
Traitor...

30:52.476 --> 30:53.932
What's he saying?

30:54.020 --> 30:56.352
Beauty...

30:57.440 --> 30:59.146
So...

30:59.233 --> 31:02.475
so beautiful...

31:17.585 --> 31:19.496
(panting)

31:36.020 --> 31:38.727
(ticking )

31:44.445 --> 31:45.525
More pulse fire!

31:45.613 --> 31:48.901
The DRD watching the
Peacekeeper Tech has gone dead,

31:48.991 --> 31:51.027
and the cell door's open.

31:51.118 --> 31:52.449
On my way, Pilot!

31:52.536 --> 31:53.867
Get the DRDs searching.

31:53.954 --> 31:55.330
She...

31:55.414 --> 31:57.996
betrayed... us.

31:58.084 --> 31:59.324
"She"?

32:00.044 --> 32:02.126
On Pod...

32:02.213 --> 32:06.422
I caught her making a
deal with Tech.

32:08.928 --> 32:11.135
Crais:
The name of the traitor?

32:11.847 --> 32:13.303
Name?

32:14.433 --> 32:15.297
Wake up!

32:15.392 --> 32:16.643
Wake up now!

32:29.240 --> 32:33.074
We really need you to move
your ass now!

32:33.160 --> 32:34.240
Huh?

32:34.328 --> 32:37.820
I'm afraid I must insist.

32:42.211 --> 32:44.668
Rygel, Chiana, it's Orhnn.
She sent the signals!

32:44.755 --> 32:46.086
Chiana:
I got you, Crichton.

32:46.173 --> 32:47.504
Hubero and I are heading
to the Maintenance Bay.

32:47.591 --> 32:50.173
D'Argo:
Keep your eyes out.
Orhnn must have shot Naj Gil.

32:50.261 --> 32:52.502
And let the Tech loose.
Rygel, are you hearing this?

32:52.596 --> 32:53.711
Move!

32:53.806 --> 32:54.761
D'Argo:
Rygel!

32:54.849 --> 32:56.555
Why, Orhnn? Why?

32:56.642 --> 32:59.475
You were a prisoner of the
Peacekeepers like the
rest of us.

32:59.562 --> 33:04.977
Because, my dear gullible
Dominar, the odds of
staying free stunk.

33:05.067 --> 33:07.023
So, I struck a deal
with the Tech.

33:07.111 --> 33:10.069
B-B-But when you were on Moya,
you were free.

33:10.156 --> 33:14.490
For how long? I don't want to
spend my life running from
the Peacekeepers.

33:14.577 --> 33:18.445
And once I got here, I found a
superb bargaining chip: you.

33:18.539 --> 33:22.157
They'll be far more interested
in recapturing a full royal

33:22.251 --> 33:25.789
than a lowly soldier
like myself.

33:25.880 --> 33:27.836
You're a soldier?

33:27.923 --> 33:30.255
You might not have deigned to
take pleasure with me

33:30.342 --> 33:32.674
if you'd known I was a
common soldier.

33:32.761 --> 33:36.299
And I needed you to take
pleasure so you would
fall asleep

33:36.390 --> 33:38.802
and I could roam the ship.

33:38.893 --> 33:41.726
It was unfortunate that
the Scarran saw me.

33:41.812 --> 33:43.723
But you slept, too.

33:43.814 --> 33:46.556
All Hynerians sleep
deeply after...

33:46.650 --> 33:48.151
pleasure.
( chuckles )

33:48.235 --> 33:52.148
The "pleasure," Dominar,
was all yours.

33:53.157 --> 33:55.523
You were... faking?

33:55.618 --> 33:58.325
Oh, males.

33:58.662 --> 33:59.822
Move it!

34:01.999 --> 34:03.205
You seen Aeryn?

34:03.292 --> 34:06.125
One tier down. The DRD's are
searching all the other tiers.

34:06.212 --> 34:07.668
( rumbling )
What the hell was that?

34:07.755 --> 34:10.838
Pilot:
Somebody has neutralized
Moya's calorics.

34:10.925 --> 34:13.382
We're unable to move.

34:13.469 --> 34:15.255
They're going to make a run
for it and they got Rygel.

34:15.346 --> 34:18.884
Rygel could be going
voluntarily.
-And maybe he's not.

34:20.976 --> 34:23.683
You're not really going to
leave the Boolite here
like this, are you?

34:23.771 --> 34:26.057
Under the circumstances,
he can wait.

34:26.148 --> 34:27.934
I'm going to assist
in the search.

34:28.025 --> 34:29.686
Uh, uh...
( clears throat)

34:29.777 --> 34:32.143
For me?

34:33.322 --> 34:34.107
(yells)

34:34.198 --> 34:35.438
Get down!

34:35.532 --> 34:37.238
Orhnn!

34:37.326 --> 34:39.692
Help!

34:39.787 --> 34:41.118
( screams )

34:41.205 --> 34:42.786
Orhnn, Let's do it!

34:42.873 --> 34:44.784
Help!

34:45.793 --> 34:47.579
Markir:
Orhnn!

34:47.670 --> 34:48.580
Markir:
Orhnn!

34:48.671 --> 34:50.536
Jool:
Don't throw that!

34:50.631 --> 34:52.246
No!!

34:58.597 --> 34:59.256
(gasps )

34:59.348 --> 35:00.463
Orhnn:
Shut up!

35:00.557 --> 35:02.388
Shut up, Dominar!

35:02.476 --> 35:03.511
Shut up!

35:03.602 --> 35:06.810
Whoa, Chiana, don't shoot!
It's me!

35:06.897 --> 35:08.353
Down!

35:08.440 --> 35:10.726
Hubero, down!

35:10.818 --> 35:12.308
( screaming )

35:13.404 --> 35:14.769
(gasping)

35:15.948 --> 35:18.655
( choking )

35:23.414 --> 35:25.325
(weapon fires )
(gasps )

35:25.874 --> 35:26.784
Oh!

35:27.876 --> 35:29.377
( shouting )

35:31.255 --> 35:32.370
Crais!

35:35.175 --> 35:36.039
Ahh!

35:38.345 --> 35:39.175
Ahh! Crais!

35:39.263 --> 35:40.343
Crais!

35:42.224 --> 35:43.339
Help!

35:47.688 --> 35:48.643
(yells)

35:48.731 --> 35:49.561
( screams )

35:53.152 --> 35:54.892
( screaming )

35:55.779 --> 35:57.315
Ah, prong-prong!

35:58.907 --> 36:00.408
( screaming )

36:01.160 --> 36:04.527
(gurgling scream)

36:04.621 --> 36:06.953
( both screaming )

36:08.417 --> 36:12.080
(wailing raspingly)

36:12.171 --> 36:14.287
( revving )

36:14.381 --> 36:16.087
Go! Go! Go! Go!

36:17.968 --> 36:19.799
Crichton! Crichton!

36:20.596 --> 36:22.211
They've got Rygel!

36:22.306 --> 36:24.137
Pilot, close the outer
hanger doors!

36:24.224 --> 36:25.555
Pilot:
I can't.

36:25.642 --> 36:28.258
Moya's connection has
been severed.

36:28.354 --> 36:30.265
I've got an idea.
-I've got an idea.

36:35.486 --> 36:38.398
Begin broadcasting our location
to the Peacekeepers.

36:44.495 --> 36:46.031
We had the same idea.

36:46.121 --> 36:48.237
No, Iwanted to take
your module.

36:48.332 --> 36:50.072
You didn't know D'Argo
could fly this.

36:50.167 --> 36:53.000
Frelling dren!
There's a ship gaining on us.

36:56.048 --> 36:57.458
Any word from Talyn?

36:57.549 --> 37:00.131
Crais:
Negative. He still hasn't
caught up with us yet.

37:00.219 --> 37:02.426
Okay, we're going in.

37:05.849 --> 37:07.350
They won't shoot us down
with him aboard.

37:07.434 --> 37:10.926
( laughs )
I wouldn't be so sure
about that.

37:14.525 --> 37:16.356
Opening rear hatch.

37:21.115 --> 37:22.195
They're right above us.

37:22.282 --> 37:23.863
What's their plan?

37:23.951 --> 37:26.442
Oh, they're going to
kill you, bitch.

37:26.537 --> 37:28.323
Aeryn:
Right, D'Argo.
Your position is good.

37:28.414 --> 37:30.245
I will fire close to the hatch.

37:30.332 --> 37:32.243
Put this on.

37:32.334 --> 37:33.323
Keep it steady, D'Argo.

37:33.419 --> 37:35.284
I'm trying.

37:35.379 --> 37:36.164
Steady.

37:36.255 --> 37:37.665
This cable gonna hold?

37:37.756 --> 37:39.747
It's irradium alloy;
of course it'll hold.

37:39.842 --> 37:41.082
Just like the budong.

37:41.176 --> 37:43.508
Budong? What are you
talking about?
-You...

37:46.306 --> 37:48.262
Just follow my lead.

37:54.857 --> 37:56.267
Go now, Aeryn! Go!

37:56.358 --> 37:57.973
Oh, this'll be fun.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.615
They're on the hull!

38:11.457 --> 38:12.162
Yeah?

38:12.249 --> 38:13.284
Yeah.

38:13.375 --> 38:15.206
( beeping )

38:17.421 --> 38:18.911
(yelling)

38:22.342 --> 38:23.843
Coming in!

38:25.387 --> 38:26.217
Shoot them!

38:26.305 --> 38:28.091
Shoot them!

38:28.182 --> 38:29.513
(weapons firing )

38:31.435 --> 38:32.641
Stay down!

38:38.108 --> 38:39.769
( screaming )

38:41.028 --> 38:41.983
Rygel!

38:42.070 --> 38:43.901
( screaming )

38:43.989 --> 38:45.354
Crichton:
I got you, Sparky!

38:45.449 --> 38:46.359
Help me, Rygie!

38:46.450 --> 38:47.565
( Rygel grunting )

38:47.659 --> 38:49.069
Aeryn, I got him!

38:49.161 --> 38:49.911
Good.

38:49.995 --> 38:51.235
Hey, Rygie...

38:51.330 --> 38:55.118
what... what is... going... on?!

38:55.209 --> 38:58.872
( loud, sustained scream )

39:00.130 --> 39:01.119
(gasps )

39:01.215 --> 39:04.503
Hey, Buckwheat. How you doin'?

39:04.593 --> 39:09.337
I will not be taken to task for
having a trusting nature.

39:09.431 --> 39:10.386
( breathing heavily)

39:10.474 --> 39:12.214
(screaming)
Rygie! -

39:12.309 --> 39:14.049
Ah, women.

39:14.144 --> 39:16.055
D'Argo:
Talyn's back. He's found us.

39:16.146 --> 39:18.137
Aeryn:
Tell Talyn to steer clear.

39:18.232 --> 39:19.972
The Tech hit the cell drive.

39:20.067 --> 39:23.525
This Pod is gonna blow.
We've gotta go, now.

39:23.612 --> 39:25.352
( beeping )

39:25.989 --> 39:27.274
Now, D'Argo!

39:40.754 --> 39:43.791
Hologram Crichton:
It's all in my head,

39:43.882 --> 39:46.214
which means it's in yours, too.

39:47.302 --> 39:50.385
Wormholes, A to Z.

39:53.308 --> 39:57.551
You've probably already heard
what we did with it,

39:58.855 --> 40:01.062
and that's just the beginning.

40:01.984 --> 40:04.851
You could fry a whole
solar system.

40:05.445 --> 40:06.855
Heh.

40:09.074 --> 40:13.534
Furlow is still out there,
somewhere,

40:13.620 --> 40:16.987
but for right now, the Scarrans
are back to square one.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.908
Peacekeepers.

40:21.753 --> 40:24.005
They're your problem.

40:26.258 --> 40:27.668
Look at me.

40:30.929 --> 40:33.341
Now look at yourself.

40:40.439 --> 40:41.895
You know.

40:45.444 --> 40:47.400
Don't let Scorpius crack this.

40:48.405 --> 40:50.441
Whatever it takes.

40:57.164 --> 40:59.200
Okay.

41:00.292 --> 41:04.956
I'm gonna piss you
off now, man.

41:08.634 --> 41:10.295
Be smart.

41:12.929 --> 41:15.466
Don't push her.

41:21.313 --> 41:26.273
She takes... time.

41:34.701 --> 41:37.738
Oh, one more thing.

41:56.306 --> 41:58.092
( laughs )

42:05.816 --> 42:08.182
Good luck, John.

42:35.095 --> 42:37.211
Crichton:
So that's what I'm doing.

42:37.305 --> 42:40.342
You don't have to come along.
You don't have to like it.

42:40.434 --> 42:42.425
I just want you to know.

42:46.273 --> 42:50.141
Moya and l are against
this idea in totality.

42:50.235 --> 42:55.446
I'm sure Captain Crais is aware
that Talyn resists also.

42:55.532 --> 42:58.820
Chiana:
You don't know how far Scorpius
is in his wormhole research.

42:58.910 --> 43:00.525
You don't know where he keeps
it. You don't know anything.

43:00.620 --> 43:02.326
How you going to stop him?

43:06.168 --> 43:08.204
I'll pass, if you don't mind.

43:08.295 --> 43:11.537
Why are you wearing
an eyepatch?

43:11.631 --> 43:13.132
Boolite in my eye.

43:13.216 --> 43:15.207
Why are you such a moron?

43:15.302 --> 43:16.758
( snarling )

43:16.845 --> 43:18.381
Crichton:
Guys.

43:23.435 --> 43:26.643
I don't see another option.

43:26.730 --> 43:28.641
Scorpius has the knowledge
from my brain

43:28.732 --> 43:31.895
and I'm not gonna let him
shaft the universe with it.

44:13.944 --> 44:15.559
You're all gonna die.

44:18.657 --> 44:21.364
You see that one, Pip,
or you just guessing?

44:25.163 --> 44:27.370
We choose our own path.

44:30.418 --> 44:33.125
This one is mine.

44:33.213 --> 44:35.750
I'm going to the
Command Carrier.

44:41.096 --> 44:43.929
I'm going to stop Scorpius.
