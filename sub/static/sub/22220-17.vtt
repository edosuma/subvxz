WEBVTT

00:03.296 --> 00:07.289
Until then, I am leaving Moya
at the next planet with
shipping traffic.

00:07.383 --> 00:08.998
Pass me those and don't
help yourself.

00:09.093 --> 00:11.209
We are stronger as the sum
of our parts, kids.

00:11.304 --> 00:14.011
We are under no obligation to
function as a unit, John.

00:14.098 --> 00:17.261
Yeah, I understand that.
We all have separate goals.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.342
But... ugh!

00:19.437 --> 00:22.304
Oh, sala manila, what
the hell is that?

00:22.398 --> 00:23.638
That's krawldar.

00:23.733 --> 00:26.270
A delicacy, even for pagans.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.646
Yeah? How long was it under
your butt getting delicate?

00:28.738 --> 00:31.354
Aeryn:
Wait a minute. Whatever the
rest of you decide, |wi|| not abandon Moya.

00:31.449 --> 00:33.280
Crichton:
Good.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.073
D'Argo:
Suit yourself. You've got
nowhere to go anyway.

00:35.161 --> 00:37.652
I must confess my consternation
at agreeing with D'Argo.

00:37.747 --> 00:41.331
But if Moya is no longer able
to Starburst then we are
all at risk.

00:41.417 --> 00:43.032
Mmm? Can I say something?

00:43.127 --> 00:44.708
Everyone else:
No!

00:44.795 --> 00:47.787
Look, Moya has been very good
to us and now you want
to abandon her?

00:47.882 --> 00:49.622
I want to see my son.

00:49.717 --> 00:52.424
And that is not likely to
happen aboard a pregnant
bio-mechanoid ship.

00:52.511 --> 00:54.297
Zhaan:
Rygel, what do you think?

00:54.388 --> 00:57.676
Rygel:
Well, Moya has been, for as
long as I can remember,

00:57.767 --> 01:03.228
our protector, our home, our
companion and our friend.

01:03.314 --> 01:04.554
Crichton:
Amen.

01:04.649 --> 01:07.186
However, as relationships grow,
they also change.

01:07.276 --> 01:10.188
Do you think we can trade her
for a faster vessel?

01:10.279 --> 01:12.190
Moya is not a possession,
your lowness.

01:12.281 --> 01:14.021
(hissing)

01:14.116 --> 01:17.734
If you ignore the messenger,
which is effortless, the
message is sound.

01:17.828 --> 01:20.240
Perhaps we have outgrown
our usefulness of...

01:20.331 --> 01:24.199
Look, who made this shellack?

01:26.879 --> 01:30.997
Moya is protecting her baby,
D'Argo. Do you blame her?

01:31.092 --> 01:33.674
That is selfishness
masquerading as reason.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.501
He's right, you know.

01:35.596 --> 01:38.554
We all want to leave the
Uncharted Territories and
return home, but you...

01:38.641 --> 01:40.552
Yes, you would be more
content to stay.

01:40.643 --> 01:45.012
I want to get home as badly as
anybody else and this is where
the wormholes are.

01:45.106 --> 01:46.221
Fine. So, stay.

01:46.315 --> 01:48.101
But be honest about your
motives, Crichton.

01:48.192 --> 01:49.307
Oh, I'm sorry. You're on
their side now?

01:49.402 --> 01:50.517
No.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.112
I know I just got here, but can
I please say something?

01:52.196 --> 01:54.312
Everyone else:
No!

01:54.407 --> 01:58.650
Pilot:
Excuse the intrusion, but Moya
and I would like a word about your deliberations.

01:58.744 --> 02:00.951
That's what I been trying
to tell you guys.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.245
The DRDs have ears.

02:03.332 --> 02:06.074
No wonder you guys have been
flying around in circles.

02:06.168 --> 02:09.376
Moya is aware of your concerns
over her condition

02:09.463 --> 02:12.626
and regrets not being more
responsive to your needs.

02:12.717 --> 02:15.584
Please don't misunderstand,
Pilot. We simply...

02:15.678 --> 02:18.795
Do not wish to be captured
because of her pregnancy.

02:18.889 --> 02:20.049
Yes.

02:20.141 --> 02:21.347
We're just having a
discussion, Pilot.

02:21.434 --> 02:24.301
That includes thoughts of
abandoning us.

02:24.395 --> 02:25.851
You want us to stay?

02:25.938 --> 02:27.553
Of course.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.435
We are most fulfilled when
serving others.

02:30.526 --> 02:33.108
Your presence is gratifying
and comforting.

02:33.195 --> 02:35.106
Let us talk a little while
longer, Pilot.

02:35.197 --> 02:37.108
Your points are well-taken.

02:37.199 --> 02:41.738
You may talk all you want,
but please prepare for
immediate Starburst.

02:41.829 --> 02:44.946
l..l thought Moya couldn't
Starburst for another 50 arns.

02:45.041 --> 02:46.326
Her energy is low.

02:46.417 --> 02:49.705
However, she shares your
concerns about being recaptured

02:49.795 --> 02:52.707
and wishes to prove to you all
that she is capable.

02:52.798 --> 02:55.130
Uh, no, that..that won't be
necessary, Pilot.

02:55.217 --> 02:58.004
Starburst in five microts.

03:11.317 --> 03:15.230
D'Argo:
Now, this really is incredible.

03:15.321 --> 03:16.982
Rygel:
My favourite on the table.

03:17.073 --> 03:20.281
Aeryn:
What? Smoked pronga sinew.
It's quite easy to make, really.

03:22.203 --> 03:24.194
( explosion )

03:24.288 --> 03:25.323
Whoa!

03:36.467 --> 03:38.799
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut...

03:38.886 --> 03:42.003
...a radiation wave hit and I
got shot through a wormhole...

03:42.098 --> 03:44.885
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

03:44.975 --> 03:48.308
a living ship full of strange
alien life-forms...

03:48.396 --> 03:49.351
Help me...

03:49.438 --> 03:50.723
Listen, please.

03:50.815 --> 03:52.806
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

03:52.900 --> 03:56.859
...being hunted by an insane
military commander...

03:56.946 --> 03:59.312
...doing everything I can...

03:59.407 --> 04:01.864
I'm just looking for
a way home.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.253
(rumbling)

04:26.642 --> 04:28.098
You all right?

04:28.185 --> 04:29.345
We must've hit something.

04:29.437 --> 04:31.223
ln Starburst?

04:32.106 --> 04:32.970
Ugh.

04:33.065 --> 04:34.225
What's that noise?

04:34.316 --> 04:36.773
Chiana:
Zhaanl Zhaanl Are you okay?

04:36.861 --> 04:39.773
It's my arm.
The fibers are torn.

04:39.864 --> 04:41.229
Pilot, what's happening?

04:41.991 --> 04:43.197
Crichton:
Pilot?

04:43.284 --> 04:44.945
Pilot!

04:45.035 --> 04:46.241
Pilot!

04:48.330 --> 04:50.412
I'm all right, Chiana.
l'll heal.

04:50.499 --> 04:51.614
Where's Rygel?

04:51.709 --> 04:52.994
-Rygel?
-Where is he?

04:53.085 --> 04:54.461
Rygell

04:55.796 --> 04:57.377
What the hell is that?

05:01.093 --> 05:02.469
I'll check Command.

05:02.553 --> 05:04.134
You look after Pilot and you...

05:04.221 --> 05:06.052
you do damage assessment.

05:13.647 --> 05:14.978
D'Argol

05:15.065 --> 05:16.521
D'Argo?

05:16.609 --> 05:19.100
He can't just disappear
like that.

05:19.195 --> 05:21.106
Pilot or Command?

05:21.197 --> 05:22.528
Command.

05:22.615 --> 05:24.697
You, fix her arm and then
straight to Command.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.034
Go.

05:30.372 --> 05:31.987
Aeryn!

05:33.167 --> 05:34.156
Zhaan:
John, what's happening?

05:34.251 --> 05:36.287
ldon't want to die.

05:41.258 --> 05:42.919
Pilot, are you there?

05:43.010 --> 05:44.125
Crichton,

05:44.220 --> 05:45.209
where are the others?

05:45.304 --> 05:46.589
You tell me. What happened?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.090
I'm unsure.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.547
Still running analysis.

05:49.642 --> 05:50.927
Is that a star?

05:51.018 --> 05:54.636
Unknown. Attempting to close
radiation filters...

05:54.730 --> 05:55.936
now.

05:56.023 --> 05:59.140
D'Argo, Aeryn and Rygel
have disappeared.

05:59.235 --> 06:01.021
What happened?
Did we hit something?

06:01.111 --> 06:02.146
Still unknown.

06:02.238 --> 06:03.648
Quantify "disappeared."

06:03.739 --> 06:05.275
Here one second, gone the next.

06:05.366 --> 06:07.402
Disa-Elvis has left the
building-appeared.

06:07.493 --> 06:09.324
These readings are
all over the map.

06:09.411 --> 06:12.198
Whatever's happened, most
systems are out.

06:12.289 --> 06:14.450
Propulsion, guidance, comms.

06:14.542 --> 06:17.284
Even my DRDs aren't responding.

06:17.378 --> 06:20.290
This is nuts. Nothing seems to
be working. How's Moya?

06:20.381 --> 06:23.418
Frightened, and in great pain.

06:24.218 --> 06:26.174
What is that out there?

06:26.262 --> 06:30.221
I will labor to discover that
once the DRDs reestablish
internal tracking.

06:30.307 --> 06:36.018
| show Rygel on Tier Eight and
Officer Sun in Maintenance
Bay Three.

06:36.105 --> 06:37.470
Still searching for D'Argo.

06:37.565 --> 06:38.975
Keep looking.

06:41.402 --> 06:42.482
I said no, Chiana!

06:42.570 --> 06:44.276
You can't stop me.

06:44.363 --> 06:46.069
I know how to fly a Transport
Pod, and I'm getting
off this ship.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.942
Not without everyone else,
you're not.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.148
How's the arm?

06:49.243 --> 06:51.234
Oh, useless until the
fibres regenerate.

06:51.328 --> 06:52.943
Pilot's found Aeryn and Rygel.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.949
Does he know what's happening?

06:55.040 --> 06:57.247
Not yet, and he's still a
little freaked out, so he could
probably use some company.

06:57.334 --> 06:59.165
Okay, I'll go straight
to the den.

06:59.253 --> 07:01.164
Whoa! The comms don't work.

07:01.255 --> 07:03.337
Rygel is on Tier Eight.
You'll have to find him on foot.

07:03.424 --> 07:05.164
Me?! Get frelled.

07:05.259 --> 07:08.797
Listen sunshine, you want
to be part of this crew?

07:08.887 --> 07:10.263
On your good days.

07:10.347 --> 07:13.384
This is one of the good days.

07:13.475 --> 07:16.308
I thought you were junior Miss
Tough Chick of the Universe.

07:16.395 --> 07:20.138
Yeah, when I can kiss or kick
or cry my way out of it.

07:20.232 --> 07:22.097
This is way, way, way, way
different.

07:22.192 --> 07:24.148
You bet your ass it is.

07:24.236 --> 07:30.323
And Pilot can't get the outer
doors open, so you can fly that
pod around on its pad.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.322
Chiana,

07:35.414 --> 07:37.154
it's going to be okay.

07:37.249 --> 07:39.080
Pilot's on the job.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.498
Tier Eight?

07:43.589 --> 07:44.795
Rygel.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.128
Crichton:
Aeryn!

07:54.308 --> 07:56.924
Aeryn, where are you?

07:59.229 --> 08:01.686
Oh come on, Aeryn.

08:02.566 --> 08:05.057
Give me some kind of sign.

08:11.659 --> 08:15.197
(rumbling)

08:32.054 --> 08:33.419
Pilot!

08:35.474 --> 08:37.305
Aeryn, are you here?

08:37.393 --> 08:38.223
(groaning)

08:38.310 --> 08:41.177
What the hell is this light?

08:41.814 --> 08:43.520
(groaning)

08:53.325 --> 08:55.532
( garbled ):
Aeryn!

08:56.120 --> 08:57.826
Pilot!

08:57.913 --> 08:59.278
Zhaanl

09:33.949 --> 09:35.905
Pilot...

09:40.497 --> 09:42.704
( garbled ):
Pilot?

09:44.960 --> 09:47.076
Pilot.

10:18.786 --> 10:21.368
Is anybody here?

10:22.623 --> 10:25.285
Come on, is anybody here?

10:30.214 --> 10:33.081
(groaning)

10:45.521 --> 10:47.182
Crichton...

10:47.272 --> 10:49.012
(gasping)

10:49.107 --> 10:50.938
Crichton!

10:51.026 --> 10:52.391
(gasping)

10:52.486 --> 10:55.819
l... I can't... I can't...

10:57.366 --> 10:58.981
Crichton...

11:17.344 --> 11:19.335
That's the same noise...

11:19.429 --> 11:23.798
That's the same noise as
the Maintenance Bay.

11:28.313 --> 11:29.928
(grunts)

11:35.279 --> 11:40.069
(grating, high-pitched
whine throughout)

12:08.937 --> 12:10.928
(obscured by whine):
Aeryn!

12:16.778 --> 12:19.190
Aeryn!

12:20.032 --> 12:22.193
What the hell?

12:27.122 --> 12:28.328
Aeryn?

12:28.415 --> 12:30.497
Hey. Whoa! Whoa!

12:30.584 --> 12:33.041
Whoa! You almost gave
me a heart attack!

12:33.128 --> 12:34.629
You okay?

12:36.214 --> 12:38.045
Can you hear me?

12:39.384 --> 12:40.248
Nothing.

12:40.344 --> 12:42.835
You. You all right? You okay?

12:42.930 --> 12:45.216
My head's hurting.

12:45.307 --> 12:46.922
Yeah. Yeah.

12:47.017 --> 12:49.349
Have you found D'Argo?

12:49.436 --> 12:50.596
What?

12:55.317 --> 12:56.523
D'Argo!

12:58.779 --> 13:00.019
No, I haven't.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.274
Have you seen...

13:05.202 --> 13:06.817
Rygel?

13:10.749 --> 13:12.364
Come with me.

13:15.379 --> 13:18.746
There are doors between
the Moyas.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.501
This way.

13:21.051 --> 13:22.416
Come on.

13:23.929 --> 13:25.920
Watch. Watch.

13:36.525 --> 13:38.015
Crap!

13:38.110 --> 13:39.270
What?

13:41.530 --> 13:42.736
Yeah.

13:42.823 --> 13:45.235
"Look for D'Argo."

13:45.325 --> 13:47.816
Yeah. Rygel. Yeah.

13:52.207 --> 13:55.540
(grating whine continues)

13:59.047 --> 14:01.379
(roaring)

14:08.348 --> 14:10.839
(roaring)

15:22.422 --> 15:24.378
Aerynll

15:42.818 --> 15:45.355
(shrieking):
Aeryn!

15:46.613 --> 15:48.569
Well, look at you!

15:48.657 --> 15:50.238
( bellowing with laughter)

15:50.325 --> 15:51.565
Rygel.

15:51.660 --> 15:53.571
(laughing continuously)

15:59.960 --> 16:01.621
Yellow light.

16:01.711 --> 16:03.576
Doesn't hurt. Can hear.

16:03.672 --> 16:05.208
This is..this is good.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.254
(continues laughing)

16:07.342 --> 16:08.798
What'd so damn funny?

16:08.885 --> 16:10.216
You. You.

16:10.303 --> 16:13.841
You're making less sense than
usual, but in a cute way.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.547
"Cute"?

16:15.642 --> 16:17.803
I don't know what you've been
smoking, buckwheat,

16:17.894 --> 16:19.270
but we've got a serious
problem here.

16:19.354 --> 16:21.640
Nothing a good meal won't
solve, I'm sure.

16:21.731 --> 16:22.937
(laughing)

16:23.024 --> 16:24.400
What is up with you?

16:24.484 --> 16:26.315
Up? Everything's up.

16:26.403 --> 16:28.860
Everything's up-up-upl

16:28.947 --> 16:30.278
Rygel, listen to me.

16:30.365 --> 16:33.107
Moya has a serious problem.

16:33.201 --> 16:35.283
Whatever she hit caused
some kind of...

16:35.370 --> 16:37.110
kind of fracture, I don't know.

16:37.205 --> 16:43.075
I mean, we're all here but
we're not in the same time
or place in space.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.331
( guffaws )

16:47.299 --> 16:48.288
Have you seen D'Argo?

16:48.383 --> 16:49.247
D'Argo?

16:49.342 --> 16:52.129
I don't know. Nobody's here,
not even Pilot.

16:52.220 --> 16:53.756
It was quite frantic at first.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.304
Then I realized I quite liked
being on my own.

16:56.391 --> 16:57.722
( laughs )

16:57.809 --> 16:58.844
Yeah, that's the way I usually
prefer you, too,

16:58.935 --> 17:01.972
but right now we stick
together.

17:02.063 --> 17:05.396
And then the Trawlian Priest
turns to the Calanese Cleric
and says,

17:05.483 --> 17:08.896
"Doesn't bother me. You should
have seen her mother!"

17:08.987 --> 17:12.730
(both laughing)

17:14.784 --> 17:15.910
No, no, no, no, no.

17:15.994 --> 17:17.530
His mother?

17:22.626 --> 17:25.538
Oh, oh, what am I doing?

17:25.629 --> 17:28.211
Entering into the spirit of
things, I'd say.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.043
Rygel, Rygel, look around
at this place.

17:31.134 --> 17:32.249
Do you remember what happened?

17:32.344 --> 17:33.174
Yes.

17:33.261 --> 17:35.502
Nobody liked my cholian
curd salad.

17:35.597 --> 17:38.714
( both roaring with laughter)

17:38.808 --> 17:40.469
No, no, no, no, no.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.596
Afterwards. There was
a collision.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.427
Yes. There was a collision.

17:44.522 --> 17:47.138
Yes. But we survived,
so why worry?

17:47.234 --> 17:51.648
There's..there's something
happening to Moya and to us.

17:53.281 --> 17:54.566
You don't make jokes.

17:54.658 --> 17:56.899
No. No, I don't telljokes.

17:56.993 --> 17:59.860
(both laughing)

17:59.955 --> 18:02.662
and I don't laugh at them.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.365
lt's..it's this place!
It's doing something to us.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.917
Yes, yes, it is doing
something to us.

18:08.004 --> 18:10.290
But we'll both feel better
once we've eaten.

18:10.382 --> 18:11.371
(laughing)

18:11.466 --> 18:13.548
Where there's a way in,
there's a way out.

18:13.635 --> 18:16.593
(shrill whirring noise)

18:25.855 --> 18:28.267
Hey, Guido, did you see that?

18:28.358 --> 18:31.771
Yes. I did.

18:31.861 --> 18:34.944
It was a hallucination,
Crichton. Just an
hallucination.

18:35.031 --> 18:37.647
It was real, Rygel.
It was real.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.278
I mean, we both saw it.

18:39.369 --> 18:42.782
Hmm, but it didn't come back,
and it didn't hurt us,
didn't take the food.

18:42.872 --> 18:44.408
We have to find a way
out of here.

18:44.499 --> 18:48.333
It's hard to find. You got to
listen for a weird,
strange noise.

18:48.420 --> 18:50.160
Something out of the ordinary.

18:50.255 --> 18:51.495
Hmm.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.329
Weird noise.

18:53.425 --> 18:54.665
Does my stomach count?

18:54.759 --> 18:56.545
(laughing)

18:56.636 --> 18:58.046
No, that's not funny.

18:58.138 --> 18:59.503
That is not funny, Rygel.

18:59.597 --> 19:02.054
Look, I got to get out of here
before lend up like you.

19:02.142 --> 19:04.258
What? Handsome, with a
great sexual prowess.

19:04.352 --> 19:06.263
(laughing)

19:07.063 --> 19:09.054
Shut up! Just shut up!

19:09.149 --> 19:10.480
Shh! Shh!

19:10.567 --> 19:11.807
No!

19:12.902 --> 19:14.108
I got to get out of here.

19:14.195 --> 19:16.106
Either help me, help me.

19:16.197 --> 19:17.061
Hmm.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.818
(laughing)

19:18.908 --> 19:21.285
Leave me alone!

19:21.369 --> 19:23.234
I'll be in the galley
with the food

19:23.330 --> 19:24.570
and the monster!

19:24.664 --> 19:26.746
( roars with laughter)

19:37.677 --> 19:41.420
(laughing)

19:43.308 --> 19:47.017
(squeaking, clicking noise)

19:49.689 --> 19:51.554
There's my noise.

19:59.199 --> 20:01.281
( noise intensifies )

20:04.079 --> 20:07.162
okay, Alice. Once more into
the looking glass.

20:07.248 --> 20:10.160
(giggles )

20:14.255 --> 20:16.291
(laughing)

20:16.383 --> 20:19.716
We can't find them, Pilot.
False information yet again.

20:19.803 --> 20:23.341
The DRDs still show
Officer Sun on Tier Two,

20:23.431 --> 20:25.467
Rygel outside the
Centre Chamber,

20:25.558 --> 20:27.094
D'Argo in...

20:27.185 --> 20:30.177
Competent. You got it wrong,
four arms, they're nowhere.

20:30.271 --> 20:35.391
Your inability to locate them
does not negate the fact that
they are there.

20:35.485 --> 20:36.315
Oh.

20:36.403 --> 20:38.234
Then why can't we see them?

20:38.321 --> 20:39.310
Because...

20:39.406 --> 20:41.613
Because you don't have
X-ray vision, do you?

20:41.699 --> 20:43.030
John, where have you been?

20:43.118 --> 20:44.233
Right here.

20:44.327 --> 20:46.989
Pilot, what do you know about
parallel realities?

20:47.080 --> 20:51.369
Temporal shifts. Two objects
occupying the same space
at the same time.

20:51.459 --> 20:53.620
More information, please.

20:53.711 --> 20:58.501
There are at least three other
Moyas right here, right now.

20:58.591 --> 21:02.209
Do you know the mathematical
hypothesis, Dimensional Schism?

21:02.303 --> 21:06.717
Light and sound disjointed
into base elements.

21:07.767 --> 21:10.144
Red, blue, yellow.

21:10.228 --> 21:13.470
Hypotheses don't just
materialize, Pilot.

21:13.565 --> 21:15.271
Tell us what's happened to us.

21:15.358 --> 21:20.478
Starburst is technically the
seam between space-time
dimensions.

21:20.572 --> 21:25.783
Moya's power cells allow us
access, and we simply ride out
the energy stream

21:25.869 --> 21:28.155
until we're pushed out,
at random.

21:28.246 --> 21:29.907
Chiana:
Pushed out at random?

21:29.998 --> 21:30.737
Not now, Chiana.

21:30.832 --> 21:32.447
What do you mean, not now?

21:32.542 --> 21:35.329
We go into this Starlurch thing
and we don't even know
where we're going?

21:35.420 --> 21:39.629
At the next appropriate moment,
you're welcome to leave.

21:39.716 --> 21:41.297
Oh.

21:41.384 --> 21:43.045
Tell us what happened, Pilot.

21:43.136 --> 21:47.846
In her haste to accommodate so
you wouldn't abandon us,

21:47.932 --> 21:51.675
Moya entered Starburst
without adequate thrust.

21:51.769 --> 21:55.182
At the moment,
we appear to be...

21:55.273 --> 21:58.015
stuck.

21:58.109 --> 22:01.601
Crichton:
Wild guess here, we're
still in Starburst?

22:01.696 --> 22:08.192
Regrettably, our insertion
vector was wrong and
subsequent fluctuations...

22:08.286 --> 22:11.574
Screw the science lesson, Pilot.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.781
You should have told us that
we're still in Starburst.

22:14.876 --> 22:17.618
Now we are stuck into what?

22:17.712 --> 22:20.670
Whatever's on the other side.

22:32.268 --> 22:34.475
Chiana:
You saw a creature?

22:34.562 --> 22:36.143
What kind of creature?

22:36.231 --> 22:39.143
The kind we eat or the kind
that that eats us?

22:39.234 --> 22:42.192
Is it possible that you saw a
fragment from another
dimension, John?

22:42.278 --> 22:44.394
If what Pilot says is
accurate, yeah.

22:44.489 --> 22:48.277
I've always wondered what could
be beyond height and width,
depth and time.

22:48.368 --> 22:49.733
Nausea.

22:49.827 --> 22:51.328
Spirituality.

22:51.412 --> 22:52.538
That's a good wish.

22:52.622 --> 22:55.329
Pilot says we don't have enough
power to pull free.

22:55.416 --> 22:57.281
What are we going to do?

22:57.377 --> 23:00.119
First thing, protect ourselves
in case that creature is
the "eat us" kind.

23:00.213 --> 23:02.670
You two find some weapons.
I'm going to work with Pilot.

23:02.757 --> 23:03.746
What do you have in mind?

23:03.841 --> 23:06.048
Get the others.
Bring them back.

23:07.303 --> 23:09.259
Pilot:
Follow the sequence exactly,

23:09.347 --> 23:14.057
when the ion backwash reaches
maximum, funnel it all to
reverse propulsion.

23:14.143 --> 23:15.132
I'll try.

23:15.228 --> 23:18.470
Any deviation will result
in failure.

23:18.565 --> 23:21.056
I'll still try.

23:21.150 --> 23:25.940
Look, Pilot, why is Moya being
schismed off by this deal?

23:26.030 --> 23:29.272
But not you, me, the others?

23:30.410 --> 23:31.991
Relative densities.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.740
The heavier the substance, the
more pronounced the fissure.

23:34.831 --> 23:39.416
Even now, connected to Moya
as I am, the effects are
becoming noticeable.

23:39.502 --> 23:43.211
And we are being drawn
further in by the moment.

23:43.298 --> 23:45.163
And when we get pulled apart?

23:45.258 --> 23:48.921
Molecular diaspora.

23:49.012 --> 23:54.132
You know, Pilot, Moya did not
have to go into Starburst
until she was ready.

23:54.225 --> 23:58.264
Now is hardly the time for
recriminations, Commander.

23:58.354 --> 24:00.845
It wasn't a recrimination.

24:03.067 --> 24:06.150
We should have been more
up-front about our feelings.

24:09.073 --> 24:10.904
How's she doing?

24:10.992 --> 24:15.281
Same as us, scared.

24:15.371 --> 24:18.033
Well, we'll do what we can.

24:18.124 --> 24:20.365
She knows.

24:25.340 --> 24:27.296
Crichton:
You'll be happy to know
we have a plan.

24:27.383 --> 24:28.793
I'll be happier to know
if it works.

24:28.885 --> 24:30.625
First thing, we find
the others.

24:30.720 --> 24:32.256
"We"? We're going with you?

24:32.347 --> 24:33.837
D'Argo and the others may
be injured, Chiana.

24:33.931 --> 24:34.795
Do | get a say in this?

24:34.891 --> 24:36.176
1:4,;23‘};
c e ‘24.};

24:40.938 --> 24:41.802
Look out!

24:41.898 --> 24:43.763
(shrill whirring)

25:00.291 --> 25:03.033
We stay together, the
whole way, Chiana.

25:03.127 --> 25:04.116
No roaming.

25:04.212 --> 25:05.292
Chiana:
Yes, mother.

25:05.380 --> 25:07.917
Crichton:
No, Mom, plan has changed.

25:08.007 --> 25:11.545
You stay here with Pilot.
If that creature comes
back, just...

25:11.636 --> 25:13.046
shoot it.

25:13.137 --> 25:16.300
Even I was still a full Pa'u,
lwouldn't hesitate.

25:16.391 --> 25:17.722
Right here.

25:17.809 --> 25:18.719
You ready, Pip?

25:18.810 --> 25:20.175
Uh, Pip means?

25:20.269 --> 25:21.975
My favorite traveling
companion.

25:22.063 --> 25:25.430
Before I got here, did they
believe anything you said?

25:26.150 --> 25:27.435
Aah!

25:30.113 --> 25:31.603
(moaning)

25:34.409 --> 25:36.240
I thought you said this red
light hurt your head.

25:36.327 --> 25:38.704
Huh... it does.

25:39.622 --> 25:40.782
Well, not to me.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.249
I'm so glad.

25:42.333 --> 25:44.995
Come on. Let's get...

25:45.086 --> 25:46.701
D'Argo! You're alive.

25:46.796 --> 25:48.161
D'Argo:
Barely.

25:48.256 --> 25:50.121
This light affects thinking
and motor functions.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.047
Not to me.

25:52.135 --> 25:55.753
I saw you earlier on. What the
hezmana happened to you?

25:55.847 --> 25:58.259
That's way too much to
go into right now.

25:58.349 --> 26:01.933
Suffice it to say that Moya
had a little problem
during Starburst.

26:02.019 --> 26:07.059
She's wedged herself into
another dimension and split
off into at least four distinct parts.

26:07.150 --> 26:09.357
Have you ever heard of anything
like this happening before?

26:09.444 --> 26:12.561
D'Argo, I haven't heard of
anything like anything before.

26:12.655 --> 26:16.239
My planet doesn't even go
to the Moon anymore.

26:16.325 --> 26:18.236
I've heard of it.

26:18.327 --> 26:21.319
My people's weapons
scientists once...

26:21.414 --> 26:24.372
once poked a hole through
another dimension.

26:24.459 --> 26:27.246
Once it widened, they
lost control.

26:27.336 --> 26:28.712
Yeah, and what happened?

26:28.796 --> 26:30.912
No one's sure,

26:31.007 --> 26:32.918
but a whole solar system,

26:33.009 --> 26:36.797
four populated planets,
dissolved into tiny chunks.

26:38.222 --> 26:40.258
That's why I want to
get out of here.

26:40.349 --> 26:41.725
We will.

26:43.311 --> 26:45.347
Does that thing help?

26:45.438 --> 26:49.898
Barely. | only wretch every
once in awhile now.

26:49.984 --> 26:54.102
Look, we got to get the
engines started

26:54.197 --> 26:59.317
in each of Moya's four
incarnations in order
to get out of here.

26:59.410 --> 27:01.071
Pilot isn't here to
operate them.

27:01.162 --> 27:04.620
It's all right; he told
me what to do.

27:04.707 --> 27:06.038
( screaming )

27:06.125 --> 27:07.410
(roaring)

27:11.088 --> 27:13.044
l was going to tell
you about that.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.292
Chiana:
Look!

27:16.260 --> 27:17.841
He's trying to come through
from the other side.

27:17.929 --> 27:19.260
Let's discourage it.

27:19.347 --> 27:20.678
You know how to use that thing?

27:20.765 --> 27:22.426
I'm scared grotless,
not stupid.

27:22.517 --> 27:24.257
One, two...

27:24.352 --> 27:25.137
fire!

27:25.228 --> 27:26.388
What happened to three?!

27:33.903 --> 27:35.313
We did it.

27:35.404 --> 27:38.111
It does not feel like a victory.

27:38.199 --> 27:40.611
Not at all.

27:44.789 --> 27:49.203
No, no, no, button,
then lever slide.

27:49.293 --> 27:51.124
Look, I can stay.

27:51.212 --> 27:52.918
You go get Aeryn and Rygel.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.290
You are in no condition.

27:54.382 --> 27:55.462
Well, you've been here longer.

27:55.550 --> 27:57.040
You can barely stand.

27:57.134 --> 27:59.796
Now you. You say that this
light doesn't affect you?

27:59.887 --> 28:01.093
Yeah.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.966
No. No.

28:03.057 --> 28:04.763
Yes, this light doesn't
affect me.

28:04.851 --> 28:06.307
No, lwon't stay alone.

28:06.394 --> 28:09.978
And, no, I won't stay alone.

28:10.064 --> 28:12.305
Just take the girl.
I'll be okay.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.265
Well, you know how to get out
in case something goes wrong?

28:14.360 --> 28:16.396
Yes, above the strategy table.
Now go.

28:16.487 --> 28:21.322
Alright, give us half an em,
then fire up everything
in reverse.

28:21.409 --> 28:23.695
I remember from the first seven
times that you told me.

28:23.786 --> 28:25.287
Aah! Not here! Go!

28:25.371 --> 28:26.577
Go!

28:26.664 --> 28:28.620
I do not want that here.

28:30.084 --> 28:31.369
Ooh...

28:31.460 --> 28:34.327
Chiana:
Doesn't affect me.

28:36.257 --> 28:37.121
Are you sure about this?

28:37.216 --> 28:38.877
Just go up.

28:38.968 --> 28:40.299
What if the creature's waiting?

28:40.386 --> 28:41.842
Then piss it off.

28:41.929 --> 28:42.588
How?

28:42.680 --> 28:44.216
Pretend it's me.

28:45.099 --> 28:46.635
( both grunt)

28:57.194 --> 29:00.322
(grating, high-pitched whine)

29:00.406 --> 29:04.445
( screaming )

29:23.512 --> 29:26.549
(screaming continues)

29:29.393 --> 29:32.635
( high-pitched whine continues)

30:21.195 --> 30:23.982
(roaring)

30:31.539 --> 30:34.201
( pulse pistol firing )

30:50.349 --> 30:52.965
(high-pitched humming muffled)
Hey, mu... much better.

30:53.060 --> 30:54.266
You all right?

30:54.353 --> 30:56.218
Aeryn, this is genius.

30:56.313 --> 30:59.350
I modified flight headsets to
block out acoustic wavelengths,
that's all.

30:59.442 --> 31:01.103
It's not bad for the girl who
hates to do homework.

31:01.193 --> 31:04.026
Well, it's military tech;
it's battle tested.

31:04.113 --> 31:06.695
Why did you not shoot
at that thing?

31:07.324 --> 31:08.234
I don't know.

31:08.325 --> 31:09.110
You don't... ?

31:09.201 --> 31:10.577
Brilliant instinct, Crichton.

31:10.661 --> 31:11.776
Have you seen my prowler?

31:11.871 --> 31:13.827
Oh yeah. I was here
for that show.

31:13.914 --> 31:15.199
You missed it?

31:15.291 --> 31:19.159
Look, Pilot thinks Moya's been
wedged into another dimension.

31:19.253 --> 31:20.834
That thing's trying to
get into ours.

31:20.921 --> 31:21.751
Yeah.

31:21.839 --> 31:23.249
Have you found the others?

31:23.340 --> 31:26.298
Well, Moya's separated off into
separate environments,

31:26.385 --> 31:29.172
D'Argo's in one, Rygel's
somewhere else, and we're here.

31:29.263 --> 31:31.174
Clearly, you found a route
to get through.

31:31.265 --> 31:33.927
Yeah, but it's not going to
matter if we get sucked in
any farther.

31:34.018 --> 31:34.928
Is there a plan?

31:35.019 --> 31:35.974
Yep.

31:36.062 --> 31:37.142
Well?

31:37.229 --> 31:38.560
Pilot needs more power.

31:38.647 --> 31:41.389
All the engines have to be on
full reverse at the same time.

31:41.484 --> 31:43.099
That should have been the first
thing you told me, Crichton.

31:43.194 --> 31:44.604
Yeah, no, I know. I was busy.

31:44.695 --> 31:47.277
Aeryn, wait, wait, wait.
Let me show you what to do.

31:47.364 --> 31:50.026
I know the sequence for full
reverse. Get on to the others.

31:50.117 --> 31:52.199
Pilot was pretty specific
about what he wanted.

31:52.286 --> 31:54.197
l have some of Pilot's
DNA, remember?

31:54.288 --> 31:57.246
Pilot was very specific.

31:57.333 --> 32:02.623
Rotate blue crystal, trim
yellow disk, extinguish orange
light, open copper rods,

32:02.713 --> 32:05.420
( both )
black panel depressed halfway,

32:05.508 --> 32:11.549
dial tri-connector open, hot
progression purple, green,
orange, gold lights,

32:11.639 --> 32:16.133
green knob, maximum thrust.

32:16.227 --> 32:18.934
It's going to be harder to
doubt you in the future.

32:19.021 --> 32:20.807
Well, I apologize for
my strengths.

32:20.898 --> 32:22.854
Give me half an am and
then fire it up!

32:22.942 --> 32:24.307
Got it!

32:34.537 --> 32:36.528
(moans)

32:38.040 --> 32:39.780
Chiana?!

32:40.417 --> 32:42.282
Sparky?!

32:42.378 --> 32:43.834
Sparky?!

32:54.557 --> 32:58.141
Careful, careful, don't slip
and fall and die!

32:58.227 --> 33:00.309
Aah... (laughing)

33:00.396 --> 33:02.136
I'm so glad to see you
two are safe.

33:02.231 --> 33:04.563
Well, he said you'd have that
look on your face.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.265
Well, l was worried about you.

33:06.360 --> 33:10.569
Well, I found Rygel and I
managed to bring him here.

33:10.656 --> 33:12.863
Then we started talking and...

33:13.868 --> 33:15.199
Do you know any good jokes?

33:15.286 --> 33:17.026
Not besides the one I'm living.

33:17.121 --> 33:21.080
Oh, all right, Mr. Serious,
what're you doing?

33:21.167 --> 33:24.500
Putting Moya's propulsion
system into full reverse.

33:24.587 --> 33:26.418
Hmm? Oh! Reverse?

33:26.505 --> 33:30.714
Hah! No Dominar from the House
of Rygel ever travels
in reverse.

33:30.801 --> 33:33.668
Well, turn around and pretend
you're going forward.

33:33.762 --> 33:35.718
(Chiana and Rygel laughing)

33:35.806 --> 33:37.262
You stay here with Napoleon.

33:37.349 --> 33:41.092
If for any reason the engines
shut down, restore the
green knob.

33:41.187 --> 33:42.176
Ignore the green slob.

33:42.271 --> 33:44.011
(Chiana chuckling)

33:44.106 --> 33:47.849
Restore the green knob.

33:47.943 --> 33:50.935
You do that, I'll let you take
3 Transport down to the next
planet, okay?

33:51.030 --> 33:52.110
Crichton, that's outrageous.

33:52.198 --> 33:55.235
Green knob. Green knob.

33:55.326 --> 33:57.191
Good girl.

33:57.286 --> 33:58.901
Hang tough, Sparky.

33:58.996 --> 34:00.532
Enjoy the personality.

34:00.623 --> 34:02.909
(both laughing)

34:03.000 --> 34:06.993
Oh, there is no expanse of the
mind the will cannot traverse,

34:07.087 --> 34:10.170
or physically the distance laid
across the universe.

34:10.257 --> 34:14.296
There's blessings many in the
stars save one lamented curse,

34:14.386 --> 34:18.675
that Sixteenth Rygel, glory me,
must travel in reverse!

34:18.766 --> 34:20.882
( both laughing hysterically)

34:20.976 --> 34:25.265
There's a little dance that
goes with that, but I can't do
them both at the same time.

34:25.356 --> 34:27.438
(laughing)

34:33.739 --> 34:34.979
(laughing)

34:35.074 --> 34:36.484
Aah!

34:36.575 --> 34:39.032
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:39.119 --> 34:41.201
I wish people would stop
pointing guns at me.

34:41.288 --> 34:45.952
When you didn't show, I was
beginning to think I was in the
wrong place.

34:46.043 --> 34:48.250
Pilot reports full reverse
power. You did it, John.

34:48.337 --> 34:49.622
What about the creature?

34:49.713 --> 34:51.544
Well, I keep shooting at it but
it keeps coming back.

34:51.632 --> 34:54.624
Well, we've got to hold it off
until Pilot can get us
out of here.

34:54.718 --> 34:56.458
Your vestments?

34:56.553 --> 34:59.511
I suddenly realised I had
forsaken priesthood in practise
but not in my soul.

34:59.598 --> 35:00.713
Why did you put them on now?

35:00.808 --> 35:05.177
I... I fear we may
die here soon.

35:07.773 --> 35:10.139
Whole sections of the ship
are being swallowed up.

35:10.234 --> 35:12.316
Pilot, it's getting worse.

35:12.403 --> 35:13.643
Crichton.

35:18.033 --> 35:19.534
Pilot, report.

35:19.618 --> 35:24.908
Not good. Despite Moya's best
efforts we're still
being drawn in.

35:24.999 --> 35:27.615
There is one very long shot.

35:27.710 --> 35:29.166
Anything, Pilot.

35:29.253 --> 35:33.246
Moya could willingly,
lose the baby.

35:33.340 --> 35:34.455
-No.
-No way.

35:34.550 --> 35:37.337
It will definitely increase
her power quotient

35:37.428 --> 35:40.215
though lam not sure if it is
enough to get us free.

35:40.306 --> 35:43.423
Pilot, no. We cannot ask Moya
to make that sacrifice.

35:43.517 --> 35:46.759
We should not have attempted
Starburst when we did.

35:46.854 --> 35:50.187
Our insecurities have brought
us to this place.

35:50.274 --> 35:54.768
Besides, the baby cannot
survive if we don't.

35:54.862 --> 35:56.944
Pilot, listen to me.

35:57.031 --> 36:00.819
Whatever happens,
we go together.

36:00.909 --> 36:02.445
We keep the baby.

36:04.371 --> 36:06.327
(roaring)
John!

36:10.044 --> 36:13.582
Shoot it! Moya is very scared.
Please shoot it!

36:14.214 --> 36:15.829
Don't fire.

36:16.800 --> 36:18.336
It's coming through.

36:18.427 --> 36:20.509
John, the hole's widening.

36:28.687 --> 36:31.144
Prime numbers.

36:32.566 --> 36:36.275
These scratches are grouped
in prime numbers.

36:36.362 --> 36:39.104
Three, five,

36:39.198 --> 36:40.358
seven, eleven,

36:40.449 --> 36:41.780
prime!

36:41.867 --> 36:43.107
It's trying to communicate.

36:43.202 --> 36:45.158
You bet your blue ass.

36:45.245 --> 36:47.236
This isn't an attack, Zhaan.

36:48.374 --> 36:50.365
It's an invitation.

36:55.381 --> 36:58.168
I urge you to shoot it!

36:58.926 --> 37:01.588
It's trying to communicate.

37:01.678 --> 37:03.805
I know it.

37:04.473 --> 37:06.134
It's not attacking.

37:07.643 --> 37:10.851
John, no! What if the
hole closes up?

37:10.938 --> 37:13.520
Then I'll be dead a few
minutes before you.

37:17.194 --> 37:19.276
That's all.

37:47.766 --> 37:50.974
( echoing ):
Who are you?

37:51.061 --> 37:52.642
Female voice:
Unimportant.

37:52.729 --> 37:55.471
Your container has breached
our existence.

37:55.566 --> 37:57.397
Is that where I am?

37:57.484 --> 38:00.066
In your dimension?

38:00.154 --> 38:02.861
There can be no overlap.

38:02.948 --> 38:06.111
This is the expanse between.

38:06.201 --> 38:11.537
Your mental organ is unable to
interpret the chasm to
your existence.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.124
(laughing)

38:13.208 --> 38:15.039
You got that right, pal.

38:15.127 --> 38:18.836
My function is to
repair breaches.

38:18.922 --> 38:21.504
Does this happen a lot?

38:21.592 --> 38:24.755
Never before with
living material.

38:24.845 --> 38:27.211
Bad news, pal. We are living.

38:28.390 --> 38:30.221
Can you help us get out?

38:30.309 --> 38:33.517
I must destroy all material.

38:33.604 --> 38:35.185
The breach is fatal.

38:35.272 --> 38:39.140
Whoa, whoa, hang on, give us
a chance. We're..we're trying
to back out.

38:39.234 --> 38:43.273
That path will tear the rupture
beyond restoration.

38:43.363 --> 38:45.149
So what are you saying?
There's no way?

38:45.240 --> 38:47.231
Forward.

38:47.326 --> 38:49.567
Forward?

38:49.661 --> 38:53.279
I thought you said we can't
exist in your existence.

38:53.373 --> 38:57.992
I will attempt to conduct you
back to the space you began.

38:58.086 --> 38:59.872
Starburst.

38:59.963 --> 39:01.464
I can guide.

39:01.548 --> 39:06.258
You must provide your own
thrust, forward.

39:06.345 --> 39:09.178
Wait, wait, wait! What if we
don't have enough power?

39:09.264 --> 39:11.926
Forward.

39:12.017 --> 39:13.382
Wait!

39:18.273 --> 39:20.309
Did you hear it?
Did you hear it?

39:20.400 --> 39:23.437
Zhaan:
Hear what? You barely got your
head inside the hole and out again before it closed.

39:23.529 --> 39:25.190
The creature, I talked to it.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.657
Commander, there wasn't time.

39:27.741 --> 39:29.277
There was for me.

39:29.368 --> 39:31.233
You got to tell Moya to
stop resisting.

39:31.328 --> 39:34.536
She has to go forward.
Starburst forward.

39:34.623 --> 39:36.454
I will not.

39:36.542 --> 39:39.909
We don't have a choice.
Look, you tell me what to do and
I'll relay it to the others.

39:41.338 --> 39:43.374
Pilot, trust me.

39:44.883 --> 39:46.874
Reverse the final four controls.

39:46.969 --> 39:50.302
Right. Give me 500 microts,
then go.

39:50.389 --> 39:51.378
John.

39:51.473 --> 39:52.838
John, what if you're wrong?

39:52.933 --> 39:55.800
Oh, you were going to
pray anyway.

40:08.365 --> 40:10.151

40:29.678 --> 40:31.634
D'Argo:
The engines are in full
reverse. Did it work?

40:31.722 --> 40:34.885
(retching)
Aw... Oh...

40:34.975 --> 40:36.385
Shut it down.

40:36.476 --> 40:38.967
Wrong direction.
We have to go forward.

40:39.062 --> 40:40.142
No, that is suicide.

40:40.230 --> 40:42.391
Uh-uh, no, no, no, it's the
same control sequence.

40:42.482 --> 40:45.315
Just reverse the last
four commands.

40:45.402 --> 40:46.938
Look, can you explain to me how
you arrived at this decision?

40:47.029 --> 40:51.147
No. No, no time.
Just wait 300 microts,
then forward.

40:51.241 --> 40:54.074
l have no time-keeping device.

40:54.161 --> 41:01.374

one-mississippi-three, 300, forward.

41:40.374 --> 41:41.614
Aeryn, you there?

41:41.708 --> 41:43.369
Ah, where have you been?

41:43.460 --> 41:45.951
On the run.
Where are you?

41:46.046 --> 41:48.753
I'm trying to get out of here.
I didn't know if you were
coming back.

41:48.840 --> 41:51.456
I'd never leave you.

41:51.551 --> 41:52.927
Something the matter?

41:53.011 --> 41:54.967
Yeah. We got it wrong.

41:55.055 --> 41:56.716
We have to go forward.

41:56.807 --> 41:58.343
Just tell me what I have to do.

41:58.433 --> 42:00.344
150 microts from now,

42:00.435 --> 42:04.303
full maximum thrust.
You know how to do that?

42:04.398 --> 42:06.138
Yes, of course I do.

42:06.233 --> 42:09.316
Good. Hey look, this dimension
thing's chopping up
the whole ship.

42:09.403 --> 42:10.643
You know a way I can
get to quarters?

42:10.737 --> 42:14.321
Well, the lower levels
are gone.

42:14.408 --> 42:17.866
You might want to try Tier
Seven through the Ion
Backwash Chamber.

42:17.953 --> 42:19.113
I'm going to head back
to Pilot's.

42:19.204 --> 42:20.740
150 microts.

42:20.831 --> 42:22.162
130 now, good luck.

42:22.249 --> 42:24.581
Back at you, baby.

43:03.123 --> 43:04.363
(loud whining whir)

43:12.841 --> 43:14.126
fifty-two. ..

43:14.217 --> 43:16.299
fifty-one. ..

43:16.386 --> 43:17.922
fifty...

43:26.980 --> 43:28.140
(Rygel laughing)

43:28.231 --> 43:30.347
Rygel:
Oh, there you are!

43:30.442 --> 43:34.060
The other runners came
through here arns ago!

43:34.154 --> 43:36.145
Still auditioning for
Star Search, I see.

43:36.239 --> 43:38.946
No. l have a new
philosophy, Crichton.

43:39.034 --> 43:40.695
What used to be important isn't

43:40.786 --> 43:43.949
and what should be important,
never will be.

43:44.039 --> 43:46.906
Great, that way when this whole
thing screws up and we die,

43:47.000 --> 43:48.581
you're not going to be whinging
in my ear, right?

43:48.668 --> 43:49.953
(laughing)

43:50.045 --> 43:51.125
12...11...

43:51.213 --> 43:55.331
Hey, why don't you relax?
Join in the fun?

43:55.425 --> 43:58.292
Give me seven seconds, baby.
We'll come or go together.

43:58.386 --> 43:59.592
Four...

43:59.679 --> 44:00.668
three...

44:00.764 --> 44:02.220
two...

44:02.307 --> 44:03.467
one...

44:03.558 --> 44:04.843
(laughing)

44:04.935 --> 44:06.425
(deep rumbling)

44:06.520 --> 44:07.851
Whoa...

44:07.938 --> 44:09.678
Oh hell, we're screwed.

44:09.773 --> 44:11.013
(laughing)

44:11.107 --> 44:13.234
(grunts)

44:13.318 --> 44:15.229
Should I disrobe so
it's memorable?

44:15.320 --> 44:16.526
Yes.

44:16.613 --> 44:19.400
(rumbling intensifying)

44:23.411 --> 44:24.662
(yelling and grunting)

44:31.670 --> 44:33.376
(grunting)

44:51.690 --> 44:56.229
(laughing)

44:56.319 --> 44:58.776
(gasps )
I'm alive!

44:58.864 --> 45:00.980
(laughing)

45:01.074 --> 45:06.194
(all laughing)

45:06.288 --> 45:08.745
(sighs)

45:14.838 --> 45:19.207
I fail to see the source
of your amusement.

45:19.301 --> 45:24.591
(laughing continuing)

45:32.272 --> 45:33.762
(all laughing)

45:33.857 --> 45:35.939
Crichton:
No, no, no, you did
not say that.

45:36.026 --> 45:37.186
ldid.

45:37.277 --> 45:39.142
I was very shameless
in my youth.

45:39.237 --> 45:40.101
And that worked?

45:40.196 --> 45:41.447
Of course not.

45:41.531 --> 45:44.523
The girl screamed and
I was almost arrested.

45:44.618 --> 45:47.951
And when they didn't give it
back, we beat the gris
out of them.

45:48.038 --> 45:49.244
(Zhaan laughing)

45:49.331 --> 45:50.662
Should I be telling you this?

45:50.749 --> 45:53.286
Zhaan:
My dear I've kicked more ass
than you've sat on.

45:53.376 --> 45:55.116
(laughing)

45:55.211 --> 45:58.795
Oh, yes, I spent all evening
listening to them gripe
and whine about me,

45:58.882 --> 46:02.090
but of course, they didn't
realize I was their Dominar.

46:02.177 --> 46:04.213
I admire your openness to
criticism, Rygel.

46:04.304 --> 46:05.919
When did you tell them
who you were?

46:06.014 --> 46:07.754
At their trial, of course.

46:07.849 --> 46:10.261
(laughing)

46:10.352 --> 46:14.436
Everyone, is itjust me, or is
this the best food that
we have ever had?

46:14.522 --> 46:17.389
Mmm, nothing like the taste of
death to clear the palate, huh?

46:17.484 --> 46:21.477
I suppose there isn't a thing
here that I couldn't live on
for a cycle.

46:21.571 --> 46:23.812
Except... except maybe this.

46:23.907 --> 46:28.742
Now I was assuming that because
of the lack of taste in that,

46:28.828 --> 46:30.989
that it was a garnish.

46:31.081 --> 46:34.915
Hey, hey, hey, those are
Grandmother Crichton's famous
buttermilk biscuits.

46:35.001 --> 46:36.457
Rygel:
What's in them?

46:36.544 --> 46:43.086
Self-raising flour, ah, salt,
shortening, buttermilk,
touch of honey.

46:43.176 --> 46:46.293
But we have none of those
ingredients, John.

46:46.388 --> 46:48.344
Yeah, maybe that's the problem.

46:48.431 --> 46:50.513
(laughing)

46:54.396 --> 46:56.182
Pilot:
I'm sorry to interrupt
your meal,

46:56.272 --> 47:00.185
but how can you all be so
jovial after our near-miss?

47:00.276 --> 47:03.063
We were affected profoundly
by it, Pilot.

47:03.154 --> 47:04.690
How are you two handling it?

47:04.781 --> 47:09.366
Well enough to alleviate
your concerns about our
Starburst problems.

47:09.452 --> 47:13.661
There's been a change in the
status of Moya's baby.

47:17.752 --> 47:19.253
Is she in any danger?

47:19.337 --> 47:21.168
Doing fine.

47:21.256 --> 47:24.043
Actually, more than fine.

47:25.635 --> 47:27.171
We're going to have a baby?

47:27.262 --> 47:28.377
Yes.

47:28.471 --> 47:31.929
There's no exact timetable for
Leviathan gestations,

47:32.017 --> 47:35.305
but Moya feels confident
the day is coming.

47:35.395 --> 47:36.726
Oh-ho!

47:36.813 --> 47:39.930
Well, in that case, tell her
if she's so inclined,

47:40.025 --> 47:42.141
when it is born she can
name it after me.

47:42.235 --> 47:43.816
That would only work if
it was a runt.

47:43.903 --> 47:45.313
Watch it, girly!

47:45.405 --> 47:47.361
Crichton:
This is one of the good
days, people.

47:47.449 --> 47:50.111
To a healthy, happy baby!

47:50.201 --> 47:51.190
Rygel:
Hear, hear!

47:51.286 --> 47:52.275
Thanks.

47:52.370 --> 47:55.077
(others laughing )

47:57.834 --> 47:59.165
Rygel...

47:59.252 --> 48:01.618
No, no, no! Ew!

48:01.713 --> 48:03.419
( spitting )
