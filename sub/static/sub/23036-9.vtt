00:32.531 --> 00:34.100
Beast, I'm not afraid of you.

00:47.881 --> 00:48.915
No limits. Go for it.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.255
I want to win for myself.

03:31.110 --> 03:33.813
As a full-time job, professionally,

03:33.880 --> 03:38.451
I am a kindergarten teacher.

03:39.118 --> 03:42.021
But I also work as a model on the side.

03:42.422 --> 03:47.126
Last summer, I was offered a job
in a club further south.

03:47.527 --> 03:51.264
They wanted me to work as a PR guy,

03:51.564 --> 03:52.966
but with no shirt.

03:53.366 --> 03:56.035
Many of the parents
that go to that beach club

03:56.102 --> 03:58.071
already knew me from the school,

03:58.171 --> 04:02.108
so seeing their children's teacher there
with no shirt on wasn't ideal.

04:02.175 --> 04:04.510
So I saw the mask, and said, "That's it.

04:04.577 --> 04:07.880
If you let me wear the mask
and create a character, I'll do it."

04:08.314 --> 04:09.849
Here comes "Mike the Zebra."

04:33.873 --> 04:36.709
-Go, buddy!
-Yeah!

04:41.447 --> 04:44.183
Let's watch this... from the rear!

04:44.450 --> 04:45.518
There it is...

04:51.391 --> 04:52.492
...very fit.

04:52.558 --> 04:54.594
Perfect! Yes, sir!

04:54.661 --> 04:57.230
Come on, Jorge! You can do it!

04:57.297 --> 05:00.166
-Come on! Come on!
-That's the spirit of the Beast!

05:00.233 --> 05:02.535
-Is he going for the extra points?
-Jump!

05:02.602 --> 05:03.670
-Great!
-Great!

05:10.109 --> 05:14.280
From now on, we're going to call him
"Saint George." Saint George!

05:14.714 --> 05:16.949
-Go, Jorge! Go! Go!
-I'm owning it!

05:24.057 --> 05:25.058
Let's go!

05:30.296 --> 05:31.864
-Yes!
-Come on!

05:32.365 --> 05:34.167
I'm already excited.

05:38.104 --> 05:39.272
You've got this!

05:39.706 --> 05:42.175
I own this beast!

06:00.460 --> 06:01.661
It's so hot!

06:23.249 --> 06:25.718
He's already spinning,
but he can still make it.

06:25.785 --> 06:28.421
Let's be hopeful.
Let's send him some good vibes.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.958
No!

06:36.729 --> 06:41.467
-It was so close! It was this close!
-No! Come on!

06:41.534 --> 06:43.403
What a shame! What a shame!

06:50.209 --> 06:52.712
The trapeze got out of control.

06:52.779 --> 06:56.082
I should have controlled it better,
maybe taken more time with it,

06:56.149 --> 06:57.884
and gathered more momentum.

06:57.950 --> 06:59.685
I'll do it much better next time.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.343
-Biligetu!
-Clear the level!

07:24.410 --> 07:25.445
YOU CAN DO IT, CHINA

07:35.021 --> 07:38.925
He's Mongolian.
Let's do a Mongolian dance.

07:39.225 --> 07:42.395
â™ª I can hear the footsteps of the horses â™ª

07:53.539 --> 07:56.175
While my co-host was dancing,

07:56.242 --> 07:59.078
Biligetu went past the Grinder.

08:00.680 --> 08:04.417
Okay, now he's slowly moving
down the Faceplant.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.653
You can do it! Goodness, I'm so tired.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.301
-It's because you're not dancing.
-I'll dance.

08:22.368 --> 08:23.269
-Oh, gosh!
-Okay.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.605
This is so tiring. Please thank me later.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.342
He fell.

08:29.742 --> 08:30.576
He fell.

08:32.979 --> 08:35.414
That's too bad. That's too bad.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.638
-I'm Mehdi.
-I'm Nabil.

08:58.704 --> 08:59.739
The Hadim brothers.

09:02.808 --> 09:06.979
We're quite well-known in our city
and within the parkour community.

09:08.447 --> 09:09.949
We're twins

09:10.016 --> 09:14.453
and we have very different personalities.

09:15.054 --> 09:18.357
Mehdi's the strong one.

09:18.424 --> 09:19.692
And I'm the wise one.

09:20.493 --> 09:25.331
I think that if we were one person,
that person would be pretty great.

09:26.098 --> 09:27.633
We're strongest together,

09:27.700 --> 09:31.470
and I think that's really
going to make a difference mentally.

09:39.011 --> 09:40.012
He is promising.

09:40.079 --> 09:44.650
Let's remember that the French
do parkour because they invented it.

09:44.717 --> 09:47.153
The Italians have invented
everything else.

09:47.219 --> 09:48.888
The French - only parkour.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.225
Go, Mehdi! This is easy for you!

09:54.727 --> 09:59.498
He's an economics student.
His family says he's the brains.

09:59.565 --> 10:03.135
-He's the brains of the family.
-Good brain, good body.

10:03.202 --> 10:05.071
-As he is showing us now!
-There you go!

10:05.137 --> 10:06.806
Well done, Mehdi! Let's go!

10:42.141 --> 10:45.111
Come on. He's smiling! Well done!

10:51.651 --> 10:54.153
-Bravo!
-Well done!

10:54.954 --> 10:58.658
-Come on. Pressure, pressure...
-Go, Mehdi. You can do it.

11:34.860 --> 11:37.530
We've never seen that technique before!

11:37.596 --> 11:40.666
He decided to cling to the ropes
using his legs.

11:40.733 --> 11:42.935
It worked! It worked for Mehdi!

12:04.190 --> 12:07.660
-Let's go, let's go!
-We're off to a good start this evening!

12:07.727 --> 12:08.561
It's started.

12:17.636 --> 12:20.272
-Perfect! Wonderful!
-The French guy did great.

12:20.339 --> 12:23.309
-He did everything successfully.
-Well done, French guy!

12:23.375 --> 12:26.412
Congratulations to the French.
Congratulations to Mehdi.

12:26.912 --> 12:30.015
I can feel your heart beating
at 200,000 kilometers an hour!

12:30.082 --> 12:31.784
I'm fine, and I'm very pleased.

12:31.851 --> 12:36.222
I'm pleased with the French team
and our results each night.

12:36.288 --> 12:38.124
Thanks for the love - from my brother,

12:38.190 --> 12:41.994
my friends and family here
and the whole French team - it's amazing.

12:42.061 --> 12:45.331
Incredible. He's still shaking.
Well done, Mehdi! We're so proud.

12:45.397 --> 12:46.632
Oh, look at that!

14:13.219 --> 14:14.453
Take your time!

14:25.831 --> 14:28.100
-110 and 120 points!
-Go, France!

14:28.667 --> 14:30.236
Well done to both brothers.

14:45.117 --> 14:46.418
I like him

14:46.485 --> 14:48.187
because he always smiles.

14:48.254 --> 14:50.489
I like people who always smile.

15:10.342 --> 15:14.079
-Bianca has a question for you.
-Who do you want to dedicate this to?

15:14.146 --> 15:15.614
To my mom.

15:16.081 --> 15:19.151
-Hi, Mom!
-Hello to his mom!

15:20.786 --> 15:22.454
You were great!

18:58.403 --> 19:00.439
It's a pleasure to see such athletes.

19:00.506 --> 19:04.176
This competition is too exhilarating.

19:10.349 --> 19:11.183
Well done.

19:51.757 --> 19:54.126
I am a resident of Fatehabad, Haryana.

19:54.459 --> 19:56.995
Most families in Haryana are conservative.

19:58.430 --> 20:01.400
In a bodybuilding competition,
one needs to wear a bikini.

20:01.767 --> 20:04.102
A Haryana girl, in a two-piece,
on stage...

20:04.336 --> 20:07.172
My father
wouldn't even let me wear capri pants.

20:07.239 --> 20:09.841
Now, his daughter
is wearing a bikini, on stage...

20:10.342 --> 20:13.946
After, I said, "I want to do just this.
I want to quit my job."

20:14.746 --> 20:17.182
I don't think
there is a bigger shock than that.

20:17.716 --> 20:21.320
For me,
my life is about realizing my dream.

20:39.204 --> 20:41.873
What a grab, buddy.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.636
Wow! She's got 25 points.

21:10.702 --> 21:13.038
And what a great performance
Shweta has given.

21:32.624 --> 21:35.227
She's looking down,
which she should not be doing.

21:48.807 --> 21:51.943
The important part is...
Oh, she's here with the veggies.

21:53.045 --> 21:54.079
What's going on?

22:28.914 --> 22:31.283
Come on, Alberto!

23:03.715 --> 23:04.816
What a pity.

23:16.928 --> 23:19.297
-Great, Alberto!
-Great, Alberto!

23:19.364 --> 23:20.599
Great, Alberto!

23:20.665 --> 23:23.769
Great, Alberto! You are great!

23:24.936 --> 23:27.372
-Oh, that was a great jump!
-He's great!

23:27.439 --> 23:29.941
It's nice to watch Alberto
in the Indian booth.

23:30.008 --> 23:32.277
But they didn't eat the pasta.

24:02.607 --> 24:06.311
Two Italians have made it
to the next level.

24:06.378 --> 24:08.380
I am really happy,

24:08.447 --> 24:11.249
because Alessio is a really good guy,

24:11.316 --> 24:14.653
and I can't wait to do
the second stage with him.

24:14.719 --> 24:19.124
Unfortunately,
France is once again kicking our butt.

25:08.640 --> 25:12.277
Life hasn't always been easy for us.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.012
When we were very little,

25:14.079 --> 25:18.049
for various reasons,
we lived with a foster family.

25:18.116 --> 25:21.653
It was really...
It wasn't a particularly nice experience.

25:22.387 --> 25:25.056
For three years,
we didn't really see our parents.

25:25.123 --> 25:27.459
My mother did everything to get us back.

25:27.526 --> 25:28.827
And she did.

25:28.894 --> 25:32.931
Two years later, our dad died,

25:32.998 --> 25:38.336
so sadly, our relationship with him

25:38.403 --> 25:39.538
didn't last very long.

25:42.807 --> 25:48.780
I think my father would be very proud
of what my brother and I have become,

25:48.847 --> 25:49.915
and of what we do.

25:49.981 --> 25:54.686
The fact that we're representing
France right now is unbelievable.

25:56.087 --> 25:58.456
-Let's go, Nabil!
-Come on, Nabil.

26:01.159 --> 26:02.193
Perfect!

26:02.594 --> 26:03.995
The French hat...

26:04.062 --> 26:04.996
Oh, Francesco!

26:05.063 --> 26:07.465
If our Italian athletes could see you...

26:07.766 --> 26:09.901
you would hurt their feelings.

26:09.968 --> 26:12.137
I am French!

26:12.203 --> 26:14.039
I would throw it on the ground.

26:22.380 --> 26:23.815
Easy!

26:31.756 --> 26:33.725
-Bravo!
-You're doing well.

26:34.159 --> 26:36.328
Don't forget to breathe, Nabil. Breathe!

27:30.015 --> 27:32.417
-He's giving us his model pose.
-I love it. Look.

27:33.952 --> 27:36.521
Let's do voodoo to the French hat!

27:36.588 --> 27:40.158
Do voodoo to the French hat! Come on!

28:03.314 --> 28:05.884
-Yes!
-Have a break. Have a KitKat, kids!

28:05.950 --> 28:08.620
-So cool, so cool.
-I love it.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.088
He laid down.

28:11.489 --> 28:13.491
-Because the French...
-Bummer!

28:13.558 --> 28:15.894
...must always overdo it.

28:19.898 --> 28:23.334
Now Nabil will fall.
He will fall, fall, fall!

28:23.401 --> 28:27.439
I think you should take the hat off,
because it's only bringing them luck.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.388
-Oh, no...
-Oh, Nabil!

28:43.455 --> 28:45.256
Well done!

28:45.323 --> 28:47.559
The French guy fell!

28:47.625 --> 28:48.727
Hurrah!

28:48.793 --> 28:51.129
The French guy has fallen!

28:52.697 --> 28:55.500
It was... hard at the end.

28:56.334 --> 29:00.438
I was out of breath
and my hands were too...

31:49.641 --> 31:54.379
We're with you, buddy!
Mehdi! Mehdi! Mehdi!

31:58.816 --> 32:03.288
If Mehdi makes it through,
I'll give him my watch.

32:03.354 --> 32:07.892
-Why not? Come on.
-I'd be careful, Gilles...

32:08.559 --> 32:11.562
That's a nice image!
The French are all sticking together.

32:11.629 --> 32:14.832
It'll be even nicer when he falls.
They will all suffer together.

32:24.375 --> 32:26.110
Let's go, Mehdi!

32:26.778 --> 32:28.980
He's reached the Digestive Track.

32:29.380 --> 32:30.648
Hey, Italy!

32:30.982 --> 32:33.851
Oh, come on! Go away!

32:43.861 --> 32:45.029
Go!

33:11.556 --> 33:15.226
Come on. He must not fall here.
He has to get to the other side.

34:12.250 --> 34:14.752
If he keeps this up,
I'm going to lose my watch,

34:14.819 --> 34:15.920
but never mind.

34:29.867 --> 34:33.571
-You're not in this alone. You can do it.
-You can do it.

34:34.005 --> 34:36.841
I think we should get ready
to go get him.

34:36.908 --> 34:38.775
We should all go get him.

35:19.417 --> 35:21.519
There we go, the champion's watch!

35:22.854 --> 35:23.988
Well done!

35:44.642 --> 35:47.078
-From India...
-And his nickname is Popeye.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.913
And you can hear them chant,

35:49.447 --> 35:52.450
according to Beastmaster,
Popeye's the best!

35:52.517 --> 35:53.718
He's a very fit man.

36:04.962 --> 36:06.597
Oh no, buddy. Don't let go...

36:43.467 --> 36:45.403
Francesco is making a turban

36:45.469 --> 36:47.138
with the Italian flag.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.273
Let's hope it brings good luck.

36:49.807 --> 36:50.975
Here I am!

36:51.375 --> 36:54.145
Now it's getting serious! No kidding!

37:02.587 --> 37:03.721
Come on!

37:11.028 --> 37:12.029
Oh, no!

37:41.959 --> 37:44.028
My sport is rock climbing.

37:44.095 --> 37:47.098
I have a very aggressive approach
to rock climbing,

37:47.164 --> 37:51.335
because the less time
I spend on the wall and the holds,

37:51.402 --> 37:52.970
the higher I can reach.

37:53.037 --> 37:55.239
When I'm not training,

37:55.306 --> 37:57.908
I study mechatronic engineering.

37:58.542 --> 38:01.078
There are similarities
between rock climbing

38:01.145 --> 38:02.680
and mechatronics,

38:02.747 --> 38:07.818
because in the latter you try
to find solutions to practical problems,

38:07.885 --> 38:11.889
in order to reach your goal
in as little time as possible.

38:12.423 --> 38:15.893
My approach to the Beast
will definitely be quick and aggressive,

38:15.960 --> 38:19.130
just as it is in rock climbing
and anything else I do.

38:24.935 --> 38:28.773
Let's hope
our Alberto sends Colt home!

38:28.839 --> 38:30.741
Come on, Alberto!

38:30.808 --> 38:34.078
You need 200 points!

38:34.145 --> 38:36.747
200 points!

38:36.814 --> 38:39.350
Bianca Balti has gone completely nuts.

38:39.417 --> 38:40.418
Are we ready?

39:23.127 --> 39:25.363
Go, go, go!

39:25.429 --> 39:26.964
Go, Alberto!

39:27.031 --> 39:30.134
Come on! Our rock climber! Quick, quick!

39:30.201 --> 39:32.269
-Go, go, go!
-This is exciting!

39:33.104 --> 39:35.039
Yes! Go, Alberto!

39:42.847 --> 39:45.216
Brilliant!

39:45.282 --> 39:48.352
He sent the American guy home!

39:48.719 --> 39:53.290
Go home! Colt is going home!

40:20.384 --> 40:22.253
Great, Alberto!

40:22.319 --> 40:24.455
Bianca Balti has gone mad.

40:24.522 --> 40:26.157
I have lost my mind.

40:26.223 --> 40:28.659
She started off very quiet.

40:28.726 --> 40:32.196
-And now she's worse than me.
-Make our dreams come true!

40:33.497 --> 40:36.033
-No, no! This is enough!
-A little voodoo...

40:36.100 --> 40:37.835
This is enough!

40:49.046 --> 40:50.114
Great!

40:50.181 --> 40:51.415
Let's hug!

40:51.482 --> 40:53.150
This is so cool!

40:53.217 --> 40:55.152
We are great!

41:00.424 --> 41:03.594
Spain! Spain!

41:09.366 --> 41:10.835
Go, Spain!

41:12.937 --> 41:13.838
Come on!

41:13.904 --> 41:16.207
-He's already up there.
-He's awesome!

41:31.455 --> 41:34.992
Spain, united, will never be defeated!

42:48.732 --> 42:49.833
Way to go, genius!

42:50.401 --> 42:51.936
He made it!

44:06.276 --> 44:11.281
I'm 50 points ahead, so if I stay
on track, everything should be fine.

44:12.683 --> 44:14.251
But it is a very difficult level,

44:14.318 --> 44:16.487
so I'm going to have
to really concentrate.

44:18.956 --> 44:20.624
-Go, Mehdi!
-Go.

44:52.823 --> 44:55.559
Things are happening very fast
for Mehdi.

44:55.626 --> 44:57.995
-One of the best stories of this season.
-Yes.

44:58.062 --> 45:00.197
These two brothers support each other.

45:00.264 --> 45:02.599
They've been doing parkour
for eight years.

45:36.066 --> 45:39.036
Mehdi's beginning to tire...

45:39.103 --> 45:40.671
Come on, big guy.

45:55.753 --> 45:58.088
-Don't let go!
-Don't let go!

45:58.155 --> 45:59.757
Nabil, I can't do it.

46:06.697 --> 46:09.433
-He's fallen in the water.
-It's all over.

46:09.500 --> 46:12.503
Mehdi had so many points.

46:22.212 --> 46:24.815
At the end, he was really supportive.

46:25.382 --> 46:28.719
It was really hard.
I told him I was sorry.

46:41.632 --> 46:43.700
A warning to the other contestants -

46:43.767 --> 46:45.169
I'm going to own this level.

46:45.235 --> 46:47.871
I will thrash you.

47:00.984 --> 47:04.121
-Yes! He got the Point Thruster!
-He got it!

47:18.569 --> 47:20.637
We're at the Coil Crawl now.

47:20.704 --> 47:23.874
I think it was Mehdi who showed him
that technique. Obviously.

47:23.941 --> 47:27.878
Look, everything the French do
works really well for the Italians.

47:30.714 --> 47:33.517
-He's super fast and super agile.
-Quick, quick!

47:33.584 --> 47:34.952
He is great!

47:35.018 --> 47:38.856
-And he is Italian!
-Go, go! Fast!

47:58.876 --> 48:01.245
He grabbed the bar!

48:01.311 --> 48:05.682
-Unbelievable! Alberto is great!
-We've got to break their bones!

48:05.749 --> 48:07.417
No...

48:07.484 --> 48:09.219
No, no, no. Go, go!

48:09.286 --> 48:11.121
Come on, Alberto. Go!

48:38.715 --> 48:40.617
This is called Figure Four.

48:40.684 --> 48:46.256
The athlete rests: he rests his biceps
and stresses the abs for a while.

48:46.323 --> 48:50.027
The abs are much stronger,
and he needs to rest the biceps,

48:50.093 --> 48:53.163
because when the biceps are dead,
the game is over.

49:38.909 --> 49:41.912
He's got another Point Thruster!

49:41.979 --> 49:43.880
Great, Alberto!

49:43.947 --> 49:45.615
Way to go!

49:53.190 --> 49:56.727
-You're a rock climber.
-Come on, Alberto!

49:56.793 --> 50:00.330
-Show the French what you can do!
-You're good.

50:03.667 --> 50:04.768
No!

50:04.835 --> 50:07.204
Honestly, he couldn't do more than this.

50:07.270 --> 50:09.139
Great, Alberto!

50:09.206 --> 50:11.341
-Congratulations, Alberto!
-Yes!

50:11.675 --> 50:13.076
I won a lot of points.

50:13.143 --> 50:17.414
I hope it's enough
to move on to the next stage.

50:17.481 --> 50:18.615
Great, Alberto!

50:54.217 --> 50:56.753
-Excellent! Well done!
-Good! He nailed that one!

51:20.310 --> 51:23.747
This guy has already stolen the hearts
of all the Spanish girls.

51:23.814 --> 51:26.483
And, most likely,
the hearts of all the Spanish guys.

51:42.299 --> 51:44.367
-Yes, good!
-Don't waste any time, Jorge!

51:44.734 --> 51:47.003
-Keep going! Come on!
-Up you go! Come on!

52:47.764 --> 52:50.901
He missed the Point Thruster!
That's 10 points he missed!

52:50.967 --> 52:53.103
-Come on, Alessio!
-Don't stop.

53:27.804 --> 53:29.472
Get it, get it!

53:50.961 --> 53:53.964
He's advancing,
but he should go a little faster.

53:54.030 --> 53:56.266
Come on, Alessio!

54:17.487 --> 54:19.055
Oh, no!

54:21.558 --> 54:23.860
I was about to get out of the Beast,

54:23.927 --> 54:26.930
but unfortunately
I began to drown in the water.

54:26.997 --> 54:30.100
But it's okay. I'm happy for Alberto.

54:42.345 --> 54:43.913
I don't want to watch!

54:43.980 --> 54:47.651
Cover your eyes! It's like
the World Cup final: Italy versus France.

54:47.717 --> 54:50.920
I want another double final,
another French final.

54:50.987 --> 54:51.988
Go, Nabil!

55:03.466 --> 55:05.635
Let me get my magic wand!

55:05.702 --> 55:08.438
-Yes, to...
-To jinx him!

55:35.265 --> 55:36.266
Go! Go!

55:47.077 --> 55:49.079
Go, Nabil! He can do it.

55:49.145 --> 55:52.115
-I really want us in the final!
-A France versus France final.

55:52.182 --> 55:53.149
That would be great.

55:54.217 --> 55:56.986
-Look, he's about to fall!
-It's working!

56:13.903 --> 56:15.171
Don't give up!

56:15.238 --> 56:17.040
-Go!
-Come on, come on...

56:23.346 --> 56:25.682
-Fall!
-Fall, fall, fall!

56:25.749 --> 56:27.951
-You will fall!
-Fall, fall, fall!

56:28.017 --> 56:30.520
-Jump, jump...
-Now!

56:30.587 --> 56:31.621
Jump!

56:38.328 --> 56:42.799
I don't believe it. That's such a shame.

56:54.377 --> 56:55.912
What a shame.

56:56.913 --> 56:59.382
I'm sad not to be
in the final with my brother,

56:59.449 --> 57:01.017
but that's how the game goes.

57:01.084 --> 57:02.719
-Italy!
-France!

57:02.786 --> 57:04.254
-Italy!
-France!

57:04.320 --> 57:08.024
Your bones!
The final is Italy versus France!

57:08.091 --> 57:09.325
Italy versus France!

58:14.424 --> 58:16.292
We have two great athletes!

58:16.359 --> 58:19.662
I brought an onion to repel bad luck!

58:19.729 --> 58:21.664
I have a red pepper!

58:40.950 --> 58:44.053
-At the moment, they're...
-They're basically neck and neck.

58:44.120 --> 58:46.489
-Alberto's caught up.
-Go, Mehdi!

58:56.533 --> 58:59.235
Alberto got the Point Thruster!

58:59.302 --> 59:02.205
He's great!

59:06.309 --> 59:10.046
The Italians are loud,
but we're even louder!

59:10.113 --> 59:12.282
-Go, Mehdi!
-Come on, the blues!

59:47.951 --> 59:49.986
-Go, France!
-Go!

59:55.792 --> 59:58.328
He got another Point Thruster!

59:58.394 --> 01:00:00.129
Great, Alberto!

01:00:17.981 --> 01:00:19.716
Hey, take your time!

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:20.883
Come on, Alberto!

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:25.622
Unbelievable! The onion power!

01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:03.026
Come on, Mehdi. We believe in you!

01:01:03.092 --> 01:01:04.227
Come on! Let's go.

01:01:04.293 --> 01:01:05.294
Go, France!

01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:09.565
No! Come on! Go, go!

01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:15.872
It's the end of the Beast. Let's go!

01:01:21.911 --> 01:01:25.248
Alberto! Alberto!

01:01:25.314 --> 01:01:27.684
I'm going crazy!

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:30.353
The onion brought us good luck!

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:05.354
Great, Alberto!

01:02:05.421 --> 01:02:06.889
Very good, Alberto!

01:02:06.956 --> 01:02:08.191
Very good!

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:12.228
Look at that. The Italians are happy
that they've knocked us out.

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:38.221
It was a tough fight until the end.

01:02:38.421 --> 01:02:43.126
I knew I needed as many points as
possible, including the Point Thrusters.

01:02:43.192 --> 01:02:47.396
He was breathing down my neck all along.
It was really hard to beat him.
