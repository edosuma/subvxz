WOMAN [over P.A.]:
Welcome to Toronto Pearson
International Airport.

00:06.040 --> 00:09.521
Please have your passport
and customs form ready.

00:11.700 --> 00:13.008
DELLINGER:
Hey,

00:13.050 --> 00:14.039
it's me.

00:14.100 --> 00:15.488
HOPKINS:
Hey, It IS you.

00:15.530 --> 00:16.519
Where are you?

00:16.580 --> 00:17.797
I-I-I just got in.

00:17.840 --> 00:19.922
I-I need some reassurance here.

00:19.970 --> 00:22.188
I already told you, you're fine.

00:22.230 --> 00:23.185
As of when?

00:23.240 --> 00:25.276
As of last week.

00:25.320 --> 00:27.754
They're all ISIS-obsessed now.

00:27.810 --> 00:29.619
You're old news, buddy.

00:29.680 --> 00:31.545
When's the funeral?

00:33.810 --> 00:35.766
Jeff.

00:35.810 --> 00:36.936
Yeah, what?

00:36.990 --> 00:39.333
When is your mom's funeral?

00:39.380 --> 00:41.029
Oh, tomorrow. Look...

00:41.080 --> 00:42.069
I'm-I'm heading towards Customs.

00:42.120 --> 00:43.337
You're sure?

00:43.390 --> 00:45.255
Am I sure you're
off the BOLO list?

00:45.300 --> 00:47.029
Yeah, as of last year.

00:47.090 --> 00:48.694
DELLINGER:
When did you check it last?

00:48.740 --> 00:50.958
HOPKINS:
Two weeks ago.

00:51.000 --> 00:51.955
Hey.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.342
Ow.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.879
You know, you can just say,
"Hey, Jonathan."

00:54.920 --> 00:57.480
This guy... I think he
sounds like Dellinger.

00:57.530 --> 00:59.043
Our Dellinger?

00:59.100 --> 01:00.522
He's in Iceland.

01:00.580 --> 01:02.309
I'm, uh, scanning
Tyler's calls

01:02.360 --> 01:03.611
and then this guy
comes on the line.

01:03.670 --> 01:04.705
DELLINGER:
What about last week?

01:04.760 --> 01:07.149
HOPKINS:
I don't work there anymore.

01:07.190 --> 01:08.623
DELLINGER:
What? Tyler, I only

01:08.670 --> 01:10.535
came here because
you said I was old news.

01:10.590 --> 01:12.455
What's the number?It's a burner.

01:12.500 --> 01:13.979
Tell the systems admin.

01:14.030 --> 01:15.895
[groans]
I just sent
you something.

01:15.940 --> 01:16.895
What?

01:16.940 --> 01:18.896
No more goats.

01:18.940 --> 01:20.020
We're done with goats.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.468
It's a monkey
riding a goat.

01:21.510 --> 01:22.818
I don't care if it's
a goat making a pizza.

01:22.860 --> 01:25.033
This is Station 549,
I need the system admin.

01:26.990 --> 01:30.642
WOMAN [over P.A.]:
Welcome to Toronto Pearson
International Airport.

01:30.690 --> 01:31.645
Please have your

01:31.700 --> 01:33.952
passport and customs form ready.

01:43.660 --> 01:44.445
MAN:
Next in line, please.

01:46.450 --> 01:49.499
Welcome to Toronto

Please have your passport

01:51.320 --> 01:53.459
and customs form ready.

01:57.420 --> 01:59.024
Passport, please.

02:01.810 --> 02:04.119
Sir, passport.

02:04.160 --> 02:05.559
[man speaking French over P.A.]

02:05.600 --> 02:07.113
I, uh... it's okay,
wr-wrong line.

02:09.300 --> 02:12.167
Sir, sir,
you need to come with us.

02:12.210 --> 02:13.347
Hey, no, I'm-I'm not
going to America, um...

02:13.390 --> 02:14.778
I was in the wrong line.

02:14.830 --> 02:15.774
Excuse me, what's
the problem here?

02:15.830 --> 02:16.865
No, I'm not going to America.

02:16.910 --> 02:18.081
I'm staying in Canada.All right,

02:18.130 --> 02:19.609
gentlemen, please,
I need you to back away.

02:19.660 --> 02:21.139
I'm sorry, I'm a Peel
Regional police officer

02:21.180 --> 02:22.784
and I need to ascertain
what this is all about.

02:22.830 --> 02:24.878
And I'm a US. Customs
and Border Protection officer,

02:24.920 --> 02:26.831
and he's in US. Preclearance
and under our jurisdiction.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.131
Well, no, actually,
that's not true.

02:28.190 --> 02:30.795
You're on Canadian soil,
you see, so until...

02:30.840 --> 02:33.365
That's easily fixed.Well, I never gave him
my passport!

02:33.410 --> 02:35.014
I never gave him my passport.No, no, we're not doing...

02:35.060 --> 02:36.402
the middle of
the preclearance process.

02:36.460 --> 02:38.712
Relax.I want my lavwer!

02:38.760 --> 02:40.409
[officers arguing]I want to call my lawyer!

02:43.980 --> 02:45.982
Why would I ever get out of bed?

02:47.030 --> 02:48.588
Life?

02:55.870 --> 02:58.953
Your phone has
been ringing.

02:59.000 --> 02:59.989
I'm throwing it away.

03:00.040 --> 03:02.952
[chuckles]

03:06.360 --> 03:07.873
What?

03:07.920 --> 03:10.445
I need to tell you something.

03:11.970 --> 03:13.528
You killed a man in Reno.

03:13.580 --> 03:14.615
Yeah...

03:14.670 --> 03:15.887
[clucks tongue]

03:15.930 --> 03:17.056
Lucca told you?

03:17.100 --> 03:18.533
Hey, we all make mistakes.

03:23.330 --> 03:26.936
So... I don't want
you to get worried

03:26.980 --> 03:29.892
about this because it has
nothing to do with you.

03:29.940 --> 03:30.895
What doesn't?

03:30.940 --> 03:31.895
This thing...

03:31.950 --> 03:33.247
that I'm going to tell you.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.904
I was gonna do it anyway.

03:34.950 --> 03:37.339
Okay.

03:37.390 --> 03:39.335
So, that's a bad preamble.

03:39.390 --> 03:41.255
I should have just said it.

03:41.300 --> 03:43.734
Now you're all braced.

03:43.780 --> 03:44.735
Here...

03:44.780 --> 03:45.860
unbrace yourself.

03:45.920 --> 03:48.480
Okay.

03:48.530 --> 03:50.430
You know, we'll talk later,
this was stupid.

03:50.490 --> 03:52.003
No, no, no.

03:52.050 --> 03:53.961
What, Alicia?

04:01.060 --> 04:02.846
I'm getting divorced.

04:05.410 --> 04:08.026
Okay, I shouldn't have
said anything because

04:08.070 --> 04:10.026
it has nothing to do with you.

04:10.070 --> 04:15.019
I just didn't want you to hear
about it and think that I was...

04:15.080 --> 04:17.423
you know...

04:17.470 --> 04:20.462
No, I don't know.

04:20.520 --> 04:21.817
[sighs]

04:21.870 --> 04:23.030
...expecting
something from this.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.123
Makes sense.

04:30.870 --> 04:33.486
Okay.

04:33.530 --> 04:34.690
Ijust...

04:34.750 --> 04:37.446
[phone rings]

04:39.100 --> 04:41.000
That's your phone.

04:41.060 --> 04:43.142
Don't go anywhere, okay?

04:48.890 --> 04:51.017
Alicia Florrick.

04:51.070 --> 04:52.719
What?

04:52.770 --> 04:54.021
Jeff?

04:54.070 --> 04:55.856
Where are you?

04:55.900 --> 04:57.117
Okay.

04:57.160 --> 04:58.377
Okay!

04:58.420 --> 05:00.502
I'm on my way.

05:00.560 --> 05:03.381
No, no... hold on, hold on,
this is my call-waiting.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.943
Alicia Florrick.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.730
Eli... your name didn't come up.

05:10.780 --> 05:13.476
I know, I borrowed an intern's
phone so you wouldn't ignore me.

05:13.530 --> 05:15.134
[whispering]:
Peter is being arrested.

05:15.180 --> 05:16.397
What?

05:16.440 --> 05:17.998
I'm in negotiations
with the US. attorney.

05:18.050 --> 05:19.039
I need you to explain to him

05:19.100 --> 05:20.522
why Peter can't be
arraigned today.

05:20.580 --> 05:21.524
Anything will do.

05:21.580 --> 05:23.400
Are you serious?Yes!

05:23.450 --> 05:24.530
The grand jury
delivered a true bill.

05:24.580 --> 05:25.922
It just happened.

05:25.970 --> 05:27.016
How long will it
take you to get here?

05:27.060 --> 05:28.368
Well, I can't today.

05:28.410 --> 05:30.105
I have to go to Toronto.

05:30.150 --> 05:31.936
You what?!

05:31.980 --> 05:33.413
Why?!

05:33.460 --> 05:35.234
I have a client up there.

05:38.030 --> 05:39.759
I promised him.

05:39.810 --> 05:42.074
[whispering]:
Not today.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.156
Okay, it looks like we can
hold this off until tomorrow.

05:44.210 --> 05:45.552
When do you get back?

05:45.600 --> 05:46.555
Tonight.

05:46.600 --> 05:47.908
Okay, good.

05:51.650 --> 05:53.163
He is the governor
of the state.

05:53.220 --> 05:54.869
He is the corrupt governor
of a state who arranged

05:54.910 --> 05:57.174
a mistrial in trade
for campaign donations.

05:57.220 --> 05:58.949
Allegedly.

05:59.010 --> 06:02.650
May I remind you
this appearance negotiation

06:02.710 --> 06:04.871
is a courtesy my office
extends to certain

06:04.920 --> 06:06.091
high profile defendants,

06:06.140 --> 06:07.744
and I can end it at any time.The governor

06:07.800 --> 06:11.361
is being briefed
on homeland security tomorrow...

06:11.410 --> 06:14.322
unless you want to be seen
as endangering that.

06:14.370 --> 06:15.496
Noon tomorrow:-
that's the best I can give you.

06:15.540 --> 06:16.495
At your office,

06:16.550 --> 06:18.359
not the apartment.
Fine.

06:18.420 --> 06:19.364
With no handcuffs.

06:19.420 --> 06:20.500
Handcuffs are not optional.

06:20.550 --> 06:21.767
Not behind his back,
do it in front

06:21.810 --> 06:23.243
where he can put
a jacket over it.

06:23.290 --> 06:24.370
I am executing
an arrest warrant,

06:24.420 --> 06:25.944
not stage managing a TV event.

06:25.990 --> 06:27.287
And we...

06:27.340 --> 06:28.295
are trying to maintain

06:28.340 --> 06:29.944
the dignity of this office,

06:29.990 --> 06:32.379
so the governor does not
look like Khalid Mohammed

06:32.430 --> 06:34.990
being dragged out of
his apartment in a T-shirt.

06:36.040 --> 06:38.304
Okay.

06:38.350 --> 06:39.510
Agreed.

06:39.570 --> 06:40.559
LUCCA:
I don't like Canada.

06:40.610 --> 06:42.396
It's too clean.

06:42.440 --> 06:45.432
I always want
to litter here.

06:45.490 --> 06:47.299
Where do we go?

06:47.360 --> 06:48.349
Alicia?

06:48.400 --> 06:49.355
What?

06:49.400 --> 06:50.446
Where do we go?

06:50.490 --> 06:51.445
Are you okay?

06:51.490 --> 06:53.048
Yeah, um, they said

06:53.100 --> 06:55.239
the Peel Regional
Police office.

06:56.410 --> 06:57.365
Do you still
talk to Jason?

06:57.410 --> 06:58.581
Do I?

06:58.630 --> 06:59.710
Yeah.

06:59.760 --> 07:00.749
He's good, right?

07:00.810 --> 07:01.845
He's fine with things?

07:01.890 --> 07:03.198
Yeah, he likes work,

07:03.240 --> 07:05.117
he likes the
con5istent money...

07:05.160 --> 07:06.855
or is that what
you're asking?

07:06.900 --> 07:09.596
Yeah... yeah.

07:09.640 --> 07:11.551
LUCCA:
Cute hats.

07:11.600 --> 07:14.467
This is an airport
and not an embassy.

07:14.520 --> 07:15.646
You're on Canadian soil.

07:15.690 --> 07:17.476
Alicia, over here.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.250
MAN:
He crossed the line
into Preclearance.

07:20.300 --> 07:21.642
OFFICER:
Which is not an
international border.

07:21.700 --> 07:24.396
The United States
holds jurisdiction

07:24.440 --> 07:25.828
over its
preclearance area.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.484
Jeff, how are you?

07:27.530 --> 07:28.485
Well, that
depends.

07:28.530 --> 07:30.839
There seems to be some question

07:30.880 --> 07:32.609
about where my feet stood.

07:32.660 --> 07:33.831
Hi.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.666
Lucca Quinn.Jeff Dellinger,

07:35.710 --> 07:37.837
a C-list Edward Snowden.

07:37.890 --> 07:39.107
Shh!

07:39.150 --> 07:41.493
Let's not joke about that,
please.

07:41.540 --> 07:43.326
Gentlemen, hello.

07:43.370 --> 07:44.325
I'm Alicia Florrick,

07:44.370 --> 07:45.712
this is Lucca Quinn.

07:45.760 --> 07:47.102
We're representing
Mr. Dellinger's interests.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.502
There are no interests.

07:48.550 --> 07:50.154
This is purely
a jurisdictional issue.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.509
Then you have no interest
in Mr. Dellinger?

07:52.550 --> 07:54.279
Purely an interest
in your jurisdiction?

07:54.340 --> 07:58.117
Mr. Dellinger is
an American citizen.

07:58.170 --> 07:59.683
He has been traveling abroad.

07:59.740 --> 08:01.298
He had purchased a ticket

08:01.350 --> 08:02.601
to Phoenix, Arizona...

08:02.650 --> 08:03.901
My mom's funeral.

08:03.960 --> 08:05.916
...and we have a_ few
questions for him.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.439
That is all.
Wou_ld these
questions have

08:07.480 --> 08:09.175
anything to do
with his recent work

08:09.220 --> 08:10.562
as a National Security
Agency contractor?

08:10.620 --> 08:11.609
This is purely

08:11.660 --> 08:13.218
about which country holds sway

08:13.270 --> 08:16.524
over a preclearance area
in an international airport.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.536
Diane, hi.

08:18.580 --> 08:20.184
No, Toronto.

08:20.230 --> 08:22.312
Um, I have a quick question.

08:22.370 --> 08:25.237
Who knows the most
about international law?

08:25.280 --> 08:26.588
Unfortunately, that was Cary.

08:26.630 --> 08:28.621
Why?

08:28.680 --> 08:31.148
Oh, okay, well...

08:31.200 --> 08:33.634
let me see if I can find anyone.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.591
Hey, um, what about Jason?

08:35.640 --> 08:36.982
Uh, he helped me on a case once.

08:37.030 --> 08:39.464
Did you know he used
to be a lawyer?

08:39.510 --> 08:41.205
Yes, I did know that.

08:41.250 --> 08:43.161
Do you want me
to have him call you?

08:43.210 --> 08:45.258
No, no, that's okay, I'll call.

08:45.300 --> 08:46.346
I'll talk to you.

08:47.170 --> 08:49.126
Let me guess...

08:49.180 --> 08:50.169
you have to go?

08:50.220 --> 08:52.211
No, not yet.

08:53.310 --> 08:55.175
Not yet means...

08:55.230 --> 08:56.128
20 minutes.

08:58.010 --> 08:59.261
We can do a lot in 20 minutes.

08:59.320 --> 09:00.389
You're dressed.

09:04.630 --> 09:06.928
It's never
stopped us before.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.710
Let's talk.

09:15.770 --> 09:16.725
Uh-oh.

09:16.770 --> 09:17.759
What?

09:19.820 --> 09:21.685
No, I was just--
I-I've never heard

09:21.730 --> 09:22.947
you use those words before.

09:22.990 --> 09:24.207
What's wrong?

09:24.250 --> 09:25.558
All I said was,
"Let's talk."

09:25.600 --> 09:27.773
Sit down, this is hard for me.

09:27.820 --> 09:30.288
Oh, my God, what?

09:30.350 --> 09:31.385
Would you wait?

09:31.440 --> 09:33.658
Why is everything suddenly bad?

09:33.700 --> 09:36.919
We've been married now
for three years and

09:36.960 --> 09:39.918
I've seen you, maybe,
98 days over that time.

09:39.970 --> 09:41.358
Well, you're at trials.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.095
I mean, I'm... I run a law firm.

09:43.140 --> 09:44.220
That's just who we are.

09:44.270 --> 09:46.352
Diane, I'm selling my business.

09:46.410 --> 09:48.184
I want to move in together...

09:48.230 --> 09:49.401
full-time.

09:51.760 --> 09:53.011
You bastard.

09:53.070 --> 09:54.799
You had me so worried.

09:54.850 --> 09:56.408
I thought you wanted a divorce!

09:56.460 --> 09:57.586
I don't.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.323
Well, did you tell your face?

09:59.380 --> 10:01.109
[laughing]:
You can't use

10:01.160 --> 10:02.946
the same expression
for everything.

10:02.990 --> 10:04.810
So, do you not
want me to move in?

10:04.860 --> 10:06.464
[laughs]

10:09.470 --> 10:12.030
[moans]

10:12.080 --> 10:13.035
Ow.

10:13.090 --> 10:14.955
[grunts]
Yeah...

10:15.000 --> 10:17.434
yeah, I think
our teeth hit.
[laughing]

10:17.480 --> 10:19.914
Okay.

10:19.960 --> 10:21.268
Okay.

10:21.310 --> 10:22.356
Look, this is what I need,

10:22.400 --> 10:23.298
if you're up for this, too.

10:23.360 --> 10:25.442
I have a buyer
for my business

10:25.490 --> 10:27.663
and I need you to
review the contracts.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.530
So this is happening?

10:29.580 --> 10:31.400
I have an offer.

10:31.450 --> 10:33.054
Will you review
the contracts?

10:33.110 --> 10:35.055
Oh...

10:35.110 --> 10:36.759
[phone ringing]

10:36.810 --> 10:40.496
[cell phone buzzing]

10:45.290 --> 10:47.815
[line ringing]

10:51.470 --> 10:53.028
Hey, so you there?

10:53.080 --> 10:55.207
Yes, Canada.

10:55.260 --> 10:56.989
Very clean, I hear.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.086
Um, I'll be back tonight.

10:58.130 --> 10:59.210
I have a quick question.

10:59.260 --> 11:00.386
Shoot

11:00.440 --> 11:02.954
Can US. Customs
and Border Protection

11:03.010 --> 11:05.262
_ detain an_Ame_rican
in a Canadian airport?

11:05.310 --> 11:07.130
No...

11:07.180 --> 11:09.876
wait, with one exception.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.659
How do you know that?

11:11.710 --> 11:14.144
Well, I brought mushrooms
back from Winnipeg once,

11:14.190 --> 11:15.270
so I checked.

11:15.320 --> 11:17.311
Well, that's very revealing.

11:17.370 --> 11:22.364
Um... I have someone in the US
Preclearance and Customs area--

11:22.420 --> 11:24.672
one foot in, one foot out.

11:24.720 --> 11:25.937
This is a matter of...

11:25.980 --> 11:27.288
Hey, what do you got?

11:27.330 --> 11:29.503
Alicia Florrick talking
trial strategy.

11:29.550 --> 11:30.505
On what?

11:30.550 --> 11:31.721
On Dellinger.

11:31.770 --> 11:33.169
JASON:
Even if you're just using

11:33.210 --> 11:34.723
Toronto as a hub,

11:34.780 --> 11:36.680
you pass through US. Customs
in Canada, not the US

11:36.730 --> 11:38.334
Who's that?

11:38.390 --> 11:39.607
JONATHAN:
The investigator
she's sleeping with.

11:39.650 --> 11:41.129
Shut up, J.

11:41.170 --> 11:42.865
It's the investigator
from her firm...

11:42.910 --> 11:43.865
the one she's...

11:43.920 --> 11:45.217
sleeping with.

11:45.260 --> 11:46.522
Now, the only way
a preclearance officer

11:46.570 --> 11:48.344
can detain you is if you make

11:48.400 --> 11:50.527
a false or deceptive
statement to them.

11:50.570 --> 11:51.525
All right.

11:51.580 --> 11:52.877
Send me the recording.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.319
Don't you think you
want me on this, too?

11:54.360 --> 11:55.918
[chuckles]

11:55.970 --> 11:56.925
Sorry, J.

11:56.970 --> 11:58.619
How are your
tax accountants?

11:58.670 --> 12:00.922
I'll call you later, okay?

12:00.980 --> 12:02.459
We're free to go.

12:02.500 --> 12:03.580
They're bringing in a justice

12:03.630 --> 12:04.585
tomorrow to decide.

12:04.630 --> 12:05.801
Seriously?

12:05.850 --> 12:06.805
They're keeping
Dellinger overnight.

12:06.850 --> 12:07.976
I'll stay.

12:08.030 --> 12:09.065
You go home.

12:09.110 --> 12:10.668
Okay, thanks.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.504
My husband, he's...

12:12.550 --> 12:14.541
having issues.

12:16.560 --> 12:19.859
So, you'll turn yourself
in tomorrow at noon.

12:19.910 --> 12:21.127
Alicia will
come With you.

12:21.170 --> 12:22.478
They will process you

12:22.520 --> 12:23.862
and release you
on a signature bond.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.901
I've set a press
conference for 2:00.

12:25.960 --> 12:27.564
There'll be no media
with the AUSA,

12:27.610 --> 12:28.656
so we'll get
the first word.

12:28.700 --> 12:31.692
And that word is
"witch hunt."

12:31.750 --> 12:33.308
That's two words.

12:33.360 --> 12:36.090
I know, I was just going
with what Eli was...

12:36.140 --> 12:37.220
Alicia.

12:37.270 --> 12:38.259
Good, good.

12:38.320 --> 12:40.538
Come in.

12:40.580 --> 12:41.478
To my house?

12:41.540 --> 12:43.019
Yes, I'm sorry.

12:43.060 --> 12:44.846
Um, there were cameras outside

12:44.890 --> 12:47.404
the governor's residence.

12:47.460 --> 12:48.677
How was Toronto?

12:48.720 --> 12:50.449
Complicated but clean.

12:50.500 --> 12:51.489
How are you?

12:51.550 --> 12:53.711
Anxious.

12:53.770 --> 12:55.374
Anyone?

12:55.420 --> 12:57.069
Uh, yes, that would be good.

12:59.600 --> 13:00.726
So what do you need from me?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.031
MICHAE_L:
We were just
discussing strategy.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.331
What do you think of the

13:03.390 --> 13:05.255
kids joining you
at a press conference?

13:05.300 --> 13:06.255
Sure...

13:06.300 --> 13:07.551
when?

13:07.610 --> 13:08.770
You don't mind the kids

13:08.830 --> 13:10.252
being in front
of the cameras?
No.

13:10.310 --> 13:11.789
Should I?
It's just,

13:11.830 --> 13:14.264
you've always
minded before...

13:14.310 --> 13:15.652
whenever I've asked.

13:15.700 --> 13:17.748
Things have changed.
Their dad's in trouble.

13:17.790 --> 13:20.577
I'd rather they
didn't do that.

13:20.620 --> 13:21.928
Zach's in college.

13:21.970 --> 13:24.052
Grace is gonna be there soon.

13:24.100 --> 13:25.533
I want them to focus on that.

13:25.580 --> 13:28.231
Okay, we'll work with it,

13:28.280 --> 13:29.838
and we want you there

13:29.890 --> 13:31.016
walking with Peter
for the perp walk.

13:31.070 --> 13:32.674
[doorbell rings]

13:35.240 --> 13:36.502
Is Grace home?

13:36.550 --> 13:38.063
PETER:
No, she's at Jackie's.

13:45.690 --> 13:46.850
Mrs. Florrick,
I have a warrant here

13:46.910 --> 13:48.207
for the arrest
of Peter Florrick.

13:48.260 --> 13:49.511
ELI:
He screwed us.

13:49.560 --> 13:50.549
He wants to

13:50.610 --> 13:51.599
embarrass you by dragging

13:51.650 --> 13:52.992
you out in your shirt sleeves.

13:54.650 --> 13:55.867
He's got TV cameras, too.

13:55.920 --> 13:56.864
Mr. Florrick,

13:56.920 --> 13:58.399
you're under arrest.

13:58.440 --> 14:00.658
Governor Florrick,
you son of a bitch.

14:00.700 --> 14:02.395
You were just delaying so
you could coordinate strategy.

14:02.450 --> 14:04.315
There was no homeland
security meeting.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.408
Please cuff the governor.

14:06.450 --> 14:08.964
OFFICER:
Please take your hands
out of your pockets.

14:09.020 --> 14:11.363
Put your hands
where I can see them.

14:11.410 --> 14:12.536
Are you on any
prescription medication?

14:12.590 --> 14:14.103
OFFICER 2:
Mrs. Florrick, please step back.

14:14.150 --> 14:15.879
You have the right
to remain silent.
Do you have

14:15.940 --> 14:16.975
any health concerns
we should know about?

14:17.030 --> 14:18.418
Anything you say or do can

14:18.460 --> 14:19.449
and will be used
against you in a...

14:35.040 --> 14:37.565
No, Mrs. Florrick,
this is not a photo op.

14:37.610 --> 14:40.477
You will not embarrass
my husband.

14:45.840 --> 14:46.909
[whispering]:
Thank you.

14:46.970 --> 14:49.609
Hey... we'll handle this.

14:49.670 --> 14:51.570
All right, thank you,
that's enough, let's go.

14:55.980 --> 14:58.448
[reporters clamoring]

15:11.470 --> 15:12.425
NEWSCASTER: Governor Florrick
was arrested last night

15:12.470 --> 15:13.550
on charges of bribery...

15:13.600 --> 15:14.999
Not as bad as it
could have been.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.814
We need to ask
for a speedy trial.

15:16.870 --> 15:18.167
We need to find out
what they have.

15:18.220 --> 15:19.608
I'm hiring an investigator.Good.

15:19.650 --> 15:21.049
Someone independent.

15:21.090 --> 15:22.569
It can't be anyone from here.Don't worry.

15:22.610 --> 15:24.259
I have someone in mind.

15:24.310 --> 15:26.619
MAN [over P.A.]:
Boarding call for Flight 121...

15:27.700 --> 15:30.089
WOMAN:
Good morning, all.

15:30.140 --> 15:33.610
I'm the justice of
the peace, Nora Valentine.

15:33.670 --> 15:35.274
Welcome.

15:35.320 --> 15:37.663
The issue, as I understand it,

15:37.710 --> 15:41.009
is about the Preclearance Act
of 2001.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.196
ATTORNEY:
Yes, Your Honor.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.673
Mr. Dellinger
crossed the line

15:43.720 --> 15:45.972
into US. Preclearance
where we detained him

15:46.030 --> 15:47.713
because of a statement
that he made...But they only

15:47.770 --> 15:49.374
detained him after he crossed
back across the line.

15:49.420 --> 15:51.024
He did not cross completely
back across the line...

15:51.080 --> 15:52.854
He did cross completely
back across the line.

15:52.900 --> 15:54.333
...which is why
we detained him...
VALENTINE:
Thank you...

15:54.380 --> 15:56.940
and you all are Americans,
is that right?

15:56.990 --> 15:58.810
Well, let's leave

15:58.870 --> 16:01.338
the land of guns and gangs
behind us, shall we,

16:01.390 --> 16:02.470
and not interrupt
each other.

16:02.520 --> 16:04.511
Also, as I am a

16:04.570 --> 16:07.130
justice of the peace
and not a judge,

16:07.180 --> 16:09.171
you should refer to me
as Your Worship

16:09.220 --> 16:10.300
and not Your Honor.

16:10.360 --> 16:11.748
Now, I know that

16:11.790 --> 16:13.963
may sound foreign
to American ears,

16:14.010 --> 16:15.705
but that's the way
we do it here.

16:15.750 --> 16:18.401
Now, then... my understanding...

16:18.450 --> 16:20.532
WOMAN [over P.A.]: Do not leave
your luggage unattended.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.229
Unattended luggage will
be confiscated or destroyed.

16:22.280 --> 16:23.326
Is there any way

16:23.370 --> 16:24.325
to turn that off?
OFﬂCER:

16:24.370 --> 16:26.418
no, uh,
unfortunately not.

16:28.500 --> 16:30.377
I didn't think
you were coming.

16:30.420 --> 16:31.409
Thanks for doing this.

16:31.460 --> 16:32.415
No problem.

16:32.460 --> 16:33.415
Your Honor...

16:33.470 --> 16:34.721
[whispering]:
Worship.

16:34.770 --> 16:35.759
Worship?

16:37.210 --> 16:39.770
Your... Worship,

16:39.820 --> 16:41.776
according to the
Preclearance Act

16:41.820 --> 16:43.640
of 2001, the country
of destination

16:43.690 --> 16:45.555
can detain a passenger

16:45.610 --> 16:48.784
if that passenger has,
in some way, lied

16:48.830 --> 16:50.604
to the preclearance
officer,

16:50.660 --> 16:52.434
and our client
did not lie.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.129
Is that right, Mr....?

16:54.180 --> 16:55.738
Gerald Gallo,
Your Worship.

16:55.790 --> 16:57.041
It is not.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.967
IfI may,
the preclearance officer,

17:00.010 --> 17:01.056
Ms. Ordonez.

17:01.100 --> 17:02.624
I asked Mr. Dellinger

17:02.670 --> 17:04.535
if he ever committed a crime...

17:04.580 --> 17:05.490
and he said no.

17:05.540 --> 17:06.928
She's lying.
That's a lie.

17:06.980 --> 17:08.060
Sir...There was no exchange...

17:08.110 --> 17:09.361
...we will refrain

17:09.410 --> 17:11.059
from American-style
interruptions.

17:11.110 --> 17:12.281
GALLO:
Given that Mr. Dellinger

17:12.330 --> 17:13.979
lied, the United States

17:14.030 --> 17:15.543
is within its rights
to detain him.

17:15.590 --> 17:17.546
May we have a moment,
Your Hon--

17:17.600 --> 17:20.558
Worship, uh, to...

17:20.600 --> 17:21.555
gather a piece
of evidence?

17:21.600 --> 17:22.589
You may.

17:23.730 --> 17:24.719
No,dont.

17:24.780 --> 17:26.509
Why?

17:26.560 --> 17:28.289
Are we under surveillance?

17:28.350 --> 17:29.908
DELLINGER:
I wouldn't take that chance.

17:31.570 --> 17:33.219
Uh-oh.

17:35.700 --> 17:37.133
What?

17:37.180 --> 17:39.262
They're avoiding phones.

17:39.310 --> 17:41.619
Dellinger knows
we're here.

17:41.660 --> 17:44.094
I know that--
that's why I said, "Uh-oh."

17:44.150 --> 17:46.095
N EWSCASTER: ...released
on his own recognizance.

17:46.150 --> 17:48.539
Okay, I looked into it.

17:48.580 --> 17:49.797
Yeah, I saw.

17:49.850 --> 17:51.010
...with his wife
Alicia Florrick at his side.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.493
Is this good publicity or bad?

17:53.550 --> 17:55.359
We should call
the clients.

17:55.420 --> 17:56.717
My guess is,
they won't care

17:56.770 --> 17:58.249
u_nless Peter
Florrick goes down.

18:00.290 --> 18:02.155
Okay, so what
did you find?

18:02.210 --> 18:04.678
That your husband
shouldn't sell his business,

18:04.730 --> 18:06.595
at least not to PGT Ballistics.

18:06.650 --> 18:08.811
They're offering
60% of its value.

18:08.870 --> 18:10.428
What did you find?

18:10.480 --> 18:11.606
The same.

18:11.650 --> 18:13.163
So, why is he
selling his company

18:13.220 --> 18:14.824
for so little?He may not know,

18:14.870 --> 18:16.599
or he may just want out fast.

18:16.660 --> 18:19.128
Why out fast?

18:20.700 --> 18:22.258
To live his life.

18:24.230 --> 18:25.390
You should talk to him.

18:25.450 --> 18:26.394
Ask him why.

18:26.450 --> 18:27.439
Well, he's a proud man.

18:27.490 --> 18:28.661
He doesn't want his wife

18:28.710 --> 18:29.665
telling him
he's undervaluing himself.

18:29.710 --> 18:30.665
Then you should

18:30.710 --> 18:32.405
talk to PGT Ballistics.

18:32.450 --> 18:34.099
Tell them to pay more.

18:35.110 --> 18:36.327
ALICIA:
This is

18:36.370 --> 18:38.497
a witch hunt, pure and simple.

18:38.550 --> 18:41.451
My husband has done
nothing wrong.

18:41.510 --> 18:43.853
[knocking at door]

18:43.900 --> 18:44.855
Hello.

18:44.900 --> 18:46.720
Mr. Crouse, I need you,

18:46.770 --> 18:48.635
again, to investigate.

18:48.690 --> 18:49.907
Investigate what?

18:49.950 --> 18:50.939
This.

18:54.740 --> 18:56.514
I don't think you want me.

18:56.570 --> 18:57.559
I think I do.

18:58.650 --> 19:01.039
When can you start?

19:01.090 --> 19:02.785
Is this coming
from the governor?

19:02.830 --> 19:04.138
No...

19:04.180 --> 19:05.169
it's coming from me.

19:05.230 --> 19:06.618
Do me a favor.

19:06.660 --> 19:07.740
Talk to the governor.

19:07.790 --> 19:09.052
If he's all right with it,

19:09.100 --> 19:10.533
then I'm all right with it.

19:10.580 --> 19:11.535
I have a better plan.

19:11.580 --> 19:12.922
I'll talk to the governor,

19:12.970 --> 19:14.619
but you start right now.

19:14.670 --> 19:16.365
I need to know what
the prosecutor has

19:16.410 --> 19:17.661
and I'm already behind.

19:27.680 --> 19:28.635
GALLO:
Your Honor,

19:28.680 --> 19:29.635
the United States...
Worship.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.590
Your Worship,

19:31.640 --> 19:32.982
the United States

19:33.040 --> 19:34.257
objects to the admission
of this tape.

19:34.300 --> 19:36.382
It's been
authenticated.
Excuse me,

19:36.430 --> 19:37.818
The Canadian authorities
gave us this tape.I objected to the admission

19:40.650 --> 19:43.039
It doesn't look like
Mr. Dellinger said

19:43.090 --> 19:44.569
anything before
they grabbed him,

19:44.610 --> 19:46.566
therefore he couldn't have lied.

19:46.620 --> 19:47.951
But the angle is...
I reject

19:48.010 --> 19:49.090
the United States' claim

19:49.140 --> 19:50.653
that they're entitled to custody

19:50.710 --> 19:52.837
of Mr. Dellinger.

19:52.880 --> 19:55.485
In that case,
Your Worship,

19:55.540 --> 19:57.269
the United States moves
for extradition.

19:57.320 --> 19:58.491
On what basis?

19:58.540 --> 19:59.620
There's no outstanding warrants

19:59.670 --> 20:00.625
for Mr. Dellinger's arrest.

20:00.670 --> 20:01.978
Actually, there is.

20:02.020 --> 20:03.100
He's wanted for violations

20:03.150 --> 20:04.629
of the Espionage Act.

20:04.680 --> 20:05.669
When was this issued?

20:05.720 --> 20:07.199
Ten minutes ago?

20:07.240 --> 20:08.457
It's a valid warrant,

20:08.510 --> 20:09.852
regardless of when
it was issued.

20:09.900 --> 20:11.060
Your Worship,
they have obviously

20:11.120 --> 20:13.634
detained my client
on a trumped up

20:13.690 --> 20:16.773
pretext to give them time
to get a trumped up warrant.

20:16.820 --> 20:18.594
What exactly is Mr. Dellinger
accused of?

20:18.650 --> 20:20.424
WOMAN [over P.A.]:
Attention, Terminal 3

20:20.480 --> 20:21.640
is a nonsmoking

20:21.690 --> 20:22.645
terminal.

20:22.690 --> 20:24.646
Designated smoking areas

20:24.700 --> 20:26.122
can be found _
throughout the terminal.

20:26.180 --> 20:28.694
As an employee of the
National Security Agency,

20:28.740 --> 20:31.743
he stole and disseminated
classified documents.

20:31.790 --> 20:32.529
That's a lie.

20:32.570 --> 20:33.912
I accidentally
took home

20:33.970 --> 20:35.096
a-a thumb drive.

20:35.140 --> 20:36.528
That, young man,
is a matter

20:36.580 --> 20:38.400
for an American court to decide.

20:38.450 --> 20:41.055
In order to extradite,
the United States need only

20:41.100 --> 20:44.058
to show sufficient evidence
to bring this to trial, which,

20:44.110 --> 20:46.715
I'm afraid, they have.

20:46.760 --> 20:48.284
Do your lawyers
have anything

20:48.330 --> 20:49.672
to present
before I rule?

20:49.720 --> 20:52.712
We do, Your Worship,
uh, but we need time...

20:52.770 --> 20:54.328
to produce a witness.

20:54.380 --> 20:55.415
We've delayed enough already.

20:55.470 --> 20:56.414
Yes, and I'm sure

20:56.470 --> 20:57.687
your work at the NSA

20:57.730 --> 20:58.765
is very important,

20:58.820 --> 21:00.902
surveilling your
country's citizens.

21:00.950 --> 21:02.258
Excuse me, Your Honor,

21:02.300 --> 21:04.200
but I'm not sure
I appreCIate the tone.

21:04.260 --> 21:06.820
I'm only remarking now
as a Canadian citizen.

21:06.870 --> 21:10.567
It would be better if our
neighbors from the south

21:10.610 --> 21:13.340
would try to emulate
the freedoms we enjoy here,

21:13.400 --> 21:18.394
with no surveillance and with
our superior health care system.

21:18.450 --> 21:20.441
Do not leave your
luggage unattended.

21:20.490 --> 21:22.708
Unattended luggage
will be confiscated.

21:22.750 --> 21:24.832
The judge is leaning
towards extradition,

21:24.890 --> 21:28.974
but Dellinger's lawyer,
supposedly, has another witness.

21:29.020 --> 21:30.578
Any idea who that might be?

21:30.630 --> 21:32.325
No, and they're avoiding
all phones right now.

21:32.370 --> 21:34.235
Do we have any other way
to listen?

21:34.290 --> 21:35.803
Any other way to surveil Alicia?

21:35.850 --> 21:37.545
A hot mic, but they
aren't even talking

21:37.600 --> 21:38.760
near their phones 'cause...

21:38.810 --> 21:39.981
Dellinger knows
our tricks.

21:40.030 --> 21:41.850
No, but here's the thing.

21:41.900 --> 21:43.777
If they do have a witness

21:43.820 --> 21:46.425
swearing to Dellinger's
performance, we have a rebuttal.

21:46.470 --> 21:48.995
Who's talking?

21:49.040 --> 21:51.645
The Americans.

21:51.700 --> 21:53.691
NSA, Toronto to Chicago.

21:53.740 --> 21:54.991
What's it about?

21:55.050 --> 21:56.779
Jeff Dellinger.

21:56.830 --> 21:58.741
He's the contractor
the Americans lost last year.

21:58.790 --> 22:00.963
I told you
they'd be after him.

22:01.010 --> 22:02.523
You didn't tell me anything.

22:02.580 --> 22:03.524
It was obvious.

22:03.580 --> 22:04.660
But what's being discussed?

22:04.710 --> 22:05.961
Trial strategy.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.443
Want us to ignore?

22:08.500 --> 22:10.582
No, keep listening.

22:26.990 --> 22:28.423
Nice suit.

22:28.470 --> 22:30.335
You were expecting sweatpants?

22:31.520 --> 22:33.420
You said this wasn't
about the firm.

22:33.480 --> 22:35.300
Peter Florrick.

22:35.350 --> 22:36.908
The Locke mistrial.

22:36.960 --> 22:39.087
Well, I'm sure
you read the file.

22:39.140 --> 22:40.266
I read what's public.

22:40.310 --> 22:42.392
I want to know
what's not.

22:44.660 --> 22:46.525
Richard Locke murdered
his girlfriend,

22:46.580 --> 22:48.309
shot her twice
in the chest.

22:48.360 --> 22:49.839
Our theory was that Locke
was getting two-timed

22:49.890 --> 22:50.879
and he got jealous.

22:50.930 --> 22:51.965
Defense said

22:52.020 --> 22:53.271
it was an accident.

22:53.320 --> 22:54.969
Which was true?

22:55.020 --> 22:57.147
Maybe neither.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.360
But you went to trial.

22:58.420 --> 22:59.842
We had a good case.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.379
We would have gotten
the conviction.

23:01.420 --> 23:04.765
If the bullets
hadn't gone missing.

23:04.810 --> 23:06.027
How'd that happen?

23:06.080 --> 23:07.206
Some people blame

23:07.250 --> 23:08.205
the lead prosecutor;

23:08.250 --> 23:09.205
I blame the crime lab.

23:09.250 --> 23:11.423
They're pretty inept.

23:11.470 --> 23:13.199
So, the lab tech was corrupt.

23:13.260 --> 23:15.342
Probably just sloppy...
incompetent.

23:15.390 --> 23:16.345
That must have

23:16.390 --> 23:17.425
blindsided you.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.209
We were already
at trial.

23:19.260 --> 23:20.989
We turned over
our ballistics testing.

23:21.050 --> 23:22.438
Defense requested

23:22.480 --> 23:24.436
the bullets to do
their own testing.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.094
But when they
couldn't be found...

23:26.140 --> 23:27.619
Judge granted a mistrial,

23:27.660 --> 23:30.959
and since jeopardy was
already attached...

23:31.010 --> 23:33.012
He couldn't be retried.

23:33.060 --> 23:36.757
Connor Fox is gonna say that
Peter ordered someone to lose

23:36.800 --> 23:39.109
those bullets,
and it's more likely

23:39.150 --> 23:40.879
that he leaned
on the lead prosecutor

23:40.940 --> 23:42.805
than some lab tech.

23:42.850 --> 23:45.023
That I will not say.

23:45.070 --> 23:47.288
Anything else I should know?

23:47.330 --> 23:49.412
Just that people change.

23:49.470 --> 23:50.858
Meaning?

23:50.900 --> 23:53.460
Ah, it's just
an observation, I...

23:53.510 --> 23:54.818
I think I know people...

23:54.860 --> 23:56.725
even well.

24:01.130 --> 24:03.178
You talking about
someone in particular?

24:11.530 --> 24:13.225
[sighs]

24:13.270 --> 24:15.318
Does Peter Florrick
have any reason

24:15.360 --> 24:16.577
to be concerned about you?

24:16.620 --> 24:18.349
Me?

24:18.410 --> 24:20.184
Your testimony?

24:20.240 --> 24:22.538
Only if he has reason

24:22.590 --> 24:25.457
to be concerned about the truth.

24:30.550 --> 24:31.539
So, Cary...

24:31.600 --> 24:33.409
thinks the lab is responsible.

24:33.470 --> 24:34.459
He does.

24:34.510 --> 24:36.466
"Inept," "incompetent,"
and "sloppy"

24:36.510 --> 24:37.465
were the words he used.

24:37.510 --> 24:38.511
What's the difference

24:38.560 --> 24:39.515
between inept and incompetent?

24:39.560 --> 24:41.551
About six letters.

24:41.610 --> 24:42.861
That is both correct
and accurate.

24:44.520 --> 24:45.566
You may have
a problem with Cary.

24:45.610 --> 24:46.565
Why?

24:46.610 --> 24:47.565
He's testifying?

24:49.960 --> 24:51.268
Okay, well...

24:51.310 --> 24:52.390
see if you can
get an early look

24:52.440 --> 24:54.579
at the discovery;
I'm getting nothing.

24:54.620 --> 24:56.520
Jason, what are you doing here?

24:56.580 --> 24:58.536
He's our investigator.

24:58.580 --> 25:01.834
Jason, would you excuse us
for a moment?

25:01.890 --> 25:04.313
We need to put
a pin in this.

25:04.370 --> 25:06.099
We need to put
a pin in Jason?

25:06.150 --> 25:07.401
You know what I mean.

25:07.460 --> 25:08.495
I have to talk to Peter.

25:08.550 --> 25:09.494
That's what Jason

25:09.550 --> 25:10.494
suggested.

25:10.550 --> 25:12.154
Is there something I don't know?

25:12.200 --> 25:13.508
No.

25:13.550 --> 25:14.721
He's worked
for us before.

25:14.770 --> 25:16.544
He's still
working for Alicia,

25:16.600 --> 25:18.465
and he's preternaturally calm.Well, I have

25:18.510 --> 25:19.681
to talk to Peter.

25:19.730 --> 25:21.163
But I have free rein
to hire who I want.

25:22.780 --> 25:24.941
No one has free rein.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.514
SECRETARY:
Ms. Lockhart,
PGT Ballistics is here.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.471
Uh, yes, send them back.

25:29.520 --> 25:31.306
So, fair market value?

25:31.350 --> 25:33.170
Higher.

25:33.220 --> 25:34.915
Really?
How much higher?

25:34.960 --> 25:38.179
$600,000.

25:38.230 --> 25:39.174
Seriously?

25:39.230 --> 25:40.481
[knocking at door]

25:40.530 --> 25:43.886
Hello, Diane, Mr. Lee.

25:43.930 --> 25:46.751
Are you with
PGT Ballistics?

25:46.800 --> 25:48.756
I am PGT Ballistics.

25:48.800 --> 25:49.971
Really?

25:50.020 --> 25:51.544
Oh, the name gives
me more gravitas.

25:51.590 --> 25:53.581
Holly Westfall.
Hey.

25:53.630 --> 25:57.589
So, you're a competitor
of Mr. McVeigh's?

25:57.640 --> 25:59.596
More of a
friendly competitor.

25:59.640 --> 26:01.631
I was one of Kurt's
first students.

26:01.690 --> 26:04.079
His favorite,
as he's constantly reminding me.

26:04.120 --> 26:05.644
[laughs]

26:07.910 --> 26:10.219
Would you like me to
take care of this, Diane?

26:10.260 --> 26:11.773
No, let's all sit
down together.

26:11.830 --> 26:13.081
Hmm.

26:13.130 --> 26:15.564
So...

26:15.610 --> 26:17.259
how did you, uh...

26:17.310 --> 26:20.393
hit on the price for
the purchase of Kurt's firm?

26:20.440 --> 26:21.429
Holly, is it?

26:21.490 --> 26:23.617
It is. Oh, I like your necklace.

26:23.660 --> 26:25.616
Oh, thank you.
I have one
just like it,

26:25.670 --> 26:26.614
but smaller.
[chuckles]

26:26.670 --> 26:28.012
Kurt and I were at

26:28.060 --> 26:29.573
a gun show in Wisconsin

26:29.630 --> 26:31.666
and we were talking
about the generational shifts

26:31.720 --> 26:33.199
in the science.

26:33.240 --> 26:35.276
You know, there's old-school
ballistics and new,

26:35.330 --> 26:37.582
and Kurt believes that
you can't teach an old dog

26:37.630 --> 26:39.279
new tricks,
and Ijust kept telling him,

26:39.330 --> 26:40.809
"But you're not old."

26:40.860 --> 26:42.418
Hmm.
And then he

26:42.470 --> 26:43.676
laughed and
I just said...

26:43.730 --> 26:45.504
Ms. Westfall,
you're very charming, I'm sure,

26:45.560 --> 26:49.428
but unless you can pay 30% more,
we're not selling.

26:49.470 --> 26:52.030
Kurt and I had an agreement.

26:52.080 --> 26:54.219
Unfortunately not on paper.

26:54.260 --> 26:57.047
Maybe I should
just talk to Kurt.

26:59.090 --> 27:01.741
I'd be happy to arrange
a meeting for you to sit down

27:01.790 --> 27:04.099
with both of us,
but unless you can increase

27:04.140 --> 27:05.914
your offer, you can go f...

27:21.420 --> 27:22.637
WOMAN [over P.A.]:
Welcome

27:22.680 --> 27:25.319
to Toronto Pearson
International Airport.

27:25.380 --> 27:27.336
Please have your passport
and customs form ready.

27:27.380 --> 27:28.688
Alicia Florrick.

27:28.730 --> 27:31.244
Yes... Tyler?

27:31.300 --> 27:32.642
Yeah.

27:32.690 --> 27:35.557
Oh, you look taller
than I thought.

27:35.610 --> 27:37.168
How is Zach doing?

27:37.220 --> 27:38.824
And, Grace, has she
picked a college yet?

27:38.870 --> 27:41.737
Yes... uh, have
we met before?

27:41.790 --> 27:43.519
No, this is the first time.

27:45.270 --> 27:46.567
You worked with
Jeff Dellinger?

27:46.620 --> 27:49.612
For five years,
cubicle by cubicle.

27:49.660 --> 27:52.447
And you were working
with him, next to him,

27:52.490 --> 27:54.924
when this alleged
espionage took place?

27:54.970 --> 27:56.699
I don't know why they
call it espionage.

27:56.760 --> 27:58.239
He took home a flash drive...

27:58.280 --> 27:59.668
accidentally.

27:59.720 --> 28:00.880
It was classified.Yeah, but you only

28:00.940 --> 28:02.714
classified it after the fact,

28:02.760 --> 28:04.716
after you started
scapegoating him.

28:04.770 --> 28:07.933
Mr. Froines,
to your knowledge,

28:07.990 --> 28:09.719
did Mr. Dellinger access

28:09.770 --> 28:12.159
classified documents
and information

28:12.210 --> 28:13.290
while he worked
underyou?

28:13.340 --> 28:14.591
He did more that that.

28:14.640 --> 28:17.256
He... downloaded
classified material

28:17.300 --> 28:18.642
and leaked it to journalists.DELLINGER: What?!

28:18.690 --> 28:19.816
This is incredible,
the story just keeps...

28:19.870 --> 28:20.814
Mr. Dellinger,

28:20.870 --> 28:22.474
politeness, please!

28:22.520 --> 28:23.737
GALLO:
Your Worship, the leaking
of classified material...

28:23.780 --> 28:24.781
[whispering]:
He's lying.

28:24.830 --> 28:26.525
He hates me because
I got him fired.

28:26.570 --> 28:28.083
...is, as you know, the very
definition of espionage.

28:28.140 --> 28:29.391
You said you were

28:29.440 --> 28:30.919
a former senior advisor
at the NSA,

28:30.970 --> 28:31.914
Mr. Froines.

28:31.970 --> 28:33.574
Why were you fired?

28:36.540 --> 28:39.100
On suspicion of eavesdropping
on my ex-wife.

28:39.150 --> 28:40.094
Did Mr. Dellinger

28:40.150 --> 28:41.663
play a role in your firing?

28:43.150 --> 28:44.936
He made the allegations.

28:44.980 --> 28:46.754
Your Worship, may I

28:46.810 --> 28:48.107
recall Tyler Hopkins?

28:48.160 --> 28:49.320
He's sitting right over there.

28:49.370 --> 28:51.418
Just ask him a question.

28:51.460 --> 28:52.768
You've maintained
your friendship With

28:52.810 --> 28:53.765
Jeff Dellinger since

28:53.810 --> 28:55.505
he left the NSA,
and occasionally

28:55.550 --> 28:56.596
you two talk on the phone?

28:56.640 --> 28:58.551
Yeah.
I'd like to

28:58.600 --> 28:59.771
play one of those
phone calls for you now.

28:59.820 --> 29:00.775
Objection!

29:00.820 --> 29:02.469
We have no way of knowing

29:02.520 --> 29:03.646
if this recording is authentic

29:03.690 --> 29:04.770
or if it was
legally obtained.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.081
Let's play
the recording

29:06.130 --> 29:07.995
and take it_ one
step at a time.

29:08.050 --> 29:10.518
That's how we do
things in Canada.

29:10.570 --> 29:11.787
HOPKINS:
They're gonna kill an American.

29:11.830 --> 29:12.785
DELLINGER:
Who is?

29:12.830 --> 29:13.876
HOPKINS:
The military.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.740
They're gonna take out this guy

29:15.790 --> 29:17.701
Massoud Tahan.

29:17.750 --> 29:19.001
They convened a panel
to convict him.

29:19.060 --> 29:20.664
He's not even a frontline guy.

29:20.710 --> 29:22.223
He's a recruiter.

29:22.280 --> 29:23.793
GALLO:
Mr. Hopkins, that was
your voice, wasn't it?

29:23.840 --> 29:24.795
LUCCA:
He's not answering that.

29:24.850 --> 29:25.794
GALLO:
You don't need to.

29:25.850 --> 29:27.329
Mr. Hopkins committed

29:27.370 --> 29:28.405
a serious security leak

29:28.460 --> 29:29.404
by sharing that information

29:29.460 --> 29:30.495
with Mr. Dellinger,

29:30.550 --> 29:32.324
but Mr. Dellinger
then committed

29:32.370 --> 29:34.509
an_ even more
serious offense

29:34.550 --> 29:36.029
by sending that information

29:36.070 --> 29:38.812
to both the State Department
and WikiLeaks.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.077
Your Worship,

29:40.120 --> 29:41.678
may I have a moment
with my client?

29:41.730 --> 29:42.810
WOMAN [over P.A.]:
Attention, Terminal 3

29:42.860 --> 29:44.339
is a nonsmoking terminal.

29:44.390 --> 29:46.073
Go ahead, yes!

29:46.130 --> 29:48.553
Designated smoking areas can be
found throughout the terminal.

29:48.610 --> 29:49.565
Is it true?

29:49.610 --> 29:51.214
Did you leak?

29:51.260 --> 29:52.568
People have
a right to know

29:52.610 --> 29:53.861
what America is doing

29:53.920 --> 29:55.785
in _the name of
national security.

29:55.830 --> 29:57.821
I was on that panel, Jeff.

29:57.880 --> 30:00.314
Someone else was blamed
for what you did

30:00.360 --> 30:02.487
and got fired
after 24 years

30:02.530 --> 30:03.701
of honorable service.

30:03.750 --> 30:05.706
So don't play
the idealist to me.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.752
Designated smoking areas can be
found throughout the terminal.

30:08.800 --> 30:10.882
I was on the panel
that made the decision

30:10.930 --> 30:12.363
to kill Massoud Tahan.

30:12.410 --> 30:14.150
Someone else was blamed
for that leak,

30:14.200 --> 30:15.417
a Captain Terrence Hicks.

30:15.460 --> 30:16.415
I can neither

30:16.460 --> 30:18.155
confirm nor deny.

30:18.200 --> 30:19.280
Well, I can.

30:19.330 --> 30:20.934
Actually, you can't!

30:20.990 --> 30:23.151
You swore confidentiality
on that panel.

30:23.210 --> 30:24.939
You shouldn't even
be telling me about it.

30:24.990 --> 30:26.855
Well, you can't blame both
Captain Hicks andJeff Dellinger

30:26.910 --> 30:27.854
for the same leak.

30:27.910 --> 30:28.865
I don't.

30:28.910 --> 30:30.866
I only blame Jeff,

30:30.910 --> 30:32.514
and you can't say whatever it is

30:32.560 --> 30:33.868
you think you know

30:33.910 --> 30:36.219
unless you'd like to face
an espionage charge.

30:39.530 --> 30:41.088
Jason Crouse.

30:41.140 --> 30:42.266
Are you kidding?

30:42.310 --> 30:43.868
He's worked for us before.

30:43.920 --> 30:46.445
He still works for Alicia
and he's very... calm.

30:46.490 --> 30:48.355
Find somebody else.

30:48.410 --> 30:49.707
Mr. Governor, if this has
anything to do with your...

30:49.760 --> 30:50.886
Eli...

30:50.930 --> 30:52.363
find somebody else.
We can't

30:52.410 --> 30:53.889
be overruling Tascioni.

30:53.930 --> 30:55.101
He needs to work with him,
we don't.

30:55.150 --> 30:56.583
[sighs]

30:59.460 --> 31:02.509
Alicia is divorcing me.

31:06.290 --> 31:07.985
Oh.

31:12.910 --> 31:15.515
You didn't know?

31:15.560 --> 31:17.778
No.

31:17.830 --> 31:19.695
Did you explain to her
how that would look?

31:19.740 --> 31:21.264
We're putting it in place now.

31:21.310 --> 31:23.084
We won't activate it
until after the trial.

31:23.140 --> 31:24.391
Well, that's good.
Yes,

31:24.440 --> 31:26.396
I'm... thrilled.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.353
Oh...

31:29.400 --> 31:30.401
Peter...

31:32.320 --> 31:34.140
I'm sorry.

31:36.890 --> 31:38.278
I truly am.

31:40.150 --> 31:42.323
Thank you.

31:42.370 --> 31:45.419
Attention, Terminal 3
is a nonsmoking terminal.

31:45.460 --> 31:46.939
Designated smoking areas

31:46.990 --> 31:49.857
can be found _
throughout the terminal.

31:49.900 --> 31:51.299
Mr. Hopkins,

31:51.340 --> 31:52.591
how did you come to know about

31:52.640 --> 31:54.995
Massoud Ta_han's
assassmation?
Objection.

31:55.040 --> 31:56.598
This is classified.ALICIA:
He opened the door.

31:56.650 --> 31:57.605
If he wants
the recording

31:57.650 --> 31:59.208
to come in as evidence,

31:59.260 --> 32:00.955
then I must be allowed
to fully cross-examine

32:01.000 --> 32:02.956
the witness on
what was discussed.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.399
He can't have his cake
and eat it, too.

32:04.440 --> 32:05.737
This is_ a national
security matter!

32:05.790 --> 32:06.779
Everything in America

32:06.830 --> 32:07.910
is a national security

32:07.960 --> 32:08.961
matter,
but either you

32:09.010 --> 32:10.739
withdraw the recording,

32:10.790 --> 32:14.442
or the NSA's dirty undies
get aired here and now.

32:14.490 --> 32:16.958
Now, then...

32:17.020 --> 32:19.409
how did you come to know
about the assassination?

32:19.450 --> 32:22.749
We turned her cell phone into
a hot mic that we could control

32:22.810 --> 32:24.619
remotely without her knowing it.

32:24.680 --> 32:27.808
Whose cell phone?

32:27.850 --> 32:29.636
Hers.

32:32.160 --> 32:34.071
What are you thinking?

32:35.690 --> 32:37.112
I'm thinking
they've been

32:37.170 --> 32:39.388
listening to me
for months...

32:39.430 --> 32:40.385
to everything...

32:40.430 --> 32:43.160
to Jason...

32:43.220 --> 32:46.781
but I'm also thinking
the judge is on our side now.

32:46.830 --> 32:48.309
What are you thinking?

32:49.480 --> 32:51.619
I'm thinking our client
is guilty.

32:51.660 --> 32:53.742
We've represented
guilty clients before.

32:53.790 --> 32:54.745
Not like this.

32:54.790 --> 32:55.870
He went to WikiLeaks

32:55.930 --> 32:58.490
about a military action.

32:58.540 --> 33:01.976
That, to me, is treason.

33:02.020 --> 33:03.146
Is it not to you?

33:10.770 --> 33:12.021
VALENTINE:
Now, then...

33:12.070 --> 33:14.675
I have thought long

33:14.730 --> 33:17.335
and hard about this issue,

33:17.380 --> 33:18.813
and based on what

33:18.860 --> 33:20.851
I have heard,
I find there is sufficient

33:20.910 --> 33:23.902
evidence to substantiate

33:23.950 --> 33:26.737
the espionage charge; therefore,
Mr. Dellinger's extradition

33:26.780 --> 33:28.828
is hereby approved.

33:28.870 --> 33:31.259
Ma'am, we have one more
motion to be considered.

33:31.310 --> 33:32.265
We do?

33:32.310 --> 33:33.470
Yes?

33:33.530 --> 33:36.351
Could you live in Canada?

33:36.400 --> 33:37.264
What?

33:37.310 --> 33:38.743
If the alternative is jail,

33:38.790 --> 33:40.838
could you live in Canada?

33:40.880 --> 33:43.269
Uh... yes.

33:43.320 --> 33:45.231
Alicia.

33:45.280 --> 33:47.362
VALENTINE:
Mrs. Florrick...

33:47.410 --> 33:49.366
you have a motion.

33:49.410 --> 33:51.321
Yes, ma'am, we request asylum.

33:51.370 --> 33:52.450
Are you kidding?!

33:52.500 --> 33:53.489
Jeff Dellinger is a person

33:53.550 --> 33:54.676
in need of protection.

33:54.720 --> 33:55.675
He's a traitor,

33:55.720 --> 33:57.119
who leaked classified

33:57.160 --> 33:58.934
agency information.

34:02.380 --> 34:03.779
Is there a problem,
Your Worship?

34:03.820 --> 34:04.775
No.

34:04.820 --> 34:06.549
No...

34:06.600 --> 34:09.342
I will take this
under advisement.

34:09.390 --> 34:12.644
Who is that man?

34:12.700 --> 34:14.395
I...

34:14.440 --> 34:15.828
heard Gallo
talking earlier.

34:15.870 --> 34:17.269
He's from the CSE.

34:17.310 --> 34:18.299
What's CSE?

34:18.360 --> 34:19.349
The Communications

34:19.400 --> 34:21.356
Security Establishment.

34:21.400 --> 34:24.483
It's a Canadian
version of the NSA.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.752
I think we should talk.

34:30.800 --> 34:33.496
Okay.

34:33.540 --> 34:34.677
I have faults.

34:34.720 --> 34:35.800
I'm, uh...

34:35.850 --> 34:37.670
easily mesmerized by people

34:37.720 --> 34:40.109
who use multi-syllabled words

34:40.160 --> 34:44.506
and, um, men who can
discuss Tolstoy.

34:44.560 --> 34:46.903
You never told me that.

34:46.950 --> 34:48.554
Yes, because I don't

34:48.600 --> 34:51.125
like my failings...

34:51.170 --> 34:54.901
but in the middle of the
night when I review my day,

34:54.960 --> 34:58.396
I know that if a man has
quoted Tolstoy to me,

34:58.440 --> 35:02.524
I would be more likely
to cut him a break.

35:02.570 --> 35:04.265
I'm disappointed in you.

35:04.310 --> 35:06.187
Yes.

35:06.230 --> 35:08.357
I tell you this so that

35:08.410 --> 35:10.355
we can now_ discuss
your failings.

35:10.410 --> 35:12.014
Ah.

35:12.060 --> 35:13.789
Yes.

35:13.850 --> 35:18.628
You are easily swayed by pretty,
young, blonde Republicans.

35:21.330 --> 35:23.412
This is about my sale to PGT.

35:23.460 --> 35:25.508
Yes.

35:25.550 --> 35:26.596
I already shook on it.

35:26.640 --> 35:29.029
Yes, well, that
means nothing to me.

35:29.080 --> 35:32.425
You have undervalued
your company

35:32.470 --> 35:33.812
by half a million dollars.

35:33.870 --> 35:34.814
I doubt that.

35:34.870 --> 35:36.519
Don't doubt that.

35:36.560 --> 35:38.346
Kurt, this is my plan.

35:38.390 --> 35:41.439
I am going to sell
your company

35:41.480 --> 35:43.436
at its appropriate value
and then I'm gonna put

35:43.480 --> 35:47.359
$500,000 in a fund
for you to use to hire

35:47.400 --> 35:49.743
Republican strippers to
your heart's content.

35:49.790 --> 35:51.576
Okay, thanks.

35:51.620 --> 35:55.579
Kurt, you are not gonna sell
your company to some blonde...

35:55.630 --> 35:58.497
She is the top ballistics
expert in the county.

35:58.540 --> 35:59.939
And she dresses like one.

36:01.550 --> 36:03.324
I have a handshake
agreement with her.

36:03.370 --> 36:04.325
I'm honoring it.

36:04.370 --> 36:06.247
Over my dead body.

36:06.290 --> 36:09.066
How are you?

36:09.120 --> 36:12.556
Better than I
would have thought.

36:12.600 --> 36:14.943
The Sun-Timessays
it's a witch hunt.

36:14.990 --> 36:18.255
I know, I,
I read that.

36:18.300 --> 36:19.688
And you looked good.

36:21.570 --> 36:23.083
On my perp walk?

36:23.130 --> 36:25.519
[laughs]

36:25.570 --> 36:27.743
The media seems sympathetic.

36:30.140 --> 36:31.573
How's
you
r
case goi
ng?

36:31.620 --> 36:33.440
Oh, we should get
the decision tomorrow.

36:33.490 --> 36:35.742
The justice seems
to be on our side.

36:35.800 --> 36:37.700
Oh, just in time
for mother's party.

36:37.760 --> 36:41.400
Yeah, just in time.

36:41.460 --> 36:44.543
Connor Fox sent_ over
a plea bargain.

36:44.590 --> 36:47.366
Well, that's a good sign.

36:47.420 --> 36:48.375
What is it?

36:48.420 --> 36:50.456
Three years.

36:50.510 --> 36:52.023
Probation?

37:00.210 --> 37:02.258
Oh, my God.

37:02.300 --> 37:04.473
Yeah, I know.

37:04.520 --> 37:06.647
Well, what...

37:06.700 --> 37:09.260
what does Tascioni say?

37:11.700 --> 37:15.875
He says they have a case.

37:19.320 --> 37:20.833
Oh, my God.

37:20.890 --> 37:23.620
[exhales]

37:23.670 --> 37:27.015
So we're right back
where we started, huh?

37:37.380 --> 37:40.429
I am standing beside
my husband again

37:40.470 --> 37:42.256
because I know
that he's innocent.

37:42.300 --> 37:43.904
NEWSCASTER:
This is the second time...

37:43.950 --> 37:46.123
What makes you think it'll work?

37:46.170 --> 37:47.990
LUCCA:
Because Dellinger
has something to offer.

37:48.040 --> 37:49.439
What's that?

37:49.480 --> 37:51.653
He knows the ins and outs
of the NSA.

37:51.700 --> 37:53.304
He knows how they hot-mic.

37:53.350 --> 37:54.658
So...

37:54.700 --> 37:56.133
So, Dellinger was telling me

37:56.180 --> 37:57.966
about the Canadian CSE...

37:58.010 --> 38:00.478
how the NSA does
surveillance on it.

38:00.530 --> 38:02.316
What are they
talking about?
Shh.

38:02.360 --> 38:03.406
Do we do that?
Shh.

38:03.450 --> 38:04.963
That's one of the reasons why

38:05.020 --> 38:07.750
the NSA is working so hard
to get Dellinger back.

38:07.800 --> 38:10.974
They don't want
the Canadians to have him.

38:11.020 --> 38:12.749
Call the system admin.

38:12.810 --> 38:14.152
Why?

38:14.200 --> 38:16.020
Because I know
what they're doing.

38:16.070 --> 38:18.152
Kim Cattrall?

38:18.200 --> 38:19.155
Canadian.

38:19.200 --> 38:20.508
Tommy Chong?

38:20.550 --> 38:21.630
American.

38:21.690 --> 38:22.816
No, Canadian.

38:22.860 --> 38:24.771
Tommy Chong is
not Canadian.

38:24.820 --> 38:26.993
Alberta, Canada,
I swear.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.382
Dana Carvey?

38:28.430 --> 38:29.419
LUCCA:
That's one of the reasons why

38:29.480 --> 38:30.731
the NSA is working so hard

38:30.780 --> 38:31.951
to get Dellinger back.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.651
They don't want
the Canadians to have him.

38:34.700 --> 38:36.349
Ike, get McGuire.

38:36.400 --> 38:37.651
They just mentioned us.

38:49.230 --> 38:51.846
After further reflection,
I am granting Mr. Dellinger's

38:51.890 --> 38:54.063
request for asylum
here in Canada.

38:54.110 --> 38:54.883
What?!

38:54.940 --> 38:56.840
You got to be kidding me.

38:56.890 --> 39:00.189
I don't understand
what just happened. What...

39:00.250 --> 39:01.933
You're a valuable asset.

39:01.990 --> 39:03.639
The Canadians want
you for themselves.

39:03.680 --> 39:04.635
Are you serious?

39:04.690 --> 39:05.634
McGUIRE:
Mr. Dellinger,

39:05.690 --> 39:08.329
might I have a word?

39:11.040 --> 39:13.383
[knocking at door]

39:13.430 --> 39:15.512
You wanted to talk?

39:18.610 --> 39:21.078
Kurt, I'm sorry.

39:21.140 --> 39:22.789
It's your business, not mine.

39:24.710 --> 39:26.132
You should sell it
if you want

39:26.180 --> 39:29.263
to whomever you want
for whatever you want.

39:35.460 --> 39:37.405
I'm gonna look
for another buyer.

39:37.460 --> 39:39.109
We don't need the money.

39:39.150 --> 39:40.458
You should do what you want.

39:40.500 --> 39:41.808
Iam.

39:43.940 --> 39:46.067
I'm gonna look
for another buyer.

39:46.120 --> 39:48.759
Why?

39:52.170 --> 39:54.422
Because I love you.

39:59.260 --> 40:01.865
You make me happy, Kurt.

40:02.960 --> 40:04.871
I know.

40:30.640 --> 40:33.336
Hi.

40:33.380 --> 40:36.247
Hi.

40:36.300 --> 40:38.165
It's been a while.

40:39.690 --> 40:41.738
I heard Toronto
went well.

40:41.780 --> 40:43.259
[sighs]

40:43.310 --> 40:44.345
It did.

40:49.310 --> 40:51.961
You want something to eat?

40:52.010 --> 40:54.262
No.

41:01.500 --> 41:02.979
When I told you I was divorcing,

41:03.020 --> 41:05.238
I didn't mean for it
to throw us off.

41:05.280 --> 41:08.101
I know.

41:09.510 --> 41:11.375
But it did throw us off?

41:16.380 --> 41:17.984
What do you want, Alicia?

41:18.040 --> 41:19.075
What do I want?

41:19.120 --> 41:20.519
Yeah.

41:20.560 --> 41:22.733
Why are you
getting divorced?

41:24.000 --> 41:26.161
Uh...

41:26.220 --> 41:27.562
you may have heard,

41:27.610 --> 41:29.692
my husband slept
with prostitutes.

41:29.740 --> 41:31.958
That was seven years ago.

41:33.960 --> 41:35.484
Why now?

41:36.580 --> 41:38.969
Because I want to.

41:39.010 --> 41:41.535
Because the kids
are leavmg home.

41:41.580 --> 41:43.138
Because...

41:43.190 --> 41:44.669
everything.

41:44.710 --> 41:47.019
What do you want, Jason?

41:49.410 --> 41:50.752
I want things simple.

41:50.810 --> 41:51.799
Yes, I know.

41:51.850 --> 41:54.239
So you've said.

41:54.290 --> 41:57.202
Unfortunately,
things aren't simple.

41:59.600 --> 42:02.034
I'm not simple.

42:02.080 --> 42:03.513
Nothing's simple.

42:03.560 --> 42:05.687
Okay.

42:10.700 --> 42:13.305
Then what do you want?

42:15.270 --> 42:17.738
[sighs]

42:19.230 --> 42:20.788
You.
