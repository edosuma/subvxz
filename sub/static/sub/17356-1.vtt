01:58.185 --> 01:59.885
- Okay, what and why
is this happening?

01:59.887 --> 02:02.421
- I knew a storm was coming,
so I prepared

02:02.423 --> 02:03.589
a night of scary stories.

02:03.591 --> 02:07.693

02:23.744 --> 02:26.178
- No, Colosso,
we're superheroes, okay?

02:26.180 --> 02:29.214
There's no story you could
tell that would frighten us.

02:29.216 --> 02:30.315
- Challenge accepted!

02:30.317 --> 02:32.184

03:23.137 --> 03:25.971
- If you eat more than
one piece of candy a day--

03:25.973 --> 03:29.808
- A mean, ugly troll
will come out of the bowl--

03:29.810 --> 03:35.414
- And get you.
- [audience laughter]

03:37.318 --> 03:38.684

04:18.592 --> 04:19.391
You caught us!

04:35.976 --> 04:36.908
Why did you knock me over?

04:36.910 --> 04:39.478
- One of us had to live
to tell the story.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.379
- [audience laughter]

04:40.381 --> 04:42.914
- Good thinking.

And if they find out,
we can just eat them.

08:40.621 --> 08:41.753
- [audience laughter]

08:41.755 --> 08:45.090
- You're not eating anyone
because you're not going.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.024
- Come on, Dad.
- What?!

08:46.026 --> 08:48.226
- We know it's been hard since
the monster league

08:48.228 --> 08:51.696
moved us to Humanville,
but we have to be careful.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.598
No going out without
your disguises.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.166
- Come on, we promise
we won't let anyone

08:55.168 --> 08:56.234
discover our family secret.

08:56.236 --> 08:59.004
- Yeah, or let anyone
use Nora's toilet paper.

08:59.006 --> 08:59.971
- [audience laughter]

08:59.973 --> 09:01.840
- Sorry, but we can't
trust Chloe

09:01.842 --> 09:04.242
and her little zombie appetite.
- [audience laughter]

09:04.244 --> 09:05.977
- Little?
She ate the brains of half

09:05.979 --> 09:07.879
the original cast of Hamilton.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.180
- [audience laughter]

09:09.182 --> 09:10.949
- Mmm, brains.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.284
- [audience laughter]

09:12.286 --> 09:14.686
- What if we got
Chloe a babysitter?

09:14.688 --> 09:17.389
- Could work,
but we'd have to find someone

09:17.391 --> 09:18.890
without any brains.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.258
- [slurps]
- [audience laughter]

09:20.260 --> 09:21.927
- Thanks for thinking of me.
- [audience laughter]

09:21.929 --> 09:24.696
- Chloe and I are
gonna have so much fun.

09:24.698 --> 09:25.430
- [audience laughter]

09:25.432 --> 09:28.800
- How could you leave
me home, you monsters?

09:28.802 --> 09:30.802
- [audience laughter]

09:30.804 --> 09:32.938
- You remember the rules, right?

09:32.940 --> 09:34.306
- If you sprinkle
when you tinkle,

09:34.308 --> 09:36.675
be a sweetie
and wipe the seatie.

09:36.677 --> 09:37.842
- [audience laughter]

09:37.844 --> 09:39.344
- She means about
watching Chloe.

09:39.346 --> 09:40.345
- Oh.
- [audience laughter]

09:40.347 --> 09:42.314
- Yeah.
If Chloe's out of sight,

09:42.316 --> 09:44.082
then things are not alright.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.216
- [audience laughter]

09:45.218 --> 09:46.952
- I feel good about
this, let's go.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.386
- [audience laughter]

09:48.388 --> 09:52.257
- So, Chloe, what do
you wanna play first?

09:52.259 --> 09:53.758
[slurps]

09:53.760 --> 09:54.993
Oh, brain freeze.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.195
- [audience laughter]
- You have a brain?

09:57.197 --> 09:59.097
- [audience laughter]
- Of course, why?

09:59.099 --> 10:01.967
- I'm just asking for a friend.

10:01.969 --> 10:04.302
- [audience laughter]

10:04.304 --> 10:09.407
- ¶

10:09.810 --> 10:12.877
- Remember, no howling,
no spell casting,

10:12.879 --> 10:13.878
no weird bug stuff,

10:13.880 --> 10:15.947
and no whatever
it is mummies do.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.983
- [growls]
- Yeah, that, don't do that.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.384
- [audience laughter]

10:19.386 --> 10:22.420
- Happy Halloween, losers.
- [audience laughter]

10:22.422 --> 10:24.055
- Why aren't you wearing
a costume, Mrs. Wong?

10:24.057 --> 10:27.959
- I am, I'm dressed
as an over-worked restauranteur

10:27.961 --> 10:30.295
who knows there's something
weird about your family.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.297
- I'm not a real witch!
- [audience laughter]

10:32.299 --> 10:35.967
- What she means is we're
all wearing costumes.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.435
- [audience laughter]

10:37.437 --> 10:39.404
- You look like an actual bug.

10:39.406 --> 10:43.708
- If I was, would I be able to
resist flying into that light?

10:43.710 --> 10:44.442
- [audience laughter]

10:44.444 --> 10:48.747
- That warm, beautiful,
let me at it!

10:48.749 --> 10:50.148
- [audience laughter]

10:50.150 --> 10:53.151
- Every family has a weird one.
- [audience laughter]

10:53.153 --> 10:54.753
- Your family has a lot of them.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.955
- [audience laughter]

10:56.957 --> 10:58.723
- I'll be watching you.

10:58.725 --> 10:59.758
- [audience laughter]

10:59.760 --> 11:01.493
- Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.428
- Hey don't worry,
just act natural

11:03.430 --> 11:06.398
and everything will be fine.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.366
- ¶

11:08.368 --> 11:09.300

- Stop that.
Down, boy, down, down.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.874
- [audience laughter]

11:15.876 --> 11:17.142
- Wong saw that.

11:17.144 --> 11:19.778
- One more slip-up
and we are going home.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.347
And you are going to the kennel.
- [chomps]

11:22.349 --> 11:24.249
- [audience laughter]

11:24.251 --> 11:26.785
- Ow!

11:26.787 --> 11:29.320

- [scoffs] How dare you?

11:29.322 --> 11:31.456
Jerkus broccoletus.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.858
- [audience laughter]

11:33.860 --> 11:35.226
- I was right!

11:35.228 --> 11:37.262

11:37.264 --> 11:38.930
- Somebody order broccoli?

11:38.932 --> 11:39.931
- [audience laughter]

11:39.933 --> 11:42.867
- You weirdos are real monsters.

11:42.869 --> 11:43.835
Get them!

11:43.837 --> 11:45.537
- [audience laughter]

11:45.539 --> 11:47.338

11:47.340 --> 11:49.274

11:49.276 --> 11:51.109
- Bed, Bath and Pitch Forks.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.477
- [audience laughter]

11:52.479 --> 11:53.445
- What do we do?

11:53.447 --> 11:56.014
- Win them over, with dance.

11:56.016 --> 11:58.483
Humans love when
monsters dance.

with your funky moves.

Get them!

12:37.190 --> 12:38.389
- Chloe?

12:38.391 --> 12:40.492

12:40.494 --> 12:41.526
- [audience laughter]

12:41.528 --> 12:44.129
- I'm not scared
of no mini monster,

12:44.131 --> 12:45.330
what are you gonna do?

12:45.332 --> 12:48.867
- Eat your brains, baby.
- [audience laughter]

12:48.869 --> 12:51.569

12:53.173 --> 12:56.307

we're moving again.

13:00.881 --> 13:01.579

13:01.581 --> 13:04.849

be a scary monster.

13:04.851 --> 13:08.119
- Oh, honey, there's
nothing to be scared of.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.288
Now let's go upstairs
and lock your door.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.157
- [audience laughter]

13:12.159 --> 13:13.525
- Can't believe
that scared them.

13:13.527 --> 13:16.161
Zombies are about
as real as...

13:16.163 --> 13:17.028
Colosso's fur extensions.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.897
- Oh, I knew it.
- [audience laughter]

13:18.899 --> 13:22.567
- You must feel like a big bunny
scaring a poor little girl.

13:22.569 --> 13:25.036
- You're talking about
Chloe, or yourself?

13:25.038 --> 13:30.408
- Oh, I am not scared,
I am a Thunderman. [screams]

13:30.410 --> 13:31.576
Thunderman, away.

13:31.578 --> 13:32.577
- [audience laughter]

13:32.579 --> 13:33.978
- [maniacal laughter]

13:33.980 --> 13:35.480

booked a flight

13:35.482 --> 13:37.549
on American Scare-lines.

13:37.551 --> 13:39.017
- [audience laughter]

13:39.019 --> 13:42.220

the last two standing.

13:42.222 --> 13:47.192
And I've saved
the scariest story for you.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.026

14:02.442 --> 14:05.910
¶ Like little babies ¶
- [audience laughter]

14:05.912 --> 14:08.546
- Why didn't we just take
our chances with the lightning?

14:08.548 --> 14:09.314
- [audience laughter]

14:09.316 --> 14:11.382
- Just face it, Colosso,
you're never gonna scare us.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.184
- Yeah and is this
gonna last much longer?

14:13.186 --> 14:15.987
I'm starving.
- Survive this last story,

14:15.989 --> 14:17.956
and I'll give you chicken
tenders.

14:17.958 --> 14:20.291

Phoebe The Vampire Slayer.

we're running late.

14:34.608 --> 14:37.242
- For school?
- No, for our morning selife.

14:37.244 --> 14:40.111
- [audience laughter]

14:40.113 --> 14:41.446
- [camera clicks]
- Max.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.982
Come on, you ruined our selfie.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.049
- [hisses]

14:45.051 --> 14:47.285
- [audience laughter]

14:48.488 --> 14:51.589
- Did Max just hiss at us?
- [audience laughter]

14:51.591 --> 14:52.590
- Yeah that was weird.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.359
And has he stopped
wearing his retainer?

14:54.361 --> 14:56.928
Because his teeth
looked all jacked up.

14:56.930 --> 14:57.662
- [audience laughter]

14:57.664 --> 14:59.397
- He's been acting
strange lately.

14:59.399 --> 15:02.066
Sleeps all day,
stays up all night.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.235
He even started
a blood drive at school.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.637
- Max is doing charity?

15:05.639 --> 15:08.039
Maybe he's turning
into a nice person.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.140
- Or a vampire.

15:09.142 --> 15:12.510
- [laughing]

15:12.512 --> 15:15.346
- [audience laughter]

15:15.348 --> 15:17.649
- Wait a second, can I see
that selfie we just took?

15:17.651 --> 15:20.218
Vampires don't
show up in photos.

15:21.187 --> 15:22.253
He's not there.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.121
- [audience gasps]

15:23.123 --> 15:25.657
- I'm sure there's
a perfectly good explanation

15:25.659 --> 15:27.458
for all of this.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.427
- The explanation
is he's a vampire.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.528
- [audience laughter]

15:30.530 --> 15:32.297
- Let's get out
of here, quietly.

15:32.299 --> 15:33.364
- Okay.

15:33.366 --> 15:34.532
Sleep tight, Max.

15:34.534 --> 15:37.268
- [audience laughter]

15:37.270 --> 15:39.604
- What are you guys
doing in my lair?

15:39.606 --> 15:40.271
- [laughs]

15:40.273 --> 15:43.041
Just wanted to see
if you were a vampire.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.008

15:44.010 --> 15:45.410

Me, a vampire? What?

15:50.550 --> 15:51.449

15:51.451 --> 15:53.551
- Max, you were
hanging upside down.

15:53.553 --> 15:56.354
- Maybe you were
the ones hanging upside down.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.089
- [audience laughter]
- Ever think of that?

15:58.091 --> 15:59.257
- [audience laughter]
- I didn't.

15:59.259 --> 16:01.492
Phoebe, are we vampires?
- [audience laughter]

16:01.494 --> 16:04.662
- No, Cherry, Max is
lying through his fangs.

16:04.664 --> 16:05.463
He's the vampire.

16:05.465 --> 16:10.001
- Ladies, let's talk
about this over breakfast.

16:10.003 --> 16:11.669
By the way,
you're the breakfast.

it's just homework.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.088

17:04.090 --> 17:05.089
Max can't follow us.

17:05.091 --> 17:09.660
- Phoebe, I have a feeling that
Max isn't the only vampire.

17:09.662 --> 17:12.797
- [audience laughter]

17:12.799 --> 17:14.098
- If they can't go
out in daylight,

17:14.100 --> 17:16.667
how'd they all get to school?

17:16.669 --> 17:17.602
Umbrellas?

17:17.604 --> 17:19.637
Smart and stylish.
- [audience laughter]

17:19.639 --> 17:21.706
- I don't wanna be a vampire.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.775
Let's hide in the bathroom.

how to defeat vampires.

Remember our favorite
teen vamp romance novel?

17:33.253 --> 17:34.852
- [gasps]
"The Fault in Our Neck Scars"?

17:34.854 --> 17:36.821
Team Dimitri
'til the day I die,

17:36.823 --> 17:38.423
which might be today.

17:38.425 --> 17:39.257
- [audience laughter]

17:39.259 --> 17:41.292
- In the book they used
garlic to turn the head vampire

17:41.294 --> 17:43.194
back to human,
then all the other vampires

17:43.196 --> 17:44.662
turned back, too.
- [gasps]

17:44.664 --> 17:46.831
Dimitri is so cute.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.266

17:48.268 --> 17:51.102
Max organized the blood
drive, so he must be the leader,

17:51.104 --> 17:54.172
but...where are we
gonna get garlic?

17:54.174 --> 17:57.275
- Look, it's Italian
Tuesday in the cafeteria.

17:57.277 --> 17:57.875
I'll go load up.

17:57.877 --> 18:01.245
- I'll stay here and pretend
like I don't have a neck.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.714
- [audience laughter]

18:03.716 --> 18:07.285
- No neck Cherry,
nothing to bite here.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.554
- [audience laughter]

18:09.556 --> 18:11.122

without an umbrella?

18:21.434 --> 18:22.700
- Sunblock.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.168
- [audience laughter]

18:24.170 --> 18:25.470

18:25.472 --> 18:27.705
- Have I told you
about my blood drive?

18:27.707 --> 18:29.540
cause you're about to donate.

18:29.542 --> 18:30.575
- [audience laughter]

18:30.577 --> 18:32.443
- Hey, Count Dork-ula.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.878
Do you like garlic?

18:33.880 --> 18:35.179
- [hisses]

18:35.181 --> 18:36.581
- [audience laughter]
- Wait.

18:36.583 --> 18:37.849
It's Italian Tuesday?

18:37.851 --> 18:40.184
Did nobody bite the lunch lady?

18:40.186 --> 18:42.186

18:42.188 --> 18:43.588

18:47.327 --> 18:49.160
Phoebe, I'm not the vampire.

We can be best friends forever.

19:01.174 --> 19:02.507
Literally forever.

19:02.509 --> 19:04.208
- [audience laughter]

19:04.210 --> 19:05.343
- Cherry you'll be back
to normal

19:05.345 --> 19:06.377
as soon as I take care of Max.

19:06.379 --> 19:07.879

19:18.758 --> 19:20.391

19:20.393 --> 19:23.461
They're no match
for my real swords.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.831
- [audience laughter]
- An umbrella, really?

19:26.833 --> 19:29.534
Did nobody bite
the fencing club?

I liked being a vampire.

20:32.932 --> 20:35.633
I was this close to learning
how to become a bat.

You're the head vampire,
they should all be human by now.

20:43.276 --> 20:45.977

is the bunny spit on my neck.

21:06.599 --> 21:07.898

21:14.641 --> 21:18.442
I have one more thing that
will definitely scare you.
