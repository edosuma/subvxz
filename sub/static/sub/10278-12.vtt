E. R.

00:05.996 --> 00:07.202
Previously on E. R.

00:07.203 --> 00:09.201
I feel terrible about what's happened.

00:09.202 --> 00:12.509
Which part? Me being crippled
or you getting sued for malpractice?

00:12.510 --> 00:15.710
I took some Vicodin out of a patient's
prescription bottle and I swallowed them.

00:15.711 --> 00:18.922
- Did you successfully expel them?
- Yes.

00:18.957 --> 00:21.841
- You coming back to work soon?
- Next week, I hope.

00:21.842 --> 00:23.778
I heard you were doing
immune therapy.

00:23.979 --> 00:25.806
As soon as the tumor vaccine's ready.

00:25.807 --> 00:27.518
I'm sorry. I can't stay.

00:27.819 --> 00:30.206
- I'll send in a surgical resident.
- Where do you think you are going?

00:30.207 --> 00:32.858
- I'm sorry.
- Get your ass over here now!

00:32.859 --> 00:36.821
Look, I know that it's been tense between us
and I really don't mean it to be.

00:36.822 --> 00:39.917
In a few weeks we'll just be
friendly co-workers all over again.

00:39.918 --> 00:41.879
I'm not sure that's what I want.

E. R. 7x12 "SURRENDER"

01:05.375 --> 01:09.325
Kerry, I'm gonna put a fresh towel
on the sink for you.

01:09.505 --> 01:11.877
Okay, thank you.

01:12.049 --> 01:14.541
What time does your shift start?

01:15.262 --> 01:16.804
- Nine.
- Oh.

01:16.972 --> 01:20.887
You better hurry up.
Do you want some coffee?

01:21.394 --> 01:24.063
- Sure. Thanks.
- Okay.

01:39.164 --> 01:40.789
- That looks good on you.
- What?

01:40.958 --> 01:45.336
- My blouse.
- Oh, yeah. It's not too long?

01:45.672 --> 01:47.250
No.

01:52.972 --> 01:55.464
Good thing I have
a 40-gallon water heater.

01:55.642 --> 01:57.599
- What?
- You take long showers.

01:58.061 --> 02:00.387
- I'm sorry.
- No. No. So do I.

02:00.564 --> 02:04.978
Sometimes I stand under there for 20
minutes just to wake up when it's cold.

02:05.654 --> 02:07.397
Especially in winter.

02:08.365 --> 02:10.322
- Is it cold outside?
- Low 20s. Want a bagel?

02:10.491 --> 02:13.944
No, thanks.
I'll get something at work.

02:15.623 --> 02:17.782
- You okay?
- Yeah, I got it.

02:17.959 --> 02:22.207
No, I meant about us.
The first time can be a little...

02:24.050 --> 02:27.716
No. It's just... It's just different.

02:28.305 --> 02:29.965
That's true.

02:30.724 --> 02:31.970
- But good.
- Really?

02:32.143 --> 02:33.721
Yeah.

02:34.812 --> 02:37.648
- I'll see you at work.
- Yeah.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.406
I'll see you later.

02:50.998 --> 02:54.498
I'm sorry, I know this is understood,
but I just...

02:54.669 --> 02:57.374
This is just gonna be
between us, right?

02:57.547 --> 02:59.291
Of course.

03:02.720 --> 03:04.345
I'll get the door.

03:11.605 --> 03:15.306
Open a GAl-50 and
a TA-55 on the resection.

03:15.485 --> 03:17.644
- No need. I gave it to Henderson.
- What?

03:17.821 --> 03:20.692
Page us if the CAT scan shows free air.
Let's go.

03:20.866 --> 03:22.491
- Where?
- I got a chore for you.

03:22.660 --> 03:26.160
- You know what? I'm a little busy.
- So am I. Let's go.

03:26.956 --> 03:31.085
How is this per diem situation
working out for you?

03:31.253 --> 03:33.211
- Could be better.
- What's the problem?

03:33.381 --> 03:36.050
- Where are we going?
- Are you dissatisfied in some way?

03:36.217 --> 03:38.376
Besides being grossly underpaid?

03:38.553 --> 03:41.887
Would a $10,000 raise
and a benefits package help?

03:42.057 --> 03:44.216
- What?
- Let's make it 20,000...

03:44.393 --> 03:48.059
- ...with some administrative work.
- You're serious?

03:48.231 --> 03:51.233
Yeah. You've been doing your penance.
Working hard...

03:51.402 --> 03:55.566
...displaying dedication and groveling.
I'd be a sadist if I didn't ease up.

03:55.740 --> 03:59.240
- What do I have to do?
- Oh, a little of this, a little of that.

03:59.411 --> 04:01.368
What's in it for you?

04:02.248 --> 04:04.739
- Forget it. Go back to Surgery.
- I'm just asking.

04:04.917 --> 04:06.994
Do you want the bump
or don't you?

04:09.965 --> 04:12.254
- Sure.
- So we have a deal?

04:12.927 --> 04:13.958
Yeah.

04:15.930 --> 04:19.264
Okay. Let's go. This way, please.

04:22.605 --> 04:28.311
Sorry for the delay. Dr. Benton had to
finish a surgery on a gunshot wound.

04:28.486 --> 04:31.773
Come on in, Peter. Don't be shy.
Come on. Come on.

04:34.452 --> 04:39.280
We at the county level are concerned
about the declining numbers...

04:39.458 --> 04:44.535
...of minority medical school students
and faculty physicians.

04:44.714 --> 04:48.582
We are committed to addressing
this issue. As part of that commitment...

04:48.760 --> 04:53.553
...I am appointing a Director of Diversity
for the medical center: Dr. Peter Benton.

04:55.476 --> 05:01.298
Dr. Benton's bio can be found in
your handout materials. He's all yours.

05:01.775 --> 05:06.319
Is your appointment the direct result of the
Trip's investigative report about the...

05:06.489 --> 05:09.159
...declining numbers
of African-Americans...

05:09.326 --> 05:11.782
...being admitted to med school?

05:18.378 --> 05:20.252
I...

05:21.381 --> 05:23.458
I mean, you know...

05:24.385 --> 05:25.844
It could be a part of it.

05:26.604 --> 05:29.518
How can you ensure minority representation
at the medical school...

05:29.553 --> 05:32.676
...in this post-affirmative action era?

05:41.488 --> 05:44.490
E. R.

06:24.668 --> 06:27.872
- Is he drinking?
- Just water. He had a little rice.

06:28.215 --> 06:31.834
- Did you start an IV?
- We can't without a court order.

06:32.011 --> 06:35.013
- Call Dr. Samson.
- Dr. Samson doesn't work here anymore.

06:35.182 --> 06:37.934
- What?
- Dr. Miller treats your cousin now.

06:38.102 --> 06:41.354
- Fine. Call him.
- Probably not necessary now you're here.

06:41.524 --> 06:44.395
- Why's that?
- I think he's just lonely.

06:46.154 --> 06:50.106
Can you get me a protein shake
or something?

06:52.830 --> 06:54.409
Hey, Chase.

06:55.375 --> 06:56.953
It's John.

07:00.466 --> 07:02.459
Mind if I sit down?

07:05.847 --> 07:10.345
Hey, I'm sorry that I haven't
been around here very much.

07:11.897 --> 07:13.725
I've been busy.

07:14.317 --> 07:16.310
For a year?

07:16.904 --> 07:18.315
You're right.

07:18.864 --> 07:21.439
You're right. That's not an excuse.

07:22.244 --> 07:24.736
Hey, your speech sounds good.

07:25.414 --> 07:28.583
You been getting around much?

07:28.753 --> 07:30.295
No.

07:33.134 --> 07:34.877
Here you go.

07:37.180 --> 07:40.017
You gotta eat something, Chase.

07:40.769 --> 07:43.390
- No.
- Why not? What's the matter?

07:45.065 --> 07:46.561
- Just take a sip.
- No.

07:46.735 --> 07:48.562
- Just take a little sip.
- No!

07:52.618 --> 07:56.034
- Maybe later.
- Go away.

08:01.880 --> 08:03.837
- Let me know if this hurts.
- Hell, yes.

08:04.007 --> 08:06.760
- Wuss.
- You want another beating, keep talking.

08:06.928 --> 08:09.930
- I'm sitting right here.
- This is his sparring partner, Walter.

08:10.098 --> 08:13.599
- Lip lac and a possible broken jaw.
- Aren't you too old to be fighting?

08:13.770 --> 08:16.226
Never too old to defend a lady's honor.

08:16.315 --> 08:17.858
This was over a woman?

08:18.026 --> 08:19.818
Grace is in all her steps

08:19.987 --> 08:24.069
Beauty in her eyes
In every gesture, dignity and love

08:24.243 --> 08:27.826
- He stole that from a book.
- At least I know how to read.

08:27.997 --> 08:30.323
- Yeah. With your lips moving.
- Lip?

08:30.501 --> 08:31.782
Okay, okay.

08:31.961 --> 08:36.754
Let's start with 6-0 nylon. Let's try
and keep these kids apart, shall we?

08:36.926 --> 08:38.669
Hey, Mark.

08:38.845 --> 08:40.672
- Morning, Kerry.
- How's it going?

08:40.847 --> 08:45.179
Snow blower blew a rock into
a guy's larynx. I had to trache him.

08:45.354 --> 08:48.854
- No. I meant with you. First day back.
- So far, so good.

08:49.025 --> 08:52.193
- I'll let you know in four hours.
- We getting a little backed up?

08:52.363 --> 08:55.530
- Three patients waiting for a consult.
- Who's on the service?

08:55.700 --> 08:58.537
Peter. But she's stuck
in a press conference.

08:58.705 --> 09:01.161
- Who?
- Peter. She's been in for an hour.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.327
- Who's "she"?
- What?

09:03.503 --> 09:08.379
- Who's giving a press conference?
- I don't know. But I heard Peter's in it.

09:08.550 --> 09:10.094
- Kerry?
- Yeah.

09:10.262 --> 09:14.343
Can you call Radiology? They sent
this guy back without his films.

09:14.517 --> 09:18.647
- Is there any bone exposed?
- I have to rongeur it. I need the x-ray.

09:18.814 --> 09:21.021
- How'd it happen?
- They just lost it.

09:21.192 --> 09:24.278
- No. The finger.
- I don't know. He won't say.

09:26.950 --> 09:28.825
Chuny already tried.

09:32.332 --> 09:34.574
Looks like some kind of saw.

09:38.132 --> 09:39.756
What did he say?

09:43.681 --> 09:44.712
I told you.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.509
- Someone bring him in?
- He took a cab.

09:47.685 --> 09:49.763
What cab company?

09:50.732 --> 09:53.484
- Nobody saw him arrive?
- Malik was out there. Why?

09:53.652 --> 09:56.773
- We should put a call in to OSHA.
- OSHA?

09:56.948 --> 10:00.697
They monitor workplace safety
requirements. He's probably illegal...

10:00.870 --> 10:03.576
...and not saying anything
because he doesn't wanna lose his job.

10:03.749 --> 10:06.999
- That's his choice, isn't it?
- Until someone gets seriously hurt.

10:07.170 --> 10:10.587
- I'll find out.
- I just need you to call Radiology.

10:10.758 --> 10:13.796
- What are you crying about?
- You should have talked to me first.

10:13.971 --> 10:17.222
I did. I said a little extra money
for added responsibility.

10:17.392 --> 10:19.717
- I don't like being used.
- Everyone is used.

10:19.895 --> 10:23.811
- It's what makes the world go round.
- You gave me that job because I'm black.

10:23.984 --> 10:27.271
You're discounting your
finely honed public relations skills.

10:27.447 --> 10:29.440
- I don't want it.
- Sure you do.

10:29.616 --> 10:32.368
You should have thought of that
before your press conference.

10:32.536 --> 10:36.238
I need a minority to be the director.
But it won't require any real work.

10:36.417 --> 10:39.834
It'll get you that much closer
to a full-time faculty position.

10:40.005 --> 10:43.042
You can find somebody else
to be your poster boy.

10:43.217 --> 10:45.971
Well, the truth is I don't have
anyone else.

10:46.138 --> 10:49.389
Which is why the diversity issue
needs your immediate attention.

10:49.684 --> 10:52.390
- You don't even believe that.
- Actually, I do.

10:52.981 --> 10:56.682
But it doesn't really matter, does it?
It's on your shoulders now. Excuse me.

10:56.860 --> 10:58.854
Time's up, Peter.

11:00.032 --> 11:02.155
- Did I misread the schedule?
- What schedule?

11:02.326 --> 11:04.533
You canceled six cases
in the past week.

11:04.704 --> 11:06.532
No, they were rescheduled.

11:06.749 --> 11:09.916
- Which means canceled.
- One had a fever, one had an emergency.

11:10.086 --> 11:13.338
All of them happen to be
the more complex procedures.

11:13.508 --> 11:18.136
It's simple coincidence. Look, I've been
completely slammed by this review.

11:18.306 --> 11:22.600
- Nothing seems to be up to standard.
- I have every confidence in you.

11:22.769 --> 11:25.891
But I need an associate chief
who actually performs surgery.

11:26.066 --> 11:27.858
I do.

11:28.027 --> 11:30.435
I will. Once I get out
from under all of this.

11:30.613 --> 11:34.280
- No, today. You're covering the ER.
- Robert, they're coming on Monday.

11:34.452 --> 11:36.658
You only have to go there
if they page you.

11:39.834 --> 11:42.242
- Are you married?
- No.

11:42.420 --> 11:46.206
- Oh, a cute girl like yourself?
- Well, he didn't crack your skull.

11:46.384 --> 11:47.582
What?

11:47.761 --> 11:50.169
There's no blood.
He didn't crack your skull.

11:50.347 --> 11:53.931
He couldn't crack a smile.
I'm a big proponent of marriage.

11:54.103 --> 11:56.939
Of course, you gotta be married
to the right person.

11:57.107 --> 12:00.690
- Is that a proposal?
- We have to get to know each other first.

12:00.861 --> 12:04.943
We have to wait for the x-ray. I don't see
any other injuries. Anything else hurt?

12:05.117 --> 12:07.953
Nothing I want to talk about
in mixed company.

12:08.121 --> 12:09.152
Well, I'm a nurse.

12:09.331 --> 12:12.286
If I'm gonna talk to you
about my private parts...

12:12.460 --> 12:15.830
...I'd prefer to do it in a social setting.

12:16.341 --> 12:19.508
- Does it hurt when you pee?
- Yeah. How did you know?

12:19.678 --> 12:23.464
- Do you have an enlarged prostate?
- It's large enough.

12:23.642 --> 12:27.142
Well, it could be prostatitis.
I'm gonna need a urine sample.

12:27.313 --> 12:29.770
You'll have to hold it a little lower.

12:29.942 --> 12:32.647
I am going to show you
to the bathroom.

12:32.820 --> 12:36.321
Actually, it feels more like something
you pick up.

12:36.492 --> 12:39.328
- Pick up?
- A burning. I got it once before...

12:39.496 --> 12:41.868
...when I was stationed in Korea.

12:42.041 --> 12:43.702
From sex?

12:44.127 --> 12:46.619
Well, I didn't get it from dancing.

12:46.922 --> 12:51.135
Abby, we need you. Grab 100
of mannitol. Gunshot wound to the head.

12:51.303 --> 12:55.137
- I'll be right back. Pee in that.
- From here?

12:56.477 --> 12:58.849
- Asystolic after two liters.
- What do you want?

12:59.021 --> 13:02.143
Full trauma panel. Get a C-spine.
Cross him for four.

13:02.318 --> 13:04.477
On my count. One, two, three.

13:04.654 --> 13:08.071
- Sinus at 65. Rate's coming down.
- What is it?

13:08.242 --> 13:11.327
15-year-old with self-inflicted
gunshot to the right temple.

13:11.496 --> 13:14.368
- Pupils are fixed and dilated.
- Was there a suicide note?

13:14.542 --> 13:16.998
No. His friend said
they were playing Russian roulette.

13:17.171 --> 13:20.374
Guy's behind us. Bullet blew
through this one and grazed his cheek.

13:20.549 --> 13:24.501
- No response to painful stimuli.
- I smell alcohol. He could just be drunk.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.387
Dropped his systolic to 70.
Bradying down to 50.

13:27.560 --> 13:31.344
- Open the fluids. Pump in O-neg.
- What are you doing?

13:31.523 --> 13:34.062
Massive blood loss.
Could be the cause of his low BP.

13:34.235 --> 13:36.442
Or he could have blown out
his brain stem.

13:36.613 --> 13:39.531
- Crit's 39.
- Doesn't sound like blood loss.

13:39.700 --> 13:43.035
- You want O-neg?
- But if you wanna try transfusing...

13:45.207 --> 13:48.126
Hang two units on the infuser.
I'll put in a central line.

13:48.671 --> 13:51.079
- What?
- Nothing.

13:51.757 --> 13:54.048
- Is this the other guy?
- Yeah.

13:54.637 --> 13:58.552
Superficial abrasion.
Left cheek, cranial nerves intact.

13:58.725 --> 14:00.885
- You were playing Russian roulette?
- What?

14:01.062 --> 14:04.266
- They were playing Russian roulette.
- It was his idea.

14:04.441 --> 14:06.102
- How old are you?
- Why?

14:06.277 --> 14:07.938
- How old?
- He wanted to play.

14:08.113 --> 14:09.857
- I got this.
- What, 20?

14:10.032 --> 14:11.657
- Nineteen.
- He's 15.

14:11.825 --> 14:15.576
- He's drunk. I could smell the alcohol.
- He came over that way.

14:15.748 --> 14:17.622
- You didn't give her anything?
- Who?

14:18.877 --> 14:21.583
- Your friend.
- He brought beer and his dad's gun.

14:21.756 --> 14:25.755
- You made him hold the gun to his head.
- No. Hell, I went first.

14:25.928 --> 14:28.805
- It was his idea, but you went first?
- Better odds.

14:28.836 --> 14:30.760
- Better odds?
- That's the point.

14:30.834 --> 14:34.933
- It's not a game! She blew his brains out!
- Who's "she"?

14:35.107 --> 14:36.601
- What?
- You said she.

14:36.775 --> 14:38.271
He! He's dead.

14:38.737 --> 14:41.822
He loaded the bullet.
He knew what could happen.

14:42.449 --> 14:45.452
Why aren't the police
arresting this idiot?

14:45.621 --> 14:48.955
- I didn't kill him.
- The hell you didn't.

14:54.692 --> 14:58.194
- Did you call it?
- Yeah. After 45 minutes of CPR.

14:58.365 --> 15:00.986
- I should never have started.
- You wanted to make sure.

15:01.160 --> 15:03.570
You would have called it
from the beginning.

15:03.748 --> 15:06.952
- Yeah. But I'm lazy.
- Mark, please.

15:07.127 --> 15:10.249
You wanted to give it a chance.
No big failure.

15:10.758 --> 15:12.918
- I'm going back upstairs.
- Later, gator.

15:13.095 --> 15:16.596
- Hey, are you taking it easy?
- Yes, Mom.

15:16.851 --> 15:20.850
It came back from the
dry cleaners like that. Smell it.

15:22.525 --> 15:26.062
- So anyway, he's not psychotic?
- No. Sociopathic, maybe.

15:26.239 --> 15:29.195
I can't hold him.
We'll leave it up to the police.

15:29.370 --> 15:31.862
- Thanks.
- Anytime.

15:33.209 --> 15:35.416
- So, Elizabeth?
- Yeah?

15:35.587 --> 15:37.960
- Is Mark doing okay?
- Very well.

15:38.133 --> 15:42.596
- There's no change in personality or...?
- He's a little tired. Why?

15:42.765 --> 15:45.969
Have you noticed that
he's mixing his pronouns?

15:46.145 --> 15:47.473
Mixing? How?

15:47.688 --> 15:49.813
Like saying she
when he means he.

15:52.028 --> 15:54.817
No. Has he said anything
to you about it?

15:54.991 --> 15:57.863
- I don't think he realizes.
- Maybe you've misheard.

15:58.037 --> 15:59.996
Yeah. Maybe.

16:00.166 --> 16:03.668
- Dr. Weaver. Starting my shift.
- Okay.

16:03.839 --> 16:07.006
You wanted to see me
before I started my shift.

16:08.722 --> 16:12.934
I've been thinking about it.
The fact that you claimed responsibility...

16:13.102 --> 16:17.184
...I think is a positive sign.
Therefore, I feel that I can't...

16:17.359 --> 16:20.527
...summarily dismiss you.

16:20.697 --> 16:23.985
- But?
- What chip are you up to? Your AA chip.

16:24.161 --> 16:27.198
- How many days of sobriety?
- Two hundred and forty.

16:27.374 --> 16:28.454
Give it to me.

16:29.920 --> 16:32.043
It's- It's at home.

16:33.090 --> 16:35.714
All right. Well, you're starting over.

16:35.887 --> 16:40.885
Another 90 days, another 90 meetings.
And I need documentation.

16:41.062 --> 16:46.818
You'll go back to not administering any
narcotics or benzos until further notice.

16:46.987 --> 16:51.568
But that's it. Even the smallest
infraction and you no longer work here.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.904
- Understood. Thank you.
- Good.

16:54.081 --> 16:56.704
Don't make me regret it, John.

17:01.926 --> 17:05.925
- How are you doing, Mr. Nicolaides?
- Call me Walter.

17:06.099 --> 17:08.852
I'd be doing a lot better
with a sponge bath.

17:09.020 --> 17:11.180
- You want a bath?
- Yes, please.

17:14.028 --> 17:15.522
Malik.

17:16.115 --> 17:17.942
Yeah. What?

17:18.117 --> 17:22.746
- Oh, no. I'm fine. I was just kidding.
- Never mind.

17:22.915 --> 17:24.577
Whatever.

17:26.255 --> 17:30.753
- You're a real firecracker, aren't you?
- That's me. Nurse Firecracker.

17:30.929 --> 17:32.472
- Married?
- None of your business.

17:33.266 --> 17:38.143
My second wife was a spinster.
Married her when she was 32.

17:38.314 --> 17:41.899
- Waiting for the right guy, I guess.
- Damn right.

17:42.071 --> 17:45.322
We were married for another 32 years
before she passed.

17:45.492 --> 17:49.539
But don't worry, because feisty gals
like you always take a little longer.

17:49.706 --> 17:52.164
I wasn't the one who
was brought in for fighting.

17:52.336 --> 17:56.336
Well, Earl started that.
He was flirting with my Victoria.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.218
- Who's Victoria?
- My lady friend.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.515
Are the two of you intimate?

18:03.019 --> 18:07.268
I still get up a full head of steam,
if that's what you're driving at.

18:07.985 --> 18:11.023
I see. Tell me, Walter...

18:11.199 --> 18:13.869
...have you been experiencing
any burning when you pee?

18:16.079 --> 18:21.588
It was cool at first. Then my girlfriend
went to work and it stayed like that.

18:21.756 --> 18:24.877
- Have you taken any drugs lately, Gary?
- A little coke.

18:25.052 --> 18:28.589
Okay, that'll do it.
Have you tried masturbating?

18:28.766 --> 18:31.056
No. I'm a Christian.

18:31.228 --> 18:35.179
Well, too bad. Sometimes that helps.

18:35.359 --> 18:38.279
- Guess we'll have to drain it.
- How?

18:38.448 --> 18:40.441
With a needle.

18:41.828 --> 18:45.163
- Do you have a men's room around?
- Down the hall to the left.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.661
I'll check back.

18:46.836 --> 18:48.829
- How do you know she's gay?
- It's obvious.

18:49.005 --> 18:52.423
- Are the fibroids actively bleeding?
- Crit is down to 28.

18:52.594 --> 18:55.549
Why risk transfusions
if she's not going to use it anyway?

18:55.724 --> 18:56.922
- Use what?
- Her uterus.

18:57.102 --> 18:59.640
- Oh, come on!
- You can tell. Check her out.

18:59.813 --> 19:03.648
These files, Dr. Benton's. He doesn't
have a box anymore so they came back.

19:03.820 --> 19:07.486
- It doesn't ensure they won't come back.
- A hysterectomy is the safest way.

19:07.658 --> 19:08.988
Dr. Weaver?

19:10.496 --> 19:11.575
Lounge.

19:11.748 --> 19:13.291
I'll make sure
she understands the risks.

19:13.459 --> 19:17.542
- Be careful. I don't want a lawsuit.
- I'm the king of couth, chief.

19:17.716 --> 19:19.839
Great. Storm's back. It's snowing again.

19:20.010 --> 19:22.967
- Is this my hand x-ray?
- Does it have your name on it?

19:23.141 --> 19:24.932
- Yes.
- Then it's yours.

19:25.101 --> 19:27.308
Orbie Coronado from OSHA
called back.

19:27.479 --> 19:30.732
Said someone from the INS
may be calling.

19:30.902 --> 19:34.070
- I didn't want them to call the INS.
- Is that my patient?

19:34.240 --> 19:37.825
They've been having problems
with furniture sweatshops in that area.

19:37.996 --> 19:41.201
- Call them back.
- That's great.

19:41.376 --> 19:44.332
We have to report
unsafe working conditions.

19:44.506 --> 19:47.211
- He wouldn't even say how he cut it.
- He was scared.

19:47.385 --> 19:49.925
- Scared of getting deported.
- Nobody's getting deported.

19:50.974 --> 19:53.727
Why the hell not?
If he's illegal, he's illegal.

19:53.896 --> 19:56.019
Shut up, Frank.

19:58.151 --> 20:00.823
Hey, I heard you got stuck
with grumpy old men.

20:01.365 --> 20:04.700
- Horny old men. They have chlamydia.
- How old are they?

20:04.870 --> 20:07.623
Late 70s. It seems to be
going around their nursing home.

20:07.791 --> 20:09.999
There's more than shuffleboard
in our futures.

20:10.170 --> 20:13.588
Do you want Mr. Baker,
20-year-old sickler in crisis?

20:13.759 --> 20:15.420
- Better not.
- Why not?

20:15.595 --> 20:18.800
Because I'm back to
not pushing narcotics.

20:19.100 --> 20:20.975
- You told Weaver?
- Yeah.

20:21.145 --> 20:24.397
- She was okay?
- Not okay. But she let me stay...

20:24.567 --> 20:27.771
- ... with a few reinforced restrictions.
- Good for you.

20:27.947 --> 20:29.193
- I guess.
- I mean it.

20:29.366 --> 20:30.860
Thanks for the push.

20:31.034 --> 20:33.741
- Carter, wound check in 5 has-
- I'm coming.

20:33.915 --> 20:35.575
He's getting difficult.

20:35.750 --> 20:39.453
Both EKGs are normal.
Cardiac enzymes are normal.

20:39.632 --> 20:43.926
His cardiologist said he should have
a treadmill test and an angiogram.

20:44.096 --> 20:46.671
- Probably meant as an outpatient.
- He didn't say that.

20:46.851 --> 20:48.345
That's what he meant.

20:48.769 --> 20:52.271
Keep taking your medications
and come back if there are any problems.

20:52.442 --> 20:53.688
That's it?

20:53.861 --> 20:57.314
- Make sure you see your cardiologist.
- You're not gonna admit him?

20:57.491 --> 20:59.486
- No.
- Georgia, it's all right.

20:59.662 --> 21:01.406
- Check him in.
- This isn't a hotel.

21:01.581 --> 21:05.451
We shouldn't have gone to a county
hospital. I want a second opinion.

21:06.005 --> 21:08.496
Okay. Here's your second opinion:

21:08.675 --> 21:13.968
Your husband's overweight.
He needs to stop drinking and smoking.

21:14.141 --> 21:17.393
He needs to lay off the pizza
and burgers and get some exercise.

21:17.563 --> 21:20.650
Otherwise, all the second opinions
in the world...

21:20.819 --> 21:24.022
...won't keep him from dropping dead
in the next two years.

21:28.538 --> 21:30.913
- I'll clear the Trauma Rooms.
- Notify the ICU.

21:31.794 --> 21:34.499
Get eight units of O-neg
and every bag of Ringer's.

21:34.672 --> 21:35.705
What's going on?

21:35.883 --> 21:39.669
Rescue's bringing in victims of a fire.
Smoke inhalation, crush injuries-

21:39.847 --> 21:41.675
- How many?
- I don't know.

21:41.850 --> 21:43.309
- You call the O.R.?
- Yeah.

21:43.478 --> 21:45.887
- ETA?
- They're rolling in.

21:47.275 --> 21:51.026
- I'll take the one on the end.
- Burn to the right arm and face.

21:51.198 --> 21:52.230
What happened?

21:52.325 --> 21:54.697
A raid. A bunch of workers got trapped.

21:54.869 --> 21:58.870
Better keep her on O-2
and check carboxyhemoglobin level.

22:00.754 --> 22:04.623
Give. 5 of albuterol.
Mark, I thought you were off.

22:04.802 --> 22:06.879
- Not anymore.
- You need to take it easy.

22:07.055 --> 22:09.464
- Not much chance of that.
- Why don't you go triage?

22:09.643 --> 22:12.052
We'll flush out the joint upstairs.

22:12.313 --> 22:14.721
I threw her in the front seat
as I pulled out.

22:14.900 --> 22:19.232
- Any burns?
- It's a superficial lac to the calf.

22:19.407 --> 22:23.242
- What's she saying?
- She's saying she wants her mom.

22:23.414 --> 22:26.451
Smoke inhalation with
pleuritic chest pain.

22:27.753 --> 22:30.874
- Malik, I need a blood gas on this guy.
- Portable chest?

22:30.951 --> 22:35.385
- Yeah. Get me a 12-lead.
- Got an INS officer with a crushed pelvis.

22:35.557 --> 22:37.966
- Any shortness of breath?
- Did they get out?

22:38.144 --> 22:41.145
We only got half of them out.
They had the place barred shut.

22:41.314 --> 22:44.437
- What place?
- We got a tip on an illegal sweatshop.

22:44.612 --> 22:47.449
- We went there and it started burning.
- Sats are down to 82.

22:48.452 --> 22:51.122
Dr. Weaver, his pulse ox is falling.

22:51.288 --> 22:56.998
Put him on 15 liters. Open an intubation
tray. He needs a trauma consult now.

23:00.802 --> 23:02.465
Sorry, doc.

23:06.853 --> 23:12.017
Decreased breath sounds on the left.
Carter, can you take this?

23:12.196 --> 23:13.905
- Yeah. Trauma 2.
- Luka?

23:14.074 --> 23:18.868
30-year-old male, burns over most
of his body. BP, 100/70. Pulse, 120.

23:19.039 --> 23:21.496
- Where should we go?
- Get him out of the hallway.

23:21.668 --> 23:24.374
- How much fluid in?
- One liter Ringer's and 10 of morphine.

23:24.547 --> 23:27.883
Okay, give another round of both.
I need a sterile gown and gloves.

23:32.225 --> 23:33.887
You know each other?

23:35.606 --> 23:37.314
They work together.

23:38.986 --> 23:40.066
Mark.

23:40.238 --> 23:43.110
- Mark! What's open?
- Try the Suture Room.

23:43.285 --> 23:46.121
- Suture Room. Go!
- He needs an NG tube and a Foley.

23:46.289 --> 23:49.790
- We're out of I&D kits.
- Use suture-removal kits for débriding.

23:49.961 --> 23:52.500
CBC, chem panel and cardiac enzymes.

23:53.550 --> 23:57.596
Possible burns. She may have touched
a power line while helping her daughter.

24:00.060 --> 24:02.053
- She doesn't know what happened.
- How old?

24:02.229 --> 24:03.725
Five. First name, Araceli.

24:03.899 --> 24:08.694
Haleh, call Dispatch. See if they have
a 20 on a 5-year-old girl.

24:08.865 --> 24:12.651
Good air entry, scattered rales
bilaterally. Put her on a pulse ox.

24:12.829 --> 24:15.452
- Got an exit wound here.
- Here's the entry.

24:15.625 --> 24:18.332
- She's burned from the inside out.
- What was the voltage?

24:18.505 --> 24:20.997
- I don't know.
- Get on the phone and find out.

24:21.175 --> 24:23.928
- Pulse ox, 89.
- Put him up to five liters.

24:25.307 --> 24:29.140
Take it easy. Just lay back.
Just lay back.

24:29.312 --> 24:33.098
- Titrate another 10 of morphine.
- Twenty percent partial-thickness burns.

24:33.987 --> 24:35.315
He needs a chest tube.

24:35.488 --> 24:37.862
- I need to prep for an escharotomy.
- That's not good.

24:38.034 --> 24:40.989
Can you set up a fiber-optic
laryngoscope? I need it now!

24:41.164 --> 24:43.737
I got it!
Carter, can you help me prep the chest?

24:43.918 --> 24:46.624
- I'm losing pulses.
- How fast do you need the fluids?

24:46.797 --> 24:49.883
I'm estimating 92 percent surface burns.

24:49.968 --> 24:52.675
Start Ringer's at 1700 cc's per hour.

24:52.848 --> 24:54.509
Setting at 91 on 15 liters.

24:54.726 --> 24:56.885
Switch to humidified O-2,
non-rebreather.

24:59.525 --> 25:02.195
- What?
- He's asking how bad it is.

25:02.362 --> 25:04.571
Tell him very serious.

25:06.243 --> 25:08.201
Am I going to die?

25:08.371 --> 25:10.366
Most likely, yes.

25:11.668 --> 25:15.584
- Finger's swollen. I can't get his ring off.
- Get the ring cutter.

25:16.049 --> 25:19.052
- I'm in.
- No pneumo, good tube position.

25:19.221 --> 25:21.760
- He's still hypotensive.
- You know how it started?

25:21.933 --> 25:25.139
Paint thinner. Someone kicked over
a heater when they ran out.

25:25.314 --> 25:27.023
- Where's that crit?
- Working on it.

25:27.191 --> 25:30.148
Borderline widened mediastinum
and a left pleural effusion.

25:30.322 --> 25:31.651
Might be his aorta.

25:32.616 --> 25:36.451
- All right. Chest CT. Let's move him.
- Hold on. Crit's low at 31.

25:38.459 --> 25:40.785
You want to take him up to the O.R.?

25:40.962 --> 25:44.380
No, I don't want to open him.
It could just be an intercostal artery.

25:46.930 --> 25:51.429
Fine. We'll do a transesophageal echo.
Somebody tell them we're on our way.

25:51.604 --> 25:55.057
- Neck is swollen.
- So are the upper extremities.

25:55.235 --> 25:58.106
- Where did you find her?
- She came in with Morales.

25:58.280 --> 26:02.447
- Her sats are dropping, 86.
- Put her on high-flow O-2, open saline.

26:02.621 --> 26:06.620
High voltage fried every cell
in its path. Her CK is over 2000.

26:10.967 --> 26:14.253
- Did you check her out?
- A non-displaced fracture of the tibia.

26:19.687 --> 26:21.766
- She's okay.
- Pulse ox dropping, 82.

26:21.942 --> 26:24.777
Let's intubate. Abby, take her out.

26:25.446 --> 26:29.446
- Abby, out.
- She wants you to take care of her.

26:30.579 --> 26:33.997
Twenty of etomidate, 100 of sux.

26:36.631 --> 26:38.670
8-0 ET tube.

26:40.553 --> 26:42.013
Relax, relax, relax.

26:44.016 --> 26:46.343
Okay, okay. Carter, hold him down.

26:47.147 --> 26:49.056
Hold on. Watch the drape!

26:49.691 --> 26:52.018
Sats are down to 78.
He's getting hypoxic.

26:52.195 --> 26:54.735
- All right, push some Versed.
- What?

26:54.908 --> 26:57.198
- The Versed! Right there! Come on!
- I can't.

26:57.370 --> 26:58.533
- Why?
- I'm not allowed to.

26:58.705 --> 27:02.077
Push the damn Versed!
I got to get this tube in him!

27:03.671 --> 27:05.747
- Where are you going?!
- Hold on.

27:05.924 --> 27:08.761
- Inflate the tube. Bag her.
- Her complexes are widening.

27:08.929 --> 27:10.969
- Dave, go help Benton.
- I'm busy.

27:11.140 --> 27:13.978
- Sats are still dropping.
- I got this. Go ahead.

27:14.146 --> 27:17.433
- Give her 10 units of insulin and D50.
- Just do it, will you?

27:17.609 --> 27:18.891
- You do it.
- Dave, go.

27:19.070 --> 27:21.396
- What?
- Now. Help Benton.

27:21.573 --> 27:24.244
- You've got a run of six.
- Get a repeat potassium.

27:24.411 --> 27:27.082
- She's in V-tach.
- Crash cart! Charge to 200.

27:27.249 --> 27:31.200
- Got a weak femoral pulse.
- Get an amp of bicarb. Clear.

27:32.340 --> 27:36.884
- Still V-tach. Charging, 300.
- Pressure's 60 palp.

27:40.435 --> 27:43.188
Pressure's 92/62. Pulse, 110.

27:43.356 --> 27:44.982
Repeat crit is 28.

27:45.151 --> 27:48.522
- I can't isolate the aorta.
- You've got to go in now.

27:48.698 --> 27:50.857
Not blind, I don't.

27:51.034 --> 27:52.578
Come on.

27:53.205 --> 27:54.830
Come on.

27:55.958 --> 27:59.661
Okay. There. There's extra
lumenal fluid. He's torn his aorta.

27:59.840 --> 28:02.082
No kidding.

28:02.259 --> 28:06.473
Set up a thoracotomy tray.
Call the perfusionist. I'll scrub in.

28:06.641 --> 28:08.137
- Scrub fast.
- How much blood?

28:08.311 --> 28:11.646
- Eight more units. Type-specific.
- Clear.

28:12.358 --> 28:13.474
Still in V-tach.

28:13.653 --> 28:16.856
Three-sixty. 100 of lidocaine
and an amp of calcium.

28:17.032 --> 28:18.777
- Clear.
- What happened?

28:18.952 --> 28:22.820
- Lost the pulse.
- She's in V-fib. Let's start CPR.

28:22.999 --> 28:25.706
- Benton's taking your patient up.
- You get the chest tube in?

28:25.879 --> 28:28.585
- That's not all.
- Clear.

28:29.176 --> 28:33.887
- You had to intubate?
- Sats were low. I'm taking him to SICU.

28:34.058 --> 28:37.226
I'm sorry. I'm not allowed
to push controlled substances.

28:37.396 --> 28:39.936
- He was about to arrest.
- It's part of my agreement.

28:40.109 --> 28:42.185
- You make exceptions.
- No exceptions.

28:42.362 --> 28:45.531
If you can't treat a patient,
you don't need to be in the room.

28:45.701 --> 28:48.275
- I didn't set the rules.
- Use your own judgment.

28:48.454 --> 28:52.537
- If I push the Versed, I'm outta here.
- How long has it been? Eight months?

28:52.711 --> 28:54.290
- Yeah.
- I'll talk to Weaver.

28:54.631 --> 28:57.004
- No, no. Don't.
- Dr. Benton, post-intubation film.

28:57.343 --> 29:00.050
I'll handle it.
It'll just piss her off anyway.

29:00.223 --> 29:03.759
You know what?
I'm pissed off. You should be pissed off.

29:03.937 --> 29:08.102
- Well, it's my problem.
- No, Carter. It's everybody's problem.

29:08.276 --> 29:10.769
Just don't talk to Weaver. Please.

29:11.532 --> 29:15.579
Swelling of the upper airway.
We'll intubate after the escharotomy.

29:22.882 --> 29:24.508
When is he going to die?

29:24.677 --> 29:27.882
In about a week, from infection.

29:29.476 --> 29:33.059
Your body won't be able to keep
the bacteria out.

29:34.651 --> 29:39.112
You'll also get major fluid imbalances
and possible kidney failure.

29:42.328 --> 29:46.114
We'll have to put a tube down
your throat to help you breathe.

29:53.052 --> 29:55.131
Can you find his wife?

29:55.307 --> 29:57.596
Does he have a number?

30:00.440 --> 30:02.065
No. She's-

30:02.234 --> 30:05.355
She's in Guatemala
and there's no phone there.

30:09.160 --> 30:12.531
He has $520 in a little box by his bed.

30:17.506 --> 30:21.376
He lives in a garage
at 395 Landale Street.

30:23.474 --> 30:25.513
Can you get it to her?

30:27.355 --> 30:29.977
Can you get her the money
and tell her what happened to him?

30:30.818 --> 30:31.850
Yeah.

30:36.953 --> 30:38.780
Can you tell her I love her?

30:41.335 --> 30:43.244
I love her very much.

30:46.927 --> 30:50.213
Okay, 30 of etomidate, six of Pavulon.

30:53.937 --> 30:55.217
Clear!

30:58.653 --> 31:01.489
- Fine V-fib.
- Charge again. 360.

31:01.907 --> 31:04.529
- Potassium is 7.5.
- Pulse ox is 60.

31:04.703 --> 31:07.077
- How long has she been down?
- Twenty-five minutes.

31:07.249 --> 31:08.280
Clear!

31:10.836 --> 31:12.748
Asystole.

31:13.758 --> 31:16.927
- How much atropine has she been given?
- Two amps.

31:17.097 --> 31:20.467
- When was the last epi?
- About three minutes ago.

31:25.735 --> 31:30.280
Okay, that's it.
Time of death, 12: 16.

31:30.451 --> 31:32.658
- There was too much internal injury.
- Yeah.

31:32.829 --> 31:37.375
Rescue found a guy trapped inside with
a blunt head trauma and blown pupil.

31:37.795 --> 31:40.797
- All right, let's go.
- I'll clear the room.

32:31.012 --> 32:34.132
I need better exposure.
Get a large Deaver in here.

32:34.307 --> 32:35.802
That is a large Deaver.

32:35.976 --> 32:38.301
Then give me more retraction.

32:38.478 --> 32:40.968
- I can't hold his pressure much longer.
- Metz.

32:41.147 --> 32:44.019
- We need a pump in O.R. 4.
- Where's the bypass machine?

32:44.193 --> 32:46.943
The first one will be
off the pump in 30 minutes.

32:47.111 --> 32:51.608
- I need it now.
- Right now. These are my last two units.

32:52.451 --> 32:54.159
DeBakey.

32:54.328 --> 32:56.784
Lisa, tell them we have
an unstable patient here.

32:56.956 --> 33:01.085
I did. The pump's not available for-
Now it's 29 minutes.

33:01.253 --> 33:05.250
Pressure's 80.
You've gotta cross-clamp him.

33:07.676 --> 33:11.009
If I do that, I'll cut off circulation
to his spinal cord.

33:11.179 --> 33:15.129
- Or you could let him bleed out.
- I will not paralyze this man.

33:15.309 --> 33:17.217
You want to kill him?

33:18.852 --> 33:21.689
I can't isolate the aorta.

33:24.777 --> 33:26.152
- Find Romano.
- We can't wait!

33:26.319 --> 33:28.811
Lisa, now! Go!

33:29.949 --> 33:35.110
Carter, I've got to go home. Girl in
Exam 1 needs a leg-burn débridement.

33:35.288 --> 33:37.197
Burn Unit's full. She need admission?

33:37.415 --> 33:39.537
No. Give him Thermazine
to use at home.

33:39.710 --> 33:41.203
- Boy or girl?
- What?

33:41.378 --> 33:43.868
- You said "him. "
- Carter, I'm really tired.

33:44.463 --> 33:47.999
- So much for a four-hour shift.
- See you Monday.

33:48.176 --> 33:50.050
- It's none of your business.
- It is.

33:50.220 --> 33:53.221
- He did what he was supposed to do.
- His sats were dropping.

33:53.390 --> 33:56.059
This one needs a tetanus booster
and dressing.

33:56.226 --> 33:58.633
There was a delay.
If I need an assistant-

33:58.812 --> 34:02.098
Peter, you are a surgical consultant!
You do not dictate ER policy!

34:02.274 --> 34:06.569
- This is not policy, this is punishment.
- We're not having this conversation.

34:06.737 --> 34:09.902
This one needs Xeroform
and a tube gauze dressing.

34:10.072 --> 34:12.315
- In a second.
- Fine.

34:12.493 --> 34:15.744
What do you have against him?
He made a mistake. He got through it.

34:15.914 --> 34:20.373
Peter, the terms of Carter's
diversion program are not your concern!

34:20.543 --> 34:23.746
It's time to let up.
He's been clean now for eight months.

34:23.920 --> 34:25.250
Has he?

34:28.426 --> 34:30.917
- Tenth unit's up.
- Proximal aorta is dissected.

34:31.094 --> 34:32.840
He's taching at 120.

34:33.014 --> 34:36.264
There's a traumatic pseudoaneurysm.
Where the hell is Romano?

34:36.435 --> 34:38.760
- I paged him three times.
- Checked his office?

34:38.938 --> 34:41.558
- And the staff lounge.
- Get the Resident on call.

34:41.732 --> 34:44.567
- The Resident?
- Yes! Just get him.

34:44.735 --> 34:49.063
- BP's 70 and dropping.
- Well, give him two more units.

34:49.239 --> 34:52.489
- This is all I've got.
- So call the blood bank.

34:52.659 --> 34:56.609
- They're out of A-positive. I told you.
- Then get O-negative!

34:56.789 --> 35:01.035
Just keep transfusing him.
Don't you understand I need more time?!

35:01.211 --> 35:04.165
You've got to cross-clamp him now.

35:05.047 --> 35:07.336
Do you want the Zanger
or the Crawford?

35:08.134 --> 35:09.926
Dr. Corday?

35:10.929 --> 35:13.799
Dr. Corday, what clamp?

35:17.312 --> 35:19.019
Dr. Corday?

35:23.234 --> 35:26.436
The Crawford. Crawford.

35:26.611 --> 35:30.775
We'll establish proximal control.
Open a 20mm Dacron.

35:31.158 --> 35:34.491
Okay. We'll maintain blood flow
to the spinal cord...

35:34.953 --> 35:38.288
...by sewing his intercostal arteries
into the graft.

35:38.458 --> 35:41.493
- BP's down to 60.
- Okay. The clamp's on.

35:41.835 --> 35:45.335
Dr. Babcock, I need another hematocrit.
Eleven blade.

35:47.175 --> 35:50.876
Okay. Pressure's up to 80.

35:51.054 --> 35:55.183
- Better work quick.
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

35:55.892 --> 36:01.231
Collateral flow should reduce
the risk of paralysis. Okay, cut.

36:01.398 --> 36:03.356
3-0 Prolene.

36:06.194 --> 36:07.689
Hey.

36:10.033 --> 36:15.786
Boy. Days like today, you look down
at your watch and your shift is over.

36:18.041 --> 36:19.618
What are those?

36:20.919 --> 36:24.786
- Med school applications.
- Oh, yeah? Where are you applying to?

36:28.385 --> 36:33.131
- Why the two separate stacks?
- Interviews. No interviews.

36:36.393 --> 36:38.884
You have a special secret formula?

36:39.313 --> 36:45.216
GPA times competitive factor plus MCAT
scores. Over 25, you get an interview.

36:45.903 --> 36:48.857
- You don't read recommendation letters?
- After the interview.

36:50.283 --> 36:52.026
Poor kids.

36:52.701 --> 36:56.071
I don't know if I would have made it
if I had the interview with you.

36:56.247 --> 36:57.954
How'd you get on the committee?

36:58.123 --> 36:59.951
I'm busy, Carter.

37:01.836 --> 37:04.292
- Did you talk to Weaver?
- Yep.

37:07.426 --> 37:11.209
It was nothing. It was a slip.
Not even a slip.

37:11.388 --> 37:13.880
You know? I threw them up.

37:18.436 --> 37:22.186
Urine output 75 in the last hour.
Hemoglobin's 10.8.

37:22.358 --> 37:25.644
Less than 100 cc's
of chest tube output.

37:25.820 --> 37:28.607
- Is that good?
- All good.

37:28.781 --> 37:31.735
I just need to do a quick neuro check.

37:32.369 --> 37:35.867
- For what?
- To check sensation.

37:41.586 --> 37:42.665
What's so funny?

37:42.837 --> 37:45.460
Let me see you wiggle your toes.

37:46.091 --> 37:48.877
- That's excellent.
- Lizzie, you called for me?

37:49.052 --> 37:53.430
- Yeah. Over an hour ago.
- I'm here now. What's so emergent?

37:53.599 --> 37:55.638
Will you excuse me?

37:59.062 --> 38:02.147
We had a little trouble
with an aortic graft...

38:02.316 --> 38:04.309
...and I wanted
a second pair of hands.

38:05.111 --> 38:06.771
Should I worry about a lawsuit?

38:07.529 --> 38:12.157
No. Things got hairy for a moment.
But I pulled him through.

38:13.161 --> 38:16.861
- Well, that's your job, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

38:17.041 --> 38:19.531
And I am now late for dinner.
Thank you, Elizabeth.

38:21.628 --> 38:23.122
Thank you.

38:35.392 --> 38:37.848
It's a good thing they didn't frisk me.

38:38.187 --> 38:40.060
It's chocolate.

38:41.607 --> 38:43.683
Go away.

38:46.112 --> 38:48.947
There's a reason I didn't come
to see you, Chase.

38:49.865 --> 38:52.867
I thought about coming.
But I didn't.

38:53.236 --> 38:59.223
And I didn't because I was afraid.
Because I didn't want to admit-

39:01.336 --> 39:06.332
When I got stabbed last year at work,
a friend of mine got killed. And I...

39:07.342 --> 39:11.590
...ended up addicted to painkillers.
And it caught up to me.

39:11.764 --> 39:15.132
And I started to shoot morphine...

39:15.309 --> 39:19.887
...and Demerol and fentanyl and
whatever else I could get my hands on.

39:20.063 --> 39:25.650
I don't know what would have happened
had I not got busted. I went to rehab.

39:27.071 --> 39:31.401
But I wasn't like any of those people.
I got into this because of an injury...

39:31.577 --> 39:35.408
...because of a near-death experience.
And they...

39:35.580 --> 39:39.708
Anyway, it wasn't me. I mean,
it was me, but it wasn't... Anyway.

39:39.876 --> 39:41.953
I did the program.

39:42.587 --> 39:47.796
I pretended that I bought into it.
I did everything I was supposed to do...

39:48.761 --> 39:50.552
...except...

39:51.095 --> 39:56.054
...believe that I had anything to do
with what had happened. And then...

39:56.978 --> 39:58.970
...I almost relapsed.

39:59.146 --> 40:02.646
Or I guess I-
I guess I did relapse. Anyway.

40:02.817 --> 40:08.756
I didn't come to see you because
I didn't want to admit to the fact...

40:09.032 --> 40:11.403
...that I was just like you.

40:15.956 --> 40:17.996
In fact, the truth is...

40:18.958 --> 40:22.625
...there's not a day that goes by
that I don't think about getting high.

40:23.630 --> 40:27.129
It's the first thing I think about
when I wake up in the morning.

40:27.635 --> 40:31.169
And it's the last thing I think about
when I go to bed at night.

40:31.804 --> 40:34.261
And I think about it all day.

40:43.860 --> 40:45.983
I'm a drug addict.

41:00.836 --> 41:03.671
Did you bring any french fries?

41:21.607 --> 41:24.562
Did the mom say anything
about relatives in Chicago?

41:24.861 --> 41:26.355
- No.
- How about in Guatemala?

41:26.529 --> 41:29.696
- We didn't have time to ask.
- All right, thanks.

41:30.200 --> 41:32.193
What's gonna happen to her?

41:33.035 --> 41:35.278
Put her in a group home for now.

41:37.040 --> 41:40.540
- Will she be deported?
- Not unless she's going back to family.

41:40.711 --> 41:42.833
Otherwise, she becomes a ward
of the state...

41:43.004 --> 41:45.840
...and then we look for
a Spanish-speaking foster home.

41:46.425 --> 41:48.714
- You okay?
- Yeah.
