He is not your friend,
he is the enemy.

00:05.495 --> 00:07.337
You let Don talk,
you should know better.

00:07.433 --> 00:08.849
The guy's not a salesman.

00:08.952 --> 00:11.332
- Why do we care what that guy wants?
- Because he's a client.

00:11.972 --> 00:13.365
I don't want to live on
the Upper East side.

00:13.463 --> 00:16.603
I saw us raising our kids in a place
with more different kinds of people.

00:18.306 --> 00:19.541
I don't know what to say.

00:19.649 --> 00:23.361
Say you're gonna be the first American
to complete a successful heart transplant.

00:23.770 --> 00:26.183
I could come up and
stay there tonight, if you want.

00:27.421 --> 00:28.764
We'll be fine.

Are you sure you don't want
me to order in some food?

- Chinese?
- I'm sorry this is taking so long.

01:17.743 --> 01:21.212
It's a common mistake
to not ask questions

01:21.246 --> 01:23.682
when you want something because
you're afraid of the answers.

01:23.716 --> 01:25.784
So you want something?

01:25.818 --> 01:27.385
I'm interested.

01:27.419 --> 01:31.288
And considering the precedent
for small agencies,

01:31.322 --> 01:33.724
this is how we might
take you public.

01:33.758 --> 01:37.227
With one and a half
million shares outstanding

01:37.261 --> 01:40.831
before the offering, we'd sell
400,000 additional shares

01:40.865 --> 01:42.967
to the public at $9 a share.

01:43.001 --> 01:45.903
- 12 a share.
- It's not an insult.

01:45.937 --> 01:48.771
Our valuation of your company was
made after careful analysis.

01:48.806 --> 01:50.539
Of papers you spent
20 minutes with?

01:50.574 --> 01:52.909
I can't take this
to the rest of my partners,

01:52.943 --> 01:55.444
but I can take it
to other underwriters.

01:56.780 --> 01:59.749
I'll need these documents
for 24 hours.

02:06.889 --> 02:09.657
These papers are spotless.
My compliments to the chef.

02:12.128 --> 02:13.662
Shall we?

02:23.171 --> 02:25.940
You don't think Cooper pushed that
poor banker too hard, do you?

02:25.974 --> 02:27.441
We don't want to lose him.

02:27.475 --> 02:29.543
Certainly not.

02:31.713 --> 02:33.480
It's a marvel.

02:33.515 --> 02:35.381
Everyone wants you, don't they?

02:35.415 --> 02:37.083
Pete, no.

02:37.118 --> 02:39.019
( chuckles )

02:39.053 --> 02:42.488
No, I believe our primary
hurdle has been cleared.

02:42.523 --> 02:44.257
And our secondary one?

02:44.291 --> 02:46.926
Don't worry about Don.
Even at nine a share,

02:46.961 --> 02:50.229
your part of the company alone
will be worth nearly $1 million.

02:53.232 --> 02:55.333
My goodness.

02:57.470 --> 02:59.171
You're flushed.

03:00.173 --> 03:02.641
I drank too fast.

03:02.676 --> 03:04.743
I don't think Don
cares about money.

03:04.778 --> 03:07.011
That may be true.
God bless him.

03:07.079 --> 03:09.280
But he's tired of playing
in the bush leagues.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.683
This capitalization
will double our size

03:11.684 --> 03:13.504
and that will turn his head.

03:15.688 --> 03:17.188
You want another?

03:17.222 --> 03:20.324
No. I can hardly walk
and you know it.

03:22.494 --> 03:24.995
I hope Clara reminded you
tomorrow's Mother's Day.

03:26.179 --> 03:27.783
Thank you, I'm aware.

03:38.215 --> 03:39.208
Ow.

03:39.242 --> 03:40.976
Just wanted to make sure
you were still here.

03:41.011 --> 03:43.179
I am, but not for long.

03:43.213 --> 03:45.280
You don't even know
what time it is.

03:46.817 --> 03:48.350
I do.

03:48.384 --> 03:51.220
Because I already got up
and put on my face.

03:51.254 --> 03:53.488
Is that what you do?

03:53.523 --> 03:56.091
- I wondered.
- I have to go.

03:58.227 --> 04:00.428
Daisy, you're a tease.

04:00.462 --> 04:03.331
What more could I give you?

04:03.365 --> 04:06.601
Look, the first-class lounge would
be a darker place without you,

04:06.635 --> 04:08.770
but you're supposed to have
your ear to the ground.

04:08.804 --> 04:12.206
I feel like you only call me
when you want to see me.

04:12.240 --> 04:14.775
Am I going to see you tomorrow?

04:14.809 --> 04:18.678
If there's a flight filled with P&G
executives headed back to Cincinnati.

04:18.713 --> 04:21.781
- How about tonight?
- I have plans.

04:21.815 --> 04:25.119
Some other boyfriend? The one
you give all the leads to?

04:28.789 --> 04:30.589
With my mother.

04:30.624 --> 04:32.024
It's Mother's Day.

04:32.059 --> 04:34.227
Don't go.

04:34.261 --> 04:37.163
I have to.

04:37.197 --> 04:39.031
But my mother just died.

05:10.729 --> 05:12.797
What are you doing?

05:14.466 --> 05:16.966
You told me you wanted
me here Sunday morning.

05:17.001 --> 05:18.769
I'm here.

05:20.305 --> 05:22.639
Peter, don't.

05:22.674 --> 05:25.175
( scoffs )

05:25.209 --> 05:28.244
So we'll just maintain every
other aspect of this marriage

05:28.279 --> 05:30.280
except the one that matters.

05:30.315 --> 05:32.247
You mean Tammy?

05:32.282 --> 05:35.384
Will you stop holding
the axe over my neck?

05:35.419 --> 05:39.188
So you'd rather I divorce you just
so you know where things stand?

05:39.222 --> 05:42.124
You don't care that I want you.

05:42.158 --> 05:44.993
I've taken note
of your efforts.

05:45.028 --> 05:46.929
I'm going to get her.

05:48.731 --> 05:50.865
Well...

05:50.899 --> 05:53.067
you're gonna be sorry
when this is over.

05:53.101 --> 05:55.370
You've given up on me
at exactly the wrong time.

05:55.404 --> 05:57.505
I have big things coming.

05:57.540 --> 05:59.708
You have no idea.

05:59.742 --> 06:01.676
Well, I'll take note
of that, too.

- Hi.

06:31.137 --> 06:33.339
I'm sorry to bother you.
Do you have any wrapping paper?

06:33.374 --> 06:35.640
It's an emergency.

06:35.675 --> 06:37.809
Good morning.

06:37.844 --> 06:40.579
Sorry, this is
Megan's mother Marie.

06:40.613 --> 06:43.715
We passed in the lobby.
I thought you were Megan.

06:43.750 --> 06:46.251
Dr. Arnold Rosen
at your service.

06:46.285 --> 06:48.653
- Enchant√©.
- <i>Are you French?</i>

06:48.688 --> 06:51.289
My kid's going to Paris.
Should I keep him home?

06:51.323 --> 06:54.124
I am French,
but I live in Montreal.

06:54.158 --> 06:56.260
And, yes, I believe so.

06:56.294 --> 06:58.128
I assume this isn't
a medical emergency.

Mitchell--
that's my son--

07:00.231 --> 07:02.400
he came home and surprised
her for Mother's Day.

07:02.434 --> 07:05.102
- How long is he staying?
- Who knows?

07:05.136 --> 07:07.670
I know he thinks a morning stroll
in Central Park is a gift,

07:07.705 --> 07:11.173
but Sylvia's gonna
expect an actual gift.

07:11.208 --> 07:14.444
Do you want my flowers?
I'm quite done with them.

07:14.478 --> 07:16.813
Thank you, Mother.

07:16.847 --> 07:19.749
You're a lifesaver.

07:24.020 --> 07:26.722
He's a surgeon. He's working
on heart transplants.

07:26.756 --> 07:30.426
Wealthy, talented,
handsome--

07:30.460 --> 07:32.628
I would not leave them alone.

07:32.662 --> 07:34.963
I'm more worried about you.

07:34.997 --> 07:36.598

07:37.934 --> 07:39.867
There's poop
on the stairs again.

07:39.902 --> 07:42.470
Somebody's dog got in.

07:42.504 --> 07:44.439
No, it's human.

07:44.473 --> 07:46.607
I think it's from the tenant.

07:46.642 --> 07:48.275
She wouldn't do that.

07:48.310 --> 07:49.844
She's a junkie.
She doesn't care.

07:49.878 --> 07:51.846
I want her out.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.881
We can't do that.

07:57.384 --> 07:59.018

08:00.287 --> 08:02.756

She wants to come visit.

08:02.790 --> 08:05.425
Ah!
Ow! Ow.

08:05.460 --> 08:07.126
Jesus.

08:07.161 --> 08:08.695
We have to hire a handyman.

08:08.729 --> 08:10.831
Why?
It's a waste of money.

08:10.865 --> 08:12.998
Because you have no idea
what you're doing.

08:13.032 --> 08:14.800
( sighs )

08:14.835 --> 08:18.971
( <i>"Linda Mulata" playing</i>

08:29.815 --> 08:32.851
Herb Rennet called. He's
canceling dinner tonight.

08:32.885 --> 08:34.652
That's a relief.

08:34.687 --> 08:36.120
We can still have dinner.

08:36.154 --> 08:37.589
I'd love to discuss
some things with you.

08:37.623 --> 08:39.756
Let's enjoy our reprieve.

08:39.792 --> 08:41.493
Of course.

08:42.928 --> 08:45.963
Psst.
Close the door.

08:48.366 --> 08:50.701
Did he say your dinner
with Jaguar is off?

08:50.735 --> 08:53.937
Yes, unless it was the
world's most boring dream.

08:53.972 --> 08:56.206
Well, it's on,
but Pete's not invited.

08:56.240 --> 08:59.075
Herb Rennet wants a word alone
to straighten things out.

08:59.110 --> 09:00.610
Why can't you handle it?

09:00.644 --> 09:03.078
This could be fatal.
You're going.

09:03.113 --> 09:06.148
And my plan is to pack it with
spouses to limit the explosion.

09:06.182 --> 09:07.683
Megan made plans
with her mother.

09:07.718 --> 09:09.018
She thought I had
a business dinner.

09:09.052 --> 09:11.453
Marie's in town?
Fantastic.

09:11.488 --> 09:14.023
Bring her along.
That's perfect.

09:14.057 --> 09:15.857
Tell her I insisted.

09:18.060 --> 09:20.361
In attendance
I have Jim Cutler,

09:20.396 --> 09:22.363
Frank Gleason, and Ted Chaough.

09:22.398 --> 09:24.733
Sweetheart, this is a creative meeting.
What are you doing?

09:24.767 --> 09:27.268
It's for the purposes
of the memorandum.

09:27.302 --> 09:30.805
Well, Ted, some men love
women, some love memos.

09:30.840 --> 09:33.306
I want to go over where we are
on Chevrolet again

09:33.341 --> 09:35.308
and devote our final days
to overdoing it

09:35.343 --> 09:37.144
on the artwork for
the top three campaigns.

09:37.178 --> 09:39.246
I cannot look at these again.

09:39.280 --> 09:41.415
I told you, they're very keen
on the rocket ship thing

09:41.449 --> 09:42.917
with the astronaut anecdotes.

09:42.951 --> 09:44.785
You told them
about the astronauts?

09:44.819 --> 09:47.387
I had to.
It was too vague otherwise.

09:47.422 --> 09:48.821
I don't want to draw
any more rockets

09:48.856 --> 09:50.289
and I don't want to stare
at this work again.

09:50.323 --> 09:53.059
We should have never
resigned Alfa Romeo.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.494
What, is this mystery Chevy
gonna be in "The Graduate"?

09:55.529 --> 09:57.095
Those things are
flying off the lot.

09:57.129 --> 09:59.464
Frank, are you not
on board with this?

09:59.498 --> 10:01.232
I love what you're doing.

10:02.635 --> 10:05.303
I'm tired of rockets,
that's all.

10:05.337 --> 10:08.306
Could you give us a moment?
We'll continue this later.

10:12.344 --> 10:14.211
What is that, Shalimar?

10:17.749 --> 10:19.383
What's gotten into you?

10:19.417 --> 10:21.085
You're supposed to be
calming me down.

10:21.119 --> 10:23.220
Ted, I've got cancer.

10:23.254 --> 10:25.522
What?

10:25.557 --> 10:27.592
In my pancreas.

10:27.626 --> 10:29.225
I told Jim.
I thought he told you

10:29.259 --> 10:30.994
and you didn't want
to embarrass me.

10:35.265 --> 10:36.833
No.

10:36.867 --> 10:39.335
Maybe it's more of
a financial issue to him,

10:39.369 --> 10:41.571
but I'm glad he can
keep a secret.

10:42.740 --> 10:44.007
Financial?

10:44.041 --> 10:46.942
The minute I cash out,
I cash in.

10:46.977 --> 10:48.744
You two have to buy me out.

10:51.915 --> 10:53.983
You have cancer.

10:54.017 --> 10:56.151
See, if we still had Alfa,
I wouldn't have to worry

10:56.185 --> 10:58.353
about putting you
out of business.

11:00.289 --> 11:01.723
First of all,

11:01.757 --> 11:04.158
stop talking about money.

11:04.192 --> 11:06.027
Second, we are going
to get Chevy

11:06.061 --> 11:08.295
because you're going
to do your best work.

11:08.330 --> 11:10.364
Third, you're going
to build a wing

11:10.398 --> 11:12.867
at Sloan-Kettering
and beat this thing.

11:12.901 --> 11:15.703
Aye, aye.

11:24.178 --> 11:25.712
Will you tell Jim you told me?

11:25.747 --> 11:27.914
He'll see it on your face.

11:30.618 --> 11:32.985
Everybody loves astronauts.

11:34.354 --> 11:36.689
I've got to go lie down.

11:44.330 --> 11:45.965
Well, hello there.

11:45.999 --> 11:47.599
How are things in Glocca Morra?

11:47.634 --> 11:49.901
( whispering )
Hello. Can you hear me?

11:49.935 --> 11:52.570
I love it when you whisper like that.
What are you wearing?

11:52.604 --> 11:54.472
My uniform.

11:54.506 --> 11:57.175
I have one
and his flight's delayed.

11:57.209 --> 11:59.110
Who is he?
What's he do?

11:59.145 --> 12:00.779
I'm not sure,

12:00.813 --> 12:02.881
but he doesn't believe
my name's really Daisy.

12:02.915 --> 12:04.882
Use that.

12:14.425 --> 12:16.426
Shit.

12:21.531 --> 12:23.166
Megan:
<i>Do you mind?</i>

12:24.835 --> 12:27.136
17, please.

12:31.575 --> 12:34.677
I'm sorry to bother you,
but we love your show.

12:34.712 --> 12:37.512
Oh, thank you.

- <i>( doors open )</i>

12:41.617 --> 12:43.919
Can we get an autograph?

13:08.509 --> 13:10.543
I know you're not waving to me.

13:10.577 --> 13:12.812
Makes the delay
worthwhile, doesn't it?

13:12.847 --> 13:14.748
- Headed to Detroit?
- Eventually.

13:14.782 --> 13:16.415
Should we try LaGuardia?

13:16.450 --> 13:18.517
They already did.
Forget it.

13:20.020 --> 13:22.155
This is why I like
to drive everywhere.

13:22.189 --> 13:24.290
I'd live in my car if I could.

13:24.324 --> 13:26.725
You know, with her
in the backseat navigating.

13:26.760 --> 13:29.361
- ( chuckles )
- I'm Roger.

13:29.395 --> 13:31.029
- What's your name?
- Mikey.

13:31.064 --> 13:33.565
Well, Mikey, since we're
gonna be cell mates,

13:33.599 --> 13:35.500
I'm going to ask the screw
for a couple of drinks.

13:35.534 --> 13:37.335
Jim Beam.

13:37.370 --> 13:39.604
I'll make her bring them over.

13:39.639 --> 13:42.339
- Good idea.
- I'm full of 'em.

13:42.374 --> 13:44.909
( laughs )

13:46.378 --> 13:47.979
I want a glass of water
with an onion

13:48.013 --> 13:49.747
and bring him
a double Jim Beam.

13:49.782 --> 13:51.849
And get me on that flight.

13:55.457 --> 13:56.998
_

13:58.825 --> 14:00.593
This is my day off.
We had plans.

14:00.694 --> 14:03.481
_

14:03.625 --> 14:05.836
_

14:06.399 --> 14:09.333
Well, you would rather spend the evening
laughing at Roger Sterling's jokes.

14:09.368 --> 14:12.970
I should return home.
I've overstayed my welcome.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.156
_

14:15.380 --> 14:16.512
_

14:17.517 --> 14:19.264
_

14:19.375 --> 14:21.093
_

14:22.414 --> 14:25.215
Well, I don't know
what's happened.

14:25.249 --> 14:27.250
I knew something was wrong.

14:27.285 --> 14:30.387
We have not had a fight.

14:31.389 --> 14:33.089
He's so far away

14:33.124 --> 14:35.325
that sometimes
when we're alone,

14:35.359 --> 14:37.928
I feel like
I'm making conversation.

14:37.962 --> 14:42.231
Darling, you have confounded
everyone's expectations.

14:42.265 --> 14:44.734
And it is very hard
to stand next to someone

14:44.768 --> 14:46.402
giving an autograph.

14:46.437 --> 14:49.472
- He doesn't even care.
- Of course he does.

14:49.506 --> 14:52.708
But he may think you belong more
to other people than to him.

14:53.844 --> 14:55.810
_

14:55.876 --> 14:57.652
_

14:58.291 --> 14:59.800
_

15:00.817 --> 15:03.501
_

15:03.659 --> 15:06.625
_

15:06.923 --> 15:09.424
( laughs )

15:21.336 --> 15:23.370
I love coming into the city.

15:23.404 --> 15:25.940
It's 25 minutes,
half hour give or take,

15:25.974 --> 15:28.107
from Tenafly
depending on the traffic.

15:28.141 --> 15:31.744
I always think I'm gonna
go to museums and stuff.

15:31.779 --> 15:34.046
And there's some good ones.
You've probably seen them.

15:34.081 --> 15:37.149
But I always end up at Saks.

15:37.184 --> 15:39.251
And I come home

15:39.286 --> 15:42.121
and Herb always says
the same thing.

15:42.155 --> 15:45.123
How much damage
did you do, Peaches?

15:45.157 --> 15:46.925
( laughs )

15:46.960 --> 15:48.794
We always do some shopping.

15:48.828 --> 15:50.562
My daughter is very generous.

15:50.597 --> 15:53.599
She even invited me along
to this wonderful evening.

15:57.670 --> 15:59.436
You get a hold of Silver Bells?

15:59.471 --> 16:02.573
No. That doesn't mean
he's not coming.

16:04.175 --> 16:05.776
I'm pretty much done waiting.

16:05.811 --> 16:07.712
Perhaps we should go.

16:07.746 --> 16:09.346
- What?
- ( laughs )

16:09.381 --> 16:12.984
No, I think
we're gonna order now.

16:13.018 --> 16:15.852
Herb gets very peckish.

16:15.887 --> 16:17.854
I skipped lunch.

16:26.897 --> 16:28.664
( sighs )

16:28.698 --> 16:30.933
Can I help you, Bert?

16:30.967 --> 16:32.835
You've already done
all you can do.

16:32.869 --> 16:34.537
Snapped this place into shape,

16:34.571 --> 16:37.306
expanded our business
while keeping it lean.

16:37.341 --> 16:40.409
Pending due diligence,
we're done...

16:40.443 --> 16:43.512
at $11 a share.

16:43.547 --> 16:44.980
Really?

16:45.015 --> 16:47.650
I believe I would like a drink.

16:49.118 --> 16:52.220
( chuckles ) What do you drink?

16:52.255 --> 16:53.856
Do you have any brandy?

16:53.890 --> 16:55.623
No.

16:55.658 --> 16:57.525
Spirits of elderflower?

16:57.560 --> 17:01.128
No. I don't have
any laudanum either.

17:01.163 --> 17:03.765
- Surprise me.
- Bob: <i>Night, chief.</i>

17:03.799 --> 17:05.700
Bob, could you get Joan?

17:05.733 --> 17:08.736
- And some ice.
- Absolutely.

17:12.973 --> 17:14.675
When do we break the news?

17:14.709 --> 17:17.711
Call the meeting for tomorrow.

17:20.582 --> 17:22.648
Ahh.

17:22.684 --> 17:26.352
Peaches: So there she
was in the garage

17:26.387 --> 17:29.221
right among the-- you know,
there's an oil stain

17:29.255 --> 17:31.924
that Herb's been meaning
to take care of--

17:31.959 --> 17:34.594
there she is, our little puppy,

17:34.628 --> 17:36.996
with a full litter.

17:37.358 --> 17:38.487
_

17:38.696 --> 17:40.375
_

17:40.878 --> 17:42.617
_

17:44.036 --> 17:46.671
You're right, Mother. They
must have been adorable.

17:46.706 --> 17:49.741
There's one yellow
and one brown

17:49.775 --> 17:51.810
and then three sort of mixed.

17:51.844 --> 17:54.779
Each one at its own nipple.

17:56.015 --> 17:57.448
I love puppies.

17:57.483 --> 17:59.016
Not the way she does.

17:59.050 --> 18:02.026
_

18:03.922 --> 18:05.856
You know what?
Why don't we let the men

18:05.890 --> 18:08.792
discuss the business they're
probably here to talk about

18:08.827 --> 18:10.728
while we powder our noses?

18:19.637 --> 18:23.572
Tall and tan
and young and lovely.

18:29.246 --> 18:31.613
So why are we here, Herb?

18:31.648 --> 18:35.150
Oh, it's nothing serious.
I just had an idea.

18:35.184 --> 18:37.786
There's a kid who's been
writing fliers for me

18:37.820 --> 18:39.955
at a few of my lots

18:39.989 --> 18:42.423
and I'm really getting results.

18:42.458 --> 18:44.693
He's got a good turn of phrase.

18:44.727 --> 18:46.427
I think you'd appreciate it.

18:46.462 --> 18:48.428
Is he looking for a job?

18:48.463 --> 18:50.464
( laughs ) No, he's got a job.

18:50.498 --> 18:54.001
I just thought that
it might help you and me

18:54.036 --> 18:55.903
if he were to take a look
at some of your work,

18:55.937 --> 18:57.638
even at the formative stages,

18:57.673 --> 18:59.740
just to get his take on it.

19:02.443 --> 19:04.443
What's his name?

19:05.813 --> 19:07.580
Fawcett.

19:08.883 --> 19:10.784
Chris Fawcett.

19:12.687 --> 19:15.655
Here you go.

19:15.690 --> 19:18.291
- What is this?
- It's the name of the guy

19:18.325 --> 19:20.926
who's going to be handling
your account from now on.

19:22.395 --> 19:25.030
You never fail
to overheat, do you?

19:25.065 --> 19:28.633
You know the somersaults I'm
doing 'cause you're so touchy?

19:28.668 --> 19:30.936
Really?
A man your size?

19:30.970 --> 19:34.006
You know what?

19:34.040 --> 19:37.374
Your whole company should
be taken to the woodshed.

19:37.409 --> 19:39.643
First Campbell
gives me the sass.

19:39.678 --> 19:42.180
Then Sterling,
he didn't even show up.

19:42.214 --> 19:45.750
And you-- huh, yeah--
my friend,

19:45.784 --> 19:47.719
you're gonna
be working for him.

19:47.753 --> 19:49.353
And he could
teach you something

19:49.387 --> 19:51.521
like knowing where
your bread is buttered.

19:51.555 --> 19:54.124
Why don't you get this?

19:54.158 --> 19:56.426
I want you to buy me
one last meal.

19:56.460 --> 19:58.394
I'm tired of taking it
out of your account.

19:58.429 --> 20:00.030
Okay.

20:00.064 --> 20:02.065
And if you ever
see Sterling again,

20:02.100 --> 20:04.134
tell him you screwed up

20:04.168 --> 20:06.069
'cause I'm done
with all of youse.

20:09.039 --> 20:11.707
Don't sit down.
Dinner's over.

20:11.742 --> 20:14.009
Are you okay?

20:17.114 --> 20:19.115
Never felt better in my life.

20:24.186 --> 20:26.788
Nice meeting you.
See you soon.

20:37.299 --> 20:39.233
( laughs )

20:39.267 --> 20:40.801
My mother needs an aspirin.

20:40.835 --> 20:42.803
I don't care.

20:52.781 --> 20:53.947
( gasps )

20:53.982 --> 20:55.681
<i>( thumping )</i>

20:58.018 --> 21:00.419
( phone ringing )

21:02.956 --> 21:05.491
- Hello?
- Marie.

21:05.525 --> 21:08.094
It's Roger.
I'm so glad I got you.

21:08.128 --> 21:10.429
If you are calling
to apologize, don't bother.

21:10.463 --> 21:12.864
- It's too late. Good night.
- Hold on, hold on, don't hang up.

21:12.899 --> 21:16.168
- Let me talk to Don.
- Did you call to talk to Don?

21:16.202 --> 21:19.938
Yes, but I was hoping you were there.
You were next, I swear.

21:19.972 --> 21:22.140
<i>You dragged me out</i>
<i>and made me sit</i>

21:22.175 --> 21:25.577
with that disgusting man
with his disgusting wife.

21:25.612 --> 21:28.245
She is the apple that goes
in the pig's mouth.

21:28.280 --> 21:30.782
Marie, I swear I wouldn't
have missed it for the world.

21:30.816 --> 21:33.284
It's just something came up,

21:33.319 --> 21:35.720
something very important

21:35.754 --> 21:37.422
that I need to talk
to Don about.

21:37.456 --> 21:40.558
You are speaking slowly
so I will understand?

21:40.592 --> 21:43.827
Forget... my... name.

21:45.262 --> 21:46.763
( sighs )

21:48.433 --> 21:52.202
- <i>( thumping on wall )</i>
- ( phone rings )

21:56.140 --> 21:58.942
Excuse me.

21:58.976 --> 22:01.610
Is it possible for me
to pay for my friend?

22:01.645 --> 22:05.948
( laughs ) Yes, but
it's too late for that.

22:05.982 --> 22:08.317
What are you bugging him for?

22:08.352 --> 22:10.386
Aren't I enough for you?

22:10.420 --> 22:12.955
This is my friend. What
was your fake name again?

22:12.989 --> 22:15.190
- Curious George?
- ( laughs )

22:15.225 --> 22:17.459
You're a riot.

22:31.840 --> 22:33.474
Hello.

22:34.609 --> 22:36.176
Good night.

22:39.748 --> 22:42.249
Isn't that guy a client?

22:42.283 --> 22:44.385
Is he gone?

22:44.419 --> 22:46.219
Yes.

22:51.784 --> 22:53.819
I have a high-level
accounts question.

22:53.853 --> 22:55.487
A hypothetical.

22:55.521 --> 22:57.589
So it doesn't involve
anybody in this room?

23:00.959 --> 23:04.329
Let's say you caught your father-in-law
in a compromising position.

23:04.363 --> 23:07.532
It's every Sunday night.
The guy can't hold his liquor.

23:14.239 --> 23:17.374
Last night I was celebrating
at that party house up on Lex

23:17.408 --> 23:20.210
and I saw my father-in-law
exit the bedroom

23:20.245 --> 23:22.212
with the biggest,

23:22.247 --> 23:24.981
blackest prostitute
you've ever seen.

23:25.016 --> 23:27.150
( laughing )

23:27.184 --> 23:29.885
Was there anyone else
from Vicks there?

23:29.919 --> 23:33.022
Not that I saw.
But we spoke.

23:34.424 --> 23:36.959
I mean, all I said
was hello, but--

23:36.993 --> 23:40.530
Okay, look,
when I was in high school,

23:40.564 --> 23:43.532
they had this picture come to the
only movie theater in Cabot.

23:43.566 --> 23:45.300
It was called
"Making A Baby."

23:45.334 --> 23:47.135
They invited women
and men separately,

23:47.170 --> 23:50.071
but it was a delivery system
for some filthy stuff.

23:50.105 --> 23:52.574
So at the matinee, I look over

23:52.608 --> 23:55.610
and Mr. Miller my science
teacher is five seats away.

23:55.645 --> 23:59.380
And he's not, you know, working
the slide rule or anything,

23:59.414 --> 24:02.216
but we see each other for sure.

24:02.250 --> 24:05.486
But we both knew that neither
of us should be there.

24:06.821 --> 24:08.989
It was mutually
assured destruction.

24:09.023 --> 24:11.592
So he's not going
to say anything?

24:11.626 --> 24:13.527
- He can't.
- <i>( intercom buzzes )</i>

24:13.562 --> 24:16.028
Secretary: <i>Mr. Cosgrove,
I have a phone call.</i>

24:16.063 --> 24:18.231
Give me a second.

24:18.265 --> 24:20.266
It's why I don't worry
about the bomb.

24:20.301 --> 24:22.168
- <i>( intercom buzzes )</i>
- <i>It's urgent.</i>

24:22.203 --> 24:24.804
<i>I have Hugh Hibbert</i>
<i>and John Echolls from Jaguar.</i>

24:24.838 --> 24:27.674
Why are they calling you?
Pick it up.

24:30.276 --> 24:31.843
This is Ken.

24:31.877 --> 24:34.846
Good morning.

24:34.880 --> 24:37.649
Do you have any idea where Roger
has been for the last 24 hours?

24:37.684 --> 24:40.719
- I don't.
- Draper!

24:40.753 --> 24:42.821
What in the hell have you--

24:44.156 --> 24:47.525
- What?
- You have done it again.

24:47.559 --> 24:49.193
What did you say
to Herb Rennet last night?

24:49.228 --> 24:51.095
Nothing that shouldn't have
been said last Christmas.

24:51.129 --> 24:52.597
As usual, you have
acted impulsively

24:52.631 --> 24:54.565
and harmed the company
irreparably.

24:54.600 --> 24:57.768
- Pete, calm down.
- We'd already lost the account.

24:57.802 --> 24:59.604
He was gonna bring in
some kid to write copy.

24:59.638 --> 25:01.606
That's because you
screwed him last time.

25:01.640 --> 25:03.373
You couldn't wait.

25:03.407 --> 25:06.243
Pete, you've got to
understand when it's over.

25:06.277 --> 25:08.278
Do you know that we had
a public offering underway?

25:08.312 --> 25:09.713
And now it's ruined!

25:12.116 --> 25:14.050
- What?
- You don't care about the company.

25:14.084 --> 25:15.885
- You're already rich.
- Not here.

25:15.919 --> 25:18.054
Inside.

25:22.692 --> 25:24.693
- What is going on?
- Why the hell didn't I know about this?

25:24.728 --> 25:26.862
- We're going public?
- Not anymore.

25:26.896 --> 25:29.064
- When did that happen?
- I was going to tell you this morning.

25:29.098 --> 25:31.700
I tried to last night, but you'd
rather have dinner with Herb Rennet.

25:31.735 --> 25:33.636
Well, I have some good news
and some bad news.

25:33.670 --> 25:36.337
- Where the hell have you been?
- Don fired Jaguar.

25:36.372 --> 25:37.338
What?

25:39.775 --> 25:42.577
Then I just have good news.
We're giving a presentation

25:42.611 --> 25:45.045
this Friday on Chevy's
top secret new car.

25:45.080 --> 25:46.914
- What?
- Friday?

25:46.948 --> 25:48.783
Come on, you've been thinking
about Chevy your whole life.

25:48.817 --> 25:51.752
- Are you serious?
- And I have this check for $10,000

25:51.786 --> 25:55.155
because I close, Pete.
I close things.

25:55.189 --> 25:56.890
Did I mention I was in Detroit

25:56.924 --> 25:59.459
where my friend Mikey O'Brien--
look him up--

25:59.494 --> 26:01.595
said he was looking for
something cutting-edge,

26:01.629 --> 26:03.297
but none of the agencies
had it?

26:03.331 --> 26:05.965
So he had a great idea.
Bring us in.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.933
We're not afraid of a deadline.

26:07.967 --> 26:10.569
Holy crap.
Chevy.

26:10.604 --> 26:12.171
You want to go public?

26:12.205 --> 26:13.806
How much better is it
when we have Chevy?

26:13.840 --> 26:15.408
Don't act like you had a plan.

26:15.442 --> 26:17.743
You're Tarzan
swinging from vine to vine.

26:17.778 --> 26:20.379
Roger, I want to know everything.
Pete, go box up Jaguar.

26:20.414 --> 26:22.247
Make sure they have
all their files today.

26:22.282 --> 26:24.215
Joan, get the creatives
in my office.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.050
Get them yourself.

26:28.220 --> 26:30.254
Don't you feel
300 pounds lighter?

26:30.289 --> 26:32.324
I don't.

26:32.358 --> 26:35.293
Honestly, Don, if I could deal
with him, you could deal with him.

26:36.729 --> 26:38.929
And what now?

26:38.963 --> 26:40.931
I went through
all of that for nothing?

26:42.367 --> 26:44.835
Joan, don't worry.
I will win this.

26:44.869 --> 26:46.737
Just once

26:46.771 --> 26:49.406
I would like to hear
you use the word "we."

26:49.441 --> 26:52.710
Because we're all rooting
for you from the sidelines,

26:52.744 --> 26:56.379
hoping that you'll decide whatever
you think is right for our lives.

27:00.917 --> 27:02.885
( sighs )

27:06.857 --> 27:09.559
In my office, all of you.

27:09.593 --> 27:12.026
Should we go in there?

27:12.061 --> 27:14.229
I don't care.

27:18.200 --> 27:20.268
XP-887.

27:20.302 --> 27:22.404
- So we get to name it?
- Possibly.

27:22.438 --> 27:24.439
For now it's all
cloak-and-dagger.

27:24.474 --> 27:26.140
They've got a room full
of R&D on this.

27:26.175 --> 27:28.342
But it boils down
to Chevrolet's top brass

27:28.377 --> 27:30.444
trying to build
the perfect car.

27:30.479 --> 27:33.213
- They designed it with a computer.
- So they're scared.

27:33.248 --> 27:35.516
They run another agency in
at the one-yard line.

27:35.550 --> 27:37.017
They're terrified.

27:37.051 --> 27:38.252
So who else is in it?

27:38.286 --> 27:40.488
Well, the guest list limping in

27:40.522 --> 27:43.423
is as follows--
Campbell-Ewald.

27:43.457 --> 27:45.725
Chevy's right arm. They got
200 people in Detroit.

27:45.760 --> 27:47.360
Dancer Fitzgerald Sample

27:47.395 --> 27:49.328
and Cutler Gleason and Chaough.

27:49.363 --> 27:52.465
Ha, fantastic. Two
steamships and a rowboat.

27:52.500 --> 27:55.435
You had to write that down?

27:55.469 --> 27:57.771
- There's no pictures.
- It's a GM car.

27:57.805 --> 27:59.271
It's got four wheels
and an engine.

27:59.305 --> 28:02.274
No, it's totally new.

28:04.210 --> 28:05.811
I want you to go to the library

28:05.845 --> 28:07.413
and get me everything
you can on Mustang.

28:07.447 --> 28:09.481
- And Chevy.
- No, forget that.

28:09.516 --> 28:11.249
They know there's been
nothing before Mustang

28:11.284 --> 28:13.385
and nothing after it, but
they're hoping it's this.

28:13.420 --> 28:16.387
No one and nothing
leaves my office.

28:17.355 --> 28:19.189
How about that?

28:19.224 --> 28:21.091
How 'bout it?

28:24.897 --> 28:27.364
<i>( thumping )</i>

28:32.570 --> 28:34.103
Are you okay?

28:35.740 --> 28:37.307
I just wanted to watch "Hazel,"

28:37.341 --> 28:39.042
but I can't get any reception.

28:39.076 --> 28:41.311
( laughs )

28:46.883 --> 28:48.884
I think you should go home.

28:48.919 --> 28:51.420
I love how you work every account
like it's make or break.

28:51.455 --> 28:53.422
I need some of that right now.

28:53.457 --> 28:55.491
You've been working plenty.

28:55.525 --> 28:57.726
I have a new way to go.

28:57.761 --> 29:00.696
I'd show it to you, but it's top
secret and it may be terrible.

29:00.730 --> 29:02.998
Maybe Frank's right.

29:03.032 --> 29:05.334
We should have
never dumped Alfa.

29:05.368 --> 29:08.803
It's one thing to want something,
it's another to need it.

29:08.838 --> 29:10.939
This is your agency.

29:10.974 --> 29:13.842
You're always going
to need something.

29:13.876 --> 29:15.910
Don't let Frank Gleason
make you question it.

29:15.945 --> 29:18.046
Well, it's Frank's agency,
too, Peggy.

29:18.081 --> 29:20.681
And I've been counting on his
paintbrush and his negativity

29:20.715 --> 29:22.683
to balance me out for 20 years.

29:22.717 --> 29:24.151
Fine.

29:24.186 --> 29:28.089
But I've spent a lot of time

29:28.123 --> 29:30.124
working with pessimistic people

29:30.158 --> 29:33.127
and I like the fact
that you're--

29:33.161 --> 29:34.928
Do not say I'm nice.

29:34.963 --> 29:37.230
I hate it when people
say I'm nice.

29:38.832 --> 29:41.234
I was going to say strong.

29:55.081 --> 29:57.049
I'm sorry.

29:57.083 --> 29:59.018
I'm just grateful.

30:01.687 --> 30:03.655
No, of course.

30:08.593 --> 30:10.528
Good night, Peggy.

30:15.700 --> 30:17.668
Yes.

30:17.702 --> 30:19.537
Good night.

30:30.170 --> 30:31.970
Arnold:
<i>Hold that.</i>

30:33.473 --> 30:36.274
I got it.

30:36.308 --> 30:38.842
You want to go celebrate?
I just quit my job.

30:38.877 --> 30:42.246
What? Really?

30:42.281 --> 30:44.382
I had a heart and a kid
who needed the heart

30:44.416 --> 30:45.949
and now they're both dead.

30:45.984 --> 30:47.918
I'm not gonna get
the opportunity.

30:47.952 --> 30:51.055
I'm tired of fighting.

30:51.089 --> 30:53.090
Well, you're fighting
God in a way.

30:53.124 --> 30:54.725
Oh, bullshit.

30:54.759 --> 30:56.860
You don't think
God's in Houston?

30:56.895 --> 30:58.696
My hospital chickened out

30:58.730 --> 31:01.732
and now some asshole down
there is taking my place

31:01.766 --> 31:04.301
in history while I piss away
my life in New York City.

31:04.335 --> 31:07.137
- You can't think that way.
- ( sighs )

31:07.172 --> 31:09.739
- <i>( doors open )</i>
- Fate hasn't chosen me.

31:09.773 --> 31:12.374
Look...

31:12.409 --> 31:16.245
I don't cut people open.
I don't believe in fate.

31:16.279 --> 31:18.848
You make your own
opportunities.

31:18.882 --> 31:21.818
You sure you don't want
to go for a drink?

31:21.852 --> 31:24.652
I got work.

31:32.195 --> 31:34.129
<i>( door closes )</i>

31:34.163 --> 31:37.432
- How'd it go?
- I don't know.

31:37.466 --> 31:39.201
I was gonna sleep on it,

31:39.235 --> 31:41.969
but now I think I'm just
gonna shower and go back in.

31:46.507 --> 31:48.776
I love you like this.

31:48.810 --> 31:50.711
Desperate and scared?

31:50.746 --> 31:53.147
Fearless.

31:53.181 --> 31:55.049
And I want to do whatever I can

31:55.083 --> 31:57.316
to make sure you do not fail.

31:57.351 --> 32:00.019
Then you can jump
from the balcony

32:00.054 --> 32:02.622
and fly to work like Superman.

32:11.465 --> 32:13.031
<i>( buckle clicks )</i>

32:13.066 --> 32:15.300
<i>( zipper unzips )</i>

32:15.334 --> 32:17.870
<i>( jet engine roaring )</i>

32:20.339 --> 32:22.274
Will there be anything else?

32:22.308 --> 32:24.109
No, thank you, Daisy.

32:25.178 --> 32:27.712
Actually, can you
get those lugs

32:27.747 --> 32:29.613
from Dancer
bumped off the flight?

32:29.648 --> 32:33.084
Roger, I told you,
I can't hurt the company.

32:33.118 --> 32:35.153
They bought most of the seats.

32:36.588 --> 32:38.455
Jesus, there's like
eight of them.

32:40.592 --> 32:42.293
Surprised to see you here.

32:42.327 --> 32:43.894
Taking your kid
to look at colleges?

32:43.928 --> 32:46.263
No, taking him
to pick out a car.

32:46.297 --> 32:48.899
Oh. When did they add
you guys to the mix?

32:48.933 --> 32:50.400
When they saw your work.

32:50.434 --> 32:52.869
I wish you the best of luck.

32:52.904 --> 32:56.072
In fact,
maybe we shouldn't even go.

32:56.107 --> 32:57.841
What are the billings
for Vicks?

32:57.875 --> 33:00.575
Nine million? Someone's
gonna pick that up.

33:02.712 --> 33:04.914
( coughs )

33:04.948 --> 33:07.016
Any of you have a cough drop?

33:07.050 --> 33:09.518
- I know they don't.
- ( men laugh )

33:13.523 --> 33:15.691
Get him on the phone right now
or I'm coming over there.

33:15.725 --> 33:17.591
I've got it, Clara.

33:17.626 --> 33:19.460
Roger's calling
from the airport.

33:19.494 --> 33:21.196
He says something happened
with Vick Chemical.

33:21.230 --> 33:23.431
Tell my father-in-law
I am not joking.

33:23.465 --> 33:25.566
Believe me, you do not
want me in your lobby.

33:25.600 --> 33:27.535
Let me talk to Roger.

33:27.569 --> 33:29.370
So it's true?

33:29.404 --> 33:31.539
No, I'm gonna fix it.

33:33.241 --> 33:35.142
Jesus, they don't need
to hear this right now.

33:35.176 --> 33:37.244
Roger will handle it.

33:46.020 --> 33:48.621
- Well?
- They're screwing with us.

33:48.656 --> 33:50.657
Really?

33:50.691 --> 33:52.492
Daisy's gonna lose
their luggage.

33:52.526 --> 33:53.960
( chuckles )

34:09.708 --> 34:12.277
Well, apparently you
didn't get any of my calls.

34:12.311 --> 34:14.045
So I came down here
to your lair.

34:14.080 --> 34:16.114
Spare me the outrage, Pete.

34:16.148 --> 34:17.649
I'm tired of it.

34:20.452 --> 34:23.987
Tom, what are you doing?

34:24.022 --> 34:26.858
I know we're both
emotional and vulnerable,

34:26.891 --> 34:28.626
but I'm not the enemy here.

34:28.659 --> 34:30.895
I'm an adult, as are you.

34:30.929 --> 34:33.398
And if anything,
our relationship

34:33.431 --> 34:35.400
has shown over
the last seven years

34:35.434 --> 34:38.333
that I have
a very short memory.

34:38.369 --> 34:41.405
Now, what can I do

34:41.438 --> 34:42.972
to bring you back to reality

34:43.007 --> 34:45.341
in this obviously
impulsive decision?

34:45.376 --> 34:48.945
My daughter is a princess.

34:48.978 --> 34:52.014
She could have had anyone.

34:52.049 --> 34:55.016
I knew there was a reason
you never wanted children.

34:55.051 --> 34:58.153
You have no business
being a father.

34:58.187 --> 35:01.290
You just pressed
the button, Tom.

35:01.324 --> 35:03.258
You just blew everything up.

35:03.293 --> 35:06.729
Well, it makes me sick
thinking about the man I saw

35:06.763 --> 35:08.863
being with my daughter
and my granddaughter.

35:08.898 --> 35:10.665
Why don't you look
in the mirror?

35:10.699 --> 35:13.000
You can walk out like a man

35:13.035 --> 35:15.670
or I can have you thrown out
like the lowlife you are.

35:21.176 --> 35:23.210
If I have as low character
as you say,

35:23.245 --> 35:24.711
why would you
push me like this?

35:24.746 --> 35:26.513
You'll do the right thing.

35:28.516 --> 35:30.417
( scoffs )

35:33.988 --> 35:36.757
The paint fumes
are making me sick.

35:38.426 --> 35:39.960
I got the windows open.

35:39.994 --> 35:41.727
It'll be dry
in a couple of days.

35:41.762 --> 35:43.563
And when am I gonna
be able to walk around

35:43.597 --> 35:45.498
my apartment in bare feet?

35:45.532 --> 35:47.400
Soon.
We're fixing it up.

35:47.435 --> 35:50.136
In here, yes.
But out there?

35:50.171 --> 35:52.372
Those kids are living
on our stoop

35:52.406 --> 35:55.575
lighting firecrackers
and playing their music.

35:55.609 --> 35:57.509
And you keep waving to them.

35:57.543 --> 35:59.544
Look, the neighborhood
is changing.

35:59.579 --> 36:01.013
We're a part of that.

36:01.047 --> 36:02.514
I don't like change.

36:02.548 --> 36:04.183
I want everything to stay
the way it was.

36:04.217 --> 36:05.985
I don't think
you understand, babe.

36:06.019 --> 36:09.388
Everything's getting better.
Johnson's gone.

36:09.422 --> 36:11.290
The war is gonna end.

36:11.324 --> 36:13.358
We're gonna have a new
president no matter what.

36:13.392 --> 36:16.461
Maybe McCarthy.
Worst case, Kennedy.

36:16.495 --> 36:19.063
I love Bobby Kennedy.

36:19.098 --> 36:21.099
Ted:
<i>Fine.</i>

36:23.568 --> 36:27.138
If that's what you want.

36:29.207 --> 36:31.541
I just want you to kiss me.

36:46.156 --> 36:48.790
( <i>"Palo Mayombe" playing</i> )

36:58.674 --> 37:00.475
( sighs )

37:01.944 --> 37:04.579
( <i>"Gabriel" playing</i> )

37:11.219 --> 37:13.253
Damn it.

37:15.390 --> 37:17.425
Hello to you, too.

37:17.459 --> 37:19.760
What the hell
are you doing in Detroit?

37:19.795 --> 37:23.162
My doctor recommended
an ocean voyage.

37:23.196 --> 37:25.197
Can I get one of those?

37:25.232 --> 37:26.933
I don't believe this.

37:26.967 --> 37:29.335
I spent six weeks
on this pipe dream

37:29.369 --> 37:31.604
and it's gonna be over
in two seconds.

37:33.707 --> 37:35.575
( chuckles )
Hell, I knew I was good,

37:35.609 --> 37:37.943
but I didn't know
all I had to do was show up.

37:37.977 --> 37:40.178
You don't know what this means?

37:42.415 --> 37:44.416
It's not my job
to put you at ease,

37:44.451 --> 37:46.017
but just because
they brought us in

37:46.052 --> 37:47.586
at the last second
doesn't mean you're dead.

37:47.620 --> 37:49.521
Me?
We're both dead.

37:50.957 --> 37:52.758
I've had enough
psychological warfare today.

37:52.792 --> 37:54.592
- Why don't you take a table?
- Think about it.

37:54.626 --> 37:57.495
When it's two top 10 agencies
and me, I've got a chance.

37:57.529 --> 38:00.197
Now that there's two
little guys, we're DOA.

38:00.231 --> 38:02.867
I'm not worried.
I've got great work.

38:02.901 --> 38:05.970
Of course you do. And mine's
even better, I guarantee.

38:06.004 --> 38:08.372
You know how this works. They're
gonna take our creative

38:08.406 --> 38:10.807
and give it to one
of the big boys.

38:10.842 --> 38:14.143
Second place, tied with last.

38:16.714 --> 38:18.748
Come on, you know I'm right.

38:18.783 --> 38:21.518
So they want a name brand.

38:21.552 --> 38:23.487
- We had a car.
- So did we.

38:25.789 --> 38:27.756
It's not the same thing.

38:27.791 --> 38:29.492
It's the size of the team.

38:29.526 --> 38:31.226
It's opening an office
in Detroit.

38:31.260 --> 38:32.895
This is General Motors.

38:32.929 --> 38:34.964
They fight the war
with bodies on the ground.

38:36.432 --> 38:38.400
I saw Dancer at the airport.

38:38.434 --> 38:40.836
Looked like half my office.

38:44.373 --> 38:46.774
This business is rigged.

38:49.111 --> 38:50.879
Damn it.

38:50.913 --> 38:52.814
That's what I said.

38:52.848 --> 38:54.716
Sorry about that.

38:56.118 --> 38:58.886
I'm tired of this crap.

38:58.920 --> 39:01.989
I should just let Chevy buy
my brain and put it in a jar.

39:02.023 --> 39:03.289
Can I get another?

39:04.626 --> 39:06.560
Brain in a jar.

39:06.594 --> 39:08.629
Put it on your tombstone.

39:09.864 --> 39:12.933
"Here lies SCDP,

39:12.967 --> 39:15.568
the little company
with the big ideas."

39:15.602 --> 39:19.539
"CGC, giving away creative
one car at a time."

39:19.573 --> 39:21.440
( chuckles )

39:23.109 --> 39:25.144
So what did you go with?

39:26.713 --> 39:28.414
What, I show you mine,
you show me yours?

39:28.448 --> 39:31.016
What's the difference
at this point?

39:31.050 --> 39:33.251
You first.

39:33.285 --> 39:35.554
Okay, but I've got to stand up.

39:40.492 --> 39:43.728
This is a car for the young
and the young at heart.

39:43.763 --> 39:46.463
Because today nobody knows
where they're headed,

39:46.497 --> 39:48.632
but they're not afraid
of what's around the bend.

39:48.667 --> 39:51.869
Power plus design
equals adventure.

39:51.903 --> 39:55.372
Throw the map out the window
and hit the road, Jack.

39:55.406 --> 39:56.941
Then I sing the song.

40:01.145 --> 40:03.312
- That's good.
- No kidding.

40:06.917 --> 40:09.586
Just music.
People's faces.

40:09.620 --> 40:12.889
All kinds-- teenagers,
dads, moms.

40:12.923 --> 40:15.592
Different expressions
of wonder.

40:15.626 --> 40:18.426
What could this possibly be?

40:18.461 --> 40:20.128
It's so new,

40:20.162 --> 40:23.632
this combination of power,

40:23.666 --> 40:25.901
technology, comfort, and price

40:25.935 --> 40:28.870
that it's impossible
to imagine.

40:30.607 --> 40:33.241
But not at Chevy.

40:33.275 --> 40:35.009
The future

40:35.043 --> 40:37.344
is something you haven't
even thought of yet.

40:39.147 --> 40:42.149
You run that for a week,

40:42.183 --> 40:44.351
then you finally show the car.

40:47.823 --> 40:49.923
That's interesting.

40:49.957 --> 40:51.958
Hooray.

40:56.631 --> 40:58.498
( Ted sighs )

40:58.532 --> 41:00.500
So should we go home?

41:05.872 --> 41:08.273
We--

41:08.307 --> 41:10.275
that's interesting.

41:10.309 --> 41:12.277
Why, you want to stay
just so Chevy

41:12.311 --> 41:14.146
can put a feather in your cap?

41:15.548 --> 41:17.215
I have a better idea.

41:17.250 --> 41:18.951
No, you don't.
I just heard it.

41:18.985 --> 41:20.719
This is why everyone hates you.

41:20.754 --> 41:23.287
Think about it.

41:23.321 --> 41:26.958
Both of us have the creative,

41:26.992 --> 41:29.260
but neither of us
have an agency to match.

41:33.999 --> 41:35.733
Why would I do that?

41:35.768 --> 41:37.601
Because we're dead.

41:39.503 --> 41:42.072
Even if I were to consider
that, Chevy calls the shots.

41:42.106 --> 41:45.008
Hey, Lieutenant,

41:45.043 --> 41:47.510
want to get into some trouble?

41:47.545 --> 41:49.512
How would that even work?

41:49.547 --> 41:53.150
Well, one of us, probably me,

41:53.184 --> 41:55.885
will have to figure out
a way to make Chevy

41:55.919 --> 41:57.753
think it was their idea
to combine our agencies.

41:57.788 --> 42:00.990
And then the other one,
let's say it was you,

42:01.024 --> 42:03.425
will have to figure out what the
hell we're going to present.

42:03.459 --> 42:05.861
Well, we have partners.

42:07.297 --> 42:09.565
Who aren't sitting in this bar.

42:09.599 --> 42:11.733
Can I get another?

42:13.535 --> 42:15.804
No, we're done.

42:19.575 --> 42:21.542
We've got a long night.

I want to make it clear,

42:43.263 --> 42:45.798
unless this works,
I'm against it.

42:45.833 --> 42:47.834
I was just saying
the same thing.

42:49.069 --> 42:50.203
Shall we?

42:50.237 --> 42:52.271
After you.

43:05.451 --> 43:08.353

43:12.625 --> 43:15.059
You're not supposed to be
here till the weekend.

I don't like you surprising me.

43:17.162 --> 43:19.263

No.

43:31.776 --> 43:33.777
And I don't care, Peter.

43:33.811 --> 43:36.579
You understand that we were
going to be very rich,

43:36.613 --> 43:37.946
but he's ruined that.

43:37.981 --> 43:40.283
He's done everything for you.

43:40.317 --> 43:42.618
( scoffs )
He's a hypocrite, Trudy.

43:42.653 --> 43:45.154
Don't you dare
criticize my father.

43:49.859 --> 43:51.327
I guess it doesn't matter

43:51.361 --> 43:53.262
that I caught him
in a Midtown whorehouse.

43:53.296 --> 43:55.697
Just stop it right now.

43:55.731 --> 43:59.100
It's true. With a 200-pound
Negro prostitute.

43:59.134 --> 44:02.036
Ask him to his face.

44:02.070 --> 44:04.339
You'll say anything
to hurt me, won't you?

44:04.373 --> 44:06.140
He wanted it this way.

44:06.175 --> 44:07.676
He left me no other choice.

44:07.710 --> 44:10.277
You had lots of choices, Peter.

44:10.312 --> 44:12.346
We're done.
Get your things.

44:40.173 --> 44:43.208
So, how'd it go?

44:43.242 --> 44:46.578
We got it.
We won Chevy.

44:49.349 --> 44:51.049
What are you doing here?

44:51.083 --> 44:53.084
We went in together.

44:53.118 --> 44:54.919
What?

44:54.954 --> 44:56.655
What are you talking about?

44:56.689 --> 44:58.756
They wanted our ideas
and a big agency,

44:58.790 --> 45:00.290
so we gave them both.

45:01.693 --> 45:03.761
Just for Chevy?

45:03.795 --> 45:05.863
No, we merged--

45:05.897 --> 45:07.898
furniture, fixtures,
everything.

45:09.100 --> 45:11.769
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

45:14.037 --> 45:16.339
I did this wrong once before,

45:16.374 --> 45:18.842
so let me tell you
how great it's going to be

45:18.876 --> 45:20.910
and you can decide
if you want to come along.

45:20.944 --> 45:23.212
You are the copy chief

I'm jealous.

I just bought an apartment.

45:35.592 --> 45:37.393
Congratulations.

45:42.966 --> 45:44.833
Are we moving?

45:44.868 --> 45:48.103
We are, and we'd like you
to write the press release.

45:48.137 --> 45:50.372
For what?

45:50.406 --> 45:52.407
We don't have a name yet,

45:52.441 --> 45:55.110
but make it sound
like the agency

45:55.144 --> 45:56.677
you want to work for.
