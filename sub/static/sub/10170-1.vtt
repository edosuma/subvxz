01:19.648 --> 01:22.378
- To a wonderful film. You were great.
- Thank you.

01:22.450 --> 01:25.613
- What a romantic you are.
- To the agency and my little protÃ©gÃ©.

01:25.687 --> 01:27.621
Bless you.
Thank you, daddy.

01:30.458 --> 01:33.222
Eight years at Berlitz,
that's what you learn?

01:33.295 --> 01:35.126
He learned chin the first month
and then chin-chin.

01:35.197 --> 01:37.062
Am I right?

01:37.132 --> 01:38.565
I can't be clever.

01:38.633 --> 01:40.726
It was really beautiful,
what you guys did.

01:40.802 --> 01:44.738
It was beautiful,
and you guys are great.

01:44.806 --> 01:46.171
I love the food here.

01:46.241 --> 01:50.735
The nicest thing about the film
is that we get to handle guns.

01:50.845 --> 01:52.779
- I had never done that.
- Peter.

01:52.847 --> 01:54.280
- Very rare.
- What?

01:54.349 --> 01:56.749
- How are you?
- Wow. Ben, how are you?

01:56.818 --> 01:58.752
Outstanding, sir.

02:01.089 --> 02:04.354
Excuse me.
Ben Sanderson, Marc Nussbaum.

02:04.426 --> 02:06.690
- Of course.
- How are you?

02:06.761 --> 02:08.524
- Sheila.
- Ladies.

02:08.597 --> 02:11.191
- Hi, Ben.
- Nice to meet you.

02:11.266 --> 02:16.966
I'm a big fan of your writing.
I thought Bay of Pigs was great.

02:17.038 --> 02:21.498
Actually, I didn't write it,
I just got the credit. I was fired.

02:21.610 --> 02:26.047
Didn't I talk to you a couple
of years ago when you both worked...

02:26.147 --> 02:29.548
- at MGM with Laddie?
- That's right, by God.

02:29.618 --> 02:32.553
So are you still at ICM?

02:32.621 --> 02:36.717
- I'm at TriStar.
- You're at TriStar.

02:36.791 --> 02:40.557
- You'll have to say hello to Mike.
- I will.

02:40.629 --> 02:45.089
He's not there anymore,
but I'll hunt him down.

02:45.166 --> 02:48.067
- Can I talk to you, please?
- Sure.

02:48.136 --> 02:49.899
- Please?
- Be right back.

02:49.971 --> 02:53.532
Hold the fort, kiddo.
I have my own office this way.

02:53.642 --> 02:56.133
- What is the matter with him?
- He's sick.

02:56.244 --> 02:58.542
I can't help you anymore.
Do you understand?

02:58.613 --> 03:03.346
This is the last time. I promise.
I just need some cash tonight.

03:03.418 --> 03:07.411
- How are you?
- I lost my credit cards.

03:07.489 --> 03:10.356
The money will be on your desk
first thing in the morning.

03:10.425 --> 03:14.361
How's the new one coming along?
I hear you got Dickie Gere.

03:14.429 --> 03:18.195
- That is great, man.
- I got everybody in the movie.

03:18.266 --> 03:21.201
Look, you're sick.

03:21.269 --> 03:23.703
This is all I have in cash.

03:23.772 --> 03:27.367
Please, don't drink it in here.

03:28.643 --> 03:31.510
- Man.
- That's fine, Peter.

03:31.579 --> 03:34.047
I'll messenger it over to you
in the morning.

03:34.149 --> 03:37.050
I don't want it.

03:37.118 --> 03:41.384
I think it would be the best thing
if you don't contact me again.

03:51.132 --> 03:54.158
- What's your name?
- Terri.

03:54.235 --> 03:57.170
- Terri, I am going to buy you a drink.
- I'm okay. Thanks.

03:59.641 --> 04:03.372
Bud, please. Buy the lady a drink
and another one for you.

04:03.478 --> 04:05.810
I'm Benjamin. Ben.

04:05.880 --> 04:09.179
Benny Goodman, that's me.
I think you're sexy. That's right.

04:09.250 --> 04:12.686
Look at those eyes.
Sexy like a kitty cat.

04:12.754 --> 04:14.847
You turn me on

04:16.925 --> 04:19.017
You're not too tall
You're not too short

04:19.094 --> 04:20.857
You're not too round

04:20.928 --> 04:24.558
You're like a cat
The cat in the hat

04:24.632 --> 04:27.032
Look at those eyes.
Honest to God.

04:27.102 --> 04:29.696
You're luminescent, baby.
What?

04:29.771 --> 04:33.537
- You've been drinking all day.
- Of course.

04:33.641 --> 04:36.201
Speaking of drinks,
here is yours.

04:36.311 --> 04:37.744
- Thanks.
- Down that hatch.

04:37.812 --> 04:40.246
And here is mine.
Cheers. Come on.

04:40.315 --> 04:43.716
There we go.
Let's do it to it.

04:48.456 --> 04:52.051
I just thought
of an amazing concept.

04:52.127 --> 04:54.254
What do you say
we finish these...

04:54.329 --> 04:57.389
and we go back
to my apartment on the beach!

04:57.465 --> 04:59.797
I'll throw a movie in the VCR...

04:59.868 --> 05:02.735
and mix you up
a gooey blender drink.

05:02.804 --> 05:04.135
Sound good? Sound sexy?

05:18.086 --> 05:20.452
Bud, give me another.

05:23.224 --> 05:28.526
I really wish you'd come home with me.
You're so cute.

05:28.596 --> 05:31.394
I'm really good in bed too.
Believe me.

05:33.234 --> 05:36.533
And you smell great...

05:36.604 --> 05:39.539
and you look great
and your hair's great.

05:44.479 --> 05:47.812
Look, I've got to wake up early
in the morning.

05:47.882 --> 05:51.374
I have to go. Thank you.

05:57.959 --> 06:00.154
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.

06:02.897 --> 06:05.627
Maybe I shouldn't breathe so much.

06:13.441 --> 06:16.467
That's it, pal.
We're closing up now.

06:16.578 --> 06:18.546
I'm gonna finish this.

07:47.735 --> 07:52.229
Hey, Mr. Erection,
you want a date?

07:53.441 --> 07:56.535
The room is 20.
You pay for it.

07:58.079 --> 08:00.343
But only because I think...

08:00.415 --> 08:05.682
that the concept of surrender...

08:05.753 --> 08:10.349
fits with the big picture right now.

08:14.596 --> 08:17.156
Hey, get outta the street!

08:22.704 --> 08:28.006
I don't remember
if I started drinking...

08:28.109 --> 08:30.839
because my wife left me or...

08:30.945 --> 08:35.177
my wife left me
'cause I started drinking.

08:35.249 --> 08:37.183
Fuck it anyway!

09:35.710 --> 09:37.177
Next, please.

09:44.919 --> 09:46.352
One moment, sir.

09:50.258 --> 09:52.783
Sign the back
of the check, please.

09:54.395 --> 09:59.355
- Can't you just cash it as it is?
- Is there a problem?

10:11.245 --> 10:13.338
I'm a little shaky right now.

10:16.050 --> 10:17.984
I had brain surgery.

10:18.052 --> 10:22.148
I'll go get some lunch,
and then I'll come back...

10:22.223 --> 10:24.714
and take care of it then.

10:30.098 --> 10:32.828
Next I'll have a gin and tonic.

10:35.436 --> 10:37.870
Do you know what time it is?

10:39.607 --> 10:42.371
You should be drinking coffee.

10:42.443 --> 10:44.206
You're a young guy.

10:47.782 --> 10:51.513
It's none of my business...

10:51.586 --> 10:55.852
but if you could see
what I see...

10:55.923 --> 10:58.357
you wouldn't be doing this
to yourself.

11:04.899 --> 11:08.335
I understand
what you're saying.

11:08.402 --> 11:11.166
I appreciate your concern.

11:12.507 --> 11:15.635
It's not my intention
to make you uncomfortable.

11:17.245 --> 11:22.148
Please, serve me today,
and I'll never come in here again.

11:22.216 --> 11:24.309
If I do, you can 86 me.

11:24.385 --> 11:26.319
Stop fucking with me!

11:27.388 --> 11:29.822
I can 86 you anytime I want to.

11:44.939 --> 11:48.375
I don't give a fuck what you do.

11:48.442 --> 11:51.468
That one's on the house, son.

11:51.546 --> 11:53.377
Were you in Los Angeles
for the earthquake?

11:53.447 --> 11:55.711
- It was pretty scary.
- Did you have a lot of damage?

11:55.783 --> 11:59.344
- Just a little bit.
- Are you desirable?

11:59.420 --> 12:02.116
Are you irresistible?

12:02.190 --> 12:05.455
Maybe if you drank bourbon with me,
it would help.

12:05.526 --> 12:10.054
If you kissed me, and I could taste
the sting in your mouth, it would help.

12:10.164 --> 12:11.825
If you drank bourbon with me naked...

12:11.933 --> 12:15.801
if you smelled of bourbon
as you fucked me, it would help.

12:15.870 --> 12:18.964
It would increase
my esteem for you...

12:19.040 --> 12:23.773
if you poured bourbon on your naked body
and said to me, "Drink this."

12:23.845 --> 12:28.942
If you spread your legs and you had
bourbon dripping from your breasts...

12:29.016 --> 12:32.782
and your pussy and said,
"Drink here"...

12:33.888 --> 12:35.981
then I could
fall in love with you.

12:36.057 --> 12:39.493
Because then I would have a purpose:
to clean you up.

12:39.560 --> 12:43.894
And that would prove...

12:43.998 --> 12:46.364
that I'm worth something.

12:46.434 --> 12:52.031
I'd lick you clean so that you could
go away and fuck someone else.

12:52.106 --> 12:54.040
Our business is
to make our customers happy.

12:55.877 --> 12:58.072
Next, please.

12:59.513 --> 13:01.413
I am back.

13:01.482 --> 13:05.248
I've got my check,
and, baby, I'm ready to sign.

13:08.422 --> 13:10.117
There.

13:11.459 --> 13:14.519
Steady as a fucking rock.
Excuse my French.

13:16.597 --> 13:18.622
Want to have dinner with me?

13:20.101 --> 13:23.628
But what's the back end like?

13:23.738 --> 13:27.037
By the time we're through
with P and A...

13:27.108 --> 13:29.975
the "above the line"
is gonna take it to about 15.

13:30.044 --> 13:33.013
With something like this,
what would Disney think?

13:35.082 --> 13:36.481
Messages.

13:36.550 --> 13:38.814
What did Diller say?

13:40.054 --> 13:42.648
Listen, I'm very busy.
Just kidding.

13:42.723 --> 13:45.317
Can I call you back on this?

13:45.393 --> 13:47.827
Ciao for now.

13:47.929 --> 13:50.363
Could somebody fix the phones
around here?

13:50.431 --> 13:52.763
- Good morning.
- Mr. Simpson's looking for you.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.733
He wants you to go in
as soon as you get...

13:59.774 --> 14:02.971
- Are you all right?
- Outstanding.

14:03.044 --> 14:08.778
But I have to go
to a very important meeting.

14:08.849 --> 14:11.283
Could make a couple million
for the company.

14:17.692 --> 14:19.125
What?

14:22.563 --> 14:24.997
You should go in there now.

14:32.073 --> 14:35.008
- Hi, Bill.
- Take a seat.

14:44.885 --> 14:47.683
We're gonna let you go.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.807
This is too generous, Bill.

15:16.684 --> 15:21.246
We really liked having you around,
but you know how it is.

15:21.322 --> 15:22.949
I'm sorry.

15:27.194 --> 15:30.652
What are you gonna do now?

15:36.570 --> 15:38.162
I thought...

15:40.241 --> 15:43.176
I thought
I'd move out to Las Vegas.

16:10.204 --> 16:12.638
My name is Yuri Botsov.

16:12.706 --> 16:14.799
Where you from, Yuri?

16:14.875 --> 16:18.367
You sure don't sound like you come
from around these parts.

16:18.446 --> 16:20.971
That is very true.

16:21.048 --> 16:23.414
Very good observation.
I am from Latvia.

16:25.319 --> 16:27.082
Very tough place.

16:27.154 --> 16:30.612
I hear this,
but I am not a tough man.

16:30.691 --> 16:35.094
I am a humble man who is here to learn
from my friends in the New World.

16:58.886 --> 17:01.582
This must be Yuri's friend.

17:01.655 --> 17:05.386
Sera is my gift to you all.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.921
You will find her a very willing girl
for each of you...

17:09.029 --> 17:11.088
just as we arranged.

17:12.833 --> 17:15.329
So, I have business to attend.
Please, enjoy.

17:15.365 --> 17:17.827
So, I have business to attend.
Please, enjoy.

17:28.649 --> 17:30.583
Do you wanna watch?

18:24.805 --> 18:26.739
Are you scared?

18:34.014 --> 18:35.914
It's all right.

18:37.651 --> 18:39.585
It's okay.

18:51.332 --> 18:53.926
I bring out the best
in the men who fuck me.

18:54.001 --> 18:56.595
It's not easy,
but I'm very good.

18:56.670 --> 19:00.197
It's amazing. I haven't worked
for a really long time...

19:00.274 --> 19:02.868
and I can just turn on a dime.

19:02.943 --> 19:05.138
I can just become
who they want me to be.

19:05.212 --> 19:07.874
I walk into that room,
I know right away...

19:07.982 --> 19:10.177
this is their fantasy,
and I become it.

19:10.284 --> 19:14.550
I'm that service.
I perform it, and I perform it well.

19:14.622 --> 19:16.055
I'm an equation mostly.

19:16.123 --> 19:21.390
Thirty minutes of my body
costs $300.

19:21.462 --> 19:23.726
That's just to get into the room.

19:23.797 --> 19:27.233
It's about $500 after that.
We negotiate.

19:27.301 --> 19:30.031
But it's a performance.

19:30.104 --> 19:32.629
It's definitely a performance.

19:32.706 --> 19:36.403
I am very pleased with how
you've moved up in the world.

19:36.477 --> 19:40.174
It is, after all,
a glamorous world I showed you.

19:43.951 --> 19:47.580
Why did you leave me
in Los Angeles?

19:50.157 --> 19:52.091
Because you are sly.

19:53.827 --> 19:56.261
You knew there was more money
here in Las Vegas.

20:00.167 --> 20:03.261
You don't need to fear me, Sera...

20:03.337 --> 20:05.601
because we belong together.

20:06.840 --> 20:09.104
Don't we?

20:20.154 --> 20:23.920
- Are you lonely?
- I am lonely, Yuri.

20:23.991 --> 20:25.754
So am I.

22:52.072 --> 22:56.406
Janek, we called you last night!

22:56.477 --> 22:58.707
There was no one home.

23:00.747 --> 23:04.547
We're 30 miles
outside of Las Vegas.

23:04.618 --> 23:09.555
Someone saw him there yesterday.

23:13.460 --> 23:16.452
No, this is the end of it!

23:16.530 --> 23:21.024
Yuri knew what he was doing.

23:49.263 --> 23:51.561
That was a red light.

23:51.632 --> 23:53.566
I walk, you stop.

23:54.501 --> 23:56.765
Are you sorry?

23:56.837 --> 23:58.805
Good.

24:20.327 --> 24:23.819
Three towels in each room
and a complimentary bar of soap.

24:23.897 --> 24:28.857
If you run out of soap,
you can buy an extra bar.

24:28.936 --> 24:31.496
Feel free to use our pool,
but use it at your own risk.

24:31.572 --> 24:34.700
- There are three towels in your room.
- Do you have vacancies?

24:35.776 --> 24:38.210
We do.
I'll be with you in a minute.

24:38.278 --> 24:42.214
Linens are provided for you.
Rooms are $29 a night.

24:42.282 --> 24:46.343
You pay at the beginning of each week.
Maid service is optional.

24:51.058 --> 24:56.223
Maid service is optional.
It costs $3.50 a day.

24:56.296 --> 24:59.390
Feel free to use the pool,
but use it at your own risk.

24:59.466 --> 25:01.559
We don't have a lifeguard.

25:01.635 --> 25:06.572
No kids, no pets and no guests
after 11:00 at night.

25:06.640 --> 25:08.574
You've been provided
with three towels.

25:08.642 --> 25:12.578
We expect when you check out
there will still be three towels.

25:12.646 --> 25:14.477
There's a complimentary
bar of soap.

25:15.816 --> 25:19.308
I walked into the room,
and he was lying on the bed.

25:19.386 --> 25:22.651
He had his arms
behind his head...

25:22.723 --> 25:26.159
and there was
just hair everywhere.

25:26.226 --> 25:29.024
He was really, really fat.

25:29.096 --> 25:31.428
He had a large erection.

25:31.498 --> 25:36.128
I remember he was so proud
of his large erection.

25:39.973 --> 25:44.307
I asked him where my money was,
and he pointed to the dresser.

25:44.378 --> 25:47.142
And then I asked him
what he wanted...

25:47.214 --> 25:52.618
and he said,
"Lie down, I'm on top."

25:52.686 --> 25:58.124
He started pounding me
really hard.

25:59.359 --> 26:03.295
I had to bite my tongue
to keep from crying.

26:04.865 --> 26:08.961
He did that for awhile,
and then I started to get up.

26:09.036 --> 26:13.803
He pushed me back down,
and he held my hair.

26:13.907 --> 26:19.345
He was pulling it,
and he stuck his penis in my mouth.

26:19.413 --> 26:24.908
I tried to get up again,
and he said...

26:24.985 --> 26:29.979
"Stay there, baby,
I'm gonna come on your face."

26:30.057 --> 26:33.584
So he did.

26:33.660 --> 26:37.596
Then he rubbed his semen
all over my face and in my hair.

26:40.801 --> 26:45.864
Then he kicked me off the bed
and told me to leave.

27:17.671 --> 27:20.697
- Are you working?
- What do you mean? I'm walking.

27:20.807 --> 27:23.776
Just wait one second.

27:24.711 --> 27:26.144
Great ass!

27:29.683 --> 27:33.210
- Want some?
- Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?

27:36.623 --> 27:38.557
That's pretty funny.

27:38.625 --> 27:42.220
I wonder if you'll take $250
to fuck me?

27:44.131 --> 27:47.567
That is, if you'll come
to my room for one hour...

27:47.634 --> 27:49.898
I will give you $500.

27:51.304 --> 27:55.240
- You're pretty drunk.
- Not really.

27:55.342 --> 27:57.867
My room's not far.
It's The Whole Year Inn.

27:57.978 --> 28:02.005
You could drive with me if you want
or we could walk.

28:03.283 --> 28:04.716
Or I could give you cab fare.

28:04.785 --> 28:06.377
- In the car.
- Whatever you want.

28:06.453 --> 28:08.887
Why don't you give me the money
in the car?

28:17.397 --> 28:19.058
I'm Ben.

28:19.633 --> 28:21.396
I'm Sera.

28:31.344 --> 28:34.336
Sarah with an "H"?

28:35.749 --> 28:39.014
With an "E." S-e-r-a.

28:43.924 --> 28:45.858
You wanna start the engine?

29:04.644 --> 29:07.078
What this room needs
is more booze.

29:08.481 --> 29:11.041
- Can I use the bathroom?
- Of course.

29:12.452 --> 29:15.319
Want a drink?
I'm having one.

29:15.388 --> 29:19.051
Sure. I'll have a shot of tequila,
if you can spare it.

29:45.252 --> 29:46.810
Your drink's here.

29:54.761 --> 29:58.697
For 500 bucks, you can do
pretty much whatever you want.

29:58.765 --> 30:02.565
- You can fuck my ass.
- Oh, my God.

30:02.636 --> 30:08.438
You can come on my face.
Whatever you want to do.

30:08.541 --> 30:13.240
Just keep it out of my hair.
I just washed it.

30:34.701 --> 30:39.297
Just because my feet
were too big in the morning

30:39.372 --> 30:43.775
Just because I can't remember
your mother's name

30:43.843 --> 30:50.214
Just because I put the octopus
in the bed

30:50.317 --> 30:55.152
Just because, because
because, because Bill Cosby

30:59.025 --> 31:01.016
You wanna fuck now?

31:03.797 --> 31:08.200
Maybe something to drink first.
More tequila?

31:09.135 --> 31:10.659
Whatever.

31:47.507 --> 31:51.307
What's the story?
Are you too drunk to come?

31:53.246 --> 31:56.374
I don't care about any of that.

32:00.620 --> 32:06.217
There's time left.
You can have more money.

32:06.292 --> 32:09.227
You can drink all you want.

32:09.295 --> 32:12.389
Just stay.
That's what I want.

32:12.465 --> 32:17.493
I want you to talk or listen.

32:17.570 --> 32:19.060
Just stay.

32:37.590 --> 32:41.356
So, Ben with an "N"...

32:41.428 --> 32:43.589
what brings you to Las Vegas?

32:43.663 --> 32:45.187
Business convention?

32:53.106 --> 32:58.567
I came here
to drink myself to death.

32:58.678 --> 33:02.131
Cashed in all my money...

33:02.166 --> 33:05.550
[Skipped item nr. 294]

33:05.585 --> 33:07.678
gonna sell the car tomorrow.

33:10.957 --> 33:14.358
How long is it gonna take
for you to...

33:14.427 --> 33:16.861
drink yourself to death?

33:21.634 --> 33:25.627
I think about four weeks.

33:25.738 --> 33:28.206
I don't know for sure,
but I think.

33:28.308 --> 33:34.076
I got enough
for about 250, $300 a day.

33:34.147 --> 33:36.047
That should do it.

33:37.584 --> 33:40.382
What am I? A luxury?

33:43.323 --> 33:47.089
You're a luxury,
and your meter just ran out.

33:47.160 --> 33:49.321
That's a nice watch.

33:49.395 --> 33:51.886
You do like it?

33:55.034 --> 33:58.003
You can talk
a little bit more.

33:58.104 --> 34:00.368
I don't have to be anywhere.

34:01.774 --> 34:03.207
Talk.

34:04.777 --> 34:06.870
In Los Angeles...

34:08.815 --> 34:11.875
I kept running out of booze
and the store would be closed...

34:11.951 --> 34:15.079
because I forget
to look at my watch.

34:18.358 --> 34:22.192
I used to live in Los Angeles.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.965
But I don't anymore.

34:31.070 --> 34:34.233
I think the tough times
are finally behind me.

34:36.576 --> 34:41.536
There'll always
be bad things, but...

34:41.614 --> 34:43.911
my life is good.

34:45.118 --> 34:47.416
It is as I want it to be.

34:50.924 --> 34:53.222
It's good.

34:56.496 --> 35:00.626
It's good being here with you.

35:18.117 --> 35:19.675
Shit.

35:38.304 --> 35:41.569
Hey, Bill.
How are you?

35:57.724 --> 35:59.658
Is this a full night's work?

36:02.028 --> 36:04.155
I'm really sorry.

36:04.230 --> 36:07.427
It was such a slow night,
and I couldn't score.

36:13.106 --> 36:14.869
What do you think?

36:14.941 --> 36:17.910
You're just a 16-year-old girl
on Hollywood Boulevard?

36:17.977 --> 36:20.878
Is that what you think?
Is that what you play?

36:34.427 --> 36:36.019
Here.

36:40.300 --> 36:41.767
Go ahead.

37:03.289 --> 37:06.315
I could kill you, Sera.

37:09.729 --> 37:12.323
You work tonight,
and you bring me the money.

37:12.432 --> 37:14.525
It doesn't matter how late.

37:15.635 --> 37:18.035
I will.

37:21.941 --> 37:25.035
He cut me a couple of times.

37:25.111 --> 37:29.673
He'd always say,
"Never on the face."

37:32.251 --> 37:34.549
So, he cut me right here.

37:36.956 --> 37:39.857
He cried...

37:39.926 --> 37:45.125
and I felt sorry for him.

37:45.231 --> 37:47.461
In his mind,
I'd done something bad...

37:47.567 --> 37:51.128
but in my mind
I hadn't done anything bad.

37:51.237 --> 37:53.330
He's kind of paranoid.

38:04.317 --> 38:06.785
This ring is a ruby.
It's my lucky ring.

38:06.853 --> 38:09.481
This watch is real gold.
It's not plated.

38:09.555 --> 38:11.921
It's the real thing.
Feel how heavy it is.

38:11.991 --> 38:16.951
- These rings, $3,000.
- One thousand.

38:17.029 --> 38:20.021
One thousand?
Look what you're getting.

38:20.133 --> 38:23.261
It's a ruby. It's my lucky ring.
It's a beautiful thing.

38:23.369 --> 38:26.532
I can put that in.
Two thousand dollars.

38:26.606 --> 38:31.543
- I can't give you more than a thousand.
- But I just added the ring.

38:31.611 --> 38:33.772
- Synthetic ruby.
- Look...

38:33.846 --> 38:36.076
What can I do for you?

38:44.090 --> 38:46.081
Five hundred.

38:48.828 --> 38:54.095
Five hundred dollars
for a 1993 Rolex Daytona watch.

38:56.202 --> 38:57.635
I'll do it.

39:02.175 --> 39:06.009
- How are you doin'?
- I'm doing fine, thank you.

39:08.514 --> 39:11.642
Are you here for the convention?

39:11.717 --> 39:13.742
I didn't think I was that obvious.

39:15.555 --> 39:20.424
- It was just a wild guess.
- My name's Paul, honey.

39:22.895 --> 39:25.989
- Vodka Seven.
- And for the lady?

39:26.098 --> 39:28.566
- Are you ready for another one?
- Sure.

39:28.668 --> 39:30.829
- I'll have a margarita.
- Good choice.

39:33.940 --> 39:35.669
Are you alone?

39:36.843 --> 39:39.471
Or are you using me
to make someone jealous?

39:39.545 --> 39:42.480
Alone. I'm here alone.

39:43.716 --> 39:45.581
Thank you.

39:46.819 --> 39:48.753
Cheers.

39:51.190 --> 39:53.784
Where are you staying?

39:53.860 --> 39:56.124
Right here at the hotel.
Why?

39:57.563 --> 40:00.123
I thought
you might be looking for a date.

40:00.233 --> 40:03.669
"A date"?
What are you, a hooker?

40:03.736 --> 40:06.227
What exactly do you mean
by a date?

40:06.339 --> 40:08.500
I got a wife waiting
for me at home.

40:08.574 --> 40:12.510
- I just came over to talk.
- I'm sorry. I guess I misunderstood.

40:12.578 --> 40:15.308
- I guess you did.
- Just keep your voice down.

40:15.381 --> 40:17.645
I won't bother you again.

40:18.718 --> 40:21.380
Here, have another one on me.

40:21.454 --> 40:22.978
Christ.

40:26.726 --> 40:29.490
Maybe you should give it a miss
for tonight.

40:38.437 --> 40:41.634
I don't know, it's just...

40:41.707 --> 40:45.700
I really like this guy.
I've never felt anything...

40:45.778 --> 40:48.658
for anyone I've ever been with,
as a trick.

40:48.693 --> 40:51.539
for anyone I've ever been with,
as a trick.

40:51.651 --> 40:54.586
It's weird.
I feel kind of confused about it.

40:54.654 --> 40:57.088
We were with each other
only one night...

40:57.156 --> 40:59.351
but I felt like
the relationship...

40:59.425 --> 41:03.691
I felt like there was
a relationship being formed.

41:03.763 --> 41:05.731
I was kind of scared.

41:08.935 --> 41:11.199
I don't think
I should see him again.

41:12.438 --> 41:14.269
But I look for him.

41:16.242 --> 41:20.269
I went out last night.
I was looking for him.

41:37.964 --> 41:40.091
Where's your car?

41:40.166 --> 41:42.726
I sold it this morning.

41:43.970 --> 41:46.438
I'm gonna take cabs from now on.

41:48.774 --> 41:53.438
What's it tonight?
Another 500 to watch you sleep?

41:59.585 --> 42:03.043
- What's up?
- I was looking for you tonight.

42:03.122 --> 42:07.024
I don't know
if you have a boyfriend...

42:07.093 --> 42:09.857
or a girlfriend...

42:09.929 --> 42:13.865
but, if you have
some free time...

42:13.933 --> 42:18.529
I thought maybe
we could get some dinner.

42:21.040 --> 42:22.974
Are you serious?

42:24.110 --> 42:27.443
I think you know I'm serious.

42:29.782 --> 42:35.049
I'll pay you if you like,
but I just want to see you.

42:46.899 --> 42:49.663
I can't have dinner with you.

42:54.940 --> 42:56.999
We could get prime rib.

42:58.778 --> 43:01.838
They've got it on sale for $2.99.

43:06.419 --> 43:08.353
I love that dress.

43:56.402 --> 43:59.496
I had a really good night.

44:01.774 --> 44:05.210
I think things
are finally picking up.

44:05.277 --> 44:08.246
We made so much money.
Look.

44:08.347 --> 44:10.008
Come here.

44:31.103 --> 44:35.039
Now listen.
Do you hear?

44:36.475 --> 44:39.535
They're talking about me.

44:56.262 --> 44:58.662
Are you all right?

45:07.573 --> 45:08.972
Get out.

45:17.449 --> 45:22.079
Do not come back here.
I'll not see you again.

46:30.089 --> 46:32.683
Do you still wanna have dinner?

47:10.396 --> 47:13.490
I think I put too much salt on it.

47:15.401 --> 47:18.165
- It's not good.
- It's good.

47:25.945 --> 47:31.349
- Why are you a drunk?
- Why am I a drunk?

47:31.417 --> 47:33.942
Is that really
what you want to ask me?

47:39.758 --> 47:44.354
Then this is our first date
or our last.

47:44.430 --> 47:46.864
Until now,
I wasn't sure it was either.

47:50.569 --> 47:52.867
First.

47:52.938 --> 47:54.872
It's our first.

47:56.375 --> 47:58.843
I just wanna know.

47:58.944 --> 48:01.538
Why are you killing yourself?

48:02.614 --> 48:04.980
Interesting choice of words.

48:07.052 --> 48:12.149
I don't remember.
I just know that I want to.

48:12.224 --> 48:14.692
Is your drinking a way
to kill yourself?

48:14.760 --> 48:16.623
- Or killing myself is a way to drink.
- Very clever.

48:16.658 --> 48:18.486
- Or killing myself is a way to drink.
- Very clever.

48:22.267 --> 48:23.700
Shoot.

48:25.738 --> 48:27.672
Can I have another one?

48:49.862 --> 48:53.320
What are you thinking?
Are you angry?

49:19.625 --> 49:21.456
Good night.

49:25.064 --> 49:29.330
- I had the most wonderful...
- Why don't you stay at my place tonight?

49:31.403 --> 49:34.395
Look, you're pretty drunk.

49:34.473 --> 49:40.343
- I like you. I trust you.
- Wow. That's astonishing, Sera.

49:40.412 --> 49:42.880
I hate to think of you
in that cheesy motel.

49:42.948 --> 49:46.714
I'll move to a real smart hotel tomorrow
if it makes you feel better.

49:48.720 --> 49:53.157
Let's talk about tomorrow.
Do you want to do something?

49:53.258 --> 49:57.160
We'll talk about it tonight
at my place.

49:59.531 --> 50:02.398
I'm not much good in the sack.

50:04.036 --> 50:06.470
It's not about sex.

50:06.538 --> 50:08.972
I'll make you up a bed
on the sofa.

50:09.041 --> 50:12.602
We'll talk till late.
We'll sleep till late.

50:12.678 --> 50:15.579
As you know,
I am my own boss.

50:19.184 --> 50:21.175
Do it, Ben.

50:27.693 --> 50:29.320
I'll do it.

50:50.048 --> 50:52.642
This is the home of an angel.

50:54.920 --> 50:57.650
- Are you okay?
- Of course.

51:00.092 --> 51:03.186
You look extremely beautiful.

51:05.430 --> 51:07.295
I do?

51:21.980 --> 51:26.849
It's really weird because...

51:26.952 --> 51:28.681
you know...

51:28.787 --> 51:31.517
it's just like
this thing's happening...

51:31.623 --> 51:33.557
really quickly.

51:35.294 --> 51:37.854
I just don't know
what's going on.

51:37.930 --> 51:41.730
Just the second I met him,
and the way I said my name.

51:41.800 --> 51:46.169
I just said, "Hi, my name's Sera,"
and that's not what I do.

51:46.238 --> 51:48.832
And it's just...

51:48.907 --> 51:51.501
It's all happening really quickly.

51:51.577 --> 51:55.479
I just felt like
we've been together for a long time.

51:55.547 --> 51:58.641
It just felt so easy...

51:58.717 --> 52:01.982
and I felt like...

52:02.087 --> 52:04.521
I felt like I was me.

52:04.590 --> 52:07.024
I didn't feel like I was...

52:08.260 --> 52:10.023
trying to be somebody else.

52:34.953 --> 52:37.615
When is your rent coming up
at the motel?

52:37.723 --> 52:39.657
What do you mean?

52:41.727 --> 52:47.324
I think you should go
and bring all your stuff over here.

52:54.506 --> 52:58.442
- Sera, you are crazy.
- So?

52:58.510 --> 53:01.877
Don't you think you'll get
a little bored living with a drunk?

53:04.249 --> 53:09.482
- That's what I want.
- You haven't seen the worst of it.

53:09.588 --> 53:12.955
These last few days,
I've been very controlled.

53:13.025 --> 53:17.121
I knock things over
and throw up all the time.

53:20.532 --> 53:24.468
Right now I feel really good.

53:27.506 --> 53:32.569
You're like an antidote that mixes
with the liquor and keeps me in balance.

53:32.644 --> 53:35.875
But that won't last forever.

53:42.888 --> 53:45.186
All right,
you go back to your motel.

53:45.257 --> 53:49.091
I'll go back to my glamorous life
of being alone.

53:53.131 --> 53:56.658
The only thing I have to come home to
is a bottle of mouthwash...

53:56.735 --> 53:59.203
to take the taste
of come out of my mouth.

54:00.839 --> 54:05.833
I'm tired of being alone.
That's what I'm tired of.

54:27.999 --> 54:30.934
Don't you like me, Ben?

54:34.773 --> 54:37.742
What you don't understand is...
No. See? No.

54:37.809 --> 54:39.504
What?

54:43.014 --> 54:48.475
You can never, never...

54:48.553 --> 54:50.987
ask me to stop drinking.

54:52.557 --> 54:55.287
Do you understand?

54:57.562 --> 54:59.826
I do.

54:59.644 --> 55:01.373
I really do.

55:22.500 --> 55:25.833
I'm nuts about you.

56:02.807 --> 56:04.365
We didn't know...

56:04.475 --> 56:06.943
- whether to call the police.
- He has been here about half an hour.

56:07.045 --> 56:11.311
- I know that...
- Mickey had seen you two together.

56:11.382 --> 56:14.647
I wasn't opening the door.
I don't know who, I don't know where...

56:14.719 --> 56:17.984
I don't know what,
I don't know whatever these days.

56:18.056 --> 56:23.619
He's my friend. I'm sorry.
He must have had too much to drink.

56:23.695 --> 56:28.462
That's why I had him patch the key code.
Because he's not gonna do it.

56:28.533 --> 56:30.296
I'll help him inside.
Thank you so much.

56:30.368 --> 56:32.461
- I'm so sorry to bother you.
- No trouble.

56:32.537 --> 56:35.973
You just give me a call
if you need any help.

56:36.074 --> 56:38.736
Ben, can you wake up?

56:44.082 --> 56:48.280
We gotta go inside,
but I have some presents for you.

56:48.353 --> 56:49.843
Up we go.

56:52.257 --> 56:54.452
- Here we go.
- This is Mrs. Van Houten.

56:54.525 --> 56:56.117
This is Ben.

56:56.194 --> 56:57.752
Outstanding, sir.

56:57.829 --> 57:00.593
All right.
Here we go.

57:00.665 --> 57:02.428
- You're okay?
- I'm fine.

57:02.500 --> 57:05.264
- Good.
- I'm so sorry to bother you.

57:05.336 --> 57:08.271
- Thank you for being so nice.
- Sure.

57:08.373 --> 57:11.308
- All right.
- Bye-bye.

57:13.878 --> 57:17.177
Sorry.
I was miles away.

57:18.883 --> 57:20.316
The gifts.

57:23.388 --> 57:25.322
I love that name.

57:29.027 --> 57:32.963
Before we proceed onwards,
there's something I have to say.

57:37.368 --> 57:41.964
I've come this far.
Here I am, in your house.

57:43.241 --> 57:47.701
- Let me pay this month's rent.
- Why?

57:48.813 --> 57:50.303
Because...

57:51.416 --> 57:54.544
Because it's better for me
that way.

58:01.526 --> 58:06.190
I'll tell you right now...

58:06.264 --> 58:08.425
I'm in love with you.

58:14.005 --> 58:17.634
But, be that as it may,
I am not here...

58:17.742 --> 58:22.509
to force my twisted soul
into your life.

58:22.580 --> 58:24.980
I know that.

58:25.049 --> 58:27.813
We both know I'm a drunk.

58:29.921 --> 58:31.980
And I know you're a hooker.

58:33.391 --> 58:35.951
I hope you understand
that I'm a person...

58:36.027 --> 58:38.621
who is totally
at ease with this...

58:38.696 --> 58:42.928
which is not to say that
I'm indifferent or I don't care.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.127
I do.

58:45.203 --> 58:49.264
It simply means I trust
and accept your judgment.

58:51.209 --> 58:54.440
I was really worried
about how that would be...

58:54.512 --> 58:57.276
but now I'm not.

59:02.453 --> 59:04.785
But you should know that included
with the rent around here...

59:04.856 --> 59:06.983
is a complimentary blow job.

59:10.828 --> 59:13.194
I suppose sooner or later
we ought to fuck.

59:15.666 --> 59:17.600
Whatever that means.

59:20.271 --> 59:23.365
- Open your presents.
- Presents!

59:27.044 --> 59:28.477
All right.

59:30.181 --> 59:32.149
Open this one first.

59:41.426 --> 59:43.451
Very nice.

59:45.596 --> 59:48.463
This should go very nicely
with my suit...

59:48.533 --> 59:50.728
which, by the way,
is the only item of clothing...

59:50.802 --> 59:54.238
I brought over
from the motel with me.

59:54.305 --> 59:56.967
Right.
The suitcase was clinking.

59:57.074 --> 59:58.939
What did you do
with your clothes?

59:59.010 --> 01:00:03.003
I threw them out,
which was perhaps immoral...

01:00:03.114 --> 01:00:05.947
but I wanted to come to you clean,
so to speak.

01:00:06.017 --> 01:00:09.111
Thought we'd go shopping
for a pair of jeans...

01:00:09.187 --> 01:00:14.386
and 45 pairs of underwear,
and just throw one out each day.

01:00:14.459 --> 01:00:17.257
That's nice talk, Ben.
Keep drinking.

01:00:17.328 --> 01:00:22.925
Between the 101-proof breath
and the occasional drool...

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.764
some interesting words
fall from your mouth.

01:00:53.798 --> 01:00:56.892
It looks like
I'm with the right girl.

01:00:59.804 --> 01:01:02.705
I'm very impressed
you would buy this for me.

01:01:07.612 --> 01:01:10.274
I'm gonna fill it right now.

01:01:11.849 --> 01:01:13.783
Do you want
to go gambling tonight?

01:01:13.851 --> 01:01:18.618
I was thinking we could go
and just play for a few hours.

01:01:19.857 --> 01:01:22.587
I hadn't planned to gamble...

01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:24.924
but if you could keep
the bulk of my money...

01:01:24.996 --> 01:01:30.263
I could safely blow
a couple hundred bucks.

01:01:30.334 --> 01:01:32.825
Giving you money
makes me want to come.

01:01:38.709 --> 01:01:40.142
Then come.

01:02:22.186 --> 01:02:23.619
I'm sorry.

01:02:25.856 --> 01:02:27.721
I love you.

01:02:44.375 --> 01:02:48.141
- You got a 13.
- Hit me.

01:02:48.212 --> 01:02:51.909
- Wait. She's got a seven.
- I don't know. You tell me.

01:02:51.983 --> 01:02:56.443
- Hit.
- I'm busted. That's all right.

01:03:20.344 --> 01:03:23.905
You got it.
You can do it.

01:03:24.015 --> 01:03:27.451
Wait a minute!
Really? Oh, man!

01:03:27.518 --> 01:03:28.951
- What?
- He's okay.

01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:31.454
Do you want anything?

01:03:31.522 --> 01:03:36.585
Yeah, maybe a Bloody Mary.
Can you make that?

01:03:36.661 --> 01:03:38.424
What?

01:03:41.999 --> 01:03:44.763
Fuck you! Fuck!
You fucker!

01:03:50.007 --> 01:03:53.875
That boy is...
You can't judge me!

01:03:53.978 --> 01:03:57.539
You! I am his father!

01:03:57.648 --> 01:03:59.081
Get up!

01:04:01.986 --> 01:04:03.749
Let's go, guys.

01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:53.922
How are you?

01:05:53.998 --> 01:05:55.431
Very well.

01:05:58.502 --> 01:06:01.767
I never expected
to have to ask this again...

01:06:01.839 --> 01:06:04.103
but how did our evening go?

01:06:07.711 --> 01:06:10.646
I remember getting
to the casino.

01:06:12.383 --> 01:06:17.480
And I remember kissing you.
That was really nice.

01:06:18.889 --> 01:06:20.982
And then playing blackjack...

01:06:21.058 --> 01:06:23.117
and then security came.

01:06:23.194 --> 01:06:27.824
But after that, everything's a blank.
What happened?

01:06:27.898 --> 01:06:31.129
They wanted to carry you out
and dump you onto the street...

01:06:31.202 --> 01:06:35.161
but I talked them
into letting me walk you out.

01:06:35.239 --> 01:06:38.572
That's impressive.

01:06:38.642 --> 01:06:40.576
How did you do that?

01:06:43.514 --> 01:06:45.948
I told them
that you were an alcoholic...

01:06:48.052 --> 01:06:50.111
and that I would take you home...

01:06:51.622 --> 01:06:55.023
and that we would never
go in there ever again.

01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:02.064
"We"?

01:07:13.911 --> 01:07:16.209
That's amazing.

01:07:16.313 --> 01:07:18.338
What are you?

01:07:18.449 --> 01:07:24.251
Some sort of angel visiting me
from one of my drunk fantasies?

01:07:26.590 --> 01:07:28.888
How can you be so good?

01:07:32.429 --> 01:07:34.897
I don't know
what you're saying.

01:07:39.236 --> 01:07:42.296
I'm just using you.

01:07:42.373 --> 01:07:44.739
I need you.

01:07:48.279 --> 01:07:52.238
Can we not talk about it anymore?
Not a word.

01:07:56.153 --> 01:07:57.620
You go back to sleep...

01:07:57.721 --> 01:08:01.782
and I'll go out
and get us some breakfast.

01:08:01.859 --> 01:08:05.351
- Will you be careful?
- Don't worry.

01:08:21.879 --> 01:08:24.473
Ben, I'm working tonight.

01:08:28.218 --> 01:08:29.810
I know.

01:08:46.537 --> 01:08:50.473
I fuckin' talk all the time
because you never fuckin' listen to me!

01:08:50.541 --> 01:08:54.033
- So fuck you!
- Shut the fuck up.

01:08:56.779 --> 01:09:00.944
I'd like a beer
and a double Kamikaze, please.

01:09:02.653 --> 01:09:06.453
We mustn't kick the bar.
We lean into the bar.

01:09:06.523 --> 01:09:08.787
Just lean into the railing.

01:09:10.027 --> 01:09:13.462
It's not vino veritaz.
It's en vino veritaz.

01:09:13.529 --> 01:09:15.589
Who the fuck are you talking to?

01:09:15.666 --> 01:09:20.433
Little brown-nosed gnomes
with a slingshot.

01:09:25.175 --> 01:09:29.942
- To be in drunk.
- Lean into the bar?

01:09:30.046 --> 01:09:32.345
You lean into the bar.

01:09:33.884 --> 01:09:37.411
My boyfriend over there
is really boring the shit out of me...

01:09:37.488 --> 01:09:39.888
and I was wondering
if you would buy me a drink?

01:09:39.957 --> 01:09:42.517
Do you mind
if I buy her a drink?

01:09:42.593 --> 01:09:47.792
- I don't care what you do with her.
- I'll have a rum and Coke, please.

01:09:47.865 --> 01:09:50.231
Barman, a rum and Coke.

01:09:54.304 --> 01:09:57.432
Can I stay with you for awhile?

01:09:57.508 --> 01:10:01.410
You mean move in with me?
Isn't this a bit sudden?

01:10:01.512 --> 01:10:04.948
I don't have a lot of things.

01:10:05.015 --> 01:10:08.951
I don't think my wife
would dig it very much.

01:10:09.019 --> 01:10:14.685
Then maybe we should just go
to a motel and fuck all day.

01:10:14.758 --> 01:10:17.852
I could suck you like this.

01:10:17.928 --> 01:10:20.522
I'm sure fucking you
would be wonderful...

01:10:20.597 --> 01:10:25.534
but it's almost impossible for me
to imagine being with someone else.

01:10:25.602 --> 01:10:29.436
Now listen, asshole,
I'm not just gonna sit here...

01:10:29.506 --> 01:10:31.770
and watch her suck on your ear!

01:10:31.842 --> 01:10:34.276
Shut the fuck up!

01:10:40.884 --> 01:10:42.818
I am sorry...

01:10:42.886 --> 01:10:46.686
but she and I have decided to spend
a few hours together...

01:10:46.824 --> 01:10:48.883
in a motel.

01:10:48.992 --> 01:10:51.358
And after that, caviar.

01:10:55.299 --> 01:10:57.062
Baby, wait up!

01:11:04.641 --> 01:11:07.576
You're quite a fighter.

01:11:07.644 --> 01:11:09.737
Here.

01:11:09.813 --> 01:11:13.909
Listen,
this may sound silly...

01:11:13.984 --> 01:11:15.918
but I have to ask you
to leave.

01:11:15.986 --> 01:11:19.319
It's what we do around here
when there's a fight.

01:11:19.389 --> 01:11:21.414
The men's room
is around the back.

01:11:29.333 --> 01:11:31.426
Sexy.

01:11:35.839 --> 01:11:37.272
I'm back.

01:11:40.511 --> 01:11:42.775
Oh, my God.

01:11:42.846 --> 01:11:45.406
- Did I scare you?
- What happened?

01:11:47.351 --> 01:11:49.945
Fuck, Ben.
Did you get in a fight?

01:11:51.355 --> 01:11:53.380
I thought you said
you didn't fight.

01:11:54.658 --> 01:11:57.058
How do you feel?

01:11:57.127 --> 01:12:01.223
Like the kling-klang king
of the rim-ram room.

01:12:01.298 --> 01:12:03.232
Did you stop at a bar?

01:12:04.568 --> 01:12:07.059
Did you say something stupid
to somebody stupid?

01:12:07.137 --> 01:12:09.071
Absolutely not.

01:12:10.641 --> 01:12:14.771
I was defending the honor
of some poor wayward maiden.

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:18.914
I bet you were.

01:12:23.153 --> 01:12:27.112
Why don't you go take a shower
and put on your other shirt?

01:12:27.191 --> 01:12:30.922
Then we'll go shopping
and buy you some new clothes.

01:12:30.994 --> 01:12:33.428
I think this shirt is unlucky.

01:12:35.165 --> 01:12:36.928
Not at all.

01:12:38.001 --> 01:12:39.935
Your blood tastes good.

01:12:43.173 --> 01:12:45.232
We got eggs.

01:12:45.309 --> 01:12:48.938
I always had a fantasy
of being a flamenco dancer.

01:12:51.181 --> 01:12:52.705
I think you look great.

01:12:52.783 --> 01:12:54.717
We'll just get you a bow tie...

01:12:54.785 --> 01:12:57.879
and then you can be one
of those blackjack dealers.

01:12:57.955 --> 01:13:00.719
- All right?
- They wear it because they have to.

01:13:00.824 --> 01:13:03.520
I'll wear it
because I want to...

01:13:03.627 --> 01:13:05.891
which will make me
look different.

01:13:09.933 --> 01:13:11.560
Let's get a drink!

01:13:13.136 --> 01:13:14.569
- What is that?
- What?

01:13:14.638 --> 01:13:19.268
Holy cow.
It came out of your ear!

01:13:21.011 --> 01:13:22.945
I didn't have time
to write you a card...

01:13:23.013 --> 01:13:25.413
with you breathing down
my neck all day...

01:13:25.482 --> 01:13:27.609
so you'll just have
to wing it, baby.

01:13:29.019 --> 01:13:30.452
Open it.

01:13:41.531 --> 01:13:44.591
They're your color.

01:13:44.668 --> 01:13:47.364
I think you should wear
one of them at a time.

01:13:47.437 --> 01:13:50.770
One of these
and one of your other ones.

01:13:50.841 --> 01:13:54.208
I was gonna buy you just one...

01:13:54.278 --> 01:13:56.405
but I didn't think it would fly.

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:59.074
Nurse!
As a gift, I mean.

01:14:05.122 --> 01:14:07.488
I'll wear them tonight.

01:14:09.126 --> 01:14:10.684
One of them.

01:14:16.967 --> 01:14:19.060
Tonight.

01:14:19.136 --> 01:14:20.899
Put it on.

01:14:27.444 --> 01:14:30.277
I can't get it.

01:14:30.347 --> 01:14:32.281
I'll help you.

01:14:36.987 --> 01:14:41.617
You'll be able to feel it,
sharp and hot under your ear...

01:14:41.725 --> 01:14:45.126
as one of the brothers
is putting your head facedown...

01:14:45.195 --> 01:14:48.631
into one
of the penthouse pillows.

01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:27.102
Wait!

01:15:31.742 --> 01:15:34.438
Maybe you should wait.

01:15:37.214 --> 01:15:40.911
- Why?
- You can tell.

01:15:40.984 --> 01:15:42.918
She really wants you to.

01:16:03.407 --> 01:16:05.398
Maybe I should
follow you around...

01:16:05.475 --> 01:16:10.310
and ask one of your tricks
what it's like to sleep with you.

01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:12.314
They wouldn't know.

01:16:15.852 --> 01:16:18.116
Maybe you should ask me
sometime.

01:16:18.188 --> 01:16:20.452
Be happy to show you.

01:16:23.527 --> 01:16:26.724
I'm gonna be home around 3:00.

01:16:26.797 --> 01:16:30.164
If you're back, we could
watch some TV or something.

01:16:33.203 --> 01:16:37.469
What I'm saying is that I hope
you're back when I get home.

01:16:40.844 --> 01:16:43.005
Be careful.

01:16:44.881 --> 01:16:48.009
You be careful too.

01:16:48.084 --> 01:16:50.552
I'm gonna miss you.

01:16:57.761 --> 01:17:01.197
I know this really cool place
in the desert.

01:17:01.264 --> 01:17:03.198
We could go away
for a couple days.

01:17:07.003 --> 01:17:08.532
I'd like that.

01:17:08.567 --> 01:17:10.062
I'd like that.

01:17:24.187 --> 01:17:27.623
I make comic faces and...

01:17:27.691 --> 01:17:31.218
stand on my head and grin at you
between my legs and...

01:17:33.597 --> 01:17:35.622
I know loads of jokes.

01:17:38.902 --> 01:17:40.767
Wouldn't stand a chance,
would I?

01:17:49.546 --> 01:17:53.778
You did tell me
I ought to find myself a girl.

01:17:55.418 --> 01:17:57.613
I like it here with you.

01:18:00.490 --> 01:18:02.890
Let's stay for awhile.

01:18:40.864 --> 01:18:44.300
- Need a mix master.
- What?

01:18:44.367 --> 01:18:48.633
Just sort of take everything
and blend it all together.

01:20:35.345 --> 01:20:37.279
Take this off.

01:21:20.323 --> 01:21:22.382
- Let's go inside.
- All right.

01:21:36.005 --> 01:21:38.098
I want my drinky.

01:21:45.515 --> 01:21:48.780
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

01:21:55.425 --> 01:21:58.360
You're bleeding.
Wait. Hold it.

01:21:58.461 --> 01:22:02.898
- There's glass in here.
- I'm like a prickly pear!

01:22:04.467 --> 01:22:07.231
- I'm a prickly pear!
- Go inside.

01:22:07.303 --> 01:22:12.070
- I wanna clean up the glass.
- Go inside. I'll take care of it.

01:22:12.142 --> 01:22:13.905
Are you sure?

01:22:14.978 --> 01:22:16.570
All right.

01:22:29.759 --> 01:22:33.217
- Everybody okay?
- We're fine.

01:22:33.329 --> 01:22:35.559
I'm so sorry.
We'll pay for the table...

01:22:35.665 --> 01:22:39.601
- and I'll clean this up.
- Don't worry.

01:22:41.171 --> 01:22:43.435
You seem prepared for accidents.

01:22:43.506 --> 01:22:45.667
We get a lot of screw-ups here.

01:22:47.076 --> 01:22:51.604
You two take your loud talk
and your liquor to your room.

01:22:51.681 --> 01:22:53.376
You check out
first thing tomorrow.

01:22:53.449 --> 01:22:56.043
I don't want to see
either of you here ever again.

01:22:56.119 --> 01:22:58.212
Don't you worry
about paying for anything.

01:22:58.288 --> 01:23:01.451
And don't you worry about cutting
your little hands on the glass.

01:23:01.524 --> 01:23:04.220
Let's just leave it at that.

01:23:04.327 --> 01:23:07.057
See you in the morning.

01:24:34.817 --> 01:24:36.751
I'm in here, Ben.

01:24:44.093 --> 01:24:46.561
I bought some plain rice.

01:24:46.663 --> 01:24:50.155
You probably don't want
to hear it right now, but...

01:24:50.266 --> 01:24:52.530
I think it's something
that you could eat.

01:24:53.636 --> 01:24:56.196
If you get hungry,
will you let me know?

01:25:55.298 --> 01:25:57.892
I think I'm ready for rice.

01:26:14.017 --> 01:26:16.281
I want you to see a doctor.

01:26:29.065 --> 01:26:31.966
I'm not gonna see a doctor.

01:26:36.539 --> 01:26:39.804
Maybe it's time
I moved to a hotel.

01:26:41.711 --> 01:26:43.474
And do what?

01:26:44.547 --> 01:26:47.038
Rot away in a room?

01:26:52.055 --> 01:26:54.888
We're not gonna talk about that.

01:26:54.957 --> 01:26:56.891
Fuck you.

01:26:59.295 --> 01:27:01.229
You're staying here.

01:27:03.232 --> 01:27:06.929
You're not going to any motel.

01:27:07.003 --> 01:27:10.439
It's just one thing
you can do for me.

01:27:12.241 --> 01:27:14.709
That's all I ask.

01:27:14.777 --> 01:27:16.836
I've given you
gallons of free will.

01:27:16.913 --> 01:27:19.438
You can do this one thing for me!

01:27:30.827 --> 01:27:32.920
I have to go to work now.

01:28:10.333 --> 01:28:13.268
Snake eyes!

01:28:17.173 --> 01:28:18.834
Five!

01:28:49.505 --> 01:28:51.097
Boxcars!

01:29:07.223 --> 01:29:08.247
Five!

01:29:09.825 --> 01:29:12.851
- Are you in for the convention?
- What?

01:29:55.638 --> 01:29:58.072
You're making me really hot.

01:30:56.966 --> 01:31:01.767
Perhaps I could crash on the couch
for a few hours and then leave.

01:31:01.837 --> 01:31:03.395
Get out.

01:31:54.357 --> 01:31:57.849
I was wondering
how much it would cost?

01:31:57.927 --> 01:31:59.895
Sorry, guys.
I don't know what you mean.

01:31:59.962 --> 01:32:03.398
- Anyway, I only date one guy at a time.
- Wait. We got money.

01:32:03.466 --> 01:32:05.900
Show her the fucking money.

01:32:05.968 --> 01:32:09.062
- How much are you willing to spend?
- How much do you want?

01:32:09.138 --> 01:32:11.572
Two hundred for an hour?

01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:14.268
- Don't your friends talk?
- Sure.

01:32:23.753 --> 01:32:26.221
- Get this on camera.
- Smile.

01:32:31.727 --> 01:32:33.854
- How you doin'?
- I'm fine.

01:32:33.963 --> 01:32:37.160
- Do you want something to drink?
- I'm fine. Where's the money?

01:32:37.266 --> 01:32:38.699
Money.

01:32:41.504 --> 01:32:43.267
Twenty, forty, sixty,
eighty, a hundred.

01:32:43.339 --> 01:32:46.365
- Get it on camera, dude.
- Two hundred dollars.

01:32:49.412 --> 01:32:52.745
- All right, who's first?
- Hold on a second.

01:32:52.815 --> 01:32:55.750
Miser! You've gotta get him
on camera when he comes out.

01:32:55.818 --> 01:32:58.548
- Come on.
- Look, you two go downstairs.

01:32:58.621 --> 01:33:00.555
I'll be half an hour
and then...

01:33:00.623 --> 01:33:02.955
The only thing is,
we really wanna get him on tape.

01:33:03.025 --> 01:33:05.186
This is his first time.
Come on, Miser!

01:33:05.294 --> 01:33:07.762
We just wanna see him.

01:33:19.175 --> 01:33:23.908
- Ask her the question, man.
- Ask her. Come on, ask her.

01:33:25.381 --> 01:33:29.249
- I wanna fuck you up the butt.
- Nobody's doing any of that.

01:33:29.318 --> 01:33:32.583
You're all going straight,
one at a time, and then I'm outta here.

01:33:32.655 --> 01:33:34.088
- You hear me?
- Ask again.

01:33:34.156 --> 01:33:37.557
- How much to fuck you up the butt?
- He said it again!

01:33:37.626 --> 01:33:41.084
- I wanna fuck you up the butt.
- Fuck one of your friends in the butt.

01:33:42.298 --> 01:33:46.234
- I'm outta here.
- Wait. What did she say?

01:33:46.335 --> 01:33:48.428
- Get out of my fuckin' way.
- What did you say? Hold on.

01:33:48.504 --> 01:33:51.871
- Get the fuck out of my way!
- Don't fuckin' push me!

01:33:52.975 --> 01:33:55.773
What the fuck is your problem?

01:33:57.746 --> 01:34:01.182
Look, I'm really sorry, guys.
Let's just calm down.

01:34:01.250 --> 01:34:03.810
I'm sorry.
Just calm down.

01:34:07.423 --> 01:34:11.189
- Fuck, Miser.
- Shit.

01:34:13.329 --> 01:34:14.796
- Shit.
- Fuck.

01:35:04.046 --> 01:35:05.479
Where you headed?

01:35:05.548 --> 01:35:08.016
421 Vista.

01:35:10.553 --> 01:35:14.546
I couldn't help but notice
you had a little trouble sittin' down.

01:35:14.623 --> 01:35:17.683
You get a back door delivery
you weren't expectin'?

01:35:21.096 --> 01:35:24.361
You gonna be able
to pay for this?

01:35:24.433 --> 01:35:28.369
I asked you a question.
You got money?

01:35:29.605 --> 01:35:33.200
- I'll let you out here, sister.
- I have money.

01:35:33.275 --> 01:35:37.541
All right.
Don't take it out on me.

01:35:37.646 --> 01:35:40.410
I'm just covering my ass.

01:35:40.482 --> 01:35:43.076
Somethin' maybe you should have
thought about doing.

01:35:59.134 --> 01:36:01.227
Get her, Miser.

01:36:01.303 --> 01:36:02.736
Here, I got her.

01:36:08.744 --> 01:36:10.336
Fuckin' bite me.

01:36:33.636 --> 01:36:36.298
- Who is it?
- Mrs. Van Houten.

01:36:45.214 --> 01:36:49.310
I am sorry, but we have to ask you
to be out by the end of the week.

01:38:17.172 --> 01:38:20.073
I'm sorry, ma'am.
He hasn't checked back in.

01:38:42.030 --> 01:38:45.659
What is your problem?
You're on strike?

01:39:02.985 --> 01:39:04.418
Out.

01:39:05.821 --> 01:39:08.119
What's the problem?

01:39:08.190 --> 01:39:11.887
We don't want you in here.
That's the problem.

01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:13.894
Come on. Let's go.

01:39:13.962 --> 01:39:17.898
Let go of my arm.
If you want me outta here...

01:39:17.966 --> 01:39:21.402
- I don't wanna be outta here.
- You're going out.

01:39:24.807 --> 01:39:27.901
Next time it won't be
so fuckin' easy.

01:40:01.109 --> 01:40:05.808
It ain't none of my business,
but what in the hell happened to you?

01:40:05.914 --> 01:40:10.578
I had an argument.

01:40:10.652 --> 01:40:12.882
Must have been
a hell of an argument.

01:40:12.955 --> 01:40:15.253
If I was you, I'd leave him.

01:40:15.324 --> 01:40:17.224
A pretty,
young lady like you...

01:40:18.493 --> 01:40:22.156
You can get any man you want.
Don't you know that?

01:40:56.265 --> 01:40:58.699
Where the fuck are you?

01:41:03.939 --> 01:41:06.373
Give me the address.

01:41:50.385 --> 01:41:52.478
It's so dark in here.

01:42:11.239 --> 01:42:14.072
You're so sick...

01:42:14.142 --> 01:42:15.837
so pale.

01:42:17.913 --> 01:42:19.847
My love.

01:42:21.083 --> 01:42:23.017
You're my love.

01:42:27.422 --> 01:42:29.822
Do you want help?

01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:38.365
Do you want my help?

01:42:42.437 --> 01:42:44.871
I want to see you.

01:42:47.943 --> 01:42:50.537
You're my angel.

01:42:52.047 --> 01:42:53.981
I'm right here.

01:43:02.357 --> 01:43:04.291
What happened?

01:43:07.896 --> 01:43:12.333
Something went wrong,
but I'm okay.

01:43:15.904 --> 01:43:18.998
I'm sorry I put us asunder.

01:43:19.074 --> 01:43:20.507
It's okay.

01:44:00.215 --> 01:44:02.149
Let me do it.

01:44:07.389 --> 01:44:11.291
There. There you go.

01:44:20.235 --> 01:44:23.500
See how hard
you make me, angel?

01:45:02.210 --> 01:45:04.201
You know I love you.

01:45:11.052 --> 01:45:12.542
I know.

01:45:49.724 --> 01:45:51.658
I love you.

01:46:51.152 --> 01:46:54.519
I think the thing is...

01:46:54.589 --> 01:46:58.491
we both realized that
we didn't have that much time...

01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:01.495
and...

01:47:01.596 --> 01:47:06.659
I accepted him for who he was.

01:47:08.336 --> 01:47:11.499
I didn't expect him to change.

01:47:11.573 --> 01:47:16.237
I think he felt that for me too.

01:47:19.114 --> 01:47:21.241
I liked his drama.

01:47:24.452 --> 01:47:26.386
And he needed me.

01:47:29.858 --> 01:47:31.792
I loved him.
