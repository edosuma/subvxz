00:08.408 --> 00:12.410
<i>It's like
a giant strobe light...</i>

00:12.412 --> 00:13.981
<i>burning right through my eyes.</i>

00:19.020 --> 00:21.488
<i>Somehow I can still see.</i>

00:22.522 --> 00:25.059
<i>Children look like
burnt paper...</i>

00:26.928 --> 00:28.328
<i>black...</i>

00:29.197 --> 00:30.697
<i>not moving.</i>

00:32.665 --> 00:34.768
<i>And then
the blast wave hits them.</i>

00:39.439 --> 00:42.076
<i>And they fly apart
like leaves.</i>

00:43.677 --> 00:46.045
<i>Dreams of the end of the world</i>

00:46.047 --> 00:47.114
<i>are very common.</i>

00:50.852 --> 00:53.888
<i>It's not a dream,
you moron. It's real.</i>

00:55.156 --> 00:56.822
<i>I know the date it happens.</i>

00:56.824 --> 00:59.225
<i>I'm sure
it feels very real to you.</i>

00:59.227 --> 01:01.626
<i>On August 29th, 1997,</i>

01:01.628 --> 01:05.164
<i>it's gonna feel pretty fuckin'
real to you, too!</i>

01:05.166 --> 01:09.467
<i>Anybody not wearing two million
sunblock is gonna have a real bad day.</i>

01:09.469 --> 01:11.070
- <i>Get it?</i>
- <i>Sarah...</i>

01:11.072 --> 01:14.139
<i>God, you think
you're safe and alive?</i>

01:14.141 --> 01:16.308
<i>You're already dead.
Everybody.</i>

01:16.310 --> 01:18.911
<i>Him, you!
You're dead already!</i>

01:18.913 --> 01:21.814
<i>This whole place,
everything you see is gone!</i>

01:21.816 --> 01:24.515
<i>You're the one
living in a fucking dream!</i>

01:24.517 --> 01:27.621
<i>'Cause I know it happened!
It happened!</i>

02:10.430 --> 02:12.364
<i>There once was a future</i>

02:12.366 --> 02:15.334
<i>in which humankind
was hunted...</i>

02:15.336 --> 02:18.337
<i>by a machine
that could think...</i>

02:18.339 --> 02:20.540
<i>and Terminators built to kill.</i>

02:23.110 --> 02:25.578
<i>A future without hope.</i>

02:51.839 --> 02:55.675
<i>That future never
happened because I stopped it...</i>

02:59.579 --> 03:01.548
... <i>to protect my son...</i>

03:03.451 --> 03:05.219
<i>and to save us all.</i>

03:23.838 --> 03:25.039
No!

03:26.007 --> 03:27.406
No!

03:54.734 --> 03:55.735
No.

03:56.470 --> 03:57.836
No!

03:57.838 --> 04:01.242
<i>Once I saved
three billion lives...</i>

04:01.942 --> 04:02.808
John!

04:02.810 --> 04:04.877
<i>...but I couldn't save my son.</i>

04:04.879 --> 04:06.311
John!

04:06.313 --> 04:08.883
<i>A machine took him from me.</i>

04:11.452 --> 04:13.888
<i>And I am terminated.</i>

05:38.738 --> 05:40.141
Are you okay?

06:06.600 --> 06:07.866
Okay, okay, okay.

07:14.734 --> 07:15.801
Thanks, lady.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.938
You just saved our asses.

07:36.223 --> 07:37.788
Don't thank me yet.

08:34.481 --> 08:37.716
Hey, little brother.
Good morning.

08:37.717 --> 08:39.684
I brought tamales and atole.

08:46.427 --> 08:49.861
Well, if you want to
be big in America, you would say...?

08:51.865 --> 08:54.468
I'm going to
pass Bruno Mars...

08:55.736 --> 08:56.803
pronto?

08:56.805 --> 08:58.005
Good.

08:59.573 --> 09:01.075
- Let's go.
- Okay.

09:08.182 --> 09:09.183
Uh-huh.

09:24.565 --> 09:27.034
Let's go, Diego.
We're running late.

10:02.169 --> 10:04.636
- I had something going there.
- Yeah.

10:04.638 --> 10:06.204
- I saw it.
- Come on.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.939
You think I was
flirting with her too much?

10:07.941 --> 10:10.976
I think all the parts where
you were talking were too much.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.347
Funny.

11:43.604 --> 11:44.871
Dani?

11:44.873 --> 11:46.173
Mmm-hmm.

12:04.591 --> 12:05.626
Hey, hey, hey!

12:14.067 --> 12:15.736
There's a new guy
at my station.

12:16.938 --> 12:18.305
I see that.

12:19.706 --> 12:20.806
Robot.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.380
<i>Senor</i> Sanchez,
what's going on?

12:30.885 --> 12:32.085
Diego...

12:34.054 --> 12:35.186
<i>Si.</i>

12:35.188 --> 12:37.155
I'll go.

12:37.157 --> 12:39.791
- Take my spot.
- No, no, no.

12:48.535 --> 12:49.536
Dani Ramos.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.177
How's the game?

13:19.901 --> 13:23.002
Please, Mr. Grummond.
It's my brother.

13:23.004 --> 13:25.372
But, Dani,
he ain't you.

13:26.975 --> 13:28.208
What's next?

13:28.977 --> 13:30.977
3,000 people out there.

13:30.979 --> 13:32.277
What happens if I tell them

13:32.279 --> 13:34.548
they're just keeping a
spot warm for some machine?

14:42.549 --> 14:44.482
That is not your father.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.986
That is a machine that was
sent here to kill you.

14:46.988 --> 14:49.055
- Let me go!
- You come with me

14:49.057 --> 14:51.456
or you're dead
in the next 30 seconds.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.424
Come on.

15:06.074 --> 15:07.305
Who are you?

15:07.307 --> 15:08.943
I'm the person
saving your life.

15:31.631 --> 15:32.666
Dani!

16:02.230 --> 16:03.430
Go, Dani.

16:06.366 --> 16:07.768
Stay behind me!

16:33.627 --> 16:34.829
Hey, lady!

16:41.768 --> 16:43.135
Grace.

16:44.437 --> 16:45.739
My name is Grace.

16:46.306 --> 16:47.372
That won't kill it.

16:47.374 --> 16:48.874
- We gotta go. Move!
- What?

16:48.876 --> 16:49.911
- Go!
- Diego!

16:52.146 --> 16:53.813
To where?

16:53.815 --> 16:55.315
Keep going!

16:57.819 --> 16:58.820
Come on!

17:00.754 --> 17:01.755
Here. This way.

17:05.126 --> 17:06.560
Come on!

17:06.993 --> 17:07.994
Hey!

17:08.296 --> 17:09.359
Please!

17:09.362 --> 17:11.063
Can you tell us
what that thing is?

17:11.065 --> 17:13.031
It's a Terminator. A Rev-9.

17:13.034 --> 17:15.069
He was sent here
from the future. I was, too.

17:15.734 --> 17:16.902
Get in.

17:16.904 --> 17:17.970
Get in!

17:24.311 --> 17:25.978
Are you a machine, too?

17:25.980 --> 17:27.246
No, I'm human like you.

17:27.248 --> 17:29.281
But, uh, your arm...

17:29.283 --> 17:31.516
I'm augmented.

17:31.518 --> 17:32.954
- What?
- Augmented?

17:40.895 --> 17:42.928
Fuck! Shit!

17:47.734 --> 17:49.937
Oh, shit.

17:53.241 --> 17:54.809
No!

18:04.352 --> 18:05.552
Faster! Go faster!

18:22.236 --> 18:25.472
I know you're scared,
but I am here to protect you.

18:26.107 --> 18:27.108
Why us?

18:29.542 --> 18:32.211
You, Dani.
You're my mission.

18:32.213 --> 18:33.413
Me?

18:35.283 --> 18:36.483
No, no, no!

18:48.996 --> 18:49.997
Look out!

19:23.297 --> 19:24.832
Go faster! Go faster!

19:54.161 --> 19:56.063
Fuck!

20:04.205 --> 20:05.206
No! No!

20:08.442 --> 20:09.642
Oh, my God!

20:11.778 --> 20:13.780
No!

20:14.949 --> 20:16.482
Drive!

20:16.484 --> 20:18.549
- What?
- Can you drive?

20:18.551 --> 20:20.518
- No, I mean, I can't...
- I can! I can!

20:20.520 --> 20:21.788
Yeah.

20:24.091 --> 20:25.792
Hold it. Grace...

20:26.626 --> 20:28.528
Dani, put your seat belt on.

22:16.636 --> 22:17.702
Diego...

22:24.011 --> 22:26.278
Grace! Help me!

22:26.280 --> 22:27.714
It's Diego!

22:29.450 --> 22:31.116
Please! Take him out.

22:31.118 --> 22:32.119
Dani.

22:33.387 --> 22:34.486
I can't.

22:34.488 --> 22:36.321
What? No, no!

22:36.323 --> 22:38.323
Don't. He will bleed out.

22:46.733 --> 22:48.035
<i>Senor?</i>

22:51.071 --> 22:52.439
Diego.

22:54.542 --> 22:57.178
- Dani, we have to go.
- I'm not leaving him.

22:58.245 --> 22:59.914
Take her. Save her.

23:02.650 --> 23:03.949
- No!
- I'm sorry.

23:03.951 --> 23:04.952
Please!

23:20.134 --> 23:21.366
No.

23:21.368 --> 23:22.834
- Diego!
- Dani!

23:26.840 --> 23:28.706
Dani! Dani, stop!

23:28.708 --> 23:30.108
Why did you do that?

23:30.110 --> 23:33.178
We have to go,
or he died for nothing.

23:33.180 --> 23:34.481
- No.
- Come on.

23:35.249 --> 23:36.283
Diego!

24:15.389 --> 24:16.390
Oh, shit.

24:24.632 --> 24:26.865
When they start
to kill me, run.

24:26.867 --> 24:28.135
What?

25:14.348 --> 25:15.747
I'll be back.

25:23.891 --> 25:25.159
Who the fuck is that?

25:26.427 --> 25:27.428
I don't know.

25:28.629 --> 25:29.863
But we have to move.

25:32.232 --> 25:33.598
Go.

25:33.600 --> 25:34.835
We can't just...

25:35.869 --> 25:36.935
Grace, it's that lady's car.

25:36.937 --> 25:38.437
Dani, you go
or it kills you.

25:38.439 --> 25:39.573
It's that simple.

25:48.349 --> 25:49.383
Son of a bitch!

25:56.523 --> 25:57.524
Dani...

25:59.393 --> 26:00.394
I need some water.

26:01.495 --> 26:04.365
If we can
maybe look in the back.

26:06.900 --> 26:09.136
I wanna go home.

26:09.636 --> 26:10.637
Take me home.

26:11.538 --> 26:12.873
We're not doing that.

26:13.907 --> 26:16.243
I have to tell my father
about Diego.

26:16.877 --> 26:17.943
It's not possible.

26:17.945 --> 26:19.644
He doesn't know
about Diego.

26:19.646 --> 26:21.079
I need to see my father!

26:21.081 --> 26:22.549
Your father is dead.

26:24.551 --> 26:25.552
What?

26:26.487 --> 26:29.356
It needs physical contact
to copy people.

26:30.090 --> 26:32.159
And they don't survive.

26:34.361 --> 26:35.362
No.

26:36.831 --> 26:37.896
No.

26:59.787 --> 27:00.988
What's wrong with you?

27:02.790 --> 27:03.991
I'm crashing.

27:06.560 --> 27:07.561
You're burning up.

27:08.629 --> 27:13.400
My metabolism was tuned
for short, intense bursts.

27:15.169 --> 27:18.038
You either stop a Terminator
in the first few minutes...

27:19.406 --> 27:20.674
or you're dead.

27:23.912 --> 27:25.279
I need meds.

27:28.715 --> 27:31.185
Hey!

27:31.920 --> 27:33.318
Grace!

27:33.320 --> 27:34.321
Wake up!

27:52.506 --> 27:53.707
Where are you going?

27:54.741 --> 27:56.343
Get back in the car.

27:58.979 --> 28:00.481
I have to protect you.

28:03.517 --> 28:04.685
You can't even walk.

28:05.887 --> 28:07.354
I'm going to the police.

28:08.689 --> 28:12.224
You do that,
it'll find you.

28:12.226 --> 28:15.629
You put a hundred cops between
you and a Terminator...

28:17.130 --> 28:19.266
you'll get
a hundred dead cops.

28:22.904 --> 28:24.605
Dani, please.

28:38.118 --> 28:40.552
Wait. Come here.

28:40.554 --> 28:43.423
- You said you can't drive.
- Yeah.

28:43.958 --> 28:45.425
I'll figure it out.

29:07.381 --> 29:08.382
Hey!

29:10.617 --> 29:11.884
Hey!

29:11.886 --> 29:13.184
Grace, Grace!

29:13.186 --> 29:15.355
It's okay. We're here.

29:16.223 --> 29:17.424
Fuck, you're heavy.

29:21.528 --> 29:22.529
We're here.

29:26.968 --> 29:28.168
Grace.

29:40.547 --> 29:43.348
I need any anticonvulsant.

29:43.350 --> 29:47.421
Sodium polystyrene sulfonate,
insulin, benzodiazepine...

29:48.488 --> 29:50.457
Do you have
a doctor's prescription?

29:52.359 --> 29:53.960
Here's my prescription.

29:53.962 --> 29:55.228
What are you doing?

29:56.864 --> 29:58.231
Fuck it.

29:58.699 --> 29:59.700
Move.

30:18.619 --> 30:19.786
It's okay.

30:21.254 --> 30:22.824
Grace.

30:24.658 --> 30:25.659
Grace.

30:26.793 --> 30:27.794
Grace?

30:43.610 --> 30:44.611
Grace.

31:04.032 --> 31:05.232
I save your ass...

31:06.400 --> 31:09.169
and you steal my truck.
Nice.

31:09.904 --> 31:10.905
I...

31:12.907 --> 31:14.876
Never mind. It's burnt.

31:15.977 --> 31:17.310
What's wrong with her?

31:18.079 --> 31:19.444
I don't know.

31:19.446 --> 31:22.114
She's sick or something.

31:22.116 --> 31:23.918
Well, I need answers
from you two.

31:24.518 --> 31:26.219
So let's get her in the car.

31:27.354 --> 31:29.523
Give me that
before you hurt yourself.

31:38.198 --> 31:40.802
So, who are you?

31:43.270 --> 31:45.272
Um, Daniella Ramos.

31:46.773 --> 31:47.774
Dani.

31:49.177 --> 31:50.775
I'm nobody.

31:50.777 --> 31:54.548
Well, Dani, you must be somebody,
or they wouldn't have sent...

31:55.582 --> 31:57.852
whatever she is
to protect you.

32:00.387 --> 32:02.456
Hey, you got a phone?

32:04.257 --> 32:06.660
- Yes.
- Could I see it for a sec?

32:12.432 --> 32:13.331
Hey!

32:14.768 --> 32:16.904
Might as well be
wearing a tracking bracelet.

32:18.139 --> 32:19.805
When I'm ready
to kill that thing,

32:19.807 --> 32:21.775
then I'll let it know
where we are.

32:29.217 --> 32:31.018
We should have done this
in the bathtub.

32:32.153 --> 32:33.855
Have you seen the bathtub?

32:40.527 --> 32:41.659
Uh-uh.

32:41.661 --> 32:44.196
I keep my cell phone
in the chip bag.

32:44.198 --> 32:47.099
The foil blocks
the GPS signal

32:47.101 --> 32:48.535
so they can't track me.

32:50.104 --> 32:51.538
Who's trying to track you?

32:52.472 --> 32:54.574
I'm wanted
in a couple of states.

32:55.408 --> 32:56.978
50, actually.

32:59.746 --> 33:01.348
But why 10 bags?

33:02.183 --> 33:04.651
Because I really like
potato chips.

33:12.459 --> 33:13.660
Her meds...

33:14.795 --> 33:16.931
how do you know
how much of each to use?

33:18.132 --> 33:19.432
I don't.

33:40.654 --> 33:42.589
No one will know
who he is.

33:43.757 --> 33:44.758
Who?

33:50.832 --> 33:51.933
My brother.

33:53.167 --> 33:54.634
He was in the truck when...

34:03.277 --> 34:05.079
Who will be there
to bury him?

34:07.915 --> 34:09.416
Or my father?

34:12.820 --> 34:14.021
No funerals.

34:15.655 --> 34:17.824
No one there to say goodbye.

34:21.062 --> 34:22.728
Funerals don't help them.

34:25.032 --> 34:27.800
And goodbyes don't help you.

34:27.802 --> 34:30.469
You just have to learn
to live with it.

34:34.474 --> 34:35.773
<i>Come in, base.</i>

34:35.775 --> 34:39.013
<i>This is Dragonfly Three
requesting close air support.</i>

34:39.646 --> 34:40.980
We are five klicks out,

34:40.982 --> 34:44.049
carrying wounded
precious cargo. Over.

34:44.051 --> 34:46.451
<i>Roger that, Dragonfly Three.</i>

34:46.453 --> 34:49.522
<i>Be advised there are hostiles
inbound on vector five.</i>

34:53.560 --> 34:57.495
The trauma crew is standing by for
the commander at the south tunnel.

34:57.497 --> 35:00.533
We have Rev-7s in pursuit.
Weapons free.

35:21.755 --> 35:22.888
Let's move!

35:22.890 --> 35:24.658
We got 30 seconds.

35:26.493 --> 35:28.996
- Get off there now! Move back!
- Go!

35:31.832 --> 35:33.134
Incoming!

35:55.389 --> 35:57.022
You get
the commander inside.

35:57.024 --> 35:58.891
Okay.

35:58.893 --> 36:01.561
You three, with me!
Hold them back!

36:03.663 --> 36:05.699
Come on!

36:08.302 --> 36:09.502
Look out!

36:34.328 --> 36:38.265
We're being overrun!
We need reinforcements now!

36:42.635 --> 36:44.205
Cover her!

36:50.510 --> 36:51.912
Move! Coming in!

36:52.413 --> 36:53.544
Shit!

36:53.546 --> 36:55.447
She's got multiple
stab wounds.

36:55.449 --> 36:56.815
A lot of chest trauma here.

36:56.817 --> 36:58.484
Let's get these
holes sealed up.

36:58.486 --> 36:59.650
Get a chest tube
in the right side.

36:59.652 --> 37:00.953
This is gonna hurt
like a motherfucker.

37:00.955 --> 37:02.021
Wait, wait.

37:02.023 --> 37:03.057
No!

37:04.524 --> 37:07.226
- Here.
- No, no!

37:07.228 --> 37:09.761
I need to protect
your commander.

37:09.763 --> 37:11.096
The commander is safe,
thanks to you.

37:11.098 --> 37:13.200
Don't worry, soldier.
You'll make it.

37:13.633 --> 37:15.234
I volunteer.

37:15.236 --> 37:16.703
Make me an Augment.

37:23.743 --> 37:26.845
Midline sternotomy
with manubrial splitting.

37:26.847 --> 37:29.950
Lung deflation
and cardiac localization.

37:31.252 --> 37:33.318
Okay, let's gear up.

37:34.654 --> 37:35.954
Sarah?

37:35.956 --> 37:36.957
Talk.

37:38.558 --> 37:39.860
Talk fast.

37:43.264 --> 37:44.331
You first.

37:47.468 --> 37:48.766
Get off me.

37:53.507 --> 37:54.707
Sarah!

38:00.613 --> 38:02.950
Hey, Sarah!
Open the door.

38:04.651 --> 38:05.853
Dani!

38:06.719 --> 38:08.120
- You okay?
- Yeah, you okay?

38:08.122 --> 38:09.488
Yeah.

38:09.490 --> 38:10.690
What happened?

38:11.392 --> 38:13.591
Locked me
out of the room?

38:13.593 --> 38:17.965
Sometimes mommies and daddies
have to have grown-up discussions.

38:21.502 --> 38:23.270
So you're here
to protect her.

38:24.604 --> 38:26.505
What are you?

38:26.507 --> 38:28.309
Never seen one
like you before.

38:29.043 --> 38:30.675
Almost human.

38:30.677 --> 38:32.113
I am human.

38:33.047 --> 38:34.313
Just enhanced.

38:34.315 --> 38:36.614
You know,
increased speed and strength,

38:36.616 --> 38:38.117
thorium micro-reactor.

38:38.119 --> 38:39.818
Which means I can
rip your throat out

38:39.820 --> 38:41.589
if you piss me off,
so don't.

38:43.457 --> 38:45.025
When are you from?

38:45.559 --> 38:46.894
2042.

38:47.627 --> 38:48.863
Your turn.

39:05.846 --> 39:07.948
My name is Sarah Connor.

39:09.782 --> 39:11.649
When I was about her age...

39:11.651 --> 39:14.553
a Terminator
was sent to kill me...

39:14.555 --> 39:16.824
to stop the birth
of my son, John.

39:17.657 --> 39:19.659
Leader of the Resistance.

39:20.227 --> 39:21.692
Which resistance?

39:21.694 --> 39:23.864
The human resistance.

39:24.465 --> 39:25.933
Against Skynet?

39:27.734 --> 39:30.735
The AI that's trying
to wipe us all out?

39:30.737 --> 39:32.306
I've never heard of it.

39:34.074 --> 39:35.176
Good.

39:35.943 --> 39:37.677
John and I changed that.

39:38.479 --> 39:39.980
We changed the future.

39:40.648 --> 39:42.749
Saved three billion lives.

39:46.453 --> 39:48.088
You're welcome.

39:51.392 --> 39:52.826
Where's your son now?

40:01.101 --> 40:04.405
Skynet had sent several
Terminators to hunt him.

40:07.575 --> 40:09.810
One finally caught up
with us...

40:13.214 --> 40:17.784
and carried out orders from
a future that never happened.

40:20.821 --> 40:22.056
Since then...

40:23.424 --> 40:25.426
I hunt Terminators.

40:28.462 --> 40:31.065
And I drink till I black out.

40:32.032 --> 40:34.001
Enough of a resume for you?

40:36.303 --> 40:37.936
No.

40:37.938 --> 40:40.205
How did you know
we'd be on that freeway?

40:40.207 --> 40:42.742
Interview's over.
We gotta move.

40:43.477 --> 40:44.478
We?

40:45.412 --> 40:46.744
There is no "we."

40:46.746 --> 40:49.414
Dani's with me.
It's my mission to protect her.

40:49.416 --> 40:50.482
Oh, yeah?

40:50.484 --> 40:52.186
How's that working out
for you?

40:54.388 --> 40:57.089
Clearly you don't know
everything about this time.

40:57.091 --> 41:00.959
How anyone with a phone
is a walking sensor platform.

41:00.961 --> 41:03.629
How every intersection,
every gas station

41:03.631 --> 41:05.697
and 7-Eleven has cameras.

41:05.699 --> 41:07.065
Nobody walks
through this world

41:07.067 --> 41:09.334
without leaving a digital
trail a mile wide.

41:09.336 --> 41:12.838
And my guess is that
Terminator hunting her...

41:12.840 --> 41:15.242
can access that data
anytime.

41:21.415 --> 41:23.350
You two won't last 10 hours.

41:38.666 --> 41:39.831
Let's get
something straight.

41:39.833 --> 41:42.934
If you put her in danger
or you get in my way,

41:42.936 --> 41:45.005
I will fuck you up.

41:46.440 --> 41:47.441
Right.

41:48.175 --> 41:49.376
I drive.

41:52.513 --> 41:54.181
So, that machine...

41:54.848 --> 41:56.050
who sent it?

41:58.018 --> 41:59.718
I can't fight it
if I don't know

41:59.720 --> 42:01.155
what we're up against.

42:01.889 --> 42:03.490
It's a Rev-9 model.

42:04.491 --> 42:06.391
You don't fight it.

42:06.393 --> 42:07.859
You run from it.

42:07.861 --> 42:09.430
Yeah, but who sent it?

42:10.130 --> 42:11.165
Not who.

42:11.899 --> 42:14.001
What. And it wasn't some...

42:15.369 --> 42:16.301
Skynet thing.

42:16.303 --> 42:18.572
In the future
that actually happened...

42:19.406 --> 42:20.407
it's called Legion.

42:20.741 --> 42:21.808
Legion.

42:21.810 --> 42:24.042
An AI built
for cyber warfare.

42:24.044 --> 42:27.612
Those assholes
never learn.

42:27.614 --> 42:29.081
And it attacked.

42:29.083 --> 42:30.918
- Attacked who?
- Us.

42:31.919 --> 42:33.487
Everybody. Humanity.

42:37.458 --> 42:41.362
Sarah, how did you know
we would be on that bridge?

42:46.835 --> 42:48.133
I get these texts.

42:48.135 --> 42:51.703
Precise GPS coordinates,
dates, times,

42:51.705 --> 42:53.305
down to the second.

42:53.307 --> 42:55.943
They always end
with the same two words.

42:57.812 --> 42:59.846
"For John."

42:59.848 --> 43:02.581
So I pack up
every weapon I've got,

43:02.583 --> 43:04.149
and I head
to those coordinates

43:04.151 --> 43:07.119
to kill whoever
is messing with me.

43:07.121 --> 43:10.188
The air splits open
above a parking lot

43:10.190 --> 43:13.093
and a Terminator drops out.

43:14.728 --> 43:16.829
So I destroy it.

43:16.831 --> 43:19.664
And then two years later,
same thing.

43:19.666 --> 43:23.535
Location, time, date,
"For John."

43:23.537 --> 43:25.038
I frag that one, too.

43:26.173 --> 43:29.141
And last week,
I get two texts,

43:29.143 --> 43:31.076
both in Mexico City.

43:31.078 --> 43:33.378
Did you ever find out
who sends those texts?

43:33.380 --> 43:36.816
No. They're
always encrypted.

43:36.818 --> 43:38.485
Do you still have them
on your phone?

43:39.319 --> 43:40.320
Dani.

43:49.596 --> 43:50.662
What are you doing?

43:50.664 --> 43:52.032
Future shit.

43:57.004 --> 43:58.570
What's wrong? What is it?

43:58.572 --> 44:01.542
These texts
came from outside Laredo.

44:03.010 --> 44:05.043
Two days ago,

44:05.045 --> 44:08.079
my commander had them tattoo
these coordinates on me.

44:08.081 --> 44:09.614
As if I couldn't
remember shit.

44:09.616 --> 44:10.917
Told me to go here in case

44:10.919 --> 44:12.486
anything went sideways
with my mission.

44:14.421 --> 44:16.490
It's the same location
your texts come from.

44:17.458 --> 44:20.125
Whoever sent you these texts
is the same person

44:20.127 --> 44:21.728
I was told to go to for help.

44:23.130 --> 44:24.763
What does it mean?

44:24.765 --> 44:26.567
It means
we're going to Texas.

44:27.936 --> 44:29.768
You wanna cross
the U.S. border

44:29.770 --> 44:32.237
with an undocumented
Mexican national

44:32.239 --> 44:34.539
and a woman who had
her own episode

44:34.541 --> 44:36.541
on <i>America's Most Wanted?</i>

44:36.543 --> 44:38.612
I know someone
who can get us across.

44:40.915 --> 44:42.115
Someone you trust?

44:42.917 --> 44:44.751
Yes. My uncle.

44:46.153 --> 44:47.588
Well, we need
to ditch the car.

44:48.121 --> 44:49.590
Get off the grid.

45:15.415 --> 45:17.351
Why do you care
what happens to her?

45:18.619 --> 45:19.720
Hey, ladies.

45:23.524 --> 45:24.891
Because I was her.

45:24.893 --> 45:26.591
And it sucks.

45:26.593 --> 45:28.161
Let's go.

45:39.139 --> 45:41.341
Well, this is
off the grid, all right.

45:42.376 --> 45:45.176
But I wish it wasn't
so crowded here.

45:45.178 --> 45:47.447
Well, I wish you two
weren't so white.

45:55.255 --> 45:56.590
Let's go, <i>chicas.</i>

46:12.573 --> 46:13.707
<i>Gracias.</i>

47:13.200 --> 47:15.837
Grace,
tell me what happens

47:17.237 --> 47:19.139
when this all falls apart.

47:23.276 --> 47:24.678
Nothing happens.

47:27.015 --> 47:28.981
There's no warning.

47:28.983 --> 47:30.852
Day one,
everything just stops.

47:32.419 --> 47:34.788
No phones, no power.
Cities go dark.

47:36.024 --> 47:37.658
Grace, stay there.

47:38.826 --> 47:40.193
<i>They told us</i>

47:41.662 --> 47:42.830
<i>we had to leave,</i>

47:44.631 --> 47:46.667
<i>just until things
got back to normal.</i>

48:02.616 --> 48:05.252
But normal
was never coming back.

48:08.522 --> 48:10.056
Day two,

48:10.058 --> 48:11.523
they launched nukes.

48:11.525 --> 48:13.458
They thought they could
contain Legion

48:13.460 --> 48:15.930
with tactical EMP strikes.

48:20.500 --> 48:22.937
And by day three,
the whole world was at war.

48:27.175 --> 48:28.608
Millions died.

48:29.342 --> 48:32.477
And then,
when the food ran out,

48:32.479 --> 48:33.480
billions.

48:39.219 --> 48:42.355
Some men killed my dad
over a can of peaches.

48:45.059 --> 48:46.691
I'm sorry.

48:46.693 --> 48:48.293
When we thought
the worst was over,

48:48.295 --> 48:51.531
then Legion started
to hunt survivors.

49:30.470 --> 49:32.171
We know
you got food, kid.

49:32.173 --> 49:33.373
Give it up.

49:42.749 --> 49:47.153
I don't know how I made it
through the next few years.

49:47.155 --> 49:48.990
I just try
not to think about it.

49:50.958 --> 49:52.359
But I got lucky.

49:53.060 --> 49:54.427
Someone found me,

49:56.797 --> 49:57.965
saved me,

49:59.733 --> 50:03.836
and then we started
fighting back.

50:03.838 --> 50:05.305
And let me guess.

50:07.507 --> 50:11.578
Dani gives birth to the
one man that can stop it.

50:14.447 --> 50:17.149
- What?
- The future wants you dead

50:17.151 --> 50:20.052
for the same reason
it wanted me dead.

50:20.054 --> 50:22.254
But I'm nothing.
I'm nobody.

50:22.256 --> 50:23.891
Yeah, you're
not the threat.

50:26.961 --> 50:28.495
It's your womb.

50:33.400 --> 50:35.868
Fine.
Let someone else be

50:35.870 --> 50:37.704
Mother Mary for a while.

50:38.873 --> 50:39.839
If you're Mother Mary,

50:39.841 --> 50:41.976
why do I so wanna
beat the shit outta you?

51:50.410 --> 51:51.611
Dani!

52:04.358 --> 52:06.193
My clients
get across safely.

52:06.961 --> 52:08.626
To a better life.

52:08.628 --> 52:10.930
I don't leave them
to die in the desert

52:10.932 --> 52:11.864
as some others do.

52:11.866 --> 52:14.601
Can you get us
across the border?

52:16.703 --> 52:20.540
Forgive me, but gringas
are not my usual clientele.

52:23.710 --> 52:25.980
You two do something
illegal maybe?

52:27.982 --> 52:30.583
Something my Dani
doesn't wish to say?

52:31.484 --> 52:33.453
<i>Tio,</i> there's...

52:35.256 --> 52:36.857
This is going to sound crazy,

52:37.757 --> 52:39.959
but there's a machine
out there.

52:39.961 --> 52:41.526
A robot.

52:41.528 --> 52:43.262
It's what killed
<i>Papi</i> and Diego,

52:43.264 --> 52:44.631
and it wants to kill me.

52:45.299 --> 52:46.566
We have to get away from it.

52:47.168 --> 52:48.468
That's a new one.

52:58.678 --> 53:00.580
Grace is part machine, too.

53:22.336 --> 53:23.770
This way, ladies.

53:34.048 --> 53:35.114
Hey, fellas.

53:35.116 --> 53:36.150
What's up?

53:41.889 --> 53:44.056
Ain't that just
like the Border Patrol.

53:44.058 --> 53:47.059
Five minutes late,
and neglects to bring us donuts.

53:47.061 --> 53:49.395
Terrance, shut the fuck up.

54:11.618 --> 54:13.018
<i>Griffin 33 in contact</i>

54:13.020 --> 54:15.688
<i>with intersection
due west of the Greene Bridge.</i>

54:16.689 --> 54:18.792
<i>9-11 Griffin 33 wilco.</i>

54:20.294 --> 54:23.064
<i>Griffin 33 9-11,
that is your target.</i>

54:39.646 --> 54:40.848
Almost there.

54:41.849 --> 54:43.315
One more kilometer
to the river.

54:43.317 --> 54:44.318
Wait.

54:47.021 --> 54:48.055
Take cover.

54:51.358 --> 54:52.359
There's a drone up there.

54:54.161 --> 54:55.360
I don't hear anything.

54:55.362 --> 54:57.329
Yeah, well, you're not
an augmented super soldier

54:57.331 --> 54:58.598
from the future,
are you?

55:00.167 --> 55:01.235
We have to hurry.

55:03.237 --> 55:04.702
Attention, all patrols.

55:04.704 --> 55:07.106
Be advised,
new coordinates issued.

55:07.108 --> 55:09.707
<i>Suspects are now
220 meters south</i>

55:09.709 --> 55:11.977
<i>of Checkpoint 7-Bravo.</i>

55:11.979 --> 55:15.180
<i>They are known members
of the Sinaloa Cartel.</i>

55:15.182 --> 55:19.384
<i>Wanted by American
and Mexican authorities.</i>

55:19.386 --> 55:23.023
<i>They should be considered armed and dangerous.</i>

55:23.858 --> 55:25.692
Deadly force is authorized.

55:31.165 --> 55:32.763
When you reach the wall,

55:32.765 --> 55:34.632
there's a door beneath.

55:34.634 --> 55:36.070
Flacco will
show you the way.

55:53.053 --> 55:54.321
I will go first.

56:07.234 --> 56:08.235
Oh, shit.

56:09.336 --> 56:12.471
<i>Stop! U.S. Border Patrol.</i>

56:12.473 --> 56:14.375
<i>Put your weapons
on the ground.</i>

56:15.742 --> 56:18.345
We get locked up,
it comes for her, she's dead.

56:19.980 --> 56:21.580
<i>I'm not gonna
tell you again!</i>

56:21.582 --> 56:23.184
<i>Put them on the ground!</i>

56:24.385 --> 56:25.617
Okay.

56:25.619 --> 56:27.085
Dani! Dani!

56:27.087 --> 56:29.890
They can shoot me,
but I'm not watching you die.

56:32.092 --> 56:33.325
It's okay.

56:33.327 --> 56:34.328
It's okay.

56:36.063 --> 56:38.964
If they
separate me from her,

56:38.966 --> 56:42.434
- please get her out of there.
- All right.

56:42.436 --> 56:45.372
<i>Walk forward
and away from your weapons.</i>

56:49.076 --> 56:51.744
<i>Get on the ground!</i>

57:05.059 --> 57:06.158
Get up, move it.

57:06.160 --> 57:07.828
- You get them?
- Yep.

57:19.974 --> 57:21.739
<i>We have one male suspect</i>

57:21.741 --> 57:23.844
<i>and three female suspects
in custody.</i>

57:28.716 --> 57:30.017
- Dani!
- Hey!

57:44.064 --> 57:45.299
We need help here!

58:03.350 --> 58:05.550
Sorry, but I don't
have time for this shit.

58:05.552 --> 58:07.319
And it's not my problem.

58:07.321 --> 58:09.054
I need basic information.

58:09.056 --> 58:11.857
Name, age, country of origin.

58:11.859 --> 58:15.460
It's the truth, ma'am.
I swear it.

58:15.462 --> 58:19.031
This machine, it killed
my brother and my father,

58:19.033 --> 58:20.399
and now it wants to kill me,

58:20.401 --> 58:21.933
- and he...
- Uh-huh.

58:21.935 --> 58:25.005
Please! Officer,
you have to believe me.

58:25.673 --> 58:26.874
You're in danger, too.

58:27.441 --> 58:29.510
No. I'm in Processing.

58:30.244 --> 58:31.310
You ought to
save your story

58:31.312 --> 58:33.447
till you get where
you're going, honey.

58:35.416 --> 58:37.251
Heart rate
slightly elevated.

58:39.053 --> 58:41.455
Lungs are clear.
Let's get that wound exposed.

58:42.823 --> 58:44.224
Trachea's midline.

58:45.225 --> 58:46.927
Let's check
for any exit wounds.

58:55.169 --> 58:57.037
Nice body search, fellas.

59:07.581 --> 59:09.016
What is that?

59:10.417 --> 59:11.952
I've never seen
anything like this.

59:12.686 --> 59:15.487
Let's get some pictures.

59:15.489 --> 59:17.925
<i>That's confirmed.
We have eyes on it now. Go ahead.</i>

59:19.360 --> 59:20.425
Hey.

59:20.427 --> 59:23.695
I just got TDY'd here
to pick up a new detainee.

59:23.697 --> 59:24.863
Where they being held?

59:24.865 --> 59:26.631
Check in
with the desk sergeant.

59:26.633 --> 59:29.069
- He'll direct you.
- Thank you.

59:52.559 --> 59:53.792
Evenin'.

59:53.794 --> 59:56.495
Supposed to pick up
a detainee. Dani Ramos.

59:56.497 --> 59:57.598
Please locker your weapon.

01:00:05.874 --> 01:00:07.441
What's been done to her?

01:00:08.442 --> 01:00:10.644
How is she even alive
with all this stuff in her?

01:00:13.714 --> 01:00:15.815
Expect a big ping, brother.

01:00:15.817 --> 01:00:17.215
My whole body's a weapon.

01:00:17.217 --> 01:00:19.153
Save it for the ladies.

01:00:20.621 --> 01:00:22.855
Sorry. Metal hip.

01:00:22.857 --> 01:00:24.324
Two tours in Afghanistan.

01:00:26.026 --> 01:00:27.961
All right. Thank you
for your service.

01:00:31.698 --> 01:00:32.699
Psst.

01:00:36.570 --> 01:00:37.938
Connor.

01:00:39.808 --> 01:00:41.508
Sarah Connor.

01:00:42.911 --> 01:00:44.545
I'm Officer Rigby.

01:00:45.546 --> 01:00:46.980
It's an honor.

01:00:52.519 --> 01:00:54.154
Hey, guess what.

01:00:54.955 --> 01:00:56.455
You're famous.

01:00:56.457 --> 01:00:58.659
And we don't get a lot
of famous around here.

01:01:00.394 --> 01:01:01.793
Let's go.

01:01:01.795 --> 01:01:03.997
You belong
in your own private cage.

01:01:06.099 --> 01:01:07.468
I want to go, too!

01:01:33.794 --> 01:01:35.128
Hey! Catch her!

01:01:45.572 --> 01:01:48.175
Did I say you can
look at my private parts?

01:01:50.879 --> 01:01:52.244
Where do they take
the new prisoners?

01:01:52.246 --> 01:01:54.281
They're called detainees
and we...

01:01:55.716 --> 01:01:59.251
They're taken to the south end
holding area for processing...

01:01:59.253 --> 01:02:01.288
Thanks.

01:02:40.561 --> 01:02:41.660
Right this way, ma'am.

01:02:41.662 --> 01:02:44.629
Our senior living section
is on the second floor.

01:02:47.234 --> 01:02:49.167
Hey!

01:03:21.702 --> 01:03:23.136
Grace! Grace!

01:03:24.072 --> 01:03:26.106
- You okay?
- He's here. We gotta go.

01:03:27.075 --> 01:03:29.274
Get back!
Everybody, get back!

01:04:01.608 --> 01:04:02.609
Come on.

01:04:10.183 --> 01:04:11.385
Get in!

01:04:16.991 --> 01:04:18.358
We gotta go.

01:04:20.862 --> 01:04:22.360
There's Sarah.
She's coming.

01:04:24.364 --> 01:04:25.799
- There's no time.
- What?

01:04:28.735 --> 01:04:30.370
No! I'm not leaving her!

01:04:31.738 --> 01:04:32.739
Dani!

01:04:37.678 --> 01:04:39.277
Sarah, run!

01:04:39.279 --> 01:04:40.913
- Sarah, get her!
- Get in!

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:09.041
Dani, you need
to understand something.

01:05:09.043 --> 01:05:10.878
You can't do stupid shit
like that.

01:05:11.678 --> 01:05:14.180
You cannot put yourself
at risk.

01:05:14.182 --> 01:05:16.781
- He would have killed Sarah.
- That doesn't matter!

01:05:16.783 --> 01:05:18.750
When are you gonna get it?

01:05:18.752 --> 01:05:22.422
Everybody dies
if you don't make it.

01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:31.665
She's right.

01:05:32.566 --> 01:05:33.767
What?

01:05:39.372 --> 01:05:41.339
Hey there, fellas.

01:05:41.341 --> 01:05:43.075
Y'all come
to see the shitshow?

01:05:43.077 --> 01:05:44.676
What the hell
happened here?

01:05:44.678 --> 01:05:47.113
Detainee got loose,
unlocked all the cages,

01:05:47.115 --> 01:05:48.682
just chaos from there.

01:05:49.583 --> 01:05:51.083
I don't mind tellin' you,

01:05:51.085 --> 01:05:53.653
I prayed more in five minutes
than I have my whole life.

01:05:54.122 --> 01:05:56.021
Heard that.

01:05:56.023 --> 01:05:59.894
Say, you boys know where I can
get my hands on a chopper?

01:06:07.935 --> 01:06:09.436
We're over the coordinates.

01:06:11.239 --> 01:06:12.773
Land
a klick short.

01:06:37.265 --> 01:06:39.599
So, Carl? That's the plan?

01:06:40.567 --> 01:06:42.569
Carl's the mystery texter.

01:07:08.963 --> 01:07:10.097
<i>No!</i>

01:07:10.965 --> 01:07:12.399
<i>No!</i>

01:07:14.701 --> 01:07:15.870
Sarah Connor.

01:07:17.004 --> 01:07:18.403
Sarah!

01:07:18.405 --> 01:07:21.040
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

01:07:21.042 --> 01:07:22.875
What the fuck are you doing?

01:07:22.877 --> 01:07:24.143
- Let me have it!
- No.

01:07:24.145 --> 01:07:26.312
Sarah, you need
to calm down.

01:07:26.314 --> 01:07:28.115
That thing killed John!

01:07:30.251 --> 01:07:32.019
- Is that true?
- Yes.

01:07:33.221 --> 01:07:34.452
But I'm not
what you think I am.

01:07:34.454 --> 01:07:36.856
I'll kill you,
you motherfucker!

01:07:36.858 --> 01:07:37.789
Sarah, Sarah.

01:07:37.791 --> 01:07:39.992
- If this man can help us...
- Not a man.

01:07:39.994 --> 01:07:41.861
A Terminator.

01:07:41.863 --> 01:07:44.395
Shoot him in the face
and see what's underneath!

01:07:44.397 --> 01:07:45.900
I don't care what he is!

01:07:47.767 --> 01:07:48.903
Please.

01:08:07.255 --> 01:08:09.054
- So you're a...
- Yes.

01:08:09.056 --> 01:08:11.092
Cyberdyne Systems Model 101.

01:08:12.626 --> 01:08:13.793
May I ask what you are?

01:08:14.962 --> 01:08:15.963
No.

01:08:36.384 --> 01:08:37.617
Sarah?

01:08:51.966 --> 01:08:55.136
I don't have
a photograph of John.

01:09:00.341 --> 01:09:02.143
I never took any.

01:09:07.081 --> 01:09:08.715
I thought that...

01:09:13.386 --> 01:09:14.854
they couldn't find him...

01:09:17.291 --> 01:09:19.492
if they didn't know
what he looked like.

01:09:21.929 --> 01:09:24.596
But now I'm forgetting
his face.

01:09:28.169 --> 01:09:29.569
I'm sorry.

01:09:35.508 --> 01:09:37.011
So why
is the girl targeted?

01:09:38.212 --> 01:09:40.145
You don't need to know.

01:09:40.147 --> 01:09:42.482
Well, can you at least
tell me how you found me?

01:09:50.224 --> 01:09:51.258
Who gave you that?

01:10:09.477 --> 01:10:10.710
Thanks.

01:10:20.687 --> 01:10:22.890
- Please sit down.
- Cut the shit.

01:10:30.498 --> 01:10:32.331
Nice family.

01:10:32.333 --> 01:10:34.201
She a Terminator, too?

01:10:36.569 --> 01:10:39.006
That's your
little Terminator kid?

01:10:39.507 --> 01:10:40.941
His name is Mateo.

01:10:41.541 --> 01:10:42.975
I met his mother, Alicia,

01:10:42.977 --> 01:10:45.310
a few months
after I killed John.

01:10:45.312 --> 01:10:47.281
Oh, you don't get
to say his name.

01:10:48.382 --> 01:10:49.649
Ever.

01:10:53.553 --> 01:10:55.454
Her husband
had beaten her.

01:10:55.456 --> 01:10:56.957
He was trying
to kill her child.

01:10:57.491 --> 01:10:58.959
She had nowhere to go.

01:11:00.394 --> 01:11:02.961
Caring for this family
gave me purpose.

01:11:02.963 --> 01:11:04.997
'Cause without purpose,
we are nothing.

01:11:04.999 --> 01:11:08.102
Touching story.
Does it have a point?

01:11:08.869 --> 01:11:11.338
While raising Mateo,
my son,

01:11:12.605 --> 01:11:14.840
I began to understand
what I had taken from you.

01:11:14.842 --> 01:11:17.278
Wait. You grew a conscience?

01:11:18.879 --> 01:11:21.046
The equivalent of one, yes.

01:11:21.048 --> 01:11:22.749
It's an infiltrator.

01:11:23.117 --> 01:11:24.483
It's lying.

01:11:24.485 --> 01:11:27.986
When my mission was completed,
there were no further orders.

01:11:27.988 --> 01:11:30.621
So for 20 years,
I kept learning

01:11:30.623 --> 01:11:31.926
how to become more human.

01:11:33.461 --> 01:11:34.893
So what about the texts?

01:11:34.895 --> 01:11:37.329
When chronal
displacement occurs

01:11:37.331 --> 01:11:38.796
there's a shockwave
through time

01:11:38.798 --> 01:11:40.399
measurable before the event.

01:11:40.401 --> 01:11:43.202
That's how, not why.

01:11:43.204 --> 01:11:45.337
To give you purpose, Sarah.

01:11:45.339 --> 01:11:47.840
I thought it would bring
meaning to your son's death.

01:11:54.815 --> 01:11:57.617
You know what would
give meaning to his death?

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:00.354
No, Sarah!

01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:08.327
This will be very hard
to explain to Alicia.

01:12:08.329 --> 01:12:10.429
It's a Terminator!

01:12:10.431 --> 01:12:12.464
And we are fighting
a Terminator.

01:12:12.466 --> 01:12:14.335
One that we can't stop.

01:12:18.038 --> 01:12:20.638
Do you believe
in fate, Sarah?

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.808
Or do you believe that we all
can change the future

01:12:22.810 --> 01:12:25.045
every second by every
choice that we make?

01:12:26.646 --> 01:12:28.949
You chose
to change the future.

01:12:30.783 --> 01:12:33.254
You chose
to destroy Skynet.

01:12:34.388 --> 01:12:35.923
You set me free.

01:12:37.491 --> 01:12:39.790
And now,

01:12:39.792 --> 01:12:42.029
I'm going to help you
protect the girl

01:12:43.330 --> 01:12:44.899
because I choose to.

01:12:51.505 --> 01:12:53.472
That's Alicia.

01:12:53.474 --> 01:12:55.209
She needs my help
with the groceries.

01:13:02.082 --> 01:13:04.149
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

01:13:04.151 --> 01:13:05.651
We have company.

01:13:05.653 --> 01:13:07.121
Company? Who?

01:13:15.795 --> 01:13:17.398
Was there enough
hot water?

01:13:18.499 --> 01:13:20.067
- Yes, thank you.
- Thanks.

01:13:21.268 --> 01:13:22.369
Here you go.

01:13:24.704 --> 01:13:28.142
Carl, your friends
look hungry.

01:13:29.009 --> 01:13:30.708
Would you like
some sandwiches

01:13:30.710 --> 01:13:32.144
and chips or something?

01:13:32.146 --> 01:13:34.215
That's
a great idea, Alicia.

01:13:37.918 --> 01:13:40.785
Mateo, why don't you go
and help your mother?

01:13:40.787 --> 01:13:42.456
Sure, Dad.
I'm on it.

01:13:49.363 --> 01:13:50.831
So, you're Carl.

01:13:51.999 --> 01:13:53.799
That's what everyone
calls me, yes.

01:13:53.801 --> 01:13:56.337
I'm never gonna
fucking call you Carl.

01:14:00.574 --> 01:14:01.976
They don't know?

01:14:04.878 --> 01:14:06.378
- No.
- She hasn't noticed that

01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:08.614
you weigh 400 pounds?

01:14:08.616 --> 01:14:10.082
That you never sleep?

01:14:10.084 --> 01:14:12.150
Our relationship
is not physical.

01:14:12.152 --> 01:14:14.353
She appreciated that I
could change diapers.

01:14:14.355 --> 01:14:17.022
Efficiently and
without any complaints.

01:14:17.024 --> 01:14:20.294
I am reliable,
I'm a very good listener

01:14:20.928 --> 01:14:22.529
and I'm extremely funny.

01:14:25.566 --> 01:14:27.765
Okay.

01:14:27.767 --> 01:14:29.735
How do we stop
this thing?

01:14:29.737 --> 01:14:32.172
We choose our weapons
and our ground,

01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:34.706
we set up a kill box,

01:14:34.708 --> 01:14:36.541
and then we use Dani
to bring it to us.

01:14:36.543 --> 01:14:38.710
- What?
- And then we take it down.

01:14:38.712 --> 01:14:41.713
No. No way.
Dani is not bait.

01:14:41.715 --> 01:14:43.415
Sarah is right.

01:14:43.417 --> 01:14:47.119
Our one tactical advantage is that
the Terminator only sees its mission.

01:14:47.121 --> 01:14:49.755
Wherever Dani goes,
he will follow.

01:14:49.757 --> 01:14:51.823
Damn right it will.
And I will be there.

01:14:51.825 --> 01:14:55.761
Well, I'm not about to stake
her out like some goat for you.

01:14:55.763 --> 01:14:57.596
What's your plan?
More running?

01:14:57.598 --> 01:15:01.033
My plan is to hide her at the
bottom of a mineshaft if I have to.

01:15:01.035 --> 01:15:03.201
- At least until I...
- Just stop it!

01:15:03.203 --> 01:15:05.372
I'm not hiding at the
bottom of a mineshaft.

01:15:08.542 --> 01:15:11.009
I'm not gonna live in fear
the rest of my life.

01:15:11.011 --> 01:15:13.447
Even if your plan means
that might not be long.

01:15:15.582 --> 01:15:17.918
I want to stand and fight.

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:21.253
So, we choose
our weapons

01:15:21.255 --> 01:15:22.788
and our ground.

01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:24.423
We're gonna set up a...

01:15:24.425 --> 01:15:26.224
- Kill box.
- Kill box.

01:15:26.226 --> 01:15:28.829
And then, we're gonna
use me as bait.

01:15:29.697 --> 01:15:31.565
And then,
we kill that thing.

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:35.167
Okay?

01:15:35.169 --> 01:15:37.604
This plan has a high
probability of success.

01:15:44.111 --> 01:15:45.112
Okay.

01:15:47.614 --> 01:15:48.615
What weapons?

01:16:09.937 --> 01:16:12.070
You just keep these around?

01:16:12.072 --> 01:16:14.673
Even without
a rogue AI taking over,

01:16:14.675 --> 01:16:16.708
I calculate a 74% chance

01:16:16.710 --> 01:16:19.911
that human civilization
will collapse into barbarism.

01:16:19.913 --> 01:16:21.446
And in that eventuality,

01:16:21.448 --> 01:16:24.385
these weapons will be vital
to protect my family.

01:16:25.854 --> 01:16:27.054
Also...

01:16:28.489 --> 01:16:29.923
this is Texas.

01:16:41.502 --> 01:16:42.603
Go. Rapid fire.

01:16:47.274 --> 01:16:49.274
You're anticipating
the recoil.

01:16:49.276 --> 01:16:51.245
Put your weight forward,
arms up.

01:16:51.945 --> 01:16:53.011
And wider stance.

01:16:53.013 --> 01:16:54.146
Don't lock out
your elbows.

01:16:54.148 --> 01:16:55.614
Enough of this bullshit.

01:16:55.616 --> 01:16:57.084
Let's get serious.

01:17:05.259 --> 01:17:07.626
A Terminator has just
killed your whole family.

01:17:07.628 --> 01:17:08.996
What do you do?

01:17:21.375 --> 01:17:23.608
You know these guns
won't kill it.

01:17:23.610 --> 01:17:25.179
They'll only slow him down.

01:17:26.547 --> 01:17:29.681
According to your description
of his capabilities,

01:17:29.683 --> 01:17:31.082
our best option
is to secure

01:17:31.084 --> 01:17:32.953
a military-grade
energy weapon.

01:17:33.787 --> 01:17:34.988
An EMP?

01:17:36.089 --> 01:17:37.222
What is that?

01:17:37.224 --> 01:17:39.257
An electromagnetic pulse.

01:17:39.259 --> 01:17:40.792
If we had one
close range,

01:17:40.794 --> 01:17:42.296
it would fry a Rev-9.

01:17:43.096 --> 01:17:45.263
I might know a guy.

01:17:45.265 --> 01:17:47.734
Air Force intelligence officer
out of Bingham.

01:17:48.635 --> 01:17:50.368
It's 94 miles from here.

01:17:50.370 --> 01:17:52.005
We should leave
this afternoon.

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:54.841
Okay.

01:17:54.843 --> 01:17:57.275
You've been tracking me?

01:17:57.277 --> 01:18:00.345
If you want to keep your phone
in a bag of potato chips,

01:18:00.347 --> 01:18:02.749
then keep your phone
in a bag of potato chips.

01:18:27.341 --> 01:18:28.640
Take good care of Mama.

01:18:28.642 --> 01:18:29.743
I will.

01:18:30.344 --> 01:18:31.578
You're gonna be okay.

01:19:10.651 --> 01:19:12.119
What did you tell them?

01:19:13.153 --> 01:19:14.419
I told them
you coming here

01:19:14.421 --> 01:19:17.155
makes this place unsafe
for them.

01:19:17.157 --> 01:19:21.461
Also, the day I warned them
might come, has come.

01:19:22.830 --> 01:19:24.565
My past has
caught up with me.

01:19:26.901 --> 01:19:28.101
And...

01:19:30.304 --> 01:19:31.738
I won't be back.

01:19:37.845 --> 01:19:39.179
Do you love them?

01:19:42.282 --> 01:19:44.151
Not like a human can.

01:19:45.252 --> 01:19:47.588
For many years I thought
it was an advantage.

01:19:50.490 --> 01:19:51.692
It isn't.

01:19:53.962 --> 01:19:55.362
I'm sorry.

01:20:05.873 --> 01:20:07.472
I just want you to know

01:20:07.474 --> 01:20:10.277
that when Dani's safe
and this is all over,

01:20:11.612 --> 01:20:13.113
I am going to kill you.

01:20:14.082 --> 01:20:15.582
I understand.

01:21:28.156 --> 01:21:31.256
There's much more to it
than just picking the right color.

01:21:31.258 --> 01:21:34.994
It's the texture,
the weight of the material.

01:21:34.996 --> 01:21:37.362
- One wrong choice...
- Sarah, you okay?

01:21:37.364 --> 01:21:40.231
...it can destroy
the look of the entire room.

01:21:40.233 --> 01:21:41.801
- Fine.
- There was this one customer

01:21:41.803 --> 01:21:42.968
that came to me.

01:21:42.970 --> 01:21:44.870
He wanted to have
solid-color drapes

01:21:44.872 --> 01:21:46.237
in a little girl's room.

01:21:46.239 --> 01:21:47.875
I said, "Don't do it."

01:21:48.943 --> 01:21:50.742
You need butterflies,

01:21:50.744 --> 01:21:52.379
polka dots, balloons.

01:22:05.193 --> 01:22:06.727
Stay put.

01:22:12.066 --> 01:22:15.201
Always good
to see you, Major.

01:22:15.203 --> 01:22:17.604
It's never good
to see you, Connor.

01:22:18.538 --> 01:22:20.607
You got my birthday present?

01:22:29.783 --> 01:22:31.449
You know, Sarah,

01:22:31.451 --> 01:22:33.720
I don't commit treason
for just anybody.

01:22:35.890 --> 01:22:37.555
What's the range
of the EMP

01:22:37.557 --> 01:22:39.559
against a Class Four
hardened target?

01:22:41.162 --> 01:22:42.496
Bodyguard?

01:22:43.831 --> 01:22:44.932
I do drapes.

01:22:47.135 --> 01:22:50.102
He's part of
my operations team.

01:22:50.104 --> 01:22:52.974
And he should just
shut the fuck up.

01:22:54.608 --> 01:22:56.743
Major, what kind of helos
fly out of Bingham?

01:22:58.411 --> 01:23:00.781
Black Hawks
and Chinooks. Why?

01:23:02.016 --> 01:23:03.283
He's found us.

01:23:11.893 --> 01:23:12.894
Take cover!

01:23:15.196 --> 01:23:17.064
Major!

01:23:23.938 --> 01:23:25.338
We're in. Go.

01:23:55.435 --> 01:23:58.170
Head for the base.
About two miles down this road.

01:23:58.172 --> 01:23:59.606
It'll be on us again
in a minute.

01:24:04.377 --> 01:24:05.811
This is Major Dean,

01:24:05.813 --> 01:24:08.981
361st Intelligence, Surveillance,
and Reconnaissance Group.

01:24:08.983 --> 01:24:11.183
<i>Declaring THREATCON Delta.</i>

01:24:11.185 --> 01:24:14.686
<i>I'm currently two miles south of
Bingham Air Base in a white van.</i>

01:24:14.688 --> 01:24:16.487
<i>Headed for the west gate.</i>

01:24:16.489 --> 01:24:19.659
<i>Pursued by hostiles
in a stolen police helicopter.</i>

01:24:30.271 --> 01:24:31.703
Where are we going?

01:24:31.705 --> 01:24:33.638
Can't all those soldiers
back there help us?

01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:36.809
They'll be able to slow it
down, but they can't kill it.

01:24:36.811 --> 01:24:38.077
The C-5.

01:24:38.079 --> 01:24:39.345
Can you fly that?

01:24:39.347 --> 01:24:40.680
Of course.

01:24:41.983 --> 01:24:44.350
<i>You are
entering unauthorized airspace.</i>

01:24:44.352 --> 01:24:46.720
<i>Turn around now
or we will open fire.</i>

01:24:49.824 --> 01:24:50.825
Get ready.

01:24:57.764 --> 01:24:58.931
What the hell?

01:24:58.933 --> 01:25:00.565
Stand down!

01:25:00.567 --> 01:25:03.104
These people are district
contractors. Friendlies.

01:25:04.437 --> 01:25:06.038
I'll do what I can
to cover your backs

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:07.407
until you can get airborne.

01:25:18.485 --> 01:25:21.122
Hey, they're
not clear! Stop 'em!

01:25:35.036 --> 01:25:36.137
We have been reacquired.

01:25:40.808 --> 01:25:41.809
Take cover!

01:25:47.014 --> 01:25:48.481
Don't touch me.

01:26:22.450 --> 01:26:23.650
I'm out.

01:26:41.501 --> 01:26:42.702
Carl!

01:27:27.148 --> 01:27:28.615
Sorry about your shed.

01:27:32.319 --> 01:27:35.553
<i>Bridge 42,
this is Viper 16. Stay in tension.</i>

01:27:35.555 --> 01:27:37.122
Hopefully they won't
shoot us down.

01:27:37.124 --> 01:27:38.756
<i>Noble Eagle Ops,
this is Viper 16.</i>

01:27:38.758 --> 01:27:39.825
Where are we going?

01:27:39.827 --> 01:27:41.726
Figuring that out next.

01:27:41.728 --> 01:27:44.496
But those Humvees are rigged
for parachute landing,

01:27:44.498 --> 01:27:45.998
so we can punch out

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.002
and then find some remote
spot to use the EMP.

01:27:48.568 --> 01:27:49.937
We have a problem.

01:27:58.112 --> 01:28:03.048
So... if we fight him
without those, can we win?

01:28:03.050 --> 01:28:07.154
Based on the weapons we have,
I estimate our chances at 12%.

01:28:11.325 --> 01:28:12.725
That's not zero.

01:28:13.394 --> 01:28:14.560
It's not much better.

01:28:14.562 --> 01:28:17.229
Then we have to find
some more weapons

01:28:17.231 --> 01:28:18.564
and we stick to the plan.

01:28:18.566 --> 01:28:22.002
- We set the trap and then we can...
- No, Dani, you can't do that.

01:28:23.904 --> 01:28:24.972
Why?

01:28:25.906 --> 01:28:28.173
Because my son is supposed
to save us all?

01:28:28.175 --> 01:28:29.310
And until then, what?

01:28:30.277 --> 01:28:31.944
We just keep
watching people die?

01:28:31.946 --> 01:28:33.545
The future of the human race
depends on you making it...

01:28:33.547 --> 01:28:35.280
I don't give a shit
about the future.

01:28:35.282 --> 01:28:38.550
Or what I'm maybe
supposed to do someday.

01:28:38.552 --> 01:28:41.322
What matters are the
choices we make now.

01:28:43.090 --> 01:28:46.827
I've seen that look
too many times before.

01:28:49.163 --> 01:28:50.197
You knew me.

01:28:54.667 --> 01:28:55.970
In the future.

01:28:57.905 --> 01:28:58.906
Yeah.

01:29:01.475 --> 01:29:02.877
I know you.

01:29:04.044 --> 01:29:05.212
It was you...

01:29:07.214 --> 01:29:10.050
who found me in the ruins
after Judgment Day.

01:29:11.051 --> 01:29:12.219
<i>You saved me.</i>

01:29:43.150 --> 01:29:44.151
HKs.

01:29:45.886 --> 01:29:49.190
Shoot me, and we'll all
be dead in 10 seconds.

01:29:50.157 --> 01:29:52.860
This is what Legion
wants us to do.

01:29:54.528 --> 01:29:55.762
Kill each other.

01:30:01.235 --> 01:30:03.902
We should be fighting
the machines.

01:30:03.904 --> 01:30:06.737
What's the point?
We can't win.

01:30:06.739 --> 01:30:09.575
Legion didn't exist
until humans created it.

01:30:09.577 --> 01:30:11.111
We made that thing.

01:30:11.879 --> 01:30:13.214
We can destroy it.

01:30:13.981 --> 01:30:15.746
Are we supposed
to lie down and die

01:30:15.748 --> 01:30:17.885
because some machine
decided it?

01:30:19.220 --> 01:30:20.387
Is that our fate?

01:30:21.655 --> 01:30:23.057
Well, fuck fate.

01:30:44.645 --> 01:30:45.913
What's your name?

01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:47.381
Grace.

01:30:57.291 --> 01:30:58.292
Grace.

01:30:59.493 --> 01:31:00.861
I'm Daniella.

01:31:02.263 --> 01:31:03.264
Dani.

01:31:05.599 --> 01:31:06.834
<i>You saved me</i>

01:31:08.269 --> 01:31:09.503
<i>and you raised me,</i>

01:31:13.507 --> 01:31:15.142
<i>and you taught me to hope.</i>

01:31:18.045 --> 01:31:21.315
<i>Like you saved
and taught the others.</i>

01:31:23.751 --> 01:31:26.752
<i>You turned scavengers
into militias</i>

01:31:26.754 --> 01:31:29.154
<i>and militias into an army.</i>

01:31:29.156 --> 01:31:33.827
<i>We rose up out of the ashes
and we took our world back.</i>

01:31:36.630 --> 01:31:37.931
You taught us

01:31:39.733 --> 01:31:41.802
there is no fate

01:31:42.836 --> 01:31:45.139
but what we make
for ourselves.

01:31:50.711 --> 01:31:51.912
Dani,

01:31:53.647 --> 01:31:58.285
you are not the mother of
some man who saves the future.

01:32:01.455 --> 01:32:02.923
You are the future.

01:32:04.692 --> 01:32:06.527
That's why Legion
wants you dead.

01:32:10.531 --> 01:32:11.932
She's John.

01:32:18.672 --> 01:32:20.007
You're John.

01:32:21.108 --> 01:32:23.110
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you this before.

01:32:24.178 --> 01:32:27.014
But you told me that
the Dani I'd meet in the past

01:32:28.015 --> 01:32:29.350
couldn't handle it.

01:32:30.317 --> 01:32:32.186
But you're not that
Dani anymore.

01:32:34.121 --> 01:32:35.422
<i>Delta Echo 12.</i>

01:32:35.989 --> 01:32:37.391
<i>This is KC-320.</i>

01:32:38.025 --> 01:32:39.259
<i>Ready to refuel.</i>

01:32:39.727 --> 01:32:40.928
<i>Acknowledge.</i>

01:32:45.532 --> 01:32:48.602
<i>Copy that, KC-320,
but aren't you a bit early?</i>

01:32:53.207 --> 01:32:54.439
It's him.

01:32:54.441 --> 01:32:55.674
We gotta go. Now.

01:32:55.676 --> 01:32:56.877
Strap in to the Humvee.

01:33:45.459 --> 01:33:46.527
Grace!

01:33:56.905 --> 01:33:58.172
Dani!

01:34:05.847 --> 01:34:07.114
Dani!

01:34:10.250 --> 01:34:11.351
Fuck.

01:34:18.592 --> 01:34:20.160
Open the cargo bay.

01:35:05.639 --> 01:35:06.640
I'll get Sarah!

01:35:10.912 --> 01:35:13.580
- Sarah! The door?
- It's jammed!

01:36:10.137 --> 01:36:11.505
Get the straps.

01:36:53.714 --> 01:36:54.715
Shit!

01:36:58.185 --> 01:36:59.386
What's happening?

01:37:08.795 --> 01:37:10.997
Grace! Where is she?

01:37:10.999 --> 01:37:12.299
I don't see her.

01:37:13.166 --> 01:37:15.268
Oh, fuck.

01:37:26.780 --> 01:37:28.682
Got two more.
They're bringing 'em in.

01:37:29.884 --> 01:37:30.885
Guys!

01:37:36.090 --> 01:37:37.357
What the shit?

01:37:55.143 --> 01:37:57.242
Oh, my God! Grace.

01:37:57.244 --> 01:37:59.446
- I thought you were dead.
- We're dropping too fast.

01:38:29.209 --> 01:38:31.511
Three, two, one!

01:38:34.548 --> 01:38:36.349
- My God!
- Oh, shit!

01:38:46.828 --> 01:38:47.895
Dani, get out.

01:38:49.663 --> 01:38:51.933
- It's blocked!
- It's not gonna hold!

01:38:53.233 --> 01:38:54.434
Hold on!

01:38:59.473 --> 01:39:00.507
No!

01:39:06.948 --> 01:39:07.982
Sarah?

01:39:08.883 --> 01:39:10.918
- What is it?
- My shoulder.

01:39:11.785 --> 01:39:13.318
It's dislocated.

01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:14.889
So you're a doctor now?

01:39:17.825 --> 01:39:19.024
Fuck!

01:39:31.538 --> 01:39:33.573
He's coming.
We can't stay here.

01:39:38.311 --> 01:39:39.579
Oh, shit.

01:39:43.084 --> 01:39:44.317
What is she doing?

01:39:46.386 --> 01:39:48.655
No, no, Grace. Really?

01:39:49.756 --> 01:39:50.823
Strap in!

01:39:50.825 --> 01:39:53.895
Right. Otherwise
it could be dangerous.

01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:30.865
Try to find the lights.

01:40:42.409 --> 01:40:43.610
Get down!

01:40:48.816 --> 01:40:51.917
There's a parachute
back there. Grab it.

01:40:51.919 --> 01:40:54.088
We can tangle him up.

01:40:57.457 --> 01:40:58.723
Listen to me.

01:40:58.725 --> 01:41:01.827
It comes,
you pull this cord.

01:41:01.829 --> 01:41:02.828
This cord.

01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:05.632
And then you swim past it
up to the surface.

01:41:07.201 --> 01:41:08.401
Okay.

01:41:09.070 --> 01:41:10.135
Okay.

01:42:05.092 --> 01:42:06.093
Grace.

01:42:15.303 --> 01:42:16.501
Where is it?

01:42:16.503 --> 01:42:18.037
I don't know.
I lost him.

01:42:18.039 --> 01:42:19.437
We can't stay here.

01:42:19.439 --> 01:42:21.240
We gotta go.

01:42:21.242 --> 01:42:22.740
All right.

01:42:29.317 --> 01:42:31.116
Can you
make it up there?

01:42:31.118 --> 01:42:32.186
I don't know.

01:42:44.999 --> 01:42:46.999
It's locked.

01:42:47.001 --> 01:42:48.135
Let me try.

01:42:57.979 --> 01:42:58.980
Grace.

01:43:00.247 --> 01:43:01.548
Wait.

01:43:02.716 --> 01:43:05.052
There's maybe another door.

01:43:08.089 --> 01:43:09.190
Shit.

01:43:10.958 --> 01:43:12.424
Grace!

01:43:14.395 --> 01:43:16.728
Dani, you have to run.

01:43:16.730 --> 01:43:19.166
- You have to run. We can't protect you.
- What?

01:43:21.701 --> 01:43:25.705
I'm the only one of us
who can still throw a punch.

01:43:27.408 --> 01:43:28.843
There's another weapon.

01:43:30.177 --> 01:43:31.243
What?

01:43:31.245 --> 01:43:32.545
My power source.

01:43:34.681 --> 01:43:37.818
How do we get it out of you
without killing you?

01:43:39.619 --> 01:43:41.621
- You can't.
- No!

01:44:03.044 --> 01:44:04.045
What?

01:44:26.067 --> 01:44:27.866
You look terrible.

01:44:27.868 --> 01:44:30.104
At least I still
have all my face.

01:44:31.939 --> 01:44:34.108
You left this
on the plane.

01:44:36.911 --> 01:44:38.578
I can't get
through that door.

01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:14.915
Come on! Hurry!

01:45:17.518 --> 01:45:18.817
We have to move.

01:45:18.819 --> 01:45:20.452
He's not far behind.

01:45:20.454 --> 01:45:21.721
No.

01:45:22.423 --> 01:45:24.158
We make our stand here.

01:45:26.594 --> 01:45:28.795
This is our kill box.

01:45:43.344 --> 01:45:44.812
Dani.

01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:51.185
I'm not running!

01:46:02.596 --> 01:46:03.998
Give me the girl.

01:46:05.633 --> 01:46:06.934
No.

01:46:10.804 --> 01:46:12.705
You really should.

01:46:13.673 --> 01:46:16.277
You and I were built
for the same purpose.

01:46:16.944 --> 01:46:18.709
And Legion is the only future.

01:46:18.711 --> 01:46:20.848
I came from a future
like that.

01:46:21.315 --> 01:46:22.682
It failed.

01:46:25.286 --> 01:46:27.855
I know she's
a stranger to you.

01:46:29.590 --> 01:46:31.156
Why not just
let me have her?

01:46:31.158 --> 01:46:34.929
Because we're not machines,
you metal motherfucker.

01:47:09.697 --> 01:47:10.996
Grace!

01:47:10.998 --> 01:47:12.264
Hey! Hey!

01:47:12.266 --> 01:47:13.867
I'm over here!

01:47:25.112 --> 01:47:26.113
Move.

01:47:30.985 --> 01:47:32.086
Sarah!

01:49:22.796 --> 01:49:23.997
Move!

01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:08.607
Where's Grace?

01:50:08.609 --> 01:50:10.144
I don't know.

01:50:12.746 --> 01:50:14.081
Oh, there she is.

01:50:14.883 --> 01:50:16.816
Grace! Grace!

01:50:16.818 --> 01:50:18.352
Are you okay?

01:50:22.656 --> 01:50:23.924
Grace.

01:50:49.483 --> 01:50:50.584
Sarah!

01:50:58.759 --> 01:51:00.091
It's not dead.

01:51:00.093 --> 01:51:02.629
Wait. We gotta take you
out of here.

01:51:03.932 --> 01:51:06.467
Okay? Grace, let's go.

01:51:07.201 --> 01:51:09.034
My power source.

01:51:09.036 --> 01:51:11.570
Get it close,
and it'll fry his neural net.

01:51:11.572 --> 01:51:13.040
Grace...

01:51:14.708 --> 01:51:15.875
I can't.

01:51:15.877 --> 01:51:18.045
Yes, you can.

01:51:35.229 --> 01:51:36.495
Dani.

01:51:36.497 --> 01:51:39.066
This is what
you sent me here to do.

01:51:49.343 --> 01:51:50.775
No.

01:51:50.777 --> 01:51:53.013
We both knew
I wasn't coming back.

01:51:57.986 --> 01:52:00.118
- I can't.
- Dani, please.

01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:01.688
You saved me.

01:52:02.924 --> 01:52:04.224
Let me save you.

01:52:08.629 --> 01:52:09.862
- Please.
- No.

01:52:09.864 --> 01:52:11.064
You do it.

01:52:12.132 --> 01:52:13.398
Do it, Dani.

01:52:23.043 --> 01:52:24.545
I'm sorry, Grace.

01:52:29.650 --> 01:52:31.184
I'm not.

01:52:52.472 --> 01:52:54.441
I'm gonna kill you, fucker.

01:53:21.903 --> 01:53:23.170
Hey!

01:53:23.503 --> 01:53:24.703
Get up!

01:53:24.705 --> 01:53:25.807
Help her!

01:53:30.510 --> 01:53:32.044
God damn it...

01:53:32.046 --> 01:53:33.111
Carl!

01:53:33.113 --> 01:53:34.314
Wake up!

01:55:12.646 --> 01:55:13.815
For John.

01:56:22.817 --> 01:56:24.351
We got him, Grace.

01:56:29.090 --> 01:56:30.557
You saved me.

01:56:47.374 --> 01:56:48.675
<i>Grace!</i>

01:56:50.211 --> 01:56:51.676
Grace, come on, honey.

01:56:51.678 --> 01:56:52.847
It's time to go.

01:57:03.690 --> 01:57:07.061
- Come on, you two.
- Grab your stuff, you guys.

01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:28.816
I won't let her die
for me again.

01:57:31.018 --> 01:57:33.520
Then you need to be ready.
