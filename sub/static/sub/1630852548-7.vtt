is Katherine Rippensburg.

40:47.078 --> 40:49.280
I'm a psychoanalyst.

40:49.347 --> 40:53.251
Welcome to Vienna, the hometown
of modern psychotherapy.

40:53.318 --> 40:54.652
Sigmund Freud was born here.

40:54.719 --> 40:57.088
He's the founder
of psychoanalysis.

40:57.155 --> 41:01.993
It's all about unveiling
the deepest layers of fears,

41:02.060 --> 41:05.196
emotions, anxieties,

41:05.263 --> 41:08.433
and it's all hidden
in your subconscious mind.

41:08.499 --> 41:12.103
Each of you will have
a couple therapy session

41:12.170 --> 41:14.739

41:14.806 --> 41:17.075
I know some of you
are going to introduce Clayton

41:17.141 --> 41:18.242
to your parents next week

41:18.309 --> 41:20.545
so I think this
is the perfect moment

41:20.611 --> 41:23.982
to all know what you
truly feel about him.

41:24.048 --> 41:27.452
So, ladies, please go upstairs
and wait for me,

41:27.518 --> 41:29.420

41:29.487 --> 41:30.922
- Okay.

<i>- I've never been</i>
<i>to couples therapy.</i>

41:32.557 --> 41:34.325

41:34.392 --> 41:38.696
I'm assuming that you have to,
you know, put it all out there.

41:38.763 --> 41:40.999
<i>She did make it seem</i>
<i>that it's gonna be tough,</i>

41:41.065 --> 41:44.902

I can make it through.

41:44.969 --> 41:47.271
- That lady
seemed very serious.

41:47.338 --> 41:50.441

41:50.508 --> 41:51.476
and I don't want to say

41:51.542 --> 41:53.077
something
that's gonna scare him.

41:53.144 --> 41:57.081
- Yeah, I haven't really
gone to therapy for a reason,

41:57.148 --> 41:59.884
because I don't like
talking about things

41:59.951 --> 42:02.387
that make me upset and crying.

42:02.453 --> 42:03.588
<i>I'm terrified.</i>

42:03.654 --> 42:06.290
<i>It takes a lot</i>
<i>for me to open up.</i>

42:06.357 --> 42:09.827

unless I'm in a setting

42:09.894 --> 42:11.629

42:11.696 --> 42:13.731
- They seem to be
very intimidated right now.

42:13.798 --> 42:15.433
- I know, I think that's
what I could tell is, like,

42:15.500 --> 42:16.868
they're kind of nervous
as far as like

42:16.934 --> 42:18.936
how deep of a dive this'll be.

42:19.003 --> 42:22.106
I mean, the fear is, like,
not choosing the right person.

42:22.173 --> 42:24.609
It's also just like, if there's
something that's a deal breaker

42:24.675 --> 42:26.411
or something that
I just can't look past,

42:26.477 --> 42:29.881
I mean, that's--that
part of it, I'm not sure.

42:29.947 --> 42:32.216
- You just don't even know
where he's at,

42:32.283 --> 42:33.851
so it'll be interesting to see

42:33.918 --> 42:35.820
kind of what comes up,
you know.

42:35.887 --> 42:37.021
- Yeah.

42:37.088 --> 42:39.424
<i>- I'm a little nervous,</i>
<i>but I understand</i>

42:39.490 --> 42:41.359

<i>something really special.</i>

kind of ever been with him.

42:52.370 --> 42:53.771
Hi.

42:53.838 --> 42:55.139
- You too.

42:55.206 --> 42:57.108
- So how do you feel?

42:57.175 --> 43:00.111
- That is a loaded question.

43:00.178 --> 43:02.814
A little anxious,
but also I've kind of gotten

43:02.880 --> 43:05.149
to a place where I want
to be able to share,

43:05.216 --> 43:07.752
like, everything about me
with my partner.

43:07.819 --> 43:11.089
- Yeah, I think that for me,
like, what I've seen out of you

43:11.155 --> 43:13.758
is you've really focused
in the last couple of weeks,

43:13.825 --> 43:17.361
like, becoming more
vulnerable emotionally.

43:17.428 --> 43:20.031
And you're very comfortable
talking about, like,

43:20.098 --> 43:22.467
all the emotional aspects
of a relationship.

43:22.533 --> 43:25.069
- Yeah,
I'm very emotional, like,

43:25.136 --> 43:26.804
in the good things
and the bad things.

43:26.871 --> 43:29.740
And it's something, like,
I feel very grateful to have,

43:29.807 --> 43:32.343
you know, because I
just feel, like, so deep.

43:32.410 --> 43:35.012
Like, there's been times
in my life

43:35.079 --> 43:36.581
where, like,
I haven't been able to, like,

43:36.647 --> 43:39.083
feel, like, this much,
you know?

43:39.150 --> 43:42.220
- Tell me a bit about it.

43:42.286 --> 43:45.256
- Growing up,
I had a misunderstanding

43:45.323 --> 43:46.991
of what love is and, like,

43:47.058 --> 43:51.062
the--the conditionality
of it, if that's a word.

43:51.129 --> 43:54.098
With my mom in particular,
I felt like it could be

43:54.165 --> 43:57.168
taken away at, like,
any moment for any reason.

43:57.235 --> 43:58.836
- How about your father?

43:58.903 --> 44:01.539
- We have
a really good relationship.

44:01.606 --> 44:03.441
My parents aren't together.
They divorced

44:03.508 --> 44:06.344
when I was younger,
but he's always kind of

44:06.410 --> 44:10.882
appreciated me for who I was
and was always very supportive.

44:10.948 --> 44:13.851
You know, he would just,
like, want someone, like,

44:13.918 --> 44:16.454
to make me happy
and just, like, allow me

44:16.521 --> 44:18.890
to like be myself,
like, through and through.

44:18.956 --> 44:21.726
- So what you need
is a very stable relationship.

44:21.792 --> 44:23.094
- Yeah.

44:23.161 --> 44:25.830
- And a very secure feeling
of love.

44:25.897 --> 44:28.733
Do you think you can give it?
- Absolutely.

44:28.799 --> 44:31.002
For me, like, I've talked
before about, like,

44:31.068 --> 44:32.203
being that rock, like, that--

44:32.270 --> 44:35.339
that sense of safety
that I can provide.

44:35.406 --> 44:37.208
To be able to give
that love unconditionally

44:37.275 --> 44:40.211
and to not let
my significant other

44:40.278 --> 44:41.646
ever have a moment
where they feel like

44:41.712 --> 44:46.083
I'm not thankful
for what we have.

44:46.150 --> 44:49.387
Gabby continues to show me
that she has this trust in me

44:49.453 --> 44:52.390
to be able to talk about her
relationship with her parents.

44:52.456 --> 44:54.492

44:58.262 --> 45:00.498

what I'm looking for.

45:09.006 --> 45:12.276

in the past,

45:17.348 --> 45:18.916
and especially this early.

45:18.983 --> 45:20.484

45:20.551 --> 45:23.254

the beginning of all this.

45:23.321 --> 45:26.023
Yeah, I feel very good
about where we're currently at.

45:26.090 --> 45:27.458
- Yeah.

45:27.525 --> 45:29.260
<i>- You know, Teddi is</i>
<i>so very honest with me</i>

45:29.327 --> 45:30.595
<i>and the more</i>
<i>that she tells me,</i>

45:30.661 --> 45:32.296
<i>the more that I'm drawn</i>
<i>closer to her</i>

45:32.363 --> 45:35.333

45:35.399 --> 45:36.901

45:36.968 --> 45:38.102

are the ones

45:38.169 --> 45:40.538
where you learn the most
and grow the most.

45:41.572 --> 45:44.809
- So hello.
Are you nervous?

45:44.875 --> 45:47.111
- I'm nervous.
Very nervous, yes.

45:47.178 --> 45:50.348
- Why so?

45:50.414 --> 45:53.251
- I am--I don't like talking
about my feelings,

45:53.317 --> 45:55.386
and I don't like being
emotional in front of people,

45:55.453 --> 45:56.787
especially crying.

45:56.854 --> 46:00.291
So I try to kind of put it off
as much as I can.

46:00.358 --> 46:02.526

my intuition was telling me

56:29.820 --> 56:31.755
that there wasn't much
validity to that statement.

56:31.822 --> 56:34.791

you started reassuring me,

56:34.858 --> 56:37.361
I was like, okay, like, I don't
have anything to worry about.

56:37.427 --> 56:39.763

56:39.830 --> 56:42.499

like, trust was established on

56:42.566 --> 56:44.034

1:24:53.488 --> 1:24:55.324
- Okay, that's nice.

1:24:55.390 --> 1:24:57.092
- Yeah, that looks good, yep.

1:24:58.727 --> 1:25:00.329

1:25:00.395 --> 1:25:03.198
Ah, ah, ah...
- I love the dance moves too.

1:25:05.801 --> 1:25:08.203

1:25:08.270 --> 1:25:09.671
- Just like this, right?
