WEBVTT

00:01.406 --> 00:03.533
<i>(Ford) Previously on Stargate Atlantis...</i>

00:03.700 --> 00:06.870
It can't be a storm.
It stretches across the whole horizon.

00:07.037 --> 00:10.790
- It covers 20% of the planet.
- If you want them to live, gate them off.

00:10.957 --> 00:14.127
In the next hour there'll be
under ten people on Atlantis.

00:14.294 --> 00:16.546
We cannot pass up this opportunity.

00:17.255 --> 00:21.426
What is the one thing keeping us
from having a shield? Electricity.

00:21.593 --> 00:25.931
Atlantis is designed to withstand lightning
strikes. There are rods everywhere.

00:26.097 --> 00:29.517
If we disabled the grounding stations,
the energy could be used

00:29.684 --> 00:31.770
to charge up the shield generators.

00:31.937 --> 00:34.064
We're waiting in the jumper.

00:39.903 --> 00:42.822
A small Genii strike force has gated in.

00:42.989 --> 00:46.284
- Why are you doing this?
- You possess supplies we need.

00:46.451 --> 00:49.412
The C4 explosive.
All of your medical supplies.

00:49.579 --> 00:53.875
As of right now,
we are in control of Atlantis.

00:54.042 --> 00:56.127
Say goodbye to Dr Weir.

00:56.795 --> 00:58.922
<i>(Ford) And now the conclusion.</i>

01:01.216 --> 01:02.634
Kolya!

01:04.177 --> 01:06.054
Kolya, don't do this!

01:07.264 --> 01:09.391
How does this help get what you want?

01:09.557 --> 01:12.352
Sheppard put you in this position, not me.

01:12.519 --> 01:15.313
- You can't do this. You need her.
- She's right.

01:15.480 --> 01:19.651
There are codes required that only
she knows. You can't do it without her.

01:23.113 --> 01:26.449
You can't do this without me, either.
We're a package deal.

01:26.616 --> 01:30.203
You take us out of the equation
and you don't have an end-game.

01:32.163 --> 01:34.207
That's a chess term.

01:34.374 --> 01:38.044
My point is, we're the only ones
who can fix the grounding station,

01:38.211 --> 01:40.380
the only ones
who can solve any problem!

01:40.547 --> 01:44.259
You kill either one of us
and you don't get what you want!

01:44.426 --> 01:46.511
- It's important...
- Rodney...

01:46.678 --> 01:49.055
Rodney, he gets it.

01:55.353 --> 01:59.232
- I appreciate...
- You're an asset we need for this mission.

02:04.779 --> 02:07.949
- You stood in front of a gun for me.
- Don't thank me yet.

02:08.116 --> 02:11.369
2¹/² hours till the storm hits,
and unless our luck changes,

02:11.536 --> 02:14.039
this city is gonna be obliterated.

02:30.180 --> 02:35.560
Major Sheppard, how's this for credibility?
Weir is dead.

02:37.354 --> 02:41.149
<i>- I'm going to kill you.
- Maybe.</i>

02:41.816 --> 02:44.194
Stay out of my way or McKay will join her.

04:22.959 --> 04:25.045
This is amazing.

04:30.884 --> 04:32.969
There you are.

04:34.971 --> 04:39.643
We're here. Take two men.
Head there, four levels down.

04:40.977 --> 04:43.688
- That's Sheppard.
- Yes, sir.

04:44.856 --> 04:47.317
Let's go. You're with me.

04:47.484 --> 04:49.527
He's heading out of the hallways.

05:13.176 --> 05:15.262
- Holy...!
- Right, that's it!

05:16.596 --> 05:21.226
- What are you doing, man?
- Adding weight to the puddle jumper.

05:21.393 --> 05:24.437
- Don't screw with the controls.
- Can't be too careful.

05:24.604 --> 05:29.276
You can be way too careful. There's
no chance we're gonna blow away.

05:29.442 --> 05:31.861
- Let it go.
- That should be enough.

05:32.028 --> 05:34.614
How much longer until the storm passes?

05:34.781 --> 05:38.910
I guess we're barely halfway through,
but there's no way to tell.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.711
I know. I hope they're OK, too.

06:20.744 --> 06:22.829
<i>(rapid bleeping)</i>

06:37.636 --> 06:39.721
What's this, then?

06:40.931 --> 06:43.850
- We're through it?
- We can't be.

06:44.684 --> 06:46.937
<i>(Beckett) That's not possible.</i>

06:54.653 --> 06:56.738
<i>(slow bleeping)</i>

07:06.498 --> 07:08.583
<i>(rapid bleeping)</i>

07:14.673 --> 07:16.883
He's moving.

07:24.808 --> 07:27.519
<i>(soldier) Are you sure
we're on the right level?</i>

07:40.198 --> 07:43.785
<i>- Where did he go?
- Sh! He can probably hear you.</i>

08:04.389 --> 08:06.474
Will you look at this?!

08:07.559 --> 08:12.188
How bad is this?!
That is just never gonna be useful again!

08:23.742 --> 08:26.912
I should be able to bypass
the switching station entirely.

08:27.078 --> 08:30.957
- Good. How long?
- It's not half as bad as it looks.

08:31.124 --> 08:34.085
- I'd say 15, 20 minutes, tops.
- Good.

08:35.294 --> 08:38.256
- Dr Weir, I need you to...
- Right, of course.

08:39.506 --> 08:42.010
Keep that there.

09:23.385 --> 09:26.680
- We're in the eye.
- Right. Has to be.

09:27.472 --> 09:30.308
- The eye?
- Dead centre of the storm.

09:30.475 --> 09:33.478
The storm swirls around
a 20 to 40 kilometre-wide area.

09:33.645 --> 09:35.438
Then this calm will not last?

09:35.605 --> 09:39.276
No. In fact, in about ten minutes,
it's gonna get very ugly again.

09:39.442 --> 09:43.905
- We have to help the major.
- We can take off, but landing's hard.

09:44.072 --> 09:46.324
- What if it's reached Atlantis?
- Has it?

09:46.491 --> 09:50.203
- It will any time now.
- Stop wasting time. Let's go.

09:50.370 --> 09:53.456
We still have to fly through the storm.
It's insanity.

09:53.623 --> 09:56.084
This is a spaceship.
We can fly up and over.

09:56.251 --> 10:00.297
Straight up and down? I'm a bloody
medical doctor, not a magician!

10:00.463 --> 10:03.717
- You can do it.
- If we can help, we must.

10:07.470 --> 10:08.847
Oh, crap.

10:10.348 --> 10:12.767
20 feet away.

10:23.069 --> 10:27.282
- Five feet.
- There's so much smoke. Which way?

10:30.285 --> 10:34.539
- You're right on top of him.
- Yeah? I think I would see him if I was.

10:34.706 --> 10:36.791
Stand by.

10:45.759 --> 10:47.427
<i>(gunfire over radio)</i>

10:47.594 --> 10:49.679
Do you see him?

10:51.222 --> 10:53.308
Did you get him?

10:54.517 --> 10:56.603
Report.

11:06.238 --> 11:09.032
<i>- (Sora) Commander.
- Yes, Sora.</i>

11:09.199 --> 11:13.119
Laden has been leading three of our men
on a reconnaissance mission.

11:13.286 --> 11:16.289
Major Sheppard has killed
three more of our strike team.

11:16.456 --> 11:19.793
Tell everyone to move back
to the control room.

11:22.963 --> 11:26.299
Why did you tell him you could
have this fixed in 20 minutes?

11:26.466 --> 11:30.220
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe so he wouldn't kill us!

11:30.387 --> 11:35.183
I understand that, but once the shield
is operational, we won't be very useful.

11:35.350 --> 11:38.019
Why did you let me tell him
I could fix it in 20?

11:38.186 --> 11:41.356
- You have to stall him.
- I told him how long it'll take.

11:41.523 --> 11:43.984
Find another problem with it.

11:44.150 --> 11:48.363
Tell them that the power loop interface
isn't jiving with your walkabout.

11:48.530 --> 11:50.991
- Isn't jiving?
- Rodney, you get my point.

11:51.825 --> 11:54.828
By the sounds of it,
if we can buy Sheppard enough time,

11:54.995 --> 11:58.415
he can take care
of the rest of them on his own.

11:59.749 --> 12:02.877
Radio Chief Cowen.
Tell him to send reinforcements.

12:03.044 --> 12:05.672
A full company.

12:05.839 --> 12:10.760
If you're hoping Major Sheppard can
diminish our numbers, you are mistaken.

12:22.355 --> 12:25.066
OK. What would McKay do?

12:35.076 --> 12:39.247
- You're coming in a little steep, Doc.
- Thank you. I'm very aware of that.

12:39.414 --> 12:41.666
I told you not to play with the controls.

12:41.833 --> 12:45.712
I'm sure I got 'em back right.
Why don't you try to contact the major?

12:45.879 --> 12:48.381
First you gotta get us in there.

13:08.318 --> 13:10.195
What are you up to?

13:17.118 --> 13:18.787
What's he done now?

13:22.749 --> 13:25.252
I should have seen this coming.

13:30.173 --> 13:33.969
Commander. Major Sheppard
has cut power to the control room.

13:34.135 --> 13:36.554
How?

13:37.847 --> 13:40.767
Atlantis is being powered
by five small generators,

13:40.934 --> 13:43.270
each responsible for a separate area.

13:43.436 --> 13:48.608
Major Sheppard has disabled the
generator that powers Stargate operations.

13:48.775 --> 13:51.903
We still have most primary operations.

13:54.948 --> 13:57.450
We have definitely lost
all secondary systems.

13:59.744 --> 14:02.455
Can you still track Sheppard?

14:03.248 --> 14:05.333
No.

14:06.126 --> 14:10.297
<i>- Then we have no idea where he is now?
- (Sora) No, sir.</i>

14:13.508 --> 14:17.095
<i>- (Kolya) Is the control room secure?
- (Sora) Yes, Commander.</i>

14:17.262 --> 14:20.098
<i>(Sora) I suggest we send men
to guard the generators.</i>

14:20.265 --> 14:23.602
<i>(Kolya) No! He's trying to divide us
into manageable numbers.</i>

14:23.768 --> 14:27.606
Just hold Stargate operations
until the reinforcements arrive.

14:27.772 --> 14:29.858
<i>(Sora) Understood.</i>

14:40.035 --> 14:42.871
If he asks what's taking so long,
you do the talking.

14:43.038 --> 14:46.166
- You'll be fine.
- No, I won't. I'm a terrible bluffer.

14:46.333 --> 14:51.254
I've lost small fortunes at poker.
My eye twitches, I laugh. It's not pretty.

14:51.421 --> 14:54.424
What's our progress?

14:54.591 --> 14:57.093
We've hit a small snag.

14:57.260 --> 15:01.222
We're running a diagnosis
to make sure we can interface our codes.

15:03.975 --> 15:07.062
It's a small snag.
It's like half an hour at the most.

15:07.479 --> 15:09.564
<i>(clang)</i>

15:10.273 --> 15:12.859
Sheppard has just disabled
another generator.

15:13.026 --> 15:17.822
Yes, Laden, I'm aware of that. He's cut
the power to grounding station three.

15:17.989 --> 15:20.075
Can it still be repaired?

15:23.536 --> 15:25.622
Without power, no.

15:27.624 --> 15:29.709
Can the plan be completed without it?

15:29.876 --> 15:32.796
The other three grounding stations
have been disabled.

15:32.963 --> 15:35.215
No, no, it's just not good enough.

15:35.382 --> 15:37.759
Look, by uncoupling
the grounding stations,

15:37.926 --> 15:42.180
when lightning strikes the city,
the electricity'll have nowhere to go.

15:42.347 --> 15:44.683
If we can channel the electricity properly

15:44.849 --> 15:47.310
to the conduits
that mine the city corridors,

15:47.477 --> 15:50.438
we should be able
to power the shield temporarily.

15:50.605 --> 15:53.149
If any grounding stations are left active,

15:53.316 --> 15:57.696
a sizeable amount of electricity
will find its way to ground, and no shield.

16:02.409 --> 16:04.703
The storm has not slowed its pace.

16:04.869 --> 16:08.331
We have little time.
We should re-evaluate our goals, perhaps.

16:08.498 --> 16:11.585
We have more than enough time
to complete our objectives.

16:11.751 --> 16:15.547
Then I must strongly advise that
we send men to repair the generators

16:15.714 --> 16:17.591
and to guard the active ones.

16:17.757 --> 16:21.136
Agreed. Teams of two,
but you watch over the control room.

16:21.303 --> 16:26.600
As soon as the reinforcements arrive,
have them take Sheppard with force.

16:26.766 --> 16:29.394
Understood.

16:30.979 --> 16:35.817
Perhaps we could be under shelter.
I'm liable to catch a cold like that.

16:38.653 --> 16:40.822
I take it that's a no?

16:55.795 --> 16:58.715
Remain here and be still.
I will return for you.

17:00.050 --> 17:01.927
- Where are we going?
- Armoury.

17:02.093 --> 17:03.470
Are you sure...

17:03.637 --> 17:07.390
You know you're always saying
you don't have to take orders?

17:07.557 --> 17:11.353
- Now you do.
- So long as it's temporary.

17:21.529 --> 17:24.991
- Shall we contact the major?
- The Genii may be monitoring us.

17:25.157 --> 17:27.827
We do not want to alert them
of our presence.

17:27.993 --> 17:30.205
Life-signs detector.

17:30.372 --> 17:34.584
These dots don't tell us who's who.
How do we know which one's the major?

17:34.751 --> 17:37.587
He'll be the dot
getting rid of the other dots.

18:01.653 --> 18:04.990
- How many should we expect?
- A full company. 60 or more.

18:06.491 --> 18:09.619
I don't know how we were expected
to do it with any less.

18:09.786 --> 18:13.456
It was supposed to be a raid
to retrieve what was rightfully ours.

18:15.458 --> 18:17.586
With me. Come on.

18:24.801 --> 18:27.554
Reinforcements are arriving now,
Commander.

18:27.721 --> 18:31.141
Have them secure Stargate operations
and report back to me.

18:31.308 --> 18:33.393
Yes, Commander.

18:37.981 --> 18:41.401
<i>- Secure the area. Anyone...
- (whirring)</i>

18:42.944 --> 18:44.905
Shut it off, Laden!

18:45.071 --> 18:47.824
<i>- Stop him!
- (man) Up there!</i>

18:52.203 --> 18:56.041
This is Sora. Stop sending reinforcements.
The shield has been raised.

18:58.126 --> 19:01.087
<i>- Sheppard has raised the gate shield.
- Shut it down.</i>

19:02.923 --> 19:06.134
<i>- Turn it off.
- I don't know how. Laden is unconscious.</i>

19:06.301 --> 19:08.553
- Tell her.
- I don't know what he's done.

19:08.720 --> 19:11.306
- Tell her!
- He must have added a command code.

19:11.473 --> 19:13.183
- What is it?
- I don't know!

19:13.350 --> 19:17.854
- Only Sheppard would know it.
- Trust me, I would help you if I could.

19:18.730 --> 19:21.316
You have command codes.

19:25.946 --> 19:28.406
It's no use.

19:28.573 --> 19:30.992
It's over.

19:34.829 --> 19:37.666
The gate has shut down.
There are no more men coming.

19:39.334 --> 19:42.045
How many men made it?

19:42.212 --> 19:45.966
Five. Five of sixty.

19:55.392 --> 19:58.019
You still need me, if you want this city.

20:02.190 --> 20:04.818
You still need both of us.

20:35.098 --> 20:38.476
He's entered some sort of security code
to lock down the gate.

20:38.643 --> 20:41.187
Give me some time.
Should be able to crack it.

20:41.354 --> 20:43.398
Do it.

20:43.565 --> 20:47.193
Commander, Laden thinks
he can have the gate fixed.

20:48.445 --> 20:50.739
Did Athor's son make it through the gate?

20:50.906 --> 20:52.782
I'm sorry?

20:52.949 --> 20:55.994
His name is Idos. Did he make it?

20:57.203 --> 20:59.289
No, sir.

21:04.628 --> 21:06.755
Over 60 men killed!

21:06.922 --> 21:10.926
Defending his home and his people,
Commander, as we would.

21:12.594 --> 21:14.679
When can more reinforcements be sent?

21:14.846 --> 21:17.682
- It will take time, perhaps an hour.
- Unacceptable.

21:17.849 --> 21:20.101
Yes, Commander, it is unacceptable.

21:20.268 --> 21:23.021
By then, we will be
in the full force of the storm.

21:23.188 --> 21:25.690
Probably sooner.

21:41.414 --> 21:43.500
<i>(rapid bleeping)</i>

21:51.925 --> 21:55.053
<i>(Kolya) Major Sheppard,
I have a proposition for you.</i>

21:57.973 --> 22:00.475
- Do you recognise that voice?
- No.

22:01.309 --> 22:04.729
Kolya, I'm having a hard time keeping up.
What's the score?

22:04.896 --> 22:09.359
My men have informed me that not only
have you disabled crucial generators,

22:09.526 --> 22:14.155
but you've stolen key components which
make it impossible for them to be restored.

22:14.322 --> 22:16.783
Yeah, I did that.

22:16.950 --> 22:19.578
There are two flaws in your plan.

22:19.744 --> 22:22.706
I'm always open to constructive criticism.

22:22.872 --> 22:25.208
One: The assumption I would believe

22:25.375 --> 22:29.212
you'd rather destroy the city,
than let it fall to us, is childish.

22:29.379 --> 22:32.465
- Doesn't sound like me.
- Second...

22:32.632 --> 22:35.760
If and when I determine
Atlantis unsalvageable,

22:35.927 --> 22:38.930
<i>Drs Weir and McKay become obsolete.</i>

22:40.390 --> 22:41.892
Weir's alive?

22:42.058 --> 22:45.979
Dr McKay was able to make a strong case
for keeping her alive.

22:46.146 --> 22:48.231
<i>Let me talk to her.</i>

22:54.321 --> 22:56.781
Sheppard, we're both here.

22:57.908 --> 23:02.454
- It's good to hear your voice.
- That's good to hear.

23:02.621 --> 23:06.750
We have less than one hour
before the storm hits full force.

23:06.917 --> 23:14.090
If the power is not returned to grounding
station three in ten minutes, Dr Weir dies.

23:16.176 --> 23:20.221
- Again, you mean?
- Her death will buy you ten minutes,

23:20.388 --> 23:24.309
after which, should the power still be out,
Dr McKay dies.

23:24.476 --> 23:28.146
We will then leave with what we can
and the city will be destroyed.

23:28.313 --> 23:30.190
That's not enough time.

23:30.357 --> 23:34.819
If you don't mind destroying Atlantis,
stay where you are for 20 minutes.

23:35.737 --> 23:37.197
Starting now.

23:45.580 --> 23:49.542
Don't load up so much it'll slow you down.
Two extra magazines each.

23:57.842 --> 24:00.136
- All right.
- What d'you need that for?

24:00.303 --> 24:03.640
- Anything moving's gonna get shot.
- What if it's the major?

24:03.807 --> 24:06.476
He'll get hit with a stunner
instead of a P-90.

24:06.643 --> 24:09.771
- What if he sees us first?
- He'll hear you first.

24:09.938 --> 24:12.607
- Are you telling me to shut up again?
- Again.

24:17.696 --> 24:19.781
Right.

24:29.874 --> 24:31.960
Let's go.

24:37.841 --> 24:40.343
Which generator powers
grounding station three?

24:40.510 --> 24:44.139
- You're asking me?
- Whichever one it is, we gotta be there.

24:44.306 --> 24:46.391
- There's one here.
- Is that a guess?

24:46.558 --> 24:49.060
- Aye, but it makes sense.
- It's the closest.

24:49.227 --> 24:52.981
I'll take point. Teyla, on our six.
You, don't open your mouth.

24:53.148 --> 24:56.151
- Only shoot at what I tell you to.
- Don't be so pushy.

24:56.318 --> 24:58.403
That's an order.

25:15.837 --> 25:17.923
<i>(bleeping)</i>

25:31.853 --> 25:33.647
<i>(soldier) Stop!</i>

25:35.815 --> 25:38.652
Look, your boss wanted me
to turn this thing back on.

25:38.818 --> 25:41.655
- I think we should do what he says.
- Be quiet.

25:44.366 --> 25:50.205
- Sora, we have him.
- Keep him alive. I'm on my way.

25:51.790 --> 25:53.875
<i>(bleeping)</i>

26:13.937 --> 26:16.815
- Is it the wrong one?
- Yeah, I'd say so.

26:16.982 --> 26:19.859
Don't you blame me for this.
I'm not an engineer.

26:20.026 --> 26:24.114
I only have a basic understanding
of how Rodney configures the power, so...

26:24.281 --> 26:27.617
You just can't stop talking.
No matter what I say...

26:27.784 --> 26:31.371
You're such a nice lad,
until you're in charge, you cheeky bugger!

26:31.538 --> 26:36.293
Wait. What if this is the right station
and the major has not made it back yet?

26:37.252 --> 26:39.337
She's right.

26:40.463 --> 26:43.174
No. No, this one's working.

26:44.134 --> 26:46.553
- How much time?
- Two minutes.

26:46.720 --> 26:51.141
There's five generators. It's not this one
or the one powering the control tower.

26:51.308 --> 26:54.811
That leaves three. One-in-three chance
of guessing the right one.

26:54.978 --> 26:58.356
We may walk into the ambush
we're trying to save him from.

26:58.523 --> 27:02.152
Are any of the generators
near a transport station?

27:02.319 --> 27:05.071
- Aye, there's two.
- Let's go.

27:16.499 --> 27:19.836
- OK, now, if I remember correctly...
- Remember correctly.

27:20.003 --> 27:23.965
- I think they're here and here.
- Which one is next to a generator?

27:24.132 --> 27:26.259
- Give me a moment.
- Pick one!

27:26.426 --> 27:29.888
- I'm the one you're gonna blame.
- We have to go now.

27:32.057 --> 27:34.142
Here.

27:36.978 --> 27:41.942
I don't mean to be bad, but Kolya'll kill my
people if I don't get this turned back on.

27:42.108 --> 27:43.652
Turn around.

27:54.913 --> 27:57.457
- You turn around.
- What?

27:58.291 --> 28:01.753
If I have to turn around,
you should turn around.

28:04.839 --> 28:07.217
- What took you so long?
- The storm...

28:07.384 --> 28:09.469
Hold that thought.

28:17.769 --> 28:20.689
It seems Major Sheppard
wants you to live.

28:20.855 --> 28:22.941
Let's get back to work.

28:33.827 --> 28:36.997
<i>- (Ford) You OK, sir?
- (Sheppard) Been better, been worse.</i>

28:37.163 --> 28:39.624
- Shoulder's sore.
- Want me to take a look?

28:39.791 --> 28:43.378
- Take a rain check, Doc.
- We should leave. More Genii will come.

28:43.545 --> 28:45.630
<i>(Beckett) I couldn't agree more.</i>

29:03.106 --> 29:05.734
- If this doesn't work...
- It will.

29:05.901 --> 29:08.653
- I'm just saying, if it doesn't work...
- It will.

29:08.820 --> 29:12.991
- I'm sure it will, but if it doesn't...
- Rodney.

29:14.784 --> 29:16.411
Please.

29:24.127 --> 29:26.212
<i>(whirring)</i>

29:48.902 --> 29:52.030
- Fantastic.
- Oh, thank God.

29:57.494 --> 30:00.538
McKay figures he can harness
the storm's lightning.

30:00.705 --> 30:04.167
- This lightning?
- SG teams have done it before.

30:04.334 --> 30:07.796
- There's a big difference...
- I didn't say you could talk.

30:13.843 --> 30:16.763
Now... I need to run the sub-routine

30:16.930 --> 30:19.766
that will convince the buffer
to the shield generator

30:19.933 --> 30:22.686
to attenuate the raw electricity
into useful power.

30:22.852 --> 30:27.440
I can only do that from the control room,
using Dr Weir's codes.

30:27.607 --> 30:29.317
Yes.

30:29.484 --> 30:33.488
Only primary systems are operating.
Sheppard has to repair the generators.

30:33.655 --> 30:39.327
The shield's considered a primary system.
We're good to go, but we have to go now.

30:39.494 --> 30:42.706
I mean now, I mean everybody,
all your men.

30:42.872 --> 30:45.125
What does that have to do with my men?

30:45.292 --> 30:47.502
Now the grounding station's deactivated,

30:47.669 --> 30:52.716
electricity will flow through the conduits
that line every corridor in the city.

30:52.882 --> 30:56.636
- What kind of plan is that?
- A McKay kind of plan. It's all we got.

30:56.803 --> 31:01.433
- It leaves us only one place to go.
- Where the Genii will also be.

31:01.600 --> 31:05.228
The control room and Stargate operations
are shielded.

31:05.395 --> 31:09.566
The rest of the city...
once lightning starts to hit...

31:09.733 --> 31:13.528
Anybody left in the hallway
is as good as dead.

31:29.711 --> 31:32.505
<i>- Why haven't you responded?
- (Sora) She's here.</i>

31:32.672 --> 31:35.592
- Who?
- Teyla and two others joined Sheppard.

31:35.759 --> 31:40.138
Why wasn't this reported sooner?
Fall back to the control room immediately.

31:40.305 --> 31:43.225
She's just out of my reach. If I'm patient...

31:43.391 --> 31:46.811
<i>- I gave you an order.
- She left my father for dead.</i>

31:46.978 --> 31:49.272
The storm is upon us.
The city's not safe.

31:49.439 --> 31:53.652
- I don't care.
- Fall back. Your father will be avenged.

31:53.818 --> 31:56.738
<i>- By me.
- Sora...</i>

32:01.284 --> 32:05.997
- Will the hunters in the jumper be safe?
- Jumper bay's part of Stargate operations.

32:06.164 --> 32:10.252
- That's where we should be headed.
- Weir and McKay will be expendable.

32:10.418 --> 32:15.006
- We gotta take the control room first.
- Would he kill them for being of no use?

32:15.173 --> 32:18.551
No, he'd kill them to punish me.
Here's the deal.

32:18.718 --> 32:22.097
Ford and I go to the control room.
You head to the jumper bay.

32:22.264 --> 32:26.226
- I intend to fight alongside you.
- I intend you to fight with us.

32:26.393 --> 32:29.479
Lower the ship into the gate room.
Open the weapons pods.

32:29.646 --> 32:32.148
Should be enough distraction
for us to go in.

32:32.315 --> 32:37.279
We take the control room, get the shield
up, city saved, Weir and McKay saved...

32:37.445 --> 32:39.322
take the rest of the day off.

32:39.489 --> 32:43.034
- Sounds like a plan, sir.
- Stay on channel two. Let's move out.

32:43.201 --> 32:46.788
You're not gonna need that thing.
Shoot to kill.

32:54.546 --> 32:58.300
The winds are getting stronger
and the wave heights are growing.

32:58.466 --> 33:00.552
- We need to keep stalling.
- What for?

33:00.719 --> 33:04.180
- Major Sheppard is still out there.
- Now, McKay.

33:04.347 --> 33:07.058
It's done. Dr Weir,
I need to enter your codes.

33:08.768 --> 33:11.605
Yes, of course.

33:11.771 --> 33:14.190
79...

33:14.357 --> 33:16.693
421.

33:16.860 --> 33:19.613
Yes?

33:19.779 --> 33:23.909
- 03245.
- And the second sequence?

33:29.414 --> 33:32.042
I'll be glad when following orders is over...

33:34.628 --> 33:37.047
Drop it!

33:38.131 --> 33:40.216
I'll kill him.

33:48.475 --> 33:51.019
I would hate to kill you so quickly.

33:52.479 --> 33:55.732
I've known you almost all your life.
Why are you doing this?

33:55.899 --> 33:58.485
- You left him to die.
- He killed an innocent.

33:58.652 --> 34:02.113
- He alerted the Wraith to our presence.
- And you escaped.

34:02.280 --> 34:04.616
If I am to die by your hand, Sora,

34:04.783 --> 34:09.579
I die knowing there was nothing
I could have done to have saved Tyrus.

34:15.335 --> 34:17.420
We're in position.

34:19.922 --> 34:23.342
- This isn't right.
- What?

34:23.510 --> 34:26.346
They should have made it
to the jumper bay first.

34:26.513 --> 34:28.556
They should have been waiting for us.

34:28.723 --> 34:30.809
Teyla, what's your position?

34:32.643 --> 34:34.853
Teyla?

34:36.690 --> 34:41.319
This was my father's.
It was handed down from his father.

34:43.446 --> 34:46.741
If you want to fight this way,
Sora, I will win.

34:46.908 --> 34:49.995
You will have avenged no one.

34:50.161 --> 34:51.871
We'll see.

35:03.300 --> 35:05.343
- Engage the shield.
- Almost finished.

35:05.510 --> 35:08.013
<i>- (bleeping)
- A massive wave is approaching.</i>

35:08.179 --> 35:10.223
- Without the shield...
- McKay.

35:14.895 --> 35:19.065
We're getting hits on the northern pier.
Routing power to the corridor now.

35:22.444 --> 35:24.654
Now.

35:26.072 --> 35:28.533
Now.

35:29.868 --> 35:32.746
- OK, this is a problem.
- What?

35:33.622 --> 35:35.707
I told you this was a long shot.

35:35.874 --> 35:38.835
We have serious flooding
on the north and west piers.

35:39.002 --> 35:42.213
The city conduits just can't handle
this kind of raw power.

35:42.380 --> 35:45.759
- Is any power getting to the shield?
- Nowhere near enough.

35:45.926 --> 35:49.471
- You said this would work.
- I'm an extremely arrogant man.

35:49.638 --> 35:52.557
I tend to think all of my plans will work.

35:54.601 --> 35:58.355
<i>- Idiot!
- (Weir) This was a long shot at best.</i>

35:58.521 --> 36:01.274
Why else would we evacuate the city?

36:01.441 --> 36:05.320
It was always our intention
to dial out in case this didn't work.

36:06.905 --> 36:09.282
Within minutes, Atlantis will fail.

36:10.867 --> 36:14.496
You can leave and survive,
or you can go down with the city.

36:18.750 --> 36:21.253
You choose.

36:53.618 --> 36:55.662
Ow!

37:03.420 --> 37:05.880
We're not getting enough power
to the shield.

37:06.047 --> 37:08.925
Are you gonna sacrifice
the lives of all of your men

37:09.092 --> 37:13.763
on the off chance that this city
won't be completely destroyed?

37:17.475 --> 37:20.937
Open the Stargate.
Start evacuating the remaining men.

37:22.355 --> 37:25.609
- You're making the right decision.
- You're coming with us.

37:25.775 --> 37:27.444
What?

37:27.611 --> 37:30.822
- As payment for what you've done.
- What we've done?

37:59.309 --> 38:01.394
Change of plan.

38:07.275 --> 38:09.819
- You get McKay.
- This is a bad idea!

38:09.986 --> 38:12.989
You saw what happened with my last plan.
This is not...

38:19.955 --> 38:23.250
You're not going anywhere.

38:24.626 --> 38:27.045
I will shoot you if you don't let her go.

38:28.755 --> 38:31.174
And risk hurting Dr Weir?

38:33.718 --> 38:36.179
I'm not aiming at her.

38:42.727 --> 38:46.856
Find Teyla and Beckett. Make sure
that's all of 'em. Sorry. I had to...

38:47.023 --> 38:49.859
- You OK?
- No.

38:50.026 --> 38:52.946
You will be. Come on.

38:59.160 --> 39:02.664
- What are you doing?
- I thought I'd activate the shield.

39:02.831 --> 39:07.627
- Teyla and Beckett are still out there.
- There's a tsunami heading for the city.

39:07.794 --> 39:12.215
- In two and a half minutes they're dead.
- Then give 'em two minutes.

39:31.651 --> 39:34.279
This is not what your father
would have wanted.

39:34.446 --> 39:39.743
<i>- Our people were destined to be allies.
- (Sheppard) Fall back to the control room.</i>

39:39.910 --> 39:42.954
This must end now!

39:43.121 --> 39:45.206
Then end it!

40:04.184 --> 40:07.854
There's no more time.
We either lose them or we lose the city.

40:11.274 --> 40:13.735
- Rodney, go!
- Going!

40:31.419 --> 40:34.923
- What's happening?
- It just needs to build up enough power.

40:35.090 --> 40:37.384
Wait for it.

40:44.057 --> 40:45.433
Carson.

40:45.600 --> 40:48.228
- Rodney.
- Just in time to see how this ends.

40:56.319 --> 40:58.405
Now!

41:09.499 --> 41:12.335
- Nice work, Rodney.
- Did you ever doubt me?

41:12.502 --> 41:15.630
Yes, several times.

41:15.797 --> 41:18.717
I see you've made a new friend, Teyla.

41:31.813 --> 41:34.983
- What do you wanna do with her?
- I don't know yet.

41:35.150 --> 41:37.819
We'll keep her locked up
for the time being.

41:37.986 --> 41:41.072
Maybe releasing her to the Genii
would help ease tension.

41:41.239 --> 41:43.658
You're extremely optimistic,
you know that?

41:43.825 --> 41:46.661
- You think so?
- Everyone getting back OK?

41:46.828 --> 41:50.248
- Looks like it.
- How fares our city?

41:50.415 --> 41:53.460
We're pumping out
the lower levels of the east pier.

41:53.627 --> 41:55.962
There is structural damage.
Nothing serious.

41:56.129 --> 42:00.258
Beckett suffered from a minor concussion.
I had to do this myself.

42:00.425 --> 42:04.179
Still, on the bright side,
I've had my first decent meal in 24 hours,

42:04.346 --> 42:07.933
so, all things considered,
I would say we are just fine.

42:08.099 --> 42:11.603
- These things happen every 20 years?
