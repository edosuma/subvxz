00:03.000 --> 00:06.120
If you're gonna do role play,
you have to do it completely.

00:07.320 --> 00:10.000
You have to get every detail right.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.840
Oh, hello.

00:17.680 --> 00:19.600
But it's not just about the clothes.

00:20.040 --> 00:22.840
Or the props. You have to
work out how he wants to feel,

00:23.120 --> 00:26.120
get inside his head. Find the
spark of the fantasy. Fan it.

00:27.440 --> 00:29.360
Till it's on fire.

01:14.480 --> 01:17.120
I have been expecting you.

01:17.155 --> 01:19.080
- Hello, you don't have to start yet.
- Oh.

01:19.115 --> 01:21.165
Right, OK. Sorry.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.080
Come up. It's Flat 23.

01:25.640 --> 01:27.605
I'm actually quite nervous.

01:27.640 --> 01:30.420
He spent as much time thinking
about the detail of this

01:30.455 --> 01:33.200
as the average girl spends
thinking about her wedding.

01:33.235 --> 01:35.160
So... No pressure.

01:40.120 --> 01:42.880
- Hello. I'm Stuart.
- Hi. Come in.

01:44.120 --> 01:46.000
I'm Belle.

01:46.360 --> 01:48.480
- You, erm... you got everything OK?
- I did.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.000
- You look incredible.
- Thank you.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.480
Let me give you this.

02:00.480 --> 02:01.280
Thank you.

02:01.281 --> 02:03.580
So, shall I have a
shower and get changed?

02:03.615 --> 02:06.680
- That'd be great.
- I think it's gonna be really good.

02:07.680 --> 02:09.600
Erm, it's just through there.

02:12.600 --> 02:16.600
Shall I use this as the front door? I'll
knock to come in and then we'll start.

02:16.601 --> 02:17.320
Yeah.

02:17.760 --> 02:19.405
- You know the script?
- I hope so.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.960
Don't worry, you'll be
fine. See you in a minute.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.440
Olga.

02:39.640 --> 02:41.760
What's a nice girl like you

02:41.795 --> 02:43.845
doing in a place like this?

02:43.880 --> 02:46.680
I could
ask the same of you, Mr Bond.

02:46.715 --> 02:49.080
Please, call me James.

02:49.720 --> 02:53.840
Mr Preznakov would like like
to welcome you with a drink.

02:55.360 --> 02:59.760
Are you sure he... he wouldn't
like you to frisk me first?

03:00.000 --> 03:02.520
- Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.
- It's all right, don't worry.

03:02.555 --> 03:04.560
I would like to make sure

03:05.160 --> 03:07.245
you come to us

03:07.280 --> 03:09.160
with the best intentions.

03:12.280 --> 03:14.400
You certainly seem to come to me with...

03:15.080 --> 03:17.040
the best intentions.

03:17.440 --> 03:19.680
A- ha! Now.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.120
The drink.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.045
Dry martini.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.960
Shaken, not stirred.

03:30.240 --> 03:32.160
The secret ingredient.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.720
- Vodka?
- Da.

03:37.320 --> 03:39.640
How do you take it?

03:39.675 --> 03:41.960
Stiff and ice-cold.

03:42.800 --> 03:43.800
Unconventional.

03:44.200 --> 03:47.200
Why don't we enjoy these
drinks somewhere more...

03:47.400 --> 03:49.320
...comfortable?

03:56.640 --> 03:58.560
Mm.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.360
Now, Mr Bond.

04:02.760 --> 04:04.680
Let me show you

04:04.960 --> 04:08.120
some Russian hospitality.

04:11.560 --> 04:16.140
Perhaps your hospitality could
extend to a discussion about

04:16.175 --> 04:20.720
Mr Preznakov's plans for his
mining interests in Siberia.

04:22.760 --> 04:25.880
I thought something was
sp-spoiling the line of the dress.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.980
Oh, the drink...

04:40.015 --> 04:41.960
I... I feel woozy.

04:43.720 --> 04:45.725
Sorry.

04:48.240 --> 04:53.160
Make it stop. Fetch my
adrenaline shot from my jacket.

04:53.195 --> 04:55.240
I won't have you taking advantage of me.

04:56.920 --> 04:58.800
I'm being tracked from London.

04:59.200 --> 05:01.245
They know just where I am.

05:01.280 --> 05:03.160
I have you at my mercy, Mr Bond.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.685
- In Russia...
- The drink...

05:17.720 --> 05:20.640
...we say it is the men
who are the weaker sex.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.240
Now we shall be... unstoppable.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.760
Olga?

05:48.795 --> 05:50.640
Olga!

05:57.000 --> 05:59.365
Why have you returned?

05:59.400 --> 06:01.920
Oh, it's OK. We've stopped, Belle.

06:01.955 --> 06:04.085
What? Oh, sorry!

06:04.120 --> 06:06.480
No, don't be. That was incredible.

06:06.515 --> 06:08.405
You, you were magic.

06:08.440 --> 06:10.680
I was worried I would
get something wrong.

06:10.715 --> 06:13.285
Not at all. I mean, you gave it 500%.

06:13.320 --> 06:14.320
Oh, thanks.

06:14.321 --> 06:16.800
No, thank you for all the hard
work. I really appreciate it.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.600
Think nothing of it.
I really enjoyed myself.

06:19.635 --> 06:22.120
Great. Yeah, thought you did. Great.

06:22.960 --> 06:26.600
I was wondering, could I
book another appointment?

06:26.635 --> 06:28.365
Sure.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.360
Have you seen The Prisoner?

06:32.160 --> 06:34.280
- I'll get the box set.
- Brilliant.

06:38.920 --> 06:41.280
Duncan's taking me to the opera.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.320
I know. But I'm gonna be really into it.

06:45.355 --> 06:48.440
For all four hours.

06:49.360 --> 06:51.280
500%.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.960
- Hey.
- Hello.

06:58.560 --> 07:00.480
This is Duncan.

07:00.515 --> 07:02.400
Right. Hello.

07:04.400 --> 07:07.000
You guys didn't need to
dress up for little old me.

07:07.440 --> 07:09.400
I'm taking her to the opera.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.840
- Lovely.
- It's great to meet you finally.

07:12.875 --> 07:14.720
I've heard a lot about you.

07:14.960 --> 07:16.880
As have I about you.

07:18.680 --> 07:20.325
Great.

07:20.360 --> 07:22.445
So what can I get you?

07:22.480 --> 07:25.280
- Erm... red? - Mm.
- Do you have a wine list?

07:25.315 --> 07:27.160
We do.

07:27.520 --> 07:29.925
May I recommend you one? OK.

07:29.960 --> 07:32.125
- The Malbec's really good.
- Hmm.

07:32.160 --> 07:35.400
No, I think two glasses of
the Blaufrankisch, please.

07:36.800 --> 07:40.200
- Actually, that's only by the bottle.
- That's OK. Bottle's fine.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.640
So how's work?

07:46.440 --> 07:48.600
Work's work.
Would you like to try this?

07:48.601 --> 07:49.801
No, I'm sure it'll be great.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.320
Thanks.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.520
Mm.

08:12.040 --> 08:14.480
So, Hannah tells me that
the book was your idea?

08:17.920 --> 08:19.645
Not really.

08:19.680 --> 08:22.360
- No, it was.
- She should give you a finder's fee.

08:24.960 --> 08:28.560
Really, I'm fine. Excuse me.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.080
- He seems nice.
- Yeah.

08:32.559 --> 08:33.559
Is he all right?

08:33.561 --> 08:36.100
Yeah, I think he's
just got a bit of PMT.

08:38.520 --> 08:40.480
Well. Cheers.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.720
- Here's to a great night.
- Cheers.

08:46.040 --> 08:47.960
Oh, great.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.160
- Byron, hello.
- Hi. Duncan.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.085
Byron's, erm...

08:56.120 --> 08:58.100
- Byron's going out...
- Engaged to.

08:58.135 --> 09:00.080
- Engaged to a friend of mine.
- Yeah.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.205
She's got an appointment.

09:03.240 --> 09:06.200
She said she'd be there for
ages so I thought I'd come here.

09:06.560 --> 09:09.480
It's a bit confusing sometimes,
going out with a prositute.

09:09.515 --> 09:11.400
Do you find it confusing?

09:12.320 --> 09:14.280
- Well...
- What a question.

09:16.320 --> 09:19.400
- I actually don't.
- We're going to Harbay's tonight.

09:19.435 --> 09:21.920
So, everything all right
with your wine, Duncan?

09:22.200 --> 09:24.160
Yes, thank you. It's delicious.

09:24.195 --> 09:26.120
I'm really glad to hear that.

09:27.840 --> 09:30.125
Actually, we should probably leave.

09:30.160 --> 09:32.200
Yeah, you wouldn't wanna miss the opera.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.765
No.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.965
- Well, hope you enjoy it.
- We will.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.240
- Thanks for the drink.
- Oh, thanks for the tip.

09:39.960 --> 09:41.880
Thanks for the support.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.965
Thanks for bringing me.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.240
- Enjoying it?
- Very much.

10:00.880 --> 10:04.480
- You?
- Yeah, the music's... great.

10:05.840 --> 10:09.840
So you, er, you like Gunag...?

10:10.760 --> 10:13.400
Honestly, I don't really
know that much about him.

10:14.520 --> 10:16.440
I thought you were really into it.

10:17.240 --> 10:19.245
I thought YOU were.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.640
- Not really, no.
- Huh.

10:22.560 --> 10:24.100
In your book you say it's frustrating

10:24.101 --> 10:26.760
you only get to see the
first half of an opera.

10:26.795 --> 10:29.280
Cos the client always wants
to go back to the hotel.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.000
So I thought I'd bring you along
and you could see the whole thing.

10:32.001 --> 10:35.641
Baby, you did it for me!

10:36.640 --> 10:38.560
You hate it, don't you?

10:38.840 --> 10:40.245
But...

10:40.280 --> 10:42.445
I'm staying for the second half.

10:42.480 --> 10:45.060
I'm going to stand in
solidarity with all the escorts

10:45.095 --> 10:47.640
who never get to find out
what happens in the end.

10:47.675 --> 10:49.640
- I hate it too.
- Great. He dies in the end.

10:50.680 --> 10:52.845
Let's finish these, get out of here,

10:52.880 --> 10:55.760
- then you can tell me all about 007.
- OK, deal.

10:56.080 --> 10:58.680
So how many operas have
you seen the first half of?

10:59.280 --> 11:02.280
Pretty much all of them. We
get brought here all the time.

11:04.440 --> 11:08.160
So this bar is full of escorts.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.080
Well, I don't know about full, but yeah.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.760
Go on, then. Where?

11:16.040 --> 11:18.520
- Oh, you wanna play Guess The Escort?
- Yeah, OK.

11:18.880 --> 11:21.200
- OK. Fiver?
- Done. Great.

11:21.235 --> 11:23.520
OK, you first. Quick.

11:23.555 --> 11:25.400
OK...

11:26.520 --> 11:29.560
- Her.
- That's his daughter, you pervert.

11:29.595 --> 11:31.480
Oh, yeah.

11:32.040 --> 11:34.205
Her. Definitely.

11:34.240 --> 11:37.200
- No, I'd pick her over there.
- Really? Yeah.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.845
How do we know who's right?

11:40.880 --> 11:42.800
We'll just see who doesn't go back in.

11:46.320 --> 11:48.800
No, that's good. Look,
they're going back in.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.920
Definitely.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.360
Oh.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.600
Oh.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.440
Cough up.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.640
Thank you.

12:08.440 --> 12:10.360
Shall we?

12:11.520 --> 12:14.360
You know that now we just
look like punter and escort?

12:14.395 --> 12:16.440
- Well, we'll go back in.
- No, no.

12:16.475 --> 12:18.320
Desperate!

12:21.880 --> 12:23.800
Should work somewhere like this.

12:23.835 --> 12:25.680
Really nice.

12:26.280 --> 12:28.440
- Cheerio.
- Cheers.

12:34.160 --> 12:35.885
So.

12:35.920 --> 12:39.920
Did you and Belle used to
be kind of...

12:42.200 --> 12:44.160
Yeah, we might've, er...

12:47.600 --> 12:49.680
That must make it a bit... weird.

12:49.715 --> 12:51.800
Not really.

12:52.560 --> 12:54.405
She's my best mate.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.320
That's good. That's... good.

12:59.920 --> 13:01.880
Why? Do you think we should...?

13:02.120 --> 13:04.125
No.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.080
I don't know.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.600
Just let it go, you think.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.700
Let's finish these up
and get out of here.

13:17.701 --> 13:18.600
Yeah.

13:18.635 --> 13:20.480
After we do shots.

13:21.640 --> 13:23.560
Yeah. After we do shots.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.645
- I'll get a table.
- OK.

13:37.680 --> 13:41.520
Hi. Erm, can I have a bottle of
Burgundy and two glasses, please?

13:41.555 --> 13:43.440
Sure.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.440
Thank you.

13:46.680 --> 13:48.560
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

13:57.840 --> 14:00.000
Ah. Burgundy. Lovely.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.800
What was that?

14:02.835 --> 14:04.800
It doesn't matter.

14:04.835 --> 14:06.605
Who was it?

14:06.640 --> 14:08.520
Did you enjoy the opera?

14:09.040 --> 14:10.960
He's a client.

14:11.360 --> 14:14.200
Yeah, I did. Particularly
enjoyed its brevity.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.920
Me too.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.320
Not... not the Bond guy?

14:23.520 --> 14:25.520
What did you think of the singer?

14:25.555 --> 14:28.397
Er... I thought the tenor

14:28.432 --> 14:31.240
was quite interesting.

14:31.680 --> 14:34.340
But he didn't really look the way

14:34.375 --> 14:37.000
I expected an opera singer to look.

14:37.035 --> 14:38.960
Stop it. Please.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.960
- Do you wanna go and sit over there?
- That'd be great.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.680
- You OK?
- That was quite weird.

14:57.680 --> 15:00.760
I'm fine. Let's just move on.
I'm sorry you had to see him.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.280
You're not gonna be weird, are you?

15:03.315 --> 15:05.160
- No, I'm not gonna be anything.
- OK.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.965
Do you run into clients often?

15:08.000 --> 15:10.440
I actually don't. I think
that was the first time.

15:13.760 --> 15:15.800
- Don't look.
- Sorry, sorry.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.165
It's just, erm...

15:18.200 --> 15:21.085
- ... he's hardly Daniel Craig.
- Can you just leave it?

15:21.120 --> 15:24.320
- Not even Timothy Dalton.
- Right, I'm gonna get a glass of water.

15:35.640 --> 15:37.600
Can I see the wine list, please?

15:41.080 --> 15:43.040
- This is awkward.
- I'm really sorry.

15:44.280 --> 15:46.400
I don't want my wife to notice anything.

15:51.400 --> 15:53.960
Can I get a glass of still
mineral water, please?

15:54.720 --> 15:56.885
We could leave, if it's easier.

15:56.920 --> 15:58.920
No, it's just you keep looking at me.

15:58.955 --> 16:00.885
God, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to.

16:00.920 --> 16:04.360
Of course you didn't. I must admit,
I can't stop thinking about...

16:05.560 --> 16:09.360
Erm, a glass of Sancerre and a
glass of Sierra, please. Thank you.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.960
...stop thinking about our next...

16:12.720 --> 16:15.800
- ... next appointment.
- I'm really looking forward to it too.

16:19.240 --> 16:22.080
- I can send you that box set.
- I've already ordered it.

16:22.115 --> 16:24.920
- You must let me reimburse you.
- Don't worry, it's fine.

16:28.200 --> 16:30.840
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.045
I'm just getting a drink.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.400
It's just, I'm her boyfriend.
She's not at work now.

16:35.401 --> 16:36.001
Duncan!

16:36.900 --> 16:40.700
I don't want to interfere. But it would
be really good if you could respect that.

16:40.701 --> 16:43.900
He does respect it.
Why don't you sit down?

16:43.960 --> 16:45.880
No, I don't want any... Sorry.

16:49.480 --> 16:51.400
Well done. You just lost me a client.

16:55.680 --> 16:58.205
- I was trying to help.
- I don't need rescuing.

16:58.240 --> 17:01.640
- I thought the guy was hassling you.
- You never bust a client. Ever.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.204
- Evening.
- Evening.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.119
Everyone having a good time?

17:06.400 --> 17:09.125
- How's your evening panning out?
- Ben.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.300
Ours is panning out really well.

17:10.300 --> 17:13.079
Some of the best panning I've ever seen.

17:13.079 --> 17:13.700
Please, not now.

17:14.099 --> 17:15.900
Look, mate, why don't you
go and sit somewhere else?

17:15.901 --> 17:16.901
Listen, mate.

17:19.240 --> 17:21.645
Mate. We wanna talk to you.

17:21.680 --> 17:23.200
- Yeah, we did. We did.
- Yeah.

17:23.201 --> 17:23.800
Ben.

17:24.839 --> 17:27.005
- We wanted to talk to you.
- We did.

17:27.040 --> 17:30.080
- What are you doing here?
- We wanted to talk to you, actually.

17:31.360 --> 17:33.280
We've written a book too.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.120
Erm... It's called...

17:36.920 --> 17:38.840
- Duncan is a prick.
- Oh, you wanker.

17:39.480 --> 17:42.300
- And inside we did...
- A picture of a prick.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.845
I'd never do this to you.

17:45.880 --> 17:48.040
Never intrude on a
relationship of yours.

17:49.320 --> 17:52.700
- What about when I fucked your sister?
- Is your sister a prostitute too?

17:52.701 --> 17:53.301
Ben.

17:53.302 --> 17:55.700
Hey, I'm just trying
to have a quiet drink?

17:56.200 --> 17:58.080
All right? Don't manhandle him.

17:59.160 --> 18:01.325
He's my best man.

18:01.360 --> 18:03.200
- He's my best man.
- Really?

18:03.201 --> 18:04.125
- Is that OK?
- Yeah!

18:04.160 --> 18:06.800
- Please, would you just leave?
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.760
We're just gonna have a quiet drink.

18:11.320 --> 18:13.925
Look, Ben, I don't know
what I've done to you, but

18:13.960 --> 18:17.400
why don't we sit down when you're
a bit more sober and have a coffee?

18:18.280 --> 18:20.285
I'm...

18:20.320 --> 18:22.840
You're sober. I might be...

18:23.080 --> 18:25.040
But in the morning...

18:27.400 --> 18:29.320
...I'll be sober.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.960
Yeah.

18:32.560 --> 18:34.480
- Right. We're leaving now?
- Yeah.

18:35.960 --> 18:38.205
This isn't over.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.000
You're probably right.

18:39.001 --> 18:42.300
Why don't you stay and have a
drink? Get your sister along?

18:45.560 --> 18:47.440
Ooh! Another round?

18:49.440 --> 18:51.400
Yeah.

19:45.160 --> 19:47.120
Have you got anything to say?

19:51.680 --> 19:55.040
- I'm sorry if your night was spoilt.
- It was spoilt, yeah. It was.

19:57.120 --> 19:59.040
I don't remember what happened.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.120
You're gonna apologise.

20:06.560 --> 20:08.440
- I have apologised.
- No, you haven't.

20:10.720 --> 20:14.400
Since this book came out, you're
pretending to be this other person.

20:15.360 --> 20:16.900
Going to the Opera, hanging
out with people like him.

20:16.901 --> 20:19.520
You should remember who
your real friends are.

20:19.555 --> 20:21.000
I can't believe you're trying
to making this about me.

20:21.001 --> 20:22.400
Yeah, that's usually your job, isn't it?

20:23.312 --> 20:27.000
- That's nice, Ben. I'll see you later.
- Fine, go. I give up on you, Hannah.

20:27.035 --> 20:29.040
- Completely.
- You know what? I give up on you.

20:29.075 --> 20:31.000
I've had enough! I just give up.

20:37.720 --> 20:40.300
I've spent all this time
writing about clients,

20:40.335 --> 20:42.845
but I wonder what it's
like to BE a client.

20:42.880 --> 20:46.400
I wish I could be reckless and act
like a prick every now and again.

20:46.435 --> 20:48.400
But running a company, I can't.

20:48.435 --> 20:50.360
Just research.

20:50.960 --> 20:53.360
Duncan'll be fine about it. Won't he?

20:54.361 --> 20:57.861
