WEBVTT

00:07.578 --> 00:10.611
WE'RE GONNA BE IN SO MUCH
TROUBLE WITH MR. DAVENPORT.

00:10.611 --> 00:11.682
WE'RE TWO HOURS PAST CURFEW,

00:11.682 --> 00:13.684
AND LIGHTS ARE ALREADY OFF.

00:13.684 --> 00:16.617
WE ARE BIONIC TEENAGERS
WHO GO ON

00:16.617 --> 00:18.119
TOP SECRET MISSIONS.

00:18.119 --> 00:20.221
I'M PRETTY SURE WE CAN SNEAK
PAST AN OUT-OF-SHAPE,

00:20.221 --> 00:22.053
MIDDLE-AGED MAN.

00:22.053 --> 00:23.594
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
JUST TO BE SAFE,

00:23.594 --> 00:27.228
I'LL USE MY BIONIC VISION
TO SCAN INSIDE.

00:27.228 --> 00:30.431
( trilling sound )

00:33.334 --> 00:34.535
ALL CLEAR.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.506
THEY MUST BE ASLEEP.

00:35.506 --> 00:37.668
GOOD, BUT WE'VE GOT
TO BE SUPER QUIET.

00:37.668 --> 00:39.570
SNEAKIN' IN AFTER CURFEW.

00:39.570 --> 00:42.543
THIS'LL TOTALLY BOOST
MY BAD BOY CRED.

00:44.175 --> 00:46.517
TIPPY TOES, PEOPLE,
TIPPY TOES.

00:46.517 --> 00:49.680
SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE
BAD BOY.

00:58.529 --> 00:59.730
Davenport: BUSTED!

00:59.730 --> 01:01.392
( all scream )

01:03.664 --> 01:05.336
( all scream )

01:05.336 --> 01:06.597
HA!

01:06.597 --> 01:09.270
I DON'T GET IT!
I SCANNED THE ROOM!

01:09.270 --> 01:12.573
MM-HMM, AND I FOILED YOU
WITH MY INVISIBILITY CLOAK!

01:12.573 --> 01:15.576
AGAIN I SAY, "HA!"

01:15.576 --> 01:18.749
WELL, YOU GOT US.

01:18.749 --> 01:20.281
GOOD NIGHT.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.513
FREEZE!

01:22.513 --> 01:25.756
YOU ARE ALL GROUNDED.
THREE WEEKS.

01:25.756 --> 01:27.618
WHAT?!
 THAT'S NOT FAIR!

01:27.618 --> 01:30.761
COME ON!
 IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?

01:30.761 --> 01:33.524
LOOK, YOU GUYS HAVE
NO IDEA WHAT IT'S LIKE

01:33.524 --> 01:35.366
RAISING TEENAGERS.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.529
HE CAN'T GROUND ME
IF HE CAN'T SEE ME!

01:43.774 --> 01:46.337
AAHHH!

01:47.678 --> 01:51.512
I DIDN'T GRAB
THE INVISIBILITY
CLOAK, DID I?

01:51.512 --> 01:54.545
THE WORLD'S FIRST BIONIC
SUPER-HUMANS.

01:54.545 --> 01:58.649
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,
FASTER, SMARTER.

01:58.649 --> 02:01.392
THE NEXT GENERATION
OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

02:01.392 --> 02:03.354
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?

02:03.354 --> 02:04.695
♪♪

02:06.257 --> 02:08.127
♪ LAB RATS ♪

02:09.560 --> 02:11.662
♪ LAB RATS ♪

02:20.611 --> 02:22.273
♪ LAB RATS ♪

02:24.275 --> 02:26.377
♪ LAB RATS ♪

02:32.723 --> 02:34.685
♪ LAB RATS ♪

02:42.493 --> 02:45.866
I HATE BEING GROUNDED.
IS THE THREE WEEKS
OVER YET?

02:45.866 --> 02:49.470
IT HASN'T EVEN BEEN
A DAY.

02:49.470 --> 02:53.504
GUYS! GUYS! I DID IT!
I FINALLY DID IT!

02:53.504 --> 02:55.476
GRADUATED TO BIG BOY SHOES?

02:56.547 --> 02:58.479
NO. I FINALLY ACHIEVED
SOMETHING

02:58.479 --> 03:00.511
I HAVE WANTED MY WHOLE LIFE.

03:00.511 --> 03:05.916
I WON THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL
FOR SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENT!

03:05.916 --> 03:07.558
MM. THAT'S GREAT.

03:07.558 --> 03:10.591
I THINK I GOT ONE OF THOSE
FOR DOING PULL-UPS IN GYM CLASS.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.393
I DON'T THINK SO.

03:12.393 --> 03:16.527
OH, YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT WAS PUSHUPS.

03:16.527 --> 03:19.530
THIS IS THE HIGHEST HONOR
A SCIENTIST CAN RECEIVE.

03:19.530 --> 03:22.202
MY PICTURE'S GONNA BE PLASTERED
ONLINE AND OFFLINE.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.775
IF THERE'S A LINE,
MY FACE IS GONNA BE ON IT.

03:26.407 --> 03:27.408
WHAT DID YOU WIN IT FOR?

03:27.408 --> 03:28.939
MY NEURAL SCRAMBLER.

03:28.939 --> 03:30.911
THIS THING IS GOING
TO REVOLUTIONIZE

03:30.911 --> 03:32.583
THE FIELD OF NEUROLOGY.

03:32.583 --> 03:34.615
HUH?
 THE BRAIN.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.447
OHH!

03:36.447 --> 03:37.748
HOW DOES IT WORK?

03:37.748 --> 03:39.450
IT CAN ERASE SPECIFIED
TIME INCREMENTS

03:39.450 --> 03:42.353
OF NEURAL ASSOCIATIONS
IN THE CEREBRAL CORTEX.

03:42.353 --> 03:44.295
HUH?
 THE BRAIN!

03:44.295 --> 03:45.996
OHH!

03:45.996 --> 03:49.560
BASICALLY, IT HELPS DOCTORS
ERASE BAD MEMORIES.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.532
THAT'S COOL. DOES IT
ERASE ALL MEMORIES,

03:51.532 --> 03:56.367
OR CAN IT JUST ZERO IN
ON... THAT?

03:56.367 --> 03:57.838
CONGRATS, DONALD!

03:57.838 --> 04:01.272
I GOT YOUR TEXT
ABOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL AWARD!

04:01.272 --> 04:04.415
GOSH, THIS IS SO EXCITING.
WHAT A BIG BREAK FOR US.

04:04.415 --> 04:06.377
"US"?

04:06.377 --> 04:07.718
I WAS THINKING I COULD
INTERVIEW YOU

04:07.718 --> 04:09.420
FOR MY TV STATION.

04:09.420 --> 04:12.983
"LOCAL REPORTER LANDS
PRESIDENTIAL AWARD WINNER."

04:12.983 --> 04:14.855
TASHA DAVENPORT EXCLUSIVE.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.358
THIS COULD BE
A REALLY BIG BREAK.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.790
WELL, IT WOULD BE A REALLY
BIG BREAK FOR YOU.

04:19.790 --> 04:22.533
I MEAN, IT WOULD REALLY
HELP YOUR FALTERING CAREER.

04:22.533 --> 04:26.036
NO, I MEAN YOU'D REALLY
GET TO COVER SOMETHING
THAT FINALLY MATTERS.

04:26.036 --> 04:28.869
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU HAVE
GOT YOURSELF AN INTERVIEW.

04:30.401 --> 04:32.543
AND A NEW PAIR OF SHOES.

04:32.543 --> 04:35.576
JUST TAKE MY WALLET.
JUST TAKE THAT.

04:36.677 --> 04:39.410
HAS IT BEEN
THREE WEEKS YET?

04:39.410 --> 04:40.481
STOP!

04:40.481 --> 04:41.752
I HATE BEING GROUNDED!

04:41.752 --> 04:44.515
I AM MISSING STELLA JORDAN'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY,

04:44.515 --> 04:49.560
AND I SO WANTED TO BE THERE
WHEN SHE DOESN'T GET A CAR!

04:49.560 --> 04:51.662
GUYS, I HAVE AN IDEA.

04:51.662 --> 04:54.495
WE CAN USE
THE NEURAL SCRAMBLER

04:54.495 --> 04:57.027
TO ERASE 24 HOURS OF
MR. DAVENPORT'S MEMORY.

04:57.027 --> 05:01.432
WAIT. SNEAKING IN PAST CURFEW,
DISOBEYING AUTHORITY--

05:01.432 --> 05:04.304
WHO ARE YOU, AND WHAT
HAVE YOU DONE WITH CHASE?

05:05.506 --> 05:07.408
NO, I SEE WHERE HE'S
GOING WITH THIS.

05:07.408 --> 05:10.411
MR. DAVENPORT WILL FORGET
HE BROUGHT GROCERIES YESTERDAY,

05:10.411 --> 05:14.685
HE'LL GO AGAIN TODAY,
AND WE'LL HAVE DOUBLE THE FOOD!

05:16.347 --> 05:18.419
OR...

05:18.419 --> 05:20.691
HE'LL TOTALLY FORGET
HE GROUNDED US.

05:20.691 --> 05:23.354
WE'LL SEE WHICH ONE
PANS OUT.

05:23.354 --> 05:25.926
LOOK, I THINK THIS IS
REALLY RISKY.

05:25.926 --> 05:29.360
IF DAVENPORT CATCHES US,
WE WILL BE GROUNDED FOR LIFE.

05:29.360 --> 05:32.102
BUT IF HE DOESN'T,
WE'LL NEVER GET
GROUNDED AGAIN.

05:32.102 --> 05:35.736
PLUS...
DOUBLE THE GROCERIES!

05:37.438 --> 05:39.410
WAIT, SO WE'RE JUST
GONNA ZAP THE GUY?

05:39.410 --> 05:41.542
DON'T WORRY,
IT'S PERFECTLY SAFE.

05:41.542 --> 05:42.643
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

05:42.643 --> 05:46.577
BREE, PLEASE.
I'M THE SMARTEST
GUY IN THE WORLD.

05:46.577 --> 05:48.579
YOU HAVE NO IDEA,
DO YOU?

05:48.579 --> 05:50.421
NOPE. JUST WANT TO GET
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

05:50.421 --> 05:51.882
OKAY.

05:51.882 --> 05:54.485
CALIBRATING TO 24 HOURS.

05:58.389 --> 05:59.690
HEY, THERE,
WHAT YOU READIN'?

05:59.690 --> 06:01.732
OH, UH, I'M ALMOST FINISHED
WITH THIS BIOGRAPHY

06:01.732 --> 06:03.964
ON THE GUY WHO WAS BORN
I GUESS THE COUSIN

06:03.964 --> 06:05.936
OF THE QUEEN OF SPAIN...

06:05.936 --> 06:07.438
FASCINATING.

06:08.969 --> 06:11.442
THAT'S WEIRD. JUST LOST
MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT.

06:11.442 --> 06:14.004
OH, UM, I-- I...

06:14.004 --> 06:18.048
JUST ASKED YOU IF I COULD
GO TO STELLA JORDAN'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY.

06:18.048 --> 06:21.582
OF COURSE YOU CAN.
 YES, IT WORKED! YES!

06:21.582 --> 06:22.883
WHAT WORKED?

06:22.883 --> 06:24.415
WE JUST ZAPPED YOUR BRAIN
WITH YOUR THING...

06:24.415 --> 06:25.816
AND ERASED YOUR MEMORY!

06:25.816 --> 06:30.561
ERASED MY MEMORY?
HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN MESSING
WITH MY NEURAL SCRAMBLER?

06:30.561 --> 06:31.992
NO!

06:31.992 --> 06:34.965
SET TO 60 SECONDS.

06:34.965 --> 06:38.669
THAT THING IS NOT A TOY.
YOU GUYS ARE GROUNDED FOR--

06:38.669 --> 06:42.402
THAT'S WEIRD.
LOST MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT.

06:44.074 --> 06:46.677
HEY, UM, CAN CHASE AND I
GO TO THE MOVIES?

06:46.677 --> 06:47.808
OF COURSE YOU CAN.

06:47.808 --> 06:50.040
HEY, I WANT
TO TRY THIS.

06:50.040 --> 06:53.514
TRY WHAT?
 MMM, HUMMUS!

06:53.514 --> 06:56.016
ADAM, DON'T DO THAT!
NOW NO ONE CAN EAT...!

06:56.016 --> 06:57.147
OOH, HUMMUS!

06:57.147 --> 06:59.189
( all chuckling )

06:59.189 --> 07:01.652
AND JUST LIKE THAT,
WE'RE FREE.

07:01.652 --> 07:03.824
LATER BIG "D."
WE'RE GOING TO THE MOVIES.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.756
OKAY, BE BACK BY NINE.

07:05.756 --> 07:08.599
YEAH, NINE. RIGHT.

07:08.599 --> 07:12.563
OOH! I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED TO READ THIS!

07:12.563 --> 07:15.105
PAGE ONE. LET'S DO THIS.

07:20.711 --> 07:23.213
HEY, BIG "D," CAN YOU SIGN
MY PROGRESS REPORT FOR ME?

07:23.213 --> 07:25.746
SURE.

07:25.746 --> 07:29.119
WAIT. A "C" IN HISTORY?

07:29.119 --> 07:32.683
YEAH, I LIKE TO START LOW
AND WORK MY WAY UP.

07:32.683 --> 07:34.454
LETS THE TEACHERS KNOW
THEY'RE MAKING AN IMPACT.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.926
IT'S MY WAY OF GIVING BACK.

07:35.926 --> 07:37.728
LEO,

07:37.728 --> 07:39.990
I'VE GOT TO SHOW THIS
TO YOUR MOM.

07:39.990 --> 07:45.235
WELL, I'VE GOT $15.42
IN MY POCKET

07:45.235 --> 07:47.768
THAT SAYS YOU DON'T.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.039
SORRY, LEO.

07:49.039 --> 07:50.771
JUST YESTERDAY,
YOUR MOTHER AND I AGREED

07:50.771 --> 07:54.204
WE WERE GONNA START
CRACKING DOWN ON
YOUR SCHOOLWORK.

07:57.107 --> 07:58.949
YESTERDAY, YOU SAY?
 MM-HMM.

07:58.949 --> 08:01.211
AND WHAT TIME
WAS THAT, EXACTLY?

08:01.211 --> 08:03.514
I DON'T KNOW,
DURING BREAKFAST.

08:03.514 --> 08:07.558
SO, WHAT ARE WE TALKING,
LIKE 24 HOURS AGO?

08:08.659 --> 08:10.220
YES, THAT
SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

08:10.220 --> 08:12.593
HEY, DON'T PLAY WITH THAT.
THAT--

08:13.824 --> 08:16.767
WHOA.

08:16.767 --> 08:18.799
WHAT HAPPENED?
THIS IS WEIRD.

08:18.799 --> 08:21.201
YOU WERE JUST TELLING ME
HOW THRILLED YOU ARE

08:21.201 --> 08:23.734
THAT I'M DOING
SO WELL IN SCHOOL.

08:23.734 --> 08:26.537
WHY WOULD I CARE?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU, DUDE.

08:27.978 --> 08:30.110
DUDE?

08:32.943 --> 08:36.647
TWENTY-FOUR YEARS?!!

08:36.647 --> 08:39.019
WAIT. HOW OLD ARE YOU?

08:39.019 --> 08:40.621
FIFTEEN.

08:40.621 --> 08:41.692
AAAHHH!

08:45.255 --> 08:48.298
UH, GUYS, WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

08:48.298 --> 08:49.930
WHAT IS IT?

08:49.930 --> 08:52.763
ROCKET CHAIR!

08:52.763 --> 08:54.064
( crash )

08:54.064 --> 08:56.266
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

09:05.846 --> 09:07.818
LEO, WHAT IS GOING ON?

09:07.818 --> 09:11.251
YOU KNOW THAT NEURAL THING
THAT WE WERE ALL PLAYING WITH?

09:11.251 --> 09:12.883
YES.

09:12.883 --> 09:14.685
I TRIED TO ERASE 24 HOURS

09:14.685 --> 09:16.556
AND I ACCIDENTALLY ERASED
24 YEARS.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.088
HE'S 15!

09:19.159 --> 09:21.031
WHOO!

09:21.031 --> 09:24.034
THIS PLACE IS SICK!

09:24.034 --> 09:26.236
AND NOW I'M GONNA BE SICK!

09:30.040 --> 09:32.342
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY GAVE HIM
THAT PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL.

09:32.342 --> 09:34.945
THIS THING IS FAULT-Y!

09:34.945 --> 09:37.608
THE DEVICE IS FINE.
YOU'RE THE PROBLEM.

09:37.608 --> 09:39.209
YOU "LEO'ED" THIS UP.

09:39.209 --> 09:41.812
HEY, DON'T YOU TURN
MY NAME INTO A VERB!

09:41.812 --> 09:42.913
OKAY.

09:42.913 --> 09:45.816
WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE,
AND HOW DID I GET HERE?

09:45.816 --> 09:48.619
LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS
A LOT FOR YOU TO TAKE IN,

09:48.619 --> 09:50.991
BUT YOUR BRAIN LOST
24 YEARS OF ITS MEMORY

09:50.991 --> 09:53.263
BECAUSE OF A DEVICE
THAT YOU CREATED.

09:53.263 --> 09:58.699
WHOA!

09:58.699 --> 10:00.771
WHAT'S THAT?

10:00.771 --> 10:02.172
THAT'S MY PHONE.

10:02.172 --> 10:06.276
WHOA.

10:06.276 --> 10:08.939
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
MR. DAVENPORT
IS THE ONLY PERSON

10:08.939 --> 10:10.941
WHO KNOWS HOW THE NEURAL
SCRAMBLER WORKS.

10:10.941 --> 10:13.283
GUYS, RELAX.
MR. DAVENPORT CAN HELP US.

10:13.283 --> 10:14.915
HOW?
 EASY.

10:14.915 --> 10:17.748
WE JUST HAVE
TO WAIT 24 YEARS.

10:18.849 --> 10:20.851
OKAY, LOOK,
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT

10:20.851 --> 10:22.222
HOW TO GET OUR FATHER BACK.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.924
( ringtone playing )

10:23.924 --> 10:25.856
I THINK
YOU GOT A PHONE CALL.

10:30.861 --> 10:32.903
BURN!
I'M A TOTAL TECH WHIZ!

10:32.903 --> 10:34.304
I TOOK THAT THING APART
AND REWIRED IT

10:34.304 --> 10:35.906
AND TURNED IT INTO A ZAPPER!

10:37.708 --> 10:40.210
THAT'S NOT FUNNY!
TURN IT BACK!

10:40.210 --> 10:43.914
I'M SORRY. JUST PUSH "3"
AND IT'LL TURN BACK
TO A REGULAR PHONE.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.119
DOUBLE BURN!

10:50.150 --> 10:52.883
THIS ONE,
NOT TOO BRIGHT.

10:54.154 --> 10:57.788
MAN, I LIKE HIM
MUCH BETTER THIS WAY.
CAN WE KEEP HIM?

10:57.788 --> 11:00.060
ADAM, HE'S NOT A DOG.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.962
OOH! PEANUT BUTTER.

11:04.264 --> 11:07.037
HE'S PRETTY MUCH A DOG.

11:07.037 --> 11:09.800
WE STILL CAN'T KEEP HIM
LIKE THIS!

11:09.800 --> 11:13.904
YEAH, WHEN MY MOM
FINDS OUT SHE'S MARRIED
TO AN IDIOTIC TEENAGER--

11:13.904 --> 11:16.907
OKAY, MAYBE SHE'S
PREPARED FOR THAT.

11:16.907 --> 11:18.779
GUYS!

11:18.779 --> 11:20.150
HEY, WHO'S THAT?
YOUR GRANDMA?

11:22.252 --> 11:23.914
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:23.914 --> 11:25.415

11:27.457 --> 11:29.289
YOU KNOW ME?
WHO ARE YOU?

11:29.289 --> 11:30.791
( exaggerated chuckling )

11:30.791 --> 11:31.862
HE'S KIDDING.

11:31.862 --> 11:33.123
WE'RE PLAYING A GAME,

11:33.123 --> 11:34.895

11:39.199 --> 11:41.772
WHO ARE YOU?

11:41.772 --> 11:43.333
YEAH, MOM.

11:43.333 --> 11:45.035
WHO ARE YOU?

11:45.035 --> 11:48.779
A PERSON WITH NO PATIENCE
FOR STUPID GAMES.

11:50.841 --> 11:52.042
SARCASM.

11:52.042 --> 11:54.444

11:54.444 --> 11:56.747

12:00.150 --> 12:02.923
QUICK! GET HIM OUT OF HERE
BEFORE WE GET BUSTED!

12:02.923 --> 12:03.994
WHERE DO I TAKE HIM?

12:03.994 --> 12:06.426
I DON'T KNOW,
JUST TAKE HIM FOR A WALK!

12:06.426 --> 12:09.760
OH, HE'S TOTALLY A DOG!

12:17.968 --> 12:19.940

12:19.940 --> 12:22.312
YOU'RE RUINING YOUR
MILLION-DOLLAR TECHNOLOGY!

12:22.312 --> 12:25.375
( scoffs ) IF BY "RUINING,"
YOU MEAN "MAKING AWESOME."

12:25.375 --> 12:27.217
YEAH, UNLIKE
THE OTHER DAVENPORT,

12:27.217 --> 12:29.049
THIS ONE INVENTS

FIRE HOSE.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.989
IT WAS GOING TO REVOLUTIONIZE
FIREFIGHTING.

12:38.989 --> 12:42.863
WELL, NOW IT'S GONNA
REVOLUTIONIZE GRILLED MEAT.

13:04.014 --> 13:06.116
WHY CREATE AN ARTIFICIAL ARM

13:06.116 --> 13:08.889
WHEN YOU CAN CREATE
A REAL-LIFE WEDGIE MACHINE?

13:09.960 --> 13:10.921

13:34.414 --> 13:36.086
SORRY.

13:36.086 --> 13:38.118
JUST PUSH THAT LITTLE BUTTON
ON THE BACK.

13:40.250 --> 13:43.053

13:45.856 --> 13:47.597

14:27.968 --> 14:30.070
IT'S DEFINITELY
GONNA GO VIRAL.

14:30.070 --> 14:33.273
I'M GONNA BE ON TV?

TO PRESENT THIS AWARD!

14:51.992 --> 14:53.393

14:53.393 --> 14:56.096
WHO WANTS TO BE WITH
THE MOST POWERFUL MAN
IN THE WORLD

14:56.096 --> 14:58.929
WHEN I CAN BE... HERE?

15:00.100 --> 15:02.102
OKAY, I KNOW
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT'S GOING ON,

15:02.102 --> 15:05.235
BUT I NEED YOU TO GET
THROUGH THIS INTERVIEW
AS IF YOU WERE AN ADULT.

15:05.235 --> 15:07.938
GOT IT.

15:07.938 --> 15:09.579
WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE
A BRITISH ACCENT

15:09.579 --> 15:12.082
OR A FAKE MUSTACHE?
'CAUSE I CAN DO BOTH.

15:12.082 --> 15:13.913
( fake British accent )
HELLO! THIS IS MY FINGER.

15:15.545 --> 15:17.187
AS A GROWNUP WHO KNOWS
ABOUT THESE KIND OF THINGS--

15:17.187 --> 15:18.388

15:18.388 --> 15:21.051

AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW

16:13.603 --> 16:15.105
WITH MR. DONALD DAVENPORT,

16:15.105 --> 16:18.448
WINNER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL
MEDAL FOR SCIENTIFIC
ACHIEVEMENT.

16:18.448 --> 16:21.711
I ALSO WON A TEE-BALL
TROPHY WITH A GUY ON IT
THAT GOES LIKE THIS.

16:24.714 --> 16:26.116
RIGHT.

16:26.116 --> 16:29.419
WE'LL GET TO YOUR
CHILDHOOD SHORTLY.

16:29.419 --> 16:31.761
NOW WHAT MOST PEOPLE
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS,

16:31.761 --> 16:33.493
HOW DID YOU, UH...?

UM...

16:37.297 --> 16:39.169
DONALD!

16:40.770 --> 16:44.604
IS HE ALL RIGHT, OR AM I
GONNA HAVE TO SCRAMBLE
A COUPLE OF FIGHTER JETS?

16:46.236 --> 16:50.009
HE'S FINE.
HE RARELY DOES INTERVIEWS.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.681
WHAT A SURPRISE.

16:51.681 --> 16:54.013
SOMETIMES
WHEN HE GETS NERVOUS,

16:54.013 --> 16:56.616
HE JUST NEEDS A KICK
TO GET GOING.

16:56.616 --> 17:01.421
AAAHHH!
YOU'RE A MEANIE!

17:01.421 --> 17:05.095
STAY ON ME. STAY ON ME.

17:05.095 --> 17:07.497
MR. DAVENPORT BEGAN
HIS CAREER

17:07.497 --> 17:10.099
BY TINKERING
IN A SMALL GARAGE--

17:14.032 --> 17:15.204
SHE SAID "TINKER"!

17:16.665 --> 17:19.138
OKAY, UM...
SWITCHING GEARS,

17:19.138 --> 17:21.040
WHY DON'T YOU SHOW US

17:21.040 --> 17:23.512
EARLIER TECHNOLOGICAL
CREATIONS?

17:23.512 --> 17:25.615
OH! CAN I KEEP THIS?

17:27.046 --> 17:28.818
OH!

17:28.818 --> 17:31.050
I'M SORRY. I'LL PAY
TO HAVE THAT FIXED

17:31.050 --> 17:32.652
AS SOON AS
THE TOOTH FAIRY COMES,

17:32.652 --> 17:36.055
'CAUSE I'M ABOUT TO LOSE
A WHOLE TOOTH.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.228
OH, YOU'RE ABOUT
TO LOSE SEVERAL!

17:39.589 --> 17:41.331
O-KAY. I'M CALLING
THE PRESIDENT.

17:41.331 --> 17:43.062
HE MAY WANT TO
WITHDRAW THE AWARD.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.097
WE'VE GOTTA STOP THIS.

17:47.097 --> 17:49.599
ADAM, GO BEHIND THE CAMERA
AND TAKE IT OUT WITH
YOUR HEAT VISION.

17:49.599 --> 17:54.174
NO WAY! BABY DAVENPORT

17:54.174 --> 17:59.309
I AM THE EVIL CYBORG
MEGATRACTOID!

18:07.086 --> 18:08.288

18:08.288 --> 18:09.719
CUT TO COMMERCIAL.

18:09.719 --> 18:11.591
GO GET ANOTHER CAMERA
OUT OF THE VAN!

18:12.762 --> 18:14.424
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!

18:14.424 --> 18:16.296
NO ONE RAISES THEIR VOICE
TO MEGATRACTOID!

18:16.296 --> 18:17.497
( imitates laser blasts )

18:17.497 --> 18:20.800
OH, I'M ABOUT
TO PUT MEGATRACTOID DOWN!

18:20.800 --> 18:22.432
HEY, HEY, HEY!

18:22.432 --> 18:24.534
MOM, KEEP IT TOGETHER,
KEEP IT TOGETHER.

18:24.534 --> 18:27.877
ANCHOR LADY FACE,
ANCHOR LADY FACE.

18:27.877 --> 18:29.279
WE'RE GONNA TAKE
A HARD FIVE.

18:29.279 --> 18:31.110
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.682
OKAY.

18:38.418 --> 18:39.889
( gasps )

18:39.889 --> 18:42.121
AM I IN A SPACESHIP?

18:42.121 --> 18:44.424
ARE THOSE
SPACE BATHROOMS?

18:46.226 --> 18:47.827
SOMETIMES.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.759
HEY!

18:49.759 --> 18:52.632
HEY, THOSE ARE MINE!
PUT THOSE DOWN!

18:52.632 --> 18:54.634
WHAT IS GOING ON?

18:54.634 --> 18:56.806
I WANT ANSWERS,
AND DO NOT LIE TO ME.

18:56.806 --> 18:58.368
I'LL KNOW. LEO!

18:58.368 --> 19:00.910
SHE'LL KNOW!

19:00.910 --> 19:04.414
OKAY. THE NEURAL SCRAMBLER
ERASED 33 YEARS

19:04.414 --> 19:05.875
OF MR. DAVENPORT'S MEMORY.

19:05.875 --> 19:09.279
HOWEVER, I THINK
I CAN GET IT ALL BACK.

19:09.279 --> 19:10.650
YOU THINK?

19:10.650 --> 19:12.822
THAT WHITE HOUSE REP
IS WALKING OUT OF HERE

19:12.822 --> 19:14.784
WITH THAT MEDAL IF WE
DON'T GET IT TOGETHER--

19:14.784 --> 19:17.857
NOT TO MENTION I AM
BLOWING THE BIGGEST
INTERVIEW OF MY CAREER!

19:17.857 --> 19:19.789
FIX DONALD!

19:19.789 --> 19:20.790
LEO!

19:20.790 --> 19:22.792
FIX DONALD!

19:24.634 --> 19:25.895
I GOT IT.

19:25.895 --> 19:27.897
I REVERSE THE
NEURAL SCRAMBLER
BY TAKING IT APART

19:27.897 --> 19:29.569
AND REPURPOSING IT,

19:29.569 --> 19:31.801
JUST THE SAME WAY
THAT MR. DAVENPORT
DID WITH HIS INVENTIONS.

19:31.801 --> 19:34.344
WHICH MEANS YOU'LL ALL
GET TO SIT DOWN TONIGHT,

19:34.344 --> 19:35.945
'CAUSE I JUST
SAVED YOUR BUTTS!

19:37.577 --> 19:38.878
JUST DO IT!

19:38.878 --> 19:41.681
ECHO!
ECHO, ECHO, ECHO!

19:41.681 --> 19:43.653
THIS IS MY NEW FORT!
 Leo: WE GOT HIM!

19:47.287 --> 19:48.918
THAT'S WEIRD. JUST LOST
MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT.

19:51.321 --> 19:52.562
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

19:52.562 --> 19:55.295
OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW
THAT YOU NUMSKULLS

19:55.295 --> 19:58.828
HAVE "LEO'ED" UP MY LAB!

19:58.828 --> 20:01.301
OKAY, THAT STOPS NOW!

20:02.572 --> 20:04.834
HEY, WE DIDN'T MAKE
ANY OF THIS MESS.

20:04.834 --> 20:05.905
IT WAS ALL YOU.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.777
TECHNICALLY,
IT WAS BABY DAVENPORT.

20:07.777 --> 20:10.780
WELL, TECHNICALLY,
IT WAS TEEN DAVENPORT.

20:10.780 --> 20:13.983
( stammers )
 BABY?! TEEN?!

20:13.983 --> 20:16.846
HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN
MESSING WITH MY
NEURAL SCRAMBLER?

20:18.388 --> 20:20.690
YES. YES, WE HAVE.

20:20.690 --> 20:22.692
BUT, UH, IN THE END,
BIG "D,"

20:22.692 --> 20:26.326
I THINK WE LEARNED A VERY,
VERY VALUABLE LESSON.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.827
YOU WERE RIGHT.

20:27.827 --> 20:30.730
IT IS NOT EASY
RAISING TEENAGERS.

20:34.304 --> 20:35.565
ARE WE GOOD?

20:35.565 --> 20:37.867
NO!

20:37.867 --> 20:41.240
YOU ARE GROUNDED FOREVER!

20:42.312 --> 20:43.613
I GOT THIS!

20:43.613 --> 20:46.346
MR. DAVENPORT,
WOULD YOU SAY YOU GOT ANGRY

20:46.346 --> 20:47.947
ABOUT 30 SECONDS AGO?

20:47.947 --> 20:49.849
OH, GIVE ME THAT!

20:58.758 --> 21:01.731
WELL, IT WAS
VERY NICE MEETING YOU.

21:01.731 --> 21:05.565
YES. AND I...
MET YOU, TOO.

21:08.438 --> 21:09.939
WELL, I GOT MY MEDAL.

21:09.939 --> 21:12.902
YOU GOT YOUR INTERVIEW.
I THINK IT ALL WORKED OUT.

21:12.902 --> 21:15.345
IT ALL WORKED OUT?

21:15.345 --> 21:17.647
MY ENTIRE CAREER
WAS ON THE LINE!

21:17.647 --> 21:18.948
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

21:18.948 --> 21:22.512
I WAS ON LIVE TV INTERVIEWING
A 4-YEAR-OLD MAN-CHILD!

21:22.512 --> 21:24.784
AND IF YOU EVER JEOPARDIZE
MY CAREER AGAIN--

21:24.784 --> 21:26.586
( gasps )

21:26.586 --> 21:28.658
WOW, I FORGOT
WHAT I WAS SAYING.

21:28.658 --> 21:30.990
I BETTER GO GET READY
FOR MY INTERVIEW!

21:33.763 --> 21:36.866
IT IS SO MUCH MORE FUN
ON THIS SIDE OF IT!
