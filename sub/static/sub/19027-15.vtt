00:03.536 --> 00:07.802
<i>[J.D.] Now that Elliot and Keith were</i>
<i>serious, she started buying him gifts.</i>

00:07.874 --> 00:09.136
[Laughs]

00:09.209 --> 00:11.871
It's a mouth harp! Oh, awesome!

00:11.945 --> 00:15.904
<i>[J.D.] Keith was shockingly good</i>
<i>at pretending to like crappy presents.</i>

00:15.982 --> 00:17.609
<i>But you know what he was best at?</i>

00:17.684 --> 00:20.152
Keith, we need more popcorn, yeah.

00:20.220 --> 00:22.484
<i>[J.D.] Being girl bait.</i>

00:23.123 --> 00:24.590
<i>Here's how it goes down.</i>

00:24.657 --> 00:29.993
<i>Keith comes back, Elliot marks her</i>
<i>territory so the girls know he's taken,</i>

00:30.063 --> 00:33.362
<i>and I pick off one of the smaller ones</i>
<i>that comes by for a look-see.</i>

00:33.433 --> 00:35.333
I'm a doctor.

00:35.402 --> 00:37.029
I'm a landowner.

00:37.103 --> 00:39.128
Burt Reynolds is my father.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.172
I love sports.

00:41.641 --> 00:44.269
Keith, more popcorn.

00:48.782 --> 00:50.079
[Spring boings]

00:50.717 --> 00:52.412
See, that's how it works.

00:52.485 --> 00:54.510
You have the cutest hair.

00:54.587 --> 00:57.021
These old rags?

00:59.192 --> 01:02.958
OK, OK. So you're both... fertile,

01:03.029 --> 01:07.796
yet you're still unable to conceive,
so... How often do you make love?

01:07.867 --> 01:10.961
- Twice today.
- Actually, it was three times.

01:11.037 --> 01:13.665
You were asleep for the last one.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.708
- Wow. That really happened?
- Mm-hm.

01:15.809 --> 01:18.573
It was weird that you
were in one of my sex dreams.

01:18.645 --> 01:21.614
He is not allowed to dream about me.
It gets too freaky.

01:21.714 --> 01:24.478
Cirque du Soleil freaky.

01:24.584 --> 01:27.018
One time, she was skinless.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.920
OK. Stress is often
a factor in conception.

01:29.989 --> 01:34.153
So tell me, do you think
stress might be an issue?

01:36.096 --> 01:38.530
I swear,
if you don't knock me up tonight,

01:38.598 --> 01:42.967
there's no more sex until you steal
me a baby. So do it right this time.

01:45.405 --> 01:47.236
There's a little stress.

01:47.307 --> 01:50.071
OK, the antibiotics
have brought your fever down.

01:50.176 --> 01:51.939
Is there anything else I can do?

01:52.011 --> 01:56.175
Yeah, I'm auditioning for
my church's senior citizen production

01:56.249 --> 02:00.618
of <i>Streetcar Named Desire.</i>
Would you mind running lines with me?

02:00.687 --> 02:02.621
I'd be happy to.

02:02.689 --> 02:08.252
"If I didn't know you was my
wife's sister, I'd get ideas about you."

02:08.328 --> 02:14.198
I can't believe you think
I'd do this with you. Are you insane?

02:14.267 --> 02:16.235
Seriously, I'm a doctor.

02:16.336 --> 02:17.701
What page are you on?

02:17.770 --> 02:19.328
Oh...

02:20.607 --> 02:23.167
Why didn't you just read lines
with the old guy?

02:23.243 --> 02:25.404
My job is to make sick people better,

02:25.512 --> 02:29.881
not to help Bernie score a slice
of Episcopalian tail on opening night.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.816
Sometimes, you got
to go the extra mile with patients.

02:32.886 --> 02:35.377
That's what makes me
such a special doctor.

02:35.455 --> 02:39.186
That and your amazing ability
to switch back and forth seamlessly

02:39.259 --> 02:41.124
between male and female genitalia.

02:41.194 --> 02:43.128
Ooh...

02:43.596 --> 02:46.963
Newbie, snap out of it.
We don't have time for your daydreaming.

02:47.033 --> 02:50.400
I believe medicine
is about more than treating the disease.

02:50.470 --> 02:53.030
You've got to be there for people.
Take Mrs. Cohen.

02:53.106 --> 02:55.267
When she broke her hip, I treated that.

02:55.341 --> 02:57.241
She also left her car double-parked,

02:57.310 --> 03:01.212
so being an "extra mile" kind of guy,
I went and took care of it.

03:06.452 --> 03:09.683
Sorry. It's been a little while
since I drove stick.

03:11.858 --> 03:16.318
Wonder how she got out of that truck?
That's how she broke her hip.

03:17.697 --> 03:21.064
# <i>I can't do this all on my own</i>

03:21.167 --> 03:24.500
# <i>No, I know</i>
<i>I'm no Superman</i>

03:27.774 --> 03:29.708
# <i>I'm no Superman</i> #

03:31.411 --> 03:34.847
All I'm saying is it's important
to go the extra mile with patients.

03:34.914 --> 03:36.973
It's like I was telling this girl.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.608
- Why tell her?
- I didn't.

03:38.685 --> 03:40.846
I wanted to show you
who I'm going out with.

03:40.920 --> 03:45.220
Look, Newbie, there's a reason that I
can't go the extra mile with patients.

03:45.291 --> 03:48.454
- It's something personal.
- You can confide in me.

03:48.561 --> 03:52.463
I'm a good doctor. Kelly Ripa!

03:53.600 --> 03:56.501
<i>[J.D.] It didn't bother me</i>
<i>Dr. Cox had "Kelly Ripa'd" me,</i>

03:56.569 --> 04:01.029
<i>because I knew it would never catch on,</i>
<i>no matter how much he wanted it to.</i>

04:01.107 --> 04:03.473
<i>This, however, did upset me.</i>

04:03.543 --> 04:07.445
Uh, Carol, we got the
bone marrow biopsy back and, uh...

04:09.015 --> 04:10.778
...I'm afraid you have leukemia.

04:10.850 --> 04:12.545
What?

04:14.020 --> 04:16.511
Yes. But the good news
is it's very treatable.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.488
We have to get started right away.

04:21.226 --> 04:24.196
In four and a half years,
I've watched your pal, Stephanie,

04:24.297 --> 04:26.458
go through a multitude
of irritating fads:

04:26.566 --> 04:29.330
UGG boots, campaign
for better grammar among staff

04:29.402 --> 04:31.563
and the double European air-kiss.

04:31.638 --> 04:33.606
Seeing as you are sorority sisters,

04:33.673 --> 04:38.372
I was hoping you'd be able to tell me
when this "extra mile" crap will end.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.605
Oh, it's never gonna end.
He's relentless.

04:40.713 --> 04:43.876
Why do you think I was out Sunday
buying comics for my patient?

04:43.983 --> 04:49.944
They're giving away free Tastykakes
at the comic book store? Ha-ha!

04:50.023 --> 04:52.253
That worked better
when you were a fat load.

04:52.325 --> 04:53.758
- I know.
- Damn it!

04:55.995 --> 05:00.056
All right, Jake, here it is,
the latest <i>Vengeance.</i>

05:00.133 --> 05:02.294
I had to travel to five stores
to find that.

05:02.402 --> 05:04.302
This is last month's.

05:04.370 --> 05:06.338
I'll track down the new one for you,

05:06.439 --> 05:09.374
but right now, I got to make
sure I have a job next year, OK?

05:09.442 --> 05:13.208
<i>[J.D.] Since there were only three</i>
<i>attending spots for ten residents,</i>

05:13.279 --> 05:17.409
<i>Dr. Kelso could basically treat them</i>
<i>like his own personal valets.</i>

05:41.407 --> 05:45.173
All-day sucker, my ass. Try 20 minutes.

05:45.244 --> 05:46.541
Sir, quick question.

05:46.612 --> 05:49.706
[Gulping] Make it very quick.
I'm about to vomit.

05:49.782 --> 05:53.218
Why was I told to drop everything
and look after some new patient?

05:53.286 --> 05:56.551
Mr. Sommer is the cousin
of one of the trustees.

05:56.622 --> 05:59.182
Not important enough
to warrant face time with me,

05:59.292 --> 06:02.557
but connected enough that
if one of these ding-dongs kills him,

06:02.628 --> 06:05.392
- it'll be my ass.
- Carla, can you cover my patients?

06:05.465 --> 06:08.229
- She's watching someone for me.
- I'll find somebody.

06:08.334 --> 06:11.303
Because I'm just a nurse,
I can't look after everybody?

06:11.404 --> 06:13.770
- Precisely.
- J.D., why don't you tell me

06:13.840 --> 06:17.276
what's wrong with Mrs. Jones?
Without looking at a chart.

06:17.343 --> 06:21.643
<i>[J.D.] Carla knew, without charts,</i>
<i>doctors didn't know much about patients.</i>

06:22.348 --> 06:26.648
Mr. Barry, I misplaced your chart.
I forgot, what's wrong with you again?

06:28.821 --> 06:32.348
Oh, that's right. You have
a kitty cat stuck in your mouth.

06:32.425 --> 06:36.361
Or should I say you have
a person stuck around you, little guy?

06:36.429 --> 06:38.260
Cootchie-cootchie.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.492
It's not like nurses know everything.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.967
<i>[J.D.] Uh-oh. Carla's gearing up</i>
<i>to explode. Save yourself.</i>

06:44.036 --> 06:46.561
<i>Attempt the casual side-switch.</i>

06:46.639 --> 06:49.130
<i>And you're there. Now angry at Kelso.</i>

06:49.208 --> 06:51.642
- Bob, how dare you?
- Exactly.

06:51.711 --> 06:53.804
You're worried
about what I can handle?

06:53.880 --> 06:56.576
Vascular Surgery wants
an update every two hours,

06:56.649 --> 06:59.618
I'm weaning Mrs. Jones' dopamine
from ten mikes to five,

06:59.719 --> 07:01.880
Meyerson's abdominal wound is dehiscing

07:01.988 --> 07:05.515
and Mr. Wilder is turfed to Psych.
He thinks he's Flo from <i>Alice.</i>

07:05.591 --> 07:07.525
Kiss my grits!

07:07.593 --> 07:10.289
Exactly, Flo! Exactly!

07:11.030 --> 07:13.328
I hope you learned something today.

07:16.035 --> 07:19.493
Get a load of
Mr. Extra Mile Guy's leukemia patient,

07:19.572 --> 07:21.540
sitting in there all by herself.

07:21.607 --> 07:26.544
He's probably out getting a cake shaped
like a cancerous white blood cell.

07:26.612 --> 07:29.672
All right, team, let's stay close.
Come on.

07:29.749 --> 07:34.311
Carol! Look who I found.

07:34.387 --> 07:37.288
Larry? Dad? How?

07:37.356 --> 07:39.722
Well, right after
I got your test results back,

07:39.826 --> 07:43.592
I got on the horn with your dad and we
started a phone tree to find everyone.

07:43.696 --> 07:47.188
There were some tears,
mostly mine, but we got it done.

07:47.266 --> 07:49.734
You are the most amazing doctor.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.770
Hear that, Perry?

07:51.838 --> 07:57.299
I'm the most amazing doctor
because I went the extra 5,280 feet.

07:57.376 --> 08:00.470
What's that? That's right, it's a mile.

08:00.546 --> 08:02.844
And how does that makes me feel? Keith!

08:02.915 --> 08:04.280
[Mouth harp boings]

08:04.350 --> 08:06.011
Thank you.

08:08.955 --> 08:13.449
Attention, surgical residents
still hoping to have a job next year.

08:13.526 --> 08:16.154
The annual blood drive is upon us

08:16.229 --> 08:20.131
and I will be needing
a volunteer to greet our donors

08:20.199 --> 08:22.667
as the hospital's new mascot,

08:22.735 --> 08:26.398
the friendly hypodermic needle,
Mr. Prick.

08:27.673 --> 08:30.506
We'll probably change the name.

08:32.111 --> 08:36.980
I'm so sick of this. If the jobs were
given to whoever is the best surgeon,

08:37.049 --> 08:39.313
I would get all three
of those damn spots.

08:39.385 --> 08:41.909
It's the same on medical.
The only reason I got

08:41.988 --> 08:44.889
that oncology rotation
is I let Dr. Morgan take me

08:44.957 --> 08:47.425
- to his brother's wedding.
- Ricky Morgan?

08:48.294 --> 08:50.524
- He works in the cafeteria.
- What?!

08:50.596 --> 08:53.463
- What.
- Listen, kissing ass

08:53.533 --> 08:57.469
is just the way it's done around here,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

08:57.537 --> 09:01.997
We have to all band together and
agree not to be exploited by Dr. Kelso.

09:02.074 --> 09:06.636
From now on, we will only be judged by
our skill and abilities. Who's with me?

09:06.712 --> 09:08.407
That's right! That's right!

09:08.481 --> 09:11.211
From here on out,
no more getting him coffee,

09:11.284 --> 09:13.013
no more washing his car,

09:13.085 --> 09:18.113
no more taking his son
to the local steam baths to meet men.

09:18.190 --> 09:20.488
Well, hey, you guys got him coffee.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.892
"Together" on three. One, two, three.

09:22.962 --> 09:24.862
- Together!
- Let's go!

09:26.032 --> 09:27.124
What are you doing?

09:27.199 --> 09:29.759
Chief of medicine said
to pay special attention,

09:29.869 --> 09:32.702
and I take a couple of seconds
to get to know my patients.

09:32.772 --> 09:35.263
So, first question,
are you allergic to any...?

09:35.341 --> 09:37.002
[Janitor] Psst!

09:37.076 --> 09:39.237
- What?
- I need some advice.

09:41.280 --> 09:44.511
- Which do you prefer?
- What's the occasion?

09:44.584 --> 09:46.051
Me wiping up gunk.

09:47.119 --> 09:50.247
I was cleaning Kelso's tie rack
and I assumed I could have it.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.291
The Armani is very affective on urine,

09:52.358 --> 09:55.521
- whereas the Yves Saint Laurent is...
- No, no.

09:55.628 --> 09:57.687
What? Where'd he go?

09:59.432 --> 10:02.196
<i>[J.D.] Carol's family welcomed me</i>
<i>as one of their own.</i>

10:02.268 --> 10:04.031
<i>No more than her brother, Larry.</i>

10:04.103 --> 10:07.038
- Eagle!
- I told you not to call me Lawrence.

10:07.106 --> 10:09.802
And I told you I never get dizzy.

10:11.143 --> 10:14.203
OK. Let me tell you guys
why we are here.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.181
Carol is starting a journey, OK?

10:17.249 --> 10:21.185
Obviously, the chemo is gonna be
tough, but we're all here for you.

10:21.253 --> 10:24.416
Anything you go through,
we go through together.

10:26.826 --> 10:30.193
So you've all banded together.

10:30.262 --> 10:34.221
I honestly never thought I'd see the day
when we would pick the three surgeons

10:34.300 --> 10:39.260
who would care for people of this
great hospital based solely on merit.

10:39.372 --> 10:41.397
I hope you're proud of yourselves.

10:42.408 --> 10:46.344
This is a preliminary ranking
of your technical skills.

10:46.412 --> 10:49.540
So whenever you get a chance...

10:50.149 --> 10:52.709
<i>[J.D.] Life in a hospital</i>
<i>is constantly humbling.</i>

10:52.818 --> 10:56.481
<i>Whether it's making you realize</i>
<i>you're not as skilled as you thought...</i>

10:59.158 --> 11:01.820
Fourth?! I'm fourth?

11:01.894 --> 11:03.862
<i>... or as on the ball as you thought.</i>

11:03.963 --> 11:07.091
- How's Mr. Sommer doing?
- Actually, sir...

11:07.166 --> 11:09.726
He's perfectly fine, sir.
He's in tiptop shape.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.496
Good.

11:11.570 --> 11:14.334
Ow! What, are you wearing, a cup?

11:14.407 --> 11:16.967
People try to hit me there
more than you'd think.

11:19.111 --> 11:20.578
[Tapping]

11:22.048 --> 11:23.913
<i>[J.D.] The key is to be ready for it.</i>

11:23.983 --> 11:25.644
I was not ready for this.

11:25.718 --> 11:27.583
Since Carol is gonna lose her hair,

11:27.653 --> 11:31.783
we decided we'd all shave our heads now.
He even agreed to do the cutting.

11:32.391 --> 11:33.824
You're up next, big guy.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.155
I mean, come on.
You're all in this together, right?

11:37.229 --> 11:39.595
[Whirring]

11:43.235 --> 11:46.602
I can't believe
you all shaved your heads.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.936
How great. Even Nana.

11:49.008 --> 11:52.136
And you don't look creepy
or alien-like at all.

11:52.211 --> 11:54.577
Are you ready to run the extra mile?

11:54.647 --> 11:57.411
<i>[J.D.] You can't let him know</i>
<i>you don't want to do this.</i>

11:57.516 --> 12:00.485
<i>Meet his gaze. Meet it twice as hard!</i>

12:00.553 --> 12:02.180
Dr. Dorian, we need you.

12:02.254 --> 12:04.484
Mr. Bentley's condition
is getting worse.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.582
<i>[J.D.] God bless his herpes.</i>

12:06.659 --> 12:09.355
I'm gonna go take care of that man.
When I come back...

12:09.428 --> 12:12.659
<i>[J.D.] Pause for effect.</i>
<i>Pause for effect.</i>

12:12.732 --> 12:15.599
...we're gonna shave this thing.
- Yeah!

12:15.668 --> 12:18.432
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

12:19.305 --> 12:21.466
How the hell could I be fourth?!

12:21.574 --> 12:24.304
I know Bonnie's good
and Figsack has mad hands,

12:24.376 --> 12:27.937
but somehow, I keep forgetting
that Todd is a skilled surgeon.

12:28.013 --> 12:30.573
How come you didn't page me
about that consult?

12:30.649 --> 12:33.618
I did. You're wearing
your garage door opener on your hip.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.548
Ladies and gentlemen, number two.

12:40.059 --> 12:43.756
Kelso's gonna kill me.
I can't find Mr. Sommer.

12:43.829 --> 12:46.593
Did you look
between Mr. Spring and Mr. Fall?

12:46.665 --> 12:48.428
- Too easy.
- Hey, you know...?

12:48.534 --> 12:49.660
- More armor?
- No.

12:49.735 --> 12:55.435
Actually, I am sneaking trays out
of the cafeteria. I'm building a shed.

12:55.508 --> 12:58.602
This is partially your fault,
so you're gonna help me.

12:58.677 --> 13:02.977
You know, whenever I lose something
in the morgue, I just retrace my steps.

13:03.048 --> 13:05.016
Right now,
I'm looking for something,

13:05.084 --> 13:07.211
and I know I came
to the vending machine,

13:07.286 --> 13:10.449
then I dropped a quarter,
which rolled over here,

13:10.556 --> 13:13.218
and, yep, there you are.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.920
As soon as you take your eyes off 'em,
you lose 'em.

13:15.995 --> 13:19.294
They're like children.
Big dead children.

13:23.602 --> 13:27.094
I treated that girl at the free clinic.
She was born without nipples.

13:27.173 --> 13:30.108
I knew there had to be something wrong!
She's too perfect.

13:30.176 --> 13:34.704
I was kidding, J.D. I have never
seen her in my life. Kelly Ripa!

13:36.816 --> 13:39.717
- I told you it would catch on.
- I don't think it's funny.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.979
How's that leukemia patient doing?

13:43.055 --> 13:45.216
I'm hiding.
I really don't want to be bald.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.259
I have a suspicion
it won't work for me.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.294
It might accentuate my spoon-chest.

13:49.361 --> 13:51.329
- Yeah.
- Plus, the girl I'm dating

13:51.397 --> 13:53.456
is totally into my hair.

13:53.532 --> 13:56.501
She's got to be interested
in more than just your hair.

13:56.569 --> 14:00.733
If it weren't for your hair, I don't
think I'd be remotely interested in you.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.502
I'm sure there's
something else she's into.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.942
No, there's nothing else.

14:06.011 --> 14:08.980
There is. Even if she won't admit it.

14:09.048 --> 14:11.744
You know what, I'm stuck.
I have to shave this down.

14:11.817 --> 14:15.947
You don't have to go the extra mile.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.854
What happened to the days
when you used to listen to me?

14:18.924 --> 14:21.484
That was a long time ago.
You should listen to me.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.687
Not in this lifetime.

14:23.762 --> 14:26.629
Listen, Newbie,

14:26.699 --> 14:30.430
you're not a completely, terribly,
horrible, incompetent doctor.

14:30.502 --> 14:33.596
While I would never let
any blood relatives be your patient,

14:33.672 --> 14:36.368
if it was someone that I knew,
an acquaintance,

14:36.442 --> 14:38.933
I might be OK with you treating them.

14:39.011 --> 14:40.740
Thank you.

14:40.813 --> 14:44.271
The only thing you owe Carol
is to treat her the best you can.

14:47.453 --> 14:49.353
Hey, where you been?

14:49.421 --> 14:53.084
Oh, Larry, man.
I don't think I can shave my head.

14:53.158 --> 14:54.591
What about Carol?

14:54.660 --> 14:58.187
She'll be OK. She has all you guys.

15:07.373 --> 15:09.204
- You look over there.
- Mm-hm.

15:11.176 --> 15:12.336
Excuse me, nurse.

15:14.046 --> 15:16.412
Hi! How 'bout a poke?

15:16.482 --> 15:20.043
I have a husband, OK?
And he's big and he's black and...

15:20.119 --> 15:24.419
Baby, baby, it's me! But I do love
that you go to that big and black stuff.

15:24.490 --> 15:27.220
I can't wait to bear
the fruit of your loins.

15:27.293 --> 15:28.658
Baby, wait!

15:28.761 --> 15:33.494
This is the only way I can suck up
to Kelso without the surgeons knowing.

15:33.565 --> 15:35.726
There you are.

15:35.834 --> 15:38.667
- You're not Mr. Sommer.
- No, I'm not.

15:38.737 --> 15:40.398
No harm done.

15:44.944 --> 15:48.471
What's up... with y'all?

15:53.152 --> 15:54.779
[Turk] Ahh!

15:57.089 --> 15:58.989
Hey, Dr. Turk. What happened to you?

15:59.058 --> 16:00.787
I found the latest issue

16:00.859 --> 16:03.623
at a comic book store
a mile and a half away. Here you go.

16:03.696 --> 16:09.032
Actually, I ran there in a
foam needle suit, but you don't care.

16:09.101 --> 16:10.068
Thanks, Dr. Turk.

16:13.038 --> 16:17.168
Christopher,
I heard you were sweating the rankings.

16:17.242 --> 16:20.871
No. I'm married
and trying to have a baby.

16:20.946 --> 16:23.847
Not having a job
would be a big boost for me.

16:23.916 --> 16:28.080
You're a good surgeon. Plus,
your bedside manner is really important.

16:28.187 --> 16:31.714
There's no one on that list who
spends more time with their patients.

16:31.790 --> 16:33.951
Are you saying I have a job?

16:35.361 --> 16:39.798
If you are trying to "Kelly Ripa" me
right now, I will freak out.

16:44.503 --> 16:45.993
I got a job!

16:48.941 --> 16:51.876
Well, the good news is,
his head isn't in the storage room.

16:51.944 --> 16:55.311
I once found a head. It's a funny story.
I put it in my locker.

16:55.381 --> 16:58.680
I didn't have time to get
to Lost and Found, forgot all about it.

16:58.751 --> 17:01.584
Come back to work on Monday,
open my locker, whoa! Head!

17:01.653 --> 17:04.315
Plus rats! I panicked.
I didn't know what to do.

17:04.390 --> 17:06.950
I grabbed the thing
and ran up to the roof, punt it,

17:07.026 --> 17:08.686
and I shank it wide-left.

17:08.761 --> 17:12.527
It's heading straight down, right
for Kelso sitting in his convertible.

17:12.598 --> 17:14.623
I'm done.
I'm out of a job, right? Wrong.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.828
At that second, a hawk flies in,

17:17.903 --> 17:19.871
grabs the thing and flies off with it.

17:19.972 --> 17:23.669
I know what you're thinking. We're
in a city. What's a hawk doing there?

17:24.242 --> 17:26.803
I can't believe you get a locker
and I don't.

17:26.878 --> 17:30.440
Dr. Reid, I need
to meet you in Radiology

17:30.549 --> 17:32.107
to go over some test results.

17:32.184 --> 17:34.618
Yeah, it's over, Ricky.

17:35.988 --> 17:38.923
I know you're stealing trays. Stop it.

17:38.991 --> 17:40.891
Buzz off.

17:40.959 --> 17:43.723
Carla, the orderly
lost my chart for Mr. Tyler in 406.

17:43.829 --> 17:45.387
Would we have his dosages?

17:45.464 --> 17:49.423
You put him on penicillin, but he was
allergic, so you put him on vancomycin.

17:49.501 --> 17:50.661
Thank you.

17:52.004 --> 17:55.735
Wish you put some of that crazy-nurse
memory to use on our missing dude.

17:57.176 --> 17:59.440
Well, he was an older guy

17:59.511 --> 18:03.880
and he was on an IV,
so he couldn't have gotten very far.

18:03.949 --> 18:09.012
He was jittery and he had this
weird circle tan line on his arm.

18:10.322 --> 18:13.780
It was the nicotine patch.
He was trying to quit smoking.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.420
Should I not be out here?

18:22.234 --> 18:24.896
There he is, Mr. Spot on His Lungs.

18:24.970 --> 18:27.234
Don't worry, we'll pop that lung out,

18:27.306 --> 18:30.537
get it to the dry cleaners
and have it back to you after five.

18:32.578 --> 18:34.102
We like to have fun.

18:35.581 --> 18:37.139
I made up that whole hawk story.

18:37.249 --> 18:41.117
Yeah. I know you're not as weird
as you want people to think you are.

18:41.186 --> 18:42.744
[Clangs]

18:42.855 --> 18:46.814
[# Tammany Hall NYC: <i>Someone</i> ]

18:55.300 --> 18:57.268
Whoa! Nana! How you doing?

18:57.336 --> 19:00.601
Looking hot in the tracksuit.
Gym's on the second floor.

19:02.207 --> 19:04.141

19:04.743 --> 19:06.802
Dude. There you are. Two things.

19:06.879 --> 19:09.347
First, aliens are here
wearing tracksuits.

19:09.414 --> 19:12.906
- Oh, no, that's Nana.
- Second... I got a job.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.646
- Nice.
- If you hadn't pushed me

19:14.720 --> 19:17.780
to do that extra mile stuff,
that wouldn't have happened,

19:17.856 --> 19:19.619
so thank you.

19:19.691 --> 19:23.183
You got a hottie waiting for you
at the bar. You go get her!

19:25.864 --> 19:28.424
- Where were we?
- Do I smell banana conditioner?

19:28.500 --> 19:31.560
That's one of my conditioners, yes.

19:33.438 --> 19:37.966
<i>[J.D.] As great as this was, I couldn't</i>

19:45.184 --> 19:47.015
Ah!

19:47.920 --> 19:50.480
How was your first stress-free day?

19:50.556 --> 19:52.888
Horrible. You?

19:52.958 --> 19:54.926
Worse.

19:54.993 --> 19:57.154
Let's make a baby.

19:57.262 --> 19:59.958
If it doesn't work this time,
I'll kill myself.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.425
Not helping with the stress.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.433
<i>[J.D.] I knew if I didn't</i>

20:20.118 --> 20:23.246

I wasn't expecting any."

- "I hope you like it."
- Aw...

- No, that's not it at all.

Get involved.
