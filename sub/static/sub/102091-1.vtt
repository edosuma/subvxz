M_I_SForEver

00:48.208 --> 00:52.290
On October 31, 1988,
10-year-old Robert Maxwell

00:52.292 --> 00:54.498
attended a classmates
Halloween party.

00:54.500 --> 00:56.748
Several of the children
there tormented Robert,

00:56.750 --> 00:58.206
giving him a panic attack.

00:58.208 --> 01:00.581
His nose began to
bleed uncontrollably.

01:00.583 --> 01:02.748
Confused and scared,
he ran out the house

01:02.750 --> 01:05.373
as children chased him deep
into the neighboring woods

01:05.375 --> 01:07.208
known as Diablo's Den.

01:08.750 --> 01:13.208
That night, eight children
returned but Robert did not.

01:14.583 --> 01:16.081
Through the following weeks,

01:16.083 --> 01:18.831
a Fall Creek Valley search
party scoured the woods,

01:18.833 --> 01:20.750
but he was never found.

01:22.417 --> 01:25.623
As the years passed,
many claimed to see the ghost of Robert

01:25.625 --> 01:28.290
wandering the streets
on Halloween night.

01:28.292 --> 01:29.915
Still wearing his costume

01:29.917 --> 01:33.165
leaving a crimson trail
from his bleeding nose.

01:33.167 --> 01:36.458
Thus began the urban
legend of Bloody Bobby.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.831
I just want this all to go away.

01:52.833 --> 01:53.667
I know.

01:55.333 --> 01:58.498
Maybe this could be
kind of therapeutic

01:58.500 --> 02:00.375
for you to talk
about all of this.

02:07.125 --> 02:09.705
You're not gonna
spin this around?

02:09.708 --> 02:11.583
No I won't, Alex.

02:12.542 --> 02:14.125
I'm a journalist too you know.

02:15.625 --> 02:16.583
I've seen it all

02:18.458 --> 02:20.123
and I know when I'm being duped.

02:20.125 --> 02:21.458
I'm not gonna dupe you.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.290
This...

02:24.292 --> 02:26.248
This is the biggest tragedy

02:26.250 --> 02:28.208
in the history of
Fall Creek Valley.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.667
It's not gonna go away.

02:32.917 --> 02:34.665
You know, maybe I could
write my own story huh?

02:34.667 --> 02:38.081
That way it wouldn't
have all the lies

02:38.083 --> 02:39.623
that other people
would put into it.

02:39.625 --> 02:42.458
Yeah I don't think you could
be very objective about it.

02:44.167 --> 02:45.500
It doesn't matter anyway.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.373
People are gonna take away
from this whatever they want.

02:49.375 --> 02:50.623
I could say whatever
I want to say

02:50.625 --> 02:52.458
and you could write
whatever you want.

02:54.625 --> 02:55.873
It's not gonna stop
it from becoming

02:55.875 --> 02:57.333
some twisted urban legend.

02:58.792 --> 03:01.417
Parents are gonna find their
kids in the dark chanting.

03:04.625 --> 03:07.042
As if they're trying
to channel his spirit.

03:08.333 --> 03:09.708
Bring him back to life.

03:11.125 --> 03:12.915
They're gonna hear
their kids whispering,

03:12.917 --> 03:15.206
Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby!

03:15.208 --> 03:17.623
Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby!

03:17.625 --> 03:19.873
Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby!

03:19.875 --> 03:22.040
Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby!

03:22.042 --> 03:24.373
Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby!

03:24.375 --> 03:26.873
Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby!

03:26.875 --> 03:28.415
Ooh!

03:28.417 --> 03:32.540
That was like shaving my fuzzy
man-purse with a switchblade!

03:32.542 --> 03:34.040
Hardcore!

03:34.042 --> 03:36.248
My body is shakin'
and my head is quakin'

03:36.250 --> 03:40.498
after that skull-pounding
number from Jetset Rejects.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.165
If you can't get
enough from that band,

03:42.167 --> 03:44.206
you can catch them
tomorrow night

03:44.208 --> 03:47.790
at our Annual
Hallow-Scream Creepshow.

03:47.792 --> 03:50.748
Rumor has it that
lead singer Mike Scott

03:50.750 --> 03:53.581
will be judging the
costume contest.

03:53.583 --> 03:57.081
First prize for Best Male
Costume is 5,000 big ones.

03:57.083 --> 03:58.540
First prize for the ladies

03:58.542 --> 04:01.833
is a night alone with
Mike Scott himself.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.581
Now we've been
dropping clues all week

04:04.583 --> 04:07.290
for the secret location
of this annual rock fest.

04:07.292 --> 04:11.040
Last clue for you comes
tomorrow at two o'clock sharp.

04:11.042 --> 04:14.831
Your last chance for this
devlishly-rockin good time

04:14.833 --> 04:16.956
brought to you by 101.6.

04:16.958 --> 04:18.748
Okay, listen, I know we've
been to Hallow-Scream

04:18.750 --> 04:20.331
for the past last like 20 years

04:20.333 --> 04:24.540
but I am so giddy I want to
pee in my pants!

04:24.542 --> 04:27.456
No seriously we are gonna
have the best costumes.

04:27.458 --> 04:30.373
They are gonna kick so much ass!

04:30.375 --> 04:32.290
Costumes?

04:32.292 --> 04:33.206
What costumes?

04:33.208 --> 04:35.498
I wanted to surprise you.

04:35.500 --> 04:37.956
You're gonna be He-Man
and I am gonna be She-Ra!

04:37.958 --> 04:39.456
Uh!

04:39.458 --> 04:43.123
Oh great a shitty gay-ass
cartoon from the 80s!

04:43.125 --> 04:44.331
Cool!

04:44.333 --> 04:45.706
I can't believe
you just said that!

04:45.708 --> 04:47.292
She-ra was my idol!

04:50.417 --> 04:52.292
Aw man that show was propaganda.

04:54.917 --> 04:56.542
It was a gay
recruitment cartoon.

05:01.333 --> 05:02.165
Here we go.

05:02.167 --> 05:03.748
Aw don't give me that.

05:03.750 --> 05:06.042
Alright, look, gay guys
can't reproduce right?

05:09.167 --> 05:11.123
Alright, look, you got He-man.

05:11.125 --> 05:13.831
This buffed up hunk
protector of the universe.

05:13.833 --> 05:15.250
But what's his true identity?

05:16.250 --> 05:17.708
Prince Adam.

05:19.042 --> 05:22.790
Boring, pale-faced,
purple-wearing sissy bitch.

05:22.792 --> 05:24.998
Even his pet is a fucking pussy!

05:26.250 --> 05:27.498
I'm not saying that
because its a cat.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.581
Like it's all scared
and shit all the time.

05:29.583 --> 05:30.831
So then you got Prince Adam

05:30.833 --> 05:33.373
who wields his mighty
magic sword and bam!

05:33.375 --> 05:36.083
By the Honor of Grayskull!

05:37.208 --> 05:39.165
Aw fuck that for the
Honor of Grayskull shit.

05:39.167 --> 05:40.706
That was She-ra's thing.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.873
He-man said, "By the
power of Gray..."

05:42.875 --> 05:44.331
"By the Power of Grayskull."

05:44.333 --> 05:46.081
"I have the Power!"

05:46.083 --> 05:47.831
Oh, yeah, so you know
a lot about He-man

05:47.833 --> 05:49.958
for someone who doesn't
really like the show.

05:51.083 --> 05:54.167
So, anyway, after Prince
Adam gets the power,

05:55.042 --> 05:57.123
he transforms into He-man.

05:57.125 --> 05:58.790
Tan.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.873
Deep voice.

06:00.875 --> 06:02.290
Shirtless with furry pants on.

06:02.292 --> 06:03.498
Mm-hmm.

06:03.500 --> 06:04.581
He was the inspiration
for male strippers

06:04.583 --> 06:05.708
for the next 30 years!

06:07.125 --> 06:10.040
Oh so what you are saying is
you think He-man was sexy.

06:10.042 --> 06:12.040
No, I never said sexy.

06:12.042 --> 06:13.250
I said He-man was gay.

06:14.833 --> 06:15.625
Pay attention.

06:19.000 --> 06:19.915
Look at all the other characters

06:19.917 --> 06:21.540
from Masters of the Universe.

06:21.542 --> 06:22.831
Man-at-Arms.

06:22.833 --> 06:24.373
Gay.

06:24.375 --> 06:25.540
Merman.

06:25.542 --> 06:26.375
Gay.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.040
Beastman.

06:29.042 --> 06:29.873
Totally gay.

06:29.875 --> 06:31.706
I mean Fisto.

06:31.708 --> 06:32.542
Fisto?

06:33.500 --> 06:34.331
Supergay!

06:34.333 --> 06:36.373
One million percent gay!

06:36.375 --> 06:38.165
Alright then so all these
buffed-up homoerotic men

06:38.167 --> 06:42.081
spend all their time
fighting for Grayskull.

06:42.083 --> 06:44.665
And do you know what the
Castle of Grayskull truly was?

06:44.667 --> 06:46.248
An All Man's Clubhouse.

06:46.250 --> 06:47.583
No bitches allowed.

06:48.917 --> 06:50.083
Sorry, women.

06:51.583 --> 06:52.540
It's as simple as this.

06:52.542 --> 06:54.581
Gay guys cannot reproduce.

06:54.583 --> 06:56.248
So they have to recruit.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.248
So they make this
awesome cartoon filled

06:58.250 --> 07:02.248
with tons of gay overtones
to recruit future members

07:02.250 --> 07:04.667
to join the Gay Alliance
later on down the road.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.833
And I'm not being
homophobic either.

07:09.167 --> 07:10.956
Just simple science.

07:10.958 --> 07:14.417
Recruit or die off.

07:16.583 --> 07:17.831
Don't give me that shit.

07:17.833 --> 07:20.123
Yeah, I hardly think
it works like that.

07:20.125 --> 07:22.331
I actually think that's
the dumbest thing

07:22.333 --> 07:23.623
that's ever come
out of your mouth.

07:23.625 --> 07:25.998
And, believe me, I've
heard some dumb shit.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.373
Hey, you're going the wrong way.

07:27.375 --> 07:28.415
It's a shortcut.

07:28.417 --> 07:29.792
Over my dead body.

07:35.542 --> 07:36.375
What was that?

07:37.500 --> 07:38.333
It's nothing.

07:41.542 --> 07:42.956
You okay?

07:42.958 --> 07:43.792
Yeah.

07:44.667 --> 07:46.456
No, no, no stay in the car!

07:46.458 --> 07:47.290
Okay?

07:47.292 --> 07:48.125
I've gotta check it out.

07:49.292 --> 07:52.583
What?

07:54.292 --> 07:55.540
What, what?

07:55.542 --> 07:57.625
We hit a pumpkin!

08:00.583 --> 08:01.956
What the fuck?

08:06.208 --> 08:08.081
Some asshole left a pumpkin
in the middle of the road.

08:08.083 --> 08:09.248
Fuckin' up my rig!

08:13.208 --> 08:14.540
Ash, just get back
in the car, okay?

08:14.542 --> 08:15.498
Let's just go!

08:15.500 --> 08:16.706
I gotta check this shit out!

08:21.750 --> 08:22.956
This is bullshit!

08:22.958 --> 08:24.250
I'm calling a tow truck!

08:48.792 --> 08:49.708
Hello?

09:07.542 --> 09:08.373
Don't go too far.

09:08.375 --> 09:09.208
Take this.

09:10.042 --> 09:10.998
Thank you.

10:23.958 --> 10:25.208
Ash!

12:35.583 --> 12:37.081
What do we have?

12:37.083 --> 12:40.042
I'm not sure but I bet we'll
find more answers down there.

12:42.000 --> 12:42.956
Been down there yet?

12:42.958 --> 12:44.456
No, not yet.

12:44.458 --> 12:46.498
I wanted to get this scene
all squared away first.

12:46.500 --> 12:51.248
So the vehicle is
registered to Ash Simpson.

12:51.250 --> 12:52.790
There's a lot of
cash left in the car

12:52.792 --> 12:55.331
so we can rule out robbery.

12:55.333 --> 12:58.083
And based on this driver's
license that I found?

12:59.167 --> 13:01.958
That is Crystal Cochran.

13:02.708 --> 13:05.375
No signs of Ash Simpson.

13:23.625 --> 13:25.083
Did you find anything else?

13:27.792 --> 13:30.331
Another gutless corpse
in Diablo's Den!

15:14.417 --> 15:16.208
Reggie, it stinks in here!

15:20.917 --> 15:22.375
What happened to your face?

15:23.292 --> 15:25.583
What, I just woke up?

15:26.542 --> 15:27.623
Just get in the shower

15:27.625 --> 15:29.123
I can smell you from here.

15:36.833 --> 15:38.081
Gross!

15:38.083 --> 15:39.290
Gross!

15:39.292 --> 15:40.125
Gross!

15:41.292 --> 15:42.125
Blehh!

15:56.500 --> 15:57.873
Hey, Oswald!

15:57.875 --> 15:58.873
There she is!

15:58.875 --> 16:01.165
Where are you, in a hotel room?

16:01.167 --> 16:03.123
Oh, yeah, I'm in
my cousin's room.

16:03.125 --> 16:04.415
The bum just woke up.

16:04.417 --> 16:05.956
He's taking a shower right now.

16:05.958 --> 16:10.125
Oh, so what you're saying is
you have a few minutes alone?

16:10.625 --> 16:11.540
Oswald!

16:11.542 --> 16:13.040
I only have like two minutes!

16:13.042 --> 16:15.665
That's all I need,
baby!

16:15.667 --> 16:16.498
Aaahhh!

16:16.500 --> 16:17.331
Oswald!

16:17.333 --> 16:18.790
Your lunch is ready!

16:18.792 --> 16:19.665
Okay!

16:19.667 --> 16:21.000
In a minute, Ma!

16:22.000 --> 16:25.792
Sorry about that.

16:27.250 --> 16:29.831
So I can't finally wait to
see you tonight in person!

16:29.833 --> 16:31.165
This meeting?

16:31.167 --> 16:32.165
Long overdue!

16:32.167 --> 16:33.665
Mmm-hmm.

16:33.667 --> 16:36.373
My heart is beating faster
just thinking about it!

16:36.375 --> 16:38.123
Mine too, cowboy!

16:38.125 --> 16:39.581
Mine too!

16:39.583 --> 16:40.417
Nice!

16:41.875 --> 16:42.998
Uh, how do these smell?

16:43.000 --> 16:43.956
Ohh!

16:43.958 --> 16:45.748
Um!

16:45.750 --> 16:46.581
Eww!

16:46.583 --> 16:47.998
You know what?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.042
If you need a second
opinion the answer is no!

16:52.625 --> 16:53.456
Eww!

16:53.458 --> 16:54.292
Oh, God!

16:56.375 --> 16:58.373
Hey, did you see
that email from Alex?

16:58.375 --> 16:59.831
Uh, what?

16:59.833 --> 17:01.290
It looks like he finally
made it back into the States.

17:01.292 --> 17:03.040
He's gonna be here
tomorrow morning.

17:03.042 --> 17:04.291
It's about time.

17:05.833 --> 17:06.875
Are you decent yet?

17:08.625 --> 17:09.458
Yeah.

17:11.375 --> 17:12.790
You know you could've
stayed with me.

17:12.791 --> 17:15.041
I have a whole three
bedroom house to myself now.

17:17.250 --> 17:19.748
Um, aside from the fact that

17:19.750 --> 17:22.083
Grandma might be
haunting the place,

17:23.541 --> 17:25.998
I really don't want to
hear you having cybersex

17:26.000 --> 17:27.830
with your internet boyfriend.

17:27.833 --> 17:29.623
Oh my God, that only
happened like one time

17:29.625 --> 17:32.081
and it was purely by accident.

17:32.083 --> 17:33.915
How does cybersex
become accidental?

17:33.917 --> 17:38.206
Maybe I've accidentally had
cybersex and just don't know it.

17:38.208 --> 17:39.748
Anyway I'm gonna meet
up with him tonight

17:39.750 --> 17:41.206
for the first time ever.

17:41.208 --> 17:43.748
Yeah, we're going to
this big Halloween party.

17:43.750 --> 17:45.165
Hey, you should come!

17:45.167 --> 17:46.081
You know what?

17:46.083 --> 17:47.458
It's actually at your old house!

17:47.917 --> 17:49.165
Huh?

17:49.167 --> 17:49.956
Yeah Willy Anderson
bought your old house

17:49.958 --> 17:51.583
like six months ago!

17:55.125 --> 17:57.915
You said he was in
Wall Street, New York.

17:57.917 --> 17:59.165
Doing that Wall Street stuff.

17:59.167 --> 18:02.290
Yeah, I guess he
like tried to screw

18:02.292 --> 18:04.915
his boss's daughter or assistant
or something like that.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.748
So he totally got fired
for sexual harassment.

18:07.750 --> 18:10.581
So he's back in good ol'
Fall Creek Valley again

18:10.583 --> 18:11.748
for a fresh start!

18:11.750 --> 18:15.040
Hmm, I think I'd rather
have dull pencils

18:15.042 --> 18:16.956
just shoved directly
into my eyeballs

18:16.958 --> 18:19.415
then actually hang out
with Willy Anderson again.

18:19.417 --> 18:22.581
That kid used to kick my
ass everyday in school!

18:22.583 --> 18:23.581
Oh my God, Reggie.

18:23.583 --> 18:24.915
It's been like 20 years.

18:24.917 --> 18:25.792
Get over it!

18:28.375 --> 18:30.040
Hey, you know a
lot of our friends

18:30.042 --> 18:31.456
are gonna be there too.

18:31.458 --> 18:33.040
Like Erica?

18:33.042 --> 18:34.373
Your wallet is
right here, genius.

18:34.375 --> 18:35.208
Oh, thanks.

18:36.625 --> 18:39.248
Erica is actually getting
married to Jebediah Osborn.

18:39.250 --> 18:40.248
Is that the Preacher's Son?

18:40.250 --> 18:41.456
Mm-hmm.

18:41.458 --> 18:43.581
Totally turned her life around.

18:43.583 --> 18:44.956
Turned to God and
now she's marrying

18:44.958 --> 18:46.581
the Son of a Preacher Man!

18:46.583 --> 18:47.417
Wow.

18:48.625 --> 18:50.206
Oh and I believe Madison

18:50.208 --> 18:52.498
is also gonna be there tonight.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.333
Really?

18:54.792 --> 18:58.373
Well maybe I'm not really
doing anything tonight.

18:58.375 --> 18:59.206
Maybe I'll go with you.

18:59.208 --> 19:00.623
Yay, you're coming!

19:00.625 --> 19:01.456
You're coming!

19:01.458 --> 19:02.790
Yay, goodie!

19:02.792 --> 19:04.206
I'm so excited!

19:04.208 --> 19:08.248
You can meet my new
internet boyfriend, Oswald.

19:08.250 --> 19:10.706
Oswald Jeffrey Gacy.

19:10.708 --> 19:12.248
Hm!

19:12.250 --> 19:15.331
You realize that sounds like
a serial killer name, right?

19:15.333 --> 19:17.500
Why does everybody
keep saying that?

19:37.792 --> 19:39.708
You have to remember
to chew, Deputy.

19:41.958 --> 19:43.498
Sorry.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.498
My first meal of the day.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.623
We had a pretty early
call this morning.

19:47.625 --> 19:49.873
Are people getting
teepeed already?

19:49.875 --> 19:51.206
Not exactly.

19:51.208 --> 19:53.581
The Sheriff and I, we
were up at Diablo's...

19:53.583 --> 19:54.665
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:54.667 --> 19:56.542
We found some graffiti.

19:58.708 --> 19:59.542
Hmm.

20:03.375 --> 20:04.873
And that's it.

20:04.875 --> 20:08.206
Unless the bottomless pit
here wants something else.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.125
No, I'm good.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.542
Never ever say Diablo's
Den again, okay?

20:19.042 --> 20:19.875
Okay.

20:26.208 --> 20:28.042
It'll be 14.26.

20:35.250 --> 20:36.415
Thank you, Sheriff.

20:36.417 --> 20:37.250
Sure.

20:40.583 --> 20:42.623
Actually, Sheriff,
can I holler at you

20:42.625 --> 20:44.540
real quick for a second?

20:44.542 --> 20:46.540
Um, early this morning

20:46.542 --> 20:50.415
I saw some kid crawl over
my fence into my yard.

20:50.417 --> 20:53.956
And I'm pretty sure
it's Missy Waters' kid.

20:53.958 --> 20:57.248
Ya see, he wasn't
too keen about me

20:57.250 --> 21:00.083
uh bangin' his Mom a
couple months back.

21:01.500 --> 21:04.042
I mean, we had some really
good times together.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.165
You know but then she tried
to get all serious with me

21:07.167 --> 21:08.373
and everything.

21:08.375 --> 21:10.706
And actually between you and I,

21:10.708 --> 21:12.165
it would be a disservice

21:12.167 --> 21:15.623
to all the ladies in Fall
Creek Valley if I settle down.

21:16.708 --> 21:18.123
So I dropped her.

21:18.125 --> 21:20.206
And then she just
kept calling me up,

21:20.208 --> 21:21.915
you know, cryin' on the phone.

21:21.917 --> 21:23.373
"Can we work things out?"

21:23.375 --> 21:24.665
Then I hear her Son
back there sayin' shit.

21:24.667 --> 21:25.498
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

21:25.500 --> 21:26.498
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:26.500 --> 21:28.623
What happened this morning?

21:28.625 --> 21:32.248
Oh, oh um, shit, nothin'
out of the ordinary.

21:32.250 --> 21:34.873
I mean other than that
little punk tresspassin'!

21:34.875 --> 21:35.790
Alright.

21:35.792 --> 21:37.581
I'll keep an eye out.

21:37.583 --> 21:39.125
Thanks, Sheriff!

21:45.000 --> 21:47.415
You were saying you found
something down in the Den?

21:47.417 --> 21:48.623
No, you know what?

21:48.625 --> 21:51.248
I really can't say where we were

21:51.250 --> 21:54.373
because I still don't know
the area all that well.

21:54.375 --> 21:59.375
But I could use someone to
really show me around town.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.583
Hey, order up!

22:04.917 --> 22:06.208
Be right back.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.625
Mind if I join you, Deputy?

22:24.208 --> 22:25.456
Ahh.

22:28.792 --> 22:30.000
The Sheriff is right.

22:31.667 --> 22:33.706
This town gets a little anxious

22:33.708 --> 22:36.333
at the mention of Diablo's Den.

22:39.250 --> 22:40.542
Especially her.

22:41.875 --> 22:43.581
She's spent the last
20 some-odd years

22:43.583 --> 22:45.583
trying to forget
about that place.

22:46.458 --> 22:47.458
Excuse me?

22:49.625 --> 22:51.708
I know you and the
Sheriff found something

22:52.875 --> 22:55.040
down in Diablo's
Den this morning.

22:55.042 --> 22:56.123
I don't know what
you're talkin...

22:56.125 --> 22:57.875
Don't deny it, Son.

22:59.208 --> 23:00.958
It may be just a
little graffiti.

23:02.417 --> 23:06.290
But I know why the Sheriff
wants it kept a secret.

23:06.292 --> 23:09.040
And why is that Mister?

23:09.042 --> 23:10.623
Granger.

23:10.625 --> 23:11.875
Horace Granger.

23:13.208 --> 23:14.292
You'll get to know me.

23:15.542 --> 23:18.750
I own Granger's Pub
off of Harvest Way.

23:22.583 --> 23:23.748
It ain't graffiti
that the Sheriff

23:23.750 --> 23:25.250
wants to keep quiet about.

23:28.333 --> 23:29.458
It's the location.

23:33.792 --> 23:34.625
Ah!

23:36.875 --> 23:37.417
Doctor Nolan!

23:38.917 --> 23:40.998
Meet our new Deputy.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.498
Nice to meet you.

23:42.500 --> 23:43.706
Please join us.

23:43.708 --> 23:46.581
She's doing a story
on Diablo's Den.

23:46.583 --> 23:48.625
Do you mind if I
take some notes?

23:50.583 --> 23:51.498
Go ahead.

23:51.500 --> 23:52.748
Thank you.

23:52.750 --> 23:53.998
You see Diablo's Den
is older than the town

23:54.000 --> 23:56.250
of Fall Creek Valley.

23:58.625 --> 23:59.708
Some say it's haunted.

24:01.125 --> 24:04.708
Some believe it is
a gateway to Hell.

24:06.125 --> 24:09.833
Either way, everyone
steers clear of that place.

24:11.042 --> 24:11.875
Why?

24:14.958 --> 24:18.290
You didn't feel anything
while you were out there?

24:18.292 --> 24:19.958
Something unnatural?

24:21.625 --> 24:23.333
Something unexplained?

24:24.208 --> 24:27.250
Maybe even a little evil?

24:34.500 --> 24:36.331
You mentioned Madison.

24:36.333 --> 24:37.792
What does she want to forget?

24:40.500 --> 24:44.167
Some bad things happened
out there over the years.

24:45.333 --> 24:47.498
It started when she was a kid.

24:47.500 --> 24:50.748
A 10-year-old boy,
Bobby Maxwell,

24:50.750 --> 24:53.958
went missing on
Halloween night 1988.

24:55.667 --> 24:57.750
He went to a party
and never came home.

24:59.333 --> 25:01.498
The whole town was in a
frenzy looking for him

25:01.500 --> 25:06.167
but no trace of the
boy was ever found.

25:07.417 --> 25:09.831
What does that have to
do with Diablo's Den?

25:09.833 --> 25:10.583
Ah!

25:11.833 --> 25:15.290
About two months after
his disappearance,

25:15.292 --> 25:16.915
some kid came forward
with information

25:16.917 --> 25:18.917
about what happened that night.

25:20.167 --> 25:22.040
Said a group of
kids from the party

25:22.042 --> 25:24.917
taunted and chased
Bobby into the woods.

25:27.292 --> 25:30.708
Bobby fell down into the ravine
that overlooks the highway

25:31.917 --> 25:33.750
and was hit by a car.

25:35.375 --> 25:36.956
And they never found the body?

25:36.958 --> 25:37.792
No.

25:40.083 --> 25:43.500
Like I said, no trace
of him anywhere.

25:44.375 --> 25:45.790
Not in the woods.

25:45.792 --> 25:46.665
On the highway.

25:46.667 --> 25:47.500
Nowhere.

25:49.125 --> 25:53.706
The only thing that showed up
was a tattered old comic book

25:53.708 --> 25:57.542
with his name on it
found in Diablo's Den.

26:00.417 --> 26:05.375
Some think the evil in Diablo's
Den just swallowed him up.

26:09.417 --> 26:11.208
This Bobby.

26:12.292 --> 26:13.956
Is he one of Madison's friends?

26:13.958 --> 26:14.792
No.

26:15.625 --> 26:16.458
No.

26:17.792 --> 26:19.750
The kid who came
forward said that she

26:22.625 --> 26:26.581
was one of the
kids chasing Bobby.

26:26.583 --> 26:27.417
Deputy.

26:28.792 --> 26:29.708
Have a great day.

26:31.500 --> 26:34.333
I have a feeling it's going
to be one helluva night.

26:35.792 --> 26:37.206
Shall we?

26:37.208 --> 26:38.792
Nice to meet you.

26:47.083 --> 26:49.123
So are you gonna lick
the plate clean too?

26:49.125 --> 26:53.000
No, I've still
gotta have my protein shake.

26:54.125 --> 26:55.831
- Do I owe you anything or...
- No.

26:55.833 --> 26:56.790
Did the Sheriff
take care of it all?

26:56.792 --> 26:57.500
No, he took care of it.

27:04.458 --> 27:06.458
That really isn't
necessary, Deputy.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.915
Please.

27:08.917 --> 27:10.125
Call me Trevor.

27:12.375 --> 27:13.375
Thank you.

27:17.208 --> 27:18.042
Whew!

27:27.208 --> 27:28.998
Kind of a boring town.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.415
Keeps you pretty busy.

27:31.417 --> 27:32.250
And?

27:35.958 --> 27:37.542
Bobby Maxwell is kin to me.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.333
I never did get over his death.

27:43.417 --> 27:47.833
That's why I stay in Fall
Creek Valley to find closure.

27:50.375 --> 27:51.625
Can you hear voices?

27:54.042 --> 27:55.042
Sometimes.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.498
How about right now?

27:58.500 --> 27:59.333
Now?

28:02.000 --> 28:05.123
It's the quiet before the storm.

28:11.708 --> 28:12.665
Service!

28:12.667 --> 28:13.500
Hello?

28:14.667 --> 28:16.040
Who's working here these days?

28:16.042 --> 28:16.875
You'll see.

28:19.250 --> 28:20.250
Oh my God!

28:21.208 --> 28:22.208
Reggie?!

28:24.417 --> 28:28.790
Oh my God, I haven't seen
you in like I don't know,

28:28.792 --> 28:30.083
like, 20 years?

28:32.875 --> 28:33.706
Hello?

28:33.708 --> 28:35.206
Could we order now?

28:35.208 --> 28:37.331
God, why does the service
always suck around here?

28:37.333 --> 28:38.958
Very funny, Tiffany.

28:40.417 --> 28:41.831
What can I get you guys?

28:41.833 --> 28:43.040
Coffee.

28:43.042 --> 28:44.958
- Black as midnight on a...
- Black like your soul.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.248
Uh, yeah.

28:47.250 --> 28:49.498
I'll have a grande
no foam soy latte

28:49.500 --> 28:52.040
at exactly 130 degrees please.

28:52.042 --> 28:53.498
Okay.

28:53.500 --> 28:54.956
So two coffees at whatever
temperature I damn well choose

28:54.958 --> 28:56.331
to serve them at!

28:56.333 --> 28:58.456
And I'll go get
those while you guys

28:58.458 --> 29:00.625
take a look at the menus.

29:17.792 --> 29:18.748
What the fuck, Madison?

29:18.750 --> 29:20.623
I can't hear my customers.

29:20.625 --> 29:22.623
The clues, woman, I
need to hear the clues!

29:22.625 --> 29:24.998
Begins
in just a few hours.

29:25.000 --> 29:29.165
The last and final clue
as to its secret location:

29:29.167 --> 29:32.956
"Halloween is no time
for pencils and books

29:32.958 --> 29:36.498
"but time to raise Hell
with devils and ghouls."

29:36.500 --> 29:38.790
Ooh, now that is the
easiest of them all!

29:38.792 --> 29:41.998
Tonight is the night to
rock out with your cock out

29:42.000 --> 29:43.290
if you got one,

29:43.292 --> 29:45.248
if not then jam out
with your clam out!

29:45.250 --> 29:50.250
Brought to
you by 101.6, The RAWK.

29:52.292 --> 29:53.456
Are you guys ready to order?

29:53.458 --> 29:54.956
I want the chocolate
chip pancakes.

29:54.958 --> 29:56.831
Ooh, those sound
so good right now!

29:56.833 --> 29:58.665
I haven't had those
since I was 10!

29:58.667 --> 30:02.040
You guys, we don't have
those on the menu anymore.

30:02.042 --> 30:03.623
Come on!

30:03.625 --> 30:05.208
Arrggh.

30:07.208 --> 30:09.331
Okay, let me see what
kind of influence I have

30:09.333 --> 30:10.248
on the big guy.

30:10.250 --> 30:11.417
I'll be right back.

30:14.125 --> 30:18.042
Wow this place is
like a time capsule.

30:19.500 --> 30:21.667
Yeah that's kind of why I
wanted to bring you here.

30:26.625 --> 30:28.665
I am so sorry about that, guys.

30:28.667 --> 30:31.581
Big Dick McGee has been
like all week crazy

30:31.583 --> 30:34.748
about the clues for that
Hallow-Scream Party.

30:34.750 --> 30:39.542
Oh, tell him to try the
Riverdale University campus.

30:40.583 --> 30:42.081
Okay.

30:42.083 --> 30:45.331
No shit, really?

30:45.333 --> 30:48.248
Well, I mean, that's
based on the last clue.

30:48.250 --> 30:53.123
Um, the DJ mentioned
books, pencils,

30:53.125 --> 30:55.581
and partying with devils.

30:55.583 --> 30:59.623
And I know that the
Riverdale University mascot

30:59.625 --> 31:01.706
is a crimson devil.

31:01.708 --> 31:04.331
So that's just my guess.

31:04.333 --> 31:07.875
So, any chance I'll be
seeing you there tonight?

31:09.125 --> 31:11.665
Um, no, actually we
already have plans.

31:11.667 --> 31:12.956
Madison, Reggie
wants to go with us

31:12.958 --> 31:14.331
to the party at Will's tonight.

31:14.333 --> 31:15.373
Oh, yeah?

31:15.375 --> 31:17.165
Oh I was invited to that party!

31:17.167 --> 31:19.333
Maybe I'll stop in for a few.

31:30.792 --> 31:33.998
Wow, I thought Liz
was into girls now

31:34.000 --> 31:36.917
but I think she's got a
thing for you, Reggie.

31:38.208 --> 31:39.042
Hmm.

31:40.625 --> 31:43.331
Anyways, I'll make sure
to pass on the message.

31:43.333 --> 31:45.706
With any luck, this
will be the first year

31:45.708 --> 31:47.250
he'll actually go to the party.

31:49.042 --> 31:52.248
So, hey, what time can I stop
by for my Halloween costume?

31:52.250 --> 31:54.123
I'll be home by Four.

31:54.125 --> 31:55.915
Okay, cool. Four.

31:55.917 --> 31:58.748
Well I'll stop by then
and, girl, can I just say

31:58.750 --> 32:01.081
I am so glad that you're
coming out with us tonight.

32:01.083 --> 32:02.790
I mean it's about time
you finally got over

32:02.792 --> 32:04.373
your prudish ways.

32:04.375 --> 32:05.206
Whatever.

32:05.208 --> 32:06.248
I am so not a prude.

32:06.250 --> 32:07.915
I had a kid out of wedlock.

32:07.917 --> 32:10.040
Oh, yeah, I guess you just
got your sluttiness on

32:10.042 --> 32:11.623
a little bit too early.

32:11.625 --> 32:13.248
But, hey, oh my God, guess what?

32:13.250 --> 32:14.498
My guy is coming tonight.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.123
Oswald, my internet guy?

32:17.000 --> 32:19.040
Uh, Mask Guy!

32:19.042 --> 32:21.706
What?

32:21.708 --> 32:22.581
Mask?

32:22.583 --> 32:23.750
Who is this Mask Guy?

32:25.875 --> 32:27.498
Well, if you must know,

32:27.500 --> 32:30.123
when me and Oswald
first started chatting,

32:30.125 --> 32:31.623
we would wear masks.

32:31.625 --> 32:33.456
We just thought it would
help us open up a bit more

32:33.458 --> 32:35.498
if we could preserve
the anonymity.

32:35.500 --> 32:36.331
Mm-hmm.

32:36.333 --> 32:37.540
Wow.

32:37.542 --> 32:38.956
Tiffany, you just
keep finding yourself

32:38.958 --> 32:41.081
in weirder and
weirder situations.

32:41.083 --> 32:41.917
Wait.

32:43.333 --> 32:45.790
Were you two wearing masks
when you were having the...

32:45.792 --> 32:47.040
You know.

32:47.042 --> 32:48.331
None of your business!

32:48.333 --> 32:50.956
Okay, it's not what you
wanted but it's free,

32:50.958 --> 32:51.958
it's on the house.

32:55.333 --> 32:56.956
You got the clue right!

32:56.958 --> 32:57.873
What?

32:57.875 --> 33:00.040
Like I said, I like that guy!

33:07.917 --> 33:09.165
Look, that's fine.

33:09.167 --> 33:11.331
Just bring her back
tomorrow at nine.

33:11.333 --> 33:12.498
I just got home from work.

33:12.500 --> 33:14.165
I don't have time for this!

33:14.167 --> 33:15.250
Hi, come in.

33:16.458 --> 33:17.373
Listen, I have guests.

33:17.375 --> 33:18.208
I have to go.

33:26.167 --> 33:28.040
Sorry about that, guys.

33:28.042 --> 33:30.498
Penny is with her Dad tonight.

33:30.500 --> 33:31.998
Is this her?

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
Yup!

33:34.000 --> 33:35.208
That's my little girl.

33:37.583 --> 33:39.540
Wow.

33:39.542 --> 33:42.708
She's looks exactly like you
did when we were that age.

33:48.458 --> 33:51.040
Tiffany, darlin',
Oswald just told me

33:51.042 --> 33:52.748
he's gonna be there at eight!

33:52.750 --> 33:54.081
Oh, Madison, that is fabulous!

33:54.083 --> 33:55.625
- You like it?
- Mm-hmm!

33:56.583 --> 33:57.417
Alright.

34:00.375 --> 34:02.083
Who made these masks?

34:03.000 --> 34:04.415
Uh, Penny did.

34:04.417 --> 34:05.873
Yeah, isn't she a neat kid?

34:07.458 --> 34:08.706
You know what?

34:08.708 --> 34:09.831
She made those in
Mrs. Johnson's class.

34:09.833 --> 34:11.581
- Really?
- Yeah!

34:11.583 --> 34:12.873
That old bat is still alive?

34:12.875 --> 34:14.873
Yeah!

34:15.917 --> 34:17.748
Who says Old Bat anymore?

34:17.750 --> 34:18.998
I do, Tiffany.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.831
Wasn't she like 50 or
100 when we had her?

34:21.833 --> 34:23.790
No, I think she was
in her thirties.

34:23.792 --> 34:25.081
Yeah, you're probably right.

34:25.083 --> 34:27.581
She was probably
only, only looked 50.

34:29.250 --> 34:31.040
Old Mrs. J still has her

34:31.042 --> 34:33.081
Halloween mask
designing contest, huh?

34:33.083 --> 34:34.165
Yup.

34:34.167 --> 34:35.417
She sure does.

34:36.250 --> 34:38.248
Remember when we had ours?

34:38.250 --> 34:41.081
Yeah, you made the Elephant Man.

34:41.083 --> 34:41.915
Come on!

34:41.917 --> 34:43.123
It was horrible!

34:43.125 --> 34:44.915
It was supposed to
be Michael Jackson.

34:44.917 --> 34:45.833
Whatever.

34:47.208 --> 34:50.081
Alex got second place.

34:50.083 --> 34:51.458
I think I got third place.

34:52.875 --> 34:54.083
Who got first place?

34:56.875 --> 34:58.542
As if anybody could forget huh?

35:00.583 --> 35:01.958
Bobby Maxwell.

35:05.500 --> 35:06.917
I totally got cheated.

35:08.958 --> 35:10.373
Cheated?

35:10.375 --> 35:12.415
Yeah I had Old Bat Johnson
a couple years later

35:12.417 --> 35:15.123
and they weren't doing
that mask contest anymore.

35:16.208 --> 35:17.123
Oh!

35:17.125 --> 35:19.040
It's Oswald!

35:19.042 --> 35:20.581
I am just gonna
take this outside.

35:26.125 --> 35:28.956
Yeah, I guess getting
divorced wasn't all that bad.

35:28.958 --> 35:32.081
I got rid of a scumbag and
I got this beautiful house

35:32.083 --> 35:33.915
and three full-time jobs.

35:33.917 --> 35:35.290
Three jobs?

35:35.292 --> 35:36.123
Yeah.

35:36.125 --> 35:37.415
Wow.

35:37.417 --> 35:40.415
Anyways, I want to
hear all about you

35:40.417 --> 35:41.958
and the last 20 years.

35:43.167 --> 35:47.667
Um, nah, it's, you
don't want to hear it.

35:48.833 --> 35:49.998
It's not pretty.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.373
Come on.

35:51.375 --> 35:53.415
It can't all be that bad.

35:53.417 --> 35:54.292
Mostly.

35:58.833 --> 36:00.873
You know, when we
left Fall Creek Valley

36:00.875 --> 36:02.417
I was labeled the troubled kid.

36:03.667 --> 36:06.706
And I guess I just
kind of kept up with

36:06.708 --> 36:08.540
that label ever since.

36:08.542 --> 36:12.123
So 20 years of straight trouble?

36:12.125 --> 36:14.331
Yeah and I've been okay
the past three years.

36:14.333 --> 36:16.665
You know, I've just
been kind of laying low

36:16.667 --> 36:18.831
and staying clean.

36:18.833 --> 36:20.915
What Tiff, she,
Tiffany, hasn't told you

36:20.917 --> 36:22.415
about her deadbeat cousin yet?

36:22.417 --> 36:24.206
Stop it.

36:24.208 --> 36:26.706
She would never
call you a deadbeat.

36:26.708 --> 36:29.415
And believe it or not,
she's very fond of you.

36:29.417 --> 36:31.748
She might be getting
me confused with Alex.

36:31.750 --> 36:36.750
No, she has nice things to
say about you both so stop it.

36:38.167 --> 36:41.540
She said that you have your own
commercial painting company?

36:41.542 --> 36:44.375
That's actually Alex's

36:45.875 --> 36:48.165
and I, you know, I
sometimes kind of manage it

36:48.167 --> 36:50.415
when he's away
playing journalist.

36:50.417 --> 36:53.498
Yeah, Tiffany said
that he's in Africa.

36:53.500 --> 36:55.915
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
he's got this great story

36:55.917 --> 36:57.123
he's really excited about it.

36:57.125 --> 36:59.415
And he thinks he might
win the Pulitzer.

36:59.417 --> 37:00.706
Wow.

37:00.708 --> 37:03.581
Yeah and then we got
an email this morning,

37:03.583 --> 37:04.956
he's on his way to
Fall Creek Valley,

37:04.958 --> 37:06.498
he should be here
tomorrow sometime

37:06.500 --> 37:08.915
so we can go through the
estate sale, you know,

37:08.917 --> 37:10.167
Grandma's estate sale.

37:11.375 --> 37:14.290
Well, it would be really
nice to see him as well.

37:20.625 --> 37:22.581
- Is, do I have...
- There's nothing on you.

37:22.583 --> 37:24.206
- Oh.
- Am I staring?

37:24.208 --> 37:25.331
I'm staring!

37:25.333 --> 37:26.748
I'm staring.

37:26.750 --> 37:27.583
I'm sorry!

37:28.917 --> 37:30.790
It's just so weird!

37:30.792 --> 37:32.456
I can't believe that...

37:32.458 --> 37:34.706
I just can't believe
that you're here!

37:34.708 --> 37:37.083
Standing in front
of me in my house!

37:39.250 --> 37:40.415
You know, I never thought

37:40.417 --> 37:41.917
that I was ever
gonna see you again.

37:43.333 --> 37:44.623
I mean nobody even
knew your parents

37:44.625 --> 37:45.917
were thinking of moving.

37:47.042 --> 37:51.292
Just one day you don't
show up to school.

37:53.458 --> 37:55.792
And then I went to your
house and it was empty.

37:58.958 --> 38:00.792
Tiffany had no idea
where you were.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.373
It was just like your
parents upped and left

38:03.375 --> 38:04.750
and didn't look back.

38:11.167 --> 38:12.706
Okay, we have got
to get out of here.

38:12.708 --> 38:15.500
I have so much to do to get
ready for the party tonight.

38:17.333 --> 38:19.206
Well, I guess we're going.

38:19.208 --> 38:22.456
Yeah I have some really
important emails to check.

38:22.458 --> 38:23.415
I will see you there.

38:23.417 --> 38:24.623
You better not weasel out of it.

38:24.625 --> 38:25.540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:25.542 --> 38:27.040
And I am gonna go start the car

38:27.042 --> 38:28.625
so if you're not there in
30 seconds I'm leaving.

38:36.250 --> 38:37.875
I guess I'll see you tonight.

38:39.042 --> 38:41.373
You can tell me about
your past 20 years, huh?

38:43.000 --> 38:43.833
Yeah.

38:45.708 --> 38:47.208
It was really good seeing you.

38:50.167 --> 38:51.000
I missed you.

39:44.875 --> 39:46.706
I'm sorry, little guy.

39:46.708 --> 39:48.375
I don't have any
candy this year.

39:51.083 --> 39:53.040
You could try going next door.

39:53.042 --> 39:55.250
I think they have some
really cool chocolate.

39:58.208 --> 39:59.500
Are your parents with you?

40:03.458 --> 40:04.833
Do you speak English?

40:06.083 --> 40:06.958
Habla Espanol?

40:11.375 --> 40:12.750
What are you supposed to be?

40:15.667 --> 40:16.706
It looks familiar.

40:16.708 --> 40:18.375
Is it from a movie?

40:42.458 --> 40:44.333
Listen, kid, I don't
have any candy.

40:45.625 --> 40:46.623
I'm really sorry.

40:46.625 --> 40:48.792
I can give you an apple.

40:54.417 --> 40:55.917
I don't know what to tell you.

40:56.792 --> 40:58.456
Try the neighbors.

40:58.458 --> 41:00.623
I'm sure there's gonna be
houses that have candy.

41:00.625 --> 41:02.290
Okay?

41:02.292 --> 41:03.540
Happy Halloween!

41:51.542 --> 41:52.833
You've had your fun!

41:54.833 --> 41:56.415
Now get the hell out of here!

43:56.458 --> 44:01.458
Boop Boop Boop. I see you.

44:02.667 --> 44:04.165
Oh yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

44:04.167 --> 44:05.000
Hey!

44:11.625 --> 44:14.667
klaatu barada nikto

44:15.417 --> 44:16.998
Hmm, the Devil!

44:17.000 --> 44:18.708

44:22.333 --> 44:24.123
Ha ha ha!

44:24.125 --> 44:25.625
Okay hmm mum murm.

44:27.667 --> 44:30.498
Uh, you listen to me.

44:30.500 --> 44:31.915
Fall Creek Valley.

44:31.917 --> 44:33.998
I'm El Diablo!

44:34.000 --> 44:36.331
I'm a horny devil!

44:36.333 --> 44:37.581
Oh, Madison!

44:37.583 --> 44:40.373
Titty titty titty titty titty!

44:40.375 --> 44:42.542
Oh give it to me, Madison!

44:44.708 --> 44:47.375
Great!

44:49.625 --> 44:51.708
It's all your fault!

45:06.375 --> 45:07.958
Trick or treat!

45:44.792 --> 45:46.081
Oh Jesus, Tiff.

45:46.083 --> 45:47.415
What has the bastard
done with the place?

45:47.417 --> 45:48.248
I'm not.

45:48.250 --> 45:49.498
It's...

45:49.500 --> 45:50.665
It looks way different
than it used to before.

45:50.667 --> 45:52.081
Oh my God, quit stalling Reggie.

45:52.083 --> 45:54.540
There's gonna be lots of
people in there that you know.

45:54.542 --> 45:56.706
I have to find Madison
real fast to get my phone

45:56.708 --> 45:59.415
'cause I just know Oswald's
been texting me like a madman!

45:59.417 --> 46:01.167
Come on!

46:02.708 --> 46:06.081
So then I said,
"B cup not C cup!"

46:16.792 --> 46:17.790
Whoa!

46:17.792 --> 46:19.290
Tiffy baby!

46:19.292 --> 46:22.956
You are lookin' smokin' tonight.

46:22.958 --> 46:24.248
Give us a twirl.

46:24.250 --> 46:25.956
Thanks, Madison made
this costume for me.

46:25.958 --> 46:27.583
Is she here by the way?

46:28.833 --> 46:30.331
Uh!

46:30.333 --> 46:33.581
Who is the man who's lucky
enough to be your date?

46:34.958 --> 46:36.958
You remember Reggie, my cousin?

46:38.292 --> 46:39.706
Oh!

46:39.708 --> 46:40.831
Whoa!

46:40.833 --> 46:41.790
Dude!

46:41.792 --> 46:42.998
I haven't seen you in a minute!

46:43.000 --> 46:43.956
Oh!

46:43.958 --> 46:45.456
Jeez, the last time I saw you...

46:45.458 --> 46:47.458
You were shoving my
head in a toilet.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.290
Well that couldn't have been
the very last time I saw you?

46:51.292 --> 46:53.665
That was actually the incident

46:53.667 --> 46:56.167
that made my family move
out of Fall Creek Valley.

46:59.625 --> 47:00.456
Uh.

47:00.458 --> 47:01.706
Wow!

47:01.708 --> 47:03.498
I mean, it
was a long time ago,

47:03.500 --> 47:04.540
we we were all kids then.

47:04.542 --> 47:07.748
We're all grown up now, mature.

47:07.750 --> 47:09.875
Let bygones be bygones.

47:15.167 --> 47:16.456
Come on, let's get some brews!

47:16.458 --> 47:18.333
Yeah come on, Reggie!

47:22.542 --> 47:25.831
Ah, only the finest!

47:25.833 --> 47:27.165
Pacifico Clara!

47:27.167 --> 47:27.998
Eh!

47:28.000 --> 47:28.956
I'm alright, actually.

47:31.375 --> 47:32.665
Do you want a beer?

47:32.667 --> 47:35.540
Do you want to pick that
up too when you're done?

47:35.542 --> 47:36.665
Just kiddin', man!

47:36.667 --> 47:37.915
Thanks, Willy.

47:37.917 --> 47:39.748
Oh, it's Will now.

47:39.750 --> 47:40.956
It's more manly.

47:40.958 --> 47:44.123
Yeah, yeah ladies seem
to like it better.

47:44.125 --> 47:44.958
By the way,

47:46.583 --> 47:50.206
did I tell you that you are
lookin' smokin' tonight?

47:50.208 --> 47:53.456
Yes, you did and where
is your wife by the way?

47:53.458 --> 47:54.998
All the way in Nevada.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.040
With the kids.

47:56.042 --> 47:57.540
Parents' house.

47:57.542 --> 48:00.373
Hmm so is that why you're not
wearing your wedding ring?

48:00.375 --> 48:03.540
Nah, the ring didn't
really go with the costume.

48:03.542 --> 48:04.373
Hmm.

48:04.375 --> 48:05.540
Hmm.

48:05.542 --> 48:06.915
Yeah so I have to find
Madison really bad

48:06.917 --> 48:08.042
and get my phone.

48:09.042 --> 48:10.290
Come on, Reggie.

48:10.292 --> 48:13.375
Um, yeah, cell phones suck!

48:14.583 --> 48:16.373
I thought you said he
wasn't all that bad.

48:16.375 --> 48:18.873
He's a bigger jerk now
than when he was 10!

48:18.875 --> 48:20.831
Uh, you just have to
catch him on the right day

48:20.833 --> 48:23.748
and, believe me, that
macho attitude of his

48:23.750 --> 48:26.081
is definitely compensating
for something.

48:26.083 --> 48:28.206
I don't even want to
know how you know that.

48:28.208 --> 48:29.248
No, you probably don't!

48:33.250 --> 48:34.706
Arrgh!

48:34.708 --> 48:37.915
As long as he has a big fat...

48:37.917 --> 48:38.748
Yeah.

48:38.750 --> 48:39.665
Sausages are great!

48:39.667 --> 48:41.331
I wanna bite it!

48:41.333 --> 48:43.123
Ooh!

48:43.125 --> 48:44.748
Who is this hot ma ma ma?

48:44.750 --> 48:46.750
Hey, Erica!

48:47.583 --> 48:49.083
Hey, you know Reggie, right?

48:50.792 --> 48:52.498
Hey, hey.

48:54.083 --> 48:54.917
Girl!

48:56.167 --> 48:56.998
Whoa!

48:58.792 --> 49:01.956
Girl, you look so hot right now!

49:01.958 --> 49:03.292
Get a picture of us!

49:05.292 --> 49:06.667
Hi!

49:08.083 --> 49:10.373
And to think that you are
the wife of a Preacher's Son.

49:10.375 --> 49:11.456
Correction.

49:11.458 --> 49:12.956
Engaged.

49:12.958 --> 49:15.248
But I do not want to think
about that right now.

49:15.250 --> 49:19.790
I am so tired of being
the old Church lady.

49:19.792 --> 49:21.625
Tonight I let loose.

49:23.250 --> 49:24.375
Ohh!

49:32.917 --> 49:35.373
Drink another beer!

49:35.375 --> 49:36.873
Drink, drink!

49:36.875 --> 49:39.456
Is he really Big Dick McGee.

49:40.417 --> 49:42.540
Bring that big dick over here.

49:42.542 --> 49:45.248
Oh, I love that Big Dick McGee!

49:45.250 --> 49:46.040
Well!

49:46.042 --> 49:47.581
Hey, hey, hey!

49:47.583 --> 49:48.498
Hey, Rick.

49:48.500 --> 49:49.498
The party has just arrived!

49:49.500 --> 49:50.790
What is up, Tiff?!

49:50.792 --> 49:52.290
Nothing.

49:52.292 --> 49:54.708
Hey, you know Reggie!

49:56.292 --> 49:58.123
Holy, Re, what?

49:58.125 --> 49:59.540
Our Reggie Reggie?

49:59.542 --> 50:00.375
Dude!

50:01.333 --> 50:03.998
Shit, it's been like 20 years!

50:04.000 --> 50:04.831
God, dude!

50:04.833 --> 50:05.873
What's up man?

50:05.875 --> 50:07.290
Wow!

50:07.292 --> 50:08.665
And Tiff, I am sorry Tiff,

50:08.667 --> 50:10.665
you are just looking absolutely
stunning in that, girl.

50:15.042 --> 50:17.167
- Looking fabulous!
- Hey, Rick!

50:18.708 --> 50:20.375
Like my costume?

50:21.875 --> 50:22.706
Oh!

50:22.708 --> 50:24.917
Well, yes, I do Erica.

50:26.042 --> 50:27.206
You look good.

50:27.208 --> 50:28.040
Hmm.

50:28.042 --> 50:28.915
You look real good.

50:30.500 --> 50:31.331
You always look good!

50:32.542 --> 50:35.540
But tonight you look
downright yummy!

50:37.167 --> 50:39.915
I'm sure that's just that
beer right there talking, huh?

50:39.917 --> 50:41.415
If it wasn't that one,

50:41.417 --> 50:42.498
it might have been the six
I had before it though.

50:43.792 --> 50:44.583
Hey!

50:45.500 --> 50:46.790
Rick, Reggie.

50:46.792 --> 50:48.373
Remember, Rick.

50:48.375 --> 50:49.831
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:49.833 --> 50:51.373
I was just talking to him.

50:51.375 --> 50:53.500
Dude, seriously, man, how
the hell you been, bro?

50:54.708 --> 50:58.290
Uh, good I suppose, how are you?

50:58.292 --> 50:59.248
Aw, shit, man.

50:59.250 --> 51:01.415
I'm cool, cool, man, I'm cool.

51:01.417 --> 51:03.081
I'm still stuck here
in Fall Creek Valley

51:03.083 --> 51:06.540
but other than that I
can't complain, you know.

51:06.542 --> 51:08.623
Ugh, I hate to interrupt
this little love fest

51:08.625 --> 51:10.581
but has anybody seen Madison?

51:10.583 --> 51:13.331
Nope, she probably
bailed out on us.

51:13.333 --> 51:16.290
She is not fun since
she left Robbie.

51:16.292 --> 51:17.498
Yeah, whatever.

51:17.500 --> 51:18.748
Tonight we have bait!

51:25.917 --> 51:26.748
Erica!

51:26.750 --> 51:27.915
Snap, it's all right!

51:27.917 --> 51:29.456
We might
have to just go ahead

51:29.458 --> 51:30.831
and get you another drink.

51:32.250 --> 51:36.081
I mean, I know of a special
little cocktail recipe

51:36.083 --> 51:37.081
that I know you'll enjoy!

51:37.083 --> 51:38.123
Oh!

51:39.083 --> 51:41.125
I want to catch up with Reggie.

51:42.333 --> 51:45.290
See what life has handed to him.

51:45.292 --> 51:47.748
See if it's been any
better than the rest of us

51:47.750 --> 51:50.331
who stayed back in Fall
Creek Valley to rot.

51:50.333 --> 51:51.790
Who's rotting girl?

51:51.792 --> 51:52.873
You just got engaged.

51:52.875 --> 51:54.498
Shh!

51:54.500 --> 51:56.958
Tonight I am a single lady!

51:59.625 --> 52:01.123
Tomorrow when I wake up,

52:01.125 --> 52:04.458
I'll go back to being the
soon to be Wife of a Preacher.

52:05.625 --> 52:10.456
Well
then, on that note,

52:10.458 --> 52:12.373
how about we go
get you that drink?

52:12.375 --> 52:15.956
And we'll catch up with Reg
and Tiff in a little bit?

52:15.958 --> 52:19.998
Come on, I know where Will
hides the good tequila.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.333
I wanna dance!

52:25.167 --> 52:27.956
You know what?

52:27.958 --> 52:29.790
I better go get that girl.

52:29.792 --> 52:31.165
Something tells me that
someone is gonna have to

52:31.167 --> 52:34.581
help hold her hair
back later on tonight.

52:34.583 --> 52:38.540
So, dude, seriously, it was
great seeing you again, man.

52:38.542 --> 52:41.498
We'll catch up later, alright?

52:41.500 --> 52:42.540
Tiff!

52:43.792 --> 52:45.500
Oh my gosh, she is such
a hot mess right now!

52:48.125 --> 52:49.542
Hey, are you okay, Reggie?

52:50.417 --> 52:51.915
I'm just...

52:51.917 --> 52:53.415
I'm just a little anxious.

52:53.417 --> 52:55.998
I just keep seeing these
people that I haven't seen

52:56.000 --> 52:57.248
since I left.

52:58.167 --> 53:00.248
Hey, I know just what you need.

53:00.250 --> 53:01.081
Come on!

53:01.083 --> 53:02.167
Come with me.

53:06.458 --> 53:11.375
So okay, so then the dog
said, fur not furbie!

53:19.667 --> 53:22.540
I happen to know
of a secret stash

53:22.542 --> 53:24.831
that William keeps out here.

53:24.833 --> 53:26.581
And I think it will
be just the thing

53:26.583 --> 53:30.081
to calm those nerves of yours.

53:30.083 --> 53:32.250
Oh, let's see, here it is.

53:34.167 --> 53:35.000
Here.

53:39.042 --> 53:40.415
I thought you were
desperate to find Maddie.

53:40.417 --> 53:42.998
I am, I am, I just
I need something

53:43.000 --> 53:44.458
to calm my nerves real quick.

53:47.333 --> 53:50.125
Wow, you really are nervous
about meeting Oswald, huh?

53:52.792 --> 53:56.792
Yeah, I actually really
like him, Reggie.

53:58.542 --> 54:00.292
What do you really
know about this guy?

54:01.417 --> 54:04.706
I know you
don't take it seriously

54:04.708 --> 54:06.123
'cause we met online
and everything

54:06.125 --> 54:10.583
but we've really talked a lot.

54:11.500 --> 54:13.292
We've really kind of connected

54:15.792 --> 54:17.333
and shown each other our souls.

54:19.250 --> 54:21.248
By souls do you mean genitals?

54:24.833 --> 54:27.040
Oh my God, Reggie!

54:27.042 --> 54:28.456
I'm trying to have a
moment with you here.

54:37.667 --> 54:39.625
Do you want to walk down
to Madison's with me?

54:41.292 --> 54:44.625
Is it cool if I
just hang out here?

54:45.583 --> 54:46.956
I just, I don't know,

54:46.958 --> 54:48.500
I just need some alone time.

54:50.750 --> 54:51.917
It's cool.

54:53.292 --> 54:57.792
Well, I will be back with
Madison so don't go anywhere.

54:58.833 --> 55:00.623
I'll be right here.

55:23.625 --> 55:24.956
This is
Sheriff Leavitt.

55:24.958 --> 55:27.456
We got an abandoned
vehicle at Borden Pass.

55:27.458 --> 55:29.123
A gold Impala.

55:29.125 --> 55:30.625
California plates.

55:31.792 --> 55:34.500
Alpha Romeo One
Two Zero Charlie.

56:16.458 --> 56:18.540
That gold
Impala is registered

56:18.542 --> 56:21.042
under the name of
Reggie Griffin.

56:42.750 --> 56:45.706
Come on, Madison, I
know you're in there!

56:45.708 --> 56:47.208
I really need to get my phone!

56:52.708 --> 56:53.542
Madison?

56:59.292 --> 57:01.873
Maddy, I think I left
my phone over here.

57:04.417 --> 57:05.665
Ugh!

57:05.667 --> 57:07.540
Oswald's probably been
calling me nonstop.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.748
Come on, Madison, you promised
you'd go to Will's party!

57:11.750 --> 57:14.042
Huh?!

57:34.167 --> 57:35.958
Okay ha-ha, Madison!

57:37.250 --> 57:38.708
This isn't funny anymore.

58:02.500 --> 58:03.540
I didn't spill a drop!

58:07.083 --> 58:09.248
Where are we going?

58:09.250 --> 58:11.958
Hey, guys!

58:33.792 --> 58:35.915
Did you hear that?

58:35.917 --> 58:38.000
I didn't hear anything.

58:39.292 --> 58:41.831
I must be hearing things.

58:41.833 --> 58:43.875
I thought I heard a kid.

58:49.583 --> 58:52.375
All your focus right now.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.417
Needs to be right here on me.

59:05.542 --> 59:07.583
In the love shack!

59:09.625 --> 59:12.042
Are you trying to seduce me?

59:13.042 --> 59:13.875
Hmm.

59:30.042 --> 59:32.123
Did you hear that?

59:32.125 --> 59:33.915
I think someone's out there.

59:33.917 --> 59:34.915
You know what?

59:34.917 --> 59:35.790
Just fuck me.

59:35.792 --> 59:37.248
Oh!

59:37.250 --> 59:38.248
Can't you just...

59:38.250 --> 59:40.248
Can't you just go scope it out?

59:40.250 --> 59:41.456
I'm serious.

59:41.458 --> 59:43.248
I just, I won't be comfortable

59:43.250 --> 59:45.831
if I know someone's right there.

59:45.833 --> 59:47.375
Come on, you know my situation.

59:48.917 --> 59:50.165
Can you just.

59:50.167 --> 59:53.248
Can you just please,
please try, please?

59:53.250 --> 59:54.290
Alright.

59:54.292 --> 59:55.708
- Alright.
- Come on.

01:00:00.958 --> 01:00:04.083
You'll still be ready
when I get back?

01:00:07.208 --> 01:00:09.792
I guess I'll have to
keep myself warm won't I?

01:00:13.083 --> 01:00:14.583
Don't be too long.

01:00:18.333 --> 01:00:19.167
I won't be.

01:00:20.542 --> 01:00:21.375
Sexy.

01:00:30.625 --> 01:00:33.790
Hello?

01:00:45.833 --> 01:00:46.667
Hello?

01:00:49.917 --> 01:00:51.042
Somebody there?

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:06.333
Rick?

01:01:08.458 --> 01:01:09.292
Hello?

01:01:35.708 --> 01:01:36.625
Ugh!

01:01:37.458 --> 01:01:38.292
Ugh!

01:01:41.958 --> 01:01:42.792
Huh!

01:01:49.958 --> 01:01:51.206
The fuck was that?

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:52.831
Holy shit, you're bleeding!

01:01:52.833 --> 01:01:53.667
No shit!

01:01:55.375 --> 01:01:56.665
I think it's...

01:01:56.667 --> 01:01:57.623
I think...

01:01:57.625 --> 01:01:58.956
I think it's him.

01:01:58.958 --> 01:01:59.998
I think it's him!

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Him, who?!

01:02:04.083 --> 01:02:05.706
He's getting up!

01:02:17.417 --> 01:02:18.250
Hey, man.

01:02:20.375 --> 01:02:21.290
Hey.

01:02:21.292 --> 01:02:22.083
Can I borrow your lighter?

01:02:24.292 --> 01:02:25.540
Hey!

01:02:25.542 --> 01:02:27.248
The fuck you guys
doin' out here?

01:02:27.250 --> 01:02:28.792
Not smoking marijuana, are you?

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.873
I'm just kiddin', man!

01:02:32.875 --> 01:02:33.790
Ha!

01:02:33.792 --> 01:02:35.248
Actually this is a safe spot.

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:36.748
You know, I have a
hidden stash out here.

01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:38.748
I kinda, you know, get away
from the ole ball and chain.

01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:39.748
Get my smoke on.

01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:41.165
Hey, let me hit that.

01:02:41.167 --> 01:02:43.750
Suck on this little
testicle you got for a pipe.

01:02:47.375 --> 01:02:48.208
You alright, man?

01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:50.456
Hey!

01:02:50.458 --> 01:02:51.290
I just got a headache.

01:02:51.292 --> 01:02:52.956
That's all.

01:02:52.958 --> 01:02:55.456
Try some of this, it'll
make you feel better.

01:02:55.458 --> 01:02:56.540
I'm good.

01:02:56.542 --> 01:02:57.625
Oh, you're okay.

01:02:58.792 --> 01:03:00.998
You're not seeing what
I am seeing, dumb ass.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.123
Anyway, actually
I appreciate it,

01:03:02.125 --> 01:03:03.956
I have to go take a piss.

01:03:03.958 --> 01:03:05.958
See you asswipes on
the flip side, huh?

01:03:11.208 --> 01:03:12.292
I'm really nervous.

01:03:13.458 --> 01:03:15.456
I'm meeting a lady
friend here tonight.

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:17.250
A chick I met online.

01:03:20.875 --> 01:03:23.040
What did you say your name was?

01:03:23.042 --> 01:03:23.875
I didn't.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.290
Oswald.

01:03:28.667 --> 01:03:29.706
Reggie.

01:03:31.333 --> 01:03:35.248
Yeah, don't worry, I'm sure
you'll hear from her soon.

01:03:36.375 --> 01:03:37.206
Reggie, huh?

01:03:37.208 --> 01:03:38.498
Mm-hmm.

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.583
That is a name you
don't hear everyday.

01:03:42.292 --> 01:03:45.375
You wouldn't happen to be
Tiffany's cousin Reggie would you?

01:03:47.333 --> 01:03:48.165
Mm-hmm.

01:03:48.167 --> 01:03:49.331
Shit, man!

01:03:49.333 --> 01:03:50.665
That's who I'm here to meet!

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:52.373
Ya don't say?

01:03:53.625 --> 01:03:54.917
Yeah, Tiff Tiff
will be here soon.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.833
Oh, man, what a small world.

01:03:59.667 --> 01:04:00.956
You know, I was hopin'

01:04:00.958 --> 01:04:03.665
I would get to meet
you sooner or later.

01:04:03.667 --> 01:04:05.331
I have been doing some research

01:04:05.333 --> 01:04:07.623
and trying to get
in touch with you.

01:04:07.625 --> 01:04:09.998
And then it turns out
you are the cousin

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.456
of the girl I am
chatting with online.

01:04:12.458 --> 01:04:14.042
It is great to finally meet you!

01:04:15.125 --> 01:04:17.542
Why would you want to meet me?

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:21.206
I do an internet show

01:04:21.208 --> 01:04:23.458
and wanted to do a couple
segments about you.

01:04:24.708 --> 01:04:27.206
I just think you are
an interesting cat

01:04:27.208 --> 01:04:31.000
and I want to know more
about you, Reggie Griffin.

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:34.748
You know, actually,

01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:36.706
I think I need to go inside.

01:04:36.708 --> 01:04:38.373
I think I need to take a piss.

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:39.581
Uh, yeah, yeah, man.

01:04:39.583 --> 01:04:41.915
Hey, hey, maybe we
should re-up on brews!

01:04:41.917 --> 01:04:43.873
You know, you can tell me
about yourself you know?

01:04:43.875 --> 01:04:44.706
Like hobbies?

01:04:44.708 --> 01:04:45.665
Favorite foods?

01:04:45.667 --> 01:04:48.456
What your childhood was like?

01:04:48.458 --> 01:04:49.956
You know what?

01:04:49.958 --> 01:04:52.540
I don't think Tiffany is
gonna be coming by tonight.

01:04:52.542 --> 01:04:54.081
I think she said
she's gonna be sick.

01:04:54.083 --> 01:04:54.915
What?

01:04:54.917 --> 01:04:55.748
Dude!

01:04:56.583 --> 01:04:58.248
Fuck!

01:04:58.250 --> 01:05:00.331
What's up with the line, I
gotta piss like a racehorse!

01:05:00.333 --> 01:05:01.790
Really, Will?

01:05:01.792 --> 01:05:03.998
You throw a party and you
only have one working toilet?

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.665
Okay, first of all,
the contractors told me

01:05:06.667 --> 01:05:09.498
that the remodeling would
be done like two weeks ago.

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:11.915
And I paid those
fucktards the money

01:05:11.917 --> 01:05:13.831
and now I haven't
seen them since!

01:05:13.833 --> 01:05:15.123
Second of all, there's
a big gaping hole

01:05:15.125 --> 01:05:16.623
in the bathroom upstairs.

01:05:16.625 --> 01:05:18.873
Ooh, boo-hoo, sob story.

01:05:18.875 --> 01:05:20.290
It still sucks though.

01:05:20.292 --> 01:05:21.498
Slutty Bumble Bee
has been in there

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.415
for what seems like an eternity!

01:05:23.417 --> 01:05:24.915
Tell that bitch ass to hurry up

01:05:24.917 --> 01:05:26.415
and get out of there!

01:05:26.417 --> 01:05:28.081
Sometimes you just gotta
put them in their place!

01:05:28.083 --> 01:05:29.540
They're called women, Will.

01:05:30.458 --> 01:05:32.290
We aren't just one of your bros.

01:05:32.292 --> 01:05:34.040
You can't talk like
that in front of a lady.

01:05:34.042 --> 01:05:35.081
Mmm-mmm.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.248
Okay, first of all,

01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:41.956
I don't consider you
two tuna cans ladies.

01:05:41.958 --> 01:05:43.456
Second of all don't
you, you know,

01:05:43.458 --> 01:05:45.456
go fishing on each other?

01:05:45.458 --> 01:05:46.665
We're gay, yes,

01:05:46.667 --> 01:05:48.498
but we're still
considered women.

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:50.123
Right.

01:05:53.958 --> 01:05:56.415
Lezbo Liz.

01:05:56.417 --> 01:05:57.873
Lez lesbian Liz.

01:05:57.875 --> 01:06:02.875
Liz Lizbo and her muff-diving
sidekick, Dykey Deli.

01:06:03.625 --> 01:06:04.790
Thank you, thank you

01:06:04.792 --> 01:06:06.290
for reminding me
why I prefer women.

01:06:07.333 --> 01:06:09.081
I really have to pee!

01:06:09.083 --> 01:06:10.540
I'm tempted to go
water those rosebushes

01:06:10.542 --> 01:06:11.456
outside your house.

01:06:11.458 --> 01:06:13.290
You are not pissing in my yard.

01:06:13.292 --> 01:06:14.123
Why not?

01:06:14.125 --> 01:06:15.331
All the guys have been.

01:06:15.333 --> 01:06:16.165
What?

01:06:16.167 --> 01:06:17.415
Who the fuck did that?

01:06:17.417 --> 01:06:18.665
You know what, I'm
gonna handle this.

01:06:18.667 --> 01:06:19.581
Oh!

01:06:19.583 --> 01:06:21.040
Hey!

01:06:21.042 --> 01:06:22.915
Why don't you snap that
turd off and get outta here?

01:06:22.917 --> 01:06:24.165
Huh?

01:06:24.167 --> 01:06:25.165
There are people like
getting angry out here

01:06:25.167 --> 01:06:26.333
trying to get in there!

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:29.498
Will!

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:30.915
Do you always have to
be such a douchebag?!

01:06:32.167 --> 01:06:33.167
Douche your bag.

01:06:35.583 --> 01:06:36.415
Uh!

01:06:36.417 --> 01:06:37.248
What?!

01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:39.456
My house my rules.

01:06:39.458 --> 01:06:40.831
I don't wait for nobody.

01:06:40.833 --> 01:06:42.081
Fuck you, Will!

01:06:42.083 --> 01:06:42.998
Hey!

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:45.040
Knock it off out there!

01:06:45.042 --> 01:06:46.665
You're going to scare
the piss back in!

01:06:47.917 --> 01:06:49.415
You're such a
fuckin' jerk, Will.

01:06:49.417 --> 01:06:50.540
I'm going to go piss in the
middle of your front lawn!

01:06:50.542 --> 01:06:53.165
Yeah I dare ya, Lizbo.

01:06:53.167 --> 01:06:54.498
I hope when you're
crouching out there

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:57.290
a lesbian bug flies
up your cooch!

01:06:58.500 --> 01:06:59.540
You two will be
very happy together!

01:06:59.542 --> 01:07:00.873
Eat shit, Will!

01:07:00.875 --> 01:07:01.873
I'm gonna go in your bedroom

01:07:01.875 --> 01:07:03.456
and piss on your
pillows instead!

01:07:03.458 --> 01:07:05.373
Oh, yeah, try it, rugmuncher.

01:07:05.375 --> 01:07:08.165
You don't think I didn't
lock the door to the bedroom?

01:07:10.875 --> 01:07:12.081
Get the fuck out!

01:07:24.792 --> 01:07:25.625
Hi!

01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:28.375
You, don't you
work at the diner?

01:07:29.250 --> 01:07:31.331
Yeah, that's right, handsome.

01:07:31.333 --> 01:07:32.706
I never did catch your
name this afternoon.

01:07:32.708 --> 01:07:33.540
Reggie.

01:07:33.542 --> 01:07:34.498
Hey, Liz.

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:35.540
Nice to meet you, Reggie.

01:07:35.542 --> 01:07:36.748
Nice meet you.

01:07:36.750 --> 01:07:37.706
I'm Deli.

01:07:37.708 --> 01:07:38.750
Liz's girlfriend.

01:07:43.958 --> 01:07:45.415
Uh, let me guess.

01:07:45.417 --> 01:07:47.081
Let me guess.

01:07:47.083 --> 01:07:48.331
Ladybug?

01:07:48.333 --> 01:07:49.790
Lumberjack!

01:07:49.792 --> 01:07:51.167
Whatta dick!

01:07:55.042 --> 01:07:56.583
She wasn't wearing a costume!

01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:58.415
Oh!

01:07:58.417 --> 01:07:59.165
I didn't mean anything by it.

01:07:59.167 --> 01:08:00.248
I'm sorry.

01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:01.081
Naw, don't worry about it.

01:08:01.083 --> 01:08:02.331
She's just PMS-ing.

01:08:02.333 --> 01:08:04.000
Makes me wanna go
back to men again.

01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:11.290
So, is this still the only
bathroom in the house?

01:08:11.292 --> 01:08:12.915
Yeah, I've been
waiting here forever.

01:08:12.917 --> 01:08:15.248
Then Will cut in front of me.

01:08:15.250 --> 01:08:17.290
Been in there like
10 minutes now.

01:08:17.292 --> 01:08:19.415
Knowing him he's doing
hand-to-gland combat

01:08:19.417 --> 01:08:20.747
while dreaming of Deli.

01:08:20.750 --> 01:08:21.750
He's such a jerk!

01:08:22.707 --> 01:08:24.165
Hurry up, Will!

01:08:24.167 --> 01:08:26.831
The line has tripled since
you've gone in there!

01:08:26.832 --> 01:08:29.040
Will!

01:08:29.042 --> 01:08:31.331
Goddammit!

01:08:31.332 --> 01:08:34.000
You know, I used to
live in this house.

01:08:34.875 --> 01:08:36.706
And the door is a little,

01:08:36.707 --> 01:08:38.165
there's a little trick with it.

01:08:38.167 --> 01:08:39.956
I could get us in there if
you wanted to get back at him,

01:08:39.957 --> 01:08:40.956
we could open...

01:08:40.957 --> 01:08:41.915
Hell, yeah!

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:43.122
What are you waiting for?

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.081
Wait, Reggie, what is that?

01:08:51.082 --> 01:08:51.917
What's what?

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.750
I think it's blood.

01:08:55.875 --> 01:08:56.707
Whoa!

01:08:59.125 --> 01:09:03.290
Will!

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:23.456
Someone should call the cops.

01:09:27.125 --> 01:09:28.956
911, what's
your emergency?

01:09:28.957 --> 01:09:30.665
I'm at this party.

01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:32.415
And someone is dead outside.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:39.917
Huh!

01:10:02.375 --> 01:10:04.208
Please, let me go!

01:10:06.833 --> 01:10:08.125
I remember you.

01:10:09.167 --> 01:10:11.081
You're Bobby Maxwell!

01:10:16.625 --> 01:10:17.458
Madison!

01:10:18.958 --> 01:10:19.873
Reggie!

01:10:57.208 --> 01:10:58.706
Argh!

01:11:34.125 --> 01:11:35.456
Madison.

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:36.292
No!

01:11:37.625 --> 01:11:38.708
Maddy!

01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:24.331
Freeze!

01:13:24.333 --> 01:13:26.250
Reggie, you're done!

01:13:29.542 --> 01:13:31.248
What happened tonight?

01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:32.083
I stabbed him.

01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:34.667
He was right there.

01:13:36.125 --> 01:13:37.333
Who did you stab?

01:13:38.583 --> 01:13:39.748
Bobby Maxwell, he,

01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:41.333
he came back and killed Tiffany.

01:13:42.708 --> 01:13:44.167
Bobby Maxwell?

01:13:45.375 --> 01:13:46.873
I guess the next thing
you are gonna tell us

01:13:46.875 --> 01:13:49.040
is that Bobby Maxwell also
killed the man we found

01:13:49.042 --> 01:13:50.748
in the trunk of your car.

01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:51.583
What?

01:13:53.125 --> 01:13:54.915
Don't play innocent, Reggie.

01:13:54.917 --> 01:13:57.165
The man's name was Ash Simpson.

01:13:57.167 --> 01:14:00.290
You killed him, his
girlfriend Crystal Cochran,

01:14:00.292 --> 01:14:01.498
and everybody else tonight.

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:02.333
No.

01:14:03.292 --> 01:14:04.123
No.

01:14:04.125 --> 01:14:05.667
It was Bobby Maxwell.

01:14:07.792 --> 01:14:09.625
He killed Tiffany,
Madison, Erica and Will.

01:14:12.125 --> 01:14:13.083
I saw their bodies.

01:14:14.333 --> 01:14:15.415
You forgot about Rick?

01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:16.956
Rick, too?

01:14:16.958 --> 01:14:17.792
Cut the crap.

01:14:20.417 --> 01:14:21.581
None of this was me.

01:14:21.583 --> 01:14:23.040
I didn't hurt
anyone except Bobby.

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:25.875
I stabbed him and
he was right there.

01:14:27.042 --> 01:14:29.748
There is no Bobby Maxwell.

01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:31.458
Reggie, it was you.

01:14:34.292 --> 01:14:36.458
Is this some kind of
twisted revenge thing?

01:14:37.542 --> 01:14:39.083
Are you still holding a grudge?

01:14:40.292 --> 01:14:41.125
No.

01:14:42.250 --> 01:14:47.000
You pathetic, pill
poppin' piece of shit!

01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:51.415
I always knew you were no good.

01:14:51.417 --> 01:14:54.250
But I never ever thought you'd
be capable of any of this.

01:14:55.333 --> 01:14:56.167
I'm not.

01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:58.667
It was Bobby Maxwell.

01:15:00.375 --> 01:15:02.623
It was all Bobby Maxwell.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.206
What are you doing here?

01:15:18.208 --> 01:15:20.875
I'm interested in a case.

01:15:21.875 --> 01:15:23.831
We got a situation.

01:15:23.833 --> 01:15:25.750
Those voices in your head, huh?

01:15:26.958 --> 01:15:28.665
They're not gonna
help you anymore.

01:15:28.667 --> 01:15:30.706
You want this to
be over tonight?

01:15:30.708 --> 01:15:31.542
Right now?

01:15:32.708 --> 01:15:33.998
Tell me the truth.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.790
I'm a Paranormal
Forensic Investigator.

01:15:36.792 --> 01:15:38.873
I don't got time for this.

01:15:38.875 --> 01:15:40.375
I got cop shit to do.

01:15:41.875 --> 01:15:43.665
Every one of us was to blame.

01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:49.248
We were ruthless with
the name-calling.

01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:50.956
The incessant bullying.

01:15:50.958 --> 01:15:52.915
You never fought back.

01:15:52.917 --> 01:15:54.165
You stayed to yourself

01:15:54.167 --> 01:15:55.748
and tried to hide in
those comic books.

01:15:59.417 --> 01:16:00.833
We just kept after ya.

01:16:02.417 --> 01:16:05.000
You just stayed in
those comic books.

01:16:07.083 --> 01:16:11.415
You deserve your revenge
but no one deserved to die.

01:16:11.417 --> 01:16:14.792
Not like this.

01:16:16.417 --> 01:16:18.292
Get the fuck off my crime scene.

01:16:19.125 --> 01:16:19.956
I can't do that.

01:16:19.958 --> 01:16:21.206
It's too important.

01:16:21.208 --> 01:16:23.581
Just give me a few minutes.

01:16:23.583 --> 01:16:24.417
Talk to me.

01:16:25.583 --> 01:16:26.708
I think I can help.

01:16:29.250 --> 01:16:31.623
Everything that happened tonight

01:16:31.625 --> 01:16:33.290
wasn't caused by some little boy

01:16:33.292 --> 01:16:35.915
that went missing 20 years ago.

01:16:35.917 --> 01:16:37.873
It was you!

01:16:37.875 --> 01:16:39.373
You're responsible
for everything.

01:16:42.417 --> 01:16:43.250
Sheriff.

01:16:46.292 --> 01:16:48.625
Can I see you for a minute?

01:17:00.542 --> 01:17:01.873
What is she doing here?

01:17:01.875 --> 01:17:03.415
I told her she needs to leave.

01:17:03.417 --> 01:17:05.708
But she won't stop with
this ghost story shit.

01:18:32.083 --> 01:18:34.250
What the hell just
happened here tonight?

01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:41.706
This is Glen Rossi with
KVCB Channel Five News

01:18:41.708 --> 01:18:45.123
reporting to you live from
Downtown Fall Creek Valley.

01:18:45.125 --> 01:18:46.998
We are interrupting
your regular programming

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.248
for a brief moment

01:18:48.250 --> 01:18:50.998
to report to you this
heartbreaking story.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.581
Perhaps the biggest tragedy

01:18:52.583 --> 01:18:54.581
in the history of
Fall Creek Valley.

01:18:54.583 --> 01:18:56.665
It is with a heavy
heart to report

01:18:56.667 --> 01:19:00.581
that the bodies of eight local
residents have been found

01:19:00.583 --> 01:19:02.750
at various locations
around town.

01:19:03.917 --> 01:19:05.415
Here to comment is
Sheriff Ryan Leavitt

01:19:05.417 --> 01:19:06.750
with more information.

01:19:08.083 --> 01:19:11.915
Sheriff, what can you
reveal about these murders?

01:19:11.917 --> 01:19:13.123
Well, Glen, at this time,

01:19:13.125 --> 01:19:15.417
all of the events
for the past 24 hours

01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:17.415
are under investigation.

01:19:17.417 --> 01:19:19.790
We have seven
separate crime scenes.

01:19:19.792 --> 01:19:21.248
One suspect.

01:19:21.250 --> 01:19:24.748
A Reggie Griffin was taken
into custody late last night.

01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:27.623
And you believe these murders
could possibly be linked?

01:19:27.625 --> 01:19:30.373
Well, we explored the
possibility of a connection

01:19:30.375 --> 01:19:32.665
between several of
the murder victims

01:19:32.667 --> 01:19:35.208
and the disappearance
of Bobby Maxwell.

01:19:36.833 --> 01:19:37.625
I see.

01:19:38.833 --> 01:19:41.123
And is the suspect
still in custody?

01:19:41.125 --> 01:19:46.125
Unfortunately,
Mr. Griffin died in custody

01:19:46.875 --> 01:19:47.667
early this morning.

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:51.331
How did he die so suddenly?

01:19:51.333 --> 01:19:53.248
That's under investigation.

01:19:53.250 --> 01:19:56.873
So you still have yet to
determine his cause of death?

01:19:56.875 --> 01:19:58.623
Glen, an autopsy is pending.

01:19:58.625 --> 01:20:00.248
Of course.

01:20:00.250 --> 01:20:01.498
So Sheriff, in conclusion,

01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:02.748
is there anything
you'd like to say

01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:05.248
to the residents of
Fall Creek Valley?

01:20:05.250 --> 01:20:08.498
To the citizens of Fall
Creek Valley, remain calm.

01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:10.581
We are confident we found
the person responsible

01:20:10.583 --> 01:20:12.123
for these horrible crimes.

01:20:12.125 --> 01:20:13.498
But remain vigilant.

01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:16.873
If you see anything suspicious
call 911 immediately.

01:20:16.875 --> 01:20:19.498
In essence, if you see
something, say something.

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:22.456
In memorium of the victims
of this terrible tragedy,

01:20:22.458 --> 01:20:24.331
there will be a candlelight
vigil held tonight

01:20:24.333 --> 01:20:27.915
at sunset at the Fall Creek
Valley Towne Center Hall.

01:20:27.917 --> 01:20:30.331
We will be bringing you
more updates and information

01:20:30.333 --> 01:20:32.123
as it becomes available.

01:20:32.125 --> 01:20:35.665
This night will
forever live in infamy

01:20:35.667 --> 01:20:38.500
as the night of the Fall
Creek Valley Massacre.

01:20:45.333 --> 01:20:46.873
Waaaooo!

01:20:46.875 --> 01:20:50.540
That was an amazing,
mind-altering Halloween night

01:20:50.542 --> 01:20:52.040
for the ages!

01:20:52.042 --> 01:20:54.373
The ghosts and ghouls
rocked the halls

01:20:54.375 --> 01:20:57.165
as the demons and witches
danced with the dead.

01:20:57.167 --> 01:21:01.040
Zombies and werewolves feasted
on the flesh of the innocent

01:21:01.042 --> 01:21:04.331
and the Harvest Moon
dripped with blood.

01:21:04.333 --> 01:21:07.081
20 years of throwing this party.

01:21:07.083 --> 01:21:10.040
And without patting myself on
the back too much, my freaks,

01:21:10.042 --> 01:21:12.958
I think yours truly
raised the bar yet again.

01:21:14.042 --> 01:21:16.040
It was one wild and crazy night.

01:21:16.042 --> 01:21:18.748
I got a call that my
twin brother is here.

01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:19.625
Reggie Griffin?

01:21:20.625 --> 01:21:22.206
Alex?

01:21:22.208 --> 01:21:23.748
Alex Griffin?

01:21:28.042 --> 01:21:29.415
Your nose is bleeding.

01:21:29.417 --> 01:21:30.998
Well, my Rockodiles,

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.790
don't fear the reaper just yet

01:21:32.792 --> 01:21:35.581
'cause even though
tonight's festivities

01:21:35.583 --> 01:21:37.123
have reached the end,

01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:39.248
there's always next year.

01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:42.165
Bloody Bobby!

01:21:42.167 --> 01:21:43.250
Bloody Bobby!

01:21:45.042 --> 01:21:46.083
Bloody Bobby!

01:21:47.583 --> 01:21:48.625
Bloody Bobby!

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.083
Bloody Bobby!

01:21:51.917 --> 01:21:53.000
Bloody Bobby!

01:21:55.125 --> 01:21:56.250
Bloody Bobby!

01:21:57.208 --> 01:21:58.250
Bloody Bobby!

01:21:59.875 --> 01:22:00.917
Bloody Bobby!

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:03.333
Bloody Bobby!
