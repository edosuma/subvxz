WEBVTT

00:02.024 --> 00:03.745
Previously on "Shut Eye"...

00:03.746 --> 00:06.588
I'm not looking for a sucker.
I'm looking for a partner.

00:06.589 --> 00:09.671
I've made some dubious
partnerships in my life.

00:09.672 --> 00:12.874
You have a singular talent,
Mr. Haverford.

00:12.875 --> 00:15.797
It is a shame you are
going to waste it here.

00:15.798 --> 00:19.521
You can disobey if you want to.

00:19.522 --> 00:22.604
Do the cards tell you how to do that?

00:23.257 --> 00:25.166
If only.

00:25.167 --> 00:30.051
I saw a girl. My vision of your baby...
you had a daughter.

00:30.052 --> 00:32.558
So one of us is wrong.

00:33.896 --> 00:35.577
How do you know it's him?

00:35.578 --> 00:37.859
Did you hear the shit that was
coming out of his mouth?

00:37.860 --> 00:40.141
Well, he's a paying tenant.

00:40.142 --> 00:41.783
He's a racist pig.

00:42.234 --> 00:44.786
I should go back in there
and rip his fucking head off.

00:44.787 --> 00:47.148
We're legit businessmen now.

00:47.149 --> 00:48.830
Are you sure?

00:48.831 --> 00:51.432
'Cause I could get rid
of this sick fuck real quick.

00:51.433 --> 00:53.955
I am not going to ask the Council

00:53.956 --> 00:57.158
to call a kris to consider his return.

00:57.159 --> 01:00.321
Grandma,
you said tradition is all we have.

01:00.322 --> 01:03.645
Is it tradition
that LaLa not have a father?

01:03.646 --> 01:04.726
That I don't?

01:04.727 --> 01:06.287
Why does it bother you so much

01:06.288 --> 01:08.489
that I've been spending time with Nora?

01:08.490 --> 01:10.532
To me, she'll always be Dr. White,

01:10.533 --> 01:12.373
so it's just a little weird.

01:12.374 --> 01:14.776
She's become my spiritual tune-up coach.

01:14.777 --> 01:16.257
He's dead.

01:16.258 --> 01:18.540
You fucked up.

01:18.541 --> 01:20.522
So did you.

01:21.383 --> 01:22.423
They're gone.

01:22.941 --> 01:24.318
Your vision things?

01:24.827 --> 01:27.228
I haven't had one in weeks.

01:28.280 --> 01:29.871
Hello?

01:32.915 --> 01:34.757
Hello?!

01:36.000 --> 01:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:45.487 --> 01:47.689
Damn, girl.

01:54.096 --> 01:56.417
Pick a card.
No way, Haverford.

01:56.418 --> 01:57.859
It's just for practice.

01:57.860 --> 01:59.981
Pick on someone who, uh,
doesn't know any better.

02:11.634 --> 02:13.114
Can I get you something?

02:13.115 --> 02:15.597
Yeah, whatever will kill me the fastest.

02:15.598 --> 02:17.599
Two Jacks on the rocks.

02:17.600 --> 02:20.802
Tennessee whiskey. I'll pass.

02:20.803 --> 02:22.203
I thought you wanted to choke on it.

02:22.204 --> 02:23.845
Uh, that'll do it.

02:23.846 --> 02:25.406
No, I can't take your money.

02:25.407 --> 02:26.888
You have no choice. Charlie Haverford.

02:26.889 --> 02:28.369
Charlie.

02:28.370 --> 02:30.251
Us Bulldogs have to
look out for one another,

02:30.252 --> 02:31.492
especially in enemy territory.

02:31.493 --> 02:33.134
Oh.

02:33.135 --> 02:34.856
Well, whereabouts are you from?

02:34.857 --> 02:37.619
Heard of Nevils?
It's just a pit stop on the road to...

02:37.620 --> 02:39.340
On the way to Savannah.

02:39.341 --> 02:41.903
Yes, sir, I believe I stopped
for gas there one time.

02:41.904 --> 02:43.184
Not much else to do there.

02:43.185 --> 02:44.786
Mm-hmm.

02:44.787 --> 02:47.028
You, uh...

02:47.029 --> 02:49.270
You lost your drawl.

02:49.271 --> 02:50.592
So did you.

02:50.593 --> 02:52.033
Got dragged out here as a kid.

02:52.034 --> 02:54.395
Can't remember much,
other than some stories.

02:54.396 --> 02:56.077
What are you doing out here?

02:56.078 --> 02:59.160
Oh, I'm looking for a girl.

03:00.402 --> 03:01.683
Aren't we all?

03:01.684 --> 03:03.044
Only I found mine.

03:05.327 --> 03:06.487
I'm gonna marry her.

03:06.488 --> 03:07.849
Uh-huh.

03:07.850 --> 03:09.010
I didn't get your name.

03:10.292 --> 03:12.974
Well, hello, sweetheart.

03:12.975 --> 03:14.696
I wasn't sure I had the right place

03:14.697 --> 03:18.179
till this shithead tried
to sell me your backstory.

03:18.180 --> 03:21.022
At least we know he listens to you.

03:27.269 --> 03:29.831
So, this is where you work.

03:29.832 --> 03:31.753
For another few weeks.

03:31.754 --> 03:34.356
Charlie and I are moving to California.

03:36.358 --> 03:38.160
What are you doing here?

03:38.681 --> 03:41.538
I came to surprise
you for your birthday.

03:42.244 --> 03:43.845
It was last week.

03:43.846 --> 03:45.446
The 16th.

03:45.447 --> 03:48.329
It's the 11th, like it's always been.

03:48.330 --> 03:50.756
Mama's was the 16th.

03:55.618 --> 03:57.387
Happy birthday.

03:58.380 --> 04:00.640
You dying?
Not yet.

04:01.023 --> 04:03.264
You need money?
You know, can't a daddy

04:03.265 --> 04:06.267
just look in on his little girl
every once in a while?

04:06.268 --> 04:09.311
I haven't seen you in six years.

04:10.633 --> 04:14.235
I travel for the work. You know that.

04:14.236 --> 04:17.159
More than anyone, I reckon.

04:20.161 --> 04:21.827
So...

04:22.484 --> 04:24.806
this fella of yours...

04:24.807 --> 04:28.089
Let me guess... he's a rat?

04:28.090 --> 04:30.652
Eats rats. He's a snake.

04:30.653 --> 04:33.374
He sized me up as soon as I walked in.

04:33.375 --> 04:35.416
I think it's the boots
that might've caught his eye.

04:35.417 --> 04:36.698
What do you think?

04:36.699 --> 04:38.780
They are nice.

04:38.781 --> 04:40.389
Alligator.

04:41.544 --> 04:43.505
Gators eat snakes.

04:43.506 --> 04:44.866
Don't they?

04:44.867 --> 04:46.561
Just say the word.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.872
No?

04:52.995 --> 04:56.446
I guess you better give that
back to him, then.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.825
Couldn't help yourself?

05:01.368 --> 05:03.161
Charlie's a good man.

05:04.206 --> 05:06.206
He's gonna make a great father.

05:07.289 --> 05:09.812
Not that you could
pick one out of a lineup.

05:11.614 --> 05:13.615
You're having a baby.

05:13.616 --> 05:15.778
Still early.

05:17.900 --> 05:19.420
Congratulations.

05:19.421 --> 05:20.982
You could say it like you mean it.

05:20.983 --> 05:22.584
Come on. You're pregnant.

05:22.585 --> 05:25.066
You're gonna get married.
You're changing cities.

05:25.067 --> 05:27.749
It's a lot. What do you want me to say?

05:27.750 --> 05:29.951
Yeah, you're right.

05:29.952 --> 05:33.114
Be strange for you to weigh in now,
wouldn't it?

05:33.115 --> 05:34.235
All right.

05:34.236 --> 05:36.820
You are so much like your mama.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.401
You know, the problem is,
you're like me, too,

05:40.402 --> 05:42.868
and I am sorry about that.

05:44.326 --> 05:46.688
I'm sorry that I taught you to think

05:46.689 --> 05:49.090
that you don't deserve better.

05:58.340 --> 06:00.343
Congratulations.

06:10.753 --> 06:13.315
Your mama wanted you to have that.

06:15.437 --> 06:18.079
And I reckon you both earned it.

06:40.543 --> 06:43.064
I love you, peanut.

07:50.072 --> 07:51.673
You liking the slim cut?

07:51.674 --> 07:55.116
Since I'm neither a cowboy
or a '70s porn star,

07:55.117 --> 07:57.398
I have to ask. Corduroy?

07:57.399 --> 07:59.481
Corduroy's a classic material.

07:59.482 --> 08:01.403
Classics never go out of style.

08:01.404 --> 08:03.525
I think you look fantastic.

08:03.526 --> 08:06.768
Or should I say magnificent?

08:06.769 --> 08:08.810
I regret sharing my stage name with you.

08:08.811 --> 08:10.091
I think it's cute.

08:10.092 --> 08:12.053
I did, too, when I was 10.

08:12.054 --> 08:14.496
You knew you were destined
for greatness even back then.

08:14.497 --> 08:15.897
I think that's telling.

08:15.898 --> 08:18.179
Take this in.
We're not using the name.

08:18.180 --> 08:20.542
Oh, God, no. You're Charlie Haverford.

08:20.543 --> 08:22.504
We wouldn't sell you any other way.

08:22.505 --> 08:25.106
You're an ordinary man
with an extraordinary gift.

08:25.107 --> 08:26.828
Gift, right.

08:26.829 --> 08:30.752
I think we should play up the accident.

08:30.753 --> 08:34.155
The visions appeared
as a result of severe trauma.

08:34.155 --> 08:36.077
I got the shit kicked out of me.

08:36.078 --> 08:38.119
Maybe we leave that part out.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.842
Or maybe...
or maybe it makes you more relatable.

08:41.296 --> 08:43.048
Let's see the gabardine.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.567
I don't want you sweating
through your suit.

08:45.568 --> 08:48.249
Although that may help suggest

08:48.250 --> 08:50.171
that the visions are more taxing.

08:50.172 --> 08:53.014
It could offer a way out
if something goes wrong,

08:53.015 --> 08:56.297
give you a break from time to time.

08:56.663 --> 08:57.819
Do you even need me here?

08:57.820 --> 09:00.622
What do you think? Your opinion matters.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.341
I think she's talking to you.

09:05.708 --> 09:07.549
We'll start off in a small venue,

09:07.550 --> 09:09.711
try out a couple of
different approaches,

09:09.712 --> 09:11.433
see what you're comfortable with.

09:11.434 --> 09:14.235
Of course,
the visions are the real "X" factor.

09:14.236 --> 09:16.918
If we hit the ground running,
the sky is the limit.

09:16.919 --> 09:19.161
Glasses.

09:20.963 --> 09:23.765
I think glasses.

09:23.766 --> 09:25.039
They're gone.

09:26.689 --> 09:27.898
What?

09:29.011 --> 09:30.692
My visions.

09:30.693 --> 09:33.495
They're gone.
I haven't had one in a month.

09:33.496 --> 09:36.080
It's happened before
but never this long.

09:37.860 --> 09:39.981
Well, that's a relief.

09:39.982 --> 09:42.094
I hope they stay gone.

09:42.945 --> 09:44.507
What?

09:46.709 --> 09:48.229
What?

09:48.230 --> 09:49.551
Are you hearing me?

09:49.552 --> 09:51.993
I heard you just fine.

09:51.994 --> 09:54.315
You think the visions make you special.

09:54.316 --> 09:55.637
I don't.

09:55.638 --> 09:57.118
Hell, up until a couple of minutes ago,

09:57.119 --> 09:58.760
I thought you were
making the whole thing up.

09:58.761 --> 10:01.242
But you believe Paz can
communicate with the universe?

10:01.243 --> 10:03.405
I said I support his claims.

10:03.406 --> 10:04.886
It's a minor distinction.

10:04.887 --> 10:06.367
It's a big distinction.

10:06.368 --> 10:08.730
Paz thinks he's
communing with the universe,

10:08.731 --> 10:10.532
he is communing with the universe.

10:10.533 --> 10:12.774
To me, your visions are a wild card,

10:12.775 --> 10:14.736
and wild cards scare me.

10:14.737 --> 10:17.979
I like to know what I am dealing with.

10:17.980 --> 10:21.623
Listen, I didn't pursue you
because you can see things.

10:21.624 --> 10:24.666
I pursued you because you have talent.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.307
You can cold read with the best of them.

10:26.308 --> 10:29.270
You are smart, you are capable,
and you are...

10:29.271 --> 10:30.947
And I'm in on the con.

10:31.554 --> 10:34.659
Which makes my life much easier.

10:35.368 --> 10:36.958
Let's make a deal.

10:36.959 --> 10:39.040
And if one of us
doesn't hold up our end,

10:39.041 --> 10:41.723
the other one can walk away
from this thing at any time.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.204
I'm listening.

10:43.205 --> 10:44.926
Funny.

10:44.927 --> 10:46.546
The deal is this.

10:47.209 --> 10:50.812
We do not con each other.

10:50.813 --> 10:52.775
Ever.

10:54.777 --> 10:56.779
Sound good?

10:58.581 --> 11:00.101
Great.

11:00.102 --> 11:02.625
Let's go.

11:04.346 --> 11:07.348
I just...
I have this crazy, irresistible urge

11:07.349 --> 11:09.230
to just buy one of everything.

11:09.231 --> 11:10.672
I mean, is that normal?

11:10.673 --> 11:12.794
Always look at the price tags.

11:12.795 --> 11:16.558
They tend to make
things more resistible.

11:16.559 --> 11:18.279
Sweet baby Jesus.

11:18.280 --> 11:20.562
Yeah, well, he couldn't afford
anything in this place.

11:20.563 --> 11:23.645
Ugh. So, tell me what to do,
like, talk me out of this.

11:23.646 --> 11:25.687
I mean, tell me what I really need.

11:25.688 --> 11:28.810
Diapers, boobs, a safe place to sleep.

11:28.811 --> 11:30.331
Just complete your registry,

11:30.332 --> 11:33.655
then buy what's left after the shower.

11:33.656 --> 11:36.137
Sho... I don't know about a shower.
Did you have a shower?

11:36.138 --> 11:39.100
The girls I worked
with threw me a shower

11:39.101 --> 11:40.892
when I was pregnant with Nick.

11:42.024 --> 11:44.265
My boss wouldn't let us have it inside,

11:44.266 --> 11:48.309
so they dragged tables
out to the parking lot.

11:48.817 --> 11:51.993
Not exactly what guys are looking for

11:51.994 --> 11:54.280
when they walk into a strip club.

11:56.879 --> 12:00.121
Come on. You're leaving me in suspense.

12:00.122 --> 12:02.283
What did the ultrasound say?

12:02.284 --> 12:05.126
Oh, no.
I told my OB that I didn't want to know.

12:05.127 --> 12:09.411
But the girls at my office,
they want to throw me a, um...

12:09.412 --> 12:12.013
What is it called?
A gender reveal party?

12:12.465 --> 12:14.536
I've heard about those.
Mm.

12:14.537 --> 12:16.898
They didn't have that
when I was pregnant with Nick.

12:16.899 --> 12:18.620
Sounds fun.
Really? You think so?

12:18.621 --> 12:20.822
I mean, it just sounds like
millennial nonsense to me.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.343
They want to do it Friday night.

12:22.344 --> 12:23.465
Where?
At the office.

12:23.466 --> 12:25.628
No way. It's a terrible idea.

12:28.431 --> 12:31.553
Save the stale hospital smell
for the delivery room.

12:31.554 --> 12:34.075
You are gonna have it at our place.

12:34.076 --> 12:36.478
Oh, come on, no.
I can't let you do that.

12:36.479 --> 12:38.039
I insist.

12:38.040 --> 12:39.641
It's the least that we can do

12:39.642 --> 12:41.643
after all the help
you've been to Charlie and me.

12:41.644 --> 12:43.805
Where's the ultrasound?

12:43.806 --> 12:47.809
It's at my house in a sealed envelope.

12:47.810 --> 12:49.130
That's perfect.

12:49.131 --> 12:50.412
You bring it to the party,

12:50.413 --> 12:53.334
and we surprise everyone... even you.

12:53.335 --> 12:55.096
Eh.

12:55.097 --> 12:57.138
Well, Charlie said it was a girl.

12:57.139 --> 12:59.260
Paz said it was a boy.

12:59.261 --> 13:01.302
Maybe they're both right.

13:01.303 --> 13:04.787
Maybe this is just your first.

13:07.430 --> 13:09.591
I was standing there for like 10 minutes

13:09.592 --> 13:12.033
trying to time it so it wouldn't
wash out too soon,

13:12.034 --> 13:13.394
just waiting for Simza to burst in.

13:13.395 --> 13:15.196
So she believed it.
Mm-hmm.

13:15.197 --> 13:17.405
That's fuckin' brilliant.

13:18.601 --> 13:21.002
I should've taken lessons
from you instead of my aunt,

13:21.003 --> 13:24.966
because the last scam that
I tried blew up in my face.

13:24.967 --> 13:27.689
This wasn't a scam. It was self-defense.

13:27.690 --> 13:29.330
What about Little Tony?

13:29.331 --> 13:32.293
Is, um...
Isn't he going to figure it out?

13:32.294 --> 13:35.096
Yeah, so, the next morning,
he asked me what happened.

13:35.097 --> 13:37.298
Didn't remember a thing.

13:37.299 --> 13:40.762
So I told him I saved his ass.

13:41.596 --> 13:43.344
I told him he couldn't get it up.

13:43.345 --> 13:44.546
Yeah.

13:44.547 --> 13:46.227
It worked.

13:46.228 --> 13:48.591
He was so embarrassed,
he hasn't asked for it since.

13:52.190 --> 13:54.035
What? What?

13:54.036 --> 13:56.798
It's just some stupid
thing going around.

13:56.799 --> 13:58.761
Oh, my God.

14:01.163 --> 14:04.744
Nothing personal, your school sucks.

14:05.608 --> 14:07.747
Believe me, I know.

14:09.011 --> 14:11.573
They're just rumors, all right?

14:11.574 --> 14:14.216
Look, they don't...
they don't know anything.

14:16.098 --> 14:18.059
May not know anything now,

14:18.060 --> 14:20.176
but I'm sure they'd
find out soon enough.

14:21.302 --> 14:23.865
Bet Little Tony's telling everyone.

14:24.263 --> 14:26.265
You should fight fire with fire.

14:26.869 --> 14:29.270
How?
Take charge of the rumors.

14:29.271 --> 14:31.593
Give them something else to talk about.

14:31.896 --> 14:32.939
Hm.

14:37.694 --> 14:40.403
Scoot over.

14:46.409 --> 14:47.870
Smile.

14:48.451 --> 14:50.371
Oh, come on. Fire with fire, right?

14:50.372 --> 14:52.294
Fire with fire.

15:19.736 --> 15:21.843
What'd you find on our guy?

15:21.844 --> 15:23.525
Not much paperwork around.

15:23.526 --> 15:25.487
I mean, no timecards or anything.

15:25.488 --> 15:27.969
He didn't have any employees.
It was just him.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.571
Family?

15:29.572 --> 15:31.413
I didn't find any photos.

15:31.414 --> 15:35.417
I sent my cousin to check his
address on his driver's license.

15:35.418 --> 15:36.961
He lives alone.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.756
No one to miss him.

15:40.543 --> 15:43.144
What about this junk? Worth anything?

15:43.145 --> 15:44.626
I just started going through it,

15:44.627 --> 15:48.910
but I found something
that might be nothing.

15:48.911 --> 15:50.553
Come here.

15:53.596 --> 15:57.440
5 bucks says it's LaserDisc players.

15:59.962 --> 16:01.603
Fuck me.

16:01.604 --> 16:04.030
This shit is military-grade.

16:04.927 --> 16:08.010
We killed a fuckin' gun-runner.

16:10.212 --> 16:12.214
I owe you 5 bucks.

16:18.421 --> 16:21.343
Ah, fuckin' hell.

17:02.344 --> 17:04.226
Ma.

17:05.307 --> 17:07.829
Is this how you live?

17:07.829 --> 17:11.638
A pig sty is more orderly.

17:12.555 --> 17:14.267
Something to drink?

17:15.998 --> 17:20.563
I got water and, uh... uh, water.

17:23.646 --> 17:25.246
Oh.

17:25.247 --> 17:27.167
No, thanks.

17:27.169 --> 17:29.811
So you got my message?

17:29.812 --> 17:33.615
Your request for a kris...
that's a lot to ask.

17:33.616 --> 17:35.136
I know.

17:35.137 --> 17:38.339
But I've been working really hard...
on myself.

17:38.340 --> 17:40.181
Oh, please.

17:40.182 --> 17:42.424
It has been two months
since you have been banished.

17:42.425 --> 17:45.667
Don't try to convince me
you're a different person.

17:45.668 --> 17:48.029
But I've been doing
a lot of reflection since then.

17:48.030 --> 17:50.071
I don't care what you've been doing

17:50.072 --> 17:51.833
or what you think you deserve.

17:51.834 --> 17:53.354
Jesus, Ma, I'm sorry.

17:53.355 --> 17:56.799
Am I allowed to say my piece, hmm?

17:59.562 --> 18:06.007
Simza and I are aware of your
appeals to rejoin the family.

18:06.008 --> 18:08.279
We are considering them.

18:08.731 --> 18:10.892
But there are conditions.

18:10.893 --> 18:13.868
And restitution to be paid.

18:14.977 --> 18:16.578
I'll pay everyone.

18:16.579 --> 18:18.299
Whatever it takes.

18:18.300 --> 18:21.000
I just want to spend time with my kids.

18:21.751 --> 18:23.745
How touching.

18:23.961 --> 18:25.867
Because of your action,

18:26.172 --> 18:29.270
the Marks family no longer exists.

18:29.271 --> 18:31.886
We are Rankos now.

18:32.515 --> 18:36.117
And if you're allowed to return,

18:36.118 --> 18:38.561
you will be one, too.

18:41.764 --> 18:42.884
I understand.

18:42.885 --> 18:44.440
Do you?

18:45.327 --> 18:49.250
It means you'd no longer
be the head of the household.

18:49.251 --> 18:52.494
That falls on White Tony's eldest.

18:52.495 --> 18:55.056
Your son-in-law.

18:55.057 --> 18:56.297
He's just a kid.

18:56.298 --> 18:59.060
Who was elevated by your own hands,

18:59.061 --> 19:02.505
and now you have to abide by his rules.

19:06.268 --> 19:12.113
Then, I'll reach out to Josip
and make a formal request.

19:12.114 --> 19:14.303
In the meantime...

19:15.718 --> 19:18.520
do something about this.

19:18.521 --> 19:21.060
It's an embarrassment.

19:25.408 --> 19:29.451
Why the fuck did I volunteer to do this?

19:29.452 --> 19:31.693
Because this is what normal people do...

19:31.694 --> 19:33.294
and someone decided to try

19:33.295 --> 19:35.978
doing normal for a while.

19:41.223 --> 19:42.864
What a surprise.

19:42.865 --> 19:45.787
I got an e-mail about
the party changing locations.

19:45.788 --> 19:47.909
Now, I know you're not one to ask.

19:47.910 --> 19:49.471
We learnt that at the retreat.

19:49.472 --> 19:51.593
But since Charlie's away practicing,

19:51.594 --> 19:53.715
I thought you could do with a hand.

19:53.716 --> 19:56.438
This one's for us, but I bought more.

19:56.439 --> 19:59.200
Snacks and party favors.

19:59.201 --> 20:00.683
Get in here.

20:07.810 --> 20:10.211
Charlie tells me you two have a son.

20:10.212 --> 20:13.334
Nick. He's 15.

20:13.335 --> 20:14.696
He'll be 16 in a few weeks.

20:14.697 --> 20:16.377
I have no idea how that happened.

20:16.378 --> 20:17.825
Oof.

20:18.380 --> 20:20.494
What about you?

20:21.464 --> 20:23.545
Oh, no kids.

20:23.546 --> 20:26.868
They didn't fit with the plan.

20:26.869 --> 20:28.544
You were married.

20:29.151 --> 20:31.380
Twice. That obvious?

20:31.754 --> 20:34.316
Tan line on your ring finger.

20:35.157 --> 20:37.118
The last one finished six months ago.

20:37.119 --> 20:39.238
He ended it this time.

20:40.483 --> 20:43.164
You were married to the same guy twice?

20:43.165 --> 20:45.447
I'm not one to give up on a good thing.

20:45.448 --> 20:47.969
Or a bad one, apparently.

20:47.970 --> 20:49.771
I still haven't signed the papers.

20:49.772 --> 20:52.293
Who knows. Stranger things, right?

20:52.696 --> 20:54.153
What should I do with this?

20:55.363 --> 20:56.906
I'll trade you.

21:03.426 --> 21:05.915
You said Charlie was practicing.

21:06.989 --> 21:10.632
Well, he's used to reacting
to people in front of him,

21:10.633 --> 21:12.073
one-on-one.

21:12.074 --> 21:14.956
Now he has to stand and deliver.

21:15.383 --> 21:16.397
Speechify.

21:16.398 --> 21:18.079
Mm, essentially, yes,

21:18.080 --> 21:22.684
but more important than the words is...
believing them.

21:22.685 --> 21:25.226
He needs to prove he means what he says.

21:26.168 --> 21:28.396
You think we're scam artists.

21:29.572 --> 21:32.053
I think your clients
get something from you,

21:32.054 --> 21:34.776
like you did when
you came to the retreat.

21:34.777 --> 21:38.179
It's not for any of us
to judge how people heal.

21:38.180 --> 21:40.982
Tell that to Charlie.
He thinks Paz is full of shit.

21:40.983 --> 21:43.994
I'm worried people will feel
the same about Charlie.

21:44.707 --> 21:47.549
When he speaks, if... if there is even

21:47.550 --> 21:49.591
the slightest hint of inauthenticity,

21:49.592 --> 21:51.873
he will be chased out of the room.

21:52.294 --> 21:53.875
He needs to be a man of faith.

21:54.213 --> 21:55.757
What do you have him doing?

21:56.006 --> 21:57.925
I gave him some homework.

21:59.135 --> 22:01.242
Told him to write me a sermon.

22:01.554 --> 22:02.764
This better be important.

22:02.765 --> 22:04.846
I have two more appointments,
both referrals.

22:04.847 --> 22:06.047
I may never get them back.

22:06.048 --> 22:07.929
Sorry. I got to close up early.

22:07.930 --> 22:09.891
I will make it up to you.

22:09.892 --> 22:11.853
I want a Saturday.

22:11.854 --> 22:13.335
No.

22:15.609 --> 22:18.500
I'll give you a Sunday,
but I pick which one.

22:18.501 --> 22:19.941
Fair.

22:19.942 --> 22:21.222
New glasses?

22:21.490 --> 22:23.384
Yeah. Yeah. What do you think?

22:23.385 --> 22:24.906
It doesn't matter what I think.

22:25.419 --> 22:27.149
But the spirits think
you're trying too hard.

22:51.894 --> 22:54.577
Sorry about the barbecue.
It wasn't my idea.

22:57.540 --> 22:59.140
Silent treatment.

22:59.141 --> 23:02.063
So, yeah, you're gonna
suffer through this with me.

23:02.064 --> 23:03.908
It's the least you can do.

23:06.452 --> 23:09.350
"We look not at the things
which are seen but at the things

23:09.351 --> 23:12.353
which are not seen, for all the things

23:12.354 --> 23:14.355
which are seen are temporal,

23:14.356 --> 23:17.599
but the things which
are not seen are eternal."

23:18.130 --> 23:19.200
Hear that?

23:19.201 --> 23:21.383
Your body's eternal.

23:22.445 --> 23:25.887
"Simplicity without a name
is free from all external aim,

23:25.888 --> 23:28.129
with no desire at rest and still.

23:28.130 --> 23:30.692
All things go right as of their will."

23:30.693 --> 23:34.563
"1 fish, 2 fish, red fish, blue fish."

23:35.337 --> 23:37.178
Come on. That was funny.

23:37.179 --> 23:40.142
This can't be that hard.

23:50.873 --> 23:52.474
When...

23:52.475 --> 23:54.196
No.

24:09.532 --> 24:11.414
Nope.

24:14.056 --> 24:15.229
Shut up.

24:30.553 --> 24:33.516
Little Tony.
Good to see you.

24:37.960 --> 24:40.722
Do I detect the glow of new life here?

24:40.723 --> 24:44.165
We could only be so lucky so soon.

24:44.166 --> 24:46.287
Please, come inside.

24:46.288 --> 24:47.636
Thank you.

25:03.826 --> 25:05.787
Given the way this union came together,

25:05.788 --> 25:07.909
I'm very pleased
with how it's worked out.

25:07.910 --> 25:10.832
They have marvelous chemistry.
Don't you think?

25:10.833 --> 25:12.914
Oh, I agree. I totally agree.

25:12.915 --> 25:14.716
And how's your family?

25:14.717 --> 25:17.158
I hope all is well,
because I hear your grandson

25:17.159 --> 25:18.760
is recovering from surgery.

25:18.761 --> 25:20.281
Appendicitis, yeah.

25:20.282 --> 25:21.923
Oh.

25:21.924 --> 25:25.549
I know how hard it is
when a child is sick.

25:26.449 --> 25:29.691
And we sometimes wonder how...

25:29.692 --> 25:32.053
how we do with so many under the roof.

25:32.054 --> 25:35.517
Yeah, most days,
I don't know how we manage, honestly.

25:36.435 --> 25:38.179
This is why I'm here.

25:38.180 --> 25:40.782
You want, uh, additional assistance.

25:40.783 --> 25:43.465
We have cut back,
and Little Tony has done

25:43.466 --> 25:46.748
a wonderful job with the finances,
right?

25:46.749 --> 25:52.634
But he is not yet of age
to contribute to the household.

25:52.635 --> 25:54.275
What are you asking for?

25:54.276 --> 25:57.559
We think it's time to bring someone in,

25:57.560 --> 26:00.201
someone who knows both families.

26:00.202 --> 26:01.377
Mm-hmm.

26:02.169 --> 26:04.125
I could arrange to
spend a little more time here,

26:04.126 --> 26:05.607
if you'd like.
Oh.

26:05.608 --> 26:07.809
Oh, you're such a good friend.

26:07.810 --> 26:11.694
But we want somebody closer to home.

26:15.738 --> 26:18.602
You want the Council to restore Fonso?

26:19.822 --> 26:24.225
We want a kris to take this
request into consideration.

26:24.226 --> 26:25.547
Mm-hmm.
Yes.

26:25.548 --> 26:27.749
Yes, this is what we want.

26:27.750 --> 26:31.573
And this request has your full support?

26:32.658 --> 26:37.078
There has been enough
bad blood between our families.

26:37.079 --> 26:40.958
And now with this beautiful union,
it's...

26:41.564 --> 26:43.627
it's time to put that to rest.

26:44.670 --> 26:46.287
For good.

26:46.630 --> 26:49.531
And what guarantee do we have?
That he'll toe the line?

26:49.532 --> 26:53.535
Even I am totally surprised
by the man he has become.

26:53.536 --> 26:59.060
Being separated from his
children changed him profoundly.

26:59.061 --> 27:00.728
Mm.

27:09.079 --> 27:11.673
I see you've got your claws
in her nice and deep.

27:11.674 --> 27:13.515
I'm only surprised it took this long.

27:13.516 --> 27:17.639
Oh, Simza is perfectly capable
of making her own decisions.

27:17.640 --> 27:20.562
In fact, this has been
quite a struggle between us.

27:20.563 --> 27:23.965
But this is one of
the few times we agree.

27:23.966 --> 27:27.769
Rita, I'm not Tibor, and I'm not Fonso,

27:27.770 --> 27:31.372
and you can't play me
like every man in your life.

27:31.508 --> 27:34.175
Family comes first.

27:34.176 --> 27:38.019
This I always believed, as you did once.

27:38.020 --> 27:40.181
I hope you remember.

27:40.182 --> 27:45.066
But if this is beyond you,
let me use terms you do understand.

27:45.439 --> 27:48.229
Power and money.

27:48.442 --> 27:51.433
Right now, we're hemorrhaging both.

27:51.653 --> 27:55.877
And you know as well as I do
what Fonso brings to the table.

27:55.878 --> 27:57.919
I can call a kris.

27:57.920 --> 28:00.562
I can't guarantee you'll
have the support you need.

28:00.563 --> 28:03.124
You all have to be there
to defend yourself...

28:03.125 --> 28:07.769
you, Little Tony, Simza, and Fonso.

28:07.770 --> 28:09.931
Understood.

28:37.199 --> 28:39.000
Ooh.

28:39.001 --> 28:40.642
Scandalous.

28:40.643 --> 28:42.043
I'm my own man.

28:42.044 --> 28:43.645
Mm-hmm.

28:43.646 --> 28:45.807
Yeah, I've been lucky.
Aside from a little bit

28:45.808 --> 28:47.689
of morning sickness, I've been great.

28:47.690 --> 28:49.851
Oh. Wait till the baby
elbows you in the kidneys.

28:49.852 --> 28:51.653
That's when the real fun starts.

28:51.654 --> 28:54.536
Honestly, I can't wait for that.
Hey.

28:54.537 --> 28:56.818
Here you go.
Oh. Thank you.

28:56.819 --> 28:58.660
Would you like one? Cider.

28:58.661 --> 29:00.347
Thank you.

29:01.937 --> 29:03.625
Ah. I'll be right back.

29:03.626 --> 29:04.970
Yeah.

29:09.672 --> 29:12.954
Didn't expect to see you.
I thought you were on walkabout.

29:12.955 --> 29:15.877
Come on. And miss this? Hmm?

29:15.878 --> 29:17.959
Enlightenment can wait.

29:17.960 --> 29:21.403
So, I bet that you never envisioned,

29:21.404 --> 29:24.446
when we first met, that I would
be back in this house again,

29:24.447 --> 29:25.967
let alone an invited guest.

29:25.968 --> 29:27.809
Clearly, I'm not a very good psychic.

29:27.810 --> 29:29.050
You don't need to have superpowers

29:29.051 --> 29:30.692
to help people, Charlie.

29:30.693 --> 29:33.374
I'm glad that you are
finally understanding that.

29:33.375 --> 29:36.177
Maggie told you about our
little venture, did she?

29:36.178 --> 29:39.381
Yeah.
I'm happy for you, and I'm glad for her.

29:42.055 --> 29:43.849
Besides, I think she was getting...

29:44.427 --> 29:47.348
a little creatively stifled with me.

29:47.349 --> 29:50.272
She's a bit of a ball-buster,
that one, isn't she?

29:51.914 --> 29:54.556
Well,
just keep your priorities straight.

29:54.557 --> 29:55.717
You'll be fine.

29:58.572 --> 30:00.201
Okay.

30:00.741 --> 30:02.564
It is time, everyone.

30:02.565 --> 30:04.045
Ooh!

30:07.249 --> 30:10.492
Thank you.
No, I am not the magician in the family,

30:10.493 --> 30:13.054
but I still know a trick or two.

30:13.055 --> 30:16.297
As you can see,
this is a typical balloon,

30:16.298 --> 30:19.421
filled with hot air
like the men in our lives.

30:21.303 --> 30:24.786
Now, Nora, it is not time
for your epidural just yet,

30:24.787 --> 30:27.709
but what do you say we answer
the question of the day?

30:28.644 --> 30:30.031
If you would, please, do the honors.

30:30.032 --> 30:31.272
Ooh.

30:33.476 --> 30:35.597
It's a girl!

30:35.598 --> 30:38.480
That was amazing!

30:38.481 --> 30:40.281
Well, that's odd.

30:40.282 --> 30:43.285
I could've sworn you said it was a boy.

30:47.788 --> 30:48.890
Cake.

30:49.081 --> 30:50.612
Thank you.

30:50.916 --> 30:52.534
How's the sermon coming?

30:52.793 --> 30:55.045
It's really coming along well.

30:56.378 --> 30:58.540
I can't wait to hear it.

30:58.541 --> 31:01.760
Can I have everyone's attention, please?

31:02.545 --> 31:04.666
I would like to extend a blessing

31:04.667 --> 31:06.682
to my dear friend Nora.

31:07.516 --> 31:12.073
May the joy that you feel
in your heart right now

31:12.074 --> 31:18.279
extend through your life into
the life of your firstborn.

31:18.280 --> 31:21.322
And I hope you know
that whenever you need me,

31:21.323 --> 31:24.783
wherever you need me, I will be there.

31:26.288 --> 31:28.570
I may not be as good as a baby monitor,

31:28.829 --> 31:30.251
but I'll be listening.

31:30.252 --> 31:32.333
Aww.
Thank you.

31:32.334 --> 31:34.416
That's beautiful.

31:34.417 --> 31:35.857
Charlie...
Hmm?

31:35.858 --> 31:38.099
isn't there something you wanted to say?

31:38.100 --> 31:39.340
Huh?

31:39.341 --> 31:41.341
Something about raising a daughter.

31:41.824 --> 31:43.427
It's really moving.

31:45.147 --> 31:46.346
Yeah.

31:52.394 --> 31:53.995
Girls are amazing.

31:54.877 --> 31:58.692
And sweet and complicated.

31:59.321 --> 32:02.844
And they are much stronger than boys.

32:03.280 --> 32:05.567
Probably because girls
mature faster than boys,

32:05.568 --> 32:06.888
and boys are slow.

32:06.889 --> 32:08.890
Not "slow," but slower.

32:08.891 --> 32:11.172
Not to prove your point for you, honey,

32:11.173 --> 32:14.135
but it is time to open gifts.

32:14.136 --> 32:16.698
So why don't you shut it
so we can have some fun?

32:18.981 --> 32:20.261
Yeah!

32:20.262 --> 32:21.984
Have a seat, sweetheart.
Thank you.

32:33.676 --> 32:35.479
Who are you texting?

32:36.278 --> 32:38.440
Friend from school.

32:38.857 --> 32:40.525
I thought you hated it there.

32:51.454 --> 32:53.735
Hey, can we talk?

32:54.039 --> 32:55.577
Like a real conversation?

32:55.578 --> 32:57.125
About serious stuff?

32:59.503 --> 33:01.103
What?

33:03.305 --> 33:05.425
I think we should try again.

33:06.718 --> 33:09.471
The thing that we tried
to do the first night...

33:09.472 --> 33:10.712
that I messed up and...

33:10.713 --> 33:12.874
Stop. I get it.

33:12.875 --> 33:14.636
It's just that I've been practicing,
and...

33:14.637 --> 33:15.997
Oh, my God.

33:15.998 --> 33:17.639
Gross.

33:17.640 --> 33:19.160
I'm not gonna let you down this time.

33:19.161 --> 33:22.003
I can't do this right now, okay?

33:22.004 --> 33:23.565
I've got a test tomorrow.

33:23.902 --> 33:25.487
I'm gonna study downstairs.

33:25.488 --> 33:26.988
Don't wait up.

33:56.799 --> 33:58.520
Fuck.

33:59.442 --> 34:02.163
It's literally hours of this.

34:02.164 --> 34:04.406
Sometimes someone will come in,

34:04.407 --> 34:07.969
they'll look around,
and then they leave.

34:07.970 --> 34:10.210
Watch this.

34:25.788 --> 34:28.309
No one buys anything.

34:28.310 --> 34:30.385
And neither does he.

34:30.833 --> 34:33.393
Then the entire fuckin' shop's a front.

34:33.395 --> 34:35.389
That's my guess.

34:41.163 --> 34:43.606
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop.

34:46.409 --> 34:48.027
Go back.

34:49.170 --> 34:51.172
Here. Play it.

35:06.789 --> 35:08.029
Could be our guy.

35:28.411 --> 35:30.211
Play it cool.

35:30.212 --> 35:32.415
You play it cool.

35:42.665 --> 35:44.626
Where's Caygeon?

35:44.627 --> 35:46.753
I'm afraid he's out of commission.

35:48.190 --> 35:49.831
What happened to him?

35:49.832 --> 35:51.716
Trust issues.

35:52.875 --> 35:54.886
I'm sure you could understand that.

36:25.307 --> 36:26.918
What?

36:37.560 --> 36:40.201
Looks good.

36:40.202 --> 36:42.726
Mind me asking where you acquired these?

36:46.688 --> 36:49.274
50 down, 100 on delivery.

36:55.698 --> 36:57.154
How much?

37:03.034 --> 37:04.706
50 down,

37:04.707 --> 37:07.670
125 on delivery.

37:20.483 --> 37:21.765
Hm.

37:26.978 --> 37:28.813
A sign of good faith?

37:29.522 --> 37:31.814
Always wanted to learn.

37:34.277 --> 37:36.698
I think we can make that happen.

37:47.590 --> 37:50.351
There's no right way
to forgive yourself.

37:50.352 --> 37:52.874
There's no magical cure.

37:53.171 --> 37:57.279
Like everything in life,
you just have to work at it.

37:59.161 --> 38:01.563
Time heals all wounds.

38:01.564 --> 38:04.686
If you ask me,
that's some bullshit right there.

38:07.410 --> 38:11.453
You don't feel better
because time has passed.

38:11.454 --> 38:15.617
You feel better because
you've processed it.

38:15.618 --> 38:20.061
Every emotion, every detail,
you put it to bed.

38:20.062 --> 38:22.263
You've put in the work.

38:22.700 --> 38:25.995
Blonde woman, second row to your right.

38:27.205 --> 38:29.872
You're putting in the work right now,
aren't you?

38:33.336 --> 38:35.797
Car accident, two years ago.

38:36.398 --> 38:38.199
She was driving.

38:38.200 --> 38:40.281
Looks like she was at fault.

38:40.282 --> 38:42.220
There were injuries.

38:43.566 --> 38:47.729
You're reacting to us.
You need to react to them.

38:48.059 --> 38:52.935
You blame yourself for the accident.

38:58.380 --> 39:00.196
You were driving.

39:01.944 --> 39:05.226
She may have lost her son.

39:05.227 --> 39:07.469
I'm not sure if it's related.

39:07.470 --> 39:09.751
Getting more details.

39:09.752 --> 39:12.233
You can't, uh...
You can't forgive yourself.

39:12.234 --> 39:14.315
Can't find any birth record...

39:18.841 --> 39:20.091
Whe...

39:21.509 --> 39:23.344
Hey, hey.

39:23.966 --> 39:26.287
It's okay. It's okay.

39:26.598 --> 39:28.249
You're in a safe place.

39:28.250 --> 39:30.292
We're all with you here.

39:33.146 --> 39:34.606
Your son...

39:35.857 --> 39:37.939
what was his name?

39:38.234 --> 39:39.941
Christopher.

39:41.784 --> 39:43.948
How far along were you?

39:46.159 --> 39:48.550
Five months.

39:55.317 --> 39:58.440
Christopher wants you to know
that he doesn't blame you.

40:00.723 --> 40:04.325
And he doesn't want you
to blame yourself, either.

40:04.326 --> 40:06.846
Oh, damn.

40:07.490 --> 40:09.432
Wow.

40:11.974 --> 40:14.576
What was that? What the fuck went wrong?

40:14.577 --> 40:16.898
Nothing, far as I could see.

40:16.899 --> 40:18.900
Nothing? No. I-I got lucky.

40:18.901 --> 40:20.462
That could've been a disaster.

40:20.463 --> 40:22.103
But it wasn't.

40:22.104 --> 40:25.031
Because you are exactly
the pro I thought you'd be.

40:26.108 --> 40:27.992
Oh.

40:29.410 --> 40:32.313
You messed with the equipment
on purpose, didn't you?

40:32.314 --> 40:35.597
You needed to see for yourself
what you are capable of.

40:35.598 --> 40:38.480
There aren't any tea leaves
or tarot cards back here.

40:38.481 --> 40:40.762
This is just you and them.

40:40.763 --> 40:42.924
You pulled this shit with Paz, too?

40:42.925 --> 40:46.247
Paz is successful because
he believes in himself.

40:46.248 --> 40:47.929
He's delusional.

40:47.930 --> 40:51.307
Maybe. But he isn't afraid.

40:52.054 --> 40:53.560
But I am?

40:54.417 --> 40:56.978
Eventually,
you will come to believe in yourself

40:56.979 --> 40:59.542
as much as I do.

41:04.507 --> 41:06.548
Hey. Sorry to intrude.

41:06.549 --> 41:08.389
Oh, come on in.
Oh.

41:08.390 --> 41:09.991
What is this?

41:09.992 --> 41:13.154
It's, you know,
just a little thank you for the party.

41:13.155 --> 41:14.756
Don't be ridiculous.

41:14.757 --> 41:16.117
Well, you went to a lot of trouble.

41:16.118 --> 41:19.080
Oh. No, it's nothing. And I had help.

41:19.081 --> 41:20.842
Well, look, I don't want to bother you.

41:20.843 --> 41:22.406
I know you're working.
No, no, no. It's a slow day.

41:22.407 --> 41:23.445
Let's open this.

41:26.248 --> 41:30.452
You experienced heartbreak
and loss early...

41:30.453 --> 41:33.935
only to find love later than most.

41:33.936 --> 41:35.537
Mm.

41:35.538 --> 41:38.146
And because of that...

41:39.061 --> 41:43.024
and relationships should
tend to be a bit selfish.

41:43.025 --> 41:45.266
I'll have you know, I am very giving.

41:45.267 --> 41:47.509
No, I'm sorry. I'm not seeing that.

41:47.510 --> 41:49.150
I want my gift basket back.

41:49.151 --> 41:50.366
No refunds.

41:51.634 --> 41:53.995
So, how does this stuff work?

41:53.996 --> 41:57.398
Um, are you reading me or my hands?

41:57.399 --> 41:59.080
Both.

41:59.081 --> 42:02.629
You realize that these lines
are present from birth.

42:04.286 --> 42:06.087
It's true.

42:06.088 --> 42:08.410
They're determined by how
we clench our fists in the womb,

42:08.411 --> 42:10.171
so it tells you more about
how someone's gonna

42:10.172 --> 42:12.534
throw a punch than what
their sex life is like.

42:12.535 --> 42:15.497
Do I come into your office
and tell you how to do your job?

42:15.498 --> 42:18.339
Yes. Twice.

42:18.340 --> 42:20.341
Actually,
I think it was more like three times.

42:42.885 --> 42:44.504
I'm sorry.

42:45.568 --> 42:47.248
I don't know why I did that.

42:47.249 --> 42:48.716
Uh...

42:50.052 --> 42:51.427
Oh.

42:52.094 --> 42:53.971
I should go.

42:59.141 --> 43:02.664
Oh, fuck.

43:04.691 --> 43:06.228
Fuck.
