00:37.662 --> 00:39.731
<i>I read a quote
the other day. Somebody like</i>

00:39.999 --> 00:41.700
<i>can't remember if it was
p.T. Barnum</i>

00:41.766 --> 00:44.036
<i>or Henry David Thoreau that</i>

00:44.103 --> 00:45.770
<i>said that democracy is based
on the notion</i>

00:45.837 --> 00:48.473
<i>that ordinary people
can do extraordinary things.</i>

00:49.641 --> 00:53.012
<i>Societal pressures tend to keep
our abilities quashed down.</i>

00:53.611 --> 00:55.014
<i>We don't sing. We don't dance</i>

00:55.081 --> 00:57.615
<i>because the professionals
do it for us.</i>

00:58.650 --> 01:00.785
<i>But in order to do improvisation</i>

01:01.020 --> 01:03.755
<i>you have to have
some respect for</i>

01:03.822 --> 01:05.890
the possibilities of
human abilities.

01:06.125 --> 01:07.559
Like

01:07.625 --> 01:10.695
you have to assume that people
can do extraordinary things

01:12.797 --> 01:14.833
we've got a real special treat
for you right now

01:14.899 --> 01:17.502
it's my pleasure
to introduce to you

01:17.970 --> 01:20.572
ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Del close.

01:32.550 --> 01:34.353
<i>If you've never
heard of del close</i>

01:34.420 --> 01:35.787
<i>well, congratulations</i>

01:37.123 --> 01:38.790
<i>that means you're not a comedian</i>

01:38.857 --> 01:41.360
<i>which all in all, is probably
good news for you.</i>

01:41.427 --> 01:42.995
<i>If you are a comedian,</i>

01:43.062 --> 01:44.739
<i>then you know this actor
turned comedy guru</i>

01:44.763 --> 01:47.532
<i>trained pretty much
everyone in the business.</i>

01:47.599 --> 01:49.135
<i>He was like a living legend.</i>

01:49.201 --> 01:50.769
<i>If you don't know del close,
Google him.</i>

01:50.835 --> 01:52.981
<i>He's done everything interesting
in comedy, in my opinion.</i>

01:53.005 --> 01:54.182
What do you want to see
a show about?

01:54.206 --> 01:55.074
- Yeah, I'm talking to you!
<i>- Um...</i>

01:55.141 --> 01:55.807
Um, crime!

01:55.874 --> 01:58.210
An excellent suggestion!

01:59.844 --> 02:02.148
<i>Del close showed me
the connection between</i>

02:02.214 --> 02:03.748
comedy and bigger ideas.

02:03.815 --> 02:05.384
We're not worthy!

02:05.451 --> 02:06.318
<i>Oh yeah, the cult of del</i>

02:06.385 --> 02:09.088
it should be the church of del.

02:09.155 --> 02:10.399
<i>Del taught me
the whole concept of just</i>

02:10.423 --> 02:13.025
being bold in your life
and being fearless.

02:13.092 --> 02:15.061
I'm just trying
to put you to bed.

02:15.127 --> 02:17.196
No! Me baby!

02:17.263 --> 02:18.797
Baby no go night night!

02:18.863 --> 02:19.943
<i>It was the first time I was</i>

02:21.367 --> 02:22.535
<i>part of a bohemian culture</i>

02:22.600 --> 02:25.603
I was around gay people.
I was around white people

02:25.870 --> 02:27.639
that... I was around white people

02:28.773 --> 02:30.742
<i>a whole lot of white people</i>

02:32.445 --> 02:34.022
<i>del, thanks for
teaching me everything I know.</i>

02:34.046 --> 02:35.948
<i>Being present in the moment.
In a scene.</i>

02:37.183 --> 02:39.018
And not going for a cheap gag
or a cheap joke.

02:39.485 --> 02:40.585
Thanks honey.

02:42.388 --> 02:43.432
<i>And that's just
a smattering of comedians</i>

02:43.456 --> 02:45.958
<i>who studied with del close.</i>

02:46.025 --> 02:47.568
<i>Dozens of those comics started
their own del-inspired theaters</i>

02:47.592 --> 02:50.996
<i>passing down the wisedom to a
whole new crop of comedy nerds.</i>

02:51.063 --> 02:52.730
<i>Del has created now</i>

02:52.797 --> 02:54.599
multiple generations of people

02:54.799 --> 02:56.168
<i>who seek even more freedom</i>

02:56.235 --> 02:58.437
<i>like the free jazz of the 60s
and 70s.</i>

02:58.504 --> 03:01.006
This is a very pretentious
comparison, I know

03:01.073 --> 03:02.441
- I like it.
- See!

03:02.508 --> 03:04.176
But I'm an eccentric.

03:04.243 --> 03:05.683
<i>That's three
generations of comedians</i>

03:06.145 --> 03:07.046
<i>if you're keeping track.</i>

03:07.113 --> 03:08.713
<i>All of them chasing this myth</i>

03:08.780 --> 03:11.850
<i>of the guru who discovered
a new art form...</i>

03:11.916 --> 03:13.152
<i>Improvised comedy.</i>

03:14.786 --> 03:16.388
<i>Which, for some reason,
he called Harold.</i>

03:16.455 --> 03:19.225
<i>And a friend of mine said</i>

03:19.291 --> 03:19.959
<i>they're doing this pure
improvised show.</i>

03:20.025 --> 03:21.860
It's called Harold.

03:21.927 --> 03:23.905
<i>I went down and I watched it
and I thought, this is for me!</i>

03:23.929 --> 03:25.697
<i>I have to improvise.</i>

03:25.763 --> 03:26.532
<i>A lot of the
comedy everyone is used to</i>

03:26.599 --> 03:28.100
they improvise like crazy.

03:29.634 --> 03:30.536
<i>I mean, look at
judd apatow's films.</i>

03:30.603 --> 03:31.470
<i>There's so much improvisation.</i>

03:31.537 --> 03:33.638
I've never been in one... judd.

03:35.174 --> 03:35.941
<i>When we did "anchorman"</i>

03:36.008 --> 03:36.674
<i>and "Talladega nights"</i>

03:36.741 --> 03:38.978
we improvised for hours.

03:39.044 --> 03:40.645
The skeleton took a shower

03:40.712 --> 03:42.290
the skeleton ran out of shampoo
in the shower.

03:42.314 --> 03:45.284
<i>Which was heavily
inspired by del close.</i>

03:45.351 --> 03:47.987
The human torch could not
get a bank loan.

03:49.054 --> 03:50.788
The human torch

03:50.855 --> 03:52.033
<i>so one cameraman
if you look at his dailies,</i>

03:52.057 --> 03:53.993
you can see the camera
move a little bit.

03:56.861 --> 03:57.896
<i>Sure, laugh it up</i>

04:00.399 --> 04:03.002
<i>but del's path of destruction
has cut through almost every</i>

04:03.068 --> 04:05.504
<i>seminal comedy moment
of the last sixty years.</i>

04:05.571 --> 04:08.240
<i>Which is all the more amazing
when you realize he was</i>

04:08.307 --> 04:10.808
I bite myself,
I bite myself, I bite myself

04:10.875 --> 04:12.511
<i>literally nuts.</i>

04:12.578 --> 04:13.479
<i>There was a period where del</i>

04:13.546 --> 04:14.655
<i>was doing shows at second city</i>

04:14.679 --> 04:16.415
where he was
in the mental hospital.

04:16.482 --> 04:17.283
They had to go pick him up

04:17.349 --> 04:18.850
bring him back to do a show

04:18.917 --> 04:20.228
<i>and then take him back
to the mental hospital.</i>

04:20.252 --> 04:21.452
He was a fucking crazy person.

04:22.087 --> 04:22.621
He was crazy.

04:22.687 --> 04:24.223
Undecided!

04:24.290 --> 04:25.790
<i>I think with that crazyness</i>

04:26.959 --> 04:27.959
he's kind of a genius.

04:31.063 --> 04:32.374
<i>So how did a mad man
manage to change</i>

04:32.398 --> 04:34.166
<i>the face of comedy
as we know it?</i>

04:35.634 --> 04:37.145
<i>And end up with roughly the same
name recognition</i>

04:37.169 --> 04:39.104
<i>as a third tier fast food chain?</i>

04:40.905 --> 04:42.907
<i>Well, you can't ask him
because frankly, he's dead.</i>

04:44.410 --> 04:45.690
<i>But he did leave behind
one clue.</i>

05:06.864 --> 05:08.934
<i>The burn of the...</i>

05:12.238 --> 05:13.939
<i>Uh, nickel, dimed, and quartered</i>

05:14.006 --> 05:14.772
<i>uh yeah</i>

05:14.839 --> 05:16.342
<i>the goddamn fog</i>

05:17.977 --> 05:19.011
<i>ooh! Matin' with Satan.</i>

05:19.078 --> 05:21.313
No! The creamin' demon

05:21.380 --> 05:22.548
which one?

05:22.615 --> 05:24.250
The creamin' demon

05:24.316 --> 05:25.316
<i>what am I looking at?</i>

05:27.019 --> 05:28.663
<i>Is maybe what you're asking
yourself right now.</i>

05:28.687 --> 05:30.990
<i>Well, del close has just
been hired to write</i>

05:31.056 --> 05:32.958
<i>a comic book about his life.</i>

05:33.659 --> 05:34.960
<i>For DC comics, no less.</i>

05:36.562 --> 05:37.997
<i>Emergency room service?</i>

05:38.063 --> 05:39.198
<i>No, no... emergency...</i>

05:39.265 --> 05:41.967
- Rumors!
<i>- Rumors!</i>

05:42.034 --> 05:42.834
Great minds.

05:42.900 --> 05:45.204
<i>And this is his team.</i>

05:45.271 --> 05:48.007
Smell... of the mega brain.

05:48.207 --> 05:50.009
<i>Here's del. Full of ideas.</i>

05:50.075 --> 05:51.710
Sniff and crawl.

05:51.809 --> 05:53.878
<i>Only problem is
they're all batshit.</i>

05:53.946 --> 05:55.381
Done.

05:55.447 --> 05:57.616
<i>That's Mike gold, del's editor,</i>

05:57.683 --> 06:00.852
<i>trying to turn batshit
into comic books.</i>

06:01.086 --> 06:02.887
<i>Well, he was insane.</i>

06:02.955 --> 06:05.624
Now, I like that.

06:05.691 --> 06:08.260
Insane people come up
with great stories.

06:08.327 --> 06:11.063
They go places nobody's ever
been before.

06:11.130 --> 06:13.132
What happened to Merlin?

06:13.198 --> 06:15.934
Feed us... the fetus

06:16.001 --> 06:17.269
<i>here's John ostrander,</i>

06:17.336 --> 06:18.637
<i>del's trusty writing partner.</i>

06:18.704 --> 06:21.140
<i>He's just happy to be
in the room,</i>

06:21.206 --> 06:23.409
<i>even if it smells like an
ashtray full of farts.</i>

06:24.009 --> 06:26.878
<i>Many times, I go,
how did del and I ever</i>

06:26.945 --> 06:27.945
<i>together?</i>

06:28.347 --> 06:30.949
Del is... hip.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.285
<i>I'm a square.</i>

06:33.352 --> 06:35.154
<i>I'm so square, I'm almost cute.</i>

06:35.220 --> 06:36.220
But I knew comics,

06:36.255 --> 06:37.956
but he was del.

06:38.023 --> 06:39.658
He had this imagination.

06:39.725 --> 06:41.060
Probably there's androids.

06:41.126 --> 06:42.361
Probably..

06:42.428 --> 06:42.995
- Probably there's androids.
- There might be...

06:43.062 --> 06:44.862
You know what?

06:44.930 --> 06:47.132
<i>Oh, and all del's
lines here are direct quotes</i>

06:49.034 --> 06:51.194
<i>taken from tape recordings
he made throughout his life.</i>

06:51.236 --> 06:52.547
Starting with the
audition process...

06:52.571 --> 06:55.007
<i>Anyway, back to 1987.</i>

06:55.074 --> 06:56.442
Witches in Toronto.

06:57.543 --> 06:58.876
I love that.

06:58.944 --> 06:59.812
<i>Witches...</i>

06:59.877 --> 07:00.312
Toronto freaks me the fuck out.

07:00.379 --> 07:03.115
Right?

07:03.182 --> 07:04.592
<i>That is great.
Can I get an outline on that?</i>

07:04.616 --> 07:05.417
- Witches in Toronto, Thursday?
- Yeah, yeah, you bet.

07:05.484 --> 07:06.618
<i>Beautiful</i>

07:06.685 --> 07:08.454
- did you write that?
<i>- Good.</i>

07:08.520 --> 07:09.822
<i>I got it.</i>

07:09.887 --> 07:10.322
<i>Witches in Toronto.</i>

07:10.389 --> 07:10.922
I got it.

07:10.989 --> 07:12.424
Thank you, John.

07:12.491 --> 07:14.226
<i>I was the outside-the-box guy</i>

07:14.293 --> 07:15.694
<i>over at DC.</i>

07:15.761 --> 07:17.281
<i>They had just started
"the dark knight"</i>

07:18.130 --> 07:20.490
<i>and "watchmen" and, you know,
they were feeling pretty good.</i>

07:20.566 --> 07:22.701
And they figured this is
a good time to sort of

07:22.768 --> 07:27.206
<i>push the boundaries of comics
and enjoy the surreal.</i>

07:29.007 --> 07:30.075
That's del.

07:31.844 --> 07:36.281
<i>Anybody who ventures
into the land of del close</i>

07:37.249 --> 07:40.085
<i>hears all of these
del close stories.</i>

07:40.152 --> 07:41.886
And they're phenomenal.

07:41.954 --> 07:45.190
<i>We famously
dine out on del's stories.</i>

07:45.391 --> 07:46.431
We feast on del's stories.

07:47.526 --> 07:49.728
I wanted to get some of those
in print.

07:51.230 --> 07:54.066
<i>Del volunteered for some tests</i>

07:54.133 --> 07:55.134
<i>for the U.S. air force.</i>

07:55.200 --> 07:57.002
<i>They would give people acid</i>

07:57.069 --> 07:59.104
and they monitor their dreams.

07:59.304 --> 08:00.905
<i>He left the experiment</i>

08:00.973 --> 08:02.653
<i>and he ended up
getting a letter that said:</i>

08:02.708 --> 08:06.078
<i>"Mr. Close, you owe
the United States air force</i>

08:06.145 --> 08:07.179
one more dream."

08:08.814 --> 08:09.648
<i>So I'm driving
through the streets</i>

08:09.715 --> 08:10.616
<i>of San Francisco,</i>

08:10.682 --> 08:12.985
<i>and del is going to eat fire.</i>

08:13.051 --> 08:14.286
<i>He pulled it out,</i>

08:14.353 --> 08:16.321
and that thing of flame
shoots out

08:16.388 --> 08:18.457
<i>and my car caught fire.</i>

08:19.525 --> 08:20.826
<i>He met Tennessee Williams.</i>

08:20.893 --> 08:22.394
<i>And he reaches out,
and he shakes</i>

08:22.461 --> 08:24.129
Tennessee Williams' hand,

08:24.196 --> 08:25.697
and a cockroach crawls out

08:25.764 --> 08:28.333
<i>from his sleeve onto
tennesee Williams.</i>

08:28.400 --> 08:29.468
<i>And del goes</i>

08:29.535 --> 08:31.370
"excuse me, I believe
that's mine."

08:32.304 --> 08:33.806
And sticks it in his pocket.

08:33.872 --> 08:34.540
<i>Del's whole movie-acting career</i>

08:34.606 --> 08:36.542
is just so bizarre.

08:39.311 --> 08:40.112
<i>I know he did
a lot of weird films</i>

08:40.179 --> 08:41.356
and stuff earlier in his career.

08:41.380 --> 08:44.183
He had two parts in
"the untouchables".

08:44.249 --> 08:45.484
- That's right.
- Two parts.

08:45.551 --> 08:48.086
You fellas are untouchable,
is that the thing?

08:48.153 --> 08:50.088
<i>There's a story
of him with I. Ron Hubbard.</i>

08:50.155 --> 08:52.224
<i>He was a science fiction writer
that del loved,</i>

08:52.291 --> 08:54.226
and I. Ron was complaining
about the fact that

08:54.293 --> 08:56.562
he was getting taxed so heavily,

08:56.628 --> 08:58.430
and he said,
"well, form a church."

09:00.065 --> 09:01.745
<i>And he said,
"alright, maybe I'll do that."</i>

09:03.368 --> 09:04.879
<i>He was a natural.
These stories are so unusual.</i>

09:04.903 --> 09:07.506
<i>And, in comics,
you have free reign.</i>

09:09.174 --> 09:10.852
<i>For "wasteland",
del would be given full freedom</i>

09:10.876 --> 09:12.444
<i>with the comic book form.</i>

09:12.511 --> 09:14.246
<i>Using a variety of artists,
del could go</i>

09:14.313 --> 09:14.948
<i>literal,</i>

09:15.013 --> 09:15.647
<i>metaphorical,</i>

09:15.714 --> 09:16.448
<i>hallucinatory,</i>

09:16.515 --> 09:17.015
<i>conceptual,</i>

09:17.082 --> 09:17.951
<i>meta,</i>

09:18.016 --> 09:20.686
<i>whatever... this is.</i>

09:20.752 --> 09:23.188
<i>All in service of excavating
his own life story.</i>

09:23.455 --> 09:26.325
<i>Which also happens to be
the story of an entire</i>

09:26.391 --> 09:28.193
<i>comedy movement.</i>

09:28.260 --> 09:29.995
<i>You know,
I'm writing my autobiography.</i>

09:31.797 --> 09:32.564
<i>- You are?
- In a comic book, yeah.</i>

09:32.631 --> 09:35.467
<i>Great!</i>

09:35.534 --> 09:36.912
<i>It's in a comic book called
"wasteland". It's, uh, for DC.</i>

09:36.936 --> 09:39.171
<i>- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

09:39.238 --> 09:40.706
<i>But what, why?</i>

09:40.772 --> 09:42.450
<i>But I wanted to
leave behind the great lessons</i>

09:42.474 --> 09:43.675
<i>really?</i>

09:43.742 --> 09:45.611
<i>Indeed, the secrets of comedy.</i>

09:46.378 --> 09:47.412
Okey, doke.

09:49.047 --> 09:49.748
<i>That's, I think,
part of the reason why</i>

09:49.815 --> 09:50.883
he liked "wasteland".

09:50.950 --> 09:53.118
Because he had a chance
to do more,

09:54.386 --> 09:56.130
and even with some of the
autobiography pieces,

09:56.154 --> 09:57.222
to show more.

09:58.958 --> 09:59.591
<i>He wanted to reveal what
he'd learned in the past</i>

09:59.658 --> 10:01.226
<i>about comedy.</i>

10:02.861 --> 10:04.305
<i>The concept was
the first issue would be of</i>

10:04.329 --> 10:08.467
del's origin, or as close to
an origin story as possible.

10:23.482 --> 10:24.349
<i>Yeah, I worked for Dr. Dracula.</i>

10:24.416 --> 10:27.452
<i>I was his assistant.</i>

10:27.519 --> 10:29.719
<i>I carried out a flaming bowl
while Dr. Dracula ate fire.</i>

10:30.689 --> 10:32.166
<i>Del used to tell
everybody that studied with him</i>

10:32.190 --> 10:35.294
about running away from home,
and going and traveling with

10:35.360 --> 10:37.429
Dr. Dracula's tomb of terror.

10:38.263 --> 10:41.266
<i>There was this old guy
who played Dr. Dracula.</i>

10:41.333 --> 10:44.069
<i>He would get up, and he would do
a magic act.</i>

10:44.469 --> 10:46.371
<i>And you learned how to
eat fire from him?</i>

10:46.438 --> 10:48.238
<i>No, he wouldn't teach me.
I learned on my own.</i>

10:48.473 --> 10:51.209
<i>And my entrance music was.</i>

10:57.449 --> 10:59.209
<i>Dr. Dracula would come down
to the footlights</i>

10:59.251 --> 11:00.552
<i>and he would say,</i>

11:00.619 --> 11:02.421
<i>"a plague of worms will descend
upon you",</i>

11:02.487 --> 11:04.991
<i>and the lights would go out,
and I would run up the aisle</i>

11:05.058 --> 11:06.498
<i>throwing cooked spaghetti
everywhere.</i>

11:07.626 --> 11:09.595
<i>And the audience would literally
go "wah!"</i>

11:22.240 --> 11:23.909
<i>My first show business
experience</i>

11:23.977 --> 11:26.478
<i>you know, and I cause people
to shit their pants.</i>

11:26.545 --> 11:28.222
You know, man, and it's been
downhill ever since.

11:28.246 --> 11:29.314
<i>I know what del means.</i>

11:29.381 --> 11:31.583
If I was onstage and something
I did

11:31.650 --> 11:35.120
led someone in the audience
to say, "I just shit my pants!"

11:35.420 --> 11:36.521
Oh my god!

11:37.322 --> 11:38.857
<i>It's an amazing thing.</i>

11:38.924 --> 11:40.525
<i>This line between, kind of,
is it great?</i>

11:40.592 --> 11:44.463
<i>Or is it wrong? Should I be
scared or should I be laughing?</i>

11:44.696 --> 11:47.265
<i>What journey can you take
an audience on?</i>

11:47.466 --> 11:48.968
<i>It was like performance art</i>

11:49.035 --> 11:52.304
meets improv, which I think is
what del was kind of all about.

11:52.771 --> 11:56.308
<i>He just loved that weird,
subversive world.</i>

11:56.508 --> 11:57.743
<i>Even if the audience hated it</i>

11:58.377 --> 11:59.377
he was like

11:59.411 --> 12:00.411
killed it!

12:02.048 --> 12:03.524
<i>Freaking people out
as a teenage carnie runaway</i>

12:03.548 --> 12:04.908
<i>was a perfect origin story
for del.</i>

12:06.284 --> 12:08.353
<i>But what was he running from?</i>

12:24.703 --> 12:27.372
<i>Del's life as a child
was really ordinary</i>

12:27.439 --> 12:28.540
<i>growing up in Kansas</i>

12:30.409 --> 12:32.569
<i>he was much smarter than most
of the kids in his class.</i>

12:33.378 --> 12:35.523
<i>You know, by all conventional
standards, he was brilliant.</i>

12:35.547 --> 12:38.750
<i>But his father didn't see that.</i>

12:39.384 --> 12:43.588
<i>Del loved his mother.
He wanted to love his father.</i>

12:44.090 --> 12:45.090
<i>And then...</i>

12:48.326 --> 12:50.029
John, can I talk
to del for a minute?

12:50.096 --> 12:51.096
<i>Yeah.</i>

12:51.530 --> 12:53.498
Enjoy... this.

12:53.565 --> 12:55.300
<i>Del,</i>

12:55.367 --> 12:57.769
<i>I just want to say, I love
all the Dr. Dracula stuff</i>

12:57.836 --> 12:59.671
it's great.
The guy pooping his pants.

13:01.473 --> 13:02.583
<i>But I was also wondering,
maybe there's something...</i>

13:02.607 --> 13:05.510
A little darker
from your childhood?

13:06.112 --> 13:09.781
More appropriate for our little
grotesque booklet here?

13:11.117 --> 13:12.217
Nah.

13:13.285 --> 13:15.420
Anything from before
you left Kansas?

13:15.487 --> 13:17.756
Something rotten
in the little apple?

13:19.125 --> 13:21.626
Daddy drinks the dark dram.

13:22.894 --> 13:25.363
Sometimes it's hard to deal
with the thing

13:26.765 --> 13:28.600
in terms of the thing itself.

13:29.768 --> 13:30.768
You know?

13:37.043 --> 13:39.845
<i>The thing itself,
an incendiary thing.</i>

13:41.880 --> 13:44.449
<i>Del told a story
throughout his life</i>

13:44.516 --> 13:46.585
<i>"the big story", some thought
of it as</i>

13:47.153 --> 13:49.788
<i>when del was eight, his father
called him over.</i>

13:49.989 --> 13:52.591
<i>He asked his son to bring him
a glass of water he left</i>

13:52.657 --> 13:53.658
<i>on the counter.</i>

13:55.094 --> 13:56.795
<i>Eager to please,
del does as he's told.</i>

13:56.862 --> 14:00.265
<i>And watches as his father
drains the entire glass.</i>

14:00.465 --> 14:01.833
<i>First come the convulsions,</i>

14:03.502 --> 14:05.670
<i>then the glass smashes
as del's father goes limp.</i>

14:07.539 --> 14:09.875
<i>As it turned out, the glass
didn't contain water at all.</i>

14:10.575 --> 14:13.411
<i>It was battery acid
del learned later.</i>

14:27.994 --> 14:30.295
<i>There's at the
heart of that a betrayal.</i>

14:30.796 --> 14:32.430
<i>A father's betrayal of the son.</i>

14:32.831 --> 14:33.966
<i>Okay...</i>

14:34.033 --> 14:35.801
Commiting suicide,
I'm not judging that,

14:37.203 --> 14:39.771
but to do it, in that manner,
in front of your son,

14:40.206 --> 14:43.675
that's a betrayal, that's...
By my likes.

14:47.479 --> 14:50.515
<i>He started swallowing fire</i>

14:50.582 --> 14:51.750
<i>at a very early age.</i>

14:53.618 --> 14:55.496
<i>To me, if you were going to
psychoanalyze a person whose</i>

14:55.520 --> 14:56.922
<i>father commited suicide,</i>

14:58.590 --> 15:01.726
<i>you might wonder why they're
swallowing fire.</i>

15:04.596 --> 15:05.697
Just asking.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.319
<i>After traveling with Dr. Dracula</i>

15:26.384 --> 15:30.755
<i>del was hired as a
"human torch" in Bermuda.</i>

15:32.891 --> 15:36.561
<i>And then del got another call,
not long after that,</i>

15:36.628 --> 15:38.164
<i>from his friend, severn darden</i>

15:38.231 --> 15:40.474
<i>"and he said," hey, there's this
theater action happening</i>

15:40.498 --> 15:42.068
<i>in St. Louis.</i>

15:42.134 --> 15:44.134
<i>"You really should come out,
and give this a shot."</i>

15:44.270 --> 15:46.705
As del says, "well, I'd only
dove three times.

15:46.771 --> 15:48.040
The wind kept shifting.

15:48.107 --> 15:50.009
So this sounded like
a pretty good alternative."

15:51.910 --> 15:53.712
<i>So del headed out
to join the newly formed,</i>

15:53.778 --> 15:54.846
<i>compass players.</i>

15:56.349 --> 15:57.358
<i>Not knowing that he was walking
into the one thing</i>

15:57.382 --> 15:59.651
<i>more dangerous than fire:</i>

16:01.419 --> 16:03.339
<i>The world's first fully
improvised comedy troupe.</i>

16:04.623 --> 16:06.068
<i>What I did over the last
couple of days was like</i>

16:06.092 --> 16:08.627
<i>put myself back into that
period of time</i>

16:08.693 --> 16:09.794
<i>and I was just amazed.</i>

16:11.264 --> 16:12.640
<i>It was definitely
a creative experience.</i>

16:12.664 --> 16:14.399
<i>It was like unmatched
perhaps on the planet.</i>

16:15.700 --> 16:19.537
The compass theater was
the first group of people

16:19.604 --> 16:23.842
dedicated to making theatre
out of improvised work.

16:24.310 --> 16:27.980
<i>Geniuses, and dropouts,
beatniks, weirdos.</i>

16:28.914 --> 16:31.683
<i>Highly evolved, very intelligent</i>

16:32.318 --> 16:35.620
<i>the task we were taking on
which nobody had ever done</i>

16:35.687 --> 16:38.590
<i>was to, somehow or another,
train ourselves to improvise</i>

16:38.790 --> 16:40.425
<i>whatever that was.</i>

16:40.625 --> 16:42.128
<i>There was no script.</i>

16:42.194 --> 16:43.714
<i>And we would do a new show
every night.</i>

16:45.097 --> 16:46.574
<i>We would open usually
with some kind of like</i>

16:46.598 --> 16:49.368
<i>some mad opening
that I would start</i>

16:49.434 --> 16:50.236
<i>like sometimes, I remember,
we would sometimes come in</i>

16:50.303 --> 16:51.583
<i>wearing helmets with flashlights</i>

16:52.470 --> 16:53.105
<i>examining the audience members
as though they were</i>

16:53.172 --> 16:54.172
<i>complex fungi.</i>

16:56.242 --> 16:57.776
<i>And then we would take
suggestions.</i>

16:57.842 --> 16:59.402
<i>We would do a scene
on every suggestion.</i>

17:00.545 --> 17:02.714
<i>I just remember the horror
that everybody felt</i>

17:02.781 --> 17:04.221
<i>before somebody spoke
the first word.</i>

17:11.456 --> 17:13.296
<i>We would just go out
and do literally anything.</i>

17:14.193 --> 17:14.826
<i>Sometimes the audience
was fucking bored.</i>

17:14.893 --> 17:15.893
<i>Right.</i>

17:18.397 --> 17:19.957
<i>But sometimes
we would be doing a scene,</i>

17:19.999 --> 17:22.199
<i>and we would just blurt
these amazing, wonderful things.</i>

17:31.743 --> 17:33.045
<i>We just didn't know why</i>

17:33.112 --> 17:34.447
<i>our successful work
was successful</i>

17:34.512 --> 17:36.015
<i>and why our failures
were failures,</i>

17:38.351 --> 17:40.618
<i>so we can chuckle now, but
this was quite serious</i>

17:40.685 --> 17:41.685
<i>right.</i>

17:44.756 --> 17:46.556
<i>In improvisation,
each performance was a risk.</i>

17:48.394 --> 17:49.870
<i>But del sensed that a little
danger could be just the thing</i>

17:49.894 --> 17:52.530
<i>for a genre that had become...</i>

17:52.897 --> 17:53.933
<i>How do I say this?</i>

17:54.000 --> 17:55.567
Ah, good evening,
ladies and gentlemen

17:56.534 --> 17:57.534
<i>shitty.</i>

17:58.437 --> 18:00.572
<i>A lot of the comedy on TV,</i>

18:00.638 --> 18:01.906
<i>the kind of Bob hope stuff</i>

18:01.974 --> 18:03.976
made me feel kind of gross.

18:04.043 --> 18:06.778
And I want to be sure, at all
times, to do the right thing.

18:09.714 --> 18:10.714
That's the right thing.

18:12.118 --> 18:12.952
<i>So that older
generation of comedy</i>

18:13.019 --> 18:14.987
<i>was a palliative.</i>

18:15.054 --> 18:16.088
<i>You know, it was meant to</i>

18:17.189 --> 18:18.400
make life okay,
and you can laugh,

18:18.424 --> 18:19.700
and we'll laugh,
and we'll all be nice people.

18:19.724 --> 18:22.727
Let's not do any jokes
we didn't plan on, huh?

18:24.662 --> 18:26.241
<i>As it turned out,
there were plenty of people</i>

18:26.265 --> 18:28.733
<i>who were tired of Bob hope's
dick jokes.</i>

18:30.802 --> 18:32.162
<i>So the compass was
packing them in.</i>

18:33.638 --> 18:36.541
<i>To fill the need, they brought
in two new cast members.</i>

18:36.841 --> 18:38.877
<i>Mike Nichols, and Elaine may</i>

18:41.913 --> 18:45.550
<i>yep, that Nichols and may,
but we'll get to that</i>

18:47.552 --> 18:49.131
<i>but like Mike was there
in order to work with Elaine</i>

18:49.155 --> 18:50.588
<i>uh huh.</i>

18:50.655 --> 18:52.191
<i>Elaine was there, to,
you know, work</i>

18:52.258 --> 18:54.893
<i>in improvisational theatre
right, right.</i>

18:54.960 --> 18:56.238
<i>And so Mike's reasons for
being there were</i>

18:56.262 --> 18:57.063
<i>- a little shaky.
- Right.</i>

18:57.129 --> 18:58.630
<i>And she was able to adapt to it?</i>

18:58.696 --> 19:00.732
<i>Yep, she was able to adapt
to real improvisation.</i>

19:02.168 --> 19:03.445
<i>Elaine was absolutely
fucking amazing.</i>

19:03.469 --> 19:04.937
<i>And fearless.</i>

19:05.004 --> 19:09.641
I have been going with the same
man for the last fourteen years.

19:10.875 --> 19:13.845
Last week, I got the shock
of my life.

19:14.046 --> 19:16.215
There, sitting at
a sidewalk cafe

19:16.282 --> 19:18.783
was my intended
with another woman.

19:19.051 --> 19:21.920
I asked him,
"what is the meaning of this?"

19:22.121 --> 19:24.156
In reply, they both stood up,

19:24.223 --> 19:26.858
and gave me such
a merciless beating.

19:28.693 --> 19:31.964
<i>Del and Elaine may
shared the same kind of</i>

19:32.031 --> 19:36.102
<i>dogged persistence to figure out
what could you do to make</i>

19:36.168 --> 19:38.003
<i>improvisation consistent.</i>

19:39.637 --> 19:40.848
<i>And this was Elaine may's line,</i>

19:40.872 --> 19:42.740
I love this - tell me
what I need to know

19:43.476 --> 19:45.710
to get off stage without dying.

19:46.312 --> 19:48.013
And they came up
with the kitchen rules.

19:49.482 --> 19:50.983
<i>He and Elaine apparently
constructed</i>

19:51.050 --> 19:53.685
<i>a whole set of rules.
I think they called it,</i>

19:53.751 --> 19:56.956
<i>"the Winchester kitchen table
rules of improvisation".</i>

20:00.226 --> 20:02.694
<i>Like, don't deny, respect
the other person's reality.</i>

20:02.760 --> 20:04.230
<i>Right.</i>

20:04.296 --> 20:04.930
<i>Remember where the objects were</i>

20:04.997 --> 20:05.931
<i>right.</i>

20:05.998 --> 20:06.764
<i>Uh, don't do mime.</i>

20:06.831 --> 20:09.401
<i>That's right.</i>

20:09.468 --> 20:10.845
<i>Always play
to popular intelligence.</i>

20:10.869 --> 20:13.606
<i>- And think the unlikely choice.
- Right.</i>

20:13.671 --> 20:14.306
<i>We're not locked into
this thing like an actor</i>

20:14.373 --> 20:15.373
<i>with a script.</i>

20:16.275 --> 20:17.576
<i>He met his match,</i>

20:17.642 --> 20:20.912
and I think they had
a romantic engagement as well.

20:22.581 --> 20:24.383
<i>Elaine, I was thinking
about this,</i>

20:24.450 --> 20:26.885
<i>I mean, of course, she was
frightening and intimidating,</i>

20:26.952 --> 20:27.819
<i>I mean, the goddess is more
evident in her</i>

20:27.886 --> 20:29.188
<i>than in most people.</i>

20:29.255 --> 20:31.656
<i>And you know, right</i>

20:31.723 --> 20:33.225
<i>in all of her phases right</i>

20:33.292 --> 20:33.925
<i>the wrathful one,
and the beautiful one.</i>

20:33.993 --> 20:34.792
<i>Right.</i>

20:34.859 --> 20:37.463
<i>It's, uh,</i>

20:37.530 --> 20:39.074
<i>it's like she was
a supernatural figure.</i>

20:39.098 --> 20:40.542
<i>I kept having all these,
what am I doing here?</i>

20:40.566 --> 20:42.901
<i>Why am I in the midst
of all this here?</i>

20:42.968 --> 20:43.835
<i>I was fairly
mentally unstable in those days</i>

20:43.902 --> 20:44.903
<i>cause I was still...</i>

20:44.970 --> 20:47.072
<i>In my father's killing zone.</i>

20:48.706 --> 20:52.011
<i>Everybody says you were
madly in love with Elaine.</i>

20:52.077 --> 20:54.280
<i>- I have her at...
- And vice versa.</i>

20:55.080 --> 20:58.783
<i>Actually, we never
officially broke up.</i>

20:58.984 --> 21:00.286
<i>And I still love her.</i>

21:01.886 --> 21:04.023
<i>Del had met
the two loves of his life.</i>

21:04.256 --> 21:06.791
<i>Improvisation and Elaine.</i>

21:06.858 --> 21:07.960
<i>He was in paradise.</i>

21:09.228 --> 21:10.628
<i>But there was
a snake in the garden.</i>

21:11.597 --> 21:13.074
<i>Mike Nichols used to say
"Elaine can work with anybody.</i>

21:13.098 --> 21:14.832
<i>I could only work with Elaine."</i>

21:18.237 --> 21:19.538
<i>Moving out of the Bob hope era,</i>

21:19.605 --> 21:21.806
<i>Mike Nichols checked
all the boxes</i>

21:21.873 --> 21:23.042
<i>of the modern comedic genius.</i>

21:23.242 --> 21:24.543
<i>Highly educated and refined,</i>

21:24.610 --> 21:27.046
<i>he was an auteur who
was interested</i>

21:27.112 --> 21:28.880
<i>in the Polish of social satire.</i>

21:29.081 --> 21:30.815
<i>Not the sloppiness of improv.</i>

21:32.518 --> 21:33.861
<i>And that had a good deal
to do with our inability</i>

21:33.885 --> 21:34.885
<i>to get along.</i>

21:36.155 --> 21:37.698
<i>Still somehow or other,
a plot was hatched</i>

21:37.722 --> 21:41.726
<i>to go to New York and audition
as a four-person night club act</i>

21:41.994 --> 21:44.029
<i>to become, maybe, okay, famous.</i>

21:44.263 --> 21:47.166
<i>We did not have plane fare
for the four of us</i>

21:47.233 --> 21:50.802
<i>so we all kicked in money
for Mike and Elaine to go.</i>

21:51.003 --> 21:56.175
<i>So the crucial period comes
when we leave St. Louis</i>

21:56.242 --> 21:57.875
<i>to go to New York.</i>

21:57.943 --> 21:59.354
<i>And I thought it was like,
a guaranteed thing.</i>

21:59.378 --> 22:01.813
<i>When we got to New York,
there was Mike</i>

22:01.879 --> 22:03.282
<i>with a contract
from Jack rollins</i>

22:04.383 --> 22:05.383
<i>for two.</i>

22:05.951 --> 22:07.019
<i>Not four.</i>

22:07.987 --> 22:09.355
<i>So I was left out in the cold.</i>

22:10.855 --> 22:11.789
<i>And at that point,
Mike and Elaine</i>

22:11.856 --> 22:12.856
<i>began working together.</i>

22:31.310 --> 22:34.246
<i>I was absolutely
completely cast adrift</i>

22:37.216 --> 22:39.318
<i>and I went temporarily nuts.</i>

22:52.197 --> 22:54.199
<i>Can you analyze this patient?</i>

22:55.934 --> 22:57.970
<i>He is an adult, white male.</i>

22:58.037 --> 22:59.972
<i>The only child
of well-to-do parents.</i>

23:01.307 --> 23:02.941
<i>Since the recent death
of his father,</i>

23:04.610 --> 23:06.930
<i>the patient has suffered from
severe attacks of depression,</i>

23:07.212 --> 23:08.580
<i>withdrawal,</i>

23:08.647 --> 23:11.083
<i>Apia, catatonic apathy,
and often toys</i>

23:11.150 --> 23:12.384
<i>with the notion of suicide.</i>

23:28.267 --> 23:29.277
Clean family show,
ladies and gentlemen.

23:29.301 --> 23:31.903
No geeks, no freaks, no romedy.

23:34.306 --> 23:36.546
Now, I would like to provide
a selection of danse macabre

23:36.975 --> 23:37.975

del got back on his feet.</i>

23:43.382 --> 23:45.117

<i>So he drifted to the place

23:47.786 --> 23:49.054
<i>lands eventually.</i>

23:55.494 --> 23:56.494
♪ Ow! ♪

23:57.763 --> 23:59.164
<i>There's a story in "wasteland"</i>

23:59.231 --> 24:02.067
<i>where del and his former
writing partner</i>

24:02.134 --> 24:03.778
<i>were sitting around writing,
getting stoned,</i>

24:03.802 --> 24:05.562
<i>trying to figure out
how to be funny onstage.</i>

24:06.138 --> 24:07.406
<i>And their idea was: Okay,</i>

24:08.173 --> 24:10.209
you take some Cole slaw,

24:10.275 --> 24:12.411
and you stick it
down your shorts.

24:15.114 --> 24:18.283
<i>Then as you interact with it,
you're doing interesting things</i>

24:18.350 --> 24:20.885
<i>even though you're too stoned
to really be reacting.</i>

24:21.120 --> 24:24.889
<i>And he said first it worked
just as they figured it would.</i>

24:25.090 --> 24:28.260
<i>It was irritating him,
and was giving his performance</i>

24:28.794 --> 24:29.794

24:30.562 --> 24:32.498
He said, "Howard,

<i>If you're wasted, you tend
to forget what you've done.</i>

24:41.006 --> 24:42.584

he was in the bar,</i>

24:42.608 --> 24:43.409
<i>and he picked up
this sweet young thing,</i>

24:43.475 --> 24:46.311

24:47.112 --> 24:48.514

<i>it was like maybe twenty people

27:26.605 --> 27:28.674
two hours, I remember.

27:32.244 --> 27:36.081
<i>Were those good?
A two hour, twenty people...</i>

27:36.481 --> 27:39.184
Well, I mean it was, um

27:43.789 --> 27:46.658
<i>so we improvised through
the whole workshop,</i>

27:47.626 --> 27:49.227
<i>and then, at the end
of the piece,</i>

27:49.294 --> 27:53.498
<i>everybody fell on the ground,
exhausted from the experience.</i>

27:54.666 --> 27:56.101
<i>It was like...</i>

27:57.003 --> 27:58.003
<i>Okay...</i>

27:58.770 --> 28:00.940
Can we do some more
funny stuff now?

28:08.347 --> 28:09.481
bouncing off the walls,

<i>saying, "we've created
a new form of theatre!"</i>

28:18.357 --> 28:20.325

"right, del.

28:20.392 --> 28:21.593
"Take it easy." You know?

28:23.195 --> 28:23.963
<i>Yeah, well, it's a new form
of theatre.</i>

28:24.030 --> 28:25.764
<i>We need a name for it,</i>

28:25.831 --> 28:27.871
<i>and somebody to, kind of,
undercut del's enthusiasm.</i>

28:29.434 --> 28:31.536
<i>A kind of satiric comment on it.</i>

28:31.737 --> 28:34.539
Said, "well, Harold's
a nice name."

28:38.744 --> 28:42.147
<i>And it became del's holy grail.</i>

28:43.582 --> 28:45.350
<i>Del had found his purpose,</i>

28:45.417 --> 28:47.185
<i>and its name was Harold.</i>

28:47.386 --> 28:48.620
<i>But what was it, exactly?</i>

28:50.322 --> 28:52.290
<i>Well, what del had glimpsed
was just an idea.</i>

28:53.825 --> 28:55.594
<i>The idea that people
could improvise</i>

28:55.661 --> 28:57.781
<i>for long enough to achieve
some greater comic meaning.</i>

28:59.098 --> 29:00.541
<i>And if betting it all
on a half-baked idea</i>

29:00.565 --> 29:01.565
<i>sounds scary</i>

29:03.802 --> 29:05.303
<i>so much the better.</i>

29:14.813 --> 29:16.314
<i>Del was forever wanting</i>

29:17.816 --> 29:19.176
<i>to follow what he wanted
to follow.</i>

29:19.685 --> 29:21.845
He had this imagination,
you know, he had this outlook.

29:23.022 --> 29:24.582
<i>In the summer of love,
in San Francisco,</i>

29:24.623 --> 29:26.725
<i>his new idea wound up
being called "the Harold."</i>

29:28.094 --> 29:30.174
That's what he called it,
at the time, then it stuck.

29:30.362 --> 29:32.464
<i>And del really believed in it.</i>

29:32.864 --> 29:35.634
<i>But somedays, it was hard
to follow del</i>

29:35.701 --> 29:38.203
<i>out to those reaches,

29:38.603 --> 29:39.771

31:33.752 --> 31:35.320
I just said thank you.

31:35.754 --> 31:37.290
Okay.

31:37.355 --> 31:38.824
<i>The praying mantis
can't get it up</i>

31:38.890 --> 31:41.027
<i>until his head has been
gnawed off...</i>

31:41.093 --> 31:42.128
<i>Okay!</i> hello dear.

31:42.195 --> 31:43.296
<i>Yes?</i> here's the deal.

31:43.361 --> 31:44.297
I'm not paying a lot of
attention to your

31:44.362 --> 31:46.731
<i>"waste-lords" right now.</i>

31:46.798 --> 31:48.267
- Oh, "wasteland".
<i>- "Wasteland".</i>

31:48.333 --> 31:49.202
<i>Yeah, and that's a benefit</i>

31:49.268 --> 31:50.444
for both of us, I think, right?

31:50.468 --> 31:52.871
I don't have to read
your gross stories.

31:52.939 --> 31:53.738
Mike gold sent me the outline...

31:53.805 --> 31:54.816
For "retroactive abortion".

31:54.840 --> 31:57.210
It was disgusting, to be frank.

31:57.276 --> 31:58.319
And then you don't have to
deal with me breathing down

31:58.343 --> 31:59.778
your neck. Does that make sense?

31:59.845 --> 32:01.080
<i>- Yes, but...
- Great.</i>

32:01.147 --> 32:02.991
So why don't we instate a policy
of benign neglect?

32:03.015 --> 32:04.783
Leave us alone.

32:04.850 --> 32:05.650
<i>And don't make us
take you anymore seriously</i>

32:05.717 --> 32:06.418
<i>than we want to,</i>

32:06.484 --> 32:08.854
and we'll get alone fine.

32:08.920 --> 32:09.921
<i>Okay, if I can play de...</i>

32:09.989 --> 32:11.690
You know what?
I will go to that.

32:11.756 --> 32:12.557
That's what I thought

32:12.624 --> 32:13.624
okay?

32:17.129 --> 32:18.173
<i>Oh, del loved to push
the boundaries</i>

32:18.197 --> 32:19.598
<i>in a corporate environment.</i>

32:20.866 --> 32:22.510
"Wasteland" is, there's
a sort of, special thing

32:22.534 --> 32:25.804
that's like, yes!
We've invaded...

32:27.539 --> 32:28.440
<i>DC was the majors.</i>

32:28.506 --> 32:30.876
<i>It was one of the two biggies.</i>

32:30.943 --> 32:31.944
DC and marvel.

32:33.012 --> 32:34.512
<i>Del loved the idea of that.</i>

32:35.948 --> 32:37.428
<i>He wanted his influence
to spread out.</i>

32:37.816 --> 32:39.517
<i>He wanted the recognition</i>

32:39.584 --> 32:40.886
that he knows his stuff.

32:42.355 --> 32:44.456
<i>I think there's something
that continues</i>

32:46.292 --> 32:48.493
<i>when he went to second city.</i>

32:53.065 --> 32:55.767
<i>This is one of
Chicago's cultural institutions:</i>

32:55.834 --> 32:57.602
<i>The second city theatre.</i>

32:57.937 --> 33:01.473
The inside of this place
is familiar to a lot of people

33:01.539 --> 33:03.441
who enjoy an evening of comedy.

33:03.808 --> 33:05.978
This bare stage
with its familiar chairs

33:06.045 --> 33:07.545
is a landmark
of American theatre.

33:09.081 --> 33:11.126
And through the years, it has
served as a training ground

33:11.150 --> 33:13.485
for many young, talented
performers

33:13.551 --> 33:14.551
on their way up.

33:16.956 --> 33:19.758
<i>In 1973, second city
was the country's most</i>

33:19.824 --> 33:21.394
<i>famous comedy theater.</i>

33:21.459 --> 33:24.763
<i>And any fanboy can breathlessly
list the legendary comics</i>

33:24.829 --> 33:25.630
<i>that filled that stage.</i>

33:25.697 --> 33:27.266
Ah! That's derry the honky!

33:27.333 --> 33:28.700
<i>Harry the donkey?</i>

33:30.269 --> 33:31.203
<i>But a lesser known fact</i>

33:31.270 --> 33:33.872
<i>was that their director,</i>

33:33.940 --> 33:35.050
<i>like the goddamn
zelig of comedy,</i>

33:35.074 --> 33:36.275
<i>was del close.</i>

33:36.342 --> 33:37.176
Where are we gonna take it...

33:37.243 --> 33:38.710
Yes, we're at the top, right?

33:38.777 --> 33:40.246
<i>Lured by the possibility</i>

33:40.313 --> 33:43.615
<i>of finding a stage for his newly
discovered art form, Harold.</i>

33:43.682 --> 33:46.551
<i>Del agreed to direct the
theatre's scripted sketch shows</i>

33:46.751 --> 33:48.553
but by night, he'd use
the theatre

33:48.620 --> 33:49.821
as his personal laboratory,

33:49.888 --> 33:52.857
developing the Harold
in underground workshops.

33:57.762 --> 33:58.863
<i>Remember, we got style.</i>

34:03.035 --> 34:04.569
<i>Del spends his evenings</i>

34:04.636 --> 34:06.604
<i>at the Wells street
second city theater.</i>

34:08.174 --> 34:09.614
<i>He's doing what some call
impossible.</i>

34:09.641 --> 34:11.609
<i>Close runs a workshop
in improvisation.</i>

34:23.189 --> 34:24.723
<i>Del was the one voice</i>

34:24.789 --> 34:26.029
<i>in the wilderness which is like</i>

34:26.058 --> 34:29.095
improv is a performance medium
in its own right.

34:29.161 --> 34:32.131
People will come just to see
comedy improvisation

34:32.198 --> 34:33.765
and it works by itself.

34:33.832 --> 34:36.701
<i>It's not a means to anything
other than the thing.</i>

34:37.003 --> 34:37.902
<i>Although improvisation</i>

34:37.970 --> 34:40.039
<i>has been established as comedy</i>

34:40.106 --> 34:42.540
<i>close has a greater vision
for it.</i>

34:55.054 --> 34:56.697
<i>That was always
the problem with improvisation.</i>

34:56.721 --> 34:57.990
<i>You can't depend on it.</i>

34:58.057 --> 35:00.592
You don't know if it's
going to be entertainment.

35:00.658 --> 35:01.793
It might just be

35:01.860 --> 35:05.064
oh, look at these people
shitting themselves.

35:05.131 --> 35:08.934
That's always
a distinct possibility.

35:09.201 --> 35:12.071
<i>One of del's
fundamental comic exercises</i>

35:12.138 --> 35:14.806
<i>was "what's the worst thing
that could happen?"</i>

35:15.007 --> 35:16.242
Now let's play with it.

35:16.308 --> 35:19.778
What's the impossibility?
Let's make it possible.

35:20.079 --> 35:22.680
<i>And that's what del used to do
in his workshops.</i>

35:39.999 --> 35:42.134
<i>As an actor the Harold workshop</i>

35:42.201 --> 35:43.735
<i>was really</i>

35:43.802 --> 35:45.938
this liberating force.

35:46.005 --> 35:48.840
<i>And you never know
if it's going to tank</i>

35:48.907 --> 35:50.742
<i>or if it's going to work.</i>

35:50.943 --> 35:52.777
<i>That's what makes it so exciting.</i>

36:00.119 --> 36:01.653
<i>I used to sort of
get by on winking</i>

36:01.719 --> 36:04.423
<i>at the audience kind of
in my behavior,</i>

36:04.490 --> 36:05.890
<i>making like smart jokes.</i>

36:07.493 --> 36:08.836
<i>And del pulled me aside one day
after a show, and said,</i>

36:08.860 --> 36:10.072
"some day you're going to
look in the mirror and say,

36:10.096 --> 36:12.897
'I'm so cute,
and I'm only 45 years old.'"

36:13.232 --> 36:15.733
and it sort of sobered me up,
you know?

36:15.800 --> 36:17.279
<i>It taught me that, you know,
that there was more</i>

36:17.303 --> 36:18.670
<i>to just scoring
with the audience.</i>

36:18.736 --> 36:20.973
<i>It wasn't about
just getting a laugh.</i>

36:28.514 --> 36:29.524
<i>It was putting human nature</i>

36:29.548 --> 36:30.983
<i>up onstage to study it.</i>

36:31.050 --> 36:32.690
<i>To see why people do the shit
that they do</i>

36:34.019 --> 36:35.297
to each other, to people
that you love,

36:35.321 --> 36:36.455
to people that you hate.

36:36.522 --> 36:38.190
Like why do we behave
the way that we do

36:38.257 --> 36:39.257
and exploring that.

36:53.172 --> 36:56.708
<i>He came up with the line
"you have a light within you"</i>

36:56.774 --> 36:57.775
"burn it out."

36:59.345 --> 37:00.745
<i>To me it means, go for it</i>

37:00.812 --> 37:05.717
<i>until you get to the meat
of your soul,</i>

37:05.783 --> 37:07.186
and the heart of your comedy,

37:07.253 --> 37:09.787
and if you fall off the stage,

37:11.823 --> 37:12.823
<i>too bad!</i>

37:20.499 --> 37:23.502
<i>But, unfortunately,
not everybody was so</i>

37:23.569 --> 37:26.172
<i>excited about doing
long-form improvisation</i>

37:26.238 --> 37:27.872
at second city.

37:29.542 --> 37:32.178
<i>This was the source of dispute
between del and Bernie sahlins</i>

37:32.244 --> 37:34.280
<i>who was the long time producer
at second city.</i>

37:34.947 --> 37:37.183
<i>They want you to meet
the man who gave this place</i>

37:37.249 --> 37:39.884
its start and who has been
the driving force

37:40.386 --> 37:41.786
behind it all the way.

37:44.889 --> 37:46.009
<i>His name is Bernard sahlins,</i>

37:47.792 --> 37:49.912
<i>and he's owner, producer,
and sometimes director here.</i>

37:51.363 --> 37:53.898
<i>He is truly second city's
first citizen.</i>

37:54.600 --> 37:57.069
<i>Bernie sahlins
was not at all interested</i>

37:57.136 --> 37:58.903
<i>in doing
long-form improvisation.</i>

37:59.104 --> 38:00.104
<i>Uh why?</i>

38:00.838 --> 38:02.078
They had a formula that worked.

38:03.309 --> 38:05.311
<i>Bernie's formula was as follows:</i>

38:05.377 --> 38:06.711
<i>Drunken audience suggestions</i>

38:06.778 --> 38:08.223
any fantasies at all,
whatever you would like to do.

38:08.247 --> 38:08.981
<i>A whipped cream party.</i>

38:09.048 --> 38:11.317
A whipped cream party.

38:12.884 --> 38:13.885
<i>Plus backstage planning</i>

38:13.953 --> 38:14.653
<i>three-mile island,</i>

38:14.719 --> 38:17.022
invasion of normandy,

38:17.089 --> 38:18.691
and Catherine the great,
hubba hubba.

38:18.756 --> 38:20.192
<i>Plus
weeks and weeks of rehearsal</i>

38:20.259 --> 38:21.193
rehearsal. Rehearsal.

38:21.260 --> 38:22.661
Rehearsal.

38:22.727 --> 38:24.129
<i>Until all the mistakes</i>

38:24.196 --> 38:26.966
<i>and failed experiments
were buffed away,</i>

38:27.032 --> 38:29.377
<i>revealing a show that even the
boys from marketing could love.</i>

38:29.401 --> 38:33.038
It was money,
we bring in regular audiences.

38:33.105 --> 38:34.273
What they did was very safe.

38:35.941 --> 38:36.575
<i>Improvisation, especially,
in the early days</i>

38:36.642 --> 38:37.642
<i>was not safe.</i>

38:42.780 --> 38:45.084
<i>I had a fundamental
disagreement about the uses</i>

38:45.150 --> 38:46.552
<i>of improvisation.</i>

38:46.619 --> 38:50.089
There are others, led by del,
that feel that the process

38:50.155 --> 38:52.091
itself had some
mysterious beauty.

38:52.424 --> 38:55.361
<i>I think if you're going to see
improvisers,</i>

38:55.427 --> 38:58.097
<i>often enough, you'll see that
half of their audience</i>

38:58.163 --> 39:00.099
<i>are other improvisers.</i>

39:00.165 --> 39:02.368
Sometimes it's brilliant,
and most of the time,

39:02.434 --> 39:05.371
by my lights,
it's not brilliant.

39:07.006 --> 39:08.149
<i>I remember Bernie allowed del</i>

39:08.173 --> 39:09.508
<i>to run his workshops,</i>

39:10.943 --> 39:13.023
but you're not going to
screw with the stage on that.

39:14.013 --> 39:16.093
<i>The notion of improvisation
as a performance art form</i>

39:17.016 --> 39:18.016
that's preposterous.

39:19.184 --> 39:20.918
<i>The big no.</i>

39:20.986 --> 39:23.989
<i>Ten years later, during
the writing of "wasteland",</i>

39:24.056 --> 39:25.056
<i>it still stung.</i>

39:26.392 --> 39:27.402
<i>So del took his anger
toward all the bosses</i>

39:27.426 --> 39:28.860
<i>who had ever shut him down</i>

39:28.926 --> 39:31.530
<i>turned them into one,
vaguely anti-semitic.</i>

39:31.597 --> 39:34.366
<i>Bernie look-a-like,
and named him lash larue</i>

39:34.433 --> 39:36.935
<i>after a cowboy he worked for
in his teens.</i>

39:39.371 --> 39:41.873
<i>But like all del's creations,</i>

39:41.940 --> 39:43.208
<i>once brought into existence,</i>

39:45.210 --> 39:47.112
<i>they tend not to stay put.</i>

39:47.513 --> 39:50.015
<i>Well, howdy, shithead.</i>

39:50.349 --> 39:51.626
<i>Hear you're having trouble
with your boss.</i>

39:51.650 --> 39:54.320
Lemme guess, he's a moron,
and you're a genius.

39:57.156 --> 39:58.657
He's not a bad guy.

39:58.724 --> 39:59.725
I like him.

39:59.792 --> 40:01.960
He's just, you know,

40:02.027 --> 40:04.196
greedy, and intrusive, and...

40:04.263 --> 40:05.731
It's his candy store.

40:05.798 --> 40:06.999
<i>Lemme ask you something.</i>

40:07.066 --> 40:09.401
And I know I'm just a big ol'
dumb fake cowboy,

40:09.468 --> 40:11.437
<i>but what is your beef
with Bernie?</i>

40:11.503 --> 40:14.173
I thought you guys just wanted
a couple of yuks.

40:14.239 --> 40:15.974
Well, to the general public

40:16.041 --> 40:17.676
it's a trivial little
disagreement.

40:17.743 --> 40:20.245
But to us, it's a great crisis
of artistic vision!

40:20.312 --> 40:23.315
<i>Bernie's conception
of improvisation? Oh boy!</i>

40:23.382 --> 40:25.951
True improvisation
demands your whole mind.

40:26.251 --> 40:27.986
We're not reproducing
human behavior!

40:28.053 --> 40:29.373
We're transforming it
so that it's

40:29.755 --> 40:31.123
meaning appears.

40:31.190 --> 40:32.691
<i>Well, shit, hell's mouse.</i>

40:32.758 --> 40:35.194
<i>Hey Trisha? Can you
get a babysitter?</i>

40:35.260 --> 40:37.696
Del close is putting on
one of his meaning shows.

40:37.763 --> 40:41.200
Uh, here we're going to see
human behavior transformed

40:41.266 --> 40:43.202
hey do we get a free diaper
with this show

40:43.268 --> 40:45.304
from when we shit our pants
cuz of all the meaning?

40:45.371 --> 40:49.274
Do me a favor? Just
pretend this isn't bullshit

40:52.010 --> 40:53.290
busting your chops,
buddy, rough.

40:53.579 --> 40:54.713
To del close.

40:55.447 --> 40:56.881
Worst employee.

40:56.949 --> 40:59.884
All that fancy talk, still can't
put on a show worth a shit.

41:01.453 --> 41:03.422
Goddammit!

41:05.923 --> 41:07.426
Tastes like
a lollipop's butthole.

41:12.897 --> 41:15.367
<i>Bernie always thought
that del was crazy.</i>

41:15.434 --> 41:18.737
To expect people to see shows
where wholly 100%

41:18.804 --> 41:19.705
improvised.

41:19.772 --> 41:21.206
<i>The actors, on the other end,</i>

41:21.273 --> 41:23.976
<i>you know, most of them
loved improvisation,</i>

41:24.042 --> 41:25.411
<i>and doing it in a long-form.</i>

41:25.477 --> 41:27.246
<i>They can see it all paying off.</i>

41:27.446 --> 41:28.814
Sister,
is this really necessary?

41:28.881 --> 41:31.483
I was told, I could just come in
and get some antibiotics.

41:31.550 --> 41:34.386
Oh really, you were just trying
to get some shots and pills?

41:34.453 --> 41:35.920
Oh really?
Well, who told you that?

41:37.322 --> 41:38.390
Just this guy...

41:38.457 --> 41:39.834
Just this guy?
I wanna know what guy.

41:39.858 --> 41:41.469
- You know, just a guy!
- No, I wanna know what guy

41:41.493 --> 41:42.493
told you that!

41:44.530 --> 41:47.132
This guy! He told me!

41:47.199 --> 41:49.368
<i>It's the greatest
job any young actor can have</i>

41:49.568 --> 41:51.346
<i>cause there's no place like that
where you get to improvise.</i>

41:51.370 --> 41:53.572
<i>There's something about that
technique that makes you</i>

41:53.639 --> 41:55.374
<i>really like a sponge.</i>

41:55.441 --> 41:57.561
<i>You really do... you try to
absorb everything you can.</i>

41:59.111 --> 42:00.622
<i>I'd like you to
take a look at this picture</i>

42:00.646 --> 42:01.646
and tell me...

42:02.448 --> 42:05.083
John belushi is a prime example

42:05.150 --> 42:06.150
of del's work.

42:07.152 --> 42:09.421
There was serious danger
on the stage.

42:10.856 --> 42:11.990
But it was hilarious.

42:12.057 --> 42:14.226
This fish comes from one
of the most polluted

42:14.293 --> 42:16.028
streams in the United States.

42:16.094 --> 42:18.130
That fish was actually
killed by pollution?

42:18.330 --> 42:20.466
Well, not directly, Tommy,
see the fish crawled out

42:20.532 --> 42:22.201
of the water and was hit
by a car.

42:23.869 --> 42:27.172
<i>He's a very good example
of the kind of approach</i>

42:27.239 --> 42:28.607
<i>that del would expect.</i>

42:28.674 --> 42:31.210
<i>That quality of walking
the tightrope.</i>

42:34.279 --> 42:35.547
And just when it seemed

42:35.614 --> 42:38.217
the power balance might be
tipping in del's favor

42:38.283 --> 42:41.453
live from New York,
it's Saturday night!

42:57.536 --> 42:59.137
<i>The director can</i>

43:00.239 --> 43:01.239
set the goals,

43:02.508 --> 43:05.477
work with the actors,
and train them to some extent

43:05.544 --> 43:06.544
okay?

43:07.379 --> 43:10.015
But then, when
push comes to shove.

43:11.216 --> 43:12.416
<i>I'm the one who stayed behind.</i>

43:14.219 --> 43:16.339
<i>And we're ready to go on to
make films and television.</i>

43:17.656 --> 43:20.292
<i>Without his most
prized cast members,</i>

43:20.359 --> 43:22.027
<i>uncertainty took hold.</i>

43:22.661 --> 43:24.196
<i>What if the excitement
of the Harold</i>

43:24.263 --> 43:26.265
<i>had been more about
the brilliant talent</i>

43:26.331 --> 43:27.599
<i>than the form itself?</i>

43:29.101 --> 43:31.603
<i>What if the form itself,
god forbid</i>

43:35.340 --> 43:36.575
<i>fucking sucked?</i>

43:41.747 --> 43:43.382
<i>Satchel</i>

43:44.483 --> 43:45.250
<i>damn!</i>

43:45.317 --> 43:46.986
<i>General.</i>

43:47.052 --> 43:48.492
<i>It was a very
frustrating experience.</i>

43:50.122 --> 43:51.842
<i>Those were really years
of struggle for del.</i>

43:55.360 --> 43:57.596
Well, he'd scream at people
or belittle them.

44:05.671 --> 44:07.306
<i>Del would self-destruct,</i>

44:07.372 --> 44:09.308
<i>or od or disappear...</i>

44:09.374 --> 44:10.374
<i>All the time.</i>

44:11.343 --> 44:13.211
I'm sorry, you know, like, uh...

44:14.379 --> 44:15.619
That's... am I ratting him out?

44:15.681 --> 44:17.115
<i>- No!</i>
- Is everyone...

44:17.182 --> 44:17.716
Everyone's ratting him out <i>yes!</i>

44:17.783 --> 44:18.783
Okay, good.

44:21.186 --> 44:22.430
<i>The wheels were
coming off del's rebel act,</i>

44:22.454 --> 44:24.856
<i>and Bernie's Patience
had worn thin.</i>

44:24.923 --> 44:28.427
<i>He needed del, but he no longer
wanted to see, hear,</i>

44:28.493 --> 44:29.661
<i>or smell him.</i>

44:33.565 --> 44:35.567
<i>So he decided to export him.</i>

44:36.635 --> 44:39.204
<i>Canada, the endless surprise.</i>

44:39.271 --> 44:43.508
<i>♪ Magical, we want to see,
come on up ♪</i>

44:44.743 --> 44:45.410
Come on up.

44:45.477 --> 44:47.512
♪ Come on up! ♪

44:55.253 --> 44:57.556
<i>And so, del found
himself banished</i>

44:57.623 --> 45:00.225
<i>to second city's new Canadian
outpost</i>

45:00.292 --> 45:01.627
<i>to direct a group of unknowns.</i>

45:01.693 --> 45:04.196
Okay, this is
the great white north

45:04.262 --> 45:05.564
okay, on the map.

45:05.631 --> 45:08.667
Now here is a different color
cuz it's like u.S.A.

45:08.734 --> 45:11.370
They got like a
pimple right here

45:11.436 --> 45:13.372
- it's Florida.
- It's Florida.

45:16.775 --> 45:18.310
<i>Martin short was in that cast.</i>

45:18.377 --> 45:22.280
<i>Catherine O'Hara, Andrea Martin,
Dave Thomas, John candy.</i>

45:23.515 --> 45:25.384
<i>It was interesting...
The Toronto group</i>

45:25.450 --> 45:26.685
<i>versus second city in Chicago</i>

45:26.752 --> 45:29.221
the behavior issues were
quite different, you know?

45:29.287 --> 45:30.567
Our cast started
having families.

45:30.622 --> 45:32.257
<i>They were settled down.</i>

45:32.324 --> 45:35.160
<i>There wasn't outrageous issues
with drinking or drugs.</i>

45:35.527 --> 45:37.763
<i>And del, he was going through
a lot of stuff,</i>

45:37.829 --> 45:39.297
<i>you know, personally.</i>

45:39.364 --> 45:42.467
<i>I mean, he was well-documented
about his addictions.</i>

45:42.534 --> 45:44.569
<i>So you never knew
which del was going to show up.</i>

45:46.405 --> 45:47.815
<i>Had you heard
about del before Toronto?</i>

45:47.839 --> 45:48.839
Oh yeah!

45:48.874 --> 45:50.085
He was infamous
before we saw him

45:50.109 --> 45:52.210
they said, you know,
he's out of his mind.

45:52.711 --> 45:55.014
<i>He was a delicate basket of eggs</i>

45:55.081 --> 45:57.516
<i>that were ready to break
at any moment.</i>

45:59.217 --> 46:01.520
<i>He was definitely going through
his crazy period,</i>

46:01.586 --> 46:02.586
<i>you know what I mean?</i>

46:54.873 --> 46:56.541
<i>Del, del! Whoa, whoa!</i>

46:56.608 --> 46:58.577
<i>Hey! Put that thing down, man!</i>

47:02.547 --> 47:04.449
Get a hold of yourself, dude!

47:05.517 --> 47:07.619
Where ya going with this
comic book thing?

47:07.686 --> 47:08.796
I mean, what happened to those

47:08.820 --> 47:11.456
secrets of comedy
you were writing, huh?

47:11.523 --> 47:13.759
Did ya drop them while you
were reaching for your bong?

47:14.160 --> 47:15.160
Well...

47:15.694 --> 47:17.796
It became decadent right away...

47:23.668 --> 47:25.904
You gotta channel your follies
and stupidity

47:25.972 --> 47:27.439
and use it for comedy.

47:29.108 --> 47:31.610
<i>A short time ago, the manager
was having trouble</i>

47:31.676 --> 47:32.911
<i>with the same limousine.</i>

47:32.979 --> 47:34.080
<i>He had a...</i>

47:34.147 --> 47:36.615
I have a hard time
being a person too.

47:37.482 --> 47:38.483
No shit, del!

47:39.185 --> 47:41.620
No shit...

47:46.591 --> 47:48.161
<i>So one of the early nights,</i>

47:48.227 --> 47:51.363
<i>when del had come,
we were doing workshops</i>

47:51.429 --> 47:52.429
<i>he said,</i>

47:53.365 --> 47:54.866
and he gets up on stage,
takes over.

48:01.207 --> 48:02.507
<i>Now this was a story del had</i>

48:02.574 --> 48:06.411
had already told us that this
was how his father died.

48:18.557 --> 48:19.758
<i>So...</i>

48:19.825 --> 48:21.536
Okay, we're going
to do a scene now, Dave, where

48:21.560 --> 48:25.664
<i>you will play the doctor
that comes and tells me</i>

48:25.864 --> 48:28.900
<i>that my father died
from drinking sulfuric acid.</i>

48:29.734 --> 48:31.503
<i>I looked at him, and said,</i>

48:31.570 --> 48:32.838
I'm not doing that.

48:34.706 --> 48:36.741
<i>That's not a good joke.</i>

48:38.244 --> 48:40.745
<i>I think del was always
interested in making</i>

48:40.812 --> 48:42.347
<i>the audience gasp,</i>

48:42.414 --> 48:44.449
<i>and that would be equivalent
to a laugh.</i>

48:44.649 --> 48:45.917
Which I never believed.

48:46.751 --> 48:48.353
<i>They wanted to laugh.</i>

48:48.420 --> 48:49.597
<i>You have a responsibility
to that audience.</i>

48:49.621 --> 48:52.624
And without them,
you got nothing, you know?

48:52.824 --> 48:55.493
You're a... you're a madman
on a street corner,

48:55.760 --> 48:58.496
you know, raving at passers-by.

48:58.763 --> 49:01.366
<i>And he was a madman,
there's no denying that.</i>

49:12.577 --> 49:13.577
It got worse.

49:17.016 --> 49:19.551
<i>Iconic actor,
John belushi, died today</i>

49:19.618 --> 49:22.487
<i>at the rented hotel bungalow
in Hollywood Hills.</i>

49:22.554 --> 49:23.966
<i>Authorities say that
cause of death is believed</i>

49:23.990 --> 49:25.790
<i>to have been a heart attack.</i>

49:25.857 --> 49:28.827
<i>Fire department medics say
they were called to the hotel</i>

49:29.028 --> 49:30.762
<i>where they found belushi
unconscious...</i>

49:40.672 --> 49:43.708
<i>One evening, we heard
del's booming voice</i>

49:43.909 --> 49:45.710
and he had a real booming voice,

49:45.777 --> 49:48.480
<i>screaming,
in the little alleyway</i>

49:48.546 --> 49:50.283
<i>behind the theater.</i>

49:50.349 --> 49:51.883
<i>It was probably
ten degrees above zero.</i>

49:51.951 --> 49:55.553
<i>He walks in his stocking feet,
all the way down Jarvis street.</i>

49:55.620 --> 49:56.755
And he came backstage

49:56.821 --> 49:59.457
by this time, we see Andrew
backing up.

50:00.326 --> 50:02.962
And del moving at him,
trying to punch him.

50:03.162 --> 50:05.630
And he started
throwing punches at me,

50:05.965 --> 50:08.433
and then John candy
got inbetween us.

50:10.602 --> 50:11.404
<i>And he's so big
that del can't reach over him</i>

50:11.469 --> 50:13.973
<i>punching Andrew,</i>

50:14.040 --> 50:15.520
<i>and Marty gets up
'cause he hated del,</i>

50:15.573 --> 50:16.375
<i>and sanctimoniously
closes the door</i>

50:16.441 --> 50:18.443
<i>like we don't need to see this.</i>

50:20.246 --> 50:21.957
<i>Del was screaming about how
Andrew had betrayed him.</i>

50:21.981 --> 50:23.015
"You demon!"

50:23.082 --> 50:24.649
"You Judas!"

50:24.716 --> 50:25.994
And then there was
a bit of a pause,

50:26.018 --> 50:27.018
"you cheeser!"

50:27.886 --> 50:29.788
He yelled out, "you cheeser!"

50:29.854 --> 50:31.157
He ran out of ammo

50:31.223 --> 50:34.060
at sort of the demonic level
of things to describe

50:34.126 --> 50:35.660
Andrew as, and

50:35.860 --> 50:37.595
tripled out with "cheeser".

50:37.662 --> 50:38.998
So that's our show for today.

50:39.764 --> 50:40.832
So good day.

50:42.467 --> 50:44.146
<i>To me, it was just like,
he's fucking nuts.</i>

50:44.170 --> 50:46.638
<i>We gotta get him on a plane
as fast as we can,</i>

50:48.140 --> 50:49.684
<i>so that he's no longer
our responsibility.</i>

50:49.708 --> 50:52.544
<i>Bernie and Joyce Sloan
met him at the airport,</i>

50:52.610 --> 50:53.980
took him straight to

50:54.879 --> 50:57.582
some psychiatric ward,
and he was

50:57.782 --> 50:59.584
an inpatient there for awhile.

51:26.878 --> 51:28.981
<i>He checked himself
into cook county</i>

51:29.048 --> 51:30.349
<i>a psychiatric wing.</i>

51:33.685 --> 51:35.563
<i>You know, he was sort of still
being very active,</i>

51:35.587 --> 51:38.857
<i>as if he was still directing
the show from the psych ward.</i>

51:39.091 --> 51:41.793
<i>And he would call in,
and he'd throw out ideas.</i>

51:41.860 --> 51:43.728
<i>With the hope that he was going
to come back</i>

51:43.795 --> 51:46.132
and finish the show off,
which he didn't.

51:48.067 --> 51:50.869
<i>Bernie kept del
around for the next few years</i>

51:51.070 --> 51:53.738
<i>but his addictions and combative
nature eventually</i>

51:53.805 --> 51:55.540
<i>got him fired for good.</i>

51:57.143 --> 51:58.810
<i>So without a stage,
or coherent creator,</i>

51:58.877 --> 52:01.147
<i>the art form called "Harold"
reached a dead end.</i>

52:25.104 --> 52:26.704
<i>People like to talk
about the beauty</i>

52:26.771 --> 52:28.340
<i>of the creative process.</i>

52:28.407 --> 52:30.842
<i>They compare it to
the depths of the ocean,</i>

52:31.043 --> 52:32.844
<i>or a gently flowing river.</i>

52:35.548 --> 52:37.049
<i>But if you really
need a metaphor</i>

52:37.116 --> 52:38.636
<i>here's the one del
kept coming back to:</i>

52:41.253 --> 52:42.253
<i>It's a sewer.</i>

52:46.724 --> 52:48.127
<i>The thing about horror stories</i>

52:48.194 --> 52:51.997
<i>they usually take you into
a dark place,</i>

52:52.730 --> 52:54.699
<i>and then they would take you
back out again.</i>

52:55.000 --> 52:56.035
We didn't do that.

52:57.303 --> 52:59.604
We'd take you to a dark place,
and then say bye,

52:59.804 --> 53:00.872
<i>and leave you there.</i>

53:03.875 --> 53:05.195
<i>We wouldn't tell you
how something</i>

53:06.678 --> 53:08.078
<i>ended somtimes.
We wouldn't tell you</i>

53:08.414 --> 53:09.414
how to feel about it.

53:10.715 --> 53:11.850
<i>And so...</i>

53:13.352 --> 53:15.032
<i>Most of our readership
didn't quite get it.</i>

53:17.156 --> 53:19.158
<i>Oh, this is the one,
this letter.</i>

53:19.858 --> 53:20.960
Dear Mr. Close,

53:21.026 --> 53:22.228
what is the point?

53:22.294 --> 53:24.230
Am I interested in what
del close puts down

53:24.296 --> 53:25.663
his underwear?

53:25.730 --> 53:27.170
<i>To be honest,
I couldn't give a toss.</i>

53:27.199 --> 53:31.103
You are a boring old hippie,
and I claim my five pounds.

53:33.005 --> 53:34.249
He didn't say anything about me.

53:34.273 --> 53:36.808
Exposes a middle-age neurotic
with no ideas.

53:38.611 --> 53:40.745
<i>Trying to reinvent everything</i>

53:40.812 --> 53:41.812
<i>every eight pages,</i>

53:42.982 --> 53:44.542
every twelve issues
gets a little tough.

53:45.451 --> 53:46.794
<i>At that point,
it was a question of</i>

53:46.818 --> 53:48.187
<i>do we keep on
writing the stories?</i>

53:49.588 --> 53:50.722
<i>The question is this...</i>

53:50.788 --> 53:52.508
How do we achieve the goals
we have in mind?

53:53.058 --> 53:55.927
<i>Huh? I have to toss a few coins,</i>

53:56.195 --> 53:58.964
and write a bunch of lines
on a blackboard.

53:59.031 --> 54:00.065
<i>Okay, I, uh,</i>

54:00.132 --> 54:01.866
I think I'm going to
excuse myself

54:01.934 --> 54:03.768
hold that.

54:12.677 --> 54:14.313
<i>What is it?</i>

54:14.380 --> 54:15.557
<i>This hexagram
looks like a breakthrough.</i>

54:15.581 --> 54:17.782
As a swollen river
breaks through its dykes,

54:17.849 --> 54:20.252
this refers to a time when
inferior people

54:20.885 --> 54:22.521
will gradually
begin to disappear.

54:22.588 --> 54:23.422
Oh.

54:23.489 --> 54:24.649
Your influence is on the way.

54:26.091 --> 54:29.061
Won't be easy.

54:29.128 --> 54:30.895
I think we're
on the right track.

54:36.402 --> 54:37.869
<i>One thing about del was</i>

54:37.937 --> 54:41.873
<i>he found rock bottom an oldly
inspiring place to be.</i>

54:43.042 --> 54:44.210
<i>And he wasn't alone.</i>

54:45.910 --> 54:47.779
<i>They'd been doing
comedy at college,</i>

54:49.248 --> 54:50.528
<i>on the radio
and some live shows.</i>

54:51.250 --> 54:52.961
And I thought, maybe,
I can do this for a living.

54:52.985 --> 54:55.853
<i>The only place I knew where
people were doing it</i>

54:55.920 --> 54:57.456
<i>was second city, and I thought,</i>

54:57.523 --> 54:58.934
<i>I would go, just see
what happens there,</i>

54:58.958 --> 55:01.926
<i>under the guise of doing
a news report</i>

55:01.994 --> 55:04.029
<i>for my college radio station.</i>

55:05.698 --> 55:08.000
<i>I called and got an interview
with Joyce Sloane,</i>

55:08.067 --> 55:10.135
<i>the denmother of second city.</i>

55:10.336 --> 55:13.339
She told me a lot of, sort of,
magical, legend stories

55:13.405 --> 55:16.141
about the actors who
had been on the stage there.

55:16.408 --> 55:19.178
<i>John belushi, he came
to our door and he knocked,</i>

55:19.245 --> 55:21.313
<i>and he said, "I want to get
on that stage", and we</i>

55:21.879 --> 55:24.749
looked at him, and said,
"you get up there, mister!"

55:25.284 --> 55:28.786
<i>I think Joyce wanted to tell me
the legend, you know?</i>

55:29.121 --> 55:30.922
<i>But I think, what
she didn't realize</i>

55:30.990 --> 55:32.924
<i>was what I wanted to hear was,</i>

55:32.992 --> 55:33.993
you know,

55:34.059 --> 55:35.594
"they sucked
when we first saw them",

55:35.661 --> 55:38.397
"they were terrible", and then,
"they worked really really hard

55:38.464 --> 55:39.464
for a long time,

55:40.232 --> 55:41.392
and they slowly got better...

55:43.135 --> 55:44.655
You know? That's what I wanted
to hear.

55:45.938 --> 55:48.040
<i>And I walked out thinking,
I can't do this</i>

55:48.107 --> 55:50.309
<i>'cause I'm just not that great.</i>

55:58.684 --> 56:00.462
<i>I walked down the street
to Barbara's bookstore,</i>

56:00.486 --> 56:02.154
<i>and this guy walks in,</i>

56:02.221 --> 56:04.856
and he's talking to the girl
at the, um,

56:05.057 --> 56:07.026
desk, and she's calling him del.

56:07.326 --> 56:08.836
<i>I didn't know
what del close looked like,</i>

56:08.860 --> 56:12.864
<i>but I'd seen his name
in the program of second city.</i>

56:13.432 --> 56:14.600
I walk over, I go,

56:14.667 --> 56:17.069
"are you del close?",
and he goes, "yeah."

56:17.136 --> 56:19.804
And I go, "well, I just
interviewed Joyce Sloan,

56:20.072 --> 56:24.176
I'm here, can I interview you
about second city and stuff?"

56:24.443 --> 56:26.911
And he said, "that's great!
I'd love to."

56:27.313 --> 56:29.881
<i>And he explained that he had
just quit second city</i>

56:29.948 --> 56:31.116
<i>the day before,</i>

56:32.884 --> 56:33.686
<i>and he had just quit cocaine,
I think, a few weeks before,</i>

56:33.752 --> 56:37.222
<i>and he's changing his life now,</i>

56:37.423 --> 56:40.025
<i>and he would love
to talk about that.</i>

56:40.459 --> 56:42.127
<i>One, two, test, test.</i>

56:42.361 --> 56:43.861
<i>Okay, um, Bob odenkirk here.</i>

56:45.964 --> 56:47.666
<i>Got some really
important questions here.</i>

56:47.733 --> 56:50.369
<i>So we walk over
to his little apartment</i>

56:50.436 --> 56:51.980
<i>across from second city,
and at the time,</i>

56:52.004 --> 56:53.972
<i>they had a window
that was busted out.</i>

57:02.081 --> 57:03.949
And this is February,
in Chicago.

57:04.149 --> 57:06.952
So, the fucking, freezing

57:07.152 --> 57:11.123
cold wind blowing
in that little... that window

57:11.190 --> 57:12.857
the whole time
we're sitting there.

57:19.965 --> 57:22.000
<i>He had stopped hard drugs.</i>

57:22.067 --> 57:23.868
He had stopped coke and heroine.

57:24.536 --> 57:28.340
<i>He went to this coven,
this witch gathering.</i>

57:29.174 --> 57:30.875
'Cause he was a witch, you know?

57:32.778 --> 57:35.059
<i>And he did a ceremony to get
rid of his cocaine addiction,</i>

57:35.547 --> 57:36.881
which he said worked.

57:38.550 --> 57:40.870
<i>I mean, I don't know that stuff,
I'm a kid from naperville.</i>

57:41.520 --> 57:44.523
But if he says he quite coke,
and he did it by going to

57:44.590 --> 57:46.091
a witch ceremony

57:46.158 --> 57:47.892
<i>then I believe him.</i>

57:55.134 --> 57:57.102
<i>The crazy thing is that</i>

57:57.169 --> 57:59.037
<i>I walked out of del's place</i>

58:00.038 --> 58:04.243
so excited about doing comedy

58:04.309 --> 58:07.279
and being in show business.

58:08.180 --> 58:11.083
<i>And it was not through
any overt effort</i>

58:11.150 --> 58:12.818
though, I promise you.

58:12.885 --> 58:14.529
<i>He didn't sit around and go,
you should do this!</i>

58:14.553 --> 58:17.022
<i>I mean, he was just talking
about his life.</i>

58:18.791 --> 58:20.502
<i>Talking about all these
things he was dealing with</i>

58:20.526 --> 58:23.295
<i>personally and professionally,
and it made it seem real.</i>

58:23.362 --> 58:27.065
<i>It made it seem possible,
and it made it seem amazing.</i>

58:27.132 --> 58:32.004
<i>But also I wouldn't put it
past myself for thinking,</i>

58:32.070 --> 58:34.339
if he can do all he did

58:34.540 --> 58:38.076
and still have his brain intact,

58:38.610 --> 58:42.548
imagine what I could do if I'm
not doing cocaine or heroin.

58:43.582 --> 58:47.052
You know, I might even
have some money left over

58:47.119 --> 58:48.320
to fix the window.

58:50.322 --> 58:51.523
<i>Well, I'll end this for you.</i>

58:51.590 --> 58:54.126
<i>No, no, no I wanna...</i>

58:55.494 --> 58:58.297
<i>Window or no window,
del was ready to get back</i>

58:58.363 --> 58:59.531
<i>to work on the "Harold".</i>

59:00.265 --> 59:02.301
<i>But where to begin?</i>

59:03.235 --> 59:04.235
Hello!

59:05.404 --> 59:06.672
<i>I was an improviser</i>

59:06.738 --> 59:09.308
<i>that was desperate
to learn more.</i>

59:09.541 --> 59:12.244
I was bored. I felt like it
was the same old jokes.

59:12.311 --> 59:13.345
The same old tricks.

59:14.813 --> 59:17.382
And so I sought out del, because
I wanted to see if there was

59:17.449 --> 59:18.729
something I could steal
from him.

59:21.119 --> 59:24.056
<i>My first meeting with del
was a disaster.</i>

59:24.456 --> 59:27.125
<i>It was Halloween. I saw him
at an art gallery,</i>

59:27.192 --> 59:29.261
<i>and I went with the plan
that I would talk to him</i>

59:29.328 --> 59:30.872
<i>and see if I could get
him to teach a class.</i>

59:30.896 --> 59:32.631
And he was wearing
these witches' robes,

59:32.698 --> 59:36.235
and he was invoking demons,
and doing this very scary

59:36.301 --> 59:37.836
invocation of gods.

59:39.404 --> 59:41.044
<i>And I went up to him
afterwards, and said,</i>

59:41.073 --> 59:43.475
<i>"you have a lot of nerve
for invoking demons</i>

59:43.542 --> 59:45.344
<i>with all these people
in the room."</i>

59:45.410 --> 59:47.422
<i>And he said, "I protected the
building", and I was like,</i>

59:47.446 --> 59:51.149
and I just walked out in a huff,
and then I was like "oh god."

59:51.350 --> 59:54.419
There was your meeting with
del close and look what you did

59:54.653 --> 59:58.590
<i>then a couple weeks later there
was del, sitting in the theater.</i>

59:59.358 --> 1:00:00.960
<i>And I thought, well,
I had heard rumors</i>

1:00:01.026 --> 1:00:01.827
<i>that he was always high,
and that he doesn't</i>

1:00:01.894 --> 1:00:03.428
<i>remember people.</i>

1:00:05.030 --> 1:00:06.441
<i>I figured, he's not going to
remember me.</i>

1:00:06.465 --> 1:00:08.176
So I said, "hey, how'd you like
to make two hundred bucks

1:00:08.200 --> 1:00:09.200
in pot?"

1:00:10.369 --> 1:00:12.037
And he was like, "hm,
what do I gotta do?"

1:00:13.338 --> 1:00:15.173
And I said, "just teach one
three hour class",

1:00:15.240 --> 1:00:16.240
and he was like,

1:00:16.842 --> 1:00:18.143
"can I do anything I want?"

1:00:18.210 --> 1:00:21.213
And I said, "yeah," and he said,
"can I invoke demons?"

1:00:22.915 --> 1:00:24.692
<i>So he taught a class,
and he revealed the secrets</i>

1:00:24.716 --> 1:00:26.485
<i>of the universe to us.</i>

1:00:26.552 --> 1:00:28.029
<i>And we talked, and I said,
"I just feel like there's</i>

1:00:28.053 --> 1:00:30.222
<i>something more for
improvisation."</i>

1:00:30.289 --> 1:00:31.289
<i>And he said, "well,</i>

1:00:32.257 --> 1:00:33.668
perhaps you're not a twit
after all."

1:00:33.692 --> 1:00:34.970
And then he told me, he had
been working on this thing

1:00:34.994 --> 1:00:37.162
since the 60s when he was
directing the committee

1:00:37.229 --> 1:00:38.497
called Harold.

1:00:38.564 --> 1:00:39.909
Which was basically unteachable
and unplayable,

1:00:39.933 --> 1:00:42.634
but if I would like to shut down
my little game theater

1:00:42.701 --> 1:00:44.636
perhaps we could find a way
to make it work

1:00:44.836 --> 1:00:47.472
and change the face
of improvisational comedy,

1:00:47.539 --> 1:00:48.907
and I said, "yes please!"

1:00:58.750 --> 1:01:00.152
<i>Here's the funny thing
about del.</i>

1:01:00.218 --> 1:01:04.423
I mean, he was like this legend,
he was definitely brilliant.

1:01:05.691 --> 1:01:08.627
<i>But he could also be a little
bit of a baby sometimes.</i>

1:01:08.694 --> 1:01:11.697
<i>And after the end of his run
at second city,</i>

1:01:11.763 --> 1:01:14.433
there was still a serious
argument going on

1:01:14.499 --> 1:01:17.669
about... is improv
even a performance

1:01:17.736 --> 1:01:18.736
uh, form?

1:01:20.272 --> 1:01:22.112
<i>It wasn't a polished,
regular second city show.</i>

1:01:22.507 --> 1:01:24.309
It was a road to nowhere.

1:01:24.810 --> 1:01:27.512
The only thing you could get
out of improv at that time

1:01:27.579 --> 1:01:30.115
was to get better
at doing improv.

1:01:31.017 --> 1:01:32.517
<i>I think he worried
that he was wrong,</i>

1:01:32.584 --> 1:01:37.222
<i>and maybe a big group of people
onstage just making stuff up</i>

1:01:37.656 --> 1:01:39.725
<i>really is a trainwreck.</i>

1:01:40.659 --> 1:01:44.196
<i>Like, the thing is that
second city worked for awhile.</i>

1:01:44.396 --> 1:01:45.664
<i>Was it an accident, you know?</i>

1:01:46.431 --> 1:01:47.599
<i>Did it just happen?</i>

1:01:49.167 --> 1:01:51.737
<i>It's easy to question
the validity of your art form.</i>

1:01:51.803 --> 1:01:54.573
<i>If it only works when
bill Murray and gilda radner</i>

1:01:54.640 --> 1:01:55.640
<i>do it.</i>

1:01:56.943 --> 1:01:58.586
<i>Charna saw that the real proof
of the Harold would be</i>

1:01:58.610 --> 1:01:59.610
<i>if it was teachable.</i>

1:02:00.612 --> 1:02:02.081
<i>We thought, okay,</i>

1:02:02.147 --> 1:02:03.049
<i>we really have to find a way
to train anyone</i>

1:02:03.116 --> 1:02:04.416
<i>that comes through the doors.</i>

1:02:06.052 --> 1:02:08.292
<i>You know, I said to him,
"I'm asking you to just listen,</i>"

1:02:08.453 --> 1:02:10.489
<i>and collaborate,
and work together,</i>

1:02:10.555 --> 1:02:11.857
<i>and I'm going to take you idea,</i>

1:02:11.923 --> 1:02:13.525
<i>"and I'm gonna
make it brilliant."</i>

1:02:14.493 --> 1:02:15.761
<i>He just trusted me, and</i>

1:02:16.495 --> 1:02:17.729
opened up and let it in.

1:02:22.601 --> 1:02:24.703
<i>Charna really believed in del,</i>

1:02:25.570 --> 1:02:28.173
<i>but she saw that you need a form</i>

1:02:28.540 --> 1:02:32.577
for groups of people to use
as a guide rail onstage,

1:02:32.844 --> 1:02:35.514
so it doesn't turn
into a giant mess.

1:02:37.649 --> 1:02:39.317
<i>And that was when it hooked.</i>

1:02:41.020 --> 1:02:43.388
<i>That was when they cracked
this form called</i>

1:02:43.455 --> 1:02:44.623
<i>"the teaching Harold".</i>

1:02:44.690 --> 1:02:46.101
Yeah, you could probably
use graphics if you need,

1:02:46.125 --> 1:02:46.725
<i>- we are going to...</i>
- You could show... yeah, yeah,

1:02:46.792 --> 1:02:47.792
perfect!

1:02:50.295 --> 1:02:52.597
<i>All of this starts
with a one-word suggestion.</i>

1:02:52.664 --> 1:02:54.633
Okay, we need a theme

1:02:54.700 --> 1:02:56.601
<i>something meaty
we can tear apart.</i>

1:02:58.270 --> 1:02:58.870
<i>We get one
suggestion from the audience</i>

1:02:58.938 --> 1:02:59.504
<i>like</i>

1:02:59.571 --> 1:03:01.707
god or cardboard.

1:03:03.408 --> 1:03:04.920
<i>We're not going to do a full,
long improvisation about</i>

1:03:04.944 --> 1:03:05.777
<i>god or cardboard; We're going
to use this suggestion</i>

1:03:05.844 --> 1:03:08.246
<i>to be inspired by.</i>

1:03:08.313 --> 1:03:09.781
<i>You sort of toss around ideas</i>

1:03:09.848 --> 1:03:13.418
whether it's in monologue, or
word association, or whatever.

1:03:13.485 --> 1:03:16.288
And now those were our blocks
from which we could build.

1:03:16.488 --> 1:03:19.058
<i>That is going to give
information for the first scene</i>

1:03:19.125 --> 1:03:20.292
<i>that you go into.</i>

1:03:20.358 --> 1:03:21.937
Then you'd break off
and do two-person scenes.

1:03:21.961 --> 1:03:22.761
<i>Scene one, scene two,
scene three.</i>

1:03:22.828 --> 1:03:25.297
<i>Then what you do is you</i>

1:03:25.363 --> 1:03:27.265
bring each of these scenes back.

1:03:27.499 --> 1:03:29.068
<i>And the scenes can progress.</i>

1:03:29.135 --> 1:03:31.403
<i>Same characters, different time.</i>

1:03:31.470 --> 1:03:32.904
In the past or in the future.

1:03:32.972 --> 1:03:34.412
<i>And the next step of the
three scenes</i>

1:03:34.473 --> 1:03:36.908
<i>that we invented
first time around.</i>

1:03:36.976 --> 1:03:37.843
<i>And then you have a third beat,</i>

1:03:37.909 --> 1:03:39.411
<i>third set of scenes.</i>

1:03:39.478 --> 1:03:41.913
<i>And it all harkens
back to the original suggestion</i>

1:03:41.981 --> 1:03:43.448
<i>and by this time, the scenes</i>

1:03:43.515 --> 1:03:45.393
are beginning to interrelate,
to be affected by each other,

1:03:45.417 --> 1:03:46.685
to mirror each other, to rhyme

1:03:48.087 --> 1:03:49.263
with each other in some sort
of mad, conceptual way.

1:03:49.287 --> 1:03:51.690
And the goal was not to tie
it up all neatly

1:03:51.757 --> 1:03:54.326
but just to see how
some of these things

1:03:54.392 --> 1:03:56.528
<i>all along had been related.</i>

1:03:56.762 --> 1:03:58.563
<i>You see amazing moments
of discovery,</i>

1:03:58.630 --> 1:04:01.433
<i>moments of connection where
the group brain really does</i>

1:04:01.500 --> 1:04:02.534
<i>start functioning.</i>

1:04:04.203 --> 1:04:05.071
<i>Yeah, you're looking
for discoveries.</i>

1:04:05.138 --> 1:04:06.471
That's the juice of the Harold.

1:04:06.538 --> 1:04:10.475
And that's why our audience
is so much on our side.

They're seeing that you're
looking for the discovery,

1:07:05.717 --> 1:07:06.717
I learned a great lesson

which is: Conflict is boring,

1:07:09.754 --> 1:07:11.656

- what about "yes, and"?
- Hm.

1:07:19.999 --> 1:07:22.867
In these situations, "yes, and"
is a lot better.

That doesn't sound like

you're dissecting someone here.

Ooh, hey, you gotta light?

1:07:35.982 --> 1:07:38.683
Well, sometimes, you can develop
a picture of a person

1:07:38.951 --> 1:07:41.954
and that can change
right under your nose.

1:07:42.021 --> 1:07:43.021
Hm.

1:07:49.028 --> 1:07:51.629
Improvisational work itself,
I think,

1:07:51.696 --> 1:07:53.698
worked on his system, you know,

1:07:53.933 --> 1:07:56.634

1:07:57.403 --> 1:07:59.038
made him eager to open up more.

1:08:10.249 --> 1:08:13.785

began to accept himself

everyone.

1:08:28.633 --> 1:08:29.402
<i>Before the improv Olympics
I think the general consensus</i>

1:08:29.468 --> 1:08:30.769
<i>was that improvisation</i>

1:08:30.835 --> 1:08:33.671
couldn't be studied,
and it couldn't be understood

1:08:33.738 --> 1:08:34.773
and couldn't be taught.

1:08:36.409 --> 1:08:38.077
<i>And we discovered
that this was not true.</i>

1:08:38.144 --> 1:08:40.578
<i>It does not take an
enormous amount of training</i>

1:08:40.645 --> 1:08:41.689
<i>for somebody of ordinary
abilities</i>

1:08:41.713 --> 1:08:43.049
<i>and no theatrical experience</i>

1:08:43.115 --> 1:08:44.126
<i>to participate in some degree
of credibility</i>

1:08:44.150 --> 1:08:46.785
<i>in a public improvisation.</i>

1:08:49.921 --> 1:08:51.890
<i>We were freaks, basically.</i>

1:08:51.957 --> 1:08:54.126
<i>He took in a bunch of
really smart</i>

1:08:57.862 --> 1:09:00.565
by every fringe of society,

1:09:00.832 --> 1:09:02.168
and we finally found each other.

1:09:03.768 --> 1:09:05.204
<i>That becomes the
kind of Incubator</i>

1:09:05.271 --> 1:09:08.907
<i>for a lot of people who don't
belong in a</i>

1:09:08.974 --> 1:09:11.676
trad... they're not like
traditional actors.

1:09:11.743 --> 1:09:13.279
They're not standups.

1:09:13.345 --> 1:09:14.980
<i>It attracts a lot of smart,
nerdy people</i>

1:09:15.047 --> 1:09:18.050
<i>who want to exercise that

del close said
we need people like that.

1:09:52.151 --> 1:09:53.586
<i>I think he got to a point</i>

1:09:53.651 --> 1:09:55.354
<i>where he probably
became more enamoured</i>

1:09:55.421 --> 1:09:59.191
<i>with people who were
taking improv class to become</i>

1:09:59.757 --> 1:10:00.917
you know, better salespeople,

1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:02.394
because they weren't doing it

1:10:02.461 --> 1:10:05.464
<i>for the purpose
of getting on snl</i>

1:10:05.531 --> 1:10:06.966
<i>or getting a sitcom</i>

1:10:07.032 --> 1:10:08.267
or a fucking beer commercial.

1:10:08.334 --> 1:10:10.735
They just wanted to, like,
come out of their shell.

1:10:11.036 --> 1:10:12.871
<i>One of del's
favorite students was a</i>

1:10:12.938 --> 1:10:16.108
deaf prison electrician, um.

1:10:17.042 --> 1:10:20.045
He was this older,
middle-aged guy

1:10:20.112 --> 1:10:22.114
<i>he had actually done
some living,</i>

1:10:22.314 --> 1:10:24.782
<i>and he had interesting
life experiences,</i>

1:10:25.284 --> 1:10:28.120
<i>regretfully, we could
not locate the electrician.</i>

1:10:28.354 --> 1:10:31.656
<i>But we did find a few tapes
with these guys on them.</i>

1:10:38.197 --> 1:10:40.232
Ted Bundy was quite a character.

1:10:40.299 --> 1:10:41.967
Let's edit that out.
That feels wrong.

1:10:42.168 --> 1:10:43.735
My name is Amy poehler,

1:10:43.801 --> 1:10:46.671

1:10:54.146 --> 1:10:55.747
I didn't know what
I wanted to do,

1:10:55.813 --> 1:10:56.915
<i>and he gave me a vision</i>

1:10:56.982 --> 1:10:59.218
<i>to say yes onstage and in life.</i>

1:10:59.985 --> 1:11:02.988
There's no wrong move.

1:11:03.055 --> 1:11:05.857
<i>You're a poet onstage.
You're an artist.</i>

1:11:05.924 --> 1:11:09.161
<i>Take what you have in your life,
and put it into your art.</i>

1:11:09.361 --> 1:11:10.572
We were all so obsessed with it.

1:11:10.596 --> 1:11:13.798
We would do harolds
in people's living rooms.

1:11:13.865 --> 1:11:15.833
We would rehearse
in dining rooms.

1:11:15.900 --> 1:11:16.901
<i>Anywhere we could.</i>

1:11:18.404 --> 1:11:19.205
<i>When I improvise with someone,</i>

1:11:19.271 --> 1:11:20.282
we can do something a lot better

1:11:20.306 --> 1:11:22.774
than either of us
are capable of.

1:11:22.975 --> 1:11:24.876
<i>A notion of "just pay attention"</i>

1:11:24.944 --> 1:11:26.844
<i>just care about
this other person.</i>

1:11:27.246 --> 1:11:28.647
Rather than get the laugh.

1:11:28.713 --> 1:11:29.582
<i>You also have to remember</i>

1:11:29.648 --> 1:11:31.716
<i>you're in the 1980s.</i>

1:11:33.152 --> 1:11:35.063
There's actually the opposite
message is being told

1:11:35.087 --> 1:11:36.121
in our society.

1:11:37.489 --> 1:11:39.234
We're being told that the
individual is what rules now

1:11:39.258 --> 1:11:41.026
I mean, if you need help,
you're weak.

1:11:42.628 --> 1:11:44.105
<i>If you watch
"Ferris Bueller's day off",</i>

1:11:44.129 --> 1:11:46.632
<i>you know, it's a very
entertaining movie,</i>

1:11:46.699 --> 1:11:48.376
<i>but the message of that movie
is about one guy</i>

1:11:48.400 --> 1:11:50.200
<i>who's in charge. One guy who
games the system.</i>

1:11:51.769 --> 1:11:54.006
<i>Like Arnold Schwarzenegger
is the one guy,</i>

1:11:54.240 --> 1:11:56.976
and meanwhile, del is teaching
the exact opposite,

1:11:57.042 --> 1:11:58.310
and what you discover is

1:11:58.377 --> 1:12:00.878
it's got a tremendous
amount of power.

1:12:04.650 --> 1:12:06.252
<i>And the people who really
commit to it,</i>

1:12:06.318 --> 1:12:09.121
<i>just right away start doing
special, unique work.</i>

1:12:17.029 --> 1:12:18.197
<i>It's a true outsider art.</i>

1:12:18.264 --> 1:12:20.898
It's just filled with people
who are funny

1:12:20.966 --> 1:12:22.534
and that like you,
no matter what.

1:12:22.601 --> 1:12:25.170
<i>You feel like, you're part of
a much bigger thing.</i>

1:12:25.404 --> 1:12:26.884
My friends in
scarbrough, Ontario said

1:12:26.939 --> 1:12:30.976
"so what do you do? Kinda like,
get drunk and crack jokes?"

1:12:31.310 --> 1:12:34.346
And it's kind of, halfway
between that and

1:12:35.414 --> 1:12:39.184
uh, truly getting in touch
with your higher self.

1:12:50.195 --> 1:12:51.363
<i>Are you a comedy fan?</i>

1:12:53.098 --> 1:12:54.609
<i>If so, you have this man
to thank for developing</i>

1:12:54.633 --> 1:12:57.102
<i>countless comedians
and comic actors</i>

1:12:57.169 --> 1:12:57.936
<i>over the years.</i>

1:12:58.003 --> 1:13:00.005
<i>His name is del close.</i>

1:13:01.674 --> 1:13:03.175
<i>In the 80s, more and more people</i>

1:13:03.242 --> 1:13:05.644
<i>were moving to Chicago
to do long-form improv.</i>

1:13:05.711 --> 1:13:08.314
And del was the selling point.

1:13:08.714 --> 1:13:10.282
<i>And now I would like you to meet</i>

1:13:10.349 --> 1:13:12.418
the best partner
a girl could have...

1:13:12.484 --> 1:13:14.119
Mr. Del close!

1:13:16.355 --> 1:13:18.390
<i>I think as he got older,</i>

1:13:18.457 --> 1:13:21.660
<i>he carried himself
in that guru way,</i>

1:13:21.727 --> 1:13:23.662
<i>and I think he enjoyed the role.</i>

1:13:23.729 --> 1:13:25.664
There wasn't a modesty
of like "oh, no, no,

1:13:25.731 --> 1:13:29.034
please, I'm just here
to run a few exercises".

1:13:31.370 --> 1:13:34.139
<i>For charna,
as the businesswoman,</i>

1:13:34.373 --> 1:13:37.076

this is the guy!

1:13:38.277 --> 1:13:40.312
Everybody has to study
with this guy.

1:13:40.379 --> 1:13:41.913
<i>You've gotta come through here,</i>

1:13:41.980 --> 1:13:44.483
<i>take all the levels
to get to this guy.</i>

1:13:44.550 --> 1:13:45.117
<i>It is a cult.</i>

1:13:45.184 --> 1:13:46.385
Uh, um, yeah.

1:13:47.219 --> 1:13:48.853
Improv olympic is a cult,

1:13:49.121 --> 1:13:50.855
and I got sucked into it, um...

1:13:51.123 --> 1:13:52.424
<i>One night, out of nowhere,</i>

1:13:52.491 --> 1:13:55.060
<i>these like eight guys
came at me,</i>

1:13:55.127 --> 1:13:56.695
<i>and they were just these like,</i>

1:13:56.762 --> 1:13:59.331
<i>doughy looking white guys
in khaki pants,</i>

1:13:59.398 --> 1:14:01.400
and they told me,
I had to go with them,

1:14:01.600 --> 1:14:05.137
and that I couldn't
deny anything they said,

1:14:05.371 --> 1:14:08.073
and that I had to
heighten their initiation.

1:14:08.407 --> 1:14:10.709
And, you know,
the next thing I know,

1:14:10.776 --> 1:14:13.979
I'm writing out checks
to yes, and productions.

1:14:14.380 --> 1:14:16.348
<i>A cult of personality
was forming,</i>

1:14:16.415 --> 1:14:17.983
<i>distracting del
from other things.</i>

1:14:18.250 --> 1:14:19.985
<i>Like say,</i>

1:14:20.052 --> 1:14:21.629
<i>living up to the ideals
of his egaitarian art form</i>

1:14:21.653 --> 1:14:24.223
<i>by putting someone other
than white guys</i>

1:14:24.289 --> 1:14:25.890
<i>from schomberg onstage.</i>

1:14:27.393 --> 1:14:28.713
<i>But alas,
his focus was elsewhere.</i>

1:14:29.795 --> 1:14:31.096
I sometimes sit around
and wonder

1:14:31.163 --> 1:14:33.298
would I like to have millions
and millions of dollars?

1:14:34.266 --> 1:14:36.502
Direct movies?
Direct Broadway plays?

1:14:38.404 --> 1:14:41.073
Raise arabian stallions?

1:14:44.209 --> 1:14:47.146
Or work with charna here at...

1:14:51.450 --> 1:14:54.019
I think there was a big part of
del that wanted to be famous.

1:14:55.053 --> 1:14:57.156
<i>I think it was a conflict
within himself,</i>

1:14:57.356 --> 1:15:01.126
<i>between his artistic aspirations
and wanting popular fame</i>

1:15:01.193 --> 1:15:02.370
<i>like his contemporaries,
you know?</i>

1:15:02.394 --> 1:15:03.994
Like Mike Nichols,
who couldn't have been

1:15:04.196 --> 1:15:05.764
bigger.

1:15:05.831 --> 1:15:07.232
<i>His Broadway directing debut</i>

1:15:07.299 --> 1:15:09.401
<i>with Neil Simon's
"barefoot in the park"</i>

1:15:09.468 --> 1:15:11.236
earned Nichols the first
of six Tony awards

1:15:11.303 --> 1:15:14.006
and the reputation
for having the midas touch.

1:15:14.239 --> 1:15:15.316
<i>If I'd gone
a different direction,</i>

1:15:15.340 --> 1:15:16.620
maybe I'd have arabian stallions

1:15:16.675 --> 1:15:19.445
and be married to Diana Sawyer
like Mike Nichols,

1:15:19.511 --> 1:15:20.511
but here,

1:15:21.346 --> 1:15:22.546
I'm in a basement with charna.

1:15:23.949 --> 1:15:25.484
<i>And he had a sense
of humor about it,</i>

1:15:25.551 --> 1:15:26.561
<i>but it's only natural to
compare yourself to your peers,</i>

1:15:26.585 --> 1:15:29.054
<i>that he had come up with,</i>

1:15:29.121 --> 1:15:30.789
<i>and to see his students
reap awards</i>

1:15:30.856 --> 1:15:32.224
<i>that he never reaped himself.</i>

1:15:33.826 --> 1:15:34.726
<i>You know, it's gotta be
hard sometimes.</i>

1:15:34.793 --> 1:15:37.496
And he's like, "wait a minute!"

1:15:38.163 --> 1:15:40.299
I taught that big guy
with the glasses

1:15:40.365 --> 1:15:41.500
<i>everything he knows,</i>

1:15:42.100 --> 1:15:43.402
<i>and he's using what I'm using,</i>

1:15:43.469 --> 1:15:45.237
<i>and so is that Rachel dratch,</i>

1:15:45.504 --> 1:15:47.239
<i>"and I feel like
they ripped me off!"</i>

1:15:47.506 --> 1:15:48.874
We were like, "well, I thought,

1:15:48.942 --> 1:15:51.276
the idea was that you teach us,
and we could use it."

1:15:51.877 --> 1:15:53.312
<i>But we realized
he was just wounded.</i>

1:15:53.378 --> 1:15:54.546
<i>He felt a little left out.</i>

1:15:55.881 --> 1:15:57.161
<i>It bugged him.
It definitely did.</i>

1:16:00.252 --> 1:16:01.887
<i>Alright,
we're rolling right now.</i>

1:16:01.955 --> 1:16:03.795
<i>As comfortable as you are
talking about this...</i>

1:16:05.824 --> 1:16:06.325
<i>You worked with
Saturday night live for awhile.</i>

1:16:06.391 --> 1:16:07.391
Yeah, yes.

1:16:08.494 --> 1:16:09.795
<i>And what do you think</i>

1:16:09.862 --> 1:16:11.363
<i>when you see
all these improvisers</i>

1:16:11.430 --> 1:16:13.298
<i>from Chicago going out,
and doing things like.</i>

1:16:13.365 --> 1:16:14.700
<i>Saturday night live?</i>

1:16:14.766 --> 1:16:16.846
I mean, you can't work
with all these terrific people

1:16:17.135 --> 1:16:18.135
um,

1:16:19.238 --> 1:16:20.606
you know, without... But then,

1:16:23.509 --> 1:16:25.344
<i>a Harvard medical school study</i>

1:16:25.410 --> 1:16:27.479
has determined that
rectal thermometers

1:16:27.546 --> 1:16:30.015
are still the best ways
to take a baby's temperature.

1:16:30.215 --> 1:16:33.218
Plus it really teaches the baby
who's boss.

1:16:33.285 --> 1:16:34.662
I mean have you ever gone
on vacation,

1:16:34.686 --> 1:16:35.854
and left your child home?

1:16:39.224 --> 1:16:40.559
No.

1:16:40.626 --> 1:16:42.261
- Old testament, Mr. Mayor.
<i>- Yes.</i>

1:16:42.327 --> 1:16:43.862
Real wrath of god type stuff.

1:16:43.929 --> 1:16:46.298
Forty years of darkness,
earthquakes, volcanoes!

1:16:46.365 --> 1:16:47.432
<i>Human sacrifice!</i>

1:16:47.499 --> 1:16:49.468
Dogs and cats, living together!

1:16:49.535 --> 1:16:51.169
I can't believe what
an asshole you are!

1:16:51.236 --> 1:16:52.304
No, maybe, she smiled.

1:16:52.371 --> 1:16:53.748
She's smiling at
what an asshole you are

1:16:53.772 --> 1:16:55.772
no, no, no, no, she was smiling
at how money I was.

1:16:59.811 --> 1:17:01.422
Historically, syphillis
is right up there with Germans.

1:17:01.446 --> 1:17:02.881
Morning, everybody!

1:17:04.049 --> 1:17:05.159
Though you don't want
a fish sandwich?

1:17:05.183 --> 1:17:07.886
Upright citizens bri...

1:17:07.954 --> 1:17:08.954
Behave!

1:17:09.956 --> 1:17:10.956
Hi!

1:17:12.324 --> 1:17:14.159
Correct.

1:17:19.431 --> 1:17:21.133
<i>Was he cool being the teacher,</i>

1:17:21.199 --> 1:17:22.501
<i>the trainer,</i>

1:17:22.568 --> 1:17:24.403
<i>the guy that
you've never heard of?</i>

1:17:25.972 --> 1:17:27.172
Well,

1:17:27.573 --> 1:17:29.174
I don't know, I mean...

1:17:29.374 --> 1:17:30.654
I can't tell you
what he thought.

1:17:32.177 --> 1:17:34.479
<i>But I can tell you that
the last conversation</i>

1:17:34.546 --> 1:17:36.015
<i>that I had with him</i>

1:17:36.081 --> 1:17:38.617
<i>I told him,
I hope I made you proud.</i>

1:17:38.817 --> 1:17:41.286
<i>And he said, "yes."</i>

1:17:41.353 --> 1:17:43.488
<i>That I, like,
never let him down.</i>

1:17:45.390 --> 1:17:47.125
<i>And it was weird because he</i>

1:17:47.326 --> 1:17:48.436
<i>how do you say goodbye
to somebody</i>

1:17:48.460 --> 1:17:49.695
for the last time, you know?

1:17:52.731 --> 1:17:54.199
<i>I saw that he was weaker</i>

1:17:54.266 --> 1:17:55.167
<i>like when we'd walk somewhere</i>

1:17:55.233 --> 1:17:56.535
<i>he'd have to stop and breathe.</i>

1:17:58.270 --> 1:18:00.190
<i>He was now coughing so badly
that he would vomit.</i>

1:18:00.872 --> 1:18:02.708
I was so angry
because he was still smoking

1:18:02.774 --> 1:18:03.875
at the time.

1:18:03.943 --> 1:18:05.353
I was like, "you can't
smoke anymore."

1:18:05.377 --> 1:18:07.446
And I remember
<i>when we went to the doctor,</i>

1:18:07.512 --> 1:18:08.982
<i>they did all these tests,</i>

1:18:09.048 --> 1:18:09.881
<i>and the doctor came out,
and he said,</i>

1:18:09.949 --> 1:18:11.149
<i>"it's emphysema."</i>

1:18:12.117 --> 1:18:13.685
<i>So it's a pretty awful death.</i>

1:18:16.321 --> 1:18:17.565
<i>But we had a great party for him</i>

1:18:17.589 --> 1:18:20.192
<i>like he wanted
to die a special way.</i>

1:18:20.392 --> 1:18:21.672
<i>Me and bill Murray
pulled it off.</i>

1:18:34.840 --> 1:18:37.476
<i>The hospital gave me
this room in the basement,</i>

1:18:37.676 --> 1:18:41.179
<i>and all these people came back,
I mean everyone came back.</i>

1:18:41.780 --> 1:18:43.382
<i>Murrays there, and ramis.</i>

1:18:43.448 --> 1:18:45.183
<i>Charna is obviously hosting, and</i>

1:18:45.250 --> 1:18:48.620
<i>really guiding everybody
through the processes well.</i>

1:18:48.687 --> 1:18:50.389
Well, she's the high priestess.

1:18:51.823 --> 1:18:54.760
It was hard on Bernie.
Much harder than he let on.

1:18:55.694 --> 1:18:57.529
<i>And he wanted to go talk to del.</i>

1:18:59.297 --> 1:19:01.043
<i>Charna already knew that they
were going to have a moment,</i>

1:19:01.067 --> 1:19:03.402
<i>so she kind of cleared out
this place for these two</i>

1:19:03.602 --> 1:19:05.704
<i>giants to have their final chat.</i>

1:19:07.372 --> 1:19:09.508
<i>And you could see at one point,
del kinda nodding,</i>

1:19:09.708 --> 1:19:11.376
<i>nodding, and he was</i>

1:19:11.443 --> 1:19:12.444
kind of leaning, and.

1:19:13.512 --> 1:19:14.080
I thought he was
going to topple forward,

1:19:14.147 --> 1:19:15.347
and for a moment,

1:19:16.648 --> 1:19:17.549
I thought, and a bunch of people
around me thought,

1:19:17.616 --> 1:19:18.183
maybe this... Maybe he's going,

1:19:18.250 --> 1:19:19.518
maybe this is it?

1:19:21.054 --> 1:19:22.797
And then somebody said to me,
in that typical second city

1:19:22.821 --> 1:19:25.424
scene...-
stepping on his air tube!

1:19:26.892 --> 1:19:27.893
And then, Bernie's like,

1:19:27.960 --> 1:19:29.104
"what?" "you're on his oxygen!"

1:19:29.128 --> 1:19:29.828
He goes like this,
and then del's like,

1:19:29.895 --> 1:19:32.264
"whoa! Hey, I'm back!"

1:19:32.497 --> 1:19:34.332
I gave him a hug,
and he said to me,

1:19:34.833 --> 1:19:36.268
"here's an art form!"

1:19:37.669 --> 1:19:40.672
And I said, "del, for tonight,
it's an art form."

1:19:43.176 --> 1:19:44.010
<i>It's worth noting,
that on his last</i>

1:19:44.077 --> 1:19:45.510
<i>full day on earth,</i>

1:19:45.577 --> 1:19:47.512
<i>del didn't tell
the wild stories.</i>

1:19:48.914 --> 1:19:51.416
<i>He didn't talk about the drugs,
the rage, the chaos,</i>

1:19:51.483 --> 1:19:52.784
<i>the stunts, the myths.</i>

1:19:54.553 --> 1:19:56.393
<i>He didn't even tell
his father's suicide story.</i>

1:19:56.521 --> 1:19:57.622
<i>Hm.</i>

1:19:57.823 --> 1:19:59.224
<i>Wonder why.</i>

1:20:00.859 --> 1:20:02.379
<i>I found out
when I was writing my book,</i>

1:20:02.427 --> 1:20:03.462
a few years later,

1:20:05.031 --> 1:20:06.765
<i>it wasn't exactly
the way he told it.</i>

1:20:08.201 --> 1:20:09.634
<i>Del was in New York, you know,</i>

1:20:09.701 --> 1:20:12.437
<i>he was a thousand
more miles away,</i>

1:20:12.504 --> 1:20:14.140
<i>when his father
actually killed himself.</i>

1:20:14.207 --> 1:20:15.108
<i>He said he was ten years old
when it happened.</i>

1:20:15.174 --> 1:20:15.975
<i>Well, he was twenty years old.</i>

1:20:16.042 --> 1:20:18.243
<i>So he kept changing all of this.</i>

1:20:20.012 --> 1:20:21.622
<i>And he would just sit back
and let the legend grow</i>

1:20:21.646 --> 1:20:23.715
<i>because he knew that's
what was happening with it.</i>

1:20:27.719 --> 1:20:30.722
Yeah, yeah,
I've heard that story.

1:20:33.625 --> 1:20:35.660
Is it true? I don't know.

1:20:37.964 --> 1:20:39.865
<i>But that's part
of the complexity</i>

1:20:40.599 --> 1:20:41.800
<i>that made up del.</i>

1:20:44.170 --> 1:20:45.904
<i>Del's telling that story</i>

1:20:45.972 --> 1:20:48.340
<i>about his father, even if
it wasn't factually true,</i>

1:20:48.807 --> 1:20:50.408
<i>that says something about del.</i>

1:20:51.743 --> 1:20:53.879
<i>Stories are a wonderful tool</i>

1:20:53.946 --> 1:20:56.815
<i>for getting at
what we're all about.</i>

1:20:57.816 --> 1:21:00.253
<i>But all stories are lies.</i>

1:21:00.786 --> 1:21:03.421
Lies in service of the truth.

1:21:04.556 --> 1:21:06.391
Or maybe in search of the truth.

1:21:08.161 --> 1:21:10.695
<i>You know, and that's what
"wasteland" was for del.</i>

1:21:11.931 --> 1:21:12.931
<i>Del</i>

1:21:14.267 --> 1:21:16.568
<i>wanted "wasteland"
to be a rulebook</i>

1:21:16.835 --> 1:21:18.703
<i>of the nature of comedy.</i>

1:21:19.638 --> 1:21:21.740
<i>But, at the end of the day,</i>

1:21:21.807 --> 1:21:24.509
<i>it was a way to come to terms
with the world view</i>

1:21:24.576 --> 1:21:25.710
<i>that he taught</i>

1:21:26.711 --> 1:21:28.413
<i>that comedy's about</i>

1:21:28.480 --> 1:21:29.648
everybody.

1:21:29.714 --> 1:21:31.583
It's about the stage.

1:21:31.883 --> 1:21:34.653
It's about the story
and the experience,

1:21:34.719 --> 1:21:36.688
not about any one person.

1:21:47.732 --> 1:21:49.367
<i>He was a young comedian.</i>

1:21:50.635 --> 1:21:52.370
<i>He didn't know
what he was doing.</i>

1:21:52.437 --> 1:21:54.477
<i>He got into show business
for all the wrong reasons.</i>

1:21:55.841 --> 1:21:58.743
He got satisfaction in the fact
that it was too easy.

1:21:59.644 --> 1:22:02.347
Very easy, very easy to impress.

1:22:03.682 --> 1:22:05.550
<i>But then he began to learn.</i>

1:22:06.551 --> 1:22:07.551
You!

1:22:08.720 --> 1:22:10.856
You! You, you asshole!
You began to learn.

1:22:11.958 --> 1:22:13.925
<i>And then you began to realize</i>

1:22:14.593 --> 1:22:16.394
<i>what you've
gotten yourself into.</i>

1:22:18.630 --> 1:22:20.799
<i>I am not what
he expected to become.</i>

1:22:22.901 --> 1:22:24.436
<i>I am the messenger.</i>

1:22:25.537 --> 1:22:26.771
<i>I am the channel.</i>

1:22:28.274 --> 1:22:30.408
<i>I am the door through which</i>

1:22:30.775 --> 1:22:31.978
you will pass,

1:22:33.045 --> 1:22:34.713
but he may not.

1:22:35.547 --> 1:22:36.581
<i>But he understands.</i>

1:22:56.035 --> 1:22:58.403
<i>Some people have a simple story.</i>

1:22:58.803 --> 1:23:00.872
<i>One the world eats up,</i>

1:23:00.940 --> 1:23:03.508
<i>and success comes easily.</i>

1:23:04.076 --> 1:23:05.644
<i>But fuck those people.</i>

1:23:05.710 --> 1:23:07.545
<i>Because there's another group</i>

1:23:07.746 --> 1:23:09.881
<i>who are a little louder,
weirder,</i>

1:23:09.949 --> 1:23:12.617
<i>sloppier, little more honest.</i>

1:23:13.319 --> 1:23:14.619
<i>And for them,</i>

1:23:14.819 --> 1:23:16.956
<i>del kicked open a door.</i>

1:23:18.324 --> 1:23:20.558
You know, as I leave it,

1:23:21.726 --> 1:23:23.996
I began to realize that
we really haven't done

1:23:24.063 --> 1:23:25.063
such a bad job

1:23:25.097 --> 1:23:26.097
<i>for the world,</i>

1:23:26.999 --> 1:23:29.434
<i>and I think that we need</i>

1:23:29.868 --> 1:23:32.904
<i>all my fellow conspiratorians</i>

1:23:33.738 --> 1:23:35.707
<i>to recognize this.</i>

1:23:36.641 --> 1:23:39.844
You know, we're not doing as bad
as they claim we are.

1:23:40.112 --> 1:23:43.082
And so let's hear it
for the fucking human race.

1:24:00.099 --> 1:24:01.666
<i>Haven't I passed
this way before?</i>

1:24:01.733 --> 1:24:03.735
<i>Same sewer, different ending.</i>

1:24:03.936 --> 1:24:05.804
<i>Oh.</i>

1:24:06.638 --> 1:24:08.473
I guess this is the end.

1:24:26.158 --> 1:24:28.560
<i>It's kinda like fireworks,
the most ephemeral</i>

1:24:28.626 --> 1:24:29.661
<i>of art forms.</i>

1:24:29.728 --> 1:24:31.863
You know, once it's gone,
it's gone, baby.

1:24:31.931 --> 1:24:33.898
There's the afterimage
for a few seconds,

1:24:34.100 --> 1:24:36.668
but nobody will ever see
anything like it again.

1:25:33.892 --> 1:25:36.028
<i>Del wanted to bequeath his skull</i>

1:25:36.095 --> 1:25:38.064
<i>to the Goodman theater,
to Robert falls.</i>

1:25:38.130 --> 1:25:39.898
So that he could keep working,
you know.

1:25:39.965 --> 1:25:42.567
He wanted to be yorick, in uh,

1:25:42.834 --> 1:25:43.701
in Hamlet.

1:25:43.768 --> 1:25:46.638
So you accepted the gift of the

1:25:46.871 --> 1:25:49.408
the skull. I think that's great.

1:25:49.475 --> 1:25:50.909
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:25:50.976 --> 1:25:52.644
<i>I guess I'm early though.</i>

1:25:54.113 --> 1:25:55.548
<i>So on his death bed,
he said to me,</i>

1:25:55.613 --> 1:25:57.083
<i>"make it happen,
any way you can."</i>

1:25:57.283 --> 1:25:58.716
Well, it isn't that easy.

1:25:59.751 --> 1:26:01.886
I called so many places,
and so many, um,

1:26:02.488 --> 1:26:05.824
and associations, and said,
"you can have the body to study"

1:26:05.890 --> 1:26:06.890
just...

1:26:07.993 --> 1:26:09.761
"Decapitate him,
and prepare the skull."

1:26:11.464 --> 1:26:13.264
<i>And most people would say,
"oh, no thank you."</i>

1:26:13.665 --> 1:26:15.834
<i>So I went to this place where
they sell skulls, and</i>

1:26:16.068 --> 1:26:19.604
human bones to hospitals,
and stuff like that.

1:26:19.804 --> 1:26:21.840
And my sister and I,
we went shopping

1:26:22.041 --> 1:26:23.641
<i>to go pick out skulls.</i>

1:26:26.412 --> 1:26:28.012
<i>So then I was like,
"this looks like him.</i>

1:26:28.047 --> 1:26:29.057
<i>And this doesn't.
This head's big enough!"</i>

1:26:29.081 --> 1:26:31.450
<i>And so we bought a skull,</i>

1:26:31.517 --> 1:26:32.693
and I'll never forget, because
I went back to my hou...

1:26:32.717 --> 1:26:34.477
Sister's house with her,
and then I realized,

1:26:34.786 --> 1:26:36.188
del didn't have teeth.

1:26:37.822 --> 1:26:39.691
<i>She pulled the teeth for me.</i>

1:26:39.757 --> 1:26:40.658
<i>I was too squeamish.</i>

1:26:40.725 --> 1:26:42.394
<i>And um, I took the skull home,</i>

1:26:42.461 --> 1:26:44.964
<i>and put it in my pantry,
and waited a few months</i>

1:26:45.030 --> 1:26:46.640
<i>'cause I read that beetles have
eated... that there' this whole</i>

1:26:46.664 --> 1:26:49.901
<i>process to preparing a skull,
so I had to pretend</i>

1:26:49.969 --> 1:26:51.170
<i>that I was doing that.</i>

1:26:53.771 --> 1:26:55.941
<i>I got away with it for years,
and years and years,</i>

1:26:56.142 --> 1:26:57.842
'til some jerky reporter

1:26:58.310 --> 1:27:00.879
brought some actor there,
and it turns out there was

1:27:00.946 --> 1:27:02.524
a screw that showed
there was an autopsy,

1:27:02.548 --> 1:27:04.849
and that the screw itself
was sixty years old,

1:27:04.916 --> 1:27:05.916
and I was like,

1:27:06.585 --> 1:27:07.865
aw, man,
why would you ruin that?

1:27:08.720 --> 1:27:10.322
<i>So I did get caught,
in the long run.</i>

1:27:10.389 --> 1:27:12.992
<i>But at least, he got
another story out of it.</i>

1:27:13.259 --> 1:27:15.127
And I figured del would
like that, you know,

1:27:15.194 --> 1:27:16.828
because del taught us

1:27:17.062 --> 1:27:18.964
that we take care
of each other's ideas,

1:27:19.031 --> 1:27:20.132
that we make them happen.

1:27:20.199 --> 1:27:21.866
We don't say no
to each other's ideas.

1:27:21.934 --> 1:27:23.169
We make them happen.

1:27:23.235 --> 1:27:25.035
And that's what he wanted,
and that was my job

1:27:25.070 --> 1:27:26.205
was to make it happen.

1:27:26.838 --> 1:27:27.839
Any way I can.
