00:16.880 --> 00:18.080
[girl] Ryan!-

00:41.760 --> 00:43.840
Ryan, are you comin' already?

00:44.480 --> 00:45.920
I'm coming!

00:48.520 --> 00:50.160
[monitor beeping]

00:55.240 --> 00:56.560
[alarm sounds in the distance]

00:59.120 --> 01:01.120
Hang in there, Ryan.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.720
Just a bit more, I promise.

01:09.800 --> 01:11.000
[Eric] Come on.

01:12.160 --> 01:13.960
This is the place I was talking about.

01:18.880 --> 01:20.520
What is this place?

01:21.640 --> 01:24.160
You think this is what Judy
was looking for that night?

01:24.240 --> 01:25.720
Mmm-hmm.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.640
Wait, how did you even-- Hey!

01:28.720 --> 01:31.120
What... Stop!
What are you doing?

01:31.680 --> 01:34.680
Hey, wait, no!
Don't leave! Hey!

01:35.320 --> 01:39.040
Help! Help!

01:39.880 --> 01:41.880
[theme music playing]

02:02.400 --> 02:03.880
It's over.

02:06.480 --> 02:09.240
But why? She adores you.

02:09.320 --> 02:12.880
Yeah...
Well, now she adores Alex.

02:12.960 --> 02:14.920
The new kid?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.120
[chuckles]

02:16.840 --> 02:17.760
Are you sure about that?

02:19.080 --> 02:22.560
They were slow dancing in front
of the entire school. I'm pretty sure.

02:24.720 --> 02:26.920
She gave you up for him?

02:28.240 --> 02:30.720
That makes no sense.
I mean, he doesn't hold a candle to you.

02:30.800 --> 02:33.360
-Does that girl even know who she has?
-Okay, Mom!

02:34.160 --> 02:35.360
Can we stop talking about this?

02:37.080 --> 02:38.360
Okay.

02:38.880 --> 02:40.840
You're better off,
that's all I have to say about that.

02:41.840 --> 02:42.840
I'm not.

02:44.360 --> 02:47.240
She's an amazing girl
and I was stupid enough to drive her away.

02:48.440 --> 02:51.000
I was angry,
so I acted like a jerk around her.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.680
A real woman doesn't quit
when it gets a little tough.

02:55.640 --> 02:59.360
[scoffs] So disappointing.
She is not the person I thought she was.

02:59.440 --> 03:02.560
[chuckles] Funny,
she said the same thing about you.

03:03.640 --> 03:04.600
What do you mean?

03:06.960 --> 03:08.640
Nothing. Forget it.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.080
[sighs]

03:14.160 --> 03:17.000
For some reason, she was convinced

03:17.080 --> 03:19.440
you made the Taser barb
evidence disappear.

03:19.520 --> 03:20.640
What?

03:24.000 --> 03:25.480
That's nonsense. [scoffs]

03:26.080 --> 03:28.720
At least now I don't have to deal
with her conspiracy theories anymore.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.200
[chuckles softly]

03:47.040 --> 03:48.480
-[Eric] Everything went smoothly.
-[car unlocks]

03:49.040 --> 03:50.760
The delivery was made.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.680
Yep, just like you asked.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.360
[engine starts]

04:10.440 --> 04:12.880
Oh, you missed a spot.
Right there.

04:15.320 --> 04:16.519
Hi, Judy!

04:18.800 --> 04:20.000
Hi, Jason.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.400
[cell door unlocks]

04:44.000 --> 04:44.960
Here.

04:46.720 --> 04:50.120
Eat something.
You must be starving.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.120
I never meant for this to happen.

04:55.200 --> 04:56.720
I want you to know that.

04:56.800 --> 04:59.640
I can't believe I didn't figure out
you were on Judy's side.

05:00.840 --> 05:03.240
I understand how this must
all look to you, but--

05:03.320 --> 05:04.920
Look to me?

05:05.000 --> 05:07.760
I wonder how it will look to my dad
when he finds out what you've done!

05:10.880 --> 05:13.280
No, no. Marcus, wait.
Look...

05:13.360 --> 05:15.600
you've known me since the day I was born.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.800
Please let me go.
I promise I won't tell anyone.

05:18.880 --> 05:22.080
I'm sorry. I can't.

05:25.480 --> 05:26.760
You should eat.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.840
Marcus! Marcus, let me out!

05:33.920 --> 05:36.240
Please, there's nothing I can do!
I'm sorry!

05:36.320 --> 05:38.080
That's a lie and you know it!

05:38.160 --> 05:40.400
-How could you betray me?
-[alarm sounds in the distance]

05:41.240 --> 05:42.080
[cell gate opens]

05:46.400 --> 05:49.440
Save your voice, Brooke.
We need to talk.

05:55.320 --> 05:58.200
-Have you guys seen Brooke?
-Why don't you ask her new boyfriend?

05:59.200 --> 06:02.400
Oh! My bad.
I mean her 24-hour rebound.

06:02.480 --> 06:03.680
-[scoffs]
-Look, man,

06:03.760 --> 06:05.200
I'm just trying to save you
some heartbreak

06:05.280 --> 06:06.480
for when she gets bored and dumps you.

06:07.320 --> 06:11.440
Oh! If I was looking for dating advice,
you'd be the last person I'd ask.

06:11.520 --> 06:13.920
-Dude, what did you just say?
-I'm not afraid of you, Daniel.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.160
And don't blame me for what happened
between you and Brooke.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.760
-You did that all by yourself.
-[scoffs]

06:18.840 --> 06:20.840
[Sophie] Hey, hey, hey!
Let's all calm down, okay?

06:22.800 --> 06:24.800
So you guys sure you haven't seen Brooke?

06:26.200 --> 06:27.200
[sighs]

06:38.440 --> 06:40.040
Oh, you really got that guy!

06:41.560 --> 06:45.360
Watch out! There's a bad guy.
Behind that tree.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.480
-Jackie, are you going to--
-Do you mind?

06:52.560 --> 06:53.960
All right then.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.560
You know what?
I think this one goes right there...

07:02.640 --> 07:06.360
Where did you take that from?
These pieces have a specific order!

07:08.800 --> 07:11.080
-Everybody! I need your help!
-Is everything okay?

07:11.160 --> 07:14.560
No! It's a disaster!
My Warcraft guild is stuck in a cage

07:14.640 --> 07:17.160
and the only way to unlock it is to answer
this riddle which none of us can answer!

07:17.240 --> 07:18.280
I can't even answer it!

07:18.360 --> 07:20.400
Max, it's so much worse than I imagined!

07:20.480 --> 07:23.400
-I know!
-I can help! I love riddles!

07:23.480 --> 07:24.720
Great!

07:25.360 --> 07:26.760
-It goes like this...
-Okay.

07:26.840 --> 07:28.320
[clears throat]

07:28.400 --> 07:31.920
"Who are the three who fall asleep
in Amsterdam and wake up in Paris?"

07:32.000 --> 07:34.720
Paris... Wait, wait, I'm...

07:34.800 --> 07:39.000
So, let's see, um, the Three Musketeers?
Yeah? Oh, but they're French.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.920
Um... No, you said they're in Amsterdam,

07:42.000 --> 07:44.560
so perhaps this has something
to do with Van Gogh?

07:44.640 --> 07:46.400
If Van Gogh...

07:48.400 --> 07:52.160
All right, so Paris is about
400 miles away from Amsterdam,

07:52.240 --> 07:53.800
they're both capital cities...

07:54.640 --> 07:57.320
-Emma would've loved this riddle.
-I already hate it.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.320
[Aspen] The government in Holland
is in the Hague.

07:59.400 --> 08:02.000
Which they pronounce as "Den Haag!"
Haag! Haag...

08:02.840 --> 08:04.080
The tulips! Tulips in Holland.

08:04.160 --> 08:06.960
What does that have to do with anything?

08:07.480 --> 08:08.880
At least I'm trying!

08:08.960 --> 08:11.280
Leo, come on.
You're you on my team, yeah?

08:11.360 --> 08:12.680
Come on, help me.

08:15.160 --> 08:18.400
Let's pitch in, guys.
Uh, we're the Ravens, right?

08:18.480 --> 08:19.720
We can solve this thing.

08:21.320 --> 08:23.600
Everyone, let's crack this stumper.

08:29.280 --> 08:30.200
We need to talk.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.480
Fine. Talk.

08:36.799 --> 08:38.159
This is hard.

08:38.799 --> 08:40.039
You poor thing.

08:43.320 --> 08:44.800
What I'm trying to say is...

08:47.000 --> 08:48.080
I wasn't honest with you.

08:49.320 --> 08:52.000
-I know that.
-[sighs heavily]

08:52.080 --> 08:54.080
I meant to tell you about her, but...

08:54.160 --> 08:56.760
there never seemed to be
the right time to bring it up.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.640
And then things got complicated
after you kissed me, and--

08:59.720 --> 09:00.960
After I kissed you?

09:02.360 --> 09:03.920
After we kissed.

09:06.480 --> 09:10.080
I guess I was just afraid of telling you
'cause I thought it would ruin everything,

09:10.160 --> 09:14.560
-and then, of course...
-Hang on, Leo. Everything's cool.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.240
So we kissed.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.560
That happens between friends
and it's fine.

09:19.640 --> 09:23.080
You have a girlfriend from London
and she sings and makes you cookies.

09:23.160 --> 09:24.560
And it's cool.

09:25.680 --> 09:26.880
You're not mad at me?

09:28.280 --> 09:29.160
No.

09:31.640 --> 09:32.520
Okay.

09:33.120 --> 09:35.640
I mean, I was a bit surprised
to find out about it at first,

09:35.720 --> 09:38.280
but I got over it, and it's no biggie.

09:39.240 --> 09:40.560
Everything's fine.

09:42.760 --> 09:43.960
So, we're cool?

09:44.640 --> 09:46.480
Yeah. We're cool.

10:08.280 --> 10:09.200
[young Marcus] Let me get this straight.

10:09.280 --> 10:14.320
You discovered something, as usual,
but you won't tell me what you discovered.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.240
I just want to ask you
one question, Marcus.

10:17.240 --> 10:21.000
Is it possible for an object in the earth
to have magnetic polarity?

10:21.720 --> 10:24.080
Well, every object
has a certain level of polarity.

10:24.160 --> 10:25.800
It's just a question
of how you measure it.

10:25.880 --> 10:29.600
Have you ever encountered something
which was unusually magnetic?

10:29.680 --> 10:31.520
Say, like, in this area?

10:31.600 --> 10:32.880
Let me guess.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.520
You discovered the Einstein-Rosen bridge

10:35.600 --> 10:38.520
and you're actually a Ryan lookalike
from another dimension?

10:38.600 --> 10:42.040
I'll tell you everything, Marcus.
I just wanna check something first.

10:43.360 --> 10:45.080
Could you hand me that wrench, please?

10:46.000 --> 10:49.720
I also need a few things from you.
Like gloves, a flashlight, and a pickax.

11:16.120 --> 11:17.560
[sniffs]

11:31.720 --> 11:35.160
You know, I always thought you Greenhouse
students had way too much free time.

11:35.240 --> 11:38.440
[scoffs] Take my son, for instance,
with that Taser...

11:38.520 --> 11:41.280
Good thing you were able
to destroy the evidence.

11:41.360 --> 11:42.880
I wish he knew! [scoffs]

11:42.960 --> 11:46.000
You know, I don't think
he appreciates his mother enough.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.520
But we're not here
to talk about Daniel, right?

11:50.480 --> 11:51.560
[clicks tongue] No.

11:51.640 --> 11:55.280
[chuckles] We both know
why we're here, don't we?

11:56.000 --> 11:59.320
[scoffs] But did you really think
that I was gonna sit by quietly

11:59.400 --> 12:02.400
while you spread
all those rumors about me?

12:03.560 --> 12:05.200
Eric's working for you too?

12:05.280 --> 12:06.600
Mmm-hmm.

12:07.400 --> 12:10.600
[scoffs] Of course.
Everyone's working for you.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.680
Be grateful Eric was the only one
you confided in...

12:15.640 --> 12:17.240
or you wouldn't be sitting here.

12:19.360 --> 12:21.120
How can you do this to me?

12:21.880 --> 12:24.480
We've known each other for years.
I was Daniel's girlfriend.

12:26.440 --> 12:28.200
And you broke his heart.

12:29.560 --> 12:32.720
You deserve to be sitting here
just for that.

12:45.560 --> 12:48.960
My family used to
jet to Paris every holiday.

12:49.040 --> 12:51.240
And let me tell you...
[continues indistinctly]

12:51.320 --> 12:55.840
Can't you and your Warcraft buddies find
a cheat code to get you out of the cell?

12:55.920 --> 12:57.320
That's cheating.

12:57.400 --> 13:02.240
You'd rather listen to Aspen's
whole itinerary from her family vacation?

13:02.320 --> 13:04.440
Hello, it's called brainstorming.

13:05.040 --> 13:08.160
Aspen, I think you might be taking this
a little too seriously.

13:08.240 --> 13:11.200
Maybe it's time to wave the white flag
on this one? What do you think?

13:11.960 --> 13:13.600
[chuckles]

13:13.680 --> 13:15.560
My boyfriend, the genius!

13:15.640 --> 13:16.960
[grunts]

13:17.040 --> 13:18.880
-Oh, finally!
-What?

13:18.960 --> 13:21.720
The white flag!
You solved the riddle, Lee!

13:22.600 --> 13:24.440
-I did?
-Yes! Yes, you did!

13:24.520 --> 13:27.520
Okay. Here is the Dutch flag!

13:27.600 --> 13:31.560
So, red, white and blue stripes
are asleep, in the horizontal position.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.120
And, voilÃ !

13:33.200 --> 13:36.000
They wake up,
vertically, as the French flag!

13:36.080 --> 13:38.200
-Wow! That's it! Thanks!
-Yeah.

13:39.560 --> 13:42.040
Hey, guys. It's Kasparov2K.
I've found the solution.

13:42.120 --> 13:44.160
The three are red, blue, and white.

13:45.080 --> 13:49.440
It's so simple yet I never
would've thought of it in a million years.

13:49.520 --> 13:53.640
You see? We really do make
a perfect pair, you and I.

13:53.720 --> 13:55.280
I told you the Ravens could do it.

13:59.960 --> 14:01.480
-You see?
-Mmm.

14:01.560 --> 14:02.600
These are the three.

14:02.680 --> 14:04.080
The flags! [chuckles] Right!

14:05.200 --> 14:06.480
-Great riddle, Dad.
-Yeah.

14:07.360 --> 14:10.240
That's what I'm always talking about
when I talk about curiosity.

14:10.320 --> 14:13.000
When the kids are engaged,
they don't even need us.

14:14.200 --> 14:16.400
Oh... I wanna show this to Brooke.

14:18.200 --> 14:20.920
Remember how obsessed
she was with riddles as a kid?

14:21.000 --> 14:22.200
[line ringing]

14:22.280 --> 14:24.720
[Brooke on recording] Hey, it's Brooke.
Now, you say something.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.440
-[beeps]
-[sighs] Not answering.

14:27.320 --> 14:28.840
Must have a busy day today.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.080
I'm gonna make some tea.
Will you join me?

14:33.640 --> 14:35.120
I gotta go, Dad.

14:35.840 --> 14:36.840
Busy day too?

14:37.480 --> 14:38.640
Have a good one.

14:42.520 --> 14:45.240
You dug all of this by yourself?

14:46.360 --> 14:47.200
What for?

14:47.280 --> 14:49.400
-Give me your keys.
-Why?

14:49.480 --> 14:50.960
Give me your keys.

14:58.640 --> 14:59.840
A magnet?

15:00.480 --> 15:03.640
A magnet.
A hundred feet from the Greenhouse.

15:03.720 --> 15:07.080
I must have been here a thousand times.
I never noticed it.

15:07.160 --> 15:11.920
I checked all the records. There's not one
mention of a magnetic field in this area.

15:12.600 --> 15:15.560
I checked all the libraries,
real estate records,

15:15.640 --> 15:18.520
lab reports, microfilms, you name it.

15:18.600 --> 15:21.880
If this isn't some kind of trick,
you're gonna be very famous, my friend.

15:23.040 --> 15:26.000
To think how hard Louis had to work
to convince you to attend this school.

15:26.080 --> 15:27.280
[chuckles]

15:27.360 --> 15:28.800
[young Jason]
What are you guys doing here?

15:30.160 --> 15:31.960
[young Ryan] Hi, Jason.

15:32.040 --> 15:33.680
You're not supposed to be here.

15:33.760 --> 15:36.280
It's super late.
Just wait until I tell my dad.

15:36.360 --> 15:37.440
Jason, don't--

15:37.520 --> 15:39.320
Don't you think
I don't know all about you?

15:39.400 --> 15:40.920
My dad told me you were in prison once.

15:43.840 --> 15:44.680
Hang on, Jason.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.520
I bet you'd like to know
what we're doing here.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.960
-Can you keep a secret?
-Of course I can.

15:50.040 --> 15:53.760
Good. Do you know about
the dark magic of the Greenhouse cliffs?

15:53.840 --> 15:56.480
I'm not a kid anymore.
There's no such thing as magic.

15:58.680 --> 16:00.440
All right. Go ahead.

16:01.080 --> 16:03.360
Call your dad. I know we can't stop you.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.360
-What?
-Now do you see?

16:07.440 --> 16:08.920
[screaming]

16:09.000 --> 16:12.120
[chuckles] Don't worry about him.
I know Jason.

16:12.200 --> 16:15.280
He's so scared now,
he won't tell Louis a thing.

16:15.360 --> 16:16.440
Um...

16:17.160 --> 16:19.760
I'm sorry I never told you about my past.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.160
It's none of my business.

16:23.040 --> 16:25.080
Don't you wanna know why I was in prison?

16:25.920 --> 16:27.560
I know you're a good person.

16:28.360 --> 16:30.000
That's all that matters to me.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.360
You know what to do, right?

16:42.560 --> 16:43.760
Are you sure?

16:48.360 --> 16:50.360
What are you going to do to me?

16:50.440 --> 16:51.560
[alarm sounds in the distance]

16:53.120 --> 16:54.960
[Marcus] I think he wants in.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.320
What's going on?

16:57.920 --> 17:00.600
[Judy] No. I'll take care of this.

17:02.880 --> 17:03.720
[sighs]

17:10.400 --> 17:11.560
Where's Brooke?

17:11.640 --> 17:14.880
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Don't play with me, Judy!

17:14.960 --> 17:17.520
Family's where I draw the line.
I know you know where my sister is.

17:17.599 --> 17:18.640
I...

17:23.920 --> 17:26.920
I can assure you,
she's in very good hands.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.960
I want to see my sister!

17:31.440 --> 17:33.960
[chuckles] Okay.

17:34.960 --> 17:36.320
Yeah, you know, be my guest.

17:37.040 --> 17:40.480
I'm sure she'd love to know that
her brother's working with me too.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.000
What was so urgent?

18:01.760 --> 18:02.760
We need to talk.

18:03.320 --> 18:04.920
Did you do what I asked you?

18:05.000 --> 18:06.640
It's wrong, Judy.

18:06.720 --> 18:09.560
Ryan's mission is to have
all the magnetite in orbit.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.240
And your mission is to make sure

18:12.320 --> 18:14.560
only part of the magnetite
makes it on to the spacecraft.

18:15.320 --> 18:17.280
I'm not comfortable with this.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.480
But you're comfortable
taking my money, right?

18:21.360 --> 18:22.480
[sighs]

18:23.480 --> 18:24.880
Look, I told you.

18:24.960 --> 18:28.480
We can't afford to lose
all of the magnetite. It's too risky.

18:28.560 --> 18:31.000
But why would we lose it?

18:31.720 --> 18:35.160
[scoffs] Where were you, January 28, 1986?

18:36.000 --> 18:37.800
Accidents happen.

18:38.520 --> 18:40.600
-We have to tell Ryan about this.
-No.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.800
No. Why'd you bring up
the Challenger disaster?

18:43.880 --> 18:45.720
What is it that
you're not telling me, Judy?

18:45.800 --> 18:48.600
I'm paying you enough
not to have to tell you anything.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.800
Don't make me regret trusting you.

18:51.880 --> 18:55.040
So you betray Ryan
and then talk to me about trust?

18:56.560 --> 18:57.760
[chuckles]

18:59.640 --> 19:03.080
The only person who's been convicted
of treason in this room is you, Marcus.

19:03.160 --> 19:05.120
-I was framed.
-Mmm.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.080
[clicks tongue] The judge didn't think so.

19:08.280 --> 19:11.520
Well, look at you. You managed
to build a whole new life for yourself.

19:11.600 --> 19:14.520
It's a good thing your kids
don't know anything about your past,

19:15.120 --> 19:17.280
not even your real name.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.840
So that's your game? Blackmailing me?

19:22.600 --> 19:23.880
We had a deal.

19:24.960 --> 19:27.640
Do your part. That's all.

19:41.160 --> 19:42.200
[knocking at door]

19:46.440 --> 19:48.760
-Hey.
-Hey, I'm sorry for coming in this late.

19:48.840 --> 19:51.280
Oh, come on, I'm almost done packing.

19:51.360 --> 19:52.880
I just wanted to check in.

19:52.960 --> 19:55.360
-Is everything okay, Marcus?
-Yeah.

19:56.440 --> 19:58.600
I gotta tell you something.

19:58.680 --> 20:00.160
[chuckles] Okay.

20:00.240 --> 20:05.040
[sighs] Uh, you know about
the escape mechanism on the pod, right?

20:05.800 --> 20:07.000
Of course.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.160
Number of times I pulled it
during training.

20:09.240 --> 20:12.400
So, uh, you know what to do
in case something happens?

20:13.320 --> 20:14.480
[chuckles]

20:14.560 --> 20:16.960
You can be so overprotective sometimes.

20:17.720 --> 20:22.680
Just promise me
that if anything goes wrong,

20:22.760 --> 20:26.200
you'll activate the escape latch, okay?

20:29.200 --> 20:30.880
Will you promise me?

20:33.080 --> 20:35.720
Sure. I promise.

20:37.120 --> 20:38.160
Right.

20:38.240 --> 20:41.240
I knew you were special
the first day I met you.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.480
You've always looked out for me.

20:48.680 --> 20:50.640
I'll always take care of you.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.720
[Marcus] Come on, Ryan,
you can do it. I know it.

21:30.360 --> 21:31.200
Yes.

21:32.280 --> 21:33.960
[engine starts]

21:37.320 --> 21:38.720
[monitor beeping]

22:12.480 --> 22:13.680
[sighs]

22:33.880 --> 22:35.920
Brooke. Hey, where were you?

22:39.880 --> 22:40.880
Hey, babe.

22:41.480 --> 22:42.360
Hey.

22:45.680 --> 22:48.040
I made a terrible mistake, Daniel.
