Sunny Lee's daughter.

11:32.993 --> 11:35.863
They told me downstairs
that you're
my mother's doctor.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.965
DR. MELENDEZ: Yes.
Get them to send her records

11:38.031 --> 11:39.466
and everything they can
about the device.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.334
Manufacturer,
model number, manuals.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.805
Your mother's stable,
but we're struggling

11:44.872 --> 11:47.808
to get the information we need
from her doctor in China.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.642
I don't understand.
Her doctor's in China?

11:49.709 --> 11:51.378
Like on vacation?

11:51.444 --> 11:53.981
No, her cardiac surgeon.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.549
Your sister can fill
you in on everything
we've done so far.

11:56.616 --> 11:59.152
I really need to get back
on this phone call.
Wait.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.988
I don't have a sister.

12:11.765 --> 12:14.701
We met 10 years ago
while I was volunteering
at a senior center.

12:15.535 --> 12:16.970
We hit it off.

12:17.037 --> 12:19.306
Neither of us had anyone
in our lives at the time.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.076
People assumed we were
mother and daughter

12:23.143 --> 12:25.612
because we did
everything together.

12:25.678 --> 12:27.314
After a while,
we just went with it.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.118
She'll be glad
to see you.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.186
You look like you've put
your problems behind you.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.055
Problems?

12:35.122 --> 12:36.689
She told me about
your issues with drugs.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.628
Oh, my God.

12:41.694 --> 12:43.864
She caught me
smoking pot.

12:43.931 --> 12:46.233
Once.
I was a teenager.

12:46.299 --> 12:49.669
So you're fine?
Of course I'm fine.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.171
Then you don't
really have an excuse

12:51.238 --> 12:53.540
for not calling
for 15 years,
do you?

12:58.111 --> 12:59.279
DR. MELENDEZ:
They want her back.

12:59.346 --> 13:00.513
They've arranged
for transport...

13:00.580 --> 13:01.949
They'll do
the repairs in Beijing.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.516
Is that safe?

13:03.583 --> 13:05.352
Can she travel for that long
in her condition?

13:05.418 --> 13:06.820
It's a specially-equipped
plane for patients

13:06.887 --> 13:08.688
requiring urgent
medical assistance.

13:08.755 --> 13:10.357
And 20 hours in the air
is much safer

13:10.423 --> 13:12.392
than at least that long
on an operating table here

13:12.459 --> 13:13.760
while we basically
fly blind.

it will help us avoid
the speech center

there hasn't been a day
I haven't thought about you.

missed you.

37:55.240 --> 37:58.777
You were singing
I Wish It Would Rain
with that band.

38:04.950 --> 38:06.284
I cried.

38:07.853 --> 38:09.521
It was beautiful.

Can you tell me
your name?

39:02.574 --> 39:04.275
You remember
your name?

Of course I remember
my name...

Lana.

39:16.154 --> 39:19.090
And you're Javi.

I think I love you.

39:28.333 --> 39:30.101
I think you do, too.

39:37.208 --> 39:40.479
Do you want to
stay in bed with me
