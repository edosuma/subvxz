00:02.764 --> 00:03.998
Hey.

00:04.066 --> 00:06.901
Could I get your
lucretia mott on this?

00:06.968 --> 00:07.902
What is this?

00:07.969 --> 00:08.969
Budget approval

00:09.037 --> 00:10.471
for travel and hotels for the moms.

00:10.539 --> 00:11.872
The moms? What moms?

00:11.940 --> 00:13.040
The staff moms

00:13.108 --> 00:14.842
that are gonna be on
the mother's day show

00:14.910 --> 00:16.677
that nbc is making us do

00:16.745 --> 00:17.912
after their ill-fated decision

00:17.979 --> 00:19.680
to re-air the pilot of
<i>bitch hunter.</i>

00:24.886 --> 00:26.387
Put the mimosas down!

00:26.455 --> 00:27.755
Bitch.

00:27.823 --> 00:29.757
Wait, it's mother's day already?

00:29.825 --> 00:31.892
Did you forget?
Colleen is gonna kill you.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.627
There's still time. Jonathan.

00:33.695 --> 00:36.430
Jonathan, call the florist,
and order a dozen--no.

00:36.498 --> 00:38.899
Necktie. Too late, Jackie.

Hey, why isn't my beautiful
Frank up on the wall?

01:01.976 --> 01:03.577
Ma, come on,
that's just for the actors.

01:03.645 --> 01:05.479
Oh, here's a picture you can use.

01:05.547 --> 01:08.315
It's little Frankie in the bathtub,

01:08.383 --> 01:09.983
getting ready for the senior prom.

01:10.051 --> 01:13.020
Thank you.

01:14.756 --> 01:15.956
Mom, what are you doing?

01:16.024 --> 01:17.825
You don't have to pay for the food.

01:17.892 --> 01:19.360
Honey, nothing is free.

01:19.427 --> 01:20.928
You remember that

01:20.995 --> 01:23.263
when a man buys you
an expensive meal.

01:23.331 --> 01:24.598
Yeah, that's happening a lot.

01:24.666 --> 01:25.866
Hey, verna.

01:25.934 --> 01:28.102
Well, you must remember
my mom, Margaret.

01:28.169 --> 01:29.436
Oh, yes, we met a few years ago

01:29.504 --> 01:31.505
when the girls lived in Chicago.

01:31.573 --> 01:34.441
You must have me confused
with someone else.

01:34.509 --> 01:37.311
I have never been to Chicago.

01:37.379 --> 01:40.981
I sexually assaulted
scottie pippen in 1997.

01:41.049 --> 01:42.015
There's my baby!

01:42.083 --> 01:44.151
Oh, mommy!

01:44.219 --> 01:46.820
Look, Tracy, this mother's
day show is tomorrow,

01:46.888 --> 01:48.789
and we haven't been able
to track down your mom.

01:48.857 --> 01:50.491
I gave Kenneth her information.

01:50.558 --> 01:51.859
"Her name might be Cheryl,

01:51.926 --> 01:54.828
and she was wearing a
red shirt in 1984."

01:54.896 --> 01:56.397
Look, I don't want you
to be alone up there

01:56.464 --> 01:57.631
with all the families,

01:57.699 --> 02:00.834
so what if I hire an
actress to play your mom?

02:00.902 --> 02:02.169
Okay.

02:02.237 --> 02:03.337
But whoever she is

02:03.405 --> 02:05.406
needs to be someone
as amazing as I am.

02:05.473 --> 02:07.975
I want to see a list of names.

02:08.042 --> 02:10.610
Like when they was looking for
John mccain's running mate.

02:12.313 --> 02:13.247
I'm kidding.

02:13.314 --> 02:16.183
This needs to be taken seriously.

02:18.653 --> 02:20.020
Happy mother's day, Colleen.

02:20.088 --> 02:22.856
I'm not here about mother's day,
John Francis.

02:22.924 --> 02:25.292
You know who's in my
water aerobics class

02:25.360 --> 02:26.427
down in Florida?

02:26.494 --> 02:27.995
Yes, mother,
I've memorized the names

02:28.062 --> 02:29.963
of everyone in your
water aerobics class.

02:30.031 --> 02:31.198
Patricia goodband,

02:31.266 --> 02:34.334
whose sister runs the
Friday night bingo game

02:34.402 --> 02:36.603
at our lady of
reluctant integration

02:36.671 --> 02:38.172
in waltham.

02:38.239 --> 02:39.373
Turns out last week

02:39.441 --> 02:42.342
that the game was won
by Anne o'connor,

02:42.410 --> 02:45.345
who mentioned that her niece,

02:45.413 --> 02:48.515
Nancy Donovan, got divorced

02:48.583 --> 02:50.250
and was running around

02:50.318 --> 02:52.519
with a hotshot in New York City

02:52.587 --> 02:54.788
who pours scotch like a woman.

02:54.856 --> 02:55.823
If I don't always share

02:55.890 --> 02:57.424
my personal life with you, Colleen,

02:57.492 --> 03:00.060
it's becse you've never
approved of any woman

03:00.128 --> 03:01.261
I've shown an interest in.

03:01.329 --> 03:02.763
Now, that's not true.

03:02.831 --> 03:04.898
I'm not having this
conversation with you right now.

03:04.966 --> 03:06.900
I have work to do,
and I'll be joining you for lunch.

03:06.968 --> 03:09.236
In the meantime,
Kenneth here will entertain you.

03:09.304 --> 03:12.039
Okay, Kenneth, entertain me.

03:12.106 --> 03:14.241
♪ Oh, the fiddle's in the creek ♪

03:14.309 --> 03:15.476
♪ and the frog's in the kitchen ♪

03:15.543 --> 03:17.778
I apologize, ma'am.
That is not a song.

03:17.846 --> 03:19.646
You make me very nervous.
Oh, my God.

03:21.816 --> 03:24.985
Hey, lutz, this is my mom, miho.

03:25.053 --> 03:26.720
Oh, hi.

03:26.788 --> 03:29.323
I didn't know you were adopted.

03:29.390 --> 03:30.324
What?

03:30.391 --> 03:32.526
Thanks a lot, lutz.

03:36.264 --> 03:38.699
Mom, this is Lee.

03:38.766 --> 03:40.734
He's the head of our
wardrobe department.

03:40.802 --> 03:42.402
Well, hello, Lee.

03:42.470 --> 03:44.538
Wrong tree, mom. Gotcha.

03:44.606 --> 03:46.573
So Lee's gonna take care of
your clothes for the show.

03:46.641 --> 03:49.009
Oh, no, no,
that won't be necessary.

03:49.077 --> 03:50.577
I brought some real cute duds.

03:50.645 --> 03:54.248
I made us both rompers to wear.

03:54.315 --> 03:55.682
Excuse me.

03:55.750 --> 04:01.822
My...Friend has to go
strangle her anxiety pillow.

04:01.890 --> 04:03.891
Lee, it's the bridesmaid's dress.

04:03.958 --> 04:04.892
I can't breathe.

04:04.959 --> 04:06.560
I'm gonna die in here.

04:06.628 --> 04:08.028
Bridesmaid?

04:08.096 --> 04:10.597
It's bad luck for a married
woman to be a bridesmaid.

04:10.665 --> 04:12.699
It brings fever and disease.

04:12.767 --> 04:14.801
Yeah, well, I'm not
actually married, so...

04:14.869 --> 04:16.103
Not even common law?

04:16.170 --> 04:18.505
How do you get credit
at a mattress store?

04:18.572 --> 04:20.240
You know, my Johnny's single,

04:20.308 --> 04:22.009
and he gives excellent backrubs,

04:22.076 --> 04:23.010
I can assure you.

04:23.077 --> 04:24.344
Thank you, Mrs. lutz,

04:24.412 --> 04:26.013
and thank you, moms,
for your interest,

04:26.080 --> 04:28.282
but I just haven't met the one yet.

04:28.349 --> 04:30.384
Oh, for crying out loud, Liz.

04:30.451 --> 04:32.886
You see? That's what feminism does.

04:32.954 --> 04:36.290
It makes smart girls
with nice birthing shapes

04:36.357 --> 04:37.858
believe in fairytales.

04:37.926 --> 04:40.427
Stop waiting for your prince, Liz.

04:40.495 --> 04:42.262
I'm not waiting for a prince.

04:42.330 --> 04:45.532
I'm waiting for
astronaut Mike Dexter.

04:45.600 --> 04:46.934
Oh, sweet lord in heaven.

04:47.001 --> 04:49.636
Who turns out to be the
secret king of Monaco.

04:49.704 --> 04:51.138
Liz, you're almost 40.

04:51.205 --> 04:53.907
You're not gonna find
some new kind of man.

04:53.975 --> 04:55.475
Whoever the one is,

04:55.543 --> 04:58.145
you probably already met him.

04:58.212 --> 04:59.980
You're 40?

05:00.048 --> 05:01.381
John is looking for a...

05:01.449 --> 05:04.084
Greener banana, so...

05:11.059 --> 05:12.092
Hello, verna.

05:12.160 --> 05:13.093
Glad to see you're here,

05:13.161 --> 05:14.494
upholding your end of our bargain.

05:14.562 --> 05:15.596
Oh, yeah.

05:15.663 --> 05:16.797
I'm being a great mother--

05:16.864 --> 05:18.599
listening, giving advice,

05:18.666 --> 05:21.234
asking stupid questions
during movies.

05:21.302 --> 05:24.972
But I need you to hold up your end.

05:25.039 --> 05:26.740
That money order you sent,

05:26.808 --> 05:28.642
that was only for half.

05:28.710 --> 05:29.843
That was a down payment, verna.

05:29.911 --> 05:31.244
You'll get the rest

05:31.312 --> 05:33.280
after you've fulfilled
your mother's day duties.

05:33.348 --> 05:34.548
That's kind of a problem for me,

05:34.616 --> 05:36.583
'cause I already spent
that down payment

05:36.651 --> 05:39.119
on the first half of my boob job.

05:39.187 --> 05:41.221
It's not an implant.

05:41.289 --> 05:42.990
It's just a little yank up,
you know?

05:43.057 --> 05:46.159
I mean, I got the meat, Jack.

05:46.227 --> 05:47.928
Go ahead. Feel 'em.
Feel the difference.

05:47.996 --> 05:49.896
Very different indeed.

05:49.964 --> 05:51.765
Like a cantaloupe

05:51.833 --> 05:55.802
and a ziploc bag of mushroom soup.

05:55.870 --> 05:57.471
But you're not getting
the rest of that money

05:57.538 --> 05:59.840
until you give Jenna all the
mother's day love she deserves.

05:59.907 --> 06:01.475
Whatever.

06:01.542 --> 06:04.878
Narc.

06:04.946 --> 06:06.079
Good news, tray.

06:06.147 --> 06:07.547
We found a great mom for you.

06:07.615 --> 06:09.616
Her name is novella Nelson.

06:09.684 --> 06:10.717
Novella Nelson?

06:10.785 --> 06:13.220
Oh, wait, is she
aquaman's girlfriend?

06:13.287 --> 06:15.656
No. She's a great actress
who lives in Brooklyn.

06:15.723 --> 06:16.657
She looks like you.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.058
That could be anyone!

06:18.126 --> 06:19.459
We all look the same to me.

06:19.527 --> 06:20.527
Is she famous?

06:20.595 --> 06:21.662
You'd probably know her best

06:21.729 --> 06:23.096
from a commercial they air a lot

06:23.164 --> 06:25.198
during the 3:30 A.M. <i>sportscenter.</i>

06:25.266 --> 06:27.634
Ugh, these overalls are chafing.

06:27.702 --> 06:30.370
I can't wear these pajamas fishing!

06:30.438 --> 06:31.772
Female announcer: Pajamaralls.

06:31.839 --> 06:33.907
Pajamaralways.

06:33.975 --> 06:35.308
What about the list I gave you?

06:35.376 --> 06:37.144
Phylicia rashad. Serena Williams.

06:37.211 --> 06:39.546
They're too recognizable, Tracy.

06:39.614 --> 06:41.415
And Serena Williams
is younger than you.

06:41.482 --> 06:44.084
Who cares? She's awesome,
and so am I.

06:44.152 --> 06:46.086
I want Serena Williams
to be my mother.

06:46.154 --> 06:47.320
We've already booked novella.

06:47.388 --> 06:49.289
The woman's been in the
business for 40 years.

06:49.357 --> 06:52.092
I think she's good enough for the
star of <i>sherlock homie.</i>

06:55.463 --> 06:56.997
I know what you're
thinking, mother,

06:57.065 --> 06:58.765
and we are not talking
about Nancy Donovan.

06:58.833 --> 07:01.068
I don't want to talk
about Nancy Donovan.

07:01.135 --> 07:04.204
I want to talk about
the little blonde girl

07:04.272 --> 07:05.572
that you are sleeping with.

07:05.640 --> 07:06.907
What?

07:06.974 --> 07:09.209
A mother knows, Jackie.

07:09.277 --> 07:11.712
Oh, hi. Are you going up?

07:11.779 --> 07:12.846
Down, actually.

07:12.914 --> 07:14.181
Ugh, I forgot my phone.

07:15.616 --> 07:18.285
Two women, Jack, at the same time.

07:18.352 --> 07:20.287
What are you, Italian?

07:20.354 --> 07:22.522
I didn't choose for it
to happen like this.

07:22.590 --> 07:24.691
Be a man and pick one.

07:24.759 --> 07:26.760
I can't. They both give
me different things.

07:26.828 --> 07:28.562
One connects me to the man I was.

07:28.629 --> 07:30.030
The other...

07:30.098 --> 07:31.565
Inspires.

07:31.632 --> 07:33.400
Just listen to yourself, Jack.

07:33.468 --> 07:35.635
I know it's gay,
but it's my gay problem,

07:35.703 --> 07:38.705
and I'm handling it.

07:38.773 --> 07:40.907
We're ready to order now.

07:40.975 --> 07:43.176
Just bring my son
one of everything.

07:43.244 --> 07:45.278
That way, he doesn't
have to choose.

07:47.615 --> 07:48.749
Hey.

07:48.816 --> 07:51.785
Um, why was I given this
to wear on the show?

07:51.853 --> 07:53.553
Well, I loved your idea

07:53.621 --> 07:55.288
that we both wear the same outfit.

07:55.356 --> 07:58.091
I just thought this one
might be more...Tv friendly.

07:58.159 --> 07:59.926
You mean instead of the rompers

07:59.994 --> 08:01.628
that your mother slaved over.

08:01.696 --> 08:03.930
Mom, this isn't Florida.

08:03.998 --> 08:05.465
You're damn right it isn't.

08:05.533 --> 08:08.502
In Florida, everybody's
always asking me,

08:08.569 --> 08:10.637
"where did you get that?
You made it?

08:10.705 --> 08:13.573
Holy crap! Where do
I commission one?"

08:13.641 --> 08:16.943
Oh. This is about you
making money selling junk.

08:18.579 --> 08:20.080
Verna, this is my job,

08:20.148 --> 08:21.548
and I know you don't
understand that,

08:21.616 --> 08:23.316
'cause you haven't had
a job in 15 years.

08:23.384 --> 08:24.785
Because of my back.

08:24.852 --> 08:26.520
Because of the trampoline accident.

08:26.587 --> 08:28.455
But I need to look a
certain way on tv.

08:28.523 --> 08:31.158
You are nothing but a spoiled brat.

08:31.225 --> 08:32.458
You know what?

08:32.527 --> 08:33.592
Here's what I think of you

08:33.660 --> 08:35.796
and your fancy clothes.

08:38.866 --> 08:42.169
That is quality stitching.

08:42.236 --> 08:45.906
Damn the tiny,
brown hands that made this.

08:50.645 --> 08:51.978
Oh, there you are.

08:52.046 --> 08:54.581
Just thought I'd tidy up.

08:54.649 --> 08:55.582
That's my computer.

08:55.650 --> 08:56.850
Oh, no, honey.

08:56.918 --> 08:59.786
A computer is a great big
thing with a green screen.

08:59.854 --> 09:03.924
Mom, do you think it's weird

09:03.991 --> 09:05.325
that I'm still single?

09:05.393 --> 09:08.662
Well, your standards are very high.

09:08.729 --> 09:09.663
As they should be.

09:09.730 --> 09:12.666
I remember someone who got a three

09:12.733 --> 09:15.001
on her history ap test.

09:15.069 --> 09:16.536
But do I expect too much?

09:16.604 --> 09:17.737
Maybe the moms were right.

09:17.805 --> 09:19.272
Maybe I should have just settled.

09:19.340 --> 09:21.441
I can't tell you what to do, Liz,

09:21.509 --> 09:24.678
but I know from
experience that that gu

09:24.745 --> 09:27.547
that perfect guy, is out there.

09:27.615 --> 09:29.883
'Cause I know I found mine.

09:29.951 --> 09:31.384
See, that's all I want.

09:31.452 --> 09:32.652
What you and dad have.

09:32.720 --> 09:34.821
Oh, I'm not talking
about your father.

09:34.889 --> 09:36.189
What?

09:38.426 --> 09:39.893
what do you mean you're
not talking about dad?

09:40.039 --> 09:41.205
You love dad. Of course I do,

09:41.273 --> 09:43.607
but Dick lemon isn't ed.

09:43.639 --> 09:44.739
Ed? Who's ed?

09:44.807 --> 09:47.709
Ed was my true love, sweetheart.

09:47.776 --> 09:50.778
He was my steady at montclair high.

09:50.846 --> 09:53.214
The night before he was
shipped off to Korea,

09:53.282 --> 09:56.117
I repeatedly lost
my virginity to him,

09:56.185 --> 09:58.620
while Waldo, the town perv,

09:58.687 --> 10:00.021
watched from the bushes.

10:00.089 --> 10:01.155
Wait, what?

10:01.223 --> 10:03.458
Nothing, younger me. It's fine.

10:03.525 --> 10:05.226
He wanted to get married,

10:05.294 --> 10:06.794
but when he was invited to Houston

10:06.862 --> 10:08.396
for his astronaut training--

10:08.464 --> 10:09.864
he was an astronaut?

10:09.932 --> 10:11.633
You could have been
an astronaut's wife?

10:11.700 --> 10:13.768
It wasn't that simple, Liz.

10:13.836 --> 10:17.071
I had just graduated
from secretary school,

10:17.139 --> 10:19.274
and I got a job at sterling Cooper.

10:19.341 --> 10:21.476
I couldn't just pick up and move.

10:21.543 --> 10:24.112
I was already 26, an old maid.

10:24.179 --> 10:25.446
Different times. Octomom.

10:25.514 --> 10:28.283
So I settled for a wonderful man,

10:28.350 --> 10:30.585
and I have never regretted it.

10:30.653 --> 10:34.455
Not even when I watched ed
aldrin walk on the moon.

10:34.523 --> 10:38.293
Wait, your ed is buzz aldrin?

10:38.360 --> 10:40.161
Yeah, but I always called him ed,

10:40.229 --> 10:43.264
because our town had,
like, five buzzes.

10:43.332 --> 10:45.366
You could have married buzz aldrin?

10:45.434 --> 10:47.835
You should regret that, mom.

10:47.903 --> 10:49.337
You should have followed him.

10:49.405 --> 10:50.838
Laura linney could have played you

10:50.906 --> 10:54.542
in the hbo original
movie <i>moon wives!</i>

10:55.878 --> 10:57.979
Where are you going, verna?

10:58.047 --> 10:59.547
Oh, I quit.

10:59.615 --> 11:01.582
I've been working my ass off

11:01.650 --> 11:03.685
pretending to be a good mom,

11:03.752 --> 11:05.553
but Jenna doesn't appreciate it.

11:05.621 --> 11:06.954
I see.

11:07.022 --> 11:09.023
Well, then good luck paying
for that other implant.

11:09.091 --> 11:10.992
It's not an implant, Jack.

11:11.060 --> 11:12.026
I mean, I got the meat.

11:12.094 --> 11:13.861
Of course. I apologize.

11:13.929 --> 11:16.364
Verna, you have a very
simple decision to make--

11:16.432 --> 11:18.032
quit, don't get paid,

11:18.100 --> 11:19.767
and drive around with
one headlight out,

11:19.835 --> 11:21.269
or, swallow your pride,

11:21.337 --> 11:25.573
and get the money
you need tomorrow.

11:25.641 --> 11:28.609
They said they were gonna
put a wig on me or something

11:28.677 --> 11:30.311
so that nobody would recognize me

11:30.379 --> 11:31.646
as the pajamarall lady.

11:31.714 --> 11:34.048
Like anyone would
recognize you anyway.

11:34.116 --> 11:35.550
I'm sorry. What did you say?

11:35.617 --> 11:38.119
You are way beneath me, novella.

11:38.187 --> 11:40.555
I am a movie star,
a television actor,

11:40.622 --> 11:42.690
and a guinness book
of world record holder

11:42.758 --> 11:45.093
for most car accidents
in a single year.

11:45.160 --> 11:47.061
Maybe you wanted someone
more high-profile,

11:47.129 --> 11:48.429
but I am what you got,

11:48.497 --> 11:50.465
so, Tracy, you better
watch yourself,

11:50.532 --> 11:52.867
or you may wind up
with no mother at all.

11:52.935 --> 11:56.637
Fine. I'd rather be up
on that stage all alone

11:56.705 --> 11:57.905
than to be with someone

11:57.973 --> 12:01.242
whose resume has "black
judge" on it nine times.

12:01.310 --> 12:03.177
And you think I wanted a fake son

12:03.245 --> 12:06.214
who recorded an anti-condom psa?

12:06.281 --> 12:08.616
I saved a lot of
kids from lame sex!

12:08.684 --> 12:10.485
Little ingrate.

12:14.289 --> 12:15.723
All right, start with taxes,

12:15.791 --> 12:17.925
then insurance, and change this to "
latin America."

12:17.993 --> 12:21.062
I can't say Nicaragua.

12:21.130 --> 12:22.397
Gah!

12:22.464 --> 12:23.531
You must be Avery.

12:23.599 --> 12:24.766
Yes?

12:24.833 --> 12:27.034
I am so sorry, miss Jessup.

12:27.102 --> 12:29.137
Mrs. Donaghy keeps tricking
me and running away,

12:29.204 --> 12:30.471
but not anymore.

12:30.539 --> 12:33.107
Carl, they need you
out in the hall.

12:33.175 --> 12:34.709
Yes, ma'am!

12:34.777 --> 12:36.978
Mrs. Donaghy.

12:37.045 --> 12:38.379
You must be Jack's mother.

12:38.447 --> 12:39.480
Indeed, I am.

12:39.548 --> 12:42.417
And Jack has told me
so much about you.

12:42.484 --> 12:45.253
You're going to have
to work your backside,

12:45.320 --> 12:46.921
because chest-wise

12:46.989 --> 12:49.824
you have the measurements
of an altar boy.

12:49.892 --> 12:51.626
I wish Jack had told
me you were in town.

12:51.693 --> 12:54.395
Well, men have their
little secrets, don't they?

12:54.463 --> 12:55.830
Especially Jack.

12:55.898 --> 12:56.831
Secrets?

12:56.899 --> 12:58.266
What I'm trying to say is,

12:58.333 --> 12:59.934
if you're serious about Jackie,

13:00.002 --> 13:01.669
let him know now.

13:01.737 --> 13:04.806
A man like Jack has
other irons in the fire.

13:04.873 --> 13:05.973
I beg your pardon?

13:06.041 --> 13:08.576
Oh! Look at the time.

13:08.644 --> 13:12.914
I've got to get back to
calling Kenneth "carl"

13:12.981 --> 13:15.450
to see if he ever corrects me.

13:15.517 --> 13:17.118
Carl!

13:17.186 --> 13:18.519
Yes, ma'am?

13:22.724 --> 13:23.991
Lemon, have you seen Colleen?<,

13:24.059 --> 13:25.660
Kenneth was supposed
to be watching her,

13:25.727 --> 13:27.128
but I just saw him
with his eyes closed

13:27.196 --> 13:28.196
counting to infinity.

13:28.263 --> 13:30.164
You want to talk about moms, Jack?

13:30.232 --> 13:31.332
Listen to this.

13:31.400 --> 13:35.102
My mother could have
married buzz aldrin.

13:35.170 --> 13:36.170
Oh, really? I know buzz.

13:36.238 --> 13:37.572
We met at a photo shoot

13:37.639 --> 13:40.341
for <i>vanity fair's</i> annual
awesome gentleman issue.

13:40.409 --> 13:41.876
My mom blew it, Jack.

13:41.944 --> 13:44.378
She had true love,
and she threw it away

13:44.446 --> 13:46.547
just because it was inconvenient.

13:46.615 --> 13:48.349
Well, lemon, if your mom
had ended up with buzz,

13:48.417 --> 13:49.550
you would have never been born.

13:49.618 --> 13:52.386
Or I would have been
born Peter aldrin.

13:52.454 --> 13:54.856
And I+d wait for a woman
with the right stuff.

13:54.923 --> 13:56.257
Now, remember, in this scenario,

13:56.325 --> 13:57.992
I'm a man and my
father is an astronaut.

13:58.060 --> 13:59.360
Well, lemon, if you'd like to see

13:59.428 --> 14:00.695
what your mom's life
would have been,

14:00.762 --> 14:01.829
I can arrange for you to meet buzz.

14:01.897 --> 14:03.364
Are you serious? He's in town.

14:03.432 --> 14:05.566
I saw him last night at Rupert
Murdoch's twister party.

14:05.634 --> 14:09.504
I mean, uh, regular party.

14:09.571 --> 14:12.974
Tracy, this mother's day
thing is a disaster.

14:13.041 --> 14:14.041
I hear you.

14:14.109 --> 14:15.376
Because you're talking in the ear

14:15.444 --> 14:16.644
that I didn't lose a button in.

14:16.712 --> 14:19.847
I thought verna and I had
made this breakthrough,

14:19.915 --> 14:20.915
but now we're just back

14:20.983 --> 14:22.183
to fighting about
money and clothes.

14:22.251 --> 14:23.718
Thank God Terry's dead,

14:23.785 --> 14:25.419
or we'd be fighting
over him again too.

14:25.487 --> 14:28.556
Boy, I thought I had it
bad with my fake mom.

14:28.624 --> 14:29.657
Are you kidding?

14:29.725 --> 14:30.791
At least your fake mom

14:30.859 --> 14:32.360
has to act like she
cares about you.

14:32.427 --> 14:33.794
Yeah, it's true.

14:33.862 --> 14:35.062
And she is a good actress.

14:35.130 --> 14:37.398
I bought those pajamaralls.

14:37.466 --> 14:38.699
And you got to choose her.

14:38.767 --> 14:42.203
No, Jenna, no one gets
to choose their mom...

14:42.271 --> 14:43.638
Even when they're fake.

14:43.705 --> 14:45.039
For good or bad,

14:45.107 --> 14:46.240
we're stuck with them.

14:46.308 --> 14:47.708
And you know what?

14:47.776 --> 14:50.177
They don't get to choose
who we are, either.

14:50.245 --> 14:52.580
And God knows we're not perfect.

14:52.648 --> 14:54.115
It's true.

14:54.182 --> 14:58.653
Sometimes I sing too beautifully.

14:58.720 --> 14:59.954
What a nice surpri--

15:00.022 --> 15:01.389
is there another woman?

15:01.456 --> 15:03.624
What? How did you--? Colleen.

15:03.692 --> 15:04.926
Don't blame your mother, Jack.

15:04.993 --> 15:06.260
This is about us.

15:06.328 --> 15:09.063
Oh, my God. Look, Avery,
you know how I feel.

15:09.131 --> 15:11.232
So I'm gonna skip the part
where I deny anything.

15:11.300 --> 15:13.534
Then you skip the part
where you yell at me.

15:13.602 --> 15:16.971
And then we both move on to the,
uh, make-up sex.

15:17.039 --> 15:17.972
Wow.

15:18.040 --> 15:19.373
That is a swing.

15:19.441 --> 15:22.710
Look, I assumed you
and I were exclusive,

15:22.778 --> 15:24.412
but we never talked about it,

15:24.479 --> 15:27.448
so maybe this is partly my fault.

15:27.516 --> 15:29.250
And I forgive you. Come here.

15:29.318 --> 15:30.985
I'm sorry.

15:31.053 --> 15:33.888
But these tactics have
worked on stupider women.

15:33.956 --> 15:35.489
If we're going to move forward,

15:35.557 --> 15:38.926
you better figure out
what it is you want.

15:38.994 --> 15:41.095
Soon.

15:43.899 --> 15:46.400
Excuse me, Dr. aldrin.

15:46.468 --> 15:48.102
I'm sorry. There wasn't a door,
so I just...

15:48.170 --> 15:49.270
I don't believe in barriers,

15:49.338 --> 15:51.405
because I always break them.

15:51.473 --> 15:52.440
You must be Liz.

15:52.507 --> 15:53.574
Yes, sir.

15:53.642 --> 15:56.344
I actually came about my mother,
Margaret lemon.

15:56.411 --> 15:58.613
Well, you would have known
her as Margaret Freeman.

15:58.680 --> 16:01.315
Maggie Freeman?
Of course I remember her.

16:01.383 --> 16:02.550
Well, I'm sorry to bother you,

16:02.618 --> 16:05.152
but I can't help but
wonder what my mom lost

16:05.220 --> 16:06.954
by giving up on you,

16:07.022 --> 16:08.723
her perfect man.

16:08.790 --> 16:10.791
Perfect? Sure,
I'm a famous astronaut,

16:10.859 --> 16:15.429
decorated fighter pilot,
doctorate from mit,

16:15.497 --> 16:17.598
but even I sometimes...

16:17.666 --> 16:20.001
I see you. I see what you're doing.

16:20.068 --> 16:23.838
Return to the night.
You've no business here.

16:23.905 --> 16:25.506
Are you yelling at the moon?

16:25.574 --> 16:27.541
I'm sorry. She and I just...

16:27.609 --> 16:29.977
I get mad sometimes.

16:30.045 --> 16:31.245
Sure.

16:31.313 --> 16:33.247
Look, you want to know
what your mother missed?

16:33.315 --> 16:36.050
Years of drinking,
depression, cheating.

16:36.118 --> 16:39.286
I flipped over a saab in
the San Fernando valley.

16:39.354 --> 16:42.223
I once woke up in the
air and space museum

16:42.290 --> 16:45.660
with a revolver in the
waistband of my Jean shorts.

16:45.727 --> 16:47.528
Oh, my God. But you're--

16:47.596 --> 16:48.729
a human being.

16:48.797 --> 16:50.297
But I'm at peace now.

16:50.365 --> 16:52.667
Sober almost 32 years.

16:52.734 --> 16:57.038
But I would have put Maggie
Freeman through hell.

16:58.607 --> 17:00.174
The moms were right.

17:00.242 --> 17:04.078
There's no such thing as
astronaut Mike Dexter.

17:04.146 --> 17:05.311
What am I doing?

17:05.380 --> 17:07.647
I'm sorry if I've disappointed you.

17:07.715 --> 17:10.751
Would you like to yell at
the moon with buzz aldrin?

17:10.819 --> 17:13.854
Yes, please.

17:13.922 --> 17:15.122
I own you!

17:15.190 --> 17:16.589
You dumb moon!

17:16.657 --> 17:18.291
I walked on your face!

17:18.359 --> 17:19.660
Don't you know it's day?

17:19.728 --> 17:22.063
Idiot!

17:22.130 --> 17:24.531
Well, I'm ready for the show.

17:24.598 --> 17:28.102
Mom, you're wearing my outfit.

17:28.170 --> 17:30.304
Well, a mother makes sacrifices.

17:30.372 --> 17:33.374
Like those 16 hours
I spent in labor,

17:33.442 --> 17:35.409
even though it was Margarita Monday

17:35.477 --> 17:38.012
at dockside Joe's.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.214
Daughters make sacrifices too.

17:40.282 --> 17:43.217
Why are you wearing that?
Who's paying you?

17:43.285 --> 17:44.752
No one.

17:44.820 --> 17:48.222
I'm wearing it for the same
reason you're wearing mine.

17:48.290 --> 17:50.324
Because I love you.

17:50.392 --> 17:53.127
I love you too, baby girl. Oh.

17:53.195 --> 17:54.862
Why does your chest feel weird?

Uh, because I love you so much.

18:35.971 --> 18:37.671
So am I, dear.

18:37.739 --> 18:40.441
Now, would you please
find yourself someone

18:40.509 --> 18:41.776
and start a family

19:00.295 --> 19:01.629
I am 51 years old.

19:01.696 --> 19:02.863
Do you not think I can take care

19:02.931 --> 19:04.231
of my own personal life?

19:04.299 --> 19:05.766
Think? I know you can't.

19:05.834 --> 19:07.535
You do a lot of things well--

19:07.602 --> 19:10.838
make money, choose wine, wear ties.

19:10.906 --> 19:13.574
But you and women? Disaster.

19:13.642 --> 19:15.442
Divorce. Broken engagements.

19:15.510 --> 19:17.144
I assume herpes.

19:17.212 --> 19:18.546
And I wonder why I'm like that.

19:18.613 --> 19:19.947
Maybe it's because you can't let go

19:20.015 --> 19:21.549
of your precious Jackie,

19:21.616 --> 19:23.217
so you undermine me at every turn.

19:23.285 --> 19:24.985
I'm not gonna be around forever.

19:25.053 --> 19:26.487
Don't pull that out, Colleen.

19:26.555 --> 19:28.589
And if I don't do something,

19:28.657 --> 19:30.391
you will never make a decision.

19:30.458 --> 19:34.762
You'll just froufrou
around with Nancy and Avery

19:34.830 --> 19:36.530
until they're both gone.

19:36.598 --> 19:38.065
And then where will I be?

19:38.133 --> 19:41.502
I'll be circling the globe
in my coffin rocket.

19:41.570 --> 19:43.604
Something I saw on tv.

19:43.672 --> 19:44.738
It's very expensive.

19:44.806 --> 19:47.775
I'm done disapproving, Jackie.

19:47.843 --> 19:50.110
I'm just trying to help.

19:50.178 --> 19:53.147
I need to know that someone

19:53.215 --> 19:55.616
is looking out for my little boy.

19:55.684 --> 19:57.685
All right, Colleen.

19:57.752 --> 20:01.155
Then I'm asking you,
for the first time in my life,

20:01.223 --> 20:03.691
tell me what to do.

20:03.758 --> 20:05.726
And I'm going to tell you,

20:05.794 --> 20:09.597
for the first time in my life,

20:09.664 --> 20:12.066
I can't!

20:14.202 --> 20:15.870
I--I did not lose her, sir.

20:15.937 --> 20:18.405
Carl would never let you down.

20:18.473 --> 20:19.974
Carl, that does not sound right.

20:20.041 --> 20:22.476
Kevin--no.

20:22.544 --> 20:25.446
Who am I?

20:25.513 --> 20:27.147
Is it Keith?

20:27.215 --> 20:28.549
No, that's not-- yes, I'm Keith.

20:32.787 --> 20:35.422
That's our show.
