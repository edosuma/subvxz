Yeah, well, that's

- Yes, hi. I'm--
- Alec Lightwood.

01:35.170 --> 01:37.170
Head of the New York Institute.
I expect we'll be seeing

01:37.170 --> 01:39.790
quite a bit of each other at
your Downworld Cabinet meetings.

01:40.790 --> 01:42.290
No hard feelings.
Right, Bane?

01:42.290 --> 01:44.040
On the contrary,

01:44.040 --> 01:45.830
I'm very content
in my new position.

01:45.830 --> 01:48.330
Being the High Warlock
is a thankless job.

01:48.330 --> 01:50.380
Long hours, little pay...

01:50.380 --> 01:51.670
but I'm sure that doesn't
matter to someone

01:51.670 --> 01:53.420
as young and civic-minded
as yourself.

01:53.420 --> 01:56.540
Oh, don't be so jaded.
I may only be 484,

01:56.540 --> 01:58.000
but I'm no stranger
to service.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.080
All those years working
for the High Warlock in Madrid

02:01.080 --> 02:02.540
have prepared me well...

02:02.540 --> 02:05.790

as easy on you as he was.

02:05.790 --> 02:07.960
After all, I'm here

02:07.960 --> 02:11.710

some glorified shuttle service.

02:11.710 --> 02:13.380
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

07:02.170 --> 07:03.790
Uh... it's a surprise.

07:05.710 --> 07:09.500

07:42.750 --> 07:45.580
Alec and Magnus have been to

have you done with Jace?

07:54.920 --> 07:55.960

talking about?

07:55.960 --> 07:57.000
I've been on
tons of dates.

07:59.960 --> 08:01.920

08:01.920 --> 08:04.380
Yeah. Among others...

you actually care about.

08:08.540 --> 08:09.540

really change

08:11.710 --> 08:12.580

take her for dinner?

08:12.580 --> 08:13.920
You tell me.

08:13.920 --> 08:16.960
See, that's not usually
how dinner recommendations work.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.080
OK, look. I'm not
exactly an expert

08:20.080 --> 08:21.710
on the subject, but...
I don't know,

08:21.710 --> 08:23.420
why don't you get her flowers,

08:23.420 --> 08:25.000
take her to the movies?

08:25.000 --> 08:27.290
Ugh! No. I don't
do movies.

08:27.290 --> 08:28.750
Maybe she does.

08:28.750 --> 08:30.710
Look, Izzy, I want to
take her someplace mundane,

08:30.710 --> 08:32.000
not boring.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.670
She deserves
to have fun.

08:33.670 --> 08:35.620
A night she's
not gonna forget.

08:35.620 --> 08:37.710
What's the most romantic thing
you two have done together?

08:38.710 --> 08:42.170
I did steal a demon motorcycle
from a seedy vampire bar.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.120
Uh...

08:44.120 --> 08:46.540
You know, maybe
a mundane restaurant

08:46.540 --> 08:48.250
isn't such a bad idea after all.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.540
ALEC: Hey, Magnus?

09:02.580 --> 09:03.830
Your magic working OK?

09:03.830 --> 09:05.250
Totally back to normal.

09:06.330 --> 09:07.620
And since I'm
not the High Warlock,

09:07.620 --> 09:09.290
whatever doesn't affect me

09:09.290 --> 09:11.000
is no longer my problem.

09:12.750 --> 09:14.830
Is something wrong
with my shampoo?

09:14.830 --> 09:16.380
Uh, no. It's actually...

09:16.380 --> 09:18.120
way better than what I
have back at the Institute.

09:18.120 --> 09:19.710
Where do you buy it?

09:19.710 --> 09:21.580
I don't buy it, I brew it.

09:21.580 --> 09:23.920
It's a special blend
of Indian sandalwood

09:23.920 --> 09:26.540
that I started mixing
back in the 18th century.

09:27.750 --> 09:28.750
You make this?

09:28.750 --> 09:30.670
Alexander, mixing potions

09:30.670 --> 09:32.210
is the cornerstone
of the warlock arts.

09:32.210 --> 09:33.790
Well, I know, I just...

09:33.790 --> 09:35.580
I mean, if you can

09:35.580 --> 09:37.960
wash your hair magically, why do
you go through the trouble?

09:38.960 --> 09:40.420
Because I enjoy taking showers.

09:41.880 --> 09:42.920
All right, well,
if you're not too busy,

09:42.920 --> 09:45.040
can you, you know,
brew me a bottle?

09:47.380 --> 09:48.380
Hold that thought.

09:53.670 --> 09:54.670
Lorenzo?

09:57.750 --> 09:58.750
What are you doing here?

09:58.750 --> 10:01.290
I didn't want to give you
the chance to avoid me.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.000
Why would I do that?

10:04.000 --> 10:05.290
LORENZO: Because you
thought you could get away

10:05.290 --> 10:07.880
with sabotaging my party.
The ley line under my home

10:07.880 --> 10:09.460
was intentionally corrupted.

10:09.460 --> 10:11.250
I knew you were petty,

10:11.250 --> 10:12.960
I just didn't realize
you'd go this far

10:12.960 --> 10:14.750
- to make me look bad.
- You saw my eyes.

10:14.750 --> 10:16.830
My magic was as useless
as anyone's.

10:16.830 --> 10:18.460
An exposed mark
proves nothing.

10:18.460 --> 10:20.710
You think I
don't recognize

10:20.710 --> 10:22.750
Asmodeus' handiwork
when I see it?

10:24.710 --> 10:26.420
I haven't seen Asmodeus
in centuries.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.000
Yet you do know him...

10:31.920 --> 10:33.880
...far better than anyone else
in this dimension.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.540
I know what he's
capable of.

10:35.540 --> 10:37.790
More importantly, you know
how to use his demonic magic.

10:37.790 --> 10:40.120
If Asmodeus truly
escaped from Edom,

10:40.120 --> 10:42.040
all of New York
is in danger.

10:42.040 --> 10:44.460
Now, as High Warlock,
it's your--

10:44.460 --> 10:46.210
My job...

10:46.210 --> 10:48.420
is to keep my people safe, Bane.

10:48.420 --> 10:51.040
And if I have to banish
problematic warlocks

10:51.040 --> 10:52.880
to the lower reaches
of the Spiral Labyrinth

10:52.880 --> 10:54.880
for their crimes, then so be it.

10:55.830 --> 10:57.580
I know you're behind this.

10:57.580 --> 11:00.380
And it's only a matter of time
until I prove it.

11:04.420 --> 11:06.500
♪♪♪

11:12.290 --> 11:13.920
Why would Lorenzo
accuse you

11:13.920 --> 11:15.380
of working with
a greater demon?

11:15.380 --> 11:17.540
Especially one
like Asmodeus?

11:20.040 --> 11:22.120
Asmodeus and I have a history...

11:23.710 --> 11:24.920
He's one of the few demons

11:24.920 --> 11:26.830
capable of doing
something like this.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.960
Yeah, but we've fought
greater demons before,

11:29.960 --> 11:31.670
but I've never seen anything
like what happened

11:31.670 --> 11:32.670
at that party.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.540
It has to do
with the ley lines.

11:35.540 --> 11:37.790
Couldn't that mean
the Seelie Queen is involved?

11:37.790 --> 11:39.920
What do demons have
to do with ley lines?

11:41.500 --> 11:44.830
Healthy ley lines are
the energy source for all magic,

11:44.830 --> 11:46.380
Seelie and warlock alike,

11:46.380 --> 11:47.710
but they can become corrupted.

11:50.880 --> 11:52.920
Asmodeus isn't just
a greater demon.

11:52.920 --> 11:55.210
He's the most powerful
prince of Hell.

11:55.210 --> 11:56.620
And if Lorenzo's right,

11:56.620 --> 11:58.500
what happened at the party
is just the beginning.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.880
And...

11:59.880 --> 12:01.790
And you knew him personally?

12:11.580 --> 12:13.170
Asmodeus is my father.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.620
Look, I'm sorry
I never told you.

12:24.790 --> 12:25.960
I was ashamed.

12:29.620 --> 12:32.120
I knew every warlock
had a demon parent,

12:32.120 --> 12:34.830
it's just... Asmodeus?

12:39.080 --> 12:40.580
Well, we have
to stop him.

12:43.960 --> 12:45.710
First we need to track him down.

12:47.620 --> 12:50.460
And my father...

12:50.460 --> 12:51.960
his magic is unique.

12:54.250 --> 12:56.170
But if I can study
the corrupted ley lines,

12:56.170 --> 12:57.880
we might be able to find him.

12:57.880 --> 12:59.170
What are we waiting for?

12:59.170 --> 13:01.920
We need to get
into Lorenzo's mansion,

13:01.920 --> 13:04.500
and I'm afraid we'll never be
able to portal through his wards

13:04.500 --> 13:05.580
without him knowing.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.880
We don't always
have to use magic.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.040
Like taking a shower, right?

13:14.000 --> 13:16.790
Breaking and entering isn't
exactly like taking a shower.

13:18.670 --> 13:20.210
Who said anything
about breaking in?

13:26.670 --> 13:28.620
Focus!
OK, OK.

13:29.960 --> 13:31.290
"Heterotroph"?

13:31.290 --> 13:32.750
Oh, come on.
That one's easy.

13:32.750 --> 13:35.330
"Any animal incapable
of making its own food."

13:35.330 --> 13:37.290
Yes! Sounds like someone I know.

13:38.290 --> 13:39.920
I don't need
to make my own food,

13:39.920 --> 13:42.000
not when I'm one card away
from you buying my dinner.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.170
See, you have it backwards.
You're one wrong answer away

13:44.170 --> 13:45.960
from buying me dinner. So...

13:46.920 --> 13:49.540
OK. You don't
even eat food.

13:49.540 --> 13:50.790
Not yet, but...

13:51.790 --> 13:53.080
...I'm working on it.

14:04.830 --> 14:06.080
It's a very slow process.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.330
Give me a second.

14:07.330 --> 14:09.000
Sorry, were you
gonna eat this?

14:13.500 --> 14:14.920
What is your problem?

14:14.920 --> 14:16.290
Are you kidding me?

14:16.290 --> 14:18.290
It's bad enough when the vampire
was just sleeping here,

14:18.290 --> 14:19.920
but now you're
shacking up with him?

14:19.920 --> 14:22.620
Oh, yeah. We can all smell it
on you. It's disgusting.

14:23.620 --> 14:25.250
My sex life

14:25.250 --> 14:27.120
is none of your business.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.620
Then take it out
of the Jade Wolf.

14:28.620 --> 14:30.040
Some of us
are trying to eat.

14:30.040 --> 14:31.380
Simon and I

14:31.380 --> 14:33.000
aren't going anywhere.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.960
And just because Luke let you
back into the pack,

14:35.960 --> 14:38.120
doesn't mean I won't
kick your ass.

14:38.120 --> 14:39.500
Don't ever

14:39.500 --> 14:40.580
speak to me

14:40.580 --> 14:42.080
like that again.

14:47.170 --> 14:48.170

14:53.290 --> 14:55.250

14:55.250 --> 14:57.080
Don't worry about that.
Do you know any or not?

14:57.080 --> 14:58.750
Um...

15:17.750 --> 15:19.120
She's fine. She got
a little banged up,

15:19.120 --> 15:20.120
but she'll
be all right.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.120
Oh, good.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.040
Is there a special occasion
I don't know about?

15:24.040 --> 15:26.000
Not really. I'm...

15:26.000 --> 15:27.790
grabbing dinner with Jace.

15:27.790 --> 15:29.250
Dinner?

15:31.420 --> 15:33.420
What are you
doing here anyway?

15:34.420 --> 15:37.210
Uh... I'm just running this case
by whoever's on duty.

15:37.210 --> 15:38.120
I could help!

15:38.120 --> 15:39.670
Jace'll understand.

15:39.670 --> 15:41.120
No, no, no. I got
it covered. You go.

15:41.120 --> 15:42.460
Have fun.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.290
I pulled some surveillance
footage off the NYPD server

15:53.290 --> 15:54.830
of our nurse
who got possessed.

15:54.830 --> 15:56.120
Tim Dempsey.

15:58.250 --> 16:00.210
I got a feeling his possession
isn't just a one-off.

16:01.420 --> 16:03.250
Three homicides in 48 hours,

16:03.250 --> 16:05.460
all suspects good,
decent folk

16:05.460 --> 16:07.330
suddenly becoming unhinged
and killing their loved ones.

16:07.330 --> 16:09.460
I'll search the footage
for the exact moment

16:09.460 --> 16:10.880
of Tim's possession.

16:10.880 --> 16:13.380
It might take all night,
but it's worth a shot.

16:13.380 --> 16:15.080
All right, take out
on me.

16:21.250 --> 16:23.210
Señor Lightwood.
I suppose you're here

16:23.210 --> 16:24.830
to defend Magnus Bane?

16:24.830 --> 16:27.170
No. Actually, I'm here
to defend you.

16:28.330 --> 16:30.920
And as the head of the Institute
it's my job to keep you safe.

16:30.920 --> 16:33.170
What if I can prove
that Magnus is involved?

16:33.170 --> 16:35.040
Seems like you have
a conflict of interest, no?

16:35.040 --> 16:36.420
My interest is
in stopping the person

16:36.420 --> 16:37.670
who corrupted
your ley lines.

16:40.120 --> 16:41.330
You have my word.

16:41.330 --> 16:44.000
Not a very loyal boyfriend,
are you?

16:44.000 --> 16:46.210
I believe in justice, Mr. Rey.

16:46.210 --> 16:47.500
Now if you don't mind,

16:47.500 --> 16:49.960
I would like to come in and
take an official statement.

16:51.790 --> 16:52.790
But of course.

16:58.420 --> 17:00.750
You really believe that Magnus
did this out of spite?

17:00.750 --> 17:03.290
Magnus Bane is the only
warlock I know

17:03.290 --> 17:05.960
capable of conjuring
that type of demonic magic.

17:05.960 --> 17:07.210
Well, I assure you...

17:07.210 --> 17:08.210
if Magnus is behind this,

17:08.210 --> 17:10.120
I will turn him over
to the Clave myself.

17:11.120 --> 17:12.290
Spoken like
a true Shadowhunter.

17:12.290 --> 17:14.620
The law is hard,
but it is the law.

17:14.620 --> 17:16.250
Yes, well...

17:17.210 --> 17:18.420
...how about a toast?

17:18.420 --> 17:19.670
To our new partnership?

17:19.670 --> 17:21.540
An excellent idea.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.420
Scotch

17:23.420 --> 17:24.620
I'll have whatever
you're having.

17:24.620 --> 17:26.330
An old fashioned then...

17:26.330 --> 17:28.330
and I do mean old-fashioned.

17:30.210 --> 17:32.880
I've been drinking this recipe
for over 200 years.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.710
You're absolutely
going to love it.

17:34.710 --> 17:36.540
I could conjure it,

17:36.540 --> 17:38.960
but I find mixing by hand

17:38.960 --> 17:41.170
to be the only way to achieve...

17:42.380 --> 17:43.420
...perfection.

17:49.040 --> 17:50.540
These ceilings
are spectacular.

17:50.540 --> 17:51.830
LORENZO: Thank you.

17:51.830 --> 17:52.920
Cheers.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.880
To our... our new...
partnership.

17:56.880 --> 17:58.170
Cheers.

18:01.250 --> 18:03.170
Perfection. Truly.

18:03.170 --> 18:04.710
Oh, I'm glad
you like it.

18:04.710 --> 18:06.250

18:14.210 --> 18:16.170
Wow. This place
is amazing!

18:17.380 --> 18:18.710

hear about it?

18:18.710 --> 18:20.670
Oh, you know. I hear things.

What's the name
of the reservation?

18:24.120 --> 18:26.000
The what

18:26.000 --> 18:27.290
Do we need one?

18:27.290 --> 18:29.250
I could squeeze you both
in at a communal table.

18:29.250 --> 18:30.790
If you're OK with that?

18:32.420 --> 18:34.330
Um...

18:34.330 --> 18:35.710
I don't know.
What do you think?

18:35.710 --> 18:36.620
I mean, we can go
somewhere else--

18:36.620 --> 18:39.000
No. No, this is perfect.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.120
OK.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.420
Mm-hmm.
I seem to remember

that you have an amazing...

19:06.830 --> 19:09.080
antique pot upstairs?

19:09.080 --> 19:11.040
It's a 16th century Ming Vase.

19:11.040 --> 19:13.290
I procured it from a Castilian
trader when it was still new.

19:13.290 --> 19:14.420
Incredible craftsmanship.

19:14.420 --> 19:16.290
You have an interest
in ceramics?

19:16.290 --> 19:17.380
I dabble.

19:17.380 --> 19:18.540
Huh!

19:18.540 --> 19:21.580
Would it be too forward of me
to ask for a tour?

19:21.580 --> 19:22.880
Not in the least!

19:22.880 --> 19:24.920
I must show you
my Faberge egg.

19:24.920 --> 19:26.960
It was a gift
from the Tsar himself

19:26.960 --> 19:28.880
in the spring of 1887.

19:28.880 --> 19:30.420
Or was it 1888?

19:30.420 --> 19:32.420
Oh, I know!
It was late 19th century.

19:32.420 --> 19:35.670
Anyway, I was at
the Romanov Easter party

19:35.670 --> 19:37.420
and Nicholas comes up to me...

19:37.420 --> 19:41.710
Nicholas! I can barely remember
the colour of his eyes.

19:46.380 --> 19:47.420
OK...

19:47.420 --> 19:48.540
So why are you
the only one here?

19:48.540 --> 19:49.880
IZZY: I took on
a little extra work

19:49.880 --> 19:51.380
so that everybody
could go out tonight.

19:51.380 --> 19:52.880
Well, just make sure you
don't burn yourself out.

19:53.920 --> 19:55.040
You deserve a life too.

19:55.040 --> 19:57.120
Yeah, well, my life is
not important right now.

20:00.620 --> 20:02.580
You know, for a while,
I felt guilty

20:02.580 --> 20:04.120
about my role with the Circle.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.580
So I thought that joining
the NYPD would make up for it.

20:07.580 --> 20:08.880
Did it?

20:08.880 --> 20:11.080
For the most part...

20:12.080 --> 20:14.000
...but I stopped spending
as much time with Jocelyn.

20:16.380 --> 20:17.880
And that's time
I can't get back.

20:19.460 --> 20:22.670
I get it, but I
don't have a Jocelyn.

20:22.670 --> 20:24.750
Maybe that's because
you're not looking.

20:26.670 --> 20:28.420
If you don't
make time for yourself,

20:28.420 --> 20:30.000
you're not gonna find them.

20:34.420 --> 20:36.460
So, you called Simon
for dating advice?

20:36.460 --> 20:38.830
No, I called Simon
for restaurant advice.

20:38.830 --> 20:40.540
Had he called me for dating
advice, I would have advised

20:40.540 --> 20:42.460
against this situation.

20:42.460 --> 20:44.330
OK, not a problem.

20:44.330 --> 20:47.250
You guys just...
do your own thing.

20:47.250 --> 20:49.380
Ignore us. There's no reason
this has to be weird.

20:49.380 --> 20:51.120
Yeah. Right.

with oysters, right?

Wrong. Crab legs?

crab.

I'm OK as long as there's no...

21:18.670 --> 21:20.880
shells or claws involved.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.120
Got it. Um...

21:22.120 --> 21:23.540
OK, then. The flatbread?

Burrata
salad.
Burrata salad?

21:25.330 --> 21:27.040
Let's do a burrata salad.

21:40.170 --> 21:42.000
CLARY: Coming from a bartender,
that says a lot.

21:43.210 --> 21:45.420
Oh, ketchup on fish?
That's disgusting.

isn't banishment.

character building.

36:30.330 --> 36:33.460
Lorenzo Rey could use
a bit of character building.

36:33.460 --> 36:34.960
Mm-hmm.

lines is still out there.

you for being Asmodeus' son,

36:48.420 --> 36:51.330

demon who's responsible.

you go get some sleep?

this footage for you.

I need help with.
