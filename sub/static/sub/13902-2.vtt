00:29.286 --> 00:32.436
Behind closed doors,
in warmly lit rooms all over London,

00:32.526 --> 00:35.245
pleasure is taking place.

00:35.326 --> 00:37.635
Some spontaneous, some planned,

00:37.726 --> 00:39.682
and yes, some paid for.

00:39.766 --> 00:42.041
And tonight's...

00:42.126 --> 00:45.323
tonight's is strictly invitation only.

00:49.806 --> 00:54.561
Sometimes, I get paid to do
the things I"ve always wanted to do.

01:40.126 --> 01:43.562
I love it when my personal desires
are the same as my professional duties.

01:43.646 --> 01:47.002
The most prestigious adult party in the country.

01:49.566 --> 01:53.081
These parties are for genuine couples only,
and entry is competitive -

01:53.166 --> 01:55.805
you have to be under 40, educated,

01:55.886 --> 01:57.877
and beautiful.

01:57.966 --> 02:00.082
Welcome, welcome.

02:00.166 --> 02:04.364
Now, you"ll need to check in your phones,
any recording equipment or cameras

02:04.446 --> 02:06.198
to be returned at the end of the night.

02:06.286 --> 02:09.084
There is a number you can be reached on
for emergency

02:09.166 --> 02:11.441
that was sent along with your invitations.

02:12.486 --> 02:14.363
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

02:15.846 --> 02:18.121
- Are we married?
- No, I don"t think so.

02:18.206 --> 02:20.242
Do you remember what I do for a living?

02:20.326 --> 02:22.203
Aleksandar Yerkovic,

02:22.286 --> 02:26.165
top designer of energy-saving devices
and renewable energy technology,

02:26.246 --> 02:29.124
you"re currently working on
a new European hybrid car engine.

02:29.206 --> 02:32.084
- Part of the engine. Which part?
- Never been that interested in your work.

02:32.166 --> 02:34.202
And that has always been hurtful to me.

02:34.286 --> 02:36.720
Which is why we are not married.

02:36.806 --> 02:40.321
- Oh, but what do you do for a living?
- In this dress, no one"ll care.

02:43.926 --> 02:46.394
Just for show. I don"t drink when I"m working.

02:48.926 --> 02:51.998
Adult parties are like any other party.

02:52.086 --> 02:54.077
There"s someone who wants to be
the centre of attention.

02:54.166 --> 02:56.202
I love your... feathers.

02:56.286 --> 02:58.083
Thank you.

02:58.166 --> 03:01.363
Then there"s the shy people
who find themselves in the corner.

03:02.286 --> 03:05.642
The cool crowd who know everyone
and the organisers.

03:10.126 --> 03:12.481
And the room where the real party happens.

03:16.286 --> 03:17.958
Wow.

03:18.806 --> 03:20.603
This is all a bit of a turn-on.

03:21.366 --> 03:23.926
It"s quiet in here.

03:24.006 --> 03:25.962
It"s early yet.

03:34.126 --> 03:36.321
I didn"t think there was
much point wearing knickers.

03:36.406 --> 03:38.795
It... It"s too early.

03:40.326 --> 03:42.760
- OK.
- I... I want to wait.

03:42.846 --> 03:45.155
What I want is to watch you.

03:45.246 --> 03:48.556
Watch all the other men want you.

03:48.646 --> 03:51.080
And then maybe later on at home,

03:51.166 --> 03:54.476
when you are really desperate,

03:54.566 --> 03:56.557
then I will fuck you.

03:59.486 --> 04:01.920
OK.

04:08.326 --> 04:09.998
- Oh! Shit, sorry.
- Oh, shit!

04:10.086 --> 04:11.883
- I"m so sorry. That was my fault.
- Sorry, no...

04:11.966 --> 04:14.002
- Are you OK? I"m sorry.
- Yeah, I"m fine.

04:14.086 --> 04:17.317
I"m afraid I don"t... Could you...?
Do you have something, er...?

04:17.406 --> 04:21.000
- Yeah. Are you sure you"re OK?
- Yeah, yeah. I"m fine, thank you.

04:22.326 --> 04:24.635
- Oh, shit. I"m so sorry.
- Oh.

04:24.726 --> 04:27.763
- It"s quite...
- Do you know where the ladies" are?

04:27.846 --> 04:30.041
- Downstairs.
- OK, thank you. Sorry.

04:30.126 --> 04:32.003
No, it"s all right.

04:34.286 --> 04:36.242
I know that man from somewhere.

04:37.806 --> 04:41.276
I tend to panic if I see someone I recognise.
Could be very awkward.

04:41.366 --> 04:45.154
Have to go through my mental Rolodex
of everyone I"ve ever slept with.

04:51.366 --> 04:53.004
This could take a while.

04:59.326 --> 05:00.884
That"s it.

05:01.766 --> 05:03.916
It"s Jay Lorre, the writer.

05:04.006 --> 05:05.962
His first novel changed my life.

05:06.046 --> 05:08.082
That man, he can write women.

05:09.966 --> 05:14.039
But of course you should never meet
your heroes. Everyone knows that.

05:16.126 --> 05:18.879
- Have you see An Inconvenient Truth?
- No.

05:18.966 --> 05:22.754
Oh, it"s fabulous.
I mean, terrifying, but really good.

05:22.846 --> 05:26.043
I feel so guilty.
I take so many short-haul flights.

05:26.126 --> 05:28.276
- So cheap, though.
- I just wanted to say...

05:28.366 --> 05:30.721
sorry about the spillage situation.

05:30.806 --> 05:32.762
That"s quite all right.

05:32.846 --> 05:34.802
Sorry, I... we were...

05:34.886 --> 05:37.002
pouring wine on each other earlier.

05:37.086 --> 05:38.565
- Oh.
- Really?

05:38.646 --> 05:40.602
No, not in a...

05:40.686 --> 05:43.325
I just mean me being clumsy.

05:43.406 --> 05:45.681
- No, no, I bumped into her.
- Yeah.

05:46.606 --> 05:48.562
So where do you fly to?

05:48.646 --> 05:51.558
Oh, well, we"ve just got back from Portugal.

05:51.646 --> 05:54.206
We"re actually trying to set up a...

05:54.286 --> 05:56.846
Have you been chucking the rest
over other people?

05:56.886 --> 05:58.877
- No.
- Good.

05:58.966 --> 06:00.524
I"d get jealous.

06:02.566 --> 06:04.602
This your sort of thing, then, is it?

06:04.686 --> 06:07.246
- Sorry, I don"t know your name.
- It"s Belle.

06:07.286 --> 06:10.995
- And, yeah, I suppose it is my sort of thing.
- Belle? I like that.

06:11.086 --> 06:14.166
That"s very... American South, isn"t it?

06:14.201 --> 06:15.963
Close. Surrey-Hampshire border.

06:16.046 --> 06:17.399
Right.

06:17.486 --> 06:20.523
I had to be smuggled over
the Surrey-Hampshire border once.

06:20.606 --> 06:22.756
It was a terrible business. Anyway, cheers.

06:22.846 --> 06:24.359
Cheers.

06:26.966 --> 06:28.558
So, what do you do, Jay?

06:29.726 --> 06:32.286
- Oh, well, this and that.
- How"s that going?

06:32.366 --> 06:34.038
Swings and roundabouts.

06:34.126 --> 06:36.435
Don"t give everything away, it"s embarrassing.

06:39.206 --> 06:40.719
You know what I do.

06:42.686 --> 06:44.642
You knew my name before I told you.

06:47.406 --> 06:49.966
- I"ve seen your books.
- You"ve seen my books?

06:50.006 --> 06:52.440
Well, don"t read them, whatever you do.

06:53.886 --> 06:57.561
I don"t suppose you"d like
to go somewhere more private?

07:00.446 --> 07:03.006
She is very beautiful, isn"t she?

07:03.086 --> 07:05.646
Yeah. Absolutely.

07:05.726 --> 07:09.514
Aleksandar, we might go for a wander,
if you"d like to come.

07:10.446 --> 07:12.437
I don"t think so.

07:12.526 --> 07:16.235
No, I will give you
one of my famous massages.

07:32.926 --> 07:35.486
- He likes you.
- You think?

07:35.526 --> 07:38.120
Mm, but he can"t have you.

07:39.486 --> 07:41.238
- No?
- No...

07:41.326 --> 07:44.398
because only I can have you.

07:47.766 --> 07:49.245
Perfect.

08:04.099 --> 08:06.852
The night wears on, the clothes come off,

08:06.939 --> 08:10.898
guests everywhere get down
to what the evening"s all about, except me.

08:10.979 --> 08:13.891
A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
to seduce Jay Lorre,

08:13.979 --> 08:16.857
and here I am with the only possessive man
at an orgy.

08:18.779 --> 08:20.212
Thanks.

08:25.899 --> 08:27.332
- Sylvia.
- Yes, darling?

08:27.419 --> 08:29.535
Were you talking earlier
about the environment?

08:29.619 --> 08:30.893
Sorry?

08:30.979 --> 08:35.177
Did you know Aleksandar is advising the
government on renewable energy strategies?

08:35.259 --> 08:37.090
- What, you mean solar and everything?
- Mm.

08:37.179 --> 08:40.888
Yes, we"re principally working on
a new hybrid car.

08:40.979 --> 08:44.130
Oh, a hybrid car, you mean like
those ones everyone has in LA.

08:44.219 --> 08:49.691
I certainly hope so. America is the greatest
polluter and they contribute least to our...

08:54.569 --> 08:55.684
Hello.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.361
Hi.

08:57.449 --> 08:59.405
You having a good time?

08:59.489 --> 09:01.445
Can hardly catch my breath. And you?

09:01.529 --> 09:05.886
Yeah. Must be one of the only people
who hasn"t been in the playroom.

09:06.809 --> 09:08.561
Oh, yeah?

09:08.649 --> 09:11.243
Aleksandar would rather I didn"t.

09:12.089 --> 09:15.320
Right. Well, this would be the place to come
to be possessive.

09:15.409 --> 09:17.286
Tell me about it.

09:20.569 --> 09:22.525
I like your work, by the way.

09:23.849 --> 09:26.682
Well, thank you very much.
I like your work too.

09:28.409 --> 09:31.367
It"s just a shame
you"re not doing anything tonight.

09:31.449 --> 09:34.088
Why, are you doing anything tonight?

09:35.169 --> 09:36.761
Well, apparently not.

09:44.409 --> 09:47.845
The show"s starting.
Time for the show, everyone.

10:19.209 --> 10:20.403
Shall we?

11:58.969 --> 12:01.324
- Hello.
- Hello.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.645
- OK?
- Yeah.

12:28.129 --> 12:31.644
- What"s up?
- You"re not into being watched, are you?

12:31.729 --> 12:33.765
No, it"s not that, it"s just...

12:34.809 --> 12:37.854
- I"m not into being caught.
- Your boyfriend?

12:37.889 --> 12:40.767
- We wouldn"t want to come between you two.
- No, I"d love you to.

12:40.849 --> 12:42.680
Just not now.

12:44.689 --> 12:46.645
You could always come home with us.

12:48.569 --> 12:50.924
- Really?
- Really.

12:58.689 --> 13:01.806
Now I realise it"s very unprofessional
to ditch a client,

13:01.889 --> 13:06.360
and that you should never let your personal
desires get in the way at work, but...

13:10.769 --> 13:13.044
- Hi.
- Madam.

13:13.129 --> 13:15.723
All these men want you.

13:16.929 --> 13:20.001
I am going to take you home...

13:20.089 --> 13:23.365
and I am going to really show you
what you get

13:23.449 --> 13:25.838
for making all these men want you,

13:25.929 --> 13:28.045
you naughty girl.

13:29.529 --> 13:31.485
Excuse me. Belle Sinclair?

13:31.569 --> 13:32.763
Yes.

13:32.849 --> 13:35.807
Miss Sinclair, there"s a call for you
on our emergency line.

13:38.249 --> 13:40.205
I"ll be one minute.

13:43.609 --> 13:45.839
- This is what you do for a living?
- No, no.

13:45.929 --> 13:49.558
I"m in a fringe production
of A Doll"s House next month, so...

13:49.649 --> 13:51.605
That"s good. You can pack all this in, then.

13:51.689 --> 13:53.247
Well, we"ll see.

13:53.329 --> 13:55.524
How"s this for a sad face?

13:57.089 --> 13:59.762
- Oh, that is good.
- This?

13:59.849 --> 14:01.407
- Too much.
- Too much?

14:01.489 --> 14:03.639
- Yeah, too much.
- You"re a love. Thank you.

14:04.649 --> 14:08.324
There"s one excuse we all know
that will get you out of anything at work.

14:10.529 --> 14:14.283
- Personal reasons?
- Yeah, personal reasons.

14:16.369 --> 14:18.485
Obviously you"ll be fully reimbursed.

14:18.569 --> 14:20.446
- Pardon?
- Obviously you can have all your money back.

14:20.529 --> 14:22.645
But that is not the point.

14:22.729 --> 14:25.448
- Yeah, I know, absolutely.
- It is unsatisfactory.

14:25.529 --> 14:28.441
Yeah, I know, but... what are you gonna do?

14:28.529 --> 14:30.281
Personal reasons?

14:30.369 --> 14:32.963
Yeah. Personal reasons.

14:54.609 --> 14:57.407
You've seven new messages.

14:57.489 --> 14:58.763
Hannah, did you get
your mum's message?

14:58.849 --> 15:00.999
- Just a minute.
- Give me a call when you pick this up.

15:01.089 --> 15:03.842
- Hello, it's your mum again...
- Oh, this is a nightmare.

15:03.929 --> 15:06.807
- Oh, I don"t believe this.
- What"s the matter?

15:06.889 --> 15:08.447
Is something wrong?

15:08.529 --> 15:11.566
I"m not sure I can come back.
I"ve got all these messages about this thing.

15:11.649 --> 15:13.799
Can"t it wait until tomorrow?

15:14.809 --> 15:16.447
Maybe.

15:16.529 --> 15:19.407
- No, I should go.
- Oh, no. Why?

15:19.489 --> 15:21.445
Personal reasons.

15:21.529 --> 15:23.087
Bye.

15:24.929 --> 15:26.681
Bye.

15:38.009 --> 15:42.241
Only my sister would wait till I was this close
to having the best sex ever to have a baby.

15:42.329 --> 15:44.081
The selfish bitch.

15:44.169 --> 15:47.684
- This bloke, Ben...
- What?

15:47.769 --> 15:51.478
Nothing, it was just quite a works do,
you"d have loved it.

15:53.449 --> 15:56.168
Can"t believe my parents called you
before they called me.

15:56.249 --> 15:59.321
They called me looking for you.
And they do like me a bit more.

15:59.409 --> 16:01.365
That"s true.

16:01.449 --> 16:03.007
Oh, you bought a card?

16:03.089 --> 16:06.047
- Vanessa"s got a desk full of bloody cards.
- Course she does. Let me sign it.

16:06.129 --> 16:08.723
It"s sealed. Get your own.

16:08.809 --> 16:10.686
I need a wife.

16:10.769 --> 16:12.805
- Hello!
- Hey.

16:12.889 --> 16:15.449
- Hello.
- Look at you, Hannah. Blimey.

16:15.529 --> 16:17.485
- Here she is.
- Hello, stranger.

16:17.569 --> 16:19.480
- Hello.
- Wow.

16:19.569 --> 16:22.208
- I was at a works do.
- Well, I was only having a baby.

16:24.049 --> 16:26.609
- Oh, yeah. Well done, you guys.
- Thanks.

16:26.649 --> 16:28.128
- What is it?
- It"s a boy.

16:28.209 --> 16:31.121
- Oh, my God.
- We"ve always known it was a boy.

16:35.049 --> 16:39.327
- Awww. Thanks, Ben.
- That"s all right.

16:39.409 --> 16:41.320
Do you wanna hold him?

16:41.409 --> 16:43.365
Maybe you should sit down first.

16:44.369 --> 16:46.360
Sit down, go on.

16:50.089 --> 16:51.602
There you go, sweetheart.

16:54.809 --> 16:56.765
- You all right?
- Yeah.

17:05.809 --> 17:08.117
Hello. Hello.

17:11.729 --> 17:13.765
Can I have a go?

17:21.249 --> 17:23.204
Won"t be long till it"s you, mate.

17:23.289 --> 17:25.165
Shut up.

17:27.249 --> 17:28.682
Where"s Dad?

17:28.769 --> 17:31.442
Killing himself with tobacco, probably.

17:37.129 --> 17:40.883
Look how tiny his hands are
compared to Ben"s.

17:40.969 --> 17:44.279
I"m your uncle Ben.
We"re gonna go clubbing together.

17:52.489 --> 17:54.605
- Hello, youngest.
- All right, Dad?

17:57.289 --> 18:00.201
- What do you think of your nephew, then?
- He"s all right.

18:00.289 --> 18:02.405
- You?
- Yeah, he"ll do.

18:06.129 --> 18:08.085
There you go, Grandad.

18:16.289 --> 18:18.120
So, what you been up to, then?

19:35.809 --> 19:37.288
Hannah.

19:38.209 --> 19:39.528
Hannah.

19:40.489 --> 19:42.366
Fuck.

19:42.449 --> 19:44.405
I think I"ve found the real me.

19:46.569 --> 19:50.118
- Where did you get that from?
- I saw it in your handbag in the hospital.

19:52.249 --> 19:54.205
Now, is it just me...

19:54.289 --> 19:56.723
or are you a little bit overdressed
for a work do?

19:56.809 --> 19:59.369
Or underdressed. Whatever.

19:59.409 --> 20:02.162
Yeah, well, you know me,
I never play by the rules.

20:13.569 --> 20:15.241
Laters.

20:16.129 --> 20:17.801
Laters.

21:03.329 --> 21:08.357
Maybe my personal life and my professional
life aren't that easily reconciled.

21:08.449 --> 21:10.405
But that's true of all of us, surely.

21:11.609 --> 21:14.885
At least I get to go to bed
with my favourite author.

21:14.969 --> 21:16.925
Just not in the way I'd have liked.

21:34.409 --> 21:36.525
- You look lovely.
- You look pretty good yourself.

21:36.609 --> 21:37.246
Shall we?

21:37.329 --> 21:40.048
1500 good reasons to do the night shift.

21:40.129 --> 21:43.804
From this moment on, I'm on the client's time,
his treat for the night.

21:43.889 --> 21:47.564
Do I know you? I"m looking for a bit of fun,
and I think you are too.

21:47.649 --> 21:50.959
- You"re moonlighting. You"re a bad girl.
- I know.

21:51.049 --> 21:54.883
I know what you office tarts do -
play with the hole-punch, photocopy your arse.

21:56.409 --> 21:58.969
You"re very directive. I like that.

21:59.049 --> 22:01.643
I wanna watch you come.

22:02.049 --> 22:10.643
