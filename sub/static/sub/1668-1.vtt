00:56.390 --> 00:58.893
The Oracle's words stand as a warning.

00:59.602 --> 01:00.603
A prophecy.

01:02.521 --> 01:04.315
Sparta will fall.

01:04.815 --> 01:07.359
All of Greece will fall.

01:14.366 --> 01:17.995
And Persian fire will
reduce Athens to cinder.

01:18.746 --> 01:21.290
For Athens is a pile of stone and wood...

01:21.540 --> 01:23.209
and cloth and dust...

01:23.751 --> 01:27.421
and, as dust, will vanish into the wind.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.299
Only the Athenians themselves exist.

01:30.549 --> 01:33.552
And the fate of the world hangs
on their every syllable.

01:40.476 --> 01:41.602
Only the Athenians exist.

01:43.687 --> 01:46.148
And only stout wooden ships can save them.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.568
Wooden ships...

01:50.152 --> 01:52.446
and a tidal wave of heroes' blood.

02:02.039 --> 02:04.708
Leonidas, my husband...

02:05.417 --> 02:06.961
Leonidas, your king...

02:08.628 --> 02:12.299
Leonidas and the brave 300 are dead.

02:13.592 --> 02:15.219
The free men and women of Greece...

02:15.469 --> 02:18.222
are not bound by
a beautiful Spartan death.

02:18.597 --> 02:20.599
War is not their love.

02:20.850 --> 02:23.185
Yet he lay down his life for them.

02:23.435 --> 02:25.396
For the promise Greece holds.

02:28.149 --> 02:32.153
'Tis our enemies who forged our freedom
in the fires of war.

02:33.279 --> 02:36.365
It was King Darius
who came to take our land.

02:37.449 --> 02:40.744
Ten years ago,
when youth still burned in our eyes...

02:41.078 --> 02:44.790
before this bitter war forced
our children to become men.

02:46.417 --> 02:50.337
Ten years ago, this war began...

02:50.588 --> 02:52.590
as all wars begin:

02:53.382 --> 02:55.217
With a grievance.

02:58.220 --> 02:59.722
Marathon.

03:01.140 --> 03:02.975
The Persian king, Darius...

03:03.475 --> 03:05.895
annoyed by the notion
of Greek freedom...

03:06.729 --> 03:09.064
has come to Greece to bring us to heel.

03:11.609 --> 03:13.694
He makes landfall at the
field of Marathon...

03:13.944 --> 03:16.363
with an invading force
which outnumbers...

03:16.614 --> 03:18.574
the Greek defenders three-to-one.

03:18.824 --> 03:21.952
And so at dawn, the hopeless Athenians
do the unthinkable.

03:22.745 --> 03:24.246
They attack.

03:24.496 --> 03:26.874
They attack the weary Persians
as they disembark...

03:27.124 --> 03:30.586
their ships
on shaky legs after a month at sea.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.048
They attack before they can
establish their war camp...

03:34.298 --> 03:35.758
and supply their soldiers.

03:36.759 --> 03:37.760
And who...

03:38.010 --> 03:40.387
is the architect of this mad strategy?

03:41.013 --> 03:42.053
A little-known Athenian...

03:42.223 --> 03:43.724
soldier.

03:44.642 --> 03:46.227
His men call him...

03:46.477 --> 03:48.270
Themistokles.

03:48.520 --> 03:52.107
He gives the Persians a taste
of Athenian shock combat.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.168
All thoughts of glory are gone.

06:17.753 --> 06:18.753
Thousands dead.

06:19.421 --> 06:20.964
Hundreds of them their own.

06:23.884 --> 06:27.304
A free Greece...

06:27.554 --> 06:30.474
<i>an Athenian experiment
called "democracy. "</i>

06:34.103 --> 06:35.396
Could this idea be worth it?

06:36.605 --> 06:39.316
Worth all this sacrifice?

06:41.402 --> 06:43.737
Themistokles would let
the good King Darius decide.

06:47.032 --> 06:48.659
For through the chaos...

06:48.909 --> 06:50.452
a moment appeared.

06:53.997 --> 06:55.666
And Themistokles would seize it.

07:06.885 --> 07:07.928
A moment...

07:08.178 --> 07:09.972
that would ring across the centuries.

07:10.222 --> 07:11.223
A moment that would...

07:11.473 --> 07:13.225
raise him from simple soldier...

07:13.475 --> 07:15.644
to the height of
Athenian political power.

07:15.894 --> 07:18.439
No!

07:20.858 --> 07:24.278
A moment that would make
Themistokles a legend.

07:43.046 --> 07:44.673
Yet even as the praise and glory...

07:44.923 --> 07:46.758
were heaped upon him...

07:47.009 --> 07:49.928
Themistokles knew in his heart
he had made a mistake.

07:51.180 --> 07:53.807
It was Darius' son, Xerxes...

07:54.057 --> 07:56.477
whose eyes had the stink
of destiny about them.

07:58.562 --> 08:01.064
Themistokles knew
he should have killed that boy.

08:02.941 --> 08:06.028
That glorious mistake
would forever haunt him.

08:12.326 --> 08:14.036
And so it was Themistokles himself...

08:14.286 --> 08:17.372
who sent a ripple
across the Persian empire...

08:17.623 --> 08:19.333
and set into motion...

08:19.583 --> 08:22.294
forces that would bring fire
to the heart of Greece.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.924
For as the good king lay dying...

08:27.174 --> 08:28.634
all his greatest generals...

08:28.884 --> 08:31.887
and advisors
were summoned to his bedside.

08:32.221 --> 08:33.388
None greater...

08:33.639 --> 08:37.351
than his finest
naval commander, Artemisia.

08:37.768 --> 08:40.437
Her ferocity bested only by her beauty.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.941
Her beauty matched only
by her devotion to her king.

08:50.072 --> 08:52.324
Darius favored Arfemisia
among his generals...

08:52.574 --> 08:55.494
for she had brought him victory
on the battlefield.

08:56.119 --> 08:57.287
In her...

08:57.538 --> 09:00.457
he had the perfect warrior protegee...

09:00.707 --> 09:02.626
that his son, Xerxes, would never be.

09:06.838 --> 09:10.217
So sweet, my child.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.011
My sweet...

09:13.762 --> 09:15.389
child.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.274
Father.

09:25.983 --> 09:27.526
Xerxes.

09:28.026 --> 09:31.405
Do not repeat your father's mistake.

09:32.739 --> 09:36.410
Leave the ignoble Greeks to their ways.

09:37.536 --> 09:40.664
Only the gods can defeat them.

09:41.582 --> 09:44.668
Only the gods.

09:56.722 --> 09:58.765
For seven days, Xerxes mourned...

09:59.016 --> 10:01.101
paralyzed by grief.

10:01.351 --> 10:04.688
On the eighth day, Artemisia
whispered the seed of madness...

10:04.938 --> 10:06.690
that would consume him.

10:06.940 --> 10:10.694
Your father's words were not a warning...

10:11.486 --> 10:13.113
but a challenge.

10:14.615 --> 10:17.534
Only the gods can defeat the Greeks?

10:20.120 --> 10:24.124
You will be a god-king.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.756
Artemisia gathered the priests, wizards...

10:31.006 --> 10:34.092
and mystics
from every corner of the empire.

10:34.509 --> 10:35.636
They wrapped”

10:35.886 --> 10:39.264
the young king in Cimmerian gauze
dipped in ancient potions...

10:39.681 --> 10:42.059
and set him to wander the desert...

10:43.268 --> 10:46.521
till in a delirium of heat and thirst,
he stumbled upon...

10:46.772 --> 10:48.148
<i>a hermit's cave.</i>

10:52.110 --> 10:54.655
Xerxes passed the vacant eyes...

10:54.905 --> 10:56.323
and empty souls...

10:56.573 --> 11:00.577
of the hollow creatures that dwell
in the dark corners of all men's hearts.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.290
And in that darkness...

11:06.625 --> 11:08.460
he surrendered himself completely...

11:08.710 --> 11:11.755
to power so evil and perverse...

11:15.384 --> 11:17.094
that, as he emerged...

11:17.344 --> 11:20.681
no part of a human man
that was Xerxes survived.

11:29.314 --> 11:32.526
His eyes blazed like scarlet coals.

11:34.403 --> 11:38.323
He was stripped, cleansed, glabrous...

11:38.573 --> 11:40.075
and smooth.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.245
Xerxes was reborn...

11:43.495 --> 11:44.955
a god.

11:50.293 --> 11:52.462
Artemisia trusted no one.

11:53.171 --> 11:55.048
So in the cover of night...

11:55.298 --> 11:59.052
the palace was cleansed
of all Xerxes' allies.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.099
All those he trusted...

12:08.770 --> 12:11.022
all those who had raised him...

12:15.819 --> 12:18.155
all those he had
once looked to for counsel...

12:19.990 --> 12:22.743
were quickly introduced to her wrath.

12:48.477 --> 12:49.978
And as the god-king stood...

12:50.228 --> 12:51.897
before his people...

12:53.064 --> 12:55.901
Anemisia watched her flawless
manipulation take shape.

12:56.151 --> 12:58.904
- For glory's sake...
- For glory's sake...

12:59.154 --> 13:01.740
- ...for vengeance's sake...
- ...for vengeance's sake...

13:03.992 --> 13:05.285
war.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.287
War!

13:10.081 --> 13:12.626
War is coming to Greece...

13:12.876 --> 13:16.379
in the visage of a monster army
over a million strong.

13:17.255 --> 13:20.467
It should be little more than a formality
for Themistokles...

13:20.717 --> 13:22.385
the hero of Marathon...

13:22.636 --> 13:24.596
to finish what he began.

13:25.889 --> 13:29.434
Please! We must appeal to Xerxes' reason!

13:29.684 --> 13:30.727
Coward!

13:30.977 --> 13:33.230
Athens is a city of cowards!

13:33.480 --> 13:34.022
Shut your cock hole!

13:34.272 --> 13:35.357
Shut your own!

13:35.607 --> 13:37.567
I'll kill you! Fuck the Spartans!

13:37.818 --> 13:39.444
Fuck those muscle-bound boy-lovers!

13:39.694 --> 13:40.403
Silence!

13:40.654 --> 13:42.197
Silence for the hero of Marathon!

13:42.447 --> 13:44.950
This is a democracy, not a street fight.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.993
Quiet! It's Themistokles.

13:47.244 --> 13:50.831
The Persian attack will come
from both the north and the south.

13:51.081 --> 13:53.667
The city-states should negotiate a truce.

13:53.917 --> 13:56.294
Yes, yes, we must negotiate.

13:57.295 --> 13:58.880
Negotiate with tyranny?

14:00.090 --> 14:02.968
Give me one example of when
that has ever profited a nation.

14:03.218 --> 14:06.054
- You're right. We must unite.
- My fellow countrymen...

14:06.763 --> 14:09.432
we can only judge the future...

14:09.683 --> 14:12.352
from what we have suffered in the past.

14:13.728 --> 14:16.356
Now, many of you here
stood with me at Marathon.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.526
And for those of you who served...

14:19.776 --> 14:21.903
and faced the cut
and thrust of battle...

14:22.153 --> 14:24.698
you know how true peace is forged.

14:25.615 --> 14:27.325
Do not be deceived.

14:27.576 --> 14:29.619
Xerxes, the son of Darius...

14:29.870 --> 14:31.955
is a wolf at our door.

14:32.747 --> 14:34.916
Right here, right now...

14:35.792 --> 14:37.502
we must choose:

14:37.919 --> 14:40.589
Do we stand and fight for Greece or not?

14:41.756 --> 14:42.924
Argos...

14:43.174 --> 14:44.342
Corinth...

14:44.593 --> 14:45.760
Megara...

14:46.011 --> 14:47.637
Athens.

14:47.888 --> 14:50.348
Not even Sparta
can match the Persians alone.

14:50.599 --> 14:52.809
We must persevere as one nation.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.312
Or we will perish clinging onto...

14:55.562 --> 14:57.230
our own self-interests.

14:58.356 --> 15:01.693
Send us the ships that we need
to defend Greece.

15:01.943 --> 15:04.362
Themistokles will need more
than our cities' ships.

15:04.613 --> 15:06.531
He will need our children
to join the fight.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.035
And what of Sparta?

15:10.285 --> 15:13.121
You send every ship that we have...

15:13.371 --> 15:15.707
to the northern coast of Euboea.

15:16.958 --> 15:20.837
I will go and seek the help
of the great Spartans.

15:42.484 --> 15:43.485
Still no word...

15:43.735 --> 15:46.196
from the messenger
you sent to Sparta.

15:46.863 --> 15:49.991
King Leonidas may have been insulted
by your generous offer.

15:50.241 --> 15:54.204
Perhaps I need to march into Sparta myself
and burn it to the ground.

15:56.164 --> 15:57.666
Remember...

15:57.916 --> 15:59.626
when a king is loved as I am...

16:01.086 --> 16:03.338
much can be accomplished.

16:04.881 --> 16:08.218
They would be fools
to resist my divine power.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.262
Athens is attempting to
assemble a coalition.

16:11.513 --> 16:13.974
It'll be nothing more
than a patchwork of ships.

16:16.184 --> 16:19.980
Once these waters have been traversed,
I will lead my force across the land.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.565
I will remind the cowards of Greece...

16:22.816 --> 16:26.236
that we have not
forgotten their insolence.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.956
Rest and water the horses.

16:38.206 --> 16:39.624
It's best I go alone.

16:39.874 --> 16:43.294
Spartans don't get along well with others.

17:34.763 --> 17:36.556
- Spartans.
- Themistokles.

17:37.932 --> 17:39.392
You old snake.

17:39.642 --> 17:42.479
- What brings you this far south?
- I've come to see Leonidas.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.648
- To warn him that the Persians are on the march.
- You're too late.

17:45.899 --> 17:49.069
Persian messenger already presented
his terms to Leonidas.

17:49.819 --> 17:52.197
Symbolic offering of earth and water.

18:00.830 --> 18:02.207
Spartans!

18:02.457 --> 18:03.538
Know this and know it well.

18:05.001 --> 18:07.587
That any Spartan's finest moment...

18:08.338 --> 18:09.756
the greatest fulfillment...

18:10.006 --> 18:11.841
of all he holds dear...

18:12.092 --> 18:13.384
is that moment...

18:13.635 --> 18:15.762
when he has fought his heart out...

18:16.012 --> 18:18.848
for the preservation of Sparta...

18:19.099 --> 18:22.435
and lies dead on the battlefield...

18:22.685 --> 18:24.395
victorious.

18:26.189 --> 18:27.440
Now...

18:27.941 --> 18:29.984
who is willing to die
at our king's side?

18:30.235 --> 18:31.361
Ah-ooh!

18:31.611 --> 18:33.863
Ah-ooh! Ah-ooh!

18:34.489 --> 18:36.074
Themistokles.

18:38.034 --> 18:41.955
You've come a long way to stroke your cock
whilst watching real men train.

18:42.205 --> 18:43.248
Queen Gorgo.

18:44.415 --> 18:47.377
Shouldn't he be training them
to live at their king's side?

18:48.962 --> 18:50.255
A new age is dawning, Gorgo.

18:52.257 --> 18:56.094
Won't be long before men rise up
and shed the yoke of mysticism and tyranny.

18:56.344 --> 18:58.805
- That sounds like a threat.
- No.

18:59.222 --> 19:02.892
An opportunity to join the rest of free
Greece and stand against a true tyrant.

19:04.519 --> 19:08.148
Unless, of course, you and Leonidas
have already made a deal with Xerxes.

19:08.398 --> 19:10.150
No terms were reached.

19:10.733 --> 19:12.610
Xerxes' messenger was...

19:12.861 --> 19:15.321
Well, he was rude and he lacked respect.

19:15.572 --> 19:19.576
He didn't understand the same threats made
in Thebes and Athens would not work here.

19:20.326 --> 19:23.663
This is the birthplace
of the world's greatest warriors.

19:24.956 --> 19:28.751
Men whose king would stand
and fight and die for any one of them.

19:29.794 --> 19:31.004
Xerxes' messenger...

19:31.254 --> 19:34.465
did not understand
this is no typical Greek city-state.

19:37.552 --> 19:39.387
This is Sparta.

19:40.763 --> 19:43.641
It was clear to the messenger
there'd be no Spartan submission?

19:43.892 --> 19:44.934
It was clear.

19:45.185 --> 19:48.479
Even now Leonidas is in counsel
with the Oracle over his battle plan.

19:48.730 --> 19:51.399
The Festival of the Carneia
is all that stands in our way.

19:51.649 --> 19:54.360
Surely the Oracle will see we must fight.

19:54.611 --> 19:56.196
Well, then my timing is perfect.

19:56.988 --> 20:00.158
I am commanding a fleet of ships
that will represent a united Greece.

20:00.408 --> 20:02.660
I need Sparta to join me.

20:03.578 --> 20:04.996
Give me your ships, Gorgo.

20:05.246 --> 20:08.082
I'll make sure that Xerxes wishes
he never crossed the Aegean.

20:08.333 --> 20:11.586
You'll receive no Spartan ships.
We've no interest in a united Greece.

20:11.836 --> 20:14.422
That is your dream, Themistokles, not ours.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.175
All I am concerned with
is the preservation...

20:17.425 --> 20:18.551
of Sparta.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.638
My guards will see you out.

20:24.015 --> 20:25.642
It's funny that you mock freedom...

20:25.892 --> 20:27.769
here in your selfish isolation.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.855
Yet freedom, in her wisdom...

20:31.105 --> 20:33.399
has chosen you to defend her.

20:36.444 --> 20:37.654
MY queen.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.409
Will Sparta join our fight?

20:44.744 --> 20:47.497
Apparently the Persians have offered
the Spartans something they cannot refuse.

20:47.747 --> 20:48.747
And what is that?

20:50.250 --> 20:51.918
A beautiful death.

21:10.228 --> 21:13.523
They say you are the bravest
of our captives.

21:14.107 --> 21:17.610
They say you are a whore
from the eastern seas.

21:21.030 --> 21:23.616
You're not the smartest.

21:26.035 --> 21:28.037
Your commander is a Greek.

21:28.288 --> 21:30.248
Just like me.

21:31.541 --> 21:34.794
You Persian men take your orders
from a Greek woman.

21:35.044 --> 21:38.381
Yes, my brother, I am Greek by birth...

21:38.631 --> 21:41.676
and I have Greek blood
running through my veins.

21:44.387 --> 21:46.139
But my heart...

21:48.641 --> 21:49.851
is Persian.

22:22.383 --> 22:23.801
Within hours...

22:24.510 --> 22:26.888
the Greek fleet will be shattered.

22:27.138 --> 22:29.932
What of our master
and the much-feared Spartans?

22:30.183 --> 22:32.310
There's nothing to fear.

22:32.894 --> 22:36.773
Only King Leonidas
and his personal guard of 300...

22:37.023 --> 22:39.025
have marched to fight.

22:39.275 --> 22:40.396
They'll collapse. Instantly.

22:44.072 --> 22:45.072
You.

22:51.329 --> 22:52.789
Do you agree?

22:55.333 --> 22:56.709
Many will perish.

22:58.127 --> 23:01.255
Your confidence leaves me
with a strong impression.

23:02.757 --> 23:04.926
It's a curious thing for
a simple ship guard...

23:05.176 --> 23:07.929
to not lower his eyes
when questioned by me.

23:09.055 --> 23:11.808
That could've been just
a lack of discipline.

23:13.017 --> 23:15.478
But a man's hands do not lie.

23:15.728 --> 23:16.813
They can reveal...

23:17.063 --> 23:21.067
every imperfection
and flaw in his character.

23:22.026 --> 23:23.986
You see, your hands
are not rough enough...

23:24.237 --> 23:26.280
to work the rigging of this ship.

23:27.824 --> 23:30.576
I know every single man beneath my lash.

23:30.827 --> 23:34.622
Can you explain to me
how I don't know you?

23:36.457 --> 23:38.668
Forgive me, commander.

23:41.379 --> 23:43.381
Let me introduce myself.

23:45.049 --> 23:46.049
Seize the spy.

24:05.236 --> 24:07.029
Coward.

24:08.197 --> 24:09.949
Storm is upon us.

24:12.785 --> 24:15.663
It's just some mad Greek weather.

24:28.217 --> 24:30.470
- Themistokles.
- Come.

24:34.015 --> 24:35.308
Calisto.

24:35.558 --> 24:38.144
What is spoken here must not be repeated.

24:38.603 --> 24:39.812
Anywhere.

24:42.732 --> 24:45.943
My son has not earned the right
to sit at the table of combat veterans.

24:46.194 --> 24:48.571
- But you can trust him.
- Very well.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.325
- Tell me.
- A Greek woman...

24:52.575 --> 24:54.869
commands all of Xerxes' ships
to the south.

24:56.287 --> 24:57.914
Artemisia.

24:58.915 --> 24:59.916
I know of her.

25:00.958 --> 25:03.878
Artemisia is murderous by trade
with true skill on the sea...

25:04.128 --> 25:05.922
and she has thirst for vengeance.

25:06.547 --> 25:08.049
Rumors are her entire family...

25:08.299 --> 25:10.593
was murdered
by a squad of Greek hoplites.

25:11.677 --> 25:14.138
I have heard all the stories.

25:15.223 --> 25:17.850
And the hoplites spared no one on that day.

25:44.335 --> 25:46.379
The story goes
that they raped and murdered...

25:46.629 --> 25:48.089
her entire family.

25:50.132 --> 25:53.052
And then they turned their attention
towards her.

26:15.908 --> 26:19.412
After years of being kept in the bowels
of a Greek slave ship...

26:20.580 --> 26:23.124
she was discarded and left for dead...

26:24.083 --> 26:26.669
where she was found near death
by a Persian emissary.

26:47.898 --> 26:50.484
Artemisia vowed that day
to return to Greece...

26:51.944 --> 26:53.654
<i>only when she could watch it burn.</i>

27:05.249 --> 27:08.836
She was fed, clothed, trained by the
finest warriors of the Persian empire...

27:12.923 --> 27:14.383
<i>until no match could be found...</i>

27:14.634 --> 27:16.314
<i>for her skills and gift with the sword.</i>

27:44.080 --> 27:46.582
The great King Darius was impressed
by her commitment.

27:47.875 --> 27:50.086
And she quickly rose to command
at his side.

27:53.839 --> 27:55.466
She has sold her soul...

27:55.716 --> 27:57.176
to Death himself.

27:58.511 --> 28:00.846
Well, some could say
that I've sold mine to Greece.

28:05.101 --> 28:06.102
And what do you think?

28:06.352 --> 28:08.062
- Me?
- Yes.

28:08.312 --> 28:10.189
You are the future of this country.

28:11.232 --> 28:12.608
I'm ready to fight.

28:16.112 --> 28:18.572
I like him. He reminds me of you.

28:19.258 --> 28:20.258
We will need...

28:20.282 --> 28:21.282
every last man.

28:21.325 --> 28:22.410
He is still just a boy.

28:22.660 --> 28:23.994
Much younger...

28:24.245 --> 28:26.038
- ...have defended our country.
- Enough!

28:26.497 --> 28:29.250
You are a dreamer
and will speak of this no more.

28:33.087 --> 28:35.089
Themistokles, I've set your plan in motion.

28:35.339 --> 28:38.259
And my land force
will be assembled by the second day.

28:38.509 --> 28:41.345
You will be needed.
I can assure you of that.

28:45.141 --> 28:47.059
And there is bad news.

28:47.309 --> 28:50.271
Leonidas has marched north
to the Hot Gates.

28:52.064 --> 28:54.024
Bad news? With the Spartans...

28:54.275 --> 28:58.112
- ...at the Hot Gates, our victory is assured.
- If the army were with him.

28:59.113 --> 29:01.031
But between the Oracle and the Carneia...

29:01.282 --> 29:03.909
Leonidas has marched to Thermopylae
with just 300 men.

29:05.077 --> 29:08.539
So the only thing standing
between Athens...

29:08.789 --> 29:10.291
and total annihilation...

29:11.333 --> 29:13.919
is Leonidas and 300 Spartans.

29:18.758 --> 29:20.843
I will search out the veterans among them.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.846
- Establish some order among the volunteers.
- Good.

29:24.555 --> 29:27.683
There's little time
to teach these farmhands strategy.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.311
Just keep them well fed...

29:31.270 --> 29:32.646
and sober.

29:33.314 --> 29:34.732
Anything else?

29:35.274 --> 29:37.193
Wouldn't hurt if they could
swing a sword.

29:40.112 --> 29:41.822
Well, I'll be damned.

29:43.282 --> 29:44.283
Shit.

29:44.533 --> 29:47.453
- Does your father know that you're here?
- No, sir.

29:47.703 --> 29:49.747
And this shield and sword?

29:49.997 --> 29:51.499
My grandfather's.

29:51.749 --> 29:54.543
My mother entrusted them to me
this morning.

29:55.044 --> 29:58.339
- When she gave you her blessing?
- Yes, sir.

29:58.964 --> 30:01.217
With a sharp blade, no less.

30:03.010 --> 30:05.846
Your father is preparing a surprise
for our enemy tomorrow.

30:06.096 --> 30:09.433
I choose to fight here. Now.

30:11.519 --> 30:13.270
Come aboard my ship.

30:13.896 --> 30:15.272
That is where you will fight.

30:15.523 --> 30:16.774
Yes, sir.

30:21.070 --> 30:22.321
We've just over 50 ships.

30:22.571 --> 30:25.324
Persian forces reported a number
in the thousands.

30:25.574 --> 30:28.911
- Those ships appear hardly seaworthy.
- Nothing like the monster ships...

30:29.161 --> 30:32.456
- ...of the Persian fleet.
- We have the advantage. Speed, maneuverability.

30:32.748 --> 30:36.460
The rest of the city-states have sent
anywhere from a handful to a single ship.

30:36.710 --> 30:40.005
- Of course, Athens supplied the balance.
- We have report...

30:40.256 --> 30:44.260
a small advance force of Persian ships have
taken refuge from the storm across the strait.

30:44.552 --> 30:46.846
If the weather breaks,
we could hit them at dawn.

30:48.722 --> 30:49.765
An early Greek victory.

30:50.015 --> 30:51.809
The gods have given us an opportunity...

30:52.059 --> 30:54.019
to wound the Persians,
strengthen Greek morale.

30:56.188 --> 30:57.314
A tempting distraction.

30:57.565 --> 30:59.650
But we'll stick to the battle plan.

30:59.900 --> 31:03.028
Today at sundown, we will sail out
to meet the main Persian fleet.

31:03.279 --> 31:06.323
We'll attack in the open water
with no shore to narrow the battle.

31:06.574 --> 31:08.409
To attack a force of over 1000 ships...

31:08.659 --> 31:10.452
with our meager force is suicide.

31:11.996 --> 31:13.956
Such is my plan.

31:18.127 --> 31:20.713
Look at their excuse for a navy.

31:21.589 --> 31:23.966
Their ships are of little threat.

31:24.842 --> 31:27.094
I need a second in command, Artaphernes.

31:27.344 --> 31:31.348
And whoever proves their excellence
will earn a place beside me.

31:32.766 --> 31:35.603
General Bandari has offered
to lead the first attack.

31:35.853 --> 31:37.062
Bandafi.

31:39.857 --> 31:40.941
Commander.

31:41.191 --> 31:43.110
If I let you lead our first offensive...

31:43.360 --> 31:46.405
what guarantee do I have
that you'll bring me a quick victory?

31:46.655 --> 31:48.574
My word and my life.

31:49.158 --> 31:50.159
Good.

31:50.701 --> 31:52.244
My rules of engagement?

31:52.870 --> 31:56.540
Humiliate the Greeks
and lay waste to their tiny ships.

31:57.541 --> 31:59.960
They'll be dead to the last man.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.222
My brothers.

32:12.723 --> 32:14.725
Steady your hearts.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.228
Look deep into your souls.

32:22.483 --> 32:25.569
For your mettle is to be tested this day.

32:29.406 --> 32:31.659
If in the heat of battle...

32:33.035 --> 32:35.704
you need a reason to fight on...

32:36.830 --> 32:39.541
an idea for which you will give up...

32:40.167 --> 32:42.419
all that you will ever have...

32:43.629 --> 32:46.590
you need only to look at the man
who fights at your side.

32:48.550 --> 32:51.053
This is the "why" of battle.

32:51.303 --> 32:54.098
This is the brotherhood of men-at-arms.

32:55.140 --> 32:56.600
An unbreakable bond...

32:56.850 --> 32:59.853
made stronger by the crucible of combat.

33:01.313 --> 33:05.067
You will never be closer than with those
who you shed your blood with.

33:07.027 --> 33:09.113
For there is no nobler cause...

33:09.363 --> 33:12.700
than to fight for those
who will la y down their life for you.

33:14.702 --> 33:17.121
So you fight strong today.

33:18.247 --> 33:20.332
You fight for your brothers.

33:21.625 --> 33:23.669
Fight for your families.

33:24.461 --> 33:26.463
Most of all, you fight for Greece!

33:26.714 --> 33:27.714
Greece!

33:28.799 --> 33:29.800
Yeah!

33:32.011 --> 33:35.305
And there is only one thing to make sure of
when the fighting starts.

33:35.556 --> 33:36.598
What's that?

33:37.683 --> 33:39.435
Don't get killed on the first day.

33:41.020 --> 33:43.230
That goes for the rest of you.

34:14.928 --> 34:15.928
Persian ships...

34:15.929 --> 34:17.431
are strong at the front.

34:17.681 --> 34:18.681
But they are weak...

34:18.931 --> 34:20.350
in the middle.

34:20.601 --> 34:22.436
We attack them there.

34:32.696 --> 34:34.364
NOW!

34:55.385 --> 34:56.469
Attack!

35:24.665 --> 35:26.041
Ram them!

35:36.969 --> 35:40.055
Archers, now! Now!

35:49.314 --> 35:50.774
Reverse!

35:51.108 --> 35:52.526
NOW!

35:59.324 --> 36:00.701
Go through them!

36:55.589 --> 36:56.840
The enemy's tactics...

36:57.090 --> 36:58.467
are creative.

36:58.717 --> 37:01.136
The defensive circle
leaves no front to assault.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.096
We are losing.

37:03.347 --> 37:05.015
No, you are losing.

37:11.480 --> 37:12.856
Pull back.

37:13.357 --> 37:15.025
Let them have this day.

37:15.651 --> 37:18.695
I'm bored with your failures, Bandari.

37:23.867 --> 37:25.911
I'll not let this wound slow me.

37:26.161 --> 37:28.413
Heh. Somehow I believe you.

37:28.664 --> 37:30.874
My blade will be sharp and ready
by the morning.

37:31.875 --> 37:34.544
Good. Tomorrow you will fight
alongside your father.

37:36.630 --> 37:37.631
Not bad...

37:37.881 --> 37:41.343
- ...for a bunch of farmers.
- And poets and sculptors.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.053
Who'd have known untrained men...

37:43.303 --> 37:46.098
would do so well against
such a considerable adversary?

37:48.475 --> 37:51.728
We're going to need all of our strength
for tomorrow's fight.

37:52.354 --> 37:54.564
How long do you think we can hold them?

37:57.526 --> 37:59.778
If my plan is to work...

38:01.613 --> 38:04.658
long enough for the Spartans
to unite Greece.

38:05.951 --> 38:07.244
Men!

38:07.786 --> 38:09.147
Who will share their wine with me?

38:22.968 --> 38:24.052
Report.

38:24.303 --> 38:26.096
We are still tallying the losses.

38:26.722 --> 38:29.308
But you must understand,
it is extremely difficult...

38:29.558 --> 38:31.893
given the sea and the darkness...

38:32.144 --> 38:33.729
to get an accurate...

38:44.948 --> 38:46.074
Report?

38:46.700 --> 38:48.118
Seventy-five ships lost.

38:48.368 --> 38:49.745
Thirty damaged beyond repair.

38:49.995 --> 38:53.040
Twenty could return with a few weeks' work
in a safe harbor.

38:57.210 --> 39:00.130
The commander of the Greek force
is named Themistokles.

39:00.380 --> 39:02.382
Yes, he is an Athenian general.

39:03.216 --> 39:05.052
He's rumored to have loosed the arrow...

39:05.302 --> 39:07.846
that felled the great
King Darius himself.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.361
No!

39:37.000 --> 39:41.004
This Themistokles has shown himself
to be quite brilliant in battle.

39:42.631 --> 39:44.716
Which is more than I can
say for any of you.

39:46.093 --> 39:49.304
Do you gentlemen find my command
unreasonable?

39:49.763 --> 39:52.307
Is it too much to ask for victory?

39:52.557 --> 39:54.317
Your disappointment in
yesterday's losses...

39:54.559 --> 39:56.144
is warranted.

39:57.604 --> 39:59.606
My disappointment.

40:00.941 --> 40:03.360
My disappointment is not with my losses.

40:03.610 --> 40:07.239
The meager number of damaged ships
and dead slaves means nothing to me.

40:07.489 --> 40:11.284
No, my disappointment...

40:13.829 --> 40:15.539
is in these men.

40:16.832 --> 40:17.833
For though I stand...

40:18.083 --> 40:20.168
among 10,000...

40:20.502 --> 40:21.962
I am alone.

40:24.047 --> 40:27.426
I long for a soul
who would stand by my side.

40:27.676 --> 40:28.844
Who I could trust.

40:34.891 --> 40:37.185
Tell me, General Kashani.

40:37.811 --> 40:39.646
Are you that man?

40:41.523 --> 40:44.776
You will taste your
victory by the day's end.

40:45.235 --> 40:47.571
I will make certain of it.

40:48.822 --> 40:50.615
I hope so.

42:22.207 --> 42:24.376
Advance!

42:31.508 --> 42:35.053
NOW!

42:58.743 --> 43:01.037
Don't lose sight of them.

43:15.385 --> 43:16.511
The Greeks are retreating.

43:16.761 --> 43:19.222
He's got him right where he wants him.

43:19.472 --> 43:21.349
Kashani is a fine tactician.

43:21.975 --> 43:24.644
I was speaking of Themistokles.

43:34.487 --> 43:35.530
Rocks!

43:38.700 --> 43:40.201
Stop, stop!

43:40.452 --> 43:41.745
Stop!

43:42.454 --> 43:44.164
Brace yourselves!

46:30.622 --> 46:31.622
What are you doing here?

46:31.623 --> 46:35.126
A man's responsibility
is to protect his family and his nation.

46:35.376 --> 46:38.338
- Who told you this?
- My father.

47:41.776 --> 47:44.779
You see how Themistokles
employs deception with such grace?

47:45.280 --> 47:48.199
- Why is it so much to ask for victory?
- How can I make amends?

47:48.449 --> 47:49.826
Silence.

47:53.246 --> 47:55.623
You will carry a message for me.

47:56.708 --> 47:58.126
Now they will fear us!

47:58.376 --> 48:02.005
Now they will fear
the Greek men-at-arms! Hup!

48:03.590 --> 48:04.591
He's right.

48:05.341 --> 48:07.218
Fear the Greek fighting man.

48:07.468 --> 48:08.595
Fear his sword.

48:08.845 --> 48:10.179
His shield.

48:10.638 --> 48:13.224
Fear his love for Mother Greece.

48:13.474 --> 48:14.976
But most of all...

48:15.560 --> 48:17.186
fear his freedom!

48:23.276 --> 48:25.194
Don't be angry with the boy.

48:25.486 --> 48:26.779
I took him under my command.

48:27.030 --> 48:30.033
Anger is something I reserve
for my enemies.

48:38.291 --> 48:39.876
Themistokles.

49:00.188 --> 49:03.900
Artemisia's ship is being anchored
in neutral waters.

49:04.150 --> 49:06.319
She'd like to meet with Themistokles.

49:06.569 --> 49:09.447
- How can you guarantee his safe return?
- Well, boy...

49:09.697 --> 49:11.616
the only honor for her now...

49:11.866 --> 49:15.244
will be when she watches
your crushed and broken fleet...

49:15.495 --> 49:17.413
sinking to the bottom of the Aegean...

49:17.664 --> 49:19.248
and is able to recognize you...

49:19.499 --> 49:22.585
nailed to the mast of your ship
with her sword...

49:22.835 --> 49:25.588
as you descend to a watery grave.

49:30.969 --> 49:33.471
Why didn't you just say that to begin with?

50:00.915 --> 50:03.418
Welcome to my humble barge.

50:03.668 --> 50:06.212
We are honored by your presence.

50:08.673 --> 50:10.925
Your barge and you...

50:11.634 --> 50:13.261
are quite impressive.

50:18.057 --> 50:19.892
Kind words.

50:21.519 --> 50:24.731
Now come, Themistokles.
We have much to discuss.

50:26.441 --> 50:29.110
Do you believe the Greeks
are descended from the gods?

50:29.360 --> 50:30.945
I have heard some say that.

50:31.195 --> 50:34.490
And what of you?
Ls there a god in your lineage?

50:34.741 --> 50:38.161
My men say so, and based on
the last two days' battle...

50:38.661 --> 50:41.914
I'd say there's a spark
of the divine in you.

50:43.124 --> 50:45.710
Now who's using kind words?

50:52.592 --> 50:54.177
My men also say that it was you...

50:54.427 --> 50:57.597
who slayed the good King Darius
at Marathon.

50:57.847 --> 51:00.266
Many heroic deeds occurred on that day.

51:00.516 --> 51:02.226
But it was 10 years ago...

51:02.477 --> 51:04.979
and the facts of battle
are often embellished.

51:05.229 --> 51:07.065
This deed, you would remember.

51:08.399 --> 51:11.527
I do what I must to defend Greece.

51:11.778 --> 51:14.322
And I do what I must to defeat her.

51:17.450 --> 51:20.453
For every one Greek killed,
you must kill a thousand Persians.

51:22.455 --> 51:24.123
For every ship I sink...

51:25.083 --> 51:26.876
you must sink a hundred.

51:27.877 --> 51:29.879
I can sustain losses for weeks.

51:30.129 --> 51:32.423
Months, if need be.

51:32.673 --> 51:34.175
My numbers will defeat you...

51:34.425 --> 51:37.136
and I will take your precious boats
with my sword.

51:37.386 --> 51:38.971
I will take your Greek freedom.

51:39.680 --> 51:42.517
Are you asking me
to negotiate a surrender?

51:42.767 --> 51:43.810
No.

51:44.811 --> 51:47.772
I offer you a chance
to avoid such misery and join me.

51:49.357 --> 51:51.901
I'm in need of a commander such as you.

51:52.902 --> 51:54.529
Look at the defense you've mounted.

51:56.572 --> 51:58.032
A handful of triremes.

51:58.866 --> 52:01.077
Leonidas with 300 Spartans.

52:02.870 --> 52:04.080
It's insulting, frankly...

52:04.330 --> 52:07.458
that the mightiest empire the world
has ever seen is met by this.

52:09.627 --> 52:11.796
I don't blame you, Themistokles.

52:12.630 --> 52:15.383
You fought as if the blood
of Poseidon himself...

52:15.633 --> 52:17.760
was coursing through your veins.

52:18.010 --> 52:19.929
No, I blame Greece.

52:20.847 --> 52:23.850
The squabbling bureaucrats
protecting their political hides...

52:24.100 --> 52:26.978
by sending you here to die.

52:30.356 --> 52:32.650
And yet you still fight.

52:34.235 --> 52:36.028
So there must be...

52:37.697 --> 52:38.990
What?

52:40.324 --> 52:44.328
Family back home in Athens
that compels you...

52:45.413 --> 52:48.040
to battle with such passion?

52:50.293 --> 52:52.879
Truth is, I've had no time for family.

52:53.129 --> 52:55.590
I have spent my entire adult life...

52:55.840 --> 52:57.633
with my one true love...

52:58.593 --> 53:00.178
the Greek fleet...

53:00.928 --> 53:02.763
and my one passion...

53:03.014 --> 53:04.891
readying it for you.

53:09.061 --> 53:10.563
Now, that brings me pleasure...

53:10.813 --> 53:14.275
the thought of you pining away for me...

53:15.193 --> 53:17.778
forsaking family and love...

53:18.029 --> 53:21.199
for the promise of a deeper ecstasy.

53:28.247 --> 53:31.667
The ecstasy of steel and flesh...

53:32.835 --> 53:35.796
death and life...

53:37.632 --> 53:39.175
of rage...

53:40.051 --> 53:42.386
and sweat of muscle...

53:43.512 --> 53:45.431
of pure joy...

53:46.432 --> 53:48.601
and deepest sorrow.

53:49.852 --> 53:53.689
Die with me each night and be born again
with me each morning...

53:54.357 --> 53:58.236
as you plant your sword
into the hearts of our enemies.

54:01.989 --> 54:03.658
You fight for freedom.

54:04.200 --> 54:07.954
I offer freedom without
consequence or responsibility.

54:11.207 --> 54:12.667
Join me...

54:14.126 --> 54:15.836
at my side.

54:16.128 --> 54:20.132
Breathe each breath with me
as if it were your last.

56:09.200 --> 56:10.701
Join me.

56:16.749 --> 56:17.958
No.

56:29.095 --> 56:32.348
You're no god. You're just a man.

56:47.488 --> 56:49.740
Be quick with your sword.

56:53.202 --> 56:55.413
You'll not have your death tonight.

56:55.955 --> 56:57.123
Guards!

56:58.749 --> 57:00.918
Remove this filth from my ship.

57:27.194 --> 57:28.194
Well?

57:28.904 --> 57:30.781
What have you learned?

57:38.122 --> 57:40.082
Can Artemisia be beaten?

57:41.792 --> 57:44.086
The next time that we face her...

57:44.336 --> 57:46.964
she's going to bring
all of hell with her.

58:40.893 --> 58:43.312
Hold! Hold!

58:54.865 --> 58:56.951
Send in my personal guard.

59:23.852 --> 59:24.853
Pull back!

59:25.104 --> 59:26.188
Retreat!

59:26.438 --> 59:27.565
- Retreat!
- Retreat!

59:27.815 --> 59:29.316
- Retreat!
- Retreat!

59:30.025 --> 59:31.735
Themistokles!

59:31.986 --> 59:33.487
In the water!

59:37.032 --> 59:39.201
Archers on deck now!

59:39.451 --> 59:41.120
Archers on deck now! Quickly!

59:41.704 --> 59:42.830
Starboard side!

59:43.080 --> 59:44.248
Fire at will!

01:01:00.908 --> 01:01:02.201
Fight on, boy.

01:01:02.451 --> 01:01:03.494
Uh-huh.

01:01:03.744 --> 01:01:05.204
Fight on!

01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:26.725
Aim for the men on top!

01:01:26.975 --> 01:01:28.185
UP there!

01:02:38.714 --> 01:02:41.550
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.761
Abandon ship!

01:04:29.533 --> 01:04:31.869
The dead have no guilt.

01:04:32.411 --> 01:04:34.621
No responsibility.

01:04:35.831 --> 01:04:38.000
Themistokles watches the bodies
of his men...

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:41.086
turn the Aegean red with blood.

01:04:42.129 --> 01:04:43.964
Were they sacrificed for his ego?

01:04:45.674 --> 01:04:49.678
Or to relieve the guilt of the long-ago
mistake at Marathon?

01:04:52.681 --> 01:04:54.391
How many men would have been saved...

01:04:54.641 --> 01:04:57.603
if Themistokles had killed that boy?

01:05:00.355 --> 01:05:03.108
Not even his own soul can be sure.

01:05:04.568 --> 01:05:06.194
My friend.

01:05:07.112 --> 01:05:09.072
We faced the odds.

01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:11.992
Together.

01:05:13.994 --> 01:05:14.995
Listen to me...

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:17.122
Themistokles.

01:05:20.709 --> 01:05:22.878
You will have to fight...

01:05:23.128 --> 01:05:25.923
with twice as much strength
in the morning.

01:05:26.798 --> 01:05:28.800
We will fight shoulder-to-shoulder.

01:05:29.051 --> 01:05:30.427
No, my son.

01:05:31.887 --> 01:05:34.640
You will carry on for both of us.

01:06:33.949 --> 01:06:35.367
What did he say?

01:06:37.911 --> 01:06:40.163
I will tell you in time, boy.

01:06:42.416 --> 01:06:43.750
Quiet now.

01:06:45.085 --> 01:06:47.504
You go and be with your father's spirit.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.433
How many times do you think
we will repeat such a tragedy?

01:07:00.976 --> 01:07:02.144
As many times as we must.

01:07:03.228 --> 01:07:05.063
We are turning young men into memories.

01:07:08.692 --> 01:07:10.610
Do you think I enjoy this?

01:07:12.154 --> 01:07:14.156
Witnessing my friend's final breath?

01:07:18.076 --> 01:07:20.412
Every widow that is made by my decision...

01:07:22.497 --> 01:07:25.208
every child that will grow
without a father...

01:07:27.002 --> 01:07:28.754
they are my choices.

01:07:29.755 --> 01:07:33.383
This is the burden of my command.

01:07:57.282 --> 01:07:58.909
How easy it is to silence...

01:07:59.159 --> 01:08:02.370
the strong and self-disciplined.

01:08:02.621 --> 01:08:05.791
Let my army witness
the great warriors of Sparta.

01:08:09.044 --> 01:08:12.214
March them past these corpses.

01:08:12.464 --> 01:08:15.634
Let them see the cost
of daring to challenge the god-king.

01:08:19.386 --> 01:08:20.930
King Leonidas...

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:25.185
and his brave 300
were the finest Greece has to offer.

01:08:25.477 --> 01:08:26.728
There will be no saviors...

01:08:26.978 --> 01:08:29.397
to rise up and vanquish us.

01:08:30.023 --> 01:08:32.818
Nothing will stop the march of my empire.

01:08:35.362 --> 01:08:36.529
Your Majesty.

01:08:39.366 --> 01:08:41.326
You, take this dead king's sword...

01:08:41.576 --> 01:08:42.868
to Athens.

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:46.038
Let them know
that I am coming next for them.

01:08:47.207 --> 01:08:48.792
Let them know...

01:08:49.042 --> 01:08:50.544
Athens...

01:08:51.252 --> 01:08:54.131
their prize jewel of a city...

01:08:54.923 --> 01:08:57.341
will disappear from the histories.

01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:02.430
Themistokles!

01:09:05.517 --> 01:09:06.518
I bring word...

01:09:06.768 --> 01:09:09.395
from Thermopylae.
Leonidas was betrayed by a hunchback.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.314
The Spartans have been slaughtered.

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:12.774
The Hot Gates have fallen.

01:09:15.777 --> 01:09:17.821
Such a sacrifice.

01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:24.118
Now Greece has her martyrs.

01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:27.538
Daxos, take that message...

01:09:27.788 --> 01:09:29.332
from the Hot Gates...

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:31.917
to every city, every village.

01:09:32.169 --> 01:09:34.754
Let every countryman hear your words.

01:09:35.005 --> 01:09:36.798
But they are dead. All of them.

01:09:37.048 --> 01:09:39.843
Sparta's sacrifice will be what unites us.

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:41.803
Now go.

01:09:42.865 --> 01:09:43.865
Hyah!

01:09:43.889 --> 01:09:46.600
Move all of our ships and men back
to the safety of Salamis.

01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:48.225
And you?

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:51.313
I will take Daxos' message to Athens.

01:09:52.522 --> 01:09:55.775
I was told a hunchback was accountable
for the fall of the Hot Gates.

01:09:57.194 --> 01:10:00.280
That he sold out his country...

01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:03.742
pulled the crimson from his back
and replaced it with Persian gold.

01:10:06.494 --> 01:10:08.288
What is your name, traitor?

01:10:09.372 --> 01:10:12.500
Ephialtes of Trachis.

01:10:24.429 --> 01:10:28.433
I should wet this noble blade
with your blood.

01:10:30.185 --> 01:10:32.020
You would be right to do so.

01:10:32.854 --> 01:10:35.523
There is little beauty about me.

01:10:35.774 --> 01:10:39.778
There is little beauty in what I have done.

01:10:44.616 --> 01:10:46.284
Say what you must.

01:10:46.952 --> 01:10:48.787
I beg of you...

01:10:49.371 --> 01:10:50.872
and all of Athens!

01:10:51.122 --> 01:10:54.668
The god-king will burn this city
to the ground!

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:55.961
What does he mean?

01:10:56.503 --> 01:10:58.171
Quiet yourselves!

01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:03.134
Leonidas' and Sparta's great sacrifice
was no defeat.

01:11:06.263 --> 01:11:08.348
It was a beautiful victory.

01:11:11.643 --> 01:11:14.104
This simple act of valor...

01:11:14.396 --> 01:11:16.856
will allow us to rally each
of our city-states...

01:11:17.107 --> 01:11:19.109
and unite Greece...

01:11:19.985 --> 01:11:21.987
for one purpose...

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:23.488
against one enemy!

01:11:24.906 --> 01:11:25.949
And you.

01:11:26.199 --> 01:11:29.452
You take this message to your god-king.

01:11:29.703 --> 01:11:32.247
That we will take whatever ships
we have left...

01:11:32.789 --> 01:11:35.250
and finish this in the Bay of Salamis.

01:11:36.126 --> 01:11:38.712
But there will be death and destruction.

01:11:38.962 --> 01:11:42.757
Yes, there will be.

01:11:49.514 --> 01:11:50.932
Themistokles.

01:11:53.268 --> 01:11:55.437
I'm here to speak to your queen.

01:11:56.187 --> 01:11:57.689
A warning, Athenian.

01:11:57.939 --> 01:12:00.692
You may not receive a warm welcome.

01:12:27.469 --> 01:12:30.055
May I offer my deepest sympathies.

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:34.517
I cannot change what has happened
to Leonidas...

01:12:34.768 --> 01:12:37.604
but his sacrifice will not be forgotten.

01:12:38.563 --> 01:12:42.025
Do not lecture me on sacrifice,
and be quick with your words, Athenian.

01:12:44.903 --> 01:12:48.156
I request of you the entire Spartan navy.

01:12:48.907 --> 01:12:50.492
Every man, every ship...

01:12:50.742 --> 01:12:53.078
- ...that you can spare.
- Have I not given enough...

01:12:53.328 --> 01:12:54.996
for your dream of a united Greece?

01:12:55.372 --> 01:12:58.750
Shall I put swords in the hands
of my son? Our children?

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.210
Would that please you?

01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:05.173
Have I not given enough
for your ambitions, Themistokles?

01:13:05.423 --> 01:13:06.966
A king.

01:13:07.675 --> 01:13:10.053
Husbands, fathers, brothers.

01:13:10.303 --> 01:13:12.764
Sparta will give no more.

01:13:28.446 --> 01:13:29.989
This belongs with you.

01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:41.709
Avenge him.

01:13:59.686 --> 01:14:02.439
The Oracle's words stood as a warning.

01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:05.108
All of Greece will fall...

01:14:05.733 --> 01:14:09.028
as Persian fire reduces
Athens to cinder.

01:14:10.488 --> 01:14:12.824
For Athens is a pile of stone and wood...

01:14:13.074 --> 01:14:15.660
and cloth and dust...

01:14:16.578 --> 01:14:19.372
and, as dust, will vanish into the wind.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.835
Only the Athenians themselves exist.

01:14:25.044 --> 01:14:28.631
And the fate of the world
hangs on their every syllable.

01:14:29.507 --> 01:14:31.885
Only the Athenians exist.

01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:35.221
And only stout wooden ships can save them.

01:14:35.889 --> 01:14:37.474
Wooden ships...

01:14:38.266 --> 01:14:41.102
and a tidal wave of heroes' blood.

01:14:48.193 --> 01:14:51.279
The Greeks were fools to stand against us.

01:14:51.529 --> 01:14:53.156
Leonidas and his pride...

01:14:53.406 --> 01:14:55.992
were no match for the will of a god.

01:14:58.286 --> 01:15:02.207
Themistokles was a worthless coward.

01:15:02.457 --> 01:15:03.958
And now...

01:15:04.501 --> 01:15:08.213
this pathetic navy
is barely worth our attention.

01:15:08.463 --> 01:15:10.757
If that worthless coward
had stood at my side...

01:15:11.007 --> 01:15:12.592
we would have laid the world...

01:15:12.842 --> 01:15:13.927
at your feet.

01:15:14.844 --> 01:15:15.970
My king.

01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:20.683
Your humble servant brings you news.

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:24.395
The Greek fleet are defenseless...

01:15:24.646 --> 01:15:26.814
within the Bay of Salamis.

01:15:27.482 --> 01:15:29.943
You need only finish them.

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:32.529
Who commands their forces?

01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:38.535
Themistokles of Athens.

01:15:38.785 --> 01:15:40.620
Themistokles is dead.

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:44.332
He is alive. I have seen him myself.

01:15:58.638 --> 01:16:00.431
Ready my troops and armor.

01:16:00.682 --> 01:16:01.975
We will attack at once.

01:16:02.225 --> 01:16:03.226
Wisdom...

01:16:04.936 --> 01:16:05.936
would have us...

01:16:05.937 --> 01:16:08.606
send a probing force to confirm
it is not a trap.

01:16:09.774 --> 01:16:12.026
You would dare to advise me
in matters of war?

01:16:13.653 --> 01:16:15.572
I am the god-king.

01:16:15.822 --> 01:16:18.533
I am the one who triumphed over Leonidas.

01:16:18.783 --> 01:16:20.827
I am the one who laid waste...

01:16:21.077 --> 01:16:22.870
to this showpiece of Athens.

01:16:23.121 --> 01:16:26.291
- I am your king.
- Killing Leonidas and his men...

01:16:26.541 --> 01:16:28.710
only made them martyrs.

01:16:29.586 --> 01:16:31.588
And when you razed Athens...

01:16:32.213 --> 01:16:33.881
you set fire to the only thing...

01:16:34.132 --> 01:16:36.050
of value in this country.

01:16:48.062 --> 01:16:50.481
I will attack the Greeks...

01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:54.235
with my entire navy.

01:16:55.445 --> 01:16:56.571
Artemisia.

01:16:56.821 --> 01:16:58.156
Enough!

01:16:59.657 --> 01:17:03.036
Do not forget who put the crown
on your childish head.

01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:05.246
My king.

01:17:06.331 --> 01:17:07.832
Now sit on your golden throne...

01:17:08.082 --> 01:17:10.752
and watch this battle
from the safety I provide you.

01:17:17.050 --> 01:17:18.718
There in the distance...

01:17:19.927 --> 01:17:22.680
we witness the destruction of Athens.

01:17:26.225 --> 01:17:30.229
Alone, we will face the monster
that cast a shadow across our land.

01:17:33.316 --> 01:17:36.944
I had prayed that the Spartans
would come to lend a hand this morning.

01:17:39.989 --> 01:17:41.908
Perhaps they feel they have given enough.

01:17:42.158 --> 01:17:43.576
You failed us all.

01:17:43.826 --> 01:17:45.203
This is your fault, Themistokles.

01:17:45.453 --> 01:17:47.038
Without Spartans, we're farmhands.

01:17:47.288 --> 01:17:49.848
We should've negotiated
with the Persians when we had the chance.

01:17:54.253 --> 01:17:55.963
You are all right.

01:17:57.799 --> 01:18:01.552
Yes, we are down to a handful of boats.

01:18:02.637 --> 01:18:06.099
And, yes, we are just farmhands.

01:18:06.808 --> 01:18:08.559
We are tradesmen.

01:18:09.686 --> 01:18:10.770
We are boys...

01:18:11.437 --> 01:18:15.149
turned to men through the sacrifice
and forge of combat.

01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:19.946
I played a dangerous game...

01:18:20.196 --> 01:18:21.781
and I lost!

01:18:26.661 --> 01:18:29.997
If you choose to turn your back on me...

01:18:30.456 --> 01:18:31.833
on your country...

01:18:35.128 --> 01:18:37.046
I will not judge you.

01:18:38.715 --> 01:18:40.758
You are free to leave.

01:18:41.843 --> 01:18:43.636
You are still free men.

01:19:07.076 --> 01:19:08.244
Very well.

01:19:10.163 --> 01:19:11.164
Then let us...

01:19:11.414 --> 01:19:15.376
put our shoulders to work and free
those ships from the bosom of Greece.

01:19:17.712 --> 01:19:20.381
Today is a privilege to call our own.

01:19:21.716 --> 01:19:25.303
A story that will be told
for a thousand years.

01:19:26.471 --> 01:19:28.473
Let our final stand...

01:19:28.723 --> 01:19:30.767
be recorded to the histories.

01:19:31.225 --> 01:19:33.019
And let it be shown...

01:19:33.603 --> 01:19:36.189
that we chose to die on our feet...

01:19:36.439 --> 01:19:38.691
rather than live on our knees!

01:20:26.906 --> 01:20:29.283
There is only one thing
you need to know today.

01:20:29.534 --> 01:20:31.035
Not to get killed.

01:20:31.285 --> 01:20:35.289
No. Your father's last words.

01:20:39.377 --> 01:20:42.421
He told me that you had earned
the right to sit at the table.

01:20:59.689 --> 01:21:03.693
Well, my brother,
I have no more tactics or tricks.

01:21:05.486 --> 01:21:07.864
This will be the last battle that we share.

01:21:08.114 --> 01:21:11.742
We have fought next to one other
for as long as I can remember.

01:21:12.577 --> 01:21:15.955
Nothing would please me more
than to rest this sword.

01:21:17.123 --> 01:21:20.710
- The preparations that are required?
- Below deck.

01:21:21.794 --> 01:21:23.713
- Good.
- Are you sure...

01:21:23.963 --> 01:21:25.756
that you want to commit everything?

01:21:26.465 --> 01:21:27.550
Yes.

01:21:29.385 --> 01:21:32.263
Without Artemisia's command,
the Persian navy is nothing.

01:21:34.015 --> 01:21:36.142
We will never be able to reach her.

01:21:36.392 --> 01:21:37.935
I will reach her...

01:21:38.728 --> 01:21:40.646
and put an end to this.

01:21:41.564 --> 01:21:43.983
There will be no room for a retreat.

01:21:45.401 --> 01:21:46.819
I know.

01:21:49.196 --> 01:21:52.617
Today the last Greek
ships will be destroyed.

01:21:52.867 --> 01:21:54.952
Show them no mercy.

01:21:55.202 --> 01:21:57.705
Give them no quarter.

01:21:57.955 --> 01:22:01.167
Today we will dance across the backs
of dead Greeks.

01:22:01.876 --> 01:22:04.629
Today we deliver submission.

01:22:05.504 --> 01:22:07.548
Today I want to feel
Themistokles' throat...

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:09.800
beneath my boots.

01:22:40.623 --> 01:22:43.084
Men, brace yourselves!

01:23:37.221 --> 01:23:38.806
Prepare for close quarters.

01:23:39.056 --> 01:23:40.558
Attack!

01:23:46.689 --> 01:23:47.815
Your father watches you!

01:23:49.191 --> 01:23:51.360
Hold nothing back!

01:23:51.610 --> 01:23:52.945
Seize your glory!

01:24:21.307 --> 01:24:23.851
I'm not here as a witness.

01:25:25.788 --> 01:25:26.788
NOW!

01:25:27.414 --> 01:25:30.042
And let them send our
souls straight to hell!

01:26:07.621 --> 01:26:10.166
Hyah! Come on!

01:27:16.899 --> 01:27:18.442
You offered freedom without...

01:27:18.692 --> 01:27:21.654
- ...consequence or responsibility.
- Are you accepting my offer?

01:27:21.904 --> 01:27:23.364
My answer is still no.

01:27:51.976 --> 01:27:54.353
You fight much harder than you fuck.

01:28:37.896 --> 01:28:40.566
Surrender to me or meet your death.

01:28:40.816 --> 01:28:41.942
Who would you fight...

01:28:42.192 --> 01:28:43.444
if not for me?

01:28:44.069 --> 01:28:46.280
No one could challenge your skill.

01:28:46.530 --> 01:28:49.491
I would rather die a free
man than as a slave.

01:28:50.617 --> 01:28:53.078
Even if the chain was attached to you.

01:29:02.212 --> 01:29:04.673
It begins as a whisper.

01:29:05.466 --> 01:29:07.092
A promise.

01:29:08.135 --> 01:29:09.470
The lightest of breezes...

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:11.000
dances through the rigging...

01:29:11.221 --> 01:29:14.308
as it creaks above the death cries
of 10,000 men.

01:29:15.684 --> 01:29:19.271
It moves through her hair
as gently as a lover's hand.

01:29:19.772 --> 01:29:20.772
That breeze...

01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:25.778
that promise, became a wind,
a wind that is blown across Greece...

01:29:26.028 --> 01:29:28.489
carrying a message
told again and again...

01:29:28.739 --> 01:29:31.700
of our Lady Freedom
and how wise she was...

01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:35.704
to charge Leonidas
to lay all at her feet.

01:29:37.373 --> 01:29:40.250
A wind, my brothers, of sacrifice.

01:29:42.127 --> 01:29:44.046
A wind of freedom.

01:29:46.256 --> 01:29:48.425
A wind of justice.

01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:58.143
A wind of vengeance.

01:30:21.041 --> 01:30:22.793
Ah-ooh! Ah-ooh! Ah-ooh!

01:30:42.604 --> 01:30:43.856
You are being surrounded.

01:30:44.356 --> 01:30:47.276
All of Greece has united against you.

01:30:47.901 --> 01:30:50.821
Delphi, Thebes, Olympia...

01:30:51.071 --> 01:30:53.866
Arcadia and Sparta.

01:31:08.213 --> 01:31:10.757
If death comes for me today, I'm ready.

01:31:12.050 --> 01:31:14.052
I could lower my sword.

01:31:14.303 --> 01:31:16.972
There's still time for you
to ready a launch and escape.

01:31:21.268 --> 01:31:24.855
It would be a poor choice
to force my hand into action.

01:31:25.481 --> 01:31:29.193
Now order your ships to disengage
and surrender to me.

01:31:31.612 --> 01:31:33.280
Surrender?
