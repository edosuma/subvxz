<i>[Betty] Previously on Ugly Betty:</i>

00:03.269 --> 00:05.897
You're under arrest for
the murder of Fey Sommers.

00:05.971 --> 00:09.874
I know who killed Fey Sommers.
It was me.

00:09.943 --> 00:11.433
- Henry!
- Henry!

00:11.511 --> 00:15.743
- Hi.
- Betty, this is my girlfriend, Charlie.

00:16.783 --> 00:22.585
Oh, Ignacio, why can't
all men be like you? Ignacio...

00:22.655 --> 00:27.183
You are going to fire Daniel
and make me editor in chief, right?

00:27.260 --> 00:30.627
- He's my brother, Willie.
- He is the enemy.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.392
I've kind of realized he's not.

00:32.465 --> 00:34.797
- That's The Chin?
- [Betty] Yep.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.393
[Grace] An attorney told me
the case isn't as strong

00:37.470 --> 00:39.734
as they're leading everyone to believe.

00:39.806 --> 00:43.264
- Witnesses saw a blue Aston Martin.
- [Daniel] Blue Aston Martin?

00:53.820 --> 00:55.378
OK, Betty, we're all done.

00:55.455 --> 00:58.447
So now, these new wires
are a different gauge.

00:58.525 --> 01:03.189
So they might feel a little strange
to you and to anyone who's kissing you.

01:03.263 --> 01:05.288
Oh, Dr. Farkas, nobody's kissing me.

01:05.364 --> 01:07.765
Come on.
There must be someone special.

01:07.834 --> 01:11.235
Well, there was a guy,
but he has a girlfriend.

01:11.304 --> 01:12.532
So, uh, how's it feel?

01:12.605 --> 01:16.200
It was tough at first, but now
I'm happy we're all just friends.

01:16.276 --> 01:17.937
No, I meant the braces.

01:18.011 --> 01:20.980
Oh, um, duh... Fine.

01:21.047 --> 01:22.708
You're comfortable with this?

01:22.782 --> 01:26.809
Lt'll probably hurt to chew at first,
but I'll have a milkshake for lunch.

01:26.886 --> 01:29.411
Meant being friends
with the guy and girlfriend.

01:29.489 --> 01:33.220
Oh, the milkshake will help that, too.

01:38.264 --> 01:39.993
[Sighs] That was great.

01:42.302 --> 01:44.634
OK, now you're supposed
to say something.

01:44.704 --> 01:47.070
Oh, yeah, that was good.

01:48.842 --> 01:51.970
Sorry, I'm going through
my morning meetings in my head.

01:52.045 --> 01:54.377
- Wait, you're not gonna make me spoon?
- No.

01:54.447 --> 01:57.939
But you are gonna make me breakfast,
and then I have to get to work.

01:58.017 --> 02:01.509
A woman who likes sex three times
a night and doesn't want to cuddle.

02:01.588 --> 02:03.647
Where have you been all my life?

02:03.723 --> 02:08.955
Well, after you stood me up in college,
I closed my heart off emotionally,

02:09.027 --> 02:11.792
threw myself into work,
substituting it for passion.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.526
Just a rhetorical question.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.628
- I know.
- Never gonna forget that, are you?

02:16.703 --> 02:20.867
I'm not. I might even bring it up
when I talk to your mother.

02:20.940 --> 02:23.932
You're talking to my mother?

02:24.010 --> 02:26.979
Her testimony is important
to your father's defense.

02:27.046 --> 02:29.276
- You can't talk to her.
- Why not?

02:29.349 --> 02:33.376
She's gone. She sort of had a relapse
after my father went to jail.

02:33.453 --> 02:37.219
She kinda just took off.
Could be anywhere.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.384
Technically, this is kidnapping.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.495
You're not blindfolded
in a trunk, Mother.

02:45.565 --> 02:47.760
This is a deluxe suite
in the Grand Regent.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.064
It doesn't even have a park view.

02:50.136 --> 02:53.230
I might as well be tied to a chair
having my ear sliced off.

02:53.306 --> 02:57.333
For your own good. You can't talk to our
lawyer. You drink and say stupid things.

02:57.410 --> 03:01.506
- You mean confess things.
- You're not confessing anything!

03:02.348 --> 03:06.842
Can we at least tell Alexis the truth,
that her father is not a murderer?

03:06.920 --> 03:09.320
It doesn't matter. She hates him.

03:10.723 --> 03:12.350
He's her father.

03:12.425 --> 03:15.519
The only reason she came back
was to put him away.

03:15.595 --> 03:18.792
Alexis and I are finally getting along,
but she'd turn on me

03:18.865 --> 03:21.333
if she found out I hired
Grace Chin to defend him.

03:21.801 --> 03:26.329
- Come on.
- This is some family.

03:32.545 --> 03:38.108
You're not to talk to or call anybody.
Claire Meade has disappeared, OK?

03:38.184 --> 03:40.846
In fact, I gotta change
your name at the front desk.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.410
Brandy Shaloo.

03:43.923 --> 03:45.891
Did you just pull that out of thin air?

03:45.959 --> 03:47.859
It's come in handy.

03:52.265 --> 03:54.028
Betty!

03:54.100 --> 03:55.567
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

03:55.635 --> 03:57.660
Um, how was your weekend?

03:57.737 --> 03:59.466
Oh, it was so nice.

03:59.539 --> 04:03.532
We just stayed in, ordered take-out,
watched a bunch of movies.

04:03.610 --> 04:06.738
Yeah. Vin Diesel can do anything.

04:06.813 --> 04:11.477
Sounds fun. I, um...
got a new shower curtain.

04:14.954 --> 04:16.387
I like your haircut.

04:16.456 --> 04:19.084
First New York haircut!

04:19.158 --> 04:22.286
I didn't take off much,
because Henry likes it long.

04:22.362 --> 04:25.889
So, I don't know
if you're free tonight, but...

04:25.965 --> 04:27.296
Just ask her!

04:27.367 --> 04:29.927
We're throwing a birthday party
for Charlie.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.437
Oh, it's your birthday.

04:32.505 --> 04:34.473
First New York birthday!

04:34.540 --> 04:36.303
Lots of firsts.

04:36.843 --> 04:38.868
Yeah, I know it's really last minute,

04:38.945 --> 04:42.642
but we'd love it if you could make it.
I mean, if you're not busy.

04:42.715 --> 04:44.046
[Charlie] You have to come.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.642
So far it's his dorky friends
from accounting,

04:46.719 --> 04:49.381
and they get drunk
and talk about W-2s.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.753
Well, it is tax season.

04:51.824 --> 04:54.122
Please come. We need our Betty.

04:54.861 --> 04:57.591
I've gotta run. OK, bye.

05:01.501 --> 05:04.629
Listen, you don't have
to come if it's weird.

05:04.704 --> 05:08.435
Weird? No, no.
Why would it be weird?

05:08.508 --> 05:12.672
Lt'll be fun.
I need tax advice anyway.

05:12.745 --> 05:17.614
Good. I'm glad. So...

05:17.717 --> 05:19.184
...bring those receipts!

05:26.993 --> 05:30.485
[Marc] Your boobs
are totally perky today.

05:30.797 --> 05:33.994
- I looking for Amanda Tanen?
- Who wants to know?

05:34.067 --> 05:36.467
- Ooh, a package! I'm Amanda!
- No, no!

05:36.936 --> 05:38.801
I'm from Oswald Lorenzo's studio.

05:38.871 --> 05:41.305
He wanted to give this to you.

05:41.374 --> 05:44.502
You are his new muse. Enjoy.

05:44.577 --> 05:46.135
He's the "it" designer

05:46.212 --> 05:49.340
for those actors who you recognize
but don't know the name.

05:49.415 --> 05:51.679
- Like "What's-her-name?"
- And "that guy."

05:51.751 --> 05:54.015
Wait, how do you know Oswald Lorenzo?

05:54.087 --> 05:57.181
Well, we met at the Jil Sander
party last night.

05:57.256 --> 05:59.315
He was totally worshipping me.

05:59.392 --> 06:02.418
I mean, I get it,
because I was the hottest girl there.

06:02.495 --> 06:05.055
But there was this skank
who was trying to horn in.

06:05.131 --> 06:06.723
And I was as nice as I could be.

06:06.799 --> 06:09.563
Out of the way, skank!

06:11.270 --> 06:14.831
She was a cow. She's one of those
women who just hates other women.

06:14.907 --> 06:17.535
Enough with the vagina monologue!
Open it!

06:23.282 --> 06:24.544
What the hell is that?

06:27.653 --> 06:30.019
"To my muse.

06:30.089 --> 06:34.253
Enjoy 'The Amanda.'
Love, Oswald."

06:37.530 --> 06:40.294
He named a dress "The Amanda!"

06:40.366 --> 06:43.699
How sweet.
He made you a big silver rubber.

06:44.637 --> 06:47.697
- Jealous it's not in your size?
- A little.

06:48.841 --> 06:50.536
Now try this.

06:50.610 --> 06:55.547
"Viennese Chocolate Dream."
It's European.

06:58.785 --> 07:00.980
Mmm... Fancy.

07:02.255 --> 07:07.192
That's what I like about you, Nacho.
You enjoy the finer things.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.457
You know what all these
international flavors remind me of?

07:10.530 --> 07:13.055
We haven't talked about
my green card in a while.

07:13.132 --> 07:16.431
We got time.
Your court date's not for weeks.

07:16.502 --> 07:19.266
Now, will this be
my preliminary hearing?

07:19.338 --> 07:20.635
Mmm!

07:20.706 --> 07:25.370
Why does this Hazelnut Symphony
always make me want to dance?

07:25.445 --> 07:27.140
- Come on, Nacho.
- Constance...

07:27.213 --> 07:29.773
Mama wants to shake it!

07:29.849 --> 07:33.842
- Please! There's no music!
- Oh, there's music on these lips, baby.

07:36.155 --> 07:39.647
No! I can't! There's kids in the house!

07:39.725 --> 07:41.249
And I have a heart condition.

07:41.327 --> 07:43.795
See? Medicine.

07:43.863 --> 07:47.697
<i>Luigi Testa has designed a new line
of lingerie for women.</i>

07:47.767 --> 07:51.703
<i>Rumor has it that they are wooing
the notorious panty shunners</i>

07:51.771 --> 07:52.965
<i>Lohan, Spears...</i>

07:53.039 --> 07:57.442
- Hi there. A little peace offering.
- Hmm.

08:01.314 --> 08:05.842
An Hermes scarf. Pretty.
I'm sure my cleaning lady will love it.

08:07.653 --> 08:10.178
- Willie...
- Sorry, did we have an appointment?

08:10.256 --> 08:13.953
I know I'm just Creative Director,
but I still have a very full plate.

08:14.026 --> 08:17.393
Look, I wasn't counting
on any of this, but Daniel...

08:17.463 --> 08:20.694
...he turned his back
on our father for me.

08:20.766 --> 08:23.326
I have to at least give him a chance.

08:23.402 --> 08:26.496
I understand.

08:26.572 --> 08:31.566
Oh, I never noticed
what big man-hands you have.

08:33.980 --> 08:37.347
<i>... Bradford Meade's relationship
with his former lawyer.</i>

08:37.416 --> 08:41.147
<i>Taking over the case
is size-two legal eagle Grace Chin.</i>

08:41.220 --> 08:45.623
<i>[Grace] Mr. Meade is a pillar of
society, a loving father and husband...</i>

08:45.691 --> 08:46.885
What the hell?

08:47.326 --> 08:50.955
Didn't know?
That's your father's new lawyer.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.464
Lucky man. She's never lost a case.

08:53.533 --> 08:57.492
I guess things aren't working out
as either of us planned.

09:05.111 --> 09:09.571
Tasty. Looks like you showed her
who the alpha diva was.

09:09.649 --> 09:12.174
I'm glad she's giving
her brother a chance,

09:12.251 --> 09:15.618
'cause I assure you,
he's going to disappoint her.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.586
We'll make sure of it.

09:17.657 --> 09:20.125
Lady, you give me chills.

09:20.192 --> 09:22.126
Excuse me.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.088
Orthodontist?

09:26.165 --> 09:29.999
He's always a little too generous.
I don't even know what this is for.

09:30.069 --> 09:31.593
Somebody has a crush on you?

09:34.006 --> 09:35.940
[Daniel] What the hell is that?

09:44.216 --> 09:47.982
It's an Oswald Lorenzo. "The Amanda."

09:54.660 --> 09:58.187
I almost forgot. Grace Chin
called last night after you left.

09:58.264 --> 10:01.700
- Needs to talk to you. It's important.
- Yep, I already saw her.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.928
- When?
- This morning.

10:04.003 --> 10:06.528
- Didn't you have a meeting?
- Yeah, before that.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.836
- Weren't you at the gym?
- After that.

10:08.908 --> 10:12.571
- But the breakfast was at...
- Betty! What's with the third degree?

10:12.645 --> 10:15.773
I'm sorry, I just get
very involved in your schedule.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.015
You got a hair.

10:18.084 --> 10:21.212
I was standing next to Michelle
from Photo in the elevator.

10:21.287 --> 10:25.246
- Hasn't she been on maternity leave?
- OK! I'm sleeping with Grace Chin.

10:25.324 --> 10:27.485
- Are you happy?
- What?

10:27.560 --> 10:30.654
You can't let anyone know,
especially Alexis.

10:30.730 --> 10:32.698
I won't.

10:32.765 --> 10:35.734
But Daniel, do you really think
this is a good idea?

10:35.801 --> 10:39.601
No, it's a terrible idea. I mean,
I didn't mean for it to happen,

10:39.672 --> 10:42.641
but it did. And it was fun.

10:42.708 --> 10:45.506
I'll cool it off
before the trial starts.

10:45.578 --> 10:48.775
You're giving me that
"I'm disappointed in you" look again.

10:49.382 --> 10:53.318
- I'm sorry, it just happens.
- Look, I like her, OK?

10:55.988 --> 10:58.320
We just got the new
Malandrino collection in.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.689
Pick something out.
Grace will like that.

11:00.760 --> 11:04.628
This is the third piece he's sent.
Serious pain in my ass.

11:04.697 --> 11:07.598
- I'd understand if they were shagging.
- They're not!

11:07.667 --> 11:08.998
- They are!
- They're not!

11:09.068 --> 11:10.558
- They are?
- I said they're not!

11:10.636 --> 11:14.538
You say that like they are!
Oh, they are!

11:15.408 --> 11:17.467
I'm such a terrible liar!

11:17.543 --> 11:20.410
Look, you have to promise me,
you can't tell anybody!

11:20.479 --> 11:21.639
Of course I won't.

11:21.714 --> 11:24.911
But you can see how a missing dress
could be quite the scandal,

11:24.984 --> 11:28.476
what with all the murders and
sex changes going on in that family.

11:28.554 --> 11:30.317
- [Henry] There you are.
- Oh, hey.

11:30.389 --> 11:33.222
I thought you might need
a map to Charlie's party.

11:33.292 --> 11:37.661
- In the West Village, hard to find.
- Great, thanks.

11:37.730 --> 11:41.393
- Sure. Well, I'll see you later.
- OK.

11:42.168 --> 11:45.934
- Oh, hi, Christina.
- Yeah, I'm here. Here the whole time.

11:52.678 --> 11:54.236
What?

11:54.313 --> 11:57.612
OK, look, I know what you're
thinking, but they're my friends.

11:57.683 --> 12:00.914
You're going to his girlfriend's
birthday party?

12:00.986 --> 12:03.546
- Betty, he broke your heart.
- No, he didn't.

12:03.622 --> 12:06.250
Oh, really? Right.

12:06.325 --> 12:09.351
This one here was,
"Why doesn't he love me, Christina?"

12:09.428 --> 12:11.953
This one, "She took him
away from me, Christina!"

12:12.031 --> 12:14.522
And this one was
"Make her go away, Christina!"

12:14.600 --> 12:17.194
No. This one is gum.

12:17.269 --> 12:19.703
Betty, why would you do this
to yourself?

12:19.772 --> 12:24.675
Because I don't want
to lose Henry as a friend.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.871
I'm an adult. I can rise above this.

12:27.246 --> 12:29.737
Fair enough, but don't go alone.
Get a date.

12:29.815 --> 12:32.909
- Who? It's tonight.
- I don't know. There must be someone.

12:34.386 --> 12:36.980
Well, this is a surprise.

12:37.056 --> 12:40.583
[Betty] I need to come back in,
Dr. Farkas. My wire snapped.

12:40.659 --> 12:43.822
OK, great, I'll see you in an hour.

12:43.896 --> 12:45.420
Do it. Fast.

13:05.985 --> 13:09.716
[Daniel] I don't think we should be
following a postpartum depression piece

13:09.789 --> 13:14.089
- with a layout on baby doll dresses.
- We have a big problem!

13:14.160 --> 13:18.563
OK. Crazy time begins around 1:00.
We're in the middle of a meeting now.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.565
It's about our father.

13:22.168 --> 13:23.795
Excuse me.

13:23.869 --> 13:26.429
[Alexis] Grace Chin
has never lost a case!

13:26.505 --> 13:29.030
OK. Well, is that so bad?

13:29.175 --> 13:31.507
Do you want him
to spend his life in prison?

13:31.577 --> 13:34.102
- He's a murderer!
- [Sighs]

13:34.180 --> 13:37.547
What's going on with you?
Did you know about this?

13:37.616 --> 13:41.143
No, of course not. I don't even know
this Grace Chin woman.

13:41.220 --> 13:44.519
Alexis, he is still our father.

13:44.590 --> 13:46.785
Before you buy him a set of golf clubs,

13:46.859 --> 13:50.056
let me remind you he's the one
that made you feel worthless,

13:50.129 --> 13:52.324
drove our mother
to drink hand sanitizer,

13:52.398 --> 13:55.060
and told me he'd rather see me
dead than in a dress!

13:55.134 --> 13:56.829
The man is a monster.

14:01.874 --> 14:03.739
Juicy.

14:05.377 --> 14:09.541
- That is one angry she-male.
- What? What did I miss? Uh-oh!

14:13.085 --> 14:14.177
I would've told you.

14:16.021 --> 14:19.889
So you snapped your wire
eating a bagel?

14:19.959 --> 14:22.484
- Yep.
- Was the knife still in it?

14:24.363 --> 14:27.764
You're funny, Dr. Farkas.
And you have really good breath.

14:27.833 --> 14:31.462
Oh, it's part of the job requirement.
That, and trimmed nose hair.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.767
Oh, yeah, yep, that's good too!

14:33.839 --> 14:35.602
OK, we're all done here.

14:35.674 --> 14:38.666
So can I trust you to be
a little more careful this time?

14:38.744 --> 14:40.507
I'll try, but...

14:40.579 --> 14:42.740
...you might have to have
dinner with me

14:42.815 --> 14:45.283
to make sure I don't eat
anything too dangerous.

14:46.285 --> 14:51.484
Maybe I will. There's a lot
of dangerous food out there...

14:53.092 --> 14:54.923
...like apples.

14:54.994 --> 14:57.758
And carrots.

14:57.830 --> 15:01.926
And corn on the cob.
Are you asking me out?

15:02.001 --> 15:05.061
Not if you don't want to.
I don't know, maybe you do. I...

15:05.137 --> 15:09.733
I do. Yeah, I'd love to. Sure.

15:10.042 --> 15:12.704
[Groans] None of this will work.

15:12.778 --> 15:16.077
We can't use the Dior.
Sharon Stone wore it to the Globes.

15:16.148 --> 15:19.208
Please, she's over 40,
like anyone was even looking.

15:19.285 --> 15:20.752
But isn't she aging well?

15:20.819 --> 15:24.550
There is nothing more admirable
than a handsome woman.

15:24.623 --> 15:27.717
Stop stressing, Marc.
You'll lose even more hair.

15:27.793 --> 15:30.557
Where is the Catherine Malandrino?

15:31.830 --> 15:34.799
Uh... uh... I don't know.

15:34.867 --> 15:39.099
You don't know? That's not like you.
You know where everything is.

15:39.171 --> 15:42.732
Yep. I think, maybe,
it was signed out.

15:42.808 --> 15:46.244
The only one who can sign
anything out is the creative director

15:46.312 --> 15:49.076
or the editor in chief.
Did I sign it out, Marc?

15:49.148 --> 15:54.085
- No, you did not.
- Oh, I think it might have been Daniel.

15:54.153 --> 15:59.352
- Daniel. Really. Why?
- I've no idea.

15:59.425 --> 16:03.521
Well, maybe I should
call your little friend Betty.

16:03.595 --> 16:06.587
She'd love to hear how you helped
deliver the evidence

16:06.665 --> 16:08.633
to put her boss's father in prison.

16:08.701 --> 16:12.637
- You can't keep doing this to me.
- You're right. I can't.

16:12.705 --> 16:15.936
- Hello, Betty? It's Wilhelmina.
- OK, OK.

16:16.008 --> 16:17.805
Good hair today.

16:20.679 --> 16:23.648
Daniel gave it to Grace Chin as a gift.

16:23.716 --> 16:25.206
He said he doesn't know her.

16:25.284 --> 16:27.616
Why would Daniel
be giving her clothing?

16:27.686 --> 16:29.881
I could understand if...

16:32.925 --> 16:35.291
He's sleeping with his father's lawyer.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.093
Oh, that Daniel does not disappoint.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.564
[Laughs and sighs]

16:44.837 --> 16:49.365
- Papi? Are you in here?
- Grandpa?

16:49.508 --> 16:52.272
[Ignacio] Shh! Are you alone?

16:52.444 --> 16:57.006
What is going on?
I have been calling you for two hours.

16:57.082 --> 17:00.779
I unplugged the phone. Constance
keeps calling. Won't leave me alone.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.845
I like her. She gave me
a dollar to call her "Grandma."

17:03.922 --> 17:05.013
- Justin!
- OK, Papi,

17:05.089 --> 17:09.049
you're hiding in your house
from your caseworker. This is nuts.

17:09.127 --> 17:12.529
What's nuts is my caseworker
is stalking me.

17:12.598 --> 17:14.862
She danced with me
and then tried to kiss me!

17:14.933 --> 17:19.165
You mean you and Grandma?
What? I wanted the dollar.

17:22.074 --> 17:25.737
This is crossing over to a scary place.
You've got to report her.

17:25.810 --> 17:28.609
I'm not. I'm gonna keep her happy
until my court date.

17:28.680 --> 17:32.116
Don't put out the bait
unless you want the fish to eat.

17:32.184 --> 17:34.709
And that's a lot of fish.

17:34.787 --> 17:37.551
What can I do?
I'm not in a position to say anything.

17:39.224 --> 17:43.888
- [Constance] Yoo-hoo! Nacho!
- Papi, let me talk to her.

17:46.732 --> 17:50.463
I called Grace's office, she's picking
up a witness at the Grand Regent.

17:51.203 --> 17:54.036
Wait! What? The Grand Regent.
No, no! Call them back!

17:54.106 --> 17:56.836
- Find out where they're going!
- What's the big deal?

17:56.909 --> 17:59.002
She's going to talk to Brandy Shaloo!

18:00.813 --> 18:02.178
Who?

18:02.247 --> 18:06.183
[Wilhelmina] He's been lying to
Alexis about helping Bradford.

18:06.251 --> 18:09.482
Boinking the lawyer
is just icing on the cake.

18:09.555 --> 18:12.319
- Yummy.
- Too gay.

18:12.391 --> 18:15.019
Now, I want you to follow Daniel
everywhere he goes.

18:15.094 --> 18:18.291
If you get me proof of the affair,
I can pit Alexis against him.

18:18.363 --> 18:20.558
They'll be so busy
taking each other down,

18:20.632 --> 18:22.930
they won't even notice
you taking over.

18:23.001 --> 18:25.469
Oh, fly, my pretty. Fly!

18:25.537 --> 18:28.097
You thought "yummy"
was too gay? [stutters]

18:35.614 --> 18:39.209
[Grace] So how long was your husband
having the affair with Fey Sommers?

18:39.284 --> 18:43.050
Let's see, when was that
MC Hammer guy hitting the scene?

18:43.122 --> 18:44.749
[Grace] I had those pants.

18:45.357 --> 18:48.849
- Oh, crap.
- [Daniel] Isn't this a coincidence?

18:48.927 --> 18:51.862
Hi, Mom! Welcome back
from wherever it is you've been.

18:51.930 --> 18:53.420
How did you ever find her?

18:53.499 --> 18:57.026
Called her home and her housekeeper
said she was at The Grand Regent.

18:58.170 --> 19:00.934
I may have told Magdalena
about Brandy Shaloo.

19:01.006 --> 19:03.975
Grace said that my testimony
will help your father.

19:04.042 --> 19:06.602
Good, good. Mind if I sit in?

19:06.678 --> 19:09.511
Daniel, I really need to get
through these questions.

19:09.581 --> 19:11.208
Oh, they've got pumpkin soup.

19:11.283 --> 19:14.684
As I was saying, Mrs. Meade,
if I put you on the witness stand,

19:14.753 --> 19:17.722
I have to ask you about your feelings
towards Fey Sommers.

19:17.789 --> 19:21.589
She was a conniving,
manipulative bitch who deserved...

19:21.660 --> 19:24.322
A little forgiveness
and understanding, right?

19:25.364 --> 19:27.423
Why does it say "MC Hammer?"

19:29.301 --> 19:31.166
Excuse me, I have to take this.

19:36.375 --> 19:39.640
Do not yell at me.
You know, you've become a yeller.

19:39.711 --> 19:43.306
I won't yell, but you need to get out.
Stay away from this woman.

19:43.382 --> 19:46.249
I won't incriminate myself.
Trust my judgment.

19:46.318 --> 19:47.615
Really? I gotta tell you,

19:47.686 --> 19:50.120
your judgment has been
pretty terrific so far.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.783
If it weren't for you,
none of us would be in this.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.018
Just trying to help.

19:54.092 --> 19:57.118
Don't. Go back, lock the door,
don't answer for anybody.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.029
If you really want to help Dad,
just stay out of the way.

20:00.098 --> 20:02.566
How much more damage
do you want to do to us?

20:12.311 --> 20:13.300
Ooh!

20:15.781 --> 20:17.976
- What?
- I know you.

20:18.050 --> 20:22.214
You're the slut from the Jil Sander
party. Oswald Lorenzo?

20:22.287 --> 20:26.018
Oh, right. You were the one
who was all up in his pooch.

20:26.091 --> 20:29.720
Listen, if you weren't so desperate,

20:29.795 --> 20:32.059
he might have made
"The Amanda" for you.

20:32.130 --> 20:34.530
But he would've called it
"The Skank-Whore."

20:48.747 --> 20:52.513
- Hey, Betty. I'm glad you made it.
- Hey.

20:52.584 --> 20:55.951
Henry, Charlie,
this is my friend, Dr. Farkas.

20:56.021 --> 20:59.582
You can call me Gabe.
Nice to meet you.

20:59.658 --> 21:01.717
- Hi.
- This is for the birthday girl.

21:05.364 --> 21:06.388
A tongue scraper.

21:06.465 --> 21:10.231
- That's what that is.
- So many people forget the tongue.

21:11.036 --> 21:13.163
Well, now I won't.

21:13.505 --> 21:17.202
Oh, is that the chocolate
raspberry cake from Magnolia?

21:17.276 --> 21:20.837
Charlie's not much of a cake person,
she told me to pick my favorite.

21:20.912 --> 21:22.504
My God, that's my favorite!

21:24.650 --> 21:28.484
- I'll get drinks? What do you like?
- Something fizzy.

21:29.021 --> 21:31.922
So you didn't say
you were bringing someone.

21:31.990 --> 21:33.787
Oh, I thought that would be OK.

21:33.859 --> 21:37.761
Oh, yeah. Oh, and he's cute, Betty.
And a dentist.

21:37.829 --> 21:40.320
- Orthodontist.
- Thumbs up.

21:40.399 --> 21:42.663
How long have you been
seeing each other?

21:42.734 --> 21:44.668
Because you haven't said anything.

21:44.736 --> 21:49.400
Really? Oh, well, we've known
each other for a while, and...

21:49.474 --> 21:50.964
...he's a terrific guy.

21:51.043 --> 21:55.742
You two are perfect together.
And the chemistry is just obvious.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.247
Right, Henry?

21:57.316 --> 22:00.513
I don't know. Well, I just met the guy.

22:02.654 --> 22:06.317
Well, I'm all about vibes
and I am definitely feeling this one.

22:06.391 --> 22:10.122
You guys should give me your star signs.
I'll totally do your chart.

22:10.529 --> 22:12.963
Yeah, OK.

22:16.201 --> 22:18.135
Sure I'm gonna look like Beyonce?

22:18.203 --> 22:21.934
When I'm through with you,
Jay-Z is gonna be ringing your alarm.

22:22.007 --> 22:26.535
I don't need to hear from him. I've
only got eyes for one man right now.

22:26.611 --> 22:29.273
I'm so glad you offered
to do this, sugar.

22:29.348 --> 22:32.112
I need some insight.

22:32.184 --> 22:35.642
Does your daddy like it
up, down, or all around?

22:36.521 --> 22:38.546
We are still talking about hair, right?

22:38.623 --> 22:40.056
[Laughs]

22:42.427 --> 22:45.555
It's been a long time since
I've met a man who made me tingle.

22:45.630 --> 22:48.895
- Ow!
- Sorry, I'm still new at this.

22:48.967 --> 22:51.902
But I'm not surprised
you say that about my dad.

22:51.970 --> 22:53.961
He does have a way with the ladies.

22:54.039 --> 22:56.974
Ladies? Don't tell me
I've got competition.

22:57.042 --> 22:58.407
You didn't hear it from me,

22:58.477 --> 23:01.378
but there is somebody
that he's been seeing for a while.

23:01.446 --> 23:04.472
What? Why didn't he tell me this?

23:04.549 --> 23:08.349
Because he's a decent guy. He doesn't
want to hurt anybody's feelings,

23:08.420 --> 23:11.981
especially not someone
who has done so much for him.

23:12.057 --> 23:16.050
Oh. Well, he didn't need
to keep that from me.

23:16.161 --> 23:17.594
So you're OK?

23:17.662 --> 23:20.529
Hey, if he doesn't want me,
his loss, right?

23:20.599 --> 23:21.861
Right!

23:21.933 --> 23:25.334
You know what? The hell
with Beyonce. Do me like Mariah.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.429
- All right!
- [Sings in high pitch]

23:28.874 --> 23:29.863
OK, bye.

23:29.941 --> 23:33.240
Hey, I got some bad news.
My mom had to run.

23:33.311 --> 23:36.007
- No, I've gotta talk...
- She'll call tomorrow.

23:36.081 --> 23:38.379
- Let me just tell...
- No. You can't.

23:39.050 --> 23:43.111
- Why not?
- Because... I really want you.

23:43.555 --> 23:44.886
- What?
- Grace...

23:44.956 --> 23:47.083
...you look really hot

23:47.159 --> 23:50.788
in that brown wool suit.

23:51.163 --> 23:52.323
Daniel!

23:52.397 --> 23:54.456
When will you learn
to live in the moment?

23:54.533 --> 23:57.297
- You're insane.
- Am I? Come on.

23:57.369 --> 23:59.394
- You know you want to.
- We're in public!

23:59.471 --> 24:03.567
- It's kinda hot, right?
- All right, you've got six minutes.

24:09.548 --> 24:14.508
- [Grace giggles]
- [Gags]

24:15.053 --> 24:18.079
[Grace] Come on, Daniel! Come on.

24:18.857 --> 24:22.520
[Charlie] We would've had the party
at our house, but we're redecorating.

24:22.594 --> 24:26.587
We're not redecorating. We just
bought a new couch. It's purple.

24:27.332 --> 24:29.732
Purple? You like purple?

24:29.801 --> 24:33.237
Well, it's a moon color.
It's empowering.

24:33.305 --> 24:37.139
But buying a couch is the first step.
You know what's next, don't you?

24:37.209 --> 24:39.769
What? A coffee table?

24:41.379 --> 24:43.438
No, I was gonna say "a mortgage."

24:43.515 --> 24:44.812
[Chuckles] Oh, right.

24:46.952 --> 24:47.941
It's just a couch.

24:49.521 --> 24:51.113
[Slow song plays]

24:51.189 --> 24:56.058
Oh, I love this.
Henry, come dance with me.

24:56.127 --> 24:57.719
OK.

25:04.603 --> 25:06.002
Betty?

25:06.071 --> 25:09.598
What? Oh! Yes, of course.

25:23.889 --> 25:24.981
[Buzzing]

25:25.056 --> 25:27.684
I don't know what I've done,
but you're vibrating.

25:27.759 --> 25:29.693
Oh, sorry.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.997
<i>- Hello?
- Betty?</i>

25:33.064 --> 25:36.522
It's Claire Meade.
Am I interrupting something?

25:36.601 --> 25:38.694
I'm at a friend's birthday.

25:38.770 --> 25:42.638
Good, then you're free. I need you
to bring me a corporate credit card.

25:42.707 --> 25:46.199
It's an emergency.
I'm at the Grand Regent.

25:47.879 --> 25:49.870
Is it OK? Is there anything I can do?

25:49.948 --> 25:51.973
How about going
to the Grand Regent?

25:52.050 --> 25:53.745
Am I that good of a slow dancer?

25:53.818 --> 25:56.343
No, no, that's not what I meant.

25:56.421 --> 25:58.912
I... I need to run an errand.

25:58.990 --> 26:01.481
- [Betty] Will you come with me?
- Yeah.

26:08.333 --> 26:10.358
[Betty] Why are you running away?

26:10.435 --> 26:12.164
I'm taking the first flight

26:12.237 --> 26:15.035
to wherever it is that people go
when they disappear.

26:15.106 --> 26:16.903
You don't need to disappear.

26:16.975 --> 26:21.503
Oh, yes I do. I destroyed my family.
Daniel made that quite clear.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.640
- They're better off without me.
- No, they're not.

26:24.716 --> 26:27.947
Betty, I have already
caused them so much pain.

26:28.019 --> 26:30.681
I need to go far away,
where I don't hurt them.

26:30.755 --> 26:33.349
You're not thinking clearly.
Let's call Daniel.

26:33.425 --> 26:36.053
Maybe you're right.
Let me see your phone.

26:40.432 --> 26:43.731
Did that jump out of my hand?
Now let me have the credit card.

26:43.802 --> 26:45.201
No!

26:45.270 --> 26:47.898
I don't have it.

26:47.973 --> 26:50.464
I left it at home, in Queens.

26:50.542 --> 26:52.305
It's on the way to the airport.

26:52.377 --> 26:54.572
Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt,

26:54.646 --> 26:57.114
but I'm parked
in a horse and carriage zone.

26:57.182 --> 26:58.581
Oh. Who is this?

26:58.650 --> 27:02.086
This is Dr. Farkas.
We are sort of on a date.

27:02.153 --> 27:05.145
Doctor? I thought it was
the accountant you liked.

27:05.223 --> 27:07.589
No! No, Mrs. Meade, no!

27:07.659 --> 27:10.389
He has a girlfriend.
That was a very long time ago.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.623
We're friends. We're just friends.

27:12.697 --> 27:14.324
I believe you.

27:16.134 --> 27:18.967
Well, this is an awkward moment.

27:20.572 --> 27:21.732
Leave it to me.

27:21.806 --> 27:23.398
I kill everything.

27:26.077 --> 27:27.977
Sex on a dirty floor.

27:28.046 --> 27:31.015
Daniel Meade, always a class act.

27:31.082 --> 27:34.051
So Marc has pleased you?

27:34.119 --> 27:36.053
Stop talking in the third person

27:36.121 --> 27:38.419
and take your pick
from the goodie basket.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.549
I have a delivery to make.

27:40.925 --> 27:42.859
[Giggling and moaning]

27:42.927 --> 27:45.862
Four, three, two, one...

27:45.930 --> 27:48.330
[Alexis] That lying bastard!

27:48.400 --> 27:52.200
Alexis, I have some
expense report issues to go over.

27:54.172 --> 27:57.335
Oh, I'm sorry,
did I interrupt something?

27:57.909 --> 28:02.005
My brother lied to me.
He's sleeping with Grace Chin.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.207
He said he didn't know her.

28:04.282 --> 28:08.184
Interesting. You trusted
Daniel and he betrayed you.

28:08.253 --> 28:12.485
I went through something
very similar with a former friend.

28:19.097 --> 28:22.294
- [Knocking sound]
- [Amanda grunts] Ow! Oh...

28:22.367 --> 28:26.235
- Help! Please, help! Help me!
- Hello?

28:27.205 --> 28:29.070
You all right in there?

28:30.275 --> 28:33.176
Oh, thank God.
I haven't been able to pee all day.

28:33.244 --> 28:35.644
And I was simply trying
to stand over the toilet

28:35.714 --> 28:38.080
and now I can't get down.
OK, help.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.676
[Sighs]

28:41.019 --> 28:43.783
Oh... There we go... [groans]

28:45.690 --> 28:48.386
You do know I have to talk
to your mother tomorrow.

28:48.460 --> 28:50.928
You can try, but she might
disappear again.

28:50.995 --> 28:54.487
That's what she does, disappear.
I told you, she's nuts.

28:54.566 --> 28:57.364
Good. Because that'll be her defense.

28:57.435 --> 29:01.667
- What?
- Daniel, I know she did it.

29:03.341 --> 29:05.536
Grace, that's not true.

29:05.610 --> 29:08.704
Every time I bring up your mother,
you get all freaked out

29:08.780 --> 29:10.577
and then you want to have sex.

29:10.648 --> 29:14.277
You either have some weird
Oedipal thing or your mother's guilty.

29:14.352 --> 29:17.287
So? Do you want to have sex?

29:17.355 --> 29:21.314
I know you're trying
to protect her, but hear me out.

29:21.392 --> 29:24.225
- If she confesses, I can help her.
- No, not an option.

29:24.295 --> 29:26.763
Have her doctor testify
that she was paranoid.

29:26.831 --> 29:28.856
You want her to plead insanity?

29:28.933 --> 29:31.902
I'll argue that she believed
Fey was going to kill her.

29:31.970 --> 29:33.631
It was "kill or be killed."

29:33.705 --> 29:35.297
You think you can win this way?

29:35.373 --> 29:36.738
I know I can.

29:37.342 --> 29:39.537
[Alexis] Well, isn't this a surprise?

29:39.611 --> 29:40.908
What are you doing here?

29:40.979 --> 29:44.608
All those angry women
and you never changed the locks?

29:44.682 --> 29:46.616
You must be Grace Chin. Hi.

29:46.684 --> 29:49.778
Daniel, that woman
you claimed you've never met?

29:49.854 --> 29:51.822
She's in your bed.

29:57.962 --> 30:01.193
What a cute little house.
I could put it right in my pocket.

30:01.966 --> 30:04.992
You've got you're hands full.
I think I'm gonna head off.

30:05.069 --> 30:07.936
No, no. Stay. This is just
gonna take a couple minutes

30:08.006 --> 30:12.136
and then we can get back to our date.
We could grab a drink or get some pie.

30:12.210 --> 30:14.804
- I love pie. What's your favorite?
- Rhubarb.

30:14.879 --> 30:18.144
Oh, me too. Actually, blueberry.
But rhubarb sounds fun.

30:18.216 --> 30:21.447
You should steer away from blueberry.
It stains your teeth.

30:21.519 --> 30:22.747
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.812
Can't bottle this kind of chemistry.

30:24.889 --> 30:27.722
Betty, there's a flight
to Vladivostok at midnight.

30:27.792 --> 30:30.693
They just opened a W there.
I need that credit card.

30:30.762 --> 30:33.390
You don't need to do this.
You didn't do anything.

30:33.464 --> 30:34.931
I killed Fey Sommers.

30:34.999 --> 30:38.298
Um... OK, I know you think so,

30:38.369 --> 30:40.837
but you make things up
when you're drinking.

30:40.905 --> 30:43.965
Well, I'm not drinking now.

30:44.042 --> 30:46.374
I had her brake lines cut.

30:46.444 --> 30:50.710
I followed her for 18 miles
till the fluid ran out.

30:50.782 --> 30:54.650
I watched her crash into a tree
and burn and burn and burn.

30:55.286 --> 30:56.583
I'm gonna go.

30:56.654 --> 30:58.383
Oh, no. Stay, stay.

30:58.456 --> 31:01.118
It's from a movie.
It's just a game we play.

31:01.192 --> 31:05.356
<i>Guess the quote.
That was Firestarter. My turn.</i>

31:05.430 --> 31:07.398
<i>- "You complete me."
- Jerry Maguire.</i>

31:07.465 --> 31:09.330
Yes! Wow, you're good at this.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.459
Betty, the credit card?

31:11.536 --> 31:14.004
Oh. OK, you two keep playing.

31:14.873 --> 31:18.866
Oh. "Life is like a box of chocolates."

31:19.544 --> 31:21.808
I've killed once. I'll kill again.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.576
- I don't know that one.
- Hello.

31:24.649 --> 31:28.085
Oh, you must be Betty's father.
Claire Meade, Daniel's mother.

31:28.152 --> 31:31.519
- Hi. And who is this?
- This is Betty's date.

31:31.589 --> 31:34.080
You must be Henry.
I've heard a lot about you.

31:34.158 --> 31:36.752
No, no, no. The accountant
has a girlfriend.

31:36.828 --> 31:39.092
This is the orthodontist.

31:39.163 --> 31:41.961
Oh, you seem nice.

31:42.634 --> 31:45.762
I've seen the accountant.
Much hotter.

31:45.837 --> 31:47.702
Betty, I really gotta go.

31:47.772 --> 31:51.105
[Betty] No! Stay! At least
I owe you a cup of coffee!

31:51.175 --> 31:54.576
I'll make some. Mrs. Meade,
what do you take in your coffee?

31:54.646 --> 31:57.843
- Vodka and ice. Hold the coffee.
- OK.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.611
Well, thank you.

32:05.823 --> 32:07.415
Come on, Daniel, come on.

32:07.492 --> 32:09.483
<i>[Grace] Come on, Daniel! Come on!</i>

32:10.795 --> 32:12.092
What do you want?

32:12.163 --> 32:14.324
I want her to recuse herself
from the case.

32:14.399 --> 32:18.062
My affair with Daniel doesn't affect
my ability to defend your father.

32:18.136 --> 32:20.627
Hope the judge thinks so
when I give this to him.

32:20.705 --> 32:22.798
Or maybe I'll put it on the Internet.

32:22.874 --> 32:26.935
People out there would love to see
a lawyer getting screwed for a change.

32:27.011 --> 32:30.242
OK. The Chin is done here.

32:30.315 --> 32:32.215
No, no. Wait!
What are you saying?

32:32.283 --> 32:34.615
Saying she doesn't want
to ruin her career.

32:34.686 --> 32:38.247
This isn't about my career! I don't
have time or patience for you people.

32:38.323 --> 32:41.486
I have enough murderers
to put back on the street,

32:41.559 --> 32:44.392
and their families
actually support them.

32:44.462 --> 32:47.625
You don't need a lawyer,
you need a good shrink.

32:47.699 --> 32:49.564
And maybe a closer shave.

32:50.301 --> 32:51.700
How could you do this?

32:51.769 --> 32:53.896
How could you help our father?

32:53.972 --> 32:56.770
Our father's innocent. Mom killed Fey.

32:56.841 --> 33:00.106
- What?
- Why do you think I keep this from you?

33:00.178 --> 33:03.079
You never listen to me.
I can't talk to you! Mom is guilty.

33:03.147 --> 33:05.980
You just ran the best lawyer
in town out my door.

33:06.751 --> 33:08.981
You just put our mother in prison.

33:10.922 --> 33:13.322
[Pounding on door]

33:15.259 --> 33:18.353
- So you're the one.
- I beg your pardon.

33:18.429 --> 33:19.953
You're the ho stealing my man.

33:22.233 --> 33:26.294
It's unlikely that we would have
the same man in common.

33:26.371 --> 33:28.839
We certainly don't have
the same hairdresser.

33:28.906 --> 33:30.601
Oh, you just crossed the line.

33:31.876 --> 33:34.504
Did you just shove me?

33:40.318 --> 33:43.446
- Hey. Oh, you just slapped me.
- Wait, what's going on?

33:43.521 --> 33:45.546
I have no idea how this started.

33:45.623 --> 33:48.888
We were supposed to get a credit card
and leave the country.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.690
You're gonna marry this
bag of bones for a green card?

33:51.763 --> 33:53.060
Bag of bones?

33:53.131 --> 33:55.031
I'm not marrying anybody.

33:55.099 --> 33:58.159
Constance, please, can we talk
about this in the kitchen?

33:58.236 --> 34:00.431
- Who's carrot cake?
- That's Betty's date.

34:00.505 --> 34:03.406
- Oh, so that's the accountant?
- No, no. That's Henry.

34:03.474 --> 34:05.840
What's with you and
the skinny blonde bitch?

34:05.910 --> 34:09.368
Mrs. Meade is not my girlfriend.

34:09.447 --> 34:13.042
And by the way, Constance,
neither are you.

34:13.117 --> 34:14.414
Why are you stalking me?

34:14.485 --> 34:16.976
Excuse me? I am not stalking you.

34:17.054 --> 34:20.286
I am monitoring an illegal immigrant
who is a flight risk.

34:20.358 --> 34:21.757
I'm not flying anywhere.

34:21.826 --> 34:24.920
Hey, let me make a cup
of one of your international coffees.

34:26.496 --> 34:28.726
Hey, hey, hey, hey! What is this?

34:28.800 --> 34:33.737
A tracking device, for your own good,
before you do something you regret.

34:33.804 --> 34:35.670
Constance, be reasonable.

34:35.739 --> 34:37.935
And with this tracking device,

34:38.009 --> 34:41.536
I will know where you are
every minute of every day.

34:41.612 --> 34:44.877
- You step outside this house...
- [alarm sounds]

34:44.949 --> 34:46.610
...and I will know.

34:46.684 --> 34:49.619
And I'm guessing
Miss Fancy Pants out there

34:49.687 --> 34:52.053
don't live in this 'hood.

34:52.123 --> 34:55.820
What was that noise?
What are you doing?

34:55.893 --> 34:56.917
Leaving.

34:56.994 --> 35:00.020
No! I'm almost done here
and then we can go get that pie.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.362
- Betty, there's not going to be pie.
- Why?

35:02.433 --> 35:04.924
It's obvious you still have
feelings for Henry.

35:05.002 --> 35:07.869
What? No, I don't.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.839
Betty, I could see it at the party,

35:09.907 --> 35:12.307
and I think everyone else
can see it too.

35:16.647 --> 35:20.105
Oh... [sighs] OK...

35:22.320 --> 35:23.378
I'm sorry.

35:23.454 --> 35:26.446
I really do think you're a great guy.

35:27.492 --> 35:30.791
I guess I just asked you out
for all the wrong reasons.

35:30.862 --> 35:35.265
It's OK. I should probably know better
than to date my patients anyway.

35:36.734 --> 35:38.929
Especially the cute ones.

35:48.312 --> 35:51.679
I will see you at your
appointment next month.

35:51.749 --> 35:52.807
OK.

35:56.254 --> 35:58.745
"Here's looking at you, kid."

35:58.823 --> 36:00.518
<i>Casablanca.</i>

36:10.101 --> 36:13.537
That was very sweet.
Sticky, but sweet.

36:14.438 --> 36:16.838
Tick-tock, Betty.
I have a flight to catch.

36:16.908 --> 36:18.535
Now where's that credit card?

36:29.754 --> 36:32.621
OK. I got it.

36:34.992 --> 36:37.586
Betty, that's a library card.

36:38.729 --> 36:42.597
Oh, my God. I must've checked out
books with the credit card.

36:42.667 --> 36:45.602
- I'll go call them.
- Betty, you're lying.

36:45.670 --> 36:49.071
With so many saints in your
living room, how can you lie like that?

36:49.140 --> 36:51.301
You called Daniel, didn't you?

36:51.375 --> 36:53.036
I had to.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.578
Look, if you did
what you said you did,

36:56.647 --> 36:59.172
then your family has to deal with this.

36:59.250 --> 37:00.911
Family?

37:01.619 --> 37:03.678
There's not much of a family left.

37:03.754 --> 37:07.053
My husband spent 20 years of our
marriage in love with another woman,

37:07.124 --> 37:09.024
and she flaunted it in front of me.

37:10.861 --> 37:14.456
I watched the man I love
love someone else...

37:16.267 --> 37:17.700
...and it killed me.

37:20.271 --> 37:24.833
Promise me you won't make
the same mistake that I did, Betty.

37:26.510 --> 37:29.104
I promise.

37:37.221 --> 37:39.246
What do I do?

37:39.323 --> 37:40.654
I don't know.

37:41.792 --> 37:45.558
But I don't think that
running away is the answer.

37:46.564 --> 37:48.225
I mean...

37:49.533 --> 37:51.797
...won't it just keep following you?

37:51.869 --> 37:56.636
Maybe we both need to be strong

37:56.707 --> 38:00.268
and face the things
that we don't want to,

38:00.344 --> 38:02.642
no matter how scary they are.

38:03.481 --> 38:08.544
Because that's the only way
we can live with ourselves.

38:09.787 --> 38:11.982
You're a smart girl, Betty.

38:18.162 --> 38:21.996
I need to make a phone call.

38:26.971 --> 38:29.667
Reporting live in Queens,
where Claire Meade,

38:29.740 --> 38:32.038
wife of publishing magnate
Bradford Meade,

38:32.109 --> 38:34.077
turned herself in to the authorities.

38:34.145 --> 38:37.342
The DA has confirmed
that Mrs. Meade has confessed

38:37.415 --> 38:41.112
<i>to the murder of former Mode
editor-in-chief Fey Sommers,</i>

38:41.185 --> 38:45.053
<i>the crime for which Mrs. Meade's
husband is currently in custody.</i>

38:45.122 --> 38:49.081
<i>Further inquiries revealed that Mr.
Meade's defense attorney, Grace Chin,</i>

38:49.160 --> 38:51.287
<i>has removed herself from the case.</i>

38:51.362 --> 38:53.193
That's what I call brotherly love.

38:53.264 --> 38:57.132
It's a shame, really.
That family's just beyond repair.

38:57.201 --> 39:00.102
<i>Bradford is expected to be
released in the next 24 hours</i>

39:00.171 --> 39:01.638
<i>and murder charges dropped.</i>

39:01.706 --> 39:06.143
Alexis is not going to like that.
She didn't spend much time at the top.

39:06.210 --> 39:09.839
Nice work. Both of you.

39:20.858 --> 39:24.726
Oswald Lorenzo
has another treat for you.

39:24.795 --> 39:27.855
Listen, you trendy little monkey.

39:27.932 --> 39:31.060
You can tell your boss
he completely humiliated me.

39:31.135 --> 39:33.467
I have rubber burns all over my ass.

39:33.537 --> 39:35.732
It took two sticks of butter
to get the top off.

39:35.806 --> 39:37.364
Fashion is pain.

39:38.008 --> 39:40.033
That dress looked awful.

39:40.111 --> 39:43.808
Of course it did.
You didn't have the hat.

39:44.915 --> 39:46.348
It comes with a hat?

39:48.052 --> 39:49.849
I totally have a hat face.

39:49.920 --> 39:51.547
I know.

39:55.993 --> 39:57.858
Enjoy.

40:02.133 --> 40:05.398
Oh, my God. She's wearing it!

40:05.469 --> 40:06.902
Oh, she loves it!

40:06.971 --> 40:08.734
She looks like a traffic cone.

40:09.473 --> 40:11.873
That'll teach that bitch
to shove me in a bar.

40:18.649 --> 40:19.980
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

40:20.050 --> 40:22.484
You left early last night.
I didn't... I mean...

40:22.553 --> 40:25.283
Charlie and I didn't get a chance
to talk to you very much.

40:25.356 --> 40:28.223
The Claire Meade thing
really spiraled out of control.

40:28.292 --> 40:29.350
What was that about?

40:29.427 --> 40:32.225
<i>It's a long story.
Most of it's in The New York Times.</i>

40:32.830 --> 40:35.492
Wanna get lunch with me
and Charlie today?

40:35.566 --> 40:37.090
I can't.

40:40.371 --> 40:42.703
OK. Maybe tomorrow then?

40:42.773 --> 40:45.401
No, I can't.

40:47.411 --> 40:52.110
I can't spend time with you
and your girlfriend, Henry.

40:52.183 --> 40:53.980
It's just not...

40:56.053 --> 40:57.918
...good for me.

40:57.988 --> 41:01.651
Sure. OK.

41:03.260 --> 41:06.593
I guess I just thought
we could all be friends.

41:06.664 --> 41:10.361
Yeah, I just...

41:10.434 --> 41:12.629
I don't really think that I...

41:12.703 --> 41:16.161
I can do that right now.

41:17.208 --> 41:19.073
So...

41:19.143 --> 41:20.667
...what does that make us?

41:22.112 --> 41:25.138
Two people who work
in the same building.

41:26.116 --> 41:27.447
Oh.

41:29.987 --> 41:31.318
OK.

41:43.467 --> 41:45.196
I saved you a slice.

41:49.907 --> 41:51.898
<i>[Aretha Franklin: Do Right Woman]</i>

42:02.853 --> 42:04.514
[Telephone ringing]

42:05.155 --> 42:08.352
Daniel Meade's office,
this is Betty Suarez.

42:08.425 --> 42:12.156
Yes. What time is best
to return your call?

42:12.229 --> 42:14.823
Great, I'll let him know.
Have a good day.

42:15.900 --> 42:18.368
Daniel Meade's office,
this is Betty Suarez.

42:18.435 --> 42:21.700
No, he's not in at the moment.
Can I take a message?
